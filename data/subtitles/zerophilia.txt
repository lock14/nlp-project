1
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,800
Hey!

2
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:54,900
Are you okay?

3
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:55,800
My God, are you allright?

4
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,000
Yeah.

5
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,800
How did you even get here?

6
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,000
There's no road, there's
barely even a trail.

7
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I don't know.
I'm from England.

8
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,000
Oh, it's ...
it's okay.

9
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Are you alone out here?

10
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,800
Yeah.

11
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,300
You want coming to my camper?

12
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,400
Little warm apple kringel.

13
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,600
Ah...

14
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,200
What is it?

15
00:02:28,743 --> 00:02:32,933
How did I know? How did I 
know that you'll be so incredible?

16
00:02:33,829 --> 00:02:35,862
Ah! It is no idea!

17
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,000
Hey... Hey Keenan!
Come here, man.

18
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,600
Keenan, come here.
Quick.

19
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,800
<i>What?</i>

20
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,800
Come here!

21
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,200
What?

22
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,300
Look at my chest.

23
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,400
Yeah...

24
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,700
Oh, I had hair, man.

25
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,400
Okay, not a lot of hair.

26
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,600
But, I mean, you've seen me some, right?

27
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,200
What?

28
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,600
I see that look.
What?

29
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,600
What is it with you, man!? You're smarter
than me, you're better-lookin' than me.

30
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,900
I'm not...

31
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,200
I know.

32
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,800
I'm just saying, you can
get ev'ry girl you want.

33
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,400
Easy for you to say, you've got Janine.

34
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,000
So what do you think?

35
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,800
You're joking, right?

36
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,200
It's remarkable, a very retro.
I thought you were gettin' a pick-up?

37
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,600
Yeah, I changed my mind.

38
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:38,900
Okay, okay ...

39
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,000
My dad loves this all things.

40
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,400
'Cause you wanted to buy one
fixed it up.

41
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,400
I think it's great.

42
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,600
Yeah, it's awesome, it's diesel.

43
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,800
Fuck you, you think it's stupid.

44
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,400
What?

45
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,500
What?

46
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,400
Oh, my God.
Did you get laid?

47
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,900
Finally!

48
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,800
I didn't say a word,
I swear to God.

49
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,700
I knew it.
Who is she?

50
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,000
Camping.
Total stranger.

51
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,000
Congratulations.

52
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,800
I wanted hear all about it,
but I gotta get to Physics.

53
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,600
The truck is great.

54
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,800
See ya', hottie.

55
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:29,600
Could you find anything else to call me
other than every guy in the world would say?

56
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,600
Sweetheart...

57
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,200
Baby...

58
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,400
Thing very melange.

59
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,000
You call me honey.

60
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,400
Okay, see ya' tonight.

61
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,000
So, this is gonna be, like, your car?

62
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,200
Yeah.

63
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,200
First off...

64
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,000
that woman...

65
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,000
we didn't go all the way, you know?

66
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,400
Yeah, okay. So?

67
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,800
So, technically...
think I'm still virgin?

68
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,500
Were you inside her?

69
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,800
Yeah.

70
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,900
It counts.
Next?

71
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,700
What?

72
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,600
Well...

73
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,000
I sort of been having
this dream...

74
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,400
You know, forget it.
I'm not telling you.

75
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,800
What!?

76
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,200
Come on, man, you know enough
of my secrets to get me shot.

77
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,800
Sharon's mom on
Thanksgiving?...

78
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,600
What the fuck dream
is there you can't tell me?

79
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,400
Oh...

80
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,800
It's about part of
me gettin' smaller.

81
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,400
The important part.

82
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,800
The thing is...

83
00:07:21,729 --> 00:07:24,000
I think the dream is real.

84
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,000
Oh, give me a fuckin' break, man.
You're not thirteen!

85
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,200
Screw you, maybe I
caught something.

86
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:37,200
It's pratically the first time in about five
years you haven't had an hard on.

87
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,800
I think it's good you
bought this truck.

88
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,200
You're too "stoned" to drive.

89
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,600
No, I'm not.

90
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,000
Yeah, I got it.
I got it.

91
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,000
I can do the gasket
for twenty bucks..

92
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,600
But new T-sprocks,
for this thing...

93
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,700
I'm looking at two, maybe three hundred?

94
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,200
Uh, shit...

95
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,600
You think that I hold off on that?

96
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,700
No skin off my ass...

97
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,800
But a few days...
weeks...

98
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,000
blow your whole
transmission.

99
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Ah, Jeez....
I don't know, I...

100
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,800
Probably shouldn't got this thing, uh?

101
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,700
No, it's cool.

102
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,200
475 horsepower...

103
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,800
25 inch wheels...

104
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,400
Chrome grill.

105
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,200
You did good.

106
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,400
Let me check in the back.

107
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,400
See if we got a used set.

108
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,600
Oh, ***
Thanks, man.

109
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,400
Shit!

110
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,800
Yeah...

111
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,000
Yeah, 6 bucks.

112
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,400
Gasket.

113
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,400
It's not my wrench.

114
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,200
It's my truck.

115
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,500
What's wrong with it?

116
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:01,400
Oh, you have to know just needs a new gasket...

117
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,200
...and a couple T-sprocks....

118
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,400
...the flanges are sheared off.
You know, it's no a big deal.

119
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,800
You gotta becareful
with my brother, Max.

120
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,600
He's sellin' you "T-sprocks?"

121
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,800
Yeah.

122
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,700
There's no such thing.

123
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,400
Last week he sold a whole
set to Mrs. Gustafson:

124
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,200
six hundred bucks.

125
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,600
Oh ...

126
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,400
My name's Michelle, by the way.

127
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,800
Yeah.
From New York, right?

128
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,400
Poli-Sci transfer.

129
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,000
I sort of asked around campus.

130
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,400
You did?

131
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,800
Yeah, you've prob'ly already
got a stalker, huh?

132
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,600
No.

133
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,200
Hey, you ever heard of a Cafe Lunizia?

134
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,200
The Italian?

135
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,200
They got New York
style pizza...

136
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,600
Make you feel at home.

137
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,600
You askin' me out?

138
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,600
Yeah.

139
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,200
Definitely.

140
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,400
Hey, Spanky, let's go! Look
forward to kickin' your puck ass.

141
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,800
It's...
it's my ride.

142
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,800
Your name's "Spanky?"

143
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,800
No, Puck Ass...

144
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,600
No, people just call
me Luke.

145
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,600
We're beatin' his frat
boy team in ass hockey.

146
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,200
You know, pisses 'em off.

147
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,800
Look, I'll talk to Max...
to just replace the gasket, okay?

148
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:37,700
Thanks.

149
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,400
Wait...
So, uh,...

150
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,600
what do you think?

151
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,600
I'll just sit there
I won't to talk.

152
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,800
Yeah, look, uhm...

153
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,100
I just split up with this
total amoeba, so...

154
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,000
Oh, but I'm a paramecium....

155
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,400
You know,
that's way more evolved.

156
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,400
Maybe I'll give you a call
when your truck's ready.

157
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,500
Great.

158
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,600
You mean to go out, right?

159
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,000
Yeah.

160
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,800
Wow!

161
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,600
That was her!

162
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,360
Yeah. I know.

163
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,800
Jesus, man, you're
sweatin' like crazy.

164
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,900
I'm such a moron.

165
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,100
No, you're not.

166
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,600
No, yeah, I am.

167
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,400
I have incontrovertible proof.

168
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,741
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

169
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:57,400
You know, I wish just about my leg on a table,
too, I'm so glad that you did the first.

170
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,400
It's a hawk.

171
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,800
See, you're smirking!

172
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,900
No, it's just...

173
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,400
And it's green.

174
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,700
Ok? That's the one color
tattoo they can't remove!

175
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,100
Oh, really?

176
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,700
Bummer...

177
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,200
It's okay. I'm considering
a prosthetic foot.

178
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,000
I caught him with my best friend.

179
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,200
Former.

180
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,200
Such a cliché.

181
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,400
I'm sorry.

182
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,600
Winthrop Hawkins.

183
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,400
"Hawk".

184
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,600
Like...

185
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,200
...from
this Park Avenue family.

186
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,400
He'd know what kind of mushrooms
those are, what the best wine is.

187
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,400
The best wine is beer.

188
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,600
What's the matter?

189
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,000
Oh...Nothing.

190
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,200
Maybe just...little hot
out here.

191
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,200
I don't know.

192
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,500
You want moron?

193
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,200
I got a story.

194
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,900
When my dad died...

195
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:17,700
I'm sorry.

196
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,200
No, it's okay.
I was nine, so...

197
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,600
I barely knew what was goin' on.

198
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,800
But I do remember that...

199
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,600
...the grave still
really really sad, you know.

200
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:37,800
So I painted all kind of fish
and smiley faces all over it.

201
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,600
That's sweet.

202
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,800
Yeah. I'm sure my dad
would've loved that.

203
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,000
You're great, you know?

204
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,400
Would you excuse me, just one second? Please.

205
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,400
Thank you.

206
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:24,400
What's going on, man? You're
pick for "Golden globe" this weekend?

207
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,400
Everyone should just mind
their own fucking business!

208
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,200
Didn't go so great, huh?

209
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,600
Oh, I don't know, Keenan.

210
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,600
It was goin' great, man.

211
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,800
She's amazing. She's...

212
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,400
She's so smart.

213
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,000
Funny.

214
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:07,000
When she's travelling
on her spoon...like "ah".

215
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,000
Cool.

216
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,400
But...

217
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,600
Then I started gettin' that...

218
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,000
I gotta weird feeling again.

219
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,600
I think I know what's going on, okay?

220
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,800
"Acute adolescent anxiety".

221
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:32,400
It's from the stress of college,
girls, grades. It's really common.

222
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,400
I'm not adolescent, okay?

223
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,300
Where'd you
get this crap?

224
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,400
The net.

225
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,200
Oh, the net?

226
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,200
Yes, the net.
Just hear me out, okay?

227
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:46,500
I gotta all the symptoms like right off the bad:
panic attacks, localized alopecia, which is...

228
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,400
...that means...hair loss.

229
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,200
I wrote this doctor.

230
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:54,200
He wrote me back saying: "Is there any chance
that your friend Luke just lost his virginity?"

231
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,500
You gave him my name?

232
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,400
Look, he's from back East.

233
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:02,100
He's sending an information package
for you, man, I think you should read it.

234
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:06,000
I mean, Jesus, well, you got me thinking
like you're going bipolar on me or something.

235
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,400
Come on, Luke!

236
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,500
What am I suppose to think?

237
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,600
I came to apologize.

238
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,800
I had this pasta the other night...

239
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,000
"pasta quattro funghi", full mushrooms.

240
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,400
Anyway, it took me a
long time to realize...

241
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,200
...but I think somebody
put shrooms in it, all right?

242
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,000
Or somehow they got in there.

243
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,400
I was so hallucinating
and everything..

244
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,000
You know what amazes even me?

245
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:35,000
A guy's capacity to
be a world-class asshole.

246
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,000
Fortunately, I'm familiar
with the cause.

247
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,200
Will you just please
tell her I came by?

248
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,206
No, forget it. I'll catch up
with her on my own.

249
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,200
No. You won't.

250
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,600
Look...

251
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,600
I'm gonna see your sister if she'll see me.

252
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,100
I don't care the fuck
what you say about it.

253
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:49,700
Oh, really?

254
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,700
Yeah, really.

255
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,600
You go anywhere near her, I'll feed your
nuts to the neighbor's dog!

256
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:54,500
Oh, yeah?

257
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,400
What kind a' dog is it?

258
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,600
Huh?

259
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,700
I mean, is it a pitbull, or what?

260
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,200
I'm crazy about her.

261
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,800
Shrooms, huh?

262
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,600
I'll tell her you came by.

263
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:46,400
Had a sudden intense midnight
craving for a cherry popsicle.

264
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,600
Oh, okay.

265
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,500
You can find it in that freezer.

266
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,200
What a relief.

267
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,800
I'm Sydney. You?

268
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,900
Luke.

269
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,400
Hey, Luke.

270
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,200
Workin' late, huh?

271
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,000
Yeah.

272
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,600
Four AM.

273
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,100
It sucks.

274
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,900
Get out of here, when going to say that.

275
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:13,700
Say what?

276
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:17,600
Why you gotta say: "It sucks",
like it was a bad thing?

277
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,000
It's just a path peeve,
I mean...

278
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,900
every guy's just dying to get a
blow job, right? So...

279
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:28,300
you think they'd treat those words with
profound respect, like holy scripture.

280
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,800
For example...

281
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,200
"Unbelievable sunset, honey:
doesn't it just suck?", or

282
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:39,400
"You won an Olympic Gold
Medal, that blows!".

283
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,600
You got sure right, yeah.

284
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,600
Wow...

285
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,000
It must be great at your age, mhm?

286
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:56,400
That river of testosterone just coursing through
your veins, the damn about to burst!

287
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Hey.

288
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,800
What do you say...

289
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,800
...lock up the store and
try for our own Olympic Gold?

290
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,800
Uh...

291
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,600
No, thanks.

292
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,000
Jeez, lady.

293
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,400
Uh, I hate my hair.

294
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,400
I want to change the color,
what do you think?

295
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,400
Looks fine to me.

296
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,800
Your hair is such an incredible color.

297
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,600
It's blond.

298
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,600
I love it.

299
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,100
Hey, you think that I can just...

300
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,200
snip off a little piece?

301
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,800
Match the color?
It really..."sucks".

302
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,400
Oh, okay, now you're
just messing with me.

303
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,800
No, I'm not.

304
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,400
I really like it.

305
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,300
You should get rid
a' that thing, anyway.

306
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,300
I have clippers in my bag.

307
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,300
What thing?

308
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,600
Cowlick. Right here. See?

309
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,700
Aw..

310
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,700
What?

311
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,700
What are you doing?

312
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:59,400
What...you don't like
being touched?

313
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,400
No.

314
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,600
What's the matter?

315
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:10,400
Look, I'm sorry, but
you're just bizarre.

316
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,300
Maybe...

317
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,600
one thing I learned long ago,

318
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,800
you can't change your true nature,

319
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
even if it can change you.

320
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,200
Oh, great.

321
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,800
Gracias.

322
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,500
Man, a lady's eyeing you.

323
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,600
Oh, holy shit. It's that
lady from the store!

324
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,400
I think she's comin' over.

325
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,700
Hey, guys...

326
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,700
I'll buy you a drink?

327
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:17,300
Actually, we're here with
dates already. Thanks.

328
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,300
You are?

329
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,400
Who?

330
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,000
They're around.

331
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Luke, if you like this girl,
we got to talk.

332
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,600
What?

333
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,400
Anything happens since we spoke last.

334
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,200
Hot flashes? Pressure
in your chest?

335
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,800
Who are you?

336
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,200
Dr. Sydney Catchadourian.

337
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,800
Keenan, right?

338
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,200
Yeah.

339
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,500
You know him?

340
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,400
We exchanged E-mail.

341
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,300
Oh, you're the doctor?

342
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,500
From Savannah?

343
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,800
I came right away.

344
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,600
Why?

345
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,200
Your friend here...

346
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,800
...has an extra chromosome.

347
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:04,000
You're like some whack job, lady.
Stay away from here. Jeez!

348
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,200
I tested your hair.

349
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,000
Someone put mushrooms
in my mushroom sauce.

350
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,200
My advice...

351
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,600
...you got to keep him away from that girl.

352
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,400
He's a rock.

353
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,400
Can?

354
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,300
So, yeah.

355
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,200
You can trust him.

356
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,600
I hoped it was the same for Keenan.
I'm not used to rocks,

357
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,100
I'm used to pebbles.

358
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:36,400
Oh, please, grains of sand.

359
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Hello, ****

360
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,000
Thanks.

361
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,700
So everything's allright?

362
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:51,000
Yeah. Fine.. just a...beer.

363
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,200
You're right, man. The lady is nuts.

364
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,800
Let's play some pool?

365
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,200
You'd be checking at them all night...

366
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,800
You got a thing for him, or what?

367
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,200
Actually...

368
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,700
I'm hoping he's got one for me.

369
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,100
Your friends sorta'
like each other, uh?

370
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,000
Yep...Yeah.

371
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,400
They're like super-glue.

372
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,200
Thirty seconds together,
you can't pull 'em apart.

373
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
How'd they meet?

374
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,600
Keenan sold her a bike.

375
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:30,800
I don't think they've been apart
more than three hours since.

376
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,700
You know...

377
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,800
I never thought in a million
years you'd go out with me,

378
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,400
let alone twice.

379
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,400
Oh, man, you're not supposed to say that.

380
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,400
That's a total pathetic,
loser thing to say.

381
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:52,000
But that's okay. I'm gonna' take
it as a huge compliment.

382
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,100
Good.

383
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,100
Okay.

384
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,400
Two word answers only...

385
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,000
Why'd you ask me
out in the first place?

386
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,600
Okay, okay...

387
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,400
Beautiful.

388
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,700
Unpretentious. Very important.

389
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,600
Now, why'd
you say 'yes'?

390
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,800
Uhm..gentle,
sensitive...

391
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,600
Oh, sorry, okay...
Hot...Deep.

392
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,900
Is that better?

393
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,800
Yes. Hot, deep...
It's better.

394
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,800
Okay.

395
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,000
I got two words for you.

396
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:37,200
What're you most
passionate about?

397
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,500
Friendship.

398
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,200
And trust.

399
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,700
Those are good ones.

400
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,400
Yeah?

401
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,700
Yeah.

402
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,500
What about you?

403
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,000
Hockey.

404
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,500
Hockey.
Yeah.

405
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,400
So much for "deep".

406
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,000
You.

407
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:20,000
That girl is with...
You think he's serious about her?

408
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I'd give my left one to be with that girl.

409
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,700
Girls go first.

410
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,600
Okay, I'm gonna break this one wide open.

411
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,400
Right.

412
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,200
God!
Sorry!

413
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,300
What?

414
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,400
Oh, are you okay?

415
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,600
Yeah, I'm okay.

416
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,600
Man, I'd be on the floor cryin'
like a baby.

417
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,200
Yeah, right.

418
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,400
Would you excuse me a sec'?

419
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,200
Jesus, seems like precision got it missed.

420
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,200
Are you okay?

421
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,700
It's bad?

422
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,900
It's really bad?

423
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:12,800
I'll get some ice.

424
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,100
No! Wait!

425
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,100
What?

426
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:15,900
Keenan!

427
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:16,500
What?

428
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,000
Keenan!

429
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:17,600
What?

430
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,400
Look!

431
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,600
Oh my God!

432
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,200
Oh, MY GOD!

433
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,400
Oh, my God!

434
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,000
What did I tell you?

435
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:29,000
I told you to keep him away from that girl.

436
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Close the door.

437
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,400
You stay away from me, crazy bitch!

438
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,700
Luke, I'm gonna help you.

439
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,100
We're gonna get it back.

440
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,200
Now focus. Do you listen to me?

441
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,600
Good.
Drink this.

442
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,500
You don't want to give it back?

443
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,100
What is it?

444
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,400
Valium, Flexeril...
And a shitload of Darvon.

445
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,900
You gotta' calm down.

446
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,100
Calm down?

447
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,500
What the hell is wrong with him?

448
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,600
He's a zerophiliac.

449
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,700
A what?

450
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,600
He's the best stop,
I'm gettin' a doctor!

451
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,800
Oh, it's your lucky day,
I am a doctor!

452
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,800
You breathe one word of this,

453
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,800
...anyone else sees him like this and a medical turns...

454
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,000
he's fucked.

455
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:11,900
God, get out!?

456
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,400
Pictures all over the net,
tabloids, television!

457
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,200
Television?!

458
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,500
No! We're gonna' get it back!

459
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:21,800
You let me help him, he gets a
normal body, lives a normal life.

460
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,300
I mean, you his friend or not?

461
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:27,200
Wait a minute,
is it contagious?

462
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,500
There are no recorded incidents

463
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,800
Recorded incidents?

464
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:34,200
Oh, please God!
What did I do wrong?

465
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,200
Recorded incidents?

466
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,500
Oh my God,
I used his deodorant!

467
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,300
Oh, will you calm down?

468
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,200
Calm down?

469
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,000
Calm down?

470
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,400
Finally.

471
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:49,400
He's alright. He didn't go all
the way.

472
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:54,100
When you fall asleep or pass out,
a Z almost always reverts back.

473
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:56,500
It's called a Nocturnal
Remission.

474
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,700
Oh, relax, it's not contagious.

475
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,700
How many cases  are there?

476
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,200
In the world?

477
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,000
A hundred.
A thousand.

478
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,900
There's no way to know.

479
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,200
It doesn't show up in
any normal DNA test.

480
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:16,000
It's triggered when you
first have sex.

481
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,800
The woman in the RV!

482
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
From England.

483
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,000
Aha ...

484
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,400
Now, you're Morphescent
whenever you're aroused.

485
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:28,800
Wait...You tellin' me this is gonna happen
every time he gets the hots for a girl?

486
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,400
Man, this could be a problem.

487
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,800
I mean, is there a cure, or...?

488
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,200
It's not a disease!

489
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,800
But...there are
steps you can take.

490
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,000
What are the steps?

491
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,600
Before anything...

492
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,400
you have to try
going all the way.

493
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,800
Turn all the way into a female.

494
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,800
Ouch! You out of your mind?

495
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,500
Maybe we should get a second opinion.

496
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,600
Yeah, yeah, maybe we should!
'Cause you can forget that!

497
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:03,000
Guys, I warn you, they've never
seen anything like this before.

498
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:06,200
First they'll try to pumpin' full
of antipsychotic medications,

499
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,000
try surgery,

500
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,700
electroshock therapy...

501
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,000
God knows what else.

502
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,700
Okay, so look, say he does
try goin' all the way...

503
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:17,900
I'm just asking...

504
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,200
It ain't gonna' happen!

505
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:22,594
Oh, for Christ sake!
I'm trying to help you.

506
00:33:22,594 --> 00:33:24,800
That Z chromosome's
not latent anymore!

507
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,900
Look, if effects are
very differently...

508
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,100
you don't get
control a' that thing,

509
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,900
you don't know when
it's going to kick in,

510
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,100
what it's gonna' do it to you!

511
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:36,200
You want to end up with three left breasts,
behemoth hips and one testicle?

512
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,000
How would he even do that?
I mean, go all the way?

513
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,700
He's a Z.

514
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,200
You can go all the way,
when you have an orgasm.

515
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,400
Okay, uhm...
With who?

516
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,200
Let me check my calendar.

517
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,400
Well, you're not my type either.

518
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:03,600
Truth is, at this stage,
you don't really need anybody else.

519
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,200
So...how do I do it?

520
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,200
Luke...

521
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,900
It's a lot to absorb, I know.

522
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,900
You're going not to tell
anybody about this.

523
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,500
Not even Janine, man.
I'm serious.

524
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,600
I swear to God.
I don't say a word.

525
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,200
I'm not doin' it.

526
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:44,000
I don't give a shit what she says!
I can control this.

527
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:46,216
How?

528
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,000
Well...

529
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,134
I didn't know what was goin' on before.

530
00:34:51,134 --> 00:34:55,375
Now I do, so, it's not
gonna' be a problem.

531
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,000
I just need
to stay focused!

532
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,600
Good shot!

533
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:05,600
So you mean to tell me, you can try
keep yourself from getting turned on?

534
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:06,800
Yeah.

535
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:09,400
Come on, Luke, you get turned on
by two scoops of ice creams.

536
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:14,600
No, I'm just sayin'. You think Larissa,
the horse-faced girl's got her good points.

537
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,700
Hey!

538
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,200
Hope we'd find you here.

539
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,200
Hey.

540
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,600
We just wanted to know
if you're alright after...

541
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,800
last night.

542
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:30,900
Yeah.

543
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,500
Yeah, I'm good.

544
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,000
Good.

545
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,500
Good.

546
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:42,000
I had a really good time last night.

547
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,600
Yeah...
me too.

548
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:50,200
Will you excuse me for just one second?

549
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,000
What is goin' on?

550
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,200
Nothing.

551
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:06,200
We got a big game tomorrow.

552
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:09,900
Sometimes guys just need to hang with the
guys, you know? No distractions?

553
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:12,000
What the hell are you talking about?

554
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:20,600
Come on, Michelle, let the
boys play with their pucks.

555
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,400
You told her?

556
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,700
Dude, I had to.

557
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,700
You know Janine.

558
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,200
I've read about this. But it's go real,

559
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:30,700
it's so cool!

560
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,300
It's just disgusting!

561
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,900
How can you say that?

562
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,400
I'm seriously, Keen, wouldn't you love
to see what is inside a girl's body?

563
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,200
Uf, don't even go there!

564
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:43,200
Okay, fine.
You're guys.

565
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,400
But still...

566
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:47,500
isn't it every guy's fancy to have a pair
of boobs to play with anytime he wants?

567
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,900
Not my own!

568
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:51,300
God, man, how could you tell her?

569
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,700
She should be here.
Come on, man, it's just weird,

570
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,000
two guys hangin' out,
one turnin' into a girl....

571
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:58,600
I can't wait. I mean, it's not something
you get to see every day.

572
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,800
No!
Forget it!

573
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,800
Forget it, man.

574
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,800
What, he gets to, and I don't!

575
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,400
No one gets to!

576
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,000
Should we put on some
soft music, or something?

577
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,700
Do you want a magazine in there, buddy?

578
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,000
<i>Shut up!</i>

579
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,600
Anything?

580
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,000
No.

581
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,300
Hey, you wanna a beer in there?

582
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,400
<i>No!</i>

583
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,600
If I had a chance to be a
guy for a day, I'd jump at it.

584
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,400
Wouldn't you?

585
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,900
I AM a guy.

586
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,400
<i>It's like instinct evolution.</i>

587
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
<i>I'm feeling it...</i>

588
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,200
Yeah.

589
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Oh God!

590
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,300
<i>Hey Luke, are you alright?</i>

591
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,000
Oh, yeah.

592
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,400
Oh, my God.

593
00:38:58,700 --> 00:38:59,700
Wow.

594
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,800
Dude...

595
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Wow.

596
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,800
Dude.

597
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,800
Oh God, look at me?

598
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,200
What?

599
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,600
What?

600
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:32,000
I just wanna get one
thing straight, man...

601
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,200
There isn't no way I'm
sleeping with you.

602
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,700
- Man, even as a joke...
- That's just sick!

603
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,400
...maybe I will.

604
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,500
What? I thought you like the idea of
you're looking into watchin' two girls?

605
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,700
This is weird. This is
freaking me out.

606
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,900
Yeah. Maybe we should
call Dr. Catchadourian.

607
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,800
What for? I did it. Now,
I can switch back.

608
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,400
Get outta' here.

609
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,800
Already?

610
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:53,900
Yes.

611
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,600
Okay, yeah.

612
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,400
Would you stop starin'?

613
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,000
Janine.

614
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:45,400
It's like I can't get in
the right mood or something.

615
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,600
Welcome to my world.

616
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:52,200
Honey, in this
situation no one could.

617
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,800
You gotta' help. I need
to change right now!

618
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:57,000
You can't rush these things.

619
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:01,100
Yeah, you know. Some girls go half
their lives without even have one.

620
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:03,100
Okay, Studly, what do you suggest?

621
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,200
She likes it when I tell her stuff.

622
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:07,600
Like what?

623
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:12,400
Like: "You're so beautiful,"
"I love your smile,"

624
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,800
And..."The English Patient
was my favorite movie too".

625
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,600
What?

626
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,400
Hey.

627
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:33,400
Have a trouble, uh?

628
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,600
Yeah.

629
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,800
Well, maybe you should just to know.

630
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,800
Hang out for a while,
try later something.

631
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
No.

632
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,200
I gotta change right this minute.

633
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,400
Why?

634
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:49,700
I just do.

635
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:57,200
What're they like?

636
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,400
I don't know.

637
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:01,200
The same, I guess.

638
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,600
But it's not me.

639
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,800
I gotta change right now.

640
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,300
Well,

641
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,700
Janine has an idea that might help, but...

642
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,400
What is it?

643
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,400
She had to go pick it up.

644
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:20,000
She'd be right back, though, so...

645
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:36,200
Who's that?

646
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,800
I ordered more pizza,
figured you'll want some, you know after....

647
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,400
it.

648
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:45,700
Can I help you?

649
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,400
Actually I was lookin' for Luke.

650
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:48,700
Hey, man.

651
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,500
Hey, Keenan.

652
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,800
Luke's not here right now.

653
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Thank God. I'm starving!

654
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,000
How ya' doin'?

655
00:42:58,300 --> 00:42:59,600
I'm Max.

656
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:00,900
You live here too?

657
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
She's just visiting.

658
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:03,400
She's Luke's cousin.

659
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:04,800
Luca.

660
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,200
Luca?

661
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,200
Luca?

662
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,600
Luca, I always thought
that was a guy's name.

663
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,600
Italian or something?

664
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,800
Yeah, I'm part Italian.

665
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,000
Cool. Me too.

666
00:43:25,212 --> 00:43:28,147
"Vorrei mostrare la torre pendente di Pisa."

667
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,600
What is that mean?

668
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:36,100
How long you in town for?

669
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,300
Just a few weeks.

670
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:37,900
Weeks?

671
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:38,700
Days.

672
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,300
No, I'm leaving today! Now!

673
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,600
Just  leave that.
Is there anything you want me to tell Luke?

674
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:47,200
Actually I'm...
I'm way into hockey.

675
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,200
I was hopin' Luke could
show me the ropes.

676
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,800
See if is as good as he says he is.

677
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,600
Yeah, he's alright.

678
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,100
You play?

679
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,300
Yeah.

680
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,400
And you're good?

681
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:58,500
Yeah.

682
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,600
She's gotta' pack. You got to go.

683
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:05,200
Now.

684
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,800
Really nice meeting you.

685
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:10,700
Really.

686
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,200
What's the matter?

687
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,800
What is it,
what's the matter?

688
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:42,300
I got to change back. Right now!

689
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:44,000
Hey, what's the big deal?

690
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,200
Get out of here!

691
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:47,300
Just get out!

692
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:48,800
Okay.

693
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,000
What's going on?

694
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:57,400
Does he needs any help in there, or something?

695
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,600
Not from you.

696
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:07,600
I'm just sayin', he's not that
experienced with girls.

697
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,600
Oh, and you are?

698
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:14,200
I'm startin' to wonder if you are.

699
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,600
I'm not gonna' feed your fantasies.

700
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:27,400
Luca.

701
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:29,000
Would you stop calling me that?

702
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:31,000
Listen...

703
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:34,000
You gotta' just think about
whatever turns you on.

704
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:36,400
No matter
what it is.

705
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,000
Do you mind?

706
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:41,400
Touchy.

707
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,400
<i>All right, all right, all right...</i>

708
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:49,200
<i>Okay.</i>

709
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,000
<i>I have an idea.</i>

710
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:56,200
<i>Pretend that you're thrown
against the bed on your back,</i>

711
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:00,600
Your hands and your feet,
are tight to bedpost

712
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,400
You can't move anything,
not even an inch!

713
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,400
And then, suddenly,

714
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:11,400
you feel two, firm hands

715
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,200
on your thighs.

716
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,000
They're moving...

717
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:18,800
they're working away slowly...

718
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,400
firmly..

719
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:22,200
making their way up to your breasts.

720
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:23,700
Ah, baby!

721
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:24,800
Keenan!

722
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:27,200
Every time I look at you, I
get the shivers!

723
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,200
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

724
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:33,400
I want to take your fucked clothes off,

725
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:37,400
and throw you down...

726
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,900
I just want to envelop every inch of you.

727
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,800
Oh Keenan...

728
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,288
that beautiful curve along
your side.

729
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,600
I should to pin your arms
above your head,

730
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:56,000
and make mad, passionate...Love you!
- Oh, my God!

731
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

732
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
You're a screamer!

733
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,400
What are we doing here?

734
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:34,000
I didn't want anybody to see.

735
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:38,000
So I do what you said.

736
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:40,000
Oh, yeah?

737
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,000
And was it?

738
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,400
It was weird.

739
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:49,600
It was awful.

740
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:51,900
It was difficult making the switch?

741
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:53,800
It was difficult gettin' back.

742
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:57,200
Swear, you need an owner's manual for that thing.

743
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:01,200
Yeah, well. A lot of guys
could use one of those.

744
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:05,600
So, what do I do, now?

745
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Do I take some pills
or something?

746
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:09,400
Not exactly.

747
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:13,100
Okay.

748
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,300
This is gonna sound weird, but...

749
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:18,000
...I need to know if you're attractive to me.

750
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,600
What? No.

751
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:24,639
Not at all? Not even a little bit?
Are you gay?

752
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:26,600
No, Jeez...

753
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:27,700
Okay, calm down.

754
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:29,600
I'm just not attracted to you like that.

755
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:31,600
I got the message.

756
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:34,400
Listen to me.

757
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:36,200
Right now,

758
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,100
you can change either way anytime you want.

759
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:40,700
It's a very special and
critical time for a "Z",

760
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:43,800
something you'll only could
experience once in your life.

761
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:45,400
Good.

762
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,561
You have to use this incredible
opportunity you've been given,

763
00:48:51,561 --> 00:48:53,600
to figure out what you've supposed to be.

764
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:56,600
What...what is that mean?

765
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,600
You got to choose.

766
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,600
I don't want to choose.
I wanna be a guy.

767
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:09,900
Yeah, well the thing is sometimes your
desires can conflict with our desires.

768
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:12,800
I did what you said, now
tell me how to make it stop!

769
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,900
If the truth is you wanna stay
a guy, then great, but if not...

770
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:17,600
Hey, don't even say that!

771
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:21,200
Well, obviously some part
of you feels differently.

772
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:24,500
You couldn't change
if you didn't want to.

773
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:29,800
That is...crap!
That is crazy!

774
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Yeah?

775
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:33,300
That's the thing about the truth.

776
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:35,600
It'll set you free,

777
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:38,300
but first it can really piss you off.

778
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,400
This is nuts!
I'm supposed to be a guy!

779
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,800
So what's the problem?
You are one.

780
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,700
Well, you're not gonna help?

781
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:49,400
Yes, as soon as you're
ready to try again.

782
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:51,600
No, no way!

783
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:41,500
Wow !

784
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:50,700
Wow ...
Yeah!

785
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:52,600
Go Luke!

786
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:56,000
Well, ain't we a basket
of biscuits, boys?

787
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:57,500
Yeah, Luke, what
got into you today?

788
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:58,871
The Force.

789
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:06,500
Hey. Good game.

790
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:07,900
Yeah.

791
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,200
I stopped by your house the other day. I was
wondering if you could show me few pointers.

792
00:51:11,549 --> 00:51:12,032
Me?

793
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,300
Yeah. You're awesome out there.

794
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:17,400
And according to my sister,
you walk on water.

795
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:20,600
I don't know, man.

796
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:23,400
You see, the truth is, I uh...

797
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:26,200
I met your cousin the
other day. Luca.

798
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:27,900
Oh, yeah?

799
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,900
Yeah. You both have
practically the same name.

800
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,400
We were both named
after our Uncle Locasto.

801
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:34,300
Well, she's cool.

802
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:36,000
Actually, she's hot.

803
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:37,800
Maybe you could
hook up.

804
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:40,000
No. Not a chance.

805
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:41,400
Has she a boyfriend?

806
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:44,400
No, man.
She's my cousin, okay?

807
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:47,300
Yeah, and Michelle's my sister. But you
tell me you wouldn't like to do her?

808
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:48,300
Fuck you, man!

809
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:49,800
What is your deal?

810
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:54,800
What is going on?

811
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:55,700
Guys...

812
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:57,200
Hey, hey, hey...

813
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:59,900
Keep the fuck away from me!
And my sister!

814
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,700
You can fuck off!

815
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,100
Hey, it's cool, it's cool...

816
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:06,500
Luke's datin' his sister.

817
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Fuck you guys!

818
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,600
This shirt? I've had it for years.

819
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:26,200
Well, it's very sexy.
I love men's clothes.

820
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:27,500
Really?

821
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,600
What else have you
got in your closet?

822
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:34,900
Hey...

823
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,700
Hey! Keen rides behind me.

824
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:38,200
Cool.

825
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:40,800
So, what is all about?

826
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,200
Did you see that?
He's a hottie.

827
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:44,800
He is a brought damn.

828
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:49,700
Yeah, but...
I don't think he's your type.

829
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:52,600
Uh, ...we'll see about that.

830
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,800
No, I mean I think he's secretly
attracted to the guys.

831
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:58,400
I'm counting on it.

832
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:02,800
Okay guys.
We have to talk.

833
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,200
Is Luke alright?

834
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:05,300
I don't know what's up with him.

835
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:08,000
He's gonna be really confused about something.

836
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:10,400
The only thing I
can think of...

837
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,400
Hey, thanks buddy.

838
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:14,500
Thanks.

839
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,600
When Luke became Luca,

840
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:19,400
was he attracted to one of you?

841
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:22,800
No. Not me.

842
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:25,100
Well, he sure as hell
wasn't attracted to me.

843
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:26,700
Yeah. Definitely not.

844
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:28,200
May I have sugar?

845
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Wasn't it just the two of you?

846
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:33,400
Yeah.

847
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:36,200
No...exactly...

848
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:40,300
Oh, give me a break! Max?

849
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:42,100
No way!

850
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:44,800
They just had a huge fight.
He tried to beat the crap out of him!

851
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,200
Oh, Christ!

852
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:51,200
Luke's not queer! He was just...

853
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:53,000
He was just turnin' into a girl!

854
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:54,600
Exactly.

855
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,800
He turnin' into a girl!

856
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Incorrect assessment.

857
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:00,400
Would you rather she
was attracted to me?

858
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:01,500
Would you?

859
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:02,400
Maybe I would!

860
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:03,500
Oh, I just beg you...

861
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:05,200
Whoa! He regrets, saddle down!

862
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:08,000
Luke needs your help.

863
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:11,100
So, what's all this mean?

864
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:13,500
Maybe Luca

865
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:16,500
really likes this boy,

866
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:19,400
enough to wanna be female.

867
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:24,400
Don't sneer!

868
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,500
Oh, come on!

869
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,200
I know the guy.
We've done all kinds a' shit together.

870
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:30,200
Hoops, hockey...

871
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:31,900
No, girls can't play sports!

872
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,900
Oh, whatever! Christ, Janine!

873
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,100
Why the hell would he
wanna be a girl for, anyway?

874
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:37,800
God, God...
forbid!

875
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:40,200
Yeah, yeah. It's a little bit
hard for me to believe.

876
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,300
Oh, listen to me.

877
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:45,400
I know what I'm talking about.
I'm the expert, remember?

878
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:46,800
Look at this.

879
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:48,600
Who's he? An Ex?

880
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:52,600
Ex me.

881
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:56,000
You're one too?

882
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:58,000
You're a Z?

883
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:00,200
You're a guy?

884
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:02,600
Was.

885
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:04,700
I screwed up.

886
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:07,000
When you finally...

887
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:08,800
... figure out who you are,

888
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,400
it's a horrible thing
not being yourself.

889
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,200
That's why it's
crucial we help Luke.

890
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:17,500
Hey, you musta' worked out.

891
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,000
What is your batch?

892
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,000
So, you're one too?

893
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:32,400
Why didn't you tell me?

894
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:39,200
I didn't wanna to confuse the issue.

895
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:42,500
I wouldn't change
unless I wanted to?

896
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:46,000
Maybe some part of you.

897
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:49,000
You think I don't really
wanna be a man?

898
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:51,500
I think for some

899
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:56,200
...making it stop is more important
than knowing who you are.

900
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:57,900
It was for me.

901
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:01,600
Maybe for me, too.

902
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:12,200
The key is to have sex with another "Z".

903
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:16,100
When two "Z" do it, you become
Adulmorphic and your gender locks.

904
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:17,800
Another "Z"?

905
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,400
Et voilà!

906
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:22,800
That's why I came all the way out here.

907
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:25,400
And why you keep tryin' to get me
in the sack?

908
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:28,600
I wanna just save you some distress, but...

909
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,100
you're not attracted to me...

910
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:36,000
and for it to work,
both of us have to be into it.

911
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:38,200
That won't be a problem.

912
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:40,400
Really?

913
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:43,300
Let's go naked.

914
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:46,200
Right now?

915
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:49,000
There's no time like the present.

916
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:51,700
I...

917
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:56,800
Okay...
Tomorrow night.

918
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:04,300
Hey Luke!

919
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:07,900
Hey.

920
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,600
How is goin'?

921
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:12,900
What's this all about?

922
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
It's just a little something we
thought you might want.

923
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:18,200
What is it?

924
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:20,200
Open it up.

925
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:21,300
What's up, Keenan?

926
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:22,600
What's goin' on, man?

927
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:24,200
Okay.

928
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:37,400
What the hell is this for?

929
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:40,400
Ha, I told her.
I told ya'. What a stupid ass idea!

930
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:41,500
Keen! Stop.

931
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:42,500
Listen...

932
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:46,000
We just want you to know,
that whatever you decide,...

933
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,400
it's okay with us.

934
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:50,100
Decide?

935
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:53,000
Wow ... what are you talking about?
No, it's not okay!

936
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:55,800
Get fuck that away from me!

937
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,900
Sorry, man. Think she wishes
everyone was female.

938
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:00,100
Hey, what's that supposed to mean?

939
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:03,400
What do you think you mean, Janine?
Christ, it means he doesn't want to be girl!

940
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:04,800
Like he'd have to think about that!

941
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,400
There millions of us
enjoy being female!

942
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:08,900
Well, that's bully for you!

943
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:12,900
No, I want to know!
What exactly is wrong with being a girl?

944
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,900
Nothing is wrong with being
a girl, okay? It's great.

945
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,000
It's fuckin' phenomenal,
if you happen to be one!

946
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:21,100
Maybe we should talk
like the other day?

947
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:22,800
That wasn't my choice, Janine!

948
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:24,900
I sure as hell didn't make you do it!

949
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:27,800
Oh, God, Janine, will you
just let us talk for a sec'?

950
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:30,800
What? Is this some kind of a guy thing?

951
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:32,800
Give me a fuckin' break!

952
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:37,200
Man, what was that?

953
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:38,800
Sorry, man. She made me do it.

954
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,200
Hey...

955
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:52,000
you do like bein'
a guy then, right?

956
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:53,600
Asshole!

957
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:55,600
Fair enough.

958
00:58:55,800 --> 00:59:00,600
Hey, you should thank me, brother.
The one she picked out was pink!

959
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:42,200
Hi.

960
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:46,000
Hey.

961
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,800
How you doin'?

962
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:53,200
I'm okay.

963
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:55,100
You?

964
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:58,000
I'm good.

965
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:01,400
You look nice.

966
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:03,000
Thanks.

967
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,200
I was hopin' you'd call.

968
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,400
Yeah...
I was going to.

969
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:17,200
Look, there's something I
need to talk to you about.

970
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:19,800
Did I do something wrong?

971
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:23,600
No, you didn't nothing.

972
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:28,200
It's more..just...

973
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:31,000
I have some stuff I've got to
sort out by myself.

974
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:33,800
Like what?

975
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:41,300
So, heard you and
Max really got into it?

976
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:42,600
Yeah.

977
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:46,000
I kind a' lost it.

978
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:48,400
He knows how to push buttons, huh?

979
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:52,800
I don't...
I don't know.

980
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,800
I mean, I was after a
game. I was all revved up.

981
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,400
He's actually a really nice guy.

982
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:05,000
I'm not sure he's too crazy
about me seein' his sister.

983
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:07,600
Did he scare you off?

984
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
No, he didn't "scare" me off.

985
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:15,000
What, his struttin' around,
thinkin' he's so bad ass,

986
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:17,500
with his shirt hangin' open half the time?

987
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:20,200
Luke, it's just an act.

988
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:24,559
He likes pretending he's Joe Cool. You know,
you always says you gotta' be whatever you want,

989
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:26,600
and fuck 'em if they
can't take a joke.

990
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,400
Well, he's a joke alright.

991
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,700
Look, I'm not sure this is gonna' work out.

992
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:36,800
No, wait Michelle...

993
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:38,800
What?

994
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:43,300
I can't do this.

995
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:47,400
I'm not sure you even know who you are.
Much less who I am.

996
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:48,800
What's that supposed to mean?

997
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:53,400
Well, if you think my brother's such a "joke,"
how much better could you think of me?

998
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:55,300
We're not that
different, you know?

999
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:57,200
Of course you are, he's a guy.

1000
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:59,200
And he's my best friend.

1001
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:02,400
If you don't like him,
you can't like me.

1002
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:32,800
You know, I always thought your dying was
the worst thing that ever happened to me.

1003
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:40,500
I mean, that happen to you,
more than it did to me.

1004
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:43,500
I mean, a lot more, really.

1005
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Her name is Michelle.

1006
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:53,900
And I really like her, dad.

1007
01:05:58,300 --> 01:05:59,300
Look...

1008
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:01,300
every day I wish you were around...

1009
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:03,800
But, if I tell you this...you just...

1010
01:06:04,100 --> 01:06:06,200
...stay dead, okay?

1011
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:13,800
And I'm gonna beat this thing.

1012
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:17,200
Okay?
No matter what it takes.

1013
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:21,200
Before I tell you, I just let you know that.

1014
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:23,000
Okay?

1015
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:32,400
I think I might be a Zerophiliac....

1016
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:50,600
Wow...

1017
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:55,500
You're about the last person
I expected to see here.

1018
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:08,400
Not bad.

1019
01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:13,400
I thought you were heading out of the town?

1020
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:18,000
I decided to stay for a while.

1021
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,600
Cool.

1022
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:28,400
Where did you learn speak Italian?

1023
01:07:29,700 --> 01:07:31,900
Just touristic stuff.

1024
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:36,500
"How much for the spaghetti bolognesi".
"How much for a room?"

1025
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:41,000
Have you been?

1026
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:43,600
Little Italy. In New York.

1027
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:47,500
Someday, though.

1028
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:51,400
Want to go with me?

1029
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:22,500
Look...

1030
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:26,600
this was a mistake.

1031
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:30,000
Yeah. Of course, I know.

1032
01:08:30,900 --> 01:08:32,700
Oh, Jesus...

1033
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:37,600
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come here.

1034
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:41,200
No, please.

1035
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:44,400
Please, don't.. don't tell me...
that you're "just visiting".

1036
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:46,600
That you "need to leave".

1037
01:08:49,900 --> 01:08:51,400
I'm the one who needs to leave.

1038
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,800
What the fuck is goin' on, man?

1039
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,500
You do wanna' be a girl?
You're into guys now?

1040
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:19,700
No.

1041
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:25,400
I just have to be sure, Keenan.

1042
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:28,400
You know, I am now.

1043
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:31,000
What about Michelle?

1044
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:37,800
It's sort of a Catch-22, you know?

1045
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:42,185
I make out with a girl,
I start turning into one.

1046
01:09:42,186 --> 01:09:43,861
You gotta' admit,
it's a little weird.

1047
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:51,300
Hey. Let's get outta' here.

1048
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:53,000
Can I give you a ride somewhere?

1049
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:55,000
Janine's?

1050
01:09:57,100 --> 01:09:59,300
No, why don't you go see her?

1051
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:02,400
Think you're more her type.

1052
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:13,800
I'll see ya' round.

1053
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,600
"See me around"?

1054
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:19,400
Yeah.

1055
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:22,200
Look, I'm gonna' find my own place, okay?

1056
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:26,200
This is gettin' too fuckin'
weird for me.

1057
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:30,000
I'm goin' to Dr. Catchadourian's
tonight.

1058
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:32,800
To make this stop, Keenan.

1059
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:30,000
I got to admit...

1060
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:33,200
I'm relief that you made your decision.

1061
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:36,600
I don't think I couldn't live with myself, if...

1062
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:39,400
...we'd just gone ahead
without you being certain.

1063
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:42,800
To womanhood!

1064
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:45,400
To manhood!

1065
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:49,600
So, ...how do we do this?

1066
01:11:49,900 --> 01:11:51,800
We just do it...

1067
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:56,200
And your gender locks and you can
just change everytime you want.

1068
01:11:57,800 --> 01:11:59,800
Do you like my dress?

1069
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,400
Yeah.
Yeah, sure.

1070
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:05,000
Looks great on you.

1071
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,800
Oh man, dresses...

1072
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:10,600
Even without everything else...

1073
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:13,400
...dresses are reason enough
right there to stay a guy.

1074
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
What's that for?

1075
01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:24,000
You never did it
with a Z before.

1076
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:27,000
Believe me, you need
to be tied down.

1077
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:28,100
Does it hurt?

1078
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:31,000
Trust me, I'm a doctor.

1079
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
When two Z's do it, the lateral

1080
01:12:46,557 --> 01:12:52,508
hypothalamus gets completely
overwhelmed,...

1081
01:12:52,543 --> 01:12:53,500
Oh, man...

1082
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,200
What's happening?

1083
01:12:55,300 --> 01:12:56,600
No! No!

1084
01:12:57,400 --> 01:13:00,000
Noooooo!!!

1085
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:07,200
Now, you look me in the eye and tell me
that wasn't the best sex you ever had.

1086
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,200
You're Adulmorphic now.

1087
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:14,200
The only way to switch is
to do it with another Z.

1088
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:19,600
Oh, for Christ sake. Being a woman
doesn't make you any less of a man!

1089
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:42,300
Shit.

1090
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:43,800
Where is she?

1091
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:49,200
Whoa. I guess I really didn't
think you were gonna' go this way.

1092
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:54,200
Okay. Whatever.

1093
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:00,400
Hang on a sec'...

1094
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:03,600
Look, I need to tell you something.

1095
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:11,800
Janine and I split up.

1096
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:14,000
Yeah.

1097
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:19,200
All I ever did was piss her off.

1098
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:22,800
I'm not sure she even wants a guy.

1099
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
I gotta' get her back, man.

1100
01:14:38,300 --> 01:14:41,800
Luca, I'm very sorry
about earlier,

1101
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,600
what I said.

1102
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,500
Oh, it's like...

1103
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:56,200
the whole world's blown apart, you know?

1104
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,400
Man, you havin'
tits now is just weird.

1105
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,400
Jeremy...

1106
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:06,800
Yeah.

1107
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:09,000
Are you wanna break?

1108
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:10,400
Yeah.

1109
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:13,700
You have the coolest shirts.

1110
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:16,500
I know you?

1111
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:18,400
Not entirely.

1112
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:20,400
Sidney.

1113
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,500
Brought you a beer.

1114
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,200
Janine said he's definitely there.

1115
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:26,900
Did she mention me?

1116
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,500
God, I'm so glad you
want to be a guy.

1117
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:31,400
You are absolutely sure, right?

1118
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:33,800
I mean, it is totally
cool either way.

1119
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:37,000
I just don't want you to
think I'm zerophobic, or somethin'.

1120
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,600
What do you think?

1121
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:43,400
I mean, if I weren't a hundred percent
sure which I'm supposed to be.

1122
01:15:43,700 --> 01:15:44,600
If you had to say.

1123
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:49,400
All I know is, every time you look
at Michelle, or think about her, you smile.

1124
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:50,800
What the hell else do
you need to know?

1125
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,800
It's not right. She should
be with a normal guy.

1126
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:56,600
Oh, what, you don't get
to be with anyone?

1127
01:15:56,700 --> 01:15:58,200
That why they call it "zerophilia"?

1128
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:02,000
She's not gonna' want some guy who thinks
maybe he's supposed to be a girl sometimes.

1129
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:03,900
How do you know? Did you ask her?

1130
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,700
No way I'm gonna' ask her that.

1131
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:07,100
Well, you have to.

1132
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:09,600
Where are your
nads, man?

1133
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:13,400
We'll get 'em back.

1134
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:29,400
Over here!

1135
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:32,200
Son of a bitch!

1136
01:16:33,900 --> 01:16:35,300
We're doin' it, right now!

1137
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:36,800
I can't. I'm sorry.

1138
01:16:36,900 --> 01:16:39,700
"I'm sorry"? Fuck you!
Fuck me! Now!

1139
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:41,200
It won't work.

1140
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:43,400
We're goin', right here.

1141
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,300
But I'm gay!

1142
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:47,100
So what?

1143
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:49,300
So we both need to be into it,
or nothing happens.

1144
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:50,800
Such bullshit.

1145
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:53,400
That's why I became a
woman in the first place.

1146
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:56,300
I couldn't handle it. Figured if I was
female, it was okay to like guys.

1147
01:16:56,100 --> 01:17:00,100
So you're tellin' me, 'cause you're straight as a girl and
I'm straight as a guy, we can screw and switch, but...

1148
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:02,300
'cause you're straight as a girl,
and I'm gay as a guy,

1149
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:03,200
even if we do it...

1150
01:17:03,300 --> 01:17:04,500
...I'm just screwed?

1151
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:07,600
Jeez. I need trigonometry to
figure this thing out.

1152
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:09,200
Maybe
you're 'bi'.

1153
01:17:09,300 --> 01:17:12,000
Trust me,
girls do nothing for me. Zilch!

1154
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:13,700
You, on the other hand...

1155
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:14,700
Dude, no.

1156
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:16,100
What am I gonna' do?

1157
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:18,000
Maybe he's lying.
I say, screw him anyway!

1158
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:18,600
Fine.

1159
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:19,200
Fine.

1160
01:17:19,300 --> 01:17:19,800
Fine!

1161
01:17:19,900 --> 01:17:21,200
Waste of time.

1162
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,200
Michelle.

1163
01:17:23,300 --> 01:17:24,100
Oh, man.

1164
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:25,700
It's not what you think.

1165
01:17:26,300 --> 01:17:27,300
What does she think?

1166
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:28,900
You're an asshole!

1167
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:37,600
Keenan, I just want you to know...

1168
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:41,500
Jeremy, please, I so profoundly
don't care if you're queer.

1169
01:17:41,900 --> 01:17:43,600
Trust me, around
here, that's nothin'!

1170
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,900
I don't believe this.
You slept with that guy?

1171
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:46,900
It's not what you think.

1172
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,200
Oh, please! What about Max?

1173
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:49,900
What about him?

1174
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,400
Don't you care about him at all?

1175
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:53,600
Not like that: I'm straight!
I'm attracted to you!

1176
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:54,800
Oh, who cares, you idiot!

1177
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:58,100
No. This'll sound crazy, but I'm
not who you think I am.

1178
01:17:58,200 --> 01:18:01,000
Oh, Christ, Luke, ...Luca:
I know who you are!

1179
01:18:01,700 --> 01:18:02,900
You know I'm a Zerophiliac?

1180
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:06,800
Yes! So you can just go fuck
yourself. Literally!

1181
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:08,100
Does Max know who I am?

1182
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:09,400
So what if he does?

1183
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:10,200
Do you?

1184
01:18:10,300 --> 01:18:11,500
He's a guy!

1185
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:12,500
And you're a girl!

1186
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:13,600
No, I'm not!

1187
01:18:14,900 --> 01:18:15,900
I'm not supposed to be!

1188
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:19,000
There's no supposed to be
anything, you just are!

1189
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:21,600
Is that what you think? No!

1190
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,100
I can't believe you
slept with him!

1191
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:26,200
He was a woman! I was tricked.
I didn't know that I'd switch.

1192
01:18:28,700 --> 01:18:30,000
You're gonna tell me he's a Z too?

1193
01:18:30,100 --> 01:18:31,100
Yes!

1194
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:32,800
Well, that's just perfect.

1195
01:18:32,900 --> 01:18:34,900
What, is there something in
the water around here?

1196
01:18:35,100 --> 01:18:36,900
She told me it would make it stop.

1197
01:18:37,100 --> 01:18:40,600
So what? Why's that
so important to you?

1198
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:43,300
There's no way this
was ever gonna work out.

1199
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:45,100
Because I'm a Zerophiliac.

1200
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:48,500
Because you can't stand
being one! Bye, Luca.

1201
01:18:48,900 --> 01:18:51,300
Luke.

1202
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:09,100
Michelle!

1203
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:10,600
What?

1204
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:14,200
Look... I know it's a lot to figure out,
but it's nothing to do with it.

1205
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:16,800
Sleeping with that guy...

1206
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:20,400
I promised myself I would never
be in this situation again. Swear it.

1207
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:22,300
But Luke is different.

1208
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:25,600
We all are.
Bye Janine.

1209
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:56,000
What's it like?
To really make love?

1210
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:06,400
The best part's
lyin' there afterwards.

1211
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:09,400
Really close,

1212
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
really far.

1213
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,200
Like goin' to the moon, maybe.

1214
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:22,200
Yeah. ...They should open
a pizza joint up there.

1215
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,800
What am I gonna' do?

1216
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:34,000
Maybe, uh...maybe being a
woman'll work out okay.

1217
01:20:35,900 --> 01:20:38,400
Like being an elevated
member of the male species.

1218
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
Elevated "member"?

1219
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:44,400
Jesus, Janine. I'm just saying...
maybe he'll learn to like it.

1220
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:46,200
And it's so hard to conceive!

1221
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:49,300
Shut up! What, you
want a written guarantee?

1222
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:52,800
You're so damn lucky!
You're into him, he's into you.

1223
01:20:53,100 --> 01:20:54,700
Super-glue!

1224
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:57,600
What the hell else do you need to know?

1225
01:21:01,100 --> 01:21:03,700
I think you're the female half of me.

1226
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,600
And you're the macho half of me.

1227
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:14,400
And I don't know what
half of who the hell I am.

1228
01:21:32,200 --> 01:21:34,200
So what are you gonna' do?

1229
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:38,200
I don't know.

1230
01:21:39,900 --> 01:21:43,800
I prefer being a
guy, but I'm a girl.

1231
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:48,800
I'm attracted to Max,
but I'm in love with Michelle.

1232
01:21:52,300 --> 01:21:55,000
It's like I'm supposed to be both.

1233
01:21:58,700 --> 01:22:01,200
Not too practical. But,
at least, now I know.

1234
01:23:32,900 --> 01:23:34,100
Hey!

1235
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:36,400
Hey.

1236
01:23:38,900 --> 01:23:42,600
I know she doesn't want to
speak to me right now. But, I'm...

1237
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:44,800
do you know where I can find her?

1238
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:48,200
New York. Left two days ago.

1239
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:50,600
Oh, man.

1240
01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:58,200
Are you staying here?

1241
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:01,200
Probably just 'til Friday.

1242
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
I wanted to...

1243
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:07,800
...apologize to her.

1244
01:24:08,100 --> 01:24:11,500
Uhm... I don't know.
Forget it.

1245
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:17,800
Obviously, nothing's gonna'
ever be with me and her,

1246
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:21,600
but I just...

1247
01:24:21,900 --> 01:24:25,200
...I want her to know, how much I...

1248
01:24:29,900 --> 01:24:33,400
and that I wasn't cheating on her,
that I was just trying to be a man for her.

1249
01:24:35,900 --> 01:24:38,200
She'd have a field day
with that one, huh?

1250
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:40,000
True.

1251
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:45,700
Anyway, if you see her will you
tell her that I'm sorry and that...

1252
01:24:45,900 --> 01:24:48,200
I wish her the best,

1253
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:50,400
...everything.

1254
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:55,800
Thanks.

1255
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
I'm sorry. To you too.

1256
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
For what?

1257
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:07,500
Mixed signals, I guess.

1258
01:25:15,300 --> 01:25:16,100
Ow! Son-of-a-bitch!

1259
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:18,000
Are you alright?

1260
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:20,400
I'm stepped on a nail.

1261
01:25:25,400 --> 01:25:27,500
So, how you're doing about it?

1262
01:25:34,100 --> 01:25:36,300
You definitely had me confused.

1263
01:25:39,500 --> 01:25:42,400
For whatever it's worth.
I think you're a pretty

1264
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:44,400
... hot guy.

1265
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:48,400
Thanks.

1266
01:25:50,900 --> 01:25:52,200
But you're not interested?

1267
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:54,400
I couldn't do
that to Michelle.

1268
01:26:00,500 --> 01:26:02,300
Too bad you're a moron.

1269
01:26:06,300 --> 01:26:08,300
Excuse me?

1270
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:14,000
I have incontrovertible proof.

1271
01:28:09,300 --> 01:28:10,100
Hey.

1272
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:11,200
Hey!

1273
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:14,100
Good morning.

1274
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:24,400
What's up?

1275
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:29,800
You still think I'm going to bolt.

1276
01:28:30,200 --> 01:28:32,400
And leave me stuck.

1277
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:36,900
What do you want, a gender prenuptial?

1278
01:28:37,200 --> 01:28:38,600
Maybe.

1279
01:28:46,900 --> 01:28:48,500
I have to go to work.

1280
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:52,200
No.

1281
01:28:52,700 --> 01:28:55,900
Only place I'm going is back to sleep.

1282
01:28:56,100 --> 01:28:59,000
No. I can't show up at work like this.

1283
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
Oh, yeah.
