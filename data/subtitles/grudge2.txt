The time is now 12:27 A.M.
This is J-Line Midnight Angle, deejayed in the late Saturday by Hideshima Fumika.
Our theme of the day is the Winter Sea.
I went to to check out the sea
in Okinawa recently.
Winter seashore is very lonely.
It was beyond my expectations.
However, at the Aquarium...
What?
What the...
Never mind.
Turn it off, will you?
It's so creepy.
Paranormal Phenomenon, perhaps?
Masashi, do you have to talk nonsense, too?
Why are you so grouchy today?
Anything wrong with you?
Nothing.
What kind of role was it today?
How can you call it a role?
I was a guest at Paranormal TV Show.
I was introduced as a Queen of Horror.
Since when I became a Queen of Horror?
There are many jobless actors in the same Agency, right?
You once told me, didn't you?
My mother watches all shows you appear every day.
She does?
Yeah.
Because she loves the fact that her son's fiancée appears on TV shows and movies.

Hey...
About our baby...
Have you already told the Agency?
You can't hide it for long, can you?
Besides, our wedding date has already been set.
I know it!
I'm sorry but...
I...
What was that?!
I might have hit something.
eh?!
It's a cat.
ehh!
Let's get the hell out of here.
eh... but...
It just came out of nowhere.
Masashi!
Nooooooo!

I'm very sorry.
Your baby, too...
I'm sorry...
I'm very sorry...

I am sorry.

Harase Residence
It's so cold today.
I bet you are tired now.
You should sleep after drinking this.
Mother?
Yes?
Don't I have any siblings?
What?
Such as a boy who died young?
A boy?
What happened all of a sudden?
I have only one daughter, Kyoko.
Is that so?
My family has been blessed with girls.
So your child must have been...
... a girl.
No.
My baby must have been...
... a boy, I'm sure.
Pretty flowers...
Kyoko-san, thank you.
Will he ever really wake up?
Where did the doctor go?
eh?! Gone to such a place?!
Doctor?
Who?
It's all your fault.
Ahhhhhhh!
Nooo!
Cut!
OK.
You scared the hell out of me.
Who the hell are you?!
Is there a scream in the script?!
Hey, you're an extra in the movie.
You mustn't do things
you're not ordered to do.
We take a break right now!

What is it?
Wait a moment...
What is it?
Have you heard about this coming Special?
Special? You mean Keisuke-san's program?
Yes. That's the one.
You are in it, too, Megu-chan?
Yes.
I'm kind of a regular guest in that series.
I'm kind of bored already.
Speaking of which, do you know who the main guest is?
Guest?
If I remember it correctly,
She is an actress...
and her name is...
Harase Kyoko.
You mean Harase Kyoko, a Queen of Horror?
That's right.
Megu-chan, you are a horror movie freak.
Hi, Tomo-chan!
Ah!
Good morning.
Morning.
Here it is.
Where is it, this time?
I found the famous Haunted House in Nerima.
It's an old house.
Some dwellers have actually died there.
Paranormal Special! The Truth
of the Cursed House Mysterious Death Case!
I won't do the same act any more.
eh?
What? What is it?
Yes, you did the Ghost.
That was great.
So you did the Ghost, Megu-chan?
I was forced to act Ghost.
Did you hear the viewer ratings at that time?
It was over 25%.
Over 25%.
Thereafter, people called me
a Ghost for long time.
Because you look like a Ghost.
What do you mean by that?!
Sorry. I'm counting on you!
Wait!
I won't do that! You hear?!
Idiot!
Nori-kun, You are already here?
Why you make the room so dark?
Hey!
Nori-kun...
Hey! Tomoka!
It's me!
Why don't you open the door for me?
Here comes Nori-kun!
What's up?
What's up?
Hey, there is no banging at all.
Disalignment of the walls and pillars are making noise, I'm sure.
You worry too much.
Wait for a while.
Usually, it starts after 12:30 A.M.
eh?
What time is it? Tomo-chan? Tomo-chan?
Be quite! OK?
Where is it? Just around here?
Stop it, Nori-kun.
See...
Did you hear?
You heard that, right?
What's the hell is this?
Time is twelve...
... Twenty Seven.
This is the corner room, isn't it?
Yes.
There is a hidden reason for this.
Why it is called the Haunted House...
... is buried under the history.
Kyoko-san, this is merely the tip of the iceberg.
There is a reason why it is called the Haunted House.
What is it?
I'm sorry.
In fact,
Well...
I'm sorry.
Actually, this house is
A family moved in this house after that event...
After the beep, record your message and Press # when you are done.
Hello! This is Noritaka speaking.

Why don't you answer me?
You still mind that so much.
Hello?

MEGUMI
Kyoko-san, I'm sorry to have kept you waiting so long.
Thank you.
I watch all the movies you are in, Kyoko-san.
eh?! Do you really?
Thank you.
That one was scary.
What's that movie...
The one... an old lady in the closet...
Cursed Fusuma Screen?
Yes, that's the one!
I watched it, too.
That one was really scary.
Really?
Thank you.
Kei-chan! We're all set.
We're coming down soon.
Thanks.
First, we shoot "When you enter the house"
Basically our reporter will ask you questions.
Just give us your carefree comments.
Yes
A Queen of Horror challenges the real Haunted House.
That'll give a real booster to our show.
Challenge for what?
Is it true that the murder really took place here?
Yes.
There were reports in newspapers.
It is said the curse of the first victim triggered the chain events here.
Is this true?!
You always say that.
I'm sorry it took longer.
Thank you.
Shall we go downstairs?
Yes.
Hello, everyone, I am Miura Tomoka.
This time, we focus on one house,
where real murders took place.
That case had been reported on TV and newspapers some years ago.
The abnormality of the case had drawn people's attention.
First, it happened to the housewife living there
who was killed by her husband.
She was found dead in deplorable way.
Later, her husband died of unknown causes.
And their son's whereabouts is still unknown.
We are going into the house
where these events took place.
Now the house is in front of us.
The title is shown superimposed over Narration.
Resume now!
I feel an unexplainable atmosphere...
The house is over there.
Let us introduce our special guest today.
Casted in numerous horror movies.
Known as the Queen of Horror.
One and only Harase Kyoko-san
is our guest today.
Harase-san, how are you today?
Hello.
OK!
When you step in the house, Kyoko-san,
You will stop suddenly.
Show us the feeling
you are not feeling well.
Kyoko-san.
In fact, this house has more stories.
The real reason why it is called the Haunted House...
... is buried under the history.
What's that?
After the first event, the new family moved in eventually.
But they died just like chain reactions.
And some were still missing as of today.
Really?!
I heard some actresses have strong paranormal powers.
Kyoko-san, do you feel anything special?
eh?
Well... sort of...
Well...
The atmosphere of the house is...
Wow!
eh!
What was that?!
What is that?
Microphone is acting up.
The mic?
What's happening here?
I picked up a strange sound right now.
Sound?
It's from Harase-san's microphone.
Did you hear anything?
I didn't hear anything.
Isn't it the noise from the house?
No, I really heard it.
Just noise from somewhere, right?
Someone walked outside or something?
Anyhow, let's check it.
Cut! Cut!
eh?
You heard it right?
I told you, yes!
It may be your imagination.
I've never heard of any paranormal activities in these type of shows.
When a horror movie is produced,
a movie studio offers Oharai or purification?
Yes, most of the time.
Not just confined to the horror movies, though.
Is that so?
Although I was in many TV paranormal specials,
But I've never been in any Oharai or purification.
So this is your way of purification, isn't it?
Very cute!
Megumi-chan, you are easy to be scared, aren't you?
Wait a moment...
Omamori for Safe Birth
Amulet for Safe Delivery
I'll give it to Kyoko-san.
eh?
Why?
Kyoko-san, you are...
... pregnant, aren't you?
What?
But why?
I know these things.
I am a woman as well.
Is that so.
Please.
Thanks.
I am a little bit discouraged now.
I expected it would be much more scary.
Megumi, you sometimes see something, don't you?
Don't you feel anything about the house?
What's wrong with her?
Hey, Megumi!
You like these stuff, right?
Yeah, sort of.
It looks like you can do both.
Is that true?
How about you, Megu-chan?
What is it?
No just a rumor...
You pretend that you haven't heard it.
Many people died here.
Really?!
That one?
I noticed that just now.
It gives me goose pimples.
Yes.
It's so creapy, isn't it?
Hey! I just finished location work.
Where are you, right now?
Hello! Nori-kun!
Hello!
Hello.
Thank you for your work.
Thank you for your good work.
Sorry, will you hold it for a while, Sooma-san?
No problem.
I'm sorry.
What is it?
We are closing now.
Sorry, I forgot something.
I will be right back.
Hurry up, will you?
Yes, yes!
Kayako
Megumi, will you hurry up?
To: Tokunaga Katsuya-sama
You are so slow...
Did you find your thing?
Hey!
Hey, hey, hey!
Do you check video later?
Yes, I do.
You got to tell me if a ghost is in it.
Yeah, I heard you.
Did you really hear the sound, Sooma-chan?
Of course, I'm a pro.
Thank you for working today!
Pro, my ass.
We've never picked up anything before.
Thank you for your work!
The same to you!
I heard some actresses have strong paranormal powers.
Kyoko-san, do you feel anything special?
Yes.
Well...
The atmosphere of the house is...
Wow!
What was that?!
What is that?
Microphone is acting up.
The mic?
What's happening here?
I picked up a strange sound right now.
eh?!
It's Harase-san's microphone.
What did you hear?
Nothing is wrong here.
Someone walked outside or something?
Anyhow, let's check it.
Cut! Cut!
Ah!
Gyahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

What is it?
What is going on?!
Masashi
Masashi!
After that location work,
Kyoko was in a traffic accident.
I managed to stay alive with minor wounds.
After that, I lost contact with Tomo-chan, our reporter.
She was found in her apartment 2 days later.
She hung herself with her lover together.
What?!
According to police,
she died just after that location work.
In our station building, around the same time,
Megumi vanished with no trace.
Vanished?
There was her scream in the make-up room.
When I got there,
She was gone.
How can it be?
On top of these two...
We lost contact with Watanabe-san, our cameraman.
Sooma-chan, our recording staff.
Do you feel weird, too?
All the participants of that location work...
... one after another...
My mother passed away, too.
Suddenly on that day...
I'm sorry.
I don't want to be involved any more.
Wahhh!
Is that you, Megumi?
Is that...
Megumi-chan...
Why?
Megumi-chan!
Megumi!
Megumi-chan!
Megumi!
Megumi-chan!
Megumi!
Megumi-chan!
Megumi-chan!
Are you in here?
Megumi?
You are Megumi, aren't you?
Keisuke-san...
What is this?
Megumi left it there.
eh?
Diary?
I saw the same thing in that house.
What?
But why it's here?
So what's going on?
Will you come with me?
