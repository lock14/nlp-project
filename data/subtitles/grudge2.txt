<i>The time is now 12:27 A.M.</i>



<i>This is J-Line Midnight Angle, deejayed in the late Saturday by Hideshima Fumika.</i>



<i>Our theme of the day is the Winter Sea.</i>



<i>I went to to check out the sea
in Okinawa recently.</i>



<i>Winter seashore is very lonely.</i>



<i>It was beyond my expectations.</i>



<i>However, at the Aquarium...</i>



<i>What?</i>



<i>What the...</i>



<i>Never mind.</i>



<i>Turn it off, will you?</i>



<i>It's so creepy.</i>



<i>Paranormal Phenomenon, perhaps?</i>



<i>Masashi, do you have to talk nonsense, too?</i>



<i>Why are you so grouchy today?</i>



<i>Anything wrong with you?</i>



<i>Nothing.</i>



<i>What kind of role was it today?</i>



<i>How can you call it a role?</i>



<i>I was a guest at Paranormal TV Show.</i>



<i>I was introduced as a Queen of Horror.</i>



<i>Since when I became a Queen of Horror?</i>



<i>There are many jobless actors in the same Agency, right?</i>



<i>You once told me, didn't you?</i>



<i>My mother watches all shows you appear every day.</i>



<i>She does?</i>



<i>Yeah.</i>



<i>Because she loves the fact that her son's fiancée appears on TV shows and movies.</i>

<i>Hey...</i>



<i>About our baby...</i>



<i>Have you already told the Agency?</i>



<i>You can't hide it for long, can you?</i>



<i>Besides, our wedding date has already been set.</i>



<i>I know it!</i>



<i>I'm sorry but...</i>



<i>I...</i>



<i>What was that?!</i>



<i>I might have hit something.</i>



<i>eh?!</i>



<i>It's a cat.</i>



<i>ehh!</i>



<i>Let's get the hell out of here.</i>

<i>It just came out of nowhere.</i>

<i>Have you heard about this coming Special?</i>



<i>Special? You mean Keisuke-san's program?</i>



<i>Yes. That's the one.</i>



<i>You are in it, too, Megu-chan?</i>



<i>Yes.</i>



<i>I'm kind of a regular guest in that series.</i>



<i>I'm kind of bored already.</i>



<i>Speaking of which, do you know who the main guest is?</i>



<i>Guest?</i>



<i>If I remember it correctly,</i>



<i>She is an actress...</i>



<i>and her name is...</i>



<i>Harase Kyoko.</i>



<i>You mean Harase Kyoko, a Queen of Horror?</i>



<i>That's right.</i>



<i>Megu-chan, you are a horror movie freak.</i>



<i>Hi, Tomo-chan!</i>



<i>Ah!</i>



<i>Good morning.</i>



<i>Morning.</i>



<i>Here it is.</i>



<i>Where is it, this time?</i>



<i>I found the famous Haunted House in Nerima.</i>



<i>It's an old house.</i>



<i>Some dwellers have actually died there.</i>



<i>Paranormal Special! The Truth
of the Cursed House Mysterious Death Case!</i>



<i>I won't do the same act any more.</i>



<i>eh?</i>



<i>What? What is it?</i>



<i>Yes, you did the Ghost.</i>



<i>That was great.</i>



<i>So you did the Ghost, Megu-chan?</i>



<i>I was forced to act Ghost.</i>



<i>Did you hear the viewer ratings at that time?</i>



<i>It was over 25%.</i>



<i>Over 25%.</i>



<i>Thereafter, people called me
a Ghost for long time.</i>



<i>Because you look like a Ghost.</i>



<i>What do you mean by that?!</i>



<i>Sorry. I'm counting on you!</i>



<i>Wait!</i>



<i>I won't do that! You hear?!</i>



<i>Idiot!</i>



<i>Nori-kun, You are already here?</i>



<i>Why you make the room so dark?</i>



<i>Hey!</i>



<i>Nori-kun...</i>



<i>Hey! Tomoka!</i>



<i>It's me!</i>



<i>Why don't you open the door for me?</i>



<i>Here comes Nori-kun!</i>



<i>What's up?</i>



<i>What's up?</i>



<i>Hey, there is no banging at all.</i>



<i>Disalignment of the walls and pillars are making noise, I'm sure.</i>



<i>You worry too much.</i>



<i>Wait for a while.</i>



<i>Usually, it starts after 12:30 A.M.</i>



<i>eh?</i>



<i>What time is it? Tomo-chan? Tomo-chan?</i>



<i>Be quite! OK?</i>



<i>Where is it? Just around here?</i>



<i>Stop it, Nori-kun.</i>



<i>See...</i>



<i>Did you hear?</i>



<i>You heard that, right?</i>



<i>What's the hell is this?</i>



<i>Time is twelve...</i>



<i>... Twenty Seven.</i>



<i>This is the corner room, isn't it?</i>



<i>Yes.</i>



<i>There is a hidden reason for this.</i>



<i>Why it is called the Haunted House...</i>



<i>... is buried under the history.</i>



<i>Kyoko-san, this is merely the tip of the iceberg.</i>



<i>There is a reason why it is called the Haunted House.</i>



<i>What is it?</i>



<i>I'm sorry.</i>



<i>In fact,</i>



<i>Well...</i>



<i>I'm sorry.</i>



<i>Actually, this house is</i>

<i>Kyoko-san, I'm sorry to have kept you waiting so long.</i>



<i>Thank you.</i>



<i>I watch all the movies you are in, Kyoko-san.</i>



<i>eh?! Do you really?</i>



<i>Thank you.</i>



<i>That one was scary.</i>



<i>What's that movie...</i>



<i>The one... an old lady in the closet...</i>



<i>Cursed Fusuma Screen?</i>



<i>Yes, that's the one!</i>



<i>I watched it, too.</i>



<i>That one was really scary.</i>



<i>Really?</i>



<i>Thank you.</i>



<i>Kei-chan! We're all set.</i>



<i>We're coming down soon.</i>



<i>Thanks.</i>



<i>First, we shoot "When you enter the house"</i>



<i>Basically our reporter will ask you questions.</i>



<i>Just give us your carefree comments.</i>



<i>Yes</i>



<i>A Queen of Horror challenges the real Haunted House.</i>



<i>That'll give a real booster to our show.</i>



<i>Challenge for what?</i>



<i>Is it true that the murder really took place here?</i>



<i>Yes.</i>



<i>There were reports in newspapers.</i>



<i>It is said the curse of the first victim triggered the chain events here.</i>



<i>Is this true?!</i>



<i>You always say that.</i>



<i>I'm sorry it took longer.</i>



<i>Thank you.</i>



<i>Shall we go downstairs?</i>



<i>Yes.</i>



<i>Hello, everyone, I am Miura Tomoka.</i>



<i>This time, we focus on one house,</i>



<i>where real murders took place.</i>



<i>That case had been reported on TV and newspapers some years ago.</i>



<i>The abnormality of the case had drawn people's attention.</i>



<i>First, it happened to the housewife living there</i>



<i>who was killed by her husband.</i>



<i>She was found dead in deplorable way.</i>



<i>Later, her husband died of unknown causes.</i>



<i>And their son's whereabouts is still unknown.</i>



<i>We are going into the house</i>



<i>where these events took place.</i>



<i>Now the house is in front of us.</i>



<i>The title is shown superimposed over Narration.</i>



<i>Resume now!</i>



<i>I feel an unexplainable atmosphere...</i>



<i>The house is over there.</i>



<i>Let us introduce our special guest today.</i>



<i>Casted in numerous horror movies.</i>



<i>Known as the Queen of Horror.</i>



<i>One and only Harase Kyoko-san
is our guest today.</i>



<i>Harase-san, how are you today?</i>



<i>Hello.</i>



<i>OK!</i>



<i>When you step in the house, Kyoko-san,</i>



<i>You will stop suddenly.</i>



<i>Show us the feeling
you are not feeling well.</i>



<i>Kyoko-san.</i>



<i>In fact, this house has more stories.</i>



<i>The real reason why it is called the Haunted House...</i>



<i>... is buried under the history.</i>



<i>What's that?</i>



<i>After the first event, the new family moved in eventually.</i>



<i>But they died just like chain reactions.</i>



<i>And some were still missing as of today.</i>



<i>Really?!</i>



<i>I heard some actresses have strong paranormal powers.</i>



<i>Kyoko-san, do you feel anything special?</i>



<i>eh?</i>



<i>Well... sort of...</i>



<i>Well...</i>



<i>The atmosphere of the house is...</i>



<i>Wow!</i>



<i>eh!</i>



<i>What was that?!</i>



<i>What is that?</i>



<i>Microphone is acting up.</i>



<i>The mic?</i>



<i>What's happening here?</i>



<i>I picked up a strange sound right now.</i>



<i>Sound?</i>



<i>It's from Harase-san's microphone.</i>



<i>Did you hear anything?</i>



<i>I didn't hear anything.</i>



<i>Isn't it the noise from the house?</i>



<i>No, I really heard it.</i>



<i>Just noise from somewhere, right?</i>



<i>Someone walked outside or something?</i>



<i>Anyhow, let's check it.</i>



<i>Cut! Cut!</i>



<i>eh?</i>



<i>You heard it right?</i>



<i>I told you, yes!</i>



<i>It may be your imagination.</i>



<i>I've never heard of any paranormal activities in these type of shows.</i>



<i>When a horror movie is produced,</i>



<i>a movie studio offers Oharai or purification?</i>



<i>Yes, most of the time.</i>



<i>Not just confined to the horror movies, though.</i>



<i>Is that so?</i>



<i>Although I was in many TV paranormal specials,</i>



<i>But I've never been in any Oharai or purification.</i>



<i>So this is your way of purification, isn't it?</i>



<i>Very cute!</i>



<i>Megumi-chan, you are easy to be scared, aren't you?</i>



<i>Wait a moment...</i>



<i>Omamori for Safe Birth
Amulet for Safe Delivery</i>



<i>I'll give it to Kyoko-san.</i>



<i>eh?</i>



<i>Why?</i>



<i>Kyoko-san, you are...</i>



<i>... pregnant, aren't you?</i>



<i>What?</i>



<i>But why?</i>



<i>I know these things.</i>



<i>I am a woman as well.</i>



<i>Is that so.</i>



<i>Please.</i>



<i>Thanks.</i>



<i>I am a little bit discouraged now.</i>



<i>I expected it would be much more scary.</i>



<i>Megumi, you sometimes see something, don't you?</i>



<i>Don't you feel anything about the house?</i>



<i>What's wrong with her?</i>



<i>Hey, Megumi!</i>



<i>You like these stuff, right?</i>



<i>Yeah, sort of.</i>



<i>It looks like you can do both.</i>



<i>Is that true?</i>



<i>How about you, Megu-chan?</i>



<i>What is it?</i>



<i>No just a rumor...</i>



<i>You pretend that you haven't heard it.</i>



<i>Many people died here.</i>



<i>Really?!</i>



<i>That one?</i>



<i>I noticed that just now.</i>



<i>It gives me goose pimples.</i>



<i>Yes.</i>



<i>It's so creapy, isn't it?</i>



<i>Hey! I just finished location work.</i>



<i>Where are you, right now?</i>



<i>Hello! Nori-kun!</i>



<i>Hello!</i>



<i>Hello.</i>



<i>Thank you for your work.</i>



<i>Thank you for your good work.</i>



<i>Sorry, will you hold it for a while, Sooma-san?</i>



<i>No problem.</i>



<i>I'm sorry.</i>



<i>What is it?</i>



<i>We are closing now.</i>



<i>Sorry, I forgot something.</i>



<i>I will be right back.</i>



<i>Hurry up, will you?</i>



<i>Yes, yes!</i>



<i>Kayako</i>



<i>Megumi, will you hurry up?</i>



<i>To: Tokunaga Katsuya-sama</i>



<i>You are so slow...</i>



<i>Did you find your thing?</i>



<i>Hey!</i>



<i>Hey, hey, hey!</i>



<i>Do you check video later?</i>



<i>Yes, I do.</i>



<i>You got to tell me if a ghost is in it.</i>



<i>Yeah, I heard you.</i>



<i>Did you really hear the sound, Sooma-chan?</i>



<i>Of course, I'm a pro.</i>



<i>Thank you for working today!</i>



<i>Pro, my ass.</i>



<i>We've never picked up anything before.</i>



<i>Thank you for your work!</i>



<i>The same to you!</i>



<i>I heard some actresses have strong paranormal powers.</i>



<i>Kyoko-san, do you feel anything special?</i>



<i>Yes.</i>



<i>Well...</i>



<i>The atmosphere of the house is...</i>



<i>Wow!</i>



<i>What was that?!</i>



<i>What is that?</i>



<i>Microphone is acting up.</i>



<i>The mic?</i>



<i>What's happening here?</i>



<i>I picked up a strange sound right now.</i>



<i>eh?!</i>



<i>It's Harase-san's microphone.</i>



<i>What did you hear?</i>



<i>Nothing is wrong here.</i>



<i>Someone walked outside or something?</i>



<i>Anyhow, let's check it.</i>



<i>Cut! Cut!</i>



<i>Ah!</i>



<i>Gyahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!</i>

<i>After that location work,</i>



<i>Kyoko was in a traffic accident.</i>

<i>After that, I lost contact with Tomo-chan, our reporter.</i>



<i>She was found in her apartment 2 days later.</i>



<i>She hung herself with her lover together.</i>



<i>What?!</i>



<i>According to police,</i>



<i>she died just after that location work.</i>



<i>In our station building, around the same time,</i>



<i>Megumi vanished with no trace.</i>



<i>Vanished?</i>



<i>There was her scream in the make-up room.</i>



<i>When I got there,</i>



<i>She was gone.</i>



<i>How can it be?</i>



<i>On top of these two...</i>



<i>We lost contact with Watanabe-san, our cameraman.</i>



<i>Sooma-chan, our recording staff.</i>



<i>Do you feel weird, too?</i>



<i>All the participants of that location work...</i>



<i>... one after another...</i>



<i>My mother passed away, too.</i>



<i>Suddenly on that day...</i>



<i>I'm sorry.</i>



<i>I don't want to be involved any more.</i>
