00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Meet local girls from Snapchat on 
DMhookup.com

2
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,722
We should get this repaired.

3
00:03:56,009 --> 00:03:58,081
I'm going to bed. Good night.

4
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:01,447
I'll be up soon.

5
00:04:02,314 --> 00:04:04,485
Now, it gives me great pleasure
to welcome...

6
00:04:04,585 --> 00:04:07,935
our new deputy superintendent,
Dr. Max Raphael.

7
00:04:10,025 --> 00:04:13,823
And we also welcome his wife, Stella,
and their fine young fellow, Charlie.

8
00:04:15,466 --> 00:04:19,688
And we wish you many contented years
here, among the confined and confused.

9
00:04:20,554 --> 00:04:24,001
I refer, of course, to the present
company, not to the patients.

10
00:04:33,832 --> 00:04:35,261
Please forgive the latecomer.

11
00:04:35,367 --> 00:04:37,734
A rather delicate moment
with our new matricide.

12
00:04:37,831 --> 00:04:41,092
- Did I miss anything?
- Only Jack's speech. Perfect timing.

13
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:44,354
Peter, I'd like to introduce you
to Mrs. Raphael.

14
00:04:44,454 --> 00:04:46,843
Yes, of course. I'm so sorry.
Peter Cleave.

15
00:04:46,949 --> 00:04:49,121
- How do you do?
- Stella Raphael.

16
00:04:49,286 --> 00:04:52,002
Peter is our longest-serving doctor here.

17
00:04:52,101 --> 00:04:54,010
I'm fixtures and fittings.

18
00:04:54,469 --> 00:04:56,411
Forgive me. I need that sausage.

19
00:04:56,549 --> 00:04:57,597
Excuse me.

20
00:04:58,405 --> 00:05:01,372
- What's your field, Dr. Cleave?
- Peter, please.

21
00:05:03,751 --> 00:05:06,117
I tend to deal with the extreme cases.

22
00:05:07,846 --> 00:05:09,372
My particular interest...

23
00:05:09,477 --> 00:05:12,575
is sexual pathology
and its associated catastrophes.

24
00:05:13,701 --> 00:05:17,181
- And what does your wife make of that?
- She doesn't. I'm not.

25
00:05:17,668 --> 00:05:20,537
I spend my life
immersed in the passions of others.

26
00:05:20,643 --> 00:05:23,871
Dangerous sport, love.
I'm not sure I have the stomach for it.

27
00:05:24,356 --> 00:05:25,599
I've been married for 12 years.

28
00:05:25,699 --> 00:05:27,837
I'm not sure
I've ever thought of it as a sport.

29
00:05:27,939 --> 00:05:30,077
Well, marriage
is a different beast entirely.

30
00:05:30,179 --> 00:05:32,002
I'm talking about passion.

31
00:05:34,755 --> 00:05:37,089
What did Cleave
have to say for himself?

32
00:05:37,186 --> 00:05:39,804
This and that. I rather liked him.

33
00:05:40,353 --> 00:05:41,782
Trust me, he's got fangs.

34
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:43,929
- Who has?
- Count Dracula.

35
00:05:45,217 --> 00:05:46,362
He wanted my job.

36
00:05:46,464 --> 00:05:48,766
Thought he deserved it
for his years of loyalty.

37
00:05:49,472 --> 00:05:52,374
Why didn't you speak
to any of the other wives?

38
00:05:53,571 --> 00:05:55,163
There wasn't time.

39
00:05:55,778 --> 00:05:58,265
But I'm so looking forward
to our coffee mornings.

40
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:01,533
You will involve yourself
in the life of the hospital.

41
00:06:01,633 --> 00:06:04,316
- It's expected.
- Of course.

42
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,280
Now, the band. I thought last year's
was splendid. Agreed?

43
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:10,804
Yes, but can we have
some slower numbers this time?

44
00:06:10,911 --> 00:06:13,398
I've only just recovered.
It was exhausting.

45
00:06:14,272 --> 00:06:17,654
Rebook the band, subject to slowies.
Show of hands.

46
00:06:20,062 --> 00:06:21,207
Carried.

47
00:06:21,471 --> 00:06:23,739
Next, do I have any takers for the cake?

48
00:06:25,247 --> 00:06:28,148
Stella, would you like to commandeer
the fruitcake?

49
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:30,326
- I'd be honored.
- Lovely.

50
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:33,331
And if you'll forgive the reminder,
no liqueur.

51
00:06:33,661 --> 00:06:34,970
Alcohol, dear.

52
00:06:35,068 --> 00:06:37,435
Alcohol for the patients, verboten.

53
00:07:35,929 --> 00:07:38,798
Help me! Help me!

54
00:07:39,705 --> 00:07:43,501
Help me! Help me! Help! Help me!

55
00:08:01,366 --> 00:08:02,991
Are you joining us?

56
00:08:04,181 --> 00:08:05,675
No, I'm not. No.

57
00:08:05,781 --> 00:08:07,308
- It's this way.
- No.

58
00:08:08,309 --> 00:08:10,861
But you're not allowed in the corridor!

59
00:08:11,124 --> 00:08:12,368
Come back!

60
00:08:13,044 --> 00:08:15,346
You're going the wrong way!

61
00:08:16,852 --> 00:08:18,258
- I'm so sorry.
- No bother.

62
00:08:27,893 --> 00:08:29,137
Thank you.

63
00:08:31,156 --> 00:08:33,261
I don't mean to nanny,
but it might be wise...

64
00:08:33,364 --> 00:08:36,430
to restrict yourself
to the public areas of the hospital.

65
00:08:36,531 --> 00:08:39,084
One never quite knows
what one might find.

66
00:08:40,531 --> 00:08:42,767
Do the male and female patients
ever mix?

67
00:08:42,867 --> 00:08:45,737
Yes, of course.
At the annual hospital ball.

68
00:08:45,843 --> 00:08:48,232
A perfect opportunity to mingle.

69
00:08:49,106 --> 00:08:51,375
Believe me, once a year is ample.

70
00:08:52,593 --> 00:08:54,698
- Can I give you a hand, Mrs. Bain?
- No.

71
00:08:55,217 --> 00:08:57,104
Thank you, Mrs. Raphael.

72
00:09:04,303 --> 00:09:06,791
How did my predecessor fill her days?

73
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,575
She sewed. Tapestry.

74
00:09:10,319 --> 00:09:13,418
One year, she did all the hospital,
seen from above.

75
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,578
Mommy! Come and see!

76
00:09:21,904 --> 00:09:23,976
- What, darling?
- Come and see!

77
00:09:31,311 --> 00:09:33,252
Edgar, this is my mother.

78
00:09:34,286 --> 00:09:37,285
We've invented a test of strength.
Will you time us?

79
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:39,941
I don't have my watch on, darling.

80
00:09:40,045 --> 00:09:41,322
Just count then.

81
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:44,745
Ready and lift.

82
00:09:45,389 --> 00:09:46,436
Go.

83
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:50,948
1, 2, 3, 4, 5...

84
00:09:51,309 --> 00:09:55,683
6, 7, 8, 9, 10...

85
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:59,307
11, 12, 13...

86
00:09:59,404 --> 00:10:01,792
14, 15, 16...

87
00:10:01,899 --> 00:10:03,273
Put him down.

88
00:10:04,362 --> 00:10:07,263
Sorry. I didn't see you there,
Mrs. Raphael.

89
00:10:08,617 --> 00:10:10,027
Come on, Charlie.

90
00:10:15,659 --> 00:10:17,252
Thank you, Mrs. Bain.

91
00:10:26,441 --> 00:10:29,669
Charlie's made a new friend,
that man doing the glasshouse.

92
00:10:29,769 --> 00:10:32,006
- Oh, good.
- Is he safe?

93
00:10:33,129 --> 00:10:35,071
He wouldn't be in our garden
if he wasn't.

94
00:10:35,177 --> 00:10:37,184
Working is a privilege.
It can take years to earn it.

95
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:39,231
They've all been fully vetted.

96
00:10:39,465 --> 00:10:42,978
- Is he one of yours?
- No, Cleave's. His favorite, I think.

97
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,945
- Favorite?
- It's not unusual to have a pet patient.

98
00:10:47,463 --> 00:10:48,772
Who's yours?

99
00:10:51,046 --> 00:10:52,061
You.

100
00:10:56,453 --> 00:10:58,755
Why is Peter Cleave so taken with him?

101
00:10:58,853 --> 00:11:01,157
You know him,
fancies himself an aesthete...

102
00:11:01,255 --> 00:11:03,621
and the fellow used to be a sculptor.

103
00:11:04,007 --> 00:11:05,435
What did he do?

104
00:11:06,983 --> 00:11:08,444
Heads, I think.

105
00:11:09,031 --> 00:11:10,558
- No, I meant...
- I know what you meant.

106
00:11:10,662 --> 00:11:13,729
I interviewed him myself.
Charlie is perfectly safe.

107
00:11:23,013 --> 00:11:24,093
Hello.

108
00:11:24,965 --> 00:11:27,931
I'm sorry about the other day.
I hope you didn't get into trouble.

109
00:11:28,036 --> 00:11:30,653
No more than I'm in already,
Mrs. Raphael.

110
00:11:52,867 --> 00:11:55,452
My husband tells me
you were a sculptor.

111
00:11:55,907 --> 00:11:57,314
I still am.

112
00:11:58,242 --> 00:12:01,144
- May I ask how long you've been here?
- You may.

113
00:12:02,146 --> 00:12:03,161
And?

114
00:12:04,834 --> 00:12:06,078
Six years.

115
00:12:10,753 --> 00:12:12,280
I killed my wife.

116
00:12:14,177 --> 00:12:15,670
She betrayed me.

117
00:12:37,501 --> 00:12:38,876
Mrs. Raphael.

118
00:12:40,574 --> 00:12:42,485
What have you done to him?

119
00:12:43,456 --> 00:12:44,830
Mrs. Raphael!

120
00:12:47,071 --> 00:12:49,274
He was climbing a tree. He fell.

121
00:12:59,068 --> 00:13:00,857
Can Edgar stay for tea?

122
00:13:02,845 --> 00:13:06,641
- I'm afraid he can't. He...
- I've got to get back to work, Charlie.

123
00:13:10,107 --> 00:13:11,220
Thanks.

124
00:13:24,602 --> 00:13:25,845
How is he?

125
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:28,021
He's fine, thank you.

126
00:13:30,553 --> 00:13:33,302
I don't think
he'll be climbing any trees just yet.

127
00:13:33,401 --> 00:13:36,120
I don't know. Not my position...

128
00:13:36,955 --> 00:13:38,994
but I reckon he's an adventurer.

129
00:13:39,546 --> 00:13:41,171
You might be right.

130
00:13:41,977 --> 00:13:44,181
I suppose he gets that from you.

131
00:13:46,233 --> 00:13:47,509
I doubt it.

132
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,608
It must be your husband then.

133
00:13:56,472 --> 00:13:58,032
Interesting dress.

134
00:13:59,224 --> 00:14:02,093
- Is that a compliment?
- Yes.

135
00:14:03,543 --> 00:14:06,772
Might it be a touch too revealing,
given the occasion?

136
00:14:07,191 --> 00:14:09,460
I'll mention it to my dressmaker.

137
00:14:10,774 --> 00:14:12,235
What a good idea.

138
00:14:21,588 --> 00:14:22,962
United front.

139
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:41,861
May I have the pleasure?

140
00:16:53,928 --> 00:16:57,125
- Can you keep a secret?
- Depends what it is.

141
00:16:57,832 --> 00:17:00,103
Jack told me
he's planning to retire next year.

142
00:17:00,265 --> 00:17:03,166
I wonder who he's recommending
as his successor.

143
00:17:04,008 --> 00:17:06,593
- Would it be someone I know?
- It would.

144
00:17:07,368 --> 00:17:10,215
- Is it Peter Cleave?
- Very droll.

145
00:17:11,431 --> 00:17:14,529
Congratulations. That's wonderful news.

146
00:17:17,351 --> 00:17:19,806
It'll be a huge commitment
for both of us.

147
00:17:20,103 --> 00:17:23,583
I know it's not exactly ideal here
for you and Charlie, but it'll change.

148
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:26,309
We'll have that house and a garden.

149
00:17:26,693 --> 00:17:28,515
We'll be able to settle.

150
00:17:38,276 --> 00:17:40,381
Thank you for dancing with me.

151
00:17:44,676 --> 00:17:46,236
I can't take those.

152
00:17:53,445 --> 00:17:55,484
You could take what they mean.

153
00:18:00,899 --> 00:18:02,841
- Hello, Mr. Archer.
- Edgar.

154
00:18:21,473 --> 00:18:22,717
Break over!

155
00:22:26,252 --> 00:22:28,521
How are you finding Mrs. Raphael?

156
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,787
I don't have much to do with her.

157
00:22:30,892 --> 00:22:32,615
I'm busy with my work.

158
00:22:32,716 --> 00:22:36,938
But Mr. Archer tells me
of your recent interest in horticulture.

159
00:22:37,388 --> 00:22:40,966
She's kind to me. I gave her
some flowers a few weeks ago.

160
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:43,113
And you danced with her.

161
00:22:43,947 --> 00:22:46,913
Only to show you
I can behave myself with a woman.

162
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:48,646
I don't doubt it.

163
00:22:48,746 --> 00:22:52,390
- You're pleased with my progress?
- I'm not here to judge you.

164
00:22:53,609 --> 00:22:56,576
But, yes,
you're progressing as one would want.

165
00:22:57,323 --> 00:22:59,363
And, in time...

166
00:23:00,394 --> 00:23:02,783
work duties lead to my release?

167
00:23:03,338 --> 00:23:05,028
Have patience, Edgar.

168
00:23:05,993 --> 00:23:08,360
We still have many mountains to climb.

169
00:23:09,897 --> 00:23:11,936
I've always done
everything you've asked.

170
00:23:12,041 --> 00:23:15,335
Indeed, but that does not make you
ready for the world.

171
00:23:15,528 --> 00:23:18,877
- But you've cured me.
- Of what exactly?

172
00:23:19,752 --> 00:23:21,857
Severe personality disorder...

173
00:23:22,856 --> 00:23:25,092
with features of morbid jealousy.

174
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:32,292
Continue with your work,
and we'll continue to take a view.

175
00:24:02,629 --> 00:24:04,287
Any news on the job?

176
00:24:05,125 --> 00:24:07,132
You'll be the first to know.

177
00:24:08,868 --> 00:24:10,842
Stella behaving herself?

178
00:24:11,683 --> 00:24:12,992
Yes, Mother.

179
00:24:15,331 --> 00:24:17,567
That fellow's done wonders
with your glasshouse.

180
00:24:17,667 --> 00:24:19,488
Yes, it's scrubbed up rather well,
hasn't it?

181
00:24:19,586 --> 00:24:22,882
Our rockery resembles Berlin in '45.

182
00:24:24,226 --> 00:24:25,655
Perhaps you could pass him over to us.

183
00:24:25,762 --> 00:24:28,413
I don't know if it's my imagination,
but isn't he rather attractive?

184
00:24:28,513 --> 00:24:30,171
- It's your imagination.
- He is attractive.

185
00:24:30,273 --> 00:24:33,884
- Did he do something rather nasty?
- He murdered his wife.

186
00:24:34,593 --> 00:24:37,342
Obviously sane.
Can't think why we got him.

187
00:24:38,399 --> 00:24:39,895
What will happen to him?

188
00:24:40,002 --> 00:24:42,522
I have no idea.
That's Peter's department.

189
00:24:42,625 --> 00:24:46,684
I suspect he will be overhauling
rockeries for a good few years to come.

190
00:24:47,488 --> 00:24:50,685
Here's to locking the door
and throwing away the key.

191
00:24:53,921 --> 00:24:57,019
What the hell is wrong with you?
You had no right to say that.

192
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,218
The way he casually dismissed that
man's whole future, it was sickening.

193
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,294
Policy is not your concern.

194
00:25:02,975 --> 00:25:07,000
- I thought the policy was to reform.
- It's none of your bloody business!

195
00:25:07,102 --> 00:25:10,200
- Is it really so difficult to behave?
- Like the other wives?

196
00:25:10,302 --> 00:25:13,563
- Like the other little ladies?
- Frankly, yes.

197
00:25:17,949 --> 00:25:20,153
- Bye, Mrs. Bain.
- Behave yourself, Charlie.

198
00:25:34,525 --> 00:25:36,313
Here, let me show you.

199
00:25:58,010 --> 00:25:59,221
Not here.

200
00:26:24,313 --> 00:26:25,622
Oh, no!

201
00:26:54,101 --> 00:26:56,883
- I just had a bath.
- Your point being?

202
00:27:07,891 --> 00:27:09,865
- I forgot my checkbook.
- Oh.

203
00:27:10,707 --> 00:27:13,873
- Where did you last see it?
- Well, I don't know, do I?

204
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:30,734
Here it is.

205
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:35,086
Here we go, young man.

206
00:27:35,698 --> 00:27:38,512
Let's go to the zoo.
Shall we do that first?

207
00:27:38,609 --> 00:27:41,457
And then we can go
into the shop we went to...

208
00:28:13,551 --> 00:28:15,112
Are you all right?

209
00:28:16,463 --> 00:28:18,219
Have you seen a ghost?

210
00:28:21,231 --> 00:28:23,205
What's the matter, darling?

211
00:28:24,367 --> 00:28:26,024
There was a patient.

212
00:28:26,318 --> 00:28:29,351
- What patient? Where?
- In the house.

213
00:28:30,221 --> 00:28:32,610
He might've been in Mommy's bedroom.

214
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:38,148
Who was he? Do you know him?

215
00:29:07,947 --> 00:29:10,019
Can I use the phone, please?

216
00:29:10,506 --> 00:29:12,361
Is everything all right?

217
00:29:27,912 --> 00:29:32,384
It's been suggested
that your dealings with Edgar Stark...

218
00:29:32,487 --> 00:29:34,908
went beyond propriety.

219
00:29:35,048 --> 00:29:37,414
- Suggested by who?
- John Archer.

220
00:29:38,758 --> 00:29:41,441
And there have been whispers
among the patients.

221
00:29:41,542 --> 00:29:42,885
These rumors soon get back to me.

222
00:29:42,983 --> 00:29:45,154
Naturally, I give them no credence...

223
00:29:45,255 --> 00:29:48,071
but I do need to know
why they might have arisen.

224
00:29:48,392 --> 00:29:50,531
Stella talked to Stark in the garden.

225
00:29:50,631 --> 00:29:53,314
She talks to many of the patients.
What of it?

226
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:55,871
Stella?

227
00:29:57,223 --> 00:30:00,964
Well, Charlie was fond of him so
of course I spoke to him occasionally.

228
00:30:01,062 --> 00:30:04,161
- You danced with him at the ball.
- I danced with you, too.

229
00:30:23,362 --> 00:30:25,054
I'm afraid it's true.

230
00:30:25,539 --> 00:30:26,716
My God!

231
00:30:27,491 --> 00:30:29,727
- Does Max know?
- I suspect so.

232
00:30:30,178 --> 00:30:32,088
It's a bloody catastrophe!

233
00:30:32,419 --> 00:30:35,713
The Home Office will be apoplectic,
and in my last year.

234
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:39,259
- Doubtless they'll require a head to roll.
- Well, they're not having mine!

235
00:30:39,972 --> 00:30:41,946
Did you never think
the man might try to escape?

236
00:30:42,052 --> 00:30:45,085
Of course not.
Otherwise, I would have prevented it.

237
00:30:46,306 --> 00:30:49,721
Well, you were right about Max.
He's not for us.

238
00:30:50,818 --> 00:30:53,119
Appalling, bloody stupid woman!

239
00:30:53,217 --> 00:30:56,347
She practically chauffeured the man
out of the door!

240
00:30:57,696 --> 00:31:01,046
As for the wife, never in 40 years.

241
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:04,089
He obviously has no control over her.

242
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:06,810
Who will be her next prey,
for God's sake?

243
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,044
He'll have to go.

244
00:31:10,144 --> 00:31:13,689
May I suggest that we don't toss
that particular bone to the press?

245
00:31:13,791 --> 00:31:15,351
At least, not yet.

246
00:31:16,351 --> 00:31:20,726
We'll be crucified in the papers as it is.
They love a madman on the loose.

247
00:31:21,278 --> 00:31:25,019
We must preserve the integrity
of the hospital for the future.

248
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:31,387
Peter, when the Inspector arrives...

249
00:31:31,487 --> 00:31:33,788
do you think we can play down
the more lurid aspects...

250
00:31:33,887 --> 00:31:36,156
of Stark's recent activities?

251
00:31:36,767 --> 00:31:38,173
Naturally.

252
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:42,487
Do you think Stella
helped him to escape?

253
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:46,293
Not particularly. She was manipulated.

254
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:50,581
I suspect she's fallen in love with him.

255
00:31:52,988 --> 00:31:54,394
You're fixated.

256
00:31:54,492 --> 00:31:57,559
That's why you passed him fit for work
when you knew he was unstable.

257
00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:00,726
Drivel. Your wife destabilized him.

258
00:32:00,828 --> 00:32:04,176
One could hardly have predicted
that element in the equation.

259
00:32:05,883 --> 00:32:09,711
I assume you're acting as Jack's
factotum sent to extract my resignation?

260
00:32:09,818 --> 00:32:13,679
Spare us the grandiosity. Just get on
with your work and keep quiet.

261
00:32:14,169 --> 00:32:16,656
I might remind you
that I'm your superior.

262
00:32:16,761 --> 00:32:18,102
In what sense?

263
00:32:32,313 --> 00:32:33,459
How long?

264
00:32:34,394 --> 00:32:37,393
- You're supposed to time me.
- I'm sorry, darling.

265
00:32:39,225 --> 00:32:41,810
If they catch him, will he be in trouble?

266
00:32:44,056 --> 00:32:47,536
I don't think they will catch him.
He's been gone too long.

267
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:50,705
I think he's on a boat
sailing back to Australia.

268
00:33:09,716 --> 00:33:12,271
I think you should come and talk to me.

269
00:33:13,814 --> 00:33:15,724
Unofficially, of course.

270
00:33:18,262 --> 00:33:19,723
Let me help you.

271
00:33:52,818 --> 00:33:56,778
I might go up to town tomorrow
and do some early Christmas shopping.

272
00:33:57,297 --> 00:33:59,948
- Something for me?
- Wait and see.

273
00:34:43,533 --> 00:34:45,900
I'm Nick. It was me on the phone.

274
00:34:46,636 --> 00:34:48,393
Why were you so late?

275
00:34:49,389 --> 00:34:51,756
Had to be sure you weren't followed.

276
00:34:53,647 --> 00:34:55,337
How do you know him?

277
00:34:56,014 --> 00:34:57,868
I was his assistant...

278
00:34:59,021 --> 00:35:00,133
before.

279
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:11,394
Did you think I'd abandoned you?

280
00:36:13,319 --> 00:36:15,904
I couldn't contact you till it was safe.

281
00:36:18,181 --> 00:36:19,741
And it's safe now?

282
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,404
- How was London?
- Busy.

283
00:36:42,821 --> 00:36:45,820
I saw something for you,
but they didn't have your size.

284
00:36:45,923 --> 00:36:48,411
I have to go and collect it next week.

285
00:37:17,183 --> 00:37:18,645
Successful trip?

286
00:37:21,279 --> 00:37:23,547
You find what you were after?

287
00:37:24,062 --> 00:37:25,491
Yes. Finally.

288
00:37:26,942 --> 00:37:28,253
Where is it?

289
00:37:31,103 --> 00:37:32,478
Your shopping.

290
00:37:32,672 --> 00:37:34,527
The shopping you did in London.
Where is it?

291
00:37:34,623 --> 00:37:37,143
- It's for Christmas. I've hidden it.
- Where?

292
00:37:37,759 --> 00:37:40,793
- If I told you, it wouldn't be hidden.
- Show me what you bought.

293
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,480
Show me! Damn you!

294
00:37:52,509 --> 00:37:53,971
Happy Christmas.

295
00:38:10,971 --> 00:38:12,280
Forgive me.

296
00:38:53,528 --> 00:38:55,022
Does he suspect?

297
00:38:56,695 --> 00:38:58,550
He's buried in his work.

298
00:38:59,255 --> 00:39:00,880
Do you share a bed?

299
00:39:08,407 --> 00:39:09,652
I'm yours.

300
00:39:14,007 --> 00:39:15,862
So don't go back to him.

301
00:39:16,343 --> 00:39:17,968
Come and live with me.

302
00:39:19,191 --> 00:39:21,263
I can't just leave my family.

303
00:39:21,974 --> 00:39:23,348
Yes, you can.

304
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:27,857
Give them up or don't come back.

305
00:39:30,549 --> 00:39:33,898
Once you're here,
we'll find a way to bring Charlie, too.

306
00:39:35,476 --> 00:39:36,589
Please.

307
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:39,501
I can't share you.

308
00:39:48,307 --> 00:39:49,419
Decide.

309
00:39:56,722 --> 00:39:58,096
How is Edgar?

310
00:39:59,889 --> 00:40:01,321
What on earth do you mean?

311
00:40:01,428 --> 00:40:05,170
Your housekeeper let slip
you're taking regular trips to London.

312
00:40:05,491 --> 00:40:07,760
You're seeing him, aren't you?

313
00:40:10,259 --> 00:40:13,870
If you knew women, you'd know
they like to shop occasionally.

314
00:40:21,329 --> 00:40:24,875
Don't delude yourself
you're in love with a tortured genius.

315
00:40:26,192 --> 00:40:27,752
He's a failed artist...

316
00:40:27,856 --> 00:40:31,053
infinitely more dangerous
both to you and himself.

317
00:40:32,336 --> 00:40:34,670
He's mine, and he needs my help.

318
00:40:36,272 --> 00:40:38,126
Evidently, he disagrees.

319
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:44,077
You should know
what he did to his wife.

320
00:40:44,814 --> 00:40:47,115
I don't need to know.
I have nothing to do with the man.

321
00:40:47,213 --> 00:40:50,595
He beat her to death with a hammer
and then decapitated her.

322
00:40:51,693 --> 00:40:53,669
He took a scalpel and cut out her eyes...

323
00:40:53,774 --> 00:40:57,156
and then he hacked at her face
as if it were clay.

324
00:40:59,694 --> 00:41:01,963
Perhaps there won't be
any more trips to London.

325
00:41:02,061 --> 00:41:04,712
Perhaps your mental state is too fragile.

326
00:41:06,414 --> 00:41:09,228
With Max's consent,
we can hold you here.

327
00:41:10,701 --> 00:41:12,839
- Nonsense.
- But we can.

328
00:41:17,292 --> 00:41:19,463
For your own safety, of course.

329
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,277
Stella...

330
00:41:23,179 --> 00:41:24,836
tell me where he is.

331
00:41:50,442 --> 00:41:53,857
Mrs. B, how do you spell amoeba?

332
00:41:54,346 --> 00:41:56,321
With a dictionary, my dear.

333
00:41:56,746 --> 00:42:00,323
Don't ask me.
I've got the brain of an amoeba.

334
00:42:34,053 --> 00:42:35,037
She's...

335
00:42:36,902 --> 00:42:38,625
She's having a little holiday.

336
00:42:40,166 --> 00:42:42,468
I'm sure she'll be back very soon.

337
00:42:49,348 --> 00:42:51,006
Shall I read to you?

338
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:57,849
Has she gone to Australia?

339
00:43:06,754 --> 00:43:08,761
"That was Tom's great secret...

340
00:43:08,866 --> 00:43:11,255
"the scheme to return home
with his brother pirates...

341
00:43:11,361 --> 00:43:13,696
"and attend their own funerals.

342
00:43:13,890 --> 00:43:17,272
"They had paddled over to the Missouri
shore on a log, at dusk on Saturday."

343
00:43:34,593 --> 00:43:36,218
Can I move, please?

344
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,407
I've got pins and needles.

345
00:43:44,351 --> 00:43:47,449
She taught me lots of things.
She's a black Caribbean.

346
00:43:47,743 --> 00:43:51,005
Have you had a black woman?
No, you haven't. I have.

347
00:43:53,023 --> 00:43:55,412
I was very drunk, but you know...

348
00:43:56,223 --> 00:43:59,735
I couldn't quite do the samba.
She taught me a lot of things.

349
00:44:05,885 --> 00:44:07,194
Take it off.

350
00:44:16,027 --> 00:44:17,339
I'm working!

351
00:44:23,709 --> 00:44:26,578
- I'm going for a walk, all right?
- Be careful.

352
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:03,124
Thank you.

353
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:14,223
- Are you following me?
- No.

354
00:45:15,001 --> 00:45:17,848
What? You just like hanging around
in markets?

355
00:45:23,384 --> 00:45:25,751
Have you any reason not to trust me?

356
00:45:25,847 --> 00:45:28,335
- So why have me followed?
- It won't happen again. Sorry.

357
00:45:28,439 --> 00:45:31,122
- Why don't you trust me?
- I said I'm sorry.

358
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:38,830
I'm working.

359
00:45:38,933 --> 00:45:41,900
You're always working.
It's just like being with my husband.

360
00:45:42,965 --> 00:45:45,037
- Is it?
- Yes.

361
00:45:45,141 --> 00:45:47,726
- Like being with your husband, is it?
- Yes.

362
00:45:47,829 --> 00:45:49,290
- Just like home?
- Yes.

363
00:45:49,396 --> 00:45:52,745
- Is this what he was like?
- Yes.

364
00:45:54,707 --> 00:45:55,951
Like this?

365
00:45:59,317 --> 00:46:02,578
- Hooray! Look at that.
- Wonderful.

366
00:46:10,451 --> 00:46:13,070
- Tell me.
- I miss Charlie.

367
00:46:15,892 --> 00:46:19,055
It's all right. Don't be sad.

368
00:46:50,481 --> 00:46:51,757
I love you.

369
00:46:51,857 --> 00:46:53,864
It doesn't matter, but I do.

370
00:46:54,993 --> 00:46:57,894
- No, you don't.
- I do.

371
00:47:00,815 --> 00:47:02,309
I love him, too.

372
00:47:04,751 --> 00:47:07,719
- Happy Christmas, Stella.
- Thank you.

373
00:47:13,710 --> 00:47:16,426
You touch her again, I'll fucking kill you!

374
00:47:38,284 --> 00:47:39,844
Please stay, Nick.

375
00:47:40,491 --> 00:47:43,340
I'm gonna clear out my stuff
before he gets back.

376
00:47:45,292 --> 00:47:46,982
There's no point in arguing.

377
00:47:51,019 --> 00:47:52,874
It's not my place, but...

378
00:47:55,910 --> 00:47:58,015
Maybe you should come with me.

379
00:48:01,285 --> 00:48:03,706
He's turning. I've seen it before.

380
00:48:05,702 --> 00:48:07,108
With his wife?

381
00:48:08,325 --> 00:48:09,786
I saw the body.

382
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:13,090
Please don't stay here.

383
00:48:32,386 --> 00:48:34,396
I thought you'd been caught.

384
00:48:34,852 --> 00:48:37,983
- Is that what you want?
- No, of course not.

385
00:48:39,683 --> 00:48:42,049
- Are you missing your comforts?
- No.

386
00:48:43,107 --> 00:48:44,895
You were going to Nick.

387
00:48:49,762 --> 00:48:52,249
Are you going to start hitting me now?

388
00:49:20,062 --> 00:49:21,338
I love you.

389
00:49:24,159 --> 00:49:25,403
I love you.

390
00:50:05,466 --> 00:50:09,110
He needs help. Can you find a doctor?

391
00:50:10,009 --> 00:50:11,831
I'll see what I can do.

392
00:50:34,841 --> 00:50:37,623
- I saw you together. You're fucking him.
- No.

393
00:51:20,981 --> 00:51:21,963
Eat.

394
00:51:23,766 --> 00:51:27,540
When my wife took her lovers,
she tried to poison me.

395
00:51:29,525 --> 00:51:30,506
Eat.

396
00:52:11,406 --> 00:52:13,478
You've checked those clothes?

397
00:52:27,341 --> 00:52:28,716
Mrs. Raphael.

398
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:50,885
Let's go.

399
00:53:14,025 --> 00:53:16,326
You'll be released in the morning.

400
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:22,178
Could I see Charlie?

401
00:53:26,248 --> 00:53:30,524
You're aware I could prevent you from
having any further contact with him.

402
00:53:32,166 --> 00:53:33,692
But he needs you.

403
00:53:36,069 --> 00:53:37,924
You'll see him tomorrow.

404
00:53:41,351 --> 00:53:42,627
Thank you.

405
00:53:55,270 --> 00:53:57,571
Mr. Raphael, this way please, sir.

406
00:54:00,005 --> 00:54:01,892
Mr. Raphael,
do you have any comments?

407
00:54:46,530 --> 00:54:49,791
There's a blanket in the back
if you want to sleep. It's a long journey.

408
00:54:49,889 --> 00:54:51,929
- Where are we going?
- Wales.

409
00:54:52,833 --> 00:54:54,872
- What?
- Wales.

410
00:54:55,936 --> 00:54:57,244
North Wales.

411
00:54:58,207 --> 00:55:01,403
Sheep, tractors,
and a genetic hatred of the English.

412
00:55:03,262 --> 00:55:05,945
Once it got in the papers,
I was dismissed.

413
00:55:06,558 --> 00:55:09,492
I managed to get a position
at a local hospital.

414
00:55:10,205 --> 00:55:12,792
- Jack fired you?
- No.

415
00:55:14,398 --> 00:55:15,804
His successor.

416
00:56:39,159 --> 00:56:40,435
You asleep?

417
00:56:46,743 --> 00:56:48,368
Are you better now?

418
00:56:49,782 --> 00:56:52,978
I'll never go away again. I promise.

419
00:56:55,414 --> 00:56:57,137
I'm very, very sorry.

420
00:57:09,269 --> 00:57:11,538
Thank you for letting me see him.

421
00:57:12,086 --> 00:57:14,573
A stronger man would have let you rot.

422
00:57:15,157 --> 00:57:18,124
- You're strong.
- Don't be trite.

423
00:57:19,252 --> 00:57:21,619
I wasn't strong enough to keep you.

424
00:57:28,531 --> 00:57:31,116
- Good night.
- Good night.

425
00:57:48,432 --> 00:57:50,090
A little word of advice.

426
00:57:50,192 --> 00:57:53,126
Don't let your shame
degenerate into self-pity.

427
00:57:53,839 --> 00:57:55,333
It seldom helps.

428
00:58:06,384 --> 00:58:08,140
Settled in all right?

429
00:58:10,033 --> 00:58:11,559
Walking, are you?

430
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:18,472
Charlie.

431
00:58:24,174 --> 00:58:25,156
Mom!

432
00:58:25,262 --> 00:58:26,189
Good morning, sir.

433
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:31,853
Come on.
Good morning, Charlie. You all right?

434
00:58:49,708 --> 00:58:51,563
We can't live like this.

435
00:58:52,557 --> 00:58:54,379
Please come back to us.

436
00:58:57,292 --> 00:58:58,404
Please.

437
00:59:10,282 --> 00:59:11,297
Excuse me.

438
00:59:20,776 --> 00:59:21,856
Hello?

439
00:59:22,536 --> 00:59:25,186
Speak up, will you?
This line's atrocious.

440
00:59:25,544 --> 00:59:27,552
Yes.

441
00:59:27,656 --> 00:59:29,598
<i>- Could you tell me where?
- Yes, Wales.</i>

442
00:59:29,704 --> 00:59:31,013
<i>Do you have an address?</i>

443
00:59:31,112 --> 00:59:33,926
Well, I don't have an address.
Only the hospital. Cledwyn General.

444
00:59:34,023 --> 00:59:36,064
<i>- Could you repeat that, please?
- Cledwyn.</i>

445
00:59:37,607 --> 00:59:39,681
Well, I have no idea. Ask a policeman.

446
00:59:39,785 --> 00:59:41,094
Claudia, who is it?

447
00:59:41,193 --> 00:59:44,007
An old colleague of Dr. Raphael's.
He's a mumbler.

448
00:59:44,105 --> 00:59:45,566
- May I?
- Please.

449
00:59:47,944 --> 00:59:49,253
Who is this?

450
00:59:51,239 --> 00:59:52,318
Hello?

451
00:59:54,663 --> 00:59:55,743
Edgar?

452
01:00:00,775 --> 01:00:04,090
<i>- Are you expecting the police?
- Yes, they're here already.</i>

453
01:00:05,893 --> 01:00:09,438
<i>- If he comes for her?
- I wouldn't like to say what he'd do.</i>

454
01:00:11,556 --> 01:00:13,596
<i>You put her on medication, I assume?</i>

455
01:00:13,924 --> 01:00:15,352
She doesn't need it.

456
01:00:17,124 --> 01:00:18,401
She's fine.

457
01:00:19,684 --> 01:00:22,999
- Goodbye, Mr. Griffin. See you.
- Goodbye.

458
01:00:23,683 --> 01:00:26,553
- Bye.
- Bye, darling. Goodbye.

459
01:00:27,492 --> 01:00:28,833
Bye, Elaine.

460
01:00:29,379 --> 01:00:31,169
- Bye, Charlie.
- Bye, Mr. Griffin.

461
01:00:31,269 --> 01:00:32,795
See you tomorrow.

462
01:00:40,099 --> 01:00:42,554
There's a school field trip next week.

463
01:00:42,915 --> 01:00:44,922
Are parents allowed to come?

464
01:00:56,801 --> 01:00:59,070
If you need me, I'll be upstairs.

465
01:00:59,361 --> 01:01:01,434
I've just got to finish something.

466
01:01:23,329 --> 01:01:24,256
Here.

467
01:01:41,885 --> 01:01:43,860
Parents are allowed on the field trip.

468
01:01:43,965 --> 01:01:45,372
I told a lie.

469
01:01:50,493 --> 01:01:52,762
Well, everyone lies occasionally.

470
01:01:54,012 --> 01:01:55,441
Good for telling me.

471
01:02:00,987 --> 01:02:02,994
Would you like some company?

472
01:02:05,690 --> 01:02:08,243
Well, I don't think I'm busy next week.

473
01:02:37,145 --> 01:02:39,000
I know you long for him.

474
01:02:41,144 --> 01:02:44,013
But you won't see him again.
You know that, don't you?

475
01:02:44,599 --> 01:02:45,581
Yes.

476
01:02:47,992 --> 01:02:50,447
We'll be a family again, like before.

477
01:02:52,343 --> 01:02:54,732
In time, this will be what you want.

478
01:03:24,085 --> 01:03:26,866
Hurry, darling,
we mustn't keep Daddy waiting.

479
01:03:37,267 --> 01:03:38,379
Hello?

480
01:03:48,146 --> 01:03:50,120
- Where's Mommy?
- Phone rang.

481
01:04:00,114 --> 01:04:01,194
Sorry.

482
01:04:03,282 --> 01:04:05,671
- Who was it?
- Mr. Griffin.

483
01:04:06,418 --> 01:04:08,621
Instructions for our field trip.

484
01:04:14,577 --> 01:04:16,584
- Inspector.
- Good morning, Dr. Raphael.

485
01:04:16,688 --> 01:04:18,248
It's good of you to help out.

486
01:05:00,332 --> 01:05:01,510
You came.

487
01:05:10,860 --> 01:05:12,037
Let's go.

488
01:05:15,115 --> 01:05:17,123
I can't leave Charlie again.

489
01:05:17,867 --> 01:05:19,296
I promised him.

490
01:05:20,395 --> 01:05:22,369
I'll never stop loving you.

491
01:05:23,403 --> 01:05:25,290
- Where is he?
- At school.

492
01:05:26,026 --> 01:05:28,611
We'll go and get him. Take him with us.

493
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:53,309
No!

494
01:06:28,293 --> 01:06:29,537
He's gone.

495
01:06:31,397 --> 01:06:33,087
Now let him go!

496
01:06:39,141 --> 01:06:43,364
<i>Six green bottles hanging on the wall</i>

497
01:06:43,781 --> 01:06:47,708
<i>Six green bottles hanging on the wall</i>

498
01:06:47,812 --> 01:06:52,186
<i>And if one green bottle
should accidentally fall</i>

499
01:06:52,291 --> 01:06:56,829
<i>There'll be five green bottles
hanging on the wall</i>

500
01:06:57,250 --> 01:07:01,210
<i>Five green bottles hanging on the wall</i>

501
01:07:01,314 --> 01:07:02,558
<i>Five green</i>

502
01:07:08,897 --> 01:07:11,352
If I can have your attention, please.

503
01:07:11,617 --> 01:07:14,965
Children, don't forget to collect items
of interest in your jam jars.

504
01:07:15,072 --> 01:07:17,078
Now, if you could form yourselves
into groups.

505
01:07:17,184 --> 01:07:19,191
Please, at least one adult in each.

506
01:07:19,970 --> 01:07:21,246
Here we go.

507
01:07:21,601 --> 01:07:24,667
Okay, one, two, there we go.
Thanks, Mrs. Jones.

508
01:07:24,770 --> 01:07:26,144
There we are.

509
01:07:27,552 --> 01:07:30,399
There we are, Mrs. Raphael.
Well done, Charlie.

510
01:07:38,271 --> 01:07:40,181
I'm going to catch a fish.

511
01:07:41,535 --> 01:07:43,226
Won't you need a rod?

512
01:07:43,391 --> 01:07:46,173
I'm hoping a small one
will swim into my jar.

513
01:07:47,358 --> 01:07:50,903
Do you know fish can only
remember things for eight seconds?

514
01:09:08,472 --> 01:09:09,846
Mrs. Raphael!

515
01:09:11,064 --> 01:09:13,071
Mrs. Raphael, do something!

516
01:09:15,319 --> 01:09:16,725
Do something!

517
01:10:14,129 --> 01:10:15,537
Thank you so much.

518
01:10:18,290 --> 01:10:20,177
Such difficult circumstances.

519
01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:51,916
Excuse me.

520
01:10:53,999 --> 01:10:54,860
Jack.

521
01:10:56,399 --> 01:10:57,327
Jack...

522
01:10:58,735 --> 01:11:00,938
you must come and visit me soon.

523
01:11:01,678 --> 01:11:03,271
Maybe next summer.

524
01:11:04,366 --> 01:11:06,755
It's so kind of you to deal with all this.
Poor Max.

525
01:11:06,862 --> 01:11:08,552
The least I could do.

526
01:11:10,733 --> 01:11:12,805
Max is in complete agreement.

527
01:11:13,325 --> 01:11:16,008
Of course, I had to arrange things
with the Home Office.

528
01:11:16,108 --> 01:11:18,924
It was a little bit sticky, but we got there.

529
01:11:20,172 --> 01:11:23,467
Well, arranging things is your forte,
isn't it, Peter?

530
01:11:24,811 --> 01:11:26,338
Goodbye, my dear.

531
01:11:32,202 --> 01:11:34,820
Well, shall I keep you informed?

532
01:11:36,235 --> 01:11:37,926
I don't want to know.

533
01:11:38,827 --> 01:11:40,072
Oh, my dear.

534
01:11:41,772 --> 01:11:45,033
Peter, I just wanted
to thank you for so many things.

535
01:11:45,131 --> 01:11:47,749
So sorry, dear Max.

536
01:12:11,846 --> 01:12:15,042
I want you to understand
what's going to happen next.

537
01:12:15,847 --> 01:12:17,789
The shock will wear off...

538
01:12:17,895 --> 01:12:20,677
and it will be replaced
by a devastating grief.

539
01:12:21,254 --> 01:12:24,254
In time, you'll come to terms
with what you've done...

540
01:12:24,359 --> 01:12:26,398
and you'll just be very, very sad.

541
01:12:27,528 --> 01:12:30,429
And that sadness will stay with you...

542
01:12:31,367 --> 01:12:33,276
for the rest of your life.

543
01:13:08,003 --> 01:13:10,042
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

544
01:13:31,041 --> 01:13:32,318
Come now.

545
01:13:43,072 --> 01:13:44,316
Good girl.

546
01:13:47,103 --> 01:13:48,598
Where's Charlie?

547
01:13:49,599 --> 01:13:53,276
- Where's my picture of Charlie?
- With your belongings.

548
01:13:54,527 --> 01:13:56,534
- You mean, I can't see him?
- Not yet.

549
01:13:58,494 --> 01:14:00,665
Because I killed him, didn't I?

550
01:14:06,237 --> 01:14:07,284
Come here.

551
01:14:48,890 --> 01:14:50,417
Is Edgar here?

552
01:14:51,514 --> 01:14:52,942
Of course not.

553
01:14:54,585 --> 01:14:55,894
Where is he?

554
01:14:57,464 --> 01:15:00,051
The past, Stella.

555
01:15:01,626 --> 01:15:03,186
He's in the past.

556
01:15:24,728 --> 01:15:26,157
Good afternoon.

557
01:15:30,902 --> 01:15:33,389
If you won't speak, I can't treat you.

558
01:15:35,958 --> 01:15:38,413
Do you want to stay in solitary forever?

559
01:15:40,757 --> 01:15:43,245
Talk. Say something!

560
01:15:46,676 --> 01:15:48,399
Express your contempt.

561
01:16:00,373 --> 01:16:01,649
She's here.

562
01:16:03,318 --> 01:16:05,586
She's been here six weeks.

563
01:16:07,124 --> 01:16:08,651
She's my patient.

564
01:16:12,180 --> 01:16:13,161
Why?

565
01:16:18,034 --> 01:16:19,660
Something terrible.

566
01:16:24,465 --> 01:16:25,959
The boy drowned.

567
01:16:28,401 --> 01:16:30,953
Yes, you were fond of him.

568
01:16:35,089 --> 01:16:36,998
Would you like to see her?

569
01:16:40,177 --> 01:16:41,256
Speak.

570
01:17:04,144 --> 01:17:05,125
Thank you.

571
01:17:06,895 --> 01:17:08,552
Did you do as I asked?

572
01:17:08,654 --> 01:17:11,588
To think rigorously
about what it means to love?

573
01:17:13,390 --> 01:17:16,521
I'm beginning to understand
that it was never real.

574
01:17:17,485 --> 01:17:19,557
That it was all an obsession.

575
01:17:21,869 --> 01:17:24,356
Can you define your feelings for him?

576
01:17:27,724 --> 01:17:29,034
I have none.

577
01:17:30,477 --> 01:17:32,964
It's over. It ended when Charlie died.

578
01:17:33,998 --> 01:17:36,867
If I told you he was here,
in the hospital?

579
01:17:39,245 --> 01:17:42,146
Well, I suppose it would be logical
if he were.

580
01:17:46,667 --> 01:17:48,772
The question was hypothetical.

581
01:18:00,874 --> 01:18:03,427
You've been very brave
these past weeks.

582
01:18:03,978 --> 01:18:05,504
Thank you, Peter.

583
01:18:37,351 --> 01:18:39,653
I see you've got a flat tire.

584
01:18:42,854 --> 01:18:44,480
I don't need a car.

585
01:18:46,630 --> 01:18:48,964
- Not for work?
- I've resigned.

586
01:18:50,950 --> 01:18:54,017
I think I might go into teaching. I'm...

587
01:18:55,238 --> 01:18:57,725
- I might be quite good with children.
- Yes.

588
01:18:59,045 --> 01:19:00,289
Good idea.

589
01:19:01,765 --> 01:19:03,652
What do you want from me?

590
01:19:08,324 --> 01:19:09,338
Come.

591
01:19:11,427 --> 01:19:13,598
Welcome. Thank you, nurse.

592
01:19:16,740 --> 01:19:19,936
Would you like a drink?
I usually have one about now.

593
01:19:21,507 --> 01:19:23,166
- I'd love one.
- Yes.

594
01:19:25,123 --> 01:19:26,367
The usual?

595
01:19:27,075 --> 01:19:29,018
Your old usual, should I say?

596
01:19:35,971 --> 01:19:37,400
Your health.

597
01:19:40,866 --> 01:19:42,392
Yesterday, I went to see Max.

598
01:19:42,497 --> 01:19:45,246
I made a suggestion
with which he concurred.

599
01:19:46,785 --> 01:19:49,752
My contacts at the Home Office
might well release you from here...

600
01:19:49,856 --> 01:19:53,785
were I to guarantee
your continued treatment and safety.

601
01:19:57,247 --> 01:19:59,319
What I mean to say is that...

602
01:19:59,807 --> 01:20:02,654
were you to live with me, in my house...

603
01:20:03,262 --> 01:20:06,611
these conditions
would most likely be satisfied.

604
01:20:08,864 --> 01:20:11,712
I can offer you a fine home
and a decent life...

605
01:20:12,192 --> 01:20:15,988
traveling, art, gardening, and so on.

606
01:20:16,863 --> 01:20:19,733
But I'm still married to Max.

607
01:20:20,736 --> 01:20:22,590
He wants to divorce you.

608
01:20:30,462 --> 01:20:32,349
You're a very dark horse.

609
01:20:33,021 --> 01:20:36,500
Well, I assure you this is not
my usual procedure with patients.

610
01:20:36,733 --> 01:20:39,187
It's something
that rather crept up on me.

611
01:20:41,051 --> 01:20:44,367
It would be arrogant to suggest
that you might love me.

612
01:20:46,043 --> 01:20:48,248
But I believe you need me at present...

613
01:20:48,347 --> 01:20:52,307
and perhaps, in time, this need
might grow into love of some variety.

614
01:20:55,739 --> 01:20:57,943
Are you a passionate man, Peter?

615
01:21:00,732 --> 01:21:04,310
I think that's something
we'd have to discover.

616
01:21:06,139 --> 01:21:09,270
What would she want
with an old queen like you?

617
01:21:10,010 --> 01:21:11,733
We have dialogue.

618
01:21:11,834 --> 01:21:15,216
I'm disappointed.
I thought you wanted me.

619
01:21:16,218 --> 01:21:18,934
You resent it, don't you?

620
01:21:20,313 --> 01:21:23,160
That she might find happiness
with someone else?

621
01:21:31,639 --> 01:21:34,356
I wondered if you might like this.

622
01:21:37,239 --> 01:21:38,515
Oh, Peter.

623
01:21:39,735 --> 01:21:41,677
Thank you. It's beautiful.

624
01:21:42,935 --> 01:21:44,561
It was my mother's.

625
01:21:53,655 --> 01:21:54,833
Shall we?

626
01:22:00,502 --> 01:22:01,517
Here.

627
01:22:06,421 --> 01:22:09,203
The ladies were discussing
the hospital ball.

628
01:22:10,964 --> 01:22:12,853
Would you like to attend?

629
01:22:15,413 --> 01:22:16,787
I'm not sure.

630
01:22:17,684 --> 01:22:21,394
Well, it might be difficult for you.
Memories and so on.

631
01:22:24,371 --> 01:22:27,567
- You'll be there?
- Well, of course. Yes, that's true.

632
01:22:33,138 --> 01:22:34,796
Will Edgar be there?

633
01:22:39,825 --> 01:22:42,926
If we're to be married, Peter,
let's not have lies.

634
01:22:49,842 --> 01:22:51,532
You knew he was here?

635
01:22:53,073 --> 01:22:55,244
I heard talk, and I know you.

636
01:22:56,209 --> 01:22:58,510
You wouldn't give up on a patient.

637
01:22:58,992 --> 01:23:02,735
I thought it might be traumatic for you.
I would have told you in time.

638
01:23:04,176 --> 01:23:07,405
- Forgive me.
- Of course.

639
01:23:13,679 --> 01:23:15,566
And to answer your question...

640
01:23:16,752 --> 01:23:18,442
he'll be at the dance.

641
01:23:18,607 --> 01:23:20,232
Unless you wish otherwise.

642
01:23:21,518 --> 01:23:23,492
Whatever you think is best.

643
01:23:30,125 --> 01:23:34,185
It might be useful for his recovery
to see you've moved on, as it were.

644
01:23:37,518 --> 01:23:39,045
You'll fail her.

645
01:23:39,950 --> 01:23:41,094
He did.

646
01:23:41,742 --> 01:23:42,821
I did.

647
01:23:43,278 --> 01:23:44,521
So will you.

648
01:23:44,621 --> 01:23:47,524
Perspective. We can work with that.

649
01:23:48,205 --> 01:23:49,318
Cleave...

650
01:23:52,684 --> 01:23:54,539
will you let me see her?

651
01:23:55,916 --> 01:23:57,061
Please.

652
01:24:02,827 --> 01:24:05,477
The hospital ball
might be an opportunity.

653
01:24:08,042 --> 01:24:09,864
Cooperate in your treatment...

654
01:24:10,986 --> 01:24:12,415
and we'll see.

655
01:24:48,807 --> 01:24:50,497
You look magnificent.

656
01:24:54,438 --> 01:24:56,642
You look very dashing yourself.

657
01:24:59,046 --> 01:25:00,801
I remember that dress.

658
01:25:01,925 --> 01:25:03,813
I'm amazed it still fits.

659
01:25:07,141 --> 01:25:10,371
- Will you dance with me later?
- That would be lovely.

660
01:26:40,350 --> 01:26:42,739
Stella, shall we?

661
01:26:51,612 --> 01:26:54,928
By the way, I went to fetch Edgar,
and he was asleep.

662
01:26:55,035 --> 01:26:57,013
I woke him and he said
that he'd changed his mind...

663
01:26:57,118 --> 01:26:58,940
and didn't want to come.

664
01:29:04,850 --> 01:29:08,079
Leave me alone.
