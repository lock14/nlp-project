1
00:00:27,504 --> 00:00:28,806
This is not a test.

2
00:00:37,975 --> 00:00:39,911
Are you Rogue?

3
00:00:43,157 --> 00:00:46,379
Guys, we're making a video for
Cliff and Sidney, what do they mean?

4
00:00:47,003 --> 00:00:49,996
You wanted a sale of the studio?
What a great wedding?

5
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:52,747
There you are.

6
00:00:53,998 --> 00:00:56,193
I hate you, Anderson.

7
00:00:56,626 --> 00:01:00,775
And we're all famous, not you
Remember your team's film school.

8
00:01:01,368 --> 00:01:02,952
Your days in town, brother.

9
00:01:08,135 --> 00:01:09,401
- Done.
- Here begins filming.

10
00:01:10,355 --> 00:01:11,305
Are you comfortable?

11
00:01:14,075 --> 00:01:15,441
There is no harm.

12
00:01:16,172 --> 00:01:19,491
Can I ask a question,
Mr. Cliff Anderson?

13
00:01:19,943 --> 00:01:21,307
- Yes.
- In the form of speech.

14
00:01:22,768 --> 00:01:25,179
Yes, Mrs. Sidney Anderson.

15
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:30,303
Before moving to Sydney
living in california.

16
00:01:30,609 --> 00:01:34,759
How did you get this scar?
"As he had not noticed?

17
00:01:34,953 --> 00:01:37,115
Not even be here if not
for me.

18
00:01:37,402 --> 00:01:40,656
Take it to the concert.
they are submitted.

19
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:43,165
I mean, who believe the tie?

20
00:01:43,415 --> 00:01:46,856
It's a long story behind ...

21
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:52,582
All my insecurities ...
not funny ...

22
00:01:52,919 --> 00:01:57,834
And they took me to the service
and I did quarterback.

23
00:01:57,905 --> 00:01:59,423
And certainly do not want to talk about it.

24
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,193
- Try again.
- Great.

25
00:02:04,128 --> 00:02:07,898
My brother beat me
when I was nine years.

26
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:12,086
- What?
- Tommy, the idiot, that of Michigan.

27
00:02:12,585 --> 00:02:14,615
- My brother married before me.
- Yes.

28
00:02:15,004 --> 00:02:17,713
I wonder how this happened.

29
00:02:17,921 --> 00:02:21,524
I came here for a chance
to do this again.

30
00:02:23,604 --> 00:02:26,016
Who was happy
I was at the wedding?

31
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:29,266
Sorry, was my brother, right?

32
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:33,469
I'm sorry, is that it has
as 60 siblings.

33
00:02:34,034 --> 00:02:37,321
They have one in Michigan and one in ...

34
00:02:39,316 --> 00:02:43,618
I want to tell you how much I love them
and wish them the best honeymoon.

35
00:02:44,216 --> 00:02:47,175
And make it unforgettable.
I love you guys.

36
00:02:48,504 --> 00:02:53,483
I think they will start their new life
with a great adventure.

37
00:03:02,842 --> 00:03:04,656
Good heavens, are you crazy?

38
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:06,132
The dodged.

39
00:03:08,549 --> 00:03:10,463
Mrs. Sidney Anderson ...

40
00:03:11,298 --> 00:03:13,362
Mrs. Sidney Anderson ...

41
00:03:14,186 --> 00:03:18,074
Is that we will test in January,
and I know that I disapprove.

42
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:20,614
Keep practicing.

43
00:03:23,687 --> 00:03:26,681
The perfect escape.

44
00:03:30,253 --> 00:03:31,834
Sign in here.

45
00:03:32,816 --> 00:03:36,453
Never seen so many trees.
hey, fílmame.

46
00:03:41,243 --> 00:03:42,411
hears.

47
00:03:43,898 --> 00:03:45,131
No kidding.

48
00:04:01,593 --> 00:04:04,040
Oh, well.

49
00:04:12,314 --> 00:04:14,063
Look, hikers.

50
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:15,358
- Hello.
- Hello.

51
00:04:17,971 --> 00:04:22,371
Hey, I want to do that,
walk along that path.

52
00:04:22,565 --> 00:04:24,760
You can do it during the day.

53
00:04:25,508 --> 00:04:26,927
I'll show you what it is.

54
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,967
The most beautiful corner that made god.

55
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:42,956
Wow. Let me go here
and forget about the walk.

56
00:04:43,256 --> 00:04:49,993
This place is reached on foot or by kayak,
That's what makes it so special.

57
00:05:31,688 --> 00:05:34,878
It's beautiful.
How many days do you want?

58
00:05:35,248 --> 00:05:37,892
One day staying, one on the beach
and then returned.

59
00:05:38,659 --> 00:05:40,274
Typical error.

60
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:41,983
Will I need more?

61
00:05:42,186 --> 00:05:44,054
It's what you need but
you'll want more.

62
00:05:44,472 --> 00:05:46,632
I do not know if their licenses are up to date
so ...

63
00:05:46,885 --> 00:05:48,796
- Yeah, yeah, see.
- Well, yes.

64
00:05:49,278 --> 00:05:52,947
Because if you go and you can not leave
The path, you should have it.

65
00:05:53,322 --> 00:05:54,621
Agreed.

66
00:05:57,806 --> 00:05:58,842
Hi, honey.

67
00:05:58,972 --> 00:06:00,555
Three days I look pretty.

68
00:06:06,092 --> 00:06:08,386
Nine minutes.

69
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:14,026
Do you realize that time is
were apart from getting married?

70
00:06:14,386 --> 00:06:17,608
- 11.5 miles round trip, right?
- Yes.

71
00:06:19,073 --> 00:06:20,591
- Are you listening?
- What?

72
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:25,794
I will train in the car.
I'm excited.

73
00:06:27,468 --> 00:06:29,881
Well, listen, Cliff.

74
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,919
You have to go through five valleys ...

75
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:35,514
And always a thousand feet high.

76
00:06:35,869 --> 00:06:37,070
Be careful.

77
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,943
- Y or miss you too, honey.
- What?

78
00:06:39,809 --> 00:06:42,614
- What? Did you go anywhere?
- You are so wrong.

79
00:06:42,991 --> 00:06:44,955
$ 75.35

80
00:06:46,284 --> 00:06:48,445
Yeah, I know, seems to rob a bank.

81
00:06:48,619 --> 00:06:50,017
We honeymoon.

82
00:06:50,752 --> 00:06:52,564
- That so, mother.
- Salim.

83
00:06:53,103 --> 00:06:55,201
- Good to go home.
- My child.

84
00:06:55,349 --> 00:06:56,832
Good to see you later
so long.

85
00:06:57,487 --> 00:06:59,419
Only a few days I went.

86
00:07:03,809 --> 00:07:05,743
Maybe not now.

87
00:07:05,966 --> 00:07:07,681
Can you take the car?

88
00:07:08,008 --> 00:07:09,691
If I do one thing and
return immediately.

89
00:07:10,593 --> 00:07:12,439
The boy's help
with your luggage.

90
00:07:14,384 --> 00:07:16,065
- Aloha.
- Aloha.

91
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:19,206
- Have to go, brother.
- Yes, I will.

92
00:07:26,574 --> 00:07:28,703
Young Couple massacred in Honolulu.

93
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:06,064
Hello.

94
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:12,701
What are you doing?

95
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:15,185
It's Hawaii.

96
00:08:18,384 --> 00:08:20,766
Just because we're in Hawaii
things you usually do not ...

97
00:08:20,951 --> 00:08:23,081
As people gather
requesting rides.

98
00:08:23,254 --> 00:08:25,801
Nothing bad ever happens in Hawaii, right?

99
00:08:30,721 --> 00:08:32,654
- Ohalo.
- Aloha.

100
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:35,618
- How far can they go?
- Beach Dumahi.

101
00:08:35,902 --> 00:08:38,829
Dumahi, Dumahi ... I think not
know the area.

102
00:08:39,229 --> 00:08:42,157
It's 10 miles as the crow flies,
not this way ...

103
00:08:42,348 --> 00:08:44,510
On the trail to the beach,
Do you know this path?

104
00:08:44,673 --> 00:08:46,192
Yeah, the great path?

105
00:08:51,453 --> 00:08:53,779
Yes, but ... not going that far.

106
00:08:56,935 --> 00:08:58,550
And how far they go?

107
00:08:59,734 --> 00:09:04,267
Not until the end of this road,
so ...

108
00:09:04,427 --> 00:09:07,320
If they stay here for about 5 minutes,
I'm sure someone will be y. ..

109
00:09:07,492 --> 00:09:10,451
We have been here an hour
and nobody has stopped ...

110
00:09:10,584 --> 00:09:12,134
Maybe more.

111
00:09:12,395 --> 00:09:14,940
Shit, I thought
we were in Hawaii.

112
00:09:16,913 --> 00:09:17,831
Come on.

113
00:09:20,558 --> 00:09:23,037
- Are you married?
- Yes, yes, we just get married.

114
00:09:23,917 --> 00:09:27,007
Look, some of these pictures
are very bad.

115
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:29,500
Are with those disposable cameras.

116
00:09:29,662 --> 00:09:31,059
- This ...
- What are you doing?

117
00:09:31,268 --> 00:09:32,984
- These people do not want to see this.
- Agreed.

118
00:09:35,356 --> 00:09:38,129
That's us in Bahu.

119
00:09:38,359 --> 00:09:39,943
- Wow.
- We woke up one morning ...

120
00:09:40,175 --> 00:09:41,473
And decided to get married.

121
00:09:41,635 --> 00:09:43,666
- Is nice, no?
- Yes, adorable.

122
00:09:45,605 --> 00:09:49,081
- Wait ... "This is a market?
- Paolo's store.

123
00:09:49,434 --> 00:09:51,148
This is you very well.

124
00:09:52,033 --> 00:09:55,953
Paolo said I should throw that photo.

125
00:09:56,636 --> 00:09:59,826
I know it seems a pretty bad taste,
but they are pretty nice ...

126
00:10:00,027 --> 00:10:01,991
The radishes and stuff.

127
00:10:02,248 --> 00:10:03,962
Oh, yes, weird.

128
00:10:04,522 --> 00:10:07,711
I think it's great
married in Bahu.

129
00:10:09,282 --> 00:10:11,344
If, as to frame it.

130
00:10:15,523 --> 00:10:17,456
You know what? we're going to bring.

131
00:10:18,069 --> 00:10:19,686
Miles y. ..

132
00:10:20,141 --> 00:10:21,408
We're coming.

133
00:10:21,775 --> 00:10:22,976
Maybe for the next.

134
00:10:24,973 --> 00:10:26,686
Come on, Kale, do not be so.

135
00:10:26,808 --> 00:10:27,847
Baby, come on.

136
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:30,805
Guys, do not make much fuss
this.

137
00:10:30,966 --> 00:10:32,965
! Out of the car like this, dammit!

138
00:10:53,946 --> 00:10:56,841
I think we handle it very well.

139
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,499
Kalalau Trail,
11 miles

140
00:11:04,674 --> 00:11:07,087
We will go along that path.

141
00:11:09,092 --> 00:11:13,655
How to pull this? these new things
have too many buttons for me.

142
00:11:13,786 --> 00:11:15,947
Yes, I like to buy the best.

143
00:11:16,266 --> 00:11:19,904
In fact it was today that I read the manual.

144
00:11:20,115 --> 00:11:21,829
- What was that?
- Thanks.

145
00:11:47,721 --> 00:11:48,824
Well.

146
00:11:49,585 --> 00:11:51,401
I guess nobody saw it.

147
00:11:52,154 --> 00:11:53,769
Really?

148
00:11:55,126 --> 00:11:56,809
We show you, never fear.

149
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:00,439
Do you think the rest disappeared?

150
00:12:01,165 --> 00:12:02,058
Look at me.

151
00:12:02,724 --> 00:12:04,022
Do not forget to look down
and move fast.

152
00:12:04,418 --> 00:12:05,838
Keep off green rocks.

153
00:12:07,362 --> 00:12:08,595
That's it.

154
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,485
Well, that seems easy.

155
00:12:12,853 --> 00:12:16,742
Yes, because he has all the equipment
camping in his back.

156
00:12:18,132 --> 00:12:18,895
Well.

157
00:12:19,735 --> 00:12:21,864
- Go get him, baby.
- Okay, okay.

158
00:12:22,767 --> 00:12:24,251
Oh, my God.

159
00:12:26,527 --> 00:12:27,630
- Done.
- Thanks.

160
00:12:29,296 --> 00:12:30,881
You did very well.

161
00:12:32,009 --> 00:12:33,624
Come on, baby, you can.

162
00:12:49,934 --> 00:12:51,387
Impressive.

163
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:54,896
- That fear.
- Come here, come here.

164
00:12:55,505 --> 00:12:56,989
Are you okay?

165
00:12:57,723 --> 00:13:01,513
- I'm fine.
- Yes, my God.

166
00:13:02,452 --> 00:13:04,549
Hey, what's your name?

167
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:13,085
Have we already know? when
I saw I had a little Deja Vu.

168
00:13:13,998 --> 00:13:15,714
No, no, I remember.

169
00:13:17,238 --> 00:13:18,570
Please.

170
00:13:20,045 --> 00:13:22,172
- Are you an actor?
- No, no.

171
00:13:22,984 --> 00:13:24,382
I've seen on television.

172
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:26,455
No, not true.

173
00:13:26,635 --> 00:13:28,697
In fact, fifteen is a screenwriter.

174
00:13:29,115 --> 00:13:32,885
After all, the major studios
want to shoot their projects.

175
00:13:33,058 --> 00:13:34,804
I smelled your fame and fortune.

176
00:13:35,043 --> 00:13:36,561
So writer scripts?

177
00:13:36,677 --> 00:13:37,976
You could simply say "writer."

178
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:39,758
Any film that I know?

179
00:13:40,245 --> 00:13:45,640
In fact ... my ... first script is
In pre-production right now ...

180
00:13:45,937 --> 00:13:48,031
So I must leave this
Same time the next year.

181
00:13:49,113 --> 00:13:50,477
Who acts?

182
00:13:51,707 --> 00:13:53,966
I'm still deciding,
They are making the selection of players.

183
00:13:54,186 --> 00:13:58,589
Nic Cage is putting money
in my script.

184
00:13:59,379 --> 00:14:01,606
Have a dramatic turn?

185
00:14:02,549 --> 00:14:03,314
Yes, yes.

186
00:14:04,975 --> 00:14:06,821
"And you're
in this business, Nic?

187
00:14:07,482 --> 00:14:11,500
Me? not only spend a few courses,
one of these camps in literature.

188
00:14:12,033 --> 00:14:14,741
I had so many unusual experience
In my life I thought about ...

189
00:14:15,008 --> 00:14:18,776
Everything on paper and translate it
earn a million dollars.

190
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,309
But it is not so easy, why not?

191
00:14:21,711 --> 00:14:23,109
But I liked a lot.

192
00:14:23,986 --> 00:14:25,951
In fact I'm writing a few pages.

193
00:14:26,668 --> 00:14:31,267
Essentially there are three acts, a trip
and people at risk ...

194
00:14:32,785 --> 00:14:34,751
At risk?

195
00:14:35,767 --> 00:14:39,536
Simply include a character
to attack the view ...

196
00:14:39,732 --> 00:14:43,401
It is a heroine, a heroine.

197
00:14:44,571 --> 00:14:47,827
I'm pretty sure
at risk.

198
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:51,854
Then these halfway
of fame, do not you, Cliff?

199
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:54,182
- Something like that.
- Impressive.

200
00:14:54,403 --> 00:14:56,978
Yes, a great team ready
in Vancouver ...

201
00:14:57,346 --> 00:14:59,443
Preparing the scenery and stuff.

202
00:14:59,569 --> 00:15:01,951
But they are there
and you here.

203
00:15:03,366 --> 00:15:09,537
Yes, yes, it is difficult to explain, but
brought to another to ...

204
00:15:09,691 --> 00:15:10,989
make a new version quickly.

205
00:15:11,122 --> 00:15:13,502
- A new story?
- If a function of just two weeks.

206
00:15:13,778 --> 00:15:16,771
- It's commonplace.
- What does all was that?

207
00:15:19,696 --> 00:15:21,147
Nine weeks.

208
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:25,724
Well, that's good fucking,
Is your vision, Cliff, your creature.

209
00:15:26,305 --> 00:15:28,217
Do not let them get away with that.

210
00:15:28,838 --> 00:15:32,180
He has never defended agents and
or anything like that.

211
00:15:32,521 --> 00:15:33,852
The other day I said to Cliff that ...

212
00:15:33,948 --> 00:15:37,899
What I like is about me,
but we can do something else for a while.

213
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:41,697
Well, here's another little tip.

214
00:15:41,937 --> 00:15:44,485
Find yourself a new agent and
Find yourself a new story.

215
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,398
To you too.

216
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:52,601
I have one.

217
00:15:52,882 --> 00:15:54,849
Wait a minute, listen.

218
00:15:55,564 --> 00:15:57,344
This has the worst reception of the world.

219
00:15:58,281 --> 00:16:00,213
Did you hear about what happened in Bahu?

220
00:16:00,672 --> 00:16:01,808
What? What happened?

221
00:16:01,954 --> 00:16:05,526
My dad called. reception
is a mess here ...

222
00:16:05,866 --> 00:16:08,989
But he said something about bandits.

223
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,476
Is welcome.

224
00:16:15,222 --> 00:16:18,509
- Is that it?
- It comes and goes. hardly any.

225
00:16:18,664 --> 00:16:19,635
Is it in Honolulu?

226
00:16:19,893 --> 00:16:22,853
Pope wants us to go. I
you are overreacting.

227
00:16:23,075 --> 00:16:26,033
This in the news, kill others.

228
00:16:26,265 --> 00:16:29,869
Well, that's terrible.

229
00:16:30,032 --> 00:16:31,877
We spent the day before yesterday.

230
00:16:32,073 --> 00:16:34,204
We like five months
and a half planning this.

231
00:16:34,384 --> 00:16:35,967
Does not even know that was
on another island?

232
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,245
What ... that ... your dad told you?

233
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:40,112
You know who did it? You know what?

234
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:44,722
No, says looking for two people,
a man and a woman. and that's all.

235
00:16:45,468 --> 00:16:46,889
Is she like that movie, right?

236
00:16:47,568 --> 00:16:49,414
Murderers Natos

237
00:16:49,756 --> 00:16:51,667
That movie scares me.

238
00:16:52,037 --> 00:16:53,522
- Do you remember?
- Vaguely.

239
00:16:56,145 --> 00:16:57,695
What do you think?

240
00:16:58,448 --> 00:17:00,546
Well, we're here.

241
00:17:00,957 --> 00:17:03,022
Speak now or forever.

242
00:17:06,355 --> 00:17:09,065
Continuing, it is our honeymoon, no.

243
00:17:20,549 --> 00:17:22,580
We're here.

244
00:17:23,055 --> 00:17:25,983
Be careful.
The hard part is to come.

245
00:17:26,904 --> 00:17:28,169
Yes?

246
00:17:28,452 --> 00:17:30,647
Is the path to the falls?

247
00:17:32,475 --> 00:17:34,768
I read in the guide.

248
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:40,334
It is only during the day I
to return to drag.

249
00:17:41,044 --> 00:17:43,423
How far is

250
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:46,846
It's like anything in life,
how far we have to be.

251
00:17:47,255 --> 00:17:49,221
Nene, sounds so romantic.

252
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:51,668
Yes, I want to go to the beach, but ...

253
00:17:51,887 --> 00:17:53,917
- How much? "A mile?
- Come on.

254
00:17:54,108 --> 00:17:56,304
Maybe we should leave the man.

255
00:17:57,666 --> 00:18:00,342
Do not worry about me,
It's easy enough to return.

256
00:18:10,579 --> 00:18:12,576
- What?
- Nothing.

257
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:16,173
"Only a mile?

258
00:18:17,316 --> 00:18:19,249
Yes! Just got!

259
00:18:19,895 --> 00:18:21,162
Hey, wait.

260
00:18:49,974 --> 00:18:51,394
Go!

261
00:18:52,045 --> 00:18:55,582
Well, I think with the
there is nothing to do.

262
00:18:57,233 --> 00:18:58,466
Look at that.

263
00:18:59,246 --> 00:19:00,828
I can not believe it's true.

264
00:19:10,491 --> 00:19:11,887
Cristina.

265
00:19:12,909 --> 00:19:14,841
Do you know?

266
00:19:15,503 --> 00:19:17,863
She as crazy as me.

267
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:21,476
- Now.
- Okay.

268
00:19:22,499 --> 00:19:24,977
Are they a couple?

269
00:19:28,242 --> 00:19:30,339
Will you go or what?

270
00:19:30,925 --> 00:19:33,503
Baby, let's go.

271
00:19:33,905 --> 00:19:37,159
Yes, but let me see if reception here.

272
00:19:38,657 --> 00:19:40,208
Agreed.

273
00:19:54,128 --> 00:19:55,908
That nice.

274
00:19:59,113 --> 00:20:03,066
We hope not to interrupt
in your paradise.

275
00:20:03,649 --> 00:20:07,022
Forget it, Nick always brings lost people.

276
00:20:08,867 --> 00:20:11,795
I'm Mrs. Sidney.
We are newlyweds.

277
00:20:12,015 --> 00:20:14,757
Ms. Gine Scribes.
we do not.

278
00:20:46,563 --> 00:20:48,113
Here we go.

279
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:56,744
It just honeymoon in Honolulu.

280
00:20:57,035 --> 00:21:00,323
... Bahu Island, possibly
on their honeymoon.

281
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,505
teeth removed
and fingerprints.

282
00:21:05,034 --> 00:21:07,960
There is reason to believe that the
murderers may have happened ...

283
00:21:08,748 --> 00:21:10,200
the island of Kalalau.

284
00:21:15,729 --> 00:21:18,656
- Are you kidding?
- No, these girls told us on the path.

285
00:21:20,185 --> 00:21:24,039
Do you see?
Do you know who are the murderers?

286
00:21:24,727 --> 00:21:26,592
I think not.

287
00:21:36,298 --> 00:21:39,619
Security cameras showed
photos of the suspects.

288
00:21:49,502 --> 00:21:53,969
I heard that several people die
above annually.

289
00:21:54,163 --> 00:21:58,053
They stand under the waterfall
the falling stone strikes a ...

290
00:21:58,248 --> 00:22:01,724
Or simply slip,
roll down and disappear.

291
00:22:04,111 --> 00:22:05,890
Bad, right?

292
00:22:06,855 --> 00:22:09,215
Could be worse.

293
00:22:12,226 --> 00:22:14,072
How are you going?

294
00:22:15,198 --> 00:22:17,164
I'm fine.

295
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:23,328
Two accidents in one day,
What for you is natural, right?

296
00:22:26,364 --> 00:22:28,658
We're being followed, Kale

297
00:22:30,367 --> 00:22:32,736
The point is that we cheated

298
00:22:33,697 --> 00:22:35,511
Every man has a share
lie in his life.

299
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:41,186
I just thought we were
foolish enough to believe you.

300
00:22:42,898 --> 00:22:45,160
- Sorry, I ...
- What did you think?

301
00:22:45,411 --> 00:22:48,817
Just for how we see,
What did you think we are?

302
00:22:49,557 --> 00:22:51,851
- Outlaws?
- No, do not judge.

303
00:22:52,008 --> 00:22:57,764
Wherever I go, the world
I spits in the face.

304
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,356
Excuse me.

305
00:23:03,669 --> 00:23:04,837
What?

306
00:23:05,828 --> 00:23:07,795
I thought they said they would
Dumahi beach.

307
00:23:07,999 --> 00:23:11,025
We said we were going to that area.

308
00:23:11,177 --> 00:23:13,723
They said they would come by the
path, so ...

309
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,619
You either.

310
00:23:16,525 --> 00:23:21,025
Look, I offered to bring them.
did not want, did not accept.

311
00:23:21,538 --> 00:23:24,344
So I do not understand what the problem.

312
00:23:25,852 --> 00:23:27,274
Kale.

313
00:23:32,123 --> 00:23:34,088
Is this all in harmony here?

314
00:23:34,977 --> 00:23:36,593
I think we're okay.

315
00:23:38,476 --> 00:23:39,743
Impressive.

316
00:23:42,067 --> 00:23:44,939
- How far are you going?
- Bahu Island.

317
00:23:45,605 --> 00:23:48,413
- Do you?
- On the beach next door ...

318
00:23:48,578 --> 00:23:51,056
- What is his name?
- Hanakapai.

319
00:23:52,081 --> 00:23:54,242
At that or maybe farther.

320
00:23:54,411 --> 00:23:56,322
Need permits to go further.

321
00:24:00,476 --> 00:24:02,289
You should give us a ride.

322
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:04,815
Come on.

323
00:24:14,478 --> 00:24:17,025
So after spending 45
taxi dollars ...

324
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:19,927
went to the hotel overlooking the sea.
- Sounds good.

325
00:24:20,837 --> 00:24:25,084
The problem is that in reality
no sea view.

326
00:24:28,996 --> 00:24:31,539
And David said to me:
* This is great *.

327
00:24:39,985 --> 00:24:42,628
- Is everything all right?
- Yes, use the time.

328
00:24:43,134 --> 00:24:46,967
- Yes, but these two are who I think?
- If, say they will go down the path.

329
00:24:47,718 --> 00:24:50,525
- Shit.
- It's 1:30. let's go.

330
00:24:53,665 --> 00:24:57,521
Honey, can you remove this?
I do not know.

331
00:24:58,213 --> 00:25:00,278
- Agreed.
- Thanks.

332
00:25:02,411 --> 00:25:04,572
Would you mind if we were
with you?

333
00:25:05,065 --> 00:25:06,648
We're all going the same route.

334
00:25:07,993 --> 00:25:09,510
On my right.

335
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,455
Yes, of course.

336
00:25:14,874 --> 00:25:16,205
"You took the permit?

337
00:25:16,332 --> 00:25:17,598
No.

338
00:25:17,996 --> 00:25:19,548
I put in this pocket.

339
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:23,144
You lost it?

340
00:25:24,458 --> 00:25:26,937
No, I'm pretty sure ...
no, I'm sure ...

341
00:25:27,381 --> 00:25:28,549
Crap.

342
00:25:49,937 --> 00:25:52,483
Ernesto Padilla
probation officer

343
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:54,948
Hurry, Cliff.

344
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,696
If a second.

345
00:26:05,123 --> 00:26:07,863
We leave no man behind
in the hard part.

346
00:26:25,094 --> 00:26:28,054
"Here no one is lost, no?

347
00:26:39,114 --> 00:26:41,474
Did you know that Cliff is
a major writer?

348
00:26:42,467 --> 00:26:46,235
Do you write for the movies?
! go that well!

349
00:26:46,871 --> 00:26:49,581
It is preparing to
a new history.

350
00:26:50,078 --> 00:26:52,950
She can not tell you anything, even
had heard of Honolulu.

351
00:26:53,081 --> 00:26:55,080
- Now you be careful.
- What?

352
00:26:55,671 --> 00:26:57,482
You know why.

353
00:26:57,804 --> 00:27:00,895
Maybe Cliff can change the names
to protect the guilty.

354
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:04,205
- Do you do it in the movies?
- Do you know Johnny Depp?

355
00:27:04,511 --> 00:27:06,891
Do you know Nic Cage
Do we imagine working together?

356
00:27:07,054 --> 00:27:10,011
- Do you know Nic Cage?
- Yes, I know.

357
00:27:10,639 --> 00:27:15,205
I prefer Johnny Depp,
is a dream.

358
00:27:15,685 --> 00:27:17,649
You know that part of living here?

359
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,768
My God! dear all
begins with the story.

360
00:27:21,053 --> 00:27:22,669
- Is not that right, Cliff?
- Yes.

361
00:27:23,414 --> 00:27:26,307
I once made a surprise visit to
palace of a dictator in the river Tigris.

362
00:27:26,942 --> 00:27:30,678
They had finished evacuating,
still smelled of cigars.

363
00:27:30,761 --> 00:27:35,293
It was very difficult to find a villager
to say who had done that.

364
00:27:35,433 --> 00:27:39,617
But in the master bathroom, which by the way,
is the hallmark of Ethiopia, ...

365
00:27:40,605 --> 00:27:46,033
There was a box built to the ground.

366
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:47,906
We started to hit
the damn lock.

367
00:27:48,084 --> 00:27:49,767
Were you in Iraq?

368
00:27:50,069 --> 00:27:52,746
Yes, yes, my team and myself.

369
00:27:53,248 --> 00:27:55,925
What you saw those fucking
photos, it was after.

370
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:58,476
What I'm saying
Now it's true.

371
00:27:59,457 --> 00:28:01,107
They should be talking about it.

372
00:28:01,874 --> 00:28:05,796
So I thought inside the box
open money ...

373
00:28:06,425 --> 00:28:08,904
Perhaps some guns, ...

374
00:28:09,347 --> 00:28:12,754
Or maybe some presidential grave.

375
00:28:13,055 --> 00:28:16,398
Finally we opened.

376
00:28:17,079 --> 00:28:22,606
We made it explode.

377
00:28:23,967 --> 00:28:26,032
"Mortal, no?

378
00:28:26,227 --> 00:28:27,714
Do you like the details,
not, Cliff?

379
00:28:27,981 --> 00:28:29,728
Maybe you can make another peliculón.

380
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:33,459
- And we find when we opened it?
- What was found?

381
00:28:34,222 --> 00:28:38,141
Avengers, the guy was a phenomenon.

382
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:40,292
And you know what she had,
in his personal reserve?

383
00:28:40,654 --> 00:28:42,271
No, Nic, I was not there.

384
00:28:50,641 --> 00:28:52,323
It is material for a job.

385
00:28:52,537 --> 00:28:56,041
Mr. President had a predilection
by Francophones, small and large.

386
00:28:56,587 --> 00:28:57,922
I tell you.

387
00:29:04,144 --> 00:29:07,071
You were special forces?

388
00:29:07,966 --> 00:29:10,095
Infantry troops
assault, what?

389
00:29:11,874 --> 00:29:14,746
Officially only allows me to
say I am officially ...

390
00:29:14,897 --> 00:29:17,375
Acting on stage tactics
of certain missions ...

391
00:29:17,553 --> 00:29:20,960
And I went crazy.

392
00:29:22,188 --> 00:29:23,804
And unofficially?

393
00:29:25,367 --> 00:29:27,300
I'm a fucking American Jedi.

394
00:29:29,199 --> 00:29:31,131
By the way, is a possible title.

395
00:29:36,016 --> 00:29:37,088
You see this?

396
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:45,236
A fragment of a mine
mines.

397
00:29:45,964 --> 00:29:49,434
I enter through the back
my fucking head.

398
00:29:52,053 --> 00:29:56,237
Return, I reconstructed the skull
with titanium.

399
00:29:57,011 --> 00:29:59,837
I can not pass through a detector
without sounding metal, but okay ...

400
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:02,690
It allows me to travel with Guilligan
without noticing.

401
00:30:03,867 --> 00:30:05,352
"Guilligan?

402
00:30:10,572 --> 00:30:11,936
My companion.

403
00:30:16,284 --> 00:30:17,999
Now that sounds.

404
00:30:18,209 --> 00:30:19,694
But listen.

405
00:30:20,076 --> 00:30:23,451
When I enter this drill,
not even felt it.

406
00:30:23,873 --> 00:30:28,055
So, I felt the impact and that I
licked his back, but no pain.

407
00:30:28,506 --> 00:30:33,423
I would have stayed with that put
there, but I had this.

408
00:30:34,016 --> 00:30:38,712
My colleagues swear that I
17 minutes walk ...

409
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:41,937
Before I was forced to lie.

410
00:30:42,647 --> 00:30:45,965
And even after that I could go
by my own feet.

411
00:30:47,805 --> 00:30:50,187
All in the mind, Cliff.

412
00:30:51,809 --> 00:30:54,997
Remember that when writing
a scene.

413
00:30:55,566 --> 00:30:59,140
Yes, very good details on that.

414
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:02,686
He is really very hard to kill.

415
00:31:17,462 --> 00:31:19,820
Hey, you get to the beach?

416
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:21,363
Sure, continuous.

417
00:31:26,237 --> 00:31:29,230
- Hey, I see that you did.
- Yes.

418
00:31:29,772 --> 00:31:34,685
- Are there some three miles to the beach?
- Yes, but the path is complicated.

419
00:31:37,248 --> 00:31:41,495
Hey, the more we move,
less people are in the path.

420
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:43,837
What do you mean?

421
00:31:49,173 --> 00:31:51,555
See you back there,
pretend that you have to urinate.

422
00:31:52,761 --> 00:31:54,180
Well.

423
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:02,164
Police made public this photo
of the murderers.

424
00:32:02,955 --> 00:32:04,866
Apparently unaware that
were being filmed.

425
00:32:10,805 --> 00:32:12,321
- Shit.
- What?

426
00:32:18,948 --> 00:32:20,564
It could be anyone.

427
00:32:20,817 --> 00:32:22,499
Are you sure?

428
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:25,018
Does not it look familiar?

429
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:28,162
Are you okay?

430
00:32:28,575 --> 00:32:30,574
We are in the bathroom.

431
00:32:32,862 --> 00:32:34,445
You're scaring me.

432
00:32:34,673 --> 00:32:36,321
It can be anyone.

433
00:32:37,621 --> 00:32:41,094
We know these people
addition to their stories ...

434
00:32:41,469 --> 00:32:44,944
That, besides, I begin to seem
increasingly lie.

435
00:32:45,172 --> 00:32:48,580
The next thing we'll hear what
he has the heart of a baboon.

436
00:32:48,846 --> 00:32:52,222
Just try to impress
write a movie ...

437
00:32:52,436 --> 00:32:53,921
About his life or something.

438
00:32:54,598 --> 00:32:56,468
What do we know?

439
00:32:58,070 --> 00:33:00,964
She is from Savannah, the son of
a military driver ...

440
00:33:01,189 --> 00:33:03,286
She revealed, met Nic Carolina
south, but it reminded ...

441
00:33:03,465 --> 00:33:06,107
Too much to his dad, he chased
and convinced her to move in with him ...

442
00:33:06,354 --> 00:33:09,478
Of course I became interested in it;
is the first time you are in Hawaii ...

443
00:33:09,683 --> 00:33:14,664
They thought about going to Las Vegas, but
They loved this because it is quiet.

444
00:33:18,968 --> 00:33:20,966
But there were also in Bahu.

445
00:33:24,242 --> 00:33:25,858
If.

446
00:33:38,991 --> 00:33:40,706
Cliff is an interesting guy.

447
00:33:41,208 --> 00:33:45,708
Yes, this is the first man who wants
talk while in the bathroom.

448
00:33:46,923 --> 00:33:48,602
What is going on there?

449
00:33:50,885 --> 00:33:54,042
Shake that bush to learn
they are there.

450
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:55,886
Shake that bush.

451
00:34:03,273 --> 00:34:06,167
Warning: danger of flooding.

452
00:34:11,930 --> 00:34:13,960
We're supposed to in our
honeymoon ...

453
00:34:14,611 --> 00:34:20,171
So control your brain overexcited
because I want to have fun.

454
00:34:21,636 --> 00:34:23,898
Nene, we will be fine.

455
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:37,629
I guess we'll be there tomorrow.

456
00:34:38,164 --> 00:34:39,300
I hope so.

457
00:34:41,314 --> 00:34:42,450
- Shit.
- You do very well, baby.

458
00:34:42,802 --> 00:34:44,352
Wow, amazing.

459
00:34:44,754 --> 00:34:45,857
If.

460
00:34:46,041 --> 00:34:52,492
Well, we have macaroni and cheese
with genuine imitation cheese.

461
00:34:53,407 --> 00:34:55,853
Honey, that are mashed vegetables.

462
00:35:13,606 --> 00:35:16,597
Reflexes.
going for a walk.

463
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:49,222
What?

464
00:35:50,208 --> 00:35:51,312
What do you do?

465
00:35:51,432 --> 00:35:53,627
What do you mean by that?
That they are watching?

466
00:35:55,517 --> 00:35:57,548
Whatever you're looking at.

467
00:36:02,976 --> 00:36:05,871
It was probably only a goat,
There are many in this valley.

468
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:14,247
I have not seen any goat.

469
00:36:15,051 --> 00:36:16,862
I hope you do not, Cliff.

470
00:36:17,701 --> 00:36:21,044
Your awareness of the situation
is rather poor.

471
00:36:22,092 --> 00:36:24,604
You're a writer, I am a Jedi.

472
00:36:25,047 --> 00:36:27,372
It is clearly not beyond me.

473
00:36:29,132 --> 00:36:31,165
Kill yourself ...

474
00:36:32,109 --> 00:36:34,075
Or just drown you?

475
00:36:35,406 --> 00:36:38,115
- I just wonder.
- No, I'm fine.

476
00:36:38,468 --> 00:36:44,345
I do not know if offended or not, determines
"situational awareness".

477
00:36:45,406 --> 00:36:47,504
What is the first thing you do
when you get on a plane?

478
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:51,330
Maybe take a good champagne, eh?

479
00:36:52,749 --> 00:36:54,267
Do you travel first class, no?

480
00:36:55,516 --> 00:36:57,780
I go on, like everyone else.

481
00:37:00,938 --> 00:37:06,204
Well, when I take a plane,
I look at everything.

482
00:37:06,653 --> 00:37:08,019
I look at the doors.

483
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:11,848
I count the steps until Entries
which gave access to my seat.

484
00:37:12,156 --> 00:37:14,087
If the plane loses power during
take-off, ...

485
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:17,691
I find the way in
darkness, blindly.

486
00:37:22,682 --> 00:37:26,221
And I know that the door opens to
inward, not outward.

487
00:37:26,649 --> 00:37:29,839
And I know all this in 30 seconds
even before ...

488
00:37:30,007 --> 00:37:31,458
Uncork the bottle for you ...

489
00:37:31,845 --> 00:37:33,495
first class.

490
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:39,025
Look, if you wait until there is a
emergency to decide what to do ...

491
00:37:40,038 --> 00:37:41,490
You are dead.

492
00:37:45,386 --> 00:37:48,474
- But it never passes.
- It happened in City Sue.

493
00:37:49,144 --> 00:37:51,054
- Sue City?
- DC 10.

494
00:37:51,397 --> 00:37:53,777
He took four rounds when he landed.

495
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:57,144
He finished in a cornfield.
112 people died.

496
00:37:57,511 --> 00:37:59,806
If I remember it said
on television.

497
00:38:00,109 --> 00:38:02,881
Yes, I saw it from within.

498
00:38:04,043 --> 00:38:06,621
The really is hard to kill.

499
00:38:12,352 --> 00:38:13,618
Come on.

500
00:38:15,238 --> 00:38:17,785
Hey, are you gonna do with that?

501
00:38:18,039 --> 00:38:19,305
The food.

502
00:38:19,701 --> 00:38:23,490
- Come on.
- I'd love to, but thanks.

503
00:38:24,684 --> 00:38:27,741
Kitty, kitty going.

504
00:38:31,625 --> 00:38:32,991
Excuse me?

505
00:38:34,253 --> 00:38:37,924
No problem. if you want to stay
in the kitchen with the women, do it.

506
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:43,226
Hey, I'm an adult, so that
call me kitten ...

507
00:38:43,437 --> 00:38:45,730
It has no effect.

508
00:39:06,319 --> 00:39:09,246
You know? I step through the mind ...

509
00:39:10,764 --> 00:39:17,285
What happened to you my mind that
we, Gina and I ...

510
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:20,213
Those who ...

511
00:39:20,451 --> 00:39:23,158
Okay, Cliff, your mind of screenwriter
works too, ...

512
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:26,809
He sees ghosts in every corner.

513
00:39:27,618 --> 00:39:30,325
What? the murderers

514
00:39:30,871 --> 00:39:33,644
The fellow travelers.

515
00:39:34,231 --> 00:39:39,111
- Another possible title.
- I think your mind plays tricks on you.

516
00:39:39,362 --> 00:39:42,190
So you think it's a coincidence
we were in Bahu?

517
00:39:42,224 --> 00:39:43,457
Sidney and I were there.

518
00:39:43,703 --> 00:39:46,279
There were many people in Bahu
when the murders occurred.

519
00:39:46,675 --> 00:39:48,675
So I see it, Nic.

520
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:50,347
Well.

521
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,693
Well, you've tangled rotation amount
dramatic second act.

522
00:39:59,693 --> 00:40:02,140
Are not we chasing goats, do you?

523
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:04,628
No.

524
00:40:06,101 --> 00:40:09,289
Would you mind telling me
hell are we doing here?

525
00:40:09,538 --> 00:40:11,668
Someone is doing shadow
two people.

526
00:40:11,811 --> 00:40:14,705
I do not know if they are hostile, but
if they come to our camp ...

527
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,969
We'll take care of them.

528
00:40:17,347 --> 00:40:21,783
Are here.
I know, you did not see.

529
00:40:22,566 --> 00:40:24,925
- "People of the excursions?
- No, someone else.

530
00:40:25,043 --> 00:40:28,002
- We must return.
- Gine knows care.

531
00:40:29,328 --> 00:40:30,978
He spoke of Sydney.

532
00:40:32,416 --> 00:40:33,965
Gine can also look after her.

533
00:40:34,759 --> 00:40:37,140
Are you fucking, Nic?

534
00:40:37,264 --> 00:40:40,071
If I were the murderer,
I would not expect ...

535
00:40:40,703 --> 00:40:42,416
kill here.

536
00:40:45,594 --> 00:40:47,177
Wait.

537
00:40:47,284 --> 00:40:51,816
Please, the guys are happy.

538
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:55,981
It also gives us much time together.

539
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:03,719
Oh, no, not my thing.

540
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:12,402
What is yours?
I still have not heard.

541
00:41:14,025 --> 00:41:16,406
It might seem very boring.

542
00:41:16,676 --> 00:41:18,391
Try me.

543
00:41:21,683 --> 00:41:25,769
Well, we have been striving
much for me to get pregnant.

544
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:31,057
We will have five children,
two males and three females, ...

545
00:41:31,911 --> 00:41:34,620
Of course
extremely beautiful.

546
00:41:35,061 --> 00:41:38,085
We want to buy a house ...

547
00:41:38,757 --> 00:41:43,160
Long walks in
summer with children ...

548
00:41:43,769 --> 00:41:48,467
And be ourselves,
a family.

549
00:41:49,497 --> 00:41:53,833
I guess I would be happy with that
Mama call me ...

550
00:41:54,564 --> 00:41:56,660
And Mrs. Sidney Anderson.

551
00:42:02,948 --> 00:42:08,279
There was a preacher in Georgia ...

552
00:42:08,423 --> 00:42:11,863
What I told the boys
that would burn in Hell ...

553
00:42:12,034 --> 00:42:15,800
For having extramarital sex
and then one day ...

554
00:42:16,381 --> 00:42:21,525
found him facing the wall
house with a prostitute.

555
00:42:23,864 --> 00:42:26,025
a prostitute
very large penis.

556
00:42:28,668 --> 00:42:32,720
if, then ...

557
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:37,589
I learned a long time
how perfect that men are.

558
00:42:39,908 --> 00:42:41,906
Do not believe them.

559
00:43:22,129 --> 00:43:23,202
Nic.

560
00:43:27,837 --> 00:43:30,314
He also lied about having had
a life of dreams.

561
00:43:30,835 --> 00:43:34,855
My parents began to lie
hair and parted.

562
00:43:35,903 --> 00:43:39,090
They decided that each could
stay with two children, ...

563
00:43:39,254 --> 00:43:42,280
But the problem was that
had five children.

564
00:43:43,124 --> 00:43:47,112
I was frustrated time
and frightened, ...

565
00:43:47,343 --> 00:43:51,496
Until I met a boy
named Rockie, a few years older.

566
00:43:53,995 --> 00:44:00,996
And everyone in the neighborhood thought
he was a good girl ...

567
00:44:01,419 --> 00:44:08,004
But I saw something different,
risky and hooking me.

568
00:44:08,581 --> 00:44:12,153
Great, tell me that girl
has not had one like that.

569
00:44:13,063 --> 00:44:14,329
That's right.

570
00:44:15,163 --> 00:44:19,115
He came knocking at my door.

571
00:44:19,644 --> 00:44:21,874
Yes, I know men and Rockie.

572
00:44:23,081 --> 00:44:27,614
One night I get on the lake.

573
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:31,455
It was warm and raining ...

574
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:36,850
And I was under the

575
00:44:37,667 --> 00:44:40,856
wished it were that
what we had gone there.

576
00:44:43,524 --> 00:44:47,381
I remember how it sounded seat
when you lean back, ...

577
00:44:47,495 --> 00:44:49,686
The patience with me
caressed her legs.

578
00:44:50,063 --> 00:44:53,221
Do not bother me, and what to
with your fingers much less.

579
00:44:54,628 --> 00:44:58,264
Suddenly, I had it in my hand.

580
00:44:59,063 --> 00:45:03,147
You are about to to come and
I also first

581
00:45:05,578 --> 00:45:08,603
And then pee lighthouse

582
00:45:10,293 --> 00:45:12,039
And I was out of the car

583
00:45:14,331 --> 00:45:16,875
To go to look at something
in a pile of leaves

584
00:45:20,387 --> 00:45:23,413
Y. .. was the farmer's neighbor

585
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:29,771
And still had ... still had
her necklace in the neck

586
00:45:29,807 --> 00:45:29,841
He had been hanging from a tree,

587
00:45:37,589 --> 00:45:42,800
He said he would kill me
if she told anyone

588
00:45:47,116 --> 00:45:48,830
"Have you told anyone?

589
00:45:57,432 --> 00:45:59,300
Yes, now.

590
00:46:09,473 --> 00:46:11,121
Jesus!

591
00:46:15,525 --> 00:46:18,615
You know? I find it incredible
how people talk about herself

592
00:46:18,895 --> 00:46:20,195
while on holiday

593
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:22,857
They talk to people
they just met.

594
00:46:23,461 --> 00:46:24,977
If.

595
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:28,653
If.

596
00:46:58,196 --> 00:46:59,531
Hey you're doing?

597
00:47:01,981 --> 00:47:05,202
Me.

598
00:47:05,692 --> 00:47:06,991
What do you do?

599
00:47:07,326 --> 00:47:10,830
I thought that was you but
then confused me.

600
00:47:11,107 --> 00:47:13,170
What are you doing here? Why do
we follow? And who is this woman?

601
00:47:13,424 --> 00:47:14,527
is my dog, Jesse

602
00:47:14,791 --> 00:47:17,172
- What are you doing here?
- You promised, brother

603
00:47:17,464 --> 00:47:19,396
In the store ok?

604
00:47:20,911 --> 00:47:23,903
Did you come here for that?

605
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:27,501
It seemed that everything was fine

606
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:31,859
Okay, slowly

607
00:47:45,027 --> 00:47:46,675
Where were you? Are you okay?

608
00:47:47,009 --> 00:47:49,488
- Yes.
- Where was my boyfriend?

609
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:51,507
The last time I saw him was ...

610
00:47:52,976 --> 00:47:54,691
I do not know, there

611
00:48:05,865 --> 00:48:07,677
Look at that.

612
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:14,865
Yes, love, look at that.

613
00:48:16,512 --> 00:48:21,044
- You want to help you, Cliff?
- I broke its neck

614
00:48:21,564 --> 00:48:23,114
The body is clean

615
00:48:23,464 --> 00:48:25,463
Love, you're a track man

616
00:48:25,798 --> 00:48:28,986
How about putting your head there?
so that the blood runs down the hill

617
00:48:29,294 --> 00:48:30,496
And not this way.

618
00:48:30,810 --> 00:48:34,577
How about if you make sure
that this work be done?

619
00:48:34,975 --> 00:48:39,124
- For me not to tell my
- Excuse me, are you going to do it or not?

620
00:48:41,608 --> 00:48:45,016
I found your
friends what do you tell them?

621
00:48:45,512 --> 00:48:47,544
Can I see that thing?

622
00:48:50,544 --> 00:48:52,193
Thanks

623
00:48:54,028 --> 00:48:58,876
You see, pass the summer
in the park Mayton

624
00:48:59,174 --> 00:49:01,556
So ...

625
00:49:01,914 --> 00:49:05,582
This is nothing for me but ...

626
00:49:05,854 --> 00:49:09,805
They will want to get it all in the ass.

627
00:49:10,171 --> 00:49:14,385
And now they want to do
is ... make the bowel

628
00:49:17,497 --> 00:49:21,646
So it is quite interesting
that's disgusting.

629
00:49:24,890 --> 00:49:26,920
Are you hungry?

630
00:49:39,451 --> 00:49:44,496
He graduated and officially step to the
category of crazy, you know, right?

631
00:49:47,122 --> 00:49:49,252
Single package our
things and get out of here

632
00:49:49,557 --> 00:49:51,883
- Inventing an excuse, shall we?
- Like what?

633
00:49:52,262 --> 00:49:54,458
Como .. believe are the murderers

634
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,744
We can say that one of
we do not feel well

635
00:49:58,352 --> 00:49:59,771
Or do not have to do that.

636
00:50:00,138 --> 00:50:01,623
We packed our
things and leave.

637
00:50:01,889 --> 00:50:04,249
It was pretty hard to get
here, we can not leave just like that

638
00:50:05,868 --> 00:50:07,264
What do you suggest?

639
00:50:10,901 --> 00:50:13,161
Alone missing 2 miles
to the beach right?

640
00:50:13,525 --> 00:50:15,455
- Two miles rather long
- I know

641
00:50:16,313 --> 00:50:18,345
But I think we have to try

642
00:50:19,403 --> 00:50:21,335
Make keep talking,

643
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:24,260
To continue thinking that being the
star of a Hollywood film

644
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:28,330
Keeping them happy so that
all reach the beach alive

645
00:50:32,841 --> 00:50:34,807
Rule number one game

646
00:50:36,207 --> 00:50:39,527
Do not let them know that something
wrong you know?

647
00:50:41,847 --> 00:50:43,627
Do you understand?

648
00:50:58,043 --> 00:51:02,029
Only that is taking longer than ever

649
00:51:08,329 --> 00:51:11,647
Well, wake up.

650
00:51:16,847 --> 00:51:18,593
Outside, out now.

651
00:51:20,613 --> 00:51:24,282
Follow us.

652
00:51:26,768 --> 00:51:31,170
Shit, we take drugs only once

653
00:51:44,173 --> 00:51:47,396
Do not move. Stay
where they are now.

654
00:51:58,325 --> 00:52:02,539
These guys are heavy. better
that let them do their job

655
00:52:09,533 --> 00:52:10,865
Come on!

656
00:52:16,601 --> 00:52:18,863
- Down!
- Pigs!

657
00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:22,241
Damn! we had nothing
to do with it. nothing!

658
00:52:29,321 --> 00:52:32,345
- What the hell did they do?
- We can not say

659
00:52:33,652 --> 00:52:35,717
Go!

660
00:52:36,464 --> 00:52:38,209
Okay, back.

661
00:52:38,515 --> 00:52:41,542
Do you have something to do with
murders in Honolulu?

662
00:52:41,891 --> 00:52:43,442
I really can not say

663
00:52:45,313 --> 00:52:48,337
Are these guys: Kale and Cleo.

664
00:52:48,791 --> 00:52:50,277
They believe it was them

665
00:52:50,615 --> 00:52:52,997
Love, do not worry. relax,
have nothing against us

666
00:52:53,309 --> 00:52:56,596
- The DEMANDARE
- Go ahead, do it

667
00:52:57,843 --> 00:53:01,031
Check all that
want. not find anything

668
00:53:03,677 --> 00:53:08,078
We were together with
them in the same car

669
00:53:33,778 --> 00:53:37,349
You know? I have to admit
that ... I thought you were

670
00:53:38,701 --> 00:53:41,692
You're kidding

671
00:53:42,650 --> 00:53:45,064
I can not believe it! I thought
who were you

672
00:53:45,362 --> 00:53:47,274
God!

673
00:54:13,016 --> 00:54:15,974
It was time

674
00:54:18,759 --> 00:54:20,889
We arrived in time for
sunset, eh.

675
00:54:21,791 --> 00:54:23,474
That awesome!

676
00:54:29,415 --> 00:54:33,465
"Hey guys that such a
photo in front of the rainbow?

677
00:54:33,833 --> 00:54:37,056
- Love, no!
- Yes!

678
00:54:37,577 --> 00:54:39,706
- Come on!
- Que bien!

679
00:54:41,983 --> 00:54:43,851
Since this

680
00:54:44,708 --> 00:54:47,032
- Is it just focus and shoot the photo?
- If

681
00:54:48,065 --> 00:54:50,031
Smile

682
00:54:51,370 --> 00:54:53,282
We survived the road

683
00:54:54,036 --> 00:54:56,100
And on our honeymoon

684
00:56:08,479 --> 00:56:10,348
Is there a cave along the coast?

685
00:56:10,661 --> 00:56:14,963
If I read about it. I think this
just below the cliff

686
00:56:15,218 --> 00:56:16,704
Let's do it!

687
00:56:17,328 --> 00:56:22,241
I'll take care of those kids.
2 Kayaks, 1 hour $ 40

688
00:56:22,596 --> 00:56:24,824
And no, you owe me 20.

689
00:56:25,134 --> 00:56:26,784
If I only have plans, that's all

690
00:56:27,075 --> 00:56:29,945
- What kind of plan?
- Plans undercover

691
00:56:34,554 --> 00:56:36,368
- Of course
- On the coast of Alaska

692
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:40,378
I caught a shark of 400 pounds. gave
good fight but you know who won

693
00:56:40,658 --> 00:56:42,241
You want to believe that
your story is true?

694
00:56:42,538 --> 00:56:43,936
- Do you want to send the photos?
- Yes.

695
00:56:44,215 --> 00:56:46,407
- Yes.
- Up we go!

696
00:56:47,415 --> 00:56:50,189
Come on, give us the opportunity to
discuss the matter of the film

697
00:56:57,018 --> 00:56:59,432
Tell Gina that I will return
before sunset

698
00:57:16,063 --> 00:57:17,808
Where do they go?

699
00:57:22,736 --> 00:57:24,996
- What?
- In the cave.

700
00:57:26,747 --> 00:57:31,182
- Do not take
- Son of a bitch!

701
00:58:48,792 --> 00:58:51,022
Wait! back!

702
00:58:55,183 --> 00:58:57,990
- What are you saying?
- No lo se

703
00:58:59,012 --> 00:59:00,662
Return, return

704
00:59:01,563 --> 00:59:03,758
"Jump high, eh?

705
00:59:05,647 --> 00:59:08,321
Regresare at sunset

706
00:59:08,546 --> 00:59:10,805
Damn it, Nick!

707
00:59:29,659 --> 00:59:31,570
Come, come, come

708
00:59:36,132 --> 00:59:37,203
Crap!

709
01:00:30,461 --> 01:00:32,306
Can you just fuel?

710
01:00:36,085 --> 01:00:37,736
How Often tactic eh?

711
01:00:38,821 --> 01:00:40,820
I just want to make sure
we are back in time

712
01:00:41,601 --> 01:00:44,725
- Yes. over and out
- Over and out

713
01:01:20,783 --> 01:01:22,236
That smell!

714
01:02:07,533 --> 01:02:08,635
Crap

715
01:02:09,234 --> 01:02:10,817
Where are you?

716
01:02:13,467 --> 01:02:16,495
- Can I ask you something?
- Shoot.

717
01:02:17,596 --> 01:02:19,377
That is ...

718
01:02:21,399 --> 01:02:22,699
"shakes the bush"

719
01:02:22,974 --> 01:02:24,492
What does it mean?

720
01:02:25,123 --> 01:02:26,641
Are you kidding?

721
01:02:28,628 --> 01:02:30,857
Is language special operations?

722
01:02:35,675 --> 01:02:40,110
What we have here is a
communication problem

723
01:02:43,406 --> 01:02:45,853
It is Paul Newman.

724
01:02:46,186 --> 01:02:48,185
In one of his best films

725
01:02:48,430 --> 01:02:51,585
- You should know
- Should, if

726
01:03:06,650 --> 01:03:10,569
You're alive.

727
01:03:33,974 --> 01:03:37,129
Your stories are great

728
01:03:38,238 --> 01:03:39,603
Very useful

729
01:03:39,922 --> 01:03:41,439
But your situational awareness

730
01:03:42,488 --> 01:03:44,235
and action really suck.

731
01:03:51,252 --> 01:03:53,065
Call me Nick

732
01:04:09,690 --> 01:04:11,403
It amazes me when they talk
people about themselves

733
01:04:11,870 --> 01:04:13,234
while on holiday

734
01:04:13,585 --> 01:04:15,235
with people they just met.

735
01:04:15,615 --> 01:04:16,948
What say?

736
01:04:17,745 --> 01:04:19,872
It amazes me when they talk
people about themselves

737
01:04:20,182 --> 01:04:21,581
while on holiday

738
01:04:21,936 --> 01:04:23,519
with people they just met.

739
01:04:30,953 --> 01:04:32,700
Love, look. Kale and Cleo are.

740
01:04:33,031 --> 01:04:37,826
- Just Married
- Suitable

741
01:04:49,344 --> 01:04:52,303
We shout. cry

742
01:04:58,097 --> 01:05:00,129
Guns? No. Does he have a gun?

743
01:05:00,472 --> 01:05:03,299
The guy named Kale, who
walks with a girl named Cleo.

744
01:05:03,589 --> 01:05:05,653
Maybe when we get back
you can tell someone

745
01:05:18,669 --> 01:05:21,345
Just two weeks

746
01:05:21,697 --> 01:05:25,551
- If for what?
- For my work

747
01:05:26,803 --> 01:05:29,611
Yes, I'm working on
a two weeks.

748
01:05:31,517 --> 01:05:34,542
And I had to invite my
sisters, you know.

749
01:05:34,818 --> 01:05:36,368
My sisters of the fraternity

750
01:05:39,227 --> 01:05:40,145
Do you?

751
01:05:40,475 --> 01:05:42,889
We have a pre-production camera.

752
01:05:43,497 --> 01:05:45,015
Hey my brother called Derek.

753
01:05:48,769 --> 01:05:51,664
You know? I'm telling you
because he can not dance.

754
01:05:53,865 --> 01:05:57,153
- Of course
- This is magic

755
01:05:57,899 --> 01:06:00,226
Our wedding ring.

756
01:06:09,616 --> 01:06:11,525
It is the happiest day of my life.

757
01:06:14,865 --> 01:06:18,534
We are now in the
urban area on Highway 19

758
01:06:18,869 --> 01:06:23,173
this afternoon a dustpan
found what appears to be another ...

759
01:06:23,692 --> 01:06:26,499
Let's go. we have
nothing to do with it

760
01:06:30,105 --> 01:06:31,306
Can I do anything for you?

761
01:06:33,197 --> 01:06:38,691
Well, not me. but do you see that
dangerously handsome man?

762
01:06:39,228 --> 01:06:42,318
When you enter and ask who was
watching can show you this ring

763
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:47,613
What about that? and we will not
deny that little away.

764
01:06:48,626 --> 01:06:51,651
It seems that most interested in
water sports at this time.

765
01:06:52,073 --> 01:06:54,553
Well, it's just a facade, believe me.

766
01:06:54,857 --> 01:06:56,190
We are looking at.

767
01:06:56,543 --> 01:06:59,350
At any time come in to get me

768
01:06:59,641 --> 01:07:01,422
and then forget something.

769
01:07:01,976 --> 01:07:05,296
I'll come back and ask
he was watching.

770
01:07:06,041 --> 01:07:07,721
You got time to play like that, eh?

771
01:07:09,861 --> 01:07:13,336
Is that it is taking its time

772
01:07:13,925 --> 01:07:15,575
Any time, sweetie.

773
01:07:18,010 --> 01:07:19,977
You know what? Solo show that there.

774
01:07:20,628 --> 01:07:21,927
Only that.

775
01:07:22,637 --> 01:07:24,285
- Shit!
- What?

776
01:07:24,639 --> 01:07:26,004
Let my water.

777
01:07:28,315 --> 01:07:31,537
And do not forget this little boy here.

778
01:07:35,269 --> 01:07:37,136
Are you planning on taking the next step?

779
01:07:37,528 --> 01:07:41,448
I have plans, covert plans.

780
01:07:42,584 --> 01:07:45,392
He will propose at sunset on the beach.

781
01:07:45,745 --> 01:07:48,834
I just need to make sure
not be ... you know ...

782
01:07:49,182 --> 01:07:53,015
Not as overwhelming as compared
with what he has in his head.

783
01:07:53,529 --> 01:07:55,145
Do you know? let me ...

784
01:07:59,864 --> 01:08:01,448
Serve?

785
01:08:02,430 --> 01:08:05,970
Will it disappoint? I will give a
back on the floor if he asks.

786
01:08:06,215 --> 01:08:08,058
I will be the most docile person
I've seen, but please.

787
01:08:08,333 --> 01:08:09,306
Help me get it right.

788
01:08:09,632 --> 01:08:11,475
Gina my first and last.

789
01:08:11,879 --> 01:08:13,212
Is indicated.

790
01:08:14,199 --> 01:08:16,043
Well, to tell the truth ...

791
01:08:19,912 --> 01:08:21,528
I think you'll love
anything to give.

792
01:08:21,929 --> 01:08:23,327
So do not buy anything?

793
01:08:23,685 --> 01:08:25,978
- Why you would want to buy something?
- I do not know.

794
01:08:26,266 --> 01:08:29,390
It's just took you so long
I thought you were hooked.

795
01:08:29,683 --> 01:08:31,136
No, I escape.

796
01:08:31,496 --> 01:08:33,527
It is 4, we catch the ferry.

797
01:08:38,111 --> 01:08:40,306
- Where is your water?
- Damn!

798
01:08:58,811 --> 01:09:03,114
Love, take me a picture
Honolulu ago.

799
01:09:03,417 --> 01:09:04,618
I have a better idea.

800
01:09:04,884 --> 01:09:06,401
Let us leave them.

801
01:09:08,259 --> 01:09:09,329
Excuse me?

802
01:09:11,915 --> 01:09:14,107
- Wait.
- Wow!

803
01:09:15,302 --> 01:09:18,939
- Shit!
- Honolulu, Hawaii!

804
01:09:19,300 --> 01:09:21,592
We did, we did it!

805
01:09:21,892 --> 01:09:22,809
"We had seen it before?

806
01:09:24,408 --> 01:09:25,609
Have not I seen it on television?

807
01:09:25,953 --> 01:09:27,352
I hope so, but no.

808
01:09:30,025 --> 01:09:34,175
Sometimes it seems as if nothing
until we got there.

809
01:09:34,971 --> 01:09:36,816
Until we
our eyes there.

810
01:09:37,072 --> 01:09:41,888
As if everyone there
only when we are there, you know?

811
01:09:42,504 --> 01:09:46,009
- Could be a nice evening.
- That is, if ... just turn my head.

812
01:09:48,001 --> 01:09:49,933
Just a minute y. ..
do not tell me.

813
01:09:50,210 --> 01:09:52,884
But everything stops,

814
01:09:54,658 --> 01:09:58,131
And he enters a mode of
hibernation to save power.

815
01:09:59,012 --> 01:10:02,006
And I can
simply reactivate ...

816
01:10:06,706 --> 01:10:09,087
You should tell me something
nice occasionally.

817
01:10:09,411 --> 01:10:10,929
How many times must I tell you?

818
01:10:11,896 --> 01:10:15,053
If there is anyone in this
world who can love is you

819
01:10:15,796 --> 01:10:18,568
- Why is never enough?
- Just forget it.

820
01:10:24,627 --> 01:10:25,924
Look.

821
01:10:26,824 --> 01:10:29,498
You helped create this
dream of immortality.

822
01:10:30,319 --> 01:10:33,637
You are the witness
privileged to help me

823
01:10:33,962 --> 01:10:36,223
to carry hundreds of different lives

824
01:10:37,359 --> 01:10:38,843
You are.

825
01:10:40,778 --> 01:10:44,444
- Look ...
- Save it.

826
01:10:45,115 --> 01:10:50,706
I know your need for detachment is
what unites you with my need for attachment.

827
01:10:51,017 --> 01:10:52,089
That's all!

828
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:55,343
It's a damn link.
I understand, ok.

829
01:10:56,359 --> 01:10:58,487
Let's stop lying to us.

830
01:11:03,417 --> 01:11:04,968
I'm not lying now

831
01:11:05,437 --> 01:11:07,470
I love the idea of love.

832
01:11:09,796 --> 01:11:11,763
And I love to listen.

833
01:11:13,869 --> 01:11:15,680
It's sickening and sad.

834
01:11:20,448 --> 01:11:22,096
That makes me mad?

835
01:11:24,021 --> 01:11:25,507
Am I crazy?

836
01:11:26,717 --> 01:11:29,129
It makes you exciting.

837
01:11:48,213 --> 01:11:51,108
It's time.

838
01:11:56,119 --> 01:11:57,734
Extraordinary.

839
01:15:18,809 --> 01:15:20,208
Jesus!

840
01:15:30,195 --> 01:15:31,397
Who is this?

841
01:15:31,779 --> 01:15:32,947
Hello, my name is Muni.

842
01:15:33,245 --> 01:15:35,756
And I call to ensure that this
receiving all services ...

843
01:15:36,116 --> 01:15:39,436
Jesus Christ, where is? What state?

844
01:15:42,696 --> 01:15:44,443
Muni, there have been several
murders in Honolulu

845
01:15:44,727 --> 01:15:46,311
of which may have
heard

846
01:15:46,646 --> 01:15:48,493
but are chasing me
and I need your help

847
01:15:48,767 --> 01:15:50,034
Could you do that for me?

848
01:15:51,175 --> 01:15:52,441
Muni "are you there?

849
01:15:53,046 --> 01:15:57,327
Yes, ma'am. the new plan
we can offer more minutes ...

850
01:15:58,919 --> 01:16:00,731
To hell with that! "Listen to me si?

851
01:16:01,179 --> 01:16:02,726
Going to be my 911 call.

852
01:16:04,671 --> 01:16:06,833
I need to call the
police department.

853
01:16:07,414 --> 01:16:12,394
And tell them take you to the
murderers to the beach in 30 minutes.

854
01:16:13,060 --> 01:16:14,458
Can you do that for me?

855
01:16:16,397 --> 01:16:20,318
- I'll put it on hold
- No, you will not do that!

856
01:16:20,685 --> 01:16:23,742
No check with your
supervisors. I need to do it!

857
01:16:24,051 --> 01:16:27,339
Maybe I need to ask
air support or something.

858
01:16:27,726 --> 01:16:29,278
Just ...

859
01:16:33,286 --> 01:16:35,832
Hello? Hello, ma'am?

860
01:16:37,749 --> 01:16:39,017
Hello?

861
01:16:39,487 --> 01:16:41,812
Please tell me you're going to
help. please, please.

862
01:16:44,017 --> 01:16:46,594
- Is in the Pacific Ocean?
- Jesus!

863
01:16:46,968 --> 01:16:48,584
God, I hope you
recording this!

864
01:16:48,870 --> 01:16:50,290
If it is in the Pacific Ocean!

865
01:16:50,585 --> 01:16:51,916
Yes, it is one of the 5 ...

866
01:16:54,822 --> 01:16:57,365
... in the Hawaiian chain ...

867
01:17:04,571 --> 01:17:05,869
Stay right there.

868
01:18:24,271 --> 01:18:25,441
Whore!

869
01:18:30,888 --> 01:18:32,950
See? escape.

870
01:18:33,235 --> 01:18:34,599
See you at the beach.

871
01:18:35,558 --> 01:18:38,615
Remember, nothing exists
until we arrived.

872
01:18:41,823 --> 01:18:44,234
Understood. and nothing
until you get there.

873
01:19:47,729 --> 01:19:49,344
There I go, love.

874
01:20:37,729 --> 01:20:39,989
We did not want to scare her.
Did not you see 2 kayaks?

875
01:20:40,258 --> 01:20:42,488
He shot my boyfriend.
I shot.

876
01:20:42,905 --> 01:20:44,106
Let me see, let me see.

877
01:20:44,417 --> 01:20:45,519
- Go!
- Listen!

878
01:20:45,805 --> 01:20:47,135
- I'm a paramedic.
- I do not care!

879
01:20:47,409 --> 01:20:48,708
- Let me see that
- I need a phone.

880
01:20:48,963 --> 01:20:50,328
For the coming ... no, let me go!

881
01:20:52,243 --> 01:20:54,175
I'm a paramedic.
Let revisarte.

882
01:20:57,672 --> 01:20:59,288
- Well, I calmare.
- Calm down.

883
01:21:07,932 --> 01:21:09,899
- Hold it!
- Go!

884
01:21:10,192 --> 01:21:11,195
Listen, you're safe.

885
01:21:12,073 --> 01:21:15,481
- They do not understand.
- What are you talking about?

886
01:21:19,210 --> 01:21:20,826

Look, man. we are only here because
someone took 2 of our boats.

902
01:22:29,241 --> 01:22:31,686
And the last thing we want is

903
01:22:32,444 --> 01:22:34,224
- Is that clear?
- Yes, it is clear.

904
01:22:34,588 --> 01:22:36,303

"Nick you think this is the end?

01:24:36,215 --> 01:24:39,689
The bad pay for what
he did, I hate that ending.

01:24:40,052 --> 01:24:43,427
It's just a cliche. It's your

If you kill, you kill yourself.

And do not want to do that.

922
01:25:02,281 --> 01:25:03,614
Drop your weapon now!

What you did wrong not to kill me!

01:25:48,630 --> 01:25:50,756
Need to know if
I have the right man.

937
01:25:51,097 --> 01:25:52,516
Now it is he who
I shoot?

938
01:25:52,839 --> 01:25:54,968
Come on, do it! Just do it, come on.

939
01:25:55,275 --> 01:25:56,672
- Do.
- Over!

940
01:25:56,979 --> 01:25:58,376
Drop your weapon!

01:25:59,949 --> 01:26:02,845
Do it. Extraordinary!

I will not die.
I will not die.

943

If you, I would have.

944
01:26:38,026 --> 01:26:39,774
But you're not.

945

The other.

01:26:53,716 --> 01:26:55,628
Who killed all those people.

947
01:26:57,096 --> 01:27:00,414
And screwed up my life.

948
01:27:01,519 --> 01:27:06,184
It's the same guy who is
about to take that weapon.

949
01:27:16,089 --> 01:27:18,249
Yes, him.

950
01:27:41,639 --> 01:27:43,999
- What are you doing?
- Wait.

01:27:48,748 --> 01:27:50,365
This is for you.

Wow.
