1
00:02:09,968 --> 00:02:13,613
What are you doing? Come back.

2
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,535
- No.
- Come on. Turn around.

3
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,902
<i>Hey, hey!</i>

4
00:03:57,727 --> 00:04:00,094
You're the best.
You're amazing.

5
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:14,807
What do you say?
Beers on me. Cold beers on me.

6
00:04:14,881 --> 00:04:16,856
<i>Let's go!</i>

7
00:04:18,978 --> 00:04:21,629
Wonderful.
Weren't they wonderful?

8
00:04:32,899 --> 00:04:35,453
Come on.
Keep it going, Gray.

9
00:04:41,957 --> 00:04:44,324
<i>- Hey.
- Help!</i>

10
00:04:44,389 --> 00:04:48,099
- Okay.
- Help. Ohh.

11
00:04:49,542 --> 00:04:51,844
- Don't rush over, okay?
- You pick up something for dinner?

12
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:53,918
- Yeah. Mmm.
- What do you got?

13
00:04:53,991 --> 00:04:57,537
- Okay, I got us steak.
- Good.

14
00:04:57,607 --> 00:04:59,996
- And chicken.
- Good.

15
00:05:00,072 --> 00:05:01,894
- And fish.
- And fish.

16
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,007
<i>- And tofu.
- Good.</i>

17
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,535
- And tempeh.
- Oh, great. We got tempeh.

18
00:05:05,608 --> 00:05:07,496
Then I got the regular essentials,
like asparagus and lettuce.

19
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,415
<i>I got it.</i>

20
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,296
I'm not home, okay?
Don't answer it, okay? Let's-

21
00:05:12,361 --> 00:05:15,973
Hello? Hey, Carrie. Who?

22
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:18,081
Yeah, she's right here.

23
00:05:21,483 --> 00:05:23,338
Hey, honey.

24
00:05:23,403 --> 00:05:26,251
<i>- Dinner? No. We just rented a DVD.
- Raging Bull.</i>

25
00:05:26,315 --> 00:05:29,611
- We go out. I hate when you say that.
- I hate it when she says that.

26
00:05:29,676 --> 00:05:33,386
- Okay, uh, do you want a, uh, merlot or cabernet?
- Oh, here we go.

27
00:05:33,452 --> 00:05:35,558
Do you want something fruity
or full-bodied and do-

28
00:05:35,629 --> 00:05:40,136
Okay. Okay. What- Californian, French,
Argentinean, Chilean, Australian, Span-

29
00:05:40,205 --> 00:05:42,060
- Still at it?
- Okay, you don't have to yell.

30
00:05:45,198 --> 00:05:49,127
<i>- Ohh!
- Oh, my God. That is amazing.</i>

31
00:05:49,198 --> 00:05:51,337
Oh, my God. Carrie.

32
00:05:51,407 --> 00:05:54,756
Do you believe this?
Ta-da!

33
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,461
I would like to say something.

34
00:06:00,528 --> 00:06:05,613
To Carrie and Dereck
and their lovely friends.

35
00:06:11,601 --> 00:06:13,424
Oh, my goodness.

36
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:15,727
I don't know what it means,
but it sounded beautiful.

37
00:06:15,794 --> 00:06:18,991
<i>- It's a fake accent. He's from Poughkeepsie.
- God, he is adorable.</i>

38
00:06:19,058 --> 00:06:21,000
I could eat him alive.
Do you think he's single?

39
00:06:21,075 --> 00:06:23,214
<i>- I don't think he plays on your team.
- But he's overweight.</i>

40
00:06:23,283 --> 00:06:26,545
And poofs are rarely beefy. I wrote
a piece about that in a magazine once.

41
00:06:26,612 --> 00:06:28,139
<i>- Did you?
- Mm-hmm.</i>

42
00:06:28,211 --> 00:06:30,929
Carrie, do you have
the new Liza Minnelli CD?

43
00:06:30,996 --> 00:06:34,793
<i>- Mmm. Okay, and scratch my last comment. Cheers.
- Cheers.</i>

44
00:06:34,869 --> 00:06:37,968
How's that new campaign coming along?
Carrie tells me it's been brutal.

45
00:06:38,037 --> 00:06:40,591
<i>- Oh, uh, more for you, yeah?
- Yes.</i>

46
00:06:40,662 --> 00:06:42,964
- Red or white?
- I'll have red. Actually, I'll have white.

47
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:44,885
- Okay.
- You know, I'll have both.

48
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:47,634
- All right.
- Um, well, Julia Bartlett is not an easygoing client.

49
00:06:47,703 --> 00:06:50,900
- She's the worst.
- If Carrie wasn't on the account, I'd pull my hair out.

50
00:06:50,967 --> 00:06:52,855
Oh, honey.

51
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:55,407
- Doesn't mean you're getting
a promotion before me.

52
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:59,026
- Ooh, you sneaky little bitch.
- So, um, what do you do?

53
00:06:59,096 --> 00:07:01,944
I'm doing my, uh, surgical residency
at Mount Sinai Hospital...

54
00:07:02,009 --> 00:07:04,693
with a specialty in, uh-
heart transplants.

55
00:07:04,761 --> 00:07:07,095
- Oh, fabulous.
- Thanks.

56
00:07:07,162 --> 00:07:09,748
And how long have
you two been together?

57
00:07:10,842 --> 00:07:12,697
- Us two?
- Mm-hmm.

58
00:07:12,762 --> 00:07:16,538
Thirty years.

59
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:19,505
- I'm sorry. Did I miss something?
- Well, you're kidding, right?

60
00:07:19,579 --> 00:07:22,514
- No.
- Gray's my sister.

61
00:07:22,587 --> 00:07:24,726
Oh, my God!
No! Ick! No, I'm-

62
00:07:24,796 --> 00:07:28,441
I just- I thought that you
two were an item. Well, I just-

63
00:07:28,508 --> 00:07:31,476
- What? These-These two?
- Well, yeah. You seem so-

64
00:07:31,549 --> 00:07:33,556
So?

65
00:07:33,629 --> 00:07:36,629
<i>I don't know.
So together, I guess.</i>

66
00:07:36,701 --> 00:07:38,556
Hey, what'd I miss?

67
00:07:38,622 --> 00:07:42,932
<i>- Um, she thinks we're together.
- Like "together"together?</i>

68
00:07:43,006 --> 00:07:44,948
- Like screwing each other together.
- Ugh!

69
00:07:45,022 --> 00:07:46,877
You're not the first one
to think that, Elaine.

70
00:07:46,942 --> 00:07:48,797
- Let me tell you.
- What?

71
00:07:48,863 --> 00:07:50,903
- They're very codependent.
- We are not!

72
00:07:50,976 --> 00:07:53,398
- Come on. - You rarely spend
a minute apart. But if that's-

73
00:07:53,472 --> 00:07:56,025
- We do too.
- All day at work, we never see each other.

74
00:07:56,096 --> 00:07:57,623
How about that- Remember?

75
00:07:57,697 --> 00:08:00,217
You want to know something? I've even seen
them share the same toothbrush.

76
00:08:00,288 --> 00:08:02,842
- One time.
- Oh, ick.

77
00:08:02,913 --> 00:08:08,063
- One time is- it's creepy. - L- Listen.
I think that your relationship is charming.

78
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:10,235
- Thank you.
- Have you ever French-kissed?

79
00:08:10,306 --> 00:08:14,049
<i>That's beautiful.</i>

80
00:08:14,115 --> 00:08:16,985
- We're gonna end up like the Delany sisters.
- Who?

81
00:08:17,059 --> 00:08:20,092
You know, the sisters that were 103
and 105, and they never got married...

82
00:08:20,163 --> 00:08:22,368
and they just did yoga and headstands
together every day.

83
00:08:22,436 --> 00:08:24,411
That's what we should do.
Do headstands together.

84
00:08:24,484 --> 00:08:26,339
Get the circulation flowing.
It'd be good for us.

85
00:08:26,404 --> 00:08:30,496
- I'm serious. We need to venture out.
- To where? When?

86
00:08:30,565 --> 00:08:32,736
I'm too busy to date,
and I'm not goin' to bars.

87
00:08:32,805 --> 00:08:36,122
The girls there, all they do is they talk
about how fat they are. They're not fat.

88
00:08:36,198 --> 00:08:38,435
They're not fat girls.
They're thin girls that think they're fat.

89
00:08:38,502 --> 00:08:42,212
You know what I want? I want a girl who's
not afraid to eat a hot fudge sundae, okay...

90
00:08:42,278 --> 00:08:44,668
and have no guilt attached,
that's what I want.

91
00:08:44,743 --> 00:08:46,631
Can't you meet a cute intern
at the hospital?

92
00:08:46,695 --> 00:08:48,703
Wrong. Can't do it. Too dangerous.

93
00:08:48,776 --> 00:08:51,842
You can't have sexual tension
and cut an artery. It's awkward.

94
00:08:51,912 --> 00:08:55,622
Okay, I'll look for a hot fudge sundae girl
for you, and you look for a guy for me...

95
00:08:55,688 --> 00:08:58,689
- who is deep and sensitive and funny.
- Okay.

96
00:08:58,761 --> 00:09:02,339
Someone who doesn't think Ginger Rogers
is one of the Spice Girls.

97
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:05,890
- Okay.
- Someone who wouldn't consider going to Florida traveling.

98
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:09,410
- All right.
- Someone who's not afraid of Ethiopian food.

99
00:09:11,946 --> 00:09:14,151
Somebody who doesn't think
Truffaut's a kind of mushroom.

100
00:09:14,219 --> 00:09:16,903
Someone who would call me
an hour after our first date and say...

101
00:09:16,972 --> 00:09:21,162
"I am crazy about you, and I'm counting
the minutes until I could see you again. "

102
00:09:23,149 --> 00:09:25,800
That's not gonna be easy, darlin'.

103
00:09:25,869 --> 00:09:28,520
Ethiopian food, I-I like that.

104
00:09:30,157 --> 00:09:33,060
Eatin' with your fingers, things.

105
00:09:33,134 --> 00:09:35,338
It's quite festive.

106
00:09:42,127 --> 00:09:43,982
Hey, Jimmy.
Happy birthday!

107
00:09:44,047 --> 00:09:45,902
- Hi, Tommy.
- Hi.

108
00:09:45,967 --> 00:09:47,822
Oh, sorry about that.

109
00:09:47,888 --> 00:09:50,092
Hey, Jenny, I promise I'll write
my daytimes. I totally forgot.

110
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,200
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry I'm late.

111
00:09:52,272 --> 00:09:55,502
My Weight Watchers meeting went over,
and it was too good to leave.

112
00:09:55,569 --> 00:09:58,057
Why do you still go to those meetings?
You have an awesome figure.

113
00:09:58,129 --> 00:10:00,617
Oh, thanks.
Dereck thinks that I have flabby thighs.

114
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:03,112
He has nerve. He has a receding hairline.
Did you mention that to him?

115
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:06,252
- Did you tell him to go to receding hairline meetings?
- Yeah, I know. Right?

116
00:10:06,322 --> 00:10:10,730
But trust me. The entertainment factor
alone is worth it. Today, it was so crazy.

117
00:10:10,802 --> 00:10:13,999
There was this woman who was all mad at
her husband for not letting her have dessert.

118
00:10:14,067 --> 00:10:17,450
So she breaks into
the Soho Chocolate Factory...

119
00:10:17,523 --> 00:10:20,011
and tried to drown herself
in a vat of chocolate.

120
00:10:20,084 --> 00:10:21,513
<i>- No.
- Yes.</i>

121
00:10:21,588 --> 00:10:24,010
<i>- Like Augustus Gloop in Willy Wonka?
- Exactly.</i>

122
00:10:24,085 --> 00:10:26,354
It's like the cuckoo show.

123
00:10:26,421 --> 00:10:28,625
Ooh, let's see
who's in Page Six today.

124
00:10:28,693 --> 00:10:31,181
We need to focus. I have a B-Pro
presentation in three minutes...

125
00:10:31,254 --> 00:10:33,775
with copy that's so pedestrian it sounds
like a crossing guard wrote it.

126
00:10:33,846 --> 00:10:36,050
What happened to that cheerleading idea?
That was so good.

127
00:10:36,119 --> 00:10:38,541
- It's so cool and kitsch. Kitsch is in.
- You think it was good?

128
00:10:38,615 --> 00:10:40,655
I told Lana about it.
She said it was a big mistake.

129
00:10:40,727 --> 00:10:43,761
- She says Julia Bartlett hates kitsch.
- Lana? Don't listen to Lana.

130
00:10:43,832 --> 00:10:46,036
She's Mr. Phillips's secretary.
What does she know?

131
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:48,625
I do think she does a lot more
than just type for him.

132
00:10:48,697 --> 00:10:52,854
- Give it up.
- Okay. You want to hear this? I heard some hot gossip.

133
00:10:52,921 --> 00:10:57,264
- Yeah. - Lana-Wait, I feel
like somebody's listening-

134
00:10:57,338 --> 00:11:00,240
Lana goes to Kemiko,
my pedicurist...

135
00:11:00,314 --> 00:11:03,162
and told her, who then told
Mrs. Karaquesh, my dry cleaner...

136
00:11:03,226 --> 00:11:06,456
- she and Mr. Phillips have been seeing each other for months.
- No!

137
00:11:06,523 --> 00:11:09,273
I know it's accurate gossip
'cause Mrs. Karaquesh never gossips.

138
00:11:09,339 --> 00:11:11,728
- Oh, my God!
- Ever.

139
00:11:11,803 --> 00:11:14,705
- Hey, Lana!
- Hey!

140
00:11:14,779 --> 00:11:17,431
Hey! What's up?
Do you want to have lunch with us today?

141
00:11:17,501 --> 00:11:21,331
Oh, I'd love to, but Mr. Phillips asked me
to do some research for him, so-

142
00:11:21,404 --> 00:11:24,023
<i>Oh, really?
Oh, that's too bad.</i>

143
00:11:24,093 --> 00:11:25,587
- Maybe next week?
- Definitely.

144
00:11:25,661 --> 00:11:29,306
- Okay.
- Bye.

145
00:11:29,374 --> 00:11:31,741
Research my ass.

146
00:11:31,807 --> 00:11:34,807
You mean her ass.

147
00:11:46,752 --> 00:11:48,662
B- Pro.

148
00:11:48,736 --> 00:11:50,591
The campaign-

149
00:11:50,656 --> 00:11:53,853
Conrad, make sure the, uh, video system's
on. I want the whole company to hear this.

150
00:11:55,906 --> 00:11:59,202
It's on, sir. Carry on, Gray.

151
00:11:59,266 --> 00:12:02,976
The campaign exudes
nostalgia, comedy...

152
00:12:03,042 --> 00:12:06,785
thrill, excitement and cutting-edge
fashion all under one banner.

153
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:10,147
It'll appeal to a wide demographic
and leads the consumer...

154
00:12:10,212 --> 00:12:13,027
<i>with an emotional end benefit
of feeling charged up.</i>

155
00:12:13,092 --> 00:12:17,468
To challenge themselves and seize the day
and be the best they can be.

156
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:19,363
Whoo!

157
00:12:22,053 --> 00:12:25,469
Well, Julia?

158
00:12:25,542 --> 00:12:30,212
And I must say you look fantastic.

159
00:12:30,278 --> 00:12:33,093
What do you think?
Great, no?

160
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:36,160
No.

161
00:12:36,232 --> 00:12:39,680
- N-N-No?
- No.

162
00:12:40,936 --> 00:12:43,140
<i>Well, it's, uh-it's
just an initial proposal.</i>

163
00:12:43,209 --> 00:12:45,630
I mean, it still needs
to be tweaked and tuned.

164
00:12:45,704 --> 00:12:49,120
You only tweak or tune
if something has potential.

165
00:12:51,913 --> 00:12:54,728
Uh, we'll, uh-we'll go back
to the drawing board then, that's all.

166
00:12:54,793 --> 00:12:58,918
Why don't you call me when
you have something original to present?

167
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:01,442
Julia, I'm sure we have a bunch of-
Shut that thing off.

168
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:04,232
<i>I'm sure we have a bunch of things.
This is just one of them.</i>

169
00:13:04,299 --> 00:13:07,812
What's wrong with you? That was crap.
J- Julia, just a second.

170
00:13:10,412 --> 00:13:13,990
I don't know, Sydney. I don't know
if this kind of therapy is working for me.

171
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:16,843
How come every road I take
turns out to be a dead end?

172
00:13:16,909 --> 00:13:18,764
Why couldn't it be a fork?
I like forks.

173
00:13:18,829 --> 00:13:21,732
At least with a fork there's a choice-
right or left or east or west...

174
00:13:21,806 --> 00:13:23,879
- or this way or that way.
- Mm-hmm.

175
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:27,528
Why do you think you always reach
these dead ends?

176
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:31,046
Ooh! You see, gutter ball.
That's my life- a bunch of gutter balls.

177
00:13:31,118 --> 00:13:33,061
Well, this is a perfect example...

178
00:13:33,136 --> 00:13:36,714
of why having therapy in different
locations is so important.

179
00:13:36,783 --> 00:13:39,053
Look at the deep symbolism
in that gutter ball.

180
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,291
No, this is good.

181
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,499
This is very, very good.

182
00:13:49,425 --> 00:13:53,932
Can you think of one word
that best describes...

183
00:13:54,002 --> 00:13:57,298
- the way your work situation makes you feel?
- Can I have two?

184
00:13:57,362 --> 00:14:01,225
- No, one.
- Um-

185
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:06,922
Ohh!
Frustrated.

186
00:14:06,995 --> 00:14:08,905
- You're up.
- Right.

187
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:12,014
Okay, another word...

188
00:14:12,085 --> 00:14:16,428
for how you really feel
when your brother wins all your races.

189
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:23,819
- Frustrated.
- Okay.

190
00:14:23,894 --> 00:14:27,440
Another word for how you feel
when you think about going on a date.

191
00:14:30,295 --> 00:14:32,848
- Closed for repairs.
- That's not one word.

192
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:35,254
I know.
But I can't help it.

193
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:40,918
It's a weird thing,
but I see myself as this charming hotel...

194
00:14:40,985 --> 00:14:46,037
that's beautifully romantic
and... wonderful on the outside...

195
00:14:46,105 --> 00:14:48,658
but on the inside, it just
needs a ton of renovations.

196
00:14:48,729 --> 00:14:50,639
Hence, closed for repairs.

197
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:54,000
Nice analogy.

198
00:14:56,283 --> 00:14:58,738
What kinds of renovations?

199
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,769
Getting a promotion at work,
perfecting the tango...

200
00:15:02,843 --> 00:15:06,357
disowning my mother,
getting liposuction under my chin.

201
00:15:06,428 --> 00:15:08,916
There's nothing worse than chin fat.

202
00:15:08,988 --> 00:15:13,495
Uh, I think you need to...

203
00:15:13,565 --> 00:15:17,395
let the idea of sharing your life
with someone other than your brother...

204
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:20,056
enter your consciousness.

205
00:15:20,126 --> 00:15:22,996
But how can I be conscious of something
that I'm unconscious of?

206
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:27,381
It's not like I don't date. I've had plenty
of boyfriends. Maybe I'm just in a dry spell.

207
00:15:27,455 --> 00:15:29,310
Let's try something.

208
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:32,409
How about keeping
the hotel closed...

209
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,776
but keeping the veranda
open for cocktails?

210
00:15:37,408 --> 00:15:40,922
Well, I really like verandas.
I love trellises, and I love arboretums.

211
00:15:40,993 --> 00:15:42,902
Aren't arboretums beautiful?
And houses with the porch out front-

212
00:15:42,977 --> 00:15:45,312
Hold that thought.
'Cause we are out of time today...

213
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:49,404
but we will resume this conversation
next week at the rock climbing wall.

214
00:15:49,474 --> 00:15:51,710
Nice game.

215
00:15:54,659 --> 00:15:56,448
And what happened to
going to a movie?

216
00:15:56,515 --> 00:15:58,588
How are you going to meet anyone
in a dark movie theater?

217
00:15:58,659 --> 00:16:00,546
How are you going to meet
anyone at a dog park?

218
00:16:00,612 --> 00:16:02,467
Hello? The dog park
is a vortex for singles.

219
00:16:02,532 --> 00:16:04,387
Hello? When did we
become dog owners?

220
00:16:04,452 --> 00:16:06,362
<i>No.</i>

221
00:16:11,301 --> 00:16:14,051
I wash my hand of this whole fiasco.
You're on your own. Ow! Grabbing.

222
00:16:14,118 --> 00:16:16,988
- Check out center field.
- What about cen-Ahh!

223
00:16:17,061 --> 00:16:19,745
Ohh! Yes!

224
00:16:19,814 --> 00:16:21,669
Holy... smokes.

225
00:16:21,734 --> 00:16:24,223
I'll do the preinterview. If she's
great, uh, I'll scream, "Get the ball!"

226
00:16:24,295 --> 00:16:26,597
- And you casually swing over to close.
- "Get the ball. "

227
00:16:26,663 --> 00:16:29,030
<i>- What?
- There's no way she's single.</i>

228
00:16:29,095 --> 00:16:31,397
- Do what I say.
- You know what? Don't get bossy.

229
00:16:31,463 --> 00:16:35,009
- Ow! Ohh.
- Try not to get hurt. Spazzy men are not attractive.

230
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,699
Some spazzy men are attractive.

231
00:16:40,137 --> 00:16:42,243
- Gosh. You're so beautiful.
- Thank you.

232
00:16:42,314 --> 00:16:44,736
- How old is she?
- She just turned three in September.

233
00:16:44,809 --> 00:16:47,177
- Or should I say 21?
- She's legal.

234
00:16:47,242 --> 00:16:49,795
Yeah. I suppose
I should buy her her first cocktail, huh?

235
00:16:49,866 --> 00:16:53,030
<i>Maybe a liver martini
with a beefjerky twist?</i>

236
00:16:53,099 --> 00:16:54,790
- I'm Charlie.
- Hi.

237
00:16:54,859 --> 00:16:58,656
<i>Originally Charlotte, but it always seemed
too long and never quite suited me, so-</i>

238
00:16:58,732 --> 00:17:01,699
I'm Gray. You can't really shorten that
or it'd be "Gra. "

239
00:17:01,772 --> 00:17:03,977
<i>- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.</i>

240
00:17:04,045 --> 00:17:06,020
- Do you like old movies?
- Yeah.

241
00:17:06,093 --> 00:17:08,427
- Dancing? Are you athletic?
- Uh-

242
00:17:08,493 --> 00:17:10,316
- Do you watch the Discovery Channel?
- Well-

243
00:17:10,381 --> 00:17:12,356
<i>Do you have a boyfriend?
What is your favorite dessert?</i>

244
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:14,950
Okay. Um, uh-

245
00:17:15,021 --> 00:17:17,575
Let's see.
I'm a 1940s movie buff.

246
00:17:17,646 --> 00:17:19,588
<i>I love to swing dance.</i>

247
00:17:19,662 --> 00:17:21,517
I've never been
very good at sports...

248
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:24,932
um, love the Discovery Channel,
"nix-ay" on the boyfriend...

249
00:17:25,007 --> 00:17:27,342
<i>and, well, it's kind of a toss-up.</i>

250
00:17:27,407 --> 00:17:29,797
L- I like cheesecake,
but I kind of love...

251
00:17:29,871 --> 00:17:34,280
those big, gooey
hot fudge sundaes, so-

252
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:36,295
Get the ball.

253
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:54,670
Who's that? Look at him!
Oh, you're so cute. What's his name?

254
00:17:54,739 --> 00:17:57,194
- Fluffy.
- Suki.

255
00:17:57,267 --> 00:18:00,584
Fluffy is his first name.
Suki is his pedestrian middle name.

256
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,515
Oh, well, you are so adorable.

257
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,523
- How old is he?
- He's five. - One.

258
00:18:04,596 --> 00:18:07,018
<i>He's one- He's one-five. He's 15.</i>

259
00:18:07,093 --> 00:18:08,948
- This is my brother, Sam.
- Sam.

260
00:18:09,013 --> 00:18:11,632
Sam.

261
00:18:11,702 --> 00:18:14,321
- My sea otter's name is Sam.
- Is your sea otter's name Sam?

262
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:16,365
- Yes.
- Don't tell me you're one of those people...

263
00:18:16,438 --> 00:18:18,544
that illegally keeps endangered animals
in their apartment, like that guy...

264
00:18:18,615 --> 00:18:20,273
that got caught with
a leopard in his kitchen?

265
00:18:20,343 --> 00:18:23,475
No. I'm a zoologist. I'm doing an
internship at New York Aquarium.

266
00:18:23,543 --> 00:18:26,642
<i>- Ha! That's a relief.
- Free Willy is my favorite movie.</i>

267
00:18:26,712 --> 00:18:30,062
<i>Well, Free Willy 1, 2 and 3.
It's hard to pick a favorite.</i>

268
00:18:30,136 --> 00:18:31,991
<i>And Jaws.
Finding Nemo.</i>

269
00:18:32,057 --> 00:18:34,293
<i>Orca. Orca not so much.</i>

270
00:18:34,361 --> 00:18:37,710
- Do you live around here?
- Uh, sort of, yeah.

271
00:18:37,786 --> 00:18:39,761
I'm staying on
a friend's sofa for right now.

272
00:18:39,834 --> 00:18:42,038
I just moved here from San Francisco
about three weeks ago.

273
00:18:42,106 --> 00:18:45,969
- I love San Francisco.
- Really? Have you spent much time there?

274
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:47,897
- Have I?
- You've never been to San Francisco.

275
00:18:47,963 --> 00:18:50,646
I know I've never been to San Francisco,
but I know I would love it.

276
00:18:50,715 --> 00:18:53,749
<i>Tony Bennett loves it. He left his heart
there. I love Tony Bennett. There you go.</i>

277
00:18:55,579 --> 00:18:58,362
I have to go home for dinner.
Can I have Flicker back?

278
00:18:58,428 --> 00:19:01,560
Yeah. You can have Flicker Fluffy
Suki back. That's the neighbor's dog.

279
00:19:01,629 --> 00:19:04,629
We just walk him while he takes piano lessons,
'cause we love that dog.

280
00:19:04,701 --> 00:19:07,287
- He's a budding pianist.
- That's so funny. Gypsy's not mine either.

281
00:19:07,357 --> 00:19:09,212
I dog walk on the side
for extra cash.

282
00:19:09,277 --> 00:19:11,766
I should probably
get her back, so-

283
00:19:12,926 --> 00:19:15,315
Oh.

284
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:17,278
It was really nice to meet you both.

285
00:19:17,343 --> 00:19:19,613
- Nice meeting you both-You.
- Nice meeting you.

286
00:19:21,792 --> 00:19:23,931
- What are you waiting for?
- What?

287
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,099
- She's leaving.
- I see she's leaving.

288
00:19:27,168 --> 00:19:29,819
All right.
Uh, excuse me!

289
00:19:29,888 --> 00:19:33,336
<i>Since you're new in town, if you're not
doing anything tonight, maybe you'djoin us?</i>

290
00:19:33,409 --> 00:19:36,312
<i>We're going out for tapas and bad
Spanish wine, if you'd like tojoin us.</i>

291
00:19:36,386 --> 00:19:38,720
I just said that.
Would you like to join us? Three times.

292
00:19:38,785 --> 00:19:42,364
- Yeah, I'd love to.
- Okay.

293
00:19:52,356 --> 00:19:54,331
<i>Perfecto!</i>

294
00:20:02,278 --> 00:20:04,318
<i>R- R-R-ico.
R- R-R-R-R.</i>

295
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:08,285
<i>R- R-R-R-R-R-Rico.</i>

296
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:23,782
<i>Oh, easy, Pancho Villa. These girls
are conmigo. More vino, por favor.</i>

297
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:26,948
<i>! Ayayay, oh!</i>

298
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:29,505
<i>Gracias. Gracias.</i>

299
00:20:59,245 --> 00:21:02,377
Carlos! Cover me!

300
00:21:02,446 --> 00:21:04,388
I'm goin' in.

301
00:21:49,044 --> 00:21:51,695
Okay, best food movie.

302
00:21:51,765 --> 00:21:54,798
<i>- Like Water For Chocolate.
- Babette's Feast. How about Babette's Feast?</i>

303
00:21:54,868 --> 00:21:57,236
<i>- Okay.
- Okay, Fatso starring Dom DeLuise.</i>

304
00:21:57,301 --> 00:21:59,276
- Yes.
- Oh, good one. Okay, is it me?

305
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:01,455
Let's see.
Uh, women you need to get away from.

306
00:22:01,526 --> 00:22:03,665
<i>Bette Davis in
What Ever Happened To BabyJane?</i>

307
00:22:03,734 --> 00:22:06,484
<i>Ah, good one. I got Glenn Close in
Fatal Attraction for the rabbit.</i>

308
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:10,642
<i>- Kathy Bates in Misery.
- Okay. Okay. How 'bout, um, best screen kiss?</i>

309
00:22:10,711 --> 00:22:14,486
<i>- Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh in Gone with the Wind.
- That's overrated, I think.</i>

310
00:22:14,552 --> 00:22:17,618
<i>I'll go with Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman
in Notorious.</i>

311
00:22:17,688 --> 00:22:19,598
<i>Okay. I'll see your Notorious...</i>

312
00:22:19,673 --> 00:22:22,739
<i>and I'll raise you Omar Sharif and
Julie Christie in Doctor Zhivago.</i>

313
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:24,915
<i>- Very good.
- Oh, wait. I'll see your Doctor Zhivago...</i>

314
00:22:24,985 --> 00:22:27,920
<i>and I will raise you Lady and the Tramp
in Lady and the Tramp.</i>

315
00:22:27,994 --> 00:22:30,743
Winner. Winner. The spaghetti
pooch smooch. Nothing better.

316
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:34,039
Thank God we're home. My toes
are even starting to swell. I'm exhausted.

317
00:22:34,106 --> 00:22:36,408
Dogs are barking? No wonder.
It's 4:30 in the morning.

318
00:22:36,475 --> 00:22:38,362
Oh, my God.
I have to be up in three hours.

319
00:22:38,426 --> 00:22:41,176
I'm wide awake. I could go for hours.
I guess I'm nocturnal.

320
00:22:41,244 --> 00:22:44,026
- Oh, yeah? Me too. You should get to bed. How about a nightcap?
- Great.

321
00:22:44,091 --> 00:22:46,034
What the hell.
I haven't pulled an all-nighter in ages.

322
00:22:46,108 --> 00:22:49,556
<i>Let's go to Soho House or Sway
or like a diner or something.</i>

323
00:22:50,589 --> 00:22:52,345
Ow.

324
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:55,348
- Don't you have that big meeting in the morning?
- What big meeting?

325
00:22:55,421 --> 00:22:57,658
Big meeting in the morning
you have to get to?

326
00:22:57,726 --> 00:23:01,883
Oh, that big meeting. Actually, I'm
pretty tired. I should go to bed.

327
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:04,601
- It was great meeting you, Charlie.
- Okay. Good night.

328
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:06,580
I hope we can do this again.

329
00:23:06,655 --> 00:23:09,044
Me too.
I'm getting my keys, all right?

330
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:11,029
- Straight to bed.
- Good night.

331
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:13,624
Night.

332
00:24:26,186 --> 00:24:29,765
- Hey.
- Hey.

333
00:24:29,835 --> 00:24:33,894
- You got in late last night. I didn't even hear you come in.
- I'm just getting in now.

334
00:24:33,963 --> 00:24:37,127
- Sounds like you had a good time.
- It was more than good.

335
00:24:37,195 --> 00:24:39,465
- She's pretty great.
- She's more than great.

336
00:24:39,532 --> 00:24:42,532
Don't blow it. You're off to a strong
start, but a girl can sense a "glommer. "

337
00:24:42,604 --> 00:24:46,183
- She doesn't think I'm a glommer.
- She could and you don't even know it.

338
00:24:46,253 --> 00:24:49,570
- She doesn't think I'm a glommer.
- Staring in her eyes. Glommer.

339
00:24:49,645 --> 00:24:52,329
- I know. L- Read my non-glomming lips.
- A girl doesn't like a guy-

340
00:24:52,397 --> 00:24:55,048
- I know she doesn't- - She could think
you're a glommer and you don't know.

341
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:57,770
You know how I know?
Because I asked her to marry me.

342
00:24:57,839 --> 00:24:59,399
What?

343
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:01,642
And she said yes.

344
00:25:01,711 --> 00:25:03,566
<i>Can you believe it?</i>

345
00:25:03,631 --> 00:25:06,381
<i>We got our blood work done this morning,
and we're going to Vegas this weekend...</i>

346
00:25:06,447 --> 00:25:10,223
- and we want you to be our witness.
- What?

347
00:25:10,288 --> 00:25:14,031
I know. It's amazing. It's like-
It's-It's-It's- It's incredible.

348
00:25:14,097 --> 00:25:17,643
You know what she is? She's
- She's the sun, she's the stars, she's the moon.

349
00:25:17,713 --> 00:25:19,568
She's the jackpot. She's it.

350
00:25:19,633 --> 00:25:22,568
You don't even know her.
She could be an ax murderer for all you know.

351
00:25:22,642 --> 00:25:25,872
Oh, no! I forgot to ask her
if she was an ax murderer.

352
00:25:25,939 --> 00:25:28,939
You know what she isn't? An ax murderer.
You know what she is? Perfect.

353
00:25:29,011 --> 00:25:32,011
<i>She's perfect. Gray, remember what Mom
always used to say?</i>

354
00:25:32,083 --> 00:25:35,215
When it was right, we would know.
Well, trust me. It's right.

355
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:38,546
Mom is divorced for the third time,
and she lives in a commune.

356
00:25:38,612 --> 00:25:41,962
- Stop being so "J" and start being happy for me.
- I am so not "J."

357
00:25:42,037 --> 00:25:45,103
<i>I'm notjealous of you when you're totally
psychologically unstable.</i>

358
00:25:45,173 --> 00:25:47,824
I'm psychologically unstable? I'm psyc-
You're the one that said "Get the ball. "

359
00:25:47,893 --> 00:25:49,966
I said "Get the ball,"
not "Get the ring. "

360
00:25:50,038 --> 00:25:52,526
Gray, we're goin' to Vegas this weekend,
and we are gonna get married.

361
00:25:52,598 --> 00:25:55,860
<i>You can come with us.
I booked you a room. I booked you a flight.</i>

362
00:25:55,926 --> 00:25:58,163
If you come, great.
And if you don't, that's your deal.

363
00:25:58,231 --> 00:26:01,614
- But you know what? I'm gettin' married.
- How does that happen?

364
00:26:01,687 --> 00:26:03,859
One minute you know someone,
the next minute they're so desperate...

365
00:26:03,928 --> 00:26:06,448
- they propose to someone they met 24 hours ago.
- Oh, hey, Gray Ghost.

366
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:10,263
I told Charlie that you'd meet her at
Bloomingdale's tomorrow to try on wedding dresses.

367
00:26:10,328 --> 00:26:14,038
She doesn't have a lot of friends in the
city, and I thought it'd be fun for you two.

368
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:16,952
Forget it.
There's no way that's happening.

369
00:26:17,082 --> 00:26:20,628
It's too frilly.
Something with a little less piff and poof.

370
00:26:20,698 --> 00:26:24,310
Yeah, I think you're right.
Maybe something a little sexier.

371
00:26:24,378 --> 00:26:27,281
If you want sexy, I got sexy.

372
00:26:27,355 --> 00:26:31,479
I mean, I know you kids aren't Little
Bo Peep underneath those dresses.

373
00:26:31,547 --> 00:26:33,882
But...

374
00:26:35,804 --> 00:26:38,423
<i>if you ask me...</i>

375
00:26:38,493 --> 00:26:42,650
a sexy bride just doesn't sit right.

376
00:26:42,717 --> 00:26:45,172
A beautiful bride, yes.

377
00:26:45,245 --> 00:26:47,667
<i>A glowing bride, of course.</i>

378
00:26:47,742 --> 00:26:50,230
<i>But sexy is- I-</i>

379
00:26:50,302 --> 00:26:52,604
I just don't know.

380
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:56,795
Personally, it makes me
a little uncomfortable.

381
00:26:56,863 --> 00:26:59,733
Really? Do you have anything in red
with a slit up to the hip?

382
00:26:59,807 --> 00:27:02,077
- Red!
- She's kidding.

383
00:27:02,144 --> 00:27:04,479
Just something with a little
less piff and poof and no lace.

384
00:27:04,544 --> 00:27:06,933
Oh, no lace?
No problem.

385
00:27:07,009 --> 00:27:09,977
I will be right back.
I just got in a Dior in duchess satin...

386
00:27:10,048 --> 00:27:12,121
<i>that is to die for.</i>

387
00:27:12,193 --> 00:27:14,332
Great.

388
00:27:15,457 --> 00:27:17,432
Are you sure you want to
go through with this?

389
00:27:17,506 --> 00:27:20,670
Did you know that Sam
cheats at Monopoly and he snores?

390
00:27:20,738 --> 00:27:23,227
- And he's got a hairy back.
- I work with animals.

391
00:27:23,299 --> 00:27:25,273
Hairy is a turn-on.

392
00:27:25,347 --> 00:27:29,690
Honestly? I was a goner the moment I saw him
at the dog park.

393
00:27:29,763 --> 00:27:33,987
<i>There's just something about his impish
smile and that twinkle in his eye.</i>

394
00:27:34,052 --> 00:27:35,841
The smile isn't real.
His teeth are capped.

395
00:27:35,909 --> 00:27:38,243
And the twinkle in his eyes?
It's a reflection off his contacts.

396
00:27:38,309 --> 00:27:41,921
- He's as blind as a bat.
- Help me out of this thing. My breasts feel like prisoners.

397
00:27:41,989 --> 00:27:44,094
Set them free.

398
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:50,078
Please tell me you don't
wear stuff like that every day.

399
00:27:50,151 --> 00:27:53,185
What? Lingerie?
I love it.

400
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:55,524
I've spent more on lingerie
than I have on rent.

401
00:27:55,591 --> 00:27:57,926
I haven't bought a new pair
of underwear in over four years.

402
00:27:59,496 --> 00:28:03,042
- Eww. That's kind of gross, huh?
- Why don't you try a dress on?

403
00:28:03,112 --> 00:28:06,429
- No.
- Come on. This one's only 10,000.

404
00:28:06,505 --> 00:28:08,926
No way, no way. Not doin' it.
Never gonna happen.

405
00:28:09,001 --> 00:28:11,719
Come on. It will be fun.
Try it on.

406
00:28:11,786 --> 00:28:16,609
Forget about it. No way. Never happening.
Not gonna... ever happen.

407
00:28:16,682 --> 00:28:19,999
No!
What if I damage it?

408
00:28:20,075 --> 00:28:22,890
Shh. Stay still while
I get this zipper up.

409
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:30,690
Ohh!

410
00:28:33,484 --> 00:28:35,972
Did you cover me? I was at
the Bloomingdale's bridal salon.

411
00:28:36,045 --> 00:28:38,566
- Mr. Phillips came by at 9:30.
- He did?

412
00:28:38,637 --> 00:28:42,598
Yep. But I told him you were at the
gynecologist getting a pap smear. It shut him up.

413
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:45,932
- Good one.
- So what were you doing at the Bloomingdale's bridal salon?

414
00:28:45,999 --> 00:28:48,617
- You know that girl Sam met at the park?
- Don't tell me she's a man.

415
00:28:48,686 --> 00:28:51,436
- No!
- Sorry. I've been reading too many trashy magazines. What?

416
00:28:51,503 --> 00:28:54,221
He asked her to marry him,
and she said yes.

417
00:28:54,288 --> 00:28:57,005
- No.
- Yes! The wedding is this weekend.

418
00:28:57,072 --> 00:28:59,407
- No! - Yes!
- Come on.

419
00:28:59,472 --> 00:29:02,375
The worst thing is, I can't think of
a reason why he shouldn't marry her.

420
00:29:02,448 --> 00:29:05,798
She's smart. She's beautiful.
She's funny. She's amazing.

421
00:29:05,873 --> 00:29:09,583
Oh, please! She's a gold-digging wench trying to
hook her little claws into a resident surgeon...

422
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:12,879
<i>before he makes the big bucks
that she can later get her hands on...</i>

423
00:29:12,946 --> 00:29:16,175
<i>in an ugly, ugly, ugly
divorce settlement...</i>

424
00:29:16,242 --> 00:29:19,058
that her lawyer, who she's probably
schtupping on the side, will handle.

425
00:29:19,123 --> 00:29:20,945
<i>You're not still taping
All My Children every day?</i>

426
00:29:21,011 --> 00:29:24,841
I TiVo it. But seriously, you must be
flipping out that Sam is getting married...

427
00:29:24,916 --> 00:29:27,404
<i>leaving you all alone,
completely single...</i>

428
00:29:27,476 --> 00:29:29,331
<i>with no real prospects
in the future?</i>

429
00:29:29,396 --> 00:29:32,779
<i>That's horrible.
I feel so bad for you.</i>

430
00:29:32,852 --> 00:29:36,235
Promise me if I ever call you when
I'm suicidal, you'll refer the call.

431
00:29:36,309 --> 00:29:37,619
Sure.

432
00:29:41,814 --> 00:29:43,854
Here you go. Can I get some change?
Kidding.

433
00:29:43,926 --> 00:29:46,479
Don't spend it all
on the slots. Red 21.

434
00:29:48,535 --> 00:29:51,121
This place is-This is awesome.

435
00:29:51,192 --> 00:29:53,494
Check this out. This is nuts.
What are these, satin sheets?

436
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:56,909
It's a satin-cotton blend. Possibly Egyptian
cotton if this is the high-roller room.

437
00:29:56,984 --> 00:29:58,839
- Hello?
- Don't get excited.

438
00:29:58,905 --> 00:30:02,069
'Cause you're not doin' any high rollin'
in this bed till tomorrow.

439
00:30:02,137 --> 00:30:03,795
- Says who?
- Oh, says tradition.

440
00:30:03,865 --> 00:30:05,906
You're not supposed to see the bride
until tomorrow morning.

441
00:30:05,977 --> 00:30:09,458
- Where am I gonna stay?
- In the dinky room down the hall that you booked for me.

442
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:12,116
- I'm not staying in a dinky room down the hall.
- Don't be mad, sweetie.

443
00:30:12,186 --> 00:30:14,041
- What?
- I think some tradition is important.

444
00:30:14,106 --> 00:30:16,016
Besides, we haven't been apart
in six whole days.

445
00:30:16,987 --> 00:30:19,605
It'll be fun.
We can miss each other.

446
00:30:19,675 --> 00:30:22,643
- Yeah, all right.
- Hi.

447
00:30:22,716 --> 00:30:25,051
What are you guys-
What are you guys gonna do without me?

448
00:30:25,116 --> 00:30:27,451
- None of your business. See you at the chapel.
- Ow! Violent.

449
00:30:27,517 --> 00:30:31,129
You're gonna get socked.
Ow! Ow!

450
00:30:31,197 --> 00:30:34,711
- You're gonna get a half nelson.
- Ohh.

451
00:30:34,781 --> 00:30:38,044
- Ninja claw! Ohh!
- Hey!

452
00:30:39,454 --> 00:30:42,323
Did you see the bathroom?
It's insane. We have to take a bath.

453
00:30:42,398 --> 00:30:45,017
- Okay, I'll pour the bubbles, you order the bubbly.
- Okay.

454
00:30:45,087 --> 00:30:48,568
- Let's get toasted!
- I can't get too drunk. I am getting married in the morning.

455
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,989
- Exactly.
- Right. I'll order two bottles.

456
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:00,345
Ta-da!

457
00:31:00,417 --> 00:31:04,215
I hope you didn't greet
the room service guy like that.

458
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:08,251
Hmm. Is that why he said
he didn't need a tip?

459
00:31:08,322 --> 00:31:10,297
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

460
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:14,560
Please tell me you work out
three hours a day and eat like a gerbil.

461
00:31:14,627 --> 00:31:17,474
- Never been to a gym, and I'm a macaroni and cheese addict.
- I hate you.

462
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:20,856
If I told you I had acne until I was 21,
would that make you feel better?

463
00:31:20,932 --> 00:31:23,136
- A little.
- Mm-hmm. My nickname was "Connect the Dots. "

464
00:31:25,125 --> 00:31:29,665
I have a toast. To my soon-to-be
sister-in-law and my newfound friend-

465
00:31:29,734 --> 00:31:32,898
That's a bathing suit you're wearing?
You're not embarrassed, are you?

466
00:31:32,966 --> 00:31:38,018
Zits or no zits, my ass hasn't looked that
good since I was 17. I'm not taking off a thing.

467
00:31:38,086 --> 00:31:41,665
- I have a secret I want to share, but I don't know if I should.
- You should.

468
00:31:41,735 --> 00:31:44,004
- You can't tell Sam.
- Scout's honor.

469
00:31:44,071 --> 00:31:47,869
Though I did get kicked out of the Brownies
for stealing money out of my cookie account.

470
00:31:47,944 --> 00:31:50,049
Sam and I haven't had relations yet.

471
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,160
"Relations"?
Relations means my Aunt Betty.

472
00:31:52,232 --> 00:31:54,436
Relations as in intercourse.

473
00:31:54,504 --> 00:31:57,155
I decided to wait,
and I don't know if that was a mistake.

474
00:31:57,224 --> 00:31:59,974
I mean, what if he's too big
or if I'm too small or-

475
00:32:00,042 --> 00:32:04,003
T.M.I. Hasn't anyone ever told you
to test drive a car before you buy it?

476
00:32:14,507 --> 00:32:17,923
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

477
00:32:17,995 --> 00:32:19,883
Thank you very much.
Well...

478
00:32:19,948 --> 00:32:23,244
I love Vegas,
and I am certain that Vegas loves me...

479
00:32:23,308 --> 00:32:25,480
because I lost a bundle
on the slots last night.

480
00:32:25,549 --> 00:32:28,845
- Is this five or six?
- I don't know. I lost count. But I think I'm gonna be sick.

481
00:32:28,909 --> 00:32:31,527
- No, you're not. We're just getting warmed up.
- Oh, geez.

482
00:32:31,597 --> 00:32:37,130
<i>For my next number, I'd like to give
a warm welcome to my surprise guest-</i>

483
00:32:37,198 --> 00:32:41,127
the delightful and charming
Miss Charlie Kelsey.

484
00:32:41,199 --> 00:32:43,141
Yeah!

485
00:32:43,215 --> 00:32:44,873
- You didn't.
- Did.

486
00:32:44,943 --> 00:32:45,991
- You didn't!
- Did.

487
00:32:46,064 --> 00:32:47,111
- Why?
- Ooh!

488
00:32:52,208 --> 00:32:55,143
Come on, honey.
How are you feeling this evening, Charlie?

489
00:32:55,217 --> 00:32:57,127
Like I could throw up at any minute.

490
00:32:57,202 --> 00:32:59,690
<i>Well, that doesn't
sound too pleasant.</i>

491
00:32:59,762 --> 00:33:02,796
I'm sorry. I didn't mean because of you.
L- Can I just sit down, please?

492
00:33:02,867 --> 00:33:06,642
Not too fast. Not too fast. Somebody
has gone through a lot of trouble...

493
00:33:06,707 --> 00:33:09,009
<i>to hear you sing a number
with me tonight.</i>

494
00:33:09,075 --> 00:33:11,312
#Twelve #
There, I sang a number. I'm going home.

495
00:33:11,379 --> 00:33:13,998
<i>Come on, girlfriend. I think we can do this.</i>

496
00:33:14,068 --> 00:33:18,094
We can do this. We can do this.
Come on. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

497
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:38,256
<i>Whoo!</i>

498
00:34:50,913 --> 00:34:53,280
I can't believe I lost
that much money. Don't tell Sam.

499
00:34:53,345 --> 00:34:55,004
- He liked you too.
- Why did that-

500
00:34:55,074 --> 00:34:58,686
- He kept buying me drinks.
- Hey!

501
00:34:58,754 --> 00:35:01,340
Somebody's got my purse.
Somebody's stealing it.

502
00:35:03,619 --> 00:35:07,776
Ah. My wedding shoes.

503
00:35:07,843 --> 00:35:10,210
- I had a good time tonight.
- Me too.

504
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:15,074
You can't go to sleep like that.
You got to get undressed.

505
00:35:15,141 --> 00:35:17,824
- Can't.
- Oh, God.

506
00:35:17,893 --> 00:35:20,642
- All right. I'll help you.
- Mmm!

507
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:22,782
Sleeping.

508
00:35:32,103 --> 00:35:35,365
Oh. Here.
Here's a shirt.

509
00:35:35,431 --> 00:35:37,952
Do you think the woman was mad...

510
00:35:38,024 --> 00:35:41,985
when I asked to see her
husband's tattoo on his tush?

511
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:45,286
Hmm?
It wasn't pretty.

512
00:35:45,353 --> 00:35:49,794
I still don't know
if it was a ship or a- a bunny.

513
00:35:51,338 --> 00:35:54,754
Did I tell you how happy I am
you're gonna be my sister-in-law?

514
00:35:54,827 --> 00:35:58,176
- About 17 times.
- Well, I mean it.

515
00:36:35,344 --> 00:36:37,548
Oh, my God.

516
00:36:37,616 --> 00:36:41,162
Oh, my God!

517
00:36:41,232 --> 00:36:44,364
Oh, my God!

518
00:36:44,433 --> 00:36:48,492
Oh, my God.

519
00:36:53,843 --> 00:36:56,363
I can't believe that just happened.

520
00:36:56,434 --> 00:37:01,836
How can this be happening? You're marrying
my brother tomorrow, for God's sake.

521
00:37:01,907 --> 00:37:06,032
Oh, this can't be happening.

522
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:09,581
This is just a mistake. A meaningless,
too-much-tequila mistake.

523
00:37:15,574 --> 00:37:18,324
Oh, my God!

524
00:37:27,511 --> 00:37:30,773
- God, you're up early.
- Up would mean that I've been down.

525
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:33,775
You're already dressed?

526
00:37:33,848 --> 00:37:37,460
I have a wicked headache.
Can we order some coffee?

527
00:37:37,528 --> 00:37:39,383
Don't you think we should talk?

528
00:37:39,449 --> 00:37:42,231
Okay. Can we talk while I get ready?

529
00:37:42,297 --> 00:37:44,632
- Yeah. Sure. I guess.
- Great.

530
00:37:47,386 --> 00:37:50,615
I can't believe I'm getting married today.
I'm not even nervous.

531
00:37:50,682 --> 00:37:52,625
Good. 'Cause I'm freakin' out.

532
00:37:52,699 --> 00:37:55,830
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.
I can be so insensitive sometimes.

533
00:37:55,899 --> 00:37:57,874
- Are you really upset?
- Yeah.

534
00:37:57,947 --> 00:38:00,631
I would be too if it were my brother.
I'd be freakin' out.

535
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:03,067
Well, I'm past freaking out.
I'm molting.

536
00:38:03,132 --> 00:38:05,075
I know it was one of those crazy,
spontaneous moments...

537
00:38:05,149 --> 00:38:07,004
but don't you feel weird at all?

538
00:38:07,069 --> 00:38:09,011
Not really. I mean,
I know it may seem strange...

539
00:38:09,085 --> 00:38:11,638
- but the whole thing feels really natural.
- Natural?

540
00:38:11,709 --> 00:38:14,427
- Mm-hmm.
- I don't feel natural. I feel subnatural.

541
00:38:14,494 --> 00:38:17,145
In fact, I feel like E.T. I wanna phone home.

542
00:38:17,214 --> 00:38:19,898
But if I phone home, Sam would answer,
and that wouldn't be good.

543
00:38:19,966 --> 00:38:23,130
- Yeah, you were just taken by surprise.
- Surprise?

544
00:38:23,198 --> 00:38:25,850
Gray, come on. Sit down.

545
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:29,335
- Listen to me.
- I'm listening.

546
00:38:29,408 --> 00:38:31,961
Anyone would tell you
the exact same thing.

547
00:38:32,032 --> 00:38:37,270
It is 100% normal to be feeling upset,
sad, freaked out.

548
00:38:37,345 --> 00:38:39,418
In fact, considering everything...

549
00:38:39,489 --> 00:38:41,791
I think you're handling
the whole thing really well.

550
00:38:41,857 --> 00:38:43,930
- Really?
- Absolutely.

551
00:38:44,002 --> 00:38:45,857
Your brother is getting married...

552
00:38:45,922 --> 00:38:48,770
and deep down inside you feel
like you're losing him.

553
00:38:48,834 --> 00:38:50,744
That's why you think
I'm freaking out?

554
00:38:50,819 --> 00:38:53,121
You think I'm having
separation anxiety?

555
00:39:05,125 --> 00:39:07,809
There's only one thing that
can keep a marriage together...

556
00:39:07,877 --> 00:39:11,226
<i>and that is love.</i>

557
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:20,285
Oh.

558
00:39:20,359 --> 00:39:23,425
<i>As the lucky messenger
of our Lord and Savior above...</i>

559
00:39:23,495 --> 00:39:27,041
I look to the two of you
with your bright smiles of devotion...

560
00:39:27,112 --> 00:39:31,586
and promise of commitment
here in the very house of the Lord above!

561
00:39:43,114 --> 00:39:46,049
<i>- This place is nuts.
- But before I continue, I must ask...</i>

562
00:39:46,123 --> 00:39:49,833
if there's anybody here
who has any objection whatsoever...

563
00:39:49,899 --> 00:39:52,071
to the union of these two lovebirds.

564
00:39:54,092 --> 00:39:56,296
I'm sorry. Carry on.
Go ahead.

565
00:39:56,364 --> 00:39:58,219
<i>As I was saying...</i>

566
00:39:58,284 --> 00:40:01,252
if there's anybody here
who has an objection to the union...

567
00:40:01,325 --> 00:40:04,554
of these two love angels,
speak their piece now.

568
00:40:09,325 --> 00:40:11,562
Oh, my God! Look out!

569
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:15,847
Your hiccups gone?

570
00:40:15,919 --> 00:40:18,886
- Actually, yes.
- Good. Great.

571
00:40:18,959 --> 00:40:20,869
Carry on, Minister.
No one objects.

572
00:40:20,943 --> 00:40:23,660
- Right?
- Right.

573
00:40:23,727 --> 00:40:28,649
<i>Then by the power vested in me
by the glorious state of Nevada...</i>

574
00:40:28,721 --> 00:40:32,169
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

575
00:40:32,241 --> 00:40:35,373
You may now kiss the bride, yeah.

576
00:41:05,781 --> 00:41:09,077
Hi. I'd like a hot dog with kraut on
one side and relish on the other...

577
00:41:09,142 --> 00:41:12,405
with ketchup on the kraut and mustard on
the relish, but don't let the two touch.

578
00:41:31,193 --> 00:41:35,122
Sydney, I need to talk to you right away.
This is an emergency. Call me.

579
00:41:39,706 --> 00:41:42,522
<i>Now reach to your right.</i>

580
00:41:42,587 --> 00:41:46,011
Station your left leg
on the rock in the middle.

581
00:41:46,139 --> 00:41:48,889
All right, Gray,
what's really going on?

582
00:41:48,955 --> 00:41:52,272
I canceled a session with someone today
because you said it was an emergency.

583
00:41:52,347 --> 00:41:53,941
- It is.
- Well, then?

584
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:56,630
Take a deep breath-

585
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:59,668
And tell me what's going on.

586
00:41:59,741 --> 00:42:03,735
Three short breaths, one long. That's
what Sam and I did when we were kids...

587
00:42:03,805 --> 00:42:07,929
- and there was something that was difficult to talk about.
- Fine. Then do that.

588
00:42:13,343 --> 00:42:16,791
- I think I'm gay.
- What was that?

589
00:42:16,863 --> 00:42:21,086
- I can't say it again.
- Did you just say "I think I'm gay"?

590
00:42:21,151 --> 00:42:23,999
It's like this. For years,
I thought I was content being single...

591
00:42:24,064 --> 00:42:25,919
and I wasn't really
interested in a relationship.

592
00:42:25,984 --> 00:42:28,799
I thought that when Mr. Right
came into my life, he just would.

593
00:42:28,864 --> 00:42:31,767
<i>He
- He wouldn't need some fancy invitation. He wouldjust arrive.</i>

594
00:42:31,841 --> 00:42:37,276
And then I realized that it's not Mr.
Right I'm waiting for. It's Mrs. Right.

595
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:39,201
<i>- Oh.
- And I think I found her.</i>

596
00:42:39,266 --> 00:42:42,879
And I kissed her-

597
00:42:42,947 --> 00:42:45,118
And I think she kissed me back,
but I'm not sure...

598
00:42:45,186 --> 00:42:48,318
'cause I never kissed a girl before,
and I'm not sure what the rules are.

599
00:42:48,387 --> 00:42:50,754
<i>But I know that I liked it.</i>

600
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:54,203
And I think I like her.
Now I feel nauseous again.

601
00:42:54,277 --> 00:42:56,132
<i>Why do you think you feel nauseous?</i>

602
00:42:56,197 --> 00:43:00,605
Do you think you committed some terrible
sin just because you kissed a girl?

603
00:43:00,677 --> 00:43:03,711
<i>Why? If you're two consenting adults,
what's so terrible about that?</i>

604
00:43:03,782 --> 00:43:06,084
Well, I don't know if she consented.
She was very drunk.

605
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:08,517
Oh, so you believe
you forced her to kiss you?

606
00:43:08,583 --> 00:43:10,722
No. No, not at all.
She kissed me.

607
00:43:10,791 --> 00:43:12,798
<i>- Okay, I'm confused now.
- So am I.</i>

608
00:43:12,871 --> 00:43:15,905
Y- You don't know what it's like.
One day you think you're one thing...

609
00:43:15,975 --> 00:43:17,983
and the next day you realize
you're something else.

610
00:43:18,055 --> 00:43:19,998
<i>I feel like I'm Dorothy in
The Wizard of Oz.</i>

611
00:43:20,072 --> 00:43:22,211
I'm in this new land
and I want to get home...

612
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:24,647
but something is telling me
maybe this is my home.

613
00:43:24,712 --> 00:43:26,567
Maybe I shouldn't click
my heels three times.

614
00:43:26,632 --> 00:43:31,335
Maybe I should just stay here
and be nauseous with the Munchkins.

615
00:43:31,401 --> 00:43:33,955
What scares you most
about this whole thing?

616
00:43:37,162 --> 00:43:40,458
That I'll lose Sam and he'll
never talk to me again.

617
00:43:40,522 --> 00:43:42,530
Well, why would Sam even care?

618
00:43:42,603 --> 00:43:45,473
Call me crazy, but he might be
a little upset I kissed his wife.

619
00:43:45,547 --> 00:43:48,581
Whoa!

620
00:43:50,252 --> 00:43:52,871
- Are you all right?
- Oh, God.

621
00:43:52,941 --> 00:43:55,308
Y- You're looking pale.
Maybe you should take some deep breaths.

622
00:43:55,373 --> 00:43:57,446
- I'm fine.
- Well, I'm not. I'm a wreck.

623
00:43:57,517 --> 00:43:59,688
I haven't slept in three days.
I've taken 42 showers.

624
00:43:59,758 --> 00:44:02,693
I've been to a church, a temple and a mosque,
begging for forgiveness.

625
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:04,260
The Mormon place wouldn't let me in.

626
00:44:04,334 --> 00:44:06,854
I think we need to talk about this
on level ground.

627
00:44:06,926 --> 00:44:08,836
You're not thinking straight.

628
00:44:08,911 --> 00:44:11,977
- No kidding.
- We need to get down.

629
00:44:17,648 --> 00:44:19,721
- Listen to me.
- I'm listening.

630
00:44:19,792 --> 00:44:22,214
- You're not gay.
- I'm not?

631
00:44:22,289 --> 00:44:24,198
- No, you're not.
- How do you know?

632
00:44:24,273 --> 00:44:27,056
- Because it's textbook.
- Insanity?

633
00:44:27,121 --> 00:44:29,871
No. What you did was normal.
It was almost predictable.

634
00:44:29,938 --> 00:44:31,848
You were so jealous of Charlie...

635
00:44:31,922 --> 00:44:34,922
that you subconsciously tried
to sabotage Sam's marriage.

636
00:44:34,995 --> 00:44:37,581
Read my lips.

637
00:44:37,651 --> 00:44:40,466
- You are not gay.
- I'm not?

638
00:44:40,531 --> 00:44:42,058
- No, you're not.
- Are you sure?

639
00:44:42,131 --> 00:44:44,946
- Yes!
- Because my mind is reeling with feelings and emotions...

640
00:44:45,011 --> 00:44:48,624
- and my heart's telling me-
- Actually, our time is up for today.

641
00:44:48,692 --> 00:44:53,165
Now, forget about Sam
and get out there and date.

642
00:44:53,237 --> 00:44:57,231
Your hotel is open for business.
Got it?

643
00:44:57,301 --> 00:45:01,612
Now, I will see you next week
at the batting cages at Chelsea Piers.

644
00:45:01,686 --> 00:45:03,890
Nice climb.

645
00:45:06,582 --> 00:45:11,340
My hotel is open. I have suites, junior suites,
deluxe accommodations available.

646
00:45:12,951 --> 00:45:14,861
- Hey.
- Hey.

647
00:45:14,936 --> 00:45:16,823
- That's a great outfit.
- Thanks.

648
00:45:16,888 --> 00:45:19,408
You know, actually, my grandfather
once told me it's much nicer to say...

649
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:21,968
"That outfit looks
very becoming on you. "

650
00:45:22,041 --> 00:45:24,376
Well, thanks to you and your pops.

651
00:45:24,441 --> 00:45:26,514
Whoa. That coffee smells great.

652
00:45:26,586 --> 00:45:28,441
I'm on this no-caffeine kick
right now...

653
00:45:28,506 --> 00:45:31,223
but I still find myself hanging around
Starbucks trying to get an aroma buzz.

654
00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:33,145
Actually, it's not all coffee.

655
00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:35,382
It's one-third coffee,
one-third cocoa, one-third chai...

656
00:45:35,451 --> 00:45:38,615
with a little bit of steamed soy and
cinnamon and a little bit of nutmeg.

657
00:45:38,683 --> 00:45:40,788
Wow. That's a new one.

658
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:45,431
- What was that?
- Mmm- Nothing.

659
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:48,632
Would you like to have dinner
with me tonight?

660
00:45:48,701 --> 00:45:51,319
Wow. That-That took guts.

661
00:45:51,389 --> 00:45:53,332
Would you?

662
00:45:53,405 --> 00:45:55,260
Sure. What time?

663
00:45:55,326 --> 00:45:58,392
- Um, Raoul's at 10:00.
- All right. Well, I'll see you then.

664
00:45:58,462 --> 00:46:00,634
<i>Great. Are you going up?</i>

665
00:46:00,702 --> 00:46:03,223
- Down.
- Okay. See you tonight.

666
00:46:03,294 --> 00:46:06,907
- Oh!
- Are-Are you okay?

667
00:46:10,528 --> 00:46:13,245
- Is anything sprained? Broken? Maybe we should call a doctor.
- I'm fine, thank you.

668
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:15,167
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

669
00:46:20,641 --> 00:46:22,551
Would you like to have dinner
with me tonight?

670
00:46:22,626 --> 00:46:24,535
Say 8:00 at Raoul's?

671
00:46:28,643 --> 00:46:31,294
- Me?
- Mm-hmm.

672
00:46:31,363 --> 00:46:33,600
Oh, well, you know,
I'm a pretty busy guy.

673
00:46:33,667 --> 00:46:35,772
I'm usually booked up every night.

674
00:46:35,843 --> 00:46:38,015
I'd have to-
I'd have to check my schedule.

675
00:46:38,084 --> 00:46:41,499
- Yeah! Yeah, I think I can do that.
- Great.

676
00:46:41,572 --> 00:46:43,744
Cool.

677
00:46:45,732 --> 00:46:49,475
Hey, Gray. Gray Ghost.
You need a little help?

678
00:46:49,541 --> 00:46:51,396
Oh, you did some serious- Oh!

679
00:46:51,461 --> 00:46:53,316
Damage.
Holy smokes.

680
00:46:53,382 --> 00:46:55,237
Look at you.
What's the occasion?

681
00:46:55,302 --> 00:46:57,277
- I got a couple of dates tonight.
- A couple?

682
00:46:57,350 --> 00:47:00,514
Yeah. I got a 8:00 dinner with one,
and I got a 10:00 dinner with the other.

683
00:47:00,582 --> 00:47:03,299
That's great. Did you get that rash
you always get before you go out?

684
00:47:03,367 --> 00:47:05,701
- No. Why did you remind me?
- Just trying to help.

685
00:47:05,767 --> 00:47:08,386
- Look, is now a good time to talk?
- About what?

686
00:47:08,456 --> 00:47:11,107
I wanted to check in, see when you thought
you might get your own place.

687
00:47:11,176 --> 00:47:13,827
<i>I know we get along great,
and Charlie loves you...</i>

688
00:47:13,896 --> 00:47:16,352
but we are newlyweds so I thought you might-

689
00:47:16,425 --> 00:47:19,011
Do you know how hard it is to find
a rent-controlled place in the city?

690
00:47:19,081 --> 00:47:20,936
Why do I have to be the one to move?

691
00:47:21,001 --> 00:47:23,751
One, the lease is in my name,
and, two, I found the apartment.

692
00:47:23,818 --> 00:47:25,990
'Cause a 90-year-old woman
died on your shift at the hospital.

693
00:47:26,058 --> 00:47:28,808
Her body wasn't even cold before you were
calling the super, claiming to be her nephew.

694
00:47:28,875 --> 00:47:31,559
I didn't hear you complaining. As a
matter of fact, you went to her funeral.

695
00:47:31,627 --> 00:47:34,344
That's 'cause I'm sensitive and not
mean like you. You can't kick me out.

696
00:47:34,411 --> 00:47:37,990
I decorated the whole apartment.
I even grouted the bathroom tiles myself.

697
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:40,133
I'm just saying maybe
you should start looking, that's all.

698
00:47:40,204 --> 00:47:42,277
- I hate you! I really do.
- Hey, hey! Hey!

699
00:47:42,348 --> 00:47:45,578
I can hear you guys yelling from around the block.
What's going on?

700
00:47:45,645 --> 00:47:48,231
- I wasn't yelling. She was yelling.
- I was. I hate him!

701
00:47:48,301 --> 00:47:50,374
- Why? What did he do now?
- Me?

702
00:47:50,446 --> 00:47:52,617
- That's a little presumptuous, don't you think?
- He's kicking me out.

703
00:47:52,685 --> 00:47:54,922
Sam, I thought we spoke about this.

704
00:47:54,990 --> 00:47:57,893
We'll get our own place once I get
a full-time position at the aquarium.

705
00:47:57,967 --> 00:48:00,814
<i>- Until then, it's fine. I actually kind oflike it.
- You do?</i>

706
00:48:00,879 --> 00:48:02,734
Yeah. It's fun.

707
00:48:02,799 --> 00:48:04,807
I love living with the both of you.

708
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:08,557
- What's wrong?
- Shit.

709
00:48:12,752 --> 00:48:14,607
She has a couple of dates tonight...

710
00:48:14,673 --> 00:48:17,423
- and her chest just broke out into hives.
- Oh.

711
00:48:27,315 --> 00:48:29,901
Hey. I think-
I don't know if you remember me...

712
00:48:29,971 --> 00:48:33,747
- but I think you drove me before.
- Oh, you're not very fond of Florida...

713
00:48:33,812 --> 00:48:35,885
and when you refer
to Ginger's companion...

714
00:48:35,956 --> 00:48:38,990
you're not talking
about sushi or wasabi.

715
00:48:39,061 --> 00:48:40,916
Not bad.

716
00:48:40,981 --> 00:48:43,086
- Where's that funny accent of yours from?
- Oh...

717
00:48:43,157 --> 00:48:45,296
a funny place called Scotland.

718
00:48:45,365 --> 00:48:47,951
- What brings you to New York?
- Fame and fortune, of course.

719
00:48:48,021 --> 00:48:51,502
- Hmm. How's that goin'?
- Well, let's see.

720
00:48:51,574 --> 00:48:53,484
I've had two auditions so far.

721
00:48:53,559 --> 00:48:56,788
The first one was for the lead
in a tampon spot-

722
00:48:56,855 --> 00:48:59,157
the role of the tampon,
of course-

723
00:48:59,223 --> 00:49:02,388
and then, uh, the second one
was a voice-over...

724
00:49:02,456 --> 00:49:05,140
for a pest-control infomercial.

725
00:49:05,208 --> 00:49:07,095
And I didn't get that part.

726
00:49:07,161 --> 00:49:11,056
They, uh-They said that they
thought roaches didn't have accents.

727
00:49:11,129 --> 00:49:15,253
I begged to differ,
but I didn't want to seem argumentative.

728
00:49:15,321 --> 00:49:17,427
Hmm.

729
00:49:17,498 --> 00:49:20,465
Don't worry. I'm not contagious.

730
00:49:21,978 --> 00:49:25,274
- I'm not worried.
- What can I say? I am a mess.

731
00:49:26,587 --> 00:49:28,627
You don't look like a mess.

732
00:49:28,699 --> 00:49:30,739
You look as cute as a button.

733
00:49:30,812 --> 00:49:32,852
And buttons aren't messy.

734
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:36,024
Well, looks can be deceiving.

735
00:49:38,621 --> 00:49:41,436
You know, back home in Scotland,
I was captain of the local football team.

736
00:49:41,501 --> 00:49:43,356
- Oh?
- Yeah.

737
00:49:43,421 --> 00:49:45,756
And all my mates used to come to me
with their problems.

738
00:49:45,822 --> 00:49:47,677
They said I was pretty good.

739
00:49:47,742 --> 00:49:49,750
So-

740
00:49:49,822 --> 00:49:53,051
I'm all ears if you want to talk to someone
from the outside, you know?

741
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:57,374
Hmm. That's sweet, but it would take
all night to tackle my laundry list.

742
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,295
Thanks.

743
00:50:00,416 --> 00:50:02,271
- Keep the change.
- Thank you.

744
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,670
I'm crazy about you.

745
00:50:08,993 --> 00:50:11,230
And I'm counting the minutes
until I see you again.

746
00:50:11,297 --> 00:50:13,631
<i>- Hey, that's my line.
- I'm an actor.</i>

747
00:50:13,698 --> 00:50:15,585
We get paid to steal
other people's lines.

748
00:50:17,250 --> 00:50:19,105
See ya.

749
00:50:19,171 --> 00:50:21,986
Uh, seriously, though-

750
00:50:22,051 --> 00:50:24,507
Could I give you
a lift home tonight?

751
00:50:24,579 --> 00:50:28,377
<i>I could come and fetch you about, say,
just before midnight.</i>

752
00:50:28,452 --> 00:50:30,623
No charge.

753
00:50:32,132 --> 00:50:34,915
- Okay.
- Great.

754
00:50:50,566 --> 00:50:53,949
- Excuse me. Can I get another double vodka martini?
- Sure.

755
00:50:54,023 --> 00:50:56,871
With three olives
and a tiny splash of vermouth.

756
00:50:56,935 --> 00:51:00,067
- Okay. - And just a hint-
a hint- of salt on the rim.

757
00:51:00,136 --> 00:51:02,919
- Yeah.
- A little water, please, also?

758
00:51:02,985 --> 00:51:05,156
Of course.
Would you like to hear the specials?

759
00:51:05,224 --> 00:51:07,080
- Please. -
Yeah. - Fantastic.

760
00:51:07,145 --> 00:51:09,250
Tonight we have
a braised lamb shank...

761
00:51:09,321 --> 00:51:11,231
marinated in a rosemary-lime sauce.

762
00:51:11,306 --> 00:51:13,761
<i>That's served
with a creamed pumpkin squash.</i>

763
00:51:13,834 --> 00:51:15,722
We also have
a grilled halibut steak...

764
00:51:15,786 --> 00:51:18,153
<i>in a soy-tamari lemon-zest glaze.</i>

765
00:51:18,218 --> 00:51:21,797
And that comes with grilled seaweed
and an orange and almond salad.

766
00:51:21,867 --> 00:51:23,755
Do we know what we'd like?

767
00:51:23,819 --> 00:51:26,536
<i>Yes. I'll have the halibut with the pumpkin
squash and the rosemary-lime sauce...</i>

768
00:51:26,604 --> 00:51:28,578
and not the soy-tamari-lemon stuff.

769
00:51:28,652 --> 00:51:32,166
Oh, that does sound good, doesn't it?
Yeah, they don't come together.

770
00:51:32,237 --> 00:51:34,659
- Well, can you make 'em come together?
- I'll try.

771
00:51:34,733 --> 00:51:36,642
Try hard.
And I'll have the duck confit.

772
00:51:36,717 --> 00:51:39,205
Excellent.
Coming right up.

773
00:51:39,277 --> 00:51:42,344
Conrad, I'm impressed. You duked the guy.
I didn't know you had it in you.

774
00:51:42,414 --> 00:51:44,519
<i>There's a lot in me
that you don't know about.</i>

775
00:51:44,590 --> 00:51:48,901
<i>I'm a burnin'sex machine
just waitin'to be used and abused by you.</i>

776
00:51:48,975 --> 00:51:51,397
<i>The harder, the better.</i>

777
00:51:51,471 --> 00:51:53,708
Check, please.

778
00:51:56,112 --> 00:51:57,999
...as much as I can,
but it's not good.

779
00:51:58,064 --> 00:51:59,920
<i>- How?
- I don't know.</i>

780
00:51:59,985 --> 00:52:02,352
So wait.
Let me just get this straight.

781
00:52:02,417 --> 00:52:04,392
<i>So you love Capra...</i>

782
00:52:04,465 --> 00:52:06,287
you run in the park, you tango...

783
00:52:06,354 --> 00:52:09,616
<i>you live for Italy,
and you hate asparagus.</i>

784
00:52:09,682 --> 00:52:11,755
Are you sure we weren't
separated at birth?

785
00:52:11,826 --> 00:52:14,576
- You don't play poker, do you?
- I've been playing with the same buddies...

786
00:52:14,643 --> 00:52:16,498
every Thursday since I was 15.

787
00:52:16,563 --> 00:52:18,473
I'm a five-card stud girl, myself.

788
00:52:18,547 --> 00:52:20,554
Closed hand, deuces wild.

789
00:52:20,627 --> 00:52:23,083
I love it when you talk dirty.

790
00:52:24,532 --> 00:52:26,474
This is actually fun.

791
00:52:26,548 --> 00:52:29,036
<i>I have to admit. I usually
dread the whole first-date thing.</i>

792
00:52:29,108 --> 00:52:31,247
You know, the awkward lulls
in the conversation.

793
00:52:31,317 --> 00:52:34,100
<i>Then the anxious pain in the pit
of my stomach when I can't wait...</i>

794
00:52:34,165 --> 00:52:37,514
for the night to end,
but I'm feeling no pain, no lulls.

795
00:52:37,589 --> 00:52:40,437
Yeah, I'm feeling rather
painless and "lull-less" myself.

796
00:52:40,502 --> 00:52:43,088
- Cheers to that.
- Cheers.

797
00:52:47,191 --> 00:52:51,152
But, uh, I do want to be honest
with you about something.

798
00:52:51,224 --> 00:52:53,941
Oh, no. Honesty on the first date.
That has a bad ring to it.

799
00:52:55,929 --> 00:52:58,831
See, I was so flattered with the way
you asked me out in the elevator.

800
00:52:58,905 --> 00:53:01,491
- I know. Don't tell me. You're married.
- Actually, I'm not married...

801
00:53:01,561 --> 00:53:04,278
but Stewart and I have been
living together for years.

802
00:53:05,753 --> 00:53:08,121
<i>- Yeah.
- Stewart-</i>

803
00:53:08,186 --> 00:53:10,968
- Am I a moron or what?
- Don't be so hard on yourself.

804
00:53:11,035 --> 00:53:13,457
- I can't help it. I'm hopeless.
- You're not.

805
00:53:13,530 --> 00:53:16,116
- I'm a walking Dear Abby column.
- Hold on a minute, darling.

806
00:53:16,187 --> 00:53:18,970
All you need is some space...

807
00:53:19,035 --> 00:53:21,524
some fresh air and some perspective.

808
00:53:21,596 --> 00:53:25,077
Fresh air, space and perspective
in New York City.

809
00:53:25,148 --> 00:53:27,799
Stick with me.

810
00:53:29,436 --> 00:53:31,673
<i>This is unbelievable.</i>

811
00:53:31,741 --> 00:53:33,684
<i>Isn't this fantastic?</i>

812
00:53:33,758 --> 00:53:35,962
Yeah, it's one of the perks
of the job.

813
00:53:36,030 --> 00:53:38,070
I giveJimmy the doorman
free rides...

814
00:53:38,142 --> 00:53:40,117
and he lets me come up here
whenever I fancy.

815
00:53:40,191 --> 00:53:42,525
I love this city.

816
00:53:42,591 --> 00:53:45,176
<i>Oh, me too.</i>

817
00:53:45,247 --> 00:53:48,728
<i>You know, it's funny,
'cause sometimes, up here...</i>

818
00:53:48,799 --> 00:53:51,320
everything is so tall and grand.

819
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:54,295
Even my biggest problems,
you know...

820
00:53:54,368 --> 00:53:56,889
suddenly seem very wee.

821
00:53:58,497 --> 00:54:03,865
Within seconds
they just melt away like tiny dewdrops.

822
00:54:03,938 --> 00:54:07,321
You're so sweet.
Thanks for cheering me up.

823
00:54:10,947 --> 00:54:13,151
Ah, it's my pleasure.

824
00:54:27,525 --> 00:54:30,427
Sorry. I couldn't resist.

825
00:54:30,501 --> 00:54:32,869
I've been wanting to do that...

826
00:54:32,934 --> 00:54:35,268
from the moment I saw your face
in my rearview mirror.

827
00:54:35,334 --> 00:54:38,087
<i>What's wrong?</i>

828
00:54:38,214 --> 00:54:41,248
Oh, Christ. Was it awful?
L- I'm a wee bit out of practice.

829
00:54:41,319 --> 00:54:43,905
No, it wasn't awful.
You're a really nice kisser.

830
00:54:43,975 --> 00:54:46,757
Well, thank you.

831
00:54:47,719 --> 00:54:49,575
Your lips seem...

832
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:52,607
nice and supple too.

833
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:56,615
<i>But I'm sensing that, uh-</i>

834
00:54:58,761 --> 00:55:02,755
Your heart's not doing
the Riverdance thing that mine is.

835
00:55:02,826 --> 00:55:04,735
Gordy, I'm sorry.

836
00:55:05,930 --> 00:55:08,265
- Oh.
- For what?

837
00:55:08,330 --> 00:55:10,185
For being me.

838
00:55:10,251 --> 00:55:12,225
Ah, there's nothing wrong with that.

839
00:55:12,298 --> 00:55:14,852
I happen to think
you're pretty dandy.

840
00:55:23,084 --> 00:55:24,939
So you're gay.

841
00:55:25,005 --> 00:55:27,176
Big deal.

842
00:55:27,245 --> 00:55:29,798
- How did you know?
- Just a feeling, I suppose.

843
00:55:31,309 --> 00:55:35,271
That and the fact that you haven't shut up
about Charlie all night.

844
00:55:37,390 --> 00:55:40,140
And every time you mentioned
her name you got that little...

845
00:55:41,102 --> 00:55:43,885
sparkle thing in your eyes.

846
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,585
- What am I gonna do now?
- Ah.

847
00:55:48,656 --> 00:55:50,511
That's easy.

848
00:55:50,576 --> 00:55:52,431
You're gonna move on
with your life...

849
00:55:52,496 --> 00:55:54,351
start being the person
that you're supposed to be...

850
00:55:54,417 --> 00:55:57,679
instead of wasting your time
pretending to be someone that you're not.

851
00:55:57,745 --> 00:55:59,655
I mean, crikey.

852
00:55:59,730 --> 00:56:02,480
Are you not exhausted?

853
00:56:02,546 --> 00:56:05,263
I am, but it's so much easier
to keep pretending.

854
00:56:05,330 --> 00:56:09,225
Oh, but easy is so bloody boring!

855
00:56:10,419 --> 00:56:12,306
Isn't it?

856
00:56:15,348 --> 00:56:18,644
As your newfound friend...

857
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:22,189
I am prescribing a remedy for you.

858
00:56:25,909 --> 00:56:28,048
That's part of the remedy.

859
00:56:29,269 --> 00:56:31,179
This is the remedy.

860
00:56:32,342 --> 00:56:35,442
"I am woman. Hear me roar. "

861
00:56:36,502 --> 00:56:39,601
Helen Reddy.
She'll sort you out.

862
00:56:52,697 --> 00:56:55,697
<i>There are a few things
I'd like to know about you too.</i>

863
00:56:55,769 --> 00:56:58,159
<i>All right. What would you like to know?</i>

864
00:56:58,233 --> 00:57:00,089
<i>Oh, just about anything.</i>

865
00:57:00,154 --> 00:57:02,259
<i>Things you like.
Things you don't like.</i>

866
00:57:02,330 --> 00:57:06,225
<i>Where you went to school. Who was your
first beau. What you want out oflife.</i>

867
00:57:06,299 --> 00:57:09,878
<i>- Mmm. That's a tall order. Where shall I start?
- Oh, my God.</i>

868
00:57:09,947 --> 00:57:12,981
<i>- Till the Clouds Roll By.
- I guess I like what everyone likes.</i>

869
00:57:13,052 --> 00:57:15,540
That's one of my favorite
all-time movies.

870
00:57:15,612 --> 00:57:17,652
I know every line and every step.

871
00:57:17,724 --> 00:57:19,895
Me too.

872
00:57:24,894 --> 00:57:27,382
- Will you dance with me?
- Oh, no, thank you. No.

873
00:57:27,454 --> 00:57:29,461
- Go ahead and dance with her.
- No, no, I can't.

874
00:57:32,734 --> 00:57:34,589
Will you dance with me?

875
00:57:34,654 --> 00:57:37,589
I sure will, baby.
Watch this.

876
00:57:37,663 --> 00:57:39,769
- Do you know this dance?
- Yeah.

877
00:58:46,985 --> 00:58:49,057
<i>What's goin' on?</i>

878
00:58:49,129 --> 00:58:51,464
Nothing.
Absolutely nothing.

879
00:58:51,529 --> 00:58:53,668
I hate when you ask so many questions.
It's so annoying.

880
00:58:53,737 --> 00:58:55,647
Sorry. You okay?

881
00:58:55,722 --> 00:58:58,854
- I'm fine.
- All I asked was, what's going on?

882
00:58:58,923 --> 00:59:02,306
Nothing. I'm going to bed, okay? Got
any questions you want to ask about that?

883
00:59:06,539 --> 00:59:08,874
<i>She must be ovulating.</i>

884
00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:11,307
I heard that. Huh?

885
00:59:14,285 --> 00:59:16,619
- How you doin'?
- How you doin'?

886
00:59:20,110 --> 00:59:22,249
Mmm. She's the best.

887
00:59:22,318 --> 00:59:25,515
Strong, independent, feisty.

888
00:59:25,582 --> 00:59:28,135
<i>- Who are you talking about?
- Who else? Queen Oprah.</i>

889
00:59:28,206 --> 00:59:31,523
Oprah. Oprah the Great.
Oprah- I love her.

890
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:33,541
Do you understand
that I'm obsessed with her?

891
00:59:33,615 --> 00:59:36,583
Like, I think she is so great
that she should start her own religion.

892
00:59:36,656 --> 00:59:39,242
<i>I love her so much
that if she and Steadman...</i>

893
00:59:39,313 --> 00:59:41,255
couldn't have children
and needed a little bit of help...

894
00:59:41,329 --> 00:59:43,184
I would surrogate a child for them.

895
00:59:43,249 --> 00:59:45,770
That's right, I would have Oprah's baby.
That's how much I love her.

896
00:59:45,841 --> 00:59:48,077
Wow. That's a lot of love.

897
00:59:48,146 --> 00:59:51,441
Last night I was so inspired after watching
her show about loving your body that-

898
00:59:51,506 --> 00:59:53,361
- Do you know what I did today?
- What?

899
00:59:53,426 --> 00:59:55,663
- I quit Weight Watchers.
- Get out!

900
00:59:55,731 --> 00:59:58,382
Yeah! Can you believe it?
I quit. Fergie, "smergie. "

901
00:59:58,451 --> 01:00:00,818
<i>I hate fiber.
I like Mallomars.</i>

902
01:00:00,883 --> 01:00:03,218
And if Dereck isn't going to love me
for the tiny amount...

903
01:00:03,283 --> 01:00:05,226
of cellulite I have
on the back of my thighs...

904
01:00:05,299 --> 01:00:08,595
- then fuck him- Screw that guy.
- Yeah.

905
01:00:08,660 --> 01:00:11,443
This is the package, okay?
It's exactly the same under the wrapping.

906
01:00:11,508 --> 01:00:15,186
This is the package.
No exchanges, no returns.

907
01:00:15,253 --> 01:00:16,431
- Yes.
- Right?

908
01:00:16,502 --> 01:00:17,679
- Hot!
- Thank you.

909
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:19,605
<i>I mean, why does
our society push us...</i>

910
01:00:19,670 --> 01:00:22,004
<i>to be perpetually uncomfortable
with who we are?</i>

911
01:00:22,070 --> 01:00:24,012
<i>It's so messed up.
You wanna know why?</i>

912
01:00:24,087 --> 01:00:26,575
Here. This is why.
"Boost your buttocks in five days. "

913
01:00:26,647 --> 01:00:29,014
"Luscious liposuction. "
"The flawless face-lift. "

914
01:00:29,079 --> 01:00:30,967
That's why.
Enough is enough.

915
01:00:31,031 --> 01:00:33,934
<i>We need to stop letting
society and-and media...</i>

916
01:00:34,008 --> 01:00:36,080
<i>and our religious leaders
delegate who we are.</i>

917
01:00:36,152 --> 01:00:38,422
You're amazing,
and I'm even more amazing...

918
01:00:38,489 --> 01:00:42,351
and anybody who doesn't get it
can go screw themselves!

919
01:00:46,489 --> 01:00:49,140
That felt fantastic.

920
01:00:50,490 --> 01:00:53,109
<i>Spewing is a wonderful thing.</i>

921
01:00:53,179 --> 01:00:55,862
Forget spinning classes.
They should have spewing classes.

922
01:00:55,930 --> 01:00:59,543
That's what they should have.

923
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:05,395
Where are you going? You have a
creative meeting in five minutes.

924
01:01:14,910 --> 01:01:17,627
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

925
01:01:17,694 --> 01:01:19,996
- That page wasn't from you, was it?
- It was.

926
01:01:20,062 --> 01:01:22,780
This better be good. I'm about to
get prepped for surgery. What is it?

927
01:01:22,847 --> 01:01:24,757
- I need to tell you something.
- I'm listening.

928
01:01:28,031 --> 01:01:29,624
Maybe you should just
get prepped for surgery-

929
01:01:29,695 --> 01:01:31,550
Maybe you should perform the surgery.
I'll come back later.

930
01:01:31,616 --> 01:01:33,755
Gray.

931
01:01:34,816 --> 01:01:36,671
I have to tell you something.
It's not easy.

932
01:01:36,737 --> 01:01:39,071
It's really major,
and I don't know how to say it.

933
01:01:39,136 --> 01:01:42,585
- Why don't you take three short
breaths and one- - One long.

934
01:02:04,324 --> 01:02:06,976
- I'm gay.
- What?

935
01:02:07,045 --> 01:02:09,696
- As in Marvin.
- What?

936
01:02:09,765 --> 01:02:12,154
As in, take the "R" out of"Gray,"
and- Bingo!

937
01:02:15,878 --> 01:02:17,765
Oh.

938
01:02:30,408 --> 01:02:33,311
- That's great.
- What about it is great?

939
01:02:33,385 --> 01:02:36,036
- It's great that you're coming out.
- Don't tell me you knew.

940
01:02:36,105 --> 01:02:38,439
<i>Gray, of course I knew.</i>

941
01:02:38,506 --> 01:02:40,415
How can you know
when I didn't even know?

942
01:02:40,489 --> 01:02:43,489
I'm smarter than you. I've known since second
grade, when you had a crush on Mrs. Wertheimer...

943
01:02:43,561 --> 01:02:46,245
- and tried to look up her skirt.
- She was cute, wasn't she?

944
01:02:46,314 --> 01:02:47,875
Tell you, I'm proud of you, Gray.

945
01:02:47,947 --> 01:02:52,104
- This is a big moment. This is huge.
- It's big, all right...

946
01:02:52,171 --> 01:02:54,921
but there's one other thing
I haven't told you, and it's even bigger.

947
01:02:54,987 --> 01:02:58,850
Bigger. Yeah.
It can't possibly be bigger than this.

948
01:02:58,924 --> 01:03:01,793
- Well, I guess it depends on how you see it.
- What is it?

949
01:03:03,661 --> 01:03:06,279
- I'm in love with her.
- Who?

950
01:03:06,349 --> 01:03:07,659
- Her.
- Who her?

951
01:03:07,725 --> 01:03:10,180
- Your wife.
- Whose wife?

952
01:03:10,253 --> 01:03:12,196
Yours. I'm in love with Charlie.

953
01:03:12,269 --> 01:03:15,052
- Is this your idea of a bad joke?
- I would never joke about it.

954
01:03:15,118 --> 01:03:17,420
I love the way she talked
and walked and looked and felt...

955
01:03:17,486 --> 01:03:20,454
but it really kicked in
after we kissed.

956
01:03:22,575 --> 01:03:24,430
Kissed?

957
01:03:24,495 --> 01:03:26,830
What do you mean, kissed?
Are you saying you kissed my wife?

958
01:03:26,896 --> 01:03:28,620
Only once,
and technically she wasn't your wife.

959
01:03:28,688 --> 01:03:31,208
It was the night
before your wedding.

960
01:03:33,681 --> 01:03:36,016
I'm sorry.
Look, I never expected this to happen.

961
01:03:36,081 --> 01:03:38,023
Just tell me off.
Just yell at me.

962
01:03:38,097 --> 01:03:41,065
I know I'm a terrible person.
I'm a terrible, terrible person.

963
01:03:41,138 --> 01:03:44,172
Gray, I want you to pack up your shit
and get it out of the apartment...

964
01:03:44,243 --> 01:03:46,250
by the time I get home tonight,
because we're done.

965
01:03:46,323 --> 01:03:48,265
All right? We're done.

966
01:04:32,345 --> 01:04:34,200
<i>There has to be a reason.</i>

967
01:04:34,265 --> 01:04:36,404
Why would she move out
without talking to us about it...

968
01:04:36,474 --> 01:04:38,329
or even telling us
where she was going?

969
01:04:38,394 --> 01:04:40,533
- Why are you so concerned?
- What is that supposed to mean?

970
01:04:40,602 --> 01:04:42,228
It's not supposed to mean anything.

971
01:04:42,299 --> 01:04:44,438
- You seem obsessed about my sister, that's all.
- That's ridiculous.

972
01:04:44,507 --> 01:04:46,362
- Is it?
- I'm just worried about her.

973
01:04:46,427 --> 01:04:48,183
Aren't you happy we'll
have the place to ourselves?

974
01:04:48,251 --> 01:04:50,357
- Of course I'm happy.
- All right then.

975
01:04:50,428 --> 01:04:52,435
- That's not the issue.
- What's the issue?

976
01:04:52,508 --> 01:04:54,418
Did you guys get
in a fight or something?

977
01:04:54,493 --> 01:04:56,435
- What aren't you telling me?
- I'm not telling you anything.

978
01:04:56,509 --> 01:04:58,516
- Is there something you want to tell me?
- Like what?

979
01:04:58,588 --> 01:05:00,443
I don't know.
You tell me.

980
01:05:00,509 --> 01:05:04,568
Sam, what's going on?
You're acting weird. You love your sister.

981
01:05:04,638 --> 01:05:07,672
Yes, I love my sister. How about you?
Do you love my sister?

982
01:05:07,742 --> 01:05:09,881
Of course I love your sister.
I think she's great.

983
01:05:09,951 --> 01:05:11,806
"Great. " How great?

984
01:05:11,871 --> 01:05:14,140
- What are you getting at?
- Nothing. Nothing.

985
01:05:14,207 --> 01:05:17,338
You know what? I'm late.
I gotta go, okay? I'll see you later.

986
01:05:17,407 --> 01:05:19,262
Sam?

987
01:06:03,910 --> 01:06:07,707
So as you can see, the consumers love
to think of nothing but C-Pro.

988
01:06:07,782 --> 01:06:10,204
- B-Pro.
- What?

989
01:06:10,279 --> 01:06:13,924
- B-Pro. You said "C-Pro. "
- I did?

990
01:06:13,991 --> 01:06:16,326
Yeah, you said C-Pro.
I'm very sorry.

991
01:06:16,392 --> 01:06:19,359
Would you excuse me for a minute?
I have to get a glass of water.

992
01:06:19,432 --> 01:06:21,091
Take your time.

993
01:06:24,552 --> 01:06:27,553
I'll be back in just one minute.
I'll... be back.

994
01:06:27,626 --> 01:06:31,521
Gray, hang in there. You're doing just fine.

995
01:06:31,594 --> 01:06:33,896
<i>- No, I'm not doing fine. I'm the Titanic.
- No!</i>

996
01:06:33,962 --> 01:06:35,850
- Yes.
- You just gotta-You gotta get focused.

997
01:06:35,914 --> 01:06:38,435
You gotta center yourself,
and you gotta march back in there...

998
01:06:38,506 --> 01:06:40,362
and you show them who's the boss.

999
01:06:40,427 --> 01:06:42,566
<i>Who's the Boss? I hated that show.
I love Alyssa Milano.</i>

1000
01:06:42,635 --> 01:06:45,483
I don't like Tony Danza, and Judith Light
had really weird hair, but-

1001
01:06:45,548 --> 01:06:47,817
Gray! You gotta focus.
Focus, okay?

1002
01:06:47,884 --> 01:06:51,114
You gotta get out of your head
and get into your body.

1003
01:06:51,180 --> 01:06:52,871
Get out of your head
and into your body.

1004
01:06:52,941 --> 01:06:54,796
Get out of your head
and into your body.

1005
01:06:54,861 --> 01:06:56,869
Get out of your head.
Get out of your head.

1006
01:06:56,941 --> 01:06:59,330
Get out of your head
and into your body.

1007
01:06:59,406 --> 01:07:01,741
Take a deep breath.
Feel your feet on the ground.

1008
01:07:01,806 --> 01:07:04,462
Center yourself.

1009
01:07:04,589 --> 01:07:06,084
- And go.
- Go.

1010
01:07:06,158 --> 01:07:07,914
Go.

1011
01:07:07,982 --> 01:07:10,917
<i>Gimme a "P."Gimme an "R."</i>

1012
01:07:10,990 --> 01:07:12,932
Gimme an "O."

1013
01:07:13,006 --> 01:07:15,974
What's that spell?

1014
01:07:16,047 --> 01:07:18,797
<i>B- Pro!</i>

1015
01:07:18,864 --> 01:07:21,101
<i>Yeah! Whoo!</i>

1016
01:07:23,664 --> 01:07:25,519
Lana, what the hell are you doing?

1017
01:07:25,585 --> 01:07:28,335
I promoted Miss Valentine to creative
executive on the Bartlett account...

1018
01:07:28,401 --> 01:07:31,216
because I thought it would be best
to show Julia two perspectives.

1019
01:07:31,281 --> 01:07:33,900
- You mean the one of her tits and the one of her ass?
- Gray!

1020
01:07:33,970 --> 01:07:36,337
I'm sure that Lana
has 36 double-D ideas...

1021
01:07:36,401 --> 01:07:40,231
<i>for the account, and I'll just give you
your privacy to fondle through them.</i>

1022
01:07:43,282 --> 01:07:45,738
I think that was a brilliant comeback.
Clever and descriptive.

1023
01:07:45,811 --> 01:07:47,721
I'm sure it cost me my job.

1024
01:07:47,795 --> 01:07:50,130
Well, with copy like that,
they should be begging you to stay.

1025
01:07:50,195 --> 01:07:52,683
Here. Drink that
while it's still hot.

1026
01:07:54,133 --> 01:07:58,443
That, young lady,
is my granny's secret recipe.

1027
01:07:58,517 --> 01:08:01,900
Mmm! This is so good.
What's in this?

1028
01:08:01,973 --> 01:08:05,650
Oh, uh, tea, milk, honey
and a wee bit of nutmeg.

1029
01:08:05,718 --> 01:08:08,533
<i>Gordy, you are amazing.</i>

1030
01:08:08,598 --> 01:08:11,827
<i>You barely know me
and you're such a great friend.</i>

1031
01:08:11,895 --> 01:08:15,605
You're gonna make
some lucky girl very happy one day.

1032
01:08:17,079 --> 01:08:18,967
So are you.

1033
01:08:23,033 --> 01:08:24,888
God, everything is so complicated.

1034
01:08:24,953 --> 01:08:27,855
If it was 30 years ago,
I could just move away and join a convent.

1035
01:08:27,929 --> 01:08:31,672
Those outfits are so hideous.

1036
01:08:32,697 --> 01:08:34,999
You know, if you want
my advice-

1037
01:08:35,066 --> 01:08:38,995
and I don't suppose you do,
but I'm going to give it to you anyway.

1038
01:08:39,066 --> 01:08:42,645
- I think you have to go and talk to Charlie.
- About what?

1039
01:08:42,715 --> 01:08:44,504
You have to tell her the truth.

1040
01:08:44,571 --> 01:08:46,000
<i>- I can't do that.
- Yes, you can.</i>

1041
01:08:46,076 --> 01:08:48,083
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

1042
01:08:48,156 --> 01:08:51,288
I mean, for all you know,
she might feel the same way about you.

1043
01:08:51,356 --> 01:08:54,106
Come on. Her name is Charlie.
You've got a shot.

1044
01:08:54,172 --> 01:08:56,180
<i>But you won't know that
until you talk to her.</i>

1045
01:08:56,253 --> 01:08:59,253
What if I made it up? What if she
doesn't even remember the kiss?

1046
01:08:59,325 --> 01:09:02,075
What if you go through
your entire life saying, "What if?"

1047
01:09:02,142 --> 01:09:03,898
What happens if she does
feel the same way?

1048
01:09:03,966 --> 01:09:05,755
What about Sam?
He'll never talk to me again.

1049
01:09:05,822 --> 01:09:08,343
- He doesn't talk to you now.
- That's just 'cause he hates me.

1050
01:09:08,415 --> 01:09:10,325
And do you foresee that
ever changing?

1051
01:09:10,399 --> 01:09:13,782
- He can't hate me forever.
- Mm-hmm. Just drink your tea.

1052
01:09:17,504 --> 01:09:19,359
This is so good.

1053
01:09:19,424 --> 01:09:21,367
Are you sure this is just tea,
nutmeg and honey?

1054
01:09:21,441 --> 01:09:24,376
Wee bit of whiskey.

1055
01:09:24,449 --> 01:09:27,034
- Would you like some shortbread?
- Mmm!

1056
01:09:27,105 --> 01:09:28,960
What kind of shortbread is this?

1057
01:09:29,026 --> 01:09:31,546
Mmm, short.

1058
01:09:31,682 --> 01:09:33,984
<i>God, they're so beautiful
and magical and peaceful.</i>

1059
01:09:34,050 --> 01:09:35,905
<i>Will they have babies here?</i>

1060
01:09:35,970 --> 01:09:39,386
I don't think so.
That's Lucy, and she's Ethel.

1061
01:09:39,459 --> 01:09:41,314
- They're an item?
- Mm-hmm.

1062
01:09:41,379 --> 01:09:43,386
They never spend a moment apart.
It's very common.

1063
01:09:43,459 --> 01:09:46,722
I'm actually doing a study on
homosexuality among mammals.

1064
01:09:46,788 --> 01:09:48,577
- You are?
- I'm concentrating on whales...

1065
01:09:48,645 --> 01:09:51,547
but did you know
that over 50% of elephants are gay?

1066
01:09:51,621 --> 01:09:54,174
- How do they test that?
- They pipe in the Village People...

1067
01:09:54,245 --> 01:09:56,253
over loudspeakers
and watch their feet.

1068
01:09:57,765 --> 01:10:00,635
I'm kidding.

1069
01:10:00,710 --> 01:10:02,620
So where've you been hiding?

1070
01:10:02,694 --> 01:10:06,175
I've left three messages and no answer,
and Sam won't say a word.

1071
01:10:06,246 --> 01:10:08,385
I'm sorry.
I've just been a little preoccupied.

1072
01:10:08,455 --> 01:10:10,397
Anything you want to talk about?

1073
01:10:10,472 --> 01:10:14,498
Do you remember that night we spent together
in Las Vegas before you got married to Sam?

1074
01:10:14,568 --> 01:10:17,438
Barely. I mean, I remember
having a great time...

1075
01:10:17,512 --> 01:10:20,546
but I think you got me too drunk
to remember anything else.

1076
01:10:21,865 --> 01:10:23,720
Why? Did I say something
really stupid?

1077
01:10:23,785 --> 01:10:27,047
- It's not what you said.
- God. What did I do?

1078
01:10:27,113 --> 01:10:30,147
I don't know if you did anything.
It might have just been me.

1079
01:10:30,218 --> 01:10:33,383
- Oh, my God. I remember.
- You do?

1080
01:10:33,451 --> 01:10:37,029
- Yes. I'm such an idiot.
- No, you're not.

1081
01:10:37,099 --> 01:10:39,074
How could you let
your brother marry me?

1082
01:10:39,147 --> 01:10:41,482
I didn't know if you were conscious
of what was going on.

1083
01:10:41,548 --> 01:10:43,588
Of course I was conscious.
I'm so embarrassed.

1084
01:10:43,660 --> 01:10:46,082
Don't be.
I'm so relieved we're talking about it.

1085
01:10:46,156 --> 01:10:48,677
- Was I completely off-key?
- What?

1086
01:10:48,748 --> 01:10:50,636
I sounded like a cat in heat,
didn't I?

1087
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:53,002
Is that what you think
we're talking about?

1088
01:10:53,070 --> 01:10:55,110
Oh, God.
Did I do something else?

1089
01:11:01,870 --> 01:11:04,838
- No. That was it.
- Are you sure?

1090
01:11:04,911 --> 01:11:07,050
<i>- Yeah.
- Tell the truth.</i>

1091
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:09,225
Did you try to convince Sam
not to marry me?

1092
01:11:09,296 --> 01:11:12,558
There was no convincing him.
Trust me. If I could have, I would have.

1093
01:11:13,712 --> 01:11:16,909
You know, every morning
I wake up before Sam does...

1094
01:11:16,977 --> 01:11:19,279
and I just watch him.

1095
01:11:19,345 --> 01:11:21,996
I just lie there and stare.

1096
01:11:24,113 --> 01:11:26,535
And I love the way his nose wrinkles
when he's dreaming...

1097
01:11:26,610 --> 01:11:29,610
and the little purring sound that he makes
when he's about to wake up.

1098
01:11:29,682 --> 01:11:32,879
<i>And the way that he keeps his hand
on my thigh the whole night...</i>

1099
01:11:32,946 --> 01:11:36,362
just to let me know that he's there.

1100
01:11:36,435 --> 01:11:39,599
<i>And I know it may seem crazy...</i>

1101
01:11:39,667 --> 01:11:42,832
but love is crazy, isn't it?

1102
01:11:42,901 --> 01:11:45,683
It sure is.

1103
01:12:24,634 --> 01:12:26,609
- Hey.
- Hey.

1104
01:12:26,682 --> 01:12:30,457
I was cleaning out the closet.
I found Dad's old projector.

1105
01:12:32,027 --> 01:12:33,882
Is that you?

1106
01:12:33,947 --> 01:12:36,184
Yeah.

1107
01:12:36,252 --> 01:12:38,107
Cute little surgeon, wasn't I?

1108
01:12:42,173 --> 01:12:45,370
<i>You're so lucky.
I never had a brother or sister.</i>

1109
01:12:49,534 --> 01:12:51,443
Oh!

1110
01:12:59,199 --> 01:13:01,338
<i>I don't know what's going on
between the two of you...</i>

1111
01:13:01,407 --> 01:13:04,506
but you have to work it out, Sam.

1112
01:13:04,575 --> 01:13:06,518
Just talk to her.

1113
01:13:18,594 --> 01:13:20,569
- You wanted to see me?
- Oh, yeah. Gray.

1114
01:13:20,642 --> 01:13:24,832
Seems Julia wasn't thrilled with the way
our last presentation went.

1115
01:13:24,898 --> 01:13:26,753
Why don't you go ahead and fire me?

1116
01:13:26,819 --> 01:13:29,088
I don't need to be embarrassed or
humiliated or patronized anymore.

1117
01:13:29,155 --> 01:13:32,865
- Actually, I was gonna give
you a promotion, but- - What?

1118
01:13:32,931 --> 01:13:35,834
I asked Jordan to make you the executive
creative director on my account...

1119
01:13:35,908 --> 01:13:39,553
and to give you free rein
to do whatever you want.

1120
01:13:39,621 --> 01:13:42,338
Carrie told me that the cheerleader idea
was yours.

1121
01:13:42,405 --> 01:13:45,123
<i>I think you have great ideas.</i>

1122
01:13:45,190 --> 01:13:48,539
You just haven't been given the freedom
to explore them fully.

1123
01:13:48,614 --> 01:13:53,535
I like your energy,
your spunk, your candidness...

1124
01:13:53,606 --> 01:13:55,974
<i>and I think
with the right support...</i>

1125
01:13:56,039 --> 01:13:58,592
you're gonna give me
exactly what I'm looking for.

1126
01:13:58,663 --> 01:14:00,518
Wow!

1127
01:14:00,583 --> 01:14:03,813
<i>- I don't know what to say.
- Sorry to interrupt, Gray...</i>

1128
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:07,492
<i>but your 12::00 meeting with Brother
Electronics is in the small conference room.</i>

1129
01:14:07,561 --> 01:14:10,376
Oh, I don't have a 12:00 meeting
with Brother Electronics.

1130
01:14:10,441 --> 01:14:12,580
<i>They said they confirmed it
with your office.</i>

1131
01:14:12,649 --> 01:14:14,853
Please, go ahead.
I don't want to hold you up.

1132
01:14:14,921 --> 01:14:16,961
Thank you so much.
You will not be sorry.

1133
01:14:17,033 --> 01:14:19,652
Thank you, Mr. Phillips.
I will not let you down.

1134
01:14:23,691 --> 01:14:27,107
Isn't she adorable?

1135
01:14:31,372 --> 01:14:34,372
Hi! Sorry I'm late.
I didn't have you in my book.

1136
01:14:37,741 --> 01:14:39,651
Hey.

1137
01:14:41,197 --> 01:14:43,434
<i>See, you forgot your toothbrush...</i>

1138
01:14:43,502 --> 01:14:47,943
and I figured a toothbrush that
is part hard, part soft bristles...

1139
01:14:48,014 --> 01:14:49,989
must be hard to come by.

1140
01:14:52,654 --> 01:14:54,826
Is that all?
You just came to give me my toothbrush?

1141
01:14:54,895 --> 01:14:57,448
And to say I'm sorry.

1142
01:14:57,519 --> 01:15:00,519
I overreacted-
Little bit. Not a lot. Little bit.

1143
01:15:00,591 --> 01:15:02,479
After all, you have to admit...

1144
01:15:02,544 --> 01:15:05,741
it's a pretty exceptional situation, right?

1145
01:15:05,808 --> 01:15:07,947
- Uh-huh.
- On the other hand...

1146
01:15:08,016 --> 01:15:09,871
I'm not quite sure
why I got so surprised...

1147
01:15:09,937 --> 01:15:11,824
'cause if you think about it...

1148
01:15:11,889 --> 01:15:15,502
it's almost inevitable that you and I
would end up liking the same girl, isn't it?

1149
01:15:15,570 --> 01:15:17,709
You're acting
- You're acting very rational. It's too rational.

1150
01:15:17,778 --> 01:15:19,633
You used to do this
when we were kids.

1151
01:15:19,698 --> 01:15:21,553
Then I'd turn around
and you'd tackle me.

1152
01:15:21,618 --> 01:15:23,757
I should be getting my knees
in the lock-down position.

1153
01:15:23,827 --> 01:15:25,933
You know, Gray-

1154
01:15:26,004 --> 01:15:29,266
Gray, you're not just my sister.
You're my best friend.

1155
01:15:29,332 --> 01:15:31,754
You know that, right?

1156
01:15:31,828 --> 01:15:34,130
Being without you
I feel like one half of me is missing.

1157
01:15:34,196 --> 01:15:36,051
Lately I've been feeling
very lopsided.

1158
01:15:36,116 --> 01:15:39,183
- Oh, Sam.
- Just 'cause you're totally gay...

1159
01:15:39,253 --> 01:15:42,155
and in love with my wife doesn't mean
we can't work things out.

1160
01:15:43,189 --> 01:15:45,677
<i>Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!</i>

1161
01:15:45,750 --> 01:15:49,166
<i>- Oh, my God!
- Ooh. Now, this is good.</i>

1162
01:15:49,239 --> 01:15:51,443
I knew it wasn't me.
I knew it wasn't me!

1163
01:15:56,824 --> 01:16:00,469
- Oh, my-
- Gray!

1164
01:16:00,536 --> 01:16:03,155
Gray! Gray!

1165
01:16:03,225 --> 01:16:05,363
How ya doin'? How ya doin'?
Nothin' to see here, folks.

1166
01:16:05,433 --> 01:16:07,255
Put your eyes back in your heads.

1167
01:16:16,218 --> 01:16:18,074
<i>Hey, what-</i>

1168
01:16:18,139 --> 01:16:21,554
- What are you doing?
- I wanna die right now, in this elevator.

1169
01:16:21,627 --> 01:16:23,995
- I never wanna see another human being ever again.
- No. Look.

1170
01:16:24,060 --> 01:16:25,915
Gray, listen to me.
This is not as bad-

1171
01:16:25,980 --> 01:16:27,835
Who cares what those people think?

1172
01:16:27,900 --> 01:16:30,803
I care. They're probably calling
Jerry Springer right now as we speak.

1173
01:16:30,877 --> 01:16:33,365
No. No, they're not.
I don't think he has a show anymore.

1174
01:16:33,437 --> 01:16:35,925
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry for what?

1175
01:16:35,997 --> 01:16:38,233
For having to be related to me.

1176
01:16:38,302 --> 01:16:41,019
- Gray, don't be ridiculous.
- Oh, I just feel-

1177
01:16:41,086 --> 01:16:43,388
Gray, look. You're just-
You're just coming out, okay?

1178
01:16:43,454 --> 01:16:46,040
- I am never coming out of this elevator.
- This is probably...

1179
01:16:46,110 --> 01:16:48,314
the biggest revelation
of your entire life.

1180
01:16:48,382 --> 01:16:50,238
It's normal to be going nuts.

1181
01:16:50,303 --> 01:16:52,212
<i>- It's normal.
- I don't feel normal.</i>

1182
01:16:52,287 --> 01:16:55,070
I'm sick and tired of everyone saying
it's normal, it's typical, it's ordinary.

1183
01:16:55,136 --> 01:16:57,176
I don't feel any of those things.

1184
01:16:57,248 --> 01:16:59,518
Well, how do you feel?

1185
01:17:02,753 --> 01:17:04,793
- Lonely.
- Why?

1186
01:17:04,865 --> 01:17:07,931
Because I'm never gonna be able
to walk down the street...

1187
01:17:08,001 --> 01:17:10,042
holding hands with my partner...

1188
01:17:10,114 --> 01:17:12,961
without the rest of the world
giving us a look.

1189
01:17:13,027 --> 01:17:15,842
I may never have the wedding
that I once dreamed of...

1190
01:17:15,907 --> 01:17:18,242
and I may never have children...

1191
01:17:18,307 --> 01:17:20,380
and one day, when I die...

1192
01:17:20,452 --> 01:17:23,103
people will never give
as much respect to my grieving lover...

1193
01:17:23,172 --> 01:17:25,823
as if she were my husband.

1194
01:17:35,173 --> 01:17:37,475
Gray...

1195
01:17:37,542 --> 01:17:40,445
<i>it's not as if you made a choice.</i>

1196
01:17:40,518 --> 01:17:42,690
That's what terrifies me.

1197
01:17:42,758 --> 01:17:46,020
It's so much easier
to be someone else.

1198
01:17:46,086 --> 01:17:49,665
Do you remember
when we were kids-

1199
01:17:49,735 --> 01:17:52,288
<i>you would have been
about six-</i>

1200
01:17:52,359 --> 01:17:55,881
and Dad came home to tell Mom
he was leaving her for Mrs. Rosemont.

1201
01:17:56,008 --> 01:17:57,797
Yeah.

1202
01:17:57,864 --> 01:18:00,898
<i>Remember we stayed
in the closet all night...</i>

1203
01:18:00,969 --> 01:18:04,744
just cuddled up like
two little mice and...

1204
01:18:05,770 --> 01:18:07,777
listened to their whole fight.

1205
01:18:11,691 --> 01:18:13,600
I was...

1206
01:18:16,011 --> 01:18:18,378
so angry.

1207
01:18:18,443 --> 01:18:21,673
I was... hurt.
I was just-

1208
01:18:23,019 --> 01:18:25,769
I was mad, and I wanted to go out there
and kick his ass...

1209
01:18:25,837 --> 01:18:29,699
- and you remember what you said to me?
- Hmm.

1210
01:18:29,773 --> 01:18:32,294
You were just six...

1211
01:18:32,366 --> 01:18:35,628
but you said it was gonna be okay...

1212
01:18:35,694 --> 01:18:37,767
that Dad was not gonna live a lie...

1213
01:18:37,838 --> 01:18:40,227
that he was gonna try
and be happy...

1214
01:18:42,351 --> 01:18:45,221
and that everyone
deserved to be happy.

1215
01:18:45,295 --> 01:18:47,183
I said that?

1216
01:18:47,247 --> 01:18:49,582
- Yeah.
- I was so profound.

1217
01:18:52,432 --> 01:18:54,734
Why are you being so nice to me?

1218
01:18:54,801 --> 01:18:57,965
- You should hate me.
- For what? For having good taste?

1219
01:18:58,961 --> 01:19:00,848
You never have to worry about it.

1220
01:19:00,914 --> 01:19:03,085
I mean, she's completely,
madly, passionately...

1221
01:19:03,153 --> 01:19:05,968
like cow-jump-over-the-moon
in love with you.

1222
01:19:06,034 --> 01:19:08,009
- Really?
- Yeah.

1223
01:19:09,106 --> 01:19:11,856
That's great... for me.
Not so great for you.

1224
01:19:11,923 --> 01:19:15,272
But you're not gonna
make me feel guilty for this are you?

1225
01:19:15,347 --> 01:19:17,486
Mm-mmm.

1226
01:19:17,555 --> 01:19:19,443
Gray, you know what?

1227
01:19:19,508 --> 01:19:21,996
You can't expect the first girl
that you fall in love with...

1228
01:19:22,068 --> 01:19:23,923
to love you back.

1229
01:19:23,988 --> 01:19:25,844
That's-That's not how it works.

1230
01:19:25,909 --> 01:19:29,226
That would be the equivalent
of settling down when you were age 12.

1231
01:19:29,301 --> 01:19:32,019
You haven't gone
through gay puberty yet.

1232
01:19:34,710 --> 01:19:37,744
- I think I'm ready to come out.
- To everyone?

1233
01:19:37,814 --> 01:19:40,302
- No. Of the elevator.
- Of the elevator.

1234
01:19:48,056 --> 01:19:50,260
I should have broken up
with Dereck ages ago.

1235
01:19:50,328 --> 01:19:52,183
I am having the best time.

1236
01:19:52,249 --> 01:19:54,900
- So what about you? Have you met anyone yet?
- Not yet.

1237
01:19:54,969 --> 01:19:57,271
Really? Girls should be lining up
around the block for you.

1238
01:19:57,337 --> 01:19:59,192
- What's your type?
- I don't have a type.

1239
01:19:59,257 --> 01:20:01,745
I mean, like the basics.
Like, brunette, blonde, short, tall?

1240
01:20:01,817 --> 01:20:03,672
It depends, I guess.

1241
01:20:03,738 --> 01:20:05,909
- Funny. You need funny.
- Funny would be good.

1242
01:20:05,978 --> 01:20:07,888
- And stylish. No Birkenstocks.
- That's for sure.

1243
01:20:07,963 --> 01:20:09,818
And for the love of God,
don't wind up...

1244
01:20:09,883 --> 01:20:11,923
with one of those ladies
who doesn't believe in waxing.

1245
01:20:11,995 --> 01:20:14,417
- You're killing me.
- Can I ask you a question?

1246
01:20:14,492 --> 01:20:16,347
- Yeah.
- Have you ever been attracted to me?

1247
01:20:16,412 --> 01:20:18,267
- No.
- Really?

1248
01:20:18,332 --> 01:20:20,187
- No.
- Not even a little?

1249
01:20:20,253 --> 01:20:22,325
- No.
- Huh. Oh.

1250
01:20:22,396 --> 01:20:25,244
Not even last year, when I was in shape
after taking those Pilates classes?

1251
01:20:25,309 --> 01:20:27,829
Or last week when I wore that pink
MarcJacobs dress to work...

1252
01:20:27,901 --> 01:20:29,756
and you told me how cute I looked?

1253
01:20:29,821 --> 01:20:32,724
<i>You looked so cute. You are cute,
but, you know, not cute that way, cute.</i>

1254
01:20:32,798 --> 01:20:34,653
Hmm. Wow.
That's so depressing.

1255
01:20:34,718 --> 01:20:37,817
It's not like I'm into girls,
but if I was a girl who was into girls...

1256
01:20:37,887 --> 01:20:40,026
I'd definitely be into me,
'cause I think I'm a catch.

1257
01:20:40,095 --> 01:20:42,648
You are a catch,
but, uh, I don't know, you're not my type.

1258
01:20:42,719 --> 01:20:44,694
Hmm. But you said
you don't have a type.

1259
01:20:44,767 --> 01:20:47,768
- You gotta stop talking about this.
- All right.

1260
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:49,946
Wait. Don't you usually have
therapy at lunchtime on Thursdays?

1261
01:20:50,017 --> 01:20:52,832
Oh, my God.
I'm so late. Shoot.

1262
01:20:54,337 --> 01:20:57,534
Okay. You know, I don't really want to go,
so watch this.

1263
01:21:00,802 --> 01:21:02,657
Sydney, it's Gray.

1264
01:21:02,722 --> 01:21:05,243
I'm sorry I'm late, but I don't
wanna go to the batting cages...

1265
01:21:05,315 --> 01:21:07,835
and I don't wanna go rock climbing
or bowling or anywhere with you...

1266
01:21:07,907 --> 01:21:09,817
'cause I'm feeling
really good about myself...

1267
01:21:09,891 --> 01:21:12,739
and I don't think you're a very good
therapist for me, so you're fired.

1268
01:21:12,804 --> 01:21:14,692
Thank you, and have a nice day.

1269
01:21:14,756 --> 01:21:17,374
- That was crazy.
- Can you believe I just did that?

1270
01:21:17,444 --> 01:21:19,354
That was amazing.

1271
01:21:19,429 --> 01:21:22,397
Do you want to get a mani-pedi
before we go back to work?

1272
01:21:22,469 --> 01:21:24,356
- Sure. I need a pedicure.
- Yeah.

1273
01:21:24,422 --> 01:21:27,139
What if I dyed my hair red?
Would you be attracted to me then?

1274
01:21:27,206 --> 01:21:29,116
- Yes.
- Really?

1275
01:21:29,190 --> 01:21:32,005
- You're hot.
- Ooh, mah-moo!

1276
01:21:45,992 --> 01:21:48,513
I can't go through with this.

1277
01:21:48,585 --> 01:21:51,881
- Yes, you can.
- Why do I have to?

1278
01:21:51,945 --> 01:21:54,564
Because you're gay,
and you have to start behavin' like it.

1279
01:21:54,634 --> 01:21:56,968
What am I supposed to do?
Wear a sign on my forehead?

1280
01:21:57,033 --> 01:21:58,976
No, but you haven't
had sex with a woman yet...

1281
01:21:59,050 --> 01:22:01,254
and, you know,
that's like being black...

1282
01:22:01,322 --> 01:22:03,711
and never having listened
to theJackson Five...

1283
01:22:03,787 --> 01:22:06,209
or being Jewish
and never having a knish...

1284
01:22:06,283 --> 01:22:09,131
or being Indian and never
having had a curry or being-

1285
01:22:09,196 --> 01:22:11,717
Or being Scottish
and not keeping your mouth shut?

1286
01:22:11,787 --> 01:22:13,992
- I suppose so. Come on.
- Hi.

1287
01:22:17,869 --> 01:22:19,909
Sorry. No men allowed.

1288
01:22:19,981 --> 01:22:21,836
Wh- Isn't that against the law?

1289
01:22:21,901 --> 01:22:24,040
- And I'm only goin' in for a wee minute.
- Yeah.

1290
01:22:24,110 --> 01:22:27,885
- No exceptions. No men.
- Forget it.

1291
01:22:27,951 --> 01:22:29,860
Well, just go in by yourself.

1292
01:22:29,934 --> 01:22:32,138
I can't go in by myself.
Are you kidding?

1293
01:22:32,206 --> 01:22:34,149
I have an idea.

1294
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:41,960
I would like an Apricot Sour, please.

1295
01:22:43,568 --> 01:22:46,023
I'll have a Cosmo.
Not too much cranberry.

1296
01:22:46,096 --> 01:22:48,104
And a touch of lemon
and a squeeze of lime.

1297
01:22:48,177 --> 01:22:50,032
And a little bit of sugar
on the rim.

1298
01:22:50,097 --> 01:22:52,618
Comin' up.

1299
01:22:52,690 --> 01:22:54,599
Apricot Sour?

1300
01:22:54,674 --> 01:22:56,944
I thought that was what you women drank,
for Christ's sakes.

1301
01:22:57,010 --> 01:23:01,004
- One of your eyelashes is coming off.
- Give me a mirror, quick.

1302
01:23:06,323 --> 01:23:08,942
Hi. Can I buy you a drink?

1303
01:23:12,372 --> 01:23:16,366
Oh, no.
Um, I don't drink.

1304
01:23:16,437 --> 01:23:18,510
See, but thanks.

1305
01:23:19,605 --> 01:23:21,460
You don't?

1306
01:23:27,254 --> 01:23:29,906
Shut up.

1307
01:23:32,727 --> 01:23:35,346
This is quite tasty, actually.

1308
01:23:42,904 --> 01:23:45,326
Let's get out of here.
I'm not gonna meet anyone here.

1309
01:23:45,401 --> 01:23:47,157
Hey, give it a minute.

1310
01:23:57,179 --> 01:23:59,252
<i>Oh, my God.
It's Julia Bartlett.</i>

1311
01:23:59,323 --> 01:24:02,105
- Quick, quick. I gotta get out of here.
- Why?

1312
01:24:02,171 --> 01:24:05,947
- Can't have her see me in a gay bar.
- Hello. Is there anybody in?

1313
01:24:07,772 --> 01:24:09,845
No. Her? You think?

1314
01:24:09,917 --> 01:24:11,859
Gray, did your mom ever tell you...

1315
01:24:11,933 --> 01:24:14,137
what your I.Q. Scores were?

1316
01:24:16,542 --> 01:24:18,876
- Hi, Gray.
- Hello.

1317
01:24:18,941 --> 01:24:20,600
- It's nice to see you.
- Nice to see you too.

1318
01:24:20,670 --> 01:24:23,387
I'm just taking a break
from working on your account.

1319
01:24:23,454 --> 01:24:26,138
Gray, I didn't come over here
to check up on you.

1320
01:24:30,111 --> 01:24:32,795
Um, hello.

1321
01:24:32,864 --> 01:24:34,457
Uh, my name's Georgette.

1322
01:24:34,528 --> 01:24:35,805
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

1323
01:24:35,872 --> 01:24:37,912
And, uh, lovely.

1324
01:24:37,984 --> 01:24:40,603
And I'm just gonna
leave you two to, uh-

1325
01:24:40,673 --> 01:24:43,968
to, uh- to catch up on everything.

1326
01:24:44,033 --> 01:24:45,725
- Mmm. Lovely.
- Don't go.

1327
01:24:45,794 --> 01:24:48,128
Yeah, it was lovely to see you too.
Really nice. Really nice.

1328
01:24:48,193 --> 01:24:51,423
Dutch way-Three kisses.
So, uh-

1329
01:24:51,490 --> 01:24:54,305
Fine. It's fine.

1330
01:24:54,371 --> 01:24:58,594
I'm fine. You're fine. Everything's gonna
be fine, and I've got to go now. Bye.

1331
01:25:04,996 --> 01:25:07,233
You really surprised me
the other day.

1332
01:25:07,300 --> 01:25:09,821
I had no idea you were gay.

1333
01:25:09,893 --> 01:25:12,708
That makes two of us.

1334
01:25:12,773 --> 01:25:14,748
You're not just coming out, are you?

1335
01:25:14,821 --> 01:25:17,243
Put it this way.

1336
01:25:17,318 --> 01:25:20,133
My hotel's been closed
for a long time...

1337
01:25:20,198 --> 01:25:22,948
but tonight's the grand opening.

1338
01:25:23,014 --> 01:25:25,186
There have been a few
fake openings...

1339
01:25:25,255 --> 01:25:27,972
but tonight's the real deal.

1340
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:32,513
L- No, I don't understand.

1341
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:37,186
Yes, I'm just coming out.

1342
01:25:39,081 --> 01:25:41,830
I don't think anyone in here will mind.

1343
01:25:49,546 --> 01:25:52,230
You really are adorable.

1344
01:25:52,299 --> 01:25:54,601
I always thought so.

1345
01:25:54,667 --> 01:25:56,522
Really?

1346
01:25:56,587 --> 01:26:01,192
From day one, in that little
cream, pin-striped suit you were wearing.

1347
01:26:02,220 --> 01:26:04,162
I like that suit too.

1348
01:26:04,236 --> 01:26:07,051
I think I got it at,
uh, Banana Republic.

1349
01:26:07,116 --> 01:26:09,899
Or maybe it was, uh,
Emporio Armani.

1350
01:26:09,965 --> 01:26:12,300
Actually, it could have been Barneys,
but the shirt was from Bloomies.

1351
01:26:12,366 --> 01:26:17,484
<i>Listen. I have this
beautiful bottle of cognac...</i>

1352
01:26:17,550 --> 01:26:20,453
<i>that I just brought back
from France, and I would-</i>

1353
01:26:20,526 --> 01:26:23,276
- I'd love to share it with you.
- You have it here with you?

1354
01:26:23,343 --> 01:26:25,765
No. My place.

1355
01:26:25,839 --> 01:26:29,135
- Oh.
- Central Park West and 85th.

1356
01:26:32,785 --> 01:26:35,655
Uh, okay, well-

1357
01:26:35,728 --> 01:26:37,638
I like cognac.

1358
01:26:37,713 --> 01:26:40,364
<i>I like cognac.
I like brandy too.</i>

1359
01:26:40,433 --> 01:26:42,921
Usually I have a little cognac
with a splash of brandy on the side.

1360
01:26:42,994 --> 01:26:45,361
I have brandy too.

1361
01:27:10,901 --> 01:27:13,684
- Give it up. You're toast.
- You're gonna eat those words.

1362
01:27:14,646 --> 01:27:16,239
<i>Come on, Gray! Come on!</i>
