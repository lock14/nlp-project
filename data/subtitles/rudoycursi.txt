1
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:46,170
A while back, some wanker told me

2
00:00:46,255 --> 00:00:48,965
the most beautiful game ever invented

3
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:52,218
began with the severed head of a soldier.

4
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:56,472
And his enemy's brutal kick.

5
00:00:56,849 --> 00:00:59,475
The first goal ever, unofficially,

6
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:03,438
was scored when the head flew
between two trees.

7
00:01:03,856 --> 00:01:07,859
"Dreadful!" I said.
"That depends," said the wanker.

8
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:13,531
"Dreadful for the goalkeeper,
but for the striker, it was glorious."

9
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:42,935
Know the difference between
a banana loader and a donkey?

10
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,061
-What?
-You don't know?

11
00:01:44,146 --> 00:01:46,689
-Nope.
-The donkey's well hung!

12
00:01:46,774 --> 00:01:48,274
Fucking A, Rudo!

13
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:52,236
Don't run, Tato.

14
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:54,572
-You'll bruise the bananas.
-You said go faster.

15
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:56,824
These are for export.

16
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:03,372
So goes our life, so goes our love

17
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:06,459
It's a never ending story

18
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:08,628
Stop with the yodeling, asshole.

19
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:11,839
Like an April evening. Love to love...

20
00:02:11,924 --> 00:02:14,050
You know the words "shut up"?

21
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,010
Will you shut up now, jackass?

22
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:17,804
Asshole!

23
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:19,472
You're wearing me out!

24
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:23,893
Hey, shorty! Wait up!

25
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,229
Tato! Wait up!

26
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:31,734
Tato! Tell that dwarf to wait!

27
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:33,820
Hurry up! Grab on!

28
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:39,659
Hold it still, shithead!

29
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:41,828
You got it! Grab on!

30
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,083
Hold it still!

31
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,167
Grab on!

32
00:02:48,252 --> 00:02:50,503
Wait, damn it!

33
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:52,505
That's it, grab the little stick, Beto!

34
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:59,136
In sports as in life,
individual effort means nothing

35
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:01,806
if it doesn't support a group effort.

36
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:05,184
Teamwork can only be understood as

37
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:08,771
a principle of generosity, one for all.

38
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:12,316
That's the spirit that unites us
and makes us brothers.

39
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:15,945
Don't play dumb. Where is it?

40
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,114
I lost it last night, mango.

41
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:22,326
Have you lost your mind?
I need my blender, Beto!

42
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:24,787
Sorry, my system failed.

43
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,957
It always fails!

44
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:31,127
I want my blender!

45
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:36,132
You'll live like a queen once
my system gets going, Toña.

46
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:40,386
Meanwhile we're screwed!
How am I gonna blend?

47
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,139
Big deal, ask my mom to borrow hers.

48
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:47,226
You ask her! Don't bet what's not yours!

49
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:49,854
Bet that stupid game of yours!

50
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:53,482
It's Campitos' game.
You just said don't bet what isn't mine.

51
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:55,943
Then sell it.
You waste all day playing with him.

52
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:57,236
It's called quality time.

53
00:03:57,321 --> 00:03:58,821
I want my blender back!

54
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:04,994
More rice? You can finish later, Nadia.
Get some more tortillas.

55
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,122
Why bother? They're too chewy!

56
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:11,792
Now, dear, you already had a dozen.

57
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:14,128
And they all tasted like shit.

58
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:15,922
Where'd you buy them, Toña?

59
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:17,840
Same place as always.

60
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:21,469
So who's dumber? The one who bought
them, or the one who served them?

61
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:25,431
Don't talk like that to my wife
and mom, Arnulfo! Apologize!

62
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:27,183
Did they run out of fresh tortillas?

63
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:31,479
My gun's bigger than yours!
Apologize to my mom!

64
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:33,689
Better leave your dad alone!

65
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:35,775
This cop ain't nobody's father!
Not even the twins.

66
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:39,320
He's only been here a couple of years!
Say you're sorry.

67
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:40,655
I'm waiting.

68
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,449
Say you're sorry, damn it!

69
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:49,205
I'm going to Texas.

70
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:51,666
-What's that, Son?
-You're going where?

71
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:55,753
Up north, with some guys from Chiapas.

72
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:57,213
To pick fruit?

73
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,507
No, I'm gonna make it big,

74
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:00,883


as a singer.

75
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:11,227
All wetbacks make minimum wage,
dickhead!

76
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:14,897
Cuco's got a cousin. He does radio in Texas.

77
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:18,150
Son, you sing real nice,

78
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:22,321
but Beto's right.

79
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:24,532
Then how will I ever build you your house?

80
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:28,327
You'll wind up singing in the street.

81
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:30,705
I'm the one who'll build the house,
like always,

82
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:32,498
-with my savings.
-What savings?

83
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:35,334
Friends, come make
your dreams come true...

84
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:38,504
Wish we had a phone
so we could win that raffle.

85
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,256
Yeah.

86
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:42,800
Like, how much could we buy?

87
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:45,177
A shitload, I guess.

88
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,015
The car's real nice.

89
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:52,768
We'd give it to my mom.

90
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:58,315
Geez, you're always giving her what's ours.

91
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,027
Well, Arnulfo never gives her shit.

92
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:02,236
So what about your brother?

93
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,781
He's good for nothing. Takes after his dad.

94
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:08,659
Yours wasn't so hot either, right?

95
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:16,876
You're my platonic love, forbidden fruit

96
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,379
I know we don't have a chance

97
00:06:20,464 --> 00:06:23,424
to ever be together

98
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:26,260
but I worship you

99
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:29,472
from afar, little darling

100
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:43,527
I'll take Maya Vega over the car any day.
She's a fox.

101
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:46,947
Don't say that, moron!
Maya's the most fragrant flower,

102
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:50,367
the sweetest nectar,
the loveliest woman on Earth.

103
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:56,165
Well said, poet. So what'll it be?
Tea For Two, or Goodbye Girl?

104
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:04,006
Game time, you lazy fuck!

105
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:05,299
Hey, asshole!

106
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,636
Fuck off!

107
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:17,394
Man, you reek. Stay clear of the ref.
He'll kick you out.

108
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,855
Buy me a beer, okay?

109
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:22,358
You're wasted.

110
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,444
-Pay you back later.
-Sweat it off.

111
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:31,575
Here's where I enter the story.

112
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:37,248
Hello, chaps.
I'm Dario Vidali, better known as "Baton."

113
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:39,458
Baton?

114
00:07:39,543 --> 00:07:44,421
That little wand conductors use.
I'm a talent scout.

115
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:45,965
There's lots of talent here!

116
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:47,091
-Really.
-What's up?

117
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:48,259
Buggered, old chap.

118
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:52,179
My tire's bungled
and there's no spare in the boot.

119
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:54,056
Is there a shop nearby?

120
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:57,601
Boot? You keep spares in your boots?

121
00:07:57,686 --> 00:08:00,688
No... I need a place to fix it.

122
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:04,150
-There's a mechanic in El Naranjo.
-Yeah.

123
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:06,235
Could you help me take the tire to be fixed?
You'll be well paid.

124
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,487
No can do. Game time, Tato.

125
00:08:08,572 --> 00:08:12,533
Trees on the cliffside

126
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:16,245
But I paid the alimony. Don't drag
the kids into this, I'm begging you.

127
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,247
Quiet, mate, I can't hear...

128
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,915
Not watered by the flowery river

129
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:21,167
Hello?

130
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:26,338
I'm never there?
I took them fishing three months ago...

131
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:28,257
Hello?

132
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:31,510
No signal. I'm losing reception...

133
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:39,393
Hey, here's a flat. Fix it, okay?
It belongs to the gentleman.

134
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:42,438
-Thanks, chaps, I'm very grateful.
-Sure thing, any time.

135
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:45,357
Booger, wait up!

136
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:46,650
What do you think, sir? How's my singing?

137
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:50,237
Stellar. There's a tad extra for you in my tip.

138
00:08:50,322 --> 00:08:53,282
-Tato, the game's starting!
-Coming!

139
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,619
Let me give you my info, to stay in touch.

140
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:59,371
-Of course.
-See ya.

141
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:07,046
Laddie, come here. Do me a favor.

142
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:13,260
Bring me an ice cold six-pack.
Cold as a nun's tit.

143
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:34,198
-String, kite, string!
-Who's that dancing fellow who just scored?

144
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:36,659
-What do you mean?
-That's Tato Verdusco!

145
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,793
-And who's the goalkeeper?
-The goalie?

146
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:48,545
-Tato's brother.
-"Rudo" Beto Verdusco.

147
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,672
Rudo?

148
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,217
I see.

149
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:56,720
He's totally ruthless.
But he always plays fair.

150
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:59,348
Yes, I'm sure.

151
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:02,601
Dirt fields are a paradox.

152
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:07,815
The poorest places are where
you'll find the diamond in the rough.

153
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:11,193
Flawless, pure. Miraculous.

154
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:31,714
Tato!

155
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:34,800
Hey, did you see it?

156
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:38,137
Congratulations, smashing, well done!

157
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:40,389
Mr. Baton, I'm so glad you stayed!

158
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:44,560
Like I said,
I scout and represent soccer talent.

159
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:47,980
-You're not in the music biz?
-Not music. Soccer.

160
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,523
Soccer? Really?

161
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:55,112
Perhaps you've heard of Luis Guzman,
Alex Garcia, Butterball Peralta...

162
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:56,447
Of course we have.

163
00:10:56,531 --> 00:11:00,617
I discovered those lads.
Butterball, for example.

164
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:04,913
I found him in a little town in Chile.
Now he's a star.

165
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:09,251
I represent them all, and then some.

166
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:11,670
Let's cut to the chase.

167
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:18,594
I saw you chaps play and I'll be frank.
You're not getting any younger.

168
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:25,601
But you've got enormous potential,
each in his own way.

169
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:27,478
-True, true.
-Yes.

170
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:30,814
And I'd love to take you both
under my wing.

171
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,443
For tryouts?

172
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:40,783
But I've got too many prospects,
and I can only manage one of you.

173
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,244
What about the other?

174
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:48,499
The other? Hard to say. Soccer is fickle.

175
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:51,293
Could be a week, a month, a year,

176
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:52,711
or perhaps I'll never pass this way again.

177
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:55,255
How do you propose we decide?

178
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:56,632
Penalty shot.

179
00:11:57,175 --> 00:12:00,969
You're sure? High stakes, Rudo.

180
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,764
Well, that's soccer, right?

181
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:05,724
Absolutely.

182
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:07,518
Choose your goal.

183
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:09,645
That one.

184
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,438
Tally ho, lads.

185
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,649
Penalty shot, bro.

186
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,738
Shoot to the right.

187
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:22,157
-Let me block it. Shoot to the right.
-Okay.

188
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:28,038
Whenever you're ready.

189
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:29,998
Kick it, bro!

190
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:34,211
Come on, shoot!

191
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:39,967
Good show. Congratulations.

192
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,469
-Can we do it over?
-It looked legit to me.

193
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:43,679
Two out of three?

194
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:48,934
Afraid not. That's the game, win some,
lose some. Better luck next time.

195
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:52,729
Well done, Tato. Lovely, right in the pocket.

196
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:57,317
We're off early tomorrow.
Meet me at the tire repair shop at 7:30.

197
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:58,569
I'll be there.

198
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:03,866
Coming! I'm already mobile.
Don't be late. Ciao, champ.

199
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:08,829
-So, where can I stay?
-Mango Bay is 10 miles ahead.

200
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:11,290
Sounds charming for Osiris and myself.
Cheerio, Tato.

201
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:12,791
Should I bring my uniform?

202
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:15,919
-What the fuck?
-What do you mean?

203
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:19,173
I said aim right!
Why'd you shoot the other way?

204
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,049
I aimed right!

205
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:23,802
I meant the other right!

206
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:25,304
What other right?

207
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:27,097
My right, asshole!

208
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:30,309
You should have said to aim that way!

209
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:34,313
-What other right is there, jackass?
-My right, bro! Over there!

210
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:37,149
Motherfucker! Don't play dumb!

211
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:40,527
I'm not playing! You told me, "Aim right"!

212
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:42,529
Weren't you going up North?

213
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:44,323
-Well, yeah, bro!
-So?

214
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:46,408
So, then this chance came along!

215
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:47,576
Traitor!

216
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:53,332
You screwed me out of my chance, asshole!

217
00:13:56,836 --> 00:14:00,839
They say the first wars
were between brothers.

218
00:14:00,924 --> 00:14:05,302
Then came games to prevent them
through symbolic imitation.

219
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:11,642
Pity, nowadays wars are mistaken
for games and games for wars.

220
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:14,478
Especially between brothers.

221
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:15,896
We all depend on you.

222
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:19,942
It's what I always wanted, Toña!
And that asshole fucked it up!

223
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:24,780
But you're foreman at a banana ranch, Beto.
Not a soccer player.

224
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,782
Because I never got the chance!

225
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:34,248
This soccer business is a long shot.
You lose, we all lose big time.

226
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:38,126
That asshole already made me lose!

227
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:42,756
Come on, sweetie.

228
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:49,888
We're better off
without that retarded brother of yours.

229
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:51,306
Don't call him that!

230
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,280
Watch yourself, Mom.

231
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:07,864
What do you mean?

232
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:11,660
-Well, Arnulfo.
-Don't worry. I'll be all right.

233
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:14,830
Well, I'm off.

234
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:17,874
Wish me luck.

235
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:26,008
Take care, Son.
You'll send us something back, right?

236
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:29,928
Of course I will. I'll build you a mansion
with all the money I make.

237
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:34,725
You'll do well, Tato. You'll see.

238
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:36,518
-Bye, Mom.
-Goodbye.

239
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:39,104
-I'll call you.
-Okay.

240
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,671
They stood you up, dumbass!

241
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:46,922
Faggot!

242
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:04,022
Son of a bitch.

243
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:05,691
I was just about to leave, Mr. Baton.

244
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:07,109
Flying the coop?

245
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:10,112
Hop in. Back seat's fit for a king.

246
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:11,279
Here?

247
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:16,535
Have a beer. Don't spill it.
The upholstery is genuine leather.

248
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:17,786
Excuse me, miss.

249
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:26,503
Sorry I'm late, Osiris abused me
all night long and I had to recover.

250
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:27,921
It's cool.

251
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:32,384
-Now who's left behind, faggot!
-Up yours!

252
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:36,471
-Screw you! Kiss my ass!
-What? I can't hear you!

253
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:42,144
I'll offer you a five-year contract.

254
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:45,063
That includes negotiations, administration,

255
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:47,899
everything to make your life easier.

256
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:51,069
My cut is 15%.

257
00:17:51,154 --> 00:17:52,446
Deal?

258
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:57,075
First time in Mexico City?

259
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,160
Yeah.

260
00:17:58,244 --> 00:17:59,870
It's a monster, eh?

261
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:04,666
But even the scariest
monster has its charms.

262
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:09,087
This humble abode is mine.
You'll stay here for a while.

263
00:18:09,172 --> 00:18:11,339
Here's enough food for a week.

264
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:13,842
I'm gonna eat this all week?

265
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,761
They're tasty. They've got shrimp.

266
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:18,764
Nobody's home now,
but three other blokes live here.

267
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:20,182
Not for long, though.

268
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:24,144
But there's only two beds.

269
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:26,271
You'll work out something.

270
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:28,815
Know how to use one of these?

271
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:32,152
-Yeah.
-My number's there if you need anything.

272
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:35,155
-Okay.
-I'll take you to the team tomorrow.

273
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:38,450
Do you know anybody in the music biz?

274
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,744
You're serious about singing, mate?

275
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,287
-Yes.
-What inspired you?

276
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:44,331
-My dad.
-I see...

277
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:46,666
He sang in a famous band.

278
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:48,293
He was French.

279
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:51,546
He left me this.

280
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:54,633
The key of G. Nice.

281
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:57,093
My mother left me this.

282
00:18:57,178 --> 00:18:58,261
Nice.

283
00:18:58,346 --> 00:19:00,472
She was a whore.

284
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:01,640
Great lady.

285
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:03,350
I never wanted for anything.

286
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:09,940
Let's focus only on soccer.

287
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:11,024
Yes.

288
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:12,818
Get some rest,

289
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:15,237
tomorrow's the biggest day of your life.

290
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:17,948
Take care.

291
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:19,032
Thanks.

292
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:21,243
See you later.

293
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:39,928
I'm in for 25

294
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,388
and Pimienta's fucking watch.

295
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,266
You're out of control tonight, Rudo.

296
00:19:44,976 --> 00:19:46,601
He misses his baby brother Tato.

297
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:49,729
I miss the blowjobs your mama
used to give me, asshole.

298
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:53,483
-To be honest, me, too.
-She was good going down, huh?

299
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:57,279
-So what's up? Anybody in?
-I'm out.

300
00:19:57,363 --> 00:20:00,740
50 says I call. Show me what you got.

301
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:02,701
Read them and weep, jacks and aces.

302
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:04,619
Three of a kind, asshole.

303
00:20:06,581 --> 00:20:09,124
Double or nothing. You and me.

304
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,167
What are you gonna bet, your mom?

305
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:13,044
You got another blender?

306
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:16,172
No, but I've got a pan to fry your balls on!

307
00:20:17,008 --> 00:20:18,758
Leave my mom out of this, asshole.

308
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:20,510
Come on, Rudo, take it easy.

309
00:20:23,014 --> 00:20:25,223
All of life is a gamble,

310
00:20:25,308 --> 00:20:28,685
a ball hits the goalpost,
or goes in for a goal.

311
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:32,355
What makes the difference?
Destiny, of course.

312
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,650
And the effect given to the ball
when it's kicked.

313
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:43,700
No!

314
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:46,411
He's a double threat. Old and rotten.

315
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,538
-I'm taking him out. Raúl!
-No, wait!

316
00:20:48,623 --> 00:20:50,582
He's not warmed up yet.
Give him another chance.

317
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:54,085
Don't forget, talent is ageless.

318
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:55,879
He fucks up again, he's out.

319
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:58,340
Give us a moment. Tato! Come!

320
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,597
What's wrong, mate?
Leave your talent back home?

321
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:08,016
That's Yank Garcia!

322
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,769
And J.J. Escandon, and that's Generalisimo.

323
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:12,479
It's just too much.

324
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:15,357
They can all blow me!

325
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:18,944
Yank used to drive a bus!

326
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:23,281
Escandon was a bricklayer!
Generalisimo washed cars!

327
00:21:23,366 --> 00:21:29,204
You're a top player!
Show them what you've got!

328
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,206
Let's make a deal.

329
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:36,711
If you make the team,
I'll help your singing career.

330
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:38,088
Okay.

331
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:43,093
Stop prancing around and play, you wanker!

332
00:21:43,177 --> 00:21:45,303
Won't be long now before the magic starts.

333
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,308
Goal!

334
00:21:50,393 --> 00:21:52,477
What did I tell you?

335
00:21:52,687 --> 00:21:54,229
Where shall we have lunch, darling?

336
00:21:54,689 --> 00:21:55,730
Goal!

337
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:59,943
-The lad's a goal-making machine.
-String, kite, string!

338
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:01,027
Goal.

339
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,196
This could go on all day.

340
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,115
Does he have to do that
every time he scores?

341
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:07,033
The lad's got style.

342
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:09,035
Where'd you find him?

343
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,747
You can talk about the miracle,
but never reveal its source.

344
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:14,457
You prick.

345
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,626
The hick's got something.

346
00:22:16,711 --> 00:22:18,837
Reminds me of myself. I'll take him.

347
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:20,171
He'll be a starter!

348
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:23,508
Depends on him. He's going places.
You go hassle management.

349
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:26,052
Don't forget, I get my 10%.

350
00:22:26,137 --> 00:22:28,596
Done. Always a pleasure, Bruno.

351
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:33,268
I'm waiting for you to come back
into my arms

352
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:38,940
To give me kisses and caresses

353
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:44,154
Tato, pass me the soap. It fell over there.

354
00:22:44,572 --> 00:22:46,364
Where? Oh, yeah.

355
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:48,658
What the fuck!

356
00:22:48,743 --> 00:22:53,204
Players can be quite
imaginative when hazing.

357
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:56,666
Sometimes they switch
toothpaste for shaving cream.

358
00:22:56,751 --> 00:23:00,712
They perform the legendary wedgie,
or the fearsome tube.

359
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:04,549
Some rookies stay awake on
the road so they won't end up

360
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:08,386
with a teammate's penis in their mouths.

361
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:14,642
Faster, man!

362
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:17,771
What's it gonna take?
Chili peppers up your ass?

363
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:21,483
But you said the fruit would bruise.

364
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:24,736
Not if you run with the right technique!

365
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:27,822
What're you looking at, asshole?

366
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,828
What?

367
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:36,331
All you loaders are a bunch of faggots!

368
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:45,131
Give it a rest, dickwad!

369
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,884
Shut up, you fucking hick!

370
00:23:49,887 --> 00:23:52,514
Hit the showers, your feet stink!

371
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:54,265
Shit yeah, man.

372
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:00,480
All right!

373
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:01,731
That's enough for today!

374
00:24:01,816 --> 00:24:03,858
Tato! Come here!

375
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:05,527
How many weeks you been here?

376
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:08,446
About six.

377
00:24:08,531 --> 00:24:09,864
Go get your stuff.

378
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,617
But... How come?

379
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:15,703
You're suiting up for Sunday's game.

380
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,081
You know what that means?

381
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:22,127
I don't know if you'll play,
but you're on the bench.

382
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:24,629
Cat got your tongue?

383
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:28,466
-Thanks, Coach.
-All right, hit the showers.

384
00:24:33,556 --> 00:24:35,348
Are you going to watch Tato's game?

385
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:36,516
I'm busy.

386
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,309
You never miss a game.

387
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,646
Forget about your retarded brother.

388
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,314
I said, don't call him that!

389
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:44,732
Okay.

390
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:46,401
We'll be right outside.

391
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:47,735
Yeah.

392
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,612
You're coming, right?

393
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:55,577
...and here's the bench for Amaranto.

394
00:24:55,661 --> 00:24:59,164
Number 20, Pegoraro.
Number 19, Gabriel Borón.

395
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:01,249
Beto, give me a hand.

396
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,627
-Number 17, Javier Mena.
-Son, come on over here.

397
00:25:04,712 --> 00:25:06,462
Number 14, Tato Verdusco.

398
00:25:06,547 --> 00:25:08,590
There he is!

399
00:25:10,885 --> 00:25:12,886
Toña, you take her.

400
00:25:14,388 --> 00:25:15,680
I got stuff to do.

401
00:25:17,975 --> 00:25:19,726
The bench is purgatory.

402
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:23,688
It's like quicksand, the longer you stay,

403
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:25,148
the deeper you sink.

404
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:27,942
It's like taking your bride on a honeymoon,

405
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:30,320
then not being able to make love,

406
00:25:30,404 --> 00:25:36,451
but having to watch 22 cretins and
three bobbies have their way with her

407
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,786
while thousands cheer.

408
00:25:44,835 --> 00:25:46,044
Raul Perez.

409
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:49,464
Beto Verdusco.

410
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:53,718
You still owe me half of
the next two paychecks, Rudo.

411
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:55,136
So I see.

412
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,430
Rudo! Main office! Phone call!

413
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:58,806
Thanks.

414
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:02,602
You're not supposed to take calls here.
Let this be the last time.

415
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:04,604
Sorry. It won't happen again.

416
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:07,523
Afternoon, boss.

417
00:26:07,608 --> 00:26:08,691
Hello, Rudo.

418
00:26:08,776 --> 00:26:10,485
Sorry, excuse me.

419
00:26:12,488 --> 00:26:13,488
Hello?

420
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:16,407
Rudo! Baton here!

421
00:26:16,492 --> 00:26:18,534
Hello.

422
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:22,247
You want to turn pro?

423
00:26:22,373 --> 00:26:23,873
Yeah, sure.

424
00:26:23,958 --> 00:26:27,502
Your brother's been pushing for this,
really breaking my balls.

425
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:30,755
-He has?
-I won't have any left if he continues.

426
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,799
Whoa, better watch out, Baton.

427
00:26:32,883 --> 00:26:35,176
Soccer in this country
never ceases to amaze,

428
00:26:35,886 --> 00:26:40,181
Second Division extended its
registration deadline.

429
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:42,725
And the Nopaleros club needs a goalkeeper.

430
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:45,812
You've got to be here tomorrow.
Can you make it?

431
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:47,146
Yeah, sure.

432
00:26:47,273 --> 00:26:49,357
Perfect. See you then.

433
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:50,441
Roger.

434
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:52,944
-Big hug, dearie.
-Big hug, dearie.

435
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:56,948
Where've you been?
I've been waiting like some bloody tart!

436
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,866
I'm here, but they wouldn't let me in.

437
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:01,536
If they ask for me, honey,
you've got to let them through.

438
00:27:02,246 --> 00:27:05,206
How's tricks? I found a team
for your brother like you asked.

439
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:07,959
Yeah? Great. But I'm going back home.

440
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:09,669
I'm tired of warming the bench.

441
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:12,797
Have you gone mental? Be patient.
Rome wasn't built in a day.

442
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:17,468
I want to sing. Hook me up with
those guys in the music biz.

443
00:27:17,553 --> 00:27:19,887
I'll get you the best contract!
The best venues!

444
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:21,931
But first you've got to play.

445
00:27:22,016 --> 00:27:24,767
That's what I want, but they won't put me in.

446
00:27:24,852 --> 00:27:26,602
Bruno's an imbecile.

447
00:27:26,687 --> 00:27:32,442
I'll offer him a bigger cut,
maybe he'll make you a starter.

448
00:27:32,526 --> 00:27:34,652
-Yeah.
-What now?

449
00:27:34,737 --> 00:27:37,905
She's Maya Vega, right?
From the TV game shows?

450
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:40,408
-Want to meet her?
-No...

451
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:42,702
There, now, Baton is here.

452
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:44,078
Maya!

453
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:47,582
Batty! So good to see you.

454
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:52,253
Hey, you got Gringa Roldán's
phone number?

455
00:27:52,338 --> 00:27:54,005
Not with me, I'll give it to you later.

456
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:57,884
Let me introduce an amazing
pro player, Tato Verdusco.

457
00:27:57,968 --> 00:28:00,178
-Hi... Sorry.
-When's the next barbecue?

458
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:03,181
Soon. You're the guest of honor.

459
00:28:03,265 --> 00:28:05,350
I'll light the fire, you bring the meat.

460
00:28:05,434 --> 00:28:09,771
Batty, you're impossible!
Gotta run. Take care.

461
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:26,287
I'm leaving, Son.

462
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:29,957
Take care of Mom. Okay.

463
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:37,590
Now what, Beto?

464
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:40,176
-They're falling asleep, eh?
-Where you going at this hour?

465
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,387
To the packing plant.
Two trucks need loading.

466
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:46,057
-Right now?
-Yeah, someone's got to do it...

467
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:48,768
Bye, mango.

468
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:51,145
Go back to sleep.

469
00:28:58,028 --> 00:28:59,529
-Out of my way...
-Excuse me.

470
00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:05,076
Nothing personal, but goalkeepers
always remind me of ravens,

471
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,287
carrion birds. Bad omens.

472
00:29:08,372 --> 00:29:12,333
They're solitary creatures who watch
the world from a distance.

473
00:29:12,418 --> 00:29:16,671
They're allowed the forbidden,
they use their hands to block goals

474
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:20,091
and rain on everyone's parade.

475
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:21,676
They're catastrophic.

476
00:29:22,678 --> 00:29:26,722
Sorry I'm late,
the labor unions are blocking the streets.

477
00:29:26,807 --> 00:29:28,099
Let's go.

478
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:29,684
Afternoon, miss.

479
00:29:30,394 --> 00:29:32,979
Soccer has to be your main priority.

480
00:29:33,063 --> 00:29:35,773
As goalkeeper, you've twice the liability.

481
00:29:35,858 --> 00:29:38,609
Guarding the net means carrying
the team on your shoulders.

482
00:29:38,694 --> 00:29:39,819
It's always your fault.

483
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:42,071
There's an old saying,

484
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:46,534
if you want to stop being a prat,
stop being a goalie.

485
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:47,952
What's a prat?

486
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:50,037
Tosser, knobhead... Jackass.

487
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:53,833
Are you willing to be a jackass for soccer?

488
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:55,126
Jackass? Never. No way.

489
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,712
That's the spirit!

490
00:29:58,005 --> 00:30:01,591
By the way,
I take 15% of everything you make.

491
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:02,758
Agreed?

492
00:30:02,843 --> 00:30:06,471
What? 15%? Too high.

493
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:09,056
I'll take 20 if you insist,
but I've got to charge something.

494
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:12,685
-First time in Mexico City for you, too?
-Yeah.

495
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:14,812
It's a monster, eh?

496
00:30:15,606 --> 00:30:18,399
But even the scariest
monster has its charms.

497
00:30:21,904 --> 00:30:24,071
His name is Beto "Rudo" Verdusco.

498
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:25,781
Your goalie's an old man, Baton.

499
00:30:25,866 --> 00:30:27,366
Talent is ageless, Obdulio.

500
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:28,784
How come they call him "Rudo"?

501
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:31,454
Mafafo!

502
00:30:32,873 --> 00:30:34,207
It was clean.

503
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:39,837
Get out of here! Both of you!
Take five, Mafafo.

504
00:30:39,922 --> 00:30:41,547
He took a dive.

505
00:30:41,715 --> 00:30:43,758
How come that ball's not moving, damn it!

506
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:45,384
So what do I do now?

507
00:30:45,636 --> 00:30:48,221
-Play and keep from getting buggered!
-Keep from what?

508
00:30:50,474 --> 00:30:52,683
So what do you think of Rudo?

509
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:54,477
If I ever need a hitman, I'll call you.

510
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:56,187
The nickname suits him, eh?

511
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:59,607
Too well. Come on!
Stop hogging the ball! Pass!

512
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:02,693
Remember you lost
your goalkeeper for the season.

513
00:31:02,778 --> 00:31:04,695
So what? Yours is a criminal.

514
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:09,408
Don't let him get away.
Your sub is fragile as a teacup,

515
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:11,911
and the other one's got butterfingers.

516
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:15,873
There are others. Go after it!
Don't just stand there!

517
00:31:15,958 --> 00:31:21,212
Incredible! You're passing on
a great goalie and your cut?

518
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:23,172
-What cut?
-10%.

519
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:24,632
Nope.

520
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,384
All right, 15.

521
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:29,470
Okay. He can stay.
Square it with management.

522
00:31:29,555 --> 00:31:31,806
-My cut comes straight from you.
-Done. Always a pleasure, Obdulio.

523
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,474
The pleasure's all yours.

524
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:37,144
Yo, pass me the soap.

525
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:40,815
The pink one? Sure.

526
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,817
Hold up, you faggot!

527
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,235
Calm down, asshole.

528
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:50,157
Come and make me, pussy!

529
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:52,493
Fricking newbie, now you're screwed.
Shaving cream and razors!

530
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:55,746
Let's shave his balls!

531
00:31:55,831 --> 00:32:01,210
Razorblade, razorblade!

532
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:04,839
I'd forgotten that variation.

533
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:07,341
No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

534
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:09,969
Itchy?

535
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:11,887
Try talcum powder.

536
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:14,348
On the bright side, now it'll look bigger.

537
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,268
Sons of bitches. Ganged up on me.

538
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:19,937
One on one,
I would have cracked their fucking skulls.

539
00:32:20,022 --> 00:32:24,317
Let it go.
You don't want enemies right away.

540
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:30,823
The owners pay by the game.
You need to be star goalkeeper.

541
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:34,035
Don't worry. That net is mine.

542
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:35,870
That's the spirit. Keep it up.

543
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:37,371
This way.

544
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:41,876
You're lucky. The other blokes cleared out.

545
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,711
Now it's just you and your brother.

546
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:52,136
Spectacular, eh?

547
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,304
Yeah.

548
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:57,725
Here's food for a week.
They've got shrimp. Quite tasty.

549
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,477
Shrimp? Inside?

550
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,563
That's the place.

551
00:33:03,065 --> 00:33:04,440
Your key.

552
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:07,860
See you tomorrow.
Please don't kill anybody.

553
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:09,820
-You're leaving?
-Quite.

554
00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:14,116
Big hug, dearie!

555
00:33:14,201 --> 00:33:17,244
Little girl, little girl...

556
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:22,166
Yo.

557
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,250
Yo.

558
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,504
-What's up?
-What's up?

559
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,715
How's your team?

560
00:33:30,092 --> 00:33:32,885
Good. We're gonna kick ass.

561
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:36,847
Watch your ass in the showers.
That hazing shit...

562
00:33:36,932 --> 00:33:38,849
They can kiss my ass.

563
00:33:39,309 --> 00:33:40,685
You still on the bench?

564
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:42,728
Yeah. But I don't give a shit.

565
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:45,606
I'm working on my singing career.

566
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:47,942
How do I call home on this piece of crap?

567
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:50,820
I was worried! Nobody knew anything!

568
00:33:50,904 --> 00:33:53,989
How could you leave like that?
Why'd you steal our money?

569
00:33:54,074 --> 00:33:57,827
I didn't steal it, mango.
Just borrowed it. You'll get it back.

570
00:33:57,911 --> 00:33:59,370
Oh, yeah? How?

571
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:02,123
-I'm already on a team.
-So what?

572
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:06,335
You take the blender,
you take our savings, you never change!

573
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:10,005
Sorry, mango,
but now we're gonna live like kings!

574
00:34:10,132 --> 00:34:11,465
When's that gonna happen?

575
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:14,635
Soon as I get paid so you can
come join me here.

576
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,012
And until then? What'll we live on?

577
00:34:17,097 --> 00:34:19,473
-You left us nothing!
-I'll send money!

578
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:22,560
-Or sell Campitos' game!
-You better believe I'm selling it.

579
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:25,396
Sell it, then you'll know
it was good for something.

580
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,232
But I'm not coming out there
or staying here with your mom.

581
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:29,734
-I'm not crazy!
-So what are you gonna do?

582
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:32,153
Like you give a shit! Goodbye!

583
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:43,748
What's Toña up to?

584
00:34:43,832 --> 00:34:46,000
Nothing much. She says hi.

585
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:49,128
-You're pussy-whipped.
-You're a faggot.

586
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:51,255
Want me to make you some soup?

587
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:53,174
Sure. That's talcum, right?

588
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:55,050
It's for your feet.

589
00:34:57,262 --> 00:35:00,347
Look, just pour in boiling water

590
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:03,100
and throw it in.

591
00:35:03,185 --> 00:35:06,145
-Hey, it's got shrimp!
-Yeah, they're freeze-dried.

592
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:09,273
Reunions are always magical,

593
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:12,359
like a striker's goal after a bad run,

594
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:15,488
or kicking the ball after a prolonged injury,

595
00:35:15,572 --> 00:35:19,617
or a fan's return to the stadium
after years of absence.

596
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:28,000
Go get it! Wake up!

597
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:29,376
Stay in formation!

598
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:31,337
Watch your back!

599
00:35:32,005 --> 00:35:33,047
Move out!

600
00:35:33,423 --> 00:35:34,423
Hey, Coach.

601
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:37,968
What's up, Rudo?

602
00:35:38,053 --> 00:35:41,305
The wingmen won't fall back.
They're getting behind us.

603
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:48,312
Why not switch to 4-4-2, move Fede
to defense and play Mafafo as floater?

604
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:51,982
Sure. Don't be such a fucking idiot.

605
00:35:53,944 --> 00:35:56,821
Listen up, men! The ship is sinking!

606
00:35:56,905 --> 00:36:00,074
Switch to 4-4-2! Fede, you're defense!

607
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,575
Mafafo, you play floater!

608
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:04,203
Félix! You're in for Rudo!

609
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,997
Let's win this, men!

610
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:13,337
How'd you like my changes? Good, huh?

611
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:16,048
Go out and win, boys!

612
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:19,635
"How'd you like my changes?"
Son of a bitch!

613
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:22,972
Ever been here before, mate?

614
00:36:23,056 --> 00:36:25,307
I'm a regular.

615
00:36:25,392 --> 00:36:27,685
Hey, Memo? What's up?

616
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:33,858
Come in.

617
00:36:35,777 --> 00:36:37,695
We'll lose our shirts, eh?

618
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:40,030
It's cool, you're with me.

619
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:47,037
Why drag me along?

620
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,415
I'm a pacifist.

621
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:51,834
Let's watch your brother's game instead.

622
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:54,044
Why bother? He never plays!

623
00:36:54,129 --> 00:36:56,171
This isn't what you promised!

624
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:58,674
I didn't even play three games!

625
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:00,551
I'm not even on the bench!

626
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:01,969
That's soccer, Rudo.

627
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:04,388
But I don't make money unless I play.

628
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:08,058
I'm broke. Loan me 100 pesos, okay?

629
00:37:08,727 --> 00:37:10,769
-Fine, but I want it back, eh?
-Yeah.

630
00:37:11,813 --> 00:37:14,315
Bugger me! They're sending him in!
Tato's going in!

631
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:17,985
He may be a rookie,
but he's seen better days.

632
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:19,403
I'll put 100 on the white.

633
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:21,906
There's no white. Red or green.

634
00:37:22,032 --> 00:37:23,949
Red, then. I don't give a shit.

635
00:37:24,034 --> 00:37:25,326
100 on the red he doesn't give a shit about.

636
00:37:25,452 --> 00:37:28,162
-That's it?
-Yeah, well, I'm broke, man.

637
00:37:28,705 --> 00:37:30,789
No more bets! Let them loose!

638
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:34,793
You know why you're broke?
Because you don't play.

639
00:37:34,878 --> 00:37:37,922
If you want to play and get paid,
you have to apologize to Obdulio.

640
00:37:38,006 --> 00:37:39,798
Why? I didn't do anything!

641
00:37:39,925 --> 00:37:43,177
You told the coach how to do his job,
you fool!

642
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:45,054
And the bastard listened!

643
00:37:45,138 --> 00:37:47,973
So what! It's not done.
Not with a ball breaker like Obdulio.

644
00:37:48,058 --> 00:37:50,559
You apologize, you play. End of story.

645
00:37:50,644 --> 00:37:51,769
That asshole can go to hell!

646
00:37:51,853 --> 00:37:54,647
To hell with him, then. You know best.

647
00:37:54,731 --> 00:37:58,192
That's my boy!
See what's left of your chicken, Baton.

648
00:37:58,568 --> 00:38:00,277
What a waste.

649
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,321
That's my cock!

650
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:05,324
Check this out.

651
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:07,534
-Looks pretty bad.
-Yeah.

652
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,413
-So you gonna pay me or what?
-You win, Rudo.

653
00:38:12,165 --> 00:38:13,707
Tato looks good, he fakes,

654
00:38:13,917 --> 00:38:16,377
the goalie leaves his area.

655
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:18,003
Tato shoots.

656
00:38:18,088 --> 00:38:20,214
Goal!

657
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:21,465
What control!

658
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:23,384
What flourish!

659
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:26,553
This rookie is a sweetheart, he's a romantic!

660
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:29,181
Beyond romantic, he's Cursi!

661
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:33,227
What a super-duper goal
by Tato "Cursi" Verdusco!

662
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:37,940
Who said they could call me Cursi?
"We All Wanna Be Cursi."

663
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:41,443
"A Cursi Season." I'm no pansy.

664
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:45,948
They adore you. You've had a dream season.

665
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:50,035
Top scorer, rookie of the year.

666
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,453
But they can't call me that!

667
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:53,914
Bollocks! You'll take
the nickname and like it.

668
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:59,920
Bullshit! You got a good nickname,
a conductor in the mid-field!

669
00:39:00,005 --> 00:39:03,257
Chill out, Cursi.

670
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,050
Don't call me that, asshole!

671
00:39:05,135 --> 00:39:06,927
You are a sweet romantic, Cursi.

672
00:39:07,012 --> 00:39:11,140
How could I explain that I only played
soccer as a lad in the streets,

673
00:39:11,224 --> 00:39:14,268
that I was awful,
and I got the nickname because

674
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:18,022
people said that I'd be better off
conducting an orchestra?

675
00:39:18,106 --> 00:39:20,357
I've good news and bad news, Rudo.

676
00:39:20,442 --> 00:39:22,860
Bad news first.

677
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:25,571
I couldn't find another team for next season.

678
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:29,700
Shit! What's the good news?

679
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:31,410
Look over there.

680
00:39:32,996 --> 00:39:34,038
"Home of Cursi"

681
00:39:34,122 --> 00:39:36,290
-What's that?
-Don't be a fool, Cursi.

682
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,625
The owners want to take care of you.
I present your new home.

683
00:39:38,835 --> 00:39:39,877
Mine? For real?

684
00:39:39,961 --> 00:39:43,756
The rent comes out of your paycheck,
but the furniture is a gift from the Club.

685
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:51,972
Fuck, Baton! What's the good news?

686
00:39:52,182 --> 00:39:53,849
Stop breaking my balls.

687
00:39:53,975 --> 00:39:56,060
Good news is your brother's humble abode.
Smashing, eh?

688
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:57,853
It's huge.
I'm gonna bring all the chicks here.

689
00:39:57,937 --> 00:40:00,439
-The TV's incredible.
-Go look around.

690
00:40:03,693 --> 00:40:07,362
Whoa! Beto, three rooms!

691
00:40:07,447 --> 00:40:10,282
A bathroom with one of those tubs
that make bubbles.

692
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:14,495
There's room for you, Beto.

693
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:16,080
Baton!

694
00:40:16,456 --> 00:40:18,832
The SUV is also a gift from the Club.

695
00:40:20,293 --> 00:40:21,585
Seriously?

696
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:25,172
It's white, like a ghost!

697
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:29,343
What are you doing? Chin up, come here.

698
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:30,469
I'm fine.

699
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:32,930
You're not, because you haven't
heard the good news.

700
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:35,349
Nopaleros are now First Division.

701
00:40:37,477 --> 00:40:39,770
But we didn't make the playoffs.
Panteras were the champs.

702
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:44,358
The magic of soccer in Mexico.
The owners paid for a new franchise!

703
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:45,943
Boggles the mind.

704
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:48,153
What about that asshole Obdulio?

705
00:40:48,238 --> 00:40:51,824
He's out! The new coach is a friend of mine!

706
00:40:52,075 --> 00:40:54,493
I raved about you
and you're his starting goalie!

707
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:55,953
Marvelous, eh?

708
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:57,871
I'm the starter? For real?

709
00:40:58,039 --> 00:41:01,125
-Of course, as it you should be.
-Tato, turn that off!

710
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:02,626
I can't turn it off.

711
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:05,212
Bollocks, like this!

712
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:07,965
One more thing...

713
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:14,930
A contract to record a song and a video.

714
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:16,557
Spare me.

715
00:41:17,267 --> 00:41:19,518
We're gonna make it big!

716
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:48,338
I want you to want me

717
00:41:49,883 --> 00:41:53,427
I need you to need me

718
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:58,182
I'd love you to love me

719
00:41:59,267 --> 00:42:03,061
I'm begging you to beg me

720
00:42:04,105 --> 00:42:06,315
I'll shine up the old brown boots

721
00:42:06,399 --> 00:42:09,026
I'll put on a brand new hat

722
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:10,777
I'll get home early from work

723
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:15,115
If you say that you love me

724
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:19,953
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you crying?

725
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:24,666
Oh, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you crying?

726
00:42:25,585 --> 00:42:28,837
Feeling all alone without you
I feel like dying

727
00:42:37,764 --> 00:42:39,514
String, kite, string!

728
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:40,891
Let's get going, bro.

729
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:42,226
Hold on, wait up.

730
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:44,811
Give me a break.
You've been watching that for weeks.

731
00:42:44,896 --> 00:42:46,563
Awesome, huh?

732
00:42:46,648 --> 00:42:49,149
It's all right. But enough already.

733
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,652
Okay, let's go.

734
00:42:51,778 --> 00:42:53,654
The painting my dad left me
looks good, huh?

735
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:59,743
Really lights up the room.

736
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:01,119
Yeah.

737
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:02,871
Right on.

738
00:43:02,956 --> 00:43:05,165
Hell yes. It's awesome.

739
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,251
Aren't you Rudo and Cursi?

740
00:43:07,335 --> 00:43:08,335
Yeah.

741
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:10,128
I swear you're the sweetest striker ever.

742
00:43:10,213 --> 00:43:11,546
Thanks, man.

743
00:43:11,631 --> 00:43:16,426
You're a wall, Rudo.
Without you Nopaleros would get creamed.

744
00:43:16,511 --> 00:43:18,303
They should worship you.

745
00:43:18,388 --> 00:43:20,514
-Can I give you two a kiss?
-Sure.

746
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:23,517
Can we get a picture with you?

747
00:43:27,355 --> 00:43:29,356
Go, go!

748
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:46,581
Why don't you sit with me,
have a drink and watch the race?

749
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:50,294
I can't. I'm working.

750
00:43:50,378 --> 00:43:53,046
They won't let you? Bastards.

751
00:43:53,548 --> 00:43:57,634
Give me your number
and we'll toast when your shift ends.

752
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:03,223
Cell phone, I don't want to call your mom.

753
00:44:04,434 --> 00:44:06,018
You're Cursi, right?

754
00:44:09,397 --> 00:44:10,897
You're Maya Vega.

755
00:44:11,232 --> 00:44:12,607
Have we met?

756
00:44:12,692 --> 00:44:15,652
Sure, I'd know you anywhere.

757
00:44:15,737 --> 00:44:20,741
I love your nickname, "Cursi."
You must be really sweet.

758
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,701
Yeah... You could say that.

759
00:44:23,703 --> 00:44:25,996
A super player who's super romantic.

760
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:30,876
But soccer's not really my thing.
I'm actually a singer...

761
00:44:31,753 --> 00:44:34,796
Look, this was my dad's, he was French.

762
00:44:35,298 --> 00:44:39,134
If you sing like you play,
I want all your records.

763
00:44:40,428 --> 00:44:41,970
Buy me a drink?

764
00:44:42,055 --> 00:44:44,306
Yeah, sure. What'll it be?

765
00:44:44,766 --> 00:44:47,642
Champagne, sweetie. Chilled.

766
00:44:48,269 --> 00:44:50,854
Make it two, please. Thanks.

767
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:58,445
Go! Go!

768
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:08,413
That's that. Thanks. Later.

769
00:45:08,498 --> 00:45:10,290
-You're Rudo, right?
-Yeah.

770
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:14,378
You're a great goalie. Great gambler, too.
You really got a sixth sense.

771
00:45:14,462 --> 00:45:15,587
Really?

772
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:20,634
Sure. Let me offer you my services,
Las Vegas-style entertainment.

773
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:22,636
Top notch.

774
00:45:23,763 --> 00:45:25,472
Give me a ring whenever.

775
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:42,656
-Look at the big truck, Mom!
-About time you came home, boys!

776
00:45:45,368 --> 00:45:48,870
-Look what I brought you.
-How handsome!

777
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:51,331
Hey, Mom.

778
00:45:52,792 --> 00:45:54,167
You're getting big!

779
00:45:54,252 --> 00:45:55,919
When did they build that new road?

780
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:57,587
Some guy named Don Casimiro put it in.

781
00:45:57,672 --> 00:46:00,048
He bought up all the ranches.
They say he's a drug lord.

782
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:01,758
Very cool road.

783
00:46:01,843 --> 00:46:03,593
Check this out.

784
00:46:03,678 --> 00:46:06,596
To watch over you when I'm not around.

785
00:46:06,681 --> 00:46:10,016
It's choreographic. Eyes open and shut.

786
00:46:10,101 --> 00:46:12,811
-It's lovely!
-I'll hang it up.

787
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:15,021
-What happened to you, Mom?
-Nothing, son.

788
00:46:15,106 --> 00:46:16,606
Let me see.

789
00:46:17,567 --> 00:46:19,860
I must have bumped into something.

790
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:22,112
Where's that asshole Arnulfo?

791
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:24,823
He ran off with some bimbo. Don't worry.

792
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:26,825
-How am I not going to worry?
-Hello, Baton?

793
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:28,410
I'll kill that motherfucker!

794
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:30,787
That pig will end up worse than your dad.

795
00:46:31,998 --> 00:46:33,457
How come you didn't tell me, Nadia?

796
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:37,127
-I couldn't.
-You couldn't? One phone call!

797
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:40,881
Tato, look what that prick Arnulfo did!

798
00:46:43,176 --> 00:46:45,343
Son of a bitch!

799
00:46:45,428 --> 00:46:47,262
No, not you, Baton.

800
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:49,764
One fucking phone call, Nadia!

801
00:46:51,893 --> 00:46:53,518
I'll call you back.

802
00:46:53,978 --> 00:46:55,353
Hey, Mom, guess what?

803
00:46:55,438 --> 00:46:56,646
They picked me!

804
00:46:56,731 --> 00:46:59,232
-For what?
-The national team! What else?

805
00:46:59,734 --> 00:47:01,067
We're going to play Haiti!

806
00:47:01,694 --> 00:47:02,777
What about you, loser?

807
00:47:04,405 --> 00:47:07,032
Thanks, honey. It's real nice.

808
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:10,577
Sorry I took so long, mango.

809
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:13,246
The blender's just the start.

810
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:15,999
I'll get you out of this shithole.

811
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:18,919
My home is not a shithole!
I put it together myself!

812
00:47:19,754 --> 00:47:21,421
It's pretty crappy.

813
00:47:22,298 --> 00:47:23,507
Just wait until I'm done.

814
00:47:23,591 --> 00:47:26,384
Come with me to the city.
You'll see how nice the house is.

815
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:28,929
I don't know, honey.

816
00:47:29,972 --> 00:47:32,432
You're my wife, aren't you?

817
00:47:32,642 --> 00:47:34,017
I don't know anymore.

818
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:35,977
My husband took off like some crook.

819
00:47:36,312 --> 00:47:38,355
I paid everything back, Toña.

820
00:47:38,439 --> 00:47:41,233
Yeah, but I'm doing fine right here.

821
00:47:41,317 --> 00:47:42,984
I'm a sales rep for WonderLife now.

822
00:47:43,069 --> 00:47:45,320
What the fuck is that?

823
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:49,241
WonderLife is a multi-level marketing
company promoting well-being.

824
00:47:49,909 --> 00:47:54,371
We develop and sell vitamins,
supplements, all that stuff.

825
00:47:54,455 --> 00:47:56,039
That shit doesn't work!

826
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:58,291
It does! I'm doing well.

827
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:00,669
I've almost earned enough for a little car.

828
00:48:01,671 --> 00:48:06,299
Screw that! I'll get you a car or
whatever you want if you come with me!

829
00:48:06,384 --> 00:48:08,385
I've got nothing to do in the city.

830
00:48:08,469 --> 00:48:09,970
Why don't you stay here with us?

831
00:48:10,054 --> 00:48:13,348
You never listen, do you? I'm on a team!
First Division! I can't stay here.

832
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:16,351
Well, I'm happy here
with my home and my customers.

833
00:48:18,563 --> 00:48:21,481
Tristan's not good enough for you.

834
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:26,528
His dad runs that dime store
and barely gets by.

835
00:48:26,612 --> 00:48:27,904
Not again.

836
00:48:27,989 --> 00:48:33,743
He just wants to knock you up.
Like all the other bastards.

837
00:48:33,828 --> 00:48:35,287
That's not true.

838
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:37,789
Open your eyes. Don't be a fool.

839
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:39,541
Leave me alone, Mom.

840
00:48:40,001 --> 00:48:43,169
That girl. She reminds me of her father.

841
00:48:43,421 --> 00:48:46,339
No way. He was ugly.

842
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:48,883
Nadia takes after you. She's pretty.

843
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:51,678
Right, Beto?

844
00:48:53,264 --> 00:48:57,350
Never mind. Beto's upset
because he can't control his wife.

845
00:49:00,229 --> 00:49:01,396
So...

846
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,189
Do you like Chololos Beach?

847
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:09,446
I love it. My dad used to bring me here.

848
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:10,989
We'd get naked and goof around.

849
00:49:11,073 --> 00:49:13,575
Here's where I want to build your new house.

850
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:15,660
For real?

851
00:49:15,745 --> 00:49:19,247
No, I want to build your new house.

852
00:49:19,332 --> 00:49:20,290
You, too?

853
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:22,626
I'm figuring out how to finance it.

854
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:26,796
No, I'm looking at lots
to build your house on.

855
00:49:26,881 --> 00:49:30,008
It'll be nicer than that drug lord's house.

856
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:33,428
Much nicer. Huge. Three floors!

857
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:39,434
I'll put your pool bar over here.

858
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:42,479
No, I'll build your bedroom
with a balcony and a view of the ocean.

859
00:49:42,563 --> 00:49:46,399
The love for a mother
and a uniform are the same.

860
00:49:46,484 --> 00:49:49,235
Mothers provide our identity.

861
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:52,072
Our struggle to win her affection
is our struggle to stay alive.

862
00:49:52,281 --> 00:49:56,159
Every fan wants to prove
that he loves his team colors best,

863
00:49:56,369 --> 00:50:00,664
and every son knows
nobody loves Mom like he does.

864
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:08,088
No, Mayita.

865
00:50:08,172 --> 00:50:10,382
-Not here.
-Yes, Cursi. I can't wait.

866
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:12,801
Wow, Cursi!

867
00:50:23,646 --> 00:50:25,146
Oh, God.

868
00:50:26,774 --> 00:50:28,024
Oh, boy.

869
00:50:28,109 --> 00:50:29,109
What?

870
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:31,778
You're all shaved.

871
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:34,239
-You like?
-Yeah.

872
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:36,616
It's yours.

873
00:50:41,622 --> 00:50:42,747
Mayita.

874
00:50:43,624 --> 00:50:45,125
You're sexier than I thought.

875
00:50:45,626 --> 00:50:47,335
They're all yours.

876
00:50:48,003 --> 00:50:51,256
My buddies are never gonna believe me.

877
00:50:52,925 --> 00:50:59,389
Baby Face says you're a fragrant flower,

878
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:02,058
the sweetest nectar and all that.

879
00:51:02,143 --> 00:51:03,727
The bastard's a real poet.

880
00:51:03,811 --> 00:51:07,355
Ché has all your calendars.

881
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:12,235
Correct me if I'm wrong.
Loving a woman and a ball is the same.

882
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:17,532
You've got to entice her
and guide her with skill,

883
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:22,078
put her in her place if need be,
and never lose control.

884
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:26,499
I know, mango, it is Tato's house,
but just until we find something better.

885
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:29,669
Guess what?

886
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:34,466
I'm selling WonderLife now.

887
00:51:35,134 --> 00:51:37,802
For real! TotalWonder's amazing!

888
00:51:37,887 --> 00:51:39,929
I signed up four teammates.

889
00:51:40,014 --> 00:51:42,348
I told them it takes 400 points.

890
00:51:43,309 --> 00:51:46,436
Five hundred, sorry,

891
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:50,064
to become Quartz Sales Reps.

892
00:51:50,149 --> 00:51:55,278
The whole team is on WonderLife.

893
00:51:58,866 --> 00:52:00,033
One of my clients is waiting, honey.

894
00:52:02,203 --> 00:52:05,538
Like you died and went to heaven, right?

895
00:52:06,415 --> 00:52:07,957
Yeah, just like heaven.

896
00:52:08,042 --> 00:52:10,210
Come to the poker table.

897
00:52:10,878 --> 00:52:13,338
Minimum stake is $10,000.

898
00:52:13,923 --> 00:52:16,382
Did you see the pot he raked in?

899
00:52:16,509 --> 00:52:18,176
Time for bazooka.

900
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:20,720
-A what?
-Your hand. Bazooka.

901
00:52:20,805 --> 00:52:22,138
What's this?

902
00:52:22,223 --> 00:52:23,890
Snow White, blow. Coke.

903
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:26,267
No way, I'm an athlete.

904
00:52:26,352 --> 00:52:30,814
Whatever you say. You decide.
It helps some people play better.

905
00:52:30,898 --> 00:52:32,398
Play what? Poker?

906
00:52:32,483 --> 00:52:34,192
Sure.

907
00:52:34,276 --> 00:52:36,110
Have a seat, please.

908
00:52:36,904 --> 00:52:39,280
-Evening, miss.
-Your chips. Let's play.

909
00:52:41,033 --> 00:52:42,700
This car's a tank, huh?

910
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:47,580
I'm so proud of the way
you've come out on top.

911
00:52:47,665 --> 00:52:48,665
Yeah?

912
00:52:48,749 --> 00:52:51,125
Didn't you notice at the disco last night?

913
00:52:51,210 --> 00:52:52,836
The Dogo?

914
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:55,755
It's super exclusive, all these VIPs
falling over themselves for you.

915
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:57,340
People love you!

916
00:52:57,424 --> 00:52:59,717
That place is super cool. I had a great time.

917
00:52:59,802 --> 00:53:02,470
Me, too. And that suit you had on?

918
00:53:02,555 --> 00:53:04,305
-Yeah, the...
-Dolce & Gabbana.

919
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:07,100
-Gabbana, yeah.
-You looked incredible.

920
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:11,187
Not like your friend Worm-face or, sorry,
your brother, they'd never pull it off!

921
00:53:11,272 --> 00:53:13,398
Well, my brother is sort of a hick.

922
00:53:13,482 --> 00:53:15,733
And how many guys are
top players like you,

923
00:53:15,818 --> 00:53:19,654
or how many singers have
your super style and super voice?

924
00:53:19,864 --> 00:53:21,406
Well, singing is my thing.

925
00:53:21,490 --> 00:53:22,699
I know.

926
00:53:22,783 --> 00:53:24,701
Let me see something.

927
00:53:28,914 --> 00:53:31,666
-Hey, can you climb in there?
-Inside?

928
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:33,626
Yeah. I want to see something.

929
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:44,095
It's not easy to come from nowhere
and make it big, sweetie.

930
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:46,514
-Why?
-Because I know.

931
00:53:46,765 --> 00:53:48,391
I ran away from Puerto Rico.

932
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:52,645
Pop wanted me to work in the bakery,
and Mom wanted me to fry bananas.

933
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:53,897
That's not me!

934
00:53:53,981 --> 00:53:55,607
-No.
-Not really.

935
00:53:55,691 --> 00:53:57,317
You've come out on top, Mayita.

936
00:53:57,401 --> 00:53:59,402
Here I am, on TV, in magazines,

937
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:02,989
and with the most handsome,
talented boyfriend in the world.

938
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:06,159
You like this car?

939
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:10,413
It's the car I've always wanted.
But it's too expensive, sweetie.

940
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:12,165
Well, it's yours.

941
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:15,668
-For real?
-A gift from me, if you want it.

942
00:54:15,753 --> 00:54:17,837
Oh, baby, I love you.

943
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:20,882
Me, too.

944
00:54:22,301 --> 00:54:25,637
Rudo Verdusco, the goalkeeping sensation!

945
00:54:25,721 --> 00:54:30,224
If he keeps it up, he'll break the record
for shut-outs. And how about his brother?

946
00:54:30,309 --> 00:54:31,935
Cursi should be playing like Rudo,

947
00:54:32,019 --> 00:54:34,979
but he fell from the national team
into the love nest,

948
00:54:35,064 --> 00:54:37,774
-posing with his girl in magazines...
-So what? You're jealous!

949
00:54:37,858 --> 00:54:40,193
...living a pipe dream that'll kill his talent!

950
00:54:40,277 --> 00:54:43,112
Get him off, get him off me!

951
00:54:43,197 --> 00:54:46,074
Chill out, bro. Charlie's house-trained.

952
00:54:46,158 --> 00:54:47,784
Why'd you bring it here?

953
00:54:47,868 --> 00:54:50,411
I won him at poker. He's worth a bundle.

954
00:54:50,496 --> 00:54:54,666
Tell him not to shit everywhere,
the place is a pigsty!

955
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:57,627
-Answer the door.
-Coming.

956
00:55:00,005 --> 00:55:01,923
What's up, Son?

957
00:55:02,925 --> 00:55:05,468
How are you?

958
00:55:06,929 --> 00:55:08,137
Come on in.

959
00:55:08,222 --> 00:55:09,889
Campitos! How's it going?

960
00:55:16,689 --> 00:55:18,648
Angelita, what a big girl!

961
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:20,900
She's asleep. My stuff.

962
00:55:20,985 --> 00:55:22,652
I'll get it.

963
00:55:22,736 --> 00:55:24,195
This is Charlie!

964
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:25,780
Oh, how nice!

965
00:55:26,448 --> 00:55:28,282
This house is gorgeous.

966
00:55:28,367 --> 00:55:32,286
What'd I tell you? Look at Campos! Hey!

967
00:55:32,371 --> 00:55:33,830
What made you change your mind?

968
00:55:33,914 --> 00:55:39,419
I was sharing at a WonderLife meeting.

969
00:55:39,503 --> 00:55:42,505
I told everyone how
you're selling product and trying so hard,

970
00:55:42,589 --> 00:55:44,716
and I realized it's best if we're all together.

971
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:48,720
I'll break the record with you here.

972
00:55:50,055 --> 00:55:53,766
I want you to want me

973
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:58,521
I need you to need me

974
00:55:59,523 --> 00:56:03,735
I'd love you to love me

975
00:56:03,819 --> 00:56:07,989
I'm begging you to beg me

976
00:56:09,116 --> 00:56:11,284
I'll shine up the old brown boots

977
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:13,703
I'll put on a brand new hat

978
00:56:13,787 --> 00:56:15,455
I'll get home early from work

979
00:56:15,539 --> 00:56:20,209
If you say that you love me

980
00:56:20,961 --> 00:56:24,422
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you crying?

981
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:35,058
Since you didn't get a band,
I was tripping over my own voice!

982
00:56:35,142 --> 00:56:39,353
Okay, it was a dive,
but playback concerts are normal.

983
00:56:39,688 --> 00:56:42,565
What the fuck's normal about this?

984
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:44,442
Singing at a circus for a bunch of brats?

985
00:56:44,526 --> 00:56:48,696
A circus matinee
was the only gig they could get!

986
00:56:48,781 --> 00:56:52,408
Fucking useless record label,
they don't care about me!

987
00:56:52,493 --> 00:56:54,994
I'm hot shit!

988
00:56:55,079 --> 00:56:57,747
On the pitch you are!

989
00:56:57,831 --> 00:56:59,457
Soccer's your bag, not music!

990
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:01,876
Batty's got a point.

991
00:57:02,544 --> 00:57:04,796
What? You're on his side now?

992
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:09,759
No, sweetie, you sing nice,
but your goals are beautiful.

993
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:13,179
Life would be easier
if you could distinguish at birth

994
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:16,224
between passion and talent.

995
00:57:16,308 --> 00:57:20,269
That's the difference between
a hooligan and top player,

996
00:57:20,354 --> 00:57:22,647
between adoring and being adored.

997
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:25,149
Two pairs, tens and fives.

998
00:57:25,234 --> 00:57:28,069
Same here. What else you got?

999
00:57:28,153 --> 00:57:29,779
-A three.
-A seven.

1000
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:31,948
You're full of shit!

1001
00:57:32,032 --> 00:57:34,784
You got to know how to play the game!

1002
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:36,994
Way to stay cool.

1003
00:57:37,079 --> 00:57:38,913
Great hand.

1004
00:57:38,997 --> 00:57:41,374
Want to pay off that credit line we gave you?

1005
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:43,960
If I don't use it now,
when I'm on a roll, I'm fucked.

1006
00:57:44,044 --> 00:57:46,504
-Whatever you say.
-This is all I got.

1007
00:57:46,588 --> 00:57:48,089
Give me a little fix, no?

1008
00:57:48,173 --> 00:57:49,257
Sure.

1009
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:54,262
-All bets.
-Yeah, I'm flying blind.

1010
00:57:54,346 --> 00:57:55,346
Bets.

1011
00:57:56,181 --> 00:57:57,765
-Bets.
-Play!

1012
00:57:57,850 --> 00:57:59,350
Ace of diamonds. Five of hearts.

1013
00:57:59,434 --> 00:58:01,602
-Fifty.
-Queen of diamonds.

1014
00:58:02,396 --> 00:58:05,148
-Hit?
-No, I'm out.

1015
00:58:05,274 --> 00:58:07,900
I can handle 50. Here.

1016
00:58:08,026 --> 00:58:09,902
-Hit?
-We ain't got all night.

1017
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:11,154
I fold.

1018
00:58:11,238 --> 00:58:12,738
-Hit?
-Fold.

1019
00:58:13,407 --> 00:58:15,116
Alone again.

1020
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,325
Ten of hearts.

1021
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:19,120
Well, let's up the ante another 50.

1022
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:21,247
Why not 100?

1023
00:58:23,584 --> 00:58:25,251
Why not?

1024
00:58:27,212 --> 00:58:29,172
Eight of hearts. Anyone want to raise?

1025
00:58:29,256 --> 00:58:30,339
Pass.

1026
00:58:42,144 --> 00:58:43,853
Are you in or not?

1027
00:58:43,937 --> 00:58:46,480
I'm all in. That's all I've got.

1028
00:58:46,565 --> 00:58:48,024
You call?

1029
00:58:48,108 --> 00:58:50,151
-I call.
-Don't be such a wuss!

1030
00:58:50,235 --> 00:58:51,736
Show them.

1031
00:58:53,989 --> 00:58:55,489
Show your cards.

1032
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:57,867
Three of a kind.

1033
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:01,913
Flush. Read them and weep.

1034
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:24,894
You had me sing at a Sweet 16 party, Baton!

1035
00:59:24,978 --> 00:59:27,063
I've had it! So, ciao!

1036
00:59:32,611 --> 00:59:36,072
What the fuck? Where is everything?

1037
00:59:36,156 --> 00:59:39,075
-We got robbed, bro.
-What?

1038
00:59:39,159 --> 00:59:41,118
Yeah. Cleaned out.

1039
00:59:41,203 --> 00:59:43,537
You tell the security guy?
Maybe he saw something.

1040
00:59:44,164 --> 00:59:45,790
He said he didn't.

1041
00:59:45,874 --> 00:59:49,377
Bastard. He's in on it. Let's call the cops.

1042
00:59:49,461 --> 00:59:51,087
No, what for?

1043
00:59:51,171 --> 00:59:53,589
Won't do any good.

1044
00:59:53,674 --> 00:59:57,969
They'll just ask stupid questions.

1045
01:00:00,264 --> 01:00:02,014
Shit, man.

1046
01:00:03,725 --> 01:00:08,062
Look. All they left was your dad's painting.

1047
01:00:08,146 --> 01:00:09,230
Yeah.

1048
01:00:13,527 --> 01:00:15,736
You lost my stuff gambling, didn't you?

1049
01:00:17,489 --> 01:00:20,366
I'm talking to you! You fucked up
and lost my stuff gambling, right?

1050
01:00:22,536 --> 01:00:27,540
I was on a winning streak,
but then my system failed me.

1051
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:29,959
Fuck that! You lost everything?

1052
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:31,544
And I still owe them a shitload.

1053
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:34,338
You asshole! We're supposed to be
saving up to build Mom's house!

1054
01:00:34,423 --> 01:00:38,217
-We still got your savings.
-I've got dick!

1055
01:00:38,302 --> 01:00:41,304
I've got a girl and a shitload of expenses!

1056
01:00:41,388 --> 01:00:44,598
You're a lying pig just like your old man!

1057
01:00:44,683 --> 01:00:46,475
You're just like that
child-molesting motherfucker!

1058
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:48,352
Watch your mouth, shithead!

1059
01:00:48,437 --> 01:00:51,480
He was a son of a bitch just like you!

1060
01:00:51,565 --> 01:00:54,066
I bet he got off on this piece of crap!

1061
01:00:54,151 --> 01:00:56,319
-Quit it, jackass!
-What're you doing, faggot?

1062
01:00:56,403 --> 01:00:59,363
-Your dad was worse, asshole!
-My dad was on the level! He was French!

1063
01:00:59,448 --> 01:01:02,241
They called him Frenchy
because he smelled!

1064
01:01:02,326 --> 01:01:04,744
-Fucking truck driver from Sonora!
-You're jealous, faggot!

1065
01:01:04,828 --> 01:01:06,162
Of what, shithead?

1066
01:01:06,246 --> 01:01:09,790
Of me, because I play better than you
and I got a high-class broad!

1067
01:01:09,875 --> 01:01:14,503
High-class? They call her "pajamas"
because everyone wears her to bed!

1068
01:01:14,588 --> 01:01:16,255
-Shut the fuck up, asshole!
-Make me, faggot!

1069
01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:19,717
Fair play ends where intolerance begins,

1070
01:01:19,801 --> 01:01:23,304
with brothers turning
the game back into a battle.

1071
01:01:23,388 --> 01:01:28,184
When balls are replaced
with severed heads once again,

1072
01:01:28,268 --> 01:01:31,479
to vent pent-up rage and resentment.

1073
01:01:32,147 --> 01:01:33,564
Tragic, really.

1074
01:01:33,648 --> 01:01:36,484
What's wrong with Cursi?
Is he playing dodgeball?

1075
01:01:36,568 --> 01:01:40,279
Who wants him like this? He hasn't been
the same since Haiti, he's been cursed.

1076
01:01:40,364 --> 01:01:41,864
Watch him shoot and miss!

1077
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:44,575
-Bastards!
-One, two, strike three! You're out!

1078
01:01:44,659 --> 01:01:46,452
Cursi needs to get back into shape,
he's partying too much.

1079
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:48,454
Fuck them!

1080
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:50,956
He's a dork, honey.

1081
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:53,709
He dated Brenda, from the nightly news?

1082
01:01:53,794 --> 01:01:55,252
She says he's eensy-weensy.

1083
01:01:55,337 --> 01:01:58,172
Who cares? What's wrong with me?
I'm playing like shit.

1084
01:01:58,256 --> 01:02:00,174
It's just a bad streak.

1085
01:02:00,258 --> 01:02:02,760
When is it gonna end?

1086
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:06,055
There's something I need to tell you.

1087
01:02:06,139 --> 01:02:08,057
I need to tell you something, too.

1088
01:02:08,141 --> 01:02:09,767
Really? What?

1089
01:02:09,851 --> 01:02:11,560
-No, you first.
-No, you.

1090
01:02:11,645 --> 01:02:13,396
-You first, honey.
-You.

1091
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:15,606
-You were gonna tell me first.
-You tell me.

1092
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:17,358
-Hey!
-What?

1093
01:02:19,861 --> 01:02:22,196
Here, take it.

1094
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:26,117
Thanks. You know chocolates
make me break out.

1095
01:02:26,201 --> 01:02:28,661
But these are dietetic. Just open it.

1096
01:02:39,673 --> 01:02:41,674
It's beautiful.

1097
01:02:42,134 --> 01:02:45,594
So? Will you marry me?

1098
01:02:47,806 --> 01:02:50,599
Of course I will, I love you.

1099
01:02:50,684 --> 01:02:52,184
I love you, too.

1100
01:02:52,853 --> 01:02:54,520
What were you gonna tell me?

1101
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:56,772
Nothing, forget about it.

1102
01:03:06,533 --> 01:03:08,993
I'm watching cartoons, Son. Hang on.

1103
01:03:09,077 --> 01:03:12,830
Give her WonderBaby three times a day.

1104
01:03:12,914 --> 01:03:14,457
Okay.

1105
01:03:14,541 --> 01:03:16,459
Charlie, say bye-bye!

1106
01:03:18,211 --> 01:03:21,130
See you later. Take care.

1107
01:03:21,214 --> 01:03:23,507
If you don't like cartoons,
I'll change channels.

1108
01:03:23,592 --> 01:03:26,802
Hotel manager says
we can't keep Charlie here.

1109
01:03:27,471 --> 01:03:30,306
Then we'll find someplace else.

1110
01:03:30,390 --> 01:03:34,018
My sales have taken off
since I started bringing Charlie.

1111
01:03:34,102 --> 01:03:36,437
-We can get a lot of money for him.
-So what?

1112
01:03:36,521 --> 01:03:39,857
-So we have to sell him.
-It's not worth it.

1113
01:03:41,026 --> 01:03:43,319
-Loan me some pocket money?
-What for?

1114
01:03:43,403 --> 01:03:46,238
To get some food. Look at the time.

1115
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:49,575
Okay, but bring some juice for the kids.

1116
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:54,079
Don't be long.

1117
01:03:59,961 --> 01:04:01,295
Hello?

1118
01:04:02,422 --> 01:04:04,507
-Son, how are you?
-Mom, what's going on?

1119
01:04:04,591 --> 01:04:06,217
I got a big surprise!

1120
01:04:06,301 --> 01:04:09,428
Your sister Nadia is getting married!
Can you guess who to?

1121
01:04:09,513 --> 01:04:11,347
To...

1122
01:04:12,182 --> 01:04:13,516
Tristan?

1123
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:16,894
Are you nuts? That deadbeat? No way!

1124
01:04:16,978 --> 01:04:18,562
She's marrying Don Casimiro!

1125
01:04:18,647 --> 01:04:20,314
But the guy's a drug lord!

1126
01:04:20,398 --> 01:04:21,857
Don't call him that.

1127
01:04:21,942 --> 01:04:25,277
His guys were in a shootout
back home, right?

1128
01:04:25,362 --> 01:04:27,363
And those people
they beheaded on the coast, too.

1129
01:04:27,447 --> 01:04:28,739
Gossip.

1130
01:04:28,823 --> 01:04:31,075
He's quality.
He already gave us a pick-up truck.

1131
01:04:32,118 --> 01:04:33,536
So he's all right, then.

1132
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:36,080
The wedding's on a weekday
so you can come.

1133
01:04:36,164 --> 01:04:39,416
Sounds great. See you there.

1134
01:04:41,753 --> 01:04:43,546
Bye, Mom, kisses.

1135
01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:45,297
Bye, Beto.

1136
01:04:46,258 --> 01:04:48,884
Hey, what's up?

1137
01:04:48,969 --> 01:04:52,012
-Want to go shopping?
-Shopping? Sure.

1138
01:04:54,808 --> 01:04:58,352
It's out of my hands.
I'm the front. I just run the show.

1139
01:04:58,436 --> 01:05:00,354
But the folks behind the scenes
want their money.

1140
01:05:00,438 --> 01:05:01,897
Ask them to raise my credit.

1141
01:05:01,982 --> 01:05:04,567
I swear this pains me.
But it ain't gonna happen.

1142
01:05:04,651 --> 01:05:06,318
Your IOU is tsunami size.

1143
01:05:06,403 --> 01:05:08,779
I'll pay back everything. Just give me time.

1144
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:11,448
I'd love to help. But I can't.

1145
01:05:11,533 --> 01:05:13,033
Do you have Pampers Supreme?

1146
01:05:13,118 --> 01:05:15,411
-We're all out, sir.
-Shit.

1147
01:05:15,495 --> 01:05:20,332
You've got no limit, Rudo,
you bet too much, you dig blow.

1148
01:05:20,417 --> 01:05:22,334
I just use it to gamble
because it helps me win.

1149
01:05:22,419 --> 01:05:24,378
I always hear that.

1150
01:05:24,462 --> 01:05:27,339
You got no plan B. And that costs money.

1151
01:05:27,424 --> 01:05:29,592
One more chance.

1152
01:05:31,678 --> 01:05:34,680
You got 15 days to settle the score.
That's super generous.

1153
01:05:35,682 --> 01:05:37,433
Cupcake?

1154
01:05:37,517 --> 01:05:39,727
Listen, they're all out of Pampers Supreme.

1155
01:05:40,687 --> 01:05:41,812
How's it my fault?

1156
01:05:41,896 --> 01:05:42,896
But, baby...

1157
01:05:43,523 --> 01:05:44,898
Yes, honey.

1158
01:05:45,692 --> 01:05:47,443
Yes, honey.

1159
01:05:47,527 --> 01:05:48,652
Love you.

1160
01:05:48,737 --> 01:05:53,032
Fifteen days. That's the Amaranto game.

1161
01:05:53,116 --> 01:05:55,117
I understand. That's your deadline.

1162
01:05:55,201 --> 01:05:56,827
I'm telling you as a friend, pay up.

1163
01:05:56,911 --> 01:05:59,747
They're super assholes
when they don't get paid, got it?

1164
01:05:59,831 --> 01:06:01,415
No, I don't.

1165
01:06:01,499 --> 01:06:03,375
You heard about that dude
who fell off a bridge?

1166
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:05,294
-Oh, yeah!
-He didn't pay.

1167
01:06:05,378 --> 01:06:07,880
And his debt was nothing
compared to yours.

1168
01:06:10,216 --> 01:06:12,384
I hope these don't give my kid diaper rash.

1169
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:28,317
He won't eat,
he's nuts over the chocolate tower.

1170
01:06:56,846 --> 01:06:59,014
Cheers. Cheers!

1171
01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:10,317
Hey! You've reached Maya.
Leave me a message, okay?

1172
01:07:10,985 --> 01:07:14,196
Baby, why weren't you at the airport?

1173
01:07:15,198 --> 01:07:16,865
Everyone's waiting.

1174
01:07:18,952 --> 01:07:23,205
I know we were gonna announce
our engagement together, but...

1175
01:07:23,289 --> 01:07:24,748
Buzz off!

1176
01:07:24,833 --> 01:07:26,583
But I told Cuco

1177
01:07:26,668 --> 01:07:29,169
and he can't keep his mouth shut.

1178
01:07:31,381 --> 01:07:33,215
Call me.

1179
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:34,883
I love you.

1180
01:07:34,968 --> 01:07:36,760
So you gonna help me?

1181
01:07:36,845 --> 01:07:39,346
Not sure. It's a tall order. And a pretty penny.

1182
01:07:39,431 --> 01:07:42,307
But tell me, what do you feel
when you're gambling?

1183
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:45,978
Same as when I'm in goal.

1184
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:48,731
Come on, you can fix anything.

1185
01:07:48,815 --> 01:07:50,983
Maybe I can do something, but...

1186
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:52,151
What?

1187
01:07:52,235 --> 01:07:55,529
I could put my money
on the Amaranto game.

1188
01:07:56,281 --> 01:07:58,073
Now you're talking!

1189
01:07:58,158 --> 01:08:00,075
We'll crush those bastards!

1190
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:02,494
No. I was thinking the opposite.

1191
01:08:03,496 --> 01:08:05,080
What do you mean? We're gonna win!

1192
01:08:05,165 --> 01:08:06,832
That depends.

1193
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:09,168
Not if you let some goals through.

1194
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:12,463
Not if you let them win.

1195
01:08:12,547 --> 01:08:14,214
No, that's not right.

1196
01:08:15,049 --> 01:08:16,967
You owe too much money.

1197
01:08:17,051 --> 01:08:19,636
The stakes are too high.

1198
01:08:19,721 --> 01:08:23,265
But what about my shut-out record?

1199
01:08:23,349 --> 01:08:25,893
Something's got to give.

1200
01:08:27,896 --> 01:08:30,689
If you won't, you won't.

1201
01:08:31,524 --> 01:08:37,112
Even though it could help your brother
break his bad streak. Think about it.

1202
01:08:37,197 --> 01:08:38,822
He can go to hell!

1203
01:08:38,907 --> 01:08:40,407
To hell with him, then.

1204
01:08:40,492 --> 01:08:42,743
You fix the problem,
don't come to me, deal?

1205
01:08:42,827 --> 01:08:45,913
-That's how it's got to be.
-Whatever. It's a free country.

1206
01:08:46,873 --> 01:08:49,875
Wasn't your woman supposed to be here?
Some bullshit engagement.

1207
01:08:49,959 --> 01:08:52,544
Bullshit my ass.

1208
01:08:52,629 --> 01:08:56,465
She's got the ring.
All we got to do is set a date.

1209
01:08:56,549 --> 01:08:58,175
Marry in June.

1210
01:08:58,259 --> 01:09:01,428
That's her hottest month
in that motor oil calendar.

1211
01:09:01,513 --> 01:09:03,305
Mine's all sticky there!

1212
01:09:03,389 --> 01:09:09,311
From that glue you use
to make piñatas for kids.

1213
01:09:09,395 --> 01:09:11,563
What are you laughing at, you hick?

1214
01:09:11,648 --> 01:09:14,483
What's up, little brother-in-law?

1215
01:09:14,567 --> 01:09:16,235
Where's the other one?

1216
01:09:18,488 --> 01:09:20,489
There he is.

1217
01:09:20,573 --> 01:09:22,032
Rope him in.

1218
01:09:22,116 --> 01:09:23,283
Little brothers-in-law,

1219
01:09:23,368 --> 01:09:28,956
my Nadia told me you always wanted
a beach house for your mom.

1220
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:31,166
Well, your dream's come true.

1221
01:09:31,251 --> 01:09:34,837
I'm building a little mansion
here on Chololos Beach.

1222
01:09:34,921 --> 01:09:36,588
Real nice.

1223
01:09:37,257 --> 01:09:40,092
Your mom and the family
will have everything they need.

1224
01:09:40,176 --> 01:09:43,345
Thank you, Don Casimiro.
I hope it's not too much trouble.

1225
01:09:43,429 --> 01:09:47,266
My boys...
Well, soccer is all they're good for.

1226
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:49,893
No trouble, little lady.

1227
01:09:49,978 --> 01:09:52,813
Don't soccer players dance?

1228
01:09:53,940 --> 01:09:56,275
Come on, darling, let's shake those bones.

1229
01:10:02,282 --> 01:10:05,450
-May I?
-You certainly may.

1230
01:10:06,452 --> 01:10:11,123
What can be done when you've
worshipped a uniform for years,

1231
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:15,544
singing, shouting, willing to die for her,

1232
01:10:15,628 --> 01:10:19,423
then she finds a more determined fan
with stronger lungs,

1233
01:10:19,507 --> 01:10:23,176
who claims he's better than you
at singing and shouting and dying?

1234
01:10:23,261 --> 01:10:25,762
Where do you leave your wounded pride?

1235
01:10:27,390 --> 01:10:30,893
I've good news and bad news.

1236
01:10:30,977 --> 01:10:32,603
Bad news first.

1237
01:10:32,687 --> 01:10:35,355
The owners gave you an ultimatum.

1238
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:40,736
If you don't score against Nopaleros,
you'll be sent down to Second Division.

1239
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:42,821
Yeah, I know. Faggots.

1240
01:10:42,906 --> 01:10:44,948
They're pathetic.

1241
01:10:45,033 --> 01:10:47,075
What's the good news?

1242
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:49,161
You're marrying a goddess.

1243
01:10:49,829 --> 01:10:53,916
And you're a top player
who can break this bad streak!

1244
01:10:54,751 --> 01:10:58,003
You're the best, got it?

1245
01:10:58,087 --> 01:10:59,421
The best!

1246
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:01,965
Okay, fuck them all.

1247
01:11:02,050 --> 01:11:04,927
That's my Cursi.

1248
01:11:05,011 --> 01:11:07,304
Stick it to them tomorrow.

1249
01:11:07,388 --> 01:11:09,097
Yeah, I'll call you. Thanks.

1250
01:11:09,182 --> 01:11:10,432
Ciao.

1251
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:24,154
Hey! You've reached Maya.
Leave me a message?

1252
01:11:24,530 --> 01:11:28,450
Maya, please. I've left a zillion messages.

1253
01:11:28,534 --> 01:11:31,954
Call me. Love you.

1254
01:11:32,038 --> 01:11:33,664
Fucking Cursi.

1255
01:11:33,748 --> 01:11:36,959
If you don't play like you used to
against Nopaleros,

1256
01:11:37,043 --> 01:11:39,836
we'll beat the crap out of you.

1257
01:11:39,921 --> 01:11:41,838
We know where you live,

1258
01:11:41,923 --> 01:11:44,591
where you train, where you hang out
and we know your car,

1259
01:11:44,676 --> 01:11:47,010
so you better play to win, asshole.

1260
01:11:47,512 --> 01:11:49,471
Can I have your autograph?

1261
01:11:49,555 --> 01:11:51,056
Sure, who's it for?

1262
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:53,308
-For Porky.
-My pleasure.

1263
01:11:53,393 --> 01:11:55,185
Porky?

1264
01:11:55,269 --> 01:11:58,772
And one for Yenni. Spelled "Y" double "N."

1265
01:11:58,856 --> 01:12:01,274
You better score or we'll fuck you up.

1266
01:12:01,943 --> 01:12:06,238
Ever since soccer became a business,
everything rides on results.

1267
01:12:06,322 --> 01:12:09,992
No more joy in the game, only fear remains.

1268
01:12:10,076 --> 01:12:13,370
No one takes chances
because they cannot fail.

1269
01:12:13,454 --> 01:12:17,541
It's like living with a gun to your head.

1270
01:12:17,625 --> 01:12:19,835
Rudo! One second.

1271
01:12:20,753 --> 01:12:23,880
You are 90 minutes away
from breaking the shut-out record.

1272
01:12:23,965 --> 01:12:25,632
Can you taste it?

1273
01:12:25,717 --> 01:12:31,596
No, I can't taste it, I got 90 minutes
to break it or die trying.

1274
01:12:31,681 --> 01:12:34,850
How did you come this far?
Where do you get your talent?

1275
01:12:34,934 --> 01:12:38,353
Ever since I was a kid
I wanted to be the best goalie.

1276
01:12:38,438 --> 01:12:42,024
Sometimes I'd pretend they were
handing me the World Cup.

1277
01:12:42,108 --> 01:12:45,110
-Best of luck. Thanks.
-No, thank you. Hi to Tlachatlán!

1278
01:12:48,114 --> 01:12:54,369
Guess who's mooning about town,
enjoying a budding romance?

1279
01:12:54,454 --> 01:12:55,537
Who might that be?

1280
01:12:55,621 --> 01:13:01,001
That dashing national team player
"Gringa" Roldán and TV hostess Maya Vega!

1281
01:13:01,085 --> 01:13:02,044
No fucking way!

1282
01:13:02,128 --> 01:13:07,632
Wasn't she dating that other player,
the lousy singer who never scores goals?

1283
01:13:08,134 --> 01:13:10,886
Lousy, your ass, bitch!

1284
01:13:10,970 --> 01:13:14,723
She has traded failure for success.
Let's take a look.

1285
01:13:14,807 --> 01:13:17,976
Maya! Tell us about your new romance?

1286
01:13:18,061 --> 01:13:20,562
I'm thrilled, right, honey?

1287
01:13:21,314 --> 01:13:22,981
I'm gonna kill her!

1288
01:13:24,150 --> 01:13:25,817
Hey! You've reached Maya. Leave me a...

1289
01:13:25,902 --> 01:13:29,071
Answer, you fucking whore, answer!

1290
01:13:29,155 --> 01:13:31,990
I just love how they call him "Gringa."
It's super cosmopolitan.

1291
01:13:33,618 --> 01:13:36,536
Fucking whore! Fucking bitching whore!

1292
01:13:36,621 --> 01:13:40,082
-Take it easy.
-Take it easy, asshole?

1293
01:13:41,084 --> 01:13:45,087
-It's all good, Cursi.
-All good? Bullshit!

1294
01:13:49,926 --> 01:13:53,678
They're fucking my broad!
She's fucking some other idiot!

1295
01:13:54,055 --> 01:13:55,889
-He found out!
-Who told him?

1296
01:13:55,973 --> 01:13:58,850
-It was on TV!
-You bastards knew?

1297
01:13:58,935 --> 01:14:00,102
Chill out.

1298
01:14:05,358 --> 01:14:06,858
That fucking whore!

1299
01:14:06,943 --> 01:14:09,194
I'm gonna kill her.

1300
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:14,074
I'm gonna kill that bitch
and that fucking faggot Gringa!

1301
01:14:15,118 --> 01:14:17,035
Get the doctor!

1302
01:14:20,832 --> 01:14:21,915
Stop it, Cursi! Get back here!

1303
01:14:21,999 --> 01:14:23,500
Get him!

1304
01:14:28,047 --> 01:14:31,508
Hurry, Doc. He flipped out.

1305
01:14:31,592 --> 01:14:33,760
-Tranquilize him.
-Give him a shot.

1306
01:14:33,845 --> 01:14:35,637
The problem with loving the ball

1307
01:14:35,721 --> 01:14:39,307
is that everyone wants her
and she wants everyone.

1308
01:14:39,392 --> 01:14:41,601
That's why you've got to take care of her.

1309
01:14:53,865 --> 01:14:54,948
-Hello?
-Hello?

1310
01:14:55,032 --> 01:14:57,242
Hey, mango. How are you?

1311
01:14:57,326 --> 01:14:59,161
Bad, honey, real bad.

1312
01:15:00,079 --> 01:15:02,914
-What's wrong?
-They took all my points away!

1313
01:15:03,249 --> 01:15:07,502
I only needed 10 to become a Ruby
Sales Rep and win the Caribbean cruise!

1314
01:15:07,587 --> 01:15:09,588
What happened?

1315
01:15:10,590 --> 01:15:13,884
I don't know. They added them up wrong.

1316
01:15:13,968 --> 01:15:18,972
They put me back where I started,
Crystal Sales Rep. It's not fair!

1317
01:15:19,056 --> 01:15:21,308
Of course it's not fair.

1318
01:15:21,392 --> 01:15:26,021
Don't worry, mango, I'll help you
like you helped me. Take it easy.

1319
01:15:26,105 --> 01:15:27,397
Thanks, Beto.

1320
01:15:27,481 --> 01:15:30,483
Come on, babe, I'm your husband.

1321
01:15:30,568 --> 01:15:32,527
Everything's gonna be all right.

1322
01:15:32,612 --> 01:15:34,946
You're right.

1323
01:15:35,031 --> 01:15:38,200
Now get some rest.
You got a record to break tomorrow.

1324
01:15:38,868 --> 01:15:41,203
Guess so, huh? The record.

1325
01:15:41,287 --> 01:15:45,332
You get some rest, too.

1326
01:15:45,416 --> 01:15:46,917
Kisses.

1327
01:16:00,431 --> 01:16:02,349
Hello? Baton?

1328
01:16:02,433 --> 01:16:04,017
Rudo, how's tricks?

1329
01:16:04,101 --> 01:16:06,061
How many goals do I let through?

1330
01:16:06,145 --> 01:16:08,313
Games are won by a single goal.

1331
01:16:10,650 --> 01:16:13,109
You got a deal. I'm in.

1332
01:16:13,236 --> 01:16:14,569
-You're positive?
-Yes.

1333
01:16:14,654 --> 01:16:17,113
-Because my savings will be on the line.
-Sure.

1334
01:16:17,198 --> 01:16:19,866
Don't worry. Good night.

1335
01:16:28,125 --> 01:16:29,751
The scalpers are making a killing.

1336
01:16:29,835 --> 01:16:31,670
It is a blood duel!

1337
01:16:31,754 --> 01:16:33,255
Two brothers. Head to head.

1338
01:16:33,339 --> 01:16:36,675
-Rudo is at his peak!
-Cursi's on a bad streak!

1339
01:16:36,759 --> 01:16:40,595
Will Rudo break the shut-out record?

1340
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:42,597
His brother won't let it happen.

1341
01:16:42,682 --> 01:16:49,312
Even if he's stuck in limbo
after his meteoric ascent.

1342
01:16:49,397 --> 01:16:54,067
What is Cursi feeling after the way
he's lived these past few months?

1343
01:16:54,151 --> 01:16:58,029
The brothers' duel has captivated
the entire country.

1344
01:17:06,747 --> 01:17:11,626
Listen, guys,
pay attention to goddamn Mafafo.

1345
01:17:11,711 --> 01:17:15,046
That guy likes sneaking behind
our defenders and he's a bitch to cover.

1346
01:17:16,716 --> 01:17:18,216
Cursi!

1347
01:17:21,262 --> 01:17:24,556
To the bench.
You're sedated and I can't risk it.

1348
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:26,474
-Yes, sir.
-Garcia, you're in for Cursi.

1349
01:17:26,559 --> 01:17:30,061
Same plays, but please, make the goals.

1350
01:17:31,230 --> 01:17:33,231
Gather round.

1351
01:17:34,066 --> 01:17:35,900
Kill the music!

1352
01:17:36,819 --> 01:17:39,988
Our father who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name...

1353
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:01,801
Good luck. We have to win.

1354
01:18:01,886 --> 01:18:03,219
Yeah.

1355
01:18:13,105 --> 01:18:16,566
Bruno Lopez, mysterious coach.
Says nothing until the last minute.

1356
01:18:16,650 --> 01:18:22,572
Here's the line-up. Breaking news,
Cursi's on the bench, he's out.

1357
01:18:32,124 --> 01:18:34,334
Ninety minutes to the record, Rudo!

1358
01:18:44,553 --> 01:18:47,472
Kiss my ass, Rudo!

1359
01:18:55,689 --> 01:18:57,273
Hey, kid!

1360
01:18:57,358 --> 01:18:58,691
What?

1361
01:18:58,776 --> 01:19:01,236
Take a message to Cursi on the bench.

1362
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:02,821
No way. I can't budge.

1363
01:19:02,905 --> 01:19:04,823
Come on. The other kid can cover for you.

1364
01:19:04,907 --> 01:19:06,241
I'm not allowed.

1365
01:19:06,325 --> 01:19:09,119
-I'll give you an autographed jersey.
-Fuck you, Rudo!

1366
01:19:09,203 --> 01:19:10,954
Fucking faggots.

1367
01:19:11,705 --> 01:19:13,373
What do I tell him?

1368
01:19:13,457 --> 01:19:17,627
Ask him if he's on the bench
because I scare him.

1369
01:19:18,629 --> 01:19:20,463
Hurry up!

1370
01:19:30,724 --> 01:19:32,642
Amaranto moves fast.

1371
01:19:32,726 --> 01:19:37,063
Fernandez upsets the Nopalero defense,
an easy ball into Rudo's hands.

1372
01:19:37,148 --> 01:19:38,940
No, Rudo drops the ball!

1373
01:19:39,024 --> 01:19:40,483
Here comes Farias! He shoots!

1374
01:19:40,568 --> 01:19:43,361
-Out of bounds!
-What a mistake by Rudo!

1375
01:19:43,446 --> 01:19:45,196
How could you drop that beach ball?

1376
01:19:45,281 --> 01:19:47,198
Seems like Rudo doesn't want the record.

1377
01:19:47,283 --> 01:19:48,783
What a stupid mistake.

1378
01:19:48,868 --> 01:19:50,285
What a jackass!

1379
01:19:50,369 --> 01:19:53,037
Rudo's sloppiness puts pressure
on the defense.

1380
01:19:53,706 --> 01:19:55,540
Zapallo?

1381
01:19:57,042 --> 01:19:58,960
Double my wager.

1382
01:19:59,044 --> 01:20:00,879
Did you see what just happened?

1383
01:20:00,963 --> 01:20:04,799
Then stop farting around and double it.

1384
01:20:25,905 --> 01:20:27,655
Come on! Spread out!

1385
01:20:27,740 --> 01:20:30,241
Nopaleros stampedes down the right.

1386
01:20:30,326 --> 01:20:34,496
Serrano reaches the end line,
sends back a pass.

1387
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:36,372
Mafafo kicks. Off the post!

1388
01:20:36,457 --> 01:20:37,916
Amaranto is miraculously saved!

1389
01:20:43,797 --> 01:20:45,298
Come on, Beto!

1390
01:20:45,382 --> 01:20:46,966
Keep your eyes open!

1391
01:20:47,635 --> 01:20:49,302
Let's go!

1392
01:20:50,137 --> 01:20:51,137
What did he say?

1393
01:20:51,222 --> 01:20:54,015
He says you've got no fucking idea
what he's been through.

1394
01:20:54,099 --> 01:20:55,600
He said that? What are you laughing at?

1395
01:20:55,684 --> 01:20:57,352
Here they come!

1396
01:20:57,436 --> 01:20:59,395
Rudo comes out late, Mena takes aim.

1397
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:02,982
Terrible kick! Horrible!

1398
01:21:03,067 --> 01:21:06,486
Mena blew it, he won't get
another chance like that.

1399
01:21:06,570 --> 01:21:10,198
-The ref signals the end of the first half.
-Be right back.

1400
01:21:10,282 --> 01:21:12,867
The best part of the game is yet to come.

1401
01:21:12,952 --> 01:21:15,203
-Lend me your sister, Rudo!
-You're one lucky fuck.

1402
01:21:15,287 --> 01:21:16,538
Ain't I?

1403
01:21:34,932 --> 01:21:38,017
Pay today or you're dead

1404
01:21:50,990 --> 01:21:54,826
Hello? Listen, I'll pay, I swear.
Just give me a little more time.

1405
01:21:54,910 --> 01:21:58,580
How the hell will you pay,
if you won't do what it takes?

1406
01:21:58,664 --> 01:22:00,790
Baton?

1407
01:22:00,874 --> 01:22:03,751
What do you want from me?
I'm trying, but it's not so simple.

1408
01:22:04,628 --> 01:22:07,463
Don't fuck with me, bastard!

1409
01:22:07,548 --> 01:22:10,425
Try harder. It's already the second half!

1410
01:22:10,509 --> 01:22:14,679
Did you see them play? They suck.
They couldn't score without a goalie.

1411
01:22:14,763 --> 01:22:18,099
Then make the goal yourself,
but let them win!

1412
01:22:18,934 --> 01:22:20,810
Why don't they send in Tato?

1413
01:22:20,894 --> 01:22:22,562
Maybe he could do something.

1414
01:22:22,646 --> 01:22:24,272
He has woman trouble.

1415
01:22:24,356 --> 01:22:27,358
Worry about your own ass!
Concentrate on what you've got to do!

1416
01:22:27,443 --> 01:22:30,612
Can't you see there's a noose
around your neck?

1417
01:22:30,696 --> 01:22:32,488
Don't you get it?

1418
01:22:32,573 --> 01:22:35,325
You've got to lose!

1419
01:22:48,881 --> 01:22:50,381
Listen up, men!

1420
01:22:50,466 --> 01:22:52,967
It's zero-zero,
and you don't win a game with zeros.

1421
01:22:53,052 --> 01:22:56,512
When it's this close,
talent and balls make the difference!

1422
01:22:56,597 --> 01:22:59,932
Play with talent and balls!

1423
01:23:01,435 --> 01:23:03,019
-Who are we?
-Amaranto!

1424
01:23:03,103 --> 01:23:04,979
-What do we play with?
-Balls!

1425
01:23:05,814 --> 01:23:10,026
Your bro's on the bench because he found
out Gringa Roldán's screwing Maya,

1426
01:23:10,110 --> 01:23:11,319
and they had to sedate him.

1427
01:23:11,403 --> 01:23:14,072
-What's it to you, asshole?
-Nothing.

1428
01:23:14,156 --> 01:23:17,075
I screwed her good a long time ago.

1429
01:23:18,702 --> 01:23:20,370
Suck my dick, Cursi!

1430
01:23:21,455 --> 01:23:25,541
Let me grab your ass, Cursi!

1431
01:23:27,544 --> 01:23:30,004
Fucking Cursi wuss!

1432
01:23:30,089 --> 01:23:33,591
Dive between my legs, Rudo!

1433
01:23:45,979 --> 01:23:49,482
We're expecting a vibrant second half,
Rudo's close to the record,

1434
01:23:49,566 --> 01:23:51,609
45 minutes away.

1435
01:24:03,455 --> 01:24:04,497
Kid!

1436
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:08,334
Come here!

1437
01:24:09,002 --> 01:24:12,088
Tell Cursi to get a grip.

1438
01:24:13,507 --> 01:24:16,259
I hate seeing him like this.
Tell him, "Chin up."

1439
01:24:16,343 --> 01:24:20,179
What'll Mom say
if she sees him crying over a whore?

1440
01:24:20,264 --> 01:24:21,889
That's really long.

1441
01:24:21,974 --> 01:24:24,058
Go tell him before you forget.

1442
01:24:24,143 --> 01:24:27,145
Send it over!

1443
01:24:27,813 --> 01:24:29,105
-Hello?
-Hi, Bruno. Baton here.

1444
01:24:29,189 --> 01:24:30,565
Not now.

1445
01:24:30,649 --> 01:24:33,943
Why are you waiting, send in Cursi!
This game was made for him.

1446
01:24:34,027 --> 01:24:36,863
Cursi's done. He's in no condition to play.

1447
01:24:36,947 --> 01:24:40,408
You've got to send him in! Or you want
the world to know your cut per player?

1448
01:24:40,492 --> 01:24:42,660
Fuck you! Now he stays on the bench!

1449
01:24:42,745 --> 01:24:45,413
Really? And will your wife be upset

1450
01:24:45,497 --> 01:24:48,082
when she finds out
you're banging Muteboy Villegas?

1451
01:24:48,167 --> 01:24:49,625
Fuck off!

1452
01:24:49,710 --> 01:24:51,377
Prick!

1453
01:24:51,462 --> 01:24:53,463
Pass it!

1454
01:24:57,009 --> 01:24:58,634
-Cursi! Start warming up!
-Me?

1455
01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:00,887
Yes, you!
Let's see you break that bad streak.

1456
01:25:00,971 --> 01:25:02,472
In you go, asshole!

1457
01:25:08,061 --> 01:25:13,483
Cursi, Rudo says your mama is a whore.

1458
01:25:16,028 --> 01:25:18,237
Out of my way.

1459
01:25:18,322 --> 01:25:20,782
Finally, a smart substitution.

1460
01:25:20,866 --> 01:25:23,701
There's Cursi.
The moment we've been waiting for.

1461
01:25:28,916 --> 01:25:31,250
He's seeking revenge
after sitting on the bench.

1462
01:25:31,335 --> 01:25:33,795
Maybe Cursi can break the deadlock.

1463
01:25:33,879 --> 01:25:36,339
If he fails he'll be sent down
to Second Division.

1464
01:25:36,423 --> 01:25:38,966
He's got everything to win, nothing to lose.

1465
01:25:50,062 --> 01:25:51,979
Cursi sucks your dick, Rudo!

1466
01:25:52,064 --> 01:25:54,816
Go, Cursi! It's all yours!

1467
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:58,945
Cursi on the move, passes to Lopez,

1468
01:25:59,029 --> 01:26:01,489
who sends back a beautiful pass.

1469
01:26:01,573 --> 01:26:03,241
Cursi one on one against his brother.

1470
01:26:03,325 --> 01:26:04,408
What a duel! He shoots!

1471
01:26:04,493 --> 01:26:06,661
Goal!

1472
01:26:11,458 --> 01:26:13,125
-What a goal.
-Shut up.

1473
01:26:13,210 --> 01:26:17,630
-How the fuck did that happen?
-You left me alone.

1474
01:26:20,676 --> 01:26:22,760
String, kite, string!

1475
01:26:23,262 --> 01:26:24,637
What?

1476
01:26:26,265 --> 01:26:30,059
Offside! Incredible! What a close play!

1477
01:26:30,143 --> 01:26:32,061
Cursi can't break the curse!

1478
01:26:32,145 --> 01:26:33,813
Fortune remains on Rudo's side.

1479
01:26:34,481 --> 01:26:40,528
There's no offside! You wanker!

1480
01:26:40,612 --> 01:26:42,405
Hang in there, Rudo!

1481
01:26:42,489 --> 01:26:45,491
The ref is blind!

1482
01:26:46,827 --> 01:26:48,327
You get my message, bro?

1483
01:26:48,412 --> 01:26:50,872
-My mom is not a whore!
-I didn't say that!

1484
01:26:50,956 --> 01:26:53,082
What's wrong with you?

1485
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:57,587
What's wrong with those boys?
Beto must have said something.

1486
01:27:02,926 --> 01:27:04,594
This'll calm you down.

1487
01:27:14,646 --> 01:27:16,314
Amaranto presses on.

1488
01:27:16,398 --> 01:27:19,901
Cursi shakes off a foul
through the defender's legs!

1489
01:27:19,985 --> 01:27:21,903
Passes to the center.

1490
01:27:21,987 --> 01:27:23,905
What, Zapallo?

1491
01:27:23,989 --> 01:27:27,158
Don't fuck with me, we can't lose.

1492
01:27:28,577 --> 01:27:31,245
Don't break my balls! Games last 90 minutes.

1493
01:27:31,330 --> 01:27:33,247
Cursi dribbles in.
Rudo forgets about the ball.

1494
01:27:33,332 --> 01:27:35,458
The final minute lasts 60 seconds!

1495
01:27:35,542 --> 01:27:38,377
Penalty! What'd I tell you?

1496
01:27:38,462 --> 01:27:42,381
The ref's blind! That's no penalty!

1497
01:27:42,466 --> 01:27:44,300
Now that's a penalty.

1498
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:46,135
-No way, ref!
-Of course not!

1499
01:27:46,219 --> 01:27:48,054
What a stupid play by Rudo.

1500
01:27:48,138 --> 01:27:51,933
His record is in jeopardy.

1501
01:27:52,017 --> 01:27:53,643
There's something fishy here.

1502
01:27:53,727 --> 01:27:57,063
-I didn't touch him!
-Don't lie! You're not a politician!

1503
01:27:57,147 --> 01:27:59,649
I didn't touch you!

1504
01:28:01,151 --> 01:28:03,444
Does it hurt? Or only when you laugh?

1505
01:28:03,528 --> 01:28:04,779
Get up!

1506
01:28:04,863 --> 01:28:06,739
Let Centipede take it!

1507
01:28:12,829 --> 01:28:15,289
Give me a shot.

1508
01:28:15,374 --> 01:28:16,874
Coach wants me to take it.

1509
01:28:16,959 --> 01:28:18,876
I know, but give me a shot anyway.
I wanna break my bad streak.

1510
01:28:18,961 --> 01:28:20,127
Centipede!

1511
01:28:20,212 --> 01:28:21,712
Fuck!

1512
01:28:24,633 --> 01:28:27,551
The moment of truth comes for everyone.

1513
01:28:34,935 --> 01:28:36,602
I just want you to know,

1514
01:28:36,687 --> 01:28:39,730
I don't care if you forgive me,
I just wanna make sure you're okay.

1515
01:28:39,815 --> 01:28:42,024
Shoot to the right, please.

1516
01:28:42,693 --> 01:28:43,985
What?

1517
01:28:44,069 --> 01:28:47,446
Tension on the field.
What are those two saying?

1518
01:28:47,531 --> 01:28:50,282
Nothing friendly, I assure you.

1519
01:28:50,367 --> 01:28:52,868
Tato, you're gonna be okay, bro.

1520
01:28:57,082 --> 01:29:00,584
-Beto! We're brothers, man.
-What?

1521
01:29:00,669 --> 01:29:02,336
We're brothers.

1522
01:29:03,338 --> 01:29:05,423
Please, shoot to the right.

1523
01:29:05,507 --> 01:29:06,507
To the right.

1524
01:29:06,591 --> 01:29:08,718
Come on! Let's play! Time's almost up.

1525
01:29:08,802 --> 01:29:10,302
Take your positions.

1526
01:29:14,599 --> 01:29:16,976
Rudo, one more minute!

1527
01:29:25,318 --> 01:29:26,861
Minute 89,

1528
01:29:26,945 --> 01:29:30,114
two brothers face off at 12 paces,

1529
01:29:30,198 --> 01:29:32,658
one ball, one record at stake.

1530
01:29:36,747 --> 01:29:38,581
Shoot!

1531
01:29:47,549 --> 01:29:49,216
The game ends with this kick.

1532
01:29:57,184 --> 01:29:58,976
Shoot!

1533
01:30:03,815 --> 01:30:06,442
The stadium is delirious.

1534
01:30:10,238 --> 01:30:11,530
Rudo against Cursi.

1535
01:30:11,656 --> 01:30:13,157
A family divided.

1536
01:30:19,164 --> 01:30:20,206
Shoot.

1537
01:30:48,610 --> 01:30:50,277
Incredible!

1538
01:30:56,827 --> 01:31:02,665
Rudo snatches the glory
from his own brother!

1539
01:31:02,874 --> 01:31:04,500
-Fucking A!
-Why is it always penalties?

1540
01:31:09,714 --> 01:31:15,010
Rudo's the hero!
He breaks the record! Cursi is done for!

1541
01:31:15,095 --> 01:31:17,346
Those bastards!

1542
01:31:17,430 --> 01:31:18,556
YOU DID IT, RUDO!

1543
01:31:19,724 --> 01:31:21,976
Goalie, goalie!

1544
01:31:22,060 --> 01:31:24,562
-I should've taken the shot.
-Chill out, man.

1545
01:31:36,700 --> 01:31:39,076
Penalty means punishment.

1546
01:31:39,161 --> 01:31:42,830
But only one man is penalized,
the one who fails.

1547
01:31:42,914 --> 01:31:45,040
The winner is covered in glory.

1548
01:31:45,125 --> 01:31:47,334
If both are penalized,

1549
01:31:47,419 --> 01:31:51,338
that means the grand game of life

1550
01:31:51,423 --> 01:31:55,259
has defeated the beautiful game of soccer.

1551
01:32:05,854 --> 01:32:11,442
We're gonna fuck you up, asshole!
Son of a bitch! We know where you live!

1552
01:32:12,110 --> 01:32:15,446
Cursi was sent to Second Division.

1553
01:32:15,530 --> 01:32:19,325
He never got his mojo back
and quickly faded away.

1554
01:32:19,409 --> 01:32:22,703
He quit soccer and moved to Chilpancingo,

1555
01:32:22,787 --> 01:32:26,624
where he runs a karaoke bar
owned by his brother-in-law, Casimiro.

1556
01:32:26,708 --> 01:32:31,045
Every night, from 8:00 to 10:00,
Cursi rules the stage.

1557
01:32:41,139 --> 01:32:42,806
Shit! What the hell?

1558
01:32:42,891 --> 01:32:44,808
What's with this asshole?

1559
01:32:47,479 --> 01:32:49,313
Why'd you cut me off?

1560
01:32:58,698 --> 01:33:01,867
Rudo was lucky. They didn't kill him.

1561
01:33:01,952 --> 01:33:04,745
The bullets ruined only one leg.

1562
01:33:04,829 --> 01:33:07,081
He had to quit soccer,

1563
01:33:07,165 --> 01:33:11,001
but his shut-out record still stands.

1564
01:33:11,086 --> 01:33:16,632
He coaches a Second Division team
his brother-in-law Casimiro bought.

1565
01:33:16,716 --> 01:33:19,385
Now he gambles from the bench.

1566
01:33:30,438 --> 01:33:32,022
What's up, dude?

1567
01:33:32,107 --> 01:33:33,607
Nothing.

1568
01:33:36,736 --> 01:33:38,362
What's happening?

1569
01:33:38,446 --> 01:33:40,114
The usual.

1570
01:33:41,366 --> 01:33:44,535
Mom's house turned out awesome, huh?

1571
01:33:45,370 --> 01:33:46,537
Yeah.

1572
01:33:47,539 --> 01:33:49,623
Fucking Casimiro, he's one fat cat.

1573
01:33:49,708 --> 01:33:51,208
He sure is.

1574
01:33:52,544 --> 01:33:54,378
Nadia looks real nice pregnant, no?

1575
01:33:55,380 --> 01:33:57,381
She's a whale.

1576
01:33:57,465 --> 01:33:59,008
She's ready to pop.

1577
01:33:59,092 --> 01:34:01,427
Seems like they're moving too fast.

1578
01:34:01,511 --> 01:34:03,178
That's their business, bro.

1579
01:34:05,682 --> 01:34:07,266
Sing something, okay?

1580
01:34:09,102 --> 01:34:10,936
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

1581
01:34:11,438 --> 01:34:13,314
All right. What do you want to hear?

1582
01:34:14,107 --> 01:34:16,233
The one...

1583
01:34:17,277 --> 01:34:19,945
That one you're good at.

1584
01:34:20,864 --> 01:34:22,531
Which one?

1585
01:34:25,118 --> 01:34:26,785
You know the one.

1586
01:34:26,870 --> 01:34:29,997
You're on. But sing with me, all right?

1587
01:34:30,081 --> 01:34:31,540
Remember...

1588
01:34:33,209 --> 01:34:36,420
I want you to want me

1589
01:34:37,422 --> 01:34:40,841
I need you to need me

1590
01:34:41,509 --> 01:34:42,801
I'd love you to love me

1591
01:34:42,802 --> 01:34:44,261
I'd love you to love me

1592
01:34:45,263 --> 01:34:48,766
I'm begging you to beg me

1593
01:34:58,526 --> 01:34:59,860
And me?

1594
01:35:01,780 --> 01:35:05,115
The Verdusco brothers
made me lose my shirt.

1595
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:08,494
I bet everything on Amaranto to win.

1596
01:35:08,578 --> 01:35:11,246
That tie game didn't do me any good.

1597
01:35:11,623 --> 01:35:13,248
But I'm still gallivanting about.

1598
01:35:13,333 --> 01:35:17,711
Someone has to find the diamonds
in the rough to keep the ball rolling.

1599
01:35:31,976 --> 01:35:34,937
Pardon me, who are those twins
playing the wings?

1600
01:35:35,021 --> 01:35:36,855
They're Hector and Nestor Morales.

1601
01:35:36,940 --> 01:35:38,816
The best midfielders in the state.

1602
01:35:39,484 --> 01:35:40,984
Lovely.

1603
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:44,988
All for the love of the game.
