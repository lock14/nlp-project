1
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,100
It's possible.

2
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,900
Get outta here.

3
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,200
Why, most women at one time or
another faked it.

4
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,200
Well, they haven't faked it with me.

5
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,200
Ohh, right right, I forgot,
you're a man.

6
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,600
You don't think that I could tell
the difference?

7
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:58,400
Oh, Ohh, Ohh...

8
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,000
Hey, you ok?

9
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:12,200
Oh, Ohh, Yes! Yes! Yes! Oh, Ohh...
Ohh, right there! Yes! Yes!

10
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:16,400
Ohh, Ohhh...

11
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I want what she's having.
Yeah, we're going to hell.

12
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,700
Fuck me, please.

13
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
You're bad.
I'm gonna be late for my flight.

14
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,600
I don't care.

15
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,500
- I can not see you for three whole months.
- Don't be a baby.

16
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:07,300
- I love you.
- Careful, I may just marry you and ruin your life.

17
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,800
You better...

18
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:15,600
Fine, go be with your...

19
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,100
dead people, Doctor.

20
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:23,000
Figuring out how they die is gonna help people.

21
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,500
Your hands are so cold.

22
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,300
Time's gonna feel like nothing ok.

23
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,600
I miss you already.

24
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,400
- Love you.
- And I love you.

25
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,900
T..Ted Gray?

26
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:57,000
- Ben Stravinsky.
- I am. Ben Stravinsky.

27
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
- Take it you'll be showing me around?
- Ted Gray, I'm all over it.

28
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,000
Here we are.

29
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
County morgue. Ze real banana.

30
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,400
If you check out from any unnatural or

31
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,400
unexplained cause within the city limits
will end up here.

32
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
As resident we get full access.

33
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:28,100
Ah right. This it Pathology Room No. 1.

34
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:32,600
It's been pretty slow lately, but holiday season's
around the corner, it should hopefully pick up.

35
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,900
Certain people around here couldn't
possibly be anymore annoying.

36
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,100
Beg your pardon?

37
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,800
- Oh no.
- What?

38
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,300
Some of these guys last year,
they decided that...

39
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,800
...they were gonna be God's
gift to this place.

40
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,900
Hey, you have a girlfriend?

41
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,500
As pathologists, we'll learn
the nature of disease and its causes...

42
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,300
its processes, development, consequences.

43
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:16,600
But far from more than that. I'd like to think that
the pathologists has offered a window to God if you will.

44
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,400
Now, it maybe said...

45
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:24,900
the pathology is a study in all things
human, save for the soul of course.

46
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:28,700
But it is in that particular branch of
pathology known as forensics

47
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:32,400
that we will delve into what it means
to be inhuman.

48
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,200
You will see the perversion...

49
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:39,200
and the corruption of the flesh
by all means unnatural.

50
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,900
By violence.

51
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,200
By toxins.

52
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,600
By madness.

53
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,600
And then we will work backwards,
always back...

54
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,500
To that original pristine design
to determine the offending cause of death.

55
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,600
Dr. Morris?

56
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,500
- Oh, you're...
- Hi.

57
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,700
Dr. Stravinsky, I want you
to hunt down Jake Gallo.

58
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,200
Tell him, I want to see him chop-chop.

59
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,100
Yes sir.

60
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,800
Ahh... quite a pleasure.
I've heard a great deal about you.

61
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,400
How was Africa?

62
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,300
Was a challenge. Quite humbling though.

63
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:25,900
- A very privileged year.
- Indeed.

64
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:29,900
I spoke to your future father-in-law this morning,
he's quite proud of you, you know.

65
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,400
And Gwendolyn.

66
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,800
Have had the chance to see her
since you've been home?

67
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,600
- Only briefly.
- Oh, that's a pity.

68
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,200
I have known that girl since she was
barely out of braces.

69
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,900
She's become quite a woman.

70
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:51,100
You are indeed privileged
and evidently quite talented.

71
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,300
Dr. Morris.

72
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,200
Dr. Gallo.

73
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,700
I would like you to meet Dr. Gray.

74
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,500
Hello Doctor Gray.

75
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,800
Ted comes to us top of his class from Harvard.

76
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,700
- Eighteen weeks at Bellview in New York city.
- Ohh, patient?

77
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:16,400
Before being accepted in the UNICEF program in Legos,
where he has been for the past four months.

78
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,400
Bleeding heart. I cut one of those
in half this morning.

79
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,800
Jake is our young... star in residents.

80
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,900
Single-handedly solved the Hordon family murders.

81
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:33,300
If it weren't for a little student intership,
I think the FBI would still be fingering around.

82
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,200
Damn.

83
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:41,600
I expect you two would get along quite well.

84
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:46,400
Doctors, this is a simple case of kidney failure.

85
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,900
Blood in the urine, general swelling.

86
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:52,300
Hey, look at his skin.
Looks like cheddar cheese.

87
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,500
- Excuse me. Pardon my interject.
- By all means.

88
00:07:55,700 --> 00:08:02,200
- He may interject?
- Given the boy's medical history, I believe
he died during a state of hypoxia and asthma attack.

89
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,700
Fresh out of medical books.

90
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:09,300
Oh forgive me, that seems more like a hypercondural
conclusion than an answer for the deceased.

91
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,200
11 year old boy, overweight.

92
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:15,100
This last report, Daniel stated he's
been ridiculed at school for his weight.

93
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:20,600
The weight he started gaining when he began
taking Pediapred to treat an acute asthma condition.

94
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:24,200
You'll gonna notice there's no trace
of the steroid in blood or bladder.

95
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:28,200
- Blah blah blah blah blah.
- Is there a problem?

96
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:32,200
- Doctor please, continue.
- He stop taking the steroid.

97
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:37,300
In his mind the abuse he suffered from his peers
for being fat was worse than the asthma itself.

98
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:43,300
Finally during a field-trip to the zoo,
he died from a severe attack.

99
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:47,300
One can't disregard psychology
when forming a diagnosis.

100
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:54,700
Ted Gray! Home Run!
No question about it. Acute asthma.

101
00:08:55,900 --> 00:09:03,500
Uhh... no.
I think it's coagulated nasal mucus.

102
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,300
Death by booger.

103
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,500
Sorry man, I didn't see you there.

104
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,800
You wanted to know if there was a problem?

105
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,800
- There is one. We don't like you.
- That's not a problem.

106
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,900
Yeah, so I met Dr. Morris today.

107
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,400
I think the guy still has a crush on you

108
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,500
or me.

109
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,500
Can't be too sure.

110
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,800
Yeah, yeah I'm st.. of course I'm still excited.
The place is beautiful.

111
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,300
The school's beautiful, everything's beautiful.

112
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,700
You're beautiful.

113
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:04,900
Hey, I gotta get up in four hours,
you're corrupting me.

114
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,700
Yeah, I love you too.
Bye.

115
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,300
Alright everybody, gather around.

116
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,400
I want you to meet my friend Carl.

117
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,800
- Hello Carl.
- Hey Carl.

118
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,500
Now several weeks back, his doctors
recorded that Carl

119
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,100
was experiencing frequent nauseous,

120
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:38,500
discomfort while urinating, dizziness.
- You're describing my weekend.

121
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:42,500
His symptoms increased in severity until
Carl decided it's was time to pay us a visit.

122
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:49,600
Jesus. You killed him.

123
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:53,300
Oh ohh Jesus!

124
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,800
Dr. Gray has quite nicely severed
the parametral tract.

125
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,800
Disconnecting Carl's nerve from his brain,

126
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,500
which had momentarily forgotten it was dead.

127
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:10,400
A decidedly entertaining although unnecessary
display of skill. Thank you, young man.

128
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:15,800
- Dr. Gray. Dr. Gray.
- Ted.

129
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,900
- Ted Gray
- Ben Stravinsky.

130
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:22,000
That was pretty over the top today huh?

131
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,800
Yeah.

132
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,500
- I'm sorry, you were saying?
- Oh... no... the whole...

133
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:44,500
- Take care.
- No, yeah.. of course, of course.
It's just like pap... it's pretty cool.

134
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,600
This is what we like to call the food stand.

135
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
You guys haven't even got that cage open yet?

136
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,000
Why are we here?

137
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,700
All of us. In here instead of out there.

138
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,800
Why?

139
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,600
Because we prefer the company.

140
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,600
This kind of company.

141
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,500
Am I right?

142
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,900
Vernish.

143
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:52,900
When I think about them, you know, out there...

144
00:12:53,600 --> 00:13:00,800
...in their rooms, on the streets,
utilising public transportation...

145
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:06,000
...downloading pornography,
ordering their lives out of catalogs...

146
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:09,500
...shitting out processed foods,
cashing welfare checks...

147
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:15,500
...opining, bitching, moaning, consuming, copulating...

148
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,600
...and multiplying.
It makes me sick.

149
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:25,900
What we need, brothers and sisters,
is less of them

150
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,500
and more of this.

151
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,700
Don't you agree, Dr. Gray?

152
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,800
I can see your point,
not sure I agree.

153
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:42,400
Ah well, nobody's perfect.

154
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,400
Not even you, Dr. Gallo.

155
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:54,200
- Ohh God!
- You don't wanna be cutting into the poop pipe, kid.

156
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,200
That stuff will kill you.

157
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,800
Well, we gotta go at some point right?

158
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:07,800
In that case, wanna come and join us?
We're heading to Thirteen Stones.

159
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:16,600
Ohh... doctors' in.

160
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:22,500
Mother fucker...
Fucking hurts man!

161
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,200
Alright.

162
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,700
Ah ahh...

163
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:48,300
- To the dead!
- To the dead!

164
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,400
Ok. Guys, let's play tell the truth.
Question.

165
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:59,300
If you could kill anyone and get away with it,
who would you kill?

166
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:02,200
The guy who invented condoms.

167
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,800
Fuck that guy.

168
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,400
- Griffin.
- I don't know.

169
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,100
C'mon it's an easy quesiton, Griff.

170
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:14,100
- You maybe.
- Oh I'm sorry, did you want to fuck me that bad?

171
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,000
Just your skull.

172
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Trust me Dr. Cavenaugh,
it's not as good as it looks.

173
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,900
I am interested in what Dr. Gray has to say.

174
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,500
Yeah, c'mon Teddy.

175
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:37,500
You guys want the truth or something clever?

176
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:41,500
- The truth.
- Just something clever.

177
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:44,500
Truth is ya'll full of shit.

178
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,500
Well go on, elaborate.

179
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:51,800
I mean, who needs motif, who needs a reason to kill.

180
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,300
Just today, Jake, you opened a 16 year old boy

181
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:57,400
who was shot in the stomach
because somebody wanted his fucking Ipod.

182
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,700
What kind of reason is that?

183
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:04,900
We're animals. It's in our nature to kill.
Basic, simple.

184
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,400
You should've all figured that out by now.

185
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:11,500
And of course, if we were civilized or socialized,
we'll be seating around talking about it over a beer,

186
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,500
we don't actually do it.

187
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,700
But could we really get away with it?

188
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:21,700
To kill anyone? Anyone at all?

189
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:27,700
Would you kill anyone? Anyone at all?

190
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,700
Good show! Now that's a man after my own heart.

191
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:37,100
Griff, waddaya say we get some shots?

192
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:46,800
I wonder about you.

193
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,900
Quit flirting with Teddy, we have to go soon.

194
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:54,000
Go play with the boys.

195
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,000
So, where're you from?

196
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Where am I from?
Maybe we should just get past that.

197
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,100
Ok.

198
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:15,600
Drink up. We're outta here.

199
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,800
Where're we goin?

200
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,400
Oh no, not we.

201
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,700
- We. You can take a cab.
- Cool.

202
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,700
I'm sorry man.

203
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:40,800
Aww, don't be hurt.
Have another beer.

204
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:47,200
Tomorrow night, just you and me.

205
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,700
Oh yeah? Doing what?

206
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:52,100
Nothing too exciting.

207
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:01,500
- W..Watch out!
- Whoaa!

208
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:05,600
- What the f...?
- That guy was in my fucking lane.

209
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,500
Hello!
It's dead.

210
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:14,300
C'mon, I want you to see something.

211
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:21,500
- Fuck!
- Shhh...

212
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,600
How many?

213
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:38,200
How many do you see?

214
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,800
- One fitty.
- Fitty?

215
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,400
One fitty!

216
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:55,300
Look bro, here's 80 bucks.
Last in to walk and talk.

217
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,400
Watch your step!

218
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,700
Hey, how's the herb?

219
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,500
You nervous?

220
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,700
No, but I think it's staying in my pants.

221
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:33,300
You sure about that?

222
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,400
Hey sport!

223
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,100
Shit!

224
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,600
Is this for real?

225
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,600
Hey sexy!

226
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,300
Fuck!

227
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:52,200
This is an illustration Dr. Gray
of why I hate doing it.

228
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:57,000
- This is fucked up man.
- Yeah, you think?

229
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,800
Ok, get me the fuck outta here!

230
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,800
- You sure? I mean we're already paid up.

231
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,200
Ok, let's go!

232
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,300
I want you all to work closely
with me on this one.

233
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,200
Sorry.

234
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:34,400
You smell like a liquor cabinet.

235
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,100
Doctor Bentwood, will you do the honour?

236
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,500
Harper Johnson, 40.

237
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:44,500
Convicted murderer, recently paroled,
subject was found...

238
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,600
One fitty!

239
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,300
I have to go out.

240
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:58,300
Forget to use the little boy's room, Dr. Gray?

241
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,700
All the blood tests are negative.

242
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:33,700
Alright, we have four scenarios running.
We have to narrow this down.

243
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,300
You want to present first?

244
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,500
Sure!

245
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:42,500
Simple assignment.
The subject was stabbed, excessively.

246
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:46,800
A minor struggle ensued, and he was shot
at the back of the head.

247
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,500
Cause of the death,
a gunshot wound to the brain.

248
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:55,400
The lack of blood from the head and the gradations of color
from the toraxic cavity of the neck, would tell us otherwise.

249
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:59,500
He would've lost too much blood to live
by the time he was shot in the head.

250
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,800
I think it was a mark, like a gang sign.

251
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:06,100
They probably watched him die
and then shot him.

252
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,900
Exsanguination via stab wounds.

253
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:11,600
Alright, let's discuss the trauma
on the left side of the head.

254
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,100
Any information of the meninges?

255
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:16,100
It's a domino effect in a trauma
of a gunshot wound.

256
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:18,900
I don't think so.

257
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:23,200
You wouldn't find any information
after a fatal wound like this.

258
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,200
The subject was obviously struck in the head
on the left side with a bat or kick

259
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,600
or one hell of a hard punch.

260
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:34,200
Look, there's a left epidural hematoma which caused injury
to the right temporal lobe from shifting in the skull.

261
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:38,500
This could've happened in the original confrontation.

262
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:42,500
What concerns me more, is this discoloration.

263
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,600
Well the blood tests did negative.

264
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,300
Well, a solution of potassium cyanide,
will leave no trace in the blood

265
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:51,300
or organ tissue sample detectable by standard tests.

266
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:55,500
Besides the stains on Harper's clothes were 70% plasma.

267
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:59,500
Most of the blood began coagulation
before exsanguination.

268
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,900
So whether he was moved or not...

269
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:05,900
majority of the blood remains in the body.

270
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,000
I say we run a post-mortem Chem-7 on his major organs

271
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,700
to evaluate his potassium levels.

272
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,200
You really think he was poisoned?

273
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:19,500
Six to seven hours before cuts were made to his body
the gunshot, followed shortly after.

274
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:24,500
You know there was actually gunpowder in the stab wounds.
Didn't anyone else notice?

275
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,500
I agree with Ted.

276
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:31,200
Signs of livor mortis, algor mortis, rigor mortis,
in the percede external wounds.

277
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:36,500
It's possible that the poison was injected directly
into the heart, be it the left axle or subscapular regions

278
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:43,100
or the lungs, be it the intercostal spaces...
enabling the killer to use less of a solution.

279
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:49,200
This will allow it to go undetected while
still getting the job done.

280
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,700
Lemme get this straight...
Are you proposing

281
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:56,000
that the man was poisoned with
potassium cyanide

282
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
then the killer waited 7 hours,
stabbed him 18 times

283
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,500
and then shot him in the back of the head?

284
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:07,200
- I realise this is highly improbable.
- That's an understatement.

285
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:12,600
However, we will explore it.
I will order Chem-7 and we will re-convene.

286
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:16,000
Ladies, gentlemen.

287
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,400
Nicely done. Might be onto something here.

288
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,400
Hey, meet me here tonight, 9pm.

289
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:26,700
You truly have a gift Ted.

290
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:34,500
Wh..What? You gonna bum-poke me?

291
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:05,100
- Let's go.
- You're late.

292
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,800
This's where you bring all your dates?

293
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:47,800
Now this wing is over a 100 years old. Obsolete.
If I'd, I'll tear it out and re-built it someday.

294
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:20,700
So, impress me.

295
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
You killed him.

296
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,800
Maybe.

297
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,500
The point is, how?

298
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,100
That is this? A game?

299
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:33,000
Exactly!
It's a game.

300
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,200
I don't fucking believe this.

301
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,000
- C'mon get over it, will you.
- Get over it?

302
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,800
There are 6.5 million people
in this city, Ted, trust me

303
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,100
this asshole will not be missed.

304
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,000
Really?

305
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,200
You can't say he didn't have it coming.
Right?

306
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:53,300
Yeah, he was not exactly a boy scout.
Is that what you want me to say?

307
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:58,900
Not exactly a boy scout Ted,
he was irredeemable filth.

308
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:02,400
That was his grandmother, by the way.

309
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:09,100
But really, who needs a reason.

310
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:17,700
We're animals. It's our nature to kill.

311
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,600
Remember?

312
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:25,100
Why show me this?

313
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,300
I don't know, Ted.

314
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:31,100
I thought the intellectual challenge
might be of interest to you.

315
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:35,100
- Was I wrong?
- No. No, I find it extremely fucking interesting.

316
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:38,600
Good. So, what's your theory?

317
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,700
I stay to my case.

318
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,900
Potassium Cyanide?

319
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:46,900
What are you? Some kind of serial killer?

320
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,000
Oh...

321
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:54,300
I obviously misjudged you.

322
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,000
Maybe you should just

323
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
run along home before the others get here.

324
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,400
The others?

325
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:09,400
Seriously man, get the fuck outta here.

326
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:32,500
- Yes?
- How do you know I won't tell?

327
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:35,500
Because there so happens to exist,

328
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:40,100
distinct physical evidence putting you
at the crime scene at the time of death.

329
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,000
I know because I placed it there.

330
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:49,000
And if I was amind to it I could prove with mathematical certainty
and beyond reasonable doubt that you were the one that did it.

331
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,100
But none of that really matters if
you're the boy I think you are.

332
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:58,400
You won't tell because
that would mean the game is over.

333
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:02,800
And you never got to play.

334
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:15,500
I don't know if you've heard but we got
the results back on our black male. Negative.

335
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,500
I heard. I'm sorry sir.

336
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:20,300
No, no, no, priviledged from time to time.

337
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:24,500
- Interesting theory.
- Thank you.
- Well, carry on.

338
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,500
Teddy!

339
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,800
What're you doin here?

340
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:43,600
It wasn't potassium cyanide because there was no ragged stippling
in the red blood cells. The blood was hypo or smaller.

341
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:46,400
It was nitric acid.

342
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,900
You brought him a bottle. A gift.

343
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,600
You shared a drink with him,
but you didn't drink.

344
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:54,500
You mixed athenol and nitric acid with the alcohol.
Probably a flavor to alcohol

345
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:57,500
to mask the bitter taste.

346
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:02,700
Using a needle would've been too dangerous because any first
year fucking med student would know to look for the mark.

347
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:06,400
You cut him up when he was still alive
but unconscious.

348
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,100
So there was no struggle.

349
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,700
Then you put him in the back of your truck,
drove him to fourth avenue

350
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:14,200
and shot him in the back of the head.

351
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:21,800
Mother fucker. Ah, you are good.

352
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:28,300
Hey, you wanna play the game, you gotta bring
something to the table. Comprendo?

353
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,400
So Jake told you about the game?

354
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:27,700
It's alright, you can say it.

355
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,600
So, are you in?

356
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,700
I don't know.

357
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,600
- You know what you have to do, right?
- Yeah.

358
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,700
I get the idea.

359
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,500
It's an interesting case.

360
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:19,500
You know it's always me that ends up with the dirt.
It's a waste of a goddamn ICU.

361
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:26,300
Mother fucker shoots his wife
and two kids, execution style

362
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,300
then he shoots himself in the throat

363
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:31,500
two more in the stomach and
he still couldn't get it done.

364
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:35,700
Double his morphine.
I'll check back in a couple of days.

365
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:41,600
- He's strapped in.
- Lot of pain.

366
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:48,200
He tried to pull out his wires.
He see devil soon I think.

367
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:09,000
- Oh my God, stop the bus. We need a doctor.
- Someone call 911.

368
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,300
- Is anybody a doctor?
- Is she breathing?

369
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:35,600
- Teddy?
- Hey baby.
- You alright?

370
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,900
Yeah, I'm great. I'm good.

371
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:44,900
- I got your message.
- You sounded like someone else.

372
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:49,300
Anyway, do you miss me?

373
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:51,600
Of course.

374
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:56,200
How's the work load goin?

375
00:34:56,200 --> 00:35:00,200
Actually that's one of the things
I wanted to talk to you about.

376
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:04,000
- It looks like next weekend...
- You're fucked?

377
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
I'm sorry. There's this mob trial and...

378
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,300
I understand.

379
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:14,300
Don't be rational, I'm gonna start crying
right here in the middle of the street.

380
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:19,600
Baby, to be honest, I have expected it.

381
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:29,500
Atleast there's Thanksgiving.

382
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:32,700
Absolutely.

383
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:37,200
My parents are still expecting
us to stay with them.

384
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,300
Of course.

385
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:44,900
Are you sure it's alright?
Because it's not too late to change your mind.

386
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,800
It's too late.

387
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,700
How so?

388
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,300
Yeah, no...

389
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:02,000
your parents are great.
It's beautiful there.

390
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,700
We're gonna have the back house
to ourselves, right?

391
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,700
That's true.

392
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:16,800
- Then it's settled.
- Ok then. I can't wait.

393
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:24,200
I'll call you tomorrow.

394
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,800
I love you.

395
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,100
You too.

396
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,100
I know exactly what you're thinking.

397
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:43,100
You think you feel guilty but it's not that.
There's not such thing as guilt.

398
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:46,400
There's just the fear of getting caught.

399
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:50,900
It's the first day after,
so that fear's still fresh.

400
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:55,600
Your brain is all sick and twisted up.
You're paranoid everyone knows.

401
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:59,600
You fucked up, you're gonna lose everything.

402
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:04,300
You wanna throw-up but
there's nothing in your stomach.

403
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:08,300
You're not gonna sleep tonight.

404
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:15,500
You'll hit the bottom, you'll watch some TV, and look for
any news that they're on you, but there won't be any.

405
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:23,400
Tomorrow morning, you're gonna wake up and it's gonna
be the same world. Nothing has changed.

406
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:27,200
That fear, it will start to creep away and after a few days

407
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:30,600
you're gonna realise no one knows shit.

408
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:34,600
That this whole bloody thing,
disadvantage to you, so cataclysmic

409
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,400
has somehow

410
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,700
slipped beneath the notice of the world.

411
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:41,300
And then...

412
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:44,600
you'll be a new man.

413
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,800
That sheet

414
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:06,500
on which she embroiled fantails once

415
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:10,500
spread it so as to cover her face

416
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,000
If her horny feet protrude,
they come to show how cold she is

417
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,800
and dumb.

418
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:21,400
Let the lamp affix its beam.

419
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:25,400
The only emperor, is the emperor of ice-cream.

420
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,900
How did you do it?

421
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:32,400
Later.

422
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:05,000
Welcome.

423
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,200
I knew you had it in you.

424
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,400
Had what in me?

425
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,000
C'mon, he was gonna die anyway.

426
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,700
Yeah, we're all gonna die anyway.

427
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:42,700
Fuck you!

428
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,600
So who is he?

429
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:19,500
Sort of this great man once. He never might know. He built
'em saved up from nothing. At one point he owned seven stores.

430
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:26,600
He married his highschool sweetheart.
Started a family.

431
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:30,400
Didn't last long though.

432
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:34,500
She left him, took the kids.
His business ran down,

433
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:37,800
he pissed away most of his money.

434
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,100
Why did she leave?

435
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:43,800
- The highschool sweetheart?
- Yeah.

436
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:49,700
I forgot to mention, he likes little girls.

437
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:55,400
In the worse way.
You wouldn't believe what he does to them.

438
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:04,500
He should've gone to jail but

439
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:09,000
you know how it goes, right?
It's easier for everyone to say nothing.

440
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,000
How do you know all this?

441
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:17,600
Because you never forget your first fuck.

442
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:22,900
He's my father.

443
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:33,900
I want you to help me.

444
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:39,200
Because it's my turn for the game.

445
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:45,800
- Doesn't seem like your type.
- No?

446
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:49,400
Clearly not like the usual lost cause
from the tournament award.

447
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:53,400
Oh he may had a few issues with
alcohol and tobacco.

448
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,900
Don't we all.

449
00:42:54,900 --> 00:43:00,500
But for the most part, he seems to have been in
relatively good health for a man of his age.

450
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,900
That is until you came along.

451
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:06,900
Could you be anymore hot right now?

452
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,700
I wonder what came over you?

453
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:13,100
It's as if he dropped his lungs
off the side of a building.

454
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:15,700
Yet the rest of his organs are pristine.

455
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:18,500
Donor material.

456
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:21,000
- No signs of asphyxia.
- He didn't asphyxiate.

457
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,700
How can you be so sure?

458
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:30,000
Because I know what asphyxiation looks like, dummy!
And it don't turn your lungs to jelly.

459
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,100
No.

460
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:35,100
I was thinking more along the lines of frostbite.

461
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:36,900
You're kidding.

462
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:40,900
The epidermis is healthy,
save for a few batches of sun damage.

463
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:44,900
Are you suggesting that Juliette
locked him in a freezer?

464
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:46,200
Because, I do not see it.

465
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:50,200
You don't?
Well, I see it all quite clearly.

466
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:53,100
This is some kind of bud baby.

467
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:57,400
This is really medical marijuana for free?

468
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:00,600
Well, I am in favor.

469
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:06,400
It's been proven to naturally alleviate pain.

470
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,500
Why should anyone have to suffer, right daddy?

471
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:12,100
Ain't that the truth.

472
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:14,600
That's your boyfriend huh?

473
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:26,600
What was it you said you was again?

474
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:29,300
A General Practitioner.

475
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:33,300
So you can prescribe this shit for me, legal?

476
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:37,800
Yeah, that's right.
Legal, beagle.

477
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:42,500
Where do I sign?

478
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:50,600
- No, let's do some whippets first.
- No shit!

479
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:56,800
You got a prescription for that too?

480
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:59,900
Who's first?

481
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,500
Thank you.

482
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Med school has its perks huh?

483
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:45,000
Liquid Nitrogen.

484
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:49,000
A mixture of chlorofluoro carbons,
nitrogen and a bit of free on my boy.

485
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:53,100
He died of anoxia.

486
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:56,200
It wasn't just that he couldn't breathe,

487
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:59,900
he couldn't adsorb the oxygen.

488
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:48,400
More challenging mystery is
how Miss Bath here

489
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,400
forced a 340 pound man

490
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:54,400
to ingest a canister of -75 degree air

491
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:55,600
all by herself.

492
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:59,300
She is a very charming girl.

493
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:02,400
That's true.
She could convince almost anyone

494
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:05,800
to do what she wanted them to.

495
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:10,800
You know, one could almost see a
resemblance between the two of you.

496
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:16,000
But maybe that's just the temperature.

497
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:37,400
Question.

498
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:39,400
Are you playing fair?

499
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:42,400
Is there such a thing?

500
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:43,800
No.

501
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:47,500
But don't you wanna know who's the best?

502
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:50,200
Aren't you a bit curious?

503
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:53,200
- That was pretty good last night.
- No idea what you're talking about.

504
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:54,900
Oh c'mon.

505
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,400
You don't expect me to believe that

506
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:59,700
our little Juliette,
came up with that one on her own, do you?

507
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:01,100
I've seen her work.

508
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,300
Oh no, maybe there's more to her
than you thought.

509
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:06,800
Mmm... No, I don't think so.
But maybe there's more to you.

510
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:07,700
Me?

511
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:10,900
I'm an open book, Jake.

512
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:15,200
Priceless.

513
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,900
I'll catch you later, Dr. Gray.

514
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:19,800
Oh Teddy?

515
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:22,400
She didn't give you that whole routine

516
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:27,000
about how her father raped her
when she was a little lass, did she?

517
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:29,700
Oh... what an imagination.

518
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:32,500
No, her father is alive and well.

519
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:35,100
Paid a visit just last month in fact.

520
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:39,200
Chairman of an obscenely profitable
banking institution.

521
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:42,300
And a hell of a guy I might add.

522
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:44,700
A hell of a guy.

523
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,600
Hey...

524
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:57,800
Who was he?

525
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:01,200
Who was he?!

526
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:04,400
Anyone.

527
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,900
Don't fuck with me.

528
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:15,600
Doctors?

529
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:19,700
Let's have a look inside.

530
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,500
Cyanide Pill.

531
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:32,200
I love that band.

532
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:48,300
Thanks so much.

533
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:49,500
Thank you.

534
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:53,200
You want a smoke?

535
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:58,700
As he inhales, he'd activates the vapors.

536
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:01,800
Ohh, genius!

537
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:04,400
It was genius!

538
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:34,400
You've been doing alot of urine work lately.
Good work.

539
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:00,700
My bad.

540
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:03,700
You switched his blood.

541
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:05,700
You found another patient

542
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:08,400
with an S.H.N.
Then you switched his blood to John Doe.

543
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,900
Am I right?

544
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:14,500
Fuck you!

545
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,300
Dr. Gray?

546
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:17,900
Sir.

547
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Is there anything that you would
like to share with me?

548
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:33,600
I'm sorry. I don't quite follow, sir.

549
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:35,400
No doubt.

550
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:39,100
Look, your work has been beyond
reproach exemplary.

551
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:41,600
- But what concerns me...
- Thank you, sir.

552
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:45,700
What concerns me is your
extracurricular life.

553
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:47,300
I'm sorry?

554
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:48,900
C'mon!

555
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,800
It is obvious that you are using.

556
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:53,400
One can experiment from time to time,

557
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:58,200
I mean, God knows I have done my share.

558
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:01,600
You should know that I planned on
giving you my highest recommendation.

559
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:04,100
I appreciate it, sir.

560
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:06,000
No doubt.

561
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,900
What're gonna be doing for the holidays?

562
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,400
Actually I plan on spending it with
Gwen's family.

563
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:14,400
That's good.

564
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:17,100
Opportunity to re-think your priorities.

565
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:18,900
Yes, sir.

566
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,200
And a little time away from Dr. Gallo
wouldn't hurt either.

567
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:24,900
No, it wouldn't.

568
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,700
Look...

569
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:35,400
I know you got it all worked out.

570
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:38,000
The money, the family with means,

571
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,600
pussy...

572
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:43,700
It would really be a shame if
you fucked it up.

573
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:49,600
Sir.

574
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:54,500
What's up with Morris?

575
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:56,900
Lonely.

576
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:04,200
C'mon, let's get the fuck outta here
and get a beer. C'mon.

577
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:20,700
- Hey, it's me. How are you?
- Hello.

578
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:22,800
Oh Jesus!

579
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:26,800
- What're you doing here?
- Are you going somewhere?

580
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:29,900
I told you. I'm leaving town for the holiday.

581
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:31,800
Right.

582
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:33,400
The fiancée.

583
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:35,700
So you're going through with that?

584
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:37,800
Why wouldn't I?

585
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:41,800
What about you and Jake?
Don't you have some sort of arrangement?

586
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:45,600
Nobody owns anybody.

587
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:15,800
- Hey.
- Hi. How are you?

588
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:22,900
- You missed me.
- Of course. How could I go on s'long without you.

589
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:26,000
Look at you.

590
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:28,500
Baby, you're working too hard.

591
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:29,600
Oh I'm ok.

592
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:32,700
Everything's ok now.

593
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:45,900
So?

594
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,900
I hear you're kicking ass
with the residency.

595
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:50,800
It has been an experience.

596
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:52,700
Quentin Morris is a good man.

597
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:54,500
I never liked that fruitcake.

598
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:55,800
He speaks pretty highly of you.

599
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:59,100
Of course. Why wouldn't he?

600
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:04,200
Look Ted. Bottom line, this program is the right thing
for you right now. Let's me sell you to the brass.

601
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:06,700
Working for Acxicom D.C.

602
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:09,500
it's as good as it gets.

603
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:12,000
Listen Ted.

604
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:16,100
This job withstand, whether you
and I liked it or not

605
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:20,200
- is what you have it.
- Thank you.

606
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:23,500
So what about Africa?

607
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:26,000
- Enjoy hunting yet?
- Hunting?

608
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:28,600
I would say hunting is alot better than the city.

609
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:31,700
Attaboy, I think.

610
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:33,400
- Daddy.
- Hey honey.

611
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:37,600
- I'm stealing my fiancée back now.
- Uh oh.

612
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:21,600
So I have an early Christmas
present for you.

613
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:24,600
Hey, can you just get it?

614
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:26,200
No.

615
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:28,700
It's better.

616
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:31,100
Impossible.

617
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:34,700
I'm gonna come back with you.

618
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:38,600
Not in two months from now.
But now.

619
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:45,500
I finished all my work and
I can fly back up to take the bar exam.

620
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:53,400
Hey, only if it's ok with you?

621
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,000
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

622
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:04,200
Sounds incredible.

623
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,300
You don't mind?

624
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:33,700
Wow look at this place.

625
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:38,200
I didn't know you were coming or
I would've cleaned up a bit.

626
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:41,500
Baby, it's perfect.

627
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:55,400
Hey, so what're you gonna wear tonight?

628
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:01,000
Gwen?

629
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:07,500
What the fuck is this?

630
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:09,500
Don't freak out.

631
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:12,100
I holding it for someone.
A resident.

632
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:14,600
He's trying to kick it.
I'm helping him out.

633
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:18,400
- A resident?
- Baby, do I look like a twigger to you?

634
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:22,700
- Why don't you throw it away?
- Because I ran out here in a flash to see you.

635
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:26,800
If you need help

636
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:30,400
now is the time to ask for it.

637
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:34,200
I'm sorry you had to see this.

638
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:37,300
That is not mine.

639
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:43,700
- Look.
- I love you.

640
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:46,700
I love you too.
Look... Hey, look at me.

641
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:52,600
I know that this is not the world
that we're used to, ok.

642
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:58,300
If we're gonna to that party,
we should probably get ready.

643
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:27,800
- Ben.
- Hey, how are ya?

644
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:31,900
- I want to introduce you to my fiancée, Gwen.
- Wow, the one and only huh.

645
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:35,200
Well it's a pleasure. Yeah, I've been hearing
all about you from day one.

646
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:39,600
Oh well, you too. It's nice to meet you, Ben.

647
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:42,900
- He's great huh?
- Yeah, he's a cute one.

648
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:44,500
- Oh, this is Donnna.
- Hi!

649
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:48,100
- Hi, Donna. Oh I love your dress.
- Thank you.

650
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:49,300
Oh look at this.

651
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:51,800
The prodigal son returns.

652
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:54,400
Ok, ok, we can go now.
It's ok.

653
01:00:54,400 --> 01:01:00,800
Stravinsky.
Stravinsky, you little turd.

654
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:04,000
Gwen, I'd like you to meet some
fellow residents of mine.

655
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:07,900
This is Dr. Jake Gallo and
Dr. Juliette Bath. Gwen Williamson.

656
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:09,600
- Hi!
- Hi!

657
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:13,500
Has Ted told you about all
the people he's killed?

658
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:16,600
Yes. I hear he cuts 'em up quite well.

659
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:19,400
- Well, he's learning.
- Yes, he's learning.

660
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:23,400
Practice makes perfect.
The wonderful thing about the death business

661
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:28,000
- Never shortage of cliental?
- Yes Gwen, exactly. Exactly.

662
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:31,800
Blessful immunity from the sicklecal,
economic avenflow.

663
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:33,300
You know, people just keep dying
and dying.

664
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:38,400
You mind if I straighten this a little tighter?
I cant...

665
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,400
Are you a school teacher?

666
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:43,200
Eh, no, I'm doing my bar exams in February.

667
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:46,400
Wow that's impressive.

668
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:49,300
You haven't killed any lawyers yet,
have you Ted?

669
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:52,600
Well, there's still so many.
It's hard to keep track.

670
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:55,800
You know, I might've ended up a lawyer
if I hadn't passed my M-CATs.

671
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:59,600
Oh that's too bad.
We might've been room-mates.

672
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:02,400
Oh if you'll excuse us,
Dr. Morris would wanna see Gwen.

673
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:05,200
Oh yeah. You two have a great time.
I mean this is a party.

674
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:09,200
You two enjoy yourselves. We'll be at
the trough assembling our meat plates!

675
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,600
Sorry about that.

676
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:15,200
Was it him?

677
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:20,600
Very perceptive, counsellor.

678
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:26,200
- I love you.
- Love you too. C'mon.

679
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:32,400
Dr. Morris.

680
01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:34,800
- Hi!
- Hi!

681
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:37,400
Well, you look very sexual.

682
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:40,400
I mean alluring.

683
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:45,900
Are you fucking kidding me?
Huh?

684
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:55,300
- Don't fucking touch me.
- Oh what? Huh? You wanna fuck that guy?
You wanna fuck that guy? Go fuck that guy.

685
01:02:55,300 --> 01:02:56,400
Hey we got a fucking whore in the room!

686
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:59,400
Go fuck him.
Just remember your ass belongs to me.

687
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:01,400
You don't fucking own me.

688
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:04,600
Oh, I fucking do!

689
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,200
Fuck this!

690
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:30,900
Shit! I gotta take this.

691
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:32,600
Yeah?

692
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:39,200
What's goin on? Where're ya?
Ok, be right there.

693
01:03:43,700 --> 01:03:45,100
I gotta go.

694
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:46,700
It's him, isn't it?

695
01:03:46,700 --> 01:03:48,800
I'm sorry.

696
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:52,800
I know. Becareful.

697
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:11,600
Teddy-boy!

698
01:04:11,900 --> 01:04:14,000
Hello Jake.

699
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:26,200
Oh fuck!

700
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:30,400
Where're the others?

701
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:34,300
Those sick-pants! Fuck 'em!

702
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:36,200
What happened?

703
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:42,000
Eh, simple transaction Teddy. I paid my money.
I got my money's worth.

704
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,600
I got stabbed too.

705
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:47,200
Good thing you're a doctor.

706
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:50,200
- We gotta clean this up!
- Clean this up?

707
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:54,200
What? This? You wanna clean... like what?
Like this? Like this?

708
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:58,500
You're losing it, Dr. Gallo.

709
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:04,500
Losing it? Teddy!

710
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:08,600
Teddy, I just fucking found it!

711
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:16,200
This is it.
This... this is it.

712
01:05:16,700 --> 01:05:18,600
Uh oh, who's that?

713
01:05:18,700 --> 01:05:24,700
That's you. That's me. That's me.
Me. You. Me. You. Me. You're me.

714
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:28,800
You're fucking killer.

715
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:31,600
You're fucking enemy.

716
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:40,400
Huh?
You fucking, fucking golden boy.

717
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:43,700
Playing ramsey with your
fucking eye-pleat cunt!

718
01:05:43,700 --> 01:05:46,100
She doesn't know you!

719
01:05:46,100 --> 01:05:48,200
I know you.

720
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:51,100
What about the game?

721
01:05:54,100 --> 01:05:55,400
What about it?

722
01:05:55,500 --> 01:06:00,300
Is that why you called me here?
C'mon, let's play.

723
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:07,200
This woman here...

724
01:06:10,100 --> 01:06:12,400
By the bubbles in her mouth,
I could see the subdued dire blood lost.

725
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:15,000
She died of suffocation.

726
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:19,100
Precisely.
She choked on her own blood.

727
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:29,800
So you pocked this one bloodygade in the
temple with that pipe right there?

728
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:33,200
- A near fatal aneurism?
- What?

729
01:06:33,300 --> 01:06:36,400
Of course you need to crack her head open
to know with mathematical certainty.

730
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:40,800
Ermm, waddaya mean near fatal?

731
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:45,900
You disemboweled...
Probably while she's still alive.

732
01:06:46,700 --> 01:06:48,400
There's blood on her right hand and
her wrist is broken.

733
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:52,400
So I guess I know who stabbed you,
probably while gutting.

734
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:05,200
Bravo!

735
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:11,000
I failed to see the genius here.

736
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:13,800
You failed to see?

737
01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:22,200
You failed to see?

738
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:32,800
Buzzkill.

739
01:07:36,100 --> 01:07:40,500
Let's go to the incinerator.

740
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:55,900
Hey!

741
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:01,900
What the fuck are you doing here?

742
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:03,600
'Coz I missed you.

743
01:08:03,700 --> 01:08:06,500
Do you know where I just was?

744
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:09,200
With Jake in the dungeon.

745
01:08:09,300 --> 01:08:11,800
He went ape-shit and thrill
killed three women.

746
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:15,000
I'm done with Jake.

747
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:17,400
I think you should leave.

748
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:20,600
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

749
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:27,400
Your fiancée was really beautiful.

750
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:31,100
You must be very happy.

751
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:55,000
This is taken directly from
the center of the seminiferus tubulus.

752
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,600
The mature sperm is showing
definite signs

753
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:00,400
of structural abnormalities.

754
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:03,900
Dr. Gallo?
You have a moment?

755
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:09,000
Certainly Dr. Gray.
Excuse me.

756
01:10:14,300 --> 01:10:16,500
I'm done. I'm out.

757
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:20,500
The words you're saying right now
are very dangerous.

758
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:22,800
You should probably be more careful.

759
01:10:22,900 --> 01:10:24,900
- Nobody gets out.
- Don't be so fucking dramatic, ok?

760
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,400
It's not like I can
say anything to anybody.

761
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:28,900
I'm up to my eyeballs in this shit.

762
01:10:28,900 --> 01:10:32,300
Yes you are, Ted.

763
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:36,400
- I've got my fiancée.
- Oh yeah, your fiancée. That's right. Gwen?

764
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:39,600
Hey, maybe she should come down some night.

765
01:10:39,700 --> 01:10:43,700
Hey, how about you don't mention her name again.

766
01:10:51,700 --> 01:10:55,300
I'm sorry. It's just...

767
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,400
You took me off guard last night.

768
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:03,500
- Yeah, that was some crazy shit huh?
- Yeah.

769
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:08,400
You good then?

770
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:15,600
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.
- Good.

771
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:25,000
Hey, ermm, we have a meeting tomorrow night.

772
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:28,200
- Tomorrow?
- Yeah.

773
01:11:28,300 --> 01:11:31,100
That's right. You busy?

774
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:35,200
Good 'coz you won't wanna miss this one.

775
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:44,100
So I need to take off for a few hours flat.

776
01:12:44,100 --> 01:12:45,900
I know but

777
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:48,100
I have to.

778
01:12:48,100 --> 01:12:54,400
- You don't have to.
- It'll be the last time, ok? I promise.

779
01:12:56,100 --> 01:13:02,900
- I believe you.
- You want one of these?

780
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,300
Here you are.

781
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:32,000
Whoa, we're contiguously short this evening.

782
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,300
She's with him.

783
01:13:35,300 --> 01:13:36,700
No.

784
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:38,800
I don't think so.

785
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:44,000
I think it's time we get
rid of that cocksucker.

786
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:47,300
- I concur.
- And her.

787
01:13:47,700 --> 01:13:50,000
Yeah. Fuck yes, and her.

788
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:55,200
Well, if we're all in agreement,
let the lamp affix its beam.

789
01:14:13,300 --> 01:14:17,300
- What the fuck.
- What the fuck?

790
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:29,600
Alright, let's do this.

791
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:36,000
Doctors, let's have a look inside.

792
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:46,600
Oh I get it.

793
01:15:52,700 --> 01:15:55,300
- What happened?
- Oh my God, you haven't heard?

794
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:56,600
Heard what?

795
01:15:56,700 --> 01:15:59,900
There was a fire here last night,
on the lower level.

796
01:15:59,900 --> 01:16:02,700
Some of our residents were killed.

797
01:16:02,700 --> 01:16:05,000
Who?

798
01:16:05,100 --> 01:16:08,000
Juliette Bath and Griffin Cavenaugh

799
01:16:08,100 --> 01:16:12,100
and there's two bodies yet to be identified.

800
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:16,300
Wait, you said two bodies?

801
01:16:16,300 --> 01:16:18,200
Unidentified.

802
01:16:18,300 --> 01:16:21,500
- Plus Julieth Bath. Plus Griffin Cavenaugh.
- Right. That's right.

803
01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:23,700
Then there were four.

804
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:26,000
Correct. Four.

805
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:30,800
- Look, I know that you're upset.
- Excuse me. I'm just gonna step outside.

806
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:47,800
Fuck!

807
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:20,500
Hi, you remember me from the party?

808
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:23,400
- It's Jake Gallo, isn't it?
- Yeah.

809
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:26,300
Um, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

810
01:17:26,300 --> 01:17:30,200
- Ted already left.
- I know.

811
01:19:13,900 --> 01:19:17,900
I just spoke to Inspector Vincent
from the homicide division.

812
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:22,200
He finds Jake Gallo's absence
to be quite suspicious.

813
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:27,100
He also asked me if there was anyone who 
might be able to offer any insight or clues

814
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:29,200
as to why one of my top doctors

815
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:32,400
would have committed such an atrocity.

816
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:34,400
I could think of no one.

817
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:37,100
Can you think of anyone doctor?

818
01:19:37,100 --> 01:19:40,600
Several names come to mind
but since they're all individuals

819
01:19:40,700 --> 01:19:42,400
who were killed in the fire

820
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:47,900
I suspect that questioning them
would prove fruitless.

821
01:19:49,300 --> 01:19:51,400
Concerning Gwendolyn.

822
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:54,900
I can't tell you how devastated I was
when I got the news,

823
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:59,000
compounding what is already a tragedy
for the hospital.

824
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:04,300
- I know that you loved her a great deal and I'm truly sorry.
- Thank you.

825
01:20:05,900 --> 01:20:10,600
As for the cause of her death, I haven't been able
to come up with a firm conclusion.

826
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:15,000
Based on my initial examination,
a full autopsy is gonna be necessary.

827
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,300
I'm doing it.

828
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:17,600
Excuse me?

829
01:20:17,700 --> 01:20:21,300
I don't want anyone else to touch her but me.

830
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:27,600
- You would have to get the parents' permission.
- I've already spoken to the Williamsons.
They gave me their full blessing.

831
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:29,800
- I vehemently disapprove.
- Dr. Morris.

832
01:20:29,900 --> 01:20:34,900
I urge you not to stand in the way of
the parents' wishes and my own.

833
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:40,500
Alright then. She's yours.

834
01:23:36,300 --> 01:23:40,300
- Dr. Gray, good night.
- Good night, David. Rajeeve.

835
01:24:13,300 --> 01:24:14,900
Well?

836
01:24:14,900 --> 01:24:16,400
Well?

837
01:24:16,500 --> 01:24:21,100
I read something wildly amusing today.
Thought I'd share.

838
01:24:21,300 --> 01:24:23,600
Patient Name: Gwendolyn Marie Williamson.

839
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:27,400
Age 28, eyes brown, blah blah blah blah blah.

840
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:29,500
Ahh haha!

841
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:32,400
Conducting pathologist determines
cause of the death to be due to

842
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:35,400
an arrhythmia of the heart!

843
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:40,000
A direct consequence of
mitral valve prolapse?

844
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:44,800
- That's great shit huh?
- That's right. What the fuck do you care?

845
01:24:45,100 --> 01:24:47,500
Because...

846
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:54,400
I have composed a poem sublime and you are my critic,
you are my only critic, Teddy.

847
01:24:54,500 --> 01:24:56,900
And have you read carefully 
your review of my work, 

848
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:01,500
my conclusion is that it sucks!
- Maybe it's just your clothes.

849
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:12,000
You know that this one was well above average.

850
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:16,000
This one was fucking meticulous.

851
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:23,500
Oh shit...

852
01:25:26,500 --> 01:25:28,900
She never really knew you, did she?

853
01:25:28,900 --> 01:25:30,900
- My fiancée?
- Yeah, her.

854
01:25:30,900 --> 01:25:32,400
Just the good side.

855
01:25:32,500 --> 01:25:35,300
No, I didn't think so.

856
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:40,700
And there you were... oh boy!
Good little soldier

857
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:42,400
ready to march down the aisle.

858
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:47,500
Fuck man. Fuck.
I did you a fucking favor huh?

859
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:50,500
You owe me.

860
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:52,900
By the way

861
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:54,900
Props to you for killing everyone.

862
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:56,800
Oh yeah, sorry about that.

863
01:25:56,900 --> 01:26:00,900
No, no, no, no, my bad.
I should've seen it coming.

864
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:05,400
It's in the past.
The important thing is, Teddy

865
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:09,200
That in the end... in the end

866
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:11,600
I won!

867
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:12,900
How so?

868
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:17,000
Because I did one that you couldn't figure out.

869
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:20,200
I win!

870
01:26:25,300 --> 01:26:26,900
You like that?

871
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:28,500
I don't think so.

872
01:26:30,500 --> 01:26:33,200
I think so.

873
01:26:33,400 --> 01:26:37,600
Mitral valve prolapse bullshit!

874
01:26:37,700 --> 01:26:41,700
It's what I told the parents
so that they won't freak out.

875
01:26:42,300 --> 01:26:43,800
Aha?

876
01:26:44,100 --> 01:26:47,300
- I actually do have a theory.
- You have a theory?

877
01:26:47,300 --> 01:26:51,900
Alright. Impress me.

878
01:26:52,900 --> 01:26:54,200
Gwen made a fatal mistake

879
01:26:54,300 --> 01:26:59,300
trying to get back on you and when she did,
you covered her mouth with any of your soaked cloth.

880
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:07,800
You were careful not to
let her lose consciousness though.

881
01:27:08,200 --> 01:27:09,600
After that

882
01:27:09,700 --> 01:27:13,700
you injected the potassium into the
basilica vein under her armpit

883
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:17,400
to help preserve the body

884
01:27:17,500 --> 01:27:21,300
before dripping nitroglycerin
on her tongue.

885
01:27:21,300 --> 01:27:26,800
And then, you slowly let her fade
into the after life.

886
01:27:31,500 --> 01:27:35,500
She took approximately 7 minutes,

887
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:41,500
about the same amount of time it takes
for an average person to fall asleep.

888
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:47,000
She could hear everything
that you said to her.

889
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:52,100
The last thing she saw on this earth

890
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:56,400
was your delightful face.

891
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:00,700
Time?

892
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:05,800
Six minutes, thirty seconds.

893
01:28:06,200 --> 01:28:08,400
29... 28...

894
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:12,600
Dr. Stravinsky?

895
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:18,000
Let's have a look inside.
