1
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,550
<i>They were pulling her out of
the river when I got there</i>

2
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,130
<i> more water than blood in her
at that point.</i>

3
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:17,160
Was she able to speak?
-No.

4
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:19,460
She stopped breathing

5
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,870
OK, that should be enough

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,070
Detective Aubrey, despite
some irregularities ...

7
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:33,410
with regards to proper
Police procedures,

8
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,340
We will not be proceeding
any further with our inquiry.

9
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:38,480
Six weeks have elasped ...

10
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:40,470
since the last Uncle Eddie murder.

11
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:44,790
And that itself suggest that
the public interest has been served

12
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:49,880
Congratulations on your promotion
to detective first grade.

13
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:04,690
<i> This afternoon
Detective Stan Aubrey,</i>

14
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:06,950
<i>lead investigator in
the Uncle Eddie's case ...</i>

15
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:13,180
<i> The death of primary suspect
in the Uncle Eddie murders ...</i>

16
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,590
<i> ended this morning.</i>

17
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:18,390
<i> ... these horrible murders.</i>

18
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,500
<i>The circumstances
surrounding the shooting ...</i>

19
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:23,160
<i> remain as yet unclear.</i>

20
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:26,260
<i> Linked by their gruesome art ...</i>

21
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:34,310
<i> while presenting the awards ...
as a model officer,</i>

22
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,480
<i> responsible for bringing one of
the city's</i>

23
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:38,720
<i> most disturbing case.</i>

24
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:39,890
Come on.

25
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,800
Wait, wait, wait.

26
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,030
Wait, my hat.
-Get up.

27
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,010
Hey, OK?

28
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,300
Don't be seduced.

29
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,890
Avoid psychological
speculation

30
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:33,990
related to the killer's intent

31
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,740
We may never know
why he did what he did.

32
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,450
He may never know.

33
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:53,350
Treat the boundaries of the
crime scene like a frame,

34
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:56,810
and limit your analysis to what
is presented within it.

35
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,760
Stick with it,
don't rush things,

36
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,470
and above all, in your initial
encounter with the crime scene,

37
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:04,170
trust your own eyes.

38
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:07,960
Remember, all you really have
is what the killer left behind

39
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,730
His work is pathetic,
if you will.

40
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:19,300
OK, we'll pick up
there next week.

41
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:39,670
Ninety three.

42
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:10,860
Yup

43
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:19,770
Well you better get him out out of here.
'Cos north of the lamp post is ours

44
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:22,860
Do us all a favour
and walk away from this one?

45
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:25,330
Walk away and take him

46
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:43,950
Gonna ask some of you questions.

47
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,380
We got a preliminary statement

48
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:48,780
Stan, don't recognize you.
How've you been?

49
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,920
Good, I'm good

50
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,230
Action is in there

51
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,180
Chew a little easier
on the protocol, eh pal?

52
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:57,720
Brainerd called me.

53
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,460
Brainerd called him, eh

54
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:01,480
Stan ...

55
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,840
You come in the morning, alright?

56
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,880
See, I'm getting promoted.
You and I going to be peers.

57
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,430
No.

58
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:16,160
I got to tell you I had a bad case of
deja vu, I didn't work the caper.

59
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,520
What caper?
-What caper?

60
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,600
The caper. Uncle Eddie.

61
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:25,240
Isn't that why Brainerd brought you in?

62
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,350
No, no, no, you're cold.

63
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:58,830
We held up turning it down
till you got here

64
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,930
Yes, it's the kind of smell like it
gets inside you, doesn't it?

65
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:06,920
Billy, video.

66
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:19,890
I call that a conversation piece.

67
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:32,020
It is a camera obscura.

68
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,590
A device used in
the Renaissance ...

69
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,460
to draw in perspective.

70
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:41,830
May I?

71
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:51,970
Hey, Hey! You want to hold off
on that until I mark the aperture?

72
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,600
The pinhole focuses the light.

73
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:06,330
You have that flashlight?
-Yah.

74
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,140
Take it down

75
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:02,140
I would love to get up there.

76
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:04,930
I do not know, man.
I could smell it down the hallway.

77
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:07,040
Did you see they called Stan Aubray in?

78
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,520
Nope. Hey, he's on one of my classes

79
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,680
I thought they retired him already

80
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,680
God ...

81
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,040
Wanna buy you breakfast.
-No, I'm going straight to bed.

82
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,710
I think I'm getting a cold.

83
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,190
OK.

84
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,480
What are you doing, Stan?

85
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,350
Worrying.

86
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,980
About what?
-Wearing the fabric.

87
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,350
That's what my mon used to say

88
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:39,430
is to touch things all the
time wear them down.

89
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:41,610
That's why you're good
at what you do.

90
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:45,290
You never mentioned your mother before.

91
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,710
She live in the city?

92
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,950
Staying sober?

93
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:59,550
Four years and three months.

94
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,140
You're gonna ask me that everytime?

95
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:09,080
Yes, it's certainly the best
place to get to know someone.

96
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:11,460
Or maybe that's the idea.

97
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,060
You probably you keep
a girl like me ...

98
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,760
at every donation center.

99
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:26,380
It's so weird to think of my blood
in someone else's body.

100
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:28,970
You know, if you'd run into me
a couple of months later, then you

101
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,680
thought wouln't be accepting
my blood right now.

102
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:34,720
No, you'd estrange yourself
out of it sooner or later.

103
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:37,470
Can I pick who it goes to?
-No.

104
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,940
It's my blood.

105
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,060
That is the trouble with transfusions.

106
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,830
You have to replace like with like.

107
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,810
It's not true.

108
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,040
If you are old
you can give to anybody.

109
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:58,120
You know Crystal was old.

110
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,180
When I used to see her
they had to be ...

111
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,250
because she'd give it up
for anybody.

112
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,440
She give it up for you?

113
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:06,900
Did she say something?

114
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:10,050
I don't know, between dates, yeah.

115
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:12,480
You have a lot of time
to get to know someone.

116
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:15,230
I knew things from it
that nobody else knew.

117
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,220
She had this birthmark ...

118
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,510
under his left arm.

119
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,140
She always used to say that no matter
how many guys she was with,

120
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,040
no man would ever find her

121
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,200
Think about it too

122
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,510
Sorry.

123
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:40,290
Let's go to somewhere
away from here.

124
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:42,030
Above ground, maybe

125
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,070
Like hiking

126
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,300
I'm going with some friends
this weekend.

127
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,670
You could come.

128
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:54,170
I'd love to
but I got to work.

129
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:57,970
Shocking.
-Another time.

130
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,630
Probably.

131
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:03,580
Probably not.

132
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,610
I got to go.

133
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,500
Looks like an egg.

134
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:27,290
Sometimes a circle
is just a circle, chief

135
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:30,530
Building management got back
to us this morning.

136
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:33,690
The hanging man was
identified as Martin Calderon.

137
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:36,480
Works as a day trader,
never left his apartment.

138
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:40,140
I thought that you might want to take
a look at the report Carl put together.

139
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,120
He was up all night.

140
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,220
It's a theory it was a ritual killing,

141
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:47,220
some kind of a copycat
imitating Uncle Eddie.

142
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,090
No, this is different.

143
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,510
It's less spontaneous.

144
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:58,340
It don't seem so different to me.

145
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:04,470
Look, hard as the Uncle Eddie case was

146
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,750
you're still a detective

147
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:12,490
I'd appreciate it if you'd give
this one your full attention.

148
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,130
I'll will

149
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,410
Thank you.

150
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,680
Based on decomposition of the body,

151
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,990
victim's been dead
at least a week.

152
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,310
Now, the cause of death.
-Hanging by your f ... ankles.

153
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:39,350
But he was probably dead
before he got that far ... yeah?

154
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:42,350
Yeah.
You see the sutured wound?

155
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,380
Intestines had been removed

156
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:50,390
The killer went to the trouble of ...
removing them

157
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:54,150
and closing the incision
before he strung him up.

158
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:59,330
I would have cleaned the body
completely but I want to show you ...

159
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:03,730
The blue is not just discoloration.

160
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:07,210
The body was painted
before the dust was applied.

161
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,280
It's all over him

162
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:12,660
I don't see it here.

163
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,300
Just the front of his body.

164
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:20,320
The side that faced
the aperture.

165
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:24,320
Like a stage set,
seen from one side.

166
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,460
What, the human slide show ...

167
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,320
wasn't kinky enough?

168
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,020
He had to paint the body?

169
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,540
Maybe trying to pretty him up.

170
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:00,820
Excuse me ...

171
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:03,060
Are you the owner?

172
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:04,270
Yeah

173
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:07,110
You can't put a painting like that
in the window

174
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,120
Why?

175
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:15,040
It is irresponsible.

176
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:20,320
I don't have to look at that
everytime I leave my apartment.

177
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,390
So, buy it and burn it.

178
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:26,820
Don't get fresh with me.
You take it down, right now.

179
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:29,250
How much is this?
-Fifty dollars.

180
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:32,530
Why not have more of those?
Pictures of butterflies.

181
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,410
When was the last time
you've seen a butterfly?

182
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:37,780
Where did you get this?
-I don't know, a state lot.

183
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,660
I may need to call you.
-You're a cop?

184
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,400
Its like its stolen?

185
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:45,670
Hey listen, I just
I found this out on the street,

186
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:46,840
right in front of my shop.

187
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,050
Thanks

188
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,720
Nice painting.
We analyzed the paint.

189
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,860
These aren't commercial pigments.

190
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:07,890
Pull samples
from this case number,

191
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:10,160
and have the lab
run a comparison.

192
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:13,430
There is something else.

193
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:15,810
We did an X-ray
to look for underpaint

194
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:18,070
This is pretty wild

195
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:25,600
Look like there was a bird
in the chair in the original image.

196
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,170
I wonder
why he painted over it.

197
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,420
Do you have anything to wrap this up?

198
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:33,740
I want to take it over there myself

199
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,340
You've been shopping, Stan?

200
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,070
"Mr. Aubrey, Let's talk"

201
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,810
"Alex"

202
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:06,800
Stan, I wanted to pick your
brain about the case.

203
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:10,070
What is this?
Paperweight?

204
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,860
I still need to sit down
over the pathology report.

205
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,880
No, no, no, I mean
the Uncle Eddie case.

206
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,240
Given the copycat angle ...

207
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,150
I though it was good idea
to look at your file.

208
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,350
You looked at my file?
-Yeah.

209
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,390
You don't mind, do you?

210
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:35,420
Hey Stan, why not you flip
through the unsolved case files?

211
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,880
Look to see if those guys
missed anything.

212
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:41,800
I know it is tedious right, but,
Who knows what you might see?

213
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,340
What is today?
-Tuesday.

214
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:51,860
No, the date.
-The Tenth. Why?

215
00:22:55,490 --> 00:23:00,980
Ok, this is what I've got.
Louis comf ..., 1745.

216
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,680
Nice.
-Yes.

217
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,190
Sixteenth century Ming

218
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,480
Rarity, Joseph Ubonn.

219
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:13,630
And an American Victorian

220
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:19,650
I do not know this is your style but ...
-What is that?

221
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:23,430
Oh that a girl
to go with your chair.

222
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,640
See I stumble upon
this invaluable collection ...

223
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,130
of Civil War porn.

224
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:33,480
I am not interested in pornography,
I need something functional,

225
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,100
something I can touch.

226
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,210
Okay, I was ready
to diversify.

227
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:40,560
But you hold on to those.
Tell me which one you want to pursue.

228
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:45,010
Oye, oye, not her.
She's mine.

229
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,330
Russ, another round.

230
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:49,590
Coming up.

231
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:55,160
Here is a painting
I wanted to see.

232
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:03,890
Sorry, Stan,
but this is joke.

233
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:07,410
And doesn't go with your chair.
-No, you don't understand.

234
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,330
It is a picture of
of the crime scene ...

235
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:10,980
I am working on.

236
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:15,150
It was in the window of the
antique store near my place.

237
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:18,300
I think the killer painted it.

238
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:21,660
Wow.

239
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:25,900
That would be quite a coincidence
I mean if you're right.

240
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,130
Come on, I mean anybody
could have done this.

241
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:33,370
It has been in the news
for the last couple of days ...

242
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:34,730

till I can collect my pension.

246

247

Hey, not too shaby.
-Yes.

248
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:02,060
The department really spared no
expense for your promotion.

249
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,600
It's beautiful, fellas.
-Yes.

250
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:06,460
You know my brother
got a f ... watch

251
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,620
Beer?
-No, thanks.

252
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:26,920

-Yes.

253
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:29,280
Cheers, Cheers.
-Cheers.

254
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,250
Great success.

255

256

257
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,610
Miss, Could I get
some milk?

258
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:09,600
Sure are a lot of cops here,
aren't there, Mr. Aubrey?

259
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:15,580
How do you know my name?
-Alex Fredericks.

260
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,220

some of my pieces ...

261
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,480

you down, I defended you

263
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,450
Turns out you and I were right.

264
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:34,910
We were?

265
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:40,400
Talk to me about the new case

266
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,360
Is it a copycat killer?

267
00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:45,620
You think he'll kill again?

268
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,470
Who do we call him?
Oh, will think of something snappy.

269
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:52,090
What do you want?

270
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,300
Why don't you walk away after
the Uncle Eddie murders?

271
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:02,760
It is sad
what happened to that girl.

in the same office ... about what
five years now?

290
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,940
I don't even know if you're married.

291

I don't even know

well, I don't give a shit

to piece this guy back together.

A Jeff Sarno.

303
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:08,240
Except the intestines.

304
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:11,360
They belong to Mr. Calderon.

305
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,750
We checked for evidence
of sexual assault, none.

306
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:18,470
Hey, Stan,
Nice you can make it.

307
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:20,810
What did I missed?
-Meet Jeff Sarno.

308
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:22,670
What else you got?

309
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,910
This might interest to
only to students of anatomy ...

310
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:27,890
and human behavior.

311
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:30,880
Victim had
extensive cosmetic surgery.

312
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,430
Apparently wasn't happy
with the top half of his mouth ...

313
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:37,120
so they split his his upper palate ...

314
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:40,790
and lengthened it to
match the lower jaw.

315
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:44,070
Pretty ironic, huh?

316
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:46,770
All that work and end up
chopped up like this.

317
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:48,550
Why would he go through
all that trouble?

318
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,470
Jeff Sarno was an actor.
Not a successful one.

319
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,980
Didn't you read the case file?

320
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:57,690
He had an audition.

321
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:00,560
According to his agent, the
director calls that the kid ...

322
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:02,320
had the right look for the part

323
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,750
We got an address or a phone
number for the appointment?

324
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:06,770
No. We checked
and came up with nothing

325
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:07,950
And the agent?

326
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:12,520
He just got a call saying that they
were ... going in a different direction.

327
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,790
Whatever that means.

328
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:16,290
When Sarno didn't call back

329
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:19,080
The agent figured the kid
buried his head in the sand

00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:28,390
<i> Detective Aubrey, let's pick up
where we left off last time.</i>

333
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,710
<i>We were talking about the moment
you found the girl.</i>

334
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:37,680
<i>They were pulling here out of the River
when I got there</i>

335
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:41,640
<i> She was wearing a fur coat
that had become big ...</i>

336
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,660
<i> and heavy with the water.</i>

337
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:50,780
<i> Was she able to speak?
-No.</i>

338
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:54,340
<i>She had multiple stab wounds
to the abdomen.</i>

339
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:57,690
<i> There was more water than blood
in her at that point.</i>

340
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:01,690
<i>I tried to use my hands
to stop the bleeding,</i>

341
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:06,180
<i>but she took
a big gasp of air ...</i>

342
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,850
<i> and looked right through me.</i>

343
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:13,050
<i> And then she stopped breathing.</i>

344
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:17,090
<i> He said you had met the victim before.</i>

345
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:21,330
<i>Did you ever intend to warn her
that she was in danger that night?</i>

346
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,690
It is one in the morning.

347
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:47,100
I'm sorry, I know it's late, but did
you hear any noises upstairs earlier?

348
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,480
Not only you just now.

349
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:51,950

350
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,750
No, didn't hear anything.

What you think?

352
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:54,930
White male, age 43, lives alone.

353
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:57,800
One case of corrupting a minor ...

354
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,670
brought by the DA's office
five years ago,

355
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:01,370
then later dismissed.

356
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:05,140
Drives a Lincoln, similar to the one
identified by witnesses ...

357
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:07,480
at three of the last
five murder scenes.

358
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:09,580
And we got prints
and blood type ...

359
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:11,440
based on saliva match

360
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,200
I think this is our guy.

361
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,830
I can have a warrant ready
in three hours.

362
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:49,450
Hey Stan!

363
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:02,660
Aubrey and Luiz, you take the back,
I'll go on the front.

364
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:04,680
Now wait on my signal.

365
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:28,480
Position.

366
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:33,850
Gun! Gun, gun!
Stop, don't shoot!

367
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,010
We got the bastard

368
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:46,010
It looked like a gun

369
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,700
Did the right thing.

370
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:36,280
I was going to meet you upstairs

371
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:38,220
I can't, I just got time
for my cigarette break.

372
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:40,890
We can go get a coffee.
-No, this is good.

373
00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:43,560
I really need a cigarette.
Mind if I smoke in here?

374
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:44,860
No, hop in.

375
00:43:51,610 --> 00:43:53,060
How you doing, man?

376
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:55,770
Thanks for returning my call.
-Not a problem.

377
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:57,590
We are buddies

378
00:43:57,930 --> 00:44:00,090
I heard that you are working
on a new case.

379
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:03,490
Yeah, they expect to be on something
so soon after that last one.

380
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:07,250
Last one?
Talking about five years ago.

381
00:44:08,590 --> 00:44:10,410
You got promoted didn't you?
-Yeah.

382
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:13,880
They got me up there
nice cushy desk job

383
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:15,830
Oh good.

384
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:19,870
Tough thing was that girl.
-The girl?

385
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:23,350
Could have been twenty more
girls like her dead, Stan.

386
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:25,850
Panned out in the end.

387
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,010
How is your family?

388
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:32,860
Everybody's good.
Boys are 8 and 10 now.

389
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:35,240
Big kids, man.

390
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:41,710
Look, It's great to see you, man.

391
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,220
Me too.

392
00:44:45,310 --> 00:44:46,930
Have something you want
to get off your chest?

393
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:49,110
No!

394
00:44:50,890 --> 00:44:56,740
I mean I'm on this thing and ...
I have been thinking.

395
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:02,850
You know, I think I know
what is going on here.

396
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:08,230
My advice to you is, if it's in
the past, let it stay there.

397
00:45:08,350 --> 00:45:09,650
Things change.

398
00:45:10,870 --> 00:45:13,020
Never set foot in the same river twice.

399
00:45:16,010 --> 00:45:18,070
Thanks.
-Sure.

400
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:20,650
I think you gonna catch this guy.

401
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:35,680
That one.

402
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:38,010
This is the one you want?
-Yes.

403
00:45:38,190 --> 00:45:40,340
What's wrong with the one
you've got, Stan?

404
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:44,030
Oh you know that I actually having
company over the year?

405
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,370
I just want another chair.

406
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:49,320
What's wrong with having
two matching chairs?

407
00:45:49,610 --> 00:45:52,480
Nothing wrong, Stan.
Nothing wrong.

408
00:45:53,410 --> 00:45:58,580
I get you a Federal salty table or
a Heppelwhite for the same price.

409
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:01,290
No, no, no, that's what I want.
-OK.

410
00:46:04,770 --> 00:46:06,260
What?

411
00:46:09,650 --> 00:46:11,630
You just have to have it, don't you?

412
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,500
That's your problem, Stan.

413
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:20,760
Me, I love the feel of an object
changing hands, to let it go.

414
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,550
You can't let go of
anything, can you?

415
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:26,460
Like that girl,
the memory of the girl.

416
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:30,300
Might not be your fault.

417
00:46:31,710 --> 00:46:36,400
Might just be the past
that isn't through with you yet.

418
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,870
Keeps pulling you back
all the time.

419
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:41,940
Now all of a sudden
it's a copycat killer.

420
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:44,320
We do not know if it is a copycat.

421
00:46:44,450 --> 00:46:46,390
I'm not so sure either, Stan.

422
00:46:46,590 --> 00:46:49,780
I took a look at some photos
from the Uncle Eddie killings,

423
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:53,040
and I kept thinking about
your painting ... and

424
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:55,200
He said it was a piece of junk.

425
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:57,420
There was something there though.

426
00:46:57,550 --> 00:47:02,110
The presentation of the body,
the pigments and gestalt.

427
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,370
There was something about it,
You know what I mean?

428
00:47:04,410 --> 00:47:07,010
No, I don't know what you mean.

429
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:10,440
Looking at the work
in a sequence,

430
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:13,270
was like watching
a retrospective.

431
00:47:20,990 --> 00:47:23,450
I think you should stick
to garage sales ...

432
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:25,160
and vintage porn.

433
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:27,630
Don't get your horns all twisted.

434
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:30,130
We killed Uncle Eddie.

435
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:34,660
You're dealing with the same guy.

436
00:47:39,470 --> 00:47:41,620
I'm tired of your bullshit.
-Stan, sit down, Stan.

437
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:43,720
No, I'm leaving.
-Come on, sit down, Stan.

438
00:47:43,890 --> 00:47:45,240
I'm leaving.

439
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:53,650
Sorry.

440
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:56,000
I'm sorry.

441
00:51:25,670 --> 00:51:27,100
Stan.

442
00:51:31,410 --> 00:51:32,710
Thanks

443
00:51:33,150 --> 00:51:34,570
Eggs Florentine.

444
00:52:03,590 --> 00:52:06,550
Is it true that there is a connection
with the murders of Uncle Eddie?

445
00:52:08,870 --> 00:52:11,170
What about connections to Uncle Eddie?
Is it a copycat?

446
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:14,250
Come on, give us something.
-When I say stop, you stop.

447
00:52:14,770 --> 00:52:17,280
There is no copycat,
got nothing to do with Uncle Eddie.

448
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:18,740
Leave it alone.

449
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:21,280
I heard the victim worked
Uncle Eddie cases with you.

450
00:52:23,290 --> 00:52:24,320
You got to give me something.

451
00:52:24,450 --> 00:52:27,640
I can't always have information ...
-Get her out of here!

452
00:52:28,330 --> 00:52:29,580
Hold on here, miss.

453
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:35,160
Who leaked this to the press?

454
00:52:37,390 --> 00:52:39,210
Hard to keep a lid on
a story like this.

455
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:40,640
You know that, Stan.

456
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:46,900
This guy really
a buddy of yours?

457
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:49,650
Work colleague

458
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:53,810
Make me lie for you, Stan.

459
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:08,260
Used your friend
like an inkwell.

460
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:39,950
What's this one about, Picasso?
What's the connection?

461
00:57:23,870 --> 00:57:26,020
Guy is writing a love letter, Stan.

462
00:57:44,970 --> 00:57:45,990
Stan ...

463
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:48,650
Just take a minute.

464
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:51,650
I wasn't sure whether
I should come down here ...

465
00:57:51,770 --> 00:57:54,150
so I talked it over with my wife.

466
00:57:54,550 --> 00:57:57,340
She works a hotline
as a crisis counselor.

467
00:57:59,650 --> 00:58:03,160
She told me that the only way to
avoid a crisis is to anticipate one.

468
00:58:04,580 --> 00:58:06,280
Has seen this morning paper?

469
00:58:07,330 --> 00:58:09,160
Your past is starting
to give me nightmares.

470
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:10,130
Camera Killer
Leaves a Mess

471
00:58:10,250 --> 00:58:12,600
Which version of my past do
you mean?

472
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:15,800
Your old partner,
George, is dead.

473
00:58:16,730 --> 00:58:18,900
Now why is that?
-I do not know.

474
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:20,490
Good answer.

475
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:23,230
But I don't think there is much
to this copycat angle.

476
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:25,310
Hey, but f ... the copycat.

477
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:27,500
I got Carl,
of all people,

478
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:29,760
asking whether the correlation
between these cases ...

479
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:31,940
is more than circumstantial.

480
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:33,690
And he's not the only one.

481
00:58:37,410 --> 00:58:40,200
You are not the kind of cop
who'd kill an innocent man.

482
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:43,390
And I told Carl, this much.
-Thanks for your confidence.

483
00:58:43,470 --> 00:58:45,090
Don't mention it.

484
00:58:46,910 --> 00:58:49,580
Hey, look. There was one
version of the past,

485
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:51,640
yours, mine
and the department.

486
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:53,540
That's one version.

487
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:05,000
This next photo is from
Gauthier Grisomme,

488
00:59:05,170 --> 00:59:07,230
the French master photographer.

489
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:13,100
He spent his entire life
chasing the decisive moment,

490
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:16,540
that instant when
composition, form and content ...

491
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:19,970
conspire to reveal
some fundamental truth.

492
00:59:21,310 --> 00:59:24,860
Too esoteric?
Hold that thought.

493
00:59:26,750 --> 00:59:28,140
What do you see?

494
00:59:31,210 --> 00:59:35,610
Where is the decisive moment?
What truth is revealed?

495
00:59:36,590 --> 00:59:40,230
Is this the truth?
Or this?

496
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:42,530
Or this?

497
00:59:43,170 --> 00:59:45,210
Or is it just another angle?

498
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:51,880
You're all familiar with
the Uncle Eddie case.

499
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:55,240
Now everybody's talking
about a copycat.

500
00:59:57,140 --> 01:00:00,450
If Uncle Eddie is the original,

501
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:04,650
then the copycat is the one
always trailing behind,

502
01:00:04,770 --> 01:00:09,790
compelled to reconsctruct
again and again ...

503
01:00:09,910 --> 01:00:12,700
the decisive moment
that has already happened.

504
01:00:21,620 --> 01:00:24,050
And maybe there is no copycat.

505
01:00:25,670 --> 01:00:31,370
Only a killer that has become
impatient with chance.

506
01:00:32,580 --> 01:00:36,370
No longer content to kill
his victims where they stand,

507
01:00:36,450 --> 01:00:39,930
he forces the decisive moment.

508
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:53,190
The killer painted half
of this with a pantograph,

509
01:00:53,270 --> 01:00:54,980
and I finished the rest.

510
01:00:58,380 --> 01:01:01,200
It's weird
but it makes sense, Stan.

511
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:04,880
Because he's implicating you
more and more into his crime.

512
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:07,910
I mean, you're already his patron.

513
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:11,070
Remember you bought
that painting?

514
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:14,910
Without a patron
there is no painting.

515
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:17,380
Maybe you are his Pope Innocent.

516
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:22,280
Maybe you're his crazy
object of obsession, Stan.

517
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:29,280
OK, I got Velazquez portrait of
of the Pope Innocent X.

518
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:32,830
Quite an ambivalent study
of absolute power.

519
01:01:32,910 --> 01:01:34,970
And here comes Francis Bacon.

520
01:01:35,130 --> 01:01:38,290
Despite never seeing
this painting in person,

521
01:01:38,370 --> 01:01:40,480
Bacon became so obsessed
with it ...

522
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:44,240
that he compulsively repainted it
over and over again,

523
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:47,670
but each version
more horrific than the previous.

524
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,630
Did I tell you that the latest victim
worked with me ...

525
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:09,470
on the Uncle Eddie murders?

526
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:16,500
I think you've been part of
this bizarre thing all along.

527
01:02:17,670 --> 01:02:20,580
It's not until an artist
finds his obsession ...

528
01:02:20,620 --> 01:02:24,700
that he can create
his most inpired work.

529
01:02:24,870 --> 01:02:28,070
Where he gets his obsession from,
it does't really matter

530
01:02:28,190 --> 01:02:30,340
It can be the myth of Prometheus,

531
01:02:30,460 --> 01:02:32,410
It can be another man's
painting of the Pope,

532
01:02:32,490 --> 01:02:35,850
it can even the story of
Stan Aubrey.

533
01:02:36,250 --> 01:02:37,710
It can be anything.

534
01:02:38,330 --> 01:02:42,720
So drink up.
I'll gonna show you something.

535
01:02:52,290 --> 01:02:54,080
Seems familiar right?

536
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:57,550
The artist had the real
underground cult following

537
01:02:57,630 --> 01:03:00,910
Already some show is in the
more hip galleries down town.

538
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:03,860
You wouldn't believe what
this stuff is selling for.

539
01:03:03,940 --> 01:03:05,890
What's his name?
-No name.

540
01:03:05,980 --> 01:03:07,630
...no official representation.

541
01:03:07,630 --> 01:03:10,710
Where we find it?
-Stan, that's the whole thing.

542
01:03:10,830 --> 01:03:13,460
This guy doesn't exist,
that's the whole gimmit

543
01:03:13,830 --> 01:03:15,680
The only thing you have is his work.

544
01:03:15,890 --> 01:03:17,140
What about the gallery owner?

545
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:19,890
Blowing rail since back room I guess.

546
01:03:28,570 --> 01:03:29,580
That is my chair.

547
01:03:29,740 --> 01:03:31,760
Yeah, I told you I would
help you to find ...

548
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:35,800
No, it's my chair.
-What?

549
01:03:36,570 --> 01:03:38,790
Fate
Wood and fabric

550
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:40,690
It was stolen.

551
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:47,120
We take it later.
I'll swing the car around.

552
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:48,450
No, you can't do that, Stan.

553
01:03:48,540 --> 01:03:50,970
All right, just tell them
it's evidence.

554
01:03:54,770 --> 01:03:56,260
Oh good, you're back.

555
01:03:56,390 --> 01:03:58,930
Any chance of returning our "Fate"

556
01:03:59,090 --> 01:04:02,650
What?
-The chair that you absconded with.

557
01:04:03,010 --> 01:04:05,170
I am afraid I can't do that.
-Evidence.

558
01:04:06,660 --> 01:04:08,640
I suppose you'll
beat me with rubber hoses ...

559
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:11,230
if I choose to respect
the artist's anonymity.

560
01:04:11,390 --> 01:04:13,900
No, we're not gonna do that
but you got to tell us what you know.

561
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:16,610
All I have is a name.
-Okay.

562
01:04:16,890 --> 01:04:19,120
Gerri Harden.
-Sounds a pornstar.

563
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:22,920
You got a bio, any photos?
-Not even an address.

564
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:24,540
You never asked where she lived?

565
01:04:24,700 --> 01:04:27,330
You never talked about boyfriends,
girlfriends, nothing like that?

566
01:04:27,410 --> 01:04:30,880
Detecting is your pastime,
mine is selling paintings.

567
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:34,320
And she sold quite a few.
-You weren't curious?

568
01:04:35,090 --> 01:04:36,270
We gonna have to ask
you downtown

569
01:04:36,310 --> 01:04:37,970
to give a full description anyway.

570
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:39,510
OK.

571
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:57,630
Not a single trace of fiber in any
of the crime scenes ...

572
01:04:57,750 --> 01:04:59,610
but this clay
is full of prints.

573
01:05:00,140 --> 01:05:02,090
We didn't even need to dust.

574
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,740
I'm gonna need a few hours.

575
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:20,770
You get a match?

576
01:05:20,890 --> 01:05:23,040
A match, a name
and a last known address.

577
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:36,980
It's an anagram, for a red herring.
-Come again?

578
01:07:38,710 --> 01:07:41,220
I don't think there
is a Gerri Harden.

579
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:44,490
Take a look.

580
01:08:11,210 --> 01:08:14,760
Who is that, Stan?
-It's Crystal.

581
01:08:17,670 --> 01:08:20,170
Looks like someone else thinks
he got the wrong man.

582
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:05,300
You're different from when
I first met you.

583
01:09:09,270 --> 01:09:10,720
It's funny.

584
01:09:12,660 --> 01:09:14,760
Crystal said the same thing to me.

585
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:20,750
It's going to be five years
this week.

586
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:23,450
I know.

587
01:09:24,550 --> 01:09:26,400
She was my best friend.

588
01:09:33,350 --> 01:09:35,700
There's nothing you
could have done, Stan.

589
01:09:36,030 --> 01:09:38,490
She was half dead
when you found her.

590
01:09:38,620 --> 01:09:40,680
I am sure she forgives you.

591
01:09:42,260 --> 01:09:44,120
No, she won't.

592
01:09:45,570 --> 01:09:49,340
That night
we knew Uncle Eddie ...

593
01:09:49,460 --> 01:09:51,400
had shifted his killings
to the docks.

594
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:54,110
I should've warned her,
but I didn't

595
01:09:56,540 --> 01:10:02,310
I tried to keep an eye on her but
she must have seen me and slipped away.

596
01:10:04,170 --> 01:10:07,050
By the time I got there ...

597
01:10:07,130 --> 01:10:08,910
well ...

598
01:10:12,630 --> 01:10:14,890
they were pulling her out of the water.

599
01:10:21,230 --> 01:10:23,420
Nothing I could do.

600
01:10:27,050 --> 01:10:31,900
Shul Grantz. You told her
everything was going to be OK.

601
01:10:36,790 --> 01:10:38,690
What do you think?

602
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,990
Good for you.

603
01:10:47,190 --> 01:10:49,700
I was out there that night too.

604
01:10:50,870 --> 01:10:52,200
I didn't know.

605
01:10:58,590 --> 01:11:00,090
I'm sorry.

606
01:11:54,150 --> 01:11:54,800
Aubrey.

607
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:56,220
<i>The poison heart</i>

608
01:11:56,300 --> 01:11:57,470
What?

609
01:11:58,970 --> 01:12:02,080
<i>The poison harms.
Certainly does</i>

610
01:12:03,050 --> 01:12:06,200
<i> Now you should know that. Cos you've
been poisoning yourself for years</i>

611
01:12:09,390 --> 01:12:12,380
<i> Now that you've seen my work
I want some feedback.</i>

612
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:15,940
<i>You and I both like the color blue,</i>

613
01:12:16,070 --> 01:12:19,460
<i> a pigment that was
once quite precious.</i>

614
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:23,580
<i> It is also the color of Narcicism.</i>

615
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:29,520
<i> How will you spend your final moments?
Stuck on your throne?</i>

616
01:12:29,770 --> 01:12:32,840
<i>Staring on your face
reflected in a pool of water?</i>

617
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:36,230
<i> Maybe it won't be your face in the
water but the body of a girl.</i>

618
01:12:40,370 --> 01:12:42,790
<i> Water, limpid and clear.</i>

619
01:12:45,870 --> 01:12:48,490
<i>Clear as crystal.</i>

620
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:52,050
I have a theory.

621
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:55,510
Uncle Eddie got scared and
stopped killing

622
01:12:55,750 --> 01:12:57,790
because he knew
he would get caught.

623
01:12:58,390 --> 01:12:59,770
He knew.

624
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:05,420
<i> An artist never stops working.</i>

625
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:10,760
<i>He always gathering material,
preparing a new study.</i>

626
01:13:12,140 --> 01:13:16,780
<i> I having another show.
637 Spruce.</i>

627
01:13:19,860 --> 01:13:23,300
<i> You should thank me, Stan.
We make quite a team.</i>

628
01:13:23,780 --> 01:13:26,170
<i> If it weren't for me
you'd be stuck at home</i>

629
01:13:26,330 --> 01:13:29,080
<i> riddling out your existence.</i>

630
01:15:16,270 --> 01:15:17,880
Detective Aubrey.

631
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:31,380
We did dealt it what
like you asked.

632
01:15:33,930 --> 01:15:37,120
Cover the rock when you
want to talk to the press.

633
01:16:51,230 --> 01:16:53,090
Eggs Florentine.

634
01:16:53,210 --> 01:16:55,750
No eggs today.
Cholesterol.

635
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:58,830
I told your friend
that is what you always order.

636
01:17:01,740 --> 01:17:03,550
He paid for it already.

637
01:17:05,290 --> 01:17:07,880
No, thanks. Just tea.

638
01:17:12,280 --> 01:17:13,860
Prasa carnia

639
01:17:14,750 --> 01:17:17,090
Coffee cup in the trash
by your desk.

640
01:17:17,100 --> 01:17:18,550
It was mere.

641
01:17:18,630 --> 01:17:20,370
You went through my trash?

642
01:17:22,590 --> 01:17:24,650
You are hell of a good detective, Carl.

643
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:30,590
Place is great.
I love it.

644
01:17:31,720 --> 01:17:33,740
Gina, I got to tell you old boy ...

645
01:17:34,270 --> 01:17:36,250
She's got a real mouth on her.

646
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:42,800
You know Stan, there are reems of
paper on the Uncle Eddie case.

647
01:17:43,690 --> 01:17:47,490
Enquiry transcripts,
supervisors commendation,

648
01:17:47,570 --> 01:17:48,950
case logs.

649
01:17:48,950 --> 01:17:52,790
But you know what?
No real information.

650
01:17:53,430 --> 01:17:54,660
None

651
01:17:56,070 --> 01:17:57,930
Till you caught ...

652
01:17:59,670 --> 01:18:01,480
I mean killed ...

653
01:18:03,950 --> 01:18:05,530
Sure he was the one?

654
01:18:06,580 --> 01:18:09,610
He had to be.
Killings stopped, right?

655
01:18:13,770 --> 01:18:16,850
You know back in the warehouse,
when we looking at that dead cops body

656
01:18:17,090 --> 01:18:19,560
He said you
worked with him.

657
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:20,960
You didn't mention
you met with him

658
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:22,650
the day he was murdered.

659
01:18:22,780 --> 01:18:24,880
You investigating me
or the copycat?

660
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:27,750
If I were investigating you, believe
me, you wouldn't know about it.

661
01:18:31,830 --> 01:18:34,090
Nothing you want to tell me
about the old case?

662
01:18:34,580 --> 01:18:36,280
I'm all ears.

663
01:18:38,340 --> 01:18:42,420
I'll call you if I think of anything.
-You do that.

664
01:18:43,310 --> 01:18:45,970
And while you're thinking, I'm
gonna keep on doing what I'm doing.

665
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:55,060
Let's better hope that it
doesn't lead back to Uncle Eddie.

666
01:19:06,130 --> 01:19:08,600
A Red Herring
A Poison Harms Ana

667
01:19:45,940 --> 01:19:47,920
Anamorphism

668
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:50,080
Renaissance painting technique ...

669
01:19:50,240 --> 01:19:53,310
which uses the principles
of forced perspective ...

670
01:19:53,430 --> 01:19:57,960
to construct an alternate image
within the frontal composition.

671
01:19:58,810 --> 01:20:03,130
Take this image, for example,
"The whale in pursuit of Jonah."

672
01:20:03,310 --> 01:20:07,390
If you stand at an extreme oblique
angle to the picture plane,

673
01:20:07,510 --> 01:20:12,400
A second image, often
contradicting the first will appear.

674
01:20:14,300 --> 01:20:17,940
In this case,
a peasant copping a squat.

675
01:20:19,790 --> 01:20:22,820
Holbein, this is 1536.

676
01:20:23,230 --> 01:20:27,760
Now this painting magnifies the
worldliness of two young men in ...

677
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:29,900
pursuit of life.

678
01:20:30,060 --> 01:20:34,230
But take a closer look, view it
from above and from the side ...

679
01:20:34,350 --> 01:20:37,700
and a secret message is revealed.

680
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:42,180
You're being confronted with a skull.

681
01:20:42,180 --> 01:20:44,740
Your memento mori.

682
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:51,050
It's interesting but, what does
this have to do with the case?

683
01:20:51,170 --> 01:20:55,500
All the devices
at the crime scene ...

684
01:20:55,620 --> 01:20:59,870
they are like a tutorial on
the mastery of perspective.

685
01:21:00,030 --> 01:21:04,200
But anamorphosis
subverts the visual plane ...

686
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:08,240
canceling out all that you've learned
about fixed perspective.

687
01:21:08,530 --> 01:21:12,170
There is always another angle,
another meaning.

688
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:18,080
The truth depends
where you stand.

689
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:19,250
Yeah.

690
01:21:20,530 --> 01:21:24,050
You got to go back
look at things from a different angle.

691
01:23:50,910 --> 01:23:53,010
<i> Hey, back here!
Vamos!</i>

692
01:23:53,580 --> 01:23:55,880
<¡> Come, we go!

693
01:24:24,250 --> 01:24:25,670
<i> Stan ...</i>

694
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:28,260
<i> Stan ...</i>

695
01:24:29,880 --> 01:24:31,290
<i> Okay, fine.</i>

696
01:24:31,290 --> 01:24:32,290
<i> Hi</i>

697
01:24:32,790 --> 01:24:36,260
<i>I promised my folks whatever
gonna wait for you to call me</i>

698
01:24:36,340 --> 01:24:39,740
<i> but then I realized that I
would probably be waiting forever.</i>

699
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:43,820
<i> I want to see you again.</i>

700
01:24:43,980 --> 01:24:45,480
<i>Call me or a ... </i>

701
01:24:45,570 --> 01:24:48,720
<i> I have a meeting tonight.
You can pick me up after that.</i>

702
01:25:06,580 --> 01:25:08,640
<i> Hi, it's Sandy.
Leave a message.</i>

703
01:25:12,770 --> 01:25:13,670
Sandy?

704
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:14,970
<i> No, it's Carl.
Who is Sandy?</i>

705
01:25:15,050 --> 01:25:15,980
What do you want?

706
01:25:16,030 --> 01:25:17,250
<i> Stan, let me talk to you.</i>

707
01:25:17,730 --> 01:25:18,820
I can't talk right now.

708
01:25:18,860 --> 01:25:20,640
<i>Stan, I need to talk to you
or come to you</i>

709
01:25:20,760 --> 01:25:21,860
I'll call you back

710
01:25:45,660 --> 01:25:47,130
Can I help you?

711
01:25:48,420 --> 01:25:51,900
Yes, I am looking for a
Sandy Strickler.

712
01:25:51,980 --> 01:25:54,330
Oh, we do not use last names here.

713
01:25:59,830 --> 01:26:02,280
She left just soon as she got here.

714
01:26:02,490 --> 01:26:06,610
It was obvious that she wasn't sober.
-Are you sure?

715
01:26:07,370 --> 01:26:11,010
Her sponsor was kind enough
to take her home.

716
01:26:14,970 --> 01:26:18,890
Have you ever seen this man,
the man standing behind her?

717
01:26:18,970 --> 01:26:21,560
That's Michael C.
-Michael C?

718
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:23,540
That's her sponsor.

719
01:26:24,630 --> 01:26:26,010
¿What's his last name?

720
01:26:27,230 --> 01:26:30,950
Alcoholics Anonymous. It Anony ...
-Anonymous, I know.

721
01:26:31,050 --> 01:26:32,300
Stan ...

722
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:35,130
Michael left this for you.

723
01:26:47,150 --> 01:26:48,110
What was that?
-I do not know what it is,

724
01:26:48,140 --> 01:26:49,660
he just gave me the package.

725
01:27:28,410 --> 01:27:32,080
You have always 'stood the scum
of the rose on my ankle.

726
01:27:35,150 --> 01:27:38,140
I can't believe that
I let you talk me into this.

727
01:28:05,980 --> 01:28:08,570
You sure you're not too high
to do to straighten out?

728
01:28:08,690 --> 01:28:10,150
I'm fine.

729
01:28:12,050 --> 01:28:14,270
Why is it you never seem high?

730
01:28:16,050 --> 01:28:18,950
Would never put that
poison into my veins.

731
01:28:35,240 --> 01:28:37,300
Hey, hey.
-I'm sorry.

732
01:28:41,020 --> 01:28:42,390
Can I see it?
-No.

733
01:28:43,590 --> 01:28:46,640
Why won't you let me see it?
-Just ...

734
01:28:46,720 --> 01:28:48,700
Wait, let me look at it.
-Let me work.

735
01:28:50,440 --> 01:28:53,430
Oh God, you know what.
I need a break.

736
01:36:25,570 --> 01:36:27,910
Death
