1
00:01:49,052 --> 00:01:51,077
Oh, shit.

2
00:02:11,606 --> 00:02:12,766
You just got Wolfed.

3
00:02:13,674 --> 00:02:15,539
- What?
- That is an official trademark...

4
00:02:15,744 --> 00:02:17,507
...that I am getting registered.

5
00:02:17,713 --> 00:02:20,682
It's a lot of stuff you gotta do,
hoops you gotta jump through.

6
00:02:20,881 --> 00:02:22,109
Gotta get on the Internet.

7
00:02:22,316 --> 00:02:26,480
Gotta go to some stupid-ass website
where you register a catch phrase.

8
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:30,021
I wanted "Bam,"
but Emeril had taken it.

9
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:33,653
I'm rambling, man.
Get up, man. Get up, man.

10
00:02:37,131 --> 00:02:38,462
Is the contender ready?

11
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:41,066
- Ready.
- Is the gladiator ready?

12
00:02:43,236 --> 00:02:45,636
Three, two, one.

13
00:02:46,106 --> 00:02:47,698
Things are heating up for the Wolf.

14
00:02:48,275 --> 00:02:50,140
I just opened a Target in Reseda...

15
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:53,540
...and my own brand of BBQ sauce.

16
00:02:54,014 --> 00:02:59,384
I'm calling it Wolf's BBQ Sauce,
available in regular and chipotle.

17
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,050
You still going?
You still want more of this, man?

18
00:03:03,256 --> 00:03:05,247
I learned that in Oriental land.

19
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:08,325
Whoa, yeah. U.S. A!

20
00:03:13,432 --> 00:03:16,333
They're so small anyway, from steroids.

21
00:03:40,224 --> 00:03:41,418
A saber-tooth.

22
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:46,129
Amy Winehouse?

23
00:03:51,402 --> 00:03:52,596
Piss off.

24
00:03:52,803 --> 00:03:55,772
You don't wanna mess with
a bitch straight out of rehab.

25
00:03:56,574 --> 00:04:01,944
Listen, like the dinosaurs
being destroyed by the Ice Age...

26
00:04:02,146 --> 00:04:05,547
...you, too, will soon be extinct.

27
00:04:05,749 --> 00:04:06,977
When?

28
00:04:07,185 --> 00:04:10,086
- How much time do we have?
- Bloody hell.

29
00:04:10,587 --> 00:04:13,317
Just calm down.
Do you know you're speaking so fast...

30
00:04:13,523 --> 00:04:16,890
...I can't even hear, mate?
You're making my head hurt.

31
00:04:17,094 --> 00:04:18,994
Or maybe that was
the gasoline I drank.

32
00:04:19,195 --> 00:04:24,030
Oh, my God, it was good.
Oh, God, I love drinking gasoline.

33
00:04:24,234 --> 00:04:26,498
It's excellent for the vocal cords.

34
00:04:26,703 --> 00:04:28,295
That's my little secret.

35
00:04:28,505 --> 00:04:30,803
- You're welcome.
- How much time do we have?

36
00:04:31,842 --> 00:04:33,571
Let me see.

37
00:04:33,777 --> 00:04:34,903
Hang on a bit.

38
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:37,437
There we go.

39
00:04:38,481 --> 00:04:40,779
All right, let's have a look-see.

40
00:04:43,518 --> 00:04:45,110
Everyone's on Facebook.

41
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,288
It says...

42
00:04:48,524 --> 00:04:54,463
...that the end of the world
will be August 29th, 28.

43
00:04:57,967 --> 00:04:59,025
Oh, God.

44
00:05:02,136 --> 00:05:03,899
Bottoms up.

45
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:52,875
Sick.

46
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:56,750
Mark my words, leather boy.

47
00:05:57,124 --> 00:05:58,921
Cave dweller.

48
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:01,719
Beaver hunter.

49
00:06:03,562 --> 00:06:08,363
Your doom lies with this.

50
00:06:11,069 --> 00:06:14,561
- The crystal skull.
- That's right. Did your nibblies go tight?

51
00:06:14,773 --> 00:06:17,264
Yeah, they did. Just went up
inside you, didn't they?

52
00:06:26,418 --> 00:06:27,544
Oh, boy.

53
00:06:34,092 --> 00:06:36,993
I knew I shouldn't have
taken all those Ambien.

54
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:50,238
Amy. Wake up, baby.
I just had the weirdest dream.

55
00:06:50,874 --> 00:06:52,341
Amy.

56
00:06:52,643 --> 00:06:54,076
What? What the...?

57
00:06:54,278 --> 00:06:57,645
Flava-Flav! Yeah, boy!

58
00:06:57,848 --> 00:07:00,146
I've been giving your girl
the flavor of love.

59
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:03,911
She's been sucking
my clock all night long.

60
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,644
Get the hell out of here, Flava!

61
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:08,788
I'm Flava-Flav!

62
00:07:12,694 --> 00:07:15,060
- What is that about?
- What?

63
00:07:15,264 --> 00:07:17,494
You said you didn't
wanna be in a relationship.

64
00:07:18,401 --> 00:07:20,995
I know, but Flava?

65
00:07:22,371 --> 00:07:23,998
Will...

66
00:07:25,743 --> 00:07:27,643
...I wanna take it to the next level.

67
00:07:32,948 --> 00:07:34,108
I love you.

68
00:07:35,885 --> 00:07:37,819
I like you too.

69
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:42,152
Oh, man.

70
00:07:43,493 --> 00:07:45,518
Look, you don't understand.

71
00:07:45,727 --> 00:07:48,161
I think the world is coming to an end.

72
00:07:49,196 --> 00:07:51,426
That's a way of saying
you have commitment issues.

73
00:07:53,368 --> 00:07:56,826
Unbelievable. Come on, Jojo.

74
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:00,697
You're taking Jojo?

75
00:08:02,209 --> 00:08:03,198
Goodbye, Will.

76
00:08:05,714 --> 00:08:07,807
Are you still coming
to my Sweet 16 party?

77
00:08:08,382 --> 00:08:09,849
You're 25.

78
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:12,518
- I never had one.
- Grow up.

79
00:08:39,578 --> 00:08:40,909
Yeah.

80
00:08:43,582 --> 00:08:46,449
- Hey.
- Yeah.

81
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:07,494
Amy, you came.

82
00:09:21,752 --> 00:09:23,219
Come on.

83
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:25,613
Oh, hey, Will.

84
00:09:25,823 --> 00:09:28,053
- Happy Sweet 16.
- Thanks.

85
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:31,185
Take a look at these.

86
00:09:31,395 --> 00:09:32,862
Oh, God.

87
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:39,261
Hey, Will. It's your buddy, Dr. Phil.

88
00:09:42,806 --> 00:09:45,741
Hey, let me show you
why my frat brothers...

89
00:09:45,942 --> 00:09:48,809
...used to call me Dr. Phil-You-Up.

90
00:09:49,012 --> 00:09:51,037
Oh, hey, baby.

91
00:09:56,086 --> 00:09:58,748
Dyke. Come back here, I like it rough.

92
00:09:59,555 --> 00:10:02,388
Hey, Will, where's that
girlfriend of yours, Amy?

93
00:10:02,591 --> 00:10:04,491
Don't let her get away.

94
00:10:04,693 --> 00:10:08,720
She's a real quality girl,
a real keeper, like that one.

95
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:10,625
Hey, come on back here, you whore.

96
00:10:11,167 --> 00:10:12,725
Thanks.

97
00:10:14,436 --> 00:10:15,994
Yo!

98
00:10:16,472 --> 00:10:20,135
Let's prank his ass. He passed out.

99
00:10:29,517 --> 00:10:30,779
He's sleeping like a baby.

100
00:10:31,352 --> 00:10:34,116
We can put his hands in warm water.

101
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:36,818
Or I have a better idea.

102
00:10:37,025 --> 00:10:39,755
- Call it.
- Tails.

103
00:10:42,529 --> 00:10:43,518
It is tails.

104
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:58,034
Punch.

105
00:11:01,748 --> 00:11:03,340
What's up, baby?

106
00:11:03,983 --> 00:11:05,883
Those guys are trying
to steal our booze.

107
00:11:06,086 --> 00:11:07,815
- What?
- We gotta get the alcohol...

108
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:11,183
...so we can get the girls drunk
so we can finally get laid.

109
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:12,721
I am McLover.

110
00:11:12,926 --> 00:11:15,190
- Yeah, I know.
- I am McLover.

111
00:11:15,395 --> 00:11:18,523
- Stop saying that.
- I am McLover.

112
00:11:18,731 --> 00:11:20,460
God, you are such a douche.

113
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:22,964
Yeah, fake ID, what?

114
00:11:23,469 --> 00:11:25,369
Just get the booze.

115
00:11:25,571 --> 00:11:27,664
Nobody tries to steal my Goldschläger.

116
00:11:27,873 --> 00:11:29,966
Shoot the target.

117
00:11:32,678 --> 00:11:35,806
Lisa, how am I supposed to do that?
I don't even have a clear shot.

118
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:47,816
- Curve the bullet.
- Say what?

119
00:11:48,459 --> 00:11:52,190
You can control the bullet
to go wherever you want.

120
00:11:57,568 --> 00:11:59,695
Don't tell him what to do. He's my man.

121
00:11:59,904 --> 00:12:01,997
Back off, bitch.
You don't want none of me.

122
00:12:07,411 --> 00:12:08,901
Shit.

123
00:12:10,282 --> 00:12:11,408
Get off of me.

124
00:12:20,124 --> 00:12:21,921
Come on, bitch.

125
00:12:38,173 --> 00:12:39,265
Take that, bitch.

126
00:12:45,815 --> 00:12:46,907
How do you like that?

127
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:55,590
Pretty little thing.
Oh, look at you laying there.

128
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:59,318
I should kiss you. Give me a kiss, baby.

129
00:13:16,311 --> 00:13:18,108
Left foot, yellow.

130
00:13:19,347 --> 00:13:20,780
Calvin?

131
00:13:20,981 --> 00:13:22,642
Calvin.

132
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:25,819
- Are you gonna curve the bullet or what?
- Hello?

133
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,854
Yeah. Yeah, right, right.

134
00:13:32,526 --> 00:13:35,086
Let's go back to my hot tub.
You can suck on my...

135
00:13:36,831 --> 00:13:39,493
- Damn.
- Sorry, Phil.

136
00:13:44,304 --> 00:13:47,273
Shit. I can... I can do this.

137
00:13:53,546 --> 00:13:55,343
- Shit. Hurry up.
- Dude.

138
00:13:56,516 --> 00:13:58,677
Just curve the bullet.

139
00:13:58,884 --> 00:14:01,045
I know you have the power.

140
00:14:18,836 --> 00:14:21,828
Fucking hurry up. Hurry up.

141
00:14:23,409 --> 00:14:24,842
Nice shot, asshole.

142
00:14:32,818 --> 00:14:36,015
<i>Juney, why won't you
Have an abortion?</i>

143
00:14:36,221 --> 00:14:39,281
<i>You're not exactly part of
The Christian Coalition</i>

144
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:43,824
<i>I could just grab a wire hanger
And do it myself</i>

145
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:49,158
<i>Like Jamie Lynn Spears
I'm keeping this baby</i>

146
00:14:49,367 --> 00:14:52,495
<i>And, look, stud
You are no George Clooney</i>

147
00:14:52,703 --> 00:14:57,333
<i>In fact, I just sold the baby
To the highest bidder on eBay</i>

148
00:15:02,245 --> 00:15:05,373
<i>You're a sarcastic teen
Who talks like she's 30...</i>

149
00:15:20,529 --> 00:15:22,759
- Think Amy's coming tonight?
- Man, I don't know.

150
00:15:22,965 --> 00:15:24,990
That's your girlfriend.

151
00:15:25,202 --> 00:15:26,760
Actually, we broke up.

152
00:15:26,969 --> 00:15:29,301
Oh, you want some new booty.

153
00:15:29,505 --> 00:15:30,733
- A little Asian freak.
- No...

154
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:33,306
<i>A little "One Night in Bangkok,"
a little sake-sake.</i>

155
00:15:33,509 --> 00:15:36,444
<i>I saw Memoirs of a Geisha.
I know that shit goes on.</i>

156
00:15:36,645 --> 00:15:38,613
I'm in love with her.

157
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:40,906
Then what your dumb ass
break up with her for?

158
00:15:41,115 --> 00:15:42,878
It never would've worked out.

159
00:15:43,085 --> 00:15:45,315
It's better to end it
than to end up hurting her.

160
00:15:45,521 --> 00:15:48,217
You know what?
You got commitment issues, dog.

161
00:15:48,423 --> 00:15:51,449
Well, I didn't exactly have
the best example growing up.

162
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:54,059
I never even knew my dad.
He split when I was young.

163
00:15:56,197 --> 00:15:58,324
That's your girl right there.

164
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:03,164
Who's that dude she with?

165
00:16:03,371 --> 00:16:06,465
She started dating some
Calvin Klein underwear model.

166
00:16:10,978 --> 00:16:13,845
Forget about her, man.
I got something that'll cheer you up.

167
00:16:17,818 --> 00:16:20,810
Dude, what is up
with the marching band?

168
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:23,818
What better way to celebrate
your super-duper Sweet 16...

169
00:16:24,424 --> 00:16:26,016
...than with a high school musical?

170
00:16:34,935 --> 00:16:38,962
<i>Tonight, tonight
We're gonna get real crunk</i>

171
00:16:39,171 --> 00:16:42,800
<i>Tonight, tonight,
A bum's peeing in the punch</i>

172
00:16:48,114 --> 00:16:51,880
<i>Hello, my friends
You're all at my party</i>

173
00:16:52,085 --> 00:16:56,112
<i>It's so good to see all of you</i>

174
00:16:56,321 --> 00:17:00,348
<i>My ex-girl, Amy
And my main man, Calvin</i>

175
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:04,461
<i>And the priest that molested me too</i>

176
00:17:04,664 --> 00:17:08,361
<i>That reminds me
Of the time I was in college</i>

177
00:17:08,567 --> 00:17:11,127
<i>I was experimenting</i>

178
00:17:12,771 --> 00:17:16,468
<i>Hooking up with a hot
Foreign-exchange student</i>

179
00:17:16,674 --> 00:17:20,576
<i>I think his name was Hop Sing</i>

180
00:17:21,178 --> 00:17:24,909
<i>We'll all be friends forever</i>

181
00:17:25,115 --> 00:17:29,245

Destroys the city</i>

<i>We'll all be friends forever</i>

183
00:17:33,424 --> 00:17:38,293
<i>Because if that happened
It'd be kind of shitty</i>

184
00:17:39,296 --> 00:17:41,389
<i>One, two, three, four</i>

185
00:17:41,932 --> 00:17:45,629
<i>After we split
I took the break-up real hard</i>

186
00:17:45,836 --> 00:17:50,000
<i>- I started foolin' around
- Foolin' around</i>

187
00:17:50,206 --> 00:17:54,040
<i>I did a black dude
I thought he was Kanye</i>

188
00:17:54,244 --> 00:17:57,941
<i>And the Jonas Brothers all got down</i>

189
00:17:58,146 --> 00:18:02,082
<i>Now that you're split
I'll get her hooked on the reefer</i>

190
00:18:02,286 --> 00:18:06,620
<i>Yeah, I'll start pimping her out</i>

191
00:18:06,823 --> 00:18:09,291
- Wait, what?
- Hey, hey, now.

192
00:18:09,692 --> 00:18:12,957
<i>Snoop Dogg's got nothin' on this playa</i>

193
00:18:13,161 --> 00:18:18,030
<i>I'll get the first prize at the Playa's Ball</i>

194
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,130
<i>Hey, hey, man, whoa!</i>

195
00:18:21,337 --> 00:18:24,670
<i>Yeah, it's going on and on
We can do it all day long</i>

196
00:18:24,873 --> 00:18:28,001
<i>It's the new phenomenon, whoa!</i>

197
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:32,112
<i>Yeah, it's going on and on
It's the new phenomenon</i>

198
00:18:33,381 --> 00:18:37,249
<i>We'll all be friends forever</i>

199
00:18:37,452 --> 00:18:41,115
<i>Unless a random disaster
Destroys the city</i>

200
00:18:41,323 --> 00:18:45,225
<i>We'll all be friends forever</i>

201
00:18:45,426 --> 00:18:50,261
<i>Because if that happened
It'd be kind of shitty</i>

202
00:18:51,465 --> 00:18:53,626
<i>One, two, three, four</i>

203
00:18:53,835 --> 00:18:56,565
J.T.'s here. J. T!

204
00:19:00,074 --> 00:19:01,598
<i>Oh, babe</i>

205
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:06,005
<i>If I sang you a melody</i>

206
00:19:06,212 --> 00:19:10,672
<i>Would you toss me
Your panties?</i>

207
00:19:17,557 --> 00:19:19,149
<i>I don't mean to be a boastful man</i>

208
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:21,384
<i>But I've done groupies
in my touring van</i>

209
00:19:21,595 --> 00:19:23,460
<i>Britney, Cameron, Scarlett too</i>

210
00:19:23,664 --> 00:19:25,757
<i>They all like a taste of my fondue</i>

211
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:30,967
<i>Come to think of it
I've had so much ass</i>

212
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:33,799
<i>All that's left for me is Lance Bass</i>

213
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:38,142
Look, everyone. It's Jessica Simpson.

214
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:56,350
<i>My boobs are for Jesus</i>

215
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:58,860
<i>All of this, all for Jesus</i>

216
00:19:59,063 --> 00:20:00,621
Put your pants back on, Dad.

217
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:04,563
Go, Romo! Oh, my God.
He's gonna score a basket goal.

218
00:20:04,769 --> 00:20:07,499
Wait. What's it called again?
Oh, my gosh, I totally forget.

219
00:20:07,704 --> 00:20:09,831
What is it, a rubdown?

220
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,940
What? A tickle down.

221
00:20:12,143 --> 00:20:14,839
Oh, a touchdown.

222
00:20:15,046 --> 00:20:16,570
Frigging jinx.

223
00:20:18,548 --> 00:20:20,140
Gosh.

224
00:20:20,917 --> 00:20:24,512

00:20:39,069 --> 00:20:41,765
<i>One, two, three, four, hooray!</i>

229
00:20:46,442 --> 00:20:47,932
What's going on?

230
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:56,008
What the hell was that?

231

<i>This is an emergency broadcast.</i>

233
00:21:00,589 --> 00:21:02,557
Shut up, everybody. Listen.

234
00:21:02,757 --> 00:21:04,281
<i>Something has jolted the city.</i>

235
00:21:04,493 --> 00:21:08,156
<i>We're getting reports it could be
an earthquake or some shit like that.</i>

236
00:21:08,364 --> 00:21:09,388
Oh, shit.

237
00:21:09,597 --> 00:21:13,294
<i>Seismologists have marked

<i>... wear Abercrombie & Fitch,

241
00:21:23,177 --> 00:21:24,974
Oh, God, we're all gonna die!

242
00:21:26,413 --> 00:21:28,438
Take a Xanax, Fabio.

243
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:32,586
You're wigging harder than a
smack addict at an lggy show circa '73.

244
00:21:33,053 --> 00:21:34,179
What?

245
00:21:34,389 --> 00:21:38,382
It's cool, Moe Dee. Sir Cries-a-Lot.

246
00:21:38,992 --> 00:21:40,983
You're totally giving me the stink eye.

247
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:44,764
FYI, Battlecrotch Galactica...

248
00:21:44,965 --> 00:21:47,195
...you're grape smuggling
harder than Cornelius...

249
00:21:47,401 --> 00:21:51,303
<i>...in Planet of the Apes.
The original, not Tim Burton's.</i>

250
00:21:51,506 --> 00:21:54,498
And BT-dubs,
I haven't seen a six-pack like that...

251
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:58,144
...since I shotgunned
Molson Golden at Lollapalooza.

252
00:21:58,811 --> 00:22:00,676
I don't understand a thing you're saying.

253
00:22:00,881 --> 00:22:05,318
That's because I speak in overly written,
clever-for-clever's-sake quips.

254
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,690
Time to get this sea monkey plastered.

<i>This is an emergency broadcast.</i>

256
00:22:38,149 --> 00:22:41,607
- Amy. Are you okay?
- Yeah.

257
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,488
Why did you bring
another guy to my party?

258
00:22:44,689 --> 00:22:47,453
- Why do you care?
- Because l...

259
00:22:48,859 --> 00:22:50,326
I don't.

260
00:22:51,862 --> 00:22:53,454
I'm out of here.

261
00:22:53,665 --> 00:22:54,859
Later, bitch.

262
00:22:56,267 --> 00:22:57,495
You know what, Will?

263
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:01,192
Every time we made love,
I was thinking about another guy.

264
00:23:02,171 --> 00:23:03,695
Well, so was I.

265
00:23:07,944 --> 00:23:09,741
- Damn it.
- Will!

266
00:23:10,748 --> 00:23:12,306
You gotta hear this.

267
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:15,811
<i>The quake erupted a gas main
and destroyed the ghetto.</i>

268
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:20,319
<i>- I can live with that.

269
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:22,424

<i>... that asteroids are falling
out of the sky and...</i>

271
00:23:25,395 --> 00:23:26,555
End of the world.

272
00:23:26,762 --> 00:23:28,889
<i>And a Pinkberry
has just been destroyed.</i>

273
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:35,401
It's like my dream.

274
00:23:37,538 --> 00:23:40,701
<i>I repeat, a Pinkberry
has just been destroyed.</i>

275
00:23:59,894 --> 00:24:01,828
God, what the hell's happening?

276
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:04,521
- I think it's the apocalypse.
- It's Armageddon.

277
00:24:04,733 --> 00:24:06,291
I think I just shit myself.

278
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:23,539
Let's go.

279
00:24:26,553 --> 00:24:29,317
Oh, my God. Hannah Montana's dead.

280
00:24:31,459 --> 00:24:33,893
Oh, no.

281
00:24:34,094 --> 00:24:37,530
Well, goodbye, all my fans.

282
00:24:37,731 --> 00:24:39,289
Keep rocking.

283
00:24:47,339 --> 00:24:51,105
She is a national treasure!

284
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:57,175
Also, remind your parents...

285
00:24:57,383 --> 00:25:00,819
...to pick up your official
Hannah Montana lunchbox...

286
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:03,181
...Hannah Montana cheese grater...

287
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:05,324
...and Hannah Montana toilet paper.

288
00:25:05,524 --> 00:25:09,221
And be sure to tune in
to my Summer in Montana concert...

289
00:25:09,428 --> 00:25:13,558
...this Wednesday, 8, 7 Central.

290
00:25:15,967 --> 00:25:19,459
I waited in line
for two days for these tickets.

291
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:21,194
Damn.

292
00:25:23,441 --> 00:25:29,676
And let me just say, those totally sexy
and utterly provocative pictures of me...

293
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:35,318
...were leaked onto MySpace
completely without my permission.

294
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:38,254
But if you'll notice in those pictures...

295
00:25:38,455 --> 00:25:40,423
...l'm wearing my new line of sexy...

296
00:25:40,625 --> 00:25:46,325
...Hannah Montana lingerie,
now available at Target.

297
00:25:55,505 --> 00:25:58,030
Oh, my God. Hannah Montana
is really Miley Cyrus.

298
00:25:58,241 --> 00:26:01,005
Well, duh. No shit, Sherlock.

299
00:26:01,211 --> 00:26:04,669
All I do is wear a wig
and change my voice a little bit...

300
00:26:04,881 --> 00:26:08,044
...and those dumb kids
can't tell the difference.

301
00:26:08,251 --> 00:26:11,846
Then I get twice the pay
and twice the merchandise.

302
00:26:12,054 --> 00:26:14,420
Just a reminder,
my new CD comes out.

303
00:26:14,623 --> 00:26:17,558
<i>Miley Cyrus: Underage.</i>

304
00:26:17,761 --> 00:26:22,357
It's available in stores now.
Featuring songs from my dad, Billy Ray.

305
00:26:22,566 --> 00:26:25,865
Only 9.95.

306
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:31,571
Can somebody help us?

307
00:26:31,773 --> 00:26:33,707
Isn't there anybody that can help?

308
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,277
Hey, Hancock.

309
00:26:41,249 --> 00:26:42,910
Hancock?

310
00:26:43,785 --> 00:26:45,013
We need help.

311
00:26:46,955 --> 00:26:48,616
Wake up, you drunk motherfucker.

312
00:26:48,823 --> 00:26:52,020
Get your punk ass up,
fly down there, and fix that shit.

313
00:26:53,995 --> 00:26:55,860
Asshole!

314
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:03,403
Oh, hell, no.

315
00:27:03,604 --> 00:27:05,401
Big Willie's out of here.

316
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:15,307
I need a drink.

317
00:27:23,323 --> 00:27:25,086
Holy shit!

318
00:27:25,291 --> 00:27:27,555
- It's coming this way.
- What should we do?

319
00:27:27,761 --> 00:27:30,696
- Come on, guys. Let's get out of here.
- Let's go!

320
00:27:33,433 --> 00:27:35,560
This way. Over here.
Come on. Come on.

321
00:27:36,102 --> 00:27:37,126
Go, go, go.

322
00:27:44,944 --> 00:27:47,936
- What are we gonna do now?
- Baby, I don't know.

323
00:27:48,146 --> 00:27:49,408
Look, we'll just...

324
00:27:49,614 --> 00:27:52,242
We'll wait out the storm here
until it passes by.

325
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,810
Hey.

326
00:28:01,293 --> 00:28:03,261
This is our hiding place.

327
00:28:03,462 --> 00:28:06,590
Get lost. Right, Carrie?

328
00:28:07,965 --> 00:28:09,489
Hello, lover.

329
00:28:12,804 --> 00:28:14,863
Unless you wanna fight.

330
00:28:15,072 --> 00:28:17,131
Look, we don't want any trouble.

331
00:28:23,748 --> 00:28:24,976
I never back down.

332
00:28:25,182 --> 00:28:30,051
- Get some.
- As you can see, I already did.

333
00:28:33,857 --> 00:28:37,520
<i>And so I thought: Could a simple
New York City gal like me...</i>

334
00:28:37,728 --> 00:28:41,494
<i>... really beat the shit
out of a pregnant teenager? I wonder.</i>

335
00:28:41,698 --> 00:28:46,192
<i>Like Dolph Lundgren in Rocky IV,

336
00:28:54,509 --> 00:28:56,067
- Yes!
- Yeah!

337
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:18,362
I'm lactating. Moo.

338
00:29:20,235 --> 00:29:22,533
Got milk?

339
00:29:30,945 --> 00:29:32,606
Oh, God.

340
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:40,680
- Is that your feet?
- Yeah.

341
00:29:40,888 --> 00:29:43,448
And this is my baby's foot.

342
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,456
Smell it.

343
00:29:49,497 --> 00:29:50,521
And taste it.

344
00:29:52,266 --> 00:29:54,291
Suck on my placenta.

345
00:29:57,404 --> 00:30:00,168
- Yeah!
- Oh, Carrie.

346
00:30:00,373 --> 00:30:02,364
Carrie, darling, are you all right?

347
00:30:02,575 --> 00:30:05,237
Come on, ladies.
Let's get out of here now.

348
00:30:11,318 --> 00:30:13,218
- What the hell's going on?
- I don't know.

349
00:30:13,419 --> 00:30:15,944
Wake up and smell the Prius.

350
00:30:16,155 --> 00:30:20,057
I know it's an inconvenient truth,
but it's called global warming.

351
00:30:20,259 --> 00:30:23,092
No. No, it's not global warming.

352
00:30:24,597 --> 00:30:26,792
Amy Winehouse
came to me in my dreams...

353
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,831
...after I fought an American Gladiator.

354
00:30:29,301 --> 00:30:31,792
I think it has something to do
with the crystal skull...

355
00:30:33,173 --> 00:30:35,903
Come on. Crackhead Winehouse?
Crystal skull?

356
00:30:36,107 --> 00:30:37,404
You sound like a crazy man.

357
00:30:37,608 --> 00:30:41,135
Look, it's getting late. Let's just stay
here tonight and wait out the storm.

358
00:30:41,579 --> 00:30:42,910
I'm freezing.

359
00:30:43,449 --> 00:30:44,848
We gotta take off our clothes.

360
00:30:46,918 --> 00:30:50,547
- What?
- Our bodies will keep each other warm.

361
00:30:50,755 --> 00:30:53,622
Otherwise, we're not gonna make it
through the night.

362
00:30:54,592 --> 00:30:55,923
Yeah. Yeah.

363
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,851
He's right. Come on.

364
00:31:08,038 --> 00:31:10,097
I think my water's gonna break.

365
00:31:10,841 --> 00:31:11,830
Water?

366
00:31:15,578 --> 00:31:17,239
What the...?

367
00:31:18,415 --> 00:31:20,007
Sorry.

368
00:31:24,487 --> 00:31:27,217
Look, I have something to tell you.
I'm not really a banker.

369
00:31:27,424 --> 00:31:28,948
- I'm a jumper.
- A what?

370
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:30,888
I can teleport through time and space.

371
00:32:00,156 --> 00:32:02,590
I hope we stay together forever.

372
00:32:02,792 --> 00:32:03,986
I love you.

373
00:32:06,394 --> 00:32:07,759
Later.

374
00:32:11,866 --> 00:32:15,199
I am Prince Caspian,
here to save Narnia.

375
00:32:18,305 --> 00:32:19,863
Little help?

376
00:32:21,544 --> 00:32:23,171
You guys?

377
00:32:27,381 --> 00:32:29,349
<i>It's the guy who ruined Star Wars.</i>

378
00:32:34,954 --> 00:32:37,889
- What?
- Will, we saw your dream.

379
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:43,158
- Oh, man.
- Man, you messed shit up with Amy.

380
00:32:43,363 --> 00:32:45,957
You're lucky a girl like that
would even talk to you.

381
00:32:46,165 --> 00:32:49,259
She's hot, sexy. She got a job.

382
00:32:49,635 --> 00:32:53,127
- Man, that girl out your league.
- She's not out of my league.

383
00:32:53,339 --> 00:32:56,103
Shit, she gotta put up
with your stank breath.

384
00:32:56,777 --> 00:33:00,144
Not to mention your
abnormally high plumber's crack.

385
00:33:05,351 --> 00:33:06,648
Man, put your shirt down.

386
00:33:06,853 --> 00:33:09,879
All right. You're right, you're right.
I messed up with Amy.

387
00:33:13,192 --> 00:33:14,955
I never should've let her go.

388
00:33:17,462 --> 00:33:20,090
Jesus Christ. That was a rump shaker.

389
00:33:20,298 --> 00:33:23,631
Okay, here's the plan.
We gotta get the hell up out this city.

390
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,427
What you say?

391
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:29,435
What the hell y'all doing leaving me?

392
00:33:31,944 --> 00:33:34,139
Keep it moving, people. Nothing to see.

393
00:33:35,145 --> 00:33:38,478
All the disasters have been contained.
The city is secure.

394
00:33:44,855 --> 00:33:45,844
Shit.

395
00:33:47,357 --> 00:33:48,346
Sick.

396
00:33:51,127 --> 00:33:54,119
Like I said, keep moving.
It's under control.

397
00:33:59,136 --> 00:34:00,125
I'm out of here.

398
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:09,746
- What was that?
- That was a head. That was a head.

399
00:34:09,946 --> 00:34:12,437
- Hello?
- Whose head?

400
00:34:12,649 --> 00:34:13,946
<i>- Hello?
- Will, it's me.</i>

401
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:15,947
Amy, where are you?

402
00:34:16,153 --> 00:34:19,213
I'm at work at the museum.
I was worried about the artifacts.

403
00:34:19,422 --> 00:34:22,357
- Are you okay?
- I'm scared.

404
00:34:22,959 --> 00:34:24,950
It's gonna be all right, I promise. Listen.

405
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:27,924
There is something
that I need to tell you...

406
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:30,394
...and I should've told you long before.
I was an idiot.

407
00:34:34,536 --> 00:34:35,560
I love you.

408
00:34:38,072 --> 00:34:40,370
<i>Oh, baby, I love you too.</i>

409
00:34:42,511 --> 00:34:46,311
What do...? What do you say?
Do you still love me?

410
00:34:46,514 --> 00:34:49,244
<i>Yes, yes, of course, yes.</i>

411
00:34:49,952 --> 00:34:50,941
<i>Say something.</i>

412
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:54,578
Say something, you stuck-up bitch.

413
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,386
Asshole.

414
00:35:01,229 --> 00:35:02,821
Hello? Hello, Amy?

415
00:35:03,731 --> 00:35:05,358
Shit.

416
00:35:07,802 --> 00:35:09,599
Oh, what the...?

417
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:12,270
- We gotta go back.
- Say what?

418
00:35:12,473 --> 00:35:14,270
Amy's in trouble.
I'm going back for her.

419
00:35:14,474 --> 00:35:16,567
I let her go before.
I'm not losing her again.

420
00:35:16,777 --> 00:35:19,974
Man, you crazy. There's all kinds
of shit breaking out in the city.

421
00:35:20,181 --> 00:35:22,672
We don't leave right now,
we're gonna die.

422
00:35:22,882 --> 00:35:24,543
It's something I gotta do.

423
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:25,842
You guys keep going.

424
00:35:29,322 --> 00:35:31,415
No, I'm your boy, man.
I'm gonna roll with you.

425
00:35:31,625 --> 00:35:34,025
Yeah, I mean, I'm already knocked up...

426
00:35:34,226 --> 00:35:38,390
...so, what other shenanigans
can I really get into?

427
00:35:38,598 --> 00:35:42,125
<i>I mean, I'm more bloated
than Vince Vaughn in The Break-Up...</i>

428
00:35:42,335 --> 00:35:44,769
<i>...or Vince Vaughn in Fred Claus...</i>

429
00:35:46,271 --> 00:35:48,239
...or I guess Vince Vaughn in general.

430
00:35:48,441 --> 00:35:51,137
- So let's go.
- Yeah, please.

431
00:35:53,545 --> 00:35:55,103
Lisa, come on.

432
00:35:55,313 --> 00:35:57,406
- No, guys.
- Come on, baby.

433
00:35:57,616 --> 00:35:59,584
I really have a bad feeling about this.

434
00:36:04,622 --> 00:36:06,112
Lisa!

435
00:36:06,325 --> 00:36:07,883
They killed Lisa!

436
00:36:08,092 --> 00:36:09,218
- Lisa!
- Come on, come on.

437
00:36:09,428 --> 00:36:12,522
- They killed Lisa! You bastards!
- Come on, come on. We gotta go.

438
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:14,254
Come on.

439
00:36:21,874 --> 00:36:24,775
I'm really sorry about your girlfriend,
home skillet.

440
00:36:24,975 --> 00:36:27,773
<i>Lo ciento about your main squeeze,
kemosabe.</i>

441
00:36:27,979 --> 00:36:33,815
I'd offer you my sexual favors, but
I've got a lot of mucus discharge lately.

442
00:36:34,017 --> 00:36:35,279
Lisa was a great girl.

443
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:47,519
Lisa who?

444
00:36:47,963 --> 00:36:49,260
Oh, where am I?

445
00:36:49,733 --> 00:36:52,133
Oh, what an enchanting place.

446
00:36:54,037 --> 00:36:57,097
It smells like meat and stress.

447
00:37:00,777 --> 00:37:01,835
Wonderful.

448
00:37:02,712 --> 00:37:04,179
What magical creature are you?

449
00:37:10,786 --> 00:37:12,253
<i>My dear prince</i>

450
00:37:12,455 --> 00:37:20,829
<i>You have rescued me
You've caught me in your arms</i>

451
00:37:21,031 --> 00:37:26,298
<i>Actually, you landed on my balls</i>

452
00:37:26,501 --> 00:37:27,832
Let me guess.

453
00:37:28,036 --> 00:37:32,029
An evil witch banished you
from your fairy-tale kingdom?

454
00:37:34,041 --> 00:37:36,509
No, my silly, pasty, quirky teen.

455
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:40,202
Actually, I'm just a demented
homeless chick who lives in the sewers.

456
00:37:41,349 --> 00:37:43,010
- How'd you end up there?
- Drugs.

457
00:37:43,217 --> 00:37:46,516
Lots and lots and lots...

458
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:51,350
...of mind-altering, enchanting drugs!

459
00:37:53,827 --> 00:37:55,852
I don't judge.

460
00:37:58,565 --> 00:38:00,123
It's dangerous out there.

461
00:38:00,334 --> 00:38:03,167
You might wanna come with us
if you wanna live.

462
00:38:03,369 --> 00:38:04,802
- Okay.
- All right.

463
00:38:05,004 --> 00:38:07,939
- Goodbye. Oh, I'm going with you.
- Yes, you are.

464
00:38:08,142 --> 00:38:11,009
The Natural History Museum
is just uptown. Let's go.

465
00:38:16,482 --> 00:38:20,851
<i>Dreams and fairy tales
My true love</i>

466
00:38:21,487 --> 00:38:26,390
<i>Talking squirrels and magic and stuff</i>

467
00:38:27,025 --> 00:38:29,926
No, princess, wait.
Where are you going?

468
00:38:30,129 --> 00:38:32,563
And who's that Moorish ruffian?

469
00:38:32,765 --> 00:38:35,063
I'm her new boyfriend. What it do?

470
00:38:36,601 --> 00:38:39,729
Very funny, dark peasant.
I'm Prince Edwin.

471
00:38:40,807 --> 00:38:44,140
- Princess, he your pimp?
- Oh, good heavens, yes.

472
00:38:46,178 --> 00:38:49,545
But that's all right.
I could have a pimp and a boyfriend.

473
00:38:50,449 --> 00:38:51,643
Oh, what to do?

474
00:38:54,052 --> 00:38:58,614
Whichever prince can vanquish
the other shall win my hand.

475
00:39:05,729 --> 00:39:06,821
You ready to step up?

476
00:39:08,299 --> 00:39:10,358
<i>Wait. You mean like
the first Step Up movie...</i>

477
00:39:10,568 --> 00:39:13,264
...where the street-dancer dude
went to the dance academy?

478
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:15,529
<i>No, I was thinking
more like Step Up 2...</i>

479
00:39:15,739 --> 00:39:18,640
...when the tough street-dancing chick
went to dancing academy.

480
00:39:19,542 --> 00:39:20,600
I feel you.

481
00:39:20,811 --> 00:39:24,645
He ain't ready for me. Juney, Will,
I'm about to break him down, baby.

482
00:39:24,848 --> 00:39:27,180
You want some? Well, here you go.

483
00:39:36,793 --> 00:39:38,522
Oh, a hoedown?

484
00:39:40,864 --> 00:39:41,853
It's crazy-shirt man.

485
00:39:47,069 --> 00:39:49,162
Oh, no, no, no.

486
00:39:54,376 --> 00:39:55,775
It's just my sleeve.

487
00:39:55,978 --> 00:39:58,003
Oh, come on.

488
00:39:58,915 --> 00:40:00,780
He's double-jointed.
Who cares about that?

489
00:40:03,218 --> 00:40:04,776
There must be a mirror somewhere.

490
00:40:07,455 --> 00:40:09,320
Make some room. Make some room.

491
00:40:09,524 --> 00:40:10,786
Make some room.

492
00:40:10,993 --> 00:40:13,484
- Come on, chubby.
- Okay.

493
00:40:15,097 --> 00:40:17,065
What? What? What?

494
00:40:17,566 --> 00:40:20,160
Oh, damn, that ho is all on point.

495
00:40:31,078 --> 00:40:33,842
That bitch better work.
She is off the chizzain.

496
00:40:34,047 --> 00:40:35,173
I think she's crowning.

497
00:40:38,052 --> 00:40:39,815
I want to dance.

498
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:43,388
I'm not sure I can though. I'm not sure.

499
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:46,559
L... Don't pressure me!

500
00:40:48,361 --> 00:40:49,988
I'm ready.

501
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:52,931
Oh, look out. Look at her coming in.

502
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,726
Oh, yeah.

503
00:41:37,376 --> 00:41:39,537
I'm out of here.

504
00:41:40,245 --> 00:41:41,473
Bye.

505
00:41:41,679 --> 00:41:44,113
She's all yours, bro.

506
00:41:44,715 --> 00:41:46,046
It's a twister!

507
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:48,445
Run! Run!

508
00:41:56,026 --> 00:41:58,153
Is there anyone that can save us?

509
00:41:58,362 --> 00:42:00,262
We need a hero.

510
00:42:08,405 --> 00:42:10,100
I am Iron Man.

511
00:42:12,709 --> 00:42:15,769
Oh, man! That twister shat out a cow.

512
00:42:17,247 --> 00:42:18,612
Shit. That's so messed up.

513
00:42:22,551 --> 00:42:24,985
Now you're pissing me off.

514
00:42:27,858 --> 00:42:30,349
I'm the only badass around here.

515
00:42:32,828 --> 00:42:34,523
Oh, damn!

516
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:36,425
Another cow?

517
00:42:43,171 --> 00:42:44,638
What was that?

518
00:42:44,839 --> 00:42:46,204
It's not nice.

519
00:42:46,408 --> 00:42:48,808
Look at me. Look at this.

520
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:50,602
It's a lobster claw.

521
00:42:50,812 --> 00:42:51,801
Whatever.

522
00:42:52,013 --> 00:42:55,608
Look, I'm carrying a lot of baggage.
I didn't need that, man.

523
00:42:59,487 --> 00:43:03,924
Don't make me angry.
You wouldn't like me when I'm angry.

524
00:43:04,391 --> 00:43:08,191
There's aspects of my personality
that I can't control.

525
00:43:26,045 --> 00:43:27,945
At least he didn't get hit with a cow.

526
00:43:30,684 --> 00:43:33,551
- Man!
- Hey, Casanova, forget Amy.

527
00:43:33,753 --> 00:43:35,653
We're never gonna make it
to the museum.

528
00:43:35,856 --> 00:43:37,187
I know she's still alive.

529
00:43:37,391 --> 00:43:39,655
<i>Hello? Jojo?</i>

530
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:42,420
Jojo? No, no, it's me.

531
00:43:42,628 --> 00:43:44,892
Will. Will, I'm trapped.

532
00:43:45,098 --> 00:43:48,693
<i>An Egyptian statue fell on me
during the earthquake.</i>

533
00:43:48,901 --> 00:43:51,062
<i>Stay calm, Amy. Just stay calm.</i>

534
00:43:51,270 --> 00:43:54,103
I'm so scared. I'm so scared.

535
00:43:54,306 --> 00:43:57,002
All right, Amy, listen to me. Don't panic.

536
00:43:59,946 --> 00:44:01,743
I will be there, I promise.

537
00:44:05,283 --> 00:44:07,513
Amy? Amy?

538
00:44:09,789 --> 00:44:11,950
Guys, I'm going back for her.

539
00:44:14,793 --> 00:44:18,729
You can't save her if you're dead!
Come on, let's go!

540
00:44:18,930 --> 00:44:20,761
- I'll be there as soon as I can.
- Go, go.

541
00:44:20,966 --> 00:44:22,058
Goodbye.

542
00:44:22,267 --> 00:44:23,461
- Amy. No!
- Will, let's go.

543
00:44:23,667 --> 00:44:25,362
- No! Damn it!
- You got to!

544
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,177
I know you think I'm crazy...

545
00:44:36,379 --> 00:44:39,246
...but these disasters have to do
with the crystal skull.

546
00:44:39,450 --> 00:44:42,908
- It's like TMTH.
- TM what?

547
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:45,247
Too much to handle.

548
00:44:45,656 --> 00:44:47,248
Bitch, why you don't just say that?

549
00:44:47,458 --> 00:44:50,120
Why everything a goddamn acronym
with you?

550
00:44:50,327 --> 00:44:53,319
Chilly Willy out, LL Not Cool J.

551
00:44:53,530 --> 00:44:57,398
Oh, do stop all of this quarreling.
Honestly.

552
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:00,160
Now, who's hungry?

553
00:45:08,645 --> 00:45:10,010
Delicious.

554
00:45:10,847 --> 00:45:12,610
Whatever.

555
00:45:13,982 --> 00:45:15,142
Would you like some?

556
00:45:15,617 --> 00:45:16,641
No.

557
00:45:23,825 --> 00:45:25,349
What?

558
00:45:25,928 --> 00:45:28,658
<i>Y'all, that's my Get Smart phone.
Just give me a minute.</i>

559
00:45:37,806 --> 00:45:39,831
You got poop.

560
00:45:40,342 --> 00:45:41,331
Just a smidge.

561
00:45:45,513 --> 00:45:48,346
Did I get it? Did I get it all?

562
00:45:49,952 --> 00:45:51,817
What y'all looking at me like that for?

563
00:45:52,019 --> 00:45:53,543
You got... Yeah.

564
00:45:54,155 --> 00:45:55,144
Is it right there?

565
00:45:55,990 --> 00:45:58,481
- It's fine.
- Just go:

566
00:45:58,859 --> 00:46:01,225
Just... I get it all the time, all over.

567
00:46:05,999 --> 00:46:07,626
What it do?

568
00:46:10,637 --> 00:46:14,129
Hey, y'all, it's Lisa's mom.

569
00:46:14,674 --> 00:46:17,165
I gotta tell her what happened
to her daughter.

570
00:46:22,147 --> 00:46:23,842
Hi, Miss Heller.

571
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:29,810
Lisa...

572
00:46:30,323 --> 00:46:31,915
Lisa dead.

573
00:46:34,393 --> 00:46:35,758
But booyah!

574
00:46:36,763 --> 00:46:40,199
I met this fine, hot
enchanted-princess chick...

575
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:43,892
...willing to do anything
and everything I want.

576
00:46:44,103 --> 00:46:46,230
You gotta talk to her. Talk to her.

577
00:46:46,472 --> 00:46:50,966
Hello? Oh, yes, he's right.
I will do anything. Truly.

578
00:46:51,176 --> 00:46:54,475
I'm not referred to on the street
as the Cavernous Princess for nothing.

579
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:57,740
A nomenclature well-deserved,
most assuredly.

580
00:46:57,950 --> 00:47:00,350
If you've got 5 bucks or some meth,
I'll show you.

581
00:47:00,552 --> 00:47:02,850
One time I hooked up
with a 1 -year-old wizard.

582
00:47:03,053 --> 00:47:06,682
His penis kept reappearing
in all sorts of different places.

583
00:47:06,891 --> 00:47:08,381
Never again.

584
00:47:08,593 --> 00:47:11,756
You're so cool.
We should totally hang out.

585
00:47:11,963 --> 00:47:13,760
<i>She's awesome.</i>

586
00:47:13,965 --> 00:47:16,126
Look, we gotta get to Amy
at the Natural History Museum.

587
00:47:20,505 --> 00:47:21,529
Oh, my.

588
00:47:21,972 --> 00:47:24,873
- Oh, no.
- I can't see anything.

589
00:47:25,108 --> 00:47:29,010
- Neither can I.
- Somebody is totally feeling me up.

590
00:47:29,213 --> 00:47:31,443
- Calvin.
- I didn't do it.

591
00:47:34,284 --> 00:47:37,117
They're so perky.
They're filled with milk.

592
00:47:39,624 --> 00:47:41,592
What the hell was that?

593
00:48:27,602 --> 00:48:31,333
Wonderful.
What adorable woodland creatures.

594
00:48:31,538 --> 00:48:35,030
I'm not merry, really. That didn't...
I mean, that didn't make me merry.

595
00:48:35,242 --> 00:48:38,268
I don't feel merry, I guess.

596
00:49:14,413 --> 00:49:15,744
Man, them guys are all right.

597
00:49:16,350 --> 00:49:17,977
That's cute. That's cute.

598
00:49:52,817 --> 00:49:56,878
Okay, you guys are not
Alvin and the Chipmunks, are you?

599
00:49:59,490 --> 00:50:00,855
I think that one's got rabies.

600
00:50:05,795 --> 00:50:07,490
Where you going, punk-ass?

601
00:50:10,668 --> 00:50:12,932
Alvin!

602
00:50:18,843 --> 00:50:20,538
Get him off!

603
00:50:20,743 --> 00:50:22,711
Chipmunks love nuts.

604
00:50:28,017 --> 00:50:31,384
Get him off! What the hell?
I thought you was my friend!

605
00:50:32,054 --> 00:50:33,043
Salty.

606
00:50:38,828 --> 00:50:41,820
You're hitting the wrong thing! You...!

607
00:50:48,438 --> 00:50:52,568
I feel left out.
No one's biting my flesh. Pooh.

608
00:50:56,879 --> 00:50:58,744
Is that the best you got, pussy?

609
00:51:02,717 --> 00:51:03,809
You are such a girl.

610
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:21,095
Redrum!

611
00:51:30,978 --> 00:51:32,775
Where'd he go?

612
00:51:41,254 --> 00:51:42,380
Yeah!

613
00:51:45,825 --> 00:51:47,622
Don't bite me. Get lost!

614
00:51:56,503 --> 00:51:58,664
Oh, boy, tasty vertebrae.

615
00:51:59,672 --> 00:52:00,900
- Juney.
- Let her go.

616
00:52:01,106 --> 00:52:02,971
Let her go, man.
Ain't nothing we can do.

617
00:52:03,175 --> 00:52:04,540
But she's still alive.

618
00:52:04,743 --> 00:52:06,108
They're munching me harder...

619
00:52:06,312 --> 00:52:10,510
<i>...than Rachael Ray chowing down
eggs Benedict on $40 a Day.</i>

620
00:52:10,715 --> 00:52:11,739
Yeah.

621
00:52:11,950 --> 00:52:16,319
Even when the bitch is dying,
she don't shut up with her witty repartee.

622
00:52:16,522 --> 00:52:20,219
Hey, BFFs, what's the 411 on the 911?

623
00:52:20,425 --> 00:52:22,723
Oh, she is rather annoying.

624
00:52:22,926 --> 00:52:26,919
WTH? I'm so not ROTFLOL'ing...

625
00:52:27,131 --> 00:52:32,228
...but please KIT, before I get 187'd.

626
00:52:33,504 --> 00:52:35,404
Blog you later.

627
00:52:36,541 --> 00:52:38,406
- Finally.
- Finally.

628
00:52:39,143 --> 00:52:41,873
That was just the amuse bouche.
Now the main course.

629
00:52:46,216 --> 00:52:48,582
- Come back here, you bitches.
- Bitches!

630
00:52:48,786 --> 00:52:50,845
I'll get you in your grill.

631
00:52:51,054 --> 00:52:52,578
Pussies.

632
00:52:52,788 --> 00:52:53,846
Die!

633
00:52:54,057 --> 00:52:57,458
Can't breathe. Need air.

634
00:52:59,463 --> 00:53:01,021
Shitheads!

635
00:53:08,238 --> 00:53:10,365
Is everybody okay?

636
00:53:10,574 --> 00:53:12,269
Yeah, I'm okay.

637
00:53:12,474 --> 00:53:16,035
Hey, baby, your knees
are all skinned up.

638
00:53:16,846 --> 00:53:19,406
Oh, yes, but that's not
from the chipmunks.

639
00:53:20,816 --> 00:53:23,148
But I do have this terrible headache.

640
00:53:24,819 --> 00:53:27,287
<i>Head On.
Apply directly to the forehead.</i>

641
00:53:27,489 --> 00:53:29,923
<i>Head On.
Apply directly to the forehead.</i>

642
00:53:30,126 --> 00:53:32,594
<i>Head On.
Apply directly to the forehead.</i>

643
00:53:32,794 --> 00:53:34,921
<i>Head On.
Apply directly to the forehead.</i>

644
00:53:35,130 --> 00:53:36,893
I just... I just did.

645
00:53:37,099 --> 00:53:38,566
<i>I said, Head On, bitch.</i>

646
00:53:38,768 --> 00:53:40,736
<i>- Apply directly to the forehead.
- Whatever.</i>

647
00:53:40,935 --> 00:53:42,425
<i>Don't cop an attitude, slut.</i>

648
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:46,197
<i>I said, apply Head On directly
to your goddamn forehead.</i>

649
00:53:46,408 --> 00:53:49,275
Okay, okay. Happy?

650
00:53:49,477 --> 00:53:51,502
<i>Look, you little white-trash
piece of shit...</i>

651
00:53:51,713 --> 00:53:52,873
<i>... Head On, motherfucker.</i>

652
00:53:53,081 --> 00:53:55,811
<i>Apply directly to your
motherfucking forehead.</i>

653
00:53:56,016 --> 00:53:59,110
Okay? There. It's all over.

654
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:03,916
Head on, face on, nose on, eyes on.

655
00:54:06,027 --> 00:54:07,756
Oh, that's great.

656
00:54:07,962 --> 00:54:09,327
My headache is gone...

657
00:54:09,531 --> 00:54:12,625
...but I still have that dreadful
yeast infection.

658
00:54:13,966 --> 00:54:15,365
Sourdough anyone?

659
00:54:16,136 --> 00:54:18,934
- I could've did without that.
- Let's get to the museum.

660
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:25,705
- Let's go!
- Move it!

661
00:54:25,913 --> 00:54:27,881
Out of the way!

662
00:54:36,355 --> 00:54:37,947
Excuse me, sir.

663
00:54:38,157 --> 00:54:40,182
What's going on?
Where's everybody going?

664
00:54:40,393 --> 00:54:43,521
It's a mass evacuation. Everyone
has to leave the city right now.

665
00:54:43,730 --> 00:54:45,493
Hold up, hold up.
You leaving, Batman?

666
00:54:45,698 --> 00:54:49,532
Shit. Yes. Yeah, I'm leaving. Okay?
I don't wanna die.

667
00:54:49,735 --> 00:54:51,828
Not on my schedule today.
Not on my to-do list.

668
00:54:52,037 --> 00:54:55,370
It wasn't, "Wake up, make breakfast, jog,
science experiment, die."

669
00:54:55,574 --> 00:54:59,567
Not on it. Not on it. Okay?
Are we done?

670
00:54:59,778 --> 00:55:01,143
All right.

671
00:55:01,812 --> 00:55:04,645
Anyone who stays in town
is gonna be buried in rubble.

672
00:55:04,850 --> 00:55:05,976
I hate rubble.

673
00:55:06,184 --> 00:55:09,847
I've gotta get to the Natural History
Museum, to my girl, Amy. She's trapped.

674
00:55:10,055 --> 00:55:13,491
If you go back after your girlfriend,
you have zero chance of survival.

675
00:55:13,791 --> 00:55:14,985
I'll take those odds.

676
00:55:17,862 --> 00:55:21,696
- She must be some piece of pussy.
- She is, sir. She is.

677
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:26,499
Look, the evacuation bus
is leaving city hall at 21 hours.

678
00:55:26,703 --> 00:55:29,467
Twenty-one hundred?
Hold on, what is...? That's...

679
00:55:29,673 --> 00:55:31,834
- Five, carry the six...
- Nine p.m.

680
00:55:32,041 --> 00:55:34,703
I'm gonna save you your crazy math.
It's 9 p.m.

681
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:37,209
You start at noon, then nine hours later.

682
00:55:37,414 --> 00:55:40,713
That's 9. That's the time you need
to get on those evacuation buses...

683
00:55:40,917 --> 00:55:42,407
...or you're dead.

684
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:44,087
Dead?

685
00:55:45,422 --> 00:55:47,583
Come on, it's already 5:30!

686
00:55:48,392 --> 00:55:50,724
Say again, 5:3? Oh, Jesus.

687
00:55:50,927 --> 00:55:53,452
Oh, God. I wasted the whole day.

688
00:55:53,663 --> 00:55:56,928
I was... I was on Amazon
looking for stuff.

689
00:55:57,132 --> 00:56:00,465
Shit. Why? Why would I
go Christmas shopping today?

690
00:56:01,136 --> 00:56:04,970
Why would I pick today?
Son of a bitch. Okay, plan B.

691
00:56:09,812 --> 00:56:11,143
- Hi.
- Hi.

692
00:56:11,346 --> 00:56:12,370
I'm Batman.

693
00:56:12,582 --> 00:56:14,379
I'm Enchanted Princess.

694
00:56:14,583 --> 00:56:17,177
True story: I had a woman one time...

695
00:56:17,387 --> 00:56:21,653
...tell me I was in the top four
best lovers she's ever had.

696
00:56:21,856 --> 00:56:23,255
That's a true story.

697
00:56:23,457 --> 00:56:25,084
And she had been around the block.

698
00:56:27,629 --> 00:56:31,725
Would you want to watch me
play with myself?

699
00:56:33,367 --> 00:56:34,356
Goodbye.

700
00:56:45,946 --> 00:56:47,436
Come on, let's go.

701
00:56:50,650 --> 00:56:51,947
Break yourself, fool.

702
00:56:52,152 --> 00:56:55,246
You best be getting out of that Mach 5
or I'll toe-tag your ass.

703
00:57:04,296 --> 00:57:06,491
You know, they say that the first kill...

704
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:08,497
...is supposed to be quite difficult.

705
00:57:08,702 --> 00:57:12,365
But I find it easy. In fact, rather fun.

706
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:16,138
Take it. Do it.

707
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:23,409
Look, Ma, no eyes.

708
00:57:23,616 --> 00:57:25,140
I didn't have a mother!

709
00:57:28,888 --> 00:57:31,857
That was better than sex with a camel.

710
00:57:43,301 --> 00:57:46,327
What? We're just playing
with my monkey.

711
00:57:50,942 --> 00:57:52,500
Let's roll.

712
00:57:56,014 --> 00:57:57,140
Oh, my!

713
00:58:09,394 --> 00:58:10,383
Come on!

714
00:58:12,729 --> 00:58:14,060
Run.

715
00:58:15,767 --> 00:58:17,564
We gotta keep going.

716
00:58:19,202 --> 00:58:22,069
These glass slippers
are awfully hard to run in.

717
00:58:30,246 --> 00:58:31,907
Help. Help.

718
00:58:32,716 --> 00:58:34,013
Amy.

719
00:58:36,119 --> 00:58:38,383
- You came back for me.
- I love you, Amy.

720
00:58:39,055 --> 00:58:41,956
I know. I love you too.

721
00:58:43,626 --> 00:58:45,924
Now get this freaking spear
out of my shoulder.

722
00:58:46,128 --> 00:58:47,117
Yeah.

723
00:58:48,064 --> 00:58:49,395
- Okay.
- It hurts.

724
00:58:49,597 --> 00:58:50,757
Okay. All right.

725
00:58:50,966 --> 00:58:52,957
She's pinned through to the floor, guys.

726
00:58:53,168 --> 00:58:55,932
This isn't gonna be easy.
Calvin, I'm gonna need your help.

727
00:58:56,138 --> 00:58:57,765
Right.

728
00:59:02,410 --> 00:59:05,345
- What was that for?
- I was trying to knock her unconscious...

729
00:59:05,547 --> 00:59:06,912
...so she wouldn't feel pain.

730
00:59:08,183 --> 00:59:09,810
Good thinking.

731
00:59:10,418 --> 00:59:13,785
- Baby, this is for your own good.
- Okay.

732
00:59:21,161 --> 00:59:25,461
Man, you hit like a pussy. Let me try.

733
00:59:33,107 --> 00:59:34,768
Man, this girl can take a hit.

734
00:59:43,816 --> 00:59:45,579
Why?

735
00:59:47,121 --> 00:59:49,521
It's not working.
Let's just pull it out of her.

736
00:59:51,223 --> 00:59:52,212
On the count of three.

737
00:59:52,426 --> 00:59:54,860
One, two, three.

738
00:59:55,061 --> 00:59:56,494
Good job.

739
01:00:08,341 --> 01:00:10,935
We gotta get out of here.
This place is gonna collapse.

740
01:00:11,510 --> 01:00:16,971
No. Not until we return this...

741
01:00:17,949 --> 01:00:19,473
...back to the altar.

742
01:00:19,985 --> 01:00:21,714
A magic bong.

743
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:24,753
The crystal skull.
The one from my dreams.

744
01:00:24,956 --> 01:00:29,359
Now, legend has it that if the
crystal skull is missing from the altar...

745
01:00:29,561 --> 01:00:31,722
...it's the end of the world.
Earthquakes...

746
01:00:31,930 --> 01:00:34,455
...asteroids, return of the Spice Girls.

747
01:00:34,666 --> 01:00:35,792
Yes!

748
01:00:37,402 --> 01:00:38,391
The apocalypse.

749
01:00:38,602 --> 01:00:41,127
And you know this shit
because you're the docent?

750
01:00:41,337 --> 01:00:43,999
<i>I saw Indiana Jones and the Kingdom
of the Crystal Skull.</i>

751
01:00:44,208 --> 01:00:45,800
Do you know what this means?

752
01:00:46,011 --> 01:00:48,878
Me dreaming about the skull,
and you knowing about the skull?

753
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:52,675
- That we were destined to be together?
- No, that we both really love skulls.

754
01:00:53,783 --> 01:00:55,478
But that too.

755
01:00:57,122 --> 01:00:59,647
Will, we gotta get out of here.
It's almost 9 o'clock.

756
01:00:59,857 --> 01:01:03,054
If we don't make it to them
evacuation buses, we're gonna die.

757
01:01:05,362 --> 01:01:06,761
Go, Calvin.

758
01:01:06,964 --> 01:01:09,990
I'm staying here with Amy.
We're returning the skull to the altar.

759
01:01:11,936 --> 01:01:13,597
- See you.
- Nice meeting you.

760
01:01:14,138 --> 01:01:16,231
Let's find that altar.

761
01:01:44,233 --> 01:01:45,222
What's happening?

762
01:01:45,433 --> 01:01:48,698
Everything in the museum
is coming to life.

763
01:01:51,305 --> 01:01:52,932
Hell, no!

764
01:01:54,176 --> 01:01:55,404
Bully! Bully!

765
01:01:56,979 --> 01:01:58,139
Yes!

766
01:02:02,049 --> 01:02:04,779
- Let's get the hell up out of here.
- Drugs are great.

767
01:02:09,356 --> 01:02:12,325
- The altar to the crystal skull is this way.
- Okay.

768
01:02:18,499 --> 01:02:20,262
I am Beowulf.

769
01:02:24,971 --> 01:02:26,165
Hello.

770
01:02:28,842 --> 01:02:30,104
What?

771
01:02:31,379 --> 01:02:32,641
I am Beowulf.

772
01:02:34,381 --> 01:02:36,781
- Can you put some clothes on?
- I am Beowulf.

773
01:02:36,983 --> 01:02:40,817
I fought the monster Grendel with
no armor, and that is how I'll fight you.

774
01:02:41,721 --> 01:02:43,188
Wait. You fight naked?

775
01:02:46,258 --> 01:02:47,247
I am Beowulf.

776
01:02:47,459 --> 01:02:48,653
That's kind of gay, bro.

777
01:02:49,161 --> 01:02:51,129
It's not... It's not gay. It's...

778
01:02:51,331 --> 01:02:53,265
No, I'm sorry. That's gay.

779
01:02:53,465 --> 01:02:55,296
It's not gay. It's not.

780
01:02:55,501 --> 01:02:59,130
It's how we do it in 57, dick.

781
01:02:59,338 --> 01:03:02,205
- Ask anybody.
- All right, I will. I'll ask my friend Paul.

782
01:03:02,407 --> 01:03:05,535
We're boating tomorrow.
I'll ask him when we're out in the seas.

783
01:03:06,177 --> 01:03:09,510
- Paul?
- My friend Paul, who is my partner.

784
01:03:11,048 --> 01:03:13,539
He's my friend. We're also partners.

785
01:03:14,586 --> 01:03:17,316
- Life partner?
- No, business partners.

786
01:03:17,523 --> 01:03:20,356
We opened an antique shop together.

787
01:03:20,557 --> 01:03:22,320
- That's gay.
- Why is that gay?

788
01:03:22,527 --> 01:03:25,894
Why are antiques gay? Because
I like old things that are kitschy?

789
01:03:28,132 --> 01:03:29,861
I'm Beowulf!

790
01:03:30,300 --> 01:03:33,633
Excuse me, are you ready
to get your ass kicked?

791
01:03:39,976 --> 01:03:43,844
Oh, hell, no, Kung Fu Panda.

792
01:03:44,548 --> 01:03:47,039
You shouldn't have done that.

793
01:03:53,090 --> 01:03:55,684
Get ready to feel the thunder.

794
01:04:24,119 --> 01:04:25,950
Your girl looks familiar, man.

795
01:04:26,155 --> 01:04:30,854
Last year, I paid her 20 bucks
for 20 minutes, if you know what I mean.

796
01:04:31,193 --> 01:04:33,753
It's true. And a curious factoid:

797
01:04:33,962 --> 01:04:37,193
Pandas actually have
three descending testicles.

798
01:04:38,999 --> 01:04:40,557
That's it.

799
01:05:33,419 --> 01:05:34,784
Oh, shit.

800
01:05:42,728 --> 01:05:44,855
Oh, wonderful job.

801
01:05:47,666 --> 01:05:52,797
<i>My dear prince
You have defended my honor</i>

802
01:05:53,705 --> 01:05:55,400
Kiss me, baby.

803
01:06:18,295 --> 01:06:21,731
- You a dude?
- I'm a trannie. I thought you knew.

804
01:06:22,933 --> 01:06:24,400
No.

805
01:06:35,412 --> 01:06:36,640
Get him, Will.

806
01:06:37,447 --> 01:06:39,915
- I am Beowulf.
- Yeah, I know already.

807
01:06:40,115 --> 01:06:42,675
Surrender so we can go get brunch.

808
01:06:42,886 --> 01:06:46,151
<i>And I got us tickets to Jersey Boys.</i>

809
01:06:46,389 --> 01:06:47,913
No.

810
01:07:00,067 --> 01:07:01,261
We can go to my place.

811
01:07:01,470 --> 01:07:05,304
<i>I TiVo'd Dancing with the Stars,
results show.</i>

812
01:07:05,507 --> 01:07:07,372
- No!
- Beowulf!

813
01:07:09,243 --> 01:07:11,939
I wanna take you
on Rosie O'Donnell's cruise.

814
01:07:12,147 --> 01:07:15,605
Just me, you,
and my dear friend George Takei.

815
01:07:16,118 --> 01:07:17,608
Screw this.

816
01:07:18,053 --> 01:07:20,351
I'm Beowulf!

817
01:07:21,622 --> 01:07:24,352
Beowulf out.

818
01:07:28,029 --> 01:07:29,587
Hurry, we're running out of time.

819
01:08:01,694 --> 01:08:03,286
Indiana Jones?

820
01:08:06,266 --> 01:08:07,665
Indiana, my ass.

821
01:08:09,401 --> 01:08:10,629
I'll take it from here.

822
01:08:17,143 --> 01:08:20,579
Thanks, son.
That's right, I'm your father.

823
01:08:22,714 --> 01:08:25,683
- You're my dad?
- Your mom got around.

824
01:08:25,885 --> 01:08:28,752
- A real slut, actually.
- Right, I get it.

825
01:08:28,953 --> 01:08:30,443
She did this special thing...

826
01:08:30,656 --> 01:08:34,683
...with her big toe and candle wax...
- Okay.

827
01:08:34,894 --> 01:08:36,987
I'm sorry I walked out
on you and your mother.

828
01:08:37,195 --> 01:08:39,095
But I got an adventurous spirit...

829
01:08:39,297 --> 01:08:41,993
...and a hot-ass whore
in every major city.

830
01:08:43,635 --> 01:08:45,159
What do we have here?

831
01:08:45,370 --> 01:08:46,837
Is this your girl?

832
01:08:47,038 --> 01:08:50,269
- Yeah.
- What a nice young lady.

833
01:08:50,475 --> 01:08:52,272
And you got some shape on you.

834
01:08:52,476 --> 01:08:54,808
Yeah, baby. You're so nice.

835
01:08:55,012 --> 01:08:58,311
- And you got some ass on you.
- Dad.

836
01:08:58,515 --> 01:09:00,676
- Oh, so beautiful.
- Dad.

837
01:09:00,885 --> 01:09:04,787
If a nice ass meant a hamburger,
baby, you'd have a Whopper.

838
01:09:04,988 --> 01:09:06,387
- Oh, shit.
- Dad.

839
01:09:06,590 --> 01:09:10,321
Do you do Pilates?
I'm just asking. Just asking.

840
01:09:13,797 --> 01:09:16,698
Don't do what your old man did.
Settle down.

841
01:09:18,267 --> 01:09:20,132
Hell, I got gonorrhea so many times...

842
01:09:20,337 --> 01:09:22,396
...my johnson looked like a melted
Baby Ruth.

843
01:09:23,873 --> 01:09:27,468
Hell, in the '7s, my nickname was
Chlamydia Jones.

844
01:09:28,844 --> 01:09:33,008
There is no cure for herpes,
and I bullshit you not.

845
01:09:33,816 --> 01:09:35,545
Thanks, Dad.

846
01:09:57,872 --> 01:10:00,705
- This looks easy.
- Not as easy as it used to be.

847
01:10:04,945 --> 01:10:07,277
Oh, shit, my hip.

848
01:10:12,419 --> 01:10:15,411
- You know I gotta get my hustle on.
- Bye, Dad.

849
01:10:17,825 --> 01:10:18,985
I'm gonna make it.

850
01:10:19,192 --> 01:10:20,784
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

851
01:10:20,995 --> 01:10:22,257
Oh, shit!

852
01:10:25,366 --> 01:10:28,199
That hurts. Oh, shit!

853
01:10:55,528 --> 01:11:00,659
Why don't you just walk to the altar?
It's like 10 feet away.

854
01:11:01,667 --> 01:11:03,498
Silly girl.

855
01:11:10,842 --> 01:11:13,936
No, don't cry. I'll be fine.

856
01:12:00,790 --> 01:12:02,451
I am the Guru Shitka.

857
01:12:02,660 --> 01:12:06,289
And we are here today
to bring together Amy and Will...

858
01:12:06,497 --> 01:12:09,432
...in a union of peace and happiness.

859
01:12:09,631 --> 01:12:15,467
And to point out, gee,
Amy, you are totally hot. TM.

860
01:12:17,506 --> 01:12:19,064
Amy, do you take Will...

861
01:12:19,274 --> 01:12:22,971
...to be your peanut butter and jelly
that goes into your love belly?

862
01:12:23,178 --> 01:12:24,202
I do.

863
01:12:24,413 --> 01:12:28,816
And, Will, do you take Amy
to be your doughnut of love...

864
01:12:29,016 --> 01:12:32,008
...that you'll fill with cream every day?

865
01:12:32,221 --> 01:12:33,210
I do.

866
01:12:36,425 --> 01:12:39,724
Well, in that case, give her a pound.

867
01:12:40,661 --> 01:12:42,754
Lock it down.

868
01:12:43,132 --> 01:12:44,997
Break the pickle.

869
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:46,560
Now, tickle my pickle.

870
01:12:55,843 --> 01:12:56,832
I love you, Will.

871
01:12:57,044 --> 01:12:59,103
I love you too, Amy.

872
01:12:59,412 --> 01:13:01,846
But there's something I should tell you.

873
01:13:02,950 --> 01:13:03,939
What is it?

874
01:13:16,730 --> 01:13:17,958
<i>I'm fucking Matt Damon</i>

875
01:13:18,632 --> 01:13:20,964
You're fucking Matt Damon?

876
01:13:21,168 --> 01:13:22,692
<i>Well, I'm fucking Hannah Montana</i>

877
01:13:22,903 --> 01:13:24,302
<i>She's fucking Hannah Montana</i>

878
01:13:24,505 --> 01:13:28,100
<i>Backstage at my concert
Fucks me on my parents' bed</i>

879
01:13:28,307 --> 01:13:31,367
<i>After school, at my locker,
In the car I give her head</i>

880
01:13:31,577 --> 01:13:33,101
<i>I'm also fucking the Flava</i>

881
01:13:33,312 --> 01:13:35,780
<i>Yeah, boy
She's fucking Flava-Flav, fool</i>

882
01:13:35,982 --> 01:13:38,780
<i>You know what time it is
Because I'm fucking Juney too</i>

883
01:13:39,852 --> 01:13:43,288
<i>Yeah, I know, but it's true
Flava-Flav, he fucks me too</i>

884
01:13:43,489 --> 01:13:46,754
<i>And I swap with Calvin
And he swaps with that dude</i>

885
01:13:46,959 --> 01:13:48,392
<i>And we're all fucking Hellboy</i>

886
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:54,928
<i>Yeah, they're fucking Hellboy
And I'm fucking the Hulk</i>

887
01:13:55,134 --> 01:13:58,501
<i>When I get really mad
I start fucking Iron Man</i>

888
01:13:58,702 --> 01:14:01,899
<i>A most uncomfortable screw
But I fuck the princess too</i>

889
01:14:03,608 --> 01:14:05,473
<i>Who's that ringing on my bell?</i>

890
01:14:05,677 --> 01:14:07,440
<i>The bitch who's fucking Iron Man</i>

891
01:14:07,645 --> 01:14:12,412
<i>That's l-R-O-N M-A-N
And I fuck him in the mouth</i>

892
01:14:12,617 --> 01:14:16,109
<i>That's fucking great
Because I'm fucking Wolf</i>

893
01:14:18,555 --> 01:14:20,216
<i>He's fucking Wolf
Ain't that a pity?</i>

894
01:14:20,424 --> 01:14:23,757
<i>Because I'm fucking those bitches
From Sex and the City</i>

895
01:14:25,162 --> 01:14:28,131
<i>He fucks the Sex and the City gals</i>

896
01:14:28,332 --> 01:14:31,130
So I wondered:
Would Wolf really get jealous...

897
01:14:31,334 --> 01:14:34,326
...if he knew we were fucking
that guy with the big utility belt?

898
01:14:35,939 --> 01:14:37,167
<i>They're all fucking Batman</i>

899
01:14:37,374 --> 01:14:40,571
<i>At Wayne Manor, in the Batcave
Butler Alfred is our love slave</i>

900
01:14:40,776 --> 01:14:42,471
<i>Riddle me this
Holy bathhouse</i>

901
01:14:42,679 --> 01:14:44,169
<i>I'm fucking Amy Winehouse?</i>

902
01:14:44,381 --> 01:14:47,680
<i>He's fucking Amy Winehouse</i>

903
01:14:47,884 --> 01:14:50,478
<i>Yeah, on the down-low, low, low</i>

904
01:14:50,686 --> 01:14:53,621
<i>And I'm fucking Jessica Simpson</i>

905
01:14:54,358 --> 01:14:57,521
<i>'Cause I'm on blow, blow, blow</i>

906
01:14:57,726 --> 01:15:01,685
<i>She's fucking Jessica Simpson
Oh, yeah</i>

907
01:15:01,898 --> 01:15:05,925
<i>And I think I might have fucked
That hot assassin</i>

908
01:15:06,135 --> 01:15:09,298
<i>Everyone's fucked me
And I've fucked them back, you see</i>

909
01:15:09,504 --> 01:15:12,837
<i>And the Mexican too
With the tragic hairdo</i>

910
01:15:13,275 --> 01:15:16,210
<i>Call it, heads, I'm fucking J. T.</i>

911
01:15:16,411 --> 01:15:19,346
<i>I'm fucking that male model
'Cause he's so fine</i>

912
01:15:19,547 --> 01:15:22,675
<i>And I like to get up
In them Calvin Kleins</i>

913
01:15:22,884 --> 01:15:29,255
<i>It's true, J. T. Fucked my ass again
But I'm also fucking Prince Caspian</i>

914
01:15:29,791 --> 01:15:32,988
<i>I am handsome and I am cool</i>

915
01:15:33,194 --> 01:15:36,391
<i>That's why this prince
Fucks the kids from high school</i>

916
01:15:40,267 --> 01:15:41,757
<i>- Come on
- Let's hear it</i>

917
01:15:41,970 --> 01:15:43,904
<i>- Now's the time to party
- Let me hear you</i>

918
01:15:44,105 --> 01:15:46,266
<i>- You know what time it is?
- No, what time is it?</i>

919
01:15:46,473 --> 01:15:48,407
<i>- It's time to get fucked
- Fuck me</i>

920
01:15:48,609 --> 01:15:50,668
<i>- No, fuck me
- Fuck me</i>

921
01:15:50,878 --> 01:15:52,812
<i>He fucks all us kids in high school</i>

922
01:15:53,013 --> 01:15:56,949
<i>Under the bleachers, in the showers
While we're changing for gym class</i>

923
01:15:57,150 --> 01:15:58,981
<i>- I'm fucking Oprah
- I'm fucking Obama</i>

924
01:15:59,186 --> 01:16:01,279
<i>I'm fucking Indiana's ass</i>

925
01:16:01,487 --> 01:16:05,446
<i>She's fucking Indiana
And I'm fucking Hancock</i>

926
01:16:05,658 --> 01:16:09,219
<i>He's fucking Hancock
And I'm fucking Beowulf</i>

927
01:16:09,429 --> 01:16:12,887
<i>You know you like it
And I'm fucking Kung Fu Panda</i>

928
01:16:13,099 --> 01:16:15,590
<i>And I'm fucking Michael Jackson</i>

929
01:16:17,003 --> 01:16:20,029
<i>Don't judge me
I love my animals, you see</i>

930
01:16:20,238 --> 01:16:21,967
<i>Oh, yeah, he's fucking the Chipmunks</i>

931
01:16:22,174 --> 01:16:25,735
<i>Sad to say, but it's true
He fucks the Chipmunks, yeah</i>

932
01:18:51,951 --> 01:18:53,578
You just got Wolfed.

933
01:18:53,787 --> 01:18:56,688
That's a little move I learned in jail.

934
01:18:56,889 --> 01:18:58,288
Yeah, I was in jail.

935
01:18:58,491 --> 01:19:01,051
Wolf wrote some bad checks in '95.

936
01:19:01,260 --> 01:19:03,387
Left foot, yellow.

937
01:19:04,731 --> 01:19:06,096
Oh, that's right, I fall.

938
01:19:12,071 --> 01:19:15,097
Sorry about that. This is mine.
Sorry. I'm sorry.

939
01:19:15,774 --> 01:19:20,074
Wait. Oh, this is my jam.

940
01:19:20,279 --> 01:19:22,839
Oh, okay. You get on it.

941
01:19:23,281 --> 01:19:24,543
I am Beowulf.

942
01:19:24,750 --> 01:19:28,345
I'm the strongest man
in seven kingdoms.

943
01:19:30,121 --> 01:19:32,646
Let myself go a little bit.

944
01:19:32,857 --> 01:19:34,722
Got a little bit flabby.

945
01:19:34,926 --> 01:19:36,826
I went on that Zone Diet...

946
01:19:37,028 --> 01:19:41,795
...but I would eat like a whole week's
worth of meals in like two days...

947
01:19:41,999 --> 01:19:43,591
...and then be back to square one.

948
01:19:43,801 --> 01:19:47,828
If you've got crack anywhere,
I don't care where it comes from...

949
01:19:48,038 --> 01:19:51,496
If it's in your crack...
If the crack's in your crack.

950
01:19:53,076 --> 01:19:56,341
"If the crack's in your crack."
Oh, that's rich.

951
01:19:56,713 --> 01:19:58,738
You ever been
with a bald doctor before?

952
01:19:58,949 --> 01:20:01,042
- No.
- We give better...

953
01:20:03,085 --> 01:20:05,212
Do I look like Harrison Ford to you?

954
01:20:05,422 --> 01:20:07,617
- He your pimp?
- Oh, good heavens, yes.

955
01:20:11,428 --> 01:20:13,794
Oh, what to do? Yes, I've got it.

956
01:20:13,997 --> 01:20:17,455
You can be my prince of light,
and you can be my prince of darkness.

957
01:20:17,667 --> 01:20:19,498
- Yes. No? Okay.
- No.

958
01:20:20,435 --> 01:20:22,562
Left foot, yellow.

959
01:20:24,006 --> 01:20:25,769
Look at this onion.

960
01:20:25,975 --> 01:20:29,968
Baby, how did you get into it with him.
You should be with me.

961
01:20:30,178 --> 01:20:34,046
Also, when I make love to a girl,
she's also been Wolfed.

962
01:20:34,250 --> 01:20:39,745
I don't hit her with a stick,
I just have sex with her.

963
01:20:39,955 --> 01:20:42,082
Or him. Doesn't matter.

964
01:20:42,290 --> 01:20:44,485
Wolf goes both ways,
you know what I'm saying?

965
01:20:44,693 --> 01:20:47,127
I got us tickets
to Madonna's reunion show...

966
01:20:47,328 --> 01:20:49,523
...and then I wanna
kiss your sweet face.

967
01:20:49,731 --> 01:20:51,460
No!

968
01:20:52,666 --> 01:20:54,759
Take it from the top again.
She says, "Hello."

969
01:20:54,970 --> 01:20:57,768
Don't hit her so hard.
Just hit her really lightly.

970
01:20:57,972 --> 01:20:59,405
Okay?

971
01:21:00,107 --> 01:21:01,506
Good enough for me.

972
01:21:03,245 --> 01:21:04,974
It's all very funny.

973
01:21:05,780 --> 01:21:07,247
Cut.

974
01:21:07,915 --> 01:21:11,646
Oh, it's my Blake, incarcerated.
Hi, Blakey.

975
01:21:11,852 --> 01:21:14,252
How are you? I love you.

976
01:21:14,455 --> 01:21:16,286
He did not kill those three prostitutes.

977
01:21:16,490 --> 01:21:20,483
They were already dead when he
got to them. I'm swearing to God.

978
01:21:20,995 --> 01:21:24,021
Look, I have to tell you something.
I'm not really a banker.

979
01:21:24,231 --> 01:21:25,858
As my voice cracks.

980
01:21:26,066 --> 01:21:31,129
Look, I have something to tell you.
I'm not really a banker. I'm a jumper.

981
01:21:31,337 --> 01:21:34,704
I can teleport through space and time.

982
01:21:38,043 --> 01:21:40,409
- What is it again? Time and space.
- Time and space.

983
01:21:40,814 --> 01:21:42,406
Look, I have something to tell you.

984
01:21:42,615 --> 01:21:44,810
I'm not really a banker. I'm a jumper.

985
01:21:45,018 --> 01:21:47,987
- A what?
- I can teleport through time...

986
01:21:54,394 --> 01:21:55,725
You're a talking panda.

987
01:21:55,927 --> 01:21:59,454
Come back to my magical kingdom,
and I'll show you my talking beaver.

988
01:21:59,965 --> 01:22:01,865
It just keeps coming.

989
01:22:02,067 --> 01:22:05,901
Knock, knock. Who's there?
Milk in your mouth.

990
01:22:11,810 --> 01:22:18,648
Hey, is my singing stick on?
It is on? Is the singing stick on?

991
01:22:21,352 --> 01:22:24,651
You know, everyone wants to know
where I got my:

992
01:22:24,855 --> 01:22:27,915
It all started one night
when I was crying in my truck.

993
01:22:28,125 --> 01:22:31,026
Yeah. I ain't crying no more, man.

994
01:22:31,228 --> 01:22:33,219
Fourteenth highest-rated show on TV.

995
01:22:33,431 --> 01:22:36,332
I got a time-share in Key West.

996
01:22:37,033 --> 01:22:41,299
<i>Oh, baby, I make shoes</i>

997
01:22:41,504 --> 01:22:45,372
<i>And these are my boobs</i>

998
01:22:45,575 --> 01:22:47,805
I want you to see me
in my birthday suit.

999
01:22:48,011 --> 01:22:50,241
I want you to watch me
take a bubble bath.

1000
01:22:50,448 --> 01:22:53,315
I'm gonna play around with the bubbles
and make a little beard.

1001
01:22:53,516 --> 01:22:55,450
Pretend I'm Santa Claus.

1002
01:22:56,819 --> 01:22:59,515
Oh, son, I'm loving this.

1003
01:22:59,888 --> 01:23:03,324
Hang on a bit.
You're a bit of stuff, aren't you?

1004
01:23:03,526 --> 01:23:06,586
Look at you.
What are you packing under there?

1005
01:23:06,795 --> 01:23:08,319
What are you hiding under that?

1006
01:23:08,530 --> 01:23:11,397
I can see your sausage and biscuits.

1007
01:23:12,735 --> 01:23:14,259
I love sausage and biscuits.

1008
01:23:27,482 --> 01:23:29,279
Wonderful!

1009
01:23:30,352 --> 01:23:32,445
I'd like to get you naked
and analyze you.

1010
01:23:32,653 --> 01:23:34,780
Oh, shit.

1011
01:23:34,989 --> 01:23:37,389
Do you like this shirt?
I totally made it myself.

1012
01:23:37,591 --> 01:23:40,185
Well, it's because I ripped it.
It's because I burned it.

1013
01:23:40,395 --> 01:23:42,090
I was leaning over my birthday candles.

1014
01:23:42,296 --> 01:23:44,025
I was gonna blow them out,
make a wish.

1015
01:23:44,232 --> 01:23:45,859
Instead my shirt caught on fire.

1016
01:23:46,299 --> 01:23:49,996
Son, if you go back for your girlfriend,
you have zero chance of survival.

1017
01:23:50,338 --> 01:23:52,306
I'll take those odds.

1018
01:23:53,508 --> 01:23:55,442
Do you hear that train?

1019
01:23:57,811 --> 01:24:01,542
Son, if you go back for your girlfriend,
you have zero chance of survival.

1020
01:24:01,748 --> 01:24:03,409
I'll take those odds.

1021
01:24:03,618 --> 01:24:06,815
You hear that train again?
You hear that again, that second time?

1022
01:24:07,220 --> 01:24:10,986
Son, if you go back for your girlfriend,
you have zero chance of survival.

1023
01:24:11,425 --> 01:24:12,483
I'll take those...

1024
01:24:12,692 --> 01:24:15,160
Train. I knew it was coming too. Yeah.

1025
01:24:15,361 --> 01:24:19,161
- Is that the train we should catch?
- No, no. Take a...

1026
01:24:21,867 --> 01:24:22,856
Couple more?

1027
01:24:23,069 --> 01:24:25,936
You're hot. Are those things real?

1028
01:24:27,940 --> 01:24:32,138
Hey, everybody, be sure to remember
to always use Proactiv. It helped me.

<i>It helped my skin
It helped my skin</i>

1030
01:24:37,215 --> 01:24:42,881
<i>It helped my skin
It helped my skin, baby</i>

1031
01:24:43,088 --> 01:24:46,455
It helped me. I used to have it
all around this part of my face...

1032
01:24:46,658 --> 01:24:48,455
...and all around my talking hole...

1033
01:24:48,660 --> 01:24:52,118
...and then out of this squishy part
right here.

1034
01:24:52,330 --> 01:24:54,821
I had it everywhere, and now it's gone.

1035
01:24:55,033 --> 01:25:00,164
There's a medical term
