1
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:12,934
Go that way. Move that way.

2
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:03,748
Back!

3
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:29,777
- Yeah?
- This is the ghost...

4
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:32,943
of Christmas past.

5
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:34,987
- Michael?
- Dad, we're stranded.

6
00:02:35,054 --> 00:02:37,750
The cab broke down
on the way from J.F.K.

7
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:38,916
Are you all right?

8
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,186
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

9
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,728
We're on the Belt Parkway.

10
00:02:42,795 --> 00:02:43,921
Where are you exactly?

11
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,295
Exit ten, I think.

12
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:48,061
- Exit ten?
- Yeah.

13
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:50,193
All right, stay there.
I'll take care of it.

14
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,464
Gre--

15
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:56,868
Shit!

16
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,620
What the f--

17
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:13,656
Jesus. Tony!

18
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,025
Yes, sir, Captain.

19
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:17,926
I told you no
flying lobster this year.

20
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:19,521
I don't need the visibility.

21
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,965
My secretary didn't
give me the memo.

22
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,299
Mikey's stuck
on the Belt Parkway, exit ten.

23
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,462
Pick him up.

24
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:26,630
- Jamal!
- Yes, sir.

25
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:29,641
Tommy!
Take this damn thing down!

26
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,093
Honey?

27
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:53,291
Justin.

28
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:57,359
Did you do this?

29
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:58,904
Do what?

30
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:02,908
Aimee's in her snowsuit.

31
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:04,204
Her what?

32
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:09,845
Mom.

33
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:13,879
Mom.

34
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:15,648
Were you planning on
taking Aimee somewhere...

35
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:17,349
in her little snowsuit?

36
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,118
Yeah. I'm bringing her over
to Aunt Cathy's.

37
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:20,420
Why?

38
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:22,120
Well, we've got
that court thing tonight.

39
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:23,856
You can't bring a baby to court.

40
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,591
You're going to the auction too.

41
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:26,859
Yes.

42
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,628
OK.

43
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:30,464
Does that mean I'm picking
Michael up from J.F.K.?

44
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:32,697
No. He said he was
gonna take a taxi.

45
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,535
All right. Thank God.
We don't want to do that.

46
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:37,132
Honey, why don't you put her
in the seat and tell Justin...

47
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,144
- to move his truck, will you?
- All right.

48
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:53,992
Shit.

49
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,618
We lost the water!

50
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:46,507
Mikey, give the door a big bang.

51
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:48,945
You got to push it off.

52
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,006
I got-- there you-- I got it.

53
00:05:52,051 --> 00:05:53,541
Your dad's putting up
the balloon today?

54
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:55,086
Oh, no.

55
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:58,747
I got it. No.

56
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:02,454
The lobster aliens, they were
trying to send up a signal...

57
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,655
but the government,
they shot it down.

58
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:06,164
The lobster aliens?

59
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:09,030
Yeah. The lobster aliens.

60
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:10,194
Their mother ship
is right here...

61
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:12,328
and they're gonna take
them back home.

62
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:17,241
That's the least
of your problems.

63
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:20,643
When they get here,
they're gonna boil you alive.

64
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:23,640
Let's go take a nap.

65
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:25,946
Yeah. Go ahead.
There you go.

66
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:27,610
All right?

67
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:29,587
Watch out.

68
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:31,714
Is your phone OK?

69
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:35,090
No. Actually I think
it's completely screwed.

70
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:37,721
- Let me carry this.
- No. I got it.

71
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:38,889
No. Come on.
You're carrying too mu--

72
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:40,057
- Babe, I got it.
- Just let me car--

73
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:41,930
- I go--
- Hey, Mike?

74
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:43,935
- Yeah.
- How am I getting home?

75
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:45,766
I'll take you.

76
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:49,865
Let me just check in
with Captain Insanity first.

77
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:51,569
You don't have my purse, do y--

78
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:53,043
No.

79
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:54,875
I'm-- OK. I'm just--
it's in the van.

80
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:56,505
- I'll be right back.
- OK.

81
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:01,783
That's right. Ice them up.

82
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:03,981
They'll live at least
one more day.

83
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:08,653
Come on.

84
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:13,156
You'll have to dump them.

85
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:14,358
Hey, Mike, are you?
It's good to see you.

86
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,958
Good to see you.

87
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:19,998
They're all banded, right?

88
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:21,733
Yes, sir. All of them.

89
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:24,470
I got it.

90
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:27,040
Welcome home, Tiger.

91
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,512
Hey, Dad.

92
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:30,276
- Mikey, boy.
- What's up, fellas?

93
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:32,340
- What's up, man?
- How you doing?

94
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:33,578
Giorgio.

95
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:37,522
I lost my water this morning.
Broken pipes...

96
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,956
so I can't fill orders
till tomorrow.

97
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:44,519
I told you. I lost my water.

98
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:48,124
My fucking shop's
crawling with bugs.

99
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:51,466
Yeah? How's this for an idea?

100
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:53,801
How about you go shit
in your hat?

101
00:07:55,875 --> 00:08:00,312
The lobsters were so excited
you were coming home...

102
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:03,507
that they all jumped right out
of the tanks this m--

103
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:09,180
It's good to see you, pal.

104
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:10,813
Good to see you, Dad.

105
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:18,355
So when's the auction?

106
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:23,596
We go to court 5:30 tonight,
but it'll be fine.

107
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:26,001
I don't want you
to worry about it.

108
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:27,403
Don't worry?

109
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:32,410
Listen. I created a bullshit
lien through Justin.

110
00:08:32,478 --> 00:08:35,470
So he's in second position
on the mortgage.

111
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:37,311
Through Justin?

112
00:08:37,383 --> 00:08:38,850
It's gonna be fine.
Don't worry.

113
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:40,044
Fuck!

114
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:44,153
Jamal? What the hell are you
doing down there?

115
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:45,690
He says there's lobsters
under there.

116
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:50,092
Well, use a push broom and sweep
them out, for Christ's sake.

117
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:52,255
I need your help here,
Michael, right now.

118
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:54,128
All right. I just got to
drive Kerry home.

119
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,397
No. I'll personally
order Miss Kerry...

120
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,370
Brooklyn's finest car service...

121
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:01,338
but right now,
go to the restaurant...

122
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:03,500
pick up a push broom, OK?

123
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:04,702
Aye, aye.

124
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,477
Yeah. Just let me
take care of it...

125
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,847
and I'll call you as soon
as I'm done, OK?

126
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:14,079
OK. But you still think you
can make it for dinner?

127
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:15,745
- Yeah, late dinner.
- OK.

128
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,775
See, you take it,
and it's got the little thing.

129
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:51,448
- You kind of pull it out.
- Why would I?

130
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:52,752
Sugar pie.

131
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:56,386
Morning, Muffin.
How are you?

132
00:09:56,462 --> 00:09:58,259
Back in Lobster Land?

133
00:09:58,331 --> 00:09:59,764
Just for the holidays.

134
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:00,924
How are you, Beth?

135
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,992
I'm doing good. Doing real good.
How are you doing?

136
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,230
How's your little
Internet thing doing?

137
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:06,635
Not too bad.

138
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:11,206
What's up with the sloths?

139
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:15,369
It's like a little
weed in there. Ready?

140
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,416
See, it goes in and--

141
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:19,713
God.

142
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,878
- It just squirted out.
- It's gonna d--

143
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,819
- Piss clam?
- Yeah.

144
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:26,750
What's your name?

145
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:28,157
Joey.

146
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:29,455
Doug.

147
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:31,291
My name's Michael Giorgio.

148
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:32,456
Here's what's gonna happen.

149
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:34,999
You're gonna change
the station to 101.1 Oldies...

150
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:36,261
because that's all we
listen to around here.

151
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:37,427
You're gonna take this,
and you're gonna...

152
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:39,733
bring it into wholesale.
Go ahead. Don't be afraid.

153
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:40,897
And then when you're both done,
you're gonna come back...

154
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,167
and you're gonna restock
the bay scallops...

155
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:43,731
because they're running low.

156
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,276
And I would imagine that
you're being paid...

157
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:46,811
to do stuff like that.

158
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:48,278
but before you do any of that,
Teen Wolf here's gonna put...

159
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:50,975
a hat on because no one wants
hair in their fish, right?

160
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:08,792
Which column?

161
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:11,962
It's under "Puppies"
near the kitten section.

162
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:19,537
Well, if they notice,
the referee could cancel...

163
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:21,842
for today, buying you a stall.

164
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:23,905
If they don't notice,
no one will be there...

165
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:25,507
to bid up the property.

166
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:27,211
Justin will be there.

167
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:30,084
Yes. Just his fake
company foreclosing.

168
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:32,420
How will the FDIC
let me foreclose...

169
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:35,551
if they're in first position?

170
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:38,358
The FDIC could try to sue you
to get the remainder...

171
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:39,728
of the balance, but--

172
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,391
But, but it's like trying
to get money...

173
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:43,492
out of a ham sandwich
at that point.

174
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:51,140
The prodigal son
has returned to us.

175
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,906
Jesus. You guys unloaded
the whole house in here.

176
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:55,844
Yeah. We did.

177
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:58,679
There's a lot of shit
at my place, too.

178
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:00,309
We kept some of your stuff.

179
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:08,051
Who bought the house anyway?

180
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:12,120
A very nice, happy couple
with lots of money.

181
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:16,692
What's up with Dad's
office dorm room? Cozy.

182
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:19,033
Michael, he has truly lost it.

183
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:22,802
So what, are they-- what,
are they, like, separating?

184
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,035
He doesn't want to look
for a new place.

185
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:27,546
He's up here.
She's staying at my place.

186
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:30,605
I guess you could call that
a separation.

187
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:34,278
Lauren, could you bring down
the Jade Mumbo tickets?

188
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:36,184
Michael will bring them down
in a minute, Daddy.

189
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:39,281
No. You tell Michael to get his
ass down here right now.

190
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:52,031
- Help you with something?
- I'm Mrs. Giorgio.

191
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:53,196
Mike's around here somewhere.

192
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,103
- Mom.
- Oh, Mikey.

193
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:56,607
- Hi.
- How are you?

194
00:12:56,675 --> 00:12:58,734
I'm good. How was your trip?

195
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:00,039
- Horrible.
- Yeah?

196
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:01,739
Yeah. Red eye. Middle seat.

197
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:03,338
You know, crying baby,
the whole bit.

198
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:05,315
It sounds great.

199
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:06,578
How's my Kerry?

200
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:08,347
She's good.

201
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:11,048
- Good.
- How are you?

202
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:14,251
Well, I thought the cheese was
slipping off my cracker...

203
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:15,918
for a while, but I'm good.

204
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:18,828
I'm moving forward.

205
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:20,092
You really getting
your own place?

206
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:21,690
- I am.
- Really?

207
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:22,859
Yeah. I think it's time.

208
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:25,563
I think Justin and Lauren
need their own space.

209
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,401
Guess you wouldn't
want to live upstairs?

210
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,872
Dad's living like an animal.

211
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:31,205
Well, as long as he's
comfortable living...

212
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:32,938
with his sea creatures,
I'm happy for him.

213
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:34,536
I just don't want to do
this anymore.

214
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:35,807
- Hey, Mom.
- Hi, honey.

215
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:37,508
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

216
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:38,709
Good.

217
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,760
- Here he comes.
- Dad.

218
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:57,634
Good evening, your honor.

219
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:00,733
This guy the judge?

220
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:02,933
Former judge, now a referee.

221
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:14,909
Are parties representing
Block 14, Lot 31...

222
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:16,648
D.B.A. Giorgio's
Lobster Farm present?

223
00:14:16,722 --> 00:14:18,189
Your honor, we need
to postpone this auction...

224
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:19,918
due to lack of notice posted...

225
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:24,224
by the foreclosing second
mortgagee, Justin Wallace, Inc.

226
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:28,366
Is a member
of Justin Wallace, Inc. here?

227
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:33,497
Yes, your honor.
I'm Justin Wallace... Inc.

228
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:37,338
Your honor, I believe notice was
posted in the city paper...

229
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:38,501
as required by this auction.

230
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:41,011
You will see, your honor,
that he posted notice...

231
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,776
in the Pet Adoption section
of the paper.

232
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,014
It's a lobster farm?

233
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:51,522
I thought it was fitting.

234
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,421
Your honor, I believe that
the second mortgagee...

235
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:54,959
and Mr. Giorgio are connected.

236
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:56,221
Connected?

237
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:57,523
Know each other.

238
00:14:57,596 --> 00:14:59,029
Is there a law against
knowing the person...

239
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:00,759
initiating the foreclosure?

240
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,802
Mr. Giorgio, I can understand
your wanting to keep...

241
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:05,666
this auction a secret.

242
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,137
Notice was posted.

243
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:09,538
And now he will
post notice properly.

244
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:11,439
Your honor, can we have
a little more time...

245
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:14,001
to see if we can work out
a refinancing with the FDIC?

246
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,376
Ample time has been given.

247
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:18,109
Bullshit. They just want
to tidy up their books...

248
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:19,275
before the new year.

249
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:21,751
Sorry, your honor.
Mr. Giorgio's upset.

250
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,378
His livelihood's at stake here.

251
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:24,854
There are circumstances.

252
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,289
What circumstances?

253
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:29,691
The FDIC took over
Capital Trust...

254
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:30,990
Mr. Giorgio's bank.

255
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:32,997
They foreclosed on all
the small business loans.

256
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:39,231
They sent a letter that
basically said, "Pay or die."

257
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:41,205
My bank goes under...

258
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:44,436
and the FDIC puts
a gun to my head.

259
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,705
- That's not true.
- You bet your ass it's true!

260
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,144
Mr. Giorgio.

261
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:55,645
Would you mind if
I come closer, your honor?

262
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:57,951
Please, come forward.

263
00:15:58,023 --> 00:16:01,049
There's just one more thing.

264
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:03,856
This property has been
in my family's name...

265
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:08,161
for over sixty years.

266
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:16,800
My family catered to this entire
community for over sixty years.

267
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:19,343
Now I'm willing to fulfill
my obligation.

268
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:26,817
All I'm asking is that the FDIC
reconsider their position.

269
00:16:26,885 --> 00:16:31,822
After all,
the bank defaulted, not me.

270
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:38,328
Mr. Giorgio, I can
understand your sentiment.

271
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:41,924
However, you cannot appeal
your foreclosure here.

272
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,993
The new auction date is set
for Friday, December 18.

273
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:47,300
That is all.

274
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:48,499
Thank you, your honor.

275
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:55,306
Don't mess with my system,
Lauren, dear.

276
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:57,508
OK. Throwing dirty clothes
in your hamper's...

277
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,380
messing with your system?

278
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:02,716
First, make sure they're dirty.

279
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:04,756
You want to check?

280
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:07,986
Dad, how long do you plan on
camping out up here?

281
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:11,120
I have my little shower,
my beddy-by...

282
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:14,597
my socks and undies table.
I'm all set.

283
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:16,497
This place is a pigsty.

284
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:19,366
I told you, you're welcome
to come up here...

285
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:21,429
and depigify the place.

286
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:25,534
And I told you I am not going to
share my home with dead fish.

287
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:32,044
What do you smell?

288
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:33,880
Seriously.

289
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:35,613
Foot powder.

290
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:38,780
Foot powder.

291
00:17:38,857 --> 00:17:43,487
Cape Cod-style home in Brooklyn.

292
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:46,224
People would die
to live up here.

293
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:50,598
A beautiful balcony
overlooking a marina?

294
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,634
I could make
the main office a den.

295
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:56,503
We got to get going, Lauren.
Got to pick up Aimee.

296
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,202
You're right. We do.

297
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:01,643
Justin, did you-- do you want to?

298
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:05,809
Yeah. If it would be all right
with you, Frank...

299
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:10,719
I'd like to bring
that franchise guy by tomorrow.

300
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:13,155
Thank you, Justin,
but I'd rather not.

301
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:14,954
You can at least talk to him.

302
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:16,187
I don't want to turn
my restaurant...

303
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,559
into a burger joint.

304
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,359
A McDonald's, Dad.

305
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:23,765
Burger King, Wendy's, Taco Bell.

306
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:25,235
I'll be in the car.

307
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,096
Thank you, Dad.

308
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:30,664
I really appreciate that.

309
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:38,982
Please don't start.

310
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:40,279
He took a risk for you today.

311
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:42,650
At least you could hear him out.

312
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:54,989
You still looking for a place?

313
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:57,900
I'm taking a place
around the corner from Lauren.

314
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,962
You sure didn't waste any time.

315
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,199
What, are you kidding?

316
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:04,640
Well, how long you been looking?
Two weeks?

317
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,439
What does it matter?

318
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:09,208
You're very happy up
in your little clubhouse alone.

319
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:12,614
Come on, come on, Maureen.
Are you serious about this?

320
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:13,912
I'm buying it.

321
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,648
How're you even going to
pay for it?

322
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:18,383
My sister's gonna help me.

323
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:20,751
Your sister?

324
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:23,489
Fine, great.

325
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:25,757
Congratulations.

326
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:26,957
Thank you.

327
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:29,430
Okey-dokey.

328
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:53,485
You OK?

329
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:54,753
Yeah.

330
00:19:57,162 --> 00:19:59,062
- Can we go?
- Yeah.

331
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:06,065
OK. You want to tell me
what's on your mind?

332
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:07,264
Well, I...

333
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:15,303
I just thought you were
going to ask Kerry soon.

334
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,314
I'm thinking about it.

335
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:18,849
Well, it's Christmas,
and it's such...

336
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:21,852
a beautiful time to ask
somebody to marry them.

337
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,684
- I don't have the ring yet.
- But you're looking.

338
00:20:24,756 --> 00:20:26,883
I don't have it yet,
but as soon as I get it...

339
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:29,553
you'll be the first
to know, I swear.

340
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:30,856
I'm begging you,
please start the car.

341
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:34,228
I forgot how we easy
you are to read.

342
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:35,561
Jesus.

343
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:37,158
Especially when you're
hiding something.

344
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,295
I'm not hiding anything.

345
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:40,838
Can I see it?

346
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,271
I'm just teasing, Mikey.

347
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:47,710
It's in the front pocket
of the laptop case.

348
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:49,940
I knew it.
I could smell it!

349
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:52,308
I'll get it.

350
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:08,359
What's the matter?

351
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:11,162
What?

352
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:15,139
Nothing.

353
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:16,504
You hate it?

354
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:18,133
No.

355
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:21,577
- You hate it.
- I li-- no. I like it.

356
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:23,171
Just say you hate it.

357
00:21:23,248 --> 00:21:24,715
The ring's not that important.

358
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:27,752
Well, it doesn't matter.
It was done.

359
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:30,447
Forget about it.
So just forget it.

360
00:21:30,522 --> 00:21:32,080
You're not gonna ask her now?

361
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:33,886
No.

362
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:37,895
Not with the Fisher-Price
shit ring your son bought.

363
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:42,666
You know, your grandmother
had a beautiful ring.

364
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:44,429
Really? Well, maybe
we can exhume her.

365
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:45,800
I'm not digging up my mother.

366
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:47,099
I was kidding.

367
00:21:47,172 --> 00:21:48,730
I think I might have it.

368
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:52,701
Not that you couldn't use yours.

369
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:54,268
Your c-- Mom,
I want to go, please.

370
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:55,813
Turn the car on.

371
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:08,721
- Michael.
- Hello, Mr. Miller.

372
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:10,489
Come in.

373
00:22:10,562 --> 00:22:12,393
Thank you.

374
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:13,658
What have you got there?

375
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:15,597
Lobster, shrimp.

376
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:16,861
Lobster, shrimp?

377
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:18,232
- Yeah.
- That sounds delicious.

378
00:22:18,303 --> 00:22:19,531
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

379
00:22:19,604 --> 00:22:21,663
Here you go.

380
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,469
- It's leaking a little there.
- I'm sorry.

381
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:25,635
That's OK.
I can handle that.

382
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:29,272
Hey, Lynn?
Lynn, I need a sponge.

383
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:31,407
- Hi, babe.
- Hi.

384
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:33,246
What happened at court?

385
00:22:33,318 --> 00:22:34,842
Postponed.

386
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,251
Is that good?

387
00:22:36,321 --> 00:22:38,346
Well, it's good for now.

388
00:22:38,423 --> 00:22:40,050
I hope you're hungry.

389
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:41,717
Oh, God.

390
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:43,590
Yes, I know. Yes.

391
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:47,862
I always thought you were
kidding when you said...

392
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:49,833
you didn't eat seafood.

393
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:50,993
Are you the only one?

394
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:53,469
No. Nobody in my family
eats seafood.

395
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:56,200
Your family must know
something we don't know.

396
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:01,672
Where did your folks move to?

397
00:23:01,747 --> 00:23:04,375
They're looking for a place.

398
00:23:04,449 --> 00:23:05,939
Where are they now?

399
00:23:06,017 --> 00:23:08,008
My sister's in Brooklyn.

400
00:23:08,086 --> 00:23:09,747
They had to sell the house?

401
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:11,550
Your mom must be heartbroken.

402
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:14,989
She's all right.

403
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,288
Change is good.

404
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:19,296
Transitions can be fun.
It's true.

405
00:23:19,364 --> 00:23:20,797
Is it just a money thing?

406
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:22,993
Dad.

407
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:25,730
The foreclosure was
on your dad's business, right?

408
00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:28,739
The bank defaulted on the loan.

409
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:37,344
Maybe my brother could help.

410
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:38,542
Yeah?

411
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:40,209
He's an M&A attorney.

412
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:42,219
Really? M&A?

413
00:23:42,287 --> 00:23:44,721
Yeah. He's right over
in Garden City.

414
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,485
Lynn works there now.

415
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:48,116
That's a very good idea.

416
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:50,593
I could talk to him
about it tomorrow.

417
00:23:50,662 --> 00:23:53,096
I'll talk to him, Lynn.

418
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:54,928
Well, what could he do?

419
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,867
Chuck could set your dad up
with some money guys...

420
00:23:57,936 --> 00:23:59,995
some real Wall Street
heavy hitters.

421
00:24:00,071 --> 00:24:01,231
How do you mean?

422
00:24:01,306 --> 00:24:03,171
Well, they could buy
the note from the bank...

423
00:24:03,241 --> 00:24:06,039
and then set up a refinance with
your father.

424
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:10,644
Well, I'll talk
to my dad about it.

425
00:24:10,715 --> 00:24:13,240
You know, Chuck's having
a holiday party tomorrow night.

426
00:24:13,318 --> 00:24:15,445
Why don't you stop by
for a cocktail?

427
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:18,816
Yeah. I'll try to make it.

428
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:20,551
Chuck's very nice.

429
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,786
He set up Kerry
with some job interviews...

430
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:24,920
after the holidays.

431
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:28,491
After the holidays.

432
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:30,034
In New York?

433
00:24:30,101 --> 00:24:31,864
It's nothing definite.

434
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:33,666
If you want to stay
a little later, too...

435
00:24:33,738 --> 00:24:35,638
you're welcome to stay
in our basement.

436
00:24:35,707 --> 00:24:37,174
We refinished it.

437
00:24:38,543 --> 00:24:39,805
Thank you.

438
00:24:58,597 --> 00:25:02,033
I was going to talk to you
about moving back first.

439
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,294
Really?

440
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:13,839
I just want to know
what's going on in your head.

441
00:25:16,448 --> 00:25:18,712
You want to move back here?

442
00:25:18,783 --> 00:25:21,479
For good?

443
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:24,317
I want us to move back.

444
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:32,489
It's Tony.

445
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,492
Hey, Tony.

446
00:25:37,435 --> 00:25:42,839
Do you think it would be
sacrilegious to have Santa...

447
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:44,569
be one of the wise guys?

448
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:48,135
'Cause I cannot find
the third guy.

449
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:50,613
No. He was a saint...

450
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:53,150
So I think you'll be
all right with that.

451
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:55,015
Saint.

452
00:25:55,086 --> 00:26:00,490
They're all a bunch
of plastic freeloaders anyway.

453
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:01,753
All right, Tony.

454
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:09,397
This property is
in the ass-end of Brooklyn.

455
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:12,595
Nobody's gonna put up
800,000, 900,000 for it.

456
00:26:12,671 --> 00:26:15,469
Someone would just have to put
up thirty percent though.

457
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:19,533
You got 300,000
on you, tough guy?

458
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:21,272
No.

459
00:26:21,346 --> 00:26:26,215
Plus I got my shit card.
There's no sewer down here.

460
00:26:26,284 --> 00:26:28,718
Only a cesspool, thank Christ.

461
00:26:34,693 --> 00:26:35,955
Can you do me a favor?

462
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:39,360
- What's that?
- Talk to your mother.

463
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:43,492
See if she's serious
about getting her own place.

464
00:26:43,568 --> 00:26:46,128
I think she already did.

465
00:26:46,204 --> 00:26:48,695
What a bullshit, hasty decision.

466
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:50,001
I don't think so.

467
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:51,542
You don't?

468
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,009
No. She's cramped at Lauren's,
and you don't want...

469
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:54,511
to look for a place.

470
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:57,810
Well, Christ. I just want
to put out this fire first!

471
00:26:57,882 --> 00:26:59,440
There's always a fire, Dad.

472
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:07,317
Honey, I love the kissing post.

473
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:08,882
I don't know if you love
the kissing post.

474
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,723
Because if you're not gonna use
the kissing post...

475
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:12,524
then the kissing post
is gonna be gone.

476
00:27:12,597 --> 00:27:13,689
It's a one year--

477
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:15,232
It can't go away.

478
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,495
Kissing post.
I am the kissing post.

479
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:19,469
Kissing post.

480
00:27:19,537 --> 00:27:20,629
Oh, my God.

481
00:27:20,705 --> 00:27:23,503
Do you guys need anything
at the store?

482
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:24,837
No.

483
00:27:24,909 --> 00:27:26,740
Great. OK. Bye.

484
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:27,937
Thank you.

485
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:39,586
Mom, I just want to say...

486
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:41,592
I do not want you to be
embarrassed at all.

487
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,752
I mean, Justin and I--

488
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:45,660
Honey, I'm not embarrassed.
It's OK.

489
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:49,723
OK. I just-- I don't want you
to feel like you're intruding...

490
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:51,132
or anything like that.

491
00:27:51,202 --> 00:27:54,365
I know that,
and you two have been terrific.

492
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:58,068
It's just this situation
is ridiculous.

493
00:27:58,143 --> 00:28:00,202
I'm too young to be
a burden already.

494
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:02,838
Mom, you're so not a burden,
and you know that.

495
00:28:02,914 --> 00:28:06,873
Lauren, the old granny
living with her daughter.

496
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:08,942
- All I want...
- Ma.

497
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,989
Is my own life
and my own place...

498
00:28:12,057 --> 00:28:14,491
and I want to put all
of my things together...

499
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:16,789
and that's all I want.

500
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:18,419
That's it.

501
00:28:18,496 --> 00:28:20,896
And you're gonna do it alone...

502
00:28:20,965 --> 00:28:23,331
without Dad?

503
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:26,495
I don't know if it's I'm not
wanting to understand that, Mom.

504
00:28:26,571 --> 00:28:29,039
I'm just-- I'm trying to--

505
00:28:29,107 --> 00:28:35,103
Honey, I have been alone
throughout this entire marriage.

506
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,307
Now I dearly love your father...

507
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:41,318
but since you and Michael left,
we have nothing to talk about...

508
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:45,948
except the claws.

509
00:28:46,024 --> 00:28:49,790
There's not that much to say
about crustaceans.

510
00:28:49,861 --> 00:28:51,419
A couple of things.

511
00:28:53,832 --> 00:28:55,197
I'm fine.

512
00:28:55,266 --> 00:28:57,257
I'll say you are.

513
00:28:57,335 --> 00:28:58,495
I love you, sweetie.

514
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,868
Mom. I love you, Mommy.

515
00:29:00,939 --> 00:29:02,770
You're gonna come back,
aren't you?

516
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:04,468
- I'll come back.
- All right.

517
00:29:04,542 --> 00:29:06,066
I mean, you'll come back
tonight, too.

518
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:07,372
I'm definitely
coming back tonight.

519
00:29:07,445 --> 00:29:09,777
- Well, everything, yeah.
- My things are here.

520
00:29:09,848 --> 00:29:12,078
Yeah. OK.

521
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:38,505
It's like we're camping again.

522
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:43,111
We never went camping.

523
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:44,375
Right.

524
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:47,214
How's Miss Kerry?

525
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:48,513
She's OK.

526
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:51,812
She wants to move back.

527
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:55,854
Yeah, it's hard to take
a girl away...

528
00:29:55,927 --> 00:29:58,725
from her friends and family.

529
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:01,357
You're at work, she's at home...

530
00:30:01,432 --> 00:30:05,198
with just the birds
and the trees.

531
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:08,296
Dad, she had a job.
She was working, too.

532
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:10,637
No shit.

533
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:13,006
Good for her.

534
00:30:13,077 --> 00:30:15,568
I always knew she was
a smart little cookie.

535
00:30:18,883 --> 00:30:21,215
What was she doing?

536
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:25,120
Some bullshit position
at the "Seattle Times."

537
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:27,522
"Seattle Times."

538
00:30:27,592 --> 00:30:30,959
There's a lot more
opportunities in New York.

539
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:34,726
Yeah, I'm sure you can do your
dotcom think in New York, too.

540
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:39,698
Don't you mean dotclam?

541
00:30:39,771 --> 00:30:46,006
I'm only saying you don't have
to come back here full-time.

542
00:30:46,077 --> 00:30:48,545
Well, maybe just a year.

543
00:30:50,481 --> 00:30:52,608
I'll stay off your ass
this time.

544
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:53,810
I swear.

545
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:57,984
A year's a long time, Dad.

546
00:31:00,158 --> 00:31:01,750
Maybe not a year then.

547
00:31:03,661 --> 00:31:05,526
Just a little while.

548
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:09,556
Like, six months a little while,
two weeks a little while?

549
00:31:09,634 --> 00:31:12,228
I don't know.

550
00:31:12,303 --> 00:31:13,600
A little while.

551
00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:18,566
All right.
I'll think about it.

552
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:35,423
Yeah, probably six months
a little while.

553
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:40,360
Night, Dad.

554
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:43,729
Good morning everybody.
It's your Cousin Brucie...

555
00:31:43,835 --> 00:31:46,201
and right now, I'm gonna wake
you up and keep you...

556
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:48,398
moving and grooving
with some doo-wop...

557
00:31:48,473 --> 00:31:51,670
straight from my home borough,
the borough of Brooklyn.

558
00:32:21,673 --> 00:32:22,935
Frank.

559
00:32:23,007 --> 00:32:25,475
Red says he's not got
no more bakala.

560
00:32:25,543 --> 00:32:27,909
Fuck Red. Go to Franco.

561
00:32:27,979 --> 00:32:29,071
OK.

562
00:32:29,147 --> 00:32:31,411
Billy, I'll see you over
at the Pearl.

563
00:32:31,482 --> 00:32:32,608
Got it.

564
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,945
For Maureen from Jen.

565
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:43,821
It's not
a sump pump motor, is it?

566
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:45,829
The salt water's not back on?

567
00:32:45,897 --> 00:32:48,263
Not yet.
Billy, I wanted to ask you.

568
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:53,430
That crazy bastard who sold used
machine parts in Chinatown.

569
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,903
I'm talking about ten years ago.

570
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,941
Yeah. Jimmy Chen.

571
00:32:57,008 --> 00:32:58,305
He's long gone now.

572
00:32:58,376 --> 00:32:59,707
Dead maybe.

573
00:32:59,777 --> 00:33:01,074
Shit.

574
00:33:03,614 --> 00:33:07,710
- Everything all right?
- Yeah. Everything's fine. Yeah.

575
00:33:07,785 --> 00:33:08,979
The legal thing.

576
00:33:09,053 --> 00:33:11,078
Yeah, it'll work itself out.

577
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:13,589
It's gonna be fine.

578
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:17,822
Wow. Check that out.

579
00:33:17,895 --> 00:33:19,760
Baby.

580
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:21,560
Beautiful.

581
00:33:21,632 --> 00:33:24,931
Check the wheels
on that son of a bitch.

582
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:28,734
It's got, like,
two-inch treads on it.

583
00:33:28,806 --> 00:33:31,172
Hey, where'd you get
that hand truck?

584
00:33:31,242 --> 00:33:37,909
No. Where'd you get your
mano coachy?

585
00:33:37,982 --> 00:33:39,449
Mano coachy?

586
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:41,417
Mano coachy.

587
00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:46,048
Your huevos ranchos
has arrived, Senor Lau.

588
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:49,093
Muchos gracias, amigo.

589
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,560
Lauren? Lauren, hold on.

590
00:33:51,629 --> 00:33:53,859
Here. Give this to Michael.

591
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:56,491
- What the heck is this?
- It's Grandma's ring.

592
00:33:56,567 --> 00:33:58,899
- And?
- I'll explain later.

593
00:34:02,173 --> 00:34:04,437
- You guys got to band them up.
- Put the cuffs on them.

594
00:34:04,509 --> 00:34:06,306
What do you mean,
put the cuffs on them?

595
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:07,469
Timo, show him what to do.

596
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:09,012
Hey, Michael.
Can I talk to you a minute?

597
00:34:11,282 --> 00:34:13,273
How're you doing?

598
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:15,114
- I'm all right.
- Yeah?

599
00:34:15,186 --> 00:34:16,380
What's up, Tom?

600
00:34:16,454 --> 00:34:19,548
The shit's really hitting
the fan with the old man, no?

601
00:34:19,624 --> 00:34:21,558
Sort of, yeah.

602
00:34:21,626 --> 00:34:23,924
Well, I got something, you know,
that can really pull him out...

603
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:25,223
of the mud, you know...

604
00:34:25,296 --> 00:34:27,059
maybe give him
a nice blast of cash.

605
00:34:27,131 --> 00:34:28,291
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

606
00:34:28,366 --> 00:34:30,027
Can you meet me after work?

607
00:34:30,101 --> 00:34:32,228
- Yeah, sure, I'll try.
- Mikey, do that, OK?

608
00:34:32,303 --> 00:34:33,668
It's kind of time sensitive,
all right?

609
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:34,830
- All right, man.
- See you later.

610
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:36,032
All right, Tom.

611
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:40,540
Morning, Frank.

612
00:34:40,611 --> 00:34:41,737
Hi, Beth.

613
00:35:01,532 --> 00:35:02,692
Starting to sleep.

614
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:05,793
I know. This lulls her.

615
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:07,599
What's the matter?
You still mad?

616
00:35:07,672 --> 00:35:10,505
Yes, I am.

617
00:35:10,575 --> 00:35:12,907
Look, it's not that
I don't appreciate...

618
00:35:12,977 --> 00:35:14,501
what Justin was trying to do.

619
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:16,809
Dad, you didn't let him finish.

620
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:18,940
He wasn't saying to keep it
a McDonald's forever.

621
00:35:19,016 --> 00:35:21,416
I mean, he was trying to explain
that you could use...

622
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:24,421
the franchise for five years to
get yourself out of the mud...

623
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:26,855
and then you can make your
Lundy's Seafood Palace...

624
00:35:26,924 --> 00:35:28,186
the one you've always
wanted, you know?

625
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:30,022
Once you're clear.

626
00:35:30,094 --> 00:35:32,119
You think the guy putting up
the dough for the franchise...

627
00:35:32,196 --> 00:35:36,656
is gonna agree
to a five-year lease?

628
00:35:36,734 --> 00:35:38,599
You can bet your ass he won't.

629
00:35:38,669 --> 00:35:41,661
No. I got to do this
the way I want to do it, OK?

630
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:45,971
Well, sure, Dad.
Your way's always the best.

631
00:35:46,043 --> 00:35:47,635
All right. Could you watch
Aimee for a few minutes, Beth?

632
00:35:47,712 --> 00:35:50,545
Lauren, come on.
For Christ's sake.

633
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:56,352
Those kids did the writing thing
again on the lighthouse.

634
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:58,786
Tommy, after this, clean it off.

635
00:35:58,856 --> 00:36:00,016
How's it going, Tony?

636
00:36:00,091 --> 00:36:02,559
Well, we found the sewage pipe.

637
00:36:02,627 --> 00:36:03,992
Which one's the sewage pipe?

638
00:36:04,061 --> 00:36:05,221
The white one.

639
00:36:05,296 --> 00:36:08,925
But the break in the salt water
pipe could be anywhere.

640
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,968
Could be from here to the store.

641
00:36:11,035 --> 00:36:12,468
There's not much more time.

642
00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:16,132
What, how long have the lobster
aliens been deprived of oxygen?

643
00:36:16,207 --> 00:36:17,333
They've been out
of the water a long time.

644
00:36:17,408 --> 00:36:18,932
They're gonna start dying.

645
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,604
I think we have to dump them.

646
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,738
Right. let's dump the crates
in the harbor.

647
00:36:23,814 --> 00:36:25,941
You're gonna dump
boxes of cash...

648
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,917
and float them
on the water?

649
00:36:27,985 --> 00:36:29,509
We have no choice.

650
00:36:29,587 --> 00:36:31,054
Tommy, don't forget
the lighthouse.

651
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:33,590
Jamal, you have to start
packing crates.

652
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:44,858
We need to transfer them.

653
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,345
Come on!

654
00:36:57,415 --> 00:36:58,677
Come on, Tommy.

655
00:37:08,526 --> 00:37:11,689
Michael, tuck them in
and make them comfortable.

656
00:37:11,762 --> 00:37:14,526
That a way.
Good job, fellas. Good job.

657
00:37:23,274 --> 00:37:26,334
Wasn't perfect,
but we got them in.

658
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:30,345
Christ. When I started
with my dad...

659
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:35,613
we had to hump the crates down
here every other week.

660
00:37:35,686 --> 00:37:37,278
Used shitty tanks?

661
00:37:37,355 --> 00:37:40,847
Tanks? It's more like
jerry-rigged bathtubs.

662
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:43,052
Your grandfather was
a great businessman...

663
00:37:43,127 --> 00:37:45,595
but not exactly an engineer.

664
00:37:45,663 --> 00:37:47,597
He thought he had
it covered once.

665
00:37:47,665 --> 00:37:48,757
You know, he went out
to the bowery...

666
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:53,463
and he bought five
old Coca-Cola machines...

667
00:37:53,537 --> 00:37:56,802
the kind that had
cold water swirling in it?

668
00:37:56,874 --> 00:37:58,432
You know, he'd wake me up
at 5 a.m.

669
00:37:58,509 --> 00:38:00,670
We'd come down right here...

670
00:38:00,745 --> 00:38:02,838
and we'd get a couple
of garbage pails...

671
00:38:02,913 --> 00:38:05,541
and fill it up with salt water.

672
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:09,211
We'd dump the water
into the Coca-Cola machine.

673
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:13,053
We put in about fifty lobsters.

674
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:18,323
Twenty-four hours later,
every lobster dropped dead.

675
00:38:22,166 --> 00:38:23,861
It fucking drove him crazy.

676
00:38:23,934 --> 00:38:26,494
He couldn't figure out why all
the lobsters were dying.

677
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:28,037
Why were they dying?

678
00:38:28,105 --> 00:38:31,632
Well, there was copper tubing
and it reacted...

679
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:33,700
to the salt water...

680
00:38:33,778 --> 00:38:36,747
poisoned all
the little bastards.

681
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:40,648
Every morning,
fifty dead lobsters.

682
00:38:40,718 --> 00:38:42,743
God.

683
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,653
His face was priceless.

684
00:38:45,723 --> 00:38:49,819
To look down and see
that they died again?

685
00:38:49,894 --> 00:38:51,657
Fucking priceless.

686
00:38:56,067 --> 00:38:59,434
All right.
Let's fill Bill's order.

687
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:01,403
Chinatown, baby.

688
00:39:15,252 --> 00:39:17,083
We're gonna be
in this forever.

689
00:39:17,154 --> 00:39:19,281
Michael, Mikey, you're gonna
have to hand truck it down.

690
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:20,483
Oh, come on.
He needs it right now?

691
00:39:20,558 --> 00:39:22,287
He needs it right now.
What, you want me to do it?

692
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,884
- No.
- Well, go ahead.

693
00:39:23,961 --> 00:39:26,156
I'll meet you in front,
all right?

694
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:27,754
We're gonna-- I'm gonna be
here forever anyway.

695
00:39:27,832 --> 00:39:29,493
- All right, all right.
- Jesus Christ!

696
00:39:31,001 --> 00:39:32,263
Uncle Billy.

697
00:39:34,405 --> 00:39:36,600
Hey. How're you doing?

698
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:52,849
Michael!

699
00:39:52,923 --> 00:39:54,015
Should I come back?

700
00:39:54,091 --> 00:39:56,218
No. Come in.
It's so good to see you.

701
00:39:56,293 --> 00:39:58,227
- Good to see you. Hey.
- Hi.

702
00:39:58,295 --> 00:40:02,163
It's good to see-- so grownup.

703
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,325
How's your mom?

704
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,369
She's doing well. Thanks.
How are you?

705
00:40:05,436 --> 00:40:06,733
I'm fine.

706
00:40:06,804 --> 00:40:09,602
- Mindy is driving me crazy.
- Mom!

707
00:40:09,673 --> 00:40:12,642
Ever since she turned sixteen,
she's complete nightmare.

708
00:40:18,048 --> 00:40:20,107
You know what?
My sister was worse.

709
00:40:20,184 --> 00:40:21,276
- Really?
- She is worse.

710
00:40:21,352 --> 00:40:22,444
You're kidding.

711
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,612
I don't know if it could
get any worse.

712
00:40:23,687 --> 00:40:25,245
What's with Hurricane Mindy?

713
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:28,884
Really?

714
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,255
All right.
Let's get the boxes.

715
00:40:31,328 --> 00:40:32,761
OK. Bye, Jen.

716
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:34,491
Bye.

717
00:40:35,132 --> 00:40:38,101
- Holy Jesus, Bill.
- What?

718
00:40:38,169 --> 00:40:39,329
What the hell you
keep down here?

719
00:40:39,403 --> 00:40:40,802
It smells awful.

720
00:40:40,871 --> 00:40:43,635
What smell are you
talking about? Come on.

721
00:40:43,707 --> 00:40:44,969
Bill, you know what?

722
00:40:45,042 --> 00:40:47,510
You spend too much time
down here is the problem.

723
00:40:53,017 --> 00:40:54,143
What is that?

724
00:40:54,218 --> 00:40:55,583
It's shark fin.

725
00:40:55,653 --> 00:40:57,382
- Shark fin?
- Yeah. Look.

726
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:58,820
You cut them like this.

727
00:40:58,889 --> 00:41:00,413
People eat that?

728
00:41:00,491 --> 00:41:02,789
They usually go nuts
for the fin.

729
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,327
Usually for soup.

730
00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:05,487
That's gross.

731
00:41:05,563 --> 00:41:06,655
Come on.

732
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:07,992
Give this to your father.

733
00:41:08,065 --> 00:41:09,760
Tell him to go into the shark
fin business with me...

734
00:41:09,834 --> 00:41:11,062
no more problems.

735
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:12,864
Yeah.

736
00:41:12,937 --> 00:41:14,529
What, are you serious?

737
00:41:14,605 --> 00:41:16,903
- I love your father.
- I know.

738
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:19,966
Your dad is my
most favorite lo fon.

739
00:41:20,044 --> 00:41:22,410
- Lo what?
- Lo fon.

740
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,711
- Low fat?
- Non-Chinese person?

741
00:41:25,783 --> 00:41:27,751
A lot of lobsters
crawling all over...

742
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:29,183
but you'll love it.

743
00:41:29,253 --> 00:41:32,450
And there he is, talking to my
least favorite Chinese person.

744
00:41:32,523 --> 00:41:33,888
- You remember my brother Ron?
- Hey, Ron.

745
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:36,722
You better cut
your brother some slack.

746
00:41:36,794 --> 00:41:39,627
I think his cellphones are
outselling your halibut.

747
00:41:39,697 --> 00:41:41,426
Maybe I'll just go
to the Bahamas...

748
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:43,262
and you let you
oon-gots run things.

749
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:44,733
- Oon-gots?
- Oon-what?

750
00:41:44,802 --> 00:41:46,599
- Oon-gots?
- Oon-who?

751
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:50,102
Hey, you guys need
a new phone or what?

752
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:51,698
- Actually, I do.
- Pick one, Mike.

753
00:41:51,775 --> 00:41:53,709
I'll put this in the pickup.
Bye-bye, Bill.

754
00:41:53,777 --> 00:41:55,677
- Hey, what about you?
- No, thank you.

755
00:41:55,746 --> 00:41:57,611
I'll stick with my old one.

756
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,285
Well, it's about time.

757
00:42:06,156 --> 00:42:07,350
Dad.

758
00:42:09,126 --> 00:42:10,957
What the hell is that?

759
00:42:12,963 --> 00:42:14,521
Shark fin.

760
00:42:14,598 --> 00:42:16,031
Shark fin?

761
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,192
Yeah. I think Uncle Bill
wants you to go...

762
00:42:17,268 --> 00:42:18,360
into the shark fin
business with him.

763
00:42:18,435 --> 00:42:20,630
A shark fin on rye
with extra sour pickle?

764
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:21,796
That's fucking delicious.

765
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:22,964
Dad, I'm serious.

766
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,507
I think he wants
to help you out.

767
00:42:24,575 --> 00:42:25,701
Just...

768
00:42:27,311 --> 00:42:28,573
It's gonna be fine.

769
00:42:28,646 --> 00:42:31,046
OK. Maybe if we...

770
00:42:31,115 --> 00:42:34,016
enough, no one
will show up to your auction.

771
00:42:34,084 --> 00:42:35,881
- Shut up and eat your fin.
- I don't want it.

772
00:42:42,026 --> 00:42:43,516
What, she cried herself
to sleep?

773
00:42:43,594 --> 00:42:46,062
No. I got her to sleep.

774
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:47,597
Where you going
all dressed up anyway?

775
00:42:47,665 --> 00:42:49,633
I'm going to a show with Justin.

776
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:52,294
Aren't you overdressed
for the Dave Matthews Band?

777
00:42:52,369 --> 00:42:55,099
I'm going to a Broadway show.
Thank you.

778
00:42:55,172 --> 00:42:57,663
Where are you off to?
I'm going to meet Kerry.

779
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:59,675
That reminds me. OK.

780
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:01,335
Listen. I don't think
you're ready...

781
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:06,281
but I think it's nicer
than the one you got.

782
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:07,544
You haven't seen the one I got.

783
00:43:07,618 --> 00:43:10,280
No, but Mom described it
on the phone to me.

784
00:43:10,354 --> 00:43:12,413
You guys suck.

785
00:43:12,489 --> 00:43:15,390
You taking her
somewhere special tonight?

786
00:43:15,459 --> 00:43:18,587
Yeah, special. We're going to
her uncle's house for cocktails.

787
00:43:18,662 --> 00:43:20,095
Well, you can go
for one cocktail...

788
00:43:20,164 --> 00:43:21,597
but Dad's taking Aimee,
so you're going to have to...

789
00:43:21,665 --> 00:43:23,064
come back here
and close out tonight.

790
00:43:23,133 --> 00:43:26,569
No. I'm going because
Kerry's uncle knows...

791
00:43:26,637 --> 00:43:28,400
some money guys for Dad.

792
00:43:28,472 --> 00:43:29,939
I understand that.
Listen, Michael.

793
00:43:30,007 --> 00:43:32,134
This is my one free night
to do something special...

794
00:43:32,209 --> 00:43:33,369
with my husband.

795
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:34,672
You're here for one week.

796
00:43:34,745 --> 00:43:36,042
You can't close out for me once?

797
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:38,604
- Lauren, please.
- Michael, listen to me.

798
00:43:38,682 --> 00:43:40,240
I am gonna go
to the show tonight.

799
00:43:40,317 --> 00:43:41,614
Dad's gonna drive
Aimee to Mom's...

800
00:43:41,685 --> 00:43:43,516
and you are gonna close out!

801
00:43:46,156 --> 00:43:49,216
Aimee? How's Papa do this?

802
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:52,319
I'm gonna put the seatbelt on.

803
00:43:56,934 --> 00:43:59,266
Oh, no, Aimee, baby.

804
00:43:59,336 --> 00:44:02,828
Papa loves you.

805
00:44:02,906 --> 00:44:06,000
Papa will be right back, OK?
Papa come back.

806
00:44:06,076 --> 00:44:07,703
I'll be right back.
Wait for me, OK?

807
00:44:07,778 --> 00:44:09,837
Wait. Fine.

808
00:44:15,586 --> 00:44:17,281
Look what Papa's got.

809
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:22,755
We're going for a ride,
little sweetheart.

810
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:24,259
Yes. We're going for a ride.

811
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:26,057
Let's go bye-bye.

812
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:27,597
OK.

813
00:44:29,633 --> 00:44:32,500
We'll go see Nana.

814
00:44:32,569 --> 00:44:34,161
I love you.

815
00:44:39,043 --> 00:44:41,978
This is good, man.
Where'd you get this?

816
00:44:42,046 --> 00:44:43,911
- Yo.
- Mikey, boy.

817
00:44:43,981 --> 00:44:45,573
- Jamal.
- What's happening, man?

818
00:44:45,649 --> 00:44:47,549
What are you doing, man?

819
00:44:47,618 --> 00:44:49,677
Jesus. Come on.

820
00:44:49,753 --> 00:44:51,220
I got to drive
this thing tonight.

821
00:44:51,288 --> 00:44:53,347
I'm sorry, Mikey.
Tommy smoked me out, man.

822
00:44:53,424 --> 00:44:54,755
Tommy smoked you out?

823
00:44:54,825 --> 00:44:55,985
What the hell is
that all about?

824
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:59,223
Go to retail. Get some Lysol,
all right, or something.

825
00:44:59,296 --> 00:45:00,490
All right?

826
00:45:00,564 --> 00:45:02,088
- Come on, talk shop, Mikey.
- All right.

827
00:45:02,166 --> 00:45:03,326
I'll only be one minute,
all right?

828
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:06,301
How are you?

829
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:08,361
I was gonna ask
your father about this...

830
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:10,839
but I figured it'd
be better to ask you.

831
00:45:21,919 --> 00:45:23,250
What is that, Tommy?

832
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:26,118
What do you think?
It's lobster bread, Mike.

833
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:28,090
Yeah, I guess it is.

834
00:45:28,158 --> 00:45:30,752
Hey, my cousin's, like, the head
baker at Astarito's now.

835
00:45:30,828 --> 00:45:32,125
The guy is amazing.

836
00:45:32,196 --> 00:45:34,892
He can make bread look like
fucking anything, man.

837
00:45:34,965 --> 00:45:38,696
Squirrels, puppies, cats,
fuckin' anything.

838
00:45:38,769 --> 00:45:40,327
- That's great.
- Yeah.

839
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:42,031
Tommy, I'm freezing.
Can we go, please?

840
00:45:42,106 --> 00:45:43,733
Honey, just give me
two minutes, huh?

841
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:46,469
You got one.

842
00:45:46,543 --> 00:45:48,033
So I figure, you know, we can
start moving these...

843
00:45:48,112 --> 00:45:49,977
through your pop's store,
you know.

844
00:45:50,047 --> 00:45:51,912
I think your old man can
make some serious scratch...

845
00:45:51,982 --> 00:45:53,745
off of these.

846
00:45:53,817 --> 00:45:55,682
All right.
I'll talk to him about it.

847
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:57,084
- You'll talk to him, Mikey?
- Yeah.

848
00:45:57,154 --> 00:45:58,416
I'm just trying
to help, you know.

849
00:45:58,489 --> 00:46:02,357
I know, Tom.
I-- that's-- I'm speechless.

850
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:04,189
- Ain't their eyes great, man?
- What i--

851
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:05,523
Yeah, they're raisins, I think.

852
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:07,188
- Raisins.
- I'm telling you. He's amazing.

853
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:08,356
Tommy, that's it.

854
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:10,229
- Thanks, man.
- I'm coming, baby.

855
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:13,269
She's gonna be the death of me,
man, I'm telling you.

856
00:46:13,337 --> 00:46:15,999
Here I am, baby. Here I am.

857
00:46:51,275 --> 00:46:53,470
Honey, you've had too much wine.

858
00:46:53,544 --> 00:46:55,535
Oh, Michael, sweetie.

859
00:46:55,612 --> 00:46:57,409
Merry Christmas.

860
00:46:57,481 --> 00:47:01,247
- Welcome to my house.
- You know Fran.

861
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:03,081
Hello.

862
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:05,280
Mom, we're gonna find Chuck.

863
00:47:05,355 --> 00:47:07,448
OK, sweetie.

864
00:47:07,524 --> 00:47:08,650
Merry Christmas.

865
00:47:13,297 --> 00:47:16,027
Come on. Don't leave.
You're my favorite.

866
00:47:16,099 --> 00:47:18,897
It's too early. Come on.
Get the hell out of here.

867
00:47:18,969 --> 00:47:20,334
I'm finished with you.

868
00:47:20,404 --> 00:47:22,964
- Chuck.
- Hey. Hi.

869
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,302
Hi. You know Michael.

870
00:47:24,374 --> 00:47:27,343
Yeah. Lobster Boy.

871
00:47:27,411 --> 00:47:29,072
- How the hell are you?
- How are you? Good.

872
00:47:29,146 --> 00:47:30,374
I don't know.
You're empty-handed.

873
00:47:30,447 --> 00:47:32,005
Where's my lobster?

874
00:47:32,082 --> 00:47:35,245
I told him you brought my dad
some lobster and shrimp.

875
00:47:35,319 --> 00:47:39,016
No. I don't want shrimp.
I want a big fucking lobster.

876
00:47:39,089 --> 00:47:40,215
Maybe next time.

877
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:41,814
No. I'm kidding.

878
00:47:41,892 --> 00:47:44,019
So, I talked to Jimmy...

879
00:47:44,094 --> 00:47:46,824
And he says you want to talk
some shop, a little business?

880
00:47:48,765 --> 00:47:50,460
Let's go out of the noise.

881
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:51,660
All right.

882
00:47:58,976 --> 00:48:00,841
They didn't redecorate yet?

883
00:48:00,911 --> 00:48:02,606
No.

884
00:48:02,679 --> 00:48:06,376
Jeez. It still looks like
the way your mother had it.

885
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:08,816
Yeah.

886
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:14,153
Look. Has Jerry Garcia got
any real booze in here?

887
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:18,126
Canadian Club.

888
00:48:18,195 --> 00:48:19,457
Perfect.

889
00:48:19,529 --> 00:48:23,989
One for me and one
for Miss Aimee.

890
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:27,093
Come here, baby.
Sit with Papa.

891
00:48:49,126 --> 00:48:51,390
You know, Frank,
maybe you should just...

892
00:48:52,963 --> 00:48:54,624
Mama.

893
00:48:58,902 --> 00:49:01,097
Come on, Aimee, sweet girl.

894
00:49:01,171 --> 00:49:02,934
Come on.
I'll bring you upstairs.

895
00:49:03,006 --> 00:49:04,997
Yes, I will.

896
00:49:05,075 --> 00:49:07,043
Come on, love.

897
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:08,202
Very nice.

898
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:11,213
You like cigars?

899
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:13,977
No, not really.

900
00:49:14,051 --> 00:49:15,575
I smoke cigarettes
every now and then.

901
00:49:15,652 --> 00:49:18,382
You should switch.
Cigars are really good.

902
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:19,752
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

903
00:49:19,823 --> 00:49:22,417
Mouth cancer, lung cancer,
same thing, right?

904
00:49:28,665 --> 00:49:33,466
So your your dad's up
against the wall, huh?

905
00:49:33,537 --> 00:49:39,373
Yeah. The bank he got
the loan from went belly-up.

906
00:49:39,443 --> 00:49:41,104
He get the full loan out?

907
00:49:41,178 --> 00:49:44,204
No. And the FDIC's calling
the loan, leaving him...

908
00:49:44,281 --> 00:49:46,476
with a half-finished
restaurant, so.

909
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:48,245
Jesus.

910
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:49,808
Yeah.

911
00:49:49,886 --> 00:49:51,911
Well, he, he's gonna foreclose
on himself and bid...

912
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:55,982
on the property
through my brother-in-law.

913
00:49:58,028 --> 00:49:59,655
Chuck, your mother's leaving.

914
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:01,095
I'll be right in.

915
00:50:01,164 --> 00:50:04,031
- What are you doing out there?
- I'll be right in.

916
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:08,638
So basically,
what you're asking...

917
00:50:08,705 --> 00:50:11,936
is for a private refinancing.

918
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:13,977
Yeah, I guess.

919
00:50:14,044 --> 00:50:16,205
Your dad's shop open tomorrow?

920
00:50:16,279 --> 00:50:18,372
Yeah.

921
00:50:18,448 --> 00:50:21,144
I think I know
the right guy for this.

922
00:50:21,218 --> 00:50:23,186
Oh, thank you.

923
00:50:23,253 --> 00:50:27,587
Yeah, I don't mean to rush you,
but just so you know...

924
00:50:27,657 --> 00:50:29,716
we're down to the wire on this.

925
00:50:29,793 --> 00:50:32,159
So maybe we'll stop by tomorrow,
have a little lunch...

926
00:50:32,229 --> 00:50:33,696
check out the property...

927
00:50:33,764 --> 00:50:34,856
Thank you. That'd be great.

928
00:50:34,931 --> 00:50:37,923
And you better have
that fucking lobster.

929
00:50:38,001 --> 00:50:40,731
Yeah. That's one thing
we got a lot of.

930
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:46,738
Oh, boy. It's getting
cold out there...

931
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:48,801
and it's gonna get colder.
so, cousins, make sure...

932
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:51,279
you get all that Christmas
shopping done quickly.

933
00:50:51,348 --> 00:50:54,044
Not too long
before the big day is here.

934
00:50:56,987 --> 00:50:59,012
Dave, Bill, how they biting?

935
00:50:59,089 --> 00:51:00,317
Not too good.

936
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:02,756
Good morning, Bear.

937
00:51:02,826 --> 00:51:04,487
Good morning, Bear.
I love you, baby.

938
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:07,428
What a shot.
I should have hair like that.

939
00:51:07,497 --> 00:51:12,059
Ipan? Ipan, I'm here.

940
00:51:12,135 --> 00:51:13,295
Where's Ipan?

941
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:16,569
Ipan.

942
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:17,937
Where the hell's Ipan?

943
00:51:18,008 --> 00:51:20,670
Ipan went back home.

944
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:21,938
Ipan went back home?

945
00:51:22,012 --> 00:51:24,173
Yeah, his wife wanted him there.

946
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:29,146
Can I help you?

947
00:51:29,219 --> 00:51:32,746
- What's your name?
- I am Salim.

948
00:51:32,823 --> 00:51:36,520
Salim, I'm gonna teach you
how to make my coffee, OK?

949
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:42,030
All right. Now you got
the hot chocolate powder...

950
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:43,259
- in the cup.
- Yes.

951
00:51:43,333 --> 00:51:44,459
Good. All right.

952
00:51:44,534 --> 00:51:46,934
No. Not the hot water. Coffee.

953
00:51:47,003 --> 00:51:48,163
- Coffee?
- Yes.

954
00:51:48,238 --> 00:51:52,470
Pour the coffee
on top of the powder.

955
00:51:56,813 --> 00:51:58,303
Good.

956
00:51:59,883 --> 00:52:01,646
Hot chocolate coffee.

957
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:09,653
It's good?

958
00:52:09,726 --> 00:52:12,217
It's as if Ipan never left.

959
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:13,922
Thank you.

960
00:52:17,234 --> 00:52:19,065
This paper's all mangled.

961
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:21,661
I'm gonna pay you
only fifteen cents.

962
00:52:21,738 --> 00:52:23,638
What are you talking
about, Frank?

963
00:52:32,282 --> 00:52:33,840
This is cute.

964
00:52:33,917 --> 00:52:36,647
Yeah, I like that one. 12.99.

965
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:37,846
Wow.

966
00:52:39,389 --> 00:52:40,981
I miss you guys.

967
00:52:41,057 --> 00:52:43,685
We miss you, too.

968
00:52:47,964 --> 00:52:50,432
Good lord. This stinks.

969
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:51,967
What stinks?

970
00:52:52,035 --> 00:52:53,593
My sweaters.

971
00:52:55,539 --> 00:52:56,972
It's not that bad.
It just needs to air out.

972
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:59,031
How long were these
in the lobster van?

973
00:52:59,109 --> 00:53:01,043
They were wrapped
in plastic, Mom.

974
00:53:01,111 --> 00:53:02,840
Am I wrong, Kerry?

975
00:53:04,447 --> 00:53:06,915
Yeah, I have to agree.
It's pretty bad.

976
00:53:06,983 --> 00:53:09,383
OK, well, that's that.

977
00:53:11,821 --> 00:53:15,587
Fuck! Shit, goddamn it,
Jesus Christ!

978
00:53:15,659 --> 00:53:17,957
At least he's still
got his faith.

979
00:53:24,501 --> 00:53:28,232
Beth, can I get a clean apron?

980
00:53:28,305 --> 00:53:31,968
- Your dad is pissed.
- Why? What's the matter?

981
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:35,478
Some guys you told to come look
at the place are here.

982
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:37,877
Come on. How good is this?

983
00:53:37,948 --> 00:53:39,108
A little spicy, but it's good.

984
00:53:39,182 --> 00:53:41,013
Wait a minute.
You told me you liked spicy.

985
00:53:41,084 --> 00:53:43,712
I do like it.
I do like it spicy.

986
00:53:43,787 --> 00:53:45,084
Really good.
Get the recipe.

987
00:53:45,155 --> 00:53:47,146
There's that meshugana now.

988
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:49,488
Mikey? Where is he?

989
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:50,719
There he is.

990
00:53:50,794 --> 00:53:51,886
How are you?
Good to see you again.

991
00:53:51,962 --> 00:53:53,259
So you met my son David
the other night, right?

992
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:54,729
No, but I keep hearing
about him.

993
00:53:54,798 --> 00:53:57,733
How're you doing? This seafood
is pretty damn good.

994
00:53:57,801 --> 00:53:58,893
- And that's John Evans.
- How are you?

995
00:53:58,969 --> 00:54:00,061
Yeah, how are you?
Nice to meet you.

996
00:54:00,136 --> 00:54:01,899
- Ritchie Thompson over here.
- How are you?

997
00:54:01,972 --> 00:54:05,931
Hey, enjoy your steamed
extraterrestrials, gentlemen.

998
00:54:07,978 --> 00:54:09,138
That's funny.

999
00:54:09,212 --> 00:54:10,702
So you talk to my father yet?

1000
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:12,839
He said you're gonna give
us the tour.

1001
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:18,178
Don't tell me what you heard.

1002
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:20,951
I know what I said,
and don't te--

1003
00:54:21,024 --> 00:54:24,152
Tommy! Jamal!

1004
00:54:24,227 --> 00:54:25,922
You got to repack Mumbo.

1005
00:54:25,996 --> 00:54:28,226
All halves, nothing over.

1006
00:54:28,298 --> 00:54:32,257
I need it yesterday.
Let's go.

1007
00:54:32,335 --> 00:54:34,997
So this really isn't
a lobster farm.

1008
00:54:35,071 --> 00:54:36,732
I mean, you don't raise
them here, right?

1009
00:54:36,806 --> 00:54:38,967
No. We buy them in bulk...

1010
00:54:39,042 --> 00:54:41,033
and then we keep them
in the tanks and in the wells.

1011
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:42,203
- Wells?
- Yeah.

1012
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:44,110
What do you mean wells?

1013
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:46,512
- Will you give me a second?
- Sure. Yeah.

1014
00:54:50,053 --> 00:54:52,613
Dad, I'm sorry.

1015
00:54:52,689 --> 00:54:55,317
Not good, Michael. Not good.

1016
00:54:55,392 --> 00:54:58,225
I don't know these guys from
a fucking hole in the wall...

1017
00:54:58,295 --> 00:55:00,195
and now they're asking to go
through my books?

1018
00:55:00,263 --> 00:55:01,924
Dad, this could be a good thing.

1019
00:55:01,998 --> 00:55:03,465
Yeah. You want to show
them around, go ahead.

1020
00:55:03,533 --> 00:55:04,625
Look. I know you're pissed...

1021
00:55:04,701 --> 00:55:07,727
but please give them
ten minutes. Please.

1022
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:13,442
This is my daughter Lauren.

1023
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:16,343
- Hello.
- The wizard behind the curtain.

1024
00:55:16,413 --> 00:55:19,644
My granddaughter, Aimee,
now sleeping.

1025
00:55:19,716 --> 00:55:20,842
No computers?

1026
00:55:22,252 --> 00:55:24,413
Well, Lauren is not only
the best clam shucker...

1027
00:55:24,487 --> 00:55:28,548
in Brooklyn but also my
very own personal computer.

1028
00:55:28,625 --> 00:55:30,718
You're in computers,
right, Michael?

1029
00:55:32,028 --> 00:55:33,791
Yeah. They like their system.

1030
00:55:33,863 --> 00:55:35,694
Cash business.
Only way to go.

1031
00:55:35,765 --> 00:55:37,096
Screw Uncle Sam.

1032
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:38,896
Uncle Sam still gets his share.

1033
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:42,370
Is there a water view?

1034
00:55:42,439 --> 00:55:44,498
You said something
about a marina.

1035
00:55:58,988 --> 00:56:01,047
I always wanted a bed
in my office.

1036
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:05,824
It's an office slash
storage facility...

1037
00:56:05,895 --> 00:56:07,658
at the moment.

1038
00:56:07,731 --> 00:56:11,064
How many square feet
is the upstairs?

1039
00:56:11,134 --> 00:56:12,692
3,000.

1040
00:56:12,769 --> 00:56:14,999
Retail and wholesale,
about 7,000.

1041
00:56:15,071 --> 00:56:16,766
Well, it's a fantastic
piece of property.

1042
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:18,933
I bet you got it
for a song, huh?

1043
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:23,068
My father bought the plot
in the thirties...

1044
00:56:23,146 --> 00:56:25,706
so you can imagine.

1045
00:56:25,782 --> 00:56:29,445
Look. I got to get
back downstairs.

1046
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:31,510
The auction's tomorrow, yes?

1047
00:56:31,588 --> 00:56:33,180
Federal court in Brooklyn?

1048
00:56:35,592 --> 00:56:40,723
Yeah. But that may be postponed.

1049
00:56:40,797 --> 00:56:44,893
Oh, really? OK.

1050
00:56:44,968 --> 00:56:47,129
Michael will finish up your
little tour, OK?

1051
00:56:47,203 --> 00:56:49,467
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Yeah.

1052
00:56:53,042 --> 00:56:55,203
Jamal, get me another box, huh?

1053
00:56:55,278 --> 00:56:57,007
- Tommy.
- Yeah?

1054
00:56:57,080 --> 00:57:01,346
Get me another
lumber crayon from the booth.

1055
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:03,579
Dad, I know you might
want to talk about it.

1056
00:57:03,653 --> 00:57:04,779
Please.

1057
00:57:09,392 --> 00:57:11,519
Dad, you want to talk
about this?

1058
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:13,323
There's nothing to talk about.

1059
00:57:18,835 --> 00:57:19,961
Thanks.

1060
00:57:22,038 --> 00:57:27,408
Dad, I didn't know they were
gonna just drop in like that...

1061
00:57:27,477 --> 00:57:29,570
but look, these guys have money.

1062
00:57:29,646 --> 00:57:32,877
And I've got my underwear
on the fucking table literally.

1063
00:57:32,949 --> 00:57:35,782
You know how dumb
this was, do you?

1064
00:57:35,852 --> 00:57:36,944
See, I knew you wouldn't
give it a chance...

1065
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:38,419
so I wanted to give it a chance.

1066
00:57:38,488 --> 00:57:40,581
Even if you have
good intentions, Michael...

1067
00:57:40,657 --> 00:57:43,421
you can't be going
behind my back.

1068
00:57:43,493 --> 00:57:46,826
Michael, it's too fragile
of a situation...

1069
00:57:46,896 --> 00:57:48,830
just to be having strangers walk
on in here.

1070
00:57:48,898 --> 00:57:52,095
These guys stormed
my place unannounced.

1071
00:57:52,168 --> 00:57:54,864
They know about the auction.

1072
00:57:54,938 --> 00:57:57,964
They know about
my fucking weaknesses.

1073
00:57:58,041 --> 00:58:01,204
It was a dumb fucking move!

1074
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:17,753
Oh, are you all done, miss?

1075
00:58:17,827 --> 00:58:19,124
I am, thank you.

1076
00:58:19,195 --> 00:58:20,287
I'm gonna keep my coffee.

1077
00:58:20,363 --> 00:58:21,990
All right. I'll have
the girl come right over...

1078
00:58:22,065 --> 00:58:23,498
to take care of you.

1079
00:58:54,898 --> 00:58:56,559
- Hi.
- Hi.

1080
00:58:56,633 --> 00:58:57,827
- May I help you?
- Yeah.

1081
00:58:57,901 --> 00:59:01,200
I was wondering how much
a room was for the night?

1082
00:59:01,271 --> 00:59:05,207
$65 per night.

1083
00:59:05,275 --> 00:59:10,178
$65 per night?
Per room, per night?

1084
00:59:10,246 --> 00:59:13,613
Of course.
$65 per whole night.

1085
00:59:13,683 --> 00:59:15,207
Whole night.

1086
00:59:15,285 --> 00:59:17,378
What do you think?

1087
00:59:17,453 --> 00:59:18,886
I think that's great.

1088
00:59:18,955 --> 00:59:24,257
I'll have-- I'll take a room
for, well, for a night.

1089
00:59:25,662 --> 00:59:27,493
- Hello?
- Hi, Ms. Miller.

1090
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:29,630
- Is Kerry in?
- Oh, no, Michael.

1091
00:59:29,666 --> 00:59:32,726
She went up to Connecticut
to see her grandparents.

1092
00:59:32,802 --> 00:59:35,600
Oh, that's right.
I forgot.

1093
00:59:35,672 --> 00:59:37,401
Do you want the number
up there, Mike?

1094
00:59:37,473 --> 00:59:41,068
No. That's OK.
I'll call her tomorrow.

1095
00:59:41,144 --> 00:59:43,510
Well, I'll have her call you
if she checks in.

1096
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:46,208
Well, actually I'm staying
at the Provida Motel...

1097
00:59:46,282 --> 00:59:47,442
in Brighton Beach.

1098
00:59:47,517 --> 00:59:51,510
Provida Motel.
OK. Good night, Michael.

1099
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:52,987
Night.

1100
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:02,492
He shoots.

1101
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:06,195
He doesn't score.

1102
01:01:38,461 --> 01:01:40,452
It's not your fault.

1103
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:41,861
I forgive you.

1104
01:01:56,979 --> 01:01:58,970
He's always late.

1105
01:02:12,595 --> 01:02:13,892
Family court.

1106
01:02:25,274 --> 01:02:26,571
Oh, Jesus.

1107
01:02:26,642 --> 01:02:27,973
Who's that?

1108
01:02:28,044 --> 01:02:29,636
It's Kerry's cousin.

1109
01:02:35,351 --> 01:02:36,477
I think so.

1110
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:43,684
Can I help you with something?

1111
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:44,852
Yeah, hey, man.
How're you doing?

1112
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:46,554
- Michael, right?
- Yeah.

1113
01:02:49,332 --> 01:02:51,095
Can I ask you
what you're doing here?

1114
01:02:51,167 --> 01:02:53,601
Yeah, just came to
check out the process.

1115
01:02:53,669 --> 01:02:55,261
Just came to check
out the process.

1116
01:02:55,338 --> 01:02:57,806
Yeah. It's pretty wild, huh?

1117
01:02:57,874 --> 01:02:59,671
Correct me if I'm wrong.
It's kind of like...

1118
01:02:59,742 --> 01:03:01,209
an auto auction, isn't it?

1119
01:03:01,277 --> 01:03:03,211
Not really.

1120
01:03:03,279 --> 01:03:05,611
Hey, there's no worries, man.
We're not here to bid.

1121
01:03:05,681 --> 01:03:07,740
I'm just here
for my own edification.

1122
01:03:07,817 --> 01:03:09,785
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

1123
01:03:09,852 --> 01:03:11,752
Your own edification.

1124
01:03:11,821 --> 01:03:13,220
Well, that's good, because
I don't think it'd be...

1125
01:03:13,289 --> 01:03:14,381
a good idea to bid.

1126
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:15,549
Yeah, we're not gonna.

1127
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:16,853
We might stick around
for a little while though...

1128
01:03:16,926 --> 01:03:18,120
if that's OK.

1129
01:03:18,194 --> 01:03:20,594
- Yeah, go ahead.
- Thanks. Good to see you.

1130
01:03:31,541 --> 01:03:32,667
Don't worry about it.

1131
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:39,971
Parties representing
Block 14, Lot 31...

1132
01:03:40,049 --> 01:03:42,847
D.B.A. Giorgio's
Lobster Farm present?

1133
01:03:42,919 --> 01:03:45,149
Yes, we are, your honor.

1134
01:03:45,221 --> 01:03:47,189
Parties representing the FDIC?

1135
01:03:47,256 --> 01:03:49,952
I'm sorry, your honor,
but as you see...

1136
01:03:50,026 --> 01:03:52,017
we're pretty much
all alone here.

1137
01:03:52,094 --> 01:03:55,393
Once again, we must postpone
due to lack of notice.

1138
01:04:03,472 --> 01:04:05,099
You posted this?

1139
01:04:05,174 --> 01:04:08,769
Yes, your honor. I believe
I posted the D.B.A...

1140
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:10,779
and actual address.

1141
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:12,940
It's a four point font,
your honor.

1142
01:04:13,015 --> 01:04:14,141
Font?

1143
01:04:14,217 --> 01:04:15,707
It's the size of the print face.

1144
01:04:15,785 --> 01:04:17,480
It's so small,
you can't read it.

1145
01:04:17,553 --> 01:04:19,646
We have to set
another auction date.

1146
01:04:19,722 --> 01:04:23,590
We're not setting another date.

1147
01:04:23,659 --> 01:04:25,854
The notice is
in the right section.

1148
01:04:25,928 --> 01:04:27,020
Mr. Giorgio.

1149
01:04:27,096 --> 01:04:29,621
And you didn't specify
font sizes.

1150
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:30,893
Your honor?

1151
01:04:30,967 --> 01:04:33,299
Mr. Giorgio,
please control yourself.

1152
01:04:38,908 --> 01:04:40,842
Mr. Giorgio is correct.

1153
01:04:40,910 --> 01:04:44,038
There was no
minimum print size specified.

1154
01:04:44,113 --> 01:04:45,307
Thank you.

1155
01:04:45,381 --> 01:04:47,372
Don't thank me.

1156
01:04:47,450 --> 01:04:50,146
That was your last charade.

1157
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:53,677
I'm resetting a final
auction date for December 22.

1158
01:04:53,756 --> 01:04:58,250
The FDIC will now post notice
however they see fit.

1159
01:04:58,327 --> 01:05:01,160
That is all.

1160
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:02,424
Thank you, your honor.

1161
01:05:10,573 --> 01:05:11,801
Mikey.

1162
01:05:24,954 --> 01:05:26,581
He was just trying to help.

1163
01:05:26,656 --> 01:05:28,681
It sure did backfire.

1164
01:05:28,758 --> 01:05:31,556
I don't know.
Maybe it's for the best.

1165
01:05:31,627 --> 01:05:33,527
What's for the best?

1166
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:39,591
What's for the best?

1167
01:05:39,669 --> 01:05:40,795
Nothing.

1168
01:05:43,472 --> 01:05:45,030
Four more days.

1169
01:05:45,107 --> 01:05:49,669
Four more till I go
on the auction block again.

1170
01:05:49,745 --> 01:05:51,508
You want me to call my sister?

1171
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:53,241
Your sister?

1172
01:05:53,316 --> 01:05:55,113
To help with the money.

1173
01:05:55,184 --> 01:05:57,846
No. No, thanks.

1174
01:05:57,920 --> 01:05:59,444
I'll figure something out.

1175
01:06:01,257 --> 01:06:03,316
I forgot. You've got those
magical elves...

1176
01:06:03,392 --> 01:06:04,825
to lend you a hand.

1177
01:06:04,894 --> 01:06:06,555
- That's funny.
- Yeah, well.

1178
01:06:06,629 --> 01:06:10,395
Hey, Frank, what happened?
You closing early or what?

1179
01:06:10,466 --> 01:06:12,559
No. I'm opening late.

1180
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:13,795
Merry Christmas, you.

1181
01:06:13,869 --> 01:06:15,803
Merry Christmas.
How are you?

1182
01:06:15,871 --> 01:06:19,534
I'm good. Oh, I've got
a present for Jen.

1183
01:06:19,608 --> 01:06:22,076
You got her a present,
you didn't get me a present?

1184
01:06:22,144 --> 01:06:24,078
You can have Frank.

1185
01:06:24,146 --> 01:06:28,344
A crusty old Italian!
Wow! thanks, Santa.

1186
01:06:33,589 --> 01:06:35,489
Good night, guys.

1187
01:07:05,988 --> 01:07:08,149
Michael, I'm taking the drawer.

1188
01:07:08,224 --> 01:07:09,350
All right.

1189
01:07:53,803 --> 01:07:55,100
Mr. Giorgio?

1190
01:07:57,139 --> 01:07:58,834
I think you're aware
that your son stopped...

1191
01:07:58,908 --> 01:08:01,638
by my little auction today.

1192
01:08:01,710 --> 01:08:03,644
Did he?

1193
01:08:03,712 --> 01:08:06,112
Let's cut the bullshit,
all right?

1194
01:08:06,182 --> 01:08:08,241
Let's cut the fuckin' bullshit.

1195
01:08:08,317 --> 01:08:11,218
All right.

1196
01:08:11,287 --> 01:08:13,312
Your son's name?

1197
01:08:13,389 --> 01:08:14,788
Dave. David.

1198
01:08:14,857 --> 01:08:15,983
You're gonna call
your son David...

1199
01:08:16,058 --> 01:08:18,618
and you're gonna tell your son
David, to back the fuck off...

1200
01:08:18,694 --> 01:08:22,255
from my auction.
Are we clear?

1201
01:08:22,331 --> 01:08:25,562
Mr. Giorgio, my son
is his own man.

1202
01:08:25,634 --> 01:08:28,125
Your son is not a man.

1203
01:08:28,204 --> 01:08:31,105
Your son is
a greedy, little shit.

1204
01:08:31,173 --> 01:08:33,607
Now that was not
really necessary.

1205
01:08:36,378 --> 01:08:38,346
Tell me you're
not gonna call your son.

1206
01:08:41,150 --> 01:08:43,778
Tell me you're not gonna
call your son...

1207
01:08:43,853 --> 01:08:45,718
so I can do what I have to do.

1208
01:08:47,990 --> 01:08:49,082
And what would that be?

1209
01:08:49,158 --> 01:08:52,127
I will rip out
your fuckin' lungs.

1210
01:08:52,194 --> 01:08:56,187
Do you hear me?
Do you fuckin' hear me?

1211
01:08:56,265 --> 01:08:58,062
Yeah, yeah, I hear you.

1212
01:09:50,085 --> 01:09:51,916
Hey, you're home.

1213
01:09:51,987 --> 01:09:53,852
I can't believe you.

1214
01:09:55,624 --> 01:09:57,387
What?

1215
01:09:57,459 --> 01:09:59,791
What's the matter?

1216
01:09:59,862 --> 01:10:01,625
You don't know?

1217
01:10:01,697 --> 01:10:03,927
You don't know
what your father did?

1218
01:10:19,048 --> 01:10:20,140
Hi, Michael.

1219
01:10:20,216 --> 01:10:21,342
Hi, Ms. Miller.

1220
01:10:21,417 --> 01:10:22,679
It's OK, Mom.

1221
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:30,915
Your dad's pissed, I understand.

1222
01:10:33,062 --> 01:10:35,587
Babe, my dad is in a bad place.

1223
01:10:35,664 --> 01:10:37,495
His back's against the wall.

1224
01:10:37,566 --> 01:10:39,796
I didn't know he
was gonna go that far.

1225
01:10:39,868 --> 01:10:42,200
Dad, please!

1226
01:10:42,271 --> 01:10:43,795
I think you should
leave, Michael.

1227
01:10:43,872 --> 01:10:44,998
With all due respect,
Mr. Miller--

1228
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:46,769
I'd like you to leave right now.

1229
01:10:46,842 --> 01:10:48,173
Kerry, can we go
someplace else...

1230
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:49,643
so we can finish
the conversation?

1231
01:10:49,712 --> 01:10:50,804
Good night, Michael.

1232
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:52,642
- Kerry?
- I want you out of here.

1233
01:10:52,715 --> 01:10:54,808
I think you're
overreacting, Mr. Miller.

1234
01:10:54,883 --> 01:10:56,350
Your father comes to my
brother's house...

1235
01:10:56,418 --> 01:10:58,352
in the middle of the night.

1236
01:10:58,420 --> 01:11:00,388
We're thinking about pressing
harassment charges against him.

1237
01:11:00,456 --> 01:11:01,548
Harassment charges?

1238
01:11:01,624 --> 01:11:05,219
Quite a lowlife,
resorting to scare tactics.

1239
01:11:07,329 --> 01:11:10,127
What do you call your nephew
showing up at the auction?

1240
01:11:10,199 --> 01:11:12,929
Is that a lowlife move?

1241
01:11:13,002 --> 01:11:15,368
Because it seems like
a lowlife move to me.

1242
01:11:18,641 --> 01:11:21,075
I'd like you to leave right now.

1243
01:11:21,143 --> 01:11:23,441
Kerry, please
can we go and talk?

1244
01:11:24,747 --> 01:11:25,975
Yes, we can.

1245
01:11:26,048 --> 01:11:29,176
You are not taking one step
out of this house tonight.

1246
01:11:32,821 --> 01:11:33,947
Kerry.

1247
01:11:36,392 --> 01:11:38,587
She's not sixteen years old
anymore, Mr.--

1248
01:12:22,738 --> 01:12:24,433
What did you do?

1249
01:12:30,512 --> 01:12:32,070
I don't want to get
into this tonight.

1250
01:12:32,147 --> 01:12:34,638
No. You are getting
into this tonight.

1251
01:12:39,054 --> 01:12:40,578
Did you put your hands on him?

1252
01:12:43,292 --> 01:12:48,855
Michael, I verbally
spanked the guy. That's all.

1253
01:12:48,931 --> 01:12:50,831
Well, while you were
screaming at him...

1254
01:12:50,899 --> 01:12:53,561
you think maybe you put me
in a difficult position?

1255
01:12:55,671 --> 01:12:56,968
He's a member of Kerry's family.

1256
01:12:57,039 --> 01:12:59,837
So that gives him the right
to fuck with me?

1257
01:13:01,877 --> 01:13:03,401
Why didn't you just
let me go with you?

1258
01:13:05,314 --> 01:13:07,646
There are other ways
to get things done, Dad.

1259
01:13:07,716 --> 01:13:11,243
You do not always have
to be so fucking harsh!

1260
01:13:25,267 --> 01:13:27,167
Michael!

1261
01:13:27,236 --> 01:13:31,297
I was trying to protect
my business!

1262
01:13:36,745 --> 01:13:38,906
And I did what I had to do.

1263
01:13:46,021 --> 01:13:47,613
I know.

1264
01:14:12,514 --> 01:14:14,778
Well.

1265
01:14:14,850 --> 01:14:17,284
Gorgeous.

1266
01:14:17,352 --> 01:14:20,753
I thought you'd never ask me.

1267
01:14:20,823 --> 01:14:22,256
This is gorgeous.

1268
01:14:22,324 --> 01:14:24,258
Which one do you like better?

1269
01:14:26,662 --> 01:14:29,722
This one. This.

1270
01:14:29,798 --> 01:14:32,096
This one. Amazing.

1271
01:14:36,405 --> 01:14:38,305
Thanks.

1272
01:15:21,617 --> 01:15:23,608
Where did you get these?

1273
01:15:26,121 --> 01:15:27,383
I can't tell you.

1274
01:15:31,159 --> 01:15:33,354
Do I even have to ask you
which one you--

1275
01:15:33,428 --> 01:15:35,089
Yeah. Of course.

1276
01:15:35,163 --> 01:15:37,996
I knew that.

1277
01:15:38,066 --> 01:15:39,226
Amazing.

1278
01:15:43,772 --> 01:15:45,763
Did you have a plan?

1279
01:15:48,644 --> 01:15:54,014
Yeah. I did.

1280
01:15:54,082 --> 01:15:55,515
It got messed up.

1281
01:15:58,554 --> 01:16:01,523
Well, you can surprise me later.

1282
01:16:01,590 --> 01:16:03,217
OK.

1283
01:16:16,204 --> 01:16:18,934
Holy shit.

1284
01:16:19,007 --> 01:16:20,235
Tommy!

1285
01:16:21,977 --> 01:16:23,774
The crates are gone!

1286
01:16:33,622 --> 01:16:35,112
Do you believe this shit?

1287
01:16:45,067 --> 01:16:46,432
Michael, can you still
operate this thing?

1288
01:16:46,501 --> 01:16:48,162
You want to turn it on?

1289
01:16:48,236 --> 01:16:50,670
Yeah. Come on, Dad.

1290
01:16:50,739 --> 01:16:54,675
Some of them might have cut
deep into the harbor.

1291
01:16:54,743 --> 01:16:57,371
Don't come back empty-handed.

1292
01:17:06,488 --> 01:17:08,115
There's one right there
to the right.

1293
01:17:08,190 --> 01:17:09,623
Just a little bit, Michael.

1294
01:17:14,863 --> 01:17:16,296
Get the other one, man.

1295
01:17:16,365 --> 01:17:18,629
I can't get out there.
What do you want me to do, swim?

1296
01:17:21,036 --> 01:17:22,594
We lost some. We lost--

1297
01:17:26,274 --> 01:17:28,572
Leave them on the line.
We'll drag them in.

1298
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:30,407
- Watch the front.
- I got it.

1299
01:17:33,115 --> 01:17:35,242
Bring them on home.

1300
01:17:48,864 --> 01:17:50,695
You did a good job out there.

1301
01:17:50,766 --> 01:17:53,064
Looked like
a fuckin' lobster rodeo.

1302
01:17:53,135 --> 01:17:55,695
You ought to sell
tickets next time.

1303
01:17:55,771 --> 01:17:56,863
You gonna see Kerry?

1304
01:17:56,938 --> 01:17:58,132
Yeah.

1305
01:18:00,308 --> 01:18:01,400
Take her out to dinner.

1306
01:18:01,476 --> 01:18:02,636
No, that's OK, Dad. Thanks.

1307
01:18:02,711 --> 01:18:06,807
Come on. Nice steak,
bottle of red wine...

1308
01:18:06,882 --> 01:18:07,974
you'll be right back to normal.

1309
01:18:08,050 --> 01:18:09,540
Come on.

1310
01:18:09,618 --> 01:18:10,949
All right. Thanks, Dad.

1311
01:18:11,019 --> 01:18:12,145
It's all right.

1312
01:18:13,755 --> 01:18:15,188
What the hell is that?

1313
01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:19,092
Here you go.

1314
01:18:19,161 --> 01:18:21,721
Talk to Tommy C.

1315
01:18:21,797 --> 01:18:23,526
Tommy C?

1316
01:18:24,966 --> 01:18:26,456
What the fuck?

1317
01:18:29,204 --> 01:18:30,364
I got the last crate, though.
I just want to say.

1318
01:18:30,405 --> 01:18:31,633
You did get
the last crate, babe.

1319
01:18:31,707 --> 01:18:33,140
She was amazing out there.

1320
01:18:33,208 --> 01:18:34,436
Thank God for
the three of you...

1321
01:18:34,509 --> 01:18:36,807
because I get seasick
in the bathtub, you know that.

1322
01:18:36,878 --> 01:18:39,210
It's ridiculous.

1323
01:18:39,281 --> 01:18:42,580
All the skin curling.

1324
01:18:42,651 --> 01:18:44,118
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi.

1325
01:18:44,186 --> 01:18:45,312
Hi.

1326
01:18:47,622 --> 01:18:50,614
Justin and I were
just making nicey-nice.

1327
01:18:55,163 --> 01:18:57,927
I should go check on Aimee.

1328
01:18:57,999 --> 01:18:59,227
Yeah. OK.

1329
01:18:59,301 --> 01:19:01,064
Good night, Dad.

1330
01:19:01,136 --> 01:19:02,228
Good night, Mom.

1331
01:19:02,304 --> 01:19:04,033
- Good night, Frank.
- Good night, kids.

1332
01:19:10,479 --> 01:19:12,447
So when are you moving?

1333
01:19:12,514 --> 01:19:14,345
First week in January.

1334
01:19:39,674 --> 01:19:40,971
I got to go.

1335
01:19:45,213 --> 01:19:47,113
You want to grab some dinner?

1336
01:19:47,182 --> 01:19:48,479
No, that's OK.

1337
01:19:52,287 --> 01:19:54,414
What's OK?

1338
01:19:54,489 --> 01:19:57,356
Everything's OK.

1339
01:19:57,425 --> 01:19:58,756
Are you OK?

1340
01:19:58,827 --> 01:20:00,260
I'm fine.

1341
01:20:00,328 --> 01:20:01,522
What the hell's going on here?

1342
01:20:01,596 --> 01:20:03,621
What's this all about?

1343
01:20:03,698 --> 01:20:04,960
It's like you didn't know
you were marrying...

1344
01:20:05,033 --> 01:20:06,728
a stubborn bastard.

1345
01:20:08,737 --> 01:20:12,264
You weren't a stubborn bastard
when I married you.

1346
01:20:12,340 --> 01:20:13,500
You were sweet.

1347
01:20:13,575 --> 01:20:15,509
Oh, come on.
We were courting.

1348
01:20:15,577 --> 01:20:18,671
Oh, Jesus, Frank.

1349
01:20:21,283 --> 01:20:22,682
So that's your move now.

1350
01:20:24,252 --> 01:20:25,810
Die alone.

1351
01:20:28,690 --> 01:20:30,089
That's my move.

1352
01:20:33,295 --> 01:20:36,287
There was never any time
for us, Frank.

1353
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:43,661
Maureen, I had
a business to run.

1354
01:21:59,147 --> 01:22:00,375
Yeah!

1355
01:22:02,417 --> 01:22:04,715
Tony got it going, huh?

1356
01:22:04,786 --> 01:22:06,947
Crazy bastard's good
for something.

1357
01:22:08,790 --> 01:22:10,985
You want us to bring
all the crates back in?

1358
01:22:15,196 --> 01:22:18,757
Frank, you want me and Jamal to
bring everything back in?

1359
01:22:18,833 --> 01:22:21,358
You know what, Tom?
I was thinking.

1360
01:22:21,436 --> 01:22:22,562
Maybe...

1361
01:22:23,939 --> 01:22:26,464
Maybe, we bring
just ten in, huh?

1362
01:22:26,541 --> 01:22:28,668
You just want ten? You sure?

1363
01:22:28,743 --> 01:22:31,177
Or maybe--

1364
01:22:31,246 --> 01:22:36,240
No. I think ten is
good right now just in case.

1365
01:22:38,086 --> 01:22:39,678
Today's the big day, huh?

1366
01:22:44,893 --> 01:22:47,054
You look sharp.

1367
01:22:47,128 --> 01:22:50,097
I look like who did it and ran.
You kidding?

1368
01:22:50,165 --> 01:22:52,395
I'll pull those ten, OK?

1369
01:22:52,467 --> 01:22:53,798
Thank you, Tommy.

1370
01:22:55,904 --> 01:22:57,201
I look sharp.

1371
01:23:27,402 --> 01:23:28,869
Let's come to order.

1372
01:23:32,907 --> 01:23:37,241
We'll begin bidding shortly
on Block 14, Lot 31...

1373
01:23:37,312 --> 01:23:40,008
D.B.A. Giorgio's Lobster Farm.

1374
01:23:40,081 --> 01:23:42,948
Terms of sale have been
posted outside.

1375
01:23:43,018 --> 01:23:46,681
The property
is being sold as is.

1376
01:23:46,755 --> 01:23:48,052
There are absolutely no
representations or warrants...

1377
01:23:48,123 --> 01:23:49,454
- That's good.
- That's good?

1378
01:23:49,524 --> 01:23:51,389
I think so.

1379
01:23:51,459 --> 01:23:52,858
as to the zoning
of this property...

1380
01:23:52,927 --> 01:23:55,327
and what use may be made of it.

1381
01:23:55,397 --> 01:23:58,298
If yours is the winning bid,
you will be required to pay...

1382
01:23:58,366 --> 01:24:02,666
ten percent of the sum total
today by cashier's check...

1383
01:24:02,737 --> 01:24:06,036
monthly payments in effect
in thirty days.

1384
01:24:06,107 --> 01:24:08,541
If you fail to close on
the purchase of the property...

1385
01:24:08,610 --> 01:24:10,134
750,000.

1386
01:24:10,211 --> 01:24:13,146
750,000. Do I hear 760,000?

1387
01:24:13,214 --> 01:24:15,045
760,000.

1388
01:24:15,116 --> 01:24:18,483
760,000. Do I 770,00?

1389
01:24:18,553 --> 01:24:20,487
770,000.

1390
01:24:20,555 --> 01:24:22,716
770,000. Do I 780,00?

1391
01:24:22,791 --> 01:24:24,622
780,000.

1392
01:24:24,692 --> 01:24:25,852
780,000.

1393
01:24:25,927 --> 01:24:27,792
790,000.

1394
01:24:27,862 --> 01:24:31,628
Do I hear 800,000?
800,000?

1395
01:24:31,699 --> 01:24:32,961
800,000.

1396
01:24:33,034 --> 01:24:34,797
I have eight $800,000.

1397
01:24:34,869 --> 01:24:38,600
Do I hear 810,000?
810,000?

1398
01:24:38,673 --> 01:24:40,197
810,000.

1399
01:24:40,275 --> 01:24:42,709
I have 810,000.
Do I hear 820,000?

1400
01:24:46,614 --> 01:24:49,344
$820,000.

1401
01:24:49,417 --> 01:24:51,044
Do I hear 830,000?

1402
01:24:51,119 --> 01:24:52,780
830,000.

1403
01:24:52,854 --> 01:24:55,948
830,000.
Do I hear 840,000?

1404
01:24:57,592 --> 01:25:00,584
I have 830,000.
Do I hear 840,000?

1405
01:25:01,963 --> 01:25:03,931
840,000.

1406
01:25:03,998 --> 01:25:07,900
I have 840,000.
Do I hear 850,000?

1407
01:25:12,574 --> 01:25:15,099
840,000 going once.

1408
01:25:17,412 --> 01:25:20,381
840,000 going twice.

1409
01:25:22,383 --> 01:25:23,748
Courtesy call?

1410
01:25:25,854 --> 01:25:30,314
Hearing no further bids,
Block 14, Lot 31...

1411
01:25:30,391 --> 01:25:33,485
D.B.A. Giorgio's Lobster Farm
is now in the possession...

1412
01:25:33,561 --> 01:25:37,895
of Mr. Bill Lau
of Jade Lobster, Inc.

1413
01:25:37,966 --> 01:25:39,456
Thank you very much.

1414
01:25:40,902 --> 01:25:43,462
Mr. Lau, you aware that
within thirty days...

1415
01:25:43,538 --> 01:25:45,904
your monthly payments
will be in effect?

1416
01:25:45,974 --> 01:25:47,965
I am aware, your honor.

1417
01:25:48,042 --> 01:25:50,306
As soon as we get
the restaurant going...

1418
01:25:50,378 --> 01:25:53,404
my Italian partner and I
will be able to pay it off.

1419
01:25:53,481 --> 01:25:54,607
No problem.

1420
01:25:59,487 --> 01:26:02,718
- Is it ready?
- I don't know. It's red.

1421
01:26:02,790 --> 01:26:04,451
Put the lid down.

1422
01:26:17,472 --> 01:26:18,837
- You guys look great.
- Thank you.

1423
01:26:18,907 --> 01:26:20,636
Come on in.

1424
01:26:20,708 --> 01:26:23,541
- Tommy. How are you?
- Good to see you, man.

1425
01:26:34,055 --> 01:26:35,989
So you guys moving back
to New York?

1426
01:26:36,057 --> 01:26:37,217
Looks that way.

1427
01:26:39,060 --> 01:26:41,051
We just have to set
something up.

1428
01:26:43,231 --> 01:26:44,755
Well, you can always work
at Lobster Land...

1429
01:26:44,832 --> 01:26:46,800
until something pans out.

1430
01:26:46,868 --> 01:26:48,859
I figured I could count on that.

1431
01:26:53,041 --> 01:26:54,736
Are you gonna be OK, Mom?

1432
01:26:56,611 --> 01:26:57,942
Yeah, I'll be fine.

1433
01:27:04,619 --> 01:27:05,950
Thanks, honey.

1434
01:27:16,231 --> 01:27:18,028
I have a toast I want to give.

1435
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:21,459
Your father taught me this
a long time ago...

1436
01:27:21,536 --> 01:27:23,663
and I translated it.

1437
01:27:23,738 --> 01:27:26,571
Now it's a very popular
toast in China.

1438
01:27:26,641 --> 01:27:28,268
All right. Chinatown.

1439
01:27:37,452 --> 01:27:41,752
Means, punch me all you like,
you can't knock me down.

1440
01:27:41,823 --> 01:27:44,690
Very, very eloquent, Bill.

1441
01:27:44,759 --> 01:27:47,057
All right, Frank, come on.
Your turn.

1442
01:27:47,128 --> 01:27:48,857
Come on. Boss don't
get off that easy.

1443
01:27:48,930 --> 01:27:50,488
Come on.

1444
01:28:04,579 --> 01:28:08,743
As you know, my life
has been on fire...

1445
01:28:08,816 --> 01:28:12,149
for these last five years...

1446
01:28:12,220 --> 01:28:15,121
but it's not easy
admitting to need...

1447
01:28:17,058 --> 01:28:21,620
but you've all made me
realize there's no shame...

1448
01:28:21,696 --> 01:28:23,186
in needing family...

1449
01:28:24,365 --> 01:28:25,696
immediate family...

1450
01:28:26,668 --> 01:28:30,001
my extended lobster family.

1451
01:28:32,173 --> 01:28:36,234
Now I know I can be
a royal pain in the ass.

1452
01:28:36,311 --> 01:28:39,906
Jesus. I truly don't know how
anybody could be sitting...

1453
01:28:39,981 --> 01:28:43,109
around this table
with me right now.

1454
01:28:43,184 --> 01:28:46,051
I mean, it blows my mind.

1455
01:28:46,120 --> 01:28:51,387
Well, the crustaceans are
getting cold...

1456
01:28:51,459 --> 01:28:57,887
so I'll try to wrap it up
with a simple thank you.

1457
01:28:57,965 --> 01:28:59,455
Unless you want me
to sing a song.

1458
01:28:59,534 --> 01:29:01,365
No!

1459
01:29:01,436 --> 01:29:03,301
Come on!

1460
01:29:03,371 --> 01:29:05,805
And when you're done here,
I want you all to get...

1461
01:29:05,873 --> 01:29:09,274
your hats and coats
and we'll meet outside...

1462
01:29:09,344 --> 01:29:12,836
because there's one more order
of unfinished business.

1463
01:29:12,914 --> 01:29:14,848
All right? Cheers.

1464
01:29:14,916 --> 01:29:17,783
- Cheers.
- Salute.

1465
01:31:54,876 --> 01:31:56,969
Well, we've been getting
some strange reports...

1466
01:31:57,044 --> 01:31:59,308
from the listeners in Brooklyn
about Santa Claus.

1467
01:31:59,380 --> 01:32:01,177
Cousins, it appears
that he's given up...

1468
01:32:01,249 --> 01:32:04,446
not only his reindeer this year
but his sleigh, as well...

1469
01:32:04,519 --> 01:32:06,612
and traded them in for--
ready for this--

1470
01:32:06,687 --> 01:32:08,086
a giant lobster.

1471
01:32:08,155 --> 01:32:09,520
Yeah. I said a lobster.

1472
01:32:09,590 --> 01:32:11,558
Either they've all
gone mad there...

1473
01:32:11,626 --> 01:32:14,220
or someone is making
some really good eggnog...

1474
01:32:14,295 --> 01:32:15,694
in Sheepshead Bay.

1475
01:32:15,763 --> 01:32:17,094
But let's keep things
going here...

1476
01:32:17,164 --> 01:32:18,563
with more of your
favorite hits, cousins...

1477
01:32:18,633 --> 01:32:21,466
and this one goes off to you,
Santa and his claws.

1478
01:32:21,536 --> 01:32:23,766
Did I say that?
Yeah, I did.

1479
01:32:23,838 --> 01:32:26,830
And it comes from Frimpy Irwin
of Ebbets Field.
