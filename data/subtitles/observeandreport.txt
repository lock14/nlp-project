I'm Detective Harrison, Conway Police.

Mark Peoples, I manage the mall.

175
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,773
This is Brandi.
She's the one who saw the deviant.

176
00:13:33,947 --> 00:13:36,278
Hi, Brandi. How you doing? You okay?

177
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:37,779
I'm pretty shaken up.

178
00:13:38,183 --> 00:13:40,243
- Brandi...
- Mm-hm?

179
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:43,048
...I'm here to tell you
that we're gonna work together...

180
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:45,350
...to make sure we catch the guy
that did this.

185

- Did you get a look at the guy?
- Yes.

Do you remember anything specific?

187
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:02,500
Was he tall, short, black, white,

188
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:05,008
- He was white.
- Okay.

189

- Like pretty blond or?
- Sandy, ugly blond.

192
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:13,943
Oh, he had ugly blond.

I think this is good enough for now.

194
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:18,451
All right? The best thing to do
at this point...

195
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:21,024
...is I'm gonna go talk to the other ladies
who saw the guy...

- Ha!
- What? Now what?

is who's gonna protect Brandi.

that she's been targeted here.

Why say that?
What gives you that impression?

202
00:14:35,442 --> 00:14:38,740

and maybe the world.

203
00:14:38,912 --> 00:14:44,213

is some kind of sociopathic genius...

00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:48,183
...who plans on coming back and finishing
what he started, by murdering Brandi.

- It's a pill I'm supposed to take.
- Oh, my God, where did you get these?

667
00:42:25,443 --> 00:42:26,670
From my doctor.

668
00:42:26,844 --> 00:42:28,277
Clonazepam.

669
00:42:28,445 --> 00:42:30,914
That's the good shit. I am impressed.

670
00:42:31,081 --> 00:42:32,981
I did not think you partied like that.

671
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:37,315
God, do I ever party like...
I party like this every four to six hours.

672
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:39,519
Can I have one?

673
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:42,193
- Really?
- Come on, please?

674
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,793
Come on. Ronnie, come on.

00:42:45,195 --> 00:42:46,822
You know what?

676
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:50,059
You can take the whole thing.
Take all of them.

677
00:42:50,235 --> 00:42:53,670
I don't think I need them anymore.
Everything is going great in my life.

678
00:42:53,838 --> 00:42:56,500
Just like it is with you,
and I have this cop thing.

679
00:42:56,673 --> 00:43:00,474

but right now, you know...

You know, that's what I need right now.
I'm on this.

683
00:43:06,317 --> 00:43:10,650
And those stop me from doing that,
so consider those my gift to you, Brandi.

684
00:43:10,822 --> 00:43:12,483
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

685
00:43:12,657 --> 00:43:15,489
- Can I tell you something?
- Yeah, anything. Anything.

686
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:18,628
- I thought this dinner was gonna suck.
- Me too. Why?

687
00:43:18,797 --> 00:43:22,425
I was like, "Okay, weird guy at the mall
asking me out."

688
00:43:22,599 --> 00:43:24,157
Oh, my God.

689

00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:34,733
Yeah, shots. Down the hatch.

You are so fucking gorgeous.

It's been amazing...

...and I think I gotta say congratulations.

We did it together.

giving you a psychiatric evaluation...

721
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:58,811
...to determine if you're competent
to enter into the police academy.

722
00:45:58,989 --> 00:46:01,617
So let's start with your background.
Where are you from?

723
00:46:01,793 --> 00:46:04,818
- Born and raised right here, actually.
- Oh, local boy, okay.

724
00:46:04,996 --> 00:46:07,829
And, Ronnie,
do you have any history of depression...

725
00:46:07,998 --> 00:46:10,159
...or psychosis or anything like that?

726
00:46:10,335 --> 00:46:12,565
Yeah,
but nothing really worth mentioning.

727
00:46:12,737 --> 00:46:14,465
Just a little bipolar disorder.

728
00:46:14,639 --> 00:46:15,969
Not a big deal.

729
00:46:16,139 --> 00:46:20,509
Oh. Well, are you taking
any prescription medications?

730
00:46:20,677 --> 00:46:24,239
I am pleased to announce that I am
currently off all prescription medication.

731
00:46:24,414 --> 00:46:25,780
Congratulations.

732
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:27,884
Why did the doctors take you off?

733
00:46:28,052 --> 00:46:29,246
They didn't.

734
00:46:30,021 --> 00:46:31,579
How are you feeling?

735
00:46:31,755 --> 00:46:32,847
Great, actually.

736
00:46:33,023 --> 00:46:34,581
I met a girl. We're in love.

737
00:46:34,759 --> 00:46:36,521
So that is very good.

738
00:46:36,693 --> 00:46:40,994
I'm this close to catching this pervert,
catching a robber.

739
00:46:41,164 --> 00:46:43,099
Just generally becoming the man.

740
00:46:43,266 --> 00:46:47,795
So at this point in my life, I just really feel
like I could destroy some motherfuckers.

741
00:46:48,873 --> 00:46:50,635
Okay, I'm just gonna write that down.

742
00:46:50,807 --> 00:46:53,072
- Yeah, write it on down.
- Okay.

743
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:56,445
Why do you wanna become
a police officer?

744

That's the big question, now, isn't it?

745
00:47:02,085 --> 00:47:03,985
I have a dream...

746
00:47:04,155 --> 00:47:06,123
...most nights.

747
00:47:06,757 --> 00:47:08,190
It starts on a playground.

748
00:47:08,358 --> 00:47:12,260
And there's kids, you know, swinging,
and they're laughing.

749
00:47:12,429 --> 00:47:16,059
There are dogs barking,
butterflies just flapping their little wings.

750
00:47:17,135 --> 00:47:19,762
And then you hear a rumbling...

751
00:47:20,103 --> 00:47:23,835
...and over the horizon
comes a black cloud...

752
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:25,907
...and it's made of cancer...

753
00:47:26,077 --> 00:47:27,271
...and pus.

754
00:47:27,445 --> 00:47:29,275
It starts sweeping over the playground.

755
00:47:29,447 --> 00:47:31,972
And everyone starts screaming
and clawing their eyes...

756
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:35,244
...and pulling at their hair,
and saying, "Help! What do we do?"

757
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:37,717
And you know what happens next?

758
00:47:38,356 --> 00:47:39,755

the whole world gathers below me...

thank you for helping...

...being a great man
and doing this for us."

"You don't need to thank me.
I'm just a guy with a gun.

...and pay for it...
