1
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,600
Please.

2
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,640
Papa, it's coming!

3
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,080
What?

4
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:01,560
It's the certification of
university. I can go to the
tubingen state on 4th.

5
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,040
- We have to wait. - why?
The certificate is right here.

6
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,680
Well, michaela, you know why.

7
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,120
Yeah, i've been short of
one year study. Now i
will go to the university.

8
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,320
We might need to slow
down. Maybe you can
experience it for one day.

9
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,600
What?

10
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:21,760
Be rational, we've
discussed it for many times.

11
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:25,080
How you deal with... your things?

12
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,320
Mama, those drugs are not useless.
And i've quit it for half a year.

13
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,760
What the doc said?

14
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,040
- Marianne, watch out your
tone. - What the doc said?

15
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,120
- The doc said, it'll relapse - well

16
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,240
so if you were in tubingen...

17
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,560
we should have to cancel the dorm?

18
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,440
- What dorm? - that's it, i think...

19
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,800
if she went to the university, she
had to find somewhere to live.

20
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:02,000
- You helped her rent a dorm? - 
mama, don't be, i am 21 years old.

21
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,480
- Hello - my name is kramer

22
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,200
- michaela klingler - nice to meet
you, your room is downstair

23
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,520
please.

24
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,840
Here it is.

25
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,000
Iook, it's your new home.

26
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,560
- So large a place! - mhm.

27
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,560
And so quiet.

28
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,680
And, there are more
than 100 girls here.

29
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,360
In this wonderful night,
they all went out.

30
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,160
Say hello for me, okay?

31
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,880
Well, i have to go now.

32
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,600
Oh, papa!

33
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:21,120
It's nothing. As a freshman,
you need a typewriter

34
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,320
be careful by yourself.

35
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,240
Thanks, papa, for all you've done.

36
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,920
Good morning! Maybe you
can stand there for a while.

37
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,600
Social pedagogy is related
to the value's spread.

38
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,600
Should find this value
on yourselves at first.

39
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,560
Otherwise, how could
you spread it to others?

40
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,960
Do you believe in pedagogy,
the effection of examples?

41
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,520
- Me? - yes, you.

42
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,440
- Ah, i don't know. - so
what you believe in?

43
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,520
I believe in god.

44
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:59,840
You think it's funny? Please allow
me to ask, what's your belief?

45
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,200
Yeah, you see, and
that's the problem.

46
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,440
Hanna?

47
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:15,480
We were in one class during
high school i'm michaela

48
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,800
- what are you doing here?
- What am i doing here?

49
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,880
- Pedagogy is easy to get
score. - This is my major.

50
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,680
- Where do you live? - the
dormitory in the south quarter.

51
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,920
- Me too. - that's nice.

52
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,000
It's great, right?

53
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,640
Pedagogy is easy to get score, right?

54
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,880
Where have you been? When
i was in 11 grade, you were
still in the parallel class.

55
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,160
- And then, disappeared.
- I left study for a year.

56
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,720
Why?

57
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,800
- Hi. - hi.

58
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,040
- I'm not taking my swimsuit.
- So what? Me neither.

59
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,680
Come on! It's not cold. Man,
you think i'm cheating you?

60
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,240
Come on!

61
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,960
Now it's time for your shower!

62
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,040
- Amen. - amen.

63
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,240
Take it out again.

64
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:09,440
- I want this too. - here is
the place to play music.

65
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,240
The first week is wonderful.

66
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,240
We got a test. I think
i'm pretty good.

67
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,880
- And i met hanna - oh,
she's a student too?

68
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,440
- Father... - it's not
because of hanna.

69
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,640
That's why you came
late. So we shouldn't...

70
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,680
bring you to tubingen.

71
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,960
I wanna go there.

72
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:44,400
- Can't you have a dinner
quietly? - Obviously not

73
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,680
foreknowable saint...

74
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:00,760
the virgin mary, we are calling you.

75
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:06,080
Wisdoms sit up there...

76
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,600
the virgin mary, we are calling you.

77
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:17,280
Mother of god, we are calling you.

78
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,640
Iook, the trees are totally
different. So green.

79
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,520
And tall, got some branches.

80
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,960
It's great that you can
come to have pilgrimage.

81
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,440
- Have i missed once? - no, no!

82
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,360
Upside, you wanna go in?

83
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,520
You can pray now.

84
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,080
- Some one stole things,
look here. - Yeah.

85
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,080
- It's all ancient here. - yeah.

86
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,320
Luigan... luigina.

87
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,200
Giuseppe.

88
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,720
Lilttle angels and roses.

89
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,480
She is so sad... this garland...

90
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,800
what you prayed for to the saint
when you were in the church?

91
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,440
- Only holy will know that.
- Did she answer you?

92
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,360
Mhm. You should listen carefully.

93
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:38,880
When you pay attention,
you will feel her.

94
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,040
Still not mention?

95
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,240
Thanks.

96
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,120
Here.

97
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:04,800
I pray to the god for you.
Hope that he could watch you.

98
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,760
That's so good, thank you. I
won't make you disappointed...

99
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:12,480
i don't wanna hear it!
- Let's talk. - stop it!

100
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,640
Look, a necklace of roses garland.

101
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:39,040
Michaela! Michaela!

102
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,520
What... are you doing here?

103
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,200
Papa!

104
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,480
- Don't know... there
just now... - what?

105
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:54,560
- I heard some noise at
first, then there... - sit up.

106
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:02,640
It's fine that i wake up first,
not your mama. Otherwise
it'll be worse now.

107
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,560
Come on, let's get upside.
While others are still sleeping.

108
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,920
I feel pain.

109
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,800
- So, i will cut. - you sure?

110
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,520
Worse than ever.
Wort be worse, right?

111
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,920
But it's hard to say, right?

112
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,120
Hello, one person.

113
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,200
Have fun.

114
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,040
Hello.

115
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,680

119
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,600

120
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:56,000

00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,480
How about you? -

122
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:06,120
So so, my father got a company

00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,080
i'll inerit it.

124
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:24,920
- I need go to bar there

125
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,360
Let me?

126
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,040
Sorry.

127
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,240
I wanna dance now.

128
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:32,880
Wake up, we are late.

129
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,600
Oh, my godness.

130
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,880
Michaela? Michaela!

131
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,400
Shit, get up!

132
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,080
Michaela. Hey.

133
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:04,480
Hey, come on. Come right here.

134
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,200
- Here. - thanks.

135
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:23,040
How could you say
nothing? Epilepsy.

136
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,640
Because of this you
quit study for a year?

137
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:29,400
- I'm painful, hanna. - 
have you seen doctors?

138
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:34,320
Oh, forget it, you know how
many docs i've been checked?

139
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,720
At last none of them
know how to heal me.

140
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,600
The final diagnose result.

141
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,560
They tried some ways

142
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:48,240
then, they gave you
some pills and then...

143
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:51,480
have new side effect. Must
use new ones to control it.

144
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:55,160
Maybe you should accept this
reality. You are sick, michaela!

145
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,880
Your life is in danger! No
excuse to keep it in closet.

146
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:04,000
- But i feel so ashamed. - 
but you'd have told me first.

147
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,720
Swear to me, you won't let
others know. If my parents
find out, i will faint.

148
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,360
That's over.

149
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:15,280
If you want me to keep
this secret. All right, you
promise me to see the doc.

150
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,560
Michaela?

151
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:40,320
Why you are here? Unbelievable.

152
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,200
You have time?

153
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,640
Mint?

154
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,680
No speaking?

155
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,160
You must think i'm crazy, but i don't
know who else can understand me.

156
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:06,440
If you need my understanding,
you should talk.

157
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,320
In st. Carlo...

158
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,040
i... woke up at night.

159
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,800
Then... i couldn't
catch that necklace.

160
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:24,160
I tried hard to get it, but there
always some strength pulled
me backward, just like...

161
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:29,200
...i was not myself.
Then, it happened again.

162
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,720
This morning.

163
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:36,240
Appeared with ghosts' faces
and sounds, screams i
was shiting on them.

164
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,200
You don't know what
i have experienced!

165
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,360
They came out all of a sudden,
then spread everywhere... i...

166
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,360
wanna close my eyes or, hide
somewhere, but it's no use.

167
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,680
- They kept yelling. - 
what they yelled out?

168
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:57,120
That you shit on them? Or
you can't get the necklace?

169
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,520
- Please don't. - you bring it here?

170
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:15,960
- It's a souvenir of a store. - 
why won't you believe me?

171
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:20,720
You hear what you are talking
about? Ghost face, sounds.

172
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:24,400
What are you talking about? Devils?

173
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,240
We sure believe there are devils on
earth. But we believe in god too.

174
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:32,880
It's just a metaphor, we
should keep to them.

175
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,640
But you can't keep to each word.

176
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,680
- But, father... - ah, so terrible.

177
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:45,400
Illusion! You should talk
to your psychologist.

178
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,760
You are so angry, because
you are afraid too.

179
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:54,000
You know i won't lie to you.
And i can't imagin all of this.

180
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:58,960
You just begin your study,
birds just fly out of the nest.

181
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:04,080
What's wrong with you?
Watch out your own way!

182
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,240
How this way looks like?
Where it'll lead me to?

183
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,400
I thought you could help me.

184
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,840
Many things happened
recently. I don't know...

185
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,920
you need more time?

186
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,760
I feel special during the first
weeks when i left home.

187
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,160
I understand.

188
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,720
Stefan.

189
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,840
- Promise, you'll be with me. - sure.

190
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:45,440
Kiss me.

191
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,840
- You wanna write it
down? - Don't be. - Don't.

192
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:16,320
Clinch, you can try with stefan.

193
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:20,040
- Do we need to study? - 
today is almost passed.

194
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,920
I won't pursue those.

195
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:26,640
- I'll read about one more
semester. - How could
you know you can do this?

196
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,720
From logic, i could.

197
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,720
This one, you don't need to
read. But you might learn
something in highscool.

198
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,440
It's holy katharina.

199
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,160
- She's only 33. - so what?

200
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,920
Hanna, when she was as old as you,

201
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,720
have done many good things i think,
it's not because she is a sister.

202
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,520
She came from a poor
place with her illed body
but she stopped a war,

203
00:28:55,640 --> 00:29:00,240
- when she was 33. - 
oh, here it writes, she
wrote the god's decision.

204
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,840
She fought against devils...

205
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:08,440
...and released the life
when she died. Bla, bla, bla.

206
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:13,400
You don't want to understand me,
do you? I have missed for a year.

207
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:16,840
Hanna, the time, that
you possess of is a gift.

208
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:38,440
All right, it's the time for next date.

209
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,960
You need come to have
x ray next tuesday.

210
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,920
Feel cold?

211
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,200
Please close your eyes.

212
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:10,160
Michaela! We are in the town.
I wonder if we could meet

213
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,400
ah, so coincident.

214
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,160
I'm thinking of the
story you told me.

215
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:19,440
I told it to the father borchert. He
is the parochial assistant father.

216
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,880
How are you?

217
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,680
- Your not believing me hurts me
so much. - I just wanna help you,

218
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,920
when i said you should see doctor.

219
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,800
So, satisfied? Dated with
doc three times, enough?

220
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:38,400
You also wanna tell
me that i'm a psycho?

221
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
I think, everyone
should have a soulmate.

222
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:46,600
- Father landauer wouldn't
make people feel like that. - 
i'm familar with your parish.

223
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,920
Yes, i remember you
are a good missionary

224
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,040
once i should give a cow a peace.

225
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,080
So, you did it?

226
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:00,360
It's gerhards' job.
Kind of simple belief.

227
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:04,280
In hard time, god is like
an insurance company.

228
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:09,800
- Good havest, means this
company is good. - Yes,
people would think of that.

229
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:14,600
I ask myself. Does it mean god's
exist if there's a good havest?

230
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,640
Or someone is illed?

231
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:22,400
People must distinguish which
are real pains which are mess
in mind, and superstition.

232
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,920
What i suffered are all
real. So did the necklace.

233
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,520
I don't know, if the
new pills would work.

234
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,480
Sometimes i got this feeling.
We try to use science
to explain the nature.

235
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,840
These things don't
need explaination.

236
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,720
If someone is really painful
what science should do?

237
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:41,280
Don't we pray for
the god to help us?

238
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,320
Yes, i'm not understand
of this. I can only say...

239
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:48,440
- what i felt, what i experienced.
- Yes, why, i wanna listen?

240
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:51,000
How about things happen
to you, michaela?

241
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:54,040
Because it maybe so
crazy for my illness.

242
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:58,440
The world make our souls
sick. I almost doubt about it.

243
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,400
You know, i don't wanna ask more.

244
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:05,000
I wanna stay her, have
my life. But sometimes,

245
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,840
i feel i can't stop, then...

246
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:11,040
my belief gave me so much
power. You also have you belief.

247
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,760
This belief is more powerful
than the dark things

248
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,880
- but i'm scraed - hands
of god are strong enough,

249
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:23,400
to protect us. While praying,
he's by our sides. - Right.

250
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,160
Let's pray?

251
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,880
Holy spirit,

252
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,720
come into my heart.

253
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,440
Short our distance with your power.

254
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:40,080
Give me the kindness
and fearness of god.

255
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:45,800
Christ, protect me from hurt

256
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,600
warm me with your love.

257
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:52,200
Make me get rid of the burden.

258
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,920
Help me fullfill all my tasks.

259
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,600
Beloved christ,

260
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,320
beloved christ,

261
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,680
amen.

262
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,920
So someone insane, is just like this.

263
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,400
Stop it.

264
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,920
These are your pills, so small?

265
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,520
They said, each pill everyday
no paroxysm for a year.

266
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:26,360
"Grandmaux epilepsie" sounds
like french cheese, right?

267
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:30,400
Shut up i think what you
wrote is hard to recognise.

268
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:39,120
Well, i think it's good, so great!

269
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,760
- All right, if you think
it's ok, it's enough to the
teacher. - That's right.

270
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:47,760
And one title, called: Grasp the fate.

271
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:51,560
- I'm applying the internship
in hamburg. - How it's going?

272
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:55,480
- They hire me! - no way! - it's true.

273
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:01,360
In a kindergarten, leading them to
travel. Setting out after christmas.

274
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:05,480
- What? So fast. - ah, only
four weeks, it's short.

275
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:08,920
Besides you got yours to
be with you. Where is he?

276
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,600
Ha, maybe he still
his mother's babe.

277
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:17,760
- Oh, do i enter the wrong
door? - No, you don't...

278
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:22,640
- oh, why are you here? - you've
been so long not contacting to me.

279
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,480
- Celebrating what? - oh,
michaela is tutoring my works.

280
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,160
- Hanna. - yes

281
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,640
- hello - i know your father.

282
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:37,400
- I'm leaving, bye. - bye,
hanna, see you later.

283
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,760
Come on in.

284
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,960
You lost weight.

285
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,720
Maybe grew a little taller.

286
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:59,800
I didn't tell your mama i came here.
Now she must be disburdened

287
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:04,440
there, came at the
beginning of the week.

288
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:08,200
You use my medicare...

289
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,440
god, michaela, it said...

290
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,800
but it's not suprising, no
matter what, i need a
doctor too in tubingen.

291
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,600
But it's not the same
thing. It's worse than that.

292
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,000
It said...

293
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,840
...you should visit a psychiatrist,

294
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,240
to heal your pyschological
illness. Please don't be like that.

295
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,920
- You got pyschological
problem? - No, not yet.

296
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,440
Michaela, please understand me.

297
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:44,760
You stayed in hospital for
years because of epilepsy

298
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:49,280
- what else could i think?
- So, what do you think of?

299
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:56,600
I saw, you turned better, but...

300
00:35:56,680 --> 00:36:00,520
do you remember, you have
said, when you go to see
the doc, you will lost.

301
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:05,040
- We're all in the hands of
god, papa. - Yes, my child.

302
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,920
It's nice that you are here.

303
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,320
Merry christmas.

304
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,560
Ah, moreover for the student
who wanna be teachers.

305
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:29,400
There's a tiny homework to
do hang on before 15th jan.

306
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:33,560
You will know, while others
are celebrating, the feelings
that you are still working.

307
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,720
Make some effort.

308
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:14,640
- Merry christmas.
- Merry christmas.

309
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,120
- Bye. - bye.

310
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,520
You already come there

311
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:41,120
- michaela! - hello.

312
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:50,200
Ah, be careful, you
make yourself dirty.

313
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,680
Iook.

314
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,240
You think it's fit for you?

315
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:06,520
Meal is ready, pack your luggage.

316
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,760
This is from me. I drew it for you.

317
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:17,480
Oh, my helga! It's beautiful.

318
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,960
- "You think it's fit for you?"
- "You think it's fit for you?"

319
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:29,440
- Hey, don't be so nauty!
- Don't be so nauty! - you!

320
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,960
You a little pumpkin.

321
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,520
- What you bought for your
boyfriend? - Who said to
you i have boyfriend?

322
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:41,080
Who said? You got a
boyfriend, admit it, ok?

323
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:50,680
Hide it under the bed.
That's what i've done.

324
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:54,920
- What can you hide?
- Girls, meal's ready.

325
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,680
Your boyfriend, right?

326
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,520
Silent night.

327
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:04,400
Holy night.

328
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:08,240
Everything sleeps,

329
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,960
only one is awake.

330
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,760
A flute, thank you!

331
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:24,120
- It's so beautiful. - 
you made by you own?

332
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,280
- What's this? - razor,
so fashionable.

333
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:43,240
- Bought in tubingen - oh,

334
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,920
genuine leather?

335
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,760
Thank you.

336
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,640
What's this?

337
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,200
Postman sent it.

338
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,640
- What thing? - from santa.

339
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,720
What is it?

340
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,560
- A goat. - oh, it's so cute.

341
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,080
- Ah, are you crazy? - what's wrong?

342
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,920
- Release me, i've done
nothing! - Where is my stuff?

343
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,560
- I've done nothing, release me! - 
it's silent night, stop quarreling.

344
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,800
- I wanna know where my stuff is.
- What stuff? Are you still normal?

345
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,880
Put them where they should be.

346
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:24,040
- Why you are doing this?
- Get your clothes on.

347
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:29,120
- In the garbage can! - you are a
thief. You'd better remember it.

348
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,960
- Do i have anything to
do with it? - Don't be like
an orphen stroll around.

349
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:35,120
Are you all crazy? Let's go!

350
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,200
- Have you ever thought
what i want? - Be rational!

351
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,880
How long we left?

352
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:47,320
(anthem) a rose.

353
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:55,400
Growing from the earth.

354
00:42:55,800 --> 00:43:02,520
Just like us singing.

355
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:10,520
Christ was born...

356
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:16,200
with a little flower.

357
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:23,520
Michaela!

358
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:12,440
Let me...

359
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:16,440
no...

360
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,080
let me go!

361
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:50,720
Merciful goddess...

362
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:04,320
michaela!

363
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:09,600
- Papa! - michaela!

364
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,600
My god!

365
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,040
Child!

366
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:19,720
- Get the pills! - i can
not pray anymore.

367
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:23,480
I can not pray anymore.

368
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,640
- Hello. - michaela!

369
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:50,240
- Really sorry. Bother you just one
day after christmas. - Come on in.

370
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:01,760
It's so quiet here.

371
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:07,160
Just like the chapel last night

372
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:10,800
- but i pray for you.
- Seemed useless.

373
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:16,200
What i did is not
important. I did wrong.

374
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:20,920
I try my best... to pray.

375
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:24,240
I try my best to be a good student.

376
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:28,120
But they always exceeded me.

377
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:33,080
I almost broke my
mother's necklace.

378
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:36,840
Little by little i understand
the pain that holy katharina
metioned is like in the hell...

379
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:42,320
holy katharina, yeah, she
must experienced many tests.

380
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:46,080
But as far as died, she
connected to the god closely.

381
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:49,320
Because of the pain she
endured maks her to be
the one god selected.

382
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:55,000
May be god forgot me,
i mean nothing to him.

383
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:57,360
He burden the cross for us.

384
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:01,000
He burden the pain and sacrifice
for each. You are no exception.

385
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:04,680
But now, the devil is powerful.

386
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:07,280
I try hard, to conquer it.

387
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:11,680
But why me? I did nothing.

388
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,960
I go to the university. Wanna
my life in perfect order.

389
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:17,760
- But god send the devil to me!
- That's because you are special.

390
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:21,680
You are sensitive
to this crazy world.

391
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:25,200
Let's pray. Last time you did well.

392
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:29,240
No, i don't wanna pray!
Praying is no use.

393
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:32,560
When i wanna pray, you
came. I've experienced this.

394
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:37,920
Why god can't bring me
luck? Am i punished?

395
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,480
God doesn't punish he is trying out
those of his favorites michaela.

396
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:43,120
You knew it.

397
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:47,320
I can only think it as a god's test
otherwise we will be desperate.

398
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:52,440
You can only sit in this
unenlightened devious
place, spread yourself.

399
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:55,280
Then complain that god
is so far away from us.

400
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:59,080
This world is falling if
your praying is useful.

401
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:01,880
Why you just sit and complain?

402
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:06,040
Why you do nothing
about this?! Bye.

403
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:15,200
You at least let me
know who is this?

404
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:19,360
Why you bring us here
the first day of new year?

405
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:23,840
- Stop, papa. - what
else you ask for us?

406
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:27,480
- Can we let you go back to
school? - I forgot to take the pill.

407
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:38,320
I won't do this. I have no power.

408
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:40,920
Do you know, how hard
to fully support you?

409
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,120
You mama sank me into the hell.

410
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:46,560
She is angry everytime. She
knew what god did to you.

411
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,000
Drive.

412
00:48:58,720 --> 00:48:59,920
Please.

413
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:35,520
- Bye, my darling. - bye - you
take care of yourself - ok

414
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:37,520
- bye - bye

415
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:03,320
oh, my god.

416
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:06,240
Hanna?

417
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:13,760
Hanna

418
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:26,560
- my father was drunk
again. - Can i look?

419
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:31,520
- I wanna beer now. - ah, nonsense.

420
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:34,920
Furthermore, it's christmas
stores are all closed.

421
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:37,760
Hallelujah

422
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,600
i'm so happy, it's all passed away.

423
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:45,640
Take the train tomorrow morning.
8 hours late, i will be in hamburg.

424
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:51,760
I should have forgotten these stuff.

425
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:55,360
Can you put off to go?

426
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:58,880
You also said, i
should grasp my fate.

427
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:03,400
I can't tell myself what's
hell the life means.

428
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:11,840
I hear some voice, hanna.

429
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:14,600
What?

430
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:19,760
You can't imagine. I
can't control anymore.

431
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:22,880
I have a feeling. Everything got
in my hands will disappear.

432
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:25,680
Take away my last energy.

433
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:29,600
- Michaela, what are you talking
about? - You can't go now.

434
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:34,360
I don't know what'll happen
next. I'm so scared.

435
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,840
You shouldn't drink so much.

436
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:41,680
Michaela, maybe you should
visit your psychologist.

437
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:48,440
Michaela, wait!

438
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:51,120
God, you can't leave me
along with those crap.

439
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:55,400
I need go to hamburg! I
believ what you said, but
you must believe me...

440
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:58,240
don't say that. Go to hamburg with
your theory as a psychologist.

441
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:34,200
How you are coming! So suprised!

442
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:45,120
I miss you.

443
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:54,320
- You drunk. - don't bother.

444
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:56,680
Come on.

445
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:12,880
Come on.

446
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:55,600
I have to go.

447
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:58,800
Let's stay for a while,
we could drive out.

448
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:02,440
When new semester starts,
we both have no time.

449
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:05,600
I have to write my thesis,
it's a very important test.

450
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:10,440
- It's christmas now, so how about
new year's eve? - I don't know.

451
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:14,040
Bye.

452
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:46,080
At least let me finish
my damn thesis!

453
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:06,280
Please.

454
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:00,200
- Hello? - stefan?

455
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:05,880
You got color tape of typewriter?

456
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:09,320
- Yes - where?

457
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:12,880
There? I speak, you type, ok?

458
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:16,240
- If you can't go on your
thesis maybe abandon
next semester. - No.

459
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:19,040
- It's normal in university. - 
have nothing to do with this.

460
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:21,600
Come on, i'm ready, ok?

461
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:46,680
We'd better start from beginning.

462
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:49,160
"Improve the education of
orphanage with direct vivid ways.

463
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:53,240
End home careness, comma.

464
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:57,280
Marriage, motherhood
comma, help comma.

465
00:57:57,360 --> 00:58:02,720
Must need..."

466
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:09,280
show me.

467
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:22,680
Was i wrong?

468
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:27,480
Nothing wrong, you did all great

469
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:51,720
who can get the high score?

470
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:57,800
If i knew early, i
chose education too.

471
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:00,400
Stefan!

472
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:06,160
Finished?

473
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,200
We need celebrating
it. I take you out.

474
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:17,760
We have sit here for two
whole days. I'm so tired.

475
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:19,960
- You got sleep a little. - yes i did.

476
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:22,840
- You look not like
this. - I go showering.

477
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:25,960
Come right now.

478
00:59:57,640 --> 00:59:59,040
Michaela!

479
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:14,720
Stefan!

480
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:21,280
You can't just leave!

481
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:30,240
The live like those two days
before i can't bear it any more.

482
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:35,760
But the thesis is
finished. It's a symbol.

483
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:39,960
- That i could finish my
school. - It's just beginning.

484
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:43,520
You know what? If you were
just as what you're what
you should do in high grade?

485
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:54,000
Maybe the burden is to much
just like what you'd said.

486
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:11,760
Tell me, what's happening?

487
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:20,320
I can't.

488
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:30,480
I go back.

489
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:15,680
- Michaela - ah...

490
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:31,680
- michaela, we have talked. - yes.

491
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:35,080
We have different
opinion and attitude.

492
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:37,480
Maybe we should chat
in your room it's better.

493
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:41,040
Why? We could talk here.

494
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:43,680
I don't know, something
happened. Iooks so formal.

495
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,720
I think we should pray together.

496
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:49,560
The most important we saw
you better day after day.

497
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:54,640
- Yes, i return good. - even you
don't want, we should pray too.

498
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:58,800
What, are you the father?
"We don't need pray"!

499
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:01,280
Why your attitude is
changing? It's tubingen

500
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:04,880
- it's not yourparish.
- All right, stop!

501
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:12,640
- Here, i'm making my thesis, should
hang on. - Watch out your behavior.

502
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:16,040
I passed the test.

503
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:25,960
I look for shelter for you.

504
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:30,520
Don't make me disappointed.
Help me with your power.

505
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:34,520
- Listen to me... - be
calm down, quiet!

506
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:37,520
You should let me finish the
thesis you all leave here.

507
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:42,480
She won't pray. Karl,
what did he say?

508
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:46,200
- Sorry i don't wanna scare
her. - Give her some peace!

509
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:48,480
Don't use your theory
drive her crazy!

510
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:52,040
We should've done something to
help her. This girl needs our help.

511
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:56,640
- Not the psychologist to
help - you control yourself,
don't be possessed.

512
01:03:56,760 --> 01:03:59,600
You know what's this
called? Exorcise?

513
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:02,160
How many proofs you need?

514
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:05,760
- Bishop got my resolution. - what?

Say your condition is changing
good. Say you learnt alot,
say you got lots works to do.

520
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:28,600
Say you took the pills say
those people are talking shit.

521
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:32,720
Say you just tired.
Say you need sleep.

522
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:37,200
- Right, things like what
you said. - See... it is so.

523
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:40,560
- Yes, papa, you are right.
Papa - well, my child.

524
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:43,640
Ok, we don't stay here anymore.

525
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:55,200

531
01:05:55,960 --> 01:05:57,160
Hello.

532
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:00,040
- Why you don't meet
me? - You don't drink.

533
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:04,240
You wanna drink some? I bring
you something. Really? Ok

534
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:09,400

535
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:13,360
Okay, tell what's the hell with
michaela? Something happened?

01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:15,920
- What's up? - you check!

537
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:19,320
She lost weight. Follow me.

538
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,200
I don't know what' wrong with her.

539
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:28,240
I think that thing has gone.

540
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:33,280
- I can't go on. - we don't discuss
you, we discuss other things!

541
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:36,600
- So what's that? - the things
from the university to
the clinic of psychologist.

542
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:40,360
She didn't mention to you?

543
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:54,920
- You are not visit the
doc, aren't you? - So what?

544
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:58,960
If you don't wanna go along.
I'll be with you, i'd love to.

545
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:01,840
I wanna go to san carlo
where holy katharina lived.

546
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:04,240
- I wanna pray for
others. - God, stop it.

547
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:08,200
And your weird holy sister!
You wanna end like this?

548
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:12,760
- Michaela, i don't wanna
wait you back - yes, i know.

549
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:17,120
Stefan, do we plan to go out
together? You always want to.

550
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:22,720
- Why need hanna tell me,
what happened? - Stop it.

551
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:26,920
You promised to be with me. You
will go with me to italy, right?

552
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:31,600
Now... like this i don't
think it's a good idea.

553
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:34,640
- You said you'll be with
me, did you? - Michaela,
come over, calm down.

554
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:37,080
- You promised to keep the secret,
what did you say to him? - Nothing

555
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:41,160
- i ask you, what you talk
about me? - Michaela, enough!

556
01:07:57,040 --> 01:08:00,400
I call the hospital right
now, you stay here?

557
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:16,240
- What's wrong? - you need
eat something, a little.

558
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:23,080
I don't wanna go to the hospital.
You should promise me...

559
01:08:23,160 --> 01:08:27,240
- you won't send me to the
hospital. - Docs will help you.

560
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:32,760
How? I can't even hold the
cross do you understand?

561
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:44,520
I can't even move, look.

562
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:57,720
See? Like that.

563
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:17,920
Good.

01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:35,720

- I can't send her to there. - stefan.

567
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:21,280
Mr. Klingler?

01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:27,000
You gotta help me michaela,
she is sleeping. - What?

569
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:09,320
Karl?

570
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:16,120
She made trouble all night.
And will be awake soon.

571
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:22,480
- Is it michaela? - go
back to your room.

572
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:25,360
Do you hear it?

573
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:39,200
You must know some
doc could cure her.

574
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:44,520
- We don't wanna send her
to the hosptal like this. - Let
doc check her, that's right.

575
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:03,720
Here is writtern, she
maybe has psycho problem.

576
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:06,680
Should send to the hospital.

577
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:09,000
What's this?

578
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:13,360
I should have done something first.

579
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:17,360
A good clinic will be helpful.

580
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:21,160
No one is good. Michaela
knows it deeply.

581
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:25,680
Useless at last. But now
she must visit some doc.

582
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:30,040
- Why you don't mention a word?
- I wanna give her a chance.

583
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:33,600
- I won't go to the
hospital. - Sit down.

584
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:37,640
They won't find anything.
My problem, can't be
found even under x ray.

585
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:39,320
Eat.

01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,840
You always knew, you saw it.

01:12:59,720 --> 01:13:01,680
So go.

01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:15,120
Michaela, you go up along.

592
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:21,280
Open the door.

593
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:25,240
Now make me some food!

594
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:28,000
Don't think this shit
could treat me well.

595
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:31,640
Oh, my god.

596
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:33,520
Open, open the door!

01:13:47,320 --> 01:13:50,120
- You should go to
the hospital. - Yeah.

Pray with her, maybe

601
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:07,440

Don't cheat on me.

Those pills, and others, no help.

No use from beginning.

Don't touch me, leave me

614
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:24,240

I beg god forgive you.

639
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:05,760
In the trial court.

640
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:10,600
In the human world,

641
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:14,640
- Say, who take your spirit
away? - No, i won't tell.

642
01:18:14,720 --> 01:18:17,280
- For the god's sake. - no!

643
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:19,640
- Say, say! - no!

01:18:23,680 --> 01:18:26,640
- No!!! - say!

646

All right.

647
01:18:50,680 --> 01:18:53,960
I'm so sad, mama i make
you suffer so much.

648
01:18:54,200 --> 01:18:55,640
- Sleep. - yes.

649
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:57,840
Papa

01:19:05,720 --> 01:19:08,520

651
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:14,800
can you send greets to hanna?
Don't make her worry. - Ok.

652
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:23,680
Michaela.

653
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:31,440
You won't leave me along.

654
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:36,080
- The devils will leave,
won't they? - Yes.

655
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:40,600
If it doesn't work we go
to pilgrimage, to where
holy katharina lived.

656
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:45,640
Think of her. She has
endured this huge pain.

657
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:50,120
But the devils never stop.

658
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:53,120
Katharina, it's only the expiation.

659
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:56,040
She endured the pain
for the greater target.

660
01:19:56,920 --> 01:20:02,520
- A martyr - yes, but you
shouldn't think of that.

661
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:21,200
- I will come 5 mins later.
- I said, she is sleep.

662
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:23,760
If you won't let me in, i will ask
all the people in town coming out.

663
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:25,520
Let her in.

664
01:20:39,160 --> 01:20:44,600
Father said, now she is in
danger. Sometimes she cursed.

665
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:47,840
Means she is possessed.

666
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:54,120
Michaela.

667
01:20:54,720 --> 01:21:00,080
If lucky enough, she will
wake up father come at 4: 30.

668
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:15,400
Michaela.

669
01:21:33,240 --> 01:21:35,840
How did you come?

670
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:40,280
How things going on in tubingen?

671
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:43,640
You're not there, no fun.

672
01:21:44,360 --> 01:21:47,880
What time is it? If
father would come?

673
01:21:47,960 --> 01:21:51,440
I just wanna go with
you. Only two of us.

674
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:53,960
We breathe some fresh air ok?

675
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:09,080
What's the matter?
Where are you going?

676
01:22:09,160 --> 01:22:11,880
We jus hang around. Drive the car.

677
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:15,200
Not so long.

678
01:22:22,640 --> 01:22:26,440
- You have been here? - 
never, it's so beautiful.

679
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:35,800
Iook, the fields look
like table cloth.

680
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:38,560
- Ok? - yeah.

681
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:47,880

682
01:22:55,560 --> 01:22:57,920

683
01:23:01,040 --> 01:23:03,360
Tubingen. Us.

684
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:06,120
Whatever.

685
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:09,400

future? - Until it leave us.

687
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:17,360
Ah, no, it won't leave you along.
Because it's never leave your body.

688
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:20,560
Your body only has
yourself, yourself.

689
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:24,880

691
01:23:33,880 --> 01:23:36,120
It; s all have reasons of these things.

692
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:39,920
I suffer this pain for
some better things.

693
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:45,320

01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:48,520
Michaela, wath out what you
