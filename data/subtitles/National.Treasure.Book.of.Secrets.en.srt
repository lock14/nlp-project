- Gates.

169
00:12:29,634 --> 00:12:31,158
How did you get in, Ben?

170
00:12:34,406 --> 00:12:36,772
Riley! Come out here!

171
00:12:39,244 --> 00:12:40,836
What? (LAUGHS)

172
00:12:42,747 --> 00:12:47,047
Hey! What are you doing here?
I mean, it's your house, but...

173
00:12:47,118 --> 00:12:50,144
I sent you a copy of my book.
Did you get a chance?

174
00:12:50,222 --> 00:12:53,248
- No, I haven't read it yet.
- Mm.

175
00:12:53,725 --> 00:12:56,319
I know you.
You're the White House curator.

176
00:12:56,394 --> 00:13:00,956
- I'm Riley. We met, uh, back in...
- Right. You're, uh, Ben's assistant.

177
00:13:01,266 --> 00:13:02,699
What?

178
00:13:02,767 --> 00:13:05,361
Um, maybe I should go.

179
00:13:05,437 --> 00:13:09,066
- Yeah, I'm really...
- Dinner tomorrow night?

180
00:13:09,741 --> 00:13:12,369
I... I actually already
have plans for tomorrow.

181
00:13:12,444 --> 00:13:13,706
You do?

182
00:13:14,913 --> 00:13:17,643
- Of course you do.
- But I'm free on Friday.

183
00:13:17,716 --> 00:13:20,810
- Awkward.
- Oh, great. (LAUGHS)

184
00:13:22,387 --> 00:13:24,014
- Good night.
- Good night.

185
00:13:24,923 --> 00:13:27,289
I cannot believe you broke in.

186
00:13:27,359 --> 00:13:29,953
- What did you take?
- It's just my things.

187
00:13:31,529 --> 00:13:32,723
Hand it over, Ben.

188
00:13:32,797 --> 00:13:35,357
(SIGHS) I need to see
the Booth diary page.

189
00:13:35,433 --> 00:13:39,233
You saw the page yourself.
There is no treasure map on it.

190
00:13:39,304 --> 00:13:43,104
No, it's a cipher leading to a map.
Anyone spectral-image the page?

191
00:13:43,174 --> 00:13:46,473
No need to. The ink writing
on the page is clearly visible.

192
00:13:46,544 --> 00:13:48,739
It could have been erased or faded.

193
00:13:48,813 --> 00:13:52,271
You're the director of document
conservation. You know this.

194
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:54,341
Not up to me.
It's not my department.

195
00:13:54,419 --> 00:13:56,944
That department reports
to your department.

196
00:13:57,055 --> 00:13:59,319
Come on. One look under infrared.

197
00:13:59,357 --> 00:14:01,348
You can have the Boston Tea Tables.

198
00:14:07,198 --> 00:14:08,495
Both of them?

at this page for hours.

201
00:14:14,673 --> 00:14:16,265
There's nothing there.

202
00:14:17,108 --> 00:14:21,545
Ben, I really don't think we're
going to find anything on this page.

203
00:14:21,613 --> 00:14:24,047
In a hundred years,
no one's going to remember

204
00:14:24,115 --> 00:14:27,414
anyone involved in the Lincoln
assassination besides Booth.

205
00:14:27,485 --> 00:14:31,649
That's not true. Do you know
the expression, "His name is mud"?

206
00:14:31,756 --> 00:14:33,747
- Yes. Of course.
- You do?

207
00:14:33,825 --> 00:14:38,762
- You know the origin of the expression?
- Does anyone but you?

208
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:42,493
Dr. Samuel Mudd was convicted
of being a co-conspirator

209
00:14:42,567 --> 00:14:46,230
in the Lincoln assassination.
The evidence was circumstantial.

210
00:14:46,304 --> 00:14:49,102
He was later pardoned,
but it didn't matter.

211
00:14:49,174 --> 00:14:53,941
Mudd's name still lives in infamy. And I
will not let Thomas Gates' name be mud.

212
00:14:56,348 --> 00:14:58,077
- ABIGAIL: Ben.
- What?

213
00:14:58,183 --> 00:14:59,548
Look at this.

214
00:15:00,785 --> 00:15:03,310
- See that?
- Oh.

215
00:15:03,388 --> 00:15:08,155
- That's quite something, isn't it?
- Yeah. It says "smudge."

216
00:15:09,027 --> 00:15:10,358
It's nothing.

217
00:15:13,231 --> 00:15:16,098
Residual ink
from the facing page. Flip it.

218
00:15:16,768 --> 00:15:18,599
The letters are backwards.

219
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:20,661
- It's a cipher.
- Yes. It is.

220
00:15:20,739 --> 00:15:23,037
A cipher.
See how the letters are coupled?

221
00:15:23,108 --> 00:15:28,876
Playfair ciphers encode letters
in pairs. This could prove his story.

222
00:15:28,947 --> 00:15:33,350
Unless you decode the cipher,
this does not prove a theory.

223
00:15:33,418 --> 00:15:35,648
That's OK.
We need a five-letter keyword.

224
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,018
- What's the keyword?
- I don't know yet.

Dr. Nichols from announcing
the discovery of the page tomorrow.

231
00:15:56,775 --> 00:16:01,576
No, now, wait. Can't you ask him to
wait until I prove Thomas is innocent?

232
00:16:02,947 --> 00:16:04,608

- Now we're a bunch of crazies.
- But we're not liars.

was a mastermind to one of
the darkest hours in U.S. History.

267

And he burned the diary page
to cover that up.

You and I both know he burned the page

from finding the treasure.

- Find the treasure.

going to help me find it. So come on.

- Got all that. Anything after that?

with his dying breath,

- Fascinated by it.

My family's descended from

Confederate General Albert Pike.
He was a remarkable man.

338
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:39,277
But, then again, what is history but
a marker for the deeds of great men?

339
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:44,515
A man only has one lifetime,
but history can remember you forever.

340
00:21:44,589 --> 00:21:47,752

which Statue of Liberty?

one in the Luxembourg Garden.

Yes. Thank you.

Are those for the queen?

507

Queen's not here. There's
no flag flying. Queen's at Windsor.

508

- See the desk, without you.

Will you give me
the flowers back, please?

514
00:32:25,429 --> 00:32:26,487
Yeah.

515
00:32:32,569 --> 00:32:36,266
- What?
- Wearing the perfume I bought you.

516
00:32:37,141 --> 00:32:38,130
So?

517
00:32:38,776 --> 00:32:40,971
So I think it smells kind of pretty.

518
00:32:41,812 --> 00:32:44,975
- It's the flowers, Ben.
- No, it's not.

522
00:33:06,003 --> 00:33:09,370

- Good. Good.

ABIGAIL: The Resolute desk.

526
00:33:27,791 --> 00:33:29,156
We're looking for...

527
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:35,061
...writing, patterns in the carvings.
Could be anything.

528
00:33:38,569 --> 00:33:39,934
Hey, look at this.

00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:48,139
- "Malcolm Gilvary, 1880."
- Hold on one second.

530
00:33:48,912 --> 00:33:53,372
Here we go. Malcolm Gilvary.
He didn't make furniture.

531
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:56,544
<i>He made Chinese puzzle boxes.</i>

532
00:34:04,461 --> 00:34:05,985

- What?

533
00:34:07,097 --> 00:34:11,659
I think these drawers
work like tumblers in a safe.

534
00:34:11,735 --> 00:34:15,262
OK, four drawers...
Four-digit combination?

535
00:34:16,206 --> 00:34:17,298
What about a year?

536
00:34:17,374 --> 00:34:22,107
Uh, let me see.
Queen Victoria, born 1819.

537

So you go one...

538
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:27,939

- OK... 1876 was on the inscription

<i>on the statue in Paris. Let's try that.</i>

543

I mean, this looks centuries older
than Civil War.

553
00:35:45,629 --> 00:35:49,156

with the plot to assassinate Lincoln.

I can't read the whole thing,

634
00:43:35,965 --> 00:43:39,457
these are definitely pre-colonial
Native American markings.

- Easily.

That's Cíbola.

00:44:01,357 --> 00:44:03,257
The City of Gold.

642
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:05,122
The City of Gold.

643
00:44:08,098 --> 00:44:12,125
BEN: "In 1527, a Spanish ship
wrecked on the Florida coast.

644
00:44:12,202 --> 00:44:14,067
There were only four survivors.

645
00:44:14,137 --> 00:44:19,131
One was a slave named Estebán
who saved a local tribe's dying chief.

646
00:44:19,209 --> 00:44:22,042
As a reward,
he was taken to their sacred city,

647
00:44:22,112 --> 00:44:24,012
a city built from solid gold.

648
00:44:25,982 --> 00:44:30,043
Later, when Estebán tried to find
the city again, he never could.

649
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:35,752
But the legend grew, and every explorer
came to the New World in search of it.

650
00:44:36,693 --> 00:44:40,652
When General Custer's search for gold
ended with his last stand

651
00:44:40,730 --> 00:44:45,167
at Little Bighorn, it became clear
none would ever find it."

652
00:44:50,807 --> 00:44:55,540
Ben, can you imagine if the Confederates
got their hands on the City of Gold...

653
00:44:56,279 --> 00:44:57,746

No one better.

659
00:45:14,797 --> 00:45:17,789
- Who?
- Look, Ben, I can't go with you.

660
00:45:17,867 --> 00:45:21,064
- It's been, what? Twenty-five years.
- Thirty-two.

That long?

662
00:45:24,707 --> 00:45:28,404
There's a reason
why we haven't spoken in 32 years.

663
00:45:28,478 --> 00:45:31,174
- We have nothing in common.
- Me?

664
00:45:31,848 --> 00:45:35,682
Yes, of course. And I'm sure
she's just as proud of you as I am.

665
00:45:35,752 --> 00:45:38,152
- Who?
- His mom.

666
00:45:41,124 --> 00:45:45,254
- Will you relax? It's gonna be fine.
- Sure. Should look at the bright side.

667
00:45:45,328 --> 00:45:49,094
Been a long time. Maybe she
lost her memory, won't recognize me.

668
00:45:49,933 --> 00:45:51,332
I hate her!

669
00:45:53,336 --> 00:45:54,860
We're in the right place.

670
00:45:58,007 --> 00:46:01,170
I'm gonna take myself
out of the line of fire for this one.

671
00:46:01,244 --> 00:46:03,075
- BEN: Hi, Mom.
- WOMAN: Benjamin!

672
00:46:03,146 --> 00:46:06,309
Abigail! What a surprise!
Hello, sweetheart.

673
00:46:06,382 --> 00:46:07,371
Hi.

674
00:46:08,618 --> 00:46:09,607
Oh.

675
00:46:11,321 --> 00:46:14,813
You see? One syllable,
a knife in the heart.

676
00:46:14,891 --> 00:46:16,756
- Oh, no.
- She can do that.

677
00:46:16,826 --> 00:46:19,693
I can also track the whereabouts
of my toothbrush.

678
00:46:19,762 --> 00:46:22,754
I was not the one that left
the toothbrushes in Marrakech.

679
00:46:22,832 --> 00:46:25,801
I stowed them both
in the travel case, as instructed.

680
00:46:25,868 --> 00:46:29,998
Yes, and you also insisted
on loading the luggage into the taxi.

681
00:46:30,073 --> 00:46:33,167
- Didn't insist. I loaded the luggage.
- Not the travel case.

682
00:46:33,243 --> 00:46:36,440
Travel case is not luggage.
The case goes into the luggage.

683
00:46:36,512 --> 00:46:39,879
- Who was in charge of packing?
- I couldn't get the case into

684
00:46:39,949 --> 00:46:43,009
the luggage. It was full
with that stupid rug you bought.

685
00:46:43,086 --> 00:46:45,179
You thought it had secret stitching.

686
00:46:45,255 --> 00:46:47,689
- How stupid was that?
- Did have stitching.

687
00:46:47,757 --> 00:46:51,124
- Six phony green leather suitcases...
- Mom.

688
00:46:53,429 --> 00:46:55,420
I need you to take a look at this.

689
00:46:56,599 --> 00:46:59,124
- What is that a picture of?
- It's interesting.

690
00:46:59,235 --> 00:47:01,726
- We think it might be Olmec.
- It is.

691
00:47:03,006 --> 00:47:05,531
Yes, yes, definitely proto-Zoquean.

692
00:47:05,608 --> 00:47:08,771
We were hoping
that you could translate it.

693
00:47:09,512 --> 00:47:11,104
Yes, of course you were.

694
00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:17,283
Oh, this doesn't involve
another treasure hunt, does it?

695
00:47:17,353 --> 00:47:20,151
Mom, this is actually very important.

696
00:47:22,125 --> 00:47:24,559
All right. What have we got here?

697
00:47:25,295 --> 00:47:29,994
This... this glyph here,
that means "bird." And that means...

698
00:47:35,938 --> 00:47:37,064
Uh, "noble bird."

699
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:40,337
"Find the noble bird,
let him take you by the hand

700
00:47:40,410 --> 00:47:43,675
and give you passage
to the sacred temple."

701
00:47:46,582 --> 00:47:48,675
(LAUGHS)

702
00:47:50,386 --> 00:47:53,549
Oh, you think this is a treasure map
for Cíbola, don't you?

703
00:47:54,090 --> 00:47:55,955
Well, that is exactly what it is.

704
00:47:56,025 --> 00:48:00,155
No, this glyph doesn't mean "Cíbola."
It means "the center of the world."

705
00:48:00,263 --> 00:48:04,131
You know, you used to like it. She
fell in love with me on a treasure hunt.

706
00:48:04,167 --> 00:48:07,898
That was not love. That was
excitement, adrenaline and tequila.

707
00:48:07,970 --> 00:48:09,767
- BEN: Mom...
- I was trying to get course credit.

708
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:13,366
Treasure hunting paid off,
in case you haven't read the papers.

709
00:48:13,443 --> 00:48:15,604
Had nothing to do with you.
That was Ben.

710
00:48:15,678 --> 00:48:17,976
Ben found the treasure.
You did nothing.

711
00:48:18,047 --> 00:48:22,950
Patrick, Emily, please. Can we
just figure out what's on the page?

712
00:48:25,588 --> 00:48:27,249
Well, that's it, I'm afraid.

713
00:48:27,957 --> 00:48:32,155
These glyphs are only partials.
So you only have half a treasure map.

714
00:48:33,296 --> 00:48:34,558
I'm sorry.

715
00:48:35,365 --> 00:48:36,832
Not that I'm surprised.

716
00:48:38,901 --> 00:48:41,392
BEN: At least we know
where the rest of the map is.

717
00:48:42,038 --> 00:48:43,369
What?

718
00:48:43,873 --> 00:48:46,205
You know where it is?
Why didn't you tell me?

719
00:48:46,275 --> 00:48:48,937
Obviously you have
a tendency to overreact!

720
00:48:52,615 --> 00:48:55,516
- I'm sorry.
- So am I.

721
00:48:55,585 --> 00:48:57,075
So where is it?

722
00:48:57,186 --> 00:49:01,782
Inscription on the statue in Paris said,
"These twins stand resolute."

723
00:49:01,824 --> 00:49:05,351
We think the map's divided
between the two Resolute desks.

724
00:49:05,428 --> 00:49:08,955
The Resolute desk.
The Resolute desk?

725
00:49:09,031 --> 00:49:10,931
President's desk?

726
00:49:11,567 --> 00:49:13,330
The president. What president?

727
00:49:13,403 --> 00:49:16,338
- Our president?
- Unfortunately, yes.

728
00:49:16,406 --> 00:49:17,930
But that means...

729
00:49:18,007 --> 00:49:19,338
Wait, so we have to...

730
00:49:20,643 --> 00:49:21,803
The White House?

731
00:49:23,146 --> 00:49:26,673
The Oval Office... to be exact.

732
00:49:29,285 --> 00:49:31,082
Why would I overreact to that?

733
00:49:35,758 --> 00:49:39,592
- That's not what I signed on for.
- Could we focus on the issue at hand?

734
00:49:41,731 --> 00:49:42,720
Thank you.

735
00:49:46,669 --> 00:49:48,660
NICHOLS: It's early, pre-Columbian.

736
00:49:48,738 --> 00:49:51,002
- Can you translate it?
- Are you kidding?

737
00:49:51,073 --> 00:49:54,372
This is an extinct,
exceedingly rare language.

738
00:49:54,444 --> 00:49:57,242
Only a handful of people
study these languages.

739
00:49:57,313 --> 00:49:58,712
Where are we to find them?

740
00:49:59,415 --> 00:50:02,782
Universities, I suppose.
But you don't have the whole thing.

741
00:50:02,852 --> 00:50:03,841
What do you mean?

742
00:50:04,587 --> 00:50:08,148
These glyphs here... they're cut off.

743
00:50:08,224 --> 00:50:11,394
There's more to the map?
How are we going to find that?

744
00:50:11,394 --> 00:50:14,329
We won't have to.
Gates will get it somehow.

745
00:50:14,664 --> 00:50:19,067
The Resolute desk is near
the south wall in the Oval Office.

746
00:50:19,135 --> 00:50:21,330
Look at this. Look.

747
00:50:21,404 --> 00:50:23,269
Small door on the front of the desk.

748
00:50:23,339 --> 00:50:26,797
PATRICK: FDR had that put in so
guests couldn't see his wheelchair.

749
00:50:26,876 --> 00:50:29,777
- But...
- Guys, take a look at this.

750
00:50:31,614 --> 00:50:33,047
ABIGAIL: This could work.

751
00:50:33,115 --> 00:50:36,846
I believe it's time for you to make
a date with your new boyfriend.

752
00:50:38,221 --> 00:50:39,381
I think you're right.

753
00:50:41,357 --> 00:50:45,919
<i>MAN: We hope you're enjoying
the White House Easter Egg Roll.</i>

754
00:50:45,995 --> 00:50:50,091
<i>Face painting continues at 2:00
near the south fountain.</i>

755
00:50:51,567 --> 00:50:55,128
- BEN: That Connor in the bunny suit?
- Thank you.

756
00:50:55,204 --> 00:50:58,332
I've never been to an Easter Egg Roll.
It's kind of sweet.

757
00:50:58,441 --> 00:51:00,068
Yeah, I love it.

758
00:51:01,611 --> 00:51:05,809
I know you. Your great-great-grandfather
killed President Lincoln.

759
00:51:05,882 --> 00:51:08,248
No. That would be John Wilkes Booth.

760
00:51:08,317 --> 00:51:10,478
Eisenschiml says that Booth was a tool

761
00:51:10,553 --> 00:51:13,989
in a greater conspiracy
that involved men in Lincoln's Cabinet.

762
00:51:14,056 --> 00:51:16,422
Absurd.
Eisenschiml's book is filled with

763
00:51:16,492 --> 00:51:19,461
- spotty research and false assumptions.
- Oh, yeah?

764
00:51:19,529 --> 00:51:22,657
Explain why Lincoln's bodyguard
left his post that night?

765
00:51:22,732 --> 00:51:26,133
Because President Lincoln
was never accompanied by guards

766
00:51:26,202 --> 00:51:29,729
when attending the theater. Listening?
Especially on Good Friday.

767
00:51:29,805 --> 00:51:32,774
Explain why all the bridges
out of Washington were closed

768
00:51:32,842 --> 00:51:36,005
except one,
the one Booth needed to escape?

769
00:51:36,078 --> 00:51:39,047
OK, run along now,
you impossible child. Run along.

770
00:51:40,683 --> 00:51:43,243
What is going on
with the education in America?

771
00:51:43,319 --> 00:51:46,288
- Hey! Hey!
- Connor!

772
00:51:46,355 --> 00:51:48,823
- I'm so glad you decided to come...
- Hey.

773
00:51:48,891 --> 00:51:51,451
...with Gates.
- Connor.

774
00:51:51,527 --> 00:51:53,586
- We just ran into each other.
- Oh.

775
00:51:57,567 --> 00:51:59,159
Aren't you going to ask him?

776
00:51:59,235 --> 00:52:00,725
- Ask me what?
- Nothing.

777
00:52:00,803 --> 00:52:03,931
- No, really. What?
- I really wouldn't want to impose.

778
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:09,139
Well, what she means is
she doesn't think you can.

779
00:52:09,211 --> 00:52:12,339
- Doesn't think I can what?
- She wants to see the Oval Office.

780
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:16,283
- No. That is way too much to ask.
- No, it's, uh...

781
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:19,482
- I can do that.
- Really?

782
00:52:19,555 --> 00:52:20,544
You see?

783
00:52:21,190 --> 00:52:22,521
- You can?
- Yeah.

784
00:52:22,592 --> 00:52:26,892
That is so cool, Connor. I have
always wanted to see the Oval Office.

785
00:52:26,963 --> 00:52:28,624
Connor rocks.

786
00:52:29,298 --> 00:52:32,324
Well... here we are.

787
00:52:32,401 --> 00:52:34,767
- Mm.
- Wow.

788
00:52:35,204 --> 00:52:39,470
Empire furnishings
and crenelated molding. Love it.

789
00:52:39,542 --> 00:52:41,373
Hm.

790
00:52:41,444 --> 00:52:44,345
Amazing feeling, isn't it,
standing in here?

791
00:52:44,413 --> 00:52:47,405
- Yes. Amazing, huh?
- Oh, could...

792
00:52:47,483 --> 00:52:48,609
Oh. Sorry.

793
00:52:51,253 --> 00:52:54,882
Oh, that's, uh... The Resolute desk.

794
00:52:55,558 --> 00:52:58,618
Might recognize it from
the photo of young JFK Junior

795
00:52:58,728 --> 00:53:01,288
playing underneath
while his father was working.

796
00:53:01,330 --> 00:53:03,230
- Wonderful.
- Yeah.

797
00:53:03,299 --> 00:53:06,200
But many people don't know

798
00:53:06,268 --> 00:53:09,726
that this desk has a twin
that sits in Buckingham Palace.

799
00:53:09,805 --> 00:53:11,830
- Isn't that something?
- Who knew?

800
00:53:11,907 --> 00:53:14,171
Every president since
Rutherford B. Hayes

801
00:53:14,243 --> 00:53:17,178
has used that desk,
except, uh, Johnson and Nixon.

802
00:53:17,246 --> 00:53:18,713
And Ford, of course.

803
00:53:18,848 --> 00:53:21,282
- Uh, no.
- Uh, yes.

804
00:53:21,350 --> 00:53:23,375
- No.
- Yes.

805
00:53:23,452 --> 00:53:26,182
Abigail! Did you lose an earring?

806
00:53:27,056 --> 00:53:29,889
Oh! I... I did, yes.

807
00:53:29,959 --> 00:53:33,224
Connor, these were given to me
by my grandmother.

808
00:53:33,295 --> 00:53:37,095
I suppose we should look for it.
Wouldn't want anyone finding an earring

809
00:53:37,166 --> 00:53:40,101
that doesn't belong
to the first lady in the Oval Office.

810
00:53:40,169 --> 00:53:41,534
- Yes.
- Excellent point,

811
00:53:41,604 --> 00:53:43,902
considering we're not
supposed to be here.

812
00:53:43,973 --> 00:53:47,204
- Yeah.
- Why don't we, um, go over here

813
00:53:47,276 --> 00:53:48,607
and check it out?

814
00:53:50,379 --> 00:53:52,313
I'll check over here.

815
00:54:01,290 --> 00:54:03,850
- Do you think it fell down here?
- Yes.

816
00:54:10,466 --> 00:54:13,902
- Maybe here.
- Probably.

817
00:54:21,977 --> 00:54:23,638
Oh, no.

818
00:54:28,984 --> 00:54:32,818
- You did sit on the sofa.
- Oh, the bunnies.

819
00:54:38,194 --> 00:54:39,855
Connor!

820
00:54:39,929 --> 00:54:44,093
- You found it.
- I did.

821
00:54:54,009 --> 00:54:56,000
Thank you so much!

822
00:54:56,445 --> 00:54:57,912
Uh...

823
00:54:58,748 --> 00:55:01,546
You're just the best. Mm.

824
00:55:05,588 --> 00:55:06,680
Mm!

825
00:55:12,261 --> 00:55:13,592
Mm!

826
00:55:14,396 --> 00:55:15,658
Mm!

827
00:55:16,932 --> 00:55:19,230
- (CLEARS THROAT)
- (MOANING)

828
00:55:20,336 --> 00:55:21,496
(PANTING) Thank you.

829
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:24,907
OK.

830
00:55:24,907 --> 00:55:25,737
OK.

831
00:55:28,310 --> 00:55:30,574
- BEN: Empty.
- ABIGAIL: Someone must've taken it.

832
00:55:30,646 --> 00:55:34,241
Brightest men in our country sat
at that desk for over a hundred years.

833
00:55:34,316 --> 00:55:36,443
- Look.
- Course one of 'em found the map.

834
00:55:36,519 --> 00:55:40,011
- A symbol stamped into the wood.
- The presidential seal.

835
00:55:40,089 --> 00:55:41,989
It's not the presidential seal.

836
00:55:42,057 --> 00:55:45,720
The eagle's holding a scroll
instead of olive branches.

837
00:55:45,795 --> 00:55:48,696
- BEN: I'm not sure what this is.
- PATRICK: What do we do?

838
00:55:48,764 --> 00:55:50,356
Did none of you read my book?

839
00:55:52,268 --> 00:55:54,532
The eagle clutching the scroll.

840
00:55:54,904 --> 00:55:56,701
- Do you know what it means?
- Yeah.

841
00:55:56,772 --> 00:55:58,899
But it's not something I could tell you.

842
00:55:59,975 --> 00:56:03,911
It's something that
I have to show you... in my book.

843
00:56:10,219 --> 00:56:13,916
- You didn't even open it?
- I was moving.

844
00:56:13,989 --> 00:56:15,547
Chapter 13.

845
00:56:20,362 --> 00:56:24,628
- "The President's Secret Book"?
- "The President's Secret Book."

846
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:28,864
It happens to be a collection
of documents for presidents

847
00:56:28,938 --> 00:56:32,339
by presidents,
and for presidents' eyes only.

848
00:56:32,741 --> 00:56:36,142
And I'm not just talking about
JFK here, guys.

849
00:56:36,212 --> 00:56:40,649
The 18 and a half missing minutes
of the Watergate tapes.

850
00:56:41,350 --> 00:56:45,446
Did the Apollo really land
on the moon? Did it? Did it?

851
00:56:45,521 --> 00:56:49,480
And the coup de grâce... Area 51.

852
00:56:49,558 --> 00:56:52,686
Come on, Riley. That's...
that's an urban legend.

853
00:56:52,761 --> 00:56:55,696
Is it, Abigail? Is it?

854
00:56:56,732 --> 00:56:57,926
It's just totally...

855
00:56:58,033 --> 00:56:59,261
- Crazy?
- Yeah.

856
00:56:59,301 --> 00:57:04,102
Hm. 'Cause last time I checked,
we pretty much make our living on crazy.

857
00:57:04,173 --> 00:57:07,336
- He's got a point.
- I guess so.

858
00:57:08,944 --> 00:57:09,968
Same symbol.

859
00:57:10,045 --> 00:57:13,446
Released in '66 under
the Freedom of Information Act.

860
00:57:13,515 --> 00:57:15,244
The eagle and the scroll,

861
00:57:15,317 --> 00:57:19,583
the secret symbol
in the President's Book.

862
00:57:19,655 --> 00:57:22,453
So you're saying that
whatever was on that plank

863
00:57:22,524 --> 00:57:25,425
is now in the President's Secret Book?

864
00:57:27,730 --> 00:57:29,129
RILEY: Ben.

865
00:57:29,798 --> 00:57:31,891
If it was you trying to convince me...

866
00:57:32,801 --> 00:57:36,396
...you'd have less evidence,
and I'd already believe you by now.

867
00:57:41,110 --> 00:57:42,839
The eagle with the scroll?

868
00:57:45,214 --> 00:57:47,614
Conspiracy theorists like to believe

869
00:57:47,683 --> 00:57:50,550
that it's the symbol
for the President's Secret Book.

870
00:57:50,619 --> 00:57:52,211
You bought Riley's book.

871
00:57:52,288 --> 00:57:55,689
(LAUGHS) Your friend writes a book
about government conspiracies.

872
00:57:55,758 --> 00:57:58,226
- You don't think we know about it?
- But is it true?

873
00:57:58,327 --> 00:58:00,727
Does the president have a secret book?

874
00:58:07,636 --> 00:58:08,898
Do you like ducks?

875
00:58:10,372 --> 00:58:11,964
(QUACKING)

876
00:58:12,374 --> 00:58:13,568
There is a book.

877
00:58:15,110 --> 00:58:16,907
Why are you telling me out here?

878
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:20,548
Because inside, I'm a federal agent.

879
00:58:20,616 --> 00:58:22,880
Out here,
I'm talking to you as a friend.

880
00:58:22,952 --> 00:58:27,355
- Where's the President's Book kept?
- Only the current president knows.

881
00:58:27,423 --> 00:58:30,017
The book is passed
from president to president,

882
00:58:30,092 --> 00:58:32,356
and each one chooses
his own hiding place.

883
00:58:32,428 --> 00:58:34,453
You're the FBI.
Can't you get it for me?

884
00:58:34,530 --> 00:58:38,091
Only way you'll ever see that book
is if you get elected president.

885
00:58:39,134 --> 00:58:40,533
Well, you never know.

886
00:58:42,404 --> 00:58:44,634
All I need is a few minutes with him.

887
00:58:45,507 --> 00:58:47,304
A few minutes? Really?

888
00:58:47,376 --> 00:58:49,606
Even if you were married
to the president,

889
00:58:49,678 --> 00:58:51,942
you wouldn't be able
to get a few minutes.

890
00:58:52,014 --> 00:58:55,006
Not when he's surrounded by handlers.
If I get him alone...

891
00:58:55,084 --> 00:58:57,382
How do you expect
to get the president alone?

892
00:58:57,486 --> 00:59:00,580
Before the Civil War,
the states were all separate.

893
00:59:00,923 --> 00:59:04,415
People used to say,
"The United States are."

894
00:59:04,994 --> 00:59:09,795
Wasn't until the war ended people
started saying, "The United States is."

895
00:59:11,633 --> 00:59:16,195
Under Lincoln... we became one nation.

896
00:59:16,271 --> 00:59:18,432
And Lincoln paid for it with his life.

897
00:59:18,507 --> 00:59:20,998
- So did Thomas Gates.
- Right.

898
00:59:22,144 --> 00:59:23,406
With his life.

899
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:28,873
So how am I gonna get him alone?

900
00:59:32,588 --> 00:59:33,850
I'm gonna kidnap him.

901
00:59:35,491 --> 00:59:38,483
I'm gonna kidnap
the president of the United States.

902
00:59:40,462 --> 00:59:42,089
(LAUGHS)

903
00:59:42,164 --> 00:59:44,257
- That's not funny.
- I'm your father.

904
00:59:44,333 --> 00:59:47,564
How do you expect me to respond?
I can't let you ruin your life.

905
00:59:47,636 --> 00:59:49,627
Are you out of your mind?

906
00:59:49,705 --> 00:59:52,765
Read my book, and you'd know
you can't get to that book.

907
00:59:52,841 --> 00:59:55,241
Exactly how do you plan on doing this?

908
00:59:56,578 --> 00:59:58,280
- I was thinking Mount Vernon.
- Oh.

909
00:59:58,280 --> 00:59:59,474
- I was thinking Mount Vernon.
- Oh.

910
00:59:59,548 --> 01:00:01,743
- What?
- I'm in.

911
01:00:01,917 --> 01:00:04,681
MAN: Sir, we have to move the party.

912
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:07,653
Some historian claims
the Spencer Landmark Hotel

913
01:00:07,723 --> 01:00:10,214
was used for Klan meetings
in the late 1800s.

914
01:00:10,292 --> 01:00:13,750
<i>- Anyone know if this is true?
- I've got the Washington Gazette.</i>

915
01:00:13,829 --> 01:00:17,925
They want a quote on, "Is the president
being insensitive to minority issues?"

916
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:21,128
- Doesn't matter.
- Get a list of approved alternates.

917
01:00:21,203 --> 01:00:23,865
- What do you have?
- Yeah, I know it's short notice.

918
01:00:23,939 --> 01:00:27,636
The pipe burst in the hotel
that we previously booked.

919
01:00:27,709 --> 01:00:32,737
- I... There is water everywhere.
- A retirement party for 200 people.

920
01:00:32,815 --> 01:00:35,579
- Gunston Hall.
- Monticello is booked.

921
01:00:35,651 --> 01:00:37,915
So is Gunston Hall and Tudor Place.

922
01:00:37,986 --> 01:00:41,353
The Denby Hotel is available,
and so is Mount Vernon.

923
01:00:41,423 --> 01:00:45,587
- Oh, wow. You are a lifesaver.
- The Denby is great.

924
01:00:45,661 --> 01:00:48,858
Strike that. The Denby was booked.
Mount Vernon's all we got.

925
01:00:48,931 --> 01:00:51,126
Book it before someone else does.

926
01:00:52,668 --> 01:00:55,762
(CHEERING)
(APPLAUSE)

927
01:00:55,838 --> 01:00:58,432
And let me say
what an honor it is to be here

928
01:00:58,540 --> 01:01:00,838
and add my happy birthday to you,
Mr. President.

Yeah, but this is

That may be, but I'm gonna
need to have you move upriver.

Are you aware that according
to article one, section 25

of the Maryland constitution,
I'm allowed to fish in public water?

Are you aware I have the right to detain
you for the next 48 hours without cause?

939

I am going to go back where
I came from just as fast as possible.

I beg your pardon, sir,
but I know what a huge admirer you are

960
01:03:25,020 --> 01:03:29,013
of George Washington. I thought
you might want to take a look at this.

961
01:03:29,091 --> 01:03:30,649
Have a look at that.

962
01:03:30,726 --> 01:03:34,321
This is a map of Mount Vernon
drawn by George Washington himself.

963
01:03:34,396 --> 01:03:37,263
Mr. President,
that is exactly what it is.

964
01:03:37,332 --> 01:03:41,098
- Architectural history major, Yale.
- I did not know that.

965
01:03:41,169 --> 01:03:42,966
It belonged to my great uncle.

966
01:03:43,038 --> 01:03:45,165
Got it from the granddaughter
of a slave, Charlotte.

967
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:48,539
- Happy birthday.
- Always a pleasure. Thank you so much.

- Yeah.
- And we're standing right here, sir.

I wonder if it's still there.

- Well...
- (LAUGHS)

973
01:04:06,928 --> 01:04:10,625
- Only one way to find out, sir.
- Maybe we should take a look.

974
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:12,924
Are we allowed to do that?

975
01:04:13,302 --> 01:04:16,703
I mean, I know you're allowed
to do that. You're the president.

976
01:04:16,772 --> 01:04:18,034
Can I come with you?

1009
01:06:35,777 --> 01:06:38,371
Mr. President, sometime between 1880,

1010
01:06:38,447 --> 01:06:41,541
when the Resolute desk
was placed in the Oval Office,

1011
01:06:41,616 --> 01:06:46,110
and now, one of our presidents found
a secret compartment in the desk.

1012
01:06:46,188 --> 01:06:49,954
Hidden inside was a plank
with Native American writing on it.

1013
01:06:50,025 --> 01:06:54,792
A treasure map to Cíbola,
the legendary City of Gold, sir.

1014
01:06:54,863 --> 01:06:57,195
All this just to ask me
about a treasure map?

1015
01:06:57,299 --> 01:07:00,666
That map is a key to proving
Thomas Gates' innocence.

1016
01:07:00,702 --> 01:07:04,968
I know for a fact that the plank
is no longer in the Resolute desk.

1017
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:06,564
You've been in my desk too?

1018
01:07:06,641 --> 01:07:09,701
I believe the whereabouts
of that plank is now hidden...

1019
01:07:10,545 --> 01:07:12,570
...in the President's Book, sir.

1020
01:07:15,517 --> 01:07:17,576
The book known only to our presidents.

1021
01:07:18,687 --> 01:07:21,178
It contains all of our nation's secrets.

how to get out of here

1032

I don't get you, Gates.

1033
01:07:59,327 --> 01:08:02,091
You do all this,
you're willing to go to prison,

1034
01:08:02,163 --> 01:08:04,461

The way out is just down those stairs.

Everything I am
is because of my ancestors, sir.

1037
01:08:12,574 --> 01:08:15,338
Thomas Gates gave his
last full measure of devotion

1038
01:08:15,410 --> 01:08:18,004
to his country to stop the KGC.

1039
01:08:18,079 --> 01:08:21,879

I believe they should be honored.

1043
01:08:33,728 --> 01:08:36,925
Sir, I know the book exists,
and my question is,

1044
01:08:36,998 --> 01:08:40,365
"Will you agree to let me see it?"

1045
01:08:41,002 --> 01:08:43,698
Even if something like that
really did exist,

1046
01:08:43,772 --> 01:08:46,673
why do you think I would
actually just give it to you?

1047
01:08:47,275 --> 01:08:49,140
Because it will probably lead us

1048
01:08:49,210 --> 01:08:53,306
to the discovery of the greatest
Native American treasure of all time.

1049

You can give that history
back to its descendants.

And because you're the president
of the United States, sir.

1052

Whether by innate character, or the oath
you took to defend the Constitution,

1053

or the weight of history
that falls upon you.

to be an honorable man, sir.

Yes. "Islands...
Islands of stone in a sea of grass."

1227
01:22:20,089 --> 01:22:24,719
That's what the Lakota used to call
the Black Hills in South Dakota.

1228
01:22:25,428 --> 01:22:26,417
Right.

1229

"Find where the moon touches the earth
and release the hummingbird."

That's it?

1231
01:22:47,350 --> 01:22:51,684
Did it ever occur to you?
I can't believe I'm saying this.

1232
01:22:52,888 --> 01:22:56,824
Did it ever occur to you that I did
the things I did to impress you?

1233
01:22:59,595 --> 01:23:03,463
No, you did it because you wanted to,
and I would've done the same thing,

1234
01:23:03,532 --> 01:23:06,865
except one of us had to grow up
and stay home and look after Ben.

Certainly wasn't going to be you.

1236

Did it ever occur to you that I made
sacrifices for us that you never did?

1237

No, of course not.

1238
01:23:18,914 --> 01:23:20,745
So just go away.

Don't feel bad. You did good.

Patrick believed every word you said.

1242
01:23:45,341 --> 01:23:48,902
Besides, your son would have
never found the treasure anyway.

1243
01:23:48,978 --> 01:23:50,809
You don't know Benjamin.

1244
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:54,441
Perhaps not.
But then again, I have this.

1245
01:23:58,087 --> 01:24:02,956
A letter from Queen Victoria to
the Confederate General Albert Pike?

1246
01:24:03,025 --> 01:24:07,291
Seems the dear old queen
was partial to the Confederate cause.

1247
01:24:07,997 --> 01:24:10,932
This has been handed down
by my family for 140 years.

1248
01:24:11,767 --> 01:24:16,067
Contains a vital piece of information.
The final clue, as it were.

1249
01:24:16,138 --> 01:24:22,008
This piece of information is worthless
without your translation of the planks.

1250
01:24:23,512 --> 01:24:25,275
It's ironic, isn't it?

1251
01:24:25,347 --> 01:24:30,114
This all began with the burning
of pages, and now it ends

1252
01:24:30,186 --> 01:24:33,713
with the burning of this,
the final clue.

1253
01:24:34,557 --> 01:24:36,286

Get your coat.

1257
01:24:55,211 --> 01:24:58,203
Her translation on the second half
of the planks says

1258
01:24:58,280 --> 01:25:01,841
- we need to find an island of stone.
- Ben would have found it by now.

1259
01:25:02,251 --> 01:25:03,513

- Wait for me.
- No way. You're too slow.

1265
01:25:22,271 --> 01:25:25,263
I knew you'd figure out
the message I gave your father.

1266
01:25:25,674 --> 01:25:28,643
The hummingbird was good. Let her go.

1267
01:25:28,711 --> 01:25:32,442
We're the ones with the firepower,
and you're giving me orders.

1268
01:25:32,515 --> 01:25:36,781
I kidnapped the president. The FBI
is on their way right now to arrest me,

1269
01:25:36,852 --> 01:25:38,877
and I'm sure they'll love to meet you.

1270
01:25:38,954 --> 01:25:41,081
They'll find us both and arrest us both.

1271
01:25:41,157 --> 01:25:43,887
That path doesn't lead
to the City of Gold, does it?

1272
01:25:44,126 --> 01:25:47,027
This man has information you need.
He's got a letter.

1273
01:25:47,096 --> 01:25:49,462
From Queen Victoria
to General Albert Pike.

1274
01:25:49,532 --> 01:25:52,399
- How do you know that?
- I read about it, in a book.

1275
01:25:55,471 --> 01:25:56,938
I'm afraid he's burned it.

1276
01:26:00,242 --> 01:26:04,941
All right... You've had me do
all the work so far, why stop now?

1277
01:26:05,581 --> 01:26:08,914
You tell me what you know,
I'll find the City of Gold,

1278
01:26:08,984 --> 01:26:12,215
prove Thomas Gates' innocence,
you can have the treasure.

1279
01:26:12,288 --> 01:26:14,188
- What?
- I'm going with you.

1280
01:26:14,256 --> 01:26:18,022
But if anyone's gonna be credited
for discovering the City of Gold,

1281
01:26:18,093 --> 01:26:19,355
it's going to be me.

1282
01:26:19,428 --> 01:26:22,522
But your partners stay here,
and all the guns.

1283
01:26:22,598 --> 01:26:24,259
What makes you think I'd agree?

1284
01:26:25,167 --> 01:26:29,695
Because you need that treasure.
Believe me, I know.

1285
01:26:34,276 --> 01:26:36,506
All right, Gates. We'll do it your way.

1286
01:26:39,415 --> 01:26:43,283
But believe me... I don't need the guns.

1287
01:26:48,224 --> 01:26:52,024
- Which president? The president?
- I thought it best not to tell you.

1288

ABIGAIL: I still don't see anything
that looks like a noble bird.

1289
01:27:10,946 --> 01:27:12,914
All right. Let's have it.

1290
01:27:12,982 --> 01:27:17,419
What did the letter say? What's
the clue from Queen Victoria's letter?

1291
01:27:17,486 --> 01:27:22,788
"The entrance shall only be revealed
under a cloudless rain."

1292
01:27:22,858 --> 01:27:24,450
Figure that one out.

1293
01:27:24,526 --> 01:27:28,155
So we come back when it's raining?

1294
01:27:30,165 --> 01:27:33,999
"Cloudless." Could simply mean the sun.

1295
01:27:34,670 --> 01:27:37,662
You need a sunny day... and rain.

1296
01:27:39,041 --> 01:27:40,030
We need water.

1297
01:27:40,776 --> 01:27:41,936
Water.

Everybody, the water makes
the rocks darker. Use the water.

- Good, good, good.

1302
01:28:15,844 --> 01:28:19,075
This is ridiculous.
Are we going to water the whole thing?

1303
01:28:28,724 --> 01:28:30,191
That's it.

1304
01:28:30,259 --> 01:28:34,855
Oh! That's it. I found it.
Over here! Found it! Over here!

1305
01:28:37,066 --> 01:28:38,192
Look at this!

1306
01:28:39,735 --> 01:28:40,793
It's an eagle.

1307
01:28:42,771 --> 01:28:45,399
- Look at that. It's an eagle.
- There it is.

1308
01:28:45,841 --> 01:28:48,639
- "The noble bird..."
- "Will give you passage."

1309
01:28:48,711 --> 01:28:52,203
- Uh-huh. Now what?
- We need to join hands,

1310
01:28:52,314 --> 01:28:57,183
and in a noble manner,
pass over the bird.

1311
01:28:58,320 --> 01:29:01,847
- PATRICK: It indicates direction...
- RILEY: Somehow that bird...

1312
01:29:01,924 --> 01:29:05,758
...will rise from the rock
and kind of caw...

1313
01:29:05,828 --> 01:29:10,060
You can stand around guessing for a
while, or I can give you the next clue.

"Surrender your hand
to the heart of the warrior."

1315
01:29:15,771 --> 01:29:18,103
And the eagle
is a symbol of the warrior.

1316
01:29:23,512 --> 01:29:25,707
Ben, no. Wait, wait! No.

1317
01:29:25,781 --> 01:29:28,477
That's probably a horrible trap.
Tell him!

1318
01:29:28,550 --> 01:29:30,108
It's a horrible trap.

1319
01:29:30,185 --> 01:29:33,814
It would be a pity to come this far
and not even try, now, wouldn't it?

1320
01:29:35,157 --> 01:29:36,522
I'll do it, Ben.

1321
01:29:37,159 --> 01:29:38,148
It's OK.

1322
01:29:42,698 --> 01:29:44,563
Surrender your hand.

- I am sorry. I... I couldn't resist.
- You!

Oh, that's beautiful!

- No.

01:31:40,816 --> 01:31:41,805
Get up.

1343
01:31:43,652 --> 01:31:44,641
It's locked.

1344
01:31:44,720 --> 01:31:49,487
- Patrick, what have you done?
- Some kind of a bolt. I didn't do it.

1345
01:31:49,558 --> 01:31:51,526
Only one way out of here now.

So beautifully preserved.

to be moving some rocks.

- What you want me to do?
- Stop! Stop!

1362
01:33:20,415 --> 01:33:24,112
We have to balance our weight
to even this thing out.

- We'll find 'em.
- What are we gonna do?

- Toss me the light.

1498
01:47:55,790 --> 01:47:58,816
No, if it's open,
this tunnel will stay flooded.

1499
01:47:58,893 --> 01:48:01,589
We've got to get to the other side
and close the door.

1500
01:48:01,662 --> 01:48:03,391
Patrick, Emily, go!

1501
01:48:08,769 --> 01:48:09,827
- No.
- No!

1502
01:48:11,405 --> 01:48:12,394
No!

1503
01:48:12,473 --> 01:48:15,237
Mitch, we got to be
on the other side of that door!

1504
01:48:15,776 --> 01:48:17,573
Nobody leaves unless I say so.

1505
01:48:19,046 --> 01:48:21,640
That door is not gonna stay open
by itself.

1506
01:48:21,716 --> 01:48:23,946
We both know what has to happen here.

1507
01:48:24,452 --> 01:48:27,853
One of us keeps the door open
and stays behind.

1508
01:48:29,824 --> 01:48:30,916
I vote Mitch.

1509
01:48:31,993 --> 01:48:33,927
This isn't a democracy.

1510
01:48:33,995 --> 01:48:36,486
(GRUNTING)
(SHOUTING)

1511
01:48:38,566 --> 01:48:42,525
Stop! I'll stay!
I'm staying. Look. Look!

1512
01:48:43,471 --> 01:48:45,962
See? I'm right here! I'm staying!

1513
01:48:46,040 --> 01:48:48,770
I'll tell everybody
how this is going to go.

1514
01:48:48,843 --> 01:48:53,109
You and me are going to open that door.
Anybody tries to leave before me,

1515
01:48:53,214 --> 01:48:55,614
I drop the door,
we start this all over again!

1516
01:48:55,650 --> 01:48:59,552
Try any funny business, I guarantee you
people are going to get hurt!

1517
01:49:01,455 --> 01:49:04,947
I won't! You have my word.
Just let her go.

1518
01:49:08,996 --> 01:49:11,624
Ben, no, we're not leaving without you.

1519
01:49:13,601 --> 01:49:14,590
BEN: Abigail.

1520
01:49:18,706 --> 01:49:22,437
You make my parents leave.
You make my parents leave.

1521
01:49:31,786 --> 01:49:33,048
- No!
- Let's go!

1522
01:49:33,554 --> 01:49:37,513
Let's go, please! Patrick, Emily,
he's trying to save our lives.

1523
01:49:38,259 --> 01:49:39,886
Please, come on.

1524
01:49:41,862 --> 01:49:43,056
Push, Ben!

1525
01:49:46,734 --> 01:49:48,668
The current's too strong!

1526
01:49:51,906 --> 01:49:54,101
- I'm ready!
- It's all yours!

1527
01:50:10,091 --> 01:50:11,080
Ah!

1528
01:50:17,164 --> 01:50:18,324
Mom!

1529
01:50:18,899 --> 01:50:21,129
- (STRAINING)
- Hang on!

1530
01:50:23,971 --> 01:50:25,233
Hold your breath!

1531
01:50:35,016 --> 01:50:36,847
Ah!

1532
01:50:36,917 --> 01:50:38,646
We got to get Ben out of there!

1533
01:50:41,689 --> 01:50:45,989
If I'm stuck in the door,
it stays open,

1534
01:50:46,060 --> 01:50:48,995
both rooms fill up, and we all drown!

1535
01:50:49,063 --> 01:50:53,193
- Open the door! I'll get you out!
- The current's too strong!

1536
01:50:53,301 --> 01:50:55,826
I open the door,
you'll be washed down!

1537
01:50:55,870 --> 01:50:57,235
I'll get you out!

1538
01:50:57,305 --> 01:51:01,674
I found the City of Gold! I found it!

1539
01:51:01,742 --> 01:51:03,733
And no one will ever know?

1540
01:51:03,811 --> 01:51:08,043
We can figure this out!
We can all get out!

1541
01:51:08,115 --> 01:51:11,676
It's not a puzzle!
No more puzzles, Ben!

1542
01:51:11,752 --> 01:51:14,915
We're all going to die,
or it could just be me!

1543
01:51:15,756 --> 01:51:19,214
- Tell them I found it!
- Don't quit!

1544
01:51:20,728 --> 01:51:22,855
- (STRAINING)
- Mitch!

1545
01:51:32,006 --> 01:51:33,064
Ah!

1546
01:52:03,337 --> 01:52:04,463
Thank you.

1547
01:52:21,989 --> 01:52:25,948
- We haven't officially met. I'm Riley.
- EMILY: Oh, hi.

1548
01:52:32,199 --> 01:52:34,759
Sir! It's for you.

1549
01:52:36,070 --> 01:52:37,059
Sadusky.

1550
01:52:38,005 --> 01:52:40,803
- I have my proof.
- Ben!

1551
01:52:41,208 --> 01:52:45,076
We were just talking about you.
Ready to turn yourself in?

1552
01:52:45,146 --> 01:52:48,809
Not quite.
We found the City of Gold.

1553
01:52:48,883 --> 01:52:51,681
Doesn't matter.
You still committed a federal crime.

1554
01:53:12,173 --> 01:53:14,767
Stop. Stop it.

1555
01:53:15,876 --> 01:53:18,208
- Mr. President?
- Craig, give us a minute.

1556
01:53:18,279 --> 01:53:22,045
Sir, for your information,
this is the man who kidnapped you.

1557
01:53:22,116 --> 01:53:24,880
As I recall, we were
exploring a hidden tunnel,

1558
01:53:24,952 --> 01:53:28,513
and a door closed accidentally,
and this man saved my life.

1559
01:53:28,856 --> 01:53:30,050
Yes, sir.

1560
01:53:32,259 --> 01:53:34,022
- Gates.
- Sir.

1561
01:53:35,095 --> 01:53:39,657
For the record, after centuries
of exploration, on this day,

1562
01:53:39,733 --> 01:53:43,260
you have brought honor
to your country and your family.

1563
01:53:44,805 --> 01:53:47,740
You've done this country
a great service. I thank you.

1564
01:53:48,275 --> 01:53:50,937
- Thank you.
- Craig.

1565
01:53:52,279 --> 01:53:56,545
I thought you might want to
take a look at tomorrow's headlines.

1566
01:53:58,118 --> 01:53:59,107
Tomorrow?

1567
01:54:07,328 --> 01:54:08,590
Thank you, sir.

1568
01:54:09,563 --> 01:54:12,031
All of you, along with
Emily and Patrick Gates

1569
01:54:12,099 --> 01:54:14,192
will get credit for this discovery.

1570
01:54:21,342 --> 01:54:23,708
And Mitch Wilkinson, sir.

1571
01:54:24,612 --> 01:54:28,446
- Is that right?
- It's true, sir.

1572
01:54:30,050 --> 01:54:33,042
Ben, I am curious
about that favor I asked you.

1573
01:54:34,588 --> 01:54:37,022
Any report regarding
what's on page 47?

1574
01:54:37,091 --> 01:54:39,286
I believe I can help with that, sir.

1575
01:54:39,360 --> 01:54:42,557
- So it's good.
- Life-altering, sir.

1576
01:54:46,233 --> 01:54:49,862
What's on page 47?
Are you talking about the Book?

1577
01:54:53,107 --> 01:54:54,233
What book?

1578
01:54:55,809 --> 01:54:59,870
EMILY: Be very careful with that.
Is that distilled water you're using?

1579
01:54:59,947 --> 01:55:02,211
- Yes.
- Have you catalogued all of this?

1580
01:55:02,283 --> 01:55:03,648
- No, ma'am.
- You haven't?

1581
01:55:03,717 --> 01:55:06,777
Excuse me? Excuse me, sir?
Are you cataloguing this?

1582
01:55:06,854 --> 01:55:10,153
You should've been there
when we picked out our first couch.

1583
01:55:14,128 --> 01:55:15,561
Excuse me.

1584
01:55:15,629 --> 01:55:19,531
Hey, you're that guy...
The treasure hunter guy, right?

1585
01:55:19,600 --> 01:55:23,434
No, actually, the guy you're thinking of
is somewhere over there.

1586
01:55:23,504 --> 01:55:27,941
No. You're him. Riley Poole.
I recognize you from your book.

1587
01:55:28,609 --> 01:55:30,600
- Will you sign it?
- (CRASHING)

1588
01:55:30,678 --> 01:55:31,667
OK.

1589
01:55:40,921 --> 01:55:41,910
Thank you.

1590
01:55:43,257 --> 01:55:46,488
So, um, the tea tables...

1591
01:55:47,494 --> 01:55:51,225
Yes, I'm going to have the movers
bring them to you next week.

1592
01:55:52,199 --> 01:55:54,133
I was going to say
you can keep them.

1593
01:55:55,002 --> 01:55:59,132
And maybe you could...

1594
01:55:59,206 --> 01:56:01,504
...come and move back in with me.

1595
01:56:02,676 --> 01:56:05,474
- No. You used the word "so."
- So?

1596
01:56:05,546 --> 01:56:07,980
So, when you say "so,"
it means you're angry.

1597
01:56:08,048 --> 01:56:12,007
Sometimes.
And then sometimes it doesn't.

1598
01:56:12,086 --> 01:56:14,418
It's sort of like a puzzle.

1599
01:56:15,956 --> 01:56:19,619
And you're so good at puzzles.
I'm sure you'll figure it out.

1600
01:56:22,162 --> 01:56:23,356
So...

1601
01:57:04,071 --> 01:57:05,629

1603
01:57:10,144 --> 01:57:11,771
I love this car.
