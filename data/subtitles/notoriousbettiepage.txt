1
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,628
Do you have anything
a little different?

2
00:01:37,669 --> 00:01:40,502
I'm not sure
I get your drift.

3
00:01:40,539 --> 00:01:43,997
Do you have anything
with unusual footwear?

4
00:01:46,444 --> 00:01:49,004
High heels?
Boots?

5
00:01:49,047 --> 00:01:51,777
Leather boots...
with laces?

6
00:01:57,889 --> 00:02:00,756
Very good, yes.
I'll take that.

7
00:02:00,793 --> 00:02:03,887
Um, do you have
any other material

8
00:02:03,929 --> 00:02:07,262
that shows...
restraint?

9
00:02:15,307 --> 00:02:19,107
It's a big favorite
among certain customers.

10
00:02:19,144 --> 00:02:21,237
The model
is very popular.

11
00:02:24,717 --> 00:02:27,242
Do you have any
more pictures like this?

12
00:02:27,286 --> 00:02:29,618
I'll have to check
the stockroom.

13
00:02:31,524 --> 00:02:33,890
Sir, I'm Detective Farrell
of the New York Police Department.

14
00:02:33,926 --> 00:02:36,918
We have to ask you a few questions about
the material for sale in your shop.

15
00:02:36,962 --> 00:02:39,226
We have reason to believe
you are selling obscene

16
00:02:39,265 --> 00:02:41,256
and indecent literature
on these premises.

17
00:02:47,773 --> 00:02:51,436
Any witness who feels
that he or she may be

18
00:02:51,478 --> 00:02:54,777
embarrassed by the lights
or by the TV and movie cameras...

19
00:02:54,815 --> 00:02:57,477
they will not be asked
to testify for television.

20
00:02:57,516 --> 00:02:59,575
Because of the rules
of the building,

21
00:02:59,619 --> 00:03:01,814
we cannot have smoking
in the courtroom.

22
00:03:01,855 --> 00:03:04,756
That is difficult for some,
I realize...

23
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:06,759
including the chairman.

24
00:03:06,793 --> 00:03:09,819
Since assuming the chairmanship
of the Senate Subcommittee

25
00:03:09,863 --> 00:03:11,854
to Investigate
Juvenile Delinquency,

26
00:03:11,898 --> 00:03:14,696
I have become
increasingly concerned

27
00:03:14,734 --> 00:03:16,861
during each passing week

28
00:03:16,903 --> 00:03:19,337
with the effect
pornographic material has

29
00:03:19,372 --> 00:03:22,808
on American adolescents
and juveniles,

30
00:03:22,843 --> 00:03:25,073
and with the widespread
distribution

31
00:03:25,112 --> 00:03:28,013
of this insidious filth.

32
00:03:28,048 --> 00:03:31,540
Father Egan, you think
this pornographic literature

33
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:34,384
is having a substantial
and degrading effect?

34
00:03:34,421 --> 00:03:37,413
I certainly do.
It is corrupting.

35
00:03:37,457 --> 00:03:41,154
It is rotting at the very
roots of our nation.

36
00:03:41,195 --> 00:03:43,186
Communism will never
defeat America.

37
00:03:43,231 --> 00:03:46,394
No, it's something
from within...

38
00:03:46,433 --> 00:03:49,834
within the nation
that will rot and corrupt it.

39
00:04:18,866 --> 00:04:22,267
Dear Bettie, how are things
in New York City?

40
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:24,294
We haven't heard
from you in a while.

41
00:04:24,338 --> 00:04:27,865
I guess you must be real busy
with your modeling career.

42
00:04:27,909 --> 00:04:31,401
Here's a picture of you
and me at Christmas after church.

43
00:04:31,446 --> 00:04:33,414
It was nice
being together again.

44
00:04:33,448 --> 00:04:35,939
Hope you visit soon.

45
00:04:35,983 --> 00:04:39,510
All my love, Goldie.

46
00:04:39,555 --> 00:04:43,355
"And they went forth
and preached everywhere.

47
00:04:43,392 --> 00:04:47,829
The Lord working with them,
confirming the word

48
00:04:47,862 --> 00:04:51,423
with signs."
Amen.

49
00:04:51,466 --> 00:04:53,730
I know, friends,
that one of these days,

50
00:04:53,769 --> 00:04:55,737
God's gonna call me home.

51
00:04:55,771 --> 00:04:59,366
When he calls, I know it's gonna be...
praise God...

52
00:04:59,408 --> 00:05:01,501
to my eternal home.

53
00:05:01,543 --> 00:05:05,001
But before he calls,
he's gonna give you the chance

54
00:05:05,047 --> 00:05:06,878
to come to him.
Yes, friends,

55
00:05:06,915 --> 00:05:09,315
don't you know the Lord...

56
00:05:09,352 --> 00:05:12,617
gives every sinner man
and every sinner woman

57
00:05:12,654 --> 00:05:15,384
the chance to come
to him, seek him out?

58
00:05:15,424 --> 00:05:19,417
I feel like singing an invitational
hymn now. Brother John?

59
00:05:19,462 --> 00:05:22,522
If there be any unsaved
souls here tonight

60
00:05:22,565 --> 00:05:26,899
Who feel like giving their hearts
to Christ, come seek him out.

61
00:06:21,492 --> 00:06:24,256
Okay.

62
00:06:30,067 --> 00:06:32,297
Y'all, Mrs. Craddock
is looking.

63
00:06:32,336 --> 00:06:34,804
- Let her get an eyeful.
- Who cares?

64
00:06:37,508 --> 00:06:39,442
Do we look
like Ziegfeld girls?

65
00:06:39,476 --> 00:06:41,273
Girls, get on back
in the house!

66
00:06:41,312 --> 00:06:45,146
- Come on and do your chores.
- Come on, let's go inside.

67
00:06:53,624 --> 00:06:57,219
Bettie, I wanna see you.

68
00:06:57,261 --> 00:06:59,889
Come on up.

69
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:16,176
Oh! Oh, why thank you.

70
00:07:19,351 --> 00:07:21,012
Uh, ma'am,

71
00:07:21,052 --> 00:07:23,919
Are you gonna be all right
waiting here like this on your own?

72
00:07:23,955 --> 00:07:25,980
Do you have
a boyfriend or a husband

73
00:07:26,024 --> 00:07:28,015
or something
to keep you company while you wait?

74
00:07:28,058 --> 00:07:31,027
Well, thank you
for your concern, Officer,

75
00:07:31,062 --> 00:07:34,054
But... no, I'm not married.

76
00:07:36,968 --> 00:07:38,936
I'll be fine on my own.

77
00:07:48,681 --> 00:07:52,447
"...The fundamental principles
of democracy is the people's right

78
00:07:52,484 --> 00:07:55,544
- to be represented..."
- That's a pretty girl.

79
00:07:55,587 --> 00:07:57,680
You wait here.
I'm gonna go ask her for a date.

80
00:07:57,722 --> 00:08:01,123
Billy, you fool, that's Bettie Page.
Every guy in town wants

81
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,890
to date that girl,
but her mother won't allow it.

82
00:08:07,265 --> 00:08:09,290
I'd sure like to meet you,
but if I can't,

83
00:08:09,335 --> 00:08:11,030
I'd like to meet
one of your sisters.

84
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:14,062
Well, you can.
They're prettier than me.

85
00:08:14,106 --> 00:08:17,405
That's hard to believe.
May I sit down?

86
00:08:17,442 --> 00:08:19,433
Well...

87
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,714
Hey!

88
00:08:23,749 --> 00:08:25,944
"One of the fundamental
principles of democracy

89
00:08:25,985 --> 00:08:29,148
is the people's right..."

90
00:08:29,189 --> 00:08:31,248
- Did you write that?
- Yes, I did.

91
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:34,782
I'm on the debating team.
Got to memorize it by Friday.

92
00:08:34,827 --> 00:08:37,557
I'd like to debate you
sometime.

93
00:08:37,596 --> 00:08:39,621
You're probably
a lot smarter than me,

94
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:43,466
- but I bet I could put up a good fight.
- That's very interesting.

95
00:08:43,502 --> 00:08:45,470
I was never
much for studying.

96
00:08:45,504 --> 00:08:47,802
They just passed me in school
so I could play ball.

97
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,001
Football?

98
00:08:50,043 --> 00:08:51,908
Yeah, I've seen you play...

99
00:08:51,945 --> 00:08:54,175
- against Hume-Fogg.
- That's right.

100
00:08:54,214 --> 00:08:56,307
You're a good ballplayer.

101
00:08:56,348 --> 00:08:58,578
Yes, I am.
I'm a good dancer too.

102
00:08:58,618 --> 00:09:02,247
- How good are you?
- I know a few steps.

103
00:09:02,289 --> 00:09:05,850
If you come out with me,
I'll show you.

104
00:09:05,892 --> 00:09:07,951
- Well, I'd like to, but...
- Better hurry up.

105
00:09:07,994 --> 00:09:10,588
You're gonna
run out of time.

106
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:13,394
- I signed up.
- You're going overseas?

107
00:09:13,433 --> 00:09:16,027
That's right...
the army.

108
00:09:16,069 --> 00:09:18,299
Well, my mother doesn't
approve of dating.

109
00:09:18,339 --> 00:09:20,307
That's a shame.

110
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,365
That's a darn shame.

111
00:09:22,409 --> 00:09:25,503
You tell your mother
Billy Neal would like to take you out.

112
00:09:26,813 --> 00:09:28,781
Maybe I will.

113
00:09:28,816 --> 00:09:31,148
I'm gonna marry
that girl.

114
00:09:31,185 --> 00:09:34,086
No, you ain't gonna marry her.
Everybody wants that gal.

115
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,179
I don't know.
I'm gonna marry her.

116
00:11:05,647 --> 00:11:07,512
Let's see
if I can get this right.

117
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:09,575
- Oh.
- Whoo.

118
00:11:10,886 --> 00:11:12,979
See you Monday.

119
00:11:31,074 --> 00:11:34,566
I bet it'd look
good on you too.

120
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:37,205
It's a beautiful
night out, isn't it?

121
00:11:37,246 --> 00:11:39,271
Yes, it is.

122
00:11:39,315 --> 00:11:42,512
Say, do you
like dancing?

123
00:11:42,552 --> 00:11:45,578
My buddy and his girl
are going dancing,

124
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:47,613
and they invited me
along and I'm starting

125
00:11:47,657 --> 00:11:51,889
to feel like a third wheel.
I really could use a date.

126
00:11:51,928 --> 00:11:54,556
Well, I do like dancing.

127
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:57,600
Love to dance, in fact.

128
00:11:57,635 --> 00:12:01,435
Well, my... my friends
are just up the block.

129
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:03,268
I'd be thrilled
if you'd come with us.

130
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:06,707
Yeah, I think I will
if you don't mind.

131
00:12:06,743 --> 00:12:09,041
Great.

132
00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:12,139
- My name's Scotty.
- Bettie.

133
00:12:12,182 --> 00:12:14,582
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

134
00:12:14,617 --> 00:12:16,642
Thanks so much.

135
00:12:16,686 --> 00:12:18,881
Have you been
to the Victory Ballroom?

136
00:12:18,922 --> 00:12:20,890
I love to go there
on a Friday night.

137
00:12:20,924 --> 00:12:22,653
The band really cooks.

138
00:12:22,693 --> 00:12:26,493
And I'd just bet you can really dance,
can't you?

139
00:12:26,529 --> 00:12:28,497
Well, I like to dance.

140
00:12:28,532 --> 00:12:30,830
If the music's good,
I like it.

141
00:12:36,173 --> 00:12:38,038
- This is Jake.
- Hi.

142
00:12:38,075 --> 00:12:39,838
- Hi.
- And Ray.

143
00:12:39,877 --> 00:12:42,311
- Hi.
- Pleased to meet you.

144
00:12:45,816 --> 00:12:48,046
The more the merrier.
Ain't that right?

145
00:13:01,866 --> 00:13:04,027
Why are we...

146
00:13:04,068 --> 00:13:06,059
leaving the city?

147
00:13:10,542 --> 00:13:12,533
Where is this place?

148
00:13:18,116 --> 00:13:20,107
Where are we going?

149
00:13:24,889 --> 00:13:26,880
Where are we going?!

150
00:13:52,283 --> 00:13:54,251
Don't try and run.

151
00:13:54,285 --> 00:13:57,186
Oh, please,
for the love of Jesus.

152
00:13:57,223 --> 00:13:58,918
- Please.
- Don't make trouble now.

153
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:01,449
Can't nobody hear you
around here anyway.

154
00:14:01,494 --> 00:14:03,462
You know what we're
here for.

155
00:14:03,496 --> 00:14:05,555
Just get in the back
of the car.

156
00:14:05,597 --> 00:14:08,225
Please, I can't.

157
00:14:08,267 --> 00:14:10,497
Please, it's that time
of the month.

158
00:14:10,536 --> 00:14:11,969
Shit,

159
00:14:12,004 --> 00:14:14,302
I thought you said we were
getting some tail here.

160
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:17,537
Well,

161
00:14:17,576 --> 00:14:20,136
she'll have to give us some kind
of a satisfaction.

162
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:03,278
"Dear Goldie,

163
00:17:03,312 --> 00:17:07,408
I've decided to make a fresh start
in New York City.

164
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:10,442
I've found an apartment
just off Times Square

165
00:17:10,485 --> 00:17:13,454
and painted
and decorated it myself.

166
00:17:13,488 --> 00:17:16,423
I entered a beauty contest
or two.

167
00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:19,758
I won second prize in one,
which was not too bad...

168
00:17:19,796 --> 00:17:21,991
a set of brand new Revere
pots and pans,

169
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:23,998
which I needed very much.

170
00:17:24,032 --> 00:17:27,627
I hope this finds y'all
well and healthy

171
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:30,969
and you kids
are staying out of trouble.

172
00:17:31,007 --> 00:17:34,067
Love to y'all.
Bettie."

173
00:17:50,727 --> 00:17:52,592
- Can I ask you a question?
- Well...

174
00:17:52,628 --> 00:17:56,291
Don't be nervous. I'm a policeman.
Let me show you my badge.

175
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:58,733
See?

176
00:17:59,769 --> 00:18:01,464
I was just curious...

177
00:18:01,504 --> 00:18:04,029
have you ever done
any photographic modeling?

178
00:18:04,073 --> 00:18:06,041
Well, not for photographs.

179
00:18:06,076 --> 00:18:08,977
Well, you look like a model.
I'm a policeman,

180
00:18:09,013 --> 00:18:11,811
but I'm a photographer too...
on weekends, you know?

181
00:18:11,848 --> 00:18:14,339
If you let me take your picture,
I'll give you copies for free.

182
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:17,649
- Take my photo? Right here?
- Sure, why not?

183
00:18:17,688 --> 00:18:19,622
- Looking like this?
- Sure.

184
00:18:19,656 --> 00:18:21,954
I don't know.

185
00:18:21,992 --> 00:18:23,721
You're a southern girl,
aren't you?

186
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,092
Well, I don't wanna
make you feel uncomfortable.

187
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:28,155
Oh, no no,
it's not that.

188
00:18:28,198 --> 00:18:30,689
Don't get me wrong.
I worked with a colored woman,

189
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:33,259
and she was real nice.
It's just...

190
00:18:33,303 --> 00:18:35,328
Well, I...

191
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:40,437
Oh, what's the harm in it?

192
00:18:40,477 --> 00:18:44,208
- Come on, over here.
- Good.

193
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:47,217
I don't think
the kids should see this.

194
00:18:47,252 --> 00:18:49,584
Good, Bettie.
So where're you from in the South?

195
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,554
Nashville, Tennessee.

196
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:54,182
- Ah, home of the Grand Ole Opry.
- You know it?

197
00:18:54,224 --> 00:18:56,215
I hear it on the radio
sometimes.

198
00:18:56,261 --> 00:18:58,195
My wife listens to it
now and then.

199
00:18:58,229 --> 00:19:00,527
Could you lift
your chin up for me, please?

200
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:03,767
A little more.

201
00:19:03,801 --> 00:19:07,760
Good.
Now, uh...

202
00:19:07,806 --> 00:19:11,071
Head up and
to the right.

203
00:19:11,109 --> 00:19:13,907
Great, Bettie.

204
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:15,935
Good.

205
00:19:18,917 --> 00:19:20,908
Hey, Officer.

206
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:27,588
Uh...

207
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,593
well, it seems as if
some of the people here

208
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:32,391
aren't happy about me
taking your picture, Bettie.

209
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:34,455
Well, they're just prejudiced.

210
00:19:34,499 --> 00:19:36,364
I used to be
when I was younger,

211
00:19:36,402 --> 00:19:38,370
but I grew up
and I learned better.

212
00:19:38,403 --> 00:19:41,463
- All we're doing is taking pictures.
- There's kids here.

213
00:19:41,506 --> 00:19:45,101
Maybe next time
we should use my studio.

214
00:19:46,712 --> 00:19:48,703
Let's go.

215
00:20:02,595 --> 00:20:04,358
Good.

216
00:20:04,395 --> 00:20:06,363
Good.

217
00:20:06,398 --> 00:20:09,265
Uh, give me friendly.

218
00:20:09,301 --> 00:20:12,134
Now, give me pert.
Good.

219
00:20:12,171 --> 00:20:14,139
One more.

220
00:20:15,141 --> 00:20:17,166
And give me haughty.

221
00:20:18,177 --> 00:20:20,270
Good, Bettie.
Good.

222
00:20:20,312 --> 00:20:22,109
Now, could you turn
to the side for me, please?

223
00:20:22,148 --> 00:20:24,207
I'd like to see your figure
in profile.

224
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,309
Okay.

225
00:20:26,353 --> 00:20:28,378
All right.
Now, this is a trick

226
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:31,389
that a lot
of photographic models use.

227
00:20:31,423 --> 00:20:33,357
If you put this
in your swimming suit top,

228
00:20:33,392 --> 00:20:35,019
it will enhance your bustline.

229
00:20:38,765 --> 00:20:41,199
This is all lumpy.

230
00:20:41,233 --> 00:20:43,201
Well, you have
to put it underneath.

231
00:20:43,235 --> 00:20:45,135
Oh...

232
00:20:46,139 --> 00:20:47,697
Oh.

233
00:20:50,143 --> 00:20:52,008
Good.
Now give me saucy.

234
00:20:54,347 --> 00:20:56,338
Good, Bettie.

235
00:20:58,618 --> 00:21:00,518
Great, Bettie.
Great!

236
00:21:02,155 --> 00:21:05,215
Yeah, the poses are great.
Now, I have an idea.

237
00:21:05,258 --> 00:21:09,194
Would you mind
if I changed your hairstyle?

238
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:13,831
Come, please.
You have a high, round forehead.

239
00:21:13,867 --> 00:21:17,428
There's nothing wrong with it,
but it catches the light.

240
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:20,837
But if we covered it...

241
00:21:27,715 --> 00:21:30,013
it wouldn't catch the light,

242
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:32,211
and it frames your face.

243
00:21:32,252 --> 00:21:34,220
Yeah, I see what you mean.

244
00:21:34,255 --> 00:21:36,849
- Yeah? Shall we try?
- Sure.

245
00:21:40,528 --> 00:21:44,521
Austin, Green & Dunleavey.
How may I help you?

246
00:21:44,565 --> 00:21:47,090
Yes, sir.
I'll connect you right away.

247
00:21:59,947 --> 00:22:03,075
- Hi, I'm Bettie.
- I'm Art. Step this way.

248
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:07,313
Did Jerry tell you
what the setup is?

249
00:22:07,355 --> 00:22:09,915
You can change in there. The other
girl still has a half hour to go.

250
00:22:09,957 --> 00:22:12,050
That's Maxie.
You can learn from her.

251
00:22:12,093 --> 00:22:14,027
She knows all about
the three essentials...

252
00:22:14,062 --> 00:22:16,394
clothes, pose
and expression.

253
00:22:16,431 --> 00:22:20,265
- "Clothes, pose and expression."
- Over here, over here.

254
00:22:20,301 --> 00:22:22,792
- Maxie, this way.
- And look over here.

255
00:22:22,837 --> 00:22:25,431
- Over here.
- Down here to the right.

256
00:22:25,474 --> 00:22:28,910
- You'll get your turn.
- Maxie, we're dying over here.

257
00:22:28,944 --> 00:22:30,411
Don't forget us boys
in the corner.

258
00:22:30,445 --> 00:22:32,276
- Oh.
- Very good, Maxie.

259
00:22:32,313 --> 00:22:33,871
Can you bend over
on one leg?

260
00:22:35,117 --> 00:22:36,709
- No, like this.
- Hey!

261
00:22:36,752 --> 00:22:39,346
Hey, no touching!
Do it again and you're out on your rear.

262
00:22:39,388 --> 00:22:41,288
You don't have
to worry about that.

263
00:22:41,323 --> 00:22:44,053
There's no funny business here.
I see to that.

264
00:22:44,092 --> 00:22:46,424
You think
you can do it?

265
00:22:46,461 --> 00:22:48,554
I can sure try.

266
00:23:09,151 --> 00:23:11,449
Let's see that smile, kid.

267
00:23:12,454 --> 00:23:14,046
Turn to me.

268
00:23:16,726 --> 00:23:17,818
Lift that leg a little bit.

269
00:23:19,662 --> 00:23:21,289
Yeah. And higher.

270
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:23,594
- Mmm...
- That's nice.

271
00:23:23,633 --> 00:23:26,466
I saw it. I saw beaver.

272
00:23:26,502 --> 00:23:28,697
- You're dreaming. It was a shadow.
- I saw it.

273
00:23:28,738 --> 00:23:31,104
- Mm-hmm.
- What's her name?

274
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:33,199
- It's Bettie.
- Hey, Bettie.

275
00:23:33,241 --> 00:23:35,903
Can you bend over
for us a little bit?

276
00:23:35,945 --> 00:23:39,779
- Please?
- Show us your keister?

277
00:23:45,588 --> 00:23:47,920
- Hello, keister.
- Very nice.

278
00:23:47,957 --> 00:23:49,948
Nice.

279
00:23:51,661 --> 00:23:53,652
That's good.

280
00:24:04,141 --> 00:24:07,577
To want or need
a mask to hide behind

281
00:24:07,611 --> 00:24:10,045
Comes from a distrust
of ourselves.

282
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,571
It comes from our fear
that we ourselves are boring.

283
00:24:12,615 --> 00:24:14,242
All right.
Now, let's try to go back

284
00:24:14,284 --> 00:24:16,616
to that first
object exercise...

285
00:24:16,653 --> 00:24:19,986
recreating two minutes
of ordinary life

286
00:24:20,023 --> 00:24:22,958
when we're alone.
Bettie,

287
00:24:22,992 --> 00:24:26,428
would you like to show us
what you've been working on?

288
00:24:37,541 --> 00:24:39,008
The curtain rises

289
00:24:39,042 --> 00:24:41,374
and you are sitting on stage.

290
00:24:41,412 --> 00:24:44,870
You are alone.
You sit...

291
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:47,111
and sit. At last,

292
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:49,848
the curtain comes down.

293
00:24:49,887 --> 00:24:52,355
Nothing could be simpler,
could it?

294
00:24:53,858 --> 00:24:55,587
The curtain rises...

295
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,697
the curtain comes down.

296
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:42,466
Bettie, my angel,

297
00:25:42,507 --> 00:25:45,067
it's not necessary
to remove your clothes.

298
00:25:50,582 --> 00:25:52,607
I'd like to try the exercise next
if I may.

299
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:56,381
Okay, Marvin.
Ahem.

300
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:05,286
Curtain rises.

301
00:26:22,014 --> 00:26:24,949
Curtain down.
You see,

302
00:26:24,985 --> 00:26:29,115
Marvin sat...

303
00:26:29,154 --> 00:26:32,351
and waited,
and did not act anything.

304
00:26:32,391 --> 00:26:34,359
Now, it may not seem
interesting to you,

305
00:26:34,394 --> 00:26:37,022
to sit and wait
as you do it,

306
00:26:37,063 --> 00:26:39,031
but it's life.

307
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:41,555
Now, that's all for today.
I'll see you on Wednesday.

308
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,591
Thanks.

309
00:26:49,543 --> 00:26:51,841
Hey, don't worry, Bettie.

310
00:26:51,877 --> 00:26:54,437
It's like he said...
it was a hard exercise.

311
00:26:54,481 --> 00:26:56,210
I was terrible.

312
00:26:56,249 --> 00:26:58,342
I couldn't concentrate.
I felt silly.

313
00:26:58,385 --> 00:27:01,081
No, no.
I liked what you did.

314
00:27:01,121 --> 00:27:04,716
I thought it was really interesting
and very modern.

315
00:27:04,758 --> 00:27:07,352
Don't feel bad.

316
00:27:07,394 --> 00:27:09,589
Hey, how about a milkshake?

317
00:27:11,932 --> 00:27:14,799
That was back when I was trying to write
a great American novel.

318
00:27:14,835 --> 00:27:17,360
It all seems so juvenile.
You know, trying to be Ernest Hemingway.

319
00:27:17,404 --> 00:27:21,204
But then a friend dragged me
to Herbert's class,

320
00:27:21,241 --> 00:27:24,404
and, I don't know,
acting just felt so...

321
00:27:24,445 --> 00:27:27,005
- inspiring.
- I know exactly what you mean.

322
00:27:27,048 --> 00:27:30,279
- It's like when you're in church.
- Uh-huh.

323
00:27:30,317 --> 00:27:33,081
Well, sometimes with the preaching
and the singing and all,

324
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,953
you get lifted up...
up out of yourself.

325
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:38,049
It's like you're taken
to another place.

326
00:27:38,092 --> 00:27:41,152
Yeah! Taken to another place,
that's it.

327
00:27:43,965 --> 00:27:46,559
Bettie, I feel like I've been talking about
myself for hours.

328
00:27:46,601 --> 00:27:49,399
So what about you?
What drew you to acting?

329
00:27:49,437 --> 00:27:52,304
Well, I started
in high school

330
00:27:52,341 --> 00:27:55,174
and did all the plays.
I guess you could say

331
00:27:55,209 --> 00:27:58,337
- it ruined my life.
- How so?

332
00:27:58,379 --> 00:28:01,439
Well, I was gonna be our high school
valedictorian.

333
00:28:01,482 --> 00:28:04,508
Everyone said
it was gonna be me.

334
00:28:04,553 --> 00:28:08,250
The valedictorian gets a full scholarship to
Vanderbilt University.

335
00:28:08,289 --> 00:28:10,951
- It's a real big deal.
- Hmm.

336
00:28:10,992 --> 00:28:13,426
Well, one day I...
I had a dress rehearsal

337
00:28:13,462 --> 00:28:18,092
and I cut one class...
one stupid art class.

338
00:28:18,132 --> 00:28:20,692
So I got an A-minus
instead of an A,

339
00:28:20,735 --> 00:28:23,863
and Martin Murphy
got the scholarship.

340
00:28:23,905 --> 00:28:26,601
And I got to be
salutatorian

341
00:28:26,642 --> 00:28:29,577
and a place at a teacher
training college.

342
00:28:29,611 --> 00:28:33,138
And I hated teaching. All the boys
whistled at me and acted up.

343
00:28:33,181 --> 00:28:36,378
I just couldn't
control the class.

344
00:28:36,418 --> 00:28:39,615
I wanted that
scholarship so much.

345
00:28:39,655 --> 00:28:41,714
Jeez, I'm sorry, Bettie.

346
00:28:43,191 --> 00:28:44,818
Hey, you know,

347
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:48,296
It seemed so bitter at the time,
but maybe it's fate telling you

348
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:51,128
you were meant
for something else.

349
00:28:51,166 --> 00:28:53,794
Well, I wonder.

350
00:28:53,836 --> 00:28:56,896
I hope you're right
about that.

351
00:29:09,885 --> 00:29:11,944
Yes. Like this?

352
00:29:11,988 --> 00:29:14,650
Look at that over there.
Here we go again.

353
00:29:14,691 --> 00:29:16,181
I know it's coming.

354
00:29:16,225 --> 00:29:17,852
Listen, girls,
I just want you to know

355
00:29:17,894 --> 00:29:19,623
That Peggy is gonna
be doing

356
00:29:19,661 --> 00:29:22,824
- some semi-nude posing today.
- All very tasteful, of course.

357
00:29:22,865 --> 00:29:25,993
If you're feeling shy about that,
bathing suits are just dandy with us.

358
00:29:26,035 --> 00:29:29,766
Although there's nothing more beautiful
than nude modeling in open air.

359
00:29:29,806 --> 00:29:32,741
Art, I've told you, my boyfriend
would blow his top if I did that.

360
00:29:32,775 --> 00:29:36,404
Of course, of course.
It's completely up to you.

361
00:29:36,446 --> 00:29:38,914
Thank you, Art, Frank.

362
00:29:38,948 --> 00:29:41,041
We appreciate
you telling us.

363
00:29:41,084 --> 00:29:43,348
Beautiful.

364
00:29:43,387 --> 00:29:45,753
You know, sometimes
when I get homesick,

365
00:29:45,788 --> 00:29:48,848
I just go to Central Park
and walk around for hours.

366
00:29:48,891 --> 00:29:50,859
Gee, I like
to do that too.

367
00:29:50,893 --> 00:29:54,590
Some people think I'm funny
for spending so much time alone.

368
00:29:54,631 --> 00:29:57,395
Oh, no, Bettie.
You're in very good company.

369
00:29:57,433 --> 00:30:00,732
Many of the world's greatest thinkers
spent most of their time alone.

370
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:03,705
They did?
Well, I'll be.

371
00:30:09,979 --> 00:30:12,106
I'm roasting.
Do you wanna call it quits?

372
00:30:12,149 --> 00:30:15,277
Oh, no, I'm fine.
I love the sun.

373
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:18,186
Well, we'd better move into the shade
after these shots though.

374
00:30:18,222 --> 00:30:20,554
You don't want get a mark
from your bathing suit straps.

375
00:30:20,591 --> 00:30:24,459
Well, thank you, Charlie.
That's very thoughtful of you.

376
00:30:28,098 --> 00:30:29,793
You know,

377
00:30:29,833 --> 00:30:33,769
I could take this little old
bathing suit top off if you like.

378
00:30:33,805 --> 00:30:37,172
Really?
Oh, sure, yeah.

379
00:30:37,207 --> 00:30:40,643
- if you don't mind.
- Well, I've been thinking about it...

380
00:30:40,677 --> 00:30:43,669
and what difference does it make,
a little piece of cloth?

381
00:30:43,715 --> 00:30:46,684
I agree.
Absolutely.

382
00:30:46,717 --> 00:30:49,515
Oh, thank you.

383
00:30:51,689 --> 00:30:53,316
You know, Bettie,

384
00:30:53,358 --> 00:30:55,656
You're the most popular
model at our club.

385
00:30:55,693 --> 00:30:58,526
Flattery is the devil's
tool, Charlie.

386
00:30:58,563 --> 00:31:01,157
How's this?

387
00:31:01,198 --> 00:31:02,529
I don't know
how to say this,

388
00:31:02,567 --> 00:31:05,900
and don't be offended, but...

389
00:31:05,937 --> 00:31:08,906
well, we've come
this far...

390
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:11,340
Do you think you could take off
the bottom as well?

391
00:31:11,376 --> 00:31:13,810
After all, it's just
a little piece of fabric.

392
00:31:13,845 --> 00:31:16,313
Now, don't you go throwing
my words back at me, Charlie.

393
00:31:16,347 --> 00:31:18,338
I'm... I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have asked.

394
00:31:18,383 --> 00:31:21,045
Just kidding you.
It's fine.

395
00:31:21,085 --> 00:31:23,576
Sure, I don't mind.

396
00:31:27,725 --> 00:31:29,522
Um, um...

397
00:31:42,741 --> 00:31:44,766
Bettie?

398
00:31:46,979 --> 00:31:49,379
- Bettie?
- Yes?

399
00:31:49,414 --> 00:31:52,406
If we show too much,
I could get arrested.

400
00:31:52,451 --> 00:31:54,419
- What do you mean?
- The top is okay,

401
00:31:54,453 --> 00:31:58,014
but you have
to hide that.

402
00:31:58,057 --> 00:32:00,685
Oh...

403
00:32:00,725 --> 00:32:02,716
Oh, I'll just put
the bottoms back on.

404
00:32:02,761 --> 00:32:04,991
No no no, you don't
have to do that.

405
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:07,021
Um, the backside's okay.

406
00:32:11,738 --> 00:32:14,639
How's this?

407
00:32:14,673 --> 00:32:17,870
Oh, thank you.
That's perfect.

408
00:32:52,212 --> 00:32:56,080
A copy of "She:
the Man's Picture Magazine."

409
00:32:56,116 --> 00:32:58,607
Oh, Marvin.

410
00:32:59,653 --> 00:33:01,985
A-ha, there she is.

411
00:33:02,023 --> 00:33:04,491
- In roller-skates this time.
- I know, they're silly.

412
00:33:05,892 --> 00:33:07,917
"Gals think men are beasts!

413
00:33:07,961 --> 00:33:11,362
This doll thinks a gorilla
makes a safer boyfriend. You wolf!"

414
00:33:14,268 --> 00:33:17,328
I'm not sure I like the idea
of other men seeing you like this.

415
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:20,237
It's a bathing suit, Marvin.

416
00:33:20,273 --> 00:33:22,969
- You make it look so good.
- Come on.

417
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:30,707
Yeah, I know.
I know.

418
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:35,347
- Yes... yes?
- Hi.

419
00:33:35,389 --> 00:33:38,483
I got your name from Maxie.
My name's Bettie Page. I'm a model.

420
00:33:38,526 --> 00:33:41,154
Oh, yeah. She told me about you.
Just one minute.

421
00:33:41,195 --> 00:33:44,028
Yeah, we got some
nice William Holden. Color 8x10.

422
00:33:44,065 --> 00:33:46,693
Yeah, Stewart Granger
we got, yeah.

423
00:33:46,734 --> 00:33:48,964
Just come into the store.
Anything you want, we got, okay?

424
00:33:49,003 --> 00:33:50,630
- Thank you so much.
- All right.

425
00:33:50,672 --> 00:33:52,902
- So Maxie told you about us?
- Yes.

426
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:55,966
She said there would be some
unusual costumes to put on.

427
00:33:56,010 --> 00:33:57,978
Okay, great.
Why don't you go right upstairs

428
00:33:58,012 --> 00:33:59,843
and talk to my brother
Irv while I close up here, okay?

429
00:34:00,882 --> 00:34:02,850
Klaw Studios

430
00:34:02,884 --> 00:34:06,479
featuring the largest variety
of popular model photos in the world.

431
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,886
Well, what are you
interested in?

432
00:34:08,923 --> 00:34:11,790
Films, cartoons,
pictorials?

433
00:34:11,827 --> 00:34:14,489
We got some great new pictorials in,
very high quality...

434
00:34:14,529 --> 00:34:18,090
just a moment.
Hi, I'm Irving Klaw,

435
00:34:18,132 --> 00:34:20,100
You hungry?
We've got sandwiches over there...

436
00:34:20,134 --> 00:34:23,331
- some beautiful sliced brisket.
- Oh, I'm fine, thanks.

437
00:34:23,372 --> 00:34:25,602
Okay.

438
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,870
Dressing room's
through there.

439
00:34:31,813 --> 00:34:33,940
Uh, no more "Boudoir
Beauties in High Heels."

440
00:34:33,982 --> 00:34:37,315
What about some
fighting girl movies? No?

441
00:34:37,352 --> 00:34:40,549
"Bound in Rubber,"
"Pleasure Parade,"

442
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:43,252
and "Fearful Ordeal
in Restraintland."

443
00:34:43,291 --> 00:34:45,259
Now, that last one's
an excellent seller,

444
00:34:45,293 --> 00:34:48,057
because of the quality of the poses,
which in my personal opinion

445
00:34:48,096 --> 00:34:50,724
are among the most strenuous
bondage photos ever made.

446
00:34:59,374 --> 00:35:03,174
Whoa-whoa, how anyone walks
in these old shoes is beyond me.

447
00:35:03,212 --> 00:35:05,043
You don't have far to go.
Jack, give her a hand.

448
00:35:05,081 --> 00:35:06,776
- Oh, hello.
- Pleased to meet you.

449
00:35:06,815 --> 00:35:10,342
- Nice to meet you.
- These shoes are kind of unusual.

450
00:35:10,386 --> 00:35:12,081
We get a lot of requests
for them, don't we, Irving?

451
00:35:12,121 --> 00:35:14,919
Sure do... 8" stiletto heels,
black seamed stockings,

452
00:35:14,957 --> 00:35:18,051
12 different poses.
High heels are very popular.

453
00:35:18,094 --> 00:35:20,426
- There you go.
- Okay, sit her down there, Jack.

454
00:35:20,463 --> 00:35:23,091
All right, Bettie.
Let's go.

455
00:35:23,132 --> 00:35:25,464
Beautiful, Bettie.

456
00:35:25,501 --> 00:35:28,868
Oh! I think we got a little problem.
Something's peeking out.

457
00:35:28,905 --> 00:35:31,533
Oh, yep. We better put
another pair over them.

458
00:35:31,574 --> 00:35:33,804
Yeah, we gotta put these
over the ones you got on.

459
00:35:33,843 --> 00:35:37,279
These will be okay, huh?
As if the customers care.

460
00:35:37,313 --> 00:35:40,407
It's the shoes they want.
Shoes and boots, boots and shoes...

461
00:35:40,451 --> 00:35:42,248
- they can't get enough of them.
- Why?

462
00:35:42,286 --> 00:35:46,052
Don't ask. It takes all types
to make a world.

463
00:35:46,089 --> 00:35:47,579
What kind of types?

464
00:35:50,861 --> 00:35:53,091
You see, the customers
who want this stuff,

465
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:56,588
they're very respectable,
very high quality people...

466
00:35:56,632 --> 00:35:59,192
doctors, lawyers,
diplomats...

467
00:35:59,235 --> 00:36:01,430
Even a judge.
They're not people like us.

468
00:36:01,472 --> 00:36:04,270
The pressures they've got...
they're not your average Joe.

469
00:36:04,308 --> 00:36:07,709
So what if they want something
that seems a little strange, right?

470
00:36:07,744 --> 00:36:10,008
- If it makes them happy?
- Sure.

471
00:36:10,047 --> 00:36:13,414
Sometimes they come into the store, and
I can see they want something different.

472
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:14,974
Irving says I can
spot them a mile off.

473
00:36:15,018 --> 00:36:19,011
- Oh, she can. She's got an instinct.
- If I think it's shoes they want,

474
00:36:19,056 --> 00:36:21,957
I'll pull out a movie star...
Lana Turner, let's say,

475
00:36:21,992 --> 00:36:25,086
with a nice pair of high heels...
and I'll point to them and say,

476
00:36:25,129 --> 00:36:27,461
"Hmm, something
like this, maybe?"

477
00:36:27,498 --> 00:36:31,195
Oh, the look on their face...
like they're so relieved I understand.

478
00:36:31,236 --> 00:36:33,295
And then I start pulling
out the special stuff.

479
00:36:33,337 --> 00:36:36,363
Look at the time.
We gotta go.

480
00:36:36,406 --> 00:36:38,840
- Jack, let's put some music on.
- Okay.

481
00:36:38,876 --> 00:36:40,707
Let's put some music.
You like music, Bettie?

482
00:36:40,745 --> 00:36:43,009
- Oh, yeah.
- You okay, Bettie? The shoes hurting?

483
00:36:43,047 --> 00:36:45,106
I'm fine. Just fine.

484
00:36:45,149 --> 00:36:47,140
Turn your backside to us
so we can see the stocking seams.

485
00:36:47,184 --> 00:36:49,550
Nice nice.

486
00:36:50,622 --> 00:36:53,056
Wonderful, Bettie.

487
00:36:53,091 --> 00:36:56,686
To me, turn to me.
Great!

488
00:36:56,728 --> 00:36:58,992
It's nice, right?
Just get into it, feel it.

489
00:37:03,501 --> 00:37:05,833
Gorgeous gorgeous.
Oh, you're so happy.

490
00:37:09,542 --> 00:37:11,806
She's great.

491
00:37:11,843 --> 00:37:13,470
Oh, that's right, honey.

492
00:37:13,511 --> 00:37:15,502
Do that cha-cha,
give me that.

493
00:37:15,547 --> 00:37:18,414
Great, Bettie.
Gorgeous.

494
00:37:18,449 --> 00:37:21,475
Listen to this..."you have
long stretches of nervous letdown

495
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,114
in playing your part,
complete artistic impotence.

496
00:37:24,155 --> 00:37:27,124
At such times your playing
is lifeless, stilted."

497
00:37:27,158 --> 00:37:29,217
I think he was talking
about me there.

498
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:32,718
No, no, he's talking
about all of us.

499
00:37:32,765 --> 00:37:36,929
I'm just so nervous. Uh, they liked
the photographs I sent them,

500
00:37:36,968 --> 00:37:39,459
- but they never heard me speak.
- It's a western, right?

501
00:37:39,505 --> 00:37:41,564
- Uh-huh.
- Well, maybe they'll need

502
00:37:41,607 --> 00:37:43,905
a good Southern girl.
Just remember, acting is about truth.

503
00:37:43,943 --> 00:37:46,275
You find truth in the character
and no one will give a damn

504
00:37:46,312 --> 00:37:49,213
- that you're from Tennessee.
- Settle down.

505
00:37:55,321 --> 00:37:57,585
Okay, start from here.

506
00:37:57,623 --> 00:38:01,059
Come on, turn.

507
00:38:01,093 --> 00:38:04,153
Not... slowly
slowly, not so quick.

508
00:38:06,298 --> 00:38:08,323
And look at me

509
00:38:08,367 --> 00:38:10,426
with your beautiful eyes.

510
00:38:13,305 --> 00:38:14,567
Now, this way.

511
00:38:17,943 --> 00:38:20,434
Straight.

512
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,414
Now, say something nice.

513
00:38:25,017 --> 00:38:27,577
Um...

514
00:38:29,155 --> 00:38:30,952
I don't know know what to say.

515
00:38:30,991 --> 00:38:33,858
Come on, we're recording sound
so you can say something.

516
00:38:39,366 --> 00:38:43,097
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be so sorry, okay?

517
00:38:43,136 --> 00:38:45,070
You're behaving
like a six-year-old, okay?

518
00:38:45,105 --> 00:38:47,801
Come on, look at me
with your beautiful eyes.

519
00:38:50,677 --> 00:38:52,668
And?

520
00:38:55,448 --> 00:38:57,382
Ahem...

521
00:38:57,417 --> 00:39:00,147
hi, I'm Bettie Page.

522
00:39:00,187 --> 00:39:02,417
Um...

523
00:39:02,455 --> 00:39:05,549
I'm from Nashville,
Tennessee.

524
00:39:07,727 --> 00:39:10,662
Right. Okay, that's it.
You're all done, sweetie.

525
00:39:12,833 --> 00:39:15,301
I thought you looked really great
under the lights.

526
00:39:15,335 --> 00:39:18,099
You're a knockout.
Real star material.

527
00:39:18,138 --> 00:39:21,869
Uh, you think so?
I was awfully nervous.

528
00:39:21,909 --> 00:39:23,774
You'll have to work
on that accent, of course,

529
00:39:23,811 --> 00:39:26,905
But it would be no fun
if you were perfect.

530
00:39:28,515 --> 00:39:30,676
Say, why don't you have
dinner with me tonight?

531
00:39:30,718 --> 00:39:33,448
I could give you a few pointers.
We could get to know each other better.

532
00:39:33,487 --> 00:39:36,456
Oh, I'm sorry, but I can't.
I already have a boyfriend.

533
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:40,051
Oh, come on.
It'll be fun.

534
00:39:40,094 --> 00:39:43,291
It's always an advantage
to know the producer personally.

535
00:39:43,331 --> 00:39:45,891
I really have to go.

536
00:39:47,668 --> 00:39:50,228
You try and do
a girl a favor...

537
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:58,638
Still not tight enough.

538
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:02,013
I told you, it won't go any tighter.
I've been trying for 20 minutes.

539
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:04,883
You'll ruin the whole thing because
you're too lazy to do it properly.

540
00:40:04,919 --> 00:40:07,820
Oh, come off it.

541
00:40:07,855 --> 00:40:11,313
- Set the shot up the way I told you.
- Okay, I got it, I got it.

542
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,453
Bettie, you're supposed
to be here at 10:00.

543
00:40:13,495 --> 00:40:16,396
You're not on the clock, you don't
get paid. Irving, you're in the shot.

544
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:18,591
- Okay.
- Ahem.

545
00:40:22,504 --> 00:40:26,201
Give it in the eyes.
Give it in the eyes, darling.

546
00:40:26,241 --> 00:40:28,334
- Beautiful.
- Can we see a bit of heel maybe?

547
00:40:28,376 --> 00:40:30,708
- A little bit of heel.
- Uh, that's good,

548
00:40:30,746 --> 00:40:32,941
A little bit of bum.
I really like bum.

549
00:40:32,981 --> 00:40:35,176
- That's perfect.
- Lovely bum, darling.

550
00:40:35,217 --> 00:40:36,548
See, she's one of our best.

551
00:40:36,585 --> 00:40:40,021
And then he admitted
that he paid Roz 12 bucks an hour,

552
00:40:40,056 --> 00:40:41,887
And they gave me 10.
Cheek of it!

553
00:40:41,923 --> 00:40:44,118
So I says to Irving,
"Pardon me,

554
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:45,786
but who's been freezing
her derriere off

555
00:40:45,827 --> 00:40:48,921
every Saturday for the past six months?
Not Roz Greenwood.

556
00:40:48,965 --> 00:40:52,833
Gee, that's not fair. Roz is real nice,
but you're a better model.

557
00:40:52,868 --> 00:40:55,803
- Everyone says so.
- Hey, girls, how you doing?

558
00:40:55,837 --> 00:40:57,964
Yeah, we're cold.
Can we get another heater in here?

559
00:40:58,006 --> 00:41:00,998
I'll see what I can do.
Bettie, if you keep brushing your hair,

560
00:41:01,043 --> 00:41:04,012
it'll fall out of your head.
Let me explain something to you.

561
00:41:04,046 --> 00:41:06,241
This is one of our
private sessions... John.

562
00:41:06,281 --> 00:41:08,909
We call him "Little John" to tell him
apart from the other John, "Big John."

563
00:41:08,951 --> 00:41:10,680
He's the photographer
out there.

564
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:14,247
Anyway, Little John has some
special outfits he'd like you to put on.

565
00:41:14,290 --> 00:41:16,918
- I'd say they're special.
- Maxie.

566
00:41:16,959 --> 00:41:19,894
Yeah, all right, some of them are
a real hoot, but he's a very nice man.

567
00:41:19,929 --> 00:41:22,227
Yeah, he's not normal,

568
00:41:22,265 --> 00:41:24,233
- but he's nice.
- he's one of our best customers,

569
00:41:24,267 --> 00:41:26,098
So will you try
and do what he says?

570
00:41:29,072 --> 00:41:31,768
- What does she mean?
- Oh, it's nothing bad,

571
00:41:31,808 --> 00:41:34,106
You just have to scare him
and act mean. Like this.

572
00:41:36,779 --> 00:41:39,009
Actually,
it's kind of fun.

573
00:41:39,049 --> 00:41:41,677
You're lucky.
Wait until you see what I have to do.

574
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:47,817
Hey! Ouch, that's too tight.

575
00:41:47,857 --> 00:41:50,985
Well, that is rather the point, my dear.
The tighter the better.

576
00:41:51,028 --> 00:41:52,893
- Paula.
- Maxie, are they hurting you?

577
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:54,921
- She's all right. Aren't you, Maxie?
- I am not.

578
00:41:54,964 --> 00:41:57,159
- I'm getting rope burns.
- All right. Let's get a move on.

579
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,964
Bettie, stand over there.

580
00:42:01,538 --> 00:42:05,030
I'd like this young lady
to look very strict.

581
00:42:05,075 --> 00:42:07,339
He'd like her
to look very strict.

582
00:42:07,376 --> 00:42:10,243
He'd like you to look
very strict.

583
00:42:22,025 --> 00:42:25,324
Come on, my dear,
more passion. Fire.

584
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:33,036
More... tigress,
huh?

585
00:42:41,846 --> 00:42:43,541
Whoa, very good.

586
00:42:43,581 --> 00:42:45,913
Dominate the men
who adore you.

587
00:42:45,949 --> 00:42:48,850
Crush them with
your exquisite high heels!

588
00:42:54,759 --> 00:42:58,559
"Come, fill the cup.
And in the fire of spring

589
00:42:58,596 --> 00:43:01,258
the winter garment
of repentance fling."

590
00:43:01,299 --> 00:43:03,961
Oh, that's very nice.
Is that from a poem?

591
00:43:04,002 --> 00:43:08,530
Not just a poem, my dear, the poem...
"The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam."

592
00:43:08,574 --> 00:43:10,542
Whoa... oh, no, thank you.
I don't drink.

593
00:43:10,575 --> 00:43:13,339
Come on,
have a drink with me.

594
00:43:13,378 --> 00:43:16,779
Most of the time these last six months,
I seem to be drinking by myself

595
00:43:16,814 --> 00:43:18,805
or with strangers
whom I don't much like.

596
00:43:21,786 --> 00:43:23,583
Might I tempt you
with a mushroom cap?

597
00:43:23,621 --> 00:43:26,215
Oh. So what do you do,
Little John?

598
00:43:26,257 --> 00:43:28,418
He has a very successful
legal practice

599
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:31,554
- with many distinguished clients.
- How is business, John?

600
00:43:31,597 --> 00:43:33,588
- You been keeping busy?
- Uh, quite busy,

601
00:43:33,631 --> 00:43:35,599
But mother hasn't
been very well

602
00:43:35,633 --> 00:43:37,965
So I've been spending
a lot of time at home with her.

603
00:43:38,003 --> 00:43:39,470
Sorry to hear it.

604
00:43:39,505 --> 00:43:43,498
And what about those legal
difficulties you mentioned?

605
00:43:43,542 --> 00:43:46,272
I had a letter
from the postal inspector warning me

606
00:43:46,311 --> 00:43:49,371
about sending some of my pictures
through the mail. What do you know

607
00:43:49,415 --> 00:43:51,883
- about getting around that?
- The only court ruling

608
00:43:51,917 --> 00:43:53,885
that I know of
on that issue

609
00:43:53,919 --> 00:43:55,887
is the case of this fellow,
Al Urban.

610
00:43:55,921 --> 00:43:57,582
The post office tried
to prevent him

611
00:43:57,624 --> 00:43:59,888
from sending photographs
of nude men through the mail.

612
00:43:59,925 --> 00:44:02,086
They got the Civil
Liberties Union involved

613
00:44:02,127 --> 00:44:04,527
And the Chicago court
eventually ruled that the materials

614
00:44:04,563 --> 00:44:06,326
- were not obscene.
- We don't even have nudes.

615
00:44:06,365 --> 00:44:09,163
He just had to be careful he was
only sending his stuff to adults.

616
00:44:09,202 --> 00:44:13,298
Tell me, what do you think
of all this tying-up business?

617
00:44:13,339 --> 00:44:15,307
You seem to have
a knack for posing.

618
00:44:15,341 --> 00:44:18,105
And I'm always on the lookout
for comely wenches

619
00:44:18,144 --> 00:44:20,442
who don't mind a bit
of the old rope and gag.

620
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,472
Well, it certainly
was different.

621
00:44:23,515 --> 00:44:26,575
I liked what you did
with that riding crop.

622
00:44:26,619 --> 00:44:29,679
It's a treat to see a girl
with so much spirit.

623
00:44:29,723 --> 00:44:31,918
Oh, I enjoy acting
very much.

624
00:44:31,958 --> 00:44:33,926
I've been taking lessons.

625
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:36,588
Oh... we shall have
to put you

626
00:44:36,629 --> 00:44:38,961
in a little film
or something, shan't we?

627
00:44:40,066 --> 00:44:42,296
Little John old cock,

628
00:44:42,335 --> 00:44:45,429
What say we give
this charming creature a role

629
00:44:45,472 --> 00:44:49,533
in "Sally's Punishment"?
I bet she's a dab hand with the cords.

630
00:47:16,159 --> 00:47:17,558
Could you stop there,
please?

631
00:47:19,395 --> 00:47:22,853
These films include bondage,
spanking and flagellation,

632
00:47:22,899 --> 00:47:25,424
all illegal to send
through the U.S. mails.

633
00:47:25,468 --> 00:47:27,595
I will need you
to sign a stipulation

634
00:47:27,638 --> 00:47:29,606
stating that you will
agree not to sell

635
00:47:29,639 --> 00:47:32,574
any films, photographs
or drawings depicting these acts.

636
00:47:32,608 --> 00:47:35,634
Sir, if I may,
my client sells

637
00:47:35,678 --> 00:47:39,045
a number of photographs
of stills from Hollywood films.

638
00:47:39,082 --> 00:47:43,041
Take one, for example,
from "Tarzan and the Slave Girl"...

639
00:47:43,085 --> 00:47:46,851
a scantily clad actress
is tied up.

640
00:47:46,890 --> 00:47:49,825
Lash marks are
visible on her back.

641
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:53,296
Now, this film passed
the National Board of Review.

642
00:47:53,330 --> 00:47:55,321
What is your point,
Mr. Gangel?

643
00:47:55,364 --> 00:47:58,162
Well, certainly, you can't
intend for my client to stop selling

644
00:47:58,202 --> 00:48:00,796
these Hollywood
film stills, Inspector.

645
00:48:00,838 --> 00:48:04,137
Those images represent a minute part
of a feature-length film

646
00:48:04,174 --> 00:48:06,768
intended as harmless
entertainment.

647
00:48:06,810 --> 00:48:09,904
Mr. Klaw's films
and photographs are created

648
00:48:09,947 --> 00:48:12,279
with the deliberate intention
of inciting lust

649
00:48:12,316 --> 00:48:15,217
and lascivious thoughts,
and should therefore be barred

650
00:48:15,252 --> 00:48:17,345
from being sent
through the mails.

651
00:48:17,388 --> 00:48:19,185
If you do not cease
and desist,

652
00:48:19,223 --> 00:48:21,191
this will become a matter
for the courts.

653
00:48:40,812 --> 00:48:42,803
Hi, girls.

654
00:48:43,814 --> 00:48:45,782
That looks
very artistic.

655
00:48:45,816 --> 00:48:47,784
- What's it called?
- "Bettie's Clown Dance."

656
00:48:47,819 --> 00:48:50,014
- Very nice.
- How'd it go?

657
00:48:50,054 --> 00:48:53,114
- Not good.
- You look terrible. Is that your heart?

658
00:48:53,157 --> 00:48:55,489
- Did you get the fluttering again?
- Ah, no no no, I'm fine.

659
00:48:55,525 --> 00:48:58,926
- Bettie, that's all for today.
- Listen, Bettie,

660
00:48:58,963 --> 00:49:00,954
I hope you don't mind...
we need to take

661
00:49:00,999 --> 00:49:03,399
a little break from production,
maybe a couple of weeks.

662
00:49:03,434 --> 00:49:06,801
- Sure.
- Take off. Take a vacation.

663
00:49:06,839 --> 00:49:09,364
You know where I'd go
if I could ever get away from here?

664
00:49:09,407 --> 00:49:13,309
- Where would you go?
- Miami Beach.

665
00:49:13,344 --> 00:49:16,541
That's where I'm gonna go
if I ever get to retire.

666
00:49:16,582 --> 00:49:20,416
Sit in the sand
and watch the waves.

667
00:49:20,451 --> 00:49:24,319
Sun and fun, Bettie.

668
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:30,220
Dear Goldie, guess what.

669
00:49:30,262 --> 00:49:32,696
I decided to take
a vacation.

670
00:49:32,730 --> 00:49:35,563
I've been spending
loads of time on the beach.

671
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:39,195
The water is so clear
and so blue.

672
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:44,604
Now I've been working too.
A friend gave me

673
00:49:44,643 --> 00:49:46,440
an introduction
to a photographer

674
00:49:46,478 --> 00:49:49,345
who takes beautiful
artistic pictures.

675
00:49:49,381 --> 00:49:53,647
I hear she's one of the top
glamour photographers working today.

676
00:49:53,686 --> 00:49:56,951
Her name is
Miss Bunny Yeager.

677
00:49:56,990 --> 00:50:00,187
- Miss Yeager?
- You must be Bettie.

678
00:50:00,225 --> 00:50:03,160
Please step this way.

679
00:50:05,264 --> 00:50:08,700
- Would you like some water?
- Yes, I would. Thank you.

680
00:50:11,971 --> 00:50:13,836
- Is this you?
- Yes.

681
00:50:13,872 --> 00:50:17,672
That was taken in Hawaii.
I was a model too.

682
00:50:17,711 --> 00:50:19,406
You brought
some clothes with you.

683
00:50:22,314 --> 00:50:24,942
I made this.

684
00:50:33,827 --> 00:50:36,057
Is this what
you normally pose in?

685
00:50:36,096 --> 00:50:38,656
Yes.
What do you think?

686
00:50:38,698 --> 00:50:40,689
Well, maybe the bathing suit
and the stockings.

687
00:50:40,734 --> 00:50:42,702
Not the corset.

688
00:50:42,736 --> 00:50:46,263
I believe the female form
can stand on its own.

689
00:50:46,307 --> 00:50:48,298
In fact, I'd like
to see you in the light.

690
00:50:48,341 --> 00:50:51,208
Do you mind standing
over here by the window?

691
00:50:55,316 --> 00:50:57,841
And what brings you
to Miami, Bettie?

692
00:50:57,885 --> 00:50:59,853
I don't know.

693
00:50:59,886 --> 00:51:02,320
Well, I love the sunshine,
love the ocean.

694
00:51:02,355 --> 00:51:06,052
Well, that's perfect.
I do some of my best work outdoors.

695
00:51:09,030 --> 00:51:10,895
Yes, she's been shot

696
00:51:10,931 --> 00:51:13,058
by just about every
photographer in the country,

697
00:51:13,099 --> 00:51:15,624
but I think I caught
something special

698
00:51:15,669 --> 00:51:18,729
in her personality
when I photographed Bettie Page.

699
00:51:18,773 --> 00:51:20,832
The first thing I noticed was
that for some reason,

700
00:51:20,875 --> 00:51:23,742
when she's nude,
she doesn't seem naked.

701
00:51:23,778 --> 00:51:25,746
Maybe it's just her all-over
coppery tan,

702
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:28,374
or maybe just her attitude.

703
00:51:28,416 --> 00:51:30,384
Whatever it is,
it conveyed to me

704
00:51:30,418 --> 00:51:33,114
that here is
a true nudist.

705
00:51:33,154 --> 00:51:35,645
Bettie's attitude
towards her lovely healthy body

706
00:51:35,690 --> 00:51:37,920
is the essence of nudism.

707
00:51:42,196 --> 00:51:44,357
"Dear Goldie,

708
00:51:44,398 --> 00:51:46,366
yes, they made
a postcard of yours truly...

709
00:51:46,401 --> 00:51:48,460
a bunch of them,
in fact.

710
00:51:48,503 --> 00:51:51,472
I had a wonderful time at the beach here,
and made some money too.

711
00:51:51,505 --> 00:51:53,473
Wish you could have
been here with me.

712
00:51:53,507 --> 00:51:55,475
Hope to see you
at Christmas.

713
00:51:55,510 --> 00:51:58,741
I can't wait to walk through those
old piney woods again.

714
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:01,248
Love, Bettie."

715
00:52:06,254 --> 00:52:08,222
What are you bringing us
for Christmas, bricks?

716
00:52:08,256 --> 00:52:10,190
Hope you got
something good for me.

717
00:52:10,225 --> 00:52:13,956
You won't be getting a thing
if you don't stop bellyaching.

718
00:52:13,994 --> 00:52:17,555
And thank you for giving us this food
when others are in want.

719
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:19,829
And thank you, Lord,
for the blessing of family.

720
00:52:19,868 --> 00:52:22,632
Please shine your precious light
on our son Jimmy,

721
00:52:22,671 --> 00:52:24,764
who's in mobile and can't
be with us today.

722
00:52:24,806 --> 00:52:28,503
And on this day of celebration,
let us say a prayer for Roy Page

723
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:30,306
And, Lord, help us
to forgive him

724
00:52:30,345 --> 00:52:32,176
for abandoning
his wife and family.

725
00:52:32,214 --> 00:52:35,775
For what we are about to receive
may the Lord make us truly thankful.

726
00:52:35,818 --> 00:52:38,787
- Amen.
- Amen.

727
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:41,311
Jack, don't take
all the mashed potatoes.

728
00:52:41,356 --> 00:52:44,018
Save some
for the rest of us.

729
00:52:44,059 --> 00:52:46,027
So have you met
Marilyn Monroe yet?

730
00:52:46,062 --> 00:52:49,225
No, Jack. She lives in Hollywood.
I'm in New York.

731
00:52:49,265 --> 00:52:51,096
A man from
"The Tennessean" called.

732
00:52:51,133 --> 00:52:53,294
- Says he wants to interview you.
- He did?

733
00:52:53,335 --> 00:52:56,304
Says you were voted "Pin-Up
Queen of the Universe."

734
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:57,897
Oh my.

735
00:52:57,940 --> 00:53:00,204
How long are you gonna
make a living doing that?

736
00:53:00,243 --> 00:53:03,212
Uh, you know, Mama,
I'll get by.

737
00:53:03,245 --> 00:53:05,076
All that teacher training.

738
00:53:05,114 --> 00:53:08,174
It just seems a shame
to waste an education.

739
00:53:09,185 --> 00:53:11,176
You know I hated teaching.

740
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:13,347
I wish mama would
just let that be.

741
00:53:13,389 --> 00:53:15,448
Has mama said anything to you
about my modeling?

742
00:53:15,491 --> 00:53:19,154
Not a word. But a few weeks ago,
I was rooting around in her closet.

743
00:53:19,195 --> 00:53:23,131
Suddenly, I came across a whole
stack of magazines with you in them.

744
00:53:23,166 --> 00:53:25,726
- Not the nudist ones.
- Of course not.

745
00:53:25,769 --> 00:53:28,704
Just the glamour stuff.
You still look good in a swimsuit.

746
00:53:28,738 --> 00:53:31,366
Oh, I never was
as pretty as you.

747
00:53:37,347 --> 00:53:40,248
Madam, as I live
and hope for salvation...

748
00:53:40,283 --> 00:53:43,343
- Ha!
- Aye, I am as like to be saved as thou

749
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:47,789
that believes naught save some
black magic of words and verses.

750
00:53:47,824 --> 00:53:50,759
Oh, madam, if you would
know what misery is,

751
00:53:50,794 --> 00:53:54,696
listen to this man who is more
than man and less at the same time.

752
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:58,758
He will tie you down
to anatomize your very soul,

753
00:53:58,802 --> 00:54:01,635
he will wring tears of blood
from your humiliation,

754
00:54:01,672 --> 00:54:06,371
and then he will heal the wound
with flatteries no woman can resist.

755
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:08,742
Madam, she is jealous,

756
00:54:08,779 --> 00:54:10,747
and heaven help me,
not without reason,

757
00:54:10,781 --> 00:54:13,807
for how can I be content
with this black-haired,

758
00:54:13,850 --> 00:54:16,318
black-eyed,
blackavised devil

759
00:54:16,354 --> 00:54:19,915
now that I have looked
upon real beauty and real majesty?

760
00:54:19,957 --> 00:54:23,256
Oh, he is compact
of lies and scorns.

761
00:54:23,293 --> 00:54:25,386
I'm tired of being
tossed up to heaven

762
00:54:25,430 --> 00:54:28,661
and dragged down to hell
with every whim that takes him.

763
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:31,362
I am, of all ladies,
most deject

764
00:54:31,401 --> 00:54:33,767
and wretched.

765
00:54:33,804 --> 00:54:36,034
We know from Stanislavski

766
00:54:36,074 --> 00:54:39,373
that there can be
no true art without living.

767
00:54:39,410 --> 00:54:42,038
To reproduce feelings,

768
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:45,139
you must be able to identify them
out of your own experience.

769
00:54:45,183 --> 00:54:47,981
Now, Bettie,

770
00:54:48,019 --> 00:54:50,783
would you tell the class
what you did

771
00:54:50,822 --> 00:54:55,282
to find the truth
in the lady-in-waiting's emotions?

772
00:54:55,326 --> 00:54:59,490
Well, I tried to think of something
that would make me really scared.

773
00:54:59,530 --> 00:55:01,794
And what was that, Bettie?

774
00:55:01,833 --> 00:55:05,394
I thought of what Jesus might do to me
for all my sins.

775
00:55:05,437 --> 00:55:08,634
Marvelous.

776
00:55:46,879 --> 00:55:48,870
Are you sure?

777
00:55:48,914 --> 00:55:50,905
Okay, I'll get back to you.

778
00:55:55,055 --> 00:55:57,023
This is quite
an elegant knot, really.

779
00:55:57,056 --> 00:55:58,751
The more
the subject pulls,

780
00:55:58,791 --> 00:56:01,692
the tighter
the knot becomes.

781
00:56:01,727 --> 00:56:04,252
- What did the lawyer say?
- Not good. It's not good. Can I have

782
00:56:04,297 --> 00:56:06,060
- a word with you in the office?
- Of course.

783
00:56:06,099 --> 00:56:08,567
Carry on.
You're off the clock at 9:00.

784
00:56:43,036 --> 00:56:45,027
What's the matter, Bettie?

785
00:56:49,809 --> 00:56:51,674
Watch your language,
Mr. Willie.

786
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:53,406
Oh, it's just
an old army ditty.

787
00:56:53,446 --> 00:56:55,380
It helped keep
our spirits up

788
00:56:55,416 --> 00:56:57,281
while we were fighting
the beastly Hun.

789
00:56:57,318 --> 00:56:59,286
Don't you approve?

790
00:56:59,319 --> 00:57:01,219
I believe in Jesus.

791
00:57:02,589 --> 00:57:05,456
But of course
you do, my dear.

792
00:57:09,397 --> 00:57:11,388
Of course you do.

793
00:57:27,948 --> 00:57:30,109
Do you mind if I ask
you a question, Bettie?

794
00:57:40,027 --> 00:57:43,019
What do you think Jesus would say
about what you're doing now?

795
00:57:45,901 --> 00:57:48,301
Well, Mr. Willie...

796
00:57:49,703 --> 00:57:52,171
I've thought about this
quite a bit.

797
00:57:53,174 --> 00:57:55,301
I'm not really sure
anymore.

798
00:57:56,311 --> 00:57:59,109
I think God has
given each of us

799
00:57:59,147 --> 00:58:01,775
some kind of talent
and he wants us to use it.

800
00:58:01,816 --> 00:58:03,807
That's why
he gave it to us.

801
00:58:06,221 --> 00:58:09,054
Mr. Willie, would you mind
untying my hands?

802
00:58:09,090 --> 00:58:12,025
- It's hard for me to think like this.
- Certainly.

803
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:16,292
God gave me the talent
to pose for pictures,

804
00:58:16,331 --> 00:58:19,926
and it seems to make
people happy.

805
00:58:19,968 --> 00:58:22,766
Well, that can't be
a bad thing, can it?

806
00:58:22,804 --> 00:58:26,035
Not to me, it's not.
But what does God think?

807
00:58:26,074 --> 00:58:28,668
Well, I can't say
for certain.

808
00:58:28,710 --> 00:58:31,008
I can't speak for him.

809
00:58:31,046 --> 00:58:33,071
I do worry sometimes

810
00:58:33,115 --> 00:58:35,379
about some of the things

811
00:58:35,418 --> 00:58:37,545
- that I've done.
- What things?

812
00:58:41,356 --> 00:58:44,883
I posed naked
for photographs.

813
00:58:47,163 --> 00:58:49,222
Have you, my dear?

814
00:58:51,032 --> 00:58:53,557
You naughty girl.

815
00:58:53,603 --> 00:58:58,040
But is that really bad? Adam and Eve
were naked in the Garden of Eden.

816
00:58:58,074 --> 00:59:01,100
So they were.

817
00:59:01,143 --> 00:59:04,169
Oh, I don't know what God
thinks about all this.

818
00:59:04,213 --> 00:59:06,909
I hope that
if he's unhappy

819
00:59:06,949 --> 00:59:09,008
with what I'm doing,

820
00:59:09,051 --> 00:59:11,019
he'll let me know
somehow.

821
00:59:11,053 --> 00:59:13,351
I'm sure he will,
my dear.

822
00:59:13,390 --> 00:59:15,449
I'm sure he will.

823
00:59:25,903 --> 00:59:28,929
Did you love it?

824
00:59:28,971 --> 00:59:31,872
Bettie, you love
of my life!

825
00:59:31,908 --> 00:59:34,206
Oh, come on in.

826
00:59:34,244 --> 00:59:36,712
- What's your poison? Whiskey?
- Orange juice, please.

827
00:59:36,747 --> 00:59:39,477
Oh, Bettie, you will kill me.
You're such a square.

828
00:59:39,515 --> 00:59:41,483
Hey, would you do me
a favor and grab those?

829
00:59:41,517 --> 00:59:43,815
Bettie, come on, there's somebody
you gotta meet. He'll murder me

830
00:59:43,854 --> 00:59:46,220
if I don't introduce you.

831
00:59:48,825 --> 00:59:51,692
Did anyone ever tell you you look
like Montgomery Clift?

832
00:59:51,727 --> 00:59:53,024
No.

833
00:59:53,063 --> 00:59:54,690
Howie, Howie.

834
00:59:54,731 --> 00:59:57,063
- I'd like you to meet Bettie Page.
- Hi.

835
00:59:57,100 --> 00:59:58,897
Howie Lippman.
Pleasure. Listen,

836
00:59:58,936 --> 01:00:01,530
I've got this sensational
new nightclub opening next week.

837
01:00:01,572 --> 01:00:03,403
We've got a full orchestra,
a floor show,

838
01:00:03,441 --> 01:00:06,569
comedians, a juggling act...
we're pulling out all the stops.

839
01:00:06,610 --> 01:00:08,441
I'd love it if you
and some of your friends

840
01:00:08,478 --> 01:00:10,207
would come down
and and see us.

841
01:00:10,247 --> 01:00:12,306
Did you see that girl?
The black-haired job over there?

842
01:00:12,349 --> 01:00:13,976
- That's Bettie Page.
- No, really?

843
01:00:14,018 --> 01:00:17,510
That's her? She looks different
with her clothes on.

844
01:00:17,554 --> 01:00:20,546
There will be a lot of press.
You could wind up in Winchell's column,

845
01:00:20,591 --> 01:00:22,821
- and "Hello, career," right?
- You're Bettie Page,

846
01:00:22,860 --> 01:00:24,327
- aren't you?
- Yes, I am.

847
01:00:24,362 --> 01:00:27,729
I'm really
sorry to bother you,

848
01:00:27,765 --> 01:00:30,598
I heard you might
be here. Um...

849
01:00:30,634 --> 01:00:32,465
I have a lot
of your pictures.

850
01:00:32,503 --> 01:00:35,028
If you don't mind, do you think
you could sign this for me?

851
01:00:35,073 --> 01:00:38,133
- Sure.
- And could you tell me something?

852
01:00:38,176 --> 01:00:41,805
Does it just make you sick
to see guys like me grovel like this?

853
01:00:41,845 --> 01:00:45,076
Oh, no, it's fine.
It's flattering.

854
01:00:45,116 --> 01:00:48,745
Don't you just wanna
crush us, humiliate us,

855
01:00:48,786 --> 01:00:50,617
punish us?

856
01:00:50,655 --> 01:00:53,647
No, sir. I'm sure you're
a very nice person.

857
01:00:53,691 --> 01:00:56,159
Hey, there you are, doughnut.
Hello, there.

858
01:00:56,194 --> 01:00:57,821
Here you go.

859
01:00:57,862 --> 01:00:59,591
- Thanks.
- Hey, are you signing autographs?

860
01:00:59,631 --> 01:01:02,566
- Can I see?
- Thank you.

861
01:01:04,837 --> 01:01:06,805
Hmm...

862
01:01:06,838 --> 01:01:09,204
"Long black stockings,"
hmm...

863
01:01:13,212 --> 01:01:16,841
"200 excellent poses."

864
01:01:16,882 --> 01:01:20,648
"Bound and gagged"?
"Rubber masks"?

865
01:01:20,685 --> 01:01:23,449
- Bettie, what is this?
- Oh, it's just some silly photographs

866
01:01:23,489 --> 01:01:25,514
I did for Irving
and Paula.

867
01:01:25,557 --> 01:01:28,321
Bettie, I...

868
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:30,328
I don't think you
understand what this is.

869
01:01:30,361 --> 01:01:32,955
It's just...

870
01:01:32,998 --> 01:01:35,023
- weird.
- It's just costumes, Marvin.

871
01:01:35,067 --> 01:01:37,661
We're just dressing up.
There's no harm in it.

872
01:01:37,703 --> 01:01:40,695
Bettie, doctors
write books

873
01:01:40,739 --> 01:01:42,866
about this sort of thing.
It's...

874
01:01:42,908 --> 01:01:45,342
- it's abnormal.
- For goodness sake, Marvin,

875
01:01:45,377 --> 01:01:47,345
- I'm not nude.
- Bettie,

876
01:01:47,379 --> 01:01:51,213
Do you understand what kind of man
buys these pictures?

877
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:52,877
They're for special customers

878
01:01:52,919 --> 01:01:54,910
who like these kinds
of costumes...

879
01:01:54,954 --> 01:01:56,922
high-quality people.
I met one of them.

880
01:01:56,955 --> 01:01:59,924
He's a lawyer. He's very nice.
Wouldn't hurt a fly.

881
01:01:59,958 --> 01:02:01,926
These people you work for...

882
01:02:01,961 --> 01:02:03,952
is this what they ask
you to do?

883
01:02:05,031 --> 01:02:06,999
Who are these people?!

884
01:02:07,033 --> 01:02:09,763
They're very nice people,
Marvin.

885
01:02:09,802 --> 01:02:12,862
Look... this thing
in your mouth,

886
01:02:12,906 --> 01:02:15,500
- what is this?
- It's just a prop, Marvin.

887
01:02:15,542 --> 01:02:17,737
It's just silliness.
We're laughing all the time

888
01:02:17,777 --> 01:02:20,041
- when we're doing this stuff.
- Bettie,

889
01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:23,606
it... it's disgusting.

890
01:02:30,490 --> 01:02:33,084
I'm gonna
go get some air.

891
01:03:16,971 --> 01:03:19,496
- Hi.
- Hi.

892
01:03:19,540 --> 01:03:21,667
Will you take
a picture of me?

893
01:03:21,709 --> 01:03:23,336
- Yeah.
- It's silly.

894
01:03:23,377 --> 01:03:25,242
People take pictures
of me all the time,

895
01:03:25,279 --> 01:03:27,747
but I don't know
how to take one of myself.

896
01:03:27,782 --> 01:03:29,909
Shall I just stand
right here?

897
01:03:29,950 --> 01:03:31,747
Yeah.

898
01:03:32,788 --> 01:03:34,449
You just press
the little button there.

899
01:03:34,488 --> 01:03:36,479
Okay.

900
01:03:43,031 --> 01:03:45,022
Here's your camera, Miss.

901
01:03:49,270 --> 01:03:52,706
- Where are you going after the beach?
- Home.

902
01:03:52,741 --> 01:03:55,301
Would you like
to go out with me?

903
01:03:55,343 --> 01:03:57,174
Uh-huh.

904
01:03:57,212 --> 01:04:00,773
- I'm Bettie.
- Hi.

905
01:04:00,815 --> 01:04:02,840
- I am Armand.
- Oh...

906
01:04:02,884 --> 01:04:06,650
- it's nice to meet you, Armand.
- Nice to meet you too.

907
01:04:37,586 --> 01:04:40,077
Don't think for a minute
that the jungle abounds

908
01:04:40,121 --> 01:04:42,715
with cuties like this.
That pretty hairdo

909
01:04:42,758 --> 01:04:44,783
and that naughty
little leopard skin

910
01:04:44,827 --> 01:04:47,489
are products
of a complex civilization.

911
01:04:47,530 --> 01:04:49,498
Of course,
what lies underneath

912
01:04:49,531 --> 01:04:51,396
Is both civilized
and primitive...

913
01:04:51,434 --> 01:04:54,597
depending on her mood.

914
01:04:58,074 --> 01:05:00,269
I'm gonna send these pictures
to a new magazine.

915
01:05:00,309 --> 01:05:02,277
It's called "Playboy."
Do you know of it?

916
01:05:02,311 --> 01:05:04,745
- No, ma'am, I don't think I do.
- Well, it's new...

917
01:05:04,780 --> 01:05:07,214
very tasteful magazine,
printed on beautiful paper.

918
01:05:07,250 --> 01:05:09,184
It's very classy.
Look towards me, please.

919
01:05:09,218 --> 01:05:10,776
- Like this?
- Perfect.

920
01:05:10,820 --> 01:05:13,015
Now, Bettie, the magazine wants
to know how old you are.

921
01:05:13,056 --> 01:05:16,048
- I'm 32.
- Oh...

922
01:05:16,092 --> 01:05:18,060
well, I never
would have guessed.

923
01:05:18,094 --> 01:05:20,289
I don't think you should
tell them that, though.

924
01:05:20,329 --> 01:05:23,628
No magazine wants
a model who's over 25.

925
01:05:23,667 --> 01:05:25,965
Smile, Bettie.

926
01:05:27,003 --> 01:05:28,971
Okay, I need you
to lift your knee up.

927
01:05:29,005 --> 01:05:31,872
I'm seeing
a little bit too much.

928
01:05:31,909 --> 01:05:33,570
You know what's funny?
Irving Klaw

929
01:05:33,610 --> 01:05:35,407
Would never let me pose
with my top off.

930
01:05:35,445 --> 01:05:38,039
- Irving Klaw?
- Yeah, you know him?

931
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:40,571
No. I think I heard his name on TV
last night, though.

932
01:05:40,616 --> 01:05:43,414
- Some government investigation.
- Irving on television?

933
01:05:43,453 --> 01:05:45,421
Yeah, I think he's
in a little bit of trouble

934
01:05:45,455 --> 01:05:47,719
- What kind of trouble?
- I'm sure it's nothing.

935
01:05:47,758 --> 01:05:50,488
It's probably just some senators
blowing a lot of hot air.

936
01:05:50,526 --> 01:05:53,427
Eyes to the camera,
please.

937
01:05:53,463 --> 01:05:55,954
How about a wink?

938
01:06:02,307 --> 01:06:04,537
We shall show
by these hearings

939
01:06:04,574 --> 01:06:07,168
that a large portion
of the market for this material

940
01:06:07,210 --> 01:06:10,737
is with inquisitive
and impressionable teenagers.

941
01:06:10,782 --> 01:06:14,582
There is a peculiar resemblance
to narcotics addiction

942
01:06:14,619 --> 01:06:16,746
in exposure of juveniles
to pornography,

943
01:06:16,787 --> 01:06:19,017
but there is one difference,
however...

944
01:06:19,056 --> 01:06:22,355
the injection of heroin
into the veins of an addict

945
01:06:22,393 --> 01:06:24,361
stops with the addict,

946
01:06:24,395 --> 01:06:26,955
but the contaminative
effects of pornography

947
01:06:26,998 --> 01:06:29,762
in the hands
of just one minor

948
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:32,166
are incapable
of measuring.

949
01:06:37,342 --> 01:06:39,276
Irving says they
can't shoot anymore

950
01:06:39,310 --> 01:06:42,302
- until they sort this out.
- Yeah.

951
01:06:42,347 --> 01:06:44,315
Maybe it's time
I stopped modeling

952
01:06:44,349 --> 01:06:46,317
and just worked hard
at my acting.

953
01:06:46,351 --> 01:06:49,514
People are getting tired
of taking pictures of me anyhow.

954
01:06:49,554 --> 01:06:51,784
Never.

955
01:06:51,824 --> 01:06:54,224
What are you gonna do?

956
01:06:54,258 --> 01:06:56,726
- I got a plan.
- You do?

957
01:06:56,761 --> 01:06:59,059
You know Frank and Charlie
from the camera club?

958
01:06:59,097 --> 01:07:00,758
- Yeah.
- A couple of months ago,

959
01:07:00,799 --> 01:07:03,495
they asked to borrow my apartment
for a private session.

960
01:07:03,535 --> 01:07:05,628
So I said,
"What's in it for me?"

961
01:07:05,670 --> 01:07:07,297
So they paid me
a little something,

962
01:07:07,338 --> 01:07:09,636
And then it became
a regular thing every Thursday.

963
01:07:09,674 --> 01:07:12,234
Then another couple of guys
asked, and I thought,

964
01:07:12,277 --> 01:07:14,245
"Why not go into business

965
01:07:14,279 --> 01:07:17,180
- for myself?"
- How?

966
01:07:17,215 --> 01:07:19,206
Well, I got myself
a white fur rug.

967
01:07:19,250 --> 01:07:21,218
- Nice.
- Well, not real fur,

968
01:07:21,253 --> 01:07:23,016
but good enough
for pictures.

969
01:07:23,055 --> 01:07:25,649
And a couple of pillars.
That's on one side.

970
01:07:25,691 --> 01:07:29,787
And on another wall, I'm gonna
get a mural painted of an Italian lake;

971
01:07:29,827 --> 01:07:33,422
And maybe a fake fireplace on another
wall, so I can shoot three sides

972
01:07:33,465 --> 01:07:35,626
and get the most
out of the space.

973
01:07:38,737 --> 01:07:41,399
Do you think Paula
will be upset?

974
01:07:41,441 --> 01:07:44,467
- Maybe. It's competition.
- Mmm...

975
01:07:44,510 --> 01:07:47,104
But you got to look
after yourself in this world.

976
01:07:47,146 --> 01:07:49,671
And you can't be
a model forever.

977
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:55,654
I was reading
the theater section

978
01:07:55,687 --> 01:07:58,451
of the goddamned "New York Times"
today, and a drawing of this guy,

979
01:07:58,490 --> 01:08:00,890
Petruchio, swinging a whip
in "The Taming of the Shrew"...

980
01:08:00,927 --> 01:08:03,725
the play by Shakespeare...
is all over the first page.

981
01:08:03,763 --> 01:08:05,856
- Nobody cares.
- They're all hypocrites.

982
01:08:05,899 --> 01:08:08,424
Then, I see this illustration
in the "New York Times Magazine"

983
01:08:08,467 --> 01:08:11,265
Of "Kiss Me Kate," a Broadway musical.
What does it show?

984
01:08:11,304 --> 01:08:13,602
Spanking!

985
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:17,576
They wanna shut me down for distributing
images almost identical to these.

986
01:08:17,610 --> 01:08:20,773
Shh. Don't say too much.
Remember what the lawyer said.

987
01:08:24,651 --> 01:08:27,552
I'm beginning to get
a persecution fear complex.

988
01:08:27,587 --> 01:08:28,884
Don't.

989
01:08:32,058 --> 01:08:34,925
- You are Mr. Klaw?
- Yes.

990
01:08:34,961 --> 01:08:38,089
Mr. Klaw, were you...

991
01:08:39,432 --> 01:08:41,992
Sir, in accordance
with your suggestion,

992
01:08:42,036 --> 01:08:44,095
we don't want
any pictures.

993
01:08:47,140 --> 01:08:50,007
Thank you very much.
We appreciate your cooperation.

994
01:08:51,011 --> 01:08:52,979
Uh, Mr... Klaw,
were you requested

995
01:08:53,013 --> 01:08:54,981
to bring any
books or records?

996
01:08:55,015 --> 01:08:57,176
- Yes.
- do you have them, sir?

997
01:08:58,885 --> 01:09:01,046
I decline to make
them available

998
01:09:01,088 --> 01:09:03,215
under the 5th amendment
of the constitution,

999
01:09:03,257 --> 01:09:05,987
that they may tend to degrade
or incriminate me;

1000
01:09:06,026 --> 01:09:08,392
and under the 4th amendment
of the constitution

1001
01:09:08,428 --> 01:09:10,293
that the subpoena
is vague and illegal.

1002
01:09:10,331 --> 01:09:12,299
Do you wish to make
any statement as to why

1003
01:09:12,333 --> 01:09:16,030
you think producing any books
or records called for here

1004
01:09:16,070 --> 01:09:18,129
might tend
to incriminate you?

1005
01:09:20,608 --> 01:09:23,941
I decline to answer under the 5th
amendment of the constitution,

1006
01:09:23,978 --> 01:09:26,378
that an answer
may tend to incriminate me.

1007
01:09:33,554 --> 01:09:36,648
Dr. Henry, I direct
your attention

1008
01:09:36,690 --> 01:09:39,250
to a booklet entitled
"Cartoon and Model Parade,"

1009
01:09:39,293 --> 01:09:42,387
published by Irving Klaw
of 212 east 14th street.

1010
01:09:42,430 --> 01:09:44,398
I specifically call
your attention

1011
01:09:44,432 --> 01:09:46,900
to the movie
"Negligee Fight."

1012
01:09:46,934 --> 01:09:51,064
The heading reads
that this 16mm movie

1013
01:09:51,106 --> 01:09:53,074
shows the terrific battle
that ensues

1014
01:09:53,108 --> 01:09:56,202
when both girls
claim a black negligee.

1015
01:09:56,244 --> 01:09:58,439
Is this
the masochistic type

1016
01:09:58,479 --> 01:10:00,811
of perversion to which
we just referred?

1017
01:10:00,849 --> 01:10:04,148
- It is.
- Is there a sexual deviation

1018
01:10:04,186 --> 01:10:06,586
known as "bondage,"
where a person

1019
01:10:06,621 --> 01:10:09,613
- is trussed up with rope and chains?
- Yes.

1020
01:10:09,659 --> 01:10:12,321
- That is fairly common.
- You say that...

1021
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:14,351
that bondage
is fairly common?

1022
01:10:14,396 --> 01:10:16,694
Fairly common
in this particular group...

1023
01:10:16,731 --> 01:10:18,699
that is, the group
of sexual deviants.

1024
01:10:18,733 --> 01:10:21,634
Tell us more
about that...

1025
01:10:21,671 --> 01:10:23,764
uh... bondage being
fairly common.

1026
01:10:23,805 --> 01:10:25,636
Among those
that are familiar

1027
01:10:25,674 --> 01:10:27,642
with this variety
of sexual deviation,

1028
01:10:27,676 --> 01:10:29,735
it is a matter
of common knowledge to them.

1029
01:10:29,779 --> 01:10:32,270
You mean they like to see
someone who is bound up...

1030
01:10:32,315 --> 01:10:34,215
- Yes, they do.
- Pictures of them?

1031
01:10:34,250 --> 01:10:36,946
- Some of them do.
- Now I direct your attention

1032
01:10:36,985 --> 01:10:42,116
to a series of photographs
called "New Specially Posed."

1033
01:10:42,158 --> 01:10:44,388
"Bettie can only feel fear

1034
01:10:44,427 --> 01:10:47,624
as she is unable to see
her captors.

1035
01:10:47,662 --> 01:10:50,324
Now that the pole
was bound to her body,

1036
01:10:50,366 --> 01:10:54,063
Bettie had to crawl
on all fours like an animal.

1037
01:10:54,103 --> 01:10:57,937
The floor made
Bettie's knees red and sore.

1038
01:10:57,974 --> 01:11:01,842
The unwieldy steel brank
kept slipping back and forth,

1039
01:11:01,877 --> 01:11:04,812
Irritating the tender flesh
at Bettie's neck,

1040
01:11:04,847 --> 01:11:07,077
thus making the cold steel
an added menace.

1041
01:11:07,116 --> 01:11:10,574
It was most exhausting,

1042
01:11:10,621 --> 01:11:14,853
But Bettie's strength and endurance
were equal to the task."

1043
01:11:14,890 --> 01:11:16,915
Doctor, could I ask you...
could... could...

1044
01:11:16,959 --> 01:11:19,427
could children
be sexually perverted

1045
01:11:19,463 --> 01:11:23,058
- by looking at photos of this nature?
- Yes.

1046
01:11:23,100 --> 01:11:25,091
Would you say it is
a fair statement

1047
01:11:25,134 --> 01:11:27,102
that suicide, murder
and psychosis

1048
01:11:27,136 --> 01:11:29,127
is the result
of this type of trash?

1049
01:11:29,172 --> 01:11:32,733
In some instances, yes.

1050
01:11:36,346 --> 01:11:38,007
Mr. Grimm,

1051
01:11:38,047 --> 01:11:40,948
I want say as Chairman
of this Subcommittee...

1052
01:11:40,984 --> 01:11:42,975
I know the embarrassment
and the distaste

1053
01:11:43,020 --> 01:11:44,988
you have
in coming here

1054
01:11:45,022 --> 01:11:46,990
to talk about the tragic
happening to your son

1055
01:11:47,024 --> 01:11:49,584
on August 20th
of last year.

1056
01:11:49,626 --> 01:11:51,924
We appreciate
your cooperation.

1057
01:11:51,962 --> 01:11:55,489
- Mr. Gaughan, you may proceed.
- Can you, Mr. Grimm,

1058
01:11:55,532 --> 01:11:59,332
tell the subcommittee how it was
that your boy met his sudden end

1059
01:11:59,370 --> 01:12:01,861
on the evening
of August 20th, 1950?

1060
01:12:01,905 --> 01:12:04,237
Now, I realize
it is an unsolved murder,

1061
01:12:04,274 --> 01:12:05,673
but tell us
what you know.

1062
01:12:05,709 --> 01:12:07,939
He'd worked all day for me,

1063
01:12:07,978 --> 01:12:10,776
come home dirty and tired
in his work clothes.

1064
01:12:12,050 --> 01:12:14,883
He was away all evening,
which was unusual.

1065
01:12:14,918 --> 01:12:17,318
He never left the house
without telling us.

1066
01:12:20,291 --> 01:12:23,055
I found him the next morning
in a very...

1067
01:12:23,094 --> 01:12:25,756
grotesque, weird situation
that I've never been able

1068
01:12:25,797 --> 01:12:28,425
to cope with
or understand yet.

1069
01:12:31,069 --> 01:12:33,765
He was um...

1070
01:12:33,805 --> 01:12:37,536
trussed up
in a very unnatural position.

1071
01:12:38,943 --> 01:12:41,776
Looked like it had
been planned in some way.

1072
01:12:43,181 --> 01:12:45,411
He wasn't hung like
most people hang themselves

1073
01:12:45,450 --> 01:12:47,543
by the neck from a rope.

1074
01:12:47,585 --> 01:12:50,748
And the fact that he didn't
have any clothes on...

1075
01:12:50,789 --> 01:12:53,849
he was a modest boy...
led me immediately to believe

1076
01:12:53,891 --> 01:12:55,882
that there was
some sex angle to it.

1077
01:12:55,927 --> 01:12:58,919
Mr. Grimm, do you recognize, sir,
that booklet,

1078
01:12:58,964 --> 01:13:01,626
entitled
"Cartoon and Model Parade,"

1079
01:13:01,667 --> 01:13:05,103
published by Irving Klaw
the Pin-up King?

1080
01:13:06,571 --> 01:13:08,539
- Yes.
- Would you tell the Subcommittee

1081
01:13:08,573 --> 01:13:11,133
how you first came across
a copy of this book?

1082
01:13:11,176 --> 01:13:13,144
Through a mutual friend

1083
01:13:13,178 --> 01:13:15,203
who was interested
in the case.

1084
01:13:15,247 --> 01:13:18,648
I found very similar pictures
of tying people up in this book

1085
01:13:18,684 --> 01:13:21,710
that reminded me
of my son's case.

1086
01:13:21,754 --> 01:13:24,416
I've never come across
anything like that before.

1087
01:13:24,456 --> 01:13:26,424
I was looking for a clue.

1088
01:13:26,458 --> 01:13:29,723
Sir, let me direct your attention
specifically to page four.

1089
01:13:29,762 --> 01:13:33,198
That picture illustrates
a model named Bettie Page.

1090
01:13:33,232 --> 01:13:36,030
Does that accurately
reflect how your boy was found?

1091
01:13:36,068 --> 01:13:39,765
It's more or less the same...
a very similar position.

1092
01:13:39,806 --> 01:13:41,797
I haven't had the police into it.
They let the case rest.

1093
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:43,808
They said it was
some sort of accident

1094
01:13:43,842 --> 01:13:46,936
due to some impulse
on the part of the boy.

1095
01:13:46,979 --> 01:13:49,812
I-I don't care
what the police think.

1096
01:13:49,849 --> 01:13:52,409
The way he was tied... it wasn't
anything any youngster like him

1097
01:13:52,452 --> 01:13:55,080
with his character
could concoct himself.

1098
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:58,248
There wasn't any history of that,
no similar action on his part.

1099
01:13:58,290 --> 01:14:01,020
He led an outdoor life.

1100
01:14:01,060 --> 01:14:02,687
He was active
in the boy scouts

1101
01:14:02,729 --> 01:14:05,061
from the time he was
a little bit of a fellow.

1102
01:14:06,865 --> 01:14:09,231
He had only been home
for two days from boys' camp

1103
01:14:09,269 --> 01:14:11,669
in Tennessee when...

1104
01:14:12,672 --> 01:14:14,663
when I found him.

1105
01:14:15,875 --> 01:14:17,672
I feel he could not
have put himself

1106
01:14:17,709 --> 01:14:20,075
into this position
of his own making.

1107
01:14:20,113 --> 01:14:22,081
It... it had to be
brought to his attention

1108
01:14:22,115 --> 01:14:24,083
either by someone else
showing him how

1109
01:14:24,117 --> 01:14:26,585
or he saw
a picture of it.

1110
01:14:26,619 --> 01:14:28,587
I do feel there is
a definite connection

1111
01:14:28,622 --> 01:14:30,590
between this sort of thing
and his death.

1112
01:14:30,623 --> 01:14:33,558
And I also feel there is
a definite evil to this,

1113
01:14:33,593 --> 01:14:37,051
and I'm bound and determined
to do what I can to suppress it.

1114
01:14:38,064 --> 01:14:40,396
This is not
a healthy situation!

1115
01:14:40,434 --> 01:14:43,494
It's not wholesome.
There's nothing cultural about it.

1116
01:14:43,536 --> 01:14:45,527
It's just no damn good!

1117
01:14:49,477 --> 01:14:52,708
And that's all I got
to say about it.

1118
01:15:02,223 --> 01:15:04,919
- Miss Page?
- Yes, sir?

1119
01:15:04,959 --> 01:15:08,292
Your testimony is no longer necessary.
You can go now.

1120
01:15:08,329 --> 01:15:11,696
What do you mean?
I've been sitting here for 12 hours.

1121
01:15:11,732 --> 01:15:14,257
Why is it no longer
necessary?

1122
01:15:14,301 --> 01:15:16,531
They didn't give
an explanation, ma'am.

1123
01:15:17,538 --> 01:15:19,802
Do I have to come
back tomorrow?

1124
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:22,673
No, ma'am.
They said they won't need you anymore.

1125
01:15:22,710 --> 01:15:24,701
You can go.

1126
01:15:47,836 --> 01:15:50,100
Our girls had fun doing this.
A fetish?

1127
01:15:50,138 --> 01:15:52,629
Do you got a fetish?
I don't got a fetish.

1128
01:15:52,674 --> 01:15:55,234
All we were interested in
was taking pictures and making money.

1129
01:15:55,277 --> 01:15:57,541
We gotta burn them...
burn up those negatives

1130
01:15:57,578 --> 01:16:00,274
- and they'll get off our backs.
- Are you crazy?

1131
01:16:00,315 --> 01:16:02,840
After all that work?
Years and years of work.

1132
01:16:02,884 --> 01:16:06,786
I've had it. Come on,
there's no point anymore.

1133
01:16:06,821 --> 01:16:08,812
The lawyers, the money...

1134
01:16:08,858 --> 01:16:11,053
I'm gonna get out of here
and retire to Florida,

1135
01:16:11,092 --> 01:16:12,992
sit in the sun
and enjoy life.

1136
01:16:13,028 --> 01:16:15,690
All this stuff's
wearing me out.

1137
01:16:15,730 --> 01:16:17,925
"You needn't try
to comfort me.

1138
01:16:17,967 --> 01:16:20,458
I haven't come here
on any but equal terms.

1139
01:16:20,503 --> 01:16:23,597
You said, 'Let's talk truthfully.'
Well, let's do.

1140
01:16:23,638 --> 01:16:27,369
Unsparingly, truthfully,
even shamelessly then.

1141
01:16:27,409 --> 01:16:30,435
It's no longer a secret
that I love you. It never was.

1142
01:16:30,479 --> 01:16:33,107
I loved you as long ago
as the time I asked you

1143
01:16:33,149 --> 01:16:35,515
to read the stone angel's name
with your fingers.

1144
01:16:35,550 --> 01:16:39,452
Yes, I remember the long
afternoons of our childhood,

1145
01:16:39,488 --> 01:16:41,752
when I had to stay indoors
to practice my music

1146
01:16:41,791 --> 01:16:44,157
and I heard the playmates
calling you...

1147
01:16:44,193 --> 01:16:47,094
'Johnny! Johnny!"'

1148
01:16:48,497 --> 01:16:51,660
Not bad. Not bad at all.
Thanks for coming in.

1149
01:16:54,270 --> 01:16:57,171
It's quite a treat to meet
the notorious Bettie Page.

1150
01:17:02,445 --> 01:17:04,413
Send the next one in.

1151
01:17:24,467 --> 01:17:26,958
Let's get out of here,
make a fresh start.

1152
01:17:28,472 --> 01:17:30,804
Look at what this life
is doing to you.

1153
01:17:37,046 --> 01:17:39,037
Hey, Bettie.

1154
01:17:40,217 --> 01:17:42,845
Bettie!

1155
01:17:44,388 --> 01:17:46,288
Bettie?

1156
01:17:46,323 --> 01:17:48,314
Bettie?

1157
01:17:49,559 --> 01:17:51,550
Bettie.

1158
01:18:17,588 --> 01:18:20,785
Sweetheart, do you
want something to eat?

1159
01:19:45,077 --> 01:19:47,068
Oh, my God...

1160
01:19:48,515 --> 01:19:51,609
tonight, I know that
first things come first

1161
01:19:51,651 --> 01:19:53,619
and the most important
thing of all

1162
01:19:53,652 --> 01:19:55,620
is that men and women
and young people

1163
01:19:55,654 --> 01:19:57,622
surrender their lives
to Christ.

1164
01:19:57,657 --> 01:20:00,854
God, don't let
a mother's boy

1165
01:20:00,894 --> 01:20:03,419
who heard me preach here tonight
go to hell.

1166
01:20:03,463 --> 01:20:06,455
Don't let a mother's girl
who heard me tonight go to hell.

1167
01:20:06,498 --> 01:20:10,093
Don't let a daddy or a mother
who heard me preach tonight go to hell.

1168
01:20:10,136 --> 01:20:13,628
- Save them!
- Amen.

1169
01:20:13,673 --> 01:20:16,403
Save them tonight...

1170
01:20:16,442 --> 01:20:18,069
from all their sins.

1171
01:20:18,111 --> 01:20:20,705
May they be born again,
washed in the blood,

1172
01:20:20,747 --> 01:20:23,238
saved through and through
without the loss of any,

1173
01:20:23,283 --> 01:20:25,046
I pray.
Amen.

1174
01:20:25,084 --> 01:20:27,075
Amen.

1175
01:20:37,231 --> 01:20:39,222
Did you get
saved tonight?

1176
01:20:42,368 --> 01:20:44,336
Didn't quite make it,
but you came up

1177
01:20:44,370 --> 01:20:46,804
and made a stand,
didn't you?

1178
01:20:46,841 --> 01:20:49,309
- What's your name?
- Bettie.

1179
01:20:49,343 --> 01:20:51,709
Are you ready for me
to pray for you, Bettie?

1180
01:20:52,713 --> 01:20:55,409
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

1181
01:21:04,124 --> 01:21:05,751
O, Father,

1182
01:21:05,793 --> 01:21:08,728
we ask You that You deliver
this woman from sin.

1183
01:21:08,762 --> 01:21:11,196
Destroy it
by the spirit of God.

1184
01:21:11,232 --> 01:21:14,633
Heal her through and through,
including her heart.

1185
01:21:15,769 --> 01:21:18,397
Make her a new creature
in Christ.

1186
01:21:27,148 --> 01:21:28,979
What did you say?

1187
01:21:31,852 --> 01:21:34,218
A wonderful...

1188
01:21:34,255 --> 01:21:37,383
- a wonderful feeling.
- Did it come then?

1189
01:21:38,894 --> 01:21:40,862
Yes, sir.
I believe it did.

1190
01:21:40,896 --> 01:21:44,593
- What did it feel like?
- It was, uh...

1191
01:21:46,501 --> 01:21:49,993
- a lifting up.
- You felt a lifting up?

1192
01:21:51,907 --> 01:21:54,637
Well...

1193
01:21:54,676 --> 01:21:56,667
amen.

1194
01:22:40,189 --> 01:22:44,751
"And God shall wipe
all tears from their eyes

1195
01:22:44,794 --> 01:22:47,319
and there shall be
no more death,

1196
01:22:47,363 --> 01:22:50,594
neither sorrow,
nor crying,

1197
01:22:50,633 --> 01:22:52,794
neither shall there be
any more pain,

1198
01:22:52,835 --> 01:22:56,202
for the former things
are passed away.

1199
01:22:56,239 --> 01:22:59,037
And He that sat
upon the throne said,

1200
01:22:59,075 --> 01:23:02,238
'Behold, I make
all things new."'

1201
01:23:02,278 --> 01:23:05,873
- You're Bettie Page, aren't you?
- Yes, I am.

1202
01:23:05,916 --> 01:23:08,578
Bettie Page the Pin-Up
Queen of the Universe?

1203
01:23:08,618 --> 01:23:10,586
What, what
happened to you?

1204
01:23:10,619 --> 01:23:13,247
I've turned my life
over to the Lord.

1205
01:23:13,289 --> 01:23:16,349
- No kidding.
- I left all that behind me.

1206
01:23:16,393 --> 01:23:18,452
God doesn't want me
to pose anymore.

1207
01:23:18,495 --> 01:23:21,953
Oh, no offense meant.
Your pictures were pretty tame.

1208
01:23:21,999 --> 01:23:24,559
The stuff they sell now on
the newsstands'll make your hair curl.

1209
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:27,433
You don't have to be ashamed
of what you did.

1210
01:23:27,471 --> 01:23:29,962
I'm not ashamed.

1211
01:23:30,007 --> 01:23:33,340
Adam and Eve were naked
in the Garden of Eden, weren't they?

1212
01:23:33,377 --> 01:23:36,744
When they sinned,
they put on clothes.

1213
01:23:41,985 --> 01:23:45,318
"And He said unto me,
'It is done.

1214
01:23:45,355 --> 01:23:48,324
I am Alpha and Omega...

1215
01:23:48,358 --> 01:23:50,622
the beginning and the end.

1216
01:23:50,660 --> 01:23:54,357
I will give unto him that
is athirst of the fountain

1217
01:23:54,398 --> 01:23:57,390
of the water
of life freely.

1218
01:23:57,435 --> 01:24:00,836
He that overcometh
shall inherit all things

1219
01:24:00,871 --> 01:24:02,839
and I will be his God,

1220
01:24:02,873 --> 01:24:05,603
and he will be My son.

1221
01:24:05,643 --> 01:24:09,670
But the fearful,
and unbelieving..."'

1222
01:24:30,234 --> 01:24:33,795
- How's it going?
- Oh, fine, almost finished.
