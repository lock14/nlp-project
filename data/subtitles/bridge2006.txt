PREVIOUSLY
- This is new.
- Next murder. Freddie and the child.
Who's the third, then?
Poor, poor girl.
My investigation is finished.
The material will go to the prosecutor.
Do you know what I think? Your dad's death, your
mom's murder, the internal investigation and Hans...
It was too much.
I think it's all this with
Holst and his child -
- that's raking up all sorts of
old shit inside me.
Show yourself, dammit!
L369G42.
Hello!
Donor was a Freddie Holst. There is a
confirmed fertilization and pregnancy.
- And the mother?
- An Anna Maria Larsson.
Hi, Dad.
EPISODE 10
- Rasmus?
- I know where they are now.
It's a closed factory. A concrete factory.
- Are Emil and the child there?
- No, I didn't see them. Didn't see anyone.
Okay. Stay there.
Wait for reinforcements.
Okay.
Change.
Why? I don't have anything on me...
Just do it.
Mom said that my dad was a prince
who lived in a castle in France.
Like Santa Claus.
First you believe in him -
- but then you realize he doesn't exist.
Please. Please, you must not hurt him.
THE BRIDGE
Did you see where they went?
- He shot me.
- You had your vest on.
Have you ever been shot?
It hurts even with a vest.
- Did you see the car?
- Yeah, it was a Peugeot Partner. Silver.
License plate?
- Come on.
- It was...
It was Swedish.
- For fuck's sake, man! Come on!
- Yeah, wait.
- HUB 382.
- You just remembered that?
- Lay off.
- Henrik.
- What happened?
- We have no fucking idea where they are.
- Thanks to Wonderboy over there.
- Annika Melander is awake.
- We're going there now.
- Good.
"Wait for reinforcements."
How hard can that be to understand?
Sorry. I...
- We lived in the same foster home.
- We know Emil. Tell us what happened.
I was going to Göteborg. We met.
We hadn't seen each other for many years.
I had time for a cup of coffee, and then...
Then I woke up in that room.
But you were in the same
foster family at the Johanssons'.
- Did you treat him badly?
- No one had it good there.
That wasn't what I asked.
No, I...
I treated him like I
treated all the others.
Why do you want to know that?
Because Emil is taking revenge on
everyone he thinks hurt him.
- I didn't do anything.
- He kidnapped you to frame you for several murders.
I don't know why.
So you have no idea where he could be now?
- No.
- Good.
Was I reported missing when I was gone?
No.
Claes Sandberg, he didn't
report me missing?
No, he seemed mostly relieved
that you were gone.
She lied about how she treated
Emil at the foster home.
That suggests they didn't do this together.
We continue the surveillance anyway.
He'd built an exact copy of
the room in the cellar.
- How does the room in Ystad look now?
- We've removed the barricade.
If it means so much to him, that
could be where he is.
I had a painting in my room.
A copy of an amateur painting by a
Danish artist who was rightfully forgotten.
But that painting was the only
beautiful thing in my life.
You think I'm exaggerating. Sure you do.
I used to fantasize about how it
would be in there.
It could contain anything.
Anything could happen there.
And now we're there, in the painting.
How magical it is.
Do you want to hold him?
Then came that psycho Morten Anker
and I got to know about you.
An interest in art.
That that was inherited.
It was like everything died.
Do you understand that?
I wanted to make everything you
love ugly and distorted.
I hoped that you would see it.
You're an art connoisseur, for fuck's sake.
Why didn't you see it, Dad?
Was it not good enough, or what?
I don't know.
No, it wasn't good enough.
The house is secured. It's empty.
- Do you think Emil lived down here?
- Maybe.
- Or else it was a time-out room.
- A time-out room, what's that?
An empty and boring room where one puts a child
for a time to stop undesirable behavior.
As punishment?
Some scientists think that the child sees it as a
consequence of destructive behavior, not as punishment.
- Okay.
- But they're wrong.
- The painting...
- What about it?
It's exactly the same as in the
room we found Annika in.
- Everything is the same.
- No. The bed is another brand.
The wash basin... another brand.
They're similar, but not identical.
But the painting there is exactly the same.
The car that Rasmus saw was reported
stolen yesterday morning in Lomma.
- There's no trace?
- Not yet.
- What is that?
- A painting.
- Yes, I see that.
- It's from the foster home where Emil lived.
Find out who the artist is, what it's called,
and if it depicts a place that exists.
Okay.
Everything we had on Annika Melander
matches Emil Larsson, too.
We also have a connection
between him and Helle Anker.
We had him and let him go two times.
- You had no reason to suspect him of it.
- It was still a mistake.
Saga, Henrik. Come here.
I scanned the signature and found this.
Claus Arnesen, Danish artist.
He's painted thousands of landscapes.
- Is it called anything?
- 'A Very Fine Day', from '93.
- Where was it painted?
- No idea.
He's made these kinds of paintings
in all the Nordic countries.
- Is he alive?
- Yeah, he turns 76 this year.
After becoming a pensioner, settled in
Saltholm, right between Malmo and Copenhagen.
- Do you have a phone number?
- I'll send it.
- Saltholm? Can you even live there?
- Apparently.
- Saga Norén...
- Linn Björkman?
- Yes, that's me.
- I'm from Forensics in Lund.
It's regarding a painting that you painted.
- Do you have a minute?
- Not really. Is it important?
- Is it related to our case?
- No, but it's important.
- Can I send you a photo of it?
- Keep me informed at all times.
Thanks.
- What did he want?
- He wanted to talk to Linn.
He's painted hundreds of paintings
called 'A Very Fine Day' -
- and he has neither a computer nor a
phone, so we can't send him any photos.
We have to go there.
The helicopter from Göteborg,
wasn't it flown down here?
- Yes.
- John.
What can I do to stop you?
- When were you last afraid?
- I'm afraid now.
I've been afraid every
day since I was five.
No one should have to experience that.
I didn't know anything about you.
You can't punish someone for that.
I'm not punishing you.
I'm correcting a mistake that was made.
Get up.
Get up!
Up with you. Up with you!
Claus Arnesen? Saga Norén, Malmo Police.
This is my partner, Henrik Sabroe.
Saga Norén, Malmo Police.
This is my partner, Henrik Sabroe.
It was I who called you earlier.
Do you recognize this?
I can't see it. Come in.
I just need... my glasses.
- No, they're not there.
- Aren't they?
- Do you know where they might be?
- By the bed, maybe?
- What do you want with my pictures?
- One of them came up in a murder investigation.
- What?
- One of them came up in a murder investigation.
- Here you go.
- Yes. Let's see.
- Do you recognize this?
- Yeah, it's mine. I made it.
- In 1993. Can you remember where?
- No, you...
I can't remember that. I've made
hundreds of these pictures.
There's a building in the background.
Do you recognize it?
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I can see it.
- Do you know where it is?
- Yes, there.
Where is 'there'?
South. On the eastern side.
As in here on the island?
That barn is here on the island?
Yeah, yeah. It's just a couple
kilometers away. Maybe three.
What do we do? The helicopter?
- Then he'll hear us coming.
- Yeah, but it's faster.
But he'll hear us coming.
He has Freddie and the child.
Okay.
Stop.
I understand.
Saga called.
We think we know where they are.
- Where?
- Saltholm.
Go up.
No.
Then I'll shoot you, and you won't know
what happens with little brother.
Put the noose on.
Don't do this.
- I must.
- You don't need to do anything. You're not choosing.
- You always have a choice.
- Only if you have power.
The powerless can never choose.
They only have themselves.
Now you can hold him
as long as you're conscious.
I assume you'll drop him.
- He can't take the fall.
- No. No one can take the fall.
You and me, together inside a painting.
A very fine day.
- What now? Reinforcements are coming.
- We can't wait.
Come. Here. Take him.
Saga!
Take Emil!
Saga, take Emil!
Put him down! Take Emil!
He killed Hans.
Saga, take Emil! Take Emil!
Saga, dammit!
Saga, take Emil!
Come on!
Come on!
Let go. Let go now. Move. We have them.
Were you really going to let him die?
Saga.
Yeah, I shot them. I was forced to.
I didn't know any of them.
- Except Morten, once.
- Okay.
Then we have these.
My works.
I tried to get his attention.
Freddie's?
But no one understood. Not you, either.
I had to help you.
I had 172 pills... all sorts that I was
just about to take when he came.
- When who came?
- My half-brother. Morten.
His mom felt guilty because he
went crazy in Afghanistan.
- His mother, Helle Anker?
- She wanted to tell him who he really was.
Give him a code.
Wanted to tell him about his roots.
I wasn't really listening, but...
But he said a thing...
He said: "Why should I suffer -"
when those who are responsible
for my suffering don't?"
Okay.
And it was these people who were
responsible for your suffering.
The Johanssons we know a bit about.
Hans Pettersson drove you
back when you ran away.
That's when I ended up in the cellar.
- Have you seen the cellar?
- Yeah.
Then there's Lars-Ove Abrahamsson.
He molested you.
He molested me for four years.
Yeah. And Håkan Ekdahl placed
you at the Johanssons'.
Placed me and forced me to stay.
Then there's these two.
Freddie Holst. Helle Anker. Why them?
My creators.
They're your creators. Yeah.
But why just them, Emil?
Can you remember your mother?
Yes.
- How was she?
- She loved me.
So if she hadn't died, you would
have been fine.
She just collapsed in the kitchen
while making lunch for me.
That wasn't Freddie Holst's fault.
- Why are we talking about this?
- Weren't there any grandparents or other family to take care of you?
Do you think that's why?
You think I punished him because
he was absent in my childhood.
- Didn't you?
- I didn't punish anyone. The others...
They didn't take their responsibility.
It was justice. There was no punishment.
Do you understand the difference?
And Freddie Holst? Helle Anker?
- Consequences.
- I don't understand.
They...
There was a way to avoid all this.
All the pain. All the fear. All the death.
And what is that?
I should never have been born.
I don't know how much you know,
but here he is. He was rescued.
Do you want to hold him?
No.
I have no desire to see him.
I can take him.
I'll be there shortly.
The receipt for the payment.
I've put in a little extra.
I'm truly sorry for everything
that's happened. I mean that.
Yeah. Thanks.
I've printed your interrogation.
You need to sign it.
- You still don't want to have a lawyer?
- No.
You knew Hans Pettersson.
Yes.
You liked him.
Yes.
Did he like you?
- Yes.
- So you were friends.
Why did you save me, then?
I'm police.
You wanted to die.
I didn't want to die.
I wanted to never have been born.
It's not really the same thing.
Do you understand?
No, you don't understand.
You had a friend who needed you. Pen.
As you know, Annika Melander has been
cleared, and we let Claes Sandberg go.
Did he choose to be happy?
- Thank you for your time.
- Thank you.
- Has Lillian contacted you?
- Yeah, I'm going over there now.
Good.
Good work. Truly. Thank you.
- Hans' funeral is tomorrow.
- Yeah, I know.
- Have you been to a funeral?
- I've been to a few. Haven't you?
No.
What about your sister?
I didn't go to her funeral. I couldn't.
- But you're going Hans' tomorrow?
- Will you come with me?
- Do you want me to?
- Yes.
Then I will.
- See you tomorrow.
- Yeah.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- What's this about?
- Let's take it inside.
Thanks.
- Do you want anything?
- No, thanks.
- Can we sit down?
- Yeah, of course.
A couple weeks ago a skeleton was
dug up in Sweden. Under a road...
Okay, that's enough.
I'd like to just have a few days off.
Can't you give it to someone else?
They estimate that they've been
in the ground for five to six years.
They've managed to identify
her with the help of DNA.
- It's Alice.
- No.
It isn't.
No. It isn't.
- I'm so sorry.
- It isn't.
- We'll do everything we can...
- Hello! They're wrong, I'm telling you.
And you're wrong.
Where did my girls go?
They fucking were together. So where
did they go if they were with her?
- We don't know, Henrik.
- Where was she found?
Okay, good. We're going there. Come.
- Did they stop looking?
- They've dug everywhere.
- They aren't here, Henrik.
- They should be.
You dig for victims in different places.
There is a distance between them.
And that they haven't found them
could mean that they're alive.
I know. That's almost worse.
I know that you're alone.
But it was a totally ordinary day.
I went to work...
And your mother, she...
Your mother, she...
When someone takes the life
of someone we love -
- it's easy for the heart to
become full of darkness.
To wish that person harm.
Anger replaces sorrow -
- and displaces the bright
memories we have of Hans -
- and that we really need.
Hans would not have wanted that.
He always tried, despite the work he did -
- to see the good in every person.
You gave him life.
Receive him in your peace.
And give him, for Jesus Christ's sake,
a joyful resurrection.
Bye.
Saga.
- How are you?
- Henrik didn't come.
Oh... I thought you'd talked to him.
About what?
Henrik Sabroe. I can't take your call right
now. Leave a name and phone number.
They found Alice.
I've obviously thought that
they could be dead.
But I thought they were together.
So whatever happened to them,
they had each other.
Now they're without their mother.
How will they manage?
Are you using drugs?
Stimulants?
And sleeping pills to relax?
How long have you been addicted?
Since they disappeared.
- Have you been on them while we've worked together?
- The whole time.
- That's serious misconduct. Criminal.
- And one must report such things.
Right?
Do you remember what we talked about...
why I don't let people close to me?
Yeah.
Do you remember why?
Because everyone, in one way or
another, has left you or hurt you.
You're here?
How was the funeral?
I don't know. I don't have
much to compare it to.
I thought you'd take the day off.
No, I need to close the case with Emil
and verify the reports.
Emil is dead.
He killed himself in his cell.
- How?
- He cut his wrist.
Someone said he took a paper clip.
Is everything okay?
No. He took the paper clip from me.
I don't know if he took
it, or if I left it.
Follow me.
There was another thing
I needed to tell you.
As you know, Kjell Grankvist has given
his inquiry over to the prosecutor.
Yes.
I don't think you did
anything to your mom -
- but one can't ignore the
technical evidence there is.
- Are they starting an investigation?
- Only you and I know, and it doesn't need to be more than that.
But I'm innocent. I hoped
that would be enough.
But if I'm going to be investigated,
then I'll be removed from my duties.
I'm very sorry.
I had a motive, no alibi -
- and they have technical evidence.
I'm going to be sentenced!
Let's not anticipate things.
Saga.
Saga!
Why? I can't give you permission to
look for them on your own.
- Can't you give me a leave of absence?
- No.
Okay. I quit. I'll send
something to you in writing.
John? Is Saga here?
You haven't heard?
Heard what?
Saga, it's me!
Saga!
Saga.
Hey, Wiki.
What are you doing here again?
I quit.
I really like my job.
It's not like with you, but
I like being an investigator.
But that's not all I am.
I was first Alice's husband, and
I was a father to two girls.
And that was taken from me.
And now you think everything has been
taken from you? You know what? Fuck that.
Because you're not just going to give up.
Saga, I really need you.
You won't give up, because I know we
can find my daughters. You and me. Okay?
- Stay there!
- Saga...
Stay there!
- Don't do it!
- Stay there!
Saga.
Saga! Do you hear what I'm telling you?
I need you!
Saga!
Look at this.
A car was stolen the morning they
disappeared. Ten minutes from our house.
Are you coming?
- It's a six-year-old car theft.
- Is that it?
Even if we find it, the chance that
it will lead to anything is minimal.
Yeah. I know that.
But I have nothing else to do. Do you?
No.
