1
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:26,057
You're all that's left of us.

2
00:02:26,098 --> 00:02:29,924
Good luck.
God bless.

3
00:02:29,963 --> 00:02:32,562
And Godspeed.

4
00:05:23,668 --> 00:05:25,995
Bower.

5
00:05:50,362 --> 00:05:52,060
Bower.

6
00:06:13,769 --> 00:06:17,324
"In the event
of mild memory loss

7
00:06:17,365 --> 00:06:22,060
resulting from
extended hypersleep..."

8
00:06:54,098 --> 00:06:56,115
Lieutenant!

9
00:06:57,134 --> 00:06:58,893
Lieutenant Payton!

10
00:08:16,723 --> 00:08:19,322
Hey. Hey.

11
00:08:27,134 --> 00:08:29,651
-Who are you?
-I'm Bower.

12
00:08:29,692 --> 00:08:32,129
Corporal Bower, sir.

13
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,717
Bower?
Bower?

14
00:08:34,768 --> 00:08:37,253
You're waking
from extended hypersleep.

15
00:08:37,293 --> 00:08:40,091
-Bower?
-This is disorientation.

16
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:42,188
Could you get that
fucking light out of my eyes?

17
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:43,528
Sorry, sir.

18
00:08:45,395 --> 00:08:46,984
Where are we?

19
00:08:47,033 --> 00:08:49,022
Aboard the Elysium.

20
00:08:50,561 --> 00:08:53,028
The Elysium?

21
00:08:53,058 --> 00:08:55,966
Where are we?

22
00:08:55,995 --> 00:08:58,253
I don't know.

23
00:08:58,293 --> 00:09:00,630
Where's the rest of the crew?

24
00:09:02,328 --> 00:09:03,918
Is it our shift?

25
00:09:03,967 --> 00:09:06,724
-Our rotation?
-I believe so.

26
00:09:06,764 --> 00:09:08,892
Aren't they supposed
to be here to wake us up?

27
00:09:08,932 --> 00:09:10,759
I don't know.

28
00:09:15,066 --> 00:09:17,322
Hit the lights, will you?

29
00:09:19,131 --> 00:09:21,719
There's a problem
with the power, sir.

30
00:09:24,767 --> 00:09:26,355
Who woke you up?

31
00:09:26,394 --> 00:09:28,692
It had to have been
the flight computer.

32
00:09:28,732 --> 00:09:31,321
There's no one here
except us.

33
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,846
It's cold.

34
00:09:33,897 --> 00:09:36,913
I've been awake for over an hour
and I still can't remember anything.

35
00:09:39,061 --> 00:09:41,528
The last time I crawled out
of a hyperbunk

36
00:09:41,558 --> 00:09:44,226
it took me quite a while
to get it all back.

37
00:09:44,267 --> 00:09:46,724
What was your...

38
00:09:46,764 --> 00:09:48,692
what was your last flight, sir?

39
00:09:48,732 --> 00:09:50,691
I don't know.

40
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:52,698
Sir, do you even know
where we're going?

41
00:09:52,729 --> 00:09:55,596
I remember the training,

42
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:58,961
but not the destination,
the mission.

43
00:09:58,991 --> 00:10:01,188
I figured you'd tell me.

44
00:10:01,229 --> 00:10:02,717
If this really is our ship,

45
00:10:02,758 --> 00:10:04,855
then this room should
be locked into position

46
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:07,982
and behind that door
should be the bridge.

47
00:10:08,033 --> 00:10:10,191
Jesus.

48
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:12,288
Somebody was trying to get out.

49
00:10:18,092 --> 00:10:20,529
Lieutenant.

50
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:22,998
None of the activators are working.

51
00:10:23,028 --> 00:10:24,326
Yeah, it figures.

52
00:10:25,764 --> 00:10:27,883
Without unified threading
we can't connect.

53
00:10:27,932 --> 00:10:29,691
Hold on here.

54
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:32,129
We can at least
get this station to work.

55
00:10:41,928 --> 00:10:44,395
I didn't even think of that.

56
00:10:46,724 --> 00:10:49,162
All right. Jesus.

57
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:55,216
Lieutenant Payton on the com.
Anybody copy?

58
00:10:57,232 --> 00:11:00,519
This is Lieutenant Payton
of flight team...

59
00:11:02,197 --> 00:11:04,355
Shit.

60
00:11:04,395 --> 00:11:06,413
-5
-5.
-How do you know that?

61
00:11:11,259 --> 00:11:13,886
This is Lieutenant Payton
of flight team 5.

62
00:11:13,927 --> 00:11:16,154
Anybody copy?

63
00:11:16,195 --> 00:11:19,130
Anyone respond.

64
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:22,658
This is Lieutenant Payton
of flight team 5.

65
00:11:22,697 --> 00:11:24,784
Anybody awake up there?

66
00:11:24,825 --> 00:11:27,423
Team 4 is supposed
to be here for flight rotation.

67
00:11:27,462 --> 00:11:29,150
Where could they be?

68
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:32,687
Maybe they couldn't get to us.

69
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:38,062
Where did he go?

70
00:11:46,364 --> 00:11:50,520
Power systems must be free floating
between uncoupled circuits,

71
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:53,216
or something the override grid
won't even lock in.

72
00:11:53,256 --> 00:11:54,745
What do you think?

73
00:11:58,561 --> 00:12:00,220
Somebody's up there.

74
00:12:02,797 --> 00:12:05,554
Uh, it's ventilation.

75
00:12:05,595 --> 00:12:08,081
The system keeps rebooting
after each surge.

76
00:12:08,131 --> 00:12:09,421
That could be anything.

77
00:12:09,461 --> 00:12:13,397
Listen, I think we should
get out of here.

78
00:12:13,427 --> 00:12:16,585
I'd rather be up and out
than stuck in the trunk, wouldn't you?

79
00:12:17,692 --> 00:12:18,889
Test test.
Test test.

80
00:12:18,929 --> 00:12:21,327
Copy.

81
00:12:24,865 --> 00:12:26,053
Lift me up.

82
00:12:33,126 --> 00:12:34,926
Our 2nd lieutenant must
have come through here.

83
00:12:34,966 --> 00:12:37,153
It's the only way.

84
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,888
It's fucking dark in here.

85
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:43,895
Don't worry.
Just take the first way out.

86
00:12:43,926 --> 00:12:47,121
I'll guide you back here to open
the doors from the outside.

87
00:12:51,198 --> 00:12:53,057
How are we doing?

88
00:12:53,096 --> 00:12:54,884
See anything?

89
00:12:54,924 --> 00:12:56,553
Nothing yet.

90
00:12:56,594 --> 00:12:59,529
Not a single vent opening
or anything.

91
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:02,288
What about on your end?

92
00:13:03,796 --> 00:13:07,163
Power surges keep happening
in longer increments just like you said.

93
00:13:07,192 --> 00:13:09,591
Reactor timing is offset in the core.

94
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:13,456
It's trying to reconnect.

95
00:13:13,496 --> 00:13:15,394
But it won't until it's reset.

96
00:13:15,423 --> 00:13:17,523
How do you know that?

97
00:13:19,429 --> 00:13:22,517
I don't know.
I can't even remember my... Jesus Christ!

98
00:13:25,463 --> 00:13:28,760
But I know everything there is
to know about that damn reactor.

99
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:31,588
That's the training talking.

100
00:13:31,629 --> 00:13:33,216
You must be our technical engineer.

101
00:13:40,928 --> 00:13:42,517
Found an intersection.

102
00:13:42,556 --> 00:13:44,994
Copy that.
Anything look promising?

103
00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:47,721
A whole lot of the same...
nothing.

104
00:14:01,057 --> 00:14:03,586
-Taking a left. Make a note.
-Left it is.

105
00:14:19,889 --> 00:14:21,327
Payton.

106
00:14:28,461 --> 00:14:30,889
Payton!
Payton, do you copy?

107
00:14:30,928 --> 00:14:33,655
I don't know if I'm going in circles.

108
00:14:34,825 --> 00:14:38,161
And, um, I can't breathe.

109
00:14:38,191 --> 00:14:41,417
Payton, do you copy?

110
00:14:41,456 --> 00:14:43,355
I'm here. I'm here.

111
00:14:44,923 --> 00:14:47,921
Easy now, easy. Breathe.
Just listen to me.

112
00:14:47,961 --> 00:14:50,479
-I just want to stand up.
-Calm down.

113
00:14:50,528 --> 00:14:53,216
-I can't breathe.
-Stop it and listen to me.

114
00:14:53,255 --> 00:14:55,384
-Now let's just get you back here.
-Back?

115
00:14:55,423 --> 00:14:58,860
Are you fucking kidding me?
I can't even turn around.

116
00:14:58,889 --> 00:15:01,378
Do you know
how far I've gone, Payton?

117
00:15:01,427 --> 00:15:04,184
-Listen to me.
-I just want out of this fucking thing!

118
00:15:04,225 --> 00:15:07,421
Put your mind somewhere else.

119
00:15:07,461 --> 00:15:10,149
Like where?

120
00:15:10,198 --> 00:15:12,287
This may not be
the best time to tell you,

121
00:15:12,326 --> 00:15:13,985
but I got the door open.

122
00:15:16,293 --> 00:15:18,620
You fucking kidding me?

123
00:15:18,659 --> 00:15:21,596
Yeah, I'm kidding you.

124
00:15:24,963 --> 00:15:27,552
You see?
Now that's not so bad.

125
00:15:27,591 --> 00:15:30,578
We're gonna get you through this.
We're gonna figure this out together.

126
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:32,645
-You hear me?
-Uh-huh.

127
00:15:32,696 --> 00:15:34,455
You spent eight years
in the hyperbunk.

128
00:15:34,495 --> 00:15:36,751
A couple of more minutes
in a shaft won't kill you.

129
00:15:36,792 --> 00:15:37,990
Eight years?

130
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:41,147
I do remember two years
being our duty rotation.

131
00:15:41,197 --> 00:15:44,783
If we're team 5, that means
we've been out for eight years.

132
00:15:44,823 --> 00:15:47,351
I don't think
you're here by default.

133
00:15:47,392 --> 00:15:50,418
You were a select pick.
We all were.

134
00:15:50,459 --> 00:15:52,927
This was something special.

135
00:15:54,894 --> 00:15:56,193
Someone's been through here.

136
00:15:58,331 --> 00:16:00,587
-Wait a second.
-What's wrong?

137
00:16:02,596 --> 00:16:05,523
I'm at an angle.
Oh shit, I'm at an angle.

138
00:16:05,562 --> 00:16:06,851
I'm at an angle!

139
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:13,395
Bower, what happened?

140
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:20,217
What is it?

141
00:16:20,258 --> 00:16:23,196
Bower, are you hurt?

142
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:33,754
Bower, what happened?

143
00:16:36,222 --> 00:16:38,321
I can hear you breathing.
Are you all right?

144
00:17:12,395 --> 00:17:14,913
Can you hear me?

145
00:17:22,195 --> 00:17:25,751
Bower, are you all right?

146
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:30,117
I've... I've found Cooper.

147
00:17:30,157 --> 00:17:33,125
He's dead.
I'm in a boot locker.

148
00:17:36,991 --> 00:17:39,220
Bower?

149
00:17:41,096 --> 00:17:42,256
You all right?

150
00:17:47,031 --> 00:17:50,219
Make that an overhead compartment.

151
00:17:50,259 --> 00:17:52,785
Payton, I got out.

152
00:17:54,792 --> 00:17:58,349
Payton?

153
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:00,326
Bower, do you hear me?

154
00:18:00,356 --> 00:18:02,296
Do you read?

155
00:18:15,492 --> 00:18:17,521
Payton, are you there?

156
00:18:17,561 --> 00:18:19,856
Payton, can you hear me?

157
00:18:39,329 --> 00:18:41,416
Payton, do you copy?

158
00:18:44,564 --> 00:18:46,891
Payton?

159
00:18:46,931 --> 00:18:49,357
Corporal, can you hear me?

160
00:18:51,726 --> 00:18:53,624
Corporal, can you hear me?

161
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:19,058
Hey.

162
00:19:19,088 --> 00:19:21,615
Hey, I need to talk to you!

163
00:19:21,655 --> 00:19:23,753
Wait! Stop!

164
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:32,256
Don't run again, okay?

165
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:35,282
I don't care if you were
stealing or anything.

166
00:19:37,891 --> 00:19:40,218
I just want to ask you
a couple questions.

167
00:19:43,153 --> 00:19:45,491
How are you awake?

168
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,345
Hello?

169
00:19:53,794 --> 00:19:55,852
Hello!

170
00:19:55,892 --> 00:19:58,450
What, are you fucking deaf?

171
00:20:02,724 --> 00:20:03,983
Hello?

172
00:20:05,422 --> 00:20:07,391
Jesus!

173
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:40,317
What?

174
00:20:44,222 --> 00:20:45,810
Don't move.

175
00:20:47,029 --> 00:20:50,856
Wait. Wait a second.
I'm with the flight crew.

176
00:20:53,493 --> 00:20:55,123
Don't you move.

177
00:20:55,163 --> 00:20:57,450
Really, I'm part of the flight crew.

178
00:21:00,087 --> 00:21:02,115
-Take them off.
-What?

179
00:21:02,154 --> 00:21:04,422
Shoes.

180
00:21:04,461 --> 00:21:06,859
I'll gut your ass.

181
00:22:34,063 --> 00:22:35,391
What the?

182
00:23:22,452 --> 00:23:24,051
Bower, do you read?

183
00:23:53,292 --> 00:23:55,121
God damn it, answer me.

184
00:24:07,659 --> 00:24:09,457
Bower, do you hear me?

185
00:24:10,756 --> 00:24:12,854
Do you read?

186
00:24:14,362 --> 00:24:15,951
You are not hearing me.

187
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:19,047
There's no procedure for this.
They can't write a book for this.

188
00:24:19,086 --> 00:24:21,555
After what I just saw, procedure
just went out the fucking window.

189
00:24:21,595 --> 00:24:23,551
Listen, I need you to calm down.

190
00:24:23,592 --> 00:24:26,150
You're all we've got out there
if we're gonna figure this out.

191
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:28,416
Let's get back to these...
these other guys.

192
00:24:28,457 --> 00:24:31,683
Guys?
Those weren't guys.

193
00:24:31,723 --> 00:24:34,192
They were hunting.

194
00:24:34,221 --> 00:24:37,588
They... they took Cooper's body.

195
00:24:37,628 --> 00:24:40,355
Just like a fucking pack of...

196
00:24:41,954 --> 00:24:44,622
They didn't seem human.

197
00:24:44,662 --> 00:24:48,106
We have to try
and contact the bridge.

198
00:24:48,156 --> 00:24:51,614
You're assuming that there
is someone on the bridge.

199
00:24:51,653 --> 00:24:53,951
There has to be.

200
00:24:53,991 --> 00:24:55,579
We can't be alone in this.

201
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:57,679
Well, alone or not,

202
00:24:57,729 --> 00:25:00,215
we can't assume help will be coming.

203
00:25:01,894 --> 00:25:05,849
Out here there is no rescue
and there is no turning around.

204
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:09,086
I don't think this thing
was even built to return.

205
00:25:09,126 --> 00:25:10,556
What are you talking about?

206
00:25:10,596 --> 00:25:13,551
I'm saying that this
is no ordinary transport.

207
00:25:13,592 --> 00:25:15,990
We're not out on the belt
collecting data.

208
00:25:16,019 --> 00:25:18,616
We're not hauling cargo.

209
00:25:18,656 --> 00:25:21,713
We are the cargo.

210
00:25:22,791 --> 00:25:26,378
60,000 people
on a single launch trajectory.

211
00:25:26,419 --> 00:25:28,856
Tanis.

212
00:25:28,886 --> 00:25:31,513
25 billion people watched in awe.

213
00:25:31,554 --> 00:25:34,422
These breathtaking images
of Tanis arrived

214
00:25:34,461 --> 00:25:37,189
from the Popolous probe and were
broadcast yesterday.

215
00:25:37,229 --> 00:25:39,626
These were taken as the probe
was entering the orbit

216
00:25:39,656 --> 00:25:42,284
of the only Earth like planet
known to exist.

217
00:25:42,323 --> 00:25:45,808
People of the whole world are watching
as the probe sent into space

218
00:25:45,858 --> 00:25:50,384
is transferring data exceeding
even the most optimistic expectations.

219
00:25:50,424 --> 00:25:52,853
We knew to expect water on Tanis.

220
00:25:52,893 --> 00:25:55,151
We knew to expect
reasonable temperatures.

221
00:25:55,191 --> 00:25:56,919
But the questioned remained...

222
00:25:56,959 --> 00:26:00,615
will this planet meet the extremely
complex and unlikely combination

223
00:26:00,655 --> 00:26:04,021
of parameters to support life
as we know it?

224
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:06,818
The probe has touched down
on the planet six days ago.

225
00:26:06,858 --> 00:26:08,915
It's sending off its first transmission

226
00:26:08,955 --> 00:26:11,923
that is expected
to arrive any second now.

227
00:26:23,721 --> 00:26:25,949
Ladies and gentlemen,

228
00:26:25,989 --> 00:26:29,445
this is an unprecedented
moment for all mankind.

229
00:26:29,486 --> 00:26:31,953
Are we seeing this?

230
00:26:31,993 --> 00:26:34,182
First detection as we had hoped.

231
00:26:34,221 --> 00:26:36,449
This needs to be verified,
but it appears

232
00:26:36,489 --> 00:26:39,256
some form of plant life is present.

233
00:26:39,286 --> 00:26:42,951
My God, life on Tanis.
There is life detection.

234
00:26:42,991 --> 00:26:45,079
We have habitat detection.

235
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:48,176
Verified, this is a monumental
day for all of us.

236
00:26:48,227 --> 00:26:51,314
Only a matter of time before
we send people out there.

237
00:26:51,354 --> 00:26:53,511
Processing and population.

238
00:26:53,561 --> 00:26:55,349
We're a settlers vessel.

239
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:57,478
Elysium was a one-way ticket.

240
00:26:59,457 --> 00:27:01,424
How could I have...

241
00:27:01,454 --> 00:27:02,853
left her?

242
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,347
How could I have done that?

243
00:27:09,155 --> 00:27:10,673
I loved her.

244
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,489
We've got to get to the bridge.

245
00:27:16,519 --> 00:27:20,115
We've got to get control of the ship
before these guys rip it apart.

246
00:27:20,155 --> 00:27:21,683
This is too fucking important.

247
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:24,421
-Payton, where is your wife?
-What?

248
00:27:24,461 --> 00:27:26,978
Do you remember the recruitment?
The breeding tests,

249
00:27:27,028 --> 00:27:28,686
the husbands, the wives?

250
00:27:28,727 --> 00:27:32,481
We didn't leave them behind.
They're here somewhere onboard.

251
00:27:55,589 --> 00:27:58,457
I've got to find her before
these fucking animals do.

252
00:27:58,487 --> 00:28:00,713
Try to think.
Where would they be?

253
00:28:00,753 --> 00:28:02,882
A sleeping compartment
for non-service personnel?

254
00:28:02,922 --> 00:28:04,720
Wait, hold on.
Think for a second.

255
00:28:04,759 --> 00:28:06,718
I remember there were thousands
of passengers that weren't part

256
00:28:06,758 --> 00:28:09,275
-of the development team. Families.
-You listen to me.

257
00:28:09,325 --> 00:28:12,682
You know how big this ship is?
And you have no idea where your wife...

258
00:28:12,721 --> 00:28:15,749
where our wives might be.

259
00:28:15,788 --> 00:28:18,277
If you go off on some
wild goose chase

260
00:28:18,326 --> 00:28:22,413
we're gonna be no closer to getting
ourselves out of this situation

261
00:28:22,452 --> 00:28:25,390
and with even less time
to regain control of the ship.

262
00:28:25,419 --> 00:28:29,585
Once we've taken control of the systems,
finding them will be easy.

263
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:31,522
Are you hearing me?

264
00:28:32,791 --> 00:28:35,878
We save the ship,
we save them.

265
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,617
-Security locker.
-What?

266
00:28:50,993 --> 00:28:53,451
Non-lethal antiriot guns.

267
00:28:53,491 --> 00:28:56,147
Close up they'll do some damage.

268
00:29:25,887 --> 00:29:28,145
All right, I'm gonna lay out
a path for you

269
00:29:28,185 --> 00:29:30,913
and try to bypass
the main security grids.

270
00:29:30,952 --> 00:29:34,480
Without main power
we'll never get these doors open.

271
00:29:34,519 --> 00:29:37,547
Listen, if you can get me
to the reactor bay

272
00:29:37,586 --> 00:29:40,184
I can reset the cycle manually.

273
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:42,212
You know how to do that?

274
00:29:42,252 --> 00:29:45,088
-Yeah.
-It's a long way.

275
00:29:45,118 --> 00:29:48,017
Gonna have to get you past
a few security bulkheads.

276
00:29:48,056 --> 00:29:50,383
With a little sidestepping,
we're gonna get you there.

277
00:29:54,818 --> 00:29:57,915
Oh, for Christ's sake.
Delta 81643 Lima.

278
00:29:57,955 --> 00:29:59,384
Okay okay, hold on.

279
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:01,613
I don't want you going too far.
Just catch your breath.

280
00:30:01,653 --> 00:30:03,621
I don't need a rest.
Just tell me which way.

281
00:30:03,661 --> 00:30:05,847
I don't know yet.
Hold on.

282
00:30:15,259 --> 00:30:17,117
Payton.

283
00:30:21,593 --> 00:30:25,488
Pandorum, you ever
felt the symptoms?

284
00:30:26,926 --> 00:30:29,285
Of all the things to remember,
why would you pick that?

285
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:34,949
Were you thinking
of the Eden mission?

286
00:30:34,989 --> 00:30:36,917
What about the Eden?

287
00:30:38,855 --> 00:30:43,122
You just had to remind me of the biggest
fucking catastrophe in space travel.

288
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:47,046
The flight cautionary tale from hell.

289
00:30:47,086 --> 00:30:49,554
I remember.
Didn't they have some kind of

290
00:30:49,584 --> 00:30:53,020
hypersleep malfunction?

291
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:56,107
Two years into their shift
one of their officers

292
00:30:56,157 --> 00:30:58,516
had a psychological breakdown.

293
00:30:58,556 --> 00:31:01,853
The doctors refer
to it as ODS syndrome.

294
00:31:01,893 --> 00:31:05,748
But the pilots,
we call it pandorum.

295
00:31:06,957 --> 00:31:10,653
It drove him insane. He became
convinced the flight was cursed.

296
00:31:12,021 --> 00:31:14,078
-Evil.
-What did he do?

297
00:31:15,788 --> 00:31:17,945
He evacuated the ship.

298
00:31:20,952 --> 00:31:24,349
He launched them all
into oblivion.

299
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:27,516
5,000 people sent to their death

300
00:31:27,556 --> 00:31:29,413
with one push of a button.

301
00:31:32,621 --> 00:31:35,419
At least we didn't wake up
floating away in a coffin.

302
00:31:37,855 --> 00:31:40,015
Who says we didn't?

303
00:31:50,153 --> 00:31:52,621
-Which way?
-Left at the third marker.

304
00:31:52,651 --> 00:31:55,647
Just two more levels up
and we're on the main walkway.

305
00:31:55,688 --> 00:31:57,156
Should be easy from there.

306
00:32:07,226 --> 00:32:09,344
This can't be right.

307
00:32:09,384 --> 00:32:11,651
What's not right?

308
00:32:11,691 --> 00:32:14,749
I don't know if I'm hallucinating.

309
00:32:16,386 --> 00:32:18,474
What?
What's going on?

310
00:32:18,525 --> 00:32:21,282
I've seen this before.
This is a...

311
00:32:28,825 --> 00:32:30,583
this...

312
00:32:30,623 --> 00:32:33,111
this is a different one.

313
00:32:40,123 --> 00:32:41,951
It's booby-trapped.

314
00:32:41,991 --> 00:32:44,079
Rigged the ceiling.

315
00:32:44,119 --> 00:32:45,557
Be careful.

316
00:32:48,624 --> 00:32:50,981
No! No!

317
00:32:51,021 --> 00:32:53,039
No!

318
00:32:53,089 --> 00:32:54,449
Quiet!

319
00:32:56,717 --> 00:32:59,345
Quiet! Shh.

320
00:32:59,384 --> 00:33:01,721
We have to shut the hell up.
Do you understand?

321
00:33:01,751 --> 00:33:04,239
I'm gonna get you out of this,
but you have to be quiet.

322
00:33:04,288 --> 00:33:06,346
You understand?

323
00:33:09,222 --> 00:33:11,342
Bower, you sure this is a good idea?

324
00:33:14,588 --> 00:33:17,056
Watch yourself.

325
00:33:21,321 --> 00:33:22,911
He's team 6.

326
00:33:22,951 --> 00:33:26,576
That's the shift unit
that's supposed to follow us.

327
00:33:26,615 --> 00:33:28,884
He could be...

328
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:30,542
Quiet. Quiet!

329
00:33:30,593 --> 00:33:33,709
Easy. I'm not gonna hurt you
but you have to be quiet.

330
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:36,156
Do you hear me?

331
00:33:38,884 --> 00:33:41,980
Shepard, team 6, sir.

332
00:33:43,289 --> 00:33:45,548
I believe I'm the only one.

333
00:33:45,587 --> 00:33:48,244
I knew it.
I knew you'd come back.

334
00:33:48,285 --> 00:33:50,482
-What?
-Where's your squad?

335
00:33:50,521 --> 00:33:53,279
Squad?
This is my lieutenant.

336
00:33:53,319 --> 00:33:55,917
-Where's your shuttle?
-Shuttle? What are you talking about?

337
00:33:55,957 --> 00:33:57,746
You're the retraction crew, right?

338
00:33:57,786 --> 00:34:00,912
No. No.
I'm team 5.

339
00:34:00,951 --> 00:34:03,979
-You just woke up?
-Six or eight hours ago.

340
00:34:04,019 --> 00:34:05,278
So you don't know
what the fuck is going on?

341
00:34:05,317 --> 00:34:06,715
That's what I'm saying.

342
00:34:06,756 --> 00:34:09,722
-You know as much as me, man.
-I don't know anything.

343
00:34:09,753 --> 00:34:12,809
You, you're gonna fit right in.

344
00:34:15,257 --> 00:34:16,655
What are you doing?

345
00:34:16,686 --> 00:34:18,014
-Get the scent off.
-Scent?

346
00:34:18,054 --> 00:34:19,952
They're fast and they're fucking
stronger than you know.

347
00:34:19,983 --> 00:34:23,250
They come after you, you run.
You run and you don't fucking look back.

348
00:34:23,289 --> 00:34:24,918
I can't wait for you.

349
00:34:24,958 --> 00:34:27,974
Who... who are they?

350
00:34:28,023 --> 00:34:29,643
-I can't help you.
-Help me.

351
00:34:29,681 --> 00:34:32,650
Bower, you tell that asshole
the chain of command

352
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:35,086
-and a direct order is being made.
-You're still an officer on this ship,

353
00:34:35,117 --> 00:34:37,275
and at the current time
your CO is ordering you...

354
00:34:37,324 --> 00:34:39,483
-Ordering me? That's funny.
...now is ordering you...

355
00:34:39,523 --> 00:34:41,422
You're late.
There's no fucking CO on this ship.

356
00:34:41,452 --> 00:34:42,750
Fuck you.

357
00:34:58,483 --> 00:34:59,583
That's not gonna save you.

358
00:35:06,186 --> 00:35:07,773
Get the hell out of there.

359
00:35:09,523 --> 00:35:11,380
Get out of there!

360
00:36:16,585 --> 00:36:17,954
Just run.
Go!

361
00:37:32,389 --> 00:37:33,847
I don't understand.

362
00:37:54,987 --> 00:37:56,974
Thanks.

363
00:38:07,155 --> 00:38:09,451
l... I don't understand.

364
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:14,646
I don't know what you're saying.

365
00:38:14,686 --> 00:38:17,204
l... I don't understand.

366
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,577
Agriculture.

367
00:38:23,617 --> 00:38:25,206
You're with agriculture.

368
00:38:27,454 --> 00:38:29,851
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm with the flight crew.

369
00:38:29,882 --> 00:38:33,248
But I don't know...
I don't know what happened.

370
00:38:34,757 --> 00:38:37,722
Yeah, I know that,
but I'm not in charge here.

371
00:38:37,753 --> 00:38:40,240
I'm trying to find out
what happened to the ship.

372
00:38:40,291 --> 00:38:42,579
S-ship.

373
00:38:42,619 --> 00:38:44,376
Ship.

374
00:38:44,416 --> 00:38:47,014
I'm on my way to the reactor.

375
00:38:47,054 --> 00:38:48,742
Reactor.

376
00:38:48,782 --> 00:38:50,809
Reactor, that's right.
Exactly right.

377
00:38:50,849 --> 00:38:53,648
But that doesn't concern you.
You stay here.

378
00:38:53,688 --> 00:38:58,123
You stay put and wait for the...

379
00:38:59,782 --> 00:39:02,748
security to reengage.

380
00:39:02,789 --> 00:39:06,545
And I'm gonna handle this problem.

381
00:39:06,585 --> 00:39:08,112
Okay?

382
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,887
God damn it.

383
00:39:45,856 --> 00:39:48,681
Who's there?

384
00:39:55,416 --> 00:39:58,282
Identify yourself.

385
00:39:58,322 --> 00:40:00,440
Bower?

386
00:40:00,489 --> 00:40:03,077
Is that you, Bower?

387
00:40:05,585 --> 00:40:07,574
That can't be you.

388
00:41:30,949 --> 00:41:32,646
You again.

389
00:42:00,849 --> 00:42:04,646
I understand that it's felt

390
00:42:04,686 --> 00:42:07,083
like every man for himself.

391
00:42:07,123 --> 00:42:10,978
If we're going to get out of this...

392
00:42:11,018 --> 00:42:15,175
a little fucking solidarity

393
00:42:15,215 --> 00:42:17,681
goes a long way.

394
00:42:21,648 --> 00:42:23,617
We all want to survive,

395
00:42:23,657 --> 00:42:26,014
right?

396
00:42:26,054 --> 00:42:28,481
I lost contact with my CO.

397
00:42:28,521 --> 00:42:31,347
So I need someone to tell me
how to get to the reactor.

398
00:42:34,755 --> 00:42:37,112
You know?
That's great.

399
00:42:37,152 --> 00:42:40,019
All right, we can work together

400
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:42,318
as a team.

401
00:42:51,748 --> 00:42:53,516
Go.

402
00:43:02,588 --> 00:43:04,016
Yeah.

403
00:43:11,148 --> 00:43:13,306
Yeah well, no sympathy here, pal.

404
00:43:13,346 --> 00:43:15,574
She left me with
a few sore spots too.

405
00:43:17,922 --> 00:43:19,940
Why the hell should I trust you?

406
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:23,746
-Listen, lady, we don't want any...
-Are you really part of the flight crew?

407
00:43:23,786 --> 00:43:26,543
Corporal Bower,
ship's mechanical engineer.

408
00:43:33,315 --> 00:43:36,043
I didn't think
there was any flight crew left.

409
00:43:37,483 --> 00:43:39,471
What's happened to us?

410
00:43:39,521 --> 00:43:41,847
A malfunction of some sort.

411
00:43:41,887 --> 00:43:45,284
You think?
What's your plan?

412
00:43:45,313 --> 00:43:47,871
Fire up the reactor.
Go from there.

413
00:43:47,922 --> 00:43:50,039
-You just wake up?
-Yeah.

414
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:52,916
-Just joined the party.
-You'll never make it.

415
00:43:52,945 --> 00:43:55,543
-Why is that?
-You're going the wrong direction.

416
00:43:57,382 --> 00:43:59,181
-Wait a second.
-Keep it down.

417
00:43:59,221 --> 00:44:01,148
-Who are you?
-Nobody.

418
00:44:01,188 --> 00:44:03,646
-I need you to show me the way.
-To the reactor?

419
00:44:03,686 --> 00:44:05,844
I don't like going that far down.

420
00:44:08,181 --> 00:44:10,338
No one ever comes back.

421
00:44:10,387 --> 00:44:13,614
We don't have much time.

422
00:44:13,655 --> 00:44:16,483
We could lose everything onboard.
Do you know what I'm saying to you?

423
00:44:16,512 --> 00:44:18,641
Can you fly it?

424
00:44:18,681 --> 00:44:21,547
Can you fly the ship?

425
00:44:21,588 --> 00:44:23,077
Land it if you have to?

426
00:44:25,614 --> 00:44:27,413
Yeah.

427
00:44:32,217 --> 00:44:34,045
How long have you been awake?

428
00:44:34,085 --> 00:44:37,101
Don't know.
There's no way to tell time in here.

429
00:44:37,152 --> 00:44:39,119
-Five, maybe six months.
-Months?

430
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:41,777
Quiet.
You want to get us killed?

431
00:44:45,784 --> 00:44:47,652
What are we doing?

432
00:44:47,681 --> 00:44:50,737
-We are waiting.
-Waiting for what?

433
00:44:53,445 --> 00:44:56,882
You want to get to the reactor?
Then trust me.

434
00:45:02,885 --> 00:45:06,512
Oh shit.
Hey, we have to go.

435
00:45:06,552 --> 00:45:08,110
Trust me.

436
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:10,277
We've got to go now.

437
00:45:10,318 --> 00:45:13,146
-We've got to go now.
-Wait.

438
00:45:13,186 --> 00:45:14,983
We've got to go now.

439
00:45:40,119 --> 00:45:41,976
What the hell are they?

440
00:45:42,016 --> 00:45:44,414
Never quite felt like sticking
around to find out.

441
00:45:44,454 --> 00:45:47,041
Running is always the best option.

442
00:45:47,081 --> 00:45:48,981
They can't be from this ship.

443
00:45:56,652 --> 00:45:58,210
What is all this?

444
00:45:58,250 --> 00:46:00,307
Ecological development.

445
00:46:00,347 --> 00:46:03,715
Embryonic charter, livestock
and wildlife repopulation.

446
00:46:03,755 --> 00:46:07,181
You live here?
You protect all this?

447
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,748
To us it seemed worth protecting.

448
00:46:10,788 --> 00:46:12,445
Us?

449
00:46:13,885 --> 00:46:16,242
When I woke up,
there were five if us.

450
00:46:17,550 --> 00:46:20,579
I was part of the Brandenburg Institute's
genetic sampling team.

451
00:46:20,619 --> 00:46:23,775
Seven years collecting
and readying earth's biosphere...

452
00:46:23,815 --> 00:46:26,842
just didn't feel right handing it off.

453
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:31,905
I volunteered to go along with it.

454
00:46:36,012 --> 00:46:38,809
This...

455
00:46:38,849 --> 00:46:41,007
truly is Noah's Ark.

456
00:46:41,047 --> 00:46:45,244
This archive holds the world
we are going to live in.

457
00:46:45,284 --> 00:46:49,050
We've already lost about
30% of the specimens.

458
00:46:50,148 --> 00:46:53,443
The lab has its own generator,
but without the reactor working,

459
00:46:53,483 --> 00:46:56,141
I don't know if they
will ever make it to Tanis.

460
00:46:56,181 --> 00:46:58,079
Tanis.

461
00:46:58,119 --> 00:47:00,608
You couldn't remember?

462
00:47:00,648 --> 00:47:02,706
I couldn't remember how...

463
00:47:02,746 --> 00:47:05,184
how far away it was.

464
00:47:05,213 --> 00:47:07,940
This was a 123-year flight.

465
00:47:07,981 --> 00:47:10,108
Consider yourself lucky.

466
00:47:10,148 --> 00:47:12,746
It took me months to recall.

467
00:47:12,786 --> 00:47:15,373
It took even longer to get
that goddamn door open.

468
00:47:15,413 --> 00:47:18,311
It comes on in pieces.

469
00:47:19,548 --> 00:47:22,416
I know everything about this vault
and its systems.

470
00:47:23,715 --> 00:47:26,152
But I still can't remember
where I grew up...

471
00:47:28,021 --> 00:47:30,108
or my brother's name.

472
00:47:30,148 --> 00:47:33,244
Are you hungry?

473
00:47:33,284 --> 00:47:35,273
Yeah, I'm starving.

474
00:47:39,349 --> 00:47:41,376
Here.

475
00:47:41,416 --> 00:47:43,815
Good for protein.

476
00:47:57,221 --> 00:48:00,307
How could we become like this
in only eight years?

477
00:48:00,347 --> 00:48:04,005
This ship was built to outlast
our children's children.

478
00:48:05,152 --> 00:48:08,980
I think we've been asleep
longer than you think.

479
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:39,309
You want in?

480
00:48:39,349 --> 00:48:40,648
Come and get it, you fuck!

481
00:48:52,943 --> 00:48:56,001
Help!
Help me!

482
00:48:58,079 --> 00:48:59,777
Help!

483
00:49:11,815 --> 00:49:14,373
Who the hell are you?

484
00:49:14,413 --> 00:49:16,380
I'm part of the flight crew.

485
00:49:16,411 --> 00:49:18,778
Please help me.

486
00:49:18,818 --> 00:49:20,746
You're all right.
You're all right. Easy.

487
00:49:20,786 --> 00:49:23,713
Hey, hang on.

488
00:49:23,753 --> 00:49:25,771
Hang on.
Who are you?

489
00:49:25,811 --> 00:49:29,309
What's your name?
Can you hear me?

490
00:49:31,317 --> 00:49:33,543
Gallo.

491
00:49:33,583 --> 00:49:36,710
Gallo? Is that it?

492
00:49:36,751 --> 00:49:39,717
Corporal Gallo?

493
00:49:39,746 --> 00:49:42,974
Yes.

494
00:49:43,014 --> 00:49:44,643
Where'd you come from, Gallo?

495
00:49:44,682 --> 00:49:46,581
From the...

496
00:49:46,610 --> 00:49:48,639
from the bridge.

497
00:49:48,679 --> 00:49:52,045
Bridge?
What happened?

498
00:49:52,085 --> 00:49:54,702
Where are we?
Can you tell me?

499
00:49:54,753 --> 00:49:57,650
Corporal.

500
00:49:58,679 --> 00:50:02,206
Tell me.
What happened?

501
00:50:15,282 --> 00:50:16,869
Where are we?

502
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:19,538
Hypersleep chamber,
personnel.

503
00:50:23,954 --> 00:50:26,072
Careful.

504
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:29,409
And don't slow me down.

505
00:50:40,146 --> 00:50:42,085
Most of these are empty.

506
00:50:42,114 --> 00:50:43,603
Where the hell is everyone?

507
00:50:43,653 --> 00:50:45,612
This is their main
hunting ground.

508
00:50:47,849 --> 00:50:49,478
Keep moving.

509
00:50:55,211 --> 00:50:58,809
Hey, my wife could be in here.

510
00:50:58,849 --> 00:51:01,976
She's a development settler?
Engineer?

511
00:51:03,483 --> 00:51:06,880
No, she's not part of the crew.
But spouses were brought with.

512
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:08,309
She's not here then.

513
00:51:08,349 --> 00:51:10,867
Do you know where
the family members are?

514
00:51:10,916 --> 00:51:12,603
Quiet.

515
00:51:23,653 --> 00:51:25,481
We have to keep moving.

516
00:51:25,512 --> 00:51:28,739
We don't want to stay
in the open for too long.

517
00:51:28,778 --> 00:51:31,246
Especially in here.

518
00:51:38,018 --> 00:51:39,068
We have to get going.

519
00:51:45,211 --> 00:51:46,650
We can't just leave him.

520
00:51:46,681 --> 00:51:48,739
Fuck that.
He's hunting.

521
00:51:48,778 --> 00:51:51,047
You wait for him?
Good luck.

522
00:51:53,682 --> 00:51:55,442
Wait.

523
00:52:17,518 --> 00:52:19,746
You all right?

524
00:52:21,445 --> 00:52:23,434
I'm all right.

525
00:52:26,010 --> 00:52:28,108
Oh God.

526
00:52:33,911 --> 00:52:36,010
There must be hundreds
of them in here.

527
00:53:14,851 --> 00:53:17,010
Where did they go?

528
00:53:19,817 --> 00:53:21,304
We have to get out of here.

529
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:08,367
We should run.

530
00:56:11,643 --> 00:56:13,981
Go!

531
00:57:01,543 --> 00:57:02,981
-What are you doing?
-We can't leave him.

532
00:57:20,445 --> 00:57:21,773
Bower, do you copy?
Bower, do you copy?

533
00:57:25,610 --> 00:57:27,048
You out there?

534
00:57:59,974 --> 00:58:02,641
Flight team 4.

535
00:58:02,681 --> 00:58:04,510
What are you doing?

536
00:58:04,550 --> 00:58:06,009
Just checking you.

537
00:58:06,048 --> 00:58:07,777
For what?

538
00:58:07,817 --> 00:58:10,375
Make sure you're okay.
You passed out.

539
00:58:10,414 --> 00:58:12,242
You were hysterical.

540
00:58:12,282 --> 00:58:15,579
-Who the hell are you?
-I'm Payton.

541
00:58:15,608 --> 00:58:18,666
-Lieutenant Payton.
-You're a lieutenant?

542
00:58:18,715 --> 00:58:20,873
You're team 4.

543
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:22,742
You're supposed
to be my predecessor.

544
00:58:25,079 --> 00:58:28,275
You said you came from the bridge.

545
00:58:28,315 --> 00:58:30,713
-Yeah, so?
-So where the hell are we?

546
00:58:30,744 --> 00:58:33,402
-I can't get any navigation in here.
-I don't know.

547
00:58:33,442 --> 00:58:36,038
Well, what did you see?
How did this whole thing get screwed up?

548
00:58:36,077 --> 00:58:39,605
Listen, I am not a navigator.

549
00:58:39,644 --> 00:58:42,442
-The stars all look alike.
-Take it easy, all right?

550
00:58:42,481 --> 00:58:45,210
Just want to make sure you're okay.

551
00:58:45,250 --> 00:58:47,608
-I'm fine.
-Is that your blood, Corporal?

552
00:58:50,244 --> 00:58:53,840
Some of it is, sir.

553
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:56,606
Who else's blood is it?

554
00:58:56,646 --> 00:58:58,875
There was something
wrong with them.

555
00:58:58,914 --> 00:59:01,503
Something wrong with who?

556
00:59:01,543 --> 00:59:04,070
Your crew?

557
00:59:04,110 --> 00:59:06,708
It was pandorum.

558
00:59:06,748 --> 00:59:09,574
I had to defend myself.

559
00:59:09,614 --> 00:59:11,583
I did.

560
00:59:11,612 --> 00:59:14,869
Pandorum?
Both of 'em?

561
00:59:14,909 --> 00:59:17,606
You don't believe me, do you?

562
00:59:19,574 --> 00:59:22,630
If you would have seen them...

563
00:59:24,748 --> 00:59:28,615
you would have done
the same thing, sir.

564
00:59:38,246 --> 00:59:40,143
I thought you knew
where we were going.

565
00:59:40,184 --> 00:59:43,170
I was trying to save our asses.

566
01:00:27,246 --> 01:00:29,835
Whoa whoa, easy, okay?

567
01:00:29,875 --> 01:00:31,842
No weapons.
No weapons.

568
01:00:33,751 --> 01:00:37,106
Excuse me.
Just please, come.

569
01:00:37,146 --> 01:00:40,014
Come in.
Okay.

570
01:00:40,043 --> 01:00:43,570
Please, make yourselves at home.

571
01:00:44,978 --> 01:00:46,777
You live here?

572
01:00:46,806 --> 01:00:49,105
-Who said that? What?
-You live here?

573
01:00:49,144 --> 01:00:52,512
I know it's not much to look at.

574
01:00:52,541 --> 01:00:54,978
But...

575
01:00:55,009 --> 01:00:56,836
they can't get in here

576
01:00:56,876 --> 01:00:58,534
unless I want them to.

577
01:00:58,574 --> 01:00:59,943
Why would you want them to?

578
01:00:59,974 --> 01:01:02,371
I had no idea
there was any crew left.

579
01:01:02,411 --> 01:01:05,438
Have you met any other flyers?

580
01:01:05,478 --> 01:01:07,206
No.

581
01:01:08,746 --> 01:01:12,012
Not in a long long time.

582
01:01:12,041 --> 01:01:15,438
Why don't you come on
down so we can meet properly?

583
01:01:15,478 --> 01:01:18,445
You think I survived this long
trusting strangers?

584
01:01:18,474 --> 01:01:19,913
Wait.

585
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:24,599
I have a question for you.
Where you got to be?

586
01:01:24,648 --> 01:01:27,876
Reactor bay.
Know how to get there?

587
01:01:27,916 --> 01:01:29,974
Yeah, I do.

588
01:01:31,443 --> 01:01:34,309
Why would you want
to go to the reactor?

589
01:01:34,349 --> 01:01:37,137
Oh, I get it.
I get it.

590
01:01:37,177 --> 01:01:40,632
You just woke up, huh?
You hungry?

591
01:01:40,681 --> 01:01:42,969
'Cause I can cook.

592
01:01:43,010 --> 01:01:45,777
I really got a treat for you guys.

593
01:01:45,807 --> 01:01:49,144
but I must admit it's really
difficult to season

594
01:01:49,175 --> 01:01:51,172
when you're only using
a motor oil base.

595
01:01:51,213 --> 01:01:54,269
But if we use our imagination,

596
01:01:54,309 --> 01:01:56,706
we got something here.

597
01:01:56,746 --> 01:01:58,715
It kinda tastes like...

598
01:02:00,682 --> 01:02:02,731
herb and butter dogshit.

599
01:02:02,780 --> 01:02:04,969
How long have you been awake?

600
01:02:05,009 --> 01:02:07,306
Let me see... what's today?

601
01:02:07,346 --> 01:02:09,574
Tuesday, so I have no idea.

602
01:02:14,250 --> 01:02:17,764
Ah, well, let's eat, shall we?

603
01:02:17,815 --> 01:02:20,472
It's kosher.

604
01:02:20,512 --> 01:02:23,739
I'm a cook, you know.
Says so right here on my tattoo.

605
01:02:25,947 --> 01:02:27,606
Is that safe?

606
01:02:27,646 --> 01:02:29,614
Compared to what?

607
01:02:29,643 --> 01:02:32,012
Those things out there,

608
01:02:32,041 --> 01:02:34,668
could it have been something

609
01:02:34,708 --> 01:02:38,264
that crawled out of your tank or lab
or something?

610
01:02:38,313 --> 01:02:40,302
No, that's not possible.

611
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:44,927
Then it's some kind of life form
that got onboard.

612
01:02:44,978 --> 01:02:46,637
Or something.

613
01:02:46,677 --> 01:02:48,735
Or something
that was already onboard

614
01:02:48,775 --> 01:02:50,972
with us in the hyperbunks.

615
01:02:51,012 --> 01:02:52,911
What do you mean?

616
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:55,938
I believe it's the accelerator.

617
01:02:55,978 --> 01:02:59,034
The synthetic enzyme
in our feeding tubes

618
01:02:59,074 --> 01:03:01,172
that would help our bodies
adjust and adapt

619
01:03:01,211 --> 01:03:03,110
to the environmental
conditions on Tanis.

620
01:03:03,139 --> 01:03:05,936
From what I've seen,

621
01:03:05,976 --> 01:03:09,414
these things have adapted
to the ship instead.

622
01:03:11,112 --> 01:03:14,568
So you're saying that they're passengers
who have mutated?

623
01:03:14,608 --> 01:03:17,405
That stuff in our blood is supposed
to jump-start evolution.

624
01:03:17,445 --> 01:03:20,572
Well, why would they
be affected and we're not?

625
01:03:20,612 --> 01:03:23,630
Maybe they've been awake
much longer than we think.

626
01:03:23,679 --> 01:03:26,646
-Longer than him.
-Huh.

627
01:03:26,677 --> 01:03:28,644
-You don't know what happened to us?
-You do?

628
01:03:28,675 --> 01:03:32,130
Oh, I've been around
for a while.

629
01:03:32,181 --> 01:03:35,277
I know what I've seen.

630
01:03:43,909 --> 01:03:45,896
What do you think you're doing?

631
01:03:45,947 --> 01:03:47,606
What is that?

632
01:03:47,646 --> 01:03:50,402
It's just a sedative
to help you relax.

633
01:03:50,443 --> 01:03:53,070
Then you take it
and relax.

634
01:03:53,110 --> 01:03:56,766
Take it down a notch.
We're on the same team here.

635
01:03:58,313 --> 01:04:00,472
Do you know
the symptoms of pandorum?

636
01:04:00,512 --> 01:04:02,699
-What?
-Orbital dysfunctional syndrome.

637
01:04:02,739 --> 01:04:04,438
-Pandorum.
-I've seen it before.

638
01:04:04,478 --> 01:04:07,065
Ever witness
the symptoms firsthand?

639
01:04:07,115 --> 01:04:09,164
It's not something
you can easily detect.

640
01:04:09,213 --> 01:04:11,681
It starts with a shiver, an itch,

641
01:04:11,710 --> 01:04:13,539
a slow boil...

642
01:04:13,579 --> 01:04:16,637
the biological side effects
of flying deep space

643
01:04:16,677 --> 01:04:18,233
feeding into paranoia.

644
01:04:18,273 --> 01:04:20,802
And the paranoid
brain feeding the side effects.

645
01:04:20,842 --> 01:04:23,500
A downward spiral.
A descent into madness.

646
01:04:23,550 --> 01:04:26,876
There is no shutting off the heat
no matter what you do.

647
01:04:26,916 --> 01:04:29,503
It'll boil over.

648
01:04:29,543 --> 01:04:31,670
You don't believe me.

649
01:04:31,710 --> 01:04:34,079
I didn't say that.

650
01:04:34,108 --> 01:04:36,835
How could they both have had it?
The odds are insurmountable.

651
01:04:36,876 --> 01:04:38,744
I wasn't about
to question your actions.

652
01:04:38,773 --> 01:04:41,240
We all know pandorum
is greatly affected

653
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:43,509
by any substantial
psychological trauma.

654
01:04:43,548 --> 01:04:46,376
-It has an emotional trigger effect.
-That's what they say.

655
01:04:46,407 --> 01:04:50,143
How do you think you would react
if you knew the truth?

656
01:04:53,509 --> 01:04:56,565
The truth about what?

657
01:04:56,606 --> 01:04:59,472
Boom.
Oh, how the whole world cheered

658
01:04:59,512 --> 01:05:02,530
to the thunder of earth's
mightiest creation...

659
01:05:02,579 --> 01:05:04,137
Elysium.
Elysium.

660
01:05:04,177 --> 01:05:06,436
One small spark

661
01:05:06,476 --> 01:05:09,373
to ignite the heavens
for the heroes

662
01:05:09,413 --> 01:05:11,670
to venture farther and farther

663
01:05:11,710 --> 01:05:14,409
than any of mankind's machines.

664
01:05:14,449 --> 01:05:17,405
And we slept.
We slept a slumber so deep

665
01:05:17,445 --> 01:05:19,202
that no one had dared before

666
01:05:19,242 --> 01:05:23,179
as three little Indians
were left to mind the store.

667
01:05:23,208 --> 01:05:24,737
We were only into our second term.

668
01:05:24,777 --> 01:05:26,005
All flight systems nominal.

669
01:05:26,045 --> 01:05:28,773
I picked up symptoms
with my CO and 2nd lieutenant.

670
01:05:28,813 --> 01:05:32,639
Mild symptoms. Nothing I thought
would become a problem.

671
01:05:32,679 --> 01:05:36,036
-Until we got the transmission.
-What transmission?

672
01:05:36,077 --> 01:05:38,563
Mother Earth's final call.

673
01:05:38,614 --> 01:05:42,769
All God's creation ending
with mere words of encouragement.

674
01:05:50,181 --> 01:05:52,699
What does it say?

675
01:06:04,478 --> 01:06:07,034
You're all that's left of us.

676
01:06:08,974 --> 01:06:12,429
Good luck.
God bless.

677
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:15,068
And Godspeed.

678
01:06:16,106 --> 01:06:17,474
Earth...

679
01:06:20,411 --> 01:06:22,070
is gone?

680
01:06:22,110 --> 01:06:24,237
Poof.
Wiped away.

681
01:06:24,277 --> 01:06:27,144
We ran a full sweep of the grid
and they were gone.

682
01:06:27,175 --> 01:06:29,972
One day there,
the next nothing.

683
01:06:30,012 --> 01:06:32,170
In one day?

684
01:06:32,210 --> 01:06:34,838
It had to be nuclear
or an asteroid.

685
01:06:34,878 --> 01:06:36,365
Does it matter?

686
01:06:36,405 --> 01:06:38,842
My fellow crew members
didn't take the news too well.

687
01:06:38,873 --> 01:06:41,900
I wanted to wake the primary crew,

688
01:06:41,940 --> 01:06:44,467
but my 2nd lieutenant
was already over the edge.

689
01:06:44,507 --> 01:06:47,903
Three little Indians
with the burden to bear.

690
01:06:47,943 --> 01:06:50,311
No more law.
Nothing left to care.

691
01:06:50,342 --> 01:06:53,938
Just three little souls whose
destiny had become undone

692
01:06:53,978 --> 01:06:58,005
because there was
chop chop chop chop...

693
01:06:59,141 --> 01:07:01,369
then there was only one.

694
01:07:01,409 --> 01:07:03,927
One little Indian left.

695
01:07:03,978 --> 01:07:05,905
They were my commanding officers,

696
01:07:05,945 --> 01:07:08,244
men who had guided me
through FT.

697
01:07:08,273 --> 01:07:11,400
But it wasn't them anymore.
They were gone.

698
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:14,307
-I had no choice!
-Corporal Gallo!

699
01:07:14,347 --> 01:07:18,074
One little Indian left,
alone with all his doom.

700
01:07:18,114 --> 01:07:20,900
He refuses to go to bed,
so what does he do?

701
01:07:20,940 --> 01:07:24,876
He decides to stay up
and play in his room.

702
01:07:24,907 --> 01:07:27,503
What nasty little games
he would play

703
01:07:27,543 --> 01:07:29,472
with his slumbering prey.

704
01:07:29,512 --> 01:07:31,869
He was slayer, he was master.

705
01:07:31,909 --> 01:07:34,777
He was both God and the devil.

706
01:07:34,807 --> 01:07:37,744
See, that's what some would say.
He would grow to manhood,

707
01:07:37,775 --> 01:07:39,800
a self-proclaimed king.

708
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:43,498
Master of his own vessel.
Home to his own sin.

709
01:07:43,547 --> 01:07:46,445
He just cast out
all who had behaved.

710
01:07:46,474 --> 01:07:49,911
Just exiled to the cargo hold

711
01:07:49,942 --> 01:07:51,739
to fend amongst themselves...

712
01:07:51,780 --> 01:07:56,106
...and scavenge,
feeding off their own.

713
01:07:56,146 --> 01:07:58,403
Evil grew.

714
01:07:58,443 --> 01:08:01,900
The king no longer wanted to play.

715
01:08:01,940 --> 01:08:05,436
So he returned
to his bed of slumber.

716
01:08:05,476 --> 01:08:08,032
And while the king slept,

717
01:08:08,072 --> 01:08:11,059
a whole new world of evil grew

718
01:08:11,110 --> 01:08:12,838
as we wept.

719
01:08:13,947 --> 01:08:16,564
It starts with a shiver, an itch.

720
01:08:16,604 --> 01:08:18,733
We all know pandorum
is greatly affected

721
01:08:18,773 --> 01:08:21,039
by any substantial
psychological trauma.

722
01:08:21,079 --> 01:08:23,238
It has an emotional trigger effect.

723
01:09:05,105 --> 01:09:06,204
What are you doing?

724
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:12,208
He's gonna fucking eat us.

725
01:09:12,238 --> 01:09:14,506
It's not personal, guys.

726
01:09:14,546 --> 01:09:18,274
It's just survival of the fittest.

727
01:09:18,313 --> 01:09:22,109
Or maybe it's the brightest.

728
01:09:22,139 --> 01:09:24,296
You understand what I'm saying?

729
01:09:25,345 --> 01:09:27,404
-You gassed us.
-Oh, yes.

730
01:09:27,444 --> 01:09:29,201
And I'm sorry,
but I'm a little too old

731
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:31,769
and too tired for the honorable way
of hunting game.

732
01:09:31,809 --> 01:09:35,395
You better make sure I'm dead...

733
01:09:38,613 --> 01:09:41,798
You don't have to do this.
We have to save the ship.

734
01:09:41,838 --> 01:09:45,564
Don't sweat it
and save me the speeches.

735
01:09:45,604 --> 01:09:48,403
I wouldn't have survived this long
if I had a heart.

736
01:09:49,841 --> 01:09:53,537
You know, a strange thing,
the survival instinct.

737
01:09:53,578 --> 01:09:57,373
I mean, there's nothing really left
to live for.

738
01:09:57,413 --> 01:10:00,969
Don't be fucking stupid.
I can save the fucking ship.

739
01:10:04,746 --> 01:10:08,601
Question is,
what would be more stupid?

740
01:10:08,641 --> 01:10:11,130
Trusting the ship will hold
to see another day

741
01:10:11,180 --> 01:10:14,476
when it's kept me alive
for all these years?

742
01:10:14,506 --> 01:10:16,635
Or trusting somebody

743
01:10:16,675 --> 01:10:18,802
who's desperate enough
to say anything

744
01:10:18,842 --> 01:10:22,069
just when I'm about to carve
a steak out of his girlfriend?

745
01:10:23,707 --> 01:10:25,694
Listen to the ship.

746
01:10:25,743 --> 01:10:27,533
What about the ship?

747
01:10:29,570 --> 01:10:31,408
The power surges...

748
01:10:31,439 --> 01:10:34,536
the reactor is in its final stage.

749
01:10:34,576 --> 01:10:37,703
We have less time than I thought.

750
01:10:37,743 --> 01:10:41,679
The final phase before shutdown,

751
01:10:41,708 --> 01:10:44,077
before we lose everything

752
01:10:44,106 --> 01:10:46,543
and everyone onboard.

753
01:10:46,573 --> 01:10:50,470
If we don't reset it now,

754
01:10:50,511 --> 01:10:53,737
everything is lost.

755
01:10:53,777 --> 01:10:58,033
She has been all moody lately.

756
01:10:58,073 --> 01:11:00,599
Very moody.

757
01:11:00,639 --> 01:11:03,337
Hey, listen.

758
01:11:03,377 --> 01:11:05,864
Hey, I get it.

759
01:11:05,904 --> 01:11:09,470
What? You get what?

760
01:11:09,511 --> 01:11:12,698
You did what you had to do.

761
01:11:12,738 --> 01:11:16,404
You made it.
No one's gonna judge you.

762
01:11:16,444 --> 01:11:18,962
No one's gonna judge you.

763
01:11:19,011 --> 01:11:21,478
You are a survivor.

764
01:11:22,936 --> 01:11:26,304
And right now we...

765
01:11:26,344 --> 01:11:29,201
have to reset the reactor.

766
01:11:34,176 --> 01:11:38,113
How long before the ship dies?

767
01:11:38,143 --> 01:11:39,831
The truth.

768
01:11:39,871 --> 01:11:42,537
I don't know.

769
01:11:42,578 --> 01:11:45,335
Take a fucking guess.

770
01:11:46,944 --> 01:11:49,770
An hour. Less.

771
01:12:01,677 --> 01:12:04,136
-Well?
-We're in this together.

772
01:12:04,176 --> 01:12:06,474
I need your radio.
We don't have much time.

773
01:12:12,677 --> 01:12:14,735
Payton, do you copy?

774
01:12:14,775 --> 01:12:16,363
Do you copy?
Can you hear me?

775
01:12:16,404 --> 01:12:19,530
Payton, do you copy?
Can you hear me?

776
01:12:19,570 --> 01:12:21,768
I'm here.
Where are you?

777
01:12:21,807 --> 01:12:24,564
Storage tank
somewhere below B level.

778
01:12:24,604 --> 01:12:27,132
Midship sector 12, I think.

779
01:12:27,172 --> 01:12:29,770
How the hell did you get all the way
to the other side of the ship?

780
01:12:29,810 --> 01:12:31,798
The reactor is shutting down fast.

781
01:12:31,838 --> 01:12:34,836
I need you to access the memory banks
from the last power surge

782
01:12:34,876 --> 01:12:38,103
-and run a Kolzer complex test.
-Accessing memory banks now.

783
01:12:38,143 --> 01:12:40,201
Running Kolzer complex.

784
01:12:46,542 --> 01:12:48,400
You're not gonna like this.

785
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:50,698
Test says you have
less than 47 minutes

786
01:12:50,738 --> 01:12:52,867
before complete system failure.

787
01:12:52,907 --> 01:12:55,534
-That's not much time.
-How do we get you in there?

788
01:12:55,574 --> 01:12:57,971
-I need you to give us a path.
-Copy.

789
01:13:01,078 --> 01:13:03,197
Move it.

790
01:13:29,171 --> 01:13:31,109
No. It's a child.

791
01:13:31,139 --> 01:13:33,627
Child?
That's no fucking child.

792
01:13:41,137 --> 01:13:42,765
They are breeding.

793
01:13:42,805 --> 01:13:45,064
Little bastard.
He went and got daddy.

794
01:13:57,742 --> 01:14:00,039
This is not gonna work.
There's too many of them.

795
01:14:00,069 --> 01:14:02,596
We must be close
to where they live.

796
01:14:02,636 --> 01:14:05,363
Great.
Now we're fucking stuck here.

797
01:14:08,171 --> 01:14:10,298
What's so important
on the other side of that door?

798
01:14:10,338 --> 01:14:12,827
The bridge.
We can take control of guidance

799
01:14:12,877 --> 01:14:14,274
as soon as we get on the bridge.

800
01:14:14,305 --> 01:14:16,863
How's that going to help?
This ship is dying.

801
01:14:16,912 --> 01:14:19,430
We should be focusing
on how to save ourselves.

802
01:14:19,470 --> 01:14:22,567
Oh, that's right.
The Boy Scout is going to save us.

803
01:14:22,606 --> 01:14:24,505
He can do it.

804
01:14:26,172 --> 01:14:29,369
24 hours ago
he didn't know his own name.

805
01:14:29,409 --> 01:14:32,268
Now you think he's ready
to reconfigure

806
01:14:32,307 --> 01:14:34,635
a nuclear reactor?

807
01:14:34,675 --> 01:14:36,832
If they don't leave soon,

808
01:14:36,872 --> 01:14:38,930
there's no point in even going.

809
01:14:40,179 --> 01:14:42,006
What are you doing?

810
01:14:42,037 --> 01:14:44,634
These are our families

811
01:14:44,673 --> 01:14:47,141
from flight personnel.

812
01:14:47,171 --> 01:14:50,368
They're all dead.

813
01:14:51,507 --> 01:14:53,636
You think she's here?

814
01:14:53,676 --> 01:14:56,144
No, she's...

815
01:14:56,173 --> 01:14:57,971
she's not here.

816
01:14:59,570 --> 01:15:01,568
How do you know for sure?

817
01:15:01,606 --> 01:15:03,864
'Cause she wouldn't come with me.

818
01:15:13,105 --> 01:15:16,132
She's not on this flight.

819
01:15:16,172 --> 01:15:18,201
She left me.

820
01:15:34,673 --> 01:15:36,761
There was nothing left for me,

821
01:15:36,801 --> 01:15:38,740
so I enlisted.

822
01:15:38,770 --> 01:15:41,707
She's the reason why I left.

823
01:15:43,204 --> 01:15:46,641
Well, then she saved your life.

824
01:15:46,671 --> 01:15:49,159
That's very tragic.

825
01:15:49,210 --> 01:15:52,136
But we've got to move on.
I'm sick of this shit.

826
01:15:52,176 --> 01:15:53,466
-For what?
-What?

827
01:15:53,506 --> 01:15:55,304
-For what?
-Shh.

828
01:15:55,344 --> 01:15:57,360
-They're all gone.
-Shh.

829
01:15:57,411 --> 01:16:00,837
-There's nothing left.
-Shh! Shut your fucking mouth.

830
01:16:00,877 --> 01:16:03,135
There's nothing left to go back to.

831
01:16:03,175 --> 01:16:05,573
You're wrong.

832
01:16:05,603 --> 01:16:08,539
Hey, we were meant to go on.

833
01:16:10,109 --> 01:16:13,305
And we were meant to survive.

834
01:16:13,336 --> 01:16:15,363
And now it's more
important than ever.

835
01:16:15,404 --> 01:16:17,391
We're wasting time.

836
01:16:17,442 --> 01:16:19,960
-I remember.
-What?

837
01:16:21,978 --> 01:16:24,234
Clock's ticking.

838
01:16:28,310 --> 01:16:31,277
Payton's wife Marianne.

839
01:16:38,240 --> 01:16:39,929
I remember.

840
01:16:42,305 --> 01:16:45,203
Bower was right about one thing:

841
01:16:45,243 --> 01:16:47,570
Once this thing shuts down
we are as good as dead.

842
01:16:47,610 --> 01:16:49,769
What are you muttering about?

843
01:16:49,809 --> 01:16:53,234
I'm saying once it's done
we're done.

844
01:16:53,274 --> 01:16:55,603
But we still have a way out of this.

845
01:16:55,643 --> 01:16:58,800
You're suggesting what, Corporal?

846
01:16:58,840 --> 01:17:00,997
We can launch ourselves in the pods

847
01:17:01,037 --> 01:17:04,434
before the ignition systems
are completely dead, sir.

848
01:17:04,474 --> 01:17:06,561
That's suicide.

849
01:17:06,601 --> 01:17:08,001
We can buy a few days,

850
01:17:08,039 --> 01:17:10,029
which is better
than what we have left here.

851
01:17:14,005 --> 01:17:16,302
The reactor is close.

852
01:17:16,342 --> 01:17:17,801
You can hear it breathe.

853
01:17:32,435 --> 01:17:34,095
Yeah, this is it...

854
01:17:35,342 --> 01:17:38,430
a descent into hell itself.

855
01:17:51,536 --> 01:17:54,304
How long do you think that reactor
has been sitting there, huh?

856
01:17:54,344 --> 01:17:56,862
That thing could melt down

857
01:17:56,912 --> 01:17:58,569
when he tries to fire the core.

858
01:18:00,408 --> 01:18:02,636
This ship could be ripped in half.

859
01:18:02,676 --> 01:18:06,032
Stand down, Corporal.
We are not abandoning anything

860
01:18:06,072 --> 01:18:08,270
and we are not leaving them behind.

861
01:18:08,310 --> 01:18:11,167
We can't stay on this ship!
You know that!

862
01:18:11,207 --> 01:18:14,074
I said stand down, Corporal!

863
01:18:15,542 --> 01:18:17,201
That's an order.

864
01:18:46,770 --> 01:18:48,000
Christ Almighty.

865
01:19:19,309 --> 01:19:20,827
Don't let go.

866
01:19:58,439 --> 01:19:59,927
He's in.

867
01:20:00,936 --> 01:20:02,805
We're gonna get ourselves
out of this.

868
01:20:02,836 --> 01:20:04,462
-Trust me.
-Trust you?

869
01:20:04,502 --> 01:20:07,529
How can I trust someone who
isn't even honest with himself?

870
01:20:07,569 --> 01:20:10,127
We still have time.

871
01:20:10,176 --> 01:20:13,073
-You have to listen to me.
-Don't do that.

872
01:20:13,104 --> 01:20:14,802
Don't do what?

873
01:20:14,842 --> 01:20:18,170
Don't talk to me like I'm some child
that needs reassurance.

874
01:20:18,210 --> 01:20:19,797
Then calm the fuck down.

875
01:20:19,837 --> 01:20:22,864
I know this ship and I know what
she's capable of better than anyone.

876
01:20:22,904 --> 01:20:26,461
I know what she can and can't do.
Why are we even arguing?

877
01:20:26,501 --> 01:20:28,729
If you want to stay here
to die that is your choice.

878
01:20:28,769 --> 01:20:32,065
-I gave you an order.
-Not mine. Not mine!

879
01:20:32,105 --> 01:20:33,573
Corporal.

880
01:20:33,603 --> 01:20:35,572
Who's the one being
irrational here, Lieutenant?

881
01:20:35,601 --> 01:20:37,699
Who's the one being delusional?

882
01:20:37,739 --> 01:20:40,537
I'm getting off this ship.
The flight is over.

883
01:20:40,577 --> 01:20:41,905
Over!

884
01:21:42,604 --> 01:21:45,261
-Don't shoot yourself into space.
-Shut up.

885
01:21:45,301 --> 01:21:48,029
-I'm getting off this ship.
-Bower's going to reboot the reactor.

886
01:21:48,069 --> 01:21:49,766
Shut up.

887
01:21:51,136 --> 01:21:53,663
It wasn't the crew
that was sick, was it?

888
01:21:53,703 --> 01:21:55,731
-Finish the code.
-Look at yourself.

889
01:21:55,771 --> 01:21:58,637
-You're the one with the symptoms.
-Finish it!

890
01:22:13,333 --> 01:22:15,332
What are you doing?

891
01:22:15,372 --> 01:22:17,300
It's for your own good.

892
01:22:17,340 --> 01:22:19,597
What the fuck are you doing?

893
01:22:19,637 --> 01:22:21,576
You're not well.

894
01:22:21,605 --> 01:22:24,122
You just need the proper treatment.

895
01:22:26,539 --> 01:22:29,367
Let me out, God damn it!

896
01:22:29,407 --> 01:22:32,894
Open it!
That is an order, motherfucker!

897
01:22:32,934 --> 01:22:35,930
It's not your fault.

898
01:22:35,970 --> 01:22:39,457
I will cut you to fucking bits.
Open it!

899
01:22:39,507 --> 01:22:41,336
Open it!
I will carve you up!

900
01:22:41,376 --> 01:22:43,774
Your mind has turned
against itself.

901
01:22:43,804 --> 01:22:46,239
You're killing us!

902
01:22:46,270 --> 01:22:48,568
We are all going to die, Corporal.

903
01:22:59,506 --> 01:23:01,564
Holy fuck.

904
01:23:46,069 --> 01:23:49,006
Oh, shit.

905
01:24:47,137 --> 01:24:48,296
They're coming.

906
01:24:56,738 --> 01:24:58,368
Hurry up!

907
01:24:58,408 --> 01:24:59,627
Shit.

908
01:25:04,203 --> 01:25:06,359
Come on, come on, come on.

909
01:25:34,502 --> 01:25:38,197
He did it.
Boy Scout did it.

910
01:25:38,237 --> 01:25:41,164
You were right.
Now let me out.

911
01:25:41,204 --> 01:25:43,572
I can help.

912
01:25:43,601 --> 01:25:45,590
I'll help you.

913
01:25:48,905 --> 01:25:51,024
What are you doing?

914
01:25:51,073 --> 01:25:53,192
Are you still trying
to get on the bridge?

915
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:56,529
You do not want
to go in there, Corporal.

916
01:25:59,237 --> 01:26:01,135
What are you gonna tell them, huh?

917
01:26:01,175 --> 01:26:04,141
-Bower will be coming back here.
-Shut up.

918
01:26:04,171 --> 01:26:06,029
They'll know what you did.

919
01:27:06,768 --> 01:27:08,167
Where do you think you're going?

920
01:27:08,206 --> 01:27:09,824
Quiet.

921
01:27:09,864 --> 01:27:12,203
Think about what you're doing, sir.

922
01:27:13,372 --> 01:27:16,198
Shut the fuck up.

923
01:27:17,938 --> 01:27:19,956
They will never let you
get away with this.

924
01:27:20,006 --> 01:27:21,264
Shut up!

925
01:27:37,737 --> 01:27:40,064
They're everywhere.

926
01:28:03,502 --> 01:28:04,760
Asshole!

927
01:29:05,838 --> 01:29:08,265
We both know who needs this shot.

928
01:29:08,305 --> 01:29:11,563
-Stay back.
-Who's the one suffering here, sir?

929
01:29:11,603 --> 01:29:13,032
I mean it!

930
01:29:14,939 --> 01:29:17,427
What do you want from me?

931
01:29:19,265 --> 01:29:22,061
Your mind has turned against itself.

932
01:29:25,298 --> 01:29:27,695
I'm gonna fucking carve you up.

933
01:29:41,274 --> 01:29:43,261
Who are you?

934
01:29:54,369 --> 01:29:57,067
Ahem. Made it.

935
01:30:00,404 --> 01:30:02,231
I was with your boy.

936
01:30:02,271 --> 01:30:05,759
I helped him get all this started.

937
01:30:05,798 --> 01:30:07,497
I see you're a flyer too.

938
01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:56,127
Where's your lieutenant?

939
01:30:56,167 --> 01:30:58,225
He's not my lieutenant.

940
01:31:11,271 --> 01:31:14,099
Where are we?

941
01:31:14,139 --> 01:31:15,728
What's happened to us?

942
01:31:15,768 --> 01:31:18,324
The flight log

943
01:31:18,364 --> 01:31:21,462
will tell us how long we've been out
and how far we've gone.

944
01:31:36,438 --> 01:31:38,625
It seems

945
01:31:38,664 --> 01:31:41,792
my mild memory lapse

946
01:31:41,832 --> 01:31:43,930
has finally worn off, Lieutenant.

947
01:31:43,970 --> 01:31:45,988
Who the hell are you?

948
01:31:46,037 --> 01:31:49,333
Gallo, Corporal.

949
01:31:49,363 --> 01:31:51,862
I was younger than you
when I first came onboard.

950
01:31:51,902 --> 01:31:55,837
Funny, I can't even remember what life
was like before this flight began.

951
01:31:55,868 --> 01:31:57,735
It's all I have.

952
01:31:59,234 --> 01:32:01,432
You're the one who received
the final transmission.

953
01:32:01,472 --> 01:32:03,161
You stayed awake.
You broke the rotation.

954
01:32:03,201 --> 01:32:05,358
You killed your crew.

955
01:32:05,398 --> 01:32:08,524
How the hell would you know that?

956
01:32:08,564 --> 01:32:10,532
Where are we?

957
01:32:13,539 --> 01:32:15,627
Go ahead, take a peek.

958
01:32:23,770 --> 01:32:25,569
You tell me.

959
01:32:30,972 --> 01:32:33,090
What have you done with us?

960
01:32:33,130 --> 01:32:34,927
You don't get it, kid.

961
01:32:34,967 --> 01:32:37,195
There's no one left to judge.

962
01:32:37,235 --> 01:32:40,792
Where are the stars?
Oh my God.

963
01:32:40,832 --> 01:32:43,229
God?
You think God survived?

964
01:32:43,270 --> 01:32:45,757
He's dead along with
the rest of humanity.

965
01:32:45,797 --> 01:32:47,666
There's no law or order,

966
01:32:47,706 --> 01:32:49,394
no good or evil.
Just us.

967
01:32:49,434 --> 01:32:52,920
And you think you're going
to be the one to judge me?

968
01:32:52,970 --> 01:32:54,229
You want to take a shot at me?

969
01:32:54,269 --> 01:32:55,927
You know what?
I just might.

970
01:32:55,967 --> 01:32:57,395
You are suffering, son.

971
01:32:57,435 --> 01:33:00,992
I can see it in your face.
I've been there.

972
01:33:01,032 --> 01:33:03,590
Just imagine just for a minute,

973
01:33:03,640 --> 01:33:06,697
imagine yourself without the chains
of your morality.

974
01:33:06,737 --> 01:33:08,663
You'd even surprise yourself.

975
01:33:08,703 --> 01:33:10,532
It's the ultimate freedom.

976
01:33:10,572 --> 01:33:12,500
No.

977
01:33:12,529 --> 01:33:14,658
This isn't freedom.

978
01:33:14,698 --> 01:33:16,686
This is pandorum.

979
01:33:16,737 --> 01:33:20,533
Oh, pandorum. Pandorum isn't
what they warned us about.

980
01:33:20,573 --> 01:33:22,591
I know it's frightening at first,
terrifying in fact.

981
01:33:22,631 --> 01:33:25,429
Isn't that what you're feeling right now,
terrible fear?

982
01:33:25,469 --> 01:33:29,063
Let go and on the other side
of it is divine clarity.

983
01:33:29,103 --> 01:33:30,761
Purity.
Enlightenment.

984
01:33:30,801 --> 01:33:32,770
Shut up!
What's out there?

985
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:35,426
You are resisting what is.

986
01:33:35,466 --> 01:33:38,364
You have to let go of
your petty concept of reality.

987
01:33:38,404 --> 01:33:40,563
That's just baggage
from the old world.

988
01:33:40,603 --> 01:33:43,289
And we both know that didn't work
out very well now, did it?

989
01:33:43,329 --> 01:33:47,235
They fucked up our planet.
Life eats life.

990
01:33:47,265 --> 01:33:50,492
And all that's left is what is.

991
01:33:50,532 --> 01:33:52,591
This ship is a seed

992
01:33:52,631 --> 01:33:55,188
from which we can create a new world.

993
01:33:55,238 --> 01:33:56,395
Shut up!
What's out there?!

994
01:33:56,435 --> 01:33:58,194
A new world.
A natural state.

995
01:33:58,234 --> 01:34:00,421
-Raw, beautiful...
-What do you see?

996
01:34:00,471 --> 01:34:03,658
...perfect.
I am offering you the kingdom.

997
01:34:03,698 --> 01:34:06,327
And all that's holding you back

998
01:34:06,367 --> 01:34:08,024
is your own fear.

999
01:34:10,271 --> 01:34:12,201
Still the Boy Scout,
hey, kid?

1000
01:34:12,229 --> 01:34:14,787
There will always be law

1001
01:34:14,837 --> 01:34:17,426
and you will pay
for what you've done.

1002
01:34:17,466 --> 01:34:21,192
Even if that means I have
to pull the sick out of you.

1003
01:34:24,099 --> 01:34:25,926
-Bower!
-What is it?

1004
01:34:48,036 --> 01:34:50,052
We've already crashed.

1005
01:34:50,103 --> 01:34:53,757
We've been on Tanis
all this time.

1006
01:34:55,237 --> 01:34:57,255
All this time.

1007
01:35:01,230 --> 01:35:03,958
I guess this thing
does land itself.

1008
01:35:03,998 --> 01:35:05,966
Doesn't float too well though,
does it?

1009
01:35:10,902 --> 01:35:12,590
Let go of your fear.

1010
01:35:13,798 --> 01:35:16,426
This is where I'll push through.

1011
01:35:19,931 --> 01:35:22,420
Shh shh.

1012
01:35:22,470 --> 01:35:24,368
They're coming in.

1013
01:35:29,532 --> 01:35:30,730
Attaboy.

1014
01:36:12,300 --> 01:36:14,556
They're coming in.

1015
01:36:14,596 --> 01:36:17,323
What are you doing?

1016
01:36:26,136 --> 01:36:27,725
Why don't you shoot?

1017
01:37:25,067 --> 01:37:26,725
Are you crazy?

1018
01:37:32,929 --> 01:37:36,095
-Do you see that?
-Fuck him.

1019
01:37:36,136 --> 01:37:38,153
-We need to get out of here.
-Hold on.

1020
01:37:38,203 --> 01:37:41,260
Not like this.
We can't die like this.

1021
01:37:41,300 --> 01:37:42,729
Hold on.

1022
01:38:18,462 --> 01:38:21,229
What?
No, I can't...

1023
01:38:21,270 --> 01:38:22,998
Just breathe.

1024
01:39:27,962 --> 01:39:30,291
Hey. Hey.

1025
01:39:36,863 --> 01:39:38,353
Just breathe.

1026
01:39:41,130 --> 01:39:43,287
It's safe to wake up now.
