1
00:02:29,559 --> 00:02:31,639
Police on scene
are approaching the suspect.

2
00:02:31,799 --> 00:02:34,599
This chase started
at approximately 1:30 a. m..

3
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:36,359
in the Mercer Island area..

4
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:38,920
and has ended here
at Pearl Street Bridge.

5
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,520
Responding to a 911 call..

6
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,560
in an apparent carjacking
by an African-American male.

7
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,640
Name is Lisa Reane..

8
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,040
youngest daughter of
Congressman Richard Reane.

9
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,880
Suspect has been
preliminary ID'd..

10
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,961
as John Curtis, who's wanted
for armed robbery, drug..

11
00:02:55,121 --> 00:02:57,641
Shots have been fired.
We have shots fired.

12
00:02:57,801 --> 00:02:59,641
The suspect and
his hostage are down.

13
00:02:59,801 --> 00:03:01,801
Police are moving in.

14
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:39,403
If you chose to believe
a traitor's testimony, fine.

15
00:03:39,563 --> 00:03:42,243
But in the same situation,
I'd do it again.

16
00:03:42,403 --> 00:03:44,323
I'm not gonna apologize
for doing my job.

17
00:03:44,484 --> 00:03:46,404
I'm not gonna
apologize for doing my job.

18
00:04:16,525 --> 00:04:18,326
Simply put, just
because you're a cop..

19
00:04:18,486 --> 00:04:21,446
doesn't mean the laws
don't apply to you.

20
00:04:21,606 --> 00:04:23,726
It's not the wild, wild West anymore.

21
00:04:23,886 --> 00:04:26,366
It's not the wild, wild West anymore.

22
00:04:26,526 --> 00:04:28,486
Not the wild, wild West anymore.

23
00:04:28,646 --> 00:04:30,966
Wild, wild West anymore.

24
00:05:18,289 --> 00:05:19,369
That's 5 and..

25
00:05:41,731 --> 00:05:43,331
Everybody get the fuck down!

26
00:05:43,491 --> 00:05:44,491
Get out of here!

27
00:05:44,651 --> 00:05:45,931
Let's get moving! Move! Move!

28
00:05:46,091 --> 00:05:48,691
Get off that chair,
you stupid bitch! Let's go!

29
00:05:49,651 --> 00:05:51,411
Get off the phone!
Put the phone down!

30
00:05:51,571 --> 00:05:53,651
You people move forward!
Move! Move! Move!

31
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:54,811
Get out your phones!

32
00:05:54,971 --> 00:05:56,651
Get out your cell phones!
In the bag!

33
00:06:00,852 --> 00:06:03,092
That you don't wanna do.

34
00:06:13,012 --> 00:06:15,413
Shut the fuck up.

35
00:06:15,733 --> 00:06:18,733
Oh, y'all picked the wrong day
not to use the ATM.

36
00:06:18,893 --> 00:06:20,853
Get down.

37
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:23,493
Do what you're told when you're told..

38
00:06:23,653 --> 00:06:25,493
you may live.

39
00:06:25,653 --> 00:06:27,213
But I make no guarantees.

40
00:06:34,014 --> 00:06:35,854
- I'm in.
- You, up.

41
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:38,294
- You, out.
- Let's go. Move.

42
00:06:38,454 --> 00:06:41,734
Your security system, you can
electronically seal off the entrances.

43
00:06:41,894 --> 00:06:43,894
Yes. Right away.

44
00:06:44,854 --> 00:06:46,614
Fabulous.
Oh, what a wonderful attitude.

45
00:06:46,774 --> 00:06:49,015
You and I are gonna
get along just fine.

46
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:01,975
It's done.

47
00:07:02,135 --> 00:07:04,976
- We're locked down.
- Smashing.

48
00:07:26,777 --> 00:07:28,537
Gonna be late for work.

49
00:07:47,618 --> 00:07:49,298
Fire in the hole!

50
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:03,379
- What do you think you're doing?
- Fucker set off the alarm.

51
00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:07,259
Don't you think it would have made
sense to shoot him before he set it off?

52
00:08:07,419 --> 00:08:09,019
Probably.

53
00:08:09,179 --> 00:08:12,140
Jesus. All right.
The alarm's been tripped.

54
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,940
We're on a clock.
Let's get these people out of here.

55
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:18,100
Next time, if you're gonna
do something, do it right.

56
00:08:33,781 --> 00:08:35,501
This is Detective Galloway.

57
00:08:47,422 --> 00:08:50,222
Gonna have to go back that way, sir.
Back that way.

58
00:08:54,302 --> 00:08:57,302
I want all points of entry
identified and covered.

59
00:08:58,182 --> 00:09:01,783
Nina, you need SWAT here now.
Have emergency crews standing by.

60
00:09:01,943 --> 00:09:03,263
Didn't take them long.

61
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,103
Come on, man.

62
00:09:07,743 --> 00:09:10,183
- Set a perimeter. Move them back.
- How far?

63
00:09:10,343 --> 00:09:11,343
Portland.

64
00:09:18,944 --> 00:09:20,064
Detective Callo.

65
00:09:28,864 --> 00:09:30,624
Hey. Got him on the line.

66
00:09:37,025 --> 00:09:39,985
- We're on.
- This is Detective Callo, Seattle P.D.

67
00:09:40,145 --> 00:09:41,825
- Who am I speaking to?
- No questions.

68
00:09:41,985 --> 00:09:44,985
I'm in control of this facility now.
Complete control.

69
00:09:45,145 --> 00:09:47,545
Nobody gets in or out
without my say.

70
00:09:47,705 --> 00:09:49,665
I will execute
every man, woman and child..

71
00:09:49,825 --> 00:09:51,066
if my needs are not met.

72
00:09:51,226 --> 00:09:53,546
All right, don't test me.

73
00:09:53,706 --> 00:09:56,306
- I'm a man of zero tolerance today.
- I'm listening.

74
00:09:56,466 --> 00:09:59,026
All right. Well, try not to
screw this up, huh, detective?

75
00:09:59,186 --> 00:10:02,746
I only have one demand,
and one demand only.

76
00:10:20,307 --> 00:10:22,267
Do you have a warrant?

77
00:10:22,427 --> 00:10:24,068
I need to speak to you, Quentin.

78
00:10:24,228 --> 00:10:27,548
That's where you're shit out of luck,
because I don't need to speak to you.

79
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:29,028
It's important.

80
00:10:37,588 --> 00:10:38,748
Do you live in a barn?

81
00:10:40,309 --> 00:10:42,549
That's Detective Shane Dekker.

82
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:44,989
Doesn't look like much of a detective.

83
00:10:45,149 --> 00:10:46,749
I could say the same about you.

84
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:50,629
- Charming.
- Shane just transferred from Tacoma.

85
00:10:50,789 --> 00:10:53,349
- You might be interested to know..
- Save your breath.

86
00:10:53,509 --> 00:10:54,749
I really don't care.

87
00:10:56,229 --> 00:10:59,110
Just get to what's on your mind.

88
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:02,590
We got a hostage situation
over at American Global..

89
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:06,430
and he won't talk
to anybody but you.

90
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:10,070
- No shit?
- No shit.

91
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:11,670
So we need you to do this.

92
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:13,111
Why should I?

93
00:11:13,271 --> 00:11:15,511
Because people's lives are at risk.

94
00:11:15,671 --> 00:11:17,631
Yeah, like the kid said.

95
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:21,871
Say I did wanna help, I'm suspended.
Or did that slip your mind?

96
00:11:22,031 --> 00:11:25,031
Well, as of right now,
you are back on the force.

97
00:11:25,191 --> 00:11:27,591
- Just like that.
- Just like that.

98
00:11:27,751 --> 00:11:31,952
I won't, however, unleash you alone.

99
00:11:32,112 --> 00:11:33,832
Always a catch.

100
00:11:33,992 --> 00:11:35,432
Shane here is your new partner.

101
00:11:35,592 --> 00:11:39,112
You can consider him
a younger version of me.

102
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:42,992
How nice.

103
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:46,793
- You'd have been with your partner..
- Ex-partner.

104
00:11:48,433 --> 00:11:51,193
On the unemployment
line long time ago.

105
00:11:51,353 --> 00:11:54,313
You know, for a moment,
I thought you cared.

106
00:11:57,033 --> 00:11:58,753
Where are you going?

107
00:12:22,955 --> 00:12:25,675
Yep. I'm here now.
I'll let you know.

108
00:12:32,355 --> 00:12:35,595
- Could we have a few words?
- Yeah. I'll give you two: Blow me.

109
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,436
Need a follow-up comment,
let me know.

110
00:12:39,956 --> 00:12:42,076
- Terrific.
- Talked to him about 9:30.

111
00:12:42,236 --> 00:12:45,076
Nine-thirty. All right, 9:30. Okay.

112
00:12:45,236 --> 00:12:46,916
Teddy, Vincent, nice to see you both.

113
00:12:47,076 --> 00:12:52,196
Okay, so Conners has been reinstated
to full active duty, and it's his scene.

114
00:12:52,356 --> 00:12:54,477
Last time this guy headed
a hostage situation..

115
00:12:54,637 --> 00:12:55,917
an innocent civilian died.

116
00:12:56,077 --> 00:12:57,877
I was not responsible.

117
00:12:58,037 --> 00:12:59,597
Well, you never are.

118
00:12:59,757 --> 00:13:03,277
That girl would be alive today
if it wasn't for your cowboy antics.

119
00:13:03,437 --> 00:13:04,437
You destroy lives.

120
00:13:04,597 --> 00:13:06,997
Well, look who's talking
about destroying lives.

121
00:13:07,157 --> 00:13:09,798
I seem to remember that's
your fucking specialty, Callo.

122
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:11,438
Ladies, please.

123
00:13:12,918 --> 00:13:15,438
I was first on the scene,
and I have seniority.

124
00:13:15,598 --> 00:13:18,238
- Decision's been made, Bernie.
- Don't do this, Martin.

125
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:20,118
Don't cave in to this guy.

126
00:13:20,278 --> 00:13:22,678
Bernie, I need you to take a hike.

127
00:13:22,838 --> 00:13:24,518
All right? We'll talk about it later.

128
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:32,319
Fine.

129
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:35,239
I'll watch the train wreck from home.

130
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:36,839
Bye, Bernie.

131
00:13:36,999 --> 00:13:39,519
Okay, SWAT,
because of special circumstances..

132
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:41,599
we'll defer to Conners.

133
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,680
He's in charge.

134
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,160
First I heard SWAT defer to anyone.

135
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,520
Now, I want you to do the folks
in the bank a big favor..

136
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,880
by proving me very wrong
about you, okay?

137
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,440
Oh, that's an order.

138
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,641
Anything questionable happens today,
I wanna know about it, okay?

139
00:14:00,801 --> 00:14:02,281
Yes, sir.

140
00:14:03,601 --> 00:14:06,401
Looks like you got yourself
a babysitter.

141
00:14:23,922 --> 00:14:26,922
We have approximately
four to seven heavily armed men..

142
00:14:27,082 --> 00:14:29,402
holding an unspecified
number of customers..

143
00:14:29,562 --> 00:14:30,762
and employees hostage.

144
00:14:30,922 --> 00:14:33,003
You're just a wealth of knowledge,
Vincent.

145
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:35,723
Their only demand so far
has been to speak to you.

146
00:14:36,723 --> 00:14:39,123
Get me a line into the bank.
Let's see what they want.

147
00:14:39,283 --> 00:14:40,563
Okay.

148
00:14:52,884 --> 00:14:54,324
Well, well, well.

149
00:14:54,484 --> 00:14:57,284
If it isn't Detective Conners.

150
00:14:57,444 --> 00:14:58,484
Who am I speaking with?

151
00:14:58,644 --> 00:15:00,884
Well, for now, call me Lorenz.

152
00:15:01,604 --> 00:15:03,444
Okay, Lorenz. How we doing in there?

153
00:15:03,604 --> 00:15:05,925
Get you anything?
Food, medical supplies perhaps?

154
00:15:06,085 --> 00:15:08,165
We heard an explosion.

155
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:10,765
Everyone who matters is fine.

156
00:15:10,925 --> 00:15:14,325
Of course, I would have preferred
the authorities not be involved at all..

157
00:15:14,485 --> 00:15:17,685
but since Seattle's finest
needs a presence on the scene..

158
00:15:17,845 --> 00:15:19,445
I'm glad it's you.

159
00:15:19,605 --> 00:15:22,486
- Oh, well. My fame precedes me.
- Don't be flattered.

160
00:15:22,646 --> 00:15:25,726
I needed to have someone who's been
through this experience before..

161
00:15:25,886 --> 00:15:31,526
because, detective,
I plan on living a long, full, rich life.

162
00:15:31,686 --> 00:15:35,286
However, I am surprised
that they found you so quickly.

163
00:15:35,446 --> 00:15:38,686
- I thought you were suspended.
- I was.

164
00:15:38,846 --> 00:15:41,047
But I'm back. Your information's old.

165
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:43,607
You never get what you pay for.

166
00:15:45,007 --> 00:15:47,127
Well, I guess you wanna know
about the hostages?

167
00:15:47,287 --> 00:15:48,447
Yes.

168
00:15:48,607 --> 00:15:53,047
There's approximately 40,
and they're doing just swell.

169
00:15:53,207 --> 00:15:55,247
Well, all of them except one.

170
00:15:56,048 --> 00:15:57,128
Someone's dead?

171
00:15:57,288 --> 00:16:01,928
Theory put to practice
isn't always perfect.

172
00:16:02,088 --> 00:16:06,128
You can't keep the hostages in check
if you let a bad deed go unpunished.

173
00:16:06,288 --> 00:16:08,968
They might just randomly revolt.

174
00:16:09,128 --> 00:16:12,369
Chaos has some order to it.

175
00:16:12,529 --> 00:16:14,969
What else will I be looking for?

176
00:16:15,129 --> 00:16:16,369
Demands.

177
00:16:16,529 --> 00:16:19,929
Wouldn't be too much to ask for you
and your colleagues just to bounce?

178
00:16:20,089 --> 00:16:21,449
Safe to say.

179
00:16:21,609 --> 00:16:25,049
All right. Well, you just stay
by the phone, and I'll.. 
I'll contact you.

180
00:16:25,209 --> 00:16:26,969
- Hey, wait, Lorenz.
- Don't worry.

181
00:16:27,129 --> 00:16:30,010
I don't have any plans
until sunrise tomorrow.

182
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:33,410
Relax. It's gonna be a long one.

183
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:36,490
Hey, come on, Lorenz.
This conversation's not finished.

184
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:39,490
Patience, detective. Patience.

185
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:42,810
We don't want this to be another
Pearl Street Bridge, now, do we?

186
00:16:49,491 --> 00:16:51,371
He's out.

187
00:16:52,651 --> 00:16:55,371
This standoff
is reaching two hours now.

188
00:16:55,531 --> 00:16:59,051
We've been told detectives have
made contact with the perpetrators..

189
00:16:59,211 --> 00:17:02,212
but whether specific demands
have been made, we cannot confirm.

190
00:17:02,372 --> 00:17:04,292
When we're in the know,
we'll let you know.

191
00:17:04,452 --> 00:17:07,452
I'm Karen Cross live
for Channel 2 news.

192
00:17:28,133 --> 00:17:30,053
Where's our fearless captain?

193
00:17:30,213 --> 00:17:32,253
He went uptown to brief
the commissioner.

194
00:17:32,413 --> 00:17:34,293
And you're here in his place.

195
00:17:39,574 --> 00:17:41,454
- What's that?
- Nicotine gum.

196
00:17:41,614 --> 00:17:44,614
- You quit smoking?
- Caffeine, too, if you must know.

197
00:17:44,774 --> 00:17:47,374
- What? A man's capable of change.
- Yeah.

198
00:17:47,534 --> 00:17:52,855
- Don't worry. I still have a vice or two.
- Detective, 15 rings. No answer.

199
00:17:53,015 --> 00:17:55,135
Try again in five.

200
00:17:55,295 --> 00:17:58,015
- What are they doing in there?
- Wasting our fucking time.

201
00:18:02,455 --> 00:18:04,375
Precisely.

202
00:18:04,535 --> 00:18:07,615
He knows police protocol, not to
mention the shit in our own precinct.

203
00:18:07,775 --> 00:18:09,056
He's disguising his voice.

204
00:18:09,216 --> 00:18:11,776
Probably means he's got a record
and has done this before.

205
00:18:11,936 --> 00:18:13,696
Dropped that hint about sunrise.

206
00:18:13,856 --> 00:18:15,776
He's buying time.

207
00:18:16,776 --> 00:18:18,856
- Why?
- He's trying to figure out his move.

208
00:18:19,016 --> 00:18:21,736
- He wasn't expecting us.
- He wasn't expecting you.

209
00:18:21,896 --> 00:18:23,616
He said he thought
you were suspended.

210
00:18:23,776 --> 00:18:26,977
Probably thought it'd take all day
to find me, giving him time he needs.

211
00:18:27,137 --> 00:18:29,697
- He's stalling.
- He almost has what he came for.

212
00:18:29,857 --> 00:18:30,937
We're going in.

213
00:18:33,217 --> 00:18:37,097
- Where is the SWAT commander?
- I'll find him.

214
00:18:37,257 --> 00:18:39,737
That's a big call.
You thought about what you're doing?

215
00:18:39,897 --> 00:18:44,378
- Are you questioning me, Teddy?
- Unfortunately, yeah.

216
00:18:44,538 --> 00:18:46,778
Well, I question how you can fuck
that asshole..

217
00:18:46,938 --> 00:18:49,378
and still manage
to look in the mirror.

218
00:18:50,418 --> 00:18:52,618
Look, the hostages
are in imminent danger.

219
00:18:52,778 --> 00:18:56,258
They've confessed to killing. That's
an automatic murder-one charge,

220
00:18:56,418 --> 00:18:58,339
Life sentence,
a needle for all of them.

221
00:18:58,499 --> 00:19:00,859
So why keep witnesses around
to testify?

222
00:19:01,019 --> 00:19:05,379
The longer we wait, the greater
the risk. We need to go in. Now.

223
00:19:05,539 --> 00:19:06,699
Quentin.

224
00:19:10,339 --> 00:19:11,899
- So, what we got?
- Snipers up top.

225
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:13,699
Ten soldiers on the ground.

226
00:19:13,859 --> 00:19:16,180
- What's the best way in?
- Tear gas. Blow the doors.

227
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:18,340
Hey, hold on. No explosives.

228
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,940
We got 40 civilians in there.
It's too great a chance.

229
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,380
Any other way?

230
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,020
No. There's no pussy way in.

231
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,780
The doors are locked electronically
from the inside..

232
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,740
and we ain't getting in
without force.

233
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:33,221
What if we cut the power?
That'll disable the system.

234
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:36,621
We can open the locks manually,
go in that way.

235
00:19:36,781 --> 00:19:38,661
That'll work.

236
00:19:38,821 --> 00:19:41,501
So we'll take the pussy way in,
commander.

237
00:19:41,661 --> 00:19:45,341
Cut the power
and we go in at 11:15 sharp.

238
00:19:50,662 --> 00:19:53,782
The banks are equipped with
generators. Once the power's down..

239
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:57,102
they'll kick back on
in approximately three to six minutes.

240
00:19:57,262 --> 00:19:58,942
Be over before then.

241
00:19:59,102 --> 00:20:02,262
- Commander, your men in position?
- Standing by.

242
00:20:02,422 --> 00:20:03,982
Call for the power to be cut.

243
00:20:04,142 --> 00:20:06,063
Once down, wait for my signal.

244
00:20:06,223 --> 00:20:09,983
Nobody moves until I give the go.
Understood?

245
00:20:10,143 --> 00:20:11,783
Yep.

246
00:20:19,183 --> 00:20:20,903
You, come here.

247
00:20:21,063 --> 00:20:22,144
Come here.

248
00:20:22,584 --> 00:20:24,904
Come on. Get up.

249
00:20:25,704 --> 00:20:27,784
No!

250
00:20:31,264 --> 00:20:33,664
Will you just shut the fuck up?

251
00:20:44,265 --> 00:20:47,305
Here they come.

252
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,065
Stand still. I said don't move.

253
00:20:57,866 --> 00:20:59,426
Okay, let's go around the horn.

254
00:21:00,466 --> 00:21:02,346
- One, check.
- Two, check.

255
00:21:02,506 --> 00:21:05,346
- Three, check.
- Four, check.

256
00:21:08,386 --> 00:21:09,826
Here we go.

257
00:21:09,986 --> 00:21:11,547
Cut the power.

258
00:21:13,907 --> 00:21:15,427
What?

259
00:21:17,627 --> 00:21:18,907
Now.

260
00:21:22,187 --> 00:21:24,747
Hey, hold on. Hold on.
What just happened?

261
00:21:27,147 --> 00:21:28,948
Holy shit.

262
00:21:32,748 --> 00:21:36,108
Shit. Come on, guys.
Let's get a move on.

263
00:21:36,268 --> 00:21:39,108
- We're moving in.
- Stand the fuck down, commander.

264
00:21:39,268 --> 00:21:41,708
- It's a trap.
- No, you stand the fuck down.

265
00:21:41,868 --> 00:21:45,069
- This is my show now.
- Repeat, do not go in.

266
00:21:45,229 --> 00:21:49,589
On my count. Three, two, one.

267
00:21:49,749 --> 00:21:51,109
Move!

268
00:22:00,269 --> 00:22:01,390
Go!

269
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:35,632
Round up all the hostages!

270
00:22:35,792 --> 00:22:38,832
Anyone that comes out, you grab
them! Every single one of them!

271
00:22:38,992 --> 00:22:40,752
Got the emergency crews over here.

272
00:22:42,032 --> 00:22:43,392
Secure the area.

273
00:22:44,832 --> 00:22:47,152
Medics! Paramedics here!

274
00:22:47,312 --> 00:22:49,672
Anyone in the bank!

275
00:24:11,157 --> 00:24:13,597
- You see anybody come your way?
- No. No one went by us.

276
00:24:13,757 --> 00:24:18,678
Detectives, we found these.
Gloves, masks, vests.

277
00:24:23,158 --> 00:24:26,278
We let them walk right past us.

278
00:24:28,878 --> 00:24:30,959
Fucking beautiful.

279
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,960
Okay, we.. We got the one teller dead.

280
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:53,680
The two that were strung up, they're
alive, but they're in critical condition.

281
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,080
Few of the SWAT took burns,
but that's the worst of it.

282
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:00,800
Depending on who you talk to, there
was between five and nine perps.

283
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,400
Nobody saw them, because
they were wearing their masks.

284
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,601
I got Dax collecting
all the security tapes..

285
00:25:05,761 --> 00:25:09,041
so that's at least gonna
give us a firm number.

286
00:25:09,321 --> 00:25:11,681
Want background checks
on every hostage.

287
00:25:11,841 --> 00:25:14,361
They're all suspects until they're not.

288
00:25:15,001 --> 00:25:16,441
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

289
00:25:16,601 --> 00:25:19,281
I need to hear that conversation
between Conners and Lorenz.

290
00:25:19,441 --> 00:25:21,082
- Well, you'll have to wait.
- How long?

291
00:25:21,242 --> 00:25:22,242
An hour, maybe more.

292
00:25:22,402 --> 00:25:24,602
Can you show me
how to play it myself?

293
00:25:24,762 --> 00:25:27,042
Now, look, it doesn't work this way,
okay?

294
00:25:27,202 --> 00:25:28,562
I don't take orders from you.

295
00:25:28,722 --> 00:25:31,082
I don't know you
and no one touches my stuff, okay?

296
00:25:31,242 --> 00:25:33,682
You'll have to wait. Excuse me.

297
00:25:34,842 --> 00:25:36,042
What the..?

298
00:25:36,202 --> 00:25:38,203
What the hell are you doing?
Are you ADD?

299
00:25:38,363 --> 00:25:41,403
Along with whatever they stole
and this war zone they left behind..

300
00:25:41,563 --> 00:25:43,723
a man's dead
and the killers are running free.

301
00:25:43,883 --> 00:25:47,603
I don't have time to wait. I'll figure
it out myself. Thank you for your help.

302
00:25:47,883 --> 00:25:50,603
Okay, wait. No. Just.. No, no, no.

303
00:25:50,763 --> 00:25:53,724
This is a dat recorder. You know what
that is? Digital audio-tape.

304
00:25:53,884 --> 00:25:56,724
It's just like a regular tape player,
right? Play, stop, rewind.

305
00:25:56,884 --> 00:26:00,124
The headphones jack straight in.

306
00:26:00,284 --> 00:26:02,404
Tape's already inside. All right?

307
00:26:02,564 --> 00:26:04,724
That wasn't so hard, was it?

308
00:26:07,004 --> 00:26:09,684
Just don't break anything, okay?

309
00:26:27,286 --> 00:26:31,886
So everyone's been cleared out
at this point except for those two there.

310
00:26:32,046 --> 00:26:33,086
What about this one?

311
00:26:33,246 --> 00:26:36,206
That's a camera in the vault.
It got blown in the first explosion.

312
00:26:36,366 --> 00:26:40,046
And here comes..

313
00:26:41,406 --> 00:26:42,766
That's when you cut the power.

314
00:26:42,926 --> 00:26:44,847
So we can't ID them.

315
00:26:45,007 --> 00:26:47,807
There's a four minute, 52-second gap
before the image returns.

316
00:26:47,967 --> 00:26:49,687
Yeah. They're long gone by then.

317
00:26:50,247 --> 00:26:52,927
Go to the tapes when they went in.
Document each move made..

318
00:26:53,087 --> 00:26:54,847
for the two hours they were inside.

319
00:26:55,647 --> 00:26:57,847
Oh, hey. Awful lot of news cameras
outside.

320
00:26:58,007 --> 00:27:00,608
Maybe one got a good look
at them coming out.

321
00:27:00,768 --> 00:27:02,448
Have Vincent check it out.

322
00:27:03,208 --> 00:27:06,288
Conners, better come out here.

323
00:27:10,288 --> 00:27:11,328
Oh, shit.

324
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,728
Feds.

325
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:16,048
Detective Conners.

326
00:27:16,208 --> 00:27:17,569
Join us, would you?

327
00:27:17,729 --> 00:27:18,849
Someone's dead?

328
00:27:19,009 --> 00:27:23,049
Theory put to practice
isn't always perfect.

329
00:27:23,209 --> 00:27:25,409
You can't expect
to keep the hostages in check..

330
00:27:25,569 --> 00:27:27,329
if you let a bad deed
go unpunished.

331
00:27:27,489 --> 00:27:30,209
They might just randomly revolt.

332
00:27:30,369 --> 00:27:33,089
Chaos has some order to it.

333
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:41,210
Prince Amar Al-Aban is one of the
wealthiest and least popular Arabs..

334
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:45,610
in the Middle East. There's been
threats, but for better or worse..

335
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:47,490
he's an ally to the United States.

336
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:49,450
Last month in Charlotte,
North Carolina..

337
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:51,331
the Crown Valley Bank was hit.

338
00:27:51,491 --> 00:27:53,291
Prince had a safe-deposit box
there too.

339
00:27:53,451 --> 00:27:56,051
- So, what was in the box?
- We don't keep records.

340
00:27:56,211 --> 00:27:57,811
Boxes are private.

341
00:27:57,971 --> 00:28:01,251
Since 9/11, we screen for
live tissue, viruses and explosives.

342
00:28:01,411 --> 00:28:03,291
If it passes those tests, we don't ask.

343
00:28:03,451 --> 00:28:06,091
Look, this is fascinating shit.

344
00:28:06,251 --> 00:28:07,652
What about the money?

345
00:28:07,812 --> 00:28:09,812
Bank robbers still like cash,
don't they?

346
00:28:09,972 --> 00:28:12,092
Cash drawers don't appear
to be touched.

347
00:28:12,252 --> 00:28:13,492
Neither does the cash vault.

348
00:28:13,652 --> 00:28:15,972
So they broke into a bank
and didn't steal any money?

349
00:28:16,132 --> 00:28:19,452
We believe the prince's box was the
target. We're trying to reach him now.

350
00:28:19,612 --> 00:28:21,852
Sir, may I have a word with you,
please?

351
00:28:22,012 --> 00:28:24,093
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

352
00:28:31,573 --> 00:28:33,173
I'm curious.

353
00:28:33,333 --> 00:28:39,333
Are you familiar with the term
"franchise-sized fuckup"?

354
00:28:39,493 --> 00:28:41,814
What, this is my fault, huh?

355
00:28:42,294 --> 00:28:45,414
I'm beginning to understand why
they wanted to deal directly with you.

356
00:28:45,574 --> 00:28:50,134
You think you're smart, Quentin,
but, man, are you stupid.

357
00:28:50,294 --> 00:28:52,174
- You got played.
- Oh, that's not fair.

358
00:28:52,334 --> 00:28:54,774
Everything was according
to standard procedure.

359
00:28:54,934 --> 00:28:56,775
You came to me. I didn't ask for this.

360
00:28:56,935 --> 00:28:59,735
The commissioner's office
is scrambling to make sense of this.

361
00:28:59,895 --> 00:29:04,775
If they need a scapegoat,
I got zero problem serving you up.

362
00:29:04,935 --> 00:29:06,015
Thought so.

363
00:29:06,175 --> 00:29:08,015
You wanted this to happen.

364
00:29:08,175 --> 00:29:10,695
Good God, I did not.

365
00:29:13,136 --> 00:29:15,216
If it had to be somebody..

366
00:29:17,376 --> 00:29:21,336
Theory put to practice
isn't always perfect.

367
00:29:21,496 --> 00:29:23,656
You can't expect
to keep the hostages in check..

368
00:29:23,816 --> 00:29:25,576
if you let a bad deed
go unpunished.

369
00:29:25,736 --> 00:29:28,496
They might just randomly revolt.

370
00:29:28,656 --> 00:29:32,617
Chaos has some order to it.

371
00:29:47,818 --> 00:29:50,138
I think this Lorenz was
trying to tell us something.

372
00:29:50,298 --> 00:29:52,858
Oh, really? You don't say.

373
00:29:53,018 --> 00:29:57,258
The way he spoke.
He paused before certain words.

374
00:29:57,418 --> 00:29:59,578
Have you ever heard
of the chaos theory?

375
00:29:59,738 --> 00:30:03,219
Edward Lorenz invented
the chaos theory in the 1960s.

376
00:30:03,379 --> 00:30:05,579
It's the study of phenomena
that appear random..

377
00:30:05,739 --> 00:30:07,499
but have an element of regularity..

378
00:30:07,659 --> 00:30:09,659
which can be described
mathematically.

379
00:30:09,819 --> 00:30:11,179
Try that again.

380
00:30:11,339 --> 00:30:15,819
Pretty much, initial state of events
may seem unrelated and random..

381
00:30:15,979 --> 00:30:17,699
but eventually a pattern emerges..

382
00:30:17,859 --> 00:30:20,620
and in the end,
all the pieces fit together.

383
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:22,540
Anything else, officers?

384
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,980
No, that'll be all. Thanks.

385
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,940
So you're a college boy.

386
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,140
Which one?

387
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,540
Someplace I've heard of..

388
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:34,380
or one of those inbred
state schools no one's heard of?

389
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,500
U. Dub.

390
00:30:36,621 --> 00:30:38,301
So it's the latter.

391
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:40,501
How'd you end up on the force?

392
00:30:40,661 --> 00:30:42,421
It's kind of the family business.

393
00:30:42,581 --> 00:30:44,741
Oh, your dad's dad and so on back?

394
00:30:44,901 --> 00:30:47,581
Listen, do we really need
all this "get to know you" crap?

395
00:30:47,741 --> 00:30:49,661
Couple of hours ago,
you didn't give a shit.

396
00:30:49,821 --> 00:30:51,181
You've grown on me.

397
00:30:51,341 --> 00:30:54,662
Besides, I'm entrusting my life to you.
I should know something about you.

398
00:30:54,822 --> 00:30:57,062
I would think you'd like to know
a little about me.

399
00:30:57,222 --> 00:30:59,862
I know about you, detective.
Everyone does.

400
00:31:00,022 --> 00:31:02,302
You don't say that
with much enthusiasm.

401
00:31:02,742 --> 00:31:06,102
Not much to be enthusiastic about.

402
00:31:06,662 --> 00:31:08,782
Listen, my reputation
often precedes me.

403
00:31:08,942 --> 00:31:13,703
You, however, have no reputation
at all, a fact I need to deal with.

404
00:31:13,863 --> 00:31:17,063
If you've been through the shit I have,
then you can judge me.

405
00:31:17,223 --> 00:31:20,543
Now, we can try to work together
and make the best of a bad situation..

406
00:31:20,703 --> 00:31:23,663
or we can compare
dick sizes all day.

407
00:31:23,823 --> 00:31:25,103
It's up to you.

408
00:31:25,263 --> 00:31:29,744
Since this is your first day here,
today, mine's bigger.

409
00:31:31,824 --> 00:31:33,344
Conners, come in.

410
00:31:34,504 --> 00:31:35,944
Go ahead.

411
00:31:36,104 --> 00:31:38,624
I got something
you're gonna wanna see.

412
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:43,825
Lastly, I don't like the Pac 10.

413
00:31:44,825 --> 00:31:46,145
It's overrated.

414
00:32:01,386 --> 00:32:03,186
Come over and see this.

415
00:32:04,626 --> 00:32:06,866
Detective. Just can't stay away
from me, can you?

416
00:32:07,026 --> 00:32:08,786
Can you roll, please?

417
00:32:09,666 --> 00:32:11,826
Yeah, Okay. Right there. Perfect.

418
00:32:11,986 --> 00:32:13,826
Damon Richards.

419
00:32:13,986 --> 00:32:16,307
Career loser. I busted him
a couple years ago..

420
00:32:16,467 --> 00:32:19,307
on attempted robbery.
Stupid bastard never learns.

421
00:32:19,467 --> 00:32:21,227
What's he doing back on the streets?

422
00:32:21,387 --> 00:32:23,667
He gave up his partners
and cut a deal with the D.A.

423
00:32:23,827 --> 00:32:24,867
Got an address?

424
00:32:25,027 --> 00:32:27,787
The only thing on file's in Spokane,
but I think I remember..

425
00:32:27,947 --> 00:32:30,387
that he had a girlfriend in town.
Gina, I think.

426
00:32:35,068 --> 00:32:38,188
Gina, it's the police. Open up.

427
00:32:43,028 --> 00:32:44,748
Step back. Now.

428
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:16,150
Gun!

429
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:20,710
Shots fired. Officer down.
We need an ambulance and backup.

430
00:33:23,311 --> 00:33:24,631
Oh, shit.

431
00:33:24,791 --> 00:33:26,831
Are you hit?

432
00:33:26,991 --> 00:33:28,151
I'm fine.

433
00:33:55,312 --> 00:33:56,313
I got her.

434
00:33:56,473 --> 00:33:58,433
I got her. Stop, Gina.

435
00:33:58,593 --> 00:33:59,593
Teddy!

436
00:33:59,753 --> 00:34:01,833
- You like that, huh?
- Yeah.

437
00:34:29,435 --> 00:34:30,915
I'm a police officer.

438
00:34:32,795 --> 00:34:35,315
That guy's a murder suspect.
I need your bike.

439
00:34:35,475 --> 00:34:36,635
What?

440
00:34:37,955 --> 00:34:40,635
Go ahead, dude. It's all yours, man.

441
00:35:06,277 --> 00:35:07,957
Look out!

442
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:49,199
Son of a bitch.

443
00:37:18,165 --> 00:37:19,805
I want my fucking lawyer.

444
00:37:19,965 --> 00:37:21,405
Fuck your lawyer.

445
00:37:52,247 --> 00:37:55,927
He's unconscious but stable,
with a nice knot on his forehead.

446
00:37:56,087 --> 00:37:58,727
- Three officers are watching the room.
- He wakes, they call.

447
00:37:58,887 --> 00:38:02,447
Hey, Quincy, come on.
Give it a rest. I'm fine.

448
00:38:02,607 --> 00:38:04,807
Quincy was a coroner.

449
00:38:05,288 --> 00:38:07,608
You might be bruised,
but you may have a cracked rib.

450
00:38:07,768 --> 00:38:09,048
You should get to a hospital.

451
00:38:09,208 --> 00:38:11,048
Should do a lot of things.

452
00:38:15,048 --> 00:38:17,048
You sure you're all right?

453
00:38:17,208 --> 00:38:18,688
I'm fine.

454
00:38:19,208 --> 00:38:23,769
Gina Lopez, 28, done time
for possession, has two kids.

455
00:38:23,929 --> 00:38:24,929
Am I interrupting?

456
00:38:27,009 --> 00:38:28,489
No.

457
00:38:28,649 --> 00:38:30,169
Excuse me.

458
00:38:30,329 --> 00:38:33,089
Gina claims she doesn't know
anything about a bank robbery.

459
00:38:33,249 --> 00:38:34,809
Of course she doesn't.

460
00:38:34,969 --> 00:38:37,329
- Vincent.
- Yeah?

461
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:40,330
Have them put Miss Lopez..

462
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:42,690
in interrogation one
and turn the AC on full.

463
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:44,930
Let me know when her nipples
can cut glass.

464
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:46,330
Sorry, detective. I didn't..

465
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,730
When we first met,
I didn't realize who you were.

466
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:52,810
I worked with your dad briefly
right after I got out of the academy.

467
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:54,330
It was an honor.

468
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:55,691
Thanks, Vincent.

469
00:38:55,851 --> 00:38:57,331
Father was Harry Dekker.

470
00:38:57,491 --> 00:38:59,531
Detectives, ready for you.

471
00:39:05,491 --> 00:39:07,851
Somebody going on a trip?

472
00:39:08,011 --> 00:39:10,051
Looks like it, don't it?

473
00:39:10,211 --> 00:39:12,012
You're looking well, Marnie.

474
00:39:12,172 --> 00:39:14,732
Heard you were back, Conners.
Keep dreaming.

475
00:39:14,892 --> 00:39:17,772
You, on the other hand:

476
00:39:17,932 --> 00:39:20,612
- Hi. Marnie.
- Shane.

477
00:39:20,772 --> 00:39:24,932
You know, I got a bike myself.
Maybe we can go for a ride.

478
00:39:25,092 --> 00:39:26,492
Or maybe I could just ride you.

479
00:39:28,813 --> 00:39:31,413
Can we get back to work now,
please?

480
00:39:32,333 --> 00:39:36,533
We have passport, suntan lotion,
Bermuda shorts, thong bikini..

481
00:39:36,693 --> 00:39:38,173
Hopefully hers.

482
00:39:38,333 --> 00:39:42,093
And this.

483
00:39:45,614 --> 00:39:48,774
Must be 50 large, his cut.

484
00:39:48,934 --> 00:39:51,494
- You'd think, right?
- It's not?

485
00:39:51,654 --> 00:39:55,854
Well, don't put words in my mouth,
but two things jump out at me here.

486
00:39:56,014 --> 00:39:58,334
First of all, every bank
has their own money bands..

487
00:39:58,494 --> 00:40:00,174
and these are not
American Global's.

488
00:40:00,334 --> 00:40:03,215
After checking, we find they belong
to World National Financial.

489
00:40:03,375 --> 00:40:06,055
- Sounds familiar.
- Months ago, half a million dollars..

490
00:40:06,215 --> 00:40:09,255
was stolen in an armed robbery
there, smash-and-grab job.

491
00:40:09,415 --> 00:40:11,935
But they caught the guys.
They recovered about 400,000.

492
00:40:12,095 --> 00:40:16,055
Now, they've been in jail ever since
and their trials are still pending..

493
00:40:16,215 --> 00:40:20,176
so that brings me
to point number two.

494
00:40:21,616 --> 00:40:23,136
Smell that.

495
00:40:24,336 --> 00:40:26,216
- What is that?
- When evidence comes in..

496
00:40:26,376 --> 00:40:28,936
any physical contact
can make it hard to lift prints..

497
00:40:29,096 --> 00:40:30,416
so now to mark the bills..

498
00:40:30,576 --> 00:40:32,816
we spray a scented
solution directly on them.

499
00:40:32,976 --> 00:40:35,377
- Is that new?
- Yeah. Wave of the future.

500
00:40:35,537 --> 00:40:38,217
You try and keep up with the times,
eh, Conners?

501
00:40:38,377 --> 00:40:40,537
So this money's not from our bank.

502
00:40:40,697 --> 00:40:43,657
Oh, no. No, this money's from
the World National Financial job..

503
00:40:43,817 --> 00:40:45,417
and our evidence room.

504
00:40:51,818 --> 00:40:54,898
For a list of things
you can put in my mouth.

505
00:40:55,058 --> 00:40:56,658
Conners.

506
00:41:01,938 --> 00:41:04,978
Do you remember who headed up
the World National case?

507
00:41:05,138 --> 00:41:08,019
I think it was Callo.

508
00:41:08,179 --> 00:41:09,299
Why?

509
00:41:09,459 --> 00:41:12,499
Oh, no reason.
Just thinking out loud. Come on.

510
00:41:16,179 --> 00:41:20,379
When you said it was your family
business, I didn't realize.

511
00:41:20,539 --> 00:41:22,939
Guess I just didn't connect the dots.

512
00:41:23,579 --> 00:41:25,900
Don't worry about it.

513
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:28,180
Your father was a hero.

514
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:31,620
Yes, he was.

515
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:38,020
First I thought maybe you
were related to the captain.

516
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:42,021
No. No relation.

517
00:41:56,901 --> 00:41:58,382
We found the money, Gina.

518
00:41:59,542 --> 00:42:00,982
The money was Damon's.

519
00:42:01,142 --> 00:42:03,262
That money came
from our evidence room.

520
00:42:03,422 --> 00:42:05,942
I told you, I know nothing
about a bank robbery.

521
00:42:06,102 --> 00:42:09,702
Whatever Damon was into,
I know nothing about.

522
00:42:09,862 --> 00:42:12,062
So where were you going?

523
00:42:12,222 --> 00:42:13,462
Vacation.

524
00:42:13,622 --> 00:42:16,223
This isn't possession
or solicitation, Gina.

525
00:42:16,383 --> 00:42:17,863
This is felony murder one.

526
00:42:18,023 --> 00:42:20,663
If you're protecting him,
you'd get life.

527
00:42:20,823 --> 00:42:22,183
I didn't do nothing.

528
00:42:22,343 --> 00:42:23,663
It's "I didn't do anything."

529
00:42:23,823 --> 00:42:27,783
"Didn't do nothing" is a
double negative, infers the positive.

530
00:42:27,943 --> 00:42:30,263
The grammar
in this country's terrible.

531
00:42:30,423 --> 00:42:32,984
Look, this isn't going away.
You wanna walk out of here..

532
00:42:33,144 --> 00:42:35,624
with some semblance of a life,
you tell me something.

533
00:42:35,784 --> 00:42:38,984
I'm done talking.
I want a lawyer now.

534
00:42:41,624 --> 00:42:43,824
Fine. Then it's two phone calls
I'll make.

535
00:42:43,984 --> 00:42:46,104
The first to the
public defender's office.

536
00:42:46,264 --> 00:42:48,185
The second will be
to children's services.

537
00:42:49,665 --> 00:42:50,905
What?

538
00:42:51,065 --> 00:42:53,865
Simple. You insist on a lawyer,
I'll take your kids.

539
00:42:54,025 --> 00:42:57,905
Wait. You can't take my kids
away from me.

540
00:42:58,065 --> 00:43:01,625
What do you care? You were ready
to fly the coop with shit-for-brains.

541
00:43:01,785 --> 00:43:03,745
Fuck you!
You can't treat me like this!

542
00:43:03,905 --> 00:43:05,026
I have rights, you know.

543
00:43:05,186 --> 00:43:06,946
You can't take my children
away from me!

544
00:43:07,106 --> 00:43:08,626
I can and I will.

545
00:43:08,786 --> 00:43:10,586
Just tell me what I wanna know.

546
00:43:16,106 --> 00:43:19,546
- Not exactly useful information.
- You believe her?

547
00:43:19,706 --> 00:43:22,867
I think for the first time in the
girl's life, she's telling the truth.

548
00:43:23,027 --> 00:43:25,347
Once she asked for a lawyer
anything she told us..

549
00:43:25,507 --> 00:43:27,547
would have been inadmissible.

550
00:43:27,707 --> 00:43:30,907
Yeah? Who would've known?
Would've been her word against mine.

551
00:43:31,067 --> 00:43:34,107
And who do you think
the jury would have believed?

552
00:43:34,267 --> 00:43:37,268
Justice by any means,
even if you cross the line?

553
00:43:37,428 --> 00:43:39,948
The only line around here
is the blue line.

554
00:43:40,108 --> 00:43:42,588
You cross that one,
then you got problems.

555
00:43:42,748 --> 00:43:45,308
Ask Callo.
He knows what I'm talking about.

556
00:43:46,428 --> 00:43:48,548
Those serial numbers
Marnie faxed me..

557
00:43:48,708 --> 00:43:51,548
according to our computers,
that money should be downstairs.

558
00:43:51,708 --> 00:43:53,788
Moving on to basketball..

559
00:43:53,949 --> 00:43:58,589
Sonics defeated the Trailblazers
last night, 85 to 72.

560
00:44:02,469 --> 00:44:04,229
Buzz us in.

561
00:44:08,509 --> 00:44:10,029
Gotta sign first.

562
00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:21,030
Heard you were back.

563
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:23,750
Kind of liked not having you around,
Conners.

564
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:25,950
Have another doughnut, Harry.

565
00:44:36,551 --> 00:44:41,471
That fat fuck is the sole guardian of the
city's greatest source of contraband.

566
00:44:41,631 --> 00:44:43,631
Drugs, weapons, cash.

567
00:44:43,792 --> 00:44:47,352
Millions just sitting here for the taking.

568
00:44:47,512 --> 00:44:49,792
Yeah, but you'd have to have
some major firepower..

569
00:44:49,952 --> 00:44:54,112
not to mention an extra-large set of
balls to knock off the police station.

570
00:44:54,272 --> 00:44:56,512
Not if you're a cop.

571
00:44:56,672 --> 00:45:00,993
Could just walk right in and..

572
00:45:02,513 --> 00:45:04,353
take whatever you want.

573
00:45:08,713 --> 00:45:12,953
Here it is. Line 17.

574
00:45:13,793 --> 00:45:14,753
Bernie Callo.

575
00:45:14,913 --> 00:45:17,634
No one takes anything out
of here unless they sign for it.

576
00:45:17,794 --> 00:45:19,554
So, what?
He showed you a warrant, what?

577
00:45:19,714 --> 00:45:21,154
He must've.

578
00:45:21,314 --> 00:45:22,354
He must've.

579
00:45:22,514 --> 00:45:24,314
What, lost your fucking memory,
Harry?

580
00:45:24,474 --> 00:45:27,874
You know how many times someone
signs shit out? I see the same guys.

581
00:45:28,034 --> 00:45:30,594
I can't remember one instance
from two weeks ago.

582
00:45:30,754 --> 00:45:33,635
If that's his signature,
that means he signed for it.

583
00:45:33,795 --> 00:45:35,235
Take it up with him.

584
00:45:37,035 --> 00:45:40,275
The money from Richards' place
traced to the World National heist..

585
00:45:40,435 --> 00:45:42,075
a case Callo headed up.

586
00:45:42,235 --> 00:45:45,315
Bernie signed the money out
of evidence himself two weeks ago.

587
00:45:45,475 --> 00:45:46,515
How much?

588
00:45:46,675 --> 00:45:48,875
Four hundred and thirty-three
thousand dollars..

589
00:45:49,035 --> 00:45:51,916
If it is Callo, it would explain
how they knew police protocol..

590
00:45:52,076 --> 00:45:53,716
and how our department operates.

591
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:55,716
Explains why he was
pissed this morning..

592
00:45:55,876 --> 00:45:57,436
about being replaced by Conners.

593
00:45:57,596 --> 00:45:59,676
He doesn't need another
reason to be pissed.

594
00:45:59,836 --> 00:46:02,116
What about motive?

595
00:46:02,276 --> 00:46:04,316
- Do we have one?
- Pressure.

596
00:46:04,476 --> 00:46:05,916
Could have been getting to him.

597
00:46:06,076 --> 00:46:08,237
He's been getting a big cold shoulder
from cops..

598
00:46:08,397 --> 00:46:10,237
since he testified about Pearl Street.

599
00:46:10,397 --> 00:46:12,837
No. I don't buy that.

600
00:46:14,077 --> 00:46:16,677
He was also getting divorced.

601
00:46:18,637 --> 00:46:21,597
About a month ago, he told me
he and his wife might be splitting..

602
00:46:21,757 --> 00:46:24,478
asked if I knew a lawyer
who wouldn't clean him out.

603
00:46:24,638 --> 00:46:26,758
I didn't think it was this serious.

604
00:46:26,918 --> 00:46:28,718
I don't know. Bernie's a first-rate cop.

605
00:46:28,878 --> 00:46:30,598
He was a boy scout, for chrissake.

606
00:46:30,758 --> 00:46:32,798
This just doesn't
make any sense, guys.

607
00:46:32,958 --> 00:46:34,798
They never do, captain.

608
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:37,478
Come on.
The facts speak for themselves.

609
00:46:37,638 --> 00:46:39,518
No, they don't.

610
00:46:39,678 --> 00:46:41,439
Why, if Callo's involved..?

611
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:44,199
Why didn't they ask
for him at the bank?

612
00:46:47,759 --> 00:46:49,799
Jenkins.

613
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:03,280
And you arrived home at what time?

614
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:07,040
Mrs. Callo, do you feel okay
to continue?

615
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,760
Yes, I'm fine.

616
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:11,800
Just a few more minutes.

617
00:47:16,321 --> 00:47:19,441
Wife came home approximately
45 minutes ago, found him here.

618
00:47:19,601 --> 00:47:21,481
None of the neighbors
heard anything.

619
00:47:21,641 --> 00:47:22,921
There was no forced entry..

620
00:47:23,081 --> 00:47:25,281
and no one saw anyone
else fleeing the scene.

621
00:47:26,161 --> 00:47:29,962
Guys, blueprints from the bank.

622
00:47:30,122 --> 00:47:32,082
There's pictures, schematics.

623
00:47:32,242 --> 00:47:35,482
There's at least a dozen Internet
articles on the Saudi prince.

624
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:38,202
So that's it.

625
00:47:44,082 --> 00:47:46,923
You've reached the Callo residence.
No one can get to the phone.

626
00:47:47,083 --> 00:47:49,123
Please leave a message.

627
00:47:49,843 --> 00:47:51,363
Detective Conners.

628
00:47:53,923 --> 00:47:56,363
Are you starting
to connect the dots?

629
00:47:56,523 --> 00:47:58,723
Putting all the pieces together?

630
00:48:01,803 --> 00:48:04,004
Is the pattern starting to emerge?

631
00:48:07,004 --> 00:48:09,164
They wouldn't punish you..

632
00:48:09,964 --> 00:48:11,244
but I will.

633
00:48:13,524 --> 00:48:16,124
Vengeance will be mine, detective.

634
00:48:17,004 --> 00:48:18,844
Then come and get me,
you piece of shit.

635
00:48:44,366 --> 00:48:46,926
What they told Callo was the plan
and what the plan was..

636
00:48:47,086 --> 00:48:48,846
must have been
two different things.

637
00:48:49,006 --> 00:48:51,886
Obviously this wasn't part
of a plan Callo would've agreed with.

638
00:48:52,046 --> 00:48:53,807
You'd think a cop would be smarter.

639
00:48:53,967 --> 00:48:55,527
Come on.
As cops, we come across..

640
00:48:55,687 --> 00:48:59,727
every temptation in the book.
Money, drugs, power.

641
00:48:59,887 --> 00:49:03,847
We all like to think we can resist
any urge, but we're not saints.

642
00:49:04,007 --> 00:49:07,087
So Callo was involved,
and now they're dragging you into it.

643
00:49:07,247 --> 00:49:10,128
- Why?
- Man said he wanted vengeance.

644
00:49:11,248 --> 00:49:12,848
Piss anyone off lately?

645
00:49:14,168 --> 00:49:15,248
Me?

646
00:49:15,408 --> 00:49:17,968
So I just got off the phone
with Agent Doyle..

647
00:49:18,128 --> 00:49:20,448
and apparently after
the Charlotte break-in..

648
00:49:20,608 --> 00:49:23,368
the prince withdrew
all his possessions..

649
00:49:23,528 --> 00:49:26,289
from every safe-deposit box
in the country.

650
00:49:27,249 --> 00:49:28,809
- They didn't touch the cash.
- No.

651
00:49:28,969 --> 00:49:31,009
- Or the safe-deposit boxes.
- Nope.

652
00:49:31,169 --> 00:49:36,369
So they break into a bank,
blow it up, and steal nothing?

653
00:49:36,529 --> 00:49:37,809
Still make sense to you?

654
00:49:37,969 --> 00:49:40,209
Nothing about today makes sense.

655
00:49:40,369 --> 00:49:41,809
Excuse me.

656
00:49:58,290 --> 00:50:00,291
Return to the earth now..

657
00:50:00,451 --> 00:50:03,971
if your mind is troubled
and your heart is uncertain..

658
00:50:04,131 --> 00:50:08,531
for it is by returning to the beginning
that we can clearly see the path.

659
00:50:09,331 --> 00:50:10,891
He's your find.

660
00:50:12,251 --> 00:50:16,212
Detective, wanna say that again?

661
00:50:16,372 --> 00:50:18,892
We go back to where this all started.

662
00:50:19,052 --> 00:50:20,452
We go back to the bank.

663
00:50:31,572 --> 00:50:34,733
The tapes are confirming five bad
guys, but since the vault cam blew..

664
00:50:34,893 --> 00:50:37,613
what they did in there
is a total mystery.

665
00:50:37,773 --> 00:50:40,373
I've been through these tapes
20 times. I'm telling you..

666
00:50:40,533 --> 00:50:41,973
Shut up, Dax.

667
00:51:01,334 --> 00:51:03,534
Wait. Hold on a second.
Do you see that?

668
00:51:03,694 --> 00:51:06,455
- See what?
- Go back a little.

669
00:51:06,615 --> 00:51:08,935
- What?
- Look closely at the camera angles.

670
00:51:09,095 --> 00:51:11,335
They're all fixed, right?
They don't rotate or pan.

671
00:51:11,495 --> 00:51:12,655
Okay, play it.

672
00:51:12,815 --> 00:51:15,575
Now, Camera 8 dominates our
attention because of the explosion.

673
00:51:15,735 --> 00:51:17,975
But while that's happening,
check out Camera 2.

674
00:51:19,735 --> 00:51:21,495
Where are you going?

675
00:51:23,336 --> 00:51:24,936
Changed the angle.

676
00:51:25,096 --> 00:51:26,616
Watched it 20 times, eh, Dax?

677
00:51:26,776 --> 00:51:29,816
What's in that corner
they don't want us to see?

678
00:51:30,616 --> 00:51:34,136
So are you at all concerned there's
some wacko trying to get you?

679
00:51:34,936 --> 00:51:38,936
If I worried about every threat made
against me, I'd never leave the house.

680
00:51:40,017 --> 00:51:41,817
Watch your eyes.

681
00:51:46,577 --> 00:51:47,897
Lots of prints here.

682
00:51:48,057 --> 00:51:50,617
Check them all. Anyone's got a record,
I want an ID.

683
00:51:50,777 --> 00:51:52,217
You got it.

684
00:51:52,377 --> 00:51:54,577
- Dax.
- Yes, sir?

685
00:51:56,538 --> 00:51:58,178
You hack into this?

686
00:51:58,338 --> 00:52:01,978
Hack into a nationwide
bank security system?

687
00:52:02,138 --> 00:52:04,578
Yeah, I'd love to.

688
00:52:04,738 --> 00:52:06,298
Hang on. Hang on.

689
00:52:06,458 --> 00:52:08,218
So, what do we do
in the meantime?

690
00:52:08,378 --> 00:52:10,298
Do you like Italian?

691
00:52:20,779 --> 00:52:23,019
As if we didn't get in the way.

692
00:52:23,179 --> 00:52:24,459
You never know with you guys.

693
00:52:24,619 --> 00:52:26,859
What was that thing you were saying
at the house..

694
00:52:27,019 --> 00:52:30,460
about returning to
the beginning path or something?

695
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:32,820
Yeah, it's a Buddha story.

696
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:34,660
We're all ears.

697
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:43,100
One day, the Buddha
found his heart in turmoil..

698
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:45,661
so he retreats to the forest,
to the earth..

699
00:52:45,821 --> 00:52:47,941
to the base of a great tree.

700
00:52:48,101 --> 00:52:50,621
And I'm paraphrasing..

701
00:52:50,781 --> 00:52:52,981
but this elephant comes up
and tells Buddha..

702
00:52:53,141 --> 00:52:55,381
he doesn't like
seeing him discouraged, and..

703
00:52:55,541 --> 00:52:57,701
He can talk to an elephant?

704
00:52:57,861 --> 00:53:00,701
He's the Buddha. He's attained
the sixth level of consciousness.

705
00:53:00,861 --> 00:53:06,102
He's capable of communicating
with plants, trees, even rocks.

706
00:53:07,102 --> 00:53:08,542
Rocks.

707
00:53:10,462 --> 00:53:13,982
- You asked.
- Come on, guys. Please. Continue.

708
00:53:14,142 --> 00:53:16,382
The Buddha was troubled.
He goes to the beginning.

709
00:53:16,542 --> 00:53:22,023
He goes back to where he came from
to find the path, the answer.

710
00:53:22,183 --> 00:53:23,943
So when you hit a dead end..

711
00:53:24,103 --> 00:53:26,103
go back to the beginning
to find your way.

712
00:53:26,263 --> 00:53:28,583
Or something like that.

713
00:53:31,223 --> 00:53:33,823
We have a genuine philosopher
in our midst.

714
00:53:33,983 --> 00:53:36,264
Are you..? Are you a Buddhist?

715
00:53:36,424 --> 00:53:38,424
No. Just something
I picked up along the way.

716
00:53:38,584 --> 00:53:41,184
But you're religious?

717
00:53:41,824 --> 00:53:43,184
Not particularly.

718
00:53:45,704 --> 00:53:46,784
Excuse me.

719
00:53:52,185 --> 00:53:55,865
- You guys are all pretty tight?
- We've been through a lot together.

720
00:53:56,025 --> 00:53:58,025
- Yeah.
- I guess I just thought..

721
00:53:58,185 --> 00:54:02,145
I don't know.
With him being in so much trouble..

722
00:54:02,305 --> 00:54:05,865
coming back from the suspension,
everyone might treat him differently.

723
00:54:06,025 --> 00:54:08,625
You can't really believe
what you read or see on TV.

724
00:54:08,786 --> 00:54:11,426
I mean, if anything,
our tie to Quentin's gotten stronger.

725
00:54:11,586 --> 00:54:13,386
Even when things
got pretty wild today..

726
00:54:13,546 --> 00:54:15,746
and everybody else panicked,
he was in control.

727
00:54:15,906 --> 00:54:18,786
Now, that just doesn't happen.
He's just.. He's that good.

728
00:54:18,946 --> 00:54:20,826
Excuse me.

729
00:54:29,627 --> 00:54:31,587
What are you doing?

730
00:54:31,747 --> 00:54:33,667
I realized something today.

731
00:54:34,747 --> 00:54:37,827
Being around you,
all that's happened, I can't..

732
00:54:39,187 --> 00:54:41,707
I think I made a mistake.

733
00:54:41,867 --> 00:54:43,268
It's too late.

734
00:54:44,588 --> 00:54:45,908
You made your choice.

735
00:54:46,068 --> 00:54:47,508
Now live with it.

736
00:54:49,308 --> 00:54:50,668
They got a match.

737
00:54:50,828 --> 00:54:52,948
- Got a name?
- Chris Lei.

738
00:54:53,108 --> 00:54:56,388
Prick used to work for some big-time
software company..

739
00:54:57,028 --> 00:54:59,109
till they caught him
pirating programs.

740
00:54:59,269 --> 00:55:01,509
Couple of years later,
he was busted for hacking..

741
00:55:01,669 --> 00:55:03,989
into the pension plans
of retired cops.

742
00:55:04,149 --> 00:55:06,309
I'd say for a genius,
he's a fucking moron.

743
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:09,709
This was your case, you and York.

744
00:55:09,869 --> 00:55:11,589
You made the bust.
Why didn't it stick?

745
00:55:11,749 --> 00:55:13,949
We were in the middle
of the Pearl Street fallout.

746
00:55:14,109 --> 00:55:16,910
His lawyer put us on trial,
said we were crooked, abusive..

747
00:55:17,070 --> 00:55:18,630
and that we planted evidence.

748
00:55:18,790 --> 00:55:19,910
Jury bought it.

749
00:55:20,070 --> 00:55:21,350
Was it true?

750
00:55:21,510 --> 00:55:24,710
The guy was guilty. He was scum.
That's the truth.

751
00:55:25,550 --> 00:55:27,310
There's something
they don't teach you.

752
00:55:27,470 --> 00:55:30,790
The system breaks down,
you have to compensate to get results.

753
00:55:30,950 --> 00:55:33,031
That gives you the right
to break the rules?

754
00:55:33,191 --> 00:55:35,911
Bend, not break.

755
00:55:36,071 --> 00:55:37,991
It means justice absolutely.

756
00:55:39,471 --> 00:55:42,431
Another thing they don't teach you.

757
00:55:58,192 --> 00:55:59,832
Come on.

758
00:55:59,992 --> 00:56:01,592
Come on.

759
00:56:09,993 --> 00:56:11,273
Shit.

760
00:56:17,953 --> 00:56:20,513
Fare thee well, Chris.

761
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:04,080
- You okay?
- Yeah.

762
00:58:34,401 --> 00:58:36,002
Shit.

763
00:58:44,562 --> 00:58:46,042
That should do it.

764
00:58:46,202 --> 00:58:48,122
You can put your shirt back on.

765
00:58:51,963 --> 00:58:54,923
Look at that. First day in the city,
and you've already been shot.

766
00:58:55,083 --> 00:58:56,403
Just grazed him.

767
00:58:56,563 --> 00:58:59,123
Why don't I just graze you
with a bullet, see how you feel?

768
00:59:00,003 --> 00:59:01,363
Hey, Damon Richards's awake.

769
00:59:12,564 --> 00:59:14,724
Take five, guys.

770
00:59:17,244 --> 00:59:19,604
Hey, Damon.

771
00:59:19,764 --> 00:59:21,684
How you feeling?

772
00:59:22,324 --> 00:59:24,725
What? No flowers for me?

773
00:59:24,885 --> 00:59:27,365
We got you dead to rights
on murder and armed robbery..

774
00:59:27,525 --> 00:59:29,085
and you're there cracking jokes.

775
00:59:29,245 --> 00:59:32,565
- You fucking idiot.
- Fuck yourself.

776
00:59:34,325 --> 00:59:36,885
Detective.

777
00:59:38,205 --> 00:59:39,805
May I?

778
00:59:46,646 --> 00:59:48,406
You remember me, don't you, Damon?

779
00:59:52,686 --> 00:59:54,766
Thought so.

780
00:59:54,926 --> 00:59:56,726
Now, we're only
gonna give you one chance.

781
00:59:56,886 --> 00:59:59,727
One chance to tell us what we need
to know and help yourself.

782
00:59:59,887 --> 01:00:00,887
Really?

783
01:00:01,047 --> 01:00:03,207
Just one chance?

784
01:00:09,807 --> 01:00:12,527
I was skiing about three years ago
in Aspen.

785
01:00:12,687 --> 01:00:14,528
Beautiful country.

786
01:00:14,688 --> 01:00:16,648
You ever been, Damon?

787
01:00:17,848 --> 01:00:20,008
Never mind.

788
01:00:20,168 --> 01:00:23,528
I hit a mogul..

789
01:00:23,688 --> 01:00:27,128
landed on a sheet of ice,
and slammed into a tree.

790
01:00:27,288 --> 01:00:31,769
Broke myself up pretty bad,
kind of like you did today.

791
01:00:32,529 --> 01:00:34,569
I was in a hospital bed
for three months.

792
01:00:36,249 --> 01:00:38,409
Had it not been for..

793
01:00:38,569 --> 01:00:41,849
Here it is, morphine.

794
01:00:42,609 --> 01:00:44,969
Without this stuff,
I wouldn't have made it.

795
01:00:56,250 --> 01:00:59,450
This I.V. drip administers
a small dosage every minute or so..

796
01:00:59,610 --> 01:01:05,811
makes you feel nice and relaxed,
calm, no pain..

797
01:01:05,971 --> 01:01:08,211
but..

798
01:01:08,371 --> 01:01:14,331
if I were to inject this whole thing,
that'd be all she wrote for Damon.

799
01:01:24,972 --> 01:01:27,932
This equipment malfunctions
all the time, Damon.

800
01:01:28,092 --> 01:01:31,492
Overdoses are quite common.
Besides, I don't think the DA's..

801
01:01:31,652 --> 01:01:34,492
gonna launch a full-scale
investigation over a scum like you.

802
01:01:44,373 --> 01:01:46,613
You don't have to tell us anything.

803
01:01:46,773 --> 01:01:49,013
Plead the fifth.

804
01:01:49,173 --> 01:01:50,733
Roll the dice.

805
01:01:54,094 --> 01:01:56,254
Okay. Okay. I'll talk.

806
01:01:56,414 --> 01:01:58,854
You're a fucking hypocrite.

807
01:01:59,014 --> 01:02:01,294
Question my interrogation skills?

808
01:02:01,454 --> 01:02:03,934
At least I don't threaten them
with a lethal overdose.

809
01:02:04,094 --> 01:02:06,654
There's never been a case
in recorded medical history..

810
01:02:06,814 --> 01:02:10,374
of someone overdosing
on 5 ccs of saline.

811
01:02:12,255 --> 01:02:14,175
Bend, not break.

812
01:02:14,335 --> 01:02:16,735
That's what you said, right?

813
01:02:23,335 --> 01:02:28,016
Damon Richards testifies that
Lorenz's true identity is Scott Curtis.

814
01:02:28,176 --> 01:02:30,856
He's wanted in connection
with three other bank robberies..

815
01:02:31,016 --> 01:02:32,816
extortion and kidnapping.

816
01:02:32,976 --> 01:02:34,936
He's also the brother of
John Curtis..

817
01:02:35,096 --> 01:02:38,616
the perp Conners shot
on the Pearl Street Bridge.

818
01:02:38,776 --> 01:02:40,576
We have the names
of two accomplices..

819
01:02:40,736 --> 01:02:42,776
Lamar Galt and Xander Harrington.

820
01:02:42,936 --> 01:02:45,857
Everybody was supposed to
meet up tonight at 10..

821
01:02:46,017 --> 01:02:47,617
and we have that address.

822
01:02:47,777 --> 01:02:50,697
Now, after finding Callo and Lei
dead today..

823
01:02:50,857 --> 01:02:54,057
doesn't take a rocket surgeon
to figure that Curtis is eliminating..

824
01:02:54,217 --> 01:02:55,777
his accomplices one by one.

825
01:02:55,937 --> 01:02:58,457
Doesn't matter what he told
Galt and Harrington.

826
01:02:58,617 --> 01:03:00,818
He's planning on
finishing them off tonight.

827
01:03:06,498 --> 01:03:08,058
Never think of the repercussions.

828
01:03:09,578 --> 01:03:15,018
Suspect's mother, father, brother.

829
01:03:15,178 --> 01:03:17,059
How your decision affects them.

830
01:03:21,539 --> 01:03:23,619
Had murder in his eyes.

831
01:03:23,779 --> 01:03:25,699
John Curtis?

832
01:03:25,859 --> 01:03:29,059
It was pouring, lights everywhere.

833
01:03:31,299 --> 01:03:32,739
If he had only done what I said:

834
01:03:32,899 --> 01:03:34,300
"Drop the weapon."

835
01:03:39,380 --> 01:03:41,460
But it was not to be.

836
01:03:44,140 --> 01:03:46,340
My dad died when I was 12.

837
01:03:47,420 --> 01:03:50,180
He walked into a liquor store
in the middle of a holdup.

838
01:03:50,341 --> 01:03:52,461
Guy just opened fire.

839
01:03:52,621 --> 01:03:55,821
He didn't even have time to react.

840
01:03:55,981 --> 01:03:58,341
They said he was a hero.

841
01:03:58,501 --> 01:04:01,461
Know what that means
to a 12-year-old?

842
01:04:01,621 --> 01:04:03,621
Because he dies on the job,
he's a hero?

843
01:04:03,781 --> 01:04:05,141
Never made sense to me.

844
01:04:06,061 --> 01:04:07,742
So why become a cop?

845
01:04:09,382 --> 01:04:11,222
Finish what he started.

846
01:04:11,382 --> 01:04:13,662
Every day, he went out
trying to do some good..

847
01:04:13,822 --> 01:04:17,302
tried to help the people
who couldn't help themselves.

848
01:04:18,262 --> 01:04:21,862
"Just give them a chance,"
is what he always said.

849
01:04:22,022 --> 01:04:24,743
Didn't always work out, but he tried.

850
01:04:25,703 --> 01:04:29,303
You tried to help
save that girl on the bridge.

851
01:04:29,463 --> 01:04:31,783
If you weren't there,
the girl still would've died.

852
01:04:56,905 --> 01:04:58,825
- How long we gonna sit here?
- I don't know.

853
01:04:58,985 --> 01:05:01,025
Come on.

854
01:05:02,345 --> 01:05:03,505
It's 25 after.

855
01:05:03,665 --> 01:05:05,945
How much longer we waiting?

856
01:05:06,105 --> 01:05:08,905
We go now, all we get
is Galt and Harrington.

857
01:05:09,065 --> 01:05:10,065
Want Curtis.

858
01:05:10,225 --> 01:05:12,425
Now relax and keep the line free.

859
01:05:13,386 --> 01:05:15,346
Fucking prick's driving me mad.

860
01:05:23,626 --> 01:05:24,746
Shit.

861
01:05:24,906 --> 01:05:27,946
- What?
- I'm out of gum.

862
01:05:30,867 --> 01:05:34,787
- Look, man, call him. Okay? Fuck this.
- Shut the fuck up, all right?

863
01:05:34,947 --> 01:05:37,307
I'm not sitting around here
all fucking day, man.

864
01:05:37,467 --> 01:05:39,547
We can't let him walk.
We gotta go now.

865
01:05:40,627 --> 01:05:43,187
No. Stand down.

866
01:05:45,787 --> 01:05:47,388
We bust him now, we got something.

867
01:05:47,548 --> 01:05:49,548
We let him get in that car,
we got jack squat.

868
01:05:50,268 --> 01:05:54,028
We got three cars and uniform backup
in all directions.

869
01:05:54,188 --> 01:05:56,708
If they ride, we'll reel them in.

870
01:05:57,868 --> 01:05:59,468
I want Curtis.

871
01:05:59,628 --> 01:06:03,509
Nobody goes into the house
until I say.

872
01:06:07,589 --> 01:06:08,949
He ain't answering.

873
01:06:11,949 --> 01:06:14,349
Gotta be fucking out here.

874
01:06:15,149 --> 01:06:16,909
- Turn it off.
- Shit!

875
01:06:25,070 --> 01:06:27,470
Trigger-happy sons of bitches.

876
01:06:31,790 --> 01:06:34,590
All units, shots fired! Officer down!
Send an ambulance!

877
01:06:34,750 --> 01:06:36,030
Take them alive.

878
01:06:36,190 --> 01:06:37,791
- Take the back, Shane.
- Got it.

879
01:07:15,433 --> 01:07:17,233
Teddy.

880
01:07:47,915 --> 01:07:49,635
Oh, my God.

881
01:08:19,797 --> 01:08:21,677
Jesus.

882
01:08:29,917 --> 01:08:31,717
Drop the gun.

883
01:08:31,877 --> 01:08:33,838
Last warning.

884
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:11,080
Get out of the house!

885
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:12,600
Get out of the house now!

886
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:18,400
Get down!

887
01:09:39,041 --> 01:09:41,162
Hey, where's Conners?

888
01:10:26,524 --> 01:10:28,684
Back up that line.

889
01:10:31,645 --> 01:10:33,685
Little more?

890
01:10:33,845 --> 01:10:35,165
- Okay.
- Need more morphine?

891
01:10:35,325 --> 01:10:37,725
No. Yeah. Be great. Thank you.

892
01:10:44,285 --> 01:10:46,486
Get that entrance in the back.

893
01:10:52,366 --> 01:10:54,206
Check it out.

894
01:11:01,606 --> 01:11:04,287
It's just.. It's.. It's hard to take.

895
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:09,047
I mean, you know, if it had to happen
to somebody, well..

896
01:11:10,007 --> 01:11:12,927
Oh, you son of a bitch.

897
01:11:13,887 --> 01:11:15,087
Teddy?

898
01:11:15,247 --> 01:11:17,487
You've always been jealous
of him, Martin.

899
01:11:19,648 --> 01:11:20,768
Jealous?

900
01:11:20,928 --> 01:11:25,088
It's because he wasn't just
a better cop, he was a better man.

901
01:11:25,888 --> 01:11:27,568
Detective, go home.

902
01:11:36,649 --> 01:11:38,369
Is there something you wanna say?

903
01:11:39,649 --> 01:11:41,249
No, sir.

904
01:11:41,409 --> 01:11:43,249
She said it perfectly.

905
01:11:51,529 --> 01:11:53,570
You okay?

906
01:11:53,730 --> 01:11:55,290
Conners was right.

907
01:11:55,450 --> 01:11:58,050
We should've never gone in.

908
01:11:58,210 --> 01:12:00,010
How fucking dumb are we?

909
01:12:27,012 --> 01:12:28,932
Detective.

910
01:12:29,932 --> 01:12:32,452
I know what they were doing
inside the bank.

911
01:12:32,612 --> 01:12:34,612
Here's a record of transactions
from the bank.

912
01:12:34,772 --> 01:12:38,812
An average day produces
about 3- or 400 pages, give or take.

913
01:12:38,972 --> 01:12:42,693
Today there were over 3000 pages.

914
01:12:42,853 --> 01:12:43,813
Meaning?

915
01:12:43,973 --> 01:12:46,573
We've just witnessed
the largest bank heist in history..

916
01:12:46,733 --> 01:12:47,973
about a billion dollars.

917
01:12:49,173 --> 01:12:50,213
Come again?

918
01:12:50,373 --> 01:12:51,813
They planted a computer virus.

919
01:12:51,973 --> 01:12:54,253
It randomly withdraws money
from all the accounts..

920
01:12:54,413 --> 01:12:56,733
and deposits it
into the bad guys' account.

921
01:12:56,893 --> 01:13:00,374
Now, if you look at all the transactions,
no two amounts are the same..

922
01:13:00,534 --> 01:13:02,374
and none of them are over $100.

923
01:13:03,014 --> 01:13:06,534
You see, most security systems
work on the size of the money..

924
01:13:06,694 --> 01:13:08,294
not the amount of transactions..

925
01:13:08,454 --> 01:13:12,134
so you wire out a million dollars
from a handful of accounts..

926
01:13:12,294 --> 01:13:13,614
red flags pop up..

927
01:13:13,774 --> 01:13:18,215
but wire out less than $100
from, say, 10 million accounts..

928
01:13:18,375 --> 01:13:20,375
no red flags.

929
01:13:20,535 --> 01:13:22,775
- Where's the money now?
- I don't know.

930
01:13:22,935 --> 01:13:24,535
What do you mean you don't know?

931
01:13:24,695 --> 01:13:27,455
Well, the virus set up a host
of phantom accounts, right..

932
01:13:27,615 --> 01:13:30,535
where the money sits
until it transfers to another account..

933
01:13:30,695 --> 01:13:33,656
and another and another.
It's never in one place long enough..

934
01:13:33,816 --> 01:13:36,616
- ..to get an accurate fix on it.
- The money's moving around?

935
01:13:36,776 --> 01:13:39,056
Yeah. Any withdrawal or deposit
from any bank..

936
01:13:39,216 --> 01:13:41,896
doesn't normally go through
till the next business day..

937
01:13:42,056 --> 01:13:46,056
so all these are just gonna float
around till 9 a.m. tomorrow.

938
01:13:46,216 --> 01:13:48,617
- Or 6 a.m. Pacific time.
- Sure.

939
01:13:48,777 --> 01:13:50,737
Sunrise.

940
01:13:50,897 --> 01:13:54,497
Why break in? If they're wiring money,
couldn't they do that from anywhere?

941
01:13:54,657 --> 01:13:58,057
No. See, that's the regional manager's
computer terminal.

942
01:13:58,217 --> 01:14:01,177
From there, you have unlimited entry
into the bank's mainframe..

943
01:14:01,337 --> 01:14:04,097
so there's no more working
around passwords, no hacking in.

944
01:14:04,257 --> 01:14:06,538
It's straight in, nice and clean.

945
01:14:07,538 --> 01:14:10,538
A billion dollars is missing,
and we're only discovering this now?

946
01:14:10,698 --> 01:14:12,778
Ironically, when you guys
shut off the power..

947
01:14:12,938 --> 01:14:16,178
it helped hide the virus
and bought it time to work.

948
01:14:18,018 --> 01:14:21,538
They weren't trying to make it look like
they were robbing to rip off a prince.

949
01:14:21,698 --> 01:14:25,579
They were making it look like they
ripped off a prince to rob a bank.

950
01:14:25,739 --> 01:14:27,819
Chaos theory.

951
01:14:28,979 --> 01:14:30,219
What you gonna do now?

952
01:14:32,819 --> 01:14:35,059
I think this is beyond our jurisdiction.

953
01:14:43,820 --> 01:14:45,980
- Hello.
- Detective, there's a call for you.

954
01:14:46,140 --> 01:14:48,380
- Says it's urgent.
- Put it through.

955
01:14:48,540 --> 01:14:49,940
Good evening, detective.

956
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:52,300
My compliments on a fine day.

957
01:14:52,460 --> 01:14:54,900
You are an unexpected
and challenging adversary.

958
01:14:55,061 --> 01:14:57,061
- It's not over yet.
- Wishful thinking.

959
01:14:57,221 --> 01:14:59,421
No, my wish is to catch you.

960
01:14:59,581 --> 01:15:01,581
You're a murderer,
a cop killer at that.

961
01:15:01,741 --> 01:15:04,421
I didn't kill anyone
who didn't deserve it.

962
01:15:04,581 --> 01:15:06,821
Callo was insignificant..

963
01:15:06,981 --> 01:15:10,621
and Conners, he deserved his fate.

964
01:15:11,021 --> 01:15:12,542
I know about the money.

965
01:15:12,702 --> 01:15:15,022
You steal a billion dollars,
they will find you.

966
01:15:15,182 --> 01:15:17,742
A risk I'm willing to take.

967
01:15:45,544 --> 01:15:47,024
Sir.

968
01:15:47,664 --> 01:15:48,704
It doesn't add up.

969
01:15:48,864 --> 01:15:51,024
What doesn't add up, detective?

970
01:15:51,184 --> 01:15:54,384
Why would he say
Callo's insignificant?

971
01:15:54,544 --> 01:15:55,624
Who?

972
01:15:55,784 --> 01:15:58,344
Lorenz. Curtis called me.

973
01:15:59,104 --> 01:16:00,144
Really?

974
01:16:00,304 --> 01:16:02,625
He said he didn't kill anyone
who didn't deserve it.

975
01:16:02,785 --> 01:16:04,905
He said Callo was insignificant,
but he wasn't.

976
01:16:05,065 --> 01:16:08,625
Without Callo, he doesn't have
the knowledge of the department..

977
01:16:09,025 --> 01:16:11,785
or the front money
to hire the crew.

978
01:16:12,265 --> 01:16:15,265
- Curtis called you?
- Yeah.

979
01:16:15,425 --> 01:16:17,705
Well, now he's screwing
with your head.

980
01:16:20,146 --> 01:16:22,546
You did good today, Shane.

981
01:16:22,706 --> 01:16:24,986
Father would be very proud.

982
01:16:26,706 --> 01:16:28,146
Get some sleep.

983
01:16:28,306 --> 01:16:30,226
Be more bad guys
for you tomorrow.

984
01:17:10,229 --> 01:17:13,029
I was in bed already.
This couldn't wait till tomorrow?

985
01:17:13,189 --> 01:17:14,709
Sit down.

986
01:17:20,229 --> 01:17:23,389
How did he come after you? It's the
only thing that doesn't make sense.

987
01:17:23,549 --> 01:17:25,030
What are you talking about?

988
01:17:25,190 --> 01:17:28,790
All day long,
we thought Callo was the dirty cop.

989
01:17:28,950 --> 01:17:30,870
All day long, we were wrong.

990
01:17:32,670 --> 01:17:35,030
Here's the sign-out sheet
from the evidence room.

991
01:17:35,190 --> 01:17:38,790
Here is one of Callo's reports.

992
01:17:39,550 --> 01:17:41,070
Here's another one..

993
01:17:41,231 --> 01:17:42,551
and another one.

994
01:17:45,311 --> 01:17:47,631
They're not the same signatures,
Harry.

995
01:17:47,791 --> 01:17:49,111
They're not even close.

996
01:17:49,271 --> 01:17:52,111
Maybe he got a cramp in his hand.
I don't know.

997
01:17:52,751 --> 01:17:53,751
Here's your file.

998
01:17:55,191 --> 01:17:56,831
You were reprimanded
one month ago..

999
01:17:56,991 --> 01:17:59,352
when you confronted Callo
outside the courthouse.

1000
01:17:59,512 --> 01:18:00,792
You punched him.

1001
01:18:00,952 --> 01:18:03,872
- That ring a bell?
- And I'd do it again.

1002
01:18:04,032 --> 01:18:05,792
Cops who testify against cops..

1003
01:18:05,952 --> 01:18:08,432
shouldn't be breathing
the same air I do.

1004
01:18:08,592 --> 01:18:11,992
- There's a line you don't cross.
- So you set him up.

1005
01:18:12,152 --> 01:18:13,632
You forged Callo's signature..

1006
01:18:13,792 --> 01:18:16,313
you gave him money
and you helped him with his plan..

1007
01:18:16,473 --> 01:18:18,473
because you thought
he got the raw deal..

1008
01:18:18,633 --> 01:18:20,273
and don't deny it because I know!

1009
01:18:20,433 --> 01:18:22,713
Of course he got a raw deal
at Pearl Street Bridge!

1010
01:18:22,873 --> 01:18:25,713
Everybody got a raw deal!

1011
01:18:27,273 --> 01:18:29,513
You're helping a cop killer, Harry.

1012
01:18:30,393 --> 01:18:32,674
You're a year
away from your pension.

1013
01:18:32,834 --> 01:18:36,594
- Is this how you wanna go out?
- My conscience is clean.

1014
01:18:44,234 --> 01:18:47,514
This has been a very long..

1015
01:18:48,315 --> 01:18:49,755
day.

1016
01:18:53,435 --> 01:18:54,995
And I'm tired, Harry.

1017
01:18:57,875 --> 01:18:59,795
It's like we're chasing
a phantom here.

1018
01:19:01,155 --> 01:19:03,995
Just when we have him..

1019
01:19:05,756 --> 01:19:07,196
he disappears.

1020
01:19:08,676 --> 01:19:12,636
He's been two steps ahead
of Conners and me all day.

1021
01:19:12,796 --> 01:19:13,996
Of course he has.

1022
01:19:14,156 --> 01:19:16,196
Who knows Conners
better than him?

1023
01:19:23,437 --> 01:19:26,117
How the hell does Curtis
know Conners better than anyone?

1024
01:19:32,037 --> 01:19:34,077
We're not talking about Curtis,
are we, Harry?

1025
01:19:39,878 --> 01:19:41,878
Who would know Conners
better than anyone?

1026
01:19:46,238 --> 01:19:47,998
Who would you protect?

1027
01:19:50,918 --> 01:19:53,878
And who in your mind got the raw deal
at Pearl Street Bridge?

1028
01:20:02,639 --> 01:20:03,879
Drop the weapon!

1029
01:20:04,039 --> 01:20:05,799
One more step and the girl dies.

1030
01:20:07,919 --> 01:20:10,399
That you don't wanna do.

1031
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:16,600
Think about it.

1032
01:20:16,760 --> 01:20:18,240
You kill her, where you gonna go?

1033
01:20:55,402 --> 01:20:57,642
It was York who was the dirty cop.

1034
01:20:57,802 --> 01:21:01,523
He assumed Scott Curtis' identity
to throw us off the trail.

1035
01:21:05,443 --> 01:21:09,443
York plays his old partner,
knowing all his moves.

1036
01:21:09,603 --> 01:21:11,563
Cut the power.

1037
01:21:11,723 --> 01:21:12,883
Now.

1038
01:21:16,923 --> 01:21:19,644
Frames his enemy for the crime.
Kills him too.

1039
01:21:21,164 --> 01:21:23,364
Look at this.
Blueprints from the bank.

1040
01:21:23,524 --> 01:21:25,444
There's pictures, schematics.

1041
01:21:25,604 --> 01:21:28,564
There's at least a dozen Internet
articles on the Saudi prince.

1042
01:21:28,724 --> 01:21:32,884
And pulls off one of the biggest
robberies in history.

1043
01:21:34,885 --> 01:21:37,405
You do what you want to me.

1044
01:21:37,565 --> 01:21:41,045
He called me to tell me he's going
and you ain't gonna find him.

1045
01:21:41,765 --> 01:21:43,565
Watch me.

1046
01:21:45,205 --> 01:21:48,325
The number that York used to call
Harry Hume is his cell phone number.

1047
01:21:48,485 --> 01:21:50,245
Ran it through
all the service providers.

1048
01:21:50,405 --> 01:21:52,926
- Nextel got a match.
- Can they get a location on him?

1049
01:21:53,086 --> 01:21:55,366
Should trace his location
within 100 meters or less.

1050
01:21:55,526 --> 01:21:57,126
- Great.
- Oh, hang on.

1051
01:21:57,286 --> 01:21:58,846
Hello.

1052
01:21:59,966 --> 01:22:02,526
Got him. Excellent. Thank you.

1053
01:22:38,408 --> 01:22:40,128
That'll be 8.48, please.

1054
01:22:42,969 --> 01:22:44,969
Keep the change..

1055
01:22:45,129 --> 01:22:46,729
doll face.

1056
01:22:46,889 --> 01:22:48,809
Thanks, mister.

1057
01:22:51,609 --> 01:22:53,209
Jason York, this is the police.

1058
01:22:53,369 --> 01:22:56,009
Put your hands in the air
and get down on the ground slowly.

1059
01:22:56,169 --> 01:22:57,530
- Do it now.
- Don't shoot, okay?

1060
01:22:57,690 --> 01:22:59,530
Just be cool. Okay.

1061
01:22:59,690 --> 01:23:01,450
Get down on the pavement.

1062
01:23:01,610 --> 01:23:03,050
You win.

1063
01:23:03,210 --> 01:23:06,050
Oh, Jesus. Okay.

1064
01:23:06,210 --> 01:23:09,810
- Get down on the pavement now.
- Look, I'm cooperating, okay?

1065
01:23:09,970 --> 01:23:12,690
I give up. Be cool, okay? All right?

1066
01:23:12,850 --> 01:23:15,331
- You win. I'm putting my hat down.
- I didn't ask you to.

1067
01:23:15,491 --> 01:23:17,131
Put your hands
where I can see them.

1068
01:23:17,291 --> 01:23:19,891
I said I give up, all right?

1069
01:23:20,051 --> 01:23:21,651
Final warning.

1070
01:23:24,931 --> 01:23:26,291
Take the back.

1071
01:23:35,212 --> 01:23:36,492
Was it Harry?

1072
01:23:36,652 --> 01:23:40,412
- It was Harry, right? Oh, that fat fuck.
- Drop the weapon and let the girl go.

1073
01:23:40,572 --> 01:23:41,972
- It's over.
- Nope.

1074
01:23:42,132 --> 01:23:45,372
If you wanna bring me in,
you gonna have to work for it.

1075
01:23:46,412 --> 01:23:47,693
That you don't wanna do.

1076
01:23:49,253 --> 01:23:52,613
Well, isn't that interesting?
That's exactly what I said to him.

1077
01:23:53,853 --> 01:23:55,973
I mean, do you see the irony here?

1078
01:23:56,133 --> 01:23:57,933
You see it? Or am I the only one?

1079
01:23:58,813 --> 01:24:00,653
Two months ago
I was in your shoes.

1080
01:24:01,253 --> 01:24:03,093
Yeah, standing there
with some punk..

1081
01:24:03,253 --> 01:24:05,494
holding a gun
to an innocent girl's head..

1082
01:24:05,654 --> 01:24:08,814
asking myself,
"What should I do?"

1083
01:24:09,614 --> 01:24:11,174
What would you do?

1084
01:24:12,294 --> 01:24:13,894
What would you do?

1085
01:24:14,454 --> 01:24:16,934
You'd do exactly what I did.

1086
01:24:17,094 --> 01:24:18,894
You'd try to make a difference.

1087
01:24:23,695 --> 01:24:24,815
Let's roll, baby.

1088
01:24:27,375 --> 01:24:29,135
Everybody out! Get out!

1089
01:24:29,295 --> 01:24:31,415
- You all right?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

1090
01:24:35,695 --> 01:24:37,296
Which way did he go?

1091
01:24:38,296 --> 01:24:40,616
He went towards the pier.

1092
01:25:01,777 --> 01:25:03,457
You really screwed yourself.

1093
01:25:04,217 --> 01:25:08,017
Jenkins is gonna expect these kind
of results from you every day.

1094
01:25:18,218 --> 01:25:22,618
FBI's got a team of 40 technicians
working on Lei's virus.

1095
01:25:22,778 --> 01:25:24,378
They'll break it.

1096
01:25:28,019 --> 01:25:29,819
Your conviction would be admirable.

1097
01:25:29,979 --> 01:25:31,459
It's just that it's so sad.

1098
01:25:56,780 --> 01:25:58,500
Get it through your head, man.

1099
01:25:58,660 --> 01:26:00,701
The cavalry ain't coming.

1100
01:26:00,861 --> 01:26:03,421
No, no.
No hero's coming to save the day.

1101
01:26:03,581 --> 01:26:04,821
Oh, no.

1102
01:26:05,941 --> 01:26:08,821
The bad guy wins
at the end of this story.

1103
01:26:12,501 --> 01:26:14,461
But I have to admit, though.

1104
01:26:14,621 --> 01:26:17,942
You have turned out to be
quite the little thorn.

1105
01:26:33,783 --> 01:26:36,863
I think Conners
would be sorry that you died.

1106
01:26:37,023 --> 01:26:38,703
Not me.

1107
01:28:10,468 --> 01:28:12,108
Come on.

1108
01:28:19,149 --> 01:28:21,949
I have come too far to be denied.

1109
01:29:24,153 --> 01:29:29,473
We used to spend all day Sunday
just reading in bed.

1110
01:29:29,633 --> 01:29:31,393
I would read the paper.

1111
01:29:31,553 --> 01:29:33,833
He'd read one of his
thousand books.

1112
01:29:35,714 --> 01:29:37,634
I didn't deserve him.

1113
01:29:37,794 --> 01:29:39,874
I knew that..

1114
01:29:40,034 --> 01:29:41,994
but I still loved him.

1115
01:29:48,234 --> 01:29:50,914
Did we all get shot today?

1116
01:29:52,915 --> 01:29:55,835
Yeah, they said the city
would be busy.

1117
01:29:55,995 --> 01:29:57,955
Every day like this?

1118
01:29:58,115 --> 01:29:59,915
Yeah, pretty much.

1119
01:30:00,075 --> 01:30:01,995
Great.

1120
01:30:02,155 --> 01:30:04,275
I wonder what's next.

1121
01:30:04,435 --> 01:30:05,915
Excuse me.

1122
01:30:17,156 --> 01:30:18,676
So how much?

1123
01:30:18,836 --> 01:30:22,596
Do you really think
I'm gonna charge you after all that?

1124
01:30:22,756 --> 01:30:25,356
- Go on.
- Thanks.

1125
01:30:36,237 --> 01:30:37,957
Smell that?

1126
01:30:38,117 --> 01:30:39,717
What is that?

1127
01:30:39,877 --> 01:30:41,477
Well, when evidence is taken in..

1128
01:30:41,637 --> 01:30:44,518
any physical contact can affect
our ability to lift prints..

1129
01:30:44,678 --> 01:30:48,078
so now to mark it, we just spray a
scented solution right on the bill.

1130
01:30:55,758 --> 01:30:58,278
Lastly, I don't like the Pac 10.

1131
01:30:58,438 --> 01:31:00,319
It's overrated.

1132
01:31:12,439 --> 01:31:13,999
Where is it?

1133
01:31:34,401 --> 01:31:36,081
Shit.

1134
01:31:43,041 --> 01:31:45,561
This Lorenz is trying
to tell us something.

1135
01:31:45,721 --> 01:31:48,041
Really? You don't say?

1136
01:31:52,202 --> 01:31:54,362
You ever heard of chaos theory?

1137
01:31:56,762 --> 01:32:00,362
Edward Lorenz invented the
chaos theory in the 1960s.

1138
01:32:00,522 --> 01:32:02,722
It's the study of phenomena
that appear random..

1139
01:32:02,882 --> 01:32:04,522
but have an element of regularity..

1140
01:32:04,682 --> 01:32:06,443
which can be described
mathematically.

1141
01:32:06,603 --> 01:32:09,883
- Try that again.
- Pretty much, initial state of events..

1142
01:32:10,043 --> 01:32:13,603
may seem unrelated and random,
but eventually a pattern emerges..

1143
01:32:13,763 --> 01:32:16,203
and in the end,
all the pieces fit together.

1144
01:32:16,843 --> 01:32:18,923
You tried all of them?

1145
01:32:19,083 --> 01:32:21,643
Nothing for Conners or Lorenz?

1146
01:32:22,324 --> 01:32:24,484
I don't know.

1147
01:32:24,644 --> 01:32:27,244
No. Maybe..
Maybe he's not on a flight.

1148
01:32:30,924 --> 01:32:32,204
Try again..

1149
01:32:32,364 --> 01:32:34,444
but try Gleick, James Gleick.

1150
01:32:49,045 --> 01:32:51,565
I need to know if passenger
James Gleick has checked in.

1151
01:32:51,725 --> 01:32:53,405
One moment.
We're gonna have to check.

1152
01:32:53,565 --> 01:32:55,406
Quickly, please.

1153
01:32:58,606 --> 01:32:59,606
Hello.

1154
01:32:59,766 --> 01:33:01,886
There's a passage
in the Surangama Sutra..

1155
01:33:02,046 --> 01:33:04,006
which roughly translated means:

1156
01:33:04,166 --> 01:33:07,926
"Things are not what they appear
to be, nor are they otherwise."

1157
01:33:08,086 --> 01:33:09,366
Conners.

1158
01:33:09,526 --> 01:33:11,126
Think about that a minute.

1159
01:33:11,286 --> 01:33:13,807
Doesn't that blow your mind?

1160
01:33:15,967 --> 01:33:17,847
What gave me away?

1161
01:33:18,007 --> 01:33:19,487
Ten bucks.

1162
01:33:19,647 --> 01:33:21,807
Fuck. The diner. That's right.

1163
01:33:21,967 --> 01:33:24,167
And it was Harry that gave up York.

1164
01:33:24,327 --> 01:33:25,807
Harry and a phone call.

1165
01:33:26,527 --> 01:33:29,328
He called me, said that Callo
was insignificant..

1166
01:33:29,488 --> 01:33:31,328
threw up all kinds of red flags.

1167
01:33:31,488 --> 01:33:32,808
That wasn't him.

1168
01:33:32,968 --> 01:33:34,968
That, my friend, was my mistake.

1169
01:33:35,128 --> 01:33:36,888
I called you.

1170
01:33:37,048 --> 01:33:39,568
No, my wish is to catch you.

1171
01:33:39,728 --> 01:33:42,128
You're a murderer,
a cop killer at that.

1172
01:33:42,288 --> 01:33:44,928
I didn't kill anyone
who didn't deserve it.

1173
01:33:45,089 --> 01:33:47,049
Callo was insignificant.

1174
01:33:47,209 --> 01:33:50,449
You know, York always thought
the plan was flawless.

1175
01:33:50,609 --> 01:33:54,609
If he'd only done what I said instead
of going off the deep end like he did.

1176
01:33:54,769 --> 01:33:57,329
I told him you have to leave room
for error.

1177
01:33:57,489 --> 01:34:00,969
You know, you can't always predict
how things are gonna play out.

1178
01:34:01,129 --> 01:34:04,130
A random camera catches
an image of Damon Richards.

1179
01:34:04,290 --> 01:34:06,370
The scent on the money.

1180
01:34:06,530 --> 01:34:08,050
You.

1181
01:34:08,210 --> 01:34:09,610
The chaos theory.

1182
01:34:09,770 --> 01:34:11,930
When you got that, I was impressed.

1183
01:34:12,090 --> 01:34:15,610
All day long we were trying to
figure out who the inside source was.

1184
01:34:15,770 --> 01:34:17,330
It was you.

1185
01:34:17,490 --> 01:34:18,771
Surprise.

1186
01:34:18,931 --> 01:34:21,251
What if we cut the power?
That'll disable the system.

1187
01:34:21,411 --> 01:34:24,371
We can open the locks manually,
go in that way.

1188
01:34:24,531 --> 01:34:25,771
That'll work.

1189
01:34:25,931 --> 01:34:28,731
A billion dollars is missing,
and we're discovering this now?

1190
01:34:28,891 --> 01:34:30,931
Ironically,
when you guys shut off the power..

1191
01:34:31,091 --> 01:34:33,571
it helped hide the virus
and bought it time to work.

1192
01:34:34,731 --> 01:34:37,372
Yeah, Teddy's pretty devastated
about your death.

1193
01:34:37,532 --> 01:34:39,252
She'll get over it.

1194
01:34:51,533 --> 01:34:53,053
Get down!

1195
01:34:58,533 --> 01:35:00,533
Hey, where's Conners?

1196
01:35:36,375 --> 01:35:39,375
So the corpse in the morgue
with your name on its toe?

1197
01:35:39,535 --> 01:35:42,736
Scott Curtis won't be bothering
anyone again.

1198
01:35:42,896 --> 01:35:44,656
You're a serial killer.

1199
01:35:44,816 --> 01:35:47,416
Oh, yeah? Well, who got killed?

1200
01:35:48,616 --> 01:35:54,176
Curtis, Harrington, Galt, Lei.
All fucking hoods.

1201
01:35:55,056 --> 01:35:57,256
World's safer with them gone.

1202
01:35:57,416 --> 01:35:59,977
You said they were all hoods.
What about Callo?

1203
01:36:00,137 --> 01:36:02,097
Callo deserved his fate.

1204
01:36:02,257 --> 01:36:03,417
It's his fault.

1205
01:36:03,577 --> 01:36:05,817
So this is all Callo's fault.

1206
01:36:05,977 --> 01:36:08,697
If it weren't for him, York and I
would never have done this.

1207
01:36:08,857 --> 01:36:12,577
One random act causes another,
causes another..

1208
01:36:12,737 --> 01:36:14,938
and in the end, the pattern emerges.

1209
01:36:15,898 --> 01:36:17,898
That is the chaos theory.

1210
01:36:19,178 --> 01:36:21,258
Oh, look at that.

1211
01:36:21,418 --> 01:36:25,378
It's after 6. The money's cleared.
I'm a wealthy man.

1212
01:36:25,538 --> 01:36:29,498
Lei, for all his evil,
was one smart son of a bitch.

1213
01:36:29,658 --> 01:36:31,939
The feds will be tracing false leads
for weeks.

1214
01:36:32,099 --> 01:36:34,459
You tanked Lei's trial on purpose.

1215
01:36:34,619 --> 01:36:37,299
They should have suspended me
after I testified.

1216
01:36:37,459 --> 01:36:39,099
What did they expect?

1217
01:36:39,259 --> 01:36:41,699
So why not kill me?
You had plenty of opportunities.

1218
01:36:41,859 --> 01:36:43,339
This wasn't about killing, Shane.

1219
01:36:43,499 --> 01:36:45,419
This was about standing up
for what matters.

1220
01:36:45,579 --> 01:36:48,780
Besides, you kind of grew on me.

1221
01:36:49,340 --> 01:36:51,860
- You're not gonna get away.
- I already have.

1222
01:36:52,020 --> 01:36:53,100
I'm not even here now.

1223
01:36:53,260 --> 01:36:55,380
This is a very valuable lesson
for you to learn.

1224
01:36:55,540 --> 01:36:57,780
- It's good you have learned it.
- Yeah? What's that?

1225
01:36:57,940 --> 01:36:59,820
You don't always win.

1226
01:36:59,980 --> 01:37:02,300
All your years of service for nothing.

1227
01:37:02,460 --> 01:37:03,820
You're a hypocrite.

1228
01:37:03,980 --> 01:37:05,621
I'm an opportunist.

1229
01:37:05,781 --> 01:37:09,501
I would have gladly died in the line
of duty, but they took that away.

1230
01:37:09,661 --> 01:37:13,021
They'd been as faithful to me,
none of this would have happened.

1231
01:37:13,181 --> 01:37:15,941
The system broke down.

1232
01:37:16,101 --> 01:37:18,261
Good luck, detective.

1233
01:37:18,421 --> 01:37:21,302
It would have been an
interesting partnership.

1234
01:37:21,462 --> 01:37:23,262
But I have to go now.

1235
01:37:26,502 --> 01:37:28,022
Conners.

1236
01:37:28,182 --> 01:37:29,662
Conners.

1237
01:37:32,342 --> 01:37:33,422
Attention, please.

1238
01:37:33,582 --> 01:37:39,703
Final call. Flight 1182 to Mexico City
now boarding at gate 23.

1239
01:37:45,823 --> 01:37:48,143
Enjoy your flight.

1240
01:38:17,905 --> 01:38:18,985
Thank you.

1241
01:38:19,145 --> 01:38:22,145
I'll let the captain know we're ready.

1242
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:49,000
