00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:55,984

-What do we know, Tom?
-We don't know shit, sir.

118
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:40,130
We know there was an anonymous call,
shots fired, that SNEU picked up. ..

119
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:42,424
. ..and went 84 immediately on.

120
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:45,510
Two minutes later, the neighbors call in,
another shot's fired.

121
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:48,347
They think the fucking building's
coming down around them.

122
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:52,684
Sectors respond, and they come to this
fucking bloodbath.

Let's fucking move.
Get these cars out of here!

136
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:41,733
Yo, we gotta make a lane for the bus.

137
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:45,070
- Right here.
- Move that one out of here.

00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:47,823
Open it up, come on. Let's go.

141
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:56,498

Upstairs, second floor.

145
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:06,258
We've got the block locked down,
the crime scene secured.

146
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,802
A level-three mobilization
worked out on anything--

147
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:12,013
What the fuck is Ruiz doing in here
lying with these scumbags?

148
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:13,390
Go.
-Get him out of here!

149
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:15,475

Yes, sir.

151
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,564
l want someone with the families
every moment--

152
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:23,942
Jimmy! Listen to me! Jimmy.

153
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:32,075
What the fuck?

154
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:34,286
Fuck, no!

155
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,334
Jimmy.

156
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,280
What the fuck?

157
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:24,252
They entered a tenement
at 1 86th and Audubon.

158
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,922
- For the purpose of?
- Responding to shots fired.

159

Two were DOA at the scene,
Officer Cavanaugh pronounced en route.

160
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:33,094
My last guy Lonnie Mercer's
up in surgery now.

161
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:35,263
All right. Where are we on task force?

FRANClS SR.
Being assembled. Smitty's on point.

All right. l want the best men available.

00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:43,396
The severity of the situation
is such l want cops we can trust.

165
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:51,863
Don't beat yourself up here, Franny.
There's no blame in this.

166
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:54,699
There's not a goddamned thing
any one of us could've done.

167
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,660
My cops, my command, Pop.

168
00:08:56,827 --> 00:09:00,121
We lose officers in the line, Francis.
lt's not your fault.

169
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:04,125
Forty years wading through shit like this,
watching our guys die.

170
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:05,377
You keep the rage.

171
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,547
You cut the rest of it loose.

172
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:28,650
Any word?

173
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:36,032
Pop's here.

174
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,035
Dr. King, please call the operating room.

175
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:40,870
Excuse me.
l'm sorry--

176
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:43,498
Let me go! l wanna see
my fucking husband.

177
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,376
l can't let you back here.
There's nothing l can do.

178
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,336
l wanna see my fucking husband!

179
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:51,339
Trish.
-l wanna see my fucking husband!

180
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:54,342
l wanna see his face.

181
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,595
l'm sorry, Trish. l'm so sorry.

182
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:01,516
Oh, my God.

183
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,635
Hey, kiddo.

184
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,094
Hey, Pop.

185
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:40,180
Hell of a thing, huh?

186
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:46,686
Good you came.

187
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:49,064
You were there for Lonnie at least, huh?

188
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,316
Yeah.

189
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:55,862
l sat down with Bill Avery and Armstrong.
We're gearing up task force.

190
00:10:57,156 --> 00:11:00,325
Yeah, well, everyone's gonna
want in on that.

191
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,410
You're gonna get all the oranges.

192
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:05,330
How about you throw your hat in the ring?
Make a phone call.

193
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,915
Me?

194
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,336
No. No, definitely not.

195
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,463
Don't you think it's time you got back. . .

196
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:16,299
. ..after two years on the tit
feeling sorry for yourself?

197
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:19,052
l don't feel sorry for myself.
l'm just not up for that.

198
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:23,014
How about Lonnie? You feel sorry for him?
His wife, his kids?

199
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:26,393
-You guys came up together.
-Oh, come on. Don't lay that on me, okay?

200
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,895
-lf it was you, he'd be all over this.
-Yeah.

201
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:31,272
-Be the first one signing up.
-l know that.

202
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:36,111
Not a goddamn thing l can do
for Lonnie now, Pop.

203
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:38,446
l held his hand
in the back of that ambulance. . .

204
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:40,782
. ..and even that didn't do any good.

205
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:44,369
He died looking into the face
of a friend, Raymond.

206
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,162
Yeah.

207
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:53,670
You're too smart not to know
that you're wasting your talent. . .

208
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:55,380
. ..in goddamn Missing Persons.

209
00:11:55,548 --> 00:12:01,136
-For you, it's a fucking dumping ground.
-Yeah, well, it doesn't bother me.

210
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:03,012
lt bothers you.

211
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:05,724
Yeah, look.

212
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,559
Pop, it's been a shitty night, okay?

213
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,936
l just wanna get out
of these fucking clothes. . .

214
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:12,147
. ..and wash this whole day off.
l'll see you.

215
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:14,315
Don't turn your back on me, Raymond.

216
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:18,653
You're my kid, my blood, but you
might as well be a fucking Martian.

217
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:20,780
Okay.

218
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:24,993
l'm gonna say what l'm gonna say,
and then l'm out of here.

219
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,829
l'm walking out, and it's over.

220
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:32,667
l want you on the task force.

221
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:36,212
But fuck if l'm gonna go after
a favor and have you run from it.

222
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:39,299
Now, the men who were killed
were under your brother's command.

223
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:40,800
You could be a benefit here...

224
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:43,595
. ..and show you're worth
all that early praise and promise.

225
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,848
Show everybody that gives a shit
that you haven't abandoned them.

226
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:50,185
Now, Raymond, do me a favor.
Forget the past.

227
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:52,312
Forget Mott Haven, all that shit.

228
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,940
Now is now. l know it's a hell of a thing
to break back in on. . .

229
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:59,819
. ..but you worked those streets. You know
the neighborhoods up and down. Yes?

230
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:01,696
Yeah, l worked those streets, Pop.

231
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,990
Okay, so you take the task-force spot...

232
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:06,951
. ..and you go at it
with all the gifts God gave you.

233
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,626
Cops died here, Raymond.

234
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,544
Four cops.

235
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:22,217
And no matter what we've forsaken
of ourselves, we can't forsake them.

236
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:26,054
Don't sit on your hands here, kiddo.

237
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:30,266
Don't sit on your hands here.

238
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:39,859
l knew you couldn't stay away
from all this forever.

239
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:41,402
Yeah, don't get used to it.

240
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:44,405
So, what do we got?
Crime Scene process these tracks?

241
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:45,907
Yeah, it's done.

242
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:49,869
They get anything off the canvass?
-Uh-uh. Still pending, bro.

243
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:51,496
So they found our guy up there?

244
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:54,999
Yeah, Gillick.
Must've went up when it popped off.

245
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,919
Got hit halfway up,
fell back on the landing.

246
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:01,422
Wait, they're still calling this a 91 1 , right?
Shots-fired call?

247
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,550
Yeah. Why?

248
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:07,011
Well. . . . l mean....

249
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,806
l don't know, man.
How you figure this went down?

250
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:13,643
l mean, our guys go in, maybe they
take down the guy right inside the door.

251
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:17,772
Then the whole thing touches off and you
got a lot of firing, very close quarters.

252
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:21,693
So that shooter, l mean, wherever he is,
he could've split, but he didn't.

253
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,862
He dug in, shot it out.

254
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:26,406
l mean, maybe he
surprised them somehow.

255
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:28,283
Maybe.

256
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:30,493
Somebody hit him.

257
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:34,497
He comes out,
catches Gillick coming up the stairs.

258
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:37,375
Then he comes down,
he's dumping blood all over the place.

259
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:40,253
And he splits for the street.
Then he does what?

260
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:43,172
He didn't hail a cab.
He have a car waiting?

261
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:46,384
Go.
-Could've jacked somebody.

262
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:51,347
Whoever he was, he was no amateur.

263
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:54,183
No, he's just a lucky
motherfucking perp, man.

264
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,146
Maybe.

265
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:00,982
What's up, Ray?

266
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,737
ls that you?

267
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:07,614
No.

268
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:09,490
ls that yours?

269
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,285
Where is that?

270
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:16,331
l got it, l got it.
-No, no, don't touch that. Don't touch that.

271
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:32,347
You got a bag?

272
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,725
All right. All right, listen up.
Here's what we got.

273
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:38,561
We ran the stamp name on the smack
recovered at the scene.

274
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:40,271
lt's called WMD.

275
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:44,317
Six hits, six names.
Their sheets and mug shots are inside.

276
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:48,196
Not a big group, so we should be able to
iso these fuckers and close them out.

277
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,114
So l'm gonna say it again.

278
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:52,492
Share your information. Anything.

279
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:56,079
Hints, hunches,
any scrap or shred of information.

280
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:59,582
l don't care if it goes off the back
of a matchbook, a strung-out Cl.

281
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,627
Put it inside the fives, get it in print
and get it to me.

282
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,087
-Where's our list?
l got it.

283
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:06,047
Anybody speak Spanish?

284
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:09,467
-Yeah, l'm all right. What's up?
-l need some help with an interview.

285
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,302
Hey, vouch that and do a dump on it.

286
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,805
-See how quick they can turn it around.
-All right.

287
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,473
-What's up?
-Got a kid inside. . .

288
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:19,310
. ..who might have seen something, but
l can't understand a word they're saying.

289
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,229
And papi's giving me a hard time.

290
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:24,857
-Yeah, all right. l'll give it a shot.
-All right.

291
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:44,085
Yeah, all of it.

292
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:48,548
That's right. Take it easy.
You hit the calm button, all right?

293
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:52,427
lf l gotta put an arm on you, you're
gonna spend Christmas in central booking.

294
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,130
He's just a little boy.
You don't understand.

295
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,132
No, l know, l know.

296
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,886
l just need him to point me
in the right direction. Please.

297
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:39,515
Come on, now. We really need
your help here. Just five minutes, okay?

298
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:47,565
Whoa, whoa, whoa. My man, calm down.
lt's the fucking holidays.

299
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,794
lt's Manny?

300
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:15,927
-You speak English okay, Manny?
-Uh-huh.

301
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,679
Okay. This is gonna be easy. Okay.

302
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:20,848
So....

303
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:23,101
Now, you remember last night?

304
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:25,353
There was some loud noises
across the street.

305
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,188
Guns?

306
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,774
Yeah, there were guns.
You know what guns sound like?

307
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,693
l hear them lots of times.

308
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:36,197
Yeah. Yeah, me too.

309
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:41,369
Okay, so when you heard the guns,
where were you?

310
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:44,080
Were you over by the door
in your daddy's shop?

311
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,289
Uh-huh.

312
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:48,709
Yeah? Could you see out onto the street?
Did you have a good view of the street?

313
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:50,128
Mm-hm.

314
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:53,548
Okay. Now, when the guns
stopped shooting...

315
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:59,011
. ..do you remember if a man ran out
from behind that building?

316
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:00,555
Uh-huh.

317
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:03,182
And did he get into a car?

318
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,768
-Uh-huh.
-He did.

319
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:08,563
Okay, now,
l want you to think for a second.

320
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,690
Did that man look like
he was hurt to you?

321
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:17,697
ln the leg, he was bleeding.

322
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:21,826
-ln the belly, he was--
-ln his belly?

323
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,119
Uh-huh.

324
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:28,082
Okay. Manny, that's the guy
that l'm looking for. Okay?

325
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:33,421
So l'm gonna show you some pictures.
Just a couple pictures of people.

326
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:38,092
And if you see the guy that you saw,
the guy who got in that car, you tell me.

327
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,594
Manny.

328
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:45,558
Okay? All right.

329
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:48,477
How about this guy?

330
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:50,938
ls that him?

331
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,321
How about him?

332
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:00,531
No?

333
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:05,286
How about him?

334
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,497
How about that one?

335
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,294
That's the man?

336
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,339
That's the man that you saw?

337
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:18,049
Mm-hm.

338
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:20,051
You sure?

339
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:24,805
Do you remember
what color that car was?

340
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:28,643
-Um. White.
-White.

341
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,978
-You sound pretty sure about that.
Uh-huh.

342
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:33,397
lt was a cab.

343
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:36,025
But not the yellow kind.

344
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:38,236
Manny, you're good, man.

345
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:41,614
You don't remember if it had two doors
or four doors, do you?

346
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:44,325
Um.... Four.

347
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,661
You have a great memory.

348
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:50,331
Anything else?
You remember anything else?

349
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,500
He looked scared.

350
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:55,544
Who? Who looked scared?

351
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:59,674
The man
driving the car. He looked...

352
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:02,176
...really scared.

353
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,158
What do we got?

354
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:31,122
lt's the fucking cabbie. Tezo must've
whacked him and had someone pick him up.

355
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,873
He's a fucking que paso, Jimmy.

356
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:36,210
Fucking termite choking on splinters,
had a run of good fucking luck.

357
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:38,087
No one's that fucking lucky, Kenny.

358
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:41,924
Tezo got tipped off our boys were
coming through that door to get him.

359
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:43,884
Christ.

360
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:46,345
You gotta give
the little fuck credit, though.

361
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:50,057
On the fly, under pressure?
lt's a fucking tight piece of work here.

362
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:53,269
We gotta find this guy, Jimmy.
We gotta kill this prick.

363
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:54,562
These guys were-- Jesus.

364
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,897
Hey, do me a big favor, all right?
All of you.

365
00:21:57,065 --> 00:22:00,318
Say nothing about this l don't already
know. lt's a waste of fucking words.

366
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:05,031
They're dead. Our money's missing. There's
only one of those things we can get back.

367
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:08,242
Yeah, we all loved those guys.

368
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:11,996
lt was a shitty way to punch out,
so pray they died quick and leave it alone.

369
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,165
First things first, we got handed up.

370
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,751
By who, we're gonna find out
real quick. Get the can.

371
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:18,836
We gotta pull the pin on this fuck now.

372
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:22,423
-The rat squad gets an angle on this--
-They'll blow our shit sky-high.

373
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:23,924
What about Casado?

374
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:27,386
What about him? Still wants Tezo
taken out. Nothing's changed.

375
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:29,597
How do we know Tezo
didn't jet out of town?

376
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:31,849
Because his fucking juice is here.

377
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:35,936
Goes somewhere else speaking next to no
English, he's fucking washing dishes.

378
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:38,564
Get it good, Kenny.

379
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:42,943
We leave nothing for them. We stay out
in front of the task force on this.

380
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:46,197
You got a gun, you got passport
to wherever this prick's holed up.

381
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:49,950
Toss every block in the five boroughs
till we find this piece of shit.

382
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:36,163
l'm sorry, Mr. Tezo.

383
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:37,998
l'm sorry.

384
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:42,670
Baby.

385
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,967
Bring me a potato.

386
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,302
l'm sorry.

387
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,304
Damn it. Fuck, l don't like that.

388
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:12,533
Okay, okay. l'm sorry.
lt hurts. l am sorry.

389
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:15,077
Hello?

390
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:25,546
Oh, you think?
-Shh. Shh. Shh.

391
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:28,549
l'm gonna fucking cut you, doc.

392
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:33,888
Okay, we are done.
That should do it for us.

393
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:39,560
We need money for this mamane,
this bullshit dagabanza.

394
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:46,400
Oh, very good.

395
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:50,112
Thank you.

396
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,198
Thank you, Mr. Tezo.

397
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:01,832
Hey, doc.

398
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:41,997
Hey, who's this?

399
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:44,333
Hey, Filk, it's Ray Tierney.

400
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:47,795
Yeah. Hey, can you
check something out for me?

401
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:51,298
That perp who was right inside the door,
the one who had his coat on?

402
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:54,176
Yeah, see if he got processed
that afternoon.

403
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:56,470
Yeah.

404
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:58,639
Hang on.

405
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:03,644
lt's Lupa. L-U-P-A. Sam--

406
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:05,938
Son of a bitch.

407
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:10,484
l got water in my bedroom.
Don't ask.

408
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:14,071
Sammy Lupa. Yeah.
lt's not on his sheet, but look at the--

409
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,948
Look at those photos. He's got--

410
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:18,742
He's got no laces in his shoes,
he's got no belt on.

411
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:21,328
l mean, what does that say to you?

412
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:24,290
Well, that's why l thought so.

413
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:27,001
All right, let me know.

414
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:30,921
Yeah. Merry Christmas. Bye.

415
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:34,091
Shit.

416
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:14,089
Hey.

417
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:16,383
You weren't gonna knock or anything?

418
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:19,136
Yeah, l wasn't sure--

419
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:23,057
l thought you'd be out, anyway.

420
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:25,768
Figured you were out
doing your last-minute shopping. . .

421
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:27,770
. ..tearing around, you know.

422
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:31,732
l found that a while ago.
l've been meaning to give it to you.

423
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:35,402
Thanks.

424
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:39,114
You gonna go your mom's?

425
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:42,576
-No, they're coming here.
-Oh.

426
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:44,662
My sister's in town with the kids.

427
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:47,873
Good. Good.

428
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:51,251
l miss them. Give them my love, okay?

429
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:57,007
You? You going over to your parents'?

430
00:27:57,592 --> 00:27:59,093
No.

431
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:04,056
We're gonna get everybody
over at Fran and Abby's this year.

432
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:08,769
Just better. You know?

433
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:10,229
How is she?

434
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:13,941
She's the same.

435
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:15,859
Franny, how's he holding up?

436
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:17,194
He's okay, l guess.

437
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:20,406
He doesn't talk that much about it.

438
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:25,536
But we had a bad couple days.

439
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:29,790
You heard?

440
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:32,835
Yeah, l heard.

441
00:28:34,003 --> 00:28:37,965
l know how close you and Lonnie were,
and l'm really sorry, Ray.

442
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:40,384
Would it have killed you to call me?

443
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:45,931
-We can't keep doing this.
-Doing what?

444
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:49,184
lt's Christmas morning.
You're leaving presents on my stoop. Why?

445
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:50,894
You're my wife for another month.

446
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:53,772
l can't leave you a Christmas present?
Are we down to that?

447
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,233
We have tried and we have tried, Ray.

448
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:58,193
We went over it and we went over it...

449
00:28:58,361 --> 00:29:00,654
. ..and we keep coming up
against the same wall.

450
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:02,698
Come on. Come on.

451
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:06,326
No. No. That's not true.

452
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:11,206
-Tash, if you knew how much--
-l know.

453
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:16,003
l feel the same way, Ray.

454
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:22,843
But l'm doing what l have to do.

455
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:26,346
This is what l need to do for me.

456
00:29:32,228 --> 00:29:33,854
Okay.

457
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,195
Have a merry Christmas, okay?

458
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:43,864
Yeah, you too. You too.

459
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:47,451
Okay. Okay, okay.

460
00:29:58,046 --> 00:29:59,880
Whole thing's fucked.

461
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:01,340
Tezo's gone with the wind. ..

462
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:05,177
. ..and we're out here doing this shit
on Christmas fucking morning.

463
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:07,846
Hey, fucko, you forget
four of our guys got killed?

464
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:12,684
Tezo was out of control. He was dishing
on the street, dealing his shit.

465
00:30:12,852 --> 00:30:16,063
The cocksucker was a fucking liability.

466
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:18,690
Lived by it, now he's
gonna fucking die by it.

467
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:20,567
Think Casado's any better?

468
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:22,528
Casado knows.

469
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:25,906
Keep it inside, man,
behind closed doors.

470
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:29,785
Out of sight, out of mind.
And the fucking envelope's on time.

471
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:31,912
The way it was.

472
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:33,831
Just the way it was.

473
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:45,259
You gotta keep your head up.
We're not paying the piper on this.

474
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:48,428
There's no way.
We're not going to fucking jail. Okay?

475
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:51,598
Family seeing us behind glass, fuck that.

476
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:54,309
Fuck that.

477
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:57,062
Fuck it. Come on.

478
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:59,773
Let's go pay Pepe a visit.

479
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:25,924
Let me get a couple AA batteries, bro.

480
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:29,303
Angel Tezo. You know him, right?

481
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:31,221
No, l don't.

482
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,308
-Angel Tezo, you know the cocksucker?
-No.

483
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:37,019
-You don't know Angel Tezo?
-No, l don't.

484
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:40,731
-Aah!
Fucking liar.

485
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:43,150
Try to be a fucking gentleman.
Get on your knees.

486
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:44,526
Get on your fucking knees!

487
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:46,236
-Tezo, where is he?
l don't know.

488
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:50,032
You think l don't know you're running
drugs here for him, you greasy fuck?

489
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:52,618
-Angel, you work for him? You feel that?
-Yes, l do.

490
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:55,203
-You do. Where is he?
-l don't know. l don't know.

491
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:59,249
You tell me where he is and you live.
-l don't know. l'm telling you, l don't know.

492
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:01,335
-l know you're hooked up.
-l don't know.

493
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:02,544
Where?
-l don't know!

494
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:06,173
l'm gonna put a bullet right in your head.
You're gonna die for that shit.

495
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:08,759
l'm gonna count to three,
then l'm gonna shoot you.

496
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:11,303
Where the fuck is he? Where is he? One.

497
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:13,764
l swear to God, l don't know!

498
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,599
-Where the fuck is he?
-l don't know!

499
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:16,975
One.
-Eddie!

500
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:18,810
-He knows where he is!
l don't know!

501
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:23,273
-Eddie. Eddie, he doesn't know where he is.
-He fucking knows! Back off! Two. Three!

502
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:26,610
-Eddie, what the fuck, bro?
Ha-ha-ha.

503
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:29,446

Think that's right to do that?
-Yep.

515
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:02,062
That is not right to do that, Bailey.

516
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:05,232
-lt is not right to do that.
-l could have you in cuffs.

00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:09,236
That's silly. l know what's gonna

You all right?

520

-Last chance to slip out the back.
-Not a chance.

521
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,504
All right.

You wanna come help Mo-Mo

525
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:35,554
Uh-huh.

526
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:39,433
Oh, good. We got stars, we got snowmen,
we got Santa Clauses. ...

527
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,770
-lf you forfeit the game, you lose.
-l didn't forfeit the game, l won.

528
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:48,608
And for you, mister, we got no more
of this. Come on, give me the drink.

529
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:50,027
-No, no.
-Give me the drink.

530
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:51,820
-You've had enough for a while.
-No.

531
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:53,321
-You've had enough.
-My dear.

533
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:25,479
What have you done?

534
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:30,442
FRANClS JR.
You gotta open it up to find out.

535
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:00,347
ls. . .?

536
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:03,600
Gaelic.

537
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:05,811
What does it say?

538
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:09,189
it says "Mo Cion Daonnan."

539
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:15,862
-What does that mean?
-lt means "My love eternal."

540
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:55,902

Sorry l'm late.

00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,708
There he is. There's Pop-Pop.

546
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:12,502
Can we open presents now?
-Merry Christmas. Not yet.

547
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:13,753
Merry Christmas, chief.

548
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:15,672
-Hey, Ma.
Merry Christmas.

549
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,383
There's my girl. How are you, buddy?

550
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:19,759
-You get good stuff?
-Yeah.

551
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:22,262
l heard Santa Claus
comes out of the chimney.

552
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,264
Whoa, it's a ball!

553
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:25,891
-What is that?
What about mine?

554
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:28,894
FRANClS SR.
No opening, not yet. We don't open yet.

555
00:36:29,061 --> 00:36:31,855
-Oh, look who's here.
-Ma, can we open the presents now?

556
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:34,441

-Hey there.
Merry Christmas.

559
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:44,326
Merry Christmas. You look so beautiful.
Doesn't she look beautiful?

560
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:46,411
FRANClS JR.
All right, Christmas time. Presents.

561
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:48,788
Merry Christmas, sweetheart.
You look beautiful.

562
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:49,956
Thank you so much.

563
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:52,375
Come on, Dad.
-Thank you. Merry Christmas.

564
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:54,294
All right, kids. Gifts. Gifts, gifts.

565
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:57,380
-Hi, handsome.
Hey.

566

-l'm okay, you know.
-Yeah? Did you see her?

568
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:05,972
Yeah, l went by this morning.

569
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,766
And?

570
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:11,311
lt's the same.

571
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:14,940
-Holy smokes.
One more.

572
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:16,233
Rescue gear.

573
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,819
- What's going on? Talk to me.
- Nothing. We ain't got shit.

574
00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:21,321
FRANClS JR.
What do you know about Tezo?

575
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:23,823
He's a lowlife dealer.
He operates a couple blocks.

576
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:25,951
So you're telling me we're in the clear?

577
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:28,662
Franny, l was with Jack Gillick
last week at the range--

578
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:30,622
-He didn't say anything?
-Not a word.

579
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:31,957
Are you sure about that?

580
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:34,334
My guys were doing something,
l'd know about it.

581
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:37,170
-We gotta get this guy.
-Give me a couple days. Let me ask.

582
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:39,547
-And we'll find out. Trust me.
-All right. Yeah.

583
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:42,592
Come on, we're missing Christmas.
Come on.

584
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:45,512
FRANClS JR.
All right, who wants ham?

585
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:49,182
- l need a knife.
- Hot stuff.

586
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:52,394

- Megan, this is....

587
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:55,063
- All right.
- There you are.

588
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:57,023
Franny.

589
00:37:58,192 --> 00:38:00,652
-Last but not least.
Oh, potatoes.

590
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:03,530
They don't want the
Brussels sprouts. That's a little big.

591
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:05,031
So we got sweet potatoes.

592
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:08,034
FRANClS SR.
Do these kids need any sweet potatoes?

593
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:11,621
-Only Monday of next week.
-Monday?

594
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:15,333
Well, yeah. lt wasn't just today, right?
l bring back souvenirs. . . .

595
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:17,585
Didn't that happen with Jimmy Jr.?

596
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:20,880
We went to the Poconos.
That was the first time we ever took a trip.

597
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:23,300
l'd like to go on a great vacation.

598
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,593
What are you talking about?

599
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:30,974
Wait three years and l'll take you
anywhere you want, sweetie pie.

600
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:40,734
So how you finding being back?

601
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:46,740
Good. l mean, l wish it was a better
circumstance, but we've got a good team.

602
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:49,576
-Guys treating you all right?
l worked with these guys.

603
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:51,703
-You remember Chris Miller?
-Yeah, yeah.

604
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:54,080
-l was on some cases with him.
-He's a good guy.

605
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:56,958
Yeah.
-lt's just like riding a bicycle.

606
00:38:57,126 --> 00:38:59,210
You never forget to ride a bicycle.

607
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:00,503
lt's just like him.

608
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:04,549
Look how happy you made the old man.
lt's the best Christmas present.

609
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:06,760
Caught a lucky break with that kid.

610
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:09,471
FRANClS SR.
There's nothing lucky about it.

611
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:12,640
You have the instinct for it.
You have the talent for it.

612
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:15,393
You can see everything
when they're kids.

613
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:17,437
l could see him when he was a kid.
Mm-hm.

614
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:21,524
He was the brains. He was the thinker.

615
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:23,443
He solved problems.

616
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:27,280
And that's what he does now as an adult,
he solves problems.

617
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:29,449
And he was always a leader.

618
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:32,869
He was a leader of men,
and people listened to Franny.

619
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:35,663
He has a personality.

620
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:41,294
He's gonna be a full inspector
before you know it, Abby.

621
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:45,131
And then there's my little baby girl there.

622
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:48,802
And she was always just
the way she is right now.

623
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:51,805
She had a heart
as big as the whole world.

624
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,724
As big as the whole world.

625
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:59,396
And that's why-- That's what she is now.
That's why she's a nurse.

626
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:01,439
My kids.

627
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:07,821
That's my kids.
Most important thing in the world.

628
00:40:07,988 --> 00:40:11,491
That's a pretty high bar we set,
me and Mo-Mo, huh?

629
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:13,076
Pretty high bar we set.

630
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:16,121
You're okay, old man.

631
00:40:16,872 --> 00:40:19,082
You're not bad yourself.

632
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:37,725
Shit.

633
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:40,687
Lisette.

634
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:51,823
Fuck, man! l fucking--

635
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:02,083
1 0-1 3, 1 0-1 3. ...

636
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:16,347
Okay, this is what we got.

637
00:41:16,515 --> 00:41:18,391
Number one's got a bullet in the head.

638
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:21,060
You're looking at an exit wound.
Went out the window.

639
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:25,064
Number two put his arm up, bullet went
through the arm and into the head.

640
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:28,568
Number three back here, he's been here
a couple days. He's a little ripe.

641
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:30,445
Took one to the back of the head.

642
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:34,240
And we don't really know
where the fuck he fits in just yet.

643
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:46,836
We're thinking that's the way he took off,
through that fucking window.

644
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:50,256
You wanna see the witness?

645
00:41:50,549 --> 00:41:51,841
-Yeah.
Look at me.

646
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:54,177
- She's back here.
- Hey, Lisette.

647
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:56,596
Now, fuck this
you-don't-understand-me bullshit.

648
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:58,431
Steve.

649
00:42:00,142 --> 00:42:03,019
Want you to meet Ray Tierney
from the task force.

650
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:05,104
-Hey, Ray.
-Hey. Ray.

651
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:07,023
How you doing?

00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:09,108
So, what do you got?

653
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:10,610
Well, she's pretty scattered.

654
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:13,655
About half a gram of coke, some hypos,
two decks of heroin. . .

655
00:42:13,822 --> 00:42:15,240
. ..you know, out of her purse.

656
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:17,450
-Why he didn't just waste her....
-Yeah.

657
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:18,618
What'd she say?

658
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:21,829
Nothing l can understand.
lt's all ghetto shit.

659
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:23,456
-Can l have a few minutes?
-Yeah.

660
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:25,625
-Get a crack at it?
-Yeah, sure.

661
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:36,344
Lisette.

662
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:07,333
ls that your little girl?

663
00:43:09,878 --> 00:43:12,630
You're gonna lose her.
We're gonna bust you for possession.

664
00:43:12,798 --> 00:43:15,049
Child Services is gonna
take her away from you.

665
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:18,511
ls that what you want to happen?
ls that what you want?

666
00:43:19,054 --> 00:43:20,763
Wait a minute, what is that?

667
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:24,058
What's this? What is this?

668
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:29,731
What happened there?

669
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:32,275
He do that to you?
Did Tezo do that to you?

670
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:36,529
Did he, Lisette?
Did he put that gun to your head?

671
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,827
What happened?

672
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:59,844
-Has anybody looked at her?
There's a bus on its way.

673
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:03,973
Okay. Look, l wanna help you, okay?

674
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:06,267
But you gotta give me something.

675
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:12,315
l know you got something.
Give me something.

676
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:17,654
Who?

677
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,114
Sandy.

678
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:26,537
Sandy helped him escape. Who's Sandy?

679
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:43,930
What?

680
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:51,979
She talking about us?
-No. Shh. Shh.

681
00:44:54,441 --> 00:44:56,943
Hey, look at me. Look at me.

682
00:44:58,737 --> 00:45:00,071
Sandy's policia?

683
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:02,782
Tezo's friend's a cop?

684
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,708
lf you're lying to me. ..

685
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:14,627
. .. l'm gonna take your fucking kid
away from you.

686
00:45:17,172 --> 00:45:20,216
She's bugging out.
She doesn't know what she's saying.

687
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:22,635
l tell you what, do me a favor.

688
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:25,888
Hold on to her till she gets straight.
l'll meet you at the house.

689
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:27,598
-All right.
-Nobody talks to her.

690
00:45:27,766 --> 00:45:28,808
-All right.
-Okay?

691
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:31,269
-l'll handle it.
-Thanks.

692
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:20,193
Why does a man choose
to be a police officer?

693
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:25,031
What kind of man gets up in the morning,
showers, shaves, and goes to work. . .

694
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:28,993
. ..not knowing whether he'll be alive
at the end of the day?

695
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:34,415
What kind of man has the courage
to stand at the door of the temple. . .

696
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:40,046
. ..and say to those who seek to corrupt,

697
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:44,717
"Not on my watch.
You will not harm one of mine"?

698
00:46:45,552 --> 00:46:47,887
Lonnie Mercer was that kind of man.

699
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:51,265
As we commit his body to the earth. . .

700
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:54,727
. ..we ask God to take Lonnie's soul
into everlasting light.

701
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:58,648
May his soul rest in peace.

702
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:00,691
Amen.

703
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:09,075
Present arms.

704
00:47:42,484 --> 00:47:43,943
Hey.

705
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:45,736
Franny.

706
00:47:46,905 --> 00:47:48,614
Hey, Ray.
-Hey.

707
00:47:49,783 --> 00:47:52,201
-How you doing?
-l'm okay.

708
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:54,453
-Hey, you did good.
-You think so?

709
00:47:54,621 --> 00:47:56,205
-Yeah.
-Thanks.

710
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:58,082
Yeah.

711
00:47:58,625 --> 00:47:59,917
Wanna get a cup of coffee?

712
00:48:00,085 --> 00:48:04,130
l gotta go home and see Abby and the kids.
Wanna spend the day with them, you know?

713
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:07,466
Sure, yeah. Listen, l gotta talk to you
about some things.

714
00:48:07,634 --> 00:48:09,552
Okay. What's up?

715
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:14,515
You and Jimmy coming up with anything
about why your guys were in that building?

716
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:17,059
No, Ray. They were just
being cops, you know?

717
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:21,689
Are you sure your guys didn't run
a plant-and-bust on Tezo that day?

718
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:25,067
lt feels like they popped that guy
on nickel-and-dime shit...

719
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:27,236
. ..so they could use him on a door knock.

720
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:30,990
l know these SNEU guys.
They'll go around a warrant doing that.

721
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:33,200
l need to know
if you were giving them that.

722
00:48:33,368 --> 00:48:36,245
Wait a minute. What are you saying?
Did l miss something here?

723
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:39,665
Did you already catch the scumbag
that killed four of my guys? Did you?

724
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:41,083
Listen to me. Listen.

725
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:45,087
We found a cell phone outside
of that apartment. lt was Tezo's.

726
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:48,174
We dumped it. Somebody called him
right before our guys went in.

727
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:51,677
Now, l checked it against the trace
on that 91 1 call.

728
00:48:51,845 --> 00:48:54,180
lt's the same number, Fran.

729
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:58,517
And you know where the call came from?
lt came from Coney lsland.

730
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:02,563
How are shots fired in Washington Heights
heard in Brooklyn?

731
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:04,732
-l don't know. You tell me.
-Tell me that.

732
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:07,693
Half your guys were at that
football game, okay?

733
00:49:07,861 --> 00:49:10,571
lf you were gonna pull a sting,
that would be a good time.

734
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:13,991
Look, l'm not trying to put you on the spot.
l'm helping. l'm trying--

735
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:16,702
Do you wanna help me?
Do you wanna fucking help me?

736
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:19,163
You find that scumbag
that killed four of my guys.

737
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:21,082
Yeah. Hey, hey, that's what l'm doing.

738
00:49:21,249 --> 00:49:24,877
Listen to me. Listen to me.
l talked to this broad Lisette.

739
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:29,382
She says that a friend of his called him
and tipped him that our guys were coming.

740
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:34,387
She says it was a cop, Franny.
She said, "La policia. "

741
00:49:34,554 --> 00:49:37,223
She said it was someone named Sandy.

742
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:40,351
You got any cops in your precinct
named Sandy?

743
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:41,852
No.

744
00:49:42,354 --> 00:49:43,396
No nicknames, nothing?

745
00:49:43,563 --> 00:49:46,816
-l said l don't know anyone named Sandy.
-Okay, okay, listen.

746
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:49,276
l have not shared this around, Franny.

747
00:49:49,444 --> 00:49:53,447
lt is not gonna take peerless detective work
for someone else to connect these dots.

748
00:49:53,615 --> 00:49:55,700
l know you're trying to protect your guys...

749
00:49:55,867 --> 00:50:00,079
-. . .but you gotta get--
-Protect? Protect? They're gone, Raymond.

750
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:04,208
Freddie, Jack, Billy, Lonnie.
They're all dead.

751
00:50:04,376 --> 00:50:06,752
What the fuck do l gotta
protect them from now, huh?

752
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:11,257
Fran. l'm trying to protect you.

753
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:16,012
You know, these questions are gonna come,
Fran. We gotta start dealing with it.

754
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:21,934
Find fucking Tezo, Ray,
all right? Do me a favor.

755
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:34,655
FRANClS SR.
Anybody in?

756
00:50:34,823 --> 00:50:36,282
Yeah.

757
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:42,955
-Hey.
-Hey.

758
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:44,665
Come on in.

759
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:48,794
What happened?

760
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:53,966
My carpet. What happened to the carpet?

761
00:50:54,634 --> 00:50:58,304
You're supposed to fix the leaks before you
put the carpet down, Pop. You know that?

762
00:50:58,472 --> 00:50:59,764
Oh.. . .

763
00:51:00,265 --> 00:51:03,934
Boats leak, Raymond.
lt's the nature of things.

764
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:07,646
Close the door, will you?

765
00:51:13,779 --> 00:51:15,279
There you go.

766
00:51:15,864 --> 00:51:19,825
-Have a few nips this evening, Pop?
-Had a glass of Scotch, officer.

767
00:51:19,993 --> 00:51:21,118
Just one, huh?

768
00:51:21,828 --> 00:51:23,496
l used the same glass, yeah.

769
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:27,333
Let me put on a pot of coffee.

770
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:32,379
Oh, boy.

771
00:51:33,673 --> 00:51:36,133
Got some memories in this tub.

772
00:51:36,301 --> 00:51:38,177
Here. Drink that.

773
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:42,098
lt's nice and warm.

774
00:51:44,893 --> 00:51:47,019
Your brother called me.

775
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:49,814
Oh, yeah? Did he get something?

776
00:51:49,981 --> 00:51:52,525
Ears to the ground,
but they're getting blanked.

777
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:56,278
He said you came at him a little bit.

778
00:51:58,406 --> 00:52:00,991
Asking about his boys,
how they were operating.

779
00:52:01,159 --> 00:52:03,994
l ran up against some shit
didn't feel right.

780
00:52:04,871 --> 00:52:07,540
l went to see if Franny and Jimmy
could clear it up for me.

781
00:52:07,707 --> 00:52:11,043
But it didn't file?
You didn't put it down in the fives?

782
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:13,671
No, l didn't put it in the fives yet.

783
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:15,297
But some of it, Pop, l gotta.

784
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:18,300
Raymond, you got
something case-pertinent. ..

785
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:22,054
. ..help us catch this cocksucker,
by all means, share.

786
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:24,056
But you start looking for loose ends. . .

787
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:27,643
. ..where your brother's boys
are concerned, where's that gonna fall?

788
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:30,938
You think l'm not thinking about that?
This isn't loose ends.

789
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:34,984
Pop, l got the shooter's girl saying....

790
00:52:35,777 --> 00:52:38,279
Saying that he got tipped off.

791
00:52:38,446 --> 00:52:40,739
And she says it was a cop
that made the call.

792
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:47,955
Are you telling me
we're gonna suppress that?

793
00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:50,040
Not suppress, Raymond.

794
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:53,419
Sit on, for the moment,
anything that might go sideways on us.

795
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:55,129
Oh, come on. lt's the same thing.

796
00:52:55,297 --> 00:52:57,673
You know what position
that's gonna put me in?

797
00:52:57,841 --> 00:53:00,092
Raymond, eight years
as a Major Case narc...

798
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:03,762
. ..and you never let something settle
before you put it in print?

799
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:06,891
Made sure it wasn't gonna come back,
bite you, jam you up?

800
00:53:07,058 --> 00:53:09,602
l'm not looking to jam anybody up,
not intentionally.

801
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:11,896
lntentionally, unintentionally.
Doesn't matter.

802
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:15,065
Anything that makes cops look culpable
is no good, Raymond.

803
00:53:17,777 --> 00:53:19,403
What do you want me to do with it?

804
00:53:20,113 --> 00:53:22,448
-You want me to spell it out for you?
-Yeah.

805
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:26,744
Stay on point. Keep your focus
on finding the fuck who killed our guys.

806
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:29,246
And if you find anything else
that seems off. ..

807
00:53:29,414 --> 00:53:33,459
. ..you come to me
and we deal with it. Okay?

808
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:35,586
lf you say so.

809
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:40,424
l say so.

810
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:43,594
Okay.

811
00:53:51,436 --> 00:53:53,312
-Hey, Lou, you still here?
Yes, boss.

812
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:56,482
No one goes downstairs.
-You got it, boss.

813
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:08,160
Hey, Sandy.

814
00:54:10,372 --> 00:54:14,083
Hey, boss.
What are you doing here this late?

815
00:54:16,002 --> 00:54:17,670
Come here.

816
00:54:23,468 --> 00:54:26,136
Hey, guys. Clear it out.

817
00:54:26,554 --> 00:54:29,723
Zach, take it upstairs.

818
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:38,399
What's up?

819
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:42,111
l'm gonna ask you this one time, Sandy.

820
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:43,862
Okay.

821
00:54:44,322 --> 00:54:47,741
And if your first impulse is to lie,
you better fucking resist like hell.

822
00:54:47,909 --> 00:54:49,952
Boss, what are you talking about?

823
00:54:51,579 --> 00:54:53,163
Angel Tezo.

824
00:54:54,874 --> 00:54:56,375
Yeah?

825
00:54:57,502 --> 00:55:00,379
This girl they hauled in
up in the Bronx, Lisette Rivera.. .

826
00:55:01,881 --> 00:55:03,966
. ..she was the last one with him.

827
00:55:04,342 --> 00:55:08,053
She said a cop tipped Tezo off
to the Washington Heights raid.

828
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:11,390
She said this cop
went by the name Sandy.

829
00:55:12,183 --> 00:55:14,852
-Really?
-Yeah, really.

830
00:55:15,729 --> 00:55:17,479
Well, shit, l don't know no--

831
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:18,814
You set them up to die?

832
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:20,399
-Your own men!
-l didn't know.

833
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:24,403
-You let them walk into that?
-l didn't know! Jesus Christ, cap, please.

834
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:28,240
He was-- l've known him since we
were kids. He was my ex-wife's cousin.

835
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:30,117
You fucking piece of shit!

836

l didn't know he'd stay.

837
00:55:33,913 --> 00:55:35,122
You didn't know he'd stay?

838
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:37,541

it would end up like that!

839
00:55:37,709 --> 00:55:39,543
What did you think would happen, Sandy?

840
00:55:39,711 --> 00:55:42,921
They were going in there to kill him.
Egan said for them to kill him.

841
00:55:43,089 --> 00:55:44,673
What--? What?

842
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:46,717
Jimmy? Jimmy Egan said what?

843
00:55:46,885 --> 00:55:49,428
He wanted Tezo dead.

Are you fucking telling me Jimmy Egan

846
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:58,187
Kill Tezo, steal his shit,
get into business with Casado.

847
00:55:58,355 --> 00:56:00,439
That was the deal.

848

You're telling me the fucking SNEU team
was going after drug dealers?

849
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:14,620
That Jimmy Egan was fucking putting hits
out on people for fucking money?

850
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:17,122
-That's what you were doing on the street?
-Yeah.

851
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:19,875
And you dealt with that
by setting up your own crew?

852
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:21,835
By sending them into a fucking ambush?

853
00:56:22,003 --> 00:56:24,922
You don't call me?
You don't fucking come to me, Sandy?

854
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:28,133

We're here to trade.
You gotta sell me something.

No, Ray, no, no, last one. All right.
All right. All right.

1031

01:09:56,525 --> 01:09:59,819
Yeah, no, l know. l know,

Shit.

Go away.

1041
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:48,946
Get him up, man!

1042
01:12:49,114 --> 01:12:51,741
Pig! Get the fuck off me!

1043
01:12:53,702 --> 01:12:54,952
Fuck you!

1044
01:13:03,170 --> 01:13:05,171
Open his fucking mouth.

1045
01:13:13,472 --> 01:13:15,348
Give me something.

1046
01:13:16,767 --> 01:13:17,809
Give me something.

1047
01:13:17,976 --> 01:13:19,018
Fucking answer.

1048
01:13:21,814 --> 01:13:24,107
l want a fucking name.

1049
01:13:28,445 --> 01:13:29,987
Sandy.

1050
01:13:30,155 --> 01:13:31,948
Finish him.

1051
01:13:33,367 --> 01:13:34,492
Jimmy.

1052
01:13:35,327 --> 01:13:36,702
Hey, no, no! lt's Ray!

1053
01:13:36,870 --> 01:13:39,997
-Ray? Ray, we got him.
-Jimmy, what the fuck is going on here?

1054
01:13:40,165 --> 01:13:41,207
-We got him.
-What?

1055
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:43,793
-We got him.
-What are you guys even doing here?

1056
01:13:43,961 --> 01:13:45,503
-What is he--?
lt's handled, Ray.

1057
01:13:45,671 --> 01:13:48,214
What do you mean, it's handled?
What are you--? Come on!

1058
01:13:48,382 --> 01:13:50,133
Hey. Enough. Enough.

1059
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:51,843
-Oh, my God.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1060
01:13:52,010 --> 01:13:53,761
-Don't fucking take it out!
-Hey, hey.

1061
01:13:53,929 --> 01:13:55,471
-Motherfucker.
-Don't take it out.

1062
01:13:55,639 --> 01:13:58,015
-Take your hands off of me.
Ray, put the gun away.

1063
01:13:58,183 --> 01:14:00,101
Put your hand on me again, asshole.

1064
01:14:05,357 --> 01:14:07,066
Oh, my God.

1065
01:14:07,234 --> 01:14:10,862
-Fuck him, he's done.
-He's not done. He's alive.

1066
01:14:13,699 --> 01:14:18,244
Jesus.

1067
01:14:22,833 --> 01:14:24,333
He's dead.

1068
01:14:25,502 --> 01:14:26,544
Jimmy.

1069
01:14:28,755 --> 01:14:30,882
Good work, Ray.

1070
01:14:31,341 --> 01:14:33,050
Good work.

1071
01:14:39,892 --> 01:14:43,436
You motherfucker! You motherfucker!
What the fuck are you thinking?

1072
01:14:43,604 --> 01:14:45,354
-Get back.
-Have you lost your mind?

1073
01:14:45,522 --> 01:14:46,981
Ray.

1074
01:14:49,526 --> 01:14:53,779
l fucking love you, Ray.
You know l do. You're family.

1075
01:14:54,990 --> 01:14:56,908
Your backup's coming.

1076
01:14:57,201 --> 01:14:58,910
So here's what happened.

1077
01:14:59,077 --> 01:15:01,913
Now, you got here first. He resisted.

1078
01:15:02,706 --> 01:15:04,832
You had to put three in him.

1079
01:15:05,792 --> 01:15:07,084
lt was a clean shoot.

1080
01:15:08,295 --> 01:15:11,881
-You have lost your fucking mind.
-You're a cop, Ray.

1081
01:15:12,132 --> 01:15:13,466
Just like us.

1082
01:15:13,926 --> 01:15:16,052
You're a fucking cop.

1083
01:15:18,096 --> 01:15:22,183
-Get your fucking hands off me. Get off me.
-Let him go. Let him go. Let him go.

1084
01:15:22,434 --> 01:15:24,727
He knows what he's
gotta do here, right, Jimmy?

1085
01:15:25,604 --> 01:15:27,480
Yeah. lt's gonna be all right.

1086
01:15:43,622 --> 01:15:45,957
You talk to him?
No. Look, Ray--

1087
01:15:46,124 --> 01:15:49,961
-What are you doing here? Talk to him.
-Calm down. We're gonna figure this out.

1088
01:15:50,128 --> 01:15:53,381
Was there static on the line?
Did you hear what l fucking said?

1089
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:58,177
Jimmy executed him. He took my fucking
gun off me, Francis, and shot him.

1090
01:15:58,345 --> 01:16:01,055
What the fuck is going on here?
Did you send him in there?

1091
01:16:01,223 --> 01:16:04,392
-What did you know? Were you in on this?
-No, l didn't know, Ray.

1092
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:07,270
You didn't know like
you didn't know about Sandy?

1093
01:16:07,813 --> 01:16:11,816
l come to you and l asked you if you had
a cop in your precinct named Sandy.

1094
01:16:11,984 --> 01:16:14,485
A nickname, l said.
Tell me you weren't lying to me.

1095
01:16:14,653 --> 01:16:17,530
l needed to find out for myself.
You've been gone a long time.

1096
01:16:17,698 --> 01:16:20,658
Come on.
l came to you to try to help you.

1097
01:16:20,826 --> 01:16:24,787
Do you have any idea what Jimmy's been
doing under your roof? Do you even care?

1098
01:16:24,955 --> 01:16:26,289
l'm doing my best. All right?

1099
01:16:26,456 --> 01:16:30,167
l'm in the hospital all day with my wife,
who's fucking dying.

1100
01:16:32,713 --> 01:16:36,215
Look, l know Jimmy's out of control.
Believe me, l'm gonna take care of him.

1101
01:16:36,383 --> 01:16:39,510
But you and l, we gotta keep
our heads up here, Ray.

1102
01:16:39,678 --> 01:16:42,388
We gotta handle this so no one else
gets hurt. You hear me?

1103
01:16:42,556 --> 01:16:43,848
We're not gonna handle this.

1104
01:16:44,016 --> 01:16:47,476
What do you think? You think we're
gonna go with Pop and smooth this over?

1105
01:16:47,644 --> 01:16:51,147
That is not gonna happen. This isn't
Mott Haven. l won't stand up for that.

1106
01:16:51,315 --> 01:16:54,233
You know, it's not Mott Haven.
This is not about the department.

1107
01:16:54,401 --> 01:16:58,863
This is about me. My command.
All this shit falls on me, Ray.

1108
01:16:59,031 --> 01:17:02,533
So, what do you wanna do? You wanna
cut me off at the fucking knees?

1109
01:17:02,701 --> 01:17:04,577
You wanna watch me go down in flames?

1110
01:17:04,745 --> 01:17:07,580
ls that gonna satisfy your sense
of right and wrong?

1111
01:17:08,373 --> 01:17:10,666
We got an out here, Ray.

1112
01:17:13,754 --> 01:17:16,088
Jesus, Francis.

1113
01:17:20,552 --> 01:17:22,720
l know this is fucked up, okay?

1114
01:17:22,888 --> 01:17:24,889
But l need you.

1115
01:17:27,184 --> 01:17:29,769
This is fucking you and me.

1116
01:17:31,647 --> 01:17:34,732
When we were kids,
all we ever talked about was being cops.

1117
01:17:35,567 --> 01:17:39,403
How the fuck did we end up at this?

1118
01:17:46,662 --> 01:17:48,704
What are you gonna do, Ray?

1119
01:17:50,707 --> 01:17:52,249
l don't know.

1120
01:17:53,251 --> 01:17:56,128
l don't know.
l'm gonna get this fucking blood off me.

1121
01:17:57,422 --> 01:17:58,964
FRANClS JR.
Ray.

1122
01:18:15,482 --> 01:18:18,901
You were gone a long time.
Where were you?

1123
01:18:19,069 --> 01:18:20,528
FRANClS JR.
Uh. . ..

1124
01:18:21,363 --> 01:18:22,947
l just. ...

1125
01:18:23,782 --> 01:18:26,534
l just had to talk to Ray
about something.

1126
01:18:27,035 --> 01:18:29,036
What is it, Francis?

1127
01:18:29,204 --> 01:18:31,372
ls everything okay?

1128
01:18:35,794 --> 01:18:38,045
You know, Ab, it's not.

1129
01:18:39,548 --> 01:18:40,756
What's going on?

1130
01:18:43,593 --> 01:18:45,594
Oh, fuck, Abby.

1131
01:18:45,762 --> 01:18:49,140
Oh, Francis, talk to me.

1132
01:18:49,307 --> 01:18:52,893
l mean, don't not tell me
something which is....

1133
01:18:56,273 --> 01:18:58,190
Because. ...

1134
01:19:02,988 --> 01:19:05,197
Those men, Abby.

1135
01:19:07,659 --> 01:19:09,827
Those four cops.

1136
01:19:12,456 --> 01:19:15,040
l am right in the middle of something. . .

1137
01:19:16,668 --> 01:19:19,336
. ..and l don't know
how to get out of it.

1138
01:19:22,424 --> 01:19:25,634
And l am really fucking scared.

1139
01:19:40,984 --> 01:19:42,735
Can...

1140
01:19:43,528 --> 01:19:45,488
. ..you see how to. . .

1141
01:19:47,449 --> 01:19:49,700
. ..make it right?

1142
01:19:55,499 --> 01:19:57,208
Not without.. . .

1143
01:19:58,877 --> 01:20:05,466
Not without ruining everything
l've been working for.

1144
01:20:08,762 --> 01:20:11,263
You're a good man, Francis.

1145
01:20:11,723 --> 01:20:13,682
l don't know how... .

1146
01:20:14,142 --> 01:20:15,684
How... .

1147
01:20:17,229 --> 01:20:19,396
How you got yourself... .

1148
01:20:22,484 --> 01:20:26,070
l trust you with my children.

1149
01:20:26,530 --> 01:20:30,574
l need you to be that man.

1150
01:20:35,038 --> 01:20:37,414
Do you hear what l'm saying?

1151
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,501
Yeah.

1152
01:20:50,595 --> 01:20:52,930
l got your back, Abby.

1153
01:20:55,559 --> 01:20:58,102
A neighbor says she saw
three men she can't identify...

1154
01:20:58,270 --> 01:21:01,730
. ..get out of a yellow, possibly gold,
'80s Monte Carlo or Grand Prix...

1155
01:21:01,898 --> 01:21:05,276
. ..and enter the building where
Angel Tezo was later found shot dead.

1156
01:21:05,443 --> 01:21:07,486
EMT on the scene confirmed,
off the record...

1157
01:21:07,654 --> 01:21:10,114
. ..that the victim suffered
a crushed larynx.

1158
01:21:10,282 --> 01:21:13,200
-At the coroner's office--
-Hey, Carlos, you have a call on one.

1159
01:21:13,368 --> 01:21:14,410
Who is it?
-Won't say.

1160
01:21:14,578 --> 01:21:16,495
--killed after exchanging gunfire with--

1161
01:21:16,663 --> 01:21:20,499
The coroner's office has yet
to release a copy of the autopsy report...

1162
01:21:20,667 --> 01:21:22,877
. ..nor have they returned
any of my phone calls.

1163
01:21:23,044 --> 01:21:25,671
--responsible for the
slaying of four New York City cops.

1164
01:21:25,839 --> 01:21:27,047
Hey, guys.

1165
01:21:27,215 --> 01:21:29,967

-Do l know--? Hey, who is this?

1167
01:21:36,808 --> 01:21:40,769
All right. Okay, slow down.
Slow down. Slow down.

1168
01:21:41,104 --> 01:21:44,315
All right. You have to give me some--

1169
01:21:44,482 --> 01:21:46,567
You have to give me something small.

1170
01:21:50,739 --> 01:21:52,156
Uh-huh.

1171
01:21:57,287 --> 01:22:00,789
Okay. And, look, l'm gonna need a name.

1172
01:22:48,296 --> 01:22:49,713
Are you alone?

1173
01:22:49,881 --> 01:22:51,882
Yeah.
-Don't fuck with me, man.

1174
01:22:52,050 --> 01:22:56,053
-l swear to God, don't fuck with me.
-l'm not, man. l'm being straight.

1175
01:22:56,221 --> 01:22:58,847
Nobody knows l'm here,
nobody knows you're here.

1176
01:23:04,646 --> 01:23:06,647
You recording this?

1177
01:23:07,065 --> 01:23:08,649
Do you want me to?

1178
01:23:08,817 --> 01:23:09,942
You got a recorder?

1179
01:23:10,110 --> 01:23:11,151
No.

1180
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:15,447
Then l don't want you to record it.

1181
01:23:15,740 --> 01:23:17,157
Okay.

1182
01:23:19,411 --> 01:23:22,413
All right, look, you could just. . . .
You just talk, all right?

1183
01:23:22,580 --> 01:23:25,749
Tell me anything you wanna say,
l won't interrupt you. Say whatever.

1184
01:23:25,917 --> 01:23:28,627
So you can get my story, right?
So you can fuck me.

1185
01:23:28,795 --> 01:23:32,006
-Turn my name to shit, is that it?
-Hey, Sandy. You called me.

1186
01:23:32,173 --> 01:23:34,675
l'm not a priest, l'm a writer.

1187
01:23:35,844 --> 01:23:40,514
l came down here to freeze my ass off
sitting in this fucking car. l did my part.

1188
01:23:43,935 --> 01:23:46,603
l gotta get this out of me.

1189
01:23:48,106 --> 01:23:51,066
-l gotta get this out.
-What?

1190
01:23:51,651 --> 01:23:53,610
We're all dirty.

1191
01:23:55,155 --> 01:23:59,366
We sold our shields off,
highest bidder, murder for hire.

1192
01:24:01,119 --> 01:24:05,289
Stole drugs off dead men, planted shit. . .

1193
01:24:06,624 --> 01:24:07,750
. ..beat suspects.

1194
01:24:07,917 --> 01:24:10,836
We robbed and. . . .

1195
01:24:17,844 --> 01:24:21,764
We condemned four of our own to die.

1196
01:24:22,849 --> 01:24:25,142
-What are you talking about?
-Washington Heights.

1197
01:24:26,019 --> 01:24:28,312
We sent them into a slaughter.

1198
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:33,484
-Who? Who, Sandy? Who sent those men?
-l fucking told you, no names!

1199
01:24:33,651 --> 01:24:36,695
l'm sorry. l'm sorry.

1200
01:24:39,365 --> 01:24:41,617
l can't undo it now.

1201
01:24:42,535 --> 01:24:44,703
There's no atoning.

1202
01:24:45,497 --> 01:24:48,415
l'm gonna burn, man.
l'm gonna fucking burn.

1203
01:24:48,583 --> 01:24:51,001
No, no, no. No, this is--
We can work this out, okay?

1204
01:24:51,169 --> 01:24:54,379
No, no, no.
-Look, l'm gonna call my city desk.

1205
01:24:54,547 --> 01:24:57,007
All right? l'm gonna call my editor.
All right?

1206
01:24:57,175 --> 01:25:00,135
To save space for your story, okay?
Your story.

1207
01:25:01,346 --> 01:25:02,846
Okay?

1208
01:25:04,390 --> 01:25:06,350
Becoming a cop. . .

1209
01:25:09,270 --> 01:25:11,730
. ..the respect that earned us...

1210
01:25:15,735 --> 01:25:17,361
. ..the pledge we took. . .

1211
01:25:18,571 --> 01:25:21,323
. ..to uphold something honest....

1212
01:25:22,033 --> 01:25:26,286
Being in the blue, wearing that shield...

1213
01:25:30,875 --> 01:25:33,377
. ..the pride that l felt...

1214
01:25:35,713 --> 01:25:37,840
. ..the fucking glory. . . .

1215
01:25:41,928 --> 01:25:44,513
We let it all go out from under us.

1216
01:25:53,314 --> 01:25:55,649
l was a good man once.

1217
01:26:52,749 --> 01:26:54,791
Who is it?

1218
01:26:54,959 --> 01:26:56,460
lt's Kenny.

1219
01:26:56,628 --> 01:26:57,961
What does he want?

1220
01:26:58,129 --> 01:27:00,797
l just got up.
How the fuck should l know?

1221
01:27:04,469 --> 01:27:06,803
Jesus Christ.

1222
01:27:10,350 --> 01:27:12,476
We're about to get fucked.

1223
01:27:12,644 --> 01:27:14,311
He's dead. Jimmy, he's fucking dead.

1224
01:27:14,479 --> 01:27:16,021
Sandy fucking killed himself.

1225
01:27:16,189 --> 01:27:17,940
Shh. Come on.

1226
01:27:18,107 --> 01:27:19,233
Ladies and gentlemen...

1227
01:27:20,026 --> 01:27:23,362
. ..it is with sorrow
and a deep sense of regret. . .

1228
01:27:23,529 --> 01:27:26,240
. ..that l appear before you today.

1229
01:27:27,325 --> 01:27:29,076
At 1 0:30 p.m. last night. ..

1230
01:27:29,494 --> 01:27:34,122
. ..Officer Ruben Santiago of the
31 st Precinct in Washington Heights. . .

1231
01:27:34,832 --> 01:27:36,416
. ..took his own life.

1232
01:27:36,584 --> 01:27:38,919
Officer Santiago...

1233
01:27:39,087 --> 01:27:43,048
. ..along with the four officers slain
in Washington Heights...

1234
01:27:43,216 --> 01:27:46,593
. ..had formed an illicit criminal cabal.

1235
01:27:46,761 --> 01:27:50,347
Working in collusion
and under the aegis of the N.Y.P.D. . .

1236
01:27:50,515 --> 01:27:54,476
. ..these officers undertook all manner
of criminal misdeed.

1237
01:27:54,644 --> 01:27:57,854
lnvestigators from lnternal Affairs
have isolated the involvement...

1238
01:27:58,022 --> 01:27:59,356
FRANClS JR.
Where the hell have you been?

1239
01:27:59,524 --> 01:28:00,565
...of this rogue unit. ..

1240
01:28:00,733 --> 01:28:02,943
-. . .to the deceased men.
-Yeah, we need to talk.

1241
01:28:03,111 --> 01:28:06,613
-No other officer in 31 st Precinct. . .
-Yeah, okay. Tonight.

1242
01:28:06,781 --> 01:28:08,991
-. . .has been found culpable of. . .
-You be there.

1243
01:28:09,158 --> 01:28:12,160
. ..or in any way linked
to this criminal conspiracy.

1244
01:28:12,328 --> 01:28:14,121
FRANClS SR.
Francis.

1245
01:28:16,416 --> 01:28:18,250
Francis.

1246
01:28:19,210 --> 01:28:20,711
What the hell is going on here?

1247
01:28:20,878 --> 01:28:24,840
-l can't talk, Pop, l gotta go.
-What the hell is going on here, Francis?

1248
01:28:25,174 --> 01:28:27,342
How involved are you?

1249
01:28:28,970 --> 01:28:32,514
Look at me.

1250
01:28:36,311 --> 01:28:38,020
Did you know what they were doing?

1251
01:28:39,105 --> 01:28:41,064
l knew enough.

1252
01:28:45,695 --> 01:28:49,323
Dad, come on, man. All those years,
you never got jammed up?

1253
01:28:49,490 --> 01:28:52,576
-lt never came down on top of you?
-No.

1254
01:28:53,077 --> 01:28:54,494
Because l kept my head up.

1255
01:28:54,662 --> 01:28:57,331
All l took was a check cut by the city.
That's all l took.

1256
01:28:57,498 --> 01:28:59,958
l didn't take any money.
l didn't take a fucking cent.

1257
01:29:00,126 --> 01:29:03,253
Then what? What did you do?

1258
01:29:05,923 --> 01:29:09,301
-l gotta go. l'm sorry.
-Francis, sit down. Let's talk.

1260
01:29:13,056 --> 01:29:16,850
l gotta do this my way, all right?
l'm sorry.

1261
01:29:33,826 --> 01:29:36,703
Happy New Year!

1262
01:29:51,260 --> 01:29:54,346
Happy fucking New Year!

1263
01:29:55,390 --> 01:29:57,099
Taxi!

1264
01:30:09,737 --> 01:30:11,446
Thanks.

1265
01:30:32,135 --> 01:30:33,176
Fuck!

1266
01:30:33,344 --> 01:30:35,053
Move, l'll break it off.

1267
01:30:35,221 --> 01:30:36,346
Who are you?

1268
01:30:36,514 --> 01:30:39,349
Bragon, Carlos Bragon.
l'm a reporter, for chrissake!

1269
01:30:40,184 --> 01:30:43,019
-You know me, Tierney.
-Shut up, shut up!

1270
01:30:43,187 --> 01:30:45,772
You know me, Tierney. You know me.

1271
01:30:47,483 --> 01:30:49,359
Yeah, l know you, you fucking hack.

1272
01:30:49,527 --> 01:30:52,612
What the fuck are you doing following me?
What do you want?

1273
01:30:53,072 --> 01:30:54,865
l'm writing a story.

1274
01:30:55,032 --> 01:30:57,951
l got two versions,
l wanna run them by you.

1275
01:31:00,079 --> 01:31:03,707
Hero detective captures cop killer.
Kills him in self-defense.

1276
01:31:03,875 --> 01:31:05,500
Yeah, what else?

1277
01:31:05,668 --> 01:31:08,712
The other one is key witness
in a cop-corruption case...

1278
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:12,257
. ..dies mysteriously in the presence
of cops from the 31 st Precinct.

1279
01:31:12,425 --> 01:31:15,218
-Which one sounds better?
-Whatever sells more papers, right?

1280
01:31:15,386 --> 01:31:18,346
Yeah, l know cops from the 31
were there before you, Ray.

1281
01:31:18,514 --> 01:31:20,599
That's your brother's house, isn't it?

1282
01:31:22,894 --> 01:31:27,898
Sources are telling me that Angel Tezo
was tortured and was executed.

1283
01:31:28,065 --> 01:31:31,401
He had half his teeth shoved down
to his belly, splinters in his throat.

1284
01:31:31,569 --> 01:31:34,362
-You carry a stick?
-Keep pushing me, you're gonna find out.

1285
01:31:34,530 --> 01:31:38,200
l'm trying to help you. Be smart.

1286
01:31:38,868 --> 01:31:40,827
l can be writing a story
about Ray Tierney.

1287
01:31:40,995 --> 01:31:43,079
But l should be writing a story
about the 31 .

1288
01:31:46,459 --> 01:31:49,711
You were there. Here's your opportunity
to set it straight right now.

1289
01:31:50,004 --> 01:31:52,255
l don't like my odds with you.

1290
01:31:52,590 --> 01:31:55,091
Last cop you talked to
blew his brains out in your car.

1291
01:31:55,259 --> 01:31:58,386
Last time l saw you, you were
feeding bullshit to the grand jury.

1292
01:31:58,554 --> 01:32:02,015
l was only sitting there
because of your hard-on to crucify cops.

1293
01:32:02,183 --> 01:32:05,268
l do. Because they were protecting
their own and burying the truth.

1294
01:32:05,436 --> 01:32:09,439
Don't talk to me about the truth. You got
no idea what it takes to do what we do.

1295
01:32:09,607 --> 01:32:11,942
-You weren't there.
-You wanna know what l know?

1296
01:32:12,109 --> 01:32:14,528
l know you took a bullet in the face
during the raid.

1297
01:32:14,987 --> 01:32:18,281
l know Kareem Aldovise, a 1 9-year-old
kid, went off that roof and died.

1298
01:32:18,449 --> 01:32:19,491
Everybody knows that.

1299
01:32:19,659 --> 01:32:22,911
Yeah, and l know a witness
saw him surrender before they did it.

1300
01:32:23,621 --> 01:32:26,581
He had no priors, he had no gun.

1301
01:32:27,542 --> 01:32:30,460
You wanna bullshit the grand jury, fine.
Don't do it to me.

1302
01:32:30,628 --> 01:32:34,548
Well, in case you didn't hear, they cleared
us two years ago, okay? Case closed.

1303
01:32:34,715 --> 01:32:38,134
So don't get in my face because you're
skeeved about losing your Pulitzer.

1304
01:32:38,302 --> 01:32:40,428
But you know what?
l don't really think about it that much.

1305
01:32:52,817 --> 01:32:55,777
Wake up, all right? Come on.

1306
01:33:00,616 --> 01:33:02,242
Jimmy!

1307
01:33:02,410 --> 01:33:03,827
Jimmy!

1308
01:33:03,995 --> 01:33:05,287
Help.

1309
01:33:05,454 --> 01:33:07,872
Help me, Jimmy.

1310
01:33:19,010 --> 01:33:20,760
Hey, boss.

1311
01:33:22,346 --> 01:33:23,430
Where is he?

1312
01:34:00,259 --> 01:34:02,802
Have you lost your fucking mind?

1313
01:34:03,262 --> 01:34:07,891
Mayor goes on TV, moans the loss, gives us
a clean bill of health. What's the problem?

1314
01:34:08,059 --> 01:34:11,311
l asked you point-blank, "Were you
involved in this?" What did you say?

1315
01:34:11,479 --> 01:34:13,063
l said what you wanted to hear.

1316
01:34:13,230 --> 01:34:15,690
-l wanted the fucking truth.
-What truth?

1317
01:34:15,858 --> 01:34:20,070
Truth about the money we were getting?
The dirty cops you preside over?

1318
01:34:20,237 --> 01:34:22,739
You knew. All you cared about
was your promotion.

1319
01:34:22,907 --> 01:34:24,741
-l knew what was fucking going on?
-Yeah.

1320
01:34:24,909 --> 01:34:27,911
l gave you room to get the job done.
lf you took a little here.. .

1321
01:34:28,079 --> 01:34:30,246
. .. l wasn't looking.
But you crossed the line.

1322
01:34:30,414 --> 01:34:33,583
What, you think because you didn't
take an envelope, it absolves you?

1323
01:34:33,751 --> 01:34:36,002
Silk hat, same pig.

1324
01:34:36,170 --> 01:34:38,838
Crimes down, collars up.
lt's what you wanted.

1325
01:34:39,006 --> 01:34:41,424
End justifies the means, buddy boy.

1326
01:34:41,592 --> 01:34:44,010
Let me tell you something, Jimmy.

1327
01:34:44,178 --> 01:34:48,723
You think you can set Ray up for this?
You are dead fucking wrong.

1328
01:34:48,891 --> 01:34:52,185
We took you in.
You were a fucking brother to us.

1329
01:34:52,353 --> 01:34:55,855
My sister's your wife, your family's my
family, and you jam us up like this?

1330
01:34:56,023 --> 01:34:59,693
l jam you? l saved you. lt's a lay-up, Fran.

1331
01:34:59,860 --> 01:35:02,195
Oh, yeah? How's that, Jimmy?
Run that by me.

1332
01:35:02,363 --> 01:35:05,281
-Ray sticks to the story, he's a hero.
-That's not gonna happen.

1333
01:35:05,449 --> 01:35:08,159
-You're gonna make this right, or l swear--
-Or what?

1334
01:35:08,327 --> 01:35:10,787
What the fuck are you gonna do, Franny?

1335
01:35:10,955 --> 01:35:14,749
You gonna burn down your own house?
Blow up everything you worked for?

1336
01:35:15,584 --> 01:35:17,335
All Ray's gotta do is walk into lAB...

1337
01:35:17,503 --> 01:35:20,880
. ..say what needs to be said,
end of fucking story.

1338
01:35:21,048 --> 01:35:24,384
-We go home, we go to sleep at night.
-You think this ends that simply?

1339
01:35:24,552 --> 01:35:28,471
We all go to sleep at night. Let me tell you,
what we've done does not get forgiven.

1340
01:35:28,639 --> 01:35:31,099
Here we go with the
Sister Mary Margarets.

1341
01:35:31,267 --> 01:35:32,976
Someone says you're dirty, who cares?

1342
01:35:33,144 --> 01:35:35,353
They say you're fucking corrupt.
Fuck them.

1343
01:35:35,521 --> 01:35:37,522
Do they know how these animals live?

1344
01:35:37,690 --> 01:35:40,150
We tour the sewers, Franny!

1345
01:35:40,317 --> 01:35:43,361
l will not apologize for doing what l do.
l earn 65 grand a year.

1346
01:35:43,529 --> 01:35:47,490
Some fuck like Tezo wipes his ass
with that shit in a week.

1347
01:35:49,118 --> 01:35:51,327
We're in this together, Franny.

1348
01:35:52,163 --> 01:35:55,540
-What the fuck is that?
-lt's your cut. l've been keeping it for you.

1349
01:35:56,000 --> 01:36:02,005
Take the fucking money, Franny.

1350
01:36:03,090 --> 01:36:05,258
You were my brother, Jimmy.

1351
01:36:05,676 --> 01:36:08,178
Franny. Take--

1352
01:36:22,276 --> 01:36:23,443
Fuck.

1353
01:36:43,339 --> 01:36:45,298
Yeah, Tierney.

1354
01:36:48,511 --> 01:36:51,137
Whoa, whoa, whoa. lAB?

1355
01:36:55,392 --> 01:36:58,394
Well, no, no,
but l thought l'd have some time.

1356
01:37:00,564 --> 01:37:02,774
Detective, let me start
by saying we're aware...

1357
01:37:02,942 --> 01:37:05,693
...of your outstanding service record...

1358
01:37:05,861 --> 01:37:08,738
...and we wanna thank you
for your role in solving this case.

1359
01:37:08,906 --> 01:37:12,116
We're gonna make this as brief as possible,
gonna get you out of here.

1360
01:37:12,284 --> 01:37:16,454
We need a statement detailing
your participation in the incident on record.

1361
01:37:16,622 --> 01:37:20,166
Now, you declined to give a
statement at the scene of the shooting.

1362
01:37:20,334 --> 01:37:22,585
-ls that correct?
That's right.

1363
01:37:22,753 --> 01:37:26,881
Mr. Tezo was tried and sentenced
in a bathroom in the Bronx.

1364
01:37:27,341 --> 01:37:29,259
But you're prepared to give us one now?

1365
01:37:29,426 --> 01:37:30,760
Far removed from a jury.

1366
01:37:30,928 --> 01:37:33,221
-Far removed from a judge.
l'm gonna do my best.

1367
01:37:33,389 --> 01:37:35,306
Far removed
from our basic rights...

1368
01:37:35,474 --> 01:37:37,600
...endowed on all men
by our Constitution.

1369
01:37:38,060 --> 01:37:39,602
This march will commence at noon.

1370
01:37:39,770 --> 01:37:40,812
Can you explain...

1371
01:37:40,980 --> 01:37:43,147
...how your investigation
led to the apprehension of Tezo?

1372
01:37:43,315 --> 01:37:45,733
--and end up on the steps
of the 31 st Precinct.

1373
01:37:45,901 --> 01:37:49,445
Angel Tezo was identified by
witnesses at the scene of the shooting.

1374
01:37:49,613 --> 01:37:52,115
l sought information
regarding his whereabouts...

1375
01:37:52,283 --> 01:37:54,534
...from a former confidential informant.

1376
01:37:54,702 --> 01:37:57,912
He directed me to the location in question
in Morrisania...

1377
01:37:58,080 --> 01:37:59,747
...and l followed that lead.

1378
01:37:59,915 --> 01:38:04,210
The reverend reiterated
that this planned march is about peace. . .

1379
01:38:04,378 --> 01:38:09,924
...and is not intended as a condemnation
of the entire N.Y.P.D.

1380
01:38:10,092 --> 01:38:12,635
the 31 st Precinct...

1381
01:38:12,803 --> 01:38:16,514
. ..and the officers involved in the
Angel Tezo killing.

1382
01:38:16,682 --> 01:38:18,474
The investigation is continuing.

1383
01:38:18,642 --> 01:38:22,103
-Now, did you pursue this lead alone?
-No.

1384
01:38:22,438 --> 01:38:25,481
l called the task force.
l spoke to my colleague, Detective Miller.

1385
01:38:25,649 --> 01:38:29,527
l told him where l was going.
l requested backup, and he initiated that.

1386
01:38:29,695 --> 01:38:31,905
But you arrived on the location alone.

1387
01:38:32,072 --> 01:38:34,616
l arrived before the rest of the team, yes.

1388
01:38:35,826 --> 01:38:37,493
Okay.

1389
01:38:39,788 --> 01:38:44,083
Now, could you describe for us what
transpired at the location in question. . .

1390
01:38:44,251 --> 01:38:47,503
. ..leading up to you having to
discharge your weapon?

1391
01:38:57,514 --> 01:38:58,848
Detective?

1392
01:39:14,698 --> 01:39:17,116
This isn't gonna go how you want it to.

1393
01:39:18,327 --> 01:39:19,535
Excuse me?

1394
01:39:24,124 --> 01:39:26,834
l know what you guys want me to say.. .

1395
01:39:27,336 --> 01:39:28,711
. ..but it's not gonna happen.

1396
01:39:28,879 --> 01:39:32,548
No one's looking for you to say anything
except your version of what happened.

1397
01:39:32,716 --> 01:39:34,926
-Really?
-All we need is a full accounting.. .

1398
01:39:35,094 --> 01:39:36,970
. ..of what happened,
then we can go home.

1399
01:39:37,137 --> 01:39:39,180
Yeah, l know what you need.

1400
01:39:39,974 --> 01:39:43,434
But l can't give it to you,
because l didn't shoot him.

1401
01:39:43,602 --> 01:39:47,063
Are you aware that ballistics
has confirmed that the perp was killed.. .

1402
01:39:47,231 --> 01:39:50,066
...by three bullets fired from your gun
at close range?

1403
01:39:50,234 --> 01:39:51,442
l am.

1404
01:39:51,610 --> 01:39:53,569
But you maintain
that you didn't shoot him?

1405
01:39:53,737 --> 01:39:55,238
l do.

1406
01:39:55,406 --> 01:39:57,907
- Could you elaborate on that?
- No, l would not care to.

1407
01:39:58,075 --> 01:40:00,201
What are you saying, detective?

1408
01:40:00,369 --> 01:40:02,787
From here on out, nothing.

1409
01:40:02,955 --> 01:40:06,082
l respectfully refuse
to answer any further questions.

1410
01:40:06,250 --> 01:40:09,293
Are you denying that you
were involved in the Angel Tezo killing?

1411
01:40:09,461 --> 01:40:14,048
l respectfully refuse
to answer any more questions.

1412
01:40:14,216 --> 01:40:16,592
lf you don't start answering,
this is gonna go bad.

1413
01:40:16,760 --> 01:40:18,261
We can do this all afternoon...

1414
01:40:18,429 --> 01:40:22,098
...but l have nothing more to say
in this matter.

1415
01:40:23,517 --> 01:40:27,103
This wasn't like Ray. He's not that guy.

1416
01:40:27,271 --> 01:40:29,522
He's a fucking good cop.

1417
01:40:30,566 --> 01:40:32,483
He's a good man.

1418
01:40:33,152 --> 01:40:35,987
He said something about Lonnie Mercer,
"Lonnie and l."

1419
01:40:36,155 --> 01:40:39,824
l remember that they were close.
They were partners.

1420
01:40:39,992 --> 01:40:41,743
Lonnie Mercer...

1421
01:40:41,910 --> 01:40:43,828
...one of the officers killed
in the Washington Heights raid?

1422
01:40:43,996 --> 01:40:45,038
That's right.

1423
01:40:45,205 --> 01:40:47,123
What happened next?

1424
01:40:47,583 --> 01:40:49,292
l tried to revive Mr. Tezo.

1425
01:40:49,460 --> 01:40:52,170
l didn't know if he'd had a heart attack...

1426
01:40:52,337 --> 01:40:54,672
...or if he was still alive.
l tried to revive him.

1427
01:40:54,840 --> 01:40:57,717
l checked for a pulse,
l couldn't find a fucking pulse.

1428
01:40:57,885 --> 01:40:59,302
He looked pretty fucking dead.

1429
01:41:00,471 --> 01:41:03,639
So l did some fucking CPR.

1430
01:41:03,807 --> 01:41:08,895
After l tried to revive him,
l was still kneeling over the body.

1431
01:41:11,815 --> 01:41:14,108
That's when the shots went off.

1432
01:41:18,906 --> 01:41:20,656
Oh, fuck.

1433
01:41:20,824 --> 01:41:22,533
Who was shot?

1434
01:41:22,701 --> 01:41:25,828
-Mr. Tezo was shot?
Yeah.

1435
01:41:25,996 --> 01:41:28,831
Yeah, he was shot. Yeah, he was shot.

1436
01:41:28,999 --> 01:41:32,293
Got what he fucking deserved.
Got what he fucking deserved.

1437
01:41:32,836 --> 01:41:34,962
Who shot Mr. Tezo?

1438
01:41:38,383 --> 01:41:41,052
l would've done the same thing myself.

1439
01:41:41,220 --> 01:41:44,514
Who shot Angel Tezo, Sergeant Egan?

1440
01:41:50,312 --> 01:41:52,355
Detective Tierney.

1441
01:41:53,941 --> 01:41:56,442
Detective Raymond Tierney?

1442
01:42:02,366 --> 01:42:03,741
Yes.

1443
01:42:14,378 --> 01:42:16,129
Listen, Frank...

1444
01:42:16,296 --> 01:42:21,801
. .. l know how this must feel,
and l wish l knew what to say.

1445
01:42:22,886 --> 01:42:27,723
But you should know that these officers
are all prepared to testify at a grand jury.

1446
01:42:28,559 --> 01:42:31,394
So what's critical now,
from here on out...

1447
01:42:31,562 --> 01:42:35,606
. ..is that we handle this thing quietly,
with as little incident as possible.

1448
01:42:35,774 --> 01:42:38,234
He's not capable of that.

1449
01:42:38,861 --> 01:42:40,736
l know my son. He's not capable of that.

1450
01:42:40,904 --> 01:42:44,198
Frank, we're gonna have to bring Ray in.

1451
01:42:51,957 --> 01:42:53,541
You okay?

1452
01:42:54,168 --> 01:42:55,835
Hey.

1453
01:43:01,091 --> 01:43:03,009
l'm proud of you.

1454
01:43:04,761 --> 01:43:06,846
Call me when it's done.

1455
01:43:07,723 --> 01:43:11,726
They wanna take you in,
put "arrest pending" in the press tomorrow.

1456
01:43:11,894 --> 01:43:14,729
l'm sitting there on my ass,
watching this fucking testimony.

1457
01:43:14,897 --> 01:43:16,939
You believe that shit
that Jimmy's spinning?

1458
01:43:17,107 --> 01:43:21,194
-You gonna tell me you believe that?
-Of course not. That's not the point.

1459
01:43:21,361 --> 01:43:24,906
l told you to run everything through me
and that we would handle it.

1460
01:43:25,073 --> 01:43:28,242
And then you sit down
with the goddamn lAB. . .

1461
01:43:28,410 --> 01:43:29,785
. ..and don't give me a heads up?

1462
01:43:29,953 --> 01:43:32,246
No fucking phone call?
You don't talk to me, Ray.

1463
01:43:32,414 --> 01:43:34,373
l'm here. l'm telling you now, okay?

1464
01:43:34,541 --> 01:43:37,752
Listen to me. Jimmy is a drug dealer, Pop.

1465
01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:41,255
He murdered that guy, and Fran is in it.
Pop, he's in up to his neck.

1466
01:43:41,423 --> 01:43:45,593
Now, l tried. l tried to talk to Fran,
and when l sat in there with those guys...

1467
01:43:45,761 --> 01:43:49,472
. .. l gave them nothing.
l said as little as l could say.

1468
01:43:49,640 --> 01:43:54,602
But if Jimmy's gonna box me in, l gotta tell
them what l know. l got no fucking choice.

1469
01:43:54,770 --> 01:43:56,896
The fuck you got no choice.

1470
01:43:57,064 --> 01:43:59,732
You could've taken that lay-up
that they were handing you.

1471
01:43:59,900 --> 01:44:02,693
-Oh, no. No, Pop.
-And saved us a fucking mess.

1472
01:44:02,861 --> 01:44:04,654
Come on. What good would it have done?

1473
01:44:04,821 --> 01:44:08,658
Jimmy's a scumbag. Jesus.
We'll take care of him.

1474
01:44:08,825 --> 01:44:12,870
But we got a hole that needs
to get plugged up...

1475
01:44:13,038 --> 01:44:15,289
. ..before it takes down
half the department.

1476
01:44:15,958 --> 01:44:17,250
lt's too late, Pop.

1477
01:44:18,126 --> 01:44:20,461
We protect our own, Ray.

1478
01:44:20,629 --> 01:44:24,298
That is all l know. We protect our own.
You gotta show me some fucking loyalty.

1479
01:44:24,466 --> 01:44:29,011
No. Don't use that word with me. lt doesn't
mean shit to me anymore, you know that?

1480
01:44:29,179 --> 01:44:31,097
l done your loyalty. lt cost me too much.

1481
01:44:31,265 --> 01:44:34,433
-What did it cost you?
-lt cost me everything!

1482
01:44:35,018 --> 01:44:37,645
lt cost me the woman that l love.

1483
01:44:39,231 --> 01:44:41,983
Because she told me that we were wrong
on Mott Haven.

1484
01:44:42,150 --> 01:44:43,526
She told me. l didn't listen.

1485
01:44:43,694 --> 01:44:46,612
Look, you said you weren't sure about
what you saw. l heard it.

1486
01:44:46,780 --> 01:44:49,490
You heard what you wanted to hear.
Don't bullshit me.

1487
01:44:49,658 --> 01:44:52,994
lt was a lie to protect a bad cop,
and you knew it, and l knew it.

1488
01:44:53,161 --> 01:44:55,871
And l got up there and said it
in front of the grand jury.

1489
01:44:56,039 --> 01:44:57,707
-l got it.
-l'm not gonna do this.

1490
01:44:57,874 --> 01:44:59,750
-Not for you.
-l'm responsible, huh?

1491
01:44:59,918 --> 01:45:04,130
-This is my responsibility, this shit?
-No. We did wrong. l wanna hear you say it.

1492
01:45:04,298 --> 01:45:05,715
Both of you, stop the yelling.

1493
01:45:05,882 --> 01:45:08,009
-Get out of here, Mo.
-No. Stop it.

1494
01:45:08,176 --> 01:45:09,885
-Get out of here.
l am not leaving.

1495
01:45:10,053 --> 01:45:11,554
-This is not for you.
-No, no.

1496
01:45:11,722 --> 01:45:13,973
-l am not leaving.
-l don't want you hearing this.

1497
01:45:14,141 --> 01:45:15,683
Hey, hey, hey. Dad, take it easy.

1498
01:45:15,851 --> 01:45:18,561
-Don't yell at her.
Get upstairs.

1499
01:45:19,604 --> 01:45:20,813
This is too much.

1500
01:45:39,416 --> 01:45:42,585
Now, you listen to me,
and you listen good.

1501
01:45:42,753 --> 01:45:44,837
This is not just about the department.

1502
01:45:45,005 --> 01:45:47,590
That's not what we're talking about here.

1503
01:45:47,758 --> 01:45:50,426
This is family. This is our way of life.

1504
01:45:50,594 --> 01:45:52,053
Jimmy is married to your sister.

1505
01:45:52,220 --> 01:45:56,015
He's the father of her children,
for chrissake.

1506
01:45:56,183 --> 01:46:00,519
And your brother is in a bad hour here,
and the only way through this is you.

1507
01:46:00,687 --> 01:46:02,938
You're the only door.

1508
01:46:03,607 --> 01:46:07,401
Jimmy is gonna take back his story.
l'll see to that.

1509
01:46:07,569 --> 01:46:10,654
And you just follow the crumbs
like they're laid out for you.

1510
01:46:10,822 --> 01:46:13,115
Take a deep breath
and say what needs to be said.

1511
01:46:13,283 --> 01:46:17,787
Like you believe it with every bone of your
body, and then we move through this thing.

1512
01:46:17,954 --> 01:46:21,123
-And that's what you're gonna do.
-No.

1513
01:46:21,833 --> 01:46:24,293
No, he's not gonna do that, Pop.

1514
01:46:26,505 --> 01:46:30,674
-Franny, listen.
-Ray is not getting hung out for what l did.

1515
01:46:30,842 --> 01:46:32,051
What l did.

1516
01:46:32,719 --> 01:46:34,720
He'll get a slap on the wrist,
nothing more.

1517
01:46:34,888 --> 01:46:37,765
-You're not thinking clearly, Franny.
-Yeah, l am.

1518
01:46:37,933 --> 01:46:43,312
Listen to me, Pop. This shit ends now.

1519
01:46:43,480 --> 01:46:45,314
Tonight.

1520
01:46:47,442 --> 01:46:50,778
And if that means
l can't be a cop anymore...

1521
01:46:51,822 --> 01:46:53,489
. .. l'm okay with that.

1522
01:47:10,966 --> 01:47:12,383
What do you want me to do?

1523
01:47:13,844 --> 01:47:17,346
We're gonna get Jimmy.
That's what we're gonna do.

1524
01:47:18,348 --> 01:47:20,516
Yeah. Okay.

1525
01:47:36,491 --> 01:47:38,909
Just gonna make a stop over here.

1526
01:47:39,286 --> 01:47:41,078
Real quick.

1527
01:47:42,789 --> 01:47:44,582
What are you doing?

1528
01:47:44,916 --> 01:47:46,459
l gotta pick something up.

1529
01:47:46,626 --> 01:47:49,086
Picking up what?
Whoa, whoa, what the fuck is that?

1530
01:47:49,254 --> 01:47:52,465
-l gotta make a collection.
-A collection with a gun? Jesus, come on.

1531
01:47:52,632 --> 01:47:55,050
Jimmy told us to lay low.
Stay under the radar.

1532
01:47:55,218 --> 01:47:58,554
-You know what? Fuck Jimmy.
-Fuck Jimmy? What are you talking about?

1533
01:47:58,722 --> 01:48:01,515
-Jimmy's looking out for us.
-Jimmy ain't looking out for me!

1534
01:48:01,683 --> 01:48:06,353
He ain't paying my fucking rent! l got no
fucking money in my pocket. l'm broke!

1535
01:48:06,521 --> 01:48:09,315
-Jeez, you coming with me or not?
-No, l'm not coming, Eddie.

1536
01:48:09,483 --> 01:48:12,485
-Do what you wanna do. Stay here.
-l will fucking stay here.

1537
01:48:18,700 --> 01:48:20,409
Yo, bro.

1538
01:48:37,928 --> 01:48:41,305
No, l'm not a fucking cop anymore.
Get the fuck out of here.

1539
01:48:44,184 --> 01:48:46,393
You gotta do this every time?

1540
01:48:47,854 --> 01:48:50,606
Let's fucking go, Eddie. Let's go.

1541
01:48:53,068 --> 01:48:54,610
-Shit, Eddie!
Get down. get down.

1542
01:48:54,778 --> 01:48:57,279
Eddie, fucking-- Eddie.

1543

Out of the store. l'm a cop. Out of the

Yo, that's that nigga right there.

Wait, man, slow down.

1571
01:50:44,137 --> 01:50:46,805
Looks like it's two guys from

Chief Tierney,

Have a warrant for your son's arrest.
We'd like him to come with us.

1582
01:51:32,268 --> 01:51:34,353

-How about if l come in myself and tell him?
-No, you're not invited.

1586
01:51:42,946 --> 01:51:46,448
Now, get the hell off my porch
and take your boys with you.

1587
01:51:47,617 --> 01:51:49,034
Let's go.

1588

Let's go.

We'll meet back here.

1592

01:53:56,538 --> 01:54:00,249
You do not want that to happen. You do not
want me to lose control of this scene.

1618
01:54:00,416 --> 01:54:02,960
Do not fucking play me, Franny.

1619
01:54:03,127 --> 01:54:06,755
There's no play here, Kenny.
There's no fucking play.

01:54:12,679 --> 01:54:13,720
Kenny.

You got anything you wanna say to me
about what you've done?

You left me no choice, Ray.

Push to shove, it's me and mine.
lt's Megan and the kids.

1628
01:55:28,379 --> 01:55:30,881
After that, it's every swinging dick
for himself.

1629
01:55:31,132 --> 01:55:33,800
You broke our fucking hearts, Jimmy.

1630
01:55:36,512 --> 01:55:38,847
Lot of hearts broken, Ray.

1631
01:55:41,100 --> 01:55:42,809
There's a lot of hearts broken.

01:55:51,194 --> 01:55:53,403
So how do you think this ends?

You gonna take me in?

1634
01:55:59,702 --> 01:56:02,037
Take your gun out and put it on the bar.

1635
01:57:27,957 --> 01:57:29,958
Turn on me, Ray!

1636
