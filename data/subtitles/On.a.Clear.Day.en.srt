{786}{854}MAN: This is a poem, that was...
{897}{962}Um, I found it in the Iibrary.
{973}{1022}(CIears throat) It's for my son.
{1075}{1115}To A Child Dancing In The Wind.
{1179}{1228}"Dance there upon the shore
{1253}{1295}What need have you to care
{1297}{1341}For wind or waters roar?
{1343}{1381}Tumble out your hair
{1404}{1452}That the salt drops have wet
{1497}{1543}What need have you to dread
{1545}{1591}The monstrous crying of the wind? "
{1714}{1770}(Laughter)
{2279}{2328}(Gulls cry)
{2355}{2404}(Waves lap the shore)
{2633}{2695}Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.
{3203}{3236}Excuse me.
{3273}{3291}James.
{3293}{3323}James?
{3325}{3368}James! James! Come here.
{3405}{3455}Stay close, OK?
{3457}{3517}Give me your hand, tight. Hold it tight.
{3776}{3825}Sorry. Sorry.
{3876}{3916}- Sorry.|- Where are they?
{4224}{4292}Listen, Frank,|You look after yourself, all right?
{4294}{4353}Angela, this way.
{4355}{4392}Sorry. Excuse me.
{4431}{4493}(Cheering and whistling)|- There she goes, boys.
{4656}{4713}Look at that. Isn't that fantastic?
{4846}{4913}- Rob!|- Mum, there you are.
{4915}{4979}Hello. I thought I was going to miss it.
{5036}{5097}- Where's Grandpa?|- I don't know.
{5253}{5310}Pappy won't be coming. He's not here.
{5741}{5780}Come on, Frank.
{5919}{5981}You're missing it, Frank.
{6159}{6226}- You coming out?|- I'll be out in a minute, Danny.
{6552}{6630}How can they let someone else|build our navy's ships?
{6632}{6681}It's just the way it is.
{6683}{6732}And you...
{6734}{6786}How can they let you go?
{6842}{6906}- You want this?|- No, thanks.
{7444}{7480}All right, Gus?
{7482}{7526}(Whirring of machinery)
{7557}{7640}(Siren)|- You all right?
{8210}{8275}- Joan Redmond?|- Yeah, I'm sorry.
{8277}{8335}Excuse me. I'm sorry.
{8360}{8414}Excuse me. I'm sorry.
{8522}{8551}- Sorry.|- Right...
{8553}{8647}As I was saying, driving a bus|is exactly the same as driving a car,
{8649}{8743}except for the 50 or so back-seat drivers|sitting behind you.
{8940}{8989}(Door opens)
{9218}{9267}Rob brought the boys for your last day.
{9363}{9412}They were looking for you.
{9414}{9494}Gus Fuller lost his hand today.
{9496}{9530}Oh!
{9565}{9589}How?
{9591}{9669}- One of the presses.|- (Gasps)
{9809}{9844}Will he get more money?
{9895}{9944}I watched him do it.
{11183}{11232}That's you tidy.
{11414}{11463}See you soon, love.
{12027}{12064}- Hello.|- Hi.
{12066}{12171}- JSA, pensions or disability?|- I'm looking for a job.
{12173}{12212}First time?
{12214}{12289}- Yeah.|- You'll need to speak to someone.
{12314}{12348}Let's see who's free.
{12725}{12768}Angela.
{12770}{12844}- All right?|- OK.
{13409}{13482}Look, Frank, you don't have to fill it in here.
{13500}{13545}You can do it at home.
{13901}{13940}(Breathes rapidly)
{14151}{14200}(Panting)
{14539}{14637}- Won't be the same at work without Frank.|- You got the boot as well, you dozy pillock!
{14639}{14714}He might have a heart attack.|That happens, doesn't it?
{14716}{14766}Work, Monday.|Redundant, Tuesday.
{14768}{14820}Heart attack, Wednesday.
{14822}{14895}Frank will be all right, then. Today's Thursday.
{14915}{15001}What in the name of total insanity|are you wearing?
{15003}{15099}- Och, I had nae clean ones.|- Tell me they're not your mother's.
{15118}{15166}Don't be daft. They're big Janine's.
{15168}{15256}- She left them in the pub on Friday.|- Don't let Frank catch you wearing them.
{15258}{15328}- I knew they'd come in handy.|- For what exactly?
{15330}{15377}What if I get run over?
{15436}{15554}Frank won't be coming swimming tonight.|I'm glad I got out when I did. It's turned nasty.
{15556}{15620}Frank could have stayed like I did.|The men respect him.
{15622}{15716}All he had to do was let them upstairs think|they were running the job.
{15718}{15770}Man's too pig-headed for his own good.
{15961}{16032}- Frank, I didn't mean...|- Leave it, Eddie.
{16224}{16261}See you in the pool, then.
{17511}{17535}Frank?
{17638}{17691}Frank?
{17729}{17768}- Frank?|JOAN: Excuse me.
{17770}{17811}Frank?
{17834}{17892}Frank, where are you going?
{17914}{17966}EDDlE: Frank!|JOAN: Oh, my God!
{17968}{17993}Frank!
{17995}{18062}Hey, man. Hey!
{18064}{18103}Get an ambulance, Joan!
{18105}{18152}Please, no.
{18154}{18192}You're all right, man.
{18194}{18243}Get out of my way!
{18388}{18442}It's OK. He's OK. Dad's fine.
{18461}{18525}It was a panic attack.|That's what the doctor said.
{18527}{18562}- What?|- A panic attack.
{18564}{18625}Only, don't mention it when he comes out.
{18627}{18676}OK, let's go.
{18678}{18730}- Eddie rang me.|- Eddie's got a big mouth.
{18732}{18786}- He was worried.|- I slipped, OK?
{18788}{18863}- Can I get money for a can of Coke?|- You collapsed.
{18865}{18942}- Mum says you had a panic attack.|- I slipped and fell. It happens.
{18944}{19021}- What are you asking me for?|- Have you got money for a can of Coke?
{19023}{19068}No, I don't. Have you got your purse?
{19070}{19132}- No, I don't have my purse.|- Ask your dad for the money.
{19134}{19178}- How do I get out of here?|- Down there.
{19180}{19220}- Right, left?|- That way, Frank.
{19222}{19301}- Right, I'll find it.|- I'm really sorry, love.
{19330}{19383}Come on, boys, let's go.
{19410}{19475}- What is the matter with you?|- You shouldn't...
{19477}{19558}- You could have said hello.|- You should not have told him.
{19706}{19727}(Bell)
{19729}{19799}- Hands.|(Lift door shuts)
{20021}{20098}- Is Pappy all right?|- Of course he is.
{20249}{20300}Do you like Pappy?
{20302}{20356}Pappy and I are just different.
{20393}{20434}Pappy doesn't like you.
{20750}{20806}Oh, look who it is. Frank's little girl.
{20808}{20852}(Sniggering)
{20891}{20971}Are ourfish suppers ready yet, Chinaman?
{20973}{21076}Oh, God love us.|He's a real chatterbox tonight, isn't he?
{21078}{21109}(Chuckling)
{21137}{21182}Tell you what. I've changed my mind.
{21184}{21233}I fancy a curry.
{21468}{21513}See you Tuesday.
{21714}{21763}Just a bag of chips, please, Chan.
{21814}{21900}I heard about your Dad. I'm er...sorry.
{22152}{22201}OK, Chan?
{22219}{22260}Frank, all right?
{22287}{22323}Good book?
{22350}{22425}It's for my wife. It's about cooking.
{22484}{22533}What are you looking for?
{22590}{22639}I don't know.
{22680}{22730}But whatever it is, it's not in here.
{22941}{23007}JOAN: He doesn't know|what to do with himself any more.
{23009}{23075}More than I can say for you, driving a bus.|Have you told him?
{23077}{23152}No. Don't want to give him|anything else to worry about.
{23154}{23218}He's going to find out sooner or later.
{23220}{23297}He's shut me out again, Michelle.|Like when Stuart...
{23299}{23382}It won't last long.|Are things better with him and Rob?
{23384}{23416}Not really.
{23680}{23718}- Good evening.|- Hiya.
{23720}{23759}- Bag of chips, please.|- OK.
{23884}{23955}- Is your Dad around?|- No.
{23974}{24023}Salt and vinegar?
{24043}{24072}Please.
{24445}{24494}(Laughter on TV)
{24512}{24602}Oh, hi, Frank. Come on in.|I'm just off to work.
{24624}{24669}Tom Cruise is in the front room.
{24671}{24757}Eddie, it's Frank. He's got chips.
{24925}{25056}TV:..but our industrious Iittle beetle is about|to meet someone altogether more scary...
{25058}{25107}I've seen this before.
{25138}{25297}That wee beetle pushes that big ball of shite|for what is the equivalent of six miles for him.
{25299}{25355}Then just as he gets to where he's going,
{25385}{25443}another beetle comes...
{25445}{25496}and steals it from under his nose.
{25498}{25560}It's what happens. Wait, you'll see.
{25562}{25616}Six miles.
{25618}{25667}Poor bastard.
{25669}{25736}They'll have you shovelling shit, you know that?
{25797}{25846}I know.
{25922}{25990}You still coming on the booze cruise to France?
{25992}{26037}It will do us good.
{26039}{26088}I can see myself on the ship now.
{26115}{26197}Captain Eddie Fraser, beer in my hand
{26218}{26278}and the sea air in my lungs.
{26280}{26318}DANNY: Oh, Eddie!
{26320}{26375}That seagull's eating your puke.
{26420}{26510}He caught it in the air.|That seagull caught it in the air.
{26512}{26589}Puke again, Eddie. Go on, puke again.
{26706}{26747}That's brilliant that.
{27143}{27192}All right?
{27225}{27263}Bloody hell.
{27265}{27360}You can see France already.|Isn't very far, is it?
{27362}{27407}Near enough to swim.
{27409}{27464}I wish I had.
{27814}{27843}(Laughter)
{28123}{28161}EDDlE: Frank?
{28197}{28250}Frank?
{28252}{28301}You all right?
{28393}{28451}How mad would you have to be to swim this?
{28470}{28506}Totally.
{28702}{28786}DANNY: How far is it to France?|EDDlE: We're in France, you dipstick.
{28805}{28878}DANNY: I know we're in France|but how far is it from Britain?
{28880}{28970}NORMAN: 20 miles,|give or take the odd oil tanker.
{28972}{29025}DANNY: 20 miles, eh?|How do they measure that?
{29027}{29088}MlCHELLE: They look very small from here.
{29090}{29182}They are very small. It's just|us women like to shrink when we get near them.
{29184}{29291}You can't just swim across|one of the busiest shipping routes in the world.
{29293}{29366}Who do you show your passport to?|Punch and Judy?
{29368}{29458}- The deckchair man.|- I was a deckchair man for a day.
{29460}{29539}- Only a day?|- It wasn't what I was expecting.
{29569}{29663}MlCHELLE: Did you tell him yet?|JOAN: No. God, no.
{29665}{29714}I will.
{29716}{29799}He won't like it.|He'll think it's to do with him losing his job.
{29801}{29898}MlCHELLE: And he'll like it even less|when he finds out the truth.
{29900}{29968}That it's got absolutely nothing|to do with him at all.
{30395}{30496}Sorry to pull you back to the yard like this,|Frank. It's a small little matter.
{30498}{30588}I just need to prove something.|I know you must be busy.
{30622}{30671}So, you know these guys, Frank?
{30705}{30795}- So...|- I've told you...I didn't see anything.
{30843}{30919}He must have been desperate.|He's going to get nothing.
{30947}{30996}He used the wrong hand.
{31053}{31097}He's right-handed.
{31124}{31140}Duncan.
{31212}{31262}He crossed hands...
{31264}{31303}to operate the press.
{31396}{31420}OK.
{31518}{31597}You should have been more loyal|to the company, Frank.
{31618}{31660}You wouldn't know what loyalty is.
{31681}{31740}Loyalty is a full wage packet|at the end of the week.
{31772}{31821}Loyalty is being valued.
{31847}{31903}Being happy with yourself.
{31927}{31986}Are you happy with yourself, Frank?
{32040}{32089}Who do you think you are?
{32127}{32218}You seriously think you can intimidate people|into being loyal to you?
{32268}{32356}There's not a man in this yard|would piss on you if you were on fire.
{32546}{32583}Hi, Frank.
{32585}{32629}Cannae keep away, eh?
{34292}{34357}- I knocked a vase over.|- Which one?
{34359}{34439}- The one with the crack in it?|- No, the other one.
{34498}{34547}Will it fix?
{34679}{34728}I need to go and get changed.
{34730}{34779}(Squelches)
{34889}{34960}So what if you swam the CIyde?|It doesn't prove anything.
{34962}{35019}The Channel's a completely different thing.
{35021}{35085}- Do you think you could, then, Frank?|- I know I could.
{35086}{35163}EDDlE: Look...you got made redundant.
{35165}{35231}You should just face up to it like everyone else.
{35589}{35638}Face up to it?
{35761}{35810}Like you did, Eddie?
{36308}{36377}- That's a lot of reading.|- It's a lot of swimming.
{36395}{36492}- You think I'm wasting my time?|- A gem cannot be polished without friction,
{36494}{36550}nor a man perfected without trials.
{36614}{36714}- Is that a yes or a no?|- When do we start?
{37198}{37266}Hey, hey, hey.|What have we forgotten?
{37384}{37433}What's this?
{37457}{37521}You know we're not allowed. In you go.
{37550}{37589}I'll see you at 3:30.
{37591}{37636}- Bye!|- Bye!
{37951}{37990}- All right, son.|- Dad.
{38022}{38052}OK?
{38099}{38133}You?
{38135}{38186}Yeah, good.
{38188}{38226}Busy?
{38228}{38263}Aye.
{38359}{38411}You used to have one of them. Remember?
{38435}{38464}Yeah.
{38509}{38573}They had one each|but they're always losing them.
{38608}{38673}I was going to go for a coffee. Want to come?
{38691}{38747}I'd better not. Got to get on.
{38782}{38824}Maybe next time.
{38855}{38879}Aye.
{39357}{39414}I promised Michelle I'd fix this for her.
{39416}{39474}I just wanted to see what was inside.
{39476}{39532}Now it doesn't seem to want to go back together.
{39534}{39615}Things aren't meant to be fixed nowadays.
{39637}{39674}No.
{39676}{39736}Not by you, anyway.
{39890}{39914}How's work?
{40043}{40122}What was it Sausage Finger said today?|Something funny.
{40234}{40309}No, I can't remember.|It was funny anyway, whatever it was.
{40331}{40395}The thing that he said. It was funny.
{40457}{40506}I'm going to swim it, Ed.
{40596}{40635}I know you are.
{41155}{41232}- Oh, my, that's a lot of reading.|- It's a lot of swimming.
{41234}{41302}Probably mentions sharks.|Does it mention sharks, Frank?
{41304}{41371}EDDlE: There's no sharks in the Channel.|- This one shark,
{41373}{41439}they opened it up|and found a telly and a box of condoms.
{41441}{41505}- They did not.|- And don't tell me the telly was still on?
{41506}{41617}Look, it's important they take this seriously|or you may as well not bother.
{41619}{41683}- Bloody hell.|- Bugger me.
{41685}{41759}Are you coming or are you going?
{41761}{41815}- Sorry, Frank.|- Sorry, Frank.
{41862}{41949}- There is the training schedule.|- I don't mean to be rude, Chan...
{41951}{42042}- Things to do to set the swim up.|-..but I didn't think you could speak English.
{42044}{42115}- I didn't think you could speak.|- Danny...
{42117}{42166}First, we need to register the swim.
{42168}{42257}I've only heard you say three words|and two of them were "salt" and "vinegar".
{42259}{42301}Will you let the man speak?
{42334}{42369}Sorry, Chan.
{42371}{42442}Next, we have to get a boat|and an experienced pilot.
{42444}{42509}How about Merv? He's got a boat.
{42511}{42564}Merv the Perv has got a boat?
{42566}{42624}A daft pointy one,|all chrome and shiny plastic.
{42626}{42697}- I don't want to talk to Merv.|NORMAN: It's got a dinky wee bar.
{42699}{42763}- Does it go fast, though?|- Like shit off a stick.
{43152}{43204}EDDlE: Two years, that's what it takes.
{43206}{43255}I want to do it in six months.
{43286}{43335}Would you have time to help me?
{43337}{43374}Aye.
{43452}{43527}Ed, I would have asked you|but I didn't think you would have time.
{43529}{43654}Aye, well, Chan is probably better|at this sort of thing than me, anyway.
{43773}{43864}Look, guys, do me a favour|and can we just keep this to ourselves?
{43889}{43923}- Sure.|- Aye.
{43980}{44044}- Is he in?|- Aye, he's in the kitchen.
{44045}{44069}Right.
{44071}{44120}(Doorbell)
{44224}{44273}- Good evening, Joan.|- Hello, Norman.
{44344}{44413}- I've got a cake.|- Oh, very nice.
{44454}{44503}(Doorbell)
{44556}{44620}- Hello, Mrs Redmond.|- Hello.
{44622}{44714}- It's Danny. Danny Campbell.|- Ah, right.
{44716}{44775}You want Frank? He's...in the kitchen.
{44777}{44826}(Doorbell)
{44963}{45018}Come in.
{45020}{45069}He's in the kitchen.
{46681}{46732}Keep your eyes open, James.
{46734}{46763}In here.
{46787}{46836}On you go.
{46848}{46894}- All right, Rob?|- Danny, how's things?
{46896}{46966}Aye, not bad. Skint, no job, no girlfriend.
{46968}{47043}And I've been wearing big Janine's knickers|since last February.
{47045}{47127}I can't complain.|It's not easy that, doing a woman's job.
{47173}{47259}Here, I'll leave you to it.|Rather you than me.
{47261}{47315}- You OK?|- Yeah.
{47317}{47388}Leave it alone, you big numpty.
{47390}{47451}And try to stay on your feet.
{47453}{47511}I saw Dad down the pool again.|What's he up to?
{47513}{47574}- Swimming.|- It seems he's there all the time.
{47576}{47629}Well, it does him good. Away you go.
{47656}{47732}- How did they both manage to fall over?|- Practice.
{47783}{47843}- May we go up to our room?|- Yes, you can.
{47845}{47911}I didn't know you had this.
{47955}{48032}Angela dug it out. It's a good sand boat.
{48069}{48164}Well, that's all you ever wanted to make,|both of you. It must be in your blood.
{48187}{48221}Biscuit?
{48248}{48317}- I go up there now and then.|- Mm, I know.
{48661}{48695}Mum?
{48781}{48836}I failed my bus test.
{49007}{49045}That's not bad.
{49047}{49126}Time's faster and you're getting|more distance from the strokes.
{49128}{49189}But it's still a long way from the real thing.
{49253}{49318}You'd be better at bus driving than me.
{49320}{49401}I thought about it. Kept seeing those ads.
{49403}{49455}So, why didn't you tell us?
{49511}{49558}There's no sugar in this.
{49601}{49675}- Can you take it again?|- You get three goes.
{49677}{49748}You should try for it. You'd be good.
{49750}{49838}What, and have Angela give up work?|She earns twice what I could.
{49840}{49935}- I've said I can help with the twins.|- And I've said they're my kids.
{49937}{50034}If I'm not prepared to look after them,|then we shouldn't have had them.
{50052}{50121}- What?|- You're like your Dad.
{50402}{50453}Right, boys, over to the side of the pool.
{50477}{50526}Right, go on beside Campbell.
{50545}{50590}Good boy.
{50619}{50705}Aaron, when you get to the side of the pool,|just stop and wait.
{50837}{50886}Hold on, Jonathan.
{51225}{51274}- You OK?|- It's all right, he's fine.
{51276}{51364}- I'm all right.|- It's the way he swims. It's OK, just leave him.
{51383}{51422}Thank you.
{51734}{51776}- Yes!|- Yes.
{51778}{51830}Did you see that, big man?
{52483}{52544}- Call that swimming?|- Aye.
{52669}{52735}- Have you got a name?|- Aaron.
{52806}{52855}Good name.
{52873}{52922}Good swimmer.
{53068}{53102}Rob, hurry up.
{53385}{53454}- Come on, let's go.|- He's probably not here.
{53456}{53528}You said he comes here all the time.|Unless you don't want to.
{53530}{53629}I'm coming. And I didn't say "all of the time".|I said "some of the time", smartarse.
{53631}{53664}Where are you going to?
{53666}{53720}- All right, Frank?|- All right, Danny.
{53743}{53788}- Who's that?|- I used to work with him.
{54417}{54485}ROB: I'm going to be first. No cheating.
{54508}{54524}Ah.
{54526}{54603}- You got a head start.|- Ah, my toe. Stubbed my toe.
{54605}{54654}ROB: Who won the race?|BOY: You.
{54690}{54739}ANGELA: Somebody's going to get caught.
{54741}{54801}- Whose clothes are whose?|- Anyone else in here?
{54803}{54851}ROB: No, no, you're safe.
{54853}{54915}Will you come out?|Why are you hiding in there?
{54917}{54978}Get out of there.|You've got the shampoo?
{54980}{55010}Have l?
{55012}{55086}ANGELA: Why do men's changing rooms|always smell of P-I-S-S?
{55088}{55168}You're lucky, normally they smell of S-H-l-T.
{55170}{55204}What does that spell?
{55206}{55255}(Laughter)
{55326}{55421}ROB: Right, clothes on. What's first?|ANGELA: Come on. Let's get dressed.
{55440}{55509}ROB: Your coat. You're freezing.
{56198}{56247}- See you Monday.|- Excuse me.
{56333}{56382}See you Monday.
{56524}{56584}- Just the three.|- Danny.
{56621}{56720}Get his change right, Shirley.|He'll be watching the pennies.
{57487}{57596}It's not even May. You can't go|swimming outdoors this time of year.
{57598}{57669}I've got to get colder.|I'm going to Loch Lomond tomorrow.
{57671}{57756}- There's frost forecast.|- I think we should all do it, lend a bit of morale.
{57758}{57837}- I'll do it. What about you, Eddie?|- Oh, yeah, count me in.
{57839}{57930}Not me. I support much better when I'm dry.|I'm more your dry kind of supporter.
{57932}{57999}- Nice cake, Norman.|- Yeah, less salt this time.
{58118}{58142}Here we go.
{58223}{58272}Come on, Eddie.
{58331}{58368}Where are you going?
{58387}{58470}Eddie, come on in. You can do this.
{58710}{58760}DANNY: Hold on, Frank!
{58762}{58811}I'II be right with you.
{58909}{58963}Don't worry, son. It'll grow back.
{58965}{59023}It better had. I'm playing football later on.
{59025}{59083}Here we go, lads.|Nice cold beers to warm you up.
{59085}{59126}Cheers, Norman.
{59128}{59177}- Hey, slainte.|- Slainte.
{59212}{59256}The fire of the crucible.
{59258}{59332}- God, what is the fire of the crucible?|- A Chinese proverb.
{59334}{59386}From now on you have to train in the cold.
{59388}{59463}Not only that, you have to swim|25 miles a week six days a week.
{59465}{59522}- (Laughs)|- Here, I've got one for you, Chan.
{59524}{59620}Man who walks through airport turnstile|sideways is going to Bangkok.
{59775}{59834}How did you know he's going to Bangkok?
{59836}{59868}DANNY: Bang cock.
{59870}{59911}Bang cock.
{59967}{60058}We still need to get a hold of a boat|so we can support Frank in the water.
{60060}{60153}- I told you, Merv the Perv's got a boat.|- But do you think he'd let us have a go on it?
{60155}{60226}I don't see why not.|He'd let you have a go with his wife.
{60244}{60308}Bang cock! Bang co...
{60310}{60355}(Laughter)
{60655}{60691}Oh, no, I can't.
{60693}{60772}I thought I could but I can't.|I'll see you at the bus stop.
{60774}{60804}MERV: Hey!
{60806}{60847}Hey, over here.
{60849}{60898}Come on.
{60931}{60980}Don't be shy, give it a try.
{61040}{61091}Merv, it's Frank. Can I have a word?
{61109}{61173}Ooh, hiya, Frank.
{61174}{61238}- Hey, Vera, it's Frank.|- (Muffled) Oh, hello, Frank.
{61239}{61295}- Hi, Vera.|MERV: How's Joan?
{61297}{61357}Joan's... She's fine. She's... Yeah.
{61359}{61391}(Muffled talk)
{61393}{61493}Oh, she's still after Joan's recipe|for that lemon cheesecake.
{61495}{61589}I'll remind her.|Listen, I'm sorry, is... Is this a bad time?
{61591}{61661}- Cos I could come back later...|- No, no, it's great, Frank.
{61698}{61831}Norman says you've got a boat.|I was wondering if maybe we could...borrow it.
{61854}{61929}- I want to shag it.|- Merv probably has.
{61931}{61978}Are you sure you know what you're doing?
{61980}{62048}Of course I do. I used to be in the sea cadets.
{62050}{62115}A bit different|to a leaky canoe on the Clyde, this.
{62117}{62202}- Don't worry, I'll be careful.|- Yeah, well, just make sure you are.
{62221}{62264}Are you not coming, Norman?
{62266}{62367}Get on there with the missing link at the helm?|You're joking, aren't you?
{62369}{62485}No, I'll leave it till I find my sea legs.|Next time, maybe.
{62524}{62588}- Help!|- Slow down!
{62680}{62718}Right then.
{62745}{62794}(Engine won't start)
{62863}{62947}- Ah, you flooded it.|- I'll fix it. Just give us a minute.
{62949}{62998}Norman!
{63000}{63034}Help!
{63036}{63092}EDDlE: Norman!
{63094}{63132}(Engine starts)
{63197}{63237}Oh!
{63262}{63292}Oh, shite!
{63584}{63606}Bollocks!
{63636}{63676}Aaargh!
{64265}{64314}Keep your eye on that, will you?
{64451}{64500}What's on your mind, son?
{64520}{64565}- I've been thinking.|- What with?
{64599}{64685}I was thinking...|I could have a go at the Channel, too.
{64687}{64749}- Yeah?|- Yeah.
{64751}{64791}What do you think?
{64793}{64838}Do you think you're up to it?
{64840}{64902}Oh, yeah. Definitely.
{64904}{64958}- Yeah?|- Definitely.
{65223}{65265}DANNY: AII right, Rob?
{65292}{65336}Evening, Janine.
{65338}{65408}Pint of lager,|eight packets of crisps, assorted flavours,
{65410}{65464}no prawn cocktail, two pork pies,
{65466}{65530}three ham sandwiches,|and a pint of Guinness, please.
{65532}{65620}I'm in training, swimming.|I've got to bulk up.
{65622}{65680}- You're swimming?|- Training.
{65682}{65734}But I'm getting mentally prepared.
{65736}{65776}I'm in mental training.
{65778}{65869}- So how's things with you, then?|- The same.
{65897}{65947}How is the big fella?
{65949}{65979}What?
{65981}{66054}Your little boy?|He fell on his arse the last time I saw you.
{66056}{66081}Oh, yeah.
{66083}{66150}He's all right. He does it all the time.
{66152}{66253}- He bounces back quick enough.|- Oh, yeah. They're very bouncy, kids.
{66255}{66348}Like balls or castles. Still...
{66350}{66443}It's got to be the most difficult job in the world,|that, being a dad.
{66445}{66494}Probably why mine left us.
{66532}{66593}But you don't miss what you never had, do you?
{66675}{66730}Make sure you stay in front of him, Frank.
{66732}{66808}If the water suddenly gets warm,|that'll be Danny.
{66852}{66900}- How many have you eaten?|- Just the one.
{66902}{66941}Well, get rid of it.
{67011}{67047}Right, OK.
{67049}{67164}Don't do anything stupid.|If you get into trouble, go to the boat. Yeah?
{67166}{67239}All right. Now remember, we're not superheroes.
{67241}{67293}- I hear you. I'm good.|- OK, let's go.
{67295}{67352}What's that?
{67354}{67398}Jellyfish.
{67416}{67457}They're fine. They're fine.
{67535}{67592}Come on!
{67668}{67717}- It's colder than last time.|- Slow down.
{67719}{67799}DANNY: Come on, here we go.|FRANK: Right, hey, Danny.
{67801}{67850}- Watch this.|- Pace yourself.
{68446}{68510}TAPE: You are king of the jungle.
{68550}{68599}I am a lion.
{68629}{68680}Now repeat after me...
{68866}{68915}(Gasping)
{69051}{69100}Right, there you go, Frank.
{69149}{69213}Why can't they just hold onto the boat and get it?
{69215}{69318}Frank wants to do it right.|If they touch the boat, the swim won't count.
{69738}{69812}Now repeat after me,|you are not a man, you are a wolf.
{69814}{69881}(Tape on fast rewind)
{69904}{69951}(Car horn)
{70089}{70183}- Eddie! He's got cramp.|- Start the boat, Chan. Start the boat.
{70185}{70256}Danny! Danny, hold on!
{70258}{70298}- Danny!|- Hold on, Danny!
{70300}{70346}(Engine won't start)
{70389}{70432}It won't start.
{70629}{70701}It's OK. Calm down. Take it easy.
{71440}{71505}- What did the doctor say?|- It's fine.
{71507}{71586}The doctor says he's going to be all right,|no thanks to you.
{71588}{71642}He looks to you like a dad.
{71644}{71687}You should have stopped him.
{71719}{71809}- It wasn't Frank's fault, Ma.|- I will not have him go in the water again.
{71811}{71851}Ma, it was my own fault.
{72002}{72051}I just wanted to be the man for once.
{72105}{72184}Olympic superstar, Nike sponsorship.
{72186}{72241}Just be the man, you know?
{72298}{72347}Like you.
{72443}{72494}I didn't want you to be disappointed.
{72520}{72597}I was when I found out|it was Eddie that gave me the kiss of life.
{72700}{72774}- Are you going training now?|- Mm.
{72776}{72831}Put some down for me, will you?
{72860}{72944}He can help out. On the boat or something.
{72966}{73041}But he wears a lifejacket|if he's anywhere near you.
{73145}{73226}- So his mother's not too happy, then?|- I should have stopped him.
{73228}{73285}Remember you stopped Rob swimming in here?
{73287}{73323}Yeah, he was seven.
{73325}{73408}He cursed like mad when I pulled him out|because his mates were watching.
{73410}{73455}Jumped right back in again.
{73457}{73532}Ah, you know,|if I had disobeyed my father at that age,
{73534}{73583}he'd have beat the hell out of me.
{73607}{73656}But I loved him.
{73689}{73729}I've never hit Rob.
{73731}{73773}Ever. Not once.
{73815}{73884}We never can find two words|to say to each other.
{73967}{74018}Seems like everything's backwards.
{74067}{74100}FRANK: That's us.
{74102}{74199}CHAN: Frank, you need to build up|your stamina so we need to go for a big one.
{74201}{74262}CHAN: 1 5 miles, OK?|FRANK: OK.
{74264}{74358}CHAN: Have you been for a medical.|FRANK: Yeah, I got the all-clear.
{74378}{74446}Why don't we just take a chance|and go down to Dover?
{74448}{74505}It's a long way to go if we don't find somebody.
{74507}{74599}You said yourself,|if we don't find a pilot, you can't swim.
{74601}{74669}OK. OK. I'll go there later this week.
{74671}{74746}I'll come for the ride.|Get a saver, should be cheap enough.
{74748}{74857}Take Danny, too.|Make sure he brings his water wings this time.
{75099}{75139}It said "apply thickly".
{75170}{75219}EDDlE: Maybe we overdid it.
{75556}{75605}- I'm sorry.|- Oh!
{75607}{75647}Was it the lorry?
{75649}{75706}But he swerved first. Lunatic!
{75708}{75834}Mrs Redmond, you need to be more...|I'll let you go one more time.
{76048}{76079}There.
{76097}{76190}Right, I've just had a word with the barmaid.
{76192}{76262}Apparently there is a guy that can do it.
{76264}{76323}Goes by the name of Mad Bob.
{76325}{76358}Mad Bob?
{76387}{76435}He doesn't sound normal.
{76437}{76506}He sounds frigging nuts. Is he here?
{76508}{76552}You looking for a boat?
{76575}{76659}- We might be.|- Either you are or you're not.
{76717}{76741}We are.
{76743}{76820}- So it's you that's going to be swimming?|- Mm-hm.
{76996}{77087}If you can't beat me,|you ain't the man to do the swim.
{77106}{77155}And I ain't the man to take you.
{77227}{77278}I take it you're Mad Bob?
{77503}{77535}We go on three.
{77656}{77680}One...
{77710}{77752}..two...
{77775}{77791}three!
{77816}{77875}BOB: 850 the crossing. 200 deposit.
{77877}{77918}No refunds.
{77920}{77978}But we get to see your boat?
{77980}{78010}What for?
{78012}{78071}We get to see the boat.
{78073}{78128}Righty-ho, you get to see the boat.
{78187}{78231}Shark.
{78233}{78266}35-footer.
{78420}{78490}Fell off my bike. Two-wheeler.
{78509}{78550}FRANK: Let's go.
{78608}{78657}BOB: There she is.
{78717}{78755}Is this yours?
{78823}{78866}FRANK: It's all right.
{78884}{78920}It's good.
{78922}{78981}Yeah, very nice.
{79006}{79065}CHAN: There you go, fellas.|FRANK: What date is it?
{79067}{79122}EDDlE: 22nd June.|CHAN: Aye, it's the 22nd.
{79124}{79218}NORMAN: Hang on. Is that a two or a five?|- You sure?
{79220}{79269}Yeah, it's the 22nd.
{79350}{79407}ROB: One...two...three!
{79459}{79498}(Cheering)
{79500}{79548}* Forthey are jolly good fellows
{79550}{79609}* For they are jolly good fellows
{79620}{79688}* For they are jolly good fellows
{79690}{79739}* And so say all of us
{79751}{79785}* And so say all of us
{79787}{79841}- Where were you?|- Sorry, I got held up.
{79843}{79902}- I'll get you some food.|- No, it's fine, I've...
{79904}{79953}And a nice big piece of cake.
{80034}{80093}- Were you waiting for me?|- They were.
{80095}{80171}It's fine. It worked out better.|Come on, let's go crazy.
{80173}{80222}(Shrieking)
{80357}{80391}Hey!
{80431}{80464}Here.
{80466}{80516}So what did you get them?
{80518}{80614}The kids? Since when did I do the shopping?|Your mother likes to get those things.
{80650}{80711}You got them those racetracks.
{80713}{80772}Mum still does that thing|where she signs the card
{80774}{80840}and makes it look like you've signed it, too.
{80943}{80984}How's the swimming coming on?
{80986}{81056}I heard you are going to swim|the English Channel.
{81195}{81266}- I didn't tell her.|- You were right not to.
{81268}{81309}- Why?|- Because you heard wrong.
{81340}{81424}I heard that Danny parked Merv's boat|halfway up the beach
{81426}{81498}and that you are planning|to swim the Channel this summer.
{81500}{81554}Danny gets carried away.
{81708}{81765}- Saw you down the library.|- I like reading.
{81767}{81824}- Saw you down the pool.|- I like swimming.
{81845}{81865}What?
{81918}{81977}I'm going to get some jelly|before it's all gone.
{82184}{82240}You can have another go, can't you?
{82242}{82306}I just can't seem to concentrate lately.
{82307}{82409}- You told him at last, then?|- No, it's not that. It's...something else.
{82454}{82503}I think he might be having an affair.
{82602}{82641}But he's acting so odd.
{82643}{82721}- I'm sorry, that's just daft. I mean...|- Well, there's Vera.
{82723}{82757}(Michelle Iaughs)
{82759}{82823}It's not funny.|She rang last week and...
{82824}{82892}It's probably just got something|to do with the boat.
{82894}{82952}- What boat?|- The boat.
{82954}{83034}The lads are borrowing a boat|to help Frank swim the Channel.
{83058}{83092}What channel?
{83126}{83174}Thank you.
{83842}{83892}- Nice.|- Mm.
{83983}{84040}You know we were talking about buying a car?
{84065}{84135}Hm, I fixed the wing mirror back on.
{84153}{84242}Well, Michelle says|Arthur Hall is selling his Metro. It's red.
{84269}{84339}- Thought we said a new car could wait?|- No, we didn't. You did.
{84390}{84455}Well, we have to be careful|with the money from now on.
{84457}{84532}Michelle says the insides are just like new.
{84598}{84707}She also says you've been borrowing Merv's|boat to help you train to swim the Channel.
{84709}{84821}The English Channel. And I was wondering|when you were thinking about telling me.
{84953}{85033}I was also wondering how it is|we can't afford a new car
{85035}{85134}but you can afford to pay for a boat|to show you the way to bloody France.
{85208}{85319}I'd be worried about you trying to swim|all that way, Frank, if I wasn 't so angry.
{85420}{85534}I've never asked you for anything, Frank.|But honesty was something I took for granted.
{86792}{86858}Well, look who it is - the three wise monkeys.
{86860}{86962}Rob, your dad's got a few more lengths to do.|Why don't we wait for him outside?
{86964}{87047}I know about his little secret.|I just want to talk to him, all right?
{87049}{87073}- Come on.|- Eddie...
{87075}{87099}Hey!
{87257}{87306}You're a liar, Dad.
{87333}{87403}You lied to me about swimming the Channel.
{87473}{87528}- Maybe I did.|- Why?
{87612}{87676}- Is it because I don't have a job?|- It's not about you.
{87678}{87771}Because I look after the twins?|I'm not ashamed of that, Dad.
{87773}{87831}I'm not ashamed like you think I should be.
{87833}{87893}Good. You're not ashamed.
{87895}{87944}No, but you are.
{87996}{88045}You're the one who's ashamed!
{88081}{88149}- I'm not listening to this.|- Why? What are you afraid of?
{88151}{88215}Afraid I'll drown? Look at me, I'm drowning.
{88375}{88412}36 years.
{88423}{88470}36 years.
{88472}{88536}1 2 hours a day, five days a week.
{88537}{88642}Now you tell me,|when was I supposed to go shopping?
{88844}{88893}(Coughs)
{89624}{89678}He'll be OK. Just needs time to cool off.
{89696}{89752}We need to make sure you keep up the times.
{89754}{89807}- No.|- What?
{89809}{89833}No.
{90048}{90091}- I can't do it.|EDDlE: But, Frank...
{90093}{90137}I can't do it.
{90164}{90230}FRANK: He's right.|- Come on, Frank. Come on.
{90232}{90286}I'm not going to be swimming.
{90831}{90880}(Turns engine off)
{90905}{90959}Your father didn't mean to hurt you.
{91069}{91118}I was married once.
{91203}{91260}Her name was Bridget.
{91262}{91319}She left me for a jam salesman.
{91361}{91423}She never even liked jam.
{91520}{91579}I didn't bother with women again after that.
{91581}{91647}I was too scared|the same thing would happen all over.
{91679}{91756}If anyone tried to get close,|I just pushed them away.
{91858}{91944}Your father did the same thing with you|after the accident.
{91946}{91983}Pushed you away.
{92027}{92073}He blames me.
{92101}{92151}No, he doesn't.
{92153}{92215}He blames himself. Always has.
{92335}{92411}Now you're soaking the seat|and it's leather. It'll stain.
{93641}{93683}All that way, Frank.
{93914}{93962}I thought we were too old for secrets.
{94072}{94129}Like learning how to drive a bus?
{94421}{94485}There was an ad in the paper.
{94522}{94571}I failed twice.
{94618}{94693}But I'm going to take it again.|I'm not giving up.
{95413}{95462}Let's just play when it smashes.
{95485}{95556}All right, you ready?|You take that one, all right?
{95849}{95911}ANGELA: We're not catching the train, James.
{95913}{95992}There's no point in racing,|I've got the keys, remember.
{96115}{96174}- (Whispers) Pappy?|- Sh!
{96215}{96286}- Are you playing a game?|- Yeah.
{96288}{96370}ANGELA: Don't make me come back out.|- You better go inside.
{96483}{96541}- Is it a secret?|- Yeah.
{96543}{96591}Like Daddy's wee brother?
{96631}{96724}He says we mustn't talk about him.|That it makes you sad.
{96742}{96788}Does it make you sad?
{96815}{96865}Sometimes.
{96914}{96970}- I won't tell.|- Good boy.
{97073}{97120}Are you going to swim the Channel?
{97164}{97226}I don't know. What do you think?
{97228}{97279}Dad says it's too dangerous.
{97364}{97414}What is the Channel?
{97416}{97514}It's the sea between England and France.
{97565}{97618}Are there any...sharks?
{97620}{97665}No sharks.
{97667}{97740}- Crocodiles?|- Mm-mn.
{97742}{97795}- Piranhas?|- Bananas?
{97797}{97877}- Piranhas?|- Piranhas!
{97879}{97931}No, no piranhas.
{97933}{97995}It doesn't sound too dangerous to me, then.
{97997}{98046}ANGELA: I'II count to five.
{98307}{98361}I can swim like a fish.
{98616}{98692}ANGELA: Are you stopping out here all day|or are you coming in?
{99525}{99589}Hey, big man, you not swimming?
{100210}{100234}Yes!
{100356}{100420}That's 5 Pounds you owe me. I told you he'd be here.
{100573}{100614}We're the delegation.
{100645}{100693}A delegation?
{100695}{100791}- It's a kind of a gang.|- Thanks for that, Danny.
{100871}{100924}Does the delegation have a proposal?
{100926}{100972}EDDlE: Yeah.
{100974}{101019}We think you're wrong to give up.
{101021}{101070}Now we've come this far.
{101104}{101189}- We also think you're a big daft bollocks...|- See him?
{101191}{101237}See that little laddie with red hair?
{101297}{101385}It takes everything out of him|just to swim one width. Just one.
{101431}{101519}He won't take any help and he never gives up.
{101545}{101577}Ever.
{101696}{101764}- And when he gets to the other side...|- Yes!
{101855}{101904}I'm not giving up.
{102395}{102438}That toilet needs cleaning again.
{102584}{102618}Do it yourself.
{102954}{103000}He's on his knees and she's...
{103002}{103051}Take it steady.
{103069}{103126}All right, ladies? Pam.
{103128}{103181}- Oh, my God!|- All right, love?
{103206}{103274}- You nearly finished?|- Uh-huh.
{103276}{103325}Only I thought we might go out.
{103357}{103399}You mean together?
{103529}{103616}Oh, aye. You and me. Me and you.
{103790}{103819}Excuse me.
{103851}{103895}Please don't drop the bags.
{103897}{103928}They split.
{103952}{103986}Oh, aye?
{104017}{104058}Sorry, pal.
{104200}{104283}- See you Wednesday.|- See you Wednesday.
{104602}{104634}I nearly drowned.
{104636}{104695}- We heard.|- In the sea.
{104697}{104793}- What were you doing in the sea?|- I don't know.
{104795}{104835}Do you want to go out with me?
{104904}{104937}Yeah!
{104939}{104987}Good.
{104989}{105028}That's good.
{105077}{105124}Happy days.
{105394}{105437}(Shipping forecast on radio)
{105532}{105588}You smell of chlorine.
{105590}{105651}Like Dad when he was laid out.
{105737}{105802}He used to smell of oil and Woodbines.
{105895}{105944}I was 1 6.
{105980}{106037}You came round to talk to Dad about something.
{106073}{106131}I couldn't believe how handsome you were.
{106368}{106422}I'm learning to drive a bus.
{106440}{106517}And then, if I pass, I'm going to drive a bus.
{106544}{106602}It'll be my job, a proper job.
{106641}{106690}Driving a bus.
{106751}{106800}I'm going up.
{106825}{106900}So should you. You have a big day tomorrow.
{107856}{107914}Thanks for the sandwiches.
{107932}{107971}Good luck.
{107973}{108091}That...time when I came to see your father...
{108112}{108143}I didn't.
{108193}{108237}I came to see you.
{108426}{108478}DANNY: I spy with my little eye...
{108480}{108548}- You'll never get this. A.|FRANK: Air freshener.
{108550}{108584}EDDlE: Ambulance.|- No.
{108586}{108638}- You might get it, Norman.|NORMAN: Why?
{108640}{108713}Because you're nearer it.|You could say you're on it.
{108715}{108758}- I'm on it?|- Kind of.
{108760}{108793}EDDlE: Arse.|- No.
{108795}{108856}You'd have that as well.|Unless it was Norman's arse.
{108858}{108935}NORMAN: Leave my arse out of this.|DANNY: And that would be N-A.
{109781}{109830}(Gulls cry)
{110071}{110135}- You OK with heights?|- Yeah.
{110170}{110225}- You?|- Oh, yeah.
{110227}{110276}- You sure?|- Mm-hm.
{110352}{110442}FRANK: I was thinking about Joan.|I should have told her.
{110496}{110545}Don't know what I was hiding.
{110598}{110689}- Maybe we should leave him alone.|- Why? We should be there for him.
{110691}{110783}- What if he doesn't want us there?|- Oh, you're as pig-headed as your father.
{110785}{110880}Of course he wants us there.|He just doesn't know how to ask.
{110882}{110962}- But he's not going to achieve anything by it.|- How do you know?
{110964}{111060}Because he's not going to bring Stuart back|by swimming the Channel.
{111108}{111162}Oh, Rob.
{111164}{111235}It's not Stuart he wants back.
{111338}{111372}I'm away.
{111532}{111614}- Mum, thanks for the toys.|- It's OK.
{111684}{111733}What toys?
{111900}{111937}(Fart)
{111939}{112018}DANNY: Better out than in, right?|EDDlE: For God's sake!
{112050}{112127}NORMAN: One more of them|and you're sleeping in the car.
{112129}{112176}(Sniggering)
{112178}{112267}FRANK: I knew a guy once|could fart in German.
{112269}{112318}(Laughter)
{112601}{112647}You took your time.
{112666}{112715}I'm sitting in the front.
{112853}{112907}The observer fellow seems all right.
{113090}{113148}Right, it's five o'clock. Let's get cracking.
{113150}{113239}OK, don't forget, don't touch the boat|or anyone on it once you get going
{113241}{113289}or it will invalidate your swim.
{113291}{113334}When you get to France, get on dry land,
{113336}{113392}pick up a stone and bring it back to the boat.
{113394}{113437}OK.
{113439}{113500}- Good luck.|- Thank you. Thank you.
{113549}{113573}Well, go.
{113575}{113623}- Good luck, mate.|- Good luck, Frank.
{113625}{113677}Thanks, lads.
{113679}{113708}Right.
{113809}{113840}See yous.
{113842}{113935}- You're not joining us?|- No, I don't float very well.
{113937}{113987}Me, neither.
{114057}{114081}OK.
{114281}{114330}(Boat's engine starts up)
{115608}{115665}Come on, Frank.
{115667}{115711}That's the way.
{116854}{116915}Ah, we'll be there in no time, Frank.
{116958}{117007}It's a nice rhythm, that.
{117046}{117118}One, two, three, four...
{117150}{117243}I'm all right, Frank. I'm all right. Carry on.
{117330}{117432}- You passed, didn't you?|- I thought you'd never ask.
{117434}{117510}Well done, Mum.|Congratulations, that's brilliant!
{117512}{117570}JOAN: I think we should celebrate|with a gum drop.
{118038}{118106}- The fumes are killing me.|- I can't help that.
{118159}{118223}I'm keeping this close to keep you on course.
{118263}{118315}FRANK: I can't breathe.
{118317}{118383}- I'll go ahead.|- Well, what bloody use will I be then?
{118446}{118515}Stupid bastard. Bloody fool.
{118707}{118771}TAPE: I am confident.
{118772}{118854}- I am confident.|- I am a Iion.
{118856}{118915}I am a lion.|I'm not a timorous beastie.
{118917}{118970}I am a lion.
{119437}{119492}EDDlE: He's doing great.|- No, he's not.
{119494}{119569}At this rate he's not going to make it to the cap|before the ebb tide.
{119571}{119636}And if he doesn't,|he's going to get swept back out to sea.
{119638}{119687}- lsn't that being bleak?|- No, he's right.
{119689}{119765}BOB: Look, I'II pick up the pace|and he's going to have to keep up.
{119767}{119815}CHAN: Better do some hypothermia checks.
{119817}{119859}Can we get closer to him?
{119963}{120036}Frank, where are you swimming from?
{120063}{120095}England.
{120097}{120187}- Where in England?|- Dover.
{120189}{120260}- What day is it?|- What?
{120262}{120360}- What day is it?|- Thursday.
{120362}{120397}He seems all right.
{120713}{120759}Come on.
{120761}{120855}I didn't think to ask|where in France he was swimming to.
{120857}{120942}- There. That's where he's swimming to.|ANGELA: How do you know?
{120944}{121001}- Pappy showed me.|- When did Pappy show you?
{121003}{121048}I'm not telling you.
{121161}{121215}BOB: How many times did you try it yourself?
{121217}{121251}Three.
{121253}{121320}- Did you ever make it?|- Third time lucky.
{121572}{121621}(Gulls cry)
{121645}{121695}There it is. Sortie - way out.
{122203}{122260}- What is it?|- Ebb tide.
{122297}{122379}BOB: It's dragging him back out.|EDDlE: What if he can't beat it?
{122381}{122483}- Can't you do anything?|- He's in for the long haul.
{122485}{122545}- He won't be able to last that long.|- Yes, he will.
{122547}{122594}CHAN: His body temperature is dropping.
{122596}{122660}If he doesn't make this beach,|he won't make it at all.
{122702}{122740}EDDlE: Frank!
{122742}{122807}You've only three miles to go, Frank.
{122809}{122874}I know you're hurting,|but you got to swim faster.
{122876}{122973}The tide's against you.|Frank, you've got to swim faster. Come on!
{123150}{123202}You can do it, Frank.
{123204}{123253}You can do it.

{124693}{124749}Come on, Frank, come on.
{125614}{125630}No!
{125658}{125700}Is he all right?

{125736}{125813}(Joan cries)
{125815}{125862}(Yells)
{125925}{125959}Bloody hell!
{126412}{126479}I need to come out, lads.
{126517}{126559}What do you think you're doing?
{126561}{126642}Why don't you just take it slower for a wee while,|see if it passes?
{126644}{126695}I'm sorry, Chan.
{126697}{126747}I can't do it, mate.
{126749}{126807}You're nearly there. Look it's not far.
{126809}{126838}I can't do it.
{126840}{126918}OBSERVER: Your body is hurting|because you're burning your fat.
{126920}{126966}It won't Iast. You'II get through it.
{126968}{127042}Yeah, Frank. It's just the pain barrier.|It's all in your mind.
{127044}{127132}- Get me out! It's too far.|- Bollocks! It's always been this far.
{127134}{127230}- You come in and swim it, then!|- Fine. Get on board and we all can go home.
{127232}{127302}All my life I've looked up to you, Frank.
{127304}{127338}All my life.
{127340}{127428}- I never saw you back down from anything.|- It's too far.
{127430}{127503}I'm nobody but you know that.
{127505}{127571}But I'm not daft. I see what's going on here.
{127606}{127655}Out here in the middle of nowhere.
{127726}{127787}But he's not here, is he, Frank?
{127820}{127869}He never was.
{127910}{127969}It's taken you 23 years to find that out.
{128086}{128120}So what now?
{128190}{128239}Well, I'll tell you what now.
{128271}{128371}You get back to swimming|and you shut up about how far it is.
{128373}{128430}And you shut up about how much it hurts.
{128432}{128498}Because you don't have a choice.|You never did.
{128564}{128616}So, come on.
{128618}{128672}Get stuck in and put some down.
{128674}{128723}We're wasting time.
{129008}{129057}I'll go on, then.
{129244}{129273}ANGELA: It's him!
{129290}{129333}No, I can't see for sure but...
{129335}{129385}- Yeah, that's Frank!|JOAN: Let me see!
{129894}{129950}Right there. Look. Can you see him?
{130059}{130115}Come on. Let's go.
{130117}{130161}Come on, I need to be there, Mum.
{130163}{130213}Come on, Mum!
{130215}{130249}My God!
{132872}{132966}If he touches him before he gets out of the water|the swim won't be recognised.
{132968}{133063}- Don't, Rob!|- Don't touch him!
{133065}{133081}Frank!
{133126}{133177}Let him get out the water!
{133663}{133704}What's he want?
{133983}{134027}Oh, God!
{134438}{134468}What?
{134504}{134561}Did I miss something?
{134642}{134689}- Yes!|- Yes!
{134756}{134785}Yes!
