1
00:00:33,699 --> 00:00:36,907
<i>It all started
27 years ago.</i>

2
00:00:37,002 --> 00:00:38,697
<i>That's an orphanage.</i>

3
00:00:38,771 --> 00:00:42,434
<i>That's me in the basket.
I guess somebody didn't want me.</i>

4
00:00:42,508 --> 00:00:44,999
<i>I hear they did want
the basket back, though.</i>

5
00:00:45,077 --> 00:00:47,045
<i>But it was fine in the orphanage.</i>

6
00:00:47,112 --> 00:00:49,239
<i>That's me in the third row.</i>

7
00:00:49,315 --> 00:00:51,044
<i>I wasn't very popular.</i>

8
00:00:51,116 --> 00:00:53,710
<i>Of course, everybody wanted to be adopted.</i>

9
00:00:53,786 --> 00:00:55,879
<i>Luckily, lots of families came.</i>

10
00:00:55,955 --> 00:00:58,753
<i>And everybody got to go live with a family.</i>

11
00:00:58,824 --> 00:01:00,724
<i>Oh, except me.</i>

12
00:01:00,793 --> 00:01:03,193
<i>But I tried not to give up hope.</i>

13
00:01:03,262 --> 00:01:05,230
<i>Then, one day,</i>

14
00:01:05,297 --> 00:01:08,494
<i>something magical happened,
just like out of a fairy tale.</i>

15
00:01:08,567 --> 00:01:10,558
<i>Do you remember the one
where the wolf huffed and puffed</i>

16
00:01:10,636 --> 00:01:12,331
<i>and blew the piggies' house down?</i>

17
00:01:12,404 --> 00:01:15,396
<i>And he was wearing a glass slipper,
I think, and he had a pumpkin?</i>

18
00:01:15,474 --> 00:01:17,339
<i>Plus there was that other thing?</i>

19
00:01:17,409 --> 00:01:19,741
<i>Well, the same thing happened to me,</i>

20
00:01:19,812 --> 00:01:22,178
<i>only vastly different.</i>

21
00:01:22,247 --> 00:01:23,680
<i>I changed.</i>

22
00:01:23,749 --> 00:01:27,241
<i>And the next thing you know,
people seemed to like me for once.</i>

23
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:29,719
<i>And then pictures were taken,
and suddenly I found the family</i>

24
00:01:29,788 --> 00:01:31,380
<i>I always wanted.</i>

25
00:01:32,057 --> 00:01:35,356
<i>Oh, I forgot to tell you, my name is Shelley.</i>

26
00:01:35,427 --> 00:01:37,622
<i>Now I live in the Playboy Mansion.</i>

27
00:01:37,696 --> 00:01:41,860
<i>And this is where I want to live
happily ever after.</i>

28
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:02,550
- Throw the ball to me, Kim.
- Oh, nice catch. Awesome throw.

29
00:02:04,156 --> 00:02:06,249
- Hey, Lauren.
- Hi, Shelley!

30
00:02:07,393 --> 00:02:08,883
Hi, Hef! Hi, girls!

31
00:02:08,961 --> 00:02:11,156
Hi, Shelley. Looking good.

32
00:02:12,965 --> 00:02:15,331
- Marvin!
- Oh, hey, Shelley.

33
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:16,766
Thank you.

34
00:02:16,835 --> 00:02:20,464
You guys have to try one of these.
Marvin makes the best margaritas.

35
00:02:20,539 --> 00:02:24,202
That's 'cause they're mangoritas.
I invented them myself.

36
00:02:24,276 --> 00:02:26,608
I added my own little Marvin twist to them.

37
00:02:26,678 --> 00:02:29,977
Well, you're the best twister I know.

38
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:32,074
No, Shelley, you're the best twister.

39
00:02:32,151 --> 00:02:34,278
- Shelley.
- Hi!

40
00:02:34,353 --> 00:02:37,584
Why are you keeping the rich,
good-looking, famous guys all to yourself?

41
00:02:37,656 --> 00:02:39,817
- You should introduce me.
- Oh, of course.

42
00:02:39,892 --> 00:02:42,918
Guys, this is Cassandra.
She's only been here for a few months,

43
00:02:42,995 --> 00:02:45,429
but everybody loves her,
because she's super-beautiful

44
00:02:45,497 --> 00:02:48,864
and she never throws up on anybody
when she's drunk.

45
00:02:50,269 --> 00:02:53,204
So, Shelley, are you a centerfold?

46
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:56,468
She wishes.

47
00:02:56,542 --> 00:03:00,103
Yeah, I do. So keep all your fingers crossed.

48
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:03,444
Hopefully Hef'll give me the good news
this weekend at my birthday party.

49
00:03:03,515 --> 00:03:06,575
I've got my "turn ons" all ready
and everything.

50
00:03:06,652 --> 00:03:11,282
Being a centerfold is the highest,
most prestigious honor there is.

51
00:03:11,957 --> 00:03:15,358
It says,
"I'm naked in the middle of a magazine.

52
00:03:16,295 --> 00:03:18,126
"Unfold me."

53
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:20,961
I gotta tell you,
it seems you've got a pretty good life here.

54
00:03:21,033 --> 00:03:23,058
Oh, it's paradise.

55
00:03:23,135 --> 00:03:26,298
We are just one big family. I am so happy.

56
00:03:27,005 --> 00:03:29,735
Why would I wanna live anywhere else?

57
00:04:16,755 --> 00:04:18,723
I love this one. Don't you guys?

58
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:22,590
We'll put this on the Mansion tab
and have it all sent over this afternoon.

59
00:04:22,661 --> 00:04:25,824
Aren't we just the luckiest girls
in the whole world?

60
00:04:25,898 --> 00:04:27,661
Yes, you are.

61
00:04:28,433 --> 00:04:30,867
Your birthday party on Friday's
gonna be so much fun!

62
00:04:30,936 --> 00:04:31,925
Shelley!

63
00:04:32,004 --> 00:04:35,235
Oh, my God.
I bet you're gonna get Miss November.

64
00:05:43,308 --> 00:05:45,105
Good morning, Shelley.

65
00:05:45,177 --> 00:05:47,304
Rise and shine, sweetheart.

66
00:05:49,715 --> 00:05:51,683
Good morning, Marvin.

67
00:05:52,718 --> 00:05:56,051
Good morning, Pooter.
You're looking dapper.

68
00:05:57,623 --> 00:06:00,114
Your blueberry French toast is ready.

69
00:06:00,192 --> 00:06:01,523
<i>Ooh-la-la.</i>

70
00:06:01,593 --> 00:06:02,821
That's French, right?

71
00:06:02,894 --> 00:06:04,657
Yeah, but more important than the food,

72
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:07,062
I actually added something
to your orange juice.

73
00:06:07,132 --> 00:06:10,465
Oh, Marvin,
thank you so much for telling me.

74
00:06:10,535 --> 00:06:12,765
Usually I don't find out until much later.

75
00:06:12,838 --> 00:06:16,330
Oh, no. To add zest to the drink,
first I put in some vanilla extract,

76
00:06:16,408 --> 00:06:20,435
then, of course, some egg yolks,
and then, I have a secret ingredient.

77
00:06:20,512 --> 00:06:23,072
All right, you twisted my arm,
it's chili powder.

78
00:06:23,148 --> 00:06:28,142
Yeah. It just explodes your taste buds,
so the drink just envelops your mouth.

79
00:06:28,253 --> 00:06:30,847
Oh, I love having my mouth enveloped.

80
00:06:31,456 --> 00:06:32,889
What's that?

81
00:06:34,092 --> 00:06:37,027
Is this from Hef? Is this my birthday gift?

82
00:06:37,095 --> 00:06:40,064
Oh, Pooter, is it finally happening?
Am I Miss November?

83
00:06:40,132 --> 00:06:42,623
That's what I wished for
when I blew out my candle.

84
00:06:42,701 --> 00:06:45,226
Oh, my gosh, I just told you my wish.
Now it won't come true.

85
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:48,102
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to tell, it just came out.

86
00:06:48,173 --> 00:06:50,232
My teeth couldn't stop it.

87
00:06:50,776 --> 00:06:53,506
I take it all back, I take it all back.

88
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,307
Okay, I'm ready.

89
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:02,245
"Dear Shelley..." Oh, my gosh, that's me.

90
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:04,050
Wait, there's more.

91
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:07,782
"Please move out
of the Mansion immediately."

92
00:07:12,564 --> 00:07:13,929
Move out?

93
00:07:18,403 --> 00:07:22,737
"You have two hours to collect
your belongings and leave the premises.

94
00:07:24,109 --> 00:07:26,600
"All my love, Hef."

95
00:07:28,814 --> 00:07:30,611
Hef's kicking me out?

96
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,608
Why would he do that?

97
00:07:33,685 --> 00:07:36,347
This is my home. This is my family.

98
00:07:37,422 --> 00:07:41,756
I hate to say this, Shelley,
but maybe it's because of your age.

99
00:07:41,827 --> 00:07:43,988
But I'm 27.

100
00:07:44,062 --> 00:07:47,190
Yeah, but that's 59 in Bunny years.

101
00:07:48,066 --> 00:07:52,662
But I just turned 27 last night.

102
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:55,400
It's almost like I'm still 26.

103
00:07:55,474 --> 00:07:56,634
Or 58.

104
00:07:57,376 --> 00:08:00,641
I've gotta talk to Hef,
maybe he'll let me stay.

105
00:08:01,346 --> 00:08:02,506
Hef!

106
00:08:02,981 --> 00:08:04,175
Hef!

107
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:05,808
Hef!

108
00:08:06,485 --> 00:08:07,543
Hef!

109
00:08:09,821 --> 00:08:11,311
Where is he?

110
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:15,827
He left for Vegas, Shelley.
I don't think he's that good with goodbyes.

111
00:08:17,562 --> 00:08:19,723
Why is this all happening?

112
00:08:21,533 --> 00:08:23,433
Where's my pink Prius?

113
00:08:24,202 --> 00:08:29,037
The Prius actually belongs to the company.
This is the car you came here with.

114
00:08:30,075 --> 00:08:31,372
But...

115
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:38,940
Come on, Pooter.

116
00:08:39,017 --> 00:08:41,417
We have to go find a new place to live.

117
00:08:41,486 --> 00:08:42,953
Come on, now.

118
00:08:43,021 --> 00:08:45,046
Come here, Pooter.

119
00:08:45,123 --> 00:08:48,183
Here, let me help, Shelley. Hey, Pooter.
Shelley's calling you now.

120
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:51,093
Come on, Pooter.
Go with Shelley, buddy. Pooter!

121
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:53,996
That hurts! Go with Shelley, Pooter!

122
00:08:56,535 --> 00:08:57,832
Damn it!

123
00:09:03,775 --> 00:09:07,506
Why don't I just keep him here
for a little while, until he calms down?

124
00:09:07,579 --> 00:09:09,103
Okay.

125
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:10,910
Well, don't worry, Pooter.

126
00:09:10,982 --> 00:09:13,849
I'm gonna find us a really nice place to live,

127
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:16,080
and then maybe you'll wanna
come live with me.

128
00:09:16,154 --> 00:09:17,553
I'm sure he will.

129
00:09:17,622 --> 00:09:20,182
Well, you take care, Shelley.

130
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:32,862
Bye.

131
00:09:42,514 --> 00:09:45,039
I know it's an embarrassment
to live in a beat-up car,

132
00:09:45,116 --> 00:09:46,811
but don't lose faith, Pooter.

133
00:09:46,885 --> 00:09:48,409
I'm gonna get a great job soon,

134
00:09:48,487 --> 00:09:52,116
and find us a super place to live,
with a new family.

135
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:54,181
I pinkie promise, Pooter.

136
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:06,733
Good evening, ma'am.

137
00:10:07,606 --> 00:10:10,973
You violated Code 753.
That's unlawful spitting.

138
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:13,573
I was just brushing my teeth.

139
00:10:13,645 --> 00:10:16,045
You currently residing in this car, ma'am?

140
00:10:16,114 --> 00:10:18,378
I'm gonna have to issue another ticket.

141
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:22,113
Would you maybe stop giving me tickets
if I told you I was having a really bad week

142
00:10:22,187 --> 00:10:24,781
because I used to be a Playboy Bunny,
but I got kicked out of the Mansion

143
00:10:24,856 --> 00:10:27,154
because I'm 59 years old?

144
00:10:28,326 --> 00:10:33,059
I'm gonna have to ask you to step out
of the car and take a Breathalyzer.

145
00:10:33,131 --> 00:10:34,223
Okay.

146
00:10:38,737 --> 00:10:39,761
Noises.

147
00:10:39,838 --> 00:10:42,568
I'm gonna need you to blow on this.

148
00:10:42,641 --> 00:10:43,801
Really?

149
00:10:45,343 --> 00:10:47,402
I guess.

150
00:10:53,184 --> 00:10:54,947
You tried to do what?

151
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,282
To a cop?

152
00:10:59,057 --> 00:11:00,490
Stupid!

153
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:02,652
I was just doing what he said.

154
00:11:02,727 --> 00:11:04,490
He was in a uniform and everything.

155
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:07,396
Don't worry, sweetie.
First-timers only get one night.

156
00:11:07,465 --> 00:11:09,763
You'll be back on the street selling
in no time.

157
00:11:09,834 --> 00:11:13,361
But I'm not a prostitute.
I was just brushing my teeth.

158
00:11:18,343 --> 00:11:20,140
I like your tights.

159
00:11:21,713 --> 00:11:26,309
And, you know,
you should really go for a more natural look.

160
00:11:26,384 --> 00:11:29,353
All that heavy makeup
just hides your beauty.

161
00:11:29,788 --> 00:11:31,187
I'm a dude.

162
00:11:31,923 --> 00:11:34,585
Oh, well, you're good like that.

163
00:12:18,903 --> 00:12:20,894
So, did you hear
about the pool party at Jordan's?

164
00:12:20,972 --> 00:12:22,599
It was unbelievable.

165
00:12:22,674 --> 00:12:24,005
- Oh, last Saturday?
- Yes.

166
00:12:24,075 --> 00:12:27,238
- Oh, my God. He makes the best margaritas.
- Yep. It's because he uses mangos.

167
00:12:27,312 --> 00:12:29,542
- No. Really?
- He read about them somewhere.

168
00:12:29,614 --> 00:12:30,672
Yeah, mangoritas.

169
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:32,614
- Jordan's just so hot.
- I know.

170
00:12:32,684 --> 00:12:33,742
So are all his friends.

171
00:12:33,818 --> 00:12:36,343
Yeah, seriously,
I've tried to hook up with all of them.

172
00:12:36,421 --> 00:12:39,049
- No, you have not.
- Yes. Yes, I did.

173
00:12:40,191 --> 00:12:41,715
Two of them, I succeeded.

174
00:12:41,793 --> 00:12:43,784
- Really?
- It was amazing.

175
00:12:43,862 --> 00:12:45,295
Who knew?

176
00:12:45,363 --> 00:12:47,422
I was so excited.

177
00:12:54,372 --> 00:12:56,863
Looks like a mini-Playboy Mansion.

178
00:13:11,256 --> 00:13:12,917
- Hi.
- Hi.

179
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:16,818
Hi.

180
00:13:17,829 --> 00:13:19,387
Can I help you?

181
00:13:20,031 --> 00:13:22,465
Yes. I would like to live here, please.

182
00:13:22,534 --> 00:13:26,436
Oh, I know, right?
But you have to be asked to live here.

183
00:13:26,504 --> 00:13:29,837
- Do you go to this school?
- This is a school?

184
00:13:30,775 --> 00:13:32,572
Where are the desks?

185
00:13:33,411 --> 00:13:37,142
No. This is a sorority house at a school.

186
00:13:37,215 --> 00:13:40,275
And you do look like an older,

187
00:13:40,351 --> 00:13:43,252
sluttier version of the type of girl
we would want.

188
00:13:43,321 --> 00:13:47,155
But, I'm sorry, you're not a student.
It was so nice talking to you.

189
00:13:47,225 --> 00:13:49,750
- But I really think it's...
- So nice.

190
00:13:52,864 --> 00:13:56,994
And our piano is from Tuscany.
Very high-end.

191
00:13:57,068 --> 00:14:00,003
I believe that every detail of the house

192
00:14:00,071 --> 00:14:02,801
should be a reflection
of the girls who live here.

193
00:14:02,874 --> 00:14:06,139
Hi. Do you ladies go to school here, too?

194
00:14:06,211 --> 00:14:07,838
Not anymore.

195
00:14:08,546 --> 00:14:11,538
We're the housemothers
of the sororities on campus.

196
00:14:11,616 --> 00:14:13,083
That's so dope.

197
00:14:13,151 --> 00:14:15,711
Do you live in the houses with the girls?

198
00:14:15,787 --> 00:14:17,084
Yes.

199
00:14:17,155 --> 00:14:19,123
That's even dopier.

200
00:14:19,858 --> 00:14:21,553
So, what do housemothers do?

201
00:14:21,626 --> 00:14:23,184
We oversee the meal plans,

202
00:14:23,261 --> 00:14:26,719
chaperone the social events,
make sure the girls stay out of trouble.

203
00:14:26,798 --> 00:14:30,393
Oh, my gosh. That's exactly
what I used to do back at the Mansion.

204
00:14:30,468 --> 00:14:31,867
Can I be one, too?

205
00:14:31,936 --> 00:14:36,032
I'm sorry. This is a sorority, not a brothel.

206
00:14:36,107 --> 00:14:38,940
A brothel?
Oh, I'm not looking to make soup.

207
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:40,875
I'm looking to be like you.

208
00:14:40,945 --> 00:14:42,970
I wanna be a housemother.

209
00:14:43,414 --> 00:14:45,245
We have standards.

210
00:14:45,316 --> 00:14:49,719
Standards that you clearly do not meet.
But it was nice to meet you.

211
00:14:50,221 --> 00:14:51,245
But I just want to...

212
00:14:51,322 --> 00:14:52,448
- So nice.
- So nice.

213
00:15:01,866 --> 00:15:05,927
Try Zeta. Their last housemother was
hospitalized with hallucinations.

214
00:15:06,004 --> 00:15:07,301
Awesome.

215
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,305
Awesome.

216
00:15:25,123 --> 00:15:26,317
Hello?

217
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:37,362
Dean Simmons. Please, please.
We are trying so hard. I promise you.

218
00:15:37,936 --> 00:15:40,097
This seems really unfair.
And I'm not gonna attack you.

219
00:15:40,171 --> 00:15:42,935
I don't want you to feel attacked by all of us,
so I'm just gonna say "me."

220
00:15:43,007 --> 00:15:45,703
To me, this feels really unfair.

221
00:15:45,777 --> 00:15:49,235
Natalie. Look, I feel the same way you do.

222
00:15:49,314 --> 00:15:50,440
But the fact remains,

223
00:15:50,515 --> 00:15:54,144
you guys have not met your requirements
for three years running now.

224
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:57,279
And I'm under a lot of pressure
from other sororities

225
00:15:57,388 --> 00:15:59,549
complaining that we're bending
the rules for you.

226
00:15:59,624 --> 00:16:02,991
By "other sororities,"
do you happen to mean Phi lota Mu?

227
00:16:03,061 --> 00:16:06,224
I really don't think
it matters who complained.

228
00:16:06,297 --> 00:16:09,164
Natalie, rules are rules.

229
00:16:14,072 --> 00:16:15,562
Drama queen.

230
00:16:16,174 --> 00:16:18,267
Oh, I'm sorry I scared you.

231
00:16:18,343 --> 00:16:20,743
Do you think you could help me
out of here, though?

232
00:16:20,812 --> 00:16:22,336
What? Yeah.

233
00:16:23,281 --> 00:16:24,305
Thanks.

234
00:16:24,382 --> 00:16:26,577
I'm so sorry, I think I broke your Z.

235
00:16:26,651 --> 00:16:30,451
Oh. No, it's okay.
It falls off, like, every time we open the door.

236
00:16:30,521 --> 00:16:33,183
Well, at least you still have T and A.

237
00:16:33,691 --> 00:16:35,818
T and an A. Who are you?

238
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:42,756
My name is Shelley,
and I'm here to be your housemother.

239
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:47,838
Well, it's nice to meet you, Shelley.

240
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:50,841
But, unfortunately, he...

241
00:16:52,877 --> 00:16:54,674
It's a little too late.

242
00:16:54,746 --> 00:16:58,409
We're about to lose our charter,
so if we don't have a house,

243
00:16:58,483 --> 00:17:00,644
we won't really be needing a housemother.

244
00:17:01,552 --> 00:17:04,578
Well, why are they gonna
take your house away?

245
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:10,887
Because we get no pledges,
and everyone kind of thinks we're losers.

246
00:17:11,362 --> 00:17:15,389
That's so sad.
Why does everyone else get all the pledges?

247
00:17:15,466 --> 00:17:18,196
Well, they have great parties, and

248
00:17:18,703 --> 00:17:21,433
boys actually like them.

249
00:17:22,774 --> 00:17:25,675
I'm an expert at parties and boys.
I'm a Bunny.

250
00:17:25,743 --> 00:17:28,211
Men write to me from prison,
sometimes in their own blood.

251
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:30,144
I mean, I assume it's theirs, who knows?
I don't.

252
00:17:30,214 --> 00:17:31,340
I'm sorry, I'm nervous right now,

253
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:34,180
because I really wanna help you guys,
because I know I can do it.

254
00:17:34,252 --> 00:17:36,345
Wow, a Bunny?

255
00:17:36,721 --> 00:17:38,586
Like a centerfold?

256
00:17:38,656 --> 00:17:43,719
Oh, bless your heart, no.
Just a couple of small pictorials,

257
00:17:43,795 --> 00:17:48,061
"Girls of the Midwest," "Girls with GEDs,"
"Girls of Charlie Sheen."

258
00:17:48,933 --> 00:17:51,197
But now I'm a homeless person.

259
00:17:52,303 --> 00:17:54,100
God, I'm so sorry.

260
00:17:54,772 --> 00:17:55,932
Good luck.

261
00:17:56,007 --> 00:17:58,635
Wait, but I can really help you guys.

262
00:18:00,611 --> 00:18:02,579
So if we don't get pledges,
we lose our charter?

263
00:18:02,647 --> 00:18:05,741
- We need 30.
- Thirty pledges? There's seven of us, dude.

264
00:18:05,817 --> 00:18:08,217
<i>Technically, 71l2 now.</i>

265
00:18:08,286 --> 00:18:09,412
Hey!

266
00:18:09,487 --> 00:18:12,820
Oh, nothing a little fertilizer can't help.

267
00:18:14,692 --> 00:18:17,525
Not you, Tanya.
I was talking about Harmony.

268
00:18:17,595 --> 00:18:20,689
Actually, 7 3/4 as of Tuesday last week.

269
00:18:21,432 --> 00:18:23,525
Guys, we're never gonna get
that many pledges.

270
00:18:23,601 --> 00:18:26,764
This is just their way of shutting us down.

271
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:29,306
This is awful.

272
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:31,399
Hey, Joanne, just FYI,

273
00:18:31,476 --> 00:18:34,639
you've got refrigerator magnets
stuck to your brace again.

274
00:18:34,712 --> 00:18:36,043
Actually, we need that.
That's our grocery list.

275
00:18:36,114 --> 00:18:38,241
I knew that. I knew that.

276
00:18:38,316 --> 00:18:40,614
- No, you didn't.
- Did so.

277
00:18:41,152 --> 00:18:43,882
- Why do we need knee-highs?
- Oh, my God.

278
00:18:45,556 --> 00:18:48,218
Oh, my God. There's boys on our lawn.

279
00:18:50,628 --> 00:18:52,220
Are they lost?

280
00:18:52,296 --> 00:18:53,388
Nice.

281
00:18:54,132 --> 00:18:57,465
The Leaning Panther. I like that. Yoga's hot.

282
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:00,599
So, are you a Zeta?

283
00:19:01,172 --> 00:19:03,140
Oh, I wish.

284
00:19:03,975 --> 00:19:09,038
Yeah, I do, too, because
Zeta would be my new favorite hizzety-hang.

285
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:12,011
Well, she is not a Zeta,

286
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:15,717
because she's our new
hizzety-housemother.

287
00:19:16,654 --> 00:19:19,020
She'll be hizzy-tizzies...

288
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:21,285
She'll be here all the time.

289
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,855
You're hiring me?

290
00:19:24,362 --> 00:19:26,353
Oh, give me some of that.

291
00:19:27,331 --> 00:19:29,094
Oh, God bless her.

292
00:19:29,834 --> 00:19:32,462
- Why are they acting like that?
- Yes.

293
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:37,135
Oh, that's boys just being boys.

294
00:19:37,842 --> 00:19:39,400
Thank goodness.

295
00:19:44,882 --> 00:19:49,285
Oh, my gosh! I am just so happy
that you guys want me here.

296
00:19:49,353 --> 00:19:51,344
You are not gonna be sorry.

297
00:19:51,422 --> 00:19:53,822
So this is how we're gonna get pledges?

298
00:19:53,891 --> 00:19:58,089
Hiring an archaically superficial reflection
of the male fantasy?

299
00:19:58,162 --> 00:20:00,392
Well, guys like her.

300
00:20:00,498 --> 00:20:05,435
And since guys don't like us,
I figured she could help.

301
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:10,531
So, in order to be in a sisterhood,
now we have to be popular?

302
00:20:10,608 --> 00:20:15,238
No, no. In order to keep our house,
though, we do have to be popular. Yes.

303
00:20:15,346 --> 00:20:18,509
So, I figured Shelley here could
teach us how.

304
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:21,609
Okay, look, don't get me wrong. I love guys.

305
00:20:21,719 --> 00:20:24,552
But I lived in a house filled with girls
for nine years,

306
00:20:24,622 --> 00:20:29,525
and I know that there's nothing better
than just being with your sisters,

307
00:20:29,594 --> 00:20:33,963
sharing, talking all night,
painting each other's bodies,

308
00:20:34,765 --> 00:20:38,223
baking penis cookies,
playing with monkeys...

309
00:20:39,003 --> 00:20:41,836
- Where'd you live?
- The Playboy Mansion.

310
00:20:48,146 --> 00:20:51,673
No, that doesn't make her a hooker. Sorry.

311
00:20:56,554 --> 00:20:59,114
She's shy. She's just...

312
00:20:59,323 --> 00:21:03,157
She's so shy. That's Lilly, also, by the way.

313
00:21:03,227 --> 00:21:04,387
Lilly.

314
00:21:05,963 --> 00:21:08,864
And this here is Harmony.

315
00:21:08,933 --> 00:21:10,230
Harmony.

316
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:15,332
And Carrie Mae.

317
00:21:15,406 --> 00:21:16,873
Carrie Mae.

318
00:21:16,941 --> 00:21:19,705
And then Joanne, over there.

319
00:21:19,777 --> 00:21:21,108
Joanne.

320
00:21:22,413 --> 00:21:25,871
Wow, you hired the Exorcist. That's great.

321
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:27,542
What is that?

322
00:21:27,618 --> 00:21:30,086
Is that like a Yoda thing, or what?

323
00:21:30,688 --> 00:21:32,713
It's fun, but, what...

324
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:37,250
Oh, no, no. It's just this thing I do
to remember people's names.

325
00:21:37,328 --> 00:21:38,352
Natalie.

326
00:21:38,429 --> 00:21:42,456
So, thank you guys so much
for letting me be your housemother.

327
00:21:43,301 --> 00:21:45,132
No, it's no problem.

328
00:21:46,938 --> 00:21:48,701
Because you just...

329
00:21:49,473 --> 00:21:51,270
This is just gonna be great.

330
00:21:51,342 --> 00:21:52,434
But I have to go take a shower,

331
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:55,775
because I haven't had one since
I slept in my car and spent the night in jail.

332
00:21:55,846 --> 00:21:57,006
Sweet.

333
00:21:59,317 --> 00:22:01,649
- Hi, girls.
- Oh, my God!

334
00:22:01,719 --> 00:22:03,949
Shelley! Hi. Where's your robe?

335
00:22:04,021 --> 00:22:05,682
Oh, I just like to air dry.

336
00:22:05,756 --> 00:22:07,917
Oh, she just likes to air dry.

337
00:22:07,992 --> 00:22:09,926
My God, you're so vapid.

338
00:22:09,994 --> 00:22:11,791
Oh, my gosh. Thank you so much.

339
00:22:11,862 --> 00:22:14,763
You're like the hundredth person
who's told me that.

340
00:22:14,832 --> 00:22:19,064
Shell? Just a quick little side note,

341
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:20,569
I don't think that some
of the girls in this house

342
00:22:20,638 --> 00:22:22,538
have even seen their own bodies naked,

343
00:22:22,607 --> 00:22:26,976
so they probably don't really want
to see your perfectly engineered boobs.

344
00:22:27,044 --> 00:22:31,743
Well, I'm just walking around
in the body God and Dr. Borkman gave me.

345
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,879
Hey, Shelley, why don't you throw
some clothes on?

346
00:22:37,955 --> 00:22:40,287
We've got a lot of work to do.

347
00:22:41,025 --> 00:22:44,153
This year, we are gonna get
lots and lots of pledges.

348
00:22:44,228 --> 00:22:45,490
Okay.

349
00:22:45,563 --> 00:22:48,964
Oh, we also need to raise money
for our philanthropy.

350
00:22:49,033 --> 00:22:50,933
What's a phila-canopee?

351
00:22:51,602 --> 00:22:54,696
Oh, no. It's a philanthropy.

352
00:22:55,406 --> 00:22:56,498
It's like a charity.

353
00:22:56,574 --> 00:22:59,202
Oh, I love charity.

354
00:22:59,277 --> 00:23:00,266
One time, at the Mansion,

355
00:23:00,344 --> 00:23:03,905
I even let Bob Saget grind on me
during a slow dance.

356
00:23:07,051 --> 00:23:09,542
And here's a list of ideas
I came up with for fundraisers

357
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:11,884
that might make us a little more popular.

358
00:23:11,956 --> 00:23:16,154
So, please take a read.

359
00:23:16,227 --> 00:23:18,457
"Start a beekeeping club."

360
00:23:18,529 --> 00:23:20,759
We could have the masks, even.

361
00:23:22,833 --> 00:23:25,165
"Paleolithic bake sale."

362
00:23:25,269 --> 00:23:28,705
<i>Hi! Dinosaurs!
Like, everyone saw Jurassic Park.</i>

363
00:23:30,341 --> 00:23:32,138
"B.Y.O.M."

364
00:23:32,209 --> 00:23:33,437
Bring your own man?

365
00:23:33,511 --> 00:23:36,036
No. Bring your own mouse!

366
00:23:36,947 --> 00:23:38,141
Which is better.

367
00:23:38,215 --> 00:23:40,706
Because they're cute and they're little
and you can hold them.

368
00:23:40,785 --> 00:23:45,449
And also, another thing that
I thought of was, you could dress them up.

369
00:23:45,523 --> 00:23:48,424
It's the whole fun part of it,
is you can put them in little outfits.

370
00:23:48,492 --> 00:23:50,926
You can make, like,
an Abraham Lincoln mouse.

371
00:23:50,995 --> 00:23:53,190
And you could do like Joan of...

372
00:23:53,264 --> 00:23:56,529
Why do everyone's eyes glaze over
when I talk about this?

373
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,227
Whoa. No.

374
00:23:58,302 --> 00:24:01,829
No, they weren't glazing.
They were just taking a break.

375
00:24:02,573 --> 00:24:05,633
Natalie, these are super, super-great ideas.

376
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:08,178
Thank you. I worked really hard.

377
00:24:08,245 --> 00:24:11,646
But we might wanna try
something a little more

378
00:24:12,149 --> 00:24:13,207
sexy.

379
00:24:14,752 --> 00:24:18,347
Car wash. Come get your car washed.

380
00:24:18,923 --> 00:24:22,051
Here we are at the Zeta House Car Wash.

381
00:24:22,126 --> 00:24:25,095
I have a car, and I'm great at washing it.

382
00:24:26,597 --> 00:24:28,690
I am so offended right now.

383
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,291
Come on, guys, let's give her a chance.

384
00:24:31,369 --> 00:24:33,735
- Car wash.
- Car wash!

385
00:24:33,804 --> 00:24:35,897
You said you needed to raise money.

386
00:24:35,973 --> 00:24:41,240
Well, washing cars is a fun and sexy way
to make all the money that we need.

387
00:24:41,979 --> 00:24:44,709
So, car wash!

388
00:24:45,583 --> 00:24:46,982
Car wash.

389
00:24:47,985 --> 00:24:50,078
We're having a car wash.

390
00:24:50,154 --> 00:24:51,416
Car wash.

391
00:24:51,989 --> 00:24:54,719
No, I can't bend that way.

392
00:24:54,792 --> 00:24:56,692
Hey, watch this, guys.

393
00:25:02,566 --> 00:25:03,726
Hi, guys.

394
00:25:03,801 --> 00:25:04,995
Dude, that's wild.

395
00:25:05,069 --> 00:25:07,333
Oh, my God. Shelley, that's Colby.
I'm in love with him.

396
00:25:07,405 --> 00:25:11,171
Oh, that's so sweet.
How long have you guys been going out?

397
00:25:11,942 --> 00:25:15,776
No. We are not going out.
I've never even talked to him.

398
00:25:16,647 --> 00:25:18,444
And he's coming this way. What do I do?

399
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:19,778
Do sexy.

400
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:24,952
Wash these cars, you sexy bitches!

401
00:25:25,022 --> 00:25:27,752
They are filthy. And so are you!

402
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,550
Did she just call us bitches?

403
00:25:30,628 --> 00:25:32,425
Did she just call us sexy?

404
00:25:32,496 --> 00:25:34,794
Wash! Wash! Wash!

405
00:25:34,865 --> 00:25:37,959
Wash! Wash! Wash! Wash!

406
00:25:40,671 --> 00:25:42,263
- Hey, girls.
- Hi.

407
00:25:43,107 --> 00:25:46,235
Okay, that's the first time
we've ever spoken, so... First time.

408
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:47,402
Hi!

409
00:25:48,045 --> 00:25:51,981
We're just washing cars and being sexy.

410
00:25:52,049 --> 00:25:53,038
Mostly sexy.

411
00:25:53,117 --> 00:25:56,109
So, does anybody want a wet T-shirt?

412
00:25:57,054 --> 00:26:00,615
- Yeah.
- Or, you know, maybe some wet pants.

413
00:26:05,396 --> 00:26:08,524
Someone went accident in her sexy pants.

414
00:26:08,599 --> 00:26:12,194
So, anyway, we're having some drinks
over at Theta later.

415
00:26:12,269 --> 00:26:14,169
- Theta.
- Totally.

416
00:26:14,238 --> 00:26:16,297
You wanna come over?

417
00:26:16,373 --> 00:26:17,533
Yes.

418
00:26:18,042 --> 00:26:21,307
Well, we are a little thirsty.

419
00:26:21,378 --> 00:26:23,710
Maybe you guys are, too.

420
00:26:23,781 --> 00:26:26,875
Why don't you have a drink right now?

421
00:26:26,951 --> 00:26:29,044
I'll take a little sip.

422
00:26:33,791 --> 00:26:35,315
I am so sorry.

423
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:40,021
Thought I'd help you wash the testosterone
off your face, Colby.

424
00:26:40,097 --> 00:26:41,621
Well, cool.

425
00:26:41,699 --> 00:26:45,567
So, what time can we drop by for drinks?

426
00:26:46,971 --> 00:26:48,939
Now that you mention it,

427
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,335
the guest list is looking pretty full.

428
00:26:51,408 --> 00:26:53,842
So, maybe next time, all right?

429
00:26:53,911 --> 00:26:55,469
Hey, Super-brace!

430
00:26:55,546 --> 00:26:58,344
Oil can. Oil can.

431
00:26:58,415 --> 00:27:01,782
Not cool, man. Let's go.
Come on, come on, let's go.

432
00:27:03,254 --> 00:27:05,722
Well, I think we're done here, sexy bitches.

433
00:27:05,789 --> 00:27:07,848
Thanks a lot, Mona.

434
00:27:07,925 --> 00:27:10,553
The one chance I get to talk to Colby,
and you completely ruin it.

435
00:27:10,628 --> 00:27:12,289
Yeah, because the whole
peeing-in-your-pants thing

436
00:27:12,363 --> 00:27:14,024
was really working out well for you.

437
00:27:14,098 --> 00:27:15,531
Thank you.

438
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:19,194
My car's still dirty,
so I'll be out here if you need me.

439
00:27:22,239 --> 00:27:24,298
Do you want a car wash?

440
00:27:26,076 --> 00:27:27,373
Me?

441
00:27:27,444 --> 00:27:30,038
Oh, no. No. I have a bike.

442
00:27:30,114 --> 00:27:32,309
Besides, I gotta get back to work.

443
00:27:32,383 --> 00:27:34,749
Oh, yeah. I know all about work.

444
00:27:35,286 --> 00:27:37,686
I'm at work right now, actually.

445
00:27:37,755 --> 00:27:39,916
Oh, do you wash cars?

446
00:27:40,024 --> 00:27:42,652
No. I'm the Zeta Sorority Housemother.

447
00:27:43,294 --> 00:27:45,956
You seem a little young
to be a housemother.

448
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:47,258
Really?

449
00:27:48,165 --> 00:27:50,326
You think I'm young?

450
00:27:50,401 --> 00:27:52,494
Oh, thank you.

451
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:54,094
Thank you.

452
00:27:54,171 --> 00:27:57,868
I'm sorry to invade your space,
but I needed that.

453
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:01,805
So, what's your job?

454
00:28:01,879 --> 00:28:03,904
Oh... Job.

455
00:28:04,715 --> 00:28:07,775
I manage a nursing home.

456
00:28:09,753 --> 00:28:12,847
It's so great you give nurses a place to live.

457
00:28:13,624 --> 00:28:16,787
Actually, it's a nursing home
for senior citizens.

458
00:28:17,194 --> 00:28:20,027
An old folks'... Old people. Old people.

459
00:28:20,631 --> 00:28:22,462
I know lots of old men.

460
00:28:22,533 --> 00:28:26,526
Hairy and not hairy.
But I don't mean to brag.

461
00:28:27,171 --> 00:28:29,002
So, they live there?

462
00:28:30,074 --> 00:28:32,065
Like an orphanage for old people?

463
00:28:32,142 --> 00:28:35,976
Well, yeah. I mean, that's one way
you could look at it. Yeah.

464
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:39,476
Their parents are gone,
and they live in a big building

465
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:41,780
all by themselves,
wondering where everybody went,

466
00:28:41,852 --> 00:28:43,979
and I think I'm gonna cry.

467
00:28:45,322 --> 00:28:50,350
Listen, if you want, you know,
you could stop by the nursing home,

468
00:28:50,427 --> 00:28:53,362
because we always need
volunteers to help out

469
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:55,489
and visit with the old people,

470
00:28:55,566 --> 00:28:57,124
if you're interested.

471
00:28:57,201 --> 00:29:00,102
Yeah. I'd love to.

472
00:29:02,139 --> 00:29:06,075
My name is Shelley.
And I like long walks and hate rude people.

473
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:10,004
Oh, that's good to know. I'm Oliver.

474
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,378
- Oliver.
- Yes.

475
00:29:12,449 --> 00:29:16,818
I like taking long walks with rude people.
Only on short piers, though.

476
00:29:21,525 --> 00:29:23,117
That's funny.

477
00:29:23,193 --> 00:29:25,093
- You're funny.
- Thank you.

478
00:29:25,162 --> 00:29:26,595
- Bye.
- Bye.

479
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,426
Guys.

480
00:29:32,503 --> 00:29:34,562
Okay, this isn't my fault. Don't like...

481
00:29:34,638 --> 00:29:36,572
I know it was a disaster, but she's...

482
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,905
You guys, I just had the best idea
for our phila-tropy.

483
00:29:39,977 --> 00:29:41,308
Philanthropy.

484
00:29:41,378 --> 00:29:44,506
We are gonna volunteer
at Oliver's nursing home.

485
00:29:44,581 --> 00:29:46,242
Who is Oliver?

486
00:29:46,316 --> 00:29:49,376
He's this guy I just met. He's really sweet.

487
00:29:49,453 --> 00:29:50,818
And he's kind of cute, too.

488
00:29:51,989 --> 00:29:53,388
Well...

489
00:29:53,457 --> 00:29:58,258
I don't know if you guys can recognize this,
but Shelley is meeting guys.

490
00:29:58,328 --> 00:30:01,092
And if she knows how to meet guys,
then we will learn how to meet guys.

491
00:30:01,165 --> 00:30:05,158
Then more girls'll wanna hang out with us.
Hence, more pledges.

492
00:30:05,736 --> 00:30:07,328
Yeah. Hence!

493
00:30:07,404 --> 00:30:09,133
Okay, here's what we need to do.

494
00:30:09,206 --> 00:30:12,642
We need to get all dressed up,
and then we need to go to a club

495
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:16,237
and drink fruity drinks
and dirty-dance with each other.

496
00:30:16,313 --> 00:30:20,010
- Why?
- To bond, y'old grumpy.

497
00:30:20,451 --> 00:30:23,011
Yeah, y'old grumpy. To bond.

498
00:30:23,087 --> 00:30:26,284
The music's playing.
Our bodies are swaying.

499
00:30:26,356 --> 00:30:27,755
You know what I'm saying?

500
00:30:27,825 --> 00:30:31,693
You know? We could like play
some form of dodge ball, maybe.

501
00:30:34,298 --> 00:30:37,267
We could tie our shoes together,
our tennis shoes,

502
00:30:37,334 --> 00:30:39,962
and we could throw them
over telephone wires.

503
00:30:40,037 --> 00:30:41,095
Because I see that everywhere,

504
00:30:41,171 --> 00:30:43,731
and it seems like people would
have fun doing that.

505
00:30:43,807 --> 00:30:45,832
Like, "How hard can you throw?"

506
00:30:45,909 --> 00:30:49,140
You know what I mean? Like how...
What are you...

507
00:30:52,382 --> 00:30:54,509
Or we could go to a club.

508
00:31:08,699 --> 00:31:12,066
Six Virgin Marys and one Kamikaze.

509
00:31:12,136 --> 00:31:15,867
Here's to Zetas,
to making you guys the best sorority ever.

510
00:31:18,642 --> 00:31:21,543
Oh, Mona, that guy is totally
checking you out.

511
00:31:21,612 --> 00:31:24,513
- Go flirt with him.
- Right.

512
00:31:24,581 --> 00:31:27,243
Think of it as research, Mona. Research.

513
00:31:27,317 --> 00:31:29,308
Get over there. Get on that horse!

514
00:31:29,386 --> 00:31:31,513
Go, go. Go!

515
00:31:35,859 --> 00:31:37,190
You like what you see, stud?

516
00:31:37,261 --> 00:31:40,025
I'm not really sure
what I'm looking at, metalface.

517
00:31:40,097 --> 00:31:42,588
Let me guess, is it a Hannibal Lecter thing?

518
00:31:42,666 --> 00:31:44,099
Yeah, it is.

519
00:31:50,374 --> 00:31:52,968
There's a big box of cutesicles.

520
00:31:53,043 --> 00:31:54,738
Carrie Mae, go work your magic.

521
00:31:54,812 --> 00:31:56,939
The only magic I've ever done
was try to figure out a way

522
00:31:57,014 --> 00:32:01,144
to stay in college for nine years
and not go back to my trailer park in Idaho.

523
00:32:01,218 --> 00:32:04,119
So, figure out a way into his heart.

524
00:32:04,188 --> 00:32:08,022
Just go over there
and talk to him about any old thing.

525
00:32:12,296 --> 00:32:14,764
Excuse me, you know where the crapper is?

526
00:32:14,832 --> 00:32:17,426
I have to drop off some timber.

527
00:32:19,269 --> 00:32:20,736
Go away.

528
00:32:22,072 --> 00:32:23,937
What'd I do?

529
00:32:24,007 --> 00:32:26,441
It's okay. It's just, Carrie Mae, sometimes

530
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:30,344
men like their women
with a little bit of mystery.

531
00:32:30,447 --> 00:32:33,382
So, get back over there and try it again.

532
00:32:38,288 --> 00:32:39,721
Excuse me.

533
00:32:40,457 --> 00:32:41,924
You know where the crapper is?

534
00:32:41,992 --> 00:32:45,018
I have to do a very mysterious thing
in there.

535
00:32:45,562 --> 00:32:47,530
Drop off some timber.

536
00:32:48,932 --> 00:32:51,765
I'm definitely not drunk enough for that.

537
00:32:55,505 --> 00:32:58,872
Well, this is good, though.

538
00:32:58,942 --> 00:33:01,137
This is really good practice.

539
00:33:01,745 --> 00:33:03,212
Hey, it's the Zetas.

540
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,542
- Hi.
- Hi.

541
00:33:04,615 --> 00:33:06,276
I feel like we never see you guys out.

542
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:08,841
We never see them out, either.

543
00:33:08,919 --> 00:33:11,649
I met you yesterday.
I was that homeless girl.

544
00:33:11,722 --> 00:33:13,189
Now I'm their house mom.

545
00:33:13,257 --> 00:33:15,919
Congratulations. That's awesome.

546
00:33:15,993 --> 00:33:18,757
So, hey, you guys got here just in time.

547
00:33:18,829 --> 00:33:23,061
We're doing a little karaoke contest.
Sororities versus fraternities.

548
00:33:23,133 --> 00:33:25,624
Yeah, you guys can go next if you want.

549
00:33:25,702 --> 00:33:27,192
Yeah! Come on!

550
00:33:27,271 --> 00:33:31,037
Oh, girls! Always say "yes" to karaoke.

551
00:33:31,708 --> 00:33:33,539
Yeah, we'll pick a great song for you.

552
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:35,771
Don't worry,
you can't be any worse than we were.

553
00:33:35,846 --> 00:33:38,007
- Seriously, we were wretched.
- Awful.

554
00:33:38,081 --> 00:33:39,981
- I don't know.
- Oh, okay. Okay, listen.

555
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:43,986
Just give me a second.
I promise the Zetas are going up on stage.

556
00:33:44,054 --> 00:33:45,612
Awesome. Great.

557
00:33:46,356 --> 00:33:48,950
You guys, karaoke is so fun!

558
00:33:49,026 --> 00:33:52,427
You gotta get up there and do karaoke.
Boys like singing. It's sexy.

559
00:33:52,496 --> 00:33:56,227
Go! Go! Get up there! Go! Go!

560
00:33:57,334 --> 00:33:58,961
I think we can do it.

561
00:33:59,036 --> 00:34:01,300
We can do anything better
than those mannequins, you guys.

562
00:34:01,371 --> 00:34:03,339
I might puke, but let's do it!

563
00:34:03,407 --> 00:34:05,170
That's the spirit!

564
00:34:06,176 --> 00:34:09,907
All right! Get up there, you Bravehearts!

565
00:34:13,884 --> 00:34:16,478
<i>All right, that was Kappa Eta Sigma!</i>

566
00:34:21,191 --> 00:34:23,921
<i>Next up, the Zetas?</i>

567
00:34:25,262 --> 00:34:27,628
<i>Singing Like A Virgin.</i>

568
00:34:35,439 --> 00:34:38,431
<i>I made it through the wilderness</i>

569
00:34:39,076 --> 00:34:42,341
<i>Somehow I made it through</i>

570
00:34:44,314 --> 00:34:49,445
<i>Didn't know how lost I was
Until I found you</i>

571
00:34:51,154 --> 00:34:54,885
<i>I was beat, incomplete</i>

572
00:34:54,958 --> 00:34:59,486
<i>I'm a hag and I'm fat and rude</i>

573
00:34:59,563 --> 00:35:02,327
<i>But you made me feel</i>

574
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,135
<i>Yeah, you made me feel</i>

575
00:35:06,203 --> 00:35:10,833
<i>Like a big bag of poop</i>

576
00:35:11,274 --> 00:35:13,242
<i>Like a loser</i>

577
00:35:14,611 --> 00:35:18,172
<i>We're rejected all the time</i>

578
00:35:19,316 --> 00:35:23,082
<i>Like a loser</i>

579
00:35:23,153 --> 00:35:27,089
<i>Who's so retarded, it's a crime</i>

580
00:35:27,157 --> 00:35:28,954
<i>Like a...</i>

581
00:35:38,935 --> 00:35:40,800
That was not nice.

582
00:35:41,738 --> 00:35:43,000
Awesome.

583
00:35:43,073 --> 00:35:45,064
You wanna get cut, bitch?

584
00:35:45,142 --> 00:35:48,077
Oh, classy. Very classy.

585
00:35:48,145 --> 00:35:52,241
No, no, no, no, she's right, Courtney.
I mean, we should apologize.

586
00:35:52,315 --> 00:35:54,215
Especially since we're
about to take their house.

587
00:35:54,284 --> 00:35:56,844
- Oh, right.
- Where are you taking it?

588
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:59,582
Well, we heard that you were
losing your charter,

589
00:35:59,656 --> 00:36:03,922
so Phi lota Mu is gonna buy your crappy
house when it goes on sale after rush.

590
00:36:03,994 --> 00:36:08,397
Yes, we are going to have so many pledges,
we'll need all of the extra space.

591
00:36:08,465 --> 00:36:09,864
Oh, but don't worry.

592
00:36:09,933 --> 00:36:13,061
I mean, we'll still let you guys stay on
and be the maids.

593
00:36:13,136 --> 00:36:16,867
You can sweep the chimney.
Won't that be nice?

594
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,805
Does the little one understand human talk?

595
00:36:18,875 --> 00:36:21,742
Oh, and I guess
that when we buy your house,

596
00:36:21,812 --> 00:36:23,712
you'll go back to being homeless.

597
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:24,974
I'm a housemother.

598
00:36:25,048 --> 00:36:28,540
A Zeta housemother, and I don't like
some of the things you were saying.

599
00:36:28,618 --> 00:36:32,054
Because they do understand human talk,
and you hurt their feelings.

600
00:36:32,122 --> 00:36:34,113
Oh, Shelley, come on.
It's not worth it, let's go.

601
00:36:34,191 --> 00:36:35,658
Yeah, you should go.

602
00:36:35,725 --> 00:36:37,056
It was so nice to see you.

603
00:36:37,127 --> 00:36:38,116
But I really think that...

604
00:36:38,195 --> 00:36:39,355
- So nice.
- So nice.

605
00:36:41,031 --> 00:36:43,591
That was so humiliating, you guys.

606
00:36:43,667 --> 00:36:44,861
I know it was awful.

607
00:36:44,935 --> 00:36:47,529
And I am so mad
that they did that to you guys,

608
00:36:47,604 --> 00:36:51,005
but we can't listen to those girls.

609
00:36:51,074 --> 00:36:53,975
Why? They're right. We are losers.

610
00:36:54,044 --> 00:36:56,035
Oh, we're not losers.

611
00:36:56,646 --> 00:36:59,012
You just ignore that dumb old wall.

612
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:04,211
Well, you're not a loser, Shelley.
People like you. You're pretty.

613
00:37:04,287 --> 00:37:07,279
I just don't understand
that kind of behavior.

614
00:37:07,991 --> 00:37:09,390
Trust me.

615
00:37:09,459 --> 00:37:13,896
You guys, I can make you way hotter
than any old Phi lota Mu.

616
00:37:14,764 --> 00:37:19,133
By the time I'm done,
every girl on campus'll want to pledge Zeta.

617
00:37:19,202 --> 00:37:22,103
No, really, we are just a bunch of misfits.

618
00:37:23,607 --> 00:37:27,566
Lilly just texted me from the closet.
She says we're not misfits.

619
00:37:27,644 --> 00:37:29,236
Well, I hope she was being ironic.

620
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,147
Go, go, go, go, go!

621
00:37:32,215 --> 00:37:33,375
- Are we doing this?
- Do it!

622
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:35,077
- All right.
- Here.

623
00:37:35,152 --> 00:37:37,017
You can do this.

624
00:37:37,087 --> 00:37:41,080
If I thought you all were quitting...
My heart would just fall out of my head.

625
00:37:41,158 --> 00:37:43,490
Shelley, your heart is not in your head.

626
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:47,155
Your heart has its own cavity.
Right under your fake boobs.

627
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:48,857
Do you understand how moronic you sound

628
00:37:48,932 --> 00:37:51,924
when you say
your heart is gonna fall out of your head?

629
00:37:52,002 --> 00:37:53,492
Well, Mona,

630
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:58,131
I totally understand
why that saying sounds mixed-up,

631
00:37:58,208 --> 00:38:00,472
but I don't mean it for real.

632
00:38:00,544 --> 00:38:03,911
I don't think that my heart is in my skull.

633
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:08,974
What I mean is that sometimes
logic tells you to do something,

634
00:38:09,052 --> 00:38:12,510
but you have to have part
of your heart in it as well.

635
00:38:12,989 --> 00:38:18,086
My head and my heart tell me
that we can save Zeta.

636
00:38:19,262 --> 00:38:24,131
We need 30 pledges,
and I know just how to do it.

637
00:38:25,035 --> 00:38:28,493
By making you guys
the hottest girls on campus.

638
00:38:34,277 --> 00:38:35,710
I'll get it.

639
00:38:40,884 --> 00:38:43,045
- Does that say "Zeta"?
- Yeah.

640
00:38:44,988 --> 00:38:47,388
This is war.

641
00:38:47,457 --> 00:38:49,049
Enough is enough.

642
00:38:49,125 --> 00:38:52,322
Let's do this. There's no way
those bitches are getting our house.

643
00:39:06,076 --> 00:39:09,568
Okay, ladies,
dressing sexy is all about skimplifying.

644
00:39:09,646 --> 00:39:12,945
I want you to show skin
in the four major regions.

645
00:39:13,016 --> 00:39:16,179
Arms, legs, belly and cleavage.

646
00:39:16,253 --> 00:39:17,618
Is this how you skimplify?

647
00:39:17,687 --> 00:39:21,384
Oh, okay. Well, maybe we could let
someone who doesn't have a giant baby

648
00:39:21,458 --> 00:39:23,187
in their belly give it a try.

649
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:27,822
Okay, this is your most important
secret weapon, the water bra.

650
00:39:27,897 --> 00:39:29,956
Just stay away from sharp corners.

651
00:39:30,033 --> 00:39:31,967
This is going too far.

652
00:39:32,469 --> 00:39:34,300
No. No way. No.

653
00:39:35,238 --> 00:39:38,401
Just consider it like another thesis topic,
you know?

654
00:39:38,475 --> 00:39:41,911
"Conventional Archetypes of Beauty
and Their Effect on the Opposite Sex."

655
00:39:48,852 --> 00:39:50,080
Are you sure that's everything?

656
00:39:50,153 --> 00:39:54,852
Because feeling good on the inside
is all about looking good on the outside.

657
00:40:00,196 --> 00:40:02,426
Go ahead and keep that one.

658
00:40:02,499 --> 00:40:05,593
There are three rules to successful flirtation.

659
00:40:05,669 --> 00:40:09,070
Eye contact, flattery and lots of touching.

660
00:40:09,139 --> 00:40:12,370
For example,
let's pretend that Natalie here is a man.

661
00:40:12,442 --> 00:40:16,310
I'm touching his arm,
I'm looking deep into his eyes

662
00:40:16,379 --> 00:40:18,904
and I'm wearing deodorant. Carrie Mae?

663
00:40:18,982 --> 00:40:20,244
I know.

664
00:40:20,317 --> 00:40:22,808
And I might say something like this.

665
00:40:22,886 --> 00:40:26,947
"Oh, my gosh.
Your biceps are huge. Kiss me."

666
00:40:27,524 --> 00:40:31,187
And then he would kiss me.
So, any questions?

667
00:40:31,261 --> 00:40:33,627
What do I do with my chew?

668
00:40:33,697 --> 00:40:35,062
How long would the kiss usually be?

669
00:40:35,131 --> 00:40:38,362
And, also, why would he kiss you,
because you...

670
00:40:42,138 --> 00:40:45,665
Okay, ladies, today's lesson is makeup.

671
00:40:45,742 --> 00:40:48,438
First, we must highlight your eyes.

672
00:40:48,511 --> 00:40:51,378
The eyes are the nipples of the face.

673
00:41:38,628 --> 00:41:40,061
Whoa.

674
00:41:48,738 --> 00:41:49,830
Wow.

675
00:41:50,473 --> 00:41:52,941
So this is what it feels like
to not be invisible.

676
00:41:53,009 --> 00:41:56,638
We weren't exactly invisible before,
just the anti-hot.

677
00:41:58,081 --> 00:41:59,378
Check out Joanne.

678
00:41:59,449 --> 00:42:01,246
I really like what you've done
with the Bedazzler.

679
00:42:01,317 --> 00:42:03,251
- Thank you.
- It's nice.

680
00:42:03,319 --> 00:42:04,411
So what's next, Shelley?

681
00:42:04,487 --> 00:42:07,854
I want all the fraternities to see
how hot you guys are.

682
00:42:07,924 --> 00:42:11,724
Kind of like a coming-out party.
So we are gonna take some pictures.

683
00:42:11,795 --> 00:42:14,127
<i>Oh, we are not posing for Playboy.</i>

684
00:42:14,197 --> 00:42:17,894
No, in a calendar. "The Girls of Zeta."

685
00:42:17,967 --> 00:42:19,662
Everyone will see the new you,

686
00:42:19,736 --> 00:42:23,433
and selling the calendars will help us
raise money for our phil-an-coppopopy.

687
00:42:23,506 --> 00:42:25,633
Hey, you guys, Lilly just texted me.

688
00:42:25,708 --> 00:42:28,404
She says we look hot and this is fun.

689
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:37,779
Keep doing that, keep doing that.
Make love to the camera.

690
00:42:38,488 --> 00:42:41,048
<i>I saw that in Austin Powers.</i>

691
00:42:41,124 --> 00:42:45,959
Yeah, work it. Think really sexy witch.

692
00:42:46,029 --> 00:42:49,556
- Are you a good witch or a bad witch?
- A good witch.

693
00:42:49,632 --> 00:42:51,657
I think you're a bad witch.

694
00:42:51,734 --> 00:42:56,262
I bet the house that falls on you is gonna
be a sexy house.

695
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:59,274
Work it. Work it.

696
00:42:59,342 --> 00:43:03,108
You're like a supermodel,
except more pregnant. Keep going.

697
00:43:21,764 --> 00:43:26,360
Okay, Henry, very glad you finally learned
how to use the suggestion box.

698
00:43:26,436 --> 00:43:28,802
And I want to let you know
that I got your message,

699
00:43:28,872 --> 00:43:30,965
you want less Boggle and more bingo.

700
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,133
So I'm gonna work on it, okay?

701
00:43:33,209 --> 00:43:36,144
Whoa.
Okay, what's going on with your heart?

702
00:43:36,813 --> 00:43:38,610
Shelley, you're here.

703
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:42,381
- Move out of the way, man.
- Move it, Junior.

704
00:43:42,452 --> 00:43:43,851
- Sideways.
- Sorry, sorry.

705
00:43:44,354 --> 00:43:45,685
- Hi.
- Hi.

706
00:43:47,524 --> 00:43:51,051
We brought a donation
as part of our philtrophy.

707
00:43:51,127 --> 00:43:53,459
Oh, great. Thank you.

708
00:43:54,230 --> 00:43:55,595
We're making calendars,

709
00:43:55,665 --> 00:43:57,758
and before we could even get them all out,

710
00:43:57,834 --> 00:44:00,462
the printing-press guys bought up
the first batch.

711
00:44:00,537 --> 00:44:02,562
Wow. Great, thank you very much.

712
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:06,166
This is, "Pay to the Order of Old People."

713
00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:09,444
Yes, and it doesn't stop there.

714
00:44:09,512 --> 00:44:14,347
I hope you don't mind, but I brought a few
extra volunteers to help out today.

715
00:44:16,185 --> 00:44:18,745
Henry, Henry, look away. Look away, okay?

716
00:44:18,821 --> 00:44:23,485
Look at the wall.
Think of broccoli and bad bingo cards.

717
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,721
You know, actually, your timing is perfect,

718
00:44:25,795 --> 00:44:29,492
because I was about to try
and organize a dance class.

719
00:44:29,566 --> 00:44:31,090
Nobody signed up.

720
00:44:31,167 --> 00:44:34,193
And I was at the top of the list
not signing up.

721
00:44:34,270 --> 00:44:37,831
There ain't no way I'm dancing.
You can forget that.

722
00:44:37,907 --> 00:44:40,205
Oh, I love to dance.

723
00:44:40,276 --> 00:44:41,538
Well, let's do it.

724
00:44:44,847 --> 00:44:47,782
Okay, ladies, fan out and find a partner.

725
00:44:50,219 --> 00:44:53,848
And maybe we should talk
about this music.

726
00:44:55,491 --> 00:44:58,483
Wow, this music is super, super-great,

727
00:44:58,561 --> 00:45:02,895
but we might want to try
something a little sexier.

728
00:45:18,181 --> 00:45:19,910
Great job, ladies.

729
00:45:33,863 --> 00:45:37,094
Shelley, I just want to thank you so much
for doing this.

730
00:45:37,166 --> 00:45:38,258
It's just so kind.

731
00:45:38,334 --> 00:45:42,862
Oh, well, kindness is just love
with its work boots on.

732
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:46,365
Hey, Oliver, ask the girl to dance.

733
00:45:47,810 --> 00:45:49,744
- I'd love to.
- Really?

734
00:45:52,315 --> 00:45:54,044
Looking good, Jean.

735
00:45:55,551 --> 00:46:00,079
So, listen, Shelley, I was wondering
if maybe you'd like to have dinner sometime.

736
00:46:00,156 --> 00:46:02,556
Really? Yes. Yeah.

737
00:46:03,026 --> 00:46:04,254
Great.

738
00:46:05,461 --> 00:46:08,328
- Bitchsuck!
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

739
00:46:08,398 --> 00:46:10,127
Oh, it's all good.

740
00:46:13,002 --> 00:46:14,765
I'm so glad to be back.

741
00:46:14,837 --> 00:46:18,796
Marvin, tell Shelley we're back
and we're gonna be watching a movie.

742
00:46:18,875 --> 00:46:20,502
How about something spooky? No, funny.

743
00:46:20,576 --> 00:46:22,771
<i>No. How about Scarface?</i>

744
00:46:22,845 --> 00:46:25,075
No, you guys,
I think it should be Shelley's pick tonight.

745
00:46:25,148 --> 00:46:29,847
Mr. Hefner, Shelley's actually gone.
She told me to give you this letter.

746
00:46:38,928 --> 00:46:42,295
Shelley moved to Africa
to work with the orphans.

747
00:46:42,365 --> 00:46:43,559
She left while we were gone

748
00:46:43,633 --> 00:46:46,659
because she says
she can't deal with goodbyes.

749
00:46:48,638 --> 00:46:51,334
I'm going to bed. No movies tonight.

750
00:46:54,243 --> 00:46:56,040
You look nervous.

751
00:46:56,112 --> 00:46:59,513
I don't like when you look nervous.
You will not blow this!

752
00:46:59,582 --> 00:47:00,776
But I just wanna mix drinks.

753
00:47:00,850 --> 00:47:03,080
You know, my whole life,
that's all I've ever wanted to do,

754
00:47:03,152 --> 00:47:04,847
is just blend.

755
00:47:04,921 --> 00:47:07,685
And then you come along
with your weird kryptonite death grip, and...

756
00:47:07,757 --> 00:47:10,157
- That's right, it's like this.
- Oh, good God!

757
00:47:10,226 --> 00:47:11,784
Oh, sweet bastard, that's good.

758
00:47:11,861 --> 00:47:15,194
That's right, and I'm the only woman
that can make you feel like that.

759
00:47:15,264 --> 00:47:18,791
You will not tell Hef
that we wrote that letter to Shelley.

760
00:47:18,868 --> 00:47:20,096
- Just do it again.
- Got it?

761
00:47:20,169 --> 00:47:23,036
- Yeah, I got it, I got it, I got it. So I got it.
- Good.

762
00:47:33,449 --> 00:47:34,973
Hi. I'll take two calendars.

763
00:47:35,051 --> 00:47:38,680
Wow. That's so generous.
Everyone's been buying two.

764
00:47:38,755 --> 00:47:41,553
Actually, it's in case one gets ruined.

765
00:47:42,592 --> 00:47:44,753
Hot dogs, Zeta hot dogs. Who wants one?

766
00:47:44,827 --> 00:47:47,318
You. You. You got one.

767
00:47:51,834 --> 00:47:53,734
Sweet setup here.

768
00:47:54,804 --> 00:47:57,796
We should totally have a mixer
with you guys sometime.

769
00:47:57,874 --> 00:47:59,068
Yeah.

770
00:48:03,713 --> 00:48:05,374
<i>We could have one with Battle...</i>

771
00:48:05,448 --> 00:48:06,938
What? One more time.

772
00:48:07,049 --> 00:48:10,541
<i>We could have a Battlestar Galactica night.
With pudding!</i>

773
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:12,645
Definitely! What?

774
00:48:12,722 --> 00:48:14,587
<i>Battlestar Galactica. Okay.</i>

775
00:48:14,657 --> 00:48:18,753
She said that you guys should get together
some night, with pudding.

776
00:48:19,428 --> 00:48:20,588
Whoa.

777
00:48:21,197 --> 00:48:23,427
You betcha. You betcha.

778
00:48:23,499 --> 00:48:27,697
At Phi lota Mu we are very exclusive,
because we can be.

779
00:48:27,770 --> 00:48:30,967
Many of our sisters are leaders on campus.

780
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:36,273
We have a rocking GPA
and our very own Korean manicurist.

781
00:48:42,385 --> 00:48:44,546
Hey, where are you guys going?

782
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:47,589
- Whose booth is that?
- That's Zeta's booth.

783
00:48:48,191 --> 00:48:50,989
Don't be ridiculous.
Why would they have a booth?

784
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:52,152
And who would go to it?

785
00:48:52,228 --> 00:48:54,287
- Do you want some ketchup?
- That'd be great.

786
00:48:54,363 --> 00:48:56,661
I can totally hose you some right there.
Go ahead, lean back.

787
00:48:56,732 --> 00:48:58,563
No, I'm just...

788
00:49:02,371 --> 00:49:04,669
- Excuse me.
- Why, did you fart?

789
00:49:05,575 --> 00:49:07,702
- Did I do what?
- Fart.

790
00:49:09,879 --> 00:49:11,312
Where are the Zetas?

791
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:13,712
We are the Zetas, 2008 edition.

792
00:49:13,783 --> 00:49:15,546
And I'm in love!

793
00:49:28,264 --> 00:49:29,959
Why'd you do that?

794
00:49:30,032 --> 00:49:32,125
I needed to hurt someone.

795
00:49:35,438 --> 00:49:38,669
This is so awesome, you guys.
That was so much fun!

796
00:49:38,741 --> 00:49:40,333
It was, it was.

797
00:49:40,409 --> 00:49:43,401
Harmony, Brian Stone was all over you, girl.

798
00:49:44,347 --> 00:49:45,575
- And how about Mona?
- What?

799
00:49:45,648 --> 00:49:48,515
I got numbers from four boys.
It was all for research.

800
00:49:48,584 --> 00:49:49,642
Liar.

801
00:49:49,719 --> 00:49:51,983
- Careful what you research.
- But I really had fun.

802
00:49:52,054 --> 00:49:57,151
Well, Natalie, Colby was
following you around like a puppy dog.

803
00:49:58,060 --> 00:50:00,756
Do you guys think you'll, you know...

804
00:50:02,098 --> 00:50:03,190
No.

805
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:08,202
I do not think, you know, that.

806
00:50:08,638 --> 00:50:09,866
"That"?

807
00:50:11,474 --> 00:50:14,409
Natalie, are you a virgin?

808
00:50:15,611 --> 00:50:16,976
No.

809
00:50:17,813 --> 00:50:19,974
Am I a virgin? No.

810
00:50:20,816 --> 00:50:21,976
You're a virgin!

811
00:50:22,051 --> 00:50:25,282
Shelley! It's like an amphitheater in here!

812
00:50:25,354 --> 00:50:26,912
That's it.

813
00:50:26,989 --> 00:50:29,219
Oh, my gosh.
We have to have an Aztec party.

814
00:50:29,292 --> 00:50:30,657
We always wanted
to have one at the Mansion,

815
00:50:30,726 --> 00:50:33,854
but we could never find a virgin to sacrifice.

816
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:36,899
Natalie, it is gonna be the best time ever.

817
00:50:36,966 --> 00:50:41,767
We are gonna have the most rockingest
party, and then we'll get our 30 pledges.

818
00:50:56,085 --> 00:50:58,076
Okay, quick trick, watch this.

819
00:50:58,154 --> 00:51:01,248
We are gonna put little trails of Vaseline
on the contours of our abs,

820
00:51:01,324 --> 00:51:05,158
mist it a little,
and that way the light will catch our tans.

821
00:51:07,830 --> 00:51:10,424
Oh, she says
you're completely ingenious, Shelley.

822
00:51:10,499 --> 00:51:12,228
Thank you, Lilly.

823
00:51:12,301 --> 00:51:13,791
That's the same as vapid, right?

824
00:51:13,869 --> 00:51:16,167
Oh, it's better than vapid.

825
00:51:16,238 --> 00:51:19,401
- Is that Juicy?
- Yeah, I love their stuff.

826
00:51:19,475 --> 00:51:22,842
It's a shame nobody'd be able to see it,
you know, under my brace.

827
00:51:22,912 --> 00:51:25,107
Well, when can you take the brace off?

828
00:51:25,181 --> 00:51:27,809
2004, actually.

829
00:51:29,085 --> 00:51:30,985
Well, it's a good thing I asked.

830
00:51:31,053 --> 00:51:36,457
No, I'm so fine.
I mean, you know, it's all indented into me

831
00:51:36,525 --> 00:51:39,517
and, you know, if I took it off, I wouldn't
even know what would possibly happen,

832
00:51:39,595 --> 00:51:42,189
and my spine could be like a noodle. And...

833
00:51:42,264 --> 00:51:44,698
I'm really good. I'm good. Thanks.

834
00:51:46,736 --> 00:51:48,203
Come with me.

835
00:51:48,904 --> 00:51:51,600
Joanne, when I was little,
I wore a Scooby-Doo mask to school

836
00:51:51,674 --> 00:51:54,074
for a whole month
because I thought I was ugly.

837
00:51:54,143 --> 00:51:55,371
- Thanks, guys.
- You're welcome.

838
00:51:55,444 --> 00:51:57,674
And then one day
a boy, Howard Rubenstock,

839
00:51:57,747 --> 00:52:00,238
snuck up behind me and tore it off my face.

840
00:52:00,316 --> 00:52:03,308
- Do you know what I realized?
- That you were pretty?

841
00:52:03,386 --> 00:52:06,048
No, that I was wearing it upside down.

842
00:52:06,655 --> 00:52:08,953
I'm not really sure
what you're trying to tell me, Shelley.

843
00:52:09,025 --> 00:52:13,428
I'm not either. But the point is,
you're a butterfly now, not an earthworm.

844
00:52:13,496 --> 00:52:15,521
You don't need to hide anymore.

845
00:52:15,598 --> 00:52:18,123
So, okay, here he comes.

846
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:21,067
He runs past here every day,
and I've seen you staring at him.

847
00:52:21,137 --> 00:52:23,105
I can tell that you like him
and that you want to talk to him.

848
00:52:23,172 --> 00:52:25,766
Today's the day. Go invite him to our party.

849
00:52:25,841 --> 00:52:27,274
Go. Go.

850
00:52:32,348 --> 00:52:34,145
Run, Joanne, run!

851
00:53:01,544 --> 00:53:02,670
Hi, Steve.

852
00:53:02,745 --> 00:53:05,805
Oh, hey, Joanne. How are you?
I didn't know you ran.

853
00:53:05,881 --> 00:53:08,042
Sure, I mean, I do now.

854
00:53:08,117 --> 00:53:09,482
Where's your brace?

855
00:53:09,552 --> 00:53:11,417
- It's gone.
- Really?

856
00:53:17,593 --> 00:53:19,151
Well.

857
00:53:19,228 --> 00:53:21,389
You're pretty pleased with yourself,
aren't you?

858
00:53:21,464 --> 00:53:25,059
Oh, you scared me.
My heart's pounding like a nail.

859
00:53:26,702 --> 00:53:29,102
I guess I am a little proud.

860
00:53:29,171 --> 00:53:31,537
Well, don't get too used to that feeling.

861
00:53:31,607 --> 00:53:34,701
Because there's no way that I'm going
to let a whorey little tart like you

862
00:53:34,777 --> 00:53:37,473
stand in the way of the Phi lota Mu.

863
00:53:38,147 --> 00:53:40,172
Don't mess with me.

864
00:53:40,249 --> 00:53:42,513
Don't mess with Phi lota Mu.

865
00:53:47,423 --> 00:53:52,292
Man! Someone needs a mani-pedi
massage combo, pronto.

866
00:53:52,361 --> 00:53:53,453
- Shelley!
- Oh, my...

867
00:53:53,529 --> 00:53:55,895
Steve said he's gonna come
to the Aztec party.

868
00:53:55,965 --> 00:53:57,489
Steve, he's gonna come.

869
00:53:57,566 --> 00:54:00,194
Yay! This is gonna be so much fun!

870
00:54:17,319 --> 00:54:20,777
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- God! Oh, my God!

871
00:54:20,856 --> 00:54:23,051
- Yes!
- Hey, you guys! Look.

872
00:54:23,659 --> 00:54:25,024
Oh, Joanne.

873
00:54:25,861 --> 00:54:28,830
I can bend! You guys, I did it, I can bend!

874
00:54:32,434 --> 00:54:35,198
"Do you find yourself
more attracted to me when I'm like this,

875
00:54:35,271 --> 00:54:36,932
"or like this?"

876
00:54:38,007 --> 00:54:39,907
- The second one.
- Great.

877
00:54:40,442 --> 00:54:42,706
So, "Because you like my boobs,

878
00:54:42,778 --> 00:54:46,009
"would you stand there
and let me go like this

879
00:54:46,916 --> 00:54:50,079
"for five minutes,
just in the hope that we might hook up?"

880
00:54:50,152 --> 00:54:52,484
Yes. Yes, I would.

881
00:54:55,824 --> 00:54:58,918
Guys! Anybody want some chips?

882
00:54:59,762 --> 00:55:01,389
Yeah, have chips while you party.

883
00:55:01,463 --> 00:55:04,364
Badass party. Badass.

884
00:55:04,433 --> 00:55:08,870
So, Miss December,
you got your bikini on under there? Huh?

885
00:55:08,938 --> 00:55:11,736
No, actually, just my fake water...

886
00:55:11,807 --> 00:55:13,434
Natalie, there you are.

887
00:55:13,509 --> 00:55:17,468
Oh, Bobby and Zach from Kappa are just
dying to meet you.

888
00:55:17,546 --> 00:55:21,004
I'm sorry, Colby,
but Natalie is a very hot commodity.

889
00:55:22,451 --> 00:55:24,078
- Excuse us.
- Wait.

890
00:55:24,687 --> 00:55:25,984
Wait a second.

891
00:55:26,055 --> 00:55:27,818
- Are we leaving?
- Yes.

892
00:55:27,890 --> 00:55:28,982
Why?

893
00:55:29,058 --> 00:55:31,526
I have, like,
the world's hugest crush on him.

894
00:55:31,594 --> 00:55:32,583
So I don't really...

895
00:55:32,661 --> 00:55:35,425
I know. Then we need to let him see
how in demand you are.

896
00:55:35,497 --> 00:55:38,364
Always remember,
boys want what other boys want.

897
00:55:38,434 --> 00:55:39,731
Right.

898
00:55:42,238 --> 00:55:43,796
Are you Lilly?

899
00:55:45,307 --> 00:55:47,639
That's a cute costume, Lil.

900
00:55:47,710 --> 00:55:50,042
I was gonna ask you this,
because I've been seeing these all over.

901
00:55:50,112 --> 00:55:51,943
I mean, this is an Aztec party,

902
00:55:52,014 --> 00:55:55,142
you know, so those statues don't really fit,
because those are from Easter Island,

903
00:55:55,217 --> 00:55:58,152
which is like 2000 miles away,
as you probably know, in Polynesia.

904
00:55:58,220 --> 00:56:02,486
Wait, Natalie. You're too smart.
Boys don't like girls that are too smart.

905
00:56:02,558 --> 00:56:03,752
Right.

906
00:56:03,826 --> 00:56:07,125
Right.
God, I hope Colby didn't hear me say that.

907
00:56:08,030 --> 00:56:10,658
Shelley, you really know all the tricks.

908
00:56:10,733 --> 00:56:12,325
How do you do it, you know?

909
00:56:12,401 --> 00:56:14,995
I mean, with Colby here
and with Oliver asking you out,

910
00:56:15,070 --> 00:56:18,471
it's like we might both
lose our virginity this year.

911
00:56:19,708 --> 00:56:21,005
Yeah.

912
00:56:25,848 --> 00:56:29,375
It's supposed to be a mixer.
There's no one here to mix.

913
00:56:30,119 --> 00:56:33,111
They're over there, aren't they? The Kappas.

914
00:56:33,188 --> 00:56:35,816
Well, they're definitely not here.

915
00:56:35,891 --> 00:56:38,587
I know that, dipswitch. I can see that.

916
00:56:41,997 --> 00:56:44,989
<i>And now, let the sacrificial rites begin!</i>

917
00:56:48,337 --> 00:56:53,138
<i>It's time for this virgin
to get sacrificed in the boiling Jell-O lava!</i>

918
00:56:53,942 --> 00:56:56,672
- Sacrifice! Sacrifice!
- Sacrifice! Sacrifice!

919
00:56:56,745 --> 00:56:58,838
- Sacrifice! Sacrifice!
- Sacrifice! Sacrifice!

920
00:56:58,914 --> 00:57:03,851
<i>This is Aztec Night, the first of many
awesome Zeta parties to come.</i>

921
00:57:03,919 --> 00:57:05,887
<i>And for those of you girls
going through rush,</i>

922
00:57:05,954 --> 00:57:09,082
<i>remember to make Zeta
your number-one choice!</i>

923
00:57:13,662 --> 00:57:15,653
The time is now.

924
00:57:47,329 --> 00:57:48,626
Yeah.

925
00:57:50,199 --> 00:57:53,259
I've never seen anybody
get sacrificed before.

926
00:57:54,136 --> 00:57:55,899
That was so hot.

927
00:57:55,971 --> 00:57:59,134
I mean, I don't know anything about Aztecs,
you know? Or their culture.

928
00:57:59,208 --> 00:58:02,268
But, I mean, I do know that I had fun.

929
00:58:02,344 --> 00:58:06,542
Yeah. I don't know anything
about them either, so that's awesome.

930
00:58:14,056 --> 00:58:16,616
What have the Zetas become?

931
00:58:16,692 --> 00:58:18,489
Oh, my God.

932
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:19,788
Popular.

933
00:58:39,815 --> 00:58:41,476
Remember, be sexy.

934
00:58:41,550 --> 00:58:44,314
- He's gonna love your shoes.
- Deep breath, take a deep breath.

935
00:58:44,386 --> 00:58:47,321
Okay, okay, he's here. Okay.

936
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:53,418
- Hello.
- Hello.

937
00:58:53,495 --> 00:58:55,292
Wow, you look great.

938
00:58:55,964 --> 00:58:57,898
- Thank you.
- You ready?

939
00:59:03,605 --> 00:59:06,574
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

940
00:59:06,642 --> 00:59:10,169
- Would you mind if we walked?
- Oh, yes, I like to walk.

941
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:14,505
And that's not the only thing I like.

942
00:59:14,583 --> 00:59:17,916
No? You have a wide range of interests?

943
00:59:18,387 --> 00:59:22,153
Oh, yes. A big range.

944
00:59:24,526 --> 00:59:26,858
Oh, wait here for a second.

945
00:59:26,929 --> 00:59:29,955
I think I dropped some money
over here the other day.

946
00:59:30,032 --> 00:59:32,626
I just don't know wherever could it be.

947
00:59:32,701 --> 00:59:35,534
Maybe it's over here by this manhole.

948
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:40,508
That's fucking hot!

949
00:59:42,311 --> 00:59:46,680
I just went over there to look for my money

950
00:59:46,748 --> 00:59:49,581
which I had dropped the other day.

951
00:59:49,651 --> 00:59:53,382
I think it was a dollar coin,
because I heard a clanging.

952
00:59:54,122 --> 00:59:56,784
But anyway, wow.

953
00:59:57,693 --> 00:59:59,752
Who knew steam can be hot?

954
01:00:00,162 --> 01:00:01,720
Yeah, that's...

955
01:00:01,797 --> 01:00:04,288
I wonder what they did
when Marilyn Monroe did it.

956
01:00:04,366 --> 01:00:09,360
They probably added soothing botanicals
to the steam rising from the manhole.

957
01:00:09,438 --> 01:00:11,099
I like that word.

958
01:00:11,173 --> 01:00:12,640
"Manhole."

959
01:00:14,276 --> 01:00:16,767
All right. What can I get you guys?

960
01:00:18,647 --> 01:00:23,050
Instead of the mahi-mahi,
may I just get the one mahi,

961
01:00:23,118 --> 01:00:25,382
because I'm not that hungry?

962
01:00:26,121 --> 01:00:27,452
I'll ask.

963
01:00:29,424 --> 01:00:33,087
The chicken piccata for me.
Yeah, that'd be fine.

964
01:00:33,161 --> 01:00:34,788
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

965
01:00:34,863 --> 01:00:37,889
"Piccata." That's another word I like.

966
01:00:38,901 --> 01:00:40,061
Piccata.

967
01:00:40,135 --> 01:00:44,401
- Yeah, it just rolls off the tongue, doesn't it?
- Sounds like "Hotta."

968
01:00:44,473 --> 01:00:45,599
Yeah.

969
01:00:45,974 --> 01:00:48,340
Or "the Spanish Armada."

970
01:00:49,912 --> 01:00:52,005
- I like to rhyme.
- Yeah?

971
01:00:53,882 --> 01:00:57,716
...and StairMaster to tone the buttock area.

972
01:00:58,487 --> 01:01:01,752
I'd show you,
but who really wants to see my butt?

973
01:01:04,092 --> 01:01:08,256
I mean, it's just a silly old butt
with no tan lines.

974
01:01:09,932 --> 01:01:11,365
Yep.

975
01:01:11,433 --> 01:01:15,995
Wow, this was really good food.
I hope it doesn't go straight to my butt.

976
01:01:17,039 --> 01:01:21,339
I mean, I think my butt would still
be a pretty good one, though.

977
01:01:22,244 --> 01:01:24,235
Yep. My ass.

978
01:01:25,447 --> 01:01:27,074
Oh, well, this has been fun,

979
01:01:27,149 --> 01:01:31,609
but we should probably wrap it up,
because I've got another date at 11.

980
01:01:32,254 --> 01:01:33,312
Are you serious?

981
01:01:33,388 --> 01:01:36,551
Well, what's a girl in demand going to do?

982
01:01:39,428 --> 01:01:40,656
Wow. Okay.

983
01:01:40,729 --> 01:01:43,562
Yeah, well, dinner's on me.

984
01:01:43,632 --> 01:01:48,069
I'm gonna get going. I wouldn't want you
to keep the other guy waiting.

985
01:01:49,638 --> 01:01:50,900
Wait!

986
01:01:50,973 --> 01:01:53,441
Your biceps are huge! Kiss me.

987
01:01:59,414 --> 01:02:00,403
Oh, my God.

988
01:02:05,287 --> 01:02:06,413
Yeah, right.

989
01:02:06,488 --> 01:02:08,285
Shelley's back.

990
01:02:08,357 --> 01:02:10,917
- How'd it go?
- How'd it go, Shelley?

991
01:02:12,194 --> 01:02:13,491
Not good.

992
01:02:13,562 --> 01:02:15,393
- What?
- Why?

993
01:02:15,464 --> 01:02:17,432
I don't think he likes me.

994
01:02:17,499 --> 01:02:20,127
He didn't fall for any of my tricks.

995
01:02:20,936 --> 01:02:23,461
That's impossible, your tricks always work.

996
01:02:23,538 --> 01:02:28,032
I did sexy, I did "other guys want me."

997
01:02:28,110 --> 01:02:31,045
You know, I worked every angle in the book.

998
01:02:31,113 --> 01:02:33,741
But I don't know, he just stared.

999
01:02:34,583 --> 01:02:37,108
What if Oliver is one of those guys

1000
01:02:37,185 --> 01:02:40,348
who wants to have, like, a conversation
with a girl before he hooks up with her?

1001
01:02:40,422 --> 01:02:41,719
He's gay?

1002
01:02:42,424 --> 01:02:44,153
No, he's not gay.

1003
01:02:45,394 --> 01:02:47,862
Oh, I don't know.

1004
01:02:50,966 --> 01:02:54,732
I'm just saying, you know,
maybe he wants to talk first.

1005
01:02:54,803 --> 01:02:57,795
What if Oliver doesn't mind a smart girl?

1006
01:02:58,974 --> 01:03:00,532
- I know.
- Wait.

1007
01:03:01,677 --> 01:03:05,443
So I have to learn things
about things and stuff?

1008
01:03:06,348 --> 01:03:07,906
About topics?

1009
01:03:09,851 --> 01:03:12,115
- Can I even do that?
- Yeah. You can do that.

1010
01:03:12,187 --> 01:03:14,382
You can do anything
you set your mind to, Shelley.

1011
01:04:32,467 --> 01:04:35,197
But you can't even tell I have boobs.

1012
01:04:35,270 --> 01:04:37,670
Well, don't you think I should show him
a little something?

1013
01:04:37,739 --> 01:04:40,105
Give him a little philanthropy?

1014
01:04:40,175 --> 01:04:43,167
Shelley, good job.
You used "philanthropy." That was fun.

1015
01:04:43,245 --> 01:04:46,146
You know what? You're still too sexy.

1016
01:04:46,214 --> 01:04:48,182
Nat, what if she wears your glasses?

1017
01:04:48,250 --> 01:04:50,582
Good idea. Okay, here.

1018
01:04:51,086 --> 01:04:52,610
Try these.

1019
01:04:54,756 --> 01:04:58,283
Oh, my God. Natalie, you should really
go to an eye doctor.

1020
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:01,158
That's actually how I got those glasses.

1021
01:05:01,229 --> 01:05:02,992
So have you called Oliver yet?

1022
01:05:03,064 --> 01:05:06,295
Yes. He didn't seem too excited
to be going out on a second date,

1023
01:05:06,368 --> 01:05:09,428
but he said yes, so here goes.

1024
01:05:09,504 --> 01:05:12,940
All right. Now remember,
just be yourself, only different.

1025
01:05:13,008 --> 01:05:15,340
- Don't use the word "elucidate."
- Pretty much entirely different.

1026
01:05:15,410 --> 01:05:17,207
- You know what I'm talking about?
- Tone down the sexuality.

1027
01:05:17,279 --> 01:05:20,077
Talk about politics and religion.
That's always a really good first-date topic.

1028
01:05:20,148 --> 01:05:22,582
- Don't stare at him too much.
- Don't brush your teeth.

1029
01:05:22,651 --> 01:05:23,982
- Bye, Shell.
- Bye.

1030
01:05:24,052 --> 01:05:27,510
- Don't forget to call, Shelley.
- Say you're nauseous.

1031
01:05:28,456 --> 01:05:32,756
A nuclear nonproliferation treaty
should ease tension in Asia.

1032
01:05:32,828 --> 01:05:35,262
Well, that's my thought.

1033
01:05:35,330 --> 01:05:37,764
- Are you okay? With your...
- Oh, yes.

1034
01:05:37,833 --> 01:05:40,961
These glasses don't make me dizzy
or anything.

1035
01:05:41,703 --> 01:05:43,603
Elucidate on that.

1036
01:05:45,273 --> 01:05:49,073
Well, you seem to know a lot
about North Korea and the Middle East.

1037
01:05:49,144 --> 01:05:51,009
It sounds like you really read the paper.

1038
01:05:51,079 --> 01:05:55,345
Oh, all the time.
I am just nuts about the paper.

1039
01:05:55,417 --> 01:05:59,444
So, have you given any thought
to who you might be voting for?

1040
01:05:59,521 --> 01:06:01,284
I'm not sure yet.

1041
01:06:02,257 --> 01:06:06,091
I definitely won't listen to what Simon says.

1042
01:06:06,161 --> 01:06:07,958
He is just so mean.

1043
01:06:08,029 --> 01:06:11,157
I usually always agree
with Paula and Randy.

1044
01:06:13,568 --> 01:06:17,095
Oh, you meant
the President of the United States.

1045
01:06:18,373 --> 01:06:20,671
The United States of America.

1046
01:06:21,309 --> 01:06:23,539
U.S.A. for short.

1047
01:06:23,612 --> 01:06:28,015
Fifty states, if you include Hawaii.
Most people do. I'm definitely pro-Hawaii.

1048
01:06:28,083 --> 01:06:29,778
- Excuse me.
- Oh, thank God.

1049
01:06:29,851 --> 01:06:31,546
Can I get you anything else?

1050
01:06:31,620 --> 01:06:33,611
No, I think we're good, thanks.

1051
01:06:33,688 --> 01:06:37,385
Hey, I know where I know you from.

1052
01:06:37,459 --> 01:06:40,587
<i>You were in Playboy.
"Girls with GEDs," right?</i>

1053
01:06:41,730 --> 01:06:43,220
Oh, heck, no!

1054
01:06:44,199 --> 01:06:45,257
No!

1055
01:06:45,333 --> 01:06:48,302
Those girls are all boobs and no brains.

1056
01:06:48,370 --> 01:06:53,000
I'm too busy in a library,
reading books with dust on them.

1057
01:06:53,074 --> 01:06:54,166
How...

1058
01:06:54,242 --> 01:06:56,437
Sorry. My mistake, then. Sorry.

1059
01:06:56,511 --> 01:06:57,705
No.

1060
01:06:58,079 --> 01:07:01,674
<i>Playboy. God. Can you believe it?</i>

1061
01:07:02,684 --> 01:07:05,744
I'm still hungry, even though we just ate.

1062
01:07:05,820 --> 01:07:08,789
Oh, my gosh, I can't believe I did that.

1063
01:07:10,025 --> 01:07:13,722
- Sorry, let me take care of that.
- It's okay. It's okay.

1064
01:07:13,795 --> 01:07:15,592
Are those index cards?

1065
01:07:15,664 --> 01:07:18,497
No. Index... They're napkins.

1066
01:07:18,566 --> 01:07:21,626
They're not index cards
with writing on them.

1067
01:07:22,437 --> 01:07:24,962
Let me get some more napkins.

1068
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:27,531
That's okay, really. I think...

1069
01:07:32,814 --> 01:07:34,281
Sweet balls!

1070
01:07:36,885 --> 01:07:38,546
I can't believe that happened.

1071
01:07:38,620 --> 01:07:41,953
I'm sorry about all the gravity.

1072
01:07:42,023 --> 01:07:43,752
Are you all right?

1073
01:07:51,566 --> 01:07:54,626
I'm sorry, Oliver.

1074
01:07:55,070 --> 01:07:56,401
I'm sorry.

1075
01:07:57,138 --> 01:07:58,901
I need to go.

1076
01:08:15,957 --> 01:08:18,448
Come on, Puffin,
you've been in here for days.

1077
01:08:18,526 --> 01:08:21,723
Let's watch a movie,
it'll make you feel better.

1078
01:08:22,330 --> 01:08:24,059
I don't get it.

1079
01:08:24,132 --> 01:08:26,600
Why would Shelley just leave?

1080
01:08:26,668 --> 01:08:29,000
It's for the best. She wasn't happy.

1081
01:08:29,070 --> 01:08:32,506
I used to hear her crying
in her room late at night.

1082
01:08:33,441 --> 01:08:36,274
I think I'd like to be alone for a bit.

1083
01:08:40,515 --> 01:08:42,506
I could stay with you.

1084
01:08:43,018 --> 01:08:45,509
No, just bring me more ice cream.

1085
01:08:46,554 --> 01:08:48,317
Egg! Paprika!

1086
01:08:49,491 --> 01:08:52,619
Nutmeg! Who cares? Who cares?

1087
01:08:53,528 --> 01:08:56,053
What have I done to poor Shelley?

1088
01:08:58,466 --> 01:09:00,058
You're not gonna tell him, are you?

1089
01:09:00,135 --> 01:09:01,966
No. You can't.

1090
01:09:02,037 --> 01:09:05,996
I'm gonna be the next Miss November,
not that little blonde bitch.

1091
01:09:06,074 --> 01:09:10,135
You found my weakness,
used it against me like kryptonite,

1092
01:09:10,211 --> 01:09:12,805
but that's never gonna happen again.

1093
01:09:13,782 --> 01:09:15,613
"Oh, Mr. Hefner..."

1094
01:09:17,252 --> 01:09:20,050
Guys, remember, we only need 30, okay?

1095
01:09:21,456 --> 01:09:22,923
First up,

1096
01:09:23,525 --> 01:09:24,719
Kristen Withers.

1097
01:09:24,793 --> 01:09:26,886
Pre-med, family in Greenwich.

1098
01:09:26,961 --> 01:09:28,428
- Yeah, so cute.
- I like.

1099
01:09:28,496 --> 01:09:30,088
Cute, cute. Totally.

1100
01:09:30,165 --> 01:09:31,223
- No doubt.
- Very cute.

1101
01:09:31,299 --> 01:09:32,823
- In.
- Guys...

1102
01:09:32,901 --> 01:09:35,768
We just made our first pledge acceptance.

1103
01:09:38,706 --> 01:09:41,732
Okay, cool. All right. Next up, Jill Palmer.

1104
01:09:41,810 --> 01:09:46,144
Colorado, theater major...
Her father owns, like, half of Aspen.

1105
01:09:46,214 --> 01:09:47,476
- Yes.
- Yeah!

1106
01:09:55,657 --> 01:09:58,057
Why am I such a yummy dummy?

1107
01:09:58,126 --> 01:09:59,491
Next one.

1108
01:10:01,229 --> 01:10:05,063
Nancy Nagle. English major from Florida.

1109
01:10:05,900 --> 01:10:07,060
But she does drive a Porsche.

1110
01:10:07,135 --> 01:10:10,434
I just don't know about this one.
I kind of feel like we've created this image.

1111
01:10:10,505 --> 01:10:12,405
I just don't feel like she's gonna fit in.

1112
01:10:18,947 --> 01:10:22,314
I'm just saying, she should have spent
the Porsche money on a nose job.

1113
01:10:22,383 --> 01:10:24,908
She said she broke it in a skiing accident
last year, and I'm like,

1114
01:10:24,986 --> 01:10:28,615
"Okay, I'm sure the nose surgeon would
take the Porsche as a trade-in."

1115
01:10:28,690 --> 01:10:30,214
Booya! Snap!

1116
01:10:36,231 --> 01:10:37,255
Hello?

1117
01:10:37,332 --> 01:10:39,232
<i>Hey, Shelley, it's me.</i>

1118
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:41,200
<i>- Hef?
- Yeah.</i>

1119
01:10:41,269 --> 01:10:44,397
Hef? Oh, is this you? Oh, my gosh.

1120
01:10:44,472 --> 01:10:47,339
How are you?
Like, I can't believe you're calling me.

1121
01:10:47,408 --> 01:10:50,571
How is everybody at the Mansion?
How are things?

1122
01:10:50,645 --> 01:10:54,046
<i>Good news. I'm gonna make you
next month's centerfold.</i>

1123
01:10:54,115 --> 01:10:55,912
You're making me Miss November?

1124
01:10:55,984 --> 01:10:58,145
<i>- That's right.
- Oh, my gosh.</i>

1125
01:10:58,219 --> 01:11:00,915
Are you totally serious, or is this not Hef?

1126
01:11:00,989 --> 01:11:03,685
If this is Hef, blink once.
If it isn't Hef, blink twice.

1127
01:11:03,758 --> 01:11:05,248
Did you blink?

1128
01:11:06,361 --> 01:11:09,262
I'm so glad you haven't changed, Shelley.

1129
01:11:09,330 --> 01:11:11,491
And I want you to move
back to the Mansion.

1130
01:11:11,566 --> 01:11:14,330
<i>It's just not the same without you here.</i>

1131
01:11:15,270 --> 01:11:17,830
Hef, I just can't believe it.

1132
01:11:17,906 --> 01:11:18,964
<i>Believe it, baby.</i>

1133
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:20,940
<i>Okay, here's what happens.</i>

1134
01:11:21,009 --> 01:11:24,445
<i>We shoot the pictorial, we'll have you do
a 25-city tour of the United States.</i>

1135
01:11:24,512 --> 01:11:26,707
<i>And then from there
we're gonna travel Europe,</i>

1136
01:11:26,781 --> 01:11:28,646
<i>ending with a one-week stay in Monaco.</i>

1137
01:11:28,716 --> 01:11:30,274
<i>We're gonna coordinate your pictorial</i>

1138
01:11:30,351 --> 01:11:33,411
<i>with a Playboy Channel documentary
on the life of a centerfold.</i>

1139
01:11:33,488 --> 01:11:36,321
<i>The exposure's going to be wonderful,
but it doesn't stop there.</i>

1140
01:11:36,391 --> 01:11:38,791
<i>We're going to pull out all the stops
for this one, Shelley.</i>

1141
01:11:38,860 --> 01:11:40,293
<i>It's going to be huge.</i>

1142
01:11:40,361 --> 01:11:41,794
Hef?

1143
01:11:41,863 --> 01:11:43,353
<i>Yeah, baby?</i>

1144
01:11:44,999 --> 01:11:47,297
Hef, I'm so sorry.

1145
01:11:47,368 --> 01:11:49,836
I'm so happy that you called me.

1146
01:11:50,905 --> 01:11:52,964
And I love you, but I don't think I can do it.

1147
01:11:53,041 --> 01:11:55,100
<i>I can't leave my Zeta girls.</i>

1148
01:11:55,176 --> 01:11:56,438
What?

1149
01:11:57,212 --> 01:11:59,180
I'm not going anywhere.

1150
01:12:01,249 --> 01:12:02,648
I'm home.

1151
01:12:06,487 --> 01:12:08,717
Katootoo Jihiman.

1152
01:12:09,490 --> 01:12:12,482
Sociology major from India. Everyone?

1153
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:14,790
I remember this one.
She seems kind of weird.

1154
01:12:14,862 --> 01:12:15,988
I actually got that, too.

1155
01:12:16,064 --> 01:12:18,760
Not like an "I live in the wall
and eat crickets" kind of weird,

1156
01:12:18,833 --> 01:12:20,323
but just like a little off.

1157
01:12:20,401 --> 01:12:22,801
- Boo to Katootoo.
- Next.

1158
01:12:24,038 --> 01:12:26,598
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

1159
01:12:27,542 --> 01:12:28,566
Lilly?

1160
01:12:28,643 --> 01:12:30,406
Look at you people!

1161
01:12:30,478 --> 01:12:33,345
Honestly, is this really what you've become?

1162
01:12:33,414 --> 01:12:36,975
Judging other girls on their appearance?
Calling them weird?

1163
01:12:37,051 --> 01:12:39,576
I'm sure glad I joined when I did,
because honestly,

1164
01:12:39,654 --> 01:12:41,747
I don't think
I would make the cut these days.

1165
01:12:41,823 --> 01:12:43,791
And neither would a lot of you.

1166
01:12:43,858 --> 01:12:47,817
I can't believe that Zeta's become
just like Phi lota Mu.

1167
01:12:47,895 --> 01:12:50,125
A bunch of snooty bitches!

1168
01:12:51,766 --> 01:12:53,461
Lilly, you talked.

1169
01:12:54,035 --> 01:12:55,764
And you're British?

1170
01:13:09,951 --> 01:13:12,044
Hi, everybody. I'm home.

1171
01:13:13,488 --> 01:13:15,183
This is all your fault.

1172
01:13:15,256 --> 01:13:17,281
Yeah. You know what, Mona? You're right.

1173
01:13:17,358 --> 01:13:20,657
It all started with this fake hair
and your stupid water bras.

1174
01:13:20,728 --> 01:13:23,219
You know what?
Before you got here, we were individuals.

1175
01:13:23,298 --> 01:13:25,425
You've turned us all into stupid bimbos.

1176
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:27,468
- We were fine the way we were.
- We look ridiculous.

1177
01:13:27,535 --> 01:13:29,560
- I'm getting Cs in all my classes.
- Why am I looking like this?

1178
01:13:29,637 --> 01:13:31,867
- This isn't who I am.
- I can't believe you let me do this to myself.

1179
01:13:31,939 --> 01:13:34,407
Guys, stop. Come on, stop, stop.

1180
01:13:34,475 --> 01:13:35,567
Guys.

1181
01:13:38,713 --> 01:13:40,977
I understand, and I'm sorry.

1182
01:13:42,784 --> 01:13:44,342
So I...

1183
01:13:45,453 --> 01:13:47,444
Thank you guys for everything.

1184
01:13:47,522 --> 01:13:51,481
I'm gonna go, and I really hope
to see you guys in the future.

1185
01:13:52,894 --> 01:13:54,156
Shelley.

1186
01:14:04,706 --> 01:14:06,435
Hi, Hef, it's Shelley.

1187
01:14:06,507 --> 01:14:08,771
I was just kidding, silly.

1188
01:14:08,843 --> 01:14:12,574
I can't wait to be back at the Mansion
and be a centerfold.

1189
01:14:13,147 --> 01:14:15,741
This is the happiest day of my life.

1190
01:14:17,218 --> 01:14:18,446
<i>Dear Oliver,</i>

1191
01:14:18,519 --> 01:14:21,181
<i>I'm so sorry I couldn't tell you
this in person.</i>

1192
01:14:21,255 --> 01:14:24,554
<i>It was way too embarrassing
to face you after everything.</i>

1193
01:14:24,625 --> 01:14:28,254
<i>I am leaving the Zeta house
to fulfill my lifelong dream.</i>

1194
01:14:28,963 --> 01:14:33,832
<i>And I know that what I've decided to do
won't make any sense to you at all,</i>

1195
01:14:33,901 --> 01:14:35,698
<i>but I have joined the Peace Corps,</i>

1196
01:14:35,770 --> 01:14:39,968
<i>and I'm going off to work in the mountains
of a country called Peru.</i>

1197
01:14:41,409 --> 01:14:44,139
<i>I'm going to meet lots of interesting people.</i>

1198
01:14:44,212 --> 01:14:46,544
<i>I'm sure it'll be very hot where I'm going.</i>

1199
01:14:46,614 --> 01:14:48,275
<i>And even though it's going to be super-hot,</i>

1200
01:14:48,349 --> 01:14:52,308
<i>I will be bundled up in clothes,
barely showing any flesh.</i>

1201
01:14:52,387 --> 01:14:54,446
<i>I only tell you that because
I don't want you to worry</i>

1202
01:14:54,522 --> 01:14:56,649
<i>about me getting sunburned.</i>

1203
01:14:58,259 --> 01:15:01,956
Hef told me what you did,
and I don't think it was very sisterly of you.

1204
01:15:02,029 --> 01:15:03,929
You are so vapid.

1205
01:15:04,999 --> 01:15:09,595
Actually, I'm ingenious and philanthropic,
and you're a backstabbing bitch.

1206
01:15:11,205 --> 01:15:13,696
- Nice, Shelley. That was awesome.
- Shelley!

1207
01:15:13,775 --> 01:15:16,903
<i>I hope everybody at the old folks' home
is doing great.</i>

1208
01:15:16,978 --> 01:15:20,345
<i>And as for the Zeta girls,
I'm sure they're doing fine.</i>

1209
01:15:20,415 --> 01:15:24,374
<i>Oliver, I hope you think of me
every once in a while, and when you do,</i>

1210
01:15:24,452 --> 01:15:26,386
<i>I hope they are good thoughts.</i>

1211
01:15:26,454 --> 01:15:27,512
Pooter!

1212
01:15:27,588 --> 01:15:29,249
<i>Love, Shelley.</i>

1213
01:15:30,425 --> 01:15:32,154
There you are.

1214
01:15:34,095 --> 01:15:37,792
So we'll be half Shelley
and half who we really are.

1215
01:15:38,699 --> 01:15:40,792
Can we be 60% Shelley?

1216
01:15:40,868 --> 01:15:44,031
I mean, say what you want about her,
but the girl had style.

1217
01:15:44,105 --> 01:15:46,903
- What?
- "She had style"?

1218
01:15:47,308 --> 01:15:50,800
She still does. I mean, she just wants
to be back at the Playboy Mansion.

1219
01:15:50,878 --> 01:15:53,312
Well, whatever we're gonna be,
we need to figure out, you guys.

1220
01:15:53,381 --> 01:15:58,284
We still need 30 pledges by October 15th,
or we can just kiss it all goodbye.

1221
01:15:58,352 --> 01:16:01,344
Who wants to be a part of something real?
Zeta.

1222
01:16:01,422 --> 01:16:03,549
Hi. Zeta. Tell 29 of your friends.

1223
01:16:03,624 --> 01:16:07,822
Listen up, ladies! Zeta was founded
on the tenets of sisterhood,

1224
01:16:07,895 --> 01:16:09,726
friendship and philanthropy.

1225
01:16:09,797 --> 01:16:10,889
Here you go.

1226
01:16:10,965 --> 01:16:14,196
Yeah, and since then, we've added some
pretty kick-ass parties to the list.

1227
01:16:14,268 --> 01:16:16,133
Yeah, but instead of judging and rejecting,

1228
01:16:16,204 --> 01:16:19,230
we'll put all the pledges we get into a bowl,
and we'll draw 30 names out.

1229
01:16:19,307 --> 01:16:21,798
Natalie? What'd you do to your hair?

1230
01:16:21,876 --> 01:16:24,310
- I could change it back.
- Why?

1231
01:16:24,378 --> 01:16:25,902
Everyone gets haircuts.

1232
01:16:25,980 --> 01:16:28,505
People have lots of different styles
all over the world.

1233
01:16:28,583 --> 01:16:32,610
In China,
they usually tend to layer it, I've noticed.

1234
01:16:32,687 --> 01:16:35,781
This isn't China, though. So, I just...
You know, I could put it back to how it was.

1235
01:16:35,857 --> 01:16:38,485
Oh, no, no. Why, why, why? You look great.

1236
01:16:39,827 --> 01:16:41,624
- I do?
- Yeah.

1237
01:16:41,696 --> 01:16:44,062
Well, I mean, you looked great before,
with the hair.

1238
01:16:44,131 --> 01:16:47,532
But, I mean, this feels more you.

1239
01:16:47,602 --> 01:16:50,435
I mean, besides,
it's not like I want you to be my girlfriend

1240
01:16:50,505 --> 01:16:53,406
just because of your hairstyle. So...

1241
01:16:53,474 --> 01:16:55,271
Your girlfriend?

1242
01:16:55,343 --> 01:16:58,437
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

1243
01:16:58,513 --> 01:16:59,605
It's kind of presumptuous.

1244
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:02,649
It's like, "Hey, you wanna be my girlfriend?
Sit next to me."

1245
01:17:02,717 --> 01:17:04,708
No, no.
I mean, you don't want to be my girlfriend.

1246
01:17:04,785 --> 01:17:08,016
You got guys falling from trees for you,
and it's like...

1247
01:17:08,089 --> 01:17:10,853
Here I am, just a goofy dude.

1248
01:17:12,193 --> 01:17:13,683
"Goofy dude"?

1249
01:17:15,863 --> 01:17:21,199
Colby, I want to be your girlfriend more
than an electron wants to attach to a proton.

1250
01:17:22,537 --> 01:17:24,937
- That much?
- Yeah.

1251
01:17:29,410 --> 01:17:30,536
Yeah?

1252
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:39,546
What? What?

1253
01:17:39,620 --> 01:17:42,783
Did I mess that up?
Because I can do that so much better.

1254
01:17:43,124 --> 01:17:46,719
No, I was just thanking Shelley.

1255
01:17:47,128 --> 01:17:49,028
Oh. Thank you, Shelley.

1256
01:17:57,605 --> 01:18:00,073
Okay, guys. Close your eyes.

1257
01:18:05,446 --> 01:18:08,176
This is it. We're gonna keep the Zeta house.

1258
01:18:08,282 --> 01:18:11,581
- Oh, my gosh.
- Go, Zeta! Go, Zeta! Go, Zeta! Go, Zeta!

1259
01:18:11,652 --> 01:18:12,880
Lilly, go mail the bids.

1260
01:18:21,228 --> 01:18:22,286
Hi.

1261
01:18:22,997 --> 01:18:24,555
Are you new on campus?

1262
01:18:24,665 --> 01:18:26,428
I don't think we've ever met.

1263
01:18:26,500 --> 01:18:28,593
I'm Cole. Cole Trickle.

1264
01:18:31,272 --> 01:18:34,036
Yes. Yes, I just transferred.

1265
01:18:35,209 --> 01:18:37,006
My name is Lilly.

1266
01:18:38,446 --> 01:18:39,777
- Hi.
- Hi.

1267
01:18:40,648 --> 01:18:42,809
That girl over there just
dropped these on the floor,

1268
01:18:42,883 --> 01:18:45,215
and she's really into that guy.

1269
01:18:45,286 --> 01:18:47,618
- And I don't want to interrupt her.
- Okay.

1270
01:18:47,688 --> 01:18:49,849
- Can you mail these out for her?
- Sure thing.

1271
01:18:49,924 --> 01:18:51,448
Thank you.

1272
01:18:51,525 --> 01:18:54,722
You should totally
mail me your number sometime.

1273
01:18:54,795 --> 01:18:56,319
Okay.

1274
01:18:56,397 --> 01:18:59,298
Just give it to me. I have a great memory.

1275
01:18:59,867 --> 01:19:01,425
Where are my envelopes?

1276
01:19:01,502 --> 01:19:05,302
Oh, you dropped them, but I got it,
and they're gonna be mailed right out.

1277
01:19:05,373 --> 01:19:07,603
Oh, thank you so much.

1278
01:19:07,675 --> 01:19:11,839
- Okay, my number's 7-6...
- Anyways, it was great meeting you, Nelly.

1279
01:19:12,546 --> 01:19:14,878
Oh, but my name is Lilly, actually.

1280
01:19:14,949 --> 01:19:16,541
Yeah, whatever.

1281
01:19:17,551 --> 01:19:18,779
Bye.

1282
01:19:20,955 --> 01:19:22,820
Now can I see your pizzanties?

1283
01:19:22,890 --> 01:19:23,982
No.

1284
01:19:35,369 --> 01:19:36,666
I don't get it.

1285
01:19:36,737 --> 01:19:39,001
Why didn't anyone show up?

1286
01:19:40,508 --> 01:19:43,136
You guys, come here and look at this.

1287
01:19:48,049 --> 01:19:51,177
I'm Ashley. Come on in.
Nice to meet you guys.

1288
01:19:55,423 --> 01:19:57,687
You did send out the invitations,
didn't you?

1289
01:19:57,758 --> 01:19:59,020
Yes.

1290
01:20:00,027 --> 01:20:01,585
But there was this boy there.

1291
01:20:01,662 --> 01:20:04,130
And I never talked to a boy before.
You know?

1292
01:20:04,198 --> 01:20:06,758
And he distracted me. Just for a minute.

1293
01:20:06,834 --> 01:20:09,166
And then I saw him talking to Ashley.

1294
01:20:09,236 --> 01:20:12,205
And they knew each other. I could tell
by the way that they talked, and...

1295
01:20:12,273 --> 01:20:13,501
And...

1296
01:20:15,609 --> 01:20:17,008
I'm sorry.

1297
01:20:28,989 --> 01:20:30,957
<i>People, all right. That's enough. Let's go.</i>

1298
01:20:31,025 --> 01:20:33,994
<i>We're done. We're shooting Miss November,
not Miss December. Let's do this.</i>

1299
01:20:34,061 --> 01:20:36,689
<i>Give me the fog. Wind, let's go.
Music, let's go.</i>

1300
01:20:36,764 --> 01:20:40,359
<i>Let's shoot this. Miss November.
Immortality! Let's go!</i>

1301
01:20:41,168 --> 01:20:43,898
<i>All right, here we go. It's Shelley time.
Come on, Shelley, it's so hot.</i>

1302
01:20:43,971 --> 01:20:46,599
<i>Oh, yeah. Sexy.
Sell it, Shelley. Oh, my gosh.</i>

1303
01:20:46,674 --> 01:20:48,471
<i>You're gorgeous, Shelley. So hot!</i>

1304
01:20:48,542 --> 01:20:51,033
<i>Come on, work it, Shelley!
Come on, let's see some...</i>

1305
01:20:51,112 --> 01:20:52,136
<i>Shelley?</i>

1306
01:20:52,213 --> 01:20:54,977
<i>Stop. Stop the fog, Dave.
Barry, hold the wind, please.</i>

1307
01:20:55,049 --> 01:20:57,847
<i>What's wrong, babe?
You okay? You sad? Sad monkey?</i>

1308
01:20:57,918 --> 01:20:59,715
I don't think I'm your Miss November.

1309
01:20:59,787 --> 01:21:01,118
<i>What?</i>

1310
01:21:02,590 --> 01:21:04,023
I'm sorry.

1311
01:21:05,793 --> 01:21:08,921
<i>Shelley, wait. Shelley.
Shelley, come on. Shelley...</i>

1312
01:21:08,996 --> 01:21:10,896
<i>Is she serious?</i>

1313
01:21:10,965 --> 01:21:12,956
<i>Shelley! Shell-monkey!</i>

1314
01:21:13,033 --> 01:21:15,558
<i>Should we take a shower
and talk about it? Shelley!</i>

1315
01:21:22,743 --> 01:21:24,210
Natalie?

1316
01:21:24,278 --> 01:21:27,372
Oh, my gosh. How did you find me?

1317
01:21:27,448 --> 01:21:30,645
Oh, just... A little bird told me.

1318
01:21:30,718 --> 01:21:32,276
What bird?

1319
01:21:32,353 --> 01:21:34,844
Marvin called us. I thought...

1320
01:21:34,922 --> 01:21:36,549
We didn't think you liked us anymore.

1321
01:21:36,624 --> 01:21:40,060
Oh, my gosh, no. I've missed you so much.

1322
01:21:40,127 --> 01:21:42,595
Oh, hi, girls. Oh, my gosh.

1323
01:21:42,663 --> 01:21:44,563
You guys look beautiful!

1324
01:21:44,632 --> 01:21:46,998
Oh, I've missed you guys so much.

1325
01:21:47,067 --> 01:21:48,898
You're the best housemother
anyone's ever had.

1326
01:21:48,969 --> 01:21:51,164
I'm really sorry for what I said to you.

1327
01:21:51,238 --> 01:21:52,762
I know. We really miss you, Shelley.

1328
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:54,171
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1329
01:21:54,275 --> 01:21:57,802
So, how'd the rest of rush go?
Did you guys get your pledges?

1330
01:21:57,878 --> 01:22:01,245
Zeta had a ton of people interested,
don't get me wrong. Thanks to you.

1331
01:22:01,315 --> 01:22:04,443
But nobody showed up
because Ashley stole all of our bids.

1332
01:22:04,518 --> 01:22:07,180
No. So the house is gone?

1333
01:22:07,254 --> 01:22:08,551
They'll make it official today

1334
01:22:08,622 --> 01:22:11,352
at the Panhellenic Council meeting
this afternoon.

1335
01:22:11,425 --> 01:22:13,222
So there's still a chance.

1336
01:22:13,294 --> 01:22:14,318
Shelley, it's too late.

1337
01:22:14,395 --> 01:22:16,829
I mean, I don't think there's anything
that we can do.

1338
01:22:16,897 --> 01:22:20,025
Natalie! Together we can do anything!

1339
01:22:21,302 --> 01:22:23,998
<i>Today's meeting is tinged with sadness.</i>

1340
01:22:24,505 --> 01:22:29,135
<i>Unfortunately, not all of us will be
returning next year.</i>

1341
01:22:30,010 --> 01:22:35,038
<i>Yes, that's true. So with that said,
that brings us to our last order of business.</i>

1342
01:22:37,051 --> 01:22:38,382
Stop!

1343
01:22:38,452 --> 01:22:39,612
Oh, dear.

1344
01:22:39,687 --> 01:22:41,780
We're here to save our house.

1345
01:22:41,856 --> 01:22:45,485
I don't know how this
big meeting stuff works, but I just...

1346
01:22:45,559 --> 01:22:47,083
<i>Enough with the freak show.</i>

1347
01:22:47,161 --> 01:22:51,063
<i>What I was saying,
before I was so rudely interrupted, is that...</i>

1348
01:22:51,131 --> 01:22:53,122
Hold on! Wait.

1349
01:22:56,303 --> 01:22:58,362
I have something to say.

1350
01:23:06,013 --> 01:23:08,413
Shelley, say something.

1351
01:23:08,482 --> 01:23:10,211
I'm allergic to erythromycin.

1352
01:23:10,284 --> 01:23:14,345
<i>Oh, for God's sake, Dean Simmons.
Enough is enough. Do something.</i>

1353
01:23:14,421 --> 01:23:18,585
<i>Shelley? The council has come here today
to really finalize this, so...</i>

1354
01:23:18,659 --> 01:23:23,153
No! No! This is germane to our predicament.

1355
01:23:23,230 --> 01:23:27,633
<i>Oh, well, as long as it's germane.
Please continue.</i>

1356
01:23:27,701 --> 01:23:29,692
Just give her a minute.

1357
01:23:31,572 --> 01:23:34,473
I'm allergic to erythromycin.

1358
01:23:35,809 --> 01:23:40,007
I took it once when I had a cold.
I was 16, and it gave me itching.

1359
01:23:40,748 --> 01:23:44,946
I mean, everything itched.
My legs, my arms, my earlobes.

1360
01:23:45,019 --> 01:23:48,182
And other stuff, too, but I can't say,
because I'm live on the air right now,

1361
01:23:48,255 --> 01:23:50,655
and you can't say "ass cheeks," right?

1362
01:23:50,724 --> 01:23:52,214
<i>You just did.</i>

1363
01:23:52,927 --> 01:23:55,725
But I said it kind of quietly, I think.

1364
01:23:57,765 --> 01:24:02,828
But besides the itching,
the erythromycin also made my skin glow.

1365
01:24:03,804 --> 01:24:06,568
It gave me, like, this glowing tan.

1366
01:24:06,640 --> 01:24:09,473
And I suddenly felt like another person.

1367
01:24:10,110 --> 01:24:11,543
Different.

1368
01:24:12,279 --> 01:24:13,610
Better.

1369
01:24:14,348 --> 01:24:16,646
Prettier, I guess.

1370
01:24:16,717 --> 01:24:19,311
- What's your name?
- Michelle.

1371
01:24:20,087 --> 01:24:21,213
Michelle.

1372
01:24:21,322 --> 01:24:24,052
Michelle, do you know that feeling
that I'm talking about?

1373
01:24:24,124 --> 01:24:25,318
Where you suddenly feel pretty

1374
01:24:25,392 --> 01:24:28,020
and, next thing you know,
you feel better about yourself?

1375
01:24:28,095 --> 01:24:30,495
Well, that was what was happening to me.

1376
01:24:30,564 --> 01:24:33,829
My allergic reaction made me feel pretty,

1377
01:24:33,901 --> 01:24:38,736
and so I ignored all the bad side effects,
because suddenly people were talking to me

1378
01:24:38,806 --> 01:24:40,671
and they were noticing me.

1379
01:24:40,741 --> 01:24:43,835
And even though I was itching like crazy,

1380
01:24:43,911 --> 01:24:46,709
it was worth it to feel accepted.

1381
01:24:47,681 --> 01:24:51,947
And so I couldn't wait to get a cold
so I could take my erythromycin.

1382
01:24:54,521 --> 01:24:59,322
But underneath that beautiful, glowing skin,
I still had that cold.

1383
01:25:00,961 --> 01:25:03,429
Well, that's a meteor.

1384
01:25:04,465 --> 01:25:06,399
<i>The word is "Metaphor."</i>

1385
01:25:07,434 --> 01:25:09,595
<i>Can you really be that dumb?</i>

1386
01:25:10,371 --> 01:25:12,305
She's not dumb.

1387
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:14,803
Thank you, Natalie.

1388
01:25:16,744 --> 01:25:19,941
And, Mrs. Hagstrom, I meant "Meteor."

1389
01:25:21,148 --> 01:25:24,675
It flashes by and burns bright,
but then it disappears.

1390
01:25:25,719 --> 01:25:28,620
And that was what was happening to me.

1391
01:25:28,689 --> 01:25:31,123
The real me just disappeared.

1392
01:25:32,659 --> 01:25:34,650
<i>Is anyone buying this?</i>

1393
01:25:35,696 --> 01:25:38,062
I am not an expert speech-giver.

1394
01:25:39,466 --> 01:25:43,129
But I do know that one day,
when your looks are gone,

1395
01:25:43,203 --> 01:25:46,798
if everything you have is based on looks,
well, then you've got nothing.

1396
01:25:46,874 --> 01:25:50,105
You need your friends
and your family by your side,

1397
01:25:50,177 --> 01:25:53,977
to love you for who you are,
not what you look like.

1398
01:25:54,048 --> 01:25:57,814
At the Zeta house, our new motto is,
"Be who you are."

1399
01:25:57,885 --> 01:25:59,819
Because we're a family.

1400
01:26:00,454 --> 01:26:04,254
We're a family that loves you on the inside.

1401
01:26:05,459 --> 01:26:10,658
So we need you to stand forward
and be a part of that family.

1402
01:26:11,498 --> 01:26:16,094
We need 30 people right now
to stand forward and pledge Zeta!

1403
01:26:16,170 --> 01:26:19,571
Hey, honey!
You had me at "itchy ass cheeks." I'm in.

1404
01:26:19,640 --> 01:26:21,608
Me too! Me too!

1405
01:26:21,675 --> 01:26:22,972
Me too!

1406
01:26:23,977 --> 01:26:25,535
- I'll be a Zeta!
- Me, too!

1407
01:26:25,612 --> 01:26:27,409
- Me, too.
- I'll pledge!

1408
01:26:27,481 --> 01:26:31,042
- Six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11!
- Me, too!

1409
01:26:31,118 --> 01:26:33,985
- I'll pledge!
- Twelve! Thirteen! Come on, we need 30.

1410
01:26:34,054 --> 01:26:35,521
- I'll do it!
- Fourteen.

1411
01:26:35,589 --> 01:26:37,819
- Get your hand down.
- Fifteen. Sixteen.

1412
01:26:37,891 --> 01:26:40,860
Seventeen, 18, 19, 20.
Excellent! Twenty-one!

1413
01:26:40,928 --> 01:26:43,795
- Twenty-two. Twenty-three. Come on!
- I'll be in Zeta!

1414
01:26:43,864 --> 01:26:45,889
- Twenty-four, 25.
- Up here! Pick me!

1415
01:26:45,966 --> 01:26:48,093
Twenty-six, on top.
Thank you. Twenty-seven.

1416
01:26:48,168 --> 01:26:50,534
New pledger, right there.
Come on, two more!

1417
01:26:50,604 --> 01:26:52,196
Twenty-eight, 29!

1418
01:26:52,272 --> 01:26:54,502
One more. Just need one more.
Come on, everybody.

1419
01:26:54,575 --> 01:26:58,136
One more. One more. Get your hand up.
Come on! Be a Zeta.

1420
01:26:58,212 --> 01:26:59,509
Come on!

1421
01:26:59,580 --> 01:27:02,879
Come on! Come on, one more!
Just need one more Zeta.

1422
01:27:02,950 --> 01:27:04,975
One more, one more. Come on!

1423
01:27:05,052 --> 01:27:07,452
Pound the gavel!
Why are you dragging this out?

1424
01:27:07,521 --> 01:27:08,920
There's nobody else! It's over.

1425
01:27:08,989 --> 01:27:11,480
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha on you, Zetas.

1426
01:27:14,328 --> 01:27:15,727
Wait!

1427
01:27:16,763 --> 01:27:18,856
There's one more new Zeta!

1428
01:27:28,208 --> 01:27:29,675
No. Sorry.

1429
01:27:30,444 --> 01:27:33,845
Can't be a baby pledging a sorority.
You gotta be a student.

1430
01:27:33,914 --> 01:27:35,211
That's right!

1431
01:27:35,282 --> 01:27:38,376
Rules are rules. Oh, well. Bye-bye.

1432
01:27:38,452 --> 01:27:40,579
Time to pound that gavel.
Meeting adjourned.

1433
01:27:40,654 --> 01:27:43,487
Dunzo. Pound that gavel, Dean.

1434
01:27:43,557 --> 01:27:47,084
I'm really very sorry, girls.
I know how hard you've worked for this.

1435
01:27:47,161 --> 01:27:49,129
It hurts me to do this, but I...

1436
01:27:49,196 --> 01:27:52,461
Stop! I would like to pledge Zeta.

1437
01:27:53,066 --> 01:27:54,294
What?

1438
01:27:54,368 --> 01:27:56,859
I like everything that Shelley said.

1439
01:27:56,937 --> 01:27:58,996
Are you out of your mind?

1440
01:28:00,240 --> 01:28:04,700
And, God, do you know
how sick to death I am of you?

1441
01:28:04,778 --> 01:28:06,837
Of Phi lota Mu?

1442
01:28:06,914 --> 01:28:09,348
I've been in Phi lota Mu hell!

1443
01:28:09,416 --> 01:28:11,407
I want to be a Zeta.

1444
01:28:14,988 --> 01:28:16,216
No!

1445
01:28:22,296 --> 01:28:24,594
Okay, so Zetas keep their house.

1446
01:28:24,665 --> 01:28:26,360
Meeting adjourned.

1447
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,992
Now, go study something.

1448
01:28:34,208 --> 01:28:36,142
What are we supposed to do now?

1449
01:28:36,210 --> 01:28:38,007
Let's start with this.

1450
01:28:46,587 --> 01:28:48,885
Oh, I love my weird home.

1451
01:28:48,956 --> 01:28:50,184
Things that I like!

1452
01:28:50,257 --> 01:28:52,953
Ottoman! Oh, I love you, ottoman.

1453
01:28:53,660 --> 01:28:56,185
- This house is so nice!
- I know.

1454
01:28:56,263 --> 01:28:58,288
I mean, so cool.

1455
01:28:58,365 --> 01:29:01,391
- Hey, do you want me to show you upstairs?
- Yes! Show me, show me, show me.

1456
01:29:01,468 --> 01:29:03,129
This is so great.

1457
01:29:03,203 --> 01:29:05,797
Everything worked out so perfectly.

1458
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:09,400
Well, not perfectly.

1459
01:29:09,476 --> 01:29:14,504
I mean, I messed up things with Oliver
because I moved to Peru and left him a note.

1460
01:29:14,581 --> 01:29:17,379
Well, Shelley,
you didn't really move to Peru.

1461
01:29:17,451 --> 01:29:19,681
I know that, but he doesn't.

1462
01:29:22,055 --> 01:29:23,420
Oliver.

1463
01:29:25,192 --> 01:29:29,891
I was literally just talking about you.
How did you know that I got back?

1464
01:29:30,897 --> 01:29:33,593
Let's just say a little bird told me.

1465
01:29:34,835 --> 01:29:37,269
I gotta meet this frickin' bird!

1466
01:29:38,538 --> 01:29:40,130
It's me, Shell.

1467
01:29:40,941 --> 01:29:43,876
I'm the bird. I called Oliver.

1468
01:29:46,013 --> 01:29:47,412
Thank you.

1469
01:29:48,015 --> 01:29:50,882
It's so great to have such nice friends.

1470
01:29:53,153 --> 01:29:57,112
And, Oliver, I have to admit,
I never went to Peru.

1471
01:29:57,190 --> 01:29:59,454
- I know.
- Thank you.

1472
01:29:59,526 --> 01:30:01,118
You're welcome.

1473
01:30:01,762 --> 01:30:03,730
<i>And I was in Playboy.</i>

1474
01:30:03,797 --> 01:30:06,698
I know that, too. And I don't care.

1475
01:30:08,302 --> 01:30:10,600
I would like to try this again.

1476
01:30:10,671 --> 01:30:15,131
Except this time,
no manhole covers or bubble gum.

1477
01:30:15,942 --> 01:30:19,173
You know, just see where this goes.

1478
01:30:19,713 --> 01:30:20,907
Yes.

1479
01:30:21,782 --> 01:30:24,114
- I'd like that.
- Great.

1480
01:30:26,953 --> 01:30:28,420
Oliver.

1481
01:30:28,488 --> 01:30:29,785
Oliver.

1482
01:30:30,624 --> 01:30:33,821
- I'm Shelley.
- Nice to meet you again, Shelley.

1483
01:30:35,162 --> 01:30:38,222
<i>Dear Hef, everything worked out!</i>

1484
01:30:38,298 --> 01:30:41,734
<i>We got 330 new Zeta sisters,
and the house was saved.</i>

1485
01:30:43,337 --> 01:30:45,805
<i>And Oliver and I started dating again.</i>

1486
01:30:45,872 --> 01:30:48,773
<i>Oliver is kind and sweet and when we kiss,</i>

1487
01:30:48,842 --> 01:30:51,470
<i>I see stars and he sees fireworks.</i>

1488
01:30:51,545 --> 01:30:53,809
<i>And he says that means that we're in love,
and he's right!</i>

1489
01:30:53,880 --> 01:30:55,313
<i>Because otherwise, when we kiss</i>

1490
01:30:55,382 --> 01:30:58,351
<i>we'd see stuff like pencils
and empty ketchup bottles.</i>

1491
01:30:58,418 --> 01:31:01,876
<i>Oh, and the Zetas decided to throw
a big party in my honor,</i>

1492
01:31:01,955 --> 01:31:04,082
<i>and I felt just like that girl
from the storybook.</i>

1493
01:31:04,157 --> 01:31:05,988
<i>You know the one. What's her name?</i>

1494
01:31:06,059 --> 01:31:08,220
<i>Oh, yeah. Cinderella.</i>

1495
01:31:19,773 --> 01:31:22,003
<i>Where my Zetas at? Where my Zetas at?</i>

1496
01:31:22,075 --> 01:31:24,373
<i>Where my, where my...
Where my Zetas at?</i>

1497
01:31:24,444 --> 01:31:26,674
<i>Hands up now</i>

1498
01:31:26,747 --> 01:31:28,374
<i>Push it up now</i>

1499
01:31:29,583 --> 01:31:31,847
<i>I know what boys like</i>

1500
01:31:31,918 --> 01:31:34,113
<i>Cute smiles and heels high</i>

1501
01:31:34,187 --> 01:31:36,451
<i>I tempt the hello</i>

1502
01:31:36,523 --> 01:31:38,684
<i>While I say bye-bye</i>

1503
01:31:38,759 --> 01:31:40,989
<i>I know they want me</i>

1504
01:31:41,094 --> 01:31:43,324
<i>They try to fake it</i>

1505
01:31:43,397 --> 01:31:45,661
<i>But they just end up</i>

1506
01:31:45,732 --> 01:31:47,723
<i>Intimidated!</i>

1507
01:31:50,871 --> 01:31:53,169
<i>It ain't that hard to see</i>

1508
01:31:53,240 --> 01:31:55,140
<i>I know you're feelin' me</i>

1509
01:31:55,208 --> 01:31:56,937
<i>I know what I want</i>

1510
01:31:57,010 --> 01:31:59,274
<i>If I think you'll give me</i>

1511
01:31:59,346 --> 01:32:01,473
<i>I might let you</i>

1512
01:32:01,548 --> 01:32:03,914
<i>Unconditionally, yeah</i>

1513
01:32:03,984 --> 01:32:06,179
<i>I might let you</i>

1514
01:32:06,253 --> 01:32:08,448
<i>If you're on my level</i>

1515
01:32:08,522 --> 01:32:10,319
