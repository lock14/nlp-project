[man] You ever wake up
in the morning and think,
"Man, life is good.
I mean, it just can't
get any better than this. "
It's all beautiful and perfect
and wonderful and amazing,
and then, one day,
that one thing happens
that changes everything.
[bomb whistling]
- I'm pregnant.
- [man] That's only one test.
[man sighs] Oh, boy.
[Morgan] What kind of a world
am I bringing a kid into?
They say the most important job
a father has is to keep his baby safe.
But how am I going to do that?
I can cover the electrical sockets,
or childproof Mommy's pill bottles,
but that's just inside the house.
- What about out there?
- [sirens wailing]
There's cults, muggers,
drugs, violence.
Not to mention all of the predators
now lurking about.
I could move from the East Village
to a family friendly
neighborhood in Brooklyn,
but is that enough
to keep my child safe?
- And what about the big things?
- [thunder rumbles]
Things like hurricanes,
earthquakes or tsunamis?
And that's just that mean, old,
Mother Nature.
What about the really big things?
Things we should really be afraid of.
Like the most wanted man on the planet.
What about him?
We've got the strongest military,
sneakiest spies and coolest technology
in the entire world,
but we can't find one man hiding in
Afghanibaluchapakiwaziristan?
[ MC Hammer: U Can't Touch This]
[man] After 9/1 1, I thought
some satellite would
shoot a laser down onto the earth,
fry up an omelet bin Laden
and save us all.
But that wasn't the case.
I know, maybe he's dead.
But maybe he's alive.
Maybe he's on dialysis.
Maybe he's a nine foot bionic ninja with
X-ray vision and the power of flight.
All I know is that
in the last six years,
there've been more acts
of terrorism, worldwide,
than in 20 years leading up to it.
Today, there are known terrorist cells
in more than 100 countries
around the world.
By the time my kid's out of diapers,
everyone's gonna be a terrorist.
Nowhere's gonna be safe.
With Operation Special Delivery
only 1 9 weeks away,
I just can't sit around and do nothing.
If the CIA and the FBI can't find him,
and I'm going to make this world safe
for my child, it's time for a new plan.
If I've learned anything
from big budget action movies,
it's that complicated global problems
are best solved by one lonely guy
crazy enough to think he can fix
everything before the credits roll.
And I'm going to find out
once and for all:
Where in the world is Osama bin Laden?
[ Jon Spurney:
Where in the World is Osama bin Laden?]
[all hollering]
[hooting]
Moustache ride.
Reign of Terror!
I'm gonna get you, Osama been hiding.
[Morgan] I wanted to talk to you because
I'm getting ready to do a lot of travel.
I wanted to see if I'm
going to need any shots, anything...
Where are you going to be going?
We're going to go look
for Osama bin Laden.
OK. [laughs]
You'll probably find him.
Um, you're going to need a whole
bunch of shots and prescriptions.
- You want to do it, want to go for it?
- I'm going to need it all, right?
- How many shots am I getting?
- Diphtheria, tetanus, polio.
Typhoid, meningitis, hepatitis A and B.
This one I must tell you about.
This is your yellow fever.
About one in one million people
who get the yellow fever shot,
get a very, very bad reaction.
They get multi-system organ failure.
There are six reported cases or more,
maybe seven or eight.
And about four of them died.
[Morgan] Going to need more than shots
to keep me safe
in the places I'm heading to.
[man] This is reality-based
personal protection,
teaching you how to survive explosions,
small arms attacks, sniper attacks,
chemical attacks. We cover it all.
We're going to simulate
a hand grenade attack.
Boom! You would have been killed.
I'll show you how to survive.
The first thing you want to do
is turn away from the grenade and dive.
You're in a perfect position. This is
going to save your life by 98 percent.
When someone's head explodes,
that's what it looks like.
Even though it's tragic, we can't focus
on this, we got to think about survival.
Look at the wall there. What do you see?
- [Morgan] I see blood.
- [Wagner] OK, good.
We have the "blood splatter."
How do we determine where the sniper
is at, based on our situation here?
Hold up a hat on a stick.
If I'm in a restaurant,
I don't want to sit in the middle.
If a gunman came, where is he
most likely to hit? You're dead here.
This is what we call the "fatal funnel."
You want to stay behind that line,
you want to stay off the wall.
You're dead here.
You're dead here.
Any time you leave your vehicle,
you gotta assume, in dangerous places,
someone could plant a bomb
on your vehicle. You're dead here.
- [both laughing]
- You're dead here.
Here's what I recommend,
you go around the corner,
and then you can pull it open,
and if it doesn't go boom,
you can go check it out.
Gonna be the most paranoid person
in the Middle East.
Maybe that's a good thing.
Because if I'm going to find Osama,
I'm traveling to scary places. In the
last year, the State Department issued
over 100 warnings about
traveling to the Middle East.
Mainly because Americans are now bigger
targets for kidnapping and murder.
[Wagner] Now we're going to have a
little classroom time about kidnapping.
Here are some basics
of surviving as a hostage.
You got to accept it and start planning
on how you're going to survive it.
Speak only if spoken to.
- Is this the crew's, the cameraman's?
- No.
[Wagner] Don't provoke the captors.
Don't stare at them.
Don't have a harsh tone of voice.
Don't be argumentative.
Don't have an attitude.
These people are in control, not you.
[man] This is not a fucking game.
[Wagner] Especially when you're
in Baghdad, Kabul, or you're in Turkey,
this stuff is going on daily,
and you gotta be prepared for it.
I'm usually a pretty calm person
when it comes to...
...crazy shit happening around me.
But that's a whole other level of crazy.
[guitar riffs play]
We wage a war to save
a civilization itself.
[guitar riffs play]
They hate us, our country. They hate
the liberties for which we stand.
[guitar riffs play]
Until you catch the chicken,
you don't have the chicken.
- Go, go, go!
- [ Jon Spurney: No Pain, No Gain]
Want you to get used to
the sound of the language.
- [both making consonant sounds]
- Oh, good, Wow.
Go for the eyes. The eyes!
Are you going to convert
to Muslim or not?
Shoot him, shoot him.
I recommend you wear the clothes.
Maybe you can hit
the tanning salon a little bit.
- [shots firing]
- [yelling]
- Grenade!
- [screaming]
Somebody said I should
grow my beard out?
Yeah, for you. Because you
obviously look very foreign.
- Look at this area. Much bigger, right?
- This guy is probably alive.
[speaking foreign language]
You could have a situation where
a device explodes and it gets on you.
Oh, fuck!
I brought you these outfits.
Hopefully, it keeps you safe.
This is a normal reaction. He's fine.
How do I say, "Don't take me,
take the cameraman?"
He's alive!
You have to know the way
an lslamic terrorist thinks.
[Morgan] Jim's right.
I need to learn how Osama thinks.
To find a fox,
you need to think like a fox.
I need to get inside his head
and learn what makes him tick.
I need to explore
the world he comes from.
Meet the people who influenced him.
Visit the places that shaped him
into who he is today.
And, most of all,
I need to try to understand
what drives an Osama bin Laden to begin
with. I know just the place to start.
[beeping]
[ Malik Audouane: Theme from Shaft]
Egypt is the birthplace
of one of the heaviest hitters
in the world of terrorism.
Ayman Al-Zawahiri.
He's Al-Qaeda's Team Manager
and Osama's personal mentor.
His stats are pretty impressive.
He was a member of the
Muslim Brotherhood at the age of 14.
He's a life-long follower
of Sayyid Qutb,
the man credited with creating
modern day Islamic fundamentalism,
is currently the number two
of Al-Qaeda, and...
...he's a Gemini.
And I got a tip where
to find his uncle, Mahfouz Azzam.
If he can tell me where the A-man is,
odds are Osama won't be too far away.
- Hello.
- Hello. Mahfouz? [speaks Arabic]
- It's nice to see you. Welcome.
- Nice to see you.
- Thank you.
- Please.
- It's a beautiful day today. Very nice.
- Yeah.
- [Morgan] So do you know where he is?
- [man in Arabic] No.
Where do you think he is?
[in Arabic] If you learn where
he is, I beg you, let me know.
I just want to make sure he is OK.
He won't let me know by phone
because you kill people with the phone.
The Russians killed the president
of Chechnya with the phone,
and you Americans have killed
people with the phone.
This, a telephone,
has become a lethal weapon!
And every month my bank account
gets killed by my phone.
- [laughing]
- Which makes it even worse.
So, if you knew where he was,
you wouldn't turn him in
for the $25,000,000?
[laughs]
I would like to tell you something,
the hungry
who cannot find bread to eat
in Afghanistan
they wouldn't accept
these $25 million of yours
to turn in a Muslim they know
is waging jihad for them.
So he's in Afghanistan?
- You say so.
- You said so. You just told me.
America says so. America says so.
- Do you think he's in Afghanistan?
- America says.
So if Al-Zawahiri and Osama bin Laden
just disappeared tomorrow,
would things change?
The seed that was sown by America,
a seed of spitefulness, hate,
aggression and killing,
cannot disappear in the short term.
There has to be another foreign
policy to uproot this seed.
[Morgan] It's easy to criticize
American foreign policy,
with the second most wanted
terrorist in the family.
I should find regular folks
who might be more objective.
What do you guys hear about Americans?
[in Arabic] The Americans
are known to be fighting
the Egyptians, Palestinians and lraqis.
- We're fighting you?
- [laughing]
- Yes.
- Really? I didn't even know that.
What are we fighting the Egyptians for?
[speaking Arabic]
You want to occupy Egypt.
[Morgan] Do we? Why?
We're not that well versed in politics
but that's what we hear on TV and stuff.
What do you think about America?
[in Arabic] They are good people, but
we reject the American foreign policy.
[Morgan] How can he be against
American foreign policy?
Egypt is one of our best friends in the
region and in the global war on terror.
At the same time, it was home to five
of the founding fathers of Al-Qaeda.
The guy who tried to blow up
the World Trade Center in '93,
and the ringleader
of the 9/1 1 hijackings.
Maybe university students could tell me
why Osama's making so many friends here.
It's about oppression, because
Egypt is a developing country,
so, like, the people who are
oppressed are kind of more...
So it develops more terrorists,
and that's it.
[in Arabic] These would be
the minority, the rotten type.
Every society has the same.
Every society has good and bad.
In Egypt, people have no freedom.
And they try and prove to the government
that they have freedom, deserve freedom,
by committing terrorist attacks.
Did you vote in the last
presidential election?
- No.
- No.
- You weren't old enough yet?
- It's not that.
I don't believe in it.
I know it's rigged.
I know that Hosni Mubarak
would have won anyway.
They call this a democratic country,
but it's not.
In Egypt, if a president wants
to stay in power, he'll stay in power.
[applause]
[Morgan] And Hosni Mubarak has
been in power for more than 26 years.
The United States has got a close
and meaningful relationship with Egypt.
[cheering]
This relationship is a cornerstone
for our policy in the Middle East.
[Morgan] Policy that includes
giving Mubarak an aid package,
while looking the other way
as he uses riot police and hired thugs
armed with sticks, knives,
swords and Molotov cocktails
to keep the opposition
from voting on election day.
You might say about Mubarak the same
thing FDR said about another dictator.
He may be a son of a bitch,
but he's our son of a bitch.
[Morgan] See, we've had a policy
of propping up dictators
for more than 50 years now.
When the Cold War started heating up,
we decided to do what it took
to stop communism from taking over.
And the United States started mixing
with a rougher crowd.
Hmm!
In 1 953, the CIA helped the Shah of
Iran overthrow the Iranian government,
to become their supreme ruler.
Sure, the Shah tortured or killed
anyone who publicly disagreed with him.
Even went as far as shoving broken glass
up the nether regions of critics.
But he totally hated Communism.
Now, he was a son of a bitch,
but he was our son of a bitch.
The Shah kept Iran
in our corner until 1 979,
when Ayatollah Khomeini's
Islamic revolution swept to power,
and held 52 Americans hostage
for 15 months.
That's when we made friends
with Saddam Hussein over in Iraq.
Now, he was an SOB too,
but for ten years,
while he was fighting the Iranians,
he was our SOB.
In fact, by the mid-'80s, we had sons of
bitches all the way from Latin America
to the Middle East, but, hey,
pimping freedom ain't easy.
[hip-hop music plays]
[Morgan] We needed to keep
our SOBs happy and on our side.
So we provided them with tanks,
guns, planes and more money.
Today we give Egypt more than 2 billion
dollars a year in weapons and aid.
Sure, there's torture, murder
and rampant political corruption,
but somewhere along the way
we decided that,
in order to protect our own freedom,
it was all right to sacrifice
the freedom of others.
Does lack of democracy, human rights,
in countries like Egypt
encourage people to get involved
in extremist radical groups?
Of course. There's no doubt about this.
It's the one thing that
I agree with George W. Bush about.
That people join terrorist organizations
because there is
no other way to be active.
The threat of terrorism created the
climate of fear that is being exploited
by the Mubarak regime
and by George Bush.
We're going through
a very difficult time now.
I mean, we have terrorists on one side,
and opportunist, exploitative regimes
on the other side.
The U.S. can no longer
claim the moral ground.
People have learned to expect a lot
less from the U.S. than they used to.
[Arabic music plays]
[man in Arabic] The United States is
the main problem in the region, frankly.
We love the American people, but
we hate the American government.
[in Arabic] We pray to God
to destroy you
because of what's happening.
[Morgan] America's filled with people
who want people to live peacefully,
to co-exist together, just like me.
OK, I don't want you to be there
when it happens.
Have a smell.
[Morgan] You know, being in the States,
all we get on the news
are the crazy nuts
that like to scream, "Death to you!"
And so you're like,
"Oh, man. Go get them."
But we've been in Egypt for a week now,
talking to people, who are real people,
just like you and me.
One after another after another
everybody said,
"This government's corrupt
and it's backed by the U. S. "
- [chanting]
- It's hard for me to see how damaged
the image of the country that
I love and care about has become.
[phone rings]
- [Morgan] Hello?
- I got your postcard from Egypt today.
Oh, nice. You sound good.
I am good. Just promise you'll be here
when it's really important. OK?
I promise.
[woman] He has to be back by the
first week of November, because I'm due
the end of November, early December.
And, if he misses that,
I'm going to be so upset.
And he's going to be upset.
But, also, he's going to these places
that are so dangerous.
And I don't want him to miss anything.
And I don't want him to get hurt.
[man singing in Arabic]
[man in Arabic] While we are
living in these troubled times,
we need to be merciful.
So get mercy through praises
and prayers upon Him...
...because He is mercy.
And He puts compassion in your heart.
As a Muslim I am taught
that God has honored humankind.
He did not say he honored Muslims and
everyone else is a second class citizen.
[speaking Arabic]
We have honored the children of heaven.
[singing in Arabic]
[man] Your average Egyptian's struggling
like your average American
to make ends meet,
to get a decent job, provide
for his family, educate his kids.
The same concerns all over.
[Morgan] Torek is an Egyptian-American
studying law at Al Azhar University.
He's a new dad and wants
the world's view of Islam
to change for the sake
of his young son.
[Torek] We need to rectify this,
Muslims are over one fifth
of the world population.
That's a lot of people. It's not
some Polynesian island somewhere.
- [Morgan laughs]
- That's a lot of people!
If four-fifths of the world
are scared of one-fifth,
what kind of civilization and humanity
are we gonna have?
- [laughing]
- [speaking Arabic]
Now they're going to think
all we do is pray.
- Even the kids!
- I'm working on the voice-over.
From a very young age,
they start manipulating the children.
[laughing]
[Torek] We need to differentiate between
extreme factions in a population,
and the regular,
vast majority of people.
What do you think of the War on Terror?
It's a bogus term.
I don't think it means anything.
I think some guy
that had too much to drink in the
Pentagon, one night, came up with that.
- Dude, I got a great idea.
- A war on terrorism.
We had a war on drugs.
We didn't win that, either.
[Torek] But is it really
a war on terror?
Have we eradicated terror?
Or are we exporting terror?
I think that... Unfortunately,
I think that we're exporting it.
I think that we lit the flame on a bomb.
[Morgan] The bomb Torek is speaking of
is the explosive rise
in terrorist attacks
during the last seven years.
Al-Qaeda has now become
a global franchise,
serving up an unhealthy dose of j ihad
to more and more people each year.
Ooh! Can I help you?
[Morgan] Despite the U. S. spending over
$500 billion fighting the war on terror,
Al-Qaeda continues to find
new markets to expand into.
Thanks to heavy worldwide recruitment,
which included having interested people
filling out job applications,
AQ is now back to its pre-9/1 1 strength.
Two of the U. S. 's closest allies,
Spain and England,
were both attacked
by homegrown Al-Qaeda cells.
Even Muslim countries are finding
they are in Al-Qaeda's crosshairs,
often becoming the victims of terrorism
and feeling the influence
of Osama bin Laden firsthand.
[Arabic music plays]
[Morgan] Where is Osama bin Laden?
[in Arabic] He might be
somewhere here in Morocco.
[in Arabic] How should I know?
- Bin Laden? I am not a politic man.
- Yeah.
I don't know nothing about...
I'm a carpet dealer. I sell carpet.
[Morgan] How many years
has this tannery been here?
[in Arabic] Centuries.
What do you think about people
who cause violence in the name of lslam?
[in Arabic] It is not from lslam
to kill innocent people
or to blow yourself up.
I'm disgusted by that.
[Morgan] Do you ever worry that your
sons may get involved with terrorists?
We worry about that.
We don't want them to get involved
with that kind of crowd.
That's why we have to take care
of them financially.
[man in Arabic] Americans are
causing all the trouble in the world.
But... Were the...
But this is my opinion
of the American government,
not the American people.
[in Arabic] These are all
the problems that Bush created.
I heard that they want
to eradicate lslam.
[Morgan] What do you think
about Osama bin Laden?
[speaking Arabic]
[Morgan laughs] He's crazy?
[in Arabic] Osama bin Laden,
look how many people he's killed,
how many have died.
And what has he accomplished?
He's accomplished a wave
of suicide bombings in Morocco
killing more than 50 people
over the last four years.
The first attack was in May of 2003,
when recruiters outside the country came
to town and convinced 14 young men
to blow themselves up in exchange
for money and the rewards of paradise.
They all grew up on the exact same
street in the desperately poor ghetto
of Sidi Moumen.
I met journalist Aboubakr Jamai,
to find out what'd drive young men
to cause such destruction.
[Jamai] I think it's
a mix of ingredients.
And, depending on the situation,
one of the ingredients
is more important than the others.
And, these ingredients,
I think in the case of Morocco,
the socio-economic ingredient
is the most important one.
It's not a coincidence that all
of the guys who blew themselves up
in the 1 6th of May, uh, 2003,
came from this shantytown.
They were either unemployed
or had menial jobs.
And they were completely outcast
in their own society.
[Morgan] What do you think
is the solution?
[Jamai] The problem in Morocco,
with the people here,
is that we fail to give them
an economic voice and a political voice.
To me, that's the solution. Need to
give opportunity, economically speaking,
because extremism
nourishes itself from darkness.
[ Ernest Ranglin
and Baaba Maal: Haayo]
[Morgan] That evening I was invited
to dinner with Ahmed and his family,
in the same 200 square-foot house
he grew up in.
Ahmed doesn't want his children to fall
prey to the same people the bombers did.
But with a poor education system
and little money,
he fears they could be exploited.
Thank you for letting us come here.
This is a great thing.
[in Arabic] lslam obligates us to be
this way, to be brothers with everyone.
[Morgan] I'm about to have a baby in
December. Give me some fatherly advice.
You should take care of your wife.
I've got a good wife, so that's good.
If your relationship is based
on love and good values,
you will have good children.
[Morgan] Wow.
What kind of fish is that?
It's like a sardine.
It's delicious.
I'm glad. Eat with good health.
So, I want you to tell me,
what do you hope for your kids?
I want my kids to get an education.
The people who aren't educated won't
accomplish anything in their life.
How did you do in school?
- [laughter]
- She's laughing!
She teases me. Sometimes
she and the kids gang up on me.
So do I have that to look forward to?
When you have your child
they will do the same to you.
How hard is it to get
a good education living in this area?
You can't get well educated living here,
because of the poverty.
I'd like to hear your opinion. When we
hear about all these people who...
...commit acts of violence
in the name of lslam,
what are your thoughts on those people?
Those people do not belong to lslam.
Even the terrorism that happened
here was masterminded abroad.
The people who blew themselves
up were tempted,
some tempted by money
and some by Paradise.
It is much harder for this generation
than it was for my generation.
[woman in French] Violence is birthed
by the economic dead ends
that confront our youth
who happen to be Muslim
with an lslamic outlook.
How do you feel that we, as Americans,
or how do we as a world culture...
...start to end the fighting?
I believe that there is an enormous
anger with American policy.
It's too bad it's the American people
who have to pay for that anger.
And so we have the obligation
not to fail our future,
we have to reach out
to each other,
ignore official political lines
and create unofficial bridges
between civilian societies
in order to bring about change.
What were your thoughts
after 9/1 1 happened?
If it were truly
Osama bin Laden, who did that,
then he dealt us a bad hand.
He legitimized the American
presence in the Middle East.
He was the reason for the adoption
of all the anti-terrorist laws
that have pushed us further
under the yoke
of our own local political leaders.
I was astonished on many levels.
It's horrible.
[beeping]
[beeping]
[Morgan] Osama bin Laden says one
reason for the creation of Al-Qaeda
and attacks against the West,
is the existence of Israel,
America's support of her and the
treatment of the Palestinian people.
If Osama cares
about the Palestinians so much,
I wanted to see if the feeling
was mutual. If it is,
I'm sure someone
can help me narrow in on it.
[Morgan] How do you feel about
Al-Qaeda causing acts of terrorism
- in the name of the Palestinian people?
- I don't agree with Al-Qaeda.
Yeah.
I'll leave that alone.
I don't agree with them at all.
It is none of their business
to do anything for us.
We can do for ourselves.
We are fighting to make our homeland
free. It's none of their business.
[Morgan] I was wondering if you
could help? Looking for Osama bin Laden.
- [man] Go to Tora Bora. No.
- Not here in Ramallah?
- No?
- They hate Osama bin Laden.
- Palestinians?
- Palestinians.
- And you know, if...
- Why do they hate him?
Because he likes blood. You know?
He is a ridiculous Muslim.
He gives a bad picture about lslam.
[Arabic hip-hop plays]
We've heard Hamas is on the
same level as Al-Qaeda. Is that true?
[in Arabic] Ours is
not a religious conflict.
We don't fight the Jews
because they are Jews.
No, we fight them
because they occupy our lands.
And Al-Qaeda, it holds
all of the West as an enemy.
But the number one reason
they say they do it
is because of the Palestinian conflict.
Because of what's happening here.
Any Arab leader, all Arab movements
have adopted the Palestinian issue
because they know the Palestinian issue
is what triggers the emotions and
nationalistic feelings
in all Arab and Muslim people.
But, at the same point, they're using
you guys as, like, this battle cry,
but they're doing nothing to help you.
That's the reality.
Without the Palestinian issue,
they won't get any attention
on the global level.
It is strategic on their part
to adopt the Palestinian issue.
[Morgan] Unbelievable how many
walls are here, the separation.
Everywhere you go there's a wall,
a fence, barbed wire.
It's not for a human being.
It's good for a zoo.
[in Arabic] If this
was happening in lsrael,
America and all the other
countries would protest it.
- The peace of life, we don't have it.
- Yeah.
And we are living in very big prison.
[in Arabic] I wish we had somebody
like Osama bin Laden in Palestine.
Just to destroy the state of lsrael.
It's a political struggle, a military
struggle. But the biggest thing is this.
All of this is about land.
Scattered through the hills
of the Palestinian West Bank,
are Israeli settlements, built to expand
the Jewish presence in the region.
How does it feel,
being overlooked by settlements?
It's not only overlooking us,
but we are always under their foot.
[in Arabic] They can come and take over
my home, where I live, by force.
What can I do? I can't do anything.
[man] Tears and blood were shed today
as Israel began the forced evacuation
of Jewish settlers from their homes.
[Morgan] The settlements
are a cause of violence
between settlers and Palestinians,
they are also a contentious issue
within Israeli politics.
With one side seeing the settlements
as another obstacle in achieving peace,
while the other sees it
as a divine right.
We Jews are the rightful owner
of this land.
- Mm-hmm.
- It was a land that was promised
to them by the Almighty, who kept
his promise and brought us back.
After we realized
there's going to be a struggle
about every centimeter of the land,
we realized we have to
settle on the outposts
to enlarge the area.
This outpost, for instance, it's...
- So is that legal to do that?
- It's illegal in the moment,
as it is in the process
of being legalized.
[Morgan] What is your thought
on the Palestinian conflict?
When we were kids, there was
this game where you play music
- and there's a circle of chairs.
- Yeah. Musical chairs.
Musical chairs. This is a bit
like a musical chair tragedy.
Somebody is left without a chair.
But everybody needs to sit somewhere.
[Morgan] Should lsraelis
move out of the settlements?
IsraeI'll have to let go
of the territories.
We are not holding the territories,
the territories are holding us.
The tragedy of this place
is that everybody knows exactly
what would be the solution in the end,
the end of the story. Two countries
that are connected, but separated.
And this is the way it's going to end.
Every person in his right mind knows
this is the way it's going to end.
One thing we don't know is
how many people are going to die,
and how much time is going to pass.
But the end is very clear.
- Yeah.
- That's tragic.
Are there politicians
working towards a solution?
Yes, there are politicians
who are working for peace.
The problem is, if you have
three buses exploding in Tel Aviv,
- it will stop.
- Yeah.
And we can progress
the peace process once again,
and then if a settler in the territories
will kill somebody, it will stop again.
And so, we're being held hostage
by the extremists from both sides.
So this is basically lsrael,
and that's the Gaza Strip.
And...
It's pretty... It's pretty scary.
It is really scary. Imagine that rolling
up over your hill, coming at your house.
Imagine living like this. Imagine
this is how you live every single day.
[explosion]
Oh, shit.
[woman] A Qassam touched down next to
a daycare center in Sderot this morning.
No one was wounded in the attack,
but the Hamas chief warned the
rocket attacks on Israel will continue.
[Morgan] So this classroom was blown up
about eight and a half hours ago.
Luckily, there were no kids in it.
Rocket came from the Gaza Strip.
If there had been kids in here,
half of them would be dead.
You see this and get a sense
of how wrong things are.
I can't imagine raising my kid
up in a place like this.
I couldn't imagine living in a place
where my kid went to school,
and this is something
that can happen every day.
[woman] I think everything's going
pretty good with the pregnancy.
Thirty weeks, it's very active,
and it's positioned the right way,
and everything's good.
Take deep, full breaths into the belly.
I never imagined I would
spend my pregnancy like this,
separated from my partner,
but, then again,
before Morgan, I never thought
I would have kids, so... [laughs]
You just never can tell, can you?
[siren wails]
Here with the lsraeli Police
Bomb Squad, they got a call.
Two calls, actually.
Going to check them out.
[siren wails]
- Is it right here?
- Yeah. Right, few feet of us.
Let's go!
[in Hebrew] The suspicious object
is here, past the garbage can.
[man in Hebrew] Listen up.
Good evening to everyone.
There is
a suspicious object there.
I am asking everyone
who is in this area of Allenby
and the area of the boardwalk
to move away from the area.
The man on the hotel balcony,
get inside.
Everyone is requested to be
behind the police gates.
Pay attention. This is the bomb squad.
I am about to conduct a controlled
explosion on the suspicious object.
[Morgan] It's so scary.
And this happens every day.
Eight to ten times a day,
he said, sometimes up to 1 8.
Don't stand near the windows.
[man] Three... two... one. Go.
There's a bikini inside.
[laughs] Check it out.
Well, my heart's pounding
and it's a bikini. [laughs]
Nice job, pal. You did good.
- [beeps]
- Good job, buddy.
No, come on.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
- [beeping]
- There'll be plenty more chances.
- [Morgan] Can we ask you questions?
- [man] About what?
- About....
- Political?
- A little bit. [laughs]
- No, no.
I'd love to hear your thoughts on the
current conflict. It's all an illusion?
Yes.
Wow. That guy is one of the
greatest optimists I've ever seen.
How you doing?
Can I ask you a couple of questions?
[splashing]
So somebody just threw
a water balloon at us.
[man in Hebrew]
Get the hell out of here!
And now there's
a crowd gathering because
they're going to chase us away.
They're gathering numbers now.
There's a big flock of people
that's going to chase us.
- Go off!
- [man in Hebrew] Get out of here!
This is not your land.
I'm not allowed to talk
to anybody in the country?
[man in Hebrew]
Get the hell out of here!
- I'd say...
- Get out of here!
...we're not very wanted around here.
[in Hebrew] I'm going to break this.
This place is no joke. We were down
there just trying to talk to people.
So what you see here, majority
of people here don't think like them.
Yeah, I think we've found
enough peace here today.
Out of here, get out of here,
get out of here!
It is... It's no joke.
Go off! Go off!
- I'm going to my car.
- Go off!
Dude.
- Yeah.
- Jewish?
I'm going to my car.
- No Jewish.
- [shouting]
There's so many things
that are wrong on both sides.
If this was solved tomorrow,
if, suddenly, there were two states,
and people were living in peace,
would bin Laden go away?
I don't think it would happen.
What you're doing,
is you're taking an argument away.
It isn't. It's messed up.
[shouting]
There goes my friend. See you.
[Morgan] How hard is it for you
to be in the minority in this region,
a Christian in a Muslim country?
I have no problem whatsoever,
living with the Muslims.
We are worshipping Allah.
And, uh, I am worshipping the same God,
that the Christians and the Muslims
and the Jews are worshipping.
The one God.
Religion is being used as a mask
to hide the cruelty...
...the ugliness of violence.
Moderates, they are the majority,
but their voices are not loud enough.
[Morgan] What are your thoughts
on the global war on terror?
9/1 1 breaks the hearts
of every human being,
but I think the best way
is not to fight only.
You have to look for
the root of the problem.
What our American brothers
and friends need is a cultural strategy.
Without understanding each other,
without this mutual respect,
there's no peace. It's impossible.
Mission is impossible.
[Morgan] Not only is it impossible,
it's downright scary.
Just ask journalist Fouad Hussein.
Ten years ago while he was jailed for
criticizing Jordan's economic policies,
he met Abu Musab al-Zarqawi,
leader of Al-Qaeda in Iraq.
They remained pen pals
up until Zarqawi was killed in 2006.
According to what Zarqawi told him,
America is playing
right into Al-Qaeda's hands.
[in Arabic] Al-Qaeda attacked New York
and Washington on September 1 1th.
Because Al-Qaeda can't fight the U.S. on
its soil, they drew them to Arabic land
so that they will fight them here.
[Morgan] Had we left Afghanistan
and said "That's it."
You know, "We're done."
What would have happened?
After Afghanistan, Al-Qaeda
didn't have anywhere to operate.
If the United States
hadn't entered lraq,
Al-Qaeda wouldn't be
the same as they are now.
It would have ended
by the end of Afghanistan.
The psychology of the Arabs and Muslims
is to side
with whoever fights the occupier.
If bin Laden would be
caught or killed right now,
- would it make any difference?
- Nothing.
Nothing whatsoever.
Zarqawi was killed
and nothing happened.
And if bin Laden and Zawahiri
got killed, nothing will happen.
Because Al-Qaeda has become
an intercontinental idea,
the same as globalization.
[Morgan] And that idea is reaching
more and more people each day.
With Operation Special Delivery
only seven weeks away,
I need to go back to the beginning.
And the beginning for Osama
is Saudi Arabia.
Saudi Arabia is a country
ruled by one family,
and governed by one brand
of fundamental Islam, Wahhabism.
Osama was born here.
He went to school here.
And, in the late '70s,
he was radicalized here.
[man in Arabic] O God, one leader
to lead jihad for your sake.
To liberate the land of Palestine.
And the land of lraq
from the Christians.
O God, the strong and noble one.
O God, go after the Christians.
O God, make wars in their homes.
O God, release your armies upon them.
O God, make the land of Palestine
a graveyard for the Jews.
O God, make the land of lraq
a graveyard for the Christians.
[Morgan] Do you feel America
is trying to fight a war
against the religion of lslam?
[in Arabic] Well, look at what
you did in lraq and Afghanistan.
Well, they went to Afghanistan
to get Osama bin Laden.
And the Taliban wouldn't give him up.
Was it an act of aggression or not?
We were seeking peace in Afghanistan.
You went there with an ambulance
or with a tank?
[laughter]
That's a good question. Do you think
Osama bin Laden caused 9/1 1?
If one man in a cave
was able to do this...
What if all Muslims were
to resist against America
under the leadership of one man?
See, but I don't think 1.2 billion
Muslims think the same way you think.
One single verse from the Koran
and they will come.
So why has no one said that verse yet?
These things get planned.
Don't disregard it as unlikely.
What if we were to burn the refineries,
just to deprive you of the oil?
[Morgan] You said Saudi Arabia
is a country divided.
What do you mean by that?
Not divided, but not yet building
the national unity we are looking for.
One important issue in the Kingdom,
is to organize the relation between
the religious establishment
and the political establishment.
This issue hasn't been resolved yet,
and it must be resolved.
Otherwise, extremists, terrorists, may
dictate some of their ideologies on us.
And we still have so many people,
who are refusing to accept the reality.
Are there still radicals
within the country?
We still have a lot.
And they are dangerous, by the way.
We should not underestimate
the ability of the extremists.
Those people are ready to die.
Those people are ready to destroy.
Those people are ready
to kill themselves, kill their families,
they don't care about life.
Therefore, I think they are
a threat us, in Saudi Arabia,
then to other countries,
then to the world.
[man] In an unprecedented
nine month operation
netting more than
170 Al-Qaeda suspects,
and more than five million dollars,
Saudi intelligence officials
say they thwarted plans
to fly aircraft into oil facilities,
attack security installations,
kill senior officials
and send money to Al-Qaeda in Iraq.
But the raids reveal a far more
worrying trend for the Saudis.
The war in Iraq is spilling over
into Saudi Arabia.
Right in front of the head office
of the Mutawwa'un, the religious police,
is Chop Chop Square.
I'm standing right on the drain
where they...
[makes slicing noises]
...cut people's heads off,
and the blood goes into that drain.
Everybody stands around and watches.
They kill people
in the morning and then
play soccer in the afternoons.
What a place.
[Morgan] It's complete culture shock
for me to be in Saudi Arabia.
An absolute other world,
from anything I've ever experienced,
any place I've ever been.
We've been to Egypt and Morocco and
Jordan, and the Palestinian territories,
and these places are
so progressive by comparison.
There is no separation
of church and state.
Church is the state,
state is the church.
The religion and the ideology
is what runs everything.
Boys and girls separated
from the time they're ten.
You can't see La Perla's brassiere ad.
That's wrong. Oh, you can't
see Posh Spice's shoulder.
You can't see the knee or the thigh.
- Can't I police my own thoughts?
- No.
[Morgan] That's the problem
when a country's built entirely on
marriage between church and state.
There isn't much room for moderates.
There's no freedom of speech
or freedom of the press,
speaking or writing anything
critical of the royal family is illegal.
Public protest is actually forbidden.
The Ministry of Information monitors
the Web for any immoral content,
but websites supporting Al-Qaeda
seem to get through just fine.
[Morgan] What do fundamentalists
hope to achieve?
Power in the name of God.
That's where I don't like it.
They manipulate the lslamic teachings
to fit different situations,
different conditions,
- to, ultimately, lead them to power.
- Yeah.
I don't think a religious person,
be it Christian, Jewish or Muslim,
by his own upbringing and teaching,
is qualified to be a public official.
He's just not. Politics is
completely different from religion.
I don't think any religious person
is qualified to be a public official.
A good amount of secularism in every
Arab political system is badly needed.
Drawing clear lines
between where an lmam,
a priest role, a responsibility ends,
and a politician, or a
public official's responsibility begins.
We need it for stability.
I'd love to hear your thoughts
on Osama bin Laden.
Osama bin Laden, per se,
is not the problem.
The school of thought, the followers,
the teaching that he has planted
in lslamic countries,
in the Muslim world,
is where the restructuring
and the fight should begin.
It's unfortunate, but he is a product
of the system, the establishment.
There's no denying that.
We have to accept that.
[Morgan] I went to a school to find what
kids are being taught about the west.
[ Jon Spurney: School Days]
[Morgan] These two young,
open-minded, free-thinking students,
picked by the administration,
are the two I'm allowed to speak to.
Understanding that their teacher and
principal be present the whole time.
[Morgan] How old are you guys?
[man in Arabic] Eighteen.
Eighteen, yeah.
So how is it being 1 8 in Saudi Arabia?
[in Arabic] Great.
We have no worries or troubles.
What did you learn about the
United States while you were in school?
Actually, we did not study
the United States specifically.
What's your opinion
of the United States?
I have no definite opinion...
no specific opinion.
I'm just curious
what you think about the U.S.
In the United States we hear
one idea about Muslim countries,
Saudi Arabia is where
the hijackers came from.
Saudi Arabia is the country
that...
...makes a lot of money off of oil.
So I'm curious what you guys
hear about the United States.
No answer.
You have no answer? No? How about you?
Their view is...
Americans always want to dominate...
No, that was the wrong answer...
One of the things we hear a lot
in the United States,
is that there's a lot of anti-Western,
or anti-Semitic things taught in school.
What are you taught about lsrael?
[man in Arabic] Stop your cameras.
- What's wrong? I'm sorry?
- They want to stop.
- They want to stop the whole thing?
- Yes.
OK. [laughs]
How are you to have a discussion,
if he can't talk about things?
How are things supposed to change
if you can't address them?
Excuse me, I was wondering
if we could ask you a question?
Excuse me, I was wondering
if you guys could help me?
No?
Could I ask you guys a question? No?
Do you know anybody who could
get me in touch with Osama bin Laden?
Osama bin Laden?
[in Arabic] No, I have no leads.
It's becoming more obvious,
Osama never went to the mall.
- So this is a good moisturizer?
- [woman] Yeah.
- lt'll keep my hands really soft?
- Yeah.
- Where can I find Osama bin Laden?
- What?
- You saw him?
- Yes.
Do you know which aisle he was in?
- [laughing]
- Was he down past the Nutella?
Is he in Saudi Arabia?
- Maybe.
- Maybe. OK.
Maybe you can ask his family.
Maybe they can help you.
- OK. All right.
- Yeah.
- Cool, I'll do that. Thanks. Bye.
- OK. Bye.
It's a great suggestion.
I'm going to talk to his family.
[ Folkfoot: Where in the World is
Osama bin Laden (Freedom's Call)]
[ Folkfoot: Where in the World is
Osama bin Laden (Freedom's Call)]
OK, this is the Bin Laden
Aviation Agency.
How fitting, right?
That's terrible. Look, I'm not lying.
Right there. There's the
Bin Laden Aviation Agency.
[in Arabic] Where can
I marry Osama bin Laden?
- Oh, you don't know?
- [woman] I don't.
[man] Please make sure that
you have the correct number.
Your call cannot be completed as dialed.
After 9/1 1, wouldn't you change your
number if your last name was bin Laden?
That probably would have been
the very first thing I would have done.
I would have been like,
"God, Osama, you asshole.
Now I got to change
all my phone numbers."
[Morgan] There's a window right there.
[man in Arabic] We would like to ask you
some questions about Osama bin Laden.
Yeah.
We're looking for anything. A phone
number, any information we could get.
Anything anybody may know.
He's like, "Do you think he's here?"
I said, "He's not here?"
He goes, "Maybe." Maybe!
- He's in the basement.
- Maybe he's in the basement.
I'm looking for Osama bin Laden.
- [laughing]
- Why is that funny?
Why is that funny?
What's wrong with that?
- Where is your car?
- Where is my car?
Why, you going to blow it up
or something?
You want to see it?
[Morgan] We're going up
to bin Laden's farm.
We're going to go to his place, this
house that he built with his own hands.
We're going to talk to people in the
village, see if somebody can get me in.
[speaking Arabic]
- [Morgan] That guy said this was it.
- [man] Yeah.
- Not much of a farm. Look at this.
- Yeah.
It's like a trailer park.
This must be the house.
Let's go. Let's get out of here.
Man, I should have bought some sandals.
[Morgan] Well, I didn't find OBL,
or any good clues in
the desert of Saudi Arabia.
But that night I did find
Othman Ya al Bari,
who's related to
one of the 9/1 1 hijackers.
Hopefully, he could point me
in the right direction.
He's got professional wrestling on TV,
he knows what's good, see?
One of your relatives
was said to be one of the hijackers.
- [in Arabic] Yes.
- Yeah. Was he?
No.
After 9/1 1, there was video
of a lot of the hijackers.
A lot of them released video statements.
Do you not think that connects them
in some way to what happened?
I don't believe that is solid proof.
America wins all the Oscar awards.
It owns the best studios
and technologies in the world.
We've seen the animals,
the lion, the dog and the pig,
we've seen them in many movies
talking like humans.
I feel very uncomfortable
with this conversation.
What do you think
would drive some people
towards wanting to join
a group like Al-Qaeda?
What would make them want to go off
and fight, possibly lose their lives?
They go because they feel
like America...
you feel like...
She's trying all kinds
of ways to dominate
and impose her dominance
on the entire world,
especially on the Muslim world.
Have you had friends who
have gone off to wage jihad?
Yes, of course.
Where did they go?
These youth went first to Afghanistan.
Then America went into lraq,
and they followed.
How many people do you know that went?
- A lot.
- [man] A lot.
And how many have come back?
Unfortunately, nobody came back.
[beeping]
[Morgan] Afghanistan is a country at war
for more than 30 years,
and it feels like it.
From when the Soviet Union invaded,
to civil war, to the Taliban,
and now the arrival
of U. S. and NATO forces,
its impact is everywhere.
Wherever you go there's barricades,
barbed wire, people with guns,
checkpoints, more people with guns.
And, in the middle of all this,
is just this incredible poverty.
I thought the first place to look
in Afghanistan for Osama
was the last place that he was seen.
So we're heading out to Tora Bora.
They say, "No, no,
it's not dangerous at all,"
yet there's 21 guys here with guns...
[laughs] taking us to Tora Bora.
"No, it's fine. You're not gonna
need to worry about it at all."
[Arabic music plays]
Are there a lot of landmines
in this area?
[in foreign language]
No, not on the path...
- Really?
- Really.
OK.
[Morgan] So, this area here, this
was the beginning of Al-Qaeda's base?
[man in Arabic] This is where
Osama's headquarters was.
There are large caves on this
side and the other side too.
They were full of ammunition, weapons,
and food such as tea, sugar and rice.
Look, up there, should we go?
One of our soldiers
is shaking the nuts off the tree,
'cause, apparently,,
if you eat 20 of these nuts...
All night long.
It's the word on the street.
You can rock and roll all night.
Look at that, we got a guy
up in the tree to get the magic nuts.
Dude, look at that.
While these guys are playing with their
nuts, I think I'll head out on my own.
President Bush said that he wanted to
capture Osama bin Laden dead or alive.
The U. S. had its best chance
in late November of 2001,
when elements of both
Afghan and American forces
closed in on Osama's mountain hideout.
The following days saw some of the
heaviest fighting in all of the war.
Yoo-hoo! Osama!
And, rather than commit
additional U. S. ground forces,
the U. S. chose to rely on local
Afghan fighters to bring in OBL.
When the dust had settled,
Osama was gone.
The governor of the province has
ideas how to bring the excitement back.
[in foreign language] Our plan
and goal is that Tora Bora
should become an international
tourism center.
So we want to build a grand
amusement park in Tora Bora.
What kind of rides?
Everything will be built.
Maybe a roller coaster.
Everything will be built.
- Water slides?
- Absolutely.
- Ferris wheels? All of it?
- Yes. Yes.
You could say,
"Tora Bora. It's the bomb."
[crickets chirping]
[Morgan] I'm not sure how much fun
Afghanistan is ready for.
Seems to me they could use a lot more
than just roller coasters around here.
[in foreign language] No one
has done anything for us.
All the international aid
goes to those at the top.
It never makes its way down to us.
You got a tent from the UN.
No, we bought it
in the black market!
- No, we buy it in the black market.
- [laughing]
They haven't helped us with land,
money or to fix our tent or anything.
Look at this troublemaker!
When we're traveling at night,
we have to constantly check the camel to
make sure we didn't leave him somewhere.
Have you left him behind before?
Yeah, all the time!
We've lost them many times!
Our lives already passed. We are
concerned about our children.
They should be able
to have a better life.
[man] The international community
is failing to help this country
get on its feet.
Organizations such as USA gauge success
by how much money they spend.
Not by what it achieves.
The bigger budget they have,
the more impressed they are.
The fact that it doesn't achieve
anything, all the clinics don't exist,
no one seems to care back in the States,
that information doesn't get there.
[in foreign language]
No one is helping this place,
and if there is,
no one is distributing it.
There are more than 800 houses
here but no school or hospital.
We are living the same now
as we were under the Taliban.
America must hold
our government accountable.
America must ask why didn't you pave
the streets with the money we gave you.
All those houses were destroyed
by foreign countries.
Why don't they rebuild those houses?
They haven't done
anything positive here.
Two years ago, the U.S. Ambassador
came here and said,
"We're going to make a pledge to rebuild
the school." It's been two years.
Look at this place.
This is hearts and minds.
It looks like a bomb went off yesterday.
There's bullet holes. The front of the
building is riddled with bullet holes.
Blast holes.
Nothing's being done.
We've got to do something
for these kids.
We've gotta do something for these kids
to say, "Somebody cares about us.
Somebody cares about
us getting educated.
Somebody wants us
to be in a safe environment."
[Morgan] As somebody about to
become a father for the first time,
it's so instilling in me, reminding me,
of the things that I want for my family.
I don't ever want my child to be in
a position where they can't be educated.
Or can't feel like they can better
themselves, like that this is it.
That this is as good
as it gets for their life,
and to not have hope
that tomorrow is going to be better.
- [phone ringing]
- Ow.
- [phone ringing]
- Ow.
Man, this baby starts kicking
as soon as your phone rings.
- Baby knew I was calling.
- We miss you.
Baby knew. Ow!
- Oh, I miss you so much.
- Yeah. Me, too.
[Morgan] I dreamt we had
a girl last night.
[woman] That's cute.
[Morgan] Ever see
Osama bin Laden around here?
[in foreign language] God know,
if we catch him, we will tear him apart.
Osama bin Laden's Afghan's enemies.
[in foreign language] Who is Osama?
He is the one who destroyed
those buildings in America.
Fuck him.
And fuck America.
I'm looking for Osama bin Laden.
- Pakistan.
- Pakistan?
- Pakistan.
- OK!
Pakistan? Pakistan.
[in foreign language]
It is very obvious to the world
that he is hiding in Pakistan.
You should find him
so we have peace in the world.
[Morgan] I'm looking for
Osama bin Laden.
[in foreign language] Tribal area.
Near Peshawar?
[heart beat on speaker]
That is so cool.
I love you so much.
I love you too, baby.
[imitating heartbeat]
That was my baby's
little disco heartbeat.
What will happen if I go
to Pakistan to look for him?
[in foreign language]
You will find him.
I will find him?
You want to come look for him with me?
No? [laughing]
Why not?
I'll miss my family.
- [man] I'm gonna miss my family.
- You'll miss your family.
I miss my family very much.
If I went into the tribal area,
you think I'd be OK?
[in foreign language] God knows
what will happen if you go there.
Something terrible will happen to you.
You're finished.
The Taliban will cut your head.
- They'll cut my head? Yeah.
- Yeah.
Ugh!
So Alex started getting
contractions last night.
Braxton Hicks contractions,
which aren't real contractions,
but it's your body
preparing for a contraction.
And, here I am, missing it all.
And, here I am, missing it all.
Missing it all, man, missing it all.
[man singing in Arabic]
[Morgan] We just found out from U.S.
military that we can go out on an embed.
And it's frightening. But the most
important thing, for me, is to try and,
hopefully, just narrow down the path
to finding the most wanted man
on the planet.
How much they're actually looking for
this guy, who knows? But we'll find out.
This stuff is so heavy.
Everything in your body tells you
you shouldn't be going to a job,
or doing something where you
gotta wear a bulletproof vest.
[man] The next thing
you'll see here in America...
...you'll see terrorism.
If you don't think you'll see,
you're blinding yourself to the
historic development of everything
taking place on this earth.
Terrorism.
Terrorism.
[man] First of all, I'd like to welcome
all of you guys to Firebase Apache.
- What questions do you have?
- Will we be able to speak
to any of the people in the area
who actually live in the local villages?
Um, when you go out to 4-2, yeah.
- There's a village right next to them.
- OK.
And that village also happens
to be full of Taliban.
[woman] I'd like to remind you, while
talking about going outside the wire.
When whoever we're with, whoever's
escorting us says, "Let's go,"
get in the vehicle and go.
It doesn't mean finish your question.
It means go now.
[Leppert] This is hardcore
Taliban country, let me tell you.
Over those mountains,
that's Afghanistan.
If you go over those mountains,
that's Pakistan.
We're centrally located
with a lot of activity around us.
[Morgan] Will we stop
in a village tomorrow?
- Yes, we will.
- What's the plan for the afternoon?
We're fogbound, we'll test fire
weapons, talk, whatever you want.
You've got free rein.
I had a lot of grouping
right beside the guy.
Well, if nothing else,
it scared the hell out of him.
Can I try a rocket launcher?
[laughing] That was awesome.
You've been here six months.
You might be able to tell me.
Where is Osama bin Laden?
[Leppert] We ask that
every time we go out.
"Hey? You guys know where Osama's at?"
They always point up to the mountains.
[in foreign language] Where's Osama?
[laughter]
- [Morgan] Where's Osama bin Laden?
- I have no clue.
Is he alive?
Even if he was,
I don't think we'd know.
We are going to stop
and speak to villagers.
They said I should
write my blood type on
anything that'd be attached to me.
Scary as shit, man.
What we're concentrating on
is your security. That's it.
In a firefight I'm going to come in.
Come to this effect, bring you in
and we'll grab you to here.
As soon as I do,
I'm going to try to grab you again.
As soon as it's safe,
then we're going to move out.
When we go out, we expect to have
contact. We expect to get shot at.
Anything goes out there. We always
got to be ready for everything.
[man] This is what we call
a "friendly village."
[laughter]
[man] Once they understand
it's their choice to talk,
the forces will stand back.
And then whoever wants to talk to you
will talk to you.
[man] Morgan, come up,
let's introduce you.
Yes, sir.
[in foreign language]
This person is a civilian
from America and wants
to ask you some questions.
His name is Morgan.
[Morgan] I was hoping you could
tell me your thoughts
on the Taliban and
the current conflict happening.
[in foreign language]
What do you think,
who is happy with battles?
No one is happy with battles.
We are not happy.
We don't like the war.
We want a peaceful life.
We are neither your friends nor the
Taliban's. We just want a simple life.
What are things, when you look
at your village, you need the most?
In terms of assistance.
The most important problem
is the lack of water.
Before the base drilled their well
we didn't have any water problems.
- What do you think of Osama bin Laden?
- [man] Morgan!
Let's go now! Now!
- Come on!
- Let's go now!
[man on radio] Be advised, I've
just been informed of an ambush,
possibly the governor's convoy.
[man 2] And we are in pursuit
of two individuals on foot.
Jedi-1, we're at 2-0-6. That village to
our left is where the Taliban went to.
We have one downed Taliban.
We have their motorcycle
in our possession. Over.
[Morgan] People have said Afghanistan is
a winnable war. What are your thoughts?
In counter-insurgency,
killing doesn't work.
Got to work on the center of gravity,
the people.
They like having clean water,
having a medical clinic.
They like seeing
their kids go to school.
It just makes it more difficult
for the Taliban to change the tide
and get the people
to go to the other side.
[in foreign language] Thank you
and please tell your commander
the father of Taza Gui
says peace.
[Morgan] What would have happened if
we had sent more troops here in 2002?
You would have killed more Taliban,
but, I mean, we're killing
a lot of Taliban right now.
And they've got the open sieve
from the madrassas of Pakistan
in the refugee camps that go to
these young kids who don't have a job,
who have no positive outlook in life.
They sell them with a lot of propaganda.
Tell them they're going to give
their family money, bring them here.
- Where is Osama?
- I think he's in Pakistan.
[beeping]
I think it's quite likely
that Osama bin Laden is in Pakistan.
[woman] The latest intelligence
has always seemed to indicate
that he is in Pakistan.
[man] He's probably somewhere
along that border region.
- Pakistan.
- Along that border.
Tribal areas of Pakistan.
Senior leadership,
number one and two are there.
On the Pakistan border it's particularly
dangerous, a region where terror rules.
And where many believe
Osama bin Laden could be hiding.
Everyone I've spoken to
said this is where Osama's hiding out.
[Morgan] Everyone, that is,
except for Pakistanis.
- Where is Osama?
- [Morgan] You tell me.
- Where is Osama?
- I'm looking for him. You tell me.
[in foreign language]
He's in Afghanistan.
Osama bin Laden is here.
Afghanistan.
Osama bin Laden...
Which animal is that?
I don't where he is, but it's also
a question if he's alive or dead.
But, um, his influence is here.
[in foreign language] He is
a great soldier of the Muslims.
He is fighting for righteousness.
He's a diamond.
Osama is exploiting the root causes.
If we find the root causes,
we'll solve everything.
- Osama bin Laden is nothing, sir.
- He is only one! One person!
Dude, look at that.
Even in Pakistan they love wrestling.
- All the people like the wrestling.
- Tell me why you like wrestling.
- Because wrestling is fair.
- Can I let you in on a little secret?
- It's fixed.
- Fixed?
- Fixed. It's not real.
- Maybe.
- You are right. I know. You are right.
- OK. Good.
But when it is for a belt,
then it is not fixed.
I'm looking, uh... How are you?
How are you? Hi.
I'm just looking...
[Morgan] Just based on what everybody
has said, I got to think we're within
a couple hundred miles of where he is.
Maybe even less.
Yeah, OK. OK. Thank you.
Tomorrow we're heading into
this area of the tribal regions,
just past Peshawar, where everyone
has told me Osama bin Laden is.
I mean, I have no idea
what to expect when I get there.
I've been traveling for months
to try and find this person
that everybody we talk to...
You know, they all say,
"Why are you looking for this person?
What is he? He's one man?"
The thing that I've realized
is that this whole trip
is a chance to actually go out
and see and talk to those people
that we're told to be
so scared of all the time.
I'm not somebody who thinks we can
sit around the campfire
and sing Kumbaya, you know?
That's ridiculous.
[laughing]
But I believe that we create
these demons within ourselves.
And we create these demons
within the media.
And we create these visions
that are so beyond reality.
They start feeding themselves
after a while.
Our fear just becomes exponential.
They say when you go
looking for trouble, you'll find it.
It's not that I'm looking for trouble.
I'm just looking for answers.
And I think I've found a lot.
I think I've found a lot on this trip.
"Attention. Entry of foreigners
is prohibited beyond this point."
Even if I go over the border
to find Osama,
it's not going to, suddenly,
make the world safer for my kid.
The things that are pushing people
to follow him and his ideas
are still going to be there.
And that's what we have to change.
I think that we need
to take a step back...
...and really ask ourselves, "What kind
of a world do we want to live in?
What do we want that world to be?"
It's not worth it.
So her water just broke,
which is very exciting.
So, I'm that much closer.
- OK.
- OK? You want to get up?
[Alex groaning]
[laughter]
[woman] It's your son!
- [Morgan] It's a boy!
- [Alex] We have a baby boy!
- We have a baby boy.
- Oh, my God! He's beautiful.
- [crying]
- [laughter]
[Morgan] So,
I didn't end up finding Osama.
What I did find, is that there
are a lot more people out there
who are just like us,
than there are who are just like him.
I'll always bet on the billions of
regular people to win over the crazies.
After all, we all want
the same things for our families.
We want the world to be a place
where we can raise and love our kids.
Where they can have everything
they need to be happy, healthy,
without it blowing up around them.
It's not going to be easy. And all that
reward money sure would have helped but,
hey, you know what?
He's going to love public school.
