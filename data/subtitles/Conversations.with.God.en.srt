as much as I can from where I am:

If what you’re asking me is, did I make
all of this stuff up, the answer is no:

72
00:06:57,183 --> 00:07:00,860
I've wondered what you're wondering:

73
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:04,123
"Will anyone believe me,
believe what I'm saying: : :

74

Believe where this came from?"

75

that's up to you-

76
00:07:09,119 --> 00:07:11,421
to each of you:

77
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:14,934
I only hope that you don’t
disqualify or marginalize the message: : :

78

um, and all of you:

those mistakes to this day:

are such a miracle for me:

84
00:07:47,135 --> 00:07:48,957
They-They came out of a need-

85

for me to change my life:

it's still happening:

My question is: : :

91
00:08:07,775 --> 00:08:10,197
If God has one message-

92
00:08:10,303 --> 00:08:13,435
his most important
message to all of us-

93
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:17,758

what would it be?

So you don’t kill yourself
in the middle of the night:

173
00:17:14,431 --> 00:17:17,333

one of those old canvas jobs: : :

[Neale] To God,
there is no separation: : :

185
00:18:50,334 --> 00:18:52,473
Between financial abundance
and spirituality:

186
00:18:52,574 --> 00:18:55,738
In fact, they go hand in hand:

187
00:18:57,118 --> 00:18:59,223
Don’t you find it odd
that we live: : :

188
00:18:59,326 --> 00:19:03,516
In a society that devalues
our most important jobs?

189
00:19:03,615 --> 00:19:06,549
- What do you mean by that?
- [Neale] I mean, we have no problem: : :

with spirituality: : :

00:19:15,614 --> 00:19:17,981

step out of that tent for a minute?

00:21:22,622 --> 00:21:24,444
Uh, what for?

226
00:21:26,206 --> 00:21:29,719
I know you got in late,
but I run things around here: : :

227
00:21:29,822 --> 00:21:33,237
- And you should be aware of the rules:
- Uh, rules?

228
00:21:33,342 --> 00:21:35,164
Yeah:
I'll walk you through them:

229
00:21:35,262 --> 00:21:39,004
How about you come a little bit
closer so I don't have to yell?

230
00:21:39,102 --> 00:21:41,949
- Okay:
- Okay:

231
00:21:42,046 --> 00:21:44,435

you've got your bathrooms:

Now, our maid quit
about a month ago: : :

234
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,697
So we'd appreciate it
if you would clean up after yourself:

235
00:21:52,798 --> 00:21:55,384
- Okay:
- Those cabins back there-

236
00:21:55,486 --> 00:21:59,163
- freight on them: 75 per week:
- Right:

237
00:21:59,262 --> 00:22:02,393
Now, down by the water
you've got another picnic area:

238
00:22:02,494 --> 00:22:04,982
Those are reserved for real campers
and real campers only:

Uh, real campers?

240
00:22:06,846 --> 00:22:08,919
They usually arrive by automobile:

we call them professional campers
around here:

- Yeah?
- You professionals have a way of lingering on-

246
00:22:23,199 --> 00:22:25,239
kind of like those guys over there:

247
00:22:25,342 --> 00:22:28,539
[Chuckles] I should be back
on my feet in a few days: : :

As soon as I, uh, find a job:

249
00:22:30,942 --> 00:22:33,593
Because you got in late,
last night's on the house:

starts on Friday at 3:00 p: M:

Uh, yes: Yes, we do:

Well, good morning to you then:
And by the way?

256
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:58,550
- Yeah?

How about you tell me: : :

264
00:23:26,622 --> 00:23:29,011
Why Osborne and Associates
should hire someone like you?

265

Why you?

Well, uh, despite

00:23:34,046 --> 00:23:36,315
I've held supervising positions
for three companies:

268
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:39,261
Which makes me wonder
about your work ethic:

269
00:23:39,358 --> 00:23:42,457
Or maybe you're on some type
of desultory path:

270
00:23:42,558 --> 00:23:45,755
- It means "lack of purpose:"
- Uh-huh:

271
00:23:47,198 --> 00:23:49,337
Yeah, well, the truth of it
is I was laid off: : :

272
00:23:49,438 --> 00:23:51,261
When the stations were
bought out and consolidated:

273
00:23:51,358 --> 00:23:53,300
I mean,
everything's corporate now: : :

274
00:23:53,406 --> 00:23:56,635
And I'm nearing 50
and so overqualified: : :

275
00:23:56,734 --> 00:23:58,839
That you're probably
not going to hire me, are you?

276
00:23:58,942 --> 00:24:02,871
Well, the thing of it is, most applicants
carry a master's degree: You don't:

277
00:24:02,974 --> 00:24:06,455
No, I don't, but I still think I can do
a good job for Osborne and Associates:

Excuse me!

502
00:45:13,724 --> 00:45:16,790
Uh- Do you know how long
this is going to be?

503
00:45:16,893 --> 00:45:19,544
I'm-I'm, uh-
I'm expecting a phone call:

504
00:45:19,645 --> 00:45:21,914
- It's- It's sort of important:
- What the hell now?

505
00:45:22,012 --> 00:45:23,987
- [Ringing]
- I don't know: It just died:

506
00:45:24,093 --> 00:45:26,940
Figure it out: We got two more stops
before quitting time: You, come here:

507
00:45:27,037 --> 00:45:29,077
- [Neale] Hello?
- Neale?

508
00:45:29,181 --> 00:45:31,036
- [Man] Scrap that there:
- Uh, h-hello:

509
00:45:31,133 --> 00:45:32,540
Hi: It's Leora:

510
00:45:32,637 --> 00:45:34,841
- Hi, Leora:
- Did I catch you at a bad time?

511
00:45:34,941 --> 00:45:37,276
- [Shouting]
- No, no, no, no: It's perfect: Perfect: I'm good:

512
00:45:37,372 --> 00:45:39,477
- How are you?
- Good: Listen:

513
00:45:39,581 --> 00:45:41,915
I told Roy about you:
He'd like to have you come in: : :

514
00:45:42,013 --> 00:45:44,315
- Tomorrow, say around 9:00?
- [Man] What’s happening there, Dennis?

515
00:45:44,413 --> 00:45:46,235
Uh, tomorrow would be great:
Yeah, sure:

516
00:45:46,333 --> 00:45:48,155
- Just bleed the line!
- That would be good:

517
00:45:48,253 --> 00:45:51,155
- [Shouting Continues]
- Okay: Uh, you know where we are?

518
00:45:51,261 --> 00:45:54,076
- K: Y: O: L:
- I'm sure I can find you, Leora:

519
00:45:54,173 --> 00:45:56,922
- Okay: Then we'll see you tomorrow:
- Right: Okay:

520
00:45:57,021 --> 00:45:59,738
- Bye-bye:
- [Hammering Resumes]

521
00:46:04,412 --> 00:46:06,452
Thank you!

522
00:46:08,765 --> 00:46:10,652
So let me get this straight:
What you’re saying: : :

523
00:46:10,749 --> 00:46:13,400
Is that we're all having
a conversation with God all of the time:

524
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:17,210
- Of course:
- Can you give me an example
of what you mean by that?

525
00:46:17,309 --> 00:46:22,840
Sure: Um, do you ever pick up the phone
to call someone, and they’re already on the line?

526
00:46:22,941 --> 00:46:25,429
Or, uh, do you ever drive down
the road feeling as though: : :

527
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:27,355
Nothing makes sense of your life: : :

528
00:46:27,452 --> 00:46:30,355
And the next song on the radio
speaks directly to you?

529
00:46:30,461 --> 00:46:32,600
It’s as if the lyrics
were written specifically for you: : :

530
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:35,122
And suddenly everything
falls into perspective:

531
00:46:35,228 --> 00:46:38,490
Or, um- Or what about
when someone enters your life: : :

532
00:46:38,589 --> 00:46:41,338
Seemingly from nowhere,
and you wonder why they are there: : :

533
00:46:41,437 --> 00:46:43,608
And then one day
it all makes sense: : :

534
00:46:43,709 --> 00:46:46,611
And you wonder how you ever
got along without them?

535
00:46:46,717 --> 00:46:48,855
Of course:
We've all had those moments:

536
00:46:48,957 --> 00:46:50,779
[Neale]
That is God:

537
00:46:50,877 --> 00:46:53,244
[Woman]
Well, it happened to him: It can happen to you:

538
00:46:53,341 --> 00:46:56,407
- Is happening to you- and you:
- I stand corrected:

539
00:46:56,509 --> 00:46:58,451
We'll be right back
with Neale Donald Walsch: : :

540
00:46:58,557 --> 00:47:00,794
And his book Conversations With God:

541
00:47:07,645 --> 00:47:10,492
[Birds Calling]

542
00:47:26,364 --> 00:47:28,568
[Rooster Crows]

543
00:47:35,165 --> 00:47:37,652
I knew I had something
back there that would work:

544
00:47:39,037 --> 00:47:40,859
Great:

545
00:47:43,132 --> 00:47:47,388
And, uh, thanks for- thanks for
cleaning up- the shirt as well:

546
00:47:47,484 --> 00:47:49,459
I'm gonna look employable:

547
00:47:49,565 --> 00:47:51,637
It's only fear:

548
00:47:51,741 --> 00:47:55,188
That's easy for you to say:
You're not the one going back out there:

549
00:47:55,293 --> 00:47:58,042
What if it doesn't work?

550
00:47:58,140 --> 00:48:01,239
What if it does?
Neale, you're afraid: : :

551
00:48:01,341 --> 00:48:04,854
To give up the very thing in yourself
that brought you here in the first place:

552
00:48:04,957 --> 00:48:07,892
Give up?
I'm running on empty:

553
00:48:07,996 --> 00:48:10,451
And that's why you're here:

554
00:48:10,557 --> 00:48:13,939
Uh, well, no: I'm here because-
because I lost my job:

555
00:48:14,045 --> 00:48:15,867
You're here
because you lost yourself:

556
00:48:17,148 --> 00:48:19,865
Well, right now I just want
to get this job:

557
00:48:19,964 --> 00:48:22,419
You will:

558
00:48:22,525 --> 00:48:24,794
You're ready for that now:

559
00:48:24,893 --> 00:48:29,083
This is your opportunity
to experience real love:

560
00:48:29,181 --> 00:48:31,831
What did you have in mind?

561
00:48:33,277 --> 00:48:35,164
For you to be a man:

562
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:40,664
A real man, Neale:
Not a predator:

563
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:45,459
How many women is it going to take?

564
00:48:45,565 --> 00:48:49,755
How far do you need to fall
before you realize that your behavior: : :

565
00:48:49,853 --> 00:48:52,602
Is an attempt to destroy yourself?

566
00:48:54,461 --> 00:48:57,112
Heal that: : :

567
00:48:58,461 --> 00:49:00,348
And you'll be free:

568
00:49:12,701 --> 00:49:14,523
[Sighs]

569
00:49:17,341 --> 00:49:19,512
[Chef] Come here, Neale:
Let’s have a look at you:

570
00:49:20,573 --> 00:49:22,395
[Fitch]
Come here:

571
00:49:22,493 --> 00:49:24,914
Didn't I tell you
she was some miracle worker?

572
00:49:25,021 --> 00:49:27,890
- [Rooster Crows]
- [Fitch] So how'd it go?

573
00:49:27,997 --> 00:49:29,819
I don't know:

574
00:49:29,917 --> 00:49:33,561
Son, we've been trying to get a look
inside her trailer for years:

575
00:49:33,661 --> 00:49:36,116
How is it?

576
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:38,838
- It's good:
- She make your head spin?

577
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:41,144
She made his head spin:

578
00:49:43,036 --> 00:49:47,062
- How we doing on time? Fitch, you with us?
- Yeah: Yeah:

579
00:49:47,165 --> 00:49:49,532
Neale:

580
00:49:49,629 --> 00:49:52,247
We know, uh,
what a big deal this is for you:

581
00:49:54,716 --> 00:49:56,920
Help you with the bus fare:

582
00:49:57,021 --> 00:49:59,672
And you got enough time
to get a hot breakfast too:

583
00:49:59,772 --> 00:50:01,944
Maybe some bacon, eggs,
pancakes with syrup:

584
00:50:02,044 --> 00:50:04,695
And toast: Don't forget the toast:
And some jelly:

585
00:50:04,797 --> 00:50:08,179
Grape if they have it: And some biscuits:
Maybe some biscuits with-

586
00:50:08,285 --> 00:50:10,773
- You eating this breakfast, or is he?
- [Laughs]

587
00:50:10,876 --> 00:50:13,397
- Guys? Thanks:
- [Fitch] Go on now:

588
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:15,605
Yeah, go on, Neale:

589
00:50:18,397 --> 00:50:21,397
- My man is stepping up:
- Yeah:

590
00:50:40,605 --> 00:50:42,776
Funny, huh?

591
00:50:42,876 --> 00:50:46,106
What's the big deal if someone wants
to look at your watch, right?

592
00:50:47,516 --> 00:50:50,233
Hey, have we met before?

593
00:50:50,332 --> 00:50:52,787
Uh, uh- No, I don't think so:

594
00:50:52,893 --> 00:50:55,064
- I'm Carly
- Hi:

595
00:50:55,165 --> 00:50:57,815
Uh, "You come here often?"

596
00:50:57,916 --> 00:50:59,826
- [Clears Throat] Name's Neale:
- Neale:

597
00:50:59,932 --> 00:51:02,867
I'm kidding, of course, because if you had,
I would have seen you, right?

598
00:51:02,972 --> 00:51:06,201
I'm like a fixture on this bus:
Whew: That's me:

599
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:08,471
You'd think one of these days
I would buy a car:

600
00:51:08,572 --> 00:51:10,394
Nope:
I love people too much:

601
00:51:10,492 --> 00:51:13,427
I'm a receptionist: I work for
a construction company up in Medford:

602
00:51:13,532 --> 00:51:16,631
We are getting
crazy busy lately: Yeah:

603
00:51:16,733 --> 00:51:20,791
No: 'Cause the thought of sitting in a car
by myself all day long? Not for me:

604
00:51:20,893 --> 00:51:22,715
I love people:

605
00:51:22,813 --> 00:51:25,017
- Wait: I said that already, didn't I?
- Yeah:

606
00:51:25,116 --> 00:51:27,386
[Laughs] Yeah, well, it's true:
Call me crazy:

607
00:51:27,484 --> 00:51:30,005
- [Laughs]
- It's nice meeting you:

608
00:51:30,108 --> 00:51:33,108
- Oh, are you getting off?
- Uh, you know, l-I think so:

609
00:51:33,213 --> 00:51:36,660
- [Bell Dings]
- Shoot: God, isn't that just how life is?

610
00:51:36,764 --> 00:51:39,830
I mean, people just moving in
and moving out, and you never know why: : :

611
00:51:39,933 --> 00:51:42,388
Or if you're ever even
gonna see them again:

612
00:51:42,492 --> 00:51:45,274
- I never thought about it that way:
- Makes you think, doesn't it?

613
00:51:45,372 --> 00:51:47,827
- Well, good-bye:
- Oh, no, no, no, no:

614
00:51:47,932 --> 00:51:49,754
You don't get to say "good-bye:"

615
00:51:49,852 --> 00:51:52,023
"See you later:" "Till we meet again:"
Anything but "good-bye:"

616
00:51:52,124 --> 00:51:54,011
I mean, "good-bye"
is something that you say: : :

617
00:51:54,108 --> 00:51:57,043
When you walk out on a bad job
or you leave a bad lover:

618
00:51:57,148 --> 00:51:59,604
- Yeah: Yeah:
- Yeah:

619
00:51:59,708 --> 00:52:02,391
Well, um, see you later:

620
00:52:03,612 --> 00:52:05,652
[Chuckles]

621
00:52:05,757 --> 00:52:08,790
- Later:
- [Carly Laughs]

622
00:52:11,548 --> 00:52:14,396
Hey: Now that's
what I'm talking about:

623
00:52:18,044 --> 00:52:21,360
[Man] We’re talking to
dead people, folks: Spooky stuff:

624
00:52:21,469 --> 00:52:25,047
You’ve been listening to
Fat Friday Morning Freak-out Show:

625
00:52:25,149 --> 00:52:28,247
Bob and Jane will be here
with me on Monday:

626
00:52:28,349 --> 00:52:30,967
They got a new book called
Breaking Up With Mommy-

627
00:52:31,069 --> 00:52:34,484
or Daddy or Your Cousin
or whatever the damn name is:

628
00:52:34,588 --> 00:52:36,498
And they’re gonna be
doing a book signing: : :

629
00:52:36,604 --> 00:52:40,150
At Medford Pegasus Bookstore
starting at 7:00 p: M:

630
00:52:40,252 --> 00:52:43,929
On Monday, I will be talking
to an angry deli worker:

631
00:52:44,028 --> 00:52:47,225
He’s mad at you idiots who go
and order sliced turkey breast: : :

632
00:52:47,324 --> 00:52:50,423
And then at the last minute
change it over to sliced ham:

633
00:52:50,525 --> 00:52:53,459
And then for coming in
at 8:00 at night-

634
00:52:53,564 --> 00:52:56,019
- [Neale] Good morning:
- You must be Neale:

635
00:52:56,125 --> 00:52:58,426
- Yes:
- Leora:

636
00:52:58,524 --> 00:53:00,597
- We spoke on the phone:
- I'm Rockin' Roy, the Morning Boy-

637
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:03,220
- Of course: Thanks for getting me in:
- You're not in yet:

638
00:53:03,324 --> 00:53:05,397
- [Roy] Stay young: Stay cool:
- You still have to meet Roy:

639
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:06,907
- (music)(music) [Rock]
- He's a handful:

640
00:53:07,004 --> 00:53:08,826
You tell Jainey I wanna talk to her:

641
00:53:08,924 --> 00:53:12,023
I don't remember approving this, uh,
drunk Russian guy for tomorrow's show:

642
00:53:12,124 --> 00:53:15,223
Nobody cares about this: I mean,
so what if he drank too much vodka: : :

643
00:53:15,325 --> 00:53:18,172
And fell out of a six-story building
and lived to tell about it?

644
00:53:18,269 --> 00:53:20,440
That-That's actually pretty funny:

645
00:53:20,541 --> 00:53:22,908
Okay, yeah, we go
with the drunk Russian guy: : :

646
00:53:23,005 --> 00:53:26,420
But just get me a list of backups
in case he turns out to be a dud:

647
00:53:26,524 --> 00:53:30,899
And make sure that he is not drunk,
because l-Who the hell is this?

648
00:53:31,004 --> 00:53:34,582
This is your 9:00:
For the weekend slot:

649
00:53:34,685 --> 00:53:36,823
Oh: Yeah, yeah:
Okay: Hi: Hi:

650
00:53:36,924 --> 00:53:38,833
- Hi:
- Uh, just head in: I'll be right in:

651
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:40,500
- You got it:
- Okay?

652
00:53:40,604 --> 00:53:42,993
Listen, next time I'm talking about
my personal affairs: : :

653
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:46,035
It would be nice if you'd let me know
there's someone standing right there:

654
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:48,923
If you'd take a breath once in a while,
I would be happy to:

655
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:50,843
Just get me the files, all right?

656
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:53,144
Cancel this lunch:

657
00:53:53,244 --> 00:53:56,375
Oh, man: I am sorry
about all these delays:

658
00:53:56,476 --> 00:53:59,509
I have had
just a crazy month: Uh-

659
00:53:59,612 --> 00:54:02,579
So, how are you, uh, Nick?

660
00:54:02,684 --> 00:54:05,269
- Uh, Neale:

it has been shouted:

829
01:10:46,011 --> 01:10:49,524
In the lowest place,
its whisper has been heard:

830
01:10:49,627 --> 01:10:51,961
And through the corridors
of all human experience: : :

831
01:10:52,059 --> 01:10:54,742
This truth has been echoed:

832
01:10:54,843 --> 01:10:58,192
Love is the answer:

833
01:10:58,300 --> 01:11:01,496
You have projected
the role of parent onto God: : :

834
01:11:01,596 --> 01:11:06,833
And have thus come up with a god
who judges and rewards or punishes:

835
01:11:06,940 --> 01:11:10,136
You have created a fear-based
reality around love:

836
01:11:10,236 --> 01:11:14,294
And this fear-based love reality dominates
your experience of love:

837
01:11:14,395 --> 01:11:16,664
Indeed, it actually creates it:

838
01:11:19,099 --> 01:11:22,328
Is it fear that you need
in order to be, do and have: : :

839
01:11:22,427 --> 01:11:24,467
What is intrinsically right?

840
01:11:24,571 --> 01:11:27,288
Must you be threatened
in order to be good?

841
01:11:27,387 --> 01:11:29,460
And what is being good?

842
01:11:29,563 --> 01:11:31,985
Who gets the final say about that?

843
01:11:32,091 --> 01:11:35,474
I tell you this:
You are your own rule-maker:

844
01:11:35,579 --> 01:11:38,132
You set the guidelines:

845
01:11:38,235 --> 01:11:40,886
Love is all there is:

846
01:11:40,987 --> 01:11:44,599
Yes, you’ve heard it before: In fact,
I’ve even put it on a bumper sticker for you:

847

But in times of trouble, in
times of worry, doubt or fear: : :

848
01:11:48,795 --> 01:11:50,617
You choose to forget:

849
01:11:50,715 --> 01:11:53,781
What you should do is answer
the simple question-

850
01:11:53,884 --> 01:11:56,753
what would love do now?

851
01:11:56,859 --> 01:11:59,794

without expectation: : :

852
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:02,834
Without the need
for specific results: : :

853
01:12:02,939 --> 01:12:05,273
That is freedom:

854
01:12:11,547 --> 01:12:16,304
Remember: You are constantly
in the act of creating yourself:

855
01:12:16,411 --> 01:12:20,340
You are, in every moment,
deciding who and what you are:

856
01:12:20,443 --> 01:12:24,185
You decide this largely through
the choices you make: : :

857
01:12:24,283 --> 01:12:27,065
Regarding who and what
you feel passionate about:

858

Gotta tell ya, I'm a little worried
about what people might say: : :

When I tell 'em I'm having
a conversation with you:

Worry is the activity of a mind: : :

861
01:12:38,363 --> 01:12:40,730
That does not understand
its connection with me:

862

- Do you remember the question-
what would love do now?

863
01:12:46,267 --> 01:12:49,845

merely what’s happening:

869
01:13:10,011 --> 01:13:13,394

- I just want my life back:

870

- I'm sorry?

871
01:13:16,571 --> 01:13:18,393
Well, what are you sorry for?

872
01:13:18,491 --> 01:13:21,590
- You said I can't have anything I want:
- That’s right:

873
01:13:21,691 --> 01:13:24,691
- What?
- You can’t have anything you want:

874
01:13:24,795 --> 01:13:27,250
- I can't have anything I want?
- Correct:

875
01:13:27,355 --> 01:13:29,843
- Well, that doesn't make sense:
- Sure, it does:

876
01:13:29,947 --> 01:13:31,769
Your very request is one of lack: : :

877
01:13:31,867 --> 01:13:35,696
And you saying you want a thing only works
to produce that precise experience-

- Yeah:

879
01:13:39,547 --> 01:13:41,369
Should I therefore punish you: : :

880
01:13:41,467 --> 01:13:45,657
For making a choice that I myself
have laid before you?

881
01:13:45,756 --> 01:13:48,374
This is a question
you must ask yourself: :

882
01:13:48,475 --> 01:13:52,370
Before you would assign me
the role of a condemning god:

beseeched me, show myself:

Now is the time to go to
your god space, more than ever:

It will bring you
great peace of mind:

[Female Voice] Do you imagine
this is too big a problem for me to solve?

Is getting out of this jam
too big a miracle for me to handle?

it’s too big for you to handle: : :

01:21:07,995 --> 01:21:10,035
Which is why we're putting this
on the fast track:

998
01:21:10,138 --> 01:21:11,960
- Okay:
- My office will call your people:

999
01:21:12,058 --> 01:21:14,993
- They'll work out the details:
- Okay: Well, um, um, ju-

1000
01:21:15,098 --> 01:21:18,000
Uh, Bob, I am my people:

1001
01:21:18,107 --> 01:21:20,976
Not anymore, Neale:
Now you've got yourself a partner:

1002
01:21:21,083 --> 01:21:23,319
I'll be in touch:

1003
01:21:27,066 --> 01:21:28,888
Yes!

1004
01:21:42,778 --> 01:21:45,299
[No Audible Dialogue]

1005
01:22:13,275 --> 01:22:15,347
The woman's name is Sharon Parker:

1006
01:22:15,451 --> 01:22:18,647
She's a pro: Trust me, Neale:
It shows: Just let me do the talking:

1007
01:22:18,747 --> 01:22:21,235
Okay: What about Warner Books?
We still gonna meet with them?

1008
01:22:21,338 --> 01:22:25,495
Well, I'll circle back next week if I have to,
but Putnam- Putnam is the future:

1009
01:22:25,595 --> 01:22:28,944
Remember, don't react to
anything Sharon says:

1010
01:22:29,051 --> 01:22:31,506
This game is won without emotion:

1011
01:22:31,611 --> 01:22:33,433
- Yeah:
- All right? Okay?

1012
01:22:33,531 --> 01:22:35,603
Now, let's go have some fun:

1013
01:22:35,707 --> 01:22:38,292
[Bob] I’m sure you’re very aware
that we’ve had numerous inquiries: : :

1014
01:22:38,395 --> 01:22:40,664
From other majors
about Neale's book:

1015
01:22:40,763 --> 01:22:43,251
- Any offers?
- Aren't there always, Sharon?

1016
01:22:43,355 --> 01:22:46,671
[Laughs]
Well, that's what makes life interesting:

1017
01:22:46,779 --> 01:22:48,601
Don't you think, Bob?

1018
01:22:48,699 --> 01:22:50,608
Did you have an offer
in mind, Sharon?

1019
01:22:50,715 --> 01:22:53,584
Well, before
we get to that-

1020
01:22:53,691 --> 01:22:56,593
I've been in this business
for over half my life:

1021
01:22:56,698 --> 01:22:59,862
And with the exception of four years
at one of the giant firms: : :

1022
01:22:59,963 --> 01:23:02,232
I've been with Putnam,
and I think even Bob will agree: : :

1023
01:23:02,331 --> 01:23:04,054
That that is pretty rare
in our business:

1024
01:23:04,155 --> 01:23:08,148
People have no loyalty:
Truth is: : :

1025
01:23:08,251 --> 01:23:11,218
The world we live in
is getting tougher:

1026
01:23:11,323 --> 01:23:13,145
Times are changing:

1027
01:23:13,243 --> 01:23:16,504
- How much, Sharon?
- Now, you probably wonder why
I am telling you all of this:

1028
01:23:16,602 --> 01:23:20,977
- How much, Sharon?
- I am telling you all of this because: : :

1029
01:23:21,083 --> 01:23:25,622
There is at Putnam, I believe,
a soul behind the company:

1030
01:23:25,723 --> 01:23:28,144
Yes, we have a lot of titles:

1031
01:23:28,251 --> 01:23:33,269
But we also have the ability to maintain
the soul of a small press like Bob's:

1032
01:23:33,371 --> 01:23:36,600
And when I heard that Hampton
had your title, I was pleased:

1033
01:23:36,699 --> 01:23:39,481
Sharon, how much?

1034
01:23:41,851 --> 01:23:43,891
We are prepared to offer you
one million dollars: : :

1035
01:23:43,994 --> 01:23:46,547
For the worldwide rights
to Conversations With God:

1036
01:23:57,659 --> 01:23:59,731
[Bob] Thank you
for the nice words:

1037
01:23:59,835 --> 01:24:02,420
I really appreciate them,
as I'm sure Neale does:

1038
01:24:02,523 --> 01:24:06,265
And I agree with you:
Putnam does have a soul:

1039
01:24:06,363 --> 01:24:09,080
They also have
buying power:

1040
01:24:09,179 --> 01:24:12,146
And unfortunately at that number,
Hampton Roads will have to pass:

1041
01:24:12,250 --> 01:24:15,512
Thank you for coming out:

1042
01:24:15,611 --> 01:24:17,171
- Neale? Shall we?
- Mm-hmm:

1043
01:24:19,162 --> 01:24:22,261
You know, I thought we were coming here
with a very generous offer today, Bob:

1044
01:24:22,362 --> 01:24:24,751
So did l:

1045
01:24:24,859 --> 01:24:27,826
This guy is booked back-to-back solid
for the next two months, Sharon:

1046
01:24:27,931 --> 01:24:30,102
I can’t print the book fast enough:

1047
01:24:30,203 --> 01:24:34,905
And I think we can both agree,
this is merely the tip of a very big iceberg:

1048
01:24:35,003 --> 01:24:37,817
Come on, Sharon:

1049
01:24:37,914 --> 01:24:41,263
- I thought you said you liked the book:
- I do like the book, Bob:

1050
01:24:41,371 --> 01:24:44,371
And I'm prepared to give you
one million reasons why I like it:

1051
01:24:44,474 --> 01:24:46,711
- We can do a million on our own:
- Oh:

1052
01:24:46,810 --> 01:24:49,145
In fact, we'll send you
a postcard when we do:

1053
01:24:51,323 --> 01:24:53,145
- Neale:
- Mmm:

1054
01:24:53,243 --> 01:24:55,381
Time to go:

1055
01:24:55,482 --> 01:24:58,744

Uh, thank you:

1056
01:24:58,842 --> 01:25:01,079
Thank you:

[Whispers]
What, are you crazy?

1058
01:25:04,763 --> 01:25:06,617
- Wait for it:
- That's a lot of money:

1059
01:25:06,714 --> 01:25:08,754
- I said-
- Bob!

1060
01:25:08,859 --> 01:25:10,964
Wait for it:

So, why do you want the book?

1065
01:25:25,787 --> 01:25:29,584
Well, you might think this is
a little old-fashioned: : :

1066
01:25:29,690 --> 01:25:32,440
But I think your book
could change the world:

1067
01:25:32,538 --> 01:25:34,099
- It’s-
- Yours:

1068
01:25:36,314 --> 01:25:38,583
It's hers, Bob:

1069
01:25:38,682 --> 01:25:41,104
- It's mine:
- Of course:

1070
01:25:41,210 --> 01:25:43,893
- At 1:5 million:
- Yes, Bob:

1071
01:25:43,994 --> 01:25:45,783
At 1:5 million:

1072
01:25:47,611 --> 01:25:49,650
Neale, why don't you pick up
the check for us?

1073
01:25:49,754 --> 01:25:51,827
I'm gonna walk Sharon out,
tie up a few loose ends:

1074
01:25:51,930 --> 01:25:53,752
- I'll be back in a few minutes:
- Okay:

1075
01:25:53,850 --> 01:25:57,428
Bob, thank you:

1076
01:25:58,490 --> 01:26:00,465
Thank you, Sharon:

01:26:00,570 --> 01:26:03,058
Congratulations, Neale:

1079
01:26:05,466 --> 01:26:07,288
- Okay, now, listen-
- Nicely done:

1080
01:26:07,386 --> 01:26:09,874
I’m so glad you think so:
The book cover, we’re keeping that:

1081
01:26:09,978 --> 01:26:11,920
I have some very
definite ideas about it:

1082
01:26:12,027 --> 01:26:13,849
I’ve got the artwork
already laid out:

1083
01:26:13,947 --> 01:26:16,402
I think you just need
to take a look at it:

[Continues, Indistinct]

1085
01:26:25,178 --> 01:26:27,698
Uh, could I have the check, please?

1086
01:26:31,962 --> 01:26:34,483
- Sorry about that:
- Not at all:

1087
01:26:35,706 --> 01:26:38,073
- What're you reading?
- Economics:

1088
01:26:38,170 --> 01:26:40,559
- I have a test in 45 minutes, and I'm dreading it:
- Oh:

1089
01:26:40,667 --> 01:26:43,536
- You in university?
- Twelve credits to go, and I'm done:

I have a son: Between day care
and my other job and class: : :

a little slower in my life:

1094
01:26:53,338 --> 01:26:56,208

- All right:

Thank you:

- Oh, my God!
- My God too:

1100
01:27:22,938 --> 01:27:26,069
This is a small percentage?

1101
01:27:26,170 --> 01:27:29,399
It was a really big check:

1102
01:27:29,498 --> 01:27:32,248
Neale, forgive me:

1103
01:27:32,346 --> 01:27:34,169
I don't wanna seem ungrateful:

1104
01:27:34,266 --> 01:27:36,535
But this is a lot of money:

1105
01:27:36,634 --> 01:27:38,838
I thought you could use it for the-
for the remodeling:

1106
01:27:38,938 --> 01:27:42,233
- You know, you could do it up right:
- Neale, I can't take this:

1107
01:27:43,866 --> 01:27:47,249
Leora, I want you to have this:

1108
01:27:50,395 --> 01:27:53,177
- Also, by the way, we did make a deal, right?
- [Laughs]

1109
01:27:53,275 --> 01:27:55,609
Hmm?

1110
01:27:57,019 --> 01:27:58,841
Tommy, Neale's here!

1111
01:27:58,939 --> 01:28:00,946
- Tell him to come in:
- You're staying for breakfast:

1112
01:28:01,050 --> 01:28:02,905
- We need to celebrate:
- Okay:

01:28:03,962 --> 01:28:05,784

[Birds Chirping]

1115
01:29:48,282 --> 01:29:52,919
Come on, Neale: It'll add one,
maybe two days in Russia:

1116
01:29:53,018 --> 01:29:55,669
- That's all they're asking:
- Well, I don't care what they're asking:

1117
01:29:55,770 --> 01:29:58,159
I'm not gonna do it:
I haven't been home in two weeks:

1118
01:29:58,266 --> 01:30:00,154
- I'm tired:
- Just think about it:

1119
01:30:00,251 --> 01:30:02,105
"Just think about it:"

1120
01:30:02,202 --> 01:30:04,024
Whose side are you on anyway?

1121
01:30:04,122 --> 01:30:06,293
God's:

1122
01:30:08,795 --> 01:30:10,867
[Neale]
You know, I wish l-I wish I knew:

1123
01:30:10,970 --> 01:30:14,101
Um, maybe it’s because
I’ve screwed up so much of my life:

1124
01:30:14,202 --> 01:30:18,958
I don't know: What I do know
is that this is not about me:

1125
01:30:19,066 --> 01:30:21,913
It's- It's about Leora, I think:

1126
01:30:23,195 --> 01:30:25,616
- Um, what-
- I've been to your lectures, Mr.: Walsch:

1127
01:30:25,722 --> 01:30:28,471
And I read your book: : :

1128
01:30:28,570 --> 01:30:32,116
About how God is this friendly god
and the universe is a friendly place:

1129
01:30:32,218 --> 01:30:35,567
And you don't-
you don't believe that:

1130
01:30:35,675 --> 01:30:39,417
I believe your god
is a vengeful god:

1131
01:30:39,515 --> 01:30:41,936
I adopted my son
when he was six months old: : :

1132
01:30:42,042 --> 01:30:44,213
Because I was told I could
never have children:

1133
01:30:44,315 --> 01:30:47,064
And we never told Jimmy
that he was adopted until, um: : :

1134
01:30:47,162 --> 01:30:50,195
He was old enough to
understand what that meant:

1135
01:30:50,298 --> 01:30:53,397
And at 14, we decided it was time:

1136
01:30:54,875 --> 01:30:56,980
His grades fell off:
His whole attitude changed:

1137
01:30:57,082 --> 01:31:00,116
I mean, he got
in trouble at school: It was-

1138
01:31:00,218 --> 01:31:04,113
It was a big mess: And he was angry
at his mother for giving him up:

1139
01:31:04,218 --> 01:31:06,161
He was angry at us for-
for telling him:

1140
01:31:06,266 --> 01:31:08,949
And he was angry at
everything in his life:

1141
01:31:09,050 --> 01:31:11,570
The only way to calm him down: : :

1142
01:31:11,674 --> 01:31:15,416
Was to promise that
when he turned 18:: :

1143
01:31:15,514 --> 01:31:17,619
We would find his mother:

1144
01:31:17,722 --> 01:31:20,951
No matter the cost, no matter
how long it took, we promised him: : :

1145
01:31:21,050 --> 01:31:23,253
That he would
get to meet his mother:

1146
01:31:23,354 --> 01:31:25,459
[Neale]
And: : :

1147
01:31:25,562 --> 01:31:28,431
Did his attitude change?

1148
01:31:28,538 --> 01:31:32,247
Marginally, but, um: : :

1149
01:31:32,346 --> 01:31:36,503
The son we once knew,
the son we loved so dearly was, um-

1150
01:31:36,602 --> 01:31:38,425
was gone:

1151
01:31:38,522 --> 01:31:41,784
And he never
called me "Mother" again:

1152
01:31:45,658 --> 01:31:48,953
And on Jimmy's 18th birthday: : :

1153
01:31:49,050 --> 01:31:51,668
He was killed on a motorcycle:

1154
01:31:53,946 --> 01:31:57,775
A drunk driver killed my Jimmy:

1155
01:32:01,562 --> 01:32:05,970
So please enlighten me on your definition
of a friendly god, Mr.: Walsch: : :

1156
01:32:06,074 --> 01:32:08,823
Because I don’t see a friendly god
putting parents who...

1157
01:32:08,922 --> 01:32:11,672
who love their son unconditionally
through something like this:

1158
01:32:14,202 --> 01:32:16,657
What does your god
