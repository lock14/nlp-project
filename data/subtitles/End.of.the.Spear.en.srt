Meet local girls from Snapchat on 
DMhookup.com

2
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:16,640
So far, we've found
four of'em.

3
00:00:16,742 --> 00:00:19,643
<i>Jim...</i>

4
00:00:19,745 --> 00:00:23,237
<i>Roger, Pete-</i>

5
00:00:23,349 --> 00:00:25,249
What about Ed?

6
00:00:25,351 --> 00:00:30,288
<i>The Quechuas told me that they found him
in the water at the edge of the beach.</i>

7
00:00:30,389 --> 00:00:34,553
<i>By the time that we got there, the water
had come up and carried him away-</i>

8
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:37,151
Marilou, I wanted so badly
to go get him.

9
00:00:37,263 --> 00:00:39,993
- Then there's still a chance?
- No, ma'am.

10
00:00:40,099 --> 00:00:42,363
<i>The Quechuas positively
identified him.</i>

11
00:00:42,468 --> 00:00:45,733
<i>They took his wristwatch
to prove it was him.</i>

12
00:00:53,112 --> 00:00:56,104
- And Nate?
- Well, we found Nate...

13
00:00:59,285 --> 00:01:01,913
<i>in the river right near
Palm Beach.</i>

14
00:01:25,044 --> 00:01:29,572
<i>Nenkiwi lied about the foreigners.!</i>

15
00:01:29,682 --> 00:01:32,173
They did not try to kill us.

16
00:01:32,285 --> 00:01:35,448
<i>- Ask Maengamo.
- Why do you lie?</i>

17
00:01:35,554 --> 00:01:37,283
I saw their guns.

18
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:40,723
<i>I flew in the wood bee.
You should be quiet, Gimade.</i>

19
00:01:45,831 --> 00:01:47,799
Don't spear me, Gikita.

20
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,460
Why should we kill you?

21
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:52,537
<i>Nenkiwi's baby grows in me.</i>

22
00:02:21,667 --> 00:02:23,760
Mincaya-

23
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:28,203
Mincayani, let me stay here.

24
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:34,204
Don't kill me, Mincayani.
Let me live.

25
00:02:46,025 --> 00:02:48,050
Spare the baby,
Mincayani.

26
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,685
Let the baby live,
Mincayani.

27
00:02:59,004 --> 00:03:03,464
He will demand his child.

28
00:03:03,576 --> 00:03:05,476
Maybe he won't.

29
00:03:05,578 --> 00:03:08,103
He won't if you're there.

30
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,918
When does this end?

31
00:03:23,896 --> 00:03:27,627
<i>- Where is Gimade?
- I am your true wife.</i>

32
00:03:29,568 --> 00:03:33,004
Put my son in the earth.

33
00:03:52,525 --> 00:03:54,823
Go.

34
00:04:32,398 --> 00:04:35,026
I'm not your friend anymore.

35
00:04:35,134 --> 00:04:38,399
I'm not anybody's friend anymore.

36
00:05:03,696 --> 00:05:05,596
It didn't work.

37
00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:08,667
Don't judge that too quickly.

38
00:05:12,838 --> 00:05:15,636
You know, hurting a dog won't help.

39
00:05:17,877 --> 00:05:19,777
Come here.

40
00:06:18,137 --> 00:06:20,765
No. This my family!

41
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:32,943
My family...

42
00:06:33,052 --> 00:06:36,647
killed your family.

43
00:06:40,225 --> 00:06:42,659
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, no.

44
00:06:42,761 --> 00:06:44,661
<i>- Sorry.
- Dayumae was never the same...</i>

45
00:06:44,763 --> 00:06:47,459
<i>- after that day.
- It's okay.</i>

46
00:06:47,566 --> 00:06:50,592
<i>The cycle of violence
that her family had lived in...</i>

47
00:06:50,703 --> 00:06:52,694
<i>had come around
to catch her again.</i>

48
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:00,304
<i>She began to talk about
returning to her tribe...</i>

49
00:07:00,412 --> 00:07:04,781
<i>so that they would know
that not all foreigners kill.</i>

50
00:07:08,487 --> 00:07:13,948
<i>It wasn't very long before her family
provided her the opportunity.</i>

51
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:17,688
<i>Her sister Gimade and mother Akawo
were still looking for her.</i>

52
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:27,031
<i>And now they were desperate enough to
take their chances with the foreigners...</i>

53
00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:29,437
<i>just as she had done years before.</i>

54
00:09:26,525 --> 00:09:30,427
We won't let them hurt you.

55
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:32,861
We found spears!

56
00:09:32,965 --> 00:09:35,365
<i>So you want to shoot them?</i>

57
00:09:35,467 --> 00:09:37,435
<i>Is that what you want?</i>

58
00:09:42,407 --> 00:09:46,867
These women are dead. Dead.

59
00:09:53,585 --> 00:09:57,043
We'll take them back to their people.

60
00:10:43,168 --> 00:10:46,433
<i>If Gimade and Akawo
had not been women...</i>

61
00:10:46,538 --> 00:10:49,166
<i>they would've been killed.</i>

62
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:55,213
<i>So Dayumae believed women going to
her family might be shown the same mercy.</i>

63
00:11:21,006 --> 00:11:24,772
Leave quickly!

64
00:11:46,765 --> 00:11:50,462
You look like Dayumae.

65
00:11:50,569 --> 00:11:52,537
But you don't fool me.
You're a spirit.

66
00:11:53,772 --> 00:11:56,138
You look like a man.

67
00:11:56,241 --> 00:11:59,335
But you don't fool me.
You're Mincayani.

68
00:12:00,846 --> 00:12:02,746
She is Dayumae!

69
00:12:02,848 --> 00:12:05,112
She knows our stories.

70
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,647
You hid me in the forest,
Mincayani.

71
00:12:14,426 --> 00:12:17,520
When I ran to the foreigners...

72
00:12:17,629 --> 00:12:21,030
they let me live.

73
00:12:30,075 --> 00:12:32,009
She's a spirit.

74
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:53,430
I don't like this, Mommy.

75
00:12:53,532 --> 00:12:56,831
It's just a game, honey,
to see who can touch the most.

76
00:13:10,816 --> 00:13:13,808
When will the wood bee
family attack us?

77
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:16,251
They will never attack.

78
00:13:16,355 --> 00:13:18,880
Until we are asleep.

79
00:13:18,991 --> 00:13:22,017
I've lived with them.

80
00:13:22,127 --> 00:13:24,220
Can't you see I am well?

81
00:13:25,697 --> 00:13:29,030
The wood bee family
wanted to tell you...

82
00:13:29,134 --> 00:13:31,034
Waengongi doesn't
want anyone to kill.

83
00:13:31,136 --> 00:13:33,434
<i>- Waengongi?
- Waengongi?</i>

84
00:13:33,538 --> 00:13:36,803
Waengongi doesn't
want anyone to kill.

85
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:48,779
How do they know
what Waengongi says?

86
00:13:50,655 --> 00:13:53,590
<i>Waengongi marked his trail
with carvings.</i>

87
00:13:53,692 --> 00:13:57,389
They say we shouldn't kill.

88
00:13:57,496 --> 00:13:59,930
Where are these carvings?

89
00:14:00,032 --> 00:14:02,227
<i>Show them.</i>

90
00:14:04,036 --> 00:14:06,561
The wood bee family
can show you.

91
00:14:06,671 --> 00:14:09,037
Will you let them
live with you?

92
00:14:13,145 --> 00:14:15,636
<i>Why would they live with us...</i>

93
00:14:15,747 --> 00:14:18,716
after we speared their family?

94
00:14:18,817 --> 00:14:21,513
<i>I want to live with the Aenomenani.</i>

95
00:14:22,554 --> 00:14:25,250
With my enemies.

96
00:14:25,357 --> 00:14:27,951
<i>I will see these carvings.</i>

97
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:31,485
If these women cause trouble...

98
00:14:31,596 --> 00:14:33,564
<i>we'll just spear them.</i>

99
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,566
I say spear them now.

100
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:41,164
<i>Mincayani, they'rejust women.</i>

101
00:14:45,577 --> 00:14:47,977
I've seen their house!

102
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,173
Their house of blood!

103
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:53,848
I've touched it!

104
00:14:53,952 --> 00:14:58,855
If she's truly Dayumae...

105
00:14:58,957 --> 00:15:02,154
why not ask about Moipa?

106
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:09,660
Who speared your family?

107
00:15:11,336 --> 00:15:14,601
Who killed your father, Caento?

108
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:18,335
And your baby sister Nemo?

109
00:15:20,512 --> 00:15:24,141
Moipa.
Moipa and the Aenomenani.

110
00:15:27,285 --> 00:15:29,913
Moipa is dead.

111
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:36,826
We killed him.

112
00:15:43,869 --> 00:15:47,703
Just as you
will kill Aenomenani.

113
00:15:51,209 --> 00:15:53,575
I will never...

114
00:15:59,484 --> 00:16:03,716
Then you're not Dayumae.

115
00:16:32,851 --> 00:16:37,117
Why didn't the wood bee men
shoot us?

116
00:16:42,394 --> 00:16:44,294
They came to tell you...

117
00:16:44,396 --> 00:16:46,796
Waengongi has a son.

118
00:16:50,101 --> 00:16:52,569
He was speared...

119
00:16:52,671 --> 00:16:55,799
but he didn't spear back.

120
00:16:55,907 --> 00:16:59,206
So the people spearing him...

121
00:16:59,311 --> 00:17:02,474
would one day live well.

122
00:17:50,962 --> 00:17:53,692
Kimo has fallen under a spell.

123
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,132
Why would the foreigners
tell us not to kill?

124
00:17:58,236 --> 00:18:00,864
They want us to be weak!

125
00:18:00,972 --> 00:18:03,440
I say they're all spirits!

126
00:18:09,814 --> 00:18:11,714
And Kimo better be careful.

127
00:18:11,816 --> 00:18:14,182
<i>Or else.!</i>

128
00:18:23,595 --> 00:18:25,495
The sting ray poisoned you.

129
00:18:27,399 --> 00:18:29,390
Bring my spears.

130
00:18:29,501 --> 00:18:31,492
Drink this, Mincayani.

131
00:18:34,506 --> 00:18:37,373
Bring my spears!

132
00:18:55,527 --> 00:18:57,427
You saw them, Mincayani.

133
00:18:57,529 --> 00:18:59,429
Don't deny it.

134
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:05,501
I saw spirits.

135
00:19:11,309 --> 00:19:13,743
<i>You saw them.</i>

136
00:19:13,845 --> 00:19:16,370
Only spirits!

137
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:25,748
<i>You saw them.</i>

138
00:19:26,691 --> 00:19:28,955
You saw!

139
00:19:51,516 --> 00:19:53,416
<i>Kimo shouldn't
help these women.</i>

140
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:57,420
The Aenomenani will say...

141
00:19:57,522 --> 00:19:59,990
"The foreigners have tamed them. "

142
00:20:00,091 --> 00:20:03,652
Kimo's already tame.

143
00:20:03,762 --> 00:20:07,960
After this, he'll build
a house for their God.

144
00:20:08,066 --> 00:20:10,125
Then he'll die in it.

145
00:20:13,371 --> 00:20:15,362
Just look at
Kimo's face!

146
00:20:17,442 --> 00:20:20,309
Every day a spirit
possesses him more.

147
00:20:26,785 --> 00:20:29,310
The women are also changing.

148
00:20:43,168 --> 00:20:45,864
They say this house
will be your grave.

149
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:49,633
What do you say, Mincayani?

150
00:20:49,741 --> 00:20:54,269
You no longer know your family.

151
00:20:56,648 --> 00:20:59,082
You must be blind.

152
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:12,123
<i>They're coming.! More foreigners.!</i>

153
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:14,198
<i>They're coming.!</i>

154
00:21:20,972 --> 00:21:23,031
Oh, my God!

155
00:21:27,846 --> 00:21:31,441
Good to see you!

156
00:21:31,549 --> 00:21:34,017
Hi!

157
00:21:34,118 --> 00:21:37,417
Marj, Kathy and Stevie.

158
00:21:37,522 --> 00:21:40,184
They are Rachel's family.

159
00:21:43,094 --> 00:21:46,188
Oh, that's boiled
plantain mash and water.

160
00:21:46,297 --> 00:21:48,322
<i>Oh, I have so many stories...</i>

161
00:21:48,433 --> 00:21:51,197
<i>about when I first came to visit
Aunt Rachel and the Waodani.</i>

162
00:21:51,302 --> 00:21:54,362
She is a girl with short hair.

163
00:21:54,472 --> 00:21:56,372
No, he is a boy.

164
00:21:56,474 --> 00:21:59,739
<i>Let's just say there are
some things you never forget.</i>

165
00:21:59,844 --> 00:22:02,369
I will see for myself.

166
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:09,545
You're right. He's a boy.

167
00:22:14,392 --> 00:22:17,520
<i>According to Waodani tradition...</i>

168
00:22:17,629 --> 00:22:21,998
<i>as my father's oldest son, I would be
responsible for avenging his death.</i>

169
00:22:24,502 --> 00:22:28,598
<i>So Aunt Rachel warned me never to
appear too interested in the particulars.</i>

170
00:22:31,476 --> 00:22:35,378
<i>She, herself,had no idea
who the actual killers were.</i>

171
00:22:38,249 --> 00:22:41,241
<i>But, of course,
I couldn't help but wonder.</i>

172
00:22:43,154 --> 00:22:47,250
<i>And that was
when I first saw Mincayani.</i>

173
00:22:47,358 --> 00:22:50,418
<i>I remember feeling
like I irritated him.</i>

174
00:23:23,728 --> 00:23:25,753
Something's dead.

175
00:23:34,539 --> 00:23:36,439
I'll come back for you.

176
00:23:49,787 --> 00:23:52,847
<i>Mingi.!</i>

177
00:23:58,596 --> 00:24:00,826
Aenomenani!

178
00:24:21,886 --> 00:24:25,049
The Aenomenani
have speared Mingi.

179
00:24:26,791 --> 00:24:29,419
<i>We found their tracks.</i>

180
00:24:29,527 --> 00:24:31,654
I say we take spears...

181
00:24:33,231 --> 00:24:35,631
and follow them.

182
00:24:39,404 --> 00:24:41,338
We will not be weak!

183
00:24:43,675 --> 00:24:46,109
<i>We will kill.</i>

184
00:24:47,378 --> 00:24:49,369
Bring us drink.

185
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:01,154
<i>I will not kill the Aenomenani.</i>

186
00:25:03,294 --> 00:25:05,558
Following Waengongi's carvings...

187
00:25:07,732 --> 00:25:10,428
I will walk his trail.

188
00:25:52,844 --> 00:25:55,677
<i>- How many?
- Very many.</i>

189
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:57,680
Why don't they attack?

190
00:25:57,782 --> 00:26:00,307
Maybe they don't know
our warriors are gone.

191
00:26:03,387 --> 00:26:05,446
They are my family.

192
00:26:05,556 --> 00:26:09,856
If I talk to them, maybe we'll live.

193
00:26:11,362 --> 00:26:14,092
I'll go with her.

194
00:26:14,198 --> 00:26:16,632
If you go, Kimo,
they will spear.

195
00:26:24,809 --> 00:26:27,073
Are we going to run?

196
00:26:28,813 --> 00:26:31,441
No, Stevie boy.

197
00:26:38,055 --> 00:26:40,080
<i>We no kill.</i>

198
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:43,550
Waengongi say, "No. "

199
00:26:43,661 --> 00:26:45,686
<i>You no kill.</i>

200
00:26:45,797 --> 00:26:50,860
<i>Even spearing us, we no spear you.</i>

201
00:26:55,573 --> 00:26:57,564
<i>Aenomenani very angry.</i>

202
00:26:57,675 --> 00:27:02,635
<i>They say we make fever.</i>

203
00:27:03,781 --> 00:27:05,749
<i>They die.</i>

204
00:27:15,026 --> 00:27:17,187
Ompodae say, "No. "

205
00:27:17,295 --> 00:27:19,763
<i>We live well.</i>

206
00:27:42,253 --> 00:27:45,620
<i>Ompodae and Dawa pleaded
with their family for hours.</i>

207
00:27:45,723 --> 00:27:49,921
<i>In the end, it was the Aenomenani's
sickness that helped turn the tide.</i>

208
00:27:51,662 --> 00:27:57,191
<i>In the darkness,just before dawn,
they became too weak to attack.</i>

209
00:28:22,693 --> 00:28:24,593
Dayumae.

210
00:28:28,065 --> 00:28:30,795
My family has fever.

211
00:28:30,902 --> 00:28:33,097
<i>Some are already dead.
More are dying.</i>

212
00:28:33,204 --> 00:28:35,104
Take them to the huts.

213
00:28:35,206 --> 00:28:38,232
Bring them drink.
I'll get medicine.

214
00:28:43,014 --> 00:28:46,711
Help us.
My family has fever.

215
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:51,548
Help us. They will die
if we do not help.

216
00:29:27,058 --> 00:29:29,993
Shell, this is Tiwaeno.
We have an emergency. Over.

217
00:29:30,094 --> 00:29:32,528
<i>Tiwaeno, Tiwaeno, this is Shell.</i>

218
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:35,064
<i>What's wrong, Rachel? Over.</i>

219
00:29:35,166 --> 00:29:37,634
Kimo and Dawa have returned
with the Aenomenani. All of them.

220
00:29:37,735 --> 00:29:40,966
They have polio.
They're dying. Over.

221
00:29:41,072 --> 00:29:44,473
<i>Roger. You'll have to
quarantine the village, Rachel.</i>

222
00:29:47,011 --> 00:29:48,911
<i>You read?</i>

223
00:29:49,013 --> 00:29:52,505
We read you, Frank.
Tell everyone to pray.

224
00:30:00,691 --> 00:30:05,128
Look at Kimo.
He used to be a great warrior.

225
00:30:07,298 --> 00:30:09,664
No matter.

226
00:30:09,767 --> 00:30:15,637
Kimo brings our enemies
to our spears.

227
00:30:44,168 --> 00:30:46,193
What's he shouting?

228
00:30:46,303 --> 00:30:50,364
<i>- He's saying, "No food. Children will die. "
- Mincayani.!</i>

229
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,608
<i>The quarantine meant
we couldn't leave the village.</i>

230
00:30:59,717 --> 00:31:02,117
<i>No one could walk
in with supplies.</i>

231
00:31:06,991 --> 00:31:10,483
<i>I felt trapped in a place that wasn't my home.</i>

232
00:31:10,594 --> 00:31:14,394
<i>Little did I know that Mincayani
felt trapped as well.</i>

233
00:31:14,498 --> 00:31:16,762
<i>And this place was his home.</i>

234
00:31:47,731 --> 00:31:50,791
<i>How are you bearing up, Rachel?</i>

235
00:31:50,901 --> 00:31:53,802
<i>The monkeys and wild boar seem to
have abandoned this part of thejungle.</i>

236
00:31:53,904 --> 00:31:55,838
Thanks for the drop. Over.

237
00:32:04,315 --> 00:32:06,715
<i>This is all the medicine we have in Shell.</i>

238
00:32:06,817 --> 00:32:09,877
<i>We're bringing more
down from Quito.</i>

239
00:32:09,987 --> 00:32:12,751
And we need more advice on
how to keep 'em breathing.

240
00:32:12,857 --> 00:32:15,417
Maybe you could talk to Dr. Wally?

241
00:32:15,526 --> 00:32:19,292
I did. You just got to
keep them moving on those teeter-totters.

242
00:32:19,396 --> 00:32:21,523
But their lungs are still filling!

243
00:32:21,632 --> 00:32:25,500
<i>We'll keep you in food and medicine
until the quarantine is lifted.</i>

244
00:32:25,603 --> 00:32:28,231
<i>Tell Marj
Marilou says little Phil is fine.</i>

245
00:32:30,541 --> 00:32:32,475
<i>We're all praying for you.</i>

246
00:33:02,206 --> 00:33:05,004
Mincayani, if I don't rock
the boy dies.

247
00:33:35,873 --> 00:33:40,810
<i>Bibanka, when you sleep,
I'll tie many to you...</i>

248
00:33:40,911 --> 00:33:43,607
to carry you up to the clouds.

249
00:33:43,714 --> 00:33:46,877
Don't listen.
He's a dreamer.

250
00:33:53,591 --> 00:33:55,616
Kimo shocks me...

251
00:33:55,726 --> 00:33:58,718
because he's keeping
those killers alive.

252
00:34:01,432 --> 00:34:03,832
And Dayumae...

253
00:34:05,202 --> 00:34:08,763
They no longer fear
the Great Boa.

254
00:34:14,411 --> 00:34:16,572
Just call them termites.

255
00:35:28,285 --> 00:35:33,348
<i>Mincayani, we must
put her in the ground.</i>

256
00:35:34,692 --> 00:35:37,957
<i>Can one so small
jump the Great Boa?</i>

257
00:35:46,937 --> 00:35:49,565
Or will she become a termite?

258
00:35:51,875 --> 00:35:54,776
<i>Do you know what
the ancient ones said?</i>

259
00:35:55,879 --> 00:35:58,473
To die is nothing.

260
00:36:00,584 --> 00:36:04,020
To jump the Great Boa
is everything.

261
00:36:11,962 --> 00:36:15,921
By spearing,
we become strong.

262
00:36:17,835 --> 00:36:23,432
With enough strength,
we can all jump the Great Boa.

263
00:36:32,282 --> 00:36:34,773
But now Kimo...

264
00:36:36,019 --> 00:36:37,919
and Dayumae...

265
00:36:42,292 --> 00:36:45,056
and the one they
call Waengongi...

266
00:36:45,162 --> 00:36:48,325
are leading our family
to a place...

267
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:52,194
where we will all be termites...

268
00:36:52,302 --> 00:36:55,271
forever!

269
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:04,237
<i>But I will fight them...</i>

270
00:37:04,348 --> 00:37:06,646
<i>to my last breath.!</i>

271
00:37:08,485 --> 00:37:10,612
If you kill again...

272
00:37:10,721 --> 00:37:12,746
you will kill us all.

273
00:37:40,484 --> 00:37:43,851
<i>After eight weeks,
the quarantine was lifted.</i>

274
00:37:43,954 --> 00:37:46,787
<i>My mother and sister
and I could finally go home.</i>

275
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:51,919
<i>The teeter-totters had stopped...</i>

276
00:37:52,029 --> 00:37:56,022
<i>and with them, the endless cycle of revenge.</i>

277
00:37:58,302 --> 00:38:02,136
<i>- The Waodani had found a reason
to live differently.</i>

278
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:04,639
<i>And in the end...</i>

279
00:38:04,741 --> 00:38:08,336
<i>that seemed to be what
so many of them were waiting for.</i>

280
00:38:08,445 --> 00:38:10,709
I'll miss you so much.

281
00:38:10,814 --> 00:38:13,009
You'll just miss the manioc.

282
00:38:15,752 --> 00:38:18,118
I'd like to say good-bye
to Mincayani.

283
00:38:20,624 --> 00:38:22,990
It's important to do
what's in your heart, Stevie.

284
00:38:51,455 --> 00:38:56,950
I hope to return one day and see you.

285
00:38:57,995 --> 00:39:02,091
If I don't see you in this place...

286
00:39:02,199 --> 00:39:05,862
<i>I hope to see you...</i>

287
00:39:05,969 --> 00:39:09,530
in Waengongi's place.

288
00:39:11,842 --> 00:39:14,538
My father always hoped...

289
00:39:15,979 --> 00:39:21,884
<i>that we would be sincere friends.</i>

290
00:39:31,461 --> 00:39:34,055
<i>After I left Mincayani...</i>

291
00:39:34,164 --> 00:39:36,826
<i>I started a new life that would take me
to the United States.</i>

292
00:39:39,369 --> 00:39:42,202
<i>Aunt Rachel and I kept in touch...</i>

293
00:39:42,306 --> 00:39:44,467
<i>and occasionally
I'd visit in the summers.</i>

294
00:39:48,145 --> 00:39:50,841
<i>She spent the rest ofher life
with the Waodani.</i>

295
00:39:55,018 --> 00:39:59,682

296
Waodani Territory

297
00:40:01,291 --> 00:40:03,316
<i>I was living
with my family in Florida...</i>

298
00:40:03,427 --> 00:40:05,987
<i>when I got the news
that Aunt Rachel had died.</i>

299
00:40:07,998 --> 00:40:12,867
<i>It didn't come as a surprise.
We had known about her cancer.</i>

300
00:40:16,873 --> 00:40:20,639
<i>And though she came
from a large family in the states...</i>

301
00:40:20,744 --> 00:40:23,235
<i>she wanted to be buried
with the Waodani...</i>

302
00:40:23,347 --> 00:40:25,645
<i>who she considered
to be family as well.</i>

303
00:40:25,749 --> 00:40:30,652
<i>So my wife Ginny and I traveled
to Ecuador to honor her request.</i>

304
00:41:24,808 --> 00:41:29,905
- What are you thinking?
- How do you...

305
00:41:30,013 --> 00:41:32,038
weigh a life?

306
00:41:35,919 --> 00:41:38,080
Faith?

307
00:41:51,501 --> 00:41:54,026
Rachel wanted you to live with us.

308
00:42:02,446 --> 00:42:05,938
She told us you would.

309
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:14,653
I live far, far away.

310
00:42:15,826 --> 00:42:19,262
My wife and children...

311
00:42:19,362 --> 00:42:22,889
have never lived in the jungle.

312
00:42:28,672 --> 00:42:31,539
I will visit you often.

313
00:42:31,641 --> 00:42:33,939
Your father's buried here.

314
00:42:34,044 --> 00:42:36,137
Rachel's buried here.

315
00:42:36,246 --> 00:42:39,909
<i>Why not live where
your family is buried?</i>

316
00:42:49,226 --> 00:42:51,456
It isn't possible.

317
00:42:53,363 --> 00:42:59,302
<i>Our children must
understand outside ways...</i>

318
00:43:00,804 --> 00:43:02,897
and our family must show them.

319
00:43:04,908 --> 00:43:07,536
Are you not our family?

320
00:43:43,113 --> 00:43:46,810
Steve didn't hear Kimo's words.

321
00:43:48,985 --> 00:43:51,419
He still needs to know.

322
00:45:21,511 --> 00:45:24,742
<i>All Mincayani said was
there was something I needed to see.</i>

323
00:45:26,516 --> 00:45:28,916
<i>No other explanation was offered.</i>

324
00:45:34,357 --> 00:45:38,521
<i>And so ourjourney
that had spanned two worlds...</i>

325
00:45:38,628 --> 00:45:41,688
<i>bridged the Stone Age
and 21 st century...</i>

326
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:45,360
<i>finally led us here...</i>

327
00:45:45,468 --> 00:45:48,130
<i>down the lonely Curraray River.</i>

328
00:46:09,292 --> 00:46:12,523
That's his plane!

329
00:46:33,650 --> 00:46:35,550
Is this it?

330
00:46:37,687 --> 00:46:40,747
Is this where-
Is this where it happened?

331
00:47:02,746 --> 00:47:04,976
<i>It happened here.</i>

332
00:47:13,156 --> 00:47:15,954
They didn't shoot us!

333
00:47:26,102 --> 00:47:28,730
There's more you need to know.

334
00:47:42,819 --> 00:47:45,617
<i>I saw them.</i>

335
00:47:47,123 --> 00:47:49,990
Your father saw them also.

336
00:47:57,467 --> 00:47:59,367
What?

337
00:48:02,138 --> 00:48:05,073
What did he see?
Tell me!

338
00:48:38,308 --> 00:48:40,674
Your father...

339
00:48:42,512 --> 00:48:44,844
was a special man.

340
00:48:46,950 --> 00:48:50,147
I saw him jump the Great Boa...

341
00:48:52,122 --> 00:48:54,750
while he was still alive!

342
00:49:05,235 --> 00:49:08,102
I speared your father!

343
00:49:28,958 --> 00:49:30,858
What?

344
00:49:35,598 --> 00:49:37,793
What?

345
00:49:41,638 --> 00:49:45,039
Do it!

346
00:50:10,967 --> 00:50:13,231
No one...

347
00:50:15,071 --> 00:50:16,698
took...

348
00:50:18,408 --> 00:50:20,899
my father's life.

349
00:50:23,546 --> 00:50:27,243
He gave it.

350
00:50:40,563 --> 00:50:44,465
<i>My father lost his life
at the end of the spear...</i>

351
00:50:44,567 --> 00:50:48,367
<i>and it was at
the end of the spear...</i>

352
00:50:48,471 --> 00:50:51,065
<i>that Mincayani and I found ours.</i>

353
00:50:54,577 --> 00:50:56,807
<i>It's true that my dad
and his four friends...</i>

354
00:50:56,913 --> 00:51:01,941
<i>were not given the privilege of watching
their children and grandchildren grow up.</i>

355
00:51:02,051 --> 00:51:05,316
<i>But Mincayani is a grandfather.</i>

356
00:51:05,421 --> 00:51:11,189
<i>It's the first time in Waodani history
they've ever had so many grandfathers.</i>

357
00:51:12,996 --> 00:51:18,457
<i>He's not only a grandfather to his own
children, he's a grandfather to mine.</i>

358
00:51:20,803 --> 00:51:23,271
<i>My dad would've liked that.</i>

359
00:51:25,041 --> 00:51:29,341
<i>Through the years, people could
always identify with our loss.</i>

360
00:51:31,347 --> 00:51:34,783
<i>But they could never imagine the way
that we would experience gain.</i>

361
00:52:23,966 --> 00:52:29,268
<i>Mincaye got to come to the states,
and that has started these visits.</i>

362
00:52:29,372 --> 00:52:33,570
<i>He said some of the foreigners are
so nice that even when you're driving...</i>

363
00:52:33,676 --> 00:52:37,840
<i>you just stop by their houses
and you go to one of the-</i>

364
00:52:37,947 --> 00:52:40,507
<i>one of the openings
in their walls...</i>

365
00:52:40,616 --> 00:52:45,019
<i>and he said, "Theyjust open it for you,
and then they start giving you food. "</i>

366
00:52:45,121 --> 00:52:47,419
and it's already hot,
and it's already cooked and stuff.

367
00:52:47,523 --> 00:52:50,287
He said, I see those foreigners
very, very well.

368
00:52:50,393 --> 00:52:53,294
<i>When Mincaye came back
from the states the first time...</i>

369
00:52:53,396 --> 00:52:57,799
he told the people that the foreigners
are really big and fat...

370
00:52:57,900 --> 00:53:00,528
<i>because even when they go walking,
they don't move their feet.</i>

371
00:53:00,636 --> 00:53:03,662
<i>Theyjust get on the trail,
and the trail moves.</i>

372
00:53:03,773 --> 00:53:07,504
Well, Ompodae, his wife, said,
"Oh, you're talking wild. "

373
00:53:12,782 --> 00:53:15,910
<i>Mincayejust kept saying,
"That's why all the foreigners are fat. "</i>

374
00:53:16,018 --> 00:53:20,182
<i>They don't walk. They don't climb.
They don't make gardens.</i>

375
00:53:20,289 --> 00:53:22,257
When they got to that one...

376
00:53:22,358 --> 00:53:26,419
Ompodae, she just said,
"Well, how are they gonna live then?"

377
00:53:26,529 --> 00:53:29,396
<i>Mincaye said, "They have
these big food houses. "</i>

378
00:53:29,499 --> 00:53:32,935
<i>And he said,
"There's just piles of food. "</i>

379
00:53:38,174 --> 00:53:41,234
<i>First, there's
these young people...</i>

380
00:53:41,344 --> 00:53:43,972
<i>and they're standing
at the place where you go out.</i>

381
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:46,173
And you smile as big as you can...

382
00:53:46,282 --> 00:53:48,307
and he said, "They pretend
like they're not seeing you. "

383
00:53:48,418 --> 00:53:50,818
<i>Then after a little while-
Then they look at you, and they smile.</i>

384
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:53,252
And he said,
"When they smile, boom...

385
00:53:53,356 --> 00:53:55,847
<i>you can just go
and take all the food with you. "</i>

386
00:53:55,958 --> 00:54:00,452
<i>I said, "Well, it's kind oflike that. "
So I took out my credit card and said...</i>

387
00:54:00,563 --> 00:54:03,054
<i>"First you have to give them
something like this. "</i>

388
00:54:03,166 --> 00:54:07,762
Mincaye looked at them and smiled.
"They just give it right back to you. "

389
00:54:11,307 --> 00:54:13,207
<i>Ompodae started griping at me.</i>

390
00:54:13,309 --> 00:54:16,540
<i>She said, "Babae, what do you mean
sending Mincaye back here?</i>

391
00:54:16,646 --> 00:54:20,104
He was so fat that
whenever I'd say...

392
00:54:20,216 --> 00:54:23,481
<i>'Mincaye, go out
and bring some meat back for me"...</i>

393
00:54:23,586 --> 00:54:27,147
<i>She said, he wouldjust go out, and
he'd find a tree, and he'djust-</i>

394
