1
00:01:33,135 --> 00:01:35,886
They call them
"the haunted shores"...

2
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:38,556
these stretches of Devonshire
and Cornwall and Ireland...

3
00:01:38,557 --> 00:01:41,434
which rear up against
the westward ocean.

4
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:46,355
Mists gather here, and sea
fog, and eerie stories.

5
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:50,359
That's not because there are more ghosts
here than in other places, mind you.

6
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:55,156
It's just that people who live
hereabouts are strangely aware of them.

7
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:58,534
You see, day and night,
year in, year out...

8
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:01,996
they listen to the pound
and stir of the waves.

9
00:02:01,997 --> 00:02:04,832
There's life and death
in that restless sound...

10
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:07,293
and eternity too.

11
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:10,963
If you listen to it long enough,
all your senses are sharpened.

12
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,424
You come by strange instincts.

13
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:17,595
You get to recognize a peculiar cold...
which is the first warning.

14
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:21,057
A cold which is no mere matter
of degrees Fahrenheit...

15
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:25,811
but a draining of warmth from the
vital centers of the living.

16
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:28,230
Local people tell me they
would have felt it...

17
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:31,817
even outside that locked door.
We didn't.

18
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:34,195
They can't understand why we
didn't know what it meant...

19
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:36,781
when our dog wouldn't
go up those stairs.

20
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:40,102
Animals see the blasted
things, it appears.

21
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:44,538
Well, my sister Pamela and I knew
nothing about such matters...

22
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,040
not then, we didn't.

23
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,084
We had the disadvantage
of being Londoners...

24
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:50,836
just down for a fortnight's rest.

25
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:55,192
That tenth day of May 1937
was the end of our holiday.

26
00:03:07,396 --> 00:03:09,897
We seem to be in somebody's garden.

27
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:14,443
What was somebody's garden.
What a marvelous old house!

28
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,487
We'd better get out before
we're had up for trespassing.

29
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:20,764
- Where on earth did we leave the car?
- That direction, I think.

30
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:33,526
Look, a squirrel.

31
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:36,859
- Grab Bobby!
- Too late. Bobby, come back here!

32
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:41,572
- You bad dog!
- Bobby!

33
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:51,647
He's got the poor little
squirrel trapped. He'll kill it.

34
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:55,673
My dear, sweet sister, it's more likely
he's having his way with our Bobby.

35
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:05,100
Fine way to spend a holiday...
chasing a dog!

36
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:18,033
- Where is he?
- Under here, I think.

37
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:21,886
I thought you had him.

38
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,888
He had me. There he goes!
Hang on to Bobby!

39
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:25,457
I can't!

40
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:36,209
Oh, well played, sir!

41
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:42,933
- Do you suppose he can get out?
- Certainly. He's on the roof by now.

42
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:47,995
That's a smart dog.
He'll be back any minute.

43
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:50,247
Rick, have you noticed anything?

44
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:52,374
Only that I'm in no shape
to join the hunting set.

45
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:57,276
No, I mean this house. It's the
loveliest thing I ever saw.

46
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:02,551
- Look at that staircase.
- Oh, boy, what banisters for sliding!

47
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,553
- Oh, Rick.
- What is it?

48
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:08,474
Your saying that, and the
house... it took me back.

49
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:11,393
- Yeah, it's quite a bit like the...
- The rose bowl there...

50
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:13,854
the grandfather clock there...

51
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:17,066
and Mother in her best gray
moire sweeping down the stairs.

52
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:19,985
- You'll be howling in a minute. Come out.
- Not on your life.

53
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:24,031
I'm going to see the rest of this.
Come on. Let's pretend we're buying it.

54
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:26,033
I'll toss you for the
bedroom with the best view.

55
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:28,762
They've all got best views.

56
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:33,791
How lovely! Why does it
make me feel I'm on a boat?

57
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:37,962
It's the light on the ceiling. That's the
sea. It's nice to wake up and see that.

58
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:40,631
Oh, how I do hate living
in a London flat.

59
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:43,843
If you're brought up in an old
house, you always hanker for one.

60
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:46,572
It's stuck. You try it.

61
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:52,184
It's locked. Family
skeletons, probably.

62
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,436
Oh, what a bore.

63
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:56,631
Rick, the bathroom!

64
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:03,050
An open fire while you bathe.
What luxury!

65
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:06,949
You know, this is a
Saturday-night-only bathroom.

66
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:11,161
You boiled yourself as red as a lobster,
then hurried to bed to avoid a chill.

67
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:13,080
- Rick.
- What?

68
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:16,500
I've had one of my feelings.
We're really going to buy this house.

69
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:19,753
Oh, yes? Did your feeling tell you
what we're going to buy it with?

70
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:23,173
If we both put in everything
we have, maybe we can get it.

71
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:27,094
It's terribly out of the way, and
it hasn't been lived in for years.

72
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:31,098
But what would we do with it? We can't
drive nearly 300 miles just for weekends.

73
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:34,685
We'll live here all the time,
and you'll work at your music.

74
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:37,605
My poor lunatic sister,
I happen to have a job.

75
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:39,773
Yes, and what a job...
going to concerts...

76
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:42,568
and telling your readers
how bad the music was.

77
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:45,070
It's not good enough,
Rick. Chuck it.

78
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:48,073
Down here you'd write your own music,
as you always should have done...

79
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,117
and as you've always wanted to.

80
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:53,704
Rick, it isn't as if you were
even a good music critic.

81
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:57,124
Well, thank you very much.
Anyway, I get paid hard cash.

82
00:06:57,125 --> 00:07:00,377
Well, doesn't the idea
attract you at all?

83
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:02,004
Attract me?

84
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:04,465
Look, you come out of here.
You're dangerous.

85
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:08,010
Don't you know how rare
houses like this are?

86
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:11,138
- I like the banisters.
- How Lizzie'd love that kitchen.

87
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:13,307
That little beach
must belong to it.

88
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:15,643
It's in good condition too.
Not a sign of damp.

89
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:18,604
- We'll get our furniture out of storage
- Be calm, Pamela.

90
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,564
A change like this would have
to be discussed for months.

91
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:24,026
Nonsense. Important decisions
have to be made quickly.

92
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:26,987
Well, my paper has asked
me to do a series...

93
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:29,657
"Lives of the great musicians."
Reading time: two minutes.

94
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:32,910
- There you are. That'll feed us.
- Yes, until I run out of musicians.

95
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:35,204
Anyway, how do we know
the place is for sale?

96
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:38,900
Rick, life isn't as cruel
as that. It's got to be.

97
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49,218
Now remember, Pam, no
signs of keenness.

98
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:52,323
We're just mildly
interested. Mildly.

99
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:56,350
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

100
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:58,936
We'd like to see Commander
Beech, if we may.

101
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:02,606
- He's not in at the moment.
- Could we wait for him?

102
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:04,675
Won't you come in?

103
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:15,869
There's a fire in the study.

104
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:19,691
I think I can catch my
grandfather by telephone.

105
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,129
- Who shall I say wants to see him?
- He wouldn't know our name.

106
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:28,924
It's Fitzgerald. My sister, Pamela
Fitzgerald, and I'm Roderick Fitzgerald.

107
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,217
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

108
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:33,137
I'm Stella Meredith.
Won't you sit down?

109
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:34,805
Thank you.

110
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:39,002
Oh, not in that chair!
It's got a lumpy seat.

111
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,589
- Do you mind?
- Oh, no.

112
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,610
- Oh, dear. Will this do?
- Thank you.

113
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:51,405
We're an awfully un-smoking house.

114
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:55,701
Grandfather had a cigar blown straight down
his throat once when he was on the foredeck.

115
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,725
He lost his taste for tobacco.

116
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,831
Can I help in any way?

117
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:03,500
We wanted to talk to the commander
about a house he owns...

118
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,419
on top of the cliff.

119
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,754
- Windward?
- Yes.

120
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:10,632
You see, we've fallen head
over heels in love with...

121
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:13,761
- I mean, it might just do for us.
- Really?

122
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:16,430
We understand from Mrs. Brown
at the inn ifs for sale.

123
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:21,435
Mrs. Brown is mistaken. Sorry you've
been put to the trouble of coming here.

124
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:24,021
Perhaps if we could speak to
your grandfather about it...

125
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:26,023
It wouldn't be the slightest use.

126
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:28,776
I'm sorry, but there's really
no point in your waiting.

127
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:31,005
Stella, are you there?

128
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:34,573
Yes, Grandfather.

129
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,551
In here.

130
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:44,166
Well, what is it?

131
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:47,002
Some people who came here
by mistake, Grandfather.

132
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,170
They're just leaving.

133
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:50,380
We heard that Windward
House is for sale.

134
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:52,758
Yes, it is.

135
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:55,260
Won't you sit down?
I'll be with you in a moment.

136
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,534
Thank you very much.

137
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,560
Grandfather, please.

138
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:06,730
I thought I made myself quite
clear on this point, Stella.

139
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:09,858
- Yes, Grandfather...
- I don't understand you.

140
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:12,319
A house you haven't lived in
since you were a child...

141
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,863
a piece of property we
can't afford to maintain.

142
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:17,533
But it was my
mother's house. It's...

143
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:20,994
- I can't put it into words. It's...
- Nonsense.

144
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:23,189
Grandfather, please!

145
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:45,519
I don't believe many
repairs will be necessary.

146
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,229
The roof is sound...

147
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:50,607
and the walls have withstood the
Atlantic gales for two centuries.

148
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,151
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

149
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:56,113
There was a considerable sum spent
on the house some 20 years ago...

150
00:10:56,114 --> 00:11:01,118
- when I gave it to my daughter.
- I understand. Well, I'm sorry...

151
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:04,788
but I'm afraid £1,200
is our absolute limit.

152
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:07,166
- Is that a definite offer?
- Yes.

153
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,960
And you would pay the
entire sum immediately?

154
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:12,530
- You mean you'd sell for that?
- Yes.

155
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:18,177
I suppose you ought to have the
property surveyed before we...

156
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:21,138
- Oh, Rick.
- There's no need to get suspicious.

157
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:23,599
The house is worth far
more than that...

158
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,018
but I have a very young
granddaughter...

159
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:29,479
and £1,200 in the bank for her
would ease my mind considerably.

160
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,799
We understand perfectly.

161
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:34,985
And you'd not be nervous
in such a lonely house?

162
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:36,820
No, indeed.

163
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:41,116
Or of the wind at nights?
It plays odd tricks in old houses.

164
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:43,076
Are you trying to tell us
the house is haunted?

165
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:46,272
No, Miss Fitzgerald.
No house is haunted.

166
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:51,793
But I had some tenants five years ago
who complained of... disturbances.

167
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:55,255
What was the trouble? Ladies carrying
their heads under their arms?

168
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:58,258
I declined to discuss it
and canceled the lease.

169
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:02,262
- But I couldn't cancel a sale.
- We wouldn't want you to.

170
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:05,682
One does feel that a story like
that should bring the price down.

171
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:09,853
I've already made a very considerable
reduction, Mr. Fitzgerald.

172
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:12,105
Perhaps we both need time
to think the matter over.

173
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:15,567
- But our offer's definite. Isn't it, Rick?
- Oh, yes.

174
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,762
Very well, then. I accept it.

175
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:22,407
Title deeds and checks will be
exchanged by our solicitors.

176
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:27,184
In the meantime, I have your
word, and you have mine.

177
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:32,106
Well, it's wonderfully simple
to buy a house, isn't it?

178
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:40,114
- Pam, where are you?
- Here I am. Look, our own roses.

179
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:48,183
Rick, it's all ours.
Isn't it wonderful?

180
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:50,310
You know, it's bigger
than I thought.

181
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:52,771
I can't wait to see what's
in that Bluebeard room.

182
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:57,776
Probably the housemaid's cupboard.
Slops, mops, dripping taps.

183
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:00,612
I wonder how soon we can get
cleaners and painters in.

184
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:03,448
You'll go back to London,
of course, while I stay here.

185
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,325
Rolled up in a blanket
like a squaw?

186
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:09,431
At the inn, idiot, until
you ship me the furniture.

187
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:14,001
Did the old boy tell
you why it was locked?

188
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:16,480
Never thought to ask him.

189
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:24,469
Well, now we know.

190
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:28,557
- It's the one ugly room in the house.
- Oh, it's not so bad.

191
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:31,518
That window, it's like
a cucumber frame.

192
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,729
They put that in later to
make a painter's studio.

193
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:37,441
Even the view doesn't cheer it up.

194
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:40,027
- What'll we do with it?
- My workroom, of course.

195
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:43,322
It's ideal. Put the piano over
there with shelves for music...

196
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:46,616
plenty of space to walk up and down,
manuscripts all over the floor...

197
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:50,120
hot pincers to tear the flesh from people
who keep telling me luncheon is ready...

198
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:52,940
stacks of checks from
my publishers, and...

199
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:57,753
- Do you think this room is damp?
- It needs airing.

200
00:13:57,754 --> 00:14:00,797
It's funny it should strike so cold
in here after such a warm day.

201
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:03,572
- Oh, law.
- What, Rick?

202
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:08,347
I suddenly felt
completely flattened.

203
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:11,266
Do you suppose I'll ever be able to
write any music here or anywhere?

204
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,977
What on earth are
you talking about?

205
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:17,147
You don't suppose we've made the
most howling mistake, do you?

206
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:19,399
Rick, have we?

207
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,235
Why did the commander suddenly
come down in his price like that?

208
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:25,697
The disturbances. Rumors like that
are dynamite if you're selling a place.

209
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:30,118
Yes. Pamela, you're not going to get
scared of this ghost business, are you?

210
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:33,372
Of course not, Rick. I don't
believe in them, really...

211
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:36,708
and I'd be interested,
not scared, wouldn't you?

212
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:41,189
Me? No, disturbances wouldn't disturb
me, not for a single second.

213
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:46,343
- It's Bobby!
- Of course it's Bobby.

214
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:49,118
Now don't go getting imaginative.

215
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:52,204
It is rather a filthy
room, isn't it?

216
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:55,936
We're here, Bobby.

217
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:58,688
He's trying to tell us about
the squirrel, I expect.

218
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:03,590
- Didn't he keep his date with you?
- Why don't you come up, stupid?

219
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:07,322
Rick, look at that
lamb of a window!

220
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:09,596
Never thought Bobby
was a killer at heart.

221
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:14,746
Who's that standing out there?

222
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:17,771
Looks like the old
boy's granddaughter.

223
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,713
Don't waste a wave on that one.

224
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:26,007
Because she didn't want
us to buy the house?

225
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:28,885
- I think she'd been crying.
- Had she?

226
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:30,220
Don't you see?

227
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:33,181
She adored the house,
and we've cast her out.

228
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:35,809
- Isn't it awful?
- Stop making up stories.

229
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:38,270
She didn't live here.
She just doesn't want us to.

230
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:40,772
She's an ill-mannered
little dog in the manger.

231
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:43,817
All right, Bobby. We'll
take you back to the inn...

232
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:45,777
and let you order your dinner.

233
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,176
Have you forgotten something?

234
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:58,313
No. On second thought, my landing
gear isn't what it used to be.

235
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,326
- Morning, sir.
- Morning.

236
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:36,896
- Twenty Turrets, please.
- Yes, sir.

237
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:42,292
- Isn't this Windward House?
- Yes, sir. Fine house too.

238
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:44,586
Glad to hear there'll
be folk in it again.

239
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:48,157
- You have a dozen of these?
- Likely I have.

240
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:51,801
Oh, maybe you're the new owner.

241
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:53,970
Yes, my sister and I bought
the place yesterday.

242
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:57,766
Well, well. I hope you'll bring
it back to itself again.

243
00:16:57,767 --> 00:17:00,769
The last lot that lived
there weren't no good.

244
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:03,063
Went away owing money.

245
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:06,441
Got out of their lease starting
ugly stories about the place.

246
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:09,569
- So that's how the rumors started.
- That's what I do say.

247
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:12,948
Here you are, sir. Nine
seems to be all I have.

248
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:15,909
- That's all right.
- Of course, there are others say different.

249
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:18,411
- There are?
- Well, that's only natural...

250
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:21,957
after the way the lady of
Windward House died...

251
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:25,085
- God rest her soul.
- You mean the commander's daughter?

252
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:28,630
Only child. Come near breaking
the old gentleman's heart.

253
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:31,424
- He's never been the same since.
- How did she die?

254
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:33,885
- Fell off the cliff.
- Accident?

255
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,346
That's what I do say.

256
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:38,431
Good morning, Mr. Hardy.

257
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:41,851
- A copy of Amateur Gardening, please.
- Yes, Mrs. Coatesworthy.

258
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:43,812
Well, the best of luck to you, sir.

259
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:46,773
If you have a favorite tobacco,
I'll be glad to stock it.

260
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,692
Thank you. Good-bye.

261
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:51,236
The gent that just
bought Windward House.

262
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,135
You don't say.

263
00:17:57,535 --> 00:17:59,995
- Mr. Fitzgerald?
- Yes?

264
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:02,872
- Oh, it's you.
- May I speak to you for a moment?

265
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:04,624
Look here, young lady...

266
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:07,836
if you want to talk me out of
Windward House, save your breath.

267
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:10,922
It isn't that. It's about
me, yesterday afternoon.

268
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,966
My behavior was inexcusable.

269
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:16,553
- Come now. It wasn't as bad as all that.
- Thank you very much.

270
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:18,555
Your grandfather made you
apologize, didn't he?

271
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:20,932
Oh, no. It was my mother.

272
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,684
Your moth...

273
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:25,312
But I understood that...
I beg your pardon?

274
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:28,773
I kept looking at her last night,
thinking how I'd let her down.

275
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,693
- But isn't your mother dead?
- Yes, but I know all about her.

276
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:35,280
From Grandfather, of course.
I was only three when she died.

277
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:36,990
But I thought you said
you looked at her.

278
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:39,993
Her portrait hangs in my room.
My father painted it.

279
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:44,998
- Oh, then it was his studio.
- Yes, and she was so beautiful.

280
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:47,318
Let's go for a walk.

281
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,464
Grandfather will never
get over her death.

282
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:55,717
- He's hated Windward ever since.
- That's understandable.

283
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:59,846
But it isn't fair to hate a house
because someone's died there.

284
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:03,183
I love Windward because she
lived there for three years...

285
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:04,643
and those were my years.

286
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:07,646
And that's why you don't want
anyone else to live in it?

287
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:10,940
- That's foolish, isn't it?
- No, just one thing is foolish:

288
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:13,610
You're living somebody else's life.

289
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:16,404
- How old are you, Stella Meredith?
- Twenty.

290
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,490
You're 20, and you're pretty.

291
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:22,452
You shouldn't be wasting a single second
looking back on three little years.

292
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:24,204
- You should be having fun.
- I am.

293
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:27,040
Oh, nonsense! What are you
doing today, for instance?

294
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:30,752
- Oh, just things.
- Facts, details.

295
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:34,673
Oh, dear. I've got
to match some wool.

296
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:38,176
Then I have to stop at the library
and get a copy of Bleak House.

297
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,928
Grandfather and I are
reading Dickens.

298
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:44,330
You're not going to do any of those
things. I have a much better idea.

299
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:56,111
Isn't this better than
reading to Grandfather?

300
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:59,887
- Oh, it's wonderful.
- Ever get seasick?

301
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:03,785
Fortunately, I have a
stomach like Gibraltar.

302
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:06,105
Not externally, of course.

303
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:10,250
- Are you asleep?
- No.

304
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:14,697
Just wondering if our national
confidence in Gibraltar isn't misplaced.

305
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,681
Shouldn't you get out of the sun?

306
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:26,641
No, I'd...

307
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,685
I'd rather...

308
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:30,687
remain here.

309
00:20:30,688 --> 00:20:33,962
Oh, please! The tiller... please!

310
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:44,325
- Smells good.
- That's mimosa. It was my mo...

311
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:47,245
Oh, I forgot. I'm not
supposed to talk about that.

312
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,664
- Why?
- Out of the past.

313
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:53,376
- Oh, go ahead.
- It was my mother's favorite perfume.

314
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:56,087
My father sent me a
bottle before he died.

315
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,907
I've made it last a long time.

316
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:02,635
Mimosa. Ever see it growing?

317
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:05,388
- No, I haven't.
- Like a million little yellow bells.

318
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:10,040
Like... Like sleigh bells.

319
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,818
It's smooth again.
Are you feeling better?

320
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:22,530
Oh, yes. I was about
to resume command.

321
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:25,283
Bring her about sharply.
Head straight for the jetty.

322
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:28,103
Avast the boom.
Scuttle the funnels.

323
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:31,891
Lady, please!

324
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:41,508
I thought you'd gone off
for London, Mr. Fitzgerald.

325
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:44,954
- Just leaving now, Ben.
- That'd be half a crown.

326
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:50,099
- You doing up your hair again?
- Yes.

327
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,669
No, no, no! Come on.

328
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:58,775
It's wonderful like this, all
loose and free and windblown.

329
00:21:58,776 --> 00:22:01,694
What am I doing? Talking high poetry
or selling hairstyle advertising?

330
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:03,905
- You laugh at everything, don't you?
- Too much?

331
00:22:03,906 --> 00:22:07,977
No. It's just I've never known
anyone who laughed much.

332
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:11,621
See a lot of Pamela while
I'm away, will you?

333
00:22:11,622 --> 00:22:14,582
- How long will you be gone?
- About three weeks.

334
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:17,418
Perhaps she'll let me help her
with the curtains and things.

335
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:20,880
Get her to talk about me.
In a respectful way, of course.

336
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:24,485
None of those anecdotes where
I'm the family half-wit.

337
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:28,137
I hope you have a nice trip.

338
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:30,598
- I'll take you home first.
- You're so late starring.

339
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:31,891
Might as well.

340
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:36,312
I'd rather break it gently to Grandfather
about our sail, if you don't mind.

341
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:39,482
All right. Gently but firmly, mind.

342
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:41,426
- Good-bye.
- Bye.

343
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:43,903
- Oh, Mr. Fitzgerald...
- Yes?

344
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:45,780
I almost forgot to say it.

345
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:49,117
I'm awfully happy you and your sister
are going to live at Windward.

346
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:51,846
Why, thank you, Stella Meredith!

347
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:15,143
Well, here we are.

348
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:19,230
What a grand house, Master Rick.
'Tis a mansion, so 'tis.

349
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:23,151
Are you worthy of it, Lizzie Flynn?
That's what I keep asking myself.

350
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:25,236
'Tis on top of the world.

351
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:26,487
- Rick!
- Hello, Pam.

352
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:28,590
- Baby darling!
- Lizzie!

353
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:32,744
Oh, you devil for being late.

354
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:35,121
I wanted you to see everything
while it was still daylight.

355
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:38,249
Ah, Master Rick and his
friends and their cocktails.

356
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,335
- Got Lizzie drunk.
- Get on with you, Master Rick.

357
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:43,588
- Oh, Bobby!
- Where's our Bobby?

358
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:46,049
- Don't, Rick.
- Something happen to him?

359
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:49,010
Nothing tragic. He
just wandered away.

360
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:50,887
I suppose I haven't
enough dog appeal.

361
00:23:50,888 --> 00:23:54,015
- No, seriously, Pam.
- He loathed the country.

362
00:23:54,016 --> 00:23:58,311
You know, no nice dustbins and no
sporting interest in finding a tree.

363
00:23:58,312 --> 00:24:01,757
Never heard of a
terrier walking out.

364
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:08,905
Ah, Miss Pamela, I'm
dreaming on me feet.

365
00:24:08,906 --> 00:24:11,741
Pam, it's perfect. You're
practically straight.

366
00:24:11,742 --> 00:24:14,619
There's some soup in the kitchen.

367
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:17,538
Look at Whiskey now.
He knows where the food is.

368
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:19,791
- How did the furniture fit in?
- Beautifully.

369
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:22,251
I saw the grandfather clock.
It waved both hands at me.

370
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:24,420
If the soup's burned,
Lizzie will spank me.

371
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:26,798
Get along with you, miss.

372
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,926
The saints be praised!
There's me old rocker.

373
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:33,657
It's been 10 years since you
nestled your bustle in that.

374
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:39,454
- You've done wonders, Pam.
- Thanks.

375
00:24:41,939 --> 00:24:45,358
Tell me, what does Stella
think of the changes?

376
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:46,818
You mean Stella Meredith?

377
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:48,987
- I haven't set eyes on her.
- You haven't?

378
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:52,782
I did write and ask her to tea.
Got a reply from the commander...

379
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:54,993
saying she wasn't strong
enough to accept invitations.

380
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:56,369
Not strong enough?

381
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:59,247
I expect it's us. We just
aren't nice to know.

382
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:02,625
But Stella was crazy to make
friends with you. She told me.

383
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:04,694
But where did you see her?

384
00:25:05,546 --> 00:25:08,756
Oh, uh, just before
I left for London.

385
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:11,092
Why, you colossal bluff!

386
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:13,886
You were just as sorry
for that child as I was.

387
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:18,516
Stop pushing her into the nursery.
She's 20. She said so herself.

388
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,494
You like her.

389
00:25:22,813 --> 00:25:24,836
I can't help it.

390
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:30,820
There's kind of a sleeping-beauty
magic about the kid.

391
00:25:30,821 --> 00:25:34,365
I'd thought I'd done something
toward breaking the spell.

392
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,409
Seems not.

393
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:38,703
Prince Charmless, that's me.

394
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:40,705
That'll do for
tonight, Mr. Roderick.

395
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:44,709
It's time for Miss Pamela to
go to bed. She looks tired out.

396
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:47,170
You're an old tyrant, Lizzie Flynn.

397
00:25:47,171 --> 00:25:49,444
But you're perfectly right.

398
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:55,154
Put the lights out, Rick.

399
00:25:57,014 --> 00:26:01,711
Now let's see. I think I turn it
down and blow down the chimney.

400
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:05,897
Haven't done that
since I was a kid.

401
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:08,342
Come now, Whiskey. Good boy.

402
00:26:09,443 --> 00:26:12,695
- Are you having him in your room?
- He's used to it, the creature.

403
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:14,890
Get along up, now.

404
00:26:15,449 --> 00:26:18,534
Haven't I carried you
enough this day?

405
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:21,809
- Get on up, now.
- I'll give him a start.

406
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:25,917
What in the name of all the saints?

407
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:29,879
Well, he's not used to
traveling and strange houses.

408
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,256
He'll find me if he wants me.

409
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:35,718
I've not slept with the sound of
the sea since I left Ireland.

410
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:37,678
Would you like to go back there?

411
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:41,875
- I'd sooner see meself dead.
- Ah, go on with yez.

412
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:47,230
Why, whatever ails these candles?

413
00:26:47,231 --> 00:26:49,816
It seems to be a rather
drafty staircase.

414
00:26:49,817 --> 00:26:52,610
Rick, I've had a swim every
day from our own beach...

415
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:54,362
and I've started to make a garden.

416
00:26:54,363 --> 00:26:56,864
You learn the oddest
things when you garden.

417
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:58,991
Did you know there's an
upside-down to seeds?

418
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:01,869
- No. Good night, Pam.
- Good night, Rick.

419
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:04,974
- Good night, Master Rick.
- Good night, Liz.

420
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:13,657
Come in.

421
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:19,137
I thought you were asleep.

422
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:22,242
It turns cold in the
night here sometimes.

423
00:27:24,226 --> 00:27:26,078
Oh, thanks.

424
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:30,982
Rick, there's something I
want to talk to you about.

425
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:34,527
Do you have any nice cast iron
I can swap for this mattress?

426
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:38,929
- We'll give you another tomorrow.
- Nothing will keep me awake tonight.

427
00:27:39,867 --> 00:27:42,702
What price our house,
Pam? Pretty good, hmm?

428
00:27:42,703 --> 00:27:46,747
- You're really pleased with it?
- I was never so happy in my life.

429
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:49,167
Oh, you starred to say
something. What?

430
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:52,670
It was just that I was the one
that got you to buy the house...

431
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:55,965
And I didn't appear very
appreciative. Is that it?

432
00:27:55,966 --> 00:27:57,508
It'll wait until tomorrow.

433
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:00,261
Bless you, Rick. Sleep well.

434
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:02,160
You too.

435
00:28:02,723 --> 00:28:05,167
These are pretty good apples.

436
00:28:07,895 --> 00:28:11,022
That concludes our
broadcast for today.

437
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:14,002
Good night, everyone. Good night.

438
00:28:52,773 --> 00:28:54,796
Pam, is that you?

439
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:13,870
- Rick.
- Pamela.

440
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:17,565
- We don't want to wake Lizzie.
- But isn't it Lizzie?

441
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:20,260
No, it isn't Lizzie.

442
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:22,820
It's coming from downstairs.

443
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:25,573
It comes from
everywhere and nowhere.

444
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:29,035
Take hold of yourself, Pam. I'm
going down and search the place.

445
00:30:29,036 --> 00:30:31,746
Rick, I've searched.

446
00:30:31,747 --> 00:30:35,958
- There's never anything there.
- "Never"? You mean you've heard it before?

447
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,835
YES.

448
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:40,880
Rick, it's true, isn't it? The sound,
I mean. You're hearing it too?

449
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:43,090
- Of course I'm hearing it.
- I wasn't sure.

450
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:46,177
- Pam...
- I thought I might be going crazy.

451
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:49,555
- Was that why you didn't tell me?
- Yes, that, and...

452
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:53,331
Rick, it's your home. It's
all we've got to live in.

453
00:30:56,104 --> 00:31:00,149
- It sounds so heartbroken.
- Now don't get rattled, Pam.

454
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:02,401
- There's a logical explanation for this.
- Such as?

455
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:06,598
You can't expect me to give it to you
offhand, but it stands to reason.

456
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:10,993
- Does it come every night?
- No.

457
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:14,955
Just when you begin to think
you dreamt it, it comes again.

458
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:17,605
Be calm, Pam. Be calm.

459
00:31:18,085 --> 00:31:20,252
I'm all right.

460
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:22,421
It'll stop soon now.

461
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:24,256
How do you know?

462
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:26,405
It dies away at dawn.

463
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:29,071
Listen.

464
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:36,411
That's the dawn breeze.

465
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:41,857
- Well, that's all for tonight.
- It's a pity, really.

466
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:44,693
Hardly gives one time to look
into it. Now listen, dear.

467
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:49,490
Look, let's talk tomorrow.
I'll die if I don't get some sleep.

468
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:51,992
Pam, leave your door open
in case you're nervous.

469
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:53,869
All right, Rick.

470
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,871
And remember, you haven't
a thing to worry about.

471
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:58,207
This business can be
scientifically explained.

472
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:01,210
Probably a loose wire hidden around
the house, acting as an aerial...

473
00:32:01,211 --> 00:32:03,712
picking up the sound of some
woman in the village crying.

474
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:07,425
Was she crying when the last
tenants were frightened out?

475
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:10,279
Well, maybe she had a sad life.

476
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:13,264
Anyway...

477
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:16,767
I'm here now, and I'm
not the least rattled.

478
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:19,667
Not the least little
bit in the world.

479
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:24,843
It's just silly to be upset.

480
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:42,293
Last night I heard it
myself, Commander Beech.

481
00:32:42,294 --> 00:32:45,754
A perfectly appalling
sound of crying.

482
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:48,382
Mr. Fitzgerald, Windward
House belongs to you now.

483
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:51,635
- Why do you bring this matter to me?
- Because we want information.

484
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:54,847
I for practical reasons, and my sister
because she believes it's a ghost.

485
00:32:54,848 --> 00:32:58,350
- She'd like to know what the ghost wants.
- What utter bosh!

486
00:32:58,351 --> 00:33:02,104
Bosh, I agree, but when
did the noises start?

487
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:05,024
- You inherited the house, I believe.
- From my grandmother.

488
00:33:05,025 --> 00:33:07,193
And there were no disturbances
there in her time?

489
00:33:07,194 --> 00:33:10,821
None. And if there are noises now,
they're from perfectly natural causes.

490
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:13,157
An echo from a subterranean
cave, perhaps.

491
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:15,117
That would've been heard
in your grandmother's day.

492
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:17,536
Erosion may have changed the
structure of the cliffs.

493
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:20,915
- It's not' a bad suggestion.
- May I come in, Grandfather?

494
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:24,126
No, you run along to church.
I'll join you in a few minutes.

495
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:27,505
- But I want to see Mr. Fitzgerald.
- I'm glad you're better.

496
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:31,008
"Better"? But I haven't been ill.

497
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:33,260
Stella merely suffers
with a general delicacy.

498
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:36,096
- She doesn't accept invitations.
- Never?

499
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:39,475
Perhaps I'd better frankly state she's
not strong enough to make new friends.

500
00:33:39,476 --> 00:33:41,310
- Grandfather!
- Run along, my dear.

501
00:33:41,311 --> 00:33:44,085
We're discussing
something privately.

502
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:49,568
Is there anything
else, Mr. Fitzgerald?

503
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:53,405
Just one more question. Was Stella's
mother ever troubled at Windward House?

504
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:55,991
- What do you mean?
- Did she hear the crying?

505
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:58,953
My daughter was not one to
circulate ridiculous rumors.

506
00:33:58,954 --> 00:34:01,747
If she'd heard this, she'd have
mentioned it, and she never did?

507
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:03,123
Certainly not.

508
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:04,959
Then the trouble must have
begun since her death.

509
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,254
- Do you mean to imply...
- No, I'm merely trying to set the date.

510
00:34:08,255 --> 00:34:11,966
- I didn't mean that your daughter haunts
- How dare you suggest such a thing?

511
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:15,553
Really, I'm most desperately
sorry. Please forgive me.

512
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:19,348
Very well. I accept your apology.
But please understand one thing.

513
00:34:19,349 --> 00:34:24,171
Your purchase of the property doesn't
establish a social bond between us.

514
00:34:24,688 --> 00:34:27,982
What's the matter with us? Why
don't you allow Stella to see us?

515
00:34:27,983 --> 00:34:29,733
Because I don't want to.

516
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:32,653
And I must ask for your word not
to send her any more invitations.

517
00:34:32,654 --> 00:34:34,446
I'll give you no such undertaking.

518
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:37,032
Very well. I shall know how
to deal with the matter.

519
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:40,119
Stella is not going
inside that house!

520
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:44,441
Great Scott! You believe
the place is haunted.

521
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:58,659
I hoped you'd come along.
I wanted to talk to you.

522
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:02,584
- Quick, drive around the next corner.
- Get in.

523
00:35:06,563 --> 00:35:09,189
You had four freckles on
the boat. They've gone.

524
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:12,760
I couldn't go to see your sister.
Grandfather's been ill.

525
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,513
Turn here.

526
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:23,996
Now, what is this about
your not seeing Pamela?

527
00:35:23,997 --> 00:35:27,708
At the mention of me coming to Windward,
Grandfather almost had an attack.

528
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:29,501
You feel your mother
never would've left him?

529
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:30,836
No, never.

530
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:33,839
Yet she did when she married, and
he seemed to survive very nicely.

531
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,174
He was younger then.

532
00:35:35,175 --> 00:35:38,135
Oh, so you're going to turn into
one of these dim little ladies...

533
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:40,596
who fill hot-water bottles
for elderly relatives.

534
00:35:40,597 --> 00:35:44,016
- Good-bye, Stella Meredith.
- I'm not now.

535
00:35:44,017 --> 00:35:45,809
You're here now.

536
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:49,355
That's practically the nicest
sentence that ever was spoken.

537
00:35:49,356 --> 00:35:51,815
Would you and your sister be in
if I came to Windward tonight?

538
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:53,275
Yes.

539
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:56,846
Supper's at 8:00, but please
come as early as you can.

540
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:01,639
Bob down. He's passing
the end of the lane.

541
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,393
He's gone.

542
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:07,790
How will I ever get to church?

543
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:11,270
Sit on the floor, and
I'll drive you past him.

544
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:18,238
- Drive to the side gate, please.
- Yes.

545
00:36:31,231 --> 00:36:34,460
- Like a lift, Commander?
- No, thank you.

546
00:36:39,072 --> 00:36:41,115
Oh! What a moment!

547
00:36:41,116 --> 00:36:45,346
- Were you scared?
- Yes, but it was wonderful.

548
00:36:57,632 --> 00:37:00,702
Well, good-bye. Say a
little prayer for me.

549
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:05,824
Golly! How am I ever going to
feel meek enough for church?

550
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:08,501
Oh, Stella.

551
00:37:08,977 --> 00:37:10,894
Here's your prayer book and purse.

552
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:13,373
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

553
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:39,214
Thank you, Mrs. Carlton, Colonel.

554
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:40,924
- Until next Sunday.
- Yes.

555
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:43,153
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

556
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:47,039
You seem very silent, Stella.

557
00:37:47,474 --> 00:37:50,350
What have you against the
Fitzgeralds, Grandfather?

558
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:52,920
Well, they're hardly our sort.

559
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,440
I've decided to make
friends with them.

560
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:58,543
You'll do no such thing.

561
00:38:01,154 --> 00:38:02,863
Why do you say that, Grandfather?

562
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:06,033
I do not consider it suitable for
you to visit Windward House.

563
00:38:06,034 --> 00:38:09,286
- Not suitable?
- I can't discuss the matter.

564
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:12,956
- That's all the reason I'm going to get?
- It will have to suffice, yes.

565
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:16,794
No, Grandfather. I'm 20, and I'm...

566
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:19,505
and it's time I stopped
living somebody else's life.

567
00:38:19,506 --> 00:38:23,425
- I shall go to Windward whenever I please.
- Did you hear what I said?

568
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:26,678
It isn't any good,
Grandfather. I'm on strike.

569
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:29,139
Stella, go to your room.

570
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:32,017
No use trying to lock me in.
There isn't any key.

571
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:34,462
Now don't be impertinent.

572
00:38:37,232 --> 00:38:39,900
- Hello, Annie.
- Dinner will be late, miss.

573
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:42,236
I'm having ever such
trouble with the lamb.

574
00:38:42,237 --> 00:38:44,715
You'd better tell the commander.

575
00:38:49,244 --> 00:38:53,038
Yes, it's very urgent. Will
you try to hurry the call?

576
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:56,166
Thank you. I'm telephoning.
Close that door.

577
00:38:56,167 --> 00:39:00,295
It's just that dinner will be late,
sir. It's the lamb being awkward.

578
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:04,800
I won't be here for dinner.
And take some to Stella on a tray.

579
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:07,074
And close that door!

580
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:13,868
May I speak to Miss Holloway?

581
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:22,150
It's a trunk call, Miss Holloway.
A Commander Beech.

582
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:24,003
Thank you.

583
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,407
Yes, Commander Beech?

584
00:39:28,408 --> 00:39:31,952
I want to consult you about
Stella, Miss Holloway.

585
00:39:31,953 --> 00:39:36,206
It's a matter of the utmost urgency.
I can be with you late this afternoon.

586
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:40,878
I can't see you till this evening, but I
shall be glad to put you up for the night.

587
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:43,171
Isn't it a little late to
consult me about Stella?

588
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:46,758
Yes, I know that, but I
beg you to help me now.

589
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:50,220
You're the only human being in
the world to whom I can turn.

590
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:53,056
The only person who wouldn't
think me demented...

591
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:56,643
because I believe a house can
be filled with malignity.

592
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:59,964
Malignity directed
against a certain child.

593
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:03,692
The dining room isn't finished yet.

594
00:40:03,693 --> 00:40:06,695
How glad this house must
be to be lived in again.

595
00:40:06,696 --> 00:40:08,947
I must dash back to Lizzie.
We're fighting...

596
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:11,366
over how much sherry you
put in a tipsy pudding.

597
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:13,577
She wants to make it dead drunk.

598
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:16,580
- Do you like tipsy pudding?
- I think I like everything to eat.

599
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:19,541
Show her the rest of the
house before it's dark.

600
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:21,460
You've really never been
here since you were three?

601
00:40:21,461 --> 00:40:22,711
Not inside.

602
00:40:22,712 --> 00:40:26,256
But I walked here once when I was
ten and peered in at the windows.

603
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,258
There was a stupendous row...

604
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:31,178
and the next week I got packed
off to a school in Brussels.

605
00:40:31,179 --> 00:40:34,014
- Did your grandfather give you reasons?
- "Reasons"?

606
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:38,370
If I'd ever been reasoned with,
I might have been a better child.

607
00:40:39,062 --> 00:40:44,168
- My old nursery's through there, isn't it?
- I should think so. It had nursery wallpaper.

608
00:40:45,735 --> 00:40:49,009
How pretty your sister's made it!

609
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:56,578
What is it?

610
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:59,039
Something I'd forgotten.

611
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,083
When I was little...

612
00:41:01,084 --> 00:41:03,377
I used to have a dream
about this room.

613
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:05,170
You did?

614
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:08,090
I'd be lying here,
and it'd be dark...

615
00:41:08,091 --> 00:41:11,301
and cold and frightening.

616
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:15,472
And then... a little
flame would come.

617
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:18,809
Just a tiny point
of light so big...

618
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:21,979
and yet suddenly
everything would be...

619
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:25,459
warm and light and peaceful.

620
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:27,818
And then...

621
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:31,029
someone would come and put the
flame out, and I'd be terrified.

622
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:33,281
Perhaps your mother used
to bring you a night light.

623
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:35,601
But who'd take it out?

624
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:41,228
May I see the studio
before it's dark?

625
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:49,024
It's rather messy in here.
I was thinking of skipping this.

626
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:52,785
This is where my father
painted my mother's picture.

627
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:56,535
Strange to think of them here.

628
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:02,936
My father would have his easel
to the light, wouldn't he?

629
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:07,232
And perhaps my mother would sit
there in her soft, white dress.

630
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:09,651
But sometimes, of course,
he'd paint the other one.

631
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:11,945
- "The other one"?
- He had a model, you know.

632
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:13,822
A foreign girl.

633
00:42:13,823 --> 00:42:16,992
I've never been able to
find out much about her.

634
00:42:16,993 --> 00:42:20,203
People get awfully
hush-hush when I ask them.

635
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:22,372
Between you and me and
the grand piano...

636
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:25,333
I suspect Father was
a bit of a bad hat.

637
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:29,588
- Artistic temperament?
- Very artistic, I'm afraid.

638
00:42:29,589 --> 00:42:32,382
But sometimes, you know,
it's quite a comfort to me.

639
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:35,844
- In what way?
- If Father had been as good as Mother...

640
00:42:35,845 --> 00:42:39,056
think how good I'd have been.

641
00:42:39,057 --> 00:42:42,707
It's getting almost too
dark to see you properly.

642
00:42:51,861 --> 00:42:54,446
Won't you play something?

643
00:42:54,447 --> 00:42:57,141
It's about time you asked me that.

644
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:45,872
- Oh, please go on.
- Just a second.

645
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:48,500
- You made that up?
- Yes.

646
00:43:48,501 --> 00:43:50,877
- But you must be brilliant!
- Oh, dazzling.

647
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:54,172
- People have to wear sunglasses.
- What's it called?

648
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:58,218
It's a serenade.
"To Stella by Starlight."

649
00:43:58,219 --> 00:44:00,947
You mean, this Stella?

650
00:44:01,514 --> 00:44:04,724
But it's the most exciting thing
that's ever happened to me!

651
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:06,498
Is it?

652
00:44:06,936 --> 00:44:08,959
Please go on.

653
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:19,094
You see, this is the only
way I can paint you.

654
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:22,325
Some black keys and some white...

655
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:25,328
and fingers that are
much too clumsy...

656
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:27,682
but you're in it somehow.

657
00:44:44,015 --> 00:44:47,851
It's gone awfully sad.
Why have you changed it?

658
00:44:47,852 --> 00:44:50,205
It just came out that way.

659
00:45:02,617 --> 00:45:06,203
What's the matter? What is it,
Stella? You're trembling.

660
00:45:06,204 --> 00:45:10,290
I was wicked. How could I ever
have laughed in her house?

661
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:13,126
But it's my house
now, Pam's and mine.

662
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:16,948
But she was so young, and
she died so cruelly.

663
00:45:19,217 --> 00:45:20,990
Stella!

664
00:45:23,012 --> 00:45:24,830
Stella!

665
00:45:26,432 --> 00:45:29,285
- Rick, what is it?
- I don't know. It's that blasted room!

666
00:45:31,312 --> 00:45:33,255
Stella, stop!

667
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:39,177
Stella!

668
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:43,406
For heaven's sake, Stella!

669
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:45,867
- What's the matter, Rick?
- You were going over the edge.

670
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:48,536
- Was I?
- If I hadn't caught you.

671
00:45:48,537 --> 00:45:51,206
I hadn't any sense
of danger at all.

672
00:45:51,207 --> 00:45:52,791
Look.

673
00:45:52,792 --> 00:45:57,147
I think this is where my mother
fell. By the dead tree.

674
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:00,674
Are you all right?

675
00:46:00,675 --> 00:46:03,635
Quite, thanks, except
dying of hunger.

676
00:46:03,636 --> 00:46:07,013
Then you must come
and get some food.

677
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:09,724
Do you know this is our very
first party in this house?

678
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:11,643
- Is it?
- Shall we sing her the song?

679
00:46:11,644 --> 00:46:13,838
His introduction to music.

680
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:28,761
Stay here.

681
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:35,000
Lizzie, where are you?
What's the matter?

682
00:46:35,001 --> 00:46:38,230
Mr. Roderick! Mr. Roderick!

683
00:46:43,426 --> 00:46:47,846
- What is it, Lizzie? Are you hurt?
- The studio door...

684
00:46:47,847 --> 00:46:50,473
there's something there.

685
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:52,934
Look, Lizzie, there's
nothing there.

686
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:56,563
There was! I saw it
with me own two eyes!

687
00:46:56,564 --> 00:46:58,231
What?

688
00:46:58,232 --> 00:47:01,818
It was like a mist...
a crawling mist.

689
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:04,237
You imagined it just because you
heard the house was haunted.

690
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:07,115
I'd heard nothing of the
sort, Mr. Roderick.

691
00:47:07,116 --> 00:47:10,410
Holy saints! Are you
tellin' me it is?

692
00:47:10,411 --> 00:47:12,454
For heaven's sake,
Rick, what is it?

693
00:47:12,455 --> 00:47:14,873
Oh, Lizzie's dreamed up
a ghost for herself.

694
00:47:14,874 --> 00:47:17,042
Come along, Lizzie.

695
00:47:17,043 --> 00:47:19,002
Oh, darling Lizzie.

696
00:47:19,003 --> 00:47:21,546
I'd just come upstairs
to turn down the beds.

697
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:24,549
There it stood by the studio
door, looking down at me.

698
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:28,470
- A woman, it was.
- Four steps back, it was just a mist.

699
00:47:28,471 --> 00:47:30,430
'Twas a woman. I swear it.

700
00:47:30,431 --> 00:47:32,932
The ghost of a woman!

701
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:36,378
Come and sit down. You'll
be all right in a minute.

702
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:46,446
- Have some sherry, Lizzie.
- Just a drop.

703
00:47:46,447 --> 00:47:48,907
I'll not sleep in this house
another night, Mr. Roderick.

704
00:47:48,908 --> 00:47:51,951
- Come now, Lizzie.
- I will not! I'd sooner die.

705
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:54,829
She can go to the Jessup farm.

706
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:57,024
What's happened to Stella?

707
00:47:58,793 --> 00:48:01,753
She was with me when I came in.

708
00:48:01,754 --> 00:48:03,606
Stella?

709
00:48:07,927 --> 00:48:10,029
Stella, where are you?

710
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:14,583
Stella, are you in the house?

711
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:21,044
Stella!

712
00:48:24,235 --> 00:48:26,713
Pamela! Pamela!

713
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:32,934
Stella, darling.

714
00:48:34,412 --> 00:48:36,810
Yes, Rick? What's happened?

715
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:40,333
- Rick, what is it?
- She's in a dead faint.

716
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:43,438
- This room, it's like an icebox.
- Colder.

717
00:48:44,839 --> 00:48:46,047
We'll have to get a doctor.

718
00:48:46,048 --> 00:48:48,947
There's one at the first
house in the village.

719
00:48:50,428 --> 00:48:52,178
That's a girl.

720
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:55,265
Well, what kind of
bogey did you see?

721
00:48:55,266 --> 00:48:57,058
I didn't see anything.

722
00:48:57,059 --> 00:49:00,061
Fainted out of sheer
cussedness, huh?

723
00:49:00,062 --> 00:49:03,382
I can only remember
the cold coming.

724
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:05,967
Hello, Stella.

725
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:11,015
- Hello.
- You suddenly felt cold?

726
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:14,617
It wasn't just that.

727
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:19,414
- The room went cold, and I was frightened.
- Well, you just forget about it for a bit.

728
00:49:19,415 --> 00:49:24,362
Miss Fitzgerald's got some soup for you.
See if you can get her to take some.

729
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:38,099
She'll do all right, but it's
quite a nasty case of shock.

730
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:40,852
- That's all? You're quite sure?
- Sit down.

731
00:49:40,853 --> 00:49:43,456
You see, I brought her here.

732
00:49:44,315 --> 00:49:46,149
Take that neat.

733
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:48,651
Can, uh... Can she
stay the night here?

734
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:51,613
Oh, yes. But suppose that
spook starts howling?

735
00:49:51,614 --> 00:49:52,739
Oh, your spook.

736
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:56,075
It's just an echo from a cave
probably, but it sounds like a spook.

737
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:58,786
I'd rather risk it
than move her tonight.

738
00:49:58,787 --> 00:50:01,581
There was some rather queer
business earlier this evening.

739
00:50:01,582 --> 00:50:04,626
The cliff is so close, and she walked right
to the edge. If I hadn't caught her...

740
00:50:04,627 --> 00:50:07,230
We'll keep a close watch.

741
00:50:07,713 --> 00:50:11,174
- Did she take her soup?
- Eight spoonfuls, then drifted off to sleep.

742
00:50:11,175 --> 00:50:13,468
Splendid. She'll
sleep for hours now.

743
00:50:13,469 --> 00:50:17,013
- We'll keep on watch here.
- You'd better go to bed, Miss Fitzgerald.

744
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:20,266
- You're looking all in.
- I'd rather watch with you.

745
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:22,602
- Would you like some coffee?
- Thanks.

746
00:50:22,603 --> 00:50:26,272
Pam, who do you think's
moved in with Dr. Scott?

747
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:28,066
- Our Bobby.
- No!

748
00:50:28,067 --> 00:50:32,070
I found the poor dog in the street.
He was in a pitiable state of nerves.

749
00:50:32,071 --> 00:50:33,738
- How is he now?
- Fine.

750
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:37,283
- Bobby was the first to see the ghost.
- See? Pamela believes it.

751
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:41,788
Rick, stop hiding your head in the sand.
You heard the sounds last night.

752
00:50:41,789 --> 00:50:43,915
Lizzie's been half frightened
out of her wits...

753
00:50:43,916 --> 00:50:46,334
and Stella's been in
deadly danger twice.

754
00:50:46,335 --> 00:50:48,836
Everyone in the village
knows the house is strange.

755
00:50:48,837 --> 00:50:50,672
I expected support from you.

756
00:50:50,673 --> 00:50:54,467
You must tell us everything you know about
the place after I've made the coffee.

757
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:56,636
Unfortunately I'm a
newcomer to Biddlecombe.

758
00:50:56,637 --> 00:50:59,786
I've only lived here 12 years.

759
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:05,186
It's not ancient history
to us. Please go on.

760
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:06,771
The model's name was Carmel.

761
00:51:06,772 --> 00:51:09,607
She was a Spanish gypsy,
and a thorough bad lot.

762
00:51:09,608 --> 00:51:11,526
So was Meredith, from
what I can gather.

763
00:51:11,527 --> 00:51:15,280
- Didn't Mrs. Meredith suspect? - She
must have. The thing was an open scandal.

764
00:51:15,281 --> 00:51:18,533
The girl and he'd have been stoned out
of the village if not for Mary Meredith.

765
00:51:18,534 --> 00:51:22,912
She was very much admired. I suppose
she just accepted the situation.

766
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:25,290
And she's still sobbing
her hear: out about it.

767
00:51:25,291 --> 00:51:28,418
- Where's Carmel now?
- Dead. She died in this very house...

768
00:51:28,419 --> 00:51:32,547
a week after Mary fell from the cliff trying
to save her from suicide. Ironic, wasn't it?

769
00:51:32,548 --> 00:51:36,467
- Is it known why the girl tried to kill herself?
- Meredith's said to have tired of her.

770
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:40,847
Think of it... those two women
struggling on the cliff.

771
00:51:40,848 --> 00:51:42,974
I wonder if Mary's death
could have been murder.

772
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:44,726
It's been hinted at.

773
00:51:44,727 --> 00:51:48,479
The whole story was dug up and
embroidered when Stella's father died.

774
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,523
- When was that?
- Three years ago, abroad.

775
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:54,444
- He never came back to Windward.
- All of them dead with their secrets.

776
00:51:54,445 --> 00:51:57,280
One of them's not quite
dead enough for me.

777
00:51:57,281 --> 00:51:59,991
Don't say that about the poor soul.

778
00:51:59,992 --> 00:52:03,620
If a spirit comes back, it's
for some particular purpose.

779
00:52:03,621 --> 00:52:07,332
- That's my sister's special crotchet.
- We've got to find out what it is.

780
00:52:07,333 --> 00:52:11,252
I wish I knew some more,
but I'm afraid I don't.

781
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:14,756
- What time's your wailing lady due?
- About dawn.

782
00:52:14,757 --> 00:52:18,612
We ought to know each other
pretty well by then.

783
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:23,389
Twenty-one hand. I'm out.

784
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:26,851
- Is it my deal?
- It was, two hours ago.

785
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:29,479
5:30.

786
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:33,084
Yes, Moaning Martha seems
to have missed her cue.

787
00:52:34,485 --> 00:52:37,320
Rick, have you brought
some more flowers in?

788
00:52:37,321 --> 00:52:39,030
No. Why?

789
00:52:39,031 --> 00:52:42,116
Don't you notice the scent?
It's overpowering.

790
00:52:42,117 --> 00:52:44,311
Extraordinary.

791
00:52:44,745 --> 00:52:47,121
Heliotrope, isn't it?

792
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:49,040
No.

793
00:52:49,041 --> 00:52:51,109
No, it's mimosa.

794
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:56,506
- There's a light!
- Where did that come from?

795
00:52:56,507 --> 00:52:58,951
It's like a night-light.

796
00:53:06,934 --> 00:53:08,911
She's gone!

797
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:11,546
Rick, the window!

798
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:15,926
- What is it?
- Where are you, Stella?

799
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:28,351
Don't be afraid, Stella.

800
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:33,251
- "Afraid"?
- Well, we were, a little.

801
00:53:33,252 --> 00:53:35,920
I wanted to see the dawn with her.

802
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:37,694
"Her"?

803
00:53:38,424 --> 00:53:40,883
Don't you know who
it is in your house?

804
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:43,828
- It's my mother.
- You saw her?

805
00:53:44,263 --> 00:53:46,764
I didn't see her...

806
00:53:46,765 --> 00:53:49,767
but when I woke, she
was here in the room.

807
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:54,749
It was full of her scent. I could
feel her presence everywhere.

808
00:53:55,983 --> 00:53:58,693
And there was something else...

809
00:53:58,694 --> 00:54:01,738
something I've never
known in my whole life.

810
00:54:01,739 --> 00:54:03,281
What?

811
00:54:03,282 --> 00:54:07,201
The knowledge that... someone
loved me very dearly.

812
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:10,621
Come on, young Stella.
I'll take you home.

813
00:54:10,622 --> 00:54:12,331
But I don't want to go.

814
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:14,834
Sorry, but I've got to get
some sleep, you know.

815
00:54:14,835 --> 00:54:18,004
- But I can come back?
- No.

816
00:54:18,005 --> 00:54:21,299
What do you mean? You couldn't
want to keep me away from her.

817
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:24,260
Stella, remember how ill
you were last night?

818
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:26,429
But that was nothing
to do with her.

819
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:29,223
I think I was just frightened
after what Lizzie said.

820
00:54:29,224 --> 00:54:31,684
I tell you, my mother
would never hurt me.

821
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:34,664
I shan't be afraid again. Please.

822
00:54:36,982 --> 00:54:41,027
I'm sorry. It's just that
my knees are wobbly.

823
00:54:41,028 --> 00:54:43,847
Come along. Dr. Scott
will drive you home.

824
00:54:58,754 --> 00:55:01,798
I wonder what I've done to
her, bringing her here.

825
00:55:01,799 --> 00:55:03,800
Don't blame yourself.

826
00:55:03,801 --> 00:55:07,701
But that look in her eyes,
that terrible happiness.

827
00:55:11,016 --> 00:55:14,018
Wait a minute. Perhaps she's
nearer right than we are.

828
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:17,355
- She's what?
- Perhaps she's right in being happy.

829
00:55:17,356 --> 00:55:21,359
Supposing Mary Meredith's spirit
had been searching for Stella...

830
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:24,964
and now that it's found
her, it's found peace.

831
00:55:25,656 --> 00:55:28,741
Suppose we haven't a ghost anymore.

832
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:31,160
- Where are you going?
- To the studio.

833
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:33,538
How has it always shown
itself in the past?

834
00:55:33,539 --> 00:55:37,625
Sobbing sounds downstairs, and
cold and depression in the studio.

835
00:55:37,626 --> 00:55:41,212
There wasn't any sobbing tonight,
only warmth and fragrance.

836
00:55:41,213 --> 00:55:43,840
- But why the studio?
- I'll know in there.

837
00:55:43,841 --> 00:55:47,366
I'll know whether it's a decent,
human room. Won't you?

838
00:55:52,516 --> 00:55:54,892
It may not be quite
so cold, really.

839
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:58,104
Oh, stop it, Pam.
It's clammy and rotten.

840
00:55:58,105 --> 00:56:00,982
Whatever it is, it's
in here with us.

841
00:56:00,983 --> 00:56:02,960
Let's get out.

842
00:56:18,458 --> 00:56:21,232
Mary Meredith, please.

843
00:56:22,004 --> 00:56:25,840
Please. We're sorry
you had to suffer.

844
00:56:25,841 --> 00:56:29,787
Isn't that enough?
What more do you want?

845
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:32,972
You were right about
one thing, Pam:

846
00:56:32,973 --> 00:56:36,043
We haven't a ghost anymore.
We've got two of them.

847
00:56:39,771 --> 00:56:43,190
- Is Commander Beech at home?
- He won't be back until this evening, sir.

848
00:56:43,191 --> 00:56:46,861
- It's Miss Stella I really want to see.
- Won't you come in? I'll tell her.

849
00:56:46,862 --> 00:56:48,714
Thank you.

850
00:56:52,951 --> 00:56:55,804
Miss Stella's in her
room, sir. I'll...

851
00:56:58,206 --> 00:57:00,666
- Rick.
- Stella.

852
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:03,210
- I knew you couldn't mean it.
- Mean what?

853
00:57:03,211 --> 00:57:05,588
Haven't you come to
take me to Windward?

854
00:57:05,589 --> 00:57:07,256
No, Stella.

855
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:09,951
You mustn't go there again, ever.

856
00:57:10,636 --> 00:57:12,595
Listen, darling...

857
00:57:12,596 --> 00:57:15,932
I've thought this thing out, and
you must go away from here.

858
00:57:15,933 --> 00:57:18,351
- Go away?
- Yes, forever.

859
00:57:18,352 --> 00:57:19,685
You wouldn't care?

860
00:57:19,686 --> 00:57:22,396
Not in the least, because
I'll be coming with you.

861
00:57:22,397 --> 00:57:26,108
It won't be luxury, just the smallest
London flat, but it'll be ours.

862
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:28,152
And no unseen, uninvited guests.

863
00:57:28,153 --> 00:57:30,571
- And Windward?
- We'll tear it down and forget it.

864
00:57:30,572 --> 00:57:32,156
And my mother?

865
00:57:32,157 --> 00:57:34,867
But Stella, you're talking
of a dream and a memory.

866
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:38,454
I'm talking about my mother.
She's been waiting for me.

867
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:41,958
In some queer sort of
way, I always knew it.

868
00:57:41,959 --> 00:57:45,461
What about me? I was under the
impression you cared for me.

869
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:47,755
This hasn't anything
to do with you.

870
00:57:47,756 --> 00:57:51,342
You talk about destroying that house.
You'd be tearing me apart.

871
00:57:51,343 --> 00:57:55,137
Stop it, Stella. Do you
care for me or don't you?

872
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:58,557
I can't think about you,
not while she's out there.

873
00:57:58,558 --> 00:57:59,767
Take me there.

874
00:57:59,768 --> 00:58:03,604
But this is horrible, unhealthy
stuff. Put it out of your mind.

875
00:58:03,605 --> 00:58:06,065
Turn your back on the
past and run, run hard.

876
00:58:06,066 --> 00:58:08,317
I'll go there somehow.

877
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:11,888
- You won't, I promise you.
- I hate you for that.

878
00:58:13,115 --> 00:58:14,808
Stella.

879
00:58:17,285 --> 00:58:20,685
You shan't make me
forget her! You shan't!

880
00:58:26,086 --> 00:58:28,004
That's enough, Bobby.
That's enough.

881
00:58:28,005 --> 00:58:30,131
You'll get lipstick poisoning.

882
00:58:30,132 --> 00:58:32,466
He's got a passion for
hard-boiled eggs. Did you know?

883
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:33,968
And turnip tops.

884
00:58:33,969 --> 00:58:36,929
I don't think he has any
idea he's a dog. Not really.

885
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:40,474
Of course, he thinks he has a
rather odd figure for a man.

886
00:58:40,475 --> 00:58:43,019
I didn't question him very
closely about where he belonged.

887
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:45,938
I was afraid I might find out.
I'm sorry now.

888
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:49,692
- Sorry?
- Yes. I should've met you sooner.

889
00:58:49,693 --> 00:58:52,546
- Are you there, Scott?
- In here.

890
00:58:54,281 --> 00:58:56,657
- Did you see Stella?
- Yes, I did.

891
00:58:56,658 --> 00:58:59,452
You've got to do something.
She's on the edge of a collapse.

892
00:58:59,453 --> 00:59:03,247
You're telling me? This is hardly a
case for a country doctor, you know.

893
00:59:03,248 --> 00:59:05,791
- When does the commander get back?
- Last train tonight.

894
00:59:05,792 --> 00:59:08,169
- Heaven help young Stella then.
- Look here.

895
00:59:08,170 --> 00:59:11,338
Can't you convince her her mother
wouldn't want her to go near that house?

896
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:15,384
Not I. She's been listening for a
voice that's been still for 17 years.

897
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:17,303
I can give her a sedative.

898
00:59:17,304 --> 00:59:20,264
Why don't we try to get a
message from Mary Meredith?

899
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:22,558
- Do what?
- We could hold a séance.

900
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:23,517
You're not serious?

901
00:59:23,518 --> 00:59:26,562
That's how the dead are supposed
to communicate with the living.

902
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:30,024
- According to the idiot fringe.
- You have no right to say that.

903
00:59:30,025 --> 00:59:32,860
Many intelligent people
believe in spiritualism.

904
00:59:32,861 --> 00:59:35,488
- Have you ever been to a séance?
- I have.

905
00:59:35,489 --> 00:59:38,866
Shaded lights, the alphabet laid out on
the table, an upside-down wine glass...

906
00:59:38,867 --> 00:59:42,620
messages from somebody's Uncle Oswald,
how to find a mislaid toothbrush. Oh!

907
00:59:42,621 --> 00:59:46,066
Stop scoffing, Rick.
Not all séances are faked.

908
00:59:47,751 --> 00:59:50,127
All right, we'll have a séance.

909
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:53,214
It shouldn't be difficult to move a glass
around and say it's Mary Meredith.

910
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:55,174
- What do you think?
- Leave me out of this.

911
00:59:55,175 --> 00:59:56,759
I won't let you cheat Stella.

912
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:59,136
What do you expect Mary
Meredith to tell her?

913
00:59:59,137 --> 01:00:01,972
"Entrust your life to a tall, dark
man, excruciatingly handsome"?

914
01:00:01,973 --> 01:00:05,851
Crikey, no! I want to set Stella's mind
at rest. She's just about torn in two.

915
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:09,438
Unless the conflict
inside her is stopped...

916
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:13,609
- it may even affect her reason.
- Here's a message that might do it:

917
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:17,363
"Stella, this is your mother. Since
I've found you, I've found peace.

918
01:00:17,364 --> 01:00:19,490
Stay away from Windward House."

919
01:00:19,491 --> 01:00:21,951
- Stella would have to be at the séance.
- Naturally.

920
01:00:21,952 --> 01:00:24,662
It'll have to be at Windward,
and it's dangerous for her.

921
01:00:24,663 --> 01:00:29,439
- We'd be with her all the time.
- All right. It may be worth a try.

922
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:41,887
The important thing is that
we should all believe.

923
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:45,808
- Isn't it, Dr. Scott?
- So I understand. What now?

924
01:00:45,809 --> 01:00:48,833
Everybody puts a
finger on the glass.

925
01:00:51,773 --> 01:00:54,877
Perhaps you should ask
some questions, Stella.

926
01:00:56,862 --> 01:00:58,964
Is anybody here?

927
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:14,153
Are you my mother?

928
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:23,826
You don't want me to stay away
from Windward, do you, Mother?

929
01:01:32,439 --> 01:01:36,192
Oh, I knew it, Mother.
And I want to be near you too.

930
01:01:36,193 --> 01:01:40,218
Is that why you stay here,
just to be near me?

931
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:47,703
But you're holding it, Rick.
And you, Dr. Scott. Holding it hard.

932
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:49,898
Take your fingers off.

933
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:56,400
Is that your reason, darling?
Just to be near me?

934
01:02:03,929 --> 01:02:05,827
But what else?

935
01:02:09,601 --> 01:02:11,248
I...

936
01:02:11,937 --> 01:02:13,664
G...

937
01:02:15,148 --> 01:02:17,524
U... A...

938
01:02:17,525 --> 01:02:19,318
"I guard."

939
01:02:19,319 --> 01:02:22,468
You mean, you guard
me from some danger?

940
01:02:25,784 --> 01:02:27,431
But what?

941
01:02:29,204 --> 01:02:30,726
C...

942
01:02:32,249 --> 01:02:33,851
A...

943
01:02:34,876 --> 01:02:36,523
R...

944
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:40,277
- M...
- "Carmel."

945
01:02:51,059 --> 01:02:52,851
- That's enough.
- It is indeed.

946
01:02:52,852 --> 01:02:55,250
Let's go into the other room.

947
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:59,858
- Stella, what is it?
- Are you ill, Stella?

948
01:02:59,859 --> 01:03:02,236
Quiet. Leave her alone.

949
01:03:02,237 --> 01:03:04,363
Oigan. ¡Oigan!

950
01:03:04,364 --> 01:03:06,907
- Stop her, Scott!
- She's in a trance.

951
01:03:06,908 --> 01:03:10,202
I saw this happen once before at a
séance. I thought it was a fake.

952
01:03:10,203 --> 01:03:13,247
- But this isn't.
- I know. It's dangerous.

953
01:03:13,248 --> 01:03:15,416
- May I ask her some questions?
- No!

954
01:03:15,417 --> 01:03:17,793
It may be best to try
and reach her mind.

955
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:20,943
Now keep your voice
quiet and reassuring.

956
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:24,967
Are you Mary Meredith,
Stella's mother?

957
01:03:24,968 --> 01:03:28,012
Ella no e'. Ella no e'!

958
01:03:28,013 --> 01:03:29,555
¡No le crean na'!

959
01:03:29,556 --> 01:03:32,016
¡No le pongan oido
que está mintiendo!

960
01:03:32,017 --> 01:03:34,290
Don't ask her any more!

961
01:03:36,104 --> 01:03:37,896
That's the doorbell.

962
01:03:37,897 --> 01:03:40,566
Shall I answer it?
Lizzie's at the Jessups'.

963
01:03:40,567 --> 01:03:43,319
No. Don't move until she's
over the worst of this.

964
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:46,572
¡So' ladrona!
!Ladrona de mi cariño!

965
01:03:46,573 --> 01:03:49,366
- Spanish, isn't it, Scott?
- I don't know.

966
01:03:49,367 --> 01:03:52,453
Rick, the mimosa scent!

967
01:03:52,454 --> 01:03:55,205
The room's full of it!

968
01:03:55,206 --> 01:03:57,729
Mary Meredith's in here too.

969
01:04:00,712 --> 01:04:02,530
The cold.

970
01:04:02,881 --> 01:04:05,257
It's never been cold in here.

971
01:04:05,258 --> 01:04:08,032
The candles! Look at the candles!

972
01:04:14,476 --> 01:04:17,500
- I'd better answer it.
- All right.

973
01:04:17,937 --> 01:04:20,105
Stop, Pamela!

974
01:04:20,106 --> 01:04:22,208
Don't go near that door.

975
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:36,188
It's coming toward us!

976
01:04:46,007 --> 01:04:48,467
What in thunder is this?

977
01:04:48,468 --> 01:04:52,054
- Stella dear, it's all right now.
- We must get her out.

978
01:04:52,055 --> 01:04:55,079
What have you been
doing to the child?

979
01:04:56,476 --> 01:04:59,603
- What's the meaning of this, Dr. Scott?
- I can't explain now.

980
01:04:59,604 --> 01:05:03,232
- This is incredible behavior!
- Quietly, Stella.

981
01:05:03,233 --> 01:05:06,026
- There's nothing to be frightened of.
- Control yourself, child!

982
01:05:06,027 --> 01:05:07,027
Don't speak to her like that!

983
01:05:07,028 --> 01:05:09,446
You're responsible for this.
You and your meddling.

984
01:05:09,447 --> 01:05:12,157
And so are you. Why didn't
you tell us the truth?

985
01:05:12,158 --> 01:05:14,535
- I warned you.
- Only of idle gossip.

986
01:05:14,536 --> 01:05:18,080
Perhaps you'd like your money back. You
shall have it, the entire purchase price.

987
01:05:18,081 --> 01:05:20,666
No, thank you, Commander.
I know this now:

988
01:05:20,667 --> 01:05:22,793
Stella will never be well
until this house is cured.

989
01:05:22,794 --> 01:05:24,253
Somehow we're going to cure it.

990
01:05:24,254 --> 01:05:28,109
Dr. Scott, have the
goodness to drive us home.

991
01:05:30,510 --> 01:05:33,238
There. Now you'll sleep all right.

992
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:38,767
I'll be here early in the morning.

993
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:41,145
Stella is no longer
your patient. Nor am I.

994
01:05:41,146 --> 01:05:45,843
- But someone must look after her.
- That is not your concern, Dr. Scott.

995
01:05:51,531 --> 01:05:55,386
- I shall be at your disposal at any hour.
- Thank you.

996
01:05:57,036 --> 01:05:59,810
Everything will be all right.

997
01:06:04,544 --> 01:06:07,113
Won't you come in, Miss Holloway?

998
01:06:10,216 --> 01:06:12,739
- Is she asleep?
- Not yet.

999
01:06:22,103 --> 01:06:23,830
Hello, Stella.

1000
01:06:24,689 --> 01:06:26,086
Miss Holloway.

1001
01:06:27,150 --> 01:06:28,797
Go to sleep, Stella.

1002
01:06:36,868 --> 01:06:39,661
Dr. Scott tells me she went
into a trance tonight.

1003
01:06:39,662 --> 01:06:41,830
Spoke some words they
thought were Spanish.

1004
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:43,790
How did she happen
to be at Windward?

1005
01:06:43,791 --> 01:06:46,752
The people who bought the place
are searching into its past.

1006
01:06:46,753 --> 01:06:49,755
- Are they indeed?
- Can you make the child well again?

1007
01:06:49,756 --> 01:06:51,215
I hope so.

1008
01:06:51,216 --> 01:06:54,927
It won't be a short process.
She's far more ill than you imagine.

1009
01:06:54,928 --> 01:06:58,639
She won't want to go with you.
She's never outgrown her fear of you.

1010
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:01,725
I could've cured it years ago
if you'd let me have her...

1011
01:07:01,726 --> 01:07:03,393
as Mary would have wished me to.

1012
01:07:03,394 --> 01:07:07,272
Her place was in Mary's home. I've
taught her to be like Mary in every way.

1013
01:07:07,273 --> 01:07:11,068
- How can you say such a thing?
- She's not so beautiful, of course.

1014
01:07:11,069 --> 01:07:13,070
Mary was a goddess.

1015
01:07:13,071 --> 01:07:16,471
Her skin was radiant,
and that bright, bright hair.

1016
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:20,644
How this room brings
her back to me.

1017
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:23,413
The nights we sat talking in
front of that fireplace...

1018
01:07:23,414 --> 01:07:25,582
planning our whole lives.

1019
01:07:25,583 --> 01:07:28,627
It wasn't flirtations and
dresses we talked about.

1020
01:07:28,628 --> 01:07:31,713
We were no silly, giggling girls.

1021
01:07:31,714 --> 01:07:35,801
- We intended to conquer life.
- You at least did.

1022
01:07:35,802 --> 01:07:38,512
Will you try to take
Mary's place with her now?

1023
01:07:38,513 --> 01:07:40,991
I'll do my best.

1024
01:07:41,975 --> 01:07:43,976
She's asleep.

1025
01:07:43,977 --> 01:07:46,812
If you'll call my chauffeur,
he'll carry her downstairs.

1026
01:07:46,813 --> 01:07:49,837
It will be better for her
to wake at my place.

1027
01:07:50,608 --> 01:07:53,006
I'm deeply grateful to you.

1028
01:07:56,864 --> 01:07:59,592
So they're searching into the past.

1029
01:08:03,621 --> 01:08:06,373
They shan't ever find
out, my darling.

1030
01:08:06,374 --> 01:08:08,351
I promise you.

1031
01:08:11,254 --> 01:08:15,340
- Elizabeth Flynn, where are yez?
- I'm here, Mr. Roderick.

1032
01:08:15,341 --> 01:08:18,635
And will you please
come here at once?

1033
01:08:18,636 --> 01:08:21,722
Don't we get any breakfast?
What's the matter?

1034
01:08:21,723 --> 01:08:24,933
Oh, that. That happened last night.

1035
01:08:24,934 --> 01:08:27,477
I am not talking about that.

1036
01:08:27,478 --> 01:08:30,772
- I'm talking about this.
- The anagram letters. Yes, yes.

1037
01:08:30,773 --> 01:08:32,524
Anagrams, is it?

1038
01:08:32,525 --> 01:08:35,652
Don't you try to bluff
me, Mr. Roderick.

1039
01:08:35,653 --> 01:08:38,071
'Tis a heathen device to
call devils out of hell.

1040
01:08:38,072 --> 01:08:40,490
Stop looking at me as though you
were gonna take away my bicycle.

1041
01:08:40,491 --> 01:08:44,536
I will not stay in a house where it
goes on, and that is an "ultimato"!

1042
01:08:44,537 --> 01:08:48,624
Come now, Lizzie. From now on
we're through with all this rubbish.

1043
01:08:48,625 --> 01:08:51,251
- We're going after facts.
- What facts?

1044
01:08:51,252 --> 01:08:53,045
The facts about this
blasted haunting.

1045
01:08:53,046 --> 01:08:55,672
Rick, why burden Lizzie with this?

1046
01:08:55,673 --> 01:08:59,217
Whist now, Miss Pam.
Where will we start, Mr. Rick?

1047
01:08:59,218 --> 01:09:01,261
I don't know. Everybody
seems to be dead.

1048
01:09:01,262 --> 01:09:04,014
- The trained nurse isn't.
- What trained nurse?

1049
01:09:04,015 --> 01:09:07,392
She was here when it happened... the friend
of the lady that went over the cliff.

1050
01:09:07,393 --> 01:09:09,269
Where did you hear all this?

1051
01:09:09,270 --> 01:09:12,773
What do you suppose we
talk of at the Jessups?

1052
01:09:12,774 --> 01:09:16,068
It was the trained nurse that shouted
down to Mr. Jessup on the shore.

1053
01:09:16,069 --> 01:09:19,613
- Was Jessup in on the tragedy?
- He was after some lost sheep.

1054
01:09:19,614 --> 01:09:21,698
The tide was out, so he went down.

1055
01:09:21,699 --> 01:09:24,910
And as he passed under the
dead tree, he heard a scream.

1056
01:09:24,911 --> 01:09:26,370
- Mrs. Meredith?
- No.

1057
01:09:26,371 --> 01:09:29,081
'Twas the scream of
a terrified child.

1058
01:09:29,082 --> 01:09:33,001
As he ran towards it, the
poor lady came crashing down.

1059
01:09:33,002 --> 01:09:37,297
- 'Twas then that the nurse called.
- Lizzie Flynn, you're a gold mine.

1060
01:09:37,298 --> 01:09:42,029
- If we could only get the name of the nurse.
- Ah, that's easy. Wait, now.

1061
01:09:43,638 --> 01:09:46,473
- Mr. Jessup?
- Yes, Mrs. Flynn.

1062
01:09:46,474 --> 01:09:49,184
What was the name of
Mrs. Meredith's trained nurse...

1063
01:09:49,185 --> 01:09:51,436
the one that got so
famous and grand?

1064
01:09:51,437 --> 01:09:55,857
- Miss Holloway.
- Aye. Miss Holloway.

1065
01:09:55,858 --> 01:09:59,152
She has a big, fine place of
her own now. A hospital, like.

1066
01:09:59,153 --> 01:10:04,635
'Tis on Bodmin Moor. She calls
it the Mary Meredith Retreat.

1067
01:10:14,252 --> 01:10:16,920
- Mr. and Miss Fitzgerald?
- Yes.

1068
01:10:16,921 --> 01:10:19,649
- Won't you come in?
- Thank you.

1069
01:10:25,513 --> 01:10:30,119
Wait in there, please, and I will
announce you to Miss Holloway.

1070
01:10:48,202 --> 01:10:50,976
The place is quite
stunning, isn't it?

1071
01:10:51,622 --> 01:10:55,022
- Why are you whispering?
- Why are you?

1072
01:11:16,814 --> 01:11:18,815
A gentleman!

1073
01:11:18,816 --> 01:11:22,068
- How very unusual.
- Good afternoon.

1074
01:11:22,069 --> 01:11:25,697
Oh, dear me. Yes. Good afternoon.

1075
01:11:25,698 --> 01:11:27,846
Good afternoon.

1076
01:11:30,703 --> 01:11:33,872
Are you by any chance waiting
to see Miss Holloway?

1077
01:11:33,873 --> 01:11:36,192
Yes, we have an appointment.

1078
01:11:36,626 --> 01:11:38,627
What lucky people!

1079
01:11:38,628 --> 01:11:42,964
And what luck for me too, because
I'm sure you won't mind.

1080
01:11:42,965 --> 01:11:46,134
- But perhaps you will.
- Is there something we can do?

1081
01:11:46,135 --> 01:11:49,679
Oh, if you'd be so
very kind. You see...

1082
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:54,911
this isn't my day for an interview
and I want her to have these.

1083
01:11:56,521 --> 01:11:59,420
What are they, bird's eggs?

1084
01:12:00,233 --> 01:12:05,635
But that's very funny, because,
you see, I'm Miss Bird.

1085
01:12:10,952 --> 01:12:13,829
They're just little stones...

1086
01:12:13,830 --> 01:12:20,043
because she likes simple things
and she has so many flowers.

1087
01:12:20,044 --> 01:12:24,548
- There isn't much else one can find.
- Well, I'll give them to her.

1088
01:12:24,549 --> 01:12:26,132
Thank you.

1089
01:12:26,133 --> 01:12:30,454
And now, I... think I'll just
go out for a little walk.

1090
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:38,084
Go back to your work
at once, Miss Bird.

1091
01:12:41,566 --> 01:12:43,525
Don't forget.

1092
01:12:43,526 --> 01:12:46,254
Will you come this way, please?

1093
01:12:47,613 --> 01:12:51,074
- Shall I take them?
- No, I'll deliver them.

1094
01:12:51,075 --> 01:12:53,143
As you wish.

1095
01:12:58,708 --> 01:13:00,401
Come in.

1096
01:13:03,838 --> 01:13:05,338
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

1097
01:13:05,339 --> 01:13:07,048
This is so kind of you.

1098
01:13:07,049 --> 01:13:10,010
I was asked to give you these
by a Miss Bird, I believe.

1099
01:13:10,011 --> 01:13:12,721
Poor Miss Bird. Our saddest case.

1100
01:13:12,722 --> 01:13:15,098
They're really very fine
stones, aren't they?

1101
01:13:15,099 --> 01:13:17,058
I must remember to
thank her for them.

1102
01:13:17,059 --> 01:13:19,603
She comes to me once a
week for a little chat.

1103
01:13:19,604 --> 01:13:21,438
- Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.

1104
01:13:21,439 --> 01:13:25,025
Forgive our ignorance. We know
so very little of your work.

1105
01:13:25,026 --> 01:13:27,110
Is it with mental patients?

1106
01:13:27,111 --> 01:13:30,196
Not patients, Miss Fitzgerald.
Just guests.

1107
01:13:30,197 --> 01:13:32,365
In a way this is like a hotel...

1108
01:13:32,366 --> 01:13:35,076
where there are beautiful things
to look at, music to hear...

1109
01:13:35,077 --> 01:13:37,287
and a little sympathy.

1110
01:13:37,288 --> 01:13:39,811
But don't let's talk about me.

1111
01:13:40,791 --> 01:13:44,461
You told me on the telephone
about disturbances at Windward.

1112
01:13:44,462 --> 01:13:45,879
How can I help you?

1113
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:50,425
We thought perhaps you could tell us
what Mary and Carmel were really like.

1114
01:13:50,426 --> 01:13:53,530
They were extraordinary
women, both of them.

1115
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:57,015
Mary Meredith was the finest
human being I ever knew.

1116
01:13:57,016 --> 01:13:59,893
- Is that she?
- Yes.

1117
01:13:59,894 --> 01:14:03,980
- And Carmel?
- Oh, she was exceptional too.

1118
01:14:03,981 --> 01:14:06,816
I never saw such intensity of evil.

1119
01:14:06,817 --> 01:14:10,862
She was a Spanish gypsy.
Crafty, cruel.

1120
01:14:10,863 --> 01:14:14,491
- I'm sorry.
- Why did Mrs. Meredith put up with it?

1121
01:14:14,492 --> 01:14:17,410
She thought Meredith should
be the one to end the affair.

1122
01:14:17,411 --> 01:14:19,746
- And did he?
- Yes, in time.

1123
01:14:19,747 --> 01:14:21,915
She and Meredith
took the girl to Paris...

1124
01:14:21,916 --> 01:14:25,293
found a position for her, left
her well supplied with money.

1125
01:14:25,294 --> 01:14:28,046
Then they came back
here with their baby.

1126
01:14:28,047 --> 01:14:31,424
For a time it seemed as if there
were some possibility of happiness.

1127
01:14:31,425 --> 01:14:34,678
- And then?
- Carmel came back.

1128
01:14:34,679 --> 01:14:39,724
She still wanted Mary's husband.
You know how it ended.

1129
01:14:39,725 --> 01:14:43,186
A neighbor of ours spoke of something
we can't quite understand.

1130
01:14:43,187 --> 01:14:45,730
He mentions a child crying
on the cliff that night.

1131
01:14:45,731 --> 01:14:48,129
A terrified child.

1132
01:14:49,777 --> 01:14:54,906
That's a part of the story so ugly,
I've never mentioned it before.

1133
01:14:54,907 --> 01:14:57,430
We're sorry to distress you.

1134
01:14:58,577 --> 01:15:02,539
That night, the girl Carmel had
been told she must leave Windward.

1135
01:15:02,540 --> 01:15:06,334
If she could've killed both Mary and
her husband, she'd have done so.

1136
01:15:06,335 --> 01:15:09,379
A better plan flashed into
her wicked little brain.

1137
01:15:09,380 --> 01:15:12,966
She went into the nursery, picked up
their baby, and raced to the cliff.

1138
01:15:12,967 --> 01:15:15,593
- Good heavens!
- Mary was after her in a second...

1139
01:15:15,594 --> 01:15:20,825
Meredith and I close behind. Carmel
reached the cliff by the dead tree.

1140
01:15:21,267 --> 01:15:24,102
For a moment I saw
them struggling...

1141
01:15:24,103 --> 01:15:27,897
then Carmel raised her arm
and struck Mary down.

1142
01:15:27,898 --> 01:15:29,607
Then it was murder?

1143
01:15:29,608 --> 01:15:31,860
The will to kill had always
been there, I think.

1144
01:15:31,861 --> 01:15:35,905
Directed against Stella.
Can that be what survives?

1145
01:15:35,906 --> 01:15:39,034
Maybe that accounts for Stella's
queer business on the cliff.

1146
01:15:39,035 --> 01:15:40,952
- What was that?
- Something in that house...

1147
01:15:40,953 --> 01:15:45,040
drove her out toward the edge, and if
I hadn't caught her, she'd have gone over.

1148
01:15:45,041 --> 01:15:47,235
Would she indeed?

1149
01:15:48,377 --> 01:15:50,003
How very curious.

1150
01:15:50,004 --> 01:15:52,527
Please, finish your story.

1151
01:15:53,883 --> 01:15:55,925
It was finished.

1152
01:15:55,926 --> 01:15:58,428
Everything was finished.

1153
01:15:58,429 --> 01:16:00,702
Meredith went down the cliff.

1154
01:16:02,183 --> 01:16:05,143
Mary was dead when he reached her.

1155
01:16:05,144 --> 01:16:08,563
- And Carmel?
- She ran out into the storm.

1156
01:16:08,564 --> 01:16:12,817
Next morning, she crawled back
in the early stages of pneumonia.

1157
01:16:12,818 --> 01:16:16,780
I fought for Carmel's
life day and night...

1158
01:16:16,781 --> 01:16:19,240
hating her all the time!

1159
01:16:19,241 --> 01:16:21,409
How awful for you.

1160
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:28,064
I'm sorry, I discipline others.
I... I can't discipline myself.

1161
01:16:30,252 --> 01:16:34,172
There. Have I told you
everything you want to know?

1162
01:16:34,173 --> 01:16:36,049
All except one thing.

1163
01:16:36,050 --> 01:16:39,052
That last night, who
told Carmel she must go?

1164
01:16:39,053 --> 01:16:42,472
Why, Mary... I should say Meredith.

1165
01:16:42,473 --> 01:16:45,892
It's the one decent thing
I ever knew him to do.

1166
01:16:45,893 --> 01:16:48,997
This... This is all extremely...

1167
01:16:50,189 --> 01:16:52,132
I'm sorry.

1168
01:16:53,067 --> 01:16:55,443
May I offer you tea?

1169
01:16:55,444 --> 01:16:58,238
Thank you, but we must get
back before our maid leaves.

1170
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:00,698
She won't stay at
Windward after dark.

1171
01:17:00,699 --> 01:17:03,159
I'm afraid I haven't been
much help with your problem.

1172
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:05,787
Well, thank you
anyway, and good-bye.

1173
01:17:05,788 --> 01:17:08,391
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

1174
01:17:32,523 --> 01:17:34,842
Good afternoon, my dear.

1175
01:17:36,652 --> 01:17:39,904
- Did you want to see me?
- I've been asking for you all day.

1176
01:17:39,905 --> 01:17:42,157
I'm being treated as
though I were insane.

1177
01:17:42,158 --> 01:17:44,075
Has anyone used that word?

1178
01:17:44,076 --> 01:17:47,370
- I've told them a thousand times...
- It isn't a question of a word.

1179
01:17:47,371 --> 01:17:50,748
My door's kept locked, and there's
a queer look in their eyes.

1180
01:17:50,749 --> 01:17:55,378
- Oh, you feel persecuted.
- No.

1181
01:17:55,379 --> 01:17:58,673
About the cliff at
Windward, Stella...

1182
01:17:58,674 --> 01:18:01,778
what did you feel as
you ran toward it?

1183
01:18:02,303 --> 01:18:04,762
I didn't feel anything.

1184
01:18:04,763 --> 01:18:06,681
I was sad in the house.

1185
01:18:06,682 --> 01:18:09,392
Was it as though some will
were directing you...

1186
01:18:09,393 --> 01:18:15,315
- a will stronger than yours?
- The sea sounded loud and beautiful.

1187
01:18:15,316 --> 01:18:19,027
- I just went in that direction.
- In fact, you don't quite know.

1188
01:18:19,028 --> 01:18:22,322
- I want to see my grandfather.
- You will in time.

1189
01:18:22,323 --> 01:18:26,098
Does Grandfather know
what this place is like?

1190
01:18:26,869 --> 01:18:29,037
That woman who laughs...

1191
01:18:29,038 --> 01:18:32,081
I hear laughing all night!
And that other woman that...

1192
01:18:32,082 --> 01:18:34,709
Your grandfather's sorry
that you have to be here...

1193
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:37,337
but he knows you'll be better soon.

1194
01:18:37,338 --> 01:18:40,548
"Better"? But I'm
perfectly all right!

1195
01:18:40,549 --> 01:18:43,259
I wouldn't say that, Stella dear.

1196
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:46,054
And please don't keep
asking to see me.

1197
01:18:46,055 --> 01:18:49,182
Why do you hate me, Miss Holloway?

1198
01:18:49,183 --> 01:18:53,413
You see? You do feel persecuted.

1199
01:19:05,741 --> 01:19:08,034
Rick, if I should ever
happen to lose my mind...

1200
01:19:08,035 --> 01:19:11,287
I don't think you'll lose it.
It might rattle to one side.

1201
01:19:11,288 --> 01:19:14,499
But if I do, no Mary
Meredith Retreat for me.

1202
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:18,795
Plain, old-fashioned lunatic
asylum, not that creepy horror.

1203
01:19:18,796 --> 01:19:22,048
You'll have a lovely talk with
Miss Holloway once a week.

1204
01:19:22,049 --> 01:19:25,260
- You think she was lying to us?
- About the past? Why should she?

1205
01:19:25,261 --> 01:19:28,846
She wasn't gonna tell us about the baby,
and later she made that one break.

1206
01:19:28,847 --> 01:19:31,140
Admitting it was Mary
who told Carmel to go.

1207
01:19:31,141 --> 01:19:34,644
Why try to hide it? It was
a normal human reaction.

1208
01:19:34,645 --> 01:19:37,021
Made me like Mary better,
as a matter of fact.

1209
01:19:37,022 --> 01:19:39,816
I was getting awfully bored
with her perfection.

1210
01:19:39,817 --> 01:19:43,069
Why should Miss Holloway want to
turn her into a plaster saint?

1211
01:19:43,070 --> 01:19:47,490
Maybe she likes plaster saints.
She's one herself.

1212
01:19:47,491 --> 01:19:48,533
Thank you, Doctor.

1213
01:19:48,534 --> 01:19:52,203
I assure you that when that healthy young
man laughs, he isn't being delirious.

1214
01:19:52,204 --> 01:19:54,022
Good-bye, Doctor.

1215
01:19:54,540 --> 01:19:57,359
- Hello. Come in.
- Hello.

1216
01:19:59,211 --> 01:20:02,672
- What news of Stella?
- None, and I won't be having any.

1217
01:20:02,673 --> 01:20:05,883
Her grandfather's kicked me out.
Where have you been all day?

1218
01:20:05,884 --> 01:20:08,720
- To Bodmin Moor and back.
- Seeing a Miss Holloway.

1219
01:20:08,721 --> 01:20:11,097
What, Holy Holloway of
"wealth through harmony"?

1220
01:20:11,098 --> 01:20:13,641
- What do you know about her?
- Nothing, except that...

1221
01:20:13,642 --> 01:20:16,811
Dr. Rudd, my predecessor, had some
sort of prejudice against her.

1222
01:20:16,812 --> 01:20:19,022
She says Carmel
killed Mary Meredith.

1223
01:20:19,023 --> 01:20:20,982
Yes, she was there.
Nursed Carmel afterwards.

1224
01:20:20,983 --> 01:20:25,259
- Could we talk to Dr. Rudd about her?
- Only if we have another séance.

1225
01:20:25,779 --> 01:20:27,864
- I wonder...
- What?

1226
01:20:27,865 --> 01:20:32,391
It's only the very faintest chance,
of course, but come on upstairs.

1227
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:38,708
190s to '11, '12 to
'15, '16 to '19.

1228
01:20:38,709 --> 01:20:40,168
Here we are.

1229
01:20:40,169 --> 01:20:43,963
- It happened in the winter.
- Yes, let's start with November.

1230
01:20:43,964 --> 01:20:46,841
From his handwriting, Dr. Rudd
must have been 200 years old.

1231
01:20:46,842 --> 01:20:51,554
Measles, measles, measles, whooping
cough, measles, appendicitis...

1232
01:20:51,555 --> 01:20:54,098
Pleasant change for the old boy.

1233
01:20:54,099 --> 01:20:56,934
Here we are. "Called
to Windward House.

1234
01:20:56,935 --> 01:21:00,146
Meredith's model, Carmel
Quesada: double pneumonia."

1235
01:21:00,147 --> 01:21:03,649
"Quesada girl much worse. No
attempt to warm the bedroom.

1236
01:21:03,650 --> 01:21:07,737
- Found traces of snow on the floor."
- Snow? Then the window was left open.

1237
01:21:07,738 --> 01:21:09,572
"Spoke severely to nurse.

1238
01:21:09,573 --> 01:21:13,117
Returned to Windward this
evening. Patient dead.

1239
01:21:13,118 --> 01:21:15,745
Nurse Holloway threatened
me with legal action...

1240
01:21:15,746 --> 01:21:18,539
when I used the words
'criminal negligence."

1241
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:20,708
- But that means...
- To a doctor of Rudd's generation...

1242
01:21:20,709 --> 01:21:22,460
it was apt to mean murder.

1243
01:21:22,461 --> 01:21:25,213
- Miss Holloway murdered Carmel.
- Doctor.

1244
01:21:25,214 --> 01:21:27,715
- In a quiet, ladylike way.
- Doctor!

1245
01:21:27,716 --> 01:21:28,758
Yes, Edith?

1246
01:21:28,759 --> 01:21:32,512
The commander's maid's on the
phone. You're to come at once.

1247
01:21:32,513 --> 01:21:34,972
- Is it Miss Meredith?
- It's the commander.

1248
01:21:34,973 --> 01:21:39,060
- Took awful bad, the maid says.
- All right, Edith. You take this home.

1249
01:21:39,061 --> 01:21:42,461
There may be some other details.
I'll be along later.

1250
01:21:44,525 --> 01:21:46,627
He's in here, Doctor.

1251
01:21:48,987 --> 01:21:52,591
I undid his shoes. It was
all I knew how to do.

1252
01:21:53,450 --> 01:21:57,036
- Bad one this time, Scott.
- Yes, I know.

1253
01:21:57,037 --> 01:21:59,185
Hold that under his nose.

1254
01:22:07,548 --> 01:22:10,174
Want an apology, Scott?

1255
01:22:10,175 --> 01:22:13,469
You'd get it, if you
stuck out for it.

1256
01:22:13,470 --> 01:22:16,870
No, thanks. I'll have
you right in a jiffy.

1257
01:22:20,769 --> 01:22:24,339
- Who's there?
- Who do you suppose is there?

1258
01:22:29,194 --> 01:22:30,570
Hello, Lizzie.

1259
01:22:30,571 --> 01:22:34,031
I'm sitting in your mother's chair,
and if any ghost comes along...

1260
01:22:34,032 --> 01:22:36,701
I'll let out a scream that will
frighten the life out of it.

1261
01:22:36,702 --> 01:22:38,286
Why? What's happened?

1262
01:22:38,287 --> 01:22:41,581
I feel all the wickedness of
this house gathering around.

1263
01:22:41,582 --> 01:22:44,500
- Come on, now. Hop off to the Jessups'.
- I'm not going.

1264
01:22:44,501 --> 01:22:47,003
I'll be found dead in me
bed in the morning...

1265
01:22:47,004 --> 01:22:49,922
stiff with fright, and
me death will be on you.

1266
01:22:49,923 --> 01:22:50,756
Me?

1267
01:22:50,757 --> 01:22:54,093
How do I know what devilment you'll
be up to when me back is turned?

1268
01:22:54,094 --> 01:22:57,388
I promise we'll do nothing tonight
that the priest wouldn't approve of.

1269
01:22:57,389 --> 01:23:01,309
Lord bless you, Mr. Rick.
I was hoping you'd say that.

1270
01:23:01,310 --> 01:23:04,163
I'll go and get me hat and coat.

1271
01:23:07,232 --> 01:23:10,109
- Find anything new?
- Nothing after that entry.

1272
01:23:10,110 --> 01:23:14,636
- How about a whiskey and soda?
- Less soda than usual, thanks.

1273
01:23:18,035 --> 01:23:20,536
Awful if we took to
drink, both of us.

1274
01:23:20,537 --> 01:23:23,039
But it's an ideal house
for delirium tremens.

1275
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:28,169
Before you take a sip...
don't you smell mimosa?

1276
01:23:28,170 --> 01:23:31,380
Yes. Are you scared?

1277
01:23:31,381 --> 01:23:33,966
Well, I wish I'd wake up.

1278
01:23:33,967 --> 01:23:36,991
It came from the
nursery last night.

1279
01:23:44,770 --> 01:23:49,592
- You have the great nose of the family.
- Not a trace of it now.

1280
01:23:58,325 --> 01:24:01,895
- It's strongest here.
- It's almost overpowering.

1281
01:24:02,371 --> 01:24:04,997
I wish you'd tell us what
you want, Mary Meredith.

1282
01:24:04,998 --> 01:24:06,707
- Mr. Rick?
- Yes?

1283
01:24:06,708 --> 01:24:10,294
I forgot to ask: Did you
find out anything today?

1284
01:24:10,295 --> 01:24:15,242
- Just turned up a couple of murders.
- Holy saints preserve us!

1285
01:24:15,634 --> 01:24:19,455
Answer the door.
It's probably Dr. Scott.

1286
01:24:21,265 --> 01:24:23,391
- Good evening, Dr. Scott.
- Evening, Lizzie.

1287
01:24:23,392 --> 01:24:25,601
- In here.
- Good night, Miss Pam.

1288
01:24:25,602 --> 01:24:27,019
- Good night.
- Good night.

1289
01:24:27,020 --> 01:24:29,605
- I'm glad to find you here.
- How's the commander?

1290
01:24:29,606 --> 01:24:31,774
It's not him I'm worried
about. It's Stella.

1291
01:24:31,775 --> 01:24:34,068
- What's the matter with her?
- She's at Miss Holloway's.

1292
01:24:34,069 --> 01:24:36,821
- No!
- We've got to get her out, tonight.

1293
01:24:36,822 --> 01:24:39,574
That's the way I feel, but
don't let's get hysterical.

1294
01:24:39,575 --> 01:24:41,701
After all, Miss Holloway was
her mother's best friend.

1295
01:24:41,702 --> 01:24:45,037
The idea of her spending an
hour in that place is horrible.

1296
01:24:45,038 --> 01:24:48,249
- Can you get the old boy's permission?
- He's too ill. We've no authority.

1297
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:50,876
- Then we'll do it without.
- Shall we take the casebook?

1298
01:24:50,877 --> 01:24:53,921
- Might be able to frighten her with it.
- Yes. No, wait.

1299
01:24:53,922 --> 01:24:56,340
We'll describe what we found
and then pile it on, huh?

1300
01:24:56,341 --> 01:24:58,443
Let's get to a telephone.

1301
01:25:06,310 --> 01:25:07,957
Yes?

1302
01:25:10,564 --> 01:25:14,942
Oh, it's no bother at all, Miss Fitzgerald.
I'll be glad to see you again.

1303
01:25:14,943 --> 01:25:16,920
Are you motoring?

1304
01:25:17,321 --> 01:25:19,405
In two hours.

1305
01:25:19,406 --> 01:25:21,179
Good-bye.

1306
01:25:27,539 --> 01:25:29,937
Bring in Miss Meredith.

1307
01:25:33,253 --> 01:25:35,947
I may need the car this evening.

1308
01:25:53,106 --> 01:25:56,506
Good evening, my dear. Come in.

1309
01:25:59,988 --> 01:26:01,761
Sit down.

1310
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:05,493
I thought you'd feel
more at home here.

1311
01:26:05,494 --> 01:26:07,203
I do, Miss Holloway.

1312
01:26:07,204 --> 01:26:10,081
I've been giving your problem
the most serious consideration.

1313
01:26:10,082 --> 01:26:13,751
It's not much of a problem.
I just want to go home.

1314
01:26:13,752 --> 01:26:16,295
To your grandfather's?

1315
01:26:16,296 --> 01:26:21,217
I couldn't permit that.
You've never been very happy there.

1316
01:26:21,218 --> 01:26:25,346
- Where would you really like to be?
- You mean Windward?

1317
01:26:25,347 --> 01:26:30,578
That's the basis of all your
trouble, being kept away from there.

1318
01:26:32,104 --> 01:26:37,817
- Do you think she wants you there?
- Yes, I think she does.

1319
01:26:37,818 --> 01:26:41,297
And what she wants, I want.

1320
01:26:42,280 --> 01:26:45,241
I've talked with the Fitzgeralds.
They're very fond of you.

1321
01:26:45,242 --> 01:26:47,410
They'll let me stay
there with them?

1322
01:26:47,411 --> 01:26:51,080
For the present, your grandfather's
not to know you've left here.

1323
01:26:51,081 --> 01:26:53,082
It would worry him.

1324
01:26:53,083 --> 01:26:56,232
You must go straight to Windward.

1325
01:26:56,962 --> 01:26:58,754
Is that clear?

1326
01:26:58,755 --> 01:27:03,201
Miss Holloway, I'm the
happiest person in the world!

1327
01:27:04,428 --> 01:27:06,906
There's a train in 40 minutes.

1328
01:27:07,597 --> 01:27:10,325
My car will take you
to the station.

1329
01:27:23,113 --> 01:27:25,807
Good evening. Won't you come in?

1330
01:27:27,409 --> 01:27:31,935
- I must announce you!
- Don't bother. We'll announce ourselves.

1331
01:27:36,793 --> 01:27:39,628
Good evening. So you've
thought of more questions?

1332
01:27:39,629 --> 01:27:43,549
- Why didn't you tell us Stella was here?
- The presence of my guests is confidential.

1333
01:27:43,550 --> 01:27:45,885
- We've come to take her.
- This is Stella's doctor.

1334
01:27:45,886 --> 01:27:50,014
Oh, I begin to understand.
This is a rescue party.

1335
01:27:50,015 --> 01:27:52,183
Take me to Stella at once.

1336
01:27:52,184 --> 01:27:54,810
There was a time when I would have
resented such impertinence...

1337
01:27:54,811 --> 01:27:57,938
particularly from a doctor whose
conduct leaves so much to be desired.

1338
01:27:57,939 --> 01:28:01,942
- Please stop beating about the bush.
- I couldn't be angry with anyone tonight.

1339
01:28:01,943 --> 01:28:05,279
You know, those moments when
the light is very clear...

1340
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:08,908
when the scales at last
swing into perfect balance.

1341
01:28:08,909 --> 01:28:12,244
- Where is Stella?
- Tell them, Miss Ellis.

1342
01:28:12,245 --> 01:28:14,955
She's on the train for
Biddlecombe. The 9:20.

1343
01:28:14,956 --> 01:28:17,605
On her way home.

1344
01:28:18,001 --> 01:28:20,795
- Is that true?
- She'll be there long before you.

1345
01:28:20,796 --> 01:28:22,588
- What happened?
- Nothing.

1346
01:28:22,589 --> 01:28:26,759
She wasn't very happy here. I can't be
of any help to people who are unhappy.

1347
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:29,094
- She went to her grandfather's?
- No.

1348
01:28:29,095 --> 01:28:31,847
- Not to Windward House?
- Better than that.

1349
01:28:31,848 --> 01:28:34,767
To the cliff, and the
rocks below the cliff.

1350
01:28:34,768 --> 01:28:36,101
You let her?

1351
01:28:36,102 --> 01:28:40,439
That's were Mary went.
That's where she died.

1352
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:43,818
She's out of her mind. Come on!
Stella has a 20-minute start!

1353
01:28:43,819 --> 01:28:46,695
The sea has such a lonely sauna.

1354
01:28:46,696 --> 01:28:48,823
- Every seventh wave...
- You'd better look after her.

1355
01:28:48,824 --> 01:28:52,409
Miss Holloway! What's the matter?

1356
01:28:52,410 --> 01:28:54,808
Get out of this room!

1357
01:28:56,665 --> 01:28:59,333
I've done what she wanted at last.

1358
01:28:59,334 --> 01:29:01,544
Haven't I, Mary?

1359
01:29:01,545 --> 01:29:04,114
It's all straight now.

1360
01:29:04,506 --> 01:29:09,218
There are no frayed edges.
No loose ends.

1361
01:29:09,219 --> 01:29:11,242
All straight.

1362
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:13,282
All smooth.

1363
01:29:18,687 --> 01:29:22,606
These local trains are very slow, you know.
But this one had a head start.

1364
01:29:22,607 --> 01:29:25,234
You needn't worry. She
can't get into the house.

1365
01:29:25,235 --> 01:29:29,511
- You did lock the door, didn't you, Pam?
- No, I thought you did.

1366
01:29:40,250 --> 01:29:42,334
- Will you be all right, miss?
- Oh, yes.

1367
01:29:42,335 --> 01:29:45,609
I'll be all right now.
I'll be with my friends.

1368
01:30:18,079 --> 01:30:20,773
Pamela? Rick?

1369
01:30:26,630 --> 01:30:28,858
Pamela, are you there?

1370
01:30:30,842 --> 01:30:32,569
Rick?

1371
01:30:38,850 --> 01:30:41,044
Where are you? Please.

1372
01:30:59,329 --> 01:31:01,330
Lizzie?

1373
01:31:01,331 --> 01:31:03,229
Is that you?

1374
01:31:16,262 --> 01:31:18,114
Stella.

1375
01:31:22,686 --> 01:31:24,538
Stella.

1376
01:31:30,902 --> 01:31:33,529
Grandfather! Grandfather!

1377
01:31:33,530 --> 01:31:35,948
Stella, my child.

1378
01:31:35,949 --> 01:31:38,993
What's the matter?
What are you doing here?

1379
01:31:38,994 --> 01:31:42,496
Someone telephoned...
from Miss Holloway's.

1380
01:31:42,497 --> 01:31:45,249
And you walked all that way?

1381
01:31:45,250 --> 01:31:47,209
Well, I had to get here.

1382
01:31:47,210 --> 01:31:50,838
Don't try and talk, darling.
I'll get Dr. Scott.

1383
01:31:50,839 --> 01:31:53,340
Oh, dear. There's no
telephone in this house.

1384
01:31:53,341 --> 01:31:56,635
- Go. Go!
- You can't be left alone.

1385
01:31:56,636 --> 01:31:59,054
But the danger is for you.

1386
01:31:59,055 --> 01:32:02,766
- Please get out of this house now.
- Now lie back quietly.

1387
01:32:02,767 --> 01:32:04,869
I'm not afraid of anything here.

1388
01:32:06,354 --> 01:32:11,191
Then be afraid. Be afraid,
for heaven's sake.

1389
01:32:11,192 --> 01:32:15,237
When you were a little child...
after her death...

1390
01:32:15,238 --> 01:32:18,449
the evils of this house
reached out for you.

1391
01:32:18,450 --> 01:32:20,868
I took you away then.

1392
01:32:20,869 --> 01:32:25,850
- If I could only take you now.
- It's all right. We're together.

1393
01:32:36,843 --> 01:32:39,636
Stella! Go!

1394
01:32:39,637 --> 01:32:42,240
- Go...
- Grandfather!

1395
01:32:52,859 --> 01:32:55,382
I won't be afraid, Mother.

1396
01:33:05,705 --> 01:33:07,478
Stella!

1397
01:33:10,085 --> 01:33:11,732
Stella!

1398
01:33:13,463 --> 01:33:15,657
Stella, stop!

1399
01:33:21,179 --> 01:33:23,077
Hold on, darling.

1400
01:33:26,559 --> 01:33:29,629
We've got you now,
darling. Hang on.

1401
01:33:35,318 --> 01:33:37,069
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

1402
01:33:37,070 --> 01:33:38,487
Sure?

1403
01:33:38,488 --> 01:33:42,699
Dr. Scott, Grandfather's in
the studio. He's terribly ill.

1404
01:33:42,700 --> 01:33:45,269
We'd better get to him at once.

1405
01:33:54,003 --> 01:33:56,046
There's nothing I can do, my dear.

1406
01:33:56,047 --> 01:33:57,774
I knew.

1407
01:33:59,134 --> 01:34:02,469
She killed him just as
she tried to kill me.

1408
01:34:02,470 --> 01:34:04,930
- My own mother!
- No, Stella.

1409
01:34:04,931 --> 01:34:07,975
But I tell you, I saw my mother
just as my father painted her.

1410
01:34:07,976 --> 01:34:10,686
- It must have been Carmel.
- It wasn't.

1411
01:34:10,687 --> 01:34:12,437
Steady, Stella.

1412
01:34:12,438 --> 01:34:14,256
Unless...

1413
01:34:14,816 --> 01:34:18,026
Unless perhaps Miss
Holloway was right.

1414
01:34:18,027 --> 01:34:20,904
Perhaps it's my mind.

1415
01:34:20,905 --> 01:34:23,133
- Oh, Rick!
- No, darling.

1416
01:34:27,245 --> 01:34:29,705
The mimosa scent...
it's flooding the room.

1417
01:34:29,706 --> 01:34:31,498
It's all right, darling.
Nothing will hurt you.

1418
01:34:31,499 --> 01:34:36,545
But I'm not frightened. This is what
I felt in the nursery that night.

1419
01:34:36,546 --> 01:34:38,380
The book!

1420
01:34:38,381 --> 01:34:40,382
What's doing it?

1421
01:34:40,383 --> 01:34:43,886
- The wind.
- But what about the mimosa?

1422
01:34:43,887 --> 01:34:47,639
We're letting our imaginations
play hob with our senses.

1423
01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:53,145
"11:15 a.m. Mary Ann Hardy.
Broken arm. Second this year."

1424
01:34:53,146 --> 01:34:55,544
It's imagination, all right.

1425
01:34:57,442 --> 01:35:01,153
- Oh, what did I expect?
- Wait a minute.

1426
01:35:01,154 --> 01:35:03,363
"3:20 p.m. Called to
Windward House...

1427
01:35:03,364 --> 01:35:05,949
to attend Meredith's
model, who had fainted.

1428
01:35:05,950 --> 01:35:09,224
It didn't take much skill
to find the reason.

1429
01:35:09,662 --> 01:35:11,455
Girl in poor physical condition...

1430
01:35:11,456 --> 01:35:14,666
but I'm sure her great happiness
will carry her through."

1431
01:35:14,667 --> 01:35:18,921
- Then Carmel had a baby too!
- "5:10 p.m. Mrs. Meredith came to see me.

1432
01:35:18,922 --> 01:35:22,633
Expected tears, hysteria.
Instead, icy control...

1433
01:35:22,634 --> 01:35:26,011
and a dominating desire that the
girl's condition be kept secret.

1434
01:35:26,012 --> 01:35:29,806
I should have more sympathy with the lady
if I did not know how she herself...

1435
01:35:29,807 --> 01:35:32,726
has feared and refused motherhood."

1436
01:35:32,727 --> 01:35:34,603
What can it all mean?

1437
01:35:34,604 --> 01:35:37,105
- Where were you born, Stella?
- In Paris.

1438
01:35:37,106 --> 01:35:40,359
Where they took Carmel before
they came back with their baby.

1439
01:35:40,360 --> 01:35:44,446
- But surely you don't think...
- I think Mary adopted Carmel's child...

1440
01:35:44,447 --> 01:35:47,491
gave her a home on the condition
that Carmel never came back.

1441
01:35:47,492 --> 01:35:50,118
Only she couldn't live up to it.
She had to be near her baby.

1442
01:35:50,119 --> 01:35:52,496
But it doesn't fit.
The mimosa scent...

1443
01:35:52,497 --> 01:35:55,290
that comes with the gentle
ghost, that was Mary's scent.

1444
01:35:55,291 --> 01:35:58,001
- Stella's father told her.
- No.

1445
01:35:58,002 --> 01:36:01,505
No, my father only wrote that
it was my mother's scent.

1446
01:36:01,506 --> 01:36:06,510
- I'm Carmel's child!
- Oh, Stella, don't mind too much.

1447
01:36:06,511 --> 01:36:10,013
"Mind"? Can't you see
what it's done for me?

1448
01:36:10,014 --> 01:36:12,432
Always there's been
something fighting in me...

1449
01:36:12,433 --> 01:36:16,228
something that couldn't be
calm and cold like Mary.

1450
01:36:16,229 --> 01:36:18,438
I can be myself now.

1451
01:36:18,439 --> 01:36:21,775
That's what she's waited all
these years to tell you.

1452
01:36:21,776 --> 01:36:25,255
Oh, Mother, now I know.

1453
01:36:34,580 --> 01:36:37,040
She's happy now.

1454
01:36:37,041 --> 01:36:41,545
- The scent's gone.
- She won't cry anymore.

1455
01:36:41,546 --> 01:36:43,505
She's gone forever.

1456
01:36:43,506 --> 01:36:46,591
Will you come back to
my house now, Stella?

1457
01:36:46,592 --> 01:36:49,445
- Come along, darling.
- All right.

1458
01:36:54,058 --> 01:36:57,019
- Get her out through the nursery, quick!
- Right.

1459
01:36:57,020 --> 01:36:58,812
- What is it, the cold?
- Go on, Pam!

1460
01:36:58,813 --> 01:37:02,258
- What are you going to do?
- Help Stella, please.

1461
01:37:13,202 --> 01:37:16,306
Mary Meredith, where are you?

1462
01:37:22,128 --> 01:37:26,214
It's time somebody faced
that icy rage of yours.

1463
01:37:26,215 --> 01:37:28,216
What do you want?

1464
01:37:28,217 --> 01:37:30,115
It's Stella, isn't it?

1465
01:37:40,104 --> 01:37:44,358
It's too late, Mary. You see,
we're on to you now.

1466
01:37:44,359 --> 01:37:48,320
You told Carmel to clear out and leave her
baby, but Meredith wouldn't stand for it.

1467
01:37:48,321 --> 01:37:49,310
To spite them,

1468
01:37:49,336 --> 01:37:53,293
you tried to kill their child and instead
went hurtling over the cliff yourself.

1469
01:37:53,826 --> 01:37:57,396
Gives your saintly legend
a black eye, doesn't it?

1470
01:37:58,623 --> 01:38:01,583
So you don't like the sound
of laughter, do you?

1471
01:38:01,584 --> 01:38:04,528
But that's all you'll
get from now on.

1472
01:38:08,091 --> 01:38:11,134
I should think you'll be on
your way now, Mary Meredith.

1473
01:38:11,135 --> 01:38:14,304
We've had enough. We're not
frightened of you anymore.

1474
01:38:14,305 --> 01:38:17,454
From now on, this house
is for the living.

1475
01:38:31,948 --> 01:38:34,301
Rick, are you all right?

1476
01:38:35,618 --> 01:38:38,016
Let' me in, Rick!

1477
01:38:39,580 --> 01:38:41,206
- Oh, Rick!
- You all right, Fitzgerald?

1478
01:38:41,207 --> 01:38:44,000
Yes, fine. She's gone, Stella.

1479
01:38:44,001 --> 01:38:45,127
Look!

1480
01:38:45,128 --> 01:38:48,422
He'd never go near
those stairs before.

1481
01:38:48,423 --> 01:38:50,549
Bobby'll be back tomorrow.

1482
01:38:50,550 --> 01:38:53,995
I think we'll be having
other plans for Bobby.

1483
01:38:54,929 --> 01:38:58,723
- You're still shaking, Rick.
- Well, I've had a narrow escape.

1484
01:38:58,724 --> 01:39:01,794
She might have been
my mother-in-law!
