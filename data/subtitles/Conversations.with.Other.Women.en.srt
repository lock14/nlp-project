2
00:00:37,423 --> 00:00:40,214
It's very respectful. A good guy, though. How're you doing?

3
00:01:49,589 --> 00:01:50,631
Wish me luck.

4
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:13,631
Thanks, but I don't drink.

5
00:02:13,714 --> 00:02:17,881
Ah, you smoke, but you don't drink?

6
00:02:20,089 --> 00:02:24,381
Well, I shouldn't do that either, but you know what?

7
00:02:26,256 --> 00:02:30,006
I thought that bridesmaids were not allowed to smoke.

8
00:02:30,089 --> 00:02:33,006
I guess I'm not a very good bridesmaid then.

9
00:02:33,089 --> 00:02:35,756
Don't be too hard on yourself.

10
00:02:35,881 --> 00:02:40,489
The only real requirement is that you fit into the dress.

11
00:02:40,589 --> 00:02:41,839
How am I doing?

12
00:02:41,923 --> 00:02:43,714
You're doing good.

13
00:02:49,923 --> 00:02:52,173
I was an alternate anyway.

14
00:02:58,856 --> 00:02:59,789
The original 7th bridesmaid

15
00:02:59,914 --> 00:03:02,456
had broken her leg in a freak accident.

16
00:03:02,581 --> 00:03:05,014
¡®Course she swore, you know - ...

17
00:03:05,098 --> 00:03:07,123
...that she'd intended to invite me earlier...

18
00:03:07,248 --> 00:03:12,581
but ahm... yeah, well... You know how it goes...

19
00:03:12,664 --> 00:03:14,248
I don't actually.

20
00:03:16,081 --> 00:03:17,956
Tell me.

21
00:03:18,081 --> 00:03:20,956
Well you? You could say

22
00:03:21,081 --> 00:03:23,539
I had a history with one of the other guests.

23
00:03:23,664 --> 00:03:26,289
A history? That sounds interesting.

24
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:29,289
Oh no, it ain't. It's terribly boring.

25
00:03:29,414 --> 00:03:31,956
No, actually that's not true. I love history.

26
00:03:33,081 --> 00:03:36,456
all those distantly related royals fucking each other...

27
00:03:36,581 --> 00:03:38,123
...ending up in tragic diseases...

28
00:03:38,248 --> 00:03:39,623
...and with retardate children.

29
00:03:39,748 --> 00:03:43,656
But this is the sad, dull, real people kind.

30
00:03:43,764 --> 00:03:45,623
Mistakes repeated endlessly.

31
00:03:45,748 --> 00:03:48,039
Lessons ... unlearned...

32
00:03:49,489 --> 00:03:52,073
Thanks. I don't drink.

33
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:53,614
You smoke, but you don't drink.

34
00:03:53,698 --> 00:03:55,073
Well, I shouldn't do that either.

35
00:03:55,156 --> 00:03:56,156
I am trying to quit.

36
00:03:56,281 --> 00:03:58,239
One bad habit at a time.

37
00:04:00,364 --> 00:04:02,364
So the bride's 8th closest friend

38
00:04:02,448 --> 00:04:04,656
I've thought about this.

39
00:04:04,781 --> 00:04:06,156
As far as I see it...

40
00:04:06,281 --> 00:04:07,698
...well the only absolute fact is that

41
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:09,906
I'm not one of the top 7 friends.

42
00:04:10,031 --> 00:04:11,698
I mean on such short notice

43
00:04:11,781 --> 00:04:12,906
she certainly could've asked

44
00:04:13,031 --> 00:04:15,948
and been rejected by several other alternatives before she invited me.

45
00:04:20,539 --> 00:04:23,123
Or you could be the only person she knew

46
00:04:23,248 --> 00:04:25,373
who would potentially fit into the dress.

47
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:29,039
Yeah. Therefore, not a friend at all.

48
00:04:29,164 --> 00:04:33,248
just a living mannequin to complete the insane symmetry

49
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:35,706
of 7 best men and 7 bridesmaids.

50
00:04:41,789 --> 00:04:42,789
Alternatively...

51
00:04:42,914 --> 00:04:45,373
you are one of her 7 closest friends, but

52
00:04:45,456 --> 00:04:47,706
the history you mentioned before...

53
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:51,456
...when the original 7th bridesmaid...

54
00:04:51,581 --> 00:04:53,664
was taken up by the freak accident.

55
00:04:53,748 --> 00:04:56,331
It gave the bride courage to

56
00:04:56,414 --> 00:04:59,664
to revive the treasured relationship.

57
00:04:59,748 --> 00:05:01,081
- No. - No?

58
00:05:01,206 --> 00:05:02,706
I don't think so.

59
00:05:02,789 --> 00:05:04,331
because we were never all that close

60
00:05:04,414 --> 00:05:06,789
even when we were close.

61
00:05:07,914 --> 00:05:09,206
There was a two-week when though - when...

62
00:05:09,331 --> 00:05:11,123
...we were almost friends.

63
00:05:11,248 --> 00:05:12,456
I think.

64
00:05:12,581 --> 00:05:15,873
But Mmm, I haven't spoken to her.

65
00:05:15,998 --> 00:05:17,789
I haven't spoken to any of these people...

66
00:05:17,914 --> 00:05:21,789
...for that matter, for ten years now.

67
00:05:21,914 --> 00:05:23,831
So that's why a pretty girl like you

68
00:05:23,914 --> 00:05:26,414
is standing all by yourself.

69
00:05:29,664 --> 00:05:31,831
Some of these people used to be my friends

70
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:33,914
but they aren't any more.

71
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,039
I get tired playing the catch up game£¬ you know

72
00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:44,623
...stuggle to remember who I am.

73
00:05:44,748 --> 00:05:46,164
And then the endless repetition of

74
00:05:46,248 --> 00:05:48,873
...what I been doing

75
00:05:48,998 --> 00:05:51,331
and who I've been doing...

76
00:05:51,414 --> 00:05:55,164
You know after I finish my prepared speech

77
00:05:55,248 --> 00:05:59,248
...I just lot of ... blankly...

78
00:05:59,373 --> 00:06:01,581
...you know - besides this...

79
00:06:01,706 --> 00:06:02,706
I see.

80
00:06:02,789 --> 00:06:05,248
These used to be my ex-husband's friends.

81
00:06:05,373 --> 00:06:07,206
Not mine.

82
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,731
So why are you here then?

83
00:06:22,106 --> 00:06:23,814
I asked myself that very question

84
00:06:23,939 --> 00:06:25,981
when I was getting on the plane.

85
00:06:26,106 --> 00:06:28,898
and I could only come up with two reasons

86
00:06:28,981 --> 00:06:29,981
neither of them very good.

87
00:06:30,064 --> 00:06:31,481
What were they?

88
00:06:31,606 --> 00:06:33,106
Curiosity.

89
00:06:33,231 --> 00:06:37,939
And... maybe because I just knew I shouldn't.

90
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:40,064
Something tells me you're trouble.

91
00:06:40,148 --> 00:06:42,273
And maybe because I had enough miles

92
00:06:42,398 --> 00:06:43,573
to make a trip for free.

93
00:06:43,656 --> 00:06:45,106
That's three reasons.

94
00:06:45,189 --> 00:06:48,064
Attention, all the single women.

95
00:06:48,148 --> 00:06:50,106
Susie's about to throw the bridal bouquet.

96
00:06:50,189 --> 00:06:52,064
Let's take it outside.

97
00:06:52,148 --> 00:06:55,939
Ah, sweet.

98
00:06:56,064 --> 00:06:59,398
Isn't that your queue?

99
00:06:59,481 --> 00:07:00,814
I'm not single.

100
00:07:00,939 --> 00:07:02,648
You said ex-husband.

101
00:07:02,773 --> 00:07:04,898
Yeah, I did.

102
00:07:09,614 --> 00:07:10,781
you remarried?

103
00:07:13,114 --> 00:07:14,864
2 years.

104
00:07:16,114 --> 00:07:18,239
It's just a ring. Gold, round.

105
00:07:18,323 --> 00:07:20,573
married women aren't supposed to be bridesmaids.

106
00:07:20,656 --> 00:07:21,656
Who says?

107
00:07:21,781 --> 00:07:24,739
Bridesmaids are brides in training.

108
00:07:24,823 --> 00:07:26,448
They are practicing.

109
00:07:26,573 --> 00:07:27,739
It is just a custom.

110
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:30,114
Bridesmaids are suppesed to be virgins.

111
00:07:30,239 --> 00:07:31,906
Well, I didn't see any virgins out there

112
00:07:31,989 --> 00:07:35,323
- did you? - I didn't check.

113
00:07:40,198 --> 00:07:45,073
Anyway, I told you I was a bad bridesmaid.

114
00:07:45,156 --> 00:07:48,989
That's what you get when you call on a second string.

115
00:07:53,114 --> 00:07:55,281
editorial note 17.

116
00:07:55,614 --> 00:07:58,114
Only one good dancing couple

117
00:07:58,239 --> 00:08:00,864
Let's go to them  when we need some dancing.

118
00:08:00,948 --> 00:08:04,406
Everybody else, let's speed up or slow down

119
00:08:04,489 --> 00:08:06,073
or black and white, or sepia tone.

120
00:08:10,398 --> 00:08:12,773
May I have a... a Shirley Tempers please.

121
00:08:15,564 --> 00:08:17,439
Did your husband come with you?

122
00:08:17,523 --> 00:08:20,189
No. He couldn't. Not on such short notice.

123
00:08:20,314 --> 00:08:21,356
What does he do?

124
00:08:21,481 --> 00:08:22,689
- Do? - for living.

125
00:08:22,814 --> 00:08:25,356
Oh, he's a cardiologist.

126
00:08:25,481 --> 00:08:26,939
We live in London.

127
00:08:27,064 --> 00:08:29,356
tell me, you... um... married?

128
00:08:29,481 --> 00:08:30,481
Not any more. I...

129
00:08:30,523 --> 00:08:33,106
...I just have a girlfriend.

130
00:08:35,189 --> 00:08:38,689
- serious? - Not at all. But I like it.

131
00:08:38,814 --> 00:08:42,606
In my opinion, when it gets too serious,  it's over.

132
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:45,439
What?

133
00:08:45,564 --> 00:08:48,773
I just know... your kind.

134
00:08:48,898 --> 00:08:51,398
I don't know if I like that.

135
00:08:51,481 --> 00:08:53,514
I know you so well.

136
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:57,056
So... your girlfriend, where is she?

137
00:08:57,481 --> 00:09:00,023
No, she's not here. She works on Saturday nights.

138
00:09:00,048 --> 00:09:02,106
She's a professional dancer.

139
00:09:02,189 --> 00:09:04,148
Not that kind. No.

140
00:09:04,231 --> 00:09:05,389
She's in a Broadway show.

141
00:09:06,514 --> 00:09:08,689
Must have a lovely figure.

142
00:09:08,814 --> 00:09:11,189
Oh, she does. She does.

143
00:09:11,314 --> 00:09:13,773
Very lovely. She works for it though.

144
00:09:13,898 --> 00:09:15,956
Is there something wrong with working for it?

145
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:18,806
Well, sometimes I wish I weren't so acquainted with

146
00:09:18,931 --> 00:09:23,473
the care and maintenance of Sarah's figure.

147
00:09:23,598 --> 00:09:25,723
Takes some of the romance out of things.

148
00:09:25,848 --> 00:09:28,364
Right. You know what? I'll tell you something.

149
00:09:28,548 --> 00:09:31,598
Every woman has to work for it.

150
00:09:31,681 --> 00:09:33,431
The ones that claim to be "naturally thin"

151
00:09:33,514 --> 00:09:36,081
the ones that claim that they can eat everything they want to

152
00:09:36,206 --> 00:09:38,956
they are the ones working hardest of all.

153
00:09:39,081 --> 00:09:43,873
The illusion of effortlessness requires a great effort indeed.

154
00:09:45,081 --> 00:09:48,206
- Sarah. - Yeah, that's her name.

155
00:09:48,331 --> 00:09:52,289
Yeah, I know, you said. Pretty name.

156
00:09:52,414 --> 00:09:56,414
Almost like a poem in two syllables. Sarah.

157
00:09:56,539 --> 00:09:59,539
Sarah the dancer.

158
00:09:59,664 --> 00:10:01,123
I can almost picture her.

159
00:10:01,248 --> 00:10:03,164
Did your cardiologist have a name?

160
00:10:03,248 --> 00:10:04,914
Jeffrey. Jeff.

161
00:10:06,789 --> 00:10:11,064
Tell me. How old is, uhm,  Sarah the dancer?

162
00:10:11,248 --> 00:10:13,339
Oh, she's a... she's a college graduate.

163
00:10:13,364 --> 00:10:14,706
Her age?

164
00:10:14,789 --> 00:10:16,048
she's a recent college graduate.

165
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:17,223
Yeah, like 21?

166
00:10:17,348 --> 00:10:19,039
22.

167
00:10:19,164 --> 00:10:21,664
But She's 23 on August 12th.

168
00:10:21,748 --> 00:10:22,956
23 on August 12th.

169
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:24,331
Well, That's a very beautiful age.

170
00:10:24,414 --> 00:10:26,331
- Why did you wanna know? - You know I wanted to know.

171
00:10:26,414 --> 00:10:27,914
Maybe...

172
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:29,581
I wanted to know because...

173
00:10:29,706 --> 00:10:31,539
...I wanted to know. I wanted...

174
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:35,623
...to know if you were flirting with me.

175
00:10:35,748 --> 00:10:41,289
What does Sarah's age have to do with that?

176
00:10:41,414 --> 00:10:44,039
I am the same age as you. I think.

177
00:10:44,164 --> 00:10:50,081
And... well, a man my age who prefers 23 on August 12th

178
00:10:50,164 --> 00:10:53,789
might not flirt with someone who is...

179
00:10:53,914 --> 00:10:56,789
...well, let's just say 15 years past 23 on August 12th.

180
00:10:56,914 --> 00:11:00,331
That's an interesting theory.

181
00:11:00,414 --> 00:11:01,414
Yeah.

182
00:11:03,164 --> 00:11:06,123
What would Jeffrey the cardiologist think?

183
00:11:10,998 --> 00:11:12,706
Well, he hates it...

184
00:11:12,831 --> 00:11:15,081
...of course, he hates it,  but hey, you know what?

185
00:11:15,206 --> 00:11:17,498
He is in London and I love cigarettes.

186
00:11:17,581 --> 00:11:20,581
Don't let daddy find out.

187
00:11:20,664 --> 00:11:22,706
Who makes you think that Jeffrey is older?

188
00:11:22,789 --> 00:11:24,164
Is he?

189
00:11:24,248 --> 00:11:28,123
a little bit, I mean, he's 45.

190
00:11:28,248 --> 00:11:30,873
How might be being a doctor's wife?

191
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:33,664
A bit better than being a lawyer's wife.

192
00:11:33,748 --> 00:11:35,248
My first husband was a lawyer, you see...

193
00:11:35,331 --> 00:11:39,206
...so I have experienced both

194
00:11:39,289 --> 00:11:42,331
And what's the difference?

195
00:11:42,414 --> 00:11:47,373
The lawyer wore nicer suits.

196
00:11:53,881 --> 00:11:57,964
you know, I do remember you from before.

197
00:11:58,048 --> 00:11:59,131
- Really? - Yes.

198
00:11:59,214 --> 00:12:01,339
I even remember the first time I saw you.

199
00:12:01,423 --> 00:12:02,631
I was 19.

200
00:12:02,714 --> 00:12:03,714
You were the same.

201
00:12:03,714 --> 00:12:05,506
It was a barbecue in Cape Cod.

202
00:12:05,631 --> 00:12:08,798
And everyone else was in this long line for the buffet

203
00:12:08,881 --> 00:12:11,964
and you were lying under a tree

204
00:12:12,048 --> 00:12:13,631
reading a book.

205
00:12:13,714 --> 00:12:15,964
What was the book?

206
00:12:16,048 --> 00:12:18,006
It was something... do you know what it was?

207
00:12:18,089 --> 00:12:19,339
It was something by Jane Austen.

208
00:12:19,423 --> 00:12:21,014
- It was "Persuasion." - You're making it up.

209
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:22,798
- No, I'm not. - Yes, you are.

210
00:12:22,923 --> 00:12:24,589
I can tell by the tone of your voice.

211
00:12:24,714 --> 00:12:25,964
Why would you say that?

212
00:12:26,048 --> 00:12:27,256
People do it all the time, you know.

213
00:12:27,381 --> 00:12:29,298
Make up little details.

214
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:31,506
connect truths with half truths.

215
00:12:31,589 --> 00:12:32,673
It's story telling

216
00:12:32,756 --> 00:12:33,881
No, it is memory.

217
00:12:34,006 --> 00:12:35,423
You were wearing...

218
00:12:35,548 --> 00:12:39,756
I'll tell you, you were wearing one of those tube top thingies.

219
00:12:39,881 --> 00:12:42,339
No, true. It wouldn't be advisable on someone...

220
00:12:42,423 --> 00:12:44,006
...but on you...

221
00:12:44,089 --> 00:12:47,339
...let's just say that the effect was charming.

222
00:12:47,423 --> 00:12:49,131
You know what? I certainly remember that top...

223
00:12:49,214 --> 00:12:51,298
...and so it was not charming.

224
00:12:51,381 --> 00:12:53,423
- I thought it was. - So, you remember...

225
00:12:53,548 --> 00:12:55,464
...you remember the top...

226
00:12:55,548 --> 00:12:57,214
...but you don't remember the book.

227
00:12:57,339 --> 00:12:59,339
Well, I have an excellent memory

228
00:12:59,423 --> 00:13:01,339
for things what I want to remember.

229
00:13:01,423 --> 00:13:02,673
Really?

230
00:13:02,756 --> 00:13:04,798
People say that, and I used to agree.

231
00:13:04,881 --> 00:13:06,714
But, God, the older I get

232
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:11,214
the more I'm aware of the of the perversity of the human mind.

233
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:13,214
I mean I forget what I want to remember

234
00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:16,089
...and then... I just remember what's utterly useless.

235
00:13:16,114 --> 00:13:19,539
I walked up to you and, of coure you were incredibly annoyed with being interrupted.

236
00:13:19,623 --> 00:13:20,831
Whatever the book was

237
00:13:20,914 --> 00:13:22,539
you were totally absorbed in it.

238
00:13:22,623 --> 00:13:24,706
And I said: "I don't know if you know,

239
00:13:24,789 --> 00:13:26,039
...but the food is ready."

240
00:13:26,123 --> 00:13:29,081
And You looked up at the line passingly

241
00:13:29,164 --> 00:13:30,373
and you answered me

242
00:13:31,689 --> 00:13:33,239
You said:

243
00:13:33,323 --> 00:13:36,614
"The food will wait."

244
00:13:37,781 --> 00:13:39,031
I never said that.

245
00:13:39,114 --> 00:13:40,706
Yes, you did. You said: "The food will wait."

246
00:13:40,831 --> 00:13:42,514
And then you waved me away with your left hand

247
00:13:42,539 --> 00:13:43,781
like I was your servant.

248
00:13:43,881 --> 00:13:46,173
Not it won't.

249
00:13:46,256 --> 00:13:48,214
How come I never heard this history before?

250
00:13:48,339 --> 00:13:49,414
Because I never told it before.

251
00:13:49,514 --> 00:13:50,573
It's fiction, isn't it?

252
00:13:50,673 --> 00:13:52,139
it's based in truth, I assure you.

253
00:13:52,239 --> 00:13:53,531
Well that's interesting, but

254
00:13:53,614 --> 00:13:54,614
it doesn't help your argument

255
00:13:54,739 --> 00:13:56,781
because most fiction it is based in truth.

256
00:13:56,906 --> 00:13:57,906
clever.

257
00:13:57,948 --> 00:13:58,948
Yeah, I am clever.

258
00:13:59,489 --> 00:14:01,114
Ah, good.

259
00:14:01,239 --> 00:14:03,614
I knew I'd find you. You're the last two people.

260
00:14:04,539 --> 00:14:06,789
What, on the Earth?

261
00:14:06,914 --> 00:14:09,939
Right. Right. Funny.

262
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:11,581
No. You're the only two people...

263
00:14:11,706 --> 00:14:14,006
who haven't done your video testimonials.

264
00:14:14,831 --> 00:14:16,956
Testimonials to the bride and groom

265
00:14:17,081 --> 00:14:18,873
congratulating them for their choice naptuals

266
00:14:18,998 --> 00:14:20,414
and wishing them health and happiness

267
00:14:20,498 --> 00:14:22,414
and bla, bla, bla. Like that.

268
00:14:22,498 --> 00:14:26,081
But wouldn't it just be more hearfelt if we did it in person?

269
00:14:29,948 --> 00:14:32,073
This is for the wedding video.

270
00:14:32,198 --> 00:14:33,614
For posterity.

271
00:14:33,739 --> 00:14:36,573
Yeah, if it's for posterity

272
00:14:36,656 --> 00:14:38,323
...okay, how do I look?

273
00:14:39,114 --> 00:14:42,198
God! She looks great, man!

274
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:43,864
I'm sorry, it's just kind of a...

275
00:14:43,948 --> 00:14:46,406
Don't worry about him,  he's just trying to get laid.

276
00:14:51,889 --> 00:14:53,723
Susie! I'm,...

277
00:14:55,148 --> 00:14:56,314
...I'm certainly glad that I could be here...

278
00:14:56,439 --> 00:14:58,606
...to share your special day.

279
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,023
Could we go back, without the clap?

280
00:15:01,148 --> 00:15:02,356
- Okay. - Just don't clap.

281
00:15:02,481 --> 00:15:06,314
Don't c... Okay, All right then.

282
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:10,398
- Okay... ready? - Action!

283
00:15:10,523 --> 00:15:13,398
Susie! Well,...

284
00:15:13,481 --> 00:15:15,564
I'm certainly glad that I could be here to share...

285
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:17,439
...your special day.

286
00:15:17,564 --> 00:15:22,023
And although I haven't spent much time with Dave...

287
00:15:22,148 --> 00:15:24,273
Dan. Dan.

288
00:15:28,398 --> 00:15:30,606
Sorry. Yeah, right. I just...

289
00:15:32,564 --> 00:15:35,981
Although I haven't spent much time with Dan...

290
00:15:36,064 --> 00:15:39,606
...or even spoken to him for that matter...

291
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:40,964
...am, well,...

292
00:15:41,064 --> 00:15:46,773
...he certainly looked very nice in his tuxedo. Am, So...

293
00:15:46,898 --> 00:15:51,273
...so... I'm not angry that you didn't invite me...

294
00:15:51,398 --> 00:15:52,564
...until... you know - the last minute

295
00:15:52,648 --> 00:15:54,773
because, you know what? If you had...

296
00:15:54,898 --> 00:15:56,231
...I probably would've thought about it too much...

297
00:15:56,314 --> 00:15:57,606
...and wouldn't have come at all.

298
00:15:58,231 --> 00:16:01,148
So, what I'm essentially trying to say...

299
00:16:01,473 --> 00:16:04,723
...is... that I'm really glad that I could be here...

300
00:16:04,848 --> 00:16:06,723
...to share your and Dave's...

301
00:16:06,848 --> 00:16:07,889
- Dan! - I know! I knew it!

302
00:16:09,214 --> 00:16:11,964
Your and Dan's special day...

303
00:16:12,048 --> 00:16:13,756
...because... well, hey, a wedding comes

304
00:16:13,881 --> 00:16:15,173
only once in a lifetime, doesn't it?

305
00:16:15,256 --> 00:16:16,506
Or twice, in my case.

306
00:16:16,589 --> 00:16:18,048
But hopefully it's just once for You.

307
00:16:18,173 --> 00:16:19,256
Delete this down, will you?

308
00:16:19,381 --> 00:16:21,423
No, it was great. Really heartfelt.

309
00:16:24,056 --> 00:16:25,806
Okay.

310
00:16:26,431 --> 00:16:31,848
Ready? And... action.

311
00:16:31,973 --> 00:16:35,348
Congratulations, sis.

312
00:16:35,473 --> 00:16:36,514
That's how it should be done.

313
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:37,639
- That's it? - No, well...

314
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:40,306
...she took up a lot of time.

315
00:16:40,431 --> 00:16:41,681
Hey, sure it's sweet. I love it.

316
00:16:41,806 --> 00:16:44,389
I love it. Great. Have fun.

317
00:16:46,181 --> 00:16:50,473
Okay, am... camera note 201A.

318
00:16:50,556 --> 00:16:54,681
Pretty British or possibly Australian girl in the pink,

319
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:56,723
totally unusable.

320
00:16:56,848 --> 00:17:01,598
Blond guy... unusable,

321
00:17:01,681 --> 00:17:03,306
...but apparently the brother...

322
00:17:03,431 --> 00:17:07,639
so let's find a way to get him in.

323
00:17:07,764 --> 00:17:10,806
You relly don't like Dave, do you?

324
00:17:10,931 --> 00:17:12,514
- Dan. - Yeah, Whatever.

325
00:17:12,639 --> 00:17:14,181
You don't.

326
00:17:14,306 --> 00:17:15,389
No... well...I do like him, it's just that...

327
00:17:15,514 --> 00:17:16,598
Why do you ask me that?

328
00:17:16,681 --> 00:17:18,473
Well, because in the thing you just...

329
00:17:18,556 --> 00:17:21,639
...you only mentioned your sister.

330
00:17:21,723 --> 00:17:24,889
All right, I mean, I don't really...

331
00:17:25,014 --> 00:17:26,514
I don't know Dan. He's a...

332
00:17:26,639 --> 00:17:28,848
I mean if Susie's happy, than... I mean, look,

333
00:17:28,973 --> 00:17:30,681
I don't wanna talk about Susie and Dan.

334
00:17:30,806 --> 00:17:32,264
what does Dan do for living?

335
00:17:32,389 --> 00:17:34,014
He's a lawyer...

336
00:17:34,139 --> 00:17:37,181
...and... 'cause we're both in the same firm.

337
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:38,581
you can't object to that then.

338
00:17:38,606 --> 00:17:40,181
- Object to what? - His profession.

339
00:17:40,306 --> 00:17:42,473
Well, maybe I'm a self hating lawyer.

340
00:17:42,556 --> 00:17:43,598
Are you?

341
00:17:43,681 --> 00:17:46,014
Is there any other kind?

342
00:17:46,139 --> 00:17:47,973
You see, I introduced them.

343
00:17:48,056 --> 00:17:51,264
Yeah, I brought Susie to the company X-mas party.

344
00:17:51,348 --> 00:17:53,514
You brought your sister as a date?

345
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:56,514
Well...

346
00:17:56,639 --> 00:17:57,973
you think that's weird?

347
00:17:58,056 --> 00:18:00,348
No, it's just because when I go to company functions

348
00:18:00,473 --> 00:18:02,223
I like to have somebody that I can count on.

349
00:18:02,348 --> 00:18:04,181
Well, more like having a woman

350
00:18:04,306 --> 00:18:07,848
that you know that won't make a scene. More like.

351
00:18:07,973 --> 00:18:11,514
Look, I had just been divorced

352
00:18:11,639 --> 00:18:15,389
...and I wasn't dating anybody, so...

353
00:18:15,514 --> 00:18:18,306
Ah, what about 23 on August 12th?

354
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:20,598
Well, she was still in college.

355
00:18:20,681 --> 00:18:22,431
high school more like.

356
00:18:24,973 --> 00:18:26,139
Touch? Yes, I forgot.

357
00:18:26,223 --> 00:18:27,714
I don't wanna talk about Susie and Dan.

358
00:18:27,814 --> 00:18:29,856
we're not talking about them, We're talking about you.

359
00:18:29,981 --> 00:18:31,773
Everyone on the dance floor

360
00:18:31,856 --> 00:18:32,939
it's the last dance

361
00:18:33,023 --> 00:18:34,939
and then we're gonna call it a night.

362
00:18:35,023 --> 00:18:38,314
Congratulations, Susie and Dan.

363
00:18:40,956 --> 00:18:43,248
Do you dance?

364
00:18:45,789 --> 00:18:47,539
You know what?

365
00:18:47,623 --> 00:18:49,748
I find there isn't much of an occasion for it these days.

366
00:18:49,873 --> 00:18:52,289
I used to danced quite often...

367
00:18:52,414 --> 00:18:54,789
...before I... well, 20 or 25.

368
00:18:54,914 --> 00:18:57,873
but that was in a night club, or a party or something.

369
00:18:57,956 --> 00:19:01,498
But now that I am, well, older than 25...

370
00:19:01,581 --> 00:19:04,373
...I don't find there's an occasion for it.

371
00:19:04,456 --> 00:19:07,123
I just... I guess the dancing phase of my life is over.

372
00:19:07,248 --> 00:19:09,706
I'm afraid my skill atrophied.

373
00:19:09,789 --> 00:19:12,956
Maybe I should've been a little bit more clear.

374
00:19:13,081 --> 00:19:15,123
I meant would you dance with me.

375
00:19:15,248 --> 00:19:17,206
I knew what you meant. I was just stalling

376
00:19:17,331 --> 00:19:19,581
I didn't know what to answer.

377
00:19:22,748 --> 00:19:24,456
Well...

378
00:19:26,914 --> 00:19:28,623
come on. For old times sake.

379
00:19:28,748 --> 00:19:31,206
Old times were only good, If we hadn't let them go old.

380
00:19:31,289 --> 00:19:32,664
you'll regret it if you don't.

381
00:19:32,748 --> 00:19:33,956
- Will I? - Yes. I know you.

382
00:19:34,081 --> 00:19:37,831
You will think about it in the elevator to your room.

383
00:19:37,914 --> 00:19:41,456
You'll think about it when you're eating room service by yourself

384
00:19:41,548 --> 00:19:43,456
You'll think about it on your plane back home

385
00:19:43,581 --> 00:19:45,664
when you should be watching a ... movie

386
00:19:45,748 --> 00:19:47,039
You'll think about it 10 years from now

387
00:19:47,123 --> 00:19:48,239
when you least expect it

388
00:19:48,339 --> 00:19:50,173
Jeffrey the cardiologist will ask what's wrong

389
00:19:50,298 --> 00:19:51,581
...and you won't be able to answer.

390
00:19:51,681 --> 00:19:52,948
And he'll interpret this...

391
00:19:53,048 --> 00:19:54,339
...there's a growing coldness between us.

392
00:19:54,464 --> 00:19:55,881
And coldness transforms into separation...

393
00:19:55,964 --> 00:19:57,631
and before you know your marriage is over.

394
00:19:57,714 --> 00:19:58,714
And all this

395
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:00,714
because you wouldn't dance with me at this wedding.

396
00:20:00,998 --> 00:20:02,123
Okay.

397
00:20:02,448 --> 00:20:03,906
But I won't go on the dance floor.

398
00:20:04,031 --> 00:20:05,073
Fine.

399
00:20:05,156 --> 00:20:07,073
Dance floors are depressing at the end of the night.

400
00:20:07,156 --> 00:20:09,239
They feel like funeral.

401
00:20:09,323 --> 00:20:10,906
Hang on.

402
00:20:28,314 --> 00:20:30,689
Is this okay?

403
00:20:43,314 --> 00:20:45,439
I know how old you are, you know.

404
00:20:45,564 --> 00:20:46,773
I know.

405
00:20:46,856 --> 00:20:49,398
Then why always hesitate when you say your age?

406
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:50,689
I don't!

407
00:20:53,148 --> 00:20:56,939
Because it's getting to be a surprisingly large number

408
00:20:57,064 --> 00:21:01,106
...and I don't like how it sounds.

409
00:21:01,231 --> 00:21:02,856
When I say it sounds like a lie.

410
00:21:02,981 --> 00:21:04,189
I'm the same age as you.

411
00:21:04,314 --> 00:21:05,356
Oh, please!

412
00:21:05,481 --> 00:21:08,731
I shouldn't have to tell you that it's different for men.

413
00:21:08,814 --> 00:21:11,606
You call more attention to it when you don't say it bluntly.

414
00:21:11,731 --> 00:21:15,648
Mmm. Good advice.

415
00:21:15,731 --> 00:21:17,939
I'll remember that.

416
00:21:22,731 --> 00:21:26,564
So how did you meet your husband?

417
00:21:26,648 --> 00:21:31,356
After the divorce I moved from New York to London.

418
00:21:31,481 --> 00:21:33,314
You certainly wanted to get away.

419
00:21:33,439 --> 00:21:34,939
Yeah, my heart was broken.

420
00:21:35,064 --> 00:21:38,106
So you married a cardiologist.

421
00:21:38,231 --> 00:21:40,064
That's not good.

422
00:21:40,148 --> 00:21:41,356
You don't like my joke?

423
00:21:41,481 --> 00:21:43,439
Every woman that has ever married a cardiologist

424
00:21:43,523 --> 00:21:46,481
has had to have that joke ... for a moment.

425
00:21:46,564 --> 00:21:47,564
Okay.

426
00:21:49,439 --> 00:21:52,689
Sometimes I wish I'd married a gynecologist.

427
00:21:52,814 --> 00:21:56,106
I'm sure the jokes are much worse on the wives of gynecologists.

428
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:57,398
Not necessarily.

429
00:22:05,731 --> 00:22:10,689
So after the divorce you moved to London.

430
00:22:10,814 --> 00:22:14,106
After the divorce I moved to London...

431
00:22:14,189 --> 00:22:18,273
...and...

432
00:22:18,356 --> 00:22:19,814
...let's not talk about this.

433
00:22:19,898 --> 00:22:21,106
Why?

434
00:22:21,189 --> 00:22:23,273
Because...

435
00:22:24,006 --> 00:22:25,131
...if I talk about London...

436
00:22:25,214 --> 00:22:26,631
...then I'll talk about Jeffrey.

437
00:22:26,714 --> 00:22:28,381
And if I talk about Jeffrey...

438
00:22:28,506 --> 00:22:33,214
...then I'll feel too bad about what I know I'm going to do

439
00:22:33,339 --> 00:22:34,714
...and then I won't do it.

440
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:36,298
Yeah? What're you gonna do?

441
00:22:36,423 --> 00:22:37,506
Don't be clever.

442
00:22:37,589 --> 00:22:39,339
I don't like it when you're clever.

443
00:22:39,464 --> 00:22:41,881
God. Clever payed better 10 years ago...

444
00:22:42,006 --> 00:22:44,048
...when I had the youthful arrogance to go with it.

445
00:22:44,173 --> 00:22:45,714
Yeah, what pays well now?

446
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:49,048
Sincerity, when I can fake it.

447
00:22:49,173 --> 00:22:51,423
Wisdom would, if I had it.

448
00:23:07,714 --> 00:23:09,714
- Well, they all went... - I don't know.

449
00:23:12,806 --> 00:23:15,389
Could we have another drink, please?

450
00:23:22,514 --> 00:23:24,764
We're alone in the house!

451
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:29,014
For the longest time

452
00:23:29,139 --> 00:23:31,306
I used to think I saw you in the street.

453
00:23:31,431 --> 00:23:34,806
Up until last year even.

454
00:23:34,931 --> 00:23:37,389
And then turns out you are in London.

455
00:23:37,514 --> 00:23:39,139
And you've been there how long?

456
00:23:39,223 --> 00:23:40,223
Nine years.

457
00:23:40,306 --> 00:23:42,598
Nine years!

458
00:23:42,681 --> 00:23:44,681
nine years... A woman's about your hight

459
00:23:44,806 --> 00:23:47,973
...and about your hair colour and that weren't you.

460
00:23:48,056 --> 00:23:49,764
Nine years... a walker's gesture

461
00:23:49,848 --> 00:23:51,264
that suddenly sent me running down the street...

462
00:23:51,348 --> 00:23:53,556
... my heart racing...

463
00:23:57,181 --> 00:24:00,056
Somebody you once... thought you knew very well...

464
00:24:00,181 --> 00:24:03,014
can leave the country without you even knowing it.

465
00:24:03,139 --> 00:24:07,514
Of course. You don't know me very well.

466
00:24:07,598 --> 00:24:11,931
True. That is very true.

467
00:24:12,014 --> 00:24:13,889
you know, you're killing me.

468
00:24:14,014 --> 00:24:16,723
But it's true.

469
00:24:28,173 --> 00:24:30,223
And you are here how long?

470
00:24:31,048 --> 00:24:33,798
My plane leaves at 6.

471
00:24:33,881 --> 00:24:38,006
I guess I'll leave the hotel at 4.

472
00:24:38,131 --> 00:24:41,006
I was so last minute I could only stay a night.

473
00:24:42,923 --> 00:24:46,923
The curse on the seventh bridesmaid.

474
00:24:47,048 --> 00:24:48,289
I mean you should go to bed.

475
00:24:48,314 --> 00:24:51,089
You are right, I should.

476
00:24:51,214 --> 00:24:53,756
I'll probably just go upstrairs and watch TV.

477
00:24:55,339 --> 00:24:58,006
They want us to leave.

478
00:25:03,173 --> 00:25:05,173
Do you think?

479
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:09,673
Where shall we go?

480
00:25:09,798 --> 00:25:13,173
Well, I should go up to my room...

481
00:25:13,256 --> 00:25:17,589
...and you should go home to Sarah the dancer.

482
00:25:17,714 --> 00:25:20,464
Or we could stay here.

483
00:25:27,814 --> 00:25:29,256
Do you want to watch television with me?

484
00:25:29,381 --> 00:25:30,389
Do you think I should?

485
00:25:30,414 --> 00:25:32,006
I think you will anyway.

486
00:25:42,548 --> 00:25:43,548
Hang on.

487
00:25:43,589 --> 00:25:46,048
What?

488
00:25:46,473 --> 00:25:48,006
If we go in

489
00:25:48,089 --> 00:25:51,973
we're committing to a course of action.

490
00:25:52,098 --> 00:25:57,306
We're going into a 30 second elevator, all right?

491
00:25:57,431 --> 00:26:00,014
Let's just stand here a second.

492
00:26:05,598 --> 00:26:06,598
Hi...!

493
00:26:10,931 --> 00:26:13,639
What's everybody looking at?

494
00:26:15,348 --> 00:26:16,214
Oh, my God!

495
00:26:16,314 --> 00:26:19,064
I'm so tired...I didn't realize the elevator come here.

496
00:26:19,148 --> 00:26:20,148
Ah, you poor thing!

497
00:26:20,231 --> 00:26:21,231
Isn't that funny?

498
00:26:21,314 --> 00:26:25,273
Ah, you know Susie told me you came all the way from London, England.

499
00:26:30,898 --> 00:26:33,648
And you what were you waiting for?

500
00:26:33,773 --> 00:26:38,814
Ah, ladies first.

501
00:26:39,939 --> 00:26:42,856
Oh, you are so polite!

502
00:26:43,181 --> 00:26:45,056
Ladies first.

503
00:26:46,181 --> 00:26:49,889
And what floor are you going to?

504
00:26:50,014 --> 00:26:51,806
I don't know!

505
00:26:51,889 --> 00:26:52,889
God!

506
00:26:52,973 --> 00:26:56,473
Honestly, I don't remember.

507
00:26:56,598 --> 00:26:57,473
I'm 11.

508
00:26:58,556 --> 00:26:59,556
11.

509
00:26:59,556 --> 00:27:01,806
Okay.

510
00:27:02,931 --> 00:27:05,014
That's funny.

511
00:27:07,514 --> 00:27:08,889
Nice dress.

512
00:27:11,639 --> 00:27:13,723
Thanks. You look better in it actually.

513
00:27:13,848 --> 00:27:16,723
Ah well, you know...

514
00:27:22,973 --> 00:27:25,014
So... do you know each other, or...?

515
00:27:25,139 --> 00:27:27,389
- Yeah, we... - No.

516
00:27:27,489 --> 00:27:29,456
Well you do, or you don't?

517
00:27:29,556 --> 00:27:30,931
Oh, we used to.

518
00:27:31,014 --> 00:27:34,473
We used to. You know. In another life.

519
00:27:37,264 --> 00:27:38,306
Aha. How is Sarah doing?

520
00:27:38,431 --> 00:27:39,431
Good.

521
00:27:39,431 --> 00:27:40,848
- Yeah? - Yeah.

522
00:27:41,273 --> 00:27:42,273
good!

523
00:27:42,314 --> 00:27:43,481
Yeah.

524
00:27:43,806 --> 00:27:45,764
She wasn't here tonight, was she?

525
00:27:45,889 --> 00:27:46,889
I didn't...

526
00:27:48,639 --> 00:27:49,931
No?

527
00:27:50,014 --> 00:27:54,681
No. She ... She had to work.

528
00:27:54,806 --> 00:27:59,473
Ah, Dancing. Oh, God talent!

529
00:27:59,998 --> 00:28:01,939
She is so beautiful.

530
00:28:02,748 --> 00:28:04,706
Amazing. Amazing.

531
00:28:04,831 --> 00:28:06,581
And so...

532
00:28:07,106 --> 00:28:08,706
Skinny?

533
00:28:08,831 --> 00:28:10,331
And flexible.

534
00:28:10,414 --> 00:28:12,456
Skinny and flexible. I just... God...

535
00:28:12,581 --> 00:28:14,706
...I would murder someone for her body.

536
00:28:14,789 --> 00:28:21,081
I just... there is no-one hotter in the world than Sarah.

537
00:28:29,156 --> 00:28:31,031
Give Sarah my best if you remember.

538
00:28:31,114 --> 00:28:32,114
Good night.

539
00:28:32,114 --> 00:28:33,114
Okay.

540
00:28:33,698 --> 00:28:35,906
- Bye. - Bye.

541
00:28:37,939 --> 00:28:40,398
Will that cause much trouble for you?

542
00:28:43,989 --> 00:28:46,739
I don't even know what to say.

543
00:28:48,323 --> 00:28:49,781
I mean£¬whateve. It doesn't really matter.

544
00:28:52,239 --> 00:28:56,031
God, people should... mind their own business.

545
00:29:02,489 --> 00:29:04,364
Is that Sarah the dancer?

546
00:29:04,448 --> 00:29:06,531
People should mind their own business.

547
00:29:09,948 --> 00:29:11,031
That woman

548
00:29:11,114 --> 00:29:13,573
That woman is meaningless.

549
00:29:13,656 --> 00:29:15,406
She makes everything consequential.

550
00:29:15,489 --> 00:29:17,448
What do you mean consequential?

551
00:29:18,573 --> 00:29:21,823
You know. As though there'll be consequences.

552
00:29:21,948 --> 00:29:25,073
What woman?

553
00:29:25,198 --> 00:29:27,948
The woman? you know? in the bridesmaid's dress.

554
00:29:28,073 --> 00:29:29,573
What woman in the bridesmaid's dress?

555
00:29:29,698 --> 00:29:32,156
The woman in the elevator.

556
00:29:32,281 --> 00:29:33,431
There wasn't a woman in the elevator.

557
00:29:33,515 --> 00:29:35,865
I don't remember the woman in the elevator.

558
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:37,615
There wasn't a woman in the elevator.

559
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:40,115
I didn't see a woman in elevator.

560
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,606
I mean...

561
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,065
What about Sarah?

562
00:29:47,148 --> 00:29:48,190
Never heard of her.

563
00:29:48,273 --> 00:29:49,273
Your girlfriend.

564
00:29:49,356 --> 00:29:50,523
I don't have girlfriend.

565
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:54,190
And Jeffrey?

566
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:55,190
Who?

567
00:29:55,273 --> 00:29:56,565
My husband.

568
00:29:56,648 --> 00:29:57,898
Never met him either.

569
00:29:58,023 --> 00:30:00,273
I have.

570
00:30:00,898 --> 00:30:04,398
You're not feeling well, are you?

571
00:30:04,523 --> 00:30:08,231
I should take you straight to bed.

572
00:30:08,356 --> 00:30:09,856
Which way is it, by the way?

573
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:11,356
It's this over here.

574
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,231
Here's the key.

575
00:30:31,065 --> 00:30:32,856
You have a message.

576
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:37,356
I do.

577
00:30:39,906 --> 00:30:41,865
Won't you check it?

578
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:46,031
No. I already know who it is and know what he's saying.

579
00:30:46,115 --> 00:30:47,906
So it's a he.

580
00:30:48,031 --> 00:30:51,490
Of course it's a he. He's my husband.

581
00:30:53,615 --> 00:30:55,240
But what does he want?

582
00:30:55,365 --> 00:30:57,531
Well, he wants to know how I am.

583
00:30:57,656 --> 00:30:59,865
He wants to know... you know...

584
00:30:59,948 --> 00:31:01,990
...if I enjoyed myself at the wedding.

585
00:31:02,073 --> 00:31:03,073
He wants to know...

586
00:31:03,156 --> 00:31:05,156
...if I remembered to please a wake-up call.

587
00:31:05,281 --> 00:31:08,823
He wants to.. you know - tell me the minutiaes of his life

588
00:31:08,906 --> 00:31:10,031
and hear mine in return.

589
00:31:10,115 --> 00:31:12,490
This is what husbands and the wives do, you know.

590
00:31:12,573 --> 00:31:14,198
No. He wants to check up on you.

591
00:31:16,023 --> 00:31:17,148
No. He trusts me.

592
00:31:17,273 --> 00:31:18,731
You know what? I'm very reliable.

593
00:31:18,856 --> 00:31:20,340
Yeah? You never used to be.

594
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,231
Get out!

595
00:31:23,873 --> 00:31:26,331
You know what? That it's enough to say that

596
00:31:26,456 --> 00:31:29,081
there are lots of things that I used to be

597
00:31:29,206 --> 00:31:30,540
that I am no longer.

598
00:31:30,665 --> 00:31:35,498
And there are lots of things that I'd never thought I'd be that I unexpectedly am.

599
00:31:49,615 --> 00:31:51,031
Well,

600
00:31:51,115 --> 00:31:52,281
What?

601
00:31:52,406 --> 00:31:53,615
I'm here.

602
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:57,473
Yes. So you are.

603
00:31:57,573 --> 00:31:59,240
What now?

604
00:31:59,365 --> 00:32:01,198
I don't know.

605
00:32:01,281 --> 00:32:02,948
I wonder...

606
00:32:03,073 --> 00:32:07,673
I wonder what two lonely people in a hotel room do when no-one's watching?

607
00:32:07,756 --> 00:32:10,398
What makes you think that I'm lonely?

608
00:32:10,498 --> 00:32:12,956
23 August 12th.

609
00:32:13,081 --> 00:32:15,265
I'm not lonely.

610
00:32:15,348 --> 00:32:16,831
I don't believe you.

611
00:32:16,915 --> 00:32:18,165
you are lonely too.

612
00:32:18,248 --> 00:32:21,873
Everyone is lonely.

613
00:32:21,998 --> 00:32:24,831
Of course I'm lonely.

614
00:32:24,956 --> 00:32:28,248
One day I woke up in a strange country...

615
00:32:28,373 --> 00:32:31,040
...surrounded by strangers.

616
00:32:31,165 --> 00:32:34,456
You didn't have to go.

617
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,898
I wanted to be alone.

618
00:32:37,523 --> 00:32:39,898
Why are you here?

619
00:32:42,523 --> 00:32:43,940
To fuck you.

620
00:32:44,065 --> 00:32:45,273
To fuck me?

621
00:32:45,398 --> 00:32:49,565
Yeah. And then to go home...

622
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:50,690
That's all right.

623
00:32:50,773 --> 00:32:53,856
Fuck me and...

624
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:57,190
And to be the 7th bridesmaid at my sister's wedding.

625
00:32:57,273 --> 00:32:59,398
Yeah, and that too.

626
00:32:59,481 --> 00:33:01,565
Yep.

627
00:33:01,648 --> 00:33:04,273
Christ, what would Susie think?

628
00:33:04,398 --> 00:33:07,481
Susie? She's a sweet girl.

629
00:33:07,606 --> 00:33:10,773
She doesn't think of anyone but herself.

630
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:20,423
You might as well strip then.

631
00:33:21,606 --> 00:33:23,156
Excuse me?

632
00:33:23,256 --> 00:33:24,556
Take clothes off.

633
00:33:24,556 --> 00:33:25,556
Ah, yeah?

634
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:28,515
Yeah. So I can get a good look at you.

635
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,140
I like to see what I'm getting into.

636
00:33:31,265 --> 00:33:32,765
All right.

637
00:33:49,473 --> 00:33:51,473
What?

638
00:33:58,556 --> 00:34:01,431
Oh, my God, you are fat.

639
00:34:01,556 --> 00:34:02,556
I'm sorry.

640
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:06,573
- I am not! - Yes, you are. You're far fatter than you used to be.

641
00:34:06,656 --> 00:34:08,865
And you are far crueller than used to be.

642
00:34:08,948 --> 00:34:11,073
- I'm s... I didn't mean it... - Am I fat?

643
00:34:11,198 --> 00:34:12,698
I didn't mean it in a bad way.

644
00:34:12,823 --> 00:34:13,823
It was an observation.

645
00:34:13,906 --> 00:34:16,531
If it was woman, we wouldn't be having sex right now.

646
00:34:16,615 --> 00:34:17,615
I'm sorry.

647
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:18,781
Come on.

648
00:34:18,906 --> 00:34:21,398
How much did you put on£¬Like 15 pounds (=7 kilos)?

649
00:34:21,623 --> 00:34:22,623
15 pounds?

650
00:34:22,665 --> 00:34:25,706
you see? Not you are exactly obese.

651
00:34:25,831 --> 00:34:27,165
I wouldn't even call you portly.

652
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:28,873
Ah, thank you.

653
00:34:28,998 --> 00:34:30,831
I'm sorry. Come here.

654
00:34:30,915 --> 00:34:33,498
It was just something... it was just different.

655
00:34:33,581 --> 00:34:35,706
I didn't expect it.

656
00:34:35,831 --> 00:34:37,040
You used to be so thin.

657
00:34:37,165 --> 00:34:38,540
I mean you were insubstantial, really.

658
00:34:38,865 --> 00:34:41,698
God, the complements keep coming.

659
00:34:41,823 --> 00:34:43,573
Yeah, but now...

660
00:34:43,698 --> 00:34:44,698
Now, you know what? Look at it this way.

661
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:46,198
There's a grandness to you.

662
00:34:46,281 --> 00:34:48,281
Like, you know, the rings in a tree trunk

663
00:34:48,406 --> 00:34:50,240
asserting the passage of the time:

664
00:34:50,365 --> 00:34:51,823
Like "I have earned the right

665
00:34:51,948 --> 00:34:54,990
to fill up more space in the one universe."

666
00:34:55,073 --> 00:34:56,990
That's bullshit.

667
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,206
I tried.

668
00:35:05,623 --> 00:35:08,873
Sarah keeps trying to give me a diet.

669
00:35:08,998 --> 00:35:13,665
Sit down. Relax, 'tree trunk?

670
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:14,831
God.

671
00:35:14,956 --> 00:35:18,373
What does 23 on August 12th know about life?

672
00:35:21,248 --> 00:35:24,540
You know, it is funny, because I feel like...

673
00:35:24,665 --> 00:35:26,831
...you're a little boy and I'm an older woman.

674
00:35:26,915 --> 00:35:28,373
We're exactly the same age.

675
00:35:28,498 --> 00:35:29,915
Yes, but somehow...

676
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,748
...I feel like so much older than you.

677
00:35:32,873 --> 00:35:35,290
How much do you think that is?

678
00:35:47,948 --> 00:35:51,531
God, I wonder why we're doing this.

679
00:35:51,615 --> 00:35:54,198
This didn't help anything before, did it?

680
00:35:54,281 --> 00:35:58,781
And this so not gonna help anyithing.

681
00:35:58,906 --> 00:36:02,698
God, you put that champagne in front of me.

682
00:36:02,781 --> 00:36:05,406
I knew it going to happen.

683
00:36:06,131 --> 00:36:09,465
I looked at that glass and I thought:

684
00:36:09,548 --> 00:36:13,965
"Fuck. Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck."

685
00:36:14,548 --> 00:36:16,048
No, it's not funny.

686
00:36:16,173 --> 00:36:18,590
I am married to a well-respected cardiologist...

687
00:36:18,673 --> 00:36:20,631
...and I so try to do the right thing...

688
00:36:20,715 --> 00:36:22,715
...but there is... there's something about you...

689
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:27,465
...it sends me... in the opposite direction.

690
00:36:28,965 --> 00:36:32,381
And it's not gonna turn out well.

691
00:36:32,506 --> 00:36:36,340
There are no happy endings in our future.

692
00:36:36,465 --> 00:36:40,840
I know that.

693
00:36:40,965 --> 00:36:43,548
Do you?

694
00:36:43,673 --> 00:36:46,048
I knew.

695
00:36:48,006 --> 00:36:49,131
Okay.

696
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:53,131
Dress off.

697
00:37:26,123 --> 00:37:27,915
need help?

698
00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:32,040
With that top.

699
00:37:53,823 --> 00:37:57,365
What would you have done without me?

700
00:37:57,490 --> 00:37:59,073
Stuggled.

701
00:38:00,823 --> 00:38:03,115
You might've been stuck in that bridesmaid's dress

702
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,823
for the rest of your life.

703
00:38:04,906 --> 00:38:06,865
At least until I've got back to London.

704
00:38:06,948 --> 00:38:10,073
London. Should I call you if I were there?

705
00:38:10,198 --> 00:38:12,198
No. No way.

706
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:17,948
You wouldn't recognize me, anyway.

707
00:38:36,365 --> 00:38:39,031
I want you to listen to me.

708
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:43,115
After.

709
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:47,240
No. Now. A woman never has a man's focus

710
00:38:47,365 --> 00:38:48,823
...as much as she does before the sex.

711
00:38:48,906 --> 00:38:51,906
Come on.

712
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:53,865
Speak up.

713
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,615
You can't carry on living like this.

714
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:01,073
And?

715
00:39:05,823 --> 00:39:07,823
That's it.

716
00:39:07,906 --> 00:39:09,573
That's all I wanted to say.

717
00:39:09,698 --> 00:39:11,156
Okay.

718
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:14,240
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

719
00:39:53,698 --> 00:39:55,156
What's this?

720
00:39:55,281 --> 00:39:56,281
It's a scar.

721
00:39:56,323 --> 00:39:57,023
Is it new?

722
00:39:57,065 --> 00:39:58,065
Not so new.

723
00:39:58,065 --> 00:40:00,240
It's new to me.

724
00:40:00,365 --> 00:40:01,990
Ah, how did you get it?

725
00:40:02,073 --> 00:40:04,281
I was riding my bike.

726
00:40:04,406 --> 00:40:05,365
you still race?

727
00:40:05,406 --> 00:40:07,240
No, it wasn't a race.

728
00:40:07,365 --> 00:40:10,190
I was riding my bike and was hit by a car.

729
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:12,206
No!

730
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:14,998
My poor thing.

731
00:40:15,098 --> 00:40:17,223
Was it serious?

732
00:40:21,765 --> 00:40:25,573
I was in hospital for six months.

733
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:28,798
you shouldn't have been alone.

734
00:40:28,881 --> 00:40:30,131
I wanted to be alone.

735
00:40:30,215 --> 00:40:32,423
Why didn't you call me?

736
00:40:32,506 --> 00:40:34,673
- I thought about it. - But you didn't.

737
00:40:34,798 --> 00:40:37,173
I guess not.

738
00:40:37,298 --> 00:40:38,590
I would've come.

739
00:40:38,673 --> 00:40:41,256
I know.

740
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:44,423
I like knowing that.

741
00:40:44,506 --> 00:40:48,873
You go away for so long and you come back to me damaged.

742
00:40:48,973 --> 00:40:52,890
I'm sorry.

743
00:40:52,973 --> 00:40:56,348
All this land was once mine.

744
00:40:56,473 --> 00:40:57,473
Yep.

745
00:40:57,473 --> 00:40:59,181
Now it belongs to someone else.

746
00:40:59,306 --> 00:41:02,556
Yep.

747
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,931
It's like when you drive by your childhood home

748
00:41:05,015 --> 00:41:08,056
and find another family living there.

749
00:41:08,181 --> 00:41:09,631
Well, come here!

750
00:41:09,731 --> 00:41:11,815
If I told you that I love you

751
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:12,940
that I've always loved you

752
00:41:13,065 --> 00:41:14,731
that I loved you to distraction

753
00:41:14,856 --> 00:41:15,898
...would you leave him?

754
00:41:16,523 --> 00:41:18,356
No.

755
00:42:57,131 --> 00:42:59,298
What are you thinking?

756
00:42:59,381 --> 00:43:04,381
That it's probably a mistake.

757
00:43:04,548 --> 00:43:08,798
Are you already thinking that?

758
00:43:09,123 --> 00:43:14,748
you shouldn't think that until at least 20 minutes after we're done.

759
00:43:14,873 --> 00:43:16,873
And what are you thinking?

760
00:43:20,415 --> 00:43:27,498
I'm thinking about that girl I used to know lying under a tree

761
00:43:27,623 --> 00:43:29,956
- Don't think about her. - ... reading a book. Why?

762
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:31,631
I can't compete with her.

763
00:43:31,756 --> 00:43:34,215
you don't have to compete with her.

764
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:35,923
Liar.

765
00:43:36,106 --> 00:43:37,481
You don't have to do this.

766
00:43:37,606 --> 00:43:39,481
As if the act in itself mattered.

767
00:43:39,606 --> 00:43:42,190
it does matter.

768
00:43:42,273 --> 00:43:44,973
It's technicality.

769
00:43:48,481 --> 00:43:51,148
Don't you know what we've already done?

770
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:16,331
Your skin is different from I remember.

771
00:46:16,415 --> 00:46:20,040
The texture is different.

772
00:46:20,165 --> 00:46:22,956
How? Rougher?

773
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,831
No, not rougher.

774
00:46:25,915 --> 00:46:30,665
It's more papery that it used to be.

775
00:46:30,790 --> 00:46:32,373
You sweat more.

776
00:46:33,998 --> 00:46:35,665
And you smell.

777
00:46:35,748 --> 00:46:36,998
Thanks.

778
00:46:37,123 --> 00:46:39,123
And you're fat.

779
00:46:45,165 --> 00:46:47,248
Your hair is shorter.

780
00:46:47,373 --> 00:46:49,415
Yeah?

781
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:53,331
I liked it long.

782
00:46:53,456 --> 00:46:55,665
Ah, I bet Sarah the dancer has long hair.

783
00:46:55,748 --> 00:46:57,123
No.

784
00:46:57,206 --> 00:46:59,040
I bet she does.

785
00:46:59,165 --> 00:47:00,456
Show me a photo.

786
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:02,081
I don't have one with me.

787
00:47:02,206 --> 00:47:03,665
Well, send it to me then.

788
00:47:03,748 --> 00:47:08,081
I don't know your address.

789
00:47:08,206 --> 00:47:12,540
If you don't have a photo of Sarah the dancer on you

790
00:47:12,665 --> 00:47:16,248
it means that you... you don't love her.

791
00:47:16,373 --> 00:47:17,873
I know what she looks like

792
00:47:17,998 --> 00:47:19,206
why do I need a picture?

793
00:47:19,331 --> 00:47:21,206
To show other people.

794
00:47:24,281 --> 00:47:26,198
Where are you going?

795
00:47:26,323 --> 00:47:27,448
To the bathroom.

796
00:47:27,574 --> 00:47:28,573
Is that all right?

797
00:47:28,573 --> 00:47:29,990
Can I come?

798
00:47:30,073 --> 00:47:31,573
No.

799
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,031
You have one new message.

800
00:48:46,115 --> 00:48:47,156
Press 1 to listen.

801
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:49,573
Message received 2:31 p.m.

802
00:48:49,698 --> 00:48:50,698
Hello, gorgeous girl.

803
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:51,823
sorry we missed you.

804
00:48:51,906 --> 00:48:53,365
Everyone's fine.

805
00:48:53,448 --> 00:48:55,656
Elsie wanted to say something to you before bed.

806
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:58,823
Hi. Remember to get me the snowboard. Okay, mommy?

807
00:48:58,823 --> 00:49:00,823
And something for me too, but it doesn't matter what.

808
00:49:00,906 --> 00:49:03,031
How magnanimous for you, Gwennie.

809
00:49:03,156 --> 00:49:04,531
We'll try to call you in the morning.

810
00:49:04,656 --> 00:49:07,031
Make sure you take a photo in that bridesmade's dress

811
00:49:07,156 --> 00:49:08,365
that's for me, by the way.

812
00:49:08,448 --> 00:49:09,906
I love you. Everybody saids they love you.

813
00:49:10,031 --> 00:49:11,031
We love you!

814
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:12,073
Come soon. Bye-bye!

815
00:49:12,198 --> 00:49:13,198
I love you.

816
00:49:13,198 --> 00:49:14,198
Call early if you want.

817
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:15,490
I'm going to take a run

818
00:49:15,573 --> 00:49:16,948
End of the message.

819
00:49:17,073 --> 00:49:19,031
Message deleted.

820
00:49:35,690 --> 00:49:39,898
Hi. Hi, babe, it's me. I didn't wake you, did I?

821
00:49:41,023 --> 00:49:46,731
No.  Ah, it was... it was dull. Boring, boring, nothing

822
00:49:46,773 --> 00:49:49,273
Nothing much happened.

823
00:49:49,398 --> 00:49:51,148
I missed you. Yeah.

824
00:49:51,273 --> 00:49:53,231
Do you mind if I use the phone?

825
00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:57,856
It's fine!

826
00:49:57,940 --> 00:50:00,398
Could you leave that by the door?

827
00:50:03,315 --> 00:50:04,773
I'm sorry.

828
00:50:04,898 --> 00:50:06,898
Didn't know you were on the phone.

829
00:50:10,906 --> 00:50:15,031
Hm? Right. Ah, it was just room service.

830
00:50:15,115 --> 00:50:16,656
Yeah, I know I shouldn't eat this late

831
00:50:16,781 --> 00:50:20,531
but the food on the... plane was horrible

832
00:50:20,656 --> 00:50:23,490
and the food at the wedding was really, really horrible.

833
00:50:23,573 --> 00:50:27,531
Hm? Tip? Oh, tip! Of course, thank you.

834
00:50:27,656 --> 00:50:34,656
Ah, God, I'm so gone. Just gone.

835
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:36,198
One second.

836
00:50:41,606 --> 00:50:43,023
Have a good night.

837
00:50:43,106 --> 00:50:44,690
Ah, thank you very much mamm

838
00:50:44,773 --> 00:50:46,690
It's very generous of you. You look very nice tonight

839
00:50:46,773 --> 00:50:48,065
Enjoy your stay

840
00:50:50,073 --> 00:50:54,656
Hi. Yeah, the waiter was very friendly.

841
00:50:54,740 --> 00:51:01,073
I'm having...  you know... French fries

842
00:51:01,198 --> 00:51:02,448
French onion soup,

843
00:51:02,573 --> 00:51:07,656
And, um, French toast, I think. And a pickle! Hm?

844
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:11,656
Yeah, it's all very French except for the pickle.

845
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:17,273
I'm still thinking about it.

846
00:51:17,398 --> 00:51:19,898
No, I'm still thinking.

847
00:51:20,023 --> 00:51:25,315
Yeah. Um, okay, okay.

848
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:28,565
Well, can I...? I'll phone you before I get on the plane.

849
00:51:28,648 --> 00:51:30,981
All right. Yeah, I love you too.

850
00:51:31,106 --> 00:51:34,398
Okay. ... Bye.

851
00:51:44,398 --> 00:51:46,481
I didn't know you were on the phone.

852
00:51:46,606 --> 00:51:48,398
I saw your feet under the door.

853
00:51:50,606 --> 00:51:51,898
Well, you recovered well.

854
00:51:51,981 --> 00:51:53,523
Anyway, it was good.

855
00:51:55,606 --> 00:51:59,356
It's quite easy to lie once you get started.

856
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:03,190
Well, sorry.

857
00:52:03,273 --> 00:52:07,523
You could've put me in a really awkward situation.

858
00:52:07,606 --> 00:52:11,398
I knew you'd be ingenious and you were it.

859
00:52:11,523 --> 00:52:14,398
Yeah, but what was the point?

860
00:52:14,481 --> 00:52:15,731
To see you scorn.

861
00:52:16,156 --> 00:52:18,531
That's not very nice.

862
00:52:18,615 --> 00:52:20,740
I wanted him to know I existed.

863
00:52:20,865 --> 00:52:22,406
Him?

864
00:52:22,531 --> 00:52:24,198
Jeffrey, the cardiologist.

865
00:52:24,281 --> 00:52:25,698
Look, he knows you exist.

866
00:52:25,781 --> 00:52:27,073
How wouldn't he know it?

867
00:52:27,198 --> 00:52:28,656
You don't have any secrets?

868
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:30,823
No. Nothing significant. No.

869
00:52:30,906 --> 00:52:33,615
So you will tell him you made love to me tonight?

870
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:35,073
Maybe, some day.

871
00:52:35,198 --> 00:52:38,031
Somehow, I doubt that.

872
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:41,906
Jeffrey. Jeffrey the cardiologist.

873
00:52:42,031 --> 00:52:44,781
Hallo, Jeffrey?

874
00:52:45,506 --> 00:52:46,715
- Shall I call him? - No.

875
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:49,256
Shall I call and tell him what you just did?

876
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:50,423
No!

877
00:52:50,548 --> 00:52:52,298
Would that spoil things between you?

878
00:52:52,381 --> 00:52:54,381
It might.

879
00:52:55,415 --> 00:52:56,748
Why would you wanna do that?

880
00:52:56,873 --> 00:52:59,623
Would it ruin things so much that you couldn't go back to London?

881
00:52:59,706 --> 00:53:00,998
No. Not that much...

882
00:53:01,081 --> 00:53:03,540
...because I have a job there, and a dog, and a home.

883
00:53:03,665 --> 00:53:05,290
- And a husband. - And a husband.

884
00:53:05,373 --> 00:53:07,540
Hello, Jeffrey? The cardiologist?

885
00:53:07,865 --> 00:53:09,531
Yes. I'd like to make an appointment.

886
00:53:09,656 --> 00:53:12,531
My heart's been broken.

887
00:53:12,656 --> 00:53:15,823
Now, you wanna play that game.

888
00:53:16,306 --> 00:53:18,098
Now, I get to phone Sarah the dancer.

889
00:53:18,223 --> 00:53:21,140
Go ahead.

890
00:53:21,265 --> 00:53:22,265
You don't care?

891
00:53:22,306 --> 00:53:24,181
No, not really.

892
00:53:24,306 --> 00:53:25,265
That's awful.

893
00:53:25,306 --> 00:53:26,848
Well, it is was it is.

894
00:53:26,973 --> 00:53:29,515
I hate that phrase.

895
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:31,806
sounds like dying.

896
00:53:34,723 --> 00:53:37,473
What was your ex-husband like?

897
00:53:37,598 --> 00:53:39,306
You know perfectly well what he was like.

898
00:53:39,431 --> 00:53:40,931
Refresh my memory.

899
00:53:41,056 --> 00:53:43,223
No.

900
00:53:43,306 --> 00:53:46,015
Honest, I can't remember.

901
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:49,056
The memory starts to go around 40, you know.

902
00:53:56,381 --> 00:54:00,798
He was red, he was kind of yellow.

903
00:54:00,881 --> 00:54:03,631
And black, pink, orange and blue.

904
00:54:05,131 --> 00:54:09,365
Magenta, indigo. A little ocher. and Turquoise.

905
00:54:09,465 --> 00:54:11,923
Hey! What does that mean?

906
00:54:12,006 --> 00:54:15,298
I don't know, it's what I see you when I close my eyes.

907
00:54:15,381 --> 00:54:19,548
Come on! That's a bullshit answer.

908
00:54:29,048 --> 00:54:31,340
Ask nicely.

909
00:54:43,556 --> 00:54:45,515
I loved him.

910
00:54:46,556 --> 00:54:49,848
I loved him...

911
00:54:49,973 --> 00:54:54,390
...but sometimes people who really love each other

912
00:54:54,473 --> 00:54:58,098
Well, they have the uncanny knack

913
00:54:58,223 --> 00:55:01,431
for making each other miserable.

914
00:55:01,556 --> 00:55:03,431
And now?

915
00:55:03,556 --> 00:55:06,515
And now I'm happy. I'm happy.

916
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:08,265
Of course I'm happy.

917
00:55:08,348 --> 00:55:10,265
Of course I'm happy.

918
00:55:10,348 --> 00:55:13,973
Yeah, I am.

919
00:55:14,098 --> 00:55:17,473
Sometimes I long for a little misery, though.

920
00:55:17,598 --> 00:55:21,181
It can be terribly romantic.

921
00:55:21,265 --> 00:55:24,290
My ex-husband made me deliriously miserable.

922
00:55:24,473 --> 00:55:26,956
You're too kind.

923
00:55:27,056 --> 00:55:32,223
Not at all. It's the truth.

924
00:55:32,306 --> 00:55:34,931
Do you wantna know what my wife was like?

925
00:55:35,015 --> 00:55:36,306
Your ex-wife, you mean?

926
00:55:36,431 --> 00:55:38,223
Yes, my ex-wife. Do you wanna know?

927
00:55:38,306 --> 00:55:42,098
No. I have no interest in other women.

928
00:55:42,223 --> 00:55:44,431
She was a great fuck.

929
00:55:44,556 --> 00:55:45,806
Wow.

930
00:55:45,931 --> 00:55:51,223
She was a great fuck. And a great friend.

931
00:56:17,573 --> 00:56:19,656
You know, I have to confess...

932
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:21,573
...I...

933
00:56:21,698 --> 00:56:24,031
...I checked the message.

934
00:56:26,906 --> 00:56:28,823
You know he called, but you couldn't be bothered.

935
00:56:28,906 --> 00:56:30,115
remember the blinking red light?

936
00:56:31,740 --> 00:56:35,240
In fact it's really annoying during sex.

937
00:56:35,365 --> 00:56:38,573
Why?

938
00:56:38,698 --> 00:56:42,656
I just wanted to know what he sounded like.

939
00:56:42,781 --> 00:56:45,365
What did he sound like?

940
00:56:45,490 --> 00:56:49,948
Like Elvis Costello.

941
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:52,031
I've never really thought about it.

942
00:56:52,115 --> 00:56:53,156
Maybe a little.

943
00:56:53,281 --> 00:56:56,865
Foreign, cool.

944
00:56:56,990 --> 00:56:57,990
I hated him immediately.

945
00:56:58,115 --> 00:56:59,615
Why would you like him?

946
00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:01,656
I hated it with a passion

947
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:03,698
that I didn't know I was capable any more.

948
00:57:03,823 --> 00:57:04,990
For my sake?

949
00:57:05,073 --> 00:57:06,156
Yes, for your sake.

950
00:57:06,281 --> 00:57:08,490
Of course for your sake, silly little girl.

951
00:57:08,573 --> 00:57:13,281
I'm not a little girl any more.

952
00:57:13,365 --> 00:57:15,656
Don't you wanna know what his message said?

953
00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:17,323
No.

954
00:57:17,448 --> 00:57:23,615
It said that he loves you and misses you.

955
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:26,781
He wants you to call you before you leave.

956
00:57:26,906 --> 00:57:31,031
He's going for a jog.

957
00:57:31,115 --> 00:57:35,156
He'll be up early, so don't be afraid to call.

958
00:57:35,281 --> 00:57:36,281
Thank you.

959
00:57:36,365 --> 00:57:38,531
Yeah.

960
00:57:38,656 --> 00:57:42,990
I mean... To tell you the truth...I...

961
00:57:43,073 --> 00:57:45,531
...well, I just expected more.

962
00:57:45,656 --> 00:57:47,365
A soliloquy from "Hamlet?"

963
00:57:47,448 --> 00:57:49,990
No, but he was just all so ordinary.

964
00:57:50,115 --> 00:57:53,698
I mean, the man that marries you should be extraordinary.

965
00:57:53,823 --> 00:57:55,323
Extraordinary.

966
00:58:00,573 --> 00:58:03,531
God, I'm done with extraordinary?

967
00:58:03,656 --> 00:58:05,073
I'm too old for extraordinary?

968
00:58:05,198 --> 00:58:06,615
And how old would that be?

969
00:58:06,740 --> 00:58:09,448
been too straight for extraordinary for some time now.

970
00:58:09,531 --> 00:58:12,490
And that's my fault I suppose?

971
00:58:12,573 --> 00:58:15,031
God, you'd love to think that, wouldn't you?

972
00:58:15,115 --> 00:58:16,490
You'd love to imagine...

973
00:58:16,573 --> 00:58:19,031
...that you ruined me for all the other men.

974
00:58:19,115 --> 00:58:20,615
Would you amuse me in something?

975
00:58:20,740 --> 00:58:21,698
Probably.

976
00:58:21,781 --> 00:58:23,698
This might be unpleasant for you to hear

977
00:58:23,781 --> 00:58:25,906
that there is some things that I would like to say

978
00:58:26,031 --> 00:58:27,240
in fact that I need to say.

979
00:58:27,365 --> 00:58:28,490
It won't matter anyway.

980
00:58:28,573 --> 00:58:29,990
Okay, probably it won't.

981
00:58:30,073 --> 00:58:31,573
Sad old story that everyone's forgotten

982
00:58:31,698 --> 00:58:33,656
I mean, Crist, I've even forgotten most of it.

983
00:58:33,781 --> 00:58:34,781
No, don't say that.

984
00:58:34,865 --> 00:58:36,281
Well, I have. Of course I have.

985
00:58:36,365 --> 00:58:41,365
If I haven't, I wouldn't be here.

986
00:58:41,490 --> 00:58:43,198
When it comes to it

987
00:58:43,281 --> 00:58:47,073
it's just stories of girls you used to know...

988
00:58:47,198 --> 00:58:49,198
wearing foolish striped tube tops.

989
00:58:49,323 --> 00:58:50,323
No, I thought about it.

990
00:58:50,406 --> 00:58:51,865
You weren't wearing a tube top.

991
00:58:51,990 --> 00:58:52,990
It was a dress...

992
00:58:53,115 --> 00:58:54,156
it was blue and white stripes

993
00:58:54,281 --> 00:58:55,865
but the top was cut like a tube top.

994
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:57,656
Yeah, I know, I remember the dress.

995
00:58:57,740 --> 00:58:59,906
What about the book?

996
00:59:03,281 --> 00:59:07,948
I don't know...it was something by...

997
00:59:08,073 --> 00:59:09,531
...it was Danielle Steele.

998
00:59:09,615 --> 00:59:11,365
I never read Danielle Steele!

999
00:59:11,490 --> 00:59:13,740
I never read Danielle Steele.

1000
00:59:13,865 --> 00:59:15,198
I so not read Danielle Steele.

1001
00:59:15,281 --> 00:59:17,198
It was written by a woman.

1002
00:59:17,281 --> 00:59:19,823
It was "The House of Mirth" by Edith Wharton.

1003
00:59:19,906 --> 00:59:21,323
All right. That sounds about right.

1004
00:59:21,406 --> 00:59:22,406
Not about. Exactly.

1005
00:59:22,490 --> 00:59:24,656
Okay. You were lying under a tree

1006
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:26,990
reading a book by Edith Wharton.

1007
00:59:27,073 --> 00:59:28,448
"The house of Mirth."

1008
00:59:28,531 --> 00:59:30,740
"The house of Mirth."

1009
00:59:30,865 --> 00:59:35,240
And it was an end-of-summer muggy Cape Cod day.

1010
00:59:35,365 --> 00:59:36,740
Actually there was a breeze.

1011
00:59:36,865 --> 00:59:39,198
And everyone else was in line to get food

1012
00:59:39,323 --> 00:59:41,406
I could tell you didn't wanna be disturbed

1013
00:59:41,531 --> 00:59:43,615
...so I said I don't know if you know...

1014
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:45,698
...but the food's ready.

1015
00:59:47,281 --> 00:59:49,865
And you said...

1016
00:59:51,990 --> 00:59:54,115
...the food will wait.

1017
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:56,031
And then you waved me away like I was your servant...

1018
00:59:56,115 --> 00:59:57,198
...but I won't be deterred.

1019
00:59:57,323 --> 00:59:58,698
So I took you by the hand...

1020
00:59:58,823 --> 01:00:03,031
...and I said no, it won't.

1021
01:00:03,156 --> 01:00:05,031
Your book dropped to the ground.

1022
01:00:05,115 --> 01:00:06,865
You took me by surprise.

1023
01:00:06,990 --> 01:00:08,740
And I don't know why...

1024
01:00:08,865 --> 01:00:12,823
...but I kissed you on the mouth...

1025
01:00:12,906 --> 01:00:14,781
...right then, and there.

1026
01:00:15,165 --> 01:00:16,540
How long were we married then?

1027
01:00:16,665 --> 01:00:18,498
Six months.

1028
01:00:18,623 --> 01:00:20,081
Not so long, really.

1029
01:00:20,165 --> 01:00:22,040
No, not so long.

1030
01:00:22,165 --> 01:00:24,831
And then what happened?

1031
01:00:24,956 --> 01:00:26,623
Well, it was the end of summer

1032
01:00:26,706 --> 01:00:28,415
We moved back to the city.

1033
01:00:28,498 --> 01:00:31,081
And then?

1034
01:00:31,165 --> 01:00:33,206
Well, you buy curtains...

1035
01:00:33,331 --> 01:00:35,623
...you walk the dog...

1036
01:00:35,706 --> 01:00:37,998
...you cook meals for two...

1037
01:00:38,123 --> 01:00:40,665
...you finish school...

1038
01:00:40,790 --> 01:00:42,456
...and you have sex once in the morning...

1039
01:00:42,540 --> 01:00:43,831
...and once in the night.

1040
01:00:43,956 --> 01:00:46,831
Sometimes twice.

1041
01:00:48,015 --> 01:00:52,640
But sometimes you are alone.

1042
01:00:52,765 --> 01:00:55,765
Sometimes you wait.

1043
01:00:55,890 --> 01:00:59,348
Your husband is young, foolish and careless.

1044
01:00:59,431 --> 01:01:00,431
No.

1045
01:01:00,431 --> 01:01:03,640
And you are pregnant.

1046
01:01:03,965 --> 01:01:04,598
No.

1047
01:01:08,423 --> 01:01:12,965
And you ran away.

1048
01:01:13,090 --> 01:01:16,465
You went as far as you could get.

1049
01:01:17,173 --> 01:01:19,965
You went to London, met a cardiologist...

1050
01:01:21,506 --> 01:01:22,506
...and you married him.

1051
01:01:22,506 --> 01:01:23,506
Now, straight to the bed.

1052
01:01:26,756 --> 01:01:28,923
Is that the ring I gave you?

1053
01:01:29,006 --> 01:01:30,006
No.

1054
01:01:30,090 --> 01:01:31,465
It looks like it.

1055
01:01:31,590 --> 01:01:33,631
It's a ring, it's a wedding ring.

1056
01:01:33,756 --> 01:01:37,131
It's gold and it's round.

1057
01:01:42,373 --> 01:01:44,998
What happened to the husband?

1058
01:01:45,081 --> 01:01:46,581
The first husband.

1059
01:01:46,706 --> 01:01:49,248
Well, he...

1060
01:01:49,331 --> 01:01:52,456
sometimes he thinks about ending it.

1061
01:01:52,540 --> 01:01:53,831
That is so not like him.

1062
01:01:53,915 --> 01:01:56,248
Well, sometimes you can't bear it.

1063
01:01:56,331 --> 01:01:58,581
The loneliness.

1064
01:02:11,623 --> 01:02:14,790
Then one day you're at a wedding...

1065
01:02:14,873 --> 01:02:16,623
and a man...

1066
01:02:16,706 --> 01:02:18,831
...sets a champagne flute in front of you.

1067
01:02:18,956 --> 01:02:20,456
You tell him you're not drinking.

1068
01:02:20,581 --> 01:02:22,248
The man makes stupid jokes.

1069
01:02:22,331 --> 01:02:24,331
The man thinks that if he talks fast enough...

1070
01:02:24,415 --> 01:02:26,665
...the woman might not notice.

1071
01:02:38,665 --> 01:02:40,498
Might not notice what?

1072
01:02:40,581 --> 01:02:43,415
That it's the same man.

1073
01:02:43,498 --> 01:02:48,165
That it's the husband. Her husband.

1074
01:02:48,690 --> 01:02:55,898
It'd be as if she's meeting him for the first time.

1075
01:02:59,065 --> 01:03:02,565
Does it work?

1076
01:03:02,690 --> 01:03:06,065
For a while anyway.

1077
01:03:06,148 --> 01:03:09,898
She takes him to her hotel room.

1078
01:03:09,981 --> 01:03:14,023
But as soon as the lights go down...

1079
01:03:14,148 --> 01:03:17,773
...she recognizes him.

1080
01:03:17,898 --> 01:03:19,940
She is one of those...

1081
01:03:20,065 --> 01:03:23,190
who see things better in the dark.

1082
01:03:30,648 --> 01:03:32,898
And then?

1083
01:03:32,981 --> 01:03:35,731
And then...

1084
01:03:35,856 --> 01:03:38,440
It's all over.

1085
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:46,031
It's over.

1086
01:04:30,365 --> 01:04:32,073
You could leave him.

1087
01:04:32,198 --> 01:04:33,198
I don't want to.

1088
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:34,823
- You could leave him. - I won't.

1089
01:04:34,948 --> 01:04:36,073
- You could leave him. - No.

1090
01:04:36,198 --> 01:04:37,240
- You... - No!

1091
01:04:37,365 --> 01:04:39,406
You don't know what I was gonna say there.

1092
01:04:41,573 --> 01:04:43,073
It was reasonably sure.

1093
01:04:43,198 --> 01:04:45,656
Now you'll never know. It's gone forever.

1094
01:04:48,740 --> 01:04:51,073
What were you gonna say?

1095
01:05:04,740 --> 01:05:06,656
You are 38 and you look it.

1096
01:05:06,740 --> 01:05:07,865
Fuck you!

1097
01:05:07,990 --> 01:05:09,656
And then it's over to 39...

1098
01:05:09,740 --> 01:05:12,073
Right, and then 40, and after 40 you may as well die.

1099
01:05:12,198 --> 01:05:13,281
Thanks.

1100
01:05:13,365 --> 01:05:15,240
If the cardiologist...

1101
01:05:15,365 --> 01:05:17,073
decides that you're too old and decrepit

1102
01:05:17,198 --> 01:05:18,740
and ugly to be at all lovable...

1103
01:05:18,865 --> 01:05:22,323
I am available to tolerate you in your golden years.

1104
01:05:27,990 --> 01:05:30,281
Thank you.

1105
01:05:30,365 --> 01:05:32,198
You're welcome.

1106
01:05:32,323 --> 01:05:35,698
I'll walk you, I'll water you and...

1107
01:05:35,823 --> 01:05:37,781
...I'll feed you...

1108
01:05:41,073 --> 01:05:43,698
Will Sarah the dancer live with us?

1109
01:05:44,198 --> 01:05:44,844
Of course not.

1110
01:05:46,156 --> 01:05:48,531
No, Sarah the dancer'll settle down

1111
01:05:48,615 --> 01:05:51,031
with a nice boy of her age.

1112
01:05:51,115 --> 01:05:53,948
Can you throw her over for me?

1113
01:05:54,031 --> 01:05:55,156
She left me.

1114
01:05:55,281 --> 01:05:57,156
Wisely.

1115
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:00,365
Will we still fight?

1116
01:06:00,490 --> 01:06:01,490
Not at all.

1117
01:06:01,573 --> 01:06:05,365
No. We're passed all that.

1118
01:06:05,490 --> 01:06:08,031
Will we play bingo on Sundays nights?

1119
01:06:08,156 --> 01:06:10,865
Yeah, except when we're travelling.

1120
01:06:10,948 --> 01:06:12,323
Where do we go?

1121
01:06:12,406 --> 01:06:16,031
Huh, Guam, Paraguay, Botswana...

1122
01:06:16,156 --> 01:06:17,406
Nowhere particular.

1123
01:06:17,531 --> 01:06:18,531
No.

1124
01:06:18,615 --> 01:06:22,573
We just... take the globe and then spin it

1125
01:06:22,698 --> 01:06:24,406
and go wherever our fingers land.

1126
01:06:24,531 --> 01:06:25,615
And have sex, huh?

1127
01:06:25,740 --> 01:06:27,156
Why, you know what?

1128
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:29,198
I'll be totally indisposed since I've turned 40...

1129
01:06:29,281 --> 01:06:30,656
...so there isn't much of that.

1130
01:06:30,740 --> 01:06:32,406
It works better that way probably.

1131
01:06:32,531 --> 01:06:35,531
Yeah. We sleep in separate beds.

1132
01:06:35,656 --> 01:06:38,698
Yeah, but sometimes I push together.

1133
01:06:38,823 --> 01:06:39,948
Why?

1134
01:06:40,031 --> 01:06:41,865
Because I remember what you looked like...

1135
01:06:41,990 --> 01:06:44,698
before you're ravaged by old age of 40.

1136
01:06:44,823 --> 01:06:47,698
So once a week I will close my eyes...

1137
01:06:47,823 --> 01:06:49,865
...and I rub up against you a little bit.

1138
01:06:49,990 --> 01:06:51,573
That's disgusting!

1139
01:06:51,698 --> 01:06:53,031
But you tolerate me

1140
01:06:53,115 --> 01:06:54,531
because you know that I love you.

1141
01:06:54,615 --> 01:06:55,656
Well, yeah.

1142
01:06:55,740 --> 01:06:58,156
You know you're just a dirty old pervert.

1143
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:01,698
Yes, I am. But I'm your dirty old pervert.

1144
01:07:03,906 --> 01:07:07,323
Lucky me.

1145
01:07:07,406 --> 01:07:11,656
And when we're really, really old...

1146
01:07:11,740 --> 01:07:14,490
...we agree to end it.

1147
01:07:14,573 --> 01:07:18,198
We'll take poison like in Romeo and Juliett

1148
01:07:18,323 --> 01:07:19,323
And will hold hands and...

1149
01:07:19,406 --> 01:07:22,698
...both our hearts will stop.

1150
01:07:44,131 --> 01:07:47,798
And both of our hearts stop.

1151
01:07:50,298 --> 01:07:52,423
Only my poison...

1152
01:07:52,548 --> 01:07:54,840
...like Juliett's, is an act.

1153
01:07:54,965 --> 01:07:56,923
It's a false elixir.

1154
01:07:57,048 --> 01:08:01,506
So you think I'm dead, but I'm not.

1155
01:08:01,631 --> 01:08:02,798
Right, I forgot that part.

1156
01:08:02,881 --> 01:08:06,131
Yeah. So about ten minutes after you died for good...

1157
01:08:06,215 --> 01:08:08,756
I wake up.

1158
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:10,506
And what do you do?

1159
01:08:10,631 --> 01:08:13,631
Well, I'm really sad that you're dead now

1160
01:08:13,756 --> 01:08:17,340
but... I'm having second thoughts.

1161
01:08:17,465 --> 01:08:20,173
I was never a 'suicide-kind of girl.

1162
01:08:20,298 --> 01:08:22,340
So...

1163
01:08:22,465 --> 01:08:24,923
...I pack my bags...

1164
01:08:25,006 --> 01:08:31,173
and I take the first plane back to London, to Jeffrey.

1165
01:08:35,215 --> 01:08:36,256
How romantic.

1166
01:08:36,342 --> 01:08:37,423
Yeah.

1167
01:08:37,548 --> 01:08:40,006
Fuck! What time is it?

1168
01:08:40,131 --> 01:08:41,965
- It is late. - How?

1169
01:08:42,048 --> 01:08:43,298
- It is late! - How so late?

1170
01:08:43,381 --> 01:08:45,006
I should lie to you. It's 3.15

1171
01:08:45,131 --> 01:08:46,256
Shit!

1172
01:08:52,731 --> 01:08:54,440
I'm gonna get into...

1173
01:08:54,565 --> 01:08:57,773
Can you just make sure My stuff's packed, please?

1174
01:09:12,648 --> 01:09:19,773
Well, I'm glad I ran into you

1175
01:09:19,898 --> 01:09:22,731
...glad that we saw each other after all this time.

1176
01:09:24,815 --> 01:09:27,690
have imagined it so often, you know?

1177
01:09:30,148 --> 01:09:33,273
Tomorrow I'll wonder if it even happened at all.

1178
01:09:46,690 --> 01:09:48,565
I'm glad I ran into you!

1179
01:09:49,898 --> 01:09:52,648
Somehow I feel so much lonelier than before.

1180
01:09:52,731 --> 01:09:55,981
Yeah...

1181
01:09:56,065 --> 01:09:58,898
God, I used to think I could call you...

1182
01:09:59,023 --> 01:10:02,981
...go out to lunch, get married.

1183
01:10:03,065 --> 01:10:07,481
How simple is that.

1184
01:10:07,565 --> 01:10:09,898
The promise of all those...

1185
01:10:09,981 --> 01:10:13,523
...high school physics film strips fulfilled.

1186
01:10:13,648 --> 01:10:16,690
Your spilled milk leaps back in the pitchers.

1187
01:10:16,815 --> 01:10:21,815
Broken teacups  miraculously reassemble.

1188
01:10:22,023 --> 01:10:23,690
time really can... you know... time...

1189
01:10:23,773 --> 01:10:27,065
time really can move in two directions.

1190
01:10:27,148 --> 01:10:29,065
time really can move in two directions.

1191
01:10:29,190 --> 01:10:31,690
It doen't matter universe anyway.

1192
01:10:34,231 --> 01:10:36,231
Which is to say...

1193
01:10:42,065 --> 01:10:42,815
Which is to say...

1194
01:10:56,731 --> 01:10:58,231
Which is...

1195
01:11:03,190 --> 01:11:05,981
I don't know. Which is to say that I...

1196
01:11:06,065 --> 01:11:09,065
...I think everything could still turn out.

1197
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:24,665
Now everything seems much more definitive.

1198
01:11:24,790 --> 01:11:26,665
Seems so much more real.

1199
01:11:26,790 --> 01:11:30,165
It seems much more final.

1200
01:11:34,790 --> 01:11:38,415
Now milk once spilled cannot unspill?

1201
01:11:38,498 --> 01:11:42,165
And a broken cup is always be a broken teacup.

1202
01:11:43,406 --> 01:11:44,848
You know it's funny 'cause...

1203
01:11:44,931 --> 01:11:48,431
everyone thinks they shouldn't mention you to me.

1204
01:11:50,973 --> 01:11:53,098
No, but the omission...

1205
01:11:56,598 --> 01:11:59,765
The omission only makes it worse.

1206
01:12:01,390 --> 01:12:04,348
Well I like to hear about you sometimes.

1207
01:12:19,431 --> 01:12:21,681
I love you.

1208
01:12:23,015 --> 01:12:24,015
For better or worse...

1209
01:12:24,098 --> 01:12:26,265
...you can take that with you on your travels.

1210
01:12:31,890 --> 01:12:34,015
Shit.

1211
01:12:40,306 --> 01:12:41,515
Were you saying something?

1212
01:12:41,598 --> 01:12:44,015
'cause I couldn't hear with the shower on.

1213
01:12:44,098 --> 01:12:46,765
No, nothing important.

1214
01:12:46,890 --> 01:12:48,181
That's Jeffrey.

1215
01:12:51,348 --> 01:12:53,348
That's nice.

1216
01:13:01,273 --> 01:13:03,190
That's Maggie.

1217
01:13:03,273 --> 01:13:05,648
She's 4.

1218
01:13:05,731 --> 01:13:07,773
And that's Elsa, she is 8.

1219
01:13:07,898 --> 01:13:10,815
And That's Gwen. She's the eldest.

1220
01:13:10,898 --> 01:13:11,940
She's gonna be, um...

1221
01:13:12,065 --> 01:13:14,773
Well, she's gonna be 12 in two weeks.

1222
01:13:14,898 --> 01:13:16,565
They look like a handful.

1223
01:13:16,648 --> 01:13:19,898
No, they're not that bad really.

1224
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:27,481
Are they...? Are they yours?

1225
01:13:27,565 --> 01:13:29,440
Oh, no. God, no.

1226
01:13:29,565 --> 01:13:32,523
No, they belong to another woman.

1227
01:13:32,606 --> 01:13:34,731
What? From his first marriage?

1228
01:13:34,856 --> 01:13:36,398
Yeah.

1229
01:13:39,398 --> 01:13:41,231
Did you check all the drawers?

1230
01:13:42,315 --> 01:13:46,190
Oh, yeah. They're all empty.

1231
01:13:50,481 --> 01:13:53,273
I couldn't get your bridesmaids dress in the bags...

1232
01:13:53,398 --> 01:13:56,356
so you probably have to take it separately.

1233
01:13:56,481 --> 01:13:57,481
You know what?

1234
01:13:57,523 --> 01:14:00,523
Can you just return it to your sister for me?

1235
01:14:00,606 --> 01:14:01,606
You know what?

1236
01:14:01,690 --> 01:14:06,356
She could maybe sent it to the original 7th bridesmaid.

1237
01:14:06,940 --> 01:14:09,606
No. Not I don't think that would be a very good idea.

1238
01:14:09,731 --> 01:14:10,773
I guess that's not.

1239
01:14:14,398 --> 01:14:15,898
You could keep it.

1240
01:14:16,023 --> 01:14:18,023
A memento of your conquest.

1241
01:14:18,906 --> 01:14:23,656
No. Sarah might ask questions about whether or not...

1242
01:14:24,998 --> 01:14:26,623
Yeah, I suppose.

1243
01:14:30,331 --> 01:14:32,540
You know what? I don't care.

1244
01:14:32,665 --> 01:14:35,790
Just... throw it away on your way house?

1245
01:14:36,073 --> 01:14:37,656
I don't care. Some dustbin or something...

1246
01:14:38,081 --> 01:14:39,081
Hang on!

1247
01:14:45,465 --> 01:14:48,256
That's not quite what I had in mind.

1248
01:14:57,881 --> 01:14:59,798
Hello.

1249
01:15:01,173 --> 01:15:03,756
Oh, hang on, one second.

1250
01:15:04,723 --> 01:15:06,931
It's for you...

1251
01:15:09,765 --> 01:15:13,390
I think our phones must've got switched.

1252
01:15:15,265 --> 01:15:19,306
Hello? Sarah, Sarah...

1253
01:15:19,431 --> 01:15:21,265
she's just a friend of mine.

1254
01:15:21,390 --> 01:15:25,306
All right? Hold on.

1255
01:15:25,431 --> 01:15:27,556
She wants to talk to you.

1256
01:15:36,390 --> 01:15:38,015
Is that Sarah?

1257
01:15:38,098 --> 01:15:40,515
Me? Honestly I'm no-one, I'm just an old friend.

1258
01:15:40,598 --> 01:15:45,015
An old friend, just like goes back ten years.

1259
01:15:45,798 --> 01:15:46,798
Listen.

1260
01:15:46,798 --> 01:15:48,215
No-one to worry about at all.

1261
01:15:48,298 --> 01:15:50,673
Mind you, knowing your boyfriend as I once did...

1262
01:15:50,798 --> 01:15:54,715
I completely understand if you find that hard to believe...

1263
01:15:54,798 --> 01:15:57,256
Yes, we bumped into each other at the wedding...

1264
01:15:57,340 --> 01:16:00,006
and spent all night catching up.

1265
01:16:00,131 --> 01:16:02,590
Yeah.

1266
01:16:02,715 --> 01:16:03,798
I mean, mind you, mainly because I'd...

1267
01:16:03,923 --> 01:16:08,256
really wanna stay up and switch time zones

1268
01:16:08,381 --> 01:16:10,715
'cause I'm just about to get on a plane.

1269
01:16:10,798 --> 01:16:13,048
I live in London...

1270
01:16:13,131 --> 01:16:14,881
and I just got here yesterday.

1271
01:16:14,965 --> 01:16:17,090
I'm about to take a flight back right now.

1272
01:16:17,215 --> 01:16:18,215
Five minutes.

1273
01:16:18,298 --> 01:16:19,923
But thank you very much for phoning me

1274
01:16:20,048 --> 01:16:21,465
because if you hadn't phoned now,

1275
01:16:21,590 --> 01:16:24,965
we wouldn't have realized that we'd actually swapped phones.

1276
01:16:25,090 --> 01:16:28,340
Yeah, I guess we do.

1277
01:16:28,465 --> 01:16:31,131
I haven't really thought about it, but I guess we do.

1278
01:16:34,256 --> 01:16:36,465
No, no, no, it's all right, don't worry about it.

1279
01:16:36,548 --> 01:16:38,548
I completely understand.

1280
01:16:38,631 --> 01:16:41,131
Do you wanna speak to him?

1281
01:16:44,173 --> 01:16:45,590
Okay.

1282
01:16:45,673 --> 01:16:47,756
All right, I give him the message.

1283
01:16:47,881 --> 01:16:50,798
All right, take care.

1284
01:17:01,881 --> 01:17:03,298
Same phones.

1285
01:17:03,423 --> 01:17:04,423
Funny, huh?

1286
01:17:04,423 --> 01:17:06,965
Yeah.

1287
01:17:07,090 --> 01:17:12,840
You're meeting her for breakfast at the diner near your apartment.

1288
01:17:12,965 --> 01:17:14,423
She understands everything by the way.

1289
01:17:14,548 --> 01:17:15,798
What did you say?

1290
01:17:15,923 --> 01:17:18,965
That we used to know each other,

1291
01:17:19,090 --> 01:17:21,215
and we bumped into each other at the wedding

1292
01:17:21,298 --> 01:17:23,381
...and spend all the night catching up

1293
01:17:23,465 --> 01:17:25,631
isn't it funny? Our phones got switched...

1294
01:17:25,756 --> 01:17:28,506
But hey, better we could get that now rather than later

1295
01:17:28,631 --> 01:17:30,965
...because I'm about to take a plane to London.

1296
01:17:31,090 --> 01:17:32,256
If you're ever in London...

1297
01:17:32,340 --> 01:17:33,715
um, basically, I told the truth.

1298
01:17:33,798 --> 01:17:36,715
The truth mostly.

1299
01:17:36,798 --> 01:17:38,131
Everything important.

1300
01:17:38,215 --> 01:17:39,423
What about the sex?

1301
01:17:39,506 --> 01:17:41,965
Fuck the sex.

1302
01:17:44,090 --> 01:17:50,040
You know I was thinking Maybe I'll take a shower.

1303
01:17:50,381 --> 01:17:51,965
Right, take a shower.

1304
01:17:52,090 --> 01:17:56,506
You have the room till noon.

1305
01:17:56,631 --> 01:17:59,423
After that you're on your own.

1306
01:18:01,465 --> 01:18:04,090
you know? Maybe I'll...

1307
01:18:04,215 --> 01:18:07,506
- maybe I'll come down now, after all. - No shower?

1308
01:18:10,465 --> 01:18:13,715
No, let's go down together.

1309
01:18:13,798 --> 01:18:15,881
Somebody might see us.

1310
01:18:15,965 --> 01:18:18,965
Nobody remembers who you are.

1311
01:18:19,048 --> 01:18:23,923
Sorry. And everybody expects me to behave badly anyway...

1312
01:18:24,006 --> 01:18:26,590
You could've just said it's early.

1313
01:18:28,881 --> 01:18:30,840
It's early.

1314
01:18:55,665 --> 01:18:56,665
There's cameras in here.

1315
01:18:56,665 --> 01:18:58,831
No-one cares about that.

1316
01:18:58,956 --> 01:19:00,706
Guess, you are right.

1317
01:19:05,623 --> 01:19:07,031
Maybe this securuty guard thinks

1318
01:19:07,156 --> 01:19:10,115
we're two newlyweds starting their new lives together.

1319
01:19:19,240 --> 01:19:20,323
- It's light. - No, I want to, please.

1320
01:19:20,406 --> 01:19:22,115
- I want to. - No, it's very light.

1321
01:19:37,065 --> 01:19:39,606
Why did you come? Really.

1322
01:19:39,731 --> 01:19:42,398
Do you want me to say I was hoping I'd see you?

1323
01:19:42,523 --> 01:19:44,690
Yes. And I want you to mean it.

1324
01:19:44,773 --> 01:19:48,256
You're so romantic.

1325
01:19:48,356 --> 01:19:50,023
By romantic you mean I'm old fashioned?

1326
01:19:50,106 --> 01:19:54,148
No, by romantic I mean romantic.

1327
01:19:56,731 --> 01:19:59,148
Hang on. you know what?

1328
01:19:59,231 --> 01:20:01,065
Do you mind getting rid of these for me?

1329
01:20:02,148 --> 01:20:03,315
Why?

1330
01:20:03,398 --> 01:20:07,731
My husband doesn't know I smoke.

1331
01:20:49,731 --> 01:20:52,106
you care which way I go?

1332
01:20:52,231 --> 01:20:53,356
I don't care.

1333
01:20:53,481 --> 01:20:57,023
You care which way I go?

1334
01:20:57,148 --> 01:20:58,690
No.

1335
01:20:58,773 --> 01:21:00,731
My sister got married last night.

1336
01:21:00,856 --> 01:21:02,231
Congratulations.

1337
01:21:02,315 --> 01:21:03,606
it don't matter this hour anyway...

1338
01:21:03,731 --> 01:21:05,690
...but some people have a preference.

1339
01:21:05,773 --> 01:21:08,856
I think she's gonna be very unhappy.

1340
01:21:08,940 --> 01:21:10,023
I don't care.

1341
01:21:10,148 --> 01:21:11,231
Ah, I wouldn't worry.

1342
01:21:11,356 --> 01:21:13,190
These things always work themselves out.

1343
01:21:13,273 --> 01:21:14,731
You're not from around here, are you?

1344
01:21:14,856 --> 01:21:15,856
Are you married?

1345
01:21:15,856 --> 01:21:16,856
Yeah.

1346
01:21:16,898 --> 01:21:20,648
No. I used to be...but not any more.

1347
01:21:20,731 --> 01:21:21,731
Are you happy?

1348
01:21:21,815 --> 01:21:23,231
Happy enough.

1349
01:21:23,315 --> 01:21:24,648
Good for you.

1350
01:21:24,731 --> 01:21:27,065
It's good to be happy.

1351
01:21:27,148 --> 01:21:30,106
But it's so fucking hard, you know.

1352
