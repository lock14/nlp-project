1
00:00:40,976 --> 00:00:45,398
There's nothing like
the experience of raising your first dog.

2
00:00:45,898 --> 00:00:48,609
The simple joy of walking side by side
with your buddy...

3
00:00:48,776 --> 00:00:51,320
...out in the fresh air, throwing a stick.

4
00:00:52,029 --> 00:00:56,408
Spending some quiet time,
just you and your very best friend.

5
00:01:02,331 --> 00:01:05,418
Of course, that wasn't my experience.

6
00:01:05,793 --> 00:01:07,210
That kid's not even me.

7
00:01:12,132 --> 00:01:13,259
That's me.

8
00:01:13,426 --> 00:01:17,763
And that crazy hound I'm chasing
is Marley, the world's worst dog.

9
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:19,097
Sorry.

10
00:01:19,265 --> 00:01:20,599
Or so I thought.

11
00:01:20,765 --> 00:01:23,603
But our story begins
before Marley was born...

12
00:01:24,061 --> 00:01:26,146
...four years before,
on my wedding day...

13
00:01:26,313 --> 00:01:29,525
...which happened to be the day
of the worst freak spring blizzard...

14
00:01:29,692 --> 00:01:33,403
...in the history of southern Michigan,
the same day our car broke down.

15
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:35,114
But we didn't care.

16
00:01:35,281 --> 00:01:37,533
Oh, God, that feels so good.

17
00:01:41,871 --> 00:01:45,332
So, what do you think that means,
a blizzard on your wedding day?

18
00:01:45,498 --> 00:01:48,127
Is that good luck? Is that bad luck?

19
00:01:48,293 --> 00:01:50,462
I think it's good luck.

20
00:01:52,715 --> 00:01:55,176
- How did I get you?
- What?

21
00:01:55,343 --> 00:01:59,138
Honestly, how did I...?
How did I get that lucky?

22
00:01:59,305 --> 00:02:01,182
Well, you know...

23
00:02:01,807 --> 00:02:05,477
...I get asked that question all the time.

24
00:02:05,894 --> 00:02:09,564
Come on. Are you kidding, honey?

25
00:02:09,731 --> 00:02:11,317
You're part of the plan.

26
00:02:11,484 --> 00:02:13,818
- The plan?
- Mm. My plan.

27
00:02:14,277 --> 00:02:20,784
Step one, meet an incredibly sweet,
smart, sexy man.

28
00:02:20,951 --> 00:02:23,287
Done. Step two?

29
00:02:23,454 --> 00:02:24,788
Marry you instead.

30
00:02:24,955 --> 00:02:27,582
- Oh.
- Oh, now.

31
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:28,918
Then step three...

32
00:02:29,085 --> 00:02:32,337
- I don't think I can take any more.
- You don't want to hear step three?

33
00:02:32,504 --> 00:02:33,923
- What's step three?
- It's easy.

34
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:36,841
- Be gentle.
- Move someplace warmer.

35
00:02:37,009 --> 00:02:38,802
I knew you were gonna say that.

36
00:03:59,841 --> 00:04:01,259
- Okay.
- Thank you.

37
00:04:01,426 --> 00:04:04,722
- All right, you know you got this, right?
- Oh, yeah. I got it.

38
00:04:04,889 --> 00:04:07,390
Who are you?
- I'm John Grogan?

39
00:04:07,557 --> 00:04:10,978
No, you're John frigging Grogan,
who's about to get a job as a reporter...

40
00:04:11,145 --> 00:04:14,774
...for a major metropolitan newspaper.

41
00:04:14,941 --> 00:04:17,985
- I don't feel like getting out of the car.
- Well, you have to.

42
00:04:18,151 --> 00:04:21,947
- Why don't we drive around the block?
- No, baby. Come on, get out of the car.

43
00:04:22,113 --> 00:04:23,533
Get out.

44
00:04:25,201 --> 00:04:26,536
- Now, who am I again?
- Oh, please.

45
00:04:26,701 --> 00:04:28,495
Ah.

46
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,997
Sebastian says you won some award?

47
00:04:31,165 --> 00:04:32,959
Mitchy. Yeah, I have a Mitchy.

48
00:04:34,377 --> 00:04:36,963
It's like a Pulitzer,
but from western Michigan.

49
00:04:37,129 --> 00:04:39,548
A Mitchy.

50
00:04:39,715 --> 00:04:44,928
So tell me, what made you leave
the estimable Kalamazoo Gazette?

51
00:04:45,096 --> 00:04:51,269
Well, as you know, Sebastian and I were
in college together, and he... He...

52
00:04:51,435 --> 00:04:53,771
He was always saying
how great South Florida is...

53
00:04:53,937 --> 00:04:56,481
...and that maybe my wife and I
might enjoy it here...

54
00:04:56,649 --> 00:04:58,317
...so we decided to come down here.

55
00:04:58,483 --> 00:05:00,987
- Are you a comedian too?
- Excuse me?

56
00:05:01,153 --> 00:05:02,487
Like your friend over here?

57
00:05:03,531 --> 00:05:06,992
- No.
- He's walking a very thin line.

58
00:05:07,158 --> 00:05:09,077
It's a good thing he knows how to write.

59
00:05:09,245 --> 00:05:11,622
So your wife is Jenny Havens?

60
00:05:11,788 --> 00:05:15,584
Yes. Jenny Grogan, because
we're married. She took my name.

61
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,754
- She get the job at the Post?
- Yes, she did.

62
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,673
- Why didn't they want you over there?
- Well, I didn't apply.

63
00:05:21,841 --> 00:05:25,261
Jenny's more of a feature writer,
and I'm more of a straight news writer.

64
00:05:25,427 --> 00:05:27,512
I thought this would be a better fit
for that.

65
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,391
Think you're better
than the journalism-school graduates...

66
00:05:30,557 --> 00:05:32,768
...that came here looking for work
this morning?

67
00:05:32,935 --> 00:05:34,394
I don't know if I'm better. I...

68
00:05:34,562 --> 00:05:37,648
What I do know is that I have a tendency
to surprise myself.

69
00:05:37,814 --> 00:05:41,026
Ten years ago I was doing bong hits
and playing "Donkey Kong. "

70
00:05:41,194 --> 00:05:45,697
I never dreamed I'd get into college,
but I did, and I graduated with honors.

71
00:05:45,865 --> 00:05:48,867
And I never thought I'd get a job
at a real newspaper, but I did.

72
00:05:49,034 --> 00:05:52,579
And I certainly never thought I'd get a girl
like Jenny Havens to marry me...

73
00:05:52,747 --> 00:05:54,624
...but I did.

74
00:05:57,752 --> 00:05:59,002
So?

75
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:01,213
They already got a guy
on the Metro desk.

76
00:06:01,422 --> 00:06:02,714
Oh.

77
00:06:02,882 --> 00:06:04,216
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry, honey.

78
00:06:04,716 --> 00:06:08,553
So they're putting me on a little thing
they like to call "Desert Storm. "

79
00:06:09,221 --> 00:06:10,639
- You got the job?
- Got the job.

80
00:06:10,805 --> 00:06:12,432
You got the job, baby.

81
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,228
Oh, John Grogan, I knew it.
I just knew it.

82
00:06:16,394 --> 00:06:18,898
Okay, look. Watch this. Look.

83
00:06:19,064 --> 00:06:21,733
See what happens? Job: Done.

84
00:06:21,901 --> 00:06:24,028
- So, what's next? Lunch?
- House.

85
00:06:24,194 --> 00:06:25,779
- House.
- House.

86
00:06:46,132 --> 00:06:48,427
That can transmit
remote television pictures...

87
00:06:48,593 --> 00:06:50,428
...of Iraqi ships and other targets.

88
00:06:50,596 --> 00:06:54,100
Did you get to the quote
about the speed bumps yet?

89
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,644
- "If they save even one life... "
- "It would be worth it.

90
00:06:57,812 --> 00:07:01,189
And with that,
Janet Dickerson's eyes filled with tears. "

91
00:07:01,357 --> 00:07:02,399
Filled with tears.

92
00:07:02,567 --> 00:07:04,569
- Do you like that or is it too corny?
- Yeah.

93
00:07:04,735 --> 00:07:07,446
- No.
- Is it a little over-the-top?

94
00:07:08,531 --> 00:07:11,242
Hey, honey, what happened
to the, uh, Desert Storm piece?

95
00:07:11,783 --> 00:07:16,079
That's it. The injured girl's dad's
in Kuwait. Is that not in there?

96
00:07:16,247 --> 00:07:19,292
Uh, uh-uh. I think they cut that.

97
00:07:19,792 --> 00:07:22,043
They even...
They spelled your name wrong.

98
00:07:22,211 --> 00:07:25,088
- "John Gorgan. "
- You're kidding.

99
00:07:25,255 --> 00:07:27,300
- Let me see that. Are you joking?
- Forget it.

100
00:07:27,466 --> 00:07:31,345
You know what? It's good. It's really
good. It's got the facts, it's got color.

101
00:07:31,512 --> 00:07:33,555
- It's a really solid piece.
- Thanks.

102
00:07:33,723 --> 00:07:37,310
I tried to breathe some life into it,
you know?

103
00:07:37,475 --> 00:07:38,810
Yes.

104
00:07:38,978 --> 00:07:41,314
I like this article.
I'm almost done with yours.

105
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,358
This idea of voting machines
sounds really efficient.

106
00:07:44,524 --> 00:07:45,985
When you get to the next page...

107
00:07:46,151 --> 00:07:48,987
...you'll see that I talk
about what could happen.

108
00:07:49,154 --> 00:07:51,490
Oh, okay, I see, it continues.

109
00:07:52,324 --> 00:07:54,034
Yeah.

110
00:07:55,494 --> 00:07:58,872
But actually,
the rest of it is really just okay.

111
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:03,711
- It's actually kind of boring.
- No, no, it's... I'm enjoying this.

112
00:08:04,961 --> 00:08:06,213
Wow.

113
00:08:06,379 --> 00:08:09,132
They really gave you a lot of space.

114
00:08:11,384 --> 00:08:15,096
Oh, damn. Killed another one.

115
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:19,894
How am I ever supposed to take care
of a kid if I can't even keep a plant alive?

116
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,687
Well, what did you expect, man?
You bought a house.

117
00:08:22,855 --> 00:08:25,858
- A house with a spare room.
- What's the matter with a spare room?

118
00:08:26,024 --> 00:08:28,235
It's empty, John,
that's what's wrong with it.

119
00:08:28,401 --> 00:08:29,862
And you know what else is empty?

120
00:08:30,028 --> 00:08:31,322
Her womb.

121
00:08:31,488 --> 00:08:32,948
I'm worried Jenny's at step seven.

122
00:08:33,115 --> 00:08:34,158
What?

123
00:08:34,325 --> 00:08:37,620
She's got her whole life organized and
planned out according to these steps.

124
00:08:37,787 --> 00:08:40,038
Okay, that's scary. Unbelievable.

125
00:08:40,206 --> 00:08:41,540
You want my advice?

126
00:08:41,706 --> 00:08:43,793
Get her, like, a bird
or a puppy or something.

127
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,001
What, like a parakeet?

128
00:08:45,168 --> 00:08:47,837
Something other than you
that she has to take care of.

129
00:08:48,004 --> 00:08:50,591
You got a kid, you're a dad.
You're not you anymore.

130
00:08:50,758 --> 00:08:53,385
- You got a dog, you're a master.
- Master.

131
00:08:53,552 --> 00:08:55,346
- You're still a guy.
- Still got a life.

132
00:08:55,513 --> 00:08:57,932
- Exactly.
- And a dog.

133
00:08:58,099 --> 00:09:00,893
Yeah, but you've stopped her clock
for a few years.

134
00:09:01,059 --> 00:09:02,727
- I never had a dog.
- Nothing to it.

135
00:09:02,894 --> 00:09:05,147
Feed them, walk them,
let them out now and again.

136
00:09:05,313 --> 00:09:08,900
But it doesn't really matter.
You're not gonna take care of it, Jenny is.

137
00:09:09,067 --> 00:09:10,695
Sebastian!
- Yo.

138
00:09:10,861 --> 00:09:12,822
Your travel's been approved.
Hit the road.

139
00:09:12,989 --> 00:09:15,533
- Where are you going?
I'm going to Colombia.

140
00:09:16,325 --> 00:09:20,328
I got a guy down there that says
he can put me next to Pablo Escobar.

141
00:09:20,495 --> 00:09:21,663
I'm doing a piece.

142
00:09:21,831 --> 00:09:25,585
I follow a single coca leaf
from the jungle to the streets of Miami.

143
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,546
Sounds like a good idea.
You gotta be careful down there...

144
00:09:28,712 --> 00:09:30,338
Gorgan!

145
00:09:30,505 --> 00:09:34,427
- Grogan.
- Grodin. A fire at the county dump.

146
00:09:34,594 --> 00:09:36,761
- Methane leak.
- Methane?

147
00:09:36,928 --> 00:09:38,931
Yeah, I want two paragraphs
for the blotter.

148
00:09:41,683 --> 00:09:43,019
Methane.

149
00:09:43,186 --> 00:09:45,354
Woodward and Bernstein,
eat your heart out.

150
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,442
What kind of dog?

151
00:09:50,109 --> 00:09:52,278
- You remember Caroline?
- The nurse?

152
00:09:52,445 --> 00:09:54,614
She was a nursery-school teacher,
I don't know.

153
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:58,576
Anyway, she had this great dog, Daisy.

154
00:09:58,743 --> 00:10:02,078
- It was a Labradoodle.
- "Labradoodle"?

155
00:10:02,245 --> 00:10:05,791
- Maybe a Labrador.
- All right, get her a Labrador.

156
00:10:05,957 --> 00:10:09,044
Supposed to be just like kids,
only easier to train.

157
00:10:09,669 --> 00:10:12,715
"Labradoodle"? Come on.

158
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:24,393
- This does not smell like an IHOP.
- We got a little surprise first.

159
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:25,602
Here we go.

160
00:10:25,769 --> 00:10:27,812
Now, I want you to walk right here,
my dear.

161
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,315
Okay.

162
00:10:29,481 --> 00:10:32,317
Come on.
Oh, God.

163
00:10:32,485 --> 00:10:34,028
- Okay.
- Are you Grogan?

164
00:10:34,195 --> 00:10:36,780
Yes.
- Expected you an hour ago.

165
00:10:36,947 --> 00:10:40,033
You're gonna like this. Step up.
It's all right. Okay?

166
00:10:40,201 --> 00:10:41,786
- Sorry about the mess.
Okay.

167
00:10:41,952 --> 00:10:46,081
- And the noise. And the smell.
- What's happening?

168
00:10:46,249 --> 00:10:48,042
Come on.

169
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,168
- Can I look?
- No, no. Almost, almost.

170
00:10:50,336 --> 00:10:51,962
- Okay. Okay, ready?
- Really?

171
00:10:52,129 --> 00:10:55,006
One, two, three, go.

172
00:10:55,173 --> 00:10:58,344
- Happy birthday.
What?

173
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:01,389
- God, they're adorable.
- Get in.

174
00:11:02,139 --> 00:11:04,350
Oh, my... My birthday's not for a month.

175
00:11:04,517 --> 00:11:08,270
Oh, that's okay,
they can't leave for three weeks anyway.

176
00:11:08,437 --> 00:11:12,859
- John, we didn't discuss this.
- I know, but it was a surprise. You can't.

177
00:11:13,024 --> 00:11:15,861
Hi, guys.
- Just rescued the mom last month.

178
00:11:16,028 --> 00:11:19,155
Family that gave her up
didn't even know she was pregnant.

179
00:11:19,322 --> 00:11:21,951
- You sure we're ready for this?
Well, like I told you...

180
00:11:22,118 --> 00:11:25,203
...you gotta wait three weeks
before you can bring them home.

181
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:26,913
- I'm not even gonna be here.
- Why?

182
00:11:27,081 --> 00:11:29,875
- I'll be in Gainesville, covering that trial.
- Oh, that's okay.

183
00:11:30,042 --> 00:11:33,629
It'll give me a chance to bond with him
and get a head start on training him.

184
00:11:33,796 --> 00:11:35,673
Get him squared away
before you get home.

185
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,133
- That's true.
- Yeah.

186
00:11:37,299 --> 00:11:42,554
- Well, how are we gonna pick one?
- Girls are 300, boys are 275.

187
00:11:42,721 --> 00:11:46,808
Except for that little guy there.
Him you could have for 200 even.

188
00:11:46,975 --> 00:11:51,062
This one? You're so sweet.
You're like a little clearance puppy.

189
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:53,566
- Hello, puppy.
This one likes you.

190
00:11:53,899 --> 00:11:55,985
Clearance Puppy likes you.

191
00:11:56,235 --> 00:11:58,486
Well, that's your guy.

192
00:11:58,653 --> 00:12:01,072
Aw. I was gonna pick you anyway.

193
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,576
Don't tell anybody.
Don't tell the others.

194
00:12:07,955 --> 00:12:11,250
Honey, be careful.
- We gotta double-time it a little bit here.

195
00:12:11,417 --> 00:12:14,086
- I really wish I didn't have to go.
- It's gonna be great.

196
00:12:14,253 --> 00:12:16,588
You spent eight months on this trial.
I'm jealous.

197
00:12:16,755 --> 00:12:19,424
Really? Tax evasion?
That's what makes you jealous?

198
00:12:19,591 --> 00:12:21,719
Well, it's sexier than speed bumps.

199
00:12:21,885 --> 00:12:24,554
- Call me the minute you get him home.
- Okay. Okay.

200
00:12:24,721 --> 00:12:28,017
- We also have to come up with a name.
- Yes, well, let's brainstorm it.

201
00:12:28,183 --> 00:12:30,602
I'll just call him Clearance Puppy
till you get back.

202
00:12:30,769 --> 00:12:31,812
Are you gonna be okay?

203
00:12:31,979 --> 00:12:33,730
- Worried about me with a puppy?
- I am.

204
00:12:33,898 --> 00:12:35,942
- Me, John frigging Grogan? Come on.
- I know.

205
00:12:36,107 --> 00:12:39,403
- Goodbye. I love you. You look pretty.
- Thank you. I love you. Bye.

206
00:12:44,783 --> 00:12:47,119
How you doing there, buddy?

207
00:12:47,286 --> 00:12:49,621
Kind of a big day for you.

208
00:12:51,874 --> 00:12:55,919
Let's listen to the radio.
Awkward silences.

209
00:12:57,922 --> 00:12:59,798
You like that? You like Bob Marley?

210
00:13:01,133 --> 00:13:05,346
Bob. Would that be a good name? Bob.

211
00:13:05,513 --> 00:13:06,931
Bob. Come here, Bob.

212
00:13:07,097 --> 00:13:11,269
Or Robert when you got older?
More dignified?

213
00:13:11,644 --> 00:13:14,563
Marley? You like that.

214
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:16,315
That has a nice ring to it.

215
00:13:16,481 --> 00:13:18,609
Okay, whoa, come on.

216
00:13:18,775 --> 00:13:20,945
It's better if you ride shotgun...

217
00:13:21,111 --> 00:13:26,491
...because we don't wanna have
a car crash on our first real day together.

218
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:34,082
Okay, come here. Come here.

219
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,961
It's a big day. You can ride over here.

220
00:13:37,128 --> 00:13:40,923
Maybe it's okay today,
just this one time.

221
00:13:42,674 --> 00:13:48,139
If we get pulled over, we explain.
We explain what the circumstances are.

222
00:13:55,354 --> 00:13:58,274
- What happened?
- The Millers got robbed.

223
00:13:58,441 --> 00:14:01,693
Again? Good thing I got a watchdog.

224
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,278
Hey, buddy.

225
00:14:03,446 --> 00:14:05,947
- He's got some teeth.
Oh, yeah.

226
00:14:06,532 --> 00:14:07,950
I'll just get him some water.

227
00:14:08,116 --> 00:14:10,202
You're not gonna keep him
in the backyard.

228
00:14:10,369 --> 00:14:13,163
Gonna keep him in the garage
till I get him housetrained.

229
00:14:13,581 --> 00:14:15,041
Hmm.

230
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:18,336
Marley, no, no. Marley, Marley, Marley.
Oh, no.

231
00:14:20,379 --> 00:14:24,133
Hey, you've had enough food, Marley.
You've had two bowls of kibble.

232
00:14:24,299 --> 00:14:27,385
You had half a seat belt in the car.

233
00:14:30,722 --> 00:14:33,267
How are you still eating?

234
00:14:36,729 --> 00:14:39,231
I don't understand where you can put it.

235
00:14:39,398 --> 00:14:43,778
And here's the little box
where Marley is going to bunk down.

236
00:14:43,945 --> 00:14:47,240
Pretty cozy. All right, good night.

237
00:14:51,911 --> 00:14:55,789
You're gonna be okay.
I'm just right inside.

238
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:58,543
Sleep tight.

239
00:15:26,946 --> 00:15:28,990
All right.

240
00:15:30,575 --> 00:15:35,288
Come on, Marley.
You're killing me, you know that?

241
00:15:51,303 --> 00:15:55,765
Oh, we've got some cleaning up to do
before the missus gets back.

242
00:15:56,642 --> 00:15:58,144
All right.

243
00:15:58,311 --> 00:16:03,691
I'm off to the airport, and you're gonna
ride out the rain right in your little box.

244
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,068
Just a little thunder.

245
00:16:08,153 --> 00:16:09,197
Back in a flash.

246
00:16:35,932 --> 00:16:36,974
Hi.
- Get in here.

247
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,725
Oh, my God.

248
00:16:41,312 --> 00:16:43,355
- Hi.
- How are you?

249
00:16:43,523 --> 00:16:44,856
- How's my puppy?
- I'm okay.

250
00:16:45,024 --> 00:16:48,945
A little tired, but I'm trying to stay dry.

251
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:51,530
- Really, how is he?
- He's waiting for you.

252
00:17:04,669 --> 00:17:09,339
Do you hear that? Is that...?
I think that's Marley.

253
00:17:16,556 --> 00:17:20,308
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Look at this.

254
00:17:21,184 --> 00:17:23,980
- This is not how I left it.
- How long did you leave him here?

255
00:17:24,145 --> 00:17:27,316
I left him for maybe an hour, tops.
Did he eat the dry wall?

256
00:17:28,901 --> 00:17:33,280
- Oh, that's not right.
- That's... One little dog did that.

257
00:17:33,447 --> 00:17:35,991
Oh, honey, you're shaking.

258
00:17:36,157 --> 00:17:39,327
Does thunder scare you, mister?

259
00:17:40,413 --> 00:17:42,163
Sweet boy.

260
00:17:42,582 --> 00:17:44,666
Oh, look at us.

261
00:17:45,334 --> 00:17:46,544
Oh.

262
00:17:46,877 --> 00:17:50,256
So I'm in this cave,
and I can feel the machine guns.

263
00:17:50,423 --> 00:17:52,215
There's like nine of them around me.

264
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:54,885
- What, like AK-47s?
- Kalashnikovs.

265
00:17:55,051 --> 00:17:56,846
- Then Escobar comes in and says...
- Escobar?

266
00:17:58,346 --> 00:18:02,018
Yeah, he says,
"I read your piece on Qaddafi...

267
00:18:02,184 --> 00:18:05,104
...and I think
you captured his narcissism perfectly. "

268
00:18:06,105 --> 00:18:08,857
- Can you believe that?
- Some of it.

269
00:18:09,317 --> 00:18:10,776
I wish you could've been there.

270
00:18:10,942 --> 00:18:14,614
But who's gonna cover the power struggle
down at the Rotary club in Delray?

271
00:18:14,779 --> 00:18:17,032
Oh, it's been just crazy.

272
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:19,785
- Your time will come, amigo.
- I'll drink to that.

273
00:18:19,951 --> 00:18:22,872
That was crazy. Oh, my God.

274
00:18:24,664 --> 00:18:27,084
- Oh, my God.
- That is the cutest thing I've ever seen.

275
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,544
Say hello, Marley.

276
00:18:28,711 --> 00:18:30,922
Can I hold him?
- Of course. Here you go.

277
00:18:31,087 --> 00:18:33,715
You're so cute.
- Oh, I love their puppy breath.

278
00:18:33,883 --> 00:18:35,675
- Ahem.
- Oh.

279
00:18:35,843 --> 00:18:37,970
Have you guys met
my buddy Sebastian?

280
00:18:38,136 --> 00:18:39,763
Sebastian, Viviana. Nice to meet you.

281
00:18:39,931 --> 00:18:41,223
Hi.
- Hi, I'm Shannon.

282
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:43,476
- Hey, he's a beauty, isn't he?
He's adorable.

283
00:18:43,643 --> 00:18:46,979
I actually think the
"puppy instead of a baby" idea is working.

284
00:18:47,145 --> 00:18:48,897
Yeah, it's certainly working for me.

285
00:18:49,065 --> 00:18:51,651
Can I take him home?
You're so cute, yes, you are.

286
00:18:51,817 --> 00:18:55,278
I can't let you have the puppy, but
you might have a shot with the big dog.

287
00:18:55,445 --> 00:18:56,822
- Oh, yeah?
- I'm easy.

288
00:18:56,989 --> 00:18:59,825
Oh, you're easy?
- And I do tricks. I'm paper-trained.

289
00:19:02,327 --> 00:19:03,954
Oh, no, no.

290
00:19:04,121 --> 00:19:05,163
Oh, my God.
Marley.

291
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:07,500
- Marley!
Come back, puppy.

292
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:09,125
Marley! Marley!

293
00:19:16,717 --> 00:19:18,344
Marley!

294
00:19:19,135 --> 00:19:20,930
Marley! Marley!

295
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:30,189
- Marley!
- Marley!

296
00:19:37,404 --> 00:19:39,824
Got him. Thanks.
- You have to be more careful, man.

297
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:43,702
It's our first week together,
so we're still working out the kinks.

298
00:19:43,869 --> 00:19:46,873
You shouldn't bring a dog to
the dog beach until he's trained.

299
00:19:47,038 --> 00:19:48,708
Okay, can I get the dog back?

300
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:52,044
Never let him off leash
unless you have complete confidence.

301
00:19:52,211 --> 00:19:55,338
This is the only beach in two counties
where dogs aren't banned.

302
00:19:55,506 --> 00:19:59,093
Cops see anybody peeing or pooping
down by the water, they'll shut us down.

303
00:19:59,259 --> 00:20:00,303
Heh, heh.

304
00:20:00,469 --> 00:20:01,887
Why is that funny to you?

305
00:20:03,471 --> 00:20:05,223
I'm just very immature.

306
00:20:06,558 --> 00:20:07,934
Calvin!

307
00:20:09,604 --> 00:20:14,232
See? Aren't you glad you're not Calvin?
See how easy you got it?

308
00:20:17,361 --> 00:20:18,403
Marley, stop.

309
00:20:19,529 --> 00:20:21,907
Marley. Marley.

310
00:20:22,532 --> 00:20:24,535
Honey, the dog's got my...

311
00:20:24,701 --> 00:20:26,578
Marley, no.

312
00:20:27,496 --> 00:20:30,708
Marley,
you can't go through a screen door.

313
00:20:41,885 --> 00:20:42,929
Hey, Steve.

314
00:20:43,095 --> 00:20:45,515
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- You too.

315
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,557
Marley.

316
00:20:50,102 --> 00:20:53,814
It just seems like there's other guys.
Don't understand why you thought of me.

317
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:57,276
- I'm in a bind.
- Yeah, but I'm a reporter, not a columnist.

318
00:20:57,442 --> 00:20:59,569
John, you'll get better pay.

319
00:20:59,737 --> 00:21:02,698
You can pick your own hours
and choose your own topics.

320
00:21:03,324 --> 00:21:04,407
Why are you hesitating?

321
00:21:04,575 --> 00:21:06,285
- I'm thinking.
- No, you're hesitating.

322
00:21:06,451 --> 00:21:08,621
I'm offering a promotion,
and you're hesitating.

323
00:21:08,788 --> 00:21:10,789
I never saw myself as a columnist.

324
00:21:10,957 --> 00:21:14,751
Oh, well, think of it as one of those times
when you surprise yourself.

325
00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:15,961
Okay.

326
00:21:16,127 --> 00:21:19,423
It's only a couple of times a week
until I get a replacement for Jerry.

327
00:21:19,589 --> 00:21:22,384
Then you can go back to doing
whatever it was you were doing.

328
00:21:22,551 --> 00:21:26,305
- What were you doing?
- Obituaries, methane leaks.

329
00:21:26,471 --> 00:21:27,973
- Are you okay with this?
- Yes.

330
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,224
You don't seem thrilled.

331
00:21:29,392 --> 00:21:32,310
- No, it's a promotion.
- We can take away the raise if you like.

332
00:21:32,478 --> 00:21:34,438
No, no, I'm... Thank you.

333
00:21:34,605 --> 00:21:36,898
All right, now you're talking.
Go on, get to work.

334
00:21:37,567 --> 00:21:41,278
Marley.
I think he dislocated my shoulder.

335
00:21:41,444 --> 00:21:46,075
He doesn't even heel.
Doesn't walk, he just sprints.

336
00:21:46,659 --> 00:21:49,161
Marley. God.

337
00:21:49,327 --> 00:21:52,205
Marley, stop. Down here. Come on.

338
00:21:52,373 --> 00:21:54,584
I had to pull him off three dogs today.

339
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:57,002
- Poodles?
- Among others.

340
00:21:57,169 --> 00:21:59,337
I say we give him away to a farm.

341
00:21:59,505 --> 00:22:03,049
Isn't that usually what you do
with dogs that are out of control?

342
00:22:03,217 --> 00:22:06,220
Well, usually you train them.

343
00:22:06,386 --> 00:22:08,890
Or you train them.
Come on, down. Come on.

344
00:22:09,056 --> 00:22:10,974
What are you doing?

345
00:22:11,976 --> 00:22:14,186
Arnie gave me a column.

346
00:22:14,353 --> 00:22:17,565
Are you kidding? Baby, that's great.

347
00:22:17,731 --> 00:22:19,025
Oh, yeah, it's a big honor.

348
00:22:19,192 --> 00:22:23,362
I get to write about zoning laws
and give my opinion on yard sales.

349
00:22:23,528 --> 00:22:26,656
Whoa, down, boy.
Easy with the enthusiasm.

350
00:22:26,824 --> 00:22:30,286
No, it's just I don't even read this crap
when other people write it.

351
00:22:30,452 --> 00:22:34,624
Now I'm supposed to, you know,
write two columns a week?

352
00:22:34,789 --> 00:22:37,250
And you've got nothing for Tuesday.

353
00:22:37,417 --> 00:22:42,423
- No, I got nothing for Tuesday.
- I bet you're gonna think of something.

354
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:48,136
See, this gives me a little inspiration,
but it's not for a column. It's more like...

355
00:22:48,471 --> 00:22:50,806
Look at Marley.
Now he's eating the floor.

356
00:22:50,972 --> 00:22:53,058
Marley, stop.

357
00:22:53,851 --> 00:22:55,769
Marley, you're incorrigible.

358
00:22:55,936 --> 00:23:00,650
"Incorrigible. " I don't believe in that word.
Every dog wants to learn.

359
00:23:00,816 --> 00:23:02,609
Hey, come here, baby.

360
00:23:02,777 --> 00:23:07,198
Yes, you're a good girl.
You're a good girl, yes, you are.

361
00:23:07,365 --> 00:23:10,242
Of course, they can't learn
if their parents are weak-willed.

362
00:23:10,409 --> 00:23:12,827
Yeah, well,
I'm pretty strong-willed, but...

363
00:23:13,328 --> 00:23:16,332
- Marley. Sorry.
- Say hello to Marley.

364
00:23:16,499 --> 00:23:18,750
So which of you is gonna be the trainer?

365
00:23:18,917 --> 00:23:21,878
We both thought we would.
We'd like him to listen to both of us.

366
00:23:22,046 --> 00:23:23,213
We're married, so yeah.

367
00:23:23,381 --> 00:23:26,259
No, no, no.
A dog can only have one master.

368
00:23:26,424 --> 00:23:28,928
Which one of you
has the most natural authority...

369
00:23:29,095 --> 00:23:30,596
...in your own relationship?

370
00:23:31,972 --> 00:23:34,392
Well, maybe I'll stand over there
for the beginning.

371
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:36,560
I thought so. Shall we?

372
00:23:38,895 --> 00:23:41,941
Jeez.
- All right. Sit.

373
00:23:42,107 --> 00:23:43,192
Sit.
Sit.

374
00:23:43,358 --> 00:23:44,402
Sit... Oof.

375
00:23:45,569 --> 00:23:48,905
Sit. Marley. Okay, Marley. Marley, sit.

376
00:23:49,073 --> 00:23:52,242
This, class, is a classic example...

377
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:55,954
...of a dog who has foolishly
been allowed to believe...

378
00:23:56,122 --> 00:23:59,625
...he is the alpha male of the pack.

379
00:23:59,791 --> 00:24:02,711
And therefore,
he can never be a happy animal.

380
00:24:02,878 --> 00:24:05,213
Yeah, he looks pretty miserable.

381
00:24:05,631 --> 00:24:07,924
You, joker.

382
00:24:08,425 --> 00:24:11,636
Rotate in. And lose the sunglasses.

383
00:24:11,804 --> 00:24:13,722
A dog likes to be looked at in the eye.

384
00:24:15,724 --> 00:24:16,976
- I got it. Okay.
- Okay.

385
00:24:17,143 --> 00:24:18,644
- You got him? Okay.
- Yep.

386
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:20,980
So collar your dogs.

387
00:24:23,607 --> 00:24:24,942
Good boy.

388
00:24:26,611 --> 00:24:30,990
All right, dogs on the left.
On the count of three.

389
00:24:31,156 --> 00:24:34,117
One, two, three. Let's go.

390
00:24:34,701 --> 00:24:35,744
Walk. Walk.

391
00:24:35,912 --> 00:24:36,996
Very nice.
Heel.

392
00:24:37,579 --> 00:24:39,832
- Go.
Very good.

393
00:24:40,583 --> 00:24:42,460
Good.

394
00:24:42,835 --> 00:24:46,756
Hey.
Correct him. Rein in that dog.

395
00:24:46,923 --> 00:24:50,926
All right. All right, class.
Come on, let's line up again.

396
00:24:51,635 --> 00:24:56,641
Class, it's a simple question of
having confidence in your own authority.

397
00:24:56,807 --> 00:25:01,144
I shall now demonstrate a simple walk,
all right?

398
00:25:01,561 --> 00:25:03,564
Come here.
Mr. Grogan.

399
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:05,942
- Sorry.
- May I?

400
00:25:06,107 --> 00:25:11,029
All right, even an unruly dog
likes to obey his leader.

401
00:25:11,696 --> 00:25:14,991
Marley, heel.

402
00:25:17,202 --> 00:25:18,663
There.

403
00:25:18,828 --> 00:25:24,210
Marley. Marley. Marley! Marley!

404
00:25:26,378 --> 00:25:28,297
Marley.

405
00:25:35,637 --> 00:25:37,181
Careful. Marley, no! Marley!

406
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:46,691
- Are you okay?
- That's it. He is out.

407
00:25:46,857 --> 00:25:51,903
- He usually only does this with poodles.
- That dog is a bad influence on the others.

408
00:25:52,904 --> 00:25:55,825
No. Leg humping is like a virus.

409
00:25:55,991 --> 00:25:58,661
Once it takes hold of the group... No.

410
00:25:58,827 --> 00:26:01,204
Okay.
- He has got to go.

411
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:04,250
It was maybe your hair.

412
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:05,750
It reminded him of a poodle.

413
00:26:05,917 --> 00:26:09,087
- Never bring him back.
- Okay.

414
00:26:09,462 --> 00:26:11,798
Right from the beginning,
she had me in her sights.

415
00:26:11,965 --> 00:26:14,885
- I know, she really did.
- Marley wouldn't take any of her crap.

416
00:26:15,051 --> 00:26:20,223
That's why he got kicked out.
You are now the world's worst dog.

417
00:26:20,391 --> 00:26:22,434
You've been kicked out
of obedience school.

418
00:26:22,602 --> 00:26:25,438
You know,
there is something else that we could do.

419
00:26:25,605 --> 00:26:28,607
No, I know, we just... We get an...

420
00:26:30,108 --> 00:26:32,653
No, no, no.

421
00:26:32,819 --> 00:26:35,280
I'm smiling, but I'm serious. No.

422
00:26:36,907 --> 00:26:41,871
It's not gonna be so bad, buddy.
You'll see. Sex is overrated.

423
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:47,125
I can't tell you that,
because you know it's a lie.

424
00:26:47,292 --> 00:26:49,211
Poor son of a bitch.

425
00:26:49,377 --> 00:26:52,964
Okay, you wanna come up?
Yeah, that's the least I can do.

426
00:26:53,633 --> 00:26:55,259
- Get a little fresh air.
- Marley.

427
00:26:56,009 --> 00:26:59,221
Oh, gosh,
it's like he's walking the plank.

428
00:26:59,387 --> 00:27:01,348
That's what breaks my heart.
He's so happy.

429
00:27:01,516 --> 00:27:04,809
- He doesn't know what's coming.
- Honey, he's gonna be fine.

430
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:09,815
- Oh, no, no, now I'm getting nervous.
- He's okay. He's just getting a little air.

431
00:27:14,403 --> 00:27:15,946
It's like Of Mice and Men.

432
00:27:16,989 --> 00:27:19,491
- Whoa, Marley.
- Oh! John, please, grab him.

433
00:27:21,117 --> 00:27:23,162
- Oh, my God.
- He's making a break for it.

434
00:27:23,328 --> 00:27:25,914
- Marley!
- He's onto our evil plan.

435
00:27:26,082 --> 00:27:28,166
- Pull over.
- I can't stop here. I can't.

436
00:27:28,334 --> 00:27:32,296
- Honey, pull over.
- I'm trying to. There's a ton of traffic.

437
00:27:35,633 --> 00:27:38,426
- Come on, pull over.
- All right, all right, all right.

438
00:27:40,262 --> 00:27:41,430
Oh, jeez.

439
00:27:41,596 --> 00:27:43,807
- I need a little help here.
- I know.

440
00:27:43,974 --> 00:27:45,433
- Hey. Get a leash.
Oh, shut up.

441
00:27:45,601 --> 00:27:49,480
Hey, he's losing his balls today.
Cut him some slack.

442
00:27:49,646 --> 00:27:51,606
- Got him? Careful, careful.
- I got him.

443
00:27:57,864 --> 00:28:02,034
And this is a rough draft because I want...
I'd like to take another pass at it.

444
00:28:05,538 --> 00:28:07,373
The beginning, I think I might wanna...

445
00:28:07,539 --> 00:28:11,294
I think we can maybe lose that
because I think it gets a little bit jokey.

446
00:28:13,128 --> 00:28:15,381
I just reread it.
I didn't think it worked at all.

447
00:28:15,548 --> 00:28:18,217
- I'm sorry. I'm gonna do the zoning piece.
- Wait a minute.

448
00:28:18,384 --> 00:28:21,554
What are you apologizing for?
This stuff is hysterical.

449
00:28:21,721 --> 00:28:24,182
- Really?
- I'm laughing my head off at this.

450
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,435
Getting kicked out of obedience school,
the humping, the great escape.

451
00:28:28,603 --> 00:28:31,480
That's really funny stuff.
I'm laughing my ass off.

452
00:28:31,646 --> 00:28:35,401
It's hysterical stuff. Run it the way it is.

453
00:28:37,694 --> 00:28:39,529
Thanks.

454
00:28:39,697 --> 00:28:42,700
Listen, you know what makes it work?

455
00:28:42,866 --> 00:28:45,243
What makes it work
is that you put yourself into it.

456
00:28:45,411 --> 00:28:47,038
- I like that.
- Good.

457
00:28:47,204 --> 00:28:49,080
Look, I know you're a reporter and all...

458
00:28:49,248 --> 00:28:51,416
...but could you do a few more like this?

459
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:52,919
- Sure.
- Great.

460
00:28:53,085 --> 00:28:56,547
- Okay, great.
- And tell your dog not to feel too bad.

461
00:28:56,713 --> 00:28:59,674
Sooner or later, we all lose our balls.

462
00:28:59,842 --> 00:29:02,135
Right. Good to know.

463
00:29:23,782 --> 00:29:27,118
Woke up to a kiss from Marley.
Went for a walk that turned into a run.

00:29:34,876 --> 00:29:38,798
Watched him steal some guy's Frisbee.
Bought new Frisbee. Gave Marley a bath.

468
00:29:38,964 --> 00:29:42,551
Went to work with writer's block.
Hoped for inspiration to strike, nada.

469
00:29:42,718 --> 00:29:46,055
Got a new shirt. Got a new keyboard.
Got the same old paycheck.

00:29:59,652 --> 00:30:02,153
Went shopping.
Bought a Sharper Image pillow.

476
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:06,157
Slept like a baby. Caught Marley eating
the pillow. Hid the evidence from Jenny.

Cleaned up Marley's vomit.
Helped Jenny make dinner.

Went running with Marley
to burn off frustration.

Didn't see him chew the leash.

495
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:02,256
Spent Christmas with Jen's sister
and family in Orlando.

496
00:31:02,423 --> 00:31:04,717
Left Marley at their house
to go to Disney World.

497
00:31:04,884 --> 00:31:06,635
Had to buy them new baby furniture.

498
00:31:06,801 --> 00:31:09,846
Saw Jen light up around the girls.
Got a flat driving home.

499
00:31:10,013 --> 00:31:12,849
Wrote a column about state troopers.
Wrote about tollbooths.

500
00:31:13,017 --> 00:31:16,686
Went to dinner to celebrate Jenny's raise.
Tied Marley to the table.

501
00:31:19,272 --> 00:31:20,398
Marley, come here.

502
00:31:20,566 --> 00:31:21,983
Chased Marley and the table.

503
00:31:22,151 --> 00:31:25,028
Caught the table.
Wrote about Marley pulling the table.

504
00:31:25,195 --> 00:31:28,240
Tried to write a column
about anything but Marley, nada.

505
00:31:28,406 --> 00:31:30,701
Picked oranges from our tree.
Made orange juice.

506
00:31:30,867 --> 00:31:34,204
Drove down to Miami for Bark
in the Park night at the Marlins game.

507
00:31:34,372 --> 00:31:36,414
Brought Marley,
who turned out to be a fan.

508
00:31:36,582 --> 00:31:38,917
Tried to stop him chasing a ball
in the stands.

509
00:31:39,085 --> 00:31:42,505
Tried to stop him chasing a ball
on the field. Wrote about the ball game.

510
00:31:42,672 --> 00:31:45,383
Took crap from Sebastian about it.
Met his new girlfriend.

511
00:31:45,549 --> 00:31:48,677
Can't remember her name.
Went snorkeling. Cut my leg on coral.

512
00:31:48,845 --> 00:31:51,596
Went to the emergency room.
Wrote a column about hospitals.

513
00:31:51,763 --> 00:31:54,432
Went to an Easter-egg hunt
at Jenny's boss's in Boca.

514
00:31:54,599 --> 00:31:58,061
Drank mimosas. Met a doctor
who does three liposuctions a day.

515
00:31:58,229 --> 00:32:01,857
Wrote a column about nannies in Boca.
Wrote a column about women of Boca.

516
00:32:02,607 --> 00:32:04,402
Wrote a column about writing columns.

517
00:32:04,777 --> 00:32:07,113
Came home to find Jenny dancing
with Marley.

518
00:32:10,782 --> 00:32:14,161
Tried to think of reasons
not to have a baby now...

519
00:32:14,327 --> 00:32:15,997
...nada.

520
00:32:18,915 --> 00:32:20,792
Why don't you just let him off the leash?

521
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,212
Because although I love him,
I don't trust him.

522
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:26,590
It's been two years.
He's never had an accident.

523
00:32:26,757 --> 00:32:28,342
Because I never let him off leash.

524
00:32:28,509 --> 00:32:32,430
We're not gonna be the guys who get
Dog Beach shut down, are we, Marley?

525
00:32:32,596 --> 00:32:33,722
Nope.

526
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,226
Okay, so, what's next?

527
00:32:37,393 --> 00:32:38,853
Um...

528
00:32:39,019 --> 00:32:41,314
- Ice cream?
- No, I mean on your list.

529
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,940
- My list?
- Jen, the list.

530
00:32:43,106 --> 00:32:46,152
Your play list you had when
we got married that had the game plan.

531
00:32:46,318 --> 00:32:48,528
- It was basically my marching orders.
- My plan?

532
00:32:48,695 --> 00:32:52,490
Your plan. I wanna know what's next.
Scare me.

533
00:32:52,657 --> 00:32:55,076
You really wanna know?
- Hit me.

534
00:32:55,243 --> 00:32:58,455
Well, it's a tossup between a new roof...

535
00:32:58,623 --> 00:32:59,749
Very practical.

536
00:33:00,499 --> 00:33:01,750
- And, uh...

537
00:33:01,917 --> 00:33:03,752
And a baby.

538
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:14,012
I could live with a few leaks.

539
00:33:14,513 --> 00:33:17,016
- Really?
- Yeah, a couple.

540
00:33:17,182 --> 00:33:19,852
But you know, a couple leaks
turn into maybe one big leak.

541
00:33:20,019 --> 00:33:22,980
And then that big leak
becomes a very big responsibility.

542
00:33:23,146 --> 00:33:24,190
That's true.

543
00:33:24,356 --> 00:33:27,359
We may wanna think about
fixing a lot of things before we start...

544
00:33:27,527 --> 00:33:28,903
Well, we already fixed Marley.

545
00:33:29,069 --> 00:33:32,531
If we fix too many more things,
I think this conversation becomes moot.

546
00:33:32,698 --> 00:33:35,326
John, are you serious?

547
00:33:35,492 --> 00:33:37,869
Yeah. I think so.

548
00:33:38,037 --> 00:33:40,498
You realize we're not talking
about an actual roof?

549
00:33:40,664 --> 00:33:43,667
Yes, I got that.
About halfway through, I picked it up.

550
00:33:43,834 --> 00:33:44,961
Good metaphor, though.

551
00:33:45,126 --> 00:33:48,047
You're not just saying this
because it'll lead to funny columns?

552
00:33:48,213 --> 00:33:51,467
Well, I mean, honey, come on.
I mean, if I get some funny columns...

553
00:33:51,634 --> 00:33:54,220
...that's collateral damage
I think we can live with.

554
00:33:54,386 --> 00:33:57,390
I mean, I'm ready. I mean, if you are.

555
00:33:58,098 --> 00:33:59,724
Instead of trying to have a baby...

556
00:33:59,892 --> 00:34:04,063
...why don't we just stop
trying not to have one?

557
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:06,941
Okay, if I'm following you correctly,
and I think I am...

558
00:34:07,107 --> 00:34:10,485
...this is the part where we head back,
we take it off, and we get it on.

559
00:34:10,652 --> 00:34:13,447
Yes, but you'll...
It'll have a little more romance than that.

560
00:34:13,614 --> 00:34:15,949
Yeah, we'll get some candles, some Sade.
Of course.

561
00:34:16,117 --> 00:34:17,577
- Come on.
- Sade.

562
00:34:23,623 --> 00:34:24,666
- Honey?
- Yeah.

563
00:34:24,833 --> 00:34:27,128
Did you have kibble today?

564
00:34:27,295 --> 00:34:29,297
Marley, come on. Marley, go.

565
00:34:29,463 --> 00:34:31,590
He's a dog.
He won't know what he's looking at.

566
00:34:31,757 --> 00:34:34,260
Trust me, he knows,
and he resents the hell out of me.

567
00:34:34,427 --> 00:34:36,971
- Go on, Marley. You have to go.
- Oh, baby, please focus.

568
00:34:37,137 --> 00:34:38,972
Okay, you're right.

569
00:34:44,228 --> 00:34:47,523
Good. Good.
It's even better than the last one.

570
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:49,692
- Thank you.
- You're very good, Gorgan.

571
00:34:50,318 --> 00:34:53,570
I like that piece you did in Boca
on the woman. What did you call her?

572
00:34:53,737 --> 00:34:55,280
- Bocahontas.
- Bocahontas.

573
00:34:55,447 --> 00:34:57,657
Is that true?
She had her boobs done four times?

574
00:34:57,824 --> 00:35:00,119
- That's what she said.
- Hysterical.

575
00:35:00,286 --> 00:35:03,121
And is that true about you and your wife
trying to have a kid?

576
00:35:03,289 --> 00:35:06,541
Well, you know, we're not really trying,
because we don't wanna...

577
00:35:06,708 --> 00:35:08,460
- How does that work?
- What do you mean?

578
00:35:08,628 --> 00:35:10,755
- Well, I mean, are you having sex?
- Yeah.

579
00:35:10,922 --> 00:35:13,007
- Did you pull the goalie?
- Yeah.

580
00:35:13,173 --> 00:35:16,969
Then you're trying. Congratulations.
Good work.

581
00:35:17,469 --> 00:35:19,847
You're not "trying" trying.
- Oh, yeah.

582
00:35:20,014 --> 00:35:22,474
Of course, you'd know that
if you ever read my column.

583
00:35:22,641 --> 00:35:25,644
All due respect,
but does anybody ever read your column?

584
00:35:25,811 --> 00:35:29,356
Come on, I bring Marley here to help you
run your game on these poor girls...

585
00:35:29,523 --> 00:35:31,067
...and this is the thanks we get.

586
00:35:31,483 --> 00:35:34,195
- How long you been at it?
- A few months.

587
00:35:34,362 --> 00:35:37,114
- What changed your mind?
- Well, here's the thing.

588
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:42,494
I'm actually married to someone,
and I care about what she wants.

589
00:35:42,661 --> 00:35:45,998
- Well, is it what you want?
- Yeah.

590
00:35:46,498 --> 00:35:50,503
- I guess that answers my other question.
- Yeah?

591
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:54,507
I'm about to do a piece on the growth
of the domestic drug trade for The Times.

592
00:35:54,673 --> 00:35:56,592
You're freelancing
for The New York Times?

593
00:35:56,759 --> 00:36:00,387
Yeah, yeah, but it's a big story,
too big for one guy...

594
00:36:00,554 --> 00:36:02,974
...and I was hoping you'd write it
with me.

595
00:36:04,516 --> 00:36:06,518
Are you kidding me?

596
00:36:06,686 --> 00:36:09,856
- It would be a chance to work together.
- Yeah, I would love that.

597
00:36:10,021 --> 00:36:12,733
Of course, it will be a lot of work,
a lot of travel.

598
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,693
I would hope so.

599
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:18,322
Maybe not the best job for,
uh, somebody with a kid on the way.

600
00:36:19,364 --> 00:36:23,494
Well, that's not necessarily happening
right this very second. Let me talk it ov...

601
00:36:25,246 --> 00:36:26,496
There she is.

602
00:36:27,164 --> 00:36:29,708
- Honey, how are you?
Hi.

603
00:36:29,876 --> 00:36:33,670
I'm just calling to let you know
that there is a naked woman in your bed.

604
00:36:33,838 --> 00:36:37,425
Why don't the two of you get started,
and I'll be there as soon as I can?

605
00:36:37,592 --> 00:36:42,346
Oh, ha. That's very funny.
But seriously, can you come home now?

606
00:36:45,807 --> 00:36:48,936
Hey. We're home.

607
00:36:49,103 --> 00:36:50,980
Hi.

608
00:36:52,023 --> 00:36:53,106
You know the baby thing?

609
00:36:53,273 --> 00:36:55,985
I've been thinking
maybe we should take a break.

610
00:36:57,903 --> 00:36:59,237
You know?

611
00:36:59,405 --> 00:37:01,157
I mean, obviously it's not working...

612
00:37:01,324 --> 00:37:05,744
...and maybe it's nature's way
of saying now's not the right timing.

613
00:37:07,871 --> 00:37:11,583
I mean, maybe it's a sign
that we're not quite ready for this, that...

614
00:37:11,751 --> 00:37:14,753
- I mean, have we really thought this...?
- John.

615
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:16,213
I'm pregnant.

616
00:37:18,507 --> 00:37:20,259
- Great.
- Mm-hm.

617
00:37:20,425 --> 00:37:21,969
Wow.

618
00:37:22,135 --> 00:37:24,262
- Great. Really?
- Yeah.

619
00:37:24,429 --> 00:37:26,349
- Yes.
- You were just saying...?

620
00:37:26,516 --> 00:37:30,101
No, don't worry, that was like...
It sounds so awkward now.

621
00:37:30,268 --> 00:37:35,148
Like I just had this, like, very, you know,
idiotic soliloquy that doesn't apply...

622
00:37:35,315 --> 00:37:37,193
...and I'm really excited.

623
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,570
- Do you wanna start over?
- I would love to.

624
00:37:39,737 --> 00:37:42,072
- That would be great. Can we? Good.
- By all means.

625
00:37:46,369 --> 00:37:49,746
- I'm pregnant.
- What? No! Yes!

626
00:37:52,541 --> 00:37:55,378
- Don't make the same mistake I did.
- What?

627
00:37:55,545 --> 00:37:59,590
There's gonna come a time very soon
where her ankles are gonna swell up.

628
00:37:59,757 --> 00:38:01,007
No, no, I'm ready for that.

629
00:38:01,175 --> 00:38:03,177
She's gonna have blotches
all over her face.

630
00:38:03,344 --> 00:38:05,137
- Yeah.
- She'll be 40 pounds overweight.

631
00:38:05,304 --> 00:38:08,099
- She'll be throwing up all the time.
- I'm not ready for that.

632
00:38:08,266 --> 00:38:12,353
She's gonna look at you and say,
"You bastard. You did this to me. "

633
00:38:12,519 --> 00:38:15,188
What happened to the glow,
the, you know, the...?

634
00:38:15,356 --> 00:38:16,815
There's no glow.

635
00:38:16,983 --> 00:38:20,235
Get her a gift.
That will dissipate some of the anger.

636
00:38:20,402 --> 00:38:22,153
Some earrings, a bracelet.

637
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,992
That's thoughtful. That's a good idea.
In fact, maybe I'll get on it right now.

638
00:38:26,157 --> 00:38:29,119
There's a jewelry store on the corner.
Mention my name.

639
00:38:31,664 --> 00:38:33,833
Oh, John.

640
00:38:34,666 --> 00:38:36,501
It's just beautiful.

641
00:38:36,668 --> 00:38:39,672
It's just beautiful.

642
00:38:39,838 --> 00:38:41,923
- Honey, thank you.
- You're welcome.

643
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:44,217
I was just walking by
just thinking of you...

644
00:38:44,385 --> 00:38:47,179
...and I saw that in the window and I go,
"I'm getting this. "

645
00:38:47,346 --> 00:38:50,266
- That's so sweet.
- Yeah, well...

646
00:38:50,432 --> 00:38:51,684
- Do you like it?
- I love it.

647
00:38:51,851 --> 00:38:54,603
Put it on. Or let me put it on.
I think it's better luck.

648
00:38:54,769 --> 00:38:58,690
- Where'd it go? I just had it.
- You just set it down. Did you drop it?

649
00:38:58,858 --> 00:39:02,027
- No, I put it right here.
- Well, it didn't just disappear.

650
00:39:02,195 --> 00:39:04,030
Oh, God.

651
00:39:06,699 --> 00:39:10,452
- Marley. No, Marley, spit it out.
- No, go to the kitchen, go to the kitchen.

652
00:39:10,619 --> 00:39:15,333
Okay. No, no, no.
Marley, I have a treat. Come here.

653
00:39:16,458 --> 00:39:19,545
Stay. Marley, stay.

654
00:39:19,711 --> 00:39:22,632
Good boy. Yeah.

655
00:39:27,594 --> 00:39:29,222
Marley!
Good going, honey.

656
00:39:31,932 --> 00:39:33,559
Marley.

657
00:39:34,726 --> 00:39:36,228
Come here, Marley.

658
00:39:38,648 --> 00:39:39,731
Jeez.

659
00:39:43,443 --> 00:39:45,362
- Okay, okay. Marley, drop it.
Marley.

660
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:47,864
Gross. Is it there?
Marley.

661
00:39:48,032 --> 00:39:49,992
Oh, honey, I don't see it.

662
00:39:53,579 --> 00:39:56,248
Marley, you've gotta lay off
the mangoes.

663
00:39:57,291 --> 00:40:00,378
You know, years ago,
when I imagined my life...

664
00:40:00,545 --> 00:40:03,547
...somehow standing in the backyard
hosing down your crap...

665
00:40:03,713 --> 00:40:08,094
...looking for my wife's swallowed,
recycled, ass-kissing gift...

666
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:09,971
...never jumped to mind.

667
00:40:10,137 --> 00:40:13,932
Which shows you've gotta dream big
because... Ooh, jackpot.

668
00:40:14,266 --> 00:40:18,938
My, that's a lovely necklace.
It's so shiny.

669
00:40:19,105 --> 00:40:23,275
- Yes, it is.
- And how's that crazy dog of yours?

670
00:40:23,442 --> 00:40:26,362
- I read your columns every week.
Oh.

671
00:40:26,528 --> 00:40:28,739
- So you're the one.
I am.

672
00:40:28,905 --> 00:40:30,907
You'll get a kick
out of next week's column.

673
00:40:31,074 --> 00:40:33,494
The heartbeat will be very fast,
like a little train.

674
00:40:33,661 --> 00:40:36,454
- That's normal.
- Is it too early to tell the sex?

675
00:40:36,621 --> 00:40:38,291
I... Not that I care.

676
00:40:38,456 --> 00:40:41,918
It can be male, female,
whatever sex he wants.

677
00:40:42,503 --> 00:40:45,755
Unambiguous genitalia
if I had my druthers, but...

678
00:40:45,922 --> 00:40:48,009
Shh. Hang on.

679
00:40:50,385 --> 00:40:52,179
Sometimes you can't hear it.

680
00:40:52,346 --> 00:40:54,974
- You're 10 weeks, right?
- Monday I'll be 10 weeks.

681
00:40:55,141 --> 00:40:59,478
Hmm, well, it might be a little too early
for that. Let's go right to the sonogram.

682
00:40:59,644 --> 00:41:01,146
Did you bring your blank tape?

683
00:41:01,313 --> 00:41:03,733
- Oh, yes.
- Yes, yes.

684
00:41:04,608 --> 00:41:06,235
- That's warm.
Mm-hm.

685
00:41:06,402 --> 00:41:08,737
- Let's get a good picture for you first.
Okay.

686
00:41:08,905 --> 00:41:11,489
It'll be right up on the monitor here.

687
00:41:18,748 --> 00:41:21,291
Excuse me. I'll be just a minute.

688
00:41:32,552 --> 00:41:34,429
- Hey, guys.
Hi.

689
00:41:34,597 --> 00:41:37,432
Let's take a look at your baby, shall we?

690
00:41:39,809 --> 00:41:41,436
All right.

691
00:41:48,693 --> 00:41:50,278
Is there anything in there?

692
00:41:53,824 --> 00:41:56,117
Not what you would expect to see
at 10 weeks.

693
00:41:56,284 --> 00:41:59,621
- I'm not quite 10 weeks.
Monday.

694
00:41:59,789 --> 00:42:02,916
- It's still, I guess, nine weeks.
Yeah, nine weeks.

695
00:42:05,126 --> 00:42:07,213
There's no heartbeat, Jen.

696
00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:11,300
I'm very, very sorry.

697
00:42:11,842 --> 00:42:14,719
These things, they happen sometimes.
We don't know why, though.

698
00:42:15,721 --> 00:42:19,391
But you're young, you have your health.
Couple months, you guys can try again.

699
00:42:20,601 --> 00:42:23,271
I'm sorry. All right?

700
00:42:23,436 --> 00:42:26,523
I'm gonna leave you alone for a moment,
and then we'll talk more.

701
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:28,650
I'm very sorry.

702
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:52,925
Well, in a couple months,
we can try again, okay?

703
00:43:18,074 --> 00:43:20,119
Want some tea?

704
00:43:23,456 --> 00:43:26,250
Hey, you know what?
I was thinking that we, um...

705
00:43:27,126 --> 00:43:29,295
We still have those tickets
from your parents...

706
00:43:29,461 --> 00:43:31,922
...for the honeymoon in Ireland.

707
00:43:32,297 --> 00:43:36,385
We could finally do that.
Maybe take some time off.

708
00:43:37,929 --> 00:43:39,429
Jenny?

709
00:44:23,849 --> 00:44:27,353
- Oh, he's big.
- Oh, yeah, he's a hundred pounds.

710
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:30,438
- Now, he just wants to say hello here.
- Yeah, he loves people.

711
00:44:30,606 --> 00:44:34,485
Now, just be calm, and you just stay
still. And you're a dog person, right?

712
00:44:34,985 --> 00:44:36,778
- Actually, I'm...
- Ready? Here we go.

713
00:44:36,945 --> 00:44:40,157
Marley, you can say hello. Oh, no, no, no.
No, don't let him do that.

714
00:44:40,324 --> 00:44:41,951
You just knee him if he does that.

715
00:44:42,117 --> 00:44:45,371
It shouldn't happen all the time,
just when you walk through the door.

716
00:44:45,538 --> 00:44:47,664
This will tell you everything
you need to know.

717
00:44:47,831 --> 00:44:51,043
- I've got the bags here.
- You got everything? Okay. Thank you.

718
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:53,963
- All right. Come on, honey.
- Will you get the door?

719
00:44:54,130 --> 00:44:57,007
- Okay, here we are.
Come on, honey, we're really late.

720
00:44:57,592 --> 00:44:59,467
Debby, welcome to our home.

721
00:44:59,635 --> 00:45:02,889
Marley is a spirited dog
who loves interaction.

722
00:45:03,054 --> 00:45:04,472
We've never left him before...

723
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:08,768
...but we are sure he'll behave
just as he does when we're at home.

724
00:45:11,063 --> 00:45:14,358
There are just a few things about Marley
you're gonna need to know.

725
00:45:14,525 --> 00:45:17,027
He eats three times a day.

726
00:45:17,612 --> 00:45:20,072
If he looks starved, feed him again.

727
00:45:21,657 --> 00:45:24,659
Now, of course, all of this food
is gonna have to go somewhere...

728
00:45:24,827 --> 00:45:28,664
...so use the blue pooper-scooper
and watch your step.

729
00:45:28,831 --> 00:45:31,541
Don't worry about the color.
He likes mangoes.

730
00:45:31,708 --> 00:45:34,461
Marley is not allowed
to drink out of the toilet...

731
00:45:34,628 --> 00:45:38,925
...so be sure to keep the lid closed
and the brick on the lid.

732
00:45:39,090 --> 00:45:42,344
Actually, you might wanna just
keep the bathroom door shut in general.

733
00:45:42,512 --> 00:45:45,431
Like most dogs,
Marley needs a lot of exercise...

734
00:45:45,597 --> 00:45:49,893
...so try to take him for a walk or a run
every morning and every evening.

735
00:45:50,061 --> 00:45:52,021
Marley.

736
00:45:52,188 --> 00:45:54,940
Let go, let go, let go. Marley!

737
00:45:55,106 --> 00:45:58,318
And be sure to lock the doors
and windows before you go to sleep.

738
00:45:58,527 --> 00:45:59,820
Shoo. Shoo.

739
00:45:59,987 --> 00:46:02,364
But don't worry,
Marley is an excellent watchdog.

740
00:46:03,782 --> 00:46:07,244
You can rest easy at night
knowing he's on the job.

741
00:46:07,411 --> 00:46:09,539
Thunderstorms are his weak point.

742
00:46:09,704 --> 00:46:12,458
You can give him sedatives
if you think a storm is arriving.

743
00:46:12,625 --> 00:46:15,920
Okay. Here you go.
Marley. Marley, come back here.

744
00:46:16,086 --> 00:46:17,128
He doesn't like them...

745
00:46:17,295 --> 00:46:19,590
...so push them down his throat
as far as they go.

746
00:46:19,965 --> 00:46:22,885
Welcome, welcome. I'm Mrs. Butterly.

747
00:46:23,052 --> 00:46:27,306
Now, finally, we do not allow Marley
to get up on any piece of furniture...

748
00:46:27,472 --> 00:46:30,518
...or chew on anything except his toys.

749
00:46:31,143 --> 00:46:35,106
Other than that, enjoy him.
Love, Jenny and John.

750
00:46:36,231 --> 00:46:39,902
We serve tea every day at 4
and dinner at 6 sharp.

751
00:46:40,318 --> 00:46:44,114
Oh, and these blankets are woolen.
Good heat in them.

752
00:46:44,282 --> 00:46:47,409
- So they're electric?
- Oh, not in this house.

753
00:46:47,577 --> 00:46:50,996
My brother died in a fire,
God rest his soul.

754
00:46:51,664 --> 00:46:53,748
In this room, actually.

755
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:57,878
Oh, not to worry. It's been repapered.

756
00:46:58,045 --> 00:47:01,757
Well, good night to you both,
and God bless you.

757
00:47:01,923 --> 00:47:04,760
Thank you. You... Bless you.

758
00:47:08,764 --> 00:47:10,349
That was just weird.

759
00:47:14,978 --> 00:47:16,521
Oh, gosh.

760
00:47:16,981 --> 00:47:22,195
Honey, I know that we haven't had sex
since, you know...

761
00:47:22,695 --> 00:47:25,280
...but I don't think
we're breaking that streak tonight.

762
00:47:25,447 --> 00:47:29,659
No, I don't wanna break the streak here.
This doesn't feel...

763
00:47:29,827 --> 00:47:36,000
I mean, I think I could, you know,
handle God watching and his mother...

764
00:47:36,166 --> 00:47:40,045
...but not this little porcelain pontiff
right here.

765
00:47:40,463 --> 00:47:43,548
It's July and I think I can see my breath.

766
00:47:43,715 --> 00:47:46,510
- Honey, I can't feel my toes.
- That's not good.

767
00:47:46,677 --> 00:47:50,431
I'm gonna check on that.

768
00:47:52,516 --> 00:47:54,559
- Oh, good God. Shush.
- That's not the bed.

769
00:47:54,726 --> 00:47:59,231
It's the shrieks
of oversexed souls in hell.

770
00:48:01,442 --> 00:48:03,818
Do you wanna join them?

771
00:48:05,445 --> 00:48:07,155
Really?

772
00:48:07,697 --> 00:48:09,157
Mm-hm.

773
00:48:09,699 --> 00:48:11,786
We don't have to.

774
00:48:11,952 --> 00:48:16,456
I know, but the idea that it hasn't
happened here in 50 years is just...

775
00:48:16,623 --> 00:48:18,751
It's kind of turning me on.

776
00:48:23,130 --> 00:48:25,507
Honey, I missed you.

777
00:48:51,784 --> 00:48:54,661
Marley. Hi, honey.
- Marley.

778
00:48:54,829 --> 00:48:57,706
- Oh, come here. Oh, my God.
- Hi. We missed you so much.

779
00:48:57,873 --> 00:48:59,125
Hey, Debby.
- Hey.

780
00:48:59,291 --> 00:49:01,626
There were 11 thunderstorms
while you were gone.

781
00:49:01,793 --> 00:49:04,755
Eleven. And you were right,
he doesn't like thunderstorms.

782
00:49:04,922 --> 00:49:07,757
Wow. Okay, yeah, 11.
That's a lot of thunderstorms.

783
00:49:07,925 --> 00:49:11,469
Oh, and just so you know,
I am a dog person, but that's not a dog.

784
00:49:11,637 --> 00:49:14,097
That is evil with a dog face
that is humping my leg...

785
00:49:14,264 --> 00:49:16,349
...and peeing on your carpet.

786
00:49:16,516 --> 00:49:19,519
- Marley. Marley.
- Marley, stop that.

787
00:49:25,650 --> 00:49:28,987
Marley, come on, it's just thunder.
No barking.

788
00:49:34,159 --> 00:49:36,244
Marley, come on. It's just thunder.

789
00:49:37,788 --> 00:49:39,623
Marley, come on.

790
00:49:40,916 --> 00:49:42,668
Jenny!

791
00:49:42,835 --> 00:49:44,878
Can you help me out here?

792
00:49:45,045 --> 00:49:48,132
I got 20 minutes to file this column,
and I gotta...

793
00:49:48,298 --> 00:49:49,842
Jenny?

794
00:49:50,717 --> 00:49:53,679
- Ah. The luck of the Irish.
- What?

795
00:51:05,876 --> 00:51:08,420
Oh, God. John. Honey.

796
00:51:08,588 --> 00:51:11,757
John. John, wake up, honey. It's time.

797
00:51:11,923 --> 00:51:16,554
Okay, what do I need? Oh,
these will be comfortable. Okay. Ooh.

798
00:51:16,721 --> 00:51:18,764
You all right? You all right?

799
00:51:18,931 --> 00:51:21,266
Are you okay?
It's okay, I'm not gonna hurt her.

800
00:51:21,434 --> 00:51:23,561
Try not to scream.
I don't want him to kill me.

801
00:51:23,728 --> 00:51:25,813
You remembered
to install the car seat, right?

802
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:27,773
They won't let us take the baby home...

803
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:29,775
- I wouldn't forget.
- I know, I'm sorry.

804
00:51:29,942 --> 00:51:32,737
Got that right there?
- I think I got it. What else?

805
00:51:35,322 --> 00:51:37,449
Yeah, come on, Marley,
help me out here.

806
00:51:38,284 --> 00:51:42,788
You can chew through drywall, Marley.
This is nothing for you.

807
00:51:43,581 --> 00:51:45,458
Good, yeah.

808
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:48,960
No, no, you're gonna stay here.

809
00:51:49,128 --> 00:51:51,672
I'll leave you this bone
to keep you busy now.

810
00:51:51,838 --> 00:51:56,135
Hopefully no thunderstorms.
And I'm off. Let's go.

811
00:52:16,655 --> 00:52:19,115
Who's your daddy? Come here.

812
00:52:29,793 --> 00:52:31,170
Here's the thing.

813
00:52:31,336 --> 00:52:34,172
In about two minutes,
we're gonna bring home the baby...

814
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:39,262
...and you'd be doing me a really big favor
if you didn't freak out.

815
00:52:40,179 --> 00:52:42,974
And I'm gonna try to do the same.

816
00:52:46,936 --> 00:52:48,855
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready, yes.

817
00:52:49,021 --> 00:52:51,273
- Okay.
Hi, come here.

818
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:55,027
Hi, baby. Oh, hi. Hi, sweetie. Hi, Marley.

819
00:52:55,193 --> 00:52:59,782
Oh. Come on. Come here. Okay?

820
00:52:59,949 --> 00:53:04,161
- Marley.
- Would be a bummer if you ate the baby.

821
00:53:07,081 --> 00:53:08,541
Shh.

822
00:53:08,708 --> 00:53:12,711
- Just...
- Look, Marley, this is Patrick.

823
00:53:14,255 --> 00:53:19,050
Not to be confused with a chew toy,
although it may look like one.

824
00:53:19,217 --> 00:53:21,637
Say hi. See, honey?
He's not eating the baby.

825
00:53:22,262 --> 00:53:24,222
Very good.

826
00:53:34,567 --> 00:53:36,568
Yeah. No, I have a quote for it
right here.

827
00:53:36,735 --> 00:53:39,905
Well, have Legal call them again
and get a release for it.

828
00:53:40,072 --> 00:53:42,115
They told me it was on the record.

829
00:53:42,282 --> 00:53:45,244
I don't... Patrick, honey,
be careful with those toys.

830
00:53:45,411 --> 00:53:47,871
You know Marley gets...
Carla, I'm not talking to you.

831
00:53:48,039 --> 00:53:52,251
Will you just call them and get a release?
I'll call you back. I'll call you right back.

832
00:53:52,418 --> 00:53:54,085
Ready?

833
00:53:54,253 --> 00:53:55,420
How far do you wanna go?

834
00:54:12,688 --> 00:54:15,608
Those days are over for us, amigo.

835
00:54:15,775 --> 00:54:18,110
We had a good run, though.

836
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:40,757
Hey, look. There's Daddy.

837
00:54:44,262 --> 00:54:45,304
Come on, Marley.

838
00:54:45,637 --> 00:54:48,266
This is gonna sound crazy,
but what's that thing called...

839
00:54:48,431 --> 00:54:50,393
...when you owe money on a house?

840
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:52,228
- It starts with an M.
- Mortgage.

841
00:54:52,394 --> 00:54:54,021
Mortgage.

842
00:54:54,730 --> 00:54:57,692
Wow. Is it possible to be this tired?

843
00:54:57,858 --> 00:55:00,485
You know what?
I'm gonna get up with him tonight.

844
00:55:00,652 --> 00:55:03,572
No, you won't. You don't hear him.

845
00:55:03,739 --> 00:55:07,451
- Yeah, you're right.
- Yeah, well, why?

846
00:55:07,617 --> 00:55:09,536
I'm just a blessedly sound sleeper.

847
00:55:09,704 --> 00:55:11,998
I do have to go
into the office tomorrow, though.

848
00:55:12,164 --> 00:55:16,043
- Will you watch him then for me?
- It would be my pleasure.

849
00:55:16,210 --> 00:55:20,630
- How long are we talking about?
- I don't know.

850
00:55:20,797 --> 00:55:25,760
- It's not quite what you expected, huh?
- I don't know what I expected.

851
00:55:25,927 --> 00:55:28,347
I never thought Marley
would seem like the easy one.

852
00:55:28,514 --> 00:55:31,309
I know. I know, but you know what?

853
00:55:31,474 --> 00:55:33,853
We adjusted to him...

854
00:55:34,019 --> 00:55:35,980
...and we'll adjust to the baby.

855
00:55:36,146 --> 00:55:39,692
I'm just trying to remember us
from before.

856
00:55:39,858 --> 00:55:43,112
- You mean those, uh, younger...
- Yeah.

857
00:55:43,278 --> 00:55:45,614
...sexier, better-looking people?

858
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:46,907
- Yeah.
- I remember them.

859
00:55:47,074 --> 00:55:50,536
- I remember them vaguely.
- I miss them.

860
00:55:50,911 --> 00:55:52,538
They're here.

861
00:55:52,704 --> 00:55:55,500
They're here, they're just really tired.

862
00:56:00,045 --> 00:56:01,380
What, now you're jealous?

863
00:56:05,175 --> 00:56:06,719
Stay here.

864
00:56:08,094 --> 00:56:10,056
- Call the police.
- Okay.

865
00:56:21,025 --> 00:56:24,402
Hey, hey, hey. Are you all right?
What happened?

866
00:56:24,570 --> 00:56:28,490
He told me not to scream
or he'd stab me, but I screamed.

867
00:56:28,907 --> 00:56:31,994
- I screamed, and he stabbed me.
- Sit down, just sit down.

868
00:56:32,161 --> 00:56:33,913
It's okay, it's all right.

869
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:36,081
- Where's your mother?
- At work.

870
00:56:36,248 --> 00:56:40,418
It's okay, it's not that bad.
Keep your hand placed right here.

871
00:56:40,585 --> 00:56:42,128
Okay.

872
00:56:42,295 --> 00:56:45,590
My wife called the police,
so everything's gonna be okay.

873
00:56:47,592 --> 00:56:50,387
In all the time I've lived here,
I've never gotten your name.

874
00:56:50,554 --> 00:56:54,224
- Lisa.
- Okay, I'm gonna sit right here, Lisa.

875
00:56:54,391 --> 00:56:57,103
You're gonna keep your hands
placed there...

876
00:56:57,269 --> 00:57:00,021
...and we're gonna wait for the police
to get here.

877
00:57:00,188 --> 00:57:03,650
They're gonna take care of this, all right?

878
00:57:03,818 --> 00:57:06,278
Okay? Look at me.

879
00:57:06,445 --> 00:57:08,905
It's all right. It's all right.

880
00:57:09,447 --> 00:57:10,615
Safest neighborhood?

881
00:57:10,782 --> 00:57:13,034
In terms of crime,
I'd say you're looking at Boca.

882
00:57:13,202 --> 00:57:15,871
Boca?
I was afraid you were gonna say that.

883
00:57:16,038 --> 00:57:19,541
- That's the way it is, John.
- Okay, thanks.

884
00:57:21,293 --> 00:57:22,795
Boca. Not so bad.

885
00:57:22,961 --> 00:57:26,340
You got kids playing in the street.
I don't know, what do you guys think?

886
00:57:26,507 --> 00:57:29,677
We might live here one day,
if we can afford it.

887
00:57:29,844 --> 00:57:33,681
There we go. I can get you right here.

888
00:57:35,307 --> 00:57:37,643
Stay. Marley, no.

889
00:57:38,268 --> 00:57:40,353
Marley. Marley.

890
00:57:40,521 --> 00:57:44,108
And don't you love this kitchen?
Look at the state-of-the-art appliances.

891
00:57:44,275 --> 00:57:47,320
And my favorite part, the pool, is...

892
00:57:50,489 --> 00:57:53,367
- Um, why don't we look over here?
- Sorry, can I get a brochure?

893
00:57:53,534 --> 00:57:55,827
- Uh, sure.
- Thank you. Looks nice.

894
00:57:57,954 --> 00:57:59,664
Whose dog is that?

895
00:58:03,168 --> 00:58:04,836
Jenny?

896
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:08,007
Honey.

897
00:58:08,673 --> 00:58:10,175
Jen?

898
00:58:12,802 --> 00:58:15,389
Hey. You okay?

899
00:58:15,556 --> 00:58:19,018
- Yeah, I'm good. Where have you been?
- I wanna show you something.

900
00:58:19,184 --> 00:58:24,606
It's a house. Now, it's a little pricey,
but I think we can do it.

901
00:58:24,773 --> 00:58:26,692
- Boca?
- I know, I know.

902
00:58:26,858 --> 00:58:30,028
But Frank Bennet on the Metro desk
says it's the safest neighborhood.

903
00:58:30,195 --> 00:58:33,449
- I'm just not sure now is the right time.
- But when is the right time?

904
00:58:33,615 --> 00:58:35,701
After one of us gets stabbed
in the driveway?

905
00:58:35,867 --> 00:58:38,496
John.
- Honey, it's cramped in here.

906
00:58:38,663 --> 00:58:40,873
This was supposed to be
a three-year house.

907
00:58:41,039 --> 00:58:42,208
I know. I know that.

908
00:58:42,375 --> 00:58:44,960
I just don't think we can afford
to buy a new one.

909
00:58:45,126 --> 00:58:47,170
But, honey, we can.
With both our salaries...

910
00:58:47,338 --> 00:58:48,463
Honey, I'm pregnant.

911
00:58:49,548 --> 00:58:51,175
Really?

912
00:58:51,884 --> 00:58:53,219
Are you sure?

913
00:58:55,304 --> 00:58:56,722
Come here.

914
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:05,856
Pretty sure.

915
00:59:06,565 --> 00:59:07,608
Four for four.

916
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:10,862
- Hold on.
- That's great.

917
00:59:11,027 --> 00:59:13,155
- Congratulations.
- Uh-huh.

918
00:59:13,322 --> 00:59:15,907
- Come on.
- I mean, to both of us.

919
00:59:16,492 --> 00:59:19,161
Oh, yes. Oh, you're such a good boy.

920
00:59:20,413 --> 00:59:23,583
- Another baby.
- I know.

921
00:59:24,125 --> 00:59:26,085
Honey, I think I have to quit my job.

922
00:59:26,251 --> 00:59:28,461
You don't have to do that.
We can get some help.

923
00:59:28,628 --> 00:59:30,882
No, I don't want any help.
I really don't.

924
00:59:31,047 --> 00:59:33,925
I really... I just don't want...
Will you hand me that pacifier?

925
00:59:34,092 --> 00:59:36,262
I just...
I don't wanna be one of those people...

926
00:59:36,429 --> 00:59:39,264
...that sees their child
for an hour at night.

927
00:59:39,431 --> 00:59:41,641
- I don't.
- I know, but you love your work and...

928
00:59:41,809 --> 00:59:44,686
I do, I love my work, honey,
but this is killing me.

929
00:59:44,853 --> 00:59:47,731
When I'm at the office,
I just wanna be here.

930
00:59:47,898 --> 00:59:51,735
And when I'm here,
I am constantly thinking about work.

931
00:59:51,902 --> 00:59:54,780
And I just know
that I'm doing both jobs halfway.

932
00:59:54,947 --> 00:59:56,740
Well, you're not doing them halfway.

933
00:59:56,907 --> 01:00:02,538
Look, if I have to give up something,
I do not wanna give up this.

934
01:00:02,871 --> 01:00:05,416
Why should I give you a raise?
Give me one good reason.

935
01:00:05,875 --> 01:00:08,960
- Because I'm doing a good job?
- Is that a question?

936
01:00:09,128 --> 01:00:12,465
No, but since I took over the column,
the readership's doubled.

937
01:00:12,632 --> 01:00:14,300
So you are doing a good job.

938
01:00:14,467 --> 01:00:17,469
Yes, if you go by the circulation
and popularity.

939
01:00:17,637 --> 01:00:20,097
Okay. Why not make it permanent?

940
01:00:20,639 --> 01:00:22,474
What do you mean, like forever?

941
01:00:22,641 --> 01:00:25,311
Yeah, that's what "permanent" means.

942
01:00:25,478 --> 01:00:28,981
John, every bozo out there
would like to have their own column.

943
01:00:29,148 --> 01:00:31,108
Everybody in that entire room.

944
01:00:31,275 --> 01:00:34,653
And you've taken the column,
and you've turned it into something fresh.

945
01:00:34,820 --> 01:00:38,449
I know you don't wanna hear it,
but you're a really good columnist.

946
01:00:39,074 --> 01:00:41,409
Why are you hesitating?

947
01:00:41,577 --> 01:00:44,621
I just have this idea about myself,
you know, as a reporter.

948
01:00:44,789 --> 01:00:47,291
Well, sometimes life comes up
with a better idea.

949
01:00:47,458 --> 01:00:48,501
I'll tell you what.

950
01:00:48,668 --> 01:00:52,003
You take on a daily column,
I will double your salary.

951
01:01:35,213 --> 01:01:38,467
Gonna start you off
with some corn flakes.

952
01:01:38,634 --> 01:01:41,094
The most important meal... No, Marley.

953
01:01:41,262 --> 01:01:45,224
Most important meal of the day. There.
I might take a little spoonful.

954
01:01:45,391 --> 01:01:50,188
John, please, just take him for a sec.
I gotta take a shower. I gotta go.

955
01:01:50,353 --> 01:01:51,563
But it happens every time.

956
01:01:51,731 --> 01:01:54,317
Well, you've got to spend more time
with him.

957
01:01:54,733 --> 01:01:56,235
Down.

958
01:01:56,735 --> 01:01:58,195
Marley.

959
01:02:01,615 --> 01:02:03,242
There you go.

960
01:02:03,784 --> 01:02:06,244
- Okay, I'll do it, I'll do it.
- No, no, no, it's fine.

961
01:02:06,411 --> 01:02:10,416
You say to spend more time with him,
and I do, and then you wanna take over.

962
01:02:10,583 --> 01:02:12,710
I don't want you changing him
when you're mad.

963
01:02:12,876 --> 01:02:16,088
- I'm not mad, I'm...
- Thank you. Come on.

964
01:02:16,255 --> 01:02:18,382
Hi, baby. Come on, honey.

965
01:02:18,548 --> 01:02:21,927
Oh, baby. I know, I know.

966
01:02:22,094 --> 01:02:25,764
Oh, watch out. Oh, come on, Conor.
Come on, what?

967
01:02:25,931 --> 01:02:28,141
What's the matter?
What do you need? What is it?

968
01:02:28,309 --> 01:02:31,896
Do you want some food? Food? Milk?

969
01:02:32,063 --> 01:02:34,023
No? Okay.

970
01:02:34,190 --> 01:02:36,775
He's just colicky, Jen.
He'll grow out of it.

971
01:02:36,943 --> 01:02:37,985
Well, here's an idea.

972
01:02:38,152 --> 01:02:41,989
Why don't you stay home, and
I'll go to work while he grows out of it?

973
01:02:42,614 --> 01:02:45,367
Sorry, I'm tired. Just go. Just go.

974
01:02:45,534 --> 01:02:46,869
It's postpartum depression.

975
01:02:47,036 --> 01:02:50,706
They're hormones go on tilt,
and, uh, they get depressed.

976
01:02:50,873 --> 01:02:52,791
I remember
after my fourth kid was born...

977
01:02:52,958 --> 01:02:56,670
...I'd wake up in the middle of the night
sometimes, and my wife would be there...

978
01:02:56,838 --> 01:02:59,965
...staring at me
with a meat cleaver in her hand.

979
01:03:00,132 --> 01:03:02,467
I thought she was gonna kill me.

980
01:03:03,010 --> 01:03:04,971
I still do.

981
01:03:06,097 --> 01:03:07,389
You get her the gift?

982
01:03:07,556 --> 01:03:11,101
- Yeah, and...
- Well, it usually works.

983
01:03:11,268 --> 01:03:13,396
Okay, Janice, make him look pretty.

984
01:03:13,563 --> 01:03:17,065
He's gonna have this picture
next to his byline for the next 20 years.

985
01:03:50,349 --> 01:03:52,309
What are you doing? Get in here.

986
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:01,818
Patrick, honey, please, stop doing that.
You're gonna make him sick.

987
01:04:01,985 --> 01:04:03,987
- Just eat it, okay?
- Careful, Patrick.

988
01:04:04,155 --> 01:04:07,074
Remember what we did to Marley
when he didn't listen.

989
01:04:07,742 --> 01:04:10,202
Honey, we really have to pick
out a color of fabric...

990
01:04:10,369 --> 01:04:12,371
...for the curtains in the boys' room.

991
01:04:12,538 --> 01:04:16,375
Okay, well, I don't know,
whatever you want.

992
01:04:17,210 --> 01:04:20,420
I'd really like your help deciding.

993
01:04:23,465 --> 01:04:25,885
No, let me get him.

994
01:04:26,052 --> 01:04:27,677
Thank you.

995
01:04:35,143 --> 01:04:37,063
Marley, just...

996
01:04:38,021 --> 01:04:42,068
Marley. Bad dog. Marley. Marley, stop it.

997
01:04:42,235 --> 01:04:46,197
Marley, let go. Let go.
Marley, let go. Marley.

998
01:04:46,364 --> 01:04:49,367
Marley. Marley. Marley, get back here.
Get back here.

999
01:04:49,534 --> 01:04:52,369
Marley. Marley. Bad dog.

1000
01:04:52,536 --> 01:04:54,746
Marley, get back here. Marley.

1001
01:04:54,914 --> 01:04:58,251
See, we were supposed to return these,
and now we have to pay for them.

1002
01:04:58,416 --> 01:05:01,378
- That's okay. Come on, just...
- No, it's not okay. It's not okay.

1003
01:05:01,545 --> 01:05:04,340
I told you not to leave anything edible
where he can get it.

1004
01:05:04,507 --> 01:05:06,925
I know, but you
wouldn't exactly say this is edible.

1005
01:05:07,092 --> 01:05:08,510
John, you know what I mean.

1006
01:05:08,677 --> 01:05:12,431
You said you'd get up early and walk him.
He chews things when he gets restless.

1007
01:05:12,597 --> 01:05:15,393
- I am gonna walk him. I just woke up.
- Know what? Forget it.

1008
01:05:15,559 --> 01:05:17,603
- I'm gonna do it myself.
- You don't have to...

1009
01:05:17,769 --> 01:05:19,105
Yes, I'm doing it myself.

1010
01:05:21,940 --> 01:05:24,443
You don't get it. She's gonna kill you.

1011
01:05:24,610 --> 01:05:27,445
You've got to take it easy.

1012
01:05:27,947 --> 01:05:29,782
We're both hanging by a thread.

1013
01:05:29,949 --> 01:05:33,411
- So who gets the dog if you guys split up?
- We're not splitting up.

1014
01:05:33,577 --> 01:05:35,871
- Out of the realm of possibility?
- Completely.

1015
01:05:36,038 --> 01:05:37,456
There's nothing she can do...

1016
01:05:37,623 --> 01:05:40,793
...no tantrum too big,
no depression too deep...

1017
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:44,297
...no failure to perform wifely duties,
that would push you over?

1018
01:05:44,463 --> 01:05:48,634
Why do you jump right to splitting up?
Come on, buddy. Mend it, don't end it.

1019
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:52,096
- So life is better with Jenny than without?
- Yes, what, uh...?

1020
01:05:52,262 --> 01:05:55,266
Are you wearing a wire? Jen, are you...?
She's listening to this.

1021
01:05:55,432 --> 01:05:58,268
Jenny, yes, we had a fight,
but I still love you.

1022
01:05:58,768 --> 01:06:02,815
I mean, come on, buddy. I had
a fight with my wife. Let me just sulk.

1023
01:06:02,981 --> 01:06:05,318
I just wanna know if you're really happy.

1024
01:06:06,485 --> 01:06:07,903
Oh, wait, there she is.

1025
01:06:08,070 --> 01:06:09,822
Where? Who?
- Give me the kid.

1026
01:06:09,989 --> 01:06:13,701
No, no, no, I can't be a party to this.
That's shameless.

1027
01:06:13,867 --> 01:06:15,911
This is gonna be even better
than the puppy.

1028
01:06:16,077 --> 01:06:18,079
No, not my son.

1029
01:06:55,952 --> 01:06:58,704
Marley, no. Please, please, Marley, no.
Please.

1030
01:06:59,288 --> 01:07:00,456
Please.

1031
01:07:17,056 --> 01:07:20,016
Marley! Marley, what are you...?

1032
01:07:22,143 --> 01:07:24,063
Marley, God, look at this.

1033
01:07:24,230 --> 01:07:28,568
Stop it. Why do you do this?
Why do you ruin everything? Go on.

1034
01:07:30,485 --> 01:07:33,864
Oh. Patrick! Are you okay? I'm sorry.

1035
01:07:35,532 --> 01:07:38,744
John, get that dog out of here.
I want that dog out of here right now.

1036
01:07:38,911 --> 01:07:41,496
- I'll take him for a walk.
- No, take him to that farm.

1037
01:07:41,664 --> 01:07:43,875
All right, buddy,
we're going to the farm again.

1038
01:07:44,041 --> 01:07:45,793
Hey, I'm serious. I'm not kidding.

1039
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:47,961
- I can't take this anymore.
- What did he do?

1040
01:07:48,128 --> 01:07:52,090
Everything. What hasn't he done?
He's just a horrible, horrible animal.

1041
01:07:52,257 --> 01:07:53,717
Well, that's a little unfair.

1042
01:07:53,885 --> 01:07:56,846
No, what's unfair is that Conor
hasn't slept in two weeks...

1043
01:07:57,012 --> 01:07:58,639
...because of that dog's barking...

1044
01:07:58,806 --> 01:08:01,099
...that Patrick gets knocked down
twice a day...

1045
01:08:01,266 --> 01:08:03,101
...that I can't even think straight.

1046
01:08:03,268 --> 01:08:07,190
- And God forbid there's a hint of thunder.
Just calm down for a second.

1047
01:08:07,356 --> 01:08:10,108
I know it's been a rough couple of months
with the new baby.

1048
01:08:10,275 --> 01:08:11,318
I understand that.

1049
01:08:11,485 --> 01:08:14,155
But I was talking with Arnie,
and postpartum depression...

1050
01:08:14,322 --> 01:08:15,780
Don't you dare.

1051
01:08:15,947 --> 01:08:19,452
I am not depressed. I am exhausted.

1052
01:08:19,618 --> 01:08:22,078
I am not angry
because of some condition.

1053
01:08:22,622 --> 01:08:24,957
I can't even go out for an hour
without the kids...

1054
01:08:25,123 --> 01:08:27,792
...because every babysitter
is terrified of Marley.

1055
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:30,296
I know, but you said
you didn't wanna work anymore.

1056
01:08:30,462 --> 01:08:33,048
- We can get help, but you said...
- I don't need any help!

1057
01:08:33,216 --> 01:08:36,092
- Just get rid of the dog.
- That's not gonna happen, obviously.

1058
01:08:36,260 --> 01:08:38,679
- Please keep your voice down.
- Me keep my voice down?

1059
01:08:38,845 --> 01:08:41,515
Just get rid of the dog.
Everybody gets rid of their dogs.

1060
01:08:41,681 --> 01:08:43,434
- It's just a dog.
- I'm just a husband.

1061
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:45,810
- Gonna get rid of me?
- I've thought about it.

1062
01:08:45,978 --> 01:08:49,231
Oh, well, that makes two of us.
- What do you have to complain about?

1063
01:08:49,398 --> 01:08:51,984
What do I...? Oh, because
you're such a joy to be around?

1064
01:08:52,150 --> 01:08:53,402
Oh, you're such a jerk.

1065
01:08:53,569 --> 01:08:56,322
Nice to walk in
and feel like you're joining a chain gang.

1066
01:08:56,488 --> 01:08:57,907
Just a jerk.

1067
01:09:01,327 --> 01:09:02,953
Stop it.

1068
01:09:03,119 --> 01:09:04,663
It's your fault.

1069
01:09:04,831 --> 01:09:06,164
You gotta be kidding me.

1070
01:09:07,375 --> 01:09:11,295
Nope. It's just for a couple days
till things cool down at home.

1071
01:09:13,797 --> 01:09:15,341
A couple days will be all right.

1072
01:09:15,507 --> 01:09:17,399
You guys know each other,
so you should be okay.

1073
01:09:17,402 --> 01:09:19,154
You want a beer?

1074
01:09:19,171 --> 01:09:20,922
I'm all right.

1075
01:09:21,465 --> 01:09:22,507
Are you moving?

1076
01:09:23,300 --> 01:09:25,886
- Yeah.
- Where?

1077
01:09:26,261 --> 01:09:27,304
New York.

1078
01:09:28,471 --> 01:09:31,225
The Gray Lady came a-courting.

1079
01:09:32,059 --> 01:09:34,185
The Times offered you a permanent job?

1080
01:09:35,061 --> 01:09:36,980
Gave Arnie my notice last week.

1081
01:09:37,730 --> 01:09:41,694
- You didn't even say anything.
- I know. I'm sorry, I just...

1082
01:09:42,569 --> 01:09:46,073
It all happened so fast,
I'm not even used to the idea yet.

1083
01:09:46,239 --> 01:09:49,493
That's great. The New York Times.

1084
01:09:49,659 --> 01:09:51,953
It's what we always dreamed of.

1085
01:09:56,625 --> 01:09:59,878
Well, congratulations.
I mean, you deserve it.

1086
01:10:01,713 --> 01:10:03,756
- Thanks for looking after Marley.
- Yeah.

1087
01:10:03,923 --> 01:10:05,842
He's eating your briefcase right now.

1088
01:10:06,010 --> 01:10:08,595
Shit.
Marley. Marley, no.

1089
01:10:08,761 --> 01:10:12,474
- Two days, John, I'm serious.
- Sorry.

1090
01:10:16,770 --> 01:10:20,940
- Sorry, I didn't mean to wake you.
- I wasn't, um, sleeping.

1091
01:10:23,569 --> 01:10:24,694
Where's Marley?

1092
01:10:24,862 --> 01:10:27,614
Sebastian's gonna watch him
for a few days.

1093
01:10:27,780 --> 01:10:30,451
Mm-hm. I'd love to see that.

1094
01:10:31,659 --> 01:10:35,706
Just until I can find
a more permanent home.

1095
01:10:37,457 --> 01:10:41,878
This is his permanent home, John.
Marley's not going anywhere.

1096
01:10:42,046 --> 01:10:45,632
Honey, I'm sorry.
I just got overwhelmed.

1097
01:10:46,216 --> 01:10:48,801
No one tells you
how hard this is all gonna be.

1098
01:10:48,969 --> 01:10:50,637
Which part?

1099
01:10:50,804 --> 01:10:53,056
What? All of it.

1100
01:10:53,724 --> 01:10:56,976
Marriage, being a parent.

1101
01:10:57,144 --> 01:11:00,898
It's the hardest job in the world,
and nobody prepares you for that.

1102
01:11:01,398 --> 01:11:03,943
Nobody tells you
how much you have to give up.

1103
01:11:05,235 --> 01:11:08,655
I feel like they do tell you,
but, I don't know, you don't listen...

1104
01:11:08,822 --> 01:11:11,492
...or you think,
"They're just miserable. "

1105
01:11:16,412 --> 01:11:20,125
I've given up so much
of what made me who I am.

1106
01:11:21,335 --> 01:11:26,548
But I can't say that, because
I'm a very bad person if I say that.

1107
01:11:28,300 --> 01:11:32,680
But I feel that, I really do.
I feel it sometimes.

1108
01:11:33,514 --> 01:11:35,181
I just...

1109
01:11:35,349 --> 01:11:39,435
- I just want you to know that.
- I do know that.

1110
01:11:39,603 --> 01:11:44,233
- And you can say it. I say it.
- But I did make a choice.

1111
01:11:44,733 --> 01:11:49,654
I made a choice,
and even if it's harder than I thought...

1112
01:11:50,613 --> 01:11:51,698
...I don't regret it.

1113
01:11:51,865 --> 01:11:53,658
- Are you sure?
- I'm very sure.

1114
01:11:53,826 --> 01:11:57,037
Because it kind of has a
"there's no place like home" feeling to it.

1115
01:11:57,203 --> 01:12:01,500
I think these things are gonna happen,
and we're gonna get through them.

1116
01:12:01,667 --> 01:12:05,796
- And we'll just do it together.
- Together.

1117
01:12:08,465 --> 01:12:12,636
Getting rid of Marley
is not gonna fix anything.

1118
01:12:12,802 --> 01:12:13,845
No.

1119
01:12:14,012 --> 01:12:18,266
And getting rid of you
isn't gonna fix anything either.

1120
01:12:18,434 --> 01:12:19,935
- Can I ask you a favor?
- Yes.

1121
01:12:20,101 --> 01:12:22,645
No more kids for a while?

1122
01:12:23,271 --> 01:12:26,065
Absolutely. Deal.

1123
01:12:30,613 --> 01:12:32,072
Hi.

1124
01:12:32,238 --> 01:12:34,324
Hi, guys.

1125
01:12:34,490 --> 01:12:36,743
All right, say hello to Colleen.

1126
01:12:36,911 --> 01:12:39,412
- Daddy says her name is Whoops.
- Oh, no, I...

1127
01:12:40,038 --> 01:12:41,582
- Patrick said that.
- What?

1128
01:12:41,748 --> 01:12:43,917
I don't know.
Why did you say that?

1129
01:12:44,083 --> 01:12:46,753
I was just kidding around.
It was kind of a secret, guys.

1130
01:12:46,921 --> 01:12:48,922
Over here.

1131
01:12:50,090 --> 01:12:53,594
Wait, wait. Over here.
Oh, yeah!

1132
01:12:53,761 --> 01:12:55,511
- The old pro brings it back.
Whoo!

1133
01:12:55,679 --> 01:12:58,599
He looks for a little separation,
gets an assist from Colleen.

1134
01:12:58,765 --> 01:13:00,266
Yeah!
- Yeah, score!

1135
01:13:00,434 --> 01:13:04,229
- Nice shot, Dad.
- Come on, "Nice shot"? Come on, Conor.

1136
01:13:04,395 --> 01:13:06,774
- Extraordinary.
Yeah. Again.

1137
01:13:08,149 --> 01:13:10,069
No, wait, let me get that. I'll be back.

1138
01:13:10,235 --> 01:13:13,613
All right.
My knees are shot.

1139
01:13:14,989 --> 01:13:16,617
Hello?

1140
01:13:17,117 --> 01:13:19,036
Yes, it is.

1141
01:13:21,329 --> 01:13:23,457
Uh, yeah, yeah.

1142
01:13:25,208 --> 01:13:27,752
Hi, how are you?
Thanks for getting back to me.

1143
01:13:28,837 --> 01:13:30,381
Oh.
- Oh.

1144
01:13:30,547 --> 01:13:32,632
Darn.
Hey, who was that on the phone?

1145
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:34,592
The Philadelphia Inquirer.

1146
01:13:34,969 --> 01:13:38,389
I sent the editor some clips a while back,
and he wants to meet.

1147
01:13:38,555 --> 01:13:39,974
What's a while back?

1148
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:42,850
He was down here on vacation
like a month ago...

1149
01:13:43,018 --> 01:13:46,145
...and he read my stuff,
and we kind of had lunch.

1150
01:13:46,313 --> 01:13:47,689
How do you kind of have lunch?

1151
01:13:47,856 --> 01:13:50,734
Well, I didn't think anything
was gonna come of it.

1152
01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:54,779
Okay, but...?
- They offered me a job.

1153
01:13:54,947 --> 01:13:57,490
I mean, I have, you know, an interview.

1154
01:13:57,949 --> 01:13:59,743
As, like, a columnist or...?

1155
01:13:59,909 --> 01:14:02,453
- As a reporter.
As a reporter?

1156
01:14:02,621 --> 01:14:03,663
Well, what did you say?

1157
01:14:03,831 --> 01:14:07,251
I said, "Thank you very much,
but I'm happy here. "

1158
01:14:07,877 --> 01:14:11,130
"Never have I heard someone
piss and moan as much as John Grogan.

1159
01:14:11,505 --> 01:14:13,716
If he doesn't like it here,
he should move. "

1160
01:14:13,882 --> 01:14:15,676
Part of my job is to get a response.

1161
01:14:15,842 --> 01:14:18,177
I'm glad to see a little blood flowing
from people.

1162
01:14:18,345 --> 01:14:19,971
No, there's a recurring theme here.

1163
01:14:20,139 --> 01:14:22,850
The theme is that we got a lot of cranks
in Broward County.

1164
01:14:23,016 --> 01:14:24,268
That's what I'm up against.

1165
01:14:24,435 --> 01:14:27,854
What I'm trying to say, with all
due respect, is that you are one of them.

1166
01:14:28,021 --> 01:14:29,273
Well, I'm a commentator.

1167
01:14:29,439 --> 01:14:32,693
Everyone wants me to act like
everything's great when there are issues.

1168
01:14:32,859 --> 01:14:36,779
There's overcrowding, there's crime,
there's racial tensions.

1169
01:14:36,947 --> 01:14:40,451
Every time you turn around, there's
a new sky rise even uglier than the...

1170
01:14:40,618 --> 01:14:44,204
That goes on all over the world.
It's not Florida, it's you. What's wrong?

1171
01:14:44,371 --> 01:14:46,582
Nothing's wrong.
Everyone wants to think:

1172
01:14:46,748 --> 01:14:49,210
"Oh, he's turning 40.
He's become a curmudgeon. "

1173
01:14:49,376 --> 01:14:52,546
That's not it. Maybe...

1174
01:14:53,046 --> 01:14:56,382
I don't know. I don't know,
maybe I'm sick of my column.

1175
01:14:56,550 --> 01:15:00,220
I don't find the things that I'm saying
that interesting.

1176
01:15:00,386 --> 01:15:03,474
John, John, you're the comic voice
of South Florida.

1177
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:05,850
You're a national treasure,
for God's sakes.

1178
01:15:06,018 --> 01:15:07,394
Maybe a regional treasure.

1179
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:09,813
- Well, a municipal treasure for sure.
- Thank you.

1180
01:15:09,979 --> 01:15:12,899
Listen, take a vacation.
Go away for a couple weeks.

1181
01:15:13,067 --> 01:15:15,152
- Take a month off.
- And go where?

1182
01:15:15,319 --> 01:15:18,822
- I don't know. Take...
- I live in a vacation spot.

1183
01:15:19,489 --> 01:15:22,076
Then go someplace
where it's painful and sad.

1184
01:15:33,753 --> 01:15:38,007
Forty is gonna be tough, buddy.
I'm not gonna lie to you.

1185
01:15:40,051 --> 01:15:41,761
But we knew that.

1186
01:15:41,929 --> 01:15:45,140
We knew this was when Father Time
was gonna make his move...

1187
01:15:45,306 --> 01:15:48,519
...try to take us down a dark alley
and just beat the hell out of us.

1188
01:15:49,395 --> 01:15:52,105
You got a little more white
around the temples...

1189
01:15:52,273 --> 01:15:56,652
...but it makes you look
more distinguished, I think.

1190
01:15:56,819 --> 01:15:58,237
We both lost a step.

1191
01:16:00,948 --> 01:16:03,826
Well, how's it feel
to have your best years behind you?

1192
01:16:03,993 --> 01:16:06,453
You do everything you wanted to?

1193
01:16:07,412 --> 01:16:10,457
No, me neither.

1194
01:16:11,958 --> 01:16:16,505
All right. You hot?
You wanna cool off? Let's do it.

1195
01:16:21,135 --> 01:16:22,802
You know what?

1196
01:16:23,386 --> 01:16:25,305
Not today.

1197
01:16:25,972 --> 01:16:27,975
You've been on a leash a little too long.

1198
01:16:29,310 --> 01:16:30,978
Go, go.

1199
01:16:37,443 --> 01:16:39,444
You got a little bit of a second wind.

1200
01:16:50,331 --> 01:16:52,082
Go get it.

1201
01:17:27,117 --> 01:17:29,703
- Hey, get your dog!
- What?

1202
01:17:36,460 --> 01:17:38,546
No, no. Please, God, no.

1203
01:17:39,255 --> 01:17:42,716
No, no, no!

1204
01:17:48,221 --> 01:17:51,350
Come here, come here. It's okay.

1205
01:17:51,891 --> 01:17:55,395
Dude, that was not cool.

1206
01:17:56,188 --> 01:17:58,231
Come on, girl, let's go!

1207
01:18:03,028 --> 01:18:04,488
Great.

1208
01:18:06,907 --> 01:18:09,076
Let's go. Let's go.

1209
01:18:13,454 --> 01:18:18,752
Man, you are the world's worst dog.
You know that, right?

1210
01:18:18,918 --> 01:18:21,421
You were top five going into the day...

1211
01:18:21,588 --> 01:18:24,632
...and with this little stunt,
you moved into number one.

1212
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:26,510
And I take my hat off to you.

1213
01:18:37,854 --> 01:18:39,899
Surprise!

1214
01:19:03,463 --> 01:19:05,048
Dad, can I blow out...?

1215
01:19:06,466 --> 01:19:08,301
- Happy birthday.
- Yes, you can help me.

1216
01:19:08,469 --> 01:19:09,970
But hold on, hold on. On three.

1217
01:19:10,136 --> 01:19:13,640
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

1218
01:19:21,148 --> 01:19:23,609
But don't beg, Marley.

1219
01:19:23,775 --> 01:19:27,488
That's not good.
Because we don't have to.

1220
01:19:29,239 --> 01:19:32,743
Tell me the truth. Were you surprised?

1221
01:19:32,909 --> 01:19:34,828
Completely, yes. Thank you.

1222
01:19:34,994 --> 01:19:37,288
- Really?
- I was. You guys got me.

1223
01:19:37,456 --> 01:19:39,250
We got you.

1224
01:19:40,251 --> 01:19:42,336
Are you ready for your birthday present?

1225
01:19:42,502 --> 01:19:45,922
There's more?
I don't need any other present.

1226
01:19:49,969 --> 01:19:53,096
- Happy birthday.
- What was that?

1227
01:19:53,264 --> 01:19:57,268
That was my blessing
to take that job in Philadelphia.

1228
01:19:58,018 --> 01:20:00,520
That was months ago.
I'm not thinking about that.

1229
01:20:00,688 --> 01:20:04,524
Well, then any other job.
We'll follow you wherever you wanna go.

1230
01:20:04,692 --> 01:20:07,694
I understand, but I'm not gonna do that.
I'm not gonna uproot us.

1231
01:20:07,862 --> 01:20:10,154
We've got our friends,
the kids enjoy school...

1232
01:20:10,322 --> 01:20:11,990
...and I've got my poker game.

1233
01:20:12,157 --> 01:20:15,368
- I couldn't possibly.
- First of all, it's just an interview.

1234
01:20:15,536 --> 01:20:16,871
You don't have the job yet.

1235
01:20:17,037 --> 01:20:20,207
And second of all,
honey, you don't have any friends.

1236
01:20:20,373 --> 01:20:23,502
That's right. I was wondering,
who were all those strangers tonight?

1237
01:20:23,668 --> 01:20:25,003
I hired them.

1238
01:20:25,170 --> 01:20:28,506
What I'm trying to say is that our life
is here, and I'm okay with that.

1239
01:20:28,673 --> 01:20:30,341
Our life is wherever we are.

1240
01:20:30,717 --> 01:20:33,554
- That's it. And you're not happy here.
- That's not true.

1241
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:36,806
You're not happy doing that column.
You're restless. I can feel it.

1242
01:20:36,974 --> 01:20:38,016
I'm not.

1243
01:20:38,182 --> 01:20:41,060
I feel it every day
that you read Sebastian's articles.

1244
01:20:41,228 --> 01:20:44,230
I feel it every time you sit
an extra five minutes in your car...

1245
01:20:44,398 --> 01:20:45,481
...before you come in.

1246
01:20:45,649 --> 01:20:46,817
- I don't do that.
- You do.

1247
01:20:46,984 --> 01:20:51,029
- I'm checking things in the car, I'm not...
- I just think it's time for a change.

1248
01:20:51,197 --> 01:20:53,239
I'm 40, Jen.

1249
01:20:53,407 --> 01:20:56,702
Maybe at 39, but I'm too... I don't know.

1250
01:20:56,868 --> 01:20:59,078
It feels a little late
to be making big changes.

1251
01:20:59,246 --> 01:21:01,289
No, no, no. Uh-uh-uh.

1252
01:21:01,457 --> 01:21:03,042
What are you doing?

1253
01:21:03,417 --> 01:21:05,877
We're not old, John.

1254
01:21:09,590 --> 01:21:11,257
We can still surprise ourselves.

1255
01:21:16,721 --> 01:21:18,556
See, most girls would do
a swan dive...

1256
01:21:18,724 --> 01:21:21,393
...but you know
that a cannonball is so much sexier.

1257
01:21:24,646 --> 01:21:27,399
So are you ready
for your other birthday present or what?

1258
01:21:27,565 --> 01:21:29,443
Yes.

1259
01:21:30,402 --> 01:21:33,738
This is like an embarrassment of riches,
this birthday.

1260
01:21:33,905 --> 01:21:36,449
They just keep coming.
It's like Hanukkah.

1261
01:21:44,291 --> 01:21:46,460
See? We're not old.

1262
01:21:55,051 --> 01:21:56,929
Grogan.

1263
01:22:06,145 --> 01:22:08,983
- Just wanna wish you good luck up there.
- Thanks. Yeah.

1264
01:22:09,149 --> 01:22:11,819
It'll be good. I'm gonna miss everybody.

1265
01:22:11,985 --> 01:22:14,070
- I'm gonna miss your laugh.
- Yeah.

1266
01:22:14,238 --> 01:22:18,117
There's a good chance that every piece
of advice I gave you was a lot of crap.

1267
01:22:18,283 --> 01:22:21,578
Oh, no, no. I appreciate it just the same.

1268
01:22:21,744 --> 01:22:25,623
Well, at this point, a mushy guy
would tell you he was proud of you...

1269
01:22:25,791 --> 01:22:28,502
...give you a hug,
and send you on your way.

1270
01:22:29,086 --> 01:22:32,840
Well, I'm glad you're not that guy, sir.

1271
01:22:34,132 --> 01:22:35,175
All right.

1272
01:22:35,341 --> 01:22:37,552
Okay. Thanks.

1273
01:22:37,970 --> 01:22:41,472
Grogan, just for the record,
you surprised the hell out of me.

1274
01:22:41,640 --> 01:22:44,184
That's my specialty.

1275
01:23:05,706 --> 01:23:07,541
Are we here yet?
No.

1276
01:23:07,707 --> 01:23:10,211
Now?
We got a couple hours to go.

1277
01:23:10,377 --> 01:23:12,212
Now?
Soak it up.

1278
01:23:12,378 --> 01:23:14,381
Now?
We must be near it.

1279
01:23:14,547 --> 01:23:16,800
Are we getting hot or cold?
Ha, ha, ha.

1280
01:23:16,966 --> 01:23:19,470
Why are we turning in here?
We're living here.

1281
01:23:19,636 --> 01:23:20,970
Whoa.

1282
01:23:21,137 --> 01:23:24,182
I want a moment of silence
just to take this in, okay?

1283
01:23:24,350 --> 01:23:28,520
Before the pandemonium. Look at this.

1284
01:23:28,686 --> 01:23:32,608
- Here we go.
Come on, we're here.

1285
01:23:39,657 --> 01:23:41,199
Marley. Marley, no.

1286
01:23:41,367 --> 01:23:43,743
Marley, Marley, Marley, no, no.
Marley, no.

1287
01:23:44,619 --> 01:23:46,079
And we're home.

1288
01:23:52,752 --> 01:23:56,215
Hey, Andy Rooney. If you're knocking off,
I'll walk with you to the train.

1289
01:23:56,381 --> 01:24:00,051
Okay, I'm ready.
Put an exclamation point here.

1290
01:24:00,219 --> 01:24:02,429
Mark Twain said
not to use exclamation points...

1291
01:24:02,595 --> 01:24:04,722
...because it's like laughing
at your own joke.

1292
01:24:04,890 --> 01:24:07,768
Sometimes you gotta laugh
at your own joke because it's funny.

1293
01:24:07,935 --> 01:24:10,979
- It's here, it's here, it's here!
- Mom, get up, get up, get up.

1294
01:24:11,145 --> 01:24:14,315
Where? Where? Where?
Over here.

1295
01:24:14,483 --> 01:24:18,695
Come on, come on, come on.
It's here, it's here.

1296
01:24:18,863 --> 01:24:21,282
Come on, Dad. Look, Daddy.
Come on, come on, come on.

1297
01:24:21,448 --> 01:24:22,949
Whoa, Daddy.

1298
01:24:39,966 --> 01:24:41,010
Whoa!

1299
01:24:42,344 --> 01:24:44,095
Okay, look at me. Guys, guys, guys.

1300
01:24:45,764 --> 01:24:50,476
Remember, angels can fly,
so you gotta get the wings up high.

1301
01:24:50,644 --> 01:24:53,439
Yeah. Now, that one's coming.
Now you can really see it.

1302
01:24:53,605 --> 01:24:55,190
Guys, lunch is ready.

1303
01:24:55,356 --> 01:24:57,902
Okay. Heading in.
Take that.

1304
01:24:58,068 --> 01:25:00,112
I'll get you.
Let's go. Marley!

1305
01:25:00,279 --> 01:25:03,032
Come on, guys.
- Marley, come on. Marley.

1306
01:25:03,198 --> 01:25:06,368
No, no, you know what, honey?
Let him be. He's happy.

1307
01:25:10,914 --> 01:25:12,457
Thank you.

1308
01:25:32,603 --> 01:25:34,104
What are you doing in here?

1309
01:25:34,521 --> 01:25:37,190
You're going for the bunk bed tonight?

1310
01:25:38,442 --> 01:25:42,363
Pretty good day.
I mean, the snow? Come on.

1311
01:25:42,529 --> 01:25:45,198
All right. Sleep tight.

1312
01:25:52,664 --> 01:25:54,707
Too much color?
Yeah.

1313
01:25:55,376 --> 01:25:59,171
Don't get me wrong, it's a good piece.
But you're reporting now, John.

1314
01:25:59,337 --> 01:26:02,382
I want you to tell the story,
I don't want you to be in the story.

1315
01:26:02,550 --> 01:26:04,760
I'm pretty sure I don't mention myself
in there.

1316
01:26:04,926 --> 01:26:07,595
The point is, I still feel you in there.

1317
01:26:07,762 --> 01:26:10,640
And all I'm saying
is less you and more facts.

1318
01:26:12,434 --> 01:26:13,810
Got it.

1319
01:26:16,354 --> 01:26:18,439
- Door's always open.
- Thanks.

1320
01:26:18,606 --> 01:26:20,067
Hut.

1321
01:26:23,863 --> 01:26:25,405
He's coming, he's coming.

1322
01:26:26,948 --> 01:26:31,078
Here comes the old pro.
He shows up for the fourth quarter.

1323
01:26:31,744 --> 01:26:35,498
Yeah. Oh, yes. He catches it.

1324
01:26:35,666 --> 01:26:37,376
Then he fends off one guy.

1325
01:26:37,542 --> 01:26:40,671
He's running through there.
He's shaking tackles left and right.

1326
01:26:40,837 --> 01:26:44,591
They can't get him,
because he's got too much...

1327
01:26:46,092 --> 01:26:49,555
And Grogan goes down.
Down goes Grogan.

1328
01:26:49,721 --> 01:26:51,599
- You're home early.
That's right.

1329
01:26:51,765 --> 01:26:56,228
I had to come home and teach these kids
how to play football the right way.

1330
01:26:56,729 --> 01:26:58,104
Okay.

1331
01:26:58,271 --> 01:27:00,733
Guys, dinner's in an hour.
Okay.

1332
01:27:00,899 --> 01:27:02,775
And I want you
to finish your homework...

1333
01:27:02,943 --> 01:27:05,069
...and take off those shoes
before you come in.

1334
01:27:05,237 --> 01:27:07,280
Yeah, take off your shoes.

1335
01:27:07,448 --> 01:27:10,783
Ground and pound,
ground and pound, ground and pound.

1336
01:27:12,578 --> 01:27:13,662
Ow.

1337
01:27:14,913 --> 01:27:17,123
My God.

1338
01:27:17,291 --> 01:27:20,793
I come home,
and it's like I got mugged.

1339
01:27:20,961 --> 01:27:22,755
Okay.

1340
01:27:25,341 --> 01:27:26,800
Come on.

1341
01:27:26,966 --> 01:27:28,469
What's wrong with him, Dad?

1342
01:27:29,136 --> 01:27:32,139
Nothing's wrong. He's just tired.
Right, Dad?

1343
01:27:32,305 --> 01:27:35,809
Yeah.
I think the football took it out of him.

1344
01:27:37,144 --> 01:27:38,729
Let's go.

1345
01:27:39,729 --> 01:27:41,564
I don't know, I just don't understand.

1346
01:27:41,731 --> 01:27:44,777
A year ago, you couldn't wait to be done
with your column.

1347
01:27:44,944 --> 01:27:47,154
I know, but now I got this guy...

1348
01:27:47,320 --> 01:27:50,114
...going through every sentence
with a fine-toothed comb...

1349
01:27:50,282 --> 01:27:53,159
...and I gotta admit, I miss the freedom,
where I could just...

1350
01:27:53,327 --> 01:27:54,578
What?

1351
01:27:54,744 --> 01:27:57,581
It's just...
It's exhausting sometimes, John.

1352
01:27:58,498 --> 01:28:01,417
You always wanting something
that you don't have.

1353
01:28:01,585 --> 01:28:03,628
Are you happy?

1354
01:28:04,630 --> 01:28:08,384
- I mean, none of this was part of the plan.
- No.

1355
01:28:08,551 --> 01:28:10,469
No, it wasn't part of the plan.

1356
01:28:11,261 --> 01:28:13,346
But it's so much better.

1357
01:28:14,430 --> 01:28:17,100
You know?
I'm just sort of done making plans.

1358
01:28:17,268 --> 01:28:20,436
Ugh. Marley. Oh, gross.

1359
01:28:20,604 --> 01:28:24,149
- Seems like somebody needs to go out.
- Ugh, whew.

1360
01:28:24,608 --> 01:28:25,734
All right. Marley.

1361
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:29,195
Come on. Come on, boy.

1362
01:28:31,323 --> 01:28:33,117
Oh, come on.

1363
01:28:33,617 --> 01:28:36,453
Now it's really coming down.

1364
01:28:41,082 --> 01:28:42,751
Marley?

1365
01:28:43,793 --> 01:28:45,462
Marley!

1366
01:28:45,628 --> 01:28:47,715
Where did he go? Marley!

1367
01:28:49,382 --> 01:28:50,426
What's going on?

1368
01:28:50,592 --> 01:28:53,845
I don't know, he's just...
He's not coming back.

1369
01:28:54,012 --> 01:28:57,807
- Marley!
- Well, he couldn't have gone far.

1370
01:28:57,975 --> 01:29:01,854
- Marley!
- I'll come with you. Hold on.

1371
01:29:03,104 --> 01:29:07,067
Marley!
I don't know where he could've gone.

1372
01:29:07,234 --> 01:29:09,819
Maybe he went next door again
in the barn.

1373
01:29:09,987 --> 01:29:13,740
- Well, we can check in the woodshed.
Okay.

1374
01:29:14,408 --> 01:29:16,452
Marley!

1375
01:29:21,748 --> 01:29:23,458
Marley?

1376
01:29:24,585 --> 01:29:26,337
Marley.

1377
01:29:26,502 --> 01:29:28,421
Oh. Where the...?

1378
01:29:30,090 --> 01:29:33,176
- Do you see anything?
- No, nothing.

1379
01:29:38,431 --> 01:29:41,393
- I gotta go talk to them.
- Okay.

1380
01:29:42,435 --> 01:29:45,773
Oh, wow, it's pouring out there.

1381
01:29:45,939 --> 01:29:47,190
Did you find him?

1382
01:29:47,358 --> 01:29:51,654
You know what? He's out exploring.

1383
01:29:51,819 --> 01:29:53,613
You know how he loves the woods.

1384
01:29:56,783 --> 01:30:00,037
Bobby says dogs,
when they're gonna die...

1385
01:30:00,203 --> 01:30:01,913
...they go away to do it.

1386
01:30:02,081 --> 01:30:03,457
That's what his beagle did.

1387
01:30:03,748 --> 01:30:04,875
Mm.

1388
01:30:05,042 --> 01:30:07,293
Well, you know what,
that's true for beagles...

1389
01:30:07,461 --> 01:30:10,547
...but, uh, not Labs like Marley.

1390
01:30:10,713 --> 01:30:14,134
He's just out causing trouble.
Don't worry.

1391
01:30:14,301 --> 01:30:16,804
Okay, now,
you finished with your homework?

1392
01:30:16,970 --> 01:30:18,137
- Yep.
- Nope.

1393
01:30:18,305 --> 01:30:23,018
Nope? Well, let's make that
a "yep. " Come on, now.

1394
01:30:28,274 --> 01:30:30,359
Marley!

1395
01:30:30,525 --> 01:30:32,485
Marley!

1396
01:30:36,532 --> 01:30:38,242
Marley!

1397
01:30:42,829 --> 01:30:44,289
Marley.

1398
01:30:45,666 --> 01:30:47,251
Marley.

1399
01:30:47,835 --> 01:30:49,920
Marley, are you okay?

1400
01:30:53,798 --> 01:30:55,592
Just stay there.

1401
01:30:57,720 --> 01:31:01,806
Why did his stomach twist?
We don't exactly know why this happens.

1402
01:31:01,974 --> 01:31:04,601
Most likely,
he ate or drank something quickly...

1403
01:31:04,768 --> 01:31:06,353
...and his stomach just flipped.

1404
01:31:06,520 --> 01:31:09,689
I did manage to get a tube down there
to relieve some of the gas.

1405
01:31:09,856 --> 01:31:13,277
- I think I untwisted it.
- He seems okay.

1406
01:31:14,528 --> 01:31:16,238
For now he's good.

1407
01:31:16,404 --> 01:31:19,949
The problem is that once this happens,
it almost always happens again.

1408
01:31:20,117 --> 01:31:23,369
And if it does, I don't know
what I'm gonna be able to do for him.

1409
01:31:23,537 --> 01:31:25,038
He's an older dog.

1410
01:31:25,206 --> 01:31:28,000
I honestly don't think
he would survive the surgery.

1411
01:31:28,167 --> 01:31:30,961
Well, we have to make sure
that it doesn't happen again.

1412
01:31:31,127 --> 01:31:32,880
Most likely, it is gonna happen again.

1413
01:31:33,046 --> 01:31:35,716
Well, you also talked about
that maybe he ate too fast...

1414
01:31:35,882 --> 01:31:37,885
...or drank, you know, too quickly...

1415
01:31:38,051 --> 01:31:40,804
...and so maybe
it doesn't have to happen again.

1416
01:31:40,970 --> 01:31:42,222
We'll monitor that.

1417
01:31:43,224 --> 01:31:45,518
I'm just saying
you may wanna prepare yourself...

1418
01:31:45,684 --> 01:31:48,186
...that he may not make it
through the night.

1419
01:31:50,021 --> 01:31:53,734
Maybe 10 percent of dogs
survive this kind of a thing.

1420
01:31:53,900 --> 01:31:57,195
What is that number based on?

1421
01:31:58,113 --> 01:31:59,155
What is it based on?

1422
01:31:59,323 --> 01:32:03,577
Yeah, the reason why I ask is, I bet
that number is based on regular dogs.

1423
01:32:03,743 --> 01:32:04,787
Regular dogs?

1424
01:32:04,953 --> 01:32:07,706
Yeah, and this guy here
is not like other dogs.

1425
01:32:07,872 --> 01:32:09,625
I know people say that all the time...

1426
01:32:09,792 --> 01:32:12,752
...but to be honest,
I'm not sure he really is a dog.

1427
01:32:12,920 --> 01:32:16,006
He once ate an answering machine,
just polished it off.

1428
01:32:16,172 --> 01:32:18,591
He didn't chew it,
he ate it and then digested it...

1429
01:32:18,759 --> 01:32:20,552
...and then had the phone for dessert.

1430
01:32:20,719 --> 01:32:24,722
Another time, my son had colic,
and this guy sat up all night, didn't move.

1431
01:32:24,890 --> 01:32:28,226
Just stayed right there for nine hours,
just keeping an eye on Conor.

1432
01:32:28,394 --> 01:32:32,856
So I think maybe that the, you know,
the number applies to regular dogs...

1433
01:32:33,023 --> 01:32:34,065
...but not to him.

1434
01:32:34,233 --> 01:32:36,777
Well, you've got a fighter here.

1435
01:32:36,944 --> 01:32:38,362
Let's hope for the best.

1436
01:32:39,238 --> 01:32:43,158
Oh, I know he's gonna be okay.
I'll see you in the morning.

1437
01:33:03,845 --> 01:33:06,640
Oh, hi.
- Hey.

1438
01:33:06,806 --> 01:33:11,854
They're gonna keep him overnight,
but he seemed better when I left.

1439
01:33:12,020 --> 01:33:15,649
And the vet really seemed on top of it.

1440
01:33:17,650 --> 01:33:19,819
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

1441
01:33:19,987 --> 01:33:24,158
- What are you reading?
- I'm reading your old columns.

1442
01:33:26,784 --> 01:33:29,162
Marley's in so many of them.

1443
01:33:29,329 --> 01:33:31,332
You still look at those?

1444
01:33:31,497 --> 01:33:34,083
Yeah, I do sometimes.

1445
01:33:35,668 --> 01:33:38,338
Even on the crappiest days...

1446
01:33:38,713 --> 01:33:43,676
...when the kids are driving me nuts,
the laundry's not done...

1447
01:33:43,844 --> 01:33:46,512
...and a hundred other things
are wrong...

1448
01:33:46,680 --> 01:33:49,475
...I always know that I have this.

1449
01:33:51,100 --> 01:33:53,436
It's five minutes of you.

1450
01:33:54,563 --> 01:33:56,814
Sometimes they're sad...

1451
01:33:56,981 --> 01:34:00,694
...and sometimes they're really funny,
silly or whatever...

1452
01:34:00,860 --> 01:34:03,988
...but they're all you.

1453
01:34:05,615 --> 01:34:08,118
And for those five minutes...

1454
01:34:08,284 --> 01:34:10,453
...you make me feel better.

1455
01:34:24,385 --> 01:34:27,555
You should read them.
They're pretty great.

1456
01:34:29,222 --> 01:34:31,391
Might even make a nice book.

1457
01:34:31,559 --> 01:34:34,395
- A book?
- Something.

1458
01:34:50,368 --> 01:34:51,828
Hello?

1459
01:34:54,247 --> 01:34:55,707
All right.

1460
01:34:55,875 --> 01:34:57,501
Thank you.

1461
01:34:59,502 --> 01:35:00,921
He's coming home.

1462
01:35:11,931 --> 01:35:13,434
Is he there?

1463
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:17,061
Of course he's there.
He's always there.

1464
01:35:17,229 --> 01:35:19,480
How does he know when we're coming?

1465
01:35:19,981 --> 01:35:21,859
I don't know. He just knows.

1466
01:35:22,443 --> 01:35:23,944
Dogs know stuff like that.

1467
01:35:24,110 --> 01:35:26,947
- All dogs?
- All good dogs.

1468
01:35:27,113 --> 01:35:30,701
- Look, there he is. There he is, Marley.
- Yeah.

1469
01:35:35,456 --> 01:35:37,707
Hi, Marley.

1470
01:35:37,875 --> 01:35:39,542
- Marley.
- How you doing, Marley?

1471
01:35:39,710 --> 01:35:42,671
- I missed you at school.
- Hey, I'll race you to the house.

1472
01:35:42,837 --> 01:35:44,715
- Okay.
- Go.

1473
01:35:51,805 --> 01:35:54,557
Eagles?
The Eagles are going all the way.

1474
01:35:54,725 --> 01:35:56,226
- I don't know.
- I guarantee you.

1475
01:35:56,393 --> 01:35:58,103
- What are you, a Dolphins fan?
- No.

1476
01:35:58,270 --> 01:36:00,773
- John Grogan.
- Hey.

1477
01:36:00,939 --> 01:36:02,524
- I'll see you tomorrow.
All right.

1478
01:36:02,690 --> 01:36:05,985
I said to myself, "That sorry
son of a bitch looks like John Grogan. "

1479
01:36:06,987 --> 01:36:08,905
What are you doing here?
- A story.

1480
01:36:09,073 --> 01:36:11,324
DEA's showing off the new field office.
I'm cov...

1481
01:36:11,492 --> 01:36:14,161
You know what? Doesn't matter.
Man, it is good to see you.

1482
01:36:14,328 --> 01:36:16,829
- It's good to see you.
Yeah.

1483
01:36:16,997 --> 01:36:19,958
- You living in the city somewhere?
- I live just outside of town.

1484
01:36:20,125 --> 01:36:21,335
More space for the kids.

1485
01:36:21,502 --> 01:36:24,003
- Oh, what do you got, like five now?
- Three. Here.

1486
01:36:24,171 --> 01:36:27,131
I'll show you a little snapshot
of the Grogan brood.

1487
01:36:28,551 --> 01:36:33,012
- Ha. Wow, Jen's holding up.
- Yeah, thanks. I think.

1488
01:36:33,180 --> 01:36:36,057
I see you finally got a little girl, huh?

1489
01:36:36,225 --> 01:36:40,311
- Colleen. She arrived after you left.
- What's with the ladybug getup?

1490
01:36:40,479 --> 01:36:42,898
That was for her school play
in preschool...

1491
01:36:43,064 --> 01:36:46,569
...and then we couldn't get her out
of her costume for a month afterwards.

1492
01:36:46,734 --> 01:36:49,654
And the reason why Marley
looks like he's biting her head...

1493
01:36:49,822 --> 01:36:52,365
...is because of the antennas on...
He went ballistic.

1494
01:36:52,533 --> 01:36:55,618
- Things don't change.
- That's right.

1495
01:36:58,538 --> 01:37:00,875
I wish I didn't have this interview.

1496
01:37:01,041 --> 01:37:04,086
That's okay, I gotta get home. I got...
Conor's got a soccer game.

1497
01:37:04,252 --> 01:37:06,838
All right, well, one of these days
we've gotta catch up.

1498
01:37:07,006 --> 01:37:09,841
Yeah, let's do that.
We'll catch up one of these days.

1499
01:37:10,009 --> 01:37:13,720
- Well, it was, uh, good to see you.
- Come here. Good to see you.

1500
01:37:13,887 --> 01:37:16,556
- Give Jenny my best, okay?
- All right. I will. Okay.

1501
01:37:16,724 --> 01:37:18,057
- Here.
- Oh, yeah.

1502
01:37:18,225 --> 01:37:22,229
Here. That's a great picture, John.

1503
01:37:22,395 --> 01:37:23,646
You did okay.

1504
01:37:24,606 --> 01:37:27,525
Thanks. You did okay too.

1505
01:37:27,693 --> 01:37:29,569
- I'll see you.
- I'll see you.

1506
01:37:30,029 --> 01:37:32,030
I think you'll like the next one better.

1507
01:37:32,198 --> 01:37:33,657
Good.

1508
01:37:34,574 --> 01:37:37,828
Don't do it to yourself. We're in Philly.
Let's get a cheese steak. Hi.

1509
01:37:37,994 --> 01:37:39,078
Hi.
Sebastian.

1510
01:37:39,246 --> 01:37:40,413
Hello.
Nice to meet you.

1511
01:37:40,581 --> 01:37:42,416
Nice to meet you.

1512
01:37:45,668 --> 01:37:47,587
Hello?

1513
01:37:52,760 --> 01:37:54,761
Is anybody home?

1514
01:37:59,934 --> 01:38:03,229
Marley, hey. Marley, Marley, Marley.

1515
01:38:03,395 --> 01:38:06,564
Hey, hey. Marley. Marley.

1516
01:38:07,149 --> 01:38:11,278
Marley. You didn't hear me, did you?

1517
01:38:11,444 --> 01:38:15,157
I just caught you
in a senior moment there, Marley.

1518
01:38:15,323 --> 01:38:19,286
All right, let's go for a walk.
Come on, let's go.

1519
01:38:32,466 --> 01:38:36,427
Come on. Come on.
You're almost to the top.

1520
01:38:36,595 --> 01:38:38,889
You know what? Come here.

1521
01:38:39,055 --> 01:38:41,391
This is a good spot right here.

1522
01:38:50,359 --> 01:38:54,154
I know you're a strong boy,
but you're gonna let me know, all right?

1523
01:38:54,904 --> 01:38:56,407
You know, when it's time.

1524
01:38:57,824 --> 01:39:00,911
I don't wanna make that decision
on my own.

1525
01:39:02,496 --> 01:39:04,331
You let me know when you're ready,
okay?

1526
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:11,921
All right.

1527
01:39:21,390 --> 01:39:22,682
Marley?

1528
01:39:24,225 --> 01:39:26,103
There he is.

1529
01:39:26,895 --> 01:39:28,771
Marley.

1530
01:39:29,814 --> 01:39:32,734
Hi. Honey,
what are you doing down here?

1531
01:39:32,902 --> 01:39:36,947
It's time to head upstairs.
You don't sleep down here.

1532
01:39:37,113 --> 01:39:39,033
Come on.

1533
01:39:39,533 --> 01:39:41,118
Can you make it upstairs?

1534
01:39:43,537 --> 01:39:46,707
I think he's pretty comfortable
down here.

1535
01:39:47,666 --> 01:39:51,212
- I'll get him a blanket.
- You all right?

1536
01:39:56,382 --> 01:39:59,302
I'm gonna lay down here for a second.

1537
01:39:59,970 --> 01:40:02,347
Take a load off.

1538
01:40:04,390 --> 01:40:08,979
Yeah. It's actually nice down here.

1539
01:40:09,145 --> 01:40:11,189
This might be better.

1540
01:40:14,734 --> 01:40:16,654
Well, it would be twice a week,
600 words.

1541
01:40:16,819 --> 01:40:17,904
And what's the subject?

1542
01:40:18,072 --> 01:40:21,115
You know, everyday stuff.
The stuff we all go through, but funnier.

1543
01:40:21,283 --> 01:40:23,911
I don't get it.
I thought you came here to be a reporter.

1544
01:40:24,078 --> 01:40:26,204
I know, I did,
but we both know that isn't me.

1545
01:40:26,372 --> 01:40:28,414
I'm a columnist, a good one,
and I think...

1546
01:40:28,582 --> 01:40:31,417
Excuse me, John?
Your wife's on the phone. It's important.

1547
01:40:31,585 --> 01:40:33,087
Okay, I'll be right there.

1548
01:40:33,253 --> 01:40:36,673
Think about it? Possible?

1549
01:40:37,423 --> 01:40:38,509
- Thanks.
You're welcome.

1550
01:40:38,676 --> 01:40:41,595
- Hello?
- I can't get him to come back inside.

1551
01:40:42,095 --> 01:40:46,432
He's just laying out there in the cold,
and he won't move.

1552
01:41:00,029 --> 01:41:01,532
- Hey.
Hi.

1553
01:41:02,032 --> 01:41:03,783
Patrick came home,
and we got him here.

1554
01:41:03,951 --> 01:41:09,122
Dr. Platt said that if he's comfortable,
leave him for a while and see.

1555
01:41:09,832 --> 01:41:12,542
But he's just not getting better.

1556
01:41:15,628 --> 01:41:17,922
All right. I'm gonna take him in.

1557
01:41:19,550 --> 01:41:22,636
- Is he sick again?
- Yeah, he is, honey.

1558
01:41:22,802 --> 01:41:24,596
He doesn't feel too good.

1559
01:41:24,762 --> 01:41:28,475
But I'm gonna take him to the doctor.
They're gonna try to make him feel better.

1560
01:41:28,641 --> 01:41:31,311
It's all right, Marley.
You're gonna be okay.

1561
01:41:35,940 --> 01:41:40,820
You could take Lamby,
but don't chew her other ear off.

1562
01:41:40,988 --> 01:41:43,448
That's sweet, honey.

1563
01:41:43,615 --> 01:41:45,533
Here, I'll take it.

1564
01:41:49,787 --> 01:41:50,831
Bye.

1565
01:42:34,707 --> 01:42:36,167
Okay.

1566
01:42:59,859 --> 01:43:02,403
I've tried everything I did last time
that worked...

1567
01:43:02,569 --> 01:43:04,904
...but I'm not having any luck.

1568
01:43:05,072 --> 01:43:09,118
I'm not able to get the tube down there.
The stomach is still twisted.

1569
01:43:09,284 --> 01:43:13,497
- There's still surgery, but...
- He's not strong enough.

1570
01:43:23,090 --> 01:43:25,926
- I like this one the best.
Which one?

1571
01:43:26,426 --> 01:43:28,304
Oh, the mangoes. Yeah.

1572
01:43:31,055 --> 01:43:33,684
- Hello?
Hey, it's me.

1573
01:43:35,394 --> 01:43:37,104
So it's his stomach again.

1574
01:43:37,270 --> 01:43:40,649
And they could do surgery, but...

1575
01:43:40,815 --> 01:43:42,609
I know.

1576
01:43:44,862 --> 01:43:46,529
Do you want me to come down there?

1577
01:43:47,030 --> 01:43:51,784
No, I think it's a good idea to stay with
the kids and, you know, be with them.

1578
01:43:51,952 --> 01:43:53,787
And I'm just gonna...

1579
01:44:03,796 --> 01:44:05,423
I love you, John.

1580
01:44:06,841 --> 01:44:08,636
I love you.

1581
01:44:13,806 --> 01:44:15,184
Hi.

1582
01:44:15,350 --> 01:44:17,019
- I'm gonna give you some time.
- Okay.

1583
01:44:17,185 --> 01:44:20,523
- I'll be right outside if you need me.
- All right. Thanks.

1584
01:44:22,815 --> 01:44:25,360
Look what I got for you.

1585
01:44:25,903 --> 01:44:27,154
Remember this?

1586
01:44:28,697 --> 01:44:32,701
Look what Colleen sent you.
You remember that?

1587
01:44:32,868 --> 01:44:36,747
You remember chewing up that ear? No.

1588
01:44:36,913 --> 01:44:40,333
It's tough to remember all the things
you've chewed up, isn't it?

1589
01:44:40,833 --> 01:44:43,170
It all starts to kind of run together.

1590
01:45:17,453 --> 01:45:21,041
It's okay.
You don't have to do anything.

1591
01:45:22,126 --> 01:45:25,212
You don't have your usual energy.

1592
01:45:25,796 --> 01:45:29,425
You remember how we were
always saying what a pain you are?

1593
01:45:29,591 --> 01:45:32,511
That you're the world's worst dog?

1594
01:45:34,430 --> 01:45:35,890
Don't believe it.

1595
01:45:36,599 --> 01:45:38,641
Don't believe it, even for a minute...

1596
01:45:38,809 --> 01:45:42,145
...because you know
we couldn't find a better dog.

1597
01:45:44,731 --> 01:45:47,902
You know,
what made you such a great dog...

1598
01:45:48,068 --> 01:45:51,822
...is that you loved us every day,
no matter what.

1599
01:45:51,988 --> 01:45:54,033
That's an amazing thing.

1600
01:45:54,533 --> 01:45:57,161
You know how much we love you?

1601
01:45:57,328 --> 01:45:59,747
We love you so much.

1602
01:46:03,458 --> 01:46:06,002
We love you more than anything.

1603
01:46:07,421 --> 01:46:12,592
I don't know exactly where we go
from here...

1604
01:46:13,135 --> 01:46:16,387
...but I want you to remember
you're a great dog, Marley.

1605
01:46:16,805 --> 01:46:19,557
You're a great dog.

1606
01:46:31,444 --> 01:46:33,697
He won't feel this. He'll just slip away.

1607
01:46:34,448 --> 01:46:35,949
You ready?

1608
01:46:38,284 --> 01:46:40,453
- Yeah, we're ready.
- Okay.

1609
01:48:44,286 --> 01:48:48,207
Okay. Get down.

1610
01:48:49,082 --> 01:48:50,542
Ah.

1611
01:48:52,920 --> 01:48:56,590
- He's wrapped in his blanket.
Yeah, so he can stay warm.

1612
01:48:57,591 --> 01:48:59,717
Do you guys
wanna read what you wrote?

1613
01:49:01,345 --> 01:49:06,307
Mine's a picture of me and Marley,
grasshoppers and ice cream.

1614
01:49:06,475 --> 01:49:08,394
Mommy wrote what I said.

1615
01:49:08,560 --> 01:49:13,858
"Dear Marley,
I will never forget you forever. Colleen. "

1616
01:49:14,274 --> 01:49:16,694
And these are kisses.

1617
01:49:16,860 --> 01:49:19,154
- That's beautiful.
Thank you.

1618
01:49:19,320 --> 01:49:24,284
You wanna put it in? He'll like that.
Set it down.

1619
01:49:26,662 --> 01:49:30,164
Good. That's a great picture.

1620
01:49:30,332 --> 01:49:31,958
Conor, do you wanna...?

1621
01:49:35,462 --> 01:49:38,215
"Dear Marley, I loved you all my life.

1622
01:49:38,381 --> 01:49:41,594
I hope you like heaven,
and that there's lots to chew on.

1623
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:45,139
Your brother, Conor Richard Grogan. "

1624
01:49:48,684 --> 01:49:50,810
That's a good letter.

1625
01:49:51,604 --> 01:49:55,315
Patrick, do you wanna say something?

1626
01:49:56,984 --> 01:49:58,944
He knows.

1627
01:50:02,530 --> 01:50:04,824
I'd like to give him something.

1628
01:50:11,039 --> 01:50:13,000
This necklace.

1629
01:50:14,667 --> 01:50:17,003
It's been on quite a journey.

1630
01:50:23,844 --> 01:50:26,180
Your dad gave it to me...

1631
01:50:27,472 --> 01:50:30,725
...to celebrate the beginning
of our family.

1632
01:50:30,893 --> 01:50:32,645
But, you know...

1633
01:50:33,895 --> 01:50:36,689
...our family had really already begun.

1634
01:50:44,030 --> 01:50:45,533
Bye, Clearance Puppy.

1635
01:51:12,893 --> 01:51:15,061
A dog has no use for fancy cars...

1636
01:51:15,229 --> 01:51:18,106
...or big homes or designer clothes.

1637
01:51:18,274 --> 01:51:21,734
