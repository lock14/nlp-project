1
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:44,501
-Yo, run the ball, fool!
-Come on, now.

2
00:00:44,669 --> 00:00:46,962
That's good. Good.
Do it.

3
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:45,015
Welcome to the WBGO Journal.
I'm Doug Doyle.

4
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:47,059
-Hey, Vicky.
-How you doing, Miss Jenkins?

5
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,477
I'm good, girl.

6
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,189
-No.
-No, you can't do that.

7
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,406
It's the man, right here.

8
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:05,118
-Five-0 say freeze!
-All right.

9
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:07,663
-Good seeing you, man.
-What's up, guys?

10
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:10,666
-How you doing, baby?
-Not good as you, D.

11
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:13,252
How come nobody around here
ever calls me "baby"?

12
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:16,296
-How you doing, baby?
-I'm doing good.

13
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:18,674
So, ladies, you seen
your brother Rafik anywhere?

14
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:20,717
What did he do now?

15
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:23,303
-Hey, Big Daddy.
-Rev, you good, man?

16
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:25,514
When you gonna
install these refrigerators?

17
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:28,934
We had to lock two boneheads up
last night for breaking in these crates.

18
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:32,396
Yeah, besides, some kid tries to
play house, could end up suffocated.

19
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:35,524
The maintenance fellow is on strike.
What am I supposed to do?

20
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:36,900
Put them in myself?

21
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:40,195
Lorenzo, you know those laptops
we ordered for the Rainbow Club?

22
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:44,032
-They didn't come with power cords.
-Talk to your housing manager here.

23
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,035
-How we supposed to use them?
-Ladies, tell Rafik to find me...

24
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:49,913
-...before I find him, all right?
-All right.

25
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:52,040
Lorenzo?

26
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,381
I need for you to have
a man-to-man with Billy.

27
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,049
About what?

28
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,385
He started hitting me.

29
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:05,095
Can you believe that?

30
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:08,598
You scared?

31
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:15,564
All right. I'll sit his dumb ass down
and talk to him, okay?

32
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:17,649
Thank you.

33
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,901
-Yo, Rev, I'm out, babe.
-All right, baby.

34
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:22,654
-Good seeing you, bro.
-All right, baby.

35
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:25,741
Oh, Rafik. Just the knucklehead
I was looking for.

36
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:27,576
Right here, son.

37
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,411
Come on down.

38
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,580
You know what this is?

39
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:35,167
-A warrant.
-No. It's a Gannon warrant.

40
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,835
You didn't show for your hearing.

41
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,046
Hearing for what,
driving while black?

42
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:42,924
-Can you talk to him tonight? Please.
-Okay, okay. I'm gonna do it, all right?

43
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:48,764
Did you or did you not get stopped
in that town at 2 a.m...

44
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:50,766
...got a nickel bag of weed on you?

45
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:52,392
-A nickel bag?
-What you doing...

46
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:55,103
...cruising through Gannon
in the middle of the night?

47
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:58,940
I was going home, son. Doing
the speed limit and everything. DWB.

48
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:02,110
You know how those rookies over
in Gannon are. They stop me.

49
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:04,696
-So you know.
-Hey, hey, hey. Don't try to relate.

50
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:07,574
First of all, lose the weed.
Now, they doing us a favor...

51
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:10,702
...letting us bring you in so your
booking will go smooth, feel me?

52
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:14,164
-I feel you.
-Jesus, I hate this fucking place.

53
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:18,251
I am not gonna take any shit
for hopping the fence this time either.

54
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:20,379
No, it's cool. I'll handle it.

55
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:23,673
Rev, Bobby. Big Daddy,
how you be?

56
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:25,634
Well, same old, same old.
What's up?

57
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:28,887
Thought you said you guys were
gonna grab Rafik Dotson for us.

58
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,264
I did. And we will.

59
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:35,310
Hey. He said we would do it.

60
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:39,606
Yeah, no, no. We're not here for him.
We're picking us up...

61
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,483
...a Calvin Joy.

62
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:45,821
You know, you guys are supposed
to contact the local officers...

63
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:47,239
...before you come in here.

64
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:50,492
Rev, I just did.

65
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,417
I'm gonna go up with them.

66
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,629
-Base to South Investigator 15.
-South 15, go.

67
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:05,841
South 15, respond
to Medical Centre Emergency Room.

68
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:08,969
See female vic of
a possible carjack at that location.

69
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:10,679
On our way.

70
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,014
Where the hell did Rafik go?

71
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:16,184
All units. Wanted: a carjacking
in the south district.

72
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:19,020
1994 Toyota Camry,
four-door, color beige...

73
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:23,567
...New Jersey reg

74
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:27,821
Vehicle occupied by black male,
5-foot-8 to 5-foot-10.

75
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:30,866
Last seen driving out
the Armstrong Houses.

76
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:44,212
Lorenzo.

77
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:50,010
-Y'all see anything out here?
-No.

78
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:52,137
No. No, I ain't seen nothing.

79
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:55,140
-Anybody see anything?
-No.

80
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,225
-Lorenzo.
-What?

81
00:07:57,393 --> 00:08:00,103
-Don't forget.
-Forget what?

82
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:06,234
Bobby, I'm going to the hospital.

83
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:08,236
-I'll be back for you.
-Twenty received.

84
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:42,020
-Thanks for waiting.
-Yeah, I'm checking on my mother.

85
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,772
-She came in about an hour ago.
-Yes.

86
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,067
How you ladies doing?

87
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:49,402
Putting on some weight
there, Lorenzo.

88
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,279
Just more of me to love.

89
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:53,406
-Young man.
-Young man yourself.

90
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:55,116
How's my customer?
She good to talk?

91
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:57,077
Yeah, bay three.

92
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:58,954
I need you to put these in....

93
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:02,290
You say black. Black like
darker than him, lighter than him?

94
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,417
I don't know. It was night.

95
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:08,380
Five-eight, 5'10",
running about 150.

96
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,882
-You still feel that?
-Yeah.

97
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,300
Guys?

98
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:14,135
Brenda, this is Detective Council.

99
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:16,304
Detective Council,
this is Brenda Martin.

100
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:20,642
-How you doing, Brenda?
-Not good.

101
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:28,900
Detective Council's gonna
take it from here, okay?

102
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:33,196
-Can I get you anything?
-No.

103
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:36,116
Now, look.

104
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:40,453
I know you're upset and tired as hell,
but the sooner we go through this...

105
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:43,665
...the sooner we can make
something good happen, all right?

106
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:50,630
Look, Brenda, would you rather have
a female investigator in here?

107
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,465
Would that make you
more comfortable?

108
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:55,510
I wasn't raped,
if that's what you're driving at.

109
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:59,848
Oh, that's good.
I'm real glad to hear that.

110
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:03,518
Look, the other officers already,
you know...

111
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:05,812
...got the description of the car
and the actor.

112
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,523
And everybody's on the street
looking for this guy.

113
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:11,651
But if you'll just bear with me,
you know, kind of...

114
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:15,363
...take me through the story
one more time.

115
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:21,286
I was trying to get from the projects
back into Gannon. I live in Gannon.

116
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,038
You shut up! And shut up now!

117
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:30,211
I was on Hurley at
the bottom of the hill, you know...

118
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:33,882
...Martyrs Park, where the street ends?
And I had heard you could...

119
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,176
...cut through Martyrs
and come out in Gannon...

120
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:37,886
...but I'd never done it before.

121
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,472
So I'm, like, halfway in,
and it's, like, where's--?

122
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,642
And then there's no road.
So I was starting to back out...

123
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:46,144
...and this guy come from
behind a tree or something.

124
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,897
And I didn't wanna deal with him.
But before I--

125
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,024
I know it,
he comes up to the window.

126
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:54,194
And he opens my car door...

127
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:57,238
...and says, "Just-- Just look.
Look where I'm pointing."

128
00:10:57,406 --> 00:11:00,742
Like I should get out of the car.
And I know better.

129
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,036
Before I knew it, he yanks me
out of the car.

130
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:04,704
And he pulls me down so hard.

131
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:09,417
You don't know. I tried.
I tried to tell him.

132
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,837
Tried to tell him what, Brenda?

133
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,800
Okay, look. Now, I gotta ask.

134
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:19,803
And I want you to know,
it doesn't matter what your answer is...

135
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:22,889
...all I'm concerned with is trying
to find the guy who hurt you.

136
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:26,601
White girl from Gannon. What was I
doing there at night, copping rock?

137
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:29,270
You're strictly the victim.
I need to know who to hit on.

138
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:31,981
I'm clean almost five years.
I don't even think about it.

139
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:33,441
Okay.

140
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:36,361
-And my brother's on the job.
-Really? Where?

141
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,697
Gannon. He's a detective.
Danny Martin.

142
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,117
Danny Martin.

143
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,953
Yeah, okay. All right. Yeah, good.

144
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:47,831
What was I doing there
if I wasn't buying drugs?

145
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:50,583
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

146
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:54,713
I work in the Children's Centre.
The Rainbow Club in Three Building.

147
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,257
Okay, good. That's good.
Now, excuse me.

148
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:01,386
-This is Sl15 to Base.
-Base. Go ahead.

149
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:05,598
I need a reach-out to Gannon,
a Detective Danny Martin.

150
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:08,268
Have him contact me
at the Dempsy MC.

151
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:10,562
-Received.
-Okay, Brenda.

152
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,897
I went home
and I couldn't find my glasses.

153
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:15,567
I thought I left them
at the Rainbow Club.

154
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:19,571
But I didn't, so I got
in the car...

155
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:21,322
...and I drove.

156
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:24,492
You drove, and...?

157
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,327
I told you the rest.

158
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,832
You know, Brenda, I--

159
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,918
I can't help but think there's
something else still bothering you.

160
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:37,046
You sure you don't want
a female investigator here?

161
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:45,054
Do you know the guy
who did this to you, Brenda?

162
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:54,606
Hey, hey, hey.
Brenda, stop, stop, stop.

163
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:57,650
Do you know who this man is?

164
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:02,489
Listen, this is your lucky night.

165
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:05,366
I know everybody
in the Armstrong projects.

166
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:08,536
I own that place.
Ain't nobody I don't know.

167
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:11,706
Do you know who did this to you?
Who's the guy, Brenda?

168
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:16,544
I'm dying. I'm dying! I'm dying!

169
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:20,215
My son.

170
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:22,967
Your son? Your son what?

171
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:25,136
Is in the car.

172
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:37,649
No! No!

173
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:44,197
Brenda, your kid,
he's a boy, right?

174
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,407
-How old?
-Four.

175
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:47,992
-What's his name?
-Cody.

176
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,079
-Okay. Cody. Cody. How old is he?
-I just told you.

177
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:54,666
Oh, that's right. Slow down, Lorenzo,
slow down. Four years old.

178
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,876
-Okay. Is he in a car seat?
-No.

179
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:58,169
-Seat belt?
-No.

180
00:13:58,337 --> 00:13:59,379
-Front or back?
-Of?

181
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:00,922
-The car!
-Oh. Oh, back.

182
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,591
Okay. Hold on, hold on.
Hold on one second.

183
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:07,387
This is Special Investigator 15 to Base.
Stand by for emergency transmission.

184
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:09,597
-Base, go.
-Carjack in the south district...

185
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:14,018
...notify all units that
there is a male child in the car.

186
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:16,771
A 4-year-old--
Is he Caucasian?

187
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:20,775
--Caucasian male, 4 years old,
in the back seat.

188
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:22,527
-Received.
-He was asleep.

189
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,572
-He was-- He was sick. He was--
-Hold on, Brenda. Hold on.

190
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:28,908
Hold on, hold on.
The child is or was asleep...

191
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,536
...so he may or may not be
visible to pursuing officers.

192
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:34,581
-Stand by for further description.
-I tried to tell him.

193
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:37,959
What was he wearing, Brenda?
What's he wearing? Your son.

194
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,878
What is your son wearing?

195
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:45,216
He had a-- He had a--
He had a white-- White shirt on.

196
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,843
A white-- A white shirt on.

197
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:48,469
-Light or dark?
-White!

198
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:49,888
-Hair.
-Short in front...

199
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:52,432
...and long in black--
Back!

200
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:54,601
-Pants or jeans?
-Pyjama bottoms with stripes.

201
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:58,062
Pyjama bottoms with stripes. Okay.
All right, hold on, hold on.

202
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:03,693
Shit! Special Investigator 15
to Base.

203
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:07,572
Child has black hair, white shirt
and pajama bottoms.

204
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:11,284
-Your kid's asleep, right, Brenda?
-He's asleep.

205
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:13,953
All right. Okay, now...

206
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:16,873
...listen to me. This knucklehead,
all he wants is your car.

207
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,542
If he wanted to hurt somebody,
he would have hurt you.

208
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,754
-No, he did hurt me.
-All right. Here, listen to me, Brenda.

209
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:26,466
He's gonna see that kid, pull over to
a corner and put him on the sidewalk.

210
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:28,593
He don't want no parts of that kid.

211
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:36,351
Shit! All right. Now listen,
I gotta ask you one more time.

212
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:39,312
-What were you doing there?
-No, I-- I told you.

213
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,314
-Why were you there?
-I told you.

214
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:43,107
-Well, tell me again!
-I told you.

215
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,818
Told me what? Tell me what
you were doing! Tell me again!

216
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:47,487
I went to find my glasses.

217
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:49,864
You took your sick kid
out at 9 in the evening...

218
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:53,368
-...for some fucking glasses?!
-I-- I don't have a babysitter!

219
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:56,537
I can't afford one. What
are you trying to do, punish me?

220
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:59,207
-Sit. All right. Sit.
-Believe me, you don't have to.

221
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,042
I'm tight. I'm tight. All right?

222
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:03,670
-Oh, God.
-Oh, well, what if he wakes up?

223
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:05,964
He'll be so scared.
I'm never not there for him.

224
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:10,551
Listen, I know this is hard for you.
But we are going to find him, okay?

225
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:12,804
-I let him down.
-Nobody wants a kidnap tag.

226
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:17,392
He's my world, and I let him down.
He's worth 10 of anybody else.

227
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:21,896
He's worth 10 of me!
What--? What are you doing?

228
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:25,316
Adrenaline. Straight, no chaser.

229
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:29,487
Detective Council, there's a Detective
Martin from Gannon out here.

230
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,239
All right. Can you stay with her?

231
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:34,075
-Yeah, sure.
-Okay. Be back. Be right back.

232
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,084
Is that your daughter?

233
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:46,504
She's beautiful.

234
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:51,884
What happened?

235
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:54,721
Your sister got jacked
over in the Armstrong Houses.

236
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:56,264
She got a little roughed up.

237
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:59,684
And we think her son, Cody,
is still in the back seat of the car.

238
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,562
-Car? The guy's still out there?
-We got a crash alert going.

239
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:03,771
He won't get far.

240
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:07,608
-Where in Armstrong, high end or low?
-I know where you're coming from...

241
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:10,695
...but your sister needs to be
with family. Think you could stay?

242
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:14,532
-I'll ask you again. High end or low?
-It's not your jurisdiction, man.

243
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:17,535
But I give you my word, I will do--

244
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:21,539
Hey, Council. You at least got
a photo of who you're looking for?

245
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:24,625
Ain't that many pictures
of jackers in the book.

246
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:27,962
No. I mean him.

247
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:40,808
-Sl15 to Sl20. Go to six.
-Twenty on six.

248
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:45,772
She had to go to the john.

249
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:49,233
What part of "stay with her"
did you not understand?

250
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:52,153
What's happening, Big Daddy?

251
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:54,989
Big heads up.
The vic is Danny Martin's sister.

252
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:57,825
So you believe Gannon's gonna be
hopping the fence in force.

253
00:17:57,993 --> 00:18:00,828
No shit. They're already here.

254
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:03,289
I'll be down as soon as I can.

255
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:05,833
No. No, don't come down here.
You'll only go batshit.

256
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:08,294
You'll make everything
10 times worse.

257
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:12,924
Listen, just take her over to BCI,
all right? And I'll handle this, please.

258
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,677
Brenda?

259
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:26,854
Go to their supply cabinet and....

260
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,991
Ten-four. Ten-nine-two, eight-eight.

261
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:54,335
Armstrong residents,
this is a lockdown.

262
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:56,045
Do not cross the barricade.

263
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,966
Armstrong residents.
This is a lockdown.

264
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:02,760
For you to join the ranks
of these people, to continue...

265
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,178
...to oppress us like this!

266
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:07,473
We have had six homicides
in these homes in the last three years.

267
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:10,184
Three of them
children under 18 years of age.

268
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:11,978
And not once did we ever...

269
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:14,272
...have the police presence
we got here tonight...

270
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:17,650
...for one missing white child!
Can you explain that to me?

271
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:20,528
--abductor, please approach
one of the officers.

272
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:23,781
If you have any information about
the whereabouts of Cody Martin...

273
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,283
...or his abductor, please--

274
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:29,370
Lorenzo. My mother
is having an angina attack.

275
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:31,122
-And they letting nobody out.
-What?

276
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,375
Now, I am gonna get her
to a hospital if I have to fucking--

277
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:35,876
Bea, it's all right.

278
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:39,213
You get your mother and her things.
I'll see she gets to the hospital.

279
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:41,299
I know what you're doing here.

280
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:45,303
And I'm telling you, you cannot
get involved with all this and help her.

281
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,889
Now get the hell out of here. Take her
over to BCI and do your job, man.

282
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,184
-Where the hell is she?
-Shit.

283
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:56,188
-Hey! Hey!
-Medic. Come on!

284
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:57,398
Hey!

285
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:59,442
-Make a path. Make a path.
-Move it!

286
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,069
-My bag.
-Forget it. Forget it.

287
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:05,239
Hey, what are you doing, huh?
Looking for a clue?

288
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:07,241
-It's a fucking freeway.
-Watch your mouth.

289
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:09,201
Yeah. And, you,
are you out of your mind?

290
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:12,371
-What were you doing out here?
-Danny, please, I swear--

291
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:14,081
Hey. Your sister's suffering here.

292
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:16,083
I don't see no axe
sticking out her head.

293
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:18,169
He's my son, you fuck!

294
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:20,588
Let me tell you something, Council.

295
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:23,132
This shithead's in the wind,
and he ain't coming back.

296
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,384
But if it happened here,
the answer's here.

297
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:28,596
And we're gonna shut this place
down like East fucking Berlin...

298
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:31,307
...until somebody gives it up.
Now, all I want to know...

299
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:34,268
...is are you working Armstrong
or just protecting it?

300
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:40,232
The police are requesting
your help with any information....

301
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,526
Get him out of here.
Get all of them out of here.

302
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:46,155
Lorenzo, it's his nephew. Reverse the
situation, we'd be over there in a shot.

303
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:48,783
For an Armstrong kid?
I fucking doubt it.

304
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:51,243
No, Calvin!

305
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:54,121
-Oh, God!
-Don't do it, Calvin!

306
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:56,290
-Don't do it.
-Do it.

307
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:58,084
Coming through.

308
00:22:58,251 --> 00:23:00,795
-Make way, people.
-Calvin! No, Calvin. No!

309
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:03,547
Yo, C! Come on, man!

310
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:05,466
No!

311
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:08,469
-They threw him out the window.
-They pushed him out the window.

312
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:11,138
-All right, stand back.
-Back up, y'all. Back up.

313
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:13,933
-Calvin Joy. Possession with intent.
-What did you do, huh?

314
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:16,060
-What did you do?
-We never got in the door.

315
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,771
Three knocks, this nitwit pulls
a Monte Cristo. Fuck you.

316
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:21,649
Fuck me? You son of a bitch!
I'll show you "fuck you"!

317
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:23,484
Son of a bitch! I'll kill you.

318
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:29,198
Fuck you! Fuck you!

319
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:31,075
-I'm taking you off this one.
-Don't.

320
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,327
-I'm taking you off!
-Don't, lieutenant, don't.

321
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:36,831
-Armstrong is mine.
-No, she's yours!

322
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:38,999
What's wrong with you,
bringing her back here?

323
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:40,668
Get her looking at mug shots yet?

324
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:42,628
-No.
-You sit her with a sketch artist?

325
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:43,963
She's yours!

326
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,800
-I love him so much.
-Come on, come on.

327
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,594
Come on, Big Daddy, chill out.
Come on.

328
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:54,014
-I love him so much.
-I know you do, Brenda. I know you do.

329
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:58,018
I wish-- I wish--

330
00:23:58,186 --> 00:24:02,189
I still wanna work here. I wanna--
I wanna work harder.

331
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:04,191
I have so much love in me.

332
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:06,485
I know you do, Brenda.
I know you do.

333
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:11,699
-What do I do? What do I do?
-Thanks, ladies. Let's go, Brenda.

334
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:16,203
All right. Everybody,
make room, please.

335
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:19,623
-What's wrong with you?
-You are two heartbeats from a lockup.

336
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,083
You're gonna lock me up now?

337
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:22,751
Take me now, and lock me up.

338
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:24,837
Lock me up.
That's what you should do...

339
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:27,089
...you old hillbilly-ass cracker!

340
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:33,220
Can't you do something about this?

341
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:38,601
You can't lock people up
in their own neighborhood!

342
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:40,728
-Step behind the barricade.
-Fuck them!

343
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:43,898
-Take these barricades out!
-I'm not talking till you step back.

344
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:45,900
You're not talking to me?
Fine, I'll talk.

345
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:47,902
-Do you see him?
-Hey, look....

346
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:51,906
Just go and get him, take him upstairs
before he gets in trouble, all right?

347
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:56,577
-You know where she lives?
-Yeah, why?

348
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:58,579
Meet me over there, huh?

349
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:02,750
You step off!
No, this is my neighborhood!

350
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:05,252
These are my projects.
I'm not going nowhere.

351
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,296
No, I'm not going nowhere.

352
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:24,939
-Billy, come on!
-No!

353
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:27,608
-You think you is, man?
-Come on.

354
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:36,367
Go home!

355
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:40,371
Attention, Armstrong residents,
this is a lockdown.

356
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:42,122
Please remain behind the barriers...

357
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:44,708
...while police conduct
their investigation.

358
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:46,418
Detective, is that Cody's mom?

359
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:50,381
-Do you think it was deliberate?
-Get the hell out of here.

360
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:53,801
Come on, Detective Council.
Look over here.

361
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:02,643
This is a lockdown.
Please remain behind the barriers.

362
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:21,245
-I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do.
-We gotta go.

363
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:10,210
-No, please.
-All right, all right.

364
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:51,293
You know, I was thinking.

365
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,713
Once I said,
"Cody, do you love me?"

366
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:57,341
And you know what he said?
He's 4, right.

367
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,343
He said, "Of course I love you,
Mommy.

368
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,762
Why would you even ask me that?"

369
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:05,265
All right, I'll see if they'll post a
Gannon detective downstairs for you.

370
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:07,184
The sketch artist is on his way over.

371
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:10,562
He's gonna do the jacker.
I'll get Felicia to come stay with you.

372
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:12,147
Okay.

373
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:14,733
Get some sleep.

374
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:16,777
Okay.

375
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:24,618
Felicia.

376
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:35,421
You see him?

377
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:37,464
-You see him?
-Yeah.

378
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:40,342
Look, I promise I'll deal with it.

379
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:44,263
That sketch artist is on his way over.
As soon as he's done...

380
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:46,765
...make sure her head
is on a pillow. Okay?

381
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:50,769
Lorenzo.

382
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:52,646
I don't know anybody
in those houses...

383
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:54,565
...who would have laid a
hand on Brenda.

384
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:57,484
She was known.
She was respected.

385
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:59,319
All right.

386
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:03,157
-Thanks for this.
-Sure.

387
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:12,875
Say, partner, you good to drive?

388
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:16,336
-What?
-You good to drive?

389
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:17,921
Well, hell, yeah.

390
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:21,175
Tell you what,
why don't you take a power nap?

391
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:26,680
-I'll bring these back in an hour.
-Man, what the hell are you doing?

392
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:14,394
If you're trying to get
my attention, you got it.

393
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:16,396
How you doing, Detective Council?

394
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:18,732
-You're a reporter?
-Me? No.

395
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,818
Karen Collucci. Friends of Kent.

396
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:22,736
Friends of K--?

397
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:29,034
Oh, you those people go around
looking for missing children and such.

398
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:31,161
We find them.

399
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:34,414
Remember Corey Baker
over in Bayonne?

400
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:38,585
-And Nedra Davis in Jersey City?
-Yeah. They were killed.

401
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:41,088
I know. We found them.

402
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:45,259
Anyways, if you think it would help,
and if the mother agrees...

403
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:48,178
...we'd like to help you
find Cody Martin.

404
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:51,890
-No, I don't think so.
-Okay. No problem.

405
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:55,602
How about you take one of our cards
in case you change your mind?

406
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:06,029
You know, I'd bet everything
I have that...

407
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:07,698
...Tania Leeds...

408
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:10,117
...been dead from the jump.

409
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:14,288
Probably. But whoever did her
is still out there, right?

410
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:21,128
Anyways, it's the anniversary, so we're
hoping somebody'd step up, but....

411
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:26,133
You look half-dead, Lorenzo.
Hope you can get some sleep.

412
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,293
Check it out.

413
00:32:02,795 --> 00:32:05,297
Who the hell is that, now?
Buddha or some-fucking-body?

414
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:08,592
What? It's Tupac, man.

415
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,552
It's Pac.

416
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:13,555
Jayce, man, come on.

417
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:15,849
This is your body,
not some billboard.

418
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:18,560
Well, I was about
to get Tiger Woods...

419
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:22,522
...but I figured that wouldn't go over
too well with the brothers in here.

420
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:25,525
I'm sorry, man. Time's up.

421
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:28,195
Finish up over here, folks.

422
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,496
Watch your back, all right?

423
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:39,331
You too, Pops.

424
00:32:56,557 --> 00:32:59,726
This is ridiculous!
They have to go to school!

425
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:02,145
-You don't understand.
-Come on!

426
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:03,897
We're trying.

427
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:06,316
--the search for the missing child,
Cody Martin.

428
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:19,204
I'm tired of this.

429
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:21,498
Just give me a break, okay?
You gotta move back.

430
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:26,753
Tell me, how's this supposed
to help?

431
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:29,256
You're doing nothing but
harassing innocent people.

432
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:31,258
Three years ago,
Belmont Houses...

433
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:34,761
...maintenance man gets shot, 700
windows overlooking the scene.

434
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:37,139
We shut it down, what,
a day, day and a half...

435
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:39,975
...they brought us the actor
on a platter. That was my call.

436
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:42,519
Yeah, but what if nobody
around here knows nothing?

437
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,563
If this was anywhere
other than Armstrong--

438
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:48,108
If this was anywhere than Armstrong
Housing, I would have yanked you.

439
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:51,862
-Now, the mother. Is she a scumbag?
-No, I don't think so.

440
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,905
So if she's the actor,
will she hang tough?

441
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:56,366
-No, I don't.
-It's time to take a hard run at her.

442
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:57,784
You think?

443
00:33:57,952 --> 00:33:59,953
Back it up, back it up.

444
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:02,289
He has no statement.

445
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:04,916
You know, Bobby,
if this woman is faking it...

446
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:07,085
...she's in the wrong line of work.

447
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:09,087
There is one thing that
keeps bugging me.

448
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:11,798
All right, so I go by the hospital
last night, right?

449
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:16,303
She says she got beat on by
a black man, 5'8", 150 pounds.

450
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:18,764
Now here comes me.
Black as a coal miner's ass...

451
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:21,641
...at midnight and twice that size.
I roll right up on her.

452
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:24,144
You know what she does?
She shakes my hand.

453
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:27,064
She should've taken a look at me
and jumped out of her skin.

454
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:29,608
But, no, she shakes
my motherfucking hand.

455
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:33,028
Lorenzo. You wanna do yourself
a big favor?

456
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:35,322
-Give her to me.
-You?

457
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:37,365
Yeah. Look, if she
don't give it up soon...

458
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:40,827
...with this going on, all these people,
they're gonna come down on you.

459
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:42,579
It's wrong.

460
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:46,333
--call the Dempsy Police
at 201-153....

461
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:48,668
-All right.
-Hey. Big Daddy!

462
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:53,882
-You gonna do anything about this?
-Yeah, what you gonna do, man?

463
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:59,012
I'm here at the Armstrong Houses on
the border of Gannon and Dempsy.

464
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:02,182
Tempers are beginning to flare.
This is day two of the search...

465
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,768
...for 4-year-old Gannon resident
Cody Martin.

466
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:08,230
Police suspect his abductor
is here in the Armstrong Houses.

467
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:10,565
We will continue our coverage
through the day...

468
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:12,526
...bringing you news as it breaks.

469
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:16,446
This is Victor Diaz reporting
to you from Channel 9.

470
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:18,198
-Danny.
-Brenda, listen to me.

471
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:20,325
-Leave me alone.
-Brenda, please.

472
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:22,702
-Why's it always gotta be like this?
-Stop, no.

473
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:24,579
Every time I see you, I put out a fire.

474
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:26,498
-Tell me what happened.
-Leave me alone.

475
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:28,959
Brenda, please.
Tell me what happened.

476
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:33,004
-I said, 50 times.
-Yeah, I know. Say it again.

477
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:38,093
Brenda. Please,
we are chasing ghosts out there.

478
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:41,888
Where's the kid? Where's the car?
We can't even find--

479
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:44,975
-Are you getting high again?
-No!

480
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:47,060
-You can tell me. I won't get angry.
-No!

481
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:50,021
"No, I'm not doing dope,"
or, "No, I won't tell you"?

482
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:51,731
No, leave me alone!

483
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:54,734
What the hell is wrong with you?
Can't you even raise a child?

484
00:35:58,906 --> 00:36:00,574
Brenda, I'm sorry, but, please--

485
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:05,078
Brenda. I'm sorry, but--
Brenda, I'm your brother.

486
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:08,248
I love you. Just tell me
what happened.

487
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:12,961
Jesus Christ!

488
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:16,840
He came in here.
I didn't know what to do.

489
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,466
Did you find him?

490
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:21,511
No. No, not yet.

491
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:29,561
I'm gonna take you back
to Armstrong.

492
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:32,814
You can see the scene
during the daytime, okay?

493
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:37,360
-How's that look to you?
-Did they arrest anyone?

494
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:39,196
No, not yet.

495
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:04,304
Wait! Miss Martin!

496
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:06,264
Have they found Cody?

497
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:15,482
Miss Martin, please!

498
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:36,753
Yo, what's the deal, Zo?
What's the deal, huh?

499
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:39,130
-That your girl, Zo?
-Let her loose, man.

500
00:37:39,298 --> 00:37:41,383
Let her loose, Zo.

501
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,887
Put your heavy away.
We ain't doing nothing.

502
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:47,514
Just keep on walking.

503
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:52,477
This place is locked down
and you know it.

504
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:54,312
We didn't do nothing!

505
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:13,456
-How's it look to you from up here?
-What are they doing?

506
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:15,500
Brenda. Show me.

507
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:18,044
Point out where you
tried to cut through the park.

508
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:20,255
Exactly where that guy
came on to you.

509
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:22,924
How can I tell? It was night.

510
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:30,765
Okay, Brenda,
I gotta ask you something.

511
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:34,644
If I don't, I wouldn't be doing my job.

512
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:39,024
Two-thirds of the kids missing,
the person that called it in...

513
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:41,568
...is usually the person
that made the kid go missing.

514
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:44,988
-So I gotta ask.
-What, did I kill my son?

515
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:51,411
I have-- Since I've been little,
I have been nothing.

516
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:55,457
Less than nothing.
In-- In my family, in-- In the world...

517
00:38:55,624 --> 00:38:58,585
...the only time anybody noticed me
was when I fucked something up.

518
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:02,297
Dropped out of college, lost a job,
lost an apartment, did drugs.

519
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:04,924
When I had to move back
into my childhood bedroom...

520
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:06,926
...because I didn't have
a penny to my name.

521
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:12,182
And when they did notice me, my
so-called people, my family?

522
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,851
The eyes, the smirks.

523
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:18,938
But you know when all that stopped?

524
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:21,816
For them? For me?

525
00:39:21,984 --> 00:39:23,943
When I had my son.

526
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:26,112
When I had Cody.

527
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:30,450
As soon-- As soon as I had him
in my arms, I became, like, more.

528
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:33,828
I became like--
Like, "Fuck you, fuck all of you!

529
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:38,416
You cannot touch this! You cannot be
this-- This-- This baby's mother, me!

530
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:40,126
I am that!"

531
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:42,629
So did I kill him?

532
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:46,132
He gave birth to me.

533
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:48,093
He made me.

534
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,136
I would slaughter myself
10 times over...

535
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:52,931
...before I would touch
a hair on his head.

536
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:57,727
Nothing you can
tell me that would help?

537
00:39:57,895 --> 00:39:59,938
Can't you stop it?

538
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:03,525
I would if I could, Brenda...

539
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:09,280
...but it's got a life of its own now.

540
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:21,334
I tell you, 22 years of policing
in this city...

541
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:24,921
...things I see day in, day out...

542
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:29,801
...makes it very, very hard
to have faith in humanity.

543
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:34,472
But I do believe in God.

544
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:39,018
I believe that whatever happens to us,
the good things, the bad things...

545
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:42,522
...they all happen
because God wills it.

546
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:45,817
Like this thing with your son.

547
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:48,194
You know, looking for your son.

548
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:53,992
Now I know somewhere in the back
of your mind is the great, great fear...

549
00:40:54,201 --> 00:40:57,871
...that things are gonna
turn out unhappy.

550
00:40:58,038 --> 00:41:00,206
Well, me too, Brenda.

551
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,333
Me too.

552
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,878
But you got to take strength.

553
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:09,382
You gotta believe that if something,
you know, happened...

554
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,676
...if that's the case...

555
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:15,054
...it's because God
wanted that little boy...

556
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:17,390
...like he's gonna want
all of us one day.

557
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:21,728
And it ain't nobody's fault.
Wasn't nothing nobody could do.

558
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:24,564
But know this, Brenda.

559
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:29,777
I will not rest until I find your son.

560
00:41:29,945 --> 00:41:32,071
And the person that--

561
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:36,242
The person that he was last with.

562
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:45,376
You know, the more we try to know,
the more mysterious life gets.

563
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:51,090
Sometimes there's nothing else
to do but just let go.

564
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:54,385
You just gotta let go...

565
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:56,971
...and let God.

566
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:22,288
Come here.

567
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:28,211
Look at that.

568
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:34,801
This place is ticking
like a time bomb.

569
00:42:35,844 --> 00:42:38,680
Now, you know what that means
because you ain't no tourist.

570
00:42:38,847 --> 00:42:41,808
In fact, from what I hear, you get
much love around here, right?

571
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:43,393
-I'm so tired.
-Brenda, Brenda.

572
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:45,144
Brenda, Brenda. Brenda...

573
00:42:45,312 --> 00:42:49,274
...I want to find your son.
That's first.

574
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:52,485
But I wanna find him
before anybody gets hurt.

575
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:55,780
Now, we're banging our heads
against the wall on this thing.

576
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:59,033
We're doing all we can,
so if there's anything you can say...

577
00:42:59,201 --> 00:43:03,246
...that would stop this,
now is the time.

578
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:05,456
Brenda, please.

579
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:09,377
Now, come on. Please.

580
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:15,842
I'm trying.

581
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:19,220
I'm trying. It's just so hard.

582
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:22,390
You have no idea.

583
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:42,368
Can I just see the kids?

584
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:50,877
-There she is.
-Miss Martin!

585
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:54,339
Oh, my goodness.

586
00:43:54,506 --> 00:43:59,218
-Hi. Hi, Brandon.
-Did they find Cody yet?

587
00:43:59,386 --> 00:44:01,888
No, baby, they didn't.

588
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:04,307
I'm okay. I'm okay.

589
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:07,060
Hey, what are you making?
Show me.

590
00:44:07,227 --> 00:44:09,145
Show me, let me see.

591
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:12,649
Oh, my goodness.
Here, can I share your seat?

592
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:15,360
-Oh, look at that.
-So where's Felicia?

593
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:17,195
Dealing with Billy.

594
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:18,905
Oh, that's beautiful.

595
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:20,740
Did Brenda come
to work yesterday?

596
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:22,867
-Yeah.
-How'd she seem to you?

597
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:26,037
-She seemed kind of out of it. But--
-She bring Cody with her?

598
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:29,582
No. She said he was sick.

599
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:32,752
-Do you wanna see my son?
-What?

600
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,420
Here.

601
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:38,299
You know, I think it was good for him
to be the only white kid here.

602
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:42,762
You know, it's important to know
what it feels like to be the only one.

603
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:46,516
You think it's okay
I borrow Cody's picture?

604
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:49,268
-Take mine!
-You can have ours, go ahead.

605
00:44:49,436 --> 00:44:53,523
Oh, I love these pictures.
Thank you so much.

606
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:55,274
-Miss Martin?
-Yes, sweetheart?

607
00:44:55,442 --> 00:44:57,151
What happened to your hands?

608
00:44:57,319 --> 00:45:00,279
I just got some cuts in them,
but see these bandages?

609
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:02,949
It's gonna make it all better.
I'm gonna be just fine.

610
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:06,452
Thank you, sweetheart.
Oh, Cassandra.

611
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:19,132
For the latest developments
in the search for Cody Martin...

612
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:21,843
...we take you now live
to Gannon, New Jersey...

613
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:26,264
...where local detective Daniel Martin,
uncle of the missing 4-year-old...

614
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:29,809
...is about to make a public appeal
to Cody's abductor.

615
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:31,686
No questions asked.

616
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:37,650
Just drop him off on any corner
in any city. Call 911 and go.

617
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:43,156
There'll be no retribution,
no follow-up, no pursuit.

618
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:48,411
We just want the boy back. Please.
Do the right thing.

619
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:51,831
That was Detective Daniel Martin
appealing for information...

620
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:53,916
...on the whereabouts of
Cody Martin.

621
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:57,128
The 4-year-old boy went missing
when his mother's vehicle...

622
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:59,881
...was carjacked in
Gannon, New Jersey.

623
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,342
Okay.

624
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:06,012
Thank you. "Jack Russell Terrier."

625
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:08,181
Drama.

626
00:46:15,063 --> 00:46:18,107
-Come on, man, you deaf?
-What?

627
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:21,319
Candygram.

628
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:25,239
-Hey. Rafik!
-Get him!

629
00:46:25,407 --> 00:46:27,408
Get the fuck off me!

630
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:29,577
Get the fuck off!

631
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:31,496
Get off me!

632
00:46:31,663 --> 00:46:34,040
You son of a bitch!

633
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:37,960
If you can't afford me the respect,
if you can't treat me like a man...

634
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:40,755
-...if you insist on emasculating me--
-Emasculating?

635
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:42,757
-Yeah!
-You emasculate yourself!

636
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:45,218
-Is that what I do?
-You mope around my apartment.

637
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:48,471
-Ain't looking for work.
-That's what the fuck I'm talking about.

638
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:50,848
You ain't a man.
You ain't supporting your family.

639
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:53,935
-I beg your pardon.
-Nobody is allowed out, all right?

640
00:46:54,102 --> 00:46:55,812
-For what?
-He can go on out.

641
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:59,565
-But I don't know these kids.
-You don't need to know these kids.

642
00:46:59,733 --> 00:47:01,192
-Let them through.
-But we--

643
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,236
-Whose side are you on?
-You know who I am.

644
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:05,321
You know what I'm about.
Nothing's changed.

645
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:07,156
What goddamn carjacker, huh?

646
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:10,952
Put some heat under your girlfriend,
you might find out what's going on.

647
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:14,413
-Do not tell me how to do my job.
-And do not tell me how to do mine.

648
00:47:14,581 --> 00:47:16,582
-I know how to do mine.
-Let them through.

649
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:19,585
No. Not yet. Forget it.
Not yet. Come on.

650
00:47:19,753 --> 00:47:21,379
-What the fuck you want?
-Salim!

651
00:47:21,588 --> 00:47:23,798
-What the fuck is up now?
-No! No!

652
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:25,341
-Fuck.
-No!

653
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:29,262
Man, this is bullshit!

654
00:47:29,429 --> 00:47:31,264
Fuck this bitch, man.

655
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:37,103
Make a hole, make a hole,
make a hole!

656
00:47:37,437 --> 00:47:39,772
Hey, hey, hey.

657
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:42,108
-Get off me, man.
-Get in there!

658
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:45,361
You know you're wrong.
You're wrong. You're wrong.

659
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:47,405
-Yo, what's going on?
-What y'all doing?

660
00:47:47,614 --> 00:47:50,324
Y'all better bring him back.
You better bring him back.

661
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:52,618
-Bobby!
-Who are you talking to?

662
00:47:52,786 --> 00:47:55,162
-Hey, hey, hey.
-Felicia!

663
00:47:56,456 --> 00:47:58,082
Felicia!

664
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:00,626
-Felicia!
-Felicia. Felicia, don't--

665
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:03,379
-Everyone's getting unruly.
-Felicia.

666
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:08,134
Do me a favor. Watch her.

667
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:11,262
Take her to your apartment.
I'll be back for her.

668
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:27,570
-Back up!
-Damn! Come on, y'all!

669
00:48:34,661 --> 00:48:38,080
Hey, Lorraine, I just saw Cassandra.
She-- She made me a drawing.

670
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:41,500
-What are you doing with her?
-Excuse me?

671
00:48:41,668 --> 00:48:44,587
-What is she doing here?
-You don't know her?

672
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:48,090
I don't know nobody from Gannon.

673
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:53,888
And you stay away from my child.

674
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:56,349
What? What?

675
00:48:56,516 --> 00:48:59,685
Fair-weather bitch.
Come on, Brenda.

676
00:49:13,867 --> 00:49:16,118
Come on, Rafik.
Why don't you just cop to it?

677
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:18,079
-Leo.
-You can do better than that.

678
00:49:18,246 --> 00:49:20,539
-We wanna know the truth.
-Something's going on.

679
00:49:20,707 --> 00:49:22,333
-He bolted on us.
-Let's go!

680
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:24,877
-We're serious here, Rafik.
-Yo, yo, yo. Hey.

681
00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:26,712
Hey, fellas.

682
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:29,882
-You got to go through me.
-Yeah, well, we got tired of waiting.

683
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:31,509
-Waiting for what?
-For you.

684
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:33,302
You said you'd pick him up for us.

685
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:35,513
You brought him
in on that bullshit car stop?

686
00:49:35,722 --> 00:49:37,181
In this town, drugs is drugs.

687
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:40,434
-Lorenzo, they setting me up.
-Setting you up for what, brother?

688
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:47,817
Lorenzo, you know, me and Rafik,
we go way back, right?

689
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:51,445
I come up on my man with this, as
you just said, two-bit warrant today?

690
00:49:51,613 --> 00:49:54,073
And all of a sudden he
goes all-out rabbit on me.

691
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:57,827
I don't get it. Unless there's
something you're worried about.

692
00:49:57,995 --> 00:50:00,413
-Is there?
-Hey.

693
00:50:01,748 --> 00:50:02,915
Hey.

694
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:09,422
This is you?

695
00:50:11,299 --> 00:50:14,218
-This is you? Where's my nephew?
-Hey! Get him out!

696
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:17,346
-Get off!
-Get him out!

697
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:19,515
-Come on, come on.
-Come here!

698
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:21,267
Pull him off!

699
00:50:22,936 --> 00:50:24,937
-Get him out of here!
-Where's my nephew, huh?

700
00:50:25,105 --> 00:50:27,023
-Come on, get him off.
-Where is he?

701
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:28,941
-Come on!
-You mother--

702
00:50:29,776 --> 00:50:31,277
-Oh, my God, stop!
-Danny!

703
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:34,655
-Stop!
-Come here!

704
00:50:34,823 --> 00:50:37,116
-Danny!
-Come on, man, what are you doing?

705
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:39,076
-Hey, chill out.
-Hey, Rafik!

706
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:42,288
-Take it easy, man.
-Get the fuck off me!

707
00:50:42,456 --> 00:50:43,998
-You know God?
-Keep on going.

708
00:50:44,166 --> 00:50:46,917
Fuck God! There is no God!
I'm God!

709
00:50:47,085 --> 00:50:50,796
It's just you and me, motherfucker!
You hear me? It's just you and me!

710
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:53,716
What the fuck are you doing?

711
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:55,634
-What, me?
-Lorenzo, take a hike.

712
00:50:55,802 --> 00:50:59,055
I'm doing your job. You're supposed
to be king of the jungle over there?

713
00:50:59,431 --> 00:51:01,140
How'd you miss this monkey?

714
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:04,435
-I think you better leave, brother.
-Kiss my ass, brotherfucker!

715
00:51:04,936 --> 00:51:08,647
You are balling things up for
everybody, your sister included.

716
00:51:08,815 --> 00:51:13,527
And if your peoples here had any
sense, they'd tell you the same thing.

717
00:51:14,654 --> 00:51:16,489
Hey, Lorenzo.

718
00:51:16,656 --> 00:51:19,200
What are you doing here, huh?
Protecting your own?

719
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:22,119
I don't know. But maybe I ought
to ask you the same question.

720
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:25,748
Because you know and I know
there ain't no fucking jacker.

721
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:30,211
-You calling my sister a child-killer?
-I know nothing about a dead child.

722
00:51:30,378 --> 00:51:32,838
You know something about
a dead child?

723
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:36,675
I'm just saying your sister's a liar.

724
00:51:37,677 --> 00:51:40,346
What's going on in there? Lorenzo!

725
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:43,474
-Lorenzo, open up this door!
-Lorenzo!

726
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:46,519
Come on, Lorenzo, open the door!

727
00:51:46,686 --> 00:51:50,022
-You better talk to me.
-Open the door right now, Lorenzo.

728
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:52,733
-What is this?
-What the hell y'all doing to Rafik?

729
00:51:52,901 --> 00:51:55,027
What is going on?
He didn't do nothing!

730
00:51:55,195 --> 00:51:57,822
-Who let them in?
-Yo, you beat him for weed?

731
00:51:57,989 --> 00:52:00,699
-Hey, get out of my face!
-Or what, you gonna beat on us too?

732
00:52:00,867 --> 00:52:04,203
-Shut your hole and get out of here!
-Who are you to talk to us like that...

733
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:06,372
...you three-piece
Uncle Tom motherfucker?

734
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:08,207
Come on, look.
Just let me handle it.

735
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:11,168
Buzz us in. Buzz the--
Buzz us back in!

736
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:12,837
-He didn't take that kid.
-I know.

737
00:52:13,004 --> 00:52:15,840
Why'd they do that to him?
He didn't take that bitch's kid.

738
00:52:16,007 --> 00:52:18,008
-I know.
-What'd they do that for?

739
00:52:18,593 --> 00:52:20,719
-Just go home.
-What'd they do that for?

740
00:52:20,887 --> 00:52:22,888
I said, go home.
Let me handle it, okay?

741
00:52:23,056 --> 00:52:24,306
Lorenzo.

742
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:26,976
I don't know who
you think you are...

743
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:29,728
...but I think you best
be sticking with them.

744
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:14,273
-Well, it's over.
-What?

745
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:17,443
The DA wants us to hand it over
to the feds.

746
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:20,905
Look, it's a good thing, Big Daddy.
Gets you off the hook.

747
00:53:21,072 --> 00:53:23,824
No. No, no. No.

748
00:53:23,992 --> 00:53:27,286
Come on. The kid's dead.
She did it. I mean, fuck her.

749
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:30,915
Hey, slow your roll there, Bobby. We
don't know either one of those things.

750
00:53:31,082 --> 00:53:32,416
What I do know is...

751
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:35,961
...there's a whole hell of a lot
about that night that she ain't telling.

752
00:53:36,129 --> 00:53:38,797
I'm not quitting
till I get to the bottom of it.

753
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:46,222
Do me a favor, Bobby.
Go back, buy me one more day.

754
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:57,191
We organize search parties.
We work with the families.

755
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:59,026
We work with the cops.

756
00:53:59,194 --> 00:54:01,987
But most of all, we're just
a bunch of parents, you know?

757
00:54:02,155 --> 00:54:05,157
Concerned parents. Because of
that, because of who we are...

758
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:09,161
...we get in tight with the moms in
a way that's different from the police.

759
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:11,538
-You know what I'm saying.
-You were in on that...

760
00:54:11,706 --> 00:54:13,999
...Sandra Howard thing
in Bayonne, right?

761
00:54:14,167 --> 00:54:16,335
-Am I remembering that right?
-Yeah, we helped.

762
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:19,213
The mother got locked up
on that one.

763
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:20,923
Like I said, we helped.

764
00:54:24,177 --> 00:54:26,804
Well, I don't want you jumping
to conclusions about Brenda.

765
00:54:27,013 --> 00:54:29,014
No. No, that wouldn't
serve anybody.

766
00:54:29,182 --> 00:54:30,808
And I call the shots.

767
00:54:31,017 --> 00:54:33,269
Yes. It goes without saying
that we'd cooperate--

768
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:36,855
No, no, no. I call the shots.

769
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:41,318
Now, I got something
in my head...

770
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:44,947
...that would play out better coming
from somebody other than me.

771
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:47,324
I'll let your people
do whatever it is they do...

772
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:52,288
...but with all due respect, you'll be
working for me and not with me.

773
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:54,790
If that's unacceptable,
all you do is--

774
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:58,919
You tell us where you wanna go,
and we will help you get there.

775
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:03,299
Yeah, all right. Okay, then.

776
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:05,050
We just want the boy back.

777
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:09,847
Have you or any of your people
ever been out to Freedomland?

778
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:13,726
You guys still hazing
your rookies there?

779
00:55:14,644 --> 00:55:16,061
Yeah.

780
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:24,862
Detective Council here brought us up
to speed from the police point of view.

781
00:55:25,071 --> 00:55:27,698
But we are not here as cops.
We're here as parents.

782
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:30,034
We're here because
we all have children too.

783
00:55:30,201 --> 00:55:31,493
What happened to your son...

784
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:34,246
...could have happened
to any of our own children, okay?

785
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:36,248
Okay.

786
00:55:36,583 --> 00:55:39,084
Now, this is Marie. And Lewis.

787
00:55:39,627 --> 00:55:42,504
This is Elaine. This is Tina.

788
00:55:42,672 --> 00:55:44,256
Elaine is her mom.

789
00:55:44,424 --> 00:55:46,008
Who's Kent?

790
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:49,803
He's the first boy we ever
tried to find. Ten years ago.

791
00:55:49,971 --> 00:55:52,097
We've been helping find kids
ever since.

792
00:55:52,265 --> 00:55:54,933
-Did you find Kent?
-Brenda?

793
00:55:55,101 --> 00:55:57,353
Would you like our help?

794
00:55:59,397 --> 00:56:00,647
Okay.

795
00:56:00,815 --> 00:56:03,108
Good. Good.

796
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:08,113
Okay, now, first off, what I need
is to hear from you what happened.

797
00:56:08,281 --> 00:56:10,949
I can't. I can't say that.
I told the police everything.

798
00:56:11,117 --> 00:56:13,202
-I told them--
-I know, I know, I know, I know.

799
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:16,955
It's just-- Look, like I said, they
have their priorities and we have ours.

800
00:56:17,123 --> 00:56:19,833
One more time, Brenda, and
I wouldn't put you through this--

801
00:56:20,001 --> 00:56:23,128
No. No. I can't. I just....

802
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:27,049
No.

803
00:56:30,136 --> 00:56:31,720
Okay.

804
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:36,517
Okay. I understand.

805
00:56:36,684 --> 00:56:39,311
We'll just go with the police report
if you want.

806
00:56:40,271 --> 00:56:43,982
Okay. Now first thing,
we come to the question head-on.

807
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:48,028
Where is your son?

808
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:52,825
Right? Where do we look?

809
00:56:52,992 --> 00:56:55,661
Where do we look?
What is your gut feeling, Brenda?

810
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:58,497
-He took off in a car.
-Okay, well, let's say your son...

811
00:56:58,665 --> 00:57:01,959
...woke up. Let's say the guy
realized he had a kid in the car...

812
00:57:02,168 --> 00:57:05,170
...sooner rather than later.
So let's keep it within a mile.

813
00:57:05,338 --> 00:57:08,173
But the fact of the matter is,
it's been almost 24 hours.

814
00:57:08,341 --> 00:57:10,509
So the odds of him still
wandering the streets...

815
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:13,387
...not getting picked up by now
are not so good.

816
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:16,515
Now, we looked at the map
earlier today, and we came up...

817
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:19,768
...with four possibilities where a kid
could conceivably get lost...

818
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:23,021
...or hide out for a whole day
or night and not get noticed.

819
00:57:23,189 --> 00:57:25,691
And then we drove around,
we eliminated three of them.

820
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:29,570
This is a golf course.
This is a cemetery.

821
00:57:29,737 --> 00:57:31,447
This is a ball field.

822
00:57:31,614 --> 00:57:34,533
There's no cover, no place
to hide, if that's what he's doing.

823
00:57:34,701 --> 00:57:37,369
Which leaves us...

824
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:39,288
...Freedomland.

825
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:41,665
Freedomland?

826
00:57:41,833 --> 00:57:44,710
It's an old state children's home
in the back of Cotter's Woods.

827
00:57:44,878 --> 00:57:47,838
It was like a foundling asylum,
like some kind of a youth house.

828
00:57:48,006 --> 00:57:50,632
-It's been shut since the '50s.
-It's not far from Armstrong.

829
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:54,386
-Cody could have--
-Yeah, okay. Okay.

830
00:57:58,933 --> 00:58:00,684
So Freedomland?

831
00:58:00,852 --> 00:58:03,061
I feel good about Freedomland
for this one.

832
00:58:03,229 --> 00:58:05,147
-Okay.
-Okay.

833
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:07,065
Freedomland it is.

834
00:58:07,233 --> 00:58:10,277
-You're coming too, right?
-Absolutely.

835
00:58:57,492 --> 00:58:58,951
What the hell's all this?

836
00:58:59,118 --> 00:59:01,578
-I just need to get her to Freedomland.
-And you will.

837
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:04,331
It's not gonna work if you
make a beeline for it. Trust me.

838
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:06,792
Meanwhile, we have a little problem.

839
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:11,797
Look, you're here,
you might as well get out.

840
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:13,966
Just let us open the door.
How about that?

841
00:59:14,133 --> 00:59:15,801
Excuse me, ladies.

842
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:22,683
Hey, Brenda. How you doing?

843
00:59:41,744 --> 00:59:46,582
Heavenly father, we ask for your
blessing and guiding hand today...

844
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:50,085
...as we send
these volunteers down...

845
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:54,464
...to help the mother of Cody Martin
find her child...

846
00:59:54,632 --> 00:59:56,842
...and safely bring him home.

847
00:59:57,010 --> 00:59:59,511
And we ask for the courage
and fortitude...

848
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:03,265
...to see this task successfully done.

849
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:06,101
In the name of the Father,
and of the Son...

850
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:08,854
...and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

851
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:10,856
Amen.

852
01:01:38,111 --> 01:01:39,653
Cody!

853
01:01:39,821 --> 01:01:51,915
-Cody!
-Cody!

854
01:01:52,083 --> 01:01:54,751
So where's her bug bands?

855
01:01:54,961 --> 01:01:56,461
Karen doesn't wear bug bands.

856
01:01:56,629 --> 01:02:00,006
Jesus. Anything bit Karen,
it'd lose its mind.

857
01:02:00,174 --> 01:02:01,842
Really? Why?

858
01:02:02,009 --> 01:02:04,970
Because Karen's son was abducted.

859
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:07,222
Our first kid.

860
01:02:07,765 --> 01:02:09,307
You mean, Kent?

861
01:02:09,851 --> 01:02:11,810
Ten years ago.

862
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:15,981
Tina here was a baby.

863
01:02:16,649 --> 01:02:19,443
We all knew each other
from the neighborhood.

864
01:02:19,610 --> 01:02:21,653
-Karen got us together.
-Cody Martin!

865
01:02:21,821 --> 01:02:24,614
We had no idea what the hell
we were doing...

866
01:02:24,782 --> 01:02:28,744
...but we wound up combing
every goddamn forest...

867
01:02:28,911 --> 01:02:34,624
...field, drainpipe, creek, culvert....
Oh, everywhere.

868
01:02:35,668 --> 01:02:39,588
And you know, we....
We still post flyers.

869
01:02:40,798 --> 01:02:43,383
Well, what can I say? We....

870
01:02:43,551 --> 01:02:46,344
We got better at it with practice.

871
01:02:47,513 --> 01:02:50,682
Karen knows who took him too.
The cops just can't prove it.

872
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:52,434
-We can't prove it.
-Yeah.

873
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:54,019
God.

874
01:02:54,187 --> 01:02:56,813
Me and Kent went to school together.
So like...

875
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:59,191
...I know he's my own age and all.

876
01:02:59,358 --> 01:03:02,152
When we find him, I'm still
expecting him to be 8 years old...

877
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:03,779
...like the last time I saw him.

878
01:03:04,822 --> 01:03:06,364
Cody!

879
01:03:08,242 --> 01:03:10,118
-Cody!
-Come on, Cody!

880
01:03:12,246 --> 01:03:13,997
So why you all triple-teaming me...

881
01:03:14,165 --> 01:03:16,708
...while Karen's got Brenda
by herself all up in her ear?

882
01:03:16,876 --> 01:03:18,084
Why?

883
01:03:18,252 --> 01:03:20,754
-Sympathy.
-Sympathy.

884
01:03:20,922 --> 01:03:24,716
I never lost a child, Lorenzo.
Did you?

885
01:03:36,896 --> 01:03:39,189
-Cody!
-Cody Martin!

886
01:03:40,566 --> 01:03:42,734
Hey, Cody!

887
01:03:43,402 --> 01:03:45,320
Cody Martin!

888
01:03:47,073 --> 01:03:49,074
-Cody Martin!
-Cody!

889
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:22,375
Watch that.

890
01:05:26,797 --> 01:05:28,965
Stay together.

891
01:05:39,685 --> 01:05:41,686
Watch your step. I've got you.

892
01:05:43,356 --> 01:05:44,856
-All right.
-Keep moving.

893
01:05:45,024 --> 01:05:46,858
I'm so tired.

894
01:05:47,026 --> 01:05:48,777
What do you want from me?

895
01:06:12,051 --> 01:06:14,219
We're gonna have a look around.

896
01:06:14,387 --> 01:06:17,681
It's a little dangerous. Half of these
floorboards can go at any minute.

897
01:06:17,848 --> 01:06:21,059
So I want you to stay in here
and wait for us, okay?

898
01:06:21,602 --> 01:06:23,103
What are you doing?

899
01:06:23,270 --> 01:06:25,230
Just wait for us.

900
01:06:32,363 --> 01:06:34,572
I can't be alone.

901
01:06:50,756 --> 01:06:53,091
I swear to God,
I feel like they're still here.

902
01:06:56,137 --> 01:06:57,762
I tell you, when....

903
01:06:57,930 --> 01:07:00,432
When they finally padlocked
this place, it was....

904
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:03,768
It was like shutting down hell.

905
01:07:05,521 --> 01:07:10,275
Do you have any idea
of the generations of children...

906
01:07:10,443 --> 01:07:12,694
...who suffered in here?

907
01:07:13,362 --> 01:07:15,113
Thousands.

908
01:07:16,323 --> 01:07:20,160
Thousands who were neglected...

909
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:23,621
...and abused...

910
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:26,082
...forgotten.

911
01:07:27,168 --> 01:07:29,210
Just....

912
01:07:29,378 --> 01:07:31,629
Just wasted.

913
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:31,523
Even your own family turns on you
after a while.

914
01:08:31,690 --> 01:08:33,691
You come downstairs,
the other kids are like:

915
01:08:33,859 --> 01:08:36,569
"Mommy, are you gonna
be sad today?"

916
01:08:37,696 --> 01:08:40,156
That's the only thing that can
bring you back to some...

917
01:08:40,366 --> 01:08:42,408
...charade of normal life,
when it hits you...

918
01:08:42,576 --> 01:08:46,538
...what you're doing to your
other kids, to your marriage.

919
01:08:47,206 --> 01:08:51,042
But with me, I couldn't even
rally for that. I couldn't fake it.

920
01:08:51,877 --> 01:08:55,672
This bastard, Jimmy,
he took away my life.

921
01:08:55,881 --> 01:08:58,133
He took away my family.

922
01:09:00,136 --> 01:09:02,303
My husband's like, you know,
"Come on, Karen...

923
01:09:02,471 --> 01:09:05,390
...you gotta think about
the other kids. Think about me.

924
01:09:05,558 --> 01:09:08,560
We gotta get on with
the business of living."

925
01:09:09,562 --> 01:09:12,397
That's what he called it,
"The business of living."

926
01:09:15,651 --> 01:09:19,070
See, men, they always cave in.

927
01:09:19,738 --> 01:09:21,614
Talk to you about
the business of living...

928
01:09:21,782 --> 01:09:23,741
...tell you to,
"Think about the others.

929
01:09:23,909 --> 01:09:26,119
The rest of us." Them.

930
01:09:28,998 --> 01:09:30,790
And then they leave.

931
01:09:30,958 --> 01:09:33,334
Because they just don't
have the belly for it.

932
01:09:33,502 --> 01:09:35,670
They just don't have the heart.

933
01:09:37,756 --> 01:09:39,424
We....

934
01:09:41,218 --> 01:09:43,928
We are the hunters, Brenda.

935
01:09:48,017 --> 01:09:51,227
What can I say to my other kids?
They're with my husband now.

936
01:09:51,937 --> 01:09:53,438
All I can tell them is the truth:

937
01:09:53,606 --> 01:09:55,982
If it had happened to them
instead of their brother...

938
01:09:56,150 --> 01:09:58,151
...I would be the same way for them.

939
01:09:59,737 --> 01:10:01,988
I want them back, my family.

940
01:10:02,156 --> 01:10:06,034
But until someone can tell me
that my son is gone...

941
01:10:07,077 --> 01:10:08,786
...here I am.

942
01:10:09,538 --> 01:10:11,748
And here I'll stay.

943
01:10:16,337 --> 01:10:19,547
Sometimes I just wanna grab...

944
01:10:20,466 --> 01:10:23,760
...that murderous, perverted
son of a bitch and say to him:

945
01:10:23,969 --> 01:10:27,263
"Look, Jimmy, you took him.
I know it and you know it.

946
01:10:27,473 --> 01:10:29,307
Now, don't say a word,
just nod your head.

947
01:10:29,475 --> 01:10:32,143
Is he dead? Yes or no?

948
01:10:32,311 --> 01:10:34,562
Do that for me,
I will never bother you again.

949
01:10:34,730 --> 01:10:36,731
No one's gonna nail you
for nodding your head.

950
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:39,817
I swear I will go away.
You will never see me again.

951
01:10:39,985 --> 01:10:41,653
Is he dead?

952
01:10:41,820 --> 01:10:43,821
Just nod your head.

953
01:10:46,325 --> 01:10:48,952
I need to know.
I need to know now, Jimmy.

954
01:10:49,119 --> 01:10:50,828
Is he dead?

955
01:10:52,331 --> 01:10:55,458
Sweet Christ in heaven...

956
01:10:55,626 --> 01:10:57,877
...won't you please just tell me?

957
01:10:58,045 --> 01:11:00,171
Just nod your head."

958
01:11:04,718 --> 01:11:07,553
A nod of the head,
such a little thing.

959
01:11:07,846 --> 01:11:10,723
And night becomes day.

960
01:11:12,142 --> 01:11:15,520
Is he dead? Yes or no?
That's all I ask.

961
01:11:15,688 --> 01:11:17,438
Yes or no?

962
01:11:19,733 --> 01:11:21,859
Put my heart at rest.

963
01:11:22,528 --> 01:11:25,530
Put my heart at rest, Brenda.

964
01:11:32,663 --> 01:11:35,290
It's so hot.

965
01:11:37,084 --> 01:11:39,877
I feel like I'm in hell.

966
01:11:50,389 --> 01:11:52,015
When I said I just wanted to know...

967
01:11:52,182 --> 01:11:54,767
...if my son was dead or alive,
that's not completely true.

968
01:11:54,935 --> 01:11:58,396
I would like to give him
a proper burial in sanctified ground.

969
01:11:58,564 --> 01:12:00,398
The thought of him
lying in some ditch...

970
01:12:00,566 --> 01:12:05,069
...in some shallow grave in the forest
where the animals can--

971
01:12:18,083 --> 01:12:20,251
Shit.

972
01:12:32,097 --> 01:12:34,724
My boy wasn't like
those children in there.

973
01:12:35,476 --> 01:12:38,186
-Okay.
-He was loved.

974
01:12:41,732 --> 01:12:43,483
He was cherished.

975
01:12:43,650 --> 01:12:44,942
Okay.

976
01:12:45,110 --> 01:12:46,944
He's not here.

977
01:12:50,407 --> 01:12:52,241
You're in the wrong park.

978
01:12:54,536 --> 01:12:56,204
Thank you, God.

979
01:13:01,835 --> 01:13:03,127
Thank you.

980
01:13:20,896 --> 01:13:22,897
Is he dead?

981
01:13:25,734 --> 01:13:27,318
-What?
-Yes.

982
01:13:27,486 --> 01:13:29,987
-How?
-He drank a bottle of cough syrup.

983
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:32,115
-When was this?
-Two nights ago.

984
01:13:32,282 --> 01:13:34,951
-The night you came to the hospital?
-The night before that.

985
01:13:38,038 --> 01:13:40,957
-Did you see him drink the syrup?
-No, I wasn't there.

986
01:13:41,708 --> 01:13:43,668
Was anybody else--?

987
01:13:45,504 --> 01:13:47,004
He was all alone.

988
01:13:50,509 --> 01:13:52,760
He was-- He was all....

989
01:13:53,804 --> 01:13:55,430
All alone.

990
01:13:59,017 --> 01:14:00,685
Where is he, Brenda?

991
01:14:02,020 --> 01:14:04,021
He's not here.

992
01:14:04,189 --> 01:14:06,023
Brenda.

993
01:14:06,483 --> 01:14:08,359
Where is he?

994
01:14:12,823 --> 01:14:15,241
Oh, God, please.

995
01:14:22,875 --> 01:14:24,041
Oh, God. Please.

996
01:14:24,209 --> 01:14:27,712
-God, I can't find him.
-Just try to stay calm.

997
01:14:28,797 --> 01:14:44,896
I can't find him.

998
01:14:52,446 --> 01:14:54,238
Come here.

999
01:14:54,406 --> 01:14:55,740
I think we've got something.

1000
01:14:56,074 --> 01:14:58,242
Copy that. We're on our way.

1001
01:14:58,410 --> 01:15:01,245
This is subsoil.
It should be about two feet under.

1002
01:15:01,413 --> 01:15:04,332
And this formation here,
this is man-made.

1003
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:07,210
-Is this it? Is this where he is?
-Yes.

1004
01:15:07,377 --> 01:15:09,587
-This is where you buried him?
-Yes.

1005
01:15:11,924 --> 01:15:16,761
-You dug this up?
-Yes.

1006
01:15:19,264 --> 01:15:20,932
-And then what'd you do?
-What?

1007
01:15:21,099 --> 01:15:23,559
-You pile all these rocks on here?
-Yes.

1008
01:15:23,769 --> 01:15:25,603
-All these stones.
-Yes.

1009
01:15:26,104 --> 01:15:27,855
Over here.

1010
01:15:28,815 --> 01:15:30,316
What are they doing?

1011
01:15:32,277 --> 01:15:34,862
-I can't be here. I--
-Hey. Hey. I don't wanna be here...

1012
01:15:35,030 --> 01:15:36,989
-...any more than you.
-I'll tell you.

1013
01:15:37,157 --> 01:15:39,617
I don't want a lawyer.
Just please-- Just take me away.

1014
01:15:39,952 --> 01:15:41,327
Everything.

1015
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:43,829
Yeah, I swear, but...

1016
01:15:44,706 --> 01:15:45,915
...just to you.

1017
01:15:50,295 --> 01:15:51,712
All right, come here.

1018
01:15:53,590 --> 01:15:56,300
We're gonna go, but I need you
to do one thing for me, okay?

1019
01:15:56,468 --> 01:15:59,220
-What?
-Show me how you carried the stones.

1020
01:16:00,013 --> 01:16:02,390
I need you to pick me up...

1021
01:16:02,558 --> 01:16:03,933
...that one right there.

1022
01:16:27,666 --> 01:16:30,543
Here. Just take it from me.

1023
01:16:31,044 --> 01:16:34,171
Come on. Take it.

1024
01:16:35,090 --> 01:16:36,841
Take it.

1025
01:16:42,681 --> 01:16:46,350
You know, Brenda,
when you tell me everything...

1026
01:16:47,519 --> 01:16:51,522
...I want you to start by telling me
who dug that grave.

1027
01:16:51,690 --> 01:16:53,566
And who carried those stones.

1028
01:16:53,734 --> 01:16:58,321
And please, please,
do not tell me it was you.

1029
01:16:58,488 --> 01:17:00,865
Because if you start with a lie...

1030
01:17:01,033 --> 01:17:04,201
...you will have lost the greatest ally
you've ever had in your life...

1031
01:17:04,369 --> 01:17:07,038
...and I won't even bother
to take your statement.

1032
01:17:07,873 --> 01:17:10,458
I will charge you and dump your ass
in the system.

1033
01:17:10,626 --> 01:17:12,501
You hear what I'm saying?
You hear me?

1034
01:17:13,003 --> 01:17:15,463
Please, just-- I swear to God,
I'll tell you everything.

1035
01:17:15,631 --> 01:17:17,214
Just take me away, please.

1036
01:17:21,803 --> 01:17:24,388
-Page me when he's up.
-Right.

1037
01:17:25,140 --> 01:17:27,600
-Go.
-Y'all know who this is?

1038
01:17:28,727 --> 01:17:30,394
This is me.

1039
01:17:30,562 --> 01:17:33,230
This is you, and you, and you.

1040
01:17:33,398 --> 01:17:36,567
This is all of us and none of us.

1041
01:17:36,902 --> 01:17:39,695
This is the nigger in the woodpile.

1042
01:17:40,405 --> 01:17:44,909
This is, "A black man did it."
The hottest item in the store.

1043
01:17:45,077 --> 01:17:46,410
-But you know what?
-What?

1044
01:17:46,578 --> 01:17:47,787
We ain't buying it.

1045
01:17:47,954 --> 01:17:49,413
-You know what?
-What?

1046
01:17:49,581 --> 01:17:51,040
We ain't having it.

1047
01:17:51,667 --> 01:17:53,000
Gannon, heads up.

1048
01:17:53,168 --> 01:17:55,086
Hey, Dempsy, heads up.

1049
01:17:55,253 --> 01:17:59,256
Here's the point that you been missing
Armstrong ain't no locked-down prison

1050
01:17:59,424 --> 01:18:02,093
Hey, Gannon, heads up
Hey, Dempsy, heads up

1051
01:18:02,260 --> 01:18:03,719
Here's the point that you....

1052
01:18:03,929 --> 01:18:05,262
Hey.

1053
01:18:05,639 --> 01:18:08,849
-You charge her yet?
-I'm waiting on the body.

1054
01:18:09,017 --> 01:18:10,267
She kill him?

1055
01:18:10,435 --> 01:18:12,520
-I don't know.
-You gotta go with homicide.

1056
01:18:12,688 --> 01:18:14,230
-Okay.
-Otherwise, Armstrong--

1057
01:18:14,439 --> 01:18:16,482
-They'll raise the fucking roof tonight.
-Hey.

1058
01:18:16,650 --> 01:18:18,442
I tried to get you
to stop the blockade.

1059
01:18:18,610 --> 01:18:20,403
-Circumstances dictated--
-Circumstances?

1060
01:18:20,570 --> 01:18:22,154
You wanna talk circumstances?

1061
01:18:22,823 --> 01:18:24,949
The circumstances were,
it was Armstrong.

1062
01:18:25,117 --> 01:18:28,536
The circumstances were, they were
mud-flat animals on welfare...

1063
01:18:28,704 --> 01:18:31,580
...that didn't deserve the consideration
or respect you give a dog.

1064
01:18:31,748 --> 01:18:35,334
Look, Lorenzo, the prosecutor...

1065
01:18:35,502 --> 01:18:38,421
...if he has a press conference
tonight to announce the arrest...

1066
01:18:38,588 --> 01:18:39,797
...he wants you by his side.

1067
01:18:39,965 --> 01:18:42,800
-Talk to people about keeping cool.
-Oh, he does, does he?

1068
01:18:42,968 --> 01:18:45,970
Well, you tell that prosecutor
he can kiss my black ass.

1069
01:18:46,471 --> 01:18:48,973
And when he's done,
you can get some too.

1070
01:18:59,317 --> 01:19:01,569
-Where is she?
-Interview room.

1071
01:19:01,737 --> 01:19:03,654
Does she at least have
a fucking lawyer?

1072
01:19:03,822 --> 01:19:05,656
Danny, wait. You can't--

1073
01:19:09,828 --> 01:19:13,080
So, Brenda,
let's talk about those stones.

1074
01:19:14,583 --> 01:19:17,918
He didn't wanna have anything
to do with it, but he did it for me.

1075
01:19:18,086 --> 01:19:22,006
-Who? Who did?
-I dug that grave with my hands.

1076
01:19:22,299 --> 01:19:24,383
I did. I told myself...

1077
01:19:24,551 --> 01:19:27,970
...I was making his bed one last time,
and that's how I got through it.

1078
01:19:28,138 --> 01:19:30,514
There was no way I could
bring my boy to that place...

1079
01:19:30,682 --> 01:19:32,475
...so I begged him to do it for me.

1080
01:19:32,642 --> 01:19:35,352
He had to do it, Billy.
I had no one else to turn to.

1081
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:37,188
Billy? Billy who?

1082
01:19:37,355 --> 01:19:40,441
I told him he was responsible
for what had happened too...

1083
01:19:40,609 --> 01:19:43,235
...but it was all me.
It was always me.

1084
01:19:43,403 --> 01:19:46,697
But he had to do it.
I had no one else to turn to.

1085
01:19:46,865 --> 01:19:48,908
Billy who?

1086
01:19:49,201 --> 01:19:50,701
Felicia's Billy.

1087
01:20:02,714 --> 01:20:06,425
I have spent all my life trying to
get distance from other people.

1088
01:20:06,593 --> 01:20:10,554
-My family, men, other kids--
-Hey, hey, hey, Brenda. Brenda.

1089
01:20:11,056 --> 01:20:13,557
Let's stick to what happened
three nights ago, all right?

1090
01:20:13,725 --> 01:20:16,852
No, no, you have to let me.
Ever since I met you...

1091
01:20:17,062 --> 01:20:20,105
...I've been trying to think of a way
to really, really tell you this.

1092
01:20:20,273 --> 01:20:22,149
And now you just have to let me.

1093
01:20:25,487 --> 01:20:29,448
With my family, my brothers, it was
like, "Everybody just leave me be."

1094
01:20:29,616 --> 01:20:32,576
But with a child, when you
have a child, it's yours, it's safe.

1095
01:20:32,744 --> 01:20:34,954
It's finally safe. And....

1096
01:20:35,121 --> 01:20:37,081
And when I got pregnant,
it was an accident.

1097
01:20:37,249 --> 01:20:39,792
I mean, it never occurred to me
to have a baby.

1098
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:43,087
I was my own baby.
But then I had this vision...

1099
01:20:43,255 --> 01:20:45,005
...of what it could be like.

1100
01:20:45,423 --> 01:20:49,176
The companionship,
the secret...

1101
01:20:49,344 --> 01:20:51,095
...companionship.

1102
01:20:51,263 --> 01:20:53,013
I never told the guy
who knocked me up.

1103
01:20:53,181 --> 01:20:56,141
And for four years with Cody,
it's like life is this cliff...

1104
01:20:56,309 --> 01:20:58,853
...but we carved out a ledge
together, you know? But....

1105
01:21:00,438 --> 01:21:02,773
But it wasn't enough,
just being with my son.

1106
01:21:02,941 --> 01:21:05,693
You can't....
You can't live like that.

1107
01:21:06,444 --> 01:21:08,612
Did Billy have anything to do
with what happened?

1108
01:21:08,780 --> 01:21:10,739
No, he barely even met Cody.

1109
01:21:11,533 --> 01:21:13,742
So Billy--

1110
01:21:13,910 --> 01:21:16,996
I had this thing that I did
at the Rainbow Club. I--

1111
01:21:17,163 --> 01:21:19,874
I brought in professionals,
teachers, lawyers, cops...

1112
01:21:20,041 --> 01:21:22,459
...to talk to the kids,
to show them another way to be.

1113
01:21:22,627 --> 01:21:25,629
So Billy comes in. I knew he was
unemployed and it was so sad...

1114
01:21:25,797 --> 01:21:28,841
...but he talked to the kids
so earnestly...

1115
01:21:29,009 --> 01:21:31,844
...about stocks and bonds
and investments...

1116
01:21:32,012 --> 01:21:34,471
...and it was way over their head,
but it was so....

1117
01:21:34,639 --> 01:21:38,309
So sweet, you know. And I looked over
at Felicia while he was talking...

1118
01:21:38,476 --> 01:21:41,145
...and she rolls her eyes
like she's had it with this loser.

1119
01:21:41,313 --> 01:21:46,066
But I understood him so well,
so fast, because it's like-- Like...

1120
01:21:46,234 --> 01:21:47,484
...he was me.

1121
01:21:48,737 --> 01:21:51,322
And so after the talk,
I went over and I took his hand...

1122
01:21:51,489 --> 01:21:54,825
...and, yeah, he must have jumped
a mile, but it was on, you know.

1123
01:21:54,993 --> 01:21:58,412
The whole thing took, like,
10 seconds and it was on.

1124
01:22:00,832 --> 01:22:03,459
After he came over
to my apartment that night...

1125
01:22:03,668 --> 01:22:05,502
...I knew I was in trouble...

1126
01:22:05,670 --> 01:22:08,797
...because I had finally lain down
with someone who was not a child...

1127
01:22:08,965 --> 01:22:10,591
...after all these years. I had...

1128
01:22:11,343 --> 01:22:15,095
...over-abstained, you see,
and I was in deep trouble.

1129
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:26,523
Before Billy, I used to love
to lie down with Cody...

1130
01:22:26,691 --> 01:22:29,610
...or just watch movies with him
before he went to bed.

1131
01:22:29,778 --> 01:22:32,696
And now, it's like
I look at my son's face...

1132
01:22:32,864 --> 01:22:35,866
...in the TV light,
and it's like he's....

1133
01:22:36,034 --> 01:22:38,702
He's un-precious to me.
And it's, like, videos, you know?

1134
01:22:38,870 --> 01:22:41,872
I'm wasting critical minutes.
You know, Billy's downstairs.

1135
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:44,541
I gotta get this kid down.
And, you know, Cody takes--

1136
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:50,381
Cody....

1137
01:22:51,633 --> 01:22:53,342
Cody took...

1138
01:22:54,719 --> 01:22:57,388
...an hour,
sometimes 30 minutes.

1139
01:22:58,223 --> 01:23:03,560
And I-- I know he can feel my tension,
and it's keeping him awake.

1140
01:23:03,728 --> 01:23:05,437
Sometimes I would think
he was asleep...

1141
01:23:05,605 --> 01:23:08,524
...and I'd be halfway down the hall,
like tippy-toe, tippy-toe...

1142
01:23:08,733 --> 01:23:11,652
...and I'd hear, "Mommy. Mommy."
And I'd be like:

1143
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:14,279
"Get to sleep!"
And how fast would you fall asleep...

1144
01:23:14,447 --> 01:23:16,991
...if you have this half-insane giant
hanging over you...

1145
01:23:17,158 --> 01:23:19,159
...who doesn't love you
or want you anymore?

1146
01:23:19,327 --> 01:23:21,787
Who used to treat you like
the sun, moon and stars...

1147
01:23:21,955 --> 01:23:24,665
...but no more, no more.

1148
01:23:30,755 --> 01:23:33,007
So I started giving him...

1149
01:23:33,174 --> 01:23:34,758
...cough syrup...

1150
01:23:34,926 --> 01:23:36,969
...to put him to sleep.
You know, not much.

1151
01:23:37,137 --> 01:23:40,431
Just whatever you give a kid
for a stuffed head.

1152
01:23:40,598 --> 01:23:42,266
And it worked.

1153
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:46,020
It worked. And I told him it was
night vitamins.

1154
01:23:46,187 --> 01:23:48,605
And it became part
of our bedtime routine.

1155
01:23:48,773 --> 01:23:50,774
Look, Brenda,
I hear what you're saying...

1156
01:23:50,942 --> 01:23:53,569
...but we gotta get back to what
happened three nights ago.

1157
01:23:53,778 --> 01:23:57,197
-I need you to start telling me--
-He wouldn't go down, Cody.

1158
01:23:57,365 --> 01:24:00,117
You know, I had already dosed him
and he wouldn't go down.

1159
01:24:00,285 --> 01:24:03,328
And that night, you know,
I had to talk to Billy because...

1160
01:24:03,496 --> 01:24:07,583
...I knew that he was breaking it off
and going back to Felicia.

1161
01:24:07,792 --> 01:24:10,044
And the thing of it is,
I was kind of relieved...

1162
01:24:10,211 --> 01:24:13,505
...that Billy was dumping me
and putting me out of my misery...

1163
01:24:13,673 --> 01:24:16,383
...and it was probably the last night
I'd leave my son alone.

1164
01:24:16,551 --> 01:24:18,052
It was probably....

1165
01:24:18,470 --> 01:24:20,804
Probably the last,
but he wouldn't go down.

1166
01:24:21,306 --> 01:24:23,807
So I said to him:

1167
01:24:23,975 --> 01:24:26,602
"You be a good boy
and go to sleep."

1168
01:24:26,811 --> 01:24:28,437
And he was--
You know, he was furious.

1169
01:24:28,605 --> 01:24:31,815
He said, "I don't want you to go."
But like a man would say it, you know:

1170
01:24:31,983 --> 01:24:34,276
-"I don't want you to go."
-"I don't want you to go."

1171
01:24:34,444 --> 01:24:37,029
You know, standing there all punchy
with the cough syrup...

1172
01:24:37,197 --> 01:24:40,324
...and, you know, I wanna say to him,
"Tonight is the last night.

1173
01:24:40,492 --> 01:24:43,160
Just give me this one last"....

1174
01:24:44,329 --> 01:24:46,330
But I said, you know:

1175
01:24:46,956 --> 01:24:50,417
"You go to sleep.
I'll be back soon. I promise."

1176
01:24:50,585 --> 01:24:52,669
And he says, you know--

1177
01:24:52,837 --> 01:24:56,131
He says to me,
"If you go, you'll be sorry."

1178
01:24:56,341 --> 01:25:02,346
But like a jealous husband, you know.
"If you go, you'll be sorry."

1179
01:25:02,931 --> 01:25:05,599
And I almost, you know--
I almost didn't go.

1180
01:25:05,767 --> 01:25:08,185
You know, I'd never--
I never heard that tone from him.

1181
01:25:08,353 --> 01:25:11,188
If he'd only sounded like,
you know, more....

1182
01:25:11,356 --> 01:25:13,816
More babyish or more pathetic.

1183
01:25:13,983 --> 01:25:16,110
But, you know, it was so hard,
his voice...

1184
01:25:16,277 --> 01:25:19,113
...and it scared me. It, like,
drove me out of the house...

1185
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:22,866
...and, you know, he was--
He was only 4 years old.

1186
01:25:23,034 --> 01:25:26,078
You know,
nobody has to tell me that.

1187
01:25:32,168 --> 01:25:34,211
So...

1188
01:25:36,214 --> 01:25:38,215
...I go downstairs...

1189
01:25:38,383 --> 01:25:40,175
...and sure enough...

1190
01:25:40,510 --> 01:25:44,304
...Billy says it's over.
And I'm yelling and I'm crying...

1191
01:25:44,472 --> 01:25:47,516
...but really I'm just going
through the motions because....

1192
01:25:47,684 --> 01:25:51,395
Because really, I'm kind of relieved.
And I go back upstairs and I--

1193
01:25:51,563 --> 01:25:55,149
I don't see him, Cody,
and I look for him in his bed.

1194
01:25:55,316 --> 01:25:56,900
And I'm-- I--

1195
01:25:57,068 --> 01:26:00,487
I'm like, you know, "Oh, he's hiding,"
you know, "He's....

1196
01:26:00,655 --> 01:26:02,698
He's hiding. He's mad at me.

1197
01:26:02,907 --> 01:26:05,117
He's trying to scare me
or punish me or something.

1198
01:26:05,285 --> 01:26:07,244
But that's okay,
because I deserve it."

1199
01:26:07,412 --> 01:26:10,539
And I'm kind of lighthearted now,
you know...

1200
01:26:10,707 --> 01:26:13,417
...because it's all over and done with,
so I'm like, "Cody?

1201
01:26:13,585 --> 01:26:16,253
Cody?" Like, "Where are you?"

1202
01:26:16,421 --> 01:26:20,716
And then I see him, you know,
he's under the table. And he's asleep.

1203
01:26:20,925 --> 01:26:26,597
And I-- And I crawl over there because
I'm gonna carry him back to bed.

1204
01:26:26,764 --> 01:26:30,434
And I put my hand
in something wet...

1205
01:26:30,602 --> 01:26:33,770
...and there's the smell....

1206
01:26:35,732 --> 01:26:37,482
The smell....

1207
01:26:38,526 --> 01:26:42,446
And that's when I saw
the empty bottle.

1208
01:26:44,449 --> 01:26:48,619
And I remembered,
"If you go, you'll be sorry.

1209
01:26:48,786 --> 01:26:52,873
If you go, you'll be sorry."

1210
01:26:55,168 --> 01:26:56,543
Well, was he still alive?

1211
01:26:58,171 --> 01:27:00,797
-How do you know?
-He was not alive.

1212
01:27:01,299 --> 01:27:04,718
-Did you try to revive him?
-He was not alive.

1213
01:27:04,886 --> 01:27:06,553
Tell me how you knew
he was not alive.

1214
01:27:06,721 --> 01:27:08,639
Because I'm his mom.

1215
01:27:08,806 --> 01:27:12,309
And us moms know these things.

1216
01:27:14,145 --> 01:27:18,649
He said, "If you go, you'll be sorry."
And he was right.

1217
01:27:18,816 --> 01:27:20,067
-He was right.
-Brenda.

1218
01:27:20,235 --> 01:27:22,653
-He didn't know what he was doing.
-He was right.

1219
01:27:22,820 --> 01:27:24,446
-He was right.
-Brenda, listen to me.

1220
01:27:24,614 --> 01:27:28,075
It was an accident. If what you
described is true, it was an accident.

1221
01:27:28,243 --> 01:27:30,452
-Don't you play me.
-What happened next?

1222
01:27:30,620 --> 01:27:32,204
No.

1223
01:27:32,372 --> 01:27:35,749
-Brenda, we gotta keep talking.
-No, I'm done. Just charge me.

1224
01:27:45,051 --> 01:27:47,261
Tell me, Brenda,
you wanna see Billy go to jail?

1225
01:27:47,428 --> 01:27:49,179
-For what?
-Well, if we stop now...

1226
01:27:49,347 --> 01:27:52,015
...I charge him with obstruction,
conspiracy.

1227
01:27:52,183 --> 01:27:55,644
If all he did was carry a body,
you need to take me to the end.

1228
01:28:02,527 --> 01:28:05,946
All I remember is putting my hand
in something wet.

1229
01:28:06,114 --> 01:28:09,700
I remember the smell
and then I was walking.

1230
01:28:09,867 --> 01:28:12,786
I was walking and thinking about...

1231
01:28:12,954 --> 01:28:15,664
...my son, thinking about...

1232
01:28:15,832 --> 01:28:17,958
...living without no--

1233
01:28:18,126 --> 01:28:20,877
Living every day with....

1234
01:28:21,045 --> 01:28:23,922
And I'm like,
"Just walk out into the road.

1235
01:28:24,090 --> 01:28:27,050
Just die." But...

1236
01:28:27,927 --> 01:28:30,178
...I couldn't do it.

1237
01:28:32,140 --> 01:28:36,226
And I'm in this fog, you know.
This fog. And I'm walking...

1238
01:28:36,394 --> 01:28:42,107
...and I wind up in that park, and
I'm clawing and I'm making his--

1239
01:28:42,275 --> 01:28:46,570
Then I had-- I needed to go back
and to get him, and how could I?

1240
01:28:46,738 --> 01:28:49,406
And so I called Billy.

1241
01:28:49,574 --> 01:28:51,575
And what did he do, exactly?

1242
01:28:51,743 --> 01:28:53,577
I was not there, but...

1243
01:28:53,953 --> 01:28:57,456
...he must have gone back up
to my apartment and seen Cody...

1244
01:28:57,623 --> 01:28:59,207
...and put him in my car.

1245
01:28:59,375 --> 01:29:02,544
And I guess I must have told him
where to go because--

1246
01:29:02,712 --> 01:29:04,588
And the stones....

1247
01:29:05,506 --> 01:29:08,759
I guess he did that
to make it proper.

1248
01:29:08,926 --> 01:29:11,428
And then the next night...

1249
01:29:12,430 --> 01:29:14,848
...I-- I must have known
what I was gonna do...

1250
01:29:15,016 --> 01:29:16,850
...but I don't remember
thinking about it.

1251
01:29:17,018 --> 01:29:19,478
I went to Martyrs Park
and I threw my bag in the dirt...

1252
01:29:19,645 --> 01:29:21,980
...and I just started
jamming my hands in the--

1253
01:29:22,148 --> 01:29:25,525
In the shit, just shoving them in.
I just wanted to get every fucking...

1254
01:29:25,693 --> 01:29:29,112
...broken, like, rusted-- Like,
you know, all of it, like, in my skin.

1255
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:31,907
And then I walked through
Armstrong, and I'm--

1256
01:29:32,116 --> 01:29:34,117
I guess I knew I was going
to the hospital...

1257
01:29:34,285 --> 01:29:38,413
...and I guess I knew what I was
gonna say, but I don't remember...

1258
01:29:38,623 --> 01:29:43,043
...knowing the story, the lie,
before it came out of my mouth.

1259
01:29:43,211 --> 01:29:45,962
And I think of it now, I guess
I knew somewhere in my head...

1260
01:29:46,130 --> 01:29:49,299
...that Armstrong could take it.
And that nobody...

1261
01:29:49,467 --> 01:29:53,011
...no individual would really
be hurt by it...

1262
01:29:53,179 --> 01:29:55,972
...and that I could go on,
you know...

1263
01:29:56,766 --> 01:29:58,975
...with some kind of life, but...

1264
01:30:00,478 --> 01:30:02,270
...no, you can't.

1265
01:30:02,980 --> 01:30:04,314
You can't.

1266
01:30:04,982 --> 01:30:06,650
No.

1267
01:30:07,151 --> 01:30:08,402
-What?
-What?

1268
01:30:08,569 --> 01:30:11,113
What is it? They have Cody?

1269
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:13,824
-Is he okay?
-What?

1270
01:30:15,576 --> 01:30:17,452
What--? What did I do?

1271
01:30:17,829 --> 01:30:19,121
Okay, Brenda.

1272
01:30:19,288 --> 01:30:22,833
At this point, I'm gonna have
to charge you with homicide.

1273
01:30:23,167 --> 01:30:26,336
Now, personally,
I have no reason to disbelieve...

1274
01:30:26,504 --> 01:30:28,255
...anything that you've said to me.

1275
01:30:28,423 --> 01:30:30,757
I wouldn't have always been able
to be there for him.

1276
01:30:30,925 --> 01:30:33,510
Well, because of all the
obstruction you put in our path...

1277
01:30:33,678 --> 01:30:35,846
...this is what's required of me.
You understand?

1278
01:30:36,013 --> 01:30:40,016
Now, once the forensics are in, the
charge will probably be downgraded.

1279
01:30:42,603 --> 01:30:45,188
This is Dempsy Detective
Lorenzo Council.

1280
01:30:45,606 --> 01:30:49,359
I'm in the interrogation room of
the Southern District Precinct House.

1281
01:30:49,527 --> 01:30:52,821
It is May 4th, 4:55 p.m.

1282
01:30:52,989 --> 01:30:56,158
I'm with Brenda Martin,
a 37-year-old white female...

1283
01:30:56,325 --> 01:31:00,078
...who resides at 16 Van Loon Street,
Gannon, New Jersey.

1284
01:31:00,246 --> 01:31:03,165
Phone number, 120-7210.

1285
01:31:03,332 --> 01:31:07,627
Social Security number,
983-40-3947.

1286
01:31:07,795 --> 01:31:09,880
-What have I done?
-Statement is in relation...

1287
01:31:10,047 --> 01:31:12,007
...to the death
of 4-year-old Cody Martin.

1288
01:31:14,844 --> 01:31:18,346
Brenda! Hey! Hey!
Stop it. Stop it.

1289
01:31:18,514 --> 01:31:21,475
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
Stop!

1290
01:31:21,642 --> 01:31:24,394
Can I get some help?
Somebody help me!

1291
01:31:24,562 --> 01:31:26,646
Can I get some help in here?

1292
01:31:27,565 --> 01:31:29,065
Calm down! Calm--

1293
01:31:29,734 --> 01:31:31,526
Calm down. Calm down.

1294
01:31:32,069 --> 01:31:34,863
Just take it easy, guys. Take it easy.
Don't hurt her.

1295
01:31:39,744 --> 01:31:41,953
-Okay. It's okay.
-Easy, easy.

1296
01:32:13,361 --> 01:32:15,445
Detective Council.

1297
01:32:16,072 --> 01:32:19,032
How bad was what I did?

1298
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:21,326
I mean, look in your heart.

1299
01:32:21,619 --> 01:32:23,411
How bad was what I did?

1300
01:32:23,704 --> 01:32:26,790
Come on, Billy. Let's go. Come on.

1301
01:32:29,627 --> 01:32:31,044
Look, I don't care what you say.

1302
01:32:31,212 --> 01:32:32,462
-Don't touch me, man!
-No.

1303
01:32:32,630 --> 01:32:35,257
There's nothing you can do.
There's nothing you can do.

1304
01:32:35,424 --> 01:32:38,301
Oh, my goodness. Nothing I can do.
What do you want from me?

1305
01:32:38,469 --> 01:32:39,803
For heaven's sake.

1306
01:32:40,429 --> 01:32:43,306
All units, Code Three.
Code Three at Armstrong Houses.

1307
01:32:43,474 --> 01:32:45,433
This is car 12 responding
to Code Three.

1308
01:32:45,601 --> 01:32:47,811
Code Three at Armstrong Houses.
All units respond.

1309
01:32:47,979 --> 01:32:51,731
-At Armstrong Houses.
-Car 14, Code Six.

1310
01:32:51,899 --> 01:32:55,068
Potential riot disturbance
developing at Armstrong Houses.

1311
01:32:55,987 --> 01:32:59,281
-All units, Code Six.
-Reinforce Unit Three at Jackson.

1312
01:32:59,448 --> 01:33:01,241
All units respond, Code Three.

1313
01:33:05,997 --> 01:33:09,332
All units, Code Three.
Code Three at Armstrong Houses.

1314
01:33:14,338 --> 01:33:16,089
I got it! I got it!

1315
01:33:16,674 --> 01:33:18,174
Do it!

1316
01:33:20,177 --> 01:33:21,511
Help!

1317
01:33:38,154 --> 01:33:39,863
Get the hell out of here!

1318
01:33:48,873 --> 01:33:50,665
Everybody, please.
Go back to your homes!

1319
01:33:50,875 --> 01:33:53,084
Forget you, man!
See, you a punk!

1320
01:33:53,252 --> 01:33:57,047
You need to back off, please.
Everybody.

1321
01:34:08,684 --> 01:34:09,893
-What is it?
-What?!

1322
01:34:10,061 --> 01:34:12,145
Forget it. Don't--
Put your shit back on!

1323
01:34:12,313 --> 01:34:15,023
For your own sakes,
do not let this happen.

1324
01:34:15,191 --> 01:34:17,567
This is not gonna help!

1325
01:34:18,027 --> 01:34:20,028
Come on, SWAT.

1326
01:34:20,905 --> 01:34:22,489
-This is not gonna help!
-Forget it!

1327
01:34:26,035 --> 01:34:27,452
What's wrong with you?

1328
01:34:27,620 --> 01:34:30,914
This is yours.
This is for your family!

1329
01:34:32,249 --> 01:34:35,835
Yeah, I'm coming at you.
Forget y'all, man. Forget y'all!

1330
01:34:36,045 --> 01:34:38,296
Y'all know you ain't
supposed to be doing all this.

1331
01:34:38,464 --> 01:34:41,257
That's right. I wish y'all would move
so I could do something.

1332
01:34:41,425 --> 01:34:43,843
I should bust y'all in your face.
You. Forget y'all.

1333
01:34:46,097 --> 01:34:47,681
Get out of here.

1334
01:34:48,557 --> 01:34:51,226
Lorenzo! Lorenzo!

1335
01:34:51,435 --> 01:34:53,520
Why don't you come up
in here now, motherfucker?

1336
01:34:53,688 --> 01:34:55,689
I just saw that nigger
with that bitch's kid.

1337
01:34:55,856 --> 01:34:58,817
-Don't let him get away, now.
-That jacker's right under my bed.

1338
01:34:58,984 --> 01:35:01,569
-Y'all need a SWAT team.
-Y'all want them to come in here?

1339
01:35:01,737 --> 01:35:04,948
-Hell, yeah.
-No. No, you don't.

1340
01:35:05,116 --> 01:35:07,617
-Man, fuck you!
-Look, you see these cops?

1341
01:35:07,785 --> 01:35:10,620
They are just the tip of the iceberg.

1342
01:35:11,122 --> 01:35:14,582
Every cop in Dempsy and Gannon
is on alert.

1343
01:35:14,750 --> 01:35:18,461
There's a hell of a lot more of them
than there are tenants in here.

1344
01:35:18,629 --> 01:35:20,380
So if this shit jumps off...

1345
01:35:20,673 --> 01:35:23,633
...they gonna turn into
one big-ass police force...

1346
01:35:23,801 --> 01:35:26,302
...that's gonna be in here
kicking down our doors!

1347
01:35:26,470 --> 01:35:28,471
-"Our doors," huh?
-Please.

1348
01:35:28,639 --> 01:35:31,558
What you talking about, man?
You ain't one of us. Come on.

1349
01:35:32,143 --> 01:35:34,394
We ain't tolerating!

1350
01:35:35,354 --> 01:35:36,980
Leo?

1351
01:35:41,902 --> 01:35:44,988
Oh, so you all concerned
with city lines now and shit.

1352
01:35:45,489 --> 01:35:48,283
You take care of your town,
we'll take care of ours.

1353
01:35:48,868 --> 01:35:50,994
Just get them out of sight, all right?

1354
01:35:51,162 --> 01:35:54,664
You about to start the very thing
you supposed to be here preventing.

1355
01:35:54,832 --> 01:36:00,503
-When they step off, we'll step off.
-No, you step off, then they'll step off.

1356
01:36:03,716 --> 01:36:07,135
Just back them up.
I'll handle my end, all right?

1357
01:36:21,233 --> 01:36:22,901
Everybody play it cool.
Play it cool.

1358
01:36:23,068 --> 01:36:25,320
-Wanna piece of me?
-What the fuck you looking at?

1359
01:36:28,783 --> 01:36:30,784
You have a good night now,
you hear.

1360
01:36:38,334 --> 01:36:40,543
Rafik! Rafik!

1361
01:36:40,711 --> 01:36:42,629
-No!
-Can I help you with something?

1362
01:36:44,381 --> 01:36:46,049
No!

1363
01:36:46,342 --> 01:36:47,675
Hey!

1364
01:36:48,886 --> 01:36:50,720
-Come on, Rafik. Rafik!
-Don't do it.

1365
01:36:51,388 --> 01:36:53,556
Don't do it!

1366
01:37:03,400 --> 01:37:05,151
Get him out of here.

1367
01:39:40,224 --> 01:39:41,683
Miss Martin.

1368
01:39:41,850 --> 01:39:44,435
I have a charge here
of criminal negligence in the death...

1369
01:39:44,603 --> 01:39:47,063
...of Cody Martin
signed by Detective Lorenzo Council...

1370
01:39:47,231 --> 01:39:48,856
...of the Dempsy Police Department.

1371
01:39:49,358 --> 01:39:52,610
Do you understand
the charge as read to you?

1372
01:39:53,737 --> 01:39:55,613
Miss Martin?

1373
01:39:57,533 --> 01:39:59,701
How's your reception, counselor?
Can you see us?

1374
01:39:59,868 --> 01:40:01,828
Yes, we can, Your Honor.

1375
01:40:01,996 --> 01:40:03,329
Miss Martin?

1376
01:40:04,081 --> 01:40:06,374
Do you understand the charge?

1377
01:40:14,883 --> 01:40:16,759
Yes.

1378
01:40:53,130 --> 01:40:55,548
They gave us some deluxe
elbow room in here, huh?

1379
01:41:02,473 --> 01:41:04,557
So they got you
in protective custody, huh?

1380
01:41:04,725 --> 01:41:06,642
On suicide watch too.

1381
01:41:07,311 --> 01:41:09,312
It's just standard procedure.

1382
01:41:13,192 --> 01:41:16,235
You know, you aren't the only person
I got to visit in here today.

1383
01:41:16,403 --> 01:41:18,154
My son, Jason...

1384
01:41:19,323 --> 01:41:22,325
...he's over in the state wing
doing two to four for armed robbery.

1385
01:41:22,493 --> 01:41:24,035
No.

1386
01:41:24,203 --> 01:41:26,329
-Used my gun too.
-Oh, no.

1387
01:41:26,497 --> 01:41:28,081
Yeah.

1388
01:41:28,415 --> 01:41:30,249
All my friends say to me:

1389
01:41:30,417 --> 01:41:34,003
"Lorenzo, it ain't your fault
that boy landed where he did.

1390
01:41:34,171 --> 01:41:36,839
He got to take responsibility
for that his own self.

1391
01:41:37,007 --> 01:41:40,176
I ain't seen no pacifier in his mouth
the last 10 years."

1392
01:41:40,344 --> 01:41:44,097
Well, between you and me,
it is my fault.

1393
01:41:44,890 --> 01:41:48,768
I do feel responsible
because the kind of man he is...

1394
01:41:48,936 --> 01:41:51,687
...is the kind of man
I showed him how to be.

1395
01:41:51,855 --> 01:41:54,357
High all the time.

1396
01:41:54,525 --> 01:41:57,401
Selfish. Out of control.

1397
01:41:57,569 --> 01:41:59,654
I was never there
on a day-to-day basis.

1398
01:41:59,863 --> 01:42:03,074
And when I was,
I was fighting with his moms.

1399
01:42:04,868 --> 01:42:07,787
Yeah, well, that's who I was.

1400
01:42:08,539 --> 01:42:10,498
I'm so sorry.

1401
01:42:12,751 --> 01:42:14,627
Back then...

1402
01:42:15,045 --> 01:42:17,380
...I just didn't give a shit.

1403
01:42:18,006 --> 01:42:19,298
Now Jason's in prison...

1404
01:42:19,883 --> 01:42:23,970
...and he'll probably be in and out
of prison the rest of his life.

1405
01:42:24,221 --> 01:42:26,097
It's kind of late in the game...

1406
01:42:26,265 --> 01:42:28,683
...but all I wanna do now
is be there for him.

1407
01:42:31,520 --> 01:42:33,312
But with kids...

1408
01:42:33,480 --> 01:42:37,733
...no matter what you did or how bad
you think you messed up...

1409
01:42:37,901 --> 01:42:41,529
...God always finds a way
to give you another shot at it.

1410
01:42:41,697 --> 01:42:44,407
It might not be
with that particular child, but....

1411
01:42:47,744 --> 01:42:50,913
What I'm trying to say, Brenda...

1412
01:42:51,081 --> 01:42:54,917
...is that God's grace
is sort of, like, retroactive.

1413
01:42:55,085 --> 01:42:58,838
So every little kid out there
is Jason for me now.

1414
01:42:59,506 --> 01:43:02,842
And, no, they're not my blood,
but I can live with that.

1415
01:43:03,010 --> 01:43:05,928
And I'm happy. My life is good.

1416
01:43:09,224 --> 01:43:11,225
There's a lot of young women
in here, Brenda.

1417
01:43:11,435 --> 01:43:15,730
Some of them are good mothers,
some ain't. But they all need help.

1418
01:43:15,939 --> 01:43:20,484
On visitors' day, in the nursery,
even in prenatal.

1419
01:43:20,652 --> 01:43:23,237
And the warden in here
is an old running buddy of mine--

1420
01:43:23,447 --> 01:43:24,739
I love you.

1421
01:43:25,115 --> 01:43:26,407
What?

1422
01:43:26,575 --> 01:43:29,785
I love you for the way
you talk to me.

1423
01:43:30,245 --> 01:43:32,371
I've loved you
for the way you talk to me...

1424
01:43:32,539 --> 01:43:34,874
...ever since I first met you
in the hospital.

1425
01:43:36,543 --> 01:43:38,294
I wish I had your heart.

1426
01:43:42,716 --> 01:43:47,803
Look, I don't know if your lawyer
is gonna do a plea bargain...

1427
01:43:47,971 --> 01:43:50,473
...or whatever,
or if you're going to trial.

1428
01:43:50,641 --> 01:43:54,018
But you'll still be a young woman.
Lots of things that you can--

1429
01:43:59,483 --> 01:44:02,235
I'll-- I'll--
I'll come see you.

1430
01:44:02,861 --> 01:44:04,237
Brenda...

1431
01:44:04,404 --> 01:44:07,240
...reach out to people in here,
all right?

1432
01:44:32,724 --> 01:44:34,725
Jayce, how you doing?

1433
01:44:34,893 --> 01:44:36,936
Wasn't you just here
on Tuesday, man?

1434
01:44:38,021 --> 01:44:39,355
You want me to leave?

1435
01:44:40,565 --> 01:44:43,109
No, it's all good.
It's Christmas in July.

1436
01:44:44,236 --> 01:44:46,821
So like I said,
how you doing, kid?

1437
01:44:47,155 --> 01:44:49,782
You know, the Aryan Nation
was asking me to hook up...

1438
01:44:49,950 --> 01:44:53,577
...but I was a little bit nervous about
the whole initiation thing, you know?

1439
01:45:01,128 --> 01:45:03,963
Hey, Dad, you--? You okay?

1440
01:45:06,300 --> 01:45:07,883
Yeah.

1441
01:45:09,052 --> 01:45:10,886
Yeah, I'm good.

1442
01:45:12,389 --> 01:45:14,140
I'm real good.

1443
01:45:22,607 --> 01:45:25,401
-So, what you think?
-I was looking at that.

1444
01:45:25,569 --> 01:45:27,236
What's going on with you?

1445
01:45:27,404 --> 01:45:29,739
You know, out there
roughnecking.

1446
01:45:29,906 --> 01:45:33,409
-So you fell off your bed.
-Yeah, right....

1447
01:45:52,679 --> 01:45:55,139
I thought you should see this.

1448
01:45:57,309 --> 01:45:58,642
Hey.

1449
01:46:01,938 --> 01:46:04,398
You know that thing
with the carjacker?

1450
01:46:05,108 --> 01:46:08,652
I know I'm supposed to find it
in my heart to forgive.

1451
01:46:08,820 --> 01:46:10,321
But....

1452
01:46:12,157 --> 01:46:14,575
And her with Billy.

1453
01:46:14,743 --> 01:46:16,952
I mean, he wasn't getting none
from me, so....

1454
01:46:19,456 --> 01:46:24,752
But, Lorenzo, did he have anything
to do with hurting that child?

1455
01:46:26,630 --> 01:46:28,714
No. No, he didn't.

1456
01:46:32,928 --> 01:46:36,138
Thank you. Thank you.

1457
01:47:35,824 --> 01:47:38,701
"This child's life was not in vain.

1458
01:47:39,619 --> 01:47:42,872
He brought us together
in a common bond of sadness.

1459
01:47:43,498 --> 01:47:46,292
He reminded us
how human we are...

1460
01:47:47,210 --> 01:47:50,921
...and how hurt and pain
touches us all.

1461
01:47:51,590 --> 01:47:56,552
Go to God, little angel.
And thank you."

1462
01:48:22,329 --> 01:48:25,039
I really appreciate you bringing
me out here, Bobby.

1463
01:48:25,248 --> 01:48:26,999
I truly do.
