1
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:12,995
Binh!

2
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,871
We should get married.
Our ages are well-matched.

3
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,508
You want someone
to make you dinner every day.

4
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:01,757
That was the idea.

5
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,275
What do I get out of it?

6
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:11,394
It will be a good arrangement.

7
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,992
I will be like a father to your children.

8
00:03:15,559 --> 00:03:19,437
Everyone will have enough to eat,
even pig face here.

9
00:03:20,998 --> 00:03:22,750
Why is he so grouchy?

10
00:03:25,078 --> 00:03:29,117
If you marry me, I'll fix up the house.

11
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:08,756
You have to clean it!

12
00:04:09,398 --> 00:04:10,467
Hurry!

13
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:15,516
I need it tonight.

14
00:04:24,558 --> 00:04:25,911
Come!

15
00:04:26,118 --> 00:04:29,110
Hurry! The celebration starts soon!

16
00:04:58,957 --> 00:05:03,667
...since the liberation, significant progress
has been made in the spirit of Ho Chi Minh.

17
00:05:07,277 --> 00:05:08,790
Will you marry Pham?

18
00:05:12,037 --> 00:05:13,265
Who knows?

19
00:05:24,717 --> 00:05:27,072
What did my mother say about the Gl?

20
00:05:29,277 --> 00:05:30,596
Your father?

21
00:05:33,597 --> 00:05:34,586
Yes.

22
00:05:38,757 --> 00:05:41,715
Why do you ask now?

23
00:05:51,077 --> 00:05:54,387
-She must have said something.
-She cried about him.

24
00:05:55,197 --> 00:05:56,471
That's all?

25
00:05:57,157 --> 00:06:00,706
He had very big feet.

26
00:06:03,077 --> 00:06:07,036
First, he tracks dirt all over the house...

27
00:06:07,677 --> 00:06:11,191
then he takes off his leather shoes.

28
00:06:11,756 --> 00:06:16,147
He puts up his big feet
so that everyone can see.

29
00:06:20,876 --> 00:06:22,229
Is she alive?

30
00:06:32,196 --> 00:06:33,993
If she marries Pham...

31
00:06:34,516 --> 00:06:37,747
there won't be room for you.

32
00:06:42,436 --> 00:06:43,915
She is alive.

33
00:06:48,236 --> 00:06:49,749
In the big city.

34
00:07:13,116 --> 00:07:16,153
-Why are you always angry with him?
-I can't bear the sight of him.

35
00:07:16,276 --> 00:07:20,235
He's not one of us. I don't know why
he doesn't go to where he belongs.

36
00:08:29,835 --> 00:08:33,384
And for my forefathers,
I pray for their souls...

37
00:08:33,595 --> 00:08:36,792
and that we someday will be united.

38
00:08:37,315 --> 00:08:40,432
For myself, I ask that my actions
will not harm others.

39
00:08:40,555 --> 00:08:43,149
I do not leave with a bitter heart...

40
00:08:43,275 --> 00:08:45,948
but with hope that I will have a better future.

41
00:10:36,793 --> 00:10:38,511
You're Bui Doi, aren't you?

42
00:10:40,793 --> 00:10:43,626
Go home. There's nothing for you here.

43
00:10:45,033 --> 00:10:46,705
Consider yourself lucky.

44
00:10:47,753 --> 00:10:49,186
I'm looking for Mai.

45
00:10:50,713 --> 00:10:52,465
She used to work here.

46
00:10:56,553 --> 00:10:57,827
She's my mother.

47
00:11:31,913 --> 00:11:33,551
Does Mai live here?

48
00:11:33,713 --> 00:11:36,864
Go away, beggar!

49
00:11:45,353 --> 00:11:46,991
I know you.

50
00:11:55,832 --> 00:11:58,062
You are very big, my brother.

51
00:11:59,232 --> 00:12:00,745
Where is Mother?

52
00:12:01,272 --> 00:12:02,910
She's at work...

53
00:12:04,512 --> 00:12:05,831
in the big house.

54
00:12:32,912 --> 00:12:36,302
If you have a problem,
don't bother our guests with it.

55
00:12:46,112 --> 00:12:49,821
Mai! You don't work
in the dining room anymore.

56
00:12:50,192 --> 00:12:52,626
Give me your uniform. Hurry.

57
00:13:13,871 --> 00:13:17,341
Good evening. Do you know who I am?

58
00:13:22,311 --> 00:13:23,460
It's me.

59
00:13:25,071 --> 00:13:26,345
It's Binh.

60
00:13:52,311 --> 00:13:54,620
I am so sorry, my son.

61
00:14:27,831 --> 00:14:28,820
Mai.

62
00:14:33,111 --> 00:14:34,305
Will you wait?

63
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,298
Thank you.

64
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:43,943
You're hungry?

65
00:16:40,349 --> 00:16:41,862
What are you thinking?

66
00:16:51,949 --> 00:16:53,507
I am thinking...

67
00:16:55,469 --> 00:16:57,266
that I don't know you.

68
00:17:03,309 --> 00:17:05,220
You know, we were married...

69
00:17:06,429 --> 00:17:08,863
in a church.

70
00:17:09,909 --> 00:17:11,422
He was Christian?

71
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:14,746
He never said...

72
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:18,788
but he wanted a priest.

73
00:17:30,148 --> 00:17:33,857
Where is he? What happened to him?

74
00:17:36,548 --> 00:17:38,584
He was here one day...

75
00:17:40,508 --> 00:17:42,066
then he was gone.

76
00:17:44,588 --> 00:17:46,067
Just like that.

77
00:17:46,788 --> 00:17:47,903
Killed?

78
00:17:48,948 --> 00:17:52,338
He was just gone.

79
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:04,099
It was a hard time for everyone.

80
00:18:23,028 --> 00:18:25,303
Madam, if you have a moment.

81
00:18:26,028 --> 00:18:28,223
It's her son.

82
00:18:28,788 --> 00:18:30,904
He will be a good worker...

83
00:18:31,508 --> 00:18:34,818
alongside her...

84
00:18:35,428 --> 00:18:38,420
to replace the houseboy.

85
00:18:41,508 --> 00:18:43,863
Far greater value than what you pay now.

86
00:18:46,788 --> 00:18:48,426
Let me look at you.

87
00:18:53,547 --> 00:18:56,937
Your mother is attractive.
How did you get to be so ugly?

88
00:18:57,547 --> 00:19:00,459
I know you are generous, madam.

89
00:19:02,147 --> 00:19:05,935
I know that you know
what it means to love a son, and--

90
00:19:06,387 --> 00:19:08,218
He will shine my son's shoes.

91
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:12,825
The rugs need beating.
He can assist his mother in that.

92
00:19:13,347 --> 00:19:16,145
And the fence has to be painted.

93
00:19:17,187 --> 00:19:20,304
Work hard. Help your mother.

94
00:19:21,227 --> 00:19:23,661
She's suffered a lot because of you.

95
00:20:35,586 --> 00:20:36,985
Working hard?

96
00:20:41,346 --> 00:20:43,177
Let me give you a hand.

97
00:20:59,106 --> 00:21:02,496
Please, no. I must finish,
or your mother will be angry.

98
00:21:12,106 --> 00:21:13,619
Is he Tam's father?

99
00:21:15,146 --> 00:21:16,784
How dare you ask me that?

100
00:21:47,185 --> 00:21:50,541
-You were gone a long time.
-I'm sorry.

101
00:21:51,865 --> 00:21:52,934
Quiet!

102
00:21:53,385 --> 00:21:55,535
-You have shortchanged me.
-No.

103
00:21:55,905 --> 00:21:58,419
First he steals from me, then he lies.

104
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:08,335
That's what you get
for bringing such trash into the house!

105
00:22:14,745 --> 00:22:16,975
I don't know how to protect you.

106
00:22:19,105 --> 00:22:22,256
I have shamed you. I'll go back to Hoa Nam.

107
00:22:22,385 --> 00:22:24,979
No. I'm proud of you.

108
00:22:30,745 --> 00:22:33,305
Just stay out of his way.

109
00:22:59,345 --> 00:23:00,937
Binh, help me.

110
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,458
Careful!

111
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:29,343
Put that down!

112
00:23:29,464 --> 00:23:32,661
Thief! Bastard thief!

113
00:24:09,304 --> 00:24:10,976
You must take Tam as well.

114
00:24:16,104 --> 00:24:18,937
-Come with us, Mother!
-No.

115
00:24:22,624 --> 00:24:25,775
I have a friend.
He knows of boats, special boats.

116
00:24:35,063 --> 00:24:37,736
It will just be enough for the two of you.

117
00:24:39,863 --> 00:24:42,616
This is my wedding certificate.

118
00:24:42,743 --> 00:24:45,052
On it is an address in Houston, Texas.

119
00:24:45,183 --> 00:24:48,095
He may help, but ask for nothing.

120
00:25:00,143 --> 00:25:01,701
Keep a good heart.

121
00:25:05,943 --> 00:25:07,774
Don't let Tam forget me.

122
00:25:12,463 --> 00:25:16,217
You're going to go on a trip with Binh.

123
00:25:17,503 --> 00:25:20,301
Mama, where will you be?

124
00:25:20,423 --> 00:25:23,620
I'll come. Just not now.

125
00:25:24,063 --> 00:25:26,372
Do what Binh says.

126
00:25:26,903 --> 00:25:30,452
Mother will be along soon.
We'll all be together in America.

127
00:27:23,061 --> 00:27:24,619
Where you going?

128
00:27:28,141 --> 00:27:30,974
-America.
-What will you do there?

129
00:27:32,661 --> 00:27:36,017
Sell shoes. Everyone needs shoes.

130
00:27:38,221 --> 00:27:39,973
You have family there?

131
00:27:43,461 --> 00:27:44,974
You have family there?

132
00:27:49,821 --> 00:27:51,493
He's not Vietnamese.

133
00:27:54,341 --> 00:27:55,979
He's a big American.

134
00:30:33,059 --> 00:30:34,617
Tam, come here!

135
00:30:36,339 --> 00:30:37,374
Tam!

136
00:31:01,859 --> 00:31:03,577
Where were you going?

137
00:31:07,539 --> 00:31:09,211
Where were you going?

138
00:31:15,059 --> 00:31:17,732
-Malaysia.
-Nobody tries for Malaysia.

139
00:31:19,339 --> 00:31:21,295
America is a nice place.

140
00:31:22,379 --> 00:31:25,610
Have you been in prison before
for political reasons?

141
00:31:27,659 --> 00:31:29,138
For criminal reasons?

142
00:31:30,419 --> 00:31:32,057
Was your father American?

143
00:31:33,098 --> 00:31:35,373
-He Vietnamese.
-Open your mouth.

144
00:31:40,138 --> 00:31:42,777
-What is his name?
-Duc.

145
00:31:46,538 --> 00:31:48,415
You can put your shirt on.

146
00:31:52,418 --> 00:31:54,295
Why do you leave Vietnam?

147
00:31:56,658 --> 00:31:58,933
It's to your benefit to tell the truth.

148
00:32:19,778 --> 00:32:20,767
Come.

149
00:32:26,658 --> 00:32:29,456
Don't worry. Be here when you get back...

150
00:32:29,898 --> 00:32:31,775
just like everyone else.

151
00:32:34,818 --> 00:32:36,570
I'll be back soon.

152
00:33:41,537 --> 00:33:42,731
English?

153
00:33:43,657 --> 00:33:47,411
Good! My English very good.
My name Chingmy.

154
00:33:49,897 --> 00:33:54,254
-What this place?
-"What this place?" This place hell!

155
00:33:55,777 --> 00:33:58,530
-Me Chinese. What you?
-Vietnamese.

156
00:33:58,937 --> 00:33:59,972
Vietnamese.

157
00:34:09,057 --> 00:34:10,456
Why you here?

158
00:34:10,777 --> 00:34:14,531
You know, boat from China. Sink off coast.

159
00:34:15,537 --> 00:34:17,687
Many people go underwater, too.

160
00:34:19,177 --> 00:34:22,566
-How I leave?
-You want to leave? Good!

161
00:34:24,376 --> 00:34:28,085
No one leaves here. No country wants you.

162
00:34:29,016 --> 00:34:32,452
You grow old. God take you a better place.

163
00:34:37,736 --> 00:34:38,771
Not yet.

164
00:34:39,056 --> 00:34:42,651
Or you can like me. I am a very clever guy.

165
00:34:43,056 --> 00:34:44,967
I can go under the wall.

166
00:34:46,536 --> 00:34:49,004
-There other way?
-Sure!

167
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:52,174
You grow wings, you can fly over the wall.

168
00:34:53,736 --> 00:34:58,173
Or you can like Ling.
Ling go over wall on her back.

169
00:35:02,056 --> 00:35:03,091
No?

170
00:35:05,176 --> 00:35:06,325
Oh, thank you.

171
00:35:07,056 --> 00:35:10,446
She earn big money.
She can buy her way out!

172
00:35:10,736 --> 00:35:12,454
If I could, I would.

173
00:35:13,216 --> 00:35:15,730
But, you know, I'm not pretty like her.

174
00:35:17,536 --> 00:35:19,094
You want to leave?

175
00:36:03,815 --> 00:36:07,603
Did you buy the birthday presents?

176
00:37:00,335 --> 00:37:03,293
Tam, time to go.
You can help me with the food.

177
00:37:04,095 --> 00:37:05,050
No.

178
00:37:25,854 --> 00:37:28,846
-How you come here?
-Take boat.

179
00:37:30,534 --> 00:37:31,683
Where you go?

180
00:37:33,894 --> 00:37:36,328
-America.
-America, huh?

181
00:37:41,414 --> 00:37:42,767
Beautiful country.

182
00:37:46,574 --> 00:37:48,132
You like America?

183
00:37:52,934 --> 00:37:54,447
What you do there?

184
00:37:59,254 --> 00:38:00,289
Sell shoe.

185
00:38:06,574 --> 00:38:09,134
-Where you from?
-Why?

186
00:38:24,174 --> 00:38:28,213
I from Pingyao. Small village, North China.

187
00:38:29,374 --> 00:38:31,649
Father leave when I very small.

188
00:38:40,853 --> 00:38:44,846
I come here with man.
One day he say to me:.

189
00:38:46,013 --> 00:38:50,131
"l get you out.
First, go Hong Kong. Good life."

190
00:38:51,533 --> 00:38:53,364
Mother still in China?

191
00:39:02,733 --> 00:39:06,043
-More good she think I dead.
-Why?

192
00:39:07,653 --> 00:39:08,972
I shame her.

193
00:39:29,933 --> 00:39:31,161
I'm hungry.

194
00:39:31,293 --> 00:39:34,126
We'll try to find something to eat
after we wash.

195
00:40:23,372 --> 00:40:24,964
I wash it for you.

196
00:40:39,612 --> 00:40:42,570
-Why you like that?
-Like what?

197
00:40:44,252 --> 00:40:45,810
You no look at me.

198
00:40:47,532 --> 00:40:48,965
I look at you.

199
00:41:05,692 --> 00:41:07,171
Never play like this.

200
00:41:10,252 --> 00:41:13,005
Other mothers say, "No play with him.

201
00:41:14,892 --> 00:41:16,769
"He have face of enemy."

202
00:41:27,131 --> 00:41:29,406
We must get out, Tam and me.

203
00:41:30,451 --> 00:41:32,760
Leave here, take money. Big money.

204
00:41:33,451 --> 00:41:34,884
I have dollars.

205
00:41:35,851 --> 00:41:38,649
I think you in shoe store, when you gone.

206
00:41:43,451 --> 00:41:44,566
Put on.

207
00:43:40,770 --> 00:43:42,567
You leave this place.

208
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:45,003
I no leave you.

209
00:43:49,010 --> 00:43:50,568
Boat come tonight.

210
00:43:52,050 --> 00:43:53,449
How you know?

211
00:43:59,330 --> 00:44:02,686
Boat go to America.
You have $2,000, they take you.

212
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:06,124
In America, you work for them. Pay rest.

213
00:44:07,210 --> 00:44:08,563
How you know?

214
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:14,361
I no have $2,000.

215
00:44:21,369 --> 00:44:22,722
Almost done.

216
00:44:23,489 --> 00:44:25,719
Clean, very clean.

217
00:44:32,769 --> 00:44:33,884
Get up!

218
00:45:07,529 --> 00:45:08,518
Back!

219
00:45:11,769 --> 00:45:13,282
Everyone back!

220
00:45:39,529 --> 00:45:42,042
Get your things. Let's go!

221
00:46:08,128 --> 00:46:09,447
You go first.

222
00:46:09,568 --> 00:46:13,766
-No, come now.
-Too small for three. You go.

223
00:46:14,928 --> 00:46:18,398
Here, $2,000. For you, for Tam.

224
00:46:20,808 --> 00:46:23,322
You go now. Boat won't wait. Go.

225
00:46:26,968 --> 00:46:28,083
You go.

226
00:46:42,728 --> 00:46:44,684
This boat no leave without Ling.

227
00:46:45,648 --> 00:46:46,922
I no swim.

228
00:46:50,128 --> 00:46:51,925
I already dead inside.

229
00:46:53,968 --> 00:46:57,756
In water, also dead outside. So you go.

230
00:46:59,648 --> 00:47:00,763
Please.

231
00:47:26,247 --> 00:47:28,158
Is Mummy on the boat?

232
00:48:27,047 --> 00:48:28,560
Hold them there.

233
00:48:33,766 --> 00:48:35,916
Thought you were from Miami.

234
00:48:39,366 --> 00:48:42,085
Where'd you find these, then? In the ocean?

235
00:48:42,206 --> 00:48:45,039
Okay, let's see the money.
Money, money, money!

236
00:48:49,166 --> 00:48:51,475
Come down. You speak English?

237
00:48:53,206 --> 00:48:54,355
You read?

238
00:48:54,886 --> 00:48:55,921
Good.

239
00:48:57,326 --> 00:49:00,636
The passage is gonna cost $8,000,
for the three of you.

240
00:49:00,766 --> 00:49:02,438
It's a family discount.

241
00:49:02,566 --> 00:49:06,036
-You work for the rest in US.
-ln camp, tells me $2,000.

242
00:49:08,286 --> 00:49:11,244
In camp, they're salesmen.
I'm a businessman.

243
00:49:11,806 --> 00:49:15,003
$2,000 each for you and the lady,
$4,000 for the kid.

244
00:49:15,206 --> 00:49:18,596
Why boy no cheap? Only small.

245
00:49:19,326 --> 00:49:20,600
Eat little.

246
00:49:21,286 --> 00:49:24,323
He's not a worker, is he?
He just takes up space.

247
00:49:24,646 --> 00:49:26,045
Little space.

248
00:49:26,406 --> 00:49:28,158
Big space in your mind.

249
00:49:28,286 --> 00:49:31,722
$2,000, 50, 60, 70....

250
00:49:34,526 --> 00:49:36,994
$2,773.

251
00:49:38,406 --> 00:49:41,000
You can swim to America.
Be my guest, if that's your wish.

252
00:49:41,126 --> 00:49:43,242
Where's the rest?

253
00:49:45,566 --> 00:49:46,965
Have no more.

254
00:49:47,366 --> 00:49:50,915
"Have no more?" Have no travel. Goodbye.

255
00:49:52,246 --> 00:49:53,599
Have no more!

256
00:50:12,525 --> 00:50:13,958
Sign your name.

257
00:50:15,325 --> 00:50:16,678
No read Chinese.

258
00:50:17,405 --> 00:50:20,078
You can sign your name
in whatever you want.

259
00:50:20,205 --> 00:50:22,196
-Sign it.
-What it say?

260
00:50:23,325 --> 00:50:27,398
Well, it says you'll give me $2,773 now.

261
00:50:27,525 --> 00:50:30,437
When you get there, you'll all work,
including the kid.

262
00:50:30,565 --> 00:50:34,274
If you're not lazy, you'll be free to leave
in a year. In your case, two.

263
00:50:34,405 --> 00:50:36,965
We'll provide a place to stay,
food, and work.

264
00:50:40,805 --> 00:50:42,682
I think you should sign.

265
00:50:56,005 --> 00:50:58,394
Where boat going? Houston?

266
00:50:59,525 --> 00:51:01,083
This isn't a taxi.

267
00:51:34,124 --> 00:51:35,682
Everybody on deck.

268
00:51:41,564 --> 00:51:43,998
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome aboard.

269
00:51:44,644 --> 00:51:46,919
You're our most valued passengers.

270
00:51:47,404 --> 00:51:49,998
We want you to arrive healthy
and fit to work.

271
00:51:50,884 --> 00:51:51,873
So...

272
00:51:53,524 --> 00:51:57,199
don't fight. Don't waste food.

273
00:51:57,644 --> 00:52:00,283
We have enough, but not enough to waste.

274
00:52:01,124 --> 00:52:03,240
You'll all be rich in America.

275
00:52:06,204 --> 00:52:07,842
I'm told it's easy.

276
00:52:10,164 --> 00:52:11,313
Come on.

277
00:52:36,684 --> 00:52:38,242
Smells bad.

278
00:52:38,804 --> 00:52:41,034
In America, always smell good.

279
00:52:41,164 --> 00:52:44,439
-Why?
-They clean all day.

280
00:52:45,043 --> 00:52:48,001
-Why?
-People make money that way.

281
00:52:48,523 --> 00:52:50,320
Lots and lots of money.

282
00:52:50,563 --> 00:52:53,031
Cleaners have big car.

283
00:52:53,683 --> 00:52:55,639
I want to clean in America.

284
00:53:06,883 --> 00:53:08,475
Go to back of line.

285
00:53:23,043 --> 00:53:24,556
We pay for food.

286
00:53:25,723 --> 00:53:26,951
You no pay me.

287
00:53:42,043 --> 00:53:43,271
Thank you.

288
00:53:48,923 --> 00:53:50,675
My brother need water.

289
00:53:51,003 --> 00:53:53,039
Don't look at me, chappie.

290
00:54:16,802 --> 00:54:18,030
Come down.

291
00:54:20,042 --> 00:54:21,873
You think this is funny?

292
00:54:45,762 --> 00:54:47,434
You think he's ugly?

293
00:54:59,802 --> 00:55:00,996
Be nice.

294
00:55:03,402 --> 00:55:04,801
Come with me.

295
00:55:16,442 --> 00:55:18,000
Now listen to me.

296
00:55:19,962 --> 00:55:23,750
These are my passengers. Mine, not yours.

297
00:55:25,082 --> 00:55:28,074
If I lose any of them, including you...

298
00:55:30,682 --> 00:55:32,035
I lose money.

299
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:49,433
Are you scared of me?

300
00:55:50,521 --> 00:55:52,591
You know, I've been to your country.

301
00:55:52,721 --> 00:55:56,191
I've been to both of your countries,
and I'll tell you something.

302
00:55:56,641 --> 00:56:00,316
You will always be out of place
wherever you go.

303
00:56:01,641 --> 00:56:02,960
Yes, I know.

304
00:56:03,361 --> 00:56:04,555
And poor.

305
00:56:05,401 --> 00:56:06,675
Yes, I know.

306
00:56:15,561 --> 00:56:19,270
You should think about working for me.
I can give you a job.

307
00:56:27,361 --> 00:56:30,000
-You like looking at me?
-Yes.

308
00:56:34,361 --> 00:56:37,512
This is my look on-stage. I'll be big singer.

309
00:56:39,121 --> 00:56:40,395
You pretty.

310
00:56:48,321 --> 00:56:49,834
Place your bets.

311
00:56:51,761 --> 00:56:52,716
Bet!

312
00:56:53,281 --> 00:56:54,839
-Q-Tip.
-Passport.

313
00:56:55,641 --> 00:56:57,199
Kennedy Airport.

314
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:01,354
You lose.

315
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:09,353
Very easy game.

316
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:11,319
I have no money.

317
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:49,555
No.

318
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:49,707
-Have you done my shoes?
-Yes, sir. I finish.

319
00:59:59,718 --> 01:00:00,946
Come here.

320
01:00:07,558 --> 01:00:09,389
You have an independent mind.

321
01:00:11,798 --> 01:00:14,028
Some people admire that.

322
01:00:15,238 --> 01:00:16,512
I don't.

323
01:01:33,157 --> 01:01:35,512
The storm has damaged a water tank.

324
01:01:36,877 --> 01:01:39,152
The rice is wet and rotting.

325
01:01:41,197 --> 01:01:43,552
As of today, we are on half-rations.

326
01:01:45,877 --> 01:01:47,549
It's enough to live.

327
01:01:52,157 --> 01:01:54,387
I think you should bring up your dead.

328
01:02:08,637 --> 01:02:10,593
That what Mickey Mouse eat.

329
01:02:11,837 --> 01:02:12,826
Look.

330
01:02:23,437 --> 01:02:24,870
Two more dead.

331
01:03:03,756 --> 01:03:05,155
Place your bet!

332
01:03:05,276 --> 01:03:07,665
-Harvard University.
-NBA.

333
01:03:07,876 --> 01:03:10,151
-Folgers Coffee.
-Clint Eastwood.

334
01:03:15,116 --> 01:03:18,153
You cannot. You cannot take my food.
It is for my daughter.

335
01:03:18,276 --> 01:03:19,675
You cannot!

336
01:03:35,036 --> 01:03:36,469
May I help you?

337
01:03:40,356 --> 01:03:42,472
You're tampering with my cargo.

338
01:03:43,876 --> 01:03:46,549
Your cargo likes to gamble.
I can't change that.

339
01:03:50,596 --> 01:03:53,986
You chartered a ship
and placed a cargo in its hold, uninsured.

340
01:03:54,596 --> 01:03:56,473
I don't think it would be
in your best interests...

341
01:03:56,596 --> 01:03:58,826
to challenge the command of this ship.

342
01:04:00,236 --> 01:04:03,193
We both get paid
for what we deliver on arrival.

343
01:04:03,795 --> 01:04:06,548
That's what I'm interested in.
So should you.

344
01:04:32,035 --> 01:04:34,071
You might want to get that seen to.

345
01:04:34,435 --> 01:04:37,268
There's no food. They're dropping like flies.

346
01:04:37,915 --> 01:04:40,304
There won't be anybody left to sell
at this rate.

347
01:04:40,435 --> 01:04:42,710
We had enough, and now we don't.
It's as simple as that.

348
01:04:42,835 --> 01:04:47,147
Well, let's go in to Luanda. We're only
50 miles offshore. Get some more supplies.

349
01:04:48,195 --> 01:04:51,904
And send you to the market?
You're a fucking amateur.

350
01:04:52,515 --> 01:04:53,743
You know that?

351
01:04:53,875 --> 01:04:55,593
You don't have the stomach
for your own greed.

352
01:04:55,715 --> 01:04:58,548
People die all the time.
It's as natural as living.

353
01:04:58,955 --> 01:05:01,992
They're dying because
of your mismanagement of the ship.

354
01:05:03,075 --> 01:05:05,145
It's coming out of your share.

355
01:05:14,155 --> 01:05:15,304
No, it isn't.

356
01:05:51,234 --> 01:05:53,304
I've been thinking about you.

357
01:05:54,274 --> 01:05:56,947
You've never really had any fun, have you?

358
01:05:58,034 --> 01:05:59,547
Never had a good time.

359
01:06:03,594 --> 01:06:05,585
You should go somewhere new.

360
01:06:06,594 --> 01:06:08,186
Go somewhere clean.

361
01:06:09,514 --> 01:06:11,027
Get a new start.

362
01:06:13,474 --> 01:06:15,112
You should go to....

363
01:06:26,474 --> 01:06:27,987
I go to America.

364
01:06:32,434 --> 01:06:35,346
I offer you a new life,
you choose an old dream.

365
01:07:04,233 --> 01:07:05,791
Sleep now.

366
01:07:12,353 --> 01:07:15,231
-Are you okay?
-I want my mother.

367
01:07:21,393 --> 01:07:22,712
I feel sick.

01:07:26,113 --> 01:07:28,388

01:07:31,473 --> 01:07:33,589
-Beach Boy.
-"Beach Boy."

371
01:07:47,233 --> 01:07:48,507
Tam is sick.

372
01:07:59,793 --> 01:08:01,226
Water sickness.

373
01:08:12,993 --> 01:08:14,551
You're stealing.

374
01:08:23,912 --> 01:08:25,584
They sick down there.

375
01:08:26,792 --> 01:08:28,225
But you're not.

376
01:11:09,190 --> 01:11:10,543
No more game!

377
01:11:13,670 --> 01:11:14,819
Play me.

378
01:11:16,430 --> 01:11:17,658
I no play.

379
01:11:21,470 --> 01:11:23,267
Play me. I start.

380
01:11:25,030 --> 01:11:26,668

01:11:27,470 --> 01:11:28,585

382
01:11:28,710 --> 01:11:29,984

01:11:31,470 --> 01:11:32,619

385
01:11:33,030 --> 01:11:34,702
What's that? You lose.

386
01:11:34,830 --> 01:11:36,309
Miami Dolphin football team.

387
01:11:36,430 --> 01:11:37,783
-You lie!
-No lie.

388
01:11:37,910 --> 01:11:39,104
Your turn!

389
01:11:41,430 --> 01:11:43,898
Highway 10. Huntington Beach.

390
01:11:44,310 --> 01:11:46,426
Polo sport shirt. Tide soap.

01:11:46,870 --> 01:11:50,829
Timex. Old Granddad. Cherokee. Minnesota.

392
01:11:51,230 --> 01:11:52,788
-Viceroy.
-Take the water.

393
01:11:52,910 --> 01:11:54,628
-What you hiding?
-Nothing.

394
01:11:54,750 --> 01:11:56,627
-You have food!
-Not true. Take the water.

395
01:11:56,750 --> 01:11:58,183
You have food!

396
01:12:46,629 --> 01:12:50,178
I'm Steve Yount. This is your news centre,
1010 WINS, New York...

397
01:12:50,309 --> 01:12:53,267
serving New York,
New Jersey and Connecticut.

398
01:13:16,749 --> 01:13:18,421
41, 42. Come on.

399
01:13:18,669 --> 01:13:20,660
43, 44.

400
01:13:54,188 --> 01:13:56,065
Go! Let's go!

401
01:15:03,268 --> 01:15:05,498
Come on. Let's go, let's go.

402
01:15:56,707 --> 01:15:58,345
Take them off, baby!

403
01:16:08,547 --> 01:16:11,823
Come on, baby, you got to sing it up
a little bit better than that.

404
01:16:11,947 --> 01:16:13,141
Sucky-sucky!

405
01:16:57,706 --> 01:17:01,176
...no, it's a Chinese dish.
Kung Pow chicken.

406
01:17:01,306 --> 01:17:03,217
Here comes the mortgage payment.

407
01:17:09,026 --> 01:17:10,744
Steady business.

408
01:17:12,706 --> 01:17:14,105
You see Ling?

409
01:17:14,226 --> 01:17:17,775
Ling? You know Ling. Busy, busy, busy.

410
01:17:24,226 --> 01:17:27,616
-What's that about?
-He's in love with Ling. The hooker.

411
01:17:28,706 --> 01:17:29,741
-He's kidding?
-No.

412
01:17:29,866 --> 01:17:32,539
It's a lost cause.
Hope he's got a lot of money.

413
01:17:43,026 --> 01:17:44,015
2:00.

414
01:17:46,946 --> 01:17:48,459
Time for you to leave.

415
01:18:05,906 --> 01:18:07,055
Good morning.

416
01:18:38,225 --> 01:18:39,374
Dear Mother...

417
01:18:40,945 --> 01:18:42,981
I have arrived at last in America.

418
01:18:43,905 --> 01:18:47,375
How can I tell you that I have arrived alone?

419
01:18:49,145 --> 01:18:53,138
Tam died of a fever.
He thought of you up to the end.

420
01:18:54,505 --> 01:18:58,134
I would give anything to have him alive.

421
01:18:59,865 --> 01:19:02,060
How could I fail my little Tam?

422
01:19:04,545 --> 01:19:06,297
I beg your forgiveness.

423
01:19:09,105 --> 01:19:11,061
How much stamp to Vietnam?

424
01:19:12,465 --> 01:19:14,899
Well, that depends what you have in there.

425
01:19:16,065 --> 01:19:18,181
Letter and cheque for transfer.

426
01:19:26,025 --> 01:19:27,219
70 cents.

427
01:20:00,544 --> 01:20:01,943
How're you doing?

428
01:20:11,704 --> 01:20:15,333
You send all your money to Vietnam,
you never get to Texas.

429
01:20:16,304 --> 01:20:17,862
She have nothing.

430
01:21:12,743 --> 01:21:13,698
No!

431
01:21:21,343 --> 01:21:23,061
Is this your brother?

432
01:21:32,543 --> 01:21:34,181
Here, delivery boy.

433
01:21:52,663 --> 01:21:54,016
What's wrong?

434
01:22:22,062 --> 01:22:24,701
-This is for you.
-Thank you.

435
01:23:22,702 --> 01:23:24,738
You like this guy, Jerry?

436
01:23:25,942 --> 01:23:27,091
He's not bad.

437
01:23:30,662 --> 01:23:33,574
You remember me? Remember Tam?

438
01:23:34,982 --> 01:23:38,770
Tam's dead. I'm alive. You're alive.

439
01:23:41,142 --> 01:23:42,541
I want a life.

440
01:23:44,862 --> 01:23:46,295
With this guy?

441
01:23:50,181 --> 01:23:52,695
-What's the word you say?
-Words? Oh!

442
01:23:52,821 --> 01:23:55,415
-Statistical.
-"Statistical."

443
01:23:55,541 --> 01:23:57,816
-What's the second one?
-Tachistoscopic.

444
01:24:00,581 --> 01:24:03,015
Ling told me about your brother.

445
01:24:03,421 --> 01:24:07,255
My condolences. I can't imagine
going through something like that.

446
01:24:12,421 --> 01:24:15,731
What was America to you?
Before you came here, I mean?

447
01:24:16,701 --> 01:24:18,453
My father is American.

448
01:24:21,221 --> 01:24:22,779
You like America?

449
01:24:24,781 --> 01:24:26,692
Something always going on.

450
01:24:27,101 --> 01:24:28,500
That's a good thing, right?

451
01:24:28,621 --> 01:24:31,419
Sure, it is. Always something going on.

452
01:24:36,101 --> 01:24:38,057
Have you seen him? Where is your father?

453
01:24:38,181 --> 01:24:39,853
-Texas.
-Texas.

454
01:24:40,181 --> 01:24:41,580
Yee-haw! Texas.

455
01:24:42,781 --> 01:24:44,055
Maybe dead.

456
01:24:48,501 --> 01:24:50,617
Well, you should try and find him.

457
01:24:50,741 --> 01:24:53,733
-Yeah, I was trying to help him to go--
-Be quiet.

458
01:24:54,501 --> 01:24:55,456
Okay?

459
01:25:11,580 --> 01:25:14,492
Wait! You wait, okay?

460
01:25:15,020 --> 01:25:18,615
For what? I cannot wait so long!

461
01:25:23,460 --> 01:25:27,214
You don't like what I am now?
I'm the same as I ever was.

462
01:25:49,220 --> 01:25:50,812
Time for you to go.

463
01:25:52,260 --> 01:25:53,659
Food get cold.

464
01:25:57,420 --> 01:25:59,217
He not so bad.

465
01:26:26,940 --> 01:26:30,615
-You're close to my heart.
-But you don't love me.

466
01:26:36,139 --> 01:26:37,492
I'm ugly, too.

467
01:26:51,899 --> 01:26:55,016
Greed, for lack of a better word, is good.

468
01:26:55,939 --> 01:26:58,817
Greed is right. Greed works.

469
01:26:59,899 --> 01:27:04,051
Greed clarifies,
cuts through and captures the essence...

470
01:27:04,659 --> 01:27:06,615
of the evolutionary spirit.

471
01:27:06,979 --> 01:27:08,128
I take two.

472
01:27:08,899 --> 01:27:11,811
Greed for life, for money, for love.

473
01:27:11,939 --> 01:27:13,213
Knowledge has....

474
01:27:13,339 --> 01:27:14,488
-I fold.
-Call.

475
01:27:23,779 --> 01:27:26,293
Three 10. I win.

476
01:27:27,739 --> 01:27:29,331
Why I always lose?

477
01:27:32,499 --> 01:27:33,932
Why you win so much?

478
01:27:34,059 --> 01:27:36,368
I told you. I learn gamble on boat.

479
01:27:37,219 --> 01:27:38,538
Long story.

480
01:27:39,899 --> 01:27:43,528
You Vietnamese. Why you no fly over?

481
01:27:45,019 --> 01:27:46,975
Idiot. Cost big money.

482
01:27:47,899 --> 01:27:50,049
-Your dad Gl, right?
-So?

483
01:27:50,939 --> 01:27:53,169
-Don't you know?
-What?

484
01:27:53,699 --> 01:27:57,658
Any Vietnamese with Gl dad
fly to America for free.

485
01:27:59,339 --> 01:28:01,090
Bullshit. Play.

486
01:28:03,578 --> 01:28:04,852
Is true.

487
01:28:07,578 --> 01:28:10,012
It's true. It's simple.

488
01:28:16,858 --> 01:28:17,973
You lie.

489
01:28:28,138 --> 01:28:29,287
You lie!

490
01:28:31,378 --> 01:28:32,413
You lie!

491
01:28:59,938 --> 01:29:02,133
Where the hell are you going? Hey!

492
01:29:02,258 --> 01:29:03,771
Where you going, man?

493
01:29:04,338 --> 01:29:07,410
Hey! You son of a.... You fucking....

494
01:29:19,338 --> 01:29:21,329
What the fuck you think you're doing?

495
01:29:21,458 --> 01:29:25,087
I American. US citizen. Can get passport.

496
01:29:25,217 --> 01:29:28,050
Can talk to lNS or FBl, ClA.

497
01:29:31,497 --> 01:29:33,010
Be like you.

498
01:29:33,937 --> 01:29:35,450
Congratulations.

499
01:30:25,737 --> 01:30:28,695
-What you looking at, boy?
-Your arm.

500
01:30:31,297 --> 01:30:34,767
-Bet you never seen one like that.
-Yes. I have.

501
01:30:46,737 --> 01:30:48,216
Where you from?

502
01:30:49,577 --> 01:30:50,770
Vietnam.

503
01:30:53,976 --> 01:30:55,489
You need a ride?

504
01:31:10,656 --> 01:31:12,453
Jesus! He's Chinese.

505
01:31:14,096 --> 01:31:16,087
I thought you were Mexican.

506
01:31:16,656 --> 01:31:18,965
Okay, what the hell. Hop in. Come on.

507
01:32:06,536 --> 01:32:08,572
This road take you right in.

508
01:32:10,056 --> 01:32:12,934
Houston's big. Be careful, okay?

509
01:32:13,576 --> 01:32:15,884
-Thank you.
-No problem. Good luck.

510
01:33:06,015 --> 01:33:07,004
Yes?

511
01:33:10,095 --> 01:33:12,689
-Do I know you?
-I sorry bother you.

512
01:33:12,815 --> 01:33:14,885
-Okay. Look, I'm not buying anything.
-No. I--

513
01:33:15,015 --> 01:33:17,848
And that includes religion.
So maybe you have the wrong address.

514
01:33:17,975 --> 01:33:19,727
I look for Steve Cole.

515
01:33:23,295 --> 01:33:25,172
I really can't help you.

516
01:33:25,295 --> 01:33:26,774
You know him?

517
01:33:28,255 --> 01:33:31,531
Let's just say I stopped knowing him
about 20 years ago.

518
01:34:09,334 --> 01:34:12,883
Look, I don't know where the hell Steve is
and I don't care.

519
01:34:13,534 --> 01:34:15,843
-I'm remarried. I have--
-You wife?

520
01:34:17,374 --> 01:34:19,888
So what if I am? Who the hell are you?

521
01:34:20,414 --> 01:34:22,291
I sorry. My name Binh.

522
01:34:22,414 --> 01:34:26,327
I tell you what, Ben,
if you're not off my property in 10 seconds...

523
01:34:26,454 --> 01:34:28,206
I'm calling the police.

524
01:34:42,334 --> 01:34:45,644
Hey, boy? Let's move along, boy.

525
01:34:46,894 --> 01:34:48,691
This not lady property.

526
01:34:52,574 --> 01:34:55,611
But you're still loitering. Go home.

527
01:35:03,134 --> 01:35:04,361
I walk now.

528
01:35:46,773 --> 01:35:49,924
-You want to know where Steve is?
-Yes.

529
01:35:51,453 --> 01:35:56,243
I don't really know, but the last time I heard,
he was in a little place called Sweetwater.

530
01:35:56,413 --> 01:35:58,973
-Sweetwater?
-Yeah.

531
01:36:00,253 --> 01:36:02,721
Ranch country. Or farm.

532
01:36:02,853 --> 01:36:05,321
You know, big skies?

533
01:36:09,693 --> 01:36:11,411
Will you go away now?

534
01:36:13,533 --> 01:36:17,003
Yes, I go now. No come back.

535
01:36:18,973 --> 01:36:20,201
Thank you.

536
01:36:26,373 --> 01:36:27,362
Ben?

537
01:36:31,132 --> 01:36:34,442
-What do you want with him, anyway?
-I am son.

538
01:36:43,212 --> 01:36:44,884
Well, isn't that something?

539
01:36:47,572 --> 01:36:49,403
Imagine Steve, a father.

540
01:36:50,732 --> 01:36:52,051
And husband.

541
01:36:55,292 --> 01:36:57,123
He married to my mother.

542
01:37:36,292 --> 01:37:38,362
Can I help you with something?

543
01:37:40,812 --> 01:37:42,643
-You owner?
-Yeah.

544
01:37:43,212 --> 01:37:44,725
You have workers?

545
01:37:48,412 --> 01:37:50,562
-You want to work here?
-Yes.

546
01:37:54,811 --> 01:37:58,121
-Why?
-I always want to be cowboy.

547
01:38:11,411 --> 01:38:13,083
Listen, no offence...

548
01:38:14,691 --> 01:38:17,205
but we don't get your kind here much.

549
01:38:17,691 --> 01:38:20,080
-You in trouble with the law?
-No.

550
01:38:25,091 --> 01:38:26,490
I hard worker.

551
01:38:27,691 --> 01:38:30,159
You need someone to fix fence, I fix.

552
01:38:33,571 --> 01:38:35,243
We've got a handyman.

553
01:38:37,531 --> 01:38:39,408
Only he isn't very handy.

554
01:38:42,291 --> 01:38:45,761
You get $2 an hour. And not a cent more.

555
01:38:51,851 --> 01:38:53,330
All right, then.

556
01:38:55,571 --> 01:38:58,244
-I'm Gene.
-Gene?

557
01:39:01,291 --> 01:39:02,440
Jesus!

558
01:39:03,651 --> 01:39:06,211
-lt never gets any easier.
-You fire him?

559
01:39:07,651 --> 01:39:09,369
I gotta let him go.

560
01:39:12,931 --> 01:39:14,284
Let him stay.

561
01:39:15,531 --> 01:39:18,090
I've only got one trailer for y'all.

562
01:39:20,170 --> 01:39:23,242
I don't mind. He can stay.

563
01:39:27,170 --> 01:39:29,968
Steve'll get you started. He's all right.

564
01:39:32,050 --> 01:39:34,803
It's his dog that might give you a problem.

565
01:41:16,929 --> 01:41:18,487
Gene, is that you?

566
01:41:27,489 --> 01:41:28,524
Gene?

567
01:41:32,249 --> 01:41:33,318
Hello.

568
01:41:34,609 --> 01:41:37,601
-Who are you?
-I Binh.

569
01:41:42,209 --> 01:41:43,722
I work here now.

570
01:41:53,209 --> 01:41:55,040
I thought you were Gene.

571
01:41:55,809 --> 01:41:58,721
Stella here
doesn't normally take to strangers.

572
01:42:05,289 --> 01:42:07,961
-ls he firing me?
-No.

573
01:42:08,408 --> 01:42:09,523
Why not?

574
01:42:14,288 --> 01:42:15,277
Why not?

575
01:42:19,368 --> 01:42:20,801
I tell him you stay.

576
01:43:08,128 --> 01:43:09,527
You take bed.

577
01:43:12,288 --> 01:43:13,437
You take bed.

578
01:44:02,567 --> 01:44:04,080
I hope you like toast.

579
01:44:10,767 --> 01:44:11,802
Thank you.

580
01:44:13,167 --> 01:44:15,397
I hope you like your eggs fried.

581
01:44:32,247 --> 01:44:33,919
You're great company.

582
01:44:36,287 --> 01:44:38,960
I not here to be your friend.

583
01:44:40,687 --> 01:44:42,120
You Vietnamese?

584
01:44:44,767 --> 01:44:46,166
How you know?

585
01:44:47,367 --> 01:44:49,119
I'm blind, not deaf.

586
01:44:54,887 --> 01:44:58,959
And if I'd known you were Vietnamese, l
wouldn't have wanted to be your roommate.

587
01:44:59,086 --> 01:45:01,680
Why? You have bad memory in Vietnam?

588
01:45:03,126 --> 01:45:04,115
Worse.

589
01:45:07,286 --> 01:45:09,038
I have good memories, Binh.

590
01:45:14,686 --> 01:45:15,801
Good memories.

591
01:45:19,526 --> 01:45:21,403
It's a beautiful country.

592
01:45:25,086 --> 01:45:27,919
I really think you'd rather have me scraping.

593
01:45:28,486 --> 01:45:29,714
I no paint.

594
01:45:32,366 --> 01:45:33,401
Wall.

595
01:45:35,846 --> 01:45:36,915
Paint.

596
01:45:50,126 --> 01:45:51,764
How long you blind?

597
01:45:55,886 --> 01:45:57,205
A lifetime.

598
01:46:01,606 --> 01:46:05,394
I worked in a storage facility in Saigon.

599
01:46:06,886 --> 01:46:09,195
I thought it was a crate of beer.

600
01:46:10,246 --> 01:46:12,282
Turned out to be explosives.

601
01:46:14,766 --> 01:46:18,202
-You still alive.
-That's what they said.

602
01:46:19,846 --> 01:46:24,600
One minute I'm in Saigon,
the next I'm in a hospital in Maryland...

603
01:46:25,325 --> 01:46:27,236
and six months had passed.

604
01:46:28,485 --> 01:46:32,956
I woke up, couldn't see.
Didn't know where I was.

605
01:46:35,005 --> 01:46:37,883
Some assholes tell me I'm lucky.

606
01:46:59,525 --> 01:47:00,753
Hey, Binh!

607
01:47:02,845 --> 01:47:05,279
-Binh!
-What?

608
01:47:06,965 --> 01:47:08,398
How am I doing?

609
01:47:48,644 --> 01:47:50,635
Who playing? Miami Dolphin?

610
01:47:52,164 --> 01:47:53,233
Oilers.

611
01:47:56,004 --> 01:47:57,562
You like noodles?

612
01:47:58,524 --> 01:48:00,594
-Soup noodles?
-Yeah. Pho.

613
01:48:01,204 --> 01:48:02,922
With real fish sauce.

614
01:48:03,684 --> 01:48:05,834
-Where'd you get that?
-Houston.

615
01:48:06,004 --> 01:48:08,040
More Vietnamese there than Saigon.

616
01:48:15,364 --> 01:48:17,594
I had a wife in Saigon.

617
01:48:23,684 --> 01:48:25,561
What happen to her?

618
01:48:26,364 --> 01:48:27,797
Never saw her again.

619
01:48:30,004 --> 01:48:33,838
It's like I told you, one minute I'm in Saigon,
and boom, I'm Stateside.

620
01:48:36,924 --> 01:48:40,041
So one day you were there,
and then you were gone...

621
01:48:41,284 --> 01:48:43,195
-just like that?
-Just like that.

622
01:48:45,124 --> 01:48:47,035
And then the war was over.

623
01:48:48,204 --> 01:48:49,796
Nobody could go back.

624
01:48:50,364 --> 01:48:51,797
Never saw her again.

625
01:48:52,844 --> 01:48:54,163
Simple as that.

626
01:49:03,484 --> 01:49:07,193
First time I saw my wife,
she was standing on a street corner...

627
01:49:07,324 --> 01:49:10,839
in a uniform, college uniform.

628
01:49:12,203 --> 01:49:14,922
Only I didn't know that's what it is.

629
01:49:15,803 --> 01:49:18,920
I just thought
it was one of your national costumes.

630
01:49:21,923 --> 01:49:23,436
But it was white.

631
01:49:24,963 --> 01:49:27,158
It had high slits up the side.

632
01:49:30,243 --> 01:49:33,201
I'd never seen
someone so beautiful before...

633
01:49:35,203 --> 01:49:36,921
in all that ugliness.

634
01:49:40,963 --> 01:49:44,956
Then she rode away on her bicycle
and I thought I'd never seen her again.

635
01:49:46,003 --> 01:49:50,360
But I found she worked after school
in her uncle's barbershop.

636
01:49:54,923 --> 01:49:57,596
She was a terrible barber.

637
01:50:16,323 --> 01:50:18,200
-Big feet.
-Dirty, too.

638
01:50:20,923 --> 01:50:22,276
We had a boy.

639
01:50:24,923 --> 01:50:26,515
He was just a baby.

640
01:50:27,723 --> 01:50:31,318
He had the eyes of an old man,
even at two months.

641
01:50:34,563 --> 01:50:36,917
Or maybe they all droop, we didn't know.

642
01:50:37,122 --> 01:50:38,760
Why you no go back?

643
01:50:39,882 --> 01:50:41,031
Go back?

644
01:50:41,722 --> 01:50:43,440
See the old sights?

645
01:50:45,962 --> 01:50:48,920
No, I left her to take care of the child alone.

646
01:50:52,362 --> 01:50:55,638
I didn't think that she needed a blind man
to look after.

647
01:52:19,561 --> 01:52:22,314
My mother is very beautiful...

648
01:52:23,601 --> 01:52:27,150
Iike crane flying at sunset.

649
01:52:36,761 --> 01:52:38,513
Binh, why are you here?

650
01:52:40,361 --> 01:52:42,829
-This place?
-No, America.

651
01:52:44,761 --> 01:52:46,353
America beautiful.

652
01:52:47,801 --> 01:52:49,075
How's that?

653
01:52:57,281 --> 01:53:00,432
-Did you come by boat?
-Yes.

654
01:53:03,681 --> 01:53:06,753
-Hard?
-Not so hard.

655
01:53:10,881 --> 01:53:13,759
Yes, cranes flying at sunset.

656
01:53:38,120 --> 01:53:40,236
-Just a trim, Binh.
-Yes.

657
01:53:47,240 --> 01:53:51,438
-What do they call those sticky sweet cakes?
-There a lot of sticky sweet cake.

658
01:53:52,760 --> 01:53:56,799
-I think they're made out of rice.
-They all made of rice.

659
01:54:00,560 --> 01:54:02,710
-Can you make them?
-Yes.

660
01:54:04,280 --> 01:54:06,350
I'll cut your hair next time.

661
01:54:07,280 --> 01:54:08,269
Yes.
