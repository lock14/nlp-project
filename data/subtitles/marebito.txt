MAREBITO
The Stranger from Afar
I'm certain
that he's a substance abuser.
Or is it a woman?
Living in a small apartment,
with her paranoia.
Her paranoia is of little interest to me.
But I can say this:
By looking at her through the lens,
I believe that I've salvaged her soul.
A tragedy occurred
at a subway station.
Shot by freelance cameraman,
Takuyoshi Masuoka,
who happened to be at the scene
of a bizarre suicide earlier today.
He captured the scene
in close proximity.
Don't do it. Calm down.
Keep out of here!
Let go of the knife!
Calm down!
Arei Kuroki
was without a steady income,
just like me.
He was paying no attention
to anybody at the site.
He was too terrified to notice them.
Did he stab himself in the eye
to avoid seeing
what terrified him?
I want to see
what he saw then.
Among the images I'd captured
there were strange images
that looked like ghosts or UFOs.
Things both strange and mysterious.
But they mean nothing to me,
probably because
these things have already
been defined as strange.
Seeing these images
makes the viewer feel anxious,
unlike the look of absolute fear
on that man's face
as he killed himself.
Even if this is really
a person actually dying,
the terror on her face
doesn't seem quite real.
If the ultimate terror
is to have your own mind
and body destroyed by others.
I'd go so far as
to imitate a psychopath
to record the terror
of the victim on my retina
and video tape.
I did not feel
that sense of terror at all.
What is she looking at?
What was he watching
that was so terrifying?
The answer was underground...
I quit taking the Prozac
to control my serotonin level.
I have to stay focused.
Otherwise I won't see
what I'm dying to see.
They weren't terrified
to see whatever they saw.
They saw something
because they were terrified.
I had it all wrong.
I was with a documentary TV crew
on that day.
We were on our way back from a shoot.
Now I'm back at the scene,
and I realize that the image on the TV
is more realistic.
What did Kuroki see?
Do I have the courage
to open the door to the passageway of terror?
Can I face terror
from which the only escape
is to kill myself?
Fear of the unknown
compels me to open the door.
These stairs were built
not so long ago.
Beneath Tokyo
lay hidden tunnels
and passageways.
It's a well-known urban myth.
But obviously
it's not just a myth.
The underground development
was a reminder of the Second World War.
This must be one such war time memorabilia.
Stay away!
Sorry to bother you.
Homeless people usually stay
in populated areas.
But not this one.
He rejects society completely.
Why is he so alarmed?
What's he scared of?
It's so safe down here...
Safe?
It's not safe at all.
W-Why not?
Because of the Deros.
Deros?
If they find you...
they'll suck your blood dry.
He is definitely haunted by terror.
The underground development of Tokyo
was not just from the Second World War.
It must have been done
throughout history.
Connecting new tunnels
with old ones.
Who's beyond the wall?
Who hides behind it'?
I've crossed the boundary
to the netherworld alive.
It must mean that I'm sufficiently terrified.
I've been invited here.
Invited by who?... And why?
I'm too exhausted to think straight.
I'm not sure if I can make
logical conclusions.
I haven't seen you around.
Are you new here?
This must be the netherworld.
Many think that beneath the earth
is the netherworld.
It's because they don't know
what's underneath.
It's widely conceived
as the world beyond.
Mr. Kuroki,
you're a talkative ghost, aren't you?
Do you think I'm really a ghost?
My name is actually Kuroki.
Have we met?
No.
You haven't seen me before
but I've seen you.
I saw you through
the videocamera's viewfinder.
You are different from those
who come here to escape.
I just saw one of them.
I saw him back there.
But I don't think I'm all that
different from these people.
I didn't know that Tokyo had
such a developed
subterranean complex.
It's not just Tokyo.
Populated places all over the world
all have access
to the underground world.
Are you referring
to the Hollow Earth Theory?
As you know,
there are two versions
of the theory.
One version is that the earth
is hollow, like an eggshell.
Another view is that there is
a complex subterranean system.
I'm short of evidence
to support the former version.
The latter seems true,
as we stand in that very complex.
Entrances to the subterranean world
do exist in South America.
It's a well-known fact
that underneath Brussels
lays a subterranean city.
Below the Patala shrine in Tibet
there's a utopia called Shamballa,
a very well-accepted idea.
And Agartha is its capital...
It's history as foreseen
by Madame Blavatsky.
By the way, the under dweller
I stumbled upon earlier--
he was very afraid of the Deros.
It's short for
"detrimental robots".
They are indeed dangerous.
They can hardly see
but, like dogs, they hear well.
You'd better be careful.
I'm beginning to remember...
Is it the creature
described by Richard Shaver
in the fantasy book
he wrote in the 20s'?
It was a book of fiction,
until the book turned out
to be a prophecy.
Then fiction was no longer fiction.
I see.
You're saying that
the Shaver Mystery
was fictional when it was written.
Now it's recognized as the truth
as well as the hollow earth theory.
You're a quick learner.
Wait a minute.
I understand nothing yet.
I want to know
what was so terrifying
when you died.
The horror I saw on your face...
I came here wanting to find that out.
So you're saying that I'm dead.
I lost my life
before I reached Agartha.
If I really died in front of you,
you shouldn't be with me like this.
Wait...
It doesn't matter
if I have lost my mind.
But I want to stay sane enough
to recognize the terror.
The Mountains Of Madness.
There must be ancient ruins
down in the ravines.
This is not the creation of man
but of the under dwellers.
I know I'm not
the only living being here.
I can feel it.
Sorry to have kept you waiting.
I'm Mori.
Isn't it hot in here?
So, Mr. Masuoka,
are you a trained news cameraman?
Not just that, but my last company
was affiliated with the news.
We do industrial videos, too.
Sometimes even TV dramas.
Anything goes.
We can register you as camera crew.
When we have a production,
we'll put you down for it.
- That's fine.
- Deal, then.
Here's the one.
The main feature
is the "movie mode,"
a video telecast function.
Do you have a pet, by any chance?
You can check how your cat's doing
from wherever you are.
Great image quality.
We only have one left.
Would you like to buy it?
Thank you very much.
I decided to tentatively call her "F."
Not that I actually call her
by that name.
My little Kaspar Hauser.
I don't know how old she is
but obviously
this is the first time
for her to meet a human.
I wipe her once a day
and that's all I can do for her.
F doesn't eat
nor drink anything.
She's only awake
for three hours or so.
This is Atsuko Ono in Shinjuku.
I'll show you the latest fashion trends,
so check them out.
Let's see what I can find...
Any young couples?
Let's have a look.
Over there!
Excuse me.
Want to be on TV?
Stop the camera!
They don't look like they're in love.
Lose this thing!
Sorry.
We're moving.
The next location...
It's right over there.
A new boutique in the mall.
Not again!
Just a little interview.
MA-SU-O-KA
TA-KU-YO-SHI
Maybe her vocal cords are impaired
from being inactive.
She came from a world
where vocalizing was unnecessary.
How old is your daughter?
No, she's not my daughter...
Is this a gift then?
How tall is she'?
150? Maybe 160 cm...
In that case...
How about this?
This is so pretty.
It's popular now.
This one will look great on her.
I think I want something plain.
Plain?
Who's F talking to?
What's wrong?
What happened?
Hey?
What's wrong?
You should have drunk
what I gave you!
12 seconds.
What happened
in those 12 seconds?
Hello.
Who is this?
Who I am is irrelevant
to the problem that you have.
You have the wrong number.
I'm not--
I have the right number,
Mr. Masuoka.
You're in serious trouble.
Do you realize that?
What are you talking about?
There's someone there
who shouldn't be.
She can't survive there.
Do you understand me?
You think that you're saving her life,
but you're actually
killing her.
What can I do?
She eats nothing, drinks nothing!
Tell me what I'm supposed to do!
FROM PUBLIC PAY PHONE
Should I just
observe F as she weakens?
What do I expect from her?
Even if she could be taught
to behave like a human,
what would she gain from that?
What are you recording?
Nothing.
You were recording me.
I saw you.
It was turned off.
I don't like it.
Give me the tape.
What's the matter?
Did you do something wrong?
Okay, wise-ass. Give it up!
Hand it over.
Give it to me!
Hello. I'm back.
Were you sleeping all day again?
It's nothing.
I slipped.
I liked it.
I wanted to keep feeding her
until she's totally satisfied.
Of course
what it means is my own death.
I don't care if I died but...
what would happen to her if I died?
She didn't complain much
about animal blood,
but nothing made her content
like human blood.
I gave up
treating her like a human.
I treat her like an animal,
like a pet.
That's all she should be for me.
That's all I should care for her.
Recently she has begun
to behave like a human.
That's probably
just her imitating me.
What is... F anyway?
Why does she only feed on blood?
My speculation is that,
from the day of her birth...
she was raised on blood
instead of breast milk.
No human would have done it.
It must be someone from underground.
Perhaps I can assume that
the Deros brought her up.
Hey...
Did you hurt yourself?
Who are you?
What's wrong with you?
Listen to me.
Who are you?
Are you joking?
Fuyumi is missing.
I told the police already.
- But I...
- Fuyumi?
Is she with you now?
I don't know any Fuyumi.
I'm innocent.
Don't know her?
She's your daughter.
I don't have a daughter!
Madness is contagious.
Recently I attract madness.
I wonder why...
If she left my apartment of her own will,
she's not so far away.
She can hardly walk.
But--
But if somebody took her away...
I'm not giving up, F.
I found her.
I want her back.
Please tell me,
has she gone back
to the subterranean ruins?
So you failed, didn't you?
I had a little hope
that you might be the one
who could tame her.
What did she eat
when she was away?
I don't have any idea.
But one thing is clear.
She needs nutritious food desperately.
Don't walk away!
You have to listen to me.
You owe me an explanation.
Are you going to ignore me forever?
I'm going to make you talk today.
Stop pretending that you know nothing!
Hey!
Stop treating me like shit!
Stop!
I know you can hear me!
I know Fuyumi's with you.
I want to see her.
I know you're hiding her.
So stop pretending!
Say something.
I have a right to see my girl.
Do you always take
that video camera with you?
You're a pervert, right?
You have to make me look pretty.
Never tell the school about this.
I'm dead meat if they found out.
Are you going to sell this?
- Give me 50,000, then.
- 50,000 yen is enough?
I should have made it 100,000.
What are you drinking?
Are you hungry?
It's low-cal diet food.
I have a hungry girl
back at home, too.
So? Are we going to have
the interview here?
I lost my virginity...
When was that?
Was it yesterday
or was it the day before that?
Over there?
Are you serious?
I don't think so.
There are better places than this.
What are you?
Throat fetish?
Anybody in fear is beautiful.
But if it's fear of death,
it's mediocre.
I don't recognize myself any more.
CALL FROM PUBLIC PAY PHONE
Hello?
F is content now.
Because I made her content.
You should have nothing
to complain about now.
No complaints.
You're right.
Roll camera, Masuoka.
- Are you ready, Tanaka?
- Yes.
Action in five seconds, four, three, two...
Reporting from the murder site.
A high school girl was found dead
at a public toilet not long ago.
No sign of theft,
her personal belongings
were found intact.
The police has been examining
the site for further evidence.
The victim has not been
identified yet.
We'll give you updates
as information comes through.
Good, out! Okay.
Masuoka, we're done here.
Masuoka!
I think humans are a degenerated species.
I believe that our ancestors
were more perceptive than us.
They could see creatures
from a different dimension...
sneaking into our dimension.
The creatures...
The strangers...
Come on, let's go.
That's enough.
You've had enough.
I took a train
without deciding on a destination.
I don't remember
how long I've been here.
I might as well find a job
in the village...
and work until the day I die.
Maybe that's how my life should be.
Do you want to come home?
Home?
We have come from the depths
of the ocean.
Have you forgotten that?
No, I haven't.
Crawling under
tremendous water pressure...
our people used to be
so much wiser then.
What did you see?
When you poked your eye out
in the subway tunnel...
you looked as if you'd seen
something most terrifying.
Yes.
That's right.
I don't know why,
but I long for your terror.
I long to experience
the terror that you'd felt.
That's because it's something unknown.
The feeling we know as terror
is actually ancient wisdom
that's sealed in our subconscious mind.
So I wasn't really mad.
It was just a pretense.
I longed to be mad.
I just hoped to be so mad
that I could someday
witness the terror.
As a result, I killed my wife...
and treated my daughter
like an animal.
I even killed somebody unrelated.
All of that was not enough
to drive me truly insane.
That's how degenerated I am.
A Dero?
The creature still exists
in my apartment.
Looks like she's hibernating...
You...
came back to me.
From now on I'll never speak...
because I need no human words now.
