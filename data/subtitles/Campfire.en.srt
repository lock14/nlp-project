{1400}{1466}Tammy, open the door.|Tell them Dad's not home.
{1531}{1601}They're here to buy the car,|they don't need to know I'm a widow.
{1606}{1690}Tell them your father's not home,|but your Mom is. It's okay, go on.
{1715}{1787}Esty can go.|- I won't be part of this.
{2145}{2200}Hi, we're here about the Peugeot.
{2228}{2292}My father's not home.|- When is he due back?
{2321}{2342}I don't know.
{2357}{2437}It's about the car? Good,|come on in, I'll get the keys.
{2442}{2495}My husband just stepped out.|- We don't want to disturb...
{2500}{2546}I'll bring the papers.|- We work nearby.
{2550}{2642}We'll come back when your husband's|at home. Have a nice day.
{2655}{2680}See you.
{2731}{2834}{Y:i}My father died of cancer a year|ago, two weeks before Lag B'Omer.
{2848}{2897}{Y:i}I was 15 at the time.
{2912}{2959}{Y:i}This week|the year of mourning ended
{2963}{3016}{Y:i}and Mom finally decided|to sell Dad's car.
{3020}{3107}{Y:i}It's been sitting in the same spot|since Dad last parked it there.
{3118}{3217}{Y:i}Since these are hard times for the|people of Israel, Mom also decided
{3221}{3298}{Y:i}to join the founding group of|a new settlement in the West Bank.
{3305}{3401}{Y:i}But first she has to pass Motke|Kupfer's acceptance committee.
{3423}{3461}{Y:i}This is Motke.
{3465}{3522}{Y:i}He likes to have his picture taken|with important people.
{3554}{3597}{Y:i}Mom always says that Motke
{3601}{3670}{Y:i}is one of the most influential|people in Religious Zionism.
{3676}{3745}{Y:i}But I think that my father|didn't like him much.
{3783}{3846}{Y:i}Shula, his wife,|is a good friend of my mother's
{3852}{3936}{Y:i}and Ya'ir, their youngest son,|is in my youth group.
{3962}{4031}{Y:i}Even the Minister of Interior|came to his Bar Mitzva.
{4045}{4104}Okay, tell us what you do.
{4110}{4188}I'm a construction engineer,|I work for a building company.
{4192}{4259}I'm an insurance agent.|- I'm a lawyer in a Tel-Aviv office.
{4263}{4361}I'm a special-ed teacher. - I'm an|English teacher for 5th graders.
{4368}{4413}Tell him what you do in the army.
{4444}{4532}In reserve duty,|I'm a battalion commander.
{4538}{4637}I think that these days we|should all take the initiative
{4641}{4709}and strengthen these settlements.
{4713}{4750}We feel that this|is the need of the hour.
{4754}{4847}And quality of life for the kids.|We couldn't afford that in the city.
{4851}{4935}It's really important to us,|to have a house with a lawn...
{4939}{5001}We couldn't afford that in the city.|- Yes, of course.
{5005}{5057}But that's not the main reason...
{5061}{5100}If you were on|the acceptance committee,
{5105}{5174}what kind of people would you pick|as your neighbors?
{5200}{5238}People like us, I think.
{5242}{5270}People like us.
{5274}{5302}Mainly people like us.
{5326}{5360}People like you.
{5397}{5481}You know, establishing a settlement|isn't just having meetings.
{5497}{5579}It's also hard physical work.|Are you sure you can handle it?
{5598}{5647}Alone?|- I'm not alone.
{5690}{5747}I won't lie to you. The number|of trailers we have is limited.
{5751}{5797}And if you move into one of them...
{5802}{5873}it means one less man|for guard duty,
{5880}{5930}one less for the prayer quorum.
{5934}{5966}It's something I need to consider.
{5970}{6046}I can't complete a quorum,|but I can do guard duty.
{6050}{6100}I see no problem here.
{6122}{6201}Okay, Rachel. Let us think about it|and get back to you.
{6213}{6250}Keep up the good work!
{6290}{6343}I'd just like to tell you
{6347}{6430}that being a part of this settlement|is very important to me.
{6457}{6515}You don't need another guard.
{6527}{6576}You need someone|who believes in the cause.
{6580}{6630}Someone strong enough|to withstand the difficulties,
{6634}{6731}and I have that strength more than|most of the people you know here.
{6780}{6821}This is my dream.
{6937}{7003}His name is Yossi Moraly.|The sweetest man, a bachelor.
{7007}{7081}If it's okay, I'll give him|your number. He'll call you.
{7111}{7167}Say yes, Rachel.|What's there to lose?
{7171}{7210}I've been planning this|for a year now.
{7215}{7260}It will also help them see|that you're serious.
{7264}{7315}I'm very serious. That's why|I said what I did earlier.
{7319}{7367}I just hope they understood me.
{7377}{7440}So you agree?|Can I give him your number?
{7512}{7557}All right.|What did you say his name was?
{7561}{7603}Yossi.|Yossi Moraly.
{7614}{7666}Why do you have to beg them?
{7683}{7747}If they want you, they'll say so.|And if they don't,
{7751}{7790}there's nothing for you there|anyway.
{7794}{7845}What do you mean, "if they don't|want us?" They don't.
{7849}{7884}Didn't you see how they treated us?
{7888}{7931}As though we were lepers|or something.
{7935}{7999}Anyway I'm not moving to that place.|There's nothing for me there.
{8003}{8068}So where do you intend to live?|I'm renting out the apartment.
{8072}{8143}If you rent it, I'll live on the|street and become a prostitute.
{8147}{8207}You'll have one daughter a settler|and another daughter a hooker.
{8211}{8264}What will you do?|Drag me there by force?
{8268}{8336}I don't want to live in that|settlement with your friends.
{8368}{8440}{Y:i}And I decided that at all costs,|no matter what,
{8456}{8501}{Y:i}this year I'll be happy.
{8725}{8788}Ignore them.|- Tammy Gerlick!
{8793}{8838}What's up?
{8857}{8935}Tammy Gerlick, what's up?|Got your period today?
{8943}{8996}Do you know them?|- They're in my youth group.
{9000}{9043}Tammy Gerlick!
{9075}{9149}Can I help you? - Yes.|You can behave like a human being.
{9153}{9185}What's that?
{9189}{9234}Go on, turn around!|Why d'you stop?
{9238}{9285}Watch your mouth. You don't|know who you're dealing with!
{9289}{9351}You're right, absolutely right.|We're sorry.
{9525}{9590}In my time we didn't have|people like that in Bnei Akiva.
{9596}{9633}He's cute...
{9713}{9739}Hello.
{9794}{9846}Just a moment, I'm not sure.|I'll see.
{9858}{9925}Dad, it's for you!|About the car!
{9951}{9979}Dad!
{10049}{10126}Mom, is Dad home?|It's about the car.
{10200}{10226}Dad!
{10230}{10286}Would you stop that already?|It's not funny anymore.
{11057}{11087}Hello.
{11119}{11173}Hello.|I'm Yossi.
{11180}{11232}Rachel.|Nice to meet you.
{11265}{11334}Are you hungry? 'Cause I haven't|eaten all day. - Very hungry.
{12180}{12213}Here.|Sit here.
{12347}{12390}Everything okay?
{12723}{12762}Everything okay?
{12787}{12866}I can turn on the heating.|- No thanks, I'm fine.
{12881}{12927}How do you know...|- I can...
{12934}{12996}Sorry. - No, no. Go ahead.|What were you saying?
{13000}{13077}No, I just wanted to ask|how you know Motke and Shula.
{13081}{13123}I heard you were good friends.
{13127}{13187}Motke and I were in yeshiva|together.
{13210}{13269}And I knew Shula even before that.
{13277}{13347}She's been trying to marry me off|for twenty years now.
{13379}{13498}{Y:i}Electricity flows from your hands|Love me gently
{13536}{13681}{Y:i}Love me with your hands,|Slowly, desperately
{13771}{13843}{Y:i}Cheek, neck, shoulder...
{13848}{14004}{Y:i}Love me with your hands,|slowly...
{14068}{14158}I'll have the sweet and sour|chicken, please. - Same for me.
{14348}{14401}She says you could order|something else
{14405}{14453}and she'll put it in the middle.|- No.
{14457}{14526}Chicken is fine.|Let her bring chicken. Excellent.
{14530}{14590}But she should bring us bread,|for the blessing.
{14594}{14659}I don't think they have bread|in a Chinese restaurant.
{14844}{14909}Eggroll, bring eggrolls.|Eggrolls are good.
{14913}{14984}She should bring eggrolls.|I've tried them, they're delicious.
{15271}{15337}Nice place, isn't it?|- Yes.
{16666}{16712}Did we disturb you?
{16722}{16751}No.
{18148}{18218}Well, what do you think?|- About what?
{18224}{18280}Think you'll want to see me again?
{18341}{18392}It's okay,|you can say no.
{18415}{18467}I know we're not right|for each other.
{18490}{18581}But I enjoyed tonight anyway.|I enjoyed meeting you. Really.
{18610}{18642}Thank you.
{18666}{18746}Am I your first date|since your husband died?
{18797}{18847}So how was it?|Okay?
{18878}{18945}I think so. I don't know.|You tell me.
{18972}{19038}I've been on much worse dates.|- Worse than this?
{19042}{19081}Believe me.
{19092}{19186}Once I was fixed up with a woman,|on a blind date, just like this,
{19193}{19241}and when I came to pick her up|it turned out
{19245}{19304}we'd already been fixed up|a few years before.
{19330}{19381}What, you didn't remember her name?|- No.
{19385}{19464}Neither did she.|How can you remember so many names?
{19468}{19548}Why, how many dates are we talking|about? How many women did you meet?
{19556}{19586}Hundreds.
{19619}{19650}But I stopped all that.
{19654}{19712}In the last two years|I stopped saying yes.
{19726}{19745}Why?
{19757}{19804}It wasn't working.
{19808}{19838}I felt bad.
{19842}{19894}I felt people had given up on me.
{19909}{19966}Truth is,|I pretty much gave up on myself.
{19970}{20047}And tonight? - You know Shula.|She's really pushy.
{20058}{20100}I thought she'd|already given up on me,
{20104}{20187}but then she came up with this idea|that I have to meet you...
{20195}{20249}So I felt awkward.|I agreed.
{20255}{20290}And that's it.
{20309}{20353}And you're terrific.
{20431}{20488}Okay, let's take you home.
{20802}{20877}MiniYossi Bus Service -
{21060}{21112}The best of luck to you, Rachel.
{21140}{21215}Just don't despair, everything|will be okay, I'm telling you.
{21256}{21345}And if you ever need a ride|anywhere, call me.
{21373}{21443}Okay, thanks.|- Good night. - Good night.
{24512}{24575}Esty, be careful not to walk|barefoot here now.
{24580}{24608}What?
{24856}{24904}What are you doing?
{24917}{24976}No one locks doors in my house.
{24982}{25034}You want privacy?|Get married.
{25092}{25138}Tammy, be careful|not to walk barefoot here.
{25142}{25173}Are you out of your mind?
{25177}{25246}You're a total psycho! What's wrong|with you? You should be committed.
{25250}{25308}I swear, I'll call the police!
{25312}{25370}Tammy. Bring me the garbage-can.|- Does this seem normal to you?
{25374}{25418}Why are you helping this madwoman?
{25422}{25487}Think I care?|I'll show you privacy!
{25623}{25708}Help! There's a crazy woman here!|Someone call the police!
{25712}{25744}Help!
{25750}{25808}If you don't come inside,|I'll smash your guitar.
{25812}{25885}If you touch my guitar, I'll take|off my clothes for everyone to see!
{25889}{25965}We'll see what they think of that|at the acceptance committee.
{26143}{26172}Hello.
{26241}{26316}My Dad's in army reserve duty.|Call back in a month.
{26469}{26514}We've decided to accept you|to the founding group.
{26518}{26550}But for a trial period.
{26560}{26621}I'm very sorry, Rachel,|but you have to understand.
{26625}{26690}A settlement is like a|delicate plant. A tiny plant.
{26714}{26778}Too much wind, too much rain,|and the plant dies.
{26792}{26881}So before I put it in the ground,|I have to make sure
{26885}{26991}it's strong, that all|the elements are at their best.
{27011}{27074}Let me get this straight.|Am I in, or not?
{27108}{27166}Before we move to the site,|we'll have a vote.
{27170}{27222}Are there any other people|on a trial period?
{27244}{27266}No.
{27272}{27361}Don't worry, I'm sure they'll accept|you in the end. Not to worry.
{27420}{27463}Did you talk to Yossi?
{27467}{27524}I understand|you're not interested.
{27532}{27614}Still, I wanted to thank you.|I'm glad I did it.
{27620}{27659}I'm glad too.
{27664}{27747}Remember, this is a second marriage.|Don't expect any fireworks.
{27751}{27812}You have to get it into your head|that you're looking for...
{27825}{27886}I don't know, a good friend|who'll keep you company.
{27890}{27980}He doesn't need to be a knight in shinin|armor. He just needs to be a "mensch."
{28028}{28098}Look,|I have someone else for you,
{28109}{28150}but I don't want to bother him|for nothing.
{28154}{28215}Maybe you're not ready yet.|- I'm ready.
{28220}{28262}His name is Moshe Weinstock,|he's divorced.
{28266}{28316}Motke knows him from the army,|he was an army cantor.
{28320}{28365}He's a very impressive,|very wealthy man.
{28369}{28431}He gets invited from all over|the world to lead the prayers.
{28446}{28492}Do you know him?|- No.
{28496}{28577}But I think Shmuel once|went to see him sing at a concert.
{28604}{28666}So are you interested?|- I think so. I...
{28670}{28719}Good, I'll talk to him.
{28725}{28776}But Rachel, I have to know|that you're serious.
{28780}{28854}He's not someone to play games|with. He's no MiniYossi.
{28870}{28911}Okay.|I get it.
{28975}{29042}It stings a little, but don't worry.
{29071}{29131}You have to keep it on|for ten minutes.
{29211}{29270}Careful you don't eat it...
{29292}{29323}You do that all your life?
{29327}{29389}You wish! Soon you'll start|growing a beard too.
{29393}{29480}But don't get upset. It's well-known|that hairy women are smarter.
{29492}{29556}I'd rather be stupid|but not have a beard.
{29565}{29605}At least you got Dad's coloring.
{29609}{29679}Imagine what it's like to have|a mustache like mine and Mom's.
{30067}{30128}Enough already.|Make up.
{30181}{30235}Know why Dad died quickly?
{30254}{30344}The doctors said some people|live for years with his illness.
{30362}{30448}He knew Mom didn't have|the patience to take care of him.
{30469}{30499}Tammy!
{30532}{30571}Tammy, come to eat.
{30812}{30887}{Y:i}I know you don't like to hear|Zionist talk.
{30894}{30974}{Y:i}But still,|here are just a few clean words.
{30978}{31048}{Y:i}We're setting out on a mission|thousands of kilometers from here
{31052}{31099}{Y:i}in order to save Israelis.
{31109}{31194}{Y:i}Just because they're Israelis.|And Jews.
{31217}{31313}{Y:i}And if we don't do it,|no one else will do it for us.
{31347}{31423}{Y:i}This is a long and complicated|operation
{31429}{31469}{Y:i}and I want to emphasize
{31473}{31532}{Y:i}that the success or failure|of the mission
{31547}{31631}{Y:i}depends on us alone.|Good luck.
{32528}{32575}{Y:i}Blessed be the True Judge.
{32642}{32675}{Y:i}Yoni is dead.
{33277}{33375}Goslan, you nut! Don't you dare|show your face here again!
{34915}{34961}Rachel?|- Yes. Moshe?
{34966}{35039}Moshe. Moshe Weinstock.|Hello. Nice to meet you.
{35081}{35139}I hope you didn't wait long?|- No.
{35182}{35242}Nice hotel, no?|I like it a lot.
{35246}{35352}Exclusive.|But not too fancy-shmancy.
{35391}{35474}They have a cake here.|A cheesecake. Unbelievable.
{35478}{35542}I'm not just saying that.|It's world-class.
{35562}{35607}You have to taste it.
{35629}{35717}Do you come here often?|- You might say they know me here.
{35738}{35810}Shula tells me you're a cantor.|- Cantor...
{35830}{35921}I just lead the prayers once in|a while. No need to exaggerate.
{35974}{36095}{Y:i}Kol Nidrei...
{36103}{36175}This is my favorite part.|It's my father's melody.
{36507}{36560}Come on, what are you afraid of?
{36564}{36622}I'm not getting into trouble|with your mother.
{36626}{36668}There's no one here.|- Are you out of your mind?
{36672}{36741}I'm not going into that room.|Think I'm crazy?
{36789}{36871}What's the matter? Come on.|- Come downstairs.
{36877}{36936}I don't want to go downstairs.|Who cares about the door?
{36940}{37008}Stop it, Esty.|I'm not kidding. I'm leaving.
{37016}{37062}Okay then, leave.
{37068}{37118}Don't be crazy.|We can't be here with that door.
{37122}{37162}Your mother's due back any minute.
{37179}{37251}Okay. No one's forcing you|to stay here. Go.
{37296}{37365}I swear, you're even crazier|than your mother.
{37736}{37776}Are you nuts? Blowing up|bullets here in the Center?
{37780}{37844}But what a cool explosion!|- He'll kick you out.
{37904}{37981}What's the matter, Tammy Gerlick?|Too snotty to say hi?
{37996}{38040}What, we don't exist?
{38044}{38100}If you'd say hi,|I'd answer you.
{38124}{38199}Okay, but why did you stop?|Keep going. Get lost!
{38203}{38255}Hey, you moron!|Forget about him, Tammy.
{38259}{38295}He's a psycho.|You can stay.
{38299}{38348}Why is she staring at us?|- Why are you chasing her away?
{38352}{38389}I feel like it.|- Great.
{38393}{38453}It's okay.|I have to go anyway.
{38556}{38663}Tammy Gerlick, is it true|that you put out? Tammy Gerlick.
{38668}{38708}Tammy Gerlick!
{38735}{38782}Stop it.|Shut up already.
{38871}{38909}Wait a minute, Tammy.
{38957}{38981}Hi.
{39038}{39110}I just wanted to tell you|not to be offended by what happened.
{39114}{39168}That Goslan guy is insane.
{39176}{39242}It's okay.|But thanks.
{39314}{39361}Who's the soldier|who was with you the other day?
{39365}{39417}Who, llan?|- He's just Yaniv's brother.
{39423}{39506}He doesn't have any friends his age,|so he hangs out with us.
{39691}{39743}I hope that's not yours.
{39753}{39791}Actually, it is.
{39849}{39896}It's okay, you can sit.
{39900}{39948}No one's touched it for a year.
{39952}{40007}I bet the battery's dead.
{40024}{40102}You know about cars?|- A little. Why?
{41008}{41056}Nothing.|The battery's dead.
{41060}{41106}Not just the battery...
{41219}{41264}Is this weird for you?
{41297}{41353}Why didn't you want us to visit you|while you were mourning?
{41357}{41396}Who said I didn't want you to?
{41400}{41437}That's what they said.
{41444}{41496}Ya'ir and Ayala would come to|the Center, huddle-up in a corner,
{41501}{41579}and then they'd choose the|delegation to comfort you.
{41585}{41681}Whoever wasn't chosen would stay|at the meeting with all the geeks.
{41726}{41775}So you stayed with the geeks?
{41779}{41836}The geeks and the lowlifes.
{41854}{41902}But then I went home.
{41908}{41977}That's how it is, when Ya'ir|and Ayala and you aren't there,
{41981}{42050}there is no point in staying.|Don't you know that?
{42054}{42084}That's funny.
{42102}{42186}I'm always sure that wherever I am|is where it's the least interesting.
{42210}{42287}Shame you didn't come to comfort us,|you'd see I was right.
{42324}{42394}They said your family didn't want|too many people coming.
{42421}{42477}Actually, I wanted you to come.
{42778}{42815}I have to go.
{42912}{42994}See you at the bonfire? - I may not|go to the youth group's bonfire.
{42998}{43017}Why not?
{43033}{43123}I think we'll have our own bonfire.|All the geeks and lowlives.
{43150}{43221}Shame.|My birthday's on Lag B'Omer.
{43225}{43278}What, right on the day?
{43289}{43342}According to the Gregorian calender|it's the day before.
{43346}{43392}A day before doesn't count.
{43458}{43478}'Bye.
{44061}{44129}Did you call for a ride?|- Thank you.
{44695}{44753}The world is like Noah's Ark.
{44758}{44814}If you're not in a couple,|you're left out.
{44818}{44856}What's so bad about that?
{44860}{44906}Maybe it's easier for men.
{44928}{45020}I want you to know, I look at you|and think how lucky you are.
{45025}{45125}You have two daughters,|a nice apartment, a community.
{45134}{45166}That's a lot.
{45209}{45267}And you're still young|and beautiful.
{45292}{45359}I probably won't have children.
{45368}{45415}I have some friends...
{45432}{45504}You've never had a serious|relationship with a woman?
{45519}{45574}All those women you met?
{45640}{45690}I'm attracted to women,|if that's what you're asking.
{45695}{45741}No, of course...|I just didn't understand.
{45745}{45817}But I've never had sexual relations|with a woman.
{46029}{46108}When I was at the Yeshiva, I said,|"I'll wait till I'm married."
{46123}{46163}And it didn't happen.
{46204}{46252}I'm sorry.|I didn't mean to embarrass you.
{46256}{46340}It's not something that usually|comes up. - It's okay. Really.
{46466}{46513}Are your parents alive?
{46562}{46599}Brothers? Sisters?
{46603}{46680}I have three sisters.|They're all grandmothers by now.
{46734}{46789}So you're in touch|with your nephews?
{46793}{46872}When they were kids,|I was the cool uncle.
{46894}{46945}The one who brought presents.
{46949}{46993}But in the last few years|everything changed.
{46997}{47044}They're busy with their own lives.
{47104}{47139}Everyone's busy.
{47193}{47242}What do you do on Shabbat?
{47295}{47323}Sleep.
{47665}{47743}Well, I think I'll be going.|It's late.
{48056}{48124}Good night, Yossi.|- Good night. Rachel.
{48131}{48223}If you ever need a ride anywhere,|call me. - Sure.
{48266}{48312}Good night.|- Good night.
{49186}{49258}Happy birthday, Tammy.|- Thanks.
{49262}{49326}You're welcome.|It's your birthday.
{49341}{49484}And I think this a great opportunity|for us to sit down and talk.
{49488}{49598}Since Dad died|I may not have done enough
{49602}{49708}to find out what you're going through,|but I'd like to change that.
{49713}{49795}I want to hear everything|you have to say, really I do.
{49799}{49881}Tell me everything that's|on your mind. Let it all out.
{49959}{50007}Tammy, do you want to start?
{50046}{50079}Esty can start.
{50140}{50211}In the last year|you've completely lost it.
{50215}{50277}That thing with the door,|what was that about?
{50282}{50332}The whole settlement thing,|Dad would never move there.
{50337}{50399}I'm sure he wouldn't have sucked up|to them like you do.
{50404}{50473}If that committee told you to run|around naked,
{50477}{50552}you'd do it and the last thing|you'd care about would be us.
{50583}{50632}That's what's on my mind.
{50784}{50809}Tammy?
{50904}{50968}I know you're having a hard time,|Mom,
{50983}{51039}but sometimes I feel...
{51045}{51119}you try so hard|to show the world we're okay,
{51123}{51199}that you overlook the fact that|we have feelings too.
{51226}{51346}We can't lead our lives according|to what Shula and Motke decree.
{51402}{51457}Of course, of course.
{51465}{51525}I'll take that into consideration.
{51541}{51580}I just want you to know
{51585}{51637}that you are the most precious|thing in the world to me
{51644}{51726}and that your lack of consideration|and cooperation...
{51764}{51816}I just feel that you do it|to spite me.
{51820}{51892}I feel that you blame me|for Dad's death.
{51912}{51952}You're young,|you don't understand...
{51957}{51996}and I hope you never will,
{52000}{52051}but I want you to understand this:
{52055}{52111}We're living under|a magnifying glass.
{52116}{52206}I want you to know that if we're not|accepted into this new settlement,
{52210}{52275}I'll be left here without|one single set of friends.
{52279}{52339}What you're doing is simply|spitting in my face.
{52343}{52405}If you want to be left|without a mother too,
{52410}{52460}then this is the way to achieve it.|- I don't need this.
{52464}{52508}Happy birthday. Tammy.
{53548}{53568}So you came?
{53573}{53651}No, but I brought you|a birthday present.
{53970}{53994}Thank you.
{53999}{54043}Do this with your hand.
{54311}{54366}Happy Birthday, Rafi -
{54417}{54442}Thank you.
{54513}{54609}Well, I'm off. They're waiting|for me at the bonfire. 'Bye.
{54639}{54664}'Bye.
{55412}{55479}{Y:i}Rejoice and be happy,|praise the holy word
{55484}{55553}{Y:i}Shimon Peres is a stinking turd...
{55734}{55829}{Y:i}Sanctify your life,|with the Torah
{55840}{55937}{Y:i}And purify it|through the labor.
{55945}{56056}{Y:i}Boys! The fruit of your labor|will make you happy!
{56060}{56176}{Y:i}Girls! The fruit of your labor|will make you happy!
{56506}{56600}Well? I hear from Moshe|that it was a big success.
{56604}{56671}That's what he told you?|- He hinted that it could lead somewhere,
{56676}{56724}but he wouldn't tell me too much.|You tell me.
{56728}{56773}It's a real experience,|to meet him, isn't it?
{56777}{56830}I'm very surprised|that's what he told you.
{56834}{56856}See?
{56860}{56946}Soon we won't know where you are,|you'll be globe-trotting with him!
{57329}{57398}How long do you think|he can mess with that piece of wood?
{57402}{57438}His entire life.
{57605}{57657}Want to go to Rafi's bonfire?
{57661}{57694}Now?
{57699}{57775}Why not?|We'll say hi to Rafi and come back.
{57779}{57808}I don't know.
{57812}{57882}No one here's giving us|the time of day anyway.
{57903}{57957}No. Forget it.|I don't feel like it.
{57992}{58062}Okay, I'm going.
{58423}{58479}{Y:i}Cute little girl|take off your shirt
{58483}{58554}{Y:i}And if you're sweaty|take off your bra
{58563}{58641}{Y:i}An angel from heaven|will come and kiss your breasts...
{58645}{58717}Let's go back.|Suddenly I don't feel like going.
{58721}{58770}Go back?|We're there already.
{58801}{58851}Let's at least say hi.
{58906}{58971}Okay, but if I want to go,|you're coming with me.
{58975}{59022}I'm not going back alone.
{59042}{59129}{Y:i}Tammy the whore|opened the store
{59133}{59203}{Y:i}Everyone's standing in line|with a huge hard-on
{59228}{59323}{Y:i}Inbal the whore|opened the store
{59338}{59413}{Y:i}Everyone's standing in line|with a huge hard-on
{59424}{59572}{Y:i}Here I pass|Standing near the stone
{59590}{59733}{Y:i}Rocks and ridges|A black asphalt road,
{59759}{59913}{Y:i}Evening falls slowly,|A sea breeze blows
{59932}{60062}{Y:i}The first star shines|Over beit-Machsir
{60104}{60255}{Y:i}Bab-el-Wad, forever|remember our names
{60293}{60442}{Y:i}Convoys broke through|on their way to the city...
{60462}{60498}Anyway, he pays her,
{60503}{60587}She comes over and undresses him,|he does her and comes,
{60591}{60659}she gets dressed,|so he says to her: Just a minute,
{60663}{60703}this was a regular fuck,|what was Spanish about it?
{60707}{60759}So she says:|You're right, I forgot.
{60763}{60799}Ole!
{60823}{60869}Hey, you morons,|you don't get jokes.
{60873}{60913}No, that was funny.|Great joke.
{60926}{60979}Here's another. The same rabbit|walks in the forest.
{60983}{61040}Wait, wait a minute.|Enough of your rabbit.
{61057}{61100}Maybe the girls have a joke.
{61109}{61149}Give them a chance.
{61153}{61213}Go on, relax a bit.|Got a joke? Tell us.
{61217}{61299}I'll laugh for sure.|Here, I'm already laughing.
{61307}{61354}Okay, I have a joke.
{61359}{61448}I don't believe it.|- Not very funny, but never mind.
{61500}{61593}A guy decides to give his wife|a jacuzzi for her birthday.
{61610}{61696}She's happy, gives him a kiss.
{61700}{61750}They both undress|and get into the jacuzzi,
{61755}{61796}splash around in the water.
{61806}{61856}Suddenly the doorbell rings.
{61863}{61910}So the wife gets out,|puts on her robe
{61915}{61963}and goes to see who it is.
{61968}{62036}When she opens the door it's|the upstairs neighbor, Mr. Cohen.
{62058}{62157}He looks at her with her robe|half open and says:
{62161}{62219}I didn't know you were so pretty.
{62240}{62325}I'll give you 100 dollars if you|open your robe more at the neck.
{62333}{62379}Just a little.|Half an inch.
{62383}{62461}So she opens her robe a little|at the neck,
{62465}{62553}Mr. Cohen looks and gives her|100 dollars.
{62609}{62657}Wow, this is|such a stupid joke...
{62662}{62748}Why? - Go on. You can't stop in|the middle of a joke. It's the rule.
{62756}{62780}Okay.
{62807}{62932}So Mr. Cohen looks at her legs
{62945}{63007}and says: If you open the robe|a little on the bottom,
{63011}{63057}I'll give you 100 dollars.
{63062}{63112}Open it just a tiny bit.|- Wait, what about the husband?
{63116}{63185}He didn't notice that his|wife is opening her robe? - Shut up!
{63191}{63230}Don't you know this joke?
{63277}{63325}Everyone came.
{63339}{63375}It was a success, wasn't it?
{63380}{63428}It's always a success.
{63477}{63535}Pity we didn't invite|Moshe Weinstock tonight.
{63551}{63599}Well, he's not|in the founding group.
{63610}{63670}But maybe Rachel will persuade him|to join us.
{63703}{63771}It was really successful tonight.|- It was, wasn't it?
{63775}{63809}Good night.|- I'm glad you came.
{63813}{63877}See you tomorrow at the march.|- Yes, sure.
{63881}{63936}Good night.|- Good night.
{65573}{65637}Yossi?|Did I wake you?
{65646}{65683}It's Rachel.
{65700}{65740}Hello.
{65766}{65907}I thought you might want to come|to the march with me tomorrow.
{65988}{66064}Cool. I didn't know girls had jokes|like that. - You'd be surprised.
{66071}{66142}You're crazy. Girls are twice as|horny as guys.
{66149}{66188}Am I right?
{66192}{66252}If I knew what it's like for guys,|I'd tell you.
{66290}{66340}I can't believe|you're even answering him.
{66345}{66410}Okay, I'm cold.|I want to go back.
{66432}{66480}I have a jacket in the car.|Want it?
{66485}{66535}You sure?|- You coming?
{66540}{66586}Stay a bit longer.|Don't go.
{66592}{66657}Till the fire goes out,|then we'll walk you back.
{66662}{66691}Okay?
{66696}{66755}If you like, you can sit|in the car and warm up.
{66764}{66847}Come to the side for a moment.|- What? Why leave?
{66882}{66949}Till the fire goes out,|then we'll go. I promise.
{67014}{67070}Okay, I'll be in the car.
{67652}{67716}Shirt hanging out,|shoelaces untied.
{67720}{67757}Didn't know where I came from.
{67762}{67807}Like I'm a reserve guy,|he says:
{67812}{67897}Soldier, over here!|So immediately I start to limp.
{67925}{68015}Sorry, do you mind|if I put my hand there?
{68059}{68103}I think the fire's going out.|No?
{68108}{68146}Wait, sweetie,|where're you going?
{68151}{68188}I think I'd better go.
{68193}{68261}Yaniv, go get the jerrycan.|Do me a favor.
{68267}{68337}Wait a minute, what's the rush?|- Leave me alone, I want to go.
{68342}{68419}Okay, we said, till the fire|goes out. It's not out yet.
{68431}{68489}Yaniv, pour some on we'll see if|it's gone out. - Let go of her, llan.
{68494}{68534}Pour it!
{68812}{68887}What? Just a kiss.|What's the big deal?
{68913}{68945}You okay?
{68986}{69064}Just say if you're okay or not.|I don't want you to start screaming.
{69069}{69094}You okay?
{69134}{69181}I want to leave.|- No problem.
{69200}{69240}Anyone stopping you?
{69429}{69483}What about the others?
{69489}{69539}They don't deserve|a goodnight kiss?
{69544}{69593}What about Goslan?|He doesn't deserve one?
{69599}{69641}And my brother doesn't deserve one?
{69645}{69712}Come on, Goslan,|let's see what you can do.
{69724}{69763}I'm holding her,|do what you want.
{69767}{69801}Let her go,|you'll get into trouble.
{69805}{69854}She agrees.|What are you uptight about?
{69861}{69906}You agree, don't you?
{69919}{69971}What did she come here for?
{70180}{70251}Here, see?|She agrees.
{70320}{70370}What do you think?|That's how women are.
{70375}{70442}First they say no,|but then they enjoy it.
{70446}{70479}Do you think|she doesn't want it?
{70484}{70556}Sure she does.|She just won't say she wants it.
{70984}{71046}It feels good, right?|See? It's not so bad.
{71051}{71077}Can't you see she's crying?
{71083}{71120}Come on, let her go, Goslan.|Let her go!
{71124}{71182}What are you yelling about?|Are you her father?
{71195}{71254}We're just playing around.|No big deal.
{71284}{71348}Here, I'm letting her go.
{71548}{71595}If she touches my dick,|I'll let her go.
{71612}{71641}I swear.
{71704}{71757}Just touch it for a second,|and I'll let you go.
{71766}{71838}What do you care?|No force, just a little touch.
{71844}{71872}That's all.
{71920}{71975}Convince her to say yes,|and I'll let her go.
{71992}{72042}What's the big deal?
{72101}{72160}Here,|I'll give you ten shekels too.
{72243}{72274}Come on, Tammy.
{72360}{72415}I'll let you go right after.|I swear.
{72431}{72490}Just a tiny touch,|and you get to keep the money.
{72553}{72595}Don't play hard to get.
{72602}{72650}And then|you swear you'll let her go?
{72664}{72721}I swear.|I swear by my mother.
{72848}{72895}Do you agree?
{73162}{73235}Tammy! Tammy!
{73247}{73350}Tammy! Tammy! Tammy!
{74344}{74403}What's the matter, Rafi?|Are you okay?
{74440}{74499}Look,|I'm sorry I hit you earlier.
{74578}{74627}I just wanted|to tell you something.
{74649}{74720}It's better to fuck some bimbo|than to be a snitch.
{74776}{74825}I hope you understand that.
{75732}{75799}You're Tammy, right?|- Yes.
{75811}{75850}I'm Yossi.
{75882}{75909}I know.
{75920}{75983}Your mother asked me to|drive her to the march.
{75987}{76041}So I'm waiting for her.
{76050}{76092}Shall I get her?|- No.
{76100}{76149}We're supposed to meet in|ten minutes. I'm just early.
{76153}{76195}I don't want her to be pressured.
{76270}{76328}Were you at the bonfire all night?|- Yeah.
{76370}{76463}What fun.|How I miss those days.
{76820}{76871}I hope you had a good time.|- What?
{76886}{76967}Ayala and Ya'ir got home|two hours ago.
{76978}{77052}Can you tell me where you've been|till now? - With Inbal.
{77097}{77167}What's that smell?|Did you sit inside the bonfire?
{77174}{77229}By the way, your ride is here.
{78300}{78371}How was yesterday?|- It was nice. Pity you didn't come.
{78379}{78437}I thought only the founding group|was invited.
{78568}{78616}Maybe we shouldn't go to the march?
{78620}{78663}Really?|- Yes.
{78726}{78797}So where do you want to go?|- I don't know.
{78815}{78875}Maybe somewhere with less people.
{78895}{78944}I know just the place.
{79102}{79145}Gerlick -
{79323}{79389}Hello there.|- Hi.
{79472}{79537}Is Tammy home?|- Yes. Want to come in?
{79542}{79584}I'll get her.
{79589}{79636}What's your name?|- Rafi.
{79641}{79687}Just a second, Rafi.
{79948}{80005}I don't know.|She won't answer me.
{80014}{80105}Maybe you want to come back this|afternoon? - No, it's okay. Thanks.
{80146}{80179}'Bye.
{80235}{80288}Do you miss your husband?
{80294}{80352}The girls miss him.
{80362}{80406}And you?
{80410}{80485}I miss having a man in the house.
{80502}{80590}But my marriage wasn't very good.|I married so young...
{80637}{80692}So why did you stay with him?
{80728}{80768}I don't know.
{80806}{80863}He was good to me.
{80940}{81012}What's with all the questions?|- Sorry.
{81017}{81081}No, it's okay.|You can ask.
{81107}{81154}I don't mind.
{81177}{81232}What do you want to know?
{81289}{81348}Did he know you didn't love him?
{81387}{81436}I think so.
{81511}{81544}More questions.
{81567}{81637}I have one more,|but I'm afraid of your response.
{81645}{81706}Ask away.|Worst case, I won't answer.
{81848}{81930}Is there any chance of you sleeping|with a man you're not married to?
{82088}{82178}You're very direct.|- Sorry. I shouldn't have asked that.
{82239}{82291}And if I asked you|the same question?
{82398}{82446}I've decided I would.
{82901}{82967}Where's Tammy?|- In her room.
{83181}{83238}Tammy, did you lock the door?
{83245}{83294}Shall I bring the hammer?
{83320}{83401}Tammy, open the door. - She's been|locked in since this morning.
{83411}{83454}Tammy, are you all right?
{83459}{83529}What do you mean, since this|morning? - I mean this morning.
{83534}{83583}Which part don't you get?
{83624}{83717}Tammy, why did you lock the door?|You know we don't lock doors here.
{83721}{83747}I'm sorry.
{83798}{83862}What's this? Don't you want|to change? Take a shower?
{83869}{83921}I'm tired.|Tomorrow, okay, Mom?
{84198}{84277}Someone named Moshe Weinstock|called. Twice.
{84294}{84372}Said to tell you he's coming to that|scouting trip of yours tomorrow.
{84461}{84539}So what did you tell him? - Don't|worry, I didn't spoil it for you.
{84651}{84775}{Y:i}And the sons, and the sons|returned to their homeland...
{85512}{85570}Where the hell are we?
{85621}{85723}Motke, couldn't you settle|somewhere closer to the city?
{85732}{85783}What, Ramallah isn't a city?
{87644}{87676}Why did you leave?
{87690}{87732}You can't hear a thing anyway,|with all that wind.
{87736}{87805}Get used to it. Do you know what|the wind is like here at night?
{88237}{88304}There are rumors going around about|what happened at Rafi's bonfire.
{88341}{88410}What are you talking about?|- Rumors.
{88485}{88592}I just wanted to say,|I don't blame you or anything.
{88670}{88777}And if you want to talk about it,|you can talk to me.
{89010}{89124}I just think that if we're going to|live together in this settlement,
{89139}{89179}we should talk.
{89222}{89299}What did you hear? What rumors?|- All kinds of things.
{89317}{89377}Tell me.|I want to know what you heard.
{89404}{89445}Don't you know?
{89476}{89496}No.
{89543}{89598}That you put out.
{89635}{89682}That I put out?
{89695}{89756}But I told you,|I don't blame you.
{89760}{89828}It's natural.
{90011}{90062}Ya'ir, what are you doing?
{90111}{90150}Are you crazy?|What are you doing?
{90154}{90205}I thought you wanted to.|- Idiot!
{90209}{90250}What happened?
{90716}{90737}Hi.
{91401}{91483}It's not right. Why didn't they|say there'd be cows here?
{91795}{91824}So beautiful.
{92892}{92952}Tammy, go in.|I'm coming.
{92970}{93010}Good night.
{93112}{93188}I'm sorry, I didn't plan|for Moshe Weinstock to be there
{93192}{93284}but I couldn't hurt his feelings.|- I know. It's okay.
{93316}{93418}Though Weinstock doesn't seem|the type to take offense easily.
{93434}{93482}You've noticed.
{93589}{93636}He invited me|to come to his concert.
{93675}{93740}Are you going?|- I don't know.
{93758}{93817}I told him I'd have to see|if I can make it.
{93844}{93902}It's really funny, you know...
{93912}{93982}Shmuel, my husband, wanted to be|a cantor. He loved cantorial music.
{93986}{94039}And he had a good voice.
{94044}{94107}But he was too shy|to sing in front of people.
{94121}{94215}I really hated it. He'd try to|drag me to all these concerts.
{94219}{94295}We'd fight,|and finally he'd go alone.
{94357}{94405}Go to that concert.
{94428}{94482}I hear he's pretty good.
{94693}{94749}I have to go.|- Okay.
{94772}{94838}If you need a ride anywhere...|- I'll call.
{95164}{95225}I know you're waiting|for someone better than me.
{95255}{95339}I can even understand it. I just|want you to know that I love you.
{95371}{95426}I think you're|a very special woman.
{95515}{95574}It's okay.|You don't have to answer me.
{95625}{95699}Good night.|- Good night.
{96093}{96178}I'm not waiting for someone better|than you. Don't ever say that.
{96194}{96259}You're the nicest person|I've ever met.
{96286}{96329}So what are you waiting for?
{96401}{96437}I don't know.
{96480}{96522}I'm waiting to fall in love.
{96560}{96619}I'm 42 years old,|and I've never been in love.
{96677}{96767}Shula says I shouldn't|wait for fireworks,
{96772}{96831}but that's exactly|what I'm waiting for.
{96963}{97045}You're so self-centered, you don't|even hear what you're saying.
{97051}{97103}Good night, Rachel.
{97612}{97679}What's that?|- Holy shit!
{97684}{97768}- Tammy Gerlick's a whore -|My mother will die.
{97778}{97853}Each candidate commits himself|in writing to be able
{97857}{97919}to pay the settlement's|monthly taxes. - No, wait, wait.
{97923}{98004}I just don't think it's my job to|check other people's bank accounts.
{98009}{98108}No, but they can sign a statement|that they're able to pay the taxes.
{98112}{98149}That's what the committee|is for, right?
{98154}{98260}But it means that from the onset|people without money can't join.
{98264}{98343}I want to get this straight. Is that|the message we want to send out?
{98347}{98420}It's not about a message. It's|about reasonable administration.
{98426}{98489}We're about to start a settlement|with very low living expenses.
{98493}{98540}A trailer or a mobile home|hardly costs anything.
{98546}{98615}If you want to control the quality|of your neighbors, you have to make sure
{98619}{98692}they're not here just because|it's the cheapest solution. See?
{98699}{98798}But our goal is not just to settle|the land, but to unite the people.
{98803}{98878}So let the National Committee add|a clause about uniting the people.
{98893}{98975}I'm not moving to the middle|of nowhere to live in a slum.
{99005}{99090}That's the whole idea. An|ideological settlement. Simple.
{99153}{99233}And you should be the first to know|what I'm talking about, Rachel.
{99401}{99470}Could you tell me|what that's supposed to mean?
{99504}{99615}Take a walk around the neighborhood.|It's all over the walls.
{99719}{99831}Remember, these are the worst years.|From now on things will get better.
{99846}{99921}How many years, exactly,|until the worst part is over?
{99931}{99990}Two years, three at the most.
{100024}{100103}Just take a deep breath and hold|your nose till high school's over.
{100111}{100173}Then go do your National Service|in the desert, or somewhere.
{100178}{100228}As far away from here as possible.
{100233}{100315}Not like me. If Dad hadn't died,|I'd go serve in Eilat,
{100321}{100381}or even in Egypt.
{100606}{100659}How I hated it|when he smoked.
{100719}{100767}I miss him so much.
{100803}{100844}I know.|Me too.
{100876}{100956}Whenever I think of him I remember|how Mom would drive him crazy.
{100960}{100981}Poor guy.
{101644}{101709}Want to tell me|what happened at the bonfire?
{103381}{103458}Esty.|Esty, wake up.
{103494}{103556}What do you want?|- I need your help.
{104171}{104226}When are you coming back today?
{104285}{104347}Are you talking to me?|- Yes, I want us to buy you sandals.
{104352}{104407}I don't have time today.|- So find time.
{104411}{104467}Would you talk to me for one minute?|- I'm late.
{104472}{104538}Never mind. Be late.|I want to talk to you.
{104554}{104648}I'm not angry with you. I just want|to know what happened at the bonfire
{104692}{104753}Tammy, if you don't tell me,|I won't be able to help you.
{104758}{104812}If someone hurt you,|I have to know about it.
{104816}{104902}Mom, I beg you, don't do anything.|- That's exactly what hurts me.
{104906}{104980}You didn't come to me when it|happened. Am I your enemy?
{104984}{105033}It's good to know what hurts you.
{105037}{105101}I don't need your help.|- Why are you taking that tone with me?
{105106}{105174}You don't need my help?|Are you trying to punish me again?
{105187}{105218}My life isn't hard enough?
{105222}{105287}I need to hear from Shula Kupfer|that my daughter's a whore?
{105292}{105348}Do you have any idea|where I spent the night?
{105353}{105412}I went around erasing graffiti|from the walls.
{105451}{105486}Thank you very much|for your help.
{105490}{105561}I want to know where all the|counsellors were when it happened!
{105566}{105636}How's it possible that I send|a 15 year-old, innocent child
{105641}{105671}to a Bnei Akiva bonfire
{105675}{105734}and she ends up spending the|night with a bunch of hoodlums?
{105738}{105773}I won't keep quiet about this.
{105777}{105856}I'm telling you, no one will get|away with this! I promise you!
{106127}{106155}Hello.
{106204}{106278}No, my Dad died a year ago.|If you want to buy our car,
{106282}{106347}you'll have to talk to my mother.|Good luck.
{106451}{106508}We know who they are|and it's being taken care of.
{106513}{106546}Believe me, it is.
{106560}{106622}This isn't the first time|we've had trouble with them.
{106628}{106669}So what are they doing|at Bnei Akiva?
{106673}{106721}Why didn't they...|- It's not that simple, Rachel.
{106751}{106827}They didn't come to the Center,|your daughter came to them.
{106858}{106926}We can't control everything|that goes on outside the Center.
{106932}{107018}But what am I supposed to do?|It could happen to another girl.
{107060}{107118}The fact is,|it didn't happen to another girl.
{107194}{107280}Motke, I'm going to the police.
{107286}{107336}And you'll be sorry|for the rest of your life.
{107352}{107438}You really want some cop to start|questioning all of Tammy's friends?
{107442}{107509}You don't know what really|happened there, either.
{107531}{107585}You don't let out things|like this.
{107589}{107627}Believe me,|it'll make the papers
{107631}{107704}and the whole world will talk|about the slut from Bnei Akiva
{107709}{107759}who seduced the boys in her group.|- She didn't seduce them!
{107764}{107847}She's not a slut, she didn't seduce them|- That's not what I said.
{107851}{107915}I said that's what they'll say|if it comes out.
{108003}{108049}So what am I supposed to do?
{108055}{108124}Nothing. It'll blow over, Rachel.
{108166}{108206}I promise you.
{108845}{108986}{Y:i}Look from Heaven|and perceive
{109016}{109165}{Y:i}That we have become an object|of scorn and derision
{109295}{109383}{Y:i}among the nations
{112691}{112757}Yossi, it's Rachel.
{112816}{112872}I need a ride.|Urgently.
{112892}{112939}I don't know...
{113553}{113614}Are you okay?|- No.
{113956}{114049}I'm sorry. I'm a horrible person.|- No. You're not.
{114134}{114251}I hurt everyone around me.|Shmuel, my girls, now you.
{114255}{114325}Something's wrong with me.|- Not true.
{114476}{114583}Remember what you said that night,|under my house?
{114607}{114675}I'm trying to forget.|- Don't forget.
{114719}{114776}I want you to love me.
{115603}{115672}But I already love you.
{116392}{116444}I'm going to wake them.
{116613}{116663}You know Yossi, don't you?
{116667}{116786}Esty, you haven't met Yossi.|Yossi, Esty. Esty, Yossi.
{116803}{116889}I have two very important things|I want to discuss.
{116912}{116948}First...
{116967}{117057}I want to know what you think|of the new settlement.
{117072}{117185}Before Motke calls his vote,|I want us to have our own vote.
{117289}{117355}Who's against moving|to the new settlement?
{117662}{117740}Okay.|Now, Tammy...
{117748}{117819}I want to talk to you alone,|in your room.
{118379}{118466}I just want to know that you're|all right, that nobody hurt you.
{118489}{118552}If you don't want to tell me,|you don't have to.
{118563}{118619}You can tell someone else,
{118626}{118710}the school counselor,|a psychologist.
{118743}{118827}You can write it down on a piece|of paper if you're embarrassed.
{118866}{118916}But it's not good to keep silent.
{118980}{119040}Silence is what I want now, Mom.
{119074}{119107}I'm okay.
{119240}{119280}I believe you.
{119359}{119403}I trust you.
{119804}{119838}I'm okay.
{119875}{119910}Don't worry.
{121537}{121575}Are you leaving?
{121599}{121647}I have to work this morning.
{121651}{121710}Don't you want to drink something?|- No, thanks.
{121714}{121770}I'm really late already.|Thanks.
{121878}{121923}Need a ride to school?
{121940}{121998}Hang on, I'll bring my bag.
{122144}{122234}Why did you run away this morning?|- You ran away too, didn't you?
{122238}{122278}What do you mean?
{122305}{122393}Do you usually go to school|at six-twenty in the morning?
{122471}{122519}So you don't have to work?
{122542}{122608}My mother will be offended.|- You think?
{122612}{122662}She likes to take offense.
{122677}{122773}So maybe it's better not to tell her|I didn't have to work this morning.
{122921}{122976}Why didn't you ever get married?
{123066}{123135}I guess something's wrong with me.|- I'm serious.
{123139}{123176}So am I.
{123284}{123387}God doesn't want certain people|to marry, so they won't reproduce.
{123391}{123454}So He spoils something|in their personality.
{123458}{123536}Something little,|that you don't notice at first.
{123557}{123619}But that something|makes them stay alone.
{123654}{123705}That doesn't make sense to me.
{123721}{123830}I know some couples... I can't|believe God wants them to reproduce.
{123905}{123964}So you think you'll never marry?
{124123}{124166}Chances are, no.
{124204}{124304}My mother will be sad to wake up|and find you gone. - You think?
{124310}{124343}I think so.
{124540}{124591}So we won't see you anymore?
{125120}{125177}Hello. Come in.|- Hello.
{125238}{125316}We'll sit in the living room.|A drink? - No, thank you.
{125320}{125389}Shall I bring you coffee and cake?|- No, thank you.
{125478}{125550}How's Tammy? Is everything alright?|- Tammy's fine.
{125554}{125601}I'm glad to hear it.
{125615}{125680}It's terrible what's happening|at the Center...
{125684}{125775}Some kids in Tammy's group|come from very problematic homes.
{125779}{125850}You wouldn't believe the stories|I hear from Ya'ir.
{125866}{125939}But things will probably be|much easier in the settlement.
{125944}{126067}You're in. We had a vote yesterday,|and I insisted you'd be in.
{126071}{126110}That's it.
{126115}{126166}What, did I surprise you?
{126171}{126228}Now the real thing begins.|There's lots of work.
{126232}{126280}Before we start|with the real thing,
{126285}{126349}I came to tell you that|I don't want to join the settlement.
{126353}{126408}I'm giving up my place.
{126460}{126524}What do you mean?|- I don't want to be there.
{126543}{126576}I don't understand.
{126581}{126666}I'm in shock! Do you realize how|hard Motke worked to get you in?
{126673}{126751}It was your dream.|Can you tell me what happened?
{126755}{126852}Well, I'm sure you'll find|a good family to replace us.
{126962}{126983}Well...
{126989}{127088}I'm shocked. Simply shocked.|- Stop being shocked about everything.
{127092}{127146}Don't talk to me like that!
{127168}{127228}Well, I think I'll be on my way.
{127249}{127317}I wish you the best of luck.
{127333}{127393}By the way, if you don't want|a reputation for being picky,
{127397}{127446}you should return|Moshe Weinstock's calls.
{127450}{127493}It's not very considerate|towards us either.
{127497}{127599}How picky can I be if I've been|your friend for all those years?
{127802}{127844}How ungrateful!
{128891}{128929}Hi. - Hi.
{128973}{129054}How did you know where I live?|- You're on the contact list.
{129058}{129154}Rafi, you coming? - Just a minute,|Goslan. I'll be right there.
{129230}{129296}I feel so shitty about|what happened at the bonfire.
{129340}{129387}Why did you come over there,|anyway?
{129404}{129435}For you.
{129759}{129800}So we'll be seeing you?
{129848}{129914}Do you want to see me?|- Yes.
{130163}{130249}{Y:i}And I decided that at all costs,|no matter what,
{130253}{130300}{Y:i}this year I'll be happy.
{130670}{130694}Start it!
