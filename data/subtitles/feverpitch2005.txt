00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:33,700
[Man Narrating] Eighty-six
years of banging our heads
against the big green wall,

2
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:35,535
but we finally did it.

3
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:39,122
That part you know.
That part everybody knows.

4
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:42,083
But I got a story
you don't know.

5
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:45,878
It's about this schoolteacher
friend of mine named Ben.

6
00:00:45,963 --> 00:00:49,799
This is him, back in 1980,
when he was a kid.

7
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:52,802
The little guy
was going through
a tough time.

8
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,554
His parents
had just got divorced,

9
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:56,597
and his mom
dragged him up here
to Boston

10
00:00:56,682 --> 00:00:58,599
where he didn't know nobody.

11
00:00:58,684 --> 00:01:02,103
One day Ben's mom says,
"Enough mopin' around,"

12
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:05,064
and she calls her brother Carl
to take him somewhere,

13
00:01:05,149 --> 00:01:09,026
anywhere, just to get
the kid out of the house.

14
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:11,571
Uncle Carl didn't have
any children of his own,

15
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:15,158
so he wasn't exactly
what you'd call "kid savvy."

16
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:18,161
I'm not gonna
have to change him
or anything, am I?

17
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:22,123
Carl, look at him.
He's seven, you dope.
Come here.

18
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:25,251
Carl wasn't the kind of uncle
who was gonna take you
to the circus

19
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:27,754
or the zoo
or a puppet show,

20
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:30,923
but he did know
the greatest place
to bring any kid,

21
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:34,677
the heart and soul of Boston,
Fenway Park.

22
00:01:47,858 --> 00:01:50,359
That was also the day
I met Ben.

23
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:51,986
The pretty boy
with the glasses?

24
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:55,114
That's me, Al Waterman.
I sell sponges.

25
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:57,450
Now that's
the Green Monster, kid.

26
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:58,868
Monster?
Yep.

27
00:01:59,203 --> 00:02:01,412
[Narrating]
I taught the boy
what I knew about the game,

28
00:02:01,497 --> 00:02:03,164
and Carl taught him
what he knew.

29
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:07,210
Hey, Zimmer, you idiot,
what are you batting
this bum leadoff for?

30
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:12,673
[Narrator]
Dwight Evans parked
a couple homers, the Sox won,

31
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:17,553
and by day's end, poor Ben
had become one of God's
most pathetic creatures,

32
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:19,388
a Red Sox fan.
Wow!

33
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,767
And that's where
the story begins.

34
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,813
Careful, kid.
They'll break your heart.

35
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,234

36
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:37,532
[Man Speaking]
I'm gonna tell you a story

37
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:39,742
I'm gonna tell you
about my town

38
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:43,412
I'm gonna tell you
a big fat story, baby

39
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:46,374
Aw, it's all about my town

40
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:52,964
Yeah, down by the river

41
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:56,342
Down by the banks
of the River Charles

42
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:58,344
Aw, that's what's
happening, baby

43
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:02,098
You could have gone over
right there. Come on,
you gotta be aggressive, man.

44
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:05,059
Take off the training wheels.
Hey, I got a crowbar
under the seat, okay?

45
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:07,061
So don't make me
knock your teeth out.

46
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:08,896
What are you doing?
[Girls Chatting On Phones]

47
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:11,357
Audrey and Tammy,
are you guys talking
to each other on the phone?

48
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:13,651

We're conferencing Amanda.
She's home sick.

49

Mr. Wrightman.

Okay, so I asked for
no ham, double turkey,

55
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:32,628
but it looks like
they gave me double ham.

56
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:35,840
Do you want me to go back?
Uh, no. Just toss
some of it in my mouth.

57
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:38,134
And that teacher's here
with those kids.
What?

58
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,553
That teacher you talked to
on the phone, about coming in,
having a tour.

Oh, oh, God,
that's today?

They're here.
Oh, no.

Okay, uh, just pretend
that you're me and take them
around and... Hi.

00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:52,940
There they are.
Ben Wrightman.
We talked on the phone.

63
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:56,777
Nice to meet you.
Yes, yes,
I've been waiting for you.

64

Hi, I'm Lindsey Meeks.

65
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:01,157
Excuse me.

00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,159
Can I get anyone
something to drink?

67
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,995
Vodka martini, straight up.
Three olives, please.

68
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:07,997
Hey, I asked you
to behave.

69
00:04:08,332 --> 00:04:10,166
Uh, are you allowed
to hit them?

70
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,919
Yeah, actually.
Do you wanna take
a swipe at him?

71
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:14,962
I'll hold him
if you want.

72
00:04:15,631 --> 00:04:18,883
Maybe later.
Uh, okay. As I said
on the phone, Lindsey,

73
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:21,218
I teach honors geometry,
ninth grade.

74
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:23,846
And every year
I pick a few promising
math students

75
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:26,807
to meet someone
who's pursued mathematics as
an educational discipline

76
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:30,102
and has made practical use
of that education.

77
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:32,396
So, thanks
for having us.

78
00:04:34,066 --> 00:04:35,399
All right, the client
I'm working for right now

79
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:38,110
is this really cool company
called Marquis Jet,

80
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:39,403
and they're trying
to figure out

81
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:41,989
how to make
renting private jets
more affordable.

82
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:45,159
Wow. Now that's
the way to go.

83
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:47,244
Yeah, and they're growing
like crazy,

84
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:49,497
so they'd have to
buy more jets in order
to meet the demands.

85
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:51,749
Now let me ask you guys
a crazy question.

86
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,126
Are any of you in the habit
of looking at numbers,

87
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:57,838
you know, addresses,
license plates, phone numbers,
and adding them up

88
00:04:57,923 --> 00:05:01,550
and rearranging them
in your head to make
more interesting patterns?

89
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:05,888
Oh, my God,
she knows my secret shame.

90
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:10,685
Well, step into the light,
my friend, because this is
the church of numbers,

91
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:12,770
and every day is Sunday.

92
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:17,942
She was a major hottie.
Major?

93
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:21,070
Colonel hottie.
Yeah, she went optic
for you, Mr. Wrightman.

94
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:24,073
Optic?
Yeah, I saw her
glance to the pants.

95
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,491
No way.
Yeah.

96
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:26,701
What do you mean?

97
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:30,371
I mean she was totally...
No, no, not you.
You. What did you mean?

98
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:33,541
Nothin', you know.

99
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:36,252
Well, come on, man.
You saw her.

100
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:40,715
What? Wait.
Are you saying that
she's out of my league?

101
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:43,175
She is bringing
some serious heat, man.

102

I don't know
if you got the bat speed.

103
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,557
Oh, I got the bat speed.
I got plenty of bat speed.
I could hit her best cheese.

from earlier today.
Oh. Yeah.

109
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:08,534
Maybe I should become
a teacher or
a college professor, you know.

110
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:12,371

they're gonna bring someone
in from the outside?

115
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,470
I have... I don't know.
Or do you think they're
gonna promote from within?

becoming a teacher.

I didn't wanna interrupt.

you were involved with

Oh, well,
there's a position
about to open up,

mildly murderous
around here.

'cause neither of us
are speaking?

I came back because
I just...

I wanted to ask you if I could
ask you out sometime.

go out with me. She thinks
I'm not in her class.

No. I could see it
on her face.

date a schoolteacher."

and back there.

so what's the matter
with this one?

He's not attractive?

155

He was.
It's just, you know...

It's hopeless.

is, shall we say, bearish.

more open and available,
I'm becoming less open.

00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,141
Why?
What do you mean?

164
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:24,104
Well, all the guys you date
are sharp and competitive
and successful.

165
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,690
It's like
you're dating yourself.
Ding, ding, ding.

166
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:30,444
Wh... What's wrong
with the schoolteacher?

167
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:33,948
Well...
He's a schoolteacher.

168
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:37,660
Which means he has
a small... Income.

169
00:09:37,953 --> 00:09:42,206
All right, people,
let's shut your piehole
and speed it back up. Come on!

170
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:46,710
Come on!
Die, you Nazi spin-bitch.

171
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:50,172
[Bell Rings]

172
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:57,012
[Whistling]
Hey! Go, run a post. Go!

173
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:00,182
Oh!
[Chuckles]

174
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:02,351
Who did that?

175
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:05,521
That's it.
You're coming with me, Mister.

176
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,690
What do you think,
this is your own
private playground?

177
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,858
Get in here.

178
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:17,241
Thanks, man.
I owe you one.

179
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:20,953
Go ahead.

180
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:25,499
[Whistling]

181
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,460
Hey, Ben, are you going
to watch the Celtics later?

182
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:30,629
Uh, I don't know.

183
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:33,924
You know,
there are other sports
besides baseball.

184
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:35,384
I would debate you, Ed,

185
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,761
but that would only lead to
me being dragged away
in handcuffs.

186
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:41,473
Hey, speaking of baseball,
Ben, wanna help me coach
the J.V. Team this year?

187
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:45,394
Why? You're doing a great job.
I mean, you can't just go
by wins and losses.

188
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,438
Aw, come on, Ben.
The kids listen to you.

189
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:50,149
I think it's going good
the way it is, you know?

190
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:52,151
You coach the team,
and I help out whenever I can.

191
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:55,237
Then, if I don't
make it or...

192
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:58,699
Hey, Rita,
when did I get this message
from Lindsey Meeks?

193
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:03,412
A tip might be
where it says
"Time called: 2:30."

194
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:05,748
[Whistles]

195
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:08,000
Come on, pull!

196
00:11:09,044 --> 00:11:11,712
So, do you think it'll be
a problem that you're more
successful than him?

197
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:15,591
Who says I am?
Well, I mean,
at least financially.

198
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:19,136
It's not like he's playing
a flute with a hatful of
dollar bills in front of him.

199
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,473
He's a teacher.
Teaching's
a cool thing.

200
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:25,726
Yeah. Besides, why does
everything in my life
have to be a trophy?

201
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:28,854
I mean, who am I
trying to impress?
Hey, we're on your side.

202
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:31,815
No, I know.
It's just that I hate
when people... [Gasps]

203
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:35,027
Ow!
Oopsie.

[Lindsey Groaning]

205
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:54,463
Oh, just kill me.
Just take a hammer
and kill me.

207
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:05,724
[Doorbell Rings]
Oh, shit.
Who is it?

208
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:08,310
I... It's me. It's Ben.
Your date?

209
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,729
Oh, God, no.

210
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:13,315
Oh.
[Door Lock Clicks]

211
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:19,947
I'm sick. Come back.
I'll call you tomorrow.
Go away.

212
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:22,366
Wait, wait, wait.
What kind of sick?
You okay? You in pain?

213
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:27,037
I... [Swallows]
Ate at this new place.

214
00:12:27,122 --> 00:12:29,248
I think...

[Vomiting]

216
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,215
Are you faking it?
'Cause we don't have to
really do this if you don't...

217
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:41,176
[Vomiting Continues]

218
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,851
Mommy.

219
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,314
Ernie, go away.

220
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,859
Ernie, don't eat that!

221
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:58,610
Oh, shit.

222
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:01,488
Uh...

223
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,450
So, you wanna pull the plug
on this thing or...

224

[Vomiting, Choking,

225
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:16,420
All right, here we go.
Come on.

226
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,672
All right,
we're almost there.

227
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:21,592
Okay. Okay.

228
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:24,303
Now sit right here.
Oh, God!

229
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:27,222
All right. Okay.
Here. Pick your head up.

Up. Okay, up.

232
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:34,188
Uh, all right. Um...

233
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:37,191
Do you have any, like,
pajamas or a nightgown?

234
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,776
In the top drawer.

235
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:42,529
Top drawer. Okay.

236
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:45,240
All right, here we go.

237
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:48,702
[Chuckles]
Well, Wonder Woman's
been looking for these.

238
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:50,746
I gotta call her.
Let her know they're here.

239
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:58,003
Okay. All right.
I'll help you up.
Mm-mm.

240
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,881
Get up.
[Groans]
I'm sorry about this.

Don't worry.
Come on. Come on.
I'm so sorry.

242

I'm gonna help you change,
all right? I won't look.
I promise.

243
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:09,097
Uh-huh.
Okay.

244
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:17,064
Okay, I looked.

245
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,443
Let's get this on.

246

to throw up, I promise.

here's Mr. Hamper.

get through to you

has just begun

Hey.
Hi.

269
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:06,548
How you feeling?

270
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:11,470
Uh, I mean,
I'm not about to enter
any pie-eating contests.

271
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:17,684
Did you clean up my bathroom,
or did I dream that?

272
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:23,565
Me? No.
Uh, the vomit elves came in.
And, uh, really adorable.

273
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:27,986
Really cute little things.
I mean, little caps
and little barf bags.

274
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:31,823
Well, thank you.

275
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:35,369
I mean, you really,
really went above and beyond.

276
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:38,663
Uh, no, please.
It wasn't a big deal.
You were very ladylike.

277
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:40,707
Hardly any "chunkage."

278
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:48,965
What's in the bag?
I got some, uh...

279
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:51,593
I got some movies
just in case you woke up.
Not in case you woke up.

280
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,095
I knew you were
going to wake up.

281
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:56,264
In case you woke up
in the middle of the night.

282
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:58,892
Yeah?
Anything good?

283
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:01,186
Uh, mostly animated
pornography from Japan.

284
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:04,606
And a little something
I like to watch too
when I feel sick.

285
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:06,942
Well, for me,
it's Annie Hall.

286
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:09,945

290
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:22,624
Are you feeling...
Is this crazy?
I mean, what are the odds?

291
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:24,626
Spooky.

292
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:31,174
No, she cannot
have my assistant.

293
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:33,718
Because I trained Carrie.
I like her.

294
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:37,973
Listen. Do we have to
settle this right now?
I'm with a... Person.

00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:43,061

Okay, I'll speak to you
tomorrow. Bye-bye.

I'm really, really sorry.

297
00:17:45,857 --> 00:17:47,566
Actually, I'm sorry.
I ate everything cool.

298
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,651
I just left you
a pile of sauce.

299
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:53,488
That's okay.
Actually, I'm the worst.
I eat off everybody's plate.

300
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:56,825
In fact, my friends,
they call me "the seagull."

303
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,206
Nice.

304
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,085
No, really,
I appreciate you being cool
about the phone thing,

305
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:10,422
because I once went on a date
with this guy who got so angry
I was on the phone

306
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:13,216
that he grabbed it out of
my hand, and he threw it
in the fish tank.

307
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:15,844
I would never do that.

308
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:19,055
What are your pet peeves?
What stresses you out?

309
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:21,725
Mm, I got...
And I'm only asking

310
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:25,145
because frankly
the men I meet are highly...

311
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:27,189
I date poodles basically.

312
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:30,192
And I'm really relaxed,
you know? Totally.

00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:31,693
[Cell Phone Ringing]
Son of a... Stop ringing.

314
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:32,944
I got it.

315
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:34,988
Let me do it.
Let me do it.

316
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:39,367
Hello?
Uh, no, she isn't.
May I take a message?

This is Ben.
I'm her houseboy/sex slave.

318
00:18:43,206 --> 00:18:46,333
Okay. You betcha.
Bye-bye.

319
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:48,877
Call your mother.

320
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:54,090
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
So you don't have
a cell phone,

321
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:57,010
a Blackberry,
a pager, nothing?
No.

322
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:59,471
Well, what if some
sudden crisis occurs,

323
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:01,681
like your father
has a heart attack
or something?

324
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,726
My father died
two years ago.
Oh, I'm sorry.

325
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,479
I just found out this morning,
so it's been a rough 24 hours.

326
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:09,648
You know, maybe I should
get a cell phone.
That's a good idea.

327
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:12,651
You're funny, Ben...
Wrightman.

328
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:14,653
Wrightman. Yeah.
Yeah.

329
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:16,488
You forgot my last name.
No, I just blanked.

330
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:20,075
I know why you forgot.
That's all right. I bet
when you talk to your friends,

331
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,869
you call me
Ben the schoolteacher,
am I right?

332
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:26,665
Well?
That's okay.

333
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:29,751
What do you call me
to your friends?

334
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:33,588
I call you Lindsey,

335
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:37,801
the vomit girl,
the puker, pukey.

336
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:40,178
Everyone says, "You going
out with pukey tonight?"
I'm like, "Yeah. Why?"

337
00:19:40,263 --> 00:19:43,848
"You wanna play video games
or something?"I'm like,"No,
I'm going out with pukey."

338
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:46,184
That's horrible.

339
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:51,398
Hey, anything I've said
about you would be
an understatement, really.

340
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:07,789
Hey, Lindsey!
Hi!

341
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:11,293
Hi.
Hi, I'm Ben
the schoolteacher.

342
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:13,295
Ian. Sarah.

343
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:15,297
Steve. Molly.
Oh, thanks
for having me.

344
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:18,133
Robin and Chris.
Welcome aboard.

345
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:20,927
Well, let's start
the interrogation.

346
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:22,929
No, no,
it's not like that.

347
00:20:23,014 --> 00:20:25,599
Here.
It's for the urine sample.

348
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:29,394
Shoot, I wish you would have
told me. I just took a whiz
in your bushes.

349
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:31,605
[All Laughing]
Do you want to...

350
00:20:31,689 --> 00:20:33,648
Show him the house.

351
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:37,027
I like it when it rains

352
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:41,364
It's always
on the windowpane

353
00:20:41,449 --> 00:20:45,744
Lindsey, this Ben guy
has got such a good vibe.
Good.

354
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:48,371
And he's nothing like
the guys you usually date.
I know.

355
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:49,789
[Sarah] and how cute is he?

356
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:52,042
Yeah? Well, I'm really glad
you guys feel this way,

357
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:55,462
because if you didn't,
I was gonna have to find
three new friends.

358
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:58,590
No, no, no, I really think
you've got something here.
Me too.

359
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:02,677
Yeah, but... Something's
not quite right.

360
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:05,138
Robin.
No, no, he's great.

361
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:07,682
He is. I love him.
He's a doll.

362
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:10,310
But he's not 22.
So?

363
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:14,314
So, where's he been?
Why is he still
on the market?

364
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:17,984
Um...
Maybe he hasn't found
the right person yet.

365
00:21:18,069 --> 00:21:20,487
Well, by now he should be
with the wrong person.

366
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:23,531
How has he not been
tranquilized and tagged?

367
00:21:24,742 --> 00:21:26,785
Let me get this straight.

368
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:29,329
You got two season tickets
behind the Red Sox dugout?

369
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:32,248
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
My uncle left them to me.
Behind the dugout?

370
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:34,918
Yeah. Well, not really behind,
like next to it.
Fifteen feet away.

371
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:38,963
You can see right into it
at a certain point.
It's pretty awesome.

372
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:44,761
Let me ask you this.

373
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:46,971
Do you find my wife
attractive at all?

374
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:49,474
'Cause we could work
something out.

375
00:21:53,396 --> 00:21:55,605
Well, do you?

376
00:21:56,399 --> 00:21:57,482
You know what
you need to do?

377
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:59,401
You need to
go to his apartment and
go through his things.

378
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:00,985
You need to go through
his closets, sofa cushions.

379
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,070
You need to
get on his computer.

380
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:05,407
And what exactly
am I looking for?

381
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:07,409
Anything that explains
why he's still single.

382
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:09,703
My company can run
a credit check on him.

383
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:12,038
You know, he could be
a deadbeat dad.

384
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:15,041
This is
an insane asylum.

385
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:20,296
So, uh, when they
wheeled out Ted Williams
at the All-Star Game...

386
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:24,592
I was there.
I was 10 feet
away from him.

387
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:28,763
Old men crying.
Tears.

388
00:22:30,391 --> 00:22:32,559
Tough old guys.

389
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:35,770
I even started
to lose it, you know.

390
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:38,440
I got a program.
I could show you.

391
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:43,153
If Lindsey ever breaks up
with you, I'll kill her.

392
00:22:43,237 --> 00:22:45,447
Lindsey, do you remember
that guy Maureen Durst
went out with?

393
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:49,659
Uh, sort of. Why?
[Molly]
Terry what's-his-name?

394
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:52,454
We all thought
he was great too.

395
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,748
Well, what happened?
Oh, my God. She went
to his apartment and...

396
00:22:54,832 --> 00:22:57,041
Shh. My story.
Stand by.

397
00:22:57,626 --> 00:23:00,044
She's at his place.
He's in the shower.

398
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:04,007
She wants to make the bed,
so she goes to the closet.
Guess what she finds.

399
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:06,134
Oh, I don't know.
What'd she find?

400
00:23:06,469 --> 00:23:10,430
Two large plastic bags
containing all of the hair
and nail clippings

401
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:12,390
from his entire life.

402
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:14,601
Eww!

403
00:23:14,685 --> 00:23:16,978
Eww!
That's a true story.

404
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:19,814
I'm telling you,
there is a reason
this Ben guy is still single.

405
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:27,781
Come on, baby

406
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:30,408
[Alarm Clock Ringing]

407
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:48,444
[No Audible Dialogue]

408
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:19,851
Come on!
I promised him we'd wait.

409
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:23,605
We're always
waiting for him.
I gave him my word.

410
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:25,899
You guys wait?

411
00:25:25,983 --> 00:25:27,901
Yeah.
Come on, man.

412
00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:29,903
Did anyone die
because you're here?
No, no, no.

413
00:25:29,987 --> 00:25:32,238
I got
another anesthesiologist
to cover for me.

414
00:25:32,323 --> 00:25:34,240
[Ben]
All right, are you ready?

415
00:25:34,325 --> 00:25:37,035
Hey, come on!
God.

416
00:25:46,629 --> 00:25:49,213
[Sniffs]

417
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:54,636
A new season.

418
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:58,848
A clean slate.
[Sniffs]

419
00:25:58,933 --> 00:26:01,809
Yep, this smells
like the year.

420
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:05,730
[Sizzles]

421
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,650
[Imitates Seagull Cawing]

422
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:11,110
Hey, you wanna
know something?
What?

423
00:26:11,195 --> 00:26:15,073
I like you.
I like you.

424
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:16,658
No, I mean,
I really like you.

425
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:19,661
I even wrote down
a list of all the things
I like about you.

426
00:26:20,955 --> 00:26:22,205
You made a list?

427
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:25,833
Yeah. I don't have it with me,
but I can remember it.

428
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:29,420
I'll skip down
because the first six
are all body parts.

429
00:26:29,672 --> 00:26:34,008
Uh, number seven:
I like that you drink
in the afternoon.

430
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:38,763
Number eight: I like sometimes
you talk out of the side
of your mouth a little bit.

431
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:41,516
And it's like...
It's like an adorable
stroke victim.

432
00:26:42,685 --> 00:26:43,977
I do?

433
00:26:44,061 --> 00:26:47,188
No, it's very cute.
It really is.
Uh, number nine.

434
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:50,608
You know, when you're getting
ready in the mirror, just when
you're about finished,

435
00:26:50,693 --> 00:26:52,402
you go like...

436
00:26:52,486 --> 00:26:56,364
It's so cute,
I wanna kill myself.
It's fantastic. Uh...

437
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:59,117
Hey, when's your break?
Hmm?

438
00:26:59,243 --> 00:27:02,537
For your school vacation.
When do you get off?
End of March.

439
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:05,039
That's when
you're in Baltimore, right?
Yeah.

440
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:06,791
Well, it's a really big deal
in my family,

441
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:10,211
because it's
my dad's birthday
and Easter,

442
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:12,964
and my sister's anniversary
all in the same week.

443
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:15,466
A cluster.
Yeah. Uh...

444
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:19,220
So, uh, how would
you like to come?

445
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:24,058
Ooh, too fast?
Too serious?

446
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:26,394
No, why?
Did I look like
I was just...

447
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:28,688
You were a little.
No, 'cause...

448
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:31,315
No, I... I made...
I have a previous commitment.

449
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,944
Oh, plans?
Yeah, yeah.

450
00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:37,572
Um, see, I didn't tell you
about it, 'cause I knew
you were gonna be away.

451
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:42,326
I figured it wouldn't matter,
but every year
during Easter vacation,

452
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:47,248
uh, me and my friends,
we go down to Florida.

453
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:52,837
You and your buddies
go down to Florida for
spring break? At your age?

454
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:55,798
No, no, no, not spring break.
Spring training
with the Red Sox.

455
00:27:55,883 --> 00:27:58,217
Oh, you get to train
with the Red Sox?

456
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:00,303
Are you allowed
to do that?

457
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:03,514
Well, we don't actually...
We watch the games.

458
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:05,516
Aren't those
just practice games?

459
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:08,019
Yeah, yeah, but there's
more to it than that.

460
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:11,522
We scout the players.
We... We say which players
they should keep,

461
00:28:11,607 --> 00:28:12,648
which they should
get rid of.

462
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:14,609
And the Red Sox
ask your opinion?

463
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:17,570
Well, not yet.

464
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:20,907
But if they ever do, uh...

465
00:28:20,991 --> 00:28:23,659
Okay, I've been
avoiding this.

466
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:29,457
There's something
you don't know about me.

467
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,793
Oh, God, here comes
the bag of hair.

468
00:28:34,505 --> 00:28:39,425
The thing is, uh,
I am a Red Sox fan.

469
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:45,431
Yeah?
No, I'm like a big,
big Red Sox fan.

470
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:48,392
I know.
I mean, I've been
to your apartment

471
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:53,981
and seen the Red Sox
dish towels and glasses
and the Yankee toilet paper.

472
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:57,443
It's like you live
in a gift shop.
It's worse.

473
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,323
See, when I was a kid,
I moved here from New Jersey,

474
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:04,408
and I didn't have
any friends or anything,

475
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:06,661
so my uncle Carl started
taking me to Fenway Park.

476
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:11,833
I just...
I got lost in the game.

477
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:14,335
I mean, the ballpark
and the people.

478
00:29:14,837 --> 00:29:16,671
The color, the sounds.

479
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,256
The smells.

480
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:22,927
And then he got cancer
and he died.

481
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:25,847
He left me
his season tickets.

482
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:27,849
And it's a passion.

483
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:31,894
I mean, it's a very,
very big part of my life.

484
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:37,024
And it's been a problem
with me and women.

485
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:39,569
Oh, ah,
I know those women.

486
00:29:39,653 --> 00:29:43,531
The "pay attention to me"
and "why aren't you
talking to me?"

487
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:47,827
Yeah. Exactly.
God, those women
are so pathetic.

488
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:50,830
Yeah, it's like,
"What are you getting
so worked up for?

489
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:53,499
I mean, you're not even
doing it, you're watching it."
Yeah.

490
00:29:53,584 --> 00:29:56,460
It's like,
"Hey, how about sometimes
I like to be 11 years old."

491
00:29:56,545 --> 00:29:57,587
Yeah.

492
00:29:57,671 --> 00:30:00,965
I like being part of something
that's bigger than me,
than I.

493
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:04,093
It's good for your soul
to invest in something
that you can't control.

494
00:30:04,678 --> 00:30:06,929
You're a romantic.

495
00:30:08,182 --> 00:30:09,223
Hmm?

496
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:14,103
You have a lyrical soul.
You can love under the best
and worst conditions.

497
00:30:14,188 --> 00:30:17,815
I don't know.
Well, yeah, yeah.

498
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:21,068
Yeah, I guess so.
Hey, uh...

499
00:30:24,281 --> 00:30:26,824
You took a really big chance
inviting me
to meet your family.

500
00:30:26,909 --> 00:30:30,745
[Sighs]
Now I'm gonna take a chance.
A big one.

501
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:44,508
Lindsey, will you
go to opening day with me?

502
00:30:47,221 --> 00:30:50,097
[Giggles]
Yes.

503
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:52,099
Yes. Yes!

504
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:54,602
You hear that?
She said yes!

505
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,729
[Imitating Jimmy Stewart]
Mary, look. Merry Christmas.

506
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:59,232
Clarence, look how
everyone showed up.
It's amaz...

507
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:02,318
We're going to opening day.
It's official. We're going.

508
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:04,111
Whoo-hoo!
Whoo!

509
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:08,699
[Gasps]
What did Dad do
to his hair?

510
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:11,577
I can't even look at him.
I know.

511
00:31:11,662 --> 00:31:13,829
How could you let him?

512
00:31:13,914 --> 00:31:17,875
He's 60. It's a big
psychological milestone.

513
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:21,087
He's struggling with it.
He thinks he looks good.

514
00:31:21,171 --> 00:31:24,382
[Barking]

515
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:27,677
Now don't start with me.
Listen, I forgot to tell you
that Donna...

516
00:31:27,761 --> 00:31:31,180
[Growling]
Stop it! Out!

517
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:33,683
Outside! Out.

518
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,644
I don't know
what's with him lately.

519
00:31:37,354 --> 00:31:39,814
Oh, I'm sorry.
I forgot to tell you.
Donna called.

520
00:31:40,357 --> 00:31:42,066
And they're
on their way.
Okay.

521
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,776
Good.

522
00:31:44,945 --> 00:31:46,862
[Both Chuckling]

523
00:31:46,947 --> 00:31:51,117
He is scaring the dog.
How can you stand it?

524
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:54,495
He fanned me with a magazine
for four years when I was
going through menopause.

525
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,998
I can put up with this.

526
00:31:57,332 --> 00:32:01,127
Go back in
and talk to him.
He misses you.

527
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:04,630
Okay. One more.

528
00:32:08,302 --> 00:32:11,887
[Man On TV]
Yeah, but do you see him ever
playing in a Yankee uniform?

529
00:32:11,972 --> 00:32:13,264
Hi.
Hey, kiddo.

530
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:15,266
Want a cookie?
No, thanks.

531
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,268
[Man On TV Continues]

532
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:21,063
Your mama says
you've been busy.
Ooh.

533
00:32:21,148 --> 00:32:24,817
No Red Sox fan
has forgotten last October
and Aaron Boone.

534
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:27,570
Hey, is this
about the Red Sox?
Yeah.

535
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:30,614
That next year
is the year.

536
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:33,242
Steve Levy is in Fort Myers
with some of the members
of the set

537
00:32:33,327 --> 00:32:35,119
known as Red Sox nation.

538
00:32:36,705 --> 00:32:39,373
Down here
in Fort Myers, Florida,
the story is always the same.

539
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:42,126
When the calendar page
flips to March...
[Continues]

540
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,252
[Dad] Are you interested?

541
00:32:43,587 --> 00:32:45,546
No, I just, you know...

542
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:49,133
I mean, I have a friend
who is interested.

543
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:52,261
Oh, the schoolteacher.

544
00:32:53,597 --> 00:32:56,098
When are we gonna meet
this future breakup?

545
00:32:56,183 --> 00:32:59,101
Thanks, Dad.
That's really encouraging.

546
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,896
Well, I thought
you would have
brought him with you.

547
00:33:02,564 --> 00:33:05,983
Well, you know,
he wanted to come.

548
00:33:06,068 --> 00:33:10,654
It's just that, um, well,
he has this tradition,
you know.

549
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:13,324
And it's very important
to him every...

550
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:17,703
The Sox are right there!
The Sox are right there!
[Continues Indistinct]

551
00:33:18,747 --> 00:33:21,665
Where do the Sox rank
in terms of importance
in your life?

552
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:24,502
I'd say Red Sox,
sex and breathing.

553
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:28,422
I have season tickets to
Fenway Park. I haven't missed
a game in 11 years.

554
00:33:28,507 --> 00:33:31,926
I love the Red Sox.
They're gonna win.
All the way this year, baby!

555
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,470
Do you have a job?
Do you work for a living?

556
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:37,306
Of course I do.
Yeah, I'm a teacher.
I mold young minds.

557
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:40,601
Can you help these guys out?
Can you believe
this asshole?

558
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:45,648
[Indistinct Yelling]

559
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,695
[Ben]
29th of May, Seattle,
all right?

560
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,447
You know what?
I gave it to the lady
down at the bakery.

561
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:56,242
Ben, all I got so far
is the 21 st and 22nd, man.

562
00:33:56,326 --> 00:33:58,702
We're only on May.
We've been here
for four hours.

563
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:00,162
Let's try to speed this up.

564
00:34:00,247 --> 00:34:02,832
30th of may,
we're still at Seattle.
Who wants a Sunday game?

565
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:05,000
These guys can have
whatever games they want.

566
00:34:05,085 --> 00:34:07,044
All I ask for
is the first Yankee game.

567
00:34:07,129 --> 00:34:10,548
You went to six
Yankee games last season,
you selfish pig bastard.

568
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:13,050
You got to go
to every great game.
Lowe's no-hitter.

569
00:34:13,135 --> 00:34:16,595
Your mother's hysterectomy?
I put her out for free,
remember?

570
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:20,724
She had insurance for that.
Attention, morons.

571
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:21,892
You went last year.

572
00:34:21,977 --> 00:34:24,770
You guys want Yankee tickets?
You wanna talk Yankee tickets?

573
00:34:24,855 --> 00:34:26,188
Yes.
Really.

574
00:34:26,273 --> 00:34:29,108
Okay, well, I wanna
see you dance for me.

575
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:31,652
[Overlapping Chatter]

576
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,654
You don't wanna dance?
I don't wanna embarrass you.

577
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:36,323
I don't wanna embarrass you.
I'll just take this.
Everyone just go.

578
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:39,869
I'll go talk to some kids
in the street. I see a little
bit there. That's pretty nice.

579
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,580
That's it. The doctor
is giving me something.

580
00:34:42,664 --> 00:34:45,541
The doctor is giving me
some magic tapping there.

581
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:48,294
Oh, I like that a lot.
Yeah, that's... Oh!

582
00:34:48,378 --> 00:34:51,797
All right, Little League,
you wanna go?
You want some of this?

583
00:34:51,882 --> 00:34:54,133
How's this, Ben?
This is dancing for tickets.
I'm dancing, Ben.

584
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:56,135
Troy, sit on
the beanbag, please.
Hey, I started, Ben.

585
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:58,387
Dance, dance, dance, dance

586
00:34:58,472 --> 00:35:00,014
Gerard, I guess
you don't want them, huh?

587
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:02,641
This is worth tickets.
I'm not dancing.
This is totally stupid, man.

588
00:35:02,726 --> 00:35:05,519
Fine. Hey, hold out
for the Royals, huh?

589
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:11,817
You are on
a total power trip,
you know that, man?

590
00:35:12,194 --> 00:35:13,611
This is totally
ridiculous, man.

591
00:35:13,695 --> 00:35:15,279
I was dancing first,
remember?

592
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:17,948
You said dance,
I started dancing.

593
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:21,452
You call that Yankee dancing?
No, no, that's like
Devil Ray dancing, okay?

594
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:23,996
That's Devil Ray.
I'm talking about
Yankee dancing.

595
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:28,000
That's what I'm talking about.
Yeah, get into it. Yeah!
How bad do you want it?

596
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,753
Yeah, that's nice.
I love it. Come on in.
[Knocking]

597
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:34,048

Hey, what are you
doing here?

603
00:35:45,602 --> 00:35:47,436
I thought you weren't
coming in until tomorrow.
You look fantastic.

604
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:50,189
I got in last night.
You know Troy,
Kevin and Gerard.

605
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:53,025
Everyone else,
this is Lindsey.
Hi.

606
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:54,109
Hi, Linds.

607
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:57,988
Party?
No, it's draft day.

608
00:35:58,073 --> 00:36:01,534
This is the day we organize
the whole season, who gets
to go to what game with me.

609
00:36:01,618 --> 00:36:03,786
But don't worry.
You're still going
to opening day.

610
00:36:04,204 --> 00:36:07,957
Yeah, thank you.
Can I talk to you about
something really quickly?

611
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:10,334
Sure, yeah, no problem.
Quick break, everybody.

612

There's some nice
Pakistani cold cuts there,
courtesy of Mrs. Segal.

613
00:36:13,463 --> 00:36:16,006
I still don't think
they're worth
two Sunday tickets.

614
00:36:16,091 --> 00:36:17,925
Whoo-hoo!
Hey! Hey!

615
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:21,762
Come here.

616
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,764
Wait, I got you something.

617
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:27,101
I set aside
some great games
for you too.

618
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:30,646
Hmm? For when we go
to the games together.

619
00:36:31,106 --> 00:36:32,273
Thanks.

620
00:36:32,482 --> 00:36:34,608
It's what
the players wear.

621
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:37,236
It's authentic.

622
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:43,200
I gotta be honest.
This is getting me hot.

623
00:36:43,285 --> 00:36:48,539
Listen. Um, you know,
I saw you on ESPN.

624
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:50,666
Oh. We looked like
morons, didn't we?

625
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:54,920
Uh, yeah, yeah, total.
Not you so much, but...

626
00:36:55,005 --> 00:36:57,715
Well, it's very hot,
you know. It's Florida.

627
00:36:57,799 --> 00:36:59,800
[Chuckles]
You start seeing things.

628
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:03,679
Um, you know, Ben,

629
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:09,310
I didn't realize how big
this Red Sox thing is
with you.

630
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:12,062
What?
Hey, I told you.

631
00:37:12,147 --> 00:37:14,648
See, this is...
This always happens.
Every time I...

632
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:18,652
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
don't jump off a building.
We're just talking.

633
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:24,408
Sorry. Knee jerk.
[Troy] Ben, come on, man.
The cold cuts are gone.

634
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:27,244
Let's go in there.
Two minutes!

635
00:37:28,705 --> 00:37:30,873
Wow. I really hit
a nerve there, didn't I?

636
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:33,500
Uh...
[Clears Throat]
Yeah.

637
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:35,169
Come here.

638
00:37:36,338 --> 00:37:38,213
Thank you.

639
00:37:38,298 --> 00:37:42,301
I think there's
a better approach
to this whole Red Sox thing.

640
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:45,137
Really?
Yeah. After all,
if I want this promotion,

641
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:48,474
I am going to
have to push myself
really hard this summer.

642
00:37:48,558 --> 00:37:54,188
And I've never really been
very good at servicing myself,
my job and a relationship.

643
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,940
Wait, wait.
We're not breaking up,
are we?

644
00:37:57,025 --> 00:37:59,818
No, no,
this is a good thing.
Okay.

645
00:37:59,903 --> 00:38:01,945
You're gonna be
so consumed with all of this

646
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:04,073
that you won't
feel neglected all summer.

647
00:38:04,157 --> 00:38:06,158
No, no, yeah,
I'm not gonna
feel neglected.

648
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:08,744
And I won't feel guilty
for having to do my job.

649
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:10,496
Yeah, you shouldn't.

650
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:13,916
So, what I'm saying is,
I think this is perfect.

651
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,378
[Chuckles]
All right. Go, Sox!

652
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:20,422
Two, three, four
Tessie

653
00:38:20,507 --> 00:38:22,466
Nuff Ced McGreevy shouted

654
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,885
We're not here
to mess around

655
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:28,347
We got 'em right here, folks.
Come on down. Cut your deficit
and balance your budget.

656
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:31,141
Hear the crowd roar
to your sound

657
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:33,143
Programs here!
Get your programs here!

658
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:35,729
Don't blame us
if we ever doubt you

659
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:38,565
You know we couldn't live
without you

660
00:38:39,234 --> 00:38:46,365
Tessie, you are
the only, only, only

661
00:38:48,952 --> 00:38:51,495
Hi. Hi.
Hey.

662
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:55,791
[Man]
Peanuts! Cracker Jacks!

663
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:59,044
Who wants peanuts?
Who wants Cracker Jacks?

664
00:38:59,129 --> 00:39:02,297
Peanuts! Cracker Jacks!
Who wants...

665
00:39:02,382 --> 00:39:04,550
It's unbelievable, right?
You can't even believe how...

666
00:39:04,634 --> 00:39:07,553
Look, right here, go.
This is it.
Thank you.

667
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:11,348
Is this amazing?
Is this crazy? Would you
look at these seats?

668
00:39:11,433 --> 00:39:13,183
They're...
They're very red.

669
00:39:13,268 --> 00:39:15,686
No, I mean, their proximity
to the field.
This is Fenway Park.

670
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:16,812
Oh.

671
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:18,689
You can't buy these seats.
You have to,
like, inherit them.

672
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:21,859
It's like a guy
offered me $100,000
for these once.

673
00:39:21,985 --> 00:39:25,028
And you didn't sell them?
No, if I ever need
the money that bad,

674
00:39:25,113 --> 00:39:28,031
I can always call up
a rich old lady and give her
some sweet lovin', you know?

675
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:29,992
That's what I'm all about.
Hey, what's up, Al?

676
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,661
How you doing?
I'm on dialysis.

677
00:39:32,746 --> 00:39:35,372
Right on, buddy.
Hey, Al, this is Lindsey.

678
00:39:35,457 --> 00:39:37,708
Hi. Al Waterman.
Here, have a sponge.

679
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:39,877
Thank you.
Al is the first guy
I ever met

680
00:39:39,961 --> 00:39:41,879
at my first
Red Sox game ever.
Really?

681
00:39:41,963 --> 00:39:45,007
Yeah, he's aged horribly.
Hey, the Belnaps.

682
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:47,801
This is Artie. Viv.
This is Lindsey.
Hello.

683
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:49,303
Hi, Lindsey.
Hello.

684
00:39:49,429 --> 00:39:51,638
Been divorced 20 years,
still share the seats.
Really.

685
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:53,599
Hey, Ben.
Sheri!

686
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:56,310
How you doing?
Where's Teresa?
She's right here.

687
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:59,021
Oh, my God.
What happened?
You look fantastic!

688
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:02,232
I lost 200 pounds.
I had my stomach stapled shut.

689
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:05,319
A doctor
or you did it yourself?
Oh, real funny.

690
00:40:05,987 --> 00:40:07,404
Hey!

691
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:11,700
This is quite a little group
you have here.

692
00:40:11,785 --> 00:40:14,661
Well, it's
my summer family.

693
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:18,707
[Boy]
For the land of the free

694
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:25,547
And the home of the brave

695
00:40:25,632 --> 00:40:29,635
[Crowd Cheering]
[Announcer] Let's hear it
for Jordan Leandre.

696
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:34,181
Ladies and gentlemen,
throwing out
the first ball today,

697
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:37,226
New England's own
Stephen King.

698
00:40:37,602 --> 00:40:40,354
[Crowd Cheering]

699
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:42,564
[Announcer]
Right down the middle.

700
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:49,488
Did you tell Schuyler?
Okay, all right, listen.

701
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:53,033
Um, excuse me.
What time is the game over?

702
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:55,202
Uh, it's not like
a Broadway musical

703
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:56,495
where it ends with
a big Hawaiian number.

704
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:59,039
It's like you're missing
all the ambience
and all the fun.

705
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:01,041
I know.
The players
are right there.

706
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:04,086
I have a meeting at 5:30
and had to leave work at noon
to meet you here,

707
00:41:04,212 --> 00:41:06,880
so my people
aren't prepared.
Right. Okay.

708
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:11,802
You know what?
I left work early,

709
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:14,555
so you're gonna have to
figure it out for yourself,
and I'll call you later.

710
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:16,265
[Announcer]
Wakefield.

711
00:41:23,398 --> 00:41:24,439
[Groans]

712
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:28,402
That's a foul.

713
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:31,446
What makes that a foul?
See that foul pole there?

714
00:41:31,531 --> 00:41:34,032
That's Pesky's Pole.
That's this guy
Johnny Pesky.

715
00:41:44,252 --> 00:41:45,377
Yeah!

716
00:41:59,893 --> 00:42:02,561
Hey, what are you doing
on Saturday?

717
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:04,605
Mm, you tell me.

718
00:42:07,025 --> 00:42:09,192
You know what's really great
about baseball?
Hmm?

719
00:42:09,277 --> 00:42:11,111
You can't fake it.

720
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:14,031
Anything else in life,
you don't have to
be great in.

721
00:42:14,115 --> 00:42:16,199
Business, music, art...
I mean, you can get lucky.

722
00:42:16,326 --> 00:42:18,660
Really?
Yeah, you can fool everyone
for a while, you know?

723
00:42:18,745 --> 00:42:20,662
It's like...
Not... Not baseball.

724
00:42:20,747 --> 00:42:22,789
You can either
hit a curveball
or you can't.

725
00:42:22,916 --> 00:42:25,667
That's the way
it works, you know?
Hmm.

726
00:42:25,752 --> 00:42:30,339
You could have a lucky day,
sure, but you can't have
a lucky career.

727
00:42:30,632 --> 00:42:33,467
It's a little like math.
It's orderly.

728
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:36,845
Win or lose, it's fair.
It all adds up.

729
00:42:37,138 --> 00:42:41,141
It's, like, not as confusing
or as ambiguous as, uh...

730
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:43,226
Life?
Yeah.

731
00:42:44,187 --> 00:42:46,480
It's... It's safe.

732
00:42:49,776 --> 00:42:51,985
Oh, yeah! Yeah!

733
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:57,157
[Whooping]

734
00:42:57,659 --> 00:42:58,784
Hey.
Hi.

735
00:42:58,868 --> 00:43:00,369
What, did you buy out
the bookstore?

736
00:43:00,453 --> 00:43:02,788
Actually, I bought
every book they had
on the Red Sox,

737
00:43:02,872 --> 00:43:05,499
because I'm tired of being
the most ignorant person here.

738
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:08,835
Now who is
Carl Yaz-a-strezem...

739
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:12,214
[All] Yastrzemski.
[Mouthing Words]

740
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:14,800
She's not a genius,
this one.
No.

741
00:43:15,343 --> 00:43:20,222
Johnny Damon!
You got the sweetest ass
in the league!

742
00:43:22,684 --> 00:43:24,267
Very nice.

743
00:43:26,813 --> 00:43:30,065
[Scoffs]
Do you believe in this?
"The Curse of the Bambino"?

744
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:31,692
Hey, that's not funny.
That's enough of that.

745
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:33,193
But Babe Ruth
was the Bambino.

746
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:35,195
That's right.
He played for the Red Sox.

747
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:37,823
They were great.
I mean, they were
the Yankees.

748
00:43:37,907 --> 00:43:41,535
They won the World Series
in 1912, 1915,

749
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:43,620
1916, 1918.

750
00:43:43,705 --> 00:43:46,123
They were royalty.
The elite.

751
00:43:46,207 --> 00:43:49,251
Al should know.
He was there actually.
He's 136 years old.

752
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:53,964
He looks great for his age.
1919, their miserable,
greedy pig of a boss

753
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:57,467
decides to sell Babe Ruth
to the Yankees to finance
a Broadway musical.

754
00:43:57,552 --> 00:44:00,220
No, no, Nanette.
I would never ever
see that piece of crap.

755
00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:04,891
And since 1918,
the Red Sox have not won
a World Series.

756
00:44:04,976 --> 00:44:07,227
Yeah, the Yankees
have won 26.

757
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:11,231
And the thing is
the Sox don't just lose,
they raise it to an art form.

758
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:13,650
Tony C.,
best young player in baseball,

759
00:44:13,735 --> 00:44:17,612
catches one in the eye at 22,
he's finished at 26.

760
00:44:17,697 --> 00:44:20,866
Armbrister runs into
Carlton Fisk,
costs us the Series.

761
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:22,951
Bucky friggin' Dent.
[Viv Groans]

762
00:44:23,036 --> 00:44:26,038
You remember the time
Roger Moret went catatonic?

763
00:44:26,122 --> 00:44:28,248
The grounds crew
had to carry him out
in a wheelbarrow.

764
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:30,250
Buckner.
[All Groan]

765
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:32,669
Grady little sticking
with Pedro
in the eighth inning.

766
00:44:32,754 --> 00:44:36,423
Ooh, stop it.
You're killing me here.

767
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:39,801
And that, milady,
is the Curse of the Bambino.

768
00:44:39,886 --> 00:44:42,512
[Announcer]
Number 19, Gabe Kapler.

769
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:54,816
Okay, I'm ready.
Let's go meet Mom and Dad.

770
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,486
[Scoffs]

771
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:00,697
Nothing.

772
00:45:00,782 --> 00:45:04,409
A laugh? A giggle?
This is not
a man's closet.

773
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:07,079
What do you mean?
You have one pair
of dress shoes.

774
00:45:07,163 --> 00:45:09,873
You're like a man-boy.
Half man, half boy.

775
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:12,459
You should see the way
my sister's husband dresses.

776
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:16,755
He had a professional
come in and do his closet.
It's like suit, suit, suit...

777
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:19,091
All right, okay, okay.
I see what this is all about.

778
00:45:19,175 --> 00:45:21,968
You want your parents
to like me more than they
like your brother-in-law.

779
00:45:23,179 --> 00:45:25,430
No, it's not...
Yes!

780
00:45:26,474 --> 00:45:31,478
[Sighs]
Is it so horrible that
I want my parents to like you?

781
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:37,150
Okay. I think we have
enough stuff in this closet.
We can fool 'em.

782
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:39,152
[Mom]
He looks like a skunk.

783
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:41,238
You're the one that told me
to grow it out.

784
00:45:41,322 --> 00:45:44,908
Well, what else could I say?
It looked ridiculous on you.
A man your age...

785
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:47,702
Now, I understand
that you're a teacher, right?
You were?

786
00:45:47,787 --> 00:45:49,496
Yes, for 27 years.

787
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:52,082
And, okay, now you're
the principal, right?
Mm-hmm.

788
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:55,168
And you...
Did you ever tell me
what your dad does?

789
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:59,422
I sell golf carts.
Wow. Okay, that gives us
nothing to talk about.

790
00:45:59,507 --> 00:46:01,424
I don't really know much
about it.

791
00:46:01,509 --> 00:46:04,553
That's funny,
'cause every other guy
she's gone out with

792
00:46:04,637 --> 00:46:06,721
has tried to get
a free golf cart
out of me.

793
00:46:06,806 --> 00:46:10,225
No, I like golf. Great sport.
It's just I don't really
get out much, you know?

794
00:46:10,476 --> 00:46:11,852
We love it.
Yeah?

795
00:46:11,936 --> 00:46:14,062
They play all the time.

796
00:46:14,147 --> 00:46:16,648
We tried to get on
the country club here,
but it's very difficult.

797
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:20,235
It's almost impossible.
I had to call the manufacturer
of my golf carts,

798
00:46:20,361 --> 00:46:23,113
a guy named
Dave Johnson, and said...
Jensen.

799
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:25,407
No, Dave... Dave Johnson.
Jensen.

800
00:46:25,533 --> 00:46:28,535
Jensen?
Hi. Sorry we're late. He was
watching the Red Sox game.

801
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:31,163
How'd they do?
No, no.
La, la, la, la, la!

802
00:46:31,247 --> 00:46:33,165
Help me! Help me!
Help me!
What's wrong?

803
00:46:33,249 --> 00:46:36,209
Oh, help me! Help me!
Help me! La la la la!

804
00:46:36,294 --> 00:46:38,670
[Man, Indistinct]
La la la la.
La la la la.

805
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:40,672
[Making Noises]
Okay. Okay.

806
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:43,049
It was awesome.
Struck out the side.

807
00:46:43,134 --> 00:46:46,344
Okay, it stopped.
It stopped. Stop it!
Stop it! Stop it!

808
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:50,473
Whew!
Um...

809
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:53,685
Thank you.
Yeah. Ben tapes
the Red Sox games,

810
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:55,645
so he doesn't wanna
know the score.

811
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:58,815
And he can't
cover his own ears 'cause
he's got lobster fingers,

812
00:46:58,900 --> 00:46:59,900
so I do it.

813
00:47:00,985 --> 00:47:02,903
That's sweet.

814
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:10,577
Hey, how'd it go last night?
Fabulous.

815
00:47:10,745 --> 00:47:11,995
Mr. Myerson
wants to see you.

816
00:47:13,122 --> 00:47:16,666
Oh, God. If one of
the windows would open,
I would jump.

817
00:47:16,751 --> 00:47:18,585
And your mom's
on line one.

818
00:47:20,004 --> 00:47:24,507
Hi, Mom. Hi.
Listen, where are you?
Can I call you back?

819
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:28,386
What? You had
a 10:00 a.m. Flight.

820
00:47:32,058 --> 00:47:34,559
My Ben?
Yes, he has been great.

821
00:47:34,644 --> 00:47:37,771
He took us out to breakfast.
Right now he's washing
your father's balls.

822
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:39,022
What?

823
00:47:41,484 --> 00:47:43,193
Here's one.
Thanks, Ben.

824
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:45,820
He got us a 10:00 a.m.
Tee time at the country club.

825
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:48,615
How?

826
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:52,786
One of his student's fathers
has something to do
with the sprinklers.

827
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:55,121
Can I talk to him
for a second?
Oh, sure.

828
00:47:55,206 --> 00:47:56,998
Benny? Lindsey.

829
00:47:57,083 --> 00:47:59,167
Oh, thanks.
Hi, Linds.

830
00:48:00,002 --> 00:48:02,128
Hey, what are you doing?

831
00:48:02,463 --> 00:48:03,797
Took a sick day.

832
00:48:05,633 --> 00:48:08,843
All right.
Well, I'll see you
tonight then.

833
00:48:08,928 --> 00:48:11,054
All right. Bye-bye.
Honey...

834
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:15,267
Uh, sweetheart,
don't talk in my backswing.

835
00:48:15,393 --> 00:48:18,061
Well, you were
lined up wrong.
I wasn't lined up, I...

836
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:20,522
Please, don't talk
in my backswing. You know
better than that.

837
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:23,900
Just take a mulligan.
Lighten up.

838
00:48:23,985 --> 00:48:26,569
He's so short with me.
I know. I know.
But you know what?

839
00:48:26,696 --> 00:48:29,406
You talked in his backswing.
Did you talk in his backswing?
Yes, I did.

840
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:32,033
Don't even look at him.
Look this way. Let him swing.
Okay.

[Crowd Cheering]

842
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:48,758
Where it began

843
00:48:49,802 --> 00:48:51,928
Manny! Manny! Manny!

844
00:48:52,013 --> 00:48:53,179
I can't begin to know when

845
00:48:54,432 --> 00:48:57,892
But then I know
it's growin' strong

846
00:49:02,106 --> 00:49:03,898
Wasn't the spring

847
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:08,445
And spring
became the summer

848
00:49:09,697 --> 00:49:12,866
Who'd have believed
you'd come along

849
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:18,997
Hand

850
00:49:20,583 --> 00:49:23,168
Touching hands

Reaching out

852
00:49:27,757 --> 00:49:29,549
Touching me

853
00:49:30,551 --> 00:49:34,721
Touching you

854
00:49:35,056 --> 00:49:38,058
Sweet Caroline
buh, buh, buh

855
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:42,979
Good times never
seemed so good

856
00:49:43,064 --> 00:49:45,774
So good, so good, so good

857
00:49:46,317 --> 00:49:48,651
I've been inclined

858
00:49:51,072 --> 00:49:57,827
To believe they never would
and now I

859
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:02,248
Oh.
[Breathing Heavily]

860
00:50:10,049 --> 00:50:13,134
[Man] She handled a project
for a food service company
like yours a few months ago.

861
00:50:13,803 --> 00:50:17,972
Gave them a model
predicting the impact
of every possibility.

862
00:50:18,057 --> 00:50:19,974
Sounds like what I need.
Morning.

863
00:50:20,059 --> 00:50:22,060
You'll love her.
This lady is a dynamo.

864
00:50:22,144 --> 00:50:24,437
Unstop... pable.

865
00:50:28,818 --> 00:50:32,570
[Clears Throat]
When she wakes up,
I wanna see her.

866
00:50:32,655 --> 00:50:34,656
Well, let's go
for a coffee.

867
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:37,826
You know
what's happening here?
You're being colonized.

868
00:50:37,952 --> 00:50:41,121
What?
Colonized. It's like...
It's like in the old days.

869
00:50:41,664 --> 00:50:45,208
When the French
and the English would go
into Asia and Africa,

870
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:46,584
and they'd
raise their flags

871
00:50:46,669 --> 00:50:49,712
and they'd
impose their culture
and they'd colonize.

872
00:50:49,797 --> 00:50:53,508
It's like, Sarah, when you
cut your hair off because
that guy liked short hair.

873
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:55,593
Wait a minute.
I mean, you guys are married.

874
00:50:55,678 --> 00:50:58,680
Isn't that a part of it,
accommodating each other?

875
00:50:58,931 --> 00:51:01,141
You know, how many kids
are we gonna have?

876
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:04,727
Where are we gonna live?
What pizza place
are we gonna order from?

877
00:51:04,812 --> 00:51:06,855
Doesn't it require
some pliability?

878
00:51:06,939 --> 00:51:10,525
Because maybe that's something
I've been lacking in my life.

879
00:51:10,985 --> 00:51:12,694
Isn't it affecting your work?

880
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:15,738
No, not so much.

881
00:51:15,823 --> 00:51:17,740
You know what
I just realized?

882
00:51:17,825 --> 00:51:20,160
You're rooting
for her relationship to fail.

883
00:51:20,244 --> 00:51:21,703
No.
What?

884
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:23,955
That's right.
Why would I do that?

885
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:26,499
Never mind.

886
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:30,003
No. No, come on,
tell me.

887
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:37,302
All right. You and Lindsey
are both very competitive,
especially with each other.

888
00:51:37,386 --> 00:51:40,763
She's more competitive
than I am.
I am not.

889
00:51:40,848 --> 00:51:43,308
And when you were both
starting out, you were
the more successful one.

890
00:51:43,392 --> 00:51:46,811
But now Lindsey's career
has skyrocketed,
so she's more successful.

891
00:51:46,896 --> 00:51:50,106
But you've had
the personal success,
the marriage.

892
00:51:50,191 --> 00:51:53,485
And if Lindsey
gets that too, then she's
definitely the winner,

893
00:51:53,569 --> 00:51:55,487
so you're rooting
against her.

894
00:51:57,990 --> 00:52:01,826
[Gasps]
Oh, my God.
What did I do?

895
00:52:02,703 --> 00:52:04,787
What the...
That's it.

896
00:52:04,872 --> 00:52:07,373

not coming here anymore.

about this promotion thing?

906
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:44,702
Uh, next month.

907
00:52:44,787 --> 00:52:49,832
Oh, cool. I just wanted to
know how long I gotta put up
with this at the ball games.

Ben, this is my third game
this week.
Oh, no, I know that.

909
00:52:53,546 --> 00:52:56,506
And I always have to leave
at 6:00 to be here on time.

910
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:59,842
And then we don't get home
till 11:00, then you and I
go at it all night,

911
00:52:59,927 --> 00:53:01,844
and then that's
all time lost.

Really?

Well, when I say lost,
I mean it's time
that I have to make up.

got my ass chewed out...

There was a scary moment
though in this one
in the sixth inning,

when Miguel Tejada
hit a vicious foul ball
off Mike Myers

Why?
Because of this?

No, because I'm becoming
someone that I hate.

and poof, their entire
prior life just vanishes.

00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:19,125
The work you did for us
was brilliant.

971
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:22,378
Oh. Well,
I really appreciate
you saying that.

972
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:25,757
Uh, Patrick Lyons,
this is Carrie.
Nice to see you again.

973
00:56:25,841 --> 00:56:27,842
Nice to see you.
Excuse me.

974
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:31,763
You know, they're really
very lucky to have you here.

975
00:56:31,847 --> 00:56:37,101
Oh, I feel
the same way to be here.
I feel very lucky.

976
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:42,064
Here, I got it.

977
00:56:42,149 --> 00:56:44,817
Um, thank you.
You're welcome.

978
00:56:44,902 --> 00:56:49,322
I was, um, just trying
to get comfortable.

979
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:52,492
Well, don't get
too comfortable,
you might fall asleep.

980
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:55,828
[People Cheering]
[Ben] Come on! Come on!
Use your brain!

981
00:56:55,913 --> 00:56:58,831
Use your brain!
Oh, they're in the lead.
We almost have an answer.

982
00:56:58,916 --> 00:57:00,833
Who's ahead?
Oh, Tammy's in the lead.

983
00:57:00,918 --> 00:57:03,503
We might have a winner!
We might have a winner
right here!

984
00:57:03,921 --> 00:57:07,840
Tammy won!
37' 2", the Green Monster.

985
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:10,218
Audrey, I'm very sorry,
but you can have
our home game.

986
00:57:10,302 --> 00:57:11,302
Don, what does she win?

987
00:57:11,386 --> 00:57:14,847
Excuse me.
It's a little loud,
don't you think?

988
00:57:16,141 --> 00:57:18,726
Sorry, Mr. Ennis.
The kids' drugs
just kicked in.

989
00:57:18,811 --> 00:57:20,853
[All Laughing]
[Mr. Ennis] Oh, ha ha.

990
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:23,773
Teenage drug use.
That's great fodder
for comedy.

991
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:30,530
[Mouthing Words]
[Students Laugh]

992
00:57:31,323 --> 00:57:33,157
All right, you guys.
We're almost out of time.
Pack up.

993
00:57:33,242 --> 00:57:35,952
Remember, we got a big test
next Tuesday, so St...
[Students Groaning]

994
00:57:36,036 --> 00:57:39,330
Hey, back off!
Back, back, back, you animals!
[Imitates Whip Whipping]

995
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:44,961
Back! Hey, one of the
10 problems on your handout
will be on the test.

996
00:57:45,045 --> 00:57:48,714
I'm not gonna tell you
which one, so you're gonna
have to learn all of them.

997
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:49,882
Seven.

998
00:57:49,967 --> 00:57:53,010
[Mouthing Word]
Seven.

999
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:55,721
[Mouthing Word]

1000
00:57:59,184 --> 00:58:02,311
[Bell Rings]
All right,
study, you maniacs.

1001
00:58:02,396 --> 00:58:06,482
Remember, this Saturday is
fall tryouts for next spring's
J.V. Baseball.

1002
00:58:06,567 --> 00:58:09,610
Just to avoid the confusion
we had last year,
let me say this year

1003
00:58:09,695 --> 00:58:12,405
we're looking
for good players.
Hi.

1004
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:14,448
Hey.

1005
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:18,578
How are you doing?
I have very exciting news.
I couldn't wait to tell you.

1006
00:58:18,954 --> 00:58:20,621
You got the promotion.
No, no.

1007
00:58:20,706 --> 00:58:23,499
Mr. Myerson did call me
into his office
right after we spoke.

1008
00:58:23,584 --> 00:58:24,584
I was trying
to play it cool.

1009
00:58:25,043 --> 00:58:27,461
But between you and me,
I was ready to wash his balls.

1010
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:30,339
Yeah, see, that joke's
not fun for me.

1011
00:58:30,424 --> 00:58:33,050
[Giggles]
I'm sorry.
Let me explain.

1012
00:58:33,385 --> 00:58:36,387
There is this European company
that we're trying to make
a deal with, okay?

1013
00:58:36,471 --> 00:58:38,389
And what they do...
You know what?

1014
00:58:38,473 --> 00:58:41,434
The point is
they're sending me to Paris
to close the deal.

1015
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:44,645
Wow!
And I am taking vous.

1016
00:58:44,813 --> 00:58:46,564
Moi?
Oui!

1017
00:58:46,648 --> 00:58:48,858
Taking me to Paris?

1018
00:58:49,902 --> 00:58:51,485
Oh, this is gonna
be so great.

1019
00:58:51,570 --> 00:58:54,906
Okay, I'm gonna cash in
my first-class ticket
and get two seats.

1020
00:58:54,990 --> 00:58:58,618
All you have to do,
Mr. Wrightman,
is call in sick tomorrow,

1021
00:58:58,702 --> 00:59:01,245
and we're on our way.
Wait, it's tomorrow?

1022
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:03,497
Mm-hmm.
This weekend?
It's now?

1023
00:59:03,582 --> 00:59:06,042
Yeah, we'll fly back
Sunday afternoon,
but with the time change,

1024
00:59:06,126 --> 00:59:08,085
you'll be back at work
on Monday morning.

1025
00:59:11,673 --> 00:59:15,343
Oh, yeah, uh,
I... I gotta be honest.

1026
00:59:15,427 --> 00:59:19,555
This isn't
the best weekend for me.
I'm kind of swamped.

1027
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:21,682
Oh, no.
Do you have a lot of work?

1028
00:59:21,767 --> 00:59:25,019
Uh, we're two games
out of first,
with three weeks left.

1029
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:28,022
Seattle's coming in
this weekend, and, I mean...

1030
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:30,107
This is when
they need me.

1031
00:59:30,442 --> 00:59:31,984
They need you?

1032
00:59:34,029 --> 00:59:36,697
Wait a second.
I was just thinking
about it. That's all.

1033
00:59:36,782 --> 00:59:38,157
A tip, Ben.

1034
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:42,078
When your girlfriend says,
"Let's go to Paris
for the weekend," you go.

1035
00:59:42,162 --> 00:59:44,622
All right, all right.
I'll go. I'll go.

1036
00:59:44,790 --> 00:59:48,834
You'll go? You know what?
I have a better idea.
I think I'll take him.

1037
00:59:54,675 --> 00:59:56,175
Hey. Just slow down
a second, okay?

1038
00:59:56,259 --> 00:59:58,928
Just go and enjoy
your ball game.

1039
00:59:59,012 --> 01:00:02,515
You know, this is
the second day in a row
you've snapped at me.

1040
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:04,934
I'm late.
Fine. Go.

1041
01:00:06,061 --> 01:00:07,520
No, Ben.

1042
01:00:09,147 --> 01:00:10,606
I'm late.

1043
01:00:16,530 --> 01:00:17,863
How... How late?

1044
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:21,367
Um, a week and a half.

1045
01:00:22,828 --> 01:00:25,204
Okay. That's not
that late. Right?

1046
01:00:25,414 --> 01:00:27,331
No. It is for me.

1047
01:00:27,791 --> 01:00:31,502
Okay. Well, you know what?
I mean, we're not
the first people to...

1048
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:34,296
To, you know... To... 'Cause,
you know, when two people...

1049
01:00:34,381 --> 01:00:36,590
You know.
Deep breaths, Ben.

1050
01:00:36,675 --> 01:00:40,261
[Clears Throat]
Yeah. Why...
Why didn't you say something?

1051
01:00:40,345 --> 01:00:42,722
Why? So we could
both freak out?

1052
01:00:43,098 --> 01:00:45,933
I mean, I wanted to wait
for the right moment.

1053
01:00:46,018 --> 01:00:48,310
And then when this trip
came up, I thought,

1054
01:00:48,395 --> 01:00:50,521
we'll go to Paris,
and I'll tell you there,

1055
01:00:50,605 --> 01:00:52,732
because that did
seem special.

1056
01:00:52,816 --> 01:00:54,817
But, no, you don't see us
tangled up in the sheets

1057
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:56,652
with the Eiffel Tower
in the window.

1058
01:00:56,737 --> 01:01:00,865
You see the Mariners
are coming and Pedro's
pitching Friday night.

1059
01:01:00,949 --> 01:01:02,867
[Mumbles]
Saturday.
Schilling's on Friday.

1060
01:01:02,951 --> 01:01:06,120
Look. I...
I admit I should have
reacted differently.

1061
01:01:06,204 --> 01:01:07,580
If I ever build
a time machine,

1062
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:09,248
that's the first place
I'm going back to.

1063
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:11,625
I'll be like,
"Paris, whoo! I'm in."

1064
01:01:11,710 --> 01:01:14,420
Uh, I...
Really, I'm sorry.

1065
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:16,630
That's all right.

1066
01:01:16,715 --> 01:01:19,300
[Sighs]
But I have a 4:00 flight
that I have to catch.

1067
01:01:19,384 --> 01:01:22,344
All right. I can pack my bags.
We can put some stuff
together. We can make this.

1068
01:01:22,429 --> 01:01:25,431
No, it's okay.
The trip is already off
to a weird start.

1069
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:27,349
Y...
Let's just talk about it
when I get back.

1070
01:01:27,434 --> 01:01:28,517
You sure?
Yeah.

1071
01:01:28,602 --> 01:01:29,602
You're sure?
Yeah.

1072
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:31,604
I could tell them
I'm leaving right now.

1073
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:33,606
We're going.
No. It's okay.

1074
01:01:34,608 --> 01:01:35,775
You gonna be all right?

1075
01:01:37,903 --> 01:01:40,488
If you give me a kiss
and wish me luck.

1076
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:45,785
Good luck.
Way to go, Mr. W.

1077
01:01:46,495 --> 01:01:47,787
Yeah.

1078
01:01:48,163 --> 01:01:50,331
Okay. I'll see you
in a couple days. Okay?

1079
01:01:50,415 --> 01:01:52,958
Yeah.
Okay.

1080
01:02:05,972 --> 01:02:08,682
Are you smoking?
What are you doing?
I'm a teacher.

1081
01:02:08,767 --> 01:02:11,227
That's an insult.
Put it out.

1082
01:02:13,355 --> 01:02:14,897
Get back in class.
Come on.

1083
01:02:17,818 --> 01:02:21,278
[Man] So, the 30-year-old
is on course.
He is the four-time...

1084
01:02:21,363 --> 01:02:23,364
[Phone Rings]

1085
01:02:30,455 --> 01:02:32,998
Hello?
[Lindsey] I got it.

1086
01:02:34,209 --> 01:02:36,127
Linds?
Mmm.

1087
01:02:36,211 --> 01:02:38,420
I got it.

1088
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:41,423
The promotion?
My period.

1089
01:02:45,345 --> 01:02:48,222
I can tell you were sleeping,
so I'll call you later.

1090
01:02:48,306 --> 01:02:51,183
No, no, no.
I'm up. I'm up. I'm up.

1091
01:02:51,268 --> 01:02:53,602
No, it's okay.

1092
01:02:53,687 --> 01:02:55,855
I'll see you tomorrow.

1093
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:02,695
Hey, Linds.
Yeah?

1094
01:03:04,197 --> 01:03:06,157
Are you okay?

1095
01:03:07,075 --> 01:03:09,076
Yeah.

1096
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:18,043
Safe flight.
Okay. Bye.

1097
01:03:18,128 --> 01:03:20,129
[Line Clicks]

1098
01:04:27,864 --> 01:04:29,907
I'll get it.
No. I got it.
I got it.

1099
01:04:29,991 --> 01:04:31,742
Thank you.
Want me to take it up?

1100
01:04:31,826 --> 01:04:34,203
No. I'm okay.
I'm just gonna
go upstairs.

1101
01:04:35,455 --> 01:04:37,998
Bye.

1102
01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:40,376
Hey. Linds. Uh...

1103
01:04:44,798 --> 01:04:47,633
Did, uh...
Did you want a baby?

1104
01:04:49,344 --> 01:04:50,719
Eventually.

1105
01:04:52,305 --> 01:04:54,306
Well, eventually you will.

1106
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:58,269
Well, it certainly
got me thinking.
That's for sure.

1107
01:04:59,312 --> 01:05:01,647
What do you mean?
Ben.

1108
01:05:03,149 --> 01:05:05,276
If I'm with a guy
for 11 months,

1109
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:07,361
and I think I might be
having his child,

1110
01:05:07,445 --> 01:05:09,780
I'm gonna ask myself,
"Is this the guy?"

1111
01:05:10,282 --> 01:05:13,325
And if it is,
"What's this
going to be like?"

1112
01:05:13,410 --> 01:05:17,246
You know, if we're to be
Mr. And Mrs. Ben and Lindsey,
How's this going to work?

1113
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:19,415
It's like Robin's
birthday party.

1114
01:05:19,499 --> 01:05:21,041
The minute
I got the invitation,

1115
01:05:21,126 --> 01:05:24,336
I had to run to
the refrigerator and check
the Red Sox schedule.

1116
01:05:24,546 --> 01:05:26,922
And the Yankees are playing,
so I know I'm going stag.

1117
01:05:27,007 --> 01:05:31,302
And that's okay.
I'm fine with that.
But how far does it go?

1118
01:05:31,386 --> 01:05:33,721
You know,
"Grandma, don't die
because

1119
01:05:33,805 --> 01:05:35,764
"the Red Sox are
going out on the road,

1120
01:05:35,849 --> 01:05:38,183
so please wait until
they come back to die."

1121
01:05:38,268 --> 01:05:42,396
And, "Doctor, induce labor
because the Oakland A's
are coming in tomorrow."

1122
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:44,523
Do you remember last winter?

1123
01:05:44,774 --> 01:05:47,318
This is exactly
what you liked about me.

1124
01:05:47,694 --> 01:05:50,779
That I was capable
of having a passionate
commitment with something.

1125
01:05:50,864 --> 01:05:52,489
Uh, a devotion.

1126
01:05:52,574 --> 01:05:56,493
Yes, but you feel it
for the Red Sox, and I was
hoping that someday

1127
01:05:56,578 --> 01:05:58,662
you might redirect that.

1128
01:06:01,666 --> 01:06:04,793
All those things
that you feel
for that team,

1129
01:06:04,878 --> 01:06:08,047
I feel them too,
for you.

1130
01:06:23,772 --> 01:06:26,982
You know what she's saying
to me, Ryan? She's saying
I have an addiction.

1131
01:06:27,067 --> 01:06:29,443
Really? Well, you work
90 hours a week.

1132
01:06:29,527 --> 01:06:33,447
You know, that... But I guess
that addiction's more
socially acceptable, you know.

1133
01:06:33,531 --> 01:06:35,240
Am I wrong?
Am I wrong?

1134
01:06:35,325 --> 01:06:38,660
Well, nobody's really wrong
in these situations.

1135
01:06:38,745 --> 01:06:40,913
I mean, you have
wants and needs.

1136
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:43,415
She likewise.

1137
01:06:43,792 --> 01:06:46,418
Wait for
your pitch, Miosky!

1138
01:06:48,588 --> 01:06:51,382
But she's great.
She's great.
[Ball Strikes Bat]

1139
01:06:51,466 --> 01:06:53,467
Definitely the best girl
I've ever gone out with.

1140
01:06:53,551 --> 01:06:57,137
The... The smartest,
the funniest,
the best-looking.

1141
01:06:57,222 --> 01:06:59,431
The sex is like
the... Well...

1142
01:07:01,434 --> 01:07:04,103
But there's a reason why
she's 30 and not married.

1143
01:07:04,187 --> 01:07:05,854
I mean, you gotta see
the big deal
she's making about

1144
01:07:05,939 --> 01:07:07,523
her friend's
birthday party.

1145
01:07:07,607 --> 01:07:10,192
Oh, God. She's making
a federal case about it.

1146
01:07:10,276 --> 01:07:14,071
I'm, like, hey, what if
I had to work that night?
What if I had a second job?

1147
01:07:14,155 --> 01:07:17,241
You know?
What if I was doing
charity work? Is that cool?

1148
01:07:17,325 --> 01:07:19,368
What if I'm, like,
finishing a painting?

1149
01:07:19,452 --> 01:07:20,869
Is that...
You understand me now?

1150
01:07:21,037 --> 01:07:22,871
See my point?
It's not the time.

1151
01:07:22,956 --> 01:07:25,332
It's she doesn't respect
how I'm spending my time.

1152
01:07:25,417 --> 01:07:27,876
And now she expects me
to miss a Yankees game?

1153
01:07:27,961 --> 01:07:29,878
[Laughs]
Whatever.

1154
01:07:29,963 --> 01:07:32,339

Let's go, Murph.
You're up.

1155
01:07:33,633 --> 01:07:36,218
All right,
Mr. Wrightman.
I gotta bat.

1156
01:07:36,302 --> 01:07:38,804
Let me just leave you
with this thought.

1157
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:39,972
You love the Sox.

1158
01:07:41,141 --> 01:07:43,350
But have they ever
loved you back?

1159
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:52,734
Who are you, Dr. Phil?
Get out of here. Go hit...
Go swing the bat.

[Man Announcing]
The Red Sox
started off tonight

1161
01:07:58,074 --> 01:08:00,492
three games behind
the Yankees.

1162
01:08:00,577 --> 01:08:05,539
Pedro delivers. The ball is
lined over Bellhorn's head
into right center field.

1163
01:08:05,623 --> 01:08:10,002
That'll get another run across
as the Yankees extend
their lead.

Benny boy,
I still can't believe
you're not at the Yankee game.

1167
01:08:24,267 --> 01:08:27,060
Yeah, well, if the Yankees
looked that good in a dress,

1168
01:08:27,312 --> 01:08:29,688
I'd be at the game.

[Glass Clinking]

1170
01:08:44,954 --> 01:08:48,040
There's no way to measure
what she is worth.

1171
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:50,918
I'm the luckiest man
on the face of the Earth.

Okay. "I'm the luckiest man

once in a while."

Really embarrassing.
Really bad.

I love you,

turned

were learned

if I could dance with you

Would there suddenly be
sunshine on a cold and

getting $200 on the street.

a dozen women celebrating
topless in the streets.

No. You don't understand.

in the bottom
of the ninth to win 8-7.

This is like a nightmare.

from God or something.

this was the best night

it was.

not to go.

Of course not. No.

after 11 years of never
missing an inning, to suddenly
not go to a Yankees game.

just a game!

If it was,
then obviously I wouldn't
care about it this much.

How about five?

that you've cared about
for 23 years.

Yeah. No, um,
there isn't actually anything
I've wanted for 23 years

1272
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:23,959
because 23 years ago
I was seven,

1273
01:14:24,043 --> 01:14:28,713
and if I still wanted to marry
Scott Baio, I would think that
my life went terribly wrong.

01:14:31,008 --> 01:14:34,010

was so different.

Well, the Red Sox's
once-promising season

1282
01:15:08,838 --> 01:15:11,590
has certainly taken
a turn for the worse.

01:15:34,530 --> 01:15:36,615
Oh, you...

1290
01:15:36,699 --> 01:15:38,992
[Crowd Booing]
Well, that's it.

1291
01:15:39,076 --> 01:15:41,077
The Yankees officially
clinch the division.

1292
01:15:41,162 --> 01:15:44,706
Seven years in a row now,
we finish with our faces
in their butts.

1293
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:48,418
Hey, hey, hey.
It's not time to jump off
the Tobin Bridge yet, okay?

1294
01:15:48,502 --> 01:15:50,045
We still have the wild card.

1295
01:15:50,129 --> 01:15:53,632
Oh, that's easy.
First we gotta beat Oakland
or Anaheim, on the road.

1296
01:15:53,716 --> 01:15:56,176
Then we gotta play
the Yankees
in the house of pain.

1297
01:15:56,469 --> 01:15:59,012
Why do we inflict this
on ourselves?

1298
01:15:59,096 --> 01:16:00,805
Why?

1299
01:16:00,890 --> 01:16:02,807
I'll tell you why.

1300
01:16:02,975 --> 01:16:05,352
'Cause the Red Sox
never let you down.

1301
01:16:05,937 --> 01:16:08,772
Huh?
That's right. I mean...

1302
01:16:08,856 --> 01:16:11,608
Why? 'Cause they haven't
won a world series
in a century or so?

1303
01:16:11,692 --> 01:16:14,110
So what?
They're here.

1304
01:16:14,195 --> 01:16:16,571
Every April, they're here.

1305
01:16:16,656 --> 01:16:20,116
At 1:05 or at 7:05,
there is a game.

1306
01:16:20,201 --> 01:16:23,620
And if it gets rained out,
guess what.
They make it up to you.

1307
01:16:23,955 --> 01:16:25,914
Does anyone else
in your life do that?

1308
01:16:25,998 --> 01:16:27,874
The Red Sox
don't get divorced.

1309
01:16:28,167 --> 01:16:31,378
This is a real family.
This is the family
that's here for you.

1310
01:16:31,462 --> 01:16:34,214
You know, I don't ask her
to give up her family, do I?

1311
01:16:34,298 --> 01:16:38,385
Come on!
Let's get some runs!
Let's get some runs!

1312
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:42,180
You know the best part?
I can get over her
because I am a Red Sox fan.

1313
01:16:42,974 --> 01:16:46,059
I mean, I'm tough.
I've been through a lot
in this park, man.

1314
01:16:46,143 --> 01:16:48,019
I can take this.

1315
01:16:48,104 --> 01:16:50,188
Because I am bulletproof.

1328
01:17:20,011 --> 01:17:22,554
Oh, my God.
The Buckner game?

1329
01:17:22,638 --> 01:17:24,472
I thought you took
that away from him!
I did!

1330

And the Mets win it!

1334

It wasn't just Buckner.
Stanley screwed him.

1335
01:17:42,742 --> 01:17:44,075
He didn't cover first.

1336
01:17:44,410 --> 01:17:47,370
Where'd you get this?
I... I don't remember.

1337
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:50,040
Don't lie to me.
Right. Do you have
any more of these?

1338
01:17:50,124 --> 01:17:52,083
Huh? Where's your stash?

1339
01:17:52,418 --> 01:17:54,252
Ben, this isn't
helping you.

1340
01:17:55,004 --> 01:17:57,881
You understand that?
This solves nothing!

1341
01:17:58,591 --> 01:18:00,383
Ben, look at you.

1342
01:18:00,468 --> 01:18:01,926
Yeah, leave me alone.

1343
01:18:04,221 --> 01:18:07,265
All right.
Let's clean him up.
[Gerard] Come on.

1344
01:18:07,349 --> 01:18:10,060
I let her down.
Let's go.

1345
01:18:10,144 --> 01:18:12,270
I am the Red Sox.
You're not
the Red Sox.

1346
01:18:12,354 --> 01:18:14,481
I am the Red Sox.
You're not the Red Sox.

1347
01:18:15,608 --> 01:18:17,275
Get him up on the shoulder
there, Gerard.

1348
01:18:17,359 --> 01:18:19,486
I got the
shoulder right now.

1349
01:18:19,570 --> 01:18:22,906
What are you doing?
Relax. I'm a doctor.

1350
01:18:22,990 --> 01:18:26,993
Yeah, well, not to pry,
Doc, but why are you
shaving my balls?

1351
01:18:28,871 --> 01:18:32,040
Well, if you don't
want me to...
No, I don't want you to.

1352
01:18:32,124 --> 01:18:34,125

Swing and a fly ball
to left field! Way back!

1355
01:18:44,804 --> 01:18:47,347
Way back!
The Red Sox are going

1356
01:18:47,431 --> 01:18:50,141
to the American League
Championship Series

1357
01:18:50,226 --> 01:18:52,936
on the back of David Ortiz!

1358
01:18:53,020 --> 01:18:54,604
All right. You've been
waiting all year for this.

1359
01:18:54,688 --> 01:18:57,941
The Yankees, Red Sox,
the best rivalry in sports
starts tonight.

1360
01:18:58,025 --> 01:19:00,443
8:00, Yankee stadium.
Let's get it on.

1361
01:19:00,736 --> 01:19:03,613
[Man Announcing]
The 2-2 pitch.
Mueller back to Rivera.

1362
01:19:03,697 --> 01:19:06,908
To second for one.
On to first. Double play!

1363
01:19:06,992 --> 01:19:09,077
And the Yankees take game one.

1364
01:19:09,912 --> 01:19:13,248
[Man Announcing]
The Yankees are a strike away.
Here's a 1-2 pitch.

1365
01:19:13,332 --> 01:19:16,417
Struck him out swinging
that'll wrap it up.

1366
01:19:16,502 --> 01:19:20,421
For the second night in a row,
the Yankees have beaten
the Red Sox.

1367
01:19:21,507 --> 01:19:24,425
Here's a 2-0.
Mueller flies to center.

1368
01:19:24,510 --> 01:19:27,929
Bernie Williams is there,
and the Yankees have won it.

1369
01:19:28,013 --> 01:19:31,141
The end of a long night,
and perhaps the end for
the Boston Red Sox,

1370
01:19:31,225 --> 01:19:35,061
losing tonight 19-8,
now falling in the series
three games to none.

1371
01:19:35,146 --> 01:19:37,647
I mean, this thing is over.
They keep swinging the bats

1372
01:19:37,731 --> 01:19:39,691
the way they are, Don,
this thing's done.

1373
01:19:44,196 --> 01:19:46,531
19-8. Good God.

1374
01:19:46,824 --> 01:19:49,367
Will you stop
saying that? Okay?

1375
01:19:50,202 --> 01:19:53,079
Now, who we pitching
tomorrow?
What's the difference?

1376
01:19:53,164 --> 01:19:55,623
We're losing
three games to nothing
to the Yankees.

1377
01:19:55,708 --> 01:19:58,543
In a hundred years,
no team in the play-offs
has ever come back from that.

1378
01:19:58,878 --> 01:20:02,422
It's over. It's finished.
Bye. Wave to it.
Bye, Charlie. Bye, Charlie.

1379
01:20:02,506 --> 01:20:06,176
Oh. Isn't that
Jason Varitek?

1380
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:09,554
[Kevin]
Yeah. That is him.

1381
01:20:09,638 --> 01:20:11,556
With Johnny Damon and Trot.

1382
01:20:11,682 --> 01:20:14,142
[Troy]
They're eating.
So what?

1383
01:20:14,226 --> 01:20:17,437
So what? We're sitting here
dining on our guts
over the Red Sox.

1384
01:20:17,521 --> 01:20:20,356
And there three members
of the Red Sox are eating.

1385
01:20:20,441 --> 01:20:22,483
With gusto?

1386
01:20:22,568 --> 01:20:24,777
Ironic.
Ironic?

1387
01:20:24,862 --> 01:20:27,864
Ted Williams would roll over
in his freezer if he saw this.

1388
01:20:28,324 --> 01:20:29,949
[Gerard]
Would you please be cool?

1389
01:20:30,492 --> 01:20:32,243
Why shouldn't they eat?

1390
01:20:32,328 --> 01:20:35,288
They... They played hard.
They did their best. Move on.

1391
01:20:38,292 --> 01:20:40,251
I kind of envy these guys.

1392
01:20:40,669 --> 01:20:43,254
You know. No.
They understand something
that we don't.

1393
01:20:44,715 --> 01:20:46,216
Their whole life
isn't out in that field.

1394
01:20:46,300 --> 01:20:48,468
It's their job.
It's not an obsession.

1395
01:20:50,137 --> 01:20:52,138
My God!

1396
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:54,098
It's official.
I'm an idiot.

Uh, what are you...
What are you, having a party?

1412
01:21:47,194 --> 01:21:50,154
Uh, a group of us, um,
just had this work thing,

1413
01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:52,824
and then some of us
came back here after.

1414
01:21:53,909 --> 01:21:55,994
Um, I'm gonna
talk to him, okay?

1415
01:21:56,078 --> 01:21:58,746
Are you okay?
Yeah. I'm good. Thanks.

1416
01:22:01,959 --> 01:22:04,502
Are you...
Are you on a date?
No. It's...

1417
01:22:05,838 --> 01:22:07,255
It's a work thing.

1418
01:22:07,339 --> 01:22:10,800
I didn't want to go alone,
so, you know... Carrie
and Ezra are here as well.

1419
01:22:10,884 --> 01:22:12,677
Oh. So it's a double date.

1420
01:22:12,761 --> 01:22:15,346
Well, that's...
That's perfect.
That's great.

1421

Ben, what are you
doing here?

1422
01:22:17,308 --> 01:22:19,350
I... I wanted to
talk to you. I...

1423
01:22:20,936 --> 01:22:23,062
I can't believe
you're on a date.
This is like...

1424
01:22:23,188 --> 01:22:26,399
I'm not.
Yeah, well, you know what?
Look. I'll call ya.

1425
01:22:26,483 --> 01:22:28,526
Sorry I bothered you.
I'll call ya.

1426
01:22:29,778 --> 01:22:31,571
No, no.
This is crazy.
I'm sorry.

1427
01:22:31,655 --> 01:22:34,907
I came here for a reason.
All right. Look.
I love you, Lindsey.

1428
01:22:35,242 --> 01:22:38,494
And I think that we should
give this another chance.

1429
01:22:40,331 --> 01:22:43,249
Did you hear me?
Ben...

1430
01:22:43,792 --> 01:22:45,585
Oh... Look, look, look.

1431
01:22:45,669 --> 01:22:48,087
You finish your evening.
All right?
I'll hang out here,

1432
01:22:48,172 --> 01:22:50,048
and when you're done
with your date,
we'll get married.

1433
01:22:54,261 --> 01:22:55,803
I don't think so.

1434
01:22:57,222 --> 01:22:59,265
Hey. What are you saying?
I mean...

1435
01:22:59,350 --> 01:23:00,808
You know, you said
you wanted more.

1436
01:23:00,893 --> 01:23:04,228
I mean, this is
as more as there is.
There is no more.

1437
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:07,106
Yes. But this isn't you.
This is the other guy.

1438
01:23:07,399 --> 01:23:09,233
What other guy?
It's October.

1439
01:23:09,568 --> 01:23:13,029
They're one game from
elimination. You're becoming
Winter Guy again.

1440
01:23:13,113 --> 01:23:15,073
I already know
I like Winter Guy.

1441
01:23:15,157 --> 01:23:17,367
It's Summer Guy
that broke my heart.

1442
01:23:17,743 --> 01:23:19,410
Summer Guy is gone.

1443
01:23:20,245 --> 01:23:22,205
Yes, until summer.

1444
01:23:22,289 --> 01:23:25,083
No, no, no. Look.
Lindsey, I realize, like...
Ben,

1445
01:23:26,710 --> 01:23:29,045
just too much
has happened.

1446
01:23:31,256 --> 01:23:32,673
Oh.

1447
01:23:32,758 --> 01:23:34,592
All right.
Look, look. Uh...

1448
01:23:34,676 --> 01:23:37,387
When the whole
baby thing happened,
I admit I froze.

1449
01:23:37,471 --> 01:23:40,515
All right. I thought of
a million different reasons
why I shouldn't be a father.

1450
01:23:40,599 --> 01:23:43,601
But then I thought of
a reason why I should.

1451
01:23:43,685 --> 01:23:45,686
Because it would be ours.

1452
01:23:45,771 --> 01:23:48,731
You know, it's pieces of us.
And I got so excited.

1453
01:23:48,816 --> 01:23:51,192
I mean, like, I went,
and I got a whole bunch
of Red Sox toys...

1454
01:23:51,276 --> 01:23:53,528
And a little
size-one Red Sox jersey,

1455
01:23:53,612 --> 01:23:56,197
like, for a player
to be named later.

1456
01:23:56,698 --> 01:23:59,117
I still have it
for... Whenever.

1457
01:24:02,371 --> 01:24:04,914
Ben, I just got so hurt.

1458
01:24:04,998 --> 01:24:06,999
Really hurt.

1459
01:24:08,460 --> 01:24:10,461
And sometimes,

1460
01:24:10,546 --> 01:24:12,547
when that happens...

1461
01:24:14,216 --> 01:24:17,677
[Sighs]
Something inside
just shuts off.

1462
01:24:21,849 --> 01:24:23,808
I'm sorry.

1463
01:24:31,650 --> 01:24:33,651
[Sobs]

1464
01:24:40,951 --> 01:24:44,412
I never felt magic
crazy as this

1465
01:24:46,582 --> 01:24:50,168
I never saw moons
knew the meaning of the sea

1466
01:24:51,545 --> 01:24:55,256
I never held emotion
in the palm of my hand

1467
01:24:56,842 --> 01:25:00,511
Or felt sweet breezes
in the top of a tree

1468
01:25:00,888 --> 01:25:02,513
But now you're here

1469
01:25:04,725 --> 01:25:08,019
Brighten my northern sky

1470
01:25:09,521 --> 01:25:11,689
Oh. None for me.
[Robin]
Oh, come on.

1471
01:25:11,815 --> 01:25:13,483
Since when did
you stop drinking?
Yeah.

1472
01:25:13,567 --> 01:25:16,027
Since I... Got pregnant.

1473
01:25:16,111 --> 01:25:18,029
[All Gasp]

1474
01:25:18,113 --> 01:25:20,907
Molly.
I knew it!

1475
01:25:20,991 --> 01:25:22,992
You did not.
Mm-hmm.

1476
01:25:23,076 --> 01:25:25,995
I told Lindsey. I said,
"Her boobs look engorged."
Was Steve excited?

1477
01:25:26,079 --> 01:25:28,831
Are you kidding? He ran out
and bought him... Her...

1478
01:25:28,916 --> 01:25:31,000
A little train engineer hat.
[Cell Phone Rings]

1479
01:25:31,126 --> 01:25:33,794
Oh, I'm sorry.
They do that, don't they?
Little hats...

1480
01:25:33,879 --> 01:25:36,422
Hello. It's Chris!
You gotta come with me.

1481
01:25:36,548 --> 01:25:39,675
Molly's pregnant.
Mr. Myerson just announced
you got the promotion.

1482
01:25:39,801 --> 01:25:43,346
Oh, God! Sorry.
Oh, my God.
Now my breasts are engorged.

1483
01:25:43,472 --> 01:25:45,973
That was Lindsey.
She got her promotion.
[Carrie] He's waiting.

1484
01:25:46,058 --> 01:25:47,141
He's holding champagne.

1485
01:25:47,226 --> 01:25:49,310
Everybody's got a glass.
I told him you're in
the ladies' room.

1486
01:25:49,394 --> 01:25:51,312
Oh. Thank you. Okay.
[Laughs]

1487
01:25:51,396 --> 01:25:54,440
Well... Wait.
I gotta... I'm so sorry.
I gotta go.

1488
01:25:54,525 --> 01:25:56,025
Go, go.

1489
01:25:56,109 --> 01:25:57,777
I gotta go.
Guess what Chris is
doing right now.

1490
01:25:57,861 --> 01:26:00,446
He's buying Ben's
baseball tickets.

1491
01:26:00,948 --> 01:26:02,823
What?

1492
01:26:02,908 --> 01:26:05,284
Ben is selling Chris
his Red Sox tickets.

1493
01:26:05,410 --> 01:26:08,829
Lindsey, please. Let's go!
Wait. You mean, like,
um, for today.

1494
01:26:09,540 --> 01:26:13,459
No. I mean, like, forever.
For 125,000,
it better be forever.

1495
01:26:13,752 --> 01:26:16,170
Are you guys that rich?

1496
01:26:16,713 --> 01:26:18,172
Yeah.

1497
01:26:18,257 --> 01:26:20,258
Why don't you
dress better?

1498
01:26:20,592 --> 01:26:22,176
Wait. Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

1499
01:26:22,261 --> 01:26:25,888
Ben... My Ben... is selling
his Red Sox seats?

1500
01:26:25,973 --> 01:26:28,808
To hell with the seats.
They're holding champagne.

1501
01:26:29,101 --> 01:26:30,810
Come on.

1502
01:26:31,353 --> 01:26:34,313
[Crowd]
Let's go, Red Sox!
[Clapping]

1503
01:26:34,398 --> 01:26:36,482
Let's go, Red Sox!

1504
01:26:38,443 --> 01:26:40,695
You know,
what you're doing is illegal.

1505
01:26:40,779 --> 01:26:43,030
That's right. Technically,
if you give up your tickets,

1506
01:26:43,115 --> 01:26:45,157
you're supposed to give 'em
to the Red Sox.

1507
01:26:45,242 --> 01:26:48,286
Hey. We're friends. Okay?
They'll still be in his name.

1508
01:26:48,370 --> 01:26:51,122
They'll mail them to him,
then he'll give them to me.

1509
01:26:51,206 --> 01:26:53,165
Does the guy with
the big squash always sit
in front of you?

1510
01:26:53,250 --> 01:26:54,375
He's new.

1511
01:26:54,459 --> 01:26:56,544
I don't know.
You want the tickets or not?

1512
01:26:56,628 --> 01:26:59,005
Come on. Ow!
Shame on you.

1513
01:26:59,089 --> 01:27:01,716
Your Uncle Carl
saw 3,000 games
from these seats.

1514
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:04,969
He's gonna come back
and haunt you for this.

1515
01:27:05,053 --> 01:27:08,264
[Applause]
[Man] Speech!

1516
01:27:10,183 --> 01:27:11,726
Let's go. Come on.

1517
01:27:11,810 --> 01:27:14,812
Well, first,
thank you, Mr. Myerson.

1518
01:27:14,896 --> 01:27:16,314
Um...
[Clears Throat]

1519
01:27:16,398 --> 01:27:19,275
The truth is
I... I like it here.

1520
01:27:19,359 --> 01:27:20,776
I like this work.

1521
01:27:21,653 --> 01:27:23,613
I know what I'm doing
when I'm here.

1522
01:27:24,656 --> 01:27:27,074
In fact,
it's the only place...

1523
01:27:27,159 --> 01:27:29,368
Where I know what I'm doing.

1524
01:27:30,162 --> 01:27:32,163
This is, uh, controllable.

1525
01:27:33,415 --> 01:27:35,416
It's safe.

1526
01:27:37,377 --> 01:27:39,170
Oh, my God.

1527
01:27:39,254 --> 01:27:42,465
He's selling
his Red Sox tickets for me.

1528
01:27:42,549 --> 01:27:45,593
What have I ever
given up for anybody
that meant that much?

1529
01:27:45,677 --> 01:27:48,679
I'm sorry.
I know this seems crazy,
but I gotta go.

1530
01:27:49,681 --> 01:27:51,182
You realize
you're selling your seats

1531
01:27:51,266 --> 01:27:53,517
for exactly the same price
they sold Babe Ruth for.

1532
01:27:53,602 --> 01:27:57,355
You said it yourself.
Relationships come and go,
but the Red Sox are forever.

1533
01:27:57,981 --> 01:27:59,899
I want my sponges back.

1534
01:28:00,025 --> 01:28:03,027
Would you be selling these
tickets if we were winning?
I bet you wouldn't.

1535
01:28:03,654 --> 01:28:05,404
We're never winning.
That's the point.

1536
01:28:05,489 --> 01:28:07,365
We're down three games
to nothing. It's 4-3.

1537
01:28:07,449 --> 01:28:09,450
They got Rivera warming up
in the bull pen. Look.

1538
01:28:09,534 --> 01:28:11,494
[Man On P.A.]
Designated hitter. Number 18.

1539
01:28:11,578 --> 01:28:13,412
John Olerud.

1540
01:28:13,497 --> 01:28:16,457
Look. If I keep
these seats,

1541
01:28:16,625 --> 01:28:18,876
all I'll think about
every time I'm here is...

1542
01:28:20,087 --> 01:28:22,213
Is what I gave up for them.

1543
01:28:22,297 --> 01:28:24,131
[Tires Squeal]

1544
01:28:24,216 --> 01:28:26,217
[Tires Screech]

1545
01:28:29,721 --> 01:28:31,972
Excuse me.
Is there a ticket window
somewhere?

1546
01:28:32,099 --> 01:28:34,767
Sold out, sweetie.
It's the play-offs.
All right.

1547
01:28:34,893 --> 01:28:37,395
Hey. Hey.
You need tickets?
Oh. You too.

1548
01:28:37,479 --> 01:28:38,938
No, no.
I got tickets.

1549
01:28:39,606 --> 01:28:41,941
We... Then why the sign?
That's for the cops.

1550
01:28:42,025 --> 01:28:44,443
Everybody knows when you say
you need tickets,
means you have tickets.

1551
01:28:44,569 --> 01:28:47,905
Okay. I need a ticket.
Calm down.
I got two. 300 apiece.

1552
01:28:48,240 --> 01:28:49,990
What?
Hey. The only reason
they're that cheap

1553
01:28:50,075 --> 01:28:52,034
is because
it's the eighth inning.
Fine.

1554
01:28:52,119 --> 01:28:54,870
I'll take one.
I can't split 'em up.

1555
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:02,336
Thank you.
Hey, hey.
You know what?

1556
01:29:02,421 --> 01:29:06,298
Since you only need the one
ticket, I'll buy the other one
back for, like, 50 bucks.

1557
01:29:06,383 --> 01:29:08,926
Oh, okay.
That sounds good. Oops.

1558
01:29:09,010 --> 01:29:10,678
Enjoy the game.

1559
01:29:11,722 --> 01:29:15,725
[Cheering]
Ben, how do you know
she'll even take you back?

1560
01:29:16,101 --> 01:29:18,853
It's... It's not just
for her, okay?
It's also for me, okay?

1561
01:29:18,937 --> 01:29:21,939
I gotta get
my life in order.
Some perspective.

1562
01:29:22,023 --> 01:29:23,941
Some balance.
Hey. We've got a deal.

1563
01:29:24,776 --> 01:29:26,318
I'll buy your seats.

1564
01:29:27,863 --> 01:29:29,447
It's a real ticket.

1565
01:29:29,531 --> 01:29:31,699
Oh, it's a real ticket,
but you're at
the wrong entrance.

1566
01:29:31,783 --> 01:29:33,033
You're way over
in center field.

1567
01:29:33,118 --> 01:29:34,660
I just gotta get in
for a minute...

1568
01:29:34,745 --> 01:29:37,705
That's a ploy.
I know it's a ploy.
You're in center field.

1569
01:29:37,914 --> 01:29:39,123
Fine.

1570
01:29:40,584 --> 01:29:42,209
[Man Announcing]
Ground ball
to the right side.

1571
01:29:42,294 --> 01:29:44,462
A race to the bag.
Rivera is there.

1572
01:29:44,546 --> 01:29:48,716
And the Yankees are three
defensive outs away
from the World Series.

1573
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:49,884
Into the ninth.

1574
01:29:54,097 --> 01:29:56,056
Excuse me.

1575
01:29:56,141 --> 01:29:58,309
Excuse me. Ooh. Sorry.

1576
01:29:58,518 --> 01:30:00,519
Excuse me.
[Woman]
Watch it.

1577
01:30:00,604 --> 01:30:02,813
Excuse me. Sorry.

1578
01:30:07,486 --> 01:30:09,820
Can I borrow these
for a second? Thank you.
Yeah.

1579
01:30:09,905 --> 01:30:11,906
Sure.

1580
01:30:21,291 --> 01:30:23,292
No.

1581
01:30:23,460 --> 01:30:25,503
Why don't you have
a cell phone, you idiot?

1582
01:30:26,505 --> 01:30:29,256
Sign by the red tab.
Initial by the yellow tabs.

1583
01:30:29,674 --> 01:30:32,218
What are you buying,
the stadium?
Look at that thing.

1584
01:30:32,302 --> 01:30:35,513
Floyd the Barber,
we're not in Mayberry, okay?
Thank you.

1585
01:30:37,682 --> 01:30:39,934
Hey. Down in front.
Come on, sweetie.

1586
01:30:40,018 --> 01:30:42,019
Hold your horses, buddy.

1587
01:30:42,103 --> 01:30:44,271
[Panting]

1588
01:30:44,356 --> 01:30:46,398
Robin. Wait. No.
I can't talk right now.

1589
01:30:46,483 --> 01:30:48,526
Listen. I just need
Chris's cell phone number.

1590
01:30:55,283 --> 01:30:57,910
[Scoffs]

1591
01:31:01,456 --> 01:31:03,958
[Cell Phone Rings]
That's odd.

1592
01:31:04,042 --> 01:31:06,001
You're having a stroke.
Good.

1593
01:31:06,837 --> 01:31:08,212
I don't want to talk now.
I'm at the ball game.

1594
01:31:08,296 --> 01:31:09,839
Chris!
[Beeps Off]

1595
01:31:09,965 --> 01:31:11,048
Damn it!

1596
01:31:12,968 --> 01:31:14,176
[Sheri]
Ben, come on.

1597
01:31:14,261 --> 01:31:15,678
Don't do it.
This is crazy.

1598
01:31:15,762 --> 01:31:17,680
Think about it, Ben.

1599
01:31:17,764 --> 01:31:19,682
Check's all made out.

1600
01:31:19,766 --> 01:31:22,393
I'll invite you to
some of the games.

1601
01:31:30,277 --> 01:31:32,278
I'm sorry, Uncle Carl.

1602
01:31:33,697 --> 01:31:36,991
[Pen Scribbling]
Another idiot.

1603
01:31:41,788 --> 01:31:44,415
And when you think
it's all over

1604
01:31:44,499 --> 01:31:46,792
[Groans]

1605
01:31:46,877 --> 01:31:51,338
It's not over

1606
01:31:51,423 --> 01:31:54,008
When you think it's all over

1607
01:31:54,092 --> 01:31:55,551
It's not over

1608
01:31:55,635 --> 01:31:57,428
[Crowd Cheering]

1609
01:31:57,512 --> 01:31:59,054
It's not over

1610
