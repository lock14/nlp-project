- Bad driver.
- Not necessarily.

- Most certainly.

- And we both know who with.
- Eve Draper.

- True.

- Favoured older men.
- Fingered.

- Worked at?
- Council.

- Department of Planning and Development.

[SIREN BLARING]

1024
01:04:43,540 --> 01:04:44,910
Hello, Miss Tiller.

1025
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:47,710
I was wondering,
do you have any Japanese Peace Lilies?

1026
01:04:47,830 --> 01:04:49,250
Of course.

1027
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,420
I was just about to pop off, actually.

1028
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:55,590
I can never find my scissors.

1029
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:59,760
- Is this for someone special?
- Yes. Yes, it is.

1030
01:05:02,220 --> 01:05:06,850
- Are you going somewhere, Miss Tiller?
- Yes. I'm moving away.

1031
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:11,110
And why the move,
if you don't mind me asking?

1032
01:05:11,230 --> 01:05:16,030
- Well, just between you and I...
- Yes?

1033
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:19,200
- You know that fella who blew up?
- George Merchant.

1034
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:22,450
Well, George Merchant, God rest him,
wanted to buy this land,

1035
01:05:22,530 --> 01:05:26,120
so he sends round his legal fella,
Martin Blower, God rest him,

1036
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:28,290
and I thought I might take them up on it.

1037
01:05:28,410 --> 01:05:32,090
I haven't really got that much family
round here, save for Cousin Sissy.

1038
01:05:32,210 --> 01:05:35,630
So I thought I might take them up
on the offer and move to Buford Abbey.

1039
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:37,720
Would you like a card with this?

1040
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:40,220
No, sorry, you were talking about the offer?

1041
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:43,470
Well, it turns out that Martin Blower,
God rest him,

1042
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:45,720
knew where the new bypass road is going

1043
01:05:45,850 --> 01:05:48,890
because he was knocking off Eve Draper
from the council, God rest her,

1044
01:05:49,020 --> 01:05:52,690
and then that reporter, God rest him,
finds out about the route

1045
01:05:52,810 --> 01:05:54,900
and tells me this land's very valuable.

1046
01:05:55,020 --> 01:05:59,070
Ten times what George Merchant and
Martin Blower, God rest them, offered me.

1047
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:02,160
So, with them having passed on,
I decided to sell it on myself

1048
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:05,080
to some folks from the city
that Martin, George and Eve,

1049
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:07,160
God rest the lot of them,
had been talking to.

1050
01:06:07,290 --> 01:06:10,080
Apparently, they want to build
a big shopping center or something.

1051
01:06:10,210 --> 01:06:13,000
Of course, Cousin Sissy won't be
too happy about that,

1052
01:06:13,026 --> 01:06:15,245
but as far as I'm concerned,
Cousin Sissy can go and fuck...

1053
01:06:15,250 --> 01:06:17,840
Would you just excuse me,
for just one second?

1054
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:34,270
Stop!

- And Eve Draper?
- Yes!

- And Martin Blower?
- No, actually.

Thank you, Andy.

Come on, Sergeant, you've gotta accept
it was just another nasty accident.

1068
01:08:02,900 --> 01:08:03,950
What are you suggesting?

1069
01:08:04,070 --> 01:08:06,530
That Leslie Tiller tripped
and fell on her own shears?

1070
01:08:06,660 --> 01:08:09,120
Ben Fletcher fell
on his pitchfork the other week.

- Because I was there!
- There's a point.

01:08:17,250 --> 01:08:21,460

a Japanese Peace Lily for his birthday.

01:08:21,590 --> 01:08:24,130
What absolute horseshit.

01:08:24,260 --> 01:08:28,180
I chased a suspect from the scene.
Innocent people don't run!

1077
01:08:28,300 --> 01:08:31,390
Here, maybe it was our old friend,
the cactus thief.

01:08:31,470 --> 01:08:34,140
Oh, yeah, he was a prickly customer,
weren't he?

1079
01:08:35,020 --> 01:08:37,730
Am I going completely mad?

1080
01:08:39,860 --> 01:08:41,480
Maybe you are.

1081
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:46,150
Maybe you did it.

1082
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:49,570

- No, you have to understand.

1088
01:09:07,470 --> 01:09:11,390
The boys here aren't used
to the concepts you're bandying about.

1089
01:09:12,060 --> 01:09:14,520
The "M" word, Nicholas.

1090
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:18,810
There hasn't been a recorded murder

But, sir, I'm certain.

1102

01:10:07,740 --> 01:10:11,740
- Why on earth would I do that, Sergeant?
- I'm glad you asked.

1104
01:10:13,490 --> 01:10:15,660
My suspicions were first aroused
when you appeared

01:10:15,740 --> 01:10:18,500
<i>at the scene of the Blower-Draper death,

in the center of the village.</i>

1107
01:10:23,670 --> 01:10:28,010
I couldn't help but recall your comments
at the theater on the previous evening.

1108
01:10:28,260 --> 01:10:31,180
<i>When you not only indicated
an awareness of the couple's affair</i>

1109
01:10:31,300 --> 01:10:33,260
<i>but also inferred
that Eve's connections at the council</i>

1110
01:10:33,390 --> 01:10:36,350
<i>might make her privy
to important information.</i>

1111

the route of the proposed Sandford Bypass.

<i>after an article Tim Messenger
wrote in the Sandford Citizen.</i>

1116
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:53,950
You see, the land Merchant was buying
had little value in of itself but,

Consumed with concern for your business

and potential disloyalty
from fickle customers,

1121
01:11:04,290 --> 01:11:06,840

<i>The true value of her land.</i>

Upon discovering she was about
to sell up to the developers,

You clearly aren't aware that we're related.

Oh, but I am, "Cousin Sissy."

1140
01:12:06,270 --> 01:12:10,610
I'm afraid my nickname of Sissy
is only a revelation to yourself.

1141
01:12:10,900 --> 01:12:14,280
My teenage years studying ballet
are well known.

01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:17,530
- Yeah, Sissy Skinner.
- What a Gaylord.

Thank you, Andrews.

Now, despite my comments
about "beheading" customers,

1145
01:12:22,700 --> 01:12:26,210
I personally relish the competition
of another store.

1146
01:12:26,330 --> 01:12:29,960
Anything to energize my workforce.

1147
01:12:31,460 --> 01:12:36,050
And anyway, what makes you think
I could dislodge part of the church roof?

1148
01:12:36,180 --> 01:12:38,640
Or for that matter, stage a car crash?

1149
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:42,100
It's a well known fact that
the church roof is in dire need of repair.

1150
01:12:42,180 --> 01:12:44,310
And isn't it true
that two of your own employees

1151
01:12:44,430 --> 01:12:46,900
operate the vehicle removal service
for the council?

1152
01:12:46,980 --> 01:12:49,360
Sergeant, this is the 21st Century.

1153
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:52,320
Many people hold down several jobs.

I myself host a life drawing class
at the Village Hall.

Tina here is a table dancer at Flappers.

1156
01:12:59,620 --> 01:13:03,450
Nevertheless, you could have utilized
the vehicle removal truck for your own ends.

1157
01:13:03,580 --> 01:13:05,580
These accusations
are quite meaningless, Sergeant,

1158
01:13:05,710 --> 01:13:08,330
unless you can back them up
with hard evidence.

1159
01:13:08,420 --> 01:13:10,960
Well, you've got me there.

1160
01:13:11,090 --> 01:13:13,090
I'd need something conclusive.

1161
01:13:13,170 --> 01:13:15,340
Something that placed you
at the scene of the crime.

1162
01:13:15,420 --> 01:13:19,430
Perhaps a wound you sustained on
a piece of broken glass this very evening.
