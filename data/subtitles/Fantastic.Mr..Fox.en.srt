1
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:00,035
What'd the doctor say?

2
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:04,248
Nothing. Supposedly it's just
a 24-hour bug. He gave me some pills.

3
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:06,667
l told you
you probably just ate some bad gristle.

4
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:08,377
Should we take the short cut
or the scenic route?

5
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:09,795
Let's take the short cut.

6
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,505
But the scenic route is so much prettier.

7
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:13,924
-Okay, let's take the scenic route.
-Great.

8
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:16,009
lt's actually slightly quicker anyway.

9
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:27,229
Thank you.

10
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:37,739
What is a squab?

11
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:40,659
You know what it is.
lt's like a pigeon l suppose.

12
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:42,327
Should we go through the hole
under the horse fence,

13
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:44,037
or climb the rail over the bridle path?

14
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:46,290
The horse fence is a little safer.

15
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:49,543
But the bridle path puts us
right next to the squab shack.

16
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:51,795
Well, okay.

17
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:54,756
What's wrong? You're acting skittish.

18
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:58,760
Don't worry. l've been stealing birds
for a living since before l could trot.

19
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:03,056
You look unbelievably beautiful tonight.
You're practically glowing.

20
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:04,766
Maybe it's the lighting.

21
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:07,436
Come on.

22
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,058
What's that?

23
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:48,602
-l think it's a fox trap. Look at this.
-Get away from there.

24
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:49,853
ls it spring-loaded?

25
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:54,483
l guess if you come from over there
and stand at this door to the squab shack,

26
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,234
this little gadget probably triggers...

27
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,236
Move out of the way,
that's where it's going to land.

28
00:03:58,321 --> 00:03:59,821
Don't... Let's go!

29
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,912
No, it just falls straight right down.

30
00:04:08,247 --> 00:04:09,665
lt's not spring-loaded.

31
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:10,749
l'm pregnant.

32
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:16,338
Wow. We're going to have a cub.

33
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:18,799
That's great news.

34
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:20,550
lf we're still alive...

35
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:29,059
lf we're still alive tomorrow morning,
l want you to find another line of work.

36
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,687
Okay.

37
00:04:57,782 --> 00:05:00,951
Does anybody actually read my column?
Do your friends talk about it?

38
00:05:01,035 --> 00:05:04,496
Of course. ln fact,
Rabbit's ex-girlfriend said to me,

39
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:07,207
"l should read Foxy's column."
But they don't get the Gazette.

40
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:08,750
Ash! Let's get cracking.

41
00:05:08,835 --> 00:05:10,460
Why would they? lt's a rag sheet.

42
00:05:10,545 --> 00:05:11,837
-l'm sick.
-You're not.

43
00:05:11,921 --> 00:05:13,755
-l have a temperature.
-You don't.

44
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,299
-l don't want to go.
-Hurry up. You'll be late.

45
00:05:16,384 --> 00:05:18,385
l love the way you handled that.

46
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:25,532
Your cousin Kristofferson's
coming on the 6th.

47
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:29,494
Be extra nice to him,
he's going through a hard time right now.

48
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,955
-Where will he sleep?
-ln your room.

49
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,249
l can't spare the space.
Put him in Dad's study.

50
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:37,002
Dad's study is occupied by Dad.

51
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:43,175
l don't want to live in a hole anymore.
lt makes me feel poor.

52
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:46,011
We are poor. But we're happy.

53
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:49,931
Comme ci, comme ça. Anyway,
the views are better above ground.

54
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,562
Honey, l'm 7 non-fox-years old.
My father died at 7-1/2.

55
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:59,816
l don't want to live in a hole anymore.
l'm going to do something about it.

56
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:11,161
Well, l'm off.
Have a good day, my darlings.

57
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:15,499
You know, foxes live in holes for a reason.

58
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:18,627
Yes and no.

59
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:25,967
What are you wearing? Why a cape
with the pants tucked in your socks?

60
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:32,307
l guess he's just

61
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:34,935
different.

62
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:41,650
l'm not the listing agent on it,
so it doesn't matter to me. l know he's...

63
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:45,737
Actually, there he is. Mr. Fox! Here it is!

64
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:49,616
This is the tree! Come on over.
l'll call you back, Bob.

65
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:54,037
Obviously, it's first growth, indigenous,
original dirt floor.

66
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:57,332
Good bark, skipping stone hearth,
as you can see.

67
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,584
Kylie. Kylie!

68
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:02,170
l'm showing the property.
You're not supposed to be here.

69
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,588
What time is it? Sorry.

70
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:06,758
This is Kylie, the super. He's a little...

71
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,927
What's in the bucket, Mr. Kylie?

72
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:11,930
See what his eyes look like? Hey, Kylie!

73
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:14,933
Huh? Just minnows. Want to try one?

74
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:16,643
Certainly. Thank you.

75
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:23,316
lt's not exactly an evergreen, is it?
Are there any pines on the market?

76
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:26,236
Pines are hard to come by
in your price range.

77
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,612
What's that?

78
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,959
What do you do for a living, Mr. Fox?

79
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:43,962
l used to steal birds,
but now l'm a newspaperman.

80
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:46,423
Oh, sure. l've seen your byline.

81
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:50,468
-Good afternoon, gentlemen.
-You're going?

82
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:55,056
Oh, and Kylie, thank you for the minnow.
lt was superb.

83
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,275
Don't buy this tree, Foxy.

84
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:07,569
You're borrowing at 9.5%
with no fixed rate,

85
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:10,030
plus moving into the most dangerous
neighborhood in the country

86
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:11,740
for your species.

87
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,325
You're exaggerating.

88
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:17,954
l'm sugar-coating it.
This is Boggis, Bunce and Bean,

89
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:21,833
three of the meanest, nastiest,
ugliest farmers in the history of this valley.

90
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,710
Really? Tell me about them.

91
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:26,588
All right.

92
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:30,467
Walt Boggis is a chicken farmer.
Probably the most successful in the world.

93
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:33,178
He weighs the same
as a young rhinoceros.

94
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:37,349
He eats three chickens every day
for breakfast, lunch, supper and dessert.

95
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:39,517
That's twelve in total per diem.

96
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,686
Nate Bunce is a duck and goose farmer.

97
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:44,356
He's approximately the size
of a pot-bellied dwarf,

98
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,732
and his chin would be underwater

99
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:48,318
in the shallow end of any swimming pool
on the planet.

100
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:50,028
His food is homemade doughnuts

101
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:52,822
with smashed-up goose livers
injected into them.

102
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,575
Frank Bean is a turkey and apple farmer.

103
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,869
He invented his own species of each.

104
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:03,124
He lives on a liquid diet of strong alcoholic
cider, which he makes from his apples.

105
00:09:04,543 --> 00:09:06,795
He's skinny as a pencil, smart as a whip,

106
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:09,673
and possibly the scariest man
currently living.

107
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:16,888
The local human children sing
a kind of eerie little rhyme about him.

108
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,848
Here, listen to this.

109
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:22,894
Boggis, Bunce and Bean
One fat, one short, one lean

110
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,021
These horrible crooks
So different in looks

111
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:27,274
Were nonetheless equally mean

112
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:32,028
ln summation, l think
you just got to not do it. That's all.

113
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:35,991
l understand what you're saying,
and your comments are valuable,

114
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:38,618
but l'm going to ignore your advice.

115
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,245
The cuss you are.

116
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:45,000
The cuss am l? Are you cussing with me?

117
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,002
-Are you cussing with me?
-Don't cussing point at me.

118
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:50,547
Don't cuss with someone
you're not going to cuss with.

119
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:01,433
-Just buy the tree.
-Okay.

120
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:05,020
Take a left, then to the right.
Set them down. Help that other guy.

121
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:08,565
Lift with your legs, not your back.
Don't try to be a superman.

122
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:12,652
We got two circuits here,
yellow and green. Keep them separated.

123
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:15,822
We need to bring about 2% more in.

124
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:18,533
A little bit more, a little bit more.
Looks good.

125
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:22,078
Get that bottom structure settled in.
Bring in the side unit.

126
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:25,832
Be careful of the branches, guys.
Don't peel away the bark.

127
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,546
Wow.

128
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,049
Hi.

129
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:58,031
He's slightly younger,
but a cuss of a lot bigger.

130
00:10:58,115 --> 00:11:01,785
That's just genetics, l guess.
Ash has a littler body type.

131
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:09,876
Go.

132
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:11,961
Watch this, Dad!

133
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:15,673
Well, well.

134
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:18,468
Good jump, Ash.
Remember to keep your tail tucked.

135
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:24,265
Still painting thunderstorms, l see.

136
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,267
Do you still feel poor?

137
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,104
Less so.

138
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,828
Look at that! This kid's a natural.
l'm speechless, Kristofferson.

139
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:55,296
Plus, he knows karate.

140
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:03,721
-Do you think l'm an athlete?
-What are you talking about?

141
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,849
Well, l think l'm an athlete.

142
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:09,185
Sometimes l feel like you guys
don't see me that way.

143
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:12,021
What's the subtext here? ls he praying?

144
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:14,149
l think that's yoga.

145
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:19,654
How long is Kristofferson
supposed to stay with us?

146
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:21,322
Until your uncle gets better.

147
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,908
But roughly how long do we plan
to give him on that?

148
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:27,120
Double pneumonia. lt's not that big a deal.

149
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:29,122
Lower your voice, Ash.

150
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:40,008
Who am l, Kylie?

151
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:42,093
Who how? What now?

152
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:46,139
Why a fox? Why not a horse,
a beetle or a bald eagle?

153
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:49,225
l'm saying this more as existentialism.

154
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,895
Who am l,
and how can a fox ever be happy

155
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:55,523
without, forgive the expression,
a chicken in its teeth?

156
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:58,776
l don't know what you're talking about,
but it sounds illegal.

157
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:01,029
Here, put this bandit hat on.

158
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:05,074
Maybe you're a medium. Take it off
and don't wear it around the house.

159
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:08,411
And so it begins.

160
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:13,750
Do you mind if l slide my bedroll
slightly out from under the train set?

161
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:16,336
lt's hard to sleep
in that corkscrew position.

162
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:21,799
There's a lot of attitudes going on
around here. Don't let me get one.

163
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,468
lt's just that my spinal cord is...

164
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:24,802
Sleep wherever you want.

165
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:28,848
Here, take my bed.
l'll crawl under the bookcase.

166
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:31,142
Who cares if l get splinters in my ears?

167
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:32,977
-Never mind.
-Are you going to pout about it?

168
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:36,606
l've had it up to here
with the sad house guest routine.

169
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:45,698
Good night.

170
00:14:42,881 --> 00:14:46,050
l used to do this professionally
and l was very successful at it.

171
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,468
l had to get out of it for personal reasons,

172
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:51,514
but l've decided to secretly do
one last big job on the sly.

173
00:14:51,598 --> 00:14:54,475
l'm bringing you in as my secretary
and personal assistant.

174
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,685
Okay.

175
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:59,355
This is actually kind of a big deal,
so don't just say, "Okay."

176
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,440
Okay, thank you.

177
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:03,985
l'm going to tape this for my records,
so don't make a lot of sounds.

178
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,945
Meaning, stop rocking.

179
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:08,948
Master Plan. Phase one. Side A.

180
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:11,576
We'll start with
Boggis's Chicken House Number One.

181
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,954
His only security is a few old
hunting beagles and a low stone wall.

182
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:18,666
A word about beagles,
never look a beagle directly in the eye.

183
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:21,377
Why not? Beagles aren't so tough.

184
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:26,132
One of these beagles has chronic rabies,
which he's on medication for.

185
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:29,927
lf you get bitten by him, you have to get
shots in your stomach for six months.

186
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:31,262
l'm not going to justify this.

187
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:34,098
Just pay attention and stop interrupting.
l'm taping this.

188
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,142
l picked some blueberries and laced each

189
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:38,436
with 1 0 mg of high potency
sleeping powder.

190
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,812
Enough to tranquilize a gorilla.

191
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:42,940
-How do we make them eat it?
-Beagles love blueberries.

192
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:46,277
Remember, they aren't very smart,
but they're incredibly paranoid,

193
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:48,613
so always kill a chicken in one bite.

194
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,907
One bite, get it?

195
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:54,327
Are you listening to me?
l look in your eyes

196
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:56,204
and can't tell if you get anything l say.

197
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,126
Magnesium.

198
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,004
-Magnesium!
-Sorry.

199
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:07,965
Pipette.

200
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,801
-Pipette!
-Oh, sorry.

201
00:16:10,677 --> 00:16:13,096
Potassium... What are you looking at?

202
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,389
Oh, no.

203
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,601
Why's your cousin such a wet sandwich?

204
00:16:18,685 --> 00:16:20,269
-l beg your pardon?
-What's that mean?

205
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:22,480
That means l didn't understand,
a wet sandwich?

206
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:26,025
A wet sandwich, he's too short,
he dresses like a girl, he's

207
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:27,402
different.

208
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:30,321
Are you a bully?
You're starting to sound like a bully.

209
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,073
Watch this.

210
00:16:33,992 --> 00:16:35,660
You just destroyed the whole experiment.

211
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:38,413
We better extinguish this magnesium.
Stand back.

212
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:46,921
l like your ears.

213
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:48,423
Mine?

214
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:51,217
Thank you. l like your spots.

215
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:54,554
Really? l used to cover them up,
but, you know...

216
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:58,975
-You're supposed to be my lab partner.
-l am.

217
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:01,853
No, you're not. You're disloyal.

218
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:26,002
A few beagles, as we discussed,
but we're ready for that.

219
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:31,090
ln the old days, didn't we do a thing
when somebody saw a wolf...

220
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:32,800
Wolf? What wolf?

221
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,971
Nothing? Never mind.

222
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:40,725
Here comes a little stone wall.
Not a problem.

223
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:47,732
What the cuss? Where did this giant fence
come from? We had a master plan.

224
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:48,858
What's this lightning bolt?

225
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:53,404
lt could mean the fence might be electric.

226
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:56,866
l hope it doesn't mean thunder,
because l have a phobia of that.

227
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:08,419
Watch this.

228
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:35,863
Beagles love blueberries. Didn't l tell you?
The master plan is working again.

229
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,449
This is the tricky part.

230
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,326
One of us has to jump the barbed wire,

231
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,995
slide under the tire spikes
and open the fence latch.

232
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,830
-Who will it be?
-Not me.

233
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:48,459
Kristofferson could do this easily.
He's like an Olympic level...

234
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:51,003
Why don't we run that way?
There's no obstacles.

235
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:53,673
Yeah, that's better.

236
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:05,768
-l said, one bite.
-l'm trying!

237
00:19:05,852 --> 00:19:08,729
l have a different kind of teeth from you.
l'm an opossum.

238
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:10,189
Give me that.

239
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:14,193
That's so grisly. There's blood.

240
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:15,570
Follow me.

241
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:33,879
All right, what's the master escape plan?

242
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:38,301
Follow me again.

243
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:45,600
Quick!

244
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:48,936
Give me that!

245
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,907
Let's hit the five-and-dime
on the way home.

246
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:04,535
We'll make fake price tags
and wrap the chickens in wax paper,

247
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,495
so it looks like we bought them!

248
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:17,715
Where'd you get this chicken?

249
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:20,301
At the five-and-dime last night.

250
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:23,262
lt has a Boggis Farms tag around its ankle.

251
00:20:24,222 --> 00:20:26,641
Must have escaped from there
before l bought it.

252
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:37,401
Bunce tonight. He has a refrigerated
smokehouse with geese...

253
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:41,405
l thought you said
we were only doing one last big job.

254
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,992
We are. But it's not done yet.
lt's a triple-header.

255
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:25,241
Let's see some hustle.

256
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:27,702
l've never played whack-bat.
What are the rules?

257
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,870
No whack-bat on the other side
of the river?

258
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:33,290
No, we mostly just run grass sprints
or play acorns.

259
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,334
lt's real simple.

260
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:39,130
There's 3 grabbers, 3 taggers, 5
twig-runners and the player at whack-bat.

261
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:41,632
The center-tagger lights a pinecone
and chucks it over the basket.

262
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:44,301
The whack-batter tries to hit
the cedar-stick off the cross-rock.

263
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:45,928
The twig-runners dash back and forth

264
00:21:46,012 --> 00:21:48,389
until the pinecone burns out
and the umpire calls, "hot box."

265
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:51,142
At the end, you count
how many score-downs it adds up to

266
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:52,268
and divide by nine.

267
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:53,769
-Got it.
-Go in for Ash.

268
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:57,148
Substitution! Ash, come out!
You need a breather.

269
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:58,733
Come out?

270
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:01,944
What? l still feel good, Coach.
Let me finish this 8th.

271
00:22:02,028 --> 00:22:04,989
No, come on. Step out, let's go.

272
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:11,203
-Am l getting better, Coach?
-You're sure as cuss not getting worse.

273
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:15,249
You think l could end up being as good
as my dad if l keep practicing?

274
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:19,003
Your dad? Your dad was probably
the best whack-bat player

275
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:21,046
we ever had in this school.

276
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:28,179
Don't compare yourself to that.

277
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:32,600
But l think l have some of the same
raw natural talent, don't you?

278
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:35,686
You're improving, let's put it like that.

279
00:23:01,254 --> 00:23:03,964
-Hot box!
-Divide that by nine, please!

280
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:08,219
That's the first time
this kid's ever swung a whack bat?

281
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:10,596
He really is your father's nephew.

282
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,264
-Not by blood.
-No?

283
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:14,975
-He's from my mother's side.
-Oh, yeah.

284
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:18,145
What's that stand for?

285
00:23:19,105 --> 00:23:21,482
lt's for pep. Pep.

286
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:22,608
lt's a K.

287
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:25,194
Come on now, look alive! That-a-boy!

288
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:27,279
We're going steady.

289
00:23:32,118 --> 00:23:33,118
What's that?

290
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:35,037
What? What, this?

291
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:38,833
Nothing. Just some old trophy l won
for being an athlete.

292
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:42,920
l have to cover a book party
at some animal's nest

293
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:44,505
in a tobacco field down the hill.

294
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:48,175
Kylie and l are going to give it a whirl.
Don't wait up.

295
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,844
What's the book?

296
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:52,972
Some memoir.
l'll get him to sign you a copy.

297
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:55,349
The dinner was pitch perfect.

298
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:06,777
l saw a couple broken burglar bars under
the back door to Bean's secret cider cellar.

299
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,779
-We're breaking into Bean's house?
-Cellar.

300
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:10,739
-Where he lives?
-Where he keeps the cider.

301
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:12,283
Below where he lives.

302
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:14,368
Where'd you come from? Go back
to the tree and do your homework.

303
00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:15,870
l want to help steal cider.

304
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:18,622
We're going to a book party.
And be quiet about any cider,

305
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:20,791
because nobody said that. Now, go!

306
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:23,294
You're going to get me in a lot of trouble.

307
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:25,546
Besides, you're too little
and uncoordinated.

308
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:29,550
One, two, three!

309
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:33,304
Where the cuss does that kid get off?

310
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:35,347
Can you believe that?
How'd he get tipped off?

311
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:39,894
You think he'll tell on us?

312
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:44,315
Before we go on,
can you give me some kind of signal

313
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:46,483
so l know this is getting through to you?

314
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,821
That's it? All right.

315
00:24:50,905 --> 00:24:52,364
There's another one.

316
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:55,451
-Good, you made it. Anybody see you?
-l don't think so.

317
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:57,244
Put this bandit hat on.

318
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:02,499
l'm pleased to be invited,
but l'm not sure l should be doing this.

319
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:05,002
-Why not?
-l don't like to be dishonest with people.

320
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:07,004
Just keep your mouth shut
and it won't be a problem.

321
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:09,590
-l don't think he should come, either.
-We're not taking a vote!

322
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:13,969
One time, this wolf l saw...

323
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:17,056
What's with all the wolf talk?
Give it a rest for once.

324
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:31,654
Look at all this apple juice.

325
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:35,115
Apple juice?
We didn't come here for apple juice.

326
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,036
This is some of the strongest,
finest alcoholic cider money can buy

327
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,080
or that can even be stolen.

328
00:25:41,164 --> 00:25:43,707
lt burns in your throat,
boils in your stomach,

329
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:46,960
and tastes almost exactly
like pure, melted gold.

330
00:25:56,513 --> 00:26:00,307
Y'all are trespassing now, illegally.

331
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:10,401
'Round these parts,
we don't take kindly to cider poachers.

332
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,194
You've aged badly, Rat.

333
00:26:12,987 --> 00:26:16,573
You're getting a little long in the tooth
yourself, partner.

334
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:22,663
Why are you wearing that badge?
What is that?

335
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:25,916
lt's my job.

336
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:42,933
How's your old lady doing?

337
00:26:43,017 --> 00:26:44,935
Do you refer to my wife?

338
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:48,439
She was the town tart in her day.

339
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:50,482
Wild and footloose and

340
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:52,860
pretty as a mink stole.

341
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:54,319
ls that true?

342
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:58,323
Of course not. l mean,
certainly she lived. We all did.

343
00:26:58,408 --> 00:27:01,452
lt was a different time.
Let's not use a double standard.

344
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:03,245
-But town tart?
-Shut up.

345
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:07,416
That was close, Rat. Be careful.

346
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:10,085
Oh, l'm careful as a...

347
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:38,405
How many jars should l bring up, Franklin?

348
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,282
l don't know. Two, l guess.

349
00:27:40,366 --> 00:27:42,409
You drank three yesterday.

350
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:44,578
All right. Take three.

351
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:57,549
Nope. Two is plenty.

352
00:28:02,096 --> 00:28:04,848
Oh, my cuss. ls she blind?

353
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:08,352
She might have astigmatism
or possibly a cataract of some form.

354
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:10,062
Anyway, her eyes don't see well.

355
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:26,787
What'd l tell you? This kid's a natural!
Am l right?

356
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:35,462
So good of you to come.
You both look splendid.

357
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,673
How have you been, Walter?
ln good health?

358
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:40,217
Nathan? All's well?

359
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:41,635
Wonderful.

360
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:44,805
Any fox problems?

361
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:46,473
-Are you joking?
-Horrible.

362
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:47,599
-We're miserable.
-He's laughing at us.

363
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:48,767
-Humiliating.
-We're furious.

364
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:49,977
l don't want to talk about it.

365
00:28:57,777 --> 00:28:59,319
Perhaps we ought to kill him.

366
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:02,906
-That seems obvious.
-He's too sneaky.

367
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:06,660
Right, of course. He's very clever, isn't he?

368
00:29:06,744 --> 00:29:09,329
Might be a bit difficult, l suppose.

369
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:22,217
l've figured out where this fox lives.
Tomorrow night, we'll camp in the bushes,

370
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:25,846
wait for him to come out
and shoot the cuss to smithereens.

371
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,723
How does that grab you?

372
00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:30,142
l don't see why not.

373
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:43,405
Another book party?

374
00:29:45,199 --> 00:29:48,368
l didn't see you sitting in the dark
over there.

375
00:29:49,203 --> 00:29:52,122
Actually, there was a fire.
l just got the call.

376
00:29:52,206 --> 00:29:55,167
May be arson.
l have to interview the marshal...

377
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:58,003
Kylie. ls he telling the truth?

378
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,797
l don't want to be put in the middle of this.

379
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:01,965
Thanks, Kylie.

380
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04,384
Why is he wearing that bandit hat?

381
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:10,223
His ears were cold. He's not with us.
Go back to bed.

382
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:14,811
lf what l think is happening is happening,

383
00:30:15,813 --> 00:30:16,980
it better not be.

384
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,792
Nice job covering for me. Next time...

385
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:52,599
All three!

386
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:53,934
Kill him!

387
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:19,626
We got the tail, but we missed the fox.

388
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:25,716
Petey, sorry to wake you.
Can you dash out here right away

389
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:30,012
with three shovels, two pickaxes,
500 rounds of ammunition,

390
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:31,972
and a bottle of apple cider?

391
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:36,435
-lt'll grow back, won't it?
-Tails don't grow back.

392
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:38,729
-Tails don't grow back?
-Except lizards'.

393
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:42,607
Tails don't grow back. l'm gonna be
tail-less for the rest of my life.

394
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:45,444
Anyway, it's not half as bad
as double pneumonia, right?

395
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:48,613
l mean, his dad has one foot in the grave
and three feet on a banana peel.

396
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:50,532
That's a lot worse than...

397
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:56,079
Excuse me. l'm going to go meditate
for half an hour.

398
00:31:57,623 --> 00:32:00,667
You have 29 minutes
to come up with a proper apology.

399
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,919
Me? Me have an apology?

400
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:06,757
He just got here and got a bandit hat?
Where's my bandit hat?

401
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:11,219
Why didn't l get shot at? Because
you think l'm no good at anything!

402
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:13,180
Maybe you're right, thanks.

403
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:17,476
l told you not to bring him.

404
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:20,103
Why the cuss didn't l listen to my lawyer?

405
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:24,441
We'll be lucky to flip this tree
for half of what we've sunk into it.

406
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:28,945
l can't sleep on my back for 6 weeks
and on my stomach, l feel congested.

407
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:31,406
Why the cuss didn't l listen to my lawyer?

408
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:33,283
Because you don't listen to anybody.

409
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:36,953
-What was that?
-l said...

410
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:38,830
Wake up! They're digging us out!

411
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:41,458
-They'll kill the children.
-Over my dead body.

412
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:44,711
-l know. You're dead, too, in that scenario.
-l'm arguing against that.

413
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,129
-What?
-Why are you yelling?

414
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:50,634
Stop! You say one thing, she says another,
and it all changes back again!

415
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:03,980
l've got it. No time to lose.
Why didn't l think of this sooner?

416
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:05,524
Think of what?

417
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:07,275
We've been trapped before.

418
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:09,986
Dig!

419
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:33,510
l think it's time for me to give a pep talk
and explain some things.

420
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,262
A very long time ago...

421
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:37,472
May l have a word with you privately?

422
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:39,182
Well, we're in a hole here.

423
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:42,602
On the other side of this mineral deposit.
Follow me.

424
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:48,066
l'm going to lose my temper now.

425
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:50,151
-When?
-Right now.

426
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:51,987
Well, when?

427
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,286
Twelve fox-years ago,
you made a promise

428
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:02,289
while we were caged in that fox trap
that, if we survived,

429
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:05,333
you would never steal another chicken,
turkey, goose, duck

430
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:06,877
or squab, whatever they are.

431
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:10,755
Now, l believed you.
Why did you lie to me?

432
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:14,467
Because l'm a wild animal.

433
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,470
You are also a husband, and a father!

434
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:20,599
l'm trying to tell you the truth
about myself.

435
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:23,977
l don't care about the truth about yourself.

436
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:27,439
This story is too predictable.

437
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:31,192
Predictable, really?
What happens in the end?

438
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:34,529
ln the end, we all die.

439
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,449
Unless you change.

440
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:56,927
Petey, run down to the rental department
at Malloy Consolidated and place an order

441
00:34:57,011 --> 00:35:00,972
for one Mighty Max, one Junior Spitfire,

442
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:05,018
and a long-range Tornado 375 Turbo.
For immediate delivery.

443
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:47,394
Ash, are you mad at me?
l understand if you are, and l'm sorry.

444
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:50,605
l wouldn't have involved your cousin
if l'd realized you'd feel this way.

445
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:55,068
lt was only ever because he's kind of
a natural, l mean... Look at him dig!

446
00:35:57,905 --> 00:35:59,280
Anyway, l'm sorry if...

447
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:01,574
l'm going to just put dirt in my ears.

448
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:03,535
That's better. l can't hear you now,
but keep talking.

449
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:28,184
l don't have beagle ticks, by the way.

450
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:32,939
Well, me, neither. Whoever said
we had beagle ticks, by the way?

451
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:36,401
Apparently, that's what you've been
telling everyone. Beagle ticks and pelt lice.

452
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:41,156
l never said that. And you're misquoting
me. But l'll get to the bottom of it.

453
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:44,284
We may or may not ever see
the light of day again,

454
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:46,995
but l really like Agnes
and l think she likes me.

455
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:49,414
Great. She's a free agent. What do l care?

456
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:50,874
Then why are you dead set...

457
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:53,293
-Can l ask you a question?
-You may.

458
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:56,129
What's the point of sitting on the floor
with your legs twisted into a pretzel

459
00:36:56,213 --> 00:36:59,049
talking to yourself
for an hour and 45 minutes? lt's weird.

460
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:02,135
My father and l started meditating
together when...

461
00:37:02,219 --> 00:37:05,680
That's great, but l'd worry more about
what that does to your reputation

462
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:08,141
than whether you have beagle ticks or not.

463
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,603
l don't. Nor pelt lice.

464
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:19,736
One of those slovenly farmers is probably
wearing my tail as a necktie by now.

465
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,071
You're paranoid, Foxy.

466
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:24,324
Farmer, correct me
if l'm misreading the data.

467
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:27,577
You've destroyed the scenery,
but the alleged fox remains at large.

468
00:37:27,661 --> 00:37:29,412
Look at Dad's tie.

469
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:31,748
What will you three prominent farmers
do now?

470
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:34,250
l can tell you what we're not going to do.

471
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:36,169
We're not going to let him go.

472
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:50,683
Stand clear, please. Stand clear, everyone.

473
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:52,602
Contact!

474
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,618
Boggis, how many men work
on your farm?

475
00:38:08,702 --> 00:38:09,744
-35.
-Bunce?

476
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:10,954
-36.
-l've got 37.

477
00:38:11,038 --> 00:38:13,873
That... Carry the zero, divide by two...

478
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:15,708
That's 1 08 all together.

479
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:20,130
Petey, drop everything
and assemble all 1 08 members

480
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:22,340
of our three combined work forces.

481
00:38:22,424 --> 00:38:25,552
We'll starve them out, then kill them.
Starting in

482
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,388
shall we say, 1 5 minutes?

483
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:35,728
An estimated 1 08 snipers are in position,
surrounding the demolished fox residence.

484
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:38,773
Any local animals appear to be
trapped underground

485
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:40,984
without provisions of any kind.

486
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:45,655
lf l had a crystal ball, l'd predict
a fairly grisly outcome to this situation.

487
00:38:45,739 --> 00:38:50,201
We'll stay on the scene, watching closely,
as events continue to unfold.

488
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:55,373
This is going to be a total cluster-cuss
for everybody.

489
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:04,591
How long can a fox go
without food or water?

490
00:39:05,342 --> 00:39:09,012
l can only answer as an opossum, but l
can't last more than another couple hours

491
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:11,514
before l get completely dehydrated
and starve to death.

492
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:12,765
What's that?

493
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:22,108
-Dad.
-Not a sound.

494
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,453
You scared the cuss out of us!

495
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:40,043
A lot of good animals are probably going
to die, because of you!

496
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:44,881
We've been digging in circles for 3 days.

497
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:46,299
Half the woods have been obliterated.

498
00:39:46,383 --> 00:39:49,844
Nobody can get out. My wife's huddled
at the bottom of a flint-mine

499
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:53,556
with no food, no water,
and 27 starving animal brats!

500
00:39:54,808 --> 00:39:58,186
l just want to see a little sunshine.

501
00:39:58,395 --> 00:40:01,773
You're nocturnal, Phil. Your eyes
barely even open on a good day.

502
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:03,983
l'm sick of your double-talk!
We have rights!

503
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:06,402
We don't like you and we hate your dad.

504
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:09,072
Now grab some mud,
chew it and swallow it.

505
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:11,741
-l'm not going to eat mud.
-Cuss, yeah, you are.

506
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:20,792
Don't do that.

507
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:22,627
Why'd you take your shoes off?

508
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:24,921
So l don't break your nose when l kick it.

509
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:36,975
l can fight my own fights.

510
00:40:37,893 --> 00:40:39,102
No, you can't.

511
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:42,772
Those farmers won't quit till they've
got you and every member of your family

512
00:40:42,856 --> 00:40:45,650
nailed upside-down to a bloody stick
with your eyes gorged out.

513
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:49,779
This is getting a little too personal.

514
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:52,532
Give me a minute.

515
00:41:07,881 --> 00:41:09,132
l've got an idea.

516
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:10,425
-What?
-lt could be good.

517
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:12,135
-Lay it on us.
-lt might save our lives.

518
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:13,678
Say the idea!

519
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:16,222
All right. Let's try it.

520
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:21,269
Go to the flint-mine, tell Mrs. Badger et aI.
that help is on the way.

521
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:23,062
ls help on the way?

522
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:25,064
l sure as cuss hope so.

523
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:34,615
Ash, l know what it's like to feel

524
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:37,243
different.

525
00:41:38,495 --> 00:41:39,829
l'm not different.

526
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:41,914
Am l?

527
00:41:42,207 --> 00:41:44,542
We all are. Him, especially.

528
00:41:45,252 --> 00:41:48,379
But there's something kind of fantastic
about that, isn't there?

529
00:41:54,428 --> 00:41:57,180
Not to me. l'd prefer to be an athlete.

530
00:41:59,349 --> 00:42:00,767
Gentlemen,

531
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:04,062
this time we must dig
in a very special direction.

532
00:42:09,234 --> 00:42:11,277
We have to kind of feel out the vibe.

533
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:16,282
Begin.

534
00:42:41,475 --> 00:42:44,644
Come on! You guys... You're not...
Come on.

535
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:53,986
l hit it slap in the middle.
Do you get how incredible this is?

536
00:42:56,740 --> 00:43:00,952
'Bout a handsome little fox
Let me sing you folks a yarn

537
00:43:01,036 --> 00:43:05,540
Hey, diddle-dee, daddle-da,
doddle-do, doodle-dum

538
00:43:05,624 --> 00:43:09,293
'Twas a splendid little fella
Full of wit and grace and charm

539
00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:13,381
Say zippy-zee, zappy-za,
yappy-yo, google-gum

540
00:43:13,465 --> 00:43:18,386
Like any little critter needing
Vittles for his little-uns

541
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:23,808
Well, he stole and he cheated
And he lied just to survive

542
00:43:23,892 --> 00:43:27,103
With a doodle-dum, diddle-di,
duddle, doodle-dum

543
00:43:29,064 --> 00:43:31,107
With a zippy-zo, zippy-zay,
zippy-zappy-zoopy-zee

544
00:43:32,317 --> 00:43:36,946
Oh, doo-dah, doo-dah, day!

545
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:39,240
Let me take a little tick
To color in the scene

546
00:43:39,324 --> 00:43:43,995
'Cross the valley lived three yokels
Name of Boggis, Bunce and Bean

547
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:46,330
These three crazyjackies
Had our hero on the run

548
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:48,457
Shot the tail off the cuss
With a fox-shooting gun

549
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:50,585
But that stylish little fox
Was clever as a whip

550
00:43:50,669 --> 00:43:55,173
Dug as quick as a gopher
That was hyperactive

551
00:43:56,258 --> 00:43:58,467
Now those three farmers sit

552
00:43:58,552 --> 00:44:00,803
'Twhere there a hole 'twas once a hill

553
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:04,473
Singing diddle-dee, daddle-da,
doddle-do, doodle-dum

554
00:44:04,558 --> 00:44:09,228
And as far as l can reckon
They're sitting up there still

555
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:12,815
Singing zippy-zee, zappy-za, yoppy-yo...

556
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,984
What are you singing, Petey?

557
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:19,197
Just making it up as l went along, really.

558
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:24,202
That's just weak songwriting.
You wrote a bad song, Petey!

559
00:44:43,597 --> 00:44:44,972
We took everything!

560
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:47,141
They took everything?

561
00:44:47,893 --> 00:44:50,061
Let me call you back, Petey.

562
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:54,523
-They could be anywhere.
-Digging right under our feet.

563
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:56,275
ln a sense,
we've only made matters worse.

564
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,778
We should have stayed out of it.

565
00:45:30,727 --> 00:45:32,103
l've got an idea.

566
00:45:41,154 --> 00:45:43,531
l still don't have a signal.
ls anybody getting reception?

567
00:45:43,615 --> 00:45:46,367
l don't have any signal,
but l've had a problem with that.

568
00:45:46,451 --> 00:45:49,704
Crisp up those ducks! Drag those
chickens! Slow down. We're ahead.

569
00:45:49,788 --> 00:45:53,374
Where are the apples?
Slice them up and get them in the pan.

570
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:57,545
l can imagine how painful,
even emotionally, that must be for you.

571
00:45:57,629 --> 00:45:59,380
lt's not the end of the world.

572
00:45:59,464 --> 00:46:03,092
But how humiliating, having
your whole tail blown clean off by...

573
00:46:03,176 --> 00:46:04,802
Can we drop it?

574
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:10,433
Yeah, really good, sweet, and nice.

575
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:13,519
They say you're a natural. True or false?

576
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:15,271
Answer the question.

577
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:17,106
-True, l guess.
-Correct.

578
00:46:17,357 --> 00:46:19,650
Get away, Agnes.
l need a private word with Kristofferson.

579
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:23,029
-Just a minute. She...
-l don't mind.

580
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:27,783
l just had a brainstorm
for something fantastic l've got to do.

581
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:29,201
But l can't do it alone.

582
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:30,745
-l'm not interested.
-Hear me out.

583
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:34,623
No, thanks. Foxes from your side
of the family take unnecessary risks.

584
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:38,544
Only because they've got guts
in their blood. So do we.

585
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:41,547
-Was l a bit rude to Agnes?
-Yeah.

586
00:46:41,631 --> 00:46:45,009
l should probably say something.
l will in a minute.

587
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:48,512
-What's the brainstorm?
-ln a nutshell?

588
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:51,182
We're going to steal back my dad's tail.

589
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:04,945
-Okay, chief.
-Here we go.

590
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:21,629
Well, it took a near catastrophe for
all of you to finally take me up on my offer

591
00:47:21,713 --> 00:47:24,131
to have you over
to the flint-mine for dinner.

592
00:47:24,216 --> 00:47:26,759
Maybe my invitation got lost in the mail.

593
00:47:26,843 --> 00:47:29,470
Does anybody know
what he's talking about?

594
00:47:29,554 --> 00:47:33,182
No, Clive's right.
ln all seriousness, excuse me, B.

595
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:38,020
We do have these three ugly farmers
to thank for one thing.

596
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:41,315
Reminding us to be thankful
and aware of each other.

597
00:47:41,399 --> 00:47:43,609
l'll say it again, aware.

598
00:47:57,582 --> 00:48:00,459
-l don't feel safe.
-That's because we're not.

599
00:48:01,294 --> 00:48:03,254
You should put your bandit hat on.

600
00:48:03,338 --> 00:48:06,632
l don't have one,
but l modified this tube sock.

601
00:48:09,344 --> 00:48:11,512
-We look good.
-Yeah, we do.

602
00:48:11,721 --> 00:48:15,349
Now, where would you keep a prized tail,
if you collected them?

603
00:48:15,433 --> 00:48:18,769
-l'd probably hang it over the mantelpiece.
-Right. Good. ln fact...

604
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:21,021
What's that smell?

605
00:48:23,817 --> 00:48:27,069
Ever tasted one of Mrs. Bean's famous
nutmeg-ginger-apple-snaps?

606
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:29,989
Well, how do you do?

607
00:48:37,038 --> 00:48:38,581
They are so warm.

608
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:44,378
We got it wrong.

609
00:48:44,462 --> 00:48:46,297
lt's not over the mantelpiece.

610
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:48,674
The necktie.

611
00:49:15,368 --> 00:49:17,119
-Let's go.
-Hang on.

612
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:18,412
-Two more.
-She's there.

613
00:49:18,496 --> 00:49:20,039
She can't see.

614
00:49:26,588 --> 00:49:29,715
Look at each other. Here we are. Wow.

615
00:49:29,799 --> 00:49:32,301
l've already had too much to drink
and l'm feeling sentimental

616
00:49:32,385 --> 00:49:33,969
but l'll say something anyway,

617
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:37,348
which nobody wants to admit,
but which is probably true.

618
00:49:37,432 --> 00:49:40,351
We beat them. We beat those farmers

619
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:42,895
and now we're triumphantly eating
their roasted chicken,

620
00:49:42,979 --> 00:49:46,106
their sizzling duck, their succulent turkey,
their foie gras...

621
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,152
Where'd the boys go?

622
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:52,821
-Ash! Kristofferson!
-Boys!

623
00:49:54,115 --> 00:49:56,533
That was crazy.
l can't believe what just happened.

624
00:49:56,618 --> 00:49:59,245
Come on, let's get out of here! Let's go!
Where are we?

625
00:50:02,999 --> 00:50:04,333
Kristofferson?

626
00:50:04,584 --> 00:50:08,712
What am l hearing again, baby?
What's happening? Am l still paranoid?

627
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:13,509
Cider.

628
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:39,785
What happened? Something with cider.
That was dangerous. ls anyone hurt?

629
00:50:39,869 --> 00:50:43,163
We're all hurt!
My entire flint-mine got demolished!

630
00:50:43,248 --> 00:50:45,374
Apple juice. Apple juice flood.

631
00:50:45,458 --> 00:50:48,877
Do a head count. Everybody pick a buddy.
Where'd the boys go?

632
00:50:48,962 --> 00:50:51,422
Ash! Kristofferson! Ash!

633
00:50:51,506 --> 00:50:52,756
l'm here!

634
00:50:53,466 --> 00:50:55,509
-Who's your buddy?
-Kristofferson.

635
00:50:55,593 --> 00:50:56,593
-Where is he?
-l don't know.

636
00:50:56,678 --> 00:50:57,720
-Why not?
-l lost him.

637
00:50:57,804 --> 00:50:59,138
You lost him?

638
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:02,558
We were in the kitchen,
trying to find the necktie.

639
00:51:02,642 --> 00:51:04,143
What are you talking about?

640
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:05,477
lt's my fault.

641
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:08,897
Where did you get
that nutmeg-ginger-apple-snap,

642
00:51:08,982 --> 00:51:11,400
and why are you wearing
that fake bandit hat?

643
00:51:11,484 --> 00:51:13,152
We went to steal back your tail.

644
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:17,865
Kristofferson!

645
00:51:25,707 --> 00:51:27,916
Wrap this little mutt in a newspaper

646
00:51:28,001 --> 00:51:30,794
and put him in a box
with some holes punched in the top.

647
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:34,423
There's one way out of the sewer,
but the manhole cover's closed

648
00:51:34,507 --> 00:51:36,175
and a station wagon's parked on it.

649
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:39,345
Which means,
we're permanently stuck down here.

650
00:51:40,013 --> 00:51:42,639
You still think we beat them, Foxy?

651
00:52:00,950 --> 00:52:05,037
Badger's right. These farmers
aren't going to quit until they catch me.

652
00:52:05,121 --> 00:52:06,455
l shouldn't have lied to your face

653
00:52:06,539 --> 00:52:10,751
or fallen off the wagon and started
secretly stealing chickens on the sly.

654
00:52:10,835 --> 00:52:15,297
l shouldn't have tried to embarrass
these farmers and cuss with their heads.

655
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:19,093
l enjoyed it, but l shouldn't have done it.
Now there's only one way out.

656
00:52:19,552 --> 00:52:21,720
lf l hand myself over, let them kill me,

657
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:23,680
stuff me
and hang me over their mantelpiece...

658
00:52:23,765 --> 00:52:27,810
-You'll do no such thing.
-Maybe they'll let everyone else live.

659
00:52:29,437 --> 00:52:32,898
Oh, why did you have to get us
into this, Foxy?

660
00:52:34,776 --> 00:52:38,070
l don't know, but l have a possible theory.

661
00:52:38,154 --> 00:52:40,948
l think l need everyone to think
l'm the greatest,

662
00:52:41,032 --> 00:52:43,992
the "fantastic" Mr. Fox.

663
00:52:44,077 --> 00:52:48,038
lf they aren't completely knocked out
and dazzled and intimidated by me

664
00:52:48,123 --> 00:52:49,790
l don't feel good about myself.

665
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:54,962
Foxes traditionally like to court danger,
hunt prey and outsmart predators.

666
00:52:55,046 --> 00:52:56,922
That's what l'm good at.

667
00:52:58,049 --> 00:52:59,633
At the end of the day, l'm just...

668
00:52:59,717 --> 00:53:02,553
l know. We're wild animals.

669
00:53:04,764 --> 00:53:06,765
l guess we always were.

670
00:53:07,767 --> 00:53:11,603
lf l had all this to do over again,
l'd have never let you down.

671
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:14,398
lt was always more fun
when we did it together, anyway.

672
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:19,278
-l love you, Felicity.
-l love you, too.

673
00:53:21,197 --> 00:53:23,615
But l shouldn't have married you.

674
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:35,878
l tell you about finding out
we were having a cub?

675
00:53:35,962 --> 00:53:37,379
-ln the fox trap.
-Right.

676
00:53:37,464 --> 00:53:39,631
-We were at gunpoint, and your mother...
-Said she's pregnant.

677
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:41,383
Let me tell it, okay?

678
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:45,095
l had no idea how to get out of this jam.
Then it hit me.

679
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:47,055
What do foxes do
better than any other animal?

680
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:48,599
-Dig.
-You're stepping on my lines.

681
00:53:48,683 --> 00:53:50,434
-Keep telling it.
-So we dug.

682
00:53:50,518 --> 00:53:53,896
And the whole time l put paw over paw,
scooping dirt and pebble,

683
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:55,772
your mother digging like crazy next to me,

684
00:53:55,857 --> 00:53:58,734
l kept wondering,
who is this little boy going to be?

685
00:53:58,818 --> 00:53:59,985
-Or girl.
-Or girl.

686
00:54:00,069 --> 00:54:02,029
Because at that point, we didn't know.

687
00:54:02,655 --> 00:54:05,824
Ash, l'm so glad he was you.

688
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:09,745
lt's not your fault. lt's mine.

689
00:54:32,393 --> 00:54:33,685
Good-bye.

690
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:42,778
Well, l guess we should probably split
into a certain number of groups

691
00:54:43,196 --> 00:54:45,656
and start doing something, right?

692
00:54:52,997 --> 00:54:55,207
Could l have a glass of water?

693
00:54:58,086 --> 00:55:00,921
Excuse me. Excuse me!

694
00:55:01,047 --> 00:55:04,883
Kristofferson! Hello! Can you hear us?

695
00:55:06,427 --> 00:55:07,803
Kristofferson!

696
00:55:07,887 --> 00:55:09,555
They got the boy.

697
00:55:14,227 --> 00:55:16,979
They want to trade the son for his poppa.

698
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:24,820
Why did they write this
in letters cut out of magazines?

699
00:55:24,904 --> 00:55:29,324
To protect their identities.
Oh, but then why'd they sign their names?

700
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:31,743
Plus we already knew who they were
because they're trying to kill us.

701
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:36,164
"Mr. Fox, we have your son.
lf you ever want to see him alive again..."

702
00:55:36,249 --> 00:55:38,166
You took the wrong fox!

703
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:42,588
l'm his son.

704
00:55:44,382 --> 00:55:46,425
l can see the resemblance.

705
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:49,595
What was that?

706
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:51,096
Dad!

707
00:56:09,282 --> 00:56:10,949
Stop, man, stop!

708
00:56:18,124 --> 00:56:19,791
Look at you, girl.

709
00:56:20,793 --> 00:56:23,545
You're still as fine-looking
as a crème brûlée.

710
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:27,799
Am l being flirted with by a psychotic rat?

711
00:56:34,807 --> 00:56:36,183
Ash!

712
00:56:36,267 --> 00:56:37,601
Let me out!

713
00:56:38,144 --> 00:56:40,979
Excuse me. May l cut in?

714
00:57:14,055 --> 00:57:16,390
The boy's locked in an apple crate

715
00:57:16,474 --> 00:57:21,269
on top of a gun locker
in the attic of Bean Annex.

716
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:25,357
Would you have told me
if l didn't kill you first?

717
00:57:26,859 --> 00:57:27,943
Never.

718
00:57:29,237 --> 00:57:33,198
All these wasted years.
What were you looking for, Rat?

719
00:57:34,701 --> 00:57:36,702
He's trying to say something, Dad.

720
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:39,413
Cider.

721
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:50,173
Here you are, Rat.
A beaker of Bean's finest secret cider.

722
00:57:54,512 --> 00:57:57,222
Like melted gold.

723
00:58:06,065 --> 00:58:10,068
-He redeemed himself.
-Redemption, sure.

724
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:12,946
But in the end, he's just another dead rat

725
00:58:13,030 --> 00:58:16,074
in a garbage pail
behind a Chinese restaurant.

726
00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:34,342
-He went bananas.
-Yes, he did.

727
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:37,512
My suicide mission has been cancelled.

728
00:58:37,597 --> 00:58:40,098
We're replacing it
with a go-for-broke rescue mission.

729
00:58:42,059 --> 00:58:44,853
ln a way,
l'm almost glad that flood interrupted us,

730
00:58:44,937 --> 00:58:48,607
because l don't like the toast l was giving.
l'm going to start over.

731
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:55,906
When l look down this table,
with the exquisite feast set before us,

732
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:58,116
l see two terrific lawyers,

733
00:58:58,201 --> 00:59:00,202
a skilled pediatrician, a wonderful chef,

734
00:59:00,286 --> 00:59:03,538
a savvy real estate agent,
an excellent tailor, a crack accountant,

735
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:05,832
a gifted musician,
a pretty good minnow fisherman,

736
00:59:05,917 --> 00:59:09,836
and possibly the best landscape painter
working on the scene today.

737
00:59:09,921 --> 00:59:12,631
Maybe a few of you might even
read my column from time to time.

738
00:59:12,715 --> 00:59:14,299
l tend to doubt it.

739
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:18,512
l also see a room full of wild animals.

740
00:59:19,347 --> 00:59:22,849
Wild animals with true natures
and pure talents.

741
00:59:23,309 --> 00:59:27,354
With scientific-sounding Latin names
that mean something about our DNA.

742
00:59:27,772 --> 00:59:31,942
Each with his own strengths
and weaknesses due to his or her species.

743
00:59:33,486 --> 00:59:37,656
Anyway, l think it may very well be
all the beautiful differences among us

744
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:41,243
that might just give us the tiniest glimmer
of a chance of saving my nephew

745
00:59:41,327 --> 00:59:45,622
and letting me make it up to you for
getting us into this crazy whatever-it-is.

746
00:59:45,706 --> 00:59:50,335
l don't know, it's just a thought.
Thank you for listening. Cheers, everyone.

747
00:59:53,839 --> 00:59:55,257
Let's eat!

748
00:59:57,218 --> 00:59:59,803
What? l was just playing along
with the bit he was doing.

749
01:00:01,305 --> 01:00:03,014
Will you join me?

750
01:00:04,183 --> 01:00:05,433
l will.

751
01:00:07,979 --> 01:00:10,522
-Oh, all right, l guess.
-Thank you.

752
01:00:11,691 --> 01:00:13,942
Let's start planning.
Who knows shorthand?

753
01:00:14,026 --> 01:00:17,487
Great. Linda, Lutra Iutra.
You got some dry paper? Here we go.

754
01:00:17,572 --> 01:00:20,448
-Mole, TaIpa europea. What do you got?
-l can see in the dark.

755
01:00:20,533 --> 01:00:22,701
-lncredible. We can use that. Linda?
-Got it.

756
01:00:22,994 --> 01:00:24,995
-Rabbit, Oryctolagus cuniculus.
-l'm fast.

757
01:00:25,079 --> 01:00:26,705
-You bet you are. Linda?
-Got it.

758
01:00:26,914 --> 01:00:28,707
-Beaver, Castor fiber.
-l chew through wood.

759
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:30,083
-Amazing! Linda!
-Got it.

760
01:00:30,376 --> 01:00:32,586
-Badger, Meles meles!
-Demolitions expert.

761
01:00:32,670 --> 01:00:35,797
-What? Since when?
-Explosions, flames, burning things!

762
01:00:35,881 --> 01:00:37,841
-Demolitions expert. Okay, Linda?
-Got it.

763
01:00:38,092 --> 01:00:41,386
-Weasel, Mustela nivalis!
-Stop yelling!

764
01:00:43,514 --> 01:00:45,390
Ash, get these little kids organized

765
01:00:45,474 --> 01:00:48,518
and put together a K.P. unit
to keep this sewer clean.

766
01:00:48,603 --> 01:00:49,644
lt's good for morale.

767
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:53,398
-Done. What's K.P.?
-Um, l think it means janitors.

768
01:00:56,569 --> 01:01:00,614
Me. Yo, over here, hey.
l want to go. l want to fight.

769
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:05,118
Good. Fabulous. Microtus pennsylvanicus.

770
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:11,249
l didn't get a job yet. Or a Latin name.
What's my strength?

771
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:14,669
Listen, you're Kylie.
You're an unbelievably nice guy.

772
01:01:14,754 --> 01:01:17,672
Yourjob is really
just to be available, l think.

773
01:01:17,757 --> 01:01:20,759
l don't know your Latin name. l doubt
they had opossums in ancient Rome.

774
01:01:30,519 --> 01:01:32,562
-lt's stupendous! Where's us?
-Right here.

775
01:01:32,647 --> 01:01:33,980
Paint an X.

776
01:01:36,275 --> 01:01:38,193
Dear Farmers Boggis, Bunce and Bean:

777
01:01:38,277 --> 01:01:40,695
l have no alternative
but to agree to your terms.

778
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:42,697
Move the station wagon
and open the manhole cover

779
01:01:42,782 --> 01:01:45,116
below the drainpipe by the cobbler shop

780
01:01:45,201 --> 01:01:48,411
and meet me there at 10:00 A.M. sharp.
l will hand myself over to you

781
01:01:48,496 --> 01:01:52,040
in exchange for the boy's safe return.
Cordially, Mr. Fox.

782
01:01:53,209 --> 01:01:55,919
Why'd he write this
in letters cut out of magazines?

783
01:01:56,003 --> 01:01:58,046
l don't know, but you did the same thing.

784
01:01:58,130 --> 01:02:01,383
l don't trust this guy.
Anyway, set up the ambush.

785
01:02:01,634 --> 01:02:05,470
Synchronize your clocks.
The time is now 9:45 A.M.

786
01:02:06,430 --> 01:02:11,334
Put these bandit hats on.

787
01:03:03,821 --> 01:03:05,321
Did you bring the boy?

788
01:03:05,906 --> 01:03:09,242
Of course we did. Say something, kid.

789
01:03:10,411 --> 01:03:12,871
Excuse me. Excuse me!

790
01:03:13,289 --> 01:03:16,708
That doesn't sound anything like him.
lt's amateur night in Dixie.

791
01:03:25,843 --> 01:03:27,969
What the cuss is he burning?

792
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:43,401
ls that all you've got, Mr. Fox?

793
01:03:53,662 --> 01:03:55,246
lt's unclear whether these...

794
01:04:13,182 --> 01:04:15,600
28 pinecones fired, 22 targets hit.

795
01:04:19,605 --> 01:04:21,105
Decoy phase, go.

796
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:23,942
Yes, sir. Domino Santo, one, two, three.

797
01:04:37,790 --> 01:04:38,915
Dad's on fire!

798
01:04:42,086 --> 01:04:45,213
-Foxy, you're on.
-We're ready.

799
01:04:46,298 --> 01:04:49,133
-l'm going to find him and bring him back.
-l know you will.

800
01:04:50,469 --> 01:04:51,719
Contact!

801
01:05:06,694 --> 01:05:08,403
Are you scared of wolves?

802
01:05:08,487 --> 01:05:10,613
No. l have a phobia of them.

803
01:05:10,698 --> 01:05:13,783
-l have a thing about thunder.
-Why? That's stupid.

804
01:05:13,868 --> 01:05:15,910
l don't like needles myself.

805
01:05:15,995 --> 01:05:18,162
Where'd you come from again?
How did you get in the sidecar?

806
01:05:18,247 --> 01:05:19,664
l feel like l'm losing my mind.

807
01:05:23,168 --> 01:05:25,837
l've got a fox on a motorcycle,
with a littler fox

808
01:05:25,921 --> 01:05:28,423
and what looks like to be
an opossum in the sidecar,

809
01:05:28,507 --> 01:05:30,383
riding north on Farm Lane Seven.

810
01:05:30,968 --> 01:05:33,011
Does that sound like anything to anybody?

811
01:05:33,095 --> 01:05:34,554
Red, it's Franklin Bean.

812
01:05:34,638 --> 01:05:38,516
Turn around, get the cuss back here
and pick us up on the ASAP.

813
01:06:10,132 --> 01:06:12,133
-You got a credit card?
-Sure.

814
01:06:12,217 --> 01:06:15,345
This is what l was saying about
how good you are, just being available.

815
01:06:15,429 --> 01:06:19,015
A titanium card?
How the cuss did you qualify for this?

816
01:06:19,099 --> 01:06:21,601
l pay my bills on time.
l've always had good credit.

817
01:06:29,818 --> 01:06:30,860
Come on.

818
01:06:30,945 --> 01:06:34,739
What's this thing you do?
The whistle with the clicking sound?

819
01:06:35,741 --> 01:06:37,492
What do you mean? That's my trademark.

820
01:07:09,316 --> 01:07:10,984
Give me a blueberry.

821
01:07:12,695 --> 01:07:14,195
-Blueberry.
-You didn't say anything...

822
01:07:14,279 --> 01:07:18,074
You forgot the blueberries?
l did say it! l wrote it on your paw!

823
01:07:18,450 --> 01:07:20,535
Yeah. lt's written on the front of your paw.

824
01:07:24,123 --> 01:07:27,750
-What's that white stuff around his mouth?
-l think he eats soap.

825
01:07:32,506 --> 01:07:35,466
-That's not soap.
-Then why does he have that bubbly...

826
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:39,262
He's rabid. With rabies.
l've heard about this beagle.

827
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:43,933
You two go ahead while l distract him.

828
01:08:03,829 --> 01:08:05,246
l can fit through there.

829
01:08:06,999 --> 01:08:09,417
-Want to know why?
-Why?

830
01:08:10,210 --> 01:08:12,003
Because l'm little.

831
01:08:12,713 --> 01:08:14,172
Give me that shoelace.

832
01:08:24,141 --> 01:08:26,267
lt's me. l'm rescuing you.

833
01:08:28,145 --> 01:08:31,898
-l have mixed feelings about that.
-l don't blame you.

834
01:08:35,527 --> 01:08:38,488
Can you give me a karate lesson
real quick?

835
01:08:39,531 --> 01:08:42,033
Okay. Stand like this.

836
01:08:42,451 --> 01:08:44,243
Position yourself on the balls of your feet.

837
01:08:44,328 --> 01:08:47,455
Close your eyes.
You weigh less than a slice of bread.

838
01:08:49,875 --> 01:08:52,668
l feel there's a tenderness in your eyes,
isn't there?

839
01:08:53,045 --> 01:08:54,337
Yes, l'm right.

840
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:59,342
Let's review the principal agility
techniques: jumping, flipping, landing.

841
01:08:59,635 --> 01:09:03,930
You're a good boy.
A little lonely, maybe, but terribly sweet.

842
01:09:04,389 --> 01:09:07,475
ls your name Spitz?
That's German, isn't it?

843
01:09:08,310 --> 01:09:10,978
Now, a rudimentary version
of the cyclone chop.

844
01:09:11,063 --> 01:09:13,689
First, get a running start,
which, obviously, l can't do here.

845
01:09:13,774 --> 01:09:15,650
Then, at the destination of the chop,

846
01:09:15,734 --> 01:09:18,611
lean and thrust into the point of contact,
paw open and straight,

847
01:09:18,695 --> 01:09:21,364
then withdraw instantaneously.
lt's the pull-back that matters.

848
01:09:21,448 --> 01:09:24,158
The pull-back generates
the force of the impact.

849
01:09:24,743 --> 01:09:25,952
Got it.

850
01:09:27,454 --> 01:09:30,706
Yeah, l'm just going to chop this thing
right off.

851
01:09:40,050 --> 01:09:41,509
He's going to do it.

852
01:09:44,388 --> 01:09:47,557
Why, you're just as sweet as a...

853
01:09:48,934 --> 01:09:51,435
l thought he said
never look a beagle in the eye.

854
01:10:02,364 --> 01:10:05,366
-Did you chop it?
-Oh, no. Oh, no.

855
01:10:19,631 --> 01:10:21,173
Kristofferson.

856
01:10:22,634 --> 01:10:24,302
Uh, l'm okay.

857
01:10:25,512 --> 01:10:28,180
-l'm okay.
-l'm sorry.

858
01:10:28,974 --> 01:10:32,018
That's all right. You were just trying
to unlock the apple crate.

859
01:10:32,811 --> 01:10:35,479
No. l mean l'm sorry about...

860
01:10:36,356 --> 01:10:40,151
Oh, you mean from before. The apology
you owed me, but never actually said.

861
01:10:40,235 --> 01:10:44,947
Right. l'm grumpy. l spit.
l wake up on the wrong side of the bed.

862
01:10:45,032 --> 01:10:48,618
l'm just different, apparently.

863
01:10:48,702 --> 01:10:50,995
But it won't happen again.

864
01:10:52,289 --> 01:10:53,998
Kristofferson, l'm sorry.

865
01:10:56,543 --> 01:10:58,628
Well, that's all right, too.

866
01:10:59,338 --> 01:11:00,588
Throw me the shoelace, please.

867
01:11:12,351 --> 01:11:13,851
You okay?

868
01:11:46,051 --> 01:11:47,385
He's wearing it.

869
01:11:51,556 --> 01:11:56,435
Your tractors uprooted my tree,
your posse hunted my family,

870
01:11:56,561 --> 01:12:01,691
your gunmen kidnapped my nephew,
your rat insulted my wife,

871
01:12:01,858 --> 01:12:04,235
and you shot off my tail.

872
01:12:04,361 --> 01:12:07,446
l'm not leaving here without that necktie.

873
01:12:08,782 --> 01:12:10,116
Kill him!

874
01:12:18,875 --> 01:12:21,293
Actually, we should just go.
Where did l park?

875
01:12:21,878 --> 01:12:23,879
l weigh less than a slice of bread.

876
01:12:24,798 --> 01:12:26,841
-l'll be right back.
-Ash!

877
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:39,103
Dodge the grabbers, duck the taggers,
jump the twig-basket and

878
01:12:39,187 --> 01:12:40,896
knock the cedar-stick off the cross-rock!

879
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,375
Hot box!

880
01:13:30,655 --> 01:13:34,825
Ash, that was pure wild animal craziness.
You're an athlete.

881
01:13:36,578 --> 01:13:38,829
Here, put this bandit hat on.

882
01:13:41,958 --> 01:13:43,292
Goggles.

883
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:54,303
Are you going to...

884
01:13:56,932 --> 01:14:01,560
Holy swearing cuss!

885
01:14:11,988 --> 01:14:13,739
Petey, bring us a ladder, please.

886
01:14:14,741 --> 01:14:15,991
Stand by!

887
01:14:16,076 --> 01:14:18,953
l just intercepted
a high-frequency radio signal with the can,

888
01:14:19,037 --> 01:14:20,538
they're on their way home!

889
01:14:29,756 --> 01:14:32,258
Don't turn around.

890
01:14:41,601 --> 01:14:43,477
Where'd he come from?

891
01:14:44,729 --> 01:14:46,438
Where'd you come from?

892
01:14:47,774 --> 01:14:49,775
What are you doing here?

893
01:14:51,236 --> 01:14:52,862
Canis lupus.

894
01:14:53,613 --> 01:14:55,281
Vulpes vulpes.

895
01:14:57,075 --> 01:14:59,201
l don't think he speaks English or Latin.

896
01:15:03,832 --> 01:15:06,584
l'm asking if he thinks
we're in for a hard winter.

897
01:15:10,380 --> 01:15:12,381
He doesn't seem to know.

898
01:15:14,593 --> 01:15:16,927
l have a phobia of wolves!

899
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:36,280
What a beautiful creature.
Wish him luck, boys.

900
01:15:36,656 --> 01:15:38,824
-Good luck, wolf.
-Good luck out there.

901
01:16:01,139 --> 01:16:04,141
These three, in this reporter's opinion,
obsessed farmers

902
01:16:04,226 --> 01:16:08,812
remain convinced the fox in question
will eventually reappear. Why?

903
01:16:09,064 --> 01:16:11,357
-Foxes aren't meant to live in a sewer.
-They're refugees.

904
01:16:11,441 --> 01:16:14,443
-All they have to eat down there is...
-Trash!

905
01:16:14,819 --> 01:16:16,487
And not much of it.

906
01:16:17,948 --> 01:16:22,243
Thank you, farmers.
For Action 1 2, this is Dan Peabody.

907
01:16:24,663 --> 01:16:26,914
-What is it?
-His tonsils are a little swollen.

908
01:16:26,998 --> 01:16:29,667
-ls it serious?
-No. Hopefully, he won't have to lose them.

909
01:16:29,751 --> 01:16:31,210
Lose the tonsils?

910
01:16:31,753 --> 01:16:35,965
-l'm hungry.
-Have some water. Here.

911
01:16:36,049 --> 01:16:37,925
We try to keep things simple.

912
01:16:38,009 --> 01:16:41,512
This is the first time l've been to a party
where no one serves anything.

913
01:16:54,859 --> 01:16:56,485
My darlings.

914
01:16:57,821 --> 01:16:59,280
-Where are we going?
-Nobody knows.

915
01:16:59,364 --> 01:17:01,031
We were in the middle
of a meditation practice.

916
01:17:01,116 --> 01:17:04,118
Watch your step.
Let's see, where does this lead?

917
01:17:04,202 --> 01:17:06,578
Oh, no. Foxy, it's filthy.

918
01:17:06,663 --> 01:17:09,123
-Keep a good grip, everyone.
-This better be worth it.

919
01:17:09,207 --> 01:17:14,211
l think l see a little sliver of light.
What's this? ls it a door?

920
01:17:14,504 --> 01:17:16,297
You're a terrible actor, Foxy.

921
01:17:16,381 --> 01:17:19,174
Do you smell something? ls that Freon?

922
01:17:19,884 --> 01:17:23,095
l'm going to open this trap door
and see if something's on the other side.

923
01:17:23,179 --> 01:17:26,223
l highly doubt it, though.
There's probably just more sewer.

924
01:17:26,933 --> 01:17:28,892
-Wouldn't it be surprising if...
-Open it.

925
01:17:36,568 --> 01:17:40,529
Look, there's a whole enormous, glorious,
gigantic supermarket up here.

926
01:17:40,822 --> 01:17:43,240
And they close early on weekends.

927
01:17:47,203 --> 01:17:51,665
You really are kind of a quote-unquote
"fantastic" fox.

928
01:17:51,750 --> 01:17:54,418
l try. Get enough to share with everybody.

929
01:17:54,502 --> 01:17:58,088
Remember, the Rabbits are vegetarians
and Badger supposedly can't eat walnuts.

930
01:18:00,508 --> 01:18:03,927
l guess now that Kristofferson's dad
is already down to single pneumonia

931
01:18:04,012 --> 01:18:06,013
he'll be going home soon.

932
01:18:06,097 --> 01:18:08,098
Actually, when he spoke to me
from the hospital

933
01:18:08,183 --> 01:18:09,350
he said he was already talking to Weasel

934
01:18:09,434 --> 01:18:12,186
about real estate availability
in our sewer system.

935
01:18:12,270 --> 01:18:14,229
Really? Well, now's the time to buy.

936
01:18:22,781 --> 01:18:25,032
Okay. l get it. ls that your trademark?

937
01:18:28,620 --> 01:18:31,789
-l'm pregnant again.
-Wow.

938
01:18:33,958 --> 01:18:35,834
l think we're both glowing.

939
01:18:39,381 --> 01:18:40,881
Do another toast, Dad.

940
01:18:42,842 --> 01:18:44,343
Okay, uh...

941
01:18:52,394 --> 01:18:55,979
They say all foxes
are slightly allergic to linoleum.

942
01:18:56,064 --> 01:18:58,482
But it's cool to the paw. Try it.

943
01:19:01,444 --> 01:19:04,488
They say my tail needs to be dry-cleaned
twice a month.

944
01:19:04,864 --> 01:19:06,240
But now it's fully detachable.

945
01:19:06,324 --> 01:19:07,324
See?

946
01:19:08,368 --> 01:19:13,163
They say our tree may never grow back.
But one day something will.

947
01:19:14,833 --> 01:19:17,251
These crackles
are made of synthetic goose

948
01:19:17,335 --> 01:19:19,753
and these giblets
come from artificial squab.

949
01:19:19,838 --> 01:19:23,590
Even these apples look fake.
But at least they've got stars on them.

950
01:19:25,218 --> 01:19:29,388
My point is, we'll eat tonight,
and we'll eat together.

951
01:19:29,472 --> 01:19:32,808
And even in this
not particularly flattering light,

952
01:19:33,726 --> 01:19:38,439
you are without a doubt the 5½
most wonderful wild animals

953
01:19:38,523 --> 01:19:40,816
l've ever met in my life.

954
01:19:42,068 --> 01:19:43,819
So let's raise our boxes.

955
01:19:46,948 --> 01:19:49,867
To our survival.

956
01:19:56,416 --> 01:19:57,875
How was that?

957
01:19:59,210 --> 01:20:01,128
That was a good toast.

958
01:26:43,030 --> 01:26:44,072
English - US
