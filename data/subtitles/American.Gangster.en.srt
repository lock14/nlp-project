1
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,069
Happy thanksgiving!

2
00:01:54,939 --> 00:01:55,930
Come here!

3
00:01:59,609 --> 00:02:00,670
Yeah! right here!

4
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,439
Toss me a bird, bumpy!

5
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:03,980
Woman 1: bumpy!

6
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:07,250
Yeah! woman 2: bumpy! we love you!

7
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:08,949
There you go, darling.

8
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,349
Woman 3: over here! over here!

9
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:17,759
Frank! come on!

10
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,420
Come here.

11
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:36,409
This is the problem. this is what's wrong with America.

12
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,740
It's gotten so big, you just can't find your way.

13
00:02:41,659 --> 00:02:45,650
The grocery store on the corner is now a supermarket.

14
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:49,090
The candy store is a mcdonald's.

15
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:54,129
And this place, a super-fucking discount store.

16
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,439
Where's the pride of ownership, huh?

17
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,639
Where's the personal service?

18
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:10,439
You see what I mean? shit.

19
00:03:12,949 --> 00:03:16,949
I mean, what right do they have, of cutting out the suppliers,

20
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:20,490
Pushing out all the middlemen,

21
00:03:21,129 --> 00:03:24,620
Buying direct from the manufacturer?

22
00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:29,430
Sony this, toshiba that.

23
00:03:29,569 --> 00:03:33,469
All them chinks putting Americans out of work.

24
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:42,270
That's the way it is now.

25
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:47,710
You all right?

26
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,620
You can't find the heart of anything

27
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:54,460
To stick the knife.

28
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:57,960
Hey!

29
00:03:58,569 --> 00:04:00,330
Anybody here?

30
00:04:00,969 --> 00:04:01,960
Can I help you?

31
00:04:02,069 --> 00:04:03,430
Call an ambulance.

32
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:05,270
Forget it, frank.

33
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:09,039
There's no one in charge.

34
00:04:14,009 --> 00:04:15,680
Call an ambulance!

35
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:19,319
Some say bumpy johnson was a great man,

36
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,509
According to the eulogies, a giving man,

37
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:22,779
A man of the people.

38
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:24,550
No one chose to use in their remembrances

39
00:04:24,689 --> 00:04:26,629
The word most often associated with

40
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:28,790
Ellsworth "bumpy" johnson, "gangster,"

41
00:04:28,899 --> 00:04:32,490
Whose passing has brought a who's who of mourners on this chilly afternoon.

42
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,029
Lucchese mob boss dominic cattano,

43
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:36,829
Harlem crime figure nicky barnes.

44
00:04:36,939 --> 00:04:38,000
Nicky! nicky!

45
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,230
From the political arena,

46
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:41,740
The governor has come down, the mayor of new york,

47
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:46,209
And chief of police and commissioner, sports and entertainment luminaries.

48
00:04:46,579 --> 00:04:49,519
Reporter 2: bumpy johnson, age 62 when he passed,

49
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:53,139
Was a folk hero among harlem locals for over four decades.

50
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,620
Regarded by some as the robin hood of harlem,

51
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,590
By others as a ruthless criminal...

52
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,420
I don't understand, you know.

53
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,759
I would've thought that bumpy would put out a better spread, you know?

54
00:05:03,899 --> 00:05:05,730
You want something? no, thanks.

55
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,490
I want chicken wings at my funeral.

56
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,089
All right, nicky barnes. who is that?

57
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,930
He didn't know what hit him, you know what I'm saying?

58
00:05:12,069 --> 00:05:14,370
I just kept popping him in the face 'cause that's what I do.

59
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:22,879
I don't have a lighter. you have a light?

60
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,050
Okay?

61
00:05:35,459 --> 00:05:37,120
That's very good.

62
00:05:37,659 --> 00:05:38,959
Hey, frank.

63
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,069
Go get me a light while you're at it.

64
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,100
Appreciate it.

65
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:49,310
Don cattano.

66
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,500
Hey, how you doing, rossi?

67
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:52,909
Good.

68
00:05:53,009 --> 00:05:54,379
Would you like a drink, sir?

69
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,250
Give him a scotch on the rocks.

70
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,209
Come on. come on.

71
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:15,459
I know you're hurting, frank.

72
00:06:16,339 --> 00:06:17,430
So am I.

73
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,100
I'm all right.

74
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:21,730
You gonna be all right? yeah.

75
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,480
I'm sure bumpy didn't say anything to you, but he made me promise

76
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:26,839
That if anything ever happened to him,

77
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,970
That I should make sure that you want for nothing.

78
00:06:31,449 --> 00:06:33,079
I appreciate that.

79
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,420
You know, half the people in this room owed bumpy money when he died.

80
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:40,649
They think I'm gonna forget to collect, but I'm gonna get that money.

81
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:43,850
Well, that's the spirit. go get 'em.

82
00:06:47,129 --> 00:06:50,930
Mr. roberts, taking the prosecution's side,

83
00:06:50,939 --> 00:06:55,069
Give us us v. mead, subject, issues, what the determination was

84
00:06:55,209 --> 00:06:57,680
And what it means to us today.

85
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:02,639
Class, you'll be critiquing Mr. roberts, so pay attention.

86
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:07,079
I hate hearing my name called, you know?

87
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:10,120
It means I gotta get up in front of the class, I gotta turn around,

88
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:14,319
And I know every one of those people there, they know more than I do.

89
00:07:14,459 --> 00:07:18,420
The number one fear of people, it ain't dying, it's public speaking.

90
00:07:18,529 --> 00:07:19,930
I get physically ill, I wanna throw up.

91
00:07:20,029 --> 00:07:21,829
And that's what you wanna do for a living.

92
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:24,100
No, I don't wanna be like that, man, I wanna beat it.

93
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:25,259
So, should I do this?

94
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:27,769
No, he'll take it from me, he knows me. I've known him since high school.

95
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:30,310
From high school? good morning. yeah.

96
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:32,500
He doesn't take it, just throw it in. it's good service.

97
00:07:32,649 --> 00:07:35,110
Throw it in? all right. yeah.

98
00:07:36,149 --> 00:07:38,009
What's up, susie? hey, jay.

99
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,019
How you doing, baby? all right.

100
00:07:40,149 --> 00:07:41,480
All right. ready?

101
00:07:59,069 --> 00:08:00,160
Hey! that's his head!

102
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:11,779
You're supposed to be my friend, asshole!

103
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,279
I swear to god, richie, I didn't know it was you.

104
00:08:15,389 --> 00:08:18,480
I would never slam a door on your hand, knowingly.

105
00:08:18,589 --> 00:08:19,750
You bit my fucking hand.

106
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,560
What are you doing serving subpoenas, anyway?

107
00:08:21,699 --> 00:08:23,660
We're on loan to county. county?

108
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,819
How's that working out for you? hey, fuck you.

109
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:30,029
Hey, I'm sorry. consider me served. can we leave it there?

110
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:33,039
Assault on a police officer? I don't think so.

111
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:35,399
Hey, for old times' sake. what can we do?

112
00:08:35,509 --> 00:08:36,870
What do you want? what can I give you?

113
00:08:37,009 --> 00:08:39,240
What do you get for assault with a deadly weapon, jay?

114
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:41,240
Five years minimum. five years.

115
00:08:41,379 --> 00:08:45,509
Guys, come on. no, guys. what do you want? who do you want?

116
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:47,080
Who do you got?

117
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:51,820
You want big al's bookie? you want his accountant? I'll give him to you.

118
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,429
Stop, stop, stop.

119
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,700
There he is.

120
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:09,370
That's him. that's the bookie.

121
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,210
All right, carlo, get lost.

122
00:09:11,309 --> 00:09:12,899
Get out of the car.

123
00:09:13,049 --> 00:09:16,850
This is... I'd rather not. come on. let's go.

124
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:18,679
Take it ease.

125
00:09:38,309 --> 00:09:40,299
Want to stay with him or the car?

126
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,909
Let's see who comes for the car.

127
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,120
Think he made us?

128
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:01,929
You called in the warrants, right? so, where are they?

129
00:10:02,129 --> 00:10:03,620
I just called, man.

130
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:07,559
I called and walked back here and 10 seconds has gone by.

131
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:11,899
I saw him with the slips, jay.

132
00:10:12,009 --> 00:10:15,669
You saw policy slips? you saw grocery bags. you don't know what's in 'em.

133
00:10:15,809 --> 00:10:18,179
Yes, I do and so do you. don't give me that bull.

134
00:10:18,309 --> 00:10:21,279
What's the rush, richie? half an hour, the warrant will be here.

135
00:10:21,379 --> 00:10:23,220
I got night school, all right? guess you're gonna miss it.

136
00:10:32,789 --> 00:10:34,590
Fuck this. come on. you sure?

137
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:36,559
Yeah, I'm sure. let's go.

138
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,049
Fuck.

139
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,179
Jay. yeah?

140
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:41,860
Fuck.

141
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,500
Wbz, honey bunch, the show they all love!

142
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,899
It's the groovy sound of the jefferson kaye saturday night show.

143
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:53,200
Dig, honey, it's coming up time for news.

144
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:55,970
Jumping on the ceiling, wallpaper peeling on wbz.

145
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,340
Stick around, the jace-man's got 10. back in 10.

146
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,639
It's not just a couple of bucks, all right?

147
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,379
It's the same thing in principle.

148
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,690
Oh, are we talking principles?

149
00:12:11,789 --> 00:12:15,250
Richie, a cop who turns in this kind of money, says one thing.

150
00:12:15,629 --> 00:12:19,090
He turns in cops who take money. we'll be fucking pariahs.

151
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:20,669
Yeah, well, then we're fucked both ways.

152
00:12:20,769 --> 00:12:23,529
Not if we keep it. only if we don't, then you're right, we're fucked.

153
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:25,539
But not if we keep it.

154
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,840
God damn it, man! did we ask for this?

155
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,909
Did we put a gun to someone's head and say, "give us your money"?

156
00:12:32,049 --> 00:12:35,779
Cops kill cops they can't trust.

157
00:12:39,389 --> 00:12:41,409
We can't turn it in, man.

158
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:52,529
Can you believe that?

159
00:13:01,509 --> 00:13:03,139
How much is it?

160
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:06,080
$987,000.

161
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,450
Well, what happened to the rest of it?

162
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:14,080
What the hell are you doing

163
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:15,379
Counting it out here in front of everybody?

164
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:16,480
Are you nuts?

165
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:22,289
Get it back in the bags, seal them up and down into the property room.

166
00:13:31,539 --> 00:13:33,559
You fucking boy scout.

167
00:13:57,659 --> 00:14:00,789
What? what?

168
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:26,789
Detective trupo, sign here.

169
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,759
You guys ready to make a lot of fucking money?

170
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:34,059
Man 1: always. man 2: hell, yeah.

171
00:14:34,169 --> 00:14:35,429
Fucking a.

172
00:14:37,899 --> 00:14:39,100
Oh, look at this.

173
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:40,330
There you go.

174
00:14:41,009 --> 00:14:43,840
All right, look at this. man 2: fucking beautiful.

175
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,809
There's three more boats.

176
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,509
Hey, don't lose any of that shit.

177
00:14:55,659 --> 00:14:57,950
Man 1: I know. all right, be careful.

178
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:03,460
Hey! just enough for the reagent test.

179
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:06,960
A little less.

180
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:14,970
This is the french connection dope.

181
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:19,370
Kilos of the same dope eddie egan and sonny grosso took from us.

182
00:15:19,509 --> 00:15:21,740
The cops seize it, arrest everyone,

183
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:24,250
Then they start taking it out of the evidence room,

184
00:15:24,379 --> 00:15:27,840
Whacking it down to nothing and selling it back to us.

185
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:30,350
They basically control the market with it.

186
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:33,019
Mr. rossi, I have a surprise for you.

187
00:15:33,129 --> 00:15:36,149
They've been doing it for years now. they live off it, our dope.

188
00:15:36,259 --> 00:15:37,250
What do you think?

189
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:39,259
What the fuck is happening to the world, frank?

190
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,360
Those fucking crooks.

191
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:43,830
Yeah. sad about bumpy.

192
00:15:46,309 --> 00:15:48,570
Things are never gonna be the same in harlem.

193
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:53,700
You walk down the street, nobody bothers you 'cause bumpy was making sure of it.

194
00:15:53,909 --> 00:15:55,350
Half a key.

195
00:15:55,879 --> 00:15:57,509
How is your day now?

196
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,580
It's chaos. every gorilla for hisself.

197
00:16:03,259 --> 00:16:04,919
Motherfucker!

198
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,360
Who can live like that? there has to be order.

199
00:16:11,629 --> 00:16:13,600
That would never happen with italians.

200
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:17,429
More important than any one man's life, is order.

201
00:16:25,649 --> 00:16:26,809
Frank.

202
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:30,409
Hey. come on in, claude. sit down.

203
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,480
How y'all doing, huh? good.

204
00:16:37,659 --> 00:16:39,019
So, you see nate over there? yeah?

205
00:16:39,129 --> 00:16:40,419
Yeah, all the time.

206
00:16:40,529 --> 00:16:42,590
Nate is everywhere. he's good. yeah.

207
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,889
He's still over there? yeah. he's got himself a club now.

208
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,429
Okay. whereabouts, saigon? bangkok.

209
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,929
Bangkok? I don, t think he, s ever coming home.

210
00:16:54,909 --> 00:16:55,970
Come on.

211
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,269
On the house, for our boys in uniform.

212
00:17:25,369 --> 00:17:28,309
Thank you, sugar. that's very kind.

213
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,170
Thank frank.

214
00:17:30,309 --> 00:17:31,779
Thanks, frank.

215
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:34,769
Just relax.

216
00:17:35,849 --> 00:17:39,250
You have to boot this shit a couple of times.

217
00:17:39,619 --> 00:17:42,990
The cops keep cutting it, selling the shit.

218
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:48,190
I don't want to say anything, cause the price is right,

219
00:17:48,329 --> 00:17:51,490
But that shit in nam is way,

220
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:56,289
Way heavy.

221
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:23,289
Did you ain't seen the jar, frank, hmm?

222
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,519
I think you walked right past it.

223
00:18:26,329 --> 00:18:30,230
The money jar, frank. what do I gotta do, put a fucking sign on it?

224
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:36,829
Look at this nigger right here. you know, frank,

225
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:39,140
bumpy don't own 116th no more.

226
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,140
bumpy don't own no real estate in harlem right now.

227
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:44,049
I'm the landlord and the lease is 20%% .

228
00:18:45,619 --> 00:18:48,880
Look, don't sell dope then, frank. get a real job.

229
00:18:49,019 --> 00:18:52,150
You need a fucking job, frank? hmm? is that what you need?

230
00:18:52,259 --> 00:18:53,589
Well, you can come work for me.

231
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:56,700
Okay? you can drive me around, huh? you can open my doors.

232
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:01,930
Huh? "yes, sir", "no, sir", "right away, sir", "anything you want, massa johnson".

233
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,730
20%
Twenty percent.

234
00:19:12,809 --> 00:19:15,509
Twenty percent is my profit, tango.

235
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:19,579
If I give you that, then what do I got left? nothing, man.

236
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,119
Twenty percent puts me out of business,

237
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,089
And every somebody you know out of business.

238
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:26,549
There's legitimate ways of doing things, tango, and then there's this way.

239
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,849
Not even bumpy took 20%% .

240
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,900
bumpy's fucking dead.

241
00:19:34,329 --> 00:19:35,630
My man.

242
00:19:36,099 --> 00:19:37,400
Twenty percent?

243
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:48,009
Twenty percent. doc, let's go.

244
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:08,930
Out. good job. sit.

245
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,470
A leader, like a shepherd,

246
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,609
He sends his fastest nimble sheep, out front.

247
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:19,539
And the others will follow.

248
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:23,079
While the shepherd, he walks quietly behind it.

249
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,740
Here, boy! here we go. right here.

250
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:26,339
Bring it here. yeah.

251
00:20:27,289 --> 00:20:31,519
Now he's got the stick, and the cane, he'll use it!

252
00:20:32,259 --> 00:20:33,990
If he has to.

253
00:20:34,089 --> 00:20:36,430
But most times he doesn't have to.

254
00:20:36,529 --> 00:20:40,299
He moves the whole herd quietly.

255
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,609
What right do they have cutting out the supplier?

256
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:50,369
The middleman. buying direct.

257
00:20:52,279 --> 00:20:55,039
Putting Americans out of work.

258
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:58,009
That's the way it is now, frank.

259
00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:02,390
That's the way it is.

260
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:22,869
The drug problem in vietnam is more than marijuana.

261
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:25,210
At this point, it is estimated that one third

262
00:21:25,309 --> 00:21:27,509
Of American troops are experimenting

263
00:21:27,609 --> 00:21:29,440
With opium and heroin.

264
00:21:30,049 --> 00:21:32,019
The authorities say they have confiscated

265
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:35,650
Large quantities of marijuana, heroin and pills.

266
00:21:36,019 --> 00:21:38,859
Every person and every vehicle going through the gates

267
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,019
Is subject to a thorough shakedown.

268
00:21:41,079 --> 00:21:45,079
Soldiers have access to the drugs at many rest and relaxation spots

269
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:49,240
In bangkok, saigon and other areas throughout vietnam and thailand.

270
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:53,480
Officials say the easy availability, relatively cheap cost

271
00:21:53,589 --> 00:21:57,250
And high purity of heroin throughout saigon and the far east,

272
00:21:57,390 --> 00:22:01,829
Is leading to an epidemic of heroin addiction among us soldiers.

273
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:07,059
Operator. yeah, international.

274
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,430
What city? bangkok.

275
00:22:09,569 --> 00:22:12,339
You know the country code? yeah, 376.

276
00:22:12,609 --> 00:22:14,130
For the first three minutes, it'll be...

277
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,009
I got it, I got it. I got it.

278
00:22:21,779 --> 00:22:22,769
Hello?

279
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,410
Soul brothers. hey, can I help you?

280
00:22:24,549 --> 00:22:25,710
Nate.

281
00:22:26,119 --> 00:22:28,059
Do I know you? yeah, it's me.

282
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,779
Your cousin, negro.

283
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:36,759
Go on, get yourself a new suit.

284
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:15,029
Look, I'm sorry.

285
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,500
Oh, please, richie.

286
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:20,269
It couldn't be avoided. I'll take him next weekend, all right?

287
00:23:20,809 --> 00:23:22,329
We're moving.

288
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,450
What? where?

289
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:28,470
The st. regis. what do you care?

290
00:23:30,819 --> 00:23:32,289
To my sister's.

291
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:34,690
Your sister's? in vegas? yeah.

292
00:23:34,819 --> 00:23:37,490
You are not moving to las vegas. not with michael, anyway.

293
00:23:38,829 --> 00:23:41,920
What am I supposed to do with him, leave him with you? there's a picture.

294
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,000
Hey, guys! be cool.

295
00:23:47,539 --> 00:23:51,029
Laurie, las vegas is not the kind of place that you raise a kid.

296
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:54,339
Oh, like this is a good environment? and around your friends?

297
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,269
When am I supposed to see my boy?

298
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:58,609
This weekend. last weekend.

299
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:01,609
God damn it.

300
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,339
Hey! I asked you nice to shut up, right?

301
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:05,609
Now I'm gonna have to kill you.

302
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,880
I swear I will pull out my gun and put a bullet in your fucking heads!

303
00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:11,049
Now stop what you're doing and pick up the glass!

304
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:12,819
Calm down, man. okay, be cool.

305
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:17,700
Fucking crazy, man.

306
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:20,690
You don't have a gun.

307
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:24,970
You sure?

308
00:24:33,049 --> 00:24:34,880
You are crazy, richie.

309
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:41,349
You don't have room for us.

310
00:24:43,059 --> 00:24:44,890
I'll see you in court.

311
00:24:46,589 --> 00:24:48,190
Come on, michael.

312
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,329
Say bye to your dad.

313
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:53,789
Get over here. hey, kiddo.

314
00:24:55,099 --> 00:24:58,400
I'll see you next week, all right? we'll do something.

315
00:24:59,339 --> 00:25:01,869
Let's get you an ice cream.

316
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:30,099
You have 10 minutes remaining. ten minutes.

317
00:26:36,269 --> 00:26:39,299
Shake it, baby. shake it, shake it, shake it.

318
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:46,440
Oh, come on, girl. don't tell me $5 don't get me a little something.

319
00:26:46,549 --> 00:26:49,069
Can you dig that it costs money to be here?

320
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:50,819
Oh, come on, girl.

321
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,779
How much you want, frank?

322
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:29,509
Tell him I want 100 keys.

323
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:34,390
Frank, ain't nobody I know can get you that much personally, all right?

324
00:27:34,529 --> 00:27:36,359
You're gonna have to piece it together from several sources,

325
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,990
And it's not gonna be 100%% pure.

326
00:27:38,099 --> 00:27:39,900
I don't want that.

327
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,059
I know what you don't want, frank,

328
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,299
But look, what you're gonna need is to get

329
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:46,900
To the chiu-chou syndicate, all right?

330
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:49,480
Cholon, saigon. if they're gonna deal with you at all.

331
00:27:49,579 --> 00:27:51,880
I understand that, but by then it's gonna be too late.

332
00:27:52,009 --> 00:27:54,569
It'll be already chopped up. I wanna go get it where they go get it from.

333
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,740
I wanna go to the source.

334
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,910
So, you're gonna go get it yourself?

335
00:27:57,019 --> 00:27:59,009
Why not?

336
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:01,490
Huh? I came this far.

337
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,660
You're gonna go into the motherfucking jungle?

338
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:05,119
I'm in the jungle. look around.

339
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:07,019
They're eating these roaches and whatever that is.

340
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:08,819
Nigga, I'm talking about snakes, all right?

341
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:10,690
I'm talking about tigers, I'm talking about vietcong,

342
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:14,500
I'm talking about mosquitoes that'll fucking kill your ass.

343
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,799
You wanna go into the jungle?

344
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,529
We're going.

345
00:28:20,539 --> 00:28:21,839
Fuck it. let's go. we're going.

346
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,170
Why not? let's go.

347
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,750
Hey, frank.

348
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:11,420
This whole spot's locked down by the kuomintang,

349
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:15,589
General chiang kai-shek's defeated army.

350
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,359
How would you get it into the states?

351
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:58,470
You ain't got to worry about that.

352
00:29:58,569 --> 00:29:59,700
Who do you work for in there?

353
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:02,369
You ain't got to worry about that, either.

354
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:04,339
Who are you, really?

355
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:07,039
Frank lucas, says it right there in my passport.

356
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,880
I mean, who you represent?

357
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:10,009
Me.

358
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:15,950
You think you're going to take 100 kilos of heroin into the us,

359
00:30:16,059 --> 00:30:20,049
And you don't work for anyone? someone is going to allow that?

360
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:21,220
That's right.

361
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:31,000
After this first purchase,

362
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,410
If you are not killed by marseille importers,

363
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:37,140
Or their people in the states,

364
00:30:37,609 --> 00:30:39,579
Then what?

365
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:43,210
Then there will be more, much more, I guarantee it.

366
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:48,549
And if it's all the same to you, I don't wanna have to drag my ass up here no more.

367
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:50,250
Of course not.

368
00:30:53,029 --> 00:30:54,190
My man.

369
00:30:55,099 --> 00:30:57,000
Soul brother, huh? soul brother.

370
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:44,039
Fifty grand. it's gonna cover them and the pilot and the boys on the other end.

371
00:31:44,779 --> 00:31:46,250
Give them a hundred.

372
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:49,079
Fifty is gonna cover it, frank.

373
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:51,880
Give them a hundred, give them the whole thing. here.

374
00:31:52,019 --> 00:31:53,279
And look,

375
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:58,559
That's all I got. so, if that dope don't arrive for any reason...

376
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:05,920
Hey, listen, cousin or no cousin, I'm a busy man, all right?

377
00:32:06,029 --> 00:32:09,259
I ain't got no time to be going to nobody's funeral.

378
00:32:09,769 --> 00:32:11,900
I'll let you know when it's in the air.

379
00:32:12,509 --> 00:32:13,559
My man.

380
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:29,019
Fuck.

381
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,589
Richie? yeah.

382
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:39,829
This fucking guy made me.

383
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:41,799
I don't know how he did, but he did.

384
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,769
He went for his gun.

385
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,599
I had to do it, man.

386
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:47,609
There's 100 people out there that heard the shots.

387
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:49,839
You gotta help me. you gotta do something.

388
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:51,670
Baby.

389
00:32:51,809 --> 00:32:52,839
Where are you, jay?

390
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:55,880
That's the problem.

391
00:32:59,019 --> 00:33:02,650
Dispatch, I got a 10-13. I got a 10-13.

392
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:04,730
Copy that. what's your 20?

393
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,490
Tower two.

394
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,819
Apartment 1g.

395
00:33:10,529 --> 00:33:12,329
Kent and west in the projects.

396
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:13,829
Identify yourself, please.

397
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:15,230
Detective richie roberts.

398
00:33:15,369 --> 00:33:18,299
That's a negative. I got no units in that area.

399
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:19,740
Bullshit.

400
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:22,529
Please put the call out again. I'm gonna need assistance.

401
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,740
Detective roberts, I got no units in that area.

402
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,680
That's a negative.

403
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:38,859
I didn't mention no cops. know what I'm saying?

404
00:33:39,029 --> 00:33:40,190
You know what I'm saying?

405
00:33:40,289 --> 00:33:42,420
Man 1: I'll get the motherfucker! kick his ass!

406
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:45,190
Man 2: yo, cracker, you gonna pay for this shit!

407
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:51,829
Man 3: where the fuck you going? where the fuck you going?

408
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,769
What you gonna do, motherfucker?

409
00:33:55,910 --> 00:34:00,009
Hey, hey, be cool. be cool, all right?

410
00:34:00,109 --> 00:34:02,450
I'll find out what's going on in here.

411
00:34:11,289 --> 00:34:12,619
Richie.

412
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:19,190
Open the door!

413
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,929
Open the motherfucking door!

414
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:22,260
Where's your backup?

415
00:34:22,369 --> 00:34:23,739
You motherfucking cracker!

416
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:26,309
You got no backup? why is that?

417
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,139
You gotta come out sometime, motherfucker!

418
00:34:29,809 --> 00:34:31,000
Bandage his neck.

419
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,239
Richie, he's dead.

420
00:34:32,349 --> 00:34:33,809
I know he's fucking dead, right.

421
00:34:33,909 --> 00:34:35,679
Bandage his neck, clean up his head,

422
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:38,150
Prop him up on the gurney so he's sitting and open his fucking eyes.

423
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:39,309
Open this fucking door!

424
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:40,719
All right? let's go.

425
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:42,250
Fuck.

426
00:34:45,329 --> 00:34:47,420
All right, clean him up.

427
00:34:47,829 --> 00:34:50,230
Paramedic 2: okay. where's the solution?

428
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:53,260
Hey. huh?

429
00:34:55,039 --> 00:34:57,829
God damn it, open this fucking door!

430
00:34:58,510 --> 00:34:59,599
Give me your gun. what?

431
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:01,000
Give me your gun.

432
00:35:01,139 --> 00:35:03,909
Get your punk ass out here, man!

433
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:06,480
You have your badge? yeah.

434
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:08,079
I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch!

435
00:35:08,179 --> 00:35:09,619
You guys ready? uh-huh.

436
00:35:09,719 --> 00:35:11,809
Okay. just keep moving forward.

437
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:14,519
You all right? yeah.

438
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:17,590
It's okay! it's okay!

439
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:19,690
We're taking him to the hospital.

440
00:35:19,829 --> 00:35:22,659
Everybody, step back! step back!

441
00:35:23,829 --> 00:35:25,130
He's all right.

442
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:26,860
He's okay. we're taking care of him.

443
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,769
Step back. step back.

444
00:35:30,909 --> 00:35:33,530
Everything's fine. just stand back.

445
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:35,199
He's all right.

446
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:36,639
He's alive.

447
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:38,909
What happened inside?

448
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:40,780
We're taking him to the hospital.

449
00:35:50,059 --> 00:35:51,349
Thanks, man.

450
00:35:52,389 --> 00:35:53,719
Fuck.

451
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:57,159
That asshole pulled a piece on me, man. can you fucking believe it?

452
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:58,730
He pulls a piece on a cop?

453
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:01,420
I had to do it, man. kill or be killed.

454
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:04,530
Fucking crazy world, right?

455
00:36:07,369 --> 00:36:09,000
What the fuck were you doing in the projects?

456
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:12,269
Investigating stuff, man, you know,

457
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:16,010
Just like you taught me. checking on guys,

458
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:19,570
Following things up, putting the pieces together.

459
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:23,349
That guy was a dealer. a fucking dealer. scum of the earth.

460
00:36:24,429 --> 00:36:27,260
That guy didn't pull a gun on a cop, jay.

461
00:36:27,389 --> 00:36:29,920
That guy pulled a gun on a junkie,

462
00:36:30,059 --> 00:36:31,460
A junkie who was trying to rob him.

463
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:34,030
What the fuck you say?

464
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,699
What the fuck, man? what are you doing, man?

465
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,789
What the fuck is that?

466
00:36:37,909 --> 00:36:39,300
That's my fucking money, man!

467
00:36:39,409 --> 00:36:41,030
I earned this shit. that's mine!

468
00:36:41,139 --> 00:36:42,800
I earned it doing good cop work! what the fuck is this?

469
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,639
Good cop work!

470
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:46,340
You murdered a guy! I earned it getting shot at!

471
00:36:46,449 --> 00:36:48,280
You murdered a guy!

472
00:36:48,849 --> 00:36:50,579
You murdered him, you robbed his money,

473
00:36:50,679 --> 00:36:52,150
Then you called me to get you out of it.

474
00:36:52,289 --> 00:36:54,150
That makes me an accessory after the fact, motherfucker.

475
00:36:54,289 --> 00:36:58,250
I'll tell you the facts, man. just write the report the way I say it happened,

476
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:02,420
And then that's the way it is, and that's how it will be.

477
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,960
I can't do that.

478
00:37:05,869 --> 00:37:09,730
I'm a leper because I listened to you and turned in a million bucks.

479
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,599
No one will work with me after that.

480
00:37:12,809 --> 00:37:16,940
I can get off this shit, richie. that's easy.

481
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:19,150
Just write the report

482
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:21,869
Between us, as partners.

483
00:37:23,579 --> 00:37:25,110
I can't do that.

484
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:28,280
Hey!

485
00:37:29,889 --> 00:37:31,980
Stop! stop!

486
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:33,659
Fuck it.

487
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:13,469
Open the trunk.

488
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:31,679
Peace now! peace now! peace now!

489
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:38,920
Get out, get out, get out of vietnam!

490
00:38:39,059 --> 00:38:41,929
Get out, get out, get out of vietnam!

491
00:38:42,059 --> 00:38:45,289
As loud as we can that the vietnam war should stop,

492
00:38:45,429 --> 00:38:48,630
And that the best way to stop it is for the united states

493
00:38:48,769 --> 00:38:51,469
To simply pack up and get out of vietnam right now.

494
00:38:57,409 --> 00:38:58,900
How we looking?

495
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,539
Typically, what I see is 25%% to 45%% pure.

496
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:08,820
I mean, there's no adulterants, no alkaloids, no dilutants.

497
00:39:09,659 --> 00:39:11,820
It's 100%% .

498
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:17,389
May I?

499
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:18,800
Take it with you.

500
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,090
Thank you, frank.

501
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:22,079
I'll take it. no contingencies, no loans, no nothing.

502
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:24,250
Cash.

503
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:26,690
Fabulous.

504
00:41:31,329 --> 00:41:35,530
I'm not talking about your proclivities, richie. those I only know too well.

505
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,900
I'm talking about being a cop.

506
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:40,530
You're talking about taking money?

507
00:41:40,639 --> 00:41:41,869
I don't do that. it's not my thing.

508
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:43,469
What about your friends from the neighborhood?

509
00:41:43,579 --> 00:41:45,739
Do you still hang out with them? yeah.

510
00:41:45,849 --> 00:41:47,110
Play baseball on the weekends.

511
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:49,650
Wise guys? that's gonna look good.

512
00:41:50,119 --> 00:41:52,449
Guys I went to high school with. so what?

513
00:41:52,619 --> 00:41:54,590
What about joseph sodano?

514
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:56,949
What about him?

515
00:41:57,090 --> 00:41:59,789
Richie, I'm just trying to understand things your wife has said.

516
00:41:59,889 --> 00:42:01,219
If they're not true, tell me.

517
00:42:01,329 --> 00:42:02,889
Yeah, he's one of them.

518
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:05,289
Is he also your son's godfather? yeah.

519
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:07,329
He's definitely fucking her.

520
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:12,130
Do you really care about this? or do you just not want her to win ever?

521
00:42:16,039 --> 00:42:19,309
You know, there's an interview room on the second floor.

522
00:42:19,449 --> 00:42:21,610
That's what I thought. the door only locks from the inside.

523
00:42:21,719 --> 00:42:23,150
All rise.

524
00:42:29,559 --> 00:42:33,579
Oh, god, richie. richie, fuck me like a cop, not a lawyer!

525
00:42:43,039 --> 00:42:44,659
Don't answer it!

526
00:42:50,579 --> 00:42:51,639
Yeah?

527
00:43:05,730 --> 00:43:07,719
Richie roberts. hey, norm?

528
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:11,489
Hey. richie roberts.

529
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:12,659
Hi. detective norman reily.

530
00:43:12,769 --> 00:43:15,130
Hey, norm. how are you? good.

531
00:43:15,239 --> 00:43:17,400
So, is that him? yeah.

532
00:43:25,449 --> 00:43:29,179
Picked a nice night to come out, huh? it's like grand central around here.

533
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,880
It's been like this.

534
00:43:31,019 --> 00:43:35,349
I'm lucky if I get home by midnight. it's like nothing we've seen before.

535
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:42,159
Something I gotta sign?

536
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:44,159
Yeah. it's right here.

537
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:46,730
I'm taking this with me. I'll register it with essex county, all right?

538
00:43:46,869 --> 00:43:48,429
All right.

539
00:43:50,539 --> 00:43:56,170
America's public enemy number one in the united states is drug abuse.

540
00:43:57,579 --> 00:43:59,510
In order to fight and defeat this enemy,

541
00:43:59,610 --> 00:44:04,409
It is necessary to wage a new, all-out offensive.

542
00:44:04,789 --> 00:44:07,449
Federal authorities have announced their intention

543
00:44:07,590 --> 00:44:10,059
To establish special narcotics bureaus

544
00:44:10,159 --> 00:44:12,920
In washington, new york, los angeles, chicago...

545
00:44:13,059 --> 00:44:15,760
A detective without the support of his fellow detectives

546
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:17,849
Really can't do much.

547
00:44:19,469 --> 00:44:21,199
You know why I don't have it.

548
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:24,699
Doesn't matter. you did what you had to do.

549
00:44:25,409 --> 00:44:28,929
Greatest city in the world! and it's turning into an open sewer.

550
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:32,739
Everybody's stealing, dealing.

551
00:44:34,179 --> 00:44:37,550
Look at you. you can't work because you did your job.

552
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:41,050
Good news is, you're not the only honest cop in town.

553
00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:45,719
The special narcotics bureau in washington is not a dog and pony show.

554
00:44:45,989 --> 00:44:49,389
They are sincere. I know this because they want us to orchestrate it.

555
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:51,989
And I want you to head up things here on our end.

556
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:54,070
If it's federal, who do I answer to, the post office?

557
00:44:54,199 --> 00:44:55,460
No, you answer to me,

558
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:58,000
Me and the us attorney, nobody else.

559
00:44:59,969 --> 00:45:02,170
You never step foot in a police station again.

560
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:05,269
You work out of your own place, you pick your own guys,

561
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:07,510
Guys that you know would not take a nickel off the sidewalk.

562
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:35,760
Well, we got the lovely transit.

563
00:45:37,829 --> 00:45:40,760
600-year-old mahogany doors.

564
00:45:43,429 --> 00:45:46,630
Now, look at that. can't you just feel it?

565
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:49,400
I think it's lovely.

566
00:45:49,510 --> 00:45:51,599
Watch your step.

567
00:45:55,849 --> 00:45:58,210
Look at these beautiful floors.

568
00:45:58,309 --> 00:46:00,309
At least, I don't know, 200 years old.

569
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:02,349
And it's hard to get the cracks...

570
00:46:02,449 --> 00:46:04,280
Now this was one of my favorite rooms

571
00:46:04,389 --> 00:46:06,449
But we had some problems with the plumbing.

572
00:46:06,559 --> 00:46:07,989
I even fixed it. I know it works.

573
00:46:08,090 --> 00:46:09,489
It's not gonna leak.

574
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:15,659
Here it is.

575
00:46:22,369 --> 00:46:23,570
You know, I used to be a really good

576
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:24,800
Piano player when I was a kid,

577
00:46:24,909 --> 00:46:27,739
But then, I don't know why I forgot.

578
00:46:28,510 --> 00:46:30,309
Life goes on. well...

579
00:46:33,050 --> 00:46:35,780
How long are you gonna be?

580
00:46:37,719 --> 00:46:38,809
Oh, and do me a favor, please.

581
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:39,980
Mind the doors.

582
00:46:40,090 --> 00:46:43,820
Those are beautiful, ornate glass doors, you know.

583
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,559
Here we go, jimmy. come on.

584
00:46:52,670 --> 00:46:54,730
Oh, yeah. give it back.

585
00:47:00,389 --> 00:47:01,360
Huey's.

586
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:02,690
Huey. what up, boy?

587
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:03,920
Yeah, who this?

588
00:47:04,059 --> 00:47:05,550
Who you think it is, boy?

589
00:47:05,670 --> 00:47:07,360
Frank. frank who?

590
00:47:07,769 --> 00:47:10,360
Frank your brother, negro. frankie?

591
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:14,230
That's right.

592
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:16,309
Hey, melvin! melvin, where's ma?

593
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:18,880
What? frank's on the phone!

594
00:47:19,150 --> 00:47:20,610
Hey, ma! how are you doing, frankie?

595
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:22,710
Frank's on the phone!

596
00:47:23,179 --> 00:47:25,210
Say what? mama, frank's on the phone!

597
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:27,050
Frank? oh, my lord!

598
00:47:27,150 --> 00:47:29,309
Yeah, when? well, you just say it, man, yeah.

599
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:30,789
Listen, I'm gonna call y'all back

600
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:34,320
At 6:00. I want you to get everybody together, all right? get mama, get everybody.

601
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:36,159
All right? okay.

602
00:47:52,110 --> 00:47:53,369
Hey, frank!

603
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:54,739
What's happening, frank?

604
00:47:54,849 --> 00:47:57,409
Hey, frankie. how you doing, uncle frank?

605
00:47:57,519 --> 00:47:59,849
Get out the car. get the kids, get the kids.

606
00:48:01,349 --> 00:48:02,840
Look at this, baby.

607
00:48:02,989 --> 00:48:06,980
Oh, my lord! I'm so glad to see you, boy.

608
00:48:07,289 --> 00:48:11,750
Oh, I'm telling you, this is some piece of land you got here!

609
00:48:13,070 --> 00:48:14,460
I wonder what the poor people are doing here?

610
00:48:14,570 --> 00:48:15,929
And whose house is that, frankie?

611
00:48:16,039 --> 00:48:18,199
That is your house, mama.

612
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,969
Mine? that's yours.

613
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:23,500
And who else?

614
00:48:24,809 --> 00:48:28,940
Now, there, that's my room right there, man. right over there.

615
00:48:35,219 --> 00:48:37,489
Anybody want some more collard greens?

616
00:48:39,230 --> 00:48:43,630
I wanna tell you how happy I am to see all my children at the table

617
00:48:43,730 --> 00:48:46,199
And the grandchildren at the same time.

618
00:48:46,329 --> 00:48:48,059
My heart's so happy. enjoy yourselves.

619
00:48:48,170 --> 00:48:49,659
Right on, grandma.

620
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,739
I hope you got a job, boy, the way you're eating over here.

621
00:48:52,869 --> 00:48:56,710
That boy right there, he got a arm on him. I mean, a major league arm.

622
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:57,809
Oh, yeah?

623
00:48:57,909 --> 00:48:59,340
Ain't that right?

624
00:48:59,449 --> 00:49:00,570
Right on, pop.

625
00:49:00,679 --> 00:49:03,210
Well, we'll see after dinner. we'll see him throw it around a little bit.

626
00:49:03,349 --> 00:49:05,010
No, no, you can't catch him, man.

627
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:06,480
I'm talking about... I'm talking about...

628
00:49:06,590 --> 00:49:08,250
This guy throw harder than gibson.

629
00:49:08,389 --> 00:49:10,650
We're talking 95 miles an hour.

630
00:49:11,059 --> 00:49:13,030
Can you catch him? he gonna...

631
00:49:13,130 --> 00:49:14,650
He gonna catch the ground.

632
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:17,420
We might've played catch, I think, when I was about five years old.

633
00:49:17,559 --> 00:49:19,900
Since then, he ain't been able to keep up.

634
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:25,400
This is your room. it's perfect.

635
00:49:26,409 --> 00:49:28,340
Oh. why, it's...

636
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:30,699
Will you look at this?

637
00:49:30,909 --> 00:49:32,380
Oh!

638
00:49:33,110 --> 00:49:36,280
Oh, it's beautiful. it's beautiful. it's just...

639
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:37,869
I...

640
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:45,949
How did you...

641
00:49:46,059 --> 00:49:47,289
I had it made.

642
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:50,590
From memory.

643
00:49:50,730 --> 00:49:52,889
You were five when they took it away on me. that's right.

644
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,159
How could you remember it?

645
00:49:54,269 --> 00:49:55,860
How could I forget, mama?

646
00:50:00,570 --> 00:50:04,099
I'll just tell you it is perfect.

647
00:50:04,679 --> 00:50:06,869
It's all perfect.

648
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:14,579
I can't tell you how much I love you.

649
00:50:14,690 --> 00:50:16,420
I love you, too, mama.

650
00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:18,320
It's okay.

651
00:50:27,130 --> 00:50:29,159
Both these guys, good with wires,

652
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:30,889
They got solid informants,

653
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,489
And they're honest and they're fearless.

654
00:50:34,039 --> 00:50:36,570
They're insane, richie, like you.

655
00:50:37,110 --> 00:50:38,599
Where are they?

656
00:50:40,809 --> 00:50:44,340
That's jones with the skinny white broad.

657
00:50:44,449 --> 00:50:46,110
Best I ever seen on the street.

658
00:50:46,219 --> 00:50:49,750
He knows dope, but he's together, all right?

659
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:52,260
He's a stand-up guy all round.

660
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:55,849
And that's abruzzo with the two fat black ones.

661
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:59,420
He loves a big ass, man.

662
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:04,130
He's a bulldog. he don't fuck around, all right. he's got a bit of a temper,

663
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:07,639
Yeah, but you can trust this guy with your grandmother.

664
00:51:07,969 --> 00:51:10,030
Listen, richie. we work together.

665
00:51:10,139 --> 00:51:12,630
You want me, you gotta take them, too.

666
00:51:24,789 --> 00:51:25,880
When do we start?

667
00:51:29,059 --> 00:51:32,030
The man I worked for, he had one of the biggest companies in new york city.

668
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:34,789
He ran it for more than 50 years.

669
00:51:35,070 --> 00:51:38,800
Fifteen years, eight months and nine days,

670
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:40,500
I was with him every day. I worked for him,

671
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:44,369
I protected him, I looked after him, I learned from him.

672
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:47,510
Bumpy was rich, but he wasn't white man rich, you see?

673
00:51:47,610 --> 00:51:49,079
He wasn't wealthy.

674
00:51:49,179 --> 00:51:51,510
He didn't own his own company. he thought he did, but he didn't,

675
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:53,210
He just managed it.

676
00:51:53,349 --> 00:51:55,719
The white man owned it, so they owned him.

677
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:57,219
Nobody owns me, though. hey.

678
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:59,289
How you doing, babe? good.

679
00:51:59,389 --> 00:52:02,019
That's 'cause I own my own company, and my company sells a product

680
00:52:02,159 --> 00:52:04,789
That's better than the competition,

681
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:08,389
At a price that's lower than the competition.

682
00:52:09,170 --> 00:52:10,969
Well, what are we selling here, frank?

683
00:52:26,389 --> 00:52:28,409
How you doing, red?

684
00:52:28,550 --> 00:52:30,320
These are my brothers, just got here from north carolina.

685
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:31,480
Everybody, this is redtop.

686
00:52:31,590 --> 00:52:32,989
Hello. how you doing?

687
00:52:33,090 --> 00:52:35,530
And the ladies. hey.

688
00:52:35,630 --> 00:52:38,829
What wrong? y'all niggas ain't never seen hoochie before?

689
00:52:39,099 --> 00:52:40,219
Why are they all naked?

690
00:52:40,369 --> 00:52:42,099
So they can't steal nothing.

691
00:52:42,639 --> 00:52:43,659
Oh, right.

692
00:52:44,639 --> 00:52:49,340
The most important thing in business is honesty, integrity, hard work,

693
00:52:50,409 --> 00:52:51,739
Family,

694
00:52:52,579 --> 00:52:54,670
Never forgetting where we came from.

695
00:52:54,909 --> 00:52:56,440
Thank you, charlene.

696
00:53:01,550 --> 00:53:04,280
See, you are what you are in this world,

697
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:07,090
That's either one of two things.

698
00:53:08,289 --> 00:53:10,349
Either you're somebody,

699
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:13,559
Or you're nobody. be right back.

700
00:53:29,650 --> 00:53:31,949
I need these fresh. cause if I have to come back here and get you,

701
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:33,070
You know what it is. tango.

702
00:53:33,190 --> 00:53:34,710
Don't y'all play that. vendor 1: yes, sir, I hear you.

703
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:36,789
You won't have to come back. there won't be no problem.

704
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:38,449
Vendor 2: what about you, frank? you need anything?

705
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:40,650
Where's my money? redtop gave you the package.

706
00:53:40,789 --> 00:53:42,320
You're supposed to be handing me my money.

707
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:44,159
Here's a jar right here. twenty percent.

708
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:46,889
Oh, you got the jar? that's right.

709
00:53:47,869 --> 00:53:49,300
Get the fuck out of here... oh! what you gonna do?

710
00:53:50,670 --> 00:53:53,159
What the fuck you gonna do, frank? huh? what you doing?

711
00:53:53,309 --> 00:53:57,610
You gonna shoot me in front of everybody? huh? come on.

712
00:54:00,050 --> 00:54:01,309
Shit.

713
00:54:13,159 --> 00:54:15,989
There you go. twenty percent.

714
00:54:39,539 --> 00:54:41,369
So, what was I saying?

715
00:54:50,650 --> 00:54:51,610
Jones.

716
00:54:53,519 --> 00:54:55,210
Jonesy.

717
00:54:57,190 --> 00:54:58,619
That was nice, man.

718
00:55:00,059 --> 00:55:01,579
Just doing my melodious thing, baby.

719
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:03,280
Got you.

720
00:55:10,119 --> 00:55:13,449
This is the newly formed essex county narcotics squad.

721
00:55:14,849 --> 00:55:18,420
Our mandate is to make major arrests. no street guys.

722
00:55:19,489 --> 00:55:22,590
We're looking for the suppliers and the distributors.

723
00:55:22,699 --> 00:55:25,820
Heroin, cocaine, amphetamines. no grass under 1,000 pounds.

724
00:55:25,969 --> 00:55:27,659
No powder under 40 kilograms.

725
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:29,730
Any less than that, then somebody else can waste their time.

726
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:33,570
We gonna be handling the big shipments, the big money and the big temptation.

727
00:55:33,670 --> 00:55:34,900
I heard a story about you.

728
00:55:35,010 --> 00:55:37,769
That you found a million dollars in unmarked cash

729
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:40,679
And gave that shit back. is that true?

730
00:55:41,349 --> 00:55:44,510
Yeah, I did. anybody got a problem with that?

731
00:55:48,489 --> 00:55:50,579
So do i, you know? I think about it every day.

732
00:55:50,690 --> 00:55:53,659
I should be down in south florida with a 68-foot cruiser doing fishing charters.

733
00:55:53,789 --> 00:55:54,820
You and me, both.

734
00:55:54,929 --> 00:55:58,119
But you know, I didn't, so here I am,

735
00:55:58,230 --> 00:56:00,630
And we'll be looking to land other kind of sharks.

736
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:30,320
All right? bingo.

737
00:56:53,519 --> 00:56:55,650
See that, richie? yeah.

738
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:58,690
And this stuff is your everyday stuff.

739
00:56:58,789 --> 00:57:01,659
But this blue magic, twice the potency.

740
00:57:01,789 --> 00:57:04,349
I mean, it's the purest thing

741
00:57:04,349 --> 00:57:06,460
I ever seen in the streets. it's strong enough to smoke.

742
00:57:06,599 --> 00:57:09,530
And that's for those white suburban kids who are scared of needles.

743
00:57:09,639 --> 00:57:11,300
I paid 10 bucks for that.

744
00:57:11,570 --> 00:57:14,199
And it's everywhere. I mean, it's on every corner out there.

745
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:16,070
So, how is that possible?

746
00:57:16,179 --> 00:57:19,610
Who can afford to sell shit twice as good for half as much?

747
00:57:27,750 --> 00:57:30,119
Hey, man. frankie, baby, good to see you!

748
00:57:30,219 --> 00:57:31,150
Everything's good?

749
00:57:31,289 --> 00:57:32,420
Yeah, man, just got back from europe,

750
00:57:32,519 --> 00:57:35,050
Over there for two months, south of france, man.

751
00:57:37,829 --> 00:57:41,630
Photographer 1: look right, look right. wonderful, wonderful.

752
00:57:43,699 --> 00:57:45,170
Photographer 2: nicky!

753
00:57:46,639 --> 00:57:47,829
Photographer 3: give us a smile, nicky.

754
00:57:47,969 --> 00:57:49,170
Photographer 4: show us the cover.

755
00:57:49,309 --> 00:57:50,469
You know what I'm saying, man?

756
00:57:50,579 --> 00:57:51,840
Photographer 5: hey, nicky, over here.

757
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:53,309
There you go.

758
00:57:55,679 --> 00:57:57,010
Nicky!

759
00:57:58,679 --> 00:58:01,480
Who is that? look at you, my man.

760
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,019
All right.

761
00:58:11,159 --> 00:58:12,650
Ladies and gentlemen,

762
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:15,460
The brown bomber! the champ!

763
00:58:15,570 --> 00:58:17,190
Mr. joe louis!

764
00:58:26,309 --> 00:58:27,869
Who's that with joe?

765
00:58:28,210 --> 00:58:30,110
Miss puerto rico.

766
00:58:30,219 --> 00:58:31,840
Puerto rico? mmm-hmm.

767
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:33,110
Is she a beauty queen?

768
00:58:33,219 --> 00:58:35,309
For real. the beauty queen.

769
00:58:59,579 --> 00:59:02,409
Welcome. my main man. my main man.

770
00:59:07,690 --> 00:59:09,150
Can you all excuse us for a minute, please?

771
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:10,309
Yeah, sure, frank.

772
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:12,119
Yes, sir.

773
00:59:13,190 --> 00:59:14,630
Thank you.

774
00:59:18,429 --> 00:59:19,829
What's going on?

775
00:59:19,929 --> 00:59:21,630
What you smiling about? I don't know.

776
00:59:21,730 --> 00:59:24,360
What is this? huh? what's what?

777
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:26,559
What's what? come here.

778
00:59:28,170 --> 00:59:29,469
What is that you got on?

779
00:59:29,579 --> 00:59:31,130
What's what, man?

780
00:59:31,239 --> 00:59:33,179
Yeah, that! what you got on.

781
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:34,539
This is a very, very, very nice suit.

782
00:59:34,679 --> 00:59:37,980
That's a very, very, very nice suit, huh? that's a clown suit. that's a costume...

783
00:59:38,079 --> 00:59:40,920
That says "arrest me."

784
00:59:41,050 --> 00:59:42,179
You understand? you're too loud.

785
00:59:42,289 --> 00:59:44,150
You're making too much noise. look at me.

786
00:59:44,260 --> 00:59:48,750
The loudest one in the room is the weakest one in the room. I told you that.

787
00:59:48,889 --> 00:59:51,420
All right? what, are you trying to be like nicky barnes, now?

788
00:59:51,559 --> 00:59:53,030
What's your problem with nicky, man? I like nicky.

789
00:59:53,130 --> 00:59:54,690
I ain't got no problem with nicky. oh, you like nicky?

790
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,059
Yeah! you want to be like nicky?

791
00:59:56,199 --> 00:59:58,860
You want to be superfly? you wanna work for him?

792
00:59:58,969 --> 01:00:00,769
Share a jail cell with him? maybe cook for him?

793
01:00:00,909 --> 01:00:01,900
He wants to talk to you.

794
01:00:02,039 --> 01:00:04,909
Oh, so now you talking to him about me? what? you...

795
01:00:05,039 --> 01:00:06,570
About what? what is it about? it ain't like that.

796
01:00:06,679 --> 01:00:07,940
Then what is it like? we were talking,

797
01:00:08,050 --> 01:00:09,949
Your name came up. about what?

798
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:13,110
I don't know, man. I told him I'd tell you.

799
01:00:14,789 --> 01:00:16,280
You know... boy, you...

800
01:00:18,119 --> 01:00:20,789
You know, if you wasn't my brother, I'd kill you. you know that, don't you?

801
01:00:20,929 --> 01:00:22,619
I'd blow your motherfucking brains out.

802
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:23,750
Come on, man. don't be like that.

803
01:00:23,860 --> 01:00:25,159
I'm taking you shopping this week.

804
01:00:25,260 --> 01:00:27,099
I went shopping. I can tell.

805
01:00:27,230 --> 01:00:29,889
See deep into you

806
01:00:30,469 --> 01:00:34,909
And know what you're thinking now

807
01:00:36,139 --> 01:00:37,670
And if I'm what you're needing

808
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:43,860
I need some kind of sign

809
01:00:44,369 --> 01:00:49,960
Let me know, cause I can't read your mind

810
01:00:50,739 --> 01:00:54,639
Are you in or am I in this on my own?

811
01:00:55,010 --> 01:00:57,139
I need some clue from you

812
01:00:57,949 --> 01:00:59,610
It's a tax thing.

813
01:00:59,949 --> 01:01:01,639
It's a mistake my lawyers are straightening out,

814
01:01:01,750 --> 01:01:03,309
But for the time being...

815
01:01:03,489 --> 01:01:05,079
How much do you owe, joe?

816
01:01:06,349 --> 01:01:08,980
It's nothing. it's like...

817
01:01:09,190 --> 01:01:10,320
Fifty grand.

818
01:01:12,159 --> 01:01:13,820
You got it.

819
01:01:14,860 --> 01:01:16,190
Thank you, man.

820
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:17,730
Hey, I'm gonna pay you back as soon as i...

821
01:01:17,829 --> 01:01:21,230
Joe, this ain't no loan. it's a gift. all right?

822
01:01:21,340 --> 01:01:23,900
All you did for bumpy, we owe you.

823
01:01:24,469 --> 01:01:26,570
Keep your chin up. all right? okay?

824
01:01:26,679 --> 01:01:28,170
All you have which is down there. down.

825
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:29,710
Chin down.

826
01:01:30,250 --> 01:01:32,300
All right. doc, will see you, okay?

827
01:01:39,250 --> 01:01:40,949
You still owe me that dance, right?

828
01:01:41,059 --> 01:01:42,420
Doc, come on.

829
01:01:42,519 --> 01:01:44,920
Frank, check this.

830
01:01:55,639 --> 01:01:57,260
How you doing? hi.

831
01:01:57,369 --> 01:01:58,360

832
01:01:58,469 --> 01:01:59,460
Eva kendo.

833
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:01,369
Nice to meet you, eva.

834
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:03,409
Nice to meet you, frank.

835
01:02:04,449 --> 01:02:06,440
You're frank and this is your place?

836
01:02:06,550 --> 01:02:09,570
That's right. I'm frank and this is my place.

837
01:02:10,519 --> 01:02:12,250
Why is it called small's?

838
01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:14,179
Why don't you call it frank's?

839
01:02:15,659 --> 01:02:19,179
When you own something, you can call it what you want.

840
01:02:19,329 --> 01:02:20,590
Small's.

841
01:02:20,699 --> 01:02:23,489
Or frank's. frankie small's.

842
01:02:24,070 --> 01:02:25,619
Small's frankie.

843
01:02:27,139 --> 01:02:28,570
That's right.

844
01:02:29,070 --> 01:02:31,130
You want to let my hand go?

845
01:02:32,639 --> 01:02:33,800
Okay.

846
01:02:35,210 --> 01:02:36,269
You leaving?

847
01:02:36,380 --> 01:02:37,780
No, I was going to my table.

848
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:40,349
Okay. need somebody to go with you?

849
01:02:42,519 --> 01:02:43,679
Yes? mmm-hmm.

01:02:47,260 --> 01:02:48,280
All the cheesies.

851
01:02:48,389 --> 01:02:50,119
Right here, here we go. what have we got here?

852
01:02:50,230 --> 01:02:51,489
Wash your hands?

853
01:02:51,590 --> 01:02:52,789
I got one print of that, don't smudge it.

854
01:02:52,889 --> 01:02:54,659
Yeah. there you go.

855
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:58,039
Hey, spearman, what about him? who is that?

856
01:02:58,150 --> 01:03:00,239
Joey sodano. don cattano's nephew.

857
01:03:00,380 --> 01:03:01,869
Yeah, yeah. put him up there by the big man.

858
01:03:01,989 --> 01:03:03,389
He looks like your uncle, abruzzo.

859
01:03:03,489 --> 01:03:04,610
Yeah, but he's not as handsome.

860
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:06,920
He looks more like your sister. where's ice pick's mug?

861
01:03:07,059 --> 01:03:08,050
Yeah, that's funny.

862
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:09,389
Maybe you guys should take that show on the road.

863
01:03:09,489 --> 01:03:11,889
So we need ice pick paul.

864
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,360
Ice pick paul? yeah.

865
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:14,929
There you go. get him up.

866
01:03:15,070 --> 01:03:17,630
Ice pick paul, he goes way up there, up top.

867
01:03:17,769 --> 01:03:21,170
No, ice pick paul, he's a fucking soldier. this guy's a lieutenant.

868
01:03:21,269 --> 01:03:22,429
How's that even fucking possible?

869
01:03:22,539 --> 01:03:23,909
That's benny the bishop.

870
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:28,639
That guy is a soldier. this guy's a lieutenant. no way that guy's on top.

871
01:03:28,780 --> 01:03:30,539
You thinking of benny the bishop.

872
01:03:30,650 --> 01:03:33,550
Vinnie two socks is fucking cattano's deadbeat son-in-law.

873
01:03:33,650 --> 01:03:34,739
Jonesy's right.

874
01:03:34,849 --> 01:03:36,980
Hey, which one of you guys has ever actually seen ice pick paul selling drugs?

875
01:03:37,090 --> 01:03:38,449
Actually seen it go down?

876
01:03:41,239 --> 01:03:42,139
Yeah, seen it go down.

877
01:03:42,309 --> 01:03:43,900
Been in his place. seen him handle drugs.

878
01:03:44,010 --> 01:03:45,909
That rat, ricky, has told us...

879
01:03:46,010 --> 01:03:49,349
He's fucking dead. about four weeks ago.

880
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:51,639
He's dead.

881
01:03:51,750 --> 01:03:52,739
All right, well,

882
01:03:52,849 --> 01:03:54,010
We can take him off the fucking board.

883
01:03:54,119 --> 01:03:58,559
I don't think we got any solid evidence on anybody on that board.

884
01:03:59,190 --> 01:04:00,559
What you saying, richie?

885
01:04:00,730 --> 01:04:02,090
This is weeks and weeks of work, man.

886
01:04:02,199 --> 01:04:03,860
I'm saying, take it down.

887
01:04:04,030 --> 01:04:05,690
We got to start again from the street.

888
01:07:20,130 --> 01:07:21,650
Hi, who's this?

889
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:25,090
Hello? gabe? yeah, it's scott. yeah.

890
01:07:25,300 --> 01:07:27,730
Scotty! what's going down, brother?

891
01:07:27,829 --> 01:07:29,199
Those snow tires you gave me last night.

892
01:07:29,369 --> 01:07:30,730
They come in yet?

893
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:32,599
Oh, the snow tires?

894
01:07:32,769 --> 01:07:34,570
Yeah. I want some more of them.

895
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:35,900
Give me one-and-a-half

896
01:07:36,079 --> 01:07:37,130
One-and-a-half,

897
01:07:37,239 --> 01:07:38,840
That's a pretty big order.

898
01:07:39,010 --> 01:07:40,639
Yeah, I want the big whitewalls,

899
01:07:40,750 --> 01:07:43,110
They better get at least 100,000 miles.

900
01:07:43,219 --> 01:07:45,150
All right, I'll tell you what.

901
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:47,250
You come in here tomorrow morning

902
01:07:47,389 --> 01:07:48,909
I'm gonna set you up real nice

903
01:07:49,090 --> 01:07:50,650
With a whitewall special, all right?

904
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:51,719
Thanks, bro.

905
01:07:51,829 --> 01:07:52,849
No problem.

906
01:07:55,260 --> 01:07:58,860
That's considerably more than one year's salary, richie.

907
01:07:59,300 --> 01:08:01,030
If it disappears, I will not be able to get it for you again.

908
01:08:05,559 --> 01:08:06,579
That's yours.

909
01:08:06,820 --> 01:08:11,119
Signing my life away again, for a lousy twenty grand.

910
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:16,020
It has to be blue magic, right?

911
01:08:16,170 --> 01:08:18,130
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's gonna be blue.

912
01:08:18,229 --> 01:08:19,289
You can pick it up here tomorrow.

913
01:08:19,399 --> 01:08:20,489
$20,000.

914
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:22,500
Just leave it there.

915
01:08:36,390 --> 01:08:38,220
How'd you do? good.

916
01:08:40,260 --> 01:08:41,720
Here he comes.

917
01:08:41,859 --> 01:08:43,289
That's him? yep.

918
01:08:44,590 --> 01:08:46,189
That was quick.

919
01:08:57,840 --> 01:08:59,239
Richie, if he goes in the city, what do we fucking do?

920
01:08:59,380 --> 01:09:00,970
Stay with the fucking money, that's what we do.

921
01:09:01,079 --> 01:09:02,140
We stay with the money, all right?

922
01:09:02,250 --> 01:09:03,510
We can't go in the fucking city.

923
01:09:03,609 --> 01:09:05,409
Yes, we can. that's 20 grand in there, all right,

924
01:09:05,550 --> 01:09:07,479
That I'm responsible for. I ain't losing it.

925
01:09:07,579 --> 01:09:09,180
It's out of our jurisdiction!

926
01:09:09,289 --> 01:09:11,720
Follow the money! all right, all right, all right!

927
01:09:26,590 --> 01:09:27,850
He's pulling over.

928
01:09:27,949 --> 01:09:30,010
All right, here we go.

929
01:09:30,119 --> 01:09:31,949
Let me out here.

930
01:09:34,090 --> 01:09:35,920
Don't disappear, all right?

931
01:09:35,930 --> 01:09:37,659
I'll circle the block.

932
01:09:38,359 --> 01:09:39,960
Move!

933
01:09:56,720 --> 01:10:00,020
Hey! who's the fuck? you gotta fucking move!

934
01:10:11,630 --> 01:10:13,119
Police officer. I'm commandeering

935
01:10:13,229 --> 01:10:14,670
Your vehicle. get out of the car.

936
01:10:15,369 --> 01:10:17,359
Who the fuck cares about you? this is new york city, man.

937
01:10:17,470 --> 01:10:18,529
Get someone else's car!

938
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:19,630
Get out of the car.

939
01:10:19,739 --> 01:10:22,069
Come on, man. can't we live in peace...

940
01:12:30,149 --> 01:12:32,020
Frankie, frankie! sit down.

941
01:12:32,149 --> 01:12:33,520
Man 1: what?

942
01:12:34,319 --> 01:12:36,949
Happy birthday, gentlemen. how you doing, huh?

943
01:12:37,060 --> 01:12:40,619
He's about to do something, huh? he's going bowling?

944
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:43,020
Look at that. strike.

945
01:12:43,170 --> 01:12:44,359
Hey, what's between your legs? what's in the bag?

946
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:46,130
Nothing. get up, you fucker. get the fuck up!

947
01:12:46,229 --> 01:12:47,289
Man 2: knock it off.

948
01:12:47,399 --> 01:12:48,729
Man 3: shut the fuck up! what did I tell you?

949
01:12:48,869 --> 01:12:49,960
Man 4: keep your fucking head down.

950
01:12:50,069 --> 01:12:51,130
Man 3: shut up! whose bag is this?

951
01:12:51,239 --> 01:12:52,710
What're you doing? man 3: sit down and shut up!

952
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:54,000
Man 4: don't you move!

953
01:13:06,220 --> 01:13:08,659
Hey, guys? guys! officers!

954
01:13:09,689 --> 01:13:12,420
Hey, I'm richie roberts, from newark.

955
01:13:14,199 --> 01:13:15,890
That's my money.

956
01:13:16,529 --> 01:13:19,520
What the fuck? what money, huh? what money?

957
01:13:20,739 --> 01:13:22,329
The bills are sequenced, right?

958
01:13:22,439 --> 01:13:25,600
They're registered with the essex county prosecutor's office. just check them out.

959
01:13:25,739 --> 01:13:28,680
They all start with cf3500. have a look.

960
01:13:34,220 --> 01:13:35,340
Fucking registers.

961
01:13:35,449 --> 01:13:38,680
I thought I had a fucking chris-craft sitting in my driveway.

962
01:13:38,789 --> 01:13:41,720
Honest mistake. I'll just get the money.

963
01:13:43,260 --> 01:13:45,279
This time. all right.

964
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:48,229
There it is. all right. thank you.

965
01:13:48,329 --> 01:13:51,090
When was the last time I was in jersey? let me think.

966
01:13:53,270 --> 01:13:54,430
Never.

967
01:13:56,470 --> 01:13:58,529
What're you doing, coming over here unannounced?

968
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:00,069
You don't think you could get hurt doing that?

969
01:14:02,890 --> 01:14:05,159
You got your fucking money, richie.

970
01:14:06,199 --> 01:14:10,130
And never, ever come into this city again unannounced.

971
01:14:10,239 --> 01:14:12,600
You come in to see a fucking broadway show,

972
01:14:12,699 --> 01:14:15,829
You call ahead first, see if it's okay with me.

973
01:14:17,180 --> 01:14:19,140
No problem. all right.

974
01:14:23,619 --> 01:14:24,840
Let's go, hit some balls.

975
01:14:24,949 --> 01:14:26,140
Great suits, pal.

976
01:14:28,090 --> 01:14:29,680
Is that your car?

977
01:14:30,189 --> 01:14:32,210
That's a fucking great car.

978
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:34,850
Have a nice fucking trip back to jersey.

979
01:14:34,989 --> 01:14:36,119
All right.

980
01:14:36,229 --> 01:14:38,720
Come on, I got a tee time. let's go.

981
01:14:42,770 --> 01:14:44,460
What were you doin' there?

982
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:46,260
Well, that's where this dope is coming from.

983
01:14:46,439 --> 01:14:48,100
Blue magic, it's coming out of new york.

984
01:14:48,210 --> 01:14:49,800
What do you expect me to do, ignore it?

985
01:14:49,909 --> 01:14:53,170
The cab driver has filed aggravated assault and grand theft charges

986
01:14:53,279 --> 01:14:54,640
Which he may reconsider

987
01:14:54,750 --> 01:14:58,239
Depending on how much the state of new jersey offers to settle.

988
01:14:59,020 --> 01:15:01,819
I showed him my id. I told him I was a cop.

989
01:15:03,359 --> 01:15:05,619
You stole his cab and you knock him out.

990
01:15:05,789 --> 01:15:08,050
I was chasing the 20 grand, all right?

991
01:15:08,829 --> 01:15:11,920
Next time, knock him out before you show him your badge.

992
01:15:13,699 --> 01:15:17,460
Look, I don't want to hear about you going into new york again.

993
01:15:18,439 --> 01:15:19,770
Well, then this investigation's over.

994
01:15:19,939 --> 01:15:21,270
You're not listening to me.

995
01:15:21,369 --> 01:15:23,670
I said, "i don't want to hear about you going into new york again."

996
01:15:23,779 --> 01:15:25,039
You do whatever you have to do.

997
01:15:25,210 --> 01:15:26,470
You go wherever you have to go

998
01:15:26,579 --> 01:15:29,140
To figure out who's bringing this shit into the country.

999
01:15:29,250 --> 01:15:31,840
Just don't tell me about it.

1000
01:15:36,119 --> 01:15:37,520
There's your girl, right there.

1001
01:15:42,289 --> 01:15:44,189
Hey, how'd you do? hi.

1002
01:15:44,300 --> 01:15:46,350
I didn't keep you waiting long, did i? no. fine.

1003
01:15:46,460 --> 01:15:49,590
Good. a woman as beautiful as you shouldn't have to wait.

1004
01:15:50,670 --> 01:15:52,470
For anything.

1005
01:15:57,710 --> 01:16:00,510
Thank you, ma'am. you as pretty as ever.

1006
01:16:05,149 --> 01:16:06,170
Hey, doc.

1007
01:16:06,279 --> 01:16:07,250
Tommy!

1008
01:16:07,350 --> 01:16:09,619
Heard your boy scored two touchdowns last week.

1009
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:11,050
Sure. sure do make father proud.

1010
01:16:11,220 --> 01:16:12,590
All right.

1011
01:16:21,699 --> 01:16:23,460
This is your father?

1012
01:16:26,590 --> 01:16:28,420
That's martin luther king.

1013
01:16:29,420 --> 01:16:31,289
It is not. it is. it is martin luther king.

1014
01:16:31,430 --> 01:16:32,890
You know, "i have a dream"?

1015
01:16:32,989 --> 01:16:34,260
Of course.

1016
01:16:34,359 --> 01:16:36,159
No, that's...

1017
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:39,789
He was just as important as martin luther king to me.

1018
01:16:39,930 --> 01:16:41,800
What did he do?

1019
01:16:41,939 --> 01:16:44,930
A lot of things. he was a friend

1020
01:16:45,539 --> 01:16:48,300
And served new york. new york served him.

1021
01:16:49,010 --> 01:16:50,600
He was my boss.

1022
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:52,140
My teacher.

1023
01:16:52,279 --> 01:16:53,750
What did he teach you?

1024
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:56,180
He taught me a lot of things. he

1025
01:16:58,390 --> 01:17:00,819
Taught me how to take my time.

1026
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:05,949
Taught me that if I was going to do something, to do it with care, with love.

1027
01:17:06,859 --> 01:17:08,420
Anything else?

1028
01:17:12,869 --> 01:17:14,989
He taught me to be a gentleman.

1029
01:17:15,140 --> 01:17:16,189
That's what you are?

1030
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:18,500
That's what I try to be. come here.

1031
01:17:20,010 --> 01:17:21,869
Come here. sit right here.

1032
01:17:24,180 --> 01:17:25,340
Look at me.

1033
01:17:26,409 --> 01:17:29,470
I own about five apartments in manhattan.

1034
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:32,710
Homes all over the east coast,

1035
01:17:32,710 --> 01:17:34,909
I could have taken you to any one of them, but I didn't.

1036
01:17:35,020 --> 01:17:36,109
I brought you here. frank,

1037
01:17:36,220 --> 01:17:37,619
I was looking for you, boy.

1038
01:17:37,729 --> 01:17:39,750
Because I wanted you to meet my mother.

1039
01:17:39,859 --> 01:17:41,420
How you doing, ma?

1040
01:17:41,529 --> 01:17:42,659
Is this her?

1041
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:44,319
Eva, this is my mother. hi, eva.

1042
01:17:45,699 --> 01:17:47,060
Nice to meet you.

1043
01:17:47,170 --> 01:17:48,800
She's beautiful! yeah?

1044
01:17:48,899 --> 01:17:53,899
Look at her, frank. she's an angel come down from heaven.

1045
01:17:54,039 --> 01:17:55,630
Thank you.

1046
01:18:03,350 --> 01:18:07,479
Mr. roberts? I'm here for our appointment.

1047
01:18:11,029 --> 01:18:12,859
Morning. morning.

1048
01:18:15,029 --> 01:18:16,930
Sorry. our appointment?

1049
01:18:17,060 --> 01:18:19,229
Child social services.

1050
01:18:33,310 --> 01:18:36,220
She did mention your name, though.

1051
01:18:36,319 --> 01:18:37,479
The stewardess?

1052
01:18:37,590 --> 01:18:39,380
No, not the stewardess.

1053
01:18:40,149 --> 01:18:43,750
The lady from child services. she mentioned your name.

1054
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:47,880
Right after she asked me if I associated with any criminals.

1055
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:48,960
Boy 1: all right, go! go, go!

1056
01:18:49,060 --> 01:18:50,220
Boy 2: yeah! you wanna see this?

1057
01:18:50,329 --> 01:18:51,920
Hey, boys.

1058
01:18:52,069 --> 01:18:53,829
Joey. hey, joey!

1059
01:18:53,930 --> 01:18:55,630
Get in the pool. go on.

1060
01:18:56,840 --> 01:18:58,569
Come on. come on.

1061
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:04,569
So, how'd she get my name?

1062
01:19:04,979 --> 01:19:06,470
Laurie. hmm.

1063
01:19:07,449 --> 01:19:09,779
She's been saying a lot lately.

1064
01:19:10,619 --> 01:19:11,810
A lot.

1065
01:19:15,659 --> 01:19:18,220
You know, when you asked me to be your son's godfather,

1066
01:19:18,329 --> 01:19:19,489
I took it very seriously.

1067
01:19:19,630 --> 01:19:21,489
I know. I know and I appreciate that.

1068
01:19:21,630 --> 01:19:24,560
And I said yes, I would take on this responsibility.

1069
01:19:24,670 --> 01:19:27,229
Take care of your son, if god forbid, something happened to you.

1070
01:19:27,329 --> 01:19:30,239
Joe, the kind of things she's saying to child social services

1071
01:19:30,340 --> 01:19:33,000
Made me look really bad, all right. you know,

1072
01:19:33,140 --> 01:19:37,630
Out at all kinds of hours at night time, lowlife informants around, women.

1073
01:19:37,779 --> 01:19:39,640
Old friends like me.

1074
01:19:40,279 --> 01:19:42,579
Old friends like you, yeah.

1075
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:46,109
Uncle joey, watch me, okay?

1076
01:19:49,689 --> 01:19:51,279
Okay, I understand.

1077
01:19:51,390 --> 01:19:55,420
They ask me, I'll tell them what you want me to tell them. I'll lie for you.

1078
01:19:55,529 --> 01:19:57,689
No, don't lie. you don't have to lie.

1079
01:19:57,829 --> 01:20:00,960
Just, omit certain details.

1080
01:20:01,699 --> 01:20:03,359
Sure. all right.

1081
01:20:05,739 --> 01:20:07,760
You know, there's something else I was gonna ask you.

1082
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:08,840
Something else.

1083
01:20:08,939 --> 01:20:10,970
You don't have to answer if you don't want.

1084
01:20:13,210 --> 01:20:15,710
Blue magic. anything?

1085
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:22,319
Just a lot of sorrow, misery from guys getting put out of work, that's all.

1086
01:20:23,420 --> 01:20:24,619
What, your guys?

1087
01:20:24,729 --> 01:20:25,779
Just guys.

1088
01:20:27,489 --> 01:20:30,289
You thinking about where it's coming from?

1089
01:20:30,399 --> 01:20:33,060
Guys down south. that's all I heard.

1090
01:20:33,699 --> 01:20:35,359
Cubans? I don't know.

1091
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:37,829
Not mexico.

1092
01:20:38,539 --> 01:20:39,630
I don't know.

1093
01:20:40,109 --> 01:20:42,199
You're telling me, it's coming in from south America?

1094
01:20:42,340 --> 01:20:43,869
I don't know.

1095
01:20:44,750 --> 01:20:47,289
All I can tell you is whoever it is,

1096
01:20:47,289 --> 01:20:49,409
they're upsetting the natural order of things.

1097
01:20:49,750 --> 01:20:51,840
And that's all there is.

1098
01:21:07,869 --> 01:21:08,890
What's up?

1099
01:21:09,039 --> 01:21:10,869
My man, how we looking?

1100
01:22:38,649 --> 01:22:41,119
Frank, I want you to meet mike sobota.

1101
01:22:41,550 --> 01:22:42,850
How are you doing, mr. sobota? how are you?

1102
01:22:42,989 --> 01:22:43,979
What can I get you?

1103
01:22:44,119 --> 01:22:46,149
How about a left-hander? from what charlie tells me, your nephew.

1104
01:22:46,289 --> 01:22:49,520
Oh, this is the... yankees, yeah. hey, steve! yankees.

1105
01:22:49,659 --> 01:22:51,100
Steve! come here. excuse me one second.

1106
01:22:51,199 --> 01:22:53,060
This boy's good, okay? I want you to put him on the yankees.

1107
01:22:53,170 --> 01:22:54,220
Cause you good enough, ain't you?

1108
01:22:54,329 --> 01:22:56,460
I'm a lucas. good enough on a bad day, jack.

1109
01:22:56,569 --> 01:22:58,329
He's good enough on a bad day, so don't make it a bad day,

1110
01:22:58,470 --> 01:22:59,869
Make it a good day, you understand?

1111
01:22:59,970 --> 01:23:04,310
Nypd, excuse me, police department. back up, baby.

1112
01:23:07,550 --> 01:23:09,310
Taking your ass in, jimmy. uh-uh.

1113
01:23:09,420 --> 01:23:11,609
Taking your ass in. where are the handcuffs?

1114
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:13,710
I got a license for that, motherfucker.

1115
01:23:13,850 --> 01:23:16,979
You got a license for this? excuse me, all right?

1116
01:23:19,090 --> 01:23:21,119
Shit. all right! yeah!

1117
01:23:21,390 --> 01:23:23,020
Now, you know what? I gotta arrest you for that shit.

1118
01:23:23,159 --> 01:23:24,319
That shit's too good to be on the street.

1119
01:23:24,430 --> 01:23:28,199
Wait a minute, I got this for you. you ain't got to arrest nobody.

1120
01:23:28,329 --> 01:23:30,000
Are you bribing me now?

1121
01:23:30,100 --> 01:23:32,699
I'll tell you what, I'm arresting everybody!

1122
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:34,640
Now, all you're under arrest! you first!

1123
01:23:34,739 --> 01:23:36,300
That's my family. that's my...

1124
01:23:36,409 --> 01:23:37,470
Excuse me, excuse me.

1125
01:23:40,010 --> 01:23:41,670
Back it up, baby.

1126
01:23:41,779 --> 01:23:42,840
What was that?

1127
01:23:42,949 --> 01:23:44,640
Come on, guys. what's the matter with you, man?

1128
01:23:44,750 --> 01:23:46,310
I said, what the hell was that? what was what?

1129
01:23:46,420 --> 01:23:48,010
I said what the hell are you doing, man? be cool, man!

1130
01:23:48,119 --> 01:23:49,319
What's your fucking problem?

1131
01:23:49,420 --> 01:23:51,149
What the hell's wrong with you?

1132
01:23:51,260 --> 01:23:53,050
Goddamn!

1133
01:23:53,859 --> 01:23:56,350
He's all right. I just shot him in the leg, is all.

1134
01:23:56,460 --> 01:23:58,260
Damn, jimmy!

1135
01:23:59,130 --> 01:24:00,329
Get up.

1136
01:24:14,050 --> 01:24:16,880
All right, everybody, get out! get out!

1137
01:24:17,949 --> 01:24:19,439
Come on, frank, it was an accident.

1138
01:24:19,590 --> 01:24:21,250
It wasn't no goddamn accident. he feels terrible.

1139
01:24:21,390 --> 01:24:24,750
He don't feel shit, 'cause he's coked up all the motherfucking time!

1140
01:24:24,890 --> 01:24:26,880
He's your driver. get rid of him.

1141
01:24:26,989 --> 01:24:27,960
Come on, man, that's your cousin!

1142
01:24:28,060 --> 01:24:29,050
That ain't shit to me!

1143
01:24:29,159 --> 01:24:30,189
He don't mean nothing to me.

1144
01:24:30,300 --> 01:24:31,229
What's he gonna do, go back home?

1145
01:24:31,329 --> 01:24:32,850
I don't give a damn what he does!

1146
01:24:32,970 --> 01:24:35,020
Send his ass home! hey! hey! hey!

1147
01:24:35,130 --> 01:24:37,100
Hey! don't rub on that! you blot that!

1148
01:24:37,239 --> 01:24:38,600
You understand? that's alpaca!

1149
01:24:38,739 --> 01:24:42,199
That's $25,000 alpaca! you blot that shit!

1150
01:24:42,310 --> 01:24:44,539
You don't rub it! put the club soda on there.

1151
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:46,579
Simple simon-ass motherfuckers.

1152
01:24:46,680 --> 01:24:49,880
Listen, from now on, don't nobody talk to me directly! you understand?

1153
01:24:49,979 --> 01:24:53,609
You got business with me, you talk to huey! huey, you talk to me! you got it?

1154
01:24:53,750 --> 01:24:54,739
All right.

1155
01:24:54,850 --> 01:24:56,220
Damn it, never on the phone! you got it?

1156
01:24:56,319 --> 01:24:57,550
I got it. all right!

1157
01:24:57,659 --> 01:25:00,060
And take them goddamn sunglasses off.

1158
01:25:00,159 --> 01:25:01,720
Take the goddamn sunglasses off!

1159
01:25:01,829 --> 01:25:03,390
Damn it, man.

1160
01:25:05,630 --> 01:25:08,000
Simple simon-ass motherfuckers.

1161
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:25,949
The whole place was imported.

1162
01:25:26,520 --> 01:25:28,149
Brick by brick.

1163
01:25:29,289 --> 01:25:30,310
Gloucestershire.

1164
01:25:31,460 --> 01:25:33,619
Who? great britain.

1165
01:25:34,229 --> 01:25:35,590
Yours.

1166
01:25:40,569 --> 01:25:42,119
Here you go.

1167
01:25:46,539 --> 01:25:47,529
Pull!

1168
01:25:53,180 --> 01:25:54,840
Come, eva.

1169
01:25:55,720 --> 01:25:58,710
I'm sure you're dying to see the rest of the house.

1170
01:26:02,489 --> 01:26:04,979
Of course. excuse me.

1171
01:26:06,229 --> 01:26:09,159
Thank you for a wonderful lunch. it was delicious.

1172
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,130
What do you think of monopolies?

1173
01:26:16,539 --> 01:26:17,699
You mean like the game?

1174
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:21,470
No, I just think monopolies were made illegal in the country, frank,

1175
01:26:21,569 --> 01:26:23,800
Cause nobody wants to compete, you know.

1176
01:26:23,909 --> 01:26:26,899
Nobody wants to compete, not with a monopoly.

1177
01:26:27,050 --> 01:26:29,640
I mean, you let the dairy farmers do that,

1178
01:26:29,750 --> 01:26:31,739
Half of them would be out of business tomorrow.

1179
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:33,350
Just trying to make a living.

1180
01:26:33,449 --> 01:26:35,149
That's your right, I mean,

1181
01:26:35,350 --> 01:26:38,020
It's everyone's right. it's America.

1182
01:26:38,390 --> 01:26:42,560
We just can't do it at the unreasonable expense of others.

1183
01:26:42,930 --> 01:26:45,020
Cause then it becomes un-American.

1184
01:26:45,130 --> 01:26:47,069
That's why the price we pay for that gallon of milk

1185
01:26:47,229 --> 01:26:49,000
Could never represent the true cost of production

1186
01:26:49,100 --> 01:26:53,600
Cause it's got to be controlled. it's gotta be set. it's gotta be fair.

1187
01:26:53,710 --> 01:26:56,199
Gotta be controlled by who? I set a price that I think is fair.

1188
01:26:56,310 --> 01:26:57,609
I don't think it's fair. you don't?

1189
01:26:57,710 --> 01:26:59,180
I don't think it's fair. I think it's fair.

1190
01:26:59,279 --> 01:27:01,250
I mean, I know your customers are happy, frank,

1191
01:27:01,380 --> 01:27:04,079
Bunch of fucking junkies that they are.

1192
01:27:04,220 --> 01:27:08,710
But we fellow dairy farmers out here, frank, are you thinking of us?

1193
01:27:09,420 --> 01:27:10,949
You thinking of them?

1194
01:27:11,289 --> 01:27:12,949
The dairy farmers? yeah.

1195
01:27:13,430 --> 01:27:18,189
I'm thinking of them, dominic, about as much as they've ever thought about me.

1196
01:27:18,300 --> 01:27:20,630
I'm just thinking out loud now.

1197
01:27:21,130 --> 01:27:23,619
If you took some of your inventory, frank,

1198
01:27:23,939 --> 01:27:26,270
And you sold it wholesale...

1199
01:27:27,470 --> 01:27:28,670
Sit.

1200
01:27:29,539 --> 01:27:33,029
We could work. we could do some distribution.

1201
01:27:34,250 --> 01:27:35,479
I don't know. I'm pretty good, dominic.

1202
01:27:35,579 --> 01:27:39,520
You know, I got 110th, 155th, river to river. I'm all right.

1203
01:27:39,619 --> 01:27:42,550
That's kind of a mom and pop store next to what I'm talking about.

1204
01:27:42,659 --> 01:27:44,279
I mean, let's go at least bigger than kmart.

1205
01:27:44,390 --> 01:27:49,289
I'm talking about la, chicago, detroit, las vegas. let's go nationwide, huh?

1206
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:54,130
I'm gonna guarantee you your peace of mind here. you don't want that?

1207
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:57,180
You're going to need it.

1208
01:27:57,819 --> 01:27:59,449
I don't know how you view me, you know.

1209
01:27:59,560 --> 01:28:01,390
I'm kind of a renaissance man, frank.

1210
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:03,520
You know, the people I deal with on a daily basis,

1211
01:28:03,659 --> 01:28:05,460
You know, they're not enlightened, frank.

1212
01:28:05,560 --> 01:28:08,329
You talk to them about civil rights, they don't know, you know.

1213
01:28:08,430 --> 01:28:09,460
They're not open to change.

1214
01:28:10,229 --> 01:28:13,729
Not from the way things are done and who's doing it.

1215
01:28:13,869 --> 01:28:17,199
I talk to them, there's just no misunderstandings.

1216
01:28:18,579 --> 01:28:21,569
And that's what I mean by your peace of mind.

1217
01:28:26,250 --> 01:28:29,409
You're paying, what, $75,000, $80,000 a kilo?

1218
01:28:31,590 --> 01:28:33,720
I'm a renaissance man, too.

1219
01:28:34,890 --> 01:28:36,520
I'll consider $50,000.

1220
01:28:45,470 --> 01:28:48,699
Why would you trust these people? and the way they look at you...

1221
01:28:48,810 --> 01:28:51,170
They look at me like it's christmas and I'm santa claus.

1222
01:28:51,270 --> 01:28:53,939
They look at us like we're the help.

1223
01:28:54,609 --> 01:28:56,439
They work for me now.

1224
01:29:01,779 --> 01:29:03,750
I predict that when I meet joe frazier,

1225
01:29:03,890 --> 01:29:08,189
This will be like a good amateur fighting a real professional.

1226
01:29:08,289 --> 01:29:10,760
This will be like a kid out of the olympics...

1227
01:29:10,890 --> 01:29:13,260
Man 1: that's gonna be ali in like three.

1228
01:29:13,399 --> 01:29:15,630
You're not fighting oscar bonavena,

1229
01:29:15,770 --> 01:29:16,859
You're not fighting sonny liston.

1230
01:29:16,970 --> 01:29:17,989
You're fighting joe frazier.

1231
01:29:18,100 --> 01:29:19,729
Everybody knows that. that's not the point.

1232
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:21,170
He's all talk, man.

1233
01:29:21,270 --> 01:29:23,529
Look at frazier! ali gonna crush him, baby.

1234
01:29:23,640 --> 01:29:24,630
I'll stop him.

1235
01:29:24,739 --> 01:29:26,039
Stop me? you?

1236
01:29:26,140 --> 01:29:27,399
How soon? what round?

1237
01:29:27,510 --> 01:29:31,039
Don't let him obligate you. one to 10!

1238
01:29:31,149 --> 01:29:35,979
Tonight, march 8, 1971. here we are at madison square garden

1239
01:29:36,119 --> 01:29:37,590
For the fight of the century.

1240
01:29:37,689 --> 01:29:40,880
And by anybody's definition, this is a happening.

1241
01:29:40,989 --> 01:29:45,430
There are handshakes and, of course, there are utterly beautiful women.

1242
01:29:45,529 --> 01:29:47,689
But behind the smiles and behind the handshakes,

1243
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:52,100
You can feel the atmosphere is so heavy with tension, it's almost unbearable.

1244
01:29:52,869 --> 01:29:55,130
Everybody who is anybody is here.

1245
01:29:55,270 --> 01:29:58,970
Like sinatra. like graziano, david frost and diahann carroll.

1246
01:29:59,210 --> 01:30:03,010
And woody allen and diane keaton. the celebrities are pouring in.

1247
01:30:03,149 --> 01:30:07,239
The way you all build it up, life magazine cover, time magazine,

1248
01:30:07,350 --> 01:30:11,340
Everybody gives their opinion. dempsey says I'll lose. joe louis...

1249
01:30:11,489 --> 01:30:14,850
And when joe louis said I'm gonna lose, that's how I knew I'd won this one.

1250
01:30:14,989 --> 01:30:17,960
Joe louis always picks the wrong man!

1251
01:30:18,060 --> 01:30:20,149
Always picks the wrong man.

1252
01:30:20,300 --> 01:30:23,199
Joe louis is here tonight. watch your ass.

1253
01:30:23,329 --> 01:30:26,699
The official weight of joe frazier is 205.5 pounds.

1254
01:30:30,470 --> 01:30:33,369
Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee.

1255
01:30:33,710 --> 01:30:35,840
You're not watching the fight, bob?

1256
01:30:35,979 --> 01:30:37,840
I'm not into boxing.

1257
01:30:38,680 --> 01:30:40,979
This ain't boxing, kid.

1258
01:30:41,079 --> 01:30:42,779
It's politics.

1259
01:30:46,159 --> 01:30:47,779
I got something for you, too.

1260
01:30:47,890 --> 01:30:49,359
Yeah?

1261
01:30:51,989 --> 01:30:54,460
The coat? for me? mmm-hmm.

1262
01:30:55,430 --> 01:30:57,130
Do you like it?

1263
01:30:57,229 --> 01:30:59,699
The coat? yeah, yeah, it's nice.

1264
01:31:02,539 --> 01:31:04,340
What do you think? yeah.

1265
01:31:04,439 --> 01:31:06,199
You sure? yeah.

1266
01:31:13,779 --> 01:31:15,340
Photographer 1: over here, sammy.

1267
01:31:15,449 --> 01:31:17,850
Photographer 2: hey, sammy! give a look.

1268
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:21,359
Photographer 1: joe louis! over here!

1269
01:31:21,460 --> 01:31:22,789
How's it going, frank?

1270
01:31:22,890 --> 01:31:24,420
How are you, joe?

1271
01:31:33,640 --> 01:31:34,859
Now, ladies and gentlemen,

1272
01:31:34,970 --> 01:31:38,409
We have quite a list of introductions.

1273
01:31:38,539 --> 01:31:43,840
We are now going to introduce people from all endeavors of life.

1274
01:31:44,380 --> 01:31:46,439
And not just show people.

1275
01:31:46,579 --> 01:31:49,609
Because everyone is here tonight!

1276
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:03,390
Main event!

1277
01:32:05,569 --> 01:32:07,399
Fifteen rounds.

1278
01:32:07,500 --> 01:32:12,529
For the undisputed heavyweight championship of the world!

1279
01:32:12,640 --> 01:32:13,699
There we go, ali!

1280
01:32:13,810 --> 01:32:17,369
From louisville, kentucky, he's wearing red trunks.

1281
01:32:17,479 --> 01:32:18,850
Champ! this is frank lucas.

1282
01:32:18,949 --> 01:32:20,880
He weighs 215 pounds.

1283
01:32:22,079 --> 01:32:25,750
Here is muhammad ali!

1284
01:32:27,020 --> 01:32:31,050
His opponent, from philadelphia, pennsylvania,

1285
01:32:31,529 --> 01:32:33,789
He's wearing green trunks.

1286
01:32:34,199 --> 01:32:36,260
Who's that laughing with cattano?

1287
01:32:36,930 --> 01:32:39,029
How'd he get so fucking close to the ring?

1288
01:32:39,140 --> 01:32:42,229
The heavyweight champion of the world,

1289
01:32:42,340 --> 01:32:45,270
Joe frazier!

1290
01:32:47,609 --> 01:32:50,979
Hey, frank. you gonna keep that hat on all night?

1291
01:32:51,109 --> 01:32:52,140
I'm gonna miss the fight.

1292
01:32:52,250 --> 01:32:53,979
You paid for it.

1293
01:33:39,229 --> 01:33:41,220
This guy, he's a supplier at most. or just a pimp.

1294
01:33:41,329 --> 01:33:42,390
Otherwise we'd know his name.

1295
01:33:42,500 --> 01:33:46,329
His tickets were phenomenal. better seats than dominic cattano. right?

1296
01:33:46,970 --> 01:33:48,989
Joe louis shook his hand.

1297
01:33:50,010 --> 01:33:52,029
Who the fuck is this guy?

1298
01:33:55,850 --> 01:33:57,210
What's this?

1299
01:33:57,350 --> 01:33:59,539
That's the plate off the limo.

1300
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:01,619
Check with the company who rented it.

1301
01:34:05,149 --> 01:34:08,210
Right there, mr. lucas. right there. good.

1302
01:34:09,659 --> 01:34:12,130
Photographer 1: can I get a shot here, frank? right here.

1303
01:34:12,229 --> 01:34:13,659
Photographer 2: looking good, frank.

1304
01:34:14,500 --> 01:34:15,489
Beautiful.

1305
01:34:17,500 --> 01:34:18,899
Right on, frank!

1306
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:20,699
Congratulations!

1307
01:34:26,609 --> 01:34:28,470
She's the most beautiful bride I've ever seen.

1308
01:34:28,579 --> 01:34:30,840
That's my sunshine right there, mr. williams.

1309
01:34:30,949 --> 01:34:32,180
I wish bumpy had met her.

1310
01:34:32,279 --> 01:34:33,310
Throw it to me!

1311
01:34:38,689 --> 01:34:40,180
Get a picture.

1312
01:34:50,029 --> 01:34:51,659
Come here, baby.

1313
01:35:16,390 --> 01:35:19,050
What's happening? sit tight.

1314
01:35:20,229 --> 01:35:22,420
Congratulations, frank.

1315
01:35:22,569 --> 01:35:23,729
Detective.

1316
01:35:23,829 --> 01:35:27,100
So, you sure you done the right thing? I mean, she's beautiful girl and all...

1317
01:35:27,340 --> 01:35:29,460
Hey, hey, listen, listen.

1318
01:35:30,439 --> 01:35:32,460
Before you say anything about me or about my wife,

1319
01:35:32,609 --> 01:35:35,100
Understand this is the most important day of my life, detective.

1320
01:35:35,239 --> 01:35:36,729
Oh, I understand. I understand.

1321
01:35:36,850 --> 01:35:39,279
You know, a man who walks around in a $50,000 chinchilla coat

1322
01:35:39,420 --> 01:35:41,609
And never even bought me a cup of coffee.

1323
01:35:41,750 --> 01:35:44,909
There's something wrong there. pay your bills, frank?

1324
01:35:46,319 --> 01:35:47,409
I don't know what you're talking about.

1325
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:48,550
Do you pay your bills, I asked you?

1326
01:35:48,659 --> 01:35:49,890
If you're not getting your share,

1327
01:35:49,989 --> 01:35:51,359
Maybe you need to talk to the chief of police.

1328
01:35:51,460 --> 01:35:54,729
what's my share? cause you don't even fucking know me.

1329
01:35:55,630 --> 01:35:56,890
Maybe I'm special.

1330
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:58,829
You are special.

1331
01:35:58,970 --> 01:36:00,600
You see that right there?

1332
01:36:00,699 --> 01:36:02,970
Special investigations unit.

1333
01:36:04,210 --> 01:36:05,470
Special.

1334
01:36:06,340 --> 01:36:07,569
Get it?

1335
01:36:08,380 --> 01:36:10,810
Ten grand. first of each month.

1336
01:36:11,279 --> 01:36:13,310
Deliver it right here.

1337
01:36:13,449 --> 01:36:15,939
Are you done? oh, yeah, I'm done.

1338
01:36:18,949 --> 01:36:22,079
Don't forget your card. have a nice fucking honeymoon.

1339
01:36:22,189 --> 01:36:23,819
Let's go.

1340
01:37:23,119 --> 01:37:24,590
His name is frank lucas.

1341
01:37:24,689 --> 01:37:27,350
Originally from greensboro, north carolina.

1342
01:37:27,789 --> 01:37:32,689
A couple of arrests years ago. gambling and unlicensed firearm.

1343
01:37:33,359 --> 01:37:37,729
For 15 years, he was bumpy johnson's driver, bodyguard and collector.

1344
01:37:39,369 --> 01:37:41,100
He was with him when he died.

1345
01:37:41,239 --> 01:37:46,069
He's got five brothers. he's the oldest. and a lot of cousins.

1346
01:37:47,310 --> 01:37:51,079
They all living up here now, spread throughout the five boroughs and jersey.

1347
01:37:51,310 --> 01:37:53,539
The brothers are dexter,

1348
01:37:53,649 --> 01:37:55,840
In brooklyn. he's a dry cleaner. what can I do for you?

1349
01:37:55,949 --> 01:37:58,609
I'm picking up. yeah.

1350
01:37:58,750 --> 01:38:00,779
Melvin in queens has got a custom furniture

1351
01:38:00,920 --> 01:38:02,720
And fire doors business.

1352
01:38:04,159 --> 01:38:05,289
That's it right here? right there.

1353
01:38:05,430 --> 01:38:08,619
Terrence in newark, he has a hardware store.

1354
01:38:09,569 --> 01:38:12,130
Turner in the bronx has got a tire shop.

1355
01:38:13,770 --> 01:38:16,569
And huey lucas in bergen county has a body shop.

1356
01:38:16,670 --> 01:38:18,439
Is your manager here? that's my price.

1357
01:38:18,569 --> 01:38:20,130
Oh, man, I'm gonna take it somewhere else, all right?

1358
01:38:20,279 --> 01:38:23,369
These businesses are the distribution and collection points

1359
01:38:23,479 --> 01:38:26,039
For frank's dope and frank's money.

1360
01:38:26,619 --> 01:38:29,140
Everything about frank's life seems

1361
01:38:29,289 --> 01:38:31,880
Unpretentious, orderly and legitimate.

1362
01:38:32,819 --> 01:38:34,789
He starts early, gets up at 5:00 a.m.

1363
01:38:35,420 --> 01:38:39,220
Has breakfast in a diner in harlem every morning, usually by himself.

1364
01:38:39,329 --> 01:38:43,920
Then he starts work. takes a meeting with the accountant or with his lawyer.

1365
01:38:44,029 --> 01:38:47,260
At nights, he usually stays at home. and if he does go out,

1366
01:38:47,369 --> 01:38:51,399
It's to one of two clubs or a handful of restaurants with his new wife.

1367
01:38:51,510 --> 01:38:53,340
Some ball players. that's fucking wilt chamberlain.

1368
01:38:53,479 --> 01:38:57,779
Friends, musicians. never, never with organized crime guys.

1369
01:38:57,880 --> 01:39:00,640
Sundays, he takes his mother to church.

1370
01:39:01,180 --> 01:39:02,670
Then he drives out and he changes

1371
01:39:02,819 --> 01:39:06,810
The flowers on bumpy's grave. every sunday, no matter what.

1372
01:39:07,689 --> 01:39:10,489
Not the typical day in the life of a dope man, richie.

1373
01:39:10,630 --> 01:39:11,680
No.

1374
01:39:11,829 --> 01:39:15,630
Bumpy johnson's life wasn't typical either, and he ran harlem for years.

1375
01:39:15,760 --> 01:39:19,289
So you're saying that frank lucas replaced bumpy johnson?

1376
01:39:19,439 --> 01:39:20,800
Yeah. his driver?

1377
01:39:23,609 --> 01:39:26,130
But is it? is it? because everything he does...

1378
01:39:26,279 --> 01:39:27,970
He's handing out turkeys, man.

1379
01:39:28,109 --> 01:39:29,909
He does the same as bumpy would have done, right?

1380
01:39:30,010 --> 01:39:33,109
And who was bumpy most likely to teach?

1381
01:39:33,220 --> 01:39:35,270
The guy he sees every day.

1382
01:39:35,380 --> 01:39:37,680
It's like a sicilian family.

1383
01:39:37,819 --> 01:39:41,880
He's structured his organization to protect him in the same way.

1384
01:39:41,989 --> 01:39:43,390
And if he was with bumpy for so long,

1385
01:39:43,489 --> 01:39:46,090
That means he would have spent a lot of time with italians.

1386
01:39:46,199 --> 01:39:48,989
Definitely long enough to learn that much.

1387
01:39:49,130 --> 01:39:52,529
But here's the thing. I don't think it's frank lucas that we're after.

1388
01:39:53,539 --> 01:39:55,029
Who we want is whoever frank lucas is working for.

1389
01:39:57,670 --> 01:39:58,260
It's whoever's actually bringing the heroin in.

1390
01:39:58,369 --> 01:40:01,369
Okay. so what do you have on him

1391
01:40:04,149 --> 01:40:04,939
That will stick in court? because this isn't it.

1392
01:40:06,409 --> 01:40:10,250
Without powder, without informants, no one's going to jail.

1393
01:40:10,750 --> 01:40:11,909
That's understood, sir.

1394
01:40:12,020 --> 01:40:15,420
And I don't think we're gonna get informants, not from inside the family,

1395
01:40:15,520 --> 01:40:18,289
You know, unless we get very, very lucky.

1396
01:40:22,100 --> 01:40:24,399
Straight up lab tests suggesting

1397
01:40:24,569 --> 01:40:26,899
Purity's consistent with asian dope.

1398
01:40:27,899 --> 01:40:30,960
The italians, we know, usually work with other europeans

1399
01:40:31,069 --> 01:40:33,010
Or with the turks.

1400
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:36,369
We got small blue packets turning up

1401
01:40:36,539 --> 01:40:39,100
In neighborhoods all over the tri-state area.

1402
01:40:39,550 --> 01:40:41,949
From chinatown, to harlem, washington heights,

1403
01:40:42,050 --> 01:40:44,210
Richmond avenue and staten island.

1404
01:40:44,319 --> 01:40:47,119
They got north orange, princeton, bayonne, newark,

1405
01:40:48,119 --> 01:40:51,750
Syracuse, rochester, buffalo, and all the way through connecticut.

1406
01:40:51,859 --> 01:40:53,760
The same dope.

1407
01:40:57,100 --> 01:40:58,430
All right.

1408
01:41:02,949 --> 01:41:03,750
That's it, down there.

1409
01:41:48,430 --> 01:41:50,630
Okay, let's all join hands.

1410
01:41:54,970 --> 01:41:57,670
Lord, we thank you for this food we're about to receive,

1411
01:41:57,779 --> 01:41:59,710
The nourishments of our bodies.

1412
01:41:59,810 --> 01:42:04,210
Feed our souls with heavenly grace, in jesus' name and for his sake.

1413
01:42:04,680 --> 01:42:06,409
Amen. amen.

1414
01:42:26,869 --> 01:42:29,960
Hey, it's okay. it's okay. come on, now.

1415
01:42:31,479 --> 01:42:32,600
It's okay. shh.

1416
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:35,510
You better get yourself ready, old man.

1417
01:42:35,609 --> 01:42:37,670
Come on, big man. throw the ball.

1418
01:42:37,819 --> 01:42:40,149
Get yourself ready, old man. all right!

1419
01:42:40,479 --> 01:42:43,279
Come on, now. your pop said you had an arm on you. come on!

1420
01:42:43,390 --> 01:42:45,909
I'm gonna set your ass in the grass, uncle melvin.

1421
01:42:46,020 --> 01:42:48,579
Hey! watch your mouth, boy. throw the ball!

1422
01:42:48,689 --> 01:42:51,529
Damn, uncle melvin, I'm a pitcher, not an outfielder!

1423
01:42:51,659 --> 01:42:53,689
Steve. steve, come here.

1424
01:42:55,069 --> 01:42:56,090
Come, sit down.

1425
01:42:56,199 --> 01:42:58,289
Uncle frank. what's happening?

1426
01:42:59,239 --> 01:43:00,600
How you doing?

1427
01:43:00,699 --> 01:43:01,689
Cool.

1428
01:43:01,840 --> 01:43:03,140
You want a drink?

1429
01:43:03,239 --> 01:43:04,760
You know better than that.

1430
01:43:04,880 --> 01:43:06,170
Just checking.

1431
01:43:08,710 --> 01:43:11,939
Why didn't you show up for that meeting, steve?

1432
01:43:12,720 --> 01:43:15,810
I set it up with the yankees and billy martin.

1433
01:43:17,720 --> 01:43:19,689
Why didn't you show up?

1434
01:43:22,090 --> 01:43:23,720
Don't lie to me.

1435
01:43:24,329 --> 01:43:26,819
I don't want to play ball no more.

1436
01:43:27,399 --> 01:43:28,489
I decided. what you talking about?

1437
01:43:28,600 --> 01:43:30,460
You decided? decided what?

1438
01:43:30,829 --> 01:43:31,890
That ain't what I want.

1439
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,399
What you talking about? you've been playing since you was a little boy.

1440
01:43:34,539 --> 01:43:35,869
You were ready to go into the pros. what you...

1441
01:43:36,010 --> 01:43:38,300
Frank! we got a problem, man.

1442
01:43:41,680 --> 01:43:43,340
What do you want?

1443
01:43:44,850 --> 01:43:47,340
I want what you got, uncle frank.

1444
01:43:47,449 --> 01:43:49,149
I want to be you.

1445
01:44:08,760 --> 01:44:10,420
He's been diluting it so much.

1446
01:44:10,520 --> 01:44:12,189
We're down 2%%, 3%% pure.

1447
01:44:12,289 --> 01:44:14,779
And you tested it? you're sure?

1448
01:44:14,899 --> 01:44:15,859
Yeah.

1449
01:44:20,970 --> 01:44:21,960
Fuck you looking at?

1450
01:45:14,609 --> 01:45:15,800
My man.

1451
01:45:16,310 --> 01:45:18,170
Welcome, frank. how you doing, nick?

1452
01:45:20,960 --> 01:45:22,689
How you doing, nick? it's all great. welcome.

1453
01:45:22,930 --> 01:45:24,960
I need to talk to you. great. come on.

1454
01:45:25,069 --> 01:45:27,329
Hey, you all, everybody get out! let's go.

1455
01:45:27,500 --> 01:45:28,529
Come on! hurry up!

1456
01:45:31,310 --> 01:45:33,670
Sit, my brother.

1457
01:45:35,140 --> 01:45:37,340
I take it you talked to charlie.

1458
01:45:38,510 --> 01:45:40,909
Guess you wanna hear more about my black coalition.

1459
01:45:41,020 --> 01:45:42,539
Let me explain to you... no, no, no.

1460
01:45:42,649 --> 01:45:44,050
I'm all right.

1461
01:45:44,220 --> 01:45:45,579
That's not what I came here for, nick.

1462
01:45:46,949 --> 01:45:48,420
Yeah, everybody's good, nick.

1463
01:45:48,520 --> 01:45:51,550
You know, everybody's happy. charlie, baz, the italians,

1464
01:45:51,659 --> 01:45:53,720
You know, johnny law. everybody's happy except you.

1465
01:45:53,829 --> 01:45:55,020
I'm happy, frank.

1466
01:45:55,199 --> 01:45:56,390
You happy? really?

1467
01:45:56,500 --> 01:45:58,119
Well, maybe I'm the one with the problem.

1468
01:45:58,300 --> 01:45:59,960
Yeah, go on. get one.

1469
01:46:00,069 --> 01:46:01,130
All right.

1470
01:46:01,500 --> 01:46:02,489
I gotta problem 'cause

1471
01:46:02,600 --> 01:46:04,760
I don't understand why you gotta take

1472
01:46:04,869 --> 01:46:06,970
Something that's perfectly good

1473
01:46:07,069 --> 01:46:08,770
And mess it up.

1474
01:46:09,010 --> 01:46:10,140
See, brand names.

1475
01:46:10,239 --> 01:46:11,340
Brand names mean something. understand?

1476
01:46:12,609 --> 01:46:14,270
Shut the fuck up!

1477
01:46:15,250 --> 01:46:16,810
Go ahead, frank.

1478
01:46:16,920 --> 01:46:18,380
I'm sorry about that bullshit.

1479
01:46:18,520 --> 01:46:19,880
Blue magic.

1480
01:46:20,550 --> 01:46:22,180
That's a brand name.

1481
01:46:22,359 --> 01:46:24,050
Like pepsi, that's a brand name.

1482
01:46:24,189 --> 01:46:26,890
I stand behind it. I guarantee it.

1483
01:46:27,029 --> 01:46:29,149
They know that, even if they don't know me any more than

1484
01:46:29,260 --> 01:46:31,819
They know the chairman of general mills.

1485
01:46:31,930 --> 01:46:33,229
What the fuck are you talking about, frank?

1486
01:46:33,329 --> 01:46:36,170
What I'm talking about is when you chop my dope down

1487
01:46:36,270 --> 01:46:38,500
To one, two, three, four, five percent

1488
01:46:38,670 --> 01:46:40,939
And then you call it blue magic,

1489
01:46:41,039 --> 01:46:42,529
That is trademark infringement.

1490
01:46:42,710 --> 01:46:44,199
You understand what I'm saying?

1491
01:46:44,310 --> 01:46:46,800
With all due respect, frank, if I buy something, I own it.

1492
01:46:46,909 --> 01:46:48,180
No, that ain't true. that ain't true.

1493
01:46:48,279 --> 01:46:50,510
If I buy a car, and I wanna paint it, I can paint the motherfucker.

1494
01:46:50,619 --> 01:46:51,739
Yeah, but you don't have to.

1495
01:46:51,850 --> 01:46:53,340
This is what I'm saying to you, nick, you don't have to.

1496
01:46:53,449 --> 01:46:54,890
Good enough the way it is.

1497
01:46:54,989 --> 01:46:56,390
You can make enough money off it

1498
01:46:56,489 --> 01:46:57,789
The way it is, just by calling it blue magic.

1499
01:46:57,890 --> 01:46:59,720
Anything more than that is greed, son.

1500
01:46:59,829 --> 01:47:01,729
What you want, frank? you want me to change the name on it?

1501
01:47:01,829 --> 01:47:03,819
I would have to insist that you change the name.

1502
01:47:03,930 --> 01:47:05,829
Fine by me, frank. I'll call it red magic,

1503
01:47:05,930 --> 01:47:07,800
Even though that don't sound as good.

1504
01:47:07,899 --> 01:47:09,300
I don't give a fuck what you call it.

1505
01:47:09,399 --> 01:47:10,770
Put a chokehold on the motherfucker

1506
01:47:10,869 --> 01:47:13,500
And call it blue dog shit, you know what I mean?

1507
01:47:13,609 --> 01:47:17,840
I don't care, just don't let me catch you doing this again.

1508
01:47:17,949 --> 01:47:20,609
Catch me? infringement? insist?

1509
01:47:20,710 --> 01:47:22,510
I don't like these words as much as,

1510
01:47:22,619 --> 01:47:25,350
"please, thank you, I'm sorry to bother you, nicky."

1511
01:47:25,449 --> 01:47:27,579
These are better words you use to come to my motherfucking club

1512
01:47:27,689 --> 01:47:30,250
Without an invitation! you hear me?

1513
01:47:31,260 --> 01:47:32,489
My man.

1514
01:47:41,100 --> 01:47:45,300
Oh, shit. fuck, is that the cops there, man?

1515
01:47:53,359 --> 01:47:54,960
It's all right.

1516
01:47:56,069 --> 01:47:58,560
The hell they're gonna do, give us a ticket?

1517
01:47:59,069 --> 01:48:01,329
Stuff's in the car, frank.

1518
01:48:03,239 --> 01:48:04,229
What?

1519
01:48:04,369 --> 01:48:06,500
Some of it's in the trunk.

1520
01:48:08,180 --> 01:48:09,970
How you doing, frank? I'm good. how you doing, detective?

1521
01:48:10,079 --> 01:48:11,569
How was your thanksgiving?

1522
01:48:11,710 --> 01:48:13,979
Not so good, as a matter of fact. why don't you get out of the car?

1523
01:48:19,619 --> 01:48:20,680
Come on, give me the fucking keys.

1524
01:48:20,789 --> 01:48:22,659
Where's the shelby at? the shelby's gone?

1525
01:48:22,760 --> 01:48:24,520
The shelby's gone, frank. stay right there.

1526
01:48:24,630 --> 01:48:26,529
Yes, sir. right here.

1527
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:29,189
You got anything worth looking at in here?

1528
01:48:29,300 --> 01:48:31,029
Hey, that's that trupo guy.

1529
01:48:31,130 --> 01:48:32,729
Is that him? yeah.

1530
01:48:32,869 --> 01:48:34,359
Fucking prick.

1531
01:48:37,539 --> 01:48:39,939
Come over here a minute, frank. yeah.

1532
01:48:42,210 --> 01:48:43,270
What are we gonna do about this?

1533
01:48:43,409 --> 01:48:45,779
We don't do shit about it. we close it up, throw it back in the trunk,

1534
01:48:45,920 --> 01:48:48,510
Everybody go home, have some pumpkin pie, warm apple cider.

1535
01:48:48,619 --> 01:48:50,420
I got a better idea.

1536
01:48:51,590 --> 01:48:54,920
Or would you rather me throw you and your brother in the fucking river?

1537
01:48:55,060 --> 01:48:57,720
Would you rather your house blows up next time?

1538
01:49:02,300 --> 01:49:04,430
I loved that car. I know.

1539
01:49:07,899 --> 01:49:10,960
What's he doing? shakedown!

1540
01:49:11,670 --> 01:49:13,800
Somebody's getting some money for the benevolent fund.

1541
01:49:13,939 --> 01:49:14,930
Look at that shit.

1542
01:49:15,649 --> 01:49:16,939
Sorry, frank.

1543
01:49:17,079 --> 01:49:19,310
It's all right. go and get in the car.

1544
01:49:42,710 --> 01:49:45,470
All right, you call me back.

1545
01:49:47,600 --> 01:49:49,649
Ins, irs, FBI.

1546
01:49:49,659 --> 01:49:51,489
I can't get a damn thing out of any of them.

1547
01:49:51,569 --> 01:49:52,930
Because they all think you're on the take.

1548
01:49:53,100 --> 01:49:55,760
And you think they are.

1549
01:49:55,869 --> 01:49:58,800
You know, I don't think they want this to stop.

1550
01:49:58,909 --> 01:50:00,500
I think it employs too many people.

1551
01:50:01,579 --> 01:50:04,369
Judges, lawyers, cops, politicians,

1552
01:50:04,539 --> 01:50:07,510
Prison guards, probation officers.

1553
01:50:08,220 --> 01:50:09,180
They stop bringing dope into this country,

1554
01:50:09,279 --> 01:50:11,979
About 100,000 people are going to be out of a job.

1555
01:50:15,359 --> 01:50:18,319
Spearman.

1556
01:50:18,430 --> 01:50:21,789
FBI. here to see detective roberts.

1557
01:50:26,430 --> 01:50:30,100
So who took it out? somebody I know? my wife?

1558
01:50:31,470 --> 01:50:33,130
Come on, if somebody's taking a contract

1559
01:50:33,239 --> 01:50:34,869
Out on my life, I'd like to know.

1560
01:50:34,979 --> 01:50:38,569
I can't say without compromising our source. you understand?

1561
01:50:38,680 --> 01:50:41,079
No. not when it's my life, I don't understand.

1562
01:50:41,180 --> 01:50:42,670
If you want we can assign someone to you.

1563
01:50:42,850 --> 01:50:44,409
FBI protection.

1564
01:50:45,319 --> 01:50:48,720
You know what? my life is dangerous enough as it is.

1565
01:50:50,060 --> 01:50:51,890
Well, we'll let you get back to your business.

1566
01:50:51,989 --> 01:50:54,090
Okay. larry, bob.

1567
01:50:54,260 --> 01:50:56,420
Thanks for visiting the garden state.

1568
01:50:56,529 --> 01:50:57,659
Take care.

1569
01:50:57,760 --> 01:51:00,100
Hey, what do you know about frank lucas?

1570
01:51:00,199 --> 01:51:03,600
We know that you keep calling about him.

1571
01:51:13,310 --> 01:51:17,810
We believe that peace is at hand.

1572
01:51:19,890 --> 01:51:24,319
We believe that an agreement is within sight.

1573
01:51:27,090 --> 01:51:30,260
As I said earlier...

1574
01:51:34,770 --> 01:51:35,739
Yeah.

1575
01:51:36,970 --> 01:51:38,899
Hey, joey. hi.

1576
01:51:40,840 --> 01:51:43,670
All right. yeah, tomorrow. why?

1577
01:52:03,510 --> 01:52:04,409
What the fuck is a microwave?

1578
01:52:04,550 --> 01:52:07,880
It's a scientific force, like atomic energy.

1579
01:52:08,020 --> 01:52:09,850
Yeah? yeah.

1580
01:52:09,949 --> 01:52:12,079
It rearranges the molecules.

1581
01:52:12,220 --> 01:52:14,590
Of what? of what? of popcorn.

1582
01:52:17,760 --> 01:52:20,319
Of your head. stick it in. go on.

1583
01:52:23,529 --> 01:52:25,560
I can get you one of those.

1584
01:52:25,699 --> 01:52:29,000
Brand new, just like this. I'll have it delivered.

1585
01:52:29,409 --> 01:52:30,899
No, thank you.

1586
01:52:40,619 --> 01:52:42,640
Hey. where is that?

1587
01:52:42,750 --> 01:52:44,579
Aspen. we just got back.

1588
01:52:45,289 --> 01:52:46,949
Had a great time. you know who we met?

1589
01:52:47,060 --> 01:52:48,350
Who?

1590
01:52:49,060 --> 01:52:50,550
Burt reynolds.

1591
01:52:50,960 --> 01:52:54,020
Yeah? yeah? yeah. I'm not kidding.

1592
01:52:54,800 --> 01:52:58,729
A lot people from hollywood go up there now. they're buying up everything.

1593
01:52:58,829 --> 01:53:00,460
This is your place? mmm.

1594
01:53:00,600 --> 01:53:04,439
You know what that's worth? ski in, ski out. five bedrooms.

1595
01:53:04,569 --> 01:53:07,970
Sauna. everything. we were guests.

1596
01:53:12,409 --> 01:53:14,039
It's your place.

1597
01:53:29,159 --> 01:53:31,659
Isn't there something we can do,

1598
01:53:33,500 --> 01:53:36,060
About leaving the big guy alone?

1599
01:53:36,470 --> 01:53:38,409
You know who I mean.

1600
01:53:38,510 --> 01:53:42,069
I don't report what you just said, I can get in a lot of trouble.

1601
01:53:42,180 --> 01:53:45,149
I do report it, then the trouble is yours.

1602
01:53:47,180 --> 01:53:49,479
I'm hoping you won't do that.

1603
01:53:50,319 --> 01:53:52,840
Richie, come on. I'm not taping it.

1604
01:53:52,989 --> 01:53:55,819
How do you know? because we're friends.

1605
01:53:56,159 --> 01:53:58,590
And I'm telling you, this is a real offer.

1606
01:53:58,689 --> 01:54:00,590
From who? your uncle?

1607
01:54:04,300 --> 01:54:06,789
Why would you do this? why would you risk our friendship?

1608
01:54:06,899 --> 01:54:08,270
Because

1609
01:54:10,539 --> 01:54:12,840
I care what happens to you.

1610
01:54:14,909 --> 01:54:16,779
You shouldn't have done this.

1611
01:54:16,880 --> 01:54:19,939
I had to, I had no choice. neither do you. richie!

1612
01:54:20,819 --> 01:54:24,619
You don't have a choice. just leave frank lucas alone.

1613
01:54:26,319 --> 01:54:27,760
Frank lucas?

1614
01:54:28,989 --> 01:54:30,119
Yeah.

1615
01:54:32,800 --> 01:54:35,659
You tell marie I had to leave. I'm sorry.

1616
01:54:36,500 --> 01:54:37,970
Tell her why.

1617
01:55:20,880 --> 01:55:22,340
Don't shoot! don't shoot! talk! talk! don't shoot!

1618
01:55:22,439 --> 01:55:24,739
Are you richie roberts? yes, so what?

1619
01:55:25,680 --> 01:55:27,510
You've been served. I'm sorry.

1620
01:55:42,260 --> 01:55:43,250
All right.

1621
01:55:47,270 --> 01:55:48,260
Laurie.

1622
01:55:50,409 --> 01:55:54,100
Look, I'm sorry I never gave you the kind of life you wanted, all right.

1623
01:55:54,239 --> 01:55:56,539
I'm sorry it was never enough.

1624
01:55:59,649 --> 01:56:02,279
Don't punish me for being honest.

1625
01:56:02,420 --> 01:56:04,390
Don't take my boy away.

1626
01:56:06,760 --> 01:56:10,090
What are you saying? that because you were honest

1627
01:56:10,229 --> 01:56:13,390
And you didn't take money like every other cop, I left you?

1628
01:56:13,500 --> 01:56:16,020
No, you don't take money for one reason.

1629
01:56:16,130 --> 01:56:18,930
To buy being dishonest about everything else.

1630
01:56:19,439 --> 01:56:21,430
And that's worse than taking money nobody gives a shit about.

1631
01:56:21,569 --> 01:56:24,539
Drug money, gambling money nobody's gonna miss.

1632
01:56:24,939 --> 01:56:28,399
You know, I'd rather you took it and been honest with me.

1633
01:56:28,510 --> 01:56:31,210
Or don't take it. I don't care. but then don't go cheat on me.

1634
01:56:31,310 --> 01:56:34,409
Don't cheat on your kid by never being around. don't go out and get laid

1635
01:56:34,520 --> 01:56:37,449
By your snitches and your secretaries and strippers!

1636
01:56:37,590 --> 01:56:40,319
I can tell by just looking, she's one of them.

1637
01:56:40,460 --> 01:56:41,449
You...

1638
01:56:41,760 --> 01:56:46,060
You think you're going to heaven because you're honest, but you're not.

1639
01:56:46,460 --> 01:56:49,060
You're going to the same hell as the crooked cops you can't stand.

1640
01:56:50,329 --> 01:56:51,890
All rise.

1641
01:56:56,310 --> 01:56:58,300
Please be seated.

1642
01:56:59,479 --> 01:57:01,170
Miss dickerson,

1643
01:57:01,310 --> 01:57:03,800
Before the court renders its opinion,

1644
01:57:03,949 --> 01:57:06,609
Is there anything else you'd like to be heard on?

1645
01:57:06,720 --> 01:57:08,439
Yes, your honor.

1646
01:57:08,550 --> 01:57:11,680
Your honor, a lot has been said here today about how unsavory

1647
01:57:11,819 --> 01:57:15,779
Mr. roberts' environment is for a child. how dangerous it is.

1648
01:57:15,890 --> 01:57:19,659
We tell him to protect us. we give him that responsibility,

1649
01:57:19,800 --> 01:57:22,319
But then say, "oh, we don't trust you to raise a child.

1650
01:57:22,460 --> 01:57:23,989
"we don't think you're fit for that."

1651
01:57:24,100 --> 01:57:25,689
I'm not.

1652
01:57:26,500 --> 01:57:27,970
You're right.

1653
01:57:29,170 --> 01:57:31,609
Being around me is no place for a kid.

1654
01:57:31,710 --> 01:57:34,939
You take him to vegas. I'll come see him when I can.

1655
01:57:37,880 --> 01:57:41,510
Your honor, I want to apologize for wasting the court's time.

1656
01:57:53,399 --> 01:57:55,090
Doc.

1657
01:57:55,199 --> 01:57:56,600
I see them.

1658
01:57:56,699 --> 01:57:58,189
There he is.

1659
01:58:16,720 --> 01:58:18,350
The fuck is this guy doing?

1660
01:58:19,119 --> 01:58:20,449
Hey! champagne.

1661
01:58:20,560 --> 01:58:22,750
Merry christmas, detectives. for us?

1662
01:58:22,859 --> 01:58:24,689
Yeah. enjoy that.

1663
01:58:25,060 --> 01:58:27,390
You fellas have a good time. mmm-hmm.

1664
01:58:28,800 --> 01:58:30,359
It's cristal.

1665
01:58:34,199 --> 01:58:36,500
South vietnamese troops called in air strikes

1666
01:58:36,609 --> 01:58:39,539
On communist positions inside the city.

1667
01:58:41,039 --> 01:58:43,739
Paying off johnny law, that's one thing.

1668
01:58:43,850 --> 01:58:45,439
There ain't no problem with that.

1669
01:58:45,550 --> 01:58:48,239
I've been paying off the police since I was 10 years old.

1670
01:58:48,350 --> 01:58:51,010
Put more of their kids through college than the national merit award.

1671
01:58:51,149 --> 01:58:52,920
Give me one of them round one... yeah.

1672
01:58:53,020 --> 01:58:54,960
This is different, though. these...

1673
01:58:55,060 --> 01:58:58,960
Special investigative unit. that's their problem. they think they're special.

1674
01:58:59,060 --> 01:59:01,689
Fucking crooks. no code of ethics.

1675
01:59:01,829 --> 01:59:02,850
What do you think?

1676
01:59:02,970 --> 01:59:05,090
Looks great. it's beautiful.

1677
01:59:05,399 --> 01:59:06,529
Good.

1678
01:59:07,140 --> 01:59:09,189
The police, that ain't the only somebody I'm worried about.

1679
01:59:09,300 --> 01:59:12,270
I seeing cars where I ain't never seen them before, people I don't know.

1680
01:59:12,409 --> 01:59:13,369
Yeah, me, too.

1681
01:59:17,060 --> 01:59:18,260
Merry christmas, charlie.

1682
01:59:18,359 --> 01:59:19,460
Thank you.

1683
01:59:19,560 --> 01:59:20,829
I love you.

1684
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:22,300
I love you, too.

1685
01:59:23,800 --> 01:59:25,630
Here, take this.

1686
01:59:25,899 --> 01:59:27,600
A quick toast, and then I'll be off.

1687
01:59:27,939 --> 01:59:30,270
What happened here was an accident of war.

1688
01:59:30,439 --> 01:59:32,810
Somebody made a mistake.

1689
01:59:33,810 --> 01:59:36,010
Bumpy ain't hardly ever go out no more.

1690
01:59:36,180 --> 01:59:38,409
After a certain point he stayed in the house.

1691
01:59:41,189 --> 01:59:43,350
Watch tv.

1692
01:59:44,659 --> 01:59:46,619
Play chess. read the newspaper.

1693
01:59:48,289 --> 01:59:50,390
I thought he was just trying to lead the quiet life,

1694
01:59:50,500 --> 01:59:52,550
But no, he couldn't go nowhere.

1695
01:59:52,659 --> 01:59:54,130
Not without something happening.

1696
01:59:54,300 --> 01:59:55,789
Frankie...

1697
01:59:55,970 --> 01:59:57,560
We can still go out.

1698
01:59:57,739 --> 01:59:59,359
With who? where?

1699
01:59:59,470 --> 02:00:01,100
Well, with...

1700
02:00:01,270 --> 02:00:02,859
But I know he's under surveillance.

1701
02:00:04,039 --> 02:00:05,699
Ain't gonna be no christmas time

1702
02:00:05,880 --> 02:00:07,609
With my family being here no more.

1703
02:00:07,710 --> 02:00:10,840
Why don't you just pay who you have to pay?

1704
02:00:10,949 --> 02:00:13,039
I do pay them. I pay thousands and millions

1705
02:00:13,220 --> 02:00:15,310
To dope dealers, crooks, cops.

1706
02:00:15,789 --> 02:00:16,850
I pay everybody.

1707
02:00:17,020 --> 02:00:18,109
I pay more than they should get.

1708
02:00:18,220 --> 02:00:20,380
I can't satisfy nobody!

1709
02:00:20,489 --> 02:00:22,550
It's like dope! everybody's strung out!

1710
02:00:22,659 --> 02:00:24,689
The more you give 'em, the more they want.

1711
02:00:24,829 --> 02:00:27,130
They expect more.

1712
02:00:28,130 --> 02:00:30,329
Give more and they want more.

1713
02:00:35,039 --> 02:00:37,130
Do you want to go out?

1714
02:00:38,079 --> 02:00:40,039
All right, baby. put something of what you got.

1715
02:00:40,149 --> 02:00:41,340
Should i? yeah.

1716
02:00:41,449 --> 02:00:42,640
That's christmas spirit.

1717
02:00:42,750 --> 02:00:44,979
That's what I'm talking about. feliz navidad.

1718
02:00:45,079 --> 02:00:46,810
Something nice? mmm-hmm.

1719
02:00:54,560 --> 02:00:55,890
We're going to have a great time.

1720
02:00:55,989 --> 02:00:57,090
That's right, chica.

1721
02:00:57,199 --> 02:00:59,760
Mr. lucas. enjoy your evening.

1722
02:01:00,800 --> 02:01:02,359
It's all clear.

1723
02:01:06,720 --> 02:01:07,449
Nicky!

1724
02:01:07,550 --> 02:01:09,350
Who is that? there's your boy, nicky. see him?

1725
02:01:09,460 --> 02:01:10,449
Know what I'm saying?

1726
02:01:10,560 --> 02:01:13,149
Yeah, I see him. let's keep going.

1727
02:01:13,890 --> 02:01:14,949
Around back?

1728
02:01:15,060 --> 02:01:18,159
Hell, no. I ain't sneaking into my own club.

1729
02:01:18,569 --> 02:01:20,500
Incredible. huh?

1730
02:01:42,760 --> 02:01:44,159
Come on.

1731
02:01:47,029 --> 02:01:48,050
Hold on. hold on.

1732
02:01:56,500 --> 02:01:57,529
What?

1733
02:01:57,670 --> 02:01:59,470
I want to wait in the car.

1734
02:01:59,569 --> 02:02:02,630
Frank, I got it. I got it. I'll wait for it. I got it.

1735
02:02:03,039 --> 02:02:05,069
Get that yellow sauce. yellow sauce.

1736
02:02:05,210 --> 02:02:07,239
And the chicken. the kung pao chicken.

1737
02:02:13,520 --> 02:02:15,250
Can you turn the heater on?

1738
02:02:21,600 --> 02:02:23,760
Shit. I'm gonna go get the keys.

1739
02:02:37,710 --> 02:02:40,239
Doc, give me the keys. here you go.

1740
02:02:45,989 --> 02:02:47,250
Doc!

1741
02:02:51,390 --> 02:02:53,189
Get out of the car.

1742
02:02:59,630 --> 02:03:01,569
You okay? yeah.

1743
02:03:01,670 --> 02:03:02,729
Shit.

1744
02:03:04,069 --> 02:03:06,100
Come on, baby. you all right?

1745
02:03:07,069 --> 02:03:08,369
Let's go.

1746
02:03:29,029 --> 02:03:30,500
Was it nicky?

1747
02:03:32,170 --> 02:03:34,500
We'll go right now and fucking kill him whether it was him or not,

1748
02:03:34,640 --> 02:03:36,569
You say the word, frankie.

1749
02:03:38,109 --> 02:03:40,439
We got to do something, frank.

1750
02:03:40,869 --> 02:03:41,899
We can't just sit here.

1751
02:03:42,010 --> 02:03:43,500
We're leaving.

1752
02:03:46,649 --> 02:03:48,310
All right, everybody get out. you all right, man?

1753
02:03:48,449 --> 02:03:50,579
Go on home. it's christmas time. go and be with your families.

1754
02:03:50,680 --> 02:03:51,979
I'm all right.

1755
02:03:52,119 --> 02:03:55,020
Go on. go ahead. be with your kids.

1756
02:03:55,159 --> 02:03:56,449
Go ahead.

1757
02:04:08,640 --> 02:04:09,689
Where are we gonna go, huh?

1758
02:04:09,840 --> 02:04:11,430
We're gonna go to spain, somewhere? china?

1759
02:04:11,539 --> 02:04:15,029
Huh? come on, sit down. tell me where you want to go.

1760
02:04:15,710 --> 02:04:18,640
Frank, we can go anywhere we want.

1761
02:04:18,750 --> 02:04:20,649
No, we can't. we can live anywhere, frank.

1762
02:04:20,750 --> 02:04:22,439
Where? and do what? run? hide?

1763
02:04:22,550 --> 02:04:25,479
Frank lucas don't run from nobody, baby.

1764
02:04:25,590 --> 02:04:27,380
We ain't going nowhere. we're gonna stay right here.

1765
02:04:27,520 --> 02:04:29,789
We're gonna stay right here. this is my home.

1766
02:04:29,890 --> 02:04:33,189
This is where my business is, my wife, my mother, my family.

1767
02:04:33,329 --> 02:04:35,800
My country. I ain't going nowhere.

1768
02:04:36,500 --> 02:04:38,689
I ain't running from nobody!

1769
02:04:40,069 --> 02:04:41,689
This is America.

1770
02:04:48,510 --> 02:04:51,069
And you ain't going nowhere, either!

1771
02:04:53,109 --> 02:04:54,239
Huh?

1772
02:04:56,550 --> 02:04:59,210
A ceasefire, internationally supervised, will begin

1773
02:04:59,350 --> 02:05:03,649
At 7:00 p.m. this saturday, january 27th, washington time.

1774
02:05:03,760 --> 02:05:05,779
I'll call you back.

1775
02:05:06,060 --> 02:05:08,289
Hey! what are you doing?

1776
02:05:10,500 --> 02:05:11,689
Richie.

1777
02:05:18,909 --> 02:05:23,710
So, what I hear it was the corsican mob took a shot at frank.

1778
02:05:23,840 --> 02:05:25,680
You know, french connection, fernando rey,

1779
02:05:25,779 --> 02:05:28,149
The exporters that frank has put out of business.

1780
02:05:29,550 --> 02:05:31,680
Look, I can take care of him in new york.

1781
02:05:31,789 --> 02:05:33,250
I just don't want to have to worry that every time

1782
02:05:33,390 --> 02:05:34,850
He drives across the bridge to jersey,

1783
02:05:34,960 --> 02:05:37,750
Someone's gonna take another shot at him.

1784
02:05:37,890 --> 02:05:41,159
Richie, you and I gotta start working together.

1785
02:05:41,630 --> 02:05:43,989
We need to step up our efforts.

1786
02:05:44,359 --> 02:05:47,029
Next time, their aim could be better.

1787
02:05:47,630 --> 02:05:50,229
We need to keep this cash cow alive.

1788
02:05:56,079 --> 02:05:58,270
What the fuck are you doing here?

1789
02:06:03,319 --> 02:06:07,250
Were you actually gonna arrest frank lucas? what's the matter with you?

1790
02:06:07,649 --> 02:06:09,850
What, you don't know? no.

1791
02:06:10,560 --> 02:06:13,079
Everybody in new jersey's crazy. oh.

1792
02:06:13,630 --> 02:06:17,060
You know what we do here? cops arrest bad guys.

1793
02:06:19,300 --> 02:06:21,289
Before you get on that bridge again,

1794
02:06:21,439 --> 02:06:24,800
You should call me first, just make sure it's safe.

1795
02:06:28,010 --> 02:06:31,600
"i'm more enlightened than some of my friends. I can guarantee you peace of mind."

1796
02:06:31,750 --> 02:06:34,039
That's what you told me, dominic.

1797
02:06:35,319 --> 02:06:37,880
"i can guarantee you peace of mind!"

1798
02:06:37,989 --> 02:06:40,039
I don't feel so peaceful!

1799
02:06:45,090 --> 02:06:47,289
They tried to kill my wife!

1800
02:06:51,699 --> 02:06:53,260
Who was that? huh?

1801
02:06:55,470 --> 02:06:57,840
Maybe it was one of your peoples.

1802
02:06:57,970 --> 02:07:00,170
I don't know yet. no. you don't know?

1803
02:07:00,310 --> 02:07:01,829
You don't know.

1804
02:07:03,210 --> 02:07:06,149
I'll tell you what I know. maybe I should just put 500 guns

1805
02:07:06,279 --> 02:07:08,340
Out there on the street and just start shooting up some people,

1806
02:07:08,449 --> 02:07:09,439
Just to make a point.

1807
02:07:09,550 --> 02:07:12,850
Frank, it was a junkie. it was a rival. some dumb-ass kid

1808
02:07:12,989 --> 02:07:16,680
Trying to make a name for himself. somebody you forgot to pay off.

1809
02:07:16,819 --> 02:07:19,760
Someone you slighted without even realizing it.

1810
02:07:19,859 --> 02:07:24,130
Could be someone you put out of business from being so successful. look at you.

1811
02:07:24,970 --> 02:07:28,529
Success, it's got enemies, frank. lots of enemies.

1812
02:07:30,170 --> 02:07:32,699
So your success took a shot at you. what are you gonna do now?

1813
02:07:32,840 --> 02:07:36,500
How you gonna kill it? you're gonna become unsuccessful?

1814
02:07:37,479 --> 02:07:40,310
Frank, we can be successful and have enemies, right?

1815
02:07:40,710 --> 02:07:43,979
Or we can be unsuccessful, too, you know, we can have friends.

1816
02:07:44,890 --> 02:07:46,979
That's the choice we make.

1817
02:07:48,390 --> 02:07:52,020
The final evacuation of military and diplomatic personnel

1818
02:07:52,159 --> 02:07:56,529
Continued throughout the night, as north vietnamese troops marched on saigon.

1819
02:07:56,859 --> 02:07:59,869
The imminent fall of the city has brought

1820
02:07:59,869 --> 02:08:01,989
 chaos and a growing sense of desperation.

1821
02:08:11,010 --> 02:08:14,409
International.

1822
02:08:14,550 --> 02:08:16,069
One moment, please.

1823
02:08:24,460 --> 02:08:25,819
Yeah, nate.

1824
02:08:25,930 --> 02:08:27,590
Hey, frank. what's up, baby?

1825
02:08:27,729 --> 02:08:29,090
What's going on over there?

1826
02:08:29,199 --> 02:08:30,390
It's all over.

1827
02:08:30,529 --> 02:08:32,359
Yeah, I'm watching the news. what the hell's going on?

1828
02:08:32,470 --> 02:08:34,159
The game's over, frank.

1829
02:08:34,270 --> 02:08:35,600
Huh? it's done.

1830
02:08:35,739 --> 02:08:37,699
Everybody going home, baby. give peace a chance.

1831
02:08:37,800 --> 02:08:39,170
Well, look, I'm not... listen to me.

1832
02:08:39,270 --> 02:08:40,829
I want two...

1833
02:08:41,810 --> 02:08:44,609
I want 2,000 keys in the air.

1834
02:08:44,739 --> 02:08:48,010
It's impossible, frank. all our resources are going home. it's over.

1835
02:08:48,119 --> 02:08:49,880
I'll tell you what. I'm on my way over there.

1836
02:08:49,979 --> 02:08:51,920
Right now? oh, come... yeah.

1837
02:08:59,289 --> 02:09:01,449
You stole my shit?

1838
02:09:01,600 --> 02:09:03,689
Spearman, wake the fuck up, man. what?

1839
02:09:05,630 --> 02:09:07,189
Where's my shit, darlynn?

1840
02:09:07,300 --> 02:09:09,270
Don't hurt me, jimmy!

1841
02:09:10,899 --> 02:09:12,739
Jesus! what the... police! police!

1842
02:09:12,840 --> 02:09:14,640
Drop the gun, jimmy! drop the gun!

1843
02:09:14,770 --> 02:09:16,970
Let me see your hands! jimmy, drop the fucking gun!

1844
02:09:17,109 --> 02:09:19,869
I'm not playing with you, jimmy! I'll blast your fucking head off!

1845
02:09:19,979 --> 02:09:21,779
Don't shoot! don't shoot!

1846
02:09:23,520 --> 02:09:26,609
I got your gun and I got your prints.

1847
02:09:27,920 --> 02:09:31,119
You know what you got? you got attempted murder.

1848
02:09:32,329 --> 02:09:34,229
Fifteen fucking years!

1849
02:09:34,630 --> 02:09:37,960
Attempted murder is the same as murder one, that's a grand jury.

1850
02:09:38,100 --> 02:09:40,329
Now, a grand jury could come back favorably.

1851
02:09:40,470 --> 02:09:43,560
It could be reduced to manslaughter.

1852
02:09:43,670 --> 02:09:45,829
All right? maybe even self-defense.

1853
02:09:45,970 --> 02:09:47,800
It all just depends on how we wanna deal with you.

1854
02:09:47,939 --> 02:09:49,909
See where this is fucking going, jimmy?

1855
02:09:50,010 --> 02:09:53,470
Let's say you beat it. what you think your cousin frank is gonna think?

1856
02:09:53,609 --> 02:09:55,949
Right, he is gonna know, at some point in time,

1857
02:09:56,050 --> 02:09:58,520
We sat you down, and we talked to you like this.

1858
02:09:58,649 --> 02:10:01,310
And then you go to court and you beat attempted murder?

1859
02:10:01,449 --> 02:10:04,909
What's he gonna think? is he stupid? is your cousin frank stupid?

1860
02:10:05,029 --> 02:10:06,930
Answer him!

1861
02:10:07,029 --> 02:10:09,689
No. he's going to assume that you talked.

1862
02:10:12,899 --> 02:10:15,300
But right now, frank doesn't know.

1863
02:10:15,399 --> 02:10:17,800
You want frank to read about this in the papers?

1864
02:10:17,899 --> 02:10:19,869
Or do you just want to walk out of here?

1865
02:10:20,010 --> 02:10:23,640
No bail, no trial, no jail, just walk out of here today.

1866
02:10:24,739 --> 02:10:26,210
Your choice.

1867
02:10:36,020 --> 02:10:40,520
Opium plants are hard enough to outlive any war.

1868
02:10:41,829 --> 02:10:45,960
They'll still be here long after the troops have gone.

1869
02:10:47,329 --> 02:10:51,960
What are you going to do for transportation when the last us plane goes home?

1870
02:10:52,510 --> 02:10:54,470
I'll figure something out.

1871
02:10:56,010 --> 02:10:58,380
You will see me again, that's for sure.

1872
02:11:00,050 --> 02:11:03,020
It is not in my best interest to say this, frank,

1873
02:11:03,550 --> 02:11:06,520
But quitting while you're ahead

1874
02:11:07,220 --> 02:11:09,020
Is not the same as quitting.

1875
02:11:50,899 --> 02:11:52,329
Yeah. hey.

1876
02:11:52,430 --> 02:11:53,420
Go get him.

1877
02:11:56,340 --> 02:11:58,630
What are you want to do, baby. one second.

1878
02:11:58,770 --> 02:12:00,470
It's frank. yeah.

1879
02:12:03,010 --> 02:12:04,069
Yeah.

1880
02:12:04,180 --> 02:12:05,470
Newark.

1881
02:12:06,350 --> 02:12:07,970
Short term,

1882
02:12:08,520 --> 02:12:10,140
Parking lot three.

1883
02:12:11,079 --> 02:12:12,479
Short term, lot three.

1884
02:12:12,920 --> 02:12:15,020
That's the mustang we talking about, right?

1885
02:12:15,020 --> 02:12:16,149
okay, right. what's the plate number?

1886
02:12:16,289 --> 02:12:18,760
K-a... k-a...
K-a... k-a...

1887
02:12:18,859 --> 02:12:20,989
760  76
760. 76.

1888
02:12:21,130 --> 02:12:22,789
Zero. all right.

1889
02:12:24,159 --> 02:12:26,159
There's no short term lot three at newark.

1890
02:12:26,300 --> 02:12:28,489
They got letters. a-b-c-d. I know.

1891
02:12:28,640 --> 02:12:30,430
Maybe he means a time. 3:00?

1892
02:12:31,100 --> 02:12:35,729
This isn't no jersey license plate, nor new york, for that matter.

1893
02:12:36,010 --> 02:12:38,770
K-a-7-6-0? yup.

1894
02:12:39,810 --> 02:12:41,439
Kilo alpha?

1895
02:12:41,979 --> 02:12:43,609
A plane tail number?

1896
02:12:44,020 --> 02:12:45,989
Kilo alpha 760.

1897
02:12:47,149 --> 02:12:49,949
You check commercial planes. you guys check private planes.

1898
02:12:50,060 --> 02:12:52,819
Everything, from a little fucking cessna to the biggest fucking whatever jet.

1899
02:12:52,960 --> 02:12:54,020
All right?

1900
02:12:54,159 --> 02:12:55,489
I'll check military planes. where you going, jimmy?

1901
02:12:55,630 --> 02:12:57,789
You're not going anywhere. sit... sit down.

1902
02:13:21,189 --> 02:13:22,619
Captain? yeah?

1903
02:13:22,720 --> 02:13:26,680
Richie roberts. essex county. I know you're expecting us.

1904
02:13:27,090 --> 02:13:29,619
Here's our warrant. we're looking on the plane.

1905
02:13:29,729 --> 02:13:30,890
Wait! wait!

1906
02:13:31,029 --> 02:13:34,470
Scotty, stop all these soldiers! check their bags. every one of them.

1907
02:13:44,880 --> 02:13:46,510
No-knock warrant.

1908
02:13:47,250 --> 02:13:49,840
All right. start upstairs. where are they going?

1909
02:13:49,949 --> 02:13:51,079
Step in, sweetie.

1910
02:13:51,890 --> 02:13:53,409
Ma'am, please sit down.

1911
02:13:53,550 --> 02:13:54,710
What is this?

1912
02:13:55,560 --> 02:13:59,010
Whoa, whoa, whoa! all this stops! hey. hey. hey.

1913
02:13:59,130 --> 02:14:02,029
Nothing leaves this area, all right? just slow down with this.

1914
02:14:02,560 --> 02:14:04,529
All right. stop these trucks. hold on, hold on.

1915
02:14:04,630 --> 02:14:06,569
Everything off the walls! just pull it all down.

1916
02:14:06,699 --> 02:14:08,000
Damn thing's a monster, rich.

1917
02:14:08,100 --> 02:14:09,090
What is this?

1918
02:14:09,239 --> 02:14:10,359
Nothing leaves this area till we've checked it.

1919
02:14:10,470 --> 02:14:11,770
All right, captain. nothing.

1920
02:14:11,869 --> 02:14:13,899
We got to take the plane down, we got to look in the trucks.

1921
02:14:14,039 --> 02:14:15,229
Every man here gets searched.

1922
02:14:15,380 --> 02:14:16,739
Read the warrant, sir.

1923
02:14:17,909 --> 02:14:20,380
Your husband's illustrious career is over.

1924
02:14:21,210 --> 02:14:24,409
The feds are gonna come in, gonna take everything.

1925
02:14:24,819 --> 02:14:28,779
And then they're gonna take it all. but not before I get my gratuity.

1926
02:14:29,920 --> 02:14:31,149
So where's the money?

1927
02:14:31,260 --> 02:14:32,819
What are you talking about? what money?

1928
02:14:32,930 --> 02:14:34,479
What am I talking about? what money?

1929
02:14:34,590 --> 02:14:38,689
The getaway money that frank and every other gangster keeps in his house.

1930
02:14:38,800 --> 02:14:42,100
If you leave now, there's a chance frank might not kill you.

1931
02:14:43,939 --> 02:14:45,460
Shut up! sit down!

1932
02:14:45,609 --> 02:14:46,869
Sit down!

1933
02:15:27,579 --> 02:15:29,909
Defense today announced the planned evacuation

1934
02:15:30,020 --> 02:15:33,039
Of all remaining us combat forces from vietnam,

1935
02:15:33,149 --> 02:15:35,880
News that comes too late for some,

1936
02:15:35,989 --> 02:15:39,619
As here, on a solemn tarmac at dover air force base.

1937
02:15:39,760 --> 02:15:43,250
This c-130, loaded down with its sorrowful cargo,

1938
02:15:43,359 --> 02:15:47,600
A cargo of America's bravest and best, en route to their final resting places.

1939
02:16:03,279 --> 02:16:04,750
You guys. take this coffin down.

1940
02:16:13,289 --> 02:16:14,920
Open it. I'm not doing that.

1941
02:16:21,699 --> 02:16:23,670
Great fucking dog, huh?

1942
02:16:31,680 --> 02:16:33,540
You stop this, right now.

1943
02:16:33,680 --> 02:16:36,549
My warrant gives me permission to examine this plane,

1944
02:16:37,850 --> 02:16:39,319
The plane and its cargo.

1945
02:16:39,819 --> 02:16:41,840
Well, you don't have my permission.

1946
02:16:42,860 --> 02:16:44,319
I don't need it, captain.

1947
02:16:46,030 --> 02:16:48,649
Easy! easy, boy. come on. hey!

1948
02:16:49,530 --> 02:16:51,500
Frank, move out of the way.

1949
02:16:58,540 --> 02:16:59,840
Damn.

1950
02:17:04,709 --> 02:17:05,909
That's enough!

1951
02:17:13,719 --> 02:17:15,690
Stay with these coffins. do not let them out of your sight.

1952
02:17:15,790 --> 02:17:17,090
Got it. okay.

1953
02:17:18,729 --> 02:17:20,020
Hey. help me out with this.

1954
02:17:45,489 --> 02:17:47,920
That was a military transport plane.

1955
02:17:48,049 --> 02:17:49,209
If there was heroin was onboard,

1956
02:17:49,319 --> 02:17:51,120
Then someone in the military would have to be involved.

1957
02:17:51,260 --> 02:17:53,950
Which means that even as it fights a war that's claimed

1958
02:17:54,090 --> 02:17:58,120
50,000 American lives, the military is smuggling narcotics.

1959
02:17:58,260 --> 02:18:00,889
That is how this event today will be interpreted.

1960
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:02,629
That someone employed by this office

1961
02:18:02,770 --> 02:18:06,469
Believes that the united states army is in the drug trafficking business

1962
02:18:06,610 --> 02:18:09,770
And is trying to prove it by desecrating the remains of young men

1963
02:18:09,909 --> 02:18:12,639
Who have given their lives in the defense of democracy!

1964
02:18:12,780 --> 02:18:15,299
There is dope on that plane. shut the fuck up!

1965
02:18:16,780 --> 02:18:19,909
Is it any wonder, then, because of your actions,

1966
02:18:20,290 --> 02:18:22,579
The entire federal narcotics program is now in jeopardy

1967
02:18:22,690 --> 02:18:25,659
Of being dismantled as completely and enthusiastically

1968
02:18:25,790 --> 02:18:27,590
As that fucking transport plane?

1969
02:18:27,690 --> 02:18:30,159
That is what you've accomplished, mr. roberts, single-handedly.

1970
02:18:30,299 --> 02:18:31,920
I had good information.

1971
02:18:32,469 --> 02:18:35,829
That the target of my investigation was bringing dope in on that plane.

1972
02:18:35,969 --> 02:18:37,899
And that target is? frank lucas.

1973
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:39,969
Who? his name's frank lucas.

1974
02:18:40,139 --> 02:18:42,610
Who is frank lucas? who does he work for? which family?

1975
02:18:42,709 --> 02:18:44,770
He's not italian. he's black.

1976
02:18:48,309 --> 02:18:50,680
Is that supposed to be some kind of a joke?

1977
02:18:51,319 --> 02:18:53,549
You're this close to the end of your career in law enforcement

1978
02:18:53,649 --> 02:18:55,520
And you're making fucking jokes?

1979
02:18:56,319 --> 02:18:58,450
My investigation indicates

1980
02:18:58,860 --> 02:19:01,790
That frank lucas is above the mafia in the dope business.

1981
02:19:02,299 --> 02:19:03,959
My investigations also indicate

1982
02:19:04,059 --> 02:19:08,090
That frank lucas buys direct from a source in southeast asia.

1983
02:19:08,200 --> 02:19:11,329
He cuts out the middlemen and uses us military planes

1984
02:19:11,469 --> 02:19:15,309
And personnel to transport pure #4 heroin into the united states

1985
02:19:15,409 --> 02:19:19,469
And he's been doing so on a regular basis since 1969.

1986
02:19:19,579 --> 02:19:22,479
I have cases against every member of frank's organization.

1987
02:19:22,579 --> 02:19:23,670
Frank's organization?

1988
02:19:23,819 --> 02:19:27,549
No fucking nigger has ever accomplished what the American mafia hasn't in 100 years

1989
02:19:27,690 --> 02:19:30,620
And you would know that how? why? 'cause your head is stuck up your fucking ass?

1990
02:19:30,719 --> 02:19:33,059
Hey, lou, do me a favor. will you get this fucking kike out of here?

1991
02:19:33,190 --> 02:19:34,659
Kike? kike?

1992
02:19:34,760 --> 02:19:35,819
Richie, no.

1993
02:19:39,370 --> 02:19:40,489
Hey, richie!

1994
02:19:41,930 --> 02:19:43,059
Make it stick.

1995
02:19:43,870 --> 02:19:46,340
Spearman's with the coffins. they're about a quarter mile away.

1996
02:20:17,600 --> 02:20:18,899
Doctor.

1997
02:20:20,739 --> 02:20:21,870
What?

1998
02:20:22,409 --> 02:20:25,379
Fucking trupo came by the house, man. it's bad.

1999
02:20:40,260 --> 02:20:43,290
Frankie, I need to speak with you a minute. please?

2000
02:20:43,430 --> 02:20:46,260
I got to go, ma. no, sit down just a minute.

2001
02:20:46,399 --> 02:20:48,959
Would you please come back a little later?

2002
02:20:49,100 --> 02:20:50,299
Thank you.

2003
02:20:50,440 --> 02:20:52,399
Ma, I got to go. all right? just a few words.

2004
02:20:52,510 --> 02:20:53,770
Listen to me. I got...

2005
02:20:53,909 --> 02:20:55,700
Please, sit down. just a few words.

2006
02:20:56,309 --> 02:20:57,899
I've been thinking about some things.

2007
02:20:58,010 --> 02:21:01,540
If you'd been a preacher, your brothers would have been preachers.

2008
02:21:01,649 --> 02:21:02,709
Right.

2009
02:21:02,819 --> 02:21:06,750
If you'd been a soldier, they'd be soldiers. you know that.

2010
02:21:06,850 --> 02:21:10,479
They came here because of you. you called and they came running.

2011
02:21:10,620 --> 02:21:11,610
Right.

2012
02:21:11,760 --> 02:21:15,159
That's because they look up to you.

2013
02:21:15,290 --> 02:21:19,090
They always expect you to know what's best.

2014
02:21:19,870 --> 02:21:21,829
But even they know

2015
02:21:22,129 --> 02:21:23,930
You don't shoot cops.

2016
02:21:26,010 --> 02:21:27,629
Even I know that.

2017
02:21:28,809 --> 02:21:30,280
Eva knows it. all right, ma.

2018
02:21:30,379 --> 02:21:32,870
The only one who doesn't seem to know is you!

2019
02:21:32,979 --> 02:21:36,110
All right, ma. I got to go. I promise you, I ain't gonna shoot nobody.

2020
02:21:36,219 --> 02:21:39,979
I never asked you where all this came from because I didn't want to hear you lie.

2021
02:21:40,120 --> 02:21:42,209
I didn't want you to worry about it. now, come on, I got to go.

2022
02:21:42,319 --> 02:21:43,790
Don't lie to me!

2023
02:21:48,329 --> 02:21:49,790
Don't do that.

2024
02:21:51,459 --> 02:21:54,799
Do you want to make things so bad

2025
02:21:54,899 --> 02:21:57,729
For your family that they'll leave you? because they will.

2026
02:21:57,840 --> 02:21:58,860
They'll understand.

2027
02:21:59,010 --> 02:22:01,299
She will leave you.

2028
02:22:01,409 --> 02:22:02,430
All right, mama.

2029
02:22:05,379 --> 02:22:07,010
I will leave you!

2030
02:22:34,370 --> 02:22:36,170
Got coffins on the move, richie.

2031
02:22:36,280 --> 02:22:39,399
We want the transport coffins, not the ceremonial ones.

2032
02:22:40,950 --> 02:22:42,409
Who are these guys?

2033
02:22:44,649 --> 02:22:46,079
What does it say?

2034
02:22:49,059 --> 02:22:51,620
Bayonne custodial services?

2035
02:22:51,719 --> 02:22:53,350
Bayonne cleaning services?

2036
02:22:53,459 --> 02:22:54,620
Bayonne? what the fuck is that?

2037
02:22:54,729 --> 02:22:56,190
Give me the camera, al.

2038
02:22:59,229 --> 02:23:00,360
Bingo.

2039
02:23:00,469 --> 02:23:03,229
Holy shit. that's the baseball kid.

2040
02:23:03,370 --> 02:23:05,360
Oh, yeah. that's stevie lucas.

2041
02:23:05,469 --> 02:23:08,030
So what you want to do, richie? follow the trucks?

2042
02:23:08,139 --> 02:23:10,270
No. no. I wanna stay here with the lucas kid.

2043
02:23:11,079 --> 02:23:12,700
We'll follow that van.

2044
02:23:13,079 --> 02:23:16,209
You guys better eat up. we're gonna have a long night.

2045
02:23:27,329 --> 02:23:29,190
Come on, more precious than gold, man.

2046
02:23:29,299 --> 02:23:30,850
This is more precious than gold.

2047
02:23:31,430 --> 02:23:33,899
We got a couple more. let's go. stack that up.

2048
02:23:34,930 --> 02:23:36,870
Take it. take it.

2049
02:23:36,969 --> 02:23:38,399
Give me a second, man, give me a second.

2050
02:23:40,610 --> 02:23:44,100
Hey. yo. we got four caskets left, man. let's make some fucking money in here.

2051
02:23:46,780 --> 02:23:47,909
What are they loading in there?

2052
02:23:48,010 --> 02:23:49,209
What the fuck are they loading in there?

2053
02:23:49,319 --> 02:23:50,409
That's the dope.

2054
02:23:50,520 --> 02:23:53,489
That's got to be the dope! it's got to be.

2055
02:23:54,120 --> 02:23:55,420
Let's go.

2056
02:23:56,290 --> 02:23:57,450
Let's move.

2057
02:24:50,309 --> 02:24:51,610
Lou, it's richie.

2058
02:24:51,879 --> 02:24:54,440
We got everybody in place. everybody.

2059
02:24:54,549 --> 02:24:55,639
Are you sure this is it?

2060
02:24:55,750 --> 02:24:57,270
I'm positive, man. okay?

2061
02:24:57,750 --> 02:24:59,379
All right, they're cutting and bagging

2062
02:24:59,520 --> 02:25:02,350
In the south tower of the stephen crane projects right now.

2063
02:25:02,659 --> 02:25:04,620
Are you sure this is it? you're positive?

2064
02:25:04,719 --> 02:25:07,489
I'm positive, lou. I'm positive. okay?

2065
02:25:07,590 --> 02:25:10,059
Everything is ready to go. all the guys are ready to go.

2066
02:25:10,200 --> 02:25:12,290
Just push the button, give me the warrant, okay?

2067
02:25:12,600 --> 02:25:14,190
Okay. you got it.

2068
02:25:21,909 --> 02:25:23,170
You all right?

2069
02:26:15,829 --> 02:26:17,389
Got the warrant. all right.

2070
02:26:21,500 --> 02:26:22,870
Let's go!

2071
02:26:39,750 --> 02:26:40,979
Move!

2072
02:26:44,190 --> 02:26:46,620
Hi, ma'am. what's your name? what's going on here?

2073
02:26:47,629 --> 02:26:49,620
Get down! get down, motherfucker!

2074

Go. okay. let's go, al!

2075
02:26:53,670 --> 02:26:55,100
Move it, come on.

2076
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:57,629
Come on, move it. move it!

2077
02:27:40,649 --> 02:27:41,770
All set.

2078
02:27:42,510 --> 02:27:43,670
Roger.

2079
02:27:45,350 --> 02:27:46,409
Get ready.

2080
02:27:46,649 --> 02:27:48,479
There you go! all right.

2081
02:27:50,319 --> 02:27:51,309
Come on.

2082
02:27:59,629 --> 02:28:00,690
At target.

2083
02:28:01,799 --> 02:28:03,770
Spearman, stand by.

2084
02:28:03,969 --> 02:28:06,370
I got civilians on the target floor.

2085
02:28:09,209 --> 02:28:10,870
What? oh...

2086
02:28:11,239 --> 02:28:12,680
Come on, there you go.

2087
02:28:13,010 --> 02:28:14,270
Hey, tim.

2088
02:28:14,579 --> 02:28:16,709
Girl, why don't you get some clothes on?

2089
02:28:21,389 --> 02:28:22,510
Let's go.

2090
02:28:29,229 --> 02:28:30,819
You think you bad, huh?

2091
02:28:35,069 --> 02:28:37,799
Hold on. where you going? where you going?

2092
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:39,229
Come on!

2093
02:28:41,040 --> 02:28:42,370
I'll get it!

2094
02:28:44,780 --> 02:28:46,040
Where's tim?

2095
02:28:47,049 --> 02:28:48,309
Quiet, kid!

2096
02:28:55,190 --> 02:28:57,209
I got some sandwiches for you boys, man.

2097
02:28:59,959 --> 02:29:01,389
But where's tim?

2098
02:29:01,690 --> 02:29:04,090
Shit. man, tim always playing around.

2099
02:29:05,629 --> 02:29:06,930
Hey, man!

2100
02:29:07,229 --> 02:29:09,170
You got some blue magic, baby?

2101
02:29:10,569 --> 02:29:11,930

02:29:20,909 --> 02:29:22,350

02:29:29,620 --> 02:29:31,420
Police! police!

Drop it! get out, get out!

2111
02:29:33,489 --> 02:29:34,579
Drop the gun! don't do it!

2112
02:29:34,729 --> 02:29:36,250
Drop the gun, drop it! don't do it.

2113
02:29:38,930 --> 02:29:40,129

2114
02:29:43,600 --> 02:29:45,129

Hey, man, what's going on?

2124
02:31:24,569 --> 02:31:26,059

Thank you very much. you're welcome.

2129
02:32:02,909 --> 02:32:05,399

2130
02:32:05,579 --> 02:32:09,840
∮That saved a wretch∮

Mrs. lucas, please step back inside. yes, officer.

2132
02:32:32,639 --> 02:32:34,069
Please, mother lucas, step inside, please.

Respectfully, ma'am, please step inside. thank you. step inside.

2134
02:32:48,850 --> 02:32:51,250

Oh, man.

Don't you owe me money? I'll get you some more. here you go.

2137
02:32:59,629 --> 02:33:01,719
Yo, yo! pigs! look out!

Nypd! everybody stand still!

2139

Turner! go!

2140
02:33:10,010 --> 02:33:12,100
Down on the ground, motherfucker!

2141
02:33:46,180 --> 02:33:50,809
...dead servicemen returning from defending our country in vietnam...

2142
02:33:53,350 --> 02:33:56,290
Over there. okay.

2143
02:34:01,860 --> 02:34:04,829
Ladies and gentlemen, at this stage of the proceedings

2144
02:34:04,930 --> 02:34:07,799
The counsels are ready for their opening statements.

2145
02:34:08,329 --> 02:34:11,360
For the prosecution, mr. roberts will proceed

2146
02:34:11,500 --> 02:34:13,799
With his opening statement first.

2147
02:34:14,270 --> 02:34:18,139
Mr. roberts, are you ready to proceed?

2148
02:34:19,750 --> 02:34:21,370
Yes, your honor.

2149
02:34:25,450 --> 02:34:28,010
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

2150
02:34:32,389 --> 02:34:35,829
The state will show and you will hear

2151
02:34:36,399 --> 02:34:39,260
That frank lucas is the most dangerous man

2152
02:34:40,329 --> 02:34:42,629
Walking the streets of our city.

2153
02:34:45,370 --> 02:34:49,270
All right, y'all, get on out. let me talk to mr. richie alone.

2154
02:34:52,379 --> 02:34:55,780
Come on, come on, come on. I pay y'all by the hour, not by the minute.

2155
02:34:58,579 --> 02:34:59,909
Thank you.

2156
02:35:04,559 --> 02:35:06,790
You ain't wearing a wire, are you?

2157
02:35:07,590 --> 02:35:08,620
No.

2158
02:35:09,799 --> 02:35:10,850
All right.

2159
02:35:10,959 --> 02:35:15,299
I was talking to my lawyers. they said something to me, I can't believe it.

2160
02:35:16,770 --> 02:35:19,969
Did you really find a million dollars in the trunk of a car

2161
02:35:20,110 --> 02:35:21,799
And then turn it in? did you do that? yeah.

2162
02:35:21,940 --> 02:35:23,309
You did that for real, huh?

2163
02:35:23,440 --> 02:35:26,639
My man. good for you. shit.

2164
02:35:26,780 --> 02:35:28,870
You know johnny law got, though, right?

2165
02:35:29,079 --> 02:35:31,069
About it, mr. richie.

2166
02:35:31,180 --> 02:35:33,409
You know he got it. you turned that money in,

2167
02:35:33,520 --> 02:35:36,040
He took it and you ain't get nothing for it. did you?

2168
02:35:36,149 --> 02:35:37,590
Why did you do that?

2169
02:35:37,989 --> 02:35:40,319
It was the right thing to do. that's true.

2170
02:35:40,760 --> 02:35:42,729
That's a good answer. it was the right thing to do.

2171
02:35:42,860 --> 02:35:45,059
The question I have, the question I've been asking myself is,

2172
02:35:45,159 --> 02:35:46,760
Would you do it again?

2173
02:35:48,030 --> 02:35:50,930
I mean, that's a lot of money, that's a long time ago.

2174
02:35:51,370 --> 02:35:54,899
Many car payments ago, many child support payments ago.

2175
02:35:56,680 --> 02:36:00,510
So I said to myself, the onlyest way to find out is to find out.

2176
02:36:02,049 --> 02:36:07,819
Bribery, extortion, murder, racketeering...

2177
02:36:09,790 --> 02:36:11,520
Now, you give me an address,

2178
02:36:11,659 --> 02:36:14,920
I'll make sure the car's there, I'll make sure that money's in that trunk.

2179
02:36:15,030 --> 02:36:16,430
No, thanks.

2180
02:36:16,799 --> 02:36:18,090
You sure?

2181
02:36:19,899 --> 02:36:22,799
Come on, now, richie. what do you think, that impresses me?

2182
02:36:23,000 --> 02:36:25,969
You think that you're better than them? you ain't no better than them other cops.

2183
02:36:26,069 --> 02:36:28,299
In fact, you're the same as them. you are them.

2184
02:36:29,040 --> 02:36:30,370
Let me ask you this.

2185
02:36:30,510 --> 02:36:33,639
Do you really think that putting me behind bars

2186
02:36:33,750 --> 02:36:35,649
Is going to change anything on them streets?

2187
02:36:35,750 --> 02:36:37,370
Them dope fiends is gonna shoot it,

2188
02:36:37,479 --> 02:36:39,610
They're gonna steal for it, they're gonna die for it.

2189
02:36:39,719 --> 02:36:42,479
Putting me in or out ain't gonna change one thing.

2190
02:36:42,850 --> 02:36:44,120
Then that's the way it is.

2191
02:36:44,219 --> 02:36:46,049
That's just the way it is. so what we got, richie?

2192
02:36:46,260 --> 02:36:48,020
We got me and you sitting here.

2193
02:36:48,329 --> 02:36:51,229
We got that little snitch-ass driver for my brother.

2194
02:36:51,329 --> 02:36:52,799
You got a little bit of powder.

2195
02:36:53,100 --> 02:36:54,959
You're going to need more than that, richie.

2196
02:36:55,229 --> 02:36:58,729
I got possession, supply, conspiracy,

2197
02:36:58,940 --> 02:37:03,030
Bribing a law officer. I got people who'll attest to seeing you kill in cold blood.

2198
02:37:03,180 --> 02:37:07,079
I got your offshore bank accounts, your real estate, your businesses,

2199
02:37:07,209 --> 02:37:09,680
All bought with money from heroin.

2200
02:37:10,020 --> 02:37:12,750
And I got hundreds of parents of dead kids.

2201
02:37:13,190 --> 02:37:15,680
Addicts who od'ed on your product. and that's my story for the jury.

2202
02:37:15,790 --> 02:37:19,350
And that's how I make it all stick. "this man murdered thousands of people.

2203
02:37:19,459 --> 02:37:21,430
"and he did it from a penthouse, driving a lincoln."

2204
02:37:21,559 --> 02:37:23,360
Aside from that, you got nothing to worry about.

2205
02:37:23,459 --> 02:37:26,329
That's pretty good. but that's why we go to court, isn't it, richie?

2206
02:37:26,430 --> 02:37:27,860
Cause I got witnesses, too.

2207
02:37:28,100 --> 02:37:32,059
I got celebrities. I got sports figures. I got harlem, richie.

2208
02:37:32,600 --> 02:37:36,399
I took care of harlem, so harlem's gonna take care of me. you can believe that.

2209
02:37:36,540 --> 02:37:39,010
I got more than that, frank. what you got?

2210
02:37:39,110 --> 02:37:41,770
I've got a line of people wanting to testify against you,

2211
02:37:41,909 --> 02:37:44,250
It stretches out the door and around the block.

2212
02:37:44,379 --> 02:37:48,180
You damaged a lot of lives, frank. I got the mazzano crime family.

2213
02:37:48,290 --> 02:37:49,879
Remember those boys? you put them out of business.

2214
02:37:49,989 --> 02:37:51,549
I ain't got nothing to do with no mazzanos.

2215
02:37:51,659 --> 02:37:52,709
Mazzanos ain't got nothing to do with me.

2216
02:37:52,819 --> 02:37:54,219
They got everything to do with you. what, they...

2217
02:37:54,329 --> 02:37:55,379
You know why? why?

2218
02:37:55,489 --> 02:37:58,049
Because apart from the fact that they hate you personally,

2219
02:37:58,559 --> 02:37:59,889
They hate what you represent.

2220
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:03,059
I don't represent nothing but frank lucas. you sure?

2221
02:38:03,469 --> 02:38:05,399
A black businessman like you?

2222
02:38:05,840 --> 02:38:07,360
You represent progress.

2223
02:38:08,110 --> 02:38:11,100
The kind of progress that's going to see them lose a lot of money.

2224
02:38:11,680 --> 02:38:15,239
With you out of the way, everything can return to normal.

2225
02:38:16,379 --> 02:38:17,610
My man.

2226
02:38:22,450 --> 02:38:24,450
You know what normal is to me, richie?

2227
02:38:24,760 --> 02:38:27,659
I ain't seen normal since I was six years old.

2228
02:38:29,290 --> 02:38:31,889
Normal is seeing the police right up to my house

2229
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:34,930
Dragging my little 12-year-old cousin out, tying him to a pole,

2230
02:38:35,030 --> 02:38:38,159
Shoving a shotgun in his mouth so hard they bust his teeth.

2231
02:38:38,299 --> 02:38:41,569
Then they bust two shotgun shells in his head and knock his fucking head off.

2232
02:38:41,670 --> 02:38:42,899
That's what normal is to me.

2233
02:38:43,010 --> 02:38:46,069
I didn't give a fuck about no police then.

2234
02:38:46,180 --> 02:38:49,149
I don't give a fuck about no police now. shit.

2235
02:38:49,510 --> 02:38:51,739
You know what, you can do whatever you want to do.

2236
02:38:51,879 --> 02:38:54,350
So, it don't mean nothing to me for you to show up tomorrow morning

2237
02:38:54,489 --> 02:38:56,950
With your head blown off. do you understand what I'm saying?

2238
02:38:57,489 --> 02:38:59,860
Yeah, frank. get in line.

2239
02:39:00,530 --> 02:39:02,760
That one stretches around the block, too.

2240
02:39:06,159 --> 02:39:07,500
All right.

2241
02:39:11,239 --> 02:39:12,670
What do you want to do?

2242
02:39:19,379 --> 02:39:21,040
You know what you got to do.

2243
02:39:21,209 --> 02:39:22,979
