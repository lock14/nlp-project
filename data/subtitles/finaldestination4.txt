If these guys lose focus

Of course it's to see a crash.

We can pay our respects to those people.



What people?



People who didn't have a Dr. Xavier with

People who didn't have one of these?



Go ahead, Janet. Kiss it.



It's your choice, heads or tails,

All that is known at this time

from the racetrack.



We just lost a really hot MILF.



-Dude, this is serious.
-Yeah.



Don't you think it's weird
that two of the people Nick saved are dead?



Weird is putting tampons in your kids' ears.
That's weird.



She was bound to die sooner or later.



That's actually why we asked you guys
to come over.



The night before it happened,
Nick had a really strange dream.



Great. I'm glad I cancelled my golf game
for this. Good.



NICK:
But it wasn't a dream.



It was like these random sounds
and images.



They really didn't make any sense.
And then I read what killed them...



...and I realized that I'd seen
how the next person was gonna die.



Wait, what do you mean,
"the next person"?



Okay, don't laugh,
but we stayed up Googling premonitions...



...visions, signs, things like that, just to see
how much information we could get.



NICK:
There are tons of articles about people...



...who had a premonition
about a disaster...



...they saved themselves...



...and then they died.



Okay, so people died. So what?



NICK:
Every survivor died.



In the precise order they were meant to die
in the accident.



Well, we survived.



So now does that mean we all die?



-Well, who's next?
-I don't remember.



But there might be an out.



Some say the chain can be broken.



Like if you were to intervene
into someone else's death...



...that would end it.



But others say
unless the chain is broken completely...



...then you're just changing the batting
order, and sooner or later, you're up.



That is some spooky psychobabble shit.



shut up, please. This is not funny.



-He could be watching a ton of TV.
-You know what this does to me.



It's okay. All we're trying to do
is figure out what's going on.

figure that out without me.



You can call me later, but I gotta go.
Hope you have fun.

Janet, come back. Don't leave.



JANET: No, Lori. No.
You guys are freaking me out.



What's with that?
She went from uptight but normal...



...to uptight and totally insane.



Why do you gotta be a prick?
She saw somebody die.



HUNT: So did we.
NICK: Yeah, and we're all freaked out.



Would it kill you to be sensitive?



HUNT:
I don't know.



I've never tried it.



Where are you going?



If you're right
about this whole crash thing...



...then I'm going to make the most
of every moment I have left.



so I'm gonna do what I do best:
I'm gonna go get laid.



If I'm dying, I'm trying.



Keep up the good fight, guys.



And if I happen to bump into Janet,
I will check on her.



Thanks.



(SIGHS)



Well, that went well.



Yeah, our friends think we're crazy.
It's great.



Well, maybe we are.



Look, they're probably
just some weird coincidences.



(SIGHS)



You think?



I hope so.



Nick? What did you see?



-l think we can stop it.
-How?



We gotta go to the racetrack.



LORI:
Oh, my God.



Look at this place.



All those people just...



-l don't wanna be here.
NICK: I know, I know.



But this is the only thing that I can think of
to help me remember the order.



It's over here. This is where we were.



Let's see if this works.



The mechanic's girlfriend dies first.



(GASPING)



Then that racist and his wife.



(CROWD SCREAMING)



That woman with the kids, she was next.



Let's go. We shouldn't be here. Let's go.



I can't remember who dies when.



-It's okay.
-I don't know what to do. I can't--



Maybe this was a really bad idea.



No.



I gotta try.



You better have a damn good reason
for trespassing.



NICK:
I just need to remember the order.



GEORGE: Young man, that sounds crazy.
But maybe this will help you.



Now, this will bring up
all our video cameras right here.



There.



That's where that guy
in the mechanic jacket dies.



-so he's next, then.
NICK: I think so.



That collapse kills Hunt and Janet.



And that's when you die.



And then Lori.



Then me.



Maybe if we can stop this mechanic from
getting killed, we can break the chain...



...and the rest of us will be safe.



But how?
I mean, we don't even know his name.



-We know nothing about him.
NICK: But we do know where he works.

I don't understand
how George can be so calm about things.



-Maybe he was in shock.
-No, that's not it.



It was very clear. It's...
It's like he just accepted it.



I think he's given up.



If he dies, I'm next.



And when that happens,
maybe you should just keep your distance.



Babe, what are you talking about?
Come on.



I don't want anything to happen to you.



And if we're together, it makes it easier
for death to take both of us.



I don't care what happens.
We are in this together.



(WIND WHISTLING)



LORI:
Look.



Maybe no one else has to die.



We should go tell George.



(KNOCKING ON DOOR)



NICK:
Hello?



George.



We think saving Janet broke the chain.



George?



(CLUNKING NEARBY)



-George?
-George?



(GEORGE CHOKING)



LORI:
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. No. George--



Oh, my God. Are you crazy?
After everything that we've been through.



Why are you trying to kill yourself?



Trying to give God
what I thought he wanted.



I've been trying to kill myself all day.



Took a bottle of painkillers.
I just threw them up.



Then I went to the garage,
hooked a hose from the tailpipe...



...stuck it inside the car,
the car kept stalling.



(COUGHING)



Then...



So wait.



Saving Janet
must have destroyed the list, then.



GEORGE:
I think congratulations are in order.



NICK:
To breaking the chain.



GEORGE: Apple cider?
-Thank you.



-Thank God.
-And a toast.



NICK:
Mm-hm.



-To life.
-To life.



-To life.
GEORGE: Yes.



Mm...



We've been given a second chance.
So, what are you guys gonna do with it?



LORI: I have a few plans for us, ha, ha.
NICK: Uh, oh-oh.



Lots of travelling, like Paris,
maybe some beaches, St.-Tropez.



I'm just thankful we have our whole lives
ahead of us, you know?



Yeah.



Now this is over,
I'm not gonna take another day for granted.



Ever.



You know, maybe it's time to stop talking
about doing stuff and actually start doing it.



-You only live once, right?
-That's what I'm talking about.



Let me get the cookies.



(GEORGE CHUCKLING)



We made it.



We did.



(CELL PHONE RINGS)



-Hey.
-Hey, babe.



NICK: Did you get the traveller's checks?
-Yes, I did.



(OVER PHONE)
Need anything from the mall?



No, I think we're good.



You sure you don't wanna come
to the movie?



-It's in 3-D.
-Love Lays Dying?



Yeah, I think I'll be all right.
Sounds like a chickflick.



But, uh, I'll have everything packed
by the time you get home.



(OVER PHONE)
Amsterdam, here we come.



I can't believe we're actually going.
Um, heh--



You know, Janet is so incredibly jealous.



speaking of, she's walking up right now.
I'm gonna run, okay?



-Tell her I said hi.
JANET: I will.



-Love you.
-Love you too. Be home soon.



NICK: (OVER PHONE) Bye.
-Bye.



-Hi.
-Hi, ha, ha.

Jonathan Groves was rescued

George, how fast can you meet me
at the hospital?



Look, man, we got the order wrong.



Remember that guy who sat in front of me?
The cowboy?



He didn't die, which means he's next.
Look, just be there in five. I'm on my way.



(EKG BEEPING)



You feeling okay, Mr. Suby?



Ha. Why do you care?



You know how many of your kind
I killed in Korea?



-I'm Chinese, sir.

I need you in PT 3 right now.

Where's Lori?



I've been calling and texting all afternoon.
She's not picking up.



Maybe it won't matter. Come on.



(GRUNTING)



(GROANS)



How can there be someone else on the list?
He didn't leave the racetrack with us.



If I would've asked him to move
like in the premonition, he would've died.



He survived.
That's why you couldn't kill yourself.



You weren't next, he was.
It wasn't destined at all.



So if he dies, I'm next again.



Great, man.



-Excuse me.
WOMAN: (ON PA) Dr. Taylor to Pathology.



Dr. Sheila Taylor to Pathology.

That's genius. Someone could get killed.



(JANET CLEARS THROAT)



-Man, I'm feeling something.
-Don't lose hope, man.



If we keep an eye out for signs of danger,
I think we got a shot.



-Let's just go find Lori and Janet.
-No, no, not that. I mean, it's like dejà vu.



My wife said that dejà vu
is like God's way of--

Ah...



Well, they're cute yet functional.



I like them.



They say, "I'm getting older,
but I still like to party." Ha, ha.



Ha, ha, I didn't buy them for you,
I bought them for Nick.



He likes me in sneaks.



MAN #1:
Yeah, just get a 2-by-48.



MAN #2:
Right off the corner brace?



Check the measurement. It's not fitting.



Those windows won't pass.



(WHIRRING)



Yeah, 90 on that.



Yeah, that looks fine.



Go ahead and nail it off, it's level.



(CLICKING)



Yeah, around the corner.

-Don't freak out.
-Pull my leg harder.



Help me try to get it out.
It's not coming loose.

Um, what the hell is that?



A giant chococcino with whipped cream,
chocolate syrup, caramel and sprinkles.



That looks disgusting.



Yeah. I'm going into a diabetic coma
just looking at it.



Well, what can I say, ladies?
It looked good.



Yeah, but it tastes totally disgusting.

who stopped that mall fire, aren't you?



You saved a lot of lives, man.



I was just at the right place

There's a grocery store and a card shop'
