1
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:38,064
I kind of have two moons
in my head, I guess,

2
00:01:38,169 --> 00:01:40,194
whereas most people
just have one moon.

3
00:01:44,242 --> 00:01:48,269
I look at the Moon just like everybody else
who's never been there

4
00:01:48,378 --> 00:01:52,314
and, you know, there it is and
I've always thought it was interesting...

5
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:56,216
Whether it's full or a sliver,
or what have you.

6
00:01:57,421 --> 00:01:59,685
But every once in a while,
I do think of a second moon,

7
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,951
you know, the one that
I recall from up close

8
00:02:02,059 --> 00:02:06,291
and, yeah, it is kind of hard to believe
that I was actually up there.

9
00:02:10,032 --> 00:02:11,499
I want to promise you, I'm human.

10
00:02:11,601 --> 00:02:15,765
I pinched myself to find out
whether it was really happening.

11
00:02:20,676 --> 00:02:25,170
I called the Moon my home
for three days of my life

12
00:02:25,281 --> 00:02:27,044
and I'm here to tell you about it.

13
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,777
That's science fiction.

14
00:02:34,122 --> 00:02:37,489
My father was born shortly
after the Wright brothers.

15
00:02:42,364 --> 00:02:47,597
He could barely believe
that I went to the Moon.

16
00:02:50,372 --> 00:02:53,603
But my son, Tom, was five.

17
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:56,302
And he didn't think
it was any big deal.

18
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:25,061
Lift-off, we have a lift-off.

19
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:27,571
32 minutes past the hour.

20
00:03:54,766 --> 00:03:56,563
The tower is clear.

21
00:04:21,325 --> 00:04:22,883
<i># Woke up this morning #</i>

22
00:04:22,994 --> 00:04:24,825
<i># With light in my eyes... #</i>

23
00:04:24,929 --> 00:04:27,090
One day, under secret orders,

24
00:04:27,197 --> 00:04:29,893
a group of us at the Test Pilot Center

25
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,401
were ordered to go to Washington
to get a briefing.

26
00:04:35,472 --> 00:04:38,669
And they talked about the Atlas booster

27
00:04:38,775 --> 00:04:43,337
and putting a capsule on top of that
with a man in it,

28
00:04:43,446 --> 00:04:47,314
Uh, to... To try to put a man into space.

29
00:04:47,417 --> 00:04:49,180
And of course, at that time,

30
00:04:49,286 --> 00:04:54,553
the Atlas boosters were blowing up
every other day down at Cape Canaveral.

31
00:04:56,692 --> 00:05:00,492
<i># Hey Mr. Spaceman #</i>

32
00:05:00,596 --> 00:05:02,928
<i># Won't you please take me along #</i>

33
00:05:03,032 --> 00:05:06,229
<i># I won't do anything wrong #</i>

34
00:05:06,335 --> 00:05:10,499
And it looked like a very, you know,
quick way to have a short career.

35
00:05:10,606 --> 00:05:12,938
<i># ...Take me along for a ride #</i>

36
00:05:14,876 --> 00:05:16,468
<i># Woke up this morning #</i>

37
00:05:16,577 --> 00:05:18,875
<i># I was feeling quite weird #</i>

38
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,572
<i># I had flies in my beard #</i>

39
00:05:20,682 --> 00:05:23,276
<i># My toothpaste was smeared #</i>

40
00:05:23,384 --> 00:05:27,445
<i># Over my window
they'd written my name #</i>

41
00:05:27,555 --> 00:05:30,718
<i># Said, "So long,
we'll see you again" #</i>

42
00:05:32,327 --> 00:05:36,161
<i># Hey Mr. Spaceman #</i>

43
00:05:36,263 --> 00:05:38,527
<i># Won't you please take me along #</i>

44
00:05:38,632 --> 00:05:40,964
<i># I won't do anything wrong #</i>

45
00:05:41,068 --> 00:05:45,027
<i># Hey Mr. Spaceman #</i>

46
00:05:45,138 --> 00:05:49,438
<i># Won't you please take #
me along for a ride</i>

47
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:10,120
Now it is time
to take longer strides,

48
00:06:10,229 --> 00:06:13,687
time for a great new
American enterprise,

49
00:06:13,799 --> 00:06:18,031
time for this nation
to take a clearly leading role

50
00:06:18,137 --> 00:06:19,866
in space achievement.

51
00:06:19,972 --> 00:06:23,373
Politically, it was about
beating the Russians,

52
00:06:23,475 --> 00:06:25,909
but those of us with a science bent

53
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,911
or a curious bent,
knew it was more than that.

54
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:32,073
I believe that this nation
should commit itself

55
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:36,620
to achieving the goal,
before this decade is out,

56
00:06:36,721 --> 00:06:40,452
of landing a man on the Moon
and returning him safely to the Earth.

57
00:06:40,558 --> 00:06:42,992
It was beautiful in its simplicity.

58
00:06:43,094 --> 00:06:44,994
Do what? Moon!

59
00:06:45,095 --> 00:06:46,756
When? End of decade!

60
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:48,092
He challenged us to do

61
00:06:48,198 --> 00:06:51,656
what I think most people
thought was impossible, including me.

62
00:06:51,769 --> 00:06:57,139
We go into space because whatever
Mankind must undertake,

63
00:06:57,241 --> 00:06:59,607
free men must fully share.

64
00:07:02,045 --> 00:07:03,910
But in a very real sense,

65
00:07:04,014 --> 00:07:07,279
it will not be one man
going to the Moon.

66
00:07:07,383 --> 00:07:09,613
We make this judgment affirmatively;

67
00:07:09,719 --> 00:07:12,051
It will be an entire nation.

68
00:07:12,155 --> 00:07:15,147
For all of us must work to put him there.

69
00:07:35,877 --> 00:07:39,745
I did the usual thing
of making model airplanes.

70
00:07:39,848 --> 00:07:42,510
Most of them,
little balsawood contraptions.

71
00:07:42,617 --> 00:07:47,213
Some of them actually flew
and I liked that.

72
00:07:47,322 --> 00:07:52,191
So I'd been interested
in mechanical objects in the sky,

73
00:07:52,293 --> 00:07:55,057
I guess, from as long
as I could remember.

74
00:08:02,169 --> 00:08:05,866
I was always awed by flight.

75
00:08:05,973 --> 00:08:08,271
When I was a young lad,

76
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:12,505
a barnstormer flying
a World War I airplane

77
00:08:12,613 --> 00:08:20,884
landed on our farm and Dad
helped him refuel and I got a ride,

78
00:08:20,987 --> 00:08:26,015
and he took me for a circle of the field
and that was my first airplane ride,

79
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:27,490
at about four years of age.

80
00:08:28,728 --> 00:08:30,923
The Mustangs dropped their wing tanks

81
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:33,021
and plunged into the fight.

82
00:08:33,132 --> 00:08:36,533
Maybe it was the movies,
maybe it was the real life news,

83
00:08:36,636 --> 00:08:40,732
but I knew that someday, sometime,

84
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:42,864
that's what I wanted to do.

85
00:08:44,243 --> 00:08:47,576
I knew I wanted to fly airplanes.

86
00:08:49,147 --> 00:08:54,608
In '61, I had just graduated
from the Test Pilot School

87
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,817
and I had a job flying fighters
in fighter tests at Edwards.

88
00:08:59,925 --> 00:09:01,984
At the Flight Test Center

89
00:09:02,093 --> 00:09:04,061
is the fastest school in the world:

90
00:09:04,161 --> 00:09:07,494
The United States Air Force
Flight Test School,

91
00:09:07,598 --> 00:09:10,158
from whose doors upon graduation

92
00:09:10,268 --> 00:09:12,463
come the men destined to push back

93
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:15,004
the frontiers
of aeronautical knowledge.

94
00:09:31,187 --> 00:09:33,246
Test pilot experience was critical.

95
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:38,187
It was a profession with
a lot of esprit de corps

96
00:09:38,295 --> 00:09:41,958
and a lot of danger
and a pioneering spirit.

97
00:10:02,918 --> 00:10:06,649
And when you're at
supersonic speeds and high altitudes,

98
00:10:06,755 --> 00:10:10,191
learning to survive that and bring your
machine back down,

99
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:15,957
it's the fundamental task
and the higher and faster you flew,

100
00:10:16,064 --> 00:10:18,498
the more dangerous
and more exciting it became.

101
00:10:27,809 --> 00:10:30,175
I thought I had the
best job in the world

102
00:10:30,278 --> 00:10:33,611
from the day I entered flight training
until I looked on TV

103
00:10:33,714 --> 00:10:36,376
one day and Al Shepherd
goes up in a rocket.

104
00:10:36,483 --> 00:10:38,917
The rocket performs perfectly!

105
00:10:39,019 --> 00:10:43,046
He's gone higher than I've ever gone
and faster than I've ever gone

106
00:10:43,156 --> 00:10:45,624
and most important,
he's made more noise doing it.

107
00:10:45,726 --> 00:10:47,523
He's even on TV doing it!

108
00:10:47,628 --> 00:10:50,620
How do I...
How do I get that job?

109
00:10:54,201 --> 00:10:56,362
"I've Got A Secret!"

110
00:10:56,469 --> 00:10:58,164
Brought to you tonight by...

111
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:00,636
Dream Whip!

112
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,674
The light, delicious topping

113
00:11:02,775 --> 00:11:05,710
that won't wilt on your desserts.

114
00:11:05,811 --> 00:11:07,244
Dream Whip!

115
00:11:07,346 --> 00:11:10,577
Now, if you'll whisper
your secret to me, Mr. And Mrs. Armstrong,

116
00:11:10,683 --> 00:11:12,514
We'll show it at the same time
to our audience at home.

117
00:11:12,618 --> 00:11:13,812
If you'll both lean in and whisper.

118
00:11:18,823 --> 00:11:23,021
Everybody put their application
in to every NASA request.

119
00:11:23,128 --> 00:11:26,222
I mean, it was just,
sort of a peer kind of thing.

120
00:11:26,331 --> 00:11:31,667
So NASA put out a request
for a third group of astronauts in early '63,

121
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:37,003
and of course everybody in my test
pilot class put their application in

122
00:11:37,108 --> 00:11:39,702
because it was another opportunity
for a new challenge.

123
00:11:39,811 --> 00:11:44,839
It certainly sounded very challenging
and something that if...

124
00:11:44,948 --> 00:11:48,076
if other people wanted to be
a part of this

125
00:11:48,185 --> 00:11:53,122
and this was a noble national effort,
why, I wanted to be a part of it.

126
00:11:53,223 --> 00:11:55,384
Now how would you feel,
Mrs. Armstrong,

127
00:11:55,491 --> 00:11:57,322
If it turned out...
Of course, nobody knows;

128
00:11:57,428 --> 00:12:00,886
But if it turns out that your son
is first man to land on the Moon,

129
00:12:00,998 --> 00:12:02,932
What... How would you feel?

130
00:12:05,301 --> 00:12:07,633
Well, I guess I'd just say God bless him

131
00:12:07,737 --> 00:12:11,468
and I wish him the best of all good luck.

132
00:12:11,574 --> 00:12:12,666
I'll bet you.

133
00:12:25,321 --> 00:12:29,257
That group of astronauts
was far and away the best group

134
00:12:29,357 --> 00:12:31,416
I had ever been associated with.

135
00:12:32,928 --> 00:12:35,522
There weren't any really weak sisters
in the bunch.

136
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:40,124
They were just an amazingly competent,
hardworking,

137
00:12:40,235 --> 00:12:43,136
really good bunch of people.

138
00:12:43,238 --> 00:12:47,971
One day... you're just Gene Cernan,

139
00:12:48,076 --> 00:12:49,873
young naval aviator, whatever,

140
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:52,309
and the next day,
you're an American hero.

141
00:12:52,413 --> 00:12:55,439
Literally.
And you have done nothing.

142
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:59,953
When Tom Wolfe
wrote "The Right Stuff",

143
00:13:00,054 --> 00:13:02,147
I thought,
"Boy! That sounds good.

144
00:13:02,256 --> 00:13:04,690
People are going to think
I have the right stuff!

145
00:13:04,792 --> 00:13:09,627
I'm the same guy I always was,
but now, I've got the right stuff!"

146
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:14,064
It's sort of an unshakeable belief
in your own infallibility.

147
00:13:14,167 --> 00:13:16,294
That's what the right stuff is.

148
00:13:16,402 --> 00:13:17,562
That you're immortal,

149
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:20,605
that you can do anything
that is thrown at you.

150
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,511
Nobody knew really
how to go to the Moon,

151
00:13:34,621 --> 00:13:36,748
there was a lot on paper.

152
00:13:36,855 --> 00:13:41,155
And we didn't know how to do things
and we didn't know how things would work.

153
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:43,922
It was just a matter of
putting them together,

154
00:13:44,029 --> 00:13:46,259
making them work
and then correcting deficiencies.

155
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:49,634
And as pilots, astronauts,

156
00:13:49,735 --> 00:13:51,896
why, we participated
in all of these things,

157
00:13:52,004 --> 00:13:54,871
along with management
and the engineers.

158
00:13:56,775 --> 00:13:58,538
What we did in the early days

159
00:13:58,643 --> 00:14:01,669
was take the overall spacecraft

160
00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:03,610
and divide it up like a pie.

161
00:14:03,714 --> 00:14:08,413
We sliced that pie up
into 10 or 15 different pieces

162
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:12,046
and we handed each slice
to one of the astronauts

163
00:14:12,156 --> 00:14:15,751
and said, "This is yours,
we want you to learn that slice."

164
00:14:20,298 --> 00:14:22,664
We shall send to the Moon,

165
00:14:22,766 --> 00:14:27,260
240,000 miles away,

166
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:29,099
a giant rocket

167
00:14:29,206 --> 00:14:32,437
more than 300 feet tall,

168
00:14:32,542 --> 00:14:35,033
made of new metal alloys,

169
00:14:35,145 --> 00:14:39,206
some of which have
not yet been invented,

170
00:14:39,316 --> 00:14:41,147
fitted together with a precision

171
00:14:41,251 --> 00:14:45,153
better than the finest watch,

172
00:14:45,254 --> 00:14:47,654
on an untried mission

173
00:14:47,756 --> 00:14:50,224
to an unknown celestial body,

174
00:14:50,326 --> 00:14:54,490
and then return it safely to Earth,

175
00:14:54,597 --> 00:14:56,326
re-entering the atmosphere

176
00:14:56,432 --> 00:14:59,868
at speeds of over
25,000 miles per hour,

177
00:14:59,969 --> 00:15:03,496
causing heat about half that
of the temperature of the Sun,

178
00:15:03,606 --> 00:15:05,733
Almost as hot as it is here today.

179
00:15:05,841 --> 00:15:08,605
And do all this...
And do all this

180
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:11,270
and do it right and do it first,

181
00:15:11,379 --> 00:15:13,404
before this decade is out,

182
00:15:13,513 --> 00:15:15,504
then we must be bold.

183
00:15:17,485 --> 00:15:19,316
I look back at Kennedy,

184
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,752
was he a visionary,
was he a dreamer,

185
00:15:21,856 --> 00:15:24,154
was he politically astute?

186
00:15:24,259 --> 00:15:25,817
The chances are, yes,

187
00:15:25,927 --> 00:15:27,827
he was probably...
probably all three.

188
00:15:27,929 --> 00:15:29,419
We'll never know.

189
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:40,201
Nor will we ever know
whether he really fully appreciated

190
00:15:40,307 --> 00:15:45,040
The challenge that he had laid down
in front of... the American people.

191
00:15:47,114 --> 00:15:49,776
And therefore, as we set sail,

192
00:15:49,883 --> 00:15:51,714
we ask God's blessing

193
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:56,117
on the most hazardous and dangerous
and greatest adventure

194
00:15:56,222 --> 00:15:58,349
on which man has ever embarked.

195
00:16:21,646 --> 00:16:23,443
Things were moving very quickly

196
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:27,781
and I was assigned as a back-up crew
to the first Apollo mission.

197
00:16:29,454 --> 00:16:32,514
Things were in sort of a turmoil,
there were a lot of problems,

198
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:36,560
and Gus Grissom was
doing the best he could,

199
00:16:36,661 --> 00:16:39,960
with his crew of Ed White and Roger Chaffee,
to straighten them out,

200
00:16:40,064 --> 00:16:44,398
try to get the spacecraft
ready to fly.

201
00:16:47,237 --> 00:16:50,832
We were incredibly intelligent

202
00:16:50,941 --> 00:16:54,672
about some of
the hazards that we faced.

203
00:16:54,778 --> 00:16:57,508
And we thought long
and hard about them

204
00:16:57,614 --> 00:17:00,913
and we did everything we could
to ward them off,

205
00:17:01,017 --> 00:17:07,013
but the business of 100% oxygen environment
inside the spacecraft,

206
00:17:07,123 --> 00:17:09,114
we really had not thought that through.

207
00:17:13,696 --> 00:17:17,132
And the wires were really bad in there.

208
00:17:17,233 --> 00:17:20,259
I'd asked Gus, I said,

209
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:21,997
"Gus, why don't you say something
about this wiring?"

210
00:17:22,105 --> 00:17:24,938
I said, "It's really terrible,
they ought to do something about this wiring,

211
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,440
it's really bad."
and he said, "I don't..."

212
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:30,101
And he said, "I can't say anything about it
or they'll fire me."

213
00:17:31,246 --> 00:17:34,238
That's what he told me.
I couldn't believe it.

214
00:17:37,953 --> 00:17:41,480
The crew were conducting
this test on the ground,

215
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:43,683
they weren't going to fly.

216
00:17:43,792 --> 00:17:47,387
I guess we, and I think of all of us
in the NASA family,

217
00:17:47,495 --> 00:17:49,019
never gave it a second thought.

218
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:52,463
what would happen if you got a spark

219
00:17:52,566 --> 00:17:58,232
in a 16 psi,
100% oxygen environment?

220
00:18:08,815 --> 00:18:10,680
I picked up the phone

221
00:18:10,784 --> 00:18:14,151
and they said... "Who's this?"

222
00:18:14,254 --> 00:18:15,414
I told them Alan Bean,

223
00:18:15,522 --> 00:18:19,117
he said, "Well, we're down here,
we're doing this test

224
00:18:19,225 --> 00:18:22,126
and we've lost the crew."

225
00:18:22,228 --> 00:18:25,356
And I said...

226
00:18:25,465 --> 00:18:29,094
"Where'd they go?
You've lost them?"

227
00:18:29,202 --> 00:18:32,535
Because I thought
they just needed to run the test

228
00:18:32,638 --> 00:18:34,299
and they can't find them.

229
00:18:34,406 --> 00:18:37,773
"No" they said,
"We've lost the crew."

230
00:18:37,876 --> 00:18:41,277
I said, "Maybe they're
down at the beach house."

231
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:44,713
And they said,
"No, there was a fire."

232
00:18:44,817 --> 00:18:49,049
And then it dawns on me
that maybe they're talking about

233
00:18:49,154 --> 00:18:51,281
something different than I think.

234
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:53,381
We interrupt our regular programming

235
00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:55,254
to bring you this special report.

236
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:58,157
Here's ABC's science editor,
Jules Bergman.

237
00:19:00,465 --> 00:19:03,662
Top space agency officials
are flying to Cape Kennedy tonight

238
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:07,260
to begin the official investigation
into what caused the flash fire

239
00:19:07,371 --> 00:19:11,239
that killed the nation's
first three Apollo astronauts earlier tonight.

240
00:19:12,677 --> 00:19:17,080
They died at t-minus ten minutes
into a simulated launch countdown,

241
00:19:17,181 --> 00:19:19,672
helplessly trapped inside their spacecraft.

242
00:19:35,732 --> 00:19:37,427
The accident occurred in January,

243
00:19:37,534 --> 00:19:39,502
the end of January 27th.

244
00:19:39,603 --> 00:19:42,128
And we're burying
our guys at Arlington

245
00:19:42,238 --> 00:19:45,469
and I wasn't sure whether we were
burying the entire Apollo program

246
00:19:45,574 --> 00:19:48,168
or three... of our buddies.

247
00:20:06,161 --> 00:20:08,254
That was the period, the late '60s,

248
00:20:08,363 --> 00:20:10,558
when we were fighting in Vietnam

249
00:20:10,665 --> 00:20:14,533
and when a lot of racial
issues were going around.

250
00:20:18,706 --> 00:20:20,537
I was not really in tune

251
00:20:20,642 --> 00:20:22,974
with what was going
on in the country.

252
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:29,045
Our whole culture was changing
markedly in this period.

253
00:20:37,124 --> 00:20:38,648
The Civil Rights Movement,

254
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:40,158
the Women's Movement,

255
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:44,060
the whole movement
toward a greater openness of society.

256
00:20:47,501 --> 00:20:52,598
I think we were very aware
of the situation in Vietnam

257
00:20:52,705 --> 00:20:59,474
because a lot of our friends
were flying airplanes in combat in Vietnam.

258
00:21:01,013 --> 00:21:03,880
And there would we have been,

259
00:21:03,983 --> 00:21:05,848
had we not been in
the space program.

260
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:14,184
I guess I can sort of admit it now,

261
00:21:14,292 --> 00:21:16,556
I've admitted it a little
bit to a few friends.

262
00:21:16,661 --> 00:21:20,062
That... I've always had a guilt complex
to some degree.

263
00:21:24,869 --> 00:21:28,032
That was my war, good or bad.

264
00:21:28,139 --> 00:21:30,073
Whether it was a good war
or a bad war,

265
00:21:30,175 --> 00:21:34,009
we're not discussing that,
but that was my war, to fight for my country,

266
00:21:34,112 --> 00:21:38,446
and my buddies were getting shot at
and shot down

267
00:21:38,549 --> 00:21:39,982
and in some cases captured.

268
00:21:40,084 --> 00:21:44,111
And I was getting my picture
on the front page of the paper.

269
00:21:46,257 --> 00:21:51,160
And I've always felt
that they fought my war for me.

270
00:21:52,563 --> 00:21:55,327
They look at it totally different.

271
00:21:55,432 --> 00:21:57,093
They said, "You were
doing something

272
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,567
that this country needed
more than anything else at the time.

273
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:01,864
You were part of a program,

274
00:22:01,971 --> 00:22:05,839
the only thing we had
to hold our head high and be proud of."

275
00:22:16,686 --> 00:22:19,416
1968, in this country,

276
00:22:19,522 --> 00:22:21,752
was a disastrous year.

277
00:22:24,526 --> 00:22:26,858
We had several assassinations,

278
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:29,888
Uh, not too good...

279
00:22:31,366 --> 00:22:34,631
So we needed something
really to cap it up that was positive,

280
00:22:34,736 --> 00:22:38,172
to give the American people
a sense of... of accomplishment

281
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:40,104
or at least satisfaction
of something.

282
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:45,208
If you were a scriptwriter
for the movies,

283
00:22:45,313 --> 00:22:49,374
you couldn't have picked
a better scenario than Apollo 8!

284
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:57,858
We hear from the CIA

285
00:22:57,958 --> 00:23:00,586
that the Russians
are going to send a spacecraft

286
00:23:00,695 --> 00:23:04,927
around the Moon with a person in it
and upstage us.

287
00:23:05,032 --> 00:23:08,559
If they orbit the Moon
before we land on the Moon,

288
00:23:08,668 --> 00:23:11,262
then they've gotten there first.

289
00:23:14,674 --> 00:23:16,835
We changed our plans on Apollo 8.

290
00:23:16,943 --> 00:23:20,640
They changed the mission
from an Earth orbital type

291
00:23:20,747 --> 00:23:22,942
to a flight to the Moon.

292
00:23:24,684 --> 00:23:29,849
And it was a bold move,
it had some risky aspects to it,

293
00:23:29,955 --> 00:23:33,391
but it was a time when
we made bold moves.

294
00:23:33,492 --> 00:23:35,460
The engines are off.

295
00:23:35,561 --> 00:23:39,998
Four, three, two, one, zero.

296
00:23:40,099 --> 00:23:42,124
We have commenced...

297
00:24:10,328 --> 00:24:11,386
Apollo 8, Houston.

298
00:24:11,496 --> 00:24:14,056
Your trajectory and
guidance are go, over.

299
00:24:14,165 --> 00:24:15,598
Thank you, Michael.

300
00:24:15,699 --> 00:24:17,496
Yeah, you're looking real good...

301
00:24:18,568 --> 00:24:20,763
It wasn't until we rolled over

302
00:24:20,871 --> 00:24:23,032
that we actually saw the Moon
for the first time.

303
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:25,836
We were just 60 miles
above the craters,

304
00:24:25,942 --> 00:24:28,103
and, you know...

305
00:24:28,211 --> 00:24:30,839
we were sort of like three school kids
looking in a candy store window,

306
00:24:30,947 --> 00:24:34,678
and we forgot the flight plan,
here we are, just 60 miles away.

307
00:24:37,887 --> 00:24:40,014
Oh my God,
look at that picture over there!

308
00:24:40,122 --> 00:24:41,089
Wow, is that pretty!

309
00:24:42,258 --> 00:24:44,954
You got a colour film, Jim?

310
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,618
Hand me a roll of colour, quick.

311
00:24:49,999 --> 00:24:52,024
Just grab me a colour.

312
00:24:52,134 --> 00:24:53,601
A colour exterior.

313
00:24:55,503 --> 00:24:57,471
We took photographs
as much as we could

314
00:24:57,573 --> 00:25:00,167
and, of course,
we took the photograph

315
00:25:00,275 --> 00:25:03,267
of the famous
Earth rise around the Moon

316
00:25:03,378 --> 00:25:08,111
and I have to credit Bill Anders
for taking the picture.

317
00:25:08,216 --> 00:25:10,878
Uh, he claims it
all the time, anyway!

318
00:25:11,953 --> 00:25:13,818
Calm down, Lovell!

319
00:25:13,922 --> 00:25:15,014
Well, I got it right...

320
00:25:15,123 --> 00:25:16,852
Oh, it's a beautiful shot!

321
00:25:19,127 --> 00:25:21,027
And of course, Christmas Eve,

322
00:25:21,129 --> 00:25:22,824
being around the Moon
on Christmas Eve,

323
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:27,333
we thought this would be
a very auspicious time to say something.

324
00:25:27,434 --> 00:25:31,097
The three of us selected to read
from the Old Testament,

325
00:25:31,205 --> 00:25:35,164
and we had it in fireproof paper
in the back of our flight manual.

326
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,507
"In the beginning,

327
00:25:41,615 --> 00:25:45,244
God created the Heaven
and the Earth

328
00:25:45,352 --> 00:25:49,152
and the Earth was
without form and void.

329
00:25:49,255 --> 00:25:52,156
And darkness was upon
the face of the deep.

330
00:25:54,927 --> 00:26:00,024
And the Spirit of God
moved upon the face of the waters

331
00:26:00,132 --> 00:26:03,397
and God said,
'let there be light'.

332
00:26:07,006 --> 00:26:09,167
And there was light."

333
00:26:14,312 --> 00:26:16,280
I thought it was a very nice touch,

334
00:26:16,381 --> 00:26:21,182
it fit very nicely into getting away
from all this machinery,

335
00:26:21,286 --> 00:26:24,050
and let's get down into,
sort of, the fundamentals

336
00:26:24,155 --> 00:26:27,283
of what makes all this happen,
why are we here.

337
00:26:27,392 --> 00:26:28,484
I liked it.

338
00:26:30,128 --> 00:26:33,291
We close with
good night, good luck;

339
00:26:33,397 --> 00:26:37,629
A merry Christmas and
God bless all of you,

340
00:26:37,735 --> 00:26:40,727
all of you on the good Earth.

341
00:26:41,939 --> 00:26:43,270
When we came back,

342
00:26:43,374 --> 00:26:46,468
there was a lady in Dallas, Texas,

343
00:26:46,577 --> 00:26:49,137
who was an atheist,

344
00:26:49,246 --> 00:26:51,009
and I don't have
anything against atheists,

345
00:26:51,115 --> 00:26:54,346
but she sued us.

346
00:26:54,450 --> 00:27:00,753
For the mixing of...
Church and State,

347
00:27:00,857 --> 00:27:04,315
and she said that
was inappropriate.

348
00:27:05,562 --> 00:27:07,223
Maybe it was, I don't know.

349
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,575
At that time, we were all practicing

350
00:27:27,683 --> 00:27:32,052
to go to the Apollo 11 site,
Sea of Tranquillity.

351
00:27:32,154 --> 00:27:35,248
Because we had
three different crews training.

352
00:27:36,692 --> 00:27:39,923
Apollo 11
was going to make the try in July

353
00:27:40,027 --> 00:27:43,690
and then two months later,
we'd make it if they didn't make it,

354
00:27:43,798 --> 00:27:45,060
and then if we didn't make it,

355
00:27:45,166 --> 00:27:47,657
two months later
in November, Apollo 13.

356
00:27:47,768 --> 00:27:51,795
So we had three chances to get to the Moon
by the end of the decade.

357
00:27:53,808 --> 00:27:58,245
And so when Neil and Buzz and Mike
were assigned to Apollo 11

358
00:27:58,346 --> 00:28:00,360
we knew they were going to make
the first shot.

359
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,575
They were a really,
really good crew,

360
00:28:02,682 --> 00:28:05,014
they got along really well.

361
00:28:06,286 --> 00:28:08,516
Mike was always the easy-going guy

362
00:28:08,622 --> 00:28:10,886
who brought levity into things.

363
00:28:10,991 --> 00:28:16,088
And I felt kind of bad that he wasn't
going to have the opportunity of being to...

364
00:28:16,196 --> 00:28:19,825
Being able to be in a Lunar Lander
and make a landing,

365
00:28:19,933 --> 00:28:21,491
but that was a decision that...

366
00:28:21,601 --> 00:28:24,035
certainly was way over my head.

367
00:28:24,137 --> 00:28:26,970
One guy had to stay
in the command module

368
00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:29,404
and the other two were
going to go to the Moon

369
00:28:29,508 --> 00:28:33,239
and I was... Pigeonholed,
if that's the right word,

370
00:28:33,345 --> 00:28:35,643
as a command module pilot
and so that...

371
00:28:35,748 --> 00:28:38,512
I lost my chance of...
of walking on the Moon

372
00:28:38,617 --> 00:28:43,953
but in return for that,
I gained a chance to...

373
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:45,489
A: Fly to the Moon

374
00:28:45,591 --> 00:28:50,722
and perhaps be a member
of the first crew to land on the Moon.

375
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,759
One thing I know about Buzz,

376
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:57,130
he's one of these guys
that's a lot smarter than most of us.

377
00:28:57,235 --> 00:29:00,261
He had a nickname,
Dr. Rendezvous.

378
00:29:00,371 --> 00:29:05,365
He loves to talk
about technical stuff,

379
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:06,535
particularly rendezvous.

380
00:29:06,644 --> 00:29:08,942
I mean, he'll get this
orbit going this way

381
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:10,981
and that orbit
going the other way

382
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:13,812
and he really grooved
on those things.

383
00:29:13,917 --> 00:29:16,181
You didn't want to sit
near him in a party

384
00:29:16,286 --> 00:29:18,880
because he would start
talking about rendezvous.

385
00:29:18,989 --> 00:29:20,650
And you would want to be talking

386
00:29:20,757 --> 00:29:23,157
about that good-looking
girl across the room.

387
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:26,787
He could care less,
he wanted to talk about rendezvous.

388
00:29:26,897 --> 00:29:30,424
And he'd been talking
to you about it all... all week long.

389
00:29:30,533 --> 00:29:34,492
That's right, that was what
I was really interested in.

390
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:40,036
I always respected
Neil Armstrong highly.

391
00:29:40,142 --> 00:29:44,579
He was probably
the coolest under pressure

392
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:48,980
of anyone that I had
ever had the privilege of flying with.

393
00:29:53,189 --> 00:29:55,680
He was just Mr. Coolstone,
if you will.

394
00:29:57,491 --> 00:30:00,255
One of the oddities
in Neil's training

395
00:30:00,361 --> 00:30:03,922
was this thing we lovingly called
"the flying bedstead".

396
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:06,125
It was an ungainly-
looking contraption

397
00:30:06,234 --> 00:30:09,931
and it was meant to imitate the L.M.,
the Lunar Module.

398
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:20,347
Neil, he and I were
in adjoining offices, same secretary.

399
00:30:21,581 --> 00:30:23,981
I remember one day I came in
in the morning,

400
00:30:24,084 --> 00:30:26,348
I run into a couple of guys, they say,

401
00:30:26,453 --> 00:30:32,119
"Do you know that Neil bailed
out of the LLTV this morning?"

402
00:30:42,969 --> 00:30:45,870
I said, "no way."
He said, whoever it was,

403
00:30:45,972 --> 00:30:47,530
Two or three guys said, "Yeah!"

404
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,631
I said, "Okay, I'm going
in there and ask him."

405
00:30:49,742 --> 00:30:50,766
So I go in there and Neil...

406
00:30:50,877 --> 00:30:53,607
Neil's fooling around,
nothing going on.

407
00:30:53,713 --> 00:30:55,772
I said, "those guys
out in the office

408
00:30:55,882 --> 00:30:58,715
Said you bailed out of
the LLTV this morning."

409
00:30:58,818 --> 00:31:00,012
He said, "Yeah."

410
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:02,053
That was all he said, "Yeah."

411
00:31:02,155 --> 00:31:04,487
I mean this guy had been
a second and a half

412
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:07,081
from being killed
and that was it.

413
00:31:07,192 --> 00:31:10,059
He didn't say,
"I nearly got killed",

414
00:31:10,162 --> 00:31:12,653
"I nearly, you know..."
I don't know what we...

415
00:31:12,764 --> 00:31:15,892
"Yeah."
That was it, that was it!

416
00:31:16,001 --> 00:31:18,060
I mean, what was he
supposed to do?

417
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:19,501
I mean, maybe
he could have gone out

418
00:31:19,604 --> 00:31:21,299
and gotten roaring
drunk or something

419
00:31:21,406 --> 00:31:23,567
but that's not Neil, you know?

420
00:31:23,675 --> 00:31:26,473
He went back and shuffled paper.
That's what you had to do.

421
00:31:26,578 --> 00:31:30,014
You know, the program goes on!

422
00:31:48,699 --> 00:31:53,500
Tomorrow we, the crew
of Apollo 11, are...

423
00:31:55,872 --> 00:32:00,969
privileged to represent
the United States

424
00:32:01,077 --> 00:32:04,478
in our first attempt

425
00:32:04,581 --> 00:32:08,950
to take Man to another
heavenly body.

426
00:32:49,924 --> 00:32:50,891
Um...

427
00:32:54,128 --> 00:32:57,120
Well, I'd given up smoking the pipe

428
00:32:57,231 --> 00:32:59,290
maybe three weeks before launch.

429
00:33:01,234 --> 00:33:04,203
That's my best recollection,

430
00:33:04,304 --> 00:33:08,001
maybe having a drink,
three days before.

431
00:33:11,311 --> 00:33:13,939
I don't think anybody
really slept too well

432
00:33:14,047 --> 00:33:16,515
the night before,
you're just wondering

433
00:33:16,616 --> 00:33:22,748
about whether you can...
get enough rest

434
00:33:22,855 --> 00:33:25,619
for what you need
to possibly do.

435
00:33:37,937 --> 00:33:41,703
This is CBS News
colour coverage of...

436
00:33:48,479 --> 00:33:51,471
Sponsored by Kellogg's.

437
00:33:51,582 --> 00:33:54,312
Kellogg's puts more
in your morning.

438
00:33:54,419 --> 00:33:56,785
Here from CBS News
Apollo headquarters

439
00:33:56,888 --> 00:34:00,551
at Kennedy Space Center,
correspondent Walter Cronkite.

440
00:34:00,658 --> 00:34:01,852
Good morning.

441
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,928
It's t-minus one hour,

442
00:34:04,028 --> 00:34:07,464
29 minutes and
53 seconds and counting.

443
00:34:07,565 --> 00:34:10,500
In just an hour and a half,
if all goes well,

444
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:14,229
Apollo 11 astronauts
Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins

445
00:34:14,338 --> 00:34:17,671
are to lift off from
pad 39-a out there,

446
00:34:17,774 --> 00:34:21,301
on the voyage Man always
has dreamed about.

447
00:34:21,411 --> 00:34:23,845
Next stop for them: The Moon.

448
00:34:41,797 --> 00:34:44,129
Well, on launch days, it's kind of strange,

449
00:34:44,233 --> 00:34:46,497
you go out in a van to the launch pad,

450
00:34:46,602 --> 00:34:48,866
and you're... you're kind of used to that.

451
00:34:48,971 --> 00:34:51,098
Riding in a van is the American way,

452
00:34:51,207 --> 00:34:53,698
so that's not a problem.

453
00:34:53,808 --> 00:34:58,939
When you get out to the base
of this gigantic gantry,

454
00:34:59,047 --> 00:35:02,847
it's... it's empty,
there's nobody there, it's deserted.

455
00:35:02,951 --> 00:35:07,388
And you're accustomed
to scores of workers,

456
00:35:07,488 --> 00:35:10,355
you know, swarming like ants
all up and down and around it,

457
00:35:10,458 --> 00:35:13,757
and, you know, you're in
with a crowd of people.

458
00:35:13,862 --> 00:35:17,127
And then suddenly
there's nobody there

459
00:35:17,231 --> 00:35:20,428
and you think, "God, you know,
maybe they know something I don't know!"

460
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:28,868
We got out there
to the launch pad.

461
00:35:28,976 --> 00:35:32,207
So I had about ten minutes to look out

462
00:35:32,312 --> 00:35:35,440
and see the Sun rise,
see the waves coming in

463
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:39,316
and see the evidence
of the people out on the side.

464
00:35:39,419 --> 00:35:42,786
Just... And thinking about the fact

465
00:35:42,889 --> 00:35:45,585
that this was something
I wanted to remember.

466
00:35:48,861 --> 00:35:50,920
So it is now, before they go,

467
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:55,296
as their gleaming vehicle
sits poised and peaceful

468
00:35:55,401 --> 00:35:57,926
out there behind me on pad 39-a,

469
00:35:58,037 --> 00:36:01,564
that there is time to
think of those three men

470
00:36:01,674 --> 00:36:03,437
and the burdens and the hopes

471
00:36:03,541 --> 00:36:07,443
that they carry on
behalf of all Mankind.

472
00:36:13,118 --> 00:36:16,417
I had the feeling
the whole world was watching us.

473
00:36:19,557 --> 00:36:23,459
So, not only do I have
a lot of things I can do wrong,

474
00:36:23,561 --> 00:36:27,497
but the consequences
should I do them wrong

475
00:36:27,598 --> 00:36:31,830
are going to be immediately obvious
to three billion people

476
00:36:31,936 --> 00:36:35,428
and... that's
a worrisome thought.

477
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:38,941
T-minus ten minutes
and counting, t-minus ten.

478
00:36:39,043 --> 00:36:40,943
We're aiming for our planned lift-off

479
00:36:41,045 --> 00:36:43,138
at 32 minutes past the hour.

480
00:36:43,247 --> 00:36:45,010
This is Kennedy launch control.

481
00:36:45,116 --> 00:36:48,142
I don't know why
people who have not been on rockets

482
00:36:48,251 --> 00:36:52,187
continue to ask
"You were not scared?"

483
00:36:52,288 --> 00:36:54,415
No, we were not scared!

484
00:36:54,523 --> 00:36:57,856
Until something happens,
then it's time to get scared.

485
00:36:57,961 --> 00:37:00,225
We're just past
the two minute mark in the countdown,

486
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:02,355
t-minus 1 minute, 54 seconds.

487
00:37:02,464 --> 00:37:05,661
The countdown
is a very negative thing.

488
00:37:05,768 --> 00:37:07,360
You just hope nothing goes wrong.

489
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:09,370
You think, "oh, whoosh,
we got by that one

490
00:37:09,473 --> 00:37:10,770
and maybe
we'll get by that one..."

491
00:37:10,873 --> 00:37:13,899
and then when you get
very close to launch,

492
00:37:14,009 --> 00:37:17,809
suddenly, it's like someone turned on
a big electric light bulb,

493
00:37:17,913 --> 00:37:21,405
You think, "You know,
I think we're really going to go, you know,

494
00:37:21,516 --> 00:37:24,280
I think it's going to happen.
We're going to leave!"

495
00:37:24,386 --> 00:37:26,149
30 seconds and counting.

496
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:30,421
Astronauts report it feels good.

497
00:37:30,526 --> 00:37:32,494
T-minus 25 seconds...

498
00:37:35,129 --> 00:37:37,222
20 seconds and counting.

499
00:37:39,333 --> 00:37:41,028
T-minus 15 seconds.

500
00:37:41,135 --> 00:37:43,000
Guidance is internal.

501
00:37:43,104 --> 00:37:46,904
12, 11, 10, 9...

502
00:37:47,008 --> 00:37:49,636
Ignition sequence starts.

503
00:37:49,744 --> 00:37:51,871
Six, five, four,

504
00:37:51,979 --> 00:37:56,507
Three, two, one, zero.

505
00:38:02,588 --> 00:38:04,419
At the moment of lift-off,

506
00:38:04,524 --> 00:38:07,550
There were numbers
changing on the dashboard,

507
00:38:07,661 --> 00:38:11,654
there were sounds
indicating in the voice loop

508
00:38:11,765 --> 00:38:16,634
that we'd had lift-off,
but what did we feel?

509
00:38:16,736 --> 00:38:20,467
I think we felt,
in those early moments,

510
00:38:20,573 --> 00:38:24,304
that we were not attached
to the ground any more,

511
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:27,868
but there was
a slight hunting, maybe,

512
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:29,845
of the guidance system.

513
00:38:29,949 --> 00:38:33,851
I'd describe it as a nervous novice

514
00:38:33,953 --> 00:38:36,683
driving a wide car down a narrow alley.

515
00:38:36,789 --> 00:38:39,189
You know, you've got to make corrections,
you're not quite sure.

516
00:38:39,291 --> 00:38:40,815
You zig this way and that way...

517
00:38:40,926 --> 00:38:44,123
And what it is,
it's those big motors underneath

518
00:38:44,229 --> 00:38:46,424
"gimbaling", you know,
swivelling back and forth

519
00:38:46,531 --> 00:38:47,623
to keep you in balance.

520
00:38:47,732 --> 00:38:50,360
This thing is a pencil as it goes up

521
00:38:50,468 --> 00:38:54,234
and it has to be
balanced very precisely.

522
00:38:54,339 --> 00:38:58,070
And the gimbaling of the motors,
you feel in the seat of your pants

523
00:38:58,176 --> 00:39:03,637
and thinking, "Gee, that launch tower
is just a few feet off to one side.

524
00:39:03,748 --> 00:39:07,343
I hope this sucker ain't gonna gimbal
over in that direction too much."

525
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:12,251
And then when they tell
you launch tower clear,

526
00:39:12,356 --> 00:39:13,880
you kind of say, "Oh, whoosh,

527
00:39:13,991 --> 00:39:17,017
that's good. We don't have to
worry about hitting that moose."

528
00:39:17,127 --> 00:39:19,186
And then off you go from there.

529
00:41:20,545 --> 00:41:24,072
Will metal
stand this kind of vibration?

530
00:41:24,181 --> 00:41:27,878
Have the engineers realized
how this thing shakes?

531
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:30,180
Because it shakes and vibrates

532
00:41:30,287 --> 00:41:32,619
so much more than I ever imagined.

533
00:41:35,126 --> 00:41:36,957
When they open up
the fuel manifolds,

534
00:41:37,061 --> 00:41:41,191
we could hear the fuel
rumble down these huge pipes.

535
00:41:41,298 --> 00:41:44,392
Then it dawned on me,
from an emotional point of view,

536
00:41:44,501 --> 00:41:46,162
that we're going to go to the Moon.

537
00:41:49,072 --> 00:41:50,767
The sound and the reverberations

538
00:41:50,874 --> 00:41:51,898
coming from those engines,

539
00:41:52,008 --> 00:41:53,703
those five engines
when they're ignited,

540
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:56,973
it shakes the whole body,
the reverberations from it.

541
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,206
It's very emotional.

542
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:03,382
You're not just riding along.

543
00:42:03,486 --> 00:42:05,647
A lot of people think
you're just lying on your back

544
00:42:05,755 --> 00:42:07,052
waiting for it to happen.

545
00:42:07,157 --> 00:42:09,455
But not really,
because every second

546
00:42:09,558 --> 00:42:12,186
is something of significance.

547
00:42:14,696 --> 00:42:16,891
I found out
from the flight surgeon later on

548
00:42:16,999 --> 00:42:22,062
that my heartbeat
was a 144 at lift-off.

549
00:42:23,705 --> 00:42:26,265
John's was 70.

550
00:42:26,375 --> 00:42:28,275
Yeah, well, I told him.

551
00:42:28,377 --> 00:42:31,210
I said mine was too old
to go any faster. Yeah.

552
00:42:32,647 --> 00:42:36,413
I was wondering, why did we do
all these launch simulations?

553
00:42:36,518 --> 00:42:39,851
If I had had to reach a switch
with all of that vibration going on

554
00:42:39,954 --> 00:42:43,219
I wouldn't have quite been sure
where I was putting my hand.

555
00:42:49,263 --> 00:42:51,697
We were on our way.

556
00:42:51,799 --> 00:42:53,824
What a ride, babe, what a ride!

557
00:42:53,934 --> 00:42:57,631
I had control of that vehicle
right in the palm of my hands.

558
00:42:57,737 --> 00:43:00,352
If the guidance failed
or started to stray

559
00:43:00,452 --> 00:43:02,703
or went somewhere we didn't like,
or the Ground didn't like,

560
00:43:02,809 --> 00:43:06,074
I could flip a switch
and I could control seven...

561
00:43:06,179 --> 00:43:08,340
over seven and a half million pounds

562
00:43:08,447 --> 00:43:11,007
of rocket thrust with this handle

563
00:43:11,117 --> 00:43:12,414
and fly the thing to the Moon myself.

564
00:43:12,518 --> 00:43:15,078
And I guarantee you, I had practiced it

565
00:43:15,188 --> 00:43:19,249
and trained for it so many times,
I almost dared...

566
00:43:19,358 --> 00:43:21,189
I almost dared her to quit on me.

567
00:43:24,864 --> 00:43:27,424
Every breath she breathed,
I breathed with her.

568
00:43:27,534 --> 00:43:30,560
She was uniquely something special

569
00:43:30,669 --> 00:43:33,399
and what a hell of a ride she gave us.

570
00:44:00,565 --> 00:44:03,033
We had been warned
about shutdown with the Saturn

571
00:44:03,133 --> 00:44:04,862
because you go
from four and a half Gs

572
00:44:04,968 --> 00:44:06,595
to zero just like that.

573
00:44:09,474 --> 00:44:11,942
And this big fireball

574
00:44:12,042 --> 00:44:15,534
comes roaring up
the length of that booster...

575
00:44:15,646 --> 00:44:19,082
And just...
Out in front of you

576
00:44:19,182 --> 00:44:20,877
then the second stage fires

577
00:44:20,984 --> 00:44:22,508
and you fly right through the fireball

578
00:44:22,619 --> 00:44:24,086
and you're on your way again.

579
00:44:24,187 --> 00:44:26,553
Roger, Houston,
you are go for staging.

580
00:44:38,267 --> 00:44:39,996
Houston, thrusters go, all engines.

581
00:44:40,102 --> 00:44:42,002
You're looking good.

582
00:44:42,104 --> 00:44:44,038
Roger, hearing you
loud and clear, Houston.

583
00:45:04,893 --> 00:45:05,860
Tower's gone.

584
00:45:05,961 --> 00:45:07,360
Roger, tower.

585
00:45:07,462 --> 00:45:10,090
Yeah!
They finally gave me a window to look out!

586
00:45:15,002 --> 00:45:16,902
You go up into Earth orbit

587
00:45:17,004 --> 00:45:19,734
and you go around the Earth once

588
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:21,740
and again that's a busy time,

589
00:45:21,842 --> 00:45:23,605
because you want to make sure

590
00:45:23,711 --> 00:45:27,112
that everything on board
is working properly

591
00:45:27,214 --> 00:45:29,910
before you set sail for the Moon.

592
00:45:31,819 --> 00:45:33,912
Apollo 11, this is Houston.

593
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:36,147
You are go for TLI. Over.

594
00:45:37,457 --> 00:45:39,721
Apollo 11, thank you.

595
00:45:39,826 --> 00:45:43,057
And then you get
the word you're go for TLI

596
00:45:43,162 --> 00:45:46,427
and that means you can ignite the motor

597
00:45:46,533 --> 00:45:49,058
and head on off to
the Moon and you do,

598
00:45:49,168 --> 00:45:51,432
and you go, and that's it!

599
00:46:03,048 --> 00:46:04,913
Ignition.

600
00:46:11,356 --> 00:46:14,348
We confirm ignition and the thrust is go.

601
00:46:15,994 --> 00:46:17,154
Just a second.

602
00:46:19,163 --> 00:46:21,290
Apollo 11, out.

603
00:46:21,399 --> 00:46:23,526
35,000 feet per second.

604
00:46:30,174 --> 00:46:31,436
Get out.

605
00:46:35,813 --> 00:46:41,217
Climb velocity 35,570 feet per second.

606
00:46:41,318 --> 00:46:44,776
Altitude, 177 nautical miles.

607
00:46:47,757 --> 00:46:49,349
Houston, Apollo 11,

608
00:46:49,459 --> 00:46:53,418
that Saturn gave us a magnificent ride.

609
00:46:53,530 --> 00:46:55,657
Uh, roger, 11,
we'll pass that on.

610
00:46:55,765 --> 00:46:58,359
And it kind of looks
like you're on your way now.

611
00:47:37,071 --> 00:47:40,404
In Earth orbit, the horizon's
just slightly curved.

612
00:47:40,508 --> 00:47:43,773
When you head on out to the Moon,
in very short order,

613
00:47:43,878 --> 00:47:46,108
and you get a chance
to look back at the Earth,

614
00:47:46,214 --> 00:47:49,149
that horizon slowly curves
around in upon itself

615
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:50,842
and all of a sudden,
you're looking at something...

616
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:54,114
that's very strange
but yet is very, very familiar

617
00:47:54,221 --> 00:47:58,055
because you're beginning
to see the Earth evolve.

618
00:47:59,525 --> 00:48:01,516
I was able to look out the window

619
00:48:01,628 --> 00:48:04,563
to see this incredible sight

620
00:48:04,664 --> 00:48:06,962
of the whole circle of the Earth.

621
00:48:09,002 --> 00:48:11,232
Oceans were crystal blue,

622
00:48:11,338 --> 00:48:13,670
the land was brown,

623
00:48:13,773 --> 00:48:16,264
and the clouds and the
snow were pure white

624
00:48:16,375 --> 00:48:17,774
and that jewel of Earth

625
00:48:17,877 --> 00:48:21,574
was just hung up in
the blackness of space.

626
00:48:26,553 --> 00:48:30,045
The only people that have seen
the whole circle of the Earth

627
00:48:30,156 --> 00:48:32,989
are the 24 guys that went to the Moon.

628
00:48:38,062 --> 00:48:41,225
When you see Earth like that, it's powerful.

629
00:48:41,332 --> 00:48:44,699
Not... Not even bigger
than that, way up there.

630
00:48:49,574 --> 00:48:53,874
How peaceful and calm
and quiet and serene it looked,

631
00:48:53,978 --> 00:48:56,242
how fragile it appeared.

632
00:48:56,347 --> 00:48:58,941
That was the... oddly enough...

633
00:48:59,049 --> 00:49:03,008
the overriding sensation I got
looking at the Earth was,

634
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:07,614
"My God, that little thing
is so fragile out there."

635
00:49:11,428 --> 00:49:13,055
You get to see
the Earth receding,

636
00:49:13,163 --> 00:49:16,098
you get to see the Moon
coming towards you...

637
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:19,431
And it's awe-inspiring.

638
00:49:19,535 --> 00:49:22,971
And you start to identify, "Hey,
we're going to be up there pretty soon,

639
00:49:23,072 --> 00:49:25,302
and, bye-bye, back there."

640
00:49:37,954 --> 00:49:40,047
This transmission is coming to you

641
00:49:40,156 --> 00:49:43,717
approximately halfway
between the Moon and the Earth.

642
00:49:43,826 --> 00:49:48,126
We've been 31 hours,
about 20 minutes into flight.

643
00:49:48,230 --> 00:49:49,993
We have about, uh,

644
00:49:50,098 --> 00:49:53,397
less than 40 hours left to go to the Moon.

645
00:49:53,501 --> 00:49:55,298
We journeyed on our way.

646
00:49:55,403 --> 00:49:56,836
We set up a course,

647
00:49:56,938 --> 00:49:59,736
we took our suits off
at this point, stowed them,

648
00:49:59,841 --> 00:50:03,743
we ate a meal and then
just went into our flight plan.

649
00:50:06,348 --> 00:50:08,111
You know,
wasn't Grandma's cooking,

650
00:50:08,215 --> 00:50:09,477
but it was worth it.

651
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:14,487
We did have hot water
on the command module

652
00:50:14,588 --> 00:50:16,180
and so we took, uh...

653
00:50:16,290 --> 00:50:19,225
a regular little shaving cream

654
00:50:19,326 --> 00:50:21,726
and a razor and had a tissue paper,

655
00:50:21,829 --> 00:50:23,797
And I can't tell you how good,

656
00:50:23,898 --> 00:50:27,857
after three or four days,
it feels to shave.

657
00:50:31,971 --> 00:50:33,268
In our checklist,

658
00:50:33,373 --> 00:50:37,309
it turned out that
my little boys and my wife,

659
00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:39,844
had these little
greetings, if you will,

660
00:50:39,946 --> 00:50:42,107
were inserted into the flight plan.

661
00:50:43,482 --> 00:50:46,542
This one was from my son, Charles.

662
00:50:46,653 --> 00:50:50,646
It says, just in crayon,

663
00:50:50,757 --> 00:50:52,987
"From Charles. We love you."

664
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:55,992
And on the other side,
he sort of had his idea

665
00:50:56,094 --> 00:51:00,622
of what the...
Lunar Module looks like.

666
00:51:02,434 --> 00:51:05,562
And Tom, that was not quite five,

667
00:51:05,671 --> 00:51:10,233
and he wrote "Dear Daddy,

668
00:51:10,342 --> 00:51:16,975
have a safe trip home. Love, Tom."

669
00:51:21,686 --> 00:51:25,452
It's not fear, it's worry.

670
00:51:25,556 --> 00:51:29,322
And I think there's a legitimate distinction
between the two.

671
00:51:29,427 --> 00:51:31,952
So, it's not a question
of you're scared all the time,

672
00:51:32,063 --> 00:51:35,965
but it is you're mildly worried all the time,
or at least, I was.

673
00:51:36,067 --> 00:51:38,900
You know, you're not sure all these things
are going to work properly,

674
00:51:39,002 --> 00:51:43,405
and there's a hell of a lot of them
coming in a very fragile daisy-chain

675
00:51:43,505 --> 00:51:46,303
and you don't want any of those links
in the chain to break

676
00:51:46,409 --> 00:51:50,675
because downstream from that broken link,
they're all useless.

677
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:53,442
So yes, you're worried,
you're concerned.

678
00:51:54,651 --> 00:51:59,054
I always thought of myself as one
of the more fearful astronauts, really.

679
00:52:01,091 --> 00:52:03,082
And when I'd look out of the window
of the spacecraft,

680
00:52:03,192 --> 00:52:05,786
I would think,
"If that window blows out,

681
00:52:05,894 --> 00:52:08,419
I'm going to die in about a second."

682
00:52:08,530 --> 00:52:11,363
There's death right out
there about an inch away.

683
00:52:13,468 --> 00:52:15,129
All your systems are looking good.

684
00:52:15,237 --> 00:52:16,226
Going around the corner.

685
00:52:16,338 --> 00:52:18,499
We'll see you on the other side, over.

686
00:52:19,942 --> 00:52:22,968
Everything looks okay up here.

687
00:52:23,078 --> 00:52:25,342
Roger, out.

688
00:52:25,446 --> 00:52:28,938
We... We didn't see the Moon
until after we were there.

689
00:52:29,050 --> 00:52:31,143
It's like some of these
science-fiction movies

690
00:52:31,252 --> 00:52:34,244
where you see this big meteorite
just slowly moving.

691
00:52:34,355 --> 00:52:36,050
You could feel the Moon's presence.

692
00:52:36,157 --> 00:52:38,284
You couldn't see it.

693
00:52:40,228 --> 00:52:41,559
We went into darkness,

694
00:52:41,662 --> 00:52:45,462
after being in daylight the whole time

695
00:52:45,566 --> 00:52:47,898
on the way to the Moon.

696
00:52:48,001 --> 00:52:50,435
And then we went into darkness.

697
00:52:53,607 --> 00:52:57,043
And we're in the shadow of the Moon.

698
00:53:38,283 --> 00:53:40,444
When the Sun is shining on the surface

699
00:53:40,553 --> 00:53:42,521
at a very shallow angle,

700
00:53:42,621 --> 00:53:45,487
the craters cast long shadows

701
00:53:45,590 --> 00:53:49,424
and the Moon's surface
seems very inhospitable.

702
00:53:49,527 --> 00:53:51,324
Forbidding, almost.

703
00:53:57,067 --> 00:54:00,662
I did not sense any great invitation

704
00:54:00,771 --> 00:54:04,764
on the part of the Moon
for us to come into its domain.

705
00:54:04,875 --> 00:54:08,675
I sensed more, almost a hostile place...

706
00:54:08,779 --> 00:54:11,213
A... a scary place.

707
00:54:34,404 --> 00:54:35,564
It was tense,

708
00:54:35,671 --> 00:54:39,232
because even though
they'd practiced it in the simulator cockpit,

709
00:54:39,342 --> 00:54:42,402
they didn't always make
a successful landing.

710
00:54:44,346 --> 00:54:47,577
You've got to end up down there
with just the right amount of fuel.

711
00:54:47,682 --> 00:54:50,947
Like, three minutes, you've got to be
at a certain altitude and air speed.

712
00:54:51,052 --> 00:54:52,246
It didn't work...

713
00:54:52,354 --> 00:54:55,255
Sometimes the update
from the landing radar didn't work,

714
00:54:55,356 --> 00:54:58,917
and this was when
we were trying to do it right,

715
00:54:59,027 --> 00:55:00,892
just to find a way to do it right.

716
00:55:00,996 --> 00:55:03,362
This was a big deal.

717
00:55:03,465 --> 00:55:05,262
Okay, it's go there, Capcom,

718
00:55:05,366 --> 00:55:06,526
on the hot fire, okay?

719
00:55:06,635 --> 00:55:08,102
All flight controllers going on the horn.

720
00:55:08,202 --> 00:55:09,897
Go, no-go for undocking!

721
00:55:10,004 --> 00:55:13,337
Retro? Go! Fido? Go! Guidance? Go!

722
00:55:13,441 --> 00:55:16,069
Control? Go!
Delcom? Go! GNC? Go!

723
00:55:16,177 --> 00:55:18,111
Ecom? Go! Surgeon? Go!

724
00:55:18,212 --> 00:55:19,804
Capcom, we're go
for undocking.

725
00:55:21,115 --> 00:55:22,639
Apollo 11, Houston,

726
00:55:22,750 --> 00:55:23,978
We're go for undocking, over.

727
00:55:35,995 --> 00:55:39,158
Capcom was
the capsule communicator

728
00:55:39,265 --> 00:55:41,563
and it was always an astronaut.

729
00:55:41,668 --> 00:55:44,159
and he was the only
one that was allowed

730
00:55:44,270 --> 00:55:47,433
to speak directly to the crew.

731
00:55:47,539 --> 00:55:49,837
Tell him to go... over.

732
00:55:49,942 --> 00:55:51,773
And so I was very, very excited

733
00:55:51,877 --> 00:55:56,041
to be part of that historic event.

734
00:55:56,148 --> 00:55:57,547
If... we pulled it off,

735
00:55:57,649 --> 00:56:00,243
was going to be
a tremendous honour.

736
00:56:35,052 --> 00:56:37,577
Capcom, we're go to continue PDI.

737
00:56:37,687 --> 00:56:39,314
You're go to...

738
00:56:39,422 --> 00:56:41,117
You're go to continue
powered descent.

739
00:56:41,224 --> 00:56:43,283
You're go to
continue powered descent.

740
00:56:46,463 --> 00:56:47,760
Okay, everybody. Let's hang tight,

741
00:56:47,864 --> 00:56:48,990
look for landing radar.

742
00:56:49,099 --> 00:56:50,066
Flight guns?

743
00:56:50,166 --> 00:56:51,599
Man 1:

744
00:56:51,701 --> 00:56:53,293
We'll meet that landing radar
by 18,000 with this down-track.

745
00:56:53,469 --> 00:56:54,436
Rog.

746
00:56:55,505 --> 00:56:59,407
The landing radar
was now beginning to receive signals

747
00:56:59,508 --> 00:57:04,468
and being Dr. Rendezvous,
no matter what the checklist said,

748
00:57:04,579 --> 00:57:09,107
I was going to leave
the rendezvous radar on and active

749
00:57:09,218 --> 00:57:12,915
so if we had to abort,
it was on and working

750
00:57:13,022 --> 00:57:17,152
and we could reacquire
mic as soon as possible

751
00:57:17,259 --> 00:57:18,783
if we had to go back up.

752
00:57:18,894 --> 00:57:20,259
Houston, we got data dropout,

753
00:57:20,362 --> 00:57:21,727
you're still looking good.

754
00:57:21,829 --> 00:57:24,161
Then we had a computer alarm.

755
00:57:24,265 --> 00:57:27,166
"Computer Problem, 1202".

756
00:57:27,268 --> 00:57:29,202
And well, what's 1202?

757
00:57:33,174 --> 00:57:36,905
1202, 1202!

758
00:57:37,011 --> 00:57:39,002
So when the crew reported this alarm,

759
00:57:39,113 --> 00:57:40,478
my heart sank, really.

760
00:57:40,581 --> 00:57:44,779
"Oh no, we've got a main,
primary computer problem.

761
00:57:44,885 --> 00:57:46,876
1202 alarm.

762
00:57:50,057 --> 00:57:52,082
Yeah, and same thing we had.

763
00:57:59,099 --> 00:58:01,397
So the landing radar
is feeding information,

764
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:03,161
the rendezvous radar is,

765
00:58:03,270 --> 00:58:09,732
and evidently that combination
was not anticipated by the guys at M.I.T.

766
00:58:09,842 --> 00:58:11,036
They're pretty narrow-minded.

767
00:58:11,143 --> 00:58:14,510
You're making a descent,
you need the radar, landing radar!

768
00:58:14,613 --> 00:58:16,410
You're making a rendezvous,
you need the rende...

769
00:58:16,515 --> 00:58:18,005
But you don't need to mix the two.

770
00:58:19,551 --> 00:58:21,542
But they didn't think the same way I did.

771
00:58:27,526 --> 00:58:30,984
The guidance guy,
Steve Bales, responded...

772
00:58:31,096 --> 00:58:33,121
We're go on that flight!

773
00:58:33,231 --> 00:58:35,461
I heard him say that
to flight control

774
00:58:35,568 --> 00:58:38,002
and I just voiced right up,

775
00:58:38,103 --> 00:58:40,230
"We're go, we're go, Eagle."

776
00:58:40,338 --> 00:58:42,101
And we were go.

777
00:58:42,207 --> 00:58:44,675
Eagle, Houston,
you are go for landing, over.

778
00:58:44,776 --> 00:58:45,970
Roger, understand.

779
00:58:46,077 --> 00:58:47,567
Going for landing, 3000 feet.

780
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:49,943
Look out for alarm: 1201.

781
00:58:50,048 --> 00:58:51,106
1201?

782
00:58:51,216 --> 00:58:52,444
Roger, 1201.

783
00:58:52,550 --> 00:58:53,574
Same type, we're go, flight.

784
00:58:53,684 --> 00:58:55,015
- Okay, we're go.
- We're go.

785
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:56,586
Same type, we're go.

786
00:58:56,687 --> 00:58:58,314
47 degrees.

787
00:58:58,422 --> 00:58:59,946
Roger.

788
00:59:00,057 --> 00:59:02,082
Descent, two fuel only.

789
00:59:02,192 --> 00:59:05,161
Fuel critical.
They didn't want to say critical.

790
00:59:05,262 --> 00:59:07,093
And then it seemed like Neil

791
00:59:07,197 --> 00:59:11,930
was having a difficult time
finding a suitable spot to put it down

792
00:59:12,035 --> 00:59:14,902
and I got a little worried then

793
00:59:15,005 --> 00:59:17,030
because they didn't have
a lot of extra fuel.

794
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:19,301
I think we better be quiet, Mike.

795
00:59:19,409 --> 00:59:21,036
400 feet, down at 9.

796
00:59:21,144 --> 00:59:23,806
Okay, the only call-outs
from now on will be fuel.

797
00:59:23,913 --> 00:59:27,508
The guidance system
was carrying them into a big boulder field

798
00:59:27,617 --> 00:59:29,710
and it wasn't suitable to land.

799
00:59:29,819 --> 00:59:31,844
So we noticed the trajectory level off

800
00:59:31,954 --> 00:59:35,412
and he just started
flying almost horizontal

801
00:59:35,525 --> 00:59:38,358
across the Moon at a high rate of speed.

802
00:59:38,459 --> 00:59:41,053
One of the worst things
you can do for gas

803
00:59:41,163 --> 00:59:43,791
is stop your rate of descent

804
00:59:43,899 --> 00:59:46,834
because then you have to take time
flying level,

805
00:59:46,935 --> 00:59:49,495
then you have to get
your rate of descent built up again.

806
00:59:49,604 --> 00:59:51,629
All that takes gas, okay?

807
00:59:51,740 --> 00:59:55,733
So when he levelled off, I thought,
"I wonder if he's going to make it."

808
00:59:55,844 --> 00:59:58,711
If... If there was a
boulder field and a crater

809
00:59:58,814 --> 01:00:00,782
that we wanted to avoid,

810
01:00:00,882 --> 01:00:03,680
there are four things you can do.

811
01:00:03,784 --> 01:00:05,251
You can land short,

812
01:00:05,352 --> 01:00:08,412
you can land left, right, or land long.

813
01:00:08,522 --> 01:00:11,355
All right, to land short,
you've got to pitch up like this

814
01:00:11,459 --> 01:00:13,984
and you lose sight
of where you're going.

815
01:00:14,094 --> 01:00:16,028
And... Either left or right

816
01:00:16,130 --> 01:00:18,394
is also a pretty drastic manoeuvre.

817
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:21,867
The easiest thing to do
is to just pitch forward a little bit

818
01:00:21,969 --> 01:00:23,527
and fly over and land long.

819
01:00:23,637 --> 01:00:26,265
Some of these boulders
were the size of Volkswagens

820
01:00:26,372 --> 01:00:29,341
and you don't want to land
with one gear on top of one

821
01:00:29,442 --> 01:00:31,034
and one gear down in a hole.

822
01:00:31,144 --> 01:00:33,135
That would not have been good.

823
01:00:33,246 --> 01:00:37,444
So, it was a little... Iffy
right there at the very end.

824
01:00:41,955 --> 01:00:45,618
We had two calls
that we were to give from mission control.

825
01:00:45,725 --> 01:00:50,059
The first was "Eagle, 60 seconds",

826
01:00:50,162 --> 01:00:53,063
that meant he got
60 more seconds to land

827
01:00:53,165 --> 01:00:55,463
and at the end of that 60 seconds,

828
01:00:55,567 --> 01:00:59,401
by mission rule, I would call abort.

829
01:00:59,505 --> 01:01:02,133
I never imagined
that he wasn't going to land by then

830
01:01:02,241 --> 01:01:04,175
because I think he
would have dropped it in

831
01:01:04,276 --> 01:01:05,971
from wherever the engine quit.

832
01:01:06,078 --> 01:01:07,773
He wasn't coming home and saying,

833
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:11,179
"I got low on fuel
so I decided to abandon it."

834
01:01:11,282 --> 01:01:12,977
I don't think any
astronaut would do that,

835
01:01:13,084 --> 01:01:14,415
that wouldn't be the right stuff!

836
01:01:14,519 --> 01:01:17,420
300 feet down.
Three and a half. 47 forward.

837
01:01:17,522 --> 01:01:20,150
Neil thinks things through thoroughly

838
01:01:20,258 --> 01:01:22,192
and then does what he thinks is right

839
01:01:22,293 --> 01:01:25,194
and usually it's the right thing to do.

840
01:01:25,296 --> 01:01:28,288
I don't think anybody can come close

841
01:01:28,399 --> 01:01:31,300
to touching the skills that he had.

842
01:01:31,402 --> 01:01:35,338
75 feet, just down a half. Roger, over.

843
01:01:35,438 --> 01:01:37,770
60. 60 seconds.

844
01:01:37,874 --> 01:01:40,707
The tension mounted in mission control

845
01:01:40,810 --> 01:01:44,075
and it was like you could feel it.

846
01:01:44,180 --> 01:01:47,707
You couldn't see it,
but you could sense the tension.

847
01:01:47,817 --> 01:01:52,083
And it was...
I remember dead silence.

848
01:01:57,960 --> 01:01:59,587
Three feet down, two and a half.

849
01:01:59,695 --> 01:02:01,822
Picking up some dust.

850
01:02:01,931 --> 01:02:03,796
Three feet, two and a half down.

851
01:02:07,703 --> 01:02:09,500
Pull forward.
Just into the right a little.

852
01:02:09,605 --> 01:02:11,129
30 seconds!

853
01:02:19,147 --> 01:02:20,205
Contact light.

854
01:02:24,352 --> 01:02:26,047
Okay, engines stop.

855
01:02:26,154 --> 01:02:27,121
Descent.

856
01:02:28,389 --> 01:02:29,481
Remote control, both on.

857
01:02:29,591 --> 01:02:31,718
Descent engine Command override off.

858
01:02:31,826 --> 01:02:33,521
Engine arm off.

859
01:02:33,628 --> 01:02:36,426
413 is in.

860
01:02:36,531 --> 01:02:38,123
We've had shut down.

861
01:02:38,232 --> 01:02:40,132
We copy you down, Eagle.

862
01:02:40,234 --> 01:02:43,135
Okay, everybody, t-1,
stand by for t-1.

863
01:02:44,304 --> 01:02:45,669
Tranquillity Base here.

864
01:02:45,772 --> 01:02:47,137
The Eagle has landed!

865
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:49,265
Roger, twang... Tranquillity,

866
01:02:49,376 --> 01:02:50,536
We copy you on the ground.

867
01:02:50,644 --> 01:02:52,544
You've got a bunch of
guys about to turn blue.

868
01:02:52,646 --> 01:02:54,307
We're breathing again,
thanks a lot.

869
01:02:55,450 --> 01:02:56,610
Thank you.

870
01:02:56,717 --> 01:02:57,775
I was so excited,

871
01:02:57,884 --> 01:02:59,875
I couldn't even get out "Tranquillity".

872
01:02:59,987 --> 01:03:02,512
It was "twang-quillity"
or something like that.

873
01:03:11,496 --> 01:03:13,293
Whew! Boy!

874
01:03:15,234 --> 01:03:16,997
Special announcement!

875
01:03:17,103 --> 01:03:18,968
You will be happy to know

876
01:03:19,071 --> 01:03:23,303
that the Apollo 11 has landed safely.

877
01:03:34,919 --> 01:03:36,614
I think it's just wonderful

878
01:03:36,721 --> 01:03:40,213
to be on Earth and to live
what's going on on the Moon.

879
01:03:40,325 --> 01:03:42,054
It's marvellous!

880
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:44,253
And as a French woman,
how do you think about it?

881
01:03:44,362 --> 01:03:45,454
Oh, I think it's wonderful.

882
01:03:45,563 --> 01:03:48,464
I always trusted America
and I knew they couldn't fail.

883
01:03:50,067 --> 01:03:52,228
I think we might have
gone and had a beer.

884
01:03:52,336 --> 01:03:54,395
But I...

885
01:03:54,505 --> 01:03:56,473
So we were real happy and it was...

886
01:03:56,573 --> 01:03:57,870
Real pleased we'd done it

887
01:03:57,975 --> 01:04:01,536
and so it was a great feeling
of accomplishment and pride,

888
01:04:01,645 --> 01:04:05,103
For the... President Kennedy
and for the nation,

889
01:04:05,215 --> 01:04:07,240
we did what we said we were going to do.

890
01:04:18,027 --> 01:04:19,824
Roger. We read you five-by, Columbia.

891
01:04:19,929 --> 01:04:21,954
He has landed.
Tranquillity Base.

892
01:04:22,065 --> 01:04:25,193
Eagle is at
Tranquillity, over.

893
01:04:25,301 --> 01:04:26,791
Yeah, I heard the whole thing!

894
01:04:26,903 --> 01:04:29,201
Well, it was a good show.

895
01:04:29,305 --> 01:04:31,034
Fantastic.

896
01:04:35,944 --> 01:04:37,002
I discovered later

897
01:04:37,112 --> 01:04:41,981
that I was described as
the loneliest man ever

898
01:04:42,084 --> 01:04:46,612
in the universe or something,
which really is a lot of baloney.

899
01:04:46,722 --> 01:04:49,885
I mean, I...
I had mission control

900
01:04:49,991 --> 01:04:54,052
yakking in my ear half the time.

901
01:04:55,464 --> 01:04:58,558
Columbia, Houston. How did it go? Over.

902
01:04:58,666 --> 01:05:00,224
Listen, babe,

903
01:05:00,334 --> 01:05:02,461
everything is going just swimmingly,
it's beautiful.

904
01:05:04,004 --> 01:05:05,198
I rather enjoyed it.

905
01:05:05,306 --> 01:05:07,672
I certainly was aware of the fact

906
01:05:07,775 --> 01:05:10,039
that I was by myself,

907
01:05:10,144 --> 01:05:13,238
particularly when I was over
on the back side of the Moon.

908
01:05:13,347 --> 01:05:16,180
You know, I can remember
thinking, "God, you look over there

909
01:05:16,283 --> 01:05:19,343
and there's 3 billion people,

910
01:05:19,453 --> 01:05:22,752
plus two, somewhere down there,

911
01:05:22,856 --> 01:05:27,156
and then over here there's one plus...

912
01:05:27,260 --> 01:05:28,659
God only knows what!"

913
01:05:28,762 --> 01:05:31,356
So, I... I know I felt that strongly,

914
01:05:31,464 --> 01:05:34,490
but I didn't feel it as loneliness

915
01:05:34,601 --> 01:05:36,432
and I certainly didn't feel it as fear,

916
01:05:36,535 --> 01:05:39,060
I felt it as awareness,

917
01:05:39,172 --> 01:05:41,140
almost a feeling of exaltation.

918
01:05:41,241 --> 01:05:43,141
I... I liked it.
It was a good feeling.

919
01:05:44,777 --> 01:05:46,904
Everything was going well
with the command module,

920
01:05:47,012 --> 01:05:50,413
I had my happy little home,
I had the bright lights on.

921
01:05:50,516 --> 01:05:52,609
Everything was fine. I enjoyed that time.

922
01:05:57,222 --> 01:06:01,750
They're going to probably open
the hatch of the Lunar Module

923
01:06:01,860 --> 01:06:03,953
around 9:00 o'clock
Eastern Daylight time,

924
01:06:04,062 --> 01:06:06,690
just two hours from now
and shortly after that,

925
01:06:06,798 --> 01:06:09,733
38-year-old Neil Armstrong, civilian,

926
01:06:09,834 --> 01:06:11,301
of Wapakoneta, Ohio,

927
01:06:11,402 --> 01:06:13,870
the Commander of this
successful Moon mission

928
01:06:13,971 --> 01:06:17,771
will begin to step down the nine steps
of the Lunar landing Module

929
01:06:17,875 --> 01:06:20,173
to the surface of the Moon itself.

930
01:06:20,278 --> 01:06:21,939
And what a moment that will be!

931
01:06:22,046 --> 01:06:24,640
And we're getting a picture on the TV.

932
01:06:24,749 --> 01:06:27,217
There's a great deal of contrast in it

933
01:06:27,318 --> 01:06:30,412
and currently,
it's upside down on our monitor

934
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:33,250
but we can make out a fair amount of detail.

935
01:06:33,356 --> 01:06:35,950
I realised,
of all the science-fiction writers

936
01:06:36,059 --> 01:06:37,959
who ever wrote about going to the Moon,

937
01:06:38,061 --> 01:06:40,791
I don't believe any of them ever dreamed

938
01:06:40,897 --> 01:06:43,593
about the world watching it on television.

939
01:06:47,504 --> 01:06:49,028
Neil, this is Houston,

940
01:06:49,139 --> 01:06:51,972
loud and clear.
Break, break, Buzz, this is Houston,

941
01:06:52,075 --> 01:06:54,908
Uh, radio check, and
verify TV circuit breaker.

942
01:06:56,477 --> 01:06:58,411
Roger, TV circuit breaker's in.

943
01:07:07,223 --> 01:07:08,281
Okay, Neil,

944
01:07:08,389 --> 01:07:10,289
we can see you coming
down the ladder now.

945
01:07:13,095 --> 01:07:16,155
Every place I go,
everybody I see, meet,

946
01:07:16,264 --> 01:07:19,927
even people who were children,
tiny babies at the time,

947
01:07:20,034 --> 01:07:22,798
watched Neil put his
first step on the Moon,

948
01:07:22,904 --> 01:07:24,633
the whole world participated.

949
01:07:24,739 --> 01:07:26,070
...Que I'homme pour la premiere fois,

950
01:07:26,174 --> 01:07:27,903
prenne pied sur la lune.

951
01:07:28,009 --> 01:07:29,772
Les Russes sont loin...
naturellement.

952
01:07:40,120 --> 01:07:41,781
Stand by.

953
01:07:51,598 --> 01:07:54,431
I'm at the foot of the ladder.

954
01:07:54,534 --> 01:07:58,994
The L.M. footpads are only, uh...

955
01:07:59,106 --> 01:08:03,406
Depressed in the surface about...
one or two inches,

956
01:08:03,509 --> 01:08:08,105
although the surface appears to be

957
01:08:08,214 --> 01:08:11,706
very, very fine-grained
as you get close to it.

958
01:08:11,817 --> 01:08:15,480
It's almost like a powder down there.

959
01:08:15,588 --> 01:08:17,112
It's very fine.

960
01:08:24,930 --> 01:08:27,057
Okay, I'm going to step off the L.M. now.

961
01:08:36,441 --> 01:08:39,205
That's one small step for Man...

962
01:08:41,713 --> 01:08:44,876
One giant leap for Mankind.

963
01:08:46,582 --> 01:08:49,676
"That's one small step for Man,

964
01:08:49,787 --> 01:08:53,655
One giant leap for Mankind."

965
01:09:12,508 --> 01:09:14,032
It was like Neil,

966
01:09:14,143 --> 01:09:16,703
but deeper than I thought

967
01:09:16,813 --> 01:09:19,509
that he would come up with.

968
01:09:19,615 --> 01:09:23,608
I wouldn't have had the
self-control to do that.

969
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:24,778
I'd have...

970
01:09:24,887 --> 01:09:26,616
To me, I'd have been
jumping up and down,

971
01:09:26,723 --> 01:09:28,953
"Yahoo!" You know?
"Man, I'm here!"

972
01:09:29,058 --> 01:09:32,084
It was... That's the kind of response
that I think I would have had.

973
01:09:32,194 --> 01:09:36,358
But he was very, very controlled

974
01:09:36,466 --> 01:09:39,264
and those words came out

975
01:09:39,368 --> 01:09:42,428
and they were very appropriate
and... Perfect.

976
01:09:44,272 --> 01:09:46,001
That looks beautiful from here, Neil.

977
01:09:46,108 --> 01:09:48,269
It has a stark beauty all its own,

978
01:09:48,378 --> 01:09:52,838
it's like much of the high desert
of the United States.

979
01:09:52,948 --> 01:09:56,315
It's different
but it's very pretty out here.

980
01:09:56,416 --> 01:09:58,907
We had it in our flight plan

981
01:09:59,020 --> 01:10:02,979
that we'd take the first 10-15 seconds

982
01:10:03,090 --> 01:10:04,682
down at the bottom of the ladder,

983
01:10:04,792 --> 01:10:07,693
sort of hold on to the
edge of the landing gear

984
01:10:07,795 --> 01:10:11,492
and just sort of check
our stability and so forth.

985
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:13,227
Okay, I'm on the top steps

986
01:10:13,334 --> 01:10:15,461
and it's a very simple
matter to hop down

987
01:10:15,569 --> 01:10:16,934
from one step to the next.

988
01:10:17,038 --> 01:10:18,801
So that's when I decided

989
01:10:18,905 --> 01:10:21,601
to take that period of time to, ah...

990
01:10:21,708 --> 01:10:24,973
To...

991
01:10:25,078 --> 01:10:26,773
Take care of a bodily function

992
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:29,747
of slightly filling up the urine bag,

993
01:10:29,849 --> 01:10:34,115
so that I wouldn't be troubled

994
01:10:34,220 --> 01:10:36,279
with having to do that later on.

995
01:10:37,357 --> 01:10:38,949
There you go.

996
01:10:39,059 --> 01:10:42,153
So, anyway, everybody has
their firsts on the Moon.

997
01:10:44,229 --> 01:10:47,289
And that one hasn't been
disputed by anybody.

998
01:10:53,272 --> 01:10:55,240
The only change
that I noticed they made

999
01:10:55,340 --> 01:10:58,707
prior to their flight
was they'd come to them

1000
01:10:58,811 --> 01:11:01,006
about a month ahead of time,
as I remember.

1001
01:11:01,113 --> 01:11:03,172
And they said to them,

1002
01:11:03,282 --> 01:11:05,944
"You're going to plant
the American flag."

1003
01:11:06,050 --> 01:11:10,953
So, we got the flag out
and put it in the ground

1004
01:11:11,055 --> 01:11:14,957
and we'd never really
practiced that one before.

1005
01:11:32,075 --> 01:11:34,168
Here we were on the surface

1006
01:11:34,277 --> 01:11:38,941
and I knew this was what
people were watching.

1007
01:11:39,049 --> 01:11:40,710
More people were watching us

1008
01:11:40,817 --> 01:11:44,253
than had ever watched two human beings
before in history

1009
01:11:44,354 --> 01:11:48,256
and yet we're further away,
not just in distance

1010
01:11:48,359 --> 01:11:51,021
but in things we've got to do
to get back home.

1011
01:11:51,127 --> 01:11:53,527
We've got to do some difficult things

1012
01:11:53,629 --> 01:11:55,927
to get out of this desolate place

1013
01:11:56,031 --> 01:11:57,896
and get back home again.

1014
01:12:23,625 --> 01:12:25,115
Thank you, 13.

1015
01:12:25,226 --> 01:12:27,922
13, we've got one more item for you
when you get a chance.

1016
01:12:28,029 --> 01:12:30,827
We'd like you to stir up your cryo tanks.

1017
01:12:33,635 --> 01:12:34,761
Stand by.

1018
01:12:37,938 --> 01:12:39,428
When the explosion occurred, of course,

1019
01:12:39,540 --> 01:12:41,872
I didn't know what happened.

1020
01:12:41,975 --> 01:12:45,035
Houston, we've had a problem.

1021
01:12:45,145 --> 01:12:47,010
Stand by 13, we're looking at it.

1022
01:12:50,350 --> 01:12:53,547
We saw the oxygen go to zero

1023
01:12:53,654 --> 01:12:55,451
And then come up to the top

1024
01:12:55,556 --> 01:12:56,887
and then went down to zero again.

1025
01:13:06,165 --> 01:13:07,757
We were in serious trouble.

1026
01:13:10,703 --> 01:13:12,898
I thought when I saw
that oxygen system leaking down,

1027
01:13:13,005 --> 01:13:15,303
I figured we'd lost them.
I really did.

1028
01:13:15,408 --> 01:13:16,898
I didn't think we'd make it.

1029
01:13:18,578 --> 01:13:20,705
We were as calm as could be.

1030
01:13:20,812 --> 01:13:23,906
We didn't panic.
Uh, if we did,

1031
01:13:24,015 --> 01:13:25,414
we'd still be up there,

1032
01:13:25,517 --> 01:13:28,111
or we could have
bounced off the walls for ten minutes

1033
01:13:28,220 --> 01:13:30,415
and be back where we started from.

1034
01:13:30,522 --> 01:13:33,150
So the first thing
that went through our mind was:

1035
01:13:33,258 --> 01:13:35,556
"What do we have to work with
to get home?"

1036
01:13:35,660 --> 01:13:38,823
And of course,
we had the Lunar Module.

1037
01:13:38,930 --> 01:13:42,263
It was like, abandon ship,
get into the lifeboat

1038
01:13:42,367 --> 01:13:44,801
and we'll come back in the lifeboat.

1039
01:13:47,171 --> 01:13:48,934
We figure we've got about 15 minutes

1040
01:13:49,039 --> 01:13:50,472
worth of power left
in the Command Module

1041
01:13:50,574 --> 01:13:53,702
so we want you to start
getting over in the L.M.,

1042
01:13:53,811 --> 01:13:55,870
and getting some power in it.

1043
01:13:55,980 --> 01:13:57,948
And you ready to copy your procedure?

1044
01:13:58,048 --> 01:13:59,276
Okay.

1045
01:14:06,189 --> 01:14:09,590
I worked on the problem
of using the Lunar Module

1046
01:14:09,692 --> 01:14:14,152
as the prime propulsion vehicle,
as a tugboat.

1047
01:14:14,264 --> 01:14:18,064
and how they could fly it manually,
stick and rudder stuff,

1048
01:14:18,167 --> 01:14:21,102
if they'd lost the prime guidance system.

1049
01:14:22,272 --> 01:14:23,762
John and I, with others,

1050
01:14:23,873 --> 01:14:26,205
had worked on this manoeuvre
to get them back

1051
01:14:26,309 --> 01:14:29,142
on what was called a
free return trajectory,

1052
01:14:29,244 --> 01:14:30,302
so they would come back

1053
01:14:30,412 --> 01:14:33,813
and come right back
into Earth's atmosphere

1054
01:14:33,915 --> 01:14:36,145
on the correct angle and velocity.

1055
01:14:37,753 --> 01:14:41,621
Apollo 13, 2 minutes away now
from scheduled time of ignition.

1056
01:14:41,723 --> 01:14:44,453
And so we used the Earth's terminator

1057
01:14:44,559 --> 01:14:46,288
to figure out our attitude,

1058
01:14:46,395 --> 01:14:50,354
we had to get the Earth in the window
of the Lunar Module.

1059
01:14:50,465 --> 01:14:52,365
Confirmed ignition.

1060
01:14:52,465 --> 01:14:54,194
I knew when that engine went on,

1061
01:14:54,302 --> 01:14:58,295
without an autopilot, I'd never be able
to keep the Earth in the window by myself,

1062
01:14:58,406 --> 01:15:00,670
so Fred-O kept the Earth
from going sideways,

1063
01:15:00,775 --> 01:15:02,436
I kept it from going up and down...

1064
01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:07,875
I had to learn to...
manoeuvre all over again

1065
01:15:07,982 --> 01:15:09,540
in a very short period of time.

1066
01:15:09,650 --> 01:15:12,050
But you'd be surprised
how quickly you learn.

1067
01:15:13,521 --> 01:15:15,352
Houston, you're looking good.

1068
01:15:15,454 --> 01:15:17,945
My attitude went from,
"We ain't going to make it"

1069
01:15:18,058 --> 01:15:20,959
to, "If we don't foul up
and they don't foul up,

1070
01:15:21,061 --> 01:15:23,689
and we don't have any other disaster,

1071
01:15:23,797 --> 01:15:24,786
we're going to make it."

1072
01:15:34,507 --> 01:15:37,533
It was NASA's greatest moment,
I'm convinced.

1073
01:15:37,642 --> 01:15:41,339
And that crew,
to keep calm and responsive

1074
01:15:41,447 --> 01:15:43,415
and do things right the first time,

1075
01:15:43,515 --> 01:15:47,076
that's important, it was just great.
They were great.

1076
01:15:47,186 --> 01:15:51,145
It was a case of survival
and certainly landing on the Moon

1077
01:15:51,256 --> 01:15:55,522
and surviving to see the next sunrise
are two different things.

1078
01:15:55,627 --> 01:15:59,461
And it wasn't until I got
comfortably back on Earth

1079
01:15:59,565 --> 01:16:02,125
that I became very much disappointed

1080
01:16:02,233 --> 01:16:05,134
in not making a landing on the Moon.

1081
01:16:18,983 --> 01:16:20,143
Boy, that's a big mountain

1082
01:16:20,251 --> 01:16:21,650
when you're down here
looking up, isn't it?

1083
01:16:21,753 --> 01:16:23,118
We all of a sudden realized

1084
01:16:23,220 --> 01:16:25,347
that we were below the
tops of the mountains.

1085
01:16:25,455 --> 01:16:27,753
I can't believe it. Amazing!

1086
01:16:27,858 --> 01:16:29,689
And then I look out at the horizon

1087
01:16:29,793 --> 01:16:31,385
and I thought to myself,

1088
01:16:31,495 --> 01:16:35,090
"God, I hope Pete doesn't land
over there because we'll tip over."

1089
01:16:35,198 --> 01:16:36,563
Here comes the shadow.

1090
01:16:36,666 --> 01:16:39,157
We were blowing lunar dust everywhere.

1091
01:16:39,269 --> 01:16:41,294
It was like landing through the fog.

1092
01:16:45,175 --> 01:16:46,608
Well, we is here!

1093
01:16:46,709 --> 01:16:49,075
Man, is we here!
How's that look?

1094
01:16:49,178 --> 01:16:50,907
And if there's any one moment

1095
01:16:51,013 --> 01:16:53,641
in my whole flight when time stood still,

1096
01:16:53,749 --> 01:16:57,310
it was those first few seconds
when we touched down

1097
01:16:57,420 --> 01:17:00,514
and everything came to a screeching halt.

1098
01:17:00,622 --> 01:17:02,112
And there we were.

1099
01:17:09,931 --> 01:17:11,592
The first feelings were,

1100
01:17:11,699 --> 01:17:14,395
"Wow, this is, uh...
What am I doing here?

1101
01:17:14,502 --> 01:17:16,629
This is a different world!"

1102
01:17:16,738 --> 01:17:19,366
And, uh, there's a part of it of...

1103
01:17:19,474 --> 01:17:22,910
"You dumb ass... You've really got yourself
into something here!"

1104
01:17:29,884 --> 01:17:32,284
When you land
on the Moon and you stop,

1105
01:17:32,386 --> 01:17:35,150
and you get out, nobody's out there.

1106
01:17:35,255 --> 01:17:38,691
This little L.M. and then
the two of you, you're it,

1107
01:17:38,792 --> 01:17:41,226
on this whole big place.

1108
01:17:41,327 --> 01:17:46,526
And that's a weird feeling,
it's a weird feeling to be...

1109
01:17:46,633 --> 01:17:48,931
Two people and that's it.

1110
01:17:54,674 --> 01:17:59,270
Oh, my golly. Unbelievable!

1111
01:17:59,378 --> 01:18:00,367
Unbelievable.

1112
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:03,540
But is it bright in the Sun.

1113
01:18:03,649 --> 01:18:05,310
Oh, look at that.

1114
01:18:05,418 --> 01:18:07,386
Isn't that something?

1115
01:18:07,487 --> 01:18:09,079
We're up on a slope, Joe,

1116
01:18:09,188 --> 01:18:10,780
and we're looking back
down into the valley.

1117
01:18:10,890 --> 01:18:14,519
It's beautiful.
That is spectacular.

1118
01:18:23,869 --> 01:18:27,270
Dad, this is really
a rock and rolling ride, isn't it?

1119
01:18:28,740 --> 01:18:31,470
Never been on a ride like this before.

1120
01:18:31,576 --> 01:18:34,602
The Rover was very useful,

1121
01:18:34,713 --> 01:18:37,841
very comfortable ride for the most part,

1122
01:18:37,949 --> 01:18:40,884
but any time you hit
a bump in one-sixth gravity,

1123
01:18:40,985 --> 01:18:43,010
you're going to be off the surface
for a little ways.

1124
01:18:47,558 --> 01:18:50,254
I hold the world's speed record
downhill in a Rover.

1125
01:18:50,361 --> 01:18:53,797
I think it was
17 kilometres per hour, downhill.

1126
01:18:56,934 --> 01:19:00,426
I think even Gene Cernan
with all his test pilot macho

1127
01:19:00,538 --> 01:19:02,506
felt that that was a little fast!

1128
01:19:02,606 --> 01:19:03,971
There are a lot of craters

1129
01:19:04,073 --> 01:19:05,597
and it's just sporty driving.

1130
01:19:05,708 --> 01:19:07,835
I've just got to keep my eye
on the road every second.

1131
01:19:09,446 --> 01:19:10,413
What really saves you up there

1132
01:19:10,513 --> 01:19:13,073
is there's nobody coming down the road
from the other way.

1133
01:19:13,182 --> 01:19:15,047
Oh, look at this baby climb the hill.

1134
01:19:24,027 --> 01:19:26,655
I think the feeling
that I had was the whole time

1135
01:19:26,762 --> 01:19:28,992
was the feeling of awe.

1136
01:19:29,097 --> 01:19:34,626
The Moon was the most spectacularly
beautiful desert you can ever imagine.

1137
01:19:34,736 --> 01:19:37,603
Unspoiled, untouched.

1138
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:42,835
It had a vibrancy about it

1139
01:19:42,945 --> 01:19:44,970
and the contrast between the Moon

1140
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:47,947
and the black sky was so vivid and...

1141
01:19:48,050 --> 01:19:50,848
It just made this impression, you know,

1142
01:19:50,952 --> 01:19:54,149
of excitement and wonder.

1143
01:20:01,228 --> 01:20:03,253
We were true scientific explorers.

1144
01:20:03,364 --> 01:20:06,390
We were looking at things
that human beings

1145
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:09,526
had never seen before
or if they had seen them,

1146
01:20:09,636 --> 01:20:11,604
they weren't thinking about them

1147
01:20:11,705 --> 01:20:13,400
in terms of understanding our Earth

1148
01:20:13,506 --> 01:20:15,838
and our solar system
and indeed the universe.

1149
01:20:20,046 --> 01:20:21,673
And that's what we were.
That's what we were doing.

1150
01:20:21,781 --> 01:20:23,408
We were scientific explorers

1151
01:20:23,516 --> 01:20:26,952
right from the moment
we stepped out of the spacecraft.

1152
01:20:30,657 --> 01:20:33,854
Roger, Dave. Let's do a little geology.

1153
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:36,451
Going to document the area first here, Joe.

1154
01:20:36,561 --> 01:20:39,359
If you come around there,

1155
01:20:39,465 --> 01:20:41,228
there's a rock in the
near field on this rim...

1156
01:20:41,333 --> 01:20:43,699
I'd like you to pick it up as a ground sample.

1157
01:20:45,137 --> 01:20:48,265
I say, John, just look at that footprint.

1158
01:20:48,374 --> 01:20:50,672
Look underneath that
when you picked that up.

1159
01:20:50,776 --> 01:20:53,939
...a centimetre or so under, it's white!

1160
01:20:54,046 --> 01:20:56,105
Absolutely white right here.

1161
01:20:56,215 --> 01:20:57,978
Gee, you got a bag?

1162
01:20:58,082 --> 01:21:00,209
All set.

1163
01:21:00,318 --> 01:21:01,785
Okay, I'm going to get the...

1164
01:21:01,886 --> 01:21:05,913
shadowed material...

1165
01:21:06,024 --> 01:21:09,551
Look, this is a real beauty!

1166
01:21:45,828 --> 01:21:48,228
I didn't have any great feeling of...

1167
01:21:48,330 --> 01:21:49,922
"Oh, we've done it!"

1168
01:21:50,032 --> 01:21:53,593
I mean, we've done part of it, but, uh...

1169
01:21:53,703 --> 01:21:57,537
I was a lot more worried, I guess,

1170
01:21:57,640 --> 01:21:59,835
about getting them up off the Moon

1171
01:21:59,942 --> 01:22:02,706
than I was about getting
them down onto the Moon.

1172
01:22:04,547 --> 01:22:09,075
The motor on the Lunar Module
was one motor

1173
01:22:09,184 --> 01:22:11,846
and if something went wrong with it,

1174
01:22:11,953 --> 01:22:13,921
you know, they were dead men,

1175
01:22:14,022 --> 01:22:17,219
there was no other way
for them to leave.

1176
01:22:20,261 --> 01:22:21,353
Ladies and gentlemen,

1177
01:22:21,463 --> 01:22:24,762
the President of the United States.

1178
01:22:24,866 --> 01:22:27,835
Good evening,
my fellow Americans.

1179
01:22:27,936 --> 01:22:29,665
Tonight, I want to talk to you

1180
01:22:29,770 --> 01:22:32,967
on a subject of deep concern
to all Americans

1181
01:22:33,073 --> 01:22:35,871
and to many people
in all parts of the world.

1182
01:22:35,976 --> 01:22:37,068
"Fate has ordained

1183
01:22:37,177 --> 01:22:40,078
that the men who went to the Moon
to explore in peace

1184
01:22:40,180 --> 01:22:43,581
will stay on the Moon to rest in peace.

1185
01:22:43,684 --> 01:22:47,313
These brave men,
Neil Armstrong and Edwin Aldrin,

1186
01:22:47,420 --> 01:22:50,321
know that there is no hope
for their recovery,

1187
01:22:50,424 --> 01:22:55,123
but they also know that there is
hope for Mankind In their sacrifice."

1188
01:22:56,996 --> 01:22:58,486
I mean, this is, you know...

1189
01:22:58,598 --> 01:23:02,056
What a public relations
person would have to say.

1190
01:23:04,570 --> 01:23:08,666
Nine, eight, seven, six, five...

1191
01:23:08,775 --> 01:23:12,176
Port stage, engine arm, ascent, proceed.

1192
01:23:18,550 --> 01:23:23,419
Beautiful.
26-36 feet per second up.

1193
01:23:23,522 --> 01:23:25,854
Pitchover.

1194
01:23:25,957 --> 01:23:27,447
Very smooth.

1195
01:23:29,194 --> 01:23:31,424
Balance couple, off.

1196
01:23:31,530 --> 01:23:33,555
Very quiet ride.

1197
01:23:38,135 --> 01:23:40,603
Eagle, Houston request
manual start override.

1198
01:23:43,808 --> 01:23:45,901
2600 feet altitude.

1199
01:23:48,446 --> 01:23:50,437
Eagle, Houston,
one minute. You are looking good.

1200
01:23:53,684 --> 01:23:55,675
Oh God, look... It's beautiful.

1201
01:23:55,786 --> 01:23:57,845
It's a beautiful little thing,
you see the L.M., you know,

1202
01:23:57,955 --> 01:24:00,423
a little golden bug down
there among the craters

1203
01:24:00,523 --> 01:24:03,890
and it gets slowly bigger and bigger.

1204
01:24:03,993 --> 01:24:07,429
They seem to be, you
know, like riding rails,

1205
01:24:07,531 --> 01:24:10,500
they were very precise.

1206
01:24:10,601 --> 01:24:16,699
And then it got right up next to me
and then it was my job, as before,

1207
01:24:16,806 --> 01:24:19,798
to make the connection
between the two vehicles.

1208
01:24:32,955 --> 01:24:35,981
Finally, they got back
into the command module

1209
01:24:36,091 --> 01:24:40,391
and I grabbed Buzz by both ears

1210
01:24:40,495 --> 01:24:42,520
and I was going to kiss
him on the forehead,

1211
01:24:42,631 --> 01:24:43,996
I can remember that.

1212
01:24:44,099 --> 01:24:45,862
and I got him to right about here

1213
01:24:45,967 --> 01:24:48,993
and I said, "That's not a very...

1214
01:24:49,103 --> 01:24:51,367
good thing to do somehow,"

1215
01:24:51,472 --> 01:24:54,202
so I forgot,
whether I clapped him on the back

1216
01:24:54,308 --> 01:24:55,935
or shook his hand or did something.

1217
01:24:56,043 --> 01:25:01,106
And again, you don't have time
to sit around and reminisce

1218
01:25:01,215 --> 01:25:03,649
because you've got T.E.I. coming up

1219
01:25:03,751 --> 01:25:06,948
in another... little while,

1220
01:25:07,054 --> 01:25:10,512
so you've got to get ready for that
and come home.

1221
01:25:21,167 --> 01:25:24,796
The biggest joy
was on the way home.

1222
01:25:26,873 --> 01:25:29,171
In my cockpit window, every two minutes,

1223
01:25:29,276 --> 01:25:31,676
the Earth, the Moon, the Sun

1224
01:25:31,777 --> 01:25:36,111
and a whole 360 degree
panorama of the heavens.

1225
01:25:36,215 --> 01:25:40,276
And that was a powerful,
overwhelming experience.

1226
01:25:41,987 --> 01:25:46,117
And suddenly I realized
that the molecules of my body

1227
01:25:46,225 --> 01:25:47,954
and the molecules of the spacecraft

1228
01:25:48,060 --> 01:25:50,756
and the molecules in the bodies
of my partners

1229
01:25:50,863 --> 01:25:54,492
were prototyped and manufactured

1230
01:25:54,599 --> 01:25:57,124
in some ancient generation of stars.

1231
01:26:01,306 --> 01:26:05,868
And that was an overwhelming sense
of oneness, of connectedness.

1232
01:26:05,977 --> 01:26:09,845
It wasn't them and us,
it was, "that's me, that's all of it,

1233
01:26:09,948 --> 01:26:12,439
it's one thing."

1234
01:26:12,550 --> 01:26:15,280
And it was accompanied by an ecstasy,

1235
01:26:15,386 --> 01:26:20,289
a sense of, "oh my God. wow, yes,"
an insight, an epiphany.

1236
01:26:43,478 --> 01:26:46,345
Re-entry is very critical on Apollo.

1237
01:26:46,449 --> 01:26:49,509
The last time I looked at my computer,

1238
01:26:49,618 --> 01:26:55,079
we were accelerating
through 39,000 feet per second,

1239
01:26:55,191 --> 01:27:00,026
which is... uh, translates
to over 26,000 miles an hour.

1240
01:27:00,129 --> 01:27:02,654
A rifle bullet only
goes 2000 miles an hour.

1241
01:27:05,934 --> 01:27:08,027
You are literally on fire.

1242
01:27:08,136 --> 01:27:11,537
Your heat shield is on fire
and it's streaming...

1243
01:27:11,638 --> 01:27:13,936
Its fragments are
streaming out behind you.

1244
01:27:15,777 --> 01:27:18,541
It's like being inside a gigantic light bulb.

1245
01:27:26,186 --> 01:27:29,121
The re-entry started at 400,000 feet,

1246
01:27:29,223 --> 01:27:31,282
and by the time you've got to 90,000 feet,

1247
01:27:31,392 --> 01:27:34,850
you're basically coming
straight down, freefall.

1248
01:27:40,234 --> 01:27:43,726
Well, then the final link
in the daisy chain is the...

1249
01:27:43,837 --> 01:27:45,327
is, well, there... Actually,

1250
01:27:45,439 --> 01:27:47,373
I guess I'd have to say
there may be two more,

1251
01:27:47,474 --> 01:27:50,443
but, uh... the important one
is that the parachutes open.

1252
01:27:54,447 --> 01:27:56,677
Mains coming out,
huge explosion again

1253
01:27:56,783 --> 01:27:58,216
and these three
chutes come out.

1254
01:28:07,260 --> 01:28:11,629
The three orange and
white spheres of reassurance.

1255
01:28:22,240 --> 01:28:23,298
That was the end.

1256
01:28:23,408 --> 01:28:24,636
That was the last of the daisy...

1257
01:28:24,743 --> 01:28:26,108
Well, then we had to get out.

1258
01:28:29,247 --> 01:28:31,340
I can remember the beautiful water.

1259
01:28:31,450 --> 01:28:34,613
You know, we were out in the deep
ocean in the Pacific.

1260
01:28:34,718 --> 01:28:38,176
It was such a startling violet colour.

1261
01:28:38,289 --> 01:28:40,314
I remember looking at
the ocean and admiring,

1262
01:28:40,424 --> 01:28:43,257
"Nice ocean you got here,
planet Earth."

1263
01:28:52,069 --> 01:28:53,866
To me, the marvel of it

1264
01:28:53,971 --> 01:28:57,873
is that it all worked like clockwork,

1265
01:28:57,974 --> 01:28:59,635
I almost said like magic.

1266
01:28:59,742 --> 01:29:04,304
There might be a little magic mixed up

1267
01:29:04,414 --> 01:29:06,245
in the back of that big clock somewhere...

1268
01:29:09,219 --> 01:29:12,620
Because everything worked
as it was supposed to.

1269
01:29:12,722 --> 01:29:14,087
Nobody messed up.

1270
01:29:14,190 --> 01:29:16,317
Even I didn't make mistakes.

1271
01:29:33,408 --> 01:29:37,310
I knew that anyone
who was on the first lunar landing

1272
01:29:37,412 --> 01:29:39,744
was certainly going to be propelled

1273
01:29:39,848 --> 01:29:42,612
into the public view in an enormous way.

1274
01:29:44,352 --> 01:29:46,843
That awareness was troublesome

1275
01:29:46,954 --> 01:29:48,922
and interfered during the mission.

1276
01:29:51,659 --> 01:29:55,925
But it's nothing like what happens
after the mission

1277
01:29:56,030 --> 01:29:58,726
and for the rest of your life.

1278
01:29:58,833 --> 01:30:01,063
You are the person now,

1279
01:30:01,169 --> 01:30:03,637
not just an average fighter pilot,

1280
01:30:03,738 --> 01:30:07,139
who did this and that pretty well,

1281
01:30:07,240 --> 01:30:09,504
but, "This guy walked on the Moon."

1282
01:30:09,609 --> 01:30:14,376
And now I have to sort of uphold that image

1283
01:30:14,481 --> 01:30:18,611
for the rest of my life, no matter what I do.

1284
01:30:22,088 --> 01:30:25,216
Can't think of a negative thing
about Neil Armstrong.

1285
01:30:25,325 --> 01:30:28,317
I think it's wonderful
that he's been the first man on the Moon.

1286
01:30:29,662 --> 01:30:31,653
Even though
he's somewhat reclusive,

1287
01:30:31,764 --> 01:30:34,528
then that helps to preserve the image.

1288
01:30:34,633 --> 01:30:36,191
That's a tough role.

1289
01:30:36,302 --> 01:30:38,361
I'm glad... I'd love to do that,

1290
01:30:38,470 --> 01:30:40,529
but I'd hate to try to fill that role.

1291
01:30:40,639 --> 01:30:42,106
That's a tough role.

1292
01:30:42,208 --> 01:30:44,233
Yeah... Boy!

1293
01:30:52,884 --> 01:30:54,784
After the flight of Apollo 11,

1294
01:30:54,886 --> 01:30:57,616
the three of us went
on an around-the-world trip.

1295
01:30:58,756 --> 01:31:01,020
Wherever we went,

1296
01:31:01,125 --> 01:31:04,390
people, instead of saying,
"Well, you Americans did it,"

1297
01:31:04,495 --> 01:31:06,156
Everywhere, they said, "We did it.

1298
01:31:06,264 --> 01:31:09,392
We Humankind, we the Human race,

1299
01:31:09,500 --> 01:31:10,990
we, people, did it."

1300
01:31:11,102 --> 01:31:15,300
And, I had never heard of, um...

1301
01:31:15,405 --> 01:31:19,603
people in different countries
use this word "We, we, we"

1302
01:31:19,710 --> 01:31:23,646
as emphatically as we were hearing

1303
01:31:23,747 --> 01:31:27,740
from Europeans, Asians, Africans...

1304
01:31:27,851 --> 01:31:30,319
Wherever we went,
it was, "We finally did it!"

1305
01:31:30,420 --> 01:31:32,251
And I thought that
was a wonderful thing.

1306
01:31:32,356 --> 01:31:34,847
Ephemeral, but wonderful.

1307
01:32:05,787 --> 01:32:08,881
I felt that I was
literally standing on a plateau

1308
01:32:08,990 --> 01:32:10,184
somewhere out there in space,

1309
01:32:10,292 --> 01:32:14,922
a plateau that science and technology
had allowed me to get to.

1310
01:32:15,030 --> 01:32:18,329
But now, what I was seeing
and even more important,

1311
01:32:18,433 --> 01:32:21,834
what I was feeling at
that moment in time,

1312
01:32:21,936 --> 01:32:25,064
science and technology
had no answers for.

1313
01:32:25,172 --> 01:32:26,332
Literally no answers,

1314
01:32:26,440 --> 01:32:31,036
because there I was
and there you are...

1315
01:32:32,212 --> 01:32:36,171
there you are,
the Earth, dynamic, overwhelming

1316
01:32:36,283 --> 01:32:39,741
and I felt that the world...
there's just too much purpose,

1317
01:32:39,853 --> 01:32:41,912
too much logic
and it was just too beautiful

1318
01:32:42,022 --> 01:32:43,649
to have happened by accident.

1319
01:32:43,757 --> 01:32:46,317
There has to be
somebody bigger than you

1320
01:32:46,426 --> 01:32:48,053
and bigger than me

1321
01:32:48,161 --> 01:32:51,756
and I mean this in a spiritual sense
not a religious sense.

1322
01:32:51,864 --> 01:32:54,492
There has to be
a creator of the universe

1323
01:32:54,600 --> 01:32:56,659
who stands above the religions

1324
01:32:56,769 --> 01:33:00,170
that we ourselves create to govern our lives.

1325
01:33:06,012 --> 01:33:12,110
A friend of ours got us
to go to a Bible study at a tennis club.

1326
01:33:12,217 --> 01:33:17,655
And after that weekend, I said to Jesus,
I said, "I give you my life

1327
01:33:17,756 --> 01:33:20,452
and if you're real, come into my life."

1328
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:24,360
And I believe and he did and I had...

1329
01:33:24,462 --> 01:33:27,397
I had this sense of peace

1330
01:33:27,499 --> 01:33:31,697
that was... that was hard to describe.

1331
01:33:33,738 --> 01:33:37,230
It was so dramatic
that we started sharing our story.

1332
01:33:40,344 --> 01:33:42,938
I say, my walk
on the Moon lasted three days

1333
01:33:43,047 --> 01:33:44,947
and it was a great adventure,

1334
01:33:45,049 --> 01:33:48,109
but my walk with God lasts forever.

1335
01:33:52,690 --> 01:33:55,124
I think if you do something

1336
01:33:55,225 --> 01:33:58,058
that's drastically different

1337
01:33:58,161 --> 01:34:01,221
like flying to the Moon
and coming back again,

1338
01:34:01,331 --> 01:34:03,799
everyone tells you how important it is,
how wonderful it is

1339
01:34:03,900 --> 01:34:05,868
and how important,
important, important.

1340
01:34:05,969 --> 01:34:09,336
Then by comparison a lot of other things

1341
01:34:09,439 --> 01:34:13,569
that used to seem important
don't seem quite as much so.

1342
01:34:13,676 --> 01:34:19,012
And I'm not saying that I'm able to face life

1343
01:34:19,114 --> 01:34:20,979
with greater equanimity

1344
01:34:21,083 --> 01:34:24,780
because I've flown to the Moon, but I try to.

1345
01:34:26,021 --> 01:34:28,717
And maybe some of our
terrestrial squabbles

1346
01:34:28,824 --> 01:34:32,089
don't seem as important
after having flown to the Moon

1347
01:34:32,194 --> 01:34:34,185
than they did before.

1348
01:34:36,965 --> 01:34:38,455
We learned a lot about the Moon

1349
01:34:38,567 --> 01:34:42,970
but what we really learned
was about the Earth.

1350
01:34:43,070 --> 01:34:47,268
The fact that just from
the distance of the Moon

1351
01:34:47,375 --> 01:34:48,899
you could put your thumb up,

1352
01:34:49,010 --> 01:34:51,672
and you can hide the
Earth behind your thumb.

1353
01:34:51,779 --> 01:34:54,475
Everything that you have ever known...

1354
01:34:54,582 --> 01:34:58,951
Your loved ones, your business,
the problems of the Earth itself,

1355
01:34:59,053 --> 01:35:01,647
all behind your thumb.

1356
01:35:01,756 --> 01:35:05,556
And how insignificant we really all are.

1357
01:35:05,659 --> 01:35:09,993
But then how fortunate we are
to have this body

1358
01:35:10,096 --> 01:35:14,055
and to be able to enjoy living here

1359
01:35:14,167 --> 01:35:19,662
amongst the beauty of the Earth itself.

1360
01:35:23,643 --> 01:35:25,474
It truly is an oasis

1361
01:35:25,578 --> 01:35:28,012
and we don't take very good care of it.

1362
01:35:28,113 --> 01:35:31,173
And I think the elevation of that awareness

1363
01:35:31,283 --> 01:35:35,379
is a real contribution to, you know,
saving the Earth, if you will.

1364
01:35:39,758 --> 01:35:42,226
Earth has changed a lot
since we started flying in Gemini.

1365
01:35:42,328 --> 01:35:45,024
There's a lot of things like urban pollution

1366
01:35:45,130 --> 01:35:47,530
and you can see that when you hit orbit now.

1367
01:35:47,633 --> 01:35:49,260
You can see the big cities

1368
01:35:49,367 --> 01:35:53,667
all have their own set of unique atmospheres,

1369
01:35:53,771 --> 01:35:54,897
They really do.

1370
01:35:56,875 --> 01:35:59,469
We ought to be looking out for our kids
and our grandkids

1371
01:35:59,578 --> 01:36:01,546
and what are we worried about?

1372
01:36:01,646 --> 01:36:04,409
The price of a gallon of gasoline,

1373
01:36:04,515 --> 01:36:08,076
you know, in the United States,
they're worried about $3 a gallon gas.

1374
01:36:08,186 --> 01:36:09,813
I said, that's awful, you know?

1375
01:36:12,689 --> 01:36:14,350
Since that time,

1376
01:36:14,458 --> 01:36:19,088
I have not complained
about the weather one single time.

1377
01:36:19,196 --> 01:36:21,096
I'm glad there is weather.

1378
01:36:21,198 --> 01:36:23,257
I've not complained about traffic,

1379
01:36:23,367 --> 01:36:24,959
I'm glad there's people around.

1380
01:36:25,068 --> 01:36:27,093
One of the things that I did when I got home,

1381
01:36:27,204 --> 01:36:30,970
I went down to shopping centres
and I'd just go around there,

1382
01:36:31,074 --> 01:36:34,532
get an ice cream cone or something
and just watch the people go by

1383
01:36:34,644 --> 01:36:37,636
and think, "Boy, we're lucky to be here,

1384
01:36:37,747 --> 01:36:40,648
why do people complain about the Earth?"

1385
01:36:40,750 --> 01:36:43,082
We are living in the Garden of Eden!

1386
01:36:46,756 --> 01:36:49,088
As I look back, if I use one word,

1387
01:36:49,191 --> 01:36:50,590
I would use the word "luck".

1388
01:36:50,693 --> 01:36:53,059
I just feel very lucky.

1389
01:36:53,162 --> 01:36:55,995
You know, Neil Armstrong
was born in 1930,

1390
01:36:56,098 --> 01:36:58,362
Buzz Aldrin was born in 1930,

1391
01:36:58,466 --> 01:37:00,957
Mike Collins was born in 1930.

1392
01:37:01,069 --> 01:37:03,037
I mean how lucky can you get?

1393
01:37:03,138 --> 01:37:07,006
We just happened along at the right time.

1394
01:37:07,108 --> 01:37:10,669
I feel blessed every single day.

1395
01:37:10,779 --> 01:37:15,273
Not a day goes by
that I don't think, "This is great,

1396
01:37:15,383 --> 01:37:18,784
this was wonderful..."

1397
01:37:18,887 --> 01:37:22,755
Somebody had to go
and they happened to pick me,

1398
01:37:22,856 --> 01:37:24,153
so it is great.

1399
01:37:52,819 --> 01:37:55,253
You know, some of the tabloids

1400
01:37:55,355 --> 01:37:59,086
are saying that we did this
In a hanger in Arizona.

1401
01:37:59,192 --> 01:38:01,092
Maybe that would have been a good idea!

1402
01:38:01,194 --> 01:38:02,821
I don't know how I would...

1403
01:38:02,929 --> 01:38:05,420
grab someone by the collar
who didn't believe,

1404
01:38:05,529 --> 01:38:07,224
and shake them
and somehow change their mind.

1405
01:38:07,332 --> 01:38:09,323
Any significant event in history,

1406
01:38:09,433 --> 01:38:12,334
somebody's had a conspiracy theory
one way or the other.

1407
01:38:12,437 --> 01:38:16,237
I don't know two Americans
who have a fantastic secret

1408
01:38:16,341 --> 01:38:18,571
without one of them
blurting it out to the Press!

1409
01:38:18,677 --> 01:38:23,307
Can you imagine thousands of people
able to keep this secret?

1410
01:38:23,415 --> 01:38:26,145
We've been to the Moon nine times.

1411
01:38:26,251 --> 01:38:30,381
I mean, why did we fake it nine times...

1412
01:38:30,488 --> 01:38:31,853
If we faked it?

1413
01:38:31,956 --> 01:38:35,915
Truth needs no defence.

1414
01:38:36,027 --> 01:38:39,121
Nobody, nobody...

1415
01:38:39,230 --> 01:38:44,190
Can ever take those footsteps I made
on the surface of the Moon away from me.
