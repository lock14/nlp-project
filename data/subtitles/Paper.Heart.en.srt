1
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:21,477
Has anyone been in love?

2
00:00:22,606 --> 00:00:24,972
Have you ever been in love?

3
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:39,570
There's not a soul in the world
that wants to talk to me.

4
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:46,007
Whoo! Viva Las Vegas!
Whoo!

5
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:48,920
That's funny.

6
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:51,043
- What you got there, honey?
- It's a microphone.

7
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:52,965
Is it?
What do you want me to say?

8
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,918
- You look good.
- Oh, thank you.

9
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:56,423
You don't know what love is?

10
00:00:56,515 --> 00:00:57,504
No.

11
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:59,055
Oh, well, that's a shame.

12
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:00,848
Are you looking for love?

13
00:01:00,936 --> 00:01:02,927
No, not really.
I'm kind of content.

14
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:04,886
I like all these backup people
you got here.

15
00:01:04,982 --> 00:01:05,937
Thanks.

16
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:07,764
There's tons of guys out here.

17
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:10,066
If you go out here,
you can find your soulmate.

18
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:12,109
I just think
love is a hard thing to find.

19
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:14,313
When you find it, keep it.
Hold on to it.

20
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:18,779
- Love?
- Love?

21
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,826
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I love LA.

22
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,996
Is love a good thing?

23
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,540
Yeah, a very good thing.

24
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:27,538
Cool.

25
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:29,415
Cool. Thank you.

26
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:30,621
Thank you.

27
00:01:30,716 --> 00:01:32,377
- Bye.
- Bye.

28
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:48,389
Ladies and gentlemen,
Charlyne Yi!

29
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:54,478
Argh!

30
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:57,280
Argh! Argh!

31
00:01:57,367 --> 00:02:00,279
Charlyne Yi!
Charlyne Yi!

32
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:04,613
Charlyne Yi!

33
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:15,920
I do.

34
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,965
So you say you don't believe
in love now,

35
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:22,093
but have you always
felt that way?

36
00:02:22,184 --> 00:02:24,425
I believed in it
when I was a kid,

37
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:27,056
but again, all my ideas
about love

38
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,354
kind of came from movies
and fairy tales.

39
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:31,648
And as I grew up I realized

40
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:34,852
that life is nothing like that.

41
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:36,857
Was that 'cause you had
your heart broken?

42
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:39,439
No.
I've only ever had one boyfriend.

43
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:42,992
I thought I really liked him.
I thought he was all dark and mysterious

44
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,911
and he had shadows
under his eyes.

45
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:48,240
But then I realized that was only
because he was on drugs.

46
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,200
Hey, Gill, this is Nick.

47
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:52,707
We're making a documentary
about Charlyne and love.

48
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:55,255
We were wondering if we could
ask you some questions.

49
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:57,583
Awesome.

50
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:00,760
Do you think
I'll learn something?

51
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:04,802
Do you think
it's possible?

52
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:07,805
Why?

53
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:19,605
You're probably thinking,
"Is this how Charlyne really is?"

54
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,908
This hair... it's a wig.
It's not my hair.

55
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:27,196
Made you think it was a wig.

56
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,246
Made you think it wasn't my hair.

57
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:35,708
Looks nothing like that.

58
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:37,915
So you don't know what love is.

59
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:40,591
You've never felt it, so you claim.

60
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:44,217
And you also know for sure
that you will never be in love.

61
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:47,390
- Yeah.
- I'm dumbfounded.

62
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,559
I've never been in love, ever,

63
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:52,308
so I'm not sure
if I'm capable of it.

64
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:54,765
Well, why do you think
that you would be someone

65
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,191
who wasn't capable of it?

66
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:58,109
You're a very loving person.

67
00:03:58,196 --> 00:03:59,527
That's what you think.

68
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:02,777
You're dedicated to creative things.
There's passion inside you.

69
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:05,109
Your love glass is half full.

70
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,616
You're very optimistic.

71
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:10,572
- You've never been in love?
- No.

72
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,909
And it's...

73
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:15,869
This is gonna come out,
probably, wrong,

74
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:18,876
but is it because
you're not lovable?

75
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,674
You think I'm not lovable,
Demetri?

76
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:24,970
No, I'm asking, do you feel not lovable?
Do you feel not valuable?

77
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:27,763
'Cause I think
you're potentially valuable.

78
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:30,843
I think if Charlyne ever falls in love

79
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:33,553
- she'll keep it very close to herself.
- Yeah, private.

80
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:36,560
I don't think she's gonna make it
public to anybody.

81
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,642
Do you think that Charlyne
believes in love

82
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:41,103
even though she says she doesn't?

83
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:46,108
You think Charlyne will ever
find love?

84
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,620
I hope so too.

85
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:59,163
Bye, Gill.

86
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:02,169
So why do you want to make
a documentary about love then?

87
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,343
Well, I think everyone means
something to someone.

88
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,421
And we're all a bit skeptical,

89
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:10,679
but I don't want to end up
a lonely old spinster.

90
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:12,350
I don't think anyone wants to.

91
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:15,725
So we're gonna go on the road
and talk to people and hear their stories

92
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:18,182
and see if that changes
the way you think about love.

93
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:20,858
-  Yep, we'll see.
- That's right. We will see.

94
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:30,030
Have you ever
been married?

95
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:33,204
Yes, I was married for 11 years.

96
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,202
And then I got divorced.

97
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:37,249
And it was the first time
I was married too.

98
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,293
I didn't get married
till I was 43 years old.

99
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:42,123
I met this young lady
and we got married.

100
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:44,458
And then, eh,

101
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:46,509
she just didn't want
to be married anymore.

102
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:49,178
I don't understand it,

103
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:51,382
but, you know, she had to do
what was best for her.

104
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,558
And why wouldn't you
get married again?

105
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:59,265
Because I don't want
to go through the hurt again.

106
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,350
When I took those vows,

107
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:05,187
for me it was for life,
you know, as far as I was concerned.

108
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:08,194
But it wasn't.

109
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:11,618
People fall out of love.
People change.

110
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:14,538
And what they want
and what the other person wants...

111
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,580
it's just different.

112
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:18,624
Rack 'em up.

113
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:20,668
We're tied.

114
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:23,417
When you get older,
you have all this experience

115
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:25,965
and then you start thinking about,
you know, your past loves.

116
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,714
And true love is
a whole different thing.

117
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:31,672
That only comes once in a while...

118
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:34,098
once in a lifetime, I think.

119
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:36,346
- Have you had that?
- Yes, I have.

120
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:38,429
Was that with your ex-wife?

121
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:40,605
No, as a matter of fact.

122
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:44,810
It was... God, it must be,
like, 20 years ago,

123
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:47,772
but every time I hear her name

124
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:51,029
immediately the image of her
pops in my head

125
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:53,656
and I get those little butterflies
and everything like that.

126
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,658
Why didn't it work out?

127
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,785
She was dating somebody else
at the time

128
00:06:57,876 --> 00:06:59,992
and she just...
she was, like, this close

129
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:03,795
to giving it up
and being with me,

130
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:06,123
and she just couldn't do it.

131
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:08,879
And did you know she was
dating someone at the time?

132
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,710
Yeah, but what does that matter?

133
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:14,468
If they're not married or engaged,
they're fair game.

134
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:16,925
- You think so?
- You know what I mean? Yeah.

135
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,885
I mean, it's just a boyfriend.

136
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:22,097
'Cause, I mean, you could be
the one she's really looking for, right?

137
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:24,183
But I think the problem
with true love is

138
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:27,064
that it has to be
on both sides.

139
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:29,271
That's what makes it
so difficult.

140
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:31,072
Like she might have been
my true love,

141
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:34,367
but maybe I wasn't her true love.

142
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:39,489
See, you got me talking about love
and I can't even shoot pool anymore.

143
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:43,202
While we're talking about love
and true love,

144
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,628
how do you know
if you ever found love?

145
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:48,331
Well, I'll tell you
a little story.

146
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:53,011
Last May I took a trip up to Alaska
to go grizzly hunting.

147
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:55,589
and I was 130 miles north
of the Arctic Circle

148
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:58,016
on horseback for two weeks.

149
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:00,685
And it was just me, my guide
and my wrangler.

150
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:09,899
So we were riding along
and we had to cross this river.

151
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,946
And it was late spring,

152
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:14,991
so the water was very very high

153
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:17,239
and very very cold.

154
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,072
There were big chunks of ice
in the river

155
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,373
and it was freezing.

156
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,542
So anyway, we were crossing
this river

157
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,711
and I almost made it
to the other side

158
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:29,835
when my horse lost its footing
and rolled,

159
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,212
and me and the horse
went down the river.

160
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,344
The water was moving
really really fast.

161
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:38,515
It overtook me
and it held me under the water

162
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:42,059
for a good 30 seconds...
45 seconds.

163
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:44,388
And I remember it being
very serene,

164
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:46,393
a very pretty color.

165
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:48,896
And I was just floating there,
like in space.

166
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:53,279
And I was saying to myself,
"I can't die like this.

167
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,027
This isn't the way to go."

168
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:57,359
And then all of a sudden

169
00:08:57,454 --> 00:09:00,491
I saw Sarah's face...
my ex-wife.

170
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:06,001
And she didn't say anything to me.
She didn't look at me.

171
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:09,875
And that's when I started
reaching for it

172
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:12,207
and I power-swam to the top

173
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:14,258
and popped out of the top
of the river,

174
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:16,836
grabbed onto a little branch
and got out.

175
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:20,765
And my guide had
a big bonfire going.

176
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:24,390
And I'm here to tell the story,
so obviously I survived.

177
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:27,268
But the point of the story is

178
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:31,601
that the love from that marriage
was still there.

179
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:35,780
And when I came home
I told Sarah the story

180
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:37,778
and she said that she was
sitting there

181
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:39,780
working on her computer,

182
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:41,827
and that's the profile
I would have seen

183
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:44,247
of her just sitting there
at her desk.

184
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:47,417
And like I was saying before
about the one true love

185
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:49,210
that might have been,

186
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:52,164
I didn't see her face
when I was almost dying,

187
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:55,295
but it was Sarah's face
that I saw.

188
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:58,628
So going back and looking at that,

189
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:01,430
maybe she was
the true one love.

190
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:05,181
And I guess
I'll just never know.

191
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:15,487
So what's gonna be
your opening question?

192
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:18,531
"What's your name?"

193
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:21,826
Hello, Charlyne. I'm Professor Bill Hase
of Texas Tech University.

194
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:22,993
Hi.

195
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:24,992
Let's talk about
what love is first.

196
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,745
Love is, I guess,
an affection towards somebody

197
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:30,669
and it's a feeling
that's a pleasant feeling.

198
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:33,292
And chemists would say

199
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:36,500
that something's being triggered
in terms of molecules interacting.

200
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:38,926
- In my brain?
- In the brain.

201
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:41,720
Yeah, love is not here,
even though we have it there... the heart.

202
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:44,015
It's actually going on
right up here.

203
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:47,515
The biochemist, or the anatomist
and physiologist

204
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:48,845
would say things like,

205
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,181
"Well, as we fall in love, we know,
we've recorded

206
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:55,019
that there's additional serotonin release
in neurons in the brain.

207
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:57,980
We know that there's endorphins
that help us to feel better."

208
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:02,317
And we feel this euphoria
when we're falling in love.

209
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:04,448
In fact, sometimes so much so,
it's almost similar

210
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:07,155
to a drug-induced sort of state
where we may not even be using

211
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,491
rational behaviors
and things like that.

212
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:13,374
Do you think some people
can be born without those chemicals?

213
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:15,750
I think, not the chemicals

214
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:18,379
but the processing of them...
that's exactly right.

215
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:22,257
But I think it would not be unusual
or abnormal to think

216
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,964
that there are some people...
the chemistry is such

217
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:29,553
that it's difficult for them
to love someone else.

218
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,603
I wonder if that's
what's wrong with me.

219
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:34,103
Oh, I don't think so.

220
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:37,402
You seem like a very
pleasant person, right?

221
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:39,399
If love is such a strong emotion...

222
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:43,733
probably because it provides us
with something good.

223
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,910
How does that benefit us
evolutionarily?

224
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:47,362
Offspring.

225
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:49,243
It's kind of hard to tell...

226
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:51,746
do we really perceive
that what we're trying to do

227
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:54,077
is to successfully rear offspring,

228
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:57,460
or do we view love
as the end-all and be-all?

229
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,666
There are plenty of couples

230
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:02,093
who love each other
very much

231
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,716
who don't have
kids of their own.

232
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,762
- Yeah.
- And they stay married

233
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:09,092
even though they know for them
there's no reproductive benefit.

234
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,762
You know, I'd also want
to be careful

235
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:16,190
not to get so scientific

236
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:18,518
that we forget about just the pure joy

237
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:21,821
and maybe the mystical
aspects of love.

238
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:24,274
There's something...
there is something there.

239
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:26,155
There may be evolutionary
mechanisms

240
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:28,237
and there are certainly
biochemical mechanisms,

241
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:30,617
but somehow

242
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:34,075
there's a little bit of magic to it too.

243
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:44,211
- Hey.
- Nice to see you.

244
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:50,134
I always think that if I was in love
I would be married by now.

245
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:51,593
But I'm not.

246
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:53,428
Well, have you ever said
"I love you" to somebody?

247
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:55,809
I'm pretty quick to say "I love you"

248
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,812
just 'cause I feel like
I don't want them to run away.

249
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,439
Really?

250
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,816
- Yeah, I fell like...
- Does it work or does it scare them?

251
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,943
Well, I'm single, so I don't know.

252
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,320
What are you guys filming?

253
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:12,576
A documentary.

254
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:13,952
What is it about?

255
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,499
It's about me.

256
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,622
Your life?

257
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:20,296
No, it's about
how I don't believe in love.

258
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:22,840
Cool. Awesome.

259
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:25,009
Are you interviewing people
tonight for it?

260
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:27,087
- Or what are you filming tonight?
- Some people.

261
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:28,466
Oh, nice.

262
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:29,923
Do you want to be
interviewed, Mike?

263
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:31,974
No. Will this be in the movie...
this scene?

264
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,517
- Probably not.
- Yeah.

265
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,558
How long have you played
guitar for?

266
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,355
How do you know I play guitar?

267
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:39,774
You don't play?

268
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:41,351
I do.

269
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:42,936
I thought you did.

270
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:45,946
Well, how have you been, man?

271
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:47,865
Good. I'm glad you're here.
It's good to see you.

272
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:50,113
- It's really good seeing you.
- Yeah, I haven't seen you

273
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:52,195
since probably when we were
playing Frisbee.

274
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,872
I don't think I've played
since we played.

275
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,915
Yeah, this is cool.
How do you guys know each other?

276
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:59,119
I saw her do a show about,
probably, a year ago,

277
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:01,625
- and we just started hanging out.
- Started talking? Cool.

278
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:03,456
She's cool, man.
How do you know Chuck?

279
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:07,008
I don't... I've never...
I only met her just now, tonight, yeah.

280
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,757
- Do I have any advice for you?
- Yeah.

281
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:11,214
Yes. Every time you meet a boy
look him in the eyes.

282
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:13,550
- Okay.
- Because when you meet the guy,

283
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:15,054
when you meet
the love of your life,

284
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:16,807
you look him in the eyes,
you'll know right away.

285
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:19,014
I don't know.
I don't know if I can like anyone.

286
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,188
Really?

287
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:23,564
I mean, I've had crushes, but I don't
know if I can genuinely like someone.

288
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:26,896
I think first I have to like someone
and then see if I could fall in love.

289
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:29,073
- Do you like spooning?
- What's that?

290
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:39,617
# Waiting for you #

291
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:44,081
# I'll always be your friend. #

292
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:49,002
Hey, Charlyne.

293
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:50,758
Hey, Charlyne.

294
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:53,590
- Do you want to play guitar?
- Uh...

295
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:55,720
Play one song.
Come on, don't be shy.

296
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:58,554
I'm not. I'm scared.

297
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:04,605
What's the movie gonna be like,
funny?

298
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:06,276
- Well, we'll see, man.
- Romantic?

299
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:08,025
- Yeah, we'll see. It's basically...
- Quirky?

300
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:09,276
- Yeah.
- A quirky comedy?

301
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:11,278
Yeah, it's like...
it's a really quirky comedy,

302
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:13,405
- a real quirky comedy, man.
- That's perfect.

303
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:16,283
- I mean, the whole idea...
- That's just what America needs.

304
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:19,662
The whole idea is she said
that she doesn't believe that love exists.

305
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,037
- Yeah. I like your coat.
- And so...

306
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:23,290
Thanks, man.
I got it at Burlington Coat Factory.

307
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:26,123
It's nice. That's the kind of coat
that will last you, like, 50 years.

308
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:28,799
You know what I'm actually gonna do
with this, man? I'm gonna dry-clean it.

309
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:31,798
Yeah, you need to respect
your clothes.

310
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:33,504
That's a nice pair.

311
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,466
Thanks, man. You got a nice pair on too.
I was noticing the pattern.

312
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:38,893
So Charlyne... I'm pretty interested
in Charlyne.

313
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,722
She's pretty fascinating.

314
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:44,148
- Do you know her very well?
- I don't think so.

315
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:46,817
I think I know her more
than most people know her, but...

316
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:48,735
She's pretty mysterious.

317
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:51,530
Yeah, she's pretty mysterious.
You guys are similar like that.

318
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:54,074
- You guys are a pretty good match.
- I really like her.

319
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:56,403
I told you he likes you.

320
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:59,660
But he didn't even talk to me. He doesn't
even know me. How could he like me?

321
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,992
You guys talked a little bit. I mean,
he just said you seemed really cool.

322
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:06,545
He could just be a friend,
but if he calls I'd say give the guy a shot.

323
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,544
Well, if I see a number I don't recognize
I'm not gonna answer it.

324
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,500
I'll tell him to call back.

325
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:14,338
I'll just turn off my phone.

326
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:16,343
Well, he's a very nice guy.

327
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:17,924
And that's true.

328
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:20,385
And you guys are a good match.

329
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:35,195
- Hey, how are you? I'm Nick.
- How's it going?

330
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:37,698
- Nick, Brendan. Nice to meet you.
- This is Charlyne; Charlyne, Brendan.

331
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:40,621
Nice to meet you.
So what up, man? What are we doing?

332
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,074
So here's what we're thinking.
We would love to get inside,

333
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:45,376
kind of get set up
and then she'll ask you some questions

334
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:47,749
- and whatever comes out, comes out.
- Okay, cool. Come on in.

335
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,047
Perfect. Thank you.

336
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:52,341
What's happening, Jack?
How are you?

337
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:53,964
- How's it going?
- Good good.

338
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:56,888
- We put it up there just as a joke.
- That's your forehead.

339
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:58,930
They superimposed it. I know.
There was a guest...

340
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,883
they go, "Can you hold my baby?"
So I held the baby

341
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:03,219
and our photographer superimposed
my glasses and my head.

342
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:05,475
It looks sick.
It looks like some weird doll.

343
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:07,522
- Yeah, I was like...
- If the family ever saw it

344
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:09,396
they'd be like, "What did you do
to my daughter?"

345
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:12,069
Valentine's Day,
New Year's Eve, Christmas,

346
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:14,021
Thanksgiving, Fourth of July...

347
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,232
all the time people come here
to get married...

348
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:19,410
sometimes 10 a day,
sometimes five a day,

349
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:21,533
at least 300 a month.

350
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:23,956
Do you have any favorite stories
from working here?

351
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:28,002
I've been here 491/2 years
at the Little White Chapel

352
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:29,750
and do I have favorite stories?

353
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,001
Every one of them is a favorite story to me.

354
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:34,800
Everybody that gets married here

355
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,423
is very very special.

356
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:38,674
We had this guy,
and what he did was

357
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:41,633
when he was asked "Do you take
this bride to be your lawful wedded wife?"

358
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:44,594
he took this coin out
and he flicked this coin

359
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:47,180
and he went..."I do."

360
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:49,266
- Wasn't that funny?
- Yeah, that was funny.

361
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,897
And I thought,
"You're in so much trouble."

362
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:54,775
He is still suffering
to this day for that one, you know.

363
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:56,105
But he thought it was funny.

364
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,907
Two weeks ago a guy comes in.
He goes, "Elvis, come here."

365
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:01,281
He calls me up to the front.
He goes...

366
00:18:01,372 --> 00:18:03,283
I go, "Where's your bride?"
He goes, "In the bathroom.

367
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:05,330
But come here, I got a problem."
I go, "What's the problem?"

368
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:08,626
He goes, "I don't know her last name."
I said, "You don't know whose last name?"

369
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:11,750
He's like, "My bride."
I said, "You don't know her last name?

370
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:13,251
How long have you been together?"

371
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:15,378
When I saw him look at his watch
I thought, "Here we go."

372
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:19,337
He goes, "About 21/2 hours."
I said, "Sir, that's a minor detail.

373
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:21,548
You learn that on the honeymoon.
Right now you get married

374
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:23,553
and you'll deal with the small stuff
like the last name later."

375
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:25,976
As long as the check clears...
hey hey!

376
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:28,975
Thank you very much. No.

377
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:31,432
So when you get married
would you like to come here?

378
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:35,190
If I get married.
If I find somebody.

379
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:38,239
What would you like?
Just pretend you're getting married.

380
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:40,362
Just pretend
I'm getting married?

381
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:42,193
- I like that one that you pulled out.
- This one?

382
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:44,495
- Yeah.
- Are you gonna try that one on?

383
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:46,117
- Okay.
- Come on.

384
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:57,416
Congratulations.

385
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:58,967
- Thank you.
- Nice to see you.

386
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:00,511
All you have to remember
is "I do,"

387
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:03,055
and then "Yes, dear,"
for the rest of your life, okay?

388
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:08,435
All rise for the bride.

389
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:27,239
Thank you.
You can be seated.

390
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,699
By the powers vested in me
by the State of Nevada,

391
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:32,661
and as minister of the
Wee Kirk o' the Heather Wedding Chapel,

392
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:36,213
I now pronounce you and present you
as husband and wife.

393
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,542
And, Chuck, here's the best part...
you may kiss your bride.

394
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:15,162
Love is 30 minutes
in bed with a Harley.

395
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:18,506
Hey, you ever drink a Jägerbomb?

396
00:20:18,591 --> 00:20:19,831
You drink enough of these...

397
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:23,260
you'll wake up with an ugly girl
and be happy.

398
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:29,350
They come here every day.
It's a love of friendship.

399
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:31,473
These people will
go out of their way.

400
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:34,431
If you need a motorcycle part
and I got it, I'm gonna give it to you.

401
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:37,938
I'm gonna go in my tool bag
and I'm gonna give you the tool.

402
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:39,984
I'll give you what I got.

403
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:43,564
I'm not asking nothing for it,
but next time you see me messed up

404
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,490
you're gonna help me.

405
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:48,285
It's a love
that's better than family,

406
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:50,408
'cause most of my family's here.

407
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,956
Thanksgiving dinner is here.

408
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:56,376
Christmas dinner is here.

409
00:20:56,464 --> 00:20:58,420
And that's true love right there.

410
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:00,668
- That's what love is here.
- We love each other.

411
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,797
Sometimes we can't stand each other,
but we love each other.

412
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:07,130
We fight and cuss one another,

413
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:08,964
but we all love
one another here.

414
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:11,300
Yeah, I love you too.

415
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:13,386
So that's the kind of love
you need to know.

416
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:16,018
Love to other people
that don't know bikers

417
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,474
is different.

418
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:21,481
I love my wife, but if you ask
anybody around here,

419
00:21:21,573 --> 00:21:23,154
I treat her like shit.

420
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,481
Yeah, he does.

421
00:21:25,577 --> 00:21:28,819
When I stop picking on her,
she gets worried.

422
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:30,574
I don't know nothing
about relationships.

423
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:33,781
I know I love my wife.
We have a love-hate relationship...

424
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:36,993
I love to beat her;
she hates the beatings.

425
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:39,874
That's a joke.

426
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:42,172
So do you believe in love now?

427
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:44,841
- Uh, no no.
- No?

428
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:47,420
Are you ready to go
for that motorcycle ride?

429
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:48,504
Really?

430
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:49,634
- Let's go.
- Okay.

431
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:53,309
You might accidentally get out
there and fall in love with old Jester.

432
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:55,681
Okay.

433
00:21:57,858 --> 00:21:59,564
- No.
- Chuck, hold on tight.

434
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:01,358
Please, God, let me live.

435
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:16,165
- I lived.
- You probably have bugs in your...

436
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:19,369
I've never seen her smile so big.
You just made her world.

437
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:22,421
What do you think?
You want to ride a Harley now?

438
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:24,669
- Yeah, I want to get one.
- Tattoos and shit too?

439
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,920
Yeah.

440
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:31,138
Come on.

441
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:34,388
Who are you instant-messaging with?

442
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:36,469
Michael.

443
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:42,141
Michael Cera?

444
00:22:42,236 --> 00:22:44,318
Yep.

445
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:49,949
What are you and Michael Cera
instant-messaging about?

446
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:53,823
He says... I don't know,
he's being annoying.

447
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:57,702
He said if I wanted to elope
and I said...

448
00:22:57,793 --> 00:22:59,329
He asked if you wanted to elope?

449
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:02,287
"No, I don't know you."

450
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:04,417
That's pretty cool.

451
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:06,464
Why is it pretty cool?

452
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:08,542
I didn't know you and Mike
were kind of like that.

453
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,423
I thought you guys were more
just friends.

454
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:13,256
What?
I didn't do anything.

455
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,306
I didn't ask him to get married.
I just said...

456
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,510
Easy easy.
I'll drop it. I'll drop it.

457
00:23:23,611 --> 00:23:26,853
- Well, we're here at the Los Angeles Zoo...
- Zoo.

458
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:29,814
Because Charlyne...

459
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:33,993
...had a brilliant idea to come here
and hopefully capture

460
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:37,242
how animals express
their version of love.

461
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:40,075
How do you think we're gonna
go about doing that?

462
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:42,125
Do you have any ideas
what the scenes are gonna be?

463
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:45,124
Yeah, I'm gonna stay far
and watch from a distance

464
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:46,921
so I don't interrupt.

465
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:50,046
So we're at the zoo observing Charlyne
observing the animals, right?

466
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:51,627
Yes.

467
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:56,010
Wow, they're so in love.

468
00:23:57,311 --> 00:23:59,973
I see movement.
They're breathing.

469
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:04,018
All right, Chuck,
you want to wrap it up, dude?

470
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:06,976
Now I'm not sure exactly
what they're talking about.

471
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:08,811
- Hey, there's Mike.
- One can...

472
00:24:08,906 --> 00:24:11,272
Hey, Ben, you want to grab Mike
coming up too?

473
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:14,780
Hey.

474
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,826
- Hey, man.
- Hey, man.

475
00:24:16,914 --> 00:24:19,246
- What's up?
- Good seeing you.

476
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:21,494
- How's it going?
- Everybody remembers Mike?

477
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:23,667
- Hey.
- You remember Charlyne, of course.

478
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:29,248
- How's it going?
- Good, man. Thanks for making it out.

479
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:31,459
You guys have been getting
some lion footage?

480
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:34,135
Yeah, I'm just looking at them.

481
00:24:34,223 --> 00:24:36,885
He's being trying to make love to Cookie,
and she's not that interested.

482
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:40,184
Oh, yeah? That's too bad.
I know how that goes.

483
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:45,097
Um, I don't want to interrupt.

484
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:46,932
- Well, hang back.
- Yeah, keep going.

485
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:49,518
Do you want to just do one more
and we'll go see the chimps?

486
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:55,532
Uh, well, where were we, guys?

487
00:24:55,618 --> 00:24:57,904
So you guys have been looking
at these lions for a while?

488
00:24:57,997 --> 00:24:59,407
Yeah, about 45 minutes.

489
00:24:59,499 --> 00:25:01,615
- They've just been lying there?
- Yeah.

490
00:25:01,709 --> 00:25:03,950
- So this is a deleted scene.
- Yeah.

491
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:05,909
- This will never be in the movie.
- Yeah, right.

492
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:12,541
I see why people put chimps
on gift cards and things.

493
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:15,127
And I want to think of, like,
a clever thing to say

494
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:18,009
about how his legs are crossed,
like, "Working on my novel."

495
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,807
I want to put that on a gift card.

496
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:23,727
We're not
doing anything, are we?

497
00:25:23,814 --> 00:25:25,850
No, I think we're just
getting a B-roll.

498
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:28,023
Cool. Do you mind
if we just take a snack break?

499
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,771
No, take your time.

500
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:31,773
- Are you getting food?
- A snack break.

501
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:33,900
- Yeah, I'll go.
- Okay.

502
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:36,232
I'm gonna get some food too.
I haven't eaten.

503
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:38,738
Anything all day?

504
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:40,239
No, just this water.

505
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:42,571
Is it delicious?

506
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:45,908
Yeah, just not as filling
as one might hope.

507
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:52,873
What if you moved
a little bit more that way,

508
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:55,505
so everything she says you get
the giraffes in the background too?

509
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:58,382
Guys, sorry, I'm gonna go.
I'm gonna take off.

510
00:25:58,474 --> 00:26:00,260
- You're taking off?
- Yeah yeah, bye, guys.

511
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,432
- Thanks for coming by, man.
- Yeah, no problem. Bye.

512
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:04,430
I'll call you tomorrow
about the weekend.

513
00:26:04,522 --> 00:26:06,513
Okay.

514
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:09,932
What's going on this weekend?

515
00:26:10,027 --> 00:26:13,064
We're gonna go eat
and watch a movie.

516
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:15,191
You and Mike are gonna
go eat and watch a movie?

517
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:17,068
- Yeah.
- Just the two of you?

518
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:18,695
- Yeah.
- For real?

519
00:26:18,786 --> 00:26:19,946
What?

520
00:26:20,037 --> 00:26:21,993
That's awesome.
You guys are going on a date.

521
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:24,788
No, It's not a date.
We're just gonna hang out and eat.

522
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:26,991
You guys are gonna go eat,
the two of you, and go see a movie,

523
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:28,576
just the two of you,
and that's not a date?

524
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,956
No. We eat and watch movies
all the time.

525
00:26:31,048 --> 00:26:33,790
That's different.
Jay, a guy and a girl decide to go out

526
00:26:33,884 --> 00:26:35,966
and get dinner and see a movie?
What would you call that?

527
00:26:36,053 --> 00:26:38,669
- That would be a date, sir.
- That'd be a date.

528
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:42,052
Let's try to get that date out of your head
and just shoot this scene.

529
00:26:43,561 --> 00:26:46,303
- Can I have this?
- Yeah.

530
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:49,138
You can have as many
as you want, incidentally.

531
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:51,394
- Do you want this one?
- No.

532
00:26:51,485 --> 00:26:53,601
- You can have it.
- No, your finger's been...

533
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:55,481
Here.

534
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:56,937
No, don't.

535
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:03,578
So are you from LA?

536
00:27:03,664 --> 00:27:06,622
No.

537
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:08,664
I'm from Fontana.

538
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:11,960
It's an hour and a half
away from here.

539
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:14,504
You from LA?

540
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:16,547
No, I'm from Toronto.

541
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:18,500
Cool.

542
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:21,007
Do you live around here?

543
00:27:21,098 --> 00:27:23,134
I don't want to tell you where I live.
I don't trust you.

544
00:27:23,225 --> 00:27:25,762
Oh, okay. You don't have to.
I can look it up.

545
00:27:25,853 --> 00:27:27,593
Look it up?
Is it on the internet?

546
00:27:27,688 --> 00:27:29,224
I can ask someone.

547
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:31,726
- You would do that?
- Probably.

548
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:37,360
How did you know my name
when I met you?

549
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:39,608
I had seen your show.

550
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:44,114
And then when I saw you at Evan's
I knew your name.

551
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:46,240
Yeah, I was really scared.
I thought maybe...

552
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:48,913
I was like, "Do I know this guy?"
I'm, like, the worst at names.

553
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:51,333
You were like, "Hey, Charlyne,
come here."

554
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,752
- I normally wouldn't...
- I'm like, "I don't know you.

555
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:56,956
- Okay, I must know you maybe.
- Normally I wouldn't have even said hello.

556
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,756
Why?

557
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:01,677
'Cause, you know,
it's difficult to.

558
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:05,222
Yeah, but anyway,
that's how I knew your name

559
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:07,550
and I was excited to see you.

560
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:25,279
So you're leaving in a few days?

561
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:28,203
In two days.
I'll be gone for, like, four and a half.

562
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:30,246
- I'll call you tomorrow.
- Okay.

563
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:32,541
Talk on the phone,
have a phone chat.

564
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:34,584
- Okay.
- Okay.

565
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:36,662
Are you okay to drive?

566
00:28:36,757 --> 00:28:38,713
- Do I...?
- You're not high?

567
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,586
- Do I look high?
- No.

568
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:42,884
Do you need to take
my microphone?

569
00:28:44,348 --> 00:28:46,885
Yeah, thanks, Mike.

570
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:52,135
- You want me to turn around?
- All right, this is kind of awkward.

571
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:54,847
- Is it in your shirt?
- Just slip it off.

572
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:59,476
Okay.

573
00:29:01,949 --> 00:29:03,234
It's caught.

574
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,149
It's caught. It's caught.

575
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:08,611
I'll call you. I'll call you.

576
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:10,787
Okay. Bye.

577
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:20,087
Do you remember
your first date?

578
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:22,917
Yes. I invited him

579
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:25,753
to my birthday party at 14.

580
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:28,133
What began as an infatuation

581
00:29:28,225 --> 00:29:30,216
bloomed into full love.

582
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:33,473
And he proposed our junior year
in high school.

583
00:29:33,564 --> 00:29:35,520
Do you remember
how you proposed to her?

584
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,268
- No, do you?
- No.

585
00:29:39,236 --> 00:29:41,352
I'm sure I wasn't on my knees.

586
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:43,437
No.

587
00:29:43,532 --> 00:29:46,990
My mom and dad were not
for me marrying that early,

588
00:29:47,077 --> 00:29:49,739
but they knew that I loved him

589
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,991
and that we wanted to be together.

590
00:29:52,082 --> 00:29:55,165
And they had to sign for me
to be married

591
00:29:55,252 --> 00:29:57,208
because I was only 17.

592
00:29:57,296 --> 00:29:58,786
- Oh, yeah?
- So they did.

593
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,462
I think the young love

594
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:04,632
can sometimes be
the most important.

595
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,679
I know that many...
people now are waiting

596
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:10,847
until later to get married,

597
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:12,845
but I think you lose something.

598
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:16,849
We could have chosen
not to marry before he went to college,

599
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,851
but waiting five years
would have lost

600
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:22,434
much of the magnetism
that we had for each other.

601
00:30:22,528 --> 00:30:26,066
I'm not advising everyone
to get married at 17,

602
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:28,444
but it can work.

603
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:30,776
It sure is not for everybody.
We had a lot of friends

604
00:30:30,871 --> 00:30:33,112
who got married young,
and it didn't work out for them.

605
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:34,537
But it did for us.

606
00:30:34,623 --> 00:30:36,864
How did you guys know
that you were in love

607
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,916
if you've never been
in love before?

608
00:30:39,004 --> 00:30:40,960
Wait for the lightning bolt.

609
00:30:41,048 --> 00:30:43,505
I've been saying that
all of our lives.

610
00:30:43,593 --> 00:30:45,754
Sometimes it's slow
and it grows

611
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:48,210
and all of a sudden
you realize it's there.

612
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:51,547
Many times it happens
in the beginning

613
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:53,552
like it did with us.

614
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:54,883
Yeah.

615
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:57,640
We'd like to share one thing

616
00:30:57,731 --> 00:31:00,063
in asking what events

617
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:02,892
might have stuck out
in our mind through the years.

618
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:06,274
I was ready to deliver

619
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:08,321
our second son

620
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:11,571
when he had to go
to the reserve camp.

621
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,491
I was in the reserves

622
00:31:18,584 --> 00:31:20,791
and I'd spent two weeks
at Fort Polk.

623
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:23,416
And even though we knew
our son was coming,

624
00:31:23,507 --> 00:31:25,418
I still had to go to camp.

625
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:28,501
But they did send me back
when our child was born.

626
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:34,013
We had
a pretty dramatic birth

627
00:31:34,101 --> 00:31:36,683
with several dangers involved

628
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:39,432
with myself and my son,

629
00:31:39,523 --> 00:31:42,014
so I was especially excited

630
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:45,522
to hear the clomp
of his army boots

631
00:31:45,613 --> 00:31:48,070
running down the hall.

632
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:51,114
I knew he was there.
We were all okay.

633
00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:53,658
He runs into the room,

634
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:55,701
saw that we were okay,

635
00:31:55,789 --> 00:31:58,781
and immediately passed out
on the floor.

636
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:03,039
And we will always remember
that birth.

637
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:08,757
We got laundry on the third floor.

638
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:11,005
That doesn't interest me.

639
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:14,422
You all ready
for the interviews today?

640
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:16,677
Uh, yeah.

641
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:19,100
You have a few basic
kind of questions?

642
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:21,644
Yeah, I have some
really good questions.

643
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:24,393
I was thinking about asking...

644
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:25,940
- I can't hear you, Chuck.
- What?

645
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:27,312
I couldn't hear you.

646
00:32:27,404 --> 00:32:30,271
Oh, I just said...

647
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:33,448
Charlyne, Chuck,
you gotta turn it off.

648
00:32:33,535 --> 00:32:35,947
What are you thinking?
I just want to know what you're asking.

649
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:40,325
I'm sorry. What?

650
00:32:40,417 --> 00:32:42,578
You have a few basic...?

651
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:45,828
Do you have a few...?

652
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:47,378
Okay.

653
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:49,627
So are you all set
for the interviews?

654
00:32:49,718 --> 00:32:52,084
Yeah, I have everything set, boss.

655
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:53,715
- Great.
- Thanks.

656
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:56,217
Good.
What are you gonna ask?

657
00:33:01,188 --> 00:33:03,679
Romance is written for women,
mostly by women,

658
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:05,729
although we have male readers

659
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:08,024
and I have fan mail from guys.

660
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:11,194
But romance is really targeted
for women.

661
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:15,365
And it's the emotional bonding
that goes on

662
00:33:15,452 --> 00:33:17,864
that women tend to enjoy
discussing

663
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:20,491
and hearing about and reading
and watching on TV

664
00:33:20,582 --> 00:33:22,823
and in the movies.
And that's what romance is.

665
00:33:22,918 --> 00:33:25,955
People think there's a formula
to romance novels and there's not.

666
00:33:26,046 --> 00:33:28,002
The only thing
that romance has to have is,

667
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:30,546
they have to have a relationship
between two people

668
00:33:30,634 --> 00:33:33,216
and they have to have
some kind of conflict or struggle

669
00:33:33,303 --> 00:33:36,386
that they overcome and then they live
happily ever after, we call it.

670
00:33:36,473 --> 00:33:38,885
It's an "HEA ending"...
happily ever after.

671
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:43,059
There's always something where
the characters are sacrificing...

672
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:45,478
one is sacrificing for the other

673
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:48,352
and that's their sign that they're
really in love with that person.

674
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:51,810
So at some point the character
has to make

675
00:33:51,905 --> 00:33:54,738
some kind of a personal sacrifice
for the other character.

676
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:57,566
And that's the sign.
That's the sign that they're in love.

677
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:04,827
Hey, Charlyne,
will you tell the camera

678
00:34:04,918 --> 00:34:06,704
what you told me
last night on the phone?

679
00:34:06,795 --> 00:34:08,751
What did I tell you last night?

680
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:11,170
When we were on the phone,
talking about the shoot,

681
00:34:11,258 --> 00:34:12,748
and then you said...

682
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:14,048
I don't know.
Remind me.

683
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:16,171
You don't remember what we were
talking about last night?

684
00:34:16,263 --> 00:34:18,254
- No, remind me.
- We were talking about the shoot.

685
00:34:18,348 --> 00:34:20,930
And we were both getting excited
and then Charlyne says,

686
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:23,759
"You know, Nick,
I'm starting to really like Michael."

687
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:26,094
- Did I say that?
- You did.

688
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:29,101
I did say it.

689
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:30,773
And I said, "Really?"
And she goes, "Yeah."

690
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:33,272
And I was like, "Like a boyfriend?"
And she goes, "Yeah."

691
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:35,695
And so we've made an agreement
that we're gonna have to start

692
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:37,272
filming everything
so we don't miss that,

693
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:41,030
because their relationship is definitely
part of the movie now.

694
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:44,825
Greetings, ladies.

695
00:34:49,713 --> 00:34:51,920
What are you gonna get?

696
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:56,125
I think I'm gonna get the BLT,
minus the B, plus the PC.

697
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:57,959
Plus the PC?

698
00:34:58,054 --> 00:35:00,636
Pickles and cheese.

699
00:35:00,724 --> 00:35:03,136
- What?
- That's not a BLT.

700
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:06,138
It's BLT, minus the bacon,
plus pickles and cheese.

701
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:08,390
I think the whole fun
of ordering the BLT

702
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:11,518
is saying, "I'll have a BLT,"
and the simplicity of it,

703
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:14,067
- and they know what you want.
- Well, mine is pretty simple.

704
00:35:14,154 --> 00:35:16,816
It just doesn't have the bacon.
It has cheese and pickles.

705
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:19,818
The sandwich is simple,
but ordering it isn't simple, I mean.

706
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:22,446
So just order your weird
pickle cheese sandwich...

707
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:23,617
Whatever.

708
00:35:23,705 --> 00:35:25,912
...and say, "Can you bring me
all the fixings?"

709
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:29,324
What are you gonna get?

710
00:35:29,419 --> 00:35:31,159
I think I'm gonna get
the Mexican beach salad.

711
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:33,415
I want to say that to the waiter.

712
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:35,713
Yeah, sounds very exotic.

713
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,210
A Mexican beach salad, yeah.

714
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:40,339
He'll look at me and think,
"Oh, this guy gets around."

715
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:43,046
Pretend I'm the waiter.
Hi, can I take your order, please?

716
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,302
- A Mexican beach salad.
- You got it.

717
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:48,351
Now.

718
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:53,014
I really didn't like you
when I first met you.

719
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:55,065
Yeah, I know.

720
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:57,109
How could you tell?

721
00:35:57,197 --> 00:35:59,939
Well, it was pretty obvious.

722
00:36:00,033 --> 00:36:01,864
Yeah?

723
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:03,862
You were pretty hasty
with your judgment.

724
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:05,363
- Was I?
- Little did you know

725
00:36:05,455 --> 00:36:07,912
that I would be someone
that would be taking you out to lunch.

726
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:12,621
And you kept avoiding me.

727
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:17,039
And you kept
walking away from me.

728
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:19,124
You really didn't like me.

729
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:20,709
Yes.

730
00:36:20,804 --> 00:36:23,295
Okay, I won't waste your time.

731
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,760
Hey.

732
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:08,590
Sorry that took so long.
That didn't go as I planned.

733
00:37:08,685 --> 00:37:11,677
- You're a jerk. You're awful.
- I didn't think it would take that long.

734
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:13,932
I had to walk
all the way around.

735
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:17,811
I just thought
it would be a quick thing.

736
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:19,893
Sorry. Did you think
I really left?

737
00:37:19,988 --> 00:37:22,775
Yeah.

738
00:37:22,866 --> 00:37:24,652
Funny, though, right?

739
00:37:26,662 --> 00:37:28,618
I'll pay for your lunch.

740
00:37:28,705 --> 00:37:29,911
You're bribing me?

741
00:37:29,998 --> 00:37:31,454
You're bribing my heart?

742
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:33,452
Yeah.

743
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:35,203
That's right.

744
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:12,449
Oh.

745
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,451
- Turn turn turn!
- Wow.

746
00:38:14,541 --> 00:38:15,997
Argh!

747
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:18,576
Whoa.

748
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:28,253
Give it a throw.
There it is.

749
00:38:28,348 --> 00:38:29,679
Oh.

750
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:42,649
Hey, guys,

751
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:45,524
you guys want to do
anything like...

752
00:38:45,614 --> 00:38:48,356
anything like an arm around each other
or a kiss or anything?

753
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:50,362
This is fine.

754
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:52,409
- Forget it then.
- Thanks for the tip.

755
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:54,533
Keep going, whatever you guys
wanna do.

756
00:38:56,793 --> 00:38:59,159
They weren't into it.

757
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:08,425
How did you guys meet?

758
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:11,342
First time we didn't meet, actually.

759
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:13,138
- First time we didn't meet.
- He stood me up.

760
00:39:13,226 --> 00:39:15,182
- Really? Why?
- I didn't.

761
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:17,226
I was supposed to meet him
at a restaurant.

762
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:19,269
Go ahead and tell the story,
or the lie.

763
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:21,473
- You tell the lie.
- Yeah, go for it.

764
00:39:21,568 --> 00:39:23,775
He never lets me forget this.

765
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:26,649
We set out to meet.
I had just moved to town.

766
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:28,855
He said, "Do you know this place?"
I said, "Yeah."

767
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:32,442
I didn't know the place.
I went to the wrong restaurant

768
00:39:32,538 --> 00:39:35,405
and I'm like, "That's not the restaurant
I thought it was."

769
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:37,739
And so I had to think
quick on my feet.

770
00:39:37,834 --> 00:39:41,543
I just like called, "Uh, I had to take
my nephew to the hospital.

771
00:39:41,628 --> 00:39:43,994
Sorry." So I lied.

772
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:46,752
So I meet him a week later and I was like,
"Oh, so how is your nephew doing?"

773
00:39:46,843 --> 00:39:48,549
He's like, "What do you mean?"

774
00:39:48,637 --> 00:39:50,593
- Busted.
- I'm a really bad liar.

775
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:54,343
Your second date, when you actually met,
what happened there?

776
00:39:54,434 --> 00:39:56,049
I think we had sex.

777
00:39:57,729 --> 00:40:00,266
- Second date... yeah, I think, yeah.
- Oh.

778
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:01,766
- We're gay. That's what you do.
- Yeah, no.

779
00:40:01,858 --> 00:40:03,598
- Really?
- Not really. I don't know, maybe.

780
00:40:03,693 --> 00:40:05,649
Not all gay guys, but we do.

781
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:07,523
I think it was something
really charming

782
00:40:07,615 --> 00:40:09,446
- like a parking lot.
- No, it wasn't.

783
00:40:09,533 --> 00:40:11,023
- Yeah, it was.
- Not me.

784
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:13,358
You guys met at a parking lot
and you guys did it?

785
00:40:13,453 --> 00:40:15,114
No, not in the parking lot, no.

786
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:17,286
We went back to his house
and watched a movie, I think.

787
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:19,364
Check this out...
when I'm in his house...

788
00:40:19,459 --> 00:40:22,326
- I forgot how much dirt he has on me.
...you're looking at the shit

789
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,160
people have on their
mantel and stuff,

790
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:26,291
and like, "Oh, books books,
tchotchke,

791
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:29,795
dead boyfriend,
books, books, tchotchke."

792
00:40:29,886 --> 00:40:32,502
- He had his dead boyfriend cremated...
- His ashes.

793
00:40:32,598 --> 00:40:34,714
- Oh, man.
- So I almost flipped out.

794
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:37,924
I was like, "That's a little creepy."
It was really creepy.

795
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:39,759
Do you guys want
to get married?

796
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,970
He proposed.
I said no.

797
00:40:42,065 --> 00:40:44,351
People that I know are married
aren't happy,

798
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,353
most of them,
the straight ones.

799
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,275
And the gay ones
aren't really happy either.

800
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:50,399
It's like, what's the point?

801
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:52,151
And for us it's not real.

802
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:54,448
And you believe in marriage?

803
00:40:54,536 --> 00:40:57,323
Basically if a piece of paper says

804
00:40:57,413 --> 00:40:59,620
that he can be covered
by my insurance...

805
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:01,663
- that's a good thing.
- Yeah.

806
00:41:01,751 --> 00:41:04,163
And we've been together 10 years.
He doesn't have insurance.

807
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:06,335
Have you guys ever had
your heart broken?

808
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:09,164
Um, a lot, actually.

809
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:11,169
When you're gay and, like, you...

810
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:14,923
I'm not really attracted
to effeminate dudes,

811
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:18,381
so when you're in high school,
you're growing up,

812
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:21,388
you're in college or whatever,
you tend to fall for the straight guy.

813
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:23,811
And that doesn't tend
to work out.

814
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:25,354
What about you?

815
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:27,853
I didn't have my heart broken

816
00:41:27,944 --> 00:41:30,310
so much.

817
00:41:30,405 --> 00:41:33,863
You know, I had an ex in a box.

818
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:36,987
It wasn't like he broke my heart...

819
00:41:37,078 --> 00:41:39,364
- Yeah.
...did anything to me,

820
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:43,073
but, you know, he died on me,
the bastard.

821
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:46,204
It's like, you could have just said,
"I don't like you anymore," and left.

822
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:48,331
But no, he had to die.

823
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,711
I can't with my left hand.

824
00:41:52,802 --> 00:41:54,087
Jab jab, boom!

825
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:55,588
Good, come at me now.

826
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,921
One, two, strike!

827
00:41:58,016 --> 00:42:00,382
The other night I had this dream.

828
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:02,808
And I was onstage
and a spotlight hit me,

829
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:05,978
and when I looked down
I was wearing this beautiful pink dress

830
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:08,056
and my hair was
all blonde and curly.

831
00:42:08,151 --> 00:42:10,563
I tried to do magic
before my song,

832
00:42:10,652 --> 00:42:12,483
but it didn't work.

833
00:42:12,573 --> 00:42:14,905
It was like...
it was like I'd lost my zing.

834
00:42:14,991 --> 00:42:17,152
Do you think it's 'cause
you're with Mike

835
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:19,734
and you're afraid you're becoming,
like, all girlie and stuff?

836
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:22,411
I don't know.
I've never been one of the girls, you know?

837
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:24,363
- Yeah.
- I want to be his girlfriend,

838
00:42:24,459 --> 00:42:26,245
but I don't want to be
"the girlfriend."

839
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:28,826
I mean, no one ever
remembers "the girlfriend."

840
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:30,877
Sure. You want to be
one of the dudes.

841
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:32,921
I am one of the dudes.

842
00:42:33,009 --> 00:42:34,499
Well...

843
00:42:34,594 --> 00:42:37,256
How would you define
a divorce?

844
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:39,632
I think probably the best

845
00:42:39,724 --> 00:42:42,010
definition of divorce

846
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:44,763
is the taking of two people

847
00:42:44,854 --> 00:42:47,596
who once proclaimed
their love for each other

848
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:52,525
and separating them
as far as you can apart.

849
00:42:52,613 --> 00:42:54,569
Why is there so many divorces?

850
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:58,694
Well, one thing is they're not
getting to know each other enough

851
00:42:58,785 --> 00:43:00,741
before they decide to get married,

852
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:03,035
and they get married too quick.

853
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:05,078
That could be one thing.

854
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:08,784
And another thing is, you know,
we're not a very patient society.

855
00:43:08,878 --> 00:43:12,086
And so I think that maybe people
get into relationships,

856
00:43:12,173 --> 00:43:15,040
and if they're not exactly
the way they want them

857
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:17,796
and there's no quick fix,
they just give up.

858
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:21,755
Do you think that this job
has given you perspective on love

859
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:23,305
or changed it at all?

860
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:26,475
Oh, absolutely.
I mean, the people I see in here...

861
00:43:26,563 --> 00:43:28,804
makes me realize

862
00:43:28,898 --> 00:43:33,483
that there are many many people
more dysfunctional than I.

863
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:36,060
That's nice.
That's reassuring.

864
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:39,397
When we go home at night,
we've spent all day

865
00:43:39,492 --> 00:43:42,325
hearing clients,
or people in his court,

866
00:43:42,411 --> 00:43:44,527
you know, say terrible things
about each other

867
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:47,785
and talk about the terrible ways
they're treated each other.

868
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:49,831
We both go home at night and think,

869
00:43:49,919 --> 00:43:53,332
"Whew, aren't we lucky?
We don't have all those problems."

870
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:56,084
And it really gives you
a different perspective, I think.

871
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:58,666
If you can hang in there
and you really love 'em,

872
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:00,626
it gets better all the time.

873
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:04,589
Well, that, and the learning to overlook
other people's shortcomings.

874
00:44:04,684 --> 00:44:07,596
We all have bad breath
when we wake up in the morning.

875
00:44:07,687 --> 00:44:09,097
That's true.

876
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:12,180
Accepting the fact
that just because he says,

877
00:44:12,275 --> 00:44:14,857
"Pull this finger," and giggles...

878
00:44:14,944 --> 00:44:18,903
you can get along with that.

879
00:44:19,949 --> 00:44:25,535
Sally and I met in Houston in,
oh, I guess, 1980.

880
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:30,035
I was working as an associate judge
down there

881
00:44:30,126 --> 00:44:32,617
in one of the family law courts

882
00:44:32,712 --> 00:44:34,873
in Houston, in Harris County,

883
00:44:34,964 --> 00:44:37,922
and she was practicing law

884
00:44:38,009 --> 00:44:39,965
in that court.

885
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:43,169
And I thought that I would
really like to go out with her,

886
00:44:43,264 --> 00:44:46,347
not to mess up
our professional relationship.

887
00:44:46,434 --> 00:44:49,221
And I hinted to her boss

888
00:44:49,312 --> 00:44:51,268
that I would like to do so,

889
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:54,062
and I think she put pressure on Sally
to do that,

890
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:56,562
to go out with me.

891
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:58,358
- True?
- Yes, she did.

892
00:44:58,446 --> 00:45:01,062
She threatened to fire me
if I didn't go out with him.

893
00:45:01,157 --> 00:45:03,614
And I did not want
to go out with him at all.

894
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:06,238
I had another boyfriend at the time.

895
00:45:06,329 --> 00:45:08,320
I was not interested
in dating, but...

896
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:11,406
The other boyfriend
never talked, though.

897
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,456
Well, that is true.

898
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:16,502
But in order to keep my job,
yes, I did go out with him.

899
00:45:16,589 --> 00:45:18,705
And I had a fairly decent time.

900
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:22,883
But what really convinced me
that I wanted to go out with him again

901
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:25,302
was a little later.

902
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:27,971
Maybe a week or two later
after our date

903
00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:30,015
it was a downpour in Houston.

904
00:45:30,102 --> 00:45:32,559
And I was at the courthouse.

905
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:35,764
I was wearing
a pair of Gucci loafers

906
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:38,520
that I had just purchased
the weekend before.

907
00:45:38,612 --> 00:45:41,319
And I spent more money
on those Gucci loafers

908
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:44,317
than I had ever spent
in my life on a pair of shoes.

909
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:46,615
I think they might have been $154.

910
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:48,658
I was just devastated

911
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:51,909
because I had parked
several blocks away from the courthouse

912
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:54,365
and I had to leave
and it was pouring down rain.

913
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:57,202
And as I left his court,

914
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:59,287
I think I probably said
something like,

915
00:45:59,382 --> 00:46:01,464
"Well, I sure don't want to ruin
my new shoes,

916
00:46:01,549 --> 00:46:03,414
but I guess
it's pouring down rain."

917
00:46:03,511 --> 00:46:05,467
And it was just a gullywasher.

918
00:46:05,553 --> 00:46:07,885
And I remember Don saying,

919
00:46:07,974 --> 00:46:09,839
"Don't worry about it.
I'll take care of it."

920
00:46:09,934 --> 00:46:11,925
He goes,
"You just wait right here."

921
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:13,975
And he said, "I'll be right back."

922
00:46:14,063 --> 00:46:16,395
He went and got in his car,
which was a Jeep,

923
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:19,315
and he drove it up
onto the plaza

924
00:46:19,402 --> 00:46:22,109
in front of the family law courts
building in Houston

925
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:24,403
and drove up under the porch.

926
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:26,651
And so he opened the door
and said, "Hop in."

927
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:29,529
And I just walked dry,
under the porch,

928
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:33,238
got in his Jeep and we drove off.
And he took me to my car.

929
00:46:35,126 --> 00:46:37,082
And I thought, "Now that's cool.

930
00:46:37,169 --> 00:46:39,205
Who would drive up
on downtown Houston

931
00:46:39,297 --> 00:46:42,505
up onto the plaza
of the family law courts building?"

932
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:45,458
And I thought, "You know what?
I think I'd better stick with him."

933
00:46:45,553 --> 00:46:49,922
Then I had to move to Amarillo
because I lost my job over that.

934
00:46:50,016 --> 00:46:53,349
No, he did not.
That is not true.

935
00:46:53,436 --> 00:46:55,552
We moved to Amarillo
because we wanted to.

936
00:46:55,647 --> 00:46:57,603
True enough.

937
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:02,689
You want me to make you dinner,
Charlyne?

938
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:04,689
Really?

939
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:05,895
Yeah.

940
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:07,776
Do you have any food?

941
00:47:07,867 --> 00:47:10,028
I know how to make a few things.
What do you feel like?

942
00:47:10,119 --> 00:47:12,326
Um, I don't know.

943
00:47:12,413 --> 00:47:13,778
That's enough. Thank you.

944
00:47:13,873 --> 00:47:15,613
- We can go grocery shopping together.
- Okay.

945
00:47:15,708 --> 00:47:17,619
- Want to go right now?
- Okay.

946
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:20,201
- Let's not make any plans.
- Be spontaneous.

947
00:47:20,296 --> 00:47:21,752
- Yeah.
- Real wild.

948
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,704
Let's finish this real quick.

949
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:29,050
I feel awful now.

950
00:47:29,138 --> 00:47:30,844
You didn't have to do that.

951
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:32,671
- Do you want to go right now?
- Yeah.

952
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:34,723
- Are they gonna come?
- Um...

953
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:37,426
- It might be a little embarrassing.
- We'll catch up.

954
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:39,728
- You want to come?
- Yeah.

955
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:42,056
Sorry.

956
00:47:42,151 --> 00:47:44,267
It's okay.
We'll be quick.

957
00:47:44,362 --> 00:47:46,148
- You guys want to catch up?
- Just go.

958
00:47:46,238 --> 00:47:48,069
Okay.

959
00:47:50,368 --> 00:47:52,575
- What do you want to get?
- I don't know.

960
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:55,528
Maybe when we look around
it will give us some ideas.

961
00:47:55,622 --> 00:47:56,611
Yeah.

962
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:59,244
I don't know what to make you
since you don't eat meat.

963
00:47:59,335 --> 00:48:01,872
We can make grilled cheese,

964
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:03,418
quesadillas.

965
00:48:03,506 --> 00:48:05,462
This is all dog food.

966
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:07,130
Not true... puppy.

967
00:48:07,218 --> 00:48:10,585
Puppy food, dog food
and nylon stockings.

968
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:13,591
Yeah, we're not gonna find
our dinner in this aisle.

969
00:48:14,683 --> 00:48:17,049
I think I'm so hungry
that I don't know what I feel like.

970
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:18,850
- Same here.
- Nothing sounds good enough.

971
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:26,400
We've been here
a half-hour now

972
00:48:26,487 --> 00:48:28,273
I'm not even
hungry anymore.

973
00:48:28,364 --> 00:48:29,524
We should be
eating by now.

974
00:48:29,615 --> 00:48:32,698
Let's look in the frozen food section.
That might be our best bet.

975
00:48:32,785 --> 00:48:37,199
There... cheese.
"Crisp Crust."

976
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:40,201
Party pizza?

977
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:46,871
1/2 hour in the oven.

978
00:48:46,966 --> 00:48:48,922
We can order a pizza
faster than that.

979
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:51,125
I think we should order one.

980
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:53,586
Hey, Charlyne.

981
00:48:53,681 --> 00:48:55,967
How's it going?

982
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:58,674
How are you doing?

983
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:02,387
Did you enjoy

984
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:05,644
the pizza

985
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:08,476
that we got?

986
00:49:10,698 --> 00:49:12,734
Should we kiss?

987
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:15,407
Okay.

988
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:17,530
Seems appropriate.

989
00:49:23,127 --> 00:49:25,493
- What are you laughing at?
- Nothing.

990
00:49:25,588 --> 00:49:27,704
- Why are you laughing?
- I'm just laughing.

991
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:34,092
It's out of the way now.

992
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:43,260
Now what should we do?

993
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:59,030
Ooh, this is pretty fun, man.

994
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:01,407
Yeah.

995
00:50:04,585 --> 00:50:08,373
Uh, I was wondering...

996
00:50:10,341 --> 00:50:14,129
if we always have to shoot
me and Michael.

997
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:18,421
We haven't had any privacy,
you know, since the moment we've met.

998
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:21,006
Everything's under
a magnifying glass...

999
00:50:21,101 --> 00:50:24,639
me, you and all of them.

1000
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:26,971
Charlyne, I mean, we did
agree to do this.

1001
00:50:27,066 --> 00:50:29,227
We said we were gonna make
a documentary

1002
00:50:29,318 --> 00:50:32,776
and we were gonna film everything,
and that's where the story's going now.

1003
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:34,899
Yeah.

1004
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:37,697
Let's say you and Mike went on a date
and we decided not to film you

1005
00:50:37,785 --> 00:50:39,400
and you guys had an amazing night

1006
00:50:39,495 --> 00:50:41,907
and it was the first time you ever
told each other you loved each other

1007
00:50:41,997 --> 00:50:44,909
- and we didn't get it.
- Don't worry, that's not gonna happen.

1008
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,412
Okay, but just like the principle of it...
we need to.

1009
00:50:47,503 --> 00:50:49,539
I feel awkward about it.
I know Mike does.

1010
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:51,916
But I honestly don't know
what else to do.

1011
00:50:52,007 --> 00:50:54,623
We're making a movie.

1012
00:50:54,717 --> 00:50:56,753
Yeah.

1013
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:00,592
If we're shooting everything,
how come we're not shooting

1014
00:51:00,683 --> 00:51:03,925
me, you know, sleeping?

1015
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:06,305
We'll shoot you sleeping.
We'll do a night of it. Could be fun.

1016
00:51:06,397 --> 00:51:08,353
- Serious?
- Seriously.

1017
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:09,930
Awesome.

1018
00:51:10,025 --> 00:51:13,108
- We got a deal, Chuck Yi.
- My life just got a lot more interesting.

1019
00:51:16,781 --> 00:51:19,272
I do two general readings

1020
00:51:19,368 --> 00:51:21,609
and I'll tell you what's going on with you

1021
00:51:21,703 --> 00:51:23,068
and kind of where you're headed.

1022
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:24,619
Okay.

1023
00:51:24,707 --> 00:51:26,914
Okay, here we go.

1024
00:51:30,212 --> 00:51:34,205
Okay, emotion, breakup...

1025
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:37,212
love, difficulty.

1026
00:51:37,303 --> 00:51:39,259
Separation from someone you love.

1027
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:41,712
And to me this is romantic.

1028
00:51:43,225 --> 00:51:46,638
Highs and lows, so good and bad.

1029
00:51:46,729 --> 00:51:49,471
So it's almost like your life
is a roller coaster.

1030
00:51:49,565 --> 00:51:51,476
Okay, are you seeing
somebody right now?

1031
00:51:51,567 --> 00:51:52,602
Yeah.

1032
00:51:52,693 --> 00:51:54,479
Okay, all I need is just
his first name.

1033
00:51:54,569 --> 00:51:56,810
- Michael.
- Michael, okay.

1034
00:51:56,905 --> 00:51:58,691
Okay, Mike.

1035
00:52:01,076 --> 00:52:05,319
Romantic... definitely romantic,
absolutely.

1036
00:52:05,414 --> 00:52:08,497
He's got a big heart.
He's very sensitive.

1037
00:52:08,584 --> 00:52:11,166
A nice guy.
I get a really good energy for him.

1038
00:52:12,171 --> 00:52:16,005
Well, he does love you,
that's for sure, so I do get that.

1039
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:20,334
But he's kind of interested in you
for money reasons, okay?

1040
00:52:20,429 --> 00:52:22,636
'Cause of all the money
that comes up here.

1041
00:52:22,723 --> 00:52:25,806
But I have no money.

1042
00:52:25,893 --> 00:52:28,805
I keep getting financial,
so business,

1043
00:52:28,896 --> 00:52:30,636
financial, career.

1044
00:52:30,731 --> 00:52:34,599
you have a key to him
building his career, okay?

1045
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:36,604
But he is more successful than me.

1046
00:52:36,694 --> 00:52:39,527
That's what I'm telling you.
I'm saying, what does he think of you?

1047
00:52:39,615 --> 00:52:41,321
He does love you,
he does care for you,

1048
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:44,992
but there's still some
business connection,

1049
00:52:45,079 --> 00:52:47,866
or that he can succeed
or you can succeed

1050
00:52:47,956 --> 00:52:49,492
or he can help you.

1051
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:53,041
That's fine.
I'm gonna just leave that out there.

1052
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:55,289
You think about it, okay?

1053
00:52:56,924 --> 00:52:59,290
You know what?
It's a good chemistry,

1054
00:52:59,385 --> 00:53:01,376
it really is, between you and him,

1055
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:04,462
but it's not gonna work.
I have to tell you that.

1056
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:05,921
Do you know why?

1057
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:07,972
Oh, that's a good question.
Let me see why.

1058
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:10,392
It will end, but, okay,
let me see.

1059
00:53:10,479 --> 00:53:12,515
Okay.

1060
00:53:15,109 --> 00:53:17,771
It's just you're each gonna
go down your own roads.

1061
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:21,900
You will outgrow each other
and have different philosophies

1062
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:24,606
and go down different roads
eventually.

1063
00:53:24,702 --> 00:53:27,318
You're meant to be together now

1064
00:53:27,413 --> 00:53:29,369
and it's great.

1065
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:31,993
It works now, so good.

1066
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:36,827
Okay? Anything else?

1067
00:53:41,552 --> 00:53:43,508
Do you think it was real?

1068
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:46,837
No. And I apologize for saying

1069
00:53:46,932 --> 00:53:48,888
I wanted you to go
to a con artist.

1070
00:53:50,227 --> 00:53:52,718
I thought it was going to be
a lot more fun and funny

1071
00:53:52,813 --> 00:53:56,055
and I think seeing
what a clear scam it was,

1072
00:53:56,150 --> 00:53:57,765
it was just kind of dirty.

1073
00:53:57,860 --> 00:53:59,771
It kind of made me
really upset.

1074
00:53:59,862 --> 00:54:01,193
It made me upset too...

1075
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,396
not about you and Mike,
but just about humanity.

1076
00:54:03,491 --> 00:54:04,606
Yeah.

1077
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:07,282
It's like you're sitting
in this dump on the side of a highway

1078
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:09,155
lying to people.

1079
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:12,409
It's a load of crap.
That's all it was.

1080
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:14,956
Ugh, man.

1081
00:54:15,043 --> 00:54:18,410
I'm sorry, Chuck. Tomorrow's all yours.
We can do whatever you want.

1082
00:54:22,009 --> 00:54:23,715
Fireworks, Chuck!

1083
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:25,292
Fireworks!

1084
00:54:25,387 --> 00:54:27,218
- Fireworks!
- Fireworks!

1085
00:54:27,306 --> 00:54:29,718
Fireworks!

1086
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:31,924
Get ready to run, Chuck.

1087
00:54:32,019 --> 00:54:33,555
Okay.

1088
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:34,760
Go!

1089
00:54:34,855 --> 00:54:36,561
Go, Chuck, go!

1090
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:52,361
Love in some cases
is almost overrated.

1091
00:54:52,456 --> 00:54:53,662
Totally.

1092
00:54:53,749 --> 00:54:55,831
I think it gets too hung up

1093
00:54:55,918 --> 00:54:57,374
on heat and passion

1094
00:54:57,461 --> 00:54:59,417
and I think that "like"
is really

1095
00:54:59,505 --> 00:55:02,042
the most important thing
for the longevity of a relationship.

1096
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:03,713
It's all about the "like."

1097
00:55:03,801 --> 00:55:05,917
You have to really enjoy
being around somebody.

1098
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:08,343
'Cause there's people
that can't stand each other

1099
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:10,512
that love each other
on certain levels.

1100
00:55:10,599 --> 00:55:13,136
How did you guys know
that you loved each other?

1101
00:55:13,227 --> 00:55:15,183
I just felt like I...

1102
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:18,353
I don't know if I can see myself
in my life without Bill.

1103
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:22,353
I think that a relationship
just has to evolve naturally too.

1104
00:55:22,444 --> 00:55:24,480
- I don't think anything can be forced.
- No.

1105
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:26,232
It just has to unfold.

1106
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:28,279
And I think too,
like with your boyfriend,

1107
00:55:28,367 --> 00:55:30,528
you know, there's things
about him you really like,

1108
00:55:30,619 --> 00:55:33,031
and probably if you didn't see him
for a long time

1109
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:35,828
you would really miss it. And if you
thought you were gonna lose him

1110
00:55:35,916 --> 00:55:37,872
you might go, "Wait a minute,

1111
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:39,871
I don't think I want to live
without this person."

1112
00:55:39,962 --> 00:55:42,578
It's weird 'cause I think
everyone's definition of love

1113
00:55:42,673 --> 00:55:44,959
is so different.
And, like, what you're saying...

1114
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:47,132
I'm like, "I don't think I'm in love,"

1115
00:55:47,219 --> 00:55:49,756
'cause I do miss him
and I miss certain things.

1116
00:55:49,847 --> 00:55:53,305
Yeah, you know, you might be.
It might just hit you one day.

1117
00:55:53,392 --> 00:55:55,348
You might just wake up one day
and go,

1118
00:55:55,435 --> 00:55:58,017
"I don't know, I think
I really love this guy."

1119
00:55:58,105 --> 00:56:00,471
When you meet somebody

1120
00:56:00,566 --> 00:56:04,229
and you just get that feeling
like you'd known them forever

1121
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:06,401
and they're definitely
a part of your life

1122
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:09,070
and you can't imagine life
without them

1123
00:56:09,157 --> 00:56:11,773
and you want to be with them
every minute of every day

1124
00:56:11,869 --> 00:56:14,736
and share everything with them,
that's love.

1125
00:56:14,830 --> 00:56:17,412
I remember asking my mom,
"When do you know you're in love?"

1126
00:56:17,499 --> 00:56:21,788
And she said, "It's when you can't stand
to not be with that person."

1127
00:56:21,879 --> 00:56:23,494
We just got engaged
a few months ago.

1128
00:56:23,589 --> 00:56:25,705
I mean, I've never felt this way
about anybody

1129
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:27,755
and it's just like... it felt right

1130
00:56:27,843 --> 00:56:29,458
and I think we're happy with it.

1131
00:56:29,554 --> 00:56:32,466
Yeah, I really think it will work out,
even though we're young.

1132
00:56:32,556 --> 00:56:34,888
- I think we'll be good together.
- We will.

1133
00:56:34,975 --> 00:56:37,967
The world just looked better.
I remember leaves looked brighter.

1134
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:40,017
I was driving back to college
and I thought,

1135
00:56:40,105 --> 00:56:41,766
"Oh my God, the world
just looks wonderful."

1136
00:56:41,857 --> 00:56:44,098
It just hit me when I talked to him.

1137
00:56:44,192 --> 00:56:46,148
When I first saw him even,

1138
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:47,817
you know, I thought, "Wow."

1139
00:56:47,905 --> 00:56:50,863
And then when I talked to him,
I knew right away

1140
00:56:50,949 --> 00:56:52,940
that that was the one.

1141
00:56:53,035 --> 00:56:55,777
As far as, like, knowing it for sure,
no one ever really knows

1142
00:56:55,871 --> 00:56:57,782
anything about love,

1143
00:56:57,873 --> 00:57:00,080
but you just gotta go
with what feels right.

1144
00:57:00,167 --> 00:57:02,032
When you've been married
for a long time

1145
00:57:02,127 --> 00:57:04,618
you have this history.
Nobody can replace that.

1146
00:57:04,713 --> 00:57:07,204
You know, you've got all these
memories that you share together.

1147
00:57:07,299 --> 00:57:10,917
It's worth really fighting for
and working for.

1148
00:57:11,011 --> 00:57:13,844
You can't replace that person.
You can't.

1149
00:57:13,931 --> 00:57:16,968
Well, it was 50 years ago,
a little more than-

1150
00:57:17,059 --> 00:57:19,425
50 years and nine months ago

1151
00:57:19,518 --> 00:57:23,727
when I first saw Bob
at the airport.

1152
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:28,851
He parked his motorcycle
right outside of my office window.

1153
00:57:28,946 --> 00:57:30,902
He had these tight Levi's on.

1154
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:34,447
And I said, "Oh my God,
I gotta meet this guy,"

1155
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:36,991
because I was the only young,
single female

1156
00:57:37,079 --> 00:57:39,035
in this whole cargo area.

1157
00:57:40,791 --> 00:57:42,497
I thought I was the star
of the whole area.

1158
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:45,667
I'd take a cigarette out
and 15 guys would run over to light it.

1159
00:57:45,754 --> 00:57:47,870
I didn't know that he was there

1160
00:57:47,965 --> 00:57:50,047
until he bought that Harley.

1161
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:52,465
And it was the purr of the Harley
that got me.

1162
00:57:52,552 --> 00:57:54,588
Yeah, I was there for six months
before that

1163
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:56,170
with an old English bike...

1164
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:58,630
never saw her,
never heard anything.

1165
00:57:58,726 --> 00:58:02,139
So you guys out there, get a Harley.

1166
00:58:02,229 --> 00:58:04,185
It's got a special sound to it

1167
00:58:04,272 --> 00:58:07,184
that gets right
to the heart of the matter.

1168
00:58:09,236 --> 00:58:13,070
And then we courted
on the motorcycle.

1169
00:58:25,127 --> 00:58:27,869
And I lured him
to a deserted beach

1170
00:58:27,963 --> 00:58:29,874
on our first date.

1171
00:58:29,965 --> 00:58:32,172
It was dark. It was quiet.
The moon was out.

1172
00:58:32,259 --> 00:58:33,965
The tide was coming in.

1173
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:36,043
You could hear the water
lapping against the shore.

1174
00:58:36,138 --> 00:58:38,174
It was really nice.

1175
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:41,757
And we sat on the beach

1176
00:58:41,852 --> 00:58:44,264
and kissed for the first time.

1177
00:58:46,815 --> 00:58:49,557
And it worked out
to be a nice, happy ending.

1178
00:58:49,651 --> 00:58:52,518
50 years together,
and it seems

1179
00:58:52,612 --> 00:58:55,445
like it's only been
a couple of years.

1180
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:57,693
It just goes by so fast.

1181
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:01,193
What do you got to say
about that?

1182
00:59:01,288 --> 00:59:03,279
You've covered everything.

1183
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:11,745
I wrote a song for Michael.

1184
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:13,751
One day I was hanging out
with him

1185
00:59:13,842 --> 00:59:16,754
and it wasn't even close
to Christmas,

1186
00:59:16,845 --> 00:59:20,178
but I was like, "Wow, I'm really happy
hanging out with him.

1187
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:22,221
It's kind of like Christmas."

1188
00:59:22,309 --> 00:59:24,595
And so I said
he smells like Christmas in this song.

1189
00:59:24,686 --> 00:59:28,019
But I don't really think
he smells like Christmas.

1190
00:59:28,106 --> 00:59:30,062
He just makes me happy.

1191
00:59:32,194 --> 00:59:33,684
That's it.

1192
00:59:33,779 --> 00:59:36,145
I'm so embarrassed right now.

1193
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:37,900
You guys are filming.

1194
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:41,028
I'm gonna record it
and give it to him one day.

1195
01:00:01,681 --> 01:00:05,048
# What's that smell
I smell on you? #

1196
01:00:05,143 --> 01:00:08,135
# Is it magic perfume? #

1197
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:11,222
# 'Cause I swear to God #

1198
01:00:11,316 --> 01:00:14,433
# You smell just like Christmas #

1199
01:00:14,527 --> 01:00:18,395
# To me #

1200
01:00:20,117 --> 01:00:22,824
# Yeah, well, you #

1201
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:25,994
# Are my Christmas tree #

1202
01:00:26,081 --> 01:00:28,823
# You mean everything to me #

1203
01:00:28,917 --> 01:00:32,000
# You mean everything
to me #

1204
01:00:32,087 --> 01:00:34,169
# And you #

1205
01:00:34,256 --> 01:00:36,838
# Are my shooting star #

1206
01:00:36,925 --> 01:00:39,883
# If you shoot me
in my heart #

1207
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:45,340
# Then I'll fall apart #

1208
01:00:45,433 --> 01:00:48,925
# You lift me up
when I'm down #

1209
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:50,931
# Ooh ooh ooh #

1210
01:00:51,022 --> 01:00:53,729
# You pick me up
off the ground #

1211
01:00:53,817 --> 01:00:55,933
# Ahh ahh ahh #

1212
01:00:56,027 --> 01:00:59,110
# And I don't know
if it's such a good idea #

1213
01:00:59,197 --> 01:01:02,234
# 'Cause you're way down now #

1214
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:05,533
# And I'm way up here #

1215
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:08,987
# Yeah, you have
really long arms #

1216
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:13,075
# So why don't you use them
to hold me tight? #

1217
01:01:33,023 --> 01:01:35,685
This is great, Charlyne.

1218
01:01:35,775 --> 01:01:38,482
I can show my family now
what you look like.

1219
01:01:38,570 --> 01:01:41,061
Or you can just come over
and they can see your face.

1220
01:01:41,156 --> 01:01:42,566
You should come to Toronto.

1221
01:01:42,657 --> 01:01:45,399
I don't know if I can.
I have to ask Nick.

1222
01:01:45,493 --> 01:01:48,735
Don't look at me. We gotta finish
shooting this movie, Chuck.

1223
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:51,071
- Michael: 
- Yeah, when we're done.

1224
01:01:51,166 --> 01:01:53,327
Yeah, that'd be cool.

1225
01:01:53,418 --> 01:01:54,828
Yeah.

1226
01:01:58,006 --> 01:02:00,122
You want to do that thing?

1227
01:02:00,217 --> 01:02:02,583
Oh, you mean the thing.

1228
01:02:02,677 --> 01:02:04,463
Mm-hmm.

1229
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:06,465
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1230
01:02:06,556 --> 01:02:07,762
Ready?

1231
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:09,510
Go! Go get 'em!

1232
01:02:09,601 --> 01:02:10,932
- Guys!
- Too fast.

1233
01:02:11,019 --> 01:02:12,304
- Don't fall.
- Okay.

1234
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:15,933
Go as fast as you can, Jay.
I'm gonna get them when they stop.

1235
01:02:16,024 --> 01:02:17,935
Guys, guys, guys!

1236
01:02:18,026 --> 01:02:19,516
Don't look back.

1237
01:02:19,611 --> 01:02:21,351
- Guys!
- Don't stop.

1238
01:02:21,446 --> 01:02:23,402
Guys, guys.

1239
01:02:23,490 --> 01:02:25,651
- Are they following?
- Come on.

1240
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:29,200
- Are they following?
- I don't know.

1241
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:34,371
So we're here with...

1242
01:02:34,459 --> 01:02:36,415
Caitlyn Felder.

1243
01:02:36,502 --> 01:02:38,458
...and we're talking
about love.

1244
01:02:38,546 --> 01:02:40,457
Do you believe
in true love, Caitlyn?

1245
01:02:40,548 --> 01:02:41,708
Yes.

1246
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:43,381
And what do you think
true love is?

1247
01:02:43,468 --> 01:02:45,424
When they hug and kiss

1248
01:02:45,513 --> 01:02:47,378
and be happy together.

1249
01:02:47,472 --> 01:02:49,508
What's love?
How do you spell it?

1250
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:52,136
L-O-V-E!

1251
01:02:52,227 --> 01:02:53,717
Do you guys believe in true love?

1252
01:02:53,812 --> 01:02:56,474
Yes!

1253
01:02:56,564 --> 01:02:58,646
- Do you guys believe in true love?
- Yes.

1254
01:02:58,733 --> 01:03:00,143
Why?

1255
01:03:00,235 --> 01:03:02,567
- Because I have a boyfriend.
- No, you don't.

1256
01:03:02,654 --> 01:03:05,145
- Do you guys say, "I love you"?
- Yeah.

1257
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:06,480
What is true love?

1258
01:03:06,574 --> 01:03:09,782
True love is when you love
somebody so-o-o much,

1259
01:03:09,869 --> 01:03:13,987
like us girls love Chris Brown.
You don't know him.

1260
01:03:14,082 --> 01:03:15,367
What's a perfect date?

1261
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:18,791
You need to take somebody to Applebee's
and get them hot wings.

1262
01:03:18,878 --> 01:03:20,834
- Are you picking your nose?
- Eww!

1263
01:03:20,922 --> 01:03:23,334
Give me that. Give me that.
That's gross. Give me that.

1264
01:03:23,425 --> 01:03:25,461
A dinner and a movie.
But before that

1265
01:03:25,552 --> 01:03:27,759
you'll watch the sunset
on the beach.

1266
01:03:27,846 --> 01:03:30,007
And the restaurant
that you will go to

1267
01:03:30,098 --> 01:03:32,054
is a French Riviera restaurant

1268
01:03:32,142 --> 01:03:34,098
that only sells seafood.

1269
01:03:34,185 --> 01:03:36,176
That's a good date.

1270
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:39,763
On the count of three
you gotta act like a chicken.

1271
01:03:39,858 --> 01:03:41,849
One, two, three!

1272
01:03:46,197 --> 01:03:48,028
- Do you have a boyfriend?
- No, ma'am.

1273
01:03:48,116 --> 01:03:50,482
- Have you had a boyfriend?
- No, ma'am.

1274
01:03:50,577 --> 01:03:53,694
You like Tory?
Yow!

1275
01:03:53,788 --> 01:03:55,494
What's your ideal husband?

1276
01:03:55,583 --> 01:03:57,949
Masculine and cute.

1277
01:03:58,043 --> 01:03:59,624
- Do you want to get married?
- No.

1278
01:03:59,711 --> 01:04:01,542
- Why not?
- Because.

1279
01:04:01,629 --> 01:04:03,961
- It's gross?
- Yes.

1280
01:04:04,049 --> 01:04:06,005
Do you want to get married?

1281
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:09,334
- Say yes.
- Say no.

1282
01:04:09,429 --> 01:04:12,045
- To me?
- No.

1283
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:14,552
Why don't you guys ask her
about her boyfriend Mike?

1284
01:04:18,063 --> 01:04:19,553
What?

1285
01:04:19,647 --> 01:04:24,357
You had a boyfriend all this time
and you didn't tell us?

1286
01:04:24,444 --> 01:04:25,604
How cruel.

1287
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:28,653
Have you ever smooched
at the movies?

1288
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:31,197
Not at the movies
'cause it's gross.

1289
01:04:31,284 --> 01:04:33,070
Okay, where have you?

1290
01:04:33,161 --> 01:04:34,241
Argh!

1291
01:04:34,329 --> 01:04:36,695
Sit in the tickle chair,
young lady.

1292
01:04:36,790 --> 01:04:38,246
All right, so you're in love.

1293
01:04:38,333 --> 01:04:40,540
I'm not in love.
You're in love

1294
01:04:40,627 --> 01:04:42,083
with Chris Brown.

1295
01:04:42,170 --> 01:04:44,832
At least I admitted it.

1296
01:04:44,923 --> 01:04:47,005
She got you on that one, Chuck.

1297
01:04:47,092 --> 01:04:49,048
What would your advice be

1298
01:04:49,135 --> 01:04:52,423
for someone who isn't sure
if they're in love

1299
01:04:52,514 --> 01:04:54,926
and will find love?

1300
01:04:57,018 --> 01:04:59,259
Well, I would say

1301
01:04:59,354 --> 01:05:01,595
take a minute
and look at your life.

1302
01:05:01,689 --> 01:05:06,479
Look at the person
that you think likes you.

1303
01:05:08,154 --> 01:05:10,190
Find out for yourself.

1304
01:05:11,533 --> 01:05:13,364
All right.

1305
01:05:17,789 --> 01:05:20,371
I think we're like
an hour away now.

1306
01:05:20,458 --> 01:05:22,119
Do you want me to drive
the rest of the way?

1307
01:05:22,210 --> 01:05:23,575
No, it's okay.
I can drive.

1308
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:24,750
- Are you sure?
- Mm-hmm.

1309
01:05:24,838 --> 01:05:27,750
- You look tired.
- No, I'm not tired.

1310
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:30,415
It's gonna be fun.

1311
01:05:30,509 --> 01:05:33,967
I'm excited.
I've never been to a drive-in before.

1312
01:05:40,812 --> 01:05:42,723
What should we talk about?

1313
01:05:42,814 --> 01:05:44,099
What do you mean?

1314
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:45,646
I never know what to say
when the cameras are here.

1315
01:05:45,733 --> 01:05:47,064
You don't have to say anything.

1316
01:05:47,152 --> 01:05:49,643
I just feel more comfortable
when they're not around.

1317
01:05:49,736 --> 01:05:53,479
It's a given.
I think everyone feels that way.

1318
01:05:53,575 --> 01:05:55,611
Well, I mean, why are we
being taped then?

1319
01:05:55,702 --> 01:05:59,286
You knew from the beginning, like,
everywhere I go the cameras go too.

1320
01:05:59,372 --> 01:06:02,614
That's the way it's been
since we met.

1321
01:06:02,709 --> 01:06:05,576
I mean, I don't mean
to make you uncomfortable,

1322
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:07,706
but that's just
the situation right now.

1323
01:06:07,797 --> 01:06:10,254
I know.
I just, you know...

1324
01:06:10,341 --> 01:06:13,504
it might have been more fun
if we could just go together.

1325
01:06:13,595 --> 01:06:15,506
Yeah, it would have been,

1326
01:06:15,596 --> 01:06:18,383
but I don't really have a choice,

1327
01:06:18,475 --> 01:06:22,013
at least right now.

1328
01:06:23,062 --> 01:06:25,144
Mm-hmm.

1329
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:30,938
Try to have fun?

1330
01:06:32,489 --> 01:06:34,696
Yeah.

1331
01:06:41,206 --> 01:06:44,073
- What's with the globe?
- Well, it's for my announcement.

1332
01:06:44,167 --> 01:06:46,829
First of all, thank you guys
for coming over.

1333
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:49,536
And the production has decided

1334
01:06:49,631 --> 01:06:51,462
to pay for a trip to...

1335
01:06:54,302 --> 01:06:55,883
France.

1336
01:06:55,970 --> 01:06:57,881
Paris.

1337
01:06:57,972 --> 01:07:00,429
We're going to Paris
in four and a half weeks.

1338
01:07:00,517 --> 01:07:03,384
We leave on a Thursday night.
We come back on a Sunday night.

1339
01:07:05,522 --> 01:07:08,480
So we have a whole weekend in Paris
to do whatever we want.

1340
01:07:08,566 --> 01:07:11,273
- So it's gonna be filmed?
- Yeah, well, the whole crew's coming.

1341
01:07:11,361 --> 01:07:13,352
- What are we doing?
- Whatever you guys want.

1342
01:07:13,446 --> 01:07:15,687
I think we could get, like,
for the end of the documentary...

1343
01:07:15,782 --> 01:07:18,398
that we can get a nice shot
of you two guys in Paris

1344
01:07:18,493 --> 01:07:20,449
just doing whatever
you guys are gonna do.

1345
01:07:20,537 --> 01:07:22,744
It's like you guys
in this magical city of love.

1346
01:07:22,830 --> 01:07:25,572
So why am I going?

1347
01:07:25,666 --> 01:07:27,452
It's kind of just...

1348
01:07:27,544 --> 01:07:29,034
Well, 'cause you guys
are dating.

1349
01:07:29,128 --> 01:07:31,244
So it's kind of me and Charlyne
hanging out in Paris?

1350
01:07:31,339 --> 01:07:33,079
- That's exactly what it is.
- That's all-

1351
01:07:33,174 --> 01:07:35,210
That's all it is.
That's the only plan.

1352
01:07:35,301 --> 01:07:37,667
I think it's a real great,
natural end

1353
01:07:37,762 --> 01:07:40,128
of, like, you guys
just exactly where you guys are at

1354
01:07:40,223 --> 01:07:42,259
in your relationship...
nothing's forced...

1355
01:07:42,350 --> 01:07:44,261
but just in Paris.

1356
01:07:44,352 --> 01:07:46,092
- And that's the ending?
- Yeah.

1357
01:07:46,187 --> 01:07:49,224
I mean, what do you think
people will get from that?

1358
01:07:49,315 --> 01:07:51,351
What are you trying to show?

1359
01:07:53,194 --> 01:07:54,684
I...

1360
01:07:54,779 --> 01:07:57,737
If we're being sent there,
it's different than if just the two of us went

1361
01:07:57,824 --> 01:07:59,780
and you guys filmed it.
You know, it seems like

1362
01:07:59,867 --> 01:08:02,279
we're being sent there
so that you can get some kind of footage.

1363
01:08:02,370 --> 01:08:05,658
I don't think I thought
about it that much.

1364
01:08:05,748 --> 01:08:08,239
I just kind of thought it would be
a nice location to end it...

1365
01:08:08,334 --> 01:08:10,290
you guys kind of walking around

1366
01:08:10,378 --> 01:08:13,745
in what I consider
the most beautiful city in the world.

1367
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:16,331
I just... I don't understand

1368
01:08:16,426 --> 01:08:19,793
what the point of us
going there is.

1369
01:08:19,887 --> 01:08:23,129
It's just kind of like a sweet,
hopeful ending to the movie.

1370
01:08:23,224 --> 01:08:25,966
Hoping that...

1371
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:28,676
Just that you have
what you have in real life,

1372
01:08:28,771 --> 01:08:31,433
that you're happy...

1373
01:08:32,984 --> 01:08:34,975
that, like, you found love.

1374
01:08:37,238 --> 01:08:39,229
But I didn't.

1375
01:08:47,582 --> 01:08:50,198
A free trip?

1376
01:08:50,293 --> 01:08:52,875
- I've never been to Paris.
- Yeah, me neither.

1377
01:08:52,962 --> 01:08:55,078
Me either.

1378
01:08:56,424 --> 01:08:58,585
So let's go to Paris.

1379
01:09:10,229 --> 01:09:14,063
Charlyne called saying to come by,

1380
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:16,516
so we'll see what it is.

1381
01:09:23,242 --> 01:09:25,198
Well, we're here.

1382
01:09:25,286 --> 01:09:27,618
I brought the crew.

1383
01:09:35,672 --> 01:09:38,709
All right.

1384
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:41,132
Well, you got us out here, Chuck.

1385
01:09:47,225 --> 01:09:49,261
What's up?

1386
01:09:50,978 --> 01:09:54,186
Uh, so...

1387
01:09:54,273 --> 01:09:56,685
Michael called me afterwards

1388
01:09:56,775 --> 01:10:00,438
and we talked for a long time

1389
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:03,613
and he basically said

1390
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:06,863
that he didn't want
to do this anymore.

1391
01:10:08,413 --> 01:10:11,120
He didn't want to do what anymore?
This?

1392
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:14,540
We already kind of shot so much.

1393
01:10:14,627 --> 01:10:16,834
He didn't want to be with me anymore.

1394
01:10:18,923 --> 01:10:21,255
What did he say?

1395
01:10:21,342 --> 01:10:23,253
I don't know.

1396
01:10:23,344 --> 01:10:25,084
He didn't give a reason?

1397
01:10:25,179 --> 01:10:28,171
No, he gave reasons,
but I just don't understand.

1398
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:31,636
I'm sorry to hear that, Charlyne.

1399
01:10:31,728 --> 01:10:34,435
I mean it.

1400
01:10:34,522 --> 01:10:37,434
Yeah, me too.

1401
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:41,567
You know, let's have fun.

1402
01:10:41,654 --> 01:10:44,191
You want to order a pizza
and hang out, make a night of it?

1403
01:10:44,282 --> 01:10:46,614
Okay. Play video games?

1404
01:10:46,701 --> 01:10:49,818
Let's play every video game
and every instrument you have.

1405
01:10:49,912 --> 01:10:52,244
You don't know
how to play anything.

1406
01:10:52,331 --> 01:10:55,915
I will just strum on anything
and make an ass of myself.

1407
01:10:56,002 --> 01:10:57,867
Okay.

1408
01:11:08,639 --> 01:11:11,472
# See, it's real love #

1409
01:11:11,559 --> 01:11:13,800
# Real love #

1410
01:11:13,895 --> 01:11:17,479
# If I knew what I know now #

1411
01:11:17,565 --> 01:11:19,521
# Back then. #

1412
01:11:19,609 --> 01:11:22,476
I mainly write about love

1413
01:11:22,570 --> 01:11:24,731
and I've been in a long-distance
relationship

1414
01:11:24,821 --> 01:11:28,564
for the last two years.
My girlfriend lives in Taiwan, in Taipei.

1415
01:11:28,659 --> 01:11:31,822
And she came here
for three weeks

1416
01:11:31,913 --> 01:11:34,370
and, I don't know,
I guess I thought

1417
01:11:34,457 --> 01:11:36,573
that she was gonna come here
and stay here.

1418
01:11:36,667 --> 01:11:39,784
I thought that
up until she was gone.

1419
01:11:39,879 --> 01:11:41,961
And I don't think
I'm ever gonna see her again.

1420
01:11:42,048 --> 01:11:44,460
If you knew that by her leaving...

1421
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:47,166
you loved her.
If you knew it before she left,

1422
01:11:47,261 --> 01:11:49,172
what would you have done
differently?

1423
01:11:49,263 --> 01:11:53,006
I would have asked her to stay.
I would have, you know.

1424
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:56,843
I would have, you know,
stopped thinking

1425
01:11:56,938 --> 01:11:59,896
about all the details of it,
you know.

1426
01:11:59,982 --> 01:12:02,189
Why can't you just go after her

1427
01:12:02,276 --> 01:12:05,439
if you still feel as passionate
as you did then?

1428
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:08,525
I don't know, you know.

1429
01:12:08,616 --> 01:12:11,153
Maybe because I'm still
the same person that let her go then.

1430
01:12:11,244 --> 01:12:14,031
And that song is about

1431
01:12:14,121 --> 01:12:16,908
how I totally blew it, you know.

1432
01:12:31,430 --> 01:12:34,388
Chuck. Hey, Chuck.

1433
01:12:34,475 --> 01:12:37,091
Hey, Charlyne
we've got work to do.

1434
01:12:37,186 --> 01:12:39,518
We got hot chocolate for you.

1435
01:12:39,605 --> 01:12:41,812
It's a nice enough room.

1436
01:12:41,899 --> 01:12:44,231
All right, Chuck,

1437
01:12:44,318 --> 01:12:46,730
check this out.

1438
01:12:48,656 --> 01:12:50,647
Wow.

1439
01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:53,399
It's gorgeous.

1440
01:12:55,621 --> 01:12:57,907
Wow.

1441
01:12:57,999 --> 01:13:00,661
Man, that is incredible.

1442
01:13:04,881 --> 01:13:07,247
Unbelievable.

1443
01:13:09,051 --> 01:13:11,007
Dude, I could live here.

1444
01:13:11,095 --> 01:13:12,881
This is amazing.

1445
01:13:18,477 --> 01:13:20,433
You should.

1446
01:13:20,521 --> 01:13:23,103
I'd consider it...

1447
01:13:23,190 --> 01:13:27,274
hang out in cafés all the time,

1448
01:13:27,361 --> 01:13:29,443
drink cappuccinos, work on my novel.

1449
01:13:29,529 --> 01:13:31,360
You're stupid.

1450
01:13:35,077 --> 01:13:37,113
Are you feeling okay, Chuck?

1451
01:13:38,372 --> 01:13:40,328
Eh...

1452
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:42,907
I mean, it's not ideal, but I figure

1453
01:13:43,002 --> 01:13:45,493
we'll just go around,
shoot some footage.

1454
01:13:45,588 --> 01:13:48,375
We're in Paris.

1455
01:13:48,466 --> 01:13:50,798
You know, it is gorgeous.

1456
01:13:54,055 --> 01:13:56,091
Let's get to it, Chuck.
What do you say?

1457
01:13:57,558 --> 01:13:59,514
I would say "Shower up" and stuff,

1458
01:13:59,601 --> 01:14:01,717
but I know you.

1459
01:14:01,812 --> 01:14:04,224
Maybe throw some pants on.

1460
01:14:24,543 --> 01:14:25,828
Trois.

1461
01:14:29,340 --> 01:14:31,331
Interview that guy.

1462
01:14:32,343 --> 01:14:34,334
Merci.

1463
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:17,172
Nick, can we just go to the hotel?

1464
01:15:17,263 --> 01:15:19,504
Please just keep walking, Chuck,
and we can cut this together.

1465
01:15:19,598 --> 01:15:21,463
I don't feel good.
I feel sick.

1466
01:15:21,559 --> 01:15:24,426
Okay, I'm actually begging you
just to keep going.

1467
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:27,387
No no, we have to go now.

1468
01:15:27,481 --> 01:15:29,722
I'm cold. I'm tired.

1469
01:15:29,817 --> 01:15:31,728
We've been doing this
for 12 hours.

1470
01:15:31,819 --> 01:15:35,311
It's not about cold and tired. I understand...
I know what's kind of happening here.

1471
01:15:35,406 --> 01:15:37,567
This is about your breakup.
And you're freaking out.

1472
01:15:37,658 --> 01:15:40,365
- You're stressed out.
- No, this has nothing to do with Mike.

1473
01:15:40,453 --> 01:15:42,409
- I'm not sad about Mike.
- Okay, I know that you're sad

1474
01:15:42,496 --> 01:15:44,782
about Mike, Charlyne.
And I just need you to do this once

1475
01:15:44,874 --> 01:15:46,785
and just really help me
finish this.

1476
01:15:46,876 --> 01:15:48,707
And we're both gonna be so happy.

1477
01:15:48,794 --> 01:15:50,409
I promise you.

1478
01:15:50,504 --> 01:15:53,086
I'm not sad about Mike.
I'm not sad about anything.

1479
01:15:53,174 --> 01:15:55,085
I'm just sad

1480
01:15:55,176 --> 01:15:57,963
that he wants me to love him
and I can't.

1481
01:16:01,724 --> 01:16:04,966
I can't.
I can't just lie and pretend I love him.

1482
01:16:07,188 --> 01:16:09,429
All right.

1483
01:16:09,523 --> 01:16:11,639
You want to go back to the hotel?

1484
01:16:11,734 --> 01:16:13,975
Let's go back to the hotel.

1485
01:16:14,070 --> 01:16:16,106
I think we're good.

1486
01:16:27,374 --> 01:16:28,955
Hey, Chuck.
What's going on?

1487
01:16:29,043 --> 01:16:30,283
I just woke up.

1488
01:16:30,377 --> 01:16:32,368
How did you sleep?
Are you okay?

1489
01:16:32,463 --> 01:16:34,169
Eh, so-so.

1490
01:16:34,256 --> 01:16:36,668
So-so? Yeah, me too.

1491
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:39,796
Sorry if I was mean
to you yesterday.

1492
01:16:39,887 --> 01:16:41,502
I apologize.

1493
01:16:41,597 --> 01:16:44,134
It's okay.
It's not your fault.

1494
01:16:44,225 --> 01:16:46,591
I'm just really overwhelmed
right now.

1495
01:16:46,685 --> 01:16:48,971
Yeah, I hear you.

1496
01:16:49,063 --> 01:16:50,394
Everything okay?

1497
01:16:50,481 --> 01:16:54,224
I don't know.
I mean, I know I'm not in love right now,

1498
01:16:54,318 --> 01:16:57,355
but that doesn't mean
I'll never fall in love.

1499
01:16:57,446 --> 01:17:00,483
I just know that I don't want
to lose Michael.

1500
01:17:50,750 --> 01:17:52,957
We should probably get going.

1501
01:17:59,592 --> 01:18:01,958
All right, it's coming up.

1502
01:18:08,392 --> 01:18:10,974
Yeah, this is it.

1503
01:18:23,324 --> 01:18:25,315
Okay, are you ready?

1504
01:18:34,877 --> 01:18:37,459
Watch out. It's slippery.

1505
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:43,586
Well, we're here.

1506
01:18:43,677 --> 01:18:44,917
This is it.

1507
01:18:45,012 --> 01:18:47,003
Okay.

1508
01:18:48,682 --> 01:18:50,718
Good luck, amiga.

1509
01:18:57,358 --> 01:18:58,939
Don't slip.

1510
01:19:16,377 --> 01:19:19,335
Hey. Hey.

1511
01:19:19,421 --> 01:19:20,877
Hi, Mike.

1512
01:19:20,965 --> 01:19:22,421
- Hey. How is it going?
- Hey.

1513
01:19:22,508 --> 01:19:24,419
It's going okay.

1514
01:19:24,510 --> 01:19:26,171
How are you doing?

1515
01:19:26,262 --> 01:19:27,468
I'm pretty good.

1516
01:19:27,554 --> 01:19:29,419
Are you busy?

1517
01:19:29,515 --> 01:19:31,881
No, just hanging out.

1518
01:19:31,976 --> 01:19:33,967
What are you doing?

1519
01:19:34,061 --> 01:19:35,722
Just hanging out.

1520
01:19:35,812 --> 01:19:38,645
Yeah.

1521
01:19:38,732 --> 01:19:41,565
So you guys are in Brampton?

1522
01:19:41,652 --> 01:19:43,643
Yeah. It's kind of cold.

1523
01:19:43,737 --> 01:19:45,147
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1524
01:19:47,074 --> 01:19:48,939
You want to come inside?
It's warmer.

1525
01:19:49,034 --> 01:19:51,025
Okay.

1526
01:19:58,669 --> 01:20:01,911
Um, you guys should probably
stay out here.

1527
01:20:03,048 --> 01:20:05,960
You want us to stay out here?

1528
01:20:09,054 --> 01:20:11,670
Okay. Cool.

1529
01:20:17,354 --> 01:20:19,345
Okay.

1530
01:20:25,738 --> 01:20:28,696
- You want to take off your shoes?
- Yeah.

1531
01:20:28,782 --> 01:20:31,023
How long are you
gonna be in Brampton?

1532
01:20:31,118 --> 01:20:32,574
Just today.

1533
01:20:32,661 --> 01:20:35,698
Charlyne's mike's still on, Nick,
if you want me to keep rolling.

1534
01:20:35,789 --> 01:20:38,872
- I can hear both of them.
- You want a warm drink?

1535
01:20:38,959 --> 01:20:42,497
Um, I really missed you.

1536
01:20:42,588 --> 01:20:45,125
Yeah. Me too.

1537
01:20:45,215 --> 01:20:47,046
She just told Mike
she missed him.

1538
01:20:50,929 --> 01:20:52,920
Cut the tape, Jay.

1539
01:21:21,543 --> 01:21:24,205
There I was,
on the road again.

1540
01:21:24,296 --> 01:21:26,582
I was holding tight
to my motorcycle

1541
01:21:26,673 --> 01:21:31,007
and Michael was holding tight
to my muscles.

1542
01:21:31,095 --> 01:21:32,756
This wasn't the end
of our journey.

1543
01:21:32,846 --> 01:21:37,431
We still had a long long way
back to sunny California,

1544
01:21:37,518 --> 01:21:41,978
just me and my man.

1545
01:21:42,064 --> 01:21:44,271
And being the wild horse
that I was,

1546
01:21:44,358 --> 01:21:46,349
I couldn't help but drive
really fast...

1547
01:21:48,529 --> 01:21:50,440
so fast, in fact...

1548
01:21:50,531 --> 01:21:53,364
that the cops began to chase us.

1549
01:21:53,450 --> 01:21:56,112
I didn't know what to do,

1550
01:21:56,203 --> 01:21:58,410
but I knew I couldn't have
let them stop me.

1551
01:21:58,497 --> 01:22:00,863
I'd come too far.

1552
01:22:00,958 --> 01:22:03,870
I zigzagged,
spelled my name in cursive,

1553
01:22:03,961 --> 01:22:06,327
I went up on one wheel,

1554
01:22:06,422 --> 01:22:09,038
then I went up on no wheels...

1555
01:22:09,133 --> 01:22:11,545
nothing.

1556
01:22:12,845 --> 01:22:14,961
Bullets whizzed by
on both sides.

1557
01:22:15,055 --> 01:22:17,717
I turned to Michael and said,

1558
01:22:17,808 --> 01:22:20,299
"If you want to turn back now, baby,
I'll understand.

1559
01:22:20,394 --> 01:22:23,932
You've gotten yourself involved
with a very dangerous broad."

1560
01:22:24,022 --> 01:22:27,435
"No, I don't want to turn back now.
I kind of like danger."

1561
01:22:27,526 --> 01:22:28,641
Perfect.

1562
01:22:32,281 --> 01:22:34,693
They fired off one last shot

1563
01:22:34,783 --> 01:22:36,739
and this time

1564
01:22:36,826 --> 01:22:39,033
it didn't miss.

1565
01:23:03,812 --> 01:23:06,519
With fire behind me,
I got up,

1566
01:23:06,606 --> 01:23:09,188
bruised and battered
from the horrible crash.

1567
01:23:09,276 --> 01:23:12,018
The cops pointed their guns at me.

1568
01:23:12,112 --> 01:23:15,525
I looked at Michael.
He was hurt. He was hurt bad.

1569
01:23:15,616 --> 01:23:18,028
The captain yelled
through his megaphone,

1570
01:23:18,118 --> 01:23:20,450
threatening to shoot,
but I didn't care.

1571
01:23:20,537 --> 01:23:22,323
And I told them that too.
I told them,

1572
01:23:22,414 --> 01:23:26,828
"I don't care!
Life is too short to be wondering what if!

1573
01:23:26,919 --> 01:23:30,161
Sometimes you just gotta live
and see what happens,

1574
01:23:30,255 --> 01:23:32,211
even if you get hurt.

1575
01:23:32,299 --> 01:23:36,633
Sometimes you can only feel something
if you take a risk.

1576
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:40,838
And I, Charlyne Yi,
am taking that risk.

1577
01:23:43,644 --> 01:23:46,056
Arghh-hh-hh!"

1578
01:23:49,565 --> 01:23:52,557
And with that,
the captain took off his sunglasses

1579
01:23:52,653 --> 01:23:55,736
to reveal a single tear.

1580
01:23:55,822 --> 01:23:58,859
I looked around
and all the cops were crying.

1581
01:23:58,951 --> 01:24:00,737
The captain looked at me and said,

1582
01:24:00,827 --> 01:24:04,069
"Go on, get the hell out of here,
you crazy kid."

1583
01:24:04,164 --> 01:24:07,406
And so I threw Michael
over my shoulder

1584
01:24:07,501 --> 01:24:12,370
and walked off into the distance,

1585
01:24:12,464 --> 01:24:15,831
never looking back.

1586
01:24:24,017 --> 01:24:27,555
And, um, that's pretty much
what happened. Right?

1587
01:24:27,647 --> 01:24:29,603
Yeah, that's exactly
what happened.

1588
01:26:03,283 --> 01:26:06,696
# What's that smell
I smell on you? #

1589
01:26:06,786 --> 01:26:09,778
# Is it magic perfume? #

1590
01:26:09,872 --> 01:26:12,864
# 'Cause I swear to God #

1591
01:26:12,959 --> 01:26:16,042
# You smell just like Christmas #

1592
01:26:16,129 --> 01:26:19,997
# To me #

1593
01:26:25,347 --> 01:26:28,054
# Yeah, well, you #

1594
01:26:28,141 --> 01:26:31,224
# Are my Christmas tree #

1595
01:26:31,311 --> 01:26:34,053
# You mean everything to me #

1596
01:26:34,147 --> 01:26:37,230
# You mean everything
to me #

1597
01:26:37,317 --> 01:26:39,399
# And you #

1598
01:26:39,486 --> 01:26:42,068
# Are my shooting star #

1599
01:26:42,155 --> 01:26:45,113
# If you shoot me
in my heart #

1600
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:50,570
# Then I'll fall apart #

1601
01:26:50,664 --> 01:26:53,701
# You lift me up
when I'm down #

1602
01:26:53,792 --> 01:26:55,703
# Ooh ooh ooh #

1603
01:26:55,793 --> 01:26:58,500
# You pick me up
off the ground #

1604
01:26:58,587 --> 01:27:00,703
# Ahh ahh ahh #

1605
01:27:00,799 --> 01:27:03,882
# And I don't know
if it's such a good idea #

1606
01:27:03,969 --> 01:27:07,006
# 'Cause you're way down now #

1607
01:27:07,097 --> 01:27:10,260
# And I'm way up here #

1608
01:27:10,350 --> 01:27:13,763
# Yeah, you have
really long arms #

1609
01:27:13,854 --> 01:27:17,847
# So why don't you use them
to hold me tight? #

1610
01:27:44,926 --> 01:27:47,008
Thank you very much.

1611
01:27:52,009 --> 01:27:53,009
