1
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:26,003
Malone!

2
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:34,138
Williams, what is it?
What did we hit?

3
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:36,815
l don't know.
There's something in the water.

4
00:03:37,283 --> 00:03:39,148
Clear us now, Williams.

5
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:43,478
-Hold steady, Wayne.
-There's something down there.

6
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:46,054
Clear it away.

7
00:03:48,094 --> 00:03:49,356
l can't see anything.

8
00:03:58,271 --> 00:03:59,966
Williams.

9
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,462
Hey, out there.

10
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:31,398
You've got the one and only
Stevie Wayne...

11
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:34,095
...broadcasting from my own
little corner of the world...

12
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:38,107
...high in the KAB lighthouse
on Antonio Island.

13
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:42,008
It is perfect weather for this week's
dedication of the new statue...

14
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:46,144
...honoring the memory
of Antonio Bay's founding fathers.

15
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:49,253
So get on down to the town hall
and check out the monument...

16
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,320
...to those four brave men.

17
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:55,119
One of whom was
my great-great-grandfather...

18
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:56,886
...Richard Wayne.

19
00:04:57,096 --> 00:04:58,688
Did I already mention that?

20
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:01,562
David Williams.

21
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:04,498
Patrick Malone.

22
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:08,766
Norman Castle. Richard Wayne.

23
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,670
-lt's all wrong.
-Oh, come on, Kathy.

24
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:12,572
Who cares which one
holds the telescope.

25
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:13,973
lt's a spyglass, Tom.

26
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:17,149
David Williams is supposed to be
holding it. He was the visionary.

27
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:18,984
We've gotta get this right.

28
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:21,653
The four of them rode out
against impossible odds...

29
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:23,719
...to defend this island
with their lives.

30
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:25,447
l know, l know. Through the fog.

31
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,785
The Malone family name is on
that statue, Tom.

32
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:33,364
-lt has to be accurate.
-We've got tourists arriving on Friday.

33
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:36,057
What do you wanna do,
send it back?

34
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:38,066
Fine. We'll have
the unveiling tomorrow...

35
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:40,569
...and l'll send it back
at the end of the season.

36
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:13,033
Look around you, boys.
This is God's country.

37
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:16,367
Anywhere you go on Earth--
Sea of Cortez, Nantucket Sound...

38
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:20,012
...Gulf of Mexico. --you'll never find
better fishing than what we had here.

39
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:23,547
-Sushi?
-No. l'm good, thanks.

40
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,580
Nice speech.

41
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:29,721
And you've been to how many
of those places?

42
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:31,514
Not a one.

43
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:34,989
My dad used to tell me stories.
He was the traveler.

44
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:37,685
Sure is a long way out
to find the sandbar.

45
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:41,129
Well, this is where
the ocean floor is.

46
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:43,632
Which is where the kelp
and the little fish are...

47
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:45,963
...which is why you got
some big fish here today.

48
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,639
-Mr. Spooner?
-Sir?

49
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:51,002
-Let's weigh the anchor, call it a day.
-Yes, sir.

50
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:11,256
Damn. Hey, yo, Nick.
We're snagged on something.

51
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,837
Spooner? You all right?

52
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:22,030
The winch is jammed.
l can't shut it off.

53
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:24,835
-Shut it down.
-l'm trying to.

54
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:27,005
Spooner. Spooner.

55
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,005
-Nick, get up here.
-Give it some slack.

56
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:32,707
l'm trying to, all right?
The winch is stuck.

57
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:38,117
Hey, l lost all my fish.

58
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:40,524
-We're going down.
-We're not going down.

59
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:43,058
-Spooner.
-Can't get it. lt's not coming loose.

60
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:06,145
You guys okay?

61
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:50,821
Yeah. See?
You got a little something there.

62
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:55,131
Sorry about the mishap.
Come back and see us again.

63
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:57,996
Yeah, we'll be back.

64
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:03,330
What? They said they'd be back.
They-- They-- l believe them.

65
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:05,869
l was convinced, when they said...

66
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:08,774
...''We'll be back,''
they had the ''l'll be back'' face.

67
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:13,111
-Hey, yo, Nick.
-Yeah, in here.

68
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:15,116
l don't suppose they left
a brother a tip.

69
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:16,288
Yeah, right.

70
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:19,185
Hey, you know
that wasn't my fault, right?

71
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,053
Don't-- Do that again.

72
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:25,357
Damn, you sexy as hell
when you're mad. lt's incredible.

73
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:27,592
Where you going?
We got decks to swab.

74
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:30,732
l'm going to Little Ray's to get
a clutch for the one you broke.

75
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:32,495
l broke it?

76
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:35,902
Make sure you end up at Little Ray's.
Don't end up at little Stevie's.

77
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:38,334
-That was a one-time thing.
-All three times?

78
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:41,411
Because l remember the lighthouse,
then the time in the field.

79
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:44,674
Oh, let's not forget about
the little church parking lot, choir boy.

80
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:47,682
-Twice. lt was twice.
-Twice all three times?

81
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:50,185
-Your point is?
-Really don't have one.

82
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:52,687
But she does know Elizabeth.
What if she blabs?

83
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,855
Elizabeth...

84
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:57,825
...is 3000 miles away.
She's been gone for six months.

85
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:02,091
Distance is not a factor.
Women have testicle telepathy, man.

86
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:03,768
Hose down the boat, lock it up...

87
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:06,063
-...so we don't go out of business.
-''We''?

88
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,331
We need to book
another charter to make money.

89
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,634
l got a idea.
Why don't you do some work here...

90
00:10:10,843 --> 00:10:12,071
...and l'll get the clutch.

91
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,836
l'm The Skipper,
and you're Gilligan.

92
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:16,810
Like that? After all that ''we,''
now l'm just Gilligan?

93
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:18,813
And l'm by myself, huh?

94
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:29,855
So that's it, huh?

95
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:32,087
How much that cost?

96
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:35,597
A heartfelt tribute to the founding
fathers of Antonio Bay.

97
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:38,201
Could've used that money
down at the marina.

98
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:40,031
New sea-wall, shore up that pier.

99
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:42,400
These four men built this town
out of nothing.

100
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:45,771
Without their sacrifice,
there wouldn't be a marina or a pier.

101
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:48,242
ln honoring the past,
we celebrate the present.

102
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:50,210
l never understood that line myself.

103
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:53,749
-And l'm sure you never will, Nicholas.
-Mrs. Williams.

104
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:56,922
Gonna come to the unveiling?
Your family's name is on that statue.

105
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:59,216
l can't help that, can l?

106
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:38,781
Oh, no.

107
00:12:50,469 --> 00:12:54,200
--adrift. North-by-northwest swells
past the break.

108
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:58,604
Otherwise, you've got fair winds
and flat waters.

109
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:01,780
Oh, and me, your lighthouse keeper,
Stevie Wayne.

110
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:04,142
Voice that launched
a thousand ships.

111
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:05,715
So if you're not in the mood...

112
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:08,216
...turn it down,
because l'm gonna turn it up...

113
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:11,947
...on 94.5, KAB...

114
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:15,457
...your island alternative to
the modern music establishment.

115
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:18,789
Playing the music l wanna hear.

116
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:46,623
-Want a ride?
-Wrong direction.

117
00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:55,623
Not anymore.

118
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,268
You're not a freak, are you?

119
00:13:57,903 --> 00:13:59,336
Yeah, actually, l am.

120
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:04,402
-Good.
-Shit.

121
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:07,272
l leave town, you start picking up
strange girls on the road.

122
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:11,142
-Elizabeth? No, no. l recognized you.
-l haven't been gone that long, Nick.

123
00:14:11,817 --> 00:14:13,011
l knew it was you.

124
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:25,127
-So you're back.
-No place like home.

125
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:28,366
Only took you six months
to figure that out.

126
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:32,427
l just need to come back for a while.

127
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:37,272
And, Nick...

128
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:41,610
...next time
open the door for a lady.

129
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:52,986
Ahoy, mateys.

130
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:56,161
Another perfect moonlit eve
here on the isle...

131
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:58,455
...and you're listening
to Stevie Wayne...

132
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:01,565
...your very own
beacon in the night.

133
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:03,394
Oh, shit.

134
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:07,169
Can't say that on regular radio
but what the hell.

135
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:09,637
l can say whatever l want.
lt's my very own station.

136
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:14,404
Listen up. Got a low-tide warning
in the a.m. for you.

137
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:17,707
And as l check
my lighthouse gauges...

138
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,647
...looks like the old barometer
is on the rise.

139
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:27,049
So it could be, Dan the Weatherman
might just be right for a change.

140
00:15:38,904 --> 00:15:40,872
Hey, yo, Sean.

141
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:43,098
Get your ass up here
and take the helm.

142
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:45,402
One second, ladies.

143
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:47,743
Yeah. My turn to play.

144
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:52,350
-This is my cousin's boat, man.
-Well, Nick's not here, is he?

145
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:54,018
Huh? You see your cousin?

146
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:55,743
That sucks.
Why do l have to drive?

147
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,923
Because l'm The Skipper,
and you're Gilligan.

148
00:15:58,123 --> 00:15:59,454
Oh, right.

149
00:15:59,658 --> 00:16:02,058
Ladies, the Spooner wait is over.

150
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:06,428
Yeah. Booty on the Boat,
the new reality show.

151
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,795
Ladies and gentlemen, l'd like to
introduce you to our guests of honor:

152
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:13,363
Mandi and Brandi, the twins.

153
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:14,766
We're not twins.

154
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,966
-My name's Jennifer.
-Sean, they're not twins.

155
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:20,873
-Neither are we.
-So we can do this now.

156
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,308
You swear y'all ain't twins?

157
00:16:22,514 --> 00:16:24,880
You know you girls could model?
l could hook you up.

158
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:26,949
Right after this little audition tape.

159
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:31,184
l just gotta pick up
a part for the Seagrass.

160
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,948
lt'll just take a second.

161
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:36,218
And, you, don't go anywhere,
all right?

162
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:58,845
You know the difference
between flotsam and jetsam?

163
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:01,952
-Machen.
-People get washed up on shore.

164
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:05,419
Some bob around at sea forever.

165
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:09,017
You used to be Elizabeth.

166
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:12,861
-l still am.
-l have something to show you.

167
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:18,502
lf you touch it, things will change.

168
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:42,693
lt's still ticking.

169
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:45,420
lt wasn't ticking before.

170
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:47,760
Where'd you get it?

171
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,996
From the sea. Came back.

172
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:54,104
Sooner or later, everything does.
Do you have a lighter?

173
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:56,735
Yeah.

174
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:05,916
lt's a hallmark. Tells where a piece
was made and roughly when.

175
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,555
Looks familiar.

176
00:18:17,362 --> 00:18:18,829
Elizabeth.

177
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,395
Farewell, Elizabeth.

178
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:29,100
What was that about?

179
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:33,169
He found a watch on the beach.

180
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:35,843
That guy gives me the creeps.

181
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:40,284
l know it sounds crazy, but l felt like
l'd seen it somewhere before.

182
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:41,817
Where?

183
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,718
l don't know. Let's go.

184
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:29,724
-Hey, Andy.
-Hey, darling.

185
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:31,197
Hey, Dan.

186
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:33,337
You lonely over there without me?

187
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:35,803
Remind me why l gave you
my cell phone number again?

188
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:38,033
Because l'm 6 feet of burning love.

189
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:40,006
Actually you're 5'9'', Dan.

190
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:43,147
Now tell me why you called,
or l'm gonna hang up.

191
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:46,408
Okay, okay. l just thought you might
like something to talk about.

192
00:19:46,618 --> 00:19:47,812
Okay. I'm listening.

193
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,750
l got something
on my Doppler a minute ago.

194
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:52,150
Sounds kinky.

195
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:55,053
Looks like a fog bank
about 1 0 miles out...

196
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,955
...and it's moving
straight towards us.

197
00:19:57,162 --> 00:20:01,030
Well, my gauges must be wrong then.
l'm showing a wind blowing due west.

198
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:03,793
Now, what kind of fog
moves against the wind?

199
00:20:04,002 --> 00:20:07,233
You got me.
But my radar doesn't lie.

200
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,636
-Gotta go. I'm on.
-Okay.

201
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:15,141
lt is just before 1 0 on Spivey Point.

202
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:19,147
This is Stevie Wayne,
beaming my signal across the sea.

203
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:22,582
Dan the Weatherman says
a fog bank is rolling in offshore.

204
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:25,783
So if l were you,
l would lock the doors...

205
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:29,757
...throw away the keys
and whip up a pitcher of martinis...

206
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:33,659
...while you listen to another hour
of music on KAB.

207
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:37,301
Serving up the platters that matter.

208
00:20:38,637 --> 00:20:41,003
There's no fog out there.

209
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:43,606
Hey, Spooner.
You see any fog out there?

210
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:46,004
There's no fog out here.
Ladies, you see any fog?

211
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:47,872
l don't see any fog out there.

212
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,572
Did they talk about beautiful women?
Because that's definitely out here.

213
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:53,648
Look at this. Blurring my vision.

214
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:55,952
Spooner, the engine's dead.

215
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,688
Nobody care about that.

216
00:20:57,889 --> 00:21:01,052
You know why? Because we got beer.
And for two, we got beer.

217
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:03,552
And after that, beer.

218
00:21:04,963 --> 00:21:07,523
And we got music too.
That's all that matter, all right?

219
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:09,758
Dance over here
and have some fun.

220
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:13,037
Look at that. My Lord.

221
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:15,300
Yeah.

222
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:19,569
Yeah. You all wanna see
Spooner get low? Let me get low.

223
00:21:21,747 --> 00:21:24,978
Harbor patrol, this is Seagrass.
Do you copy?

224
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:32,213
Coast Guard, this is Seagrass.
Do you copy? Over.

225
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,991
Damn. Wait a second.

226
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:39,163
This new radio is....
l don't know why it does this.

227
00:21:39,364 --> 00:21:41,457
lt's that new song
that starts with the static.

228
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:44,830
lt starts with static then it goes to
the beat and music. Wait a second.

229
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:47,562
What are you doing?
No coats.

230
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:50,037
Coats, bad. Naked, good.

231
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:55,179
lt's freezing out there.

232
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,075
What's going on?

233
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,187
Hell of a fog bank.

234
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:07,958
Where'd that come from?

235
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,334
Hey, Spooner.
What's going on out there, man?

236
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:28,005
Spooner.

237
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:30,238
Dude, do you see this?

238
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:01,739
So l guess New York is just, like,
the best thing ever, huh?

239
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,011
l wouldn't say that.

240
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:06,676
Well, you happy there?

241
00:23:07,686 --> 00:23:09,313
Sometimes.

242
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:14,952
l don't know, Nick.
What do you want me to say?

243
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,492
l don't know. l wake up
one morning and you're gone.

244
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:19,391
No note, nothing.

245
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:22,798
l don't belong on this island, Nick.

246
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,901
The thing l always loved most
about you...

247
00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:29,733
...is you were the one person
who understood that.

248
00:23:33,545 --> 00:23:36,036
The day you left,
l bought you something.

249
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:39,149
-What?
-A ring.

250
00:23:43,021 --> 00:23:44,283
You bought me a ring?

251
00:23:44,489 --> 00:23:47,083
No. But l thought about it.

252
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:50,959
You're such a liar.

253
00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:01,968
-Are you okay?
-l think so.

254
00:24:02,174 --> 00:24:04,233
-What the hell was that?
-Murderers.

255
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:06,377
Nothing but murderers.

256
00:24:06,711 --> 00:24:08,440
Blood for blood.

257
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,478
Father Malone.

258
00:24:15,687 --> 00:24:17,314
Nicholas.

259
00:24:19,357 --> 00:24:20,654
Elizabeth.

260
00:24:27,365 --> 00:24:28,957
Did you see what happened
back there?

261
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:31,965
-l....
-Did something hit us?

262
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:34,700
l didn't see anything.

263
00:24:36,908 --> 00:24:39,035
Looking for my car.

264
00:24:39,711 --> 00:24:43,579
lt's around here somewhere.
l can't....

265
00:24:48,053 --> 00:24:49,247
Sure you're all right?

266
00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:51,989
Yeah.

267
00:24:58,964 --> 00:25:00,989
Man, l can't see nothing.

268
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,166
-What's going on?
-These....

269
00:25:07,205 --> 00:25:09,696
-The hell did you do?
-Nothing. l just called for help.

270
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:13,368
Oh, my God. There's something
right in front of us. Look at that.

271
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,444
Stop. Screaming will get
nothing done.

272
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:22,950
You all right? Calm down.

273
00:25:23,154 --> 00:25:24,644
Just get us out of here, please.

274
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:27,518
You're all right.
You'll be okay, all right?

275
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:30,695
-Are there any lights anywhere?
-Wait. One second.

276
00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:32,794
You okay?

277
00:25:38,603 --> 00:25:40,298
Hello?

278
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:44,768
ls somebody out here?

279
00:25:44,976 --> 00:25:46,466
Hello?

280
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,830
Sean.

281
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:13,527
-Sean.
-Does this radio work?

282
00:26:15,674 --> 00:26:18,404
-lt's gone. lt's gone.
-What?

283
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:20,305
-What is?
-There was a big sailing ship.

284
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:22,946
-Y'all didn't see that ship?
-No.

285
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:25,406
l'm trying to tell you....

286
00:26:26,217 --> 00:26:28,117
lt was right here.

287
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:31,716
Let's just see what the hell
happened to the engine.

288
00:27:01,853 --> 00:27:04,686
Jennifer, what are you doing?

289
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:28,946
-What the hell was that?
-l don't know. l don't know.

290
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:30,978
Dude, let's fix it
and get out of here.

291
00:27:45,296 --> 00:27:48,288
-What the hell is that?
-Don't know.

292
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:05,243
Somebody in there?

293
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:49,217
-You sure you wanna go in there?
-My mom will kill me if l don't.

294
00:28:50,095 --> 00:28:51,926
Call you tomorrow?

295
00:29:01,806 --> 00:29:03,467
Good luck.

296
00:29:13,685 --> 00:29:15,243
Hello?

297
00:29:15,453 --> 00:29:17,182
Who's there?

298
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:19,757
lt's me.

299
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:21,482
Well....

300
00:29:22,393 --> 00:29:25,885
-This is a surprise.
-A good one?

301
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:30,159
Don't see any suitcases. l guess
that means you're not moving back.

302
00:29:30,835 --> 00:29:34,999
l thought you'd be happy
l came back at all.

303
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:38,105
l wish you'd called me. l--

304
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:41,107
l mean, it's not like
l'm running a hotel here.

305
00:29:42,514 --> 00:29:44,709
Good to see you too, Mom.

306
00:29:51,756 --> 00:29:52,882
You waited.

307
00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:55,582
You lasted 30 seconds longer
than l thought you would.

308
00:29:59,397 --> 00:30:01,262
You're learning.

309
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:07,130
Did you say hello for me?

310
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:09,698
So where to now?

311
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:13,599
-Let's go to your place.
-For some wild and crazy sex?

312
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,575
With a strange hitchhiker?

313
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,509
You wish.

314
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:34,317
Elizabeth? Hey.

315
00:31:34,525 --> 00:31:37,016
Hey, it's-- What is it?

316
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:39,158
What's wrong?

317
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:42,127
l....

318
00:31:43,534 --> 00:31:46,002
l keep seeing people...

319
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:48,005
...burning.

320
00:31:50,975 --> 00:31:53,307
And they're screaming.

321
00:31:53,511 --> 00:31:55,445
And l'm watching, and then...

322
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:03,346
And then l'm drowning.

323
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:05,282
lt's just a dream.

324
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:07,825
lt's just a dream.

325
00:32:10,728 --> 00:32:12,753
l've been having them a lot.

326
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:15,765
lt's why l came home.

327
00:32:20,071 --> 00:32:21,595
Come here.

328
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:23,968
Come on.

329
00:35:13,344 --> 00:35:15,244
Elizabeth.

330
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:20,546
Elizabeth.

331
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:38,594
Elizabeth.

332
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,189
Elizabeth.

333
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:08,123
You okay?

334
00:36:08,866 --> 00:36:11,528
What are you doing down here?
lt's freezing. Come on.

335
00:36:11,736 --> 00:36:13,601
Let's go back to bed.

336
00:37:08,526 --> 00:37:10,323
Mom.

337
00:37:11,295 --> 00:37:14,196
Mom, wake up. Look what l found.

338
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:18,864
Andy, what is that?

339
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,971
l found it on the beach
between some rocks. lt's heavy.

340
00:37:22,173 --> 00:37:23,538
Feel.

341
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:28,139
Looks like it must've been somebody's
hairbrush once upon a time.

342
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,139
Want me to make you
some breakfast?

343
00:37:31,349 --> 00:37:33,044
No, l wanna go back
down to the beach.

344
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:34,809
Fine, just a half an hour, okay?

345
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:38,079
l have to go into work early.
l have a very busy day.

346
00:37:38,289 --> 00:37:39,813
Can l come to the station with you?

347
00:37:40,691 --> 00:37:43,387
No. Not today, hon.

348
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:46,324
l have too much work to do.
But maybe later in the week, okay?

349
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:49,489
How's that?

350
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:55,930
Maybe Aunt Connie'll go to the beach
with you and help you find more stuff.

351
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:58,234
No.

352
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:03,175
All she does is eat Ding Dongs
and watch Jeopardy!

353
00:38:04,148 --> 00:38:05,809
l love you.

354
00:38:06,017 --> 00:38:07,882
''Love you too, Mom.''

355
00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:19,884
lt's usually after a storm when
anything's washed up on the beach.

356
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:22,184
Yeah, but we haven't had
a storm in months.

357
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:33,727
-lt's an interesting piece, isn't it?
-Yeah, it is.

358
00:39:33,938 --> 00:39:36,133
-l'll let you know.
-Thanks.

359
00:39:42,813 --> 00:39:45,680
Oh, this is a beautiful piece.

360
00:39:49,587 --> 00:39:51,953
lf it washes up on the beach,
it's ours now, right?

361
00:39:52,156 --> 00:39:54,124
Well, technically speaking.

362
00:39:54,325 --> 00:39:56,316
So, what's it worth?

363
00:40:14,812 --> 00:40:16,677
Hey, Nick.

364
00:40:16,881 --> 00:40:18,678
Stevie, how you doing?

365
00:40:18,883 --> 00:40:21,477
Great. l hear your girl's
back in town.

366
00:40:21,685 --> 00:40:24,882
-Yeah, she is. She's back.
-Good. She's gonna be here a while?

367
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:28,221
Who knows.

368
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:30,257
Yeah, who knows.

369
00:40:35,299 --> 00:40:37,062
Saved by the bell.

370
00:40:39,236 --> 00:40:41,796
Hello? Hey, Uncle Hank.

371
00:41:07,665 --> 00:41:10,293
-Elizabeth?
-Mr. Latham.

372
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:12,526
lt is you. How are you, dear?

373
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:15,304
-Good.
-God, we missed you around here.

374
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,334
What are you up to?

375
00:41:18,676 --> 00:41:21,702
This stamp. l feel like l've
seen it somewhere before.

376
00:41:21,912 --> 00:41:23,641
You recognize it at all?

377
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:27,007
No. Can't say l do.

378
00:41:27,785 --> 00:41:29,980
But l know Prince William lsland.

379
00:41:30,187 --> 00:41:33,418
lt was a big trading post up north.

380
00:41:33,624 --> 00:41:36,718
Gold, seal furs, fox pelts.

381
00:41:36,927 --> 00:41:41,193
They traded with Shanghai
for spices and jade.

382
00:41:41,398 --> 00:41:44,265
A lot of people got rich in a hurry.

383
00:41:44,468 --> 00:41:47,995
So then why did they stop
production suddenly in 1 8 7 1 ?

384
00:41:48,472 --> 00:41:51,202
Nobody lived there
after the outbreak.

385
00:41:52,476 --> 00:41:54,137
What outbreak?

386
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:57,837
Leprosy.
The Chinese brought it over.

387
00:41:58,048 --> 00:42:02,348
Wiped out half the island.
The other half left by ship.

388
00:42:02,553 --> 00:42:05,886
That's as much as l know.
They never came back.

389
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:09,989
-Elizabeth.
-Nick, what's wrong?

390
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:11,252
Hank just called.

391
00:42:11,462 --> 00:42:13,623
Spooner took the Seagrass out
and never came back.

392
00:42:14,098 --> 00:42:15,725
We gotta go.

393
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:29,205
Like l said on the phone...

394
00:42:29,413 --> 00:42:31,472
...l saw them head out
last night at 8:30.

395
00:42:31,682 --> 00:42:33,013
Haven't been heard from since.

396
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:36,277
-And no one's seen her?
-Not that l've heard.

397
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:39,680
-l gotta call the Coast Guard, Nick.
-Don't do that just yet.

398
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,983
They.... They're probably just...

399
00:42:42,192 --> 00:42:44,888
...anchored up the channel
somewhere. We'll go find them.

400
00:42:45,095 --> 00:42:46,892
-Can we use your boat?
-Sure.

401
00:42:47,097 --> 00:42:48,655
Thanks.

402
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,430
Spooner!

403
00:43:32,977 --> 00:43:34,501
Spooner?

404
00:43:34,712 --> 00:43:36,475
Maybe somebody picked him up.

405
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:38,375
Let's hope.

406
00:43:38,582 --> 00:43:40,311
Look at this.

407
00:43:41,986 --> 00:43:43,578
The gauges are all smashed.

408
00:43:45,589 --> 00:43:48,023
Got a half a tank of gas.

409
00:43:49,893 --> 00:43:52,020
The engine still works.

410
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:13,010
Spooner?

411
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:19,747
Sean?

412
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:22,515
Sean?

413
00:44:37,041 --> 00:44:38,099
Nick?

414
00:44:38,308 --> 00:44:40,242
-Nick, what's wrong?
-Sean. He's dead.

415
00:44:40,444 --> 00:44:41,843
-What?
-His eyes....

416
00:44:42,046 --> 00:44:43,206
-What?
-He's dead.

417
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:48,281
No!

418
00:44:48,752 --> 00:44:51,243
Oh, God. Oh, God.

419
00:44:52,456 --> 00:44:54,947
Go inside. Call for help.

420
00:44:58,829 --> 00:45:00,694
Mayday. Mayday.

421
00:45:08,605 --> 00:45:10,163
Hello?

422
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:47,339
No!

423
00:46:20,544 --> 00:46:24,002
Highs in the 60s,
with lows down into the 40s.

424
00:46:24,214 --> 00:46:27,342
In late-breaking news,
local fisherman Nick Castle...

425
00:46:27,551 --> 00:46:29,451
...discovered three dead
and one injured...

426
00:46:29,653 --> 00:46:34,056
...on his boat, the Seagrass, which
had gone missing in last night's fog.

427
00:46:34,258 --> 00:46:35,657
-What?
-The victims' names...

428
00:46:35,859 --> 00:46:38,089
...have not yet been released.

429
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:41,662
Jennifer!

430
00:46:42,399 --> 00:46:44,924
Let me go. Jennifer.

431
00:47:02,786 --> 00:47:04,879
Did he say anything to you two?

432
00:47:05,088 --> 00:47:06,555
Not a word.

433
00:47:06,757 --> 00:47:09,419
Mayor, you still want me
to lock him up?

434
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:14,524
Lock him up for what?

435
00:47:14,798 --> 00:47:16,425
You saw the bodies.

436
00:47:16,633 --> 00:47:19,363
You think they got that way
by accident?

437
00:47:20,971 --> 00:47:25,374
Tom, Coast Guard wants you
on the radio.

438
00:47:31,882 --> 00:47:36,319
You tell your pal, when he thaws out
he better have a damn good story.

439
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:45,255
l hid from it.

440
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:47,929
You hid from what?

441
00:47:48,899 --> 00:47:51,299
lt killed them.

442
00:47:51,635 --> 00:47:53,125
The fog killed them.

443
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:56,862
l hid in the freezer.
lt couldn't get in the freezer.

444
00:47:57,074 --> 00:47:58,541
All right, Spooner, just relax.

445
00:47:58,742 --> 00:48:00,937
You're not making any sense.
You'll be all right.

446
00:48:01,144 --> 00:48:03,339
Okay, guys, we'll take care of him.

447
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:09,045
Okay, come on.
lt's gonna be all right.

448
00:48:09,686 --> 00:48:12,951
lt's okay now. lt's okay.

449
00:48:17,594 --> 00:48:19,824
The fog killed them?

450
00:48:21,632 --> 00:48:25,227
Look. l found this on the boat.
Take it. Keep it safe.

451
00:48:25,435 --> 00:48:26,595
lt's a piece of evidence.

452
00:48:26,803 --> 00:48:29,101
lt might prove
that Spooner's innocent.

453
00:48:29,306 --> 00:48:31,103
Just keep it safe.

454
00:49:11,315 --> 00:49:13,545
Okay.

455
00:49:18,655 --> 00:49:20,384
Let's see.

456
00:49:27,898 --> 00:49:29,297
So you like your gift?

457
00:49:29,499 --> 00:49:32,059
l think it's more for you
than it is for me, Dan.

458
00:49:32,369 --> 00:49:33,734
lt's pretty cool, though, huh?

459
00:49:33,937 --> 00:49:37,338
If I wanted people to see me,
I wouldn't have gone into radio.

460
00:49:37,541 --> 00:49:40,442
-Over and out.
-You hear about the Seagrass?

461
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:42,908
Yeah. Yeah, l did.

462
00:49:45,515 --> 00:49:46,777
Well, l gotta go.

463
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:48,542
-Call me later, okay?
-l will.

464
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:53,486
Somebody please
beam me out of here.

465
00:49:59,563 --> 00:50:00,860
Look at that.

466
00:50:01,064 --> 00:50:03,828
Beautiful women
cavorting around half-naked.

467
00:50:07,771 --> 00:50:10,399
This new radio is....
I don't know why it does this.

468
00:50:10,607 --> 00:50:12,234
-We're going inside.
-No, no.

469
00:50:12,442 --> 00:50:14,239
-Oh, God. It's freezing.
-Wait.

470
00:54:42,746 --> 00:54:45,078
l've got it, Aunt Connie.

471
00:54:47,350 --> 00:54:48,578
-Hello?
-Andy.

472
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:51,276
lt's me. l need you to chill out
and listen to me, okay?

473
00:54:51,488 --> 00:54:53,752
-Okay.
-Where did you find the brush?

474
00:54:54,524 --> 00:54:56,924
On the beach.
Down by the big rock.

475
00:54:57,227 --> 00:55:00,560
Andy, l don't want you to pick up
anything else from the beach...

476
00:55:00,764 --> 00:55:02,356
...unless I'm with you.
Understand?

477
00:55:02,565 --> 00:55:04,192
-Why?
-Andy.

478
00:55:04,601 --> 00:55:06,831
Jeez. Okay, l promise. Bye.

479
00:55:07,337 --> 00:55:08,770
Bye.

480
00:55:11,441 --> 00:55:13,636
What'd your mother want, Andy?

481
00:55:14,444 --> 00:55:16,173
Oh, nothing.

482
00:55:18,014 --> 00:55:20,244
Can l go down to the beach?

483
00:55:21,217 --> 00:55:23,276
Well, just be back before dark, dear.

484
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:25,044
l will.

485
00:55:38,101 --> 00:55:39,932
Father Malone?

486
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:46,737
Father?

487
00:56:08,965 --> 00:56:10,557
Father Malone?

488
00:56:10,934 --> 00:56:12,629
Elizabeth.

489
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:15,700
l'm sorry.
l didn't mean to interrupt you.

490
00:56:15,905 --> 00:56:18,271
Oh, no, no. lt's.... lt's all right.

491
00:56:18,475 --> 00:56:20,875
-What happened?
-l don't know.

492
00:56:23,012 --> 00:56:24,274
What do the words mean?

493
00:56:25,248 --> 00:56:28,684
lt's a phrase from the Bible. lt's....

494
00:56:29,185 --> 00:56:30,914
lt's the writing on the wall.

495
00:56:32,489 --> 00:56:33,683
What have you got there?

496
00:56:39,462 --> 00:56:42,090
l was wondering if
you could help me.

497
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:45,033
lt has your family name in it.

498
00:56:58,081 --> 00:57:00,606
My grandfather told me about this.

499
00:57:02,685 --> 00:57:04,175
Where'd you get it?

500
00:57:04,387 --> 00:57:06,150
ln the boathouse, hidden in the wall.

501
00:57:06,356 --> 00:57:08,153
The boathouse? Which one?

502
00:57:09,058 --> 00:57:12,084
-Nick's.
-Nick Castle.

503
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:14,996
Of course.

504
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:19,167
l'm sorry, Elizabeth,
l really can't help you.

505
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:22,533
Something's happening,
isn't it, Father?

506
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:26,675
l'm very busy right now. Maybe
you should come back another time.

507
00:57:26,876 --> 00:57:30,642
-What's happening, Father?
-Look, you should get off the island.

508
00:57:30,847 --> 00:57:33,782
-What?
-l said, go.

509
00:58:10,787 --> 00:58:12,778
Found this on the Seagrass.

510
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:15,719
They figure it's the knife
that killed Sean.

511
00:58:15,925 --> 00:58:18,052
But that's-- That's my knife.

512
00:58:23,032 --> 00:58:24,499
Nick.

513
00:58:25,435 --> 00:58:27,335
Elizabeth, what happened?

514
00:58:27,570 --> 00:58:28,798
Can we talk outside?

515
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:31,732
No. lt's not a good time.

516
00:58:32,275 --> 00:58:34,140
-lt's important.
-l can't.

517
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:36,369
l can't right now.
Spooner's really in trouble.

518
00:58:36,579 --> 00:58:38,274
Just give me a minute.

519
01:00:24,921 --> 01:00:28,584
Blood for blood.

520
01:00:33,262 --> 01:00:34,752
Elizabeth.

521
01:00:35,365 --> 01:00:37,265
What the hell's going on here?

522
01:00:40,603 --> 01:00:42,503
What happened? Are you okay?

523
01:00:51,114 --> 01:00:52,945
Thanks.

524
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:59,554
Here. Drink this.
lt'll help you relax.

525
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:02,617
l don't wanna relax.

526
01:01:02,925 --> 01:01:04,449
You don't believe me, do you?

527
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:07,186
Elizabeth, three people were
just found dead on my boat...

528
01:01:07,397 --> 01:01:11,299
...my business is shot, and Malone's
trying to nail Spooner for murder.

529
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:14,436
-What do you want me to do?
-You think l would make all this up?

530
01:01:14,637 --> 01:01:16,502
l didn't say that.

531
01:01:16,906 --> 01:01:18,203
lt's not just me, Nick.

532
01:01:18,408 --> 01:01:20,672
Father Malone's leaving.
And Spooner wasn't lying.

533
01:01:20,877 --> 01:01:22,742
He didn't touch Sean.
l saw it on the tape.

534
01:01:22,945 --> 01:01:24,412
Where is the tape? Let me see it.

535
01:01:25,615 --> 01:01:28,049
-l lost it.
-You what?

536
01:01:28,451 --> 01:01:29,941
l know. lt fell in the water.

537
01:01:30,153 --> 01:01:31,450
When you were drowning?

538
01:01:31,654 --> 01:01:33,417
l know how this sounds, okay?

539
01:01:33,923 --> 01:01:36,050
Yeah, it's a really good thing
you found this.

540
01:01:38,995 --> 01:01:43,261
Nick, ever since l came home,
horrible things have been happening.

541
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,901
The answers are in here somehow.
Just--

542
01:01:47,670 --> 01:01:49,535
Just look at it.

543
01:01:50,139 --> 01:01:52,539
lt describes my dream, Nick.

544
01:01:52,742 --> 01:01:54,334
All of it.

545
01:01:58,948 --> 01:02:02,406
One of the founding fathers
wrote it. Patrick Malone.

546
01:02:05,121 --> 01:02:07,453
'''May God forgive my soul.'

547
01:02:07,657 --> 01:02:10,285
l say these words,
but in my heart l wonder...

548
01:02:10,493 --> 01:02:14,327
...can God forgive any man for a sin as
great as the one l'm about to commit?''

549
01:02:14,530 --> 01:02:16,521
Wait a second, let me see this.

550
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:25,735
''l tell myself this is the only means
by which our family can survive...

551
01:02:25,942 --> 01:02:28,638
...the conditions on
this beleaguered island.

552
01:02:29,278 --> 01:02:32,304
But it does not soothe the horror l feel
for being an accomp--''

553
01:02:32,515 --> 01:02:34,380
Accomplice to what?

554
01:02:38,955 --> 01:02:41,685
-What is it?
-These photographs.

555
01:02:41,891 --> 01:02:43,324
The dates.

556
01:02:43,526 --> 01:02:46,359
1 867, '69.

557
01:02:46,562 --> 01:02:49,258
Just shacks, huts, cabins.

558
01:02:49,465 --> 01:02:51,956
Then 1 8 7 1 .

559
01:02:53,136 --> 01:02:55,127
A town springs up.

560
01:03:03,279 --> 01:03:06,442
Look at these.
lt's the same thing here.

561
01:03:06,649 --> 01:03:08,617
Look how much everything's grown.

562
01:03:08,818 --> 01:03:11,309
Something definitely
happened in 1 8 7 1 .

563
01:03:11,654 --> 01:03:13,849
Same date as the journal.

564
01:03:15,858 --> 01:03:18,053
What turned it all around?

565
01:03:21,831 --> 01:03:23,389
Malone.

566
01:03:25,001 --> 01:03:26,468
Williams.

567
01:03:27,570 --> 01:03:29,094
Castle.

568
01:03:29,906 --> 01:03:31,237
Wayne.

569
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:35,000
Are we resolved
to protect this island?

570
01:03:35,211 --> 01:03:36,735
Aye.

571
01:03:55,398 --> 01:03:57,195
l was outside the door,
like you said.

572
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:59,231
Must've gone out the window.

573
01:03:59,435 --> 01:04:01,130
You think?

574
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:15,929
Oh, my.

575
01:07:30,112 --> 01:07:32,103
Hi, Dan. So, what is it this time?

576
01:07:32,314 --> 01:07:35,181
A swarm of locusts?
A tornado maybe?

577
01:07:35,384 --> 01:07:37,011
Nope. Just fog.

578
01:07:37,219 --> 01:07:38,516
You're kidding, right?

579
01:07:38,721 --> 01:07:41,884
No. lt swallowed us up out here at
the station a couple of minutes ago.

580
01:07:42,091 --> 01:07:45,185
lt's moving your way.
lt's kind of cool, actually.

581
01:07:45,394 --> 01:07:46,793
Hang on a sec.

582
01:07:59,875 --> 01:08:02,400
Oh, man.
All the lights just went out.

583
01:08:02,611 --> 01:08:05,603
-Everything's dead.
-Everything but your computer, right?

584
01:08:05,981 --> 01:08:09,109
-Batteries.
-Lucky me.

585
01:08:19,728 --> 01:08:21,958
-Dan, where'd you go?
-That's great.

586
01:08:22,164 --> 01:08:23,722
Dan?

587
01:08:25,634 --> 01:08:27,829
Dan? What is that?
What's happening?

588
01:08:28,037 --> 01:08:29,368
-Someone's at the door.
-Dan...

589
01:08:29,572 --> 01:08:31,267
...listen to me.
Don't open the door.

590
01:08:31,474 --> 01:08:34,841
l'm just gonna check this out.
Hang on a second, sweetheart.

591
01:08:40,349 --> 01:08:42,544
Yeah, just give me
a second here, all right?

592
01:08:42,751 --> 01:08:44,548
Dan, don't open the door.

593
01:08:44,753 --> 01:08:46,050
Don't worry about me, darling.

594
01:08:46,255 --> 01:08:48,382
Big Dan's got everything
under control.

595
01:08:49,859 --> 01:08:51,053
Dan?

596
01:08:53,662 --> 01:08:56,290
Dan, is everything all right?

597
01:09:00,569 --> 01:09:01,695
Dan?

598
01:09:06,575 --> 01:09:08,770
This some kind of joke?

599
01:09:28,731 --> 01:09:30,323
That's weird.

600
01:09:43,579 --> 01:09:45,137
Dan?

601
01:10:12,908 --> 01:10:14,808
-Chris?
-''Shorts'' for 2000.

602
01:10:20,149 --> 01:10:21,309
Andy?

603
01:10:22,218 --> 01:10:25,187
Please pick up. Please pick up.
Please pick up.

604
01:10:29,825 --> 01:10:32,555
-Inez?
-What is Borneo?

605
01:10:45,374 --> 01:10:46,341
Hello?

606
01:10:49,211 --> 01:10:51,145
Hello? Hello?

607
01:10:58,387 --> 01:11:01,083
And all of us living here today
owe a debt of gratitude...

608
01:11:01,290 --> 01:11:02,757
...to these four brave men...

609
01:11:02,958 --> 01:11:05,756
...who struggled
and withstood and sacrificed...

610
01:11:05,961 --> 01:11:09,727
...in order that this island might grow
and prosper into what it is today.

611
01:11:19,642 --> 01:11:21,940
Oh, God, Andy.

612
01:11:22,511 --> 01:11:24,672
Maybe we should close
all the windows.

613
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:28,077
You better check your bedroom.
l'll go check your mother's.

614
01:11:35,791 --> 01:11:37,622
lt wants us.

615
01:11:39,495 --> 01:11:41,827
This is really weird.
l'll go get the truck.

616
01:11:42,031 --> 01:11:45,467
l think it's just a power outage.
l'm sure it's temporary.

617
01:11:45,668 --> 01:11:47,932
l think it's best that everybody
just go home.

618
01:11:48,137 --> 01:11:50,071
l don't think it's anything
to worry about.

619
01:11:50,272 --> 01:11:54,038
All right. You heard the mayor.
Let's call it a night.

620
01:12:10,526 --> 01:12:11,720
This is an emergency.

621
01:12:11,927 --> 01:12:13,758
There's been a fire
at the weather station.

622
01:12:13,962 --> 01:12:17,090
Dan has been killed. lf anybody can
hear me, please check on my son.

623
01:12:17,299 --> 01:12:19,733
The phone lines are down.
Please check on my son.

624
01:12:19,935 --> 01:12:21,402
There is something in the fog.

625
01:12:21,603 --> 01:12:25,130
Please. I cannot reach him.
He's at 88 7 White Beach Road.

626
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:27,275
Mommy's coming, Andy.
Mommy's coming.

627
01:12:27,476 --> 01:12:30,570
Elizabeth, get in.
Stevie's son's in trouble. We gotta go.

628
01:12:30,779 --> 01:12:32,770
l heard her on the radio. Come on.

629
01:12:54,470 --> 01:12:58,099
''April 1 0th. Met with Blake tonight
for the first time.

630
01:12:58,674 --> 01:13:01,438
He stood in the shadows to
prevent me from seeing his face.''

631
01:13:01,643 --> 01:13:04,806
-Who's Blake?
-l don't know.

632
01:13:06,882 --> 01:13:08,008
Nick, listen to this.

633
01:13:08,617 --> 01:13:10,676
''Blake's proposition is simple.

634
01:13:10,886 --> 01:13:14,686
He wishes to purchase half of the
island as a new home for his people.

635
01:13:15,691 --> 01:13:18,057
He and his followers are
traveling down the coast...

636
01:13:18,260 --> 01:13:20,353
...in a clipper ship called
the Elizabeth Dane.''

637
01:13:21,296 --> 01:13:23,958
Spooner said he saw a clipper ship
last night in the fog.

638
01:14:13,715 --> 01:14:15,273
Nick, watch out!

639
01:14:36,371 --> 01:14:37,497
God.

640
01:15:59,054 --> 01:16:00,453
Come on.

641
01:16:00,722 --> 01:16:02,485
Damn it.

642
01:16:03,725 --> 01:16:05,022
Come on.

643
01:16:05,227 --> 01:16:06,694
Come on.

644
01:16:20,576 --> 01:16:21,975
Oh, come on.

645
01:19:19,621 --> 01:19:20,815
We're not gonna make it.

646
01:19:21,056 --> 01:19:23,286
lt's coming up the coast.
We're going the back way.

647
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:07,760
Elizabeth, turn the truck around.
Keep it running.

648
01:20:26,955 --> 01:20:29,219
Come on.
Andy, get out of there.

649
01:20:33,628 --> 01:20:37,587
Get out of there. Come on.
Grab my hand. Come on, run.

650
01:20:42,204 --> 01:20:44,434
Let's go get in the truck.
Go on, get in the truck.

651
01:20:45,740 --> 01:20:47,867
We gotta get out of here.
Go, go, go.

652
01:20:48,076 --> 01:20:50,237
Let's go. Elizabeth, let's go.

653
01:20:50,445 --> 01:20:52,675
Come on. Put it in gear,
we gotta get out of here.

654
01:20:52,881 --> 01:20:53,939
-Shit.
-Go. Come on!

655
01:20:54,149 --> 01:20:55,343
lt's stuck.

656
01:20:59,020 --> 01:21:00,214
-Go.
-What the hell is that?

657
01:21:00,455 --> 01:21:02,013
Come on, l don't know.

658
01:21:03,358 --> 01:21:05,189
You trade with me.

659
01:21:07,229 --> 01:21:08,628
Slide over.

660
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:25,646
Nick. Nick, look out!

661
01:21:36,758 --> 01:21:38,623
Where are we going?

662
01:21:39,094 --> 01:21:42,029
To the lighthouse, to your mom.
Then we're getting off this island.

663
01:21:42,230 --> 01:21:45,358
We have to go to the town hall
to get my mother. She was just there.

664
01:21:45,767 --> 01:21:48,565
Try the Marina Loop.
Maybe we'll make it through.

665
01:21:53,275 --> 01:21:55,573
l ain't sticking around here,
waiting to get killed.

666
01:21:56,344 --> 01:21:58,209
l'm the hell off this island.

667
01:22:08,823 --> 01:22:11,257
All packed up, huh?

668
01:22:14,562 --> 01:22:16,587
l don't think the ferry's
running tonight.

669
01:22:20,535 --> 01:22:21,593
You been drinking?

670
01:22:23,004 --> 01:22:27,737
lt means, ''You've been weighed
in the balance and found wanting.''

671
01:22:28,109 --> 01:22:30,077
l'll take that as a yes.

672
01:22:31,212 --> 01:22:33,180
l need a drink myself.

673
01:22:33,481 --> 01:22:35,949
l figure one of these keys
goes to one of these boats.

674
01:22:36,151 --> 01:22:37,618
We could--

675
01:22:42,490 --> 01:22:43,787
Oh, my God.

676
01:22:51,533 --> 01:22:54,525
Come on. Come on.

677
01:23:06,982 --> 01:23:09,450
lt's too thick.
l can't see through this.

678
01:23:41,349 --> 01:23:42,941
Our journey's over.

679
01:23:43,151 --> 01:23:44,982
We are almost home.

680
01:23:52,260 --> 01:23:54,694
The contract, Mr. Malone.

681
01:24:11,112 --> 01:24:12,841
A new home.

682
01:24:14,482 --> 01:24:15,676
Where's the rest?

683
01:24:16,518 --> 01:24:18,509
We've come for all of it, Mr. Blake.

684
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:21,917
You give us everything, and you
escape here with your wretched lives.

685
01:24:22,957 --> 01:24:25,653
That's not the deal we made,
Mr. Malone.

686
01:24:25,860 --> 01:24:28,090
Well, that matters little now,
Mr. Blake.

687
01:24:55,090 --> 01:24:56,682
Elizabeth?

688
01:24:56,891 --> 01:24:58,586
Nick?

689
01:24:58,860 --> 01:25:00,828
Elizabeth?

690
01:25:01,863 --> 01:25:05,060
-Elizabeth?
-Nick?

691
01:25:05,266 --> 01:25:07,131
Where are you?

692
01:25:08,570 --> 01:25:11,801
Stay there. l can see you.

693
01:25:16,277 --> 01:25:17,972
Elizabeth.

694
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:21,610
l'm sorry. l don't know what it is.

695
01:25:21,850 --> 01:25:25,149
-Elizabeth.
-Nick.

696
01:25:25,353 --> 01:25:27,082
Oh, man. You all right?

697
01:25:27,288 --> 01:25:28,812
You okay?

698
01:25:30,391 --> 01:25:33,588
-Hey, come on. We gotta go.
-l can't leave without my dogs, Nick.

699
01:25:33,795 --> 01:25:35,592
They'll be fine.
We'll come back tomorrow.

700
01:25:35,797 --> 01:25:37,594
Look at me, Nick.

701
01:25:38,299 --> 01:25:40,426
Those dogs are all l got.

702
01:25:45,607 --> 01:25:47,165
Billy.

703
01:25:47,375 --> 01:25:48,740
There's people over there.

704
01:25:48,977 --> 01:25:50,376
Brutus.

705
01:25:58,786 --> 01:26:01,516
We gotta go. Come on.

706
01:26:16,070 --> 01:26:17,901
What was that?

707
01:26:20,074 --> 01:26:21,905
Andy.

708
01:26:23,778 --> 01:26:25,143
Thank God you're okay.

709
01:26:25,947 --> 01:26:29,974
l tried to reach you,
but l crashed my car.

710
01:26:30,552 --> 01:26:31,883
Thank God.

711
01:26:34,756 --> 01:26:36,815
We gotta go.
Come on, let's go.

712
01:26:37,025 --> 01:26:38,356
-Come on.
-Come on.

713
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:40,653
lnside. Hurry up.

714
01:27:14,462 --> 01:27:17,056
You miserable bastards.

715
01:27:43,157 --> 01:27:45,591
Help us! Please!

716
01:28:02,510 --> 01:28:04,171
Blood for blood.

717
01:29:20,621 --> 01:29:22,316
Elizabeth?

718
01:29:22,924 --> 01:29:24,118
Elizabeth.

719
01:29:25,793 --> 01:29:27,158
Come on.

720
01:29:41,909 --> 01:29:43,035
You make a decision.

721
01:29:43,244 --> 01:29:45,405
Elizabeth, are you okay?

722
01:29:53,154 --> 01:29:54,917
Hello, is anybody in there?

723
01:29:55,123 --> 01:29:58,251
-Spooner?
-Yeah, come on. Open the door, man.

724
01:29:58,459 --> 01:30:01,622
-Come on.
-lt's crazy out there, man.

725
01:30:01,829 --> 01:30:04,059
-Hell is going on?
-We gotta lock this place down.

726
01:30:04,265 --> 01:30:08,167
Windows, doors, everything.
Spooner, help me out. Come on.

727
01:30:17,345 --> 01:30:18,835
So now you know.

728
01:30:20,281 --> 01:30:22,875
That our forefathers murdered
every man, woman and child...

729
01:30:23,084 --> 01:30:24,346
...on the Elizabeth Dane?

730
01:30:24,552 --> 01:30:27,282
And this town was built
on nothing but lies?

731
01:30:27,488 --> 01:30:29,979
And now they've come
for their revenge.

732
01:30:41,669 --> 01:30:43,159
They're everywhere.

733
01:30:43,571 --> 01:30:45,937
The land that Blake paid for...

734
01:30:46,140 --> 01:30:47,801
...where is it?

735
01:30:48,009 --> 01:30:49,738
We're on it.

736
01:30:50,478 --> 01:30:52,571
The whole town was built on it.

737
01:30:53,648 --> 01:30:56,549
The sins of the fathers are visited
on the heads of the children.

738
01:30:56,751 --> 01:30:59,982
-The hell are you talking about?
-The ramblings of a dying old man.

739
01:31:00,188 --> 01:31:02,349
My grandfather knew the truth
about his ancestors.

740
01:31:02,557 --> 01:31:03,990
My father was a madman.

741
01:31:04,192 --> 01:31:07,059
We're the children of murderers.
All of us.

742
01:31:07,261 --> 01:31:11,595
Wayne, Castle, Williams, Malone.

743
01:31:11,799 --> 01:31:13,061
But we haven't done anything.

744
01:31:13,267 --> 01:31:15,428
Yeah, keep my father out of this.
We from Chicago.

745
01:31:15,636 --> 01:31:18,969
lt's time to put an end to this,
once and for all.

746
01:31:57,912 --> 01:31:59,345
No!

747
01:32:00,348 --> 01:32:02,145
No. Come on.

748
01:33:39,780 --> 01:33:40,872
No!

749
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:47,444
No!

750
01:33:50,791 --> 01:33:52,315
Malone.

751
01:34:27,962 --> 01:34:29,657
Elizabeth.

752
01:35:14,875 --> 01:35:17,309
Elizabeth. Elizabeth, wait.

753
01:35:26,687 --> 01:35:30,851
Please. l've done nothing
to deserve this.

754
01:35:31,058 --> 01:35:33,891
That matters little now.

755
01:35:34,829 --> 01:35:35,955
Please.

756
01:35:37,832 --> 01:35:40,562
The contract.

757
01:36:57,611 --> 01:36:59,511
Let's go.

758
03:15:47,722 --> 03:15:49,553
Elizabeth?

759
03:16:15,350 --> 03:16:18,285
No. Elizabeth.

760
03:16:22,390 --> 03:16:24,290
Elizabeth?

761
03:16:57,525 --> 03:17:03,327
I don't think any of us can say
exactly what happened last night.

762
03:17:04,499 --> 03:17:07,559
But if this...

763
03:17:08,870 --> 03:17:11,737
...has been anything more
than just a nightmare...

764
03:17:12,206 --> 03:17:15,175
...then why?

765
03:17:15,710 --> 03:17:17,541
Did it come back for revenge...

766
03:17:18,513 --> 03:17:20,708
...or justice?

767
03:17:20,915 --> 03:17:24,578
Or maybe to claim something
lost long, long ago.

768
03:17:26,287 --> 03:17:28,517
Maybe we'll never know.

769
03:17:28,723 --> 03:17:31,248
But one thing's for sure...

770
03:17:31,459 --> 03:17:35,623
...something did come back
from the sea.

771
03:17:36,064 --> 03:17:39,727
Sooner or later, everything does.
