1
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:19,969
England

2
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:40,969
-I finished my play.
-Well done.

3
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:42,099
Have you seen Mummy?

4
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,020
Well, she'll be in the drawing room, I expect.

5
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:47,439
I hope you're not gonna be getting under
our feet today, Miss Briony.

6
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,020
We got a dinner for 10 to prepare.

7
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:05,870
-Hello, pal, I hear you're putting on a play.
-Who told you?

8
00:03:05,949 --> 00:03:07,370
Jungle drums.

9
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:12,669
-Will you come and see it?
-I'm not sure that would be quite...

10
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:13,919
Why don't you let me read it?

11
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,420
You used to make me those beautiful
bound copies of all your stories.

12
00:03:16,509 --> 00:03:18,800
-I've kept them all.
-I still want you to come.

13
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,849
-Let's see.
-I have to go now.

14
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:28,599
Mummy, I need you!

15
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:37,939
Stupendous. It's stupendous, darling.
Your first play.

16
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,699
Do you think so?
Do you think Leon will like it?

17
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,069
Well, of course he will.

18
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,870
The Trials of Arabella, by Briony Tallis.

19
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:57,259
Cee.
-Yes?

20
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,050
What do you think it would feel like
to be someone else?

21
00:04:01,129 --> 00:04:03,300
Cooler, I should hope.

22
00:04:03,389 --> 00:04:06,060
-I'm worried about the play.
-I'm sure it's a masterpiece.

23
00:04:06,139 --> 00:04:09,060
But we only have the afternoon to rehearse.
What if the twins can't act?

24
00:04:09,139 --> 00:04:11,810
You have to be nice to them.
I wonder how'd you feel if your mother

25
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:15,819
had run off with Mr What's-his-name
who reads the news on the wireless?

26
00:04:16,569 --> 00:04:19,319
Perhaps I should have written Leon a story.

27
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:22,699
If you write a story, you only have to
say the word "castle," and you could see

28
00:04:22,779 --> 00:04:25,620
the towers and the woods
and the village below, but...

29
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:28,620
In a play, it's...

30
00:04:28,699 --> 00:04:31,870
It all depends on other people.

31
00:04:32,459 --> 00:04:34,170
-Cee.
-Yes?

32
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:38,129
Why don't you talk to Robbie any more?

33
00:04:38,209 --> 00:04:41,509
I do.
We just move in different circles, that's all.

34
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:57,110
-Do we have to do a play?
-Why do we have to?

35
00:04:57,189 --> 00:05:00,110
-It's to celebrate my brother Leon's visit.
I hate plays.

36
00:05:00,189 --> 00:05:02,529
So do l.
-How can you hate plays?

37
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:05,779
-It's just showing off.
-You'll be in this play or you'll get a clout.

38
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:08,910
-And I'll tell the parents.
You're not allowed to clout us.

39
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:12,709
We're guests in this house. And what did
the parents say we were to make ourselves?

40
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:14,500
-Well, Pierrot?
-Amenable.

41
00:05:14,579 --> 00:05:16,459
-Jackson?
-Amenable.

42
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,250
Amenable, that's right.

43
00:05:20,509 --> 00:05:22,720
Now, Briony, what's your play about?

44
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:26,759
Well, it's about how

45
00:05:27,009 --> 00:05:30,100
love is all very well,
but you have to be sensible.

46
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,230
-I suppose you're going to be Arabella.
-Well, not necessarily.

47
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:34,810
-In that case, do you mind if I play her?
Lola was in the school play.

48
00:05:34,889 --> 00:05:39,110
Do say yes. It'd be the first decent thing
to happen to me in months.

49
00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:41,860
Well, yes, all right.

50
00:05:43,529 --> 00:05:45,149
I suppose we should start by reading it.

51
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,319
If you're going to be Arabella, then I'll be
the director, thank you very much.

52
00:05:48,409 --> 00:05:49,579
Sorry.

53
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,659
I'm going to do the prologue.

54
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:58,420
"Prologue.

55
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:02,259
"This is the tale of spontaneous Arabella,

56
00:06:02,339 --> 00:06:05,089
"who ran away with an extrinsic fellow.

57
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:07,759
"It grieved her parents to see their firstborn

58
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:09,850
"evanesce from her home
to go to Eastbourne."

59
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:12,100
Yes?

60
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:18,649
-Nothing. Just thought I'd watch.
Rehearsals are private, I'm afraid.

61
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:20,860
You can see the play this evening.

62
00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:24,189
-I'll have to work then.
-Well, I'm sorry, Danny.

63
00:06:24,569 --> 00:06:27,160
Can we go for a swim now?
Yes, yes, yes!

64
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:31,410
-No, I don't really think there's time!
Cecilia will let us.

65
00:06:31,529 --> 00:06:34,500
I'm sure a half-hour break
would do us all good.

66
00:06:34,579 --> 00:06:36,790
Cecilia? Cecilia!

67
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:39,670
Cecilia!

68
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:51,220
Cecilia! Cecilia, Cecilia.
Please, can we go for a swim, Cecilia?

69
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:54,720
Yes, I don't see why not.
Don't go out of your depth!

70
00:10:10,419 --> 00:10:13,379
Can you do me
one of your Bolshevik roll-ups?

71
00:10:19,259 --> 00:10:22,639
Beautiful day.
-I suppose so. Too hot for me.

72
00:10:24,809 --> 00:10:26,600
-Are you enjoying your book?
-No, not really.

73
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:27,769
It gets better.

74
00:10:28,269 --> 00:10:30,440
I prefer Fielding any day.

75
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:35,950
Much more passionate.

76
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:52,419
-Leon's coming down today, did you know?
-I heard a rumour.

77
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,470
He's bringing a friend with him.
It's Paul Marshall, the chocolate millionaire.

78
00:10:55,549 --> 00:10:58,179
-Are the flowers for him?
-Why shouldn't they be?

79
00:10:58,259 --> 00:11:00,470
Leon says he's very charming.

80
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:05,480
The Old Man telephoned last night.
He says you're planning on being a doctor.

81
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:07,769
-I'm thinking about it, yes.
-Another six years of student life.

82
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:09,980
-How else do you become a doctor?
-You could get a fellowship, now,

83
00:11:10,059 --> 00:11:11,649
-couldn't you? With your First?
-I don't want to teach.

84
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,240
I said I'd pay your father back.

85
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,159
That's not what I meant at all.

86
00:11:30,629 --> 00:11:32,340
-Let me help with that.
-No, I'm all right, thanks.

87
00:11:32,419 --> 00:11:34,669
-Take the flowers. Take the flowers.
-I'm all right. I'm all right.

88
00:11:39,379 --> 00:11:41,549
Oh, you idiot.

89
00:11:43,429 --> 00:11:45,389
Do you realise that's probably
the most valuable thing we own?

90
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:47,429
Not any more, it isn't.

91
00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:50,480
Careful!

92
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:10,730
I'm...

93
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:34,179
Hello, Robbie!

94
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:41,610
No need to encourage him.

95
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:54,039
Cee?

96
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,039
Mother?

97
00:15:01,539 --> 00:15:04,960
-Where is everyone, Danny?
-I don't know, sir.

98
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:07,470
Sir.
Gasping for a drink.

99
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:12,350
-Will you have one?
Rather.

100
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:14,970
-Whisky?
-Please.

101
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:21,309
-Leon!
-Here she is.

102
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:26,279
Oh, I've missed you.
I've been going completely doolally up here.

103
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,909
-This is my sister, Cecilia. Paul Marshall.
-I've heard an awful lot about you.

104
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:32,240
-Likewise.
Where are we putting him?

105
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:35,659
In the blue room. Mother's lying down,
she's got one of her migraines.

106
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:38,159
I'm not surprised, with this heat.

107
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:43,169
It's the big room next to the nursery.

108
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:50,009
Is the Old Man staying in town?

109
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:52,759
Looks like it.
Some sort of rush on at the Ministry.

110
00:16:09,529 --> 00:16:12,779
So aren't we doing the play?
No.

111
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:15,789
Why not?
-Don't ask me.

112
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,539
I don't like it here.

113
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,750
There's always a problem
when a new brand comes about.

114
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:24,750
The remarketing, the re-packaging,
the re-shaping.

115
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,960
Even the re-flavouring in some cases,
or whole new technology.

116
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:31,470
I think our main challenge is whether or not
to launch the new Amo Bar.

117
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:35,259
The Army Amo. Do you see? Pass the Amo?

118
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:38,139
My source at the Ministry is very reliable,

119
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,639
I used to clean his shoes at Harrow,
informs me we have a good chance

120
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:42,690
of including it
in the standard issue ration pack.

121
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,649
Which means that I'd have to open
at least three more factories.

122
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:48,029
More if they bring in conscription,
which I say is bound to happen

123
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:49,610
if Herr Hitler doesn't pipe down.

124
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:51,860
He's about as likely to do that as buy shares

125
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:54,279
in Marks and Spencer's,
wouldn't you agree?

126
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:57,370
-This isn't very good.
-I make a cocktail with crushed ice,

127
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:01,120
rum and melted dark chocolate.
It's absolutely scrumptious.

128
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,970
Guess who we met on the way in?
-Robbie.

129
00:17:11,049 --> 00:17:14,140
-I told him to join us tonight.
-Oh, Leon, you didn't.

130
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:20,099
So, Robbie, the housekeeper's son,
whose father did a bunk 20 years ago,

131
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:23,900
gets a scholarship to the local grammar,
the Old Man puts him through Cambridge,

132
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:28,359
goes up at the same time as Cee, and
for three years she hardly speaks to him.

133
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,490
Wouldn't let him within a mile
of her Roedean chums.

134
00:17:30,569 --> 00:17:32,450
Anyone got a cigarette?

135
00:17:32,529 --> 00:17:35,279
I don't know what the hell he's doing
these days, messing about in flower beds.

136
00:17:35,369 --> 00:17:37,529
As a matter of fact, he's planning on doing
a medical degree.

137
00:17:37,869 --> 00:17:40,289
And the Old Man said yes to that?

138
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:47,000
Look, I really think you should go down
to the lodge and ask him not to come.

139
00:17:47,089 --> 00:17:49,799
Why? Has something happened
between you?

140
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:52,380
For God's sake.

141
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,750
-When can we go home?
Soon.

142
00:18:23,829 --> 00:18:26,079
We can't go home. It's a divorce.

143
00:18:28,539 --> 00:18:31,710
-How dare you say that?
-Well, it's true!

144
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:35,299
You will never, ever use that word
again! Do you understand?

145
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:39,890
-Now what are we going to do?
-I'm always asking myself that.

146
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:43,930
My name is Paul Marshall.
You must be the cousins from the north.

147
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,190
-What are your names?
-Pierrot.

148
00:18:46,269 --> 00:18:48,559
-Jackson.
-What marvellous names.

149
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:50,900
Do you know our parents?

150
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,400
Well, I've read
about them in the paper.

151
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:57,029
-What exactly have you read about them?
-Oh, you know. The usual sort of nonsense.

152
00:18:57,109 --> 00:19:00,990
I'll thank you not to talk about this
in front of the children.

153
00:19:05,579 --> 00:19:07,539
Your parents
are absolutely wonderful people,

154
00:19:07,619 --> 00:19:11,920
that's quite clear, and they love you
and think about you all the time.

155
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,549
Jolly nice slacks.

156
00:19:15,509 --> 00:19:17,259
We went to see a show
and I got them at Liberty's.

157
00:19:17,339 --> 00:19:20,640
-What was the show?
-Hamlet.

158
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,180
Ah, yes. "To be or not to be."

159
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,940
I like your shoes.

160
00:19:32,859 --> 00:19:38,569
Duckers in the Turl. They make
a wooden thing, shaped like your foot.

161
00:19:39,069 --> 00:19:40,660
Keep it forever.

162
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,789
I'm starving. When's dinner?

163
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:47,869
Well, I might be able to help you there,
if you can guess what I do for a living.

164
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,539
-You've got a chocolate factory.
-Everyone knows that.

165
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:53,460
Then it wasn't a guess, was it?

166
00:19:53,549 --> 00:19:57,509
There'll be one of these in every kit bag
of every soldier in the British Army.

167
00:19:57,589 --> 00:19:59,720
Sugar casing, so it won't melt.

168
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:01,930
Why should they get free sweets?

169
00:20:02,009 --> 00:20:03,509
'Cause they'll be fighting for their country.

170
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:05,930
Our daddy says
there isn't going to be a war.

171
00:20:06,019 --> 00:20:08,180
Your daddy is wrong.

172
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:13,769
-Calling it the Army Amo.
-Amo, amas, amat.

173
00:20:13,859 --> 00:20:15,980
Top marks.

174
00:20:16,069 --> 00:20:20,609
It's boring how everything ends in "o."
"Polo" and "Aero."

175
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,319
-And "Oxo" and "Brillo".
-Sounds as if you don't want it.

176
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:26,539
Then I shall just have to give it
to your sister.

177
00:20:37,049 --> 00:20:38,130
Bite it.

178
00:20:40,299 --> 00:20:42,049
You have to bite it.

179
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:54,150
The Princess was well aware
of his remorseless wickedness.

180
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:57,859
But that made it no easier to overcome
the voluminous love she felt

181
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:01,109
in her heart for Sir Romulus.
The Princess knew instinctively

182
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,240
that the one with red hair
was not to be trusted.

183
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:06,740
As his young ward dived again
and again to the depths of the lake,

184
00:21:06,829 --> 00:21:11,039
in search of the enchanted chalice,
Sir Romulus twirled his luxuriant moustache.

185
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:15,710
Sir Romulus rode with his two companions,
northwards, drawing ever closer

186
00:21:15,789 --> 00:21:17,049
to an effulgent sea.

187
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:20,339
So heroic in manner,
he appeared so valiant in word

188
00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:23,839
no one could ever guess at the darkness

189
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:26,509
lurking in the black heart
of Sir Romulus Turnbull.

190
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:29,519
He was the most dangerous man
in the world.

191
00:21:37,819 --> 00:21:41,279
"Dear Cecilia, I thought I should write
to apologise for my clumsy

192
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:43,240
"and inconsiderate behaviour."

193
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:15,000
"Forgive me if I seem strange but I'm..."

194
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:44,589
Dear Cecilia, you'd be forgiven
for thinking me mad,

195
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:46,460
the way I acted this afternoon.

196
00:24:46,549 --> 00:24:50,589
The truth is I feel rather lightheaded
and foolish in your presence, Cee,

197
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:53,009
and I don't think I can blame the heat.

198
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:56,259
"Will you forgive me?

199
00:24:59,309 --> 00:25:00,599
"Robbie."

200
00:25:18,039 --> 00:25:19,619
Off out then?

201
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:22,289
Yes, Leon's asked me
to join them for dinner.

202
00:25:23,289 --> 00:25:26,839
So that's why I've been polishing
silver all afternoon.

203
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:30,130
I'll think of you when I see my face
in the spoon.

204
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:38,390
You're not a bit like your father.
Not in any way.

205
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:41,309
That's because I'm all yours. I'll be late.

206
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,859
Your shirts are hanging upstairs.

207
00:25:49,319 --> 00:25:51,440
-Son.
-Yes?

208
00:25:52,109 --> 00:25:53,529
Nothing.

209
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:48,130
Briony! Is that you?

210
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:12,690
Are you all right?

211
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,700
Do you think you could do me a favour?

212
00:27:19,369 --> 00:27:22,619
Could you run ahead
and give this to Cee? I...

213
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:27,420
-Feel a bit of a fool handing it over myself.
-All right.

214
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:54,400
Briony.

215
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:23,180
Briony!

216
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,910
-I suppose he's what you might call eligible.
-Rather.

217
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:48,160
He certainly seems to think
he's the cat's pyjamas.

218
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:51,579
Which is odd, considering he has pubic hair
growing out of his ears.

219
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:55,130
I should imagine he'd give you
a lot of very noisy, boneheaded sons.

220
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:57,589
-He's quite a good egg, actually.
-You say that about everyone.

221
00:28:57,670 --> 00:29:01,470
-Leon!
-Rummy, if it ain't my little sis!

222
00:29:01,549 --> 00:29:04,549
I wrote you a play, Leon.
I wanted to do a play for you.

223
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,430
-The Trials Of Arabella.
-Well, there's still time.

224
00:29:06,509 --> 00:29:08,099
-Doesn't have to be this evening.
-No, it's impossible.

225
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,599
Briony.
Tell you what. I'm good at voices,

226
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,519
you're even better,
so we'll read it out after dinner.

227
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:14,519
-Briony, did you read this letter?
-Yes, let's. That's a wonderful idea.

228
00:29:14,609 --> 00:29:19,029
-Briony!
-Here we are. My choc-tail.

229
00:29:19,529 --> 00:29:21,400
I insist you try it.

230
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:24,240
Wasn't there an envelope?

231
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:37,380
Do you mind if I come in?

232
00:29:39,049 --> 00:29:41,420
I've had the most appalling evening.

233
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:45,509
The twins have been torturing me. Look.

234
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:46,930
How awful.

235
00:29:50,059 --> 00:29:51,390
Chinese burns.

236
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,940
That's right.

237
00:29:55,269 --> 00:30:00,109
They want to go home.
They think it's me that's keeping them here.

238
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:07,329
Lola.

239
00:30:08,029 --> 00:30:12,410
Can I tell you something?
Something really terrible.

240
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,789
Yes, please.

241
00:30:14,619 --> 00:30:17,750
What's the worst word
you can possibly imagine?

242
00:30:28,349 --> 00:30:30,599
-He's a sex maniac!
-That's right.

243
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,180
-What's Cecilia going to do?
-I don't know.

244
00:30:32,269 --> 00:30:34,849
-You ought to call the police.
-Do you think so?

245
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:37,650
He said he thought about it all day long.

246
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:39,900
All you have to do is show them the letter.

247
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:42,779
-You won't tell anyone, will you, promise?
-I promise.

248
00:30:42,859 --> 00:30:46,069
Good. If he found out,
there's no knowing what he might do.

249
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,369
You're right.

250
00:30:49,619 --> 00:30:52,910
You better tidy your face.
I've still got to change.

251
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:57,829
Thanks, Briony. You're a real brick.

252
00:33:19,309 --> 00:33:20,440
Cecilia!

253
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:41,119
-It was a mistake.
-Briony read it.

254
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:43,670
My God, I'm so sorry.
It was the wrong version.

255
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:45,039
Yes.

256
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,970
-It was never meant to be read.
-No.

257
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:27,840
What was in the version
I was meant to read?

258
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,880
I don't know. It was more formal. Less...

259
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,590
-Anatomical?
-Yes.

260
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:42,429
It's been there for weeks,
and then this morning by the fountain...

261
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:54,610
I've never done anything like that before.

262
00:34:54,949 --> 00:34:57,909
And I was so angry with you,
and with myself.

263
00:35:00,739 --> 00:35:04,250
I thought if you went away to medical
school, then I'd be happy, but...

264
00:35:04,329 --> 00:35:07,920
I don't know how I could have been
so ignorant about myself, so...

265
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,380
So stupid.

266
00:35:20,099 --> 00:35:22,929
You do know what I'm talking about,
don't you?

267
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:28,440
You knew before I did.

268
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:31,940
Why are you crying?

269
00:35:33,489 --> 00:35:35,110
Don't you know?

270
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:37,360
Yes, I know exactly.

271
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:22,760
Robbie.

272
00:37:23,719 --> 00:37:24,800
Cecilia.

273
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:27,849
I love you.

274
00:37:30,389 --> 00:37:31,769
I love you.

275
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:14,599
Someone's come in.

276
00:38:16,269 --> 00:38:17,519
Cecilia!

277
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:03,530
People were sitting out
having dinner on the pavement.

278
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:08,030
It was always the view of my parents
that hot weather encouraged loose morals.

279
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:10,489
In high summer, my sister and l
were never allowed out of the house.

280
00:39:10,579 --> 00:39:14,289
They thought the villagers would be
unnecessarily provoked.

281
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:20,090
What do you say, Cee? Does the hot weather
make you behave badly?

282
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,840
-Good heavens, you're blushing.
-It's just hot in here, that's all.

283
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:27,510
Lola, wipe that lipstick off.
You're far too young.

284
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:31,309
What about you, Briony?
What sins have you committed today?

285
00:39:32,179 --> 00:39:35,480
-I've done nothing wrong.
Have you seen the twins recently?

286
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:38,269
They didn't look very happy
last time I saw them, poor little chaps.

287
00:39:38,349 --> 00:39:41,730
You know nothing about it.
-Briony. I can't imagine what's got into you.

288
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:44,360
-I've never known you to be so rude.
Well, they're not poor little chaps.

289
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,570
-Just look what they did to Lola.
-What are you talking about?

290
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:49,869
Jackson and Pierrot
bruised her arm. Gave her Chinese burns.

291
00:39:49,949 --> 00:39:51,869
I'm afraid she's quite right.
I had to pull them off her.

292
00:39:51,949 --> 00:39:54,289
How I got my war wound.

293
00:39:54,369 --> 00:39:55,789
The twins did that, Lola?

294
00:39:55,869 --> 00:39:57,750
Yes, it all turned
into a bit of a wrestle,

295
00:39:57,829 --> 00:40:00,170
I'm afraid. Still, no harm done, eh, Lola?

296
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:01,920
Would you go and find these boys,
please, Briony?

297
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,710
Tell them dinner's ready,
and where are their manners?

298
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,719
-Why do I have to go?
-Briony, you'll do as you're told,

299
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,300
or you'll go straight to your room.

300
00:40:37,409 --> 00:40:38,920
It's a letter!
-Give it to me!

301
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,579
They've run away.
Who has?

302
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:42,000
The twins.

303
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:47,920
"We are going to run away because Lola
is so horrid to us and we want to go home.

304
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:51,139
-"Also, there wasn't a play."
-Don't worry.

305
00:40:51,219 --> 00:40:53,469
We'll send out some search parties.
They can't have gone far.

306
00:40:53,559 --> 00:40:55,599
Cee, you come with me.

307
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,480
Pierrot!

308
00:41:03,309 --> 00:41:04,400
Jackson!

309
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:06,730
Boys!

310
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:09,030
Jackson!

311
00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:12,320
Pierrot!

312
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:54,429
Lola? Are you all right?

313
00:42:55,010 --> 00:42:57,849
I'm sorry. I didn't... I'm sorry.

314
00:42:57,929 --> 00:43:00,010
Who was it?

315
00:43:02,269 --> 00:43:03,599
I saw him.

316
00:43:04,639 --> 00:43:05,730
I saw him.

317
00:43:06,769 --> 00:43:09,019
-It was him, wasn't it?
-Yes, it was him.

318
00:43:09,110 --> 00:43:10,690
Lola, who was it?

319
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:16,280
It was Robbie, wasn't it? Robbie?

320
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:20,739
-You saw him?
-Like you said, he's a sex maniac.

321
00:43:20,829 --> 00:43:23,579
And you don't even know
what happened before dinner.

322
00:43:23,659 --> 00:43:25,250
I caught him attacking my sister
in the library.

323
00:43:25,329 --> 00:43:27,539
I don't know what he'd have done
if I hadn't come in.

324
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:31,090
-You actually saw him?
-Of course I did. Plain as day.

325
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:37,219
He pushed me to the ground.
And then he put his hands over my eyes.

326
00:43:38,389 --> 00:43:43,469
-I couldn't actually... I never actually...
-Listen. I've known him

327
00:43:43,559 --> 00:43:45,769
my whole life, and I saw him.

328
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:48,940
Because I couldn't say for sure.

329
00:43:49,769 --> 00:43:52,480
Well, I can. And I will.

330
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:00,869
Call the police.
And she'll be needing a doctor, as well.

331
00:44:11,789 --> 00:44:16,090
-It's all right, dear. It's all right now.
Is Robbie back yet?

332
00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:18,380
I haven't seen him.

333
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,639
I know who it was.

334
00:44:23,099 --> 00:44:26,559
-You saw him, then?
-Yes, I saw him.

335
00:44:26,639 --> 00:44:29,690
-Just as you see me?
-I know it was him.

336
00:44:29,769 --> 00:44:33,150
You know it was him? Or you saw him?

337
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:37,989
-Yes, I did, I saw him.
-With your own eyes?

338
00:44:38,989 --> 00:44:42,780
Yes. I saw him, I saw him with my own eyes.

339
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:48,329
Well done, darling.

340
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:43,429
My brother and I found the two of them
down by the lake.

341
00:45:43,510 --> 00:45:45,639
You didn't see anyone else?

342
00:45:47,849 --> 00:45:52,559
I wouldn't necessarily believe everything
Briony tells you. She's rather fanciful.

343
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:03,909
When they went looking,
I went up to my dad's.

344
00:46:03,989 --> 00:46:06,619
-I did, honest.
Why was that?

345
00:46:07,909 --> 00:46:09,659
To tell him all about it.

346
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:15,250
-I know I shouldn't have opened it.
No, you should not.

347
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:19,710
But at least you've done the right thing now.

348
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,010
Sir, there is someone coming.

349
00:47:30,239 --> 00:47:32,079
-Time you went to bed.
-But...

350
00:47:32,159 --> 00:47:33,289
Now.

351
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:47,360
Cecilia!

352
00:49:10,639 --> 00:49:15,269
You liars! You liars! Liars! Liars!

353
00:49:55,179 --> 00:49:57,349
Northern France
Four years later

354
00:50:02,849 --> 00:50:06,360
I says to him, I says, "You can sit
down there, twiddling your thumbs,

355
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:08,530
"waiting to get your head blown off,
if you want to.

356
00:50:08,610 --> 00:50:09,780
"I'm off out of it."

357
00:50:19,449 --> 00:50:23,420
Bonsoir monsieur. Bonsoir?
Let me do this.

358
00:50:38,639 --> 00:50:40,059
What's his game?

359
00:50:40,139 --> 00:50:42,440
-He says he's got something for us.
-Fucking hell!

360
00:50:43,769 --> 00:50:45,980
Wait! We have food for you

361
00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:47,230
Bread, sugar

362
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:48,400
And wine!

363
00:50:58,789 --> 00:51:00,449
What are you doing here?

364
00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:10,260
When the retreat started, Panzers attacked,

365
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:13,420
and I was separated from my unit

366
00:51:13,590 --> 00:51:16,090
So it's true, the English are retreating

367
00:51:18,929 --> 00:51:21,599
We'll be gone at first light

368
00:51:23,139 --> 00:51:26,019
We fought all those years,
lost all those dead,

369
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,980
now the Germans are in France again

370
00:51:32,530 --> 00:51:33,949
We will come back

371
00:51:36,110 --> 00:51:37,780
we will throw them out

372
00:51:39,619 --> 00:51:42,409
I promise you

373
00:51:43,789 --> 00:51:45,460
Good luck

374
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:51,840
Come on, then.

375
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:55,929
How come a toff like you, talks French
and everything, ends up a private?

376
00:51:56,010 --> 00:51:59,639
Not eligible for officers' training
if you join direct from prison.

377
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:03,059
-You're pulling my tit.
-No, I'm not.

378
00:52:04,639 --> 00:52:08,099
They gave me a choice.
Stay in prison or join the Army.

379
00:52:09,150 --> 00:52:12,320
And for the record,
the last thing I am is a toff.

380
00:52:31,289 --> 00:52:33,340
Six months earlier

381
00:53:00,530 --> 00:53:02,030
I'm sorry I'm late, I got lost.

382
00:53:02,159 --> 00:53:03,909
-Hello.
-Hello.

383
00:53:13,670 --> 00:53:16,210
-Should we sit down?
-Yes, of course.

384
00:53:31,309 --> 00:53:34,480
-I'm sorry, I can't remember, l...
-Two. Thank you.

385
00:54:09,059 --> 00:54:10,940
Where are you living?

386
00:54:12,599 --> 00:54:14,940
Tiny flat in Balham. It's ghastly.

387
00:54:15,019 --> 00:54:18,320
-The landlady's rude and horribly nosy.
-You look the same.

388
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:20,900
-Apart from the uniform, of course.
-Yes, I'm sorry. I've got to go back

389
00:54:20,989 --> 00:54:24,119
-to the hospital in half an hour.
-Oh, God, that...

390
00:54:45,469 --> 00:54:46,889
-Sorry.
-No.

391
00:54:51,019 --> 00:54:53,599
Have you been in touch with your family?

392
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:55,730
No, I told you I wouldn't.

393
00:54:57,230 --> 00:54:59,610
Leon waited outside the hospital last week,
I just pushed past him.

394
00:54:59,690 --> 00:55:02,449
Cee, you don't owe me anything.

395
00:55:04,570 --> 00:55:07,199
Robbie, didn't you read my letters?

396
00:55:07,619 --> 00:55:09,829
Had I been allowed to visit you,
had they let me every day,

397
00:55:09,909 --> 00:55:12,409
-I would have been there every day.
-Yes, but...

398
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:16,079
If all we have rests on a few moments

399
00:55:16,170 --> 00:55:18,750
in a library three and a half years ago,
then I'm not sure,

400
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:21,969
-I don't know if...
-Robbie, look at me.

401
00:55:25,130 --> 00:55:27,760
Look at me.

402
00:55:28,849 --> 00:55:30,219
Come back.

403
00:55:33,429 --> 00:55:35,150
Come back to me.

404
00:55:49,409 --> 00:55:51,159
Dearest Cecilia.

405
00:55:52,869 --> 00:55:55,000
Dearest Cecilia.

406
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:03,380
Cecilia.

407
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:20,980
A friend of mine has a cottage by the coast.

408
00:56:21,070 --> 00:56:23,400
Said we can borrow it
when you're next on leave.

409
00:56:23,489 --> 00:56:26,610
White clapboard
with blue-painted window frames.

410
00:56:28,409 --> 00:56:31,780
-I hope this bus never comes.
-Here.

411
00:56:33,949 --> 00:56:36,789
Something to think of while you're away.

412
00:56:59,230 --> 00:57:00,360
I love you.

413
00:58:31,110 --> 00:58:33,280
Some poor sod's gonna catch a packet.

414
00:58:41,829 --> 00:58:46,090
My darling. Briony found
my address somehow, and sent a letter.

415
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:50,050
The first surprise was
she didn't go up to Cambridge.

416
00:58:50,130 --> 00:58:52,929
She's doing nurse's training
at my old hospital.

417
00:58:54,139 --> 00:58:56,929
I think she may be doing this
as some kind of penance.

418
00:58:57,010 --> 00:59:01,730
She says she's beginning to get the full
grasp of what she did, and what it meant.

419
00:59:01,849 --> 00:59:04,349
She wants to come and talk to me.

420
00:59:05,690 --> 00:59:10,440
I love you. I'll wait for you. Come back.

421
00:59:11,860 --> 00:59:12,949
Come back to me.

422
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:16,699
Come back. Come back to me.

423
00:59:17,739 --> 00:59:20,909
Come back. Come back to me.

424
00:59:24,329 --> 00:59:26,329
So where we going, guv?

425
00:59:41,059 --> 00:59:43,309
Fucking hate those boots!

426
00:59:43,389 --> 00:59:46,190
I hate them worse
than all the fucking Germans put together!

427
00:59:46,269 --> 00:59:49,440
You'll have a job getting back to England
in your socks.

428
01:01:27,210 --> 01:01:29,960
Come on, pal,
you should be getting dressed.

429
01:01:30,039 --> 01:01:33,210
-If I fell in, would you save me?
-Of course.

430
01:01:45,889 --> 01:01:46,929
Briony!

431
01:02:12,210 --> 01:02:13,380
Thank you.

432
01:02:21,679 --> 01:02:23,139
Thank you! Thank you, thank you!

433
01:02:23,219 --> 01:02:25,969
That's an incredibly bloody
stupid thing to do.

434
01:02:26,099 --> 01:02:27,469
I wanted you to save me.
-Don't you know

435
01:02:27,559 --> 01:02:29,230
how easily you could have drowned?

436
01:02:29,559 --> 01:02:32,400
-You saved me.
-Stupid child!

437
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:36,320
You could have killed us both.
Is that your idea of a joke?

438
01:02:38,070 --> 01:02:40,780
I want to thank you for saving my life.

439
01:02:41,949 --> 01:02:44,570
I will be eternally grateful to you.

440
01:02:57,090 --> 01:02:58,960
The story can resume.

441
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:03,800
Our story can resume. I will simply resume.

442
01:03:04,429 --> 01:03:06,889
Jerry, come and have a go at us
in fucking South End.

443
01:03:06,969 --> 01:03:11,980
Or better still, Trafalgar Square.
No one speaks the fucking lingo out here.

444
01:03:12,059 --> 01:03:14,980
You can't say, "Pass the biscuit," or
"Where's me hand grenade?"

445
01:03:15,059 --> 01:03:18,610
They just shrug. Because they hate us, too.
I mean, that's the point.

446
01:03:18,690 --> 01:03:22,110
We fight in France
and the French fucking hate us.

447
01:03:22,199 --> 01:03:25,369
Make me Home Secretary,
I'll sort this out in a fucking minute.

448
01:03:25,449 --> 01:03:27,949
We got India and Africa, right?

449
01:03:28,030 --> 01:03:31,409
Jerry can have France and Belgium
and wherever else they want.

450
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:35,380
Who's fucking ever been to Poland?
It's all about room, empire.

451
01:03:35,460 --> 01:03:38,550
They want more empire,
give 'em this shithole, we keep ours,

452
01:03:38,630 --> 01:03:41,760
and it's "Bob's your uncle"
and "Fanny's your fucking aunt"!

453
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:43,420
Think about it.

454
01:03:53,309 --> 01:03:56,650
Dearest Cecilia.
The story can resume.

455
01:03:58,980 --> 01:04:02,239
The one I had been planning
on that evening walk.

456
01:04:03,650 --> 01:04:06,530
I can become again the man
who once crossed the Surrey park

457
01:04:06,610 --> 01:04:11,159
at dusk in my best suit,
swaggering on the promise of life.

458
01:04:11,239 --> 01:04:15,869
The man who, with the clarity of passion,
made love to you in the library.

459
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:22,340
The story can resume.

460
01:04:26,429 --> 01:04:29,099
I will return,

461
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:32,019
find you, love you,

462
01:04:32,099 --> 01:04:35,599
marry you. And live without shame.

463
01:04:53,239 --> 01:04:54,909
You can smell the sea.

464
01:05:27,239 --> 01:05:28,280
Fuck me.

465
01:05:29,610 --> 01:05:34,489
-It's like something out of the Bible.
Jesus Christ.

466
01:05:36,659 --> 01:05:38,869
Come on, get everybody
to clean this mess up now.

467
01:05:39,250 --> 01:05:41,880
We've just arrived, sir. Can you
tell us what we're supposed to be doing?

468
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:44,250
Nothing. Just wait.
Where are the ships?

469
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:47,010
A few made it in yesterday,
Luftwaffe blew them to buggery.

470
01:05:47,090 --> 01:05:49,880
Lost 3,000 men
when they sank the Lancastria.

471
01:05:49,969 --> 01:05:53,429
High command, in its infinite wisdom,
is denying us air cover.

472
01:05:53,510 --> 01:05:55,389
A disgrace, a fucking disaster.

473
01:05:55,469 --> 01:05:58,139
No, look, the thing is, you see,
I'm expected back, you see.

474
01:05:58,230 --> 01:06:01,980
There's over 300,000 men on this beach,
Private. You'll have to wait your turn.

475
01:06:02,059 --> 01:06:06,440
Just be grateful you're not wounded.
I've orders to leave the wounded behind.

476
01:06:06,989 --> 01:06:11,909
No, no, no, leave it, guv! Never trust a sailor
on dry land. You're best off out of it.

477
01:06:26,380 --> 01:06:27,710
That's not right.

478
01:06:52,409 --> 01:06:53,489
Christ.

479
01:07:00,869 --> 01:07:02,750
Can you hear me, laddies?

480
01:07:02,829 --> 01:07:05,170
I'm coming home!

481
01:08:03,849 --> 01:08:08,440
Take from our souls
the strain and stress

482
01:08:08,519 --> 01:08:12,860
And let our ordered lives confess

483
01:08:12,940 --> 01:08:17,119
The beauty of Thy peace

484
01:08:17,199 --> 01:08:22,119
The beauty of Thy peace

485
01:08:22,579 --> 01:08:27,210
Breathe through the heats of our desire

486
01:08:27,289 --> 01:08:31,590
Thy coolness and Thy balm

487
01:08:31,750 --> 01:08:36,090
Let sense be numb, let flesh retire

488
01:08:36,180 --> 01:08:40,510
Speak through the earthquake, wind and fire

489
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:44,850
O still, small voice of calm

490
01:09:15,510 --> 01:09:16,590
Guv'nor.

491
01:09:20,430 --> 01:09:22,850
I have to get something to drink.

492
01:09:22,930 --> 01:09:25,479
You need one. You're grey.

493
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:28,390
He's gone all grey, can you see?

494
01:09:44,409 --> 01:09:46,159
There. Come on.

495
01:09:48,369 --> 01:09:50,039
All I want's a cup of tea now.

496
01:10:07,350 --> 01:10:09,810
What the fuck you doing?

497
01:10:34,590 --> 01:10:40,470
I'm coming home!
Laddie, I'm coming home!

498
01:10:43,390 --> 01:10:49,810
Fuck 'em all! Fuck 'em all!
The long and the short and the tall

499
01:10:49,890 --> 01:10:54,729
Fuck all the Sergeants and WO1s
Fuck all the corporals

500
01:10:54,810 --> 01:10:56,359
and their bastard sons

501
01:10:56,439 --> 01:11:02,739
'Cause we're saying goodbye to them all
As back to their billets they crawl

502
01:11:02,859 --> 01:11:06,239
You'll get no promotion
this side of the ocean

503
01:11:06,329 --> 01:11:10,079
So cheer up, my lads
Fuck 'em all!

504
01:12:20,189 --> 01:12:21,689
Mike!

505
01:12:28,449 --> 01:12:29,909
Mike!

506
01:12:32,369 --> 01:12:33,619
Hold up, guv.

507
01:12:42,210 --> 01:12:43,340
Wait here.

508
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:25,380
Why don't you sit down?

509
01:13:34,100 --> 01:13:36,020
It's so hot in here.

510
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:38,479
Take off your boots.

511
01:13:57,789 --> 01:14:01,500
I have to get back. I promised her.

512
01:14:01,579 --> 01:14:03,800
To put things right.

513
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:08,130
And she loves me. She's waiting for me.

514
01:14:12,350 --> 01:14:13,390
Oi!

515
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:17,890
Wait, wait, wait.

516
01:14:19,060 --> 01:14:22,149
Hey, what have you done with your boots?

517
01:14:24,770 --> 01:14:27,399
-Look, you're sure you're feeling all right?
-Never better.

518
01:14:27,489 --> 01:14:31,529
Now I'm wondering whether the beach
really is the best place for dinner.

519
01:14:33,199 --> 01:14:38,250
-I'm not sure, I don't recognise it.
-Dunno.

520
01:14:38,329 --> 01:14:40,539
-This'll do, down here.
-No.

521
01:14:41,670 --> 01:14:44,250
-No, no, it's further on.
-What is?

522
01:14:44,340 --> 01:14:46,550
This place I know, an old cottage
with white clapboards

523
01:14:46,630 --> 01:14:49,220
and blue-painted window frames.

524
01:14:51,090 --> 01:14:55,140
Aw, yes.
That's right, that's where we're going.

525
01:14:55,220 --> 01:14:59,390
-It's close to here.
-We're there. This is it.

526
01:15:22,039 --> 01:15:24,630
Here we are, guv. Down here.

527
01:16:01,369 --> 01:16:04,079
That's all right, guv. That's right.

528
01:16:06,130 --> 01:16:10,670
Get your head down. Get your head down.
There you go.

529
01:16:26,149 --> 01:16:29,109
Tuck yourself in. Keep yourself warm.

530
01:16:36,239 --> 01:16:40,989
Chew on a bit of this. But quiet like,
or they'll all be wanting some.

531
01:16:44,619 --> 01:16:46,710
Try and get some sleep.

532
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:19,800
Find you.

533
01:18:21,140 --> 01:18:22,390
Love you.

534
01:18:23,180 --> 01:18:24,680
Marry you.

535
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:27,390
And live without shame.

536
01:18:57,960 --> 01:19:03,850
I love you. Come back. Come back to me.

537
01:19:10,020 --> 01:19:12,189
Bit too much noise, guv'nor.
-What?

538
01:19:14,359 --> 01:19:16,819
-What noise?
-You keep shouting.

539
01:19:16,899 --> 01:19:19,819
-Some of the lads are getting a bit peeved.
-What?

540
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:36,630
-Christ. You look a bit rough.
-Thing is, I've decided to stay on for a bit.

541
01:19:37,750 --> 01:19:41,050
I'm meeting someone,
and I'm always keeping her waiting.

542
01:19:41,130 --> 01:19:44,720
Now, listen. Listen to me, guv'nor.

543
01:19:45,350 --> 01:19:49,600
I went out for a Jimmy Riddle just now.
Guess what I saw!

544
01:19:50,180 --> 01:19:53,390
They're getting themselves sorted out
down on the beach.

545
01:19:53,689 --> 01:19:58,479
The boats are back, and a geezer from
the Buffs is marching us down at 7:00.

546
01:19:59,439 --> 01:20:02,779
We're away. We're off home, mate.

547
01:20:05,279 --> 01:20:09,079
So get some more sleep, and no more
of your bleeding shouting.

548
01:20:09,159 --> 01:20:13,369
-All right?
-I won't say a word.

549
01:20:16,210 --> 01:20:19,050
Wake me before 7:00, would you?
Thanks so much.

550
01:20:21,420 --> 01:20:26,430
You won't hear another word
from me. Promise.

551
01:20:31,140 --> 01:20:34,770
London
Three weeks earlier

552
01:21:16,270 --> 01:21:18,899
Bed castors should be lined up
and pointing inwards.

553
01:21:18,979 --> 01:21:22,189
I found three yesterday that weren't.
You know who you are.

554
01:21:22,279 --> 01:21:24,609
Which of you were responsible
for putting away the blankets today?

555
01:21:24,689 --> 01:21:26,739
I was, Sister.
-I don't suppose you can tell us

556
01:21:26,819 --> 01:21:28,279
-what you did wrong?
-No, Sister.

557
01:21:28,359 --> 01:21:30,159
Labels are folded to the inside,
are they not?

558
01:21:30,239 --> 01:21:31,659
-Yes, Sister.
-Do them again.

559
01:21:31,739 --> 01:21:36,079
Nurse Tallis, I'll see you in my office.
The rest of you are excused.

560
01:21:49,010 --> 01:21:52,180
-ls this job at all important to you, Tallis?
-Very important, Sister.

561
01:21:52,260 --> 01:21:54,470
Yesterday, you were seconded
to men's surgical.

562
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:57,560
When your patient came round from his
anaesthetic, it seems the first thing he did

563
01:21:57,640 --> 01:22:00,100
was to ask for Briony.
Who might Briony be?

564
01:22:00,189 --> 01:22:03,359
-Well, me, Sister.
-There is no Briony.

565
01:22:03,439 --> 01:22:06,899
You are Tallis. Nurse Tallis.
Is that understood?

566
01:22:06,989 --> 01:22:08,149
Yes, Sister.

567
01:22:18,289 --> 01:22:19,789
There is no Briony.

568
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:27,590
This is the BBC
Home Service. Here is the news.

569
01:22:27,670 --> 01:22:31,140
The BEF, with their French allies,
are fighting a desperate battle

570
01:22:31,220 --> 01:22:33,560
in the northern zone of the Western Front.

571
01:22:33,640 --> 01:22:38,060
The Allied Forces have not lost
cohesion, and their morale is high.

572
01:22:38,140 --> 01:22:41,020
The RAF continues to give all the support
in its power

573
01:22:41,100 --> 01:22:44,359
to the Allied armies in northeastern
France and Belgium. Railways, roads,

574
01:22:44,439 --> 01:22:48,279
bridges and enemy troops have been
continuously attacked, yesterday...

575
01:23:05,590 --> 01:23:08,880
Thanks. I never could make the scissors
work with my left hand.

576
01:23:08,970 --> 01:23:11,090
Mummy always did it for me.

577
01:23:12,470 --> 01:23:14,260
There, you're done.

578
01:23:18,770 --> 01:23:19,850
Bother!

579
01:23:26,319 --> 01:23:27,359
Night-night, Ponty.

580
01:23:28,779 --> 01:23:30,569
Good night, Tallis.

581
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:48,210
Don't panic! It's only me.

582
01:23:48,300 --> 01:23:52,010
Fiona, I almost jumped out of my skin.

583
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:55,800
So this is where you duck to after lights out.

584
01:23:55,890 --> 01:24:00,100
I thought you might be in the middle
of some tempestuous romance.

585
01:24:00,479 --> 01:24:03,189
Don't you freeze to death up here?

586
01:24:05,609 --> 01:24:07,229
I love London.

587
01:24:08,939 --> 01:24:11,319
Do you think all of this will be
bombed and just disappear?

588
01:24:11,399 --> 01:24:12,489
No.

589
01:24:14,109 --> 01:24:15,699
I don't know.

590
01:24:16,619 --> 01:24:18,909
Do you write about Sister Drummond?

591
01:24:19,789 --> 01:24:22,119
-Do you write about me?
-Sometimes.

592
01:24:23,329 --> 01:24:26,840
-Can I look?
-I'd rather you didn't. It's private.

593
01:24:27,670 --> 01:24:31,300
I don't see any point in writing a story
if you're not going to let anyone read it.

594
01:24:31,380 --> 01:24:33,840
-It's not ready yet. It's unfinished.
-What's it about?

595
01:24:40,470 --> 01:24:43,479
-It's complicated.
-Yes?

596
01:24:43,560 --> 01:24:44,770
It's just...

597
01:24:47,229 --> 01:24:52,189
It's about a young girl, a young and
foolish girl, who sees something from

598
01:24:52,279 --> 01:24:56,819
her bedroom window which she doesn't
understand, but she thinks she does.

599
01:25:00,449 --> 01:25:02,619
I probably won't ever finish it.

600
01:25:03,250 --> 01:25:06,420
I look at you, Tallis,
and you're so mysterious.

601
01:25:07,079 --> 01:25:09,500
I've never been mysterious.

602
01:25:11,210 --> 01:25:14,010
-Do you know what I decided tonight?
-What?

603
01:25:16,470 --> 01:25:20,050
I could never marry a man
who wasn't in the Royal Navy.

604
01:25:29,729 --> 01:25:32,529
Here we are. Cecilia Tallis.

605
01:25:33,029 --> 01:25:35,199
I think this is her address.

606
01:25:37,239 --> 01:25:38,409
Thank you.

607
01:25:47,420 --> 01:25:51,170
Dear Cecilia. Please don't
throw this away without reading it.

608
01:25:52,300 --> 01:25:54,800
As you'll have seen from the
notepaper, I'm here at St Thomas'

609
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:57,130
doing my nurses' training.

610
01:25:57,220 --> 01:25:59,720
I decided not to take up
my place at Cambridge.

611
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:01,180
Oh, God.

612
01:26:02,850 --> 01:26:06,640
I decided I wanted to make myself useful.
Do something practical.

613
01:26:09,399 --> 01:26:12,439
It says in the newspaper
the Army are making strategic withdrawals.

614
01:26:12,520 --> 01:26:13,609
Yes, I saw that.

615
01:26:13,689 --> 01:26:15,739
It's a euphemism for retreat.

616
01:26:17,069 --> 01:26:20,779
No matter how hard I work,
no matter how long the hours,

617
01:26:21,699 --> 01:26:24,159
I can't escape from what I did

618
01:26:24,239 --> 01:26:27,289
and what it meant,

619
01:26:27,369 --> 01:26:31,079
the full extent of which
I am only now beginning to grasp.

620
01:26:38,050 --> 01:26:41,010
Cee, please write and tell me we can meet.

621
01:26:42,760 --> 01:26:44,600
Your sister, Briony.

622
01:26:46,930 --> 01:26:49,810
So do you?
-Do I what?

623
01:26:50,229 --> 01:26:54,520
Have a secret fiancé in France.
That's what everyone thinks.

624
01:26:54,609 --> 01:26:55,649
No, of course not.

625
01:26:55,729 --> 01:26:58,319
Imagine not knowing if he'd ever come back.

626
01:26:58,399 --> 01:27:00,569
I've never been in love.

627
01:27:01,319 --> 01:27:04,029
What, never? Not even a crush?

628
01:27:04,699 --> 01:27:08,159
Oh, I had a crush once, when I was 10 or 11.

629
01:27:10,369 --> 01:27:13,710
I jumped into a river to see
if he'd save me from drowning.

630
01:27:13,789 --> 01:27:17,300
-Now you're teasing me.
-Oh, no. And he did save me.

631
01:27:20,300 --> 01:27:23,970
But as soon as I told him I loved him,
the feeling sort of disappeared.

632
01:27:24,050 --> 01:27:25,640
Something's happened.

633
01:27:30,100 --> 01:27:31,600
Outside, quickly.

634
01:28:15,770 --> 01:28:17,020
Robbie.

635
01:28:21,069 --> 01:28:22,149
Excuse me.

636
01:29:11,829 --> 01:29:15,289
Nurse Tallis, you speak a little French,
if I remember rightly.

637
01:29:15,369 --> 01:29:16,619
Only school French, Sister.

638
01:29:16,710 --> 01:29:21,050
There's a soldier in Bed 13. Go and sit
with him for a minute. Hold his hand.

639
01:29:21,130 --> 01:29:22,260
Off you go.

640
01:30:16,229 --> 01:30:17,729
Here you are at last

641
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:20,229
Sister sent me

642
01:30:20,310 --> 01:30:22,569
for a little chat

643
01:30:25,399 --> 01:30:27,649
I remember your sister

644
01:30:28,149 --> 01:30:30,699
she was always so nice

645
01:30:32,409 --> 01:30:33,989
what's she doing now?

646
01:30:35,869 --> 01:30:39,210
She is a nurse as well

647
01:30:40,250 --> 01:30:43,380
Did she finally marry that man
she was so in love with?

648
01:30:44,050 --> 01:30:45,460
I've forgotten his name

649
01:30:45,550 --> 01:30:46,630
Robbie?

650
01:30:48,380 --> 01:30:49,880
She will soon I hope

651
01:30:50,840 --> 01:30:51,930
Robbie

652
01:30:52,550 --> 01:30:54,390
yes that's right

653
01:30:56,680 --> 01:30:57,770
And you?

654
01:30:58,100 --> 01:30:59,640
What is your name?

655
01:31:01,859 --> 01:31:02,899
Luc.

656
01:31:04,399 --> 01:31:05,819
Luc Cornet.

657
01:31:08,029 --> 01:31:09,279
And you?

658
01:31:09,359 --> 01:31:10,449
Tallis.

659
01:31:11,869 --> 01:31:12,909
Tallis.

660
01:31:14,739 --> 01:31:16,659
That's pretty

661
01:31:21,579 --> 01:31:24,210
I remember you now

662
01:31:26,170 --> 01:31:28,300
the English girl

663
01:31:29,510 --> 01:31:32,300
You remember your first visit to Millau?

664
01:31:33,640 --> 01:31:36,180
I was working by the ovens with my father.

665
01:31:37,180 --> 01:31:39,350
I heard your accent

666
01:31:43,479 --> 01:31:46,229
Can you do me a little favour Tallis?

667
01:31:48,149 --> 01:31:50,819
These bandages are so tight,

668
01:31:51,149 --> 01:31:54,279
can you loosen them a bit, please?

669
01:31:55,409 --> 01:31:56,829
Of course

670
01:32:04,710 --> 01:32:07,050
You remember my younger sister, Anne?

671
01:32:09,460 --> 01:32:12,510
She still plays that little Debussy piece

672
01:32:14,260 --> 01:32:15,680
do you remember?

673
01:32:18,060 --> 01:32:21,140
She looks so serious when she plays

674
01:32:22,270 --> 01:32:24,149
And our croissants,

675
01:32:24,770 --> 01:32:26,609
what did you think of them?

676
01:32:34,239 --> 01:32:36,409
The most delicious in Millau

677
01:32:36,829 --> 01:32:37,869
Yes.

678
01:32:38,079 --> 01:32:40,199
it's the quality of the butter

679
01:32:41,909 --> 01:32:42,960
Yes

680
01:32:46,460 --> 01:32:48,920
Is that why you came every day?

681
01:32:50,380 --> 01:32:51,970
Because you know,

682
01:32:53,930 --> 01:32:57,390
my mother is very fond of you

683
01:32:58,100 --> 01:32:59,810
in her opinion,

684
01:33:00,310 --> 01:33:03,060
we should get married in the summer

685
01:33:03,430 --> 01:33:04,890
Oh yes?

686
01:33:05,149 --> 01:33:06,649
Yes

687
01:33:14,609 --> 01:33:16,989
I hope that's more comfortable

688
01:33:21,909 --> 01:33:22,949
Do you love me?

689
01:33:23,039 --> 01:33:25,039
Yes

690
01:33:33,420 --> 01:33:35,880
Can you stay a while?

691
01:33:37,390 --> 01:33:40,430
I'm frightened

692
01:33:49,770 --> 01:33:51,399
-Tallis.
-Briony.

693
01:33:53,149 --> 01:33:54,939
Je m'appelle Briony.

694
01:34:06,789 --> 01:34:08,880
Stand up, Nurse Tallis.

695
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:16,590
Now go and wash the blood off your face.

696
01:35:18,439 --> 01:35:23,409
The Navy has earned our
undying gratitude. The Army is undefeated.

697
01:35:23,489 --> 01:35:27,250
Courage has brought them through
unconquered, their spirit unbowed.

698
01:35:27,329 --> 01:35:29,409
This is the epic of Dunkirk.

699
01:35:29,500 --> 01:35:33,750
A name that will live forever
in the annals of warfare.

700
01:35:37,510 --> 01:35:39,720
In the course of a comprehensive tour,

701
01:35:39,800 --> 01:35:43,550
Queen Elizabeth is seen here visiting
a chocolate factory in the north of England.

702
01:35:43,640 --> 01:35:45,970
The confectionary magnate
and friend of the British Army,

703
01:35:46,060 --> 01:35:50,310
Mr Paul Marshall, gave the Queen a tour
of the Army Amo factory

704
01:35:50,390 --> 01:35:54,770
with his lovely,
soon-to-be-wed fiancée, Miss Lola Quincey.

705
01:35:54,859 --> 01:35:57,609
What a mouthwatering couple they are.

706
01:35:57,729 --> 01:36:01,279
Keep the Amo coming.
Our boys have a sweet tooth.

707
01:36:28,890 --> 01:36:34,850
Secondly, for a remedy against sin,
and to avoid fornication,

708
01:36:34,939 --> 01:36:38,819
that such persons
as have not the gift of continence,

709
01:36:38,899 --> 01:36:44,489
might marry and keep themselves
undefiled members of Christ's body.

710
01:36:45,319 --> 01:36:50,539
Thirdly, it was ordained,
for the mutual society, help and comfort,

711
01:36:50,619 --> 01:36:54,170
that the one ought to have the other.

712
01:36:54,250 --> 01:36:55,380
I saw him.

713
01:36:55,460 --> 01:36:59,380
Therefore, if any man can show
any just cause

714
01:36:59,460 --> 01:37:02,420
why they may not be
lawfully joined together...

715
01:37:02,590 --> 01:37:03,630
I know it was him.

716
01:37:03,880 --> 01:37:09,350
...Iet him now speak
or forever hold his peace.

717
01:37:15,939 --> 01:37:18,649
I saw him. I saw him with my own eyes.

718
01:38:01,069 --> 01:38:02,779
Let the nursey through.

719
01:38:02,859 --> 01:38:05,359
They're going down to the country today.
Never been out of London before.

720
01:38:05,449 --> 01:38:06,649
I hope they get a nice family.

721
01:38:06,739 --> 01:38:08,989
They don't know what they're in for
with this lot.

722
01:38:09,069 --> 01:38:10,159
Come on.

723
01:38:28,260 --> 01:38:31,350
I'm looking for Miss Tallis. Cecilia Tallis.

724
01:38:32,760 --> 01:38:33,850
Is she in?

725
01:38:39,979 --> 01:38:42,479
Tallis! Door!

726
01:38:50,279 --> 01:38:52,529
I tried writing. You wouldn't answer.

727
01:38:57,539 --> 01:38:59,420
I have to talk to you.

728
01:39:24,069 --> 01:39:26,439
-So you're a ward sister now?
-Yes.

729
01:39:39,829 --> 01:39:40,920
Thanks.

730
01:39:50,300 --> 01:39:52,340
I want to go in front of a judge
and change my evidence, Cee.

731
01:39:52,430 --> 01:39:54,140
Don't call me that.

732
01:39:59,770 --> 01:40:01,770
Please don't call me that.

733
01:40:04,729 --> 01:40:07,109
I know what I did was terrible.
I don't expect you to forgive me.

734
01:40:07,189 --> 01:40:09,239
Oh, don't worry, I won't.

735
01:40:11,359 --> 01:40:13,909
You're an unreliable witness.
They'll never reopen the case.

736
01:40:13,989 --> 01:40:15,739
Well, at least
I could tell everyone else what I did.

737
01:40:15,829 --> 01:40:18,239
I can go home and explain
to Mummy and Daddy and Leon...

738
01:40:18,329 --> 01:40:20,579
-So what's stopping you?
-Well, I wanted to see you first.

739
01:40:20,659 --> 01:40:22,869
They don't want to hear any more about it.

740
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:26,170
That unpleasantness is all tidied away
in the past, thank you very much.

741
01:40:26,250 --> 01:40:27,380
But...

742
01:40:35,390 --> 01:40:37,640
I'll be late. Better get moving.

743
01:40:41,180 --> 01:40:42,520
Excuse me.

744
01:40:48,899 --> 01:40:50,779
He sleeps so deeply.

745
01:41:51,050 --> 01:41:54,380
-What is she doing here?
-She wanted to speak to me.

746
01:41:54,470 --> 01:41:56,340
Oh, yes, what about?

747
01:41:56,430 --> 01:41:57,800
The terrible thing I did.

748
01:41:57,890 --> 01:41:59,390
Robbie. Darling.

749
01:42:03,390 --> 01:42:05,390
I'll be quite honest with you.

750
01:42:05,479 --> 01:42:06,939
I'm torn between breaking your neck here

751
01:42:07,020 --> 01:42:10,020
and taking you
and throwing you down the stairs.

752
01:42:10,109 --> 01:42:11,229
Oh, God.

753
01:42:11,319 --> 01:42:15,399
Do you have any idea what it's like in jail?
Of course, you don't.

754
01:42:15,779 --> 01:42:18,359
Tell me, did it give you pleasure
to think of me inside?

755
01:42:18,449 --> 01:42:20,279
-No.
-But you did nothing about it.

756
01:42:20,369 --> 01:42:22,079
-No.
-Do you think I assaulted your cousin?

757
01:42:22,159 --> 01:42:23,239
-No.
-Did you think it then?

758
01:42:23,329 --> 01:42:24,409
Yes. But yes and no.

759
01:42:24,500 --> 01:42:26,409
-And what's made you so certain now?
-Growing up.

760
01:42:26,500 --> 01:42:28,039
-Growing up?
-I was 13.

761
01:42:28,119 --> 01:42:31,289
How old do you have to be to know
the difference between right and wrong?

762
01:42:31,380 --> 01:42:32,800
What are you, 18?

763
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:35,760
Do you have to be 18 before
you can bring yourself to own up to a lie?

764
01:42:35,840 --> 01:42:39,930
There are soldiers of 18, old enough
to be left to die by the side of the road,

765
01:42:40,010 --> 01:42:41,430
-did you know that?
-Yes.

766
01:42:41,510 --> 01:42:43,810
Five years ago,
you didn't care about telling the truth.

767
01:42:43,890 --> 01:42:47,229
You, all your family, you just assumed
that for all my education,

768
01:42:47,310 --> 01:42:50,439
I was still little better than a servant.
Still not to be trusted!

769
01:42:50,520 --> 01:42:53,569
Thanks to you, they were able to close ranks
and throw me to the fucking wolves!

770
01:42:53,649 --> 01:42:56,649
-Robbie! Look at me, look at me.
-Don't!

771
01:42:56,739 --> 01:43:00,369
Come back. Come back.

772
01:43:02,909 --> 01:43:05,159
Come back to me.

773
01:43:29,189 --> 01:43:30,270
Briony.

774
01:43:32,149 --> 01:43:33,859
There isn't much time.

775
01:43:35,109 --> 01:43:38,859
Robbie has to report for duty at 6:00,
and he's got a train to catch.

776
01:43:40,529 --> 01:43:41,869
So sit down.

777
01:43:47,789 --> 01:43:50,539
There are some things
you're going to do for us.

778
01:44:07,350 --> 01:44:09,100
You'll go to your parents
as soon as you can,

779
01:44:09,180 --> 01:44:10,560
and you'll tell them everything
they need to know

780
01:44:10,640 --> 01:44:13,689
to be convinced
that the evidence you gave was false.

781
01:44:13,770 --> 01:44:15,439
You'll meet with a solicitor,
make a statement,

782
01:44:15,520 --> 01:44:17,689
have it signed, witnessed,
send copies to us. Is that clear?

783
01:44:17,779 --> 01:44:18,899
Yes.

784
01:44:18,989 --> 01:44:21,819
You'll write a detailed letter to me
explaining everything that happened

785
01:44:21,909 --> 01:44:23,909
leading up to you saying
you saw me by the lake.

786
01:44:23,989 --> 01:44:25,239
Try to include whatever you can remember

787
01:44:25,329 --> 01:44:27,119
of what Danny Hardman was doing
that night.

788
01:44:27,199 --> 01:44:28,449
-Hardman?
-Yes.

789
01:44:31,659 --> 01:44:33,329
It wasn't Danny Hardman.

790
01:44:34,210 --> 01:44:36,210
It was Leon's friend, Marshall.

791
01:44:37,050 --> 01:44:38,130
I don't believe you.

792
01:44:38,210 --> 01:44:41,470
He's married Lola.
I've just come from their wedding.

793
01:44:47,470 --> 01:44:50,140
Lola won't be able to testify
against him now.

794
01:44:52,560 --> 01:44:53,979
He's immune.

795
01:45:09,739 --> 01:45:14,500
I'm very, very sorry for the terrible distress
that I have caused.

796
01:45:16,500 --> 01:45:18,750
I am very, very sorry.

797
01:45:19,300 --> 01:45:21,300
Just do as we've asked of you.

798
01:45:21,670 --> 01:45:26,140
Write it all down, just the truth, no rhymes.
No embellishments, no adjectives.

799
01:45:27,890 --> 01:45:29,640
And then leave us be.

800
01:45:31,560 --> 01:45:32,979
I will, I promise.

801
01:46:35,789 --> 01:46:38,000
I'm sorry.
Could we stop for a moment?

802
01:46:39,380 --> 01:46:41,000
Of course. Is something the matter?

803
01:46:41,090 --> 01:46:44,340
I just need a couple of minutes by myself.

804
01:46:46,720 --> 01:46:48,550
...minutes by myself.

805
01:46:49,970 --> 01:46:55,350
Briony Tallis, your new novel,
your twenty-first, is called Atonement. It's...

806
01:46:57,229 --> 01:46:58,310
Briony?

807
01:47:03,529 --> 01:47:05,739
I'm sorry. Could we stop for a moment?

808
01:47:40,979 --> 01:47:45,149
Briony Tallis, I'd like to talk now
about your new novel, Atonement,

809
01:47:45,229 --> 01:47:48,819
which comes out in a few days
to coincide with your birthday.

810
01:47:49,399 --> 01:47:53,829
-It's your twenty-first novel...
-It's my last novel.

811
01:47:55,369 --> 01:47:57,949
Oh, really? Are you retiring?

812
01:47:59,159 --> 01:48:00,500
I'm dying.

813
01:48:02,710 --> 01:48:06,920
My doctor tells me
I have something called vascular dementia,

814
01:48:08,550 --> 01:48:11,630
which is essentially
a continuous series of tiny strokes.

815
01:48:11,720 --> 01:48:17,350
Your brain closes down, gradually
you lose words, you lose your memory,

816
01:48:17,430 --> 01:48:20,479
which for a writer is pretty much the point.

817
01:48:23,310 --> 01:48:27,939
So that's why I could finally write the book,
I think. I had to.

818
01:48:28,779 --> 01:48:31,109
And why, of course, it's my last novel.

819
01:48:34,319 --> 01:48:35,869
Strangely enough,

820
01:48:40,750 --> 01:48:45,079
it would be just as accurate
to call it my first novel.

821
01:48:46,250 --> 01:48:51,470
I wrote several drafts as far back as my time
at St Thomas' Hospital during the War.

822
01:48:52,260 --> 01:48:54,760
I just couldn't ever find the way to do it.

823
01:48:55,550 --> 01:48:58,010
Because the novel is autobiographical,
is that right?

824
01:48:58,100 --> 01:49:01,600
Yes, entirely. I haven't changed any names,
including my own.

825
01:49:01,680 --> 01:49:03,520
And was that the problem?

826
01:49:04,850 --> 01:49:05,979
No.

827
01:49:06,859 --> 01:49:11,609
I had, for a very long time,
decided to tell the absolute truth.

828
01:49:13,109 --> 01:49:15,279
No rhymes, no embellishments.

829
01:49:24,289 --> 01:49:25,630
And I think...

830
01:49:28,670 --> 01:49:31,300
You've read the book,
you'll understand why.

831
01:49:33,300 --> 01:49:37,550
I got first-hand accounts of all the events
I didn't personally witness,

832
01:49:38,180 --> 01:49:43,140
the conditions in prison,
the evacuation to Dunkirk, everything.

833
01:49:44,640 --> 01:49:47,859
But the effect of all this honesty
was rather pitiless.

834
01:49:47,939 --> 01:49:54,029
You see, I couldn't any longer imagine
what purpose would be served by it.

835
01:49:55,529 --> 01:49:58,119
By what? Sorry. Served by honesty?

836
01:49:58,199 --> 01:49:59,329
By honesty.

837
01:50:00,699 --> 01:50:02,039
Or reality.

838
01:50:07,500 --> 01:50:09,380
Because, in fact,

839
01:50:10,710 --> 01:50:15,430
I was too much of a coward
to go and see my sister in June, 1940.

840
01:50:17,220 --> 01:50:19,010
I never made that journey to Balham.

841
01:50:19,100 --> 01:50:20,760
Do you have any idea
what it's like in jail?

842
01:50:20,850 --> 01:50:22,890
So the scene in which
I confess to them is imagined.

843
01:50:22,970 --> 01:50:24,100
He sleeps so deeply.

844
01:50:24,180 --> 01:50:25,229
Invented.

845
01:50:25,310 --> 01:50:28,229
How old do you have to be to know
the difference between right and wrong?

846
01:50:28,310 --> 01:50:30,770
And, in fact,
could never have happened.

847
01:50:30,859 --> 01:50:31,939
Because

848
01:50:34,359 --> 01:50:39,279
Robbie Turner died of septicaemia
at Bray-Dunes

849
01:50:40,409 --> 01:50:42,739
on June the first, 1940,

850
01:50:43,789 --> 01:50:45,869
the last day of the evacuation.

851
01:50:50,750 --> 01:50:51,960
Cheerio, pal.

852
01:51:25,789 --> 01:51:29,829
And I was never able to put things right
with my sister, Cecilia,

853
01:51:31,579 --> 01:51:36,170
because she was killed
on the 15th of October, 1940,

854
01:51:36,510 --> 01:51:40,840
by the bomb that destroyed the gas
and water mains above Balham tube station.

855
01:52:17,590 --> 01:52:18,670
So...

856
01:52:21,220 --> 01:52:24,930
My sister and Robbie were never able
to have the time together

857
01:52:26,510 --> 01:52:30,640
they both so longed for, and deserved.

858
01:52:32,439 --> 01:52:35,319
And which, ever since, I've...

859
01:52:40,399 --> 01:52:44,659
Ever since I've always felt I prevented.

860
01:52:51,250 --> 01:52:54,380
But what sense of hope,

861
01:52:55,960 --> 01:53:00,420
or satisfaction, could a reader derive
from an ending like that?

862
01:53:01,260 --> 01:53:07,810
So, in the book, I wanted to give Robbie
and Cecilia what they lost out on in life.

863
01:53:09,180 --> 01:53:14,439
I'd like to think
this isn't weakness or evasion,

864
01:53:17,069 --> 01:53:19,189
but a final act of kindness.

865
01:53:20,989 --> 01:53:27,739
I gave them their happiness.
