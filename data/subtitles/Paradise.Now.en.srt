1
00:01:58,251 --> 00:02:00,412
To Nablus?

2
00:02:07,326 --> 00:02:09,021
It's still crooked.

3
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,200
- What?
- It's still crooked.

4
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:19,297
- What? The bumper?
- What else?

5
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:23,438
- It's brand-new.
- Maybe, but it's still crooked.

6
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:28,712
- I'll take another look at it, sir.
- What for? It's crooked.

7
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:31,884
- I don't think so.
- Are you saying I'm blind?

8
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:35,020
No, but you might be mistaken.
Looks can be deceiving.

9
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:38,782
My eyes are just fine,
and thank God for that.

10
00:02:38,991 --> 00:02:43,621
- And it's not crooked.
- Yes, it is! It's fucking crooked!

11
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:48,324
- No, it's not.
- Get Abu Salim and have him look at it.

12
00:02:48,534 --> 00:02:50,798
It's not crooked.
You're probably cross-eyed.

13
00:02:51,003 --> 00:02:52,334
What did you say?

14
00:02:52,538 --> 00:02:54,733
It's straight as a ruler.

15
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:57,335
Go get Abu Salim. He'll tell you.

16
00:02:57,543 --> 00:02:59,636
I'll check it with a level.

17
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:10,645
- So who's cross-eyed now?
- You are, sir.

18
00:03:13,059 --> 00:03:16,119
See? The ground's uneven,
but the bumper's straight.

19
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:20,026
Are you trying to screw me over?
I can see it myself.

20
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:24,192
The bumper and the ground are
equally crooked, so the bumper's straight.

21
00:03:24,403 --> 00:03:27,133
Where's Abu Salim?
I want to talk to him. Now!

22
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,741
Please, Abu Salim isn't here.
We'll take care of this.

23
00:03:30,943 --> 00:03:33,207
Didn't you hear me? Go get him!

24
00:03:33,412 --> 00:03:36,677
It's crooked! Just like your father!

25
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,348
- Which side's crooked?
- The right side.

26
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:54,062
Oh, it is indeed crooked.

27
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:57,193
You know you didn't
get this job easily.

28
00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:02,599
- Why don't you say anything?
- Said has nothing to do with this.

29
00:04:02,808 --> 00:04:05,402
I hope you go to jail,
and nobody visits you.

30
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:08,177
Suha, where have you been?

31
00:04:08,614 --> 00:04:12,106
What can I say?
Life is full of surprises.

32
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:14,013
- Is my car ready?
- Of course.

33
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,688
It almost got pregnant here.

34
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:20,315
Said, get the car.

35
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:25,163
Get back here, Khaled!

36
00:04:25,364 --> 00:04:27,355
I'm not through with you.

37
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:32,366
Why do you want this car?
Buy a new one. This one's old.

38
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:35,899
I like old cars. They suit me.

39
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:38,576
An Alfa Romeo would suit you better.

40
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,678
Really? An Alfa?

41
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,973
There aren't many on the west Bank.

42
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:46,982
Because Arabs don't like them.
Parts are expensive and hard to get.

43
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:51,617
Honestly, I don't really
care about cars.

44
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:54,088
But the name sounds nice.

45
00:04:54,293 --> 00:04:55,453
Alfa Romeo.

46
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:04,631
I'll pick it up tomorrow.
The Othman checkpoint is closed today.

47
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:07,362
- Is that a problem?
- No, it's not a problem.

48
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:12,010
Don't make fun of my accent. I was born
in France and grew up in Morocco...

49
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:14,577
...and as you know, I'm back.
- Welcome back.

50
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:17,510
Thanks. See you tomorrow?

51
00:05:18,884 --> 00:05:20,181
God willing.

52
00:05:38,904 --> 00:05:41,395
- It worked.
- It's windy.

53
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:50,312
- What are you doing tomorrow?
- Looking for work.

54
00:06:21,747 --> 00:06:24,716
Where did you get the tape?
It sounds familiar.

55
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:28,551
I found it in Suha's car.

56
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:32,447
Found it, or stole it?

57
00:06:35,294 --> 00:06:36,727
I'll give it back.

58
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:47,329
I think she likes you.

59
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:54,845
Stop it.

60
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:57,875
Lucky guy.
She's Abu Azzam's daughter.

61
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:00,175
All right, I'll stop.

62
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:13,757
Just in time. Great!

63
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:51,035
The tea is cold.

64
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:14,388
Would you mind closing the window?
It's windy.

65
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:18,695
It's automatic, but it's broken. Sorry.

66
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:21,359
I hope it's okay.

67
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:24,533
The repair's 1000 shekels.
Prices are exploding.

68
00:08:26,238 --> 00:08:28,103
One day things will be better.

69
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:31,735
Sounds like you're not from here.
Are you married?

70
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:35,576
- Pardon?
- I asked if you're married.

71
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,497
- See you tomorrow.
- Okay, bye.

72
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:51,312
- Hello.
- Hello, what's up?

73
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:55,249
- I'll have the usual.
- Long time no see.

74
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:56,655
I've been here.

75
00:09:56,862 --> 00:10:01,026
You know, in Sweden
cars stop at traffic lights...

76
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:04,225
...and pedestrians always
watch where they're going.

77
00:10:04,436 --> 00:10:08,304
But they have the highest suicide rate.
What's their problem?

78
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:11,999
What does that have
to do with the dirty whore?

79
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:13,911
They're crazy.

80
00:10:14,346 --> 00:10:17,440
She's so ugly.
I've never seen such an ugly queen.

81
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:22,345
How dare she tell us
what to do with informants.

82
00:10:23,088 --> 00:10:26,114
She cares more for collaborators
than for the people.

83
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:28,384
We should just kill them.

84
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:31,620
Drag them through the streets
by their hair and tear them apart.

85
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,923
- Who are you talking about?
- The collaborators.

86
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,623
Sure.

87
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:38,965
And their families, neighbors
and those who lend them money.

88
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:44,268
So you'd kill everyone. What do
their friends and family have to do with it?

89
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:47,645
What's your problem?
Are you Swedish?

90
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:07,056
Could you move back a bit?

91
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:10,059
A bit more.

92
00:11:11,036 --> 00:11:13,334
Yes! Three centimeters to the left.

93
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:17,268
Exactly. Perfect.

94
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:20,076
Head a little higher.

95
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:21,640
No, a little lower.

96
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:24,406
Back a bit.

97
00:11:26,151 --> 00:11:28,016
Another step back.

98
00:11:29,421 --> 00:11:30,979
Exactly! Don't move.

99
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:34,057
And now smile. Go on.

100
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,754
Smile, I said.

101
00:11:37,262 --> 00:11:41,858
- Or I won't take the picture.
- I don't want to smile.

102
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:43,792
Then I won't take a picture.

103
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:46,865
Do you need them soon?

104
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,843
They'll be ready by tomorrow.

105
00:11:52,277 --> 00:11:53,835
- Good night.
- Good night.

106
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:08,025
How are you?

107
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:10,485
Fine, and you?

108
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:14,193
I can't complain.
How's the repair shop doing?

109
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,266
- As always.
- I heard Khaled got fired?

110
00:12:17,469 --> 00:12:20,370
- Yes, but it wasn't his fault.
- All the same.

111
00:12:20,572 --> 00:12:24,030
It's amazing that he lasted so long.

112
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:27,569
Do you remember
the martyr Abu Azzam?

113
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:33,108
He was very security-minded. He said,
"If you fear death, you're already dead."

114
00:12:33,318 --> 00:12:38,517
If you don't, you'll have
a sudden and painless death.

115
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:41,217
He drove the Mossad crazy.

116
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,222
They spent millions
trying to capture him.

117
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,888
When they surrounded him,
and he knew his fate was sealed...

118
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:52,161
...he opened the door and shouted,
"You've come too late."

119
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:04,939
Listen, Said...

120
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:11,120
we decided to answer the assassination
of Abu Hazem and Um Jaber's son...

121
00:13:12,157 --> 00:13:14,591
...who died in the bombing.

122
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,952
There's an operation planned
for tomorrow in Tel Aviv.

123
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:20,723
You and Khaled were chosen
for this mission.

124
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:24,061
Together like you wanted.

125
00:13:26,004 --> 00:13:28,700
- Tomorrow?
- Yes.

126
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:33,307
- What do you say? Are you ready?
- Yes, if it's God's will.

127
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,818
You'll spend the night
with your family.

128
00:13:43,021 --> 00:13:46,320
Remember, you can't
let anyone find out.

129
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:48,089
Of course not.

130
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,461
I'll stay with you until
you leave Nablus.

131
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,960
- Are you happy?
- Yes, very. Thank God.

132
00:14:02,808 --> 00:14:05,504
- Mother?
- Why are you so late?

133
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:07,542
I was worried about you.

134
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:10,977
"Why are you so late?
I was worried about you."

135
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:13,447
If I came as late as you...

136
00:14:13,652 --> 00:14:17,748
...they'd chain me up
with the dog, if we had one.

137
00:14:17,956 --> 00:14:19,423
Shut up.

138
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:21,621
- How are you, Jamal?
- Fine.

139
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:24,829
How's school? It's good that
you're taking care of the kids.

140
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:25,860
We do our best.
A good education is important.

141
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:30,692
Come in. Thanks, Said.

142
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,598
Take that T-shirt off!

143
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:40,205
That's my best T-shirt,
and you wear it to work.

144
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:43,472
I didn't know. Jamal's
staying overnight, Mother.

145
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:47,311
- They closed the road to Sabastia.
- He's always welcome here.

146
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,215
- Take if off, right now!
- That's enough.

147
00:15:30,495 --> 00:15:32,725
I got a work permit for Israel.

148
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:35,328
I'm going to Tel Aviv tomorrow.

149
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:37,996
- When did you get it?
- Today.

150
00:15:39,304 --> 00:15:42,535
Congratulations.
That's wonderful, my son.

151
00:15:44,509 --> 00:15:47,603
- Have you told Abu Salim?
- No, not yet.

152
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,709
You should. You're lucky
he gave you a job.

153
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:54,675
And he's lucky to have
such cheap labor.

154
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,954
Don't be too sure of yourself.
You don't have a new job yet.

155
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:02,924
But tell me...

156
00:16:03,328 --> 00:16:07,264
...how did you get the permit?
Are they taking young people now?

157
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:11,368
Yes, they're starting to.
Jamal took care of it.

158
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:14,135
God bless him.

159
00:16:15,774 --> 00:16:17,105
Take this.

160
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:25,010
Wow!

161
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:29,009
What is it? What, Khaled?

162
00:16:31,723 --> 00:16:34,385
- Wow!
- What is it?

163
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:38,727
Stop that! Or you'll drive her crazy.
Did you buy the things?

164
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:43,463
- Have you eaten?
- Yes, thanks.

165
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:47,600
But I'd like to stay the night.
They closed the roads to Sabastia.

166
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:49,433
You're always welcome here.

167
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:51,905
What's this?
I already said you could stay.

168
00:17:03,588 --> 00:17:05,351
Pass the salt, please.

169
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:09,018
Would you like some, Jamal?

170
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:30,113
It's delicious.

171
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:33,314
Thanks.

172
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:37,752
Did you change the filter, Mama?
The water tasted better before.

173
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:41,059
Would you turn off
that radio you swallowed?

174
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,174
Said?

175
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:14,075
What's wrong? Is there a problem?

176
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,845
- I'm bringing you the keys.
- What?

177
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:22,483
You're bringing me the keys
at 4 in the morning?

178
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:26,930
Yes, because...

179
00:19:27,999 --> 00:19:30,024
...I kept them by accident.

180
00:19:30,635 --> 00:19:31,829
And...

181
00:19:33,004 --> 00:19:34,562
...I might be gone for a while.

182
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:36,931
Come in.

183
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:38,842
May as well come in,
since you're here.

184
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:41,678
No, I have to go.

185
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,081
Tea?

186
00:19:50,188 --> 00:19:53,214
- How much sugar?
- Four spoons, please.

187
00:19:54,092 --> 00:19:57,186
You're one of those people who
takes tea with their sugar?

188
00:19:58,096 --> 00:20:00,291
Okay, make it three.

189
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:03,033
One thing I don't understand.

190
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:06,363
Why do people from Nablus
put so much sugar in their tea?

191
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:10,469
<i>That's the way it is.</i>
<i>Everybody does it.</i>

192
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:19,173
So, what do you do when you're not
delivering keys at 4 in the morning?

193
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,909
What do you do with your free time?

194
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:25,018
Nothing. I don't know.
What do you mean?

195
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:27,020
Do you go to cafés?

196
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:30,019
Sometimes, to smoke a water pipe.

197
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:33,227
What about sports or reading?

198
00:20:33,499 --> 00:20:35,761
Do you go to the movies?

199
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:38,563
No. There's no cinema
in Nablus anyway.

200
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:39,964
I know.

201
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:42,833
Have you ever been to a cinema before?

202
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:47,477
Yes, once. Ten years ago when
we burned down the Revoly Cinema.

203
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,379
You did that?

204
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:52,777
Not alone. There were lots of us.

205
00:20:53,084 --> 00:20:55,985
Why? What did the cinema
do to you?

206
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:58,384
Not the cinema. Israel.

207
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:01,922
When Israel decided not to employ
any workers from the west Bank...

208
00:21:02,627 --> 00:21:04,094
...we demonstrated.

209
00:21:05,997 --> 00:21:09,023
Then we ended up in the cinema
and set it on fire.

210
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,698
But why the cinema?

211
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:13,731
Why us?

212
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,238
I don't know.

213
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:20,035
You can watch movies on video too.

214
00:21:20,245 --> 00:21:23,578
- So you do watch movies?
- Sometimes.

215
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:28,575
- What's your favorite genre?
- "What's your favorite genre"?

216
00:21:28,853 --> 00:21:31,549
Don't make fun of me. Genre.

217
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:37,054
Type? There are action films,
science fiction, documentaries...

218
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:39,093
...films that make you cry.

219
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:41,055
Is there a boring genre?

220
00:21:42,267 --> 00:21:43,495
Boring?

221
00:21:43,868 --> 00:21:45,096
Like what?

222
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:46,861
Like life.

223
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:49,972
I don't believe you.

224
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:52,910
I'm sure your life isn't boring.

225
00:21:56,181 --> 00:21:57,614
You know what?

226
00:21:58,016 --> 00:22:02,453
I think your life is more like
a minimalist Japanese film.

227
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:05,218
God bless you.

228
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:12,456
Is it true that
you're Abu Azzam's daughter?

229
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:14,757
They say he was a hero.

230
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:16,934
You must be very proud of him.

231
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:21,996
I'd rather he were still alive
than be proud of him.

232
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:25,665
Thanks to him and his fight,
our cause is still alive today.

233
00:22:25,877 --> 00:22:28,812
There are always other ways
to keep the cause alive.

234
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:33,143
That's not for us to decide.
The occupation defines the resistance.

235
00:22:33,818 --> 00:22:36,753
Resistance can take on
many forms.

236
00:22:37,222 --> 00:22:41,318
But we must accept that
we have no military might...

237
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,752
...in order to find alternatives.

238
00:22:44,095 --> 00:22:46,962
And pay the price for
our grandparents' defeat?

239
00:22:47,165 --> 00:22:48,723
Accept the injustice?

240
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:53,931
This discussion is going nowhere.

241
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:11,488
Will I see you again?

242
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:17,489
I hope so.

243
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,090
Fine.

244
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:21,522
Goodbye, my guest of the night.

245
00:24:36,841 --> 00:24:38,035
Khaled.

246
00:24:44,616 --> 00:24:45,913
Here, take this.

247
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:48,712
Say, why does your father limp?

248
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:53,050
During the first Intifada, Israeli
soldiers broke into our house.

249
00:24:53,558 --> 00:24:56,959
They let him choose which leg
he wanted to keep. He chose the right.

250
00:24:57,195 --> 00:25:01,291
I would've let them break both
rather than be so humiliated.

251
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:21,478
It's unbelievable how much
you look like your father.

252
00:25:31,396 --> 00:25:33,557
Knock it off.
Come and drink your coffee.

253
00:25:49,447 --> 00:25:51,005
Tell me about my father.

254
00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:53,141
What was he like?

255
00:25:54,118 --> 00:25:55,949
What's wrong with you today?

256
00:25:56,187 --> 00:25:58,655
Was he like people say he was?

257
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:01,153
Forget it.

258
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,350
What's over is over.

259
00:26:04,629 --> 00:26:06,324
God have mercy on his soul.

260
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:09,293
Said...

261
00:26:09,534 --> 00:26:11,798
...whatever your father did...

262
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:14,432
...he did it for us.

263
00:26:17,141 --> 00:26:18,972
The thing is...

264
00:26:21,212 --> 00:26:23,009
The world changes.

265
00:26:24,282 --> 00:26:26,614
Everything changes, except God.

266
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:29,677
You'll see.

267
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,892
Oh, my God.

268
00:26:43,001 --> 00:26:44,730
Your future is blank.

269
00:26:48,172 --> 00:26:50,572
Naughty boy. You scared me.

270
00:26:50,808 --> 00:26:52,332
Will you ever grow up?

271
00:26:52,577 --> 00:26:53,874
Good morning.

272
00:26:55,647 --> 00:26:57,512
Good morning, Jamal.

273
00:26:57,982 --> 00:26:59,381
Coffee's ready.

274
00:26:59,584 --> 00:27:01,916
No, thanks. I have to go.

275
00:27:05,423 --> 00:27:08,620
What can you do when there is
no justice or freedom?

276
00:27:08,826 --> 00:27:11,693
The individual has to fight for it.

277
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:16,389
If we give in to the law,
that the strong devours the weak...

278
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:19,167
...then we reduce ourselves
to the level of animals.

279
00:27:19,437 --> 00:27:20,927
That's intolerable.

280
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:24,107
Death is better than inferiority.

281
00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:26,875
Whoever fights for freedom...

282
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:31,081
...can also die for it.

283
00:27:35,219 --> 00:27:37,779
You are the one who
will change things.

284
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:54,235
- Hello.
- Hello.

285
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,044
Hi, Jamal.

286
00:28:10,955 --> 00:28:12,582
Now it's our turn.

287
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:35,171
"In the name of
God the merciful...

288
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,741
In his holy book, God says:

289
00:28:38,082 --> 00:28:41,415
'If you receive a wound,
the people have received a similar one.

290
00:28:41,686 --> 00:28:44,849
Times like these come to pass
so that God can recognize...

291
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:47,286
...the believers
and choose martyrs.

292
00:28:47,492 --> 00:28:49,460
God does not love the unjust.'

293
00:28:49,694 --> 00:28:51,491
God speaks the truth.

294
00:28:52,797 --> 00:28:56,130
As an answer to the injustice,
the occupation and its crimes...

295
00:28:56,367 --> 00:28:58,699
...and in order
to further the resistance...

296
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:01,531
...I have decided to carry out
a martyr operation.

297
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,931
We have no other way to fight.

298
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:09,005
Israel views partnership with
and equality for the Palestinians...

299
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,407
...under the same democratic system...

300
00:29:11,616 --> 00:29:14,050
...as suicide for the Jewish state.

301
00:29:14,552 --> 00:29:17,919
Nor will they accept
a two-state compromise...

302
00:29:18,122 --> 00:29:21,819
...even though that is not
fair to the Palestinians.

303
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:27,159
We are to either accept
the occupation forever or disappear.

304
00:29:27,598 --> 00:29:30,931
We've tried with all possible means
to end the occupation...

305
00:29:31,135 --> 00:29:33,968
...with political
and peaceful means.

306
00:29:34,806 --> 00:29:38,037
Despite it all, Israel continues
to build settlements...

307
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:42,337
...confiscate land, Judaize
Jerusalem and carry out ethnic cleansing.

308
00:29:43,514 --> 00:29:47,746
They use their war machine and their
political and economical might...

309
00:29:47,985 --> 00:29:50,647
...to force us to accept
their solution:

310
00:29:51,055 --> 00:29:55,116
That either we accept
inferiority, or we will be killed.

311
00:29:56,194 --> 00:29:58,094
As a martyr,
I am not afraid of death.

312
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:02,925
This is how I will overcome
their threats and emerge victorious...

313
00:30:03,167 --> 00:30:05,863
...over their military and political force.

314
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:08,004
Let me die as a martyr.

315
00:30:13,444 --> 00:30:15,571
Dear Mother, dear Father...

316
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:21,452
...I apologize for saying
goodbye in this way...

317
00:30:22,353 --> 00:30:25,811
...but we will soon be reunited.

318
00:30:26,824 --> 00:30:28,689
I bid you farewell.

319
00:30:29,293 --> 00:30:33,593
This is my testimony: There is only
one God, and Mohammed is his prophet.

320
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:35,932
God speaks the truth."

321
00:30:46,844 --> 00:30:48,277
So how was it?

322
00:30:51,916 --> 00:30:55,215
The camera didn't record.
Something's not working.

323
00:30:56,087 --> 00:30:59,113
Doesn't matter, we'll do it again.

324
00:31:13,404 --> 00:31:15,429
"In the name of God the merciful...

325
00:31:16,908 --> 00:31:19,433
- In his holy book, God says..."
- Stop.

326
00:31:19,944 --> 00:31:21,309
It's not working.

327
00:31:21,512 --> 00:31:24,037
- Can your wife fix it?
- Relax, Khaled.

328
00:31:24,482 --> 00:31:27,849
Now you have the chance
to do it better.

329
00:31:38,796 --> 00:31:39,990
Ready.

330
00:31:51,475 --> 00:31:53,238
"In the name of God the merciful...

331
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:57,707
'lf you receive a wound, the people
have received a similar one.

332
00:31:58,749 --> 00:32:01,274
Times like these come to pass..."'

333
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:15,292
Mother...

334
00:32:16,734 --> 00:32:17,928
...before I forget...

335
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:21,431
...I saw some good water filters
at Al Mokhtar...

336
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,533
...much cheaper than at Kanaze.

337
00:32:25,977 --> 00:32:27,877
Buy them there next time.

338
00:32:29,747 --> 00:32:31,715
Are we supposed to record that?

339
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:35,745
- No, I just forgot to tell my mom.
- All right.

340
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:40,557
"In the name of
God the merciful...

341
00:32:43,961 --> 00:32:46,054
we must continue our struggle...

342
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:48,656
...until the end of the occupation.

343
00:32:51,002 --> 00:32:53,061
<i>Our bodies are all we have left...</i>

344
00:32:54,505 --> 00:32:55,995
<i>... to fight with...</i>

345
00:32:56,207 --> 00:32:58,232
...against the never-ending occupation."

346
00:34:23,294 --> 00:34:24,693
Hold this.

347
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,308
So?

348
00:36:03,027 --> 00:36:04,426
Abu Karem.

349
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:13,129
- Good day.
- And to you.

350
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:15,328
- Who is Said, and who is Khaled?
- I'm Khaled.

351
00:36:15,539 --> 00:36:16,733
I'm Said.

352
00:36:17,575 --> 00:36:20,976
It's my great honor to see you
before you go.

353
00:36:23,414 --> 00:36:25,882
You are strong-willed.

354
00:36:26,984 --> 00:36:28,178
Have you eaten well?

355
00:36:28,385 --> 00:36:30,216
Yes, very well.

356
00:36:33,023 --> 00:36:34,388
Did you explain everything?

357
00:36:34,592 --> 00:36:35,991
I was just about to.

358
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:49,303
This honor is granted only to a few.

359
00:36:49,773 --> 00:36:52,469
After you've ascended to heaven...

360
00:36:52,676 --> 00:36:55,668
...we'll take care of everything here...

361
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:59,148
...and commemorate your heroic courage.

362
00:37:01,051 --> 00:37:02,541
Any requests?

363
00:37:04,588 --> 00:37:05,885
I hope...

364
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:10,450
...that my family isn't made to pay for this.

365
00:37:10,661 --> 00:37:14,028
And I want our posters
to hang in the town center.

366
00:37:14,231 --> 00:37:17,667
You're our pride and joy.
Your families are our families.

367
00:37:18,102 --> 00:37:19,501
We'll protect them.

368
00:37:21,238 --> 00:37:22,569
Let's go.

369
00:37:25,176 --> 00:37:29,579
This is the first major operation
in two years.

370
00:37:30,481 --> 00:37:34,679
It has been carefully planned.
The whole world will be surprised.

371
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:37,211
You haven't been chosen by chance.

372
00:37:37,621 --> 00:37:41,523
We know you have the potential
to carry out the mission.

373
00:37:44,161 --> 00:37:46,026
We will always be with you.

374
00:38:05,649 --> 00:38:07,116
We are proud of you.

375
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,890
Wow! The legend himself.

376
00:38:19,997 --> 00:38:24,491
This belt has a lock mechanism.
It's a new system.

377
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:28,564
Once activated, it can't
be removed. Only we can do that.

378
00:38:28,772 --> 00:38:32,071
Any attempt to remove it
will trigger the explosion.

379
00:38:33,177 --> 00:38:37,136
If the soldiers discover you, you'll be shot.

380
00:38:37,348 --> 00:38:42,251
So be faster than they are, and
detonate it by pulling this cord.

381
00:38:44,455 --> 00:38:48,289
When the time comes, take out
as many soldiers as you can.

382
00:38:48,859 --> 00:38:52,761
I'm warning you:
They won't take any risks.

383
00:38:52,963 --> 00:38:55,329
If they get suspicious...

384
00:38:55,699 --> 00:38:59,533
...they will kill you from a distance.

385
00:39:01,071 --> 00:39:03,767
Beat them to it by pulling the cord.

386
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:05,435
Understand?

387
00:39:33,937 --> 00:39:37,134
On the other side of the fence,
you'll meet a man named Abu Shabaab.

388
00:39:37,341 --> 00:39:39,775
He'll bring you to the location.

389
00:39:39,977 --> 00:39:41,706
One of you must go first.

390
00:39:41,912 --> 00:39:45,211
The other goes minutes later.

391
00:39:45,582 --> 00:39:47,140
That gives us better results.

392
00:39:48,819 --> 00:39:51,481
Within 15 minutes, the police and soldiers
will swarm in.

393
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:52,553
The second bomb will get them.

394
00:39:53,524 --> 00:39:55,583
What an operation.

395
00:39:56,994 --> 00:40:00,361
Here's a little money and your IDs.

396
00:40:01,598 --> 00:40:03,190
Learn the information by heart.

397
00:40:04,034 --> 00:40:08,334
If anyone asks you anything,
let Abu Shabaab do the talking.

398
00:40:08,539 --> 00:40:12,134
Once in Tel Aviv, say you're from
Jerusalem on your way to a wedding.

399
00:40:12,843 --> 00:40:15,209
- Whose wedding?
- It doesn't matter.

400
00:40:15,412 --> 00:40:18,040
Don't be afraid of the soldiers.

401
00:40:18,248 --> 00:40:21,877
Always look them in the eye.

402
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:23,280
And remember:

403
00:40:23,487 --> 00:40:28,083
You are in control. Their lives
are in your hands. Stay calm.

404
00:40:30,127 --> 00:40:33,062
Never forget the soldier who
discovers you is a dead man.

405
00:40:33,263 --> 00:40:37,825
He has nothing to gain,
because he's afraid of death.

406
00:40:38,035 --> 00:40:41,368
If you're not afraid of death,
you're in control of life.

407
00:40:42,539 --> 00:40:46,873
If he insists on checking you,
let him do so at the gates of paradise.

408
00:40:47,077 --> 00:40:49,375
Then we'll see who's checking whom.

409
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,377
Just leave it to God.

410
00:40:52,916 --> 00:40:54,440
And one more thing.

411
00:40:55,452 --> 00:40:59,513
When the first one carries out
the operation, don't watch him do it.

412
00:41:05,696 --> 00:41:07,061
What happens afterwards?

413
00:41:11,502 --> 00:41:13,493
Two angels will pick you up.

414
00:41:14,371 --> 00:41:15,895
Are you sure?

415
00:41:16,106 --> 00:41:17,300
Absolutely.

416
00:41:17,508 --> 00:41:19,806
You'll see.

417
00:41:51,875 --> 00:41:56,312
Wait here. I'll make sure you get through.

418
00:42:51,001 --> 00:42:52,195
Khaled?

419
00:42:53,103 --> 00:42:54,297
What?

420
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:58,205
Are we doing the right thing?

421
00:42:58,408 --> 00:42:59,841
What do you mean?

422
00:43:03,447 --> 00:43:07,076
Of course. In one hour, we'll be heroes.

423
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:09,677
With God.

424
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,282
In heaven.

425
00:43:24,601 --> 00:43:28,935
We discussed this. You were the one
who said we had no choice.

426
00:43:30,007 --> 00:43:32,305
Under the occupation, we're already dead.

427
00:43:32,509 --> 00:43:33,771
I know, I know.

428
00:43:35,078 --> 00:43:37,273
Is there no other way to stop them?

429
00:43:37,881 --> 00:43:39,143
Are you scared?

430
00:43:39,349 --> 00:43:40,873
No, not scared.

431
00:43:41,752 --> 00:43:43,151
I don't know.

432
00:43:44,354 --> 00:43:46,788
It won't be long, then you'll know.

433
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:48,924
The moment you do it.

434
00:43:52,496 --> 00:43:56,830
Is it true that before you die,
you see your life pass by like on a video?

435
00:43:58,035 --> 00:43:59,764
Is that true?

436
00:44:37,941 --> 00:44:39,306
I'm with you.

437
00:44:47,951 --> 00:44:49,942
Let's go.

438
00:44:52,589 --> 00:44:54,318
Look how dirty your suits are.

439
00:44:55,292 --> 00:44:57,021
Okay, Abu Shabaab is there.

440
00:44:57,227 --> 00:45:01,323
He's an Israeli, but don't worry.
He's well-paid.

441
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:04,633
He doesn't speak Arabic.
How's your English?

442
00:45:04,835 --> 00:45:06,132
So-so.

443
00:45:06,336 --> 00:45:07,530
Good.

444
00:45:07,904 --> 00:45:11,806
Okay, be strong. If you feel weak,
read the Koran and pray.

445
00:45:13,777 --> 00:45:14,971
So...

446
00:45:15,746 --> 00:45:17,737
who'll go first?

447
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:21,983
- Me.
- Me.

448
00:45:27,257 --> 00:45:29,225
- Heads or tails?
- Tails.

449
00:45:30,661 --> 00:45:31,855
Tails.

450
00:45:38,802 --> 00:45:40,360
Good luck, boys.

451
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:14,924
What's wrong?

452
00:47:15,132 --> 00:47:16,656
- Where's Said?
- No idea.

453
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,474
Where's Said?

454
00:48:04,681 --> 00:48:07,673
Gone. We looked everywhere.

455
00:48:07,884 --> 00:48:11,513
Then the helicopters came,
and we couldn't wait any longer.

456
00:48:12,722 --> 00:48:16,556
Put out a description with a photo.
We have to find him, and fast.

457
00:48:19,529 --> 00:48:21,497
Take the belt off.
What are you waiting for?

458
00:48:28,772 --> 00:48:31,366
Pull it off all at once,
then it won't hurt as much.

459
00:48:34,644 --> 00:48:36,805
Couldn't you have used something else?

460
00:48:37,013 --> 00:48:38,446
It has to stick.

461
00:48:38,748 --> 00:48:40,841
We never thought we'd have to remove it.

462
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:49,725
And now?

463
00:48:53,063 --> 00:48:54,530
We wait.

464
00:51:09,833 --> 00:51:13,064
Brothers! We have to leave.

465
00:51:13,703 --> 00:51:17,400
It's possible that Said's been caught,
or he's betrayed us.

466
00:51:17,607 --> 00:51:22,476
We must warn every member
who had contact with him.

467
00:51:22,679 --> 00:51:25,671
That can't be. I know Said.
He didn't betray us.

468
00:51:25,882 --> 00:51:28,009
It's just a precaution.

469
00:51:28,218 --> 00:51:29,412
Jamal.

470
00:51:31,021 --> 00:51:33,888
We planned this operation very carefully.

471
00:51:34,624 --> 00:51:37,058
You were sure about them.

472
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:38,693
I've known them for a long time.

473
00:51:38,895 --> 00:51:42,353
You should've been more careful.
You're putting many fighters at risk.

474
00:51:42,565 --> 00:51:44,999
Scatter them, and we'll keep
the ones we need.

475
00:51:45,802 --> 00:51:48,532
It's more likely that
Abu Shabaab's the traitor.

476
00:51:48,738 --> 00:51:54,108
I doubt it, because he doesn't get paid
until after the operation.

477
00:52:24,974 --> 00:52:26,942
The tile factory, please.

478
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:30,306
Could you close the door again?

479
00:52:30,513 --> 00:52:31,673
It jams.

480
00:52:31,881 --> 00:52:33,405
Shut it hard.

481
00:52:51,234 --> 00:52:52,428
Wedding?

482
00:52:55,038 --> 00:52:59,202
What else? You won't be
carrying tiles in that suit.

483
00:53:00,610 --> 00:53:01,838
No, a wedding.

484
00:53:02,045 --> 00:53:03,706
In the factory?

485
00:53:14,924 --> 00:53:19,293
<i>Polluted water got you down?</i>
<i>Kanaze's filters are the best in town.</i>

486
00:53:19,496 --> 00:53:22,624
<i>Kanaze's filters for clean water</i>
<i>and better health.</i>

487
00:53:22,832 --> 00:53:24,322
Water filters!

488
00:53:25,635 --> 00:53:28,468
All the filters in the world
couldn't clean the water...

489
00:53:28,671 --> 00:53:31,367
...that's been polluted by the settlers.

490
00:53:34,811 --> 00:53:36,836
Did you hear what they found in it?

491
00:53:37,647 --> 00:53:39,808
Do you mind...

492
00:53:40,617 --> 00:53:41,879
No.

493
00:53:42,085 --> 00:53:46,988
No? They found something that
diminishes the quality of sperm.

494
00:53:48,825 --> 00:53:52,727
But they could use rat poison,
and it still wouldn't hurt my sperm.

495
00:53:53,496 --> 00:53:54,929
I have five children.

496
00:54:12,015 --> 00:54:15,917
The operation's been postponed.
They're probably looking for us.

497
00:54:16,119 --> 00:54:19,452
Said didn't betray us.
Something must've gone wrong.

498
00:54:19,656 --> 00:54:22,250
It was all so thoroughly planned.
Something's not right.

499
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:29,657
We'll know soon enough.
We're just taking precautions.

500
00:54:29,866 --> 00:54:32,357
Said's walking around with a bomb.
How will he find us?

501
00:54:32,569 --> 00:54:33,763
Calm down.

502
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:38,805
And we could be hit by
a rocket at any moment.

503
00:54:39,008 --> 00:54:40,703
Then let me do it alone.

504
00:54:41,878 --> 00:54:44,472
The attack is postponed until
we know what's going on.

505
00:54:45,848 --> 00:54:48,009
Said didn't betray us, I know for sure.

506
00:54:48,551 --> 00:54:51,247
Let me try to find him.
I know how he thinks.

507
00:54:51,888 --> 00:54:53,219
I'll find him.

508
00:54:53,990 --> 00:54:58,154
I have to find him.
This operation must be carried out.

509
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:01,458
Everything okay?

510
00:55:02,065 --> 00:55:04,158
If we'd only had them earlier.

511
00:55:04,367 --> 00:55:06,858
They're easy to locate.

512
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:10,335
Abu Shabaab was supposed to give you
the cell phones in Tel Aviv.

513
00:55:11,074 --> 00:55:15,067
We'll be better off if you find Said.
You have until the end of the day.

514
00:55:15,278 --> 00:55:17,906
Otherwise, we'll be forced
to settle it another way.

515
00:57:49,098 --> 00:57:50,326
Said...

516
00:57:50,533 --> 00:57:52,694
Are you getting married?

517
00:57:53,536 --> 00:57:55,265
No, I...

518
00:57:56,873 --> 00:57:58,397
Is Khaled here?

519
00:58:41,884 --> 00:58:44,614
- Where is Said's mother?
- How do I know?

520
00:58:44,821 --> 00:58:47,119
- You're getting it dirty again!
- So what?

521
00:59:08,344 --> 00:59:10,539
- Come in.
- Sorry, I'm in a hurry.

522
00:59:12,114 --> 00:59:13,308
Why the suit?

523
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:17,781
I have to go. If he comes,
please give him this number.

524
00:59:17,987 --> 00:59:20,478
It's important. Goodbye.

525
00:59:56,158 --> 00:59:57,455
Who's there?

526
01:00:15,511 --> 01:00:17,411
Have you seen Khaled?

527
01:00:17,613 --> 01:00:19,410
He was just here.

528
01:00:19,615 --> 01:00:21,606
- What did he say?
- Nothing.

529
01:00:23,386 --> 01:00:26,014
- Can I use the bathroom?
- Sure.

530
01:00:26,856 --> 01:00:29,290
- Wasn't that Said?
- Yes.

531
01:00:29,525 --> 01:00:31,789
Why does he look like a settler?

532
01:01:35,691 --> 01:01:37,556
<i>You cannot alter your fate.</i>

533
01:01:39,128 --> 01:01:40,652
There is no other way.

534
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:46,565
It's God's will.

535
01:02:15,464 --> 01:02:18,399
Look, the sun is rising.

536
01:02:18,601 --> 01:02:20,398
Are you teaming up
with your friend?

537
01:02:21,137 --> 01:02:24,072
- I'm not coming tomorrow.
- Problems? Why the suit?

538
01:02:24,273 --> 01:02:25,706
I'm not coming tomorrow.

539
01:02:25,908 --> 01:02:27,933
As long as you make us coffee...

540
01:02:30,579 --> 01:02:31,944
was Khaled here today?

541
01:02:32,148 --> 01:02:34,582
Thank God I'm rid of him.

542
01:02:37,586 --> 01:02:39,349
- Everything okay?
- Yes.

543
01:02:39,555 --> 01:02:42,353
If you have problems,
you know you can...

544
01:02:45,261 --> 01:02:46,626
Good God.

545
01:02:50,299 --> 01:02:51,732
- Hello.
- Hello.

546
01:02:51,934 --> 01:02:55,165
- My Aziza got sick again.
- That didn't take long.

547
01:02:55,371 --> 01:02:58,863
That terrible noise is back.
Did you hear it?

548
01:02:59,075 --> 01:03:01,270
I'll have Said take another look at it.

549
01:03:01,644 --> 01:03:03,168
Said?

550
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:05,808
Said?

551
01:03:11,253 --> 01:03:13,312
Can you please wait inside?

552
01:03:13,522 --> 01:03:15,183
I'm fine right here.

553
01:03:16,125 --> 01:03:18,389
<i>I can't work like this.</i>

554
01:03:28,704 --> 01:03:31,332
- Idiot!
- Go to hell, you fool!

555
01:03:42,918 --> 01:03:46,615
You can go now.
The problem's fixed.

556
01:03:49,692 --> 01:03:53,492
- What is it?
- Yesterday you were different.

557
01:03:53,696 --> 01:03:55,254
It's nothing.

558
01:03:55,464 --> 01:03:57,295
Then why are you acting
so strange?

559
01:03:57,533 --> 01:04:00,263
It's nothing, believe me. Go now.

560
01:04:01,137 --> 01:04:02,331
Said!

561
01:04:03,205 --> 01:04:06,140
Now your watch is broken.
I'm sorry.

562
01:04:07,443 --> 01:04:08,933
Doesn't matter.

563
01:04:09,678 --> 01:04:11,509
It does matter.

564
01:04:12,848 --> 01:04:15,282
What now?
Should I get it repaired?

565
01:04:15,518 --> 01:04:16,883
No need.

566
01:04:25,327 --> 01:04:26,692
Abu Salim.

567
01:04:27,897 --> 01:04:29,091
Have you seen Said?

568
01:04:29,298 --> 01:04:31,926
You? I thought I was rid of you.

569
01:04:32,134 --> 01:04:35,126
- Whose car? And why the suits?
- Doesn't matter. Have you seen him?

570
01:04:35,337 --> 01:04:37,202
He left with his favorite customer.

571
01:04:37,406 --> 01:04:38,703
- What?
- His favorite customer.

572
01:04:38,908 --> 01:04:41,342
- Who?
- Suha. The daughter of Abu Azzam.

573
01:04:45,915 --> 01:04:48,475
We'll have it fixed in no time.

574
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:52,050
Then I'll feel better.

575
01:05:00,229 --> 01:05:01,924
- Are you?
- Suha, I'm...

576
01:05:02,131 --> 01:05:03,496
Go ahead.

577
01:05:03,699 --> 01:05:07,726
No, it wasn't important.
You go ahead.

578
01:05:11,774 --> 01:05:13,469
Stop. Here's the shop.

579
01:05:17,913 --> 01:05:19,608
Why do you look so angry?

580
01:05:19,815 --> 01:05:21,009
Angry?

581
01:05:21,283 --> 01:05:23,979
You should see me when I'm angry.

582
01:05:24,620 --> 01:05:26,144
That'll be 12 shekels 50.

583
01:05:28,023 --> 01:05:30,548
Excuse me, what's that video?

584
01:05:30,759 --> 01:05:32,920
- The farewell speech of a martyr?
- Yes.

585
01:05:33,128 --> 01:05:35,858
We also have collaborators...

586
01:05:36,699 --> 01:05:37,893
Excuse me?

587
01:05:38,334 --> 01:05:41,064
Confessions of collaborators
before they're shot.

588
01:05:42,171 --> 01:05:43,365
Let's go.

589
01:05:43,572 --> 01:05:45,699
Excuse me, but are they
for sale or for rent?

590
01:05:45,908 --> 01:05:47,273
Both.

591
01:05:47,476 --> 01:05:48,807
For how much?

592
01:05:49,011 --> 01:05:52,242
Fifteen shekels to buy.

593
01:05:53,015 --> 01:05:56,314
If you rent, I'll give it to you
for only 3 shekels.

594
01:05:56,518 --> 01:05:57,644
Thank you.

595
01:05:57,853 --> 01:06:00,981
A martyr video costs the same
as a collaborator video?

596
01:06:01,190 --> 01:06:05,092
We could even charge more
for collaborator videos...

597
01:06:05,294 --> 01:06:06,556
...they're more in demand.

598
01:06:06,762 --> 01:06:09,629
But then I'd have to change
my cashier system.

599
01:06:09,832 --> 01:06:12,198
Goodbye.

600
01:06:12,401 --> 01:06:13,834
What about the watch?

601
01:07:01,583 --> 01:07:04,984
Do you think it's normal
that those videos are for sale?

602
01:07:05,220 --> 01:07:07,154
What's normal around here?

603
01:07:07,389 --> 01:07:11,052
It's sick. Three million people
are struggling to survive.

604
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:12,921
Nablus became a prison.

605
01:07:13,128 --> 01:07:16,655
I don't know what I'm doing here.
What a load of...

606
01:07:16,865 --> 01:07:18,355
My father was a collaborator.

607
01:07:19,401 --> 01:07:20,595
He was executed.

608
01:07:33,482 --> 01:07:35,507
I was 10.

609
01:07:42,658 --> 01:07:44,216
I'm so sorry.

610
01:07:44,426 --> 01:07:46,394
No need to be.

611
01:07:48,564 --> 01:07:50,589
How did you deal with that?

612
01:07:50,799 --> 01:07:51,993
It was okay.

613
01:07:52,201 --> 01:07:55,534
It's not as bad as you might think.

614
01:08:01,010 --> 01:08:04,002
Do you want to talk about it?

615
01:08:04,213 --> 01:08:08,115
What's there to talk about?
Will it end the occupation?

616
01:08:08,317 --> 01:08:12,253
Will I stop remembering that
my father was a collaborator?

617
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:16,524
The whole world knows.

618
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:19,894
- I didn't.
- What do you know?

619
01:08:20,429 --> 01:08:22,056
You come from a different world.

620
01:08:22,264 --> 01:08:25,461
Abu Azzam's daughter,
living in a fancy neighborhood.

621
01:08:30,706 --> 01:08:31,934
What are you talking about?

622
01:08:32,141 --> 01:08:34,371
Why talk? To get your pity?

623
01:08:34,676 --> 01:08:38,043
To entertain people
whose life is a bit better?

624
01:09:17,586 --> 01:09:19,349
- Have you seen Said?
- Another suit?

625
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:22,815
- No, no, no!
- Where's Said?

626
01:09:23,025 --> 01:09:25,687
- Where? Tell me!
- He ran eastwards.

627
01:09:28,564 --> 01:09:30,759
- His father's grave.
- Wait!

628
01:09:35,237 --> 01:09:37,000
Why are you doing this?

629
01:09:37,206 --> 01:09:41,040
If we can't live as equals,
at least we'll die as equals.

630
01:09:41,243 --> 01:09:44,144
If you can kill
and die for equality...

631
01:09:44,346 --> 01:09:47,747
...you should be able to find
a way to be equal in life.

632
01:09:48,450 --> 01:09:50,680
How? Through your
human rights group?

633
01:09:50,886 --> 01:09:52,285
For example!

634
01:09:52,488 --> 01:09:56,618
Then at least the Israelis don't have
an excuse to keep on killing.

635
01:09:57,726 --> 01:10:01,662
Don't be so naive. There can be
no freedom without struggle.

636
01:10:01,897 --> 01:10:04,661
As long as there is injustice,
someone must make a sacrifice.

637
01:10:04,867 --> 01:10:07,961
That's no sacrifice. That's revenge.

638
01:10:08,871 --> 01:10:13,672
If you kill, there's no difference
between victim and occupier.

639
01:10:13,942 --> 01:10:17,537
If we had airplanes,
we wouldn't need martyrs.

640
01:10:17,746 --> 01:10:20,044
That's the difference.

641
01:10:20,249 --> 01:10:25,881
The difference is that
the Israeli military is still stronger.

642
01:10:26,088 --> 01:10:28,386
Then let us be equal in death.

643
01:10:28,590 --> 01:10:30,057
We still have paradise.

644
01:10:30,292 --> 01:10:33,227
There is no paradise.
It only exists in your head.

645
01:10:33,428 --> 01:10:35,692
God forbid!

646
01:10:35,998 --> 01:10:37,431
May God forgive you.

647
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:40,325
If you were not
Abu Azzam's daughter...

648
01:10:43,572 --> 01:10:48,441
Anyway, I'd rather have paradise
in my head than live in this hell.

649
01:10:50,579 --> 01:10:52,410
In this life, we're dead anyway.

650
01:10:54,116 --> 01:10:56,880
One chooses bitterness
when the alternative is even bitterer.

651
01:10:57,085 --> 01:10:59,679
And what about us?
The ones who remain?

652
01:10:59,888 --> 01:11:03,551
Will we win that way?

653
01:11:03,759 --> 01:11:08,128
Don't you see that what
you're doing is destroying us?

654
01:11:08,597 --> 01:11:12,590
And that you give Israel
an excuse to carry on?

655
01:11:12,801 --> 01:11:15,099
So with no excuse, Israel will stop?

656
01:11:15,304 --> 01:11:16,601
Perhaps.

657
01:11:16,805 --> 01:11:19,399
We have to turn it into
a moral war.

658
01:11:19,608 --> 01:11:22,805
How, if Israel has no morals?

659
01:11:23,011 --> 01:11:25,809
Be careful!
Or we'll become traffic martyrs!

660
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:40,321
Bastards.

661
01:12:43,358 --> 01:12:44,950
Said.

662
01:12:45,661 --> 01:12:47,595
Said. Said.

663
01:12:49,431 --> 01:12:50,728
Thank God.

664
01:12:52,434 --> 01:12:54,664
Relax. Just relax.

665
01:12:55,771 --> 01:12:57,033
Calm down.

666
01:12:57,639 --> 01:12:59,300
Was I stupid.

667
01:12:59,508 --> 01:13:01,806
We must find Jamal. Get up.

668
01:13:02,010 --> 01:13:03,341
Get up.

669
01:13:03,545 --> 01:13:04,944
I'm going tomorrow morning.

670
01:13:05,147 --> 01:13:06,978
- Enough!
- What's she doing here?

671
01:13:07,182 --> 01:13:09,810
- Calm down.
- Go, and take her with you.

672
01:13:10,018 --> 01:13:11,986
- I won't leave you.
- Go, take her with you!

673
01:13:12,287 --> 01:13:15,154
- Please, stop!
- Go, and take her with you.

674
01:13:15,357 --> 01:13:16,654
Stop!

675
01:13:17,292 --> 01:13:18,418
- Go.
- Said!

676
01:13:18,627 --> 01:13:20,060
- Said.
- Said.

677
01:13:20,262 --> 01:13:22,423
Said. Said.

678
01:13:33,108 --> 01:13:34,473
Said, stop!

679
01:14:27,496 --> 01:14:29,157
Does it still hurt?

680
01:14:29,364 --> 01:14:30,558
No.

681
01:14:32,934 --> 01:14:34,799
What now?

682
01:14:35,036 --> 01:14:36,333
You tell me.

683
01:14:36,972 --> 01:14:38,166
It's up to you.

684
01:14:39,808 --> 01:14:41,173
What does that mean?

685
01:14:42,043 --> 01:14:45,274
There are no more obstacles
to the operation.

686
01:14:45,981 --> 01:14:49,109
If you want,
we can start right away.

687
01:14:54,723 --> 01:14:56,156
What about Said?

688
01:14:56,358 --> 01:14:58,952
He's fine. He's been tested.

689
01:14:59,828 --> 01:15:01,261
What about you?

690
01:15:03,198 --> 01:15:06,361
I want to speak with Said.
I have to see him.

691
01:15:06,568 --> 01:15:11,198
That's not necessary.
You decide if you stay or if you go.

692
01:15:22,684 --> 01:15:24,447
Listen, Said...

693
01:15:26,555 --> 01:15:30,457
You know what this cost us,
and how many risks we took.

694
01:15:32,194 --> 01:15:34,754
You've ruined everything.

695
01:15:36,064 --> 01:15:39,329
I can no longer rely on you.

696
01:15:40,302 --> 01:15:41,769
I'm sorry.

697
01:15:42,370 --> 01:15:44,304
You can go home.

698
01:15:51,146 --> 01:15:52,443
I was...

699
01:15:53,715 --> 01:15:55,307
...born in a refugee camp.

700
01:15:57,719 --> 01:16:01,155
I was allowed to leave
the west Bank only once.

701
01:16:02,257 --> 01:16:03,952
I was 6 at the time...

702
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:07,554
...and needed surgery.

703
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:09,496
Just that one time.

704
01:16:10,966 --> 01:16:14,732
Life here is like life imprisonment.

705
01:16:17,405 --> 01:16:20,067
The crimes of the occupation
are countless.

706
01:16:20,275 --> 01:16:24,405
The worst crime of all is
to exploit the people's weaknesses...

707
01:16:25,313 --> 01:16:27,406
...and turn them into collaborators.

708
01:16:30,418 --> 01:16:33,353
By doing that,
they not only kill the resistance...

709
01:16:34,422 --> 01:16:36,481
...they also ruin families...

710
01:16:37,125 --> 01:16:40,686
...ruin their dignity
and ruin an entire people.

711
01:16:44,432 --> 01:16:45,729
When my father...

712
01:16:47,102 --> 01:16:51,300
...was executed, I was 10 years old.

713
01:16:52,474 --> 01:16:54,374
He was a good person.

714
01:16:55,944 --> 01:16:57,411
But he grew weak.

715
01:17:00,048 --> 01:17:04,712
For that, I hold
the occupation responsible.

716
01:17:05,487 --> 01:17:08,786
They must understand that
if they recruit collaborators...

717
01:17:09,324 --> 01:17:13,124
...they must pay the price for it.

718
01:17:16,631 --> 01:17:18,462
A life without dignity is worthless.

719
01:17:19,734 --> 01:17:21,702
Especially when it reminds you...

720
01:17:22,904 --> 01:17:27,568
...day after day,
of humiliation and weakness.

721
01:17:35,850 --> 01:17:40,651
And the world watches
cowardly, indifferently.

722
01:17:40,989 --> 01:17:45,517
If you're all alone,
faced with this oppression...

723
01:17:45,827 --> 01:17:50,423
...you have to find
a way to stop the injustice.

724
01:17:53,435 --> 01:17:56,768
They must understand that
if there's no security for us...

725
01:17:56,972 --> 01:17:58,701
...there'll be none for them either.

726
01:17:58,907 --> 01:18:02,843
It's not about power.
Their power doesn't help them.

727
01:18:09,718 --> 01:18:13,210
I tried to deliver this message to them...

728
01:18:13,421 --> 01:18:15,412
...but I couldn't find another way.

729
01:18:16,358 --> 01:18:19,293
Even worse,
they've convinced the world...

730
01:18:19,494 --> 01:18:23,089
...and themselves
that they are the victims.

731
01:18:24,065 --> 01:18:26,659
How can that be?
How can the occupier be the victim?

732
01:18:28,803 --> 01:18:33,035
If they take on the role
of oppressor and victim...

733
01:18:34,409 --> 01:18:38,937
...then I have no other choice
but to also be a victim...

734
01:18:40,515 --> 01:18:42,915
...and a murderer as well.

735
01:18:46,254 --> 01:18:49,348
I don't know how you'll decide...

736
01:18:49,958 --> 01:18:51,926
...but I will not return
to the refugee camp.

737
01:18:59,267 --> 01:19:00,825
I'm going to pray.

738
01:20:00,128 --> 01:20:01,322
Said.

739
01:20:02,197 --> 01:20:03,926
Said!

740
01:20:06,367 --> 01:20:07,834
How did you decide?

741
01:20:18,546 --> 01:20:19,774
Where is he?

742
01:20:54,883 --> 01:20:56,316
I'm sorry.

743
01:21:56,511 --> 01:21:58,945
In case you are lost,
you can call me on this phone.

744
01:21:59,147 --> 01:22:00,580
Just press here.

745
01:22:00,815 --> 01:22:02,077
Good luck.

746
01:22:14,829 --> 01:22:18,162
Said, listen to me. Said.

747
01:22:19,634 --> 01:22:22,762
Listen. Answer me!

748
01:22:22,971 --> 01:22:24,461
Why did you come? Why are you here?

749
01:22:24,706 --> 01:22:26,901
To be with you. Let's go back.

750
01:22:27,108 --> 01:22:30,976
Suha was right. We won't win this way.

751
01:22:32,847 --> 01:22:35,372
We do what we have to.
God decides the rest.

752
01:22:35,583 --> 01:22:40,418
But God says, "Think first."
We kill and are killed, and nothing changes.

753
01:22:40,622 --> 01:22:44,718
Not our death, but the continuation
of resistance will change something.

754
01:22:44,926 --> 01:22:47,156
I have no other option.

755
01:22:47,829 --> 01:22:51,356
And if it doesn't change anything?
Answer me.

756
01:22:51,566 --> 01:22:54,296
There are other means of
liberation and resistance.

757
01:22:54,502 --> 01:22:55,935
Perhaps for others.

758
01:22:56,971 --> 01:23:00,566
<i>For you too. You're coming back with me.</i>
<i>I won't let you die.</i>

759
01:23:00,775 --> 01:23:03,437
You're coming back with me.
Give me the phone.

760
01:23:14,455 --> 01:23:15,820
Hello?

761
01:23:17,025 --> 01:23:18,686
<i>- Come back.</i>
<i>- Come back?</i>

762
01:23:18,893 --> 01:23:20,884
We want to go back.

763
01:23:22,330 --> 01:23:23,592
Yes.

764
01:23:23,932 --> 01:23:25,160
<i>- Sorry?</i>
<i>- Think again.</i>

765
01:23:25,366 --> 01:23:27,664
No, no. No thinking again.

766
01:23:28,336 --> 01:23:29,564
Yes, he also.

767
01:23:29,771 --> 01:23:32,001
<i>- I want to talk to him.</i>
<i>- You want to speak to him?</i>

768
01:23:32,206 --> 01:23:33,434
Here.

769
01:23:34,776 --> 01:23:37,472
Speak. Speak!

770
01:23:37,745 --> 01:23:39,679
<i>- Yes, this is Said.</i>
<i>- You want to come back?</i>

771
01:23:39,881 --> 01:23:41,974
Yes, come back. Me too.

772
01:24:31,232 --> 01:24:32,199
Go!

773
01:24:32,667 --> 01:24:34,601
Said, open the door!

774
01:24:34,802 --> 01:24:36,770
Open the door!

775
01:24:37,972 --> 01:24:39,337
Go!

776
01:24:39,841 --> 01:24:42,139
Said!
