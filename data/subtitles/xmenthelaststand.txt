1
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:12,780
I still don't know
why l'm here.

2
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:14,823
Couldn't you just
make them say yes?

3
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:17,200
Yes, I could,
but it's not my way.

4
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:19,203
And I would expect you,
of all people,

5
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:22,206
would understand my feelings
about the misuse of power.

6
00:01:22,289 --> 00:01:26,210
Ah, "power corrupts" and all that.
Yes, I know, Charles.

7
00:01:26,335 --> 00:01:27,972
When are you going to
stop lecturing me?

8
00:01:27,972 --> 00:01:29,320
When you start listening.

9
00:01:30,093 --> 00:01:32,424
And you're here
because I need you.

10
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:35,426
We're not gonna have to meet
every one of them in person, are we?

11
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:39,182
No. This one's special.

12
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:41,768
What a beautiful campus.

13
00:01:41,894 --> 00:01:44,936
- John, don't you think?
- Yes, the brochure is great.

14
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:50,026
But what about Jean?
What about her... illness?

15
00:01:50,109 --> 00:01:52,485
- Illness?
-John.

16
00:01:52,569 --> 00:01:54,822
You think your daughter
is sick, Mr. Grey?

17
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:58,741
Perhaps it would be best if
we were to speak to her, alone.

18
00:01:58,825 --> 00:02:01,995
Of course.
Jean?

19
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:04,206
Can you come down, dear?

20
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:17,637
We'll, uh, leave you then.

21
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:29,146
It's very rude, you know, to read my
thoughts or Mr. Lehnsherr's...

22
00:02:29,233 --> 00:02:31,067
without our permission.

23
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,265
Did you think

24
00:02:32,265 --> 00:02:34,814
you were the only one
of your kind, young lady?

25
00:02:34,814 --> 00:02:38,199
We're mutants, Jean.
We are like you.

26
00:02:39,241 --> 00:02:42,411
Really?
I doubt that.

27
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:01,013
Oh, Charles.

28
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:03,223
I like this one.

29
00:03:03,306 --> 00:03:06,853
You have more power
than you can imagine, Jean.

30
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:10,479
The question is,
will you control that power...

31
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,651
or let it control you?

32
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:36,973
Warren?

33
00:03:37,837 --> 00:03:39,222
Son, is everything all right?

34
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:44,139
- What's going on in there?
- Nothing! I'll be right out.

35
00:03:44,223 --> 00:03:46,161
Come on. You've been
in there for over an hour.

36
00:03:48,591 --> 00:03:49,548
Open the door.

37
00:03:49,582 --> 00:03:52,021
Warren?
One second!

38
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:56,569
Open this door!

39
00:03:56,651 --> 00:03:58,485
Warren?

40
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:02,949
Let me in there right now!
Open the door!

41
00:04:18,507 --> 00:04:20,675
Oh, God.

42
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:22,720
Not you.

43
00:04:22,802 --> 00:04:25,014
Dad, I'm sorry.

44
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,029
The whole world's goin' to hell,
you're just gonna sit there?

45
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:55,641
Let's go.

46
00:06:07,074 --> 00:06:09,160
Bobby!

47
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,250
Thanks, Kitty.

48
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,125
We're getting killed out here.

49
00:06:25,456 --> 00:06:27,095
Yeah, I know.
They're not ready, Storm.

50
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,348
- Logan. - Oh, don't get your
panties in a bunch.

51
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:39,105
That was my last cigar.

52
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:41,942
Logan!

53
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:44,444
lt's getting closer!

54
00:06:44,528 --> 00:06:49,199
- Come on! Let's keep moving!
- Hey, Tin Man! Come here!

55
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:52,536
- How's your throwing arm?
- Logan, we work as a team.

56
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:56,165
Yeah, good luck with that.
Throw me. Now!

57
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,334
Damn it, Logan!
Don't do this!

58
00:07:16,403 --> 00:07:17,838
Class dismissed.

59
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:24,860
Hey, Colossus,
nice throw.

60
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:29,697
Simulation complete.

61
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:35,286
What the hell was that?

62
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:37,343
- Danger Room session.
- You know what I mean.

63
00:07:37,562 --> 00:07:39,473
- Oh, lighten up, Storm. - Look,
you can't just change the rules

64
00:07:39,473 --> 00:07:40,244
when you feel like it.

65
00:07:40,244 --> 00:07:41,567
I'm tryin' to
teach 'em something.

66
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,625
I taught 'em something.

67
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,149
- It was a defensive exercise.
- Yeah.

68
00:07:45,149 --> 00:07:46,630
Best defense is a good offense.

69
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:48,136
Or is it the other way around?

70
00:07:48,683 --> 00:07:50,026
This isn't a game, Logan.

71
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:52,762
Well, you sure fooled me.

72
00:07:52,848 --> 00:07:54,021
Hey, I'm just a sub.

73
00:07:54,021 --> 00:07:55,466
You got a problem,
talk to Scott.

74
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:16,661
- Scott!
-Jean.

75
00:08:16,745 --> 00:08:18,956
Scott. Scott.

76
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:23,459
Scott. Scott.

77
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:25,588
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

78
00:08:28,151 --> 00:08:29,161
Well, you don't seem fine.

79
00:08:29,161 --> 00:08:30,293
You seem like you're
avoiding me.

80
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:31,375
I mean, something's wrong.

81
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:33,831
What's wrong is I can't touch
my boyfriend without killin' him.

82
00:08:33,831 --> 00:08:35,165
Other than that,
I'm wonderful.

83
00:08:35,597 --> 00:08:36,303
Hey.

84
00:08:36,914 --> 00:08:37,828
I don't think that's fair.

85
00:08:37,828 --> 00:08:39,231
Have I ever put
any pressure on you?

86
00:08:39,267 --> 00:08:42,437
You're a guy, Bobby.
Your mind's only on one thing.

87
00:08:46,149 --> 00:08:47,014
Hey, Scott,

88
00:08:47,014 --> 00:08:48,802
they were lookin' for you
downstairs. You didn't show.

89
00:08:48,802 --> 00:08:50,696
- What do you care?
- Well, for starters,

90
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:51,885
I had to cover your ass.

91
00:08:51,907 --> 00:08:54,200
- I didn't ask you to.
- No, you didn't.

92
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:56,951
The professor did.
I was just passing through.

93
00:08:57,076 --> 00:09:00,331
- So pass through, Logan.
- Hey, look.

94
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:03,750
- I know how you feel.
- Don't.

95
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:06,253
- When Jean died--
- I said don't.

96
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:10,298
Maybe it's time for us
to move on.

97
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:16,803
Not everybody heals
as fast as you, Logan.

98
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:42,498
- Mr. Secretary?
- Yes.

99
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:46,835
- The meeting's begun, sir.
- Thank you.

100
00:09:53,341 --> 00:09:56,595
- Mr. President.
- Have a seat, Hank.

101
00:09:58,846 --> 00:10:01,807
Homeland Security
was tracking Magneto.

102
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:05,562
We got hits in Lisbon,
Geneva, Montreal.

103
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:07,562
NAVSAT lost him
crossing the border.

104
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:10,859
But we did get
a consolation prize.

105
00:10:10,942 --> 00:10:12,746
We picked her up
breaking into the F.D.A.,

106
00:10:12,746 --> 00:10:13,734
of all places.

107
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:15,249
Do you know who
she's been imitating?

108
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,105
Secretary Trask here.

109
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,119
Yes, sir.
She can do that.

110
00:10:20,201 --> 00:10:22,913
Not anymore, she can't.
We got her.

111
00:10:23,038 --> 00:10:24,725
You think your prisons
can hold her?

112
00:10:24,725 --> 00:10:26,048
We have some new prisons, Hank.

113
00:10:26,082 --> 00:10:28,335
We'll keep them mobile.
Be a step ahead this time.

114
00:10:28,418 --> 00:10:31,336
Where is Magneto?

115
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:33,340
Raven?

116
00:10:33,423 --> 00:10:36,009
Raven, I asked you a question.

117
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:38,095
I don't answer
to my slave name.

118
00:10:38,177 --> 00:10:41,212
Raven Darkholme.
That's your real name,

119
00:10:41,248 --> 00:10:41,267
isn't it?

120
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:42,524
Or has he convinced you

121
00:10:42,524 --> 00:10:44,268
you don't have
a family anymore?

122
00:10:44,976 --> 00:10:48,105
My family tried to kill me,
you pathetic meat sack.

123
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:51,524
Okay, then. Mystique.

124
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:53,902
Where is he?

125
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:58,822
In here with us.

126
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:01,344
I don't want to
play games with you.

127
00:11:01,344 --> 00:11:02,556
I want answers.

128
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,580
You don't want to
play games with me?

129
00:11:04,663 --> 00:11:08,917
You are gonna stop this.
Tell me, where is Magneto?

130
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:13,254
You want to know
where he is?

131
00:11:21,596 --> 00:11:23,599
Homo sapien!

132
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:32,356
You know her capture
will only provoke Magneto.

133
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:35,402
But having her does give us
some diplomatic leverage.

134
00:11:35,485 --> 00:11:39,365
On principle, I can't
negotiate with these people.

135
00:11:39,447 --> 00:11:41,740
I thought that's why
you appointed me, sir.

136
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,701
Yes, it is.

137
00:11:43,826 --> 00:11:46,205
- But that's not why
you called me here. - No.

138
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:50,042
This is. It's what she
stole from the F.D.A.

139
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:59,841
Dear Lord.

140
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:03,053
- Is it viable?
- We believe it is.

141
00:12:05,139 --> 00:12:07,572
You realize the level
of impact this will have

142
00:12:07,572 --> 00:12:10,126
on the mutant community?
- Yes, I do.

143
00:12:10,126 --> 00:12:14,691
That's precisely why we need
some of your... diplomacy now.

144
00:12:18,403 --> 00:12:21,240
When an individual
acquires great power,

145
00:12:21,322 --> 00:12:25,201
the use or misuse of
that power is everything.

146
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:27,202
Will it be for the greater good?

147
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:31,917
Or will it be used for personal
or for destructive ends?

148
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,753
Now, this is a question
we must all ask ourselves.

149
00:12:34,836 --> 00:12:37,629
Why?
Because we are mutants.

150
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:40,551
For psychics, this presents
a particular problem.

151
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:42,702
When is it acceptable
to use our power,

152
00:12:42,702 --> 00:12:45,123
and when do we cross
that invisible line...

153
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:47,932
that turns us into tyrants
over our fellow man?

154
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:51,769
But Einstein said that ethics are
an exclusive human concern...

155
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:54,398
without any superhuman
authority behind it.

156
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,110
Einstein wasn't a mutant...
so far as we know.

157
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:02,445
Now, this case study was
sent to me by a colleague,

158
00:13:02,445 --> 00:13:04,590
Dr. Moira MacTaggert.
Jones.

159
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:09,288
The man you see here was born
with no higher-level brain functions.

160
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:11,298
His organs and
nervous system work,

161
00:13:11,298 --> 00:13:13,727
but he has no consciousness
to speak of.

162
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:17,961
Now, what if we were to transfer
the consciousness of one person,

163
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:21,323
say a father off our
with terminal cancer,

164
00:13:21,323 --> 00:13:23,600
into the body of this man?

165
00:13:23,885 --> 00:13:25,095
How are we to decide

166
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:27,961
what falls within the range of
ethical behavior and what--

167
00:13:42,153 --> 00:13:44,154
Professor?

168
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,783
We'll continue this tomorrow.

169
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:50,076
Class dismissed.

170
00:13:57,586 --> 00:14:00,214
The forecast was
for sunny skies.

171
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:03,634
Oh. I'm sorry.

172
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:14,172
I don't have to be psychic

173
00:14:14,172 --> 00:14:16,043
to see that something's
bothering you.

174
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,731
l don't understand.

175
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:20,841
Magneto's a fugitive.

176
00:14:20,841 --> 00:14:23,855
We have a mutant in the cabinet,
a president who understands us.

177
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:25,961
- Why are we still hiding?
- We're not hiding.

178
00:14:25,961 --> 00:14:27,854
But we still have
enemies out there.

179
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:29,414
And I must
protect my students.

180
00:14:29,414 --> 00:14:30,105
You know that.

181
00:14:30,105 --> 00:14:32,287
Yes, but we can't
be students forever.

182
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:36,289
Storm, I hadn't thought of you
as my student for years.

183
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,504
In fact, I thought that,
perhaps,

184
00:14:38,956 --> 00:14:40,981
you might take
my place some day.

185
00:14:45,216 --> 00:14:47,969
- But Scott's--
- Scott's a changed man.

186
00:14:48,355 --> 00:14:50,188
He took Jean's death so hard.

187
00:14:51,014 --> 00:14:53,225
Yes, things are
better out there.

188
00:14:53,307 --> 00:14:55,414
But you, of all people,
know how fast

189
00:14:55,414 --> 00:14:56,923
the weather can change.

190
00:14:57,144 --> 00:14:59,147
There's something
you're not tellin' us.

191
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:12,033
Hank?

192
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,080
Ororo! Charles.

193
00:15:15,163 --> 00:15:17,541
Oh!

194
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:19,705
- I love what you've done
with your hair. - Mmm.

195
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:21,552
- You too.
- Thanks.

196
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:23,712
Thank you for seeing me
on such short notice.

197
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:26,148
Henry, you are
always welcome here.

198
00:15:26,148 --> 00:15:27,488
You're a part of this place.

199
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:30,302
- I have news.
- Is it Eric?

200
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:32,971
No. Though we have been making
some progress on that front.

201
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:35,067
Mystique was
recently apprehended.

202
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:36,316
Who's the furball?

203
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:40,230
Hank McCoy,
Secretary of Mutant Affairs.

204
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:41,745
Right, right.
The secretary.

205
00:15:42,344 --> 00:15:43,090
Nice suit.

206
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:45,567
- Henry, this is Logan.
He's, uh... - Wolverine.

207
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:48,614
- I hear you're quite an animal.
- Look who's talkin'.

208
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:51,533
You know Magneto's gonna
come get Mystique, right?

209
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:53,020
Magneto's not the problem.

210
00:15:53,469 --> 00:15:54,903
At least not our most
pressing one.

211
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:56,971
A major pharmaceutical company

212
00:15:56,971 --> 00:15:58,794
has developed
a mutant antibody--

213
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:01,802
a way to suppress
the mutant "X" gene.

214
00:16:02,222 --> 00:16:03,053
Suppress?

215
00:16:03,086 --> 00:16:06,755
Permanently.
They're calling it a cure.

216
00:16:11,302 --> 00:16:12,256
Well, that's ridiculous.

217
00:16:12,725 --> 00:16:15,653
- You can't cure being a mutant.
- Well, scientifically speaking--

218
00:16:15,653 --> 00:16:17,042
Since when did we
become a disease?

219
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:18,422
- How can anybody
in their right... - Storm.

220
00:16:20,134 --> 00:16:21,591
They're announcing it now.

221
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:30,864
These so-called mutants
are peoplejust like us.

222
00:16:30,947 --> 00:16:33,783
Their affliction is
nothing more than a disease,

223
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:37,202
a corruption of
healthy cellular activity.

224
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:40,664
But I stand here today to
tell you there's hope.

225
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,854
And this site,

226
00:16:42,024 --> 00:16:43,698
once the world's
most famous prison,

227
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,644
will now be
the source of freedom

228
00:16:46,182 --> 00:16:48,133
 for all mutants
who choose it.

229
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:52,219
Ladies and gentlemen,
I proudly present...

230
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:54,678
the answer to mutation.

231
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:58,182
Finally, we have a cure.

232
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,298
Who would want this cure?

233
00:17:03,298 --> 00:17:06,094
I mean, what kind of coward
would take it just to fit in?

234
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:10,903
Is it cowardice to save
oneself from persecution?

235
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:15,031
Not all of us can fit in so easily.
You don't shed on the furniture.

236
00:17:15,116 --> 00:17:16,906
Well, for all we know,

237
00:17:16,906 --> 00:17:18,166
the government helped
cook this up.

238
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:20,268
I can assure you the government
had nothing to do with this.

239
00:17:20,268 --> 00:17:21,574
Well, I've heard that before.

240
00:17:21,789 --> 00:17:24,127
My boy, I have been
fighting for mutant rights

241
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:25,810
since before you had claws.

242
00:17:25,846 --> 00:17:27,752
Did he just call me "boy"?

243
00:17:27,837 --> 00:17:30,923
Is it true?
They can cure us?

244
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:34,300
Yes, Rogue.
It appears to be true.

245
00:17:36,846 --> 00:17:40,892
No, Professor.
They can't cure us.

246
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:45,605
You want to know why?
Because there's nothin' to cure.

247
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:49,482
Nothing's wrong with you.
Or any of us, for that matter.

248
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:55,865
How should we, as mutants,
respond? Here's what I think.

249
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,906
This is about getting organized,

250
00:17:58,086 --> 00:18:00,979
bringing our complaints
to the right people.

251
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:02,863
We need to
put together a committee

252
00:18:02,863 --> 00:18:04,743
and talk to the government.

253
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,040
They don't understand.

254
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,952
They don't know what it
means to be a mutant.

255
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:15,203
We need to show them,
educate them, let them know

256
00:18:15,203 --> 00:18:16,957
that we're here to stay.

257
00:18:17,011 --> 00:18:20,847
- Come on.
- People, you must listen.

258
00:18:20,932 --> 00:18:24,519
- They won't take us seriously.
- They want to exterminate us.

259
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:29,941
This cure is voluntary.
Nobody's talking about
extermination.

260
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:32,152
No one ever talks about it.

261
00:18:33,653 --> 00:18:36,198
They just do it.

262
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,740
And you go on
with your lives,

263
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:42,452
ignoring the signs
all around you.

264
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:43,508
And then, one day,

265
00:18:43,508 --> 00:18:46,393
when the air is still
and the night has fallen,

266
00:18:46,427 --> 00:18:48,182
they come for you.

267
00:18:48,182 --> 00:18:49,699
- Excuse me, but--
- It's only then you realize,

268
00:18:49,699 --> 00:18:52,255
while you were talking about
organizing and committees,

269
00:18:52,338 --> 00:18:54,548
the extermination
has already begun.

270
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:59,260
Make no mistake, my brothers.
They will draw first blood.

271
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:03,097
They will force
their cure upon us.

272
00:19:03,182 --> 00:19:08,188
The only question is, will you
join my brotherhood and fight...

273
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:11,441
or wait for
the inevitable genocide?

274
00:19:11,526 --> 00:19:17,445
Who will you stand with,
the humans... or us?

275
00:19:26,539 --> 00:19:28,915
You talk pretty tough
for a guy in a cape.

276
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:32,671
Back off.

277
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:34,635
If you're so proud
of being a mutant,

278
00:19:34,635 --> 00:19:35,477
where's your mark?

279
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:40,171
I have been
marked once, my dear,

280
00:19:40,171 --> 00:19:41,374
and let me assure you...

281
00:19:41,409 --> 00:19:44,182
no needle shall ever
touch my skin again.

282
00:19:44,307 --> 00:19:45,822
You know who
you're talkin' to?

283
00:19:47,818 --> 00:19:48,645
Do you?

284
00:19:51,397 --> 00:19:54,526
And what can you do?

285
00:19:54,608 --> 00:19:57,153
Hmm. So, you have talents.

286
00:19:57,238 --> 00:20:01,030
That and more.
I know you control metal.

287
00:20:01,115 --> 00:20:03,053
And I know there's
87  mutants in here

288
00:20:03,053 --> 00:20:04,737
and none of them
above a class three,

289
00:20:05,403 --> 00:20:07,538
other than you two.

290
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,791
You can sense other mutants
and their powers?

291
00:20:11,876 --> 00:20:14,546
Mm-hmm.

292
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,839
Could you locate one for me?

293
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:37,777
Let me out of here!

294
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:42,030
l demand that you release me!
Do you know who l am?

295
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:44,159
I'm the president
ofthe United States.

296
00:20:44,241 --> 00:20:47,577
Oh, Mr. President.
Shut up!

297
00:20:49,624 --> 00:20:53,041
Why are you doing this to me?
Let me down.

298
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:57,881
l'll be a good girl.
Please, let me go. Please?

299
00:20:57,963 --> 00:21:00,798
Keep it up. I'll spray you
in the face, bitch.

300
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:07,766
When I get out of here,
I'm gonna kill you myself.

301
00:21:07,848 --> 00:21:10,308
Yeah, right.

302
00:21:38,337 --> 00:21:41,298
Secretary McCoy,
welcome to Worthington Labs.

303
00:21:41,384 --> 00:21:43,843
Thankyou, Dr. Rao.
Not an easy place to get to.

304
00:21:43,926 --> 00:21:46,096
It's the safest location
we could find.

305
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,640
That's why we keep
the source of the cure here.

306
00:21:48,722 --> 00:21:50,201
He is a mutant.

307
00:21:50,544 --> 00:21:51,972
You understand
our concern.

308
00:21:52,309 --> 00:21:55,144
We are in full compliance
with your department's policy.

309
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,146
How long will you
keep the boy here?

310
00:21:57,231 --> 00:21:59,522
Until we can fully map
his D.N.A. We can replicate it,

311
00:21:59,522 --> 00:22:01,859
but we can't generate it.

312
00:22:00,943 --> 00:22:05,323
- And his power, what is
its range? - You'll see.

313
00:22:08,993 --> 00:22:11,828
Jimmy?

314
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:14,958
There's someone
I would like you to meet.

315
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,000
Hello there, son.

316
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:20,586
- Hi. - My name is
Hank McCoy.

317
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:29,221
I'm sorry.

318
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:32,267
It's okay.

319
00:22:41,067 --> 00:22:43,028
You have an amazing gift.

320
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:45,069
Thank you, Jimmy.

321
00:22:54,913 --> 00:22:58,166
Extraordinary,
isn't he?

322
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:00,461
Yes, he is.

323
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:41,044
Scott.

324
00:23:45,214 --> 00:23:50,885
Scott.

325
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:53,387
Scott. Scott.

326
00:23:53,472 --> 00:23:56,557
Can you hear me? I'm still here.
Scott. Scott.

327
00:23:56,683 --> 00:23:58,559
- Stop.
- I'm here, Scott!

328
00:23:58,685 --> 00:24:00,563
- Stop it.
- Scott.

329
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:03,022
- Scott. Scott!
- Stop it.

330
00:24:04,108 --> 00:24:08,488
- Scott! Scott!
- Stop!

331
00:25:05,211 --> 00:25:09,589
- Jean?
- Scott?

332
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:14,095
How?

333
00:25:18,893 --> 00:25:20,977
I don't know.

334
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:37,992
I want to see your eyes.

335
00:25:39,953 --> 00:25:43,875
- Take these off.
- No.

336
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:46,044
No.

337
00:25:46,126 --> 00:25:49,756
Trust me.
I can control it now.

338
00:25:56,846 --> 00:26:00,473
Open them.
You can't hurt me.

339
00:26:28,252 --> 00:26:31,506
Scott. Scott. Scott. Scott.

340
00:26:35,425 --> 00:26:37,426
- What happened?
- No clue!

341
00:26:37,511 --> 00:26:39,931
Professor, you okay?

342
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:42,182
Get to Alkali Lake.

343
00:27:10,421 --> 00:27:14,007
- You don't want to be here.
- Do you?

344
00:27:36,903 --> 00:27:39,365
I can't see a damn thing.

345
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:41,866
I can take care of that.

346
00:27:58,050 --> 00:28:00,053
What the...

347
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:36,631
Logan!

348
00:28:41,051 --> 00:28:44,346
- Oh, God.
- She's alive.

349
00:28:48,018 --> 00:28:50,019
Jean?

350
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,210
The sheer mass of water that
collapsed on top of Jean

351
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:58,474
should have
obliterated her completely.

352
00:28:58,693 --> 00:29:02,240
The only explanation of Jean's
survival is that her powers...

353
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:05,826
wrapped her in a cocoon
oftelekinetic energy.

354
00:29:06,952 --> 00:29:09,788
Is she gonna be okay?

355
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:12,750
Jean Grey is the only class five
mutant I've ever encountered,

356
00:29:12,835 --> 00:29:14,836
her potential
practically limitless.

357
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,013
Her mutation is seated

358
00:29:17,013 --> 00:29:18,744
in the unconscious part
of her mind,

359
00:29:18,744 --> 00:29:20,423
and therein lay the danger.

360
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:21,775
When she was a girl,

361
00:29:21,775 --> 00:29:24,895
I created a series
of psychic barriers...

362
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:27,682
to isolate her powers
from her conscious mind.

363
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:28,654
And, as a result,

364
00:29:28,654 --> 00:29:31,265
Jean developed
a dual personality.

365
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:33,813
What?

366
00:29:33,895 --> 00:29:35,135
The conscious Jean,

367
00:29:35,135 --> 00:29:36,976
whose powers were always
in her control...

368
00:29:36,982 --> 00:29:40,067
and the dormant side,

369
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:43,448
a personality that,
in our sessions,

370
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:46,031
came to call itself
the Phoenix...

371
00:29:46,116 --> 00:29:50,121
a purely instinctual creature,
all desire and joy...

372
00:29:50,203 --> 00:29:52,457
and rage.

373
00:29:52,539 --> 00:29:55,250
She knew all this?

374
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:57,836
It's unclear how much she knew.

375
00:29:57,921 --> 00:30:00,461
Far more critical is whether
the woman in front of us

376
00:30:00,461 --> 00:30:02,097
is the Jean Grey we know...

377
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:06,563
or the Phoenix furiously
struggling to be free.

378
00:30:06,563 --> 00:30:08,147
She looks pretty peaceful to me.

379
00:30:08,147 --> 00:30:09,833
Because I'm keeping her
that way.

380
00:30:09,892 --> 00:30:12,192
I'm trying to restore
the psychic blocks

381
00:30:12,192 --> 00:30:13,880
and cage the beast again.

382
00:30:15,603 --> 00:30:16,645
What have you done to her?

383
00:30:17,507 --> 00:30:19,339
Logan,
you have to understand--

384
00:30:19,339 --> 00:30:21,516
You're talkin' about a person's
mind here, about Jean.

385
00:30:21,516 --> 00:30:23,266
She has to be controlled.

386
00:30:23,266 --> 00:30:24,066
Control?

387
00:30:24,747 --> 00:30:26,391
You know, sometimes
when you cage the beast,

388
00:30:26,391 --> 00:30:27,520
the beast gets angry.

389
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,597
You have no idea.

390
00:30:30,038 --> 00:30:32,522
You have no idea
of what she's capable.

391
00:30:32,522 --> 00:30:33,588
No, Professor.

392
00:30:33,588 --> 00:30:35,650
l had no idea what
you were capable of.

393
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:39,251
I had a terrible choice to make.
I chose the lesser of two evils.

394
00:30:39,336 --> 00:30:42,507
Well, it sounds to me
like Jean had no choice at all.

395
00:30:42,589 --> 00:30:46,093
I don't have to
explain myself,

396
00:30:46,176 --> 00:30:48,761
least of all to you.

397
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:57,635
History will be
made here today.

398
00:30:57,635 --> 00:30:58,685
For the first time,

399
00:30:58,685 --> 00:31:02,049
the so-called "mutant cure"
will be available to the public.

400
00:31:02,049 --> 00:31:03,726
Now, reaction has run the gamut,

401
00:31:03,726 --> 00:31:05,578
with mutants on
both sides of the line.

402
00:31:05,614 --> 00:31:07,615
Some are desperate
for this cure,

403
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:10,910
while others are offended
by the very idea of it.

404
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:26,884
Is Secretary McCoy
going to be a problem?

405
00:31:27,223 --> 00:31:28,145
Hard to say.

406
00:31:28,145 --> 00:31:29,518
His political views seem

407
00:31:29,518 --> 00:31:32,310
somewhat at odds
with his personal issues.

408
00:31:32,597 --> 00:31:36,183
Excuse me, sir?
Your son's arrived.

409
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:38,310
Good.
Bring him in.

410
00:31:38,395 --> 00:31:40,565
You sure you want to
start with him?

411
00:31:40,647 --> 00:31:43,025
I think
it's important, yes.

412
00:31:44,568 --> 00:31:47,069
- Hello, Warren.
- How are you, Son?

413
00:31:47,197 --> 00:31:48,990
- You sleep well?
- Yeah.

414
00:31:49,074 --> 00:31:52,159
You know, I'm proud of you
for doing this.

415
00:31:52,286 --> 00:31:56,497
- Everything's gonna be fine.
I promise. - Yeah.

416
00:31:57,833 --> 00:31:59,834
You ready?

417
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:31,905
The transformation
can be a little jarring.

418
00:32:36,828 --> 00:32:38,913
Dad, can we talk
about this for a sec?

419
00:32:38,999 --> 00:32:42,000
We've talked about it, Son.
It'll all be over soon.

420
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:45,127
Everything's going to be fine.

421
00:32:45,211 --> 00:32:47,506
Wait.

422
00:32:47,589 --> 00:32:51,384
- I can't do this.
- Warren, calm down.

423
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:54,096
- No. I-I can't do this.
- Yes, you can.

424
00:32:54,181 --> 00:32:56,390
- Okay, just give me a minute--
-Just relax, Son. Take it easy.

425
00:32:56,473 --> 00:32:58,250
- No! I can't do this!
- Calm down. I promise you,

426
00:32:58,250 --> 00:32:59,322
- it will be fine!
- Dad!

427
00:32:59,322 --> 00:33:00,483
Warren, relax!

428
00:33:09,069 --> 00:33:14,156
Warren, it's a better life.
It's what we all want.

429
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,242
No. It's what you want.

430
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:22,124
Warren! No!

431
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:38,826
Told you so.

432
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:58,137
- About time.
- I've been busy.

433
00:34:58,221 --> 00:34:59,599
Did you find what
you were looking for?

434
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:01,213
The source of the cure
is a mutant,

435
00:35:01,706 --> 00:35:03,576
a child at Worthington Labs.

436
00:35:03,576 --> 00:35:05,166
Without him,
they have nothing.

437
00:35:06,396 --> 00:35:09,190
Read off the guest list.

438
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:13,860
Cell 41 205.
James Madrox.

439
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:16,030
This one robbed seven banks...

440
00:35:21,952 --> 00:35:23,331
at the same time.

441
00:35:23,702 --> 00:35:25,860
I could use a man
of your talents.

442
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:29,876
- I'm in.
- Welcome to the Brotherhood.

443
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:34,389
Careful with this one.

444
00:35:34,688 --> 00:35:37,559
Cain Marko.
Solitary confinement.

445
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:38,856
Now, check this out.

446
00:35:39,208 --> 00:35:41,762
"Prisoner must be confined
at all times.

447
00:35:41,762 --> 00:35:44,791
lf he builds any momentum,
no object can stop him."

448
00:35:45,192 --> 00:35:46,596
How fascinating.

449
00:35:49,231 --> 00:35:52,233
- And what do they call you?
-Juggernaut.

450
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:53,981
I can't imagine why.

451
00:35:54,498 --> 00:35:56,500
You gonna let me out of here?
I need to pee.

452
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:11,460
- Nice helmet.
- Keeps my face pretty.

453
00:36:11,545 --> 00:36:14,699
I think he'll make
a fine addition to our army.

454
00:36:15,009 --> 00:36:15,663
Yeah.

455
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:18,384
No!

456
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:46,494
You saved me.

457
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,791
Eric?

458
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:56,922
I'm sorry, my dear.

459
00:36:57,007 --> 00:36:59,632
You're not
one of us anymore.

460
00:37:05,222 --> 00:37:08,309
Such a shame.
She was so beautiful.

461
00:37:14,481 --> 00:37:16,387
You think resigning's
gonna make a difference?

462
00:37:16,387 --> 00:37:18,291
That's no way to
influence policy.

463
00:37:18,445 --> 00:37:21,112
Policy is being made
without me, Mr. President.

464
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:23,088
The decision to
turn the cure into a weapon

465
00:37:23,088 --> 00:37:24,405
was made without me.

466
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:26,884
What happened on that
convoy was inexcusable.

467
00:37:26,884 --> 00:37:28,407
But your actions--

468
00:37:28,407 --> 00:37:30,157
Hank, that was
an isolated incident.

469
00:37:30,157 --> 00:37:31,371
You have to understand.

470
00:37:31,596 --> 00:37:33,541
Those mutants
were a real threat.

471
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:36,503
Have you even begun to think
what a slippery slope you're on?

472
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:39,340
I have.

473
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:44,364
And I worry about how
democracy survives

474
00:37:44,364 --> 00:37:46,574
when one man can move
cities with his mind.

475
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,931
As do I.

476
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:54,980
You and I know that it's
only going to get worse.

477
00:37:55,065 --> 00:37:58,192
All the more reason why
I need to be where I belong.

478
00:38:27,097 --> 00:38:29,974
Jean.

479
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:36,938
- Hey, Logan.
- Welcome back.

480
00:38:38,565 --> 00:38:40,567
Back where we first met.

481
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:44,947
Only I was in your place
and you were in mine.

482
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:47,074
You okay?

483
00:38:49,244 --> 00:38:51,244
Yeah.

484
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:56,250
More than okay.

485
00:39:07,971 --> 00:39:10,931
Logan, you're making me blush.

486
00:39:12,181 --> 00:39:15,309
- Are you reading my thoughts?
- I don't have to.

487
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:37,291
It's okay.

488
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:17,623
- Wait.
- No.

489
00:40:23,378 --> 00:40:24,755
Jean,

490
00:40:25,925 --> 00:40:29,034
- this isn't you.
- Yes. Yes, it is me.

491
00:40:29,068 --> 00:40:33,222
No. Maybe you ought to
take it easy, huh?

492
00:40:33,306 --> 00:40:36,391
The professor said
you might be...

493
00:40:36,476 --> 00:40:39,268
different.

494
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:41,480
He would know, wouldn't he?

495
00:40:41,563 --> 00:40:43,898
What?

496
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:45,436
You think he's not
in your head too?

497
00:40:46,501 --> 00:40:47,646
Look at you, Logan.

498
00:40:49,239 --> 00:40:52,239
He's tamed you.

499
00:40:55,327 --> 00:40:57,538
Where's Scott?

500
00:41:00,125 --> 00:41:01,958
Jean?

501
00:41:02,043 --> 00:41:05,128
Where am I?

502
00:41:05,213 --> 00:41:07,255
You're in the mansion.

503
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:10,925
You need to tell me
what happened to Scott.

504
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:17,391
Jean, tell me
what happened to him.

505
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:33,407
Oh, God.

506
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:40,246
Look at me.

507
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:44,626
Jean, stay with me.

508
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:46,943
Talk to me.

509
00:41:47,291 --> 00:41:49,213
- Look at me.
Look at me! - No.

510
00:41:49,213 --> 00:41:51,047
Focus! Focus, Jean!

511
00:41:52,594 --> 00:41:56,262
- Kill me.
- What?

512
00:41:56,389 --> 00:41:58,594
Kill me before
I kill someone else.

513
00:41:58,594 --> 00:41:59,737
- Don't say that.
- Please.

514
00:42:00,271 --> 00:42:00,954
Stop it.

515
00:42:01,657 --> 00:42:02,688
Kill me.

516
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:07,315
Stop it. Look at me.
Look at me. Jean.

517
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:10,110
It'll be all right.
We can help you.

518
00:42:10,195 --> 00:42:12,387
Okay?
The professor can help.

519
00:42:12,387 --> 00:42:13,398
He can fix it.

520
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:15,782
I don't want to fix it!

521
00:42:27,003 --> 00:42:32,132
Voluntary?
They put the cure in a gun.

522
00:42:32,217 --> 00:42:34,425
I told you they would
draw first blood.

523
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:37,679
- So what do we do?
- What do we do?

524
00:42:37,764 --> 00:42:39,775
We use this weapon
as a lightning rod

525
00:42:39,775 --> 00:42:41,827
to bring countless more
to our cause.

526
00:42:43,228 --> 00:42:46,480
Come. We have
an army to build.

527
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:53,445
I picked something up.
An electromagnetic force.

528
00:42:53,527 --> 00:42:57,032
It's massive.
It's... a mutant.

529
00:42:57,559 --> 00:42:58,666
Class five.

530
00:42:59,443 --> 00:43:01,762
More powerful than anything
I've ever felt.

531
00:43:01,871 --> 00:43:04,206
More powerful than you.

532
00:43:07,043 --> 00:43:09,168
Where is she?

533
00:43:11,838 --> 00:43:14,090
Logan?

534
00:43:14,175 --> 00:43:16,467
- Jean? Jean!
- What happened?

535
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:18,844
What have you done?

536
00:43:22,891 --> 00:43:25,768
- I think she killed Scott.
- What?

537
00:43:28,021 --> 00:43:32,525
- That's not possible.
- I warned you.

538
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:37,762
She's left the mansion,

539
00:43:37,762 --> 00:43:39,407
but she's trying to
block my thoughts.

540
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:42,034
She's so strong.

541
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:46,039
It may be too late.

542
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:52,628
- Wait for me here.
- What?

543
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:55,465
I need to see Jean alone.

544
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:59,260
You were right, Charles.
This one is special.

545
00:43:59,344 --> 00:44:01,304
What the hell
are you doing here?

546
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:04,266
The same as the professor.
Visiting an old friend.

547
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:06,643
I don't want trouble here.
Nor do I, Charles.

548
00:44:06,728 --> 00:44:09,228
So, shall we go inside?

549
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:13,567
I came to bring Jean home.
Don't interfere, Eric.

550
00:44:13,782 --> 00:44:15,438
Just like old times, huh?

551
00:44:15,474 --> 00:44:18,822
She needs help.
Jean is not well.

552
00:44:18,905 --> 00:44:22,617
Funny. You sound
just like her parents.

553
00:44:22,702 --> 00:44:24,869
Nobody gets inside.

554
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:13,190
- I knew you'd come.
- Of course.

555
00:45:13,567 --> 00:45:15,090
I've come to bring you home.

556
00:45:15,338 --> 00:45:17,505
- I have no home.
- Yes, you do.

557
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:19,672
You have a home
and a family.

558
00:45:19,759 --> 00:45:22,960
He thinks your power is
too great for you to control.

559
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:25,143
- Eric. - I don't believe
your mind games

560
00:45:25,143 --> 00:45:26,724
are going to work
anymore, Charles.

561
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:29,476
- So you want to control me?
- No.

562
00:45:29,601 --> 00:45:31,936
- He does. - No.
I want to help you.

563
00:45:32,021 --> 00:45:36,273
Help me?
What's wrong with me?

564
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:38,318
- Absolutely nothing.
- Eric, stop!

565
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:41,405
No, Charles! Not this time!
You've always held her back!

566
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:44,614
For your own good, Jean.

567
00:45:44,699 --> 00:45:47,034
Stay out of my head.

568
00:45:50,123 --> 00:45:50,922
I'm goin' in.

569
00:45:51,797 --> 00:45:53,373
The professor said
he'd handle this.

570
00:46:00,047 --> 00:46:01,088
Look at me, Jean.

571
00:46:02,025 --> 00:46:03,992
- I can help you.
Look at me! - No.

572
00:46:04,503 --> 00:46:07,764
Get out of my head.

573
00:46:07,849 --> 00:46:09,827
Perhaps you should
listen to her, Charles.

574
00:46:09,827 --> 00:46:10,760
You must trust me.

575
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:12,686
You're a danger to
everyone and yourself!

576
00:46:12,858 --> 00:46:14,074
But I can help you!

577
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:15,838
I think you want to
give her the cure!

578
00:46:16,181 --> 00:46:17,630
Look what happened to Scott!

579
00:46:17,692 --> 00:46:19,420
You killed the man you love

580
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:22,679
- because you couldn't control
your power! - No! Stop it!

581
00:46:25,407 --> 00:46:27,701
That's it.

582
00:47:09,619 --> 00:47:12,204
Jean, let me in.

583
00:48:14,724 --> 00:48:17,643
No, Jean!
Jean!

584
00:49:17,413 --> 00:49:19,914
Don't let it control you.

585
00:49:28,882 --> 00:49:30,675
Charles!

586
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:00,496
My dear, come with me.

587
00:50:19,474 --> 00:50:21,809
Oh, God!

588
00:50:21,893 --> 00:50:24,728
No.

589
00:50:56,804 --> 00:50:59,304
We live in an age of darkness,

590
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:02,056
a world full of fear,

591
00:51:02,143 --> 00:51:05,393
hate and intolerance.

592
00:51:05,478 --> 00:51:07,130
But in every age,

593
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:09,289
there are those
who fight against it.

594
00:51:09,983 --> 00:51:15,195
Charles Xavier was born
into a world divided,

595
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:18,614
a world he tried to heal--

596
00:51:18,701 --> 00:51:21,619
a mission he never
saw accomplished.

597
00:51:22,148 --> 00:51:24,181
It seems the destiny
of great men

598
00:51:24,181 --> 00:51:26,557
to see their goals
unfulfilled.

599
00:51:27,543 --> 00:51:30,835
Charles was more than a leader,
more than a teacher.

600
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:32,838
He was a friend.

601
00:51:32,922 --> 00:51:36,509
When we were afraid,
he gave us strength.

602
00:51:36,594 --> 00:51:40,512
And when we were alone,
he gave us a family.

603
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:44,934
He may be gone,
but his teachings...

604
00:51:45,018 --> 00:51:48,771
live on through us,
his students.

605
00:51:48,856 --> 00:51:52,442
Wherever we may go,
we must carry on his vision.

606
00:51:52,525 --> 00:51:56,695
And that's a vision
of a world united.

607
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:23,181
Kitty?

608
00:52:23,264 --> 00:52:25,349
Bobby?

609
00:52:27,893 --> 00:52:30,396
- You okay?
- Yeah.

610
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,735
Ah, it's just...

611
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:39,864
Xavier came to my house.

612
00:52:39,949 --> 00:52:42,449
He was the one that
convinced me to come here.

613
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:43,876
Yeah, me too.

614
00:52:45,284 --> 00:52:46,688
We're all feelin'
the same way, you know.

615
00:52:46,688 --> 00:52:49,331
No, Bobby, we're not.

616
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:51,708
You have Rogue and I have--

617
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:56,255
You know,
I-- I just miss home.

618
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:59,425
The first snow
and all of that.

619
00:53:02,221 --> 00:53:06,014
- Kitty, get up. Come with me.
- Storm told us to stay in our rooms.

620
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:07,375
Don't worry.
We won't get caught.

621
00:53:08,307 --> 00:53:10,222
I mean, you can walk
through walls, you know.

622
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:11,742
Come on.

623
00:53:24,827 --> 00:53:26,827
This place
can be home too.

624
00:53:52,478 --> 00:53:54,438
Bobby. Bobby!
Okay. Come on.

625
00:53:54,523 --> 00:53:56,481
Whoa!

626
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:07,784
Thank you for this,
Bobby.

627
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:27,889
You need a lift, kid?

628
00:54:27,972 --> 00:54:30,141
No.

629
00:54:31,851 --> 00:54:33,853
Where're you going?

630
00:54:35,356 --> 00:54:37,856
You don't know what it's like
to be afraid of your powers,

631
00:54:37,942 --> 00:54:40,400
to be afraid to
get close to anybody.

632
00:54:40,485 --> 00:54:42,737
Yeah, I do.

633
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:46,239
I wanna be able
to touch people, Logan.

634
00:54:47,742 --> 00:54:52,038
A hug, a handshake,
a kiss.

635
00:54:52,121 --> 00:54:55,041
I hope you're not
doing this for some boy.

636
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:01,630
Look, if you wanna go,
then go.

637
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:03,715
Just be sure
it's what you want.

638
00:55:06,135 --> 00:55:07,728
Shouldn't you
be telling me to stay,

639
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:10,733
to go upstairs and unpack?

640
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:13,184
I'm not your father.
I'm your friend.

641
00:55:16,688 --> 00:55:19,440
Think about
what I said, Rogue.

642
00:55:19,525 --> 00:55:24,527
Marie.

643
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:05,445
Do you remember
when we first met?

644
00:56:05,527 --> 00:56:06,581
Do you know what I saw

645
00:56:07,061 --> 00:56:08,288
when I looked at you?

646
00:56:08,907 --> 00:56:12,492
I saw the next stage
in evolution,

647
00:56:12,577 --> 00:56:16,371
what Charles and I
dreamt of finding.

648
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:19,250
And I thought to myself,
"Why would Charles...

649
00:56:19,333 --> 00:56:22,670
want to turn this goddess
into a mortal?"

650
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:30,418
I can manipulate
the metal in this,

651
00:56:31,496 --> 00:56:32,389
but you...

652
00:56:32,847 --> 00:56:37,476
you can do anything,
anything you can think of.

653
00:56:47,945 --> 00:56:49,905
Jean--

654
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:51,949
Enough.

655
00:56:53,534 --> 00:56:55,494
Enough!

656
00:56:57,998 --> 00:56:59,436
You sound just like him.

657
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:01,239
Jean,

658
00:57:01,239 --> 00:57:02,900
he wanted to
hold you back.

659
00:57:03,501 --> 00:57:04,775
What do you want?

660
00:57:04,797 --> 00:57:07,340
I want you
to be what you are,

661
00:57:07,422 --> 00:57:10,384
as nature intended.

662
00:57:12,054 --> 00:57:14,137
That cure is meant
for all of us.

663
00:57:14,222 --> 00:57:18,266
If we want freedom,
we must fight for it.

664
00:57:19,768 --> 00:57:22,063
And that fight
begins now.

665
00:57:30,822 --> 00:57:33,489
She shouldn't
be here with us.

666
00:57:33,574 --> 00:57:35,867
Her power's
completely unstable.

667
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:37,184
Only in the wrong hands.

668
00:57:37,346 --> 00:57:38,925
You trust her?
She's one of them.

669
00:57:39,373 --> 00:57:40,590
So were you once.

670
00:57:40,858 --> 00:57:42,340
I stuck with you
all the way.

671
00:57:42,376 --> 00:57:43,507
I would've killed
the professor

672
00:57:43,507 --> 00:57:44,775
if you'd given me the chance.

673
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:48,556
Charles Xavier
did more for mutants

674
00:57:48,556 --> 00:57:49,697
than you'll ever know.

675
00:57:51,175 --> 00:57:52,322
My single greatest regret

676
00:57:52,322 --> 00:57:55,469
is that he had to die
for our dream to live.

677
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:15,248
So what now?
What do we do?

678
00:58:15,461 --> 00:58:17,168
Professor Xavier
started this school,

679
00:58:17,168 --> 00:58:19,063
perhaps it's best
that it end with him.

680
00:58:19,413 --> 00:58:21,371
We'll have to tell the students
they're going home.

681
00:58:21,456 --> 00:58:23,416
Must of us don't have
anywhere to go.

682
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:26,581
I can't believe this.

683
00:58:26,829 --> 00:58:28,907
I can't believe we're not
gonna fight for this school.

684
00:58:36,304 --> 00:58:39,056
l'm sorry. l know
this is a bad time.

685
00:58:39,141 --> 00:58:42,101
I was told that this was
a safe place for mutants.

686
00:58:43,268 --> 00:58:45,271
It was, son.

687
00:58:49,358 --> 00:58:50,639
And it still is.

688
00:58:51,818 --> 00:58:52,958
We'll find you a room.

689
00:58:53,155 --> 00:58:56,114
Hank, tell all the students
this school stays open.

690
00:59:11,632 --> 00:59:13,547
Rogue.

691
00:59:14,635 --> 00:59:16,552
Hey, Rogue.

692
00:59:25,728 --> 00:59:27,730
Hey, Pete,
you seen Rogue?

693
00:59:27,813 --> 00:59:29,815
Yeah, she took off.

694
00:59:43,621 --> 00:59:45,706
Logan.

695
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:47,875
Logan!

696
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:50,503
- Logan.
- Jean?

697
00:59:50,585 --> 00:59:52,713
Logan, where am l?
Logan!

698
00:59:52,797 --> 00:59:54,672
Logan.
Logan. Logan.

699
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:57,635
- God!
- Logan!

700
00:59:57,719 --> 01:00:00,346
Logan. Logan. Logan.

701
01:00:19,992 --> 01:00:22,827
- Where're you goin'?
- Where do you think?

702
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:25,121
She's gone, Logan.
She's not comin' back.

703
01:00:25,204 --> 01:00:28,206
- You don't know that.
- She killed the professor.

704
01:00:29,365 --> 01:00:30,318
It wasn't Jean.

705
01:00:30,764 --> 01:00:32,476
The Jean I know
is still in there.

706
01:00:34,284 --> 01:00:35,420
- Listen--
- Outta my way.

707
01:00:35,420 --> 01:00:36,889
Why can't you see
the truth, huh?

708
01:00:37,114 --> 01:00:39,300
- Why can't you just
let her go? - Because--

709
01:00:40,056 --> 01:00:42,387
- Because--
- Because you love her.

710
01:00:52,815 --> 01:00:55,443
She made her choice.
Now it's time we make ours.

711
01:00:55,527 --> 01:00:57,902
So if you're with us,
then be with us.

712
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:15,123
We don't need a cure!
We don't need a cure!

713
01:01:26,925 --> 01:01:28,909
Gettin' the cure
so you can go back home

714
01:01:28,909 --> 01:01:30,101
to Mommy and Daddy?

715
01:01:32,606 --> 01:01:35,231
I'm lookin' for someone.

716
01:01:35,317 --> 01:01:37,318
Oh, l get it.

717
01:01:37,402 --> 01:01:39,777
Your girlfriend.

718
01:01:40,905 --> 01:01:42,822
I figured
she'd want the cure.

719
01:01:42,907 --> 01:01:44,824
She's pathetic.

720
01:01:48,996 --> 01:01:51,289
Come on, Iceman.

721
01:01:52,793 --> 01:01:54,751
Make a move.

722
01:02:00,217 --> 01:02:02,385
Same old Bobby.

723
01:02:02,469 --> 01:02:04,469
Still afraid of a fight!

724
01:02:16,315 --> 01:02:19,443
Today's attack
was only our first salvo.

725
01:02:19,527 --> 01:02:23,572
So long as the cure exists,
our war will rage.

726
01:02:23,657 --> 01:02:27,492
Your cities will not be safe.
Your streets will not be safe.

727
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:29,954
You will not be safe.

728
01:02:30,038 --> 01:02:33,958
And to my fellow mutants,
I make you this offer--

729
01:02:34,041 --> 01:02:36,835
join us or stay out
of our way.

730
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:40,088
Enough mutant blood
has been spilled already.

731
01:02:41,465 --> 01:02:45,135
We're tryin' to track him, sir.
We're working hard.

732
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:49,556
We cannot let him do this.

733
01:02:49,641 --> 01:02:51,934
You know I agree, sir.

734
01:02:52,018 --> 01:02:54,353
This is now
a national security matter.

735
01:02:54,438 --> 01:02:56,313
Seize and secure
Worthington Labs.

736
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:59,030
I want troops armed with cure
weapons deployed immediately.

737
01:02:59,030 --> 01:02:59,682
Yes, sir.

738
01:02:59,985 --> 01:03:00,958
And, Trask,

739
01:03:01,144 --> 01:03:03,391
you have to find Magneto
and stop him,

740
01:03:03,737 --> 01:03:06,282
by any means necessary.

741
01:03:06,364 --> 01:03:09,577
Magneto wants a war.
We'll give him one.

742
01:03:09,661 --> 01:03:12,454
Let's go! Keep it movin'!

743
01:03:12,539 --> 01:03:16,041
Turn in your old weapon.
Turn in all metal...

744
01:03:16,126 --> 01:03:19,710
bayonets, magazines, dog tags.

745
01:03:19,795 --> 01:03:22,213
Pick up your plastic weapons.

746
01:03:22,297 --> 01:03:26,177
Pick up your cure cartridge.
Absolutely no metal.

747
01:03:36,271 --> 01:03:40,815
We don't need a cure.
We don't need a cure.

748
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,710
Members of the Brotherhood--

749
01:06:10,257 --> 01:06:12,300
They wish to cure us.

750
01:06:12,385 --> 01:06:15,429
But I say to you,
we are the cure!

751
01:06:18,681 --> 01:06:21,684
The cure for their infirm,
imperfect condition called...

752
01:06:21,768 --> 01:06:23,728
Homo sapiens.

753
01:06:25,773 --> 01:06:28,858
They have their weapons.

754
01:06:28,943 --> 01:06:30,902
We have ours.

755
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:36,407
We will strike
with a vengeance and a fury...

756
01:06:36,492 --> 01:06:39,411
that this world
has never witnessed.

757
01:06:41,289 --> 01:06:44,278
And if any mutants
stand in our way,

758
01:06:44,278 --> 01:06:46,867
we will use this poison
against them.

759
01:06:47,170 --> 01:06:50,505
We shall go to
Alcatraz Island,

760
01:06:50,590 --> 01:06:52,800
take control of the cure...

761
01:06:52,884 --> 01:06:55,510
and destroy its source.

762
01:06:55,594 --> 01:06:59,681
And then,
nothing can stop us!

763
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:16,114
Jean?

764
01:07:28,581 --> 01:07:30,536
l know the smell
of your adamantium

765
01:07:30,536 --> 01:07:32,123
from a mile away.

766
01:07:32,159 --> 01:07:33,882
I didn't come here
to fight you.

767
01:07:33,967 --> 01:07:36,342
- Smart boy.
- I came for Jean.

768
01:07:36,427 --> 01:07:38,637
You think I'm keeping her
against her will?

769
01:07:49,398 --> 01:07:51,442
She's here because
she wants to be.

770
01:07:51,568 --> 01:07:53,063
You don't know
what you're dealing with.

771
01:07:53,414 --> 01:07:54,755
I know full well.

772
01:07:54,789 --> 01:07:56,905
I saw what
she did to Charles.

773
01:07:56,989 --> 01:08:00,492
And you just stood there
and let him die?

774
01:08:00,577 --> 01:08:02,452
I'm not leaving here
without her.

775
01:08:02,536 --> 01:08:04,538
Yes, you are.

776
01:08:06,039 --> 01:08:08,458
Whoa--

777
01:08:17,635 --> 01:08:20,554
Okay.

778
01:08:20,636 --> 01:08:22,765
Two minutes to rendezvous,
Mr. President.

779
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:28,979
We have a satellite feed
of Magneto's base of operations.

780
01:08:32,524 --> 01:08:33,599
How did we find it?

781
01:08:34,429 --> 01:08:36,296
She gave us everything
we wanted and more.

782
01:08:38,698 --> 01:08:41,573
Hell hath no fury
like a woman scorned.

783
01:09:16,694 --> 01:09:18,904
Approaching target dead ahead.

784
01:09:20,404 --> 01:09:22,908
Set for 360-degree incursion.

785
01:09:35,296 --> 01:09:36,824
This is Team Leader
to Bravo One.

786
01:09:37,149 --> 01:09:38,601
We are green to go.

787
01:09:42,679 --> 01:09:45,720
Okay.
Send them in.

788
01:09:45,805 --> 01:09:47,015
Okay.

789
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:49,225
Freeze, mutants!
Get your hands in the air!

790
01:10:05,993 --> 01:10:09,621
Okay. I give up.

791
01:10:09,706 --> 01:10:12,038
Sorry, Mr. Secretary.
lt was a decoy.

792
01:10:12,125 --> 01:10:15,127
If he's not there,
then where the hell is he?

793
01:10:23,469 --> 01:10:27,514
Worthington Labs.
It ends where it began.

794
01:10:27,599 --> 01:10:29,515
Are you sure
the boy's still inside?

795
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:30,761
100%.

796
01:10:30,953 --> 01:10:32,423
So how we
supposed to get there?

797
01:10:33,292 --> 01:10:34,529
'Cause I don't swim.

798
01:10:34,854 --> 01:10:37,149
Leave that to me.

799
01:10:42,654 --> 01:10:45,908
Storm? Storm?

800
01:10:45,992 --> 01:10:48,783
What are you doing
back here?

801
01:10:48,868 --> 01:10:50,828
I need help.

802
01:10:50,953 --> 01:10:53,707
- You found her. - Yeah.
She's with Magneto.

803
01:10:53,832 --> 01:10:55,832
- Where are they?
- They're on the move.

804
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:56,784
I know where they're going.

805
01:10:56,784 --> 01:10:58,154
You're saying
you saw Magneto?

806
01:10:58,296 --> 01:10:59,474
Yeah. Gotta go now.

807
01:10:59,613 --> 01:11:01,149
They're going to
attack Alcatraz.

808
01:11:01,591 --> 01:11:03,800
There are troops
stationed on that island.

809
01:11:03,885 --> 01:11:05,217
Not enough to stop him.

810
01:11:05,733 --> 01:11:06,673
Let's suit up.

811
01:11:11,768 --> 01:11:13,685
I don't believe
this once fit me.

812
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:15,112
If Magneto gets ahold
of that cure,

813
01:11:15,112 --> 01:11:16,331
there will be no
stopping him.

814
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:17,753
Can you estimate
how many he has?

815
01:11:17,753 --> 01:11:19,429
An army...
And Jean.

816
01:11:19,429 --> 01:11:21,399
His powers have limits,
hers do not.

817
01:11:21,484 --> 01:11:23,528
There's only
six of us, Logan.

818
01:11:26,614 --> 01:11:30,577
Yeah. We're outnumbered.
I'm not gonna lie to you.

819
01:11:31,871 --> 01:11:35,413
But we lost Scott.
We lost the professor.

820
01:11:36,113 --> 01:11:38,501
lf we don't fight now,
everything they stood for

821
01:11:38,501 --> 01:11:39,520
will die with them.

822
01:11:41,506 --> 01:11:44,172
I'm not gonna
let that happen.

823
01:11:44,256 --> 01:11:46,259
Are you?

824
01:11:47,636 --> 01:11:49,595
Then we stand together,

825
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:54,393
X-Men, all of us.

826
01:12:02,158 --> 01:12:02,957
We're in.

827
01:12:04,573 --> 01:12:05,447
Let's go.

828
01:12:10,533 --> 01:12:12,452
They're ready.

829
01:12:12,537 --> 01:12:15,537
Yeah, I know.
But are you ready...

830
01:12:15,622 --> 01:12:18,457
to do what you need to do
when the time comes?

831
01:13:47,046 --> 01:13:49,716
Dad, what's going on?

832
01:13:50,841 --> 01:13:53,676
It's an earthquake.

833
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:58,975
We're trapped!

834
01:14:53,904 --> 01:14:55,864
Cheese--

835
01:16:02,225 --> 01:16:06,019
Charles always wanted
to build bridges.

836
01:16:20,743 --> 01:16:23,453
My God!

837
01:16:48,060 --> 01:16:51,648
Fall back!
Take cover! Fall back!

838
01:17:06,412 --> 01:17:08,734
The boy's in the southeast
corner of the building.

839
01:17:11,046 --> 01:17:11,936
Well done.

840
01:17:12,211 --> 01:17:15,380
Let's take it down!

841
01:17:31,229 --> 01:17:34,024
In chess,
the pawns go first.

842
01:17:36,609 --> 01:17:39,237
Humans and their guns.

843
01:17:48,078 --> 01:17:50,913
Plastic.
They've learned.

844
01:17:57,087 --> 01:17:59,922
That's why the pawns go first.

845
01:18:08,768 --> 01:18:10,435
Target the bridge!

846
01:18:10,519 --> 01:18:12,145
Bring out the launcher!

847
01:18:12,229 --> 01:18:14,939
- This is it!
- Ready! Load!

848
01:18:18,734 --> 01:18:20,612
Fire!

849
01:18:27,368 --> 01:18:29,787
Arclight,
use your shock waves!

850
01:18:29,872 --> 01:18:32,247
Target those weapons!

851
01:18:51,475 --> 01:18:54,060
Oh, my stars and garters.

852
01:18:54,145 --> 01:18:56,145
Goin' to stealth mode.

853
01:18:57,689 --> 01:19:00,068
What about jets, tanks?

854
01:19:00,152 --> 01:19:02,694
Against Magneto?
He'll turn 'em inside out.

855
01:19:02,779 --> 01:19:06,489
- Where are our ground troops?
- Thirty minutes away.

856
01:19:06,573 --> 01:19:09,452
Then God help us.

857
01:19:18,712 --> 01:19:20,962
They're coming for him.

858
01:19:23,759 --> 01:19:25,426
Get the humans!

859
01:19:51,871 --> 01:19:53,912
Whoa!

860
01:19:55,122 --> 01:19:57,041
Don't ever
do that again.

861
01:20:03,881 --> 01:20:08,051
You men, cover the doors!
Everybody, get together!

862
01:20:08,136 --> 01:20:10,720
And hold this line!

863
01:20:24,653 --> 01:20:28,198
Traitors to their own cause.

864
01:20:34,328 --> 01:20:37,038
Finish them!

865
01:21:12,201 --> 01:21:13,908
Not yet.

866
01:21:28,634 --> 01:21:31,386
Go inside,
get the boy and kill him.

867
01:21:31,470 --> 01:21:33,429
With pleasure.

868
01:21:39,353 --> 01:21:42,020
Hold it!

869
01:21:43,899 --> 01:21:47,149
- He's going for the boy!
- Not if I get there first!

870
01:21:48,153 --> 01:21:49,654
Kitty!

871
01:22:00,791 --> 01:22:03,542
Come on!

872
01:22:06,005 --> 01:22:08,006
Grow those back.

873
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:20,850
Don't you know who I am?

874
01:22:22,104 --> 01:22:24,229
I'm the Juggernaut, bitch!

875
01:22:55,304 --> 01:22:57,220
Going somewhere?

876
01:23:01,185 --> 01:23:03,603
You're the guy that
invented the cure, right?

877
01:23:03,685 --> 01:23:05,895
Yes, I am.

878
01:23:07,358 --> 01:23:09,108
Girls?

879
01:23:09,193 --> 01:23:11,234
No! Don't!
Don't hurt him!

880
01:23:11,319 --> 01:23:14,863
- No! Don't hurt him!
- Let go of me! l didn't do anything.

881
01:23:14,948 --> 01:23:16,573
Calm down.
Calm down.

882
01:23:16,658 --> 01:23:19,283
Everything's
gonna be okay.

883
01:23:37,054 --> 01:23:38,970
I thought
you were a diplomat.

884
01:23:39,055 --> 01:23:41,806
As Churchill said, "There comes
a time when all men must--"

885
01:23:43,100 --> 01:23:45,060
Oh, you get the point!

886
01:23:46,354 --> 01:23:50,817
Oh, no! No. Please!
No, no, don't! No!

887
01:23:56,988 --> 01:23:58,882
No, don't worry.
I'm here to help you.

888
01:23:59,202 --> 01:24:00,376
I'm gonna get you out of here.

889
01:24:01,828 --> 01:24:04,078
This way.

890
01:24:05,332 --> 01:24:07,250
Oh, my God.
What's going on?

891
01:24:07,332 --> 01:24:09,542
Your powers
won't work with me.

892
01:24:13,841 --> 01:24:16,591
- Stay close,
all right? - Okay.

893
01:24:19,304 --> 01:24:22,265
I'm the wrong guy to play
hide-and-seek with.

894
01:24:22,349 --> 01:24:25,975
Who's hiding, dickhead?

895
01:24:36,319 --> 01:24:40,867
Don't!
No! Don't! D--

896
01:24:40,951 --> 01:24:42,398
Please, don't do this!

897
01:24:42,774 --> 01:24:44,372
I only wanted to help
you people.

898
01:24:44,912 --> 01:24:47,457
Do we look like
we need your help?

899
01:25:17,944 --> 01:25:20,363
It's time to end this war.

900
01:25:31,024 --> 01:25:31,942
Take cover!

901
01:25:35,087 --> 01:25:37,215
Get out of the way!

902
01:25:47,725 --> 01:25:49,393
Come on! Let's go!

903
01:25:52,481 --> 01:25:54,108
Go! Go! Go!

904
01:26:42,238 --> 01:26:44,154
We work as a team.

905
01:26:45,492 --> 01:26:46,974
Best defense
is a good offense.

906
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:51,841
Run!

907
01:26:54,376 --> 01:26:56,961
Bobby! You think you can
take out your old friend?

908
01:27:10,309 --> 01:27:12,225
Go ahead.

909
01:27:13,729 --> 01:27:15,729
Storm, we're gonna
need some cover.

910
01:27:16,493 --> 01:27:17,054
Right.

911
01:28:07,329 --> 01:28:08,672
You're in over
your head, Bobby.

912
01:28:10,595 --> 01:28:12,333
Maybe you should
go back to school.

913
01:28:24,064 --> 01:28:25,305
You never should've left.

914
01:28:27,511 --> 01:28:29,720
This is it.

915
01:28:29,805 --> 01:28:33,555
Hey. Make it a strike.

916
01:28:45,529 --> 01:28:48,072
You never learn, do you?

917
01:28:49,739 --> 01:28:53,202
Actually, I do.

918
01:29:05,966 --> 01:29:08,676
I'm--

919
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:10,761
One of them?

920
01:29:21,793 --> 01:29:25,943
This is what they
want for all of us.

921
01:29:45,962 --> 01:29:47,965
It's over, Jean.

922
01:29:50,510 --> 01:29:52,470
It's over.

923
01:29:55,680 --> 01:29:57,640
No! Don't shoot!

924
01:30:11,198 --> 01:30:13,532
No!

925
01:30:14,868 --> 01:30:17,161
No--

926
01:30:29,591 --> 01:30:32,676
Everybody, get out of here!

927
01:30:41,185 --> 01:30:43,185
Bobby!

928
01:30:53,448 --> 01:30:55,448
What have I done?

929
01:31:06,569 --> 01:31:08,127
I'm the only one
who can stop her.

930
01:31:08,212 --> 01:31:11,215
Get everyone
to safety. Go!

931
01:31:16,567 --> 01:31:17,967
Jean!

932
01:32:03,894 --> 01:32:04,640
Jean,

933
01:32:05,983 --> 01:32:07,259
I know you're still there!

934
01:32:54,319 --> 01:32:56,528
You would die for them?

935
01:32:58,698 --> 01:33:00,658
No. Not for them.

936
01:33:01,993 --> 01:33:04,161
For you.

937
01:33:05,828 --> 01:33:07,831
For you.

938
01:33:12,877 --> 01:33:14,880
Save me.

939
01:33:16,726 --> 01:33:18,175
I love you.

940
01:33:51,649 --> 01:33:53,567
No!

941
01:34:57,744 --> 01:34:58,730
You're back.

942
01:35:06,826 --> 01:35:09,328
I'm sorry.

943
01:35:09,412 --> 01:35:11,372
I had to.

944
01:35:12,301 --> 01:35:13,872
This isn't
what I wanted.

945
01:35:13,957 --> 01:35:15,917
I know.

946
01:35:16,002 --> 01:35:17,961
It's what I wanted.

947
01:35:27,514 --> 01:35:29,971
Don't worry, Dad.
l'll call.

948
01:35:31,140 --> 01:35:33,143
Hey.

949
01:35:33,228 --> 01:35:35,185
Good to
see you, buddy.

950
01:35:35,270 --> 01:35:38,939
And so it is with the thanks
of a grateful nation...

951
01:35:39,024 --> 01:35:40,972
that I introduce
our new ambassador

952
01:35:40,972 --> 01:35:42,399
to the United Nations...

953
01:35:42,399 --> 01:35:44,279
and the representative
to the world...

954
01:35:44,363 --> 01:35:49,408
for all United States citizens,
human and mutant alike--

955
01:35:49,536 --> 01:35:51,993
Dr. Hank McCoy.

956
01:35:54,632 --> 01:35:56,917
Way to go, furball.

957
01:35:57,837 --> 01:36:00,502
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

958
01:43:45,551 --> 01:43:47,636
Good morning.

959
01:43:52,143 --> 01:43:54,100
Hello, Moira.

960
01:44:00,734 --> 01:44:02,819
Charles?
