1
00:01:21,215 --> 00:01:22,545
One

2
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:24,015
between the eyes!

3
00:01:24,051 --> 00:01:26,177
Two

4
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:28,313
between the eyes.

5
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:59,081
- Out!
- What?

6
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:04,423
- She was safe.
- She was out.

7
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,391
She landed right there.
She's safe.

8
00:02:09,028 --> 00:02:10,689
Turk: Aw, come on.

9
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:13,393
Umpire: That's enough.
I don't want to hear another word.

10
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:15,698
- You're gone!
- Yeah, I'm gone.

11
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:26,235
My grandmother used to take me
to Washington Square Park...

12
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:30,550
to watch Bobby Fischer
play 10 games at the same time.

13
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:32,643
Queen me.

14
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:35,621
He was five-six moves ahead
on each table.

15
00:02:36,622 --> 00:02:39,114
Anyway, he became
the world champ, didn't he?

16
00:02:39,158 --> 00:02:41,183
Then he lost his fucking mind.

17
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:47,159
He became a raving paranoid.

18
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,930
Being attacked
from all directions,

19
00:02:48,968 --> 00:02:50,993
he couldn't see
what was in front of him.

20
00:02:58,111 --> 00:03:00,306
Mate. Mate!

21
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:22,794
(both laugh)

22
00:03:30,676 --> 00:03:33,201
My name is David Fisk,

23
00:03:33,247 --> 00:03:35,408
Detective First Grade.

24
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:39,484
I've been a cop in the NYPD
for over 30 years.

25
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,152
In that time...

26
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:47,225
I've killed 14 people.

27
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:51,120
Man: Run that by me
one more time.

28
00:03:52,132 --> 00:03:54,692
I've killed 14 people.

29
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:56,396
He's nuts.

30
00:03:58,872 --> 00:04:01,102
Turk's voice: When did
these things start?

31
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:07,372
How did they start?

32
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:15,751
Maybe this one started
with a guy named Charles Randall.

33
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,295
Randall was a child killer.

34
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:28,432
He killed his girlfriend's daughter

35
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:30,903
about four years ago.

36
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:34,264
Randall: Fuck you, damn asshole.

37
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:37,168
Turk's voice: He was tried
for the crime,

38
00:04:37,211 --> 00:04:39,678
but was acquitted
by a jury of his peers.

39
00:04:54,194 --> 00:04:57,322
My partner and I
found this unacceptable.

40
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,069
My partner is a good man.

41
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:27,685
Are you really
gonna do this thing?

42
00:05:27,728 --> 00:05:29,752
Do what?

43
00:05:29,795 --> 00:05:32,230
You're going to
take down Randall

44
00:05:32,266 --> 00:05:34,427
for a homicide
he didn't commit.

45
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:41,637
What am I gonna do?

46
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,665
You're my partner.

47
00:05:43,709 --> 00:05:46,110
- You're my role model.
- Right.

48
00:05:46,146 --> 00:05:48,137
What am I gonna do
without a role model?

49
00:05:51,552 --> 00:05:54,350
We didn't have
this conversation.

50
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:56,879
What conversation?

51
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:17,771
Turk's voice: It got done.

52
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:25,108
Randall lost his freedom

53
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:27,120
for the crime he didn't commit.

54
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:35,052
Turk's voice: I lost my faith.

55
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,255
- I'm gonna go.
- Okay.

56
00:06:50,177 --> 00:06:53,312
You can take this
as a confession if you want.

57
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:55,338
Whatever.

58
00:06:55,382 --> 00:06:58,180
A few weeks ago
things heated up.

59
00:06:58,218 --> 00:06:59,980
What do we got on him, Turk?

60
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:04,423
Marcus Smith, AKA Spider...
big big dope deals,

61
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,891
murders, extortion,
lots of nice things.

62
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:09,259
He converted
this old abandoned bank

63
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:11,423
into Club 404 of Harlem.

64
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:13,091
Maybe when he sees us
he'll confess.

65
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:15,100
What, you don't believe
in miracles?

66
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:16,726
When you pick up a check
one day...

67
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,101
one day,
then I'll believe in miracles.

68
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:22,266
- Let's go. I'm buying.
- Yeah, that's a miracle I want to see.

69
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:25,141
(crowd chattering,
distant music playing)

70
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:28,939
(hip-hop music playing)
#We fly high, no lie #

71
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:31,951
#You hear that?
You know this, balling #

72
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:34,954
#Foreign rides outside #

73
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:37,047
#It's like showbiz,
we in the building #

74
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:39,284
#We stay fly, no lie... #

75
00:07:39,326 --> 00:07:41,088
Turk: This is where he launders
his money.

76
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:45,086
Rooster: Oh, yeah,
cleaning green green green.

77
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:47,326
Turk: He's all business.

78
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,566
I gotta take a leak.

79
00:08:00,312 --> 00:08:02,473
Oh, I'll just be a sec.

80
00:08:02,516 --> 00:08:03,983
I'm not peeking.

81
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:06,416
No problem.

82
00:08:10,956 --> 00:08:13,481
- You guys are so lucky.
- Why is that?

83
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:15,824
No line to the bathroom and...

84
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:17,726
(sniffs)

85
00:08:17,764 --> 00:08:19,994
You get to pee standing up.

86
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:21,863
Unzip, psss, zip.

87
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:24,165
Badda boom badda bing,
you're out of here.

88
00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:28,606
Yeah, the big guy really outdid himself
on this thing.

89
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:30,007
You want a bump?

90
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:31,976
Where did you get that from?

91
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,446
Spider. Supremo.

92
00:08:38,652 --> 00:08:41,086
(train whistle blows)

93
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:05,634
(door closes)

94
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,582
(muffled screams)

95
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:23,118
(crash, thumping)

96
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:37,866
(sighs)

97
00:09:42,883 --> 00:09:44,874
Not bad.

98
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:48,182
Turk: Not bad?
What the fuck were you looking for?

99
00:09:48,221 --> 00:09:50,620
Come on, Turk,

100
00:09:50,657 --> 00:09:52,648
you pulled my hair.

101
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:55,889
Gee, my little sister used to
pull my hair harder than that.

102
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,123
Whatever.

103
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:03,394
I gotta go.

104
00:10:14,548 --> 00:10:16,846
- Where the fuck are you going?
- I'm tired.

105
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:19,544
You're tired?
It's America, you whiny bitch.

106
00:10:19,586 --> 00:10:22,418
Why don't you fucking get in the cab
and do some honest work?

107
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:25,322
Yeah, she's on her way.
She can't wait to see you.

108
00:10:25,357 --> 00:10:28,623
Rambo the Skateboard Pimp
was my 10th kill.

109
00:10:30,764 --> 00:10:34,461
- (muffled gunshot)
- Think of me as a street-sweeper.

110
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,594
I cleaned up this worthless
piece of shit

111
00:10:36,635 --> 00:10:39,662
and left an obituary of sorts.
It rhymes.

112
00:10:48,548 --> 00:10:50,913
Rooster, we gotta find out
who did this.

113
00:10:50,951 --> 00:10:52,816
Give him a medal.

114
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:55,686
Hey, Rambo, you see
who did this?

115
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:57,690
He ain't talking, eh?

116
00:10:57,724 --> 00:10:59,918
Real name Robert Brady.

117
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,951
Bobby Brady. Damn shame.

118
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:03,826
What are you thinking?
Marcia? Greg?

119
00:11:03,864 --> 00:11:05,297
(both chuckle)

120
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,322
You guys messing up
my crime scene again?

121
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:09,494
You don't know
who Bobby Brady is?

122
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:11,527
Yeah, we met about an hour ago.

123
00:11:11,571 --> 00:11:14,335
- It looks like close range.
- From the stippling around the wound

124
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:16,000
I'd say two to three feet away.

125
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:18,772
We'll be fishing fragments
out of his brains.

126
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:20,870
- What?
- No, I just got that...

127
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:23,006
"Marcia? Greg?"
That's a good one, Rooster.

128
00:11:23,048 --> 00:11:24,778
Well, that was quick.

129
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:26,649
Just trying to keep pace with you.

130
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:33,951
Turk: "He trades in sin,
distributes flesh.

131
00:11:33,994 --> 00:11:36,360
He picks the fruit
when it is fresh.

132
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:39,524
Now someone else
must slap his whore.

133
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:44,298
His heart has stopped.
He breathes no more."

134
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:48,197
What do you want to do
about this?

135
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,038
I say let's make the best of it,

136
00:11:51,076 --> 00:11:54,205
canvass the hookers.
Maybe we'll meet one you like.

137
00:11:54,246 --> 00:11:57,875
Please. I got all I can handle
from you-know-who.

138
00:11:57,918 --> 00:11:59,715
No shit?

139
00:11:59,753 --> 00:12:02,846
She's got my sperm level so low
I gotta sit down to take a piss.

140
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,549
Oh, thanks for that picture.

141
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:06,855
- Hey, what can I tell you?
- (laughs)

142
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:09,657
(Russian accent)
How can I help you, gentlemen?

143
00:12:09,696 --> 00:12:11,721
We'd like to talk to you
about your boss.

144
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:14,028
He's upstairs.

145
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:16,399
No, your other boss.

146
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:22,197
Rambo.

147
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,176
He is asshole.

148
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:27,373
Why "he is asshole"?

149
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,813
Follow me, please.

150
00:12:34,586 --> 00:12:36,213
You know anybody
who'd want to kill him?

151
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,917
Me.

152
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:39,254
Anyone else?

153
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:41,283
Why? He's dead?

154
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:42,989
(chuckles)

155
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:45,553
Hey, listen, you want to smarten up
and help us out

156
00:12:45,597 --> 00:12:47,293
or am I gonna have to call
somebody at ICE

157
00:12:47,334 --> 00:12:49,096
and have you on the next plane
to kielbasa-land?

158
00:12:49,134 --> 00:12:50,966
Go ahead.

159
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:52,903
I am American citizen.

160
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,998
Yeah.

161
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,100
Lick my balls anytime.

162
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:58,735
What?

163
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,769
Call us anytime, you know,

164
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:03,214
if you hear something, anything.

165
00:13:05,585 --> 00:13:08,418
Rooster: I think we're looking
for a guy named Sam the Butcher.

166
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:10,923
- Who?
- (laughs)

167
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:13,221
Nah, he's kidding around.
But seriously, Lieutenant,

168
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:15,283
how far do you want us to go
with this Rambo murder?

169
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:17,796
I don't know, I was thinking maybe
you could investigate it a bit more,

170
00:13:17,831 --> 00:13:20,230
figure out who did it,
try to put him in jail.

171
00:13:20,265 --> 00:13:23,133
That is, if it doesn't get in the way
of your shuffleboard lessons.

172
00:13:23,168 --> 00:13:24,692
Yeah, no problem.

173
00:13:24,738 --> 00:13:27,605
We're also working this dealer Spider
who's tied to these two stiffs

174
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:28,937
we found on Fresh Kills.

175
00:13:32,245 --> 00:13:35,145
If we can nail him, who knows
how far up the ladder it will lead?

176
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:36,307
So what about it?

177
00:13:36,349 --> 00:13:38,043
I popped this lawyer
with an ounce of blow.

178
00:13:38,084 --> 00:13:40,450
She practically shoved it up my nose.
I got her to flip on him.

179
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,148
Lucky fuck, eh?

180
00:13:42,187 --> 00:13:43,815
She scored it from him directly?

181
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:46,154
- Yeah, she did.
- Good.

182
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:49,889
Okay, well, get what you can out of her
and kick her loose.

183
00:13:49,928 --> 00:13:52,365
I hate trying to prosecute
fucking lawyers.

184
00:13:52,365 --> 00:13:55,197
(trains passing)

185
00:14:01,106 --> 00:14:03,336
- This isn't Spider's club.
- The back way in.

186
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:07,403
Rooster: Yeah, it's an abandoned
linen factory, Jessica.

187
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:10,381
I guess I'm not your average...

188
00:14:10,417 --> 00:14:11,907
what do you call it?

189
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:13,942
- Rat?
- Stoolie?

190
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:15,977
Thanks.

191
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:19,719
I mean, I think usually
it's some poor African-American kid

192
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:21,989
or a junkie or a prostitute.

193
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:24,587
Well, normally 200-grand-a-year
corporate lawyers

194
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:27,566
are much smarter than your average
African-American junkie whore...

195
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,227
normally, but sometimes
they only think they are.

196
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:33,136
Man over radio: It's all set
on this end.

197
00:14:33,173 --> 00:14:34,834
Are you guys sure
it's safe in there?

198
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,933
Man: You tell your girlfriend
to grow a pair and let's go.

199
00:14:37,976 --> 00:14:41,037
What do you say, Counsel?
Are you ready to do this thing?

200
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:43,743
Yeah, let's get it over with.

201
00:14:43,783 --> 00:14:46,751
Okay, remember what we said?
You go in there,

202
00:14:46,786 --> 00:14:50,187
you wait for him to ask you
for what you need, right?

203
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:52,850
And then you don't come back here
with less than four ounces.

204
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,359
- Four ounces?
- Yeah.

205
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:57,056
Isn't that a lot? I, like, buy a couple
of balls at the club, that's it.

206
00:14:57,096 --> 00:15:00,066
You just say you're going skiing and
you need a week's worth of fresh powder.

207
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,432
Yeah, you tell him you're going
on vacation.

208
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:09,068
I do this thing
and my record's wiped clean?

209
00:15:09,109 --> 00:15:10,405
As a whistle.

210
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:12,410
No one at my law firm will know
that I got busted, right?

211
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:13,969
It never happened.

212
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:17,379
Look, Counsel, we all know you
better than this.

213
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:20,010
You just do this, you stop
shoving that shit up your nose,

214
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:21,816
you go home, you get married,
you have kids,

215
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:24,517
you never come back here,
and that's that.

216
00:15:26,024 --> 00:15:28,356
Yeah.

217
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:31,226
Officer: Everybody's in position.

218
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:33,731
- Turk: Okay, we're going.
- Officer: Yes, sir.

219
00:15:36,034 --> 00:15:38,697
Officer: Let's push the signal
back 50%.

220
00:15:39,706 --> 00:15:41,730
Rooster: Hey, Jessica.

221
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,240
Break a leg.

222
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,937
(radio chatter)

223
00:15:45,979 --> 00:15:47,970
It's two flights down.

224
00:15:48,014 --> 00:15:50,379
The door's on the left.
Ring the bell.

225
00:15:55,855 --> 00:15:57,379
(rings doorbell)

226
00:15:57,423 --> 00:15:59,890
Hey, Stubby, why don't you
go and escort our company up here?

227
00:16:01,693 --> 00:16:03,719
Go on, fat boy.

228
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,124
Get it on.

229
00:16:16,743 --> 00:16:19,438
- Good afternoon.
- Hey, Spider.

230
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,970
- I'll be downstairs.
- All right.

231
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:24,039
- How are you?
- All right, baby,

232
00:16:24,082 --> 00:16:26,448
just checking out this wizard shit
before I let my kids watch it.

233
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,953
- You seen this?
- No.

234
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,456
The guy is a stone dealer.
I let my little ones watch this...

235
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,754
they'll all turn out junkies.
You know what I'm saying?

236
00:16:33,793 --> 00:16:35,283
He's got a point.

237
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,523
- You remember Underdog?
- What about him?

238
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:40,499
That fucking dog spawned
a generation of junkies.

239
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:44,366
So you converted the bank
into a club and a recording studio?

240
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:46,963
- Yeah. You like it?
- Yeah.

241
00:16:47,005 --> 00:16:48,905
What are you talking about?

242
00:16:48,942 --> 00:16:50,671
What did Underdog do
all the time?

243
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:52,404
He was always shining shoes

244
00:16:52,445 --> 00:16:54,605
and whenever Sweet Polly Purebred
would call out to him,

245
00:16:54,647 --> 00:16:56,615
his dog ears would pick it up
and he'd rescue her.

246
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:59,116
Yeah, but what did he do
when he needed his super strength?

247
00:16:59,152 --> 00:17:01,312
He'd go to his ring, remember?

248
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:03,219
Pull out a pill, pop it.

249
00:17:03,255 --> 00:17:06,748
Holy shit, you're right.
He was a little fucking speed freak.

250
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:08,124
Spider: So what's the business?

251
00:17:08,161 --> 00:17:10,993
How about a QP?
You're good for a QP.

252
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:12,691
The fuck you want with QP?

253
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:15,359
I'm going skiing with friends,

254
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:17,961
a lot of friends.

255
00:17:18,003 --> 00:17:20,438
- Where?
- Aspen, Colorado.

256
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:23,202
Shit. I'm sure you can
score one in Aspen.

257
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:25,233
Not your primo brand.

258
00:17:26,246 --> 00:17:27,679
You ski?

259
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,203
Sure. My whole life.

260
00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:32,376
Come on, I don't have all day.

261
00:17:32,417 --> 00:17:34,750
Why don't you put down your jacket,
stay a little while?

262
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:35,980
What do you think?

263
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:37,579
Jessica: Actually,
I've got to run.

264
00:17:37,624 --> 00:17:41,526
I have a major IPO
closing in an hour, so...

265
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,290
You know, stress will kill you.
You gotta chill out.

266
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:47,598
I'm as chill as I get.

267
00:17:47,634 --> 00:17:49,625
What do you want to do?

268
00:17:52,971 --> 00:17:55,372
You know, every once in a while...

269
00:17:57,542 --> 00:17:59,602
one of you Upper East Side bitches
gets popped,

270
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:01,636
tries to to roll over
on a nigga like me.

271
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:03,773
You're scared now.

272
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:06,979
(doorbell ringing)

273
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:11,047
Looks like the cavalry
come to rescue you.

274
00:18:11,089 --> 00:18:12,579
Can I help you, gentlemen?

275
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,057
Yeah, let us in, Spider.

276
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,288
I'm sorry, there's no one here
by that name.

277
00:18:16,328 --> 00:18:19,230
- Let us in.
- We only want to talk to you.

278
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:21,893
(door buzzes)

279
00:18:21,933 --> 00:18:24,835
See, I know how to look
and I know where to look.

280
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:32,744
Come to papa.

281
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:36,107
It always hurts the first time.

282
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:38,747
Turk: You all right?

283
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:40,582
Why wouldn't she be all right?
We're watching TV.

284
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,280
How the fuck is she gonna get hurt
watching TV?

285
00:18:42,322 --> 00:18:44,915
She could have seen or heard
something that scared her.

286
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,856
- Like what?
- Like some big fucking mutt

287
00:18:46,893 --> 00:18:48,416
shooting his bug fat
fucking mouth off.

288
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:51,327
Wasn't nobody here fitting that description
till a minute ago.

289
00:18:51,364 --> 00:18:53,263
I'm gonna show you ugly,
you fucking mother...

290
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:55,767
- We've said enough.
- Oh, you wanna bring your wife up in here?

291
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,862
That's it. That's it.
Let's go. It's okay.

292
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:01,634
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay.

293
00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:03,642
You want your wire back?

294
00:19:05,243 --> 00:19:07,108
Firearm!

295
00:19:07,145 --> 00:19:08,238
No, Stubby, no!

296
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:18,854
Get down.
Get the fuck down!

297
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:30,101
Turk: Come on.

298
00:19:30,135 --> 00:19:32,933
The fat one's dead.

299
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:37,137
(Jessica moaning)

300
00:19:42,048 --> 00:19:43,447
Well, that went well.

301
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:47,218
Oh, shit, you're bleeding.

302
00:19:48,221 --> 00:19:51,315
3-4 squad, Central.
11-41, request ambulance.

303
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:54,154
I need EMS. Subject shot,
184th and St. Nicholas.

304
00:19:54,192 --> 00:19:56,387
Really, I tried my best.

305
00:19:56,429 --> 00:19:59,728
You're doing just fine, Counsel.
You're doing just fine. Just relax.

306
00:19:59,766 --> 00:20:02,859
Hey, guys, if you ever
need a lawyer...

307
00:20:02,902 --> 00:20:05,632
Yeah, okay.

308
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:08,138
You bet.

309
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,106
In good old days
we used to

310
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:15,875
let the perp bleed out
and call off the ambulance.

311
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:17,848
- Calm calm calm.
- Fucking lowlife.

312
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:19,681
You made your point.
You made your point.

313
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:22,017
Tough little bitch, ain't you,
kicking a man while he's handcuffed?

314
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,545
Shut the fuck up,
you piece of shit.

315
00:20:24,589 --> 00:20:26,217
You think I won't blow
your fucking head off?

316
00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:28,021
I wouldn't think twice
about it.

317
00:20:28,059 --> 00:20:30,324
I'd go in there,
get the fat boy's gun,

318
00:20:30,363 --> 00:20:34,026
come back here
and put two between your eyes.

319
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,000
(rapid footsteps)

320
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:40,828
Where's EMS?

321
00:20:40,873 --> 00:20:44,069
Woman: This thing was a clusterfuck
to end all clusterfucks.

322
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:45,667
You got nothing.

323
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:47,679
How about felony murder?

324
00:20:47,712 --> 00:20:50,203
No drugs, right?
So no predicate felony,

325
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,148
no conspiracy,
no nothing.

326
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:54,210
No felony. No felony.
I can't believe this.

327
00:20:54,252 --> 00:20:55,981
No felony.
How do you spell felony?

328
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:59,355
Homicide, racketeering, drugs...
I mean, what are we talking about?

329
00:20:59,392 --> 00:21:02,019
Hey, you're lucky
that white girl didn't die.

330
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,961
IAB is gonna interview
both of you

331
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:06,463
and do a preliminary report
over the next couple of weeks.

332
00:21:06,499 --> 00:21:09,990
Now off the record
you actually didn't violate procedure

333
00:21:10,036 --> 00:21:12,470
because the victim had a firearm
aimed at you,

334
00:21:12,505 --> 00:21:14,734
so if you stick together
you should make it through this.

335
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:16,765
Lieutenant: You'd better get
your story straight too,

336
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:19,642
'cause I'm not going back to Far Rockaway
because you two fucked up.

337
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,272
And you're gonna spend some couch time
with the rubber-gun squad.

338
00:21:22,315 --> 00:21:26,115
And you'd better take this shrink seriously
or you'll be off active duty.

339
00:21:26,152 --> 00:21:27,914
That fucking piece of shit
just walks.

340
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,750
Knock it off, Turk.

341
00:21:32,258 --> 00:21:34,885
Relax, partner.
He's gonna get his.

342
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:37,451
Man: Gentlemen, your questions.

343
00:21:37,497 --> 00:21:39,896
- Who made the decision to enter?
- I did.

344
00:21:39,932 --> 00:21:41,923
- Whose decision was it to enter?
- Mine.

345
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:44,266
Did you immediately identify yourselves
as police officers?

346
00:21:44,302 --> 00:21:46,601
- Yes, we did.
- Did you immediately identify yourselves?

347
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:49,130
The informant's position
was becoming untenable.

348
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:51,439
- We were afraid she was in danger.
- Turns out you were right.

349
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:53,968
- No fucking kidding, nine-to-fiver.
- Excuse me, detective?

350
00:21:54,012 --> 00:21:56,413
Are you finished
with my client?

351
00:21:58,384 --> 00:22:02,343
- They're like Lennon and McCartney.
- Not an inch of daylight between them.

352
00:22:02,387 --> 00:22:03,615
What do you think?

353
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:04,952
Nothing there.

354
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,857
They endangered the informant.
We can't make them wrong on that.

355
00:22:07,894 --> 00:22:09,520
They saw a gun, they reacted.

356
00:22:09,561 --> 00:22:11,325
They beat the fuck
out of the suspect,

357
00:22:11,364 --> 00:22:13,457
but he's not filing charges.

358
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:15,557
Let's see what the shrink says.

359
00:22:16,568 --> 00:22:18,969
So what are we gonna
do now, doc?

360
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:21,200
Are we gonna find out
if I'm sane enough

361
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,970
to carry a gun,
chase bad guys?

362
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:26,604
Okay, why did you become a cop?

363
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:29,375
Well, it was New Year's Eve.
It seemed like a good idea at the time.

364
00:22:29,414 --> 00:22:33,317
I didn't have the same opportunities
you had, Dr. Prosky.

365
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:36,048
Where I come from
it was either a gun and a badge

366
00:22:36,087 --> 00:22:37,952
or a hard hat and a hammer.

367
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:40,458
How do you feel
when you fire your weapon?

368
00:22:40,492 --> 00:22:43,222
It's like dirty Harry said...
"There's nothing wrong

369
00:22:43,261 --> 00:22:45,890
with a little shooting as long as
the right people get shot."

370
00:22:45,932 --> 00:22:47,865
Prosky: And when the wrong people
get shot?

371
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,868
Turk: It sucks, but I'd rather be in it
that out of it.

372
00:22:50,903 --> 00:22:52,996
There's nothing worse
than being stuck on a bench.

373
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:55,269
How do you feel when you see
innocent people get killed?

374
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:57,538
You know...

375
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:02,509
I sort of get numb to it.

376
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:05,210
Here.

377
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,740
I want you to take this.

378
00:23:06,786 --> 00:23:10,153
Use it to jot down your thoughts,
your questions,

379
00:23:10,189 --> 00:23:12,680
anything you may have noticed
about yourself,

380
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:14,192
whatever.

381
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,057
I won't ask for it.

382
00:23:16,095 --> 00:23:18,858
Just for you.

383
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:20,387
I want you to try it.

384
00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:22,458
Sounds like fun.

385
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:27,897
(Karen panting)
Harder.

386
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:37,045
(crowd cheering)

387
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:43,919
Go, Turk, go!

388
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:48,351
You got third.
Go go!

389
00:23:48,394 --> 00:23:51,089
Yeah!
Look at that.

390
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:53,496
You own it. You own it.

391
00:23:53,531 --> 00:23:55,396
No matter what they say
about you,

392
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:57,527
you're tremendous!

393
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:01,936
Go go, Turk, go!

394
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:05,868
Safe.
You dropped the ball.

395
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:08,242
- A fucking cheap shot, man.
- Get away from the bag.

396
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:11,214
- Or what? Or what? Or what?
- Watch the bag.

397
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:14,913
(all yelling)

398
00:24:22,862 --> 00:24:25,296
Turk's voice: The NYPD is bubbling
with frustration,

399
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:26,923
hostility and testosterone,

400
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:28,957
ready to erupt
at any moment.

401
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,026
Think of me
as the release valve.

402
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:33,903
One flick of the trigger
and the pressure goes down.

403
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:36,031
You know why
you join the force?

404
00:24:36,075 --> 00:24:38,167
To get respect.

405
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:39,939
Most people respect the badge.

406
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:42,310
Everybody respects the gun.

407
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:49,743
Hey, Riley, I was talking to Jo...

408
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:52,848
you guys caught a stiff named
Phillip Trager, a gun-runner?

409
00:24:52,892 --> 00:24:55,122
Oh, yeah, a real piece of shit.

410
00:24:55,161 --> 00:24:57,095
- How did that go down?
- I don't know.

411
00:24:57,128 --> 00:24:59,393
Somebody gave him a taste
of his own medicine, I guess,

412
00:24:59,432 --> 00:25:01,832
walked right into his apartment,
killed him with one of his own guns.

413
00:25:01,866 --> 00:25:04,131
Did the shooter leave a note
or anything?

414
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:07,138
Yeah, actually,
the shooter left a poem.

415
00:25:10,241 --> 00:25:12,767
He did?
No shit.

416
00:25:12,811 --> 00:25:14,803
Yeah. Hey, Simon,

417
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:18,282
you remember that poem
from the Trager case?

418
00:25:20,286 --> 00:25:22,345
What are you doing, man?

419
00:25:22,387 --> 00:25:24,378
Turk's asking about it.

420
00:25:24,423 --> 00:25:26,891
What the hell are you doing?

421
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:29,359
? Que mierda 'tas haciendo ahi, papa?

422
00:25:29,394 --> 00:25:31,328
No le digas mierda a eso loco.

423
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:34,991
Riley: Calmate. He wants to hear
about the poem.

424
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:37,263
"Merchant of thieving class,

425
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:40,431
I slit his throat
and capped his ass.

426
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:41,940
I took his gun, I took his...

427
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:44,965
I took his life, I took his gun,
But too bad he's not the only one."

428
00:25:45,009 --> 00:25:47,068
That's how it goes,
something like that.

429
00:25:47,113 --> 00:25:49,411
It's not iambic pentameter,
but it rhymes.

430
00:25:49,448 --> 00:25:51,439
- Rooster.
- Yo.

431
00:25:52,451 --> 00:25:54,351
We're looking for the same guy.

432
00:25:54,385 --> 00:25:57,548
He knocked off a pimp named Rambo
a few weeks ago. When was yours?

433
00:25:57,589 --> 00:26:00,115
Last week. We're running ours with the ATF
because of the guns.

434
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:03,219
We're back in business on the Rambo case.
Looks like the same guy knocked off

435
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:05,695
- a gun dealer on the three-three last week.
- No shit.

436
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:08,700
- What do you mean? That's our case.
- That's our case. You're taking our case.

437
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:11,201
Seniority, guys.
Tag along, you'll learn something.

438
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:13,397
Oh, tell me the guy's name
is Greg Brady.

439
00:26:13,439 --> 00:26:15,406
Please. It is, isn't it?

440
00:26:15,441 --> 00:26:18,000
Oh, somebody's knocking off
the Brady Bunch.

441
00:26:18,042 --> 00:26:21,911
Gotta be the Partridge Family.
(laughs)

442
00:26:21,946 --> 00:26:25,007
Turk's voice: Trager,
a gun-runner bites the dust...

443
00:26:25,049 --> 00:26:27,108
number 11.

444
00:26:35,493 --> 00:26:39,294
Karen: The bullet matched the.45
in Trager's apartment.

445
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:41,798
That was no surprise.
So I ran it through ATF.

446
00:26:41,834 --> 00:26:44,859
It's one of a batch of six
that was stolen from a gun shop

447
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:47,201
- in Virginia last month.
- Yeah, probably by Trager.

448
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:49,934
That's what they think.
He matches the description they have.

449
00:26:49,974 --> 00:26:52,671
It still doesn't help us find the guy.
It just helps us tie him to the victims,

450
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:55,201
which he's already doing
with his little fucking poems.

451
00:26:55,247 --> 00:26:58,307
- (phone ringing)
- Excuse me. Hello.

452
00:26:58,349 --> 00:27:01,580
Hey, Turk, don't forget
we got a court date later.

453
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:04,782
So...

454
00:27:04,824 --> 00:27:08,452
I heard he kicked the shit
out of that dealer you guys took down.

455
00:27:08,493 --> 00:27:10,325
Spider.

456
00:27:10,362 --> 00:27:11,521
So?

457
00:27:13,199 --> 00:27:15,690
Did he?

458
00:27:18,537 --> 00:27:21,164
Yeah, he got him
down on the ground.

459
00:27:21,207 --> 00:27:23,606
The guy was handcuffed.

460
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:27,703
And he just started
kicking him in the gut.

461
00:27:27,746 --> 00:27:30,145
And then

462
00:27:30,182 --> 00:27:32,513
he gets down on the guy's chest

463
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:35,884
and he really starts smacking him

464
00:27:35,921 --> 00:27:38,855
hard in the face over and over

465
00:27:38,891 --> 00:27:40,882
and screaming at the top
of his lungs,

466
00:27:40,925 --> 00:27:43,190
"I'm gonna break
your fucking face,

467
00:27:43,229 --> 00:27:45,628
you little bitch!"

468
00:27:45,663 --> 00:27:47,996
Then his eyes really started
to fill up.

469
00:27:48,032 --> 00:27:50,023
I mean, they get dark...

470
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:52,230
you know how he gets
the sort of rage in him.

471
00:27:53,372 --> 00:27:56,034
I thought he was gonna
kill this guy.

472
00:27:57,409 --> 00:27:59,876
Really?

473
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,980
You're a bad little girl.

474
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:06,882
Hmm?

475
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:09,979
- I got work to do.
- You bet.

476
00:28:11,957 --> 00:28:15,357
Woman: Counselor,
my hands are tied here.

477
00:28:15,394 --> 00:28:17,384
Without a secure
chain of custody,

478
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:20,159
any evidence obtained
after the initial search

479
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:22,666
- must be excluded.
- You gotta be fucking kidding me.

480
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:25,067
Therefore I am forced
to grant defense

481
00:28:25,104 --> 00:28:27,402
motion to dismiss
all charges

482
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:29,634
of rape and assault
against Mr. Van Luytens.

483
00:28:29,674 --> 00:28:31,665
- Your Honor.
- Judge: You think I want this guy

484
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,871
going anywhere
near my daughter,

485
00:28:33,913 --> 00:28:36,074
or anyone's daughter
for that matter?

486
00:28:36,115 --> 00:28:38,583
You messed up.
I am unleashing your client

487
00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:40,881
unto the world.
I'm sure we'll all be

488
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,353
back here again very soon.

489
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:45,380
Look at him.
Look at this motherfucker.

490
00:28:45,423 --> 00:28:49,019
Hey, it's gonna come back to you, mutt.
You're gonna get it.

491
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,494
- When you walk outside watch your back.
- Easy, Turk.

492
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:52,690
Order in my court.

493
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:55,996
- Okay, mutt? You fucking mutt.
- Not here, not now.

494
00:28:56,035 --> 00:28:58,469
Not here, not now.
Will you get him out of here

495
00:28:58,503 --> 00:29:01,064
before somebody passes a sentence
on him you can't appeal?

496
00:29:01,105 --> 00:29:02,334
Order!

497
00:29:02,374 --> 00:29:05,501
- You know what I mean? Go go.
- Order, detective.

498
00:29:05,544 --> 00:29:09,502
Turk's voice: Dr. Prosky suggested
that I free-associate.

499
00:29:09,548 --> 00:29:11,948
So here I go.

500
00:29:11,983 --> 00:29:14,612
You know what I think about
when I pull a trigger?

501
00:29:14,653 --> 00:29:17,587
- I think about the Infield Fly Rule.
- (doorbell buzzes)

502
00:29:17,623 --> 00:29:20,648
I love that fucking rule.
It assumes the worst in everybody.

503
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:24,390
It says, "Sorry, batter, you're a schmuck
for popping up with runners on.

504
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,829
And you, stupid-ass infielder,
you don't get to cheat

505
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:29,298
and drop the ball just because
you caught a break."

506
00:29:29,335 --> 00:29:30,996
My favorite part...
the batter's out

507
00:29:31,036 --> 00:29:33,197
but the runners advance
at their own risk.

508
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:35,501
Well, isn't this
a pleasant surprise?

509
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,634
Turk's voice: That's the way
life should be.

510
00:29:37,675 --> 00:29:39,666
You can be a motherfucker
at your own risk.

511
00:29:39,711 --> 00:29:42,942
(muffled gunshots)

512
00:29:42,981 --> 00:29:46,816
Or not.
Van Luytens... one less rapist.

513
00:29:46,852 --> 00:29:49,082
Who's gonna miss him?
Nobody.

514
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:51,281
Number 12 and counting.

515
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:07,436
Whoa whoa, hot coffee.

516
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:09,167
- Good morning, Detective Riley.
- Hey, good morning.

517
00:30:09,208 --> 00:30:11,175
- Door on your left.
- Any signs of forced entry?

518
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:12,904
Doesn't look like it.
Detective Perez is in there.

519
00:30:12,944 --> 00:30:14,344
He's in there already?
All right.

520
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:16,507
- Hey, how about those Mets last night?
- Yeah, how about 'em?

521
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:18,606
Hey, Teddy, Teddy, come here,
check this out.

522
00:30:20,019 --> 00:30:22,384
Wow.

523
00:30:22,421 --> 00:30:23,648
Fuck.

524
00:30:23,689 --> 00:30:26,487
- Oh my God.
- That's big.

525
00:30:26,525 --> 00:30:28,516
And powerful.

526
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:31,426
- What, a plasma screen?
- LCD.

527
00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:33,521
- That's plasma.
- No, it's got to be LCD.

528
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:35,863
- Perez: It wouldn't be that big.
- Hey, guys, guys.

529
00:30:35,901 --> 00:30:39,336
He was shot at close range,
dropped right here.

530
00:30:39,371 --> 00:30:42,134
The pussy doesn't look like he put up
much of a fight, does he, Karen?

531
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:44,232
Nothing to indicate that

532
00:30:44,276 --> 00:30:47,802
in terms of struggle.
No forced entry, cuts, bruises.

533
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:51,076
Hey, nobody wants to hear
about your private life, Officer Corelli.

534
00:30:51,115 --> 00:30:54,346
That's detective to you,
Officer Needledick.

535
00:30:54,385 --> 00:30:56,319
- Ooh.
- Perez: Ouch.

536
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:58,686
- Looks like it's our guy again.
- Who did you get this time?

537
00:30:58,723 --> 00:31:00,384
This is Jonathan Van Luytens.

538
00:31:00,425 --> 00:31:02,359
He owns a couple
of car dealerships.

539
00:31:02,394 --> 00:31:04,726
- Oh, shit.
- He was up on rape charges,

540
00:31:04,762 --> 00:31:06,958
but they got tossed out
last week.

541
00:31:06,999 --> 00:31:08,990
Look at this.

542
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:13,130
"A man devoid of all respect,
Of beauty, charm or intellect,

543
00:31:13,172 --> 00:31:15,605
He took what women
would not give.

544
00:31:15,641 --> 00:31:17,575
He didn't have
the right to live."

545
00:31:17,608 --> 00:31:19,974
That's our boy all right.

546
00:31:20,011 --> 00:31:23,174
Looks like he had a beef
with our old pal Johnny.

547
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:24,307
You know him?

548
00:31:24,348 --> 00:31:26,213
Both: Yeah.

549
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:28,548
He's one slippery
son of a bitch, let me tell you.

550
00:31:28,586 --> 00:31:31,289
Turk: Yeah.

551
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:34,417
Lieutenant: You guys know how much
fun it is to not catch a serial killer?

552
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,189
You got a point here, Lieutenant?

553
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:37,990
The point is

554
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:40,156
you'd better both
think seriously

555
00:31:40,199 --> 00:31:42,291
about whether or not
you want the lead on this case.

556
00:31:42,334 --> 00:31:43,994
You don't think
we're up to this?

557
00:31:45,002 --> 00:31:48,200
Come on, you got what,

558
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,935
about 110 years on the job
between the two of you?

559
00:31:50,976 --> 00:31:54,036
- 120.
- (laughs)

560
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:56,343
I'm telling you, you screw it up
badly enough,

561
00:31:56,381 --> 00:31:58,576
they may try to fuck you
out of your pension.

562
00:31:58,616 --> 00:31:59,845
You want to risk that?

563
00:31:59,884 --> 00:32:01,715
- Yeah.
- Fuck, yeah.

564
00:32:01,752 --> 00:32:06,712
406, Lieutenant. 406.

565
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:09,352
Okay, 406...
what does that mean?

566
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:10,917
Ted Williams.

567
00:32:10,962 --> 00:32:14,022
Ted Williams, the last day of the season,
is batting 400.

568
00:32:14,066 --> 00:32:17,160
Sox manager wants to bench him,
protect his average, right?

569
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:18,999
Williams plays
both games anyway,

570
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:21,005
goes six for eight,
ends up at 406...

571
00:32:21,038 --> 00:32:22,733
the last guy that ever hit
over 400.

572
00:32:22,773 --> 00:32:25,265
Okay, fine. It's all yours.

573
00:32:25,309 --> 00:32:28,336
Just don't go moaning to me
when some traffic cop

574
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,678
pulls your serial killer over
for speeding

575
00:32:30,715 --> 00:32:33,344
and he grabs your
15 minutes of fame and you realize

576
00:32:33,384 --> 00:32:36,548
the asshole could have been
standing right there in front of you

577
00:32:36,587 --> 00:32:39,647
and it would have taken you
1000 light years to nail him.

578
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:41,420
Not for nothing, Lieutenant,

579
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:44,519
light years measures distance,
not time.

580
00:32:46,932 --> 00:32:49,400
Well, thank you, detective.
I'll make a note of that.

581
00:32:49,433 --> 00:32:52,267
Ellis Lynde, 2003.

582
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:55,067
This guy had a history
of cruising gay bars,

583
00:32:55,106 --> 00:32:57,904
picking up twinkies,
beating the shit out of them.

584
00:32:57,942 --> 00:33:00,844
Lynde was found shot dead
in his apartment.

585
00:33:00,878 --> 00:33:03,779
Whoever's doing this
gets up real close to the guys,

586
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:06,477
blows their brains out
without any trouble,

587
00:33:06,518 --> 00:33:08,008
leaves no fingerprints

588
00:33:08,053 --> 00:33:09,849
and obviously
takes pride in his work.

589
00:33:09,887 --> 00:33:14,188
Okay, what could be
murder number two back from '04,

590
00:33:14,226 --> 00:33:15,659
one Matthew Mitrella.

591
00:33:15,693 --> 00:33:17,627
(trails off)

592
00:33:20,632 --> 00:33:22,759
Turk's voice: I was shaking
the first couple of times

593
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,634
I killed in cold blood.

594
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:29,003
I kept thinking if I got caught
they'd kick me off the force.

595
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,669
I wasn't worried about prison,
but losing the gun and the shield...

596
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:32,938
that scared me.

597
00:33:32,978 --> 00:33:35,469
I went into work the next day
expecting to feel different.

598
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:38,607
I thought everybody would look at me
the way cops look at civilians

599
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:40,880
and know which ones are dirty.

600
00:33:47,858 --> 00:33:50,191
But they didn't.
That's when I knew

601
00:33:50,229 --> 00:33:52,823
I could keep on
doing this forever.

602
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:59,903
Turk's voice: So next stop... Spider.

603
00:33:59,938 --> 00:34:01,929
If we shut down his business,

604
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:03,964
maybe he'd be a rat.

605
00:34:04,009 --> 00:34:06,000
We got a lawyer.

606
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:09,809
We needed her to testify
that she bought coke from him.

607
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:12,407
She was a good lawyer.

608
00:34:12,451 --> 00:34:16,911
Me and my partner paid a visit
to Club 404 of Harlem.

609
00:34:16,954 --> 00:34:18,081
A word about him...

610
00:34:18,123 --> 00:34:21,217
Tom Cowen's been my partner
for almost 30 years.

611
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:23,193
He's the best cop
I've ever seen.

612
00:34:25,097 --> 00:34:28,623
I'm always the one
following him through the door.

613
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:30,827
There's a bullet
that was meant for me

614
00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:34,429
that's lodged in his torso.

615
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:36,532
He was my role model.

616
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:38,940
The day I stopped
trying to be Tom Cowen

617
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:41,445
was the greatest day
of my life.

618
00:34:55,293 --> 00:34:58,286
Hey, Rooster,

619
00:34:58,329 --> 00:35:01,356
I was going through the files
on poetry boy.

620
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,630
That's an interesting way
to pass your time.

621
00:35:03,668 --> 00:35:06,103
Okay, there was a gun

622
00:35:06,137 --> 00:35:08,298
found on Charles Randall
when he was arrested.

623
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,568
Yeah.

624
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:12,771
Now in all the other shootings
the gun was left at the scene,

625
00:35:12,811 --> 00:35:15,974
but there are a lot of similarities.
So I mentioned it to Perez and Riley.

626
00:35:16,014 --> 00:35:18,072
I think somebody should go
interview him in prison.

627
00:35:18,115 --> 00:35:20,744
I think there may be a connection.

628
00:35:20,786 --> 00:35:24,244
That's a good idea,
but not Perez and Riley.

629
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:26,722
I mean, not those guys.
They'll screw it up.

630
00:35:26,757 --> 00:35:28,885
This is too important.

631
00:35:28,927 --> 00:35:31,394
Turk and I will handle Randall, okay?

632
00:35:31,429 --> 00:35:32,987
Good work.

633
00:35:56,454 --> 00:35:58,480
(door buzzes)

634
00:36:04,429 --> 00:36:06,795
Detectives, Charles Randall.

635
00:36:08,632 --> 00:36:11,760
What the fuck
do you two scumbags want?

636
00:36:11,802 --> 00:36:14,498
What a greeting.

637
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:17,599
You like poetry, Chuck?

638
00:36:17,641 --> 00:36:18,699
What?

639
00:36:18,744 --> 00:36:21,940
Do you like poetry?

640
00:36:22,981 --> 00:36:26,677
Yeah.
Roses are red, violets are blue,

641
00:36:26,717 --> 00:36:29,652
I want to poke out your fucking eyes
with my dick, you fuck.

642
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:31,679
How's that?

643
00:36:31,722 --> 00:36:34,351
I thought you'd rhyme.
You didn't.

644
00:36:34,393 --> 00:36:36,554
Fuck you.
Fuck both of you.

645
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:38,222
Get me out of here.

646
00:36:38,262 --> 00:36:41,164
(door buzzes)

647
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:44,690
(siren wailing)

648
00:36:44,735 --> 00:36:48,172
(blues playing)

649
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,503
Why the fuck did we even bother
going out there?

650
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:52,635
What would it look like
if we didn't go?

651
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:56,574
Are you gonna relax?

652
00:36:56,614 --> 00:36:58,606
Relax.

653
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:00,550
Yeah, I'll just take it out
on Karen later.

654
00:37:00,585 --> 00:37:02,882
The more I'm with her,
the more abuse she wants.

655
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,182
Sounds like fun.

656
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:05,813
Hey, you want to take her
off my hands?

657
00:37:05,856 --> 00:37:10,317
Be careful, partner, because I have
a very special effect on women.

658
00:37:10,362 --> 00:37:11,556
Go wild.

659
00:37:11,596 --> 00:37:12,994
Whatever.

660
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:16,023
I can't believe I had to face
that piece of shit and look like an idiot.

661
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:19,365
Eh, fuck him.
He's where he belongs.

662
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:21,030
I'm sorry, partner,
I'm really sorry.

663
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:24,007
Stop worrying about it.

664
00:37:25,844 --> 00:37:29,541
Whatever happens,
I'm not taking you down with me.

665
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:32,550
Don't worry about me.
I'm all right, believe me.

666
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:35,849
I don't know what I was thinking.
I just don't know what I was thinking.

667
00:37:35,887 --> 00:37:38,219
You know what you was thinking?
You were thinking

668
00:37:38,255 --> 00:37:40,918
about a 10-year-old girl
who had her skull crushed.

669
00:37:41,927 --> 00:37:44,394
Yeah, I tried to stop you,
but you know what?

670
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:48,695
I admired you that day,
what you did.

671
00:37:48,733 --> 00:37:51,702
That was righteous.

672
00:37:51,735 --> 00:37:55,570
And you don't second-guess yourself
on something like that.

673
00:38:02,581 --> 00:38:04,572
Okay, I'm the killer.

674
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:07,141
I'm the killer.
I show up at your door

675
00:38:07,184 --> 00:38:09,175
or your car window,

676
00:38:09,221 --> 00:38:11,518
and for some reason
you open your door,

677
00:38:11,556 --> 00:38:14,490
you roll down
your car window for me.

678
00:38:14,525 --> 00:38:16,721
So who am I?

679
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:19,126
Someone I know.

680
00:38:19,164 --> 00:38:20,653
Maybe a nice set of tits.

681
00:38:20,699 --> 00:38:22,791
And the poems?
What about the poems?

682
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:25,199
You have to compose the poem
before you got there, right?

683
00:38:25,237 --> 00:38:27,228
Otherwise what, you're gonna
blow out the guy's brains,

684
00:38:27,271 --> 00:38:29,137
sit down and write a little sonnet
for yourself?

685
00:38:29,173 --> 00:38:30,572
No prints on the poems,

686
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:33,601
so probably
I wore gloves when I wrote it.

687
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:36,704
You obviously know your victims.
Between that and the easy access,

688
00:38:36,748 --> 00:38:39,079
I guess that they know you too.
They must.

689
00:38:39,117 --> 00:38:41,550
These guys are all scumbags.
They're not gonna trust anyone,

690
00:38:41,585 --> 00:38:44,146
open the door for anyone,
especially if they don't know them.

691
00:38:44,188 --> 00:38:46,521
Yeah, but I more than know them.

692
00:38:46,557 --> 00:38:48,889
I know everything about them.
I know their moves,

693
00:38:48,927 --> 00:38:50,791
their patterns,
I know their schedules.

694
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:53,626
Okay, so you're following them.
You're staking them out.

695
00:39:06,878 --> 00:39:09,472
Anyone gonna say it?

696
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:11,447
What?

697
00:39:13,952 --> 00:39:16,614
Fuck me.

698
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:20,155
- He's right, it's a cop.
- No.

699
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:22,489
Let's slow down, fellows.
We're getting way ahead of ourselves.

700
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:26,121
- Come on, it's a cop, you know it.
- I don't know shit. Neither do you.

701
00:39:26,164 --> 00:39:29,030
I'm telling your right now,
it's a cop, it's a cop, it's a cop.

702
00:39:29,067 --> 00:39:30,762
What do you mean,
"It's a cop, it's a cop, it's a cop"?

703
00:39:30,802 --> 00:39:34,067
- Where do you come off saying it's a cop?
- Easy, partner, he's just saying it.

704
00:39:34,105 --> 00:39:36,733
- What are you talking about?
- He's just saying...

705
00:39:36,775 --> 00:39:40,074
I know, I know, I know
what he's saying.

706
00:39:41,746 --> 00:39:43,509
And I'm saying it's bullshit.

707
00:39:44,516 --> 00:39:47,485
Shoot me. What the fuck?
But don't say it's a cop.

708
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:54,820
#You cast a spell on me #

709
00:39:54,858 --> 00:39:57,418
#I was blind and now I see #

710
00:39:57,461 --> 00:40:00,454
#You work your magic,
that's the key #

711
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:03,057
#You wave your wand #

712
00:40:03,101 --> 00:40:06,661
#And cast a spell on me... #

713
00:40:06,704 --> 00:40:08,695
Turk: So what about dinner?

714
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:10,331
You feel like going out?

715
00:40:10,375 --> 00:40:12,172
Where?

716
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:14,074
I don't care.
You're the one going.

717
00:40:14,112 --> 00:40:15,943
What is your problem?

718
00:40:15,981 --> 00:40:17,972
No problem.

719
00:40:18,016 --> 00:40:20,143
If you feel like hanging around,
be my guest.

720
00:40:20,184 --> 00:40:21,516
I don't feel like going out.

721
00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:24,715
Fine, just don't bug me.

722
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:28,885
This is the best part of my day
and I don't need you fucking it up.

723
00:40:30,695 --> 00:40:33,686
So you only fuck cops?

724
00:40:33,731 --> 00:40:36,599
Once in a while
I do a fireman or an ex-con.

725
00:40:38,536 --> 00:40:40,197
You lump us in together?

726
00:40:40,237 --> 00:40:42,364
Well, I have some respect
for firemen.

727
00:40:42,407 --> 00:40:44,204
Fuck you.

728
00:40:44,242 --> 00:40:46,175
You know why they take away
your nightstick

729
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:48,440
- when you hang up your uniform?
- No.

730
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,675
They don't trust you with it.

731
00:40:50,715 --> 00:40:52,876
Right now I wouldn't trust
myself with it either.

732
00:40:52,916 --> 00:40:54,942
Shit, you'd probably love that.

733
00:40:54,985 --> 00:40:56,646
Too bad you never met
Van Luytens.

734
00:40:56,688 --> 00:40:58,382
You two really would have
hit it off great.

735
00:40:58,422 --> 00:41:00,583
At least somebody finally
brought some justice down

736
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:02,456
on that dickless little fuck.

737
00:41:02,494 --> 00:41:04,791
Now that is who I'd like to meet.

738
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:06,728
Well, maybe you'll get
your wish one day.

739
00:41:06,764 --> 00:41:08,596
They think it's a cop.

740
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:10,260
- Makes sense.
- Bullshit.

741
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:12,291
It's just some fucking psychopath.

742
00:41:12,336 --> 00:41:14,668
Well, there's plenty of those
on the job.

743
00:41:23,114 --> 00:41:24,672
- Are you sleeping well?
- Not really.

744
00:41:24,715 --> 00:41:26,239
- Yep.
- Eating well?

745
00:41:26,284 --> 00:41:27,751
- No.
- Yeah.

746
00:41:27,786 --> 00:41:28,980
Any recurring nightmares?

747
00:41:29,019 --> 00:41:31,510
Yeah, that I'm stuck
in a room with you forever.

748
00:41:32,724 --> 00:41:34,088
Nope.

749
00:41:34,125 --> 00:41:35,922
Do you think you're fit
to return to duty?

750
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,951
- Abso-fucking-lutely.
- Yeah.

751
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:41,123
- You ever think about retiring?
- You mean, death with benefits?

752
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:42,963
What's not to like?

753
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:44,969
- You ever think about retiring?
- Not really.

754
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:46,994
What have I got to look forward to?

755
00:41:47,038 --> 00:41:49,233
Sailing my 26-footer
around Sheepshead Bay,

756
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:50,706
umpiring cops' softball?

757
00:41:50,742 --> 00:41:52,835
- How about corporate security work?
- It's too dangerous.

758
00:41:52,876 --> 00:41:56,141
- So what are you gonna do?
- Maybe I'll buy a boat.

759
00:41:56,181 --> 00:41:58,273
Turk: All right, look,
I don't know if I believe this,

760
00:41:58,315 --> 00:42:00,079
but I'm just gonna
throw it out there.

761
00:42:00,117 --> 00:42:02,449
You guys say we're looking
for one of our own,

762
00:42:02,487 --> 00:42:06,445
but what if it was an ex-cop,
somebody with an ax to grind?

763
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:08,152
You got one in mind?

764
00:42:08,193 --> 00:42:11,320
He's thinking about Martin Baum

765
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:14,126
our old lieutenant.

766
00:42:14,164 --> 00:42:16,530
So what's the story with him?

767
00:42:16,568 --> 00:42:18,559
He got fired a few years ago.

768
00:42:18,603 --> 00:42:21,800
I'm not saying there's any motive,
but he knew all the victims.

769
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:25,400
Yeah, but Turk,
I knew most of those guys.

770
00:42:25,443 --> 00:42:28,606
So did you, Riley, Perez.
Even Karen knew 'em.

771
00:42:28,646 --> 00:42:30,704
- I'm just throwing it out there.
- Well, maybe you killed 'em.

772
00:42:30,748 --> 00:42:34,047
Yeah, maybe I did.

773
00:42:34,085 --> 00:42:36,246
The poems and the placement
of the weapons

774
00:42:36,286 --> 00:42:38,083
are all we've got
linking the kills,

775
00:42:38,123 --> 00:42:40,818
which means what we gotta do now
is get humping on the forensics.

776
00:42:40,858 --> 00:42:43,224
That shouldn't be
too much of a problem.

777
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:45,251
We already got the girl
working on that.

778
00:42:45,295 --> 00:42:49,061
That's right, Karen's been
humping on it all week, as we speak.

779
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:51,568
What did you say?

780
00:42:51,603 --> 00:42:52,864
Here we go again.

781
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:54,666
- You should watch your mouth.
- Oh, yeah?

782
00:42:54,706 --> 00:42:57,173
He didn't mean anything by it.
Karen and him are ancient history.

783
00:42:57,208 --> 00:42:59,369
- College boy can't speak for himself?
- Yeah, I can speak for myself.

784
00:42:59,409 --> 00:43:01,206
Let me speak for myself...
fuck you, Turk.

785
00:43:01,246 --> 00:43:03,213
Mutt, I'm gonna hit you
on the head with this barbell.

786
00:43:03,248 --> 00:43:05,340
I'm not better than you.
You're not better than me, man.

787
00:43:05,382 --> 00:43:07,077
You put your balls
in your pocket.

788
00:43:07,117 --> 00:43:08,778
And you, fellow officers,

789
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:13,018
a little courtesy
for a fellow professional, you know?

790
00:43:13,056 --> 00:43:16,083
Please. Are we gonna move on
here now?

791
00:43:16,126 --> 00:43:18,117
What are we doing?
Where were we?

792
00:43:18,163 --> 00:43:21,724
Talking about Martin Baum.
What's his story?

793
00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:24,257
Some guys under him
got caught taking money.

794
00:43:24,302 --> 00:43:26,565
Baum stood up for them,
tried to cover it up.

795
00:43:26,603 --> 00:43:29,003
He do time?

796
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:31,873
Well, they pressed charges,
but he plead out and resigned.

797
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:33,900
So what's his beef with you?

798
00:43:33,945 --> 00:43:35,775
I could have lied to protect him,
but I didn't.

799
00:43:35,813 --> 00:43:38,806
Okay, but if he's got a beef with you,
why not go after you?

800
00:43:38,849 --> 00:43:41,340
Why not kill you? Why go around
acting like a serial killer,

801
00:43:41,385 --> 00:43:43,251
killing all these degenerates?
It doesn't make any sense.

802
00:43:43,288 --> 00:43:45,722
- I'm just telling you.
- I'm telling you it doesn't make sense.

803
00:43:45,757 --> 00:43:47,815
I'm throwing it out there.
I'm saying this is what it is.

804
00:43:47,858 --> 00:43:49,952
You want to check him out or not?
I don't give a shit.

805
00:43:49,994 --> 00:43:52,518
- It doesn't make any sense.
- You're the ones that think it's a cop.

806
00:43:52,563 --> 00:43:54,498
I'm just saying here's a cop
with a chip on his shoulder.

807
00:43:54,532 --> 00:43:56,523
Check him out if you want.
I don't give a shit.

808
00:43:56,568 --> 00:43:59,900
Calm down and give a better reason
why Baum could be a suspect, okay?

809
00:43:59,938 --> 00:44:01,701
(door slams)

810
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:04,172
PMS, gotta be.

811
00:44:10,949 --> 00:44:13,849
- Hey, guys.
- What's going on?

812
00:44:13,885 --> 00:44:16,284
I came over to bring you
the FBI report

813
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,289
on the paper
and handwriting.

814
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:20,449
You don't have a problem
with me looking over the evidence

815
00:44:20,490 --> 00:44:22,925
that I collected and processed
for you, do you?

816
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,860
- No problem.
- Put it back, Karen.

817
00:44:24,896 --> 00:44:26,887
- This is fascinating.
- Let's go, come on.

818
00:44:26,931 --> 00:44:28,898
Come on, let's go, let's go.

819
00:44:28,932 --> 00:44:30,730
- What?
- Come on, let's go.

820
00:44:30,768 --> 00:44:32,793
Get your hands off me.

821
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:35,067
I'll give you a little privacy.
I don't want to interrupt anything here.

822
00:44:35,106 --> 00:44:36,902
Are you afraid of me
looking at your old case files?

823
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:39,409
- Is that it?
- Okay, I'm gone. Enjoy.

824
00:44:39,443 --> 00:44:41,434
- What?
- What is it with you?

825
00:44:41,478 --> 00:44:43,503
- What is it with you?
- (door slams)

826
00:44:46,851 --> 00:44:50,309
I'm sorry about last night, okay?

827
00:44:50,355 --> 00:44:53,016
I really am. It's a habit.

828
00:44:53,056 --> 00:44:55,958
Habits can be broken, right?

829
00:44:55,994 --> 00:44:57,393
That's bullshit.

830
00:44:57,427 --> 00:44:58,690
No.

831
00:44:58,730 --> 00:45:01,197
I'm totally serious, all right?

832
00:45:02,666 --> 00:45:04,965
It's not bullshit,

833
00:45:05,003 --> 00:45:06,994
really.

834
00:45:13,677 --> 00:45:16,146
Perez: Why do you think
Turk was so quick to take the lead

835
00:45:16,179 --> 00:45:19,081
on the poetry case, huh?
To keep us from finding the killer, man.

836
00:45:19,117 --> 00:45:21,483
That's what I would do
if I was covering my tracks.

837
00:45:21,518 --> 00:45:24,454
He sticks us on this Baum stakeout
'cause it's more misdirection.

838
00:45:24,489 --> 00:45:25,648
Makes sense.

839
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:27,885
I hate that Turk, man.

840
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:36,556
(buzzing)

841
00:45:56,554 --> 00:45:58,545
Hey, he's coming out.
He's coming out.

842
00:46:00,791 --> 00:46:03,123
Oh, at 2:45 in the morning.

843
00:46:06,396 --> 00:46:09,855
Is it killing time
or is he just killing time?

844
00:46:29,487 --> 00:46:31,978
Come on, Baum,
go kill someone already.

845
00:46:32,023 --> 00:46:34,547
Perez: Yeah, kill Turk, man.
He's the one setting you up.

846
00:46:34,592 --> 00:46:36,059
Do us all a favor.

847
00:46:41,199 --> 00:46:43,690
Hey, did you see Turk's
marksmanship scores?

848
00:46:43,735 --> 00:46:45,293
Did you see this?
It's ridiculous.

849
00:46:45,335 --> 00:46:47,235
Service... 99,
70 out of 100.

850
00:46:47,271 --> 00:46:50,706
Combat Association awards,
department commendations.

851
00:46:50,742 --> 00:46:53,141
This guy could take out your left nut
at 50 yards.

852
00:46:56,414 --> 00:46:58,438
Perez: Did you see the computer
trajectories, man?

853
00:46:58,483 --> 00:46:59,916
Not one stray slug.

854
00:46:59,951 --> 00:47:02,282
Even Berkowitz put a couple
in the Corinthian leather.

855
00:47:07,425 --> 00:47:09,893
Riley: What about Karen?
She come up with anything new?

856
00:47:09,927 --> 00:47:11,791
Perez: No, not yet.

857
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:13,797
If Baum kills somebody
I don't want us to be in the car

858
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:16,197
waiting when it happens, okay?

859
00:47:18,036 --> 00:47:19,697
I'll go.

860
00:47:19,737 --> 00:47:21,728
Attaboy, Teddy, attaboy.

861
00:47:21,773 --> 00:47:23,137
I'm proud of you, son.

862
00:47:26,309 --> 00:47:28,300
(lighter clicks)

863
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:36,512
(cocks gun)
You're Perez, right?

864
00:47:36,554 --> 00:47:37,885
Yeah.

865
00:47:37,922 --> 00:47:39,617
I'm Martin Baum.

866
00:47:43,226 --> 00:47:45,353
I got a permit for this.

867
00:47:45,396 --> 00:47:48,126
I work security
in the diamond district.

868
00:47:48,166 --> 00:47:50,963
So you figure it's a cop
doing the poetry killings?

869
00:47:51,001 --> 00:47:53,869
Someone says, "Check out Baum.
He thinks he got a raw deal."

870
00:47:53,905 --> 00:47:56,338
That's what passes
for police work these days?

871
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:57,864
Do you think
you got a raw deal?

872
00:47:57,909 --> 00:47:59,773
Damn straight.

873
00:47:59,811 --> 00:48:02,143
- Life sucks.
- Yeah.

874
00:48:02,179 --> 00:48:04,739
- Everything okay, Simon?
- Teddy, where the fuck were you, man?

875
00:48:04,782 --> 00:48:07,079
Anything else you want to tell us,
Lieutenant Baum?

876
00:48:07,117 --> 00:48:11,019
- I got something for you in my pocket.
- Huh-uh!

877
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:17,289
A passport, credit card receipts,
boarding passes.

878
00:48:17,327 --> 00:48:19,318
The day Brady was killed

879
00:48:19,362 --> 00:48:21,532
I was escorting a client
to Brazil.

880
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:28,963
Man: Judgment is
the dominion of the Lord.

881
00:48:29,005 --> 00:48:31,907
And if this person,
this worthless rapist

882
00:48:31,943 --> 00:48:34,467
or murderer,
as you describe him,

883
00:48:34,512 --> 00:48:37,913
if he is truly repentant
and seeks absolution,

884
00:48:37,949 --> 00:48:40,315
it must be granted to him.

885
00:48:40,351 --> 00:48:42,784
Your name doesn't ring a bell,

886
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:47,085
but I've had so many
altar boys over the years.

887
00:48:47,125 --> 00:48:49,820
(muffled gunshot)

888
00:48:51,195 --> 00:48:53,186
Turk's voice: So many altar boys

889
00:48:53,231 --> 00:48:55,927
that it's hard to remember
their names.

890
00:48:55,967 --> 00:48:59,027
My name is David Fisk,
Detective First Grade.

891
00:48:59,070 --> 00:49:01,333
You may not
remember me now,

892
00:49:01,371 --> 00:49:04,534
but I guarantee you'll remember my name
for the rest of your life.

893
00:49:04,574 --> 00:49:08,443
Father Connell,
may he rot in hell.

894
00:49:08,478 --> 00:49:10,947
13 down, one to go.

895
00:49:10,981 --> 00:49:13,643
(bells tolling)

896
00:49:13,684 --> 00:49:16,050
(police radio chatter)

897
00:49:19,389 --> 00:49:22,985
Karen: White underwear
below the knee.

898
00:49:23,027 --> 00:49:25,494
- (camera shutter clicking)
- Briefs-style.

899
00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:27,963
Large tweezers.

900
00:49:27,998 --> 00:49:31,456
I am removing a card that has been
inserted in the rectum of the deceased

901
00:49:31,501 --> 00:49:35,528
and placing it
in a plastic evidence bag.

902
00:49:38,242 --> 00:49:41,972
- I'll be right back.
- All right.

903
00:49:43,648 --> 00:49:46,275
Hey. It's another one,

904
00:49:46,317 --> 00:49:48,512
handwritten.

905
00:49:51,789 --> 00:49:54,552
"The old man
who the children trust,

906
00:49:54,592 --> 00:49:58,221
Unable to control his lust,

907
00:49:58,262 --> 00:50:01,163
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

908
00:50:01,199 --> 00:50:05,260
The church can't stop him.
Someone must."

909
00:50:06,637 --> 00:50:08,628
I'll see what else I can find.

910
00:50:14,211 --> 00:50:16,476
What's the matter with you?

911
00:50:16,514 --> 00:50:18,811
Father Connell gave me
my first communion

912
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:21,612
back in Bensonhurst.

913
00:50:23,987 --> 00:50:26,478
Hey, guys.
Sorry we didn't get a chance to call.

914
00:50:26,523 --> 00:50:29,583
- Yeah, I bet you are.
- Go over there, take a look around.

915
00:50:29,626 --> 00:50:31,753
We'll compare notes later, okay?

916
00:50:31,795 --> 00:50:34,923
Looks like our friend just settled
an old score with the priest,

917
00:50:34,965 --> 00:50:36,956
left him with his pants down.

918
00:50:37,001 --> 00:50:38,628
- Come on.
- No, look.

919
00:50:38,668 --> 00:50:40,135
Come on, don't talk like that.

920
00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:42,139
- Hey, look for yourself.
- Have a little respect.

921
00:50:43,673 --> 00:50:46,871
Next thing they're gonna tell us
Lieutenant Baum was an altar boy here.

922
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:50,347
Tell me about it.
These two guys fucking stink.

923
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:52,713
Look, doctor,
you read the poems.

924
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:54,980
It is possible, right,
that this guy is a cop?

925
00:50:55,018 --> 00:50:57,385
I've never seen it.

926
00:50:57,420 --> 00:51:00,219
I've never even heard
about a cop serial killer.

927
00:51:00,257 --> 00:51:02,418
Come on, girls,
let's go, let's go.

928
00:51:03,427 --> 00:51:07,385
Yeah. Go go go go go
go go go go!

929
00:51:07,431 --> 00:51:08,454
Safe.

930
00:51:08,498 --> 00:51:10,967
Doc, give us a tip.
How are we gonna catch this guy?

931
00:51:11,001 --> 00:51:12,992
You don't have to worry
about that.

932
00:51:13,036 --> 00:51:14,697
He wants to get caught.

933
00:51:17,007 --> 00:51:19,670
You don't have any better place
to have lunch?

934
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:21,507
I wanted to thank you.

935
00:51:21,545 --> 00:51:23,273
What, about Spider?

936
00:51:23,313 --> 00:51:24,974
Yeah.

937
00:51:25,016 --> 00:51:27,610
And for looking in on me
at the hospital

938
00:51:27,652 --> 00:51:29,175
and the encouragement.

939
00:51:29,219 --> 00:51:30,516
Why would he want that?

940
00:51:30,554 --> 00:51:33,114
After a while
getting away with it isn't enough.

941
00:51:33,157 --> 00:51:35,148
Jessica: So is your daughter
on the team?

942
00:51:35,192 --> 00:51:38,025
No, she used to play,
but now she's 25, living in California,

943
00:51:38,061 --> 00:51:40,757
five years sober
and working as a nurse.

944
00:51:40,797 --> 00:51:42,958
And her mother?

945
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,025
Her mother died
when she was very young.

946
00:51:46,036 --> 00:51:48,972
Doctor: He wants everybody to know
that he got away with it,

947
00:51:49,005 --> 00:51:53,032
to show everybody
just how brilliant he is.

948
00:51:53,077 --> 00:51:56,239
Most of these killings were criminals
in Rooster's and his beat, right?

949
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:58,144
And then he all but threatens
to kill Van Luytens

950
00:51:58,181 --> 00:52:00,150
in front of hundreds of witnesses.
And then he sends us

951
00:52:00,184 --> 00:52:03,244
on this crazy wild goose chase
after Lieutenant Baum, didn't he?

952
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:05,277
- Yes, he did.
- Why would he do that? Why?

953
00:52:05,322 --> 00:52:07,847
You gotta show me more than that.
So far you got shit.

954
00:52:07,891 --> 00:52:09,483
- Give him more, man.
- You want more?

955
00:52:09,527 --> 00:52:12,155
- How about the church records?
- The very ones that Turk was

956
00:52:12,195 --> 00:52:14,130
so diligently pursuing.
How about that?

957
00:52:14,164 --> 00:52:17,065
It turns out our most recent victim,
the late Father Connell,

958
00:52:17,101 --> 00:52:19,831
was moved all over the place...
eight parishes in 20 years.

959
00:52:19,869 --> 00:52:22,360
Why would they do that
with a Catholic priest? It's obvious.

960
00:52:22,405 --> 00:52:24,896
He's giving the children
more than communion behind the altar.

961
00:52:24,942 --> 00:52:27,376
Now Turk already admits
to knowing this guy as a child.

962
00:52:27,411 --> 00:52:28,742
It's very plausible.

963
00:52:30,181 --> 00:52:33,344
Lieutenant: This priest,
this Father Connell,

964
00:52:33,384 --> 00:52:35,079
he gave you your first
holy communion, eh?

965
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:36,244
He did.

966
00:52:36,286 --> 00:52:39,518
Did he every try to do
anything inappropriate? I mean...

967
00:52:39,556 --> 00:52:41,547
I know what you mean.
No, never.

968
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:45,251
Okay, fine.
Is there any reason

969
00:52:45,295 --> 00:52:47,525
why somebody out there
might think that he did?

970
00:52:47,565 --> 00:52:49,123
No.

971
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:51,498
Am I a suspect here, Lieutenant?

972
00:52:52,536 --> 00:52:54,561
No,

973
00:52:54,605 --> 00:52:58,438
but these bodies
are starting to smell.

974
00:52:58,476 --> 00:53:01,070
A lot of it is drifting
in your direction.

975
00:53:01,112 --> 00:53:03,103
Drifting or being pushed?

976
00:53:03,146 --> 00:53:05,239
What can I say?

977
00:53:05,282 --> 00:53:07,715
You got connections
to most of these victims.

978
00:53:07,751 --> 00:53:10,686
You're not exactly
Mother Teresa.

979
00:53:11,989 --> 00:53:14,889
I never had any problem
with that priest.

980
00:53:14,925 --> 00:53:17,860
Okay. Okay, fine.

981
00:53:17,894 --> 00:53:20,625
That settles it.

982
00:53:26,771 --> 00:53:28,864
I had a talk with Riley and Perez.

983
00:53:28,905 --> 00:53:30,429
Good cops.

984
00:53:30,474 --> 00:53:32,942
Don't fuck around, okay?
Just listen.

985
00:53:32,976 --> 00:53:34,239
I'm listening.

986
00:53:34,277 --> 00:53:36,677
They think
Turk might be our guy.

987
00:53:40,583 --> 00:53:42,813
Oh, man. I gotta tell you,

988
00:53:42,853 --> 00:53:45,548
from where I'm sitting
that is so fucking funny.

989
00:53:45,588 --> 00:53:47,648
You can't take that seriously.

990
00:53:47,690 --> 00:53:50,659
Everybody has pretty much
accepted the fact

991
00:53:50,693 --> 00:53:53,253
- that we're chasing one of our own.
- But it ain't Turk.

992
00:53:53,297 --> 00:53:55,059
Sure as I'm sitting here
he ain't the guy.

993
00:53:55,099 --> 00:53:56,726
- You know that?
- Yes, I do.

994
00:53:56,766 --> 00:53:59,235
- How do you know that?
- Because I know it.

995
00:53:59,269 --> 00:54:01,829
I know it to a moral certainty.

996
00:54:01,871 --> 00:54:03,338
Okay?

997
00:54:04,541 --> 00:54:06,532
This priest,

998
00:54:06,577 --> 00:54:09,170
this Father Connell...

999
00:54:09,213 --> 00:54:11,510
he was Turk's priest
when he was a kid.

1000
00:54:11,548 --> 00:54:12,572
He told you that.

1001
00:54:12,615 --> 00:54:14,914
He didn't tell me this priest
was a child molester.

1002
00:54:14,952 --> 00:54:17,887
- I can't believe this bullshit.
- Believe it, all right?

1003
00:54:17,922 --> 00:54:20,481
- Turk's a good guy.
- You understand?

1004
00:54:20,523 --> 00:54:22,788
- He's the best cop you got.
- Don't you tell me what I gotta do.

1005
00:54:22,827 --> 00:54:24,885
Don't you say a goddamn word
to him about this either,

1006
00:54:24,929 --> 00:54:26,862
or you're finished.

1007
00:54:30,201 --> 00:54:33,693
(humming a tune)

1008
00:54:36,806 --> 00:54:38,797
Can I speak now?

1009
00:54:38,842 --> 00:54:40,639
Feel free.

1010
00:54:41,644 --> 00:54:45,478
He cares.
You know what I'm saying?

1011
00:54:45,516 --> 00:54:48,416
Turk cares about people.

1012
00:54:49,753 --> 00:54:52,744
I know he runs around
like a pit bull on crack sometimes.

1013
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:55,384
It doesn't matter.

1014
00:54:55,425 --> 00:54:57,690
He cares about protecting people.

1015
00:54:57,728 --> 00:54:59,786
And if you don't back him,

1016
00:54:59,829 --> 00:55:03,701
you will regret it.

1017
00:55:23,219 --> 00:55:24,880
(bangs)

1018
00:55:24,922 --> 00:55:26,411
Jesus.

1019
00:55:26,456 --> 00:55:28,186
Sorry.

1020
00:55:28,224 --> 00:55:30,920
I just never rattled
anyone's cage before.

1021
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:34,021
- Got a minute?
- Yeah, what's up?

1022
00:55:34,063 --> 00:55:37,465
You know me and Turk
are buddies, right?

1023
00:55:37,501 --> 00:55:38,990
Of course.

1024
00:55:39,036 --> 00:55:40,525
I'd do anything for him.

1025
00:55:40,570 --> 00:55:42,971
He would do anything for you.

1026
00:55:43,007 --> 00:55:44,235
Would you?

1027
00:55:44,275 --> 00:55:45,798
Would I what?

1028
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:47,867
Would you do anything for him?

1029
00:55:51,414 --> 00:55:53,211
I don't know...
where is this going?

1030
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:55,275
He wants you
to have sex with me.

1031
00:55:57,420 --> 00:55:59,320
Really?

1032
00:56:01,224 --> 00:56:03,056
He wouldn't mind.

1033
00:56:03,092 --> 00:56:05,789
But that's not why I'm here.

1034
00:56:05,829 --> 00:56:08,490
Okay, why are you here?

1035
00:56:08,532 --> 00:56:11,762
Where were you
the night Rambo was killed

1036
00:56:11,802 --> 00:56:14,771
and Trager?
Got an alibi for those nights?

1037
00:56:16,273 --> 00:56:19,503
I mean, did you know either one
those guys before they were murdered?

1038
00:56:19,543 --> 00:56:22,512
Makes you uncomfortable
when I talk like that.

1039
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:25,344
You look like you're guilty.
You're not guilty.

1040
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:27,474
I know that.
You didn't kill those guys, did you?

1041
00:56:31,155 --> 00:56:34,181
Now you know what Turk feels.

1042
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:41,958
I need you to get me
some information

1043
00:56:41,998 --> 00:56:44,023
discreetly.

1044
00:56:45,668 --> 00:56:47,101
Can you do that for me?

1045
00:56:47,137 --> 00:56:49,400
You got it.

1046
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,101
Absolutely.

1047
00:56:51,141 --> 00:56:53,132
Let's solve these fucking murders.

1048
00:56:55,311 --> 00:56:57,472
(phone rings)

1049
00:56:57,514 --> 00:56:58,878
Oh.

1050
00:56:58,916 --> 00:57:01,009
- Rooster: Hey, boy genius.
- Perfect timing, buddy.

1051
00:57:01,050 --> 00:57:03,076
Listen, you really worked
on Hingis, didn't you?

1052
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:04,815
He was all worked up
about my partner.

1053
00:57:04,855 --> 00:57:06,755
Good. He should be.

1054
00:57:06,789 --> 00:57:09,349
I think we should sit down,
see if we can square things, okay?

1055
00:57:09,393 --> 00:57:12,590
All right. Want to meet at Montrose
at 8:00 PM?

1056
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:15,929
Could you make that 9:00?
I gotta meet an old friend.

1057
00:57:15,965 --> 00:57:17,592
Yeah, sure, whatever you want.

1058
00:57:20,137 --> 00:57:23,436
(blues playing)
#Baby's got issues #

1059
00:57:23,474 --> 00:57:26,931
#Baby's got pains... #

1060
00:57:26,976 --> 00:57:28,967
- Hey, fellows.
- Hey.

1061
00:57:29,012 --> 00:57:32,175
Thanks for coming.

1062
00:57:32,215 --> 00:57:34,844
- This here is Cheryl Brooks.
- Hello, Cheryl Brooks.

1063
00:57:34,885 --> 00:57:36,876
Cheryl's got something to tell you.

1064
00:57:38,054 --> 00:57:41,684
My daughter Lynn

1065
00:57:41,724 --> 00:57:44,250
died four years ago.

1066
00:57:44,293 --> 00:57:47,228
She was 10 years old.
She was raped and she was murdered.

1067
00:57:49,333 --> 00:57:53,463
The guy I was living with,
Charles...

1068
00:57:53,503 --> 00:57:54,664
Charles Randall.

1069
00:57:54,704 --> 00:57:57,798
Yeah, Charles Randall... he did it.

1070
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:00,639
Why are you telling us this?

1071
00:58:00,677 --> 00:58:03,806
Because he got off for that.
He was acquitted at trial.

1072
00:58:03,847 --> 00:58:06,077
- Because?
- Because?

1073
00:58:07,851 --> 00:58:10,148
I testified for him.

1074
00:58:10,186 --> 00:58:13,019
- You did what?
- I said he was with me.

1075
00:58:14,590 --> 00:58:18,288
You see, Cheryl here is
a very forgiving person,

1076
00:58:18,327 --> 00:58:20,626
unlike us hard-asses.

1077
00:58:20,664 --> 00:58:22,927
- He threatened to kill me.
- Okay, Cheryl.

1078
00:58:22,965 --> 00:58:26,423
Now you say goodbye
to the nice officers

1079
00:58:26,469 --> 00:58:30,304
and you go on back home.

1080
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:33,137
Don't drink yourself to death.

1081
00:58:35,244 --> 00:58:37,769
Okay, so...

1082
00:58:37,815 --> 00:58:40,181
eh?

1083
00:58:43,086 --> 00:58:45,817
I want to hear you say it.

1084
00:58:45,856 --> 00:58:48,449
Come on, say it.

1085
00:58:52,896 --> 00:58:56,889
We planted the gun
in Randall's apartment, okay?

1086
00:58:56,934 --> 00:58:59,266
I said it. Happy?

1087
00:58:59,302 --> 00:59:00,894
- Thank you.
- Yes, I am.

1088
00:59:00,938 --> 00:59:03,702
I'd do it again if I had to
'cause that fucking maggot

1089
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:07,541
could rot away for all eternity.
I'd sleep just fine.

1090
00:59:07,577 --> 00:59:08,976
So what do you want from us?

1091
00:59:09,012 --> 00:59:11,503
You guys think
my partner's a serial killer.

1092
00:59:11,547 --> 00:59:13,344
You're way off.

1093
00:59:13,382 --> 00:59:16,443
You like Turk for this thing?
Go have your fun.

1094
00:59:16,487 --> 00:59:18,887
I'll go along with you.

1095
00:59:18,922 --> 00:59:21,481
I'll even help you.

1096
00:59:21,525 --> 00:59:25,188
But do not drag up Chuck Randall
and that fucking gun,

1097
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:28,664
because if he walks out of jail
he's gonna end up dead.

1098
00:59:28,699 --> 00:59:30,757
Excuse me?

1099
00:59:32,335 --> 00:59:35,771
I'll put two
through his fucking head

1100
00:59:35,806 --> 00:59:38,365
myself.

1101
00:59:38,407 --> 00:59:40,672
Done deal.

1102
00:59:40,710 --> 00:59:43,838
(soprano singing)

1103
00:59:53,724 --> 00:59:56,659
My grandmother loved opera.

1104
00:59:56,693 --> 00:59:58,717
She supported us by sewing.

1105
00:59:58,762 --> 01:00:01,856
I used to thread needles
for my grandmother.

1106
01:00:01,898 --> 01:00:04,197
- Gave all her money to church.
- You admired her?

1107
01:00:04,233 --> 01:00:06,360
I worshiped her.

1108
01:00:06,402 --> 01:00:09,201
Rooster? Yeah, he's religious,
goes to church.

1109
01:00:09,239 --> 01:00:10,934
Prosky: How about you?

1110
01:00:10,974 --> 01:00:14,568
Turk's voice: Our job is keeping
99% of the population safe

1111
01:00:14,610 --> 01:00:18,047
from the other 1%.

1112
01:00:18,081 --> 01:00:21,675
The problem is that we have to
spend half our lives with that 1%.

1113
01:00:21,717 --> 01:00:23,514
And the better we do that job,

1114
01:00:23,554 --> 01:00:26,114
the less the other 99% think
they need us.

1115
01:00:26,155 --> 01:00:28,784
They're clueless.

1116
01:00:28,826 --> 01:00:30,760
The only ones paying attention
on the street

1117
01:00:30,793 --> 01:00:33,193
are the cops and the criminals.
Everyone else is just

1118
01:00:33,230 --> 01:00:35,994
going somewhere
or shopping.

1119
01:00:41,637 --> 01:00:43,833
- Umpire: Out.
- Come on.

1120
01:00:43,873 --> 01:00:46,364
I got an order here placing you
on restricted duty.

1121
01:00:46,409 --> 01:00:48,900
Now in plain English that means
you'll work at your desk.

1122
01:00:48,945 --> 01:00:51,005
You might want to cooperate
with the shrink

1123
01:00:51,047 --> 01:00:53,811
next time you two meet,
and you will meet again.

1124
01:00:57,753 --> 01:01:00,688
Cool my fucking heels.
Cool my fucking heels, huh?

1125
01:01:00,724 --> 01:01:03,454
I'm gonna blow a fucking hole
in that motherfucker Perez

1126
01:01:03,492 --> 01:01:06,360
and blow right through his head
for putting me through this bullshit.

1127
01:01:06,396 --> 01:01:08,295
- Turk.
- Fuck, I'm gonna...

1128
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:09,628
kill that motherfucker.

1129
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:12,463
Calm down. What the hell is it?
You're making all the wrong moves.

1130
01:01:12,501 --> 01:01:14,333
What are you talking about?
This ain't a chess game, partner.

1131
01:01:14,371 --> 01:01:16,804
Who knows? Maybe it is.
You go at Perez now...

1132
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:19,331
you know what's gonna happen?
You're gonna walk right into a trap.

1133
01:01:19,376 --> 01:01:21,536
You are.
They're just waiting for you.

1134
01:01:21,577 --> 01:01:23,273
Fucking Hingis.

1135
01:01:23,313 --> 01:01:25,577
Fucking Hingis believes him.

1136
01:01:25,615 --> 01:01:28,608
He actually fucking believes
that motherfucking Perez.

1137
01:01:28,652 --> 01:01:30,141
Stay back. Wait.

1138
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:33,623
Wait for the right time,
then fire away.

1139
01:01:33,657 --> 01:01:35,521
Not now. Now is not the right time.

1140
01:01:35,559 --> 01:01:37,856
Believe me.

1141
01:01:37,894 --> 01:01:40,226
You believe me?
Now is not the time.

1142
01:01:40,264 --> 01:01:41,356
Uh-huh.

1143
01:01:41,398 --> 01:01:43,525
- Please.
- Yeah.

1144
01:01:43,567 --> 01:01:47,333
Hey, Turk, I gotta skip tonight.
My class ran late.

1145
01:01:47,371 --> 01:01:49,771
(over phone) But I'll see you
tomorrow, all right?

1146
01:01:49,806 --> 01:01:52,706
And I'm sorry about what happened
with you and Lieutenant Hingis today.

1147
01:01:52,742 --> 01:01:54,869
It's gonna be fine.
It'll blow over.

1148
01:01:54,911 --> 01:01:57,847
People are just... everyone's crazy.
People are overreacting.

1149
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:00,543
All right? Good night.

1150
01:02:06,789 --> 01:02:08,951
It's a cop, it's a cop, it's a cop.

1151
01:02:15,731 --> 01:02:18,063
(car engine starts)

1152
01:02:18,101 --> 01:02:20,501
What you got for me, good-looking?

1153
01:02:25,708 --> 01:02:28,768
Mark my words, there's a reason
Perez is gunning for me.

1154
01:02:28,811 --> 01:02:31,541
- (tenor singing)
- Perez is too smart to be that stupid.

1155
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:34,208
For one thing, all that college-boy crap...
that's bullshit.

1156
01:02:34,251 --> 01:02:36,481
He did one year at SUNY,
only one year.

1157
01:02:36,519 --> 01:02:37,509
No kidding.

1158
01:02:37,554 --> 01:02:39,954
They threw him out...
disruptive influence.

1159
01:02:39,989 --> 01:02:42,686
And I hear from the 240 he mixed it up bad
with a captain over there.

1160
01:02:42,726 --> 01:02:44,956
The guy is a total
fucking asshole.

1161
01:02:44,994 --> 01:02:46,826
(man with Russian accent)
BMW 3 series,

1162
01:02:46,862 --> 01:02:49,195
Mercedes CLK... too light.

1163
01:02:49,231 --> 01:02:52,201
BMW 7 series...
the biggest engine.

1164
01:02:52,235 --> 01:02:54,896
That's what you have to get.
If they shoot at you,

1165
01:02:54,938 --> 01:02:57,735
you still want
to get the fuck out of there...

1166
01:02:57,773 --> 01:02:59,434
(men laughing)

1167
01:02:59,476 --> 01:03:01,306
(imitating)
Bentley... very good

1168
01:03:01,344 --> 01:03:04,108
because can fuck two prostitutes
in back seat

1169
01:03:04,146 --> 01:03:07,878
and mount flame-thrower
on the hood. Da?

1170
01:03:07,918 --> 01:03:09,248
Da.

1171
01:03:09,286 --> 01:03:11,617
- Man: What about a Cadillac?
- Russian: Come on,

1172
01:03:11,655 --> 01:03:15,146
the fucking car can't turn
fucking corner. Are you kidding me?

1173
01:03:15,192 --> 01:03:17,023
You know either one of those
Neanderthals?

1174
01:03:17,059 --> 01:03:19,824
The wop is Joe Scianci from Bensonhurst.
He's a mid-level guy.

1175
01:03:19,862 --> 01:03:21,797
What about Ivan?

1176
01:03:21,831 --> 01:03:23,663
Russian guy,
Yevgeny Magulat,

1177
01:03:23,699 --> 01:03:27,829
an enforcer for the Italians,
works with Gambinos a lot.

1178
01:03:29,005 --> 01:03:30,836
(speaking Russian)

1179
01:03:32,275 --> 01:03:34,936
That shit's getting to me.

1180
01:03:34,978 --> 01:03:37,003
I know it's getting to you.

1181
01:03:38,748 --> 01:03:41,182
Shit gets to me too, you know,

1182
01:03:41,217 --> 01:03:44,311
but I take it in, I let it out
on my own terms.

1183
01:03:45,922 --> 01:03:47,981
I bet you didn't write
one word down

1184
01:03:48,025 --> 01:03:49,925
in that little notebook
Prosky gave us.

1185
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:52,519
Of course not. Did you?

1186
01:03:52,561 --> 01:03:54,893
Yeah, it's great.

1187
01:03:56,465 --> 01:03:58,831
It helps me put things in perspective.

1188
01:03:58,869 --> 01:04:02,862
You know what I'm saying?
Write it down, get it out.

1189
01:04:02,905 --> 01:04:05,431
- You should try this.
- Let's have a look.

1190
01:04:05,474 --> 01:04:08,103
What, are you kidding me?
Oh, come on, come on.

1191
01:04:08,144 --> 01:04:10,612
This belongs to me... private.

1192
01:04:10,646 --> 01:04:15,016
- You don't want to let me see?
- Close to my heart. No, sir.

1193
01:04:15,052 --> 01:04:17,246
I just got sick
of the whole fucking game...

1194
01:04:17,286 --> 01:04:19,755
run around looking for clues,
making arrests,

1195
01:04:19,789 --> 01:04:22,315
write reports, testify, cut deals.

1196
01:04:22,358 --> 01:04:25,260
It was all just so much
fucking bullshit.

1197
01:04:25,295 --> 01:04:28,128
(man whistles)

1198
01:04:28,164 --> 01:04:29,324
Detective...

1199
01:04:29,365 --> 01:04:31,391
(muffled gunshots)

1200
01:04:35,072 --> 01:04:36,471
Then it all got real simple.

1201
01:04:36,505 --> 01:04:39,532
Yeah, Detective Perez here.
Hey, brother, what's up?

1202
01:04:39,576 --> 01:04:42,510
I hate scumbags. I like shooting people.
What was I giving up?

1203
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:45,538
Perez: Hey, look, I set the meeting up
with Rooster first thing tomorrow.

1204
01:04:45,581 --> 01:04:48,983
Come on, you gotta be fast, man.
I don't want Turk getting wind of anything.

1205
01:04:49,018 --> 01:04:51,385
A retirement party and a gold watch?

1206
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:54,219
A handshake from the mayor
and my name on some fucking plaque?

1207
01:04:54,257 --> 01:04:56,987
(speaking indistinctly)

1208
01:04:57,027 --> 01:05:00,427
(gunshots)

1209
01:05:00,463 --> 01:05:01,657
Big fucking deal.

1210
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:04,923
It's better this way.

1211
01:05:06,735 --> 01:05:09,568
Now everybody knows
who I was and where I stood.

1212
01:05:49,612 --> 01:05:51,273
(dials)

1213
01:05:53,048 --> 01:05:55,039
Hey, it's me.

1214
01:05:56,519 --> 01:05:59,978
Listen, I think somebody
followed me here... home.

1215
01:06:00,023 --> 01:06:02,490
He's outside right now.

1216
01:06:02,525 --> 01:06:06,222
Can you come over or...?

1217
01:06:06,262 --> 01:06:09,322
Just call me back, okay?
All right.

1218
01:06:24,614 --> 01:06:27,047
(intercom buzzing)

1219
01:06:34,757 --> 01:06:36,748
(cocks gun)

1220
01:06:39,496 --> 01:06:41,862
Don't move.

1221
01:06:54,744 --> 01:06:57,769
- Come on, open up.
- Turk?

1222
01:07:03,018 --> 01:07:05,179
I just called you.

1223
01:07:05,222 --> 01:07:06,813
Put the gun down.

1224
01:07:06,856 --> 01:07:08,847
There's a car following me.

1225
01:07:08,891 --> 01:07:11,655
Put the gun down.
Put the gun down.

1226
01:07:15,565 --> 01:07:17,054
Have you got
something to tell me?

1227
01:07:17,099 --> 01:07:18,896
About what?

1228
01:07:18,934 --> 01:07:21,494
Trager, Randall.

1229
01:07:21,538 --> 01:07:23,528
Did you sneak
into my apartment?

1230
01:07:23,572 --> 01:07:25,563
What are they doing
on your computer?

1231
01:07:25,608 --> 01:07:27,838
I was checking
all the links in the case.

1232
01:07:31,181 --> 01:07:32,876
Are you hiding something
from me?

1233
01:07:36,119 --> 01:07:37,677
Huh?

1234
01:07:39,188 --> 01:07:42,056
I just received this... this poem.

1235
01:07:42,092 --> 01:07:44,686
A poem?
Not worth mentioning, huh?

1236
01:07:44,728 --> 01:07:47,253
The handwriting
doesn't even match.

1237
01:07:47,297 --> 01:07:49,492
It's a fake.

1238
01:07:49,532 --> 01:07:51,523
Did you write it?

1239
01:07:53,369 --> 01:07:55,929
Did you write it?

1240
01:08:00,143 --> 01:08:02,702
What the hell is going on here?

1241
01:08:02,746 --> 01:08:04,907
You're spending a lot of time
with Perez, aren't you?

1242
01:08:04,947 --> 01:08:06,813
Yeah, I've been working the case.

1243
01:08:06,849 --> 01:08:09,010
What, are you jealous?

1244
01:08:09,052 --> 01:08:11,815
Can I trust you?

1245
01:08:13,956 --> 01:08:16,686
- Yes.
- Okay.

1246
01:08:16,725 --> 01:08:19,159
Get me anything and everything
that you can find out

1247
01:08:19,194 --> 01:08:21,628
about Perez or Riley,
what they know about me.

1248
01:08:23,365 --> 01:08:25,197
Everything.

1249
01:08:25,234 --> 01:08:27,703
Karen, don't play me.

1250
01:08:28,971 --> 01:08:32,635
Hingis: I am leaning much further
into saying that it is a cop.

1251
01:08:32,676 --> 01:08:36,009
Perez: Tell you what... I'm moving
past the leaning stage

1252
01:08:36,046 --> 01:08:38,844
and I'm moving towards the
l-know-for-sure-it's-a-fucking-cop stage,

1253
01:08:38,881 --> 01:08:41,213
considering how expertly
he shot the shit out of my house.

1254
01:08:41,251 --> 01:08:43,515
Hingis: Oh my God.
Are you hurt?

1255
01:08:43,552 --> 01:08:45,645
Am I hurt? Am I hurt?
He wants to know if I'm hurt.

1256
01:08:45,689 --> 01:08:47,222
Actually, he's dead.

1257
01:08:47,222 --> 01:08:49,885
(sirens wailing)

1258
01:08:49,926 --> 01:08:53,259
- Rooster: His name is Magulat.
- Turk: The guy we saw at Salerno's.

1259
01:08:53,296 --> 01:08:56,355
Yeah, he's in intensive care
at St. Luke's.

1260
01:08:56,399 --> 01:08:58,390
They think he's the guy

1261
01:08:58,435 --> 01:09:00,903
- chopped off Yakov Pearlstein's head.
- What do you think?

1262
01:09:00,936 --> 01:09:03,167
You think he's a victim,
or could he be our suspect?

1263
01:09:03,206 --> 01:09:06,231
I don't know, but either way
I think it's gonna be fun.

1264
01:09:07,277 --> 01:09:10,177
Doctor, what's the story?

1265
01:09:10,212 --> 01:09:13,204
He's one of the toughest human beings
I've ever come into contact with.

1266
01:09:13,248 --> 01:09:15,011
We took six bullets
out of him.

1267
01:09:15,051 --> 01:09:16,916
Six? Whoo!

1268
01:09:16,953 --> 01:09:19,716
Three from the night he was wounded,
three from previous shootings.

1269
01:09:19,756 --> 01:09:21,655
The man is a tank.

1270
01:09:21,690 --> 01:09:23,750
Do you mind if I talk to him
a little bit?

1271
01:09:23,792 --> 01:09:26,421
His jaw's wired shut,
but go ahead.

1272
01:09:26,462 --> 01:09:29,363
That's okay. I'll ask the questions.
He can just grunt.

1273
01:09:29,399 --> 01:09:32,333
Hey, Yevgeny.

1274
01:09:32,368 --> 01:09:34,599
(snapping fingers)
Wake up.

1275
01:09:34,636 --> 01:09:39,336
That's it. Wake up,
you big fucking grizzly bear.

1276
01:09:39,376 --> 01:09:41,775
You don't speak Russian?

1277
01:09:41,810 --> 01:09:45,405
Swoboda. Swoboda. Swoboda.

1278
01:09:45,448 --> 01:09:47,939
Ron.

1279
01:09:50,552 --> 01:09:52,713
(moans)

1280
01:09:52,756 --> 01:09:55,987
I'm thinking this Russian killing machine
could be our first eyewitness.

1281
01:09:56,024 --> 01:09:58,720
(beeping more rapidly)

1282
01:09:58,761 --> 01:10:01,628
Wake up, gugumuck.
You can tell us who did this to you.

1283
01:10:05,868 --> 01:10:09,305
- (grunting)
- Detective, I think that's enough.

1284
01:10:09,338 --> 01:10:12,796
Then you could tell us where you put
Yakov Pearlstein's head.

1285
01:10:14,176 --> 01:10:16,167
(laughs)

1286
01:10:16,212 --> 01:10:19,113
4-3, 4-3, I need a round-the-clock
security detail

1287
01:10:19,149 --> 01:10:23,414
on a patient Magulat,
M-A-gulat,

1288
01:10:23,453 --> 01:10:25,648
St. Luke's in the ICU.

1289
01:10:27,489 --> 01:10:31,358
#I wake up in the morning... #

1290
01:10:31,394 --> 01:10:34,658
Is this the number to call
to report a case of police brutality?

1291
01:10:34,697 --> 01:10:38,154
- Cat got your tongue?
- Out on bail again?

1292
01:10:38,201 --> 01:10:40,465
What, you think you can scare me,
little bitch? What do you want?

1293
01:10:40,502 --> 01:10:42,835
Be careful, detective.
My taxes pay your salary.

1294
01:10:42,872 --> 01:10:45,466
You don't pay any fucking taxes,
you lowlife piece of shit.

1295
01:10:45,507 --> 01:10:47,873
- Get to the point, come on.
- One of your vics, Trager,

1296
01:10:47,911 --> 01:10:50,538
stole a whole lot of guns
down South.

1297
01:10:50,579 --> 01:10:52,672
Same guns are turning up
on your murder scenes.

1298
01:10:52,715 --> 01:10:54,011
So it's simple...

1299
01:10:54,050 --> 01:10:56,574
find stolen guns,
you got your guy.

1300
01:10:56,618 --> 01:10:58,449
So you know the guy?

1301
01:10:58,488 --> 01:11:01,286
Do you know if there's a cop out there
who might be a danger to the public?

1302
01:11:01,323 --> 01:11:04,087
I couldn't live with myself
if I just stood by and didn't say anything.

1303
01:11:04,127 --> 01:11:07,118
Look, I'm gonna give you
two seconds more. Give me yes or no.

1304
01:11:07,162 --> 01:11:10,097
Do you know the guy?
And when do I meet you to talk about it?

1305
01:11:10,132 --> 01:11:12,863
Friday, 9:00 PM, at my club.

1306
01:11:12,902 --> 01:11:14,061
I'll be there.

1307
01:11:14,103 --> 01:11:16,127
Man, there's dumb
and there's dumber,

1308
01:11:16,171 --> 01:11:18,640
but this is the motherfucking dumbest
right here, man.

1309
01:11:18,675 --> 01:11:20,836
Easy, son, easy.
It's gonna be easy for you.

1310
01:11:20,877 --> 01:11:24,471
All you gotta do is be bait, that's all.
Be a little sardine for us, all right?

1311
01:11:24,514 --> 01:11:27,176
You help us... we got you covered.
Your club doesn't get hassled

1312
01:11:27,216 --> 01:11:29,742
and you don't have a revolving door
in and out of jail.

1313
01:11:29,786 --> 01:11:31,377
Do we have a deal or not?

1314
01:11:31,421 --> 01:11:34,822
Yeah, but your boy come in here
and go Hannibal Lecter on my ass,

1315
01:11:34,858 --> 01:11:37,382
I don't want no Jodie fucking Foster
coming through the door.

1316
01:11:37,426 --> 01:11:39,257
I want the goddamn
Marine Corps, man.

1317
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:42,923
#Since Color Me Badd was singing
"I wanna sex you up"...#

1318
01:11:46,435 --> 01:11:49,166
(footsteps)

1319
01:11:59,615 --> 01:12:01,640
(heart monitor beeping)

1320
01:12:11,961 --> 01:12:13,451
Evening, detective.

1321
01:12:13,496 --> 01:12:16,698
You want one? It's shit,
but it's better than nothing, right?

1322
01:12:16,698 --> 01:12:19,930
Turk's voice: As soon as I heard
the fucking Russian didn't die

1323
01:12:19,969 --> 01:12:22,233
I knew things would never
be the same.

1324
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:24,432
I had to change the rules,

1325
01:12:24,474 --> 01:12:26,465
the strategy.

1326
01:12:26,509 --> 01:12:30,274
I had to be bold, do something
that could never be undone.

1327
01:12:38,121 --> 01:12:40,422
I went for the unforgivable.

1328
01:13:01,610 --> 01:13:03,601
(Karen grunting)

1329
01:13:07,516 --> 01:13:10,212
No. Please. No.

1330
01:13:12,354 --> 01:13:14,788
(crying)

1331
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:35,108
Karen over phone: Did you hear
anything I just said?

1332
01:13:36,279 --> 01:13:40,010
How exactly could I be
blowing this out of proportion?

1333
01:13:40,048 --> 01:13:42,210
That psycho just assaulted me.

1334
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:45,550
I am telling you
he is a classic sociopath.

1335
01:13:45,587 --> 01:13:47,715
Okay okay,
I'll look into it, all right?

1336
01:13:47,756 --> 01:13:49,247
I'll look into it.

1337
01:13:49,292 --> 01:13:51,453
You stay the hell away from here.
Understood?

1338
01:13:51,493 --> 01:13:53,291
Understood?

1339
01:13:55,364 --> 01:13:56,695
Fuck that.

1340
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:10,408
Man: Check the ball,
check the ball.

1341
01:14:10,445 --> 01:14:11,878
(players chattering)

1342
01:14:11,913 --> 01:14:15,145
I got the ball. I got the ball. I got the ball.
Stay on him. Stay on him.

1343
01:14:15,184 --> 01:14:17,118
Karen: Excuse me,
I'm Detective Corelli.

1344
01:14:17,153 --> 01:14:20,087
- I need to see your reservation book.
- Woman: Sure. Help yourself.

1345
01:14:27,529 --> 01:14:29,760
- Thank you.
- Anytime.

1346
01:14:29,798 --> 01:14:31,493
Yes, this is Detective Corelli.

1347
01:14:31,533 --> 01:14:33,967
I've been trying to reach
Detectives Perez and Riley

1348
01:14:34,002 --> 01:14:35,936
and I can't seem
to locate them.

1349
01:14:35,971 --> 01:14:38,963
- Perez: I like to party.
- That's nothing. I was into Kiss.

1350
01:14:39,007 --> 01:14:40,998
I used to run
around the house

1351
01:14:41,043 --> 01:14:43,171
with my tongue hanging out,
spitting fake blood.

1352
01:14:43,212 --> 01:14:44,509
I need to speak to them
urgently.

1353
01:14:44,546 --> 01:14:46,742
(police siren whooping)

1354
01:14:48,350 --> 01:14:51,752
Yes, I understand,
but I need the location, please.

1355
01:15:15,811 --> 01:15:17,109
(buzzes)

1356
01:15:20,315 --> 01:15:22,806
Hey, he's here.

1357
01:15:22,851 --> 01:15:24,046
Turk: Let me in.

1358
01:15:29,524 --> 01:15:31,822
Thank God it's the police.

1359
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:34,193
Yeah, so where do we go?

1360
01:15:34,229 --> 01:15:36,163
Follow me.

1361
01:15:36,198 --> 01:15:38,497
I used to play ball
a couple of blocks from here.

1362
01:15:38,533 --> 01:15:39,761
Get the fuck out of here.

1363
01:15:39,801 --> 01:15:42,737
When I was a kid I wasn't afraid
to mix it up with guys like you.

1364
01:15:42,771 --> 01:15:44,069
You still ain't.

1365
01:15:44,106 --> 01:15:46,631
Yeah, nowadays
I carry a gun with me.

1366
01:15:46,676 --> 01:15:49,940
It's a bad neighborhood.

1367
01:15:49,979 --> 01:15:51,970
- It ain't bad for me.
- Yeah, well...

1368
01:15:52,014 --> 01:15:54,413
Yeah, he's inside.

1369
01:15:54,449 --> 01:15:56,007
Well, so far so good.

1370
01:15:56,051 --> 01:15:58,645
So now that we're done with
the pleasantries, what do you got for me?

1371
01:15:58,688 --> 01:15:59,916
Rooster: He's talking.

1372
01:15:59,956 --> 01:16:01,947
- What did you think he was gonna do?
- Spider: How about an apology?

1373
01:16:01,990 --> 01:16:04,755
Spider: The shit that happened to Stubby,
that wasn't supposed to happen.

1374
01:16:04,793 --> 01:16:08,320
- Rooster: Lieutenant, that's a crock of shit.
- I lost three fucking teeth that day.

1375
01:16:08,363 --> 01:16:10,627
He's not a civilian.
He's a fucking dealer.

1376
01:16:10,666 --> 01:16:12,725
- And I kept my mouth shut.
- So what?

1377
01:16:12,769 --> 01:16:16,068
You guys love those stupid gold teeth.
You should thank me.

1378
01:16:16,104 --> 01:16:18,938
Well, he's wearing a vest
and Starsky and Hutch here

1379
01:16:18,975 --> 01:16:22,001
are watching him like a couple
of hawks... gay hawks.

1380
01:16:22,043 --> 01:16:25,207
- Yeah, right there, buddy.
- (chuckles)

1381
01:16:25,247 --> 01:16:28,216
All right, enough bullshit.
So you know our poetry boy?

1382
01:16:28,251 --> 01:16:30,242
Just talk to me.
What do you got for me?

1383
01:16:30,286 --> 01:16:32,345
- All right, here we go.
- Here we go.

1384
01:16:32,387 --> 01:16:33,854
Would you please?

1385
01:16:33,890 --> 01:16:36,722
Just 'cause the guy's talking tough,
that don't mean shit.

1386
01:16:36,759 --> 01:16:38,555
Let me ask you something,
Copernicus.

1387
01:16:38,594 --> 01:16:41,188
That gun on his belt...
do you think it's a service pistol?

1388
01:16:41,229 --> 01:16:43,891
I bet you we'll trace it back to Trager's.
What do you think about that?

1389
01:16:43,932 --> 01:16:45,662
- What do you want to bet?
- 500 bucks.

1390
01:16:45,701 --> 01:16:47,828
- You're on.
- I'm in for another five.

1391
01:16:47,869 --> 01:16:50,235
Oh, this is fun.

1392
01:16:50,273 --> 01:16:52,467
Look, I help you,
you reciprocate.

1393
01:16:52,507 --> 01:16:53,975
So help me.

1394
01:16:54,010 --> 01:16:56,307
All right, you might see
a little bit of a cell-phone video.

1395
01:16:56,345 --> 01:16:58,404
I got it in front of Trager's
the night he bought it.

1396
01:16:58,447 --> 01:17:00,381
- You got what?
- I got a movie...

1397
01:17:00,416 --> 01:17:03,908
a couple of kids back from the prom,
preserving their special memories,

1398
01:17:03,953 --> 01:17:05,648
a positive ID of you, big time.

1399
01:17:05,688 --> 01:17:07,849
- Oh, yeah? Of me?
- Yeah.

1400
01:17:07,890 --> 01:17:09,618
Okay.

1401
01:17:09,658 --> 01:17:11,182
Now you know
what I'm talking about.

1402
01:17:11,226 --> 01:17:13,592
Yeah, now I got it.

1403
01:17:13,628 --> 01:17:15,563
Yeah, well,
so how do I look?

1404
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:20,192
Like a poet?

1405
01:17:21,203 --> 01:17:22,864
'Cause that's what I am,
you know, a poet.

1406
01:17:22,904 --> 01:17:25,600
All right, come on, let's go.

1407
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:28,269
In fact, I wrote a poem for you, Spider.
Want to hear it?

1408
01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:30,244
Eh?

1409
01:17:30,279 --> 01:17:32,509
(cocks gun)

1410
01:17:32,547 --> 01:17:34,072
(door crashes open)

1411
01:17:34,115 --> 01:17:37,608
Drop your gun right now, motherfucker!
Drop to the ground right now!

1412
01:17:37,653 --> 01:17:39,484
Oh! Oh! Grease me up and...

1413
01:17:39,521 --> 01:17:41,581
I mean, do they actually pay
you two morons?

1414
01:17:41,623 --> 01:17:44,889
- Put the fucking weapon on the ground.
- Gladly. Gladly. Right there.

1415
01:17:44,926 --> 01:17:46,895
Right there. There you go.

1416
01:17:48,064 --> 01:17:49,963
Hey, you want to read my poem?

1417
01:17:49,998 --> 01:17:51,431
Easy easy.

1418
01:17:51,466 --> 01:17:52,764
Here, read it.

1419
01:17:54,936 --> 01:17:57,201
"You tried to set me up, you fucks,

1420
01:17:57,239 --> 01:17:59,037
And this is how you do it?

1421
01:17:59,074 --> 01:18:01,805
You thought I'd get
my dick cut off,

1422
01:18:01,844 --> 01:18:04,404
Instead you only blew it."

1423
01:18:04,447 --> 01:18:06,471
- (both laugh)
- Great stuff.

1424
01:18:06,515 --> 01:18:08,881
- What is that shit?
- Thank you.

1425
01:18:08,917 --> 01:18:11,351
That is poetry.

1426
01:18:11,386 --> 01:18:13,115
What are you doing here?

1427
01:18:13,154 --> 01:18:14,985
Well, don't look at me, partner,

1428
01:18:15,024 --> 01:18:17,515
but I tagged along
to protect your ass

1429
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:20,893
and to see the look on their faces.
It was worth it.

1430
01:18:20,930 --> 01:18:23,296
We're doing our jobs here, okay?
I'm not gonna apologize for that.

1431
01:18:23,332 --> 01:18:25,960
I never want you to apologize, Teddy.
There's a killer out there with a badge.

1432
01:18:26,002 --> 01:18:28,162
- What are you morons doing about it?
- What do you think we're doing here?

1433
01:18:28,203 --> 01:18:30,069
- That's not it.
- No, that's not it.

1434
01:18:30,105 --> 01:18:32,006
I just made 1000 bucks.

1435
01:18:32,041 --> 01:18:33,905
Where's the other gun?
Give it to me.

1436
01:18:33,943 --> 01:18:35,739
Why don't you frisk me, Sherlock?
Go ahead.

1437
01:18:35,778 --> 01:18:37,972
- Frisk me, go ahead. Go ahead.
- Yeah, I'm gonna frisk you.

1438
01:18:41,050 --> 01:18:43,712
Ooh, nice touch, Mary.

1439
01:18:43,752 --> 01:18:45,913
What are you doing after work?
Unless you're committed.

1440
01:18:45,954 --> 01:18:48,185
I don't want to get
in the middle of anything.

1441
01:18:48,224 --> 01:18:51,454
What happened to your face?
Your mick friend give you a little love bite?

1442
01:18:51,493 --> 01:18:54,860
- Shut the fuck up. Shut your fucking face.
- Hey hey hey! Whoa!

1443
01:18:54,896 --> 01:18:57,627
I'll blow your brains out
if you don't get the fuck away.

1444
01:18:57,667 --> 01:18:59,828
- What's he talking about?
- (all yelling)

1445
01:18:59,868 --> 01:19:01,666
- What's he talking about?
- What he's talking about is,

1446
01:19:01,703 --> 01:19:04,036
just 'cause you didn't go for this
doesn't mean you're not our guy.

1447
01:19:04,073 --> 01:19:06,439
- Now we gotta break this shit up.
- Don't translate for me, man.

1448
01:19:06,475 --> 01:19:09,103
Rooster: Will you let this go?
You fucked up, okay?

1449
01:19:09,145 --> 01:19:11,670
- We fucked up 'cause you helped him.
- I'm gonna nail your ass.

1450
01:19:11,713 --> 01:19:14,079
I'm not through with you, man.
Make a mistake.

1451
01:19:14,115 --> 01:19:16,106
Rooster: I'm gonna
break this stuff down, okay?

1452
01:19:16,152 --> 01:19:18,381
You fucking dog.

1453
01:19:19,921 --> 01:19:22,685
Relax, Spider.

1454
01:19:22,725 --> 01:19:25,056
Come on, let's have a drink.

1455
01:19:25,094 --> 01:19:28,654
I saw what I think
is a refrigerator here.

1456
01:19:32,868 --> 01:19:34,529
I'll be back in a second.

1457
01:19:43,479 --> 01:19:44,969
Hey, muffinhead.

1458
01:19:48,184 --> 01:19:49,650
Is this the person
who shot you?

1459
01:19:50,653 --> 01:19:52,587
You're sure?

1460
01:19:56,292 --> 01:19:58,283
(chuckles)

1461
01:19:58,327 --> 01:20:00,351
No, you're the pumpkinhead.

1462
01:20:05,701 --> 01:20:07,692
(Spider chuckling)

1463
01:20:11,606 --> 01:20:13,574
You miss me?

1464
01:20:15,610 --> 01:20:17,943
"...of death and pain,

1465
01:20:17,979 --> 01:20:20,140
Place oneself among the slain.

1466
01:20:20,181 --> 01:20:22,707
If one addiction goes unfed,

1467
01:20:22,752 --> 01:20:25,050
The world is better with him dead."

1468
01:20:43,639 --> 01:20:44,867
Take it easy.

1469
01:20:44,907 --> 01:20:46,670
It's okay.
It's gonna be all right.

1470
01:20:46,708 --> 01:20:48,939
Jesus Christ, Rooster.

1471
01:20:48,978 --> 01:20:51,845
Just move into the room. Here.

1472
01:20:51,881 --> 01:20:54,349
Sit down. Sit down.

1473
01:20:57,252 --> 01:20:59,243
Okay.

1474
01:20:59,287 --> 01:21:02,984
You gotta know about this,
Tom, from me.

1475
01:21:03,024 --> 01:21:06,118
Now just open that little book,
start reading.

1476
01:21:06,162 --> 01:21:08,630
Everything you want to know
is in there.

1477
01:21:10,666 --> 01:21:12,657
So go ahead.

1478
01:21:14,235 --> 01:21:16,226
Out loud.

1479
01:21:17,573 --> 01:21:19,666
For the record.

1480
01:21:19,707 --> 01:21:22,471
See the little video here?

1481
01:21:28,884 --> 01:21:32,251
"My name is David Fisk,
Detective First Grade.

1482
01:21:32,287 --> 01:21:36,349
I've been a cop in the NYPD
for nearly 30 years."

1483
01:21:37,460 --> 01:21:40,987
- Dave, Dave, Dave, Dave.
- Tom,

1484
01:21:41,029 --> 01:21:44,123
we've got a lot to cover
and not much time to do it in, so...

1485
01:21:47,403 --> 01:21:50,600
"My name is David Fisk,
Detective First Grade."

1486
01:21:50,639 --> 01:21:53,163
My name is David Fisk.

1487
01:21:53,208 --> 01:21:56,234
"I've been a cop in the NYPD
for nearly 30 years."

1488
01:21:56,278 --> 01:21:59,145
I don't expect you
to remember me.

1489
01:21:59,180 --> 01:22:01,206
I mean, it's been a long time

1490
01:22:01,250 --> 01:22:05,050
since you sat me on your lap
and told me you loved me.

1491
01:22:05,087 --> 01:22:08,146
"In that time

1492
01:22:08,189 --> 01:22:10,920
I've killed 14 people."

1493
01:22:12,027 --> 01:22:14,018
Rooster: But I guarantee

1494
01:22:14,063 --> 01:22:17,225
you're gonna remember the name
for the rest of your life.

1495
01:22:27,743 --> 01:22:31,337
"You don't become a cop
because you want to serve and protect.

1496
01:22:32,780 --> 01:22:35,841
You join the force because they let you
carry a gun and a badge.

1497
01:22:35,885 --> 01:22:38,546
Most people respect the badge.

1498
01:22:38,587 --> 01:22:40,680
Everybody respects the gun."

1499
01:22:40,722 --> 01:22:43,555
I'm the killer.
I show up at your door.

1500
01:22:43,591 --> 01:22:46,425
Turk: What are you talking about?
It's not a fucking chess game.

1501
01:22:46,462 --> 01:22:49,555
Who knows? Maybe it is.
You're making all the wrong moves.

1502
01:22:49,597 --> 01:22:51,792
I'm gonna put two
through his fucking head

1503
01:22:51,833 --> 01:22:54,166
myself.

1504
01:22:54,203 --> 01:22:56,363
I know it to a moral certainty.

1505
01:22:56,404 --> 01:22:58,930
You sort of get numb to it.

1506
01:23:08,484 --> 01:23:11,213
"Tom Cowen was my role model.

1507
01:23:21,296 --> 01:23:23,595
The day I stopped trying to be him

1508
01:23:23,631 --> 01:23:25,963
was the greatest day of my life.

1509
01:23:30,005 --> 01:23:33,304
Several years back I framed
a lowlife child killer

1510
01:23:33,341 --> 01:23:36,003
named Charles Randall.

1511
01:23:37,779 --> 01:23:40,180
I should have known
it would come back to haunt me."

1512
01:23:44,386 --> 01:23:46,752
What do you want me
to do with this?

1513
01:23:48,556 --> 01:23:50,990
Is that all you got to say?

1514
01:23:51,025 --> 01:23:53,256
I owe you this explanation, pal.

1515
01:23:53,295 --> 01:23:55,319
Why are you telling me now?

1516
01:23:55,363 --> 01:23:59,698
Ivan the Terrible
is gonna wake up pretty soon

1517
01:23:59,734 --> 01:24:01,532
and he's gonna ID me.

1518
01:24:07,109 --> 01:24:08,939
Evening, detective.

1519
01:24:08,978 --> 01:24:11,947
You want one? It's shit,
but it's better than nothing, right?

1520
01:24:11,980 --> 01:24:16,145
I can just walk right in here.
Your partner's asleep. Step outside.

1521
01:24:16,185 --> 01:24:19,018
Did I ever pick
the wrong fucking Russki to shoot?

1522
01:24:28,396 --> 01:24:30,796
Now we're going off the record.

1523
01:24:33,335 --> 01:24:37,135
Uh, I'm going to take the rap
for the Randall gun thing.

1524
01:24:37,171 --> 01:24:39,002
You saw that.

1525
01:24:39,041 --> 01:24:42,203
I mean, considering
the circumstances, why not?

1526
01:24:42,243 --> 01:24:44,712
No need to thank me.

1527
01:24:45,913 --> 01:24:47,847
That business about not being me...

1528
01:24:47,882 --> 01:24:49,372
Yeah.

1529
01:24:49,417 --> 01:24:51,386
I don't get that.

1530
01:24:51,420 --> 01:24:55,412
Well, you're a great cop, Tom.

1531
01:24:55,457 --> 01:24:57,448
I mean, you were the one

1532
01:24:57,493 --> 01:25:00,552
I aspired to all my life
and could never be.

1533
01:25:02,131 --> 01:25:04,530
Then you broke the law,

1534
01:25:04,565 --> 01:25:07,729
planted the gun on Randall,

1535
01:25:07,770 --> 01:25:11,034
let me down.

1536
01:25:12,774 --> 01:25:14,708
I lost my faith.

1537
01:25:16,278 --> 01:25:20,237
That's when it all started.

1538
01:25:20,282 --> 01:25:22,944
And once it did,

1539
01:25:22,984 --> 01:25:25,010
I couldn't stop.

1540
01:25:26,387 --> 01:25:30,085
Finally,

1541
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:32,615
I didn't want to.

1542
01:25:39,033 --> 01:25:42,595
So I did my own thing.

1543
01:25:42,637 --> 01:25:45,231
And you know what? In the end

1544
01:25:45,274 --> 01:25:47,572
it got done.

1545
01:25:47,609 --> 01:25:50,134
The scum went down.

1546
01:25:50,179 --> 01:25:52,043
And that's it. That's that.

1547
01:25:53,582 --> 01:25:55,880
I don't understand
a word you said,

1548
01:25:55,917 --> 01:25:58,078
- don't understand any of it.
- I know you don't, Tom.

1549
01:25:58,119 --> 01:26:00,815
As soon as I heard
the Russian didn't die

1550
01:26:00,855 --> 01:26:03,221
I knew I had to change the rules,

1551
01:26:03,257 --> 01:26:06,091
do something that could
never be undone.

1552
01:26:06,127 --> 01:26:08,186
I went for the unforgivable.

1553
01:26:11,899 --> 01:26:13,423
No.

1554
01:26:14,903 --> 01:26:17,167
So what am I gonna do, my friend,

1555
01:26:17,206 --> 01:26:19,833
partner? Arrest you?

1556
01:26:19,875 --> 01:26:22,742
At some point I gotta call it in.

1557
01:26:22,778 --> 01:26:24,176
We're a team.

1558
01:26:24,212 --> 01:26:25,908
We were.

1559
01:26:25,948 --> 01:26:27,939
Yeah, we were, a great team.

1560
01:26:27,983 --> 01:26:30,474
That was yesterday, Dave.

1561
01:26:30,519 --> 01:26:31,645
Today...

1562
01:26:33,756 --> 01:26:36,725
today you're pointing a gun at me.

1563
01:26:41,162 --> 01:26:44,291
(cocks gun)
But it hasn't gone off yet.

1564
01:26:49,671 --> 01:26:51,161
Bye, Tom.

1565
01:26:51,206 --> 01:26:53,298
- Where are you going?
- I don't know.

1566
01:26:53,341 --> 01:26:56,345
To hell, I suppose.

1567
01:27:43,024 --> 01:27:45,050
- Hey, Dave, Dave.
- Whoa.

1568
01:27:45,092 --> 01:27:47,653
Don't come closer!

1569
01:27:47,695 --> 01:27:50,028
- You wouldn't.
- You want to bet your life on it?

1570
01:27:50,064 --> 01:27:52,033
Come on, partner, I know you.
You wouldn't.

1571
01:27:52,067 --> 01:27:54,432
(Karen cocks gun)
But I would.

1572
01:27:54,470 --> 01:27:55,698
Oh.

1573
01:27:55,737 --> 01:27:57,728
Karen, just take it easy.

1574
01:27:57,773 --> 01:27:59,797
- Can't get me out of your mind?
- Shut up, Dave.

1575
01:27:59,841 --> 01:28:03,868
You're gonna defend
this lowlife piece of shit?

1576
01:28:03,912 --> 01:28:06,846
- Boy, I'm in your head.
- I'm not defending him. Take it easy.

1577
01:28:06,881 --> 01:28:10,045
Fuck you, Turk.
Put the gun down, Fisk.

1578
01:28:10,085 --> 01:28:11,551
- And if I don't?
- Dave.

1579
01:28:11,587 --> 01:28:14,350
- How about I blow your brains out?
- Ooh, I like the sound of that.

1580
01:28:14,389 --> 01:28:16,323
- Don't move.
- Karen.

1581
01:28:16,358 --> 01:28:18,757
You blow me away, Turk dies.
Is that your idea?

1582
01:28:18,793 --> 01:28:20,125
I said don't move, you prick.

1583
01:28:20,162 --> 01:28:22,460
Bye-bye!

1584
01:28:24,131 --> 01:28:25,724
Give me the gun.
Give me the gun.

1585
01:28:27,402 --> 01:28:29,096
Stay here.

1586
01:28:35,877 --> 01:28:37,277
Oh, man.

1587
01:28:38,613 --> 01:28:39,876
Fuck.

1588
01:28:41,416 --> 01:28:43,315
- (train passing)
- These old locks...

1589
01:28:43,351 --> 01:28:45,046
I mean, they're good.

1590
01:28:45,087 --> 01:28:47,055
Dave, you've got to end
this thing.

1591
01:28:47,088 --> 01:28:49,148
End it?

1592
01:28:49,190 --> 01:28:50,488
Put the gun down.

1593
01:28:50,525 --> 01:28:53,323
What's your plan?

1594
01:28:53,362 --> 01:28:55,659
Are you gonna arrest me?

1595
01:28:55,697 --> 01:28:58,529
Are you gonna take me down
to the precinct, book me,

1596
01:28:58,567 --> 01:29:02,229
fingerprint me,
body-cavity-search me?

1597
01:29:02,270 --> 01:29:04,136
What the fuck
are you gonna do?

1598
01:29:04,171 --> 01:29:07,106
Wheel me out on the "Geraldo" show,
a freak of the week?

1599
01:29:07,141 --> 01:29:11,841
Or better yet, an in-depth
psycho profile on "Oprah"?

1600
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:14,177
Are you ready for that?
It ain't gonna fly, man.

1601
01:29:14,216 --> 01:29:16,582
Dave, you give me no choice.

1602
01:29:16,618 --> 01:29:18,448
You got a choice... I escape.

1603
01:29:20,021 --> 01:29:22,286
Would you do that for me, Tom?

1604
01:29:23,391 --> 01:29:24,619
Would you let me escape?

1605
01:29:24,659 --> 01:29:26,184
Come on, don't do this.

1606
01:29:26,228 --> 01:29:28,560
I'm gonna make a run for it.

1607
01:29:28,596 --> 01:29:30,792
What do you think?

1608
01:29:30,832 --> 01:29:33,823
You gotta do the right thing.

1609
01:29:39,841 --> 01:29:41,899
That's a 10-10, partner...

1610
01:29:41,944 --> 01:29:45,310
shots fired, suspect fleeing.
Let's go!

1611
01:29:45,346 --> 01:29:46,974
Come on, don't go there.

1612
01:29:48,483 --> 01:29:51,542
Hey, partner, come on.
Shots fired.

1613
01:29:51,587 --> 01:29:54,020
- Don't do this.
- Suspect fleeing,

1614
01:29:54,055 --> 01:29:56,489
resisting arrest. Come on.

1615
01:30:05,900 --> 01:30:08,801
A righteous man

1616
01:30:08,837 --> 01:30:11,567
Before me stands,

1617
01:30:11,606 --> 01:30:15,975
A hero in these filthy lands.

1618
01:30:16,011 --> 01:30:19,412
A brother in arms,

1619
01:30:19,448 --> 01:30:22,905
In heart are you.

1620
01:30:22,951 --> 01:30:25,613
I was really hoping

1621
01:30:25,654 --> 01:30:28,315
You'd get it too.

1622
01:30:31,792 --> 01:30:34,353
- I do get it.
- No, you don't.

1623
01:30:34,395 --> 01:30:36,329
No, I get it.

1624
01:30:42,671 --> 01:30:45,935
You know, the only thing
in this life

1625
01:30:45,974 --> 01:30:48,806
that ever gave me
any satisfaction

1626
01:30:48,844 --> 01:30:50,743
was killing those fucks.

1627
01:30:52,680 --> 01:30:55,012
So this is for real.

1628
01:30:55,050 --> 01:30:57,416
I mean,

1629
01:30:57,452 --> 01:30:59,783
this one is bad.

1630
01:31:01,957 --> 01:31:03,583
10-13.

1631
01:31:04,592 --> 01:31:06,787
Officer down.

1632
01:31:06,828 --> 01:31:09,694
(train passing)

1633
01:31:30,418 --> 01:31:33,479
I ain't going anywhere, Tom.

1634
01:31:33,521 --> 01:31:35,819
I ain't going anywhere.

1635
01:31:36,957 --> 01:31:39,791
It's okay.

1636
01:31:45,100 --> 01:31:47,829
3-4 squad, Central.
3-4 squad, Central.

1637
01:31:47,868 --> 01:31:50,359
10-13, officer down.
184th and St. Nick's.

1638
01:31:50,404 --> 01:31:53,135
Officer down, 10-13.
Hurry hurry hurry.

1639
01:31:53,175 --> 01:31:55,837
- Dispatcher: 10-4, 4 squad...
- Tom, don't. Don't.

1640
01:31:55,877 --> 01:31:59,438
- Officer down. ETA six minutes.
- Don't.

1641
01:31:59,480 --> 01:32:02,109
Don't.

1642
01:32:14,328 --> 01:32:16,354
Don't.

1643
01:32:24,805 --> 01:32:26,899
3-4 squad, Central.

1644
01:32:26,942 --> 01:32:29,536
Dispatcher: Central.
Go ahead, 4 squad.

1645
01:32:29,578 --> 01:32:32,103
That's a 10-55 on the bus.
Cancel the ambulance.

1646
01:32:32,146 --> 01:32:34,137
Dispatcher: 10-5?

1647
01:32:34,181 --> 01:32:37,242
Turk: Cancel the ambulance.
10-55 on the bus. Cancel the ambulance.

1648
01:32:37,284 --> 01:32:39,947
- You sure on that?
- Sure on that.

1649
01:32:49,096 --> 01:32:51,462
You did this, you know.

1650
01:32:53,033 --> 01:32:56,492
I know, partner, I know.

1651
01:32:59,640 --> 01:33:01,471
We did good, Tom.

1652
01:33:02,711 --> 01:33:05,145
Tom, Tommy.

1653
01:33:05,180 --> 01:33:08,911
We did good. We did good.

1654
01:33:10,618 --> 01:33:13,349
You're a good man, Tom.

1655
01:33:13,387 --> 01:33:15,822
You're a good man.

1656
01:33:17,192 --> 01:33:20,217
I wish you...

1657
01:33:20,261 --> 01:33:22,560
I wish you

1658
01:33:22,596 --> 01:33:25,690
continued success.

1659
01:34:07,408 --> 01:34:09,569
Some piece of work, your partner.

1660
01:34:09,610 --> 01:34:11,601
Lights.

1661
01:34:11,645 --> 01:34:13,443
Look, Cowen,

1662
01:34:13,480 --> 01:34:16,143
the way we see it,

1663
01:34:16,184 --> 01:34:19,153
Detective Fisk just closed the door
on the poetry boy.

1664
01:34:26,094 --> 01:34:29,256
Good. Whatever you say.

1665
01:34:32,100 --> 01:34:34,568
Are we done?

1666
01:34:34,603 --> 01:34:36,627
Yeah, we're done.

1667
01:34:42,476 --> 01:34:44,637
(children playing)

1668
01:34:58,726 --> 01:35:00,557
Turk's voice: My daughter called.

1669
01:35:00,595 --> 01:35:04,257
She was upset about Rooster
and worried about me.

1670
01:35:04,298 --> 01:35:07,859
She asked me if I was likely
to do something stupid

1671
01:35:07,903 --> 01:35:10,462
and I said, "Like what,

1672
01:35:10,505 --> 01:35:13,530
take anger management classes
or retire?"

1673
01:35:13,574 --> 01:35:16,840
I said I was gonna do
the same old thing I always do.

1674
01:35:16,877 --> 01:35:20,779
She said, "Good.
What else could you do?"

1675
01:35:20,814 --> 01:35:22,475
I said, "Right."

1676
01:35:22,516 --> 01:35:25,542
A real chip off the old block,
my daughter.

1677
01:35:25,587 --> 01:35:28,818
She said I was a cop
and a good one.

1678
01:35:28,856 --> 01:35:32,417
Funny... Rooster said
the same thing.

1679
01:35:35,529 --> 01:35:38,795
Turk: Okay, guys,
let's get ready to play ball.

1680
01:35:38,832 --> 01:35:42,667
On the count of three.
Everybody in?

1681
01:35:42,703 --> 01:35:46,265
One, two, three, explosion!

1682
01:35:58,953 --> 01:36:00,951
(instrumental music playing)
