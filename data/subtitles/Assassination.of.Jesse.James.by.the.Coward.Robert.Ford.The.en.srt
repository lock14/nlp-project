1
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:13,614
He was growing into middle age...

2
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:17,326
...and was living then in a bungalow
on Woodland Avenue.

3
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:21,413
He installed himself in a rocking chair...

4
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,665
...and smoked a cigar down
in the evenings...

5
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:26,752
...as his wife wiped her pink hands
on an apron...

6
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,089
...and reported happily
on their two children.

7
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:37,596
His children knew his legs...

8
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:41,100
...the sting of his mustache
against their cheeks.

9
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:47,106
They didn't know how their father made
his living or why they so often moved.

10
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:50,734
They didn't even know
their father's name.

11
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:56,907
He was listed in the city directory
as Thomas Howard.

12
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,535
And he went everywhere unrecognized...

13
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:02,746
...and lunched with Kansas City
shopkeepers and merchants...

14
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:06,291
...calling himself a cattleman
or a commodities investor...

15
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,754
...someone rich and leisured
who had the common touch.

16
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:17,302
He had two incompletely healed
bullet holes in his chest...

17
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,054
...and another in his thigh.

18
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:21,723
He was missing the nub
of his left middle finger...

19
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:25,144
...and was cautious,
lest that mutilation be seen.

20
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:30,649
He also had a condition that was
referred to as "granulated eyelids"...

21
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,819
...and it caused him
to blink more than usual...

22
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:38,740
...as if he found creation
slightly more than he could accept.

23
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:42,911
Rooms seemed hotter
when he was in them.

24
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:45,122
Rains fell straighter.

25
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:47,082
Clocks slowed.

26
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,002
Sounds were amplified.

27
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:53,922
He considered himself
a Southern loyalist and guerrilla...

28
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:57,050
...in a Civil War that never ended.

29
00:02:57,218 --> 00:03:02,598
He regretted neither his robberies,
nor the 17 murders that he laid claim to.

30
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:13,317
He had seen another summer under
in Kansas City, Missouri...

31
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:17,779
...and on September 5th
in the year 1881...

32
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:21,617
...he was 34 years old.

33
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:32,294
You just-- You just slide them things
right in there, right in your sleeve...

34
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:35,505
...and then, when you get ready,
you just shake it out.

35
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:38,008
Like that, right there. You shake it out.

36
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:45,557
Mary Todd Lincoln, tyrant's wife, fall
into hysterics when the moon was full.

37
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,310
President's men would tie her up
with hay-baling wire...

38
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:50,646
...keep her from ripping
her husband's ears off.

39
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:55,317
You never heard word one about the wife of
the Confederacy's Jefferson Davis, did you?

40
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:56,818
- I didn't.
- No, you didn't.

41
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,905
He did his duty by her.

42
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:04,826
- Oh, my God, I'm speaking to children.
- No, I get it, I get it, I get it.

43
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:09,164
The president of the Confederacy discerned
his wife's needs and satisfied them...

44
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:14,002
...with the utmost skill
and the utmost courtesy.

45
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:19,258
- Charley, you spit all over my boot.
- Sorry. Sorry, sorry, Jesse.

46
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:22,386
- Here, get it off.
- I'll wipe it-- I'll wipe it off.

47
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:26,932
But Abraham Lincoln probably sent his wife
on a shopping expedition.

48
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,852
- A three-act play.
- With money stole from us.

49
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,855
Chow!

50
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:39,695
I think insanity run on both sides
of that Lincoln family.

51
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:41,780
You're right about that.

52
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,533
The river-- You jump in the river.

53
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:50,080
- Chow!
- Don't be shy now, Dick.

54
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:52,708
- One more piece of meat.
- When you diddle a lot...

55
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:55,377
There's a good piece of bacon fat
in there for him.

56
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,331
Excuse me.

57
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:36,460
I see I've traipsed right on in
and interrupted you.

58
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:40,505
Who are you, then?

59
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:43,008
Bob Ford.

60
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:45,635
Charley's brother?

61
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:48,513
Yeah.

62
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:05,864
I was lying when I said
I just happened down here.

63
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:10,285
I've been looking for you. I feel lousy
I didn't say so at the outset.

64
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,456
Folks take me for a nincompoop...

65
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:18,377
...on account of the shabby first impression
I make, whereas I think of myself...

66
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,962
...as being just a rung down
from the James brothers.

67
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:24,800
I was hoping if I ran into you
aside from those peckerwoods...

68
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:29,054
...I could show you how special I am.

69
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:44,486
I honestly believe I'm destined
for great things, Mr. James.

70
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:48,990
I got qualities that don't come shining
through right at the outset.

71
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:54,830
You give me a chance, I'll get
the job done. I guarantee you that.

72
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,337
Hey, Dick, is it true you diddled a squaw?

73
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:08,844
Come on, you can tell me. I've always
wanted to lay down with a redskin.

74
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:10,846
Well, Charley...

75
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:15,725
...there's a feeling that comes over you...

76
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:19,563
...getting inside a woman whose hands
has scalped a congregation.

77
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:22,566
There's this thunderous sound
that comes from their cooch...

78
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:26,027
...on account of the fact that
they birth a child standing upright...

79
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:29,197
-...like a wild animal.
- What's it sound like?

80
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:33,618
Whatever a thunderous cooch sounds like
there, Charley. I don't know.

81
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:35,620
No.

82
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:38,206
They got a noisy quim
on account of the fact that...

83
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:43,253
...they use their cunnis as a saddlebag
to carry sundries across the plains.

84
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,340
Come on, what'd it really feel like?
Did it feel good?

85
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:49,885
Come on, fess up, now.

86
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:51,970
I like you, Charley.

87
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:55,557
I like you too, Charley.

88
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:57,058
Well...

89
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:01,062
You're not so special, Mr. Ford.

90
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:05,942
You're just like any other tyro
who's prinked himself up for an escapade.

91
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:09,946
Hoping to be a gunslinger
like them nickel books are about.

92
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:13,825
You may as well quench your mind of it...

93
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:18,079
...because you don't have
the ingredients, son.

94
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:35,639
Well, I'm sorry to hear
you feel that way...

95
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:39,017
...as I put such stock
in your opinions.

96
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:48,276
As for me being a gunslinger, I've just got
this one granddaddy Paterson Colt...

97
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:50,946
...and a borrowed belt to stick it in.

98
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:54,449
But I also got an appetite
for greater things.

99
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:01,706
I hoped by joining up with you, it'd put me
that much closer to getting them.

100
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:07,295
Well, what am I supposed to say to that?

101
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:11,341
Let me be your sidekick tonight.

102
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:12,634
Sidekick?

103
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,970
So you can examine my grit
and intelligence.

104
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:16,805
I don't know what it is about you...

105
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:20,058
...but the more you talk,
the more you give me the willies.

106
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:24,145
Now, I don't believe I want you anywhere
within earshot this evening, okay?

107
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:25,814
You understand?

108
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:33,321
- Well, I'm sorry--
- Why don't you just get now? Scat.

109
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:40,620
All right.

110
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:46,918
I was with a girl once, wasn't a squaw.

111
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,962
But she was pretty.

112
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:53,675
She had yellow hair like a...

113
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:57,262
Oh, like something.

114
00:09:57,513 --> 00:10:00,390
Like hair bobbed from a ray of sunlight?

115
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:03,518
Yeah. Yeah, like that.

116
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:06,855
Boy, you-- You talk good.

117
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:09,691
You can hide things in vocabulary.

118
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:16,239
Maybe you and me could write her a note,
send it by post?

119
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:18,116
See, all you gotta do, Ed...

120
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:21,578
...is predict her needs
and beat her to the punch.

121
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:27,542
Well, this girl, she has a real specific job.

122
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,629
- Specific?
- We was only together once.

123
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,047
She--

124
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:37,302
She was afraid of lightning,
and she came up under the wagon and...

125
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,388
...just cuddled right up to me.

126
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:42,557
She give me a kind price, too.

127
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,605
Well, I'll be. That is specific.

128
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,610
Yeah, sure,
she'd been with other people...

129
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:55,862
...but the kind of things she said to me...

130
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:59,157
...people just don't say
unless they really mean it.

131
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,410
My love said she would marry only me

132
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:06,289
And Jove himself could not make her care.

133
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:09,084
For what women say to lovers, you'll agree

134
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:13,338
One writes on running water or on air.

135
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:18,426
My God, that's good.
Let's write her that.

136
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:21,054
No.

137
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,765
Poetry don't work on whores.

138
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,937
How do you do?

139
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:33,441
Am I too late
to wish you a happy birthday?

140
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:37,278
How'd you know?

141
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:40,115
You'd be surprised
at what I got stored away.

142
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:42,867
I'm an authority on the James boys.

143
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,494
Is you?

144
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:50,750
Well-- Well, your brother Frank and I,
we just had a real nice visit.

145
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:55,088
Just chit-chatting about this and that,
right over there.

146
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:58,383
And must've been a hundred subjects
entertained--

147
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,927
Good Lord, you know
what this stew needs?

148
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:07,225
Dumplings?

149
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,144
Noodles.

150
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,897
You eat yourself some noodle stew
and your clock'll tick all night.

151
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:16,943
You ever see that woman up in Fayette?
Suck noodles up her nose.

152
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,488
- In Fayette?
- I don't believe I have.

153
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:22,991
You never heard of her, huh?

154
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:26,494
She got canals up there
you never dreamed of.

155
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,375
I don't like to harp on a subject--

156
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:35,170
I don't care who comes with me.
Never have.

157
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:37,922
That's why they call me gregarious.

158
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,552
I hear you and young Stovepipe here
had a real nice visit.

159
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:47,056
Your boys have got about a acre
of lumber to haul, dingus.

160
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,726
You better goose them down yonder.

161
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:04,199
The James Gang committed over 25 bank,
train and stagecoach robberies...

162
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:07,786
...from 1867 to 1881.

163
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:10,747
But except for Frank and Jesse James...

164
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:15,043
...all the original members
were now either dead or in prison.

165
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:20,048
--Mine eye
All my soul and all my every part

166
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:23,718
And for this sin, there is no remedy

167
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,222
It is so grounded inward in my heart.

168
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:29,724
So for their last robbery at Blue Cut...

169
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:33,478
...the brothers recruited a gang
of petty thieves and country rubes...

170
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,314
...culled from the local hillsides.

171
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:54,350
Right on schedule, Buck!

172
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:59,105
Snuff those lanterns!

173
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:03,067
Look at those fools. They're gonna trip
and shoot each other into females.

174
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:06,362
I bet you I could find them husbands
if they do.

175
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:52,969
Fan out!

176
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:58,433
Hold your fire!

177
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:02,603
- Watch him!
- Going down.

178
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:18,369
Hold your fire, you idiots!

179
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,622
Hold your fire!

180
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,468
Let me in.

181
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:36,012
Buck! Boys!

182
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,264
Buck, this way!

183
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:41,559
Do you think that lock will hold?

184
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:44,812
No, I don't.

185
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:47,231
Let's go, let's go.

186
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:02,830
Let's not get clever, nor courageous,
any of you.

187
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:18,429
Hey there, boys!
These all for me?

188
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,684
Looks like Christmas morning in here.

189
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,146
Hey, friend.

190
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:30,650
You mind if I have a peek around?

191
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:33,277
This shit. Nope.

192
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:36,364
Nope.

193
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:39,367
You got anything good here?

194
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:41,702
Could be.

195
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,386
Open that safe.

196
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:05,309
Do it!

197
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:11,899
- You didn't have to bop him.
- Yeah, he did. They needed convincing.

198
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:14,527
They got their company rules,
I got my mean streak...

199
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:17,196
...and that's how
we get things done around here.

200
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:21,993
- Get on over here and attend to this thing.
- Come on, go.

201
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:29,000
Hold your fire, you idiots!

202
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,252
Dig deeper.

203
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:36,174
- Come on!
- Give me your money.

204
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:39,260
- And you, stand up.
- Let's see your hands.

205
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,179
What have you got?

206
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,682
Speak English.

207
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:49,395
Money. Money. You understand that?

208
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:52,440
Give me your money!

209
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,784
There's some receipts.

210
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:07,413
I got fives.

211
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:11,417
Jesse. Jesse.

212
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,714
Don't look good.

213
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:25,306
There ain't no 100,000 dollars
in here, Dick.

214
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:35,775
Get down on your knees.

215
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:38,486
Why?

216
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,238
Well, you ought to pray.

217
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:42,615
I'm gonna kill you.

218
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:51,040
Get at!

219
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:55,670
You're gonna have to make me.

220
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,591
All right.

221
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:30,288
Don't shoot him! No, don't shoot him.

222
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:45,219
Don't tell me what I can
and cannot do, Ed.

223
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:51,017
Round them up!

224
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:17,918
Chicago newspaper publishers made
a great deal of the Blue Cut train robbery...

225
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:20,087
...alleging that in no state
but Missouri...

226
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:23,758
...would the James brothers be tolerated
for 12 years.

227
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,760
Hey.

228
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,513
Can you keep a secret?

229
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,267
It depends on what you're concealing.

230
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:36,771
You afraid of the dark?

231
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:39,190
No.

232
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:41,776
You superstitious?

233
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:49,158
I put-- I put an acorn in the window
to keep the lightning out.

234
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:42,336
Kid, you must've crept up on cat's paws.

235
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:46,674
I'll wager that's the first and last time
you'll ever be caught off-guard.

236
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,011
How old are you?

237
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:53,848
Twenty.

238
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:00,229
Except, well, I guess I won't
really be 20 till...

239
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,898
Till January, so...

240
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:05,609
I'm 19.

241
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:11,198
Yeah, you feel older than that, though,
don't you?

242
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:17,746
Yeah, I do.

243
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:35,055
Hey, Frank, you--
You think the sheriff's out already?

244
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:39,810
- More than likely.
- Yeah.

245
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:44,565
I had a real fine time tonight.

246
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:47,943
- You think so?
- Yup. Yeah.

247
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:51,280
Hey, I wasn't just flapping my lips
about my kid brother and me.

248
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:56,243
What I figured was if you and Jesse could
gauge our courage and our daring...

249
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:58,662
...you might just make us
your regular sidekicks.

250
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:01,081
Your courage and your daring.

251
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:07,421
I about heard all I want to about sidekicks.
You sound like your damn brother.

252
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:12,092
Yeah. Well, I'll be square with you,
it's Bob who put me up to it. He's--

253
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:15,930
He's got plans for the James boys
I can't even get the hang of.

254
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:17,932
- They're that complicated.
- Yeah?

255
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:21,644
Well, you can just
get shed of that idea.

256
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:24,355
Because after tonight,
there'll be no more shenanigans.

257
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:27,858
You can jot that down in your little diary.

258
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:32,780
September 7th, 1881, the James Gang
robbed one last train at Blue Cut...

259
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:35,449
...and gave up their nightriding for good.

260
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:43,624
Wait.

261
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,753
Well, how are you gonna
make your living?

262
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:55,094
Maybe I'll sell shoes.

263
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:06,981
I can't believe I woke up this morning...

264
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:10,484
...wondering if my daddy
would loan me his overcoat...

265
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:12,486
...and here it is just past midnight...

266
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:16,240
...I've already robbed a rail road train
and I'm sitting in a rocking chair...

267
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:18,659
...chatting with none other
than Jesse James.

268
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:21,996
Yeah, it's a wonderful world.

269
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:32,256
What's this?

270
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:34,174
Oh, yeah.

271
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:39,388
I was real agitated this morning, so I was
wondering if I would know you or Frank...

272
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:44,685
...tell you all apart, and so I had
this clipping that described you both.

273
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:46,937
Want me to read it?

274
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:48,689
Go on.

275
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:52,985
Well... I gotta find it. Hold on.

276
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:56,113
Here. Here.

277
00:26:56,281 --> 00:27:00,409
"Jesse James, the youngest, has a face
as smooth and innocent as a schoolgirl.

278
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:04,955
The blue eyes, very clear and penetrating,
are never at rest.

279
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:08,626
His form is tall and graceful
and capable of great endurance...

280
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:10,210
...and great effort.

281
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:14,381
Jesse is lighthearted, reckless,
and devil-may-care.

282
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:18,802
- There's always a smile on his lips--"
- All right, all right, all right.

283
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:22,765
Well, yeah, then it just-- Frank, Frank,
Frank. That's nothing. And then...

284
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:37,071
You know what I got
right next to my bed?

285
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:42,785
Is The Train Robbers, or, A Story
of the James Boys by R.W. Stevens.

286
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:45,913
I mean, many's the night I stayed up...

287
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:48,499
...with my eyes open
and my mouth open...

288
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:51,835
...just reading about your escapades
in the Wide Awake Library.

289
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:55,673
They're all lies, you know.

290
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:01,053
Yeah, of course they are.

291
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:07,518
You don't have to keep smoking that
if it's making you bungey.

292
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:33,794
Alexander Franklin James
would be in Baltimore...

293
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:37,631
...when he would read of
the assassination of Jesse James.

294
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:55,649
He had spurned his younger brother
for being peculiar and temperamental.

295
00:28:57,026 --> 00:29:00,320
But once he perceived
that he would never see Jesse again...

296
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:05,534
...Frank would be wrought-up,
perplexed, despondent.

297
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,534
My brother and me are hardly
on speaking terms these days.

298
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:51,205
Well, I wasn't gonna mention it.

299
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:03,175
Are you scared?

300
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:06,094
No, I'm just surprised a little.

301
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:08,847
They ain't as succulent as I like,
the devil to clean...

302
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:12,059
...but if a man skins them
and fries them in garlic and oil...

303
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:15,103
...mercy, them's good eating.

304
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:18,607
Well, I never been that hungry.

305
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:23,445
I give them names.

306
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:26,281
Such as?

307
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:31,495
Such as enemies.

308
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:35,249
I give them names of enemies.

309
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:51,056
Go tell Wood and Charley
to get their gatherings together.

310
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:54,059
All right.

311
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:57,020
Me too?

312
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:01,108
You can stay.

313
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:05,112
All right.

314
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:13,036
Hey.

315
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,958
- What do you want, peckerwood?
- Nothing.

316
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:20,794
Except to say Jesse wants
you two to gather your parts...

317
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:23,463
...get on your horses
and get out of town.

318
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:25,799
And me to stick around.

319
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:31,221
Well, whoa, I'm his cousin...

320
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:33,140
...I'll have you know.

321
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:35,475
My mama's his daddy's sister.

322
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:38,061
Is that how they described it to you,
Wood?

323
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,857
You better watch your tongue,
young sapling.

324
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:45,402
Why is it me who's gotta rattle his hocks
out of town and not you, Bunny?

325
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,321
Put your horns away.
If I know Jess...

326
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:50,699
...there's some real nasty
sad-suzie work's gotta be done...

327
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:53,994
...and Bob's the ninny that has to do it.

328
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:56,413
Oh, yeah, I'm sure that's it, Charley.

329
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:02,836
You only met him 12 hours ago.
He doesn't even know your name.

330
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:07,341
Wood! You tell your daddy
I'll be in Kentucky in October.

331
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,136
We can hunt some birds together.

332
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,096
All right.

333
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:17,351
So how come it's Bob who gets to stay?

334
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:22,940
Bob's gonna move my gear to a house
down the street.

335
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:25,025
See?

336
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:28,320
- I don't mind.
- Yeah, well.

337
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:30,572
Sounds like an adventure.

338
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:38,288
They moved to 1017 Troost Avenue
at night...

339
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:42,876
...so that the neighborhood couldn't get
a good look at them or their belongings.

340
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:47,297
Then Bob thought Jesse
would give him eight hours' sleep...

341
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:49,841
...and a daydreaming goodbye.

342
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:55,889
But with a second day
in the Thomas Howard house...

343
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:58,058
...Bob thought he might never go...

344
00:32:58,893 --> 00:33:02,729
...but might be brought in
as a good-natured cousin to the boy...

345
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:06,900
...and a gentleman helper to Zee.

346
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:11,697
He went everywhere with Jesse.

347
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:14,116
They made trips
to the Topeka Exchange Saloon...

348
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:18,078
...where Jesse could spend nearly
60 minutes sipping one glass of beer...

349
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:21,498
...and still complain about feeling tipsy.

350
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:25,168
Bob would rarely vouchsafe his opinions
as they talked.

351
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:28,880
If spoken to, he would fidget and grin.

352
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:33,677
If Jesse palavered with another person,
Bob secretaried their dialogue...

353
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:37,597
...getting each inflection,
reading every gesture and tic...

354
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:40,976
...as if he wanted to compose
a biography of the outlaw...

355
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:44,104
...or as if he were preparing
an impersonation.

356
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:01,872
Go away.

357
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:08,462
Used to be couldn't no one sneak up
on Jesse James.

358
00:34:09,797 --> 00:34:12,132
Now you think otherwise?

359
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:16,428
I ain't never seen you without your guns,
neither.

360
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:31,985
I can't figure it out.

361
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:35,072
Do you wanna be like me...

362
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:36,990
...or do you wanna be me?

363
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:45,165
I'm just making fun, is all.

364
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:51,088
Bob was sent away cordially
the next day...

365
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:52,756
...with a goodbye from Jesse...

366
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:56,843
...but nothing from Zee
beyond what good manners demanded.

367
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:03,266
It was 40 miles to his sister's farm
from Kansas City.

368
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:08,855
And it was well into the afternoon
by the time he arrived there.

369
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:13,902
Mrs. Martha Bolton rented
the Harbison farm in 1879...

370
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:16,655
...just after becoming a widow.

371
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:19,866
And she made a good income
by giving rooms and meals...

372
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:25,205
...to her brothers Charley, Wilbur and Bob,
and to members of the James Gang...

373
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:27,874
...who would appear
whenever they needed seclusion.

374
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:29,709
Dick! You're gonna make her sick!

375
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:32,879
She's gonna upchuck
if you don't watch out!

376
00:35:33,422 --> 00:35:36,633
Wood Hite had been spurned by Martha
in his affections...

377
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:39,511
...and his attempt to switch his pursuit
to her daughter...

378
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:41,555
...was being thwarted by Dick Liddil.

379
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:45,058
Wait a second, you assured me
that you were not ticklish.

380
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:46,226
Howdy!

381
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:48,228
What's going on, now?
What's going on--?

382
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:51,231
- Howdy!
- Were you fibbing about that?

383
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:53,233
- No.
- Not at all.

384
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:56,444
You're not supposed to peek, Dick.

385
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:59,072
Well, you're just so pretty
I can't help myself.

386
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,741
- You need to be warning him about that.
- Howdy.

387
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:05,829
Worry about the field instead,
might be able to worry about the work...

388
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,873
Howdy!

389
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:11,585
- Finally home.
- I'm so glad, Bob.

390
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:14,421
I'm in that room too, Bob.
Don't mess with my things.

391
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:16,631
All right, Grandpa.

392
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:28,059
"July 9th. Diligence, tact,
and a keen sense of responsibility...

393
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:32,606
...capacity for detail are your dominant
traits. Your sense of duty's strong."

394
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:18,568
How long you been there?

395
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:21,655
Just now arrived. Did I miss much?

396
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:26,826
Not unless you never seen a man
wash his dirty carcass before.

397
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:30,497
Boy, you got a big old pecker
for being such a little squirrel.

398
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:32,666
That what you come here to see, Dick?

399
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:36,002
No.

400
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:40,382
Your brother said that Jesse
kept you in Kansas City some extra days.

401
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:41,633
What was the reason?

402
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:47,722
Well, I'm not at liberty to say exactly.

403
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:53,687
Let me ask you this. Did Jesse mention
that me and Cummins were in cahoots?

404
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:56,022
Is that so?

405
00:37:56,190 --> 00:38:00,110
Oh, dear. I went on and said too much,
have I?

406
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:02,529
Well, who else is partners with you two?

407
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:09,411
See, he'll cut our throats if he finds out.
You don't know him like I do.

408
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:13,581
You do Jesse dirt,
you connive behind his back...

409
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:16,543
...boy, he'll come after you
with a cleaver.

410
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:21,756
So, what are you two cahoots
cooking up?

411
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,386
Don't know that I should say.

412
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:29,681
I'm not gonna wheedle
the dang news from you.

413
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:31,599
How about we'll leave it a mystery...

414
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:36,062
...and then we won't neither one of us
regret our little chat?

415
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:44,571
Can you hand me that six-gun there, Bob?

416
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:57,751
If you so much as mention my name
to Jesse...

417
00:38:57,918 --> 00:39:00,253
...boy, I'll find out about it.

418
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:03,423
You had better believe that.

419
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:05,633
And I'll look you up.

420
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:10,722
I'll knock on your door,
and I will be as mad as a hornet.

421
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:13,600
I will be hot.

422
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:18,271
You be careful with that iron, Dick.

423
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:30,200
You know where I stand on these matters
and that's all there is to it.

424
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:33,953
Me and you can be as friendly as pigs
from now on.

425
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,941
I'm Bunny Ford, stick your hands
up in the air!

426
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:04,818
Mister.

427
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:12,325
Oh, you have some nerve.

428
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:18,998
We were just reading about the James boys
among the Mexicans.

429
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:23,420
What's this? This ain't Jesse.

430
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:26,714
- You don't know that.
- He would've never wore no mustache.

431
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:29,259
Never was anywheres near a cannon.

432
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:31,845
Let me see that picture.

433
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:34,764
Boy, I can't even calculate
what I'm looking at.

434
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:37,142
- Give me that.
- Ever since he was a child...

435
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:40,520
...Bob's collected whatsoever he could find
about the James brothers.

436
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:42,856
Yeah, got himself a little museum
in his room.

437
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:46,651
Next time you come snooping around,
you better strap on a shooting iron!

438
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:49,696
Well, you can see how scared I am.

439
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:53,700
You too, Wood Hite. Cross me again,
I'll put a bullet through your head!

440
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:55,910
Boy, you--

441
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:59,247
Son, you better recollect
who my cousin is...

442
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:03,501
...because you've seemed to misremembered
that Jesse loves me like the Good Book.

443
00:41:03,669 --> 00:41:07,297
Now, you may play it like you're
a dangerous person in the grocery store...

444
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,883
...but don't misremember
who you be accounting to...

445
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:12,469
-...if I so much get my feelings hurt.
- I don't care!

446
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:14,220
Do I have to yell "suwee"?

447
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:16,347
Why don't we make up,
be pleasant for once?

448
00:41:16,515 --> 00:41:19,350
Why don't we pass the evening
like pleasant human beings?

449
00:41:19,518 --> 00:41:21,769
I like your nickel suit, cowboy.

450
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:49,380
You see something?

451
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:52,425
Just a bird.

452
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,097
The month of October came...

453
00:41:58,265 --> 00:42:01,684
...and Jesse began seeing
Pinkerton operatives in every floor walker...

454
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:06,272
...street sweeper, and common man
poking about in a store.

455
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:11,069
On the morning of the 11 th,
he would wake his wife...

456
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:15,448
...with the Scripture pertaining to
the Holy Family's flight into Egypt.

457
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:24,082
Overnight, the Thomas Howard clan
vanished from Kansas City.

458
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:37,220
Shortly thereafter,
four of the Blue Cut train robbers...

459
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:40,223
...were arrested in shacks near Glendale.

460
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:48,982
How Jesse could have known
remains a mystery.

461
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:03,997
Theirs was a wandering existence.

462
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:05,873
Men who choose to be outlaws...

463
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:10,003
...cannot afford to remain in one place
for very long.

464
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:23,308
- Goodness. Maybe I'll change my mind.
- Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

465
00:43:23,475 --> 00:43:25,685
- Martha.
- Buck up, man.

466
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:29,439
Wood and Dick would bicker
across the entire state of Kentucky...

467
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:34,569
...until they made Russellville, home
of Major George Hite, Wood's father...

468
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:37,864
...and uncle to Frank and Jesse James.

469
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:48,124
You stay away from this one.

470
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:50,918
She's my daddy's wife.

471
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:53,212
You got it?

472
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:18,738
Did you cook this, ma'am?

473
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:24,327
I've got a nigger woman.

474
00:44:26,413 --> 00:44:27,455
How's that?

475
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:35,254
Dick asked if I cooked this.

476
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:37,006
Did you?

477
00:44:39,593 --> 00:44:40,593
No.

478
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:52,271
She knew what he was like
when she married him.

479
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:23,010
I guess we're the night owls, you and I.

480
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:26,264
I'm glad.

481
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:29,976
How come?

482
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:33,604
You're interesting to look at.

483
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:37,984
You have a real pleasant disposition.

484
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:43,573
And I don't know, you sort of
make me feel warm all over.

485
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:50,246
You know, I'm what they call a--
An inamorato.

486
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:58,838
Well, I knew
there had to be a name for it.

487
00:46:02,676 --> 00:46:04,844
You and the Hites
don't get along too well...

488
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:08,264
...if I'm to trust Wood and his version
of the situation.

489
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:12,977
We hate each other like poison,
if you wanna know the truth.

490
00:46:13,645 --> 00:46:17,356
Most of the Hites wouldn't spit on me
if I was on fire.

491
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:22,361
They say that when a woman's on fire...

492
00:46:22,529 --> 00:46:26,991
...you're supposed to roll her around on
the ground and cover her with your body.

493
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:31,037
Well, you are a naughty tease.

494
00:46:37,586 --> 00:46:39,921
Isn't it about bedtime?

495
00:46:41,256 --> 00:46:44,133
Well, I'll just kiss those dainty nubbins.

496
00:46:58,065 --> 00:46:59,482
Good night.

497
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:15,039
Would you stop?

498
00:47:20,295 --> 00:47:24,340
Boy, I believe I drank too much coffee.

499
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:31,389
I gotta go visit the privy
something terrible.

500
00:48:00,669 --> 00:48:02,962
This is embarrassing.

501
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:07,717
Now, you go ahead and do your duty.
I don't mind.

502
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:12,972
I've sort of got stage fright with
a strange man in the commode with me.

503
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,640
I ain't strange.

504
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:17,852
I'm built just like the rest of them.

505
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:23,691
You look awful pretty.

506
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:26,861
Do I?

507
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:31,908
I haven't never in my life seen
such well-shaped limbs.

508
00:48:39,499 --> 00:48:41,626
Is Wood awake?

509
00:48:43,837 --> 00:48:45,129
It's just me.

510
00:48:53,972 --> 00:48:56,891
And I bet you thought I was a lady.

511
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:46,065
Well, you ain't much of a housekeeper,
are you?

512
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:51,070
You didn't just happen by.

513
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:55,199
Why not?

514
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:25,354
Go on and take a load off your feet.

515
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:52,465
You ought to get yourself a wife.

516
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:54,175
Yeah.

517
00:50:54,426 --> 00:50:56,260
I suppose.

518
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:02,850
I was gonna ask Martha. Charley's sister.

519
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:06,395
I was gonna ask her
if she could imagine it.

520
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:10,483
But I guess Wood has plans of his own.

521
00:51:11,109 --> 00:51:13,736
And there's always Dick Liddil
getting in the way.

522
00:51:14,821 --> 00:51:16,822
I'll give it some thought, though.

523
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:19,533
Your crops come in?

524
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:25,831
No, I don't got much.
Just a garden patch and a pasture.

525
00:51:28,126 --> 00:51:30,503
I was sick at planting time.

526
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:32,880
So...

527
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:37,426
Ed, how you feeling now?

528
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:41,347
Why?

529
00:51:43,225 --> 00:51:45,434
You're acting queer.

530
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:57,613
Well, you and me ain't been
just real good friends lately.

531
00:51:58,573 --> 00:52:01,700
That's not your fault,
you understand that.

532
00:52:04,037 --> 00:52:05,663
You hear talk, though.

533
00:52:07,707 --> 00:52:09,208
Talk?

534
00:52:13,004 --> 00:52:15,214
People tell you things.

535
00:52:22,764 --> 00:52:24,890
Why don't you give me an example?

536
00:52:29,187 --> 00:52:31,313
Jim Cummins come by here.

537
00:52:32,941 --> 00:52:34,275
Jim Cummins.

538
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:37,778
Oh, and Jim says:

539
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:44,034
"You know them boys
that got caught in the Blue Cut deal?"

540
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:50,749
Well, Jim says he got word...

541
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:57,464
...that you're planning to kill them.

542
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:01,594
Why would I do that?

543
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:05,639
That's just talk probably.

544
00:53:09,644 --> 00:53:13,480
Jim Cummins. He say anything else?

545
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:17,735
Nope. No, that was it, basically.

546
00:53:28,121 --> 00:53:30,539
That still don't explain why you're scared.

547
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:37,046
Well, I'm in the same situation, you see.

548
00:53:37,797 --> 00:53:39,798
I was terrified, I saw you ride up.

549
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:43,469
- I just happened by, Ed.
- Suppose you heard gossip, though.

550
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:46,555
Suppose you heard Jim Cummins
come by, you might have thought...

551
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:51,685
...that we were planning to capture you
or get that reward, and that ain't true.

552
00:53:51,853 --> 00:53:54,146
But you might have suspected it.

553
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:15,125
Haven't heard a lick of gossip lately.

554
00:54:15,293 --> 00:54:19,713
I got 600 dollars stashed away.
I don't need no governor's reward.

555
00:54:22,634 --> 00:54:24,551
Well, it's the principle too.

556
00:54:29,557 --> 00:54:31,058
Well...

557
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:34,853
- I'm glad I stopped by.
- Oh, me too.

558
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:02,715
What do you say
if we were to go for a ride?

559
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:10,556
We can go into town. I'll buy you dinner.

560
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:14,435
Then I'll be on my way.

561
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:25,154
Okay.

562
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:27,299
You ready to go for a ride?

563
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:45,484
We going to your place?

564
00:56:50,323 --> 00:56:52,449
You seen Ed Miller lately?

565
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:55,953
Nobody has.

566
00:56:59,749 --> 00:57:02,334
Must have gone off to California.

567
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:08,715
I'd still like to know where we're going.

568
00:57:13,888 --> 00:57:17,808
If you were going to see Jim Cummins,
wouldn't you follow this road?

569
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:25,065
I guess so.

570
00:58:08,026 --> 00:58:09,485
Howdy.

571
00:58:20,371 --> 00:58:22,498
Are you friends of my pa's?

572
00:58:27,587 --> 00:58:29,421
We're friends of Jim Cummins.

573
00:58:33,551 --> 00:58:36,428
Well, it so happens
he's been gone since August.

574
00:58:36,596 --> 00:58:38,680
And never said where he gone to.

575
00:58:43,603 --> 00:58:46,855
- I'm Matt Collins.
- Albert Ford.

576
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:48,941
Very happy to meet you.

577
00:58:54,656 --> 00:58:58,158
- Dick Turpin.
- Pleased to make your acquaintance.

578
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,881
I don't know where he is!
Leave me alone!

579
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:14,800
Shut your mouth!
You shut your mouth!

580
00:59:16,803 --> 00:59:19,638
- You shut your mouth.
- I don't know where he is!

581
00:59:20,348 --> 00:59:22,391
- I don't know!
- Get in there.

582
00:59:23,268 --> 00:59:24,309
Shut up.

583
00:59:24,477 --> 00:59:26,979
- I don't know where he is!
- Shut up.

584
00:59:28,022 --> 00:59:29,481
- I don't know!
- Shut up.

585
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:30,732
- Jesus.
- Shut up.

586
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:32,985
Jesse, he's just a kid.

587
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:37,072
He knows where his uncle Jim is and
that's gonna make him old soon enough.

588
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,533
- Maybe he doesn't know.
- He knows!

589
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:41,368
You need to ask and ask sometimes.

590
00:59:41,536 --> 00:59:45,163
Sometimes a child don't remember so much
at first. But it'll come back to him.

591
00:59:47,208 --> 00:59:49,751
My goodness, she's about to rip off,
sweetie.

592
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:51,920
Just a little more here to get her started.

593
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:54,840
Then I think I can rip her off
like a page from a book.

594
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:57,134
Jesus, he can't even talk.

595
00:59:59,971 --> 01:00:03,181
Where's Jim?

596
01:00:03,349 --> 01:00:05,309
Where's Jim? Where's Jim?

597
01:00:05,476 --> 01:00:08,854
Where's Jim? Where's Jim? Where's Jim?

598
01:00:09,188 --> 01:00:11,440
- Where's Jim?
- Quit it!

599
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:14,359
You bastard! I don't know where he is!

600
01:00:14,527 --> 01:00:17,362
You won't believe me!
You never even gave me a chance!

601
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:19,531
You kept my-- You kept my mouth shut!

602
01:00:20,908 --> 01:00:24,328
I never know where Jim is or
when he comes! So leave me alone.

603
01:00:24,495 --> 01:00:26,913
Get off me, you son of a bitch!

604
01:01:19,967 --> 01:01:21,927
I'm worn out.

605
01:01:22,136 --> 01:01:25,013
I can't. No, see...

606
01:01:28,059 --> 01:01:30,602
My mind's all tangled anyway.

607
01:01:31,145 --> 01:01:34,606
Little deals like this
just make me feel dirty.

608
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:57,713
Are you all right, Jesse?

609
01:02:26,284 --> 01:02:28,118
Jesse was sick...

610
01:02:28,286 --> 01:02:32,748
...with rheums, and aches
and lung congestions.

611
01:02:33,624 --> 01:02:36,918
Insomnia stained
his eye sockets like soot.

612
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:40,756
He read auguries in
the snarled intestines of chickens...

613
01:02:41,966 --> 01:02:45,510
...or the blow of cat hair
released to the wind.

614
01:02:46,345 --> 01:02:51,308
And the omens promised bad luck,
which moated and dungeoned him.

615
01:03:33,017 --> 01:03:35,560
How come it's you
that's gotta do all the chores?

616
01:03:35,728 --> 01:03:39,981
Charley and Bob pay extry to Martha
so that they don't have to.

617
01:03:41,275 --> 01:03:43,360
It still don't seem fair.

618
01:03:50,117 --> 01:03:51,660
Martha.

619
01:03:53,412 --> 01:03:55,997
Well, look what the cat dragged in.

620
01:04:00,795 --> 01:04:02,087
You come from Kentucky?

621
01:04:05,466 --> 01:04:09,302
Why do you have your head in a hole,
Martha?

622
01:04:12,348 --> 01:04:16,101
Wood and Dick had a shooting scrape
a few months ago.

623
01:04:17,645 --> 01:04:18,937
Cover the kettle, lda.

624
01:04:24,193 --> 01:04:26,486
And what did you and Dick
get in a scrape about?

625
01:04:30,366 --> 01:04:34,369
Well, he tampered
with my daddy's wife...

626
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:37,914
...while a pork chop
burned on the skillet...

627
01:04:38,082 --> 01:04:39,624
...so I shot at him.

628
01:04:44,672 --> 01:04:49,092
Ida! Do not stick your thumb
in the cream when you skim it.

629
01:04:50,261 --> 01:04:55,473
His chicanery and his philandering ways...

630
01:04:55,641 --> 01:04:57,601
...has instigated such malice.

631
01:04:57,768 --> 01:05:01,688
He's a yellow snake in the grass
and he can't be trusted, Martha.

632
01:05:04,609 --> 01:05:07,986
Dick told me a complete other version
of that affray.

633
01:05:09,447 --> 01:05:12,115
Wood Hite's downstairs.

634
01:05:12,825 --> 01:05:14,492
You mean he's here?

635
01:05:17,288 --> 01:05:19,998
Yeah, he come in late last night.

636
01:05:23,669 --> 01:05:24,711
Hey, simmer down!

637
01:05:24,879 --> 01:05:29,466
Don't get into a fracas up there, you boys!
I've got breakfast almost ready.

638
01:07:40,347 --> 01:07:42,557
He's still sucking air.

639
01:07:43,726 --> 01:07:45,935
But I think he's a goner.

640
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:59,365
Maybe y'all better come wish him well
on his journey.

641
01:08:26,185 --> 01:08:27,644
Wood?

642
01:08:30,064 --> 01:08:32,357
You were a good fellow, Wood.

643
01:08:32,566 --> 01:08:36,069
Oh, I sure hope you're not
in frightful pain, Wood.

644
01:08:36,654 --> 01:08:40,365
I'd get you something to drink,
but I'm afraid you'd just choke on it.

645
01:08:41,742 --> 01:08:43,910
Little lda's gonna miss you.

646
01:08:44,078 --> 01:08:46,204
So is the rest of the family.

647
01:08:49,416 --> 01:08:53,044
Well, one thing's settled.
Can't take him into Richmond.

648
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:55,213
Why not?

649
01:08:56,674 --> 01:08:59,217
Well, one, sheriff'll put Bob in jail.

650
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:03,263
And two, Jesse'll find out his cousin
Wood's been shot in our house...

651
01:09:03,430 --> 01:09:06,850
...and then that'll be the end
of each and every one of us.

652
01:09:16,735 --> 01:09:20,405
"And in one merciless, violent thrust
broke in...

653
01:09:20,865 --> 01:09:23,700
...and carried all before him,
and scented and brewed...

654
01:09:23,868 --> 01:09:26,411
...reeking with blood of my virginity...

655
01:09:26,579 --> 01:09:31,082
...up to its utmost length in my body."

656
01:09:32,710 --> 01:09:35,587
He ain't disappeared,
if that's what you were hoping.

657
01:09:40,050 --> 01:09:42,010
What chapter you on?

658
01:09:42,511 --> 01:09:47,557
She's met some Algerian corsair
down at Gibraltar.

659
01:09:47,725 --> 01:09:50,018
Got herself all agitated.

660
01:09:52,354 --> 01:09:53,771
How's that leg?

661
01:09:54,607 --> 01:09:58,776
Full of torment, Bob. Thanks for asking.

662
01:10:44,657 --> 01:10:47,325
Blessed are the poor in spirit...

663
01:10:47,493 --> 01:10:49,744
...for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

664
01:10:51,163 --> 01:10:56,751
Blessed are them that mourn,
for they shall be comforted.

665
01:10:58,879 --> 01:11:00,838
Blessed are the...

666
01:11:04,343 --> 01:11:05,885
Meek.

667
01:11:08,180 --> 01:11:10,014
Blessed are the meek.

668
01:11:45,968 --> 01:11:48,052
- Is it him?
- Yeah.

669
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:51,222
Why is he here? Does he know
about Wood, do you think?

670
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:53,808
I don't know. All I know is
he don't miss very much.

671
01:11:53,976 --> 01:11:57,937
- What should I say about you if he asks?
- Tell him I'm in K.C. with Mattie.

672
01:12:00,649 --> 01:12:04,444
He was buffalo hunting.
He was thrilled to meet yours truly.

673
01:12:04,611 --> 01:12:08,573
Yeah, over there in Europe there's only
two Americans they know for certain...

674
01:12:08,741 --> 01:12:11,659
...Mark Twain and Jesse James.

675
01:12:13,037 --> 01:12:16,247
- Why, it's the kid.
- How's everything?

676
01:12:18,709 --> 01:12:21,294
- I never take off my gun belts.
- Yeah?

677
01:12:21,462 --> 01:12:23,046
Good thinking.

678
01:12:29,136 --> 01:12:31,429
Well, Charley, did you hurt your leg?

679
01:12:33,932 --> 01:12:35,975
Yeah, I slipped--
I slipped off the roof...

680
01:12:36,143 --> 01:12:39,771
...and I smacked down into a snow bank
like a ton of stupidness.

681
01:12:39,938 --> 01:12:42,607
One second I'm screaming,
"Whoa, Nelly!"

682
01:12:42,775 --> 01:12:45,443
Next second, poof,
I'm neck-deep in snow.

683
01:12:48,322 --> 01:12:52,158
Well, whatever possessed you
to climb a roof in December?

684
01:12:58,165 --> 01:13:01,626
There was a k-- A kite. What am I saying?
There was a cat.

685
01:13:01,794 --> 01:13:04,212
A cat. it was on the roof
and I went after him.

686
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:08,925
It was a tomcat yowling
and what all, and I slipped.

687
01:13:20,854 --> 01:13:23,981
I thought maybe your club foot
was gaining on you.

688
01:13:32,991 --> 01:13:34,659
Oh, yeah.

689
01:13:35,411 --> 01:13:39,664
Dick went to Kansas City to be
with his wife. He was here for a bit.

690
01:13:59,268 --> 01:14:02,186
Hey, here's a cute story, Jess.

691
01:14:02,354 --> 01:14:05,690
Bobby was what, 11 or 12...

692
01:14:05,858 --> 01:14:09,026
...and you were by far
his most admired personage.

693
01:14:09,528 --> 01:14:10,695
He couldn't get enough.

694
01:14:10,863 --> 01:14:15,074
It was "Jesse this" and "Jesse that"
and "Jesse this" from sunrise to sunset.

695
01:14:15,242 --> 01:14:16,367
Fascinating.

696
01:14:16,535 --> 01:14:18,286
No, there's more. This is cute.

697
01:14:18,454 --> 01:14:23,207
We're at supper and Bob asks,
"You know what size boot Jesse wears?"

698
01:14:23,375 --> 01:14:27,128
- Charley, Jesse doesn't wanna hear this.
- Shush, now, Bob, let me tell it.

699
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:30,339
Bob says-- He says, "You know
what size boot Jesse wears?"

700
01:14:30,507 --> 01:14:33,676
He says, "Six and a half." He says,
"Ain't that a big enough boot...

701
01:14:33,844 --> 01:14:35,636
...for a man 5'8" tall?"

702
01:14:35,804 --> 01:14:39,640
I decided to josh him a little, you know,
he being my kid brother and everything.

703
01:14:39,808 --> 01:14:42,894
So I said, "He doesn't have toes is why."

704
01:14:43,061 --> 01:14:44,604
That's a really stupid story.

705
01:14:44,771 --> 01:14:49,400
"He was dangling his feet off a culvert
and a catfish nibbled his toes off."

706
01:14:49,568 --> 01:14:52,278
Bob taxed himself trying to picture it.

707
01:14:59,161 --> 01:15:01,829
That'd be a good joke if it was funny.

708
01:15:02,664 --> 01:15:05,208
Isn't that a cute story, Jess?

709
01:15:15,093 --> 01:15:17,929
Give me some more conversations, Bob.

710
01:15:23,018 --> 01:15:28,189
I got one. This one's about as crackerjack--
it's the one about your--

711
01:15:28,357 --> 01:15:30,274
Let Bob tell it.

712
01:15:31,610 --> 01:15:33,444
All right.

713
01:15:39,952 --> 01:15:41,953
I don't even know
what you're talking about.

714
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:46,123
About how you and Jesse
have so much in common.

715
01:15:49,169 --> 01:15:50,836
Go on, Bob.

716
01:15:51,004 --> 01:15:52,964
Yeah, come on, Bob.

717
01:15:53,715 --> 01:15:55,967
Tell us a story.

718
01:15:57,928 --> 01:16:02,515
- Nope. No.
- Come on, entertain Jesse. He's here.

719
01:16:09,481 --> 01:16:10,982
Come on.

720
01:16:17,864 --> 01:16:21,784
Well, if you'll pardon my saying so,
I guess...

721
01:16:21,952 --> 01:16:25,997
...it is interesting the many ways
you and I overlap and whatnot.

722
01:16:27,332 --> 01:16:30,084
I mean, you begin with our daddies.

723
01:16:30,252 --> 01:16:33,212
Your daddy was a pastor
at the New Hope Baptist Church...

724
01:16:33,380 --> 01:16:38,134
...and my daddy was a pastor
at the church in Excelsior Springs.

725
01:16:39,553 --> 01:16:43,889
You're the youngest of three James boys,
and I'm the youngest of five Ford boys.

726
01:16:45,684 --> 01:16:48,352
Between Charley and me,
there's another brother, Wilbur...

727
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:50,563
...with six letters in his name.

728
01:16:50,897 --> 01:16:56,527
And between Frank and you, is another
brother Robert, also with six letters.

729
01:16:56,695 --> 01:17:00,448
And my Christian name
is Robert, of course.

730
01:17:01,783 --> 01:17:03,951
You have blue eyes, I have blue eyes.

731
01:17:04,119 --> 01:17:08,122
You're 5'8" tall, I'm 5'8" tall.

732
01:17:12,878 --> 01:17:18,215
Me, I must have had a list as long as
your nightshirt when I was 12, but...

733
01:17:18,383 --> 01:17:21,844
...I seem to have lost some curiosities
over the years.

734
01:17:40,113 --> 01:17:42,323
Ain't he something?

735
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:59,090
Did I ever tell you the story about
that scalawag, George Shepherd?

736
01:17:59,424 --> 01:18:01,300
Shepherd's one of
Quantrill's lieutenants.

737
01:18:01,468 --> 01:18:04,178
He give me a story much like Bob's,
what bring him to mind.

738
01:18:04,638 --> 01:18:07,181
Going on about how much
we had in common, and so on...

739
01:18:07,349 --> 01:18:09,892
...so he could get in the gang.

740
01:18:10,060 --> 01:18:13,187
How could I have known
he had a grudge against me?

741
01:18:13,355 --> 01:18:17,858
How could I have known
he was lying to get on my good side?

742
01:18:18,026 --> 01:18:23,030
I said, "George, come on aboard.
Glad to have you."

743
01:18:23,198 --> 01:18:27,993
George thought he was smart,
except he wasn't.

744
01:18:28,954 --> 01:18:32,081
One morning, George rides into camp...

745
01:18:32,249 --> 01:18:34,458
...and about 20 guns open up on him.

746
01:18:38,255 --> 01:18:42,717
See, old George, he only had one eye. You
gotta have two eyes, you wanna get Jesse.

747
01:18:47,556 --> 01:18:50,683
You ought not think of me
like you do George Shepherd.

748
01:18:52,018 --> 01:18:54,270
You brought him to mind.

749
01:18:55,188 --> 01:18:57,481
Well, it's not very flattering.

750
01:19:03,488 --> 01:19:06,282
Sure is good eating, Martha.

751
01:19:07,159 --> 01:19:09,368
Well, I'm so glad you enjoyed it.

752
01:19:09,536 --> 01:19:11,704
How come George
had a grudge against you?

753
01:19:16,626 --> 01:19:20,713
I said, how come George
had a grudge against you?

754
01:19:26,428 --> 01:19:31,182
Well, you see, George had a nephew
he wanted me to protect during the war.

755
01:19:31,349 --> 01:19:33,559
This nephew had 5000 dollars on him.

756
01:19:33,727 --> 01:19:38,355
It just so happens he winds up killed
and someone swipes that money.

757
01:19:38,523 --> 01:19:42,359
And when George is in prison,
someone whispers to him:

758
01:19:42,527 --> 01:19:46,280
"it was Jesse James
slit the boy's throat."

759
01:19:51,036 --> 01:19:53,496
it was just mean gossip, was it?

760
01:19:55,290 --> 01:19:58,584
Bob's the expert. Let's put it to him.

761
01:20:03,673 --> 01:20:06,050
Oh, dear, I made him cranky.

762
01:20:06,218 --> 01:20:10,054
I'm not cranky. I just been
through this before, is all.

763
01:20:10,222 --> 01:20:13,390
Once people get around to making fun
of me, they don't ever let up.

764
01:20:13,558 --> 01:20:15,643
Someone's getting awful fresh over there.

765
01:20:15,811 --> 01:20:18,479
Woman, shut your face for once.

766
01:20:25,487 --> 01:20:27,822
Don't want you to skip off
to your room and pout...

767
01:20:27,989 --> 01:20:30,533
...without knowing why I come by
for this visit.

768
01:20:31,326 --> 01:20:33,410
Why? So you could
tell us how sorry you are...

769
01:20:33,578 --> 01:20:36,288
...you had to slap
our cousin Albert around?

770
01:20:49,928 --> 01:20:51,762
I come by...

771
01:20:51,930 --> 01:20:55,307
...to ask if one of you two Fords...

772
01:20:55,517 --> 01:20:58,894
...would care to ride with me
in a journey or two.

773
01:20:59,271 --> 01:21:02,648
I guess we both agree
it ought to be Charley.

774
01:21:02,816 --> 01:21:05,609
You been acting sort of testy.

775
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:38,809
Have you seen Wood Hite lately?

776
01:21:39,311 --> 01:21:42,855
No. Not at all.

777
01:21:50,822 --> 01:21:53,490
I swear that stew
had some squirrel meat in it.

778
01:21:53,658 --> 01:21:56,368
- Still arguing with you, is it?
- Yeah.

779
01:21:57,162 --> 01:21:59,079
- You're Charles Ford?
- Yes, ma'am.

780
01:21:59,247 --> 01:22:01,332
You've seen me once or twice before.

781
01:22:02,667 --> 01:22:04,585
I got a letter from George Hite.

782
01:22:05,211 --> 01:22:08,130
He hasn't seen hide nor hair of him.

783
01:22:09,633 --> 01:22:11,842
And you say you haven't seen Wood?

784
01:22:12,552 --> 01:22:15,721
No, I-- I can't imagine where he could be.

785
01:22:43,166 --> 01:22:44,208
Yeah?

786
01:22:45,377 --> 01:22:47,544
You finished with your sleeping?

787
01:22:49,047 --> 01:22:51,548
I could use a couple more hours
if it's no trouble.

788
01:23:03,228 --> 01:23:04,770
Yeah.

789
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:12,861
I been holding a discussion with myself
over if I ought to tell you this or no.

790
01:23:13,029 --> 01:23:15,698
My good side won out and...

791
01:23:16,908 --> 01:23:19,785
Well, I wanna make a clean breast
of things.

792
01:23:20,912 --> 01:23:25,082
Yeah, my mind's a little cobwebby
is the only drawback.

793
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:30,045
I could use a little--
A little more sleep.

794
01:23:32,590 --> 01:23:34,591
You know I went to Kentucky?

795
01:23:35,593 --> 01:23:37,011
Yeah.

796
01:23:37,721 --> 01:23:40,139
I come back through Saline County and...

797
01:23:41,558 --> 01:23:43,434
...I think to myself:

798
01:23:43,935 --> 01:23:48,731
"Why not stop by and see Ed Miller?"

799
01:23:50,900 --> 01:23:52,609
So I do.

800
01:23:56,448 --> 01:23:59,783
Well, things are not to my satisfaction.

801
01:24:01,953 --> 01:24:04,705
Ed's got himself all worked up
over something.

802
01:24:06,249 --> 01:24:09,501
I can see that he's lying like a rug.

803
01:24:12,839 --> 01:24:15,966
So I say to myself, "Enough's enough."

804
01:24:16,468 --> 01:24:19,261
And I say to Ed, "Come on, Ed.

805
01:24:20,180 --> 01:24:22,514
Let's go for a ride."

806
01:24:24,309 --> 01:24:27,227
You understand what I'm saying?

807
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:31,440
Going for a ride is like...

808
01:24:32,484 --> 01:24:35,652
Going for a ride
is like giving him what-for?

809
01:24:37,614 --> 01:24:39,323
Exactly.

810
01:24:43,828 --> 01:24:45,287
So...

811
01:24:47,999 --> 01:24:49,833
...Ed and Jesse...

812
01:24:52,253 --> 01:24:54,505
...they argue on the road.

813
01:24:58,968 --> 01:25:01,303
Did you ever count the stars?

814
01:25:04,766 --> 01:25:08,685
I can't ever get the same number.
They keep changing on me.

815
01:25:10,563 --> 01:25:13,607
I don't even know what a star is exactly.

816
01:25:16,319 --> 01:25:18,529
Well, your body knows.

817
01:25:19,405 --> 01:25:21,865
It's your mind that forgot.

818
01:25:31,668 --> 01:25:34,711
You go on ahead, partner.
I'll catch up with you.

819
01:26:14,919 --> 01:26:16,753
It's okay.

820
01:26:39,611 --> 01:26:43,071
It's okay, sweetheart. It's okay.

821
01:26:46,075 --> 01:26:48,535
And when push came to shove...

822
01:26:55,418 --> 01:26:57,794
...Jesse shot and killed him.

823
01:27:01,132 --> 01:27:03,008
Jesse did?

824
01:27:05,470 --> 01:27:07,221
You got it.

825
01:27:09,265 --> 01:27:10,641
You...

826
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:29,159
So, you see, your--

827
01:27:29,369 --> 01:27:31,828
Your cousin, he got off easy.

828
01:27:31,996 --> 01:27:33,622
I was just playing with Albert.

829
01:27:35,124 --> 01:27:38,794
Yeah, I made him squeal
once or twice myself.

830
01:27:39,087 --> 01:27:42,172
I'm just not as thorough as you are.

831
01:27:53,434 --> 01:27:56,478
You got a tale to swap with me now?

832
01:28:05,238 --> 01:28:07,656
I don't get your meaning.

833
01:28:09,701 --> 01:28:15,038
Seems to me, if you have something
to confess in exchange...

834
01:28:15,206 --> 01:28:17,374
...it'd only be right...

835
01:28:18,251 --> 01:28:21,586
...that you'd spit it out now.

836
01:28:33,391 --> 01:28:35,559
I can't think of a single thing.

837
01:28:38,438 --> 01:28:41,231
About Wood Hite, for example.

838
01:28:41,399 --> 01:28:46,236
I'm not gonna-- I been saying over and
over I can't figure out where he's gone.

839
01:28:46,404 --> 01:28:49,448
Now, I'm not gonna change my story
just to have something to spit.

840
01:28:49,615 --> 01:28:52,326
- Why was your brother so agitated?
- Which?

841
01:28:53,286 --> 01:28:54,411
Bob.

842
01:28:55,747 --> 01:28:58,749
That's just his way. He's antsy.

843
01:28:59,542 --> 01:29:00,959
You know?

844
01:29:17,143 --> 01:29:19,770
You go on back to sleep now.

845
01:29:21,397 --> 01:29:24,524
You got me agitated now, you see?

846
01:29:30,948 --> 01:29:35,118
Yeah, just ain't no peace
when old Jesse's around.

847
01:29:35,661 --> 01:29:38,663
You ought to pity my poor wife.

848
01:29:41,334 --> 01:29:43,502
Ed Miller was a good friend of mine.

849
01:29:43,669 --> 01:29:47,130
He introduced me to you
at that one poker game.

850
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:51,885
I'm a little angry with you, if you
wanna know the God's honest truth.

851
01:29:54,347 --> 01:29:56,848
You ought to pity me too.

852
01:30:42,395 --> 01:30:46,356
As proof of his confederacy with
the James Gang, Bob told the authorities...

853
01:30:46,524 --> 01:30:50,026
...that Dick Liddil was sleeping over
at the rented farmhouse...

854
01:30:50,194 --> 01:30:53,029
...while his ruined leg mended.

855
01:30:58,035 --> 01:31:01,872
And then, created a map
of the Harbison property...

856
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:08,253
...leaving out the creek where
Wood Hite's remains now moldered.

857
01:31:09,046 --> 01:31:11,214
Right, you boys are cornered!

858
01:31:11,382 --> 01:31:15,927
Come on out peaceably
and nobody'll get shot up!

859
01:31:21,058 --> 01:31:22,100
Don't shoot!

860
01:31:26,731 --> 01:31:28,732
Come on out and show yourself!

861
01:31:43,748 --> 01:31:45,290
Hello.

862
01:31:45,625 --> 01:31:47,250
We got him.

863
01:31:47,668 --> 01:31:49,711
Give me that Colt, son.

864
01:31:54,634 --> 01:31:57,219
- All right.
- Andrew James Liddil...

865
01:31:57,386 --> 01:32:00,388
...I have a warrant here
for your arrest...

866
01:32:00,556 --> 01:32:04,935
Snowstorms would move over Missouri
that Sunday, February 19th...

867
01:32:05,102 --> 01:32:08,104
...shutting down commerce
for more than two days.

868
01:32:09,732 --> 01:32:12,442
- Go, go, go.
- Are the papers here?

869
01:32:12,610 --> 01:32:16,279
- Wants to know if the papers are here.
- I don't care what he wants.

870
01:32:16,447 --> 01:32:18,281
Yet this wouldn't prevent Robert Ford...

871
01:32:18,449 --> 01:32:20,867
...from presenting himself
to Governor Crittenden...

872
01:32:21,035 --> 01:32:24,120
...at the Craig Rifles Ball on Wednesday.

873
01:32:24,288 --> 01:32:27,874
I deem it a great privilege
on this glorious occasion...

874
01:32:28,042 --> 01:32:30,043
...to recognize publicly...

875
01:32:30,211 --> 01:32:32,879
...the intelligent and effective assistance...

876
01:32:33,047 --> 01:32:37,842
...that Captain Henry Craig has rendered
the state of Missouri and myself...

877
01:32:38,010 --> 01:32:41,471
...in our joint quest
to rid Jackson County...

878
01:32:41,889 --> 01:32:43,848
...of the James band.

879
01:32:44,016 --> 01:32:46,643
The task that Captain Craig
has assumed...

880
01:32:46,811 --> 01:32:50,981
...will require fearless courage,
extraordinary vigilance...

881
01:32:51,148 --> 01:32:54,067
...and an unerring selection
of instrumentalities.

882
01:32:55,236 --> 01:32:59,906
Well, I've gotten the signal from my wife
that enough is enough.

883
01:33:00,074 --> 01:33:02,450
However, before I sit...

884
01:33:02,618 --> 01:33:05,745
...I would like to ask you
to join me in a toast...

885
01:33:06,163 --> 01:33:09,874
...to a great son
of the state of Missouri...

886
01:33:10,042 --> 01:33:13,878
-...my friend, Henry Craig.
- Here, here.

887
01:33:26,559 --> 01:33:28,184
Yes.

888
01:33:29,186 --> 01:33:31,021
Just let my attorney know.

889
01:33:35,484 --> 01:33:36,526
Hi, governor--

890
01:33:38,654 --> 01:33:41,906
Who is that? Who is it?

891
01:33:42,241 --> 01:33:43,825
Get out of the way, now.

892
01:33:53,794 --> 01:33:57,881
You know, you're more goddamn trouble
than you're worth, Bob.

893
01:33:58,049 --> 01:33:59,799
I was just gonna say hello.

894
01:33:59,967 --> 01:34:03,178
No, you weren't gonna do that, Bob.
That's not why you're down here.

895
01:34:03,346 --> 01:34:08,600
You think it's your goddamn coming-out.
You think you're the belle of the ball.

896
01:34:08,768 --> 01:34:13,021
Now you get upstairs and try to keep your
identity secret, you silly little bastard.

897
01:34:13,189 --> 01:34:16,066
The governor'll see you in good time.
Take him up, boys.

898
01:34:21,572 --> 01:34:23,698
Bob would later be cross-examined
repeatedly...

899
01:34:23,866 --> 01:34:28,078
...about the exact nature of the deal
he had made with the authorities.

900
01:34:28,245 --> 01:34:31,164
And he was never consistent
in his recollections.

901
01:34:35,336 --> 01:34:39,589
My wife's asleep in the other room,
so let's speak as quietly as we can.

902
01:34:40,257 --> 01:34:42,467
So you're Dick Little.

903
01:34:44,345 --> 01:34:45,887
Liddil.

904
01:34:46,597 --> 01:34:48,556
I beg your pardon?

905
01:34:48,849 --> 01:34:50,433
I spell it with two D's.

906
01:34:50,601 --> 01:34:52,977
He's given us a full confession, governor.

907
01:34:53,145 --> 01:34:55,271
Newspapers haven't caught onto it yet.

908
01:34:55,439 --> 01:34:58,942
And you've guaranteed him
a conditional pardon...

909
01:34:59,110 --> 01:35:02,987
...and amnesty for all the robberies
he's committed.

910
01:35:04,615 --> 01:35:05,865
You Robert Ford?

911
01:35:09,370 --> 01:35:10,662
How old are you?

912
01:35:12,748 --> 01:35:14,165
Twenty.

913
01:35:14,458 --> 01:35:17,001
You surrender to Sheriff Timberlake
as well?

914
01:35:17,169 --> 01:35:21,089
No, no, governor. That's his brother,
Charley Ford, he's in the James Gang.

915
01:35:21,257 --> 01:35:23,967
But little Bob here,
we got nothing on Bob.

916
01:35:24,135 --> 01:35:26,720
He's just acting in the capacity of...

917
01:35:28,931 --> 01:35:31,099
...a private detective.

918
01:35:32,268 --> 01:35:34,310
Jesse James sent me a telegram
last month...

919
01:35:34,478 --> 01:35:37,647
...saying he'd kill me
if he had to wreck a train to do it.

920
01:35:37,815 --> 01:35:40,442
He said once I got in his hands,
he'd cut my heart out...

921
01:35:40,609 --> 01:35:43,111
...and eat it in strips like it was bacon.

922
01:35:43,279 --> 01:35:45,196
I'll wreck his train first.

923
01:35:52,788 --> 01:35:56,958
I'm sorry, Your Excellency.
I was thinking about something else.

924
01:35:57,126 --> 01:35:59,461
Jesse James is nothing more
than a public outlaw...

925
01:35:59,628 --> 01:36:02,422
...who made his reputation
by stealing whatever he wanted...

926
01:36:02,590 --> 01:36:04,841
...killing whoever got in his way.

927
01:36:05,009 --> 01:36:08,595
You'll hear some fools say he's getting back
at Republicans and Union men...

928
01:36:08,763 --> 01:36:11,514
...for the wrongs his family suffered
during the war.

929
01:36:11,682 --> 01:36:16,436
But his victims have scarcely been selected
with reference to their political views.

930
01:36:16,937 --> 01:36:19,647
I'm saying his sins will soon find him out.

931
01:36:19,815 --> 01:36:22,484
I'm saying his cup of iniquity is full.

932
01:36:22,651 --> 01:36:25,361
I'm saying Jesse James
is a desperate case...

933
01:36:25,654 --> 01:36:28,531
...and may require a desperate remedy.

934
01:36:31,869 --> 01:36:34,996
Y'all got the right man for the job.

935
01:36:51,347 --> 01:36:53,598
Come on. Come on, now.

936
01:36:54,183 --> 01:36:55,809
Come on, now.

937
01:37:40,187 --> 01:37:42,772
Have you ever considered suicide?

938
01:37:44,775 --> 01:37:50,113
I can't say that I have. There's always
something else I wanted to do.

939
01:37:51,198 --> 01:37:57,078
Or my predicaments changed,
or I saw my hardships from a different slant.

940
01:37:57,246 --> 01:38:01,624
You know all what can happen.
It never seemed respectable.

941
01:38:08,424 --> 01:38:11,259
I'll tell you one thing that's for certain.

942
01:38:11,427 --> 01:38:15,388
You won't mind dying
once you've peeked over the other side.

943
01:38:19,143 --> 01:38:22,186
You'll no more wanna go back
to your body than...

944
01:38:22,354 --> 01:38:24,814
...you'd wanna spoon up your own puke.

945
01:38:31,322 --> 01:38:34,157
Hey, since we're looking to rob banks...

946
01:38:34,325 --> 01:38:38,953
...I was wondering if we could
add another fella to the gang...

947
01:38:39,121 --> 01:38:42,707
...and sort of see if we couldn't
come out of our next job alive.

948
01:38:45,169 --> 01:38:50,173
Bob wanted to know could he ride with us
next time we took on a savings bank or--

949
01:38:56,513 --> 01:38:58,973
A savings bank or a--

950
01:39:00,684 --> 01:39:02,435
A rail road.

951
01:39:09,818 --> 01:39:13,112
Bob isn't much more than a boy
to most appearances.

952
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:16,032
But there's about two tons
of sand in him.

953
01:39:16,200 --> 01:39:19,452
And he'll stand with a shooter
when that's what's called for.

954
01:39:19,620 --> 01:39:23,873
And he's smart too.
He's about as intricate as they come.

955
01:39:26,001 --> 01:39:28,711
You forget I already met the kid.

956
01:39:30,047 --> 01:39:32,757
Hell, he surely thinks highly of you.

957
01:39:33,300 --> 01:39:36,052
All of America thinks highly of me.

958
01:39:36,762 --> 01:39:40,014
Still, not like you got two million names
to snatch out of a sock...

959
01:39:40,182 --> 01:39:42,350
...whenever you need a third man.

960
01:39:45,854 --> 01:39:48,898
I can see you trying to
wear me down on this.

961
01:39:49,066 --> 01:39:51,234
That's my main intention.

962
01:40:00,327 --> 01:40:02,996
Robberies would be conceived
but never carried out...

963
01:40:03,163 --> 01:40:06,749
...in Nebraska, Colorado and Missouri.

964
01:40:07,376 --> 01:40:08,459
During this time...

965
01:40:08,627 --> 01:40:12,672
...Henry Craig enjoined Robert Ford to return
to Elias' Grocery Store in Richmond...

966
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:15,925
...and await instructions
from Sheriff James Timberlake.

967
01:40:16,343 --> 01:40:18,594
All right, three cans...

968
01:40:18,762 --> 01:40:22,515
...peaches. Two cans...

969
01:40:23,767 --> 01:40:26,310
Two cans sifted peas.

970
01:40:26,603 --> 01:40:28,271
One bottle...

971
01:40:31,066 --> 01:40:34,277
...Mary's Morning Tonic, and a half--

972
01:40:37,322 --> 01:40:39,907
Half a sack of flour.

973
01:40:41,076 --> 01:40:43,119
I'll be right with you.

974
01:40:59,136 --> 01:41:01,471
I haven't seen any sign of him.

975
01:41:02,931 --> 01:41:05,308
Well, do you know where he's living?

976
01:41:06,393 --> 01:41:07,769
No.

977
01:41:08,937 --> 01:41:10,354
No?

978
01:41:13,108 --> 01:41:15,860
Well, I can't guess how he does it...

979
01:41:16,028 --> 01:41:20,323
...but he is always knowledgeable
about what's going on.

980
01:41:20,491 --> 01:41:24,827
He's gonna know I've been here with you.
You ought to take that for granted.

981
01:41:27,331 --> 01:41:31,292
And he will kill you if he gets the chance.

982
01:41:34,505 --> 01:41:37,090
Are you willing to risk that?

983
01:41:41,678 --> 01:41:43,429
Yes, I am.

984
01:41:46,517 --> 01:41:48,226
I've been a nobody all my life.

985
01:41:49,186 --> 01:41:51,020
I was the baby.

986
01:41:51,271 --> 01:41:54,690
I was the one they made promises to
that they never kept.

987
01:41:55,901 --> 01:42:00,613
And ever since I can remember it,
Jesse James has been as big as a tree.

988
01:42:04,034 --> 01:42:06,327
I'm prepared for this, Jim...

989
01:42:07,204 --> 01:42:09,372
...and I'm gonna accomplish it.

990
01:42:09,623 --> 01:42:11,707
I know I won't get
but this one opportunity...

991
01:42:11,875 --> 01:42:14,794
...and you can bet your life
I'm not gonna spoil it.

992
01:42:26,807 --> 01:42:27,890
Well...

993
01:42:29,059 --> 01:42:31,060
...wait for your chance.

994
01:42:31,562 --> 01:42:34,981
Don't let yourself be found alone with him,
and do not...

995
01:42:35,858 --> 01:42:38,234
...let him get behind you.

996
01:43:06,388 --> 01:43:07,597
You been chosen.

997
01:43:12,561 --> 01:43:14,145
Well, what do you mean?

998
01:43:15,439 --> 01:43:17,940
Well, your brother said that
you might wanna join us.

999
01:43:18,108 --> 01:43:21,444
But maybe you like this grocery store
more than you said you did.

1000
01:43:24,740 --> 01:43:26,782
- So you missed me?
- Oh, yeah.

1001
01:43:27,451 --> 01:43:30,119
I been crying myself to sleep every night.

1002
01:43:39,671 --> 01:43:41,672
Don't let him see us so much as wink.

1003
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:45,676
He's suspicious as a damn coyote,
and he don't trust you one iota.

1004
01:43:46,386 --> 01:43:48,179
- Well, I guess that makes--
- Hey.

1005
01:43:48,347 --> 01:43:52,808
He already put away Ed Miller. He said so
like it was something piddly he'd done.

1006
01:44:33,809 --> 01:44:38,020
If we're ever alone for more than a minute,
I'd like a chance to talk to you further.

1007
01:45:17,769 --> 01:45:20,021
They gave me ten days.

1008
01:45:23,900 --> 01:45:25,401
For what?

1009
01:45:27,404 --> 01:45:29,238
For arresting him.

1010
01:45:35,329 --> 01:45:36,996
You and me, huh?

1011
01:45:40,625 --> 01:45:43,919
It's gonna happen one way or another,
Charley. It's gonna happen.

1012
01:45:44,087 --> 01:45:46,672
So it might as well be us
who get rich on it.

1013
01:45:46,840 --> 01:45:50,134
- Bob, he's our friend.
- He murdered Ed Miller.

1014
01:45:50,761 --> 01:45:53,888
And he's gonna murder Liddil and Cummins
if the chance ever comes.

1015
01:45:55,307 --> 01:45:59,935
It seems to me Jesse's riding from
man to man, saying goodbye to the gang.

1016
01:46:01,438 --> 01:46:03,814
So your friendship could put you
under the pansies.

1017
01:46:05,901 --> 01:46:10,363
I'll grind it fine in my mind, Bob. I can't
go any further than that right now.

1018
01:46:13,950 --> 01:46:15,368
You'll come around.

1019
01:46:16,495 --> 01:46:18,954
You think it's all made up, don't you?

1020
01:46:19,122 --> 01:46:22,458
You think it's all yarns
and newspaper stories.

1021
01:46:30,342 --> 01:46:32,676
He's just a human being.

1022
01:46:40,936 --> 01:46:44,063
From now on, you two
won't go anywhere without me.

1023
01:46:44,815 --> 01:46:49,402
From now on, you'll ask for my permission!
From now on, you'll ask to be excused!

1024
01:47:45,333 --> 01:47:49,628
Charley, take them horses
around the barn. Bob, you go on inside.

1025
01:47:50,464 --> 01:47:51,797
- Hello, Mary.
- Hi.

1026
01:47:51,965 --> 01:47:55,134
Look at this rotten parsnip
I found in the compost heap.

1027
01:48:05,353 --> 01:48:07,229
You never mentioned Bob would be here.

1028
01:48:11,526 --> 01:48:14,528
Maybe he was saving it
as a pleasant surprise.

1029
01:48:19,117 --> 01:48:21,785
Got two cousins for company now.

1030
01:48:31,505 --> 01:48:33,797
How it's gonna be is...

1031
01:48:34,174 --> 01:48:38,385
...we'll leave next Monday afternoon
and ride down to Platte City.

1032
01:48:41,264 --> 01:48:43,182
How far is that from Kansas City?

1033
01:48:44,893 --> 01:48:47,728
Platte City's 30 miles south.

1034
01:48:49,356 --> 01:48:53,943
You and me and Charley'll
sleep in the woods overnight...

1035
01:48:54,444 --> 01:48:58,864
...and we'll strike the Wells Bank
sometime before the court recesses.

1036
01:49:03,662 --> 01:49:06,622
What time will that be exactly?

1037
01:49:12,254 --> 01:49:14,797
Well, you don't need to know that.

1038
01:49:29,813 --> 01:49:32,773
You know, I'm real comfortable
with your brother.

1039
01:49:32,983 --> 01:49:35,526
Hell, he's ugly as sin,
he smells like a skunk...

1040
01:49:36,319 --> 01:49:39,780
...and he's so ignorant
he couldn't drive nails in the snow...

1041
01:49:39,948 --> 01:49:42,449
...but he's sort of easy to be around.

1042
01:49:42,951 --> 01:49:45,744
I can't say the same for you, Bob.

1043
01:49:49,165 --> 01:49:51,500
Well, I'm sorry to hear you say that.

1044
01:49:53,378 --> 01:49:57,423
You know how it is when you're
with your girlfriend and the moon's out...

1045
01:49:57,591 --> 01:50:01,677
...and you know she wants to be kissed,
even though she never said so?

1046
01:50:05,056 --> 01:50:06,515
Yeah.

1047
01:50:09,227 --> 01:50:12,605
Well, you're giving me signs
that grieve my soul...

1048
01:50:13,481 --> 01:50:15,608
...and make me wonder...

1049
01:50:16,026 --> 01:50:18,360
...maybe your mind's
been changed about me.

1050
01:50:18,695 --> 01:50:22,197
Well, what do you want me to do?
Swear my good faith on the Bible?

1051
01:50:39,674 --> 01:50:41,592
You two having a spat?

1052
01:50:46,890 --> 01:50:49,391
I was getting ready to be angry.

1053
01:50:54,856 --> 01:50:57,191
Sit over here closer, kid.

1054
01:50:59,402 --> 01:51:00,694
Come on.

1055
01:51:11,831 --> 01:51:14,166
Charley, you'll stay with the animals.

1056
01:51:14,834 --> 01:51:16,752
Me and the kid...

1057
01:51:16,920 --> 01:51:20,881
...will walk into that bank
just before noon.

1058
01:51:22,759 --> 01:51:25,386
Bob will move that cashier...

1059
01:51:25,929 --> 01:51:29,139
...away from the shotgun
that's under the counter...

1060
01:51:29,307 --> 01:51:32,184
...and I'll creep up behind that cashier...

1061
01:51:32,352 --> 01:51:34,687
...and I'll cock his head back like so.

1062
01:51:34,938 --> 01:51:35,979
And I'll say:

1063
01:51:36,147 --> 01:51:39,400
"How come an off-scouring
of creation like you is still sucking air...

1064
01:51:39,567 --> 01:51:41,402
...when so many of mine are in coffins?

1065
01:51:41,569 --> 01:51:44,863
How did you get to reach 20
without leaking out all over your clothes?"

1066
01:51:45,281 --> 01:51:49,159
And if I don't like his attitude,
I will slit that phildoodle so deep...

1067
01:51:49,452 --> 01:51:52,496
...he will flop on the floor like a fish.

1068
01:51:56,167 --> 01:51:58,544
My God, what just happened?

1069
01:52:07,804 --> 01:52:11,140
Boy, I could hear your gears grinding...

1070
01:52:11,474 --> 01:52:14,810
...hear your little motor wondering,
"My gosh, what's next?

1071
01:52:14,978 --> 01:52:16,353
What's happening to me?"

1072
01:52:18,231 --> 01:52:20,107
You were precious to behold, Bob.

1073
01:52:20,275 --> 01:52:22,901
You were white as spit in a cotton field.

1074
01:52:23,445 --> 01:52:25,904
You got him. You got him.

1075
01:52:27,574 --> 01:52:31,618
You wanna know how that feels?
Unpleasant. I honestly can't recommend it.

1076
01:52:37,125 --> 01:52:39,585
The old Charley looked stricken!

1077
01:52:40,253 --> 01:52:42,087
I was. I was.

1078
01:52:42,255 --> 01:52:47,259
"This is plumb unexpected," old Charley
was thinking. "That done ruined my day."

1079
01:52:55,018 --> 01:52:56,477
Hell. Hell.

1080
01:53:27,425 --> 01:53:31,303
Jesse slept with Bob
in the children's room that night.

1081
01:53:32,597 --> 01:53:35,224
And Bob remained awake.

1082
01:53:38,061 --> 01:53:41,396
He could see that there was a gun
on the nightstand.

1083
01:53:42,273 --> 01:53:46,276
He could imagine its cold nickel
inside his grip...

1084
01:53:47,195 --> 01:53:50,697
...its two-pound weight
reached out and aimed.

1085
01:54:21,813 --> 01:54:23,939
I need to go to the privy.

1086
01:54:25,108 --> 01:54:28,527
You think you do, but you don't.

1087
01:54:51,759 --> 01:54:53,927
You wait for grace, now.

1088
01:54:54,846 --> 01:54:58,181
- Thank you, Mama.
- Thank you, Zee. God, that looks good.

1089
01:54:58,349 --> 01:54:59,975
- Thank you, Zee.
- You're welcome.

1090
01:55:00,143 --> 01:55:03,270
Well, is this fit to eat or will it just do?

1091
01:55:06,149 --> 01:55:08,275
Woman's cooking's
always been a scandal.

1092
01:55:08,443 --> 01:55:10,819
Cut her meat and the whole table moves.

1093
01:55:11,738 --> 01:55:13,822
You want a biscuit?
You gonna have a biscuit?

1094
01:55:13,990 --> 01:55:17,784
Here's some butter.
Come on. Come on.

1095
01:55:19,704 --> 01:55:20,996
Oh, shoot.

1096
01:55:21,164 --> 01:55:25,000
And so it went,
Jesse was increasingly cavalier...

1097
01:55:25,168 --> 01:55:28,879
...merry, moody, fey...

1098
01:55:29,047 --> 01:55:31,173
...unpredictable.

1099
01:55:32,675 --> 01:55:35,844
He camouflaged his depressions
and derangements...

1100
01:55:36,012 --> 01:55:40,015
...with masquerades
of extreme cordiality, courtesy...

1101
01:55:40,183 --> 01:55:42,935
...and goodwill towards others.

1102
01:55:44,020 --> 01:55:48,273
But even as he jested,
or tickled his boy in the ribs...

1103
01:55:48,441 --> 01:55:52,069
...Jesse would look over at Bob
with melancholy eyes...

1104
01:55:52,236 --> 01:55:56,198
...as if the two were meshed
in an intimate communication.

1105
01:55:59,035 --> 01:56:01,662
Bob was certain that the man
had unriddled him...

1106
01:56:01,829 --> 01:56:04,498
...had seen through his reasons
for coming along...

1107
01:56:04,666 --> 01:56:08,669
...that Jesse could forecast each of
Bob's possible moves and inclinations...

1108
01:56:08,836 --> 01:56:10,671
...and was only acting the innocent...

1109
01:56:10,838 --> 01:56:15,759
...in order to lull Bob
into stupid tranquility and miscalculation.

1110
01:56:37,448 --> 01:56:39,658
How long you been studying me?

1111
01:56:41,577 --> 01:56:44,287
You're gonna break a lot of hearts.

1112
01:56:52,213 --> 01:56:53,422
How do you mean?

1113
01:57:02,640 --> 01:57:04,391
It's a present.

1114
01:57:09,063 --> 01:57:10,605
It's heavy.

1115
01:57:11,190 --> 01:57:13,316
Well, you gonna look inside?

1116
01:57:14,902 --> 01:57:16,695
It's April Fools' Day, you know.

1117
01:57:17,280 --> 01:57:19,114
It ain't no joke.

1118
01:57:26,622 --> 01:57:28,165
Oh, such extravagance.

1119
01:57:29,709 --> 01:57:32,419
Don't that nickel just shine, though?

1120
01:57:32,628 --> 01:57:34,171
It's more than I could hope for.

1121
01:57:34,338 --> 01:57:37,132
I figured that granddaddy Colt
may blow into fragments...

1122
01:57:37,300 --> 01:57:40,093
...next time you try
to squeeze the trigger.

1123
01:57:40,303 --> 01:57:42,721
Well, you might have something there.

1124
01:57:43,222 --> 01:57:45,849
Tom, supper's ready.

1125
01:57:47,018 --> 01:57:49,061
I'll be right there, sweetheart.

1126
01:57:49,228 --> 01:57:51,521
I might be too excited to eat.

1127
01:57:54,817 --> 01:57:57,319
You know what John Newman Edwards
once wrote about me?

1128
01:57:58,321 --> 01:58:01,156
He said I didn't trust
two men in 10,000...

1129
01:58:01,324 --> 01:58:03,992
...and even them I was cautious around.

1130
01:58:04,827 --> 01:58:06,828
Government's sort of run me ragged.

1131
01:58:08,790 --> 01:58:11,792
I'm going the long way around the barn
to say that...

1132
01:58:11,959 --> 01:58:15,587
...I been feeling cornered
and just plain ornery as of late...

1133
01:58:16,339 --> 01:58:21,009
...and I'd be pleased if you'd accept
that gun as my way of apologizing.

1134
01:58:23,346 --> 01:58:26,181
Heaven knows I'd be ornerier
if I were in your position.

1135
01:58:26,349 --> 01:58:29,434
No. No, I haven't been acting correctly.

1136
01:58:31,229 --> 01:58:34,773
Seems I hardly recognize myself
when I'm greased.

1137
01:58:37,860 --> 01:58:40,362
I go on journeys out of my body...

1138
01:58:40,530 --> 01:58:44,616
...and look at my red hands
and my mean face...

1139
01:58:45,368 --> 01:58:49,121
...and I wonder about that man
that's gone so wrong.

1140
01:58:52,875 --> 01:58:55,919
I've been becoming a problem to myself.

1141
01:59:08,558 --> 01:59:09,933
Well...

1142
01:59:16,566 --> 01:59:21,236
- I better wash my hands if supper's on.
- Yeah, go ahead.

1143
01:59:34,584 --> 01:59:37,502
The day before he died was Palm Sunday.

1144
01:59:38,546 --> 01:59:41,840
And Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Howard,
their two children...

1145
01:59:42,008 --> 01:59:44,092
...and their cousin Charles Johnson...

1146
01:59:44,260 --> 01:59:49,431
...strolled to the Second Presbyterian
Church to attend the 10:00 service.

1147
01:59:51,809 --> 01:59:54,102
Bob remained at the cottage...

1148
01:59:54,270 --> 01:59:57,689
...and slyly migrated from room to room.

1149
02:00:00,276 --> 02:00:02,110
He walked into the master bedroom...

1150
02:00:02,278 --> 02:00:06,072
...and inventoried the clothes
on the hangers and hooks.

1151
02:00:12,371 --> 02:00:15,707
He sipped from the water glass
on the vanity.

1152
02:00:18,044 --> 02:00:22,297
He smelled the talcum and lilacs
on Jesse's pillowcase.

1153
02:00:30,223 --> 02:00:32,432
His fingers skittered over his ribs...

1154
02:00:32,600 --> 02:00:36,478
...to construe the scars
where Jesse was twice shot.

1155
02:00:40,274 --> 02:00:44,861
He manufactured a middle finger
that was missing the top two knuckles.

1156
02:00:52,328 --> 02:00:55,247
He imagined himself at 34.

1157
02:00:57,250 --> 02:01:00,252
He imagined himself in a coffin.

1158
02:01:02,338 --> 02:01:04,047
He considered possibilities...

1159
02:01:04,215 --> 02:01:07,509
...and everything wonderful
that could come true.

1160
02:01:35,329 --> 02:01:37,247
He's not gonna kill us.

1161
02:01:42,503 --> 02:01:44,671
Yeah, he is.

1162
02:01:46,966 --> 02:01:49,467
Well, I'll stay awake so he can't.

1163
02:02:02,815 --> 02:02:05,233
You're imagining things.

1164
02:02:17,496 --> 02:02:19,456
Ain't gonna be no Platte City.

1165
02:02:21,208 --> 02:02:23,835
That's Jesse fooling with us.

1166
02:02:40,269 --> 02:02:42,479
Go to sleep, Charley.

1167
02:03:16,097 --> 02:03:17,680
Morning.

1168
02:03:21,477 --> 02:03:23,019
Charley.

1169
02:03:52,842 --> 02:03:55,301
Bob, how much did you want to eat?

1170
02:03:59,807 --> 02:04:02,225
I'm feeling sort of peculiar.

1171
02:04:21,454 --> 02:04:23,913
Why is it you're looking so interested?

1172
02:04:25,374 --> 02:04:28,293
You think it's intelligent
to go out like that...

1173
02:04:28,461 --> 02:04:30,295
...so all creation can see your guns?

1174
02:04:48,063 --> 02:04:49,481
Hi.

1175
02:04:59,783 --> 02:05:02,702
Come on, let's go see
what your mama's doing.

1176
02:05:03,829 --> 02:05:05,955
Timmy, get that door, would you?

1177
02:05:10,085 --> 02:05:13,254
- Well, you lost your shoe, sweetheart.
- Yeah, I did.

1178
02:05:13,422 --> 02:05:17,592
That's gonna be a problem.
They don't sell those one at a time.

1179
02:05:19,094 --> 02:05:21,137
We lost a shoe, Mama.

1180
02:05:22,765 --> 02:05:25,308
Will you put that up for Daddy,
would you?

1181
02:05:28,395 --> 02:05:31,147
- What you doing, you lose a shoe?
- Yeah.

1182
02:05:47,873 --> 02:05:51,292
It's only meant to go on top,
to complement.

1183
02:05:51,544 --> 02:05:53,378
Yeah, I know. Sometimes, I--

1184
02:06:17,987 --> 02:06:20,863
Bob, everything's getting cold!

1185
02:06:21,574 --> 02:06:24,993
- Where's Mary?
- She's outside, darling.

1186
02:06:25,995 --> 02:06:27,787
Mary?

1187
02:06:31,542 --> 02:06:34,085
What do you think goes on
in that noggin of his?

1188
02:06:37,089 --> 02:06:38,798
Nothing.

1189
02:06:39,341 --> 02:06:42,176
I was talking about his mind, not yours.

1190
02:06:43,095 --> 02:06:44,846
Oh, yeah.

1191
02:06:45,264 --> 02:06:46,973
Oh, I get it.

1192
02:07:42,404 --> 02:07:44,364
Well, hello now.

1193
02:07:44,740 --> 02:07:47,784
"The arrest and confession
of Dick Liddil."

1194
02:07:53,040 --> 02:07:55,208
You don't say so.

1195
02:08:09,515 --> 02:08:11,599
That's very strange.

1196
02:08:12,059 --> 02:08:14,936
Says here Dick surrendered
three weeks ago.

1197
02:08:15,104 --> 02:08:17,730
You must have been
right in the neighborhood.

1198
02:08:18,399 --> 02:08:21,025
Well, apparently, they kept it a secret.

1199
02:08:32,246 --> 02:08:35,289
If I get to Kansas City soon,
I'll ask somebody about it.

1200
02:09:15,998 --> 02:09:17,665
You two ready?

1201
02:09:21,378 --> 02:09:24,046
I will be, by noon.

1202
02:09:56,955 --> 02:09:59,624
There is a ship
She sails the sea

1203
02:09:59,792 --> 02:10:02,543
She's loaded deep
As deep can be

1204
02:10:02,711 --> 02:10:04,962
But not as deep
As the love I'm in

1205
02:10:05,547 --> 02:10:09,175
I know not if I sink or swim

1206
02:10:10,219 --> 02:10:11,886
The water is wide

1207
02:10:13,055 --> 02:10:19,602
I can't cross o'er
And neither have I wings to fly

1208
02:10:20,062 --> 02:10:23,856
Give me a boat
That can carry two

1209
02:10:24,024 --> 02:10:26,901
Both shall row
My love and I

1210
02:10:27,069 --> 02:10:30,530
For love is gentle
And love is kind

1211
02:10:30,697 --> 02:10:33,699
Sweetest flower
When first it's new

1212
02:10:33,867 --> 02:10:37,453
But love grows old
And waxes cold

1213
02:10:37,621 --> 02:10:40,873
And fades away
Like the morning dew

1214
02:10:41,041 --> 02:10:44,085
There is a ship
She sails the sea

1215
02:10:44,253 --> 02:10:47,004
I guess I'll take my guns off...

1216
02:10:47,339 --> 02:10:49,340
...for fear the neighbors might spy them.

1217
02:11:22,624 --> 02:11:25,084
Don't that picture look dusty?

1218
02:13:07,187 --> 02:13:10,189
What have--? What have you done?

1219
02:13:12,609 --> 02:13:14,235
Jesse.

1220
02:13:19,783 --> 02:13:20,825
Jesse?

1221
02:13:21,952 --> 02:13:24,078
Jesse? Jesse?

1222
02:13:24,830 --> 02:13:26,706
Jesse!

1223
02:13:27,708 --> 02:13:29,792
No!

1224
02:13:33,964 --> 02:13:36,298
No. Jess--

1225
02:13:36,925 --> 02:13:41,303
Come back. Oh, come back.

1226
02:13:43,432 --> 02:13:47,601
Oh, Jesse! No!

1227
02:13:48,103 --> 02:13:52,023
Oh, Bob. Have you done this?!

1228
02:13:52,232 --> 02:13:54,608
I swear to God I didn't.

1229
02:13:55,610 --> 02:13:57,028
It was an accident, Zee.

1230
02:13:59,239 --> 02:14:02,616
Come on. Pistol went off accidentally.

1231
02:14:47,954 --> 02:14:49,163
Put my name.

1232
02:14:49,331 --> 02:14:51,791
Why, what'd you do? I shot him.

1233
02:14:59,007 --> 02:15:01,008
You might wanna keep that.

1234
02:15:38,964 --> 02:15:41,048
Thank you all very much.

1235
02:15:49,224 --> 02:15:51,725
The resulting prints
sold for 2 dollars apiece...

1236
02:15:51,893 --> 02:15:56,480
...and were the models for the lithographed
covers on a number of magazines.

1237
02:16:02,028 --> 02:16:07,241
Soon a thousand strangers were making
spellbound pilgrimages to the cottage...

1238
02:16:07,576 --> 02:16:12,121
...or were venerating the iced remains
in Seidenfaden's cooling room.

1239
02:16:13,039 --> 02:16:17,543
The man who offered 30,000 dollars for
the body of President Garfield's assassin...

1240
02:16:17,711 --> 02:16:21,589
...sent a telegram to City Marshal
Enos Craig offering 50,000...

1241
02:16:21,756 --> 02:16:24,091
...for the body
of Jesse Woodson James...

1242
02:16:24,259 --> 02:16:27,011
...so that he could go around the country
with it...

1243
02:16:29,431 --> 02:16:34,393
...or at least sell it to P.T. Barnum
for his Greatest Show on Earth.

1244
02:16:38,440 --> 02:16:41,567
Another photograph was taken
of the renowned American bandit...

1245
02:16:41,735 --> 02:16:44,320
...nestled in his bed of ice.

1246
02:16:44,487 --> 02:16:48,782
And it was this shot that was most
available in sundries and apothecaries...

1247
02:16:48,950 --> 02:16:52,620
...to be viewed in a stereoscope
alongside the sphinx...

1248
02:16:52,787 --> 02:16:56,790
...the Taj Mahal,
and the catacombs of Rome.

1249
02:17:21,983 --> 02:17:23,943
Hello, here!

1250
02:17:24,152 --> 02:17:26,737
"The arrest and confession
of Dick Liddil."

1251
02:17:26,905 --> 02:17:32,034
Young man, I thought you told me
you didn't know Dick had surrendered.

1252
02:17:32,202 --> 02:17:36,080
You mean he did? I didn't know.

1253
02:17:36,998 --> 02:17:38,874
But I knew I had not fooled him.

1254
02:17:39,042 --> 02:17:42,878
And he knew, as well as I, in that moment
that I intended to bring him to justice.

1255
02:17:43,838 --> 02:17:47,383
But he would not kill me
in the presence of his wife and children.

1256
02:17:47,550 --> 02:17:50,803
And so he was smiling
to throw me off-guard.

1257
02:17:54,015 --> 02:17:56,684
Well, it's all right, anyway, Bob.

1258
02:17:58,561 --> 02:18:01,480
It was widely felt that
Bob possessed some acting talent...

1259
02:18:01,648 --> 02:18:03,899
...and Charley, not a jot.

1260
02:18:04,067 --> 02:18:07,027
That picture's awful dusty.

1261
02:18:07,821 --> 02:18:10,948
Charley was only expected
not to slouch or mutter...

1262
02:18:11,116 --> 02:18:15,786
...and to transport his sicknesses
to the alley before letting them go.

1263
02:18:45,191 --> 02:18:47,067
And that's...

1264
02:18:47,610 --> 02:18:50,279
...how I killed Jesse James.

1265
02:18:53,742 --> 02:18:57,286
By October of 1883, Bob Ford
could be identified correctly...

1266
02:18:57,454 --> 02:19:01,749
...by more citizens than could
the president of the United States.

1267
02:19:02,417 --> 02:19:07,129
He was as renowned at 20 as Jesse was
after 14 years of grand larceny.

1268
02:19:07,297 --> 02:19:09,506
You won't get your hooks into me.

1269
02:19:10,050 --> 02:19:14,762
That's right. That's right.
Sit next to your boyfriend. Jezebel.

1270
02:19:14,929 --> 02:19:17,056
Charley was increasingly superstitious...

1271
02:19:17,223 --> 02:19:19,933
...increasingly subject
to the advice of soothsayers...

1272
02:19:20,101 --> 02:19:24,104
...who promised to cure his miseries
with pipe smoke and poultices.

1273
02:19:24,272 --> 02:19:27,566
You been spending too much time
with Gypsies, Charley.

1274
02:19:33,281 --> 02:19:34,615
Shit.

1275
02:19:38,953 --> 02:19:41,538
The picture's awful dusty.

1276
02:19:41,956 --> 02:19:45,793
Something began to change
in Charley's stage portrayal of Jesse.

1277
02:19:45,960 --> 02:19:48,504
His gait seemed more practiced.

1278
02:19:48,671 --> 02:19:51,965
His voice was spookily similar
to the man's.

1279
02:19:52,133 --> 02:19:54,551
His newly suggested dialogue
was analogous...

1280
02:19:54,719 --> 02:19:57,763
...to a script Jesse might have originated.

1281
02:20:00,558 --> 02:20:02,976
He began to look at his younger brother
with spite...

1282
02:20:03,144 --> 02:20:05,813
...as if he suspected that
in some future performance...

1283
02:20:05,980 --> 02:20:10,484
...he might present himself
to a live cartridge in Robert Ford's gun.

1284
02:20:11,820 --> 02:20:13,654
Murderer!

1285
02:20:13,988 --> 02:20:15,739
Cur!

1286
02:20:16,366 --> 02:20:18,158
Coward!

1287
02:20:21,663 --> 02:20:26,208
You wanna investigate my courage?
Do you?

1288
02:20:26,626 --> 02:20:30,379
Find out! Find out!

1289
02:20:35,009 --> 02:20:36,885
Nobody.

1290
02:20:51,484 --> 02:20:53,277
Coward!

1291
02:21:18,470 --> 02:21:24,057
By his own approximation, Bob
assassinated Jesse James over 800 times.

1292
02:21:24,225 --> 02:21:27,978
He suspected no one in history
had ever so often or so publicly...

1293
02:21:28,146 --> 02:21:31,356
...recapitulated an act of betrayal.

1294
02:21:36,571 --> 02:21:39,323
Bob always challenged
the allegations of cowardice...

1295
02:21:39,491 --> 02:21:42,409
...but Charley seemed
to agree with them.

1296
02:21:42,702 --> 02:21:46,455
He spoke of Mrs. Zee James
as certain priests might the Madonna...

1297
02:21:46,623 --> 02:21:49,750
...and composed long soul-describing letters
to her...

1298
02:21:49,918 --> 02:21:52,085
...begging her forgiveness...

1299
02:21:53,421 --> 02:21:56,006
...none of which he mailed.

1300
02:22:23,868 --> 02:22:29,456
Charley Ford became all that his countrymen
wanted an assassin of Jesse James to be.

1301
02:22:33,753 --> 02:22:39,633
Jesse James was a man
Who killed many men

1302
02:22:40,802 --> 02:22:45,264
He robbed the Glendale train

1303
02:22:45,473 --> 02:22:51,311
And he stole from the rich
And he gave to the poor

1304
02:22:51,563 --> 02:22:56,483
He had a hand
And a heart and a brain

1305
02:22:57,318 --> 02:23:02,823
Well, Jesse had a wife
To mourn for his life

1306
02:23:02,991 --> 02:23:08,078
Three children
They were brave

1307
02:23:08,246 --> 02:23:13,834
But that dirty little coward
Who shot Mr. Howard

1308
02:23:14,085 --> 02:23:19,172
Has laid Jesse James in his grave

1309
02:23:20,216 --> 02:23:25,220
It was Robert Ford
That dirty little coward

1310
02:23:25,972 --> 02:23:30,350
I wonder how does he feel

1311
02:23:30,518 --> 02:23:36,273
For he ate at Jesse's bread
And he slept in Jesse's bed

1312
02:23:36,441 --> 02:23:41,486
And he laid poor Jesse in his grave

1313
02:23:41,946 --> 02:23:47,492
Well, Jesse had a wife
To mourn for his life

1314
02:23:47,660 --> 02:23:52,539
Three children
They were brave

1315
02:23:52,707 --> 02:23:58,378
But that dirty little coward
Who shot Mr. Howard

1316
02:23:58,546 --> 02:24:02,716
Has laid poor Jesse in his grave

1317
02:24:14,228 --> 02:24:16,271
I'm Robert Ford.

1318
02:24:26,991 --> 02:24:30,744
It was two children, not three.

1319
02:24:42,090 --> 02:24:43,423
Hey.

1320
02:24:44,342 --> 02:24:46,927
You get yourself home, son, okay?

1321
02:24:47,595 --> 02:24:51,640
Come on. Get out of here.
Get out of my place.

1322
02:25:23,423 --> 02:25:25,632
He thought, at his angriest...

1323
02:25:25,800 --> 02:25:29,553
...about visiting the kin
of Jesse's slaughtered victims:

1324
02:25:31,514 --> 02:25:34,808
Mrs. William Westfall in Plattsburg...

1325
02:25:37,311 --> 02:25:40,397
...the Wymore family in Clay County...

1326
02:25:45,528 --> 02:25:49,823
...perhaps even Mrs. Joseph Heywood
in Northfield, Minnesota.

1327
02:25:52,910 --> 02:25:55,912
He would go to their homes
and give his name as Robert Ford...

1328
02:25:56,080 --> 02:25:59,040
...the man who killed Jesse James.

1329
02:26:00,501 --> 02:26:03,545
He imagined they would
be grateful to him.

1330
02:26:54,514 --> 02:26:59,518
It was only with Dorothy Evans
that Bob spoke revealingly or plainly...

1331
02:26:59,685 --> 02:27:04,105
...and it was with her that he spoke of
things he didn't know he knew.

1332
02:27:25,753 --> 02:27:29,840
He told her that he had no real memory
of the shooting and its aftermath.

1333
02:27:30,007 --> 02:27:33,885
He could remember lifting the gun
that Jesse had given him...

1334
02:27:34,595 --> 02:27:38,640
...and then it was Good Friday and he was
reading about the funeral proceedings...

1335
02:27:38,808 --> 02:27:41,351
...as if they'd happened a long time ago.

1336
02:27:42,937 --> 02:27:45,063
Why did you kill him?

1337
02:27:49,360 --> 02:27:51,403
Well, he was gonna kill me.

1338
02:27:56,617 --> 02:27:59,828
So you were scared
and that's the only reason?

1339
02:28:02,582 --> 02:28:03,957
Yeah.

1340
02:28:04,458 --> 02:28:06,501
And the reward money.

1341
02:28:12,300 --> 02:28:15,135
Do you want me to change the subject?

1342
02:28:23,311 --> 02:28:25,645
You know what I expected?

1343
02:28:26,689 --> 02:28:28,690
Applause.

1344
02:28:31,277 --> 02:28:35,447
I was only 20 years old then.
I couldn't see how it would look to people.

1345
02:28:39,535 --> 02:28:42,203
I was surprised by what happened.

1346
02:28:43,289 --> 02:28:45,248
They didn't applaud.

1347
02:28:48,669 --> 02:28:50,545
He was ashamed of his boasting...

1348
02:28:50,713 --> 02:28:53,590
...his pretensions of courage
and ruthlessness.

1349
02:28:53,883 --> 02:28:57,677
He was sorry about his cold-bloodedness,
his dispassion...

1350
02:28:59,305 --> 02:29:03,683
...his inability to express
what he now believed was the case:

1351
02:29:06,270 --> 02:29:09,314
That he truly regretted killing Jesse...

1352
02:29:10,066 --> 02:29:13,068
...that he missed the man
as much as anybody...

1353
02:29:13,611 --> 02:29:16,738
...and wished his murder
hadn't been necessary.

1354
02:29:36,217 --> 02:29:38,301
Even as he circulated his saloon...

1355
02:29:38,469 --> 02:29:42,222
...he knew that the smiles disappeared
when he passed by.

1356
02:29:43,349 --> 02:29:45,183
He received so many menacing letters...

1357
02:29:45,351 --> 02:29:48,770
...that he could read them
without any reaction except curiosity.

1358
02:29:52,566 --> 02:29:57,404
He kept to his apartment all day,
flipping over playing cards...

1359
02:29:58,906 --> 02:30:03,410
...looking at his destiny
in every king and jack.

1360
02:30:07,581 --> 02:30:11,918
Edward O'Kelly came up from Bachelor
at 1 p.m. on the 8th.

1361
02:30:13,379 --> 02:30:17,298
He had no grand scheme, no strategy...

1362
02:30:17,466 --> 02:30:19,884
...no agreement with higher authorities...

1363
02:30:20,052 --> 02:30:22,804
...nothing beyond
a vague longing for glory...

1364
02:30:23,889 --> 02:30:28,143
...and a generalized wish
for revenge against Robert Ford.

1365
02:30:35,943 --> 02:30:39,195
- How'd it go last night?
- Not so bad.

1366
02:30:42,450 --> 02:30:43,825
The other one.

1367
02:30:46,328 --> 02:30:49,122
Edward O'Kelly would be ordered
to serve a life sentence...

1368
02:30:49,290 --> 02:30:52,167
...in the Colorado Penitentiary
for second-degree murder.

1369
02:30:52,334 --> 02:30:55,128
Over 7000 signatures
would eventually be gathered...

1370
02:30:55,296 --> 02:30:57,547
...on a petition asking for
O'Kelly's release...

1371
02:30:57,715 --> 02:31:02,719
...and in 1902, Governor James B. Orman
would pardon the man.

1372
02:31:03,304 --> 02:31:07,724
You shouldn't be wearing that stickpin
again there, Bob. Opals are unlucky.

1373
02:31:09,143 --> 02:31:13,354
My luck's not very good as it is. I don't
think an opal's gonna change that much.

1374
02:31:14,315 --> 02:31:15,732
I hear you.

1375
02:31:29,330 --> 02:31:31,164
There would be no eulogies for Bob...

1376
02:31:32,875 --> 02:31:37,003
...no photographs of his body
would be sold in sundries stores...

1377
02:31:37,671 --> 02:31:42,050
...no people would crowd the streets
in the rain to see his funeral cortege...

1378
02:31:43,803 --> 02:31:46,763
...no biographies would be written
about him...

1379
02:31:46,931 --> 02:31:49,516
...no children named after him.

1380
02:31:51,060 --> 02:31:55,814
No one would ever pay 25 cents
to stand in the rooms he grew up in.

1381
02:32:00,361 --> 02:32:02,070
Hello, Bob.

1382
02:32:03,531 --> 02:32:07,700
The shotgun would ignite,
and Ella Mae would scream...

1383
02:32:08,536 --> 02:32:12,205
...but Robert Ford would only lay
on the floor and look at the ceiling...

1384
02:32:12,373 --> 02:32:14,874
...the light going out of his eyes...

1385
02:32:15,042 --> 02:32:17,752
...before he could find the right words.

1386
02:39:36,483 --> 02:39:38,484
