1
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:45,345
The rabbit-hole went straight on
like a tunnel for some way...

2
00:00:45,554 --> 00:00:47,682
and then dipped suddenly down.

3
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:53,398
So suddenly that Alice had not a moment
to think about stopping herself...

4
00:00:53,566 --> 00:00:56,152
before she found herself falling down...

5
00:00:56,319 --> 00:00:58,697
what seemed to be a very deep well.

6
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:04,787
Either the well was very deep,
or she fell very slowly...

7
00:01:05,248 --> 00:01:10,629
for she had plenty of time as she
went down to look about her...

8
00:01:10,838 --> 00:01:14,385
and to wonder
what was gonna happen next...

9
00:01:21,394 --> 00:01:25,317
You bend so that you don't break

10
00:01:25,984 --> 00:01:29,406
You give but then you can't take

11
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:33,411
Those wise eyes of yours

12
00:01:33,912 --> 00:01:37,165
Those big skies of yours

13
00:01:37,584 --> 00:01:40,879
My sweet honey rose

14
00:01:41,046 --> 00:01:44,384
Strange dark flower rose

15
00:01:44,718 --> 00:01:45,885
Jeliza-Rose

16
00:01:55,733 --> 00:01:58,611
One, two, three, four...

17
00:01:59,531 --> 00:02:01,908
No, that...

18
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,537
You must be Titania.

19
00:02:04,703 --> 00:02:06,206
Hi, Titania.

20
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:10,586
It's me, Jeliza-Rose.
And this is Mustique.

21
00:02:11,254 --> 00:02:14,259
I'm just as excited as anything.

22
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:17,972
Cos today,
we're all going on a great trip.

23
00:02:27,985 --> 00:02:31,323
Sexual ambush in the new wild west

24
00:02:31,657 --> 00:02:34,703
God is a camera, baby,
show us more breast

25
00:02:34,911 --> 00:02:38,790
For every name in a star
on that dirty boulevard

26
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,337
Ten thousand others got shot
through the heart

27
00:02:42,754 --> 00:02:45,843
The Isles of the Dutchman,
it's calling

28
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:49,430
His perfume and money
is the smell of sin

29
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:52,978
Miss September gave it up
to Robin Hood

30
00:02:53,145 --> 00:02:57,859
The day Vincent Van Gogh
came to Hollywood

31
00:02:59,611 --> 00:03:01,572
And here's my impression of it all

32
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:27,525
What's in Denmark?

33
00:03:28,026 --> 00:03:30,361
When you ever been there, anyway?

34
00:03:30,905 --> 00:03:34,909
It's just something stupid
you've got in your head. Jutland.

35
00:03:35,117 --> 00:03:36,370
Jutland.

36
00:03:37,538 --> 00:03:41,293
Jutland. It's called Jutland.

37
00:03:42,711 --> 00:03:47,175
- It's where we're headed.
- The Viking land of marsh and fjords...

38
00:03:48,219 --> 00:03:49,638
and weird light.

39
00:03:51,223 --> 00:03:53,350
I see dark banks...

40
00:03:53,644 --> 00:03:56,396
decorated by the most beautiful flies.

41
00:03:56,605 --> 00:03:59,150
Where do you get
all of these crappy ideas, anyway?

42
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,945
Oh, I'm just thinking of a place
without a phone.

43
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,157
Nobody could hound me then.

44
00:04:05,367 --> 00:04:08,830
They won't find me,
or you or Jeliza-Rose.

45
00:04:09,038 --> 00:04:11,667
Fuck that, Noah, I ain't going.

46
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:15,673
- So don't even bother trying. Stupid.
- Whatever you want.

47
00:04:17,718 --> 00:04:21,264
Guess me and Jeliza-Rose
will make the trip. How's that?

48
00:04:21,514 --> 00:04:23,100
You know what, Noah...

49
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:27,771
you and that little shit-critter
can leave whenever you want.

50
00:04:28,024 --> 00:04:30,026
I don't care.

51
00:04:31,987 --> 00:04:36,451
When you're done with daddy
come upstairs and do my legs, okay?

52
00:04:37,329 --> 00:04:38,163
Okay, mama.

53
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:39,663
Thanks, sweetheart.

54
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:41,750
Did you know...

55
00:04:42,418 --> 00:04:44,127
that King Harold...

56
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:47,423
he promised to marry
the Norse Queen, Gunhilda...

57
00:04:47,675 --> 00:04:49,636
and enticed her to Jutland.

58
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:53,766
Then on her arrival she got drowned
in a bog instead.

59
00:04:55,978 --> 00:04:57,646
Not very nice, is it?

60
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:01,026
No, not very nice.

61
00:05:01,276 --> 00:05:03,237
No. Think she deserved it?

62
00:05:03,781 --> 00:05:04,740
No.

63
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:08,327
I guess she didn't.

64
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:13,584
Thank you, sweetie.

65
00:05:19,302 --> 00:05:20,427
Yeah...

66
00:05:21,764 --> 00:05:22,889
time for...

67
00:05:24,475 --> 00:05:25,810
for daddy to...

68
00:05:28,314 --> 00:05:30,274
go on a little vacation.

69
00:06:00,357 --> 00:06:01,774
I say poor me.

70
00:06:03,403 --> 00:06:06,699
Danish folk greet the May sunrise.

71
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:13,083
Daddy...

72
00:06:14,502 --> 00:06:17,004
is Jutland like the Prairies?

73
00:06:41,579 --> 00:06:44,750
It's your daddy's fault
you're the way you are, not mine.

74
00:06:45,336 --> 00:06:46,963
Because I loved you.

75
00:06:47,545 --> 00:06:50,466
Lip-smacking little junkie baby.

76
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:53,553
Irritable and hyperactive, you was.

77
00:06:53,764 --> 00:06:57,394
Just twitching and spasms
and convulsions.

78
00:06:58,435 --> 00:07:02,233
Your daddy blew smoke in your face
to keep you quiet, you know that?

79
00:07:04,569 --> 00:07:07,949
I think it would damage you,
but don't blame me...

80
00:07:08,367 --> 00:07:10,911
I breast-fed you forever.

81
00:07:12,247 --> 00:07:15,166
Jeliza-Rose, you know I love you,
don't you?

82
00:07:17,795 --> 00:07:19,714
I'm sorry, baby.

83
00:07:19,882 --> 00:07:24,637
I'm gonna do something real nice
for you real soon some day, I promise.

84
00:07:27,059 --> 00:07:28,560
- Sure, mama. - Baby...

85
00:07:31,981 --> 00:07:35,403
and I want you...
What the fuck are you doing?

86
00:07:35,612 --> 00:07:39,576
How many times have I told you to stay
away from my chocolate, you little bitch?

87
00:07:40,745 --> 00:07:41,870
Oh, honey.

88
00:07:47,086 --> 00:07:51,591
I don't want you to leave me,
Jeliza-Rose.

89
00:07:52,927 --> 00:07:57,391
I can't get by without you, Jeliza-Rose.

90
00:07:59,978 --> 00:08:02,189
Down, down, down.

91
00:08:02,564 --> 00:08:05,192
Would the fall never come to an end?

92
00:08:05,653 --> 00:08:09,033
"I wonder how many miles I've fallen
by this time?"

93
00:08:09,492 --> 00:08:11,285
Alice said aloud.

94
00:08:12,161 --> 00:08:15,875
"I must be getting somewhere near
the centre of the earth."

95
00:08:30,853 --> 00:08:32,648
Jeliza-Rose, wake up.

96
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:36,653
Wake up. Listen.
You should know this before I forget.

97
00:08:36,903 --> 00:08:38,279
The bog waters...

98
00:08:38,823 --> 00:08:41,786
they have weird powers.
They leave these bodies...

99
00:08:42,161 --> 00:08:47,418
in bogs for thousands of years
and they don't decay. They just...

100
00:08:47,668 --> 00:08:50,296
Well, they may get a little shrunk
and stuff. Honey, listen to me now.

101
00:08:50,505 --> 00:08:52,674
Come here, try to understand this.
Lookee here.

102
00:08:52,884 --> 00:08:54,635
There he is, look, see him...

103
00:08:55,095 --> 00:08:57,764
that man was murdered
two thousand years ago.

104
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:00,561
You're looking at somebody
deader than dirt.

105
00:09:01,687 --> 00:09:03,023
Who killed him?

106
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:05,442
Well, I don't know.

107
00:09:05,692 --> 00:09:11,158
Let's just hope we're in that kind of
shape in two thousand years.

108
00:09:12,702 --> 00:09:13,953
Look at him.

109
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,913
He's just...

110
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:18,000
he's just lying there...

111
00:09:18,418 --> 00:09:20,504
waiting to come back to life.

112
00:09:23,259 --> 00:09:26,596
Okay. That's what I wanted to tell you.
Goodnight, baby.

113
00:09:27,181 --> 00:09:29,099
Straight to sleep now,
or else your mum...

114
00:09:29,267 --> 00:09:32,062
and all the bog men in the world
will come chasing after you.

115
00:09:33,898 --> 00:09:35,566
- Dad! - What?

116
00:09:35,817 --> 00:09:36,902
Daddy...

117
00:09:37,778 --> 00:09:40,573
could you leave the light on tonight,
please?

118
00:09:40,783 --> 00:09:42,116
Sure, baby. You got it.

119
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:20,376
It was the methadone that killed her.

120
00:10:21,169 --> 00:10:23,130
Should have kept her on the junk.

121
00:10:25,301 --> 00:10:28,389
I should have just cut her dose
and kept her on it.

122
00:10:28,596 --> 00:10:30,015
Now she's dead and...

123
00:10:31,018 --> 00:10:32,476
I don't have a car.

124
00:10:33,604 --> 00:10:35,313
Please don't be sad.

125
00:10:37,484 --> 00:10:39,903
Now we can eat all her choc bars.

126
00:10:41,365 --> 00:10:43,658
Look... here they are.

127
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:48,289
No, no one's gonna take you from me,
sweetie.

128
00:10:48,499 --> 00:10:52,086
That's not happening here. Huh?
Now, we're leaving.

129
00:10:52,422 --> 00:10:54,923
Okay? We're gonna go off
to the prairies.

130
00:10:55,176 --> 00:10:58,096
- Okay?
- We can go to Jutland.

131
00:10:58,889 --> 00:11:00,639
Wouldn't that be wonderful.

132
00:11:01,267 --> 00:11:05,688
All right, is there anything
you wanna say?

133
00:11:06,441 --> 00:11:09,068
- Mum's dead all right.
- Maybe we should...

134
00:11:09,445 --> 00:11:11,947
give Queen Gunhilda
a real send-off...

135
00:11:12,198 --> 00:11:14,533
will all the things she loved, yeah.

136
00:11:18,081 --> 00:11:20,500
There'd be horses on there and...

137
00:11:21,336 --> 00:11:23,629
- Yeah. - Some of these.

138
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:26,927
- Plates of gold. Come on, honey.
- These too.

139
00:11:27,802 --> 00:11:29,804
Okay. Yeah, that's it.
What else did she love on there?

140
00:11:30,014 --> 00:11:33,143
- Shoes.
- Oh yeah, she loved shoes, that's it.

141
00:11:33,684 --> 00:11:37,606
That's it. Lay her to rest on a...

142
00:11:37,982 --> 00:11:39,567
a Viking ship.

143
00:11:43,783 --> 00:11:46,451
Yeah... set her on fire.

144
00:11:48,831 --> 00:11:52,378
Adrift the great misty fjords at dawn.

145
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:54,965
No, no, sweetie, sweetie!

146
00:11:56,259 --> 00:11:58,177
- Maybe it's a bad idea.
- Come on now.

147
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:01,514
You might burn up the whole building
and everyone else.

148
00:12:02,558 --> 00:12:03,851
Yeah, you're right.

149
00:12:05,145 --> 00:12:06,438
Let's go.

150
00:12:09,609 --> 00:12:11,528
Don't stare, it's bad luck.
Come on.

151
00:12:19,749 --> 00:12:23,879
Not it. No, no, come on.
Let's do this damn thing.

152
00:12:25,465 --> 00:12:28,051
Gotta monitor the information
as it develops.

153
00:12:29,636 --> 00:12:33,475
The bog men... they'll be looking for me
when they find mum.

154
00:12:33,683 --> 00:12:35,144
Probably already found her.

155
00:12:41,028 --> 00:12:43,990
I'm not gonna be safe until we get to
Grandma's house.

156
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:47,995
Think mum will keep falling
until she falls right through the earth?

157
00:12:48,287 --> 00:12:53,793
Got to get rid of the squirrels in the attic
because they're chewing the wiring.

158
00:12:54,044 --> 00:12:56,630
They make a terrible racket
in the morning.

159
00:12:57,008 --> 00:12:58,927
One bit me once.

160
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:02,807
Me and my cousin,
we beat it dead with a bat.

161
00:13:03,307 --> 00:13:05,769
But not before that sucker tried
climbing my pant leg...

162
00:13:05,977 --> 00:13:09,232
all crazy mad, getting itself
tangled in my hair.

163
00:13:10,149 --> 00:13:13,071
Sinking it's big yellow teeth
into my scalp...

164
00:13:14,322 --> 00:13:15,908
tearing at everything.

165
00:13:18,245 --> 00:13:20,038
Nothing. Nothing.

166
00:13:24,754 --> 00:13:27,841
Well, Noah isn't even worth
a headline any more.

167
00:13:28,299 --> 00:13:30,009
Yeah, I'm a nobody.

168
00:13:30,971 --> 00:13:32,972
Shall I read some more?

169
00:13:33,265 --> 00:13:35,684
Yeah, sweetie,
that would be nice. Read.

170
00:13:37,479 --> 00:13:40,065
"Well!" Thought Alice to herself.

171
00:13:40,274 --> 00:13:42,860
Your grandma, she liked the squirrels.

172
00:13:43,236 --> 00:13:45,739
She said the place didn't feel
so lonesome that way.

173
00:14:07,729 --> 00:14:08,855
Jeez.

174
00:14:09,523 --> 00:14:11,609
Oh, mama,
where are you when I need you?

175
00:14:13,235 --> 00:14:15,197
Wish I'd met grandma.

176
00:14:15,947 --> 00:14:18,493
She was a wonderful woman,
your grandma, but...

177
00:14:18,869 --> 00:14:22,749
Queen Gunhilda said
"Fuck that. Fuck that." she said.

178
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:23,875
Really!

179
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:25,878
I wanted to take you, all right.

180
00:14:26,212 --> 00:14:27,923
- We're going there now, right?
- Sure we are.

181
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:30,424
- I told you. Hey...
- We are, aren't we?

182
00:14:30,676 --> 00:14:34,222
Sweetie, this is just the first stage.
You and me...

183
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:39,020
we're on our travels, honey.
We're going across the ocean to Jutland.

184
00:14:40,524 --> 00:14:42,484
You and me, okay?

185
00:14:46,865 --> 00:14:50,495
Jeliza-Rose. Was that you making
those air biscuits? Cutting air muffins?

186
00:14:50,745 --> 00:14:51,995
Oh man, that's nasty.

187
00:14:52,206 --> 00:14:53,499
It isn't me!

188
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:57,797
You should move to China. Over there,
the louder the burp, the better the meal.

189
00:14:58,004 --> 00:15:00,591
A powerful air biscuits delivered with
grace would get you free dessert.

190
00:15:00,926 --> 00:15:02,469
That's gross!

191
00:15:04,682 --> 00:15:09,354
There you go again. It's a regular
art form with you. Put a plug in it, please.

192
00:15:09,645 --> 00:15:11,730
Don't. It's you!

193
00:15:12,191 --> 00:15:14,485
You're doing it. Stop it!

194
00:15:16,197 --> 00:15:17,282
Stop.

195
00:15:18,993 --> 00:15:20,452
Serve you right.

196
00:15:26,751 --> 00:15:28,421
For the love of Mike.

197
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,320
- Awfully kind of you.
- No problem.

198
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:48,405
Come on, sweetie. Watch it now.

199
00:15:50,243 --> 00:15:51,495
Watch your step.

200
00:15:57,336 --> 00:15:59,922
Wow. Is that it?

201
00:16:01,509 --> 00:16:02,634
Yeah.

202
00:16:07,182 --> 00:16:09,351
Go on. Go on through.

203
00:16:17,864 --> 00:16:21,619
Place needs a little work.
Wants a new well.

204
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:23,620
No problem.

205
00:16:25,123 --> 00:16:26,166
Look.

206
00:16:37,932 --> 00:16:39,768
Yard needs some tending.

207
00:16:40,061 --> 00:16:43,899
Damn weeds...
they get the better of everything.

208
00:16:51,784 --> 00:16:53,662
Nails coming up on the porch.

209
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:57,375
We can hammer them back down.

210
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:03,384
Yeah, your grandma,
had this boy mow and weed.

211
00:17:03,634 --> 00:17:06,095
I suppose that fella's all grown-up by now.

212
00:17:12,396 --> 00:17:15,150
Hey, ma! I'm home!

213
00:17:16,527 --> 00:17:19,615
Home at last! Go on in.

214
00:17:20,073 --> 00:17:22,075
Go on. Go on.

215
00:17:33,549 --> 00:17:34,759
Vandals.

216
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,021
Where's my room?

217
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:46,651
Up with the Gods.

218
00:19:27,163 --> 00:19:28,623
Mustique...

219
00:19:30,709 --> 00:19:32,586
Sateen Lips...

220
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,259
Baby Blonde...

221
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:41,181
and Glitter Gal.

222
00:19:41,974 --> 00:19:43,101
Hi, guys.

223
00:20:12,266 --> 00:20:15,854
I'm dying. I can't go on.

224
00:20:16,646 --> 00:20:18,691
I must go on.

225
00:20:20,402 --> 00:20:24,699
You will survive.
A complete recovery is expected.

226
00:20:26,201 --> 00:20:29,372
Thank you, thank you, doctor.

227
00:20:29,624 --> 00:20:33,628
You've given me hope. I shall live.

228
00:20:34,378 --> 00:20:35,923
Oh, doctor.

229
00:20:36,548 --> 00:20:37,674
Doctor.

230
00:20:49,858 --> 00:20:52,612
Now, you don't go short-changing
daddy, will you, sweetheart?

231
00:20:53,989 --> 00:20:54,990
I won't.

232
00:20:57,702 --> 00:20:59,247
Don't you worry.

233
00:20:59,747 --> 00:21:01,707
Oh, time for daddy's vacation.

234
00:21:03,211 --> 00:21:05,255
Not too long this time, daddy.

235
00:21:05,588 --> 00:21:08,299
Oh no. Just a little vacation.

236
00:21:09,844 --> 00:21:12,263
Daddy's going deep sea diving.

237
00:21:13,473 --> 00:21:15,851
Going to the place
where dreams are made.

238
00:21:20,733 --> 00:21:21,777
Thanks, honey.

239
00:21:27,994 --> 00:21:29,288
And daddy...

240
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:32,290
daddy's gonna stroll down that...

241
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:35,295
far subterranean shore...

242
00:21:35,837 --> 00:21:39,259
all littered with flotsam of
hopes and dreams.

243
00:22:01,914 --> 00:22:03,375
Oh, I see them.

244
00:22:08,507 --> 00:22:10,593
Relics of ancient times...

245
00:22:15,099 --> 00:22:16,977
Ionely cenotaphs...

246
00:22:17,938 --> 00:22:21,692
standing along that melancholy tideland.

247
00:24:24,733 --> 00:24:28,948
What are you saying?
I don't understand what you're saying.

248
00:24:31,411 --> 00:24:32,537
Come back.

249
00:24:32,744 --> 00:24:35,455
You'll get in trouble.
You shouldn't be in there.

250
00:24:35,665 --> 00:24:38,042
People don't like squirrels in the attic.

251
00:24:40,881 --> 00:24:44,260
I'm not telling you a secret
because you wouldn't like it.

252
00:25:00,825 --> 00:25:01,909
He's in the room.

253
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:05,999
Are you ready, Mustique?

254
00:25:06,915 --> 00:25:08,835
I was born ready.

255
00:25:09,002 --> 00:25:11,964
Good, because this could get
pretty dangerous.

256
00:25:13,425 --> 00:25:16,721
Bring Sateen Lips with us.
She can help.

257
00:25:18,097 --> 00:25:21,978
- I don't wanna go.
- Shut up, you baby.

258
00:25:25,067 --> 00:25:28,278
Why can't Baby Blonde,
or Glitter Gal do it instead?

259
00:25:28,488 --> 00:25:33,618
Keep complaining and me and
Jeliza-Rose will cut off all your hair!

260
00:25:33,869 --> 00:25:38,416
Please don't. I'll behave.

261
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:40,796
You better.

262
00:25:42,964 --> 00:25:45,844
I'm sure he's here somewhere.

263
00:25:46,136 --> 00:25:48,138
Maybe he's magic.

264
00:25:49,141 --> 00:25:51,769
Maybe he's really a fairy.

265
00:25:53,105 --> 00:25:54,897
Don't be silly.

266
00:25:55,732 --> 00:25:58,403
Only lightning bugs are like fairies.

267
00:25:59,445 --> 00:26:02,409
Squirrel butts don't glow.

268
00:26:04,412 --> 00:26:05,663
He's in the wall.

269
00:26:07,124 --> 00:26:10,252
He's right here.

270
00:26:13,507 --> 00:26:15,425
He's gone through to the next room!

271
00:26:16,385 --> 00:26:19,515
Don't go in there. I'm scared.

272
00:26:19,849 --> 00:26:23,395
What did I tell you? Safe as houses.

273
00:26:23,604 --> 00:26:25,189
I'm still scared.

274
00:26:36,038 --> 00:26:38,624
That squirrel can't hide from me!

275
00:26:44,549 --> 00:26:48,763
We're going in... right, Jeliza-Rose?

276
00:26:49,388 --> 00:26:50,766
Right.

277
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:03,491
But I'm still scared, Jeliza-Rose.

278
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:09,040
If we're not back in an hour,
then come after us...

279
00:27:09,375 --> 00:27:10,835
because it means...

280
00:27:11,795 --> 00:27:13,837
we're being pulverized.

281
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:21,140
It's like a cave.

282
00:27:24,686 --> 00:27:30,152
It's grandma's stuff!
Yeah... that's what it is.

283
00:27:30,987 --> 00:27:33,615
Let's taka a look at those boxes.

284
00:27:35,035 --> 00:27:36,161
No.

285
00:27:36,996 --> 00:27:38,248
Scared!

286
00:27:38,455 --> 00:27:41,251
What's so spooky about boxes?

287
00:27:42,461 --> 00:27:45,423
It's the treasure chest that's spooky.

288
00:27:48,302 --> 00:27:50,681
Bet there's slippers...

289
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:52,683
and gold in it.

290
00:27:56,647 --> 00:27:58,107
Or a dead thing.

291
00:28:14,588 --> 00:28:16,673
It's just old clothes.

292
00:28:18,594 --> 00:28:19,803
See.

293
00:28:52,098 --> 00:28:54,267
I bet she was beautiful.

294
00:28:54,476 --> 00:28:57,855
- She was old!
- She was my grandma!

295
00:28:58,065 --> 00:29:02,362
She was old and ugly
with boxes of squirrel-chewed junk!

296
00:29:02,528 --> 00:29:06,700
You're lying. Shut up or we're leaving.

297
00:29:20,846 --> 00:29:22,346
That's what happened.

298
00:29:25,183 --> 00:29:27,353
We've turned into squirrels.

299
00:29:42,834 --> 00:29:44,919
There's Jeliza-Rose.

300
00:29:45,921 --> 00:29:48,089
She's looking for us.

301
00:29:57,186 --> 00:30:00,398
Boom boom boom boom
I'm gonna shoot you right down

302
00:30:00,607 --> 00:30:01,525
Daddy?

303
00:30:03,236 --> 00:30:05,614
Right offa your feet

304
00:30:06,199 --> 00:30:08,701
Take you home with me

305
00:30:09,662 --> 00:30:11,580
I had a bad dream.

306
00:30:12,625 --> 00:30:14,501
Boom boom boom boom

307
00:30:24,848 --> 00:30:26,809
I love to see you strut

308
00:30:27,144 --> 00:30:29,521
Still on vacation, daddy?

309
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:32,317
When you talking to me

310
00:30:33,443 --> 00:30:35,028
That baby talk

311
00:30:36,405 --> 00:30:38,951
I like it like that

312
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:42,248
Whoa, yeah!

313
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:44,709
Talk that talk

314
00:30:45,251 --> 00:30:46,961
Walk that walk

315
00:31:10,996 --> 00:31:12,288
Morning.

316
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,526
I'm hungry.

317
00:31:41,913 --> 00:31:44,750
This is Radio Jeliza-Rose.

318
00:31:45,334 --> 00:31:48,086
Are you receiving me?
Over.

319
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:54,095
This is Radio Jeliza-Rose.

320
00:31:54,304 --> 00:31:57,767
Am I coming in loud and clear?
Over.

321
00:32:15,541 --> 00:32:17,460
Won't talk to you too.

322
00:32:18,086 --> 00:32:20,213
It's not nice, you know.

323
00:32:21,007 --> 00:32:22,759
You wouldn't like it too.

324
00:32:27,057 --> 00:32:28,099
Get off!

325
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:33,982
Die, die, die!

326
00:32:38,072 --> 00:32:40,074
It's clear. All clear.

327
00:32:43,746 --> 00:32:45,957
Now... we mustn't sing or talk...

328
00:32:46,875 --> 00:32:50,547
or we'll spook the fairies...
and they won't come.

329
00:32:50,756 --> 00:32:52,633
I have to see them.

330
00:32:55,011 --> 00:32:59,433
Probably they won't be out
till tonight anyway.

331
00:33:13,996 --> 00:33:17,584
Lift me up sweet Jesus

332
00:33:17,834 --> 00:33:21,297
Nail me by his crooked cross

333
00:33:21,548 --> 00:33:26,095
Oh what a glorious day

334
00:33:26,346 --> 00:33:27,596
A ghost.

335
00:33:27,847 --> 00:33:31,310
She was killed in this very bus.

336
00:33:32,355 --> 00:33:34,272
All burned bad.

337
00:33:34,523 --> 00:33:37,151
That's why her face is covered up.

338
00:33:39,197 --> 00:33:43,326
Maybe she's a queen...
and she got strangled.

339
00:33:43,869 --> 00:33:48,792
She's Queen Gunhilda.
She didn't want to stay dead any more.

340
00:33:51,087 --> 00:33:55,468
We have to go home.
We have to go tell daddy. Right now!

341
00:34:00,476 --> 00:34:02,269
We saw a ghost!

342
00:34:15,121 --> 00:34:16,873
We saw a ghost.

343
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,130
She was looking for something.

344
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,442
Get on with it, you little bitch.

345
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,213
I'm dying.

346
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:55,257
My tongue is filling my head.

347
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:59,306
I'm really dying this time.

348
00:35:00,641 --> 00:35:03,351
This is not a vacation.

349
00:35:05,563 --> 00:35:10,152
Dear, you're already dead.
You're a ghost. A spook.

350
00:35:15,036 --> 00:35:16,579
So beautiful too.

351
00:35:19,123 --> 00:35:20,458
I'm a vision.

352
00:35:20,793 --> 00:35:21,835
Dear...

353
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:27,302
promise me something, Jeliza-Rose.

354
00:35:32,851 --> 00:35:35,730
If I ever end up looking like Glitter Gal...

355
00:35:35,981 --> 00:35:38,233
promise you'll just kill me.

356
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,652
I couldn't.

357
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,447
I could never.

358
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:48,621
Oh, yes you could.

359
00:35:54,922 --> 00:35:56,925
You're a vision.

360
00:35:57,594 --> 00:35:59,679
You're a sensation.

361
00:36:03,851 --> 00:36:05,896
We're very proud of you.

362
00:36:07,773 --> 00:36:10,110
You're our beauty queen...

363
00:36:10,527 --> 00:36:14,657
and it's only right you look your best
for the seance.

364
00:36:22,126 --> 00:36:24,922
Now... hold hands.

365
00:36:27,425 --> 00:36:29,552
Mustique, you too.

366
00:36:31,097 --> 00:36:32,599
Ridiculous.

367
00:36:32,891 --> 00:36:36,188
Everyone close your eyes.

368
00:36:37,606 --> 00:36:41,902
The ghost is sending us a message.

369
00:36:42,278 --> 00:36:45,574
A psychic message.

370
00:36:45,824 --> 00:36:49,746
She wants something.

371
00:36:51,166 --> 00:36:52,708
Like what?

372
00:36:53,418 --> 00:36:55,797
A gift.

373
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:59,844
I could draw a picture, of you and me.

374
00:37:00,094 --> 00:37:02,347
Or give her Glitter Gal.

375
00:37:02,556 --> 00:37:04,266
Shut up, Mustique.

376
00:37:04,476 --> 00:37:05,978
Then what?

377
00:37:06,728 --> 00:37:11,025
Something only a dead person uses.

378
00:37:11,235 --> 00:37:13,695
The radio. It's dead.

379
00:37:13,905 --> 00:37:16,742
The dead can listen to ghost voices.

380
00:37:17,369 --> 00:37:19,704
And ghost music too.

381
00:37:21,248 --> 00:37:22,541
Except...

382
00:37:25,505 --> 00:37:28,592
daddy likes listening to music.

383
00:37:30,344 --> 00:37:32,972
First, we make an altar.

384
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:40,442
Jeliza-Rose, this is not going to work.

385
00:37:40,692 --> 00:37:42,443
Shut up, Mustique.

386
00:37:48,911 --> 00:37:51,956
Bog men are stirring.

387
00:37:52,166 --> 00:37:55,711
Let's go. Ghosts and monsters
are fast runners, remember?

388
00:37:55,961 --> 00:37:59,132
No, they aren't. Dead things are slow.

389
00:37:59,342 --> 00:38:01,552
You have to be alive to run.

390
00:38:04,097 --> 00:38:08,436
They get you...
when you're not expecting them.

391
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:11,275
What are you doing?

392
00:38:14,362 --> 00:38:16,530
What have you been messing with here?

393
00:38:17,699 --> 00:38:20,536
- Are you mute, vandal?
- I'm scared.

394
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:23,750
Ooh, vandal's scared.

395
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:25,670
I'm not a vandal.

396
00:38:27,005 --> 00:38:28,923
I'm Jeliza-Rose.

397
00:38:29,132 --> 00:38:30,717
Jeliza-Rose.

398
00:38:31,677 --> 00:38:33,096
Well...

399
00:38:34,514 --> 00:38:37,686
a vandal by any other name.
You understand?

400
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:43,110
Children. This is for me?

401
00:38:44,862 --> 00:38:46,072
It's a gift.

402
00:38:49,411 --> 00:38:51,079
Something useful.

403
00:38:56,711 --> 00:38:57,795
Any bees?

404
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:01,677
Go mess elsewhere.

405
00:39:03,179 --> 00:39:05,556
One sting and I'm paralyzed...
most likely dead.

406
00:39:05,849 --> 00:39:07,101
But you are dead.

407
00:39:08,228 --> 00:39:12,525
What a thing to say!
What kind of a child are you?

408
00:39:12,733 --> 00:39:15,193
- What I meant to say was...
- Well, you should say what you mean!

409
00:39:15,403 --> 00:39:16,612
- I do. - No, you don't!

410
00:39:16,864 --> 00:39:18,699
Meaning what you say
is something quite different.

411
00:39:18,867 --> 00:39:19,909
You might just as well have said...

412
00:39:20,161 --> 00:39:23,373
"I see what I eat" is the same as
"I eat what I see". Which it isn't.

413
00:39:23,914 --> 00:39:26,710
If you see a bee or you hear a bee,
you'll say so, right?

414
00:39:27,795 --> 00:39:30,257
If I'm stung and die, it'll be your fault.

415
00:39:37,391 --> 00:39:39,393
Stung in my own garden.

416
00:39:40,188 --> 00:39:42,023
Blinded by a bee.

417
00:39:42,273 --> 00:39:46,320
Revenge for destroying
my daddy's hives, I say.

418
00:39:47,114 --> 00:39:48,449
Poured gas on them.

419
00:39:48,865 --> 00:39:50,201
Set them ablaze.

420
00:39:52,036 --> 00:39:56,793
See my daddy, he loved his bees,
and they loved him, I'm sure.

421
00:39:57,503 --> 00:40:01,298
They is jealous creatures, though.
Hated my mama.

422
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:03,219
Pure evil.

423
00:40:07,809 --> 00:40:09,434
My mama's heart...

424
00:40:10,103 --> 00:40:11,396
just stopped.

425
00:40:12,523 --> 00:40:16,945
And we never ate apple pie again.
She was changed forever.

426
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:21,284
Now... there isn't a bee alive
that doesn't want me murdered.

427
00:40:21,536 --> 00:40:22,661
And this...

428
00:40:23,246 --> 00:40:26,291
this is revenge!

429
00:40:27,126 --> 00:40:28,836
A dead peeper.

430
00:40:29,088 --> 00:40:30,547
Dreadful, isn't it?

431
00:40:37,266 --> 00:40:38,224
Who's this?

432
00:40:39,684 --> 00:40:42,981
- This for me too?
- It's Mustique.

433
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,112
She's my friend.

434
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:50,282
Well, you should consider the company
you keep, I think. You take it.

435
00:40:52,702 --> 00:40:54,163
You be going now.

436
00:40:59,503 --> 00:41:01,840
You're not a real ghost, anyhow.

437
00:41:04,177 --> 00:41:05,552
Not yet.

438
00:41:18,947 --> 00:41:21,115
Maybe we'll meet again.

439
00:41:21,909 --> 00:41:26,248
I'll most probably come by here
tomorrow... around noon.

440
00:41:28,376 --> 00:41:31,172
Well, you can leave your friend behind,
she's trouble.

441
00:41:35,679 --> 00:41:36,721
Okay.

442
00:41:40,016 --> 00:41:41,268
Children!

443
00:41:41,936 --> 00:41:44,648
She doesn't hate me. She doesn't!

444
00:41:44,898 --> 00:41:47,735
Daddy! She doesn't hate me!

445
00:41:48,862 --> 00:41:50,739
She's not a ghost at all.

446
00:41:50,989 --> 00:41:54,786
Daddy, I think
she could be my new friend.

447
00:41:54,996 --> 00:41:57,416
She invited me to a picnic.

448
00:41:59,668 --> 00:42:01,545
The only thing is...

449
00:42:06,804 --> 00:42:09,181
she just wants me to go.

450
00:42:09,474 --> 00:42:11,893
She doesn't like Mustique...

451
00:42:12,144 --> 00:42:14,856
and I don't think she'd like the others.

452
00:42:23,909 --> 00:42:26,121
I'm going on my own.

453
00:42:31,253 --> 00:42:35,717
Sleep... dear little ones, sleep.

454
00:42:36,594 --> 00:42:37,971
You dream...

455
00:42:38,429 --> 00:42:42,434
of trains... of Eskimo pies...

456
00:42:42,686 --> 00:42:47,817
and old men dancing with bears.

457
00:43:41,932 --> 00:43:45,353
Lift me up sweet Jesus

458
00:43:45,646 --> 00:43:49,400
Lay me on His crooked cross

459
00:43:50,027 --> 00:43:54,824
Oh what a glorious day

460
00:43:55,034 --> 00:44:00,583
Have me down on my knees and pray

461
00:44:02,335 --> 00:44:06,007
Lift me up sweet Jesus

462
00:44:06,215 --> 00:44:10,012
Lay me on His crooked cross

463
00:44:34,128 --> 00:44:36,925
Kill a rabbit yourself, Dickens.

464
00:44:37,175 --> 00:44:38,967
I'm too busy today.

465
00:44:39,219 --> 00:44:43,432
Now, do you think you're the only person
with things to do?

466
00:44:43,682 --> 00:44:44,851
No, Dell, I can't!

467
00:44:45,103 --> 00:44:46,938
Lord, I don't know why
I is getting such cross.

468
00:44:47,063 --> 00:44:49,858
I can't kill rabbits, Dell.

469
00:44:50,110 --> 00:44:53,364
Because they've got big eyes.
And they're watching me.

470
00:44:53,530 --> 00:44:56,909
- Why can't you kill them?
- Because I can't.

471
00:44:57,159 --> 00:44:59,621
You know I can't. You hear me?

472
00:44:59,914 --> 00:45:04,128
If you do that to rabbits I feel bad.
I don't do that.

473
00:45:04,336 --> 00:45:09,050
Well, I put food in my tummy already.
Am I a maid? Am I a wife?

474
00:45:09,219 --> 00:45:13,224
Do I make the sky turn blue?
Dickens, feed yourself, you're no child.

475
00:45:13,516 --> 00:45:16,059
But my tummy is empty, Dell!

476
00:45:16,769 --> 00:45:19,021
You didn't even leave me a crumb.

477
00:45:19,356 --> 00:45:25,532
You tummy will get his food, Dickens,
but not for lunch. No lunch.

478
00:45:25,782 --> 00:45:27,909
I'll fill him at dinner,
he'll get his rabbit then.

479
00:45:28,494 --> 00:45:30,954
Mama needs reading to
before I kill for you.

480
00:45:32,375 --> 00:45:33,251
Boy!

481
00:45:58,869 --> 00:46:00,788
She's gonna kill you, rabbit.

482
00:46:01,164 --> 00:46:04,626
Better hide. Gonna eat you for dinner.

483
00:46:06,213 --> 00:46:10,175
Better hide. Gonna eat you for dinner.

484
00:46:13,139 --> 00:46:15,599
It was such a wonderful time.

485
00:46:15,809 --> 00:46:20,440
They invited me into
their little stone house. They really did.

486
00:46:20,981 --> 00:46:25,780
And we danced and played games
and sang songs.

487
00:46:28,242 --> 00:46:29,911
Her name is Dell.

488
00:46:30,121 --> 00:46:32,623
And she had the radio fixed.

489
00:46:32,833 --> 00:46:37,672
And I danced with Dickens.
It was wonderful, Mustique.

490
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:41,594
Well, I wouldn't know, would I?

491
00:46:42,679 --> 00:46:44,681
I wasn't there.

492
00:46:48,728 --> 00:46:50,605
I know, Mustique.

493
00:46:58,617 --> 00:47:00,827
I'm sorry you couldn't come too.

494
00:47:01,079 --> 00:47:02,789
I wanted you to.

495
00:47:03,541 --> 00:47:07,086
- I really did.
- You hypnotized us!

496
00:47:07,463 --> 00:47:09,005
I had to.

497
00:47:10,592 --> 00:47:12,594
So you wouldn't stop me going.

498
00:47:18,186 --> 00:47:19,519
There...

499
00:47:21,856 --> 00:47:24,568
What is that stink?

500
00:47:28,074 --> 00:47:29,826
What died in here?

501
00:47:30,577 --> 00:47:32,496
You quit cutting muffins!

502
00:47:32,871 --> 00:47:37,001
Poo in the yard,
because that's where you do it!

503
00:47:44,679 --> 00:47:46,139
What are you eating?

504
00:47:46,599 --> 00:47:48,141
You're fat.

505
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:50,311
Your belly is poking.

506
00:48:04,791 --> 00:48:06,793
You're a real stinker.

507
00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:10,715
And don't say it's me, because it's you.

508
00:48:10,965 --> 00:48:12,384
And you know it!

509
00:48:26,068 --> 00:48:28,822
You don't have to eat
if you don't want to, daddy.

510
00:48:30,617 --> 00:48:33,286
Maybe I'll bring back some food
from Dell.

511
00:48:34,623 --> 00:48:36,208
A butter tart...

512
00:48:36,708 --> 00:48:38,793
or maybe a little piece of her chicken.

513
00:48:40,965 --> 00:48:43,927
Go away, bog man. Leave me alone!

514
00:48:44,927 --> 00:48:46,972
Go away, bog man!

515
00:48:50,561 --> 00:48:52,563
No, no, don't be mad.
I'm wrong again. I'm sorry.

516
00:48:52,813 --> 00:48:57,277
The old lady isn't here any more.
I know that. I'm going now.

517
00:48:57,862 --> 00:48:59,114
She isn't here any more.

518
00:49:00,909 --> 00:49:02,327
Wait! Dickens!

519
00:49:02,619 --> 00:49:05,539
Dickens! Don't be scared.

520
00:49:05,831 --> 00:49:10,003
Dell is my friend. We ate a picnic too!

521
00:49:10,630 --> 00:49:14,844
Come back! I'm Dell's best friend!

522
00:49:17,722 --> 00:49:19,099
Dickens?

523
00:49:25,525 --> 00:49:26,902
Come out.

524
00:49:32,326 --> 00:49:34,994
I can see you.

525
00:49:35,539 --> 00:49:39,668
If I run too fast... I faint like a girl.

526
00:49:39,878 --> 00:49:43,173
I'm a girl. I don't faint like a girl.

527
00:49:49,724 --> 00:49:51,853
I'm Jeliza-Rose.

528
00:49:53,105 --> 00:49:57,068
My daddy wrote a song about me
because I'm special.

529
00:50:12,630 --> 00:50:14,507
How come you know my name?

530
00:50:14,842 --> 00:50:18,639
Dell told me. She's my best friend.

531
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:22,476
She's my sister.

532
00:50:25,481 --> 00:50:27,525
Who was that in the chair?

533
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:29,652
Was that your mama?

534
00:50:30,739 --> 00:50:32,282
My daddy.

535
00:50:35,536 --> 00:50:39,918
He's pretty too... with pretty hair.

536
00:50:40,501 --> 00:50:42,463
I made him pretty.

537
00:50:45,009 --> 00:50:47,302
The old lady lived there.

538
00:50:48,512 --> 00:50:52,476
See, the door was open,
so, she could have been there too.

539
00:50:52,851 --> 00:50:55,773
But she wasn't, but maybe she was.

540
00:50:57,233 --> 00:51:00,612
Yeah,
I'm always getting into trouble that way...

541
00:51:01,989 --> 00:51:03,407
when I'm wrong.

542
00:51:05,244 --> 00:51:06,246
Wait.

543
00:51:07,289 --> 00:51:09,083
What happened to your head?

544
00:51:09,916 --> 00:51:14,965
They cut inside my head, they did.
They cut my brain...

545
00:51:15,132 --> 00:51:20,639
so I'm not epileptic no more
only sometimes.

546
00:51:20,889 --> 00:51:22,141
Like this.

547
00:51:34,367 --> 00:51:36,159
Do you have a pool?

548
00:51:36,369 --> 00:51:42,003
No. I can't swim. Because I'll get
a seizure and sink like a stone.

549
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:44,880
I don't swim except in the tub.

550
00:51:45,132 --> 00:51:48,510
- And I don't drive cars.
- Yeah, me either.

551
00:51:48,887 --> 00:51:51,807
See, I can't drive to save my life.
Not even if I'm bloody...

552
00:51:52,016 --> 00:51:54,101
or my arm's chopped off.

553
00:51:54,351 --> 00:51:57,105
If you drive you'll go...

554
00:51:58,608 --> 00:52:02,530
Yeah, yeah, that's what'll happen,
all right.

555
00:52:04,699 --> 00:52:09,039
Uh-oh. Careful, you'll drown
if you don't keep swimming?

556
00:52:10,373 --> 00:52:11,833
Oh, I'm drowning!

557
00:52:12,126 --> 00:52:16,007
I am. Save me! Save me!

558
00:52:16,215 --> 00:52:18,425
I need to go get Lisa.

559
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:20,804
- Lisa? - Yeah, Lisa!

560
00:52:20,972 --> 00:52:26,269
And see, then I don't have to swim
anyway. Lisa's my submarine.

561
00:52:27,856 --> 00:52:31,320
If you wanna see it, I don't know...

562
00:52:31,527 --> 00:52:33,864
Maybe tomorrow you can.

563
00:52:34,114 --> 00:52:38,246
I want to see it. I like submarines.

564
00:52:39,706 --> 00:52:41,166
Thing is...

565
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:46,257
thing is, you gotta hold my hand, okay?

566
00:52:46,590 --> 00:52:48,550
Real tight, okay?

567
00:52:49,802 --> 00:52:51,012
Okay.

568
00:52:52,181 --> 00:52:56,018
Because that way we don't get lost
from each other.

569
00:52:57,230 --> 00:52:59,940
- All right. - Okay.

570
00:53:00,650 --> 00:53:01,735
That way...

571
00:53:07,494 --> 00:53:09,161
it's the ocean!

572
00:53:15,630 --> 00:53:16,922
This it!

573
00:53:19,594 --> 00:53:21,429
She's Lisa!

574
00:53:24,934 --> 00:53:26,184
She's Lisa.

575
00:53:30,817 --> 00:53:34,697
Vessels underwater have girl names.

576
00:53:34,989 --> 00:53:39,494
Boats on top do too. Well, some do.

577
00:53:42,791 --> 00:53:45,336
What's this supposed to be?
A periscope?

578
00:53:45,630 --> 00:53:46,838
Yeah.

579
00:53:50,385 --> 00:53:52,887
Dive! Dive!

580
00:53:56,518 --> 00:53:58,313
What's this junk?

581
00:53:58,730 --> 00:54:02,025
It ain't junk, it's bait!

582
00:54:03,862 --> 00:54:05,530
You see this?

583
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:09,034
Shark attack!

584
00:54:09,661 --> 00:54:13,375
- A shark did this?
- A monster shark.

585
00:54:14,085 --> 00:54:19,090
Because I hunt them all over
the South Pacific in my submarine.

586
00:54:19,384 --> 00:54:21,177
And I set bait.

587
00:54:26,309 --> 00:54:30,481
They're mostly pennies,
but I got a million.

588
00:54:34,112 --> 00:54:37,365
I set the bait like this.

589
00:54:37,824 --> 00:54:41,413
And then the monster shark,
he comes down the tracks...

590
00:54:41,664 --> 00:54:44,125
his jaws are gnashing...

591
00:54:44,458 --> 00:54:47,963
he mashes everything in his way,
that shark.

592
00:54:48,965 --> 00:54:54,054
When I find bigger bait,
I hide in the submarine and wait.

593
00:54:54,306 --> 00:54:57,684
The only way to stop that monster
is to blow him up.

594
00:54:57,936 --> 00:55:01,065
Rocks and spears don't work,
believe me.

595
00:55:01,773 --> 00:55:04,027
I'm lucky I'm alive.

596
00:55:09,909 --> 00:55:13,873
I need to be home. I need to be home.

597
00:55:15,083 --> 00:55:16,878
- Dickens. - You too.

598
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:21,467
- Don't get in my submarine without me.
- I won't.

599
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:23,302
Bye.

600
00:55:23,554 --> 00:55:25,222
Bye, friend.

601
00:55:26,141 --> 00:55:27,559
Don't drown.

602
00:55:29,646 --> 00:55:31,438
Come visit me tomorrow.

603
00:56:12,536 --> 00:56:17,418
We'll sail away... under the seas.

604
00:56:56,530 --> 00:56:58,532
You love, Dickens?

605
00:56:58,782 --> 00:57:00,199
No I don't.

606
00:57:00,409 --> 00:57:04,414
You want to kiss the cut on his head
and hold hands.

607
00:57:04,706 --> 00:57:07,126
But, he's a sissy.

608
00:57:07,376 --> 00:57:10,713
He's a shark hunter.
He has a submarine too.

609
00:57:10,882 --> 00:57:12,717
Except it's a fake.

610
00:57:12,925 --> 00:57:15,887
He's gonna be rich and buy a real one.

611
00:57:16,054 --> 00:57:19,016
He has more pennies than you.

612
00:57:19,726 --> 00:57:23,646
Hey, wait for me.
That monster shark might be about.

613
00:57:23,856 --> 00:57:27,735
Don't worry.
Dickens the sea captain will save us.

614
00:57:28,362 --> 00:57:31,157
He's sailing under the seas now.

615
00:57:31,617 --> 00:57:35,371
He's diving deep to the place
where dreams are made.

616
00:57:35,579 --> 00:57:40,628
"He walks a lonely shore all littered
with dreams and hopes..."

617
00:57:41,545 --> 00:57:45,300
Dickens, my brave sea captain.

618
00:57:57,023 --> 00:57:59,985
Avast ye, you scurvy...

619
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:03,572
I'll have you keelhauled.

620
00:58:03,824 --> 00:58:08,288
I'll have you strung to the yard arm
and sent to Davey Jones's locker!

621
00:58:08,539 --> 00:58:11,041
- Have mercy on my soul!
- Mutiny.

622
00:58:11,251 --> 00:58:15,840
Looks like the pirate took
the captain prisoner.

623
00:58:16,757 --> 00:58:21,806
- Mercy.
- Those who die will be the lucky ones!

624
00:58:25,309 --> 00:58:28,146
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

625
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:32,027
Wait a minute,
he looks more like a farmer.

626
00:58:32,695 --> 00:58:34,905
He's not really a captain...

627
00:58:36,157 --> 00:58:40,163
- or a prisoner or anything.
- Go on in, Dickens.

628
00:58:40,371 --> 00:58:44,793
- Stay in your room till I call you out.
- Okay, Dell, okay.

629
00:58:47,465 --> 00:58:50,050
Afternoon, Miss Munro.

630
00:58:50,634 --> 00:58:52,219
Hello, Patrick.

631
00:58:52,887 --> 00:58:57,809
Is it afternoon?
My, how the day flies, you know.

632
00:58:58,561 --> 00:59:01,063
"My, how the day flies you know."

633
00:59:04,110 --> 00:59:06,862
I do appreciate all you do for me,
Patrick.

634
00:59:07,782 --> 00:59:11,034
You are such a kind young man.

635
00:59:12,204 --> 00:59:16,001
- Well, I always try...
- I know.

636
00:59:16,543 --> 00:59:18,670
I know. Now, Patrick...

637
00:59:19,630 --> 00:59:23,510
these deliveries...
they is all paid for, ain't they?

638
00:59:24,512 --> 00:59:25,721
Sure.

639
00:59:27,389 --> 00:59:28,974
Thank you.

640
00:59:31,353 --> 00:59:32,938
Are you...

641
00:59:33,231 --> 00:59:34,942
are you go...

642
00:59:35,442 --> 00:59:37,068
will you...

643
00:59:38,695 --> 00:59:39,989
I will.

644
00:59:41,324 --> 00:59:44,452
I will... but not here.

645
00:59:45,496 --> 00:59:47,248
Not in the yard...

646
00:59:47,875 --> 00:59:49,751
not by the tomatoes.

647
01:00:35,019 --> 01:00:36,980
It's a zoo room.

648
01:00:37,563 --> 01:00:40,567
It stinks of disinfectant.

649
01:00:53,668 --> 01:00:55,211
Miss Munro.

650
01:00:58,507 --> 01:01:00,217
What are they doing?

651
01:01:00,802 --> 01:01:03,347
She's touching his boy-thing.

652
01:01:03,597 --> 01:01:07,311
It's gone all angry and red!

653
01:01:07,603 --> 01:01:09,855
She's kissing it!

654
01:01:12,192 --> 01:01:14,860
She's sucking his blood!

655
01:01:23,456 --> 01:01:27,253
- He's trying to call for help.
- She's a vampire.

656
01:01:28,922 --> 01:01:30,172
You're next.

657
01:01:32,510 --> 01:01:36,139
Oh, shit. Why'd you stop, Miss Mun...

658
01:01:52,034 --> 01:01:55,289
We're safe. We escaped.

659
01:01:57,376 --> 01:02:00,128
I thought she was gonna be my friend.

660
01:02:02,215 --> 01:02:06,762
Say... isn't that the rabbit hole you found?

661
01:02:09,141 --> 01:02:11,434
It looks bigger than before.

662
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:15,106
Maybe I could crawl in.

663
01:02:16,275 --> 01:02:18,735
I want to look in. Show me.

664
01:02:20,614 --> 01:02:22,615
Okay. All right.

665
01:02:30,460 --> 01:02:32,295
Mustique!

666
01:02:32,545 --> 01:02:35,465
I'm falling very slowly, dear.

667
01:02:35,759 --> 01:02:40,764
The sides of the holes are filled
with cupboards and book-shelves.

668
01:02:41,724 --> 01:02:42,934
Can you hear me?

669
01:02:43,976 --> 01:02:46,730
No, don't listen to her!

670
01:02:47,606 --> 01:02:49,818
She's gone, Jeliza-Rose.

671
01:02:50,068 --> 01:02:56,534
It's too dangerous to rescue Mustique.
You have to face up to it.

672
01:02:57,744 --> 01:03:00,289
Take that! She's not dead yet.

673
01:03:00,916 --> 01:03:03,460
You just wanna take her place.

674
01:03:04,878 --> 01:03:06,338
You're all traitors.

675
01:03:06,882 --> 01:03:11,262
You don't have hearts.
You're just heads!

676
01:03:13,097 --> 01:03:15,307
- And you too!
- No, no.

677
01:03:15,518 --> 01:03:19,856
Jeliza-Rose, please.
I want to help save Mustique.

678
01:03:20,065 --> 01:03:25,112
I truly do. Because of my eyes,
I can sense things in the dark.

679
01:03:26,322 --> 01:03:28,492
You're better than those other two.

680
01:03:29,744 --> 01:03:33,081
I'm sorry Mustique was so mean to you.

681
01:03:39,882 --> 01:03:41,925
I'm almost a ghost.

682
01:03:43,052 --> 01:03:45,847
That's why Dell didn't see me.

683
01:03:47,601 --> 01:03:49,603
I really think I am...

684
01:03:50,353 --> 01:03:51,271
don't you?

685
01:03:51,481 --> 01:03:56,195
I really can't say, Jeliza-Rose.
I don't know about those things.

686
01:04:03,246 --> 01:04:05,164
Come in, Mustique.

687
01:04:06,125 --> 01:04:07,376
Are you there?

688
01:04:08,585 --> 01:04:09,878
Can you hear me?

689
01:04:10,797 --> 01:04:13,217
This is radio Jeliza-Rose.

690
01:04:14,510 --> 01:04:17,764
Am I loud and clear?
Come in, please.

691
01:04:19,016 --> 01:04:20,434
Over.

692
01:04:47,010 --> 01:04:48,429
Dickens?

693
01:04:49,264 --> 01:04:51,056
Thought you was a squirrel.

694
01:04:51,432 --> 01:04:52,768
He's spoiled.

695
01:04:55,396 --> 01:04:57,231
He's cutting muffins, is all.

696
01:04:58,442 --> 01:05:04,282
I guess that's what it is... I guess.
Whatever it is.

697
01:05:04,742 --> 01:05:07,202
Your daddy sleeps a lot.

698
01:05:07,746 --> 01:05:11,208
- My mama does too.
- Is she a ghost?

699
01:05:11,876 --> 01:05:15,170
No, not any more. Not really.

700
01:05:15,422 --> 01:05:17,175
She's just a dozer.

701
01:05:17,717 --> 01:05:20,677
She isn't as pretty as your daddy.

702
01:05:21,012 --> 01:05:24,141
Her hair isn't nice like his is.

703
01:05:24,684 --> 01:05:26,686
It's only fake.

704
01:05:26,853 --> 01:05:27,855
See.

705
01:05:31,443 --> 01:05:34,989
That's funny.
You fooled me because I didn't know.

706
01:05:35,197 --> 01:05:37,365
It's not supposed to be funny.

707
01:05:39,411 --> 01:05:41,539
It was Mustique's idea.

708
01:05:43,125 --> 01:05:46,503
Dickens... will you help me
save my friend?

709
01:05:46,670 --> 01:05:51,510
She may be dying.
She's farther than the ocean, I think.

710
01:05:56,601 --> 01:05:58,561
I probably can't do it.

711
01:05:58,936 --> 01:06:01,105
But you're the captain!

712
01:06:01,315 --> 01:06:05,945
Yeah, I am.
Because I've got my own submarine.

713
01:06:06,739 --> 01:06:10,536
Can we feed the shark?
I'd like to do that.

714
01:06:11,161 --> 01:06:16,000
If you want you can help me too.
We can lure it.

715
01:06:16,333 --> 01:06:18,253
Meaner than death.

716
01:06:18,461 --> 01:06:20,922
Okay, I'll help you.

717
01:06:22,259 --> 01:06:24,427
Then you'll rescue my friend?

718
01:06:26,012 --> 01:06:26,931
Yeah.

719
01:06:29,184 --> 01:06:30,686
What'll happen?

720
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:36,150
The end of the world.

721
01:06:36,818 --> 01:06:38,862
The monster shark will die?

722
01:06:40,907 --> 01:06:43,452
The monster shark never dies.

723
01:06:54,340 --> 01:06:55,592
Bad dog.

724
01:06:56,344 --> 01:06:59,264
You watered all the fish and seaweeds.

725
01:06:59,974 --> 01:07:02,018
Bad dog!

726
01:07:02,226 --> 01:07:05,521
- You're the bad dog.
- No, you're the bad dog.

727
01:07:06,231 --> 01:07:10,528
- You're a bad dog!
- You're a bad dog for looking.

728
01:07:11,405 --> 01:07:13,324
We better go.

729
01:07:13,574 --> 01:07:16,619
If the monster shark catches us here,
we're doomed.

730
01:07:18,039 --> 01:07:19,164
Monster shark!

731
01:07:19,498 --> 01:07:24,172
Monster shark. Gonna kill you.
It's gonna eat you.

732
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:26,840
The bus! We can hide there.

733
01:07:27,425 --> 01:07:31,222
No, that's a bad place.
It's wrong there.

734
01:07:31,472 --> 01:07:33,432
No. Come on!

735
01:07:34,684 --> 01:07:36,186
Can't go there.

736
01:07:37,105 --> 01:07:42,110
You use the bus for shark bait
and it tips over and burns up.

737
01:07:43,155 --> 01:07:44,949
And then you get in trouble.

738
01:07:45,114 --> 01:07:49,246
And Officer Waller said "You can't
drive a bus on the tracks, Dickens...

739
01:07:49,454 --> 01:07:54,168
you should know that.
That'll get you sent away, Dickens."

740
01:07:54,378 --> 01:07:56,880
So I can't go there with you.

741
01:07:58,173 --> 01:08:00,342
I can't go there with you.

742
01:08:01,262 --> 01:08:04,097
Captain, you're acting wei...

743
01:08:04,306 --> 01:08:05,766
- silly - Can't go.

744
01:08:06,559 --> 01:08:10,398
Sometimes you just worry about it
too much.

745
01:08:11,108 --> 01:08:14,945
Just pretend it never happened, okay?

746
01:08:16,989 --> 01:08:19,951
I better go home now and eat, I think.

747
01:08:20,077 --> 01:08:22,621
Maybe we can find some food together.

748
01:08:23,456 --> 01:08:26,333
We shouldn't play no more today.

749
01:08:27,502 --> 01:08:31,757
You have to save my friend.
You said you'd do that.

750
01:08:32,051 --> 01:08:37,432
I don't know, because I make mistakes
if I try some things.

751
01:08:38,182 --> 01:08:40,269
But you have to.

752
01:08:41,939 --> 01:08:44,358
You promised.

753
01:08:45,819 --> 01:08:47,613
What is your friend?

754
01:08:47,820 --> 01:08:48,863
A head.

755
01:08:49,532 --> 01:08:52,368
- A doll's head.
- Does she bite?

756
01:08:52,578 --> 01:08:53,662
No.

757
01:08:54,412 --> 01:08:56,623
Her mouth is like this.

758
01:09:00,755 --> 01:09:02,715
She doesn't have teeth.

759
01:09:02,925 --> 01:09:06,177
All right. Okay.

760
01:09:14,730 --> 01:09:19,319
Wait! I got her. It has to be her.

761
01:09:19,528 --> 01:09:22,657
- It has to be.
- Yeah, it has to be!

762
01:09:28,373 --> 01:09:30,251
No, it's weird.

763
01:09:31,836 --> 01:09:35,507
It's not a head at all,
it's not like what you said.

764
01:09:36,007 --> 01:09:38,970
And that's all that's down there, okay?

765
01:09:39,179 --> 01:09:42,224
There's nothing but dirt and more dirt.

766
01:09:42,641 --> 01:09:44,143
She's dead.

767
01:09:49,734 --> 01:09:52,362
I can feel something coming.

768
01:09:53,738 --> 01:09:58,036
It's the monster shark!
He's coming for the bait!

769
01:09:59,997 --> 01:10:03,251
- Look out!
- Wait! Where are you going?

770
01:10:05,380 --> 01:10:07,673
Dickens! Dickens!

771
01:10:08,466 --> 01:10:09,844
Dickens!

772
01:10:10,427 --> 01:10:13,096
Damn you. Trouble-maker!

773
01:10:13,347 --> 01:10:15,434
Vandal!

774
01:10:28,951 --> 01:10:32,788
Hold on, Jeliza-Rose. We're coming.

775
01:10:33,041 --> 01:10:34,167
Come on, hurry up.

776
01:10:36,002 --> 01:10:37,962
Is she dead?

777
01:10:39,923 --> 01:10:42,010
I can't be sure.

778
01:10:42,344 --> 01:10:45,262
Look, she's breathing.

779
01:10:46,222 --> 01:10:52,064
She's weak. And must be pretty hungry,
pretty thirsty too.

780
01:10:52,606 --> 01:10:54,859
What's that?

781
01:10:56,654 --> 01:10:59,364
Smells like disinfectant.

782
01:11:00,074 --> 01:11:04,204
- Look, I try to be good, okay.
- Dickens...

783
01:11:04,538 --> 01:11:07,751
And I'll get the boy.

784
01:11:09,796 --> 01:11:12,131
Where are you going, Jeliza-Rose?

785
01:11:12,341 --> 01:11:16,011
Don't go downstairs. Dell's there.

786
01:11:16,179 --> 01:11:18,640
Don't go, Jeliza-Rose.

787
01:11:19,182 --> 01:11:22,435
I wish Mustique were here.

788
01:11:22,688 --> 01:11:25,690
Don't cry. Mustique's gone forever.

789
01:11:25,942 --> 01:11:29,445
Don't go downstairs. I'm afraid.

790
01:11:29,697 --> 01:11:33,117
- You're always crying.
- Baby.

791
01:11:33,827 --> 01:11:36,037
- I'm not a baby.
- You act like one.

792
01:11:36,497 --> 01:11:37,832
Cry baby.

793
01:11:38,082 --> 01:11:43,462
Cry, cry baby, cry baby.

794
01:11:45,007 --> 01:11:47,426
Maybe you two want to come with me?

795
01:11:49,139 --> 01:11:51,099
Well, you're coming anyhow.

796
01:11:52,475 --> 01:11:55,688
Please don't go, Jeliza-Rose.

797
01:11:56,605 --> 01:11:59,650
What is that terrible smell?

798
01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:01,904
I told you...

799
01:12:02,404 --> 01:12:04,364
disinfectant.

800
01:12:07,787 --> 01:12:10,832
What can she be doing down there?

801
01:12:12,417 --> 01:12:13,836
I don't know.

802
01:12:15,463 --> 01:12:16,756
We'll find out.

803
01:12:32,444 --> 01:12:35,279
To meet again like this...

804
01:12:35,739 --> 01:12:39,578
I won't let you go though. Not again.

805
01:12:42,539 --> 01:12:44,583
No more running away.

806
01:12:48,465 --> 01:12:51,009
I love you so much.

807
01:12:58,395 --> 01:13:00,854
There's so much damage done already.

808
01:13:01,021 --> 01:13:03,483
But I'll save what's left. Oh, I will.

809
01:13:03,900 --> 01:13:05,403
Put this there.

810
01:13:08,198 --> 01:13:11,703
- Who welcomed you down here, child?
- Not me, Dell, I didn't!

811
01:13:13,706 --> 01:13:14,747
Not me.

812
01:13:17,042 --> 01:13:19,337
Wigs and blush, they won't cut it, child.

813
01:13:19,546 --> 01:13:22,632
You can stay and watch if you must,
but you be quiet or else.

814
01:13:28,099 --> 01:13:29,809
Now I want to chill him.

815
01:13:30,644 --> 01:13:32,395
What a mess.

816
01:13:36,609 --> 01:13:39,654
This isn't fun. This is a sad man.

817
01:13:39,864 --> 01:13:42,408
This a sad, sad man.

818
01:13:42,993 --> 01:13:43,953
Now...

819
01:13:50,252 --> 01:13:52,171
Sinister apples.

820
01:13:52,463 --> 01:13:55,132
Sinister, sinister apples.

821
01:13:58,305 --> 01:13:59,805
I'm tired, I'm tired, tired, tired.

822
01:14:00,015 --> 01:14:02,600
See the skin has to be peeled.

823
01:14:02,810 --> 01:14:04,395
And then the fat trimmed...

824
01:14:04,645 --> 01:14:07,983
and the bones, they get sprinkled
with powdered Borax...

825
01:14:08,234 --> 01:14:11,404
then the shaping of the wire begins...

826
01:14:11,654 --> 01:14:14,617
and the mending,
the sewing, the varnishing...

827
01:14:21,585 --> 01:14:22,627
Rose.

828
01:14:23,878 --> 01:14:25,171
Rose.

829
01:14:27,257 --> 01:14:29,094
Arise, Rose...

830
01:14:29,679 --> 01:14:31,596
and behold Noah.

831
01:14:34,016 --> 01:14:38,146
- Is he all better now?
- Course he's better, course he is.

832
01:14:39,608 --> 01:14:41,359
Are you gonna give him something?

833
01:14:42,319 --> 01:14:44,698
A gift for his new life.

834
01:14:45,740 --> 01:14:47,868
- Like what?
- Oh, I don't know.

835
01:14:48,118 --> 01:14:51,538
You have to choose. It has to be
something dear to you, though.

836
01:14:56,255 --> 01:14:59,591
- No, not me!
- No, not me.

837
01:14:59,842 --> 01:15:02,845
- No, don't. Oh, please. Please!
- Don't, Jeliza-Rose... I'm scared.

838
01:15:03,180 --> 01:15:08,145
Not me! Jeliza-Rose, I'm your friend.

839
01:15:08,436 --> 01:15:09,854
Jeliza-Rose!

840
01:15:10,148 --> 01:15:11,524
- Goodbye. - No.

841
01:15:13,484 --> 01:15:15,194
Have a nice trip.

842
01:15:16,989 --> 01:15:20,076
Jeliza-Rose, get me out.

843
01:15:20,411 --> 01:15:26,126
- We're so afraid!
- Somebody save me. Help!

844
01:15:26,711 --> 01:15:29,296
Can anyone hear me? Help!

845
01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:33,761
You brought Noah back to me.

846
01:15:35,305 --> 01:15:37,474
So we'll share him now.

847
01:15:40,686 --> 01:15:42,271
But you're his.

848
01:15:43,356 --> 01:15:44,983
You understand, child?

849
01:15:56,207 --> 01:15:58,876
Go to the porch, draw in,
it's the fumes.

850
01:15:59,877 --> 01:16:01,796
It's unhealthy for your lungs.

851
01:16:02,798 --> 01:16:04,132
Go on, get!

852
01:16:25,202 --> 01:16:26,953
It's a new day.

853
01:16:29,082 --> 01:16:30,835
We'll get your house in order.

854
01:16:31,085 --> 01:16:33,462
An untidy home means an untidy person.

855
01:16:36,426 --> 01:16:38,886
Monster! You nasty thing!

856
01:16:41,806 --> 01:16:43,015
Nasty thing.

857
01:16:44,894 --> 01:16:47,855
Come on, things to do.
Come on. Up. Up!

858
01:16:50,234 --> 01:16:51,235
Dickens.

859
01:16:53,823 --> 01:16:56,033
- Gotta clean, clean, clean.
- Clean, clean, clean.

860
01:16:59,621 --> 01:17:01,707
Wash me in the blood of Jesus

861
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:05,546
And clean the tarnished soul

862
01:17:06,588 --> 01:17:10,009
He will heal me
Make me whole

863
01:17:10,217 --> 01:17:11,219
Wipe it!

864
01:17:14,975 --> 01:17:16,685
Rise and shine

865
01:17:16,935 --> 01:17:20,648
Rise and shine

866
01:17:20,899 --> 01:17:26,155
We'll rise and shine with Jesus
In my new home in the sky

867
01:17:26,323 --> 01:17:29,033
With loaves and fish He'll feed us

868
01:17:29,284 --> 01:17:31,746
His pierced hands will lead us

869
01:17:31,997 --> 01:17:37,420
And we'll rise and shine with Jesus
in the sky

870
01:17:37,670 --> 01:17:40,172
Now when we get to heaven

871
01:17:40,466 --> 01:17:43,135
That sin'll be all compared

872
01:17:43,345 --> 01:17:48,393
And angel's wings we're given
as we climb them golden stairs

873
01:17:48,601 --> 01:17:51,979
I'm gonna strip off
and put on a pure white robe

874
01:17:52,231 --> 01:17:54,484
Scrub clean my sinful soul

875
01:17:54,692 --> 01:17:57,362
So wash me in the blood

876
01:17:57,613 --> 01:18:03,953
Wash me in the blood of Jesus

877
01:18:05,497 --> 01:18:06,541
Now...

878
01:18:08,252 --> 01:18:11,296
seal your eyes and mouth,
extend your arms and hold your breath.

879
01:18:14,844 --> 01:18:16,886
Do your panties.

880
01:18:19,099 --> 01:18:22,936
Beer braised rabbit with carrots
and onions and potatoes.

881
01:18:23,229 --> 01:18:26,442
A jar of lemonade and butter tarts
for dessert.

882
01:18:27,025 --> 01:18:30,404
Fruits of Eden all for the children of Noah.

883
01:18:34,453 --> 01:18:35,953
Jeliza-Rose...

884
01:18:36,162 --> 01:18:37,747
this is where you belong...

885
01:18:38,666 --> 01:18:42,128
Jeliza... this is where you belong.
You're part...

886
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:45,882
you're part of the family now,
you hear me?

887
01:18:46,134 --> 01:18:48,677
We cannot have any strangers here.

888
01:18:48,845 --> 01:18:51,390
They'd take daddy away from us.
Do you hear me?

889
01:18:56,021 --> 01:18:57,481
Dear Lord...

890
01:18:59,067 --> 01:19:03,030
I hold up a hand to Death.
I keep that troublesome stranger away.

891
01:19:03,363 --> 01:19:05,115
- That is my calling. - Hallelujah.

892
01:19:05,326 --> 01:19:08,703
When you love something,
it doesn't have to die or go in the ground.

893
01:19:08,913 --> 01:19:13,752
Nothing has to change, for I am
the keeper of the silent souls. Amen.

894
01:19:14,002 --> 01:19:15,421
Amen.

895
01:19:16,006 --> 01:19:19,511
Now, eat. Stuff yourselves.

896
01:19:19,802 --> 01:19:20,970
Yeah.

897
01:19:25,810 --> 01:19:27,020
He's good.

898
01:19:28,521 --> 01:19:30,606
I waited for you for so long.

899
01:19:31,109 --> 01:19:32,443
And now...

900
01:19:32,903 --> 01:19:35,697
after all these years, to have you here...

901
01:19:36,323 --> 01:19:37,699
I love gravy.

902
01:19:37,992 --> 01:19:40,828
- You won't be leaving me again.
- Lemonade.

903
01:19:41,663 --> 01:19:44,291
You'll be staying put for a long while.

904
01:19:50,007 --> 01:19:52,301
He looks like a burrito.

905
01:19:52,719 --> 01:19:54,387
Sleep of the just.

906
01:19:57,309 --> 01:20:01,730
Did you ever know the old lady?
Rose, you ever know your grandma?

907
01:20:02,356 --> 01:20:05,318
She died when I wasn't even born yet.

908
01:20:06,613 --> 01:20:11,161
You missed a saint.
I owe her my life.

909
01:20:11,411 --> 01:20:14,873
She tended my sorry body
after that bee darn near killed me.

910
01:20:17,293 --> 01:20:20,212
Nasty, nasty bees.

911
01:20:21,256 --> 01:20:24,845
Nasty...

912
01:20:25,136 --> 01:20:27,597
buzzy bees.

913
01:20:28,307 --> 01:20:29,600
Course I...

914
01:20:29,893 --> 01:20:33,730
I can see more than most,
even with my eyes closed.

915
01:20:33,898 --> 01:20:34,899
Yes.

916
01:20:35,233 --> 01:20:37,735
I can see birds and...

917
01:20:38,029 --> 01:20:40,698
rabbits and...

918
01:20:43,202 --> 01:20:46,956
curious little girls hiding behind bushes.

919
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:54,548
I can see everything you can imagine.

920
01:20:57,345 --> 01:20:58,762
Course...

921
01:20:59,806 --> 01:21:03,185
curious little girls hiding behind bushes...

922
01:21:03,435 --> 01:21:06,021
sometimes see more than they should.

923
01:21:07,524 --> 01:21:10,277
Best minding one's own business,
you hear me?

924
01:21:11,320 --> 01:21:14,032
Otherwise, Rose,
bad things might happen.

925
01:21:14,492 --> 01:21:17,828
Bad, bad things might happen
under the sun.

926
01:21:23,462 --> 01:21:26,715
You smell awful.
You reek of the devil, Rose!

927
01:21:34,768 --> 01:21:35,810
You're dead.

928
01:21:37,980 --> 01:21:40,315
You finished making that trap, Dickens?

929
01:21:40,984 --> 01:21:41,985
Dickens!

930
01:21:45,782 --> 01:21:46,824
Nasty.

931
01:21:47,493 --> 01:21:48,578
Diseased.

932
01:22:00,886 --> 01:22:02,761
Come on, hurry up now, Dickens.

933
01:22:04,181 --> 01:22:05,224
Nasty.

934
01:22:50,698 --> 01:22:52,534
Sateen Lips?

935
01:22:54,037 --> 01:22:55,663
Baby Blonde?

936
01:22:59,210 --> 01:23:02,171
- Are you there?
- Yeah, hallelujah.

937
01:23:03,550 --> 01:23:08,889
Behold brothers and sisters,
she's been washed in the blood of Jesus.

938
01:23:09,097 --> 01:23:11,516
A full recovery is expected.

939
01:23:11,851 --> 01:23:15,981
I've never been so happy.
I'm alive!

940
01:23:16,690 --> 01:23:20,069
Jeliza-Rose, you know I love you,
don't you?

941
01:23:20,904 --> 01:23:22,657
Honey, I'm sorry.

942
01:23:22,865 --> 01:23:24,658
I'll do something nice for you soon.

943
01:23:24,868 --> 01:23:26,953
- I promise, baby.
- Hallelujah. She's born again.

944
01:23:27,663 --> 01:23:32,461
- Jesus is giving her a new brain.
- Have some chocolate.

945
01:23:32,670 --> 01:23:35,797
Wash me in the blood

946
01:23:36,048 --> 01:23:38,301
Rise and shine, dear.

947
01:23:42,850 --> 01:23:44,768
Mustique's alive!

948
01:23:45,145 --> 01:23:47,980
She's okay and happy.

949
01:23:48,274 --> 01:23:50,318
Just a dream. Trust me.

950
01:23:50,568 --> 01:23:53,695
- I know everything.
- Stop it.

951
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:56,617
Stop pretending you're her.

952
01:23:56,909 --> 01:23:59,912
I have no idea what you're talking about.

953
01:24:00,122 --> 01:24:02,750
It's not just a dream!

954
01:24:07,506 --> 01:24:11,595
That's what you get! You're a bad dog!

955
01:24:25,654 --> 01:24:27,698
Hi, Jeliza-Rose.

956
01:24:27,990 --> 01:24:32,412
I better go because I didn't knock
and that's rude. So I'll go, okay?

957
01:24:33,916 --> 01:24:36,460
I didn't knock, so I'll go, okay?

958
01:24:36,670 --> 01:24:39,381
Don't go! Don't go.

959
01:24:39,631 --> 01:24:43,386
I've got good news.
Mustique's all right!

960
01:24:43,636 --> 01:24:46,472
She's in the hospital
but she's got a body...

961
01:24:46,724 --> 01:24:49,601
and she's gonna get a real brain too!

962
01:24:49,810 --> 01:24:52,771
I'd like a new brain sometimes.

963
01:24:53,023 --> 01:24:56,359
Because I think a new one is shiny!

964
01:24:56,610 --> 01:24:59,530
Yeah. She was happy.

965
01:24:59,782 --> 01:25:02,409
I guess she isn't a doll any more.

966
01:25:02,786 --> 01:25:04,496
She must be pretty.

967
01:25:06,207 --> 01:25:08,292
She's beautiful.

968
01:25:09,420 --> 01:25:12,672
She's fabulous, dear.

969
01:25:15,511 --> 01:25:19,932
And we're gonna make you fabulous
too, darling.

970
01:25:27,234 --> 01:25:28,444
That one.

971
01:25:30,029 --> 01:25:32,657
Scarlet Surrender is best.

972
01:25:33,408 --> 01:25:35,869
Now, sit still...

973
01:25:36,747 --> 01:25:40,918
- or you'll make me do it wrong.
- I won't move a muscle.

974
01:25:41,127 --> 01:25:44,881
As I don't have muscles anyway,
so I won't move them.

975
01:25:46,926 --> 01:25:48,386
Puff your lips.

976
01:25:49,805 --> 01:25:51,181
Get ready.

977
01:26:11,707 --> 01:26:12,876
There.

978
01:26:17,966 --> 01:26:19,885
I think you're nice.

979
01:26:27,395 --> 01:26:28,814
It's silly.

980
01:26:30,567 --> 01:26:32,609
You got red on me.

981
01:26:33,027 --> 01:26:34,820
Silly kisser.

982
01:26:37,533 --> 01:26:41,413
The old lady who lived here
was a silly kisser too.

983
01:26:42,247 --> 01:26:43,832
She kissed me.

984
01:26:44,626 --> 01:26:46,670
That was when I was little.

985
01:26:46,878 --> 01:26:48,755
She was my grandma.

986
01:26:50,216 --> 01:26:52,135
She never kissed me...

987
01:26:53,887 --> 01:26:56,180
because I didn't get born yet.

988
01:26:56,432 --> 01:27:00,186
Sometimes she did this in my mouth...

989
01:27:02,649 --> 01:27:04,693
and that was fun.

990
01:27:05,319 --> 01:27:08,197
It was a snake, I think...

991
01:27:08,532 --> 01:27:11,452
or a goldfish dancing.

992
01:27:12,037 --> 01:27:15,832
Some days I'd be here all day
kissing with her.

993
01:27:16,082 --> 01:27:20,296
She's a nice lady. Except she's dead.

994
01:27:21,297 --> 01:27:22,757
Dickens...

995
01:27:26,137 --> 01:27:28,474
she was your girlfriend.

996
01:27:29,184 --> 01:27:31,770
You were her boyfriend.

997
01:27:36,568 --> 01:27:39,529
No...

998
01:27:39,780 --> 01:27:43,743
I was her cutie... I was her little cutie.

999
01:27:44,453 --> 01:27:46,537
But she...

1000
01:27:48,082 --> 01:27:51,002
she did fall down the steps and die.

1001
01:27:52,380 --> 01:27:55,591
I ran down when she did that.

1002
01:27:55,967 --> 01:28:00,265
Because I was just little,
I didn't know what to do.

1003
01:28:01,140 --> 01:28:03,560
I was scared.

1004
01:28:05,896 --> 01:28:09,902
- She's nice lady. - Dickens...

1005
01:28:15,577 --> 01:28:17,537
you're a little cutie.

1006
01:28:24,588 --> 01:28:26,881
You're a little cutie too.

1007
01:28:32,724 --> 01:28:34,434
Silly kissers!

1008
01:28:34,976 --> 01:28:36,686
Silly kissers!

1009
01:28:37,895 --> 01:28:38,814
Silly...

1010
01:28:41,985 --> 01:28:42,987
A bomb!

1011
01:28:44,697 --> 01:28:47,033
They're exploding the ground!

1012
01:28:47,993 --> 01:28:51,287
It's bigger than firecrackers
and bullets.

1013
01:28:51,497 --> 01:28:56,420
- I love firecrackers.
- Me too. I really do.

1014
01:29:20,493 --> 01:29:22,828
It's the boom hole!

1015
01:29:22,996 --> 01:29:24,914
It's the edge of the world.

1016
01:29:25,123 --> 01:29:27,292
It's the Hundred Year Ocean.

1017
01:29:36,639 --> 01:29:38,431
I got a secret.

1018
01:29:39,850 --> 01:29:42,895
If I say, you can't tell, okay?

1019
01:29:43,898 --> 01:29:49,113
Because if Dell knows she'll wallop me
good and I'll be in trouble forever.

1020
01:29:49,322 --> 01:29:50,489
What is it?

1021
01:29:53,202 --> 01:29:55,746
It's a giant atom bomb.

1022
01:29:56,456 --> 01:29:58,958
And the end of the whole world.

1023
01:29:59,127 --> 01:30:03,298
Yeah, like a big tidal wave
that goes whoosh!

1024
01:30:03,756 --> 01:30:07,220
And everything gets cleaned away
like chemicals...

1025
01:30:07,470 --> 01:30:11,141
and the Baby Jesus returns
forever and ever.

1026
01:30:11,434 --> 01:30:12,893
Amen.

1027
01:30:13,770 --> 01:30:14,979
I wanna see.

1028
01:30:16,149 --> 01:30:21,238
I don't know. Maybe tomorrow
when Dell drives to town.

1029
01:30:22,740 --> 01:30:24,451
If you show me...

1030
01:30:26,287 --> 01:30:28,204
you can keep the arm.

1031
01:30:29,123 --> 01:30:33,671
Is it a boy or a girl?
Because a girl is nice, I think.

1032
01:30:33,921 --> 01:30:37,007
- It's a boy.
- How can you tell?

1033
01:30:45,060 --> 01:30:50,359
- No, that doesn't mean it's a boy.
- Yes, it does.

1034
01:30:51,485 --> 01:30:52,904
It's a thingy.

1035
01:30:53,279 --> 01:30:55,823
You got a thingy. I know.

1036
01:30:56,074 --> 01:30:58,953
No, that's wrong. I don't have that.

1037
01:31:00,037 --> 01:31:01,789
I don't have that.

1038
01:31:02,667 --> 01:31:04,001
Dickens.

1039
01:31:06,755 --> 01:31:08,340
Dickens...

1040
01:31:10,301 --> 01:31:12,720
I'd like to see your secret.

1041
01:31:13,680 --> 01:31:15,056
I don't know.

1042
01:31:19,980 --> 01:31:21,940
You're my boyfriend.

1043
01:31:23,109 --> 01:31:24,610
My cutie.

1044
01:31:26,948 --> 01:31:29,617
You're my dear sweet Captain...

1045
01:31:31,161 --> 01:31:33,247
and I'm Mrs Captain.

1046
01:31:34,457 --> 01:31:36,626
I don't understand that.

1047
01:31:38,796 --> 01:31:41,132
I better go home, I think.

1048
01:32:10,087 --> 01:32:15,217
Dickens has a girlfriend.
He's your boyfriend.

1049
01:32:15,469 --> 01:32:17,470
He's my husband.

1050
01:32:17,764 --> 01:32:21,518
And I... I... I...

1051
01:32:21,851 --> 01:32:23,103
I'm his wife.

1052
01:32:23,354 --> 01:32:27,068
He's dreamboat. He's a sunny cloud.

1053
01:32:27,443 --> 01:32:28,569
Kiss me.

1054
01:32:29,235 --> 01:32:32,823
- You're a girl.
- Kiss me and I'll be a boy.

1055
01:32:33,449 --> 01:32:38,664
- Girls don't kiss girls that way.
- Please.

1056
01:32:44,923 --> 01:32:46,884
Oh baby.

1057
01:32:53,016 --> 01:32:54,978
You're disgusting.

1058
01:32:55,186 --> 01:32:58,606
That was fun. That was great.

1059
01:32:58,817 --> 01:33:02,488
- You're my best friend.
- And you're mine too.

1060
01:33:02,697 --> 01:33:04,907
And I love Dickens!

1061
01:33:05,367 --> 01:33:10,163
He's the sweet prince.
He's the great king.

1062
01:33:11,039 --> 01:33:13,542
He's apply juice and jerky!

1063
01:33:13,836 --> 01:33:15,796
We're a happy family.

1064
01:33:16,006 --> 01:33:19,676
And Dell will marry daddy
and look after us all.

1065
01:33:20,176 --> 01:33:25,307
And we'll explore the Hundred
Years Ocean. It's a dream come true.

1066
01:33:25,518 --> 01:33:27,603
It's Christmas!

1067
01:33:43,123 --> 01:33:45,335
And what do we have here?

1068
01:33:47,171 --> 01:33:50,215
I think a baby is in me from kissing.

1069
01:33:50,632 --> 01:33:55,430
I think it's Mustique.
I think she's come back.

1070
01:33:56,056 --> 01:33:58,809
Tell Dickens.
Tell him about the baby.

1071
01:33:59,019 --> 01:34:03,440
Then he'll let you see his special secret.
Maybe he's alone.

1072
01:34:05,234 --> 01:34:07,363
But maybe Dell's still there.

1073
01:34:10,533 --> 01:34:11,702
Let's go.

1074
01:34:11,952 --> 01:34:15,623
Let's go see Dickens special secret
in his room.

1075
01:34:21,590 --> 01:34:24,801
My sweet honey rose

1076
01:34:25,011 --> 01:34:28,890
Strange dark flower rose

1077
01:34:29,015 --> 01:34:30,225
Jeliza-Rose

1078
01:34:47,664 --> 01:34:50,292
Hello? It's us.

1079
01:34:52,003 --> 01:34:53,965
It's Jeliza-Rose.

1080
01:34:58,052 --> 01:35:00,514
It's a real nice day for a tea party.

1081
01:35:00,974 --> 01:35:05,813
Me and Glitter Gal are here...
in case you're not too busy.

1082
01:35:43,487 --> 01:35:46,739
Jeliza-Rose. See what happens when
you're small and hungry all the time?

1083
01:35:46,990 --> 01:35:50,369
You're nasty. You deserve it.

1084
01:35:50,579 --> 01:35:53,082
Maybe I am nasty,
but at least I'm alive.

1085
01:35:53,332 --> 01:35:56,086
Get out while you can,
or she'll close a trap on you too!

1086
01:35:56,587 --> 01:36:00,841
Shut up. Shut up!

1087
01:36:02,386 --> 01:36:06,641
It's not fair! I didn't know
you were there. You scared me good!

1088
01:36:06,850 --> 01:36:09,310
No, no, it was an accident.

1089
01:36:09,645 --> 01:36:12,649
You just got spooked, that's all.

1090
01:36:12,858 --> 01:36:16,194
- It was all them ugly dead things and all.
- No, that's not right.

1091
01:36:16,488 --> 01:36:17,948
No, that's not right.

1092
01:36:18,198 --> 01:36:21,953
Because Dell makes them alive again
and that's what she does!

1093
01:36:22,162 --> 01:36:25,708
And she's Jesus how she makes
them alive again!

1094
01:36:27,001 --> 01:36:29,462
You scared me good,
I didn't know you was there!

1095
01:36:29,713 --> 01:36:31,172
I think I fainted.

1096
01:36:31,756 --> 01:36:33,091
I'm sorry.

1097
01:36:33,301 --> 01:36:36,220
Don't do that again or I'll die, okay?

1098
01:36:36,722 --> 01:36:37,849
Okay.

1099
01:36:38,975 --> 01:36:41,310
All right. I'm sorry.

1100
01:36:42,395 --> 01:36:45,524
I think I'm sorry too. Think so.

1101
01:36:50,448 --> 01:36:51,824
Dickens...

1102
01:36:53,911 --> 01:36:56,788
Glitter Gal wants to tell you something.

1103
01:37:05,634 --> 01:37:08,511
That baby sounds like a strange thing.

1104
01:37:08,721 --> 01:37:13,101
We can build a castle...
and Dell will marry my daddy.

1105
01:37:14,063 --> 01:37:15,314
But...

1106
01:37:15,814 --> 01:37:19,860
you have to show me
your special secret first.

1107
01:37:23,615 --> 01:37:26,034
No, I can't build a castle.
I don't know how.

1108
01:37:26,243 --> 01:37:29,122
I don't know how. No.

1109
01:37:31,251 --> 01:37:35,297
Dickens... if you show me your secret...

1110
01:37:36,256 --> 01:37:38,301
I'll love you forever.

1111
01:37:46,311 --> 01:37:51,109
I'll show you, okay? Just once only.

1112
01:37:52,278 --> 01:37:56,742
But if I don't unpack this bag before
Dell gets back, I won't eat tonight.

1113
01:37:56,992 --> 01:37:59,869
So you wait, okay? You wait.

1114
01:38:00,122 --> 01:38:03,041
Don't touch nothing.
This is Dell's place.

1115
01:38:03,208 --> 01:38:04,335
All right.

1116
01:38:05,293 --> 01:38:07,421
I'll wait for my cutie.

1117
01:38:08,465 --> 01:38:10,134
You're my kisser.

1118
01:38:15,390 --> 01:38:18,560
What do you wanna see his special
secret for? You're better off not knowing.

1119
01:38:18,728 --> 01:38:20,980
Look what happens. I was curious.

1120
01:38:22,233 --> 01:38:23,859
You know what Dell's gonna do to me?

1121
01:38:24,027 --> 01:38:25,362
We have to help him.

1122
01:38:26,780 --> 01:38:30,953
You do it. I don't wanna get in trouble.

1123
01:38:33,164 --> 01:38:35,625
That's it, that's it. I'm free, I'm free!

1124
01:38:55,318 --> 01:38:58,780
We can't wake mama,
so we can't talk like this...

1125
01:38:59,030 --> 01:39:01,283
unless we talk like this first.

1126
01:39:03,953 --> 01:39:05,662
Because we're ghosts.

1127
01:39:07,500 --> 01:39:11,046
- We're quiet ghosts.
- Nice.

1128
01:39:13,507 --> 01:39:16,301
Your house is the witch's cave.

1129
01:39:17,136 --> 01:39:21,059
We're disappearing
and we won't get caught.

1130
01:39:21,266 --> 01:39:23,770
Yeah, that's a good idea, I think.

1131
01:39:24,020 --> 01:39:26,774
Because Dell will wallop me
for having company.

1132
01:39:46,050 --> 01:39:48,136
It's Halloween.

1133
01:40:03,530 --> 01:40:06,742
My room! My room, my room.

1134
01:40:08,828 --> 01:40:13,626
You better get on the bed so you don't
crush nothing important, okay?

1135
01:40:13,836 --> 01:40:14,795
Okay.

1136
01:40:35,154 --> 01:40:37,114
- Is there candy in it?
- No.

1137
01:40:38,826 --> 01:40:41,162
It's my special secret.

1138
01:40:41,829 --> 01:40:45,793
It's the eight wonder.
The great wave.

1139
01:40:47,628 --> 01:40:49,546
The end of the world!

1140
01:40:49,798 --> 01:40:51,050
Dynamite.

1141
01:40:52,385 --> 01:40:55,847
- How do you explode them?
- Like a firecracker, I think.

1142
01:40:56,056 --> 01:41:00,436
Like a war bomb! Boom! Kaboom!

1143
01:41:00,686 --> 01:41:03,189
And everything gets cleaned away.

1144
01:41:03,608 --> 01:41:07,445
The end of the world. Blown to bits.

1145
01:41:08,197 --> 01:41:09,989
So I'll keep them.

1146
01:41:11,158 --> 01:41:13,912
Yeah, I'll keep them until I'm an old man...

1147
01:41:14,663 --> 01:41:19,252
and then I'll kill that shark...
and I'll be a hero...

1148
01:41:19,462 --> 01:41:20,838
I'm pretty sure.

1149
01:41:21,213 --> 01:41:25,594
And I'll help you.
That way we can be on TV.

1150
01:41:28,640 --> 01:41:30,225
Because you love me.

1151
01:41:35,189 --> 01:41:37,568
I'm your wife forever.

1152
01:41:51,043 --> 01:41:54,131
That's baby's asleep, I think.

1153
01:41:55,382 --> 01:41:57,051
It's snoring.

1154
01:41:59,095 --> 01:42:00,514
She's growing.

1155
01:42:01,682 --> 01:42:03,393
She's coming tonight...

1156
01:42:04,145 --> 01:42:05,061
or tomorrow.

1157
01:42:06,689 --> 01:42:08,649
I bet she's pretty.

1158
01:42:09,650 --> 01:42:13,155
I bet she's pretty,
I bet she's pretty like you.

1159
01:42:16,993 --> 01:42:18,621
Where's that place?

1160
01:42:20,164 --> 01:42:22,876
The whole bottom of the ocean.

1161
01:42:24,170 --> 01:42:28,716
There are whole cities there,
with people and dogs.

1162
01:42:29,010 --> 01:42:34,390
There are castles there...
and farms and husbands and wives...

1163
01:42:34,641 --> 01:42:38,814
and babies, and ghosts...

1164
01:42:39,940 --> 01:42:42,150
and silly kissers too.

1165
01:42:42,694 --> 01:42:45,113
And kissers that do this...

1166
01:43:15,944 --> 01:43:18,780
- It's mama, I think.
- Is she awake?

1167
01:43:19,240 --> 01:43:20,868
I don't know.

1168
01:43:22,078 --> 01:43:25,038
Because that never happens,
but maybe it happens.

1169
01:43:25,916 --> 01:43:29,295
If mama quit dozing
I'll go see if she wants soup.

1170
01:43:31,423 --> 01:43:32,800
Dickens, I'm scared.

1171
01:43:34,469 --> 01:43:35,887
Me too.

1172
01:43:36,180 --> 01:43:39,809
If we go together, we're safe.

1173
01:43:41,395 --> 01:43:42,729
Yeah, all right.

1174
01:44:02,713 --> 01:44:03,881
Mama?

1175
01:44:11,099 --> 01:44:12,975
It's damn bad.

1176
01:44:19,778 --> 01:44:22,905
Dell says someday mama will wake.

1177
01:44:23,157 --> 01:44:27,871
And she says someday there'll be a
pill or a story or something...

1178
01:44:28,037 --> 01:44:30,998
and that'll make her eyes
come alive again.

1179
01:44:31,208 --> 01:44:35,256
Because if she gets buried
she'll be gone for good.

1180
01:44:36,006 --> 01:44:38,050
That's my gift.

1181
01:44:41,180 --> 01:44:43,474
And that's daddy's map!

1182
01:44:44,518 --> 01:44:46,979
No, no, they're Dell's.

1183
01:44:47,980 --> 01:44:49,565
It's all hers.

1184
01:44:50,943 --> 01:44:53,194
Her place is with mama.

1185
01:45:05,043 --> 01:45:06,628
It's daddy.

1186
01:45:09,591 --> 01:45:13,179
And that's Dell.
She was beautiful once.

1187
01:45:13,387 --> 01:45:15,306
Not a pirate or a ghost.

1188
01:45:16,266 --> 01:45:19,896
She had two good eyes
and she loved your daddy.

1189
01:45:21,481 --> 01:45:23,484
They were kissers.

1190
01:45:23,775 --> 01:45:25,612
Young kissers.

1191
01:45:26,238 --> 01:45:29,365
Dell and my daddy were young kissers.

1192
01:45:29,576 --> 01:45:30,452
No.

1193
01:45:30,659 --> 01:45:32,953
They do it like we do it.

1194
01:45:33,956 --> 01:45:37,586
No, no...

1195
01:45:38,421 --> 01:45:40,381
They do it like we do it.

1196
01:45:43,135 --> 01:45:44,552
I'm Dell...

1197
01:45:44,929 --> 01:45:48,682
and you're my daddy...
and we're married...

1198
01:45:49,226 --> 01:45:51,604
and our baby's coming.

1199
01:45:58,529 --> 01:46:00,698
Filth! Evil!

1200
01:46:00,908 --> 01:46:02,576
Rotten! Rotten!

1201
01:46:02,786 --> 01:46:04,287
No, Dell!

1202
01:46:04,537 --> 01:46:09,417
Doing that in here!
Dickens, bringing that nasty...

1203
01:46:09,670 --> 01:46:12,381
- nastiness into our home!
- No, Dell, no.

1204
01:46:12,631 --> 01:46:15,050
This is my room, mama's...

1205
01:46:15,676 --> 01:46:19,681
I'm sorry, Dell, I'm sorry.

1206
01:46:19,932 --> 01:46:21,643
Like father like daughter!

1207
01:46:23,354 --> 01:46:28,527
Spy! Watching in the bushes,
you vile nasty child!

1208
01:46:28,527 --> 01:46:30,279
- I didn't do anything! - Liar!

1209
01:46:30,529 --> 01:46:31,488
Dell...

1210
01:46:31,780 --> 01:46:34,908
Spy... with your little spies!

1211
01:46:35,159 --> 01:46:36,078
No!

1212
01:46:36,537 --> 01:46:39,038
You'll starve now, you hear me?

1213
01:46:39,291 --> 01:46:41,792
No more food for you! No more you!

1214
01:46:42,043 --> 01:46:47,676
Dell, no, Dell!

1215
01:46:52,307 --> 01:46:54,976
Now. Who have we here?

1216
01:46:56,229 --> 01:46:57,646
It's Mustique!

1217
01:46:57,898 --> 01:46:59,274
A troublesome creature.

1218
01:46:59,442 --> 01:47:02,444
- She's mine! I hate you!
- I don't think so. No, no, no.

1219
01:47:05,949 --> 01:47:08,994
Now look at what you done.
Look at what you done now!

1220
01:47:10,497 --> 01:47:11,748
All right.

1221
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,252
All right, my boy.

1222
01:47:14,502 --> 01:47:17,421
- Dell's here. Dell's got...
- Leave him alone!

1223
01:47:17,672 --> 01:47:19,800
- Leave him! Witch!
- Get off me!

1224
01:47:20,010 --> 01:47:21,470
Leave him!

1225
01:47:27,353 --> 01:47:28,729
Mama.

1226
01:47:31,358 --> 01:47:33,734
I've got your hat, you witch!

1227
01:47:33,944 --> 01:47:36,197
Now you'll get stung by bees and die.

1228
01:47:36,448 --> 01:47:39,326
You'll die.
And get out in the earth and die!

1229
01:47:39,577 --> 01:47:40,619
Mama.

1230
01:48:02,398 --> 01:48:03,524
You're gonna die now!

1231
01:48:13,203 --> 01:48:15,663
I didn't do anything! I didn't!

1232
01:48:16,082 --> 01:48:18,292
I didn't do anything!

1233
01:48:20,337 --> 01:48:23,381
She's got them all, daddy. I'm next.

1234
01:48:23,591 --> 01:48:27,345
When she finds the squirrel gone
she'll destroy me for sure.

1235
01:48:28,222 --> 01:48:32,270
Probably she'll hang my head
in her living room!

1236
01:48:39,988 --> 01:48:43,576
You're dreaming yourself
far away, daddy.

1237
01:48:44,911 --> 01:48:47,829
Further than the Hundred Years Ocean.

1238
01:48:50,292 --> 01:48:52,252
Beyond Jutland...

1239
01:48:53,005 --> 01:48:57,426
deep, deep, deep...
in the place where dreams are made.

1240
01:49:00,221 --> 01:49:02,140
We'll be a happy family.

1241
01:49:04,185 --> 01:49:07,774
We'll build a castle of crooked branches...

1242
01:49:08,483 --> 01:49:10,443
and flattened pennies.

1243
01:49:11,987 --> 01:49:13,322
Eat meat...

1244
01:49:13,907 --> 01:49:17,912
and butter tarts... and drink lemonade...

1245
01:49:18,162 --> 01:49:21,207
from gold-plated paper cups.

1246
01:49:24,753 --> 01:49:27,215
I'll dream myself there too.

1247
01:49:28,341 --> 01:49:32,555
If I shut my eyes and try hard enough...

1248
01:49:33,556 --> 01:49:36,726
maybe I'll wake inside your dream.

1249
01:49:59,590 --> 01:50:01,676
The end of the world.

1250
01:51:44,391 --> 01:51:45,518
Dickens!

1251
01:51:48,856 --> 01:51:53,612
You killed it!
You killed the monster shark, Dickens!

1252
01:51:55,532 --> 01:51:57,199
I love you.

1253
01:52:09,841 --> 01:52:10,926
Little girl.

1254
01:52:12,845 --> 01:52:14,264
Are you hurt?

1255
01:52:15,097 --> 01:52:16,975
Are you okay, little girl?

1256
01:52:20,939 --> 01:52:23,024
I'm hungry is all.

1257
01:52:26,154 --> 01:52:28,948
Well, here... I have something.

1258
01:52:36,835 --> 01:52:40,381
Are you traveling alone
or with someone?

1259
01:52:41,966 --> 01:52:43,176
Don't know.

1260
01:52:45,179 --> 01:52:47,597
I guess Dickens will come and get me.

1261
01:52:48,015 --> 01:52:49,935
I'm pretty sure he will.

1262
01:52:53,189 --> 01:52:55,608
So your parents weren't on the train?

1263
01:53:00,782 --> 01:53:02,867
You're all alone like me then.

1264
01:53:04,787 --> 01:53:06,497
It happened so fast.

1265
01:53:07,289 --> 01:53:08,792
So fast.

1266
01:53:09,711 --> 01:53:13,006
We're two of the lucky ones...
thank God.

1267
01:53:15,051 --> 01:53:17,970
Very, very lucky.

1268
01:53:19,097 --> 01:53:23,645
Dickens? Dickens?

1269
01:53:25,230 --> 01:53:26,858
Dickens?

1270
01:53:28,067 --> 01:53:30,569
- You stay far. - Dickens?

1271
01:53:30,945 --> 01:53:32,780
Mess elsewhere.

1272
01:53:32,990 --> 01:53:34,783
Dickens?

1273
01:53:35,076 --> 01:53:39,582
Where are you, boy? Dickens?

1274
01:53:41,501 --> 01:53:43,462
My captain.

1275
01:53:44,005 --> 01:53:46,215
It's okay. It's okay.

1276
01:53:48,676 --> 01:53:50,304
We're safe now.

1277
01:53:53,893 --> 01:53:56,354
We'll take care of each other,
how's that?

1278
01:53:57,480 --> 01:54:00,317
And I'll make sure you get
where you're going.

1279
01:54:22,345 --> 01:54:25,640
They're beautiful. Aren't they?

1280
01:54:30,855 --> 01:54:33,109
They're my friends, you know.

1281
01:54:34,362 --> 01:54:36,154
They have names.
