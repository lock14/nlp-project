1
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,352
Stop now.

2
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:18,752
Tell me where it is.

3
00:02:24,336 --> 00:02:28,432
You and your brethren possess
what is not rightfully yours.

4
00:02:29,007 --> 00:02:32,966
I don't know what
you are talking about.

5
00:02:33,345 --> 00:02:36,007
Is it a secret you will die for?

6
00:02:37,182 --> 00:02:39,480
- Please.
- As you wish.

7
00:02:39,918 --> 00:02:41,283
Wait!

8
00:02:45,423 --> 00:02:47,584
My God, forgive me.

9
00:02:49,094 --> 00:02:51,062
In the sacristy...

10
00:02:51,363 --> 00:02:54,696
...the church of Saint-Sulpice,
is the Rose Line.

11
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,027
Beneath the Rose.

12
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:01,203
Thank you.

13
00:03:34,973 --> 00:03:36,099
Thank you.

14
00:03:37,075 --> 00:03:38,042
Thank you.

15
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:54,223
Symbols are a language that
can help us understand our past.

16
00:03:54,825 --> 00:03:59,125
As the saying goes,
a picture says a thousand words...

17
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:02,322
...but which words?

18
00:04:03,167 --> 00:04:06,659
Interpret for me, please, this symbol.
First thing that comes to mind.

19
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:09,168
- Hatred, racism.
- Ku Klux Klan.

20
00:04:09,373 --> 00:04:14,640
Yes, yes, interesting. But they would
disagree with you in Spain.

21
00:04:14,945 --> 00:04:18,278
There, they are robes
worn by priests.

22
00:04:18,616 --> 00:04:20,641
Now this symbol. Anyone?

23
00:04:21,018 --> 00:04:22,007
Evil.

24
00:04:23,287 --> 00:04:24,413
In English, please.

25
00:04:24,622 --> 00:04:25,680
Devil's pitchfork.

26
00:04:25,889 --> 00:04:28,050
Poor, poor Poseidon.

27
00:04:28,525 --> 00:04:33,758
That is his trident. A symbol of power
to millions of the ancients.

28
00:04:33,964 --> 00:04:35,124
Now this symbol.

29
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,668
- Madonna and child.
- Faith. Christianity.

30
00:04:38,869 --> 00:04:42,600
No. No, it's the pagan god
Horus and his mother, Isis...

31
00:04:42,806 --> 00:04:45,366
...centuries before
the birth of Christ.

32
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:49,273
Understanding our past
determines actively...

33
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,540
...our ability to understand
the present.

34
00:04:52,883 --> 00:04:57,377
So how do we sift truth from belief?

35
00:04:57,655 --> 00:05:01,182
How do we write our own histories,
personally or culturally...

36
00:05:01,392 --> 00:05:03,451
...and thereby define ourselves?

37
00:05:03,661 --> 00:05:08,030
How do we penetrate years,
centuries, of historical distortion...

38
00:05:08,465 --> 00:05:11,263
...to find original truth?

39
00:05:11,468 --> 00:05:14,665
Tonight, this will be our quest.

40
00:05:14,905 --> 00:05:18,204
I still think that his whole take on phi
was a little far-fetched.

41
00:05:18,409 --> 00:05:24,575
I don't think so. I think that the
golden ratio is everywhere in nature.

42
00:05:25,516 --> 00:05:27,006
Sure, I can do that.

43
00:05:27,217 --> 00:05:30,186
My son is a student
of yours at Harvard.

44
00:05:30,387 --> 00:05:32,617
- Michael Culp? He adores you.
- Oh, yeah.

45
00:05:32,856 --> 00:05:34,881
He says you're the best teacher
he's ever had.

46
00:05:35,092 --> 00:05:39,051
Ms. Culp, I think I already gave
Michael an A-minus.

47
00:05:39,263 --> 00:05:40,628
He told me. Thank you.

48
00:05:40,831 --> 00:05:42,128
Mr. Langdon?

49
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:44,164
Hi.

50
00:05:44,501 --> 00:05:45,729
Bonjour, professor.

51
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:51,939
I'm Lieutenant Collet from DCPJ.
A kind of French FBI.

52
00:05:52,443 --> 00:05:55,003
Will you take a look
at this photo, please?

53
00:05:55,212 --> 00:05:58,079
My police chief, Capitaine Fache,
had hoped...

54
00:05:58,282 --> 00:06:01,843
...considering your expertise
and the markings on the body...

55
00:06:02,052 --> 00:06:03,519
...you might assist us.

56
00:06:12,229 --> 00:06:14,322
Will you excuse me a moment?

57
00:06:17,601 --> 00:06:19,432
I was supposed to have
drinks with him.

58
00:06:19,636 --> 00:06:20,830
Yes, we know.

59
00:06:22,172 --> 00:06:24,299
We found your name
in his daily planner.

60
00:06:25,476 --> 00:06:28,240
He never showed.
I waited for over an hour.

61
00:06:31,482 --> 00:06:34,144
Why would someone do this to him?

62
00:06:34,351 --> 00:06:37,411
Oh, you misunderstand, professor.

63
00:06:37,821 --> 00:06:39,880
He was shot, yes.

64
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:42,750
But what you see
in the photograph...

65
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,554
...Monsieur Sauniere did to himself.

66
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:52,965
Teacher, all four are dead.

67
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:56,896
The senechaux and the
Grand Master himself.

68
00:06:57,106 --> 00:07:00,166
Then I assume
you have the location.

69
00:07:00,376 --> 00:07:03,436
Confirmed by all.

70
00:07:03,646 --> 00:07:06,046
Independently.

71
00:07:06,849 --> 00:07:11,149
I had feared the Priory's penchant
for secrecy might prevail.

72
00:07:14,724 --> 00:07:18,785
The prospect of death
is strong motivation.

73
00:07:22,265 --> 00:07:24,631
It is here.

74
00:07:24,934 --> 00:07:27,334
In Paris, Teacher.

75
00:07:28,304 --> 00:07:33,742
It hides beneath the Rose
in Saint-Sulpice.

76
00:07:34,277 --> 00:07:36,973
You will go forth, Silas.

77
00:08:49,986 --> 00:08:53,422
I chastise my body.

78
00:09:31,227 --> 00:09:33,320
Capitaine Fache is waiting for you.

79
00:09:41,671 --> 00:09:42,968
Okay.

80
00:09:54,283 --> 00:09:55,716
- Mr. Langdon.
- Yes.

81
00:09:56,252 --> 00:09:58,152
I'm Captain Bezu Fache.

82
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,585
You like our pyramid?

83
00:10:00,789 --> 00:10:01,847
It's magnificent.

84
00:10:02,691 --> 00:10:04,591
A scar on the face of Paris.

85
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,557
After me, please.

86
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:17,363
It's the pairing
of those two pyramids.

87
00:10:17,872 --> 00:10:19,169
It's unique.

88
00:10:19,374 --> 00:10:21,501
The two are geometric echoes.

89
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:22,677
Fascinating.

90
00:10:25,447 --> 00:10:28,974
I'm not sure how much help
I'm gonna be here this evening.

91
00:10:33,555 --> 00:10:35,546
How well did you know the curator?

92
00:10:35,757 --> 00:10:38,954
Not at all. We met only once.

93
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,458
We were on a...

94
00:10:41,663 --> 00:10:43,824
On a panel together.

95
00:10:44,032 --> 00:10:46,626
Something is funny?

96
00:10:46,935 --> 00:10:48,493
We didn't agree on much.

97
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:52,264
Frankly, I was surprised
when he contacted me.

98
00:11:00,348 --> 00:11:02,714
Could we take the stairs?

99
00:11:17,298 --> 00:11:20,563
So Sauniere requested
tonight's meeting.

100
00:11:20,769 --> 00:11:21,895
Yes.

101
00:11:22,103 --> 00:11:23,570
How? Did he call you?

102
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,471
E-mail. He heard I was in Paris.

103
00:11:29,544 --> 00:11:31,341
Had something to discuss.

104
00:11:31,546 --> 00:11:32,638
What?

105
00:11:37,686 --> 00:11:40,951
You seem uncomfortable.

106
00:11:56,104 --> 00:11:59,699
- Are any of those real?
- Of course not.

107
00:11:59,908 --> 00:12:03,639
So you know something
of security procedures.

108
00:12:03,845 --> 00:12:08,043
Well, I know video surveillance in
a museum this size is cost-prohibitive.

109
00:12:08,249 --> 00:12:10,740
Most now rely on containment.

110
00:12:10,952 --> 00:12:14,149
Yes, forget about
keeping the criminals out.

111
00:12:14,355 --> 00:12:16,516
Now we keep them in.

112
00:12:22,097 --> 00:12:26,158
The Grand Gallery.
This is where you found the body.

113
00:12:26,367 --> 00:12:28,130
How would you know that?

114
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:34,073
I recognize the parquet floor
from the Polaroid. It's unmistakable.

115
00:12:43,485 --> 00:12:44,782
Dear God.

116
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:50,890
Let's cover the talking points again,
Your Eminence.

117
00:12:51,092 --> 00:12:53,959
Many call Opus Dei
a brainwashing cult.

118
00:12:54,162 --> 00:12:57,325
Others, an ultraconservative
Christian secret society.

119
00:12:57,532 --> 00:13:00,228
- We are a simple Catholic church.
- Simple?

120
00:13:00,435 --> 00:13:03,165
With a brand-new $47-million
headquarters in Manhattan.

121
00:13:03,371 --> 00:13:06,430
Our followers are generous,
should we apologize for that?

122
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,938
Perhaps a less defensive tack,
Your Eminence.

123
00:13:09,143 --> 00:13:11,270
The press continue
to be harsh with us.

124
00:13:13,113 --> 00:13:17,243
We are not Cafeteria Catholics.

125
00:13:17,451 --> 00:13:19,476
We don't pick and choose
which rules to follow.

126
00:13:19,686 --> 00:13:22,314
We follow doctrine. Rigorously.

127
00:13:23,123 --> 00:13:26,854
Does doctrine necessarily
include vows of chastity, tithing...

128
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:30,188
...and atonement for sins through
self-flagellation and the cilice?

129
00:13:30,764 --> 00:13:34,825
Many of our followers are married.
Many of them have families.

130
00:13:35,135 --> 00:13:37,968
Only a small proportion
choose to live ascetically...

131
00:13:38,172 --> 00:13:40,766
...in the cloisters
of our residential halls.

132
00:13:41,809 --> 00:13:44,277
But we are all united in God's work
around the world.

133
00:13:44,478 --> 00:13:48,278
Surely that is an admirable way
to lead one's life.

134
00:13:48,816 --> 00:13:51,341
Why are some media referring
to Opus Dei as "God's mafia"?

135
00:13:51,552 --> 00:13:55,283
Obviously, some people fear
what they don't understand.

136
00:13:56,924 --> 00:13:59,392
And because the war finally
draws to a close.

137
00:13:59,593 --> 00:14:03,586
- Bishop, we need to stay on message.
- That will be all, Michael, thank you.

138
00:14:03,797 --> 00:14:04,991
Aringarosa.

139
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:09,829
Silas has succeeded.
The legend is true.

140
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:12,035
It hides beneath the Rose.

141
00:14:12,372 --> 00:14:15,364
My part of our bargain
is nearly fulfilled.

142
00:14:15,943 --> 00:14:18,969
I meet the council in an hour.

143
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:23,010
I will have your money tonight,
Teacher.

144
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:26,078
The Vitruvian Man.

145
00:14:26,286 --> 00:14:29,483
It's one of Leonardo da Vinci's
most famous sketches.

146
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:31,624
And the star on his skin?

147
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:33,092
A pentacle.

148
00:14:33,293 --> 00:14:34,920
And its meaning?

149
00:14:35,128 --> 00:14:36,493
The pentacle is ancient.

150
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:42,562
Symbols carry different meanings
in different settings.

151
00:14:42,769 --> 00:14:45,363
This symbol, professor.
This setting.

152
00:14:45,572 --> 00:14:47,767
The pentacle is
a pagan religious icon.

153
00:14:48,442 --> 00:14:50,000
Devil worship.

154
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:54,977
No. No, no, no.
The pentacle before that.

155
00:14:55,482 --> 00:14:57,643
This is a symbol for Venus.

156
00:14:58,285 --> 00:15:00,651
It represents the female half
of all things.

157
00:15:00,854 --> 00:15:04,017
It's a concept called "the divine
goddess" by religious historians.

158
00:15:05,659 --> 00:15:08,753
You are telling me that
Sauniere's last act on earth...

159
00:15:08,962 --> 00:15:13,399
...was to draw a goddess symbol
on his chest? Why?

160
00:15:14,768 --> 00:15:18,033
Captain Fache,
obviously I can't tell you why.

161
00:15:18,939 --> 00:15:22,534
I can tell you he, as well as anyone,
knows the meaning of this symbol...

162
00:15:22,743 --> 00:15:25,473
...and it has nothing to do
with worshiping the devil.

163
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:27,044
- Is that so?
- Yes.

164
00:15:27,247 --> 00:15:28,475
Then...

165
00:15:29,816 --> 00:15:31,613
...what do you make of this?

166
00:15:32,052 --> 00:15:36,284
"O, Draconian devil.
Oh, lame saint."

167
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:39,687
It's a phrase.
Doesn't mean anything, not to me.

168
00:15:40,027 --> 00:15:43,554
What would you do if you had such
limited time to send a message?

169
00:15:45,065 --> 00:15:49,627
Well, I suppose
I'd try to identify my killer.

170
00:15:50,337 --> 00:15:51,429
Precisely.

171
00:15:52,172 --> 00:15:53,799
Precisely.

172
00:15:54,007 --> 00:15:55,099
So, professor...

173
00:15:56,576 --> 00:15:58,635
Officer Neveu.

174
00:15:58,845 --> 00:16:00,335
Please, pardon the interruption.

175
00:16:00,547 --> 00:16:01,514
This is not the time.

176
00:16:01,715 --> 00:16:03,842
I received the crime-scene jpegs
at headquarters...

177
00:16:04,051 --> 00:16:05,848
...and I've deciphered the code.

178
00:16:06,186 --> 00:16:07,744
It's a Fibonacci sequence.

179
00:16:07,955 --> 00:16:10,354
That's the code Sauniere
left on the floor.

180
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:12,783
Headquarters sent me
to explain, captain.

181
00:16:12,992 --> 00:16:14,254
It is the Fibonacci sequence.

182
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:15,927
The numbers are out of order.

183
00:16:16,128 --> 00:16:18,926
But before that, I have an urgent
message for Professor Langdon.

184
00:16:19,131 --> 00:16:20,564
Right?

185
00:16:20,766 --> 00:16:21,994
Pardon me?

186
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:27,430
I'm Sophie Neveu,
French police, Cryptology.

187
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,631
Your embassy called Division.

188
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,712
I'm sorry, monsieur, they said
it was a matter of life and death.

189
00:16:39,652 --> 00:16:43,053
This is the number of your
embassy's messaging service.

190
00:16:43,656 --> 00:16:45,021
Well, thank you.

191
00:16:52,331 --> 00:16:54,492
Hello, you've reached
the home of Sophie Neveu.

192
00:16:55,434 --> 00:16:58,130
Miss Neveu? This...

193
00:16:58,337 --> 00:16:59,861
No. That's the right number.

194
00:17:00,072 --> 00:17:02,563
You have to dial an access code
to pick up your messages.

195
00:17:02,775 --> 00:17:03,742
But I'm getting...

196
00:17:03,943 --> 00:17:06,844
It's a three-digit code.
It's on the paper I gave you.

197
00:17:15,855 --> 00:17:18,915
Professor Langdon,
do not react to this message.

198
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:22,356
You must follow my directions
very closely and, above all...

199
00:17:22,561 --> 00:17:24,859
...reveal nothing to Captain Fache.

200
00:17:25,064 --> 00:17:27,123
You are in grave danger.

201
00:17:40,479 --> 00:17:41,969
Church of Saint-Sulpice.

202
00:17:42,248 --> 00:17:43,840
Good evening, Sister.

203
00:17:44,884 --> 00:17:48,650
I need you to show someone
our church tonight.

204
00:17:49,088 --> 00:17:50,487
Of course, Father.

205
00:17:51,057 --> 00:17:52,718
But so late?

206
00:17:53,993 --> 00:17:54,960
Wouldn't tomorrow...?

207
00:17:55,161 --> 00:17:59,894
This is a request from an
important bishop of Opus Dei.

208
00:18:00,633 --> 00:18:03,067
It would be my pleasure.

209
00:18:26,992 --> 00:18:30,052
There's been an accident. A friend.

210
00:18:30,262 --> 00:18:32,253
I have to fly home in the morning.

211
00:18:32,465 --> 00:18:33,727
I see.

212
00:18:33,933 --> 00:18:37,960
Is there a restroom I could use? I just
wanna splash some water on my face.

213
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:39,330
Yes.

214
00:18:41,474 --> 00:18:44,773
She said it is meaningless.

215
00:18:45,077 --> 00:18:46,874
Mathematical joke.

216
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,711
Is it meaningless?

217
00:18:52,384 --> 00:18:54,409
I'll take another look
when I come back.

218
00:18:58,324 --> 00:19:00,758
I'm sorry. Of course.

219
00:19:18,543 --> 00:19:20,773
Do you have a message
from Sauniere?

220
00:19:21,479 --> 00:19:23,106
What are you talking about?

221
00:19:24,249 --> 00:19:25,682
Crazy old man.

222
00:19:25,884 --> 00:19:28,478
You have me confused with
someone else.

223
00:19:28,686 --> 00:19:30,449
I was asked to come here
and consult.

224
00:19:30,655 --> 00:19:32,520
No, you are
sous surveillance cachee.

225
00:19:32,724 --> 00:19:34,316
Yes, and...

226
00:19:34,526 --> 00:19:36,118
What?

227
00:19:36,327 --> 00:19:40,229
Bring the suspect to the crime scene
and hope he incriminates himself.

228
00:19:40,431 --> 00:19:41,455
Suspect?

229
00:19:42,066 --> 00:19:43,693
Check your jacket pocket.

230
00:19:45,003 --> 00:19:46,300
Just look.

231
00:19:50,675 --> 00:19:52,040
GPS tracking dot.

232
00:19:52,243 --> 00:19:55,303
Accurate within two feet
anywhere on the globe.

233
00:19:55,513 --> 00:19:59,074
The agent who picked you up
slipped it into your jacket...

234
00:20:00,518 --> 00:20:02,577
...in case you tried to run.

235
00:20:04,155 --> 00:20:06,783
We have you on a little leash,
professor.

236
00:20:16,234 --> 00:20:18,327
Why would I try to run?
I didn't do anything.

237
00:20:18,536 --> 00:20:22,563
So, what do you think about
the fourth line of text...

238
00:20:22,774 --> 00:20:25,641
...Fache wiped clean
before you arrived?

239
00:20:31,482 --> 00:20:35,646
He brought you here to force a
confession, Professor Langdon.

240
00:20:38,489 --> 00:20:41,219
He's still in there?
What's he doing?

241
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:49,363
Fache isn't even looking
for other suspects, okay?

242
00:20:49,601 --> 00:20:51,091
He is sure you're guilty.

243
00:20:54,739 --> 00:20:57,333
When did Sauniere contact you?

244
00:20:57,542 --> 00:20:58,566
- Today?
- Yes, yes.

245
00:20:58,776 --> 00:21:00,835
What time? What time?

246
00:21:01,045 --> 00:21:02,876
At 3. Around 3. Three.

247
00:21:03,081 --> 00:21:05,777
The gallery alarm was triggered at 8.
You were...

248
00:21:05,984 --> 00:21:07,679
- I was giving a lecture.
- At 9.

249
00:21:07,885 --> 00:21:12,652
You had the privacy light on
in your hotel room until 8:30, right?

250
00:21:12,857 --> 00:21:16,554
We call Fache "the Bull."
Once he starts, he doesn't stop.

251
00:21:16,761 --> 00:21:19,924
He can arrest you and detain you
for months while he builds a case.

252
00:21:20,131 --> 00:21:23,498
And by then whatever Sauniere
wanted you to tell me will be useless.

253
00:21:23,701 --> 00:21:25,760
Stop it! Just stop!

254
00:21:26,404 --> 00:21:27,894
Who are you?

255
00:21:28,106 --> 00:21:30,438
What are you talking about?
Tell you what?

256
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:34,006
Maybe who really killed him.

257
00:21:40,652 --> 00:21:43,212
The Fibonacci sequence.

258
00:21:43,421 --> 00:21:45,582
I believe Sauniere wrote it...

259
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:48,657
...so his investigation would
include cryptographers.

260
00:21:52,764 --> 00:21:54,493
That's quite a leap, isn't it?

261
00:21:54,699 --> 00:21:56,132
No.

262
00:21:57,435 --> 00:21:59,062
And the letters.

263
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:00,328
"P.S."

264
00:22:00,538 --> 00:22:02,199
P.S., postscript.

265
00:22:06,144 --> 00:22:10,103
"Princess Sophie."
Yeah. Silly, I know.

266
00:22:10,315 --> 00:22:13,216
But I was only a girl
when I lived with him.

267
00:22:18,756 --> 00:22:21,280
Jacques Sauniere
was my grandfather.

268
00:22:26,463 --> 00:22:29,796
Apparently, it was his dying wish
that we meet.

269
00:22:31,601 --> 00:22:33,796
If you help me understand why...

270
00:22:34,004 --> 00:22:37,667
...I will get you to your embassy,
where we cannot arrest you.

271
00:22:38,942 --> 00:22:41,672
Fache was never gonna let me
just stroll out of here, was he?

272
00:22:42,412 --> 00:22:43,709
No.

273
00:22:44,614 --> 00:22:48,414
If we are to get away from here,
we must find another way.

274
00:22:59,463 --> 00:23:01,727
What exactly do you propose?

275
00:23:11,274 --> 00:23:14,072
Sauniere was reading his book.

276
00:23:14,511 --> 00:23:16,445
"Blood trail."

277
00:23:18,382 --> 00:23:20,179
Excuse me, captain.

278
00:23:20,384 --> 00:23:24,411
Crypto called.
They identified the code.

279
00:23:24,621 --> 00:23:26,418
Neveu told us already.

280
00:23:26,623 --> 00:23:30,423
I should have fired her on the spot,
barging in like that.

281
00:23:30,627 --> 00:23:32,492
Yes.

282
00:23:32,696 --> 00:23:35,256
Except they didn't send Neveu.

283
00:23:37,734 --> 00:23:38,860
What?

284
00:23:39,069 --> 00:23:42,470
Captain, look at this.

285
00:23:44,174 --> 00:23:45,402
He jumped!

286
00:23:45,809 --> 00:23:46,867
Shit.

287
00:23:49,212 --> 00:23:52,306
He's moving again. And fast.

288
00:23:52,916 --> 00:23:54,679
He must be in a car.

289
00:23:56,119 --> 00:24:00,283
He's going south
on Pont du Carrousel.

290
00:24:09,032 --> 00:24:10,294
Bastard.

291
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:36,916
That cop will check
the whole lower floor.

292
00:24:40,564 --> 00:24:42,862
I will only take a moment.

293
00:24:43,366 --> 00:24:44,628
Of course.

294
00:24:53,343 --> 00:24:55,504
He is much older than I remember.

295
00:25:07,257 --> 00:25:10,658
I hadn't seen or spoken to him
in a very long time.

296
00:25:19,769 --> 00:25:23,728
He phoned my office today.
Several times.

297
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,932
He said it was a matter
of life and death.

298
00:25:28,477 --> 00:25:31,810
I thought it was another trick
to get back in touch.

299
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:37,385
It seems when
he couldn't speak to me...

300
00:25:38,521 --> 00:25:40,512
...he reached out to you.

301
00:25:46,729 --> 00:25:49,425
Whatever he needed
so badly to say...

302
00:25:50,499 --> 00:25:53,297
...he found neither of us in time.

303
00:26:19,562 --> 00:26:21,928
- Wait a minute.
- Professor?

304
00:26:22,932 --> 00:26:24,695
Come on.

305
00:26:25,034 --> 00:26:26,626
It can't be that easy.

306
00:26:27,603 --> 00:26:30,834
This is wrong.
Yeah. See? This is wrong.

307
00:26:32,374 --> 00:26:36,003
The Fibonacci numbers only
make sense when they're in order.

308
00:26:36,211 --> 00:26:37,678
These are scrambled.

309
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:41,611
If he was trying to reach out,
maybe he was doing it in code.

310
00:26:41,817 --> 00:26:43,682
Would you hold this, please?

311
00:26:45,821 --> 00:26:47,948
This phrase is meaningless.

312
00:26:50,125 --> 00:26:54,585
Unless you assume these letters
are out of order too.

313
00:26:54,797 --> 00:26:55,957
An anagram.

314
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:09,507
You have eidetic memory?

315
00:27:09,812 --> 00:27:13,339
Not quite. But I can pretty much
remember what I see.

316
00:27:34,737 --> 00:27:36,671
Anagram is right.

317
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:40,633
"O, Draconian devil. Oh, lame saint"
becomes:

318
00:27:40,843 --> 00:27:43,471
"Leonardo da Vinci.
The Mona Lisa."

319
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:47,342
Professor, the Mona Lisa
is right over here.

320
00:27:53,656 --> 00:27:58,593
Look at this. He must have
thrown it from the window.

321
00:27:58,961 --> 00:28:00,519
Smart to hit the truck.

322
00:28:00,963 --> 00:28:04,455
What, you admire him now?

323
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:08,160
We're stupid.
Who did we leave at the museum?

324
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:11,100
Ledoux? Get him on the radio!

325
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,500
Her smile is in
the lower spatial frequencies.

326
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:18,305
The horizon is significantly lower
on the left than it is on the right.

327
00:28:18,514 --> 00:28:19,572
Why?

328
00:28:19,782 --> 00:28:23,081
Well, see, she appears larger
from the left than on the right.

329
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:26,345
Historically, the left was female,
the right was male.

330
00:28:27,189 --> 00:28:28,656
The sacred feminine.

331
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:31,383
Why do you say that?

332
00:28:31,592 --> 00:28:35,858
Something Sauniere said
the first time we came here.

333
00:28:38,666 --> 00:28:40,395
There. Blood.

334
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,806
Hey.

335
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:58,178
"So dark the con of man."

336
00:28:58,953 --> 00:29:02,252
No. It doesn't say that.

337
00:29:02,457 --> 00:29:04,789
Is it another anagram?
Can you break it?

338
00:29:09,697 --> 00:29:12,165
Professor, hurry. Hurry!

339
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:16,804
Moon. Sermon. Charms.

340
00:29:17,004 --> 00:29:20,963
Demons. Omens. Codes.
Monks. Ranks. Rocks.

341
00:29:21,175 --> 00:29:22,233
Madonna of the Rocks.

342
00:29:23,044 --> 00:29:24,102
Da Vinci.

343
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:36,251
Careful. Careful.

344
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:47,566
This can't be this. The fleur-de-lis.

345
00:30:05,653 --> 00:30:06,950
Stay where you are!

346
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:10,757
Let go of the painting...

347
00:30:10,958 --> 00:30:12,755
...and put it on the ground.

348
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:18,923
No. You put your gun down.

349
00:30:19,133 --> 00:30:21,158
Now!

350
00:30:21,369 --> 00:30:23,030
Or else I will destroy the painting.

351
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:27,204
Hurry up!

352
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:29,338
Slide your gun to me.

353
00:30:32,246 --> 00:30:33,611
Be careful.

354
00:30:33,815 --> 00:30:35,840
I never really liked this painting.

355
00:30:56,704 --> 00:30:58,035
Run.

356
00:31:28,169 --> 00:31:29,830
It was Sauniere's.

357
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:33,406
I remember finding it once
when I was a girl.

358
00:31:34,275 --> 00:31:36,504
He'd promised
he'd give it to me one day.

359
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:39,505
Have you ever heard
those words before, Sophie?

360
00:31:39,713 --> 00:31:41,112
"So dark the con of man"?

361
00:31:41,314 --> 00:31:42,906
No. Have you?

362
00:31:43,116 --> 00:31:46,552
When you were a child, were you
aware of any secret gatherings?

363
00:31:47,754 --> 00:31:50,086
Anything ritualistic in nature?

364
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:53,555
Meetings your grandfather
would've wanted kept secret?

365
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:57,196
Was there ever any talk of something
called the Priory of Sion?

366
00:31:57,397 --> 00:32:00,332
The what? Why are you
asking these things?

367
00:32:00,533 --> 00:32:03,001
The Priory of Sion is a myth.

368
00:32:03,203 --> 00:32:07,663
One of the world's oldest and most
secret societies, with leaders like...

369
00:32:07,874 --> 00:32:10,365
...Sir Isaac Newton,
da Vinci himself.

370
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:12,607
The fleur-de-lis is their crest.

371
00:32:12,812 --> 00:32:15,337
They're guardians of a secret
they supposedly refer to...

372
00:32:15,548 --> 00:32:17,709
...as "the dark con of man."

373
00:32:18,351 --> 00:32:19,750
But what secret?

374
00:32:20,287 --> 00:32:25,589
The Priory of Sion protects
the source of God's power on earth.

375
00:32:34,501 --> 00:32:36,401
I can't do this by myself.

376
00:32:36,937 --> 00:32:39,872
I'm in enough trouble as it is.
That's my embassy.

377
00:32:40,073 --> 00:32:41,131
Please.

378
00:32:41,341 --> 00:32:42,831
Even if we could get out of this...

379
00:32:43,043 --> 00:32:44,510
Okay.

380
00:33:20,814 --> 00:33:24,181
No, no, no. You're not gonna make it.
You're not gonna make it!

381
00:33:31,825 --> 00:33:33,156
Well, that was...

382
00:33:45,372 --> 00:33:47,169
We won't last long in this car.

383
00:33:47,374 --> 00:33:50,241
Fache doesn't like to be eluded,
even on a good day.

384
00:33:50,443 --> 00:33:52,206
We need to get out of sight.

385
00:34:10,697 --> 00:34:12,927
Christ, give me strength.

386
00:34:25,512 --> 00:34:29,471
You are a ghost.

387
00:34:31,885 --> 00:34:34,115
Christ, give me strength.

388
00:36:09,047 --> 00:36:11,641
Stealing in a house of God!

389
00:36:26,031 --> 00:36:27,999
You are an angel.

390
00:36:30,502 --> 00:36:32,732
Christ, give me strength.

391
00:36:58,197 --> 00:37:00,358
You have powerful friends.

392
00:37:01,099 --> 00:37:04,227
Bishop Aringarosa
has been kind to me.

393
00:37:04,836 --> 00:37:08,829
I could not miss this chance
to pray inside the Saint-Sulpice.

394
00:37:09,708 --> 00:37:12,176
A pity you couldn't wait for morning.

395
00:37:12,377 --> 00:37:14,345
The light is not ideal.

396
00:37:15,214 --> 00:37:19,344
Tell me, Sister, please,
of the Rose Line.

397
00:37:19,785 --> 00:37:24,950
A rose line is any line that goes from
the North to South Poles.

398
00:37:25,157 --> 00:37:30,060
Set into the streets of Paris,
135 brass markers...

399
00:37:30,262 --> 00:37:32,787
...mark the world's
first prime meridian...

400
00:37:32,998 --> 00:37:35,432
...which passed through
this very church.

401
00:37:35,634 --> 00:37:37,465
It hides beneath the Rose.

402
00:37:37,669 --> 00:37:38,863
I'm sorry?

403
00:37:40,138 --> 00:37:41,366
Sister.

404
00:37:44,076 --> 00:37:47,374
I do not want to keep you.
I will show myself out.

405
00:37:50,581 --> 00:37:51,707
I insist.

406
00:37:55,987 --> 00:37:58,888
May the peace of the Lord
be with you.

407
00:38:00,791 --> 00:38:02,190
And with you.

408
00:38:24,215 --> 00:38:27,742
Gray Smart Car. Black roof.

409
00:38:27,952 --> 00:38:31,683
Corner of Denain Boulevard
at the train station.

410
00:38:31,889 --> 00:38:32,981
How could you let them get away?

411
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:36,091
Why not just shoot the damn painting?
Imbecile!

412
00:38:36,294 --> 00:38:39,161
You should put his cigar
out in your hand!

413
00:38:39,363 --> 00:38:40,625
Get out of here!

414
00:38:42,833 --> 00:38:48,294
They found Neveu's car
abandoned at the train station.

415
00:38:49,106 --> 00:38:53,975
And two tickets to Brussels paid for
with Langdon's credit card.

416
00:38:54,245 --> 00:38:55,678
A decoy, I'm sure.

417
00:38:55,913 --> 00:38:58,313
All the same,
send an officer to the station.

418
00:38:58,582 --> 00:39:01,176
Question all the taxi drivers.
I'll put this on the wire.

419
00:39:01,419 --> 00:39:04,115
Interpol? We're not sure he's guilty.

420
00:39:04,588 --> 00:39:08,319
I know he's guilty. Beyond a doubt.

421
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:11,460
Robert Langdon is guilty.

422
00:39:20,538 --> 00:39:22,165
This is the Bois de Boulogne?

423
00:39:22,373 --> 00:39:25,206
We should be safe in this park
for a few minutes.

424
00:39:41,992 --> 00:39:45,223
Your police don't patrol this park.

425
00:40:39,283 --> 00:40:40,580
Stay here.

426
00:40:42,219 --> 00:40:43,516
Police.

427
00:40:44,955 --> 00:40:46,252
What do you want?

428
00:41:01,104 --> 00:41:03,129
Fifty euros for all your stuff.

429
00:41:05,408 --> 00:41:07,501
Go and get something to eat.

430
00:41:27,664 --> 00:41:29,689
Did it occur to you
that could be dangerous?

431
00:41:29,899 --> 00:41:33,096
No. And now we have
a place to think.

432
00:41:33,603 --> 00:41:35,298
Any ideas, professor?

433
00:41:36,506 --> 00:41:40,067
You could've just handed me
a piece of a UFO from Area 51.

434
00:41:42,512 --> 00:41:44,571
"What's the next step?"

435
00:41:44,781 --> 00:41:46,408
With him, it's always:

436
00:41:46,616 --> 00:41:49,710
"Sophie, what's the next step?"

437
00:41:50,453 --> 00:41:51,784
Puzzles.

438
00:41:51,988 --> 00:41:53,353
Codes.

439
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:55,450
A treasure hunt.

440
00:41:59,896 --> 00:42:01,158
To find his killer.

441
00:42:05,435 --> 00:42:08,836
Maybe there is something
about this Priory of Sion.

442
00:42:09,038 --> 00:42:10,027
I hope not.

443
00:42:10,306 --> 00:42:15,073
Any Priory story ends in bloodshed.
They were butchered by the Church.

444
00:42:15,478 --> 00:42:18,641
It all started over a thousand
years ago when a French king...

445
00:42:18,848 --> 00:42:21,282
...conquered the holy city
of Jerusalem.

446
00:42:21,484 --> 00:42:24,783
This crusade, one of the most
massive and sweeping in history...

447
00:42:24,988 --> 00:42:28,480
...was actually orchestrated
by a secret brotherhood...

448
00:42:28,691 --> 00:42:30,056
...the Priory of Sion...

449
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:34,321
...and their military arm,
the Knights Templar.

450
00:42:34,764 --> 00:42:37,824
But the Templars were created
to protect the Holy Land.

451
00:42:38,034 --> 00:42:42,027
That was a cover to hide their
true goal, according to this myth.

452
00:42:42,505 --> 00:42:45,702
Supposedly the invasion
was to find an artifact...

453
00:42:45,909 --> 00:42:47,740
...lost since the time of Christ.

454
00:42:47,944 --> 00:42:52,074
An artifact, it was said,
the Church would kill to possess.

455
00:42:52,282 --> 00:42:54,876
Did they find it,
this buried treasure?

456
00:42:56,085 --> 00:42:57,347
Put it this way:

457
00:42:57,554 --> 00:43:00,455
One day the Templars
simply stopped searching.

458
00:43:00,657 --> 00:43:04,115
They quit the Holy Land
and traveled directly to Rome.

459
00:43:04,327 --> 00:43:06,192
Whether they blackmailed
the papacy...

460
00:43:06,396 --> 00:43:08,830
...or the Church bought their silence,
no one knows.

461
00:43:09,032 --> 00:43:13,401
But it is a fact the papacy
declared these Priory knights...

462
00:43:13,603 --> 00:43:17,232
...these Knights Templar,
of limitless power.

463
00:43:17,907 --> 00:43:21,240
By the 1300s, the Templars
had grown too powerful.

464
00:43:21,444 --> 00:43:22,843
Too threatening.

465
00:43:23,212 --> 00:43:25,271
So the Vatican
issued secret orders...

466
00:43:25,481 --> 00:43:28,416
...to be opened simultaneously
all across Europe.

467
00:43:29,152 --> 00:43:33,179
The Pope had declared the
Knights Templar Satan worshipers...

468
00:43:33,389 --> 00:43:37,917
...and said God had charged him with
cleansing the earth of these heretics.

469
00:43:38,127 --> 00:43:40,561
The plan went off like clockwork.

470
00:43:40,763 --> 00:43:43,732
The Templars
were all but exterminated.

471
00:43:43,933 --> 00:43:48,165
The date was October 13th, 1307.
A Friday.

472
00:43:48,371 --> 00:43:50,271
Friday the 13th.

473
00:43:50,506 --> 00:43:53,532
The Pope sent troops
to claim the Priory's treasure...

474
00:43:53,743 --> 00:43:55,335
...but they found nothing.

475
00:43:55,545 --> 00:43:58,775
The few surviving
Knights of the Priory had vanished...

476
00:43:58,981 --> 00:44:01,814
...and the search for their
sacred artifact began again.

477
00:44:02,017 --> 00:44:06,181
What artifact? I've never
heard about any of this.

478
00:44:06,388 --> 00:44:07,878
Yes, you have.

479
00:44:08,256 --> 00:44:10,622
Almost everyone on earth has.

480
00:44:11,159 --> 00:44:14,128
You just know it as the Holy Grail.

481
00:44:19,768 --> 00:44:23,898
Please, Sauniere thought he knew
the location of the Holy Grail?

482
00:44:24,306 --> 00:44:26,206
Maybe more than that.

483
00:44:26,408 --> 00:44:30,310
This cross and the flower,
this could be very old. But look.

484
00:44:30,512 --> 00:44:35,745
This metal here underneath is much
newer, and there's a modern ID stamp.

485
00:44:35,951 --> 00:44:37,816
"Haxo 24."

486
00:44:39,788 --> 00:44:43,155
And these dots.
These dots are read by a laser.

487
00:44:43,358 --> 00:44:47,055
This is more than a pendant.
This is a key your grandfather left you.

488
00:44:47,429 --> 00:44:49,897
He left us, professor.

489
00:44:51,299 --> 00:44:55,633
And vingt-quatre Haxo,
it's not an ID stamp.

490
00:44:56,304 --> 00:44:58,169
It's a street address.

491
00:45:03,045 --> 00:45:04,603
This is Jacques Sauniere.

492
00:45:05,013 --> 00:45:07,811
Please leave a message
after the tone.

493
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:10,882
Please, Monsieur Sauniere,
pick up the phone.

494
00:45:11,186 --> 00:45:12,653
This is Sandrine Bieil.

495
00:45:12,921 --> 00:45:15,151
I have called the list.

496
00:45:15,590 --> 00:45:17,490
I fear the other guardians are dead.

497
00:45:18,093 --> 00:45:19,993
The lie has been told.

498
00:45:20,362 --> 00:45:22,227
The floor panel has been broken.

499
00:45:22,497 --> 00:45:25,898
Please, monsieur, pick up the phone.
I beg you.

500
00:45:26,101 --> 00:45:28,331
Job 38, verse 11.

501
00:45:29,738 --> 00:45:31,672
Do you know it, Sister?

502
00:45:33,475 --> 00:45:35,204
Job 38:11.

503
00:45:36,878 --> 00:45:39,108
Hitherto shalt thou come...

504
00:45:39,981 --> 00:45:41,676
...but no further.

505
00:45:41,883 --> 00:45:43,282
"But no further."

506
00:45:47,422 --> 00:45:49,287
Do you mock me?

507
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:54,487
Where is the keystone?

508
00:45:55,330 --> 00:45:57,059
I do not know.

509
00:45:58,100 --> 00:45:59,226
No.

510
00:46:01,536 --> 00:46:04,266
You are a sister of the Church...

511
00:46:06,241 --> 00:46:09,642
...and yet you serve them:
The Priory.

512
00:46:09,845 --> 00:46:13,838
Jesus had but one true message.
That...

513
00:46:34,069 --> 00:46:36,731
Come, you saints of God.

514
00:46:37,706 --> 00:46:40,300
Hasten, angels of the Lord.

515
00:46:41,076 --> 00:46:43,806
To receive her soul.

516
00:46:44,279 --> 00:46:48,807
And bring her to the sight
of the Almighty.

517
00:46:52,788 --> 00:46:57,350
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

518
00:47:28,622 --> 00:47:30,283
Welcome, bishop.

519
00:47:33,627 --> 00:47:34,821
May Christ be with you.

520
00:47:35,029 --> 00:47:36,997
And also with you.

521
00:47:37,198 --> 00:47:39,826
It's been too long, Manuel.

522
00:47:41,368 --> 00:47:43,393
I saw your press conference.

523
00:47:43,604 --> 00:47:45,003
Very priestly.

524
00:47:45,206 --> 00:47:46,537
Vultures.

525
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:50,039
But you need a good cover
to fly into Italy these days.

526
00:47:53,414 --> 00:47:55,109
So how are things in Rome?

527
00:47:56,417 --> 00:47:57,782
We serve at his pleasure.

528
00:48:00,054 --> 00:48:02,215
Today is today.

529
00:48:02,790 --> 00:48:05,315
But there are many tomorrows.

530
00:48:08,229 --> 00:48:09,924
Vatican cellars.

531
00:48:10,531 --> 00:48:12,692
1976.

532
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:16,859
Seventy-six, a year of independence.
How fitting.

533
00:48:19,273 --> 00:48:21,673
I thought you'd like it.

534
00:48:22,943 --> 00:48:24,376
I'll fetch the others.

535
00:48:44,765 --> 00:48:46,733
Welcome, bishop.

536
00:48:50,204 --> 00:48:52,331
This council is convened.

537
00:49:00,748 --> 00:49:04,275
Our words shall never
pass these walls.

538
00:49:11,191 --> 00:49:12,886
What business, say you?

539
00:49:14,895 --> 00:49:16,920
As you know, my request for funds...

540
00:49:17,131 --> 00:49:21,397
Yes, 20 million euro
in untraceable bearer bonds.

541
00:49:21,602 --> 00:49:24,765
A tad more than petty cash.
Wouldn't you say, bishop?

542
00:49:24,972 --> 00:49:28,203
The endeavor is complex.
Freedom has a high cost.

543
00:49:28,442 --> 00:49:30,410
And, of course, you will deliver us.

544
00:49:30,711 --> 00:49:33,111
How fortunate we are.

545
00:49:33,314 --> 00:49:37,944
I only offer a route to the renewal
of faith for all men.

546
00:49:38,152 --> 00:49:39,414
How humble.

547
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:42,118
Our savior, Bishop Aringarosa.

548
00:49:42,323 --> 00:49:44,416
Were we to grant your request...

549
00:49:44,825 --> 00:49:48,022
...when would
this mission commence?

550
00:49:48,228 --> 00:49:49,991
- Actually, tonight.
- What?

551
00:49:50,464 --> 00:49:52,125
- It has begun.
- We have not agreed.

552
00:49:52,333 --> 00:49:53,857
How dare you presume to...

553
00:49:54,068 --> 00:49:55,797
I do not presume, I act!

554
00:49:56,003 --> 00:49:58,164
The Vatican's unwillingness
to support us...

555
00:49:58,372 --> 00:49:59,964
...is both impious and cowardly.

556
00:50:00,174 --> 00:50:04,304
Blood is being spilled because true
Christian values lie in ruins. No more!

557
00:50:04,945 --> 00:50:08,175
This council has forgotten
its very purpose.

558
00:50:10,883 --> 00:50:12,043
Tonight...

559
00:50:13,086 --> 00:50:15,486
...the Grail will be destroyed.

560
00:50:15,688 --> 00:50:19,624
The Priory's few remaining members
will be silenced.

561
00:50:27,567 --> 00:50:31,799
I was contacted by a man
who calls himself only "the Teacher."

562
00:50:32,171 --> 00:50:35,402
He knows a great deal
about this council.

563
00:50:36,009 --> 00:50:38,307
And about the Priory.

564
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:56,285
Two prostitutes identified
Langdon and Neveu...

565
00:50:56,496 --> 00:50:58,691
...getting into a taxi
in the Bois de Boulogne.

566
00:51:13,379 --> 00:51:15,313
Because of your expertise?

567
00:51:16,482 --> 00:51:17,949
- I'm sorry?
- About the Priory.

568
00:51:18,151 --> 00:51:20,585
Do you think that's why
Sauniere sought you out?

569
00:51:21,187 --> 00:51:24,281
I can think of dozens of scholars
who know a lot more about it.

570
00:51:24,490 --> 00:51:28,551
Actually, I didn't think
he liked me very much.

571
00:51:29,228 --> 00:51:32,664
Once made a joke at my expense.
Got a big laugh out of it.

572
00:51:32,865 --> 00:51:34,196
What was it?

573
00:51:47,447 --> 00:51:49,210
How may I help you?

574
00:51:55,121 --> 00:51:57,385
The door to the right, please.

575
00:52:08,334 --> 00:52:10,894
That was quite a performance.

576
00:52:12,672 --> 00:52:15,835
The little shit should know better
than to play politics with me.

577
00:52:21,114 --> 00:52:23,412
I know I got in front of you,
old friend.

578
00:52:25,418 --> 00:52:27,318
I did what I thought was best.

579
00:52:34,994 --> 00:52:36,518
So...

580
00:52:36,729 --> 00:52:37,753
...now what?

581
00:52:39,932 --> 00:52:42,492
Now we wait for the Teacher's call.

582
00:52:54,947 --> 00:52:57,575
Good evening. I am Andre Vernet,
the night manager.

583
00:52:59,118 --> 00:53:02,349
I take it this is your first visit
to our establishment?

584
00:53:03,556 --> 00:53:04,523
Yes.

585
00:53:05,458 --> 00:53:06,755
Understood.

586
00:53:07,527 --> 00:53:09,893
Keys are often passed on
and first-time users...

587
00:53:10,096 --> 00:53:12,757
...are sometimes
uncertain of protocol.

588
00:53:14,533 --> 00:53:17,593
Keys are essentially
numbered Swiss accounts.

589
00:53:18,970 --> 00:53:21,495
Often willed through generations.

590
00:53:24,442 --> 00:53:26,876
Is it yours, mademoiselle?

591
00:53:29,014 --> 00:53:32,006
The shortest safety-deposit-box
lease is 50 years.

592
00:53:33,018 --> 00:53:35,077
And what's your longest account?

593
00:53:35,287 --> 00:53:36,845
Quite a bit longer.

594
00:53:37,322 --> 00:53:39,950
Technologies change,
keys are updated.

595
00:53:40,292 --> 00:53:44,251
But our accounts date back
to the beginning of banking itself.

596
00:53:49,201 --> 00:53:50,828
Once the computer
confirms your key...

597
00:53:51,036 --> 00:53:54,437
...enter your account number
and your box is retrieved.

598
00:53:54,873 --> 00:53:57,307
The room is yours,
as long as you like.

599
00:54:02,414 --> 00:54:05,611
What if I lost track
of my account number?

600
00:54:06,184 --> 00:54:07,651
How might I recover it?

601
00:54:09,921 --> 00:54:12,481
I'm afraid each key is paired
with a 10-digit number...

602
00:54:12,691 --> 00:54:14,716
...known only to the account bearer.

603
00:54:14,926 --> 00:54:16,985
I hope you manage to remember it.

604
00:54:17,629 --> 00:54:20,257
A single wrong entry
disables the system.

605
00:54:27,205 --> 00:54:28,229
- Ten.
- Ten.

606
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:30,965
Your grandfather's
Fibonacci sequence.

607
00:54:34,145 --> 00:54:36,511
Scrambled, unscrambled?

608
00:54:37,449 --> 00:54:38,746
Unscrambled.

609
00:54:39,451 --> 00:54:41,078
It's your key.

610
00:54:45,824 --> 00:54:49,521
Funny, I don't even like history.

611
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:57,158
I've never seen much good come
from looking to the past.

612
00:55:04,643 --> 00:55:06,133
Moment of truth.

613
00:55:50,789 --> 00:55:53,314
My God. I don't believe this.

614
00:55:53,758 --> 00:55:54,918
A rose.

615
00:55:59,764 --> 00:56:01,595
The rose was a symbol
for the Holy Grail.

616
00:56:04,469 --> 00:56:06,027
Forgive the intrusion.

617
00:56:06,237 --> 00:56:09,798
I'm afraid the police arrived
more quickly than I anticipated.

618
00:56:10,775 --> 00:56:12,538
You must follow me, please.

619
00:56:12,744 --> 00:56:14,109
For your own safety.

620
00:56:14,479 --> 00:56:16,071
You knew they were coming?

621
00:56:16,281 --> 00:56:19,010
My guard alerted me to your status
when you arrived.

622
00:56:19,216 --> 00:56:22,083
Yours is one of our oldest
and highest-level accounts.

623
00:56:22,286 --> 00:56:24,516
It includes a safe-passage clause.

624
00:56:24,722 --> 00:56:25,882
Safe passage?

625
00:56:26,790 --> 00:56:30,749
If you would step inside, please.
Time is of the essence.

626
00:56:33,163 --> 00:56:34,425
In there?

627
00:56:49,613 --> 00:56:51,376
Hey, is there a problem?

628
00:56:51,615 --> 00:56:54,209
Good evening, sir. Police.

629
00:56:54,685 --> 00:56:58,746
I just drive from here to Zurich.
Not French, English?

630
00:56:59,123 --> 00:57:00,249
- English?
- Yes.

631
00:57:01,692 --> 00:57:04,320
We are looking for two criminals.

632
00:57:05,529 --> 00:57:08,396
You came to the right place.
They're all criminals here.

633
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:12,532
Would you mind opening the hold?

634
00:57:13,070 --> 00:57:16,597
Please. You think they trust us,
the wages I get paid?

635
00:57:16,807 --> 00:57:18,672
You don't have keys
to your own truck?

636
00:57:18,876 --> 00:57:21,572
It's armored.
Keys get sent to the destination.

637
00:57:21,779 --> 00:57:23,838
You mind? I'm on a schedule here.

638
00:57:27,384 --> 00:57:31,787
And do all the drivers wear a Rolex?

639
00:57:32,289 --> 00:57:33,347
What?

640
00:57:35,793 --> 00:57:37,317
This piece of shit.

641
00:57:37,528 --> 00:57:39,291
Forty euros in Barbes.

642
00:57:39,496 --> 00:57:40,622
Yours for 35.

643
00:57:41,265 --> 00:57:42,232
No, no, no.

644
00:57:42,433 --> 00:57:44,196
- Thirty.
- No. It's okay, it's okay.

645
00:57:44,401 --> 00:57:45,629
Come on, 30, eh?

646
00:57:45,836 --> 00:57:47,167
I said, no!

647
00:57:47,738 --> 00:57:48,864
Move along!

648
00:58:02,319 --> 00:58:03,377
Now we wait.

649
00:58:03,587 --> 00:58:06,181
The Teacher will call and tell me
where to deliver the money.

650
00:58:06,390 --> 00:58:09,757
You have put tremendous faith
in this Teacher of yours.

651
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:14,363
Yes, I have. And I have given him
an angel to do his will.

652
00:58:14,731 --> 00:58:18,098
For surely there is no better
soldier for God than my Silas.

653
00:58:19,069 --> 00:58:22,732
I firmly resolve, with the help of
thy grace, to confess my sins...

654
00:58:36,987 --> 00:58:39,547
...to do penance
and to amend my life.

655
00:58:39,990 --> 00:58:40,957
Amen.

656
00:59:01,245 --> 00:59:03,611
I chastise my body.

657
00:59:19,663 --> 00:59:21,255
The Holy Grail.

658
00:59:22,065 --> 00:59:26,899
A magic cup.
The source of God's power on earth.

659
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:28,400
It's nonsense.

660
00:59:29,372 --> 00:59:31,306
You don't believe in God.

661
00:59:32,174 --> 00:59:33,300
No.

662
00:59:34,110 --> 00:59:39,571
I don't believe in some magic
from the sky.

663
00:59:39,782 --> 00:59:41,272
Just people.

664
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:44,511
Sometimes that they can be kind.

665
00:59:45,421 --> 00:59:46,649
And that's enough?

666
00:59:47,023 --> 00:59:50,356
Well, I think it has to be.
I think it's all we have.

667
00:59:52,962 --> 00:59:55,522
Are you a God-fearing man,
professor?

668
00:59:56,632 --> 00:59:58,429
I was raised a Catholic.

669
00:59:59,135 --> 01:00:01,695
Well, that's not really an answer.

670
01:00:03,573 --> 01:00:05,507
Professor, are you okay?

671
01:00:06,676 --> 01:00:08,268
Go ahead, open it.

672
01:00:09,078 --> 01:00:10,102
Go on.

673
01:00:17,219 --> 01:00:18,550
A cryptex.

674
01:00:19,889 --> 01:00:22,380
They are used to keep secrets.

675
01:00:23,159 --> 01:00:25,286
It's da Vinci's design.

676
01:00:25,928 --> 01:00:29,227
You write the information
on a papyrus scroll...

677
01:00:29,432 --> 01:00:34,529
...which is then rolled around
a thin glass vial of vinegar.

678
01:00:34,737 --> 01:00:37,934
If you force it open, the vial breaks...

679
01:00:38,140 --> 01:00:40,802
...vinegar dissolves papyrus...

680
01:00:42,578 --> 01:00:45,138
...and your secret is lost forever.

681
01:00:45,548 --> 01:00:47,573
The only way
to access the information...

682
01:00:47,783 --> 01:00:50,149
...is to spell out the password...

683
01:00:50,353 --> 01:00:53,811
...with these five dials,
each with 26 letters.

684
01:00:54,724 --> 01:00:58,421
That's 12 million possibilities.

685
01:00:59,095 --> 01:01:02,690
I've never met a girl
who knew that much about a cryptex.

686
01:01:03,933 --> 01:01:06,197
Sauniere made one for me once.

687
01:01:14,143 --> 01:01:17,340
My grandfather gave me a wagon.

688
01:01:19,915 --> 01:01:22,179
This clearly is not the Holy Grail.

689
01:01:26,088 --> 01:01:27,248
Come on.

690
01:01:27,523 --> 01:01:28,990
Please, you're not all right.

691
01:01:32,361 --> 01:01:34,124
May I try something?

692
01:01:34,497 --> 01:01:36,397
I don't know why it works.

693
01:01:36,999 --> 01:01:40,628
My mother used to do it
when I was scared, I think.

694
01:01:40,936 --> 01:01:42,198
You think?

695
01:01:43,005 --> 01:01:44,097
Yes.

696
01:01:56,118 --> 01:01:57,949
Feeling better, Sophie?

697
01:02:09,799 --> 01:02:14,600
My parents died in a car crash
with my brother.

698
01:02:15,571 --> 01:02:16,902
I was 4.

699
01:02:18,774 --> 01:02:20,139
I'm sorry.

700
01:02:21,510 --> 01:02:23,444
It was many years ago.

701
01:02:39,094 --> 01:02:40,356
Better?

702
01:02:43,131 --> 01:02:44,098
Yeah.

703
01:02:44,899 --> 01:02:46,025
Okay.

704
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:14,754
Twenty years waiting
for someone to come for that box...

705
01:03:14,963 --> 01:03:17,488
...and now it's you two murderers.
Bring it to me.

706
01:03:18,299 --> 01:03:19,994
I don't know what
you're talking about.

707
01:03:21,202 --> 01:03:23,136
All right! Okay!

708
01:03:23,838 --> 01:03:24,827
Right now!

709
01:03:35,316 --> 01:03:36,283
Step back!

710
01:03:40,255 --> 01:03:42,689
No one will lose sleep
over a couple on a killing spree.

711
01:03:45,860 --> 01:03:47,384
Turn around.

712
01:03:48,596 --> 01:03:49,995
Turn around!

713
01:03:50,331 --> 01:03:52,026
You too, mademoiselle.

714
01:04:14,622 --> 01:04:16,112
Sophie!

715
01:04:16,591 --> 01:04:17,956
Get in the truck!

716
01:04:18,793 --> 01:04:20,124
I'll drive! Hurry!

717
01:04:58,299 --> 01:05:01,496
- Better?
- Always, if I got too nervous...

718
01:05:01,703 --> 01:05:04,797
...I had to put my head out
of the window not to be sick.

719
01:05:05,473 --> 01:05:08,169
Sauniere used to say
I was like a dog.

720
01:05:09,444 --> 01:05:13,778
A cute dog. You know, a little dog.

721
01:05:22,891 --> 01:05:26,383
What happened between you
and your grandfather, Sophie?

722
01:05:28,930 --> 01:05:32,798
I've jammed my shoulder,
I've been shot at, I'm bleeding.

723
01:05:33,001 --> 01:05:34,558
I need to know.

724
01:05:34,768 --> 01:05:38,226
You say he raised you,
but you two don't talk anymore.

725
01:05:38,438 --> 01:05:40,406
You call him by his last name.

726
01:05:40,674 --> 01:05:43,234
You say you hate history.

727
01:05:43,443 --> 01:05:45,707
Nobody hates history.
They hate their own histories.

728
01:05:45,913 --> 01:05:47,904
So now you're a psychologist too?

729
01:05:48,282 --> 01:05:52,480
What if Sauniere had started
to groom you for the Priory?

730
01:05:52,686 --> 01:05:54,415
What do you mean, groom me?

731
01:05:54,621 --> 01:05:57,920
Your grandfather gave you puzzles
and cryptex as a child.

732
01:05:58,725 --> 01:06:02,957
Say Sauniere was hoping one day
you would join him in the Priory.

733
01:06:03,163 --> 01:06:05,256
Still, years later,
when he imagines...

734
01:06:06,099 --> 01:06:08,897
...the Grail is in danger,
he reaches out to you.

735
01:06:09,102 --> 01:06:13,129
So you are saying all this is real?
The Priory, the Holy Grail?

736
01:06:13,340 --> 01:06:16,468
We've been dragged into a world
of people who think this stuff is real.

737
01:06:16,677 --> 01:06:18,770
- Real enough to kill for.
- Who?

738
01:06:25,018 --> 01:06:27,543
I'm out of my field here.

739
01:06:29,990 --> 01:06:34,654
I do know a Grail historian,
absolutely obsessed with Priory myth.

740
01:06:34,861 --> 01:06:37,989
An Englishman,
lives here in France.

741
01:06:38,332 --> 01:06:39,924
Do you trust this man?

742
01:06:41,068 --> 01:06:42,592
I hope you can.

743
01:06:48,709 --> 01:06:50,506
Vernet, Andre.

744
01:06:52,212 --> 01:06:55,010
It seems you're not a driver at all.

745
01:06:56,883 --> 01:07:01,650
Apparently, you lost your tongue
along with your truck.

746
01:07:04,891 --> 01:07:09,055
Aiding and abetting
two murder suspects.

747
01:07:09,262 --> 01:07:11,696
That carries jail time.

748
01:07:12,232 --> 01:07:13,995
Speak to my lawyer.

749
01:07:15,669 --> 01:07:22,598
All this confusion, violence,
vanishing property...

750
01:07:22,809 --> 01:07:29,044
It might get around that your bank is
less than ideal, don't you think?

751
01:07:31,184 --> 01:07:33,846
You think you're in pain now,
Andre Vernet?

752
01:07:34,287 --> 01:07:38,246
My cause is worth your life.
Understand?

753
01:07:42,629 --> 01:07:44,187
What do you want?

754
01:07:44,531 --> 01:07:49,764
Your truck carries a homing device.
Activate it.

755
01:07:57,711 --> 01:08:00,407
Please wait.
I'll see if he's available.

756
01:08:00,614 --> 01:08:02,241
It's on the wrong side.

757
01:08:02,449 --> 01:08:04,940
Leigh likes all things to be English,
including his cars.

758
01:08:05,152 --> 01:08:08,280
Robert! Do I owe you money?

759
01:08:09,156 --> 01:08:11,954
Leigh, my friend...

760
01:08:12,225 --> 01:08:15,490
...care to open up
for an old colleague?

761
01:08:15,695 --> 01:08:17,424
- Of course.
- Thank you.

762
01:08:17,764 --> 01:08:20,164
But first, a test of honor.

763
01:08:20,767 --> 01:08:22,462
Three questions.

764
01:08:25,772 --> 01:08:26,966
Fire away.

765
01:08:27,174 --> 01:08:28,607
Your first:

766
01:08:28,809 --> 01:08:31,471
Shall I serve coffee or tea?

767
01:08:32,345 --> 01:08:33,710
Tea, of course.

768
01:08:33,914 --> 01:08:34,972
Excellent.

769
01:08:35,182 --> 01:08:37,480
Second: Milk or lemon?

770
01:08:38,518 --> 01:08:39,541
Milk?

771
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:43,252
That would depend on the tea.

772
01:08:43,456 --> 01:08:44,423
Correct.

773
01:08:45,424 --> 01:08:49,622
And now the third
and most grave of inquiries:

774
01:08:49,829 --> 01:08:55,131
In which year did a Harvard sculler
outrow an Oxford man at Henley?

775
01:09:02,675 --> 01:09:06,406
Surely such a travesty
has never occurred.

776
01:09:07,046 --> 01:09:08,911
Your heart is true.

777
01:09:09,782 --> 01:09:11,147
You may pass.

778
01:09:12,985 --> 01:09:15,317
Welcome to Chateau Villette.

779
01:09:19,892 --> 01:09:22,884
Leigh Teabing has spent
his entire life...

780
01:09:23,095 --> 01:09:25,928
...studying the Grail.
That thing is one hot tamale.

781
01:09:26,132 --> 01:09:27,531
Sorry?

782
01:09:27,733 --> 01:09:30,793
The cryptex, it's a hot coal.

783
01:09:32,805 --> 01:09:33,999
A hot potato?

784
01:09:35,708 --> 01:09:39,838
So you want to keep our chest
close to our cards, yes?

785
01:09:41,514 --> 01:09:43,379
Very close.

786
01:10:04,603 --> 01:10:07,197
The truck's signal is coming online.

787
01:10:07,439 --> 01:10:08,838
It's about time.

788
01:10:12,611 --> 01:10:14,203
Locked on and tracking, sir.

789
01:10:17,283 --> 01:10:20,446
Very good. Tell Collet not to move in
until I get there.

790
01:10:21,020 --> 01:10:25,514
Attention! All of Collet's units
to Chateau Villette.

791
01:10:26,458 --> 01:10:29,757
The suspects Neveu and Langdon
are likely at that location.

792
01:10:46,278 --> 01:10:47,609
Aringarosa.

793
01:10:58,557 --> 01:11:01,583
I still don't know why
he put you into this...

794
01:11:02,294 --> 01:11:04,194
...and I'm sorry.

795
01:11:09,301 --> 01:11:10,495
But...

796
01:11:11,303 --> 01:11:13,134
...I'm also very glad.

797
01:11:31,390 --> 01:11:34,052
You are requested
to make yourself at home.

798
01:11:42,368 --> 01:11:43,528
Robert!

799
01:11:44,636 --> 01:11:47,196
And you travel with a maiden,
it seems.

800
01:11:47,405 --> 01:11:50,636
Sir Leigh Teabing,
may I present Miss Sophie Neveu.

801
01:11:50,842 --> 01:11:52,969
Sophie, Sir Leigh Teabing.

802
01:11:53,177 --> 01:11:56,977
It's an honor to welcome you...

803
01:11:57,615 --> 01:11:59,674
...even though it's late.

804
01:11:59,984 --> 01:12:03,818
Thank you for having us.
I realize it's quite late.

805
01:12:05,089 --> 01:12:08,081
So late, mademoiselle,
it's almost early.

806
01:12:10,728 --> 01:12:12,355
What a lovely smile you have.

807
01:12:14,465 --> 01:12:15,432
Earl Grey?

808
01:12:16,401 --> 01:12:17,459
Lemon.

809
01:12:18,202 --> 01:12:19,328
Correct.

810
01:12:40,058 --> 01:12:42,253
Chateau Villette. Yes.

811
01:12:48,399 --> 01:12:50,094
- No.
- Oh, you must.

812
01:12:50,301 --> 01:12:53,031
Remy is from Lyons,
but nevertheless...

813
01:12:53,237 --> 01:12:54,704
...he is fantastic with sauces.

814
01:12:54,906 --> 01:12:57,101
- Thank you.
- No, I can't.

815
01:13:01,946 --> 01:13:04,005
A dramatic late-night arrival.

816
01:13:05,383 --> 01:13:07,783
Mention of life and death.

817
01:13:08,820 --> 01:13:11,448
What can an old cripple
do for you, Robert?

818
01:13:12,423 --> 01:13:16,120
We wanna talk about
the Priory of Sion.

819
01:13:16,561 --> 01:13:17,789
The keepers?

820
01:13:18,730 --> 01:13:20,061
The secret war?

821
01:13:20,264 --> 01:13:22,255
Sorry for all the mystery.

822
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,992
Leigh, I'm into something here
that I cannot understand.

823
01:13:26,437 --> 01:13:27,529
You?

824
01:13:28,373 --> 01:13:31,740
- Really?
- Not without your help.

825
01:13:32,176 --> 01:13:35,236
Playing to my vanity, Robert.
You should be ashamed.

826
01:13:35,446 --> 01:13:36,640
Not if it works.

827
01:13:39,250 --> 01:13:41,411
There are always four:

828
01:13:42,220 --> 01:13:45,348
The Grand Master
and the three senechaux...

829
01:13:45,556 --> 01:13:48,957
...make up the primary
guardians of the Grail.

830
01:13:50,895 --> 01:13:52,658
Thank you, Remy.
That'll be all for now.

831
01:13:59,437 --> 01:14:02,770
The Priory's members
span our very globe itself.

832
01:14:02,974 --> 01:14:07,411
Philippe de Cherisey
exposed that as a hoax in 1967.

833
01:14:07,612 --> 01:14:09,546
And that is what
they want you to believe.

834
01:14:10,481 --> 01:14:13,279
The Priory is charged
with a single task:

835
01:14:13,484 --> 01:14:16,817
To protect the greatest secret
in modern history.

836
01:14:17,021 --> 01:14:19,512
The source of God's power
on earth.

837
01:14:19,724 --> 01:14:21,316
No, that's a common
misunderstanding.

838
01:14:21,526 --> 01:14:26,463
The Priory protects the source
of the Church's power on earth:

839
01:14:27,165 --> 01:14:28,462
The Holy Grail.

840
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:30,627
I don't understand.

841
01:14:30,835 --> 01:14:34,965
What power? Some magic dishes?

842
01:14:35,706 --> 01:14:39,802
Robert. Has he been telling you
that the Holy Grail is a cup?

843
01:14:42,447 --> 01:14:44,210
To understand the Holy Grail,
my dear...

844
01:14:44,415 --> 01:14:47,714
...you must first understand
the Holy Bible.

845
01:15:03,633 --> 01:15:07,467
The Good Book did not arrive
by facsimile from heaven.

846
01:15:08,205 --> 01:15:12,699
The Bible as we know it
was finally presided over by one man:

847
01:15:12,909 --> 01:15:14,638
The pagan emperor Constantine.

848
01:15:15,078 --> 01:15:17,205
I thought Constantine
was a Christian.

849
01:15:17,414 --> 01:15:20,349
Oh, hardly, no.
He was a lifelong pagan...

850
01:15:20,550 --> 01:15:23,178
...who was baptized
on his deathbed.

851
01:15:23,386 --> 01:15:26,719
Constantine was Rome's
supreme holy man.

852
01:15:27,057 --> 01:15:28,547
From time immemorial...

853
01:15:28,758 --> 01:15:33,218
...his people had worshiped a balance
between nature's male deities...

854
01:15:33,430 --> 01:15:36,922
...and the goddess,
or sacred feminine.

855
01:15:37,734 --> 01:15:41,261
But a growing religious turmoil
was gripping Rome.

856
01:15:41,938 --> 01:15:43,803
Three centuries earlier...

857
01:15:44,007 --> 01:15:46,976
...a young Jew named Jesus
had come along...

858
01:15:47,177 --> 01:15:49,475
...preaching love and a single God.

859
01:15:49,679 --> 01:15:52,807
Centuries after his crucifixion...

860
01:15:53,283 --> 01:15:56,047
...Christ's followers
had grown exponentially...

861
01:15:56,253 --> 01:15:58,813
...and had started a religious war
against the pagans.

862
01:16:03,894 --> 01:16:07,295
Or did the pagans commence war
against the Christians?

863
01:16:07,964 --> 01:16:11,195
Leigh, we can't be sure who began
the atrocities in that period.

864
01:16:11,401 --> 01:16:14,336
We can at least agree that the
conflict grew to such proportions...

865
01:16:14,538 --> 01:16:17,098
...that it threatened
to tear Rome in two.

866
01:16:17,307 --> 01:16:20,572
So Constantine may have been
a lifelong pagan...

867
01:16:20,777 --> 01:16:22,608
...but he was also a pragmatist.

868
01:16:22,812 --> 01:16:24,939
And in 325 anno Domini...

869
01:16:25,148 --> 01:16:30,211
...he decided to unify Rome under
a single religion, Christianity.

870
01:16:30,420 --> 01:16:34,618
Christianity was on the rise.
He didn't want his empire torn apart.

871
01:16:34,824 --> 01:16:38,055
And to strengthen this new
Christian tradition...

872
01:16:38,261 --> 01:16:40,525
...Constantine held
a famous ecumenical gathering...

873
01:16:40,730 --> 01:16:43,563
...known as the Council of Nicaea.

874
01:16:43,767 --> 01:16:45,234
And at this council...

875
01:16:45,435 --> 01:16:50,338
...the many sects of Christianity
debated and voted on, well...

876
01:16:50,540 --> 01:16:54,442
...everything, from the acceptance
and rejection of specific gospels...

877
01:16:54,644 --> 01:16:56,168
...to the date for Easter...

878
01:16:56,379 --> 01:16:59,439
...to the administering
of the sacraments, and of course...

879
01:16:59,649 --> 01:17:01,617
...the immortality of Jesus.

880
01:17:02,185 --> 01:17:03,413
I don't follow.

881
01:17:03,853 --> 01:17:06,447
Well, ma chere,
until that moment in history...

882
01:17:07,057 --> 01:17:11,653
...Jesus was viewed by many of his
followers as a mighty prophet...

883
01:17:11,861 --> 01:17:15,695
...as a great and powerful man,
but a man nevertheless.

884
01:17:16,900 --> 01:17:18,731
A mortal man.

885
01:17:19,135 --> 01:17:22,229
Some Christians held
that Jesus was mortal.

886
01:17:22,439 --> 01:17:25,169
Some Christians believed
he was divine.

887
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:26,637
Not the Son of God?

888
01:17:26,843 --> 01:17:29,243
Not even his nephew twice removed.

889
01:17:29,446 --> 01:17:33,314
Hold on, you're saying
Jesus' divinity came from a vote.

890
01:17:33,683 --> 01:17:36,550
Well, remember, in those days,
gods were everywhere.

891
01:17:36,953 --> 01:17:41,117
By infusing Jesus the man
with the divine magic...

892
01:17:41,324 --> 01:17:44,816
...by making him capable
of earthly miracles...

893
01:17:45,028 --> 01:17:49,124
...as well as his own resurrection,
Constantine turned him into a god...

894
01:17:49,332 --> 01:17:51,527
...but within the human world.

895
01:17:51,735 --> 01:17:55,101
And he basically knocked the more
distant gods out of the game.

896
01:17:55,304 --> 01:17:58,762
Constantine did not create
Jesus' divinity.

897
01:17:58,974 --> 01:18:02,933
He simply sanctioned
an already widely held idea.

898
01:18:03,145 --> 01:18:04,772
- Semantics.
- No, it's not semantics.

899
01:18:04,980 --> 01:18:07,972
You're interpreting facts
to support your own conclusions.

900
01:18:08,183 --> 01:18:12,950
Fact: For many Christians, Jesus was
mortal one day and divine the next.

901
01:18:13,155 --> 01:18:15,180
For some Christians,
his divinity was enhanced.

902
01:18:15,391 --> 01:18:17,859
Absurd. There was a formal
announcement of his promotion.

903
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:20,028
They couldn't even agree
on the Nicene Creed!

904
01:18:20,229 --> 01:18:23,630
Excuse me.
"Who is God, who is man?"

905
01:18:28,003 --> 01:18:30,870
How many have been murdered
over this question?

906
01:18:31,707 --> 01:18:34,642
As long as there has been
a one true God...

907
01:18:34,843 --> 01:18:37,004
...there has been killing
in his name.

908
01:18:45,587 --> 01:18:48,181
Now let me show you the Grail.

909
01:18:56,365 --> 01:18:59,425
This used to be the ballroom.

910
01:18:59,635 --> 01:19:01,694
I have little occasion to dance
these days.

911
01:19:02,304 --> 01:19:04,966
I trust you recognize
The Last Supper...

912
01:19:05,541 --> 01:19:09,534
...the great fresco by
Leonardo da Vinci.

913
01:19:11,914 --> 01:19:14,542
Now, my dear,
if you would close your eyes.

914
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:16,980
Oh, Leigh, save us the parlor tricks.

915
01:19:17,186 --> 01:19:19,518
You asked for my help, I recall.

916
01:19:19,722 --> 01:19:22,350
Allow an old man his indulgences.

917
01:19:26,662 --> 01:19:30,063
Now, mademoiselle,
where is Jesus sitting?

918
01:19:30,666 --> 01:19:32,361
- In the middle.
- Good.

919
01:19:32,568 --> 01:19:35,401
He and his disciples
are breaking bread.

920
01:19:35,604 --> 01:19:38,004
And what drink?

921
01:19:38,373 --> 01:19:40,238
Wine. They drank wine.

922
01:19:40,442 --> 01:19:42,740
Splendid. And one final question:

923
01:19:42,945 --> 01:19:45,971
How many wineglasses
are there on the table?

924
01:19:47,349 --> 01:19:49,283
One? The Holy Grail?

925
01:19:49,485 --> 01:19:50,452
Open your eyes.

926
01:19:53,422 --> 01:19:55,049
No single cup.

927
01:19:55,624 --> 01:19:56,852
No chalice.

928
01:19:57,059 --> 01:19:59,789
Well, that's a bit strange, isn't it?

929
01:19:59,995 --> 01:20:03,123
Considering both the Bible
and standard Grail legend...

930
01:20:03,332 --> 01:20:07,598
...celebrate this moment as the
definitive arrival of the Holy Grail.

931
01:20:10,372 --> 01:20:12,897
Now, Robert,
you could be of help to us.

932
01:20:13,108 --> 01:20:17,010
If you'd be so kind as to show us the
symbols for man and woman, please.

933
01:20:17,212 --> 01:20:20,909
No balloon animals.
I can make a great duck.

934
01:20:23,952 --> 01:20:28,082
This is the original icon for male.
It's a rudimentary phallus.

935
01:20:28,290 --> 01:20:30,417
- Quite to the point.
- Yes, indeed.

936
01:20:30,626 --> 01:20:32,685
This is known as the blade.

937
01:20:32,895 --> 01:20:34,760
It represents aggression
and manhood.

938
01:20:34,963 --> 01:20:37,727
It's a symbol still used today
in modern military uniforms.

939
01:20:37,933 --> 01:20:41,960
Yes, the more penises you have, the
higher your rank. Boys will be boys.

940
01:20:42,171 --> 01:20:46,471
Now, as you would imagine, the
female symbol is its exact opposite.

941
01:20:46,675 --> 01:20:48,108
This is called the chalice.

942
01:20:48,310 --> 01:20:53,111
And the chalice resembles a cup
or vessel or, more importantly...

943
01:20:53,315 --> 01:20:55,476
...the shape of a woman's womb.

944
01:20:56,685 --> 01:20:59,653
No, the Grail has never been a cup.

945
01:20:59,854 --> 01:21:04,814
It is quite literally this ancient
symbol of womanhood.

946
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:11,091
And in this case, a woman who
carried a secret so powerful...

947
01:21:11,299 --> 01:21:15,599
...that if revealed, it would devastate
the very foundations of Christianity.

948
01:21:15,803 --> 01:21:17,065
Wait, please.

949
01:21:17,271 --> 01:21:21,833
You're saying the Holy Grail
is a person? A woman?

950
01:21:22,643 --> 01:21:26,602
And it turns out, she makes
an appearance right there.

951
01:21:27,215 --> 01:21:28,842
But they are all men.

952
01:21:29,050 --> 01:21:30,142
Are they?

953
01:21:30,384 --> 01:21:32,784
What about that figure
on the right hand of our Lord...

954
01:21:32,987 --> 01:21:35,683
...seated in the place of honor?

955
01:21:36,524 --> 01:21:38,355
Flowing red hair.

956
01:21:39,493 --> 01:21:41,757
Folded feminine hands.

957
01:21:42,964 --> 01:21:45,364
Hint of a bosom. No?

958
01:21:50,872 --> 01:21:54,239
It's called scotoma.
The mind sees what it chooses to see.

959
01:21:54,575 --> 01:21:55,940
Who is she?

960
01:21:57,245 --> 01:21:59,110
My dear, that's Mary Magdalene.

961
01:21:59,513 --> 01:22:00,537
The prostitute?

962
01:22:01,515 --> 01:22:02,982
She was no such thing.

963
01:22:03,384 --> 01:22:07,980
Smeared by the Church
in 591 anno Domini, poor dear.

964
01:22:10,424 --> 01:22:13,222
Mary Magdalene was Jesus' wife.

965
01:22:20,268 --> 01:22:22,236
This is an old wives' tale.

966
01:22:22,436 --> 01:22:23,869
The original one, in fact.

967
01:22:24,071 --> 01:22:26,164
There's virtually no empirical proof.

968
01:22:26,374 --> 01:22:29,571
He knows as well as I do
there's much evidence to support it.

969
01:22:29,777 --> 01:22:31,438
Theories. There are theories.

970
01:22:31,646 --> 01:22:34,774
Notice how Jesus and Mary
are clothed.

971
01:22:36,217 --> 01:22:38,242
Mirror images of each other.

972
01:22:38,452 --> 01:22:40,920
The mind sees
what it chooses to see.

973
01:22:41,122 --> 01:22:45,559
And venturing into the even more
bizarre, notice how Jesus and Mary...

974
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:49,252
...appear to be joined at the hip and
are leaning away from each other...

975
01:22:49,463 --> 01:22:54,025
...as if to create a shape in the
negative space between them.

976
01:22:55,036 --> 01:22:58,369
Leonardo gives us the chalice.

977
01:23:00,908 --> 01:23:03,468
Yes. Oh, and Robert,
notice what happens...

978
01:23:03,678 --> 01:23:06,841
...when these two figures
change position.

979
01:23:07,715 --> 01:23:10,980
Just because da Vinci painted it
doesn't make it true.

980
01:23:11,185 --> 01:23:13,085
No. But history...

981
01:23:13,487 --> 01:23:15,284
...she does make it true.

982
01:23:15,489 --> 01:23:18,720
Now, listen to this. It's from
the Gospel according to Philip.

983
01:23:18,926 --> 01:23:19,893
Philip?

984
01:23:20,094 --> 01:23:22,961
Yes, it was rejected
at the Council of Nicaea...

985
01:23:23,164 --> 01:23:25,155
...along with any other gospels
that made...

986
01:23:25,366 --> 01:23:27,857
...Jesus appear human
and not divine.

987
01:23:28,069 --> 01:23:32,972
"And the companion of the Savior
is Mary Magdalene.

988
01:23:33,341 --> 01:23:37,072
Christ loved her more
than all the disciples...

989
01:23:37,278 --> 01:23:39,143
...and used to kiss her on the..."

990
01:23:39,347 --> 01:23:41,178
But this says nothing of marriage.

991
01:23:41,382 --> 01:23:44,146
Well, actually...

992
01:23:44,352 --> 01:23:45,319
Robert.

993
01:23:45,953 --> 01:23:50,583
Actually, in those days, the word
"companion" literally meant "spouse."

994
01:23:50,791 --> 01:23:55,228
And this is from the Gospel
of Mary Magdalene herself.

995
01:23:55,429 --> 01:23:58,091
- She wrote a gospel?
- She may have.

996
01:23:58,299 --> 01:24:01,234
- Robert, will you fight fair?
- She may have.

997
01:24:01,435 --> 01:24:05,393
"And Peter said,
'Did he prefer her to us?'

998
01:24:06,373 --> 01:24:07,635
And Levi answered:

999
01:24:07,841 --> 01:24:11,937
'Peter, I see you contending
against a woman like an adversary.

1000
01:24:12,145 --> 01:24:16,605
If the Savior made her worthy,
who are you, indeed, to reject her?'"

1001
01:24:16,816 --> 01:24:21,276
Yes. And then, my dear, Jesus
goes on to tell Mary Magdalene...

1002
01:24:21,488 --> 01:24:25,322
...that it's up to her
to continue his Church.

1003
01:24:26,426 --> 01:24:29,122
Mary Magdalene, not Peter.

1004
01:24:29,929 --> 01:24:33,729
The Church was supposed
to be carried on by a woman.

1005
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:38,899
Few realize that Mary was descended
from kings, just as her husband was.

1006
01:24:39,506 --> 01:24:44,705
Now, my dear, the word
in French for Holy Grail.

1007
01:24:46,179 --> 01:24:49,307
From the Middle English
"Sangreal"...

1008
01:24:49,516 --> 01:24:52,076
...of the original Arthurian legend.

1009
01:24:52,285 --> 01:24:57,416
Now, as two words.
Can you translate for our friend?

1010
01:24:59,125 --> 01:25:02,583
Sang real, it means "royal blood."

1011
01:25:03,329 --> 01:25:07,527
When the legend speaks of the
chalice that held the blood of Christ...

1012
01:25:08,101 --> 01:25:13,403
...it speaks in fact of the female womb
that carried Jesus' royal bloodline.

1013
01:25:14,407 --> 01:25:17,240
But how could Christ
have a bloodline, unless...?

1014
01:25:17,444 --> 01:25:20,277
Mary was pregnant
at the time of the Crucifixion.

1015
01:25:28,855 --> 01:25:33,189
For her own safety and for that
of Christ's unborn child...

1016
01:25:33,393 --> 01:25:36,453
...she fled the Holy Land
and came to France.

1017
01:25:36,663 --> 01:25:41,760
And here, it is said,
she gave birth to a daughter, Sarah.

1018
01:25:42,936 --> 01:25:45,302
They know the child's name.

1019
01:25:46,272 --> 01:25:48,137
- A little girl.
- Yes.

1020
01:25:48,341 --> 01:25:50,434
If that were true,
it's adding insult to injury.

1021
01:25:50,643 --> 01:25:51,701
Why?

1022
01:25:51,911 --> 01:25:55,540
The pagans found transcendence
through the joining of male to female.

1023
01:25:55,748 --> 01:25:57,443
People found God through sex?

1024
01:25:57,650 --> 01:26:00,483
In paganism, women were worshiped
as a route to heaven...

1025
01:26:00,687 --> 01:26:03,520
...but the modern Church
has a monopoly on that...

1026
01:26:03,723 --> 01:26:05,953
...in salvation through Jesus Christ.

1027
01:26:06,159 --> 01:26:08,889
And he who keeps the keys to heaven
rules the world.

1028
01:26:09,095 --> 01:26:12,258
Women, then, are a huge threat
to the Church.

1029
01:26:12,465 --> 01:26:14,296
The Catholic Inquisition
soon publishes...

1030
01:26:14,501 --> 01:26:17,800
...what may be the most
blood-soaked book in human history.

1031
01:26:18,065 --> 01:26:20,465
The Malleus Maleficarum.

1032
01:26:21,569 --> 01:26:23,196
The Witches' Hammer.

1033
01:26:23,537 --> 01:26:27,268
It instructed the clergy on how
to locate, torture and kill...

1034
01:26:27,474 --> 01:26:29,704
...all freethinking women.

1035
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:35,075
In three centuries of witch hunts...

1036
01:26:35,516 --> 01:26:39,213
...50,000 women are captured,
burned alive at the stake.

1037
01:26:39,420 --> 01:26:42,048
Oh, at least that.
Some say millions.

1038
01:26:42,656 --> 01:26:44,351
Imagine, then, Robert...

1039
01:26:44,858 --> 01:26:48,726
...that Christ's throne
might live on in a female child.

1040
01:26:49,730 --> 01:26:52,722
You asked what would
be worth killing for.

1041
01:26:53,334 --> 01:26:56,895
Witness the greatest cover-up
in human history.

1042
01:26:57,705 --> 01:26:59,935
This is the secret
that the Priory of Sion...

1043
01:27:00,140 --> 01:27:02,540
...has defended
for over 20 centuries.

1044
01:27:02,743 --> 01:27:05,906
They are the guardians
of the royal bloodline.

1045
01:27:06,447 --> 01:27:09,905
The keepers of the proof
of our true past.

1046
01:27:10,117 --> 01:27:14,576
They are the protectors of the living
descendants of Jesus Christ...

1047
01:27:16,256 --> 01:27:17,985
...and Mary Magdalene.

1048
01:27:27,767 --> 01:27:28,995
Sir Leigh?

1049
01:27:29,802 --> 01:27:33,101
Sometimes I wonder
who is serving whom.

1050
01:27:33,806 --> 01:27:36,832
His sauces are not that fantastic.

1051
01:27:39,245 --> 01:27:40,712
Yes, can I help you?

1052
01:27:40,913 --> 01:27:42,938
Yes. They're on the news now.

1053
01:27:45,985 --> 01:27:49,284
Living descendants? Is it possible?

1054
01:27:49,489 --> 01:27:51,116
It's not impossible.

1055
01:27:52,392 --> 01:27:55,919
You have not been honest with me.
Your pictures are on the television.

1056
01:27:56,129 --> 01:27:58,029
You are wanted for four murders!

1057
01:27:58,464 --> 01:28:00,728
That's why Vernet said
"killing spree."

1058
01:28:00,933 --> 01:28:04,369
You come into my home,
playing on my passions for the Grail.

1059
01:28:04,570 --> 01:28:07,038
- That's why he needed you.
- You will leave my house!

1060
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:09,231
- Leigh, listen!
- No, I'm calling the police.

1061
01:28:09,442 --> 01:28:11,774
Jacques Sauniere
was her grandfather.

1062
01:28:14,647 --> 01:28:16,274
You're the obsessive Priory scholar.

1063
01:28:16,482 --> 01:28:18,712
You still keep lists
of who might be in the Priory?

1064
01:28:19,919 --> 01:28:22,752
I'll bet Jacques Sauniere
was on one of those lists.

1065
01:28:24,691 --> 01:28:27,182
He was on your list of who could
be Grand Master, wasn't he?

1066
01:28:27,527 --> 01:28:30,087
- What?
- I'll bet he was right at the top.

1067
01:28:30,296 --> 01:28:35,461
Consider: Four men murdered?
The same number as the guardians.

1068
01:28:35,668 --> 01:28:38,933
What if the Priory was compromised,
the other senechaux dead?

1069
01:28:39,138 --> 01:28:41,231
What if you yourself were dying,
a Grand Master?

1070
01:28:41,874 --> 01:28:45,332
You'd have to pass the secret on
to someone you could trust.

1071
01:28:45,545 --> 01:28:47,240
Someone outside the society.

1072
01:28:47,447 --> 01:28:52,680
Maybe someone whose training
you had begun but never finished.

1073
01:28:55,021 --> 01:28:57,512
Robert, your ruse is pathetic.

1074
01:28:58,658 --> 01:29:00,023
Not really.

1075
01:29:01,594 --> 01:29:03,824
No, that's impossible.

1076
01:29:06,966 --> 01:29:08,593
Can that really...?

1077
01:29:11,003 --> 01:29:12,300
Is it the keystone?

1078
01:29:15,675 --> 01:29:18,007
I'll even show it to you, Leigh.

1079
01:29:18,378 --> 01:29:20,539
Will you just tell us
what the hell it's for?

1080
01:29:38,498 --> 01:29:40,159
Fache says to wait, so I wait.

1081
01:29:40,433 --> 01:29:44,494
What's Fache thinking?
The truck is here. They're inside.

1082
01:29:53,279 --> 01:29:54,405
Yes.

1083
01:29:54,614 --> 01:29:57,412
As the legend foretold:

1084
01:29:59,218 --> 01:30:01,379
"It hides beneath the Rose."

1085
01:30:01,587 --> 01:30:03,179
Oh, my.

1086
01:30:10,096 --> 01:30:11,563
Leigh.

1087
01:30:14,967 --> 01:30:16,433
Leigh?

1088
01:30:17,402 --> 01:30:18,369
Please.

1089
01:30:18,570 --> 01:30:20,561
I'm sorry. Yes, of course.

1090
01:30:22,974 --> 01:30:24,999
Inside the keystone...

1091
01:30:26,378 --> 01:30:27,868
...there'll be a map.

1092
01:30:28,079 --> 01:30:30,877
A map that will lead us
to the Holy Grail.

1093
01:30:34,820 --> 01:30:37,755
To be trained by
the Grand Master himself.

1094
01:30:38,223 --> 01:30:42,057
Did he pass down the fleur-de-lis?
Is that how you found this?

1095
01:30:44,596 --> 01:30:47,463
And he must have sung you
the riddle songs.

1096
01:30:47,666 --> 01:30:49,190
I know some of them.

1097
01:30:58,477 --> 01:31:00,308
Can you keep secrets?

1098
01:31:01,913 --> 01:31:04,780
Can you know a thing
and never say it again?

1099
01:31:05,851 --> 01:31:06,909
And codes?

1100
01:31:08,186 --> 01:31:12,179
I imagine they lie down
for you like lovers.

1101
01:31:15,193 --> 01:31:20,096
A senechal. A guardian of the Grail
right here in my own home.

1102
01:31:20,298 --> 01:31:23,165
Tell him, please.
I don't know any of this.

1103
01:31:23,368 --> 01:31:26,235
Leigh, it's not that simple.
She doesn't rem...

1104
01:31:27,806 --> 01:31:29,034
Robert!

1105
01:31:34,379 --> 01:31:35,744
Do not move, woman.

1106
01:31:40,085 --> 01:31:41,052
Cripple.

1107
01:31:43,388 --> 01:31:45,413
Put the box on the table.

1108
01:31:46,124 --> 01:31:47,853
What, this trifle?

1109
01:31:48,059 --> 01:31:52,018
Well, perhaps we can make
a financial arrangement.

1110
01:31:52,230 --> 01:31:55,256
Put the keystone on the table.

1111
01:31:56,234 --> 01:31:57,861
You will not succeed.

1112
01:32:00,171 --> 01:32:03,334
Only the worthy
can unlock the stone.

1113
01:32:32,737 --> 01:32:35,103
Rip the gate down.

1114
01:32:38,610 --> 01:32:40,305
Well, well, my dear.

1115
01:32:44,482 --> 01:32:45,813
Sit down.

1116
01:32:46,017 --> 01:32:47,416
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

1117
01:32:47,619 --> 01:32:49,746
- Are you?
- Yeah.

1118
01:32:49,955 --> 01:32:52,287
Yes, well, make yourself useful,
you French fool.

1119
01:32:52,490 --> 01:32:54,651
Get something
to restrain this monster.

1120
01:32:59,664 --> 01:33:01,256
Above the joint.

1121
01:33:02,133 --> 01:33:06,695
Fortunately,
a dragon most easy to slay.

1122
01:33:06,905 --> 01:33:08,304
He's wearing a cilice.

1123
01:33:09,107 --> 01:33:11,302
- A what?
- Well, look.

1124
01:33:13,812 --> 01:33:16,280
Inflicts pain so he can suffer
as Christ suffered.

1125
01:33:19,818 --> 01:33:22,547
Not so common these days.

1126
01:33:22,987 --> 01:33:24,887
Opus Dei.

1127
01:33:25,089 --> 01:33:27,557
Remy, take care of this.

1128
01:33:31,862 --> 01:33:33,352
Fache is Opus Dei.

1129
01:33:34,632 --> 01:33:37,601
The policeman who's chasing us.
He wears the cross in the world.

1130
01:33:37,801 --> 01:33:39,428
Robert.

1131
01:33:41,772 --> 01:33:45,037
Well, I must say,
you two are anything but dull.

1132
01:33:46,377 --> 01:33:47,344
Leigh?

1133
01:33:49,513 --> 01:33:51,447
You want what's in this box?

1134
01:33:52,583 --> 01:33:54,312
We need a way out of here.

1135
01:33:54,518 --> 01:33:56,509
Well, actually...

1136
01:33:57,621 --> 01:33:59,316
...I do have a plane.

1137
01:34:09,867 --> 01:34:11,698
- Robert! Where do we go?
- Come along.

1138
01:34:11,902 --> 01:34:13,733
- In here. Come in.
- Over here.

1139
01:34:13,937 --> 01:34:16,405
Get the door. Hurry.

1140
01:34:18,475 --> 01:34:20,375
Over here. Over here. Sophie.

1141
01:34:20,577 --> 01:34:21,839
Watch out!

1142
01:34:23,213 --> 01:34:24,805
Be careful.

1143
01:34:25,182 --> 01:34:26,877
Come, Rem...

1144
01:34:34,024 --> 01:34:35,355
Shit.

1145
01:34:38,395 --> 01:34:39,419
Easy.

1146
01:35:02,453 --> 01:35:03,420
Jesus!

1147
01:35:03,620 --> 01:35:04,587
Apropos.

1148
01:35:07,458 --> 01:35:09,323
I can't imagine
what your complaint is.

1149
01:35:09,526 --> 01:35:12,518
I'd be within my rights to shoot you
and let you rot in my woods!

1150
01:35:12,730 --> 01:35:15,096
Put that away. We might need him.

1151
01:35:15,733 --> 01:35:16,859
Better.

1152
01:35:23,841 --> 01:35:25,468
Opus Dei.

1153
01:35:26,443 --> 01:35:28,934
- What is it?
- A conservative Catholic sect.

1154
01:35:29,146 --> 01:35:31,011
Opus Dei is a prelature
to the Vatican.

1155
01:35:31,215 --> 01:35:34,548
You're saying the Vatican
is killing people for this box?

1156
01:35:34,752 --> 01:35:36,686
No, no, no. Not the Vatican...

1157
01:35:36,887 --> 01:35:39,378
...and not Opus Dei,
but we are in the middle of a war.

1158
01:35:39,590 --> 01:35:42,024
And one that has been
going on forever.

1159
01:35:42,226 --> 01:35:44,456
On the one side stands the Priory...

1160
01:35:44,661 --> 01:35:47,289
...and on the other
an ancient group of despots...

1161
01:35:47,498 --> 01:35:49,762
...with members hidden
in high-ranking positions...

1162
01:35:49,967 --> 01:35:51,730
...throughout the Church.

1163
01:35:51,935 --> 01:35:56,565
And this Council of Shadows tries
to destroy proof of the bloodline.

1164
01:35:56,774 --> 01:35:59,436
And that throughout history,
they seek out and kill...

1165
01:35:59,643 --> 01:36:01,577
...the living descendants
of Jesus Christ.

1166
01:36:01,779 --> 01:36:03,440
- That's insane.
- Is it?

1167
01:36:03,680 --> 01:36:06,240
How many atrocities and scandals
has the Catholic Church...

1168
01:36:06,450 --> 01:36:08,543
...rationalized in its time?
And what happens...

1169
01:36:08,752 --> 01:36:11,516
...if some persuasive scientific
evidence emerges that shows...

1170
01:36:11,722 --> 01:36:14,782
...that the Church's version of Christ
is inaccurate?

1171
01:36:16,493 --> 01:36:17,790
What if the world discovers...

1172
01:36:17,995 --> 01:36:20,725
...that the greatest story ever told
is actually a lie?

1173
01:36:20,931 --> 01:36:24,594
The Vatican faces a crisis of faith
unprecedented.

1174
01:36:25,335 --> 01:36:27,962
I've got a signal now, sir.
It's ringing.

1175
01:36:30,139 --> 01:36:34,872
Roger, look, I'm so sorry. I've got
tired of the weather here in France...

1176
01:36:35,278 --> 01:36:38,213
...and could you make
the plane ready for...

1177
01:36:40,149 --> 01:36:41,309
...Zurich.

1178
01:36:41,884 --> 01:36:43,351
Yes. No, we love Zurich.

1179
01:36:51,327 --> 01:36:53,852
What the hell do you mean,
you lost them? Collet.

1180
01:36:55,998 --> 01:36:57,431
You're the one who lost them.

1181
01:36:57,834 --> 01:36:59,324
You control every step
of this investigation.

1182
01:36:59,535 --> 01:37:01,935
You don't let anybody breathe.

1183
01:37:02,471 --> 01:37:05,133
You're acting like
you lost your mind.

1184
01:37:08,544 --> 01:37:11,377
What is it with these two birds?

1185
01:37:15,017 --> 01:37:17,850
Interpol just registered a new
flight plan from Le Bourget.

1186
01:37:18,754 --> 01:37:21,985
Stay out of my way on this, Collet.

1187
01:37:49,986 --> 01:37:51,851
Did you kill Jacques Sauniere?

1188
01:37:55,258 --> 01:37:57,283
Did you kill Jacques Sauniere?

1189
01:37:58,261 --> 01:38:00,058
I am the messenger of God.

1190
01:38:03,933 --> 01:38:06,094
Did you kill my grandfather?

1191
01:38:09,238 --> 01:38:10,899
I am the messenger...

1192
01:38:11,374 --> 01:38:15,401
Each breath you take is a sin.

1193
01:38:16,913 --> 01:38:19,313
No shadow will be safe again.

1194
01:38:19,515 --> 01:38:24,248
For you will be hunted by angels.

1195
01:38:25,688 --> 01:38:27,656
You believe in God?

1196
01:38:28,925 --> 01:38:31,416
Your God doesn't
forgive murderers.

1197
01:38:34,964 --> 01:38:36,795
He burns them.

1198
01:38:48,010 --> 01:38:48,999
Sophie.

1199
01:39:30,386 --> 01:39:31,943
The Teacher will be pleased.

1200
01:39:32,153 --> 01:39:34,348
What will you do
once you have the Grail?

1201
01:39:34,556 --> 01:39:35,818
Destroy it.

1202
01:39:36,024 --> 01:39:39,653
The documents and the
sarcophagus, of course.

1203
01:39:40,996 --> 01:39:42,395
And the heir?

1204
01:39:46,201 --> 01:39:49,659
Will you exercise the final edict?
Spill his blood?

1205
01:39:50,271 --> 01:39:51,738
There will be no need.

1206
01:39:51,940 --> 01:39:56,639
Once the sarcophagus is destroyed,
DNA testing will be impossible.

1207
01:39:56,845 --> 01:39:59,575
There is no way to prove
a living bloodline.

1208
01:40:00,281 --> 01:40:01,908
But if you had to...

1209
01:40:03,551 --> 01:40:06,577
...would you do as councils
have done before us?

1210
01:40:15,563 --> 01:40:16,860
Christ...

1211
01:40:21,803 --> 01:40:26,069
Christ sacrificed his life
for the betterment of humanity.

1212
01:40:29,511 --> 01:40:32,412
So, too, may be the fate of his seed.

1213
01:40:42,057 --> 01:40:43,547
Robert.

1214
01:40:43,758 --> 01:40:47,717
When we land, you must go
straight to your embassy.

1215
01:40:49,064 --> 01:40:50,531
Is that so?

1216
01:40:52,467 --> 01:40:54,560
Don't you see it?

1217
01:40:54,769 --> 01:40:56,498
They never wanted you.

1218
01:40:57,338 --> 01:41:00,034
Maybe even Fache didn't.

1219
01:41:00,241 --> 01:41:03,301
It's all about this...

1220
01:41:03,511 --> 01:41:05,172
...idiotic little box.

1221
01:41:09,984 --> 01:41:11,952
That's not too flattering.

1222
01:41:12,620 --> 01:41:14,952
Crazy old man.

1223
01:41:15,323 --> 01:41:17,553
Why leave me with this?

1224
01:41:17,959 --> 01:41:20,553
I should just throw it away.

1225
01:41:24,866 --> 01:41:26,629
He trusted you, Sophie.

1226
01:41:27,669 --> 01:41:31,002
A guardian of the Holy Grail.

1227
01:41:32,607 --> 01:41:34,973
It sounds so stupid.

1228
01:41:36,211 --> 01:41:40,580
It's quite an honor,
if you think about it...

1229
01:41:40,782 --> 01:41:42,079
...and take it seriously.

1230
01:41:42,517 --> 01:41:45,247
He took it seriously enough
to get himself killed.

1231
01:41:45,954 --> 01:41:48,047
Not him. You.

1232
01:41:50,959 --> 01:41:53,621
He was the only family I knew.

1233
01:41:54,129 --> 01:41:56,427
And maybe I didn't know him at all.

1234
01:41:58,032 --> 01:42:00,023
I'm his marionette, Robert.

1235
01:42:00,235 --> 01:42:03,329
Like a girl again,
just with no gift at the end.

1236
01:42:09,077 --> 01:42:10,977
But you've done enough.

1237
01:42:13,681 --> 01:42:18,345
I don't know why Sauniere
picked me to help you, Sophie.

1238
01:42:20,655 --> 01:42:24,022
But I won't leave you alone
in all this.

1239
01:42:30,331 --> 01:42:31,958
Two marionettes, then.

1240
01:42:35,803 --> 01:42:37,963
Maybe this is why he chose you.

1241
01:42:41,108 --> 01:42:43,440
Because you will stay.

1242
01:42:58,926 --> 01:43:00,689
I need the flight plan.

1243
01:43:01,028 --> 01:43:02,017
Ten minutes.

1244
01:43:03,030 --> 01:43:05,362
I asked you to get it for me.

1245
01:43:06,533 --> 01:43:08,433
I'm on break.

1246
01:43:09,903 --> 01:43:11,461
Come back in 10 minutes.

1247
01:43:13,507 --> 01:43:15,634
My nose! My nose!

1248
01:43:16,243 --> 01:43:17,642
The flight plan, please.

1249
01:43:17,844 --> 01:43:18,811
You asshole!

1250
01:43:32,092 --> 01:43:33,821
It's not "cross."

1251
01:43:35,062 --> 01:43:36,359
"Spear"?

1252
01:43:43,370 --> 01:43:44,894
What happened to her?

1253
01:43:45,672 --> 01:43:47,264
No one knows.

1254
01:43:47,708 --> 01:43:51,041
Mary Magdalene lived out
her days in hiding.

1255
01:43:52,713 --> 01:43:55,113
And the zealots pursued her still...

1256
01:43:55,716 --> 01:44:00,085
...even in death, trying to destroy
proof of her existence.

1257
01:44:01,088 --> 01:44:03,420
But she always had her Knights.

1258
01:44:03,624 --> 01:44:06,058
Brave men sworn to defend her.

1259
01:44:06,260 --> 01:44:08,820
You see, to worship
before her sarcophagus...

1260
01:44:09,329 --> 01:44:12,594
...to kneel before the bones
of Mary Magdalene...

1261
01:44:12,799 --> 01:44:15,962
...was to remember all those
who were robbed of their power...

1262
01:44:16,169 --> 01:44:17,158
...who were oppressed.

1263
01:44:17,571 --> 01:44:22,008
Ultimately, the Priory hid her remains
and the proof of her bloodline...

1264
01:44:22,209 --> 01:44:24,837
...until most believed
her sarcophagus...

1265
01:44:25,846 --> 01:44:27,507
...the Holy Grail...

1266
01:44:28,515 --> 01:44:31,484
...was finally lost in time.

1267
01:44:42,429 --> 01:44:43,418
What are you doing?

1268
01:44:43,630 --> 01:44:46,258
At the chateau, you said,
"It hides beneath the Rose."

1269
01:44:46,466 --> 01:44:47,831
No, no, no. Do be careful.

1270
01:44:48,035 --> 01:44:51,630
In Latin, sub rosa.
Literal translation...

1271
01:44:51,838 --> 01:44:53,430
"Beneath the rose."

1272
01:45:06,453 --> 01:45:07,920
We need a mirror.

1273
01:45:08,121 --> 01:45:10,954
Backwards. In the style
of Leonardo himself.

1274
01:45:11,158 --> 01:45:12,819
Thank you.

1275
01:45:17,164 --> 01:45:21,123
In London lies a knight
a Pope interred

1276
01:45:21,335 --> 01:45:25,032
His labor's fruit
a Holy wrath incurred

1277
01:45:25,439 --> 01:45:28,374
You seek the orb
that ought be on his tomb

1278
01:45:28,775 --> 01:45:32,404
It speaks of Rosy flesh
and seeded womb

1279
01:45:32,612 --> 01:45:36,548
"In London lies a knight
a Pope interred"?

1280
01:45:36,750 --> 01:45:40,550
A knight whose funeral
was presided over by the Pope.

1281
01:45:40,754 --> 01:45:43,950
Of course, the Priory knights
were not just any knights.

1282
01:45:44,156 --> 01:45:45,123
Templars.

1283
01:45:45,324 --> 01:45:48,418
And there's just one place to bury
a Templar knight in London.

1284
01:45:48,627 --> 01:45:49,719
Temple Church.

1285
01:45:49,929 --> 01:45:52,090
Temple Church.
If you'll excuse me, my dear...

1286
01:45:52,298 --> 01:45:55,131
...Roger and I must discuss
a change in flight plan.

1287
01:45:55,334 --> 01:45:56,699
Leigh.

1288
01:45:58,437 --> 01:46:00,837
Harboring and transporting
fugitives?

1289
01:46:01,607 --> 01:46:04,167
You are already implicated enough.

1290
01:46:05,378 --> 01:46:08,973
You and I, Robert,
have observed history.

1291
01:46:09,181 --> 01:46:11,411
Time has been our glass.

1292
01:46:11,984 --> 01:46:15,181
We are in history now. Living it.

1293
01:46:16,889 --> 01:46:18,516
Making it.

1294
01:46:19,225 --> 01:46:20,658
"Implicated"?

1295
01:46:20,893 --> 01:46:23,418
I am on a Grail quest.

1296
01:46:25,064 --> 01:46:26,554
Forgive me, Robert...

1297
01:46:26,766 --> 01:46:29,064
...but you two may well
have given this old man...

1298
01:46:29,268 --> 01:46:31,600
...the greatest night of his life.

1299
01:46:33,472 --> 01:46:34,598
Thank you.

1300
01:46:36,709 --> 01:46:38,836
He's going to want more money.

1301
01:46:55,961 --> 01:47:00,057
I suppose this is a new technique
for investigations.

1302
01:47:00,266 --> 01:47:05,363
I've lost them.
They flew to Switzerland.

1303
01:47:05,638 --> 01:47:07,833
No extradition.

1304
01:47:10,609 --> 01:47:16,878
The controller filed charges.
Ari was on dispatch. He called me.

1305
01:47:20,986 --> 01:47:24,046
What's going on, Bezu?

1306
01:47:27,092 --> 01:47:29,925
You know that I am Opus Dei?

1307
01:47:30,329 --> 01:47:31,853
Yes.

1308
01:47:37,169 --> 01:47:40,661
A bishop of my order called me.

1309
01:47:41,006 --> 01:47:43,099
He said a killer
came to him in confession.

1310
01:47:43,309 --> 01:47:46,039
His name was Robert Langdon.

1311
01:47:47,246 --> 01:47:50,340
He said I couldn't imagine
the evil in this mars heart.

1312
01:47:50,549 --> 01:47:53,245
That he would keep killing.

1313
01:47:53,652 --> 01:47:56,086
He said I had to stop him.

1314
01:47:58,157 --> 01:48:01,957
The bishop broke his vows
to tell me this.

1315
01:48:02,161 --> 01:48:05,562
He charged me
to stop Robert Langdon.

1316
01:48:08,534 --> 01:48:13,267
Tell me, Collet, who have I failed?

1317
01:48:14,106 --> 01:48:15,869
The bishop?

1318
01:48:17,209 --> 01:48:19,268
God himself?

1319
01:48:27,953 --> 01:48:31,013
They've changed their flight plan
to London.

1320
01:48:36,962 --> 01:48:41,399
Go on, Fache.
I'll take care of the controller.

1321
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:46,697
Maybe he needs a few extra euros.

1322
01:48:47,605 --> 01:48:51,336
Just tell me next time.

1323
01:49:15,500 --> 01:49:19,231
I have them, tower. Relay Hawker
to land and hold on tarmac.

1324
01:50:16,527 --> 01:50:18,722
- Secure the area!
- Wider!

1325
01:50:18,930 --> 01:50:21,023
- Armed police!
- You two, round the back!

1326
01:50:21,399 --> 01:50:24,596
Armed police!
Put your hands in the air!

1327
01:50:24,802 --> 01:50:26,736
- Three men up!
- Ready!

1328
01:50:26,938 --> 01:50:29,532
Put your hands in the air! Do it now!

1329
01:50:29,741 --> 01:50:32,141
I'm afraid that's
easier said than done in my case.

1330
01:50:34,212 --> 01:50:35,509
Oh, good morning.

1331
01:50:35,713 --> 01:50:38,580
Did that old cannabis charge
finally catch up with me?

1332
01:50:38,783 --> 01:50:41,479
Sir, the French police say
you're transporting fugitives...

1333
01:50:41,686 --> 01:50:43,449
...and you may have
a hostage onboard.

1334
01:50:43,655 --> 01:50:45,179
I'm to take you all into custody.

1335
01:50:45,390 --> 01:50:48,723
Sadly, I have an important medical
appointment which I can't miss.

1336
01:50:48,926 --> 01:50:50,154
I'll fetch the car, sir.

1337
01:50:50,361 --> 01:50:53,194
This is serious, sir. The French police
are on their way. Stop!

1338
01:50:53,798 --> 01:50:57,063
Inspector, I can't afford the time
to indulge your games.

1339
01:50:57,268 --> 01:50:58,599
I'm late and I'm leaving.

1340
01:50:58,803 --> 01:51:00,634
If it's so important
for you to stop us...

1341
01:51:00,838 --> 01:51:03,068
...then you're just going
to have to shoot us.

1342
01:51:03,608 --> 01:51:05,235
You can start with him.

1343
01:51:10,648 --> 01:51:12,206
Search the plane.

1344
01:51:12,417 --> 01:51:13,645
All right.

1345
01:51:25,863 --> 01:51:27,524
I could run them over.

1346
01:51:33,037 --> 01:51:34,129
Bad tip.

1347
01:51:36,174 --> 01:51:37,539
Let him go.

1348
01:51:42,046 --> 01:51:44,412
The French cannot be trusted.

1349
01:51:53,123 --> 01:51:54,090
Everyone comfy?

1350
01:51:56,560 --> 01:51:57,527
Biscuits?

1351
01:51:58,095 --> 01:51:59,756
They didn't notice anything?

1352
01:52:00,163 --> 01:52:04,623
Well, people rarely notice things right
in front of their eyes, don't you find?

1353
01:52:18,715 --> 01:52:21,240
Do you have the bonds, bishop?

1354
01:52:21,485 --> 01:52:22,713
Yes, I do, Teacher.

1355
01:52:22,919 --> 01:52:26,218
I have chosen an Opus Dei
residence for the exchange.

1356
01:52:26,423 --> 01:52:27,856
I am honored.

1357
01:52:28,125 --> 01:52:32,926
By the time you get to London,
I will have the Grail.

1358
01:52:35,532 --> 01:52:38,501
- I take it the news is good, then.
- I fly to London.

1359
01:52:38,702 --> 01:52:40,693
The Teacher is waiting for me there.

1360
01:52:40,904 --> 01:52:44,499
He has chosen a house of Opus Dei
to make the exchange.

1361
01:52:44,708 --> 01:52:49,077
Mere currency
for the location of the Grail.

1362
01:52:49,279 --> 01:52:51,247
Imagine it.

1363
01:52:57,154 --> 01:53:02,148
Remember, if we are discovered by
the Vatican, we are excommunicated.

1364
01:53:02,359 --> 01:53:05,351
- So should anything go wrong...
- Yes, I know, I know.

1365
01:53:06,496 --> 01:53:08,157
This council does not exist.

1366
01:53:09,166 --> 01:53:10,895
As it never has.

1367
01:53:13,770 --> 01:53:17,501
Old friend. Heaven protect you.

1368
01:53:25,015 --> 01:53:26,983
Keep an eye out for the police.

1369
01:53:40,130 --> 01:53:42,758
I must say, Robert,
I'm quite impressed...

1370
01:53:42,966 --> 01:53:46,231
...by the way you withstood
my little aeroplane.

1371
01:53:47,871 --> 01:53:49,395
Did he never tell you?

1372
01:53:49,606 --> 01:53:52,905
When he was a boy,
young Robert fell into a well.

1373
01:53:53,109 --> 01:53:54,736
How old were you?

1374
01:53:54,945 --> 01:53:56,071
Seven.

1375
01:53:58,782 --> 01:54:01,842
Treading water all night long,
screaming his lungs out...

1376
01:54:02,052 --> 01:54:04,043
...to the echoes screaming back.

1377
01:54:04,254 --> 01:54:06,779
When they found him,
he was nearly catatonic.

1378
01:54:06,990 --> 01:54:08,048
Help!

1379
01:54:09,125 --> 01:54:10,456
It was a long time ago.

1380
01:54:10,660 --> 01:54:12,252
Oh, now, now, Robert.

1381
01:54:12,462 --> 01:54:16,956
You above all people shouldn't be one
to dismiss the influence of the past.

1382
01:54:22,172 --> 01:54:25,471
Temple Church.
I always forget it's right here.

1383
01:54:25,675 --> 01:54:31,341
Built 1185 and modern London
just sprang up right around it.

1384
01:54:34,451 --> 01:54:38,717
Tell me, why has the Priory kept the
Grail location secret all these years?

1385
01:54:38,922 --> 01:54:39,889
I don't know.

1386
01:54:40,290 --> 01:54:42,918
Some say the Priory wait
for the heir to reveal himself...

1387
01:54:43,126 --> 01:54:44,889
...which is especially odd...

1388
01:54:45,095 --> 01:54:48,428
...since legend suggests he may not
know his own true identity.

1389
01:54:56,439 --> 01:54:57,406
Hello?

1390
01:54:58,207 --> 01:55:00,835
Why do they make them so scary?

1391
01:55:06,482 --> 01:55:07,574
Oh, it's cold.

1392
01:55:07,783 --> 01:55:11,082
"In London lies a knight
a Pope interred."

1393
01:55:20,963 --> 01:55:24,364
So which tomb has an orb?

1394
01:55:40,716 --> 01:55:43,913
Those knights
with their legs crossed...

1395
01:55:44,119 --> 01:55:46,178
...means they'd been
to the Holy Land.

1396
01:55:46,388 --> 01:55:49,619
Two wear tunics over their armor...

1397
01:55:49,825 --> 01:55:52,953
...and two have full-length robes.

1398
01:55:54,029 --> 01:55:55,758
Two are grasping swords.

1399
01:55:56,231 --> 01:55:59,826
And one... Two are praying.

1400
01:56:01,804 --> 01:56:03,772
This one has his arms at his sides.

1401
01:56:03,973 --> 01:56:07,636
Oh, and this poor fellow
has almost disappeared entirely.

1402
01:56:07,843 --> 01:56:12,542
I don't see any orb
that ought be on a tomb.

1403
01:56:13,449 --> 01:56:16,179
"Ought be on his tomb."
Are we looking for a missing orb?

1404
01:56:16,385 --> 01:56:18,250
Maybe.

1405
01:56:29,064 --> 01:56:30,622
These aren't tombs.

1406
01:56:30,833 --> 01:56:33,199
- What? Yes, of course they are.
- No.

1407
01:56:33,402 --> 01:56:35,393
- They're effigies.
- What?

1408
01:56:35,604 --> 01:56:37,504
Not tombs. There's no bodies here.

1409
01:56:37,873 --> 01:56:39,306
This place is wrong.

1410
01:56:41,343 --> 01:56:44,676
Can we go now? We should go.

1411
01:56:47,883 --> 01:56:49,544
Sophie! No!

1412
01:56:51,320 --> 01:56:52,753
Where is the keystone?

1413
01:56:53,889 --> 01:56:55,015
Do not test me!

1414
01:56:55,224 --> 01:56:56,486
- Let her go!
- Don't hurt her.

1415
01:56:56,692 --> 01:56:58,751
Give me the keystone! Give it to me!

1416
01:56:58,961 --> 01:57:00,656
Here! Here! Here it is! Here it is.

1417
01:57:00,863 --> 01:57:04,492
Just let her go, and you and I can...
We'll come to some agreement.

1418
01:57:05,100 --> 01:57:06,533
Remy.

1419
01:57:09,905 --> 01:57:12,430
Remy. No, no, no. No, put it away.

1420
01:57:13,742 --> 01:57:16,973
Put it away. They're too close
together. You don't have a clear shot.

1421
01:57:17,179 --> 01:57:19,545
- Yes, I do.
- What do you think you're doing?

1422
01:57:21,817 --> 01:57:26,220
Thank you, professor. For a moment,
this was getting complicated.

1423
01:57:26,422 --> 01:57:28,481
Oh, this is absurd.
Oh, for God's sake, man!

1424
01:57:31,827 --> 01:57:33,920
That was satisfying.

1425
01:57:34,129 --> 01:57:35,994
I'm glad this bullshit is over.

1426
01:57:39,234 --> 01:57:40,963
Throw Teabing in the trunk.

1427
01:57:41,170 --> 01:57:42,398
What?

1428
01:57:47,843 --> 01:57:49,811
Here. You okay?

1429
01:57:55,350 --> 01:57:56,317
Sorry.

1430
01:58:37,291 --> 01:58:39,088
I don't think he's following.

1431
01:58:47,301 --> 01:58:51,203
They won't kill Leigh
until they find the Grail.

1432
01:58:53,307 --> 01:58:56,538
- So we have to find it before they do.
- I have to get to a library, fast.

1433
01:59:04,485 --> 01:59:06,112
Lieutenant!

1434
01:59:06,320 --> 01:59:07,912
One flag off the prints.

1435
01:59:11,626 --> 01:59:13,617
Remy Legaludec.

1436
01:59:13,828 --> 01:59:15,420
Petty theft.

1437
01:59:17,231 --> 01:59:20,997
Skipped out on a hospital bill
for a tracheotomy.

1438
01:59:22,904 --> 01:59:24,735
Peanut allergy.

1439
01:59:26,174 --> 01:59:27,539
Like Marie.

1440
01:59:27,742 --> 01:59:29,175
This way. Marie?

1441
01:59:29,377 --> 01:59:32,039
My daughter.

1442
01:59:32,246 --> 01:59:33,838
Over here.

1443
01:59:40,721 --> 01:59:41,710
Where?

1444
01:59:41,923 --> 01:59:43,185
Up there.

1445
02:00:00,608 --> 02:00:02,269
What's all that?

1446
02:00:02,476 --> 02:00:04,808
Very advanced surveillance.

1447
02:00:09,550 --> 02:00:10,847
It's a listening post.

1448
02:00:20,328 --> 02:00:22,489
Get me Fache.

1449
02:00:22,697 --> 02:00:27,600
Four of these names are
the men killed last night.

1450
02:00:35,743 --> 02:00:40,680
He once whined to me about the
wasted space of so large a trunk.

1451
02:00:41,148 --> 02:00:43,275
Let's see if he complains so now.

1452
02:00:44,352 --> 02:00:46,286
Are you the Teacher?

1453
02:00:49,523 --> 02:00:50,547
I am.

1454
02:00:52,360 --> 02:00:56,854
Superbly done.
You've been of great service.

1455
02:01:00,368 --> 02:01:03,132
The cryptex has yet to be opened.
I can still serve.

1456
02:01:03,337 --> 02:01:05,464
You've done enough.

1457
02:01:08,708 --> 02:01:12,371
We cannot let ego
deter us from our goal.

1458
02:01:13,546 --> 02:01:15,480
I understand.

1459
02:01:16,549 --> 02:01:17,675
Good.

1460
02:01:20,887 --> 02:01:25,654
Wait here, at this house of Opus Dei,
and you will be rewarded.

1461
02:01:25,859 --> 02:01:28,054
I will dispose of the old man.

1462
02:01:29,229 --> 02:01:30,856
Bless you, Silas.

1463
02:01:32,899 --> 02:01:34,127
Teacher.

1464
02:01:42,342 --> 02:01:44,071
Christ be with you.

1465
02:01:46,813 --> 02:01:51,944
We're at least a half-hour
to Chelsea Library.

1466
02:01:52,252 --> 02:01:54,277
If we're gonna help Leigh,
that's too long.

1467
02:02:05,999 --> 02:02:07,398
Where you going?

1468
02:02:07,600 --> 02:02:09,727
Getting you a library card.

1469
02:02:13,340 --> 02:02:15,365
Excuse me. May I sit next to you?

1470
02:02:15,575 --> 02:02:18,066
- Yeah, sure.
- Thank you.

1471
02:02:26,619 --> 02:02:27,916
That's great.

1472
02:02:28,855 --> 02:02:31,050
Didn't say you had a boyfriend.

1473
02:02:33,760 --> 02:02:35,057
Thanks.

1474
02:02:35,695 --> 02:02:38,994
Let's see if we can access
the database on this.

1475
02:02:39,199 --> 02:02:42,600
"In London lies a knight
a Pope interred."

1476
02:02:42,802 --> 02:02:44,565
Compounding keywords:

1477
02:02:44,771 --> 02:02:47,638
Knight, Pope, Grail.

1478
02:02:48,274 --> 02:02:52,267
Your precious treasure was
almost lost, and with it, my fortune.

1479
02:02:56,683 --> 02:02:58,947
Can you believe how well I did?

1480
02:03:00,520 --> 02:03:02,647
I even convinced the monk.

1481
02:03:03,523 --> 02:03:05,457
I should be in theater.

1482
02:03:12,165 --> 02:03:17,660
A toast to our success, Teacher.
The end of the journey is near.

1483
02:03:20,206 --> 02:03:23,505
Your identity shall go
with me to the grave.

1484
02:03:28,948 --> 02:03:32,577
There's your problem, mate.
It's your basic linguistic coincidence.

1485
02:03:33,019 --> 02:03:35,146
See, keywords keep coming up
with the writings...

1486
02:03:35,355 --> 02:03:38,290
...of some bloke named
Alexander Pope.

1487
02:03:38,491 --> 02:03:39,719
"A. Pope."

1488
02:03:41,361 --> 02:03:43,124
Your grandfather was a genius.

1489
02:03:48,034 --> 02:03:49,058
Come on.

1490
02:04:23,735 --> 02:04:25,430
Emergency.
Which service do you require?

1491
02:04:25,637 --> 02:04:30,734
I know the location of two murderers
wanted by French police.

1492
02:04:34,646 --> 02:04:36,739
We've just had a 999 call.

1493
02:04:36,949 --> 02:04:39,281
Triangulation leads back
to Docklands.

1494
02:04:39,485 --> 02:04:41,544
Caller was male.
Claimed your two murderers...

1495
02:04:41,753 --> 02:04:44,347
...are hiding at an Opus Dei house.

1496
02:04:53,499 --> 02:04:57,595
The knight we're looking for
is Sir Isaac Newton.

1497
02:04:59,137 --> 02:05:02,834
His life's work produced new sciences
that incurred the wrath of the Church.

1498
02:05:03,342 --> 02:05:05,606
Gravity, for God sakes.

1499
02:05:06,979 --> 02:05:10,039
And if you choose to believe...

1500
02:05:10,249 --> 02:05:14,652
...he was also a Grand Master
of the Priory as well.

1501
02:05:25,230 --> 02:05:27,824
But if he offended
the Catholic Church...

1502
02:05:28,033 --> 02:05:31,799
...the Pope would be the last person
to preside over his funeral.

1503
02:05:32,004 --> 02:05:34,199
Well, that's where I got it wrong.

1504
02:05:34,406 --> 02:05:37,307
"In London lies a knight
a Pope interred."

1505
02:05:37,509 --> 02:05:40,569
Sir Isaac Newton's funeral
was presided over...

1506
02:05:40,779 --> 02:05:44,408
...by his good friend,
his colleague, Alexander Pope.

1507
02:05:44,616 --> 02:05:49,053
A. Pope. His first initial.
How did I miss that?

1508
02:05:49,521 --> 02:05:50,579
Here.

1509
02:05:50,956 --> 02:05:54,084
Yes. Isaac Newton's tomb.

1510
02:05:55,227 --> 02:05:56,421
An orb.

1511
02:05:56,628 --> 02:06:01,588
Yes. Which one? It's not possible
to tell if a particular orb is missing.

1512
02:06:01,800 --> 02:06:05,292
"An orb with Rosy flesh
and seeded womb."

1513
02:06:05,504 --> 02:06:10,066
Solar system. The planets.
Constellations. Signs of the zodiac.

1514
02:06:10,676 --> 02:06:12,769
See, our moon is missing.

1515
02:06:12,978 --> 02:06:15,811
The moons of Saturn and Jupiter.
They're not here.

1516
02:06:16,181 --> 02:06:18,706
Eyes of the cherubs themselves?

1517
02:06:20,719 --> 02:06:23,620
Robert. These tracks.

1518
02:06:24,489 --> 02:06:26,787
Look at the cane marks in the dust.

1519
02:06:29,895 --> 02:06:31,294
Teabing was here.

1520
02:06:32,698 --> 02:06:33,858
He was alone.

1521
02:06:35,867 --> 02:06:39,963
When the two of you
arrived at my home as you did...

1522
02:06:41,106 --> 02:06:43,904
...others might call it God's will.

1523
02:06:44,810 --> 02:06:47,301
I believed that if I had the cryptex...

1524
02:06:47,679 --> 02:06:50,705
...I could solve the riddle alone.

1525
02:06:51,617 --> 02:06:53,084
But I was unworthy.

1526
02:06:53,285 --> 02:06:54,547
But you...

1527
02:06:55,387 --> 02:06:57,821
You have a reason to be here.

1528
02:06:58,023 --> 02:07:01,652
You're the last remaining
guardian of the Grail.

1529
02:07:01,893 --> 02:07:03,986
Your grandfather
and the other senechaux...

1530
02:07:04,196 --> 02:07:06,164
...would not have lied
with dying breath...

1531
02:07:06,365 --> 02:07:09,198
...unless they knew
their secret was preserved.

1532
02:07:11,637 --> 02:07:14,367
How could you know
Sauniere's last words?

1533
02:07:14,573 --> 02:07:15,540
Leigh.

1534
02:07:16,742 --> 02:07:19,005
Grail quests require sacrifice.

1535
02:07:19,543 --> 02:07:20,874
You are a murderer.

1536
02:07:21,078 --> 02:07:24,104
No. No. Robert, tell her.

1537
02:07:24,315 --> 02:07:28,115
When history is written,
murderers are heroes.

1538
02:07:30,221 --> 02:07:32,246
You self-righteous bastard!

1539
02:07:32,456 --> 02:07:33,753
We need to just walk away.

1540
02:07:33,958 --> 02:07:35,755
- No, don't. Don't.
- Walk away.

1541
02:07:39,063 --> 02:07:40,621
I'll do what I have to now.

1542
02:07:45,970 --> 02:07:47,096
Anything.

1543
02:07:51,242 --> 02:07:52,675
Do you understand?

1544
02:07:54,378 --> 02:07:56,039
So now...

1545
02:07:57,248 --> 02:07:59,273
...can't we all be friends again?

1546
02:08:00,584 --> 02:08:01,881
This way.

1547
02:08:38,155 --> 02:08:41,955
I'm going to put this gun down.
I only want you both to listen.

1548
02:08:43,828 --> 02:08:45,022
I'm listening now.

1549
02:08:45,629 --> 02:08:47,028
For 2000 years...

1550
02:08:47,665 --> 02:08:51,567
...the Church has rained oppression
and atrocity upon mankind...

1551
02:08:52,369 --> 02:08:57,306
...crushed passion and idea alike,
all in the name of their walking God.

1552
02:08:57,575 --> 02:09:01,978
Proof of Jesus' mortality can bring
an end to all that suffering...

1553
02:09:02,480 --> 02:09:05,381
...drive this church of lies
to its knees.

1554
02:09:07,051 --> 02:09:08,609
Armed police!

1555
02:09:08,886 --> 02:09:10,183
Drop your weapon!

1556
02:09:13,791 --> 02:09:14,758
Stop, Silas!

1557
02:09:27,605 --> 02:09:30,733
We are betrayed, my son.

1558
02:09:31,342 --> 02:09:33,936
The living heir must be revealed.

1559
02:09:34,445 --> 02:09:36,675
Jesus must be shown
for what he was.

1560
02:09:36,881 --> 02:09:40,078
Not miraculous, simply man.

1561
02:09:41,185 --> 02:09:42,652
I'm sorry.

1562
02:09:44,822 --> 02:09:46,414
Armed police!

1563
02:09:46,791 --> 02:09:49,885
Drop your weapon! Drop it! Drop it!

1564
02:09:59,336 --> 02:10:01,827
Put it down now! Put it down!

1565
02:10:09,547 --> 02:10:11,572
I am a ghost.

1566
02:10:12,750 --> 02:10:15,344
The dark con can be exposed.

1567
02:10:15,586 --> 02:10:20,888
Mankind can finally be set free,
and we can do it, Robert.

1568
02:10:22,159 --> 02:10:23,683
The three of us.

1569
02:10:41,611 --> 02:10:43,010
How is Silas?

1570
02:10:43,213 --> 02:10:45,545
Is he...? Is he alive?

1571
02:10:45,915 --> 02:10:47,007
The monk?

1572
02:10:50,587 --> 02:10:53,522
Bishop, how would you know
this killer's name?

1573
02:10:55,091 --> 02:10:56,786
Get me out of here, Fache.

1574
02:10:57,360 --> 02:10:58,349
Wait.

1575
02:11:01,865 --> 02:11:04,857
Langdon never came to you
in confession, did he?

1576
02:11:05,602 --> 02:11:09,800
One of your followers called you
about the crime-scene photos.

1577
02:11:10,707 --> 02:11:15,667
I cannot be implicated here. There are
still important works to be done.

1578
02:11:17,447 --> 02:11:18,744
You used me.

1579
02:11:20,650 --> 02:11:22,675
God uses us all.

1580
02:11:23,486 --> 02:11:25,010
Help me, Fache.

1581
02:11:26,189 --> 02:11:27,247
Take him.

1582
02:11:31,961 --> 02:11:33,792
- Did you get his cell phone?
- Yes, sir.

1583
02:11:33,997 --> 02:11:36,022
I'm going to need a trace.

1584
02:11:38,902 --> 02:11:40,699
Your Silas is dead.

1585
02:11:47,844 --> 02:11:49,573
The Priory's sacred charge...

1586
02:11:49,779 --> 02:11:52,805
...was to reveal the heir
at the dawn of the new millennium.

1587
02:11:53,816 --> 02:11:58,947
The millennium came and went
and the living heir remained hidden.

1588
02:11:59,155 --> 02:12:03,057
The Priory failed
in their sacred charge.

1589
02:12:03,860 --> 02:12:05,885
So, what choice did I have?

1590
02:12:10,166 --> 02:12:11,963
I sought out the enemy.

1591
02:12:13,436 --> 02:12:17,839
I persuaded them, the Council
of Shadows, that I was an ally.

1592
02:12:18,408 --> 02:12:22,105
I even asked them for money
so they would never suspect me.

1593
02:12:22,612 --> 02:12:25,581
Rector, I made them call me.

1594
02:12:26,149 --> 02:12:27,116
"Teacher."

1595
02:12:27,383 --> 02:12:28,611
- Why don't you and l...
- No.

1596
02:12:28,818 --> 02:12:31,378
Robert, no words. On your knees.

1597
02:12:31,854 --> 02:12:33,014
Do it.

1598
02:12:33,589 --> 02:12:34,954
No, I mean it. Down.

1599
02:12:36,025 --> 02:12:38,823
Not you. No, my dear, you...

1600
02:12:41,497 --> 02:12:43,863
You're my miracle, Sophie.

1601
02:12:44,534 --> 02:12:46,968
You're the guardian of the Grail.

1602
02:12:47,937 --> 02:12:51,429
All the oppression of the poor
and the powerless...

1603
02:12:51,641 --> 02:12:54,508
...of those of different skin,
of women.

1604
02:12:54,711 --> 02:12:57,942
You can put an end to all that.

1605
02:12:58,147 --> 02:13:01,844
You must explode the truth
onto the world.

1606
02:13:02,652 --> 02:13:04,119
It's your duty.

1607
02:13:07,056 --> 02:13:09,786
You know the answer to this riddle.

1608
02:13:11,260 --> 02:13:12,750
Open the cryptex...

1609
02:13:14,397 --> 02:13:16,058
...and I'll put down the gun.

1610
02:13:34,249 --> 02:13:36,217
I have no idea how.

1611
02:13:36,418 --> 02:13:38,283
I don't know the code.

1612
02:13:38,487 --> 02:13:41,149
And even if I did, I wouldn't tell you.

1613
02:13:46,795 --> 02:13:49,093
Like your grandfather, then.

1614
02:13:49,831 --> 02:13:52,800
Willing to die for your secret.

1615
02:13:53,969 --> 02:13:57,461
But by the way you've been
looking at your hero...

1616
02:13:57,672 --> 02:14:02,405
...I wonder, would you
let him die for you?

1617
02:14:02,811 --> 02:14:05,006
Open it, Sophie, to save his life.

1618
02:14:05,213 --> 02:14:07,340
- Leigh, you can't just...
- Open the cryptex.

1619
02:14:08,016 --> 02:14:09,005
I don't know how.

1620
02:14:09,217 --> 02:14:11,117
Open it or he dies.

1621
02:14:11,319 --> 02:14:13,219
- I swear, I don't know.
- Do it! Do it!

1622
02:14:13,422 --> 02:14:14,719
- Stop it!
- I don't know!

1623
02:14:14,923 --> 02:14:16,254
Stop it!

1624
02:14:21,830 --> 02:14:23,821
She can't do it, Leigh.

1625
02:14:35,877 --> 02:14:37,674
But give me a moment.

1626
02:14:47,856 --> 02:14:49,483
Robert.

1627
02:15:02,671 --> 02:15:03,797
What are you doing?

1628
02:15:04,606 --> 02:15:05,766
Please.

1629
02:16:25,987 --> 02:16:27,420
I'm sorry.

1630
02:16:37,598 --> 02:16:38,690
I'm sorry.

1631
02:16:41,702 --> 02:16:43,135
No!

1632
02:16:51,178 --> 02:16:52,338
No, Robert!

1633
02:16:53,347 --> 02:16:54,609
No!

1634
02:16:55,516 --> 02:16:56,483
No.

1635
02:16:56,984 --> 02:16:59,179
Oh, the map. It's ruined.

1636
02:17:06,627 --> 02:17:08,094
The map is ruined.

1637
02:17:09,029 --> 02:17:10,360
The Grail.

1638
02:17:10,965 --> 02:17:12,091
It's lost.

1639
02:17:12,800 --> 02:17:14,267
The Grail is gone.

1640
02:17:14,635 --> 02:17:17,365
Only the worthy
find the Grail, Leigh.

1641
02:17:18,472 --> 02:17:20,030
You taught me that.

1642
02:17:23,577 --> 02:17:24,669
Armed police!

1643
02:17:24,878 --> 02:17:27,210
Drop it! Drop your weapon!

1644
02:17:27,514 --> 02:17:28,913
Put the gun down.

1645
02:17:31,652 --> 02:17:33,984
Put the gun down.

1646
02:17:38,759 --> 02:17:41,523
That one. The old man.

1647
02:17:41,729 --> 02:17:42,696
You're under arrest!

1648
02:17:42,896 --> 02:17:45,091
You do not have to say anything,
but it may harm your defense...

1649
02:17:45,299 --> 02:17:47,199
...if you do not mention,
when questioned...

1650
02:17:47,401 --> 02:17:49,392
...something which you
later rely on in court.

1651
02:17:49,603 --> 02:17:52,265
Anything you do say
will be given in evidence.

1652
02:18:02,950 --> 02:18:05,248
I'll have some questions for you.

1653
02:18:40,654 --> 02:18:43,122
Big crowd out there now.

1654
02:18:43,724 --> 02:18:47,160
Thank you for your statements.
You are free to go, of course.

1655
02:18:56,236 --> 02:18:58,864
I'm sorry. You thought
he was your friend, no?

1656
02:18:59,139 --> 02:19:01,573
It wasn't only us, was it?

1657
02:19:03,210 --> 02:19:04,871
He used you too.

1658
02:19:07,014 --> 02:19:08,572
Leave us, please.

1659
02:19:11,752 --> 02:19:12,741
Leave us, please.

1660
02:19:24,231 --> 02:19:26,791
I should have been smarter.

1661
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:29,332
I acted on faith, I suppose.

1662
02:19:30,237 --> 02:19:31,602
I'm sorry.

1663
02:19:32,873 --> 02:19:34,465
How many?

1664
02:19:34,675 --> 02:19:37,838
Your grandfather, the other three,
maybe more.

1665
02:19:39,146 --> 02:19:43,582
The monk was given to Teabing
as a gift, it seems.

1666
02:19:44,917 --> 02:19:47,112
To do as he asked.

1667
02:19:47,420 --> 02:19:50,651
Teabing killed the servant himself,
you know.

1668
02:19:50,857 --> 02:19:53,655
- Remy?
- Yes.

1669
02:19:53,860 --> 02:19:54,884
By poison.

1670
02:19:57,697 --> 02:20:00,188
How much of it
have you been able to figure out?

1671
02:20:01,267 --> 02:20:05,101
Some. Not enough for it
to make sense.

1672
02:20:06,239 --> 02:20:07,797
It won't ever make sense.

1673
02:20:19,218 --> 02:20:20,378
I'm sorry.

1674
02:20:35,368 --> 02:20:38,394
He forgot everything we've learned.

1675
02:20:39,105 --> 02:20:41,164
Everything we teach.

1676
02:20:44,343 --> 02:20:47,107
It's why we study history.

1677
02:20:47,914 --> 02:20:50,940
So we'll stop killing each other.

1678
02:21:13,039 --> 02:21:16,736
Robert! Robert! Robert!
How could you do it?

1679
02:21:16,943 --> 02:21:19,104
How could you? Robert!

1680
02:21:19,545 --> 02:21:21,843
To destroy our hope of freedom.

1681
02:21:22,248 --> 02:21:25,547
To deny every pilgrim the chance
to kneel at the tomb of the Magdalene.

1682
02:21:25,751 --> 02:21:26,945
How could you?

1683
02:21:31,691 --> 02:21:33,625
You couldn't! You solved it.

1684
02:21:36,095 --> 02:21:39,553
You took the scroll out
before it broke!

1685
02:21:39,765 --> 02:21:43,724
You solved it. Oh, you'll find it, Robert.
You'll find it. You know what to do.

1686
02:21:43,936 --> 02:21:46,166
You'll find the Grail,
you'll kneel before her...

1687
02:21:46,372 --> 02:21:48,397
...and you'll set her free
upon the world!

1688
02:21:48,608 --> 02:21:52,009
That man there,
he's got the map to the Holy Grail!

1689
02:22:02,522 --> 02:22:07,425
There was every orb conceivable
on that tomb except one:

1690
02:22:08,361 --> 02:22:12,525
The orb which fell from the heavens
and inspired Newton's life's work.

1691
02:22:12,732 --> 02:22:17,601
Work that incurred the wrath
of the Church until his dying day.

1692
02:22:20,873 --> 02:22:22,340
A-P-P-L-E.

1693
02:22:23,442 --> 02:22:24,636
Apple.

1694
02:22:39,258 --> 02:22:42,227
The Holy Grail 'neath
ancient Roslin waits

1695
02:22:42,428 --> 02:22:44,794
The blade and chalice
guarding o'er her gates

1696
02:22:44,997 --> 02:22:47,055
Adorned in masters'
loving art, she lies

1697
02:22:47,265 --> 02:22:51,133
She rests at last
beneath the starry skies

1698
02:22:52,771 --> 02:22:54,705
I think I know where she's gone.

1699
02:22:55,607 --> 02:22:58,132
I think the Grail has gone home.

1700
02:23:17,996 --> 02:23:22,831
Built by the Templars themselves.
Named for the original Rose Line.

1701
02:23:23,034 --> 02:23:24,899
Rosslyn Chapel.

1702
02:23:26,037 --> 02:23:27,800
So this is it.

1703
02:23:28,807 --> 02:23:30,672
The gift at the end.

1704
02:23:31,643 --> 02:23:35,374
"The Holy Grail 'neath
ancient Roslin waits."

1705
02:23:36,314 --> 02:23:39,545
You never told me the joke
Sauniere made of you.

1706
02:23:39,818 --> 02:23:41,115
What was it?

1707
02:23:41,653 --> 02:23:43,553
He called me a flatfoot.

1708
02:23:43,855 --> 02:23:46,119
A beat cop of history.

1709
02:23:46,858 --> 02:23:48,917
Oh, a dumb policeman...

1710
02:23:49,127 --> 02:23:52,528
...who just does his job
day after day, of history.

1711
02:23:52,731 --> 02:23:56,497
You know, his father was one.
A policeman.

1712
02:23:57,135 --> 02:24:01,868
Sauniere said he was the most
honorable man he had ever known.

1713
02:24:05,744 --> 02:24:08,406
We are who we protect, I think.

1714
02:24:09,347 --> 02:24:11,076
What we stand up for.

1715
02:24:22,994 --> 02:24:24,393
Jewish...

1716
02:24:25,497 --> 02:24:28,227
...Christian, Egyptian...

1717
02:24:29,534 --> 02:24:31,934
...Masonic, pagan...

1718
02:24:33,004 --> 02:24:34,733
...Templar crosses...

1719
02:24:35,340 --> 02:24:36,739
...pyramids.

1720
02:24:44,482 --> 02:24:48,248
I think I've been here before.

1721
02:24:48,453 --> 02:24:49,579
Sophie.

1722
02:25:09,474 --> 02:25:11,169
A very long time ago.

1723
02:25:13,545 --> 02:25:15,308
Come along, Sophie.

1724
02:25:30,562 --> 02:25:31,620
Sophie.

1725
02:25:32,664 --> 02:25:33,790
Over here.

1726
02:25:41,539 --> 02:25:45,134
"The blade and chalice
guarding o'er her gates."

1727
02:25:45,510 --> 02:25:47,944
Pagan symbols for
male and female.

1728
02:25:49,948 --> 02:25:51,710
Fused as one.

1729
02:25:52,149 --> 02:25:54,242
As the pagans would have wanted.

1730
02:25:55,886 --> 02:25:57,615
We're about to close, I'm afraid.

1731
02:26:03,861 --> 02:26:06,193
We're just gonna be a moment.

1732
02:26:55,412 --> 02:26:56,709
Robert.

1733
02:27:29,913 --> 02:27:31,710
I've never seen that before.

1734
02:27:36,987 --> 02:27:39,319
The style is...

1735
02:27:40,824 --> 02:27:42,416
It's unmistakable.

1736
02:27:51,668 --> 02:27:53,932
These could have been painted by
Leonardo da Vinci.

1737
02:27:56,073 --> 02:27:59,167
"Adorned in masters'
loving art, she lies."

1738
02:27:59,743 --> 02:28:05,545
"She rests at last
beneath the starry skies."

1739
02:28:24,334 --> 02:28:26,029
The fleur-de-lis.

1740
02:29:17,119 --> 02:29:18,108
She was here.

1741
02:29:21,223 --> 02:29:22,781
Her sarcophagus.

1742
02:29:24,927 --> 02:29:26,519
Mary Magdalene.

1743
02:29:28,230 --> 02:29:30,255
The Holy Grail herself.

1744
02:29:31,834 --> 02:29:33,358
She was here.

1745
02:29:40,609 --> 02:29:44,773
With modern DNA testing,
those bones...

1746
02:29:44,981 --> 02:29:48,473
...could have shown definitive proof
of a bloodline.

1747
02:29:50,686 --> 02:29:52,313
Where did she go?

1748
02:29:53,356 --> 02:29:55,722
Did the Church finally get her?

1749
02:30:10,306 --> 02:30:12,831
This is incredible. Look at this.

1750
02:30:13,042 --> 02:30:16,341
Look at this. These records
go back thousands of years.

1751
02:30:17,613 --> 02:30:20,446
They date back
to the death of Christ.

1752
02:30:22,752 --> 02:30:26,119
Good God, could these
really be the Grail documents?

1753
02:30:48,177 --> 02:30:52,443
What did he want from us?
To find her sarcophagus?

1754
02:30:53,449 --> 02:30:56,145
How was I ever supposed
to figure all this out?

1755
02:30:56,585 --> 02:30:58,985
When you and your
grandfather fought...

1756
02:30:59,188 --> 02:31:01,884
...was it something about your past?

1757
02:31:03,726 --> 02:31:05,489
How could you know that?

1758
02:31:06,195 --> 02:31:08,925
About how your parents died?

1759
02:31:09,932 --> 02:31:11,593
Sophie?

1760
02:31:13,869 --> 02:31:16,099
It was during primary school.

1761
02:31:17,706 --> 02:31:19,697
I was in his library.

1762
02:31:21,510 --> 02:31:23,000
Doing research.

1763
02:31:23,212 --> 02:31:25,840
I was trying to find out
about my family.

1764
02:31:26,048 --> 02:31:28,278
Sophie, where are you, princess?

1765
02:31:29,118 --> 02:31:31,416
I wanted to know about them.

1766
02:31:32,121 --> 02:31:34,112
But I couldn't find any records.

1767
02:31:35,291 --> 02:31:37,191
Not of their death...

1768
02:31:38,661 --> 02:31:40,526
...not of the accident.

1769
02:31:41,197 --> 02:31:43,529
I'd asked him for as long
as I could remember...

1770
02:31:43,732 --> 02:31:45,029
...but he would never tell me.

1771
02:31:45,234 --> 02:31:46,895
I told you, no.

1772
02:31:49,371 --> 02:31:50,804
But why can't I?

1773
02:31:51,173 --> 02:31:53,004
He stood over me...

1774
02:31:54,743 --> 02:31:56,768
...and he wouldn't let me leave.

1775
02:31:56,979 --> 02:31:58,776
They're dead. Dead and buried.

1776
02:31:59,315 --> 02:32:00,941
Never look for them, Sophie.

1777
02:32:01,249 --> 02:32:02,409
Promise me.

1778
02:32:03,918 --> 02:32:04,976
Swear it!

1779
02:32:05,753 --> 02:32:06,845
Swear it to me!

1780
02:32:17,532 --> 02:32:19,500
I kept my promise.

1781
02:32:23,138 --> 02:32:25,936
The next week he sent me
to boarding school.

1782
02:32:27,642 --> 02:32:31,009
One weekend
I came home unexpectedly.

1783
02:32:32,147 --> 02:32:34,945
And what I saw
my grandfather doing...

1784
02:32:35,917 --> 02:32:37,509
Some ritual.

1785
02:32:39,554 --> 02:32:41,112
I was so frightened.

1786
02:32:45,827 --> 02:32:47,988
We hardly ever spoke again.

1787
02:32:51,733 --> 02:32:56,761
Do you have any memories of your
grandfather before the accident?

1788
02:32:57,839 --> 02:33:00,034
Before your parents were killed?

1789
02:33:00,742 --> 02:33:03,302
Yeah. No. I don't know.

1790
02:33:04,479 --> 02:33:05,571
Why?

1791
02:33:08,349 --> 02:33:10,715
Because I don't think
he was your grandfather.

1792
02:33:30,205 --> 02:33:32,173
These are my parents.

1793
02:33:34,342 --> 02:33:35,673
My brother.

1794
02:33:37,378 --> 02:33:39,175
And this is you, isn't it?

1795
02:33:44,152 --> 02:33:47,815
The paper says
the entire family was killed.

1796
02:33:48,323 --> 02:33:52,157
The mother, the father, the boy, 6...

1797
02:33:53,995 --> 02:33:56,259
...and the girl, 4.

1798
02:33:57,865 --> 02:34:02,461
But your name was never Sauniere.
It's Saint-Clair.

1799
02:34:05,907 --> 02:34:08,239
It's one of the oldest families
in France.

1800
02:34:08,910 --> 02:34:12,641
It's from a line of the
Merovingian kings.

1801
02:34:21,256 --> 02:34:23,053
Royal blood.

1802
02:34:25,093 --> 02:34:26,685
I was so wrong.

1803
02:34:28,329 --> 02:34:32,629
Sauniere didn't want you to help guard
the secret of the Holy Grail.

1804
02:34:34,369 --> 02:34:35,666
Sophie...

1805
02:34:38,206 --> 02:34:40,333
...you are the secret.

1806
02:34:41,709 --> 02:34:44,177
You survived the accident.

1807
02:34:44,445 --> 02:34:47,073
If it even was an accident.

1808
02:34:47,282 --> 02:34:49,216
The Priory found out.

1809
02:34:49,851 --> 02:34:53,014
Somehow they concealed
the fact that you were alive.

1810
02:34:53,621 --> 02:34:56,920
They hid you with the
Grand Master himself...

1811
02:34:57,458 --> 02:34:59,619
...who raised you as his own.

1812
02:35:00,695 --> 02:35:02,492
According to all of this...

1813
02:35:04,032 --> 02:35:05,659
...Princess Sophie...

1814
02:35:09,436 --> 02:35:10,903
...you are the heir.

1815
02:35:13,240 --> 02:35:15,105
The end of the bloodline.

1816
02:35:16,777 --> 02:35:20,042
You are the last living descendent...

1817
02:35:21,214 --> 02:35:23,045
...of Jesus Christ.

1818
02:36:08,528 --> 02:36:09,893
What is this?

1819
02:36:11,932 --> 02:36:13,160
Sophie?

1820
02:36:16,370 --> 02:36:17,462
Who are you?

1821
02:36:17,671 --> 02:36:20,139
There have been many names.

1822
02:36:20,674 --> 02:36:22,471
The keepers.

1823
02:36:23,343 --> 02:36:24,810
Guardians.

1824
02:36:25,212 --> 02:36:27,476
The Priory of Sion.

1825
02:36:27,848 --> 02:36:33,150
But to you, Sophie, we are friends
of the man who raised you:

1826
02:36:33,620 --> 02:36:35,212
Jacques Sauniere.

1827
02:36:37,657 --> 02:36:42,959
He would have wanted you to know
that he loved you very much.

1828
02:36:43,897 --> 02:36:47,856
And that the Priory are here
to protect you now...

1829
02:36:48,068 --> 02:36:51,231
...as they have always
protected our family.

1830
02:36:53,807 --> 02:36:55,900
I gave you up once...

1831
02:36:56,710 --> 02:36:59,736
...knowing I might
never see you again.

1832
02:37:03,216 --> 02:37:05,116
I'm your grandmother, Sophie.

1833
02:37:06,319 --> 02:37:11,621
I have prayed for this moment
for a very long time.

1834
02:37:13,326 --> 02:37:15,453
Welcome home, child.

1835
02:37:39,519 --> 02:37:40,577
Hey.

1836
02:37:43,089 --> 02:37:44,647
No more strings.

1837
02:37:49,196 --> 02:37:52,597
His last breath to keep me safe.

1838
02:37:56,937 --> 02:38:01,135
She has some things
she wants to tell me.

1839
02:38:01,942 --> 02:38:04,308
About my family.

1840
02:38:10,684 --> 02:38:11,809
What will you do?

1841
02:38:12,952 --> 02:38:16,683
The legend will be revealed
when the heir reveals himself.

1842
02:38:17,490 --> 02:38:19,924
They just got the pronoun wrong.

1843
02:38:23,262 --> 02:38:24,957
She said when Sauniere died...

1844
02:38:25,164 --> 02:38:28,930
...he took the location
of Mary's sarcophagus with him.

1845
02:38:29,134 --> 02:38:33,070
So there's no way to empirically prove
that I am related to her.

1846
02:38:35,241 --> 02:38:37,175
What would you do, Robert?

1847
02:38:38,143 --> 02:38:42,375
Okay, maybe there is no proof.
Maybe the Grail is lost forever.

1848
02:38:42,581 --> 02:38:46,813
But, Sophie, the only thing that
matters is what you believe.

1849
02:38:47,820 --> 02:38:50,846
History shows us
Jesus was an extraordinary man...

1850
02:38:51,056 --> 02:38:53,024
...a human inspiration. That's it.

1851
02:38:53,859 --> 02:38:56,555
That's all the evidence
has ever proved.

1852
02:38:58,097 --> 02:38:59,189
But...

1853
02:39:00,165 --> 02:39:02,030
...when I was a boy...

1854
02:39:04,436 --> 02:39:08,896
When I was down in that well
Teabing told you about...

1855
02:39:11,510 --> 02:39:14,274
...I thought I was going to die,
Sophie.

1856
02:39:16,248 --> 02:39:17,681
What I did...

1857
02:39:18,417 --> 02:39:19,782
...I prayed.

1858
02:39:21,287 --> 02:39:25,383
I prayed to Jesus to keep me alive...

1859
02:39:25,591 --> 02:39:27,320
...so I could see my parents again...

1860
02:39:27,526 --> 02:39:30,086
...so I could go to school again...

1861
02:39:30,529 --> 02:39:32,793
...so I could play with my dog.

1862
02:39:34,199 --> 02:39:37,498
Sometimes I wonder
if I wasn't alone down there.

1863
02:39:39,405 --> 02:39:42,135
Why does it have to be
human or divine?

1864
02:39:42,341 --> 02:39:44,241
Maybe human is divine.

1865
02:39:45,544 --> 02:39:47,375
Why couldn't Jesus
have been a father...

1866
02:39:47,580 --> 02:39:50,378
...and still been capable
of all those miracles?

1867
02:39:50,816 --> 02:39:53,341
Like turning water into wine?

1868
02:39:53,719 --> 02:39:57,348
Well, who knows?
His blood is your blood.

1869
02:39:57,556 --> 02:40:00,684
Maybe that junkie in the park
will never touch a drug again.

1870
02:40:01,293 --> 02:40:04,285
Maybe you healed my phobia
with your hands.

1871
02:40:04,496 --> 02:40:07,659
And maybe you're
a knight on a Grail quest.

1872
02:40:10,336 --> 02:40:13,066
Well, here's the question:

1873
02:40:13,839 --> 02:40:16,535
A living descendent
of Jesus Christ...

1874
02:40:18,077 --> 02:40:20,602
...would she destroy faith?

1875
02:40:21,180 --> 02:40:24,843
Or would she renew it?

1876
02:40:26,652 --> 02:40:29,883
So again I say, what matters
is what you believe.

1877
02:40:32,157 --> 02:40:33,454
Thank you.

1878
02:40:35,594 --> 02:40:36,822
For bringing me here.

1879
02:40:39,031 --> 02:40:41,522
For letting him choose you...

1880
02:40:42,234 --> 02:40:43,428
...Sir Robert.

1881
02:40:53,712 --> 02:40:54,679
You take care.

1882
02:40:56,281 --> 02:40:57,407
Yes.

1883
02:41:22,106 --> 02:41:23,232
Hey.

1884
02:41:36,220 --> 02:41:37,187
Nope.

1885
02:41:38,489 --> 02:41:40,753
Maybe I'll do better with the wine.

1886
02:41:44,295 --> 02:41:45,660
Godspeed.

1887
02:42:44,422 --> 02:42:45,719
Bloodline.

1888
02:42:49,260 --> 02:42:50,625
Rose Line.

1889
02:42:57,401 --> 02:42:59,232
"Hides beneath the Rose."

1890
02:44:58,021 --> 02:45:01,616
"The Holy Grail 'neath
ancient Roslin waits.

1891
02:45:04,694 --> 02:45:08,095
Adorned in masters'
loving art, she lies.

1892
02:45:24,147 --> 02:45:27,776
The blade and chalice
guarding o'er her gates.

1893
02:46:07,290 --> 02:46:11,090
She rests at last
beneath starry skies."
