1
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:16,353
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Quiet.</font>

2
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:19,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Open the door,
open the door.</font>

3
00:02:20,264 --> 00:02:21,555
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

4
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What in the devil?</font>

5
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:29,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you please stand up
and take us to the cash drawer, ma'am?</font>

6
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:32,614
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I will not.
- We ain't asking.</font>

7
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:34,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's no money
in the drawers yet.</font>

8
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:36,661
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's in the safe
and I ain't got the code.</font>

9
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,492
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Prove it.</font>

10
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drawer!</font>

11
00:02:40,242 --> 00:02:41,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here.</font>

12
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Open the drawer.</font>

13
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:45,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I need the keys.
- Keys.</font>

14
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:54,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Step back.</font>

15
00:02:55,591 --> 00:02:58,102
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit. Damn it!</font>

16
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Y'all are new at this,
I'm guessing.</font>

17
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:03,265
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Where's the money?
- I told you, it's in the safe.</font>

18
00:03:03,432 --> 00:03:06,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Well, who has the code?
- Mr. Clauson.</font>

19
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:09,443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He'll be here soon
and I suggest you fellers don't be.</font>

20
00:03:09,605 --> 00:03:12,225
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All you're guilty of right now
is being stupid.</font>

21
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:14,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just leave and that's all it'll be.</font>

22
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,828
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me I'm stupid again.</font>

23
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:25,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What time does Mr. Clauson get here?
Ma'am, look at me.</font>

24
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What time does
Mr. Clauson get here, huh?</font>

25
00:03:28,165 --> 00:03:29,705
<font face="Comic Sans MS">8:30 every morning.</font>

26
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're walking.</font>

27
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:38,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And sit.</font>

28
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:40,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where do you think you're going?
Sit on the floor!</font>

29
00:03:57,236 --> 00:03:58,817
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're stupid.</font>

30
00:04:08,956 --> 00:04:10,127
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This ain't about you, darling.</font>

31
00:04:17,497 --> 00:04:18,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Elsie, you all right?</font>

32
00:04:22,543 --> 00:04:24,093
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good morning.</font>

33
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You didn't have to hit him.</font>

34
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Slow down.
- I ain't speeding.</font>

35
00:04:48,944 --> 00:04:51,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See, little brother,
not a worry in the world.</font>

36
00:04:52,113 --> 00:04:54,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Planning this and doing it
is two different things.</font>

37
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe we should get there ahead,
get up to Olney.</font>

38
00:04:59,954 --> 00:05:02,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Early bird gets the worm.</font>

39
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:10,086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Slow down.
- I ain't speeding.</font>

40
00:05:32,228 --> 00:05:34,268
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I found these coins
in the barn.</font>

41
00:05:34,437 --> 00:05:36,648
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lord knows how long
they've been sitting there.</font>

42
00:05:36,816 --> 00:05:40,396
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've been living off an inmate's diet,
and had all these coins</font>

43
00:05:40,569 --> 00:05:43,278
<font face="Comic Sans MS">sitting right underneath
a bunch of feed sacks.</font>

44
00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:48,699
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- This one says 1953.
- 1953?</font>

45
00:05:48,869 --> 00:05:50,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wonder if any of these
is collector's items.</font>

46
00:05:50,995 --> 00:05:53,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You could be sitting
on a fortune here.</font>

47
00:05:53,374 --> 00:05:54,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hope so.</font>

48
00:05:54,792 --> 00:05:56,502
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good morning, folks.
Open the drawer!</font>

49
00:05:56,668 --> 00:05:58,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Open the motherfucking drawer!</font>

50
00:05:59,045 --> 00:06:01,625
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ones, 5s, 10s, 20s,
no hundreds, no bundles.</font>

51
00:06:01,798 --> 00:06:04,088
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You boys robbing the bank?
- Shut up.</font>

52
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:05,759
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put your hands on the counter.
On the counter.</font>

53
00:06:05,927 --> 00:06:07,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yes, sir.
- That's it, come on.</font>

54
00:06:08,012 --> 00:06:11,143
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's crazy.
Y'all ain't even Mexicans.</font>

55
00:06:11,307 --> 00:06:12,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh-uh, uh-uh.
No bundles.</font>

56
00:06:13,018 --> 00:06:14,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just loose cash.</font>

57
00:06:14,687 --> 00:06:15,856
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay-</font>

58
00:06:16,021 --> 00:06:17,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You ought to be
ashamed of yourselves.</font>

59
00:06:17,689 --> 00:06:19,069
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hands on the counter
where I can see them!</font>

60
00:06:19,233 --> 00:06:20,783
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, sir.</font>

61
00:06:20,942 --> 00:06:22,492
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got a gun on you, old man?</font>

62
00:06:22,653 --> 00:06:25,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're damn right
I got a gun on me.</font>

63
00:06:25,447 --> 00:06:26,617
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Are you gonna get his gun?
- Yeah.</font>

64
00:06:26,781 --> 00:06:28,411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep up with
the circumstances, okay?</font>

65
00:06:28,576 --> 00:06:31,446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah, I got it.
- So are y'all gonna steal my gun, too?</font>

66
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have my own gun.</font>

67
00:06:33,329 --> 00:06:35,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We ain't stealing from you.
We're stealing from the bank.</font>

68
00:06:36,917 --> 00:06:38,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Much obliged.</font>

69
00:06:40,754 --> 00:06:42,053
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go!</font>

70
00:06:42,213 --> 00:06:43,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry about this, folks.</font>

71
00:06:45,468 --> 00:06:47,427
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dirty, rotten sons of bitches.</font>

72
00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:51,308
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck you, old man!</font>

73
00:06:51,473 --> 00:06:53,103
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go, run, go!</font>

74
00:07:09,992 --> 00:07:12,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put the gun on the counter?
You trying to get us killed?</font>

75
00:07:12,369 --> 00:07:13,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I ain't stealing
from some old man.</font>

76
00:07:13,579 --> 00:07:15,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're stealing
from one place, that's it.</font>

77
00:07:15,788 --> 00:07:17,459
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're turning out to be
a poor-ass criminal.</font>

78
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:18,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, fuck you.</font>

79
00:07:21,377 --> 00:07:23,127
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoo!</font>

80
00:07:23,297 --> 00:07:25,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See what the early bird gets?</font>

81
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe we should hit
that branch in Jayton?</font>

82
00:07:29,136 --> 00:07:30,295
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, we ain't.
We hit those banks</font>

83
00:07:30,471 --> 00:07:32,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">first thing in the fucking morning,
when they're empty.</font>

84
00:07:32,723 --> 00:07:35,523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- When they're empty, God damn it!
- All right.</font>

85
00:07:35,683 --> 00:07:37,353
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the last time
I care to be shot at.</font>

86
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:41,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We got to be smart.
We're a ways from being finished.</font>

87
00:07:41,606 --> 00:07:43,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit, I can do this all week.</font>

88
00:07:43,526 --> 00:07:44,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're gonna.</font>

89
00:07:44,692 --> 00:07:47,452
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're like the Comanches,
little brother,</font>

90
00:07:47,612 --> 00:07:49,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">raiding wherever we please</font>

91
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:52,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with the whole of Texas
hunting our shadow.</font>

92
00:07:54,119 --> 00:07:55,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lord of the Plains.</font>

93
00:07:58,374 --> 00:07:59,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hands off.
- Fuck off!</font>

94
00:09:40,433 --> 00:09:42,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You hear about these bank robberies?</i></font>

95
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are you always
dressed like me?</font>

96
00:09:48,984 --> 00:09:50,443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is our uniform.</font>

97
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:52,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We ain't got no uniform.</font>

98
00:09:52,363 --> 00:09:54,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can wear whatever
color shirt you choose.</font>

99
00:09:54,447 --> 00:09:56,028
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You just keep choosing mine.</font>

100
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,659
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ranger regs say white,
blue, or tan dress shirts.</font>

101
00:09:58,826 --> 00:10:01,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stands to reason every once in a while
we're gonna be dressed the same.</font>

102
00:10:02,121 --> 00:10:05,461
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, you know what they say
about imitation, Alberto.</font>

103
00:10:06,751 --> 00:10:08,302
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You wanna hear
about these bank robberies,</font>

104
00:10:08,461 --> 00:10:10,422
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or you'll just sit there
and let Alzheimer's run its course?</font>

105
00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:12,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where are they at?</font>

106
00:10:12,298 --> 00:10:13,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Texas Midlands--</font>

107
00:10:13,884 --> 00:10:16,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the branch in Archer City
and the branch in Olney.</font>

108
00:10:16,636 --> 00:10:18,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">FBI want an assist?</font>

109
00:10:18,179 --> 00:10:20,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Midlands ain't got
any branches outside Texas.</font>

110
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:23,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Plus, they're just hitting the drawers
for a few thousand.</font>

111
00:10:23,686 --> 00:10:25,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">FBI don't want it.</font>

112
00:10:28,481 --> 00:10:29,572
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You may get to have some fun</font>

113
00:10:29,732 --> 00:10:31,942
<font face="Comic Sans MS">before they send you off
to the rocking chair yet.</font>

114
00:10:52,297 --> 00:10:54,297
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need you sober.</font>

115
00:10:54,466 --> 00:10:55,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who the hell gets drunk
off a beer?</font>

116
00:11:01,389 --> 00:11:03,139
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Place looks like shit.</font>

117
00:11:03,307 --> 00:11:04,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got anything else
you wanna say?</font>

118
00:11:04,976 --> 00:11:07,057
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's not a decent steak</font>

119
00:11:07,229 --> 00:11:09,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in the whole lot
of them sorry sons of bitches.</font>

120
00:11:09,856 --> 00:11:11,647
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, well,
while you were busy in jail,</font>

121
00:11:11,817 --> 00:11:12,817
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was busy looking after Mama,</font>

122
00:11:12,985 --> 00:11:14,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so you can go fuck yourself.</font>

123
00:11:25,748 --> 00:11:27,248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Was she in that bed awhile?</font>

124
00:11:31,253 --> 00:11:32,302
<font face="Comic Sans MS">3 months.</font>

125
00:11:48,312 --> 00:11:50,022
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The end there was pretty rough.</font>

126
00:11:53,649 --> 00:11:55,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I could've helped out a little
if she asked.</font>

127
00:11:57,278 --> 00:11:59,698
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I could've fed
them skinny cows.</font>

128
00:12:02,408 --> 00:12:04,578
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We had nothing to feed them.</font>

129
00:12:04,745 --> 00:12:07,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I could've helped clean up
the house a bit.</font>

130
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:12,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Never took you for the go-to guy
for house cleaning.</font>

131
00:12:13,003 --> 00:12:16,133
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. Just robbing banks.</font>

132
00:12:16,298 --> 00:12:17,548
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know.</font>

133
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck her.</font>

134
00:12:32,188 --> 00:12:34,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She never wanted nothing
to do with me anyway.</font>

135
00:12:44,618 --> 00:12:45,738
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She leave a will?</font>

136
00:12:49,206 --> 00:12:50,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

137
00:12:51,707 --> 00:12:52,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Am I in it?</font>

138
00:12:59,633 --> 00:13:00,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The will don't matter.</font>

139
00:13:02,927 --> 00:13:06,057
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She left everything to me.
By Friday it all goes to my boys.</font>

140
00:13:09,976 --> 00:13:11,307
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She didn't mean nothing by it.</font>

141
00:13:12,645 --> 00:13:14,306
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She damn sure meant it.</font>

142
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She always hated me
for standing up to him.</font>

143
00:13:17,484 --> 00:13:19,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>We all got punished.</i></font>

144
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You never understood that fighting back
makes the beating last longer.</font>

145
00:13:23,282 --> 00:13:25,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I understood.</font>

146
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:28,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's why I stopped fighting
and shot that son of a bitch.</font>

147
00:14:33,644 --> 00:14:36,774
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, what's going on?</font>

148
00:14:36,938 --> 00:14:38,568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Somebody robbed
the bank this morning.</font>

149
00:14:38,731 --> 00:14:39,782
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do what?</font>

150
00:14:39,942 --> 00:14:41,861
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you see anyone
looking a little sideways,</font>

151
00:14:42,027 --> 00:14:43,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">give me a call.</font>

152
00:14:43,486 --> 00:14:45,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sideways don't wanna meet me.</font>

153
00:14:45,322 --> 00:14:47,662
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Find itself on the wrong end
of a short rope.</font>

154
00:14:47,823 --> 00:14:51,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, well, that would simplify things
for everyone but you.</font>

155
00:14:51,912 --> 00:14:55,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe,
if you can find the tree.</font>

156
00:14:58,293 --> 00:15:01,003
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God, I love West Texas.</font>

157
00:15:04,633 --> 00:15:06,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Ranger.
- Hi there.</font>

158
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:08,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wasn't much of a robbery.</font>

159
00:15:08,803 --> 00:15:10,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Got off with just under $7,000.</font>

160
00:15:10,889 --> 00:15:14,769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Took the drawer money,
20s and under, only loose bills.</font>

161
00:15:14,934 --> 00:15:16,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No ink pack?
- Nope.</font>

162
00:15:16,644 --> 00:15:18,304
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Smart.
- That was smart.</font>

163
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can we get a look
at the video?</font>

164
00:15:20,565 --> 00:15:23,565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me introduce you
to the bank manager, Mr. Clauson.</font>

165
00:15:26,363 --> 00:15:28,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This here is Ranger Hamilton.</font>

166
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Ranger.
- Sir.</font>

167
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:32,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can we get a look
at the surveillance video?</font>

168
00:15:32,661 --> 00:15:35,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We got cameras, but they're
switching us over to a digital system</font>

169
00:15:36,038 --> 00:15:37,288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that feeds into the computer.</font>

170
00:15:37,456 --> 00:15:40,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These new cameras
don't hook to our VCRs.</font>

171
00:15:40,293 --> 00:15:42,092
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Call over
the Young County Sheriffs.</font>

172
00:15:42,254 --> 00:15:44,303
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ask them if they thought
to hook their cameras</font>

173
00:15:44,463 --> 00:15:46,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to some sort of
recording device.</font>

174
00:15:48,884 --> 00:15:51,044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Armed?
- Yes, sir. Pistols.</font>

175
00:15:51,221 --> 00:15:52,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh.</font>

176
00:15:53,597 --> 00:15:54,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Faces covered?</font>

177
00:15:54,975 --> 00:15:57,845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ski masks, sweatshirts,
baggy pants...</font>

178
00:15:58,019 --> 00:15:59,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Uh-huh.
- Like them thugs in Dallas.</font>

179
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:01,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tweakers, maybe?</font>

180
00:16:01,313 --> 00:16:02,403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe.</font>

181
00:16:02,566 --> 00:16:05,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A little early in the morning
for tweakers.</font>

182
00:16:05,568 --> 00:16:08,528
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tweakers don't sleep.
They just tweak.</font>

183
00:16:08,697 --> 00:16:12,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They rob drug stores
and parked cars, not banks.</font>

184
00:16:12,283 --> 00:16:13,494
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can I take a look inside?</font>

185
00:16:13,659 --> 00:16:14,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, sir.</font>

186
00:16:15,037 --> 00:16:16,537
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I'm here, Margaret.</font>

187
00:16:16,705 --> 00:16:18,664
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So they bopped you
in the snozzola, huh?</font>

188
00:16:18,831 --> 00:16:20,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, sir.</font>

189
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:22,249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not very nice.</font>

190
00:16:24,129 --> 00:16:28,178
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know their faces was covered,
but could you tell their race?</font>

191
00:16:28,341 --> 00:16:30,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Black, white?</font>

192
00:16:30,594 --> 00:16:33,224
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Their skin or their souls?</font>

193
00:16:33,388 --> 00:16:36,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's leave their souls
out of this for now.</font>

194
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">White.</font>

195
00:16:38,434 --> 00:16:41,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">From around here somewhere
is my guess,</font>

196
00:16:41,812 --> 00:16:43,572
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you know, from their voices.</font>

197
00:16:43,731 --> 00:16:44,981
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh?</font>

198
00:16:45,149 --> 00:16:47,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Young County says same deal
with the branch in Olney.</i></font>

199
00:16:47,568 --> 00:16:48,698
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me.</font>

200
00:16:50,739 --> 00:16:51,908
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do they have video?</font>

201
00:16:52,073 --> 00:16:53,494
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Same deal all the way around.</font>

202
00:16:54,743 --> 00:16:58,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Doesn't Walmart sell all sorts
of electronic equipment?</font>

203
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:00,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My word.
Get your hands off that.</font>

204
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:06,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, these boys, they aren't done yet,
I'll tell you that.</font>

205
00:17:06,587 --> 00:17:08,337
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How come?
- Well, they're patient.</font>

206
00:17:08,507 --> 00:17:12,217
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're just sticking to the drawers,
not taking the hundreds.</font>

207
00:17:12,384 --> 00:17:14,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's the bank's money.
We can trace that.</font>

208
00:17:14,846 --> 00:17:17,215
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're trying to raise
a certain amount.</font>

209
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:18,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's my guess.</font>

210
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:21,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's gonna take
a few banks to get there.</font>

211
00:17:34,865 --> 00:17:36,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your boys know how rich
they're gonna be?</font>

212
00:17:39,496 --> 00:17:40,905
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They don't know anything yet.</font>

213
00:17:42,999 --> 00:17:44,459
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You take them to the funeral?</font>

214
00:17:47,086 --> 00:17:48,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like I said,
they don't know anything.</font>

215
00:17:52,717 --> 00:17:54,297
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When's the last time
you saw them?</font>

216
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:01,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When we all went to the rodeo
in Stamford right after you got out.</font>

217
00:18:04,061 --> 00:18:06,942
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That was a year ago.
- I talk to them on the phone.</font>

218
00:18:07,106 --> 00:18:08,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You talk to them on the phone?</font>

219
00:18:12,153 --> 00:18:14,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You want a little advice?
- No. No, I don't.</font>

220
00:18:15,073 --> 00:18:16,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go see them tomorrow.</font>

221
00:18:20,036 --> 00:18:22,955
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got any idea how much
I owe Debbie in child support?</font>

222
00:18:23,123 --> 00:18:25,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've got enough in your front pocket
to fix that problem right now.</font>

223
00:18:28,252 --> 00:18:29,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can't spare it,
you know that.</font>

224
00:18:31,338 --> 00:18:33,088
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe we should hit
another branch.</font>

225
00:18:37,761 --> 00:18:41,102
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, you talk like
we ain't gonna get away with this.</font>

226
00:18:41,266 --> 00:18:45,056
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've never met nobody who got away
with anything, ever.</font>

227
00:18:45,228 --> 00:18:46,478
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You?</font>

228
00:18:50,482 --> 00:18:52,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then why in the hell
did you agree to do it?</font>

229
00:18:53,987 --> 00:18:55,487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because you asked,
little brother.</font>

230
00:19:03,454 --> 00:19:05,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got to shit like an old goat.</font>

231
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:08,212
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Grab the check,
meet me out front.</font>

232
00:19:15,967 --> 00:19:18,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, if that isn't a hint,
I don't know what is.</font>

233
00:19:23,307 --> 00:19:25,847
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You like your steak?
- Yes, ma'am.</font>

234
00:19:26,019 --> 00:19:27,939
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, you've got
a ways to go yet.</font>

235
00:19:29,146 --> 00:19:32,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, you'll be waiting around all day
for me to finish this.</font>

236
00:19:32,608 --> 00:19:36,148
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll be here whether
you finish it or not, so...</font>

237
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,701
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you take your time.</font>

238
00:19:46,248 --> 00:19:47,538
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure is quiet in here.</font>

239
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:51,375
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Open the drawer.
5s, 10s, 20s.</font>

240
00:19:51,544 --> 00:19:53,263
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fan them out
like a deck of cards.</font>

241
00:19:54,798 --> 00:19:56,258
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you do?</font>

242
00:20:01,179 --> 00:20:03,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Last job was for a...</font>

243
00:20:03,847 --> 00:20:05,728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">natural gas company.</font>

244
00:20:07,184 --> 00:20:08,265
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sounds high-dollar.</font>

245
00:20:09,688 --> 00:20:12,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, there ain't nothing
high-dollar about drilling.</font>

246
00:20:12,691 --> 00:20:14,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No one seems to be
drilling for gas now, anyway.</font>

247
00:20:14,984 --> 00:20:17,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're sure drilling for oil.</font>

248
00:20:17,528 --> 00:20:19,568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, ain't one drill
the same as the next?</font>

249
00:20:22,075 --> 00:20:23,575
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's my take on it.</font>

250
00:20:24,702 --> 00:20:26,413
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guess I got to get
someone else to believe me.</font>

251
00:20:26,578 --> 00:20:28,459
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Son of a bitch!</i></font>

252
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:31,842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We could use a cook.</font>

253
00:20:37,298 --> 00:20:38,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just a thought.</font>

254
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Order's up, Jenny Ann.</i></font>

255
00:20:47,433 --> 00:20:48,483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bye.</font>

256
00:21:10,164 --> 00:21:11,785
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Start the car!</font>

257
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:13,127
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit!</font>

258
00:21:18,673 --> 00:21:20,432
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck! Shit!</font>

259
00:21:20,592 --> 00:21:21,892
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go, go, go!</font>

260
00:21:39,318 --> 00:21:41,858
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I bet you don't owe this much
in child support.</font>

261
00:21:42,905 --> 00:21:44,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I must be out of my goddamn mind
to ask you for help.</font>

262
00:21:46,701 --> 00:21:49,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You wanna get us killed?!
Huh?!</font>

263
00:21:49,703 --> 00:21:52,584
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not a Midlands Branch.
That's not part of the plan.</font>

264
00:21:52,749 --> 00:21:54,578
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, we got to go back to the ranch
and bury the car.</font>

265
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:55,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Fuck!
- No, we do not.</font>

266
00:21:56,086 --> 00:21:57,415
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're over halfway to Oklahoma.</font>

267
00:21:57,586 --> 00:22:01,666
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not driving a stolen getaway car
to a fucking Indian casino.</font>

268
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You just put us
a goddamn day behind.</font>

269
00:22:03,384 --> 00:22:06,295
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I got us a day ahead
this morning, so I guess we're even.</font>

270
00:22:06,471 --> 00:22:08,101
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You're welcome.
- Fuck you.</font>

271
00:22:17,898 --> 00:22:19,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can't you answer
your own phone?</font>

272
00:22:19,651 --> 00:22:22,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm driving. You're just sitting there
twiddling your fat fingers.</font>

273
00:22:24,446 --> 00:22:26,027
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ranger Hamilton's phone.</font>

274
00:23:09,284 --> 00:23:10,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's reckless is what it is.</font>

275
00:23:11,035 --> 00:23:12,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's tweakers, I'm telling you.</font>

276
00:23:12,287 --> 00:23:13,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think these boys
is reckless.</font>

277
00:23:14,122 --> 00:23:16,211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn sure ain't tweakers.</font>

278
00:23:16,374 --> 00:23:18,384
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They know exactly
what they're doing.</font>

279
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:23,378
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know how you're gonna survive
without somebody to outsmart.</font>

280
00:23:24,632 --> 00:23:26,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You need a hobby, and quick.</font>

281
00:23:27,844 --> 00:23:29,013
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How about a horse?</font>

282
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:32,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mary Beth was the rider.</font>

283
00:23:34,183 --> 00:23:36,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A horse would only
remind me of her.</font>

284
00:23:38,313 --> 00:23:39,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You like to fish.</font>

285
00:23:41,732 --> 00:23:44,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not enough to do it
every goddamn day.</font>

286
00:23:45,612 --> 00:23:47,451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, when I retire,</font>

287
00:23:47,614 --> 00:23:50,663
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna move Esme and me
down to Galveston.</font>

288
00:23:50,825 --> 00:23:52,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Buy a fishing boat.</font>

289
00:23:52,285 --> 00:23:54,944
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gonna live on that son of a bitch
right at the pier.</font>

290
00:23:55,121 --> 00:23:57,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, who knows?</font>

291
00:23:57,999 --> 00:24:01,459
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe one of these bank robbers
is gonna want a gunfight</font>

292
00:24:01,627 --> 00:24:05,468
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I can dodge my retirement
in a blaze of glory.</font>

293
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:07,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I've seen you shoot.</font>

294
00:24:07,674 --> 00:24:09,255
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There won't be much glory in it.</font>

295
00:24:11,221 --> 00:24:13,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, well, I'm lucky</font>

296
00:24:13,388 --> 00:24:16,388
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got a half-breed by my side
to avenge me.</font>

297
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:20,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you can stay sober
long enough,</font>

298
00:24:20,438 --> 00:24:23,188
<font face="Comic Sans MS">knowing how you lnjuns
like the bottle.</font>

299
00:24:30,405 --> 00:24:32,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa.</font>

300
00:24:40,541 --> 00:24:42,342
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

301
00:24:42,501 --> 00:24:44,501
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What you all doing?
You burning this field?</font>

302
00:24:44,671 --> 00:24:46,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why in the shit
would we do that?</font>

303
00:24:46,256 --> 00:24:48,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This kicked up on the highway,
been chasing us ever since.</font>

304
00:24:49,008 --> 00:24:51,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wish we could do
something for you.</font>

305
00:24:51,301 --> 00:24:53,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ought to just let it turn me to ashes,
put me out of my misery.</font>

306
00:24:53,512 --> 00:24:55,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cut that fence.</font>

307
00:24:55,472 --> 00:24:59,063
<font face="Comic Sans MS">21st century, I'm racing a fire
to the river with a herd of cattle.</font>

308
00:24:59,227 --> 00:25:01,936
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I wonder why my kids
won't do this shit for a living.</font>

309
00:25:02,105 --> 00:25:04,065
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move 'em out.
Come on.</font>

310
00:25:04,231 --> 00:25:05,612
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go, go! go-</font>

311
00:25:08,611 --> 00:25:10,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You wanna call it in?</font>

312
00:25:10,738 --> 00:25:13,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, it's gonna burn out
when it hits the Brazos.</font>

313
00:25:14,701 --> 00:25:17,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No one to call
around here, anyway.</font>

314
00:25:17,787 --> 00:25:19,906
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, these boys is on their own.</font>

315
00:25:29,339 --> 00:25:30,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I still don't see the problem, Toby.</font>

316
00:25:30,592 --> 00:25:31,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You still don't...</font>

317
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:32,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, the problem is,
thanks to you,</font>

318
00:25:33,051 --> 00:25:34,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we have to spend tomorrow morning
getting another car,</font>

319
00:25:34,929 --> 00:25:36,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so we'll have to hit two banks
on Wednesday.</font>

320
00:25:36,888 --> 00:25:38,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We already done three today.</font>

321
00:25:39,017 --> 00:25:40,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop worrying.</font>

322
00:25:43,688 --> 00:25:44,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whose land is this?</font>

323
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jeremy Chalker.</font>

324
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:52,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He lets me stay here in exchange
for shooting coyotes.</font>

325
00:25:58,243 --> 00:25:59,503
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cold beer in the fridge.</font>

326
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You stole my hat.</font>

327
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:20,099
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I borrowed it.</font>

328
00:26:20,266 --> 00:26:21,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the fuck you do to it?</font>

329
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:37,779
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What's this?
- My livelihood.</font>

330
00:26:39,576 --> 00:26:40,787
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We don't need all this.</font>

331
00:26:40,952 --> 00:26:43,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can't keep the guns
in the trailer days on end.</font>

332
00:26:43,748 --> 00:26:45,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not coming with us
in the bank.</font>

333
00:26:49,336 --> 00:26:50,626
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just spoke to the teller.</font>

334
00:26:50,797 --> 00:26:51,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's a little shook up.</font>

335
00:26:52,131 --> 00:26:53,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perp took her driver's license,</font>

336
00:26:53,465 --> 00:26:55,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">threatened her family
if she talked to us.</font>

337
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,309
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mind if I ask you
your name, young lady?</font>

338
00:27:00,472 --> 00:27:02,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Natalie Martinez.</font>

339
00:27:02,392 --> 00:27:04,811
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, Natalie,
I want you to know</font>

340
00:27:04,977 --> 00:27:07,936
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we're gonna have some officers
watching your house extra careful</font>

341
00:27:08,105 --> 00:27:09,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">till we catch these buggers.</font>

342
00:27:09,523 --> 00:27:11,693
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have my word on that.</font>

343
00:27:11,858 --> 00:27:13,189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's more than one?</font>

344
00:27:14,278 --> 00:27:16,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only one man robbed the bank?</font>

345
00:27:16,571 --> 00:27:18,372
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah.
- What'd he look like?</font>

346
00:27:18,532 --> 00:27:22,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was dressed like a cowpoke
except for the ski mask.</font>

347
00:27:23,954 --> 00:27:27,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think he ran to a car
that was parked out front of the diner.</font>

348
00:27:28,084 --> 00:27:29,923
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You saw the car?</font>

349
00:27:30,086 --> 00:27:32,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was green.</font>

350
00:27:32,212 --> 00:27:34,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How old?
- I don't know cars, mister.</font>

351
00:27:34,882 --> 00:27:38,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, was it a nice car,
an okay car,</font>

352
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or a real piece of shit?</font>

353
00:27:41,638 --> 00:27:42,929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was a real piece of shit.</font>

354
00:27:43,098 --> 00:27:45,388
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.
Now, we're getting somewhere.</font>

355
00:27:46,769 --> 00:27:49,648
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, that looks like a man
who could foreclose on a house.</font>

356
00:27:49,814 --> 00:27:51,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me, Natalie.</font>

357
00:27:51,398 --> 00:27:52,979
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me, Mr. Banker.</font>

358
00:27:53,151 --> 00:27:55,701
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Natalie, I'm gonna have the officer
stay with you till your father arrives.</font>

359
00:27:55,862 --> 00:27:56,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- All right?
- Okay.</font>

360
00:27:57,154 --> 00:27:59,865
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Didn't happen to have your surveillance
cameras on this morning, did you?</font>

361
00:28:00,031 --> 00:28:01,122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course.</font>

362
00:28:01,284 --> 00:28:03,203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, so you have
the robbery on video.</font>

363
00:28:03,368 --> 00:28:04,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course we do.</font>

364
00:28:04,578 --> 00:28:07,288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What kind of bank would we be
if we didn't have video surveillance?</font>

365
00:28:07,457 --> 00:28:10,537
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, you'd be
a Texas Midlands Bank.</font>

366
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:12,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, we've got video.</font>

367
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:15,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Care to give it a watch
while I wander over to the burger joint?</font>

368
00:28:15,964 --> 00:28:17,335
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Would you order me something
while you're there?</font>

369
00:28:17,508 --> 00:28:20,387
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm starving.
- I doubt they serve pemmican.</font>

370
00:28:20,553 --> 00:28:22,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know
I'm part Mexican, too.</font>

371
00:28:22,637 --> 00:28:24,387
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, well,
I'm gonna get to that</font>

372
00:28:24,557 --> 00:28:26,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when I'm through
with the Indian insults,</font>

373
00:28:27,101 --> 00:28:28,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but it's gonna be a while.</font>

374
00:28:31,021 --> 00:28:33,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You rangers are an odd bunch.</font>

375
00:28:33,356 --> 00:28:36,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, just him.</font>

376
00:28:36,402 --> 00:28:37,652
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's take a look at that video.</font>

377
00:28:37,819 --> 00:28:39,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, it's right back here.</font>

378
00:28:49,874 --> 00:28:51,334
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Howdy.</font>

379
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ma'am.</font>

380
00:28:52,876 --> 00:28:55,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guess you know about
the goings-on at the bank.</font>

381
00:28:55,587 --> 00:28:56,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I did notice.</font>

382
00:28:56,838 --> 00:28:59,088
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Any out-of-towners
come through today?</font>

383
00:29:00,092 --> 00:29:03,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jenny Ann waited on a couple of boys,
ain't from here.</font>

384
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:04,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh?</font>

385
00:29:04,888 --> 00:29:06,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll go get her.</font>

386
00:29:06,641 --> 00:29:07,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Appreciate that.</font>

387
00:29:11,979 --> 00:29:13,729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Boys.</font>

388
00:29:13,897 --> 00:29:15,817
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Y'all been here for a while?</font>

389
00:29:15,982 --> 00:29:17,903
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, long enough to watch
a bank getting robbed</font>

390
00:29:18,068 --> 00:29:21,108
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that's been robbing me
for 30 years.</font>

391
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:22,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, you say you've seen them?</font>

392
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:28,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm pretty sure they were sitting
right over there having lunch.</font>

393
00:29:28,162 --> 00:29:29,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One of them was tall.</font>

394
00:29:29,997 --> 00:29:32,457
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The other one was short.</font>

395
00:29:34,085 --> 00:29:36,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They's both lean like cowboys.</font>

396
00:29:36,378 --> 00:29:38,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Looked like brothers
if you ask me.</font>

397
00:29:39,048 --> 00:29:40,968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You the Texas Ranger?</font>

398
00:29:41,133 --> 00:29:43,012
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, ma'am.</font>

399
00:29:43,176 --> 00:29:46,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me about those handsome
young strangers that you waited on.</font>

400
00:29:48,307 --> 00:29:49,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who said handsome?</font>

401
00:29:50,058 --> 00:29:51,229
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I did.</font>

402
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:54,901
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Based on the fact that you didn't
meet me in the parking lot,</font>

403
00:29:55,064 --> 00:29:56,693
<font face="Comic Sans MS">hollering about
the two out-of-towners</font>

404
00:29:56,857 --> 00:29:59,028
<font face="Comic Sans MS">eating here
right before a bank robbery.</font>

405
00:30:01,863 --> 00:30:03,613
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, they didn't mention
they was robbing the bank.</font>

406
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:04,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They paid cash?</font>

407
00:30:06,241 --> 00:30:07,582
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That a crime now?</font>

408
00:30:10,954 --> 00:30:12,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How much did they leave?</font>

409
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:16,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How much?</font>

410
00:30:17,961 --> 00:30:19,551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">$200.</font>

411
00:30:19,713 --> 00:30:23,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And they left it before
the bank was robbed, so...</font>

412
00:30:23,593 --> 00:30:26,012
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, before this bank
was robbed.</font>

413
00:30:27,637 --> 00:30:29,307
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna need
to see them bills.</font>

414
00:30:33,603 --> 00:30:35,353
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Ma'am.
- Mm-mm.</font>

415
00:30:36,646 --> 00:30:39,227
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ma'am, them bills is evidence.</font>

416
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,779
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mm-mm, it's evidence
if they're the bank robbers.</font>

417
00:30:41,943 --> 00:30:44,864
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Till then, it's my tip.</font>

418
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:47,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And half my mortgage.</font>

419
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, you go out there
and you get a warrant,</font>

420
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:49,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you come after the money</font>

421
00:30:50,076 --> 00:30:52,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that I will be using to keep a roof
over my daughter's head.</font>

422
00:30:57,250 --> 00:31:00,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One man hit the bank,
just like she said.</font>

423
00:31:00,712 --> 00:31:02,303
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah.
- Checkered button-down shirt,</font>

424
00:31:02,464 --> 00:31:03,835
<font face="Comic Sans MS">jeans, ski mask.</font>

425
00:31:04,008 --> 00:31:05,218
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That's all the video will tell us.
- Yep. Yep.</font>

426
00:31:05,384 --> 00:31:08,263
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Checkered shirt.
That is him.</font>

427
00:31:08,429 --> 00:31:12,179
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They were sitting right over there.
Tipped her $200.</font>

428
00:31:13,808 --> 00:31:16,598
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go wrestle a description</font>

429
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:19,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">from that big sassy girl
in the kitchen.</font>

430
00:31:19,315 --> 00:31:20,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You didn't get it yourself?</font>

431
00:31:20,566 --> 00:31:24,145
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, and get that tip from her.
We're gonna check them bills.</font>

432
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:25,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good luck.</font>

433
00:31:25,695 --> 00:31:28,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I'd expect some resistance.</font>

434
00:31:28,657 --> 00:31:30,827
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, and, Alberto,</font>

435
00:31:30,992 --> 00:31:35,373
<font face="Comic Sans MS">call that motel on 287,
get us a room.</font>

436
00:31:35,538 --> 00:31:36,578
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're gonna stay the night?</font>

437
00:31:36,749 --> 00:31:38,288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, this is where the action is.</font>

438
00:31:40,211 --> 00:31:41,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Seems foolish.</font>

439
00:31:41,711 --> 00:31:43,132
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's that?</font>

440
00:31:43,297 --> 00:31:46,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The days of robbing banks
and trying to live to spend the money...</font>

441
00:31:48,385 --> 00:31:49,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they're long gone.</font>

442
00:31:50,637 --> 00:31:52,177
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Long gone for sure.</font>

443
00:32:01,022 --> 00:32:02,823
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What does Justin want to do
when he's grown?</font>

444
00:32:05,361 --> 00:32:07,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right now he's dreaming
of slinging a football for A&M.</font>

445
00:32:13,618 --> 00:32:14,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's a lot like you.</font>

446
00:32:15,037 --> 00:32:18,537
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I bet that puckers your red eye.
- More than you know.</font>

447
00:32:21,042 --> 00:32:24,212
<font face="Comic Sans MS">39 years of life, 10 in jail.</font>

448
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:27,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If he turn left where I turned right,
he'll be okay.</font>

449
00:32:34,515 --> 00:32:37,974
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let the world call me a fool</font>

450
00:32:39,394 --> 00:32:42,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Things are right with me and you</font>

451
00:32:44,442 --> 00:32:45,442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yaw.</font>

452
00:32:47,569 --> 00:32:49,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yaw.</font>

453
00:33:04,545 --> 00:33:05,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want anything?</font>

454
00:33:05,921 --> 00:33:07,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Pepper, Winston Lights.</font>

455
00:33:11,719 --> 00:33:13,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay.
Come on.</font>

456
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:26,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

457
00:33:29,153 --> 00:33:30,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What, bitch?</font>

458
00:33:32,573 --> 00:33:35,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You looking for trouble,
motherfucker?</font>

459
00:33:35,201 --> 00:33:37,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You came to the right place.</font>

460
00:33:37,286 --> 00:33:40,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Boy, you'd think
there were 10 of me.</font>

461
00:33:41,539 --> 00:33:42,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah?</font>

462
00:33:45,586 --> 00:33:48,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not so fucking tough now,
are you, bitch?</font>

463
00:34:03,269 --> 00:34:04,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, man, he had it coming.</font>

464
00:34:04,563 --> 00:34:06,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He had it coming.
He had it coming.</font>

465
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:15,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got some spunk left in you.</font>

466
00:34:16,492 --> 00:34:18,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, you remembered the gun.</font>

467
00:34:18,786 --> 00:34:21,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're getting
to be old hat at this.</font>

468
00:34:30,463 --> 00:34:32,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Asshole could've killed you.</font>

469
00:34:32,632 --> 00:34:35,143
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah, not the way it would
have gone, little brother.</font>

470
00:34:39,097 --> 00:34:42,018
<font face="Comic Sans MS">10 of me, I told you!</font>

471
00:34:43,936 --> 00:34:44,976
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you trying to make me mad?</font>

472
00:34:45,146 --> 00:34:47,056
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I said Dr. Pepper.
This is Mr. Pibb.</font>

473
00:34:47,231 --> 00:34:48,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's all they had.</font>

474
00:34:48,398 --> 00:34:50,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only assholes drink Mr. Pibb.</font>

475
00:34:50,483 --> 00:34:51,653
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drink up.</font>

476
00:35:02,913 --> 00:35:03,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello.</font>

477
00:35:20,472 --> 00:35:21,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

478
00:35:25,186 --> 00:35:26,306
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now we're talking.</font>

479
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The women in this place.</font>

480
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:34,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>What the hell you talking about?</i></font>

481
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:36,739
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We should get another shot.
They'll be pretty soon enough.</font>

482
00:35:36,905 --> 00:35:39,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bartender,
whiskeys if you please.</font>

483
00:35:39,532 --> 00:35:40,663
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Coming up-</font>

484
00:35:45,206 --> 00:35:46,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To your boys.</font>

485
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go change that money.</font>

486
00:36:05,141 --> 00:36:07,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry.
I just sold my car.</font>

487
00:36:07,393 --> 00:36:08,653
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is how the fella paid me.</font>

488
00:36:08,811 --> 00:36:10,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We take it any way
you bring it, mister.</font>

489
00:36:23,534 --> 00:36:25,405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wanna play some poker?</font>

490
00:36:25,579 --> 00:36:26,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't gamble.</font>

491
00:36:26,746 --> 00:36:28,496
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't lose at poker,
not even you.</font>

492
00:36:29,791 --> 00:36:31,922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna watch the Aggie game
and have a beer.</font>

493
00:36:32,085 --> 00:36:33,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, suit yourself.</font>

494
00:36:35,088 --> 00:36:36,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, now.</font>

495
00:36:36,632 --> 00:36:38,181
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Suck a D.</font>

496
00:36:38,342 --> 00:36:39,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't lose it all.</font>

497
00:36:39,842 --> 00:36:41,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Eat my A!</i></font>

498
00:36:41,929 --> 00:36:43,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fucking asshole.</font>

499
00:37:40,528 --> 00:37:43,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's, uh--
that's quite a stack.</font>

500
00:37:53,789 --> 00:37:54,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Check?</font>

501
00:37:55,123 --> 00:37:56,463
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't chase me, chief.</font>

502
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You Comanche?</font>

503
00:38:14,927 --> 00:38:16,507
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lords of the Plains.</font>

504
00:38:17,512 --> 00:38:19,103
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lords of Nothing now.</font>

505
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,349
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I call.</font>

506
00:38:31,811 --> 00:38:33,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Show your cards, gentlemen.</font>

507
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:48,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you know
what Comanche means?</font>

508
00:38:51,121 --> 00:38:53,501
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It means enemies forever.</font>

509
00:38:53,666 --> 00:38:55,286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Enemies with who?</font>

510
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:57,338
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone.</font>

511
00:38:57,503 --> 00:38:59,262
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what that makes me?</font>

512
00:38:59,422 --> 00:39:00,422
<font face="Comic Sans MS">An enemy.</font>

513
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:02,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

514
00:39:02,632 --> 00:39:04,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It makes me a Comanche.</font>

515
00:39:14,347 --> 00:39:15,717
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Does he look like you?</font>

516
00:39:16,724 --> 00:39:17,934
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see his mom in him.</font>

517
00:39:19,144 --> 00:39:20,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everybody else sees me.</font>

518
00:39:22,188 --> 00:39:23,228
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.</font>

519
00:39:28,403 --> 00:39:30,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You staying in the hotel?</font>

520
00:39:34,201 --> 00:39:35,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

521
00:39:37,413 --> 00:39:40,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take me to your room.</font>

522
00:39:45,795 --> 00:39:47,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.
Just, uh...</font>

523
00:39:48,215 --> 00:39:51,795
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's no shame
in needing the touch of a woman.</font>

524
00:39:54,804 --> 00:39:56,344
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You need it.</font>

525
00:39:57,432 --> 00:39:58,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know you do.</font>

526
00:40:00,436 --> 00:40:02,646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just let me touch you.</font>

527
00:40:03,646 --> 00:40:05,646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Trying to work my little brother?</font>

528
00:40:05,815 --> 00:40:07,606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, I wasn't doing anything, but I...
- Tanner, she didn't do nothin'.</font>

529
00:40:07,775 --> 00:40:09,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- She didn't do nothin'.
- But, but, but, but, but...</font>

530
00:40:09,652 --> 00:40:11,452
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You saw there was
a stack of chips here.</font>

531
00:40:11,614 --> 00:40:12,664
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Don't.
- Easy mark?</font>

532
00:40:12,822 --> 00:40:14,702
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Uh... no.
- What were you gonna do?</font>

533
00:40:14,867 --> 00:40:16,827
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bring him up to his room,
call your pimp,</font>

534
00:40:16,994 --> 00:40:18,043
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- roll him, drug him, what?
- No. I...</font>

535
00:40:18,204 --> 00:40:19,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What were you gonna do?
- Tanner, no.</font>

536
00:40:19,871 --> 00:40:21,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mind if I sample the goods?
Real fuckin'...</font>

537
00:40:21,873 --> 00:40:25,884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hands off. Stop it.
Stop it.</font>

538
00:40:31,509 --> 00:40:33,298
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You're fucking crazy!
- Call me.</font>

539
00:40:33,469 --> 00:40:34,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>We got a problem here?</i></font>

540
00:40:34,637 --> 00:40:36,257
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's all good.
- It's all good.</font>

541
00:40:36,429 --> 00:40:38,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's all good.
Just got a little drunk at the bar.</font>

542
00:40:38,724 --> 00:40:39,893
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry about that.</font>

543
00:40:43,353 --> 00:40:46,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How the fuck have you managed
to stay out of prison for a year?</font>

544
00:40:46,481 --> 00:40:47,731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's been difficult.</font>

545
00:40:52,612 --> 00:40:54,742
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like to pay this out
in cash or check?</font>

546
00:40:54,907 --> 00:40:56,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get some Debbie money.</font>

547
00:40:57,534 --> 00:41:00,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">4 in cash, rest in check.</font>

548
00:41:01,621 --> 00:41:03,211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who would you like
the check made out to?</font>

549
00:41:05,291 --> 00:41:06,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Texas Midlands Bank.</font>

550
00:41:15,427 --> 00:41:16,507
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you much.</font>

551
00:41:17,762 --> 00:41:19,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go get a room.</font>

552
00:41:30,568 --> 00:41:33,108
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Welcome to the Comanche 66.
Do you have a reservation?</font>

553
00:41:33,278 --> 00:41:34,858
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We do not.</font>

554
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:38,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good Lord, look at you.</font>

555
00:41:39,534 --> 00:41:41,905
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We would be obliged if you
would provide accommodations,</font>

556
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:44,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">though we failed to call ahead.</font>

557
00:41:44,331 --> 00:41:46,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Boy, you are trouble.</font>

558
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm the worst kind, darling.</font>

559
00:41:47,835 --> 00:41:52,715
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In your last days in the nursing home,
you'll think of me and giggle.</font>

560
00:41:57,844 --> 00:42:00,505
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Why, God?
Why won't you answer my prayers?</i></font>

561
00:42:00,681 --> 00:42:02,141
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You begged him for help,</i></font>

562
00:42:02,307 --> 00:42:04,728
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>and yet you look around at your life
and nothing is different.</i></font>

563
00:42:04,893 --> 00:42:08,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And so you assume
that God has told you no.</i></font>

564
00:42:09,523 --> 00:42:12,112
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God doesn't say no.</font>

565
00:42:12,275 --> 00:42:14,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why couldn't we drive back
to Lubbock?</font>

566
00:42:14,652 --> 00:42:16,822
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Cause they ain't robbing banks
in Lubbock.</font>

567
00:42:17,822 --> 00:42:19,663
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're not gonna watch this,
are we?</font>

568
00:42:21,784 --> 00:42:23,534
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ain't you Christian?</font>

569
00:42:23,704 --> 00:42:25,253
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, but I ain't stupid.</font>

570
00:42:25,414 --> 00:42:28,463
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God doesn't talk through this man
any more than he talks through my dog.</font>

571
00:42:28,626 --> 00:42:31,335
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, then maybe you should
give your dog a listen.</font>

572
00:42:31,503 --> 00:42:32,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ain't you Indian?</font>

573
00:42:32,755 --> 00:42:34,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're supposed to be
burning sage</font>

574
00:42:34,922 --> 00:42:39,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and dancing around the bed,
whooping like a bee stung you.</font>

575
00:42:39,552 --> 00:42:41,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm Catholic.</font>

576
00:42:43,641 --> 00:42:44,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

577
00:42:46,601 --> 00:42:50,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, I'd rather dance
around the fire with a spear.</font>

578
00:42:50,438 --> 00:42:53,278
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd rather have you stab me
with a spear than watch this.</font>

579
00:42:53,442 --> 00:42:55,442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This son of a bitch,
he wouldn't know God</font>

580
00:42:55,610 --> 00:42:58,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if he crawled up his pant leg
and bit him on the pecker.</font>

581
00:42:58,739 --> 00:43:00,068
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Change the damn channel.</font>

582
00:43:08,164 --> 00:43:10,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, this, this is
what God watches right here.</font>

583
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry, they're gonna have
soccer highlights on soon enough.</font>

584
00:43:18,007 --> 00:43:19,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's for your Mexican half.</font>

585
00:43:25,431 --> 00:43:27,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow, look at this boy run.</font>

586
00:43:28,351 --> 00:43:30,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Longhorns are gonna have
a good team this year.</font>

587
00:43:34,775 --> 00:43:37,894
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That soccer,
never could understand that.</font>

588
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:41,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anything a 5-year-old can do
ain't a sport.</font>

589
00:43:41,447 --> 00:43:44,867
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who invented it? Aztecs?</font>

590
00:43:45,034 --> 00:43:47,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kickin' around skulls
or something, right?</font>

591
00:43:48,831 --> 00:43:50,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sounds like a Comanche sport.</font>

592
00:43:52,458 --> 00:43:54,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, in 3 weeks,</font>

593
00:43:54,378 --> 00:43:57,628
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you can watch whatever
you want on TV all day.</font>

594
00:43:57,797 --> 00:44:00,217
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hell, you can do it right now
in your own room.</font>

595
00:44:00,384 --> 00:44:02,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, where's the fun in that?</font>

596
00:44:03,469 --> 00:44:05,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what, Alberto?</font>

597
00:44:06,597 --> 00:44:07,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

598
00:44:09,101 --> 00:44:10,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In a year's time,</font>

599
00:44:11,936 --> 00:44:14,396
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it's my teasing
that you're gonna miss.</font>

600
00:44:16,108 --> 00:44:17,398
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's what you'll laugh about</font>

601
00:44:17,568 --> 00:44:20,568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when you stand over my grave
and wish me well.</font>

602
00:44:20,737 --> 00:44:22,487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God, I hope that's tomorrow.</font>

603
00:44:23,532 --> 00:44:24,911
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, that was a good one.</font>

604
00:44:27,619 --> 00:44:30,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll get the hang of this yet.</font>

605
00:44:36,503 --> 00:44:37,882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Isn't it getting late for you?</font>

606
00:44:42,885 --> 00:44:43,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

607
00:44:48,806 --> 00:44:50,097
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, it is.</font>

608
00:45:07,159 --> 00:45:08,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, heavens above.</font>

609
00:45:08,452 --> 00:45:10,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Heavens above.</font>

610
00:45:10,788 --> 00:45:12,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at those titties.
Are you fucking kidding me?</font>

611
00:45:58,126 --> 00:45:59,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>What are you doing?</i></font>

612
00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:05,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sleeping on the porch,
practicing my future.</font>

613
00:46:11,472 --> 00:46:13,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a dangerous thing
we do for a living.</font>

614
00:46:15,143 --> 00:46:16,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're lucky...</font>

615
00:46:17,813 --> 00:46:19,862
<font face="Comic Sans MS">having seen it through
to the end.</font>

616
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:22,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hope I'm that lucky.</font>

617
00:46:24,862 --> 00:46:26,112
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, well.</font>

618
00:46:27,489 --> 00:46:30,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Without me by your side,
I doubt you'll get close enough</font>

619
00:46:30,284 --> 00:46:32,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to a criminal to ever be
in danger again.</font>

620
00:46:37,623 --> 00:46:39,884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just when I was starting
to feel sorry for you.</font>

621
00:46:41,961 --> 00:46:44,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indians ain't supposed
to feel sorry for cowboys.</font>

622
00:46:44,882 --> 00:46:46,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the other way around.</font>

623
00:46:55,099 --> 00:46:56,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And this makes you the executor?</font>

624
00:46:56,976 --> 00:46:58,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Mm-hmm.</i></font>

625
00:46:58,686 --> 00:47:01,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, no matter what they charge us with,
they can't take it away?</font>

626
00:47:01,606 --> 00:47:04,146
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's no way to trace funds
from a casino, all right?</font>

627
00:47:04,318 --> 00:47:07,697
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Once you get the checks to the bank,
trust is untouchable.</font>

628
00:47:07,862 --> 00:47:11,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't tell
nobody nothing, right?</font>

629
00:47:11,742 --> 00:47:12,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, what is there to tell?</font>

630
00:47:13,117 --> 00:47:15,998
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, you boys won
that money gambling, didn't you?</font>

631
00:47:18,623 --> 00:47:21,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">$32,000 pays off
the reverse mortgage.</font>

632
00:47:21,835 --> 00:47:25,295
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And those bastards paid
the property tax from 2012 to now.</font>

633
00:47:25,463 --> 00:47:27,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's another $11,000.</font>

634
00:47:27,673 --> 00:47:30,643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, $43,000
and you are free and clear.</font>

635
00:47:31,719 --> 00:47:35,429
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just have the loan officer
fax me a release of lien,</font>

636
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:38,139
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I'll get that over
to the lease manager at Chevron.</font>

637
00:47:38,309 --> 00:47:40,309
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- The fax number is on the card.
- Okay.</font>

638
00:47:40,478 --> 00:47:42,148
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How much you making
on this deal?</font>

639
00:47:43,273 --> 00:47:45,693
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not near as much as I'm risking.</font>

640
00:47:45,858 --> 00:47:46,989
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why you doin' it, then?</font>

641
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:55,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, they loaned
the least they could.</font>

642
00:47:55,369 --> 00:47:58,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just enough to keep your mama poor
on a guaranteed return.</font>

643
00:47:59,789 --> 00:48:03,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thought they could swipe
her land for $25,000.</font>

644
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:06,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's just so arrogant,
it makes my teeth hurt.</font>

645
00:48:10,050 --> 00:48:11,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To see you boys...</font>

646
00:48:12,344 --> 00:48:14,813
<font face="Comic Sans MS">pay those bastards back
with their own money?</font>

647
00:48:17,724 --> 00:48:19,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, if that ain't Texan,
I don't know what is.</font>

648
00:48:25,231 --> 00:48:26,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

649
00:48:26,565 --> 00:48:28,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, they can foreclose
on Friday.</font>

650
00:48:28,610 --> 00:48:29,699
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come hell or high water,</font>

651
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:31,411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">be at the bank in Childress
on Thursday.</font>

652
00:48:31,570 --> 00:48:32,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Knowing them fuckers,
they will close early.</font>

653
00:48:33,155 --> 00:48:35,735
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We'll be there.
- Oh, and, Toby.</font>

654
00:48:35,909 --> 00:48:38,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The trust needs to be managed
by a bank.</font>

655
00:48:38,202 --> 00:48:40,213
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You really wanna cover
your tracks?</font>

656
00:48:41,289 --> 00:48:43,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You get Texas Midland
to handle this trust.</font>

657
00:49:02,476 --> 00:49:06,056
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, what's the plan?</font>

658
00:49:06,231 --> 00:49:09,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're gonna watch that bank
like a deer feeder.</font>

659
00:49:09,650 --> 00:49:11,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In time, we'll be right.</font>

660
00:49:12,070 --> 00:49:14,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, let's see
what they got to eat here.</font>

661
00:49:15,865 --> 00:49:18,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Howdy, ma'am.
How you doing today?</font>

662
00:49:18,201 --> 00:49:20,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hot, and I don't mean
the good kind.</font>

663
00:49:21,954 --> 00:49:23,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, what don't you want?</font>

664
00:49:24,123 --> 00:49:25,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pardon?</font>

665
00:49:25,916 --> 00:49:27,496
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What don't you want?</font>

666
00:49:29,045 --> 00:49:32,465
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, well, uh,
I think I'll just, uh...</font>

667
00:49:32,632 --> 00:49:35,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, I've been working here
for 44 years.</font>

668
00:49:35,927 --> 00:49:38,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ain't nobody
ever ordered nothing</font>

669
00:49:38,179 --> 00:49:40,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but T-bone steak
and a baked potato.</font>

670
00:49:40,974 --> 00:49:43,483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Except this one asshole
from New York</font>

671
00:49:43,643 --> 00:49:46,733
<font face="Comic Sans MS">tried to order trout
back in 1987.</font>

672
00:49:46,896 --> 00:49:49,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We don't sell
no goddamned trout.</font>

673
00:49:50,317 --> 00:49:52,817
<font face="Comic Sans MS">T-bone steaks.</font>

674
00:49:52,985 --> 00:49:56,815
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, either you don't want
the corn on the cob,</font>

675
00:49:56,989 --> 00:49:59,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or you don't want
the green beans.</font>

676
00:49:59,534 --> 00:50:00,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, what don't you want?</font>

677
00:50:05,164 --> 00:50:06,664
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't want green beans.</font>

678
00:50:06,833 --> 00:50:08,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't want green beans either.</font>

679
00:50:08,793 --> 00:50:10,884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Steaks cooked medium rare.</font>

680
00:50:11,045 --> 00:50:14,335
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Can I get my steak cooked...
- That weren't no question.</font>

681
00:50:14,507 --> 00:50:15,547
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.</font>

682
00:50:16,550 --> 00:50:18,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Iced tea for you boys.</font>

683
00:50:18,762 --> 00:50:20,012
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Iced tea would be great.</font>

684
00:50:21,306 --> 00:50:23,266
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Iced tea, yep.
Thank you, ma'am.</font>

685
00:50:23,432 --> 00:50:24,643
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Uh-huh.</i></font>

686
00:50:28,313 --> 00:50:29,943
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I'll tell you one thing.</font>

687
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:33,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nobody's gonna rob
this son of a bitch.</font>

688
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:35,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My word.</font>

689
00:50:44,579 --> 00:50:45,708
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How's she feel?</font>

690
00:50:46,873 --> 00:50:48,543
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She runs good.</font>

691
00:50:48,708 --> 00:50:50,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ain't gonna win any races.</font>

692
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:52,501
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Got New Mexico plates.</font>

693
00:50:54,172 --> 00:50:55,422
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She got a top?</font>

694
00:50:55,590 --> 00:50:56,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How she came.</font>

695
00:50:58,635 --> 00:51:00,295
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll take her.</font>

696
00:51:02,889 --> 00:51:04,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't report it stolen till Friday.</font>

697
00:51:11,856 --> 00:51:13,777
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The guy from Chevron
is dropping off the lease agreement.</font>

698
00:51:13,942 --> 00:51:15,822
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you okay dealing with that
by yourself?</font>

699
00:51:15,985 --> 00:51:17,606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You okay being with Debbie
by yourself?</font>

700
00:51:18,737 --> 00:51:19,867
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Remember,
he ain't the enemy.</font>

701
00:51:20,030 --> 00:51:22,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just take the papers,
say thank you.</font>

702
00:51:23,784 --> 00:51:25,905
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The oil man is the enemy,
make no mistake.</font>

703
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:27,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He just ain't ours.</font>

704
00:51:29,583 --> 00:51:30,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll be back to the ranch by dark.</font>

705
00:51:31,001 --> 00:51:32,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will be waiting.</font>

706
00:51:32,168 --> 00:51:34,378
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drive like a schoolteacher
with all this shit in the back.</font>

707
00:51:38,215 --> 00:51:40,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure feels like beer o'clock.</font>

708
00:51:41,969 --> 00:51:44,929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ask and you shall receive.</font>

709
00:52:14,251 --> 00:52:15,302
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Come in.</i></font>

710
00:52:26,222 --> 00:52:27,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mama died.</font>

711
00:52:27,849 --> 00:52:29,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When?</font>

712
00:52:29,684 --> 00:52:30,853
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A few weeks ago.</font>

713
00:52:32,519 --> 00:52:33,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, good riddance.</font>

714
00:52:35,148 --> 00:52:36,268
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No offense.</font>

715
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:39,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You okay?</font>

716
00:52:41,612 --> 00:52:42,702
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You?</font>

717
00:52:46,659 --> 00:52:47,869
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here's the money I owe you.</font>

718
00:52:50,664 --> 00:52:53,253
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess you'll be selling
the ranch.</font>

719
00:52:54,251 --> 00:52:55,501
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It goes to the boys.</font>

720
00:52:55,668 --> 00:52:56,668
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Really?
- Mmm.</font>

721
00:52:56,835 --> 00:52:58,335
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's been put in a trust.</font>

722
00:52:58,505 --> 00:52:59,664
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's that mean?</font>

723
00:52:59,838 --> 00:53:01,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It means no one can sell it.</font>

724
00:53:02,675 --> 00:53:04,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Great.</font>

725
00:53:04,219 --> 00:53:06,298
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Something else
I got to take care of.</font>

726
00:53:19,275 --> 00:53:20,396
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi.</font>

727
00:53:58,023 --> 00:53:59,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's your brother?</font>

728
00:54:01,192 --> 00:54:02,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.</font>

729
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:04,701
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Friend's house, I guess.</font>

730
00:54:11,202 --> 00:54:12,541
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How come you ain't in school?</font>

731
00:54:13,621 --> 00:54:15,460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">School don't start yet.</font>

732
00:54:15,623 --> 00:54:18,342
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just 2-a-days
for football right now.</font>

733
00:54:24,548 --> 00:54:26,048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your grandmother died.</font>

734
00:54:28,677 --> 00:54:30,717
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm giving the ranch
to you and your brother.</font>

735
00:54:32,806 --> 00:54:34,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Remember going out there
when you was little?</font>

736
00:54:36,728 --> 00:54:38,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What am I supposed to do
with a ranch?</font>

737
00:54:40,065 --> 00:54:41,224
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anything but sell it.</font>

738
00:54:43,902 --> 00:54:45,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We found oil on it.</font>

739
00:54:47,864 --> 00:54:50,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You and your brother ain't gonna
have to worry about money no more.</font>

740
00:54:53,327 --> 00:54:54,327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now...</font>

741
00:54:55,996 --> 00:54:58,786
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you may be hearing
a lot of things about me and...</font>

742
00:54:59,918 --> 00:55:01,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">your uncle.</font>

743
00:55:04,047 --> 00:55:05,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't be like us.</font>

744
00:55:05,590 --> 00:55:06,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You hear me?</font>

745
00:55:08,259 --> 00:55:10,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whatever I hear,
I won't believe.</font>

746
00:55:10,762 --> 00:55:11,972
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, you believe it.</font>

747
00:55:13,472 --> 00:55:14,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I did all of it.</font>

748
00:55:17,268 --> 00:55:19,018
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, you, you do it different.</font>

749
00:55:29,864 --> 00:55:30,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ain't gonna drink it?</font>

750
00:55:34,369 --> 00:55:37,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You tell me not to be like you,
and then you offer me a beer.</font>

751
00:55:37,746 --> 00:55:38,827
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which is it?</font>

752
00:55:41,876 --> 00:55:42,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good boy.</font>

753
00:56:03,898 --> 00:56:06,228
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How are the boys?
- What are you doin'?</font>

754
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:07,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Insurance.</font>

755
00:56:08,527 --> 00:56:10,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't want that shit in the car.</font>

756
00:56:10,487 --> 00:56:13,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll be running two cars
next time, brother.</font>

757
00:56:13,490 --> 00:56:14,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They'll ride with me.</font>

758
00:56:21,039 --> 00:56:22,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, this is your plan?</font>

759
00:56:22,876 --> 00:56:24,286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're just gonna sit here</font>

760
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:26,751
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and see if this is the branch
they rob next.</font>

761
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:28,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What would you rather do?</font>

762
00:56:28,213 --> 00:56:29,884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You wanna drive 80 miles
back to Olney</font>

763
00:56:30,048 --> 00:56:32,759
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and look for more fingerprints
that we ain't gonna find?</font>

764
00:56:32,927 --> 00:56:35,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or you wanna drive 200 miles
back to Lubbock</font>

765
00:56:35,847 --> 00:56:37,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and look at mugshots that don't matter
'cause nobody knows</font>

766
00:56:38,141 --> 00:56:39,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what these sons of bitches
look like?</font>

767
00:56:39,851 --> 00:56:42,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or we can just wait here
for them to rob this bank,</font>

768
00:56:42,603 --> 00:56:45,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which is the one thing I'm pretty
damn sure they are going to do.</font>

769
00:56:45,481 --> 00:56:46,652
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know what you're doing.</font>

770
00:56:48,067 --> 00:56:50,067
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're trying to make this last
as long as you can</font>

771
00:56:50,235 --> 00:56:51,396
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because the longer it lasts,</font>

772
00:56:51,570 --> 00:56:53,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the farther you are
from that front porch.</font>

773
00:56:53,322 --> 00:56:55,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I'm waitin' for these boys
to make a mistake.</font>

774
00:56:55,992 --> 00:56:57,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So far they ain't, but they will.</font>

775
00:56:57,784 --> 00:56:59,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And they're gonna make it here.</font>

776
00:57:00,371 --> 00:57:01,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, just relax.</font>

777
00:57:03,166 --> 00:57:04,706
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Enjoy this little town.</font>

778
00:57:04,876 --> 00:57:06,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you wanna live here?</font>

779
00:57:06,293 --> 00:57:07,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Got an old hardware store</font>

780
00:57:07,711 --> 00:57:10,262
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that charges twice
what Home Depot does,</font>

781
00:57:10,422 --> 00:57:14,342
<font face="Comic Sans MS">one restaurant with
a rattlesnake for a waitress.</font>

782
00:57:14,510 --> 00:57:17,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, how is anybody
supposed to make a living here?</font>

783
00:57:17,514 --> 00:57:20,184
<font face="Comic Sans MS">People have made a living here
for 150 years.</font>

784
00:57:20,349 --> 00:57:23,019
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, people lived in caves
for 150,000 years,</font>

785
00:57:23,186 --> 00:57:24,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but they don't do it no more.</font>

786
00:57:24,603 --> 00:57:27,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, maybe your people did.</font>

787
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:29,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your people did, too.</font>

788
00:57:30,610 --> 00:57:33,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A long time ago,
your ancestors was the Indians...</font>

789
00:57:35,072 --> 00:57:37,452
<font face="Comic Sans MS">till someone came along
and killed them,</font>

790
00:57:37,617 --> 00:57:40,697
<font face="Comic Sans MS">broke 'em down,
made you into one of them.</font>

791
00:57:42,204 --> 00:57:47,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">150 years ago, all this
was my ancestors' land.</font>

792
00:57:48,628 --> 00:57:50,257
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everything you can see.</font>

793
00:57:51,505 --> 00:57:53,335
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everything you saw yesterday.</font>

794
00:57:54,550 --> 00:57:57,101
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Till the grandparents
of these folks took it.</font>

795
00:57:59,472 --> 00:58:01,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And now, it's been taken
from them.</font>

796
00:58:02,599 --> 00:58:04,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Except it ain't no army doing it.</font>

797
00:58:05,936 --> 00:58:08,056
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's those sons of bitches
right there.</font>

798
00:58:18,324 --> 00:58:19,623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You thinking about tomorrow?</font>

799
00:58:22,077 --> 00:58:23,248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ain't you?</font>

800
00:58:24,496 --> 00:58:25,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The little hotel clerk.</font>

801
00:58:27,958 --> 00:58:29,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why is it always the sweet ones</font>

802
00:58:29,710 --> 00:58:32,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that are such devils
when you get them revved up?</font>

803
00:58:33,797 --> 00:58:36,088
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wouldn't know.
Never had a sweet one.</font>

804
00:58:37,427 --> 00:58:40,927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, you like them pissed off,
lookin' for someone to blame.</font>

805
00:58:42,724 --> 00:58:44,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure seems that way.</font>

806
00:58:56,737 --> 00:58:58,108
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a good thing you're doing.</font>

807
00:59:01,326 --> 00:59:02,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're doing it.</font>

808
00:59:17,759 --> 00:59:19,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go easy on the bank teller
tomorrow.</font>

809
00:59:21,094 --> 00:59:23,505
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll be as gentle
as a young nurse.</font>

810
01:00:27,994 --> 01:00:29,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You coming?</font>

811
01:00:30,164 --> 01:00:31,373
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On my way-</font>

812
01:01:15,626 --> 01:01:16,666
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

813
01:01:17,753 --> 01:01:18,804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit.</font>

814
01:01:23,009 --> 01:01:24,088
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Morning.</font>

815
01:01:26,596 --> 01:01:27,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want some breakfast?</font>

816
01:01:27,804 --> 01:01:29,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, breakfast sounds good.</font>

817
01:01:34,228 --> 01:01:37,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So we hit the Jayton branch first,
then Coleman, right?</font>

818
01:01:37,481 --> 01:01:39,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, that should get us
what we need.</font>

819
01:02:34,789 --> 01:02:36,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's do this.</font>

820
01:02:39,501 --> 01:02:42,052
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ugh... shit.</font>

821
01:02:43,047 --> 01:02:44,257
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not part of the fucking plan.</font>

822
01:02:44,422 --> 01:02:45,932
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The bastards closed down
the branch.</font>

823
01:02:48,344 --> 01:02:49,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What now, little brother?</font>

824
01:02:51,639 --> 01:02:52,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Coleman.</font>

825
01:03:27,757 --> 01:03:29,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What the hell you doing?
- We gotta head to Post.</font>

826
01:03:29,927 --> 01:03:31,257
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What the hell are you doing?
- Get...</font>

827
01:03:37,934 --> 01:03:40,184
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We got to head to Post.
- What are you talking about?</font>

828
01:03:40,353 --> 01:03:42,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We got to head to Post.</font>

829
01:03:42,315 --> 01:03:43,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're going to Coleman.</font>

830
01:03:43,565 --> 01:03:44,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's only one teller in Coleman.</font>

831
01:03:45,067 --> 01:03:46,487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whatever we get won't be enough.</font>

832
01:03:48,070 --> 01:03:49,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We go to Coleman right now.</font>

833
01:03:49,322 --> 01:03:50,452
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If that ain't enough,
we head to Post.</font>

834
01:03:50,614 --> 01:03:53,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If we don't leave now for Post,
we won't get there till noon.</font>

835
01:03:53,284 --> 01:03:54,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't wanna rob a bank
at lunchtime, do you?</font>

836
01:03:56,161 --> 01:03:57,661
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, we don't know the patterns
of folks out there.</font>

837
01:03:57,829 --> 01:03:59,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The patterns
are the same everywhere.</font>

838
01:03:59,539 --> 01:04:01,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All these towns are dead.
Post ain't no different.</font>

839
01:04:02,876 --> 01:04:03,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a bigger bank.</font>

840
01:04:05,086 --> 01:04:07,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>We'll leave your car
just out of town.</i></font>

841
01:04:07,213 --> 01:04:08,304
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Come on, now.</i></font>

842
01:04:09,342 --> 01:04:11,012
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit.</font>

843
01:04:18,643 --> 01:04:20,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I got this figured.</font>

844
01:04:21,311 --> 01:04:25,692
<font face="Comic Sans MS">First two banks,
they were Texas Midland Banks.</font>

845
01:04:26,692 --> 01:04:28,742
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, there are
7 branches altogether.</font>

846
01:04:28,902 --> 01:04:31,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The main branch is in Fort Worth.</font>

847
01:04:31,197 --> 01:04:32,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're not gonna mess with that.</font>

848
01:04:33,990 --> 01:04:37,411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, they hit
the branch in Olney.</font>

849
01:04:37,577 --> 01:04:40,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They hit the one in Archer City.</font>

850
01:04:40,373 --> 01:04:43,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Then there's the one here.
- Which they did not hit.</font>

851
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:49,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alberto, will you please
follow me?</font>

852
01:04:50,632 --> 01:04:52,552
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't let... just keep
your mouth shut</font>

853
01:04:52,717 --> 01:04:54,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and just listen
to what I'm gonna say.</font>

854
01:04:54,762 --> 01:04:56,181
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's the one here...</font>

855
01:04:57,431 --> 01:04:59,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then there's the one
in Childress.</font>

856
01:04:59,474 --> 01:05:00,804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's the one in Jayton.</font>

857
01:05:00,976 --> 01:05:02,306
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That one's closed.</font>

858
01:05:02,478 --> 01:05:04,228
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know that one's closed!</font>

859
01:05:07,023 --> 01:05:09,614
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know that one's closed,
Alberto.</font>

860
01:05:12,487 --> 01:05:13,987
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's my point.</font>

861
01:05:14,155 --> 01:05:16,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jayton is closed.</font>

862
01:05:16,742 --> 01:05:18,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That just leaves Post.</font>

863
01:05:18,411 --> 01:05:19,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're not gonna mess
with the bank in Childress.</font>

864
01:05:20,121 --> 01:05:23,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a fairly
decent-sized town.</font>

865
01:05:23,498 --> 01:05:26,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The branch in Vernon
wasn't Midlands and they hit that.</font>

866
01:05:26,376 --> 01:05:28,746
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, one of them did.
Alone.</font>

867
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:31,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then he ran all the way
across the road to get to the car.</font>

868
01:05:32,007 --> 01:05:34,217
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think his partner had no idea
that was gonna happen.</font>

869
01:05:34,385 --> 01:05:35,465
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What does that mean to us?</font>

870
01:05:35,635 --> 01:05:39,215
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It means that the only branch
that fits the bill is in Post.</font>

871
01:05:39,389 --> 01:05:40,429
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, then let's go.</font>

872
01:06:08,918 --> 01:06:10,168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The town looks busy.</font>

873
01:06:11,838 --> 01:06:12,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Little bit.</font>

874
01:06:21,514 --> 01:06:23,014
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My word.</font>

875
01:06:33,485 --> 01:06:34,815
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's too big.</font>

876
01:06:34,987 --> 01:06:36,277
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what she said.</font>

877
01:06:39,574 --> 01:06:41,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's no good.</font>

878
01:06:41,659 --> 01:06:43,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aw, this ain't your first rodeo.</font>

879
01:06:46,039 --> 01:06:47,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bigger bank...</font>

880
01:06:49,376 --> 01:06:50,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">more money.</font>

881
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:12,190
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everybody,
get on the fucking ground!</font>

882
01:07:12,358 --> 01:07:13,938
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get on the fucking ground!</font>

883
01:07:14,110 --> 01:07:17,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Young ladies, get on
the fucking ground! Now!</font>

884
01:07:17,530 --> 01:07:21,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, down!
On the ground! Now!</font>

885
01:07:21,992 --> 01:07:23,541
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you very much.</font>

886
01:07:27,289 --> 01:07:28,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tellers, stand up!</font>

887
01:07:30,793 --> 01:07:32,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Open the drawers!</font>

888
01:07:35,922 --> 01:07:37,882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get down!</font>

889
01:07:38,050 --> 01:07:40,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take 3 steps back!</font>

890
01:07:40,260 --> 01:07:42,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Open the fucking drawer,
young lady!</font>

891
01:07:42,804 --> 01:07:44,215
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you deaf and dumb?</font>

892
01:07:44,389 --> 01:07:46,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I said open
the motherfucking drawer!</font>

893
01:07:46,766 --> 01:07:48,387
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You, down!
- All right. Oh, please.</font>

894
01:07:48,561 --> 01:07:50,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Now step back!</i></font>

895
01:07:51,646 --> 01:07:52,646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Very good.</font>

896
01:07:52,815 --> 01:07:54,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Someone's paying attention.</font>

897
01:07:56,527 --> 01:08:00,606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now get on
your motherfucking knees!</font>

898
01:08:00,780 --> 01:08:01,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

899
01:08:02,867 --> 01:08:04,327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay down!</font>

900
01:08:12,793 --> 01:08:14,043
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.</font>

901
01:08:35,149 --> 01:08:36,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dude.</font>

902
01:08:48,328 --> 01:08:49,498
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, hey, let's go!</font>

903
01:08:49,662 --> 01:08:51,002
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Call 911!</i></font>

904
01:08:52,541 --> 01:08:54,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jesus fucking Christ.</font>

905
01:08:55,627 --> 01:08:57,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The whole goddamn town
is shooting at us.</font>

906
01:08:58,838 --> 01:09:01,088
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get in the back.
Get in the fucking back.</font>

907
01:09:14,145 --> 01:09:16,145
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, let's go!
Get in the car!</font>

908
01:09:16,314 --> 01:09:17,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't let them get away!</font>

909
01:09:20,818 --> 01:09:22,898
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How you doing back there,
little brother?</font>

910
01:09:23,069 --> 01:09:24,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You fucking killed them.</font>

911
01:09:24,572 --> 01:09:25,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These concealed carry permits</font>

912
01:09:26,032 --> 01:09:28,332
<font face="Comic Sans MS">sure complicate
a bank robbery, don't they?</font>

913
01:09:28,492 --> 01:09:30,122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not my fault it was payday.</font>

914
01:09:35,038 --> 01:09:36,418
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This has gone too far, Tan.</font>

915
01:09:36,582 --> 01:09:38,462
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No one was supposed
to fucking die.</font>

916
01:09:38,626 --> 01:09:41,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was them or us.
Take your pick.</font>

917
01:09:55,807 --> 01:09:57,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, go, Margaret.</font>

918
01:09:57,601 --> 01:09:59,811
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Texas Midlands in Post
has just been hit.</font>

919
01:09:59,979 --> 01:10:02,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah! What did I tell you?</font>

920
01:10:02,439 --> 01:10:03,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

921
01:10:03,649 --> 01:10:05,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah!
- Locals are in chase.</font>

922
01:10:05,775 --> 01:10:07,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Suspects escaping west</font>

923
01:10:07,569 --> 01:10:09,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in an old Bronco.</font>

924
01:10:09,404 --> 01:10:11,864
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, Margaret, keep us posted.
We're on our way there.</font>

925
01:10:12,033 --> 01:10:13,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me an Indian whoop.
Come on.</font>

926
01:10:16,494 --> 01:10:18,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These boys are gonna go down.</font>

927
01:10:18,204 --> 01:10:20,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's get some giddy-up music
going on there.</font>

928
01:10:25,212 --> 01:10:26,261
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, please, not that.</font>

929
01:10:45,974 --> 01:10:47,064

01:10:55,774 --> 01:10:58,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Snap the fuck out of it.</font>

932
01:10:58,444 --> 01:11:00,604
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit, let me see that.
You're hit.</font>

933
01:11:00,779 --> 01:11:02,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Boy, you're hit.

01:11:04,617 --> 01:11:07,327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, you'll live.
It's a through and through.</font>

935
01:11:07,494 --> 01:11:11,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Compress it. Wrap it up.
You got to wrap it up tight.</font>

936
01:11:11,332 --> 01:11:12,712
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Front and back,
front and back.</font>

937
01:11:15,372 --> 01:11:16,421
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wrap it tight.</font>

938
01:11:22,796 --> 01:11:25,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, brother, hear me now,
hear me clear.</font>

939
01:11:26,007 --> 01:11:28,587
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Unless you wanna be a black mark
on your sons' lives,</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need you mountain lion mean.</font>

941
01:11:31,012 --> 01:11:32,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You hear me?</font>

01:11:32,890 --> 01:11:33,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hear you.</font>

943
01:11:34,140 --> 01:11:35,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Mountain lion mean.
- Yeah.</font>

944
01:11:35,559 --> 01:11:39,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.</font>

945
01:11:39,563 --> 01:11:40,733
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hold on.
- Yeah.</font>

946
01:12:37,746 --> 01:12:38,746
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go.</font>

947
01:12:50,175 --> 01:12:51,295
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here, take the money.</font>

948
01:12:55,805 --> 01:12:57,265
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Let's go.
- Get to the casino.</font>

949
01:12:57,431 --> 01:12:58,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Change the money
like we planned.</font>

950
01:12:58,850 --> 01:13:02,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This was your plan,
and it worked.</font>

951
01:13:02,311 --> 01:13:03,652
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Every step of the way.</font>

952
01:13:04,814 --> 01:13:06,015
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Trust it.</font>

953
01:13:11,529 --> 01:13:12,779
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where are you headed?</font>

954
01:13:18,871 --> 01:13:19,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't be stupid.</font>

955
01:13:23,583 --> 01:13:24,884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love you, Toby.</font>

956
01:13:28,630 --> 01:13:29,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean it.</font>

957
01:13:36,971 --> 01:13:38,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love you, too.</font>

958
01:13:44,145 --> 01:13:46,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Tobe, go fuck yourself.</font>

959
01:13:46,648 --> 01:13:47,818
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go fuck yourself.</font>

960
01:14:04,541 --> 01:14:08,091
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As I walked out
one sunny morning</font>

961
01:14:08,252 --> 01:14:11,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I spied a young cowboy
a loping along</font>

962
01:14:11,756 --> 01:14:13,627
<font face="Comic Sans MS">His hat was laid back</font>

963
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:15,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">His spurs were a jinglin'</font>

964
01:14:15,927 --> 01:14:19,307
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And as he come near me
He's singing this song</font>

965
01:14:24,394 --> 01:14:26,904
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yippee hiyiyo.
You little doggies.</font>

966
01:14:27,064 --> 01:14:30,613
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's your misfortune
and none of my own</font>

967
01:14:59,512 --> 01:15:02,103
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is what they call
white man's intuition.</font>

968
01:15:03,307 --> 01:15:05,478
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes a blind pig
finds a truffle.</font>

969
01:15:12,609 --> 01:15:17,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's your misfortune
and none of my own</font>

970
01:16:00,907 --> 01:16:03,617
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Back up! Oh, shit!</font>

971
01:16:03,784 --> 01:16:05,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go! Move!</font>

972
01:16:16,422 --> 01:16:17,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My word.</font>

973
01:16:17,923 --> 01:16:19,974
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, We're gonna need
a SWAT unit up here</font>

974
01:16:20,135 --> 01:16:22,005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and a helo to pin
these boys down.</font>

975
01:16:33,105 --> 01:16:34,935
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Suspect is a white male.</i></font>

976
01:16:36,318 --> 01:16:37,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Guys, spread it out!</i></font>

977
01:16:39,070 --> 01:16:40,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's got a rifle.
Get down!</font>

978
01:16:40,447 --> 01:16:42,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>He's on the ridge!
He's on the ridge!</i></font>

979
01:16:44,701 --> 01:16:46,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, I see him!</font>

980
01:16:48,954 --> 01:16:49,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's just one?</font>

981
01:16:50,122 --> 01:16:51,292
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yep, just one.</font>

982
01:16:51,457 --> 01:16:52,707
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's supposed
to be two of them.</font>

983
01:16:52,876 --> 01:16:54,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe the town folks got one.</font>

984
01:16:56,462 --> 01:16:58,552
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, if they did,
they got the smart one.</font>

985
01:16:58,715 --> 01:17:00,715
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This old boy
is out of his mind.</font>

986
01:17:00,884 --> 01:17:04,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't you slip up this canyon
and tomahawk that son of a bitch?</font>

987
01:17:23,489 --> 01:17:25,489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ranger down.
Call it in.</font>

988
01:17:25,658 --> 01:17:29,578
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get back! Back!
Back those trucks up!</font>

989
01:17:31,247 --> 01:17:32,368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get back!</font>

990
01:17:33,625 --> 01:17:35,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get these trucks back.</font>

991
01:17:35,252 --> 01:17:36,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Back up!</font>

992
01:17:39,296 --> 01:17:40,377
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Back them up.</font>

993
01:17:40,548 --> 01:17:42,009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How well do you know the land
around here?</font>

994
01:17:42,175 --> 01:17:44,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like the back of my hand.</font>

995
01:17:44,261 --> 01:17:46,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, he's hid up
in that brush on that hill.</font>

996
01:17:46,846 --> 01:17:48,346
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you get me up there
behind him?</font>

997
01:17:48,515 --> 01:17:50,015
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me a half hour,
I'll have that bastard</font>

998
01:17:50,182 --> 01:17:52,443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">field dressed on the hood
of my truck.</font>

999
01:17:52,601 --> 01:17:54,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't let you do that.
You just get me there.</font>

1000
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:56,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's gonna be a 500-yard shot
if he's where you said.</font>

1001
01:17:56,730 --> 01:17:57,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just get me there!</font>

1002
01:18:12,538 --> 01:18:13,708
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit.</font>

1003
01:18:58,083 --> 01:18:59,213
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How are you doing?</font>

1004
01:18:59,377 --> 01:19:01,587
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good. You?</font>

1005
01:19:01,755 --> 01:19:03,005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where are you headed?</font>

1006
01:19:03,172 --> 01:19:04,262
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ruidoso.</font>

1007
01:19:06,426 --> 01:19:07,466
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where you from?</font>

1008
01:19:07,636 --> 01:19:08,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hamlin.</font>

1009
01:19:11,389 --> 01:19:12,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Taking the scenic route?</font>

1010
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:16,189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Taking the only way I can.</font>

1011
01:19:16,353 --> 01:19:17,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They got the road closed
at Post.</font>

1012
01:19:17,729 --> 01:19:19,649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everywhere you turn
they got the road closed.</font>

1013
01:19:21,233 --> 01:19:23,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You got your license on you?
- Yes, I do.</font>

1014
01:19:28,239 --> 01:19:29,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait right there.</font>

1015
01:19:29,490 --> 01:19:30,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, sir.</font>

1016
01:20:08,613 --> 01:20:10,243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sir.
- Yeah.</font>

1017
01:20:11,490 --> 01:20:13,451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have a good day.</font>

1018
01:20:13,618 --> 01:20:14,698
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks much.</font>

1019
01:21:17,306 --> 01:21:19,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're pretty winded.</font>

1020
01:21:19,266 --> 01:21:21,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You oughta let me take the shot.
Hell, it's my gun.</font>

1021
01:21:22,061 --> 01:21:24,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not on your life.</font>

1022
01:21:24,355 --> 01:21:25,895
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's mine.</font>

1023
01:21:55,595 --> 01:21:56,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Just left of the tree.</i></font>

1024
01:21:56,930 --> 01:21:58,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got him.</font>

1025
01:22:14,405 --> 01:22:15,865
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got you.</font>

1026
01:22:24,623 --> 01:22:26,003
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lord of the Plains.</font>

1027
01:22:29,128 --> 01:22:30,338
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's me.</font>

1028
01:23:42,911 --> 01:23:45,501
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>...definitely something
out of a dime-store novel.</i></font>

1029
01:23:45,662 --> 01:23:48,502
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Texas Highway Patrol
and the locals</i></font>

1030
01:23:48,666 --> 01:23:52,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>chased the robbers

1031
01:23:52,377 --> 01:23:56,417
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>20 miles west of town,
where the gunfight continued.</i></font>

1032
01:23:56,591 --> 01:23:58,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And right now we do know</i></font>

1033
01:23:58,176 --> 01:24:02,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Ranger Marcus Hamilton
killed one of the gunmen</i></font>

1034
01:24:02,305 --> 01:24:05,845
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>using a rifle he actually borrowed
from a resident here.</i></font>

1035
01:24:06,016 --> 01:24:09,056
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>We don't know the name
of that suspect yet...</i></font>

1036
01:25:06,327 --> 01:25:07,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lucky guy-</font>

1037
01:25:09,956 --> 01:25:12,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just in the nick of time, too.</font>

1038
01:25:12,375 --> 01:25:13,534
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are the odds?</font>

1039
01:25:16,837 --> 01:25:20,627
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, this, uh, satisfies</font>

1040
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:23,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">both the reverse mortgage loan
and the, uh...</font>

1041
01:25:24,052 --> 01:25:26,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the back taxes that we've paid
on your mother's behalf.</font>

1042
01:25:26,847 --> 01:25:29,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We do that as courtesy,
of course.</font>

1043
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:36,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can fax the release of lien
to that number.</font>

1044
01:25:40,028 --> 01:25:41,148
<font face="Comic Sans MS">An attorney?</font>

1045
01:25:43,780 --> 01:25:46,451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, well, I'll... I'll get that
faxed over to your attorney</font>

1046
01:25:46,618 --> 01:25:47,698
<font face="Comic Sans MS">by the end of the week.</font>

1047
01:25:47,868 --> 01:25:50,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is the end of the week.
I wanna watch you do it.</font>

1048
01:25:55,001 --> 01:25:58,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, it takes a little time
to prepare.</font>

1049
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:00,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got all day.</font>

1050
01:26:08,972 --> 01:26:11,143
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here we go.</font>

1051
01:26:11,309 --> 01:26:14,229
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. That's it.</font>

1052
01:26:14,395 --> 01:26:18,185
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And it's been a pleasure
doing business with you.</font>

1053
01:26:32,997 --> 01:26:34,327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me ask you a question.</font>

1054
01:26:36,125 --> 01:26:37,534
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do y'all manage trusts?</font>

1055
01:26:43,048 --> 01:26:44,929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Marcus,
ain't you supposed to be retired?</font>

1056
01:26:45,092 --> 01:26:46,143
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Howdy.</font>

1057
01:26:51,306 --> 01:26:53,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Shelley.
- Nice to see you.</font>

1058
01:26:53,725 --> 01:26:55,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Well, hey, Marcus.
- Hey, Margaret.</font>

1059
01:26:55,770 --> 01:26:57,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Been awhile.
How's life as a civilian?</font>

1060
01:26:57,479 --> 01:27:00,979
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, just, you know...</font>

1061
01:27:01,149 --> 01:27:04,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Think I can take a peek
at Mr. Howard's file?</font>

1062
01:27:04,278 --> 01:27:05,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tanner Howard.</font>

1063
01:27:06,948 --> 01:27:09,908
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, come on.
I ain't got nothing better to do.</font>

1064
01:27:10,076 --> 01:27:11,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's at my desk.</font>

1065
01:27:12,328 --> 01:27:13,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh...</font>

1066
01:27:18,667 --> 01:27:21,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Killed his father
in a hunting accident, huh?</font>

1067
01:27:21,212 --> 01:27:24,131
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I'd love to know what he was hunting
in the barn in April.</i></font>

1068
01:27:24,297 --> 01:27:27,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">10 years in Huntsville
for aggravated assault.</font>

1069
01:27:27,926 --> 01:27:29,506
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cellmate was released in 2012.</font>

1070
01:27:29,679 --> 01:27:31,059
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Before that,
he served 7 years</font>

1071
01:27:31,221 --> 01:27:33,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">on bank robbery charges
up in Big Spring.</font>

1072
01:27:33,474 --> 01:27:35,734
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Been trying to track him down,
but no luck so far.</font>

1073
01:27:35,893 --> 01:27:37,603
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You all are off the brother?</font>

1074
01:27:37,770 --> 01:27:39,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's nothing that links him
to the robberies.</font>

1075
01:27:40,856 --> 01:27:43,067
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, what about
that little waitress in Vernon?</font>

1076
01:27:43,234 --> 01:27:44,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, we showed her photos.</font>

1077
01:27:44,484 --> 01:27:46,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She said she didn't
recognize him.</font>

1078
01:27:46,362 --> 01:27:48,662
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pretty upset you took
her tips as evidence.</font>

1079
01:27:50,240 --> 01:27:51,831
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She sure was sassy.</font>

1080
01:27:51,993 --> 01:27:53,752
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You show that
to that old timer?</font>

1081
01:27:53,911 --> 01:27:56,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Yep. He said he didn't look
like the fella from the diner.</i></font>

1082
01:27:56,788 --> 01:27:59,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He didn't recognize
Tanner's photo either.</font>

1083
01:27:59,250 --> 01:28:02,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, tried to get a court order
on his bank accounts and the ranch,</font>

1084
01:28:02,377 --> 01:28:03,417
<font face="Comic Sans MS">DA wouldn't do it.</font>

1085
01:28:03,587 --> 01:28:06,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Toby's got no record.
He's never been arrested.</font>

1086
01:28:06,256 --> 01:28:08,377
<font face="Comic Sans MS">His only court appearance
was at his divorce.</font>

1087
01:28:08,551 --> 01:28:10,551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He don't fit the bill, Marcus.</font>

1088
01:28:10,720 --> 01:28:12,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">People don't start out
robbing banks.</font>

1089
01:28:12,305 --> 01:28:14,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They graduate to it
like his asshole brother.</font>

1090
01:28:14,765 --> 01:28:16,225
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Besides,
when we was out there,</font>

1091
01:28:16,391 --> 01:28:17,981
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we saw two crews from Chevron</font>

1092
01:28:18,144 --> 01:28:20,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">capping wells
and putting in pumpjacks.</font>

1093
01:28:20,563 --> 01:28:22,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Engineers out there
said they're gonna pull</font>

1094
01:28:22,273 --> 01:28:24,483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">2,000 barrels a month
off that place.</font>

1095
01:28:24,649 --> 01:28:27,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You just try convincing a judge
to issue warrants on somebody</font>

1096
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:29,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">set to clear $50,000 a month</font>

1097
01:28:29,197 --> 01:28:32,277
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for robbing $40,000 from the bank
that manages the family trust.</font>

1098
01:28:32,449 --> 01:28:34,489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Midland manages the trust?</font>

1099
01:28:37,829 --> 01:28:40,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'd think they'd want
this thing figured out.</font>

1100
01:28:40,166 --> 01:28:42,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think the bank cares
about anything</font>

1101
01:28:42,210 --> 01:28:43,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but keeping that trust
right where it is.</font>

1102
01:28:44,962 --> 01:28:47,381
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hell, they were less cooperative
than Toby's attorney.</font>

1103
01:28:49,759 --> 01:28:53,009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marcus, he's not a suspect
and you are retired.</font>

1104
01:28:54,055 --> 01:28:55,215
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I hear you.</font>

1105
01:28:59,310 --> 01:29:00,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You like my desk?</font>

1106
01:29:02,063 --> 01:29:03,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't hate it.</font>

1107
01:29:06,067 --> 01:29:07,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, I'll see you, Marcus.</font>

1108
01:30:44,206 --> 01:30:45,666
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Know who I am?</font>

1109
01:30:50,003 --> 01:30:52,304
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm the man
who killed your brother.</font>

1110
01:30:52,465 --> 01:30:53,585
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know.</font>

1111
01:30:55,384 --> 01:30:57,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I also know you're retired
and you're trespassing.</font>

1112
01:30:59,012 --> 01:31:02,733
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, you could shoot me now
and be within your rights.</font>

1113
01:31:02,891 --> 01:31:05,902
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You toting a gun and all,
how convenient.</font>

1114
01:31:07,063 --> 01:31:08,653
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I figure you got one, too.</font>

1115
01:31:14,694 --> 01:31:15,984
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mind if I sit?</font>

1116
01:31:20,618 --> 01:31:21,658
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go ahead.</font>

1117
01:31:45,225 --> 01:31:46,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want a beer?</font>

1118
01:31:47,645 --> 01:31:50,645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure.
I ain't on duty no more.</font>

1119
01:32:01,283 --> 01:32:02,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks.</font>

1120
01:32:07,529 --> 01:32:10,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's nice out here
in this breeze, huh,</font>

1121
01:32:10,282 --> 01:32:11,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">now that it's cooled down.</font>

1122
01:32:22,622 --> 01:32:23,752
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How did you do it?</font>

1123
01:32:26,083 --> 01:32:27,344
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, never mind.</font>

1124
01:32:27,502 --> 01:32:29,421
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll figure that out in time.</font>

1125
01:32:29,587 --> 01:32:31,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why?
Why did you do it?</font>

1126
01:32:33,507 --> 01:32:35,927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know why your brother,
Tanner, did it.</font>

1127
01:32:36,094 --> 01:32:38,934
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He robbed them banks
because he liked it.</font>

1128
01:32:41,387 --> 01:32:44,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He shot my partner 300 yards away
'cause he liked it.</font>

1129
01:32:44,807 --> 01:32:45,978
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It made him feel good.</font>

1130
01:32:48,645 --> 01:32:50,685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I hadn't blown
his shit for brains out,</font>

1131
01:32:50,855 --> 01:32:54,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">there'd be a new truck out front
with jet skis</font>

1132
01:32:54,484 --> 01:32:56,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or whatever else
he could think to buy.</font>

1133
01:32:56,528 --> 01:33:00,738
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He'd spend it all just to give
an excuse to steal some more.</font>

1134
01:33:00,908 --> 01:33:02,278
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But not you.</font>

1135
01:33:04,862 --> 01:33:06,862
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's nothing new
around here...</font>

1136
01:33:08,114 --> 01:33:10,984
<font face="Comic Sans MS">except them pumpjacks.</font>

1137
01:33:11,159 --> 01:33:12,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Each one of them
making you a month</font>

1138
01:33:12,911 --> 01:33:16,171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what you and your brother stole
from all 4 banks combined.</font>

1139
01:33:17,623 --> 01:33:19,213
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help me understand, then.</font>

1140
01:33:22,003 --> 01:33:24,264
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help me understand
why 4 people died...</font>

1141
01:33:26,042 --> 01:33:29,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so you could steal money
that it don't seem you've spent,</font>

1142
01:33:30,005 --> 01:33:32,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that it don't seem you need.</font>

1143
01:33:32,256 --> 01:33:33,337
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got a family?</font>

1144
01:33:33,507 --> 01:33:35,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My partner had a family.
A big one.</font>

1145
01:33:36,802 --> 01:33:38,813
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They don't got no pumpjacks
in their backyard.</font>

1146
01:33:38,971 --> 01:33:41,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I didn't kill your friend.
- Yes, you did.</font>

1147
01:33:42,809 --> 01:33:44,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">By setting this thing
in motion.</font>

1148
01:33:46,061 --> 01:33:49,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You expect me to believe
your dimwitted brother planned this?</font>

1149
01:33:50,442 --> 01:33:53,492
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no.
This was smart.</font>

1150
01:33:53,653 --> 01:33:54,863
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This was you.</font>

1151
01:33:58,742 --> 01:34:00,542
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've been poor my whole life.</font>

1152
01:34:04,206 --> 01:34:06,626
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So were my parents,
their parents before them.</font>

1153
01:34:09,002 --> 01:34:10,502
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's like a disease...</font>

1154
01:34:12,213 --> 01:34:15,184
<font face="Comic Sans MS">passing from generation to generation,
becomes a sickness.</font>

1155
01:34:15,341 --> 01:34:16,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what it is.</font>

1156
01:34:18,261 --> 01:34:19,930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Infects every person you know...</font>

1157
01:34:21,139 --> 01:34:22,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but not my boys.</font>

1158
01:34:24,309 --> 01:34:25,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not anymore.</font>

1159
01:34:29,355 --> 01:34:30,645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is theirs now.</font>

1160
01:34:35,153 --> 01:34:36,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, I ain't never killed
no one in my life,</font>

1161
01:34:37,154 --> 01:34:40,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but if you want me to start with you,
let's get on with it, old man.</font>

1162
01:34:41,952 --> 01:34:45,002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See if you can grab that pistol
before I blast you off this porch.</font>

1163
01:35:24,536 --> 01:35:26,286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Howdy.
- What's going on?</font>

1164
01:35:27,956 --> 01:35:30,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The hogs are back
in the garden.</font>

1165
01:35:30,582 --> 01:35:33,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Feral hogs tearing up this place
something fierce.</font>

1166
01:35:34,796 --> 01:35:35,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who's this?</font>

1167
01:35:36,006 --> 01:35:37,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm an old friend
of your husband.</font>

1168
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:40,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ex-husband.</font>

1169
01:35:41,970 --> 01:35:43,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just working on the house.</font>

1170
01:35:44,430 --> 01:35:46,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, you don't live here?</font>

1171
01:35:46,307 --> 01:35:49,097
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, it's not mine.
It's theirs.</font>

1172
01:35:51,688 --> 01:35:53,268
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh.</font>

1173
01:35:53,439 --> 01:35:55,859
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The things we do
for our kids, huh?</font>

1174
01:35:58,444 --> 01:35:59,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well...</font>

1175
01:36:01,530 --> 01:36:02,701
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I best be going.</font>

1176
01:36:02,865 --> 01:36:03,985
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ma'am.</font>

1177
01:36:04,158 --> 01:36:05,948
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me, too, Debbie.
I'm gonna wash up,</font>

1178
01:36:06,118 --> 01:36:08,748
<font face="Comic Sans MS">be back around 9:00 tomorrow
to finish the front.</font>

1179
01:36:08,912 --> 01:36:10,002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Start painting the extension</font>

1180
01:36:10,164 --> 01:36:11,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and then help Randy
with his homework</font>

1181
01:36:11,498 --> 01:36:14,378
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when he gets back
from school, okay?</font>

1182
01:36:14,543 --> 01:36:15,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay-</font>

1183
01:36:18,840 --> 01:36:20,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

1184
01:36:21,384 --> 01:36:23,304
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I rent a little house in town.</font>

1185
01:36:25,180 --> 01:36:26,930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you wanna stop by
and finish this conversation,</font>

1186
01:36:27,097 --> 01:36:28,307
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you're welcome anytime.</font>

1187
01:36:29,768 --> 01:36:31,268
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I'd like that.</font>

1188
01:36:32,395 --> 01:36:33,555
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll be seeing you.</font>

1189
01:36:33,729 --> 01:36:36,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.
Soon, I hope.</font>

1190
01:36:38,984 --> 01:36:40,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm ready to be done
with this.</font>

1191
01:36:40,612 --> 01:36:42,742
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll never be done with it
no matter what.</font>

1192
01:36:42,905 --> 01:36:45,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's gonna haunt you, son,
for the rest of your days.</font>

1193
01:36:46,493 --> 01:36:48,243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you won't be alone.</font>

1194
01:36:48,411 --> 01:36:49,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's gonna haunt me, too.</font>

1195
01:36:50,121 --> 01:36:52,211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you stop by,
maybe I'll give you peace.</font>

1196
01:36:52,373 --> 01:36:56,253
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe.
Maybe I'll give it to you.</font>
