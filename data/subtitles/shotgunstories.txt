1
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:24,900
Kid.

2
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,300
Kid!

3
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:29,780
What?

4
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:31,700
Come on out.

5
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,500
What is it?

6
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,260
Annie's gone.

7
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:50,140
- Where'd she go?
- Left a note,

8
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:53,340
said she's gonna stay
with her mother for a while.

9
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,980
What'd you do?

10
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:59,660
I lost 200 at Tunaco last week.

11
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,220
- What about Carter?
- Took him.

12
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,420
Shit, man.

13
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:09,620
Yeah.

14
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,660
Well, you might as well move
back in the house for now.

15
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,220
All right.

16
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,100
What if she comes back?

17
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,020
Don't take the tent down.

18
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:29,300
Might be time for you to find
something else anyway.

19
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,060
I'm fine with it.

20
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:32,860
Well...

21
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,780
- We gonna tell Boy?
- What for?

22
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,620
You got front room, too.

23
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,220
Son of a bitch!

24
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,060
- Boy?
- Yeah?

25
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,260
Whatcha doin'?

26
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,260
Stereo's broke.

27
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,100
What's goin' on?

28
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,580
Told Kid he can
move back in the house.

29
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:25,900
What about Annie?

30
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,180
She'd gone to stay
with her mother for a while.

31
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:32,020
Told me to come by and see if
you wanna stay in the front room.

32
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,220
Why?

33
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,580
Get out of this van for a while.

34
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,860
Who said I needed out?

35
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,380
The Lord.

36
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:40,700
Shit.

37
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,000
Don't you get hot in here?

38
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,900
I got this the other day.

39
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,580
- Does it work?
- Well, I don't know.

40
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,860
I tried to run it through the cigarette lighter.

41
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:03,220
But it burnt something out and
that's why the stereo won't work now.

42
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:04,380
What's it doin'?

43
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,980
It just cuttin' and off whenever it wants...

44
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,420
I got a tape stuck in there right now.

45
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,540
Yeah?
I'm no good with stereos.

46
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,660
I gotta get to work.

47
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,580
Let me know if you
change your mind about the room.

48
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,580
Hey, if I come out to the house later,

49
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,640
can, uh... can I use the VCR?

50
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,020
If you bring some Juritos.

51
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,820
See that?

52
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,580
- What?
- On his back.

53
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:11,660
What is it?

54
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,960
Well, he got shot right
at the liquor store.

55
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,140
No shit?

56
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,960
Gettin' outta here?

57
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,020
Yeah.

58
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,540
Wanna get cheeseburger?

59
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:11,740
Can't really.

60
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:15,320
OK, drop me off, then.
Told Cheryl I'll meet her there.

61
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,500
All right.

62
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,180
See ya.

63
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,660
- What's up, Shampoo?
- A lot.

64
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,540
- What happened?
- Man, I had a little accident.

65
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,700
My place got fire yesterday.

66
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,780
- Shit.
- Yeah, man...

67
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:53,640
Cops been all over,
should've found plenty of evidence.

68
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:56,300
I'm livin' in this piece of shit now.

69
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,620
Is that your car?

70
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,660
Nah, it's my girlfriend's mom.

71
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,660
- Who's your girlfriend?
- You remember Cheryl Pruitt?

72
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:04,900
Really?

73
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,380
Lucky bastard.

74
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,500
Where you stayin'?

75
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:09,860
Over at Son's.

76
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,219
Oh, yeah? Think he'd let me park
my car over there? -When?

77
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,500
I don't know.
Now? Tonight?

78
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:21,220
I don't know, man. You don't need
that shit right now, you know?

79
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,620
Just wanna buy him.

80
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:23,940
I'll think about it.

81
00:08:23,941 --> 00:08:25,241
All right.

82
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,660
Bienvenidos, bitch.

83
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,020
What's up, darlin'?

84
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:37,060
- Who was that?
- Shampoo Douglas.

85
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,180
Really?

86
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:43,060
We had biology together.
He used to sniff formaldehyde.

87
00:08:43,061 --> 00:08:45,561
Yeah,

88
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,860
that's him.

89
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:07,660
Is this thing working?

90
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:10,500
I don't ever use that thing.

91
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:13,220
- What's the count?
- Plus 2.

92
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,580
This thing not workin'?

93
00:09:15,581 --> 00:09:17,481
Oh, geez...

94
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:20,260
- What's it now?
- Shut up...

95
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,140
Got it.

96
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:28,540
13 run us up all night.

97
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:30,860
Won't you get that?

98
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,340
Yeah.

99
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,220
- Your brother's here?
- Yeah.

100
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,860
- Both of them?
- Yeah.

101
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:53,500
Go get 'em.

102
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,780
It's Mom.

103
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:16,420
What is it?

104
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,780
Your father's dead.

105
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,460
When's the funeral?

106
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,140
You look in the paper.

107
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:33,900
You going?

108
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,700
No.

109
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,220
Friends, before I lead us
in the committal thoughts...

110
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:51,620
I want to simply offer the sentiment
I said at the church:

111
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:55,220
Cleaman was a man of faith...

112
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:59,140
and the most productive member
of this community.

113
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,740
So, in our last moments together...

114
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:05,300
each of us will have to
assess these feelings...

115
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,580
as they touch us individually.

116
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,160
Let us bow for prayer.

117
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:14,340
Brace us, Father,
lead us in these moments,

118
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:17,820
and especially bless this grieving family.
In Thy name, amen.

119
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:21,220
Now let us hear the words of David:

120
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:24,380
The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want.

121
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:28,520
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

122
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:34,420
- What do you think you're doing?
- I got something I wanna say.

123
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:36,380
Young man, what do you want?

124
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:40,700
- Sir, I'd like to say something.
- That's up to the family.

125
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,300
Let him talk.

126
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:04,040
I couldn't let you bury this man
without saying a few things first.

127
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:09,320
You're all here because you think
this was a good man.

128
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,620
But he wasn't.

129
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,940
Just 'cause he stopped drinkin',

130
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:20,220
called himself a Christian,
got a new life,

131
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,800
start a new family, that...

132
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,140
that don't make him a different man.

133
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,900
This is the same man...

134
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,780
that ran out on us.

135
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:36,940
Then left us behind to be raised
by a hateful woman.

136
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:42,180
He made like we were
never born.

137
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,860
That's who this man was.

138
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,820
And that's what he's
answering for today.

139
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,780
Stop, stop it!
Stop, not here...

140
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,020
Please, just go.

141
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:43,140
You could've told me
what you were gonna do.

142
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,500
If I'd known, I would've told you.

143
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,540
You should've known.

144
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:12,220
- Where is Mark?
- He's outside.

145
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,460
Is he all right?

146
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,620
He's doin' all right.

147
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,700
He was a different man, back then.

148
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:25,900
I know, Momma.

149
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,100
Take this.

150
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:41,140
Try and get some rest.

151
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,420
Thank you.

152
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,900
How is she doin'?

153
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,340
As good as can be expected.

154
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:24,260
She didn't deserve to hear that shit.

155
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,020
She's heard it before.

156
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:29,060
Not at his goddamn funeral.

157
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:31,660
Those three...

158
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,140
Like a pack of dogs.

159
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,260
You can't expect a dog
to have manners.

160
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,300
We'll see about that.

161
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:45,500
- You can't go out starting fights.
- I didn't start this.

162
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:50,180
We got responsibilities now, Mark.

163
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:54,140
Keep this farm up.
Hell, I got two kids to feed.

164
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:59,940
Besides, Stephen and John don't need
gettin' mixed up in anything like this.

165
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,660
You do what you want.

166
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:06,220
Steve and John are old enough
to make up their own minds.

167
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,100
Fucker.

168
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:41,820
What time is it?

169
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,620
About eight.

170
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,600
This is one empty ass town.

171
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:56,500
It's like we own it.

172
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:59,060
If I owned this town, I'd sell it.

173
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:03,180
We don't own a square root of shit.

174
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,380
Is that true?

175
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,860
What the hell is this?

176
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,820
Good morning, Annie.

177
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:40,140
What the hell is this? I'm gone a week
and you move them in?

178
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,500
I thought you left.

179
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,880
So this is how you've been missing me?

180
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,620
I have been missing you.

181
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:58,040
So, have you thought about
what you're gonna do? -Yeah.

182
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,420
Well?

183
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:01,660
I'm not stoppin'.

184
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,220
Damn it, Son.

185
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,100
Why'd you got that skillet for?

186
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:14,260
Look, I'm gonna make it
real simple for you.

187
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:17,380
Long you keep gambling,
the longer I stay gone.

188
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:20,580
It's not gambling,
it's a system.

189
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,420
I'm taking the skillet.

190
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,700
Wait a minute.

191
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,020
How's Carter?

192
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:41,780
He's fine.

193
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:46,340
You heard about my father?

194
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:48,820
He died.

195
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,540
It was past weekend.

196
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,740
Went to the funeral yesterday.

197
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:56,820
What happened?

198
00:19:58,580 --> 00:19:59,980
I said some things.

199
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,020
You think that was wise?

200
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,780
Doesn't matter.

201
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:10,220
I want to see Carter.
Take him out fishing.

202
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:12,680
- Where?
- The hell is it matter where?

203
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,180
I'll drop him off for you.

204
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,380
All right.

205
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,820
Saturday at 2.
Lake at dam.

206
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:30,480
You look good.

207
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:38,140
All right.
Let's get to work.

208
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,460
Where are you goin'?

209
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,700
Work.

210
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,340
Hey, coach.

211
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,260
Hey, guys.

212
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,760
- What's up?
- Not much.

213
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,320
Whacha been doin'?

214
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:28,700
Oh, just goin' over some plays.

215
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,460
Did you know that somebody wrote
"Suck it" on the back of your van?

216
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,180
They did?

217
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,020
I didn't know that.

218
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:39,020
Probably outta get that washed off.

219
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,740
Yeah, I probably should.

220
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,940
So, you wanna play some basketball?

221
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:46,240
No, but you guys go ahead.
I'm just gonna grab Henry.

222
00:21:46,241 --> 00:21:47,341
All right.

223
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:50,240
You guys need to work out
on overhanded lay-offs.

224
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:53,480
Remember those overhanded lay-offs
we were doin' on practice?

225
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,460
Go to van, Henry.

226
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,340
Fundamentals, guys, fundamentals!

227
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,320
Yeah, that was pretty good.

228
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,660
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

229
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:41,460
Did you hear Son got shot
robbin' a liquor store?

230
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:44,180
No, man, he got caught messin'
around with somebody's wife.

231
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,700
That's not what I heard.

232
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,980
Don't matter how he got shot,
he's about to get another one.

233
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:51,220
My cousin worked for Mark Hayes.

234
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:54,100
Said Son showed up at
Mark's daddy's funeral...

235
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:55,780
talkin' shit.

236
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:59,340
Mark Hayes.
That crazy son of a bitch.

237
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:04,100
Never met him.
I wouldn't know.

238
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,680
You wanna get some dinner?

239
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,660
No. I'm taking Cheryl out.

240
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,500
Where are you takin' her?

241
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:13,740
Buffet, probably.

242
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:14,900
Special!

243
00:23:15,201 --> 00:23:16,401
Yeah.

244
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:18,060
You need shirt?

245
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:22,620
Don't think so.
What are you doin'?

246
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:25,380
Me and Boy might get up to something.

247
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:30,020
You got a button-up?

248
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:31,620
Yeah, I got a button-up.

249
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:56,700
You promise?

250
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,500
Yeah.

251
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:03,980
I mean, I want to talk to my brothers
about it first, but...

252
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,260
Yeah.

253
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,500
I love you.

254
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,380
I love you, too.

255
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:26,060
I'll call you later.

256
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,660
Be sweet.

257
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:34,860
What are you doin'?

258
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,980
Watching you being a stud.

259
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:41,180
- You sleep out here?
- No, I ain't been to bed yet.

260
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:43,660
Wanna get some breakfast?

261
00:24:43,661 --> 00:24:44,861
Yeah.

262
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:46,340
Where's Henry?

263
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:48,660
I tied him up out back last night.

264
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,540
I need a burrito.

265
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:52,820
Let's do it.

266
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,020
Seen my wallet?

267
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:59,780
What about full-court man-to-man?

268
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,940
No, man-to-man's no good.

269
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:04,980
Depends too much on how you
size up against the other team.

270
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,660
I think we gotta go with, like, a zone.

271
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:11,060
Full-court press so we can practice
some running against anybody.

272
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:14,900
I thought you ran one of those
last year?

273
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:18,180
Well, I took a defense off
Nolan Richardson,

274
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:21,600
but, I dunno,
we didn't have the depth to run it.

275
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:24,060
Yeah, that's always been your weakness.

276
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:25,260
What?

277
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:29,360
Well... I mean, it seems like
every game I ever been to your...

278
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,661
it's like the other team
is shooting layups.

279
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,340
Here, look at this.

280
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:37,300
Something I've been working on lately.

281
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,820
We set traps back here...

282
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,460
cut off the incoming pass.

283
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,740
Most of these kids can't
throw all the way down court...

284
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:48,040
so we bring up our five men.
We cut them off and grab that game.

285
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:49,700
Hey, Kid.

286
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,780
- What's up, Shampoo?
- Boy.

287
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:56,560
You talk to Son yet about me
parking my car over there?

288
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:57,660
Not yet.

289
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,100
Come on man, talk to him.

290
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,980
I'll talk to him
when I wanna talk to him.

291
00:26:01,281 --> 00:26:02,181
Shit.

292
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:04,700
Heard y'all caused a scene
over that funeral?

293
00:26:04,701 --> 00:26:05,301
Yeah?

294
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:07,420
Yeah, Mark Hayes is goin' on about it.

295
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,540
What'd he say?

296
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:11,600
He said he might have to
kick a little ass. -Said what?

297
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:14,000
Something about kicking y'all's ass.

298
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:17,300
You believe that shit?

299
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,140
I tell you what...

300
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:23,140
If you see him,
you tell him to come find me.

301
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:25,100
Shit, I don't see him!

302
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:51,180
What if I end up
cheatin' on her, though?

303
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:57,380
Well, you end up in a situation
where you're seein' two girls,

304
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:00,780
I guess you just gotta
love both of them.

305
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:04,940
What?

306
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,580
You gonna eat that?

307
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:13,780
I don't know, I start thinkin'
'bout houses and kids,

308
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,220
other women...

309
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:19,620
I see a nice bootie,
I'll still gonna look at it.

310
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,340
Whacha all doin'?

311
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,460
We're gonna see if this thing works.

312
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:35,660
Well, she runs.

313
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:38,420
- You found this thing?
- Yeah.

314
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,380
Damn, that's cold!

315
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,660
Cut it, cut it. Cut it!
Cut it.

316
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:12,940
See that? One fuel line looks
like that you got popped off.

317
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,620
- You know how to do it?
- No.

318
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:18,020
What are they teachin' you
at that college?

319
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:20,460
- Nothin' good.
- You hear that, John?

320
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,940
Here, take that.

321
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:26,660
You'd be better off
stickin' around here this fall.

322
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:29,860
That's good.

323
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,540
Good, you got it!

324
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:36,060
Deserves a cold beer.

325
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,700
Hey, y'all should know,

326
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:42,140
especially about the shit
that happened,

327
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:44,060
Dad was proud of you.

328
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,940
You know you have
to put a bobber on that?

329
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:57,060
I know.

330
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,100
Henry, let's go.

331
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:16,540
Pretty boy,
ready to catch some fish?

332
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:18,980
What's up, buddy?

333
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:22,240
Watch out for that net!
I'm just jokin'.

334
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:27,180
Your daddy was gonna fish without
the bobber, can you believe that?

335
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,580
OK, let's get up on that rock.

336
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:34,060
OK. Now wheel it in,
just a little bit.

337
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:37,140
OK, that's good. Now we're
just gonna let it sit out there.

338
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:41,020
Hey Carter, you want
your sandwich? -No.

339
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,740
I need to clean my van up.

340
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:50,660
How much do they charge you
to keep that here?

341
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:53,140
Nothing, I know a guy
who works up here.

342
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:59,860
I still can't figure
why you sleep in that thing.

343
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,260
Beats payin' rent.

344
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:04,020
If I had an apartment,
I'd have to get a summer job.

345
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:06,420
This way it's like early retirement.

346
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,980
It's like... bein' a bum.

347
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,820
- Look at this.
- You got an extra sandwich?

348
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:22,500
Shit, man...

349
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:26,100
I gotta get her back in the house.

350
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,180
You need to stop gamblin'.

351
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:30,060
It's not the gamblin'.

352
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:33,340
I mean, she says that's it,
but that's not it.

353
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:35,380
She just wants me to...

354
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:37,420
stop screwing around.

355
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:42,220
Bring home that paycheck.
Be happy makin' 20.000 a year.

356
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:44,220
I can do better than that.

357
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:48,020
Better for me, better for her.

358
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:54,580
You know, I used to be able to divide
up to four decimal points in my head.

359
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:00,300
Top two players
come out Arkansas?

360
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:03,020
Sydney Moncrief

361
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,580
and Corliss Williamson.

362
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:05,940
What about Joe Johnson?

363
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:08,460
Nah, he don't play a year and a half.

364
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,780
I can fix that.

365
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:25,620
I can take that out for you.

366
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:27,340
What'll I listen to?

367
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:45,540
Hey.
Yeah, it's me.

368
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:54,100
So, I figure I drop them off to you,
about an hour.

369
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,740
You should put some rams on this thing.

370
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:59,060
I would if I had the money.

371
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:03,820
Thinkin' about puttin'
some lights up underneath.

372
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:05,860
That'd be tough, too.

373
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:07,300
Yeah, all right.

374
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:24,020
I gotta get some more quarters.

375
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:34,220
Watch Carter...

376
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:36,780
That your boy?

377
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:39,660
Stay here.

378
00:32:41,061 --> 00:32:42,161
Yeah.

379
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:44,740
Wonder how he's gonna take it
when I give a speech at your funeral?

380
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,900
We didn't get a chance to talk
the other day.

381
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,420
We tried to catch up with you,
but you all ran out of there too fast...

382
00:32:56,421 --> 00:32:57,921
like you might have been scared
or something.

383
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,900
I said what I needed to say.

384
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:02,020
You gonna have a problem with that?

385
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:05,700
Yeah, we're gonna have
a problem with it.

386
00:33:05,701 --> 00:33:07,201
Let's not do this.

387
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:08,620
What'd you say?

388
00:33:14,021 --> 00:33:15,321
Boy!

389
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:29,340
We'll see you.

390
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,380
Come on, boy.

391
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:44,320
- What's your deal?
- What?

392
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:46,460
Where the hell were you back--

393
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:17,660
- C'mon, bud. -See you.
- See you, buddy.

394
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:27,740
So what's your fuckin' problem?

395
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:35,440
- So, I'll see you soon.
- OK.

396
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:42,700
Is Annie here?

397
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:45,780
No, she's out.

398
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:53,020
- Bye, Son.
- Bye.

399
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:09,700
So what are we gonna do?

400
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:11,860
Nothin'.

401
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:14,540
That ain't gonna be
the end of it. -I know.

402
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:18,740
So just say it. I'll go
over his house and beat him.

403
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:20,460
- Calm down.
- What?

404
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:21,740
I said, calm down.

405
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:25,460
Calm down? Is that what you
were doing back there, being calm?

406
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,260
'Cause it sure as hell wasn't
you being scared, was it?

407
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:29,140
- Fuck you.
- Pussy!

408
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:30,340
Stop it!

409
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:36,460
I don't want you messin'
with Mark Hayes.

410
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:39,220
That's just what he's lookin' for.
You see him, you stay away from him.

411
00:35:39,221 --> 00:35:40,221
You hear me?

412
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:52,260
But that's the last time
you ever stay out of the fight.

413
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:58,700
Let's go.

414
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,900
We need to talk.

415
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:46,500
You'd do well to get out
of my property.

416
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,820
This fight I heard about -
I don't wanna see any more of that.

417
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:53,460
You should talk to
your brothers about that.

418
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:54,620
I have.

419
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:56,980
Now I'm tellin' you.

420
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:01,260
Before too long, somebody's life will
get hurt and it might be one of yours.

421
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:04,940
Listen here.

422
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:07,700
I don't like you.

423
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,240
I don't like your family.

424
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:17,220
And if anything happens to one of
my brothers, I'll come after all of ya.

425
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:19,540
So, that's it?

426
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:20,700
That's it.

427
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:04,340
Hey.

428
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:06,180
Hey.

429
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:11,380
That your kids?

430
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:14,940
Two of them. Er, one of 'em
just moved here.

431
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:28,740
Are we all right?

432
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,100
Yeah.

433
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:41,340
Can you help me with something?

434
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:43,620
What?

435
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,060
Hold on, guys!
Hold on.

436
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:54,460
What's goin' on?
It's not that hard!

437
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:58,020
I'm sorry.
It's my boots.

438
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:00,340
Ah, forget it.

439
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,580
What about this one:

440
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:10,420
Best ballplayer
that ever act in a movie

441
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:12,420
that wasn't about sports?

442
00:39:13,421 --> 00:39:14,421
Oh, geez...

443
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:19,700
Well, there's Wilt Chamberlain
in "Conan the Destroyer".

444
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:21,300
You got...

445
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:25,460
Kareem in a Bruce Lee's
"The Game of Death".

446
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:29,540
I think Barkley did a voice in
"Fievel Goes West".

447
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:32,380
- Is that true?
- Yeah.

448
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:38,660
Where's Henry?

449
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:41,380
I put him up behind the Son's
last night.

450
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:47,420
They had a fight at work,
that's how he got shot.

451
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:54,060
One guy say he got while he was
cheatin' on Annie.

452
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:55,340
That's not true.

453
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:06,180
Cheryl's here.

454
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:09,540
Look, she got you a burger.

455
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:01,740
You guys heard the, uh,

456
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:04,340
new Aguilera single,
"Car Wash"?

457
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,380
Did you talk
to your brothers yet?

458
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:09,820
Talked to Boy some.

459
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:12,660
Haven't talked to Son yet.

460
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:18,620
I found out about that raise
on Thursday.

461
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:21,740
You know I don't care about that.

462
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,020
I know...

463
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:29,740
We'll see.

464
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:43,860
I think you got the right shot,
you head there.

465
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:49,780
Hold it!

466
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:05,300
Go get one of those sacks
out of the back of my truck.

467
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:08,220
- What are you doing?
- I wanna catch that snake.

468
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:10,940
What do you need that snake for?

469
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:32,900
Is Boy here?

470
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:35,660
You just missed him.

471
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:37,740
He left Henry?

472
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:41,460
Yeah, he says it's getting
too hot for him in the van.

473
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:45,140
It's too hot for his dog,
but he'll sleep in it.

474
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:48,060
He couldn't get that
window unit grunt in there.

475
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:52,860
That's a shame.

476
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:55,580
What you've been up to?

477
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:58,020
Spent a day at Tunaco.

478
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:00,580
- How'd you do?
- Ah, broke even, pretty much.

479
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:03,060
I'm being close to figuring that out.

480
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:05,340
You'll get it.

481
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:12,940
You still love Annie?

482
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:17,180
More than ever.

483
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:19,260
Even with her
livin' at her mother's?

484
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:21,300
Yeah.

485
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:27,300
I think I might ask Cheryl
to marry me.

486
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:31,260
All right.

487
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:36,060
Told her if I got that raise at Keo,
I'll put a ring on her finger.

488
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:37,180
That sounds good.

489
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:43,780
I worry about
taking care of her, though.

490
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:48,180
I mean, I don't have a truck,

491
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:51,060
I don't have a house.

492
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:54,580
Hell, I sleep in a damn tent.

493
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:57,180
That shit's hard.

494
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:02,420
I mean,
a lifetime is a long time.

495
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:04,220
Just for two people.

496
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:15,700
I don't even know if I can
stay faithful to her.

497
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:24,740
You just got to decide
if she's the one you're gonna love,

498
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:26,500
and love her.

499
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:30,500
Everything else
will take care of itself.

500
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:37,300
Yeah.

501
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:41,700
You're gonna be all right.

502
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:40,060
Henry!

503
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:42,380
Chow time!

504
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:51,420
Henry?

505
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:12,020
Jesus Christ...

506
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:15,780
We gotta clean this place up.

507
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:17,940
We got problem.

508
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:19,980
- What's that?
- It's Henry.

509
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:53,900
- What's up?
- Hey.

510
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:56,020
We need to talk.

511
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:57,700
What's wrong?

512
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:09,220
It's about Henry...

513
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:10,380
What?

514
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:12,940
Henry's dead.

515
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:17,940
Kid found him this morning.
Snake bit.

516
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:22,380
Said he curled up at his water
bowl. Bit him on the nose.

517
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:23,700
Shit.

518
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:27,980
Kid found it,
cut its head off with a shovel.

519
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:33,100
Sorry.

520
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:00,500
What?

521
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:02,620
Man, I wanna park my car
here tonight.

522
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:05,180
- No.
- C'mon, man!

523
00:48:05,281 --> 00:48:06,281
No.

524
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:08,060
It's cool. I got this tarp, man.

525
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:09,540
Nobody'll see it's mine.

526
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:12,340
You're just gonna have
to talk to Son.

527
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:13,500
Yeah, all right.

528
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:15,220
What are you doin'?

529
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:18,260
Give me a hand with this, man,
it's just until Son gets back.

530
00:48:18,361 --> 00:48:19,561
No...

531
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:21,780
Son had to get to tell Boy
his dog's dead.

532
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:23,020
Yeah, I heard about that.

533
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:25,060
What?

534
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:26,660
Snake bit, right?

535
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:30,220
Yeah.
How'd you know that?

536
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:32,540
I heard Stephen Hayes
talkin' about it.

537
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:33,980
What'd he say?

538
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:36,780
Said his brother Mark's the one
who put the snake back there.

539
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:38,260
What?

540
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:40,020
Everybody knows that.

541
00:48:40,220 --> 00:48:42,580
You're sayin' Mark Hayes
killed Boy's dog?

542
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:44,420
That's what I'm sayin'.

543
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:45,900
You know where he's at?

544
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:48,100
He's probably still at the bar.

545
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:51,140
Let's go.

546
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:53,140
Damn!

547
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:56,700
Mark Hayes!

548
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:58,380
Hey.

549
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:00,940
They let you off the farm
for the day, huh?

550
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:02,100
Yeah.

551
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:05,140
- How the hell you've been?
- All right.

552
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:08,060
- Rain's help.
- Yeah, skyin' up.

553
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:09,380
Got a light?

554
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:11,980
I don't, man.
I finally quit cigarettes, I think.

555
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:20,060
Get out of here.

556
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:30,380
You like snakes, Mark?

557
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:45,940
What should we do?

558
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:48,420
I figured we bury him
in the back yard.

559
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:50,620
Kid started a hole.

560
00:49:58,221 --> 00:50:00,021
Hello?

561
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:14,020
That cop over there says
Mark Hayes is dead.

562
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:18,620
Kid busted his scull open.

563
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:24,460
After he gets of out here,
he's gonna have to answer for it.

564
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:38,420
You are Son Hayes?

565
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:39,700
Yes, sir.

566
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:43,780
I'm sorry,
your brother is dead.

567
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:49,020
We, uh...
We did all we possibly could.

568
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:54,340
I'm really sorry.

569
00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:57,660
There'll be someone
down here shortly...

570
00:50:57,761 --> 00:51:01,261
to help you make
arrangements for the body.

571
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:40,740
I gotta get back inside,
talk to this person.

572
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:42,940
OK.

573
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:50,740
Would you go by Annie's mom,
let her know?

574
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:52,660
Yeah, I will.

575
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:58,780
Somebody's gonna have
to tell Cheryl.

576
00:52:06,981 --> 00:52:07,981
Hey...

577
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:15,820
I'll see you at home.

578
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:55,620
- Son?
- Yes, sir?

579
00:54:56,380 --> 00:54:59,460
- Wanna take some time off?
- No.

580
00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:00,860
You're sure?

581
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:04,620
This is what I do.

582
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:07,420
That doesn't mean it's gonna be
some time off.

583
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:10,500
I'll be here.

584
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:13,140
All right. If you change
your mind, let me know.

585
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:14,620
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

586
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:37,740
You been doin' OK?

587
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:47,020
You call me if you
need anything, OK?

588
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:48,860
Yeah, all right.

589
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:06,820
You happy now? You happy
now that my brother's dead?

590
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:08,080
Just calm down, all right?

591
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:10,780
You should never come
to that funeral...

592
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:14,540
You started all of this.

593
00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:17,540
This started a long time ago.

594
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:20,380
It's OK.

595
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:25,580
Somebody's got to finish it.

596
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:54,500
Son.

597
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:55,940
Hey.

598
00:58:01,180 --> 00:58:02,940
Sorry I didn't make it to the funeral.

599
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:05,100
Yeah. Thanks.

600
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:07,540
What did the cops had to say?

601
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:10,380
Said that Kid and Mark
killed each other.

602
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:12,980
They didn't say nothing
about Stephen and John?

603
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:14,660
Why would they?

604
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:16,020
They were there.

605
00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:17,500
Who says?

606
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:18,820
I was there.

607
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:21,660
What happened?

608
00:58:22,460 --> 00:58:25,700
Well, after Mark went down,
you know, Kid was kicking him,

609
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:28,820
John and Stephen
came out of the bar.

610
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:32,260
Stephen then overtackled Kid.

611
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:34,460
They were wrestling
on the ground for a while.

612
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:37,940
Knife came out.
It all happened really fast.

613
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:39,180
They helped him?

614
00:58:39,281 --> 00:58:42,281
Like I said, man,
it happened really fast.

615
00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:44,400
I figured the cops
are about to shop up,

616
00:58:44,401 --> 00:58:45,801
so I got the hell out there.

617
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:49,660
I don't know, man...

618
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:54,420
It's really too bad.
You know, Kid was all right.

619
00:58:56,980 --> 00:58:58,060
I'll see y'all.

620
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:07,420
I didn't know they were there.

621
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:41,020
What was that?

622
00:59:52,140 --> 00:59:53,500
What was that?

623
00:59:57,020 --> 00:59:58,060
Nothing.

624
01:00:37,620 --> 01:00:39,500
I guess you heard by now.

625
01:00:44,580 --> 01:00:48,620
You raised us to hate
those boys, and we do.

626
01:00:48,740 --> 01:00:50,460
And now it's come to this.

627
01:01:55,180 --> 01:01:56,580
- Hey, John?
- Yeah?

628
01:01:57,140 --> 01:01:58,980
Could you hold this just a minute?

629
01:02:14,060 --> 01:02:15,980
I need you at the shop.

630
01:02:16,181 --> 01:02:17,181
OK.

631
01:02:17,980 --> 01:02:19,420
Give me a minute.

632
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:26,180
Steve, what are you up to?

633
01:02:29,820 --> 01:02:31,020
This damn thing.

634
01:02:32,340 --> 01:02:34,460
Changed the fuel line on it.

635
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:36,980
Still stallin' out.

636
01:02:38,260 --> 01:02:39,780
I'm gonna take John and the boys.

637
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:42,660
I'll swing by later,
take a look at it.

638
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:47,300
John tells me you ran into
Son Hayes yesterday?

639
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:50,900
Yeah.

640
01:02:51,380 --> 01:02:54,660
- You exchange words with him?
- Yeah.

641
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:57,500
I don't wanna hear any more
about that.

642
01:02:59,420 --> 01:03:02,700
I'm not willin' to lose any more
of my family in this fight.

643
01:03:05,180 --> 01:03:07,180
I'll see you at the house
for supper.

644
01:04:25,260 --> 01:04:26,260
Boy!

645
01:04:42,060 --> 01:04:43,060
You're OK?

646
01:04:44,660 --> 01:04:46,580
Yeah. It's just my radio.

647
01:04:48,060 --> 01:04:49,620
Still not workin'?

648
01:04:49,980 --> 01:04:51,020
No.

649
01:04:54,780 --> 01:04:57,860
I can't stop thinking about
what Shampoo said...

650
01:04:57,980 --> 01:05:00,460
about them other two
boys being there.

651
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:07,020
It used to be,
when I see them Hayes boys,

652
01:05:07,140 --> 01:05:08,900
I'd just see our old man, but...

653
01:05:10,260 --> 01:05:11,820
Now, with Kid...

654
01:05:16,460 --> 01:05:18,700
They can take our daddy.

655
01:05:19,820 --> 01:05:21,060
Good riddance!

656
01:05:23,100 --> 01:05:24,980
But they ain't takin' Kid...

657
01:05:27,860 --> 01:05:29,420
They ain't takin' Kid.

658
01:05:31,340 --> 01:05:33,020
What are you gonna do?

659
01:05:34,060 --> 01:05:36,080
I don't know,
I'm gonna go after them.

660
01:05:36,081 --> 01:05:37,781
I gotta get done with this.

661
01:05:38,540 --> 01:05:41,100
- Annie's not gonna like it.
- Well, I don't like it either.

662
01:05:43,620 --> 01:05:45,180
You want me to come with you?

663
01:05:47,180 --> 01:05:49,220
I just wanted you to know.

664
01:06:11,140 --> 01:06:12,420
Let's go, boys!

665
01:07:08,300 --> 01:07:09,300
What do you want?

666
01:07:14,980 --> 01:07:16,660
Getting on my property.

667
01:07:22,100 --> 01:07:23,460
What truck is that?

668
01:07:29,740 --> 01:07:30,900
Hell!

669
01:07:36,580 --> 01:07:37,580
Son!

670
01:07:38,060 --> 01:07:39,060
Stop it!

671
01:07:41,220 --> 01:07:42,500
Stop!

672
01:08:23,220 --> 01:08:25,700
- Does that feel OK?
- Yeah.

673
01:08:27,700 --> 01:08:28,700
Where's my brother?

674
01:08:28,860 --> 01:08:31,700
He's upstairs.
He's still unconscious.

675
01:08:35,260 --> 01:08:38,500
They wanna talk with you downstairs
about your insurance.

676
01:08:38,580 --> 01:08:39,620
All right.

677
01:09:03,180 --> 01:09:04,980
Why is this happening?

678
01:10:11,900 --> 01:10:13,100
Can I help you?

679
01:10:13,660 --> 01:10:15,340
I need one of these guns.

680
01:10:37,140 --> 01:10:38,420
Oh, Jesus...

681
01:10:40,100 --> 01:10:43,100
So, no one's ever
taken you huntin'? -No.

682
01:10:43,860 --> 01:10:45,180
That's too bad.

683
01:10:45,300 --> 01:10:47,540
Son never let us have guns.

684
01:10:52,980 --> 01:10:54,220
Just take that off...

685
01:10:55,020 --> 01:10:57,180
and this just slides right on.

686
01:11:02,660 --> 01:11:05,580
And you screw this back on.
You got the shells?

687
01:11:16,940 --> 01:11:20,900
Gettin' a fishy condition
'cause of plug in here...

688
01:11:21,980 --> 01:11:24,060
so it can only fit 3 shells.

689
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:26,300
But I'll take that out for ya,

690
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:27,900
don't worry about it.

691
01:11:36,060 --> 01:11:38,020
You try it out on a tire.

692
01:11:43,540 --> 01:11:44,980
That's got a kick to it.

693
01:12:44,060 --> 01:12:45,060
Hey!

694
01:13:00,220 --> 01:13:01,260
Y'all get back!

695
01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:06,820
Paul, take your brother
to the back!

696
01:13:44,740 --> 01:13:47,540
Still call me if anything
changes? -Of course.

697
01:13:47,700 --> 01:13:49,780
Go home, take a break.

698
01:13:49,940 --> 01:13:52,140
- You need some rest.
- I know.

699
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:57,340
Hey Mom, you stay here,
watch Carter for just a second.

700
01:13:57,341 --> 01:13:58,341
I'll be right back.

701
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:01,220
Hey baby, stay here with
grandma, OK? Be right back.

702
01:14:13,620 --> 01:14:15,700
- Do you mind?
- No, go ahead.

703
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:28,460
Here to see Son?

704
01:14:30,020 --> 01:14:31,020
I don't know.

705
01:14:36,220 --> 01:14:37,460
Why do you have that?

706
01:14:42,140 --> 01:14:44,140
I was gonna kill Cleaman Hayes.

707
01:14:47,660 --> 01:14:50,180
Nothing good can come
from killing that man.

708
01:14:50,380 --> 01:14:52,900
If Son wakes up out of this,
this fight ain't done.

709
01:14:53,020 --> 01:14:54,620
He'll kill them himself to finish it.

710
01:14:54,860 --> 01:14:55,860
You don't know that.

711
01:14:56,060 --> 01:14:58,220
He's been shot before
protecting us.

712
01:15:00,820 --> 01:15:01,820
I know.

713
01:15:08,460 --> 01:15:10,300
Son's all I have now.

714
01:15:11,140 --> 01:15:13,100
I just wanna protect my brother.

715
01:15:15,060 --> 01:15:16,100
I know.

716
01:15:17,580 --> 01:15:19,140
What are you gonna do?

717
01:15:22,580 --> 01:15:24,380
I wanna put an end to it.

718
01:16:55,620 --> 01:16:56,620
Wait, wait!

719
01:16:56,630 --> 01:16:58,200
- Hold on!
- What the hell are you doing?

720
01:16:58,260 --> 01:17:00,460
Get down, you son of a bitch!

721
01:17:01,780 --> 01:17:03,180
Steve, he don't got a gun!

722
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:05,740
Back off, Stephen.

723
01:17:07,260 --> 01:17:08,260
Stop it!

724
01:17:13,180 --> 01:17:14,340
I just came to talk.

725
01:17:14,580 --> 01:17:16,860
Give me one reason
I don't kill you right now.

726
01:17:17,980 --> 01:17:19,380
I'm done with this.

727
01:17:19,540 --> 01:17:20,580
What?

728
01:17:21,540 --> 01:17:23,980
- I want it to stop.
- It's gonna stop.

729
01:17:25,980 --> 01:17:27,460
You got two boys, right?

730
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:29,180
What about it?

731
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:32,560
Son's got his boy, Carter.

732
01:17:33,361 --> 01:17:36,161
And one day I'm gonna
have some of my own.

733
01:17:38,740 --> 01:17:40,300
I just wanna protect my family.

734
01:17:41,580 --> 01:17:43,140
Why should I trust you?

735
01:17:45,180 --> 01:17:48,740
You can shoot me if you want,
but I'm done fightin'.

736
01:18:06,300 --> 01:18:07,380
Back off, Stephen.

737
01:18:07,740 --> 01:18:09,100
This ain't right.

738
01:18:10,700 --> 01:18:12,700
Put the gun down,
he's unarmed.

739
01:18:15,220 --> 01:18:17,560
You shoot him here like this
and they'll put you away.

740
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:20,260
We got a chance to stop all this,
now put the gun down.

741
01:18:24,380 --> 01:18:26,420
I don't wanna see you here
ever again.

742
01:18:38,020 --> 01:18:39,020
Wait.

743
01:18:40,060 --> 01:18:42,580
What if Son wakes up and
doesn't see things this way?

744
01:18:46,900 --> 01:18:48,480
Better hope he does.

745
01:20:59,380 --> 01:21:01,140
- Take this.
- But I'm covered.

746
01:21:01,300 --> 01:21:04,260
Just take it.
You'll need some traveling money.

747
01:21:04,380 --> 01:21:05,420
Thanks.

748
01:21:06,420 --> 01:21:09,700
You think he'll be all right? -He'll
be all right, just give him some time.

749
01:21:10,300 --> 01:21:11,300
Come here.

750
01:21:45,220 --> 01:21:47,740
All right. Freeze, guys!
That's what I'm talkin' about!

751
01:21:47,900 --> 01:21:50,020
That's how you run
full-court press.

752
01:22:54,721 --> 01:22:58,021
<i>Drunk by noon on New Year's Day</i>

753
01:22:58,022 --> 01:23:02,422
<i>in the hills outside of town someplace</i>

754
01:23:02,923 --> 01:23:05,023
<i>with the smoke and the wine</i>

755
01:23:07,324 --> 01:23:09,324
<i>and a stranger's eyes</i>

756
01:23:11,825 --> 01:23:15,425
<i>Smoke and the wine
and the whiskey don't mix</i>

757
01:23:15,526 --> 01:23:19,426
<i>Shakin' so bad,
think I'm gonna be sick</i>

758
01:23:20,027 --> 01:23:23,627
<i>Buy another scotch
as I head to the door</i>

759
01:23:23,828 --> 01:23:26,628
<i>and it won't make it better</i>

760
01:23:28,029 --> 01:23:30,529
<i>but I wanna make sure</i>

761
01:23:33,030 --> 01:23:36,530
<i>Hold me close</i>

762
01:23:37,331 --> 01:23:40,631
<i>I love you more than you know</i>

763
01:23:41,232 --> 01:23:43,132
<i>And I step outside</i>

764
01:24:07,033 --> 01:24:10,533
<i>Drank away all of my
fears and my doubts</i>

765
01:24:11,334 --> 01:24:14,634
<i>Stole away hearts
from town to town</i>

766
01:24:14,835 --> 01:24:17,035
<i>Now the things I fear</i>

767
01:24:19,836 --> 01:24:21,536
<i>come back here</i>

768
01:24:24,237 --> 01:24:27,537
<i>Feel the cold ground
underneath my boots</i>

769
01:24:28,238 --> 01:24:31,738
<i>at no good reason
it reminds me of you</i>

770
01:24:32,539 --> 01:24:36,039
<i>Never made good,
though I tried and I tried</i>

771
01:24:36,140 --> 01:24:39,140
<i>so I turn back around</i>

772
01:24:41,541 --> 01:24:43,341
<i>and walk inside</i>

773
01:24:45,542 --> 01:24:48,842
<i>Hold me close</i>

774
01:24:49,943 --> 01:24:52,943

<i>I love you more than you know</i>

777
01:25:01,846 --> 01:25:05,346
