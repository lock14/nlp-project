1
00:03:10,983 --> 00:03:15,027
Temperature-wise, pretty cold.
Uh, six, seven degrees...

2
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:17,655
which is, uh 
what is it in Fahrenheit?

3
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:19,657
I don't know. Forty-something?

4
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:25,454
If anybody has a nice formula,
then they can write in and tell me, after this...

5
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:29,333
so I know how to transform
Fahrenheit into centigrade 

6
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:35,548
Dropping lines to the program...

7
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:40,428
I have to say, uh, a big thank you to, uh 

8
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:55,711
...the dirty protest and the blanket
protest, which has been going on for years...

9
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:58,839
all in support of the same demand:
political status.

10
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:01,258
That is to say, different treatment...

11
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:04,387
for people who commit crimes 
hideous crimes

12
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:06,847
for what they... claim
to be a political motive.

13
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:09,016
And that is what the government
will not grant.

14
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:59,483
About an hour later, there's a bit of thumping
and banging coming from the granny's room.

15
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:02,153
So the da walks up to the granny's room,
and he opens the door...

16
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:04,739
and there's a wee fella having a go at the granny.

17
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:08,325
And the wee fella turns round and goes,
"See? It's not so fucking funny when it's your ma!"

18
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:27,942
There is no such thing as political murder...

19
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:31,403
political bombing or political violence.

20
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:35,407
There is only criminal murder,
criminal bombing and criminal violence.

21
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:41,080
We will not compromise on this.

22
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:44,041
There will be no political status.

23
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:19,618
I will not wear the uniform of a criminal.

24
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:22,705
I demand to wear me own clothes.

25
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:00,566
What?

26
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:07,197
What is it your surname is again?

27
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,867
- Gillen.
- Gillen.

28
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:12,411
Aye.

29
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:15,414
Fancy Quinn?

30
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:20,335
Falls Road. Fancy Quinn.
Do you know him?

31
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,673
- No.
- No?

32
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:33,974
- How long did you get?
- Twelve years.

33
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,938
You?

34
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:45,485
Six years. Six.

35
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,362
Six?

36
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,448
Aye.

37
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:54,036
You lucky bastard.

38
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:17,275
- Hi.
- How are you?

39
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,360
- Okay.
- Okay?

40
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:19,611
- Yeah.
- How's Ma?

41
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:25,945
It's by a former political adviser to Mervyn Rees
when he was at the Home Office...

42
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,530
Roger Darlington.

43
00:23:27,615 --> 00:23:29,741
He rejects the official line on phone taps...

44
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:32,660
that there's only been
a modest overall increase...

45
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:36,456
and says Parliament has no way of knowing
how much tapping goes on...

46
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,833
because the prime minister
and other senior ministers...

47
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:42,378
don't even have to get warrants
to get a tap put into effect.

48
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,506
What?

49
00:26:33,217 --> 00:26:35,218
Get ready.

50
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:57,091
Fuck!

51
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:23,589
She sends her very, very best to you.

52
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:29,303
Are you all right, Bobby?

53
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:31,389
I'm grand, Ma.

54
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:35,268
Are they giving you treatment for that?

55
00:31:35,352 --> 00:31:37,353
It's being looked after.

56
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:42,233
And the young fella?

57
00:31:43,569 --> 00:31:45,570
He's a handful. I'll tell you that.

58
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:50,199
- Are you eating all right?
- I'm grand, Ma.

59
00:31:50,284 --> 00:31:53,869
- Are they feeding you all right?
- Don't yous be worrying about me.

60
00:31:56,748 --> 00:32:02,086
Five minutes.

61
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:06,549
- You eating all right?
- Aye.

62
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:09,093
- Tastes like shit though, doesn't it?
- You get used to it.

63
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,517
You're looking well.

64
00:32:18,854 --> 00:32:21,689
So are you, Son. So are you.

65
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:31,365
The eyes of the Lord are on the righteous...

66
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:34,285
and his ears are attentive to their cries.

67
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:37,997
The face of the Lord
is against those who do evil.

68
00:32:39,249 --> 00:32:42,668
The righteous cry out,
and the Lord hears them.

69
00:32:42,753 --> 00:32:46,088
He delivers them from all their troubles.

70
00:32:46,173 --> 00:32:48,382
The Lord is close to the brokenhearted...

71
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:51,427
and saves those who are crushed in spirit.

72
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:54,930
The righteous man has many troubles...

73
00:32:55,015 --> 00:32:57,850
but the Lord delivers him from them all.

74
00:32:57,934 --> 00:32:59,977
He protects all his bones...

75
00:33:00,062 --> 00:33:03,898
and not one of them will be broken.

76
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:07,443
Evil will slay the wicked.

77
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:11,489
The foes of the righteous
will be condemned.

78
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:13,824
The Lord redeems his servants.

79
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:18,663
No one will be condemned
who finds refuge in him.

80
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:27,672
Let us pray.

81
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:46,453
Fucking shoes matches the wall.

82
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:31,373
- Fucking dirty bastards!
- Fucking bastards!

83
00:37:31,458 --> 00:37:33,792
Fucking dirty bastards!

84
00:37:33,877 --> 00:37:36,170
Fucking bullshit!

85
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:42,635
Bastards!

86
00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:58,817
I  I ” I.R.A.!

87
00:37:58,902 --> 00:38:02,237
I  I ” I.R.A.! I ” I ”

88
00:38:02,322 --> 00:38:04,615
Fucking bastards!

89
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:55,416
Everything in order?

90
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,335
- Yes, sir. In order, sir.
- Very good.

91
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:51,865
Gerry! Gerry!

92
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:01,291
Gerry!

93
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:22,229
Get the fuck off me!

94
00:41:28,278 --> 00:41:30,320
Shit. Shit!

95
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,616
Don't kill me!

96
00:41:37,537 --> 00:41:39,454
You bastards, you!

97
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:15,991
Get off me, you bastards! Off me!

98
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:25,751
You'll be fuckin' dead for this!

99
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:35,385
Fuckin' 

100
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:19,406
Tea with two sugars, please.

101
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,408
Oh. I'll get it for you. Just a minute.

102
00:44:27,332 --> 00:44:29,333
Hi, Mum.

103
00:44:41,262 --> 00:44:43,263
What are you doing sitting in here?

104
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:14,461
Daisies.

105
00:46:07,807 --> 00:46:09,724
You can sit down anytime you like.

106
00:46:09,809 --> 00:46:12,727
Priest etiquette. Never sit before you're asked.

107
00:46:12,812 --> 00:46:16,398
- Sit down then.
- Don't want to come over too eager.

108
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:18,733
What, best to hover at the door?

109
00:46:18,818 --> 00:46:22,112
You learn that
your first week in the seminary, Bobby.

110
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:29,161
Cig?

111
00:46:29,245 --> 00:46:31,246
Come on.

112
00:46:34,834 --> 00:46:37,419
Bit of a break from smoking the Bible, eh?

113
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:39,504
Oh, aye.

114
00:46:42,467 --> 00:46:45,427
Anyone work out which book is the best smoke?

115
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:47,762
We only smoke the Lamentations.

116
00:46:47,847 --> 00:46:50,348
A right miserable cigarette.

117
00:46:50,433 --> 00:46:52,601
Nice room.

118
00:46:52,685 --> 00:46:54,644
Very clean.

119
00:46:54,729 --> 00:46:57,898
- Where is it you're from again, Dom?
- Born, you mean?

120
00:46:57,982 --> 00:47:00,609
- Bally-go-backwards?
- Oh, the city dog.

121
00:47:00,693 --> 00:47:05,113
- Ballyroberts.
- A wee place south of Ballymoney. Kilrea.

122
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:09,409
I remember a homily
you did at mass one time.

123
00:47:09,494 --> 00:47:11,828
Oh, will you listen to it?

124
00:47:11,913 --> 00:47:15,123
- Sure, the men hold you in very high esteem.
- I can feel a dig coming on.

125
00:47:15,208 --> 00:47:17,417
- You're very quick.
- Right.

126
00:47:17,502 --> 00:47:19,669
Nah, you're respected. You know that.

127
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:22,839
But I like those stories
you tell about the countryside.

128
00:47:22,924 --> 00:47:25,091
A childhood of poaching, robbing apples...

129
00:47:25,176 --> 00:47:27,093
stampeding cattle.

130
00:47:27,178 --> 00:47:30,805
- Fine education for a priest.
- A priest working in West Belfast, it is, yeah.

131
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:32,849
Stampeding comes in handy
down the Falls Road.

132
00:47:32,934 --> 00:47:35,393
- R.U.C. hate me.
- You miss it though.

133
00:47:35,478 --> 00:47:37,437
- What?
- Countryside.

134
00:47:37,522 --> 00:47:40,732
Ah, sure. I get home to see
my wee brother every month or so, but, uh...

135
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:44,945
aye, I miss the usual 
clean air, space ” all that.

136
00:47:45,029 --> 00:47:47,405
- Feels closer to who you are.
- Aye. Well, it is.

137
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:49,491
No question.

138
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:54,162
Something like a fish out of water
working in a big city like Belfast, but, uh...

139
00:47:54,247 --> 00:47:56,248
it's a job, isn't it?

140
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:59,334
You stop looking around
at your surroundings quick enough...

141
00:47:59,418 --> 00:48:03,338
when you figure your business
is the business of the soul and all.

142
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:05,507
- Business of the soul?
- Ah, you know what I mean.

143
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:10,178
- Learn that in the seminary too?
- Aye. And you can use that free of charge.

144
00:48:10,263 --> 00:48:12,305
Go on.

145
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:14,683
Well, I suppose what I'm saying is...

146
00:48:14,767 --> 00:48:16,685
you get on.

147
00:48:16,769 --> 00:48:19,145
Kilrea can wait till I'm an old man.

148
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:21,356
Too many scoundrels
to be saved in Belfast anyway.

149
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,192
- Busy work. Aye.
- Sure, God will reward you in heaven.

150
00:48:24,277 --> 00:48:27,696
And I'll be thankful,
once there's wine involved.

151
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:32,325
So what's your wee brother
do back home?

152
00:48:35,204 --> 00:48:37,205
He's a parish priest.

153
00:48:39,542 --> 00:48:42,043
He's a sneaky wee bastard.
You know the sort, Bobby.

154
00:48:42,128 --> 00:48:45,213
- Still goes poachin'?
- Poachin' jobs.

155
00:48:45,298 --> 00:48:47,591
And he's younger than me
by eight years, all right.

156
00:48:47,675 --> 00:48:50,093
Go on.

157
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:55,056
Ah, as a cleric, I work in a parish
beside Kilrea  wee hole of a place.

158
00:48:55,141 --> 00:48:57,100
I'm workin' me arse off.

159
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:59,686
House calls to the elderly,
mobile confessions.

160
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,813
- The glamour stuff.
- Oh, aye.

161
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:05,900
- So, anyway, a position comes up in Kilrea 
- Right.

162
00:49:05,985 --> 00:49:09,112
and I'm passed over for some reason or other 
no reason probably.

163
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:11,698
- Takin' too much cake off the old ladies.
- Probably.

164
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:14,075
So?

165
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:17,704
So, about five years later, position again
comes up back home in Kilrea.

166
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:22,250
And my brother Michael
waltzes right into it.

167
00:49:22,335 --> 00:49:24,044
Fuck.

168
00:49:25,046 --> 00:49:27,839
He's made parish priest at 28.

169
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:29,883
More spiritual probably.
Less lippy than you.

170
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:33,386
He worked the bishop. He's a golfer.

171
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:36,598
He's a pushy little twerp is what he is.

172
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:38,933
- At least you're not bitter.
- Oh, no. I couldn't be that, no.

173
00:49:39,018 --> 00:49:41,478
Parish priest at 28? Fantastic.

174
00:49:41,562 --> 00:49:43,855
Mmm. He has two cars.

175
00:49:45,191 --> 00:49:47,192
And the house he has is massive.

176
00:49:47,276 --> 00:49:49,444
He has a maid, a cook.

177
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:51,529
I'm stuck in a two-up two-down...

178
00:49:51,614 --> 00:49:54,407
with a fat Kerry man who drones on and on
about Gaelic football.

179
00:49:54,492 --> 00:49:56,868
- Can we stop talkin' about this?
- Jesus. You're the one who's talkin'.

180
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:58,870
Mmm.

181
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:03,124
- How's your smoke goin'?
- Grand.

182
00:50:03,209 --> 00:50:06,169
- Mmm. Filthy habit. Disgusting.
- Oh, aye. Awful.

183
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:09,547
- Lovely though.
- Aye. Praise the Lord.

184
00:50:13,052 --> 00:50:15,887
- Twenty-eight. My God.
- Oh, stop it.

185
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:21,976
- So, what happened to your eye, Bobby?
- What?

186
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:25,397
- Did you get a dig for yourself? Your eye.
- Difference of opinion.

187
00:50:25,481 --> 00:50:27,482
Mmm. How's the other fella?

188
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:29,567
Oh, a lot worse. Believe me.

189
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:34,364
- So, what did you call me here for?
- What, is that the idle banter over with?

190
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:36,866
Priest etiquette 
start with the small talk.

191
00:50:36,951 --> 00:50:38,868
I'm learning a lot
about the priesthood, Dom.

192
00:50:38,953 --> 00:50:41,579
- Mmm. You'd make a fine priest.
- Oh, aye.

193
00:50:41,664 --> 00:50:43,581
Good talker. A man of principal.
Leader of men.

194
00:50:43,666 --> 00:50:45,375
Political terrorist.

195
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:48,294
- The church loves a reformed crook.
- Aye.

196
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:54,008
I always felt that thief next to Jesus
got off lightly.

197
00:50:54,093 --> 00:50:56,219
Ah, but he recognized his sins.

198
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:58,263
- Did he though?
- Aye. Said as much.

199
00:50:59,265 --> 00:51:01,599
When you're hung from a cross,
you're gonna say anything.

200
00:51:01,684 --> 00:51:04,561
Jesus offers him a seat next to his daddy
in a place called paradise...

201
00:51:04,645 --> 00:51:07,021
you're always gonna put your hand up
and have a piece of that.

202
00:51:07,106 --> 00:51:09,315
Aye. Even when it's nailed to your cross.

203
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,526
Jesus Christ.

204
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:13,319
- That's sacrilegious.
- Sacrilegious?

205
00:51:13,404 --> 00:51:15,655
- Aye.
- No, no, no. He was a dirty thief.

206
00:51:17,658 --> 00:51:20,618
So, what did you want to tell me?

207
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:23,913
Where are you at?

208
00:51:23,998 --> 00:51:26,541
Been driven mad by that governor yet?

209
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:30,587
See, this negotiating lark 
it's been a sideshow.

210
00:51:30,671 --> 00:51:34,090
- I'll tell you that for nothin'.
- But you understand why you need to do it?

211
00:51:34,175 --> 00:51:36,176
Because we're no longer good propaganda.

212
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:38,178
According to who  the leadership?

213
00:51:40,139 --> 00:51:43,558
Time has come.
A decision had to be made.

214
00:51:45,478 --> 00:51:48,229
You think that's what the leadership think?

215
00:51:48,314 --> 00:51:50,482
- Maybe. I don't know.
- Bit paranoid there, Bobby.

216
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:58,198
- 10,000 people marched for the seven hunger strikers last October, right?
- Right.

217
00:51:58,282 --> 00:52:00,658
- International pressure on the Brits and all that.
- Busy time.

218
00:52:00,743 --> 00:52:03,244
Even the pope's having a say,
getting involved.

219
00:52:03,329 --> 00:52:06,748
The whole world trying to get Maggie Thatcher
to back down, give us our demands.

220
00:52:06,832 --> 00:52:09,584
- But it all came to nothin'.
- Right.

221
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:11,795
Hunger strike failed.

222
00:52:11,879 --> 00:52:13,838
We're on the front line.

223
00:52:13,923 --> 00:52:17,091
We created the protest.
It's our responsibility.

224
00:52:17,176 --> 00:52:19,093
Leadership have been
very clear to me, Dom.

225
00:52:19,178 --> 00:52:21,679
Four and a half years
of the "no wash" protest...

226
00:52:21,764 --> 00:52:24,599
as much as it's highlighted
republicanism to some extent...

227
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:27,101
it's also distracted from the wider
development of the organization.

228
00:52:27,186 --> 00:52:29,145
That's because your needs
are specific needs.

229
00:52:29,230 --> 00:52:31,147
Of course they are.

230
00:52:31,232 --> 00:52:33,691
Some woman bringing up
three children in West Belfast...

231
00:52:33,776 --> 00:52:35,693
shouldn't care about civilian-type clothing...

232
00:52:35,778 --> 00:52:38,446
- or whatever the fuck they're calling these clown outfits.
- I saw them.

233
00:52:38,531 --> 00:52:40,990
Honest to God, Dom,
we were promised our own clothes.

234
00:52:41,075 --> 00:52:42,992
It's childish skulduggery.

235
00:52:43,077 --> 00:52:45,161
So the leadership
have had enough of you?

236
00:52:47,623 --> 00:52:52,794
In the ideal world, we'd be fighting our battles
independently, but we're tied.

237
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:54,879
Nothing's changed in here.
Nothing's moved on.

238
00:52:54,964 --> 00:52:56,881
The leadership are stuck with us...

239
00:52:56,966 --> 00:52:59,217
until there's some realistic chance
of movement towards political status.

240
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:01,219
That's the hard truth of it.

241
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:04,013
See, to get me to negotiate
with these lying, reneging monkeys...

242
00:53:04,098 --> 00:53:06,641
when there's never nothin' on the table,
it's just pure crap.

243
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:08,852
I'm not going to be marched
into this governor's office...

244
00:53:08,936 --> 00:53:12,981
and get caught up in some mindless,
pointless dialogue with that pompous bastard.

245
00:53:13,065 --> 00:53:15,775
- Well, he's a big fan of yours.
- Thick as two short planks, Dom. A moron.

246
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:18,820
Can you believe they made him governor?
It's a bloody insult to humanity.

247
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:21,573
Mother of Jesus,
where do you get your energy from?

248
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:25,702
I was a cross-country runner as a boy.

249
00:53:25,786 --> 00:53:29,163
I could have guessed it.
Big engine on you.

250
00:53:29,248 --> 00:53:31,249
Cross-country running.

251
00:53:32,376 --> 00:53:34,335
Explains a lot about you, Bobby.

252
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:37,881
Why, I loved it. So I did.
That's the whole country thing for me.

253
00:53:37,965 --> 00:53:40,842
Jesus, they'd have to hold me back
at the finishing line, or I'd keep on running.

254
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:44,888
Little scraps.
We were mongrels from out of the city.

255
00:53:44,972 --> 00:53:47,849
Frightened of cattle and all.
It was a funny time.

256
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:50,435
- Frightened of cattle?
- Oh, aye, terrified of them.

257
00:53:50,519 --> 00:53:53,605
Think you could get milk and burgers
from them monsters? Jesus Christ.

258
00:53:57,610 --> 00:54:00,445
The next time round,
I'll be born in countryside, guaranteed.

259
00:54:01,614 --> 00:54:03,573
Wildlife, birds.

260
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:05,992
I love all that  paradise.

261
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:09,954
Aye, and you could learn to relax too.

262
00:54:10,039 --> 00:54:12,707
Aye. Maybe. You never know.

263
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:14,792
Never tried it before.

264
00:54:16,128 --> 00:54:18,463
I'm starting a hunger strike
on the first of March.

265
00:54:20,925 --> 00:54:22,967
That's why you're here.
That's what I'm telling you.

266
00:54:24,053 --> 00:54:25,970
Aye. I heard that.

267
00:54:30,434 --> 00:54:33,061
- Does your family know?
- I got word out to them, aye.

268
00:54:33,145 --> 00:54:35,563
- Have you spoken with them?
- Got a visit in two weeks' time.

269
00:54:35,648 --> 00:54:38,483
- We'll talk then.
- How do you think they'll take it?

270
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:41,611
What do you think, Dom?

271
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:43,655
And your wee boy?

272
00:55:02,383 --> 00:55:05,635
So, what makes it different
from the last time?

273
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:11,766
Last hunger strike was flawed.
It became emotional.

274
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:14,227
Seven men started at the same time.

275
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:16,270
They all got weak,
and they couldn't let the weakest one die...

276
00:55:16,355 --> 00:55:18,773
which left us susceptible
to being conned by the Brits.

277
00:55:18,857 --> 00:55:21,025
And that's exactly what we were  conned.

278
00:55:22,236 --> 00:55:25,113
This time out, the men will start
consecutively, two weeks apart.

279
00:55:25,197 --> 00:55:28,241
Somebody dies, they'll be replaced.
There's no shortage of us.

280
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:31,577
- Seventy-five men have put their names forward.
- Oh, for Christ's sake.

281
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:35,164
The announcement's being made today.

282
00:55:38,961 --> 00:55:42,547
So what makes this protest different
is that you're set to die, Bobby?

283
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:45,967
It may well come to that.

284
00:55:46,051 --> 00:55:48,720
You start a hunger strike
to protest for what you believe in.

285
00:55:48,804 --> 00:55:52,140
You don't start already determined to die.
Or am I missing something here?

286
00:55:53,225 --> 00:55:56,394
It's in their hands. Our message is clear.
They're seeing our determination.

287
00:55:58,063 --> 00:56:01,482
So it'll take a couple of deaths,
do you think? Maybe five or six?

288
00:56:01,567 --> 00:56:03,484
But sure, there's 75 of you.

289
00:56:03,569 --> 00:56:05,737
Aye. Well, it won't come to that.

290
00:56:05,821 --> 00:56:09,323
All right, maybe the Brits will buckle
after 20 or so.

291
00:56:09,408 --> 00:56:12,201
But why should you care,
'cause you're already dead, right?

292
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:26,007
Have you thought about what you're going
to be putting these boys through?

293
00:56:26,091 --> 00:56:29,594
I mean, putting aside what's gonna happen
to these poor men's families.

294
00:56:29,678 --> 00:56:31,679
You're going head-to-head
with a British government...

295
00:56:31,764 --> 00:56:35,683
that clearly despise republicanism,
who are unshakable...

296
00:56:35,768 --> 00:56:39,479
who can easily live with the deaths
of what they call terrorists.

297
00:56:39,563 --> 00:56:42,565
- And the stakes are much higher this time.
- I know that.

298
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:45,526
And if you're not even willing to negotiate,
you're looking for them to capitulate.

299
00:56:45,611 --> 00:56:47,320
- Is that it?
- Right.

300
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:52,033
So failure means many dead men,
families torn apart...

301
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:54,077
and the whole republican movement
demoralized.

302
00:56:54,161 --> 00:56:55,661
Aye.

303
00:56:55,746 --> 00:56:57,663
Worst case scenario,
it might well mean all that.

304
00:56:57,748 --> 00:56:59,665
- But short term  out of the ashes.
- Come on.

305
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:02,001
Guaranteed, there'll be a new generation
of men and women...

306
00:57:02,086 --> 00:57:04,003
even more resilient, more determined.

307
00:57:04,088 --> 00:57:06,297
- Look who you're talking to.
- There's a war going on.

308
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:08,716
I thought you might understand.
You're talking like a foreigner.

309
00:57:08,801 --> 00:57:12,303
You're talking to me like I'm a foreigner. You think
I don't know Northern Ireland? I live here, man.

310
00:57:12,387 --> 00:57:15,264
- Then support us.
- I supported the first hunger strike...

311
00:57:15,349 --> 00:57:18,142
on the basis it was a protest...

312
00:57:18,227 --> 00:57:21,395
not some "predesigned to die
and balk at negotiation...

313
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:23,397
other than complete
surrender from Thatcher."

314
00:57:23,482 --> 00:57:25,399
That's ridiculous, Bobby.
It's destructive.

315
00:57:25,484 --> 00:57:27,902
What-What's happening here
for the last four years?

316
00:57:27,986 --> 00:57:31,197
The brutality, humiliation, our basic
human rights taken away from us.

317
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:33,825
- All of this has to come to an end.
- Through talking.

318
00:57:35,202 --> 00:57:38,412
So, what? We take their offer
and put their uniform on...

319
00:57:38,497 --> 00:57:41,082
'cause the last four years
have meant nothing?

320
00:57:41,166 --> 00:57:44,752
We could do that, Dom, or we could
behave like the army we proclaim to be...

321
00:57:44,837 --> 00:57:46,754
and lay down our lives for our comrades.

322
00:57:46,839 --> 00:57:49,382
Is there not even a small part of you
that's hoping for a breakthrough...

323
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:51,759
that-that could find you negotiating again?

324
00:57:51,844 --> 00:57:54,178
- That won't happen.
- Right, forget about that.

325
00:57:54,263 --> 00:57:57,807
I want to know whether your intent
is just purely to commit suicide here.

326
00:58:02,646 --> 00:58:05,481
You want me to argue about the morality
of what I'm about to do...

327
00:58:05,566 --> 00:58:07,567
and whether it's really suicide or not?

328
00:58:09,403 --> 00:58:12,155
For one, you're calling it suicide.
I call it murder.

329
00:58:12,239 --> 00:58:14,657
And that's just another wee difference
between us two.

330
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:17,243
We're both Catholic men,
both republicans.

331
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:19,287
But while you were poaching salmon
in lovely Kilrea...

332
00:58:19,371 --> 00:58:21,289
we were being burnt out
of our house in Rathcoole.

333
00:58:21,373 --> 00:58:25,168
Similar in many ways, Dom, but life and
experiences focused our beliefs differently.

334
00:58:25,252 --> 00:58:27,253
- You understand me?
- I understand.

335
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:31,048
I have my belief. And, in all its simplicity,
that is a most powerful thing.

336
00:58:33,468 --> 00:58:35,469
So what's your statement by dying?

337
00:58:37,848 --> 00:58:39,765
Just highlighting British intransigence?

338
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:42,310
So fucking what? The whole world
knows what the Brits are like.

339
00:58:42,394 --> 00:58:45,646
- Good.
- Aye, it is good, and it's nothing to do with you.

340
00:58:45,731 --> 00:58:47,982
The Brits have been fucking up
everything for centuries.

341
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:49,984
I can feel your hatred, Dom.

342
00:58:50,068 --> 00:58:52,236
- Oh, you're looking for martyrdom?
- No.

343
00:58:52,321 --> 00:58:54,238
- Are you sure?
- Aye.

344
00:58:54,323 --> 00:58:59,202
'Cause I've heard you eulogizing Wolfe Tone,
Connolly, MacSwiney  all them men.

345
00:58:59,286 --> 00:59:01,871
I can't help thinking you're writing your name
large for all them history books.

346
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:04,540
- 'Cause you think that matters to me?
- Oh, aye, I know it does.

347
00:59:04,625 --> 00:59:06,626
Well, you're wrong.

348
00:59:08,253 --> 00:59:10,713
You say you're soldiers.

349
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:12,757
It's all about the freedom.

350
00:59:13,926 --> 00:59:16,469
But you got no appreciation
of a life, Bobby.

351
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:18,930
You no longer know
what a life is, you men.

352
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:23,351
Four years living in these conditions,
no one expects you to be normal.

353
00:59:23,435 --> 00:59:25,353
There's nothing normal about you.

354
00:59:27,147 --> 00:59:30,274
Right now, the republican movement
has talked itself into a corner.

355
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:35,029
You I.R.A. are standing right behind it
looking into that corner.

356
00:59:35,113 --> 00:59:40,034
All that history, all them dead men and women 
you're still seeing nothing.

357
00:59:40,118 --> 00:59:42,036
When your answer is to kill everything...

358
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:45,581
you've blinded yourself,
and you're scared to stop it.

359
00:59:47,292 --> 00:59:50,544
Afraid of living.
Afraid of talk and peace.

360
00:59:50,629 --> 00:59:53,756
Sure, what would Ulster be
if wasn't tearing itself to shit?

361
00:59:55,634 --> 00:59:59,553
And this situation here, that the future
of the republican movement...

362
00:59:59,638 --> 01:00:04,642
is in the hands of you men who have lost all 
all sense of reality.

363
01:00:05,978 --> 01:00:07,895
You think your head's on right?

364
01:00:09,690 --> 01:00:12,441
Locked up in here 24 hours a day
in piss and shit...

365
01:00:12,526 --> 01:00:15,361
and you are making decisions
that could see so many men die.

366
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:18,072
Build a statue to Bobby Sands.

367
01:00:18,156 --> 01:00:20,741
You're joking me.
Freedom fighter?

368
01:00:22,494 --> 01:00:25,579
They're the men and women
working out there in the community.

369
01:00:25,664 --> 01:00:28,082
And that was you once upon a time.
Am I right?

370
01:00:29,084 --> 01:00:31,043
All that work you did in Twinbrook.

371
01:00:32,045 --> 01:00:35,464
That's where we need you, Bobby.
And you know I'm right.

372
01:00:37,426 --> 01:00:40,344
That I'm deluded 
you want me to answer that?

373
01:00:40,429 --> 01:00:42,471
They're beating you, Bobby.
You're playing into their hands.

374
01:00:42,556 --> 01:00:45,850
- The strategy's in place.
- Then stop it. Just say stop.

375
01:00:45,934 --> 01:00:49,937
- You don't understand a thing.
- You're in no shape to make this call.

376
01:00:50,022 --> 01:00:52,606
It's done. It won't be stopped.

377
01:00:52,691 --> 01:00:55,359
Then fuck it.
Life must mean nothing to you.

378
01:00:57,195 --> 01:00:59,196
God's gonna punish me?

379
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:10,207
Well, if not just for the suicide,
then he'd have to punish you for stupidity.

380
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:16,213
Aye, and you for your arrogance.

381
01:01:17,341 --> 01:01:20,593
'Cause my life is a real life,
not some theological exercise...

382
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:23,721
some religious trick
that's got fuck-all to do with living.

383
01:01:24,765 --> 01:01:28,768
Jesus Christ had a backbone.
But, see, them disciples? Every disciple since 

384
01:01:28,852 --> 01:01:32,855
you're just jumping in and out
of the rhetoric and dead-end semantics.

385
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:34,440
You need the revolutionary...

386
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:37,360
you need the cultural-political soldier
to give life a pulse, to give life a direction.

387
01:01:37,444 --> 01:01:41,197
- That's stupid talk. You're deluded.
- Aye, so you say.

388
01:01:41,281 --> 01:01:43,866
- Yeah, and what's your wee son gonna say?
- Fuck off.

389
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:46,035
Doesn't it interest you?

390
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:49,538
You're gonna attack me with sentiment?
Typical priest.

391
01:01:49,623 --> 01:01:52,208
- What's your heart saying, Bobby?
- I thought you had me all figured out, Dom.

392
01:01:52,292 --> 01:01:54,293
What's it saying? Tell me.

393
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:01,592
My life means everything to me.
Freedom means everything.

394
01:02:03,095 --> 01:02:06,430
I know you don't mean to mock me, Dom,
so I'll just let all that pass.

395
01:02:07,933 --> 01:02:10,726
This is one of these times
when we've come to a pause.

396
01:02:10,811 --> 01:02:13,229
It's a time to keep your beliefs pure.

397
01:02:13,313 --> 01:02:16,440
I believe that a united Ireland
is right and just.

398
01:02:18,110 --> 01:02:21,946
Maybe it's impossible
for a man like you to understand...

399
01:02:22,030 --> 01:02:25,032
but having a respect for my life,
a desire for freedom...

400
01:02:25,117 --> 01:02:28,035
an unyielding love for that belief...

401
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:30,121
means I can see past any doubts I may have.

402
01:02:32,249 --> 01:02:35,709
Putting my life on the line
is not just the only thing I can do, Dom.

403
01:02:35,794 --> 01:02:37,795
It's the right thing.

404
01:02:42,801 --> 01:02:44,802
And this is why you've called me here.

405
01:02:46,096 --> 01:02:49,890
Needed a sounding board?
Not a hundred percent sure of yourself?

406
01:02:49,975 --> 01:02:52,017
Been doubting yourself maybe?

407
01:02:52,102 --> 01:02:55,896
Aye. Well, I'm only human.

408
01:02:55,981 --> 01:02:57,982
And I've made it clear for you then?

409
01:02:59,734 --> 01:03:02,862
Man of guidance, Dom.
Business of the soul.

410
01:03:15,292 --> 01:03:17,543
You been to Gweedore in Donegal?

411
01:03:19,171 --> 01:03:21,088
Aye.

412
01:03:28,513 --> 01:03:30,431
I went there when I was 12.

413
01:03:32,684 --> 01:03:35,186
Big cross-country race for the boys...

414
01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:38,314
and we're all in the back of a minibus
headed towards Derry one morning.

415
01:03:40,525 --> 01:03:42,902
I mean, this is big-time.

416
01:03:42,986 --> 01:03:44,945
You know? This is like
international athletics for us...

417
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:50,367
'cause we're racing against boys in the south,
and we have this thing to do Belfast proud.

418
01:03:52,996 --> 01:03:57,208
Two of the boys are Prods,
and the rest of us are Catholics.

419
01:03:57,292 --> 01:03:59,502
It's a cross-community event.

420
01:03:59,586 --> 01:04:03,005
I suppose the good people in the south
think this is great stuff...

421
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:06,550
and let's get this wee team over from Belfast
and all that patronizing shite.

422
01:04:10,013 --> 01:04:13,933
Anyway, we're through the border.

423
01:04:16,102 --> 01:04:19,188
The boys are all singing pop tunes and all...

424
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:21,982
but I'm just in the back of the bus
looking out the window.

425
01:04:24,528 --> 01:04:26,612
We're going through them mountains...

426
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:28,697
you know, where Mount Errigal is
and everything.

427
01:04:30,659 --> 01:04:32,660
It's a beautiful sight, Dom.

428
01:04:34,037 --> 01:04:36,914
Donegal has to be the most beautiful
place in Ireland, I reckon.

429
01:04:39,042 --> 01:04:40,960
Aye.

430
01:04:47,092 --> 01:04:49,051
Anyway...

431
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:52,721
we arrive at Gweedore.

432
01:04:53,723 --> 01:04:57,142
What a place.
And it's hopping with about 200 boys...

433
01:04:57,227 --> 01:05:00,396
and they're getting into their gear
and limbering up.

434
01:05:01,648 --> 01:05:03,566
The whole event's run by Christian brothers...

435
01:05:03,650 --> 01:05:06,193
and they're clipping young fellas
around the back of the ears...

436
01:05:06,278 --> 01:05:08,362
basically trying to retain some order.

437
01:05:09,948 --> 01:05:12,825
Our team goes off for a wee jog,
stretch out the legs.

438
01:05:15,829 --> 01:05:18,330
We're surrounded by fields of barley.

439
01:05:20,417 --> 01:05:24,128
And they dip down into a wee valley where
there's a stream and woods runnin' through it.

440
01:05:28,174 --> 01:05:33,762
The woods and stream are out-of-bounds, so
naturally us Belfast boys have to go check 'em out.

441
01:05:33,847 --> 01:05:36,473
Woods and a stream, Dom.
Sure, that's like the Amazon to us.

442
01:05:39,227 --> 01:05:42,146
And we come across
these young fellas from Cork.

443
01:05:42,230 --> 01:05:45,899
There's, uh, some banter about our accents,
but they could barely talk.

444
01:05:45,984 --> 01:05:47,985
We couldn't understand a word
they were saying.

445
01:05:49,613 --> 01:05:53,240
You get the idea that they're lording it over us
a bit, you know, looking down on us.

446
01:05:53,325 --> 01:05:55,326
I'm sensing it anyway.

447
01:05:57,037 --> 01:06:00,080
We're running along,
and we come up with this idea...

448
01:06:00,165 --> 01:06:03,000
to go down to the stream
and check it out for fish.

449
01:06:04,669 --> 01:06:07,087
So we're down by the river, Dom  stream.

450
01:06:07,172 --> 01:06:09,840
It was half a foot of water in there.

451
01:06:09,924 --> 01:06:14,803
Little silver fish but none substantial,
until one of their boys calls us further down.

452
01:06:17,349 --> 01:06:22,019
Lying in the water is a wee foal,
four or five days old.

453
01:06:22,103 --> 01:06:25,189
He's all skin and bone, a gray color.

454
01:06:25,273 --> 01:06:27,232
And he's got flecks of blood on his coat...

455
01:06:27,317 --> 01:06:29,902
'cause he cut himself up really badly
on the sharp rocks.

456
01:06:33,531 --> 01:06:36,367
We're just standing over him,
and you can see his back leg snapped.

457
01:06:37,452 --> 01:06:39,870
And he's breathing.
He's alive, but just about.

458
01:06:42,874 --> 01:06:45,459
So this big conversation gets started up...

459
01:06:45,543 --> 01:06:48,962
between the boys who suddenly
reckon themselves the leaders...

460
01:06:49,047 --> 01:06:51,006
and they're deliberating
as what we should do.

461
01:06:51,091 --> 01:06:53,008
Someone says, "Drop a rock on his head."

462
01:06:53,093 --> 01:06:56,970
But I'm looking in their faces, and I can see
they're either scared stiff or clueless.

463
01:06:57,055 --> 01:06:59,640
It's all bravado.

464
01:06:59,724 --> 01:07:03,811
And this foal on the ground,
in real pain.

465
01:07:03,895 --> 01:07:06,563
All this chitchat going on, going nowhere.

466
01:07:08,650 --> 01:07:11,819
Next thing, one of the priests sees us,
sees the foal...

467
01:07:11,903 --> 01:07:13,904
tells us not to move and we're done for.

468
01:07:13,988 --> 01:07:15,698
I mean we're really done for.

469
01:07:15,782 --> 01:07:17,991
Group of boys will always get the blame
for hurtin' a foal.

470
01:07:18,076 --> 01:07:20,327
Group of Belfast boys
will get a hammerin' for sure.

471
01:07:21,371 --> 01:07:24,164
So it's clear to me in an instant,
and I'm down on my knees...

472
01:07:24,249 --> 01:07:26,959
and I take the foal's head in my hands
and I put him underwater.

473
01:07:28,294 --> 01:07:32,089
He's thrashing around a bit to start,
so I press down harder until he's drowned.

474
01:07:35,260 --> 01:07:37,219
Priest arrives, Dom.

475
01:07:38,430 --> 01:07:41,306
He's grabbing me by the hair,
dragging me through the woods...

476
01:07:41,391 --> 01:07:43,600
promising me a proper hiding.

477
01:07:43,685 --> 01:07:47,688
But I knew I did the right thing
by that wee foal.

478
01:07:47,772 --> 01:07:51,358
And I could take the punishment
for all our boys.

479
01:07:51,443 --> 01:07:54,903
I had the respect of them other boys now,
and I knew that.

480
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:04,121
I'm clear of the reasons, Dom.

481
01:08:05,290 --> 01:08:07,541
I'm clear of all the repercussions.

482
01:08:08,752 --> 01:08:12,045
But I will act, and I will not stand by
and do nothin'.

483
01:08:50,418 --> 01:08:52,419
You can leave them there if you like.

484
01:08:53,505 --> 01:08:56,006
Don't want me rolling up
the Letters of Saint John, do you?

485
01:09:02,013 --> 01:09:04,223
Couldn't have that on my conscience, no.

486
01:09:12,690 --> 01:09:15,067
I don't think I'm gonna
see you again, Bobby.

487
01:09:17,028 --> 01:09:19,029
There's no need, Dom.

488
01:12:55,079 --> 01:12:59,916
And faced now
with the failure of their discredited cause...

489
01:13:00,001 --> 01:13:03,670
the men of violence
have chosen in recent months...

490
01:13:03,755 --> 01:13:08,508
to play what may well be
their last card.

491
01:13:08,593 --> 01:13:11,845
They have turned their violence
against themselves...

492
01:13:11,929 --> 01:13:15,307
through the prison "hunger strike to death."

493
01:13:16,309 --> 01:13:20,520
They seek to work on the most basic
of human emotions 

494
01:13:20,605 --> 01:13:22,355
pity 

495
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:25,150
as a means of creating tension...

496
01:13:25,234 --> 01:13:28,487
and stoking the fires
of bitterness and hatred.

497
01:14:00,728 --> 01:14:03,063
And from week one,
there's been a gradual deterioration...

498
01:14:03,147 --> 01:14:05,273
of liver, kidney and pancreatic function.

499
01:14:07,276 --> 01:14:11,655
Also, the bone density decreases substantially
due to calcium and vitamin deficiencies.

500
01:14:14,492 --> 01:14:17,911
The muscle of the heart is also undernourished...

501
01:14:17,995 --> 01:14:21,414
causing impaired function
and, eventually, cardiac failure.

502
01:14:27,922 --> 01:14:31,007
The left ventricle could shrink
to 70% of its normal size.

503
01:14:34,595 --> 01:14:38,473
He will have low blood sugar,
low energy and muscular wasting.

504
01:14:41,686 --> 01:14:43,979
He'll be experiencing gastrointestinal ulcers...

505
01:14:44,063 --> 01:14:47,649
with the thinning of the intestinal wall
and submucosal hemorrhaging.

506
01:14:51,279 --> 01:14:54,406
There will have been degenerative changes
to the mucous membrane of the intestines...

507
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:56,533
and, indeed, all the organs in the body.
