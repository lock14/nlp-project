1
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,657
- Good luck.

2
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:43,639
Hi. Uh, I have an appointment
with Emily Charlton?

3
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:47,226
- Andrea Sachs?
- Yes.

4
00:03:47,311 --> 00:03:50,855
Great. Human Resources certainly
has an odd sense of humor.

5
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,940
Follow me.

6
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:57,153
Okay, so I was Miranda's
second assistant...

7
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:00,406
but her first assistant recently got promoted,
and so now I'm the first.

8
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,783
- Oh, and you're replacing yourself.
- Well, I am trying.

9
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:05,286
Miranda sacked the last two girls
after only a few weeks.

10
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,788
We need to find someone who can survive here.
Do you understand?

11
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:09,832
Yeah. Of course. Who's Miranda?

12
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:13,252
Oh, my God. I will pretend
you did not just ask me that.

13
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:16,172
She's the editor in chief of Runway,
not to mention a legend.

14
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:20,259
You work a year for her, and you can
get a job at any magazine you want.

15
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:22,720
A million girls would kill for this job.

16
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:25,598
It sounds like a great opportunity.
I'd love to be considered.

17
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:31,604
Andrea,
Runway is a fashion magazine...

18
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:34,649
so an interest in fashion is crucial.

19
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:37,151
What makes you think
I'm not interested in fashion?

20
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:41,113
Oh, my God.

21
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:43,115
No! No! No!

22
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,409
What's wrong?

23
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:53,417
She's on her way. Tell everyone!

24
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:55,962
She's not supposed to be here
until 9:00.

25
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:59,048
Her driver just text messaged,
and her facialist ruptured a disk.

26
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:02,343
- God, these people!
- Who's that?

27
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:05,638
That I can't even talk about.

28
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:08,265
All right, everyone! Gird your loins!

29
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:12,061
Did somebody eat an onion bagel?

30
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:15,791
Sorry, Miranda.

31
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:29,555
Move it! Ooh!

32
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,767
I don't understand why it's so difficult
to confirm an appointment.

33
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:35,853
I know. I'm so sorry, Miranda.
I actually did confirm last night.

34
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:38,064
Details of your incompetence
do not interest me.

35
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:42,026
Tell Simone I'm not going to approve that girl
that she sent me for the Brazilian layout.

36
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:45,696
I asked for clean, athletic, smiling.
She sent me dirty, tired and paunchy.

37
00:06:45,781 --> 00:06:47,740
And R.S.V.P. yes
to the Michael Kors party.

38
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:51,869
I want the driver to drop me off at 9:30
and pick me up at 9:45 sharp.

39
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:56,207
- 9:45 sharp.
- Call Natalie at Glorious Foods,
tell her no for the 40th time.

40
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:59,418
No, I don't want dacquoise. I want tortes
filled with warm rhubarb compote.

41
00:06:59,503 --> 00:07:02,797
Then call my ex-husband and remind him the
parent-teacher conference is at Dalton tonight.

42
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:07,384
Then call my husband, ask him to meet me
for dinner at that place I went to with Massimo.

43
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:12,139
Tell Richard I saw the pictures that he sent
for that feature on the female paratroopers...

44
00:07:12,224 --> 00:07:14,058
and they're all so deeply unattractive.

45
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:17,353
Is it impossible to find a lovely,
slender female paratrooper?

46
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:21,190
- No.
- Am I reaching for the stars here? Not really.

47
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:26,153
<i>Also, I need to see all the things that Nigel</i>
<i>has pulled for Gwyneth's second cover try.</i>

48
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:29,115
<i>I wonder if she's lost any</i>
<i>of that weight yet. Who's that?</i>

49
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,534
Nobody. Um, uh—

50
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:35,955
Human Resources sent her up about the new
assistant job, and I was preinterviewing her.

51
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:38,958
But she's hopeless
and totally wrong for it.

52
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:41,961
Clearly I'm going to have to do that myself
because the last two you sent me...

53
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:43,963
<i>were completely inadequate.</i>

54
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:47,508
So send her in. That's all.

55
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,761
Right.

56
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,891
- She wants to see you.
- Oh! She does?

57
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,893
Move!

58
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:04,650
- This is foul. Don't let her see it. Go!
- That's-

59
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:13,450
Who are you?

60
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:16,162
Uh, my name is Andy Sachs.

61
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:19,248
I recently graduated
from Northwestern University.

62
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:22,042
And what are you doing here?

63
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:26,630
Well, I think I could do a good job
as your assistant.

64
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:30,050
<i>And, um-</i>

65
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:34,430
Yeah, I came to New York to be a journalist
and sent letters out everywhere...

66
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,807
and then finally got a call
from Elias-Clarke...

67
00:08:36,892 --> 00:08:39,518
<i>and met with Sherry</i>
<i>up at Human Resources.</i>

68
00:08:39,603 --> 00:08:42,980
Basically, it's this or Auto Universe.

69
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:47,484
- So you don't read Runway?
- Uh, no.

70
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:51,113
<i>And before today,</i>
<i>you had never heard of me.</i>

71
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:53,115
No.

72
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,368
And you have no style
or sense of fashion.

73
00:08:56,453 --> 00:09:01,290
Well, um, I think that depends
on what you're-

74
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:04,793
No, no. That wasn't a question.

75
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:11,258
Um, I was editor in chief
<i>of the Daily Northwestern.</i>

76
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:15,846
I also, um, won a national competition
for college journalists...

77
00:09:15,931 --> 00:09:18,807
<i>with my series on the janitors, union,</i>
<i>which exposed the exploitation-</i>

78
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:21,310
<i>That's all.</i>

79
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:29,568
Yeah. You know, okay.

80
00:09:29,653 --> 00:09:31,612
You're right. I don't fit in here.

81
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:34,865
I am not skinny or glamorous...

82
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:37,159
<i>and I don't know that much</i>
<i>about fashion.</i>

83
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:39,745
<i>But I'm smart.</i>

84
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,914
I learn fast
and I will work very hard.

85
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:44,458
I got the exclusive
on the Cavalli for Gwyneth...

86
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:47,920
but the problem is, with that huge
feathered headdress that she's wearing...

87
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,631
she looks like she's working
the main stage at the Golden Nugget.

88
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:54,468
Thank you for your time.

89
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:57,429
Who is that sad little person?

90
00:09:57,514 --> 00:10:00,516
Are we doing a before-and-after piece
I don't know about?

91
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:08,482
Brown and Law, please?
Thank you.

92
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:13,862
- Andrea.
- Hmm?

93
00:10:16,992 --> 00:10:19,910
<i>Wait. You got a job</i>
<i>at a fashion magazine?</i>

94
00:10:19,995 --> 00:10:21,954
- Mm-hmm.
- What was it, a phone interview?

95
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:25,499
<i>- Wow.</i>
- Ow! Don't be a jerk.

96
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,752
Miranda Priestly is famous
for being unpredictable.

97
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:31,797
<i>Okay, Doug. How is it</i>
<i>that you know who she is and I didn't?</i>

98
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,383
- I'm actually a girl.
- Oh!

99
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:37,720
- That would explain so much.
<i>- Look, seriously.</i>

100
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:40,639
Miranda Priestly is a huge deal.
I bet a million girls would kill for that job.

101
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:43,600
Yeah, great.
The thing is I'm not one of them.

102
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:46,145
<i>Look, you gotta start somewhere, right?</i>

103
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:48,272
I mean,
look at this dump Nate works in.

104
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:51,066
I mean, come on.
Paper napkins? Hello.

105
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:54,820
Yeah. And Lily, she works at that gallery
doing, uh, you know—

106
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:58,115
Oh, I'm sorry. What exactly is it
that you do anyway?

107
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:01,410
Well, lucky for me,
I already have my dream job.

108
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:05,205
You're a corporate research analyst!

109
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:08,083
- Oh, you're right. My job sucks.
- No!

110
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:10,127
- It sucks. I don't— It's boring.
<i>- It's all right. Breathe.</i>

111
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,129
- I'm trying.
<i>- Here. Take a drink.</i>

112
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:15,132
<i>- I will have a drink. I will have a drink.</i>
- Ah, yes.

113
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:18,469
- I'd like to propose a toast.
To jobs that pay the rent.
- To jobs that pay the rent.

114
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:20,637
Jobs that pay the rent.

115
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:24,308
Oh, baby. You should see the way
these girls at Runway dress.

116
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:26,643
I don't have a thing to wear to work.

117
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:29,188
Come on. You're gonna be
answering phones and getting coffee.

118
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:31,398
You need a ball gown for that?

119
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:33,650
I think I might.

120
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:37,112
Well, I happen to think
you look great always.

121
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:40,324
Aww! I think you're full of it.

122
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:45,037
- Hey. Come on. Let's go home.
- Yeah.

123
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:48,248
I can think of something we can do
that doesn't require any clothing.

124
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,292
- Really?
- Mmm.

125
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,718
Hello?

126
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:02,262
Andrea, Miranda decided to kill
the autumn jacket story for September...

127
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:04,515
and she is pulling up
the Sedona shoot from October.

128
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:08,519
You need to come into the office right this
second and pick up her coffee order on the way.

129
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:11,397
- Now?
<i>- Now, get a pen and write this down.</i>

130
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:15,234
I want one no-foam skimmed latte
with an extra shot...

131
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:17,361
and three drip coffees
with room for milk.

132
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:20,447
Searing hot. And I mean hot.

133
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,078
Hello?

134
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:29,581
- Where are you?
- Oh, I'm almost there. Yeah.

135
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,583
Shoot! Oh!

136
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:38,632
Is there some reason
that my coffee isn't here?

137
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:40,676
Has she died or something?

138
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,262
No.  God.

139
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:50,686
Oh. Bloody time.

140
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:54,565
- I hope you know that this
is a very difficult job—
- Mm-hmm.

141
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:56,567
for which you are totally wrong.

142
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:59,236
And if you mess up,
my head is on the chopping block.

143
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,156
Now, hang that up.
Don't just fling it anywhere.

144
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:15,002
<i>Okay. First of all,</i>
<i>you and I answer the phones.</i>

145
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:18,172
The phone must be answered
every single time it rings.

146
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:21,300
Calls roll to voice mail,
and she gets very upset.

147
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:23,677
<i>If I'm not here-Andrea, Andrea—</i>

148
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,929
you are chained to that desk.

149
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:29,224
- Well, what if I need to—
- What? No.

150
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:33,187
One time an assistant left the desk because
she sliced her hand open with a letter opener...

151
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:36,106
<i>and Miranda missed Lagerfeld...</i>

152
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:38,817
just before he boarded
a 17-hour flight to Australia.

153
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:40,903
She now works at TVGuide.

154
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:46,408
- Man the desk at all times. Got it.

155
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:49,953
- Uh—
- Miranda Priestly's office.

156
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:51,997
No, she's not available.

157
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,790
<i>- Who is it?</i>

158
00:13:55,919 --> 00:14:00,047
Yes, I will tell her
you called... yet again.

159
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:03,675
<i>Right. Remember, you and I</i>
<i>have totally different jobs.</i>

160
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,595
I mean, you get coffee-
and you run errands.

161
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:09,181
Yet I am in charge of her schedule...

162
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,433
<i>her appointments and her expenses.</i>

163
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:13,477
And, um, most importantly, um...

164
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:16,939
I get to go with her to Paris
for Fashion Week in the fall.

165
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:20,192
I get to wear couture.
I go to all the shows and all the parties.

166
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:23,237
I meet all of the designers.
It's divine.

167
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:27,449
Okay. Now, stay here. I'm going to
the art department to give them the Book.

168
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:31,995
- The-
- This is the Book.

169
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,873
Now, it is a mock-up of everything...

170
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:36,959
in the current issue.

171
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:39,878
And we deliver it to Miranda's apartment
every night, and she retu—

172
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:42,923
Don't touch it. She returns it to us
in the morning with her notes.

173
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:46,260
Now, the second assistant
is supposed to do this...

174
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:50,222
but Miranda is very private
and she does not like strangers in her house.

175
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:53,308
So until she decides
that you are not a total psycho...

176
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:55,769
I get the lovely task
of waiting around for the Book.

177
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:59,523
Oh, Emily? What do I do—

178
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:01,942
<i>- Deal with it.</i>

179
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:09,199
Hello. Mrs. Priestly's office.

180
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:12,327
Hmm. That's what I meant.
Miranda Priestly's office.

181
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:18,709
Um, you know, she is in a meeting.
Can I please take a message?

182
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:21,336
Uh-huh.

183
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:24,756
Okay. Can you please spell Gabbana?

184
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:28,260
Hello?

185
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,345
I guess not.

186
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:33,056
I guessed an eight and a half.

187
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:35,726
Um, uh, that's very nice of you...

188
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:38,604
<i>but I don't think I need these.</i>

189
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:41,189
Miranda hired me.
She knows what I look like.

190
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:43,609
Do you?

191
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:47,904
Emily.

192
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:51,450
Emily?

193
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:53,535
She means you.

194
00:15:56,623 --> 00:16:00,250
<i>- We just cut on the bias.</i>
<i>- That's not what I asked you.</i>

195
00:16:00,335 --> 00:16:02,294
I couldn't have been clearer.
There you are, Emily.

196
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:05,380
- How many times do I have to scream your name?
- Actually, it's Andy.

197
00:16:07,342 --> 00:16:11,887
My name is Andy.
Andrea, but, uh, everybody calls me Andy.

198
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:18,310
I need 10 or 15 skirts from Calvin Klein.

199
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:22,481
- What kind of skirts do you—
- Please bore someone else with your questions.

200
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:26,193
<i>And make sure we have Pier59</i>
<i>at 8:00 a.m. tomorrow.</i>

201
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:30,113
Remind Jocelyn I need to see a few of those
satchels that Marc is doing in the pony.

202
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:33,575
<i>And then tell Simone I'll take Jackie</i>
<i>if Maggie isn't available.</i>

203
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:37,412
- Did Demarchelier confirm?
- D-Did D-Demarchel—

204
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:40,499
Demarchelier.
Did he- Get him on the phone.

205
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:43,085
Uh, o— okay.

206
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:47,464
- And, Emily?
- Yes?

207
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,102
That's all.

208
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:04,272
<i>It's just the cavalier disregard</i>
<i>for clear directions-</i>

209
00:17:11,114 --> 00:17:13,448
Do you have Demarchelier?

210
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:15,450
Uh, Demarchelier.

211
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:19,121
- Leave it.
- Do you have-

212
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:23,208
I have Miranda Priestly calling.

213
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:25,252
I have Patrick!

214
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:30,716
Uh, no, she called me in there
and-and then she asked me about Pier 59.

215
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,636
And there was something
about Simone, Frankie, someone else.

216
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:37,931
<i>And, um, she needs skirts</i>
<i>from Calvin Klein.</i>

217
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:41,643
<i>And, uh, there was something</i>
<i>about a pony.</i>

218
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:43,562
- Did she say which skirts?
<i>- No. No.</i>

219
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:46,523
- Did she say what kind? Color, shape, fabric?
- I tried to ask her.

220
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:48,984
You may never ask Miranda anything.

221
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:53,196
Right. I will deal with all of this,
and you will go to Calvin Klein.

222
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:55,782
Eh— Me?

223
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:58,452
Oh, I'm sorry. Do you have
some prior commitment?

224
00:17:58,536 --> 00:18:00,996
Some hideous skirt convention
you have to go to?

225
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,998
Uh—

226
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:17,262
Miranda?

227
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:20,307
- Are you there?
- I'm about to walk in. I'll call you as soon as-

228
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:27,355
- Hello? Hi.
- While you're out...

229
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,109
Miranda needs you to go to Hermès
to pick up 25 scarves we ordered for her.

230
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:33,737
- Okay.
- Cassidy forgot her homework at Dalton.
Pick that up.

231
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:37,115
Miranda went out to meet with Meisel, and
she will want more Starbucks when she gets back.

232
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,701
- Hot Starbucks.
- Can you just repeat that first—

233
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:42,370
Hello?

234
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:48,210
Oh, my God.

235
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:50,629
What took you so long?
I have to pee!

236
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:52,672
What?
You haven't peed since I left?

237
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:56,259
No, I haven't. I've been manning
the desk, haven't I? I'm bursting.

238
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:02,641
Oh, hi.

239
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:05,811
You do coat. Do the coat!

240
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:08,104
Okay.

241
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:10,690
Now, be prepared.
The run-through is at 12:30.

242
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:14,152
<i>People are panicking, so the phone</i>
<i>is going to be ringing off the hook.</i>

243
00:19:14,237 --> 00:19:15,946
The ru— The run-through. Right.

244
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:20,283
Yes. Editors bring in options for the shoot,
and Miranda chooses.

245
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:22,828
She chooses every single thing
in every single issue.

246
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:25,497
Run-throughs are a huge deal.
I don't know why you don't know that, Andrea.

247
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:28,250
<i>- Okay. Are you ready?</i>
- Oh, hi, hi.

248
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:31,336
Right. Well, after the loo,
Serena and I are going to lunch.

249
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,505
<i>- This is her- the new me.</i>
- Hi.

250
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,715
- Told you.
- I thought you were kidding.

251
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,885
<i>No, quite serious, yeah.</i>
<i>I get 20 minutes for lunch, and you get 15.</i>

252
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:41,471
- When I come back, you can go.
- Okay.

253
00:19:41,556 --> 00:19:43,807
<i>What exactly is she wearing?</i>

254
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,642
Her grandmother's skirt.

255
00:19:56,988 --> 00:19:59,114
Hmm. Corn chowder.

256
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,533
<i>That's an interesting choice.</i>

257
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:06,663
You do know that cellulite is one
of the main ingredients in corn chowder.

258
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:13,295
So none of the girls here eat anything?

259
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:18,008
Not since two became the new four
and zero became the new two.

260
00:20:18,092 --> 00:20:22,679
- Well, I'm a six.
- Which is the new 14.

261
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:26,850
Oh. Shoot.

262
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:30,896
Oh, never mind. I'm sure you have plenty
more polyblend where that came from.

263
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:35,525
Okay. You think my clothes are hideous.

264
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:37,527
I get it.

265
00:20:37,612 --> 00:20:40,071
But, you know, I'm not going
to be in fashion forever...

266
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:43,658
so I don't see the point of changing everything
about myself just because I have this job.

267
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:45,660
Yes, that's true.

268
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:49,581
That's really what this multibillion-dollar
industry is all about anyway, isn't it?

269
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:53,793
- Inner beauty.

270
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:56,087
Hello.

271
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:58,173
Right. Come on.

272
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,926
- Miranda's pushed the run-through
up a half an hour.
- Mmm!

273
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:03,386
- She's always 15 minutes early.
- Which means?

274
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:05,764
- You're already late. Come.
- Shoot!

275
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:08,350
Excuse me.

276
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:10,644
Mr. Ravitz.

277
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:12,896
Nigel.

278
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:16,066
- Issue going well?
- Oh, yes. Our best September ever.

279
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:20,737
Great. Heard Miranda killed autumn jackets
and pulled up the Sedona shoot.

280
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:23,698
What's that costing me?

281
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:25,951
About 300,000.

282
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:29,245
Must have been some lousy jackets.

283
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:31,748
- Irv Ravitz.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

284
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:34,042
This is Andy Sachs,
Miranda's new assistant.

285
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,127
Congratulations, young lady.

286
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:39,464
A million girls would kill for that job.

287
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:41,466
Bye-bye.

288
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:44,803
- Hmm?
- Chairman of Elias-Clarke, Irv Ravitz.

289
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:49,641
You know what they say?
Tiny man, huge ego.

290
00:21:52,395 --> 00:21:55,188
No. And I've seen all this before.

291
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:58,191
Theyskens is trying to reinvent
the drop waist, so actually it's—

292
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:01,361
- Where are all the other dresses?
<i>- We have some right here.</i>

293
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:04,698
- Stand, watch and listen.
- And I think it can be very interesting—

294
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:09,160
No. No, I just—
It's just baffling to me.

295
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:12,747
Why is it so impossible
to put together a decent run-through?

296
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:17,711
<i>You people have had hours and hours</i>
<i>to prepare. It's just so confusing to me.</i>

297
00:22:17,795 --> 00:22:19,838
Where are the advertisers?

298
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:23,091
- We have some pieces from Banana Republic.
- We need more, don't we?

299
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:27,095
- Oh. This is— This might be—
What do you think of-
- Yeah.

300
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,763
<i>Well, you know me.</i>

301
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:31,725
Give me a full ballerina skirt
and a hint of saloon and I'm on board.

302
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:35,270
- But do you think it's too much like—
<i>- Like the Lacroix from July?</i>

303
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:38,314
I thought that, but no, not with
the right accessories. It should work.

304
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:42,944
Where are the belts for this dre—
Why is no one ready?

305
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:46,364
Here. It's a tough call.

306
00:22:46,449 --> 00:22:48,616
- They're so different.
<i>- Hmm.</i>

307
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:55,623
Something funny?

308
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:02,172
No. No, no. Nothing's-

309
00:23:02,256 --> 00:23:06,134
You know, it's just that both those belts
look exactly the same to me.

310
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:10,388
You know, I'm still learning
about this stuff and, uh—

311
00:23:10,473 --> 00:23:13,266
"This... stuff"?

312
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:16,936
<i>Oh. Okay. I see.</i>

313
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:19,230
You think this has nothing
to do with you.

314
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:22,692
<i>You go to your closet...</i>

315
00:23:22,777 --> 00:23:27,447
and you select— I don't know—
that lumpy blue sweater, for instance...

316
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:30,408
<i>because you're trying to tell the world</i>
<i>that you take yourself too seriously...</i>

317
00:23:30,493 --> 00:23:32,911
to care about what
you put on your back.

318
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:36,122
But what you don't know
is that that sweater is not just blue.

319
00:23:36,207 --> 00:23:38,750
It's not turquoise. It's not lapis.

320
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:41,044
It's actually cerulean.

321
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:43,213
And you're also blithely unaware
of the fact...

322
00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:47,592
<i>that in 2002, Oscar de la Renta</i>
<i>did a collection of cerulean gowns.</i>

323
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:50,261
<i>And then I think it was</i>
<i>Yves Saint Laurent- wasn't it—</i>

324
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:52,305
who showed cerulean military jackets?

325
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:54,808
- I think we need a jacket here.
- Mmm.

326
00:23:54,892 --> 00:23:58,728
<i>And then cerulean quickly showed up</i>
<i>in the collections of eight different designers.</i>

327
00:23:58,813 --> 00:24:02,065
<i>And then it, uh, filtered down</i>
<i>through the department stores...</i>

328
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:06,236
and then trickled on down
into some tragic Casual Corner...

329
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,447
<i>where you, no doubt,</i>
<i>fished it out of some clearance bin.</i>

330
00:24:09,532 --> 00:24:12,242
<i>However, that blue represents</i>
<i>millions of dollars...</i>

331
00:24:12,326 --> 00:24:14,786
and countless jobs...

332
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:17,956
and it's sort of comical how you think
that you've made a choice...

333
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,999
that exempts you
from the fashion industry...

334
00:24:20,084 --> 00:24:22,001
when, in fact...

335
00:24:22,086 --> 00:24:26,506
you're wearing a sweater that was selected
for you by the people in this room...

336
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:29,384
from a pile of stuff.

337
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:32,095
<i>So then I said,</i>
<i>"No, I couldn't see the difference...</i>

338
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:34,472
<i>between the two</i>
<i>absolutely identical belts"...</i>

339
00:24:34,557 --> 00:24:36,558
and you should have seen
the look she gave me!

340
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:38,726
I thought the flesh
was gonna melt off her face.

341
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:41,396
<i>It's not funny.</i>

342
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:45,692
She's not happy unless everyone around her
is panicked, nauseous or suicidal.

343
00:24:45,776 --> 00:24:48,736
And the Clackers just worship her.

344
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:50,738
- The who?
<i>- They call them Clackers.</i>

345
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:54,159
The sound that their stilettos make
in the marble lobby.

346
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:56,202
It's like,
"Clack, clack, clack, clack, clack."

347
00:24:56,287 --> 00:25:00,039
<i>And they all act like</i>
<i>they're curing cancer or something.</i>

348
00:25:00,124 --> 00:25:03,710
The amount of time and energy...

349
00:25:03,794 --> 00:25:08,214
<i>that these people spend on these insignificant,</i>
<i>minute details, and for what?</i>

350
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:11,926
So that tomorrow they can spend
another $300,000 reshooting something...

351
00:25:12,011 --> 00:25:14,012
<i>that was probably fine to begin with...</i>

352
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:16,931
to sell people things they don't need!

353
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:20,101
God!

354
00:25:20,186 --> 00:25:23,438
- I'm not even hungry anymore.
<i>- What?</i>

355
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:26,441
- That is why those girls are so skinny.
<i>- Oh. No, no, no.</i>

356
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:29,027
Give me that. There's, like,
eight dollars of Jarlsberg in there.

357
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:32,197
You know what?

358
00:25:33,824 --> 00:25:36,367
I just have to stick it out for a year.
One year.

359
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:39,120
And then I can do
what I came to New York to do.

360
00:25:39,205 --> 00:25:42,498
But I can't let Miranda get to me.
I won't.

361
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:44,584
Easy there, tiger.

362
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:48,922
- Oh, good morning, Miranda.
- Get me Isaac.

363
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:53,885
<i>I don't see my breakfast here.</i>
<i>Are my eggs here? Where are my eggs?</i>

364
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:55,678
Excuse me!

365
00:25:55,763 --> 00:25:58,806
<i>Pick up the Polaroids</i>
<i>from the lingerie shoot.</i>

366
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:02,435
<i>Have the brakes checked on my car.</i>

367
00:26:04,939 --> 00:26:08,149
Where's that piece of paper
I had in my hand yesterday morning?

368
00:26:08,234 --> 00:26:13,196
<i>The girls need new surfboards or</i>
<i>boogie boards or something for spring break.</i>

369
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,532
- Hello.
- The twins also need flip-flops.

370
00:26:17,785 --> 00:26:19,535
- Ow!
- Oh, my gosh!

371
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:23,665
<i>Pick up my shoes from Blahnik,</i>
<i>and then go get Patricia.</i>

372
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:26,584
- Who's that?
- Good girl! Good girl! Good girl!

373
00:26:26,669 --> 00:26:30,421
Get me that little table
that I liked at that store on Madison.

374
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:33,675
<i>Get us a reservation for dinner tonight</i>
<i>at that place that got the good review.</i>

375
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:36,427
<i>- Get me Isaac.</i>
<i>- Thirty-six thank-you notes delivered today.</i>

376
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:38,554
<i>- Where is everyone?</i>
<i>- Why is no one working?</i>

377
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,810
Get me Demarchelier.

378
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:52,652
I have Miranda Priestly calling for-
Okay.

379
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:56,614
I have Patrick.

380
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:04,122
Thank God it's Friday, right?

381
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:08,835
<i>At least Miranda will be in Miami,</i>
<i>so we don't have to be on call this weekend.</i>

382
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:10,920
You know,
my dad's coming in from Ohio.

383
00:27:11,005 --> 00:27:13,631
<i>Yeah, we're gonna go out to dinner,</i>
maybe see Chicago.

384
00:27:13,716 --> 00:27:15,800
You doing anything fun this weekend?

385
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:18,261
Yes.

386
00:27:21,515 --> 00:27:24,225
<i>Yeah, Nate said it was great.</i>

387
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:28,187
He actually- He applied here, but they
wanted someone with more experience.

388
00:27:28,272 --> 00:27:30,189
- Here.
- Huh? What's this?

389
00:27:30,274 --> 00:27:33,109
I don't want you
to get behind on your rent.

390
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:36,070
- Dad, how did you—
- It's—

391
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:39,032
I'm gonna kill Mom.

392
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:41,117
Dad, thank you.

393
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:42,910
Mm-hmm.

394
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:49,292
- It's really good to see you.
- You too, honey.

395
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:52,337
So, you want to
start grilling me now...

396
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:54,630
or should we wait till after dinner?

397
00:27:54,715 --> 00:27:57,967
I thought I'd let you at least enjoy
the bread basket first.

398
00:27:58,052 --> 00:27:59,844
No, no, no. It's okay.
Go right ahead.

399
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:02,388
We're just a little worried, honey.

400
00:28:02,473 --> 00:28:05,141
We get e-mails from you
at your office at 2:00 a.m.

401
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:07,977
Your pay is terrible.
You don't get to write anything.

402
00:28:08,062 --> 00:28:10,063
Hey, that's not fair.

403
00:28:10,147 --> 00:28:12,523
I wrote those e-mails.

404
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:15,902
I'm just trying to understand why someone
who got accepted to Stanford Law...

405
00:28:15,986 --> 00:28:19,822
turns it down to be a journalist,
and now you're not even doing that.

406
00:28:19,907 --> 00:28:23,034
Dad, you have to trust me.

407
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:25,912
Being Miranda's assistant
opens a lot of doors.

408
00:28:25,996 --> 00:28:29,582
Emily is going to Paris
with Miranda in a few months...

409
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:33,503
and she's gonna meet editors and writers
from every important magazine.

410
00:28:33,587 --> 00:28:35,546
And in a year, that could be me.

411
00:28:35,631 --> 00:28:38,132
- All right?
- Mm-hmm.

412
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:40,927
Dad, I swear, this is my break.

413
00:28:41,011 --> 00:28:43,471
- This is my- my chance.

414
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:46,682
This is my boss.

415
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:50,895
- I'm sorry, Dad. I have to take this.
- Take it. Take it.

416
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:55,149
- Hello. Miranda?
- My flight has been canceled.

417
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:57,443
It's some absurd weather problem.

418
00:28:57,528 --> 00:29:01,447
I need to get home tonight. The twins have
a recital tomorrow morning at school.

419
00:29:01,532 --> 00:29:03,449
- What?
- At school!

420
00:29:03,534 --> 00:29:05,827
- Absolutely. Let me see what I can do.
- Good.

421
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:08,871
Hi. Um, I know this
is totally last minute...

422
00:29:08,956 --> 00:29:11,874
but I was hoping that you
could maybe get a flight for my boss...

423
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:13,918
from Miami to New York tonight?

424
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:15,920
Uh—

425
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:18,297
<i>- It's right here. Thank you.</i>
<i>- Yeah, any kind of jet.</i>

426
00:29:18,382 --> 00:29:20,299
- From Miami to New York.
- Thank you.

427
00:29:20,384 --> 00:29:22,301
- Yup, I need it tonight. I need it—
- Ow!

428
00:29:22,386 --> 00:29:24,345
- I thought you were going out the other-
- Sweetie! No.

429
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,347
- It's over here, honey.
- Tonight.

430
00:29:26,432 --> 00:29:31,269
<i>Hi. I'm trying to get a flight tonight—</i>
<i>for tonight— from Miami to New York.</i>

431
00:29:31,353 --> 00:29:34,689
Yes, I know there's a hurricane.

432
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:37,442
Nothing is flying out?
What do you mean, nothing is flying out?

433
00:29:37,526 --> 00:29:41,028
It's for Miranda Priestly,
and I know that she's a client of yours.

434
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:45,366
Yes. Yes, hi. I need a jet tonight
from Miami to New York.

435
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:49,287
Yeah. Sorry. Hold on.
Hello? Miranda, hi.

436
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:52,957
I'm trying to get you a flight, but no one
is flying out because of the weather.

437
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:56,043
Please. It's just—
I don't know— drizzling.

438
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:58,754
Someone must be getting out.

439
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:00,756
Call Donatella. Get her jet.

440
00:30:00,841 --> 00:30:03,301
Call everybody else
that we know that has a jet. Irv?

441
00:30:03,385 --> 00:30:06,053
<i>Call every- This is your responsibi—</i>
<i>This is your job.</i>

442
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:08,097
Get me home.

443
00:30:08,182 --> 00:30:10,892
Oh, my God!
She's going to murder me.

444
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:14,645
What does she want you to do, call the National
Guard and have her airlifted out of there?

445
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,772
Of course not. Could I do that?

446
00:30:16,857 --> 00:30:20,109
Come on.

447
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:23,571
The girls, recital
was absolutely wonderful.

448
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,865
They played Rachmaninoff.
Everyone loved it.

449
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:28,159
Everyone except me...

450
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:32,371
because, sadly, I was not there.

451
00:30:32,456 --> 00:30:34,832
Miranda, I'm so sorry.

452
00:30:34,917 --> 00:30:36,876
Do you know why I hired you?

453
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,087
I always hire the same girl—

454
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:43,633
stylish, slender, of course...

455
00:30:43,717 --> 00:30:45,635
<i>worships the magazine.</i>

456
00:30:45,719 --> 00:30:48,804
<i>But so often, they turn out to be-</i>

457
00:30:48,889 --> 00:30:52,308
I don't know— disappointing and, um...

458
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:54,310
stupid.

459
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:59,398
<i>So you, with that impressive résumé...</i>

460
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:02,610
and the big speech
about your so-called work ethic—

461
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:05,613
I, um— I thought you
would be different.

462
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:08,324
<i>I said to myself, go ahead.</i>

463
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:10,993
Take a chance.

464
00:31:11,078 --> 00:31:14,372
Hire the smart, fat girl.

465
00:31:14,456 --> 00:31:17,416
<i>I had hope.</i>

466
00:31:18,627 --> 00:31:20,628
<i>My God. I live on it.</i>

467
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:24,966
Anyway, you ended up
disappointing me more than, um—

468
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:28,970
more than any of the other silly girls.

469
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:35,518
Um, I really did everything
I could think of.

470
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:37,979
<i>- Uh-</i>
- That's all.

471
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:49,949
Excuse me!
Where do you think you're going?

472
00:32:09,011 --> 00:32:12,305
She hates me, Nigel.

473
00:32:12,389 --> 00:32:14,473
And that's my problem because—

474
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:16,601
Oh, wait. No, it's not my problem.

475
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:21,063
I don't know what else I can do because
if I do something right, it's unacknowledged.

476
00:32:21,148 --> 00:32:23,107
She doesn't even say thank you.

477
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:27,528
But if I do something wrong,
she is vicious.

478
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:32,283
- So quit.
- What?

479
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:34,327
- Quit.
- Quit?

480
00:32:34,411 --> 00:32:38,956
I can get another girl to take your job
in five minutes- one who really wants it.

481
00:32:39,041 --> 00:32:41,626
No, I don't want to quit.
That's not fair.

482
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:46,005
But, you know, I'm just saying
that I would just like a little credit...

483
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:48,591
for the fact
that I'm killing myself trying.

484
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:51,135
Andy, be serious.

485
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:53,638
You are not trying.

486
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:56,515
- You are whining.
- I—

487
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,310
What is it that you want me
to say to you, huh?

488
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:04,398
Do you want me to say, "Poor you.
Miranda's picking on you. Poor you. Poor Andy"?

489
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:06,817
Hmm? Wake up, six.

490
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:09,445
<i>She's just doing her job.</i>

491
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:11,864
Don't you know that you
are working at the place...

492
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:14,408
that published some
of the greatest artists of the century?

493
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:17,995
<i>Halston, Lagerfeld, de la Renta.</i>

494
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,415
And what they did, what they created...

495
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:25,294
was greater than art
because you live your life in it.

496
00:33:26,588 --> 00:33:30,925
Well, not you, obviously,
but some people.

497
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:33,678
You think
this is just a magazine, hmm?

498
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:35,721
This is not just a magazine.

499
00:33:35,806 --> 00:33:40,267
This is a shining beacon of hope for-

500
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,353
oh, I don't know—

501
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:45,398
let's say a young boy growing up
in Rhode Island with six brothers...

502
00:33:45,482 --> 00:33:48,651
pretending to go to soccer practice
when he was really going to sewing class...

503
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:52,071
and reading Runway under the covers
at night with a flashlight.

504
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:54,657
You have no idea how many legends
have walked these halls.

505
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:56,951
And what's worse, you don't care.

506
00:33:57,035 --> 00:34:00,955
<i>Because this place, where so many</i>
<i>people would die to work...</i>

507
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:04,166
you only deign to work.

508
00:34:04,251 --> 00:34:07,712
And you want to know why
she doesn't kiss you on the forehead...

509
00:34:07,796 --> 00:34:12,299
and give you a gold star on your homework
at the end of the day.

510
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:15,302
Wake up, sweetheart.

511
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:25,312
- Okay. So I'm screwing it up.
- Mmm.

512
00:34:25,397 --> 00:34:27,690
<i>I don't want to.</i>

513
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:30,484
I just wish that I knew
what I could do to—

514
00:34:35,741 --> 00:34:38,159
- Nigel?
- Hmm?

515
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:40,161
Nigel, Nigel.

516
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:43,706
No.

517
00:34:43,832 --> 00:34:46,917
I don't know what you expect me to do.

518
00:34:47,002 --> 00:34:50,671
<i>There's nothing in this whole closet</i>
<i>that'll fit a size six.</i>

519
00:34:50,756 --> 00:34:53,299
<i>I can guarantee you.</i>

520
00:34:53,383 --> 00:34:56,886
These are all sample sizes-
two and four.

521
00:34:56,970 --> 00:35:01,140
- All right. We're doing this for you. And—
- A poncho?

522
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:03,809
You'll take what I give you
and you'll like it.

523
00:35:03,894 --> 00:35:06,979
- We're doing this Dolce for you.
- Hmm!

524
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:09,482
And shoes.

525
00:35:09,566 --> 00:35:13,027
-Jimmy Choo's.
- Hmm.

526
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:16,197
- Manolo Blahnik.
- Wow.

527
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:18,866
Nancy Gonzalez. Love that.

528
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,327
Okay, Narciso Rodriguez.
This we love.

529
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:25,164
- Uh, it might fit. It might.
- What?

530
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:28,918
Okay. Now, Chanel. You're in desperate
need of Chanel. Darling, shall we?

531
00:35:29,002 --> 00:35:33,172
We have to get to the beauty department,
and God knows how long that's going to take.

532
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:38,010
I mean, I have no idea
why Miranda hired her.

533
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:40,930
Me neither. The other day,
we were in the beauty department.

534
00:35:41,014 --> 00:35:44,558
She held up the Shu Uemura eyelash curler
and said, "What is this?"

535
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:49,563
I just knew
from the moment I saw her...

536
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:52,525
she was going to be
a complete and utter disas-

537
00:36:01,785 --> 00:36:04,912
Miranda Priestly's office.

538
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:08,415
<i>No, actually, she's not available,</i>
<i>but I'll leave word.</i>

539
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:12,294
Okay, thanks. Bye.

540
00:36:12,379 --> 00:36:14,380
How did—

541
00:36:15,924 --> 00:36:17,925
- Are you wearing the-
<i>- The Chanel boots?</i>

542
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:20,636
Yeah, I am.

543
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,721
You look good.

544
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,600
- Oh, God.
- What?

545
00:36:28,645 --> 00:36:31,230
- She does.
- Oh, shut up, Serena.

546
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,527
- See you guys tomorrow.
- Good night, man. Take it easy.

547
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:38,779
Take care of that finger, huh?

548
00:36:56,089 --> 00:37:00,092
So, what do you think?

549
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:04,013
Uh, I think we better get out of here...

550
00:37:04,097 --> 00:37:07,558
before my girlfriend sees me.

551
00:37:53,021 --> 00:37:56,690
♪♪ The gowns are fabulous.

552
00:37:56,775 --> 00:38:00,194
Mm-hmm.
We're gonna use the burgundy.

553
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:11,038
- Gotta find—

554
00:38:11,164 --> 00:38:14,583
So we spent a whole semester
on potatoes alone.

555
00:38:14,668 --> 00:38:16,502
You take the fry and squeeze it.

556
00:38:16,586 --> 00:38:19,546
<i>- See how firm that is?</i>
- Hey. Oh, I'm so sorry I'm late.

557
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:23,133
There was a crisis
in the accessories department.

558
00:38:23,218 --> 00:38:26,261
- I needed to find a python headband.
- Python's hot right now.

559
00:38:26,346 --> 00:38:30,057
<i>I have exciting presents for all of you.</i>

560
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:32,851
<i>Are you ready?</i>

561
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:36,522
- What is that?
- It's a Bang & Olufsen phone.

562
00:38:36,606 --> 00:38:39,358
<i>Charlie Rose sent it to Miranda</i>
<i>for her birthday.</i>

563
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:42,611
I looked it up on line.
It's $1,100.

564
00:38:42,696 --> 00:38:44,405
- What?
- Wow!

565
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:47,783
And I have some products.
Mason Pearson hairbrushes.

566
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:50,285
- A little Clinique.
- Ooh!

567
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:53,831
- Oh, damn it. I love your job.
<i>- Oh! One more.</i>

568
00:38:53,915 --> 00:38:57,001
A little thing.

569
00:38:57,085 --> 00:39:00,004
- Do you want it? You want— Oh.
- Gimme! Gimme, gimme, gimme!

570
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:03,007
- I think she likes it.
- Oh, my God! This is the new Marc Jacobs!

571
00:39:03,091 --> 00:39:05,592
This is sold out everywhere.
Where did you get this?

572
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:08,095
Miranda didn't want it, so—

573
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:12,182
No, no, no, no, no. This bag is, like, $1,900.
I cannot take this from you.

574
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:14,727
Yeah, you can.

575
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:17,646
- Why do women need so many bags?
- Shut up.

576
00:39:17,731 --> 00:39:20,941
You have one. You put all your junk in it,
and that's it. You're done.

577
00:39:21,026 --> 00:39:23,027
Fashion is not about utility.

578
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:25,821
An accessory is merely
a piece of iconography...

579
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:27,781
used to express individual identity.

580
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:31,285
- Oh! And it's pretty.
- That too.

581
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:35,039
Yeah. But the thing is, it turns out there is
more to Runway than just fancy purses.

582
00:39:35,123 --> 00:39:39,126
<i>Look, here's an essay by Jay McInerney,</i>
<i>a piece by Joan Didion.</i>

583
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:42,379
<i>Even an interview</i>
<i>with Christiane Amanpour.</i>

584
00:39:42,464 --> 00:39:45,799
- Looks like someone's been drinking the Kool-Aid.
- What do you—

585
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:49,344
I got it. It's- Yup, the Dragon Lady.

586
00:39:49,429 --> 00:39:51,346
<i>- Oh, Miranda?</i>
- Let me talk to her.

587
00:39:51,431 --> 00:39:53,432
- I need that.
- I'll tell her to get her own scrambled eggs.

588
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:57,269
Lily, no, no, no! Put that thing up!
I was gonna answer it!

589
00:39:57,353 --> 00:40:00,272
It's gonna make-
Give me the... phone.

590
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:05,360
<i>Hi, Miranda.</i>

591
00:40:05,445 --> 00:40:08,489

- Absolutely.

592
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:11,700
- Shh!
- Uh-huh. I'm leaving right now.

593
00:40:11,785 --> 00:40:16,830
You know, you guys
didn't have to be such assholes.

594
00:40:47,904 --> 00:40:50,197
Um, excuse me.

595
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:52,825
I'm looking for James Holt.

596
00:40:52,909 --> 00:40:55,452
Um, that's him right there.

597
00:40:55,537 --> 00:40:58,163
- Oh. Thanks.
- No problem.

598
00:40:58,248 --> 00:41:00,958
- I put my stuff out there, and I pray they improve.
- Really?

599
00:41:01,042 --> 00:41:03,293
- Excuse me.
- Hi.

600
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:06,004
I'm Andy.
I'm picking up for Miranda Priestly.

601
00:41:06,089 --> 00:41:08,757
Oh, yes.
You must be the new Emily.

602
00:41:08,842 --> 00:41:11,510
Nice to meet you.

603
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:15,097
- Oh, let me see that bag. Very, very nice.
- Ah.

604
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:18,642
Distressed, studded leather, pieced by hand,
finished with a metallic fringe.

605
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:21,728
Very nice, indeed.
Who made that fantastic thing?

606
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:23,814
You.

607
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:27,943
Hmm. Duh. This way.

608
00:41:30,697 --> 00:41:32,823
Uh, here we go.

609
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:35,284
It's a sketch of Miranda's dress
for the benefit.

610
00:41:35,368 --> 00:41:38,328
Also the centerpiece of my spring collection.
Top secret stuff.

611
00:41:38,413 --> 00:41:40,581
- I'll guard it with my life.
- Please do.

612
00:41:40,665 --> 00:41:43,000
Come on.
You're working for Miranda Priestly now.

613
00:41:43,084 --> 00:41:47,796
You must be in desperate need
of hard liquor.

614
00:41:47,881 --> 00:41:50,132
Excuse us, girls.

615
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:52,301
She'll have the punch.

616
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,848
It's deadly. Have fun.

617
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:05,814
- He's right, you know.
- Hmm?

618
00:42:05,899 --> 00:42:08,817
The punch.
I drank it at James's last party.

619
00:42:08,902 --> 00:42:12,613
I woke up in Hoboken wearing nothing
but a poncho and a cowboy hat.

620
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:16,033
♪♪ Ah. Well.

621
00:42:16,117 --> 00:42:18,410
Wise.

622
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:21,496
- Uh, hi.
- Christian Thompson.

623
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:25,209
Christian Thompson?
You're kidding.

624
00:42:25,293 --> 00:42:28,879
No, you're- You write for,
like, every magazine I love.

625
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:32,466
I actually- I reviewed your collection
of essays for my college newspaper.

626
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:36,511
Did you mention my good looks
and my killer charm?

627
00:42:36,596 --> 00:42:38,847
- No, but—
- What do you do?

628
00:42:38,932 --> 00:42:43,518
Oh. Well, I want to work for somewhere
like The New Yorker or Vanity Fair.

629
00:42:43,603 --> 00:42:45,562
- I am a writer too.
- Is that right?

630
00:42:45,647 --> 00:42:48,774
- Mm-hmm.
- I should read your stuff.
Why don't you send it over?

631
00:42:48,858 --> 00:42:51,235
Yeah?

632
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:54,988
That would be- Thank you.
That would be great.

633
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:58,492
But actually, right now, I'm working
as Miranda Priestly's assistant.

634
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:00,994
Oh, you're kidding.
Well, that's too bad.

635
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:05,040
That's- Whoa.
You'll never survive Miranda.

636
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:10,045
- Excuse me?
- Well, you seem nice, smart.

637
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:12,297
You can't do that job.

638
00:43:14,092 --> 00:43:16,134
Gotta go.

639
00:43:16,219 --> 00:43:18,136
Okay.

640
00:43:18,221 --> 00:43:21,890
Well, it was very, very nice
to meet you, Miranda girl.

641
00:43:36,781 --> 00:43:38,782
Emily?

642

Tell everybody else.
Be ready to leave in half an hour.

644

<i>But we're not expected until Tuesday.</i>
<i>Did she say why?</i>

645
00:43:57,927 --> 00:44:00,762
Yes. Yeah, she explained every detail
of her decision making.

646
00:44:00,847 --> 00:44:03,807
And then we brushed each other's hair
and gabbed about American Idol.

647
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:05,809
I see your point.

648
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:08,312

- Good morning, Miranda.

649
00:44:08,396 --> 00:44:11,315

<i>- In her way.</i>

00:44:18,531 --> 00:44:22,034
Uh, this season really began for me
with a meditation...

654
00:44:22,118 --> 00:44:24,786
<i>on the intersection</i>
<i>between East and West.</i>

655
00:44:24,871 --> 00:44:28,373
<i>There's a scale.</i>
<i>One nod is good. Two nods is very good.</i>

656
00:44:28,458 --> 00:44:32,627
<i>There's only been one actual smile on record,</i>
<i>and that was Tom Ford in 2001.</i>

657
00:44:32,712 --> 00:44:34,671
An obi belt.

658
00:44:34,756 --> 00:44:36,882
<i>She doesn't like it, she shakes her head.</i>

659
00:44:36,966 --> 00:44:40,761
This is the dress that we have designed
specifically and exclusively for you.

660
00:44:40,845 --> 00:44:43,722
<i>Then, of course,</i>
<i>there's the pursing of the lips.</i>

661
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:45,724
<i>Which means?</i>

662
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:51,730
<i>Catastrophe.</i>

663
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:55,067
Just, uh—Just go.

664
00:44:55,151 --> 00:44:58,862
- I just don't understand. I'm appalled.
- It's absurd. Appalled.

665
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:01,239
- You deal with it.
- I'll talk to him.

666
00:45:01,324 --> 00:45:05,535
So because she pursed her lips,
he's gonna change his entire collection?

667
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:07,579
You still don't get it, do you?

668
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:10,665
Her opinion is the only one
that matters.

669
00:45:12,627 --> 00:45:15,712
- Call my husband and confirm dinner.
- At Pastis? Done.

670
00:45:15,797 --> 00:45:17,798
And I'll need a change of clothes.

671
00:45:17,882 --> 00:45:22,886
Well, I've already messengered
your outfit over to the shoot.

672
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:27,682
Fine. And, Andrea, I would like you
to deliver the Book to my home tonight.

673
00:45:27,767 --> 00:45:30,310
- Have Emily give you the key.
- Mm-hmm.

674
00:45:32,188 --> 00:45:34,940
- Guard this with your life.
- Of course.

675
00:45:36,818 --> 00:45:40,904
You know, if I can deliver the Book,
that means I must have done something right.

676
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:42,906
I'm not a psycho.

677
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:45,534
Oh, and, you know,
she called me Andrea?

678
00:45:45,618 --> 00:45:48,245
I mean, she didn't call me Emily,
which is- Isn't that great?

679
00:45:48,329 --> 00:45:50,956
Yeah, whoopee. Right.

680
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:56,962
Now, it's very important that you do
exactly what I'm about to tell you.

681
00:45:57,046 --> 00:45:59,005
Oh. Okay.

682
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:02,300
<i>The Book is assembled by 10:00, 10:30...</i>

683
00:46:02,385 --> 00:46:05,804
<i>and you must wait around for it</i>
<i>until then.</i>

684
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:09,474
You will be delivering Miranda's
dry cleaning with the Book.

685
00:46:11,978 --> 00:46:15,522
<i>Now, the car will take you straight</i>
<i>to Miranda's townhouse.</i>

686
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:18,024
<i>You let yourself in.</i>

687
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:23,780
Andrea. You do not talk to anyone.

688
00:46:23,865 --> 00:46:25,949
Do not look at anyone.

689
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:28,660
This is of the utmost importance.
You must be invisible.

690
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:31,037
- Do you understand?
- Uh-huh.

691
00:46:31,122 --> 00:46:34,583
<i>You open the door</i>
<i>and you walk across the foyer.</i>

692
00:46:34,667 --> 00:46:39,337
<i>You hang the dry cleaning</i>
<i>in the closet across from the staircase.</i>

693
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:49,890
- Uh—
<i>-And you leave the Book</i>
<i>on the table with the flowers.</i>

694
00:46:56,606 --> 00:47:01,568
- Shit!
<i>- It's that door to the left.</i>

695
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:05,697
Okay.

696
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:16,166
Thank you.

697
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:20,295
- You can give the Book to us.
- Shh. Which— Which table?

698
00:47:20,379 --> 00:47:22,964
<i>- It's okay. Come on up.</i>
- No, I can't. I can't.

699
00:47:23,049 --> 00:47:25,133
- What? It's okay.
- Come on.

700
00:47:25,218 --> 00:47:27,677
<i>- Yeah, come on. It's okay.</i>
- Please stop talking.

701
00:47:27,762 --> 00:47:31,389
Or you can bring the Book upstairs.
Emily does it all the time.

702
00:47:31,474 --> 00:47:35,435
She does? Right.
She does, all the time.

703
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:38,605
Yeah? Okay.

704
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:48,740
<i>What did you expect me to do,</i>
<i>walk out in the middle of a cover shoot?</i>

705
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:50,992
<i>I rushed out of</i>
<i>an investment committee meeting...</i>

706
00:47:51,077 --> 00:47:53,745
and I sat there waiting for you
for almost an hour.

707
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:56,373
<i>I told you the cell phones didn't work.</i>
<i>Nobody could get a signal out.</i>

708
00:47:56,457 --> 00:47:58,583
<i>I knew what everyone</i>
<i>in that restaurant was thinking—</i>

709
00:47:58,668 --> 00:48:01,461
there he is, waiting for her again.

710
00:48:26,112 --> 00:48:28,154
- Okay, okay! Okay, okay.
- Oh, no. Shh!

711
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:30,448
It really wasn't that big a deal.
I promise.

712
00:48:30,533 --> 00:48:33,034
The twins said hello,
so I said hello back.

713
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:37,080
- Then I went up the stairs
to give her the Book and—
- You went upstairs?

714
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:41,001
Oh, my God. Why didn't you just climb into bed
with her and ask for a bedtime story?

715
00:48:41,085 --> 00:48:44,087
Okay, I made a mistake. I know.

716
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:45,880
Andrea, you don't understand.

717
00:48:45,965 --> 00:48:48,925
If you get fired,
that might jeopardize Paris for me.

718
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:53,096
If that happens, I will search every Blimpie's
in the tristate area until I track you down.

719
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:55,181
She's gonna fire me?

720
00:48:55,266 --> 00:48:58,226
I don't know. She's not happy.

721
00:48:58,311 --> 00:49:00,228
<i>Andrea?</i>

722
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:12,741
Miranda, about last night, I—

723
00:49:12,825 --> 00:49:15,410
I need the new Harry Potter book
for the twins.

724
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:18,955
Okay. Okay. I'll go down
to Barnes & Noble right now.

725
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:23,793
<i>Did you fall down and smack</i>
<i>your little head on the pavement?</i>

726
00:49:23,878 --> 00:49:26,504
Not that I can recall.

727
00:49:26,589 --> 00:49:30,467
We have all the published Harry Potter books.
The twins want to know what happens next.

728
00:49:30,551 --> 00:49:34,012
You want the unpublished manuscript?

729
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:37,974
<i>We know everyone in publishing.</i>
<i>It shouldn't be a problem, should it?</i>

730
00:49:38,059 --> 00:49:40,268
And you can do anything, right?

731
00:49:47,735 --> 00:49:50,862
Yes, Bobbsey. I know, baby.

732
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:53,448
Mommy's working very hard
to get it for you.

733
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:55,450
She doesn't get it.

734
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:59,371
I could call frickin' J.K. Rowling herself.
I'm not gonna get a copy of that book.

735
00:49:59,455 --> 00:50:01,665
<i>My girls are leaving on the train</i>
<i>for their grandmother's at 4:00...</i>

736
00:50:01,749 --> 00:50:04,250
so the book better be here
no later than 3:00.

737
00:50:04,335 --> 00:50:09,005
- Of course!
- And I would like my steak here in 15 minutes.

738
00:50:09,090 --> 00:50:11,675
No problem!

739
00:50:11,759 --> 00:50:15,136
<i>Okay. I have four hours</i>
<i>to get the impossible manuscript.</i>

740
00:50:15,221 --> 00:50:19,557
Smith & Wollensky's doesn't open until 11:30.
How am I gonna get the steak?

741
00:50:19,642 --> 00:50:23,228
<i>Okay. I will be back in 15 minutes.</i>

742
00:50:23,312 --> 00:50:25,605
- Wish me luck!
- No. Shan't.

743
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:29,693
Yes, yes, yes, yes. I've been on hold.
It's for Miranda Priestly.

744
00:50:29,777 --> 00:50:31,695
It's very important.

745
00:50:31,779 --> 00:50:34,030
Yes, I know it's impossible to get...

746
00:50:34,115 --> 00:50:37,701
but, well, I was wondering if you
could make the impossible possible...

747
00:50:37,785 --> 00:50:39,786
if that's at all possible.

748
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:43,373
<i>Yes, I'm calling about</i>
<i>the Harry Potter manuscript.</i>

749
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:46,292
<i>Uh, no. Unpublished.</i>

750
00:50:46,377 --> 00:50:48,712
Not a chance?

751
00:50:48,796 --> 00:50:50,797
Tell her that it's for Miranda Priestly.

752
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:53,007
'Cause I think it makes a difference.

753
00:50:56,971 --> 00:50:59,764
Let me call you back.

754
00:50:59,849 --> 00:51:02,767
<i>You probably don't remember me.</i>
<i>We met at James Holt's party.</i>

755
00:51:02,852 --> 00:51:04,853
I'm Miranda Priestly's assistant.

756
00:51:04,937 --> 00:51:08,064
The Harry Potter manuscript?
Oh, you're kidding.

757
00:51:08,149 --> 00:51:11,651
Uh, sorry to ask, but I'm desperate.

758
00:51:11,736 --> 00:51:14,988
Just tell her it can't be done.
You'll have to come up with a Plan "B."

759
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:17,574
Well, this is Miranda Priestly
we're talking about.

760
00:51:17,658 --> 00:51:19,826
There is no Plan "B."
There's only Plan "A."

761
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:23,246
Is she back? Am I fired?

762
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:26,207
I rarely say this to people
who aren't me...

763
00:51:26,292 --> 00:51:29,043
but you have got to calm down.

764
00:51:29,128 --> 00:51:31,129
Bloody hell!

765
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:38,553
Coat, bag.

766
00:51:40,681 --> 00:51:44,726
What's that? Oh, I don't want that.
I'm having lunch with Irv.

767
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:47,854
I'll be back at 3:00.
I'd like my Starbucks waiting.

768
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:53,026
<i>Oh, and if you don't have</i>
<i>that Harry Potter book by then...</i>

769
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:55,820
<i>don't even bother coming back.</i>

770
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:10,960
Hello.

771
00:52:11,045 --> 00:52:13,004
Quit? Are you sure?

772
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:15,131
I failed.
She's gonna fire me anyway.

773
00:52:15,216 --> 00:52:17,717
- I might as well beat her to the punch.
- Wow.

774
00:52:17,802 --> 00:52:21,638
Andy, good for you.
Congratulations. You're free.

775
00:52:21,722 --> 00:52:24,808
- Yeah. Well, listen, I'll call you later.
- Okay.

776
00:52:24,892 --> 00:52:27,435
Hello.

777
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,479
I'm brilliant. No, really.

778
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:33,817
- Monuments should be erected in my honor.
- You didn't.

779
00:52:33,901 --> 00:52:36,361
Oh, yes. A friend of a friend
does the cover art...

780
00:52:36,445 --> 00:52:38,404
and she happens
to have the manuscript.

781
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:44,661
Oh, no, 'cause that would mean
that I actually did something right.

782
00:52:44,745 --> 00:52:47,997
It's just- Oh!

783
00:52:48,082 --> 00:52:49,999
The thing is, Christian, I was just—

784
00:52:50,084 --> 00:52:53,461
Look, you want this thing, you better hurry.
I'll meet you at the St. Regis.

785
00:53:02,263 --> 00:53:04,222
Excuse me.

786
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:17,861
- Welcome to the St. Regis.
May I assist you with anything?
- Oh. Yes.

787
00:53:17,945 --> 00:53:20,989
- Uh, I'm meeting someone at the King Cole Bar.
- Right this way.

788
00:53:23,576 --> 00:53:25,493
Hi.

789
00:53:25,578 --> 00:53:28,288
- You have one hour.
- Thank you.

790
00:53:38,132 --> 00:53:42,719
One copy. What are my twins
gonna do with that? Share?

791
00:53:42,803 --> 00:53:44,721
Oh, no, I made two copies...

792
00:53:44,805 --> 00:53:48,266
and had them covered, reset and bound
so that they wouldn't look like manuscripts.

793
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:52,186
This is an extra copy to have on file.
You know, just in case.

794
00:53:52,271 --> 00:53:55,231
Well, where are these fabulous copies?
I don't see them anywhere.

795
00:53:58,152 --> 00:54:01,321
<i>They're with the twins,</i>
<i>on the train on the way to Grandma's.</i>

796
00:54:03,741 --> 00:54:05,658
<i>Is there anything else</i>
<i>I can do for you?</i>

797
00:54:07,536 --> 00:54:11,080
Mm-mmm. That's all.

798
00:54:11,165 --> 00:54:12,832
Okay.

799
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:31,601
<i>- Hey.</i>
- Hey. I went to Dean & Deluca.

800
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:34,771
Man, they charge, like,
five dollars a strawberry there.

801
00:54:34,855 --> 00:54:38,358
But I figure since you quit your job...

802
00:54:38,442 --> 00:54:40,485
we should celebrate.

803
00:54:40,569 --> 00:54:43,613
- Listen, Nate.
- Wait a minute.

804
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:46,574
You quit your job, but you're still working
on the twins, science project?

805
00:54:48,911 --> 00:54:51,079
Well, that's big of you.

806
00:54:51,163 --> 00:54:54,749
Okay, after we talked, I realized...

807
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:59,921
<i>it doesn't make sense throwing away</i>
<i>all those months of hard work.</i>

808
00:55:00,005 --> 00:55:02,298
I just had a moment of weakness,
that's all.

809
00:55:02,383 --> 00:55:05,843
Yeah, well, either that,
or your job sucks and your boss is a wacko.

810
00:55:09,056 --> 00:55:12,725
All right. Whatever. It's your job.

811
00:55:15,729 --> 00:55:18,022
<i>Nate.</i>

812
00:55:18,107 --> 00:55:20,274
Come on.

813
00:55:20,359 --> 00:55:22,443
I'm still the same person I was.

814
00:55:22,528 --> 00:55:25,989
I still want the same things. Okay?

815
00:55:26,073 --> 00:55:30,159
- Mm-hmm.
- I promise, same Andy. Better clothes.

816
00:55:30,244 --> 00:55:33,413
I like the old clothes.

817
00:55:34,915 --> 00:55:37,500
Really?

818
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:40,586
Well, what about these necklaces?
Do you like them?

819
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:45,591
No? And this dress, it's new.

820
00:55:45,676 --> 00:55:47,719
Eh.

821
00:55:47,803 --> 00:55:51,514
Well, there is one other thing
that's new...

822
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:53,599
that I thought you might like.

823
00:55:53,684 --> 00:55:57,228
But, uh— What about this?

824
00:55:59,148 --> 00:56:01,024
You don't like it.
I should better do—

825
00:56:01,108 --> 00:56:03,067
No, no, no, no.

826
00:56:22,087 --> 00:56:25,173
<i>Is this number two look?</i>
<i>This is number two?</i>

827
00:56:25,257 --> 00:56:29,510
- Hi.
- Hi. All right. Turn around for me, darling.

828
00:56:29,595 --> 00:56:31,846
Oh, I get it. I get it. I get it.

829
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:33,973
<i>The piece is called "urban jungle," right?</i>

830
00:56:34,058 --> 00:56:37,643
Yes, the modern woman unleashes
the animal within to take on the big city.

831
00:56:37,728 --> 00:56:40,605
Good. Go.

832
00:56:40,689 --> 00:56:44,192
Sometimes I can't believe
I talk about this crap all day.

833
00:56:44,276 --> 00:56:46,778
- Bobby, come here. Let me see.
- Oh, thank you.

834
00:56:46,862 --> 00:56:49,072
- Make sure Miranda gets these as soon as possible.
- Mm-hmm.

835
00:56:49,156 --> 00:56:51,407
And tell her I switched in the Dior
for the Rocha.

836
00:56:51,492 --> 00:56:56,037
- Oh, great. Can't wait.
- Excuse me.

837
00:56:56,121 --> 00:56:58,414
- Can we adjust the attitude?
- I'm sorry.

838
00:56:58,499 --> 00:57:01,709
- Don't make me feed you to one of the models.
- I'm sorry.

839
00:57:01,794 --> 00:57:03,711
It's a busy day.

840
00:57:03,796 --> 00:57:06,089
My personal life
is hanging by a thread, that's all.

841
00:57:06,173 --> 00:57:09,467
Join the club. That's what happens
when you start doing well at work, darling.

842
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:12,762
Let me know when your whole life
goes up in smoke.

843
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:14,847
That means it's time for a promotion.

844
00:57:22,523 --> 00:57:25,399
No. All right, February,
back of the issue.

845
00:57:25,484 --> 00:57:28,069
<i>Did anybody speak</i>
<i>with Salma's people yet?</i>

846
00:57:28,153 --> 00:57:30,905
<i>Yes, but she'd rather do a summer cover</i>
<i>because she has a movie coming out.</i>

847
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:35,201
No. Also, I'm pulling the Toobin piece
on the Supreme Court women—

848
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:36,953
woman.

849
00:57:37,037 --> 00:57:39,539
<i>And I need to see a new draft</i>
<i>on that piece...</i>

850
00:57:39,623 --> 00:57:41,958
about shopping for a plastic surgeon—
It's dull.

851
00:57:42,042 --> 00:57:46,629
<i>And this layout</i>
<i>for the Winter Wonderland spread.</i>

852
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:49,048
Not wonderful yet.

853
00:57:49,133 --> 00:57:50,967
Oh, okay. I-I'll look at it.

854
00:57:51,051 --> 00:57:53,636
What about Testino?
Where are we on that?

855
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:55,805
Zac Posen's doing
some very sculptural suits.

856
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:58,808
So I suggested that, uh, Testino
shoot them at the Noguchi Garden.

857
00:57:58,892 --> 00:58:00,685
Perfect.

858
00:58:00,769 --> 00:58:03,354
<i>Thank God somebody came to work today.</i>

859
00:58:03,438 --> 00:58:06,190
What about accessories for April?

860
00:58:06,275 --> 00:58:09,819
One thought I had was enamel.
Um, bangles, pendants, earrings.

861
00:58:09,903 --> 00:58:12,029
No. We did that two years ago.
What else?

862
00:58:12,114 --> 00:58:15,449
Um, well, they're showing a lot of florals
right now, so I was thinking—

863
00:58:15,534 --> 00:58:19,954
Florals? For spring? Groundbreaking.

864
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:22,498
<i>But we thought about shooting them</i>
<i>in an industrial space.</i>

865
00:58:22,583 --> 00:58:25,418
We thought the contrast
between the femininity of the florals...

866
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:28,254
<i>and the more raw, rough-hewn background</i>
<i>would create this wonderful tension between—</i>

867
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:31,132
- No.
- Which?

868
00:58:31,216 --> 00:58:34,302
No.

869
00:58:39,808 --> 00:58:42,643
Does anybody else
have anything I can possibly use?

870
00:58:43,729 --> 00:58:46,606
Antibacterial wipes perhaps?

871
00:58:51,111 --> 00:58:55,281
<i>- How's the cold doing?</i>
- Like death warmed up actually.

872
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:57,491
Oh, God.

873
00:58:57,576 --> 00:59:00,870
It's the benefit tonight.
I've been looking forward to it for months.

874
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:04,165
I refuse to be sick.
I'm wearing Valentino, for crying out loud.

875
00:59:05,834 --> 00:59:09,045
<i>Right. Well, everybody will</i>
<i>be leaving soon to get ready...</i>

876
00:59:09,129 --> 00:59:13,174
so I suggest you go and drop Miranda's
Fendi bag off at the showroom...

877
00:59:13,258 --> 00:59:15,218
and then I suppose you can just go home.

878
00:59:15,302 --> 00:59:20,514
Yeah? Oh, well, that is great.
Perfect actually.

879
00:59:20,599 --> 00:59:23,935
I need to get to Magnolia Bakery before it closes.
It's Nate's birthday tonight.

880
00:59:24,019 --> 00:59:26,687
<i>So we're, uh,</i>
<i>having a little party for him.</i>

881
00:59:26,772 --> 00:59:29,857
Yeah, I'm hearing this,
and I wanna hear this.

882
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:33,527
Bye.

883
00:59:34,738 --> 00:59:38,115
I love my job.
I love my job. I love my job.

884
00:59:46,667 --> 00:59:48,709
Hello?

885
00:59:52,339 --> 00:59:54,882
<i>Before the benefit tonight,</i>
<i>I need to make sure...</i>

886
00:59:54,967 --> 00:59:57,635
that you're both fully prepped
on the guest list.

887
00:59:57,719 --> 01:00:03,307
But I thought that only
the first assistant went to the benefit.

888
01:00:03,392 --> 01:00:05,893
Only when the first assistant
hasn't decided to become...

889
01:00:05,978 --> 01:00:08,521
an incubus of viral plague.

890
01:00:09,773 --> 01:00:12,942
<i>You'll come and help Emily.</i>

891
01:00:13,026 --> 01:00:16,320
- That's all.
- Right.

892
01:00:16,405 --> 01:00:19,782
These are all of the guests.
Miranda invites everyone.

893
01:00:19,866 --> 01:00:23,536
We have to make sure that they all think
she knows exactly who they are.

894
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:25,788
And I've been studying for weeks.

895
01:00:25,872 --> 01:00:27,665
I have to learn all these by tonight?

896
01:00:27,749 --> 01:00:30,960
No, don't be silly, Andrea.
These too.

897
01:00:31,044 --> 01:00:34,880
Look, you better just start without me, okay?
I'll get there as soon as I can.

898
01:00:34,965 --> 01:00:37,133
Andy, come on, it's his birth—

899
01:00:37,217 --> 01:00:39,260
Okay, but hurry.

900
01:00:39,344 --> 01:00:42,096
Oh, please, believe me, I will.
This is the last thing that I wanna—

901
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:46,017
Ooh, I love that. Uh, I'll call you
the second I'm leaving, okay?

902
01:00:46,101 --> 01:00:48,602
- Will that fit me?
<i>- Oh, yeah.</i>

903
01:00:48,687 --> 01:00:51,439
A little Crisco and some fishing line,
and we're in business.

904
01:01:18,884 --> 01:01:20,885
Well, nothing really. I mean, this is-

905
01:01:20,969 --> 01:01:25,181
I mean, really, this is
the social event of the season.

906
01:01:39,905 --> 01:01:43,783
Oh, oh, my God.
Andy, you look so chic.

907
01:01:43,867 --> 01:01:47,536
Oh, thanks, Em. You look so thin.

908
01:01:47,621 --> 01:01:49,538
- Do I?
- Yeah.

909
01:01:49,623 --> 01:01:52,041
Oh, it's for Paris.
I'm on this new diet.

910
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:54,043
It's very effective.
Well, I don't eat anything.

911
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:57,546
And then when I feel like I'm about to faint,
I eat a cube of cheese.

912
01:01:57,631 --> 01:01:59,548
- Well, it's definitely working.
- I know.

913
01:01:59,633 --> 01:02:02,176
I'm just one stomach flu
away from my goal weight.

914
01:02:18,276 --> 01:02:23,155
That's John Folger, the new
artistic director of the Chelsea Rep.

915
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:25,699
-John, thanks for coming.
- Hey there.

916
01:02:25,784 --> 01:02:28,536
<i>- Oh, thank you.</i>
<i>It's always nice seeing you.</i>
- Stop fidgeting.

917
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:31,247
I'm sorry. I'm so late.

918
01:02:31,331 --> 01:02:33,374
Just deal with it.
You have to be here.

919
01:02:38,797 --> 01:02:40,923
Emily, come here.

920
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:43,884
<i>Isn't that Jacqueline Follet</i>
from French Runway?

921
01:02:43,969 --> 01:02:46,137
Oh, my God, and Miranda hates her.

922
01:02:46,221 --> 01:02:48,222
She was supposed to arrive
after Miranda left.

923
01:02:48,306 --> 01:02:49,807
- I didn't— Oh.
- Yeah.

924
01:02:49,891 --> 01:02:54,562
- Miranda, fabulous event as always.
- You brought Jacqueline.

925
01:02:54,646 --> 01:02:57,314
<i>- Surprise.</i>
<i>- Quelle surprise.</i>

926
01:02:59,526 --> 01:03:03,946
Oh, wonderful. We're so happy you were
able to come to our little gathering.

927
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:07,783
Of course.
I plan my whole year around this.

928
01:03:07,868 --> 01:03:12,705
Well, we're so grateful that you do.

929
01:03:14,124 --> 01:03:17,251
<i>- Ciao.</i>
- Have you gotten my note?

930
01:03:17,335 --> 01:03:19,628
Yes, I did.
We'll discuss it on Wednesday.

931
01:03:19,713 --> 01:03:23,257
- Yes, I agree. No business tonight.
- Not tonight.

932
01:03:23,341 --> 01:03:25,301
Enjoy.

933
01:03:25,385 --> 01:03:27,595
Em.

934
01:03:27,679 --> 01:03:29,680
Oh, thanks. Thanks.

935
01:03:33,935 --> 01:03:38,189
Oh, um— Oh, my God.
I just can't remember what his name is.

936
01:03:38,273 --> 01:03:40,774
<i>I just saw his name this morning</i>
<i>on the list.</i>

937
01:03:40,859 --> 01:03:43,736
It's- Oh, I know this.
It's something to do with—

938
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:48,949
Wait, he was— he was part of the—
Oh, God, I know this. Um—

939
01:03:49,034 --> 01:03:53,704
It's Ambassador Franklin, and that's
the woman that he left his wife for, Rebecca.

940
01:03:56,541 --> 01:03:59,001
- Rebecca. Ambassador.
- Miranda.

941
01:03:59,085 --> 01:04:01,837
<i>- You look fabulous.</i>
<i>- Oh, very kind.</i>

942
01:04:01,922 --> 01:04:05,216
- Thank you.

943
01:04:13,099 --> 01:04:15,017
- Look at you.
- Hello.

944
01:04:15,101 --> 01:04:17,228
You're- You're a vision.

945
01:04:17,312 --> 01:04:20,022
- Oh.
- Thank God I saved your job.

946
01:04:20,106 --> 01:04:24,985
You know,
I figured out a few things on my own too.

947
01:04:25,070 --> 01:04:27,446
Turns out,
I'm not as nice as you thought.

948
01:04:27,531 --> 01:04:30,032
I hope not.

949
01:04:30,116 --> 01:04:32,243
Well, if it weren't
for the stupid boyfriend...

950
01:04:32,327 --> 01:04:35,329
I'd have to whisk you away
right here and now.

951
01:04:36,873 --> 01:04:40,626
- Do you actually say things like that to people?
- Evidently.

952
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:43,420
Well, I gotta go.

953
01:04:43,505 --> 01:04:46,423
Are you sure? 'Cause my editor
for New York Magazine is inside...

954
01:04:46,508 --> 01:04:48,551
and, you know,
I could introduce you two.

955
01:04:48,635 --> 01:04:53,264
- You sent over your stuff
for me to look at? Remember?
- Yeah.

956
01:04:53,348 --> 01:04:58,102
All right, I gotta admit, I only read a couple.
It was a very large packet you sent.

957
01:04:58,186 --> 01:05:00,104
- Yeah.
- But what I did read wasn't half bad.

958
01:05:00,188 --> 01:05:02,648
And, you know, I think—
I think you have a talent, Andy.

959
01:05:02,732 --> 01:05:05,568
He should meet you.

960
01:05:05,652 --> 01:05:07,736
Why don't you come in?
Just for one drink.

961
01:05:07,821 --> 01:05:11,949
Um, okay, yeah.
I guess I could for one—

962
01:05:12,033 --> 01:05:15,244
No, I can't.
I'm sorry, but I have to go.

963
01:05:15,328 --> 01:05:18,956
All right.
Give my best to the boyfriend.

964
01:05:26,172 --> 01:05:28,382
Roy, I'm sorry.
Can you go any faster?

965
01:05:28,466 --> 01:05:31,302
I'm sure Nate will understand.

966
01:05:33,430 --> 01:05:35,347
Yeah.

967
01:05:38,351 --> 01:05:40,185
<i>Hey.</i>

968
01:05:55,285 --> 01:05:57,578
Happy birthday.

969
01:06:01,625 --> 01:06:04,501
Nate, I'm so sorry.

970
01:06:04,586 --> 01:06:08,672
I kept trying to leave,
but there was a lot going on.

971
01:06:08,757 --> 01:06:10,883
And, you know, I didn't have a choice.

972
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:12,885
Don't worry about it.

973
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:16,055
I'm gonna go to bed.

974
01:06:17,974 --> 01:06:20,392

01:21:19,250 --> 01:21:23,503
Well, if you speak to him
and he decides to rethink the divorce...

1138
01:21:23,587 --> 01:21:26,631
<i>then, yes, fetch away.</i>

1139
01:21:26,715 --> 01:21:30,176
You're very fetching, so go fetch.

1140
01:21:35,474 --> 01:21:39,727
And then when we get back to New York,
we need to contact, um...

1141
01:21:41,438 --> 01:21:45,316
Leslie to see what she can do
to minimize the press...

1142
01:21:46,694 --> 01:21:48,653
on all this.

1143
01:21:51,824 --> 01:21:54,242
Another divorce...

1144
01:21:54,326 --> 01:21:57,412
<i>splashed across page six.</i>

1145
01:21:57,496 --> 01:22:00,582
I can just imagine what they're
gonna write about me.

1146
01:22:00,666 --> 01:22:04,919
The Dragon Lady, career-obsessed.

1147
01:22:05,004 --> 01:22:08,464
Snow Queen drives away
another Mr. Priestly.

1148
01:22:09,675 --> 01:22:12,218
<i>Rupert Murdoch</i>
<i>should cut me a check...</i>

1149
01:22:12,303 --> 01:22:14,846
<i>for all the papers I sell for him.</i>

1150
01:22:16,807 --> 01:22:18,933
Anyway, I don't—

1151
01:22:19,018 --> 01:22:22,145
I don't really care
what anybody writes about me.

1152
01:22:24,523 --> 01:22:27,525
But my— my girls, I just—

1153
01:22:27,610 --> 01:22:30,987
It's just so unfair to the girls.

1154
01:22:31,071 --> 01:22:33,031
It's just...

1155
01:22:35,367 --> 01:22:37,368
another disappointment...

1156
01:22:37,453 --> 01:22:41,080
another letdown,
another father... figure—

1157
01:22:41,165 --> 01:22:44,083
<i>gone.</i>

1158
01:22:45,252 --> 01:22:49,339
Anyway, the point is—

1159
01:22:49,423 --> 01:22:53,051
<i>The point is—</i>

1160
01:22:53,135 --> 01:22:57,388
The point is we really need to
figure out where to place Donatella...

1161
01:22:57,473 --> 01:23:00,558
<i>because she's barely</i>
<i>speaking to anyone.</i>

1162
01:23:10,069 --> 01:23:13,112
<i>I'm so sorry, Miranda.</i>

1163
01:23:13,197 --> 01:23:15,782
If you want me to cancel
your evening, I can.

1164
01:23:15,866 --> 01:23:19,118
Don't be ridiculous.
Why would we do that?

1165
01:23:20,204 --> 01:23:22,497
Um, is—

1166
01:23:22,581 --> 01:23:24,582
Is there anything else I can do?

1167
01:23:26,085 --> 01:23:28,127
Your job.

1168
01:23:31,256 --> 01:23:33,257
That's all.

1169
01:23:59,284 --> 01:24:01,369
Hi. I need Miranda's itinerary
for tomorrow.

1170
01:24:01,453 --> 01:24:03,413
- Okay. Come on in.
- All right? Thanks.

1171
01:24:08,043 --> 01:24:10,878
- Who put that together for you?
- This?

1172
01:24:10,963 --> 01:24:14,006
Oh, it's just—
it's just something I threw on.

1173
01:24:14,091 --> 01:24:17,218
Turn around. Let me see. Turn.

1174
01:24:17,302 --> 01:24:21,180
<i>- Mm. Incroyable.</i>
- Yeah?

1175
01:24:21,265 --> 01:24:24,267
- It's really just— No, it's- No, gorgeous.
- Yeah? Okay, good.

1176
01:24:24,351 --> 01:24:27,603
Really. I think that
my work here is done.

1177
01:24:27,688 --> 01:24:29,772
Oh.

1178
01:24:29,857 --> 01:24:32,358
We're going to celebrate.
I'm going to get some champagne.

1179
01:24:32,443 --> 01:24:34,652
Okay. What are we toasting?

1180
01:24:34,737 --> 01:24:39,449
<i>We are toasting, my dear,</i>
<i>to the dream job.</i>

1181
01:24:39,533 --> 01:24:43,536
The one that a million girls wanted.

1182
01:24:43,620 --> 01:24:46,164
Which I got months ago.

1183
01:24:46,248 --> 01:24:48,708
I'm not talking about you.

1184
01:24:48,792 --> 01:24:51,502
Mm-hmm.

1185
01:24:51,587 --> 01:24:53,880
-James Holt—
- Yeah.

1186
01:24:53,964 --> 01:24:55,882
Massimo Corteleoni...

1187
01:24:57,468 --> 01:24:59,927
is investing in James's company
and taking it global.

1188
01:25:00,012 --> 01:25:04,223
- Mm-hmm.
- Bags, shoes, fragrances— the works.

1189
01:25:05,350 --> 01:25:08,603
And James needs a partner.

1190
01:25:08,687 --> 01:25:14,567
And that partner would be me.

1191
01:25:16,695 --> 01:25:19,030
- Does Miranda—
- No, no, Miranda knows, because—

1192
01:25:19,114 --> 01:25:21,741
- Oh.
- Oh, she put me up for it.
God, no. Can you imagine?

1193
01:25:21,825 --> 01:25:24,243
But- But— But you're leaving.

1194
01:25:24,328 --> 01:25:27,121
- Mm-hmm.
- I can't imagine Runway without you.

1195
01:25:27,206 --> 01:25:30,291
I know, I know,
but I'm so excited though.

1196
01:25:30,375 --> 01:25:34,629
This is the first time in 18 years I'm going
to be able to call the shots in my own life.

1197
01:25:34,713 --> 01:25:37,173
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

1198
01:25:37,257 --> 01:25:42,386
I'm going to be able to come to Paris
and actually see Paris.

1199
01:25:44,389 --> 01:25:46,891
Well, congratulations.

1200
01:25:46,975 --> 01:25:50,228
- Huh? Oh.
- Nigel, you deserve it.

1201
01:25:52,523 --> 01:25:55,817
You bet your size-six ass.

1202
01:25:55,901 --> 01:25:59,111
- Four.
- Really?

1203
01:25:59,196 --> 01:26:01,113
Cheers.

1204
01:26:01,198 --> 01:26:04,826
- Cheers to you.
- To us.

1205
01:26:04,910 --> 01:26:07,161
Let me see that.

1206
01:26:10,749 --> 01:26:15,586
Okay, I just wanna say that yes, there are things
Miranda does that I don't agree with, but-

1207
01:26:15,671 --> 01:26:18,339
- Come on. You hate her.Just admit it to me.
- No.

1208
01:26:18,423 --> 01:26:20,883
She's a— She's a notorious sadist...

1209
01:26:20,968 --> 01:26:23,135
and not— not in a good way.

1210
01:26:23,220 --> 01:26:26,514
Okay, she's tough,
but if Miranda were a man...

1211
01:26:26,598 --> 01:26:30,184
no one would notice anything about her,
except how great she is at her job.

1212
01:26:30,269 --> 01:26:33,229
I'm sorry. I can't—

1213
01:26:33,313 --> 01:26:36,399
- I can't believe this. You're defending her?
- Yeah.

1214
01:26:36,483 --> 01:26:39,735
The wide-eyed girl peddling
her earnest newspaper stories?

1215
01:26:39,820 --> 01:26:42,989
You, my friend,
are crossing over to the dark side.

1216
01:26:44,575 --> 01:26:46,492
I resent that.

1217
01:26:46,577 --> 01:26:49,787
- You shouldn't. It's sexy.
- Sexy?

1218
01:26:52,791 --> 01:26:55,793
- Really?
- Really.

1219
01:27:00,257 --> 01:27:02,717
So do you—
do you know where we're going?

1220
01:27:02,801 --> 01:27:04,427
- 'Cause I'm lost.
- Yeah.

1221
01:27:04,511 --> 01:27:07,179
Yeah, don't worry. I know this city
like the back of my hand.

1222
01:27:07,264 --> 01:27:10,349
It's my favorite place
in the whole world.

1223
01:27:10,434 --> 01:27:12,351
You know, Gertrude Stein once said...

1224
01:27:12,436 --> 01:27:16,981
"America is my country,
and Paris is my hometown."

1225
01:27:17,065 --> 01:27:19,233
It's true.

1226
01:27:19,318 --> 01:27:21,277
What do you do?

1227
01:27:21,361 --> 01:27:23,404
Do you just write stuff like that down...

1228
01:27:23,488 --> 01:27:26,991
and then file it away to use on us girls?

1229
01:27:27,075 --> 01:27:30,578
- I'm Christian Thompson. That's my way.
- That's your way. Right.

1230
01:27:30,662 --> 01:27:33,331
I work freelance.
I have a lot of free time on my hands.

1231
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:37,919
You know, I never understood...

1232
01:27:38,003 --> 01:27:41,088
why everyone was so crazy about Paris...

1233
01:27:41,173 --> 01:27:46,010
but... it is so beautiful.

1234
01:27:48,430 --> 01:27:52,808
Mm. I-I can't. I'm sorry.

1235
01:27:52,893 --> 01:27:57,772
I can't. You know, Nate and I just split up
a couple days ago, and I can't.

1236
01:28:00,943 --> 01:28:03,402
Ooh. I've had too much wine.

1237
01:28:03,487 --> 01:28:07,031
And my hearing— vision—
judgment's impaired.

1238
01:28:10,869 --> 01:28:13,829
No, I barely know you.
I'm in a strange city.

1239
01:28:15,707 --> 01:28:19,835
I... am out of excuses.

1240
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:21,712
Thank God.

1241
01:29:10,053 --> 01:29:11,971
Yes.

1242
01:29:15,475 --> 01:29:17,601
Oh, shoot.

1243
01:29:25,736 --> 01:29:27,945
<i>Bonjour, madame.</i>

1244
01:29:28,030 --> 01:29:30,489
Uh, what the hell is this?

1245
01:29:30,574 --> 01:29:33,826
What does it look like?
It's a mock-up.

1246
01:29:33,910 --> 01:29:36,037
Yeah. Of?

1247
01:29:36,121 --> 01:29:41,292
Of what American Runway will look like
when Jacqueline Follet is the new editor in chief.

1248
01:29:41,376 --> 01:29:44,503
Wh— They're replacing Miranda?

1249
01:29:44,588 --> 01:29:48,424
Yeah. And she's bringing me in
to run all the editorial content.

1250
01:29:50,677 --> 01:29:52,928
You're really surprised?

1251
01:29:53,013 --> 01:29:56,807
Jacqueline's a lot younger than Miranda.
She has a fresher take on things.

1252
01:29:56,892 --> 01:30:02,354
<i>Not to mention American Runway's one</i>
<i>of the most expensive books in the business.</i>

1253
01:30:02,439 --> 01:30:06,567
<i>Jacqueline does the same thing</i>
<i>fora lot less money.</i>

1254
01:30:06,651 --> 01:30:10,196
And Irv—
Irv's a businessman, you know.

1255
01:30:10,280 --> 01:30:14,575
Miranda will be devastated. Her whole life
is about Runway. He can't do that to her.

1256
01:30:14,659 --> 01:30:18,162
It's done. Irv's gonna tell Miranda
after the party for James.

1257
01:30:18,246 --> 01:30:20,289
And she has no idea?

1258
01:30:20,373 --> 01:30:22,875
She's a big girl. She'll be fine.

1259
01:30:24,086 --> 01:30:27,213
Shi— I have to go.

1260
01:30:27,297 --> 01:30:29,298
Andy.

1261
01:30:29,382 --> 01:30:31,592
Andy, it's done.

1262
01:30:31,676 --> 01:30:33,844
Baby, it's done.

1263
01:30:35,222 --> 01:30:37,681
I'm not your baby.

1264
01:30:45,857 --> 01:30:48,275
<i>Allo.</i>

1265
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:50,820
Oh! Oh! Thank God you're there.

1266
01:30:50,904 --> 01:30:53,614
- Excuse me?
- I need to talk to you right away.

1267
01:30:53,698 --> 01:30:55,991
It's about Jacqueline Follet.

1268
01:30:56,076 --> 01:31:00,704
Shit! Oh, shit! Shit, shit, shit!

1269
01:31:16,888 --> 01:31:20,891
- Yes.
- Mr. Ravitz, I'm so sorry to bother you.
I was wondering—

1270
01:31:20,976 --> 01:31:23,602
Have you completely lost your mind?

1271
01:31:23,687 --> 01:31:27,857
- I need to talk to you.
- Do not disturb me again.

1272
01:31:27,941 --> 01:31:31,026
But, um, it's just for one— Miranda!

1273
01:31:49,171 --> 01:31:52,923
Miranda. Miranda.
Wait, I need to talk to you.

1274
01:31:53,008 --> 01:31:55,593
Irv is making Jacqueline Follet
the editor in chief of Runway.

1275
01:31:55,677 --> 01:31:57,678
Christian Thompson told me
he's gonna work for her.

1276
01:31:57,762 --> 01:32:01,223
Irv is going to tell you today. I thought
maybe if I told you, that you could fix it.

1277
01:32:01,308 --> 01:32:03,225
Do I smell freesias?

1278
01:32:03,310 --> 01:32:07,521
What? No.
I-I specifically told them—

1279
01:32:07,606 --> 01:32:12,067
If I see freesias anywhere...

1280
01:32:12,152 --> 01:32:15,404
I will be very disappointed.

1281
01:32:15,488 --> 01:32:19,950
<i>For 72years, Runway</i>
<i>has been more than a magazine.</i>

1282

and his many accomplishments...

1292
01:33:26,017 --> 01:33:29,853

01:33:31,731 --> 01:33:34,858
<i>Um, as many of you know...</i>

1294

01:34:03,930 --> 01:34:08,517
for James to choose the new president
of James Holt International...

1302
01:34:08,601 --> 01:34:11,562
<i>he chose from within</i>
the Runway family.

1303
01:34:11,646 --> 01:34:15,733
<i>And it's my great happiness today...</i>

1304
01:34:15,817 --> 01:34:19,528
to announce to you all
that that person...

1305
01:34:19,612 --> 01:34:24,992
<i>is my friend</i>
<i>and longtime esteemed colleague...</i>

1306
01:34:25,076 --> 01:34:27,036
Jacqueline Follet.

1307
01:34:39,841 --> 01:34:41,800
Thank you. Merci.

1308
01:34:58,526 --> 01:35:01,236
<i>And now to the main event...</i>

1309
01:35:01,321 --> 01:35:04,573
<i>our celebration of James Holt.</i>

1310
01:35:04,657 --> 01:35:07,451
<i>We at Runway</i>
are very proud to have been—

1311
01:35:09,120 --> 01:35:11,538
When the time is right,
she'll pay me back.

1312
01:35:14,459 --> 01:35:17,044
You sure about that?

1313
01:35:17,128 --> 01:35:19,421
No.

1314
01:35:19,506 --> 01:35:22,549
But I hope for the best.

1315
01:35:22,634 --> 01:35:25,135
I have to.

1316
01:35:44,322 --> 01:35:46,532
You thought I didn't know.

1317
01:35:48,493 --> 01:35:52,037
I've known what was happening
for quite some time.

1318
01:35:52,122 --> 01:35:57,709
<i>It just took me a little while to find</i>
<i>a suitable alternative for Jacqueline.</i>

1319
01:35:57,794 --> 01:36:03,173
<i>And that James Holt job</i>
<i>was so absurdly overpaid...</i>

1320
01:36:03,258 --> 01:36:06,009
that, of course, she jumped at it.

1321
01:36:06,094 --> 01:36:10,264
<i>So I just had to tell Irv</i>
<i>that Jacqueline was unavailable.</i>

1322
01:36:10,348 --> 01:36:14,977
The truth is, there is no one
that can do what I do...

1323
01:36:15,061 --> 01:36:17,729
including her.

1324
01:36:17,814 --> 01:36:21,316
Any of the other choices would
have found that job impossible...

1325
01:36:21,401 --> 01:36:23,402
and the magazine would have suffered.

1326
01:36:23,486 --> 01:36:27,364
Especially because of the list.

1327
01:36:28,700 --> 01:36:32,286
The list of designers, photographers...

1328
01:36:32,370 --> 01:36:36,373
<i>editors, writers, models, all of whom</i>
<i>were found by me, nurtured by me...</i>

1329
01:36:36,458 --> 01:36:39,293
and have promised me
they will follow me...

1330
01:36:39,377 --> 01:36:42,546
whenever and if ever
I choose to leave Runway.

1331
01:36:44,632 --> 01:36:46,758
<i>So he reconsidered.</i>

1332
01:36:50,430 --> 01:36:53,682
<i>But I was very, very impressed...</i>

1333
01:36:53,766 --> 01:36:56,810
by how intently you tried to warn me.

1334
01:36:56,895 --> 01:37:00,063
I never thought I would say this,
Andrea...

1335
01:37:00,148 --> 01:37:03,692
but I really-

1336
01:37:03,776 --> 01:37:06,069
I see a great deal of myself in you.

1337
01:37:09,574 --> 01:37:13,660
You can see beyond what people want
and what they need...

1338
01:37:13,745 --> 01:37:16,246
and you can choose for yourself.

1339
01:37:19,459 --> 01:37:23,462
I don't think I'm like that.

1340
01:37:23,546 --> 01:37:25,881
I—

1341
01:37:28,718 --> 01:37:30,636
I couldn't do what you did to Nigel,
Miranda.

1342
01:37:30,720 --> 01:37:33,472
I couldn't do something like that.

1343
01:37:33,556 --> 01:37:36,934
Mm. You already did.

1344
01:37:40,813 --> 01:37:42,731
To Emily.

1345
01:37:42,815 --> 01:37:46,527
That's not what I—

1346
01:37:46,611 --> 01:37:49,029
No, that was- that was different.
I didn't have a choice.

1347
01:37:49,113 --> 01:37:53,158
<i>Oh, no, you chose.</i>
<i>You chose to get ahead.</i>

1348
01:37:53,243 --> 01:37:57,371
You want this life,
those choices are necessary.

1349
01:37:57,455 --> 01:38:02,084
But what if this isn't what I want?

1350
01:38:02,168 --> 01:38:06,547
I mean, what if I don't wanna
live the way you live?

1351
01:38:06,631 --> 01:38:09,758
Don't be ridiculous, Andrea.
Everybody wants this.

1352
01:38:11,803 --> 01:38:14,513
<i>Everybody wants to be us.</i>

1353
01:39:41,184 --> 01:39:45,020
I have to be at work in 20 minutes.

1354
01:39:45,104 --> 01:39:48,148
What's up?

1355
01:39:48,232 --> 01:39:51,193
Well, I just—

1356
01:39:51,277 --> 01:39:54,404
I wanted to say
that you were right about everything.

1357
01:39:55,531 --> 01:39:57,658
That...

1358
01:39:57,742 --> 01:40:00,452
I turned my back on my friends
and my family...

1359
01:40:00,536 --> 01:40:02,496
and everything I believed in...

1360
01:40:02,580 --> 01:40:05,624
and— and for what?

1361
01:40:05,708 --> 01:40:10,629
For shoes and shirts
and jackets and belts.

1362
01:40:10,713 --> 01:40:12,881
Nate.

1363
01:40:16,219 --> 01:40:18,136
I'm sorry.

1364
01:40:26,229 --> 01:40:28,480
I—

1365
01:40:28,564 --> 01:40:30,732
I flew up to Boston while you were gone.

1366
01:40:30,817 --> 01:40:33,443
I interviewed at the Oak Room.

1367
01:40:33,528 --> 01:40:35,987
And?

1368
01:40:37,281 --> 01:40:40,033
And you're looking
at their new sous-chef.

1369
01:40:40,118 --> 01:40:43,995
- I'm moving up there in a couple weeks.
- That's great. Congratulations.

1370
01:40:49,419 --> 01:40:52,879
I don't know what I'm gonna do without
those late-night grilled cheeses, but—

1371
01:40:52,964 --> 01:40:57,050
I'm pretty sure
they have bread in Boston.

1372
01:40:57,135 --> 01:40:59,428
<i>May even have Jarlsberg.</i>

1373
01:41:02,598 --> 01:41:04,933
We might be able
to figure something out.

1374
01:41:07,061 --> 01:41:08,979
You think?

1375
01:41:09,063 --> 01:41:10,981
Yeah.

1376
01:41:17,864 --> 01:41:21,408
So, what about you?
I mean, what are you gonna do now?

1377
01:41:21,492 --> 01:41:24,870
Actually, I, uh—
I have a job interview today.

1378
01:41:24,954 --> 01:41:27,414
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

1379
01:41:27,498 --> 01:41:29,750
That's what you're wearing?

1380
01:41:29,834 --> 01:41:32,836
Shut up. I like this.

1381
01:41:36,924 --> 01:41:38,842
- Andy, Greg Hill.
- Hello.

1382
01:41:38,926 --> 01:41:41,344
Come on. These clips are excellent.

1383
01:41:41,429 --> 01:41:44,347
This thing on the janitors, union,
that's exactly what we do here.

1384
01:41:44,432 --> 01:41:47,434
<i>My only question is, Runway?</i>

1385
01:41:47,518 --> 01:41:50,145
You were there for less than a year.

1386
01:41:50,229 --> 01:41:52,230
What the hell kind of a blip is that?

1387
01:41:53,524 --> 01:41:55,525
Learned a lot.

1388
01:41:57,361 --> 01:42:02,407
In the end though,
I kind of screwed it up.

1389
01:42:02,492 --> 01:42:05,994
I called over there for a reference,
left word with some snooty girl.

1390
01:42:06,078 --> 01:42:09,664
<i>Next thing you know, I got a fax</i>
<i>from Miranda Priestly herself...</i>

1391
01:42:09,749 --> 01:42:12,292
saying that of all the assistants
she's ever had...

1392
01:42:12,376 --> 01:42:14,628
you were, by far,
her biggest disappointment.

1393
01:42:14,712 --> 01:42:19,925
<i>And, if I don't hire you,</i>
<i>I am an idiot.</i>

1394
01:42:22,428 --> 01:42:25,055
You must have done something right.

1395
01:42:57,046 --> 01:42:58,964
Miranda Priestly's office.

1396
01:42:59,048 --> 01:43:04,261
Hey, Emily, it's Andy. Don't hang up.
I have a favor to ask you.

1397
01:43:04,345 --> 01:43:07,138
You have a favor to ask of me?

1398
01:43:07,223 --> 01:43:10,517
Yeah. The thing is,
I have all these clothes from Paris...

1399
01:43:10,601 --> 01:43:12,644
and I don't have anyplace
to wear them...

1400
01:43:12,728 --> 01:43:16,898
so I was wondering if you
could take them off my hands.

1401
01:43:21,153 --> 01:43:25,198
Well, I don't know.
It's a huge imposition.

1402
01:43:25,283 --> 01:43:29,494
And I'll have to get them taken in.
I mean, they'll drown me.

1403
01:43:29,579 --> 01:43:34,040
But I suppose I could help you out.
I will have Roy pick them up this afternoon.

1404
01:43:34,125 --> 01:43:38,795
Thanks, Em. I appreciate it.
Good luck.

1405
01:43:48,639 --> 01:43:51,725
You have some very large shoes to fill.

1406
01:43:51,809 --> 01:43:55,312
I hope you know that.

1407
01:44:00,693 --> 01:44:04,195
I don't understand
why it is so challenging...

1408
01:44:04,280 --> 01:44:07,908
to get my car when I ask for it.

1409
01:44:53,245 --> 01:44:55,288
Go.
