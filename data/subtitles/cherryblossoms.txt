Cherry Blossoms

3
00:00:58,091 --> 00:01:00,616
I always wanted to
go to Japan with him.

4
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:04,595
Just to see Mt. Fuji once.
The cherry blossoms. With him.

5
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:09,365
Because seeing anything without
my husband, I can't even imagine that.

6
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:12,336
That would be like not really seeing it.

7
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:14,669
How can I go on living without him?

8
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:23,944
We wanted to talk it over
with you first.

9
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:27,952
If you think your husband
can cope with the diagnosis...

10
00:01:29,055 --> 00:01:30,955
people react differently...

11
00:01:31,057 --> 00:01:34,959
How the disease progresses
is hard to tell.

12
00:01:35,061 --> 00:01:37,222
It could be that your husband won't
even have any symptoms for a long time K

13
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:45,000
You might want to think about
doing something together...

14
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:46,766
a trip...

15
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:49,433
something a little adventurous...

16
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:03,712
My husband hates adventures.

17
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:10,854
He'd prefer it if
nothing changed. Ever.

18
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,455
Nothing. At all.

19
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:22,466
Every day he takes
the 7:28 train to Weilheim.

20
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,155
He used to work at the passport office.

21
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:49,133
Now he's the head of the
waste management department.

22
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:53,561
Recycling is good.
Reusables are better.

23
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,607
He's only been sick for one week
in twenty years. 1991.

24
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:58,609
The flu and an eardrum infection.

25
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:03,580
He eats the sandwich that I make for
him at 1 pm every day and his apple.

26
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:07,813
"An apple a day keeps the doctor away."
He says that every morning.

27
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:10,321
§An apple a day keeps the doctor away.

28
00:03:58,738 --> 00:03:59,534
Hello, Rudi.

29
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,370
How was your day?

30
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:06,843
So so...

31
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,378
Yours?

32
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:14,681
Okay.

33
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:41,178
Aren't you hungry?
- No.

34
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:47,946
Down more, Elke!

35
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:53,317
And with a smile, please!

36
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:58,026
Everything goes easier with a smile.

37
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,964
And peppy! And down!

38
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,623
Back already?

39
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:13,398
Karl Angermeier, leave messages
after the beep. Thanks.

40
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:15,940
Yes, Karl. This is Mama.

41
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:20,905
I... I wanted to... it's...

42
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:26,442
everything's okay. Talk to you soon.

43
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:55,041
Want to visit the children in Berlin?

44
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:57,275
Berlin? I don't know.

45
00:06:57,383 --> 00:06:59,476
What if we finally went to Japan?

46
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,487
You know...
Fuji's just another mountain.

47
00:07:04,857 --> 00:07:07,690
Yes, but we could visit Karl.

48
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:09,955
It'd be cheaper if he visited us.

49
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:11,858
Oh, Rudi!

50
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:17,795
Shall we go on?

51
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:20,565
I'm hungry.

52
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:16,428
Nothing to eat?

53
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:21,095
Rudi, we haven't been underway
for 5 minutes.

54
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:32,676
"An apple a day keeps the doctor away."

55
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:33,710
You want it?

56
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:35,075
No, not me.

57
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,614
I'll eat it later.

58
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:51,660
Imagine... the train stops in Hanau
for 2 minutes...

59
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:54,255
so if you don't get off fast...

60
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,550
He wanted to meet us on the platform!

61
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,554
What time is it? Look at your watch.

62
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:27,155
I'll give him 5 minutes and then

63
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:30,002
we'll take a taxi or something.

64
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:31,228
Hey!

65
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:32,960
Well...

66
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:35,938
Where were we?
- Where were you, Klaus?

67
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:36,974
Track 11...

68
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:39,476
That's where the train arrived.
- Track 11. We were there.

69
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:40,739
Klausi, hi. Klausi...
- Hi, Mama.

70
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:43,545
We waited for 20 minutes.

71
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:45,514
I waited for 20 minutes!

72
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:47,586
What?
- I'm fine.

73
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:49,279
Let me take it.
- No.

74
00:09:50,556 --> 00:09:51,887
Straight ahead.

75
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:56,423
Mama, the flower bed!

76
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:03,965
Mami, can't you watch out!

77
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,401
Hello, we're... oh!

78
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:07,269
Hi.

79
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,132
Hello, Emma.

80
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:10,037
Hallo.

81
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:19,042
Robert, Celine!

82
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:22,245
How about a kiss?

83
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:23,982
Robert!

84
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,820
Have a seat. We baked a cake.

85
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:27,824
Bought one.

86
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:36,964
Ah!
- Let them.

87
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:38,902
Thanks.

88
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:44,336
Gameboy or cake?
- Let them play.

89
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:48,977
Who'd like coffee?
- No coffee for me. A beer maybe.

90
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:50,914
Uh...

91
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:52,575
Then forget it.

92
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:53,515
Okay.

93
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:57,350
Forgive the intrusion. Mama had the
sudden urge to visit all of you.

94
00:10:57,456 --> 00:10:58,286
One after the other.

95
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:00,154
Karl too? That's great!

96
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:02,056
No, not Karl. Unfortunately.

97
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,026
Why not? That would be so nice.

98
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:07,258
Maybe next year. After I retire...

99
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:09,061
You'll have plenty of time.

100
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:32,224
You okay?

101
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:34,314
It just went down the wrong way.

102
00:11:37,663 --> 00:11:40,029
Need some water?
- No, I'm fine.

103
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:44,527
Hey, where have you been?
- Sorry! Hi.

104
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:48,803
Why did they decide to come,
out of the blue like this?

105
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:49,237
No idea.

106
00:11:49,341 --> 00:11:51,502
How long are they staying?
- They didn't say.

107
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:54,179
I have no time.

108
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,838
You think we do?

109
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:58,684
Hello!

110
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:03,248
Rudi, not now.

111
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:04,652
They have to go in the fridge.

112
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:07,692
Thanks, Pop. I've only been
a vegetarian for six years.

113
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:09,761
We'll take them. We love them.

114
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:12,456
But aren't they traditionally
supposed to be eaten before noon?

115
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,328
No, no, they have to
be eaten this evening.

116
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:18,199
Alright then, we'll have them tonight.

117
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:21,964
You poor thing, we're taking
your room away from you.

118
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:24,537
It's okay.

119
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:03,178
You don't like them, do you?

120
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,271
Not really.

121
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:07,316
Thanks.

122
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:09,717
So, more sausage.
- Thanks.

123
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:13,248
Want to go sightseeing tomorrow?

124
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:17,661
I'll drive you around a little, okay?

125
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:18,855
Show you the city.

126
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,022
Oh yes.

127
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:23,761
And then we'll visit you for coffee.
- Yeah. Great.

128
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:26,667
Mama wanted to see
some dance performance...

129
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:28,797
Oh, God, do we all have to go?

130
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:32,708
A famous Butoh dancer
from Japan is in town.

131
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,747
Butoh, what's that?
- A modern Japanese dance form...

132
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:37,213
Have another beer?

133
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,248
Bring me one too?

134
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,341
But I don't have to go.
- Sure you do.

135
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:43,012
Let's do something
we'd all like to do.

136
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:44,521
We'd love to go with you.

137
00:13:57,469 --> 00:13:59,960
Okay, Mama! Come on.

138
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:02,273
Please. "The Mayfly".

139
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:03,534
Go on, Mama.

140
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:07,608
Mama, Please recite it for us.

141
00:14:07,713 --> 00:14:10,978
Come on, Mama, please!

142
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:14,519
"Stop! What you're doing is murder

143
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,985
"Such cruelty is not a must

144
00:14:16,088 --> 00:14:18,318
"The mayfly has but one short day

145
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:19,448
"One single day of pain

146
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:21,651
One single day of lust."
- "One single day of lust"

147
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:28,363
"Oh, let it hover there.
Until it meets its end.

148
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:31,868
Its heaven lasts forever.
Its life one day to make amends."

149
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:33,199
Right, Mama?

150
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:36,941
Stop it!

151
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:45,139
Okay, it's set!
- Look at the birdy.

152
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:46,980
Come on.
- It's blinking.

153
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:48,815
Hurry!

154
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:51,683
Everybody smile.

155
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,781
Say 'ant shit'!

156
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:58,225
Papa, smile, too!
- I'm smiling already.

157
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:00,890
That doesn't matter.

158
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,695
Celine, don't you want to...
- She's not part of the family.

159
00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:06,327
Exactly.
- Take the sunglasses off!

160
00:15:07,506 --> 00:15:09,440
Come on! Okay, everybody.

161
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:10,530
Everybody look in the camera...

162
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:13,909
And now!

163
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:15,345
Yeahhh!

164
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,511
You're doing a great job.

165
00:15:23,622 --> 00:15:25,817
A little more.

166
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:29,122
You're good.

167
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:35,864
Where'd you learn that?

168
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:39,204
I don't know. From me.

169
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:40,829
From you!

170
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,073
But I can't anymore.

171
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:46,235
Thank you.

172
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:48,470
It was great.

173
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:56,319
What a massage.

174
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:59,357
See, now he feels great.

175
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:11,295
I forgot to offer your parents some.

176
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:12,631
Karl always sends them.

177
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:15,673
I don't touch mine.

178
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:19,467
I'd rather eat yours.
- How sweet!

179
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:22,475
They are good! Hmmn?

180
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,615
Oh, it just occurred to me.

181
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,585
I have a meeting all day tomorrow.

182
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:32,384
You're a pain!
- I don't believe it.

183
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:33,651
What'll we do with them?

184
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,455
All you politicians do
is sit on your butts!

185
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:37,688
You told them
you'd show them around!

186
00:16:37,796 --> 00:16:40,822
Sorry, but I just forgot!

187
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:42,298
I don't have time.

188
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:45,859
No way. I'm having them
for coffee and cake. That's plenty.

189
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:47,404
They're staying with us.

190
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,872
They're driving me nuts already.

191
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:51,237
Hey, they just arrived.

192
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:55,439
I hate myself for it
but they drive me crazy.

193
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:58,573
I go whacko in seconds.

194
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,652
Oh, God and I killed a fly.

195
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:02,687
That was bad.

196
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:07,782
Yes, I know. Thanks for your support,
dear. It was bad.

197
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:09,861
Yeah, "The Mayfly".

198
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:13,489
Right. And the only one of us
they're interested in is Karl.

199
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,361
Hmm?

200
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:17,731
I just said they're only
interested in Karl anyway.

201
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:21,294
That's always how it was.
- What I do doesn't interest them at all.

202
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,705
You think they care about what I do?

203
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:30,005
"Look at Karl! Isn't he cute!

204
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:35,883
Look at what he made and isn't it
nice the way he play...

205
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:38,320
Klaus, Leave Karl Alone! Go away!"

206
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:41,791
No. Remember?
"Karo! Klausi! Let Karli play...

207
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,362
Hi, sweetie!
- Hey.

208
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:49,900
What's the matter?
- I can't sleep!

209
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:53,737
I want to be in my room.

210
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:57,775
Yes, darling, I know.
They're not staying long.

211
00:17:57,876 --> 00:18:00,071
How long?

212
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:01,476
Forever!

213
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,009
Are you tired?

214
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:09,747
No, not really.
- Neither am I.

215
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:12,851
Well...

216
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:15,825
I'm glad they're all doing well.
- Yes.

217
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:19,719
Funny.

218
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:24,294
I can remember them
so well as children

219
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:29,334
but now I simply
don't know who they are.

220
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,602
Disappointed in them?

221
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:35,575
I just don't know them anymore.

222
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:38,444
Well, they're all healthy.

223
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,949
You can't expect too much.

224
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:24,161
HAPPY AT THE PARK

225
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:44,238
How long are they staying?
- No idea.

226
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:48,344
You have to look after them!

227
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:51,183
How? I don't have the time.

228
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:54,355
I like your parents.
I wish mine were like yours.

229
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:56,359
Sure, you don't know them well.

230
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:03,361
We could get them tickets for
the show in the Friedrichstadtpalast.

231
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:06,798
My mother hates revues.

232
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:13,074
She's really gotten old.

233
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:16,144
Wow.

234
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,018
Yeah, strange how people change.

235
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:23,887
I wonder what we'll be like.

236
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:26,919
No idea.

237
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:30,525
We just won't get old.

238
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:33,787
What are they doing today?

239
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:38,302
I can't.

240
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:42,429
What the hell are we
going to do with them?

241
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,272
No, no, no

242
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:49,006
Please.

243
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:54,217
So now you're going to meow or what?

244
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:55,013
Please...

245
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,281
No. I have to go to the upholsterer.
I don't have time.

246
00:20:57,389 --> 00:20:58,321
I don't either.

247
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,220
No, really, I have too much to do.

248
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:06,059
No! No.
- Please. Please.

249
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:11,996
No. No.
- Please.

250
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:13,696
Please.

251
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:23,780
So...

252
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,912
Come on. She's here.

253
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:34,286
So now I'll show you our old apartment.
Karo and I lived up there.

254
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:40,855
Right over the bar.
Very practical. And a disaster.

255
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:43,992
But it wasn't renovated then.
We heated with coal.

256
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:49,230
Oh, man, okay! Alright already!

257
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:52,434
Sorry! Yeah,
and fuck you, too, asshole!

258
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:01,785
To your left
the golden dome of the synagogue.

259
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:06,517
And straight ahead
our beautiful TV tower. Look!

260
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:41,953
Wow, that must have cost.
What a cake!

261
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,358
We never bought cake at home,
did we, Mama?

262
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,499
Thanks for today, Franzi.

263
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,125
We saw a lot of the city. Thanks.

264
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,702
Thanks!

265
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:03,843
Did you have a nice time?
- Very nice, yes.

266
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:07,609
This is good beer.
I hardly ever drink beer anymore.

267
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:08,913
Thank goodness.

268
00:23:11,423 --> 00:23:13,448
And Karl? Does he still drink?

269
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:15,219
How should I know?

270
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:18,590
Karl never drank very much.

271
00:23:20,265 --> 00:23:22,893
Oh, yes he did.
Like a fish for a while.

272
00:23:23,001 --> 00:23:26,698
That's absolutely not true.
- Nonsense!

273
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:28,864
Does Karli have a girlfriend in Tokyo?

274
00:23:29,274 --> 00:23:31,538
Mama, you call him all the time.
Ask him next time:

275
00:23:31,643 --> 00:23:34,578
"So Karli, how's it going?
Still boozing and what about chicks?"

276
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:37,505
So, what'll we do now?

277
00:23:38,383 --> 00:23:39,941
What would you like to?

278
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,922
You're both probably tired
and want to go straight to bed.

279
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:54,798
It's not even six?

280
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,162
We could cook something.

281
00:23:57,903 --> 00:24:00,167
No, Franzi, you've done enough.

282
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:05,035
Let's go, Rudi.

283
00:24:13,685 --> 00:24:16,313
Want us to drive you home?

284
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:17,353
No.

285
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:20,284
Franzi!

286
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:22,690
Let us take the S-Bahn...

287
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:28,755
a little big city flair
for us country bumpkins...

288
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:30,027
Take care.

289
00:24:32,337 --> 00:24:33,736
Come here.

290
00:24:37,008 --> 00:24:37,975
See you tomorrow.

291
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:40,104
Tomorrow?

292
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:42,180
We have a date.
- Aha.

293
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:46,714
Papa!

294
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:48,847
So long!
- Bye!

295
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:55,585
Bye, Mama.

296
00:25:16,214 --> 00:25:17,146
Are you coming?

297
00:25:18,149 --> 00:25:19,343
Let's have some wine.

298
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:21,442
Let's drink something. Come on.

299
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:27,087
I'm awful...
- No!

300
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:29,786
Where do we have to go? Herrmannsdorf?

301
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:31,055
What?

302
00:25:31,162 --> 00:25:33,858
Berlin Center. Where is it?
Has to be in the center somewhere.

303
00:25:33,965 --> 00:25:35,557
Give me some change.

304
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:36,634
How much?

305
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:40,068
The train's leaving! You'd know it!

306
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:41,905
It won't go in.
- Try it again...

307
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:44,472
It won't take it. How am I
supposed to buy a ticket?

308
00:25:44,576 --> 00:25:45,634
Try this...

309
00:25:46,978 --> 00:25:49,469
It won't go in. It doesn't work.

310
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:51,674
That's Berlin for you.
- Rudi, I think you need paper money.

311
00:25:51,783 --> 00:25:55,241
They're out of their minds.
A machine and no tickets come out.

312
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:04,321
Wait... Berlin AB, just what I said.

313
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:05,225
What now?

314
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:08,265
We need one more.

315
00:26:08,366 --> 00:26:10,561
So now we have one ticket
for either you or me or what?

316
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:14,662
Read what it says "Two people
can't use one ticket." Look here!

317
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:17,936
You can't even pay here.

318
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:22,104
Am I supposed to walk? Or you?
Or one of us doesn't pay or what?

319
00:26:22,213 --> 00:26:24,113
Rudi, don't get so excited.

320
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:26,679
I'm not excited. I'm furious.

321
00:26:39,731 --> 00:26:41,130
I think I want to go home.

322
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:43,298
Oh, Rudi...

323
00:26:43,401 --> 00:26:45,062
The kids don't have any time for us.

324
00:26:50,241 --> 00:26:52,835
The Baltic isn't far.
- Hmm?

325
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:57,009
When was the last time
we were at the beach?

326
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:58,275
At the beach?

327
00:26:58,383 --> 00:27:00,248
I can't remember either.

328
00:27:00,352 --> 00:27:03,082
1987? With the kids?

329
00:27:03,188 --> 00:27:04,780
Or was that Lake Garda?

330
00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:08,315
You want to go to the beach?

331
00:27:09,194 --> 00:27:11,321
Yes, would you?

332
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:15,525
If you want to.
- But what do you want?

333
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:18,328
I always do whatever you say...

334
00:31:38,596 --> 00:31:40,962
The beach isn't what
it used to be, either.

335
00:31:42,767 --> 00:31:46,168
You old grouch. Aren't you cold?

336
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:47,431
You know what?

337
00:31:47,538 --> 00:31:48,732
Slip in there.

338
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,673
What?
- It's warm. Go on.

339
00:31:51,776 --> 00:31:55,177
Tomorrow we'll get up early
and take a long walk on the beach.

340
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,475
What? You want to take a walk?

341
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,015
Wonderful!

342
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:04,211
I'd like my ashes to
be scattered at sea.

343
00:32:06,891 --> 00:32:08,290
What makes you say that?

344
00:32:08,393 --> 00:32:10,827
Nothing. Don't you ever
think about that?

345
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:14,589
Really? Well, I do every now and then.
How much time we have left...

346
00:32:16,734 --> 00:32:17,598
Rudi...

347
00:32:17,702 --> 00:32:20,466
You're right.
One ought not think about it...

348
00:32:21,472 --> 00:32:22,996
We've been lucky so far.

349
00:32:25,209 --> 00:32:30,146
Assuming we didn't have much time
left, what would you like to do?

350
00:32:31,215 --> 00:32:32,944
Ah, that line: live every day
as if it were your last.

351
00:32:33,051 --> 00:32:34,951
What nonsense.
What else should you do?

352
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:38,386
Let me tell you: I wouldn't
do anything differently. Nothing.

353
00:32:38,489 --> 00:32:40,923
I'd go to work in the morning
and come home to you in the evening.

354
00:32:41,025 --> 00:32:42,959
That's what I'd do.

355
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:44,221
Yes.

356
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:58,108
Can't you sleep?

357
00:32:58,209 --> 00:33:00,336
The surf is so loud.

358
00:33:10,254 --> 00:33:13,189
And now that.
- Come on, Rudi!

359
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:16,858
It's nice.

360
00:33:26,437 --> 00:33:29,065
You are and always will be loony.

361
00:33:30,308 --> 00:33:31,639
Oh, come on!

362
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:33,074
What on earth are you doing?

363
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:34,701
Come on. You can't sleep anyway.

364
00:33:34,812 --> 00:33:36,575
Cut it out!

365
00:33:37,648 --> 00:33:40,515
Dancing in the middle of the night?
Other people are asleep.

366
00:34:52,056 --> 00:34:55,184
What's with you?
- Nothing. Nothing at all.

367
00:35:30,061 --> 00:35:32,052
What's wrong? Have you had enough?

368
00:35:32,163 --> 00:35:33,687
Didn't you sleep well?

369
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:37,762
I didn't but you did.
- Me? Not one second.

370
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:39,928
You slept like a log.

371
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:45,070
Let's go home.

372
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:46,939
We've seen Berlin,
we've seen the Baltic,

373
00:35:47,044 --> 00:35:48,978
and we've seen the children.
Let's go home.

374
00:35:50,214 --> 00:35:52,808
I thought you'd be glad to
see your children.

375
00:35:54,285 --> 00:35:56,276
I don't know them. They don't know me.

376
00:35:58,689 --> 00:36:01,089
Our children are better than most.

377
00:36:01,192 --> 00:36:02,955
Yes, we're fortunate.

378
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:06,225
We have each other.
That's real happiness.

379
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:19,408
What is it?

380
00:36:20,711 --> 00:36:21,507
Nothing.

381
00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:23,980
I just didn't get
a good night's sleep.

382
00:36:24,081 --> 00:36:26,345
Whenever I woke up
you were sound asleep.

383
00:37:41,492 --> 00:37:45,394
How calm the sea is.

384
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:49,329
As if was always that way.

385
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:51,594
It's time to rise and shine!
Come on! Get up you lazybones!

386
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:55,367
Trudi...

387
00:38:00,177 --> 00:38:02,372
Trudi...

388
00:38:35,413 --> 00:38:37,779
Papa, Karl's here.

389
00:38:39,917 --> 00:38:42,351
The sea is so calm.

390
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:53,459
Come on.

391
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,752
I can't stand her lying
in that box in there.

392
00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:55,224
I haven't seen her for so long
and now I'll never see her again.

393
00:39:56,494 --> 00:40:00,658
I should've visited her.
Or at least flown her to Tokyo.

394
00:40:00,765 --> 00:40:03,165
I never did anything for her.

395
00:40:04,368 --> 00:40:06,097
And now there's nothing I can do.

396
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:10,539
We have to look after Papa now.

397
00:40:11,108 --> 00:40:13,702
And how am I supposed to do that?
- I understand.

398
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:16,629
We never went to the beach
when we were kids.

399
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:17,968
No, always to the mountains, right?

400
00:41:18,075 --> 00:41:19,269
We were in Italy once.

401
00:41:19,376 --> 00:41:20,866
But not at the beach.
- Lake Garda.

402
00:41:21,612 --> 00:41:22,874
Grosglockner. We took the Grosglockner
pass over the Alps, right, Papa?

403
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,607
Yeah. We all got carsick

404
00:41:24,715 --> 00:41:27,240
but Mama had a plastic bag
for each of us.

405
00:41:27,351 --> 00:41:29,216
She was so full of life back then.

406
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:32,649
How old was she?

407
00:41:32,756 --> 00:41:34,587
A little older than we are now.

408
00:41:34,692 --> 00:41:38,287
She devoted almost her
entire life to you kids and me.

409
00:41:39,096 --> 00:41:40,859
She wouldn't have put it that way.

410
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:44,734
Want me to go with you?

411
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:50,770
It's just not right. It's not fair.
She can't just leave him alone with us.

412
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:52,934
I don't think she planned it like that.
- Yes, I know.

413
00:41:53,043 --> 00:41:55,238
Mama would've been able to
get along... No problem there.

414
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:58,509
But him? What are we
supposed to do with him?

415
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:02,278
When are you flying back?

416
00:42:02,386 --> 00:42:05,048
I can't stay long. My flight leaves
tomorrow afternoon from Berlin.

417
00:42:05,155 --> 00:42:06,383
We have to get back, too.

418
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:08,185
So do we.
The kids are at the neighbors.

419
00:42:08,292 --> 00:42:09,520
Who has the bag?

420
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:10,457
What bag?

421
00:42:10,561 --> 00:42:12,461
The bag with her things. I'd like to
have the kimono if you all don't mind.

422
00:42:12,563 --> 00:42:13,461
She always used to
have it on in the kitchen. No.

423
00:42:13,564 --> 00:42:14,428
Yes.

424
00:42:15,065 --> 00:42:17,260
It's all over. And it's impossible
to even imagine beforehand.

425
00:42:31,315 --> 00:42:34,079
If I had known
it would end so suddenly,

426
00:42:37,021 --> 00:42:40,457
I would have been nicer to her.

427
00:42:41,926 --> 00:42:45,521
Papa, nobody can know that.

428
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:49,222
Thanks for us to be able to
sit here like this.

429
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:51,927
She would have been
very happy you came, Karl.

430
00:42:54,338 --> 00:42:56,033
What are you going to do now?

431
00:42:58,142 --> 00:43:00,076
I'll have to get used to it.

432
00:43:00,177 --> 00:43:01,872
Don't worry about me.

433
00:43:07,217 --> 00:43:08,206
Thanks.

434
00:43:10,154 --> 00:43:11,621
Emma, give me a little more wine.

435
00:43:12,456 --> 00:43:13,889
Excuse me.

436
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:35,558
My condolences.
- Thank you.

437
00:45:35,666 --> 00:45:37,634
And this must be Karolin.

438
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:42,001
No, no, Karolin is in Berlin.
And our youngest is in Japan.

439
00:45:42,106 --> 00:45:43,971
Ah, yes. And Klaus? Where is Klaus?

440
00:45:44,675 --> 00:45:46,905
He has a very important meeting.
- I see.

441
00:45:47,478 --> 00:45:49,503
My condolences.

442
00:45:49,613 --> 00:45:53,242
My condolences. My condolences.

443
00:45:53,884 --> 00:45:57,547
The dance performance was
what she enjoyed most in Berlin.

444
00:45:57,654 --> 00:45:59,554
She said she'd never met
a nicer girl than you.

445
00:45:59,656 --> 00:46:03,092
I'm not that nice. I don't know
why she thought that of me.

446
00:46:03,193 --> 00:46:05,753
She told me about how
she always wanted to dance,

447
00:46:06,964 --> 00:46:10,092
to become a really good Butoh dancer,
more than anything else in her life...

448
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:14,000
and how she would've liked to
go to Japan so much to study it there

449
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:18,336
and how everything
turned out differently

450
00:46:18,842 --> 00:46:21,276
and that it was a good life but...
Not that you think that she wasn't happy.

451
00:46:21,378 --> 00:46:25,246
No... I thought...
maybe there's another woman in her...

452
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:28,375
that nobody saw...

453
00:46:28,485 --> 00:46:31,215
and I saw that other person...
that's all...

454
00:46:58,182 --> 00:46:59,149
That's her?

455
00:47:01,218 --> 00:47:06,588
I didn't like it.
It was so... so extreme.

456
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:10,751
It embarrassed me...
I didn't want her to keep it up...

457
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:14,357
We locked her up in here.

458
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:17,099
But she was happy here.

459
00:47:17,801 --> 00:47:18,790
For sure.

460
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:21,531
I don't know.

461
00:47:26,443 --> 00:47:27,341
Goodbye.

462
00:47:39,223 --> 00:47:41,020
All the best.
- Thanks.

463
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:43,216
Have a good trip!
- Okay!

464
00:48:34,645 --> 00:48:37,637
One hundred Views of Mt. Fuji.

465
00:49:10,013 --> 00:49:12,811
Trudi, where are you?

466
00:49:15,052 --> 00:49:16,519
Where?

467
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:00,861
Papa.
- Ah!

468
00:50:00,964 --> 00:50:03,296
I thought you'd forgotten me. Hi.

469
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:06,164
I couldn't get away earlier.

470
00:50:06,269 --> 00:50:08,362
How are you? Was the flight okay?
- Fine.

471
00:50:33,263 --> 00:50:34,321
Papa, come on.

472
00:51:02,659 --> 00:51:04,354
You have to take your shoes off.

473
00:51:05,162 --> 00:51:08,359
Oh, yes.

474
00:51:11,168 --> 00:51:12,066
Wait...

475
00:51:18,875 --> 00:51:19,569
There.

476
00:51:19,676 --> 00:51:21,576
I brought my own.
- Okay.

477
00:51:36,526 --> 00:51:37,993
It's not exactly big.

478
00:51:38,829 --> 00:51:39,853
No.

479
00:51:48,405 --> 00:51:49,497
Want something to drink?

480
00:52:02,352 --> 00:52:04,445
Mama always sent you this.

481
00:52:04,554 --> 00:52:08,615
You can't get bread like this
in Japan and the sausages.

482
00:52:08,725 --> 00:52:14,220
And these, two flavors.

483
00:52:14,331 --> 00:52:15,593
Papa, I have to get back to the office.

484
00:52:15,699 --> 00:52:17,860
What exactly do you do?

485
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:19,902
I've never quite understood...

486
00:52:20,003 --> 00:52:23,996
Nice of you to ask after five years.
I crunch numbers.

487
00:52:24,107 --> 00:52:25,836
What you do with garbage fees.
I do pretty much the same thing as you.

488
00:52:32,382 --> 00:52:36,910
Look... Radio, air conditioner,
satellite receiver, TV.

489
00:52:37,721 --> 00:52:39,154
See you this evening, okay?

490
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:42,583
I'll be back around six.

491
00:53:38,014 --> 00:53:41,472
My dear Karl,
here's the second stanza:

492
00:53:41,585 --> 00:53:46,284
Oh, let it hover there
until it meets its end

493
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:52,624
Its heaven lasts forever
It's life one day to make amends

494
00:54:51,821 --> 00:54:54,517
Want something else?
- No, it's fine.

495
00:54:55,992 --> 00:54:58,859
We'll think something out for you
tomorrow. I have to go out later tonight.

496
00:55:01,197 --> 00:55:01,754
Okay.

497
00:55:01,865 --> 00:55:06,700
I'm sorry that I have such little time
but I didn't have much warning.

498
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:10,170
I don't want to get on your nerves.
- Come on, don't even say that.

499
00:55:15,378 --> 00:55:18,279
Why didn't the two of you
ever visit me?

500
00:55:23,586 --> 00:55:25,577
We thought we had time.

501
00:55:28,091 --> 00:55:34,428
I think I kept your mother from
what was most important to her.

502
00:55:37,067 --> 00:55:38,967
You can't do things for the dead.

503
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:41,394
Papa...

504
00:57:01,017 --> 00:57:04,578
Look, here's some yen.
I'll pick you up later.

505
00:57:04,687 --> 00:57:07,588
Don't move from here.
I don't want you to get lost. Look,

506
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:10,718
I work over there.
- Which building?

507
00:57:10,827 --> 00:57:13,261
Next to the black one.
So, I'll pick you up later. Bye.

508
00:57:29,312 --> 00:57:31,712
Uh... beer.

509
00:57:49,065 --> 00:57:49,793
Thank you.

510
00:58:24,567 --> 00:58:26,501
Ahungu what?

511
01:00:45,608 --> 01:00:48,600
Nein, I'm, I'm not understand.

512
01:00:53,282 --> 01:00:54,772
Oh, no, es ist, it's good, it's good.

513
01:02:07,490 --> 01:02:10,288
Hey! Where were you? Are you crazy?

514
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:13,794
I was so worried.
I thought I'd lost you for good.

515
01:02:13,896 --> 01:02:15,625
Unbelievable!

516
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:18,257
The doorbells, I couldn't read them.

517
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:19,732
Who told you to go anywhere?

518
01:02:19,836 --> 01:02:21,201
You can't read anything here.

519
01:02:21,304 --> 01:02:22,532
I told you to stay put.
- I don't understand anything.

520
01:02:22,638 --> 01:02:23,229
I told you to stay where you were.

521
01:02:23,339 --> 01:02:25,170
Do you have any idea
how big this city is?

522
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:27,300
How easy it is to get lost?

523
01:04:50,623 --> 01:04:52,682
Hi, Papa.
- Hello.

524
01:04:53,726 --> 01:04:56,422
How was your day?
- So so.

525
01:05:00,533 --> 01:05:02,296
Didn't you go out?
- No.

526
01:05:08,941 --> 01:05:10,431
Know how my cell works?

527
01:05:12,612 --> 01:05:13,544
Look,

528
01:05:15,381 --> 01:05:17,815
here. Just one button.

529
01:05:17,917 --> 01:05:20,750
I saw it. It has a picture of you.
- Right.

530
01:05:20,853 --> 01:05:22,411
Look, that's my phone number.

531
01:05:26,058 --> 01:05:27,923
Did you eat anything?
- Yes.

532
01:05:29,762 --> 01:05:31,161
No, you didn't.

533
01:05:34,433 --> 01:05:36,264
I don't understand where Trudi is.

534
01:05:37,670 --> 01:05:39,297
Where her body is.

535
01:05:42,508 --> 01:05:44,874
My memories of her are in my body,

536
01:05:44,977 --> 01:05:47,104
but when my body's no longer here,
where will Trudi be then?

537
01:05:47,213 --> 01:05:52,241
Papa... Papa,
I'm grieving for Mama, too...

538
01:05:52,351 --> 01:05:54,148
but... really...

539
01:05:54,253 --> 01:05:58,656
Don't tell me life goes on. Please.

540
01:06:13,172 --> 01:06:14,366
Come on, now!

541
01:06:17,843 --> 01:06:20,311
You know, this is Bavarian Style.

542
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:22,872
This is Bavarian Style.

543
01:06:31,590 --> 01:06:36,493
Cherry blossoms... The most beautiful
symbol for impermanence...

544
01:06:36,595 --> 01:06:39,530
They're only here for a few days.

545
01:06:39,632 --> 01:06:41,600
And then they're gone.

546
01:06:41,701 --> 01:06:43,896
That's it.

547
01:06:58,317 --> 01:07:00,808
Papa, that's my Papa!

548
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:02,217
Nice, huh, Papa!

549
01:07:04,490 --> 01:07:09,018
Kampai, kampai, kampai!

550
01:07:21,307 --> 01:07:23,434
Don't treat me like a child!

551
01:07:23,542 --> 01:07:25,373
It's bedtime.

552
01:07:26,645 --> 01:07:30,206
This will be the first time
you've ever put me to bed.

553
01:07:30,316 --> 01:07:32,375
You of all people! Hilarious!

554
01:07:32,485 --> 01:07:34,976
How can anyone get so loaded?

555
01:07:35,087 --> 01:07:37,317
Everyone always has to look after you.
- Come on now.

556
01:07:37,423 --> 01:07:40,654
You always have to be
the center of attention.

557
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:42,091
Give me your arm!

558
01:07:42,194 --> 01:07:43,957
Be considerate of your father!
Your poor father!

559
01:07:44,063 --> 01:07:46,224
Leave your father alone! He's tired!

560
01:07:46,332 --> 01:07:51,702
He works so hard!
Works his ass off in the office!

561
01:07:51,804 --> 01:07:52,668
So, that's enough.

562
01:07:52,772 --> 01:07:54,501
You spent your entire life
hiding in your office!

563
01:07:54,607 --> 01:07:56,336
You never even really knew Mama!

564
01:07:56,442 --> 01:07:59,878
You have no idea who she was!

565
01:07:59,979 --> 01:08:03,415
No idea, you old fool, you.

566
01:08:04,950 --> 01:08:05,939
Get out!

567
01:08:06,051 --> 01:08:09,418
Go back to your garbage trucks,
that's where you belong.

568
01:08:09,522 --> 01:08:11,319
And don't forget to recycle!

569
01:08:13,259 --> 01:08:16,717
"An Apple a day, keeps a doctor away."

570
01:08:28,274 --> 01:08:29,263
So... So.

571
01:08:36,015 --> 01:08:37,175
So, I have to go.

572
01:08:38,083 --> 01:08:40,142
Wait... Here.

573
01:08:53,132 --> 01:08:54,224
Oh, Papa.

574
01:08:56,402 --> 01:08:59,667
Stop. Your apple.

575
01:08:59,772 --> 01:09:02,536
"An apple a day, keeps the doctor away."
...keeps the doctor away.

576
01:09:02,641 --> 01:09:03,630
Bye.

577
01:09:04,210 --> 01:09:05,142
So long.

578
01:09:07,813 --> 01:09:09,610
What is this?

579
01:09:10,950 --> 01:09:12,383
Metal.

580
01:09:12,485 --> 01:09:18,720
Plastic. Plastic. Metal. Metal.

581
01:09:18,824 --> 01:09:21,224
Paper. Paper.

582
01:09:22,305 --> 01:09:28,539
Better than Tinder on
