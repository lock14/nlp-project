1
00:01:48,695 --> 00:01:51,944
With over a million casualties
from the Battle of Verdun alone,

2
00:01:51,994 --> 00:01:54,409
the death toll continues to climb.

3
00:01:56,494 --> 00:01:59,330
Never before has the battlefield been so vast

4
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:02,751
and never before has the fighting
been so gruesome.

5
00:02:03,293 --> 00:02:05,670
Whether on the ground in brutal trench warfare

6
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:08,211
or high, high in the skies above them,

7
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:12,594
millions of young soldiers continue to die
with no end in sight.

8
00:02:14,012 --> 00:02:17,891
It seems as though the German aggressors
cannot be stopped as the Allied nations

9
00:02:17,891 --> 00:02:20,101
valiantly fight to survive.

10
00:02:21,227 --> 00:02:23,730
The Great War rages on.

11
00:02:29,777 --> 00:02:31,446
Hello, Blaine.

12
00:02:31,446 --> 00:02:34,157
You're not gonna give me any problems,
are you?

13
00:02:34,782 --> 00:02:38,202
Got no quarrel with you. Just that banker.

14
00:02:38,953 --> 00:02:43,124
You broke up Sandford's face pretty good.
He's looking to see you in jail.

15
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:45,126
He had it coming.

16
00:02:46,794 --> 00:02:49,046
I got a bench warrant for your arrest.

17
00:02:49,046 --> 00:02:51,883
I'm gonna give you half an hour
before I serve it.

18
00:02:51,883 --> 00:02:56,137
If I were you, I'd get out of town.
Way out of town.

19
00:02:56,804 --> 00:03:00,471
Fear continues to grow that
without the United States' intervention,

20
00:03:00,521 --> 00:03:02,310
France could soon fall.

21
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:05,146
Despite President Wilson's refusal
to enter the conflict,

22
00:03:05,146 --> 00:03:09,817
some determined young Americans
have volunteered to join the fray anyway.

23
00:03:09,817 --> 00:03:12,111
Using the latest in flying war machines,

24
00:03:12,111 --> 00:03:16,699
the French have created a new
airborne combat unit just for these Yanks.

25
00:03:19,201 --> 00:03:22,246
From all over,
American boys are making their way

26
00:03:22,246 --> 00:03:26,083
across the Atlantic to learn how to fly.

27
00:03:35,593 --> 00:03:36,844
Good luck, son.

28
00:03:36,844 --> 00:03:39,430
I'll try to bring home a couple of medals
like you and Grandpa.

29
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,307
We'll march together in the 4th of July parade,

30
00:03:41,307 --> 00:03:42,766
you'll see.

31
00:03:44,351 --> 00:03:47,021
Don't worry, Mom. I got the Jensen blood.

32
00:03:47,146 --> 00:03:50,691
Haven't made the bullet yet
that's stronger than that.

33
00:03:54,236 --> 00:03:58,407
I'm gonna miss you so much.
Write me every day, okay?

34
00:03:59,116 --> 00:04:00,701
All aboard!

35
00:04:02,995 --> 00:04:04,246
I will.

36
00:04:15,924 --> 00:04:18,969
I'll be fine. Don't worry.

37
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,888
I love you, Laura.

38
00:05:21,406 --> 00:05:23,908
I'm gonna learn to fly airplanes.

39
00:05:27,453 --> 00:05:28,913
Come on, now.

40
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,046
Thank you so much.

41
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:39,340
- Please take great care of them.
- Yes, sir.

42
00:05:41,926 --> 00:05:45,888
Well, you should have everything you need.

43
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:47,682
Thank you, Father.

44
00:05:47,807 --> 00:05:51,056
I've made arrangements
to come to Paris in the fall.

45
00:05:51,106 --> 00:05:54,147
- I may come and see you then.
- Yes, Father.

46
00:05:54,981 --> 00:05:56,732
Buck up, my boy.

47
00:05:57,275 --> 00:05:59,986
This noble conflict you're about to enter

48
00:05:59,986 --> 00:06:03,739
is the kind of adventure
that can set one above the herd.

49
00:06:04,073 --> 00:06:05,074
I suppose so.

50
00:06:05,074 --> 00:06:08,661
Damn it, Briggs, have you no enthusiasm
for anything that might distinguish you?

51
00:06:08,661 --> 00:06:10,746
It's quite enough
you've been dismissed from Harvard,

52
00:06:10,746 --> 00:06:16,602
but your continuing lack of direction
has become an embarrassment.

53
00:06:16,652 --> 00:06:19,672
It's time to do something worthy of your name.

54
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:23,259
Have you nothing to say?

55
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,845
No, Father.

56
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:02,148
They said we're supposed to go
to a place on 228 Rue Brion.

57
00:07:02,198 --> 00:07:03,799
That's where we can buy
all our aviator clothes.

58
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:05,884
I can't understand a word on this map.

59
00:07:05,968 --> 00:07:08,925
Hello? Does anybody here speak English?

60
00:07:10,806 --> 00:07:12,057
Okay.

61
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:15,143
Brion. Rue Brion.

62
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,988
Right there. Yeah.

63
00:07:26,405 --> 00:07:27,990
Rue Brion. Do you see it?

64
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:30,575
Excuse me, sir? We're a little lost, and...

65
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:34,329
Never mind.

66
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:38,625
Oh, good Lord.

67
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:25,964
On your right,
you've got the English squadron.

68
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:29,547
They fly the Bristol, the Sopwith
and the SE5As.

69
00:08:29,597 --> 00:08:31,594
- This place is really something.
- Have you ever seen anything...

70
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:34,097
And here is the French detachment.

71
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:37,016
They fly Nieuport 11s.

72
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:10,675
How many of you speak French?

73
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:26,107
Our country has been at war since
we were first attacked three years ago,

74
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:29,860
and we have lost more than a million
of our young men.

75
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:34,698
Your country turned its back on this conflict,

76
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:40,538
but you have bravely volunteered
to join the fight to preserve freedom.

77
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:45,834
All right, there is not much more to see,
so let's have eyes forward.

78
00:09:48,545 --> 00:09:50,839
We do not expect you to win the war,

79
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:55,135
only to do what your conscience
commands and your courage allows.

80
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:59,473
You will train for two months,
then we'll see which one of you

81
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:02,848
becomes your squadron's first ace.

82
00:10:02,898 --> 00:10:04,395
That'll be me.

83
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:11,819
- Who are you?
- Blaine Rawlings.

84
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:14,488
We arrive in uniform, Mr. Rawlings.

85
00:10:15,322 --> 00:10:19,239
Yeah, I wasn't quite sure
how it all went together.

86
00:10:20,577 --> 00:10:21,912
I see.

87
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:24,498
So these are the new corpses, huh?

88
00:10:25,874 --> 00:10:27,334
What's this?

89
00:10:27,334 --> 00:10:29,544
We got cowpunchers coming over now?

90
00:10:29,628 --> 00:10:31,171
Yeah, I done some cowboying.

91
00:10:31,171 --> 00:10:33,382
You think a six-shooter's
gonna help you up there?

92
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:37,427
Well, whatever you were using
didn't seem to do you much good.

93
00:10:38,178 --> 00:10:39,846
He's funny.

94
00:10:39,846 --> 00:10:42,265
I may even come to his funeral.

95
00:10:43,266 --> 00:10:47,371
The Captain bother to tell you
the life expectancy for pilots around here?

96
00:10:47,421 --> 00:10:49,231
It's three to six weeks.

97
00:10:50,273 --> 00:10:55,070
Let me guess, you're here because
you thought it'd be fun to fly airplanes.

98
00:10:57,989 --> 00:11:00,200
Go home while you still can.

99
00:11:01,618 --> 00:11:04,537
Guy sure knows how to make friends.

100
00:11:04,663 --> 00:11:06,748
All his friends are dead.

101
00:11:21,346 --> 00:11:22,806
We're here.

102
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,225
There we are.

103
00:11:29,145 --> 00:11:31,147
This is your quarters.

104
00:11:32,732 --> 00:11:36,236
Soon others from your country
will stay here as well.

105
00:11:38,571 --> 00:11:41,157
I've never seen anything like this
back home. Have you?

106
00:11:41,157 --> 00:11:43,326
As a matter of fact, I have.

107
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:46,996
Beats the hell out of the infantry.

108
00:11:47,914 --> 00:11:49,916
Frenchies sure put on a nice war.

109
00:11:59,425 --> 00:12:01,677
- Home sweet home.
- My, oh, my.

110
00:12:09,101 --> 00:12:11,938
- Careful, you oaf!
- Hey, I'm sorry.

111
00:12:12,438 --> 00:12:16,730
That's a 100-year-old bottle of cognac.
It's worth more than you are.

112
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:17,860
Nice.

113
00:12:17,944 --> 00:12:21,948
Your benefactor, William K. Vanderbilt,
has rented this château for you.

114
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,868
- Oh, my God.
- Rawlings, look out!

115
00:12:27,119 --> 00:12:30,164
Somebody help.
Get this... Get. Get.

116
00:12:31,123 --> 00:12:34,877
- Get.
- Whiskey. Come on, get off him.

117
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:40,299
What's the matter there, cowboy?
Having a little trouble with the dogie?

118
00:12:41,842 --> 00:12:44,762
Whiskey is our squadron mascot.
Follow me.

119
00:12:46,847 --> 00:12:48,724
Who keeps a lion as a pet?

120
00:12:48,724 --> 00:12:51,852
Start over there.
I'll give you your room assignments.

121
00:12:53,729 --> 00:12:54,980
Jensen and Toddman.

122
00:12:55,064 --> 00:12:56,148
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

123
00:12:56,148 --> 00:12:57,066
Room one.

124
00:12:57,149 --> 00:12:59,777
Skinner and Lowry, room number three.

125
00:12:59,777 --> 00:13:03,113
- Excuse me. Skinner and I?
- Is there a problem?

126
00:13:07,493 --> 00:13:12,289
It would be like sharing a room
with one of my servants back home.

127
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:17,711
Lowry, we'll put you in two with Beagle.

128
00:13:18,128 --> 00:13:21,673
Rawlings, you'll go in three with Skinner.

129
00:13:22,299 --> 00:13:26,595
If there are any further objections,
please take them up with Whiskey.

130
00:13:26,595 --> 00:13:27,596
Okay.

131
00:13:27,596 --> 00:13:29,806
I'll see you all at training
tomorrow morning at 6:30.

132
00:13:29,806 --> 00:13:31,350
Excuse me, sir?

133
00:13:31,475 --> 00:13:34,269
- Who rooms with the lion tamer?
- Cassidy?

134
00:13:34,269 --> 00:13:35,771
He has 20 kills.

135
00:13:35,771 --> 00:13:36,772
Twenty...

136
00:13:37,314 --> 00:13:39,399
He gets a room on his own.

137
00:13:46,698 --> 00:13:48,450
Let's get it over with.

138
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:51,825
You got any objection to rooming
with a colored man?

139
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:54,831
I don't know, you're the first one
I ever seen up close.

140
00:13:54,831 --> 00:13:56,708
What have you heard?

141
00:13:57,876 --> 00:14:00,670
I heard it's good luck to rub your head.

142
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:03,920
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
- Just telling you what I heard.

143
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:05,800
Rub my head.

144
00:14:08,595 --> 00:14:12,261
- Think the drinks are free for flyboys?
- Maybe if it's water.

145
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:46,424
Sorry, gentlemen.

146
00:14:46,424 --> 00:14:50,720
I'm afraid I can't allow you entrance
into this fine establishment.

147
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,765
This respite is reserved for killers.

148
00:14:56,559 --> 00:15:00,021
- You don't look like a killer to me.
- Don't I?

149
00:15:00,313 --> 00:15:02,690
I thought we all are on the same side.

150
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:06,569
You shot down any Germans
I don't know about, chocolate?

151
00:15:08,529 --> 00:15:11,574
- Not yet.
- Then move on, chaps.

152
00:15:16,454 --> 00:15:18,372
Attaboy, fuzzy.

153
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,051
Did you slip there, killer?

154
00:15:31,469 --> 00:15:32,636
Sit down, Grant.

155
00:15:32,636 --> 00:15:35,139
- I can take him.
- No, you can't.

156
00:15:35,139 --> 00:15:36,182
He's a professional.

157
00:15:36,307 --> 00:15:39,431
I saw him fight in Paris.
He knocked a guy out in the eighth round.

158
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:40,770
Sixth.

159
00:15:55,242 --> 00:15:58,162
Now, as for all of us being on the same side,

160
00:15:58,287 --> 00:16:01,015
until you actually do something,
you're not even in this war,

161
00:16:01,065 --> 00:16:02,583
let alone in this room.

162
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:03,709
TODD Why not?

163
00:16:03,709 --> 00:16:07,046
We're all fighting for the French,
same as you.

164
00:16:08,088 --> 00:16:09,965
Not the same as me.

165
00:16:15,179 --> 00:16:17,264
Let's go, champ.

166
00:16:24,563 --> 00:16:26,648
Still wanna rub my head?

167
00:16:32,613 --> 00:16:35,824
Gentlemen, this is the Nieuport 17.

168
00:16:35,824 --> 00:16:38,952
This plane is the newest French fighter.

169
00:16:39,369 --> 00:16:42,640
When you are proficient enough,
you'll be among the first to fly it.

170
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:46,543
But remember, it is the man
and not the machine that matters.

171
00:16:46,668 --> 00:16:49,730
His bullet is no faster than yours.

172
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:53,133
Go on your left. On your right.
Watch your back.

173
00:16:53,133 --> 00:16:54,718
Okay, Skinner.

174
00:16:55,635 --> 00:16:56,803
- That's good.
- I got that.

175
00:16:56,887 --> 00:16:58,221
Watch the fuel.

176
00:16:58,221 --> 00:17:01,892
If you run out of gas,
you will sleep with the Germans.

177
00:17:04,394 --> 00:17:05,437
Stop!

178
00:17:05,437 --> 00:17:07,647
Come on, Toddman. Watch your balance.

179
00:17:07,731 --> 00:17:11,151
No. Come on. Go, go, go.

180
00:17:13,236 --> 00:17:15,739
Come on, Jensen. Go, go, go, Jensen.

181
00:17:15,989 --> 00:17:19,009
Come on, Rawlings. Go, go. Come on.

182
00:17:19,059 --> 00:17:20,869
Watch your balance, no.

183
00:17:21,911 --> 00:17:23,079
Poor Skinner.

184
00:17:23,163 --> 00:17:25,248
A word about equipment.

185
00:17:25,749 --> 00:17:28,084
This is the Escadrille scarf.

186
00:17:29,335 --> 00:17:33,256
It is not just to make you
look good for the girls...

187
00:17:33,673 --> 00:17:34,924
What would he know about that?

188
00:17:34,924 --> 00:17:37,552
...but to keep your neck from being irritated

189
00:17:37,552 --> 00:17:42,765
from the constant turning
to spot enemy aircraft.

190
00:17:43,099 --> 00:17:44,434
Contact.

191
00:17:49,355 --> 00:17:50,982
- Go on, Rawlings!
- Go, Rawlings!

192
00:17:50,982 --> 00:17:52,025
Go, Rawlings!

193
00:18:00,491 --> 00:18:02,035
- What?
- See it?

194
00:18:13,921 --> 00:18:15,214
All right!

195
00:18:15,214 --> 00:18:16,966
You're on your own, yeah!

196
00:18:17,049 --> 00:18:18,426
He's going.

197
00:18:22,722 --> 00:18:25,224
- Go, Skinner.
- Skinner, let her rip.

198
00:18:25,641 --> 00:18:27,310
- All right, Beagle.
- Go get them. Get up there.

199
00:18:27,393 --> 00:18:28,853
Keep it straight.

200
00:18:29,979 --> 00:18:31,480
Come on, Lowry.

201
00:18:33,024 --> 00:18:38,779
Now that you are actually flying,
it is time to learn about tactics.

202
00:18:38,863 --> 00:18:41,574
Left. Right.

203
00:18:42,742 --> 00:18:43,743
- Both.
- Both.

204
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:45,828
Right. Left.

205
00:18:46,078 --> 00:18:50,162
In any form of attack,
it is best to fire in short bursts.

206
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:57,423
Follow him.

207
00:18:59,925 --> 00:19:03,596
Give me right, give me right.
Good, give me left, give me left.

208
00:19:05,889 --> 00:19:06,932
- More your left.
- Left.

209
00:19:06,932 --> 00:19:10,561
Your primary goal is to get on their tail.

210
00:19:10,769 --> 00:19:13,355
This is your best shooting position.

211
00:19:16,692 --> 00:19:19,445
Beagle. The target, Beagle.

212
00:19:20,487 --> 00:19:23,365
Come on, Beagle. The target, Beagle!

213
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:26,118
Go. Go, Rawlings. That's good.

214
00:19:26,535 --> 00:19:28,912
That's good. Go, Jensen.

215
00:19:28,912 --> 00:19:33,538
Go, Jensen. Good. Good, Skinner.
Good. Well done.

216
00:19:33,588 --> 00:19:36,962
We don't want you bringing
bullets home. We have millions.

217
00:19:36,962 --> 00:19:39,256
Leave the bullets up there.

218
00:19:39,882 --> 00:19:42,259
Let the Germans take them home.

219
00:19:55,731 --> 00:19:57,482
Good shot, Rawlings.

220
00:19:57,899 --> 00:19:58,817
Not bad.

221
00:20:00,193 --> 00:20:02,988
TODD Good shooting, cowboy.
Way to go, Rawlings.

222
00:20:09,995 --> 00:20:11,329
Rawlings.

223
00:20:12,164 --> 00:20:14,913
I want you to go up with Beagle
and teach him how to shoot.

224
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:17,168
Why me? You're the instructor.

225
00:20:17,294 --> 00:20:20,213
Because I'm tired of trying to teach him.

226
00:20:22,424 --> 00:20:23,758
All right.

227
00:20:29,472 --> 00:20:33,560
Beagle, you need to use
more right rudder when you dive.

228
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,353
I know, I know.

229
00:20:36,062 --> 00:20:37,731
Get off my back.

230
00:20:40,358 --> 00:20:42,610
Notify this Hun's next of kin.

231
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,323
Right rudder!

232
00:20:49,534 --> 00:20:51,619
There's something wrong with the gun!

233
00:20:51,619 --> 00:20:53,997
I know I can fly and I know I can shoot!

234
00:20:54,205 --> 00:20:57,458
Yeah, you just can't do them at the same time.

235
00:21:03,881 --> 00:21:06,718
- Where are we going?
- I don't know.

236
00:21:06,718 --> 00:21:09,971
Let's just fly around a little.
Have some fun.

237
00:21:14,434 --> 00:21:16,519
It's a beautiful country.

238
00:21:16,936 --> 00:21:19,355
Can see why the French fight for it.

239
00:21:19,355 --> 00:21:21,941
- Hey, Rawlings.
- What?

240
00:21:25,903 --> 00:21:28,823
- We're out of gas.
- What?

241
00:21:28,823 --> 00:21:32,368
- You didn't check it when we took off?
- I thought you did.

242
00:21:32,368 --> 00:21:34,453
You're the damn pilot!

243
00:21:34,745 --> 00:21:35,913
All right.

244
00:21:36,038 --> 00:21:39,667
Beagle, put it down over there. Over there.

245
00:21:39,667 --> 00:21:42,937
- No, there's more room over there.
- That terrain's too rough.

246
00:21:42,987 --> 00:21:45,006
- Put it over there.
- What terrain?

247
00:21:45,089 --> 00:21:47,591
- Watch your airspeed.
- I got it.

248
00:21:47,591 --> 00:21:50,511
- We're going too fast!
- Just shut up!

249
00:22:15,327 --> 00:22:16,787
Where am I?

250
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:26,880
Where's my... Where's my plane? My leg.

251
00:22:33,137 --> 00:22:36,890
Is this a... What do you call it?

252
00:22:39,393 --> 00:22:42,312
Do you speak English?

253
00:22:44,231 --> 00:22:47,734
- Hey, Rawlings, you came to.
- How'd we get here, ace?

254
00:22:47,734 --> 00:22:50,779
Well, first of all,
you left the plane in kind of a hurry.

255
00:22:50,779 --> 00:22:53,824
Then this one found you out back
and helped carry you in.

256
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:56,326
This ain't so bad.

257
00:23:19,349 --> 00:23:21,851
You want me to take my pants off?

258
00:23:23,436 --> 00:23:24,771
Okay.

259
00:23:39,869 --> 00:23:41,871
You seem to be in good hands here.

260
00:23:41,871 --> 00:23:44,707
I'm gonna go see if anybody wants
to look after my leg.

261
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:46,251
Oh, girls?

262
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:57,512
So you're a prostitute?

263
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:01,683
I mean, you don't look like one.

264
00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:05,436
You're very pretty.

265
00:24:05,728 --> 00:24:07,522
You understand? Pretty?

266
00:24:08,231 --> 00:24:10,024
Pretty...

267
00:24:12,735 --> 00:24:13,653
Like...

268
00:24:15,154 --> 00:24:16,155
Like the...

269
00:24:17,532 --> 00:24:20,993
The flower is pretty.

270
00:24:21,911 --> 00:24:25,181
And you are pretty like a flower.

271
00:24:25,231 --> 00:24:27,416
And you are pretty like a flower.

272
00:24:29,627 --> 00:24:31,170
Hey, Rawlings.

273
00:24:31,295 --> 00:24:33,506
You know, they don't give medals
for running out of gas.

274
00:24:33,589 --> 00:24:36,442
- You here to take us back?
- Yeah, but what's the hurry?

275
00:24:36,492 --> 00:24:37,426
Hey, watch it.

276
00:24:37,552 --> 00:24:39,929
What the hell?
She's a chippie, not a nurse.

277
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:44,767
You do realize that crash landing
your own plane doesn't count as combat.

278
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:46,727
Sorry about that.

279
00:24:47,269 --> 00:24:51,440
Listen, it was...
It was really nice to meet you.

280
00:24:53,109 --> 00:24:54,360
Yeah.

281
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:57,780
That was... That was for you.

282
00:25:13,295 --> 00:25:15,714
That guy knows how to live.

283
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:22,304
Guess all his friends aren't dead.

284
00:25:24,139 --> 00:25:27,309
Come on, Rawlings,
we've got a long drive home.

285
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:32,606
TODD Hey, Rawlings.
Meet the new arrivals.

286
00:25:32,606 --> 00:25:34,274
I was just showing them around.

287
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,649
Those circular tents at the back
are where the crew live.

288
00:25:37,699 --> 00:25:39,696
And you guys already know where the canteen is.

289
00:25:39,696 --> 00:25:41,782
Nunn will be sneaking in there
looking for cookies.

290
00:25:41,907 --> 00:25:43,742
He's got a sweet tooth. Right, Nunn?

291
00:25:43,742 --> 00:25:47,242
- Nunn doesn't say a whole lot.
- I can, if something comes up.

292
00:25:47,292 --> 00:25:49,581
TODD That's the mess hall
and the officers' club.

293
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:51,083
No chapel?

294
00:25:51,166 --> 00:25:53,585
Fellows, meet Porter.

295
00:25:54,002 --> 00:25:57,856
- You religious?
- I keep my Bible close.

296
00:25:57,906 --> 00:26:00,550
What's a man of God doing here at war?

297
00:26:00,968 --> 00:26:03,595
Hopefully the same thing you are.

298
00:26:04,096 --> 00:26:07,015
How are the barracks, by the way?
TODD Yeah.

299
00:26:07,849 --> 00:26:11,269
- Nothing fancy.
- Yeah, nothing fancy.

300
00:27:46,781 --> 00:27:49,951
- Whose planes are these?
- They are yours.

301
00:28:03,172 --> 00:28:04,215
Hey!

302
00:28:04,965 --> 00:28:06,300
- Are those really ours?
- These really are amazing.

303
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,885
- We get to fly them?
- These are great.

304
00:28:07,968 --> 00:28:09,970
Merry Christmas, boys.

305
00:28:10,054 --> 00:28:12,890
- This one's mine.
- Almost makes you feel sorry for the Huns.

306
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:14,308
My, oh, my.

307
00:28:14,433 --> 00:28:17,228
So why do they all have Indian heads on them?

308
00:28:17,228 --> 00:28:19,230
It is the Escadrille insignia.

309
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:21,732
Well, why that?
I mean, Indians were defeated.

310
00:28:21,732 --> 00:28:25,069
Yeah, but they were brave. I like it.

311
00:28:25,069 --> 00:28:29,778
You're allowed to have a personal insignia
on the forward part of the fuselage.

312
00:28:29,828 --> 00:28:32,493
Well, that's good.
Let them know who we are.

313
00:28:32,493 --> 00:28:36,330
I've already picked this one out
for myself, so hands off.

314
00:28:37,247 --> 00:28:39,583
No, Skinner, find your own.

315
00:29:00,437 --> 00:29:03,231
It's great. Looks just like it.

316
00:29:04,274 --> 00:29:07,194
- Hey, Lowry, that's good.
- Thanks, Jensen.

317
00:29:07,194 --> 00:29:11,573
I was going to be an artist,
until my father thought better of it.

318
00:29:11,865 --> 00:29:13,533
Would you paint me a knight?

319
00:29:13,533 --> 00:29:15,535
We're kind of like flying knights,
don't you think?

320
00:29:15,535 --> 00:29:17,287
- Sure.
- Thanks.

321
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:24,503
- What's that, Nunn?
- A woodpecker.

322
00:29:24,628 --> 00:29:26,463
That ought to really scare them.

323
00:29:26,588 --> 00:29:28,965
I think it says we're gonna put
a whole bunch of holes in them.

324
00:29:28,965 --> 00:29:32,048
I think that it says that you've got
a bunch of holes in your brain.

325
00:29:32,098 --> 00:29:34,221
Whatever it is, get it done.

326
00:29:34,221 --> 00:29:36,181
We're going to war in two days.

327
00:29:36,306 --> 00:29:38,141
Knights of the air.

328
00:29:41,728 --> 00:29:44,314
What? We are. We're like knights.

329
00:29:44,314 --> 00:29:47,317
The Germans are moving toward the Meuse River

330
00:29:47,317 --> 00:29:50,070
as part of their push to take Paris.

331
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:53,698
In order to stop their advance in our sector,

332
00:29:53,698 --> 00:29:57,660
you will rendezvous over Doulcon
with two Handley Page bombers

333
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:01,431
at 0600 tomorrow and escort them to Jametz

334
00:30:01,481 --> 00:30:05,793
where they are to destroy the main
German ammunition and supply depot.

335
00:30:06,503 --> 00:30:10,673
It is heavily fortified
by observation balloons,

336
00:30:10,673 --> 00:30:17,597
cables on three sides,
and Archie batteries in these six positions.

337
00:30:17,889 --> 00:30:20,808
Cassidy will be your squadron leader.

338
00:30:20,933 --> 00:30:23,102
He'll be watching over you.

339
00:30:23,853 --> 00:30:25,813
Remember your training.

340
00:30:25,813 --> 00:30:28,608
Don't fly straight lines.

341
00:30:28,733 --> 00:30:32,612
Be an elusive target and an efficient hunter.

342
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,823
Any questions?

343
00:30:36,866 --> 00:30:38,201
Yes, sir.

344
00:30:38,743 --> 00:30:40,828
Will we be back by lunch?

345
00:30:44,457 --> 00:30:47,084
I meant any intelligent questions.

346
00:30:47,793 --> 00:30:51,964
I'm sorry, just trying to loosen things up.

347
00:30:52,214 --> 00:30:53,341
Don't.

348
00:31:10,566 --> 00:31:11,984
Hey, fellows.

349
00:31:12,318 --> 00:31:15,237
What do you think I ought
to wear tomorrow? Yellow or purple?

350
00:31:15,237 --> 00:31:17,531
Anything but the pink.
You get shot down in that,

351
00:31:17,531 --> 00:31:20,576
you're gonna embarrass the entire Escadrille.

352
00:31:24,496 --> 00:31:27,666
What are you talking
about getting shot down for?

353
00:31:27,666 --> 00:31:29,835
What's the matter, you nervous?

354
00:31:30,878 --> 00:31:34,214
Hell, no. You? You brought it up.

355
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:38,927
We're all nervous, except Porter.

356
00:31:39,011 --> 00:31:41,013
He's got religion on his side.

357
00:31:42,681 --> 00:31:44,433
I'm not nervous.

358
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:48,433
Hey, it's all right to be a little edgy
before a fight.

359
00:31:48,483 --> 00:31:51,732
Keeps you sharp. Isn't that right, Skinner?

360
00:31:52,566 --> 00:31:56,528
The fights I been in,
they don't shoot at you.

361
00:31:59,239 --> 00:32:01,867
We should hit the sack. We get up at 4:00.

362
00:32:06,538 --> 00:32:07,873
Rawlings.

363
00:32:11,877 --> 00:32:14,046
I wanna see you for a minute.

364
00:32:26,641 --> 00:32:28,310
Just saying hello.

365
00:32:29,978 --> 00:32:31,146
Hello.

366
00:32:33,148 --> 00:32:34,816
Come on in.

367
00:32:37,319 --> 00:32:39,404
I was looking at your file,

368
00:32:39,571 --> 00:32:42,073
and it's my job to write a letter home
to your parents

369
00:32:42,073 --> 00:32:44,075
if anything should happen to you.

370
00:32:44,075 --> 00:32:48,663
Since both your parents are dead,
who's your next of kin?

371
00:32:48,997 --> 00:32:52,208
I don't know. I don't really have any.

372
00:33:00,425 --> 00:33:06,181
You know, if you die here,
your family name dies with you.

373
00:33:06,514 --> 00:33:09,100
Well, I don't plan on dying.

374
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:12,520
None of the guys
in the squadron cemetery did either.

375
00:33:14,731 --> 00:33:16,190
Think about it.

376
00:33:22,864 --> 00:33:25,450
Yeah, I'll think about that, sir.

377
00:33:36,419 --> 00:33:37,670
Stay.

378
00:34:07,074 --> 00:34:08,659
- Lowry?
- Yes, sir.

379
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:11,037
If you feel you're gonna crash,
take off your goggles

380
00:34:11,037 --> 00:34:13,330
because the glass can cut your eyes, d'accord?

381
00:34:18,335 --> 00:34:21,464
- Hey, you're still here, Rawlings.
- Yeah.

382
00:34:22,006 --> 00:34:23,841
Thought I'd take my chances.

383
00:34:25,217 --> 00:34:26,677
What's this?

384
00:34:27,595 --> 00:34:30,764
It's just the brand of the ranch
my family owned

385
00:34:31,181 --> 00:34:33,350
till the bank foreclosed.

386
00:34:34,935 --> 00:34:36,895
Beagle, get here.

387
00:34:39,607 --> 00:34:43,861
If your guns jam, it sometimes helps
to bang on the cocking handle.

388
00:34:46,196 --> 00:34:47,322
What's this for?

389
00:34:47,322 --> 00:34:50,451
Plane catches fire, you got three choices.

390
00:34:50,451 --> 00:34:53,287
Can stay in it and burn
with it all the way to the ground,

391
00:34:53,287 --> 00:34:55,789
you can jump from several thousand feet,

392
00:34:56,081 --> 00:34:59,418
or you can take the quick and painless way out.

393
00:35:00,127 --> 00:35:01,712
Good luck, gentlemen.

394
00:35:05,048 --> 00:35:06,800
- Contact!
- Contact.

395
00:37:20,808 --> 00:37:22,184
I'm going up.

396
00:38:40,053 --> 00:38:41,429
Toddman!

397
00:40:04,428 --> 00:40:06,514
Yeah!

398
00:40:30,996 --> 00:40:37,670
Rawlings! I made it!
I'm all right! Go get them!

399
00:42:22,232 --> 00:42:24,025
Bastards were everywhere, sir.

400
00:42:24,025 --> 00:42:26,319
We got jumped before we reached Jametz.

401
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:28,488
They were all over us.
We never even made it to the bombers.

402
00:42:28,488 --> 00:42:30,281
- Where is Dewitt?
- Didn't make it.

403
00:42:30,406 --> 00:42:31,533
- And Toddman?
- Nope.

404
00:42:31,533 --> 00:42:34,577
Toddman was right there.
He was right there. Then he was gone.

405
00:42:34,577 --> 00:42:37,163
- Anybody see what happened to Nunn?
- Sir.

406
00:42:37,163 --> 00:42:40,416
He had to put it down.
He made it safely to the ground

407
00:42:40,416 --> 00:42:43,503
and this German dived on him and
shot him right when he was sitting there.

408
00:42:43,503 --> 00:42:46,464
- He had a black falcon on his plane?
- Yeah.

409
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:48,633
Something should be done.

410
00:42:48,633 --> 00:42:50,843
I mean, you don't just shoot
an airman on the ground.

411
00:42:50,843 --> 00:42:53,846
- Mission debriefing in 15 minutes.
- What about Nunn?

412
00:42:53,846 --> 00:42:55,181
He was just sitting there on the ground!

413
00:42:55,181 --> 00:42:58,101
A lot has happened in this war
before you got to it.

414
00:42:58,101 --> 00:43:01,270
I thought there was supposed to be
some sort of honor in the way we fight.

415
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:04,690
Reports can be filed. But you want justice?

416
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:08,361
You're the man in the air,
you're the man with the gun.

417
00:43:16,285 --> 00:43:17,536
Contact.

418
00:43:19,372 --> 00:43:21,916
Get those streamers off my plane.

419
00:43:33,052 --> 00:43:35,846
- What's he doing?
- He's going back up.

420
00:43:36,305 --> 00:43:38,974
- After what?
- Whatever he can find.

421
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:43,062
- He's going alone?
- Yeah.

422
00:43:43,896 --> 00:43:45,773
He prefers it that way.

423
00:43:51,737 --> 00:43:54,823
I had no idea
that it was going to be like that.

424
00:43:55,282 --> 00:43:57,368
Do better next time.

425
00:43:58,077 --> 00:43:59,828
Soon as I get one kill,

426
00:43:59,828 --> 00:44:01,830
show my father that I was in the thick of it,

427
00:44:01,830 --> 00:44:03,916
that's it, I'm going home.

428
00:44:08,295 --> 00:44:11,507
Went right through there.
Almost lost this.

429
00:44:14,676 --> 00:44:17,179
- You get any?
- Not the one I wanted.

430
00:44:17,471 --> 00:44:19,264
Not the Black Falcon.

431
00:44:21,934 --> 00:44:22,601
Oi.

432
00:44:24,353 --> 00:44:26,647
Where the hell do you think you're off to?

433
00:44:26,647 --> 00:44:28,315
Not tonight, Grant.

434
00:44:30,275 --> 00:44:32,361
You're not going anywhere.

435
00:44:33,862 --> 00:44:35,947
Not till you drink with us.

436
00:44:36,031 --> 00:44:39,368
- I thought it was only for killers.
- You'll do.

437
00:44:48,752 --> 00:44:53,548
Drink up, Rawlings.
You're still alive. That's something.

438
00:44:55,217 --> 00:44:56,676
I don't feel like it.

439
00:44:56,801 --> 00:44:59,471
The first time is always your hardest.

440
00:44:59,596 --> 00:45:01,556
To losing your virginity!

441
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:11,900
Does anyone here care
that three pilots died today?

442
00:45:12,108 --> 00:45:13,485
Pilots die every day.

443
00:45:13,568 --> 00:45:15,028
Have a drink. Calm down.

444
00:45:15,028 --> 00:45:17,739
I don't wanna calm down.
I wanna honor the men who died.

445
00:45:17,739 --> 00:45:20,575
Yeah, well, this is how we honor them.

446
00:45:20,867 --> 00:45:23,369
It's how we've always honored them.

447
00:45:23,578 --> 00:45:25,455
Now, none of us knows
how much time we have left,

448
00:45:25,455 --> 00:45:30,168
so we can't waste it sitting around
grieving about things we can't change.

449
00:45:31,419 --> 00:45:34,005
So you can either join in

450
00:45:34,923 --> 00:45:38,593
or you can go up to your room
and cry like a little baby.

451
00:45:38,593 --> 00:45:40,261
You suit yourself.

452
00:45:57,862 --> 00:46:00,073
Wake up, Rawlings. We're here.

453
00:46:03,284 --> 00:46:04,452
Hello.

454
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:08,206
I'm looking for the owner.

455
00:46:08,414 --> 00:46:10,708
No English. No English.

456
00:46:12,585 --> 00:46:15,713
- The owner of the house?
- I am the owner.

457
00:46:16,339 --> 00:46:21,052
Hi. I'm Blaine Rawlings.
I'm looking for a girl.

458
00:46:21,052 --> 00:46:22,303
You might remember me.

459
00:46:22,386 --> 00:46:26,349
- I injured my leg and she bandaged it up.
- Oh, Lucienne.

460
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:30,519
Maybe. She was wearing a brown skirt.

461
00:46:30,728 --> 00:46:33,314
But Lucienne is not one of my girls.

462
00:46:33,647 --> 00:46:35,733
- She's not?
- No, she does not work here.

463
00:46:35,733 --> 00:46:39,820
She was exchanging supplies,
a round of Brie for some chocolate.

464
00:46:44,074 --> 00:46:46,494
A round of Brie for some chocolate.

465
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:47,912
Madam?

466
00:46:48,746 --> 00:46:49,914
Madam.

467
00:46:50,247 --> 00:46:52,499
That girl, Lucienne,

468
00:46:53,584 --> 00:46:55,336
do you know where she lives?

469
00:46:55,336 --> 00:46:58,172
Down the Marlier Road,
about five kilometers.

470
00:46:58,672 --> 00:46:59,715
A small château,

471
00:46:59,715 --> 00:47:03,594
And how about that horse outside?
Do you know who owns that?

472
00:47:51,641 --> 00:47:52,684
Right.

473
00:48:14,247 --> 00:48:15,332
What?

474
00:48:22,172 --> 00:48:23,256
You know,

475
00:48:24,799 --> 00:48:28,762
- I'm mad at you. I'm mad. Understand?
- No.

476
00:48:29,596 --> 00:48:32,015
I'm mad. I'm mad at you.

477
00:48:34,809 --> 00:48:38,354
Because you made me think
that you were a prostitute.

478
00:48:39,272 --> 00:48:40,773
- You know?
- No.

479
00:48:44,194 --> 00:48:45,528
One moment.

480
00:48:55,121 --> 00:48:56,080
You?

481
00:48:57,123 --> 00:48:58,374
Are you?

482
00:48:59,542 --> 00:49:00,543
No.

483
00:49:01,627 --> 00:49:02,545
Well.

484
00:49:04,714 --> 00:49:05,882
Am I?

485
00:49:06,924 --> 00:49:07,884
No.

486
00:49:09,844 --> 00:49:10,887
No.

487
00:49:12,763 --> 00:49:16,847
No, I came because I wanted to see you.

488
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:20,897
I wanted to see

489
00:49:23,065 --> 00:49:24,025
you.

490
00:49:30,281 --> 00:49:33,743
Why did you pretend to...

491
00:49:39,999 --> 00:49:42,793
I afraid.

492
00:49:44,587 --> 00:49:46,130
You're afraid?

493
00:49:47,673 --> 00:49:48,757
Why?

494
00:49:53,846 --> 00:49:54,889
You

495
00:49:57,266 --> 00:49:59,602
die soon.

496
00:50:08,027 --> 00:50:10,946
Are these your children?

497
00:50:16,994 --> 00:50:18,787
- Oh, no.
- No?

498
00:50:21,874 --> 00:50:23,792
They're your brother's?

499
00:50:26,795 --> 00:50:28,046
- Wife.
- Wife.

500
00:50:28,046 --> 00:50:29,089
Wife?

501
00:50:29,214 --> 00:50:32,551
Your brother and his wife's?
Their children? Oh.

502
00:50:36,054 --> 00:50:37,139
Die?

503
00:50:38,974 --> 00:50:40,142
They died?

504
00:50:42,853 --> 00:50:43,812
Yes.

505
00:51:02,330 --> 00:51:04,833
Brother et wife.

506
00:51:10,255 --> 00:51:11,631
I'm sorry.

507
00:51:13,425 --> 00:51:17,345
The enfants must be sad.

508
00:51:22,892 --> 00:51:24,352
I have an idea.

509
00:51:25,186 --> 00:51:26,229
Come on.

510
00:51:50,962 --> 00:51:51,963
Hey!

511
00:51:52,630 --> 00:51:55,550
Hey. Hey! Hey!

512
00:52:02,932 --> 00:52:04,308
Thank you.

513
00:52:05,727 --> 00:52:07,311
Did you like it?

514
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,897
Does that mean I can come back?

515
00:52:11,816 --> 00:52:13,901
Can I come see you again?

516
00:52:15,987 --> 00:52:17,947
No, not the kids. You.

517
00:52:18,489 --> 00:52:20,992
Would you like to see me again?

518
00:52:23,578 --> 00:52:24,620
All right, bye.

519
00:52:27,957 --> 00:52:29,834
What are you gonna do?

520
00:52:36,716 --> 00:52:40,052
The Germans just bombed
the railway yard at Revigny.

521
00:52:40,177 --> 00:52:43,264
If you hurry, you can cut them off.

522
00:52:43,806 --> 00:52:46,726
It is a chance to be more aggressive
in your tactics.

523
00:52:46,726 --> 00:52:47,685
I want those chocks.

524
00:52:47,852 --> 00:52:51,439
If you do well,
you may get another chance at Jametz.

525
00:52:51,939 --> 00:52:55,067
Let's get the jump and dictate the engagement.

526
00:52:55,276 --> 00:52:56,318
Hurry.

527
00:52:57,278 --> 00:52:59,446
Come on, let's go.

528
00:53:06,537 --> 00:53:09,123
Come on, I'm keeping you guys alive.

529
00:58:04,249 --> 00:58:06,084
Now that's more like it.

530
00:58:06,084 --> 00:58:08,086
We really stitched them up good today.

531
00:58:08,169 --> 00:58:09,337
What?

532
00:58:09,337 --> 00:58:12,048
It's so goddamn noisy up there.
I can't hear a thing.

533
00:58:12,173 --> 00:58:15,385
You got two today, Blaine.
You're our ace so far.

534
00:58:15,593 --> 00:58:18,096
Well, you fired enough to take down six.

535
00:58:18,513 --> 00:58:21,349
You ever think about trying to miss,
Beagle? You might do better.

536
00:58:21,349 --> 00:58:22,767
I told you, my gun's all screwy.

537
00:58:22,892 --> 00:58:24,852
Oh, really? It's your gun, is it?

538
00:58:24,852 --> 00:58:26,104
What are you trying to say, Lowry?

539
00:58:26,104 --> 00:58:27,688
Cut it out.

540
00:58:27,772 --> 00:58:30,191
Someone should mention Porter.
He got one.

541
00:58:30,191 --> 00:58:31,776
Yeah, well, I was lucky.

542
00:58:31,776 --> 00:58:33,736
Germans just didn't want
to hear you sing anymore.

543
00:58:33,736 --> 00:58:35,613
Hey. Where's Higgins?

544
00:58:37,615 --> 00:58:38,616
No.

545
00:58:39,784 --> 00:58:41,452
I gotta sit down.

546
00:58:45,414 --> 00:58:47,708
- Is it bad?
- You're all right.

547
00:58:48,542 --> 00:58:50,628
Bullet went right by you.

548
00:58:58,886 --> 00:59:00,137
There's our men!

549
00:59:01,263 --> 00:59:03,474
The Yanks got their first Huns.

550
00:59:03,474 --> 00:59:05,559
- Good show.
- Well done. Excellent.

551
00:59:06,060 --> 00:59:08,646
Now you're officially killers.

552
00:59:09,313 --> 00:59:10,314
Come here, lads.

553
00:59:10,314 --> 00:59:11,690
Well done.

554
00:59:18,989 --> 00:59:22,117
We call this the Bottle of Death.

555
00:59:23,994 --> 00:59:26,914
You get one swig for every plane you down.

556
00:59:28,248 --> 00:59:32,686
Only reason I'm still alive is some German
let me go when my gun jammed.

557
00:59:32,736 --> 00:59:34,505
I don't know why the hell he did it.

558
00:59:34,505 --> 00:59:37,549
Did he have two crossed swords on his plane?

559
00:59:39,510 --> 00:59:42,763
Franz Wolfert. A triple ace.

560
00:59:45,891 --> 00:59:48,431
He did it because of what happened to Nunn.

561
00:59:48,481 --> 00:59:50,479
He won't let you off again.

562
00:59:52,689 --> 00:59:55,192
We know what happened to Higgins.

563
00:59:56,318 --> 00:59:57,569
Drink up.

564
01:00:15,212 --> 01:00:17,047
- Porter.
- I don't drink.

565
01:00:18,131 --> 01:00:19,257
- Come on.
- Take a drink...

566
01:00:19,382 --> 01:00:21,468
- I don't drink.
- Come on.

567
01:00:21,468 --> 01:00:22,385
- Take a drink.
- Drink up.

568
01:00:22,469 --> 01:00:26,556
- Drink, drink, drink, drink!
- Drink, drink, drink, drink!

569
01:00:39,152 --> 01:00:41,154
Those guys sure can tie one on. I mean...

570
01:00:41,154 --> 01:00:42,197
Yeah.

571
01:00:42,197 --> 01:00:43,990
...the more they fly, the more they drink.
- Yeah.

572
01:00:44,074 --> 01:00:46,785
Except for Cassidy.
He just goes on even more missions.

573
01:00:46,785 --> 01:00:48,995
The man's a mystery. He's not human.

574
01:00:48,995 --> 01:00:50,663
We don't even know where he's from.

575
01:00:50,663 --> 01:00:54,084
I heard that he lost his family
in an electrical fire.

576
01:00:54,084 --> 01:00:56,795
- Did you hear that?
- I heard he flew for Pancho Villa.

577
01:00:56,795 --> 01:00:57,837
So he's a mercenary?

578
01:00:57,837 --> 01:00:59,422
Why don't somebody just ask?

579
01:00:59,422 --> 01:01:02,634
Well, he's not too chatty
about his personal life.

580
01:01:02,634 --> 01:01:04,302
I'd just be happy he's flying on our side.

581
01:01:04,427 --> 01:01:05,345
Yeah.

582
01:01:05,553 --> 01:01:07,847
Especially with the new tri-wings
the Germans got,

583
01:01:07,847 --> 01:01:09,849
125-horsepower engines.

584
01:01:09,849 --> 01:01:13,269
Nine-millimeter Spandau machine guns
with twice the ammo capacity.

585
01:01:13,269 --> 01:01:16,272
They can out-turn us
and they have a 1,000 feet-a-minute climb.

586
01:01:16,272 --> 01:01:17,940
They're the most maneuverable planes
in the sky.

587
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:20,026
Well, yeah, maybe you'd be happier
fighting for them.

588
01:01:20,026 --> 01:01:22,445
Yeah. A lot fewer of our guys would get shot.

589
01:01:22,445 --> 01:01:23,780
Real funny.

590
01:01:25,281 --> 01:01:27,033
- Hey, listen.
- What?

591
01:01:27,950 --> 01:01:30,578
There's something not right about Beagle,
you know?

592
01:01:30,578 --> 01:01:31,621
What do you mean?

593
01:01:31,621 --> 01:01:35,041
- I mean, he doesn't get any mail, right?
- So?

594
01:01:35,041 --> 01:01:37,793
Yeah, he never hits
any of the Germans he shoots at.

595
01:01:38,211 --> 01:01:41,043
Well, a lot of guys don't have kills.

596
01:01:41,093 --> 01:01:45,051
And now he's an expert on German
aircraft. When did that happen?

597
01:01:45,384 --> 01:01:48,304
Man, you're scratching fleas on a stuffed dog.

598
01:01:48,930 --> 01:01:49,972
Nothing there.

599
01:01:50,056 --> 01:01:51,641
Right, we'll see.

600
01:01:51,641 --> 01:01:53,643
Blaine, hey, I'm telling you,

601
01:01:54,226 --> 01:01:56,979
there's something not right with that guy.

602
01:02:04,153 --> 01:02:05,821
Hey, you asleep?

603
01:02:07,156 --> 01:02:08,240
No.

604
01:02:10,326 --> 01:02:13,537
A few years ago,
we didn't even have airplanes.

605
01:02:13,746 --> 01:02:15,748
Now there's thousands of us,

606
01:02:15,748 --> 01:02:19,251
with one half trying to kill the other half.

607
01:02:19,251 --> 01:02:21,337
Yeah, that's how it goes.

608
01:02:22,504 --> 01:02:25,007
You really have your own ranch?

609
01:02:25,007 --> 01:02:28,260
I did, 900 acres.

610
01:02:28,677 --> 01:02:31,180
Was in my family for 85 years.

611
01:02:31,764 --> 01:02:33,849
It was a tradition.

612
01:02:33,849 --> 01:02:37,311
Grow up and you work the ranch.

613
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:38,854
Till my ma left and

614
01:02:40,856 --> 01:02:43,358
my dad died all mortgaged out.

615
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:48,363
It was kind of hard to make a go of it.

616
01:02:48,363 --> 01:02:52,051
So what you gonna do now?
I mean, when the war is over?

617
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:53,577
I don't know.

618
01:02:55,454 --> 01:02:58,874
Maybe I'll keep flying
if there's any call for it.

619
01:03:00,959 --> 01:03:02,753
Or get a new ranch.

620
01:03:03,462 --> 01:03:05,047
How about you?

621
01:03:06,089 --> 01:03:07,549
Hard to say.

622
01:03:08,383 --> 01:03:12,054
I came here
'cause I heard they treated Negroes better.

623
01:03:14,139 --> 01:03:16,516
- Do they?
- They were good to me.

624
01:03:18,894 --> 01:03:21,313
I don't wanna go back to boxing.

625
01:03:22,981 --> 01:03:27,360
I'm tired of pounding on people,
keeping my anger up all the time.

626
01:03:29,237 --> 01:03:30,906
And I like flying.

627
01:03:32,157 --> 01:03:36,119
Hell, if you're not fighting,
it's nice and peaceful up there.

628
01:03:37,370 --> 01:03:39,247
Nobody can touch you.

629
01:03:40,290 --> 01:03:43,209
Nobody can make you feel low.

630
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:49,049
You think there'll be any future
in flying after the war?

631
01:03:49,174 --> 01:03:50,300
Maybe.

632
01:03:52,927 --> 01:03:57,515
I mean, there's always giving people
rides at fairs and things like that.

633
01:03:58,516 --> 01:04:04,272
And I hear they might use planes
to deliver mail from city to city.

634
01:04:04,355 --> 01:04:05,607
Really?

635
01:04:07,275 --> 01:04:11,279
Yeah, I like that.
That'd be a good job for me.

636
01:04:13,364 --> 01:04:17,285
I figure as long as I'm up in the air,
they can't see me,

637
01:04:18,536 --> 01:04:20,872
they won't mind if I'm black.

638
01:04:24,709 --> 01:04:27,211
There's something wrong with Jensen.

639
01:04:27,211 --> 01:04:28,796
He's down here.

640
01:04:37,722 --> 01:04:38,681
Hey?

641
01:04:39,932 --> 01:04:40,892
Hey?

642
01:04:42,018 --> 01:04:43,060
Jensen?

643
01:04:44,228 --> 01:04:45,897
Can you hear me?

644
01:04:46,397 --> 01:04:48,900
- Jensen?
- Thought this might happen.

645
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:52,445
Jensen?
You're going through a little shock.

646
01:04:52,653 --> 01:04:53,988
Don't think about flying for a while.

647
01:04:53,988 --> 01:04:55,239
You don't have to go up again
until you're ready.

648
01:04:55,364 --> 01:04:57,033
You understand me?

649
01:04:58,075 --> 01:05:00,244
Do you understand me, Jensen?

650
01:05:06,625 --> 01:05:09,336
He tries flying tomorrow, stop him.

651
01:05:10,796 --> 01:05:12,757
Not that you'll have to.

652
01:05:13,174 --> 01:05:15,926
Meantime, get him some bourbon.

653
01:05:16,427 --> 01:05:19,138
- Go get the bourbon.
- I'll get it.

654
01:05:39,283 --> 01:05:43,454
- How you are?
- Non, Say, 'How are you?'

655
01:05:48,459 --> 01:05:50,002
'How are you?'

656
01:06:17,112 --> 01:06:20,032
- How you are?
- How are you?

657
01:06:23,577 --> 01:06:25,036
That's good.

658
01:06:25,036 --> 01:06:28,932
You speak English now.
Then we can have a conversation.

659
01:06:30,167 --> 01:06:32,335
Let me hear your English.

660
01:06:34,504 --> 01:06:36,006
Good you see?

661
01:06:37,007 --> 01:06:38,508
Yeah, good.

662
01:06:39,009 --> 01:06:40,760
Good to see you, too.

663
01:06:58,124 --> 01:06:59,208
See?

664
01:07:00,751 --> 01:07:03,546
This is my rabbit. Wanna pet it?

665
01:07:03,879 --> 01:07:06,716
Better be gentle. He's jumpy.

666
01:07:09,218 --> 01:07:10,219
Oh.

667
01:07:10,886 --> 01:07:13,889
He looks a little cold.
I think we'll give him a little blanket there.

668
01:07:13,889 --> 01:07:16,809
How's that? There you go.

669
01:07:20,479 --> 01:07:22,022
What about you?

670
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:24,400
Do you ever have any fun?

671
01:07:30,781 --> 01:07:32,032
No time.

672
01:07:32,992 --> 01:07:36,328
No, you're wrong.
Right now's the perfect time.

673
01:07:37,162 --> 01:07:40,249
We don't know how many chances we're gonna get.

674
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:44,837
Want to take a ride? In my avion?

675
01:07:45,796 --> 01:07:46,755
- Come on.
- No.

676
01:07:46,922 --> 01:07:48,173
- Come on.
- No.

677
01:09:28,699 --> 01:09:29,784
Here.

678
01:09:37,375 --> 01:09:39,961
Picked a great day to fly, didn't I?

679
01:09:41,629 --> 01:09:43,965
Did you have fun in the air?

680
01:09:46,050 --> 01:09:48,302
Fun in the plane?

681
01:09:53,307 --> 01:09:54,266
Okay.

682
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:58,020
What's this?

683
01:10:00,648 --> 01:10:02,316
'It's not good

684
01:10:03,150 --> 01:10:06,153
'for me to like you.'

685
01:10:08,989 --> 01:10:09,990
Why?

686
01:10:12,910 --> 01:10:15,829
'Because I worry.'

687
01:10:17,748 --> 01:10:19,833
You're worried about me?

688
01:10:45,150 --> 01:10:46,193
For me?

689
01:10:47,444 --> 01:10:48,904
From Marie?

690
01:10:50,864 --> 01:10:53,283
Maybe he'll bring me good luck.

691
01:11:04,044 --> 01:11:05,170
Paris?

692
01:11:05,295 --> 01:11:06,963
I've never been.

693
01:11:08,215 --> 01:11:11,635
Maybe you could take me.
Show me all them lights.

694
01:11:19,643 --> 01:11:20,894
Afraid?

695
01:11:22,479 --> 01:11:25,398
- There's a war.
- Am I afraid of the war?

696
01:11:27,984 --> 01:11:29,069
No.

697
01:11:30,195 --> 01:11:31,988
- No?
- No.

698
01:11:35,825 --> 01:11:36,993
Okay.

699
01:11:39,245 --> 01:11:40,205
Yes.

700
01:11:43,541 --> 01:11:45,418
Every time I go up,

701
01:11:46,252 --> 01:11:47,587
I'm afraid.

702
01:12:32,340 --> 01:12:33,591
Rawlings.

703
01:12:35,801 --> 01:12:39,222
- You hear about Beagle?
- No, what?

704
01:12:40,139 --> 01:12:41,933
I went to Thenault about him.

705
01:12:42,058 --> 01:12:45,078
- Why would you do that?
- Thenault had him checked out.

706
01:12:45,128 --> 01:12:47,146
His whole background's all wet laundry.

707
01:12:47,229 --> 01:12:51,108
- Everything in his file is made-up.
- They think he's a spy.

708
01:12:55,571 --> 01:12:58,824
Your behavior has raised suspicion
among the men,

709
01:12:58,824 --> 01:13:04,163
and now we discover
that Eddie Beagle is not your real name.

710
01:13:04,246 --> 01:13:07,600
- It's Arthur Becker, huh?
- So I changed my name.

711
01:13:07,650 --> 01:13:09,877
You're from Wisconsin, I see.

712
01:13:11,253 --> 01:13:14,378
There is a very large German population
in Wisconsin

713
01:13:14,428 --> 01:13:16,425
and your name is German.

714
01:13:16,842 --> 01:13:18,219
I'm no spy.

715
01:13:18,344 --> 01:13:23,098
Why didn't you give us your correct name?
Are you a German sympathizer?

716
01:13:24,058 --> 01:13:25,100
No.

717
01:13:25,517 --> 01:13:27,102
We will find out the truth.

718
01:13:27,102 --> 01:13:29,897
- Look, it's not what you think.
- Why not?

719
01:13:33,525 --> 01:13:35,736
We shoot spies, you know.

720
01:13:38,238 --> 01:13:40,240
Sir, may I?

721
01:13:43,368 --> 01:13:44,369
Beagle.

722
01:13:46,788 --> 01:13:49,708
- Come clean.
- I can't.

723
01:13:49,791 --> 01:13:53,045
They're gonna shoot you.
What could be worse than that?

724
01:13:53,045 --> 01:13:55,981
- I swear I'm not a spy.
- I know.

725
01:13:56,031 --> 01:13:59,509
So just tell them what you did
or they're gonna lock you up.

726
01:13:59,509 --> 01:14:01,386
Is that what you want?

727
01:14:08,268 --> 01:14:10,645
I committed a crime back in the States.

728
01:14:12,022 --> 01:14:14,733
- Spit it out, Beagle.
- I robbed a bank.

729
01:14:15,567 --> 01:14:18,487
Hey, I was in debt to a bookie,
and I needed the money.

730
01:14:18,487 --> 01:14:21,323
Was anyone hurt in the robbery?

731
01:14:21,323 --> 01:14:22,324
No.

732
01:14:22,449 --> 01:14:24,326
How can we be sure?

733
01:14:26,411 --> 01:14:28,496
Because I used a toy gun.

734
01:14:29,539 --> 01:14:30,999
Excuse me?

735
01:14:30,999 --> 01:14:33,585
I used a toy gun. It was all I had.

736
01:14:38,715 --> 01:14:41,217
Can you prove what you're saying?

737
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:42,761
No.

738
01:14:44,012 --> 01:14:45,263
I can't.

739
01:14:45,805 --> 01:14:46,931
I can.

740
01:14:51,352 --> 01:14:53,938
I saw a discrepancy in his next of kin file

741
01:14:53,938 --> 01:14:56,524
so I sent away for more information,

742
01:14:57,192 --> 01:15:00,695
and I was sent these telegrams
confirming the robbery.

743
01:15:01,863 --> 01:15:04,449
Beagle, in his haste to escape an armed guard,

744
01:15:04,449 --> 01:15:07,493
dropped most of the money
along with the toy gun.

745
01:15:07,493 --> 01:15:10,830
And although he escaped with only $12.36,

746
01:15:10,830 --> 01:15:12,624
he is guilty of armed robbery

747
01:15:12,624 --> 01:15:14,292
and if he was returned to the United States,

748
01:15:14,292 --> 01:15:17,211
they would lock him up
for a very, very long time.

749
01:15:17,211 --> 01:15:22,004
The question for us is, can we allow him
to continue flying for the Escadrilles

750
01:15:22,054 --> 01:15:25,553
because we have no legal jurisdiction
in this matter?

751
01:15:27,930 --> 01:15:29,599
It is up to you.

752
01:15:30,141 --> 01:15:31,809
Don't look at me.

753
01:15:32,393 --> 01:15:35,313
Whether he continues to fly is up to them.

754
01:15:35,980 --> 01:15:37,732
It's their squadron.

755
01:15:41,485 --> 01:15:46,574
Well, I'd like to know what you would have
done if they didn't give you the money.

756
01:15:47,241 --> 01:15:50,161
I don't know. Throw the toy gun at him?

757
01:15:50,161 --> 01:15:53,247
- You probably would have missed.
- Definitely.

758
01:16:04,216 --> 01:16:05,176
Sir?

759
01:16:07,344 --> 01:16:10,055
We don't condone what Beagle's done,

760
01:16:10,890 --> 01:16:13,809
or the horrible way in which he botched it.

761
01:16:14,768 --> 01:16:19,231
But we also don't think he should be
thrown out on stupidity alone.

762
01:16:19,231 --> 01:16:22,359
Although I'd never trust him with my wallet,

763
01:16:22,359 --> 01:16:26,030
I think we all will continue to trust him
with our lives,

764
01:16:26,447 --> 01:16:30,492
on the off chance that one day
he might actually hit something.

765
01:16:34,371 --> 01:16:35,706
So be it.

766
01:16:58,437 --> 01:17:02,107
Toy gun, huh? That's good. Yeah.

767
01:17:15,203 --> 01:17:18,369
You see, that's why
we have to load our own ammo.

768
01:17:18,419 --> 01:17:21,460
Half these bullets are bent.
Then the guns jam.

769
01:17:21,793 --> 01:17:23,754
They spotted a group of Fokkers.

770
01:17:23,754 --> 01:17:26,173
They're headed towards our infantry
on the road to Rambucourt.

771
01:17:26,173 --> 01:17:27,215
Let's go.

772
01:18:43,416 --> 01:18:45,418
Yes! Yeah!

773
01:18:46,169 --> 01:18:47,295
Lowry!

774
01:22:53,372 --> 01:22:56,417
- Can you move?
- No, something's pinning my hand.

775
01:23:03,924 --> 01:23:06,176
Just get out of here, Rawlings!

776
01:23:29,950 --> 01:23:33,220
Hey, come here, come here, come here.
Push the tail up.

777
01:23:33,270 --> 01:23:34,663
Wait. Wait.

778
01:23:39,793 --> 01:23:41,753
Okay, push! Push!

779
01:23:47,050 --> 01:23:50,637
- Rawlings, please, just go.
- I'm not gonna leave you.

780
01:23:54,266 --> 01:23:55,642
Just go!

781
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:17,080
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry, Beagle.

782
01:24:17,080 --> 01:24:19,707
No, Rawlings, no!

783
01:24:21,251 --> 01:24:22,502
Get up!

784
01:24:23,586 --> 01:24:25,129
Move! Go!

785
01:24:26,089 --> 01:24:27,507
Go!

786
01:24:44,190 --> 01:24:45,441
My hand!

787
01:25:00,873 --> 01:25:02,667
Mind if I join you?

788
01:25:12,677 --> 01:25:14,053
This is a

789
01:25:14,887 --> 01:25:19,058
100-year-old bottle of Louis XV.
It's incredible.

790
01:25:20,393 --> 01:25:23,229
Would you care to share a glass with me?

791
01:25:23,813 --> 01:25:26,148
This 'cause I saved your life?

792
01:25:26,857 --> 01:25:29,902
No. No, it's because I've been a pompous ass.

793
01:25:33,113 --> 01:25:34,657
Pour me a glass.

794
01:25:41,455 --> 01:25:42,831
Oh, my.

795
01:25:42,831 --> 01:25:45,417
I stole this from my father's cellar.

796
01:25:45,751 --> 01:25:48,671
If he'd have known, he would probably say

797
01:25:48,754 --> 01:25:52,716
it's the only thing I've ever done
successfully in my life.

798
01:25:53,425 --> 01:25:54,593
Please.

799
01:26:07,940 --> 01:26:09,107
Nice.

800
01:26:10,651 --> 01:26:12,444
I'm glad you like it.

801
01:26:13,570 --> 01:26:16,156
He's gotta be proud you came here.

802
01:26:18,075 --> 01:26:19,201
No.

803
01:26:20,535 --> 01:26:24,331
Actually, it was kind of his idea.

804
01:26:27,751 --> 01:26:32,339
And how many planes you gotta
bring down to get back in his good graces?

805
01:26:32,672 --> 01:26:34,424
Probably just my own.

806
01:26:38,929 --> 01:26:40,889
What does your father do?

807
01:26:42,974 --> 01:26:44,851
My daddy was a slave.

808
01:27:11,127 --> 01:27:13,505
You restless tonight, Rawlings?

809
01:27:16,841 --> 01:27:18,218
Maybe.

810
01:27:20,428 --> 01:27:24,057
- What about you?
- It was a good day.

811
01:27:25,725 --> 01:27:27,393
Not for Wolfert.

812
01:27:29,604 --> 01:27:34,067
- You had no choice but to kill him.
- He had a choice with me.

813
01:27:35,401 --> 01:27:37,695
Yeah, whatever happened in the air
or whatever happened on the ground

814
01:27:37,695 --> 01:27:40,948
with Beagle,
you gotta get that out of your head.

815
01:27:42,408 --> 01:27:43,868
Okay.

816
01:27:44,702 --> 01:27:47,413
Meanwhile, Beagle goes through life
without a hand.

817
01:27:47,413 --> 01:27:50,750
He volunteered for this war.
He knew what he was getting into.

818
01:27:51,709 --> 01:27:54,712
I don't care what happened in the past.
You can't let that affect you.

819
01:27:54,712 --> 01:27:57,548
You got to forget about it.
Otherwise you're a danger to yourself

820
01:27:57,548 --> 01:27:59,634
and everyone else up there.

821
01:28:00,551 --> 01:28:02,637
Do you let go of the past?

822
01:28:05,973 --> 01:28:07,016
I...

823
01:28:08,768 --> 01:28:10,686
I heard some things.

824
01:28:14,649 --> 01:28:17,985
- That you lost...
- That I lost my family in a fire?

825
01:28:21,822 --> 01:28:26,077
No. I didn't fly for Pancho Villa either.

826
01:28:27,995 --> 01:28:32,041
The truth is, I was a lot like you.

827
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:36,003
Full of idealism,
maybe even a sense of honor.

828
01:28:39,548 --> 01:28:42,885
Then you realize this war
ain't gonna be won by either side.

829
01:28:43,928 --> 01:28:45,930
Some day it'll just end.

830
01:28:55,397 --> 01:28:58,734
And everyone will go home,
get on with their lives.

831
01:29:00,402 --> 01:29:03,322
Tall grass will cover the battlefield.

832
01:29:05,532 --> 01:29:08,744
And all the pilots we've lost
wouldn't have changed a damn thing.

833
01:29:13,624 --> 01:29:15,417
Guys like you won't quit.

834
01:29:16,793 --> 01:29:19,588
So I got to stick around
and try to knock some Huns off your tails,

835
01:29:19,588 --> 01:29:22,716
and give you a chance to survive
this useless war.

836
01:29:22,925 --> 01:29:26,386
- That's what you do.
- Not with enough success.

837
01:29:28,013 --> 01:29:31,141
The guys I started with
are a testament to that.

838
01:29:33,560 --> 01:29:39,066
Well, if this war is really meaningless,
then why do you fly extra missions?

839
01:29:39,483 --> 01:29:41,693
Get the ones I've missed.

840
01:29:43,904 --> 01:29:46,490
Get the ones that killed my friends.

841
01:29:52,412 --> 01:29:55,332
You got to find your own meaning in this war.

842
01:29:56,583 --> 01:30:00,337
I mean, I'll be real disappointed
if we had more pilots die in vain

843
01:30:00,337 --> 01:30:01,922
than the Germans.

844
01:30:12,015 --> 01:30:13,808
How many you got left?

845
01:30:15,602 --> 01:30:16,853
One.

846
01:30:17,896 --> 01:30:19,439
The Black Falcon.

847
01:30:52,055 --> 01:30:56,476
See, this whole wing.
Patch on a patch.

848
01:30:56,476 --> 01:30:58,436
And when they gonna send us a new canvas?

849
01:30:58,436 --> 01:31:00,813
- Always 'next time.'
- Hey, Rawlings.

850
01:31:00,813 --> 01:31:02,815
The Germans have crossed the Meuse River.

851
01:31:02,815 --> 01:31:05,735
And reports say they've overrun Souilly.

852
01:31:06,152 --> 01:31:07,737
Lucienne.

853
01:31:08,571 --> 01:31:11,073
Is that plane fuelled? Is this plane fuelled?

854
01:31:11,073 --> 01:31:12,325
- Rawlings!
- Yes, sir.

855
01:31:12,325 --> 01:31:14,493
Give me a start. Give me a start. Let's go.

856
01:31:14,493 --> 01:31:17,496
Rawlings, you know you're
not allowed to take the plane!

857
01:31:43,481 --> 01:31:45,858
Hey. Hey.

858
01:31:47,776 --> 01:31:50,379
- You all right? You all right?
- Yeah?

859
01:31:50,429 --> 01:31:53,365
- How you come?
- My plane. A vion,

860
01:31:55,451 --> 01:31:58,912
- Germans.
- All right. I'm gonna get you out of here.

861
01:31:59,747 --> 01:32:01,957
No, it's all right.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

862
01:32:03,917 --> 01:32:06,712
Go get them. Go get them.

863
01:32:11,008 --> 01:32:15,804
- If Rawlings returns alive, arrest him.
- Yes, sir.

864
01:32:18,640 --> 01:32:21,435
- Good luck.
- Stay right here. Okay?

865
01:32:21,435 --> 01:32:22,978
You don't go anywhere.
You stay right here.

866
01:32:33,530 --> 01:32:35,907
I'll be back before sunrise.

867
01:32:47,085 --> 01:32:48,253
- You got her?
- Got them.

868
01:32:48,336 --> 01:32:49,379
Come on, guys.

869
01:32:49,379 --> 01:32:52,507
What are you doing flying at night
without authorization?

870
01:32:52,507 --> 01:32:55,343
I don't have time to explain.
I have to go get one more person.

871
01:32:55,343 --> 01:32:59,844
This plane is not for your personal use.
Leave this plane and return to quarters.

872
01:32:59,894 --> 01:33:02,017
- That's an order!
- Yes, sir.

873
01:36:26,803 --> 01:36:28,555
Freeze!

874
01:36:30,432 --> 01:36:33,643
Hang on, Lucienne. Hang on.

875
01:36:59,752 --> 01:37:01,838
Monsieur Rawlings.

876
01:37:14,433 --> 01:37:16,310
Medic!

877
01:37:19,438 --> 01:37:20,898
Medic!

878
01:37:24,110 --> 01:37:25,778
Over here, over here.

879
01:39:09,631 --> 01:39:10,799
Doctor!

880
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:26,731
They're taking you to the hospital at Reims.

881
01:39:26,731 --> 01:39:28,316
You understand?

882
01:39:30,735 --> 01:39:33,338
They're right here. They're gonna be fine.

883
01:39:33,388 --> 01:39:36,032
They contacted your uncle,
and he's gonna take care of them

884
01:39:36,032 --> 01:39:38,743
until you recover. Okay?

885
01:39:39,661 --> 01:39:43,957
- Yes. You come?
- Yeah.

886
01:39:44,791 --> 01:39:48,962
- I'll come see you in Reims.
- Goodbye.

887
01:39:49,254 --> 01:39:50,630
Okay.

888
01:39:52,298 --> 01:39:53,341
All right.

889
01:40:01,057 --> 01:40:04,185
I have filled out the papers
formally charging you

890
01:40:04,185 --> 01:40:05,937
with dereliction of duty.

891
01:40:05,937 --> 01:40:11,609
That sort of thing cannot be tolerated
in a military unit. Not even this one.

892
01:40:11,901 --> 01:40:16,781
Reports indicate that an Escadrille pilot
flew four French refugees

893
01:40:16,906 --> 01:40:19,738
out of occupied territory while being shot at

894
01:40:19,788 --> 01:40:23,788
by both riflemen and anti-aircraft cannons.

895
01:40:24,831 --> 01:40:26,207
Busy night.

896
01:40:26,624 --> 01:40:31,796
I have been in direct communication
with HQ in Paris over your little escapade.

897
01:40:33,297 --> 01:40:36,300
They agree with my recommendation completely.

898
01:40:36,300 --> 01:40:39,720
So it won't do you any good to go over my head.

899
01:40:41,639 --> 01:40:44,016
- Take the cuffs off.
- Sir...

900
01:40:44,016 --> 01:40:47,770
Unless you want to fly his plane.
I think I forgot to sign that.

901
01:40:47,770 --> 01:40:50,064
Ask me about it again tomorrow.

902
01:40:54,443 --> 01:40:58,906
Congratulations, Rawlings.
And don't ever do that again.

903
01:41:09,667 --> 01:41:11,418
I won't, sir.

904
01:41:27,810 --> 01:41:30,187
Gentlemen,
there is a change of plan.

905
01:41:30,187 --> 01:41:32,815
We've had a little surprise thrown at us.

906
01:41:32,815 --> 01:41:36,276
A German zeppelin is on its way to bomb Paris.

907
01:41:36,276 --> 01:41:40,464
As you know, our French and British
pilots are engaged at Pont-? Mousson.

908
01:41:40,514 --> 01:41:46,074
So Rawlings, Lowry, Skinner and Porter
will have to go after the zeppelin.

909
01:41:46,124 --> 01:41:48,455
Remember to load incendiary bullets.

910
01:41:48,455 --> 01:41:51,375
It can take hundreds to bring down a zeppelin.

911
01:41:51,375 --> 01:41:55,545
The rest of the squadron will support
the others at Pont-? Mousson.

912
01:41:55,754 --> 01:41:58,882
- May God be with you.
- Thank you, sir.

913
01:41:58,965 --> 01:42:00,217
Courage.

914
01:42:01,885 --> 01:42:03,387
- Courage.
- For thine is the kingdom, the power

915
01:42:03,470 --> 01:42:06,181
and the glory forever and ever. Amen.

916
01:42:08,141 --> 01:42:09,392
Courage.

917
01:42:10,143 --> 01:42:11,186
All right.

918
01:44:50,010 --> 01:44:54,264
You go down!
I'll take the zeppelin!

919
01:48:06,038 --> 01:48:07,789
No!

920
01:48:41,698 --> 01:48:44,617
- Amen.
- Amen.

921
01:48:49,497 --> 01:48:54,794
Today we have lost two brave fighters.
Two friends.

922
01:48:57,630 --> 01:49:03,136
Porter once told me that if he died,
he wanted to be buried by the airfield.

923
01:49:03,386 --> 01:49:05,638
Near those he fought alongside.

924
01:49:07,640 --> 01:49:12,437
I'm sure Cassidy would rather be buried
behind the whorehouse.

925
01:49:16,274 --> 01:49:20,361
Only a few days ago,
Cassidy gave me this letter

926
01:49:20,361 --> 01:49:24,115
to give to Rawlings in the event he died.

927
01:49:25,283 --> 01:49:27,368
Rawlings, please.

928
01:49:48,431 --> 01:49:53,311
'If I do not return,
my burial is of no import.

929
01:49:55,187 --> 01:49:58,649
'Make it as easy as possible for yourselves.

930
01:49:59,150 --> 01:50:02,903
'I have no religion
and do not care for any service.

931
01:50:04,155 --> 01:50:06,782
'If the omission would bother Porter,

932
01:50:09,368 --> 01:50:11,662
'I guess I would stand the ceremony.

933
01:50:13,038 --> 01:50:16,684
'Good luck to you all. Vive la Escadrille,

934
01:50:16,734 --> 01:50:21,255
'the only real friends I ever had. Cassidy.'

935
01:50:24,466 --> 01:50:27,094
A lot of us owe this man our lives.

936
01:50:28,137 --> 01:50:29,930
We won't forget him.

937
01:50:59,918 --> 01:51:01,420
Sir,

938
01:51:02,754 --> 01:51:05,674
I made a promise
that I'd meet someone at Reims.

939
01:51:06,300 --> 01:51:10,345
- Can I have permission to leave the base?
- Yes.

940
01:51:38,832 --> 01:51:40,375
Excuse me.

941
01:51:40,917 --> 01:51:42,168
Sorry.

942
01:51:43,295 --> 01:51:45,088
Excuse me, I'm looking for...

943
01:51:49,050 --> 01:51:50,510
Lucienne!

944
01:51:53,638 --> 01:51:55,432
Lucienne!

945
01:51:57,183 --> 01:51:59,060
Lucienne!

946
01:52:19,414 --> 01:52:21,082
Lucienne!

947
01:52:35,138 --> 01:52:37,348
I afraid.

948
01:52:38,266 --> 01:52:42,019
- Not see you.
- Yeah.

949
01:52:43,688 --> 01:52:45,481
You look good.

950
01:52:46,816 --> 01:52:48,776
Yeah. Okay.

951
01:52:51,195 --> 01:52:53,489
We go to England.

952
01:52:54,615 --> 01:52:56,534
Not safe for children.

953
01:52:57,451 --> 01:53:00,079
- Germans come here.
- I know.

954
01:53:04,041 --> 01:53:07,670
You and me in Paris

955
01:53:09,338 --> 01:53:10,798
after war?

956
01:53:11,632 --> 01:53:14,218
Your English is getting so good.

957
01:53:16,762 --> 01:53:17,888
I try.

958
01:53:19,056 --> 01:53:22,143
How will I reach you?
I'm gonna be moving.

959
01:53:26,647 --> 01:53:29,567
I have so much I wanna say to you.

960
01:53:29,900 --> 01:53:34,989
You will be in my thoughts

961
01:53:36,657 --> 01:53:39,493
and in my heart.

962
01:54:11,692 --> 01:54:15,445
I'll see you in Paris.
We'll turn on them lights.

963
01:54:15,529 --> 01:54:20,033
Be careful.
I will not be here to count the planes.

964
01:54:53,733 --> 01:54:56,319
Gentlemen, we are going to make another run

965
01:54:56,319 --> 01:54:58,488
on the munition depot at Jametz.

966
01:54:58,488 --> 01:55:01,241
This time escorting four bombers.

967
01:55:01,241 --> 01:55:05,741
Instead of a frontal attack,
we fly south to Marcheville first

968
01:55:05,791 --> 01:55:08,623
and then swing north to the strike area.

969
01:55:09,582 --> 01:55:13,753
This way, we might be able to surprise
them and get closer to the target

970
01:55:13,753 --> 01:55:16,422
before encountering resistance.

971
01:55:16,673 --> 01:55:19,884
As you may have heard,
the United States has just announced

972
01:55:19,884 --> 01:55:21,970
its entrance into the war.

973
01:55:21,970 --> 01:55:23,638
- Oh, good.
- Thank God for that.

974
01:55:23,638 --> 01:55:27,183
I don't need to tell you
that if we destroy Jametz,

975
01:55:27,183 --> 01:55:31,183
we severely reduce the flow
of ammunition to the German troops.

976
01:55:31,233 --> 01:55:33,940
Your brothers will be fighting on the ground.

977
01:55:34,607 --> 01:55:40,863
I know the last attack on Jametz
was a hard initiation for many of you.

978
01:55:41,864 --> 01:55:45,552
But I have watched you grow
and develop since then,

979
01:55:45,602 --> 01:55:48,371
both as men and pilots,

980
01:55:48,955 --> 01:55:52,208
and I can say that I am proud
to be your captain.

981
01:55:52,625 --> 01:55:56,170
You have more than exceeded my expectations.

982
01:55:56,879 --> 01:55:58,798
Good luck to you all.

983
01:56:09,100 --> 01:56:11,060
Think you might have dropped that.

984
01:56:16,065 --> 01:56:18,484
I told her I was gonna be a hero.

985
01:56:22,863 --> 01:56:26,909
Look, you got nothing to be ashamed of.

986
01:56:28,828 --> 01:56:33,290
- You went up there and you fought.
- Yeah. Ain't that something?

987
01:56:33,499 --> 01:56:36,418
Hey, you're gonna be all right.

988
01:56:37,169 --> 01:56:39,838
- You're already over the jitters.
- Yeah, jitters.

989
01:56:40,089 --> 01:56:42,883
Yeah. I fixed that.

990
01:56:47,262 --> 01:56:50,683
I tell Thenault I'm gonna go up again
so he won't send me home,

991
01:56:50,683 --> 01:56:52,893
but I don't go back up.

992
01:56:52,893 --> 01:56:57,773
I just watch you guys day after day,
wondering how you do it,

993
01:56:59,858 --> 01:57:02,611
how everybody in my family did it,

994
01:57:06,031 --> 01:57:09,368
why I'm the only one who can't.

995
01:57:11,787 --> 01:57:13,747
All right, Come on.

996
01:57:13,747 --> 01:57:18,248
Why don't you just go?
Go sleep this off and try again tomorrow.

997
01:57:18,298 --> 01:57:20,712
- Yeah, yeah, tomorrow.
- Okay?

998
01:57:20,712 --> 01:57:21,797
Okay.

999
01:57:24,049 --> 01:57:25,300
Okay.

1000
01:57:26,259 --> 01:57:29,596
- We're the knights of the air, remember?
- Yeah.

1001
01:57:31,056 --> 01:57:32,224
- Contact?
- Contact.

1002
01:57:37,104 --> 01:57:41,274
Rawlings, requesting permission
to go on this mission, sir.

1003
01:57:41,483 --> 01:57:44,611
- What's that?
- I rigged this up in the machine shop.

1004
01:57:44,611 --> 01:57:47,239
I can fly with it. Tested it out yesterday.

1005
01:57:47,739 --> 01:57:52,118
All right, but if I feel
you're a detriment to the squadron

1006
01:57:52,118 --> 01:57:54,913
and I wave you off, you go right home,
you understand?

1007
01:57:55,038 --> 01:57:57,832
- Perfectly.
- Don't kill yourself on takeoff.

1008
01:57:57,832 --> 01:58:00,251
Hey, guys, I'm flying!

1009
01:58:09,010 --> 01:58:13,264
Captain Thenault told me I should have it
painted on your plane.

1010
01:58:14,015 --> 01:58:16,017
I hope you don't mind.

1011
01:58:22,982 --> 01:58:24,442
I'm honored.

1012
02:00:21,308 --> 02:00:22,476
Oh, shit.

1013
02:01:34,005 --> 02:01:36,925
Come on, Eddie, do something right.

1014
02:01:47,226 --> 02:01:50,063
Beware the hook!

1015
02:02:30,019 --> 02:02:31,270
All right!

1016
02:02:58,047 --> 02:03:02,009
Congratulations, Beagle. Welcome back.

1017
02:03:03,886 --> 02:03:06,305
I wish Lowry had made it here to see this.

1018
02:03:12,561 --> 02:03:14,521
Where's he going?

1019
02:06:06,984 --> 02:06:10,112
Knights of the air!
