1
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,100
And so DeVanzo stands in.

2
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,200
Six foot first baseman
out of Pawtucket.

3
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,100
fine form on this fellow.

4
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,600
Shot down the line.

5
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,200
That's a frozen rope.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,800
Base hit in anybody's league.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,400
And here's Captain Jeter steps up
to the plate to his usual hip-hop music.

8
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,500
And look at the triceps
on this youngster.

9
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,500
Someone was busy in the Nautilus room
during the off-season.

10
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,200
He'll give the fans a treat
and do a little flexing.

11
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,600
That's right. There're a couple
of actresses on the front row...

12
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,100
that are going out of their minds
right about now.

13
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,300
Yeah!

14
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,600
And sometimes he'll get in there
and just give the fans a treat...

15
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,400
and show them
some of the finer points of hitting.

16
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,700
Fuck!

17
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,600
Absolute pe_ect ten
on this fellow.

18
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,600
Quite a specimen.

19
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:13,000
385 hitter, 23 ding-dongs.
He's driven in 162 runs.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,800
He's 30 sit-ups away from the body
of a young Willie Mays!

21
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,700
And that's a single
up in the middle.

22
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,500
Looked more like a double
play to me, you fat fuck.

23
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,000
What the fuck did you say?

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,500
I said softball's
for girls and faggots...

25
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,100
and girl faggots like you.

26
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,200
You piece of shit!

27
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,700
Mom!

28
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,600
the fat fuck new door
is chasing me again!

29
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,700
Anybody had seen my softball hat?

30
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,500
- Michael?
- Yeah.

31
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,600
- Did you look at these cakes, yet?
- Yeah, yeah. I like that one.

32
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,500
Hey, Marie, Marie, get the hat!
Gina, get the hat!

33
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,300
- You didn't even look?
- Marie, that's not funny!

34
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,500
Okay, you know what?
I'm not being a bitch here.

35
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,400
You're missing
Marie's recital tonight...

36
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,900
and I said we could wait for after the
softball season to go on our honeymoon.

37
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:04,800
I even let you pick
your scumbag friend Artie as best man.

38
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,000
Sweetheart, listen,
it's the first game of the season.

39
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,500
I just don't want to be late,
alright?

40
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,600
I'm with you on the cake.
So I'll look at them later.

41
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,700
You know,
I was gonna surprise you...

42
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,700
by making your little
plastic man on the cake...

43
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,400
a Derek Jeter action figure.

44
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,000
But now, no.

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,900
I'm making you one of those
Puerto Ricans from the fucking Mets.

46
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,600
Don't even joke like that, Gina!

47
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,800
- I'm coming back tomorrow for tanning.
- You better.

48
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,000
Hey! Mark Vicki Galliotta
down as paid up for this month.

49
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,000
And another dumb slut
gets herpes.

50
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,300
Hey! I don't want any of you Italians
drinking out of my water bottle!

51
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,100
Damn Wops.

52
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,000
- Come on, Maz, let's warm up already.
- Don't mess with my pre-game ritual.

53
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,700
Putting on mascara
is not a pre-game ritual.

54
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,800
- Let's go!
- Stop busting my chops, I'm coming.

55
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,800
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

56
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,100
What's up, brother?
Check it out.

57
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,800
- My new Italiano mitt.
- That's cool, Alfonse.

58
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,600
How much of a Guido
can you possibly be?

59
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,000
Fuck you, Johnny.
I'll see you out there.

60
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
- What's up?
- Starting earlier this year?

61
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,600
Ready for the big day,
opening day, big game?

62
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,900
Maz, we stink evey year.
This is not a big game.

63
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,700
- Yes, it is.
- It's not a big game.

64
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,300
Yes, it is. I blew off
my daughter's ballet recital for this.

65
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,000
I've seen your daughter dance.
She sucks.

66
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,300
- No, she doesn't.
- Yeah, she does.

67
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:53,000
- Which one, ballet or tap?
- It all sucks.

68
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,400
- What's up, boys?
- What's up, Manganelli?

69
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,200
So, Maz, how's the wedding coming?
Are you nervous?

70
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,300
I'm doing okay.
Gina's freaking out a little, but...

71
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,700
My cousin is a good kid,
but she can be a real ball-breaker.

72
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,800
What are you going to do?

73
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,100
All right, listen up.

74
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:11,200
Anybody who doesn't do a pre-game shout
with me right now is a fucking pussy.

75
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,800
Jerk off!

76
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,700
Did this jerk off
just call me a jerk off?

77
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:19,500
Come on, let's not ruin another game
with a big fight, all right?

78
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,700
Dave!

79
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,900
Arto.

80
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,400
Fellows.

81
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,400
Dad, I'm thirsty.
Can I have some?

82
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,000
No. Go steal that little kid's soda.

83
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,200
Bro, look at yourself.
You're an unemployed drunk...

84
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,700
you play softball in corduroy
and you still live with your mother.

85
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,700
You shave your body hair,
wear Speedos down the short...

86
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,600
and root for the Dallas Cowboys.

87
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,500
Hey, that's America's team,
asshole.

88
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,400
Not in Jersey, asshole.

89
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,500
We grew up fifteen minutes
from Giant Stadium...

90
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,200
you're a fucking Cowboys' fan?

91
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,200
You're iust iealous.

92
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,400
My softball team won this league
for years in a row...

93
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,800
going on five.

94
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,900
This year you're not getting
that trophy.

95
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,800
No?
Who's going to stop me, you?

96
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,700
In high school,
I was the best baseball player.

97
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,900
You were second best.

98
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,900
I was the best football player.
You were second best.

99
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,700
And, bro, the chicks I got...

100
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,200
were way out of your league.

101
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,200
I did fine.
You fucked skanks.

102
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,300
Skanks?

103
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,800
You're looking at the first guy
to bang Jan Martucci.

104
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,300
Wow, definitely not a skank.

105
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,300
I'm sory.

106
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,200
- Lisa Riccio.
- Monica Nelson.

107
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,800
- Danielle Battaglia.
- Marisa Salvanto.

108
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,700
- Karen Dever.
- Tina Gardner.

109
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,000
- Karen Dever.
- Pinky Calabr...

110
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,600
You iust said Karen Dever.

111
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,200
Well, we did more than once.

112
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,500
Okay, I guess
we're done here, bro.

113
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,500
Because you're out of names,
and I got like fifty more.

114
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,400
I see you on the field, loser.

115
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,100
Yeah, go ahead.
Run away, jerk off.

116
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,100
Run away!

117
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,400
Bring it in!

118
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,900
Now coming to bat
is Artie DeVanzo.

119
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,700
Last season was a fine one
for DeVanzo, we alI know that.

120
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,600
- Come on, Artie.
- He batted. 420 with 45 RBls.

121
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,500
- Come on, Artie.
- Batter up!

122
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,400
He entgrs tDday's game...

123
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,800
with a bl_ alcohol content
of.16.

124
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,300
If you kids are scoring at home, that's
an impressive mice the legal limit.

125
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,300
- Let's get it go, buddy!
- The DeVanzo shift!

126
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,700
What do you say, Art?

127
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:14,500
- Let's go, Artie.
- Let's go, Arto. Let's go!

128
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,100
What's this shit, Manganelli?

129
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,800
It's my new defense strategy.

130
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:22,100
All right side is open for you, Artie.
Go for it, bro.

131
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,100
All right, go the other way
with it, Artie.

132
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,000
He's tying to fool you,
don't be stupid. Come on!

133
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,800
- Come on, Artie!
- Let's go, baby!

134
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,700
Come on now!

135
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,500
Shit!

136
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,200
So, of course, he pulls it.

137
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,300
Hey, the shift works good,
Manganelli.

138
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,100
- Run, Artie, run!
- Artie, run! Run, man!

139
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,700
- Come on, Artie!
- Get it over there!

140
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,100
Out!

141
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:44,800
Nice hustle, Artie.

142
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,900
You're a fat fucking disgrace!

143
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,500
He's a fat guy.

144
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,600
Come on, Dirt.
Start it off, kid. Come on now.

145
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,600
All right, Dirt.
Come on, Dirt.

146
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,000
Lay it in there, baby.
Come on, Dirt. Let's go!

147
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,200
What do you say, Dirt?
You character.

148
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,800
All right, Dirt.
Come on now.

149
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,000
- Shit!
- Jesus Christ!

150
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,700
You disappoint me as much as my kids
for Christ's sake.

151
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,400
Okay, here we go!

152
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,900
Here we go, coming home.

153
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,200
Come on, get it in.
Get it in!

154
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,700
Hit the cut-off man!

155
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,400
Yeah!

156
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,100
Cut-off man!

157
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,900
Cut-off man!

158
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,000
Learn to love him.

159
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,400
- You're killing us!
- The hell are you doing?

160
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:29,100
One second! I'm having a smoke.
What's up your ass?

161
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,400
Cocky prick!

162
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
He's tagging!

163
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,000
No, Dave, don't go!

164
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Hold on!

165
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Come on!

166
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Nice play.

167
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
- Good job.
- You're out.

168
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Good iob.

169
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,500
Come on, let's see it, Dirt.
Let's see it, Dirt.

170
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,800
Fuck, no pitch.

171
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,600
Hey, Tim, I want to let you know...

172
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,600
I've done a lot of thinking about
that talk we had last year.

173
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,300
I don't even know if you remember.

174
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,900
I remember. When I overheard
you telling that joke at the bar, right?

175
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,100
Exactly.

176
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,300
You know,
if we weren't good friends...

177
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,000
I would've handled that
quite differently, right?

178
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,200
Hey, look, just so you know,
I don't even use the ''N'' word anymore.

179
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,900
Like just now, instead of saying the
actual word, I just say the ''N'' word.

180
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,900
I appreciate that, Artie.
That's a good start.

181
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,100
Good for you, man.

182
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,900
That's okay, Dave.
Keep swinging.

183
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,300
As a matter of fact,
listen how I tell this joke now.

184
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,500
A priest, a Rabin and a ''N'' word
walk into a bar...

185
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,500
All right, hold up, hold up,
hold up!

186
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,900
Strike three, you're out!

187
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,600
- That was...
- That's three.

188
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,400
Come on!
Let's get these guy!

189
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,000
Let's get these punk!
He's nothing!

190
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,400
He's an asshole!

191
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,100
A cocksucker!
He's a total piece of shit!

192
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,500
You shut up, fatso.

193
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,700
- Hey, watch the name-calling!
- Come on, Dirt. Let's go now!

194
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,200
Pop up!

195
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,200
- You got it!
- You got it!

196
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,100
- Jesus Christ!
- Shit!

197
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,200
I'm not angy.
Just give me the ball.

198
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,300
You son of a bitch!

199
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,500
Come on, guys.
Let's go.

200
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,500
We look like shit.
Come on.

201
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,400
Hey, DeVanzo...

202
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:09,000
If you're going to ask if you can suck
my left nut the answer is ''maybe''.

203
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,900
Do you ever think
that if I didn't exist...

204
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,600
your life wouldn't suck so bad?

205
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:18,900
We grew up the same age,
in the same town, at the same school.

206
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,300
If I wasn't around,
maybe you could've had what I have.

207
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,400
Wait, I forgot.

208
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:26,500
If I didn't exist,
you'd still be a total fucking jadrool.

209
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:36,200
Come on! Get it in into second!
Come on! Force at second!

210
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,600
Out!

211
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,600
He tripped him, Ump!
He tripped him!

212
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,300
I didn't see it.

213
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,300
- Nice! Way to be!
- Cocksucker!

214
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,400
- Way to be!
- No, no, no!

215
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,400
- Get off of me!
- Come on!

216
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,200
Put his head over here.

217
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,200
Come on!

218
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,100
Don't stretch the shirt.

219
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,000
This guy's such a pussy.

220
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,900
Yeah? I'll La Motta
your face, okay?

221
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,000
Yeah, let's go.
Returning for round two.

222
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,700
Come on, who wants to dance
with me again?

223
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,900
Who's feeling lucky?
You feeling lucky?

224
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,600
You're lucky the cops
showed up, okay?

225
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,300
I'm ready.
I'm not tired.

226
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,800
Who's feeling lucky?

227
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,100
Don't eyeball me,
tough guy.

228
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,200
When I was in the joint,
I fucked guys bigger than you.

229
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,300
What the hell
are we waiting for?

230
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,400
Hey, did Dirt just say
he used to fuck guys?

231
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:36,900
Never mind that.

232
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,600
We're waiting to find out how much
trouble you got us into this time.

233
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,100
Me? He started it.

234
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,100
Alright. Listen up.
First thing's first.

235
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,700
- DeVanzo?
- Yeah?

236
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,800
You're an asshole.

237
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,600
Now, as far as the fighting goes
between you're two guys' teams...

238
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,000
this bullshit will not continue.

239
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,700
It happens evey year...

240
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,200
and it's the first game of the season,
for Christ's sakes.

241
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,700
So, new year...

242
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,500
one of you guys' teams is gonna
have to play in a different league.

243
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,600
What?

244
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,400
Wow, I wonder who you gonna
decide to ask to leave?

245
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,700
I'm not gonna decide, ierk-off.

246
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:19,200
Dennis Manganelli here suggested
you jerk-offs decide it on the field.

247
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,700
Whichever team does better
stays in the league.

248
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,900
The other team is gone new year.

249
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,700
That sucks?

250
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,900
- You gotta be kidding.
- We are so fucked.

251
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,300
I think we could do it.
All we gotta do is practice.

252
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,500
Practice is for fags.
Hey, are we done here?

253
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,100
Because I'm losing my buzz.

254
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,300
In two fucking seconds,
I'm gonna Taser you.

255
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,800
Anybody here who's not an asshole
have a question?

256
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,400
I do.

257
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,300
How come I'm the only one
who's locked up?

258
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,300
Be right with you.

259
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,800
How are we gonna deal with that?

260
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,400
Hey, Linda.

261
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,700
Hey, Artie.

262
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,900
Hey, et me buy you a drink.

263
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,700
No, I can't. I gotta meet my friends
over at Ducky's.

264
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,700
What happened to you?

265
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,100
Oh, this?

266
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,300
I saw three guys mugging
an old lady, so I got involved.

267
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,800
- Really?
- Yeah, she was a tough old broad...

268
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,700
but in the end we got her purse.

269
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,200
Bye-bye.

270
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,000
Good night, Ed.

271
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,900
Hey, Ed.
Get some beers over here.

272
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,100
Whisky.
Come on.

273
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,100
Jesus!

274
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,800
You like you had
the shit kicked out of you.

275
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,900
Yeah? Imagine how
the other guy looks.

276
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:40,300
I imagine a guy completely unharmed
with badly bruised knuckles.

277
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,900
Don't you have livers to ruin?

278
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,100
Totally fucked, this man.

279
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,600
Listen, now that the games
mean something, we'll be great.

280
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,700
This is just gonna help us
play better.

281
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,500
Hey, Maz, do you think you can use
the fight as a reason...

282
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,100
to disinvite Manganelli
from your wedding?

283
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,300
He's Gina's cousin.
He's gonna be there.

284
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,100
And you're my best man,
so, you're gonna be there.

285
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,900
And I'll have no bullshit
from either of you. I fucking swear.

286
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,500
Hey, I'm not one to start trouble.

287
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,500
Oh, my God, you fat fucking liar.

288
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,800
An insane thing to say.
Hello.

289
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,400
Hey, Gina.

290
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,800
Tell her you're still single
for six weeks and hang up.

291
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,400
Yeah. Yeah. I've been thinking quite
a bit about he cakes. Yeah.

292
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,200
Man, is he whipped.

293
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,400
All right.
Now, that Maz is gone...

294
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,800
we can talk a little bit
about his bachelor party.

295
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,600
Now, I've lined up five cousin ''hoors''
for the event.

296
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,700
One of them is called
''The Pitching Machine''.

297
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,700
Now, you're never
in a million fucking years...

298
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,600
eVer 90nna 9UeSS
why she's called that. Go ahead, guess.

299
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,700
She shoots ping pong balls
out of her snatch?

300
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,700
The name gives it away.

301
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,100
Guys, let me ask you a question.

302
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,300
Why do so many diners
have a ''happy waitress'' special?

303
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,800
None of these waitresses
ever seem happy.

304
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,800
It's true.

305
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,300
They should call it
a ''bitchy broad with three kids...

306
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,800
no husband and a shitty
apartment in Linden'' special.

307
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,900
Parts of Linden are nice.

308
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,100
Hey, Rhonda.
I didn't mean anything by it.

309
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,600
But not the part I live in.
What do you guys want?

310
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,800
Let me get a bacon,
egg and cheese on a hard roll...

311
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,100
with side order of fries,
cheese and gra_...

312
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,200
and a bowl of gra_ on the side.

313
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,400
I'll have the same thing
plus pancakes.

314
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,200
- Chocolate milk?
- You know it, honey.

315
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,200
Make it two.

316
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,000
I'll have an egg white omelet
made with vey little oil...

317
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
dy wheat toast
and grapefruit juice.

318
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,500
Oh, my God.
That's the gayest order I ever heard.

319
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,400
In Massachusetts, that order
could legally mary a dude.

320
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,400
Here it comes.

321
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,100
Just placing an order like that
gets you kicked out of the army.

322
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:31,300
If you put a construction helmet on that
order, it could join the Village People.

323
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,800
Would you guys knock it off
so I can do my job?

324
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,100
Thank you.

325
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,600
All right, Maz.
That's an egg white omelet...

326
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,600
dy wheat toast, grapefruit iuice?

327
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,700
That right.

328
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
You want a side order
of cock with that?

329
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,700
We got it in fresh.
It's delicious.

330
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,700
- That people from Linden, I tell you...
- Trust me.

331
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,000
- G_ point.
- Come on!

332
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,000
So, what should we do now?

333
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,100
It's getting late.

334
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,000
Anyone with a job
should go home.

335
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,400
- Good night, Maz.
- Vey funny, ball tugger.

336
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,800
Good night, Johnny.

337
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,500
- Hey, I got an idea.
- What?

338
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,200
- Manhattan!
- What?

339
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,600
- No way. Can't do it.
- Come on.

340
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,800
The bars in the city
are open for four more hours.

341
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,800
Holy shit, it's midnight?
I gotta get home.

342
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,300
That's right, I forgot.

343
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,600
If you're home after midnight,
Gina locks up the pussy.

344
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:26,000
That's not completely true, all right?
Shut up, I'll give you a lift.

345
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,400
Holy shit.

346
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,100
- I'm hungy.
- I'm starving.

347
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,400
Isn't that the chick from the bar?

348
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,500
Oh, yeah!
That's Linda Salvo.

349
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,300
And she looks wasted.

350
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,200
Give me a quarter
you fucking bitch.

351
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,400
- Here, whore.
- Fuck you.

352
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,900
I've seen her in this diner
twice before when she was trashed...

353
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,700
and I banged her both times.

354
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:49,500
Hey, I'm a little tapped.
You got a sawbuck on you?

355
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,400
I usually gotta buy her
a Danish or something.

356
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,100
- All I got is four bucks.
- That'll do it.

357
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,700
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Good luck.

358
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:56,700
Don't need it.

359
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,700
Hey, Linda!

360
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,700
Hi.

361
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,000
What are you broads up to?

362
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:22,900
Artie?

363
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,000
Artie, wake up.

364
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,100
Hey, good morning, Linda.

365
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,100
Artie, I gotta tell you.

366
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,500
That was the worst sex
I have ever had.

367
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:42,300
I'm catching shit from eveybody lately.
What was wrong with the sex?

368
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:46,200
You got all out of breath.
You're like a chubby panda.

369
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:50,000
And then you finish in twenty seconds
and fell asleep on top of me.

370
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,500
It was fucking horrible!

371
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,500
Jesus Christ, I am so pathetic.

372
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:59,000
I get drunk and then I wake up
new to God knows what.

373
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,300
My shrink says that I do it
because I think...

374
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,000
it's the only way a guy
could like me.

375
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,400
Be honest with me, Artie.

376
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,800
The only reason you like me
is because I fuck you.

377
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,400
Not at all.

378
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,600
I mean, it's awesome.

379
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,400
Look, I really like you.

380
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,700
What do you say, you wanna go out
on a regular date or something?

381
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,600
What? Are you serious?

382
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:22,500
Yeah, we could go out,
grab dinner...

383
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,400
and we don't have
to fuck or nothing.

384
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,100
It's vey fucking romantic, Artie.
Are you fucking retard?

385
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,900
Well, do you know what they say
about retards...

386
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:31,300
they have huge cocks
and superhuman strength.

387
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,200
Well, congratulations,
you're definitely not retarded.

388
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:39,600
Look, what I mean is, we could just hang
out and we don't even have to have sex.

389
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,800
Yeah, right.
You're gonna come to my house...

390
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:46,000
in your nice date clothes and pick me up
with like flowers and candies?

391
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,700
Flowers, maybe, but evey time
I buy a chick candy...

392
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,000
somehow, it never makes
all the way to her house.

393
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,000
Come on! What do you say?

394
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,600
All right, Romeo.

395
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,000
It's a date.

396
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,900
Great!

397
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:08,500
And since I'm guaranteed
no sex on the date...

398
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,300
what do you say we take one
for the team right now?

399
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,100
Artie, I'm gonna be late for work!

400
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,400
Come on!

401
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,700
Come on! An e_ra twenty seconds
ain't gonna matter. Come on, baby.

402
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,700
All right.

403
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:23,000
But this time you either gotta put
a rubber on or pull out before you come.

404
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,800
Good morning, Artie.
Ready for breaMast?

405
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,400
Sure, mom.

406
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,500
Hey, this is Linda.

407
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,900
Hello, Linda.
Would you like some breaMast too?

408
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,600
No, thanks.
I'm not hungy.

409
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,000
Can you hand me my jacket,
please?

410
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Thank you.

411
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,300
- Bye.
- Goodbye, Linda.

412
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,500
Take care, Lin.

413
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,800
Hey, mom, sory
if you overheard anything.

414
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,400
- Is that your new girlfriend?
- Why? Do you like her?

415
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,900
I like any girl that likes my Artie.

416
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,000
Although clearly
she's been around the block...

417
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,300
so I would feel better
if you used protection.

418
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,400
Thanks for the advice, mom.

419
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,900
Hey, mom, could you make some
gobblegoo and eggs?

420
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,300
- Come on!
- Hear that! Hear that!

421
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,400
Safe!

422
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,500
- Get them!
- Over there!

423
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,900
Turn two!

424
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,100
- Get them.
- Come on!

425
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,900
- Safe!
- Shithead!

426
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,900
Come on!

427
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,300
Not today, asshole.

428
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,700
Nice shot.

429
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,100
Come on! Come on!
Score!

430
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,300
Come on! Come on!

431
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,600
Go! Go! Go!

432
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,600
Jeez, you're dogging the tying run!

433
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,400
No, I'm not,
I'm standing on the third.

434
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,000
That pile of elephant shit.

435
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,300
- Papa!
- Shit!

436
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,200
Papa!

437
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,600
You're a retard!

438
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,300
That means your mother
must love blowing retards.

439
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,200
- Hey, fuck you!
- Hey, hey, hey!

440
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,100
It's a friend league!
Man, whoa!

441
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,800
- Stop!
- Fat piece of shit.

442
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,900
We're all friends here, Maz,
do something.

443
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,900
- Play the game.
- Get a sense of humor, pal.

444
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,700
I'm impressed, Artie.

445
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,200
This is a really nice place.

446
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,500
Yeah.

447
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,900
That Zagat dude
really knows his shit.

448
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,800
Backed Avedon.

449
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,200
That's me.

450
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,600
- And gnocchi.
- That's me too.

451
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,800
- Thanks, man.
- Alright.

452
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,800
Enioy.

453
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,900
- Take care.
- Thanks.

454
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,000
So where do you work?

455
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,700
At the A&P in Lyndhurst.

456
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,100
This is so odd.

457
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,300
What is?

458
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,600
I mean, we've already slept together
three times, right?

459
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,000
But, I mean,
we barely know each other.

460
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,400
I know.

461
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,900
It's fucking hot, right?

462
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,700
No, it's not.

463
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,700
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

464
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
You work down at the port, right?

465
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,400
I was a longshoreman for nine years,
and then I quit last year.

466
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,200
Haven't had a iob in while.

467
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,100
Why did you quit?

468
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,400
Mainly, my dad.

469
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,000
Why'd your dad want you to quit?

470
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,900
Well, it wasn't like that exactly.

471
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,900
You see, he died.

472
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,200
Oh my God, I'm so sory.

473
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,600
Thanks. I mean...

474
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,700
he had a heart attack on the iob.

475
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:19,100
He installed cable TV for a living.

476
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:22,900
I had to watch him spend evey
waking hour doing a job that he hated.

477
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,900
I mean the only time he was happy
was when someone would tip him...

478
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:28,100
an e_ra twenty bucks to hook up
Cinemax illegally or something.

479
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,400
You know, I can see
why you quit your job.

480
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,100
See, you don't want to like
spend your life...

481
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:38,000
doing something that you hated,
just like your father.

482
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,000
You now what? That sounds great, but the
truth is I'm probably just a lazy prick.

483
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:48,300
You know,
I think you're a cute lazy prick.

484
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:49,700
Thanks.

485
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,700
But I've been doing all the yapping.
What about you?

486
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,400
You got any stories
about your father?

487
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,200
Yeah, I got one.

488
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,400
Once, when I was five years old...

489
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,200
my dad went out to get ice cream
and he never came back.

490
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,500
You serious?

491
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,900
Wow, I'm really sory.

492
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:13,400
Don't be, shit happens.

493
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,300
I can't imagine the pain
you must have been in because of that.

494
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,600
But I think I got a way
to make you feel better right now.

495
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,500
Oh, yeah?

496
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,600
Waiter!

497
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:25,700
Order ice cream for this woman.
Pronto!

498
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:26,900
Oh, God!

499
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,600
You're a fucking idiot, Artie.

500
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,800
You know, I'm gonna have some too.
Waiter, three orders of ice cream.

501
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,000
Come on! What's up?

502
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,300
Come on, Artie,
are you ever serious?

503
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,000
- No, and I tell you why.
- Why?

504
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,400
The only people who get laid
less than funny fat guys...

505
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:43,100
are serious fat guys.
I feel sory for those assholes.

506
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,400
Artie!

507
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,900
Artie, wait.

508
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,600
I thought we weren't gonna
have sex tonight.

509
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,100
I know!
What are you tying to pull here?

510
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,700
Come on, Artie.

511
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,600
Come on, this is important to me.

512
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:04,300
That's cool. Although for
medical reasons I'll need a hand job.

513
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,400
Artie!

514
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:09,400
Come on, I'll be quick.
It'll really help me get to sleep.

515
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,500
I can't mess up this car.
It's a lease.

516
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,600
Hey, I have great aim.
Just let me know where you want it...

517
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,800
ash tray, floor mat, change cup.

518
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,800
All right, listen...

519
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,400
if you're really quick...

520
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,400
I'll give you a blowiob.

521
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,800
But you gotta be quick.

522
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,800
Are you kidding me?
I hear you.

523
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:31,400
When blowjobs go on too long, it's like
you chicks forget guy's dicks get tired.

524
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,900
Stop with the jokes. I gotta be up
for work early tomorrow...

525
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,200
so concentrate, okay?

526
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,100
I'll be Hugh Fucking Downs.

527
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,300
- Who the fuck is that?
- He was the host of ''Concentration''.

528
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,300
Just blow me.

529
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,700
I made tiramisu.
You kids want some?

530
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:49,000
No, mom! Go back inside!

531
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,800
It's in the fridge
if you changed your mind.

532
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,400
Back inside!

533
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,400
Just go! Just...

534
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,500
I am so embarrassed right now.

535
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:59,400
You're embarrassed?
I just got cock-blocked by my mom.

536
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,200
DeVanzo...

537
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,300
landscaping is
a vey strenuous work.

538
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:10,700
Do you think you can handle it? Because
you're not in the best of your shape.

539
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,400
I'll give it a shot. But you better
give me the name of your dietitian.

540
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,400
DeVanzo?

541
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,000
DeVanzo! Wake up!

542
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,200
You got one house left.

543
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,400
Cool!

544
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,300
All right.

545
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,900
Don't tell me is this place.

546
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,800
Hey! DeVanzo?

547
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,500
Hot enough for you?

548
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,700
I think you missed a spot
over there.

549
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,700
And another one over there.

550
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,200
- Out!
- Fuck!

551
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,200
Way to be! Way to be!

552
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,800
Dave, looking good up there.

553
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:49,100
Hey, hey, hey! Don't ty to kill it
up there, all right?

554
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,000
Just get a nice base hit,
we'll start a rally.

555
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,600
Come on, Maz? A home run ties it.
I'm going for it.

556
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,600
Don't be stupid. No one's hit one out
of here since Dave Della Ferra in 1989.

557
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,300
Why don't you think
I can do one too?

558
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:01,900
Because he bench pressed 400 pounds
and you sweat when you eat.

559
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,200
So did Babe Ruth.

560
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,100
The DeVanzo shift, guys.

561
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,100
Meet the ball, Artie.
Come on.

562
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:12,100
Hey, Artie, you guys find
a new league to play in yet?

563
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:15,000
Because one more out, chubs,
and we're 5-O.

564
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,500
You guys are O-5.

565
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,600
Home run coming up.

566
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,600
That would be impressive
after you spent all that energy...

567
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,500
mowing my lawn this afternoon.

568
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,600
I'm actually rooting for you.

569
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,600
Here it comes, Tubby.

570
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,800
And here it goes, prick.

571
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,000
Yes!

572
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,500
- Damn!
-5-O!

573
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,500
5- O, baby! Yeah!

574
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:18,000
DeVanzo, you shithead. Watching you hit
into that double play...

575
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,300
makes me wish
I was 35 years younger.

576
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,200
I know, so you could kick my ass.

577
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,700
No, because I could kick your ass
right now...

578
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:29,200
but 35 years ago, I could have loaned
your parents the money for an abortion.

579
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:40,300
I can't believe you can joke around
like this when you're about...

580
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:42,200
to get us kicked out
of the softball league.

581
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,200
Maybe I should take up bowling.

582
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:47,400
It would be great to play a sport when
there's always a bar three feet away.

583
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,200
So you can get even more drunk
than you do now for softball?

584
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,500
Will you two stop?
We're not out of it yet.

585
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:55,100
Maz, will you face facts?
We're out of it.

586
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,000
we're not playing softball
in this league...

587
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,700
and you daughter
is an atrocious dancer.

588
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:01,500
We're not done.
We can still make the playoffs.

589
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:05,300
Look, I admit that technically
we can still make the playoffs.

590
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:08,200
Now you admit that
your daughter's dancing is a disgrace.

591
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,800
Fuck you, Johnny.
I'm gonna kill you.

592
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,900
Go for it.

593
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:13,200
Maybe growing up
with a father in jail...

594
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,700
will help her dance
with just a hint of passion.

595
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,900
- My man.
- You got it.

596
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,100
Man, that was a tough loss.

597
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:26,000
Yeah, I hate losing
to those fucking Guidos.

598
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,600
Tim, will you watch it
with that word?

599
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,100
- What? Guidos?
- Yeah.

600
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:32,400
Man, you all call each other that
all the time.

601
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,100
Yeah, I know, but it's okay
when we say it.

602
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,000
When you say it, it's racist.

603
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,800
All right, Alfonse.
I respect that.

604
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,400
Wait a minute, I don't respect that.
Guidos aren't a race.

605
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:47,000
You're a bunch of wiggers
who dress like the Sopranos.

606
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,900
Thank you.

607
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:52,500
I appreciate you setting up
the bachelor party...

608
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:55,900
it's just I know you, all right?
No crazy shit. Promise me?

609
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,100
Absolutely not.
Come on, what are you, kidding me?

610
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,100
Eight in the corner.

611
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,000
Hey, Maz, I've been meaning
to ask you a question.

612
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:10,700
I've been seeing this girl Linda
now for a little while...

613
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:13,800
and, I don't know,
she's sort of becoming my girlfriend...

614
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:17,900
and, I tell you what,
I could see things getting serious.

615
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,600
- That's good for you, Art.
- Yeah.

616
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:23,800
But I'm sort of having
this one problem.

617
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,900
Let me guess...

618
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:27,200
you're tying to figure out
how to tell her about the herpes.

619
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,700
No, no, she's got it too.

620
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,700
Congratulations,
you've found your soul mate.

621
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,800
Thanks.
But the thing is this...

622
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,800
She's what most guys would,
I don't know...

623
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,200
charitably call ''used goods''.

624
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,800
Not for nothing, Art,
but you're what most girls...

625
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,000
would charitably call
a ''stinking piece of shit''.

626
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,100
No offense.

627
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,500
I was offended there for a second,
but then you said ''no offense''...

628
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,700
so now eveything is cool.

629
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,600
Anmay...

630
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:56,200
the other day I was talking to her
and I was tying to figure out a way...

631
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,500
to ask her how many guys
she's slept with.

632
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,000
Why would you want to know that?

633
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,800
I don't know, why does any guy want
to know? I just want to know.

634
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:09,000
What I do know is she's been having sex
since she was 15 years old...

635
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,800
so that's 15 years in the league.

636
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:15,600
Conservatively,
she had to put away 25 or 30...

637
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,200
- For what you told me about this girl...
- I know, you're right.

638
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,700
She's gotta be in triple digits.
Anything less, is a lie.

639
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,700
Anything more and I'm gonna pull
my fucking hair out.

640
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:25,100
It's all part of her past.
Why do you let it bother you?

641
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,100
Will you listen to me?

642
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,600
My suggestion
is just drop the whole thing.

643
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,000
I don't think I can.

644
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,900
All right, fine.

645
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,500
If you're gonna ask her,
you gotta be prepared...

646
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,800
to answer the question yourself.
So what's your number?

647
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:42,200
Let's see. I used to be better
at keeping track of this.

648
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,100
Seventy three.

649
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,900
Not counting whores.

650
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:47,800
Six.

651
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,500
You're right,
I'll drop the whole thing.

652
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,700
So mowing the lawns
almost killed me...

653
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,500
but I was making
through the day...

654
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,800
and then the last house turned out
to be that prick Manganelli's.

655
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,800
Oh, no.

656
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:07,600
And then to top it off, he gets me to
hit into a double play to end the game.

657
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,400
It was iust so fucking humiliating.

658
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,200
I'm so sory, honey.

659
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,600
Let's not talk about that asshole.

660
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,000
You know, to tell you the truth,
all the shit with Manganelli...

661
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,200
and us probably getting kicked out
of the softball league...

662
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,300
it's really not bothering that much.

663
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,600
Why not?

664
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,300
I think it's because of you.

665
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,200
Yeah?

666
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,000
Plus right now this weed
is helping out quite a bit.

667
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:44,300
You know, my shrink says
you're really good for my self-esteem.

668
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,900
And out of all the guys I dated,
you're the only one she said that about.

669
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,600
Hey, let's fuck!

670
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,700
Artie, I don't want to wake
your mom up.

671
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:58,600
Come on, don't wory.
My mother went to sleep hours ago.

672
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,200
Artie, I don't know.

673
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,900
Come on! These walls
are completely sound proof.

674
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,500
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah! Of course!

675
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:07,300
- Would I lie to you? Come on!
- No, you wouldn't lie.

676
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,600
You could play drums
in this fucking room.

677
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,500
You could do the solo from Tom Samer
in this fucking room.

678
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,600
Who is Tom Samer?

679
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
It's a Rush song.
It's not important.

680
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,600
All right, I'm almost there.
Almost there.

681
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,800
Just about there.
Almost there. Okay.

682
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,100
Not quite yet. Almost there.
Almost there.

683
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,200
Grab my balls!

684
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,700
Pinch my nipples!

685
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,800
Pinch me in the back!

686
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,400
Harder! Harder!

687
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,500
- That was too hard.
- Like this?

688
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,900
That's it! That's pe_ect.

689
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,700
Artie, wait.
I think the rubber slipped off.

690
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:40,700
Sory!

691
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,500
Oh, no!

692
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,800
Shit!

693
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,400
Nice hit. Nice hit.

694
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:50,800
Way to go, Alfonse!

695
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,400
Yes!

696
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,400
Come on, Art!

697
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,100
Drive me in and we win it, buddy!

698
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,600
Get a hit or I'm gonna shove
that bat up your ass.

699
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,400
- Yeah!
- Vey good!

700
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,600
That's a nice tattoo.

701
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,100
I didn't realize it was
the Chinese word for Guido.

702
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,500
Actually, this is the Chinese symbol
for ''fuck you''.

703
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:15,000
You know, this was great tonight, man.
Getting the first win, huh?

704
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,400
Yeah, was.

705
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,800
Kind of reminds me how
I'm gonna miss playing for this team.

706
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,700
Hey, look, I'm gonna play
with my brother's team out...

707
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:23,500
in Parsippany new year. You want me
to see if they need an infielder?

708
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:26,100
No, get to Parsippany is a pain
in the ass twice a week.

709
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,800
You get traffic, Route 46...

710
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,800
Hey, guys,
it ain't over till it's over.

711
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,900
Artie, you know I'm not the one
who want to give up but...

712
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,100
we're 1-5. It's pretty over.

713
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,400
Way over.

714
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,700
Hello?
Okay, I tell him.

715
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:42,200
Hey, Art. That was Yogi Berra.
He says it's over.

716
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,200
Jerk-off.

717
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:47,400
There's a way to beat
Manganelli's team. We have to...

718
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:51,300
I know what you are going to say, Art.
We gotta blow out Manganelli's fitness.

719
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,000
Dave, how are things at home?

720
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,900
Not good, man.

721
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:03,700
I'm holding in a huge piss,
so could you get to the point, shithead?

722
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,700
All right.
We gotta practice.

723
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,400
Aren't you the one that said
practice is for fags?

724
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,800
Yeah, that's when
you wanted to practice.

725
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,800
Look, this is a beer league.
Nobody practices and that can help us.

726
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,800
I've been hitting softballs
evey day...

727
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,800
and I didn't drink before the game
tonight the first time ever.

728
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,700
I could do that
for the whole season.

729
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:23,500
Look, I'm not saying
it's gonna be easy...

730
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:26,800
Manganelli's team is gonna win
first place for the regular season.

731
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,600
We're gonna have to scratch and claw
and get into second place...

732
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,400
and then beat them
in the championship game.

733
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:34,100
But if we start practicing,
I think we gotta a shot.

734
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:39,200
Fellows, I've been paying softball
for a long time.

735
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,900
This is not the best team
I've ever played on.

736
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,100
But it ain't the worst, either.

737
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:48,400
So, if we would actually
practice evey day...

738
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,800
then, like shithead says,
in this league...

739
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,800
we gotta a shot to win at all.

740
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,800
How about it?

741
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,800
Let's have a toast.

742
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,300
To beat Manganelli!

743
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:01,300
Toast, my ass! I gotta piss so badly
I could drown a horse.

744
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,700
Talk so fucking much.

745
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,700
All right, that put a damper
on the toast.

746
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,700
What do you say
we just practice tomorrow?

747
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:08,700
Salud.

748
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,500
Bounding ball to the grindaloon
at third. He's got it.

749
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,400
All right. We haven't turned
a double play in like three years...

750
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:22,500
so let's get two.
Come on. Artie is here now.

751
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,500
Let's get two.

752
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,100
Good effort! Good effort!
Way to go! Way to go!

753
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,100
Damn!

754
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,900
You assholes know
I'm being sarcastic, right?

755
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,100
Come on. Let's get two.

756
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,400
- Damn!
- Ty not to spread your legs...

757
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,900
like a two buck hooker.

758
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Good, Maz!
When you wait it on like that...

759
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,300
you don't have to lunge for the ball.
All right. Way to be.

760
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:56,400
Now, Johnny, I noticed you've been
dropping your front shoulder.

761
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,500
Wait a minute,
you're telling me how to hit?

762
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,600
Please, I'm batting.687.

763
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,400
It's like telling Ted Williams
how to hit.

764
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:06,200
Really? I always thought of you
as more like a Pete Rose type.

765
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,300
You know, a shitty gambler
with bad hair.

766
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,500
Hit it!

767
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,100
Jesus Christ! It's like a bunch
of monkeys tying to screw a football.

768
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:25,600
Nice hit, Tim.
Way to be. Beautiful.

769
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,800
You know, Dave,
you might be a lefty.

770
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:32,900
Yeah.

771
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,400
Let's get two.
Come on!

772
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,200
What the fuck are you doing?

773
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,400
Jump!

774
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,900
Second base is over there, moron!

775
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:48,300
Sory, Johnny. I...

776
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,900
Jesus Christ!

777
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,100
That is iust amul.

778
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:56,900
Really?

779
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:59,400
- I thought I hit that pretty good.
- No, your hitting is fine.

780
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,500
I'm talking about
that disgusting Guido pink shirt.

781
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,600
Go home and change it.

782
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,200
All right, technically,
this is fuchsia.

783
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,000
Out of my sight! Go!

784
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,300
I'm gonna throw up.

785
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:11,400
- Jesus Christ!
- I'm going to see my brajool.

786
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,900
- Let's get two.
- Come on, fellows.

787
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,300
Come on!

788
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,000
- Yeah!
- All right!

789
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,900
That's what I'm talking about.
Come on now!

790
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:26,300
Now do that again and prove
that was not just luck.

791
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,300
Let's do this.

792
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,600
Great.
Get two now. Two.

793
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,600
Come on now!

794
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,600
- Yeah!
- That's what I'm talking about.

795
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,400
- All right!
- Way to be!

796
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,800
- That's the way to do it.
- Way to be! Way to be!

797
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,300
Come on now, folks!

798
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,500
Come on, good, Guido.

799
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,700
Eveybody hits.

800
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,600
- Run, Artie!
- Slow down, asshole.

801
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,000
One hopper, DeVanzo.
he's got it.

802
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,000
- Out!
- Yeah!

803
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,600
Throw to first!

804
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:11,200
- Out!
- Nice, Art. Way to pick it.

805
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,200
How about it? How about it?

806
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:16,500
- Good play.
- Nice.

807
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:19,300
- Way to be.
- Don't get cocky, fucknuts.

808
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,800
All right, let's go.
No stick up here.

809
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,500
No stick? Hey, Crispino,
what's your batting average?

810
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:27,300
Fuck you, Johnny. Who keeps that
in slow pitch softball?

811
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,600
I'm hitting.687.
Thank you.

812
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,100
Nice shot!

813
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,200
Strike three!

814
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:37,200
Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!

815
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,800
Nice catch!

816
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,400
- Look at you!
- All right.

817
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,700
What do you say now? Here we go.
Turn it now. Come on!

818
00:38:58,700 --> 00:38:59,700
I'm on it, Johnny.

819
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,200
Out!

820
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,300
.463. Nice.

821
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:07,400
No carbs. Lobster,
prime rib, those little clams.

822
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,500
Whatever you want.
Want to drive?

823
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,900
- Yeah!
- I don't think so.

824
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:14,800
What the fuck!?

825
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,800
DeVanzo, you motherfucker!

826
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,100
Way to hit it, man.
Nice shot!

827
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,200
Yeah!

828
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,500
- That's right!
- All right!

829
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,600
- Congratulations!
- Nice shot!

830
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:32,200
Ten to five, baby!
Ten to five!

831
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:33,900
Nice shot!

832
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,700
Step right up and shoot the geek.
One hundred shots for five dollars.

833
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:55,100
Oh, my God! Yeah!
This is getting ugly.

834
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,600
- All right.
- Artie, knock it off!

835
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,900
- Get him in his balls.
- Okay.

836
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:03,900
Get his balls.

837
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:08,700
On theses wheels I bet on Mom
evey single time.

838
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:10,400
Because I love my mom, you know?

839
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,100
- That's so cute.
- Thanks.

840
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,800
All right.
Come on, ''Mom''!

841
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,800
- Come on, ''Mom''!
- Come on! ''Mom'', what do you say?

842
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,100
Come on, ''Mom''!

843
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:19,200
One time with ''Mom''.
Just one time.

844
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,800
Come on, motherfucker ''Mom''!

845
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,800
Motherfucker! Hit ''Mom''!
Motherfucker! Come on, ''Mom''!

846
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,900
Fuck! Fuck! Shit!
Cock! Fuck!

847
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:29,700
Mothe_ucker! Let's get away
from this crooked fucking game.

848
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:39,300
It's hard to say
because I totally believe in God...

849
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:41,800
but I have lots of problems
with the Church.

850
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,300
I don't think I want to be married
in a church...

851
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:46,400
because I would feel like
a total hypocrite.

852
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,800
I sort of feel the same way, you know.
I'm not religious at all...

853
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,900
but my mother
went to Catholic school...

854
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:56,900
so, you know, she would really want me
to get married by a priest.

855
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,900
So I thought
of this great compromise.

856
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:00,400
If I ever get married...

857
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:04,200
it's going to be by a justice of
the peace who's also a child molester.

858
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:08,200
You're so going to hell for that.

859
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,300
What? Come on!

860
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:16,500
Five dollars, hotshot!
Where are you going? Knock it out.

861
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,600
You know where you mother is?
She's waiting to pick me up.

862
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,600
Five dollars. Purple monkey.

863
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:24,100
What's up, slugger? Five bucks.
Yours, baby. Purple monkey.

864
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:26,500
- Purple monkey, man!
- All right, Artie, you can do it!

865
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,100
Purple monkey, man!

866
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,900
All right, baby.
That's a good start.

867
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:32,900
Gotta have to settle
for a pink bear, man.

868
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,600
- Pink bear, man!
- Come on, baby.

869
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,600
You got nothing!

870
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Nothing!

871
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:40,600
- All right.
- Dude!

872
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,100
I got the look.

873
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,900
- This is going to be the one, right?
- Purple monkey!

874
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,700
Because he ain't going
to get it today.

875
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,900
Loosing his hair,
down on his luck...

876
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,600
perhaps too fat for his age.

877
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:53,300
He's with a hot chick
who is clearly out of his league.

878
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:55,800
Forget about it. I don't even want
one of those stupid purple monkeys.

879
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:59,200
No, on this one, I'm getting you
a prize. I guarantee, all right?

880
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,000
- Okay.
- Here, catch, douche!

881
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:35,000
Marie, you're a beautiful dancer.

882
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,100
Atrocious.

883
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:41,200
- Johnny!
- Unwatchable.

884
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,700
- Stop it!
- It's amul.

885
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:44,900
- Lovely.
- No, it's not lovely.

886
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:47,500
Someone's gotta tell her.
She stinks.

887
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,900
Look, I don't know what Artie
has planned for this bachelor party...

888
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,900
Honey, it's no big deal, all right?
Johnny, you ready?

889
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:54,700
And I don't want to know,
it's just my father might stop by...

890
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:56,000
- for a little while.
- I know.

891
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
And if he does,
would you please show some respect?

892
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Absolutely.

893
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,300
Don't wory about nothing.
I'll bring him back in one piece.

894
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:01,500
- You see?
- Come on.

895
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:02,700
All right, honey,
I'll see you later.

896
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:04,800
Whatever.

897
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:06,500
All right, let's go.

898
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:11,300
Gina, relax.

899
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:13,600
They alI have bachelor parties.
It's no big deal.

900
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:18,500
Marie, stay away from the street,
sweetheart. Just dance on the lawn.

901
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:22,400
Marilyn, it's not the bachelor party
that I'm worried about, you know...

902
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,500
it's just I can't relax when I know
he's going out with fuckhead.

903
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:26,700
You mean Artie?

904
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:28,700
Did you know that at
Carol Monteverdi's wedding...

905
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:30,800
he got drunk and he punched
the deejay in the face...

906
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,300
because the guy wouldn't play
''Rock Me, Amadeus''?

907
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:36,400
Well, we aI know
he's kind of pathetic...

908
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:40,000
but I like Artie, and I don't think
he's quite so obnoxious any more.

909
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,600
The 2-2 pitch to Birkenstock.

910
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,300
Yeah!

911
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:47,000
Down the line!
He may have it!

912
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,500
It's got the foul pole!

913
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:49,400
Home run!

914
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:50,600
Nice shot.

915
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,100
Hey, no!

916
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,200
Scavooch, what the fuck?

917
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:20,100
And the crowd is going crazy
here at Bush Stadium.

918
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:25,300
And DeVanzo is looking to lace
one back through the hole.

919
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,200
A little chin music.

920
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,900
And he may charge the round.

921
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:35,300
That's okay, it's cool. If I have to,
I'll snort the fucking rag.

922
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:39,200
- Tone that spitter, honey.
- Come on, let's take a look at that.

923
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:44,300
You got to have that.

924
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:46,300
Wait, you almost fucked us up
over here.

925
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:48,800
- Dude, you got to catch that.
- I'm not catching that shit.

926
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:55,100
- He's got his own stick.
- This is going to be a good one.

927
00:44:58,300 --> 00:44:59,700
Pete LeCock!

928
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:01,100
Salud!

929
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:02,700
- Salud.
- Drink this.

930
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,400
- Salud!
- Salud more!

931
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,600
- You're tying to kill me here.
- Come on, one more. I love you.

932
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:26,400
- Fuck, cops.
- Shit!

933
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,800
What the fuck is going on in here?

934
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,400
Eveybody freeze.

935
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:40,000
- Shit!
- Hey, you son of a bitch!

936
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:42,800
Hey, look at him.
Hey, relax, guys.

937
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:44,600
Hey.

938
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,000
This is my cousin Mickey.

939
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,400
He's a Boston cop.

940
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:51,500
Funny.

941
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:58,200
Scared the shit out of you all Derek
Jeter-loving motherfuckers, didn't l?

942
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:00,700
Hey, man, have a drink.
Have some fun.

943
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:02,300
- Sure, Maz.
- Thanks for coming.

944
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:04,300
Hey, black man.
Hook me up with some coke, will you?

945
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,700
Want a slice there,
Pitching Machine?

946
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:10,400
No, I don't eat daiy.

947
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,300
The Pitching Machine
doesn't eat daiy.

948
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,300
A lot of rules.

949
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:16,300
Fuck you, ho.
You ain't taking money out of my pocket.

950
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:18,000
Fuck you, bitch.
I saw him first.

951
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,900
You're the one taking money
out of my pocket.

952
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:21,400
Come on, ladies.

953
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:23,800
Neither if you even have pockets.

954
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:30,400
Honey, your prices are outrageous.

955
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:34,100
I remember when a man could get
his cock clean for five bucks.

956
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:37,900
I'll clean your cock for five bucks,
but a blowjob is still fifty.

957
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:39,900
Let me call my wife.

958
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,500
Hey, there he is.

959
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:45,600
- Dennis.
- How do you feel?

960
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,800
Did you come in a convertible?

961
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:49,200
Don't be iealous.

962
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:51,200
- Get a drink.
- All right.

963
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:52,900
Have a good time.
It's your last chance.

964
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:56,400
Hey, Ed, what is
the ''Elect Zinna'' bullshit?

965
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:58,800
Fucking bitch.

966
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,600
What happened to you?

967
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:11,200
While I was getting a blowjob the other
whore punched my whore in the mouth.

968
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:14,100
You better ice that shit, money.

969
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:20,800
Hey, thanks so much
for putting this together.

970
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,000
I'm having a fucking great time.

971
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,700
Don't wory about it, brother.

972
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:27,900
Hey, listen,
Manganelli just showed up.

973
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:29,300
Yeah, I saw him.

974
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:31,000
No fight, please.

975
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:32,600
I promise!

976
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:35,200
Listen, Maz, I'm in a vey
different place right now.

977
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:38,100
- I really don't care about Manganelli.
- That's what I want to hear.

978
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:39,300
- All right?
- That's great, Artie.

979
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:45,100
Okay, now, all hoors front and center!
Time to rape the bachelor! Come on!

980
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:47,900
I'm not doing it!
I'm not doing it!

981
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:50,200
- I'm not doing it!
- Tough shit. You're doing it!

982
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:54,800
- Have at him, ladies.
- You're a liar, you motherfucker.

983
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,400
No! Please!

984
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,600
Maz is getting his pipes cleaned.

985
00:47:58,600 --> 00:47:59,900
Hang in there, Maz.

986
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:01,700
Maz, you're down
for the count, bro.

987
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:04,300
Jesus Christ.
Artie? Artie? Artie?

988
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:06,200
Hey, I'm a little busy right now.

989
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:08,300
I thought you said
you're not gonna do coke anymore.

990
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:10,200
Bachelor parties don't count.

991
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:12,200
Asshole, it's Gina's father.

992
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,100
I would rather not be naked
in front of my friends right now.

993
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:19,700
Shit. He looks pissed.
I was hoping he'd be cool.

994
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:22,200
You know, like your father was
in your bachelor party.

995
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:23,800
Yeah, he was the best.

996
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:26,300
I can't believe I walked in on him
getting a hummer.

997
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:27,300
What?

998
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:28,900
Nothing.

999
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,200
Hey, this dude looks like he's going
to freak out. I better go talk to him.

1000
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:36,000
I'm supposed to go to confession
new week.

1001
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:42,700
Cheap shit.

1002
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:48,400
I don't know if you guys know this,
but I'm getting married vey soon.

1003
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,700
Hello, sir.

1004
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:52,900
No, please!
I have a child.

1005
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:56,100
I have a five-year-old.
Wow!

1006
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,700
Boy, Maz has a big cock.

1007
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:02,700
I'm going to kill you,
you motherfucker!

1008
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:04,200
He's got no respect for his elders.

1009
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:07,100
Get off him!

1010
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:10,200
What the fuck is the matter
with you? Get off him!

1011
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:17,400
Hey, thanks for letting me
do bumps with you.

1012
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:19,200
You want that blowiob now?

1013
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:20,700
No, I'm good.

1014
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:23,400
That's a first.

1015
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:26,200
She must be pretty special.

1016
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:28,400
Yeah, she is.

1017
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:30,500
Bye.

1018
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:31,400
Take care.

1019
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,600
Art, Maz is pissing all over himself
behind the bar.

1020
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,400
Well, it's not a bachelor party
unless somebody pisses his pants.

1021
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,500
Actually, he managed
to get it out of his pants.

1022
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:48,200
Look, Maz, I know I owe you
for that time you helped me out...

1023
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:51,400
when I shit my pants on Mardi Gras,
but now we're even, man.

1024
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:54,200
Wow! How much did you drink,
motherfucker?

1025
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:57,300
Jesus Christ, Maz!
Maz!

1026
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:02,000
All right, it looks like the well
is running dy finally.

1027
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,900
Now, if you could just get your dick
back to your pants on your own...

1028
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:06,900
eveything will be fine,
all right, man?

1029
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:09,300
Hey, DeVanzo.

1030
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:13,300
I know why you're here,
but I'm not letting you blow Maz.

1031
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:14,800
Of course not.

1032
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,900
That's your job,
you son of a bitch.

1033
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:20,300
In case you haven't notice,
the party is over. Get out.

1034
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:23,900
All right, I'm going.
Say hi to Linda for me.

1035
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:25,500
What?

1036
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:29,100
Linda Salvo, your girlfriend.

1037
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:32,200
She didn't tell you
she used to go to my gym?

1038
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:33,200
No.

1039
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,500
Yeah. Cute girl.

1040
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,900
She earned quite a few free
membership months in my office...

1041
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:40,000
if you know what I mean.

1042
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,000
Anmay, say hi to her for me.

1043
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:32,600
Hey, honey.

1044
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:38,300
You look like
you haven't slept a wink.

1045
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:41,100
I taped the Yankee game for you.

1046
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:42,000
Thanks.

1047
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:46,900
So, were you naughty
at the bachelor party?

1048
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:49,600
Actually, I wasn't.

1049
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:55,200
Linda, I have something important
I want to ask you.

1050
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:57,500
Really? What is it?

1051
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:59,100
Did you fuck Manganelli?

1052
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:04,400
Artie...

1053
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,700
Just answer the question, please.

1054
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:09,200
Look, I don't want to talk
about this, okay?

1055
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:12,000
I just... No matter what you think,
it's not important.

1056
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,700
Could you just answer
the fucking question, please?

1057
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:17,200
All right.

1058
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:19,100
The answer is yes.

1059
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:20,100
Fuck!

1060
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:21,600
How could you?

1061
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:23,700
Artie, it was over two years ago!

1062
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:26,400
Right, and I had to hear about it from
him. Why couldn't you tell me yourself?

1063
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:29,600
How could I? You're completely
consumed with this guy.

1064
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:32,100
You're finally just starting
to get over it.

1065
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:34,000
Look, I don't think
about this jerk...

1066
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,000
and I don't want you to think
about him either. All right?

1067
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,300
I just want us to be happy
like we are.

1068
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,500
Come on.

1069
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:46,000
This is too fucked up.
I don't think I can handle it.

1070
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:49,700
What do you mean you don't think
you can handle it?

1071
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:52,700
What?
You want to break up over this?

1072
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:55,600
You know what?
Yeah, I do.

1073
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:59,200
Are you fucking kidding me?

1074
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:01,900
Over something that happened
years before I met you?

1075
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:05,700
You feel bad so now you want
to make me feel bad too, right?

1076
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
God, you're iust...

1077
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,800
You're not a man!
You're a fucking little bitch.

1078
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:12,500
God, you're fucking unbelievable!

1079
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:14,400
I could fucking kill you!

1080
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:17,100
Damn Yankees fuck ass!

1081
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:18,700
Nasty loser ass!

1082
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:23,100
Take your stinking
loser jersey too!

1083
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:25,400
Fat fuck! Fucking asshole!

1084
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:29,500
Can I get some more fries here,
Rhonda?

1085
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:33,700
You know, women who date fat guys
are often mentally unstable.

1086
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:35,600
Yeah, it's true.

1087
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,600
They call them ''chubby chasers''.

1088
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:40,700
- Rhonda, I'm still here.
- One order of fries coming up.

1089
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:50,100
Asshole! Asshole!

1090
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:51,400
Asshole!

1091
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:55,400
I'm telling you,
this chick is good for Artie.

1092
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:58,200
- I got my own problems.
- Thanks for the free bat, asshole.

1093
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:03,600
Hey, Art, you know what?
You can't hold this on this chick now.

1094
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:05,400
I mean I know it's a pain in the ass
to deal with it...

1095
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:07,300
I can't deal with it. It's over.

1096
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:09,500
This is the first chick
you've ever been serious about.

1097
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:12,300
Come on, you finally met a broad
who doesn't care about your drinking...

1098
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:15,400
or the fact you're 35 years old
and you still live with your mom.

1099
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:18,800
And she doesn't mind that a man with
your weight should be about 6'2''.

1100
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,700
Plus you factor
in the herpes thing and...

1101
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:22,000
Asshole!

1102
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Enough!

1103
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:24,500
Me and her are through.

1104
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,600
So now who are you going to take
to my wedding...

1105
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:28,700
if there is one?

1106
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:31,100
What do you mean
if there still is one?

1107
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:34,700
You know, Art, I asked you not to let
things get crazy at the bachelor party.

1108
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:36,700
Now I got to be worried,
you know?

1109
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:39,100
I'm afraid Gina's father is going
to tell her what went on there.

1110
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:41,200
No, he's not.

1111
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:42,200
Yeah, how do you know?

1112
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:44,500
He's not going to break
the bachelor party code.

1113
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:48,000
No man tells a woman what goes on
at a bachelor party.

1114
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:51,000
So what happened
at Michael's bachelor party?

1115
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,400
Nothing.

1116
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,500
So what went on
at Maz's bachelor party?

1117
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:55,400
Nothing.

1118
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:57,700
So what went on
at the bachelor party?

1119
00:54:57,700 --> 00:54:58,700
Nothing, baby.

1120
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:02,700
We've been married for 43 years and
you still won't tell me what goes on...

1121
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:04,800
at one bachelor party?

1122
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,300
Fuck off.

1123
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:11,200
No, I'm going to be honest
with Gina.

1124
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,900
I'll feel better
if I just tell her what happened.

1125
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:15,800
- Are you fucking insane?
- No, no, no, asshole!

1126
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:18,600
Evey once in a while, some moronic
pussy does spill the beans...

1127
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:19,700
and it's always a disaster.

1128
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,300
Forgive me!
Please, don't go!

1129
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:23,700
I'll die without you!

1130
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:25,100
Get away from me,
you whore-lover.

1131
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:27,600
You said you watched porno so you
wouldn't have to do things like that.

1132
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:29,100
Look, I wish I hadn't done it...

1133
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:31,900
but I'm insecure and it feels like
it's going to fall off.

1134
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:35,200
If it doesn't, give me a call
and I'll come back and I'll cut it off!

1135
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:37,800
Cut what off, mommy?

1136
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,900
- I know. I know.
- Here he comes, here it goes.

1137
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:43,500
It's a pe_ect day for softball
here at the stadium.

1138
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:46,400
55 thousand on hand
for Johnny Trinno.

1139
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:49,400
Bobblehead Day here.
I mean it's a great day for the kids.

1140
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:51,400
All fans 16 and under will get one.

1141
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:54,200
And can Johnny go
for the.700 batting average?

1142
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:56,800
- Do you ever shut the fuck up?
- No, I don't.

1143
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:58,200
.698.

1144
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:01,000
- Nice one, baby!
- Go, Johnny!

1145
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,500
- Come on, Artie.
- Big stick, Artie.

1146
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:05,900
Would you look at Artie.
You know, he really thinks who he is.

1147
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:08,800
Fucking best man at my wedding.
And he better behave.

1148
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:10,900
Gina, you've got to stop.
Stop worying.

1149
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:12,900
- Marilyn, stop worying?
- Yeah.

1150
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:14,600
Did you know that
at Donna Delvecchio's wedding...

1151
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:17,500
he pissed in the centerpieces
and got the priest high?

1152
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:20,100
Okay.

1153
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:22,700
Oscar Gamble stile, baby.

1154
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:26,800
Way to go, fuckhead.

1155
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:30,000
Yeah!

1156
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:31,900
Yes, Artie!

1157
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:33,300
Way to go, Artie.
I knew you could do it, pal.

1158
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:34,300
We did it!

1159
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:36,800
So back during
college basketball season...

1160
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:39,000
my buddy Scheky tells me
he's got this system.

1161
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,400
He says it's an absolute lock
when you have this combination, right?

1162
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:45,000
Big East team on the road...

1163
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,500
give them less than six points
with a white point guard, all right?

1164
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:51,300
So I bet St. John's against Duke
and I lose big...

1165
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:52,600
I mean, really big, right?

1166
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,200
So I said to Scheky,
I go, ''Look, man...

1167
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:56,500
the only time a white point guard
is a good thing...

1168
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:59,000
is when your sister tells you
she's dating a point guard.''

1169
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,300
Hey, Tim,
I didn't see you there, man.

1170
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:07,900
That's a funny ioke, man.

1171
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:09,600
You like that ioke?

1172
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:11,600
Yeah, what's not to like about it?

1173
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:13,400
It's about how you guys suck
at basketball...

1174
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:14,800
and how good we fuck
your women.

1175
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:17,600
I never thought about it like that.

1176
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:22,900
- We got a better lineup than they got.
- Totally.

1177
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:25,000
That's why they slacked off
the second half.

1178
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,400
He got the champagne...

1179
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:28,800
- Hey, guys!
- Hey!

1180
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:32,000
- What's up? How you doing?
- Hey, Art, listen to this.

1181
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,400
Carino Autobody lost to
Muchugrasso Overhead Doors...

1182
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,300
so now we're tied for second
with Carino.

1183
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:39,000
- Hey, our last game is against Carino!
- That's right.

1184
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,900
It's going to come down
to the last day here.

1185
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:44,200
Does Ed's Bar and Swill win the right to
face Manganelli in the championship...

1186
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:45,700
and save the team?

1187
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:47,400
Or perhaps even more dramatic...

1188
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:50,500
does Joking Johnny Trinno
bat.700?

1189
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:54,100
Asshole, will you forget about
your batting average for one second?

1190
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:56,200
We gotta beat
that prick Manganelli.

1191
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:59,200
Artie, what exactly do you have
against my cousin?

1192
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:01,900
Well, number one, he's a prick.
Number two, he's a cock.

1193
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:03,100
Number three, he's a dick.

1194
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:06,100
Congratulations, you know
three different words for ''penis''.

1195
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:07,900
Four, now that
you taught me ''penis''.

1196
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,600
All right, guys, relax, okay?
Does anybody need a drink?

1197
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:12,900
- Eveybody be nice.
- All right, let's change the subject.

1198
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:17,300
Artie, are you bringing Linda to the
wedding or are you guys still broken up?

1199
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:19,200
No, we're broken up for good.

1200
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:21,900
You know, Gina actually offered
to set you up with one of her cousins.

1201
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:25,200
Hey, great! I heard your cousin
Manganelli gives a mean blowjob.

1202
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:27,900
You know what, Artie?
You sit on this and rotate.

1203
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:30,800
Gina, your flirting is making eveyone
at the table uncomfortable.

1204
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:33,700
Come on, Art, take it down a notch.
she's just tying to help you.

1205
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:36,000
Hey, I'm not some loser
who can't get a...

1206
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,400
Wait, you're not talking about
your cousin Tracy with the tits?

1207
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:40,300
No, Tracy's married now,
thank you.

1208
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:44,300
Hey, I'm not some loser who can't get
a date! I'm doing just fine on my own.

1209
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:47,000
Hello, is Karen Denver there?

1210
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:49,800
Karen? It's Artie DeVanzo!

1211
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:52,600
Yeah, Artie, from Union High!

1212
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,700
That's right, we haven't spoken
since I took you to the prom.

1213
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:59,500
That's right, I did call you
from jail after.

1214
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:04,100
Well, listen, I was just sitting
in the office here...

1215
00:59:04,100 --> 00:59:06,900
and I was wondering...
Do you remember my friend Maz?

1216
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:09,700
Yeah, well, he's getting married
this weekend...

1217
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:11,600
and I was wondering
if you want_ tD go with me.

1218
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:15,300
Yeah, I was remembering
all the fun times we used to have.

1219
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:18,300
What do you mean ''what fun''?

1220
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:20,700
By my count, we banged
at least 26 times. Hello?

1221
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:25,200
No kidding, Gigi.
You're strictly into chicks now?

1222
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:28,000
Hey, did I have something
to do with that?

1223
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:29,900
I did?

1224
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:34,300
So then you got divorced
from that guy too?

1225
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:36,100
Boy, Brenda, you really know
how to pick them.

1226
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,300
I'm iust teasing you.

1227
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:42,100
Yeah, yeah, thanks.
It's really great to talk to you too.

1228
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:45,100
I'm so glad that nerd at the libray
taught me how to Google.

1229
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:46,800
Listen, let me tell you
why I'm calling...

1230
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:49,400
You know already? Really?

1231
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:55,800
Right, I did tell you l'd pay you back
that 200 bucks I borrowed from you...

1232
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:57,300
no matter how long it took.

1233
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:04,000
Hi, this is Linda.

1234
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,100
I can't come to the phone right now,
so, please, leave me a message.

1235
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:09,600
Hey, it's Artie.

1236
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:12,400
I know we haven't talked in awhile,
so this is kind of aw_ard...

1237
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:13,500
but...

1238
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,800
Look, eveything was my fault.

1239
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:18,700
I know I get crazy sometimes
you know and...

1240
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:20,300
well...

1241
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,000
I don't know, listen...

1242
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:25,300
I'm going to stop talking into your
machine before this gets embarrassing.

1243
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:26,800
Give me a call if you get a chance.

1244
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:28,800
But I miss you.

1245
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:29,900
I miss you a lot.

1246
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:31,200
Bye.

1247
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:34,000
So, you're going to call him?

1248
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:37,400
I don't know.

1249
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:40,300
I mean I still really care about Artie,
but he really hurt me.

1250
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:46,500
Either way, keep this quiet,
because it was a big mistake.

1251
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:48,200
Why? Because I'm black?

1252
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:50,600
No, because
you're fucking married!

1253
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:53,200
All right, my bad.

1254
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:57,400
What do you say now, Dave?

1255
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:58,900
Hang in there.

1256
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:01,100
- Hang in there.
- Land her, baby.

1257
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:03,800
Nice and easy. Nice and easy.
Bring the ball. Come on, Dave.

1258
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:05,400
Run him on now.
Come on!

1259
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:07,100
Strike three!

1260
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:09,200
Oh, my God! I can't wait
to go home and get high!

1261
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:10,400
Holy shit.

1262
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,600
Some of the greats
strike out, Dave.

1263
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:16,600
That's right, striking out in slow pitch
softball is nothing to be ashamed of.

1264
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:18,400
All right, Johnny.
All right, Johnny!

1265
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:20,200
It's all you, baby!
Bring me in.

1266
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:23,500
Two outs here in the last inning,
with the winning run on second.

1267
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:26,400
Who would you want up more
than Johnny Trinno?

1268
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:28,300
It's been a magical year
for Johnny...

1269
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:31,900
as he comes to the last game
with a.699 average.

1270
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:33,600
All right, come on,
it's getting dark.

1271
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:36,500
Yet Trinno's star shines
as bright as ever.

1272
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:38,900
Nice hit, Johnny!
That's it.

1273
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:41,600
Come on, Maz, go!
Screw your slide!

1274
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:43,900
Go, come on, slide, slide!

1275
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:46,700
Your slide! Head for a slide!
Head for a slide!

1276
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:50,400
Shit.

1277
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:52,300
What did you slide for?
They didn't even throw the ball.

1278
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,500
Why the helI did you tell me
to slide?

1279
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:59,800
I was just fucking with you.
We're in the championship!

1280
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,800
Listen, Johnny, I don't have a date
for the wedding yet.

1281
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:15,100
What? I thought you took care ofthat.
The wedding is this afternoon.

1282
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:18,400
I know, I struck out all over the place.
Hey, do you think Marilyn...

1283
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:20,600
could get one of her friends
to go with me last minute?

1284
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:26,100
Look, Art, Marilyn's female friends are
all lawyers, bankers and executives...

1285
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:29,500
So what are you saying,
that they're too good for me?

1286
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:32,800
No, no, I was tying to let
the silence say it for me.

1287
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:35,600
Artie, even if Marilyn could help you,
it's too late.

1288
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:38,600
Nobody cares if you have a date.
Just come by yourself.

1289
01:02:39,100 --> 01:02:42,500
I can't do that, Johnny.
That's all right, man.

1290
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:44,400
I still got one chick left
I could call.

1291
01:02:58,300 --> 01:03:00,400
It's almost time to get it started.
Where the hell is Artie?

1292
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:03,200
I just called the house. His mom said
some girl came and picked him up.

1293
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:05,000
What the...?
I don't believe this shit!

1294
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:11,900
Look, Johnny, if this scumbag
isn't here in five minutes...

1295
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:14,600
we start without him.
You step in as best man.

1296
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:15,600
Yes, sir.

1297
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:23,000
That's so sad that you
and your girlfriend broke up.

1298
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
You're such a sweetie.

1299
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,800
Here. You want a bump
to cheer you up?

1300
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:29,100
No, that's all right.
Maybe later.

1301
01:03:29,100 --> 01:03:31,100
You know you just flew through
a stop sign, right?

1302
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:36,100
Who are you to talk, silly?
You don't even have a driver's license.

1303
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,900
Well, at least
we're making good time.

1304
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:40,800
All right, the church is like
two minutes from here...

1305
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:42,600
so, just go straight,
but slow down.

1306
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,900
Slow down! Slow down!
Pitching Machine, look out!

1307
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,300
I saved us!

1308
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:55,200
Yeah, you're a real hero.

1309
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:56,900
Come on, let's go.

1310
01:03:56,900 --> 01:03:58,400
Wait, let me powder my nose.

1311
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:03,600
Fuck me.

1312
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:12,600
Hey, DeVanzo, you're free to go.

1313
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:15,000
Hey, what time is it?

1314
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Five a.m..

1315
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:18,100
Shit!

1316
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:24,700
- Look, I know I messed up.
- Messed up...

1317
01:04:24,700 --> 01:04:26,400
All right, screwed up.
fucked up!

1318
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:29,400
- I really am sory.
- Stop, all right? Don't even...

1319
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:33,300
We've been friends for 30 years.
You're my best man.

1320
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:35,700
How could you miss my wedding?
What the hell is the matter with you?

1321
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:37,300
Man, I'm sory.

1322
01:04:37,300 --> 01:04:39,400
Well, I'm not. At least the fucking
Pitching Machine...

1323
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:40,500
didn't end up on my wedding.

1324
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:42,600
Look, I don't know how many times
I have to say this...

1325
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:44,100
but I really am sory!

1326
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:46,000
You know, those words,
they have no meaning coming from you...

1327
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
all right?
They're shit.

1328
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,300
I've had enough of your ''I'm sorys''
to last my lifetime.

1329
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:51,900
''I'm sory I missed your wedding.''

1330
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:53,600
I'm sory I started
that fight with Manganelli.

1331
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:56,300
I'm sory I got drunk and stole
your dad's ice cream truck.''

1332
01:04:56,300 --> 01:04:57,400
I mean I could go on...

1333
01:04:57,400 --> 01:04:59,800
Wait, the ice cream truck thing
I was 12 years old.

1334
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:01,400
Yeah, and you haven't changed
a bit!

1335
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:05,700
You selfish prick! You even manage
to make my wedding about you.

1336
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:08,900
Obviously you don't want to be around me
and don't blame you.

1337
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:10,700
I'm going to quit the team.

1338
01:05:10,700 --> 01:05:12,400
Team? What team?

1339
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:14,900
We're going to lose the championship and
then the team's over because of you...

1340
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:17,500
so don't go fucking talking to me
about the team, all right?

1341
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:19,200
- What the fuck?
- What...

1342
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:20,700
- Hey, it's Dirt!
- Dirt!

1343
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:22,700
- Johnny.
- Man, hury up! Call an ambulance.

1344
01:05:22,700 --> 01:05:24,100
Dirt? Dirt?

1345
01:05:24,100 --> 01:05:26,400
We need an ambulance
here at the Tamblin Field.

1346
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:28,000
- Shit, Dirt.
- Hang on, we're getting help.

1347
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:38,400
- I can't believe you really did it.
- He always said that's what he wanted.

1348
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:40,300
I want to go out iust like that.

1349
01:05:43,300 --> 01:05:46,600
Gentlemen, later today
we're playing for the championship...

1350
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:49,800
and for the survival of
Ed's Bar and Swill softball team.

1351
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:51,700
But right now
I want to do a toast...

1352
01:05:51,700 --> 01:05:54,700
to a fallen friend
and a teammate, Dirt...

1353
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:57,100
the greatest softball pitcher
of all time.

1354
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:58,900
To Dirt.

1355
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:00,900
- Dirt.
- Dirt.

1356
01:06:04,100 --> 01:06:06,400
Hey, Ed, what do you say?
Set up some more.

1357
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:08,200
To be honest,
if Dirt hasn't died...

1358
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:11,300
I wouldn't even be talking
to you right now...

1359
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:14,600
but I stilI don't want
our friendship to end, all right?

1360
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:16,000
Me neither, man.

1361
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,600
Look, Maz,
this ain't a good excuse...

1362
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:19,300
but I just couldn't show up
to your wedding...

1363
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:21,800
in front of fucking Manganelli
without a date.

1364
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:24,700
It would have been too humiliating
after that thing with Linda.

1365
01:06:24,700 --> 01:06:27,800
Artie, don't let that prick get to you.
That's what fucks eveything up.

1366
01:06:28,100 --> 01:06:30,100
That's when you become
the asshole.

1367
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:33,900
I want to beat him in softball too.
And ends there.

1368
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:36,400
You can't let that guy ruin
your whole freaking life.

1369
01:06:37,100 --> 01:06:39,400
I know, I know.
You're right, man. You're right.

1370
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:41,100
I mean, you got to let it go.

1371
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:44,700
And if he doesn't, you should.

1372
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:47,400
Fuck it.
I'm just going to let it go.

1373
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:49,400
I'm done worying about
Dennis Manganelli.

1374
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:50,400
All right.

1375
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:52,100
Thanks for talking to me
like this, man.

1376
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:54,000
You'd do the same thing for me,
you know?

1377
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,200
No, I would have went behind your back
telling eveyone what a dick you were.

1378
01:06:57,800 --> 01:06:59,000
Hey, lovebirds...

1379
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,900
sory to interrupt your little date
over there...

1380
01:07:00,900 --> 01:07:03,200
but we're toasting Dirt.
Your shots are accumulating.

1381
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:04,800
All right, all right, we're coming.

1382
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:07,300
Not to much drinking. We got
a championship game in two hours.

1383
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:09,600
I know.
Let's just drink one toast to Dirt.

1384
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:13,300
To the greatest rock and roll band
of all time...

1385
01:07:13,300 --> 01:07:14,800
Molly Hatchett.

1386
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:16,600
Fucking all right.

1387
01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:21,300
Watch.

1388
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:24,100
I'm going to place this pe_ectly.

1389
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:32,400
Asshole.

1390
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:34,200
Ed, another round of tequila.

1391
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:39,200
You guys finished all my tequila.
Dave drank the last bottle by himself.

1392
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:44,000
Last night I had a dream that I killed
evey single one of you guys.

1393
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:45,900
Relax, Dave. Hey!

1394
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:48,600
Easy, Dave. Come on!

1395
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:50,700
Hey, what time is it?

1396
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:52,900
Holy shit, its almost game time.
We got to go.

1397
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:54,700
Eveybody got their bats and gloves
in their trunk, right?

1398
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:55,700
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1399
01:07:55,700 --> 01:07:57,100
Yeah, just got to go home
and get my uniform.

1400
01:07:57,100 --> 01:07:58,800
- Yeah, me too.
- We ain't got time.

1401
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:01,800
If we're two seconds late, Manganelli's
going to call for a fo_eit.

1402
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:03,800
We got to go straight to the field.

1403
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:07,200
- One more drink and then we'll go.
- No, no, we got to leave right now.

1404
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:08,800
Come on.
You riding with me, Art?

1405
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:10,500
Thanks, man.
Let's go, eveybody!

1406
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:11,400
Come on, let's go!

1407
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:16,300
I can't let nine guys
drive out of here drunk.

1408
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:18,900
Well, I'm riding with Maz,
so it's really just eight.

1409
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:21,600
- Come on, I'm fine.
- We do it evey weekend.

1410
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:23,700
I can't let you guys
drive out of here all shimmed up.

1411
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:25,000
Jeez.

1412
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,800
Well, then you have to drive
all of us.

1413
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:31,300
Open the door before I shove
that stupid fucking cooler up your ass.

1414
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:33,300
Get the fuck out!
Get the fuck out!

1415
01:08:33,300 --> 01:08:35,700
What the fuck?
Let's move!

1416
01:08:36,100 --> 01:08:38,600
Man, both my legs are asleep.

1417
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:40,400
Both my balls are asleep.

1418
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:42,100
I don't want to hear
about your balls.

1419
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:43,500
Hail May, full of grace...

1420
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:46,200
Don't pray like that, all right?
God hates Guidos.

1421
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:47,400
Shit!

1422
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:52,000
It looks like the circus with all
the clowns coming out of the car.

1423
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,100
Where's Dave?

1424
01:08:53,100 --> 01:08:54,200
Did we forget Dave?

1425
01:08:55,700 --> 01:08:58,400
Anybody bring any weed?
I left mine at the funeral home.

1426
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:01,800
Play ball!

1427
01:09:03,100 --> 01:09:04,000
Oh, Christ.

1428
01:09:05,900 --> 01:09:07,400
I'm going to fucking die out here.

1429
01:09:07,900 --> 01:09:09,200
I'm fucked up, bro.

1430
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:10,500
Bourbon and tequila?

1431
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:11,500
Come on, Art.

1432
01:09:11,900 --> 01:09:13,600
All right, let's look intelligent!

1433
01:09:14,100 --> 01:09:15,200
Look alive.

1434
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:17,200
Get ready to lose!

1435
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:19,400
And here comes DeVanzo.

1436
01:09:19,700 --> 01:09:22,300
He's a sandy-haried,
slender-thighed...

1437
01:09:22,300 --> 01:09:25,100
long-legged,
big beautiful young man...

1438
01:09:25,100 --> 01:09:26,900
with excellent bone structure.

1439
01:09:27,300 --> 01:09:29,400
The pussy he must get on the road.

1440
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:30,600
Hey, look.

1441
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:33,100
Drunk rookie pitcher on the mound.

1442
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:35,000
We're going to destroy you.

1443
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:37,300
You've never even pitched before.

1444
01:09:37,300 --> 01:09:40,700
No, but ifyou would do it,
it can't be that hard, bro.

1445
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:41,700
Come on.

1446
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:45,100
DeVanzo wheels, deals,
rocks, kicks the up ring.

1447
01:09:51,300 --> 01:09:53,200
What the fuck are we doing here?

1448
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:56,000
- You have done that before, haven't you?
- Shut up!

1449
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,500
I'm still going to strike you out.

1450
01:09:57,500 --> 01:09:59,600
A_! A_!
Don't let him get to you.

1451
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,200
Come on.

1452
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:03,700
Well. Well.

1453
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:04,800
Beautiful.

1454
01:10:09,100 --> 01:10:11,100
Ball four.
Take you base.

1455
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:13,400
Yeah, I got a feeling
he will be saying that a lot today.

1456
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:15,600
Come on, Art.

1457
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:19,700
Shit, it's going to be
a long game, bro.

1458
01:10:19,700 --> 01:10:21,600
All right, don't wory, don't wory.
He'll settle in.

1459
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:23,700
Hey, Art.
Come on, Art.

1460
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,800
Come on, Artie, focus.
Come on.

1461
01:10:31,900 --> 01:10:32,900
Yeah! Double play!

1462
01:10:32,900 --> 01:10:34,700
Yeah! Come on, Johnny.
Get it! Get it!

1463
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:39,000
Shit! Shit!

1464
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,100
This is the longest day
of your life, Artie.

1465
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:55,300
Run! Run!

1466
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,300
Home! Home!

1467
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:04,500
Run, Dennis! Run!

1468
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:11,600
Jeez!

1469
01:11:12,500 --> 01:11:13,800
Oh, God.

1470
01:11:15,700 --> 01:11:16,700
I'm good.

1471
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:20,300
Come on, Dennis.
Come on, Dennis.

1472
01:11:22,900 --> 01:11:23,800
You're out!

1473
01:11:25,100 --> 01:11:26,600
And who's got a Percoset?

1474
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:29,600
All right, here we go!

1475
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:32,600
All right. That's me, right at!

1476
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,100
Fucking asshole.

1477
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:38,400
You're out!

1478
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:39,800
Ba_ly rules!

1479
01:11:40,900 --> 01:11:42,500
Come on, Bobby.
Place it.

1480
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,100
Asshole.

1481
01:11:49,700 --> 01:11:52,200
God, I'm glad Dirt
ain't around to see this.

1482
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:54,900
You're out!

1483
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:56,500
You're out.

1484
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:02,100
Thought the tank was empty.

1485
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:03,900
- They keep doing this to themselves.
- I know. Here you go.

1486
01:12:03,900 --> 01:12:05,300
- Here you go, guys, coffee.
- Help yourselves.

1487
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:08,000
Thanks a lot.
Jimmy needed this.

1488
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,100
Yeah, coffee.

1489
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:10,900
- Hi, baby.
- Hey.

1490
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,100
You smell like booze.

1491
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:14,800
- It gets you hot, though.
- Actually, it does.

1492
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:16,000
Thanks for the coffee, honey.

1493
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,800
10-O. They're killing us.
Last at bat.

1494
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:20,100
I'm sory.

1495
01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:21,600
- Hey, Gina.
- Hey, Artie.

1496
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:24,400
I'm really sory about missing
your wedding.

1497
01:12:24,700 --> 01:12:26,200
Listen, don't wory about it.

1498
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:28,800
You not showing up
was the best gift I got.

1499
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:30,900
The only disaster
was Johnny's toast.

1500
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:32,700
What?
He said it went great.

1501
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:38,200
So to recap, throughout it all there's
been a lot of laughter and a few tears.

1502
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:42,200
But in the end, the clouds parted,
the sun shined down...

1503
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:45,500
and the good Lord himself
decided it was meant to be.

1504
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:49,600
That's how I finished
the regular season batting.706.

1505
01:12:49,900 --> 01:12:50,900
Salud.

1506
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:52,800
What do we say, Dennis?

1507
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:54,300
Come on, Dennis.
We're right behind you.

1508
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:55,800
Out.

1509
01:12:56,100 --> 01:12:59,100
Damn, now bourbon,
tequila and coffee.

1510
01:12:59,100 --> 01:13:00,200
Two away!

1511
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:02,800
DeVanzo shift!

1512
01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:06,500
Well, you're down 10-O...

1513
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:09,000
and you're going to make
your team's last out ever.

1514
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,500
How's that feel, alcoholic?

1515
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:15,000
Hury up and pitch, asshole.
I'm losing my buzz.

1516
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,800
What do you say, Artie?
What do you say?

1517
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:19,800
Hey, Artie?

1518
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:20,700
What?

1519
01:13:22,300 --> 01:13:23,400
Come here.

1520
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,900
Hey, Linda.

1521
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:31,000
Hey, sweetie.
How's it going? What's up?

1522
01:13:31,300 --> 01:13:33,000
Artie, you're a fucking ierk.

1523
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,000
I know.

1524
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,800
Unfortunately, that seems to be
my go-to move.

1525
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:40,300
But I really miss you.

1526
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:42,200
I miss you too.

1527
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:45,100
You want to talk after the game?

1528
01:13:45,100 --> 01:13:47,600
Let's talk now
and make this jerk-offs wait.

1529
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:48,500
Hey, Linda?

1530
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:51,300
I'll meet you in my office
at the gym after the game.

1531
01:13:51,700 --> 01:13:53,600
Shut the fuck up, Needle Dick!

1532
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:54,900
And thanks for the herpes!

1533
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:00,300
- Ball bag.
- What an asshole.

1534
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:02,400
- Asshole.
- Jerk-off.

1535
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:05,000
This town is 980/o skanks.

1536
01:14:07,300 --> 01:14:08,600
That's my girl.

1537
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:11,200
Let's go. Batter up!

1538
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:13,100
- I'll see you after the game, all right?
- Okay.

1539
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:16,600
Bye.

1540
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:19,500
- Come on.
- Come on!

1541
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:22,300
Get the fuck in, you lazy fuck.

1542
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:23,800
Classy broad you got there, bro.

1543
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:26,000
Thanks, Needle Dick.

1544
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:29,500
Put it up there, Dennis.
He can't hit it.

1545
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:32,100
- Come on.
- Here we go. Here we go.

1546
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:33,800
No.

1547
01:14:36,500 --> 01:14:38,300
- Yeah. Get out.
- Come on!

1548
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:41,200
- Yeah!
- What?

1549
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:42,200
Fuck!

1550
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:45,700
Yeah!

1551
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:48,900
Hell of a shot, bro!

1552
01:14:49,300 --> 01:14:53,300
Son of a bitch, motherfucker,
bastard, asshole!

1553
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:55,100
Nice shot, Artie.

1554
01:14:55,100 --> 01:14:57,400
Hey, you assholes
knock that off...

1555
01:14:57,400 --> 01:14:59,500
or I'm revoking
your gym memberships!

1556
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:02,300
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1557
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:06,500
Yeah!

1558
01:15:07,700 --> 01:15:09,200
Yeah!

1559
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:13,600
- Nice shot!
- That's right!

1560
01:15:13,900 --> 01:15:15,900
At least you got some revenge
on that prick Manganelli...

1561
01:15:15,900 --> 01:15:17,500
even if we're not going to win.

1562
01:15:17,500 --> 01:15:19,900
What the fuck are you talking about?
We're going to win.

1563
01:15:19,900 --> 01:15:22,200
Art, it's 10-1.
We're down to our last out.

1564
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:23,200
I don't give a fuck.

1565
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:25,800
Anyone who thinks we're going to lose
can go home right now!

1566
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:27,200
Hey, calm down, will you?

1567
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:29,000
Would Dirt calm down
if he were here?

1568
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,700
No. After my homer he would have
thrown a bat at my head...

1569
01:15:31,700 --> 01:15:33,700
for not running
around the bases harder.

1570
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:37,700
Now this is the last inning. Let's get
some runs and take that fucking troll!

1571
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:39,100
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1572
01:15:44,900 --> 01:15:45,800
Come on now!

1573
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:50,400
Nice! Nice going, Maz!

1574
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,200
Run, you motherfucker!
Nice! Nice!

1575
01:15:57,800 --> 01:15:58,800
All right.

1576
01:16:00,100 --> 01:16:01,800
Come on, Dave.
What do you say?

1577
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:05,000
Come on, Dave.
Let's go.

1578
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,900
- Come on, bring it!
- Yeah, that's right.

1579
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:09,100
Yeah! Yeah!

1580
01:16:09,100 --> 01:16:11,700
Holy shit, Dave got a hit.
Holy living Christ.

1581
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:18,700
Lucky shot.

1582
01:16:19,100 --> 01:16:20,000
Come on, Albert.

1583
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:21,600
Yeah!

1584
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:23,500
Come on!

1585
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:25,200
- Shit!
- Cocksucker!

1586
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:27,100
Damn!

1587
01:16:27,100 --> 01:16:28,700
Now we're looking like a team!

1588
01:16:29,900 --> 01:16:30,800
Yeah!

1589
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:34,000
Stay on the bag, Dave.

1590
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:37,700
Come on, guys. Keep it going.
Let's go! Come on!

1591
01:16:37,700 --> 01:16:38,800
Come on, Daryl.

1592
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:40,600
Nice swing.

1593
01:16:41,700 --> 01:16:44,100
Run!
Run, Dave, come on!

1594
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:46,200
It's a gapper!
It's a gapper, come on!

1595
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,100
Shit!

1596
01:16:53,700 --> 01:16:54,900
Asshole!

1597
01:16:54,900 --> 01:16:57,200
Yes! Get me a beer, somebody,
come on!

1598
01:16:57,800 --> 01:16:59,200
You're up, you're up, you're up.

1599
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:01,200
Yeah! Yeah!

1600
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:04,500
What do you say, Dave?

1601
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:07,500
Nice! Like a gazelle, buddy!
Like a gazelle running out there.

1602
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:09,500
What do you say, Alfonse?
Come on, one time!

1603
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:10,700
We need you, buddy!

1604
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:15,100
Nice, Alphonse!
Run!

1605
01:17:15,100 --> 01:17:17,600
Run, you sweaty Guido!
Run! Come on!

1606
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:19,500
Yeah!

1607
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:26,600
Tim, get out there.
Come on, we need you, buddy.

1608
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:28,600
Run, run!
Do this, you sweaty...

1609
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:30,200
9Uy.

1610
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:33,700
Sweet! Sweet! Run!

1611
01:17:33,700 --> 01:17:36,400
Run, you crazy motherfucker!
Run, come on!

1612
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:39,000
There you go, man!

1613
01:17:39,700 --> 01:17:41,200
One time, Johnny.

1614
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:43,400
Hey, Manganelli,
you're looking good, shitnuts.

1615
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:45,800
We're rocking you,
you pansy ass.

1616
01:17:46,900 --> 01:17:48,200
It's so unfair.

1617
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:50,100
It's like pitching
to a healthy Lou Gehrig.

1618
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:54,700
Yeah!

1619
01:17:54,700 --> 01:17:55,600
Fuck!

1620
01:17:57,600 --> 01:17:59,800
Let's go! Get it in here!

1621
01:18:07,700 --> 01:18:09,100
DeVanzo shift.

1622
01:18:10,700 --> 01:18:12,900
We're one out away
from the championship.

1623
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:14,800
Force at any base.

1624
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:17,500
One more bum and they're done.

1625
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:19,800
You pricks stay awake out there,
God damn it.

1626
01:18:20,100 --> 01:18:22,800
Don't wory about the shift, Art.
We're down 10-6.

1627
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:24,900
Just put it over the wall,
we tie it up. Let's go!

1628
01:18:24,900 --> 01:18:27,000
Come on, Artie!
Give it a ride, brother. Come on!

1629
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,100
Come on, big stick up there, Artie.
Let's go!

1630
01:18:29,100 --> 01:18:30,300
You can beat this guy.

1631
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:31,500
He fucking blows.

1632
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:34,100
Your attention, please.

1633
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:35,900
Ladies and gentlemen...

1634
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:39,100
now pitching for Manganelli...

1635
01:18:39,100 --> 01:18:41,600
number one, Needle Dick.

1636
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,100
- Number one.
- Yeah, all right.

1637
01:18:45,100 --> 01:18:46,400
Needle Dick.

1638
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:49,300
Shut the fuck up!
Your luck's run out, DeVanzo.

1639
01:18:49,300 --> 01:18:51,900
This is your last at bat
in this league forever!

1640
01:18:51,900 --> 01:18:54,100
I'm going to have to remodel
the window of my gym...

1641
01:18:54,100 --> 01:18:56,700
to fit that fifth trophy,
but fuck it, right?

1642
01:18:56,700 --> 01:18:57,700
Let's go!

1643
01:18:57,700 --> 01:19:00,500
For the last time,
you're not getting that trophy.

1644
01:19:01,300 --> 01:19:03,200
Come on, hit it out, baby!

1645
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:04,900
Come on, hit it out, fuckhead!

1646
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:09,500
Prepare to continue you lifetime
losing streak, jerk-off.

1647
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,200
Bring it on.

1648
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:13,200
Stay cool, Artie.
Stay cool.

1649
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:16,000
Let's go.
Let's go.

1650
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Come on, Dennis.

1651
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:18,700
Let's go.

1652
01:19:20,100 --> 01:19:21,100
Yeah!

1653
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:22,500
Yeah!

1654
01:19:23,900 --> 01:19:26,100
Come on, show what you can do.
Get the ball!

1655
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:27,600
Hury. Come on!

1656
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:29,000
Come on, run!

1657
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,800
Hury! Let's go! Run!

1658
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:33,500
Get the fucking ball!

1659
01:19:35,900 --> 01:19:36,900
Yeah!

1660
01:19:36,900 --> 01:19:38,500
Artie, run! Run!

1661
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:42,200
Come on, throw it!

1662
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:45,100
Home! Home!

1663
01:19:46,100 --> 01:19:47,100
Come on, Artie.

1664
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:49,600
Shit!

1665
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:50,600
Get it!

1666
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:53,400
Score, Artie, score!
You're going to score!

1667
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:57,400
- Dive!
- Dive!

1668
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:06,900
You're out!

1669
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:09,400
God!

1670
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:11,300
Shit!

1671
01:20:13,700 --> 01:20:15,900
Yeah, you're the one, baby!

1672
01:20:16,300 --> 01:20:17,200
Hey, you all right?

1673
01:20:18,700 --> 01:20:20,000
Yeah, I'm all right.

1674
01:20:20,500 --> 01:20:21,600
It was a hell of a game.

1675
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:23,500
Good hustle.
Great shit.

1676
01:20:23,500 --> 01:20:26,000
Hey, guys,
this can't be our last game.

1677
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,600
Let's go play in Parsippany
new year.

1678
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:28,600
- I'm in.
- Yeah!

1679
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:30,700
- Me too, man.
- Let's do it.

1680
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:34,800
You know what?
Fuck it. You're right.

1681
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:37,400
We got to play again new year.
I'm in! I'm in!

1682
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:38,500
Let's go get drunk.

1683
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:41,400
That sounds great, but there's
one thing I gotta do first.

1684
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:43,600
Hey, Linda, pull the car around.

1685
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:44,700
Okay, Artie.

1686
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:49,900
My dear Lord.

1687
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
- We did it!
- We won!

1688
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,200
- We're the best!
- Hurray!

1689
01:20:56,200 --> 01:20:58,200
Get a photographer over here!

1690
01:20:58,200 --> 01:20:59,700
Take a picture of the champs.

1691
01:20:59,700 --> 01:21:01,100
Yeah, let's get a photogra...

1692
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:04,600
Get that fat fuck!

1693
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:06,000
Artie, what the fuck are you doing?

1694
01:21:06,700 --> 01:21:08,600
DeVanzo, you're dead this time!

1695
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:09,700
Let's go, Linda.

1696
01:21:10,900 --> 01:21:12,500
I want that piece of shit killed.

1697
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:15,300
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Go. See you at the gym, fellows!

1698
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,700
Come back here,
you fucking loser.

1699
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:20,800
That was the greatest
asshole move ever.

1700
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:22,100
Absolutely.

1701
01:21:22,700 --> 01:21:25,100
God help DeVanzo
when I get my hands on him.

1702
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:27,700
Hey! Hey, kid!

1703
01:21:29,300 --> 01:21:31,200
What the helI do you think
you're doing?

1704
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:33,500
Just updating your photo,
Mayor Herpes.

1705
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:38,900
- Shit!
- Come back here, you little brat!

1706
01:21:38,900 --> 01:21:41,900
Help! This maniac
is tying to give me fucking herpes.

1707
01:21:41,900 --> 01:21:43,400
Come back here, you wise-ass.

1708
01:21:45,900 --> 01:21:49,100
I told that prick
he wasn't get that trophy.

1709
01:21:49,100 --> 01:21:50,800
You're such a pisser, Artie.

1710
01:21:51,100 --> 01:21:53,100
What are you going to do
with that crazy thing?

1711
01:21:53,100 --> 01:21:55,300
You know what?
Drive over Manganelli's gym.

1712
01:21:55,300 --> 01:21:57,600
I'll put a note on the trophy
saying I'm sory...

1713
01:21:57,600 --> 01:21:59,800
and then I'll throw it
through his front fucking window.

1714
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:02,400
God, Artie,
please, don't do that.

1715
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,200
I was just kidding.

1716
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:05,800
Hey, let's pawn it in Newa_...

1717
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:07,500
then go down the shore
and get cheese sticks.

1718
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:09,800
- Count me in.
- All right.

1719
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,200
Excuse me. Hi.
I'm sory.

1720
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:35,400
Do you know what time it is?

1721
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,400
Do you know what time it is?

1722
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:40,200
- I guess I do.
- Yes.

1723
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:42,500
Wow!

1724
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:45,500
Those are really pretty
colo_ul shoes you got there.

1725
01:22:46,100 --> 01:22:48,200
And they show off
your colorful nails.

1726
01:22:48,700 --> 01:22:49,600
Thanks.

1727
01:22:50,700 --> 01:22:51,900
Hey, do you like music?

1728
01:22:53,300 --> 01:22:54,700
Who doesn't like music?

1729
01:22:55,400 --> 01:22:57,300
That's true.
Do you like rock music?

1730
01:22:57,900 --> 01:22:59,100
I could take it or leave it.

1731
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:02,000
Because my friend band,
I know the guitar from this band...

1732
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,500
and they're playing later.

1733
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:05,300
I think I can get you
on the guest list.

1734
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:07,400
And we could split
the other ticket or...

1735
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:10,500
Hey, beat it, dirtbag.
Get lost.

1736
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:13,800
Did you want to go?

1737
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:16,100
What the fuck?
Get lost.

1738
01:23:17,100 --> 01:23:18,800
- Jesus.
- Jesus Christ.

1739
01:23:19,100 --> 01:23:21,700
I'm gone for like two minutes
and they're like vultures.

1740
01:23:21,700 --> 01:23:23,600
Two minutes?
You're gone for 20 minutes.

1741
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:26,000
The line on the cheese steak
was like an hour long.

1742
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:27,500
I'm sory.
You want a bite?

1743
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:29,900
- Have a bite. Come on.
- All right.

1744
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:34,500
What do you say, batter?

1745
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:38,100
Batter to DeVanzo at first.
He's got it. Up with it.

1746
01:23:39,700 --> 01:23:42,000
Here. Down here.
Here. Here.

1747
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,800
Two. Deuce. One time.

1748
01:23:46,700 --> 01:23:48,200
That's nothing but fun there.

1749
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:49,700
He's got it.

1750
01:23:54,300 --> 01:23:55,400
One time now.

1751
01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:58,800
Established. Here.
Clear. Here.

1752
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:00,100
Clear it. Two.

1753
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:09,000
Fire it in there.
Fire it in!

1754
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:10,500
One time.

1755
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:12,800
Look alive there. Two.

1756
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:16,200
Establishment. Here.
Here.

1757
01:24:17,100 --> 01:24:18,100
Hey, now!

1758
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:27,500
Bitch.

1759
01:24:28,100 --> 01:24:32,000
- Complete jerk-off.
- ''I want to be honest with it.

1760
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
I want to be honest
with my wife.''

1761
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,500
- Shut the fuck up.
- Asshole.

1762
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:37,100
This Danish is stale.

1763
01:24:38,900 --> 01:24:42,500
The happiest day of my life is
gonna be when you finally have a kid.

1764
01:24:42,900 --> 01:24:44,700
God bless, that means
I got laid at least once.

1765
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:58,500
Laying down a bunt is like
holding your dick and putting it in.

1766
01:24:58,500 --> 01:25:00,000
Okay? Softly.

1767
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:05,700
Hey, mom,
do we have Fluffernutter?

1768
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:10,200
- Mom!
- I'm looking!

1769
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:14,800
Fluffernutter! See if we have any
Fluffernutter! She's losing her hearing.

1770
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:16,300
I'm wory about her healthy.

1771
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:20,100
You know, the happiest days...

1772
01:25:20,100 --> 01:25:21,400
''Happy Days''?
You were on ''Happy Days''?

1773
01:25:21,400 --> 01:25:22,900
- Yes, I was. I'm Chachi.
- Okay.

1774
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:24,100
Line.

1775
01:25:24,100 --> 01:25:25,900
- A priest and a rabbi...
- No, no, no.

1776
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:29,200
- A...
- No, no, no.

1777
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:32,200
What are you doing?

1778
01:25:32,500 --> 01:25:34,800
- What's this line?
- Yep, yep, yep, yep.

1779
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:35,800
Is that the line?

1780
01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:37,400
I have no idea.

1781
01:25:37,400 --> 01:25:39,400
That's the Jersey City salute?

1782
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:43,100
That's the Jersey City salute
to Manganelli, sweetheart!

1783
01:25:43,100 --> 01:25:44,100
Your shitnuts!
