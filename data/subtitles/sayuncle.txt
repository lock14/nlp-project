1
00:01:12,972 --> 00:01:15,406
It's an invitation to listen,
even more so...

2
00:01:15,475 --> 00:01:16,965
<i>than if I wasn't...</i>

3
00:01:36,796 --> 00:01:37,524
Hey.

4
00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:41,967
Somebody's gonna
get a whuppin'.

5
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:43,002
Shut up.

6
00:01:43,803 --> 00:01:45,464
- Has Berman been over here?
- No.

7
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:47,165
You're still gonna
get a whuppin'.

8
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,707
Not if he didn't see me.

9
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,572
<i>He saw you, Paul.</i>
I saw him see you.

10
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:51,905
Just because you don't
want a thing to be true,

11
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:52,945
<i>doesn't mean it's not.</i>

12
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:55,742
Could you stop
bothering me Paul?

13
00:01:55,815 --> 00:01:57,715
I've got calls to make,
magazines to sell.

14
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:03,687
- So how was lunch?
- Uh, good, good.

15
00:02:03,756 --> 00:02:04,950
<i>Yeah, I bet.</i>

16
00:02:05,024 --> 00:02:06,616
I'd like a two-hour
lunch myself.

17
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:09,355
Yeah, sorry.
I lost track of time.

18
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:10,555
<i>Really?</i>
<i>What a surprise.</i>

19
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,723
You can make it up at
the end of the day.

20
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:13,959
OK.

21
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:15,898
<i>Don't do the crime if</i>
<i>you haven't got the time.</i>

22
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,960
Now don't you have
quotas to meet?

23
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:24,434
Dink.

24
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:36,622
Johnson, I forgot something.

25
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:39,689
I've got changes
to the script.

26
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:40,919
After the first refusal...

27
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:43,588
Jesus Christ, Johnson.
You gotta be kidding me.

28
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:46,598
What world do you live
in that this is OK?

29
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,930
You take a freaking
two-hour lunch...

30
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,867
and now you're
painting at your desk?

31
00:02:51,804 --> 00:02:53,431
<i>God Almighty.</i>

32
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:56,566
<i>You creative types drive me</i>
<i>crazy, you think just because...</i>

33
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:58,474
<i>you're an artist or something</i>
<i>that you don't have to...</i>

34
00:02:58,545 --> 00:03:00,570
act like normal people-
Let me tell you something.

35
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:02,581
There's something
called responsibility...

36
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:04,014
and it's a two-handed shovel...

37
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:06,074
and I can't chop down
the tree by myself.

38
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:06,982
You understand.

39
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:11,423
Hey, hey, are you
even listening to me?

40
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:13,757
Uh, sorry.

41
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:15,855
I don't want to hear it.

42
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:17,556
You don't think, Johnson.

43
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:20,126
Look, just go home.

44
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,531
- I don't need to...
- Just go home.

45
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:23,228
- I...
- There is no "I"...

46
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:25,066
in "Walker Telemarketing,"
Johnson.

47
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:27,106
- Actually...
- Shut up.

48
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:30,006
Just go home, and come back
tomorrow when you're ready to work.

49
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:31,773
Got it.

50
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:32,902
Ready to work.

51
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:41,151
It's finished.

52
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:16,413
Oh!

53
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:35,066
- You're early.
- Yeah.

54
00:05:35,134 --> 00:05:36,795
- What happened?
- What's for dinner?

55
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:37,995
Hey, no.

56
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:39,897
What's that?

57
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:41,132
It's Morgan.

58
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:44,005
Paul, that's beautiful.
- Yeah.

59
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:45,640
Where is he?

60
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:47,179
He's in his room playing.

61
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:48,508
By himself?

62
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:50,105
What kind of mother are you?

63
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,582
What happened at work today?

64
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,318
Hey, little monkey.

65
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:08,795
Whatcha doin'?

66
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:13,806
Are you my little monkey?

67
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,534
Look what I made you.

68
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:20,244
Yeah, it's a painting.

69
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:21,940
- Painting.
- Yeah.

70
00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:23,208
For Morgan.

71
00:06:23,282 --> 00:06:24,112
Morgan.

72
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:25,081
Morgan, the monkey.

73
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:43,126
Jump, jump, jump.
Jump, jump, jump.

74
00:06:43,202 --> 00:06:45,193
Jump, jump, jump.

75
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:51,239
Quit jumping on
the bed, you two!

76
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:57,412
You're early.
What is going on?

77
00:06:58,618 --> 00:06:59,448
Where's my boy?

78
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:01,282
He's in the bedroom,
playing with his Godfather.

79
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:19,931
Hey, Morgan.

80
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,030
Hey, Uncle Paul.

81
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:24,698
Hey, Jim.

82
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:25,937
Can you say "Hi, Daddy."

83
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:29,842
Wow, the whole family's home early.

84
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:30,940
What do you say we
get out of here?

85
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:33,777
OK.

86
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,914
You haven't told
him yet, have you?

87
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,693
I just don't know
what he's going to do.

88
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:11,220
- I'm not telling him.
- I'll tell him.

89
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,689
Just be gentle, okay?

90
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:15,955
He's not a plum, Sarah.
I'm not gonna bruise him.

91
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:17,290
OK.

92
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,529
I'll tell him.

93
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,430
You tell him.

94
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:22,468
Tell me what?

95
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:27,268
Well, um... we've got
some good news.

96
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,433
Yeah?

97
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,374
I, um, I got a new job.

98
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:33,969
Oh yeah?
Congratulations.

99
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:35,980
Thanks.
I'm really excited.

100
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:42,786
But the not so good
news is it's... in Japan.

101
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:48,416
And we're leaving next week.

102
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:53,928
I wanted to tell you sooner,
but it was just so crazy...

103
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,558
and I didn't want
you to freak out.

104
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:09,706
It's...

105
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:17,952
And the littlest
monkey left his tribe...

106
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:20,652
and set out to find
his place in the world.

107
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:25,322
First he came to a tree filled
with beautiful cockatiels.

108
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:29,357
"Henry, Henry," he called,
"Is any of you my friend Henry?"

109
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:30,527
With shoes on.

110
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:32,298
Yeah, the monkey
had shoes on.

111
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:35,431
"Quiet," says the cockatiels,
"We're sleeping."

112
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:37,237
<i>"Is any of you my friend Henry?"</i>

113
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,868
<i>the littlest</i>
<i>monkey asked again.</i>

114
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:41,573
<i>"No, there's no Henry here,"</i>
<i>said the cockatiels,</i>

115
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:42,978
<i>not very nicely.</i>

116
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:44,414
<i>"Now leave us alone."</i>

117
00:09:44,483 --> 00:09:48,112
<i>And suddenly the cockatiels</i>
<i>weren't very beautiful any more.</i>

118
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:51,088
<i>The littlest monkey</i>
<i>kept walking.</i>

119
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:54,183
Are you tired little buddy?
You need to go night-night?

120
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,194
Come here, come here you.

121
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,059
Are you ready for bed?

122
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,859
Are you ready
for bed, mister?

123
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:03,528
Okay, come on.

124
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,438
OK, well uh...
Morgan's asleep so...

125
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:10,770
I'm going to head home.

126
00:10:10,843 --> 00:10:12,538
Okay.
You OK?

127
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,445
Yeah.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

128
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:16,344
Night sweetie.

129
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:04,892
OK.

130
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:07,824
- Thank you.
- Uh-huh.

131
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,460
OK...
I'm gonna head home.

132
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:12,026
Wait, no, don't go.

133
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:13,264
Well uh, I'm tired.

134
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,204
Just wait one second.
I have something for you.

135
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,338
Sit.

136
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:22,313
- What's this?
- Just open it.

137
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:23,643
- What is it?
- Open it.

138
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:32,020
That is hilarious.

139
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:34,059
I thought you'd like it.

140
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:36,117
He looks like one of
the Village People.

141
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:38,992
There's a picture of me,
just like this...

142
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:41,033
except I'm a construction worker.

143
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,158
Nice.

144
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:45,328
I can't wait to
show this to my mom,

145
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:46,735
she loves the Village People.

146
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:48,330
She does?
That's weird.

147
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:50,932
Yeah, well, she's
a weird lady.

148
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:54,174
Anyway, thanks for this.

149
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,413
For his Uncle Paul.

150
00:11:57,483 --> 00:11:59,849
- I'm not really his uncle.
- You might as well be.

151
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:04,019
Yeah, I guess.

152
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:09,153
Listen, I want to apologize
for not telling you sooner.

153
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,423
I just didn't know
how you were gonna...

154
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:17,434
Look, I know it's going
really fast but we're leaving...

155
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:19,698
Saturday morning at 10 am.
OK?

156
00:12:22,174 --> 00:12:23,232
OK.

157
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:28,303
- Well, bye.
- Bye.

158
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,076
Bye, Jim.

159
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:34,211
Bye, Morgan.

160
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:48,166
Come here, come here.

161
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:56,806
I got a hankering
for biscuits, gravy...

162
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:59,868
and a big old bowl of
collard greens so... Taco Bell?

163
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,207
OK.

164
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:08,446
<i>Hello?</i>

165
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:09,883
<i>Hello?</i>

166
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,047
<i>I'm just kidding.</i>

167
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:12,147
<i>I'm not here.</i>

168
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:14,956
<i>Paul?</i>

169
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:16,221
<i>Honey?</i>

170
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,422
<i>I'm sure I don't</i>
<i>need to do this,</i>

171
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:21,330
<i>but I wanted to remind you</i>
<i>that today's the day we're...</i>

172
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:25,567
<i>God, it's even</i>
<i>hard to say.</i>

173
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,970
<i>Well, I'll see you</i>
<i>when you get here.</i>

174
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:33,578
That's everything.

175
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:39,381
Where the hell is he?

176
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:58,659
Hey... it's time to leave.

177
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:13,801
Uh, can I help you?

178
00:16:13,872 --> 00:16:15,635
Oh. Hi.

179
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:19,200
I'm Paul... Morgan's godfather.

180
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:20,074
OK.

181
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:24,875
<i>Are you babysitting?</i>
<i>Oh, is he asleep?</i>

182
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,247
Sorry.

183
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:27,979
What's your name?

184
00:16:28,053 --> 00:16:30,715
Elise.
Who are you?

185
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:35,089
Wow, Elise... got a boy over
while you're babysitting.

186
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:37,560
We're not babysitting.

187
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:44,925
Am I not supposed
to say that anymore?

188
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:48,235
What, they don't like
being called babies?

189
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:50,600
Whatever.

190
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:54,211
Look, I don't want
to wake him up,

191
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:58,181
so just tell Morgan that his
Uncle Paul stopped by...

192
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,547
and that I love him.

193
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:03,551
OK. Bye.

194
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:05,285
Bye.

195
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:19,701
Hey!

196
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:22,172
Hey, what are you doing?

197
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:23,572
Uh, nothing.

198
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:25,542
Look, you're gonna
have to leave. OK?

199
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:26,578
Ok, um...

200
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:29,239
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

201
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:34,918
Um, look, I made
this for Morgan...

202
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:37,012
It's OK, you don't have
to give me anything.

203
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:39,023
No, I didn't want to
scare you. Please...

204
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:40,319
I want you to have it.

205
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:55,769
It's beautiful.

206
00:17:56,942 --> 00:17:57,772
Thanks.

207
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:07,519
I'm sorry... um,
what's your name?

208
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:08,814
Paul.

209
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:10,081
Elise.

210
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:11,850
It's nice to meet you.

211
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:14,557
You, too.

212
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,428
Look, Paul, um...

213
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:33,108
I don't know what the Fabers
told you or... or didn't tell you.

214
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:34,406
Um...

215
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:38,513
They moved.

216
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:39,949
To Japan.

217
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:54,862
<i>I'm so sorry if</i>
<i>you didn't know.</i>

218
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,247
Sorry.
You were smushing my boob.

219
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,296
<i>Paul?</i>

220
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:33,599
<i>Honey?</i>

221
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,902
<i>I'm sure I don't</i>
<i>need to do this,</i>

222
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:39,410
<i>but I wanted to remind you</i>
<i>that today's the day that we're...</i>

223
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:43,273
<i>God, it's even</i>
<i>hard to say...</i>

224
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:45,680
<i>well, I'll just see you when</i>
<i>you get here.</i>

225
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:53,550
<i>Hey, honey, I'm sorry we</i>
<i>didn't get to say goodbye.</i>

226
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:56,253
<i>I guess you got</i>
<i>the time confused,</i>

227
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:58,626
<i>or maybe I didn't tell you</i>
<i>the right time, I don't know.</i>

228
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:04,332
<i>We're at the airport</i>
<i>now... off to Japan.</i>

229
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:09,568
<i>Can you believe it?</i>
<i>I already miss you so much.</i>

230
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:13,099
<i>I'll call you soon to</i>
<i>see how you're doing.</i>

231
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:15,305
<i>Morgan, want to say</i>
<i>bye to Uncle Paul?</i>

232
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,041
<i>- Bye-bye.</i>
<i>- OK.</i>

233
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:18,707
<i>Bye, sweetie.</i>

234
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:20,046
<i>We all love you.</i>

235
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,052
- OK.
- Where's Johnson?

236
00:20:28,126 --> 00:20:29,821
I am not my
brother's keeper.

237
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:47,304
And you can tell your friend,
if he's not part of the solution,

238
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:48,368
he's part of the problem,

239
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:49,880
and you've got to cut loose
all the dead branches, right?

240
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:51,040
OK.

241
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:52,708
- What does that mean, exactly?
- It means he's fired.

242
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:54,809
Tell him to come in
and get his stuff.

243
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:56,478
Actually, tell
him not to bother,

244
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:58,386
I'm going to keep all
those paints for my kids.

245
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:33,949
Trash.

246
00:21:35,193 --> 00:21:36,421
Trash.

247
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:38,725
For the kids.

248
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,196
Jesus Christ.

249
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:08,888
Walker Telemarketing.
May I help you?

250
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,619
<i>Russell?</i>

251
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:11,959
<i>Hey, it's Sarah...</i>
<i>Faber.</i>

252
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,793
Oh, hey, hey.
How are ya?

253
00:22:13,865 --> 00:22:14,729
<i>Good, good.</i>

254
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,291
<i>Listen, I'm a little</i>
<i>concerned about Paul.</i>

255
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:20,133
You and me both.
I haven't seen him for days.

256
00:22:20,205 --> 00:22:21,467
<i>You're kidding.</i>

257
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:24,008
No. I thought he was
with you guys.

258
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:25,703
<i>No. No.</i>

259
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:27,802
<i>Did he not tell you</i>
<i>we moved to Japan?</i>

260
00:22:27,879 --> 00:22:29,141
What?

261
00:22:29,214 --> 00:22:31,114
We moved.
Last week.

262
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,013
<i>You're kidding, right?</i>

263
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:33,745
No, I'm not.

264
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:35,184
<i>He didn't say anything?</i>

265
00:22:35,253 --> 00:22:36,982
Oh my God.

266
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:37,817
<i>Yeah.</i>

267
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:42,389
So Japan, huh?

268
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:45,555
You do know all the people
there are Japanese, right?

269
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:47,860
Yeah, I feel so tall suddenly.

270
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:51,596
Listen, if you hear anything
at all will you let me know?

271
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:57,939
My phone number is
011-81-655426.

272
00:22:58,009 --> 00:23:00,739
So then just, sayonara.

273
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:01,676
OK, bye.

274
00:23:04,783 --> 00:23:05,613
Sayonara.

275
00:23:42,053 --> 00:23:43,577
First of all, you need to
lock your door...

276
00:23:43,655 --> 00:23:45,555
because this is a
terrible neighborhood.

277
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:46,556
I'm sorry, Paul.

278
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:48,422
This sucks.
Yes, it totally sucks.

279
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:50,654
But you will get
through this.

280
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:53,254
I know that Morgan was a
huge part of your life,

281
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:55,026
but he wasn't your life.

282
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,125
<i>And you will see him again.</i>

283
00:23:57,702 --> 00:23:58,964
<i>Sometimes.</i>

284
00:23:59,037 --> 00:24:02,302
<i>And you've got your</i>
<i>painting, you've got me,</i>

285
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:04,342
<i>you've got your parents.</i>

286
00:24:04,409 --> 00:24:06,309
Well, I've got you.

287
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:09,905
My parents aren't that
much help, really.

288
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:12,074
That's right, you've got me.

289
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:13,344
And it's just gonna
take some time.

290
00:24:13,418 --> 00:24:15,886
But you can't lay
around here waiting on it.

291
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:18,013
You gotta get back
in the world. OK?

292
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:21,819
C'mon, let's go do something.

293
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:24,792
What do you want to do?

294
00:24:34,573 --> 00:24:35,699
Well, go on.

295
00:24:36,441 --> 00:24:37,567
Nah.

296
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:38,939
Go on.

297
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:41,001
- I don't wanna.
- Yes, you do.

298
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:42,273
I'm too embarrassed.

299
00:24:43,348 --> 00:24:44,906
You're too embarrassed?

300
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:47,451
- I'm very shy.
- You are not.

301
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:49,714
Now go on.
Get out there and play.

302
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:51,221
The kids are gonna
think I'm weird.

303
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:53,519
You are weird Paul.
Now go on.

304
00:25:08,206 --> 00:25:09,230
Want a push?

305
00:25:09,307 --> 00:25:10,365
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

306
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:14,011
- You wanna go high?
- Yeah.

307
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:15,413
Yeah?

308
00:25:28,326 --> 00:25:29,384
Whatcha doin'?

309
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:30,792
Nufin'.

310
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:31,658
Nothin'?

311
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:33,823
Not even one tiny
little thing?

312
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:34,888
Not even breathing?

313
00:25:34,966 --> 00:25:35,830
Nope.

314
00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:37,198
Oh my goodness.

315
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:40,363
Somebody better get
this guy an ambulance.

316
00:25:40,438 --> 00:25:43,168
He's not breathing.

317
00:25:43,241 --> 00:25:45,232
Hey somebody...

318
00:25:46,244 --> 00:25:48,041
Be-naah.

319
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,845
Be-naah.

320
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:57,887
You're not breathing either?

321
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:10,800
Tyler, honey,
go on.

322
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:11,631
If you want a
ride just ask him.

323
00:26:11,703 --> 00:26:13,034
All right?

324
00:26:13,104 --> 00:26:13,729
Say please.

325
00:26:16,274 --> 00:26:18,572
Do you a...
do you want a ride?

326
00:26:18,643 --> 00:26:19,803
Come on.

327
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,308
OK.
Thank you.

328
00:26:22,681 --> 00:26:25,582
<i>Hold on, 'cause</i>
<i>we're going fast!</i>

329
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:28,679
<i>It's so nice to see a man</i>
<i>here, for a change.</i>

330
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:31,382
I just love when dads get
involved with their kids.

331
00:26:31,456 --> 00:26:32,582
<i>No kidding.</i>

332
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:35,217
Did you hear about
the Archer's au pair?

333
00:26:35,293 --> 00:26:37,921
- No.
- The agency sent a guy.

334
00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:39,190
From France. OK?

335
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,528
Apparently his
name was Camille...

336
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,261
so they didn't know
until he showed up.

337
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:44,700
Oh my God!
What did they do?

338
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:46,999
Well, they sent him back.
Thank God.

339
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:50,166
<i>Who's wants to leave their children</i>
<i>with some strange Frenchman?</i>

340
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:52,576
You want a fish?

341
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,309
Hey.

342
00:27:01,386 --> 00:27:05,152
Look, I'm really sorry
about last week, but I,

343
00:27:05,223 --> 00:27:07,214
uh, I need my job back.

344
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:09,260
I promise it won't
happen again.

345
00:27:09,327 --> 00:27:10,191
No, it won't.

346
00:27:10,261 --> 00:27:13,094
The not showing up thing
definitely won't happen again.

347
00:27:13,164 --> 00:27:14,028
No, it won't.

348
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:15,361
Because you don't
work here anymore.

349
00:27:15,433 --> 00:27:16,991
Oh, come on, Berman.

350
00:27:17,068 --> 00:27:19,298
- David.
- David, sorry.

351
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:21,430
- Give me another chance.
- Look, Paul...

352
00:27:21,506 --> 00:27:24,373
If you don't tow the line,
the other bird gets the worm.

353
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:29,410
Ok, um, well, what if
I make it up to you.

354
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,608
It's too late, Johnson.
You blew it.

355
00:27:34,085 --> 00:27:36,576
Besides, I don't need
any freaks on the team.

356
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,627
How'd it go?

357
00:27:46,698 --> 00:27:48,495
No luck.

358
00:27:48,566 --> 00:27:50,193
Yeah, I figured that.

359
00:27:50,268 --> 00:27:51,394
Yeah.

360
00:27:51,469 --> 00:27:53,437
The job sucks anyway.

361
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:55,996
Easy to say when
you have one.

362
00:27:56,074 --> 00:27:56,802
True.

363
00:27:56,875 --> 00:27:59,742
Although I'm still hoping that
Oprah picks me for her book club.

364
00:27:59,811 --> 00:28:00,675
Hey.

365
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,614
It probably means I need
to finish the book first.

366
00:28:04,282 --> 00:28:05,306
Probably so.

367
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:08,248
Ah, it's OK.

368
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:10,651
I'll probably find a job
that lets me paint more anyway.

369
00:28:10,722 --> 00:28:12,155
Definitely.
Maybe you could find something...

370
00:28:12,223 --> 00:28:13,281
you really want to do.

371
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:14,921
Like what?

372
00:28:15,293 --> 00:28:17,853
I don't know. What
do you really like to do?

373
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:19,157
Besides painting, I mean.

374
00:28:20,131 --> 00:28:21,393
I don't know.

375
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,030
Get him!

376
00:28:23,501 --> 00:28:24,433
<i>Get him!</i>

377
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:26,294
I mean, there's
gotta be something.

378
00:28:27,305 --> 00:28:28,294
Like what?

379
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:51,452
<i>Well, hello there precious.</i>

380
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:53,258
<i>Look at you.</i>
<i>Look at you.</i>

381
00:28:53,331 --> 00:28:54,992
You're so cute,
I could just eat you up.

382
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:57,728
I could just eat you up.
Yes I could.

383
00:28:58,536 --> 00:28:59,503
<i>What's your name?</i>

384
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:00,560
Andrea.

385
00:29:00,638 --> 00:29:03,573
A beautiful name for
a beautiful baby.

386
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:07,343
Well, you have a
great day, Andrea.

387
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:08,242
Ok?

388
00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:10,338
You have a great day.
Yes you should.

389
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:13,248
You should have a good day,
that's what you should do.

390
00:29:13,318 --> 00:29:14,410
Okay.

391
00:29:19,457 --> 00:29:20,446
- Hi.
- Hi.

392
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:21,719
- Can I help you?
- Yeah.

393
00:29:21,793 --> 00:29:24,023
I was wondering if you had an
application I could fill out?

394
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:26,791
- Excuse me?
- A job application?

395
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:32,164
Uh, yes, I guess.

396
00:29:36,674 --> 00:29:37,800
OK, thanks.

397
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:39,810
I'll just fill this out
and get it back to you.

398
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:40,867
You do that.

399
00:29:50,221 --> 00:29:51,518
He's so good with them.

400
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:52,783
I know it.

401
00:29:52,857 --> 00:29:53,789
Thank God he's here.

402
00:29:53,858 --> 00:29:55,723
If I had to push that
merry-go-round one more time,

403
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:56,852
I'm going to vomit.

404
00:29:56,928 --> 00:29:58,828
It's like he
never gets tired.

405
00:29:58,897 --> 00:29:59,659
I know.

406
00:30:01,065 --> 00:30:02,293
How he does he do it?

407
00:30:02,367 --> 00:30:04,301
I mean, he must be
like a stay-at-home dad.

408
00:30:04,369 --> 00:30:06,098
Playground superman.

409
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:10,505
I wish Phil had the
time to be like that.

410
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:13,872
Which one is his?

411
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:15,344
Hmm...

412
00:30:15,413 --> 00:30:16,880
You know, I don't know.

413
00:30:16,948 --> 00:30:17,972
No?

414
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:18,845
Oh.

415
00:30:18,917 --> 00:30:21,750
Is it that little
blond boy there?

416
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,583
No, that's
Michael... he's Janie's.

417
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:24,713
Oh.

418
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:27,484
And that's Ruth's.

419
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:29,322
- Yeah.
- She's Kelly's.

420
00:30:30,428 --> 00:30:31,725
Huh.

421
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:34,030
I hope he didn't lose him.

422
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,633
Me, too.

423
00:30:38,903 --> 00:30:40,097
Well, I've got to go.

424
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:41,968
Lindsay's got a
doctor's appointment.

425
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:42,768
Oh.

426
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:45,002
She's got some bumps
on her whatsis.

427
00:30:45,076 --> 00:30:45,940
Oh.

428
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:47,272
See you on Wednesday, Mag?

429
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:48,107
OK.

430
00:31:04,095 --> 00:31:04,754
Paul?

431
00:31:05,263 --> 00:31:06,025
Sorry.

432
00:31:06,097 --> 00:31:08,156
Hi, I'm Maggie Butler.
Hi.

433
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:09,097
Paul Johnson.

434
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:11,533
I'm Tyler's mother.
You know, the little...

435
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:13,161
Of course, of course.

436
00:31:13,238 --> 00:31:14,865
He's such a sweet
little boy.

437
00:31:14,939 --> 00:31:16,236
Thank you.

438
00:31:17,075 --> 00:31:18,667
So which one's your son?

439
00:31:18,743 --> 00:31:20,574
I don't have a son.

440
00:31:20,645 --> 00:31:21,907
Oh.

441
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,174
Your daughter?

442
00:31:23,248 --> 00:31:24,306
Is she the..?

443
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:25,280
No.

444
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:27,443
I'm gay.
I don't have any kids.

445
00:31:28,853 --> 00:31:29,911
Oh.

446
00:31:29,988 --> 00:31:31,580
That's fine.

447
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:33,920
So who do you
bring to the park?

448
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:37,018
Your niece, or
nephew, or neighbor?

449
00:31:37,095 --> 00:31:39,393
I haven't been
bringing anyone.

450
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:43,265
I see.

451
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:47,764
Well, the kids are
waiting for me, so...

452
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:56,905
Tyler!

453
00:31:56,981 --> 00:31:59,677
Tyler, honey,
come here.

454
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:04,612
Dang it.

455
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:05,178
Tyler!

456
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:18,893
<i>At the same time.</i>
<i>All of them?</i>

457
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:21,063
Yeah. It was like something
out of The Twilight Zone.

458
00:32:21,139 --> 00:32:21,867
<i>Huh.</i>

459
00:32:23,374 --> 00:32:24,500
What?

460
00:32:24,575 --> 00:32:26,873
Well, honey, it hadn't
really occurred to me,

461
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,469
but you might
wanna rethink the whole...

462
00:32:28,546 --> 00:32:30,138
hanging-around-the-playground
thing.

463
00:32:30,214 --> 00:32:31,806
It's a little <i>Lolita,</i>
don't you think?

464
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:33,077
What's that supposed to mean?

465
00:32:33,151 --> 00:32:33,845
Nothin'.

466
00:32:33,918 --> 00:32:35,613
It's just-people might
get the wrong idea.

467
00:32:35,687 --> 00:32:36,551
What idea?

468
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,424
Look, I didn't come here
to talk about this, anyway.

469
00:32:40,491 --> 00:32:44,120
I want you to help me do up
a, um, you know, a resume.

470
00:32:44,195 --> 00:32:46,720
Alright, I can do that.
What's in it for me?

471
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:47,890
What do you want?

472
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:49,558
Don't ask.

473
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:51,261
Undying love?

474
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:52,360
That'll do.

475
00:32:56,274 --> 00:32:57,935
So, now?

476
00:33:00,044 --> 00:33:01,807
Sure, lunch is
overrated anyway.

477
00:33:01,879 --> 00:33:02,811
Just give me a second.

478
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:07,281
OK.
What's your objective?

479
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:08,080
I don't know.

480
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:09,244
Um...

481
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,287
to work with kids.

482
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:14,019
Paul... I know I
said this before,

483
00:33:14,092 --> 00:33:16,856
but you gonna have to be real careful
about this kind of thing.

484
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:19,692
It's just that people are weird
when it comes to their kids.

485
00:33:19,764 --> 00:33:20,822
What do you think I'm
gonna do, Russell?

486
00:33:20,898 --> 00:33:21,523
Eat them?

487
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,294
Of course not, Paul.
I didn't mean that.

488
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:24,994
It's just...

489
00:33:25,069 --> 00:33:26,593
Look, are you gonna
help me with this or not?

490
00:33:36,814 --> 00:33:37,678
Hi.

491
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:38,875
Remember me?

492
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:40,349
I certainly do.

493
00:33:40,418 --> 00:33:41,783
Oh, good.

494
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,480
I thought I'd
bring that back.

495
00:33:44,722 --> 00:33:45,484
Thank you.

496
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:47,114
Okay.

497
00:33:47,825 --> 00:33:48,519
Good.

498
00:34:01,906 --> 00:34:02,770
Hello?

499
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:03,932
<i>Hi, it's me.</i>

500
00:34:04,008 --> 00:34:05,566
Oh, hi.

501
00:34:05,643 --> 00:34:07,167
<i>Don't sound so excited.</i>

502
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:10,942
No, I just thought you might be
calling about a job or something.

503
00:34:11,015 --> 00:34:14,451
<i>Oh. Sorry.</i>
<i>Wanna go out and get drunk?</i>

504
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:18,979
No, I think I'm gonna call
my folks, hit the sack.

505
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:21,423
<i>- How are your folks?</i>
- They're good.

506
00:34:21,492 --> 00:34:23,892
Dad's gonna retire
from the pharmacy soon,

507
00:34:23,961 --> 00:34:26,293
and Mom's been taking Greek.

508
00:34:26,364 --> 00:34:27,422
<i>Greek?</i>

509
00:34:27,498 --> 00:34:29,898
<i>I thought you said she was</i>
<i>taking cooking classes.</i>

510
00:34:29,967 --> 00:34:33,027
Greek cooking.
You didn't let me finish.

511
00:34:33,104 --> 00:34:36,835
Well it's getting late.
I better call them so...

512
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:38,068
<i>Okay.</i>

513
00:34:38,142 --> 00:34:39,370
<i>Talk to you tomorrow.</i>

514
00:34:39,444 --> 00:34:40,308
Okay.

515
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:40,867
Bye.

516
00:35:01,332 --> 00:35:02,731
<i>Bathroom is clean.</i>

517
00:35:05,837 --> 00:35:09,671
<i>Tyler's asleep and...</i>

518
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,207
diaphragm in.

519
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:12,640
Um...

520
00:35:14,745 --> 00:35:16,804
Okay Phil, it's Wednesday...

521
00:35:29,827 --> 00:35:32,295
<i>So tell me Dr. Baker, with</i>
<i>reports of child abductions...</i>

522
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:35,093
<i>reaching an all-time high,</i>
<i>what are the most common...</i>

523
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:37,828
<i>characteristics of a child</i>
<i>molester that our viewers...</i>

524
00:35:37,902 --> 00:35:39,460
<i>should be on the</i>
<i>look-out for?</i>

525
00:35:39,537 --> 00:35:42,904
<i>Pedophiles tend to share</i>
<i>four major characteristics.</i>

526
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:47,172
<i>One, they are usually male,</i>
<i>over 25 and often unmarried.</i>

527
00:35:47,245 --> 00:35:49,645
I'm gay, I don't
have any kids.

528
00:35:49,714 --> 00:35:52,478
<i>Two, they are socially</i>
<i>awkward with adults.</i>

529
00:35:53,885 --> 00:35:56,046
<i>Three, they are skilled</i>
<i>at relating to children.</i>

530
00:35:57,855 --> 00:36:00,483
<i>And four, they tend to</i>
<i>refer to children as "pure",</i>

531
00:36:00,558 --> 00:36:02,025
<i>"innocent," or "sweet".</i>

532
00:36:02,093 --> 00:36:03,924
Such a sweet little boy.

533
00:37:27,945 --> 00:37:29,139
Hello?

534
00:37:29,213 --> 00:37:30,805
<i>Mr. Johnson?</i>

535
00:37:30,881 --> 00:37:32,075
Mm-hmm...

536
00:37:32,149 --> 00:37:33,844
<i>Hi, my name is Grant Sweet.</i>

537
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:37,513
I manage the Toys for
Boys 'n Girls at the mall...

538
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:38,885
Yeah?

539
00:37:38,956 --> 00:37:41,516
And I do have an opening,
but I should tell you...

540
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,583
I think you may
be overqualified...

541
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:45,754
<i>I need a stock boy.</i>

542
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:47,388
Stock boy.
A boy who stocks.

543
00:37:47,465 --> 00:37:48,124
I can do that.

544
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:50,895
We call this the jungle area.

545
00:37:50,968 --> 00:37:52,560
That's the little
princess area.

546
00:37:52,637 --> 00:37:53,968
Those are hats.

547
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,964
We're not here to play, Paul.

548
00:37:58,643 --> 00:38:00,201
This is a toy store.

549
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:02,337
Got it. Right.
No playing.

550
00:38:02,413 --> 00:38:05,211
Now remember it's
"Toys for Boys 'n Girls"...

551
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:06,773
not "and Girls."

552
00:38:06,851 --> 00:38:09,217
- Boys 'n Girls?
- Boys 'n Girls.

553
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:10,549
Like boysenberry.

554
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:12,521
Boys 'n Girls.
Boys 'n Girls.

555
00:38:15,326 --> 00:38:17,260
Oh, I've got to
get Lindsay home;

556
00:38:17,328 --> 00:38:19,262
it's almost time for
"Magic School Bus."

557
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:20,729
Isn't she a little young for that?

558
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:22,322
Oh, she doesn't
watch it, I do.

559
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,298
Bye.

560
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:28,400
Can you say, "Paul"?

561
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:29,666
Paul.

562
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:32,538
Can you say, "Uncle Paul"?

563
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:34,441
- No.
- C'mon.

564
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:37,003
Uncle Paul, say "Uncle Paul".

565
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:37,877
No.

566
00:38:40,184 --> 00:38:41,845
She's not much of a talker.

567
00:38:41,919 --> 00:38:43,011
Yeah?

568
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:45,180
Not like me,
I'm a chatterbox.

569
00:38:45,256 --> 00:38:47,224
- Oh yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

570
00:38:47,291 --> 00:38:48,553
Squawk, squawk, squawk!

571
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:49,524
Right, honey?

572
00:38:49,593 --> 00:38:50,787
Squawk, squawk, squawk!

573
00:38:50,861 --> 00:38:52,419
Squawk!

574
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:53,656
Buk-buk-bgok!

575
00:38:56,033 --> 00:38:56,727
Squawk.

576
00:38:57,535 --> 00:38:59,901
Coo. Coo. Coo.
Coo. Coo.

577
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:01,968
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

578
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:04,337
Gobble, gobble, gobble!
Gobble, gobble, gobble!

579
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:06,407
Polly wanna cracker?

580
00:39:09,747 --> 00:39:12,307
OK. Come on, honey.
It's time to go.

581
00:39:12,383 --> 00:39:14,408
We'll see you
tomorrow. Bye.

582
00:39:14,485 --> 00:39:16,282
Paul can you save my toys?

583
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:17,218
Sure.

584
00:39:17,288 --> 00:39:18,949
- OK. Bye.
- Bye.

585
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,684
<i>Bye, honey, we'll</i>
<i>see you tomorrow.</i>

586
00:39:20,758 --> 00:39:22,282
What are you doing?

587
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:28,130
I thought we could go out
and celebrate my new job.

588
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,826
Oh, give me a second.

589
00:39:31,802 --> 00:39:33,633
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up,
hurry up, hurry up.

590
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:34,728
Come on.

591
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:40,209
Well, congratulations, honey.
I'm very proud of you.

592
00:39:40,277 --> 00:39:42,939
I bet you're gonna be the best
stockboy that place has ever seen.

593
00:39:43,013 --> 00:39:44,173
Thank you.

594
00:39:44,248 --> 00:39:47,274
And thank you for helping
me get my act together.

595
00:39:47,351 --> 00:39:48,682
<i>You're the best.</i>

596
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,613
I love you...
Russell Trotter.

597
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:03,064
Well, I gotta go.
I gotta work in the morning!

598
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:05,398
But um, maybe we'll have
dinner tomorrow.

599
00:40:05,469 --> 00:40:06,697
Yeah, great.
Yeah, please.

600
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,953
Hey... look what
this one can do.

601
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:40,163
I saw the cutest
thing yesterday...

602
00:40:40,237 --> 00:40:44,003
Do you remember that guy
from a few weeks ago?

603
00:40:44,074 --> 00:40:47,100
The one we saw at the other place?
You know the one...

604
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:49,146
The one we couldn't
figure out which kid was his?

605
00:40:49,213 --> 00:40:50,475
Yeah, that's him.

606
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:54,348
So he's in the
sandbox with Lindsay and Ashley.

607
00:40:54,418 --> 00:40:55,180
Yeah.

608
00:40:55,252 --> 00:40:58,016
They're playing something,
I don't know what.

609
00:40:58,088 --> 00:40:58,986
Right.

610
00:40:59,056 --> 00:41:04,460
And I go over to get Lindsay
to take her home for her nap...

611
00:41:04,528 --> 00:41:09,522
And he, this is so cute,
he is trying to get Lindsay...

612
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:13,400
to call him "Uncle Paul."
Isn't that cute?

613
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:14,631
Uncle Paul.

614
00:41:14,705 --> 00:41:16,332
No, that's not cute.

615
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:18,967
That's not cute.
That's terrifying.

616
00:41:19,043 --> 00:41:21,273
He doesn't have any children.

617
00:41:21,345 --> 00:41:22,835
What?

618
00:41:22,913 --> 00:41:25,279
No kids.
I asked him.

619
00:41:25,349 --> 00:41:28,011
Well, who's he been
bringing to the playground?

620
00:41:28,085 --> 00:41:30,019
No one.

621
00:41:30,087 --> 00:41:32,146
Then why is he there?

622
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:33,485
Think, Susan.

623
00:41:41,465 --> 00:41:42,762
Oh, my God.

624
00:41:45,302 --> 00:41:46,360
Yeah.

625
00:41:48,472 --> 00:41:51,805
On your mark, get set, go!

626
00:41:52,576 --> 00:41:53,201
You fake them.

627
00:41:53,277 --> 00:41:54,175
Go. Go.

628
00:41:54,812 --> 00:41:55,870
Go. Go.

629
00:41:57,715 --> 00:41:58,613
Aah!

630
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:00,744
Oh!

631
00:42:01,819 --> 00:42:02,513
Oh.

632
00:42:04,788 --> 00:42:05,482
Who's next?

633
00:42:10,628 --> 00:42:12,095
Honey, I'm going
to go to the mall...

634
00:42:12,162 --> 00:42:13,254
do you need anything?

635
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:18,134
OK. C'mon, Tyler,
come on, honey.

636
00:42:19,503 --> 00:42:20,527
Let's go shopping.

637
00:42:20,604 --> 00:42:22,071
Maybe we can buy
Daddy a personality.

638
00:42:22,139 --> 00:42:23,163
OK?

639
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,434
<i>Maybe not.</i>

640
00:42:31,415 --> 00:42:32,279
What?

641
00:42:33,484 --> 00:42:34,917
No, honey.
Remember?

642
00:42:34,985 --> 00:42:36,145
It's not a toy day.

643
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,847
It's a shopping-for-a-
birthday-present-day.

644
00:42:37,922 --> 00:42:39,287
OK?
We talked about that, sweetie.

645
00:42:39,356 --> 00:42:41,551
It has wheels.
It does have

646
00:42:41,625 --> 00:42:42,819
wheels. It's green and pretty.

647
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:44,918
Look at these trains.
He'd like that huh?

648
00:42:44,995 --> 00:42:46,485
- He would like this.
- Yeah?

649
00:42:47,164 --> 00:42:48,290
La, la, la, la.

650
00:42:48,365 --> 00:42:50,356
- I have to go pee pee.
- What?

651
00:42:50,434 --> 00:42:52,163
I have to go potty.

652
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:53,726
Oh, um.

653
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:01,378
<i>We'll go potty.</i>

654
00:43:03,447 --> 00:43:04,141
Excuse me.

655
00:43:04,214 --> 00:43:06,205
I need you to get your
manager right away.

656
00:43:06,283 --> 00:43:08,342
- Now. Now.
- OK. Sure.

657
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:09,408
Come on sweetheart.

658
00:43:13,557 --> 00:43:14,319
Dammit.

659
00:43:15,225 --> 00:43:16,522
I know, you're right.

660
00:43:17,161 --> 00:43:18,128
Hold on, honey.

661
00:43:19,363 --> 00:43:21,228
Hold on, we're almost there.

662
00:43:29,974 --> 00:43:31,032
You quit?

663
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:33,941
Yeah.
Well, sort of.

664
00:43:34,011 --> 00:43:35,740
Mr. Sweet called me into
his office and told me...

665
00:43:35,813 --> 00:43:37,508
I had to stop talking to the kids.

666
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:40,246
- And?
- And I told him that I didn't...

667
00:43:40,317 --> 00:43:42,842
want his stupid stockboy job if
I couldn't talk to the kids.

668
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,854
He said, "Too bad."
I said, "Fine" and I quit.

669
00:43:44,922 --> 00:43:47,550
He said that was
probably a good thing anyway.

670
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,456
Jesus. I'm sorry.

671
00:43:49,526 --> 00:43:51,391
Why doesn't he want you
talking to the kids?

672
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:52,360
I don't know.

673
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:55,555
But listen, um,
I have this idea.

674
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:57,430
- Tell me what you think.
- OK.

675
00:43:57,501 --> 00:44:00,163
I'm gonna register with
a babysitting service.

676
00:44:00,237 --> 00:44:01,636
Uh-huh.

677
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:10,708
Can I help you, sir?

678
00:44:10,781 --> 00:44:12,578
I'm here for the interview.

679
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,709
Sir, you don't have to
interview to hire...

680
00:44:14,785 --> 00:44:16,980
one of Sitter-Spin's Sitters.

681
00:44:17,054 --> 00:44:18,385
No, I'm...

682
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:24,351
I'm sorry, I must
have misunderstood the ad.

683
00:44:24,428 --> 00:44:26,453
Never can be too careful.

684
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:27,519
<i>Of course.</i>

685
00:44:30,134 --> 00:44:33,399
I almost envy you
girls... getting to meet...

686
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:37,907
all those different kids, play
with all those different kids.

687
00:44:37,975 --> 00:44:40,375
Hold 'em on your lap,
tell 'em stories.

688
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:43,278
Tuck them in to bed.

689
00:44:47,985 --> 00:44:49,680
Oh, Sitter-Spin!

690
00:44:49,753 --> 00:44:51,118
I just got that.

691
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:53,383
OK, well.

692
00:45:01,131 --> 00:45:03,156
Well, that's annoying.

693
00:45:03,233 --> 00:45:05,997
I don't think the whole
corporate babysitting thing...

694
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:07,935
is really the way to
go for me, you know?

695
00:45:08,005 --> 00:45:10,599
I'm more individual than
that, don't you think?

696
00:45:11,475 --> 00:45:14,911
And the thing is, nobody wants
to do anything about anything.

697
00:45:14,978 --> 00:45:19,711
It's like the guy at the toy
store didn't even believe me.

698
00:45:19,783 --> 00:45:23,344
He didn't even want to talk to the
guy until I pressed the issue.

699
00:45:24,855 --> 00:45:27,346
I mean, everyone just sits around
waiting for someone else...

700
00:45:27,424 --> 00:45:28,721
to take care of it.

701
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:33,792
Well, I'm not gonna
be that other guy...

702
00:45:33,864 --> 00:45:36,025
the one who's waiting, I mean.

703
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:37,692
I mean, no, I am not.

704
00:47:00,384 --> 00:47:01,851
Excuse me, do you know
what happened to...

705
00:47:01,919 --> 00:47:04,285
the babysitting flyers
that were up there?

706
00:47:04,354 --> 00:47:05,946
We need to speak to
someone immediately.

707
00:47:06,023 --> 00:47:08,082
- I'll be right with you.
- Oh, great. Thank you.

708
00:47:15,132 --> 00:47:16,793
Um, Mag?

709
00:47:16,867 --> 00:47:17,856
Yeah?

710
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:21,535
Um, I'm not so sure
this is a good idea.

711
00:47:21,605 --> 00:47:22,435
What?

712
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:31,570
He seems like, I don't know,
he seems like a nice guy.

713
00:47:31,648 --> 00:47:34,549
That's what makes
him dangerous. OK?

714
00:47:34,618 --> 00:47:35,812
Just don't be so naive.

715
00:47:35,886 --> 00:47:37,319
This is how these people work.

716
00:47:39,289 --> 00:47:42,952
But he was playing
with Lindsay...

717
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:46,257
and we did, um, bird calls.

718
00:47:47,731 --> 00:47:48,857
Bird calls?

719
00:47:48,932 --> 00:47:50,365
You did bird calls?

720
00:47:50,434 --> 00:47:52,732
And you think that is some
sort of character assessment?

721
00:47:52,803 --> 00:47:54,600
Susan, look at me.
You need to look at me.

722
00:47:54,671 --> 00:47:55,535
Look at me.

723
00:47:55,606 --> 00:48:00,441
I want you to listen very
carefully... that is exactly...

724
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:03,377
the kind of thing that
a pedophile would do.

725
00:48:03,447 --> 00:48:05,938
They lure you in.

726
00:48:06,016 --> 00:48:08,678
They, they earn your trust.

727
00:48:08,752 --> 00:48:11,653
Take advantage of
your good nature.

728
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:13,519
And then,
once you're sure,

729
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:15,683
once you've finally
let down your guard,

730
00:48:15,759 --> 00:48:21,095
and you are relaxed,
that's when he's gonna move in...

731
00:48:21,164 --> 00:48:22,358
and hurt your child.

732
00:48:25,636 --> 00:48:28,434
He's laying the groundwork
for something really terrible.

733
00:48:28,505 --> 00:48:30,973
You know this for a fact?
You have proof?

734
00:48:31,041 --> 00:48:32,338
He's gay.

735
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:33,341
He's single.

736
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:35,776
He hangs around
the playground. Alone.

737
00:48:35,846 --> 00:48:37,837
He fits the profile.

738
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:41,783
He says right here, "I know
what your children need!"

739
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:45,213
I'll tell you what, why don't
I take one of these flyers...

740
00:48:45,289 --> 00:48:47,382
and I'll pay our
little pervert a visit.

741
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:50,757
Excellent.
Thank you so much.

742
00:48:50,827 --> 00:48:52,590
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

743
00:48:52,663 --> 00:48:55,029
- Bye, ladies.
- Thank you, sir.

744
00:49:01,204 --> 00:49:04,401
I have been picking these
up all over town...

745
00:49:04,474 --> 00:49:06,305
the last couple of days.

746
00:49:06,376 --> 00:49:09,140
I just have to say,
I'm very concerned for...

747
00:49:09,212 --> 00:49:11,373
the safety of our children.

748
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:15,578
<i>As some of you know, this man</i>
<i>has been seen coming alone...</i>

749
00:49:15,652 --> 00:49:18,678
<i>to the playgrounds,</i>
<i>playing with our children...</i>

750
00:49:18,755 --> 00:49:20,188
<i>and trying to</i>
<i>persuade them...</i>

751
00:49:20,257 --> 00:49:22,020
<i>to call him "Uncle Paul".</i>

752
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:26,595
I think it's clear
what we have here.

753
00:49:26,663 --> 00:49:29,860
<i>Paul Johnson is a</i>
<i>sexual predator.</i>

754
00:49:29,933 --> 00:49:31,457
<i>And he needs to be stopped.</i>

755
00:49:32,869 --> 00:49:38,307
Now we contacted the police,
and after following up,

756
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:40,673
I found out... they did nothing.

757
00:49:41,578 --> 00:49:44,103
If the police won't do
anything, what can we do?

758
00:49:44,181 --> 00:49:47,150
Good question.
What can we do?

759
00:49:47,217 --> 00:49:48,844
What should we do?

760
00:49:48,919 --> 00:49:51,717
Just wait around until he
lures one of our children...

761
00:49:51,788 --> 00:49:53,346
back to his house?

762
00:49:53,423 --> 00:49:54,947
I don't think so.

763
00:49:55,025 --> 00:49:56,322
Take precautions?

764
00:49:56,393 --> 00:49:57,587
<i>Absolutely.</i>

765
00:49:57,661 --> 00:50:00,061
<i>But that is not enough.</i>

766
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:01,188
Listen...

767
00:50:01,264 --> 00:50:05,564
Jesus! what's with the
get-up, Homo the Clown?

768
00:50:05,635 --> 00:50:07,102
What do you think?

769
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:08,398
Pretty good, huh?

770
00:50:08,472 --> 00:50:10,940
I thought it might present
more job opportunities...

771
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:12,737
I see.
This is a career move?

772
00:50:13,276 --> 00:50:15,073
Here's what I propose.

773
00:50:15,145 --> 00:50:18,342
I propose a city-wide
awareness campaign.

774
00:50:18,415 --> 00:50:19,507
Here, here.

775
00:50:21,318 --> 00:50:22,945
I always wanted to say that.

776
00:50:25,555 --> 00:50:27,352
What do you think
about adopting?

777
00:50:27,424 --> 00:50:29,392
Me, adopting?

778
00:50:29,459 --> 00:50:32,656
You want to start a city-wide
"awareness campaign"...

779
00:50:32,729 --> 00:50:33,991
about a pedophile?

780
00:50:34,064 --> 00:50:36,294
You want to adopt a baby?

781
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:37,663
Exactly.

782
00:50:37,734 --> 00:50:39,793
Wow, that's pretty serious.

783
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:42,634
Why can't I adopt a baby?
Gay men do it all the time.

784
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:44,003
What proof do you have?

785
00:50:44,074 --> 00:50:47,009
He doesn't have children, and
he's hanging out in playground...

786
00:50:47,077 --> 00:50:49,102
Have you thought
this thing through, Paul?

787
00:50:49,179 --> 00:50:50,669
<i>Have you thought about</i>
<i>how something like that...</i>

788
00:50:50,747 --> 00:50:52,977
will completely change your life?

789
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:55,610
So you're doing all
this based on a hunch?

790
00:50:55,685 --> 00:50:57,710
He fits the profile.

791
00:50:57,788 --> 00:51:02,191
Plus I saw him take a little
girl into the bathroom...

792
00:51:02,259 --> 00:51:04,750
<i>at Toys for Boys 'n</i>
<i>Girls where he works.</i>

793
00:51:04,828 --> 00:51:07,456
I mean, it's obvious
what's going on here.

794
00:51:07,531 --> 00:51:09,863
What's going on here is
you're out of your mind.

795
00:51:11,768 --> 00:51:13,998
You know, Leslie,
I think that you should leave.

796
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:15,060
I gotta go.

797
00:51:15,138 --> 00:51:16,435
You and me both.

798
00:51:16,506 --> 00:51:17,564
What?

799
00:51:17,641 --> 00:51:19,165
He fits the profile!

800
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:20,971
I just wish you
could understand...

801
00:51:21,044 --> 00:51:22,807
how important this is to me.

802
00:51:22,879 --> 00:51:26,246
Well I'm just glad that all
of you care enough to see...

803
00:51:26,316 --> 00:51:27,840
<i>what is important here.</i>

804
00:51:31,822 --> 00:51:33,687
Hi... hi.

805
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:36,920
Uh, um, I'm, um,
interested in adopting.

806
00:51:36,993 --> 00:51:37,982
I see.

807
00:51:38,061 --> 00:51:39,392
Do you have an appointment?

808
00:51:39,463 --> 00:51:42,159
No, no, I don't.
Is that a problem?

809
00:51:42,232 --> 00:51:43,392
It's not a problem if
you don't mind coming...

810
00:51:43,467 --> 00:51:46,095
another day when you do have one.

811
00:51:46,169 --> 00:51:48,364
Oh, OK, then.

812
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:53,640
I'd like to
make an appointment.

813
00:51:53,710 --> 00:52:00,377
Ok, we have an opening the
12th of next month, at 2 PM.

814
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:01,644
Next month?

815
00:52:01,718 --> 00:52:03,845
You'll need to provide
proof of income,

816
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:05,649
plus documentation of...

817
00:52:05,722 --> 00:52:08,555
I'm sorry, proof of income?

818
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:09,751
Why?

819
00:52:09,826 --> 00:52:12,386
You do have a job, don't you?

820
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:18,465
Well, actually,
not right now.

821
00:52:18,535 --> 00:52:19,433
I'm...

822
00:52:19,503 --> 00:52:20,765
changing...

823
00:52:20,837 --> 00:52:21,997
things.

824
00:52:23,707 --> 00:52:25,004
I'm thinking of
becoming a clown.

825
00:52:25,075 --> 00:52:26,007
Mmm...

826
00:52:26,076 --> 00:52:27,600
Explains the shirt.

827
00:52:27,677 --> 00:52:31,135
But I should have things
all worked out soon...

828
00:52:31,214 --> 00:52:32,545
so the 12th?

829
00:52:32,616 --> 00:52:34,982
Let's not waste any more
of each other's time.

830
00:52:35,051 --> 00:52:37,349
There's really no reason to
schedule you until...

831
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:40,446
you can meet some
very basic requirements.

832
00:52:40,524 --> 00:52:45,154
The process here is very extensive
and it's clear that you...

833
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:53,492
<i>Have a nice day.</i>

834
00:53:03,747 --> 00:53:04,839
Hi.

835
00:53:04,915 --> 00:53:05,745
Hello, sir.

836
00:53:05,815 --> 00:53:07,510
I live in the building and
I am selling candy...

837
00:53:07,584 --> 00:53:10,883
to raise money for after-school
activities such as sports and band.

838
00:53:10,954 --> 00:53:13,149
<i>These activities were</i>
<i>designed to keep children...</i>

839
00:53:13,223 --> 00:53:15,589
<i>off the streets and stop</i>
<i>them from using drugs.</i>

840
00:53:15,659 --> 00:53:17,490
Would you like to keep
children off the streets...

841
00:53:17,561 --> 00:53:19,188
and stop them using drugs?

842
00:53:19,262 --> 00:53:20,194
I thought so.

843
00:53:20,263 --> 00:53:22,197
Would you be interested
in buying a candy bar...

844
00:53:22,265 --> 00:53:23,732
or a box of chocolate?

845
00:53:25,268 --> 00:53:26,792
Uh, yeah sure.

846
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:28,462
Come on in.

847
00:53:34,578 --> 00:53:37,308
I'm kinda broke, but I can
probably afford a candy bar.

848
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:38,677
This one is good.

849
00:53:38,748 --> 00:53:40,181
Which one is your favorite?

850
00:53:41,985 --> 00:53:42,952
This one.

851
00:53:44,921 --> 00:53:47,185
You uh, had dinner yet?

852
00:53:47,257 --> 00:53:48,189
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

853
00:53:48,258 --> 00:53:49,850
- Promise?
- Promise.

854
00:53:49,926 --> 00:53:52,622
I'll take two of those then,
one for me, one for you.

855
00:53:52,696 --> 00:53:53,526
OK, cool.

856
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:57,562
Thank you.

857
00:54:02,172 --> 00:54:03,002
Come on in.

858
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:06,508
Wow.

859
00:54:07,377 --> 00:54:08,867
You like to paint?

860
00:54:08,945 --> 00:54:09,775
Yeah.

861
00:54:09,846 --> 00:54:11,780
Yeah?
What's your name?

862
00:54:11,848 --> 00:54:12,644
Simon.

863
00:54:12,716 --> 00:54:14,343
- I'm Paul.
- Hi Paul.

864
00:54:15,986 --> 00:54:17,180
You want to paint
something, Simon?

865
00:54:19,189 --> 00:54:19,814
<i>Coming.</i>

866
00:54:22,692 --> 00:54:23,488
<i>Yeah?</i>

867
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:25,585
I'm sorry to bother you.
Have you seen my son?

868
00:54:26,696 --> 00:54:27,856
Hey, hey!!

869
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:29,558
You're supposed to
paint the canvas...

870
00:54:29,633 --> 00:54:31,464
- Aaaah!
- Aaaah!

871
00:54:32,135 --> 00:54:33,159
<i>Simon!</i>

872
00:54:34,137 --> 00:54:35,069
Simon!

873
00:54:38,041 --> 00:54:38,837
Simon?

874
00:54:48,051 --> 00:54:50,952
Sorry to bother you.
I've checked every apartment.

875
00:54:51,021 --> 00:54:53,080
I'm looking for my son.
Have you seen him?

876
00:54:53,156 --> 00:54:54,418
Simon?

877
00:54:54,491 --> 00:54:55,924
Yeah, is he here?

878
00:54:55,992 --> 00:54:57,687
Yeah, he's right there.

879
00:54:57,761 --> 00:54:59,092
Simon.

880
00:54:59,162 --> 00:55:00,629
What the hell are you doing?

881
00:55:00,697 --> 00:55:01,493
<i>What?</i>

882
00:55:01,564 --> 00:55:03,555
You don't go into strange
people's apartments!

883
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:04,759
Sorry.

884
00:55:04,834 --> 00:55:06,563
And what are you thinking?

885
00:55:06,636 --> 00:55:08,866
You're an adult,
for Christ sakes!

886
00:55:08,938 --> 00:55:09,563
Sorry.

887
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:11,004
He was selling candy,
and he saw my paints,

888
00:55:11,074 --> 00:55:12,701
Stay away from my kid.

889
00:55:12,776 --> 00:55:13,970
You understand me?

890
00:55:14,044 --> 00:55:15,841
You come near him again and
I will break your neck...

891
00:55:19,683 --> 00:55:20,945
<i>Oh my God.</i>

892
00:55:21,017 --> 00:55:22,780
I mean, we were
just painting.

893
00:55:22,852 --> 00:55:25,480
You invited some kid you don't
know into your apartment;

894
00:55:25,555 --> 00:55:27,648
of course
his dad freaked out.

895
00:55:27,724 --> 00:55:29,157
We weren't doing
anything wrong!

896
00:55:29,225 --> 00:55:30,692
I'm not saying
you were, Paul,

897
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:33,058
but you don't bring kids
into your apartment.

898
00:55:33,129 --> 00:55:36,394
God Almighty, no wonder everybody
thinks you're some sort of psycho!

899
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:38,099
What?

900
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:40,398
You are acting like
this first-class idiot.

901
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:43,837
I swear, you haven't got the sense
that God gave a lawnmower.

902
00:55:43,907 --> 00:55:48,503
You don't invite children you
don't know into your house.

903
00:55:48,578 --> 00:55:50,671
And you don't adopt a child
when you're not able...

904
00:55:50,747 --> 00:55:52,305
to provide a home for him.

905
00:55:52,382 --> 00:55:55,510
And no one, no one, is going
to call you to babysit...

906
00:55:55,585 --> 00:55:57,519
their children 'cause
you're passing out some...

907
00:55:57,587 --> 00:55:59,282
stupid flyers on the street.

908
00:56:00,557 --> 00:56:01,649
I don't need you to
talk to me that way.

909
00:56:01,725 --> 00:56:02,851
I've got a
mother for that.

910
00:56:02,926 --> 00:56:04,518
I don't know why I expected
anything different.

911
00:56:04,594 --> 00:56:07,529
This is just another in the long
list of things you don't see.

912
00:56:07,597 --> 00:56:09,690
What?
What don't I see?

913
00:56:09,766 --> 00:56:10,391
Oh, come on, Paul.

914
00:56:10,467 --> 00:56:11,957
No.
Tell me. What?

915
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:13,229
<i>- You wanna know?</i>
- Yeah.

916
00:56:13,303 --> 00:56:14,600
You really want to know?

917
00:56:14,671 --> 00:56:15,865
Yeah.
I really want to know.

918
00:56:20,276 --> 00:56:22,608
I'm in love with you, Paul.

919
00:56:22,679 --> 00:56:25,011
Doesn't that knock you
ass over tea kettle?

920
00:56:28,918 --> 00:56:29,885
Well?

921
00:56:32,756 --> 00:56:35,088
I can't.
I can't.

922
00:56:35,792 --> 00:56:38,590
Oh great go ahead, run
away, go eat some donuts.

923
00:56:38,661 --> 00:56:41,186
Are you gonna paint
the real world away?

924
00:56:41,264 --> 00:56:43,357
Do me a favor, stay out
of the goddamn playground.

925
00:56:43,433 --> 00:56:44,900
You're gonna get arrested.

926
00:56:44,968 --> 00:56:46,230
Go fuck yourself.

927
00:56:46,302 --> 00:56:48,236
What do you think I've been
doing all this whole time?

928
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:51,929
What are you looking at?

929
00:56:53,042 --> 00:56:54,304
He hasn't had his medication.

930
00:57:48,198 --> 00:57:50,132
Prepositions don't belong
at the end of sentences.

931
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:25,065
You keep standing in
the road like that,

932
00:58:25,134 --> 00:58:26,260
you're gonna get hit.

933
00:58:26,836 --> 00:58:29,737
I want you to do a story
on a child molester.

934
00:58:29,806 --> 00:58:30,738
I know that...

935
00:58:30,807 --> 00:58:31,831
Yes, I'll hold.

936
00:58:35,879 --> 00:58:36,868
What's that?

937
00:58:37,647 --> 00:58:39,342
Sock Paul!

938
00:58:39,415 --> 00:58:41,542
It's our rallying cry.

939
00:58:42,952 --> 00:58:44,920
Sock Paul?

940
00:58:44,988 --> 00:58:46,751
Mm-hmm.
And look.

941
00:58:49,392 --> 00:58:50,723
And what are these?

942
00:58:50,793 --> 00:58:52,317
Sock Paul Socks!

943
00:58:52,695 --> 00:58:55,255
Sock Paul Socks.
I see.

944
00:58:55,331 --> 00:58:58,391
I thought we needed a slogan.

945
00:58:58,468 --> 00:58:59,230
You know?

946
00:58:59,302 --> 00:59:00,963
Sock Paul!
Sock Paul!

947
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:05,935
You know, that's
not a bad idea.

948
00:59:06,009 --> 00:59:07,636
That's a terrible idea.

949
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:10,873
We need a slogan, a catch phrase...

950
00:59:10,947 --> 00:59:15,441
We need our "Just Say No."
Let me think about it.

951
00:59:15,518 --> 00:59:18,817
Yes, I'm here.
No that's fine.

952
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:20,719
Yes send a reporter,
any reporter.

953
00:59:21,925 --> 00:59:22,949
Working late?

954
00:59:23,026 --> 00:59:24,994
Way to meet those
incentive plans, Russell.

955
00:59:25,061 --> 00:59:26,585
You know I live for
incentive plans.

956
00:59:26,663 --> 00:59:28,153
Well, don't stay too long.

957
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:30,062
All work and no play
makes Russell...

958
00:59:30,133 --> 00:59:31,464
A dull boy, I know.

959
00:59:31,534 --> 00:59:33,934
Well, I was gonna say, "late
for work in the morning",

960
00:59:34,003 --> 00:59:35,527
but that works, too.

961
00:59:36,873 --> 00:59:37,771
Uh, it's a mirror!

962
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:39,569
Yes, but what you see?
What do you see, Paul?

963
00:59:39,642 --> 00:59:40,404
What do you see?

964
00:59:40,476 --> 00:59:41,909
- In a mirror?
- Yes!

965
00:59:41,978 --> 00:59:43,445
- Uh...
- Come on!

966
00:59:43,513 --> 00:59:45,913
It's, uh,
it's, um, your face?

967
00:59:45,982 --> 00:59:46,676
Time!

968
00:59:48,952 --> 00:59:50,044
It's reflection.

969
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:53,321
Oh.
Reflection.

970
00:59:53,389 --> 00:59:54,253
Sorry.

971
00:59:56,359 --> 00:59:57,257
Karen?

972
00:59:57,327 --> 00:59:59,318
Hi, Karen it's Maggie.

973
00:59:59,395 --> 01:00:01,158
Butler.

974
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:03,061
Well, Hampton.

975
01:00:04,233 --> 01:00:05,632
From Catholic High?

976
01:00:06,336 --> 01:00:07,303
Right.

977
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:09,201
Good, yes.
How are you?

978
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:13,470
Listen, Karen I know that you're
on the Entertainment Beat,

979
01:00:13,543 --> 01:00:15,704
but I could really
use a favor.

980
01:00:15,778 --> 01:00:16,608
What's she saying?

981
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:21,114
Well, I'm having a press
conference here tomorrow...

982
01:00:21,184 --> 01:00:24,676
to alert people to a child
molester in our area.

983
01:00:25,688 --> 01:00:27,349
It would be great if you
could send somebody...

984
01:00:27,423 --> 01:00:29,288
anybody from the station
to cover it.

985
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:31,922
- What?
- What?

986
01:00:33,997 --> 01:00:36,192
Of course I have proof.

987
01:00:36,265 --> 01:00:37,960
Of course I do.

988
01:00:38,701 --> 01:00:40,669
I saw it.

989
01:00:40,737 --> 01:00:42,295
Yeah, I um...

990
01:00:42,372 --> 01:00:45,102
I saw him take a little
girl into the bathroom...

991
01:00:45,174 --> 01:00:48,109
at the toy store where he works.

992
01:00:48,177 --> 01:00:52,705
And then when she came out,
she was crying.

993
01:00:52,782 --> 01:00:54,943
I know, it's awful...

994
01:00:55,018 --> 01:00:56,417
You did?

995
01:00:58,488 --> 01:01:00,854
Oh, someone from the
news desk would be great.

996
01:01:00,923 --> 01:01:02,823
Thank you so much.

997
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:08,426
Everything's gonna
be alright, Paul.

998
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:10,056
Yeah, I know.

999
01:01:10,133 --> 01:01:11,760
What are you
doing tomorrow?

1000
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:14,132
Maybe go out to the gorge
and go for a hike or something.

1001
01:01:14,203 --> 01:01:15,670
Want some company?

1002
01:01:15,738 --> 01:01:17,569
No, I don't think so.

1003
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:18,800
It's just...

1004
01:01:18,875 --> 01:01:21,537
everyone's always telling
me I need to grow up,

1005
01:01:21,611 --> 01:01:24,842
think things through, so
that's what I'm gonna do.

1006
01:01:24,914 --> 01:01:27,883
<i>Take a little time by myself</i>
<i>and think things through.</i>

1007
01:01:45,435 --> 01:01:48,529
<i>Hello, I am Maggie</i>
<i>Butler and I am a mother.</i>

1008
01:01:48,604 --> 01:01:51,869
<i>I'd like to thank you</i>
<i>all for coming out today.</i>

1009
01:01:51,941 --> 01:01:56,674
We're here for a very
important cause; our children.

1010
01:01:56,746 --> 01:02:00,978
There is a dangerous
predator on our streets,

1011
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:06,317
and he's prying-no, preying
on the fragile lives of our youth.

1012
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:08,482
We contacted the police.

1013
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:12,221
They said they couldn't
do anything about it.

1014
01:02:12,295 --> 01:02:15,458
We contacted the mayor and
she said she couldn't...

1015
01:02:15,531 --> 01:02:17,658
do anything about it.

1016
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:21,192
And we contacted Child
Protection Services.

1017
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:24,535
They said it wasn't
their problem.

1018
01:02:24,607 --> 01:02:27,508
So we took things
into our own hands.

1019
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:31,377
We are just a small group of
mothers and we are committed...

1020
01:02:31,447 --> 01:02:36,180
to bringing our message
directly to you,

1021
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:40,245
because the children
have got to be protected.

1022
01:02:46,195 --> 01:02:49,323
Ladies and Gentlemen, I do
not think I overstate...

1023
01:02:49,398 --> 01:02:54,392
<i>when I tell you: You are about</i>
<i>to see the new face of evil.</i>

1024
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:59,868
This man, Paul Johnson,
has been seen...

1025
01:02:59,942 --> 01:03:02,775
<i>in and around playgrounds</i>
<i>and schoolyards...</i>

1026
01:03:02,845 --> 01:03:06,838
trying to lure our children
away from us to commit...

1027
01:03:06,916 --> 01:03:08,315
<i>unspeakable acts.</i>

1028
01:03:08,384 --> 01:03:09,874
Oh Lord in Heaven.

1029
01:03:09,919 --> 01:03:14,856
If anyone has any information
that we could use as evidence...

1030
01:03:14,924 --> 01:03:18,758
to arrest and convict
this pedophile,

1031
01:03:18,828 --> 01:03:24,425
please contact
us at 555-KIDS.

1032
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:28,766
We know it's only a matter
of time before he succeeds...

1033
01:03:28,838 --> 01:03:32,899
in doing irreparable harm
to our children.

1034
01:03:33,442 --> 01:03:35,137
I knew he was a sicko.

1035
01:03:35,211 --> 01:03:39,545
Second, we are holding a
rally tomorrow at 10am...

1036
01:03:39,615 --> 01:03:45,178
at Wilshire Park, declaring the
playground a PEDOPHILE-FREE
ZONE.

1037
01:03:48,791 --> 01:03:52,056
From there, we will
officially mount our...

1038
01:03:52,128 --> 01:03:55,894
campaign to BRING HIM IN!

1039
01:03:59,635 --> 01:04:00,693
Bring him in.

1040
01:04:01,337 --> 01:04:02,929
Bring him in.

1041
01:04:03,472 --> 01:04:04,734
Bring him in.

1042
01:04:05,241 --> 01:04:06,708
Bring him in.

1043
01:04:06,776 --> 01:04:09,176
Thank you.
Thank you for your time.

1044
01:04:09,245 --> 01:04:11,440
<i>Thank you for coming.</i>
<i>It is so important.</i>

1045
01:04:11,514 --> 01:04:15,006
And we all look forward to seeing
all of you tomorrow with us.

1046
01:04:15,084 --> 01:04:16,142
Thank you.

1047
01:04:16,219 --> 01:04:17,083
Oh Paul, be there.

1048
01:04:17,153 --> 01:04:18,211
Be there.
Be there.

1049
01:04:19,288 --> 01:04:23,281
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>
<i>Just kidding. I'm not here.</i>

1050
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:27,227
Paul, it's Russell
honey, are you there?

1051
01:04:27,296 --> 01:04:29,764
<i>Look, I know we left</i>
<i>things kinda weird,</i>

1052
01:04:29,832 --> 01:04:31,424
<i>but I really need</i>
<i>to talk to you.</i>

1053
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:32,228
<i>Now.</i>

1054
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:34,927
<i>Shit.</i>

1055
01:04:35,004 --> 01:04:36,938
<i>Alright, call me the</i>
<i>second you get this, okay?</i>

1056
01:04:37,006 --> 01:04:39,099
<i>Because I really need to talk to you</i>
<i>about something important...</i>

1057
01:04:39,175 --> 01:04:40,574
<i>and I can't</i>
<i>leave it on a message.</i>

1058
01:04:40,643 --> 01:04:42,804
<i>So call me, okay?</i>
<i>Call me.</i>

1059
01:04:43,579 --> 01:04:45,308
Kelly Ann, I've gotta
go to the office.

1060
01:04:45,381 --> 01:04:47,474
There's something
I need to get.

1061
01:04:51,053 --> 01:04:52,145
Sarah, honey?
It's Russell.

1062
01:04:52,221 --> 01:04:54,485
Sweetheart, we
have a problem.

1063
01:05:41,804 --> 01:05:42,828
<i>Honey, I'm home.</i>

1064
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:46,239
<i>Sarah?</i>

1065
01:05:52,114 --> 01:05:52,978
Sarah?

1066
01:05:55,451 --> 01:05:56,577
Wake up, Phil.

1067
01:05:56,652 --> 01:05:59,519
Come on honey it's
a beautiful day...

1068
01:05:59,588 --> 01:06:01,522
and we have children to save.

1069
01:06:03,059 --> 01:06:04,185
It's raining.

1070
01:06:05,094 --> 01:06:06,061
Shut up, Phil.

1071
01:06:10,499 --> 01:06:14,401
<i>Dear Russell, I just</i>
<i>want to say I'm sorry.</i>

1072
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:16,904
<i>And we should probably</i>
<i>talk, when you're ready...</i>

1073
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:20,204
<i>I feel really bad for telling</i>
<i>you to "fuck off."</i>

1074
01:06:20,276 --> 01:06:22,210
<i>I'd love the chance</i>
<i>to make it up to you.</i>

1075
01:06:22,278 --> 01:06:24,246
<i>anything you want, you name it.</i>

1076
01:06:24,313 --> 01:06:26,907
<i>Of course, I don't have any</i>
<i>money, so make it cheap.</i>

1077
01:06:31,354 --> 01:06:34,414
<i>I also realized just how important</i>
<i>this babysitting thing is to me,</i>

1078
01:06:34,490 --> 01:06:36,390
<i>so I'm not giving up</i>
<i>on that yet.</i>

1079
01:06:36,459 --> 01:06:38,188
<i>I'm going to spend the</i>
<i>morning handing out flyers...</i>

1080
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:40,091
<i>at some of the</i>
<i>playgrounds around town.</i>

1081
01:06:43,265 --> 01:06:45,893
<i>Anyway, Love you, Paul.</i>

1082
01:06:45,968 --> 01:06:48,801
<i>P.S. Dinner, later?</i>

1083
01:07:39,255 --> 01:07:40,415
Oh, now you lock the door?

1084
01:07:40,489 --> 01:07:41,615
Paul?

1085
01:07:42,425 --> 01:07:43,722
Paul, are you in there?

1086
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:48,386
C'mon, honey,
answer the door.

1087
01:07:51,767 --> 01:07:52,461
Dammit.

1088
01:07:57,139 --> 01:07:59,607
Excuse me, is there something
going on in the park today?

1089
01:07:59,675 --> 01:08:01,540
Some sort of children's rally.

1090
01:08:01,610 --> 01:08:04,408
- Oh, thanks.
- Have a nice day!

1091
01:08:06,315 --> 01:08:08,909
<i>It's up to us to</i>
<i>protect our children.</i>

1092
01:08:11,954 --> 01:08:14,946
Now is not the
time to be passive,

1093
01:08:15,024 --> 01:08:19,256
to wait for the
invitable... the inevitable.

1094
01:08:19,328 --> 01:08:22,559
Now is not the time to
tell our children,

1095
01:08:22,631 --> 01:08:27,295
<i>"Sorry, sweetheart, we have to</i>
<i>wait until he hurts someone first."</i>

1096
01:08:28,604 --> 01:08:32,096
No, now is
the time for action.

1097
01:08:36,745 --> 01:08:39,578
There are several
things you can do.

1098
01:08:39,648 --> 01:08:43,277
<i>Go home, alert your</i>
<i>neighbors, tell your friends.</i>

1099
01:08:43,352 --> 01:08:48,221
Make everyone you see aware
of the danger that is in our midst.

1100
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:51,453
<i>Second, call the</i>
<i>mayor's office.</i>

1101
01:08:51,527 --> 01:08:52,994
<i>Don't be afraid.</i>

1102
01:08:53,062 --> 01:08:54,393
<i>Tell them how you feel.</i>

1103
01:08:54,463 --> 01:08:56,431
<i>Call your local</i>
<i>police precinct.</i>

1104
01:08:56,499 --> 01:08:59,798
<i>Put pressure on the law</i>
<i>enforcement of this community...</i>

1105
01:08:59,869 --> 01:09:03,771
to bring this offender
in before it's too late!

1106
01:09:03,839 --> 01:09:05,500
We must bring him in.

1107
01:09:06,108 --> 01:09:06,904
Bring him in.

1108
01:09:07,343 --> 01:09:08,310
Bring him in.

1109
01:09:08,677 --> 01:09:09,666
Bring him in.

1110
01:09:10,045 --> 01:09:11,137
Bring him in.

1111
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:12,374
Bring him in.

1112
01:09:12,448 --> 01:09:13,312
Thank you.

1113
01:09:13,382 --> 01:09:16,749
I want to tell you, there is
some good news: last night,

1114
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:20,220
after my press conference, I
received several phone calls,

1115
01:09:20,289 --> 01:09:23,725
one from a gentleman
named-David Berman-who knows...

1116
01:09:23,792 --> 01:09:27,888
this predator personally,
and who has incontrovertible...

1117
01:09:27,963 --> 01:09:31,364
proof that he is
a child molester.

1118
01:09:32,201 --> 01:09:33,668
And we will hear from
him in a minute.

1119
01:09:35,738 --> 01:09:39,435
<i>Again, it is up to us</i>
<i>to protect our children.</i>

1120
01:09:43,245 --> 01:09:44,735
What's your name?

1121
01:09:44,813 --> 01:09:46,838
Can you
say "Charlie"?

1122
01:09:46,916 --> 01:09:48,577
He's so cute I could
just take him home with me.

1123
01:09:48,651 --> 01:09:49,913
Thank you.

1124
01:09:49,985 --> 01:09:52,715
Well, listen, my name's Paul.

1125
01:09:52,788 --> 01:09:55,814
If you ever need a
babysitter, give me a call.

1126
01:09:57,259 --> 01:09:58,089
It's him!

1127
01:09:58,694 --> 01:09:59,524
It's him!

1128
01:09:59,595 --> 01:10:00,789
What, what is it?

1129
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:02,023
It's him!
It's Paul!

1130
01:10:02,731 --> 01:10:03,561
<i>It's Paul!</i>

1131
01:10:03,632 --> 01:10:04,690
<i>Bring him in!</i>

1132
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:06,158
<i>Bring him in!</i>

1133
01:10:22,017 --> 01:10:23,075
Well go!
Get him!

1134
01:10:23,152 --> 01:10:23,914
Somebody get him!

1135
01:10:23,986 --> 01:10:24,748
It is him!

1136
01:10:24,820 --> 01:10:25,787
Get him.

1137
01:10:25,854 --> 01:10:26,718
Get him.

1138
01:10:26,789 --> 01:10:28,620
I'll watch the
kids, just stop him!

1139
01:10:28,691 --> 01:10:29,555
Come on.

1140
01:10:29,625 --> 01:10:30,091
I'm right behind you.

1141
01:11:39,428 --> 01:11:40,588
Check there.

1142
01:11:40,663 --> 01:11:42,255
I'll do it.
I'll do it.

1143
01:11:44,133 --> 01:11:45,566
<i>Did you see a guy come</i>
<i>in there just now?</i>

1144
01:11:49,872 --> 01:11:53,000
<i>- No, you sure?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

1145
01:11:53,075 --> 01:11:55,168
OK.

1146
01:11:55,244 --> 01:11:56,677
OK.

1147
01:11:56,745 --> 01:11:57,712
<i>Good job, people.</i>

1148
01:11:57,780 --> 01:11:59,748
<i>Alright, we're going</i>
<i>back... back to the park.</i>

1149
01:11:59,815 --> 01:12:01,282
<i>OK, here we go.</i>

1150
01:12:15,898 --> 01:12:16,762
Russell!

1151
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:18,667
<i>Russell!</i>

1152
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:39,582
Can't believe he got away.

1153
01:12:40,422 --> 01:12:41,912
Yeah.

1154
01:12:41,990 --> 01:12:44,015
Sneaky son of a bitch.

1155
01:12:44,093 --> 01:12:46,084
Can't believe it.

1156
01:12:46,161 --> 01:12:47,856
Name's Richard Long.

1157
01:12:47,930 --> 01:12:50,228
Russell Trotter.

1158
01:12:50,299 --> 01:12:51,766
Friends call me Dick.

1159
01:12:51,834 --> 01:12:53,062
Nice to meetcha.

1160
01:12:53,135 --> 01:12:54,534
You, too.

1161
01:12:54,603 --> 01:12:55,865
So I hear this guy's
been convicted of...

1162
01:12:55,938 --> 01:12:59,396
child molestation in
six different states.

1163
01:13:00,709 --> 01:13:01,676
Really?

1164
01:13:01,744 --> 01:13:02,904
I hadn't heard that.

1165
01:13:02,978 --> 01:13:05,105
I bet they find bodies
in his basement.

1166
01:13:05,180 --> 01:13:06,545
You think?

1167
01:13:06,615 --> 01:13:09,083
He's a Class-A
monster, you know?

1168
01:13:09,151 --> 01:13:10,311
Wow.

1169
01:13:10,386 --> 01:13:11,648
Yeah, it's awful.

1170
01:13:12,788 --> 01:13:14,688
Don't worry, we'll get him.

1171
01:13:14,757 --> 01:13:17,157
He may have gotten
away from us this time,

1172
01:13:17,226 --> 01:13:20,593
but he's nearby,
I can feel it.

1173
01:13:22,564 --> 01:13:23,656
Don't worry, buddy.

1174
01:13:23,732 --> 01:13:25,256
We'll get the sick
son-of-a-bitch.

1175
01:13:36,712 --> 01:13:38,509
- Hey.
- Hey.

1176
01:13:39,882 --> 01:13:41,247
Russell.

1177
01:13:41,316 --> 01:13:46,083
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, you know.

1178
01:13:46,155 --> 01:13:48,214
Say, wanna get out of here?

1179
01:13:48,290 --> 01:13:49,951
Sure, let's do that.

1180
01:13:52,694 --> 01:13:55,060
<i>What started out as a rally</i>
<i>took a strange turn moments ago...</i>

1181
01:13:55,130 --> 01:13:57,530
<i>when Paul Johnson,</i>
<i>alleged child molester,</i>

1182
01:13:57,599 --> 01:13:59,260
<i>wandered into the park.</i>

1183
01:13:59,334 --> 01:14:02,030
<i>The crowd went wild, chasing</i>
<i>Johnson down the street,</i>

1184
01:14:02,104 --> 01:14:04,504
<i>hoping to bring him to justice.</i>

1185
01:14:04,573 --> 01:14:06,336
What are you doing here Paul?

1186
01:14:06,408 --> 01:14:07,636
What is going on?

1187
01:14:07,709 --> 01:14:08,869
You're all over the news.

1188
01:14:08,944 --> 01:14:09,774
I don't know.

1189
01:14:09,845 --> 01:14:11,642
Honey, it's gonna be
alright. Hi, I'm Russell.

1190
01:14:11,713 --> 01:14:13,613
- Elise.
- Nice to meet you.

1191
01:14:13,682 --> 01:14:16,207
- Oh my God.
- Is it true?

1192
01:14:16,285 --> 01:14:18,082
No!
It's not true.

1193
01:14:18,153 --> 01:14:20,678
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I know it's not true.

1194
01:14:20,756 --> 01:14:21,745
It's just, Paul...

1195
01:14:21,824 --> 01:14:24,088
Hello? Hello?

1196
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:26,050
Hey where are you?

1197
01:14:27,162 --> 01:14:29,630
My place?
My place, seriously?

1198
01:14:31,166 --> 01:14:32,895
Ok, I'll be there
as soon as I can.

1199
01:14:32,968 --> 01:14:34,196
Whew.

1200
01:14:34,269 --> 01:14:35,065
Okay.

1201
01:14:35,871 --> 01:14:38,203
Look, we just need to stay
calm and figure out...

1202
01:14:38,273 --> 01:14:39,331
what we're gonna do.

1203
01:14:41,043 --> 01:14:42,567
Why is this happening?

1204
01:14:42,644 --> 01:14:44,111
What did I do?

1205
01:14:44,179 --> 01:14:45,908
I mean, I was just...

1206
01:14:45,981 --> 01:14:47,744
hanging out at
playgrounds, and...

1207
01:14:47,816 --> 01:14:51,616
trying to get close
to some kids and...

1208
01:14:57,893 --> 01:15:00,191
<i>I could just eat you up,</i>
<i>yes I could.</i>

1209
01:15:08,770 --> 01:15:10,533
Oh my God.

1210
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:35,828
<i>He hasn't moved or said</i>
<i>a thing in ten minutes.</i>

1211
01:15:35,898 --> 01:15:37,889
<i>Paul honey.</i>
<i>What's going on?</i>

1212
01:15:37,966 --> 01:15:39,263
<i>He was being chased</i>
<i>by a lynch mob...</i>

1213
01:15:39,334 --> 01:15:40,323
<i>that's what was going on.</i>

1214
01:15:40,402 --> 01:15:41,232
<i>Are you serious?</i>

1215
01:15:41,303 --> 01:15:42,600
<i>As a tombstone.</i>

1216
01:15:42,671 --> 01:15:44,104
<i>Sorry.</i>

1217
01:15:44,172 --> 01:15:46,163
<i>Okay, okay.</i>

1218
01:15:46,241 --> 01:15:48,539
Here's what we're
going to do.

1219
01:15:48,610 --> 01:15:50,976
We're just going to face
this thing together.

1220
01:15:51,046 --> 01:15:52,843
We have no other choice.

1221
01:15:52,915 --> 01:15:54,780
<i>Paul, are you listening?</i>

1222
01:15:54,850 --> 01:15:57,011
<i>Everybody here</i>
<i>that loves you,</i>

1223
01:15:57,085 --> 01:16:00,020
<i>me and Russell I'm sorry I</i>
<i>don't remember your name...</i>

1224
01:16:00,088 --> 01:16:01,680
- Elise.
- And Elise.

1225
01:16:01,757 --> 01:16:02,553
And your parents.

1226
01:16:02,624 --> 01:16:04,057
We will call your parents
because that will help.

1227
01:16:04,126 --> 01:16:07,789
<i>And we are all just going to</i>
<i>go and face this together.</i>

1228
01:16:07,863 --> 01:16:09,262
<i>Whoa.</i>

1229
01:16:09,331 --> 01:16:11,629
Where I come from we don't
mess with a lynch mob.

1230
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:13,600
Well, what else
do you want to do?

1231
01:16:13,669 --> 01:16:15,660
It might just work.
I mean, think about it.

1232
01:16:15,737 --> 01:16:17,227
All of us and Paul's parents.

1233
01:16:17,306 --> 01:16:19,399
I mean, they've at least
got to listen to us, right?

1234
01:16:19,474 --> 01:16:22,500
Paul, we need the phone
number of your parents now.

1235
01:16:24,046 --> 01:16:25,877
Well, that's going
to be tricky.

1236
01:16:27,649 --> 01:16:29,014
My parents are dead.

1237
01:16:32,020 --> 01:16:33,146
What?

1238
01:16:33,221 --> 01:16:39,387
When I was six... they owned
the donut shop downtown.

1239
01:16:41,363 --> 01:16:49,134
And Dad was trying to fix the
fryer thing with all the grease.

1240
01:16:49,204 --> 01:16:53,265
<i>I guess I was bugging him or</i>
<i>something cause he sent me...</i>

1241
01:16:53,342 --> 01:16:57,836
<i>outside to play and, uh, well,</i>
<i>the next thing you know,</i>

1242
01:16:57,913 --> 01:17:01,747
<i>they're burnt up like curly fries.</i>

1243
01:17:14,396 --> 01:17:16,887
So you have been accused
of being a pedophile...

1244
01:17:16,965 --> 01:17:19,058
<i>and this is the moment</i>
<i>you choose to tell us...</i>

1245
01:17:19,134 --> 01:17:23,298
<i>you've been lying to us the</i>
<i>entire time that we've known you?</i>

1246
01:17:23,372 --> 01:17:26,637
Paul, your timing
really bad.

1247
01:17:26,708 --> 01:17:28,471
Listen to me.

1248
01:17:28,543 --> 01:17:30,773
Listen to me!

1249
01:17:30,846 --> 01:17:34,782
I did not do any
of those things.

1250
01:17:36,385 --> 01:17:40,116
I'm sorry that I made up
stories about my dead parents...

1251
01:17:40,188 --> 01:17:43,316
but I would never hurt...

1252
01:17:52,701 --> 01:17:53,895
I know you wouldn't.
I know you wouldn't.

1253
01:17:53,969 --> 01:17:55,197
I know you wouldn't.
I know you wouldn't.

1254
01:17:59,775 --> 01:18:01,572
This is really weird Paul.

1255
01:18:03,712 --> 01:18:04,872
You're a mess.

1256
01:18:06,648 --> 01:18:10,482
I may be a mess, but
I am not a pedophile.

1257
01:18:14,756 --> 01:18:16,280
We will not give up.

1258
01:18:16,358 --> 01:18:19,384
For these are our children
that we are fighting for.

1259
01:18:21,663 --> 01:18:25,622
<i>Now I have every of faith</i>
<i>that we will find this Paul Johnson.</i>

1260
01:18:25,701 --> 01:18:26,292
<i>All right?</i>

1261
01:18:26,368 --> 01:18:29,633
And when we do
we will bring him in!

1262
01:18:30,672 --> 01:18:31,900
Bring him in.

1263
01:18:32,374 --> 01:18:33,534
Bring him in.

1264
01:18:34,476 --> 01:18:35,568
He can't have gotten far.

1265
01:18:35,644 --> 01:18:37,168
And we are not
going to stop...

1266
01:18:39,014 --> 01:18:40,481
Do you have something
you'd like to add, sir?

1267
01:18:47,355 --> 01:18:47,980
It's him.

1268
01:18:48,056 --> 01:18:48,954
<i>It's the guy!</i>

1269
01:18:49,024 --> 01:18:50,184
We need security.

1270
01:18:50,258 --> 01:18:52,123
I need a police officer.

1271
01:18:52,194 --> 01:18:55,095
OK, everyone just,
just stay calm...

1272
01:18:55,163 --> 01:18:56,630
I have something to say.

1273
01:18:56,698 --> 01:18:59,189
We don't want to hear anything
you have to say, pervert!

1274
01:18:59,267 --> 01:19:01,235
You know, I think you do.

1275
01:19:01,303 --> 01:19:02,930
We don't need to
hear your lies!

1276
01:19:03,004 --> 01:19:04,062
Bring him in.

1277
01:19:04,139 --> 01:19:05,401
Bring him in.

1278
01:19:05,474 --> 01:19:06,031
Bring him in.

1279
01:19:06,108 --> 01:19:06,767
Sock Paul!

1280
01:19:06,842 --> 01:19:08,309
Sock Paul!

1281
01:19:08,376 --> 01:19:10,435
<i>Quiet.</i>
Just be quiet.

1282
01:19:11,780 --> 01:19:13,270
Just listen to the man.

1283
01:19:13,348 --> 01:19:14,679
<i>He didn't do anything.</i>

1284
01:19:15,350 --> 01:19:17,841
This whole thing...
it's ridiculous.

1285
01:19:18,220 --> 01:19:19,847
- Do you have children?
- What?

1286
01:19:19,921 --> 01:19:21,752
- Do you have any kids!
- No.

1287
01:19:21,823 --> 01:19:23,620
<i>Well then shut your mouth,</i>
<i>all right?</i>

1288
01:19:23,692 --> 01:19:25,125
You have nothing to say here.

1289
01:19:29,197 --> 01:19:32,132
So please, just give me
a minute to explain.

1290
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:34,464
Give it up, Johnson,
you're sick!

1291
01:19:34,536 --> 01:19:36,970
No, I'm not.
I'm not sick.

1292
01:19:38,073 --> 01:19:40,439
I know I made some mistakes,
but nothing like...

1293
01:19:40,509 --> 01:19:42,568
what you people think.

1294
01:19:42,644 --> 01:19:45,943
<i>I was just marching with</i>
<i>you, a few minutes ago...</i>

1295
01:19:46,014 --> 01:19:49,313
And I heard some awful
things being said about me.

1296
01:19:49,384 --> 01:19:50,749
And none of those
things is true.

1297
01:19:50,819 --> 01:19:52,480
Like we're supposed
to trust you?

1298
01:19:52,554 --> 01:19:53,919
I did mess up.

1299
01:19:53,989 --> 01:19:56,048
I did go to the playground but...

1300
01:19:56,124 --> 01:19:59,025
<i>only because I wanted</i>
<i>to play with some kids.</i>

1301
01:19:59,094 --> 01:20:03,724
I only wanted to start
babysitting because I love kids.

1302
01:20:03,799 --> 01:20:06,962
It sounds like excuses to me,
made-up excuses.

1303
01:20:07,035 --> 01:20:08,332
Yeah, why should
we believe you?

1304
01:20:09,771 --> 01:20:10,430
I don't know.

1305
01:20:12,274 --> 01:20:15,675
All I know is I came to the
park this morning to hand out...

1306
01:20:15,744 --> 01:20:18,406
some babysitting flyers
and then...

1307
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:21,347
And then you ran.
All right?

1308
01:20:21,416 --> 01:20:23,782
If you have nothing to hide,
why would you run?

1309
01:20:23,852 --> 01:20:26,047
Yeah, I ran.

1310
01:20:26,121 --> 01:20:29,613
I looked up and there were
all these posters, and signs,

1311
01:20:29,691 --> 01:20:32,956
and that woman has
a sock on her arm...

1312
01:20:33,028 --> 01:20:35,519
<i>I didn't know what to think.</i>

1313
01:20:38,700 --> 01:20:40,565
But I came back.

1314
01:20:40,635 --> 01:20:43,502
I wouldn't have come back,
I couldn't have come back...

1315
01:20:43,572 --> 01:20:45,870
if I had done
any of those terrible things.

1316
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:50,603
Look, if anyone, anyone,
has any proof that I...

1317
01:20:50,679 --> 01:20:54,308
did any of that awful stuff,
come up here right now.

1318
01:20:56,985 --> 01:20:58,009
You want proof?

1319
01:20:58,620 --> 01:20:59,780
How do you explain this?

1320
01:20:59,855 --> 01:21:01,880
Yeah.
How do you explain this?

1321
01:21:01,957 --> 01:21:03,083
That, that's my godson...

1322
01:21:03,158 --> 01:21:06,321
This man is a menace to
society and must be stopped!

1323
01:21:07,295 --> 01:21:07,989
Oh yes.

1324
01:21:09,531 --> 01:21:10,293
Give me that.

1325
01:21:11,666 --> 01:21:13,861
I gave Paul this photograph.

1326
01:21:13,935 --> 01:21:15,800
Who are you?

1327
01:21:15,871 --> 01:21:18,271
Paul is my son's Godfather.

1328
01:21:18,340 --> 01:21:20,001
<i>He's a little odd, yes.</i>

1329
01:21:20,075 --> 01:21:23,010
<i>But he'd lay down</i>
<i>his life for my son.</i>

1330
01:21:23,078 --> 01:21:26,673
That's exactly the kind of
thing a pedophile would do!

1331
01:21:26,748 --> 01:21:28,875
You can't just
breeze in here lady,

1332
01:21:28,950 --> 01:21:31,077
and tell us
everything's fine.

1333
01:21:31,152 --> 01:21:32,619
Paul Johnson is
a lot of things,

1334
01:21:32,687 --> 01:21:35,087
but one thing he isn't
is a child molester.

1335
01:21:37,926 --> 01:21:39,154
Aren't you gay?

1336
01:21:41,329 --> 01:21:42,318
Well, yeah.

1337
01:21:42,397 --> 01:21:44,524
What does that have
to do with anything?!

1338
01:21:44,599 --> 01:21:45,861
Well, because...

1339
01:21:45,934 --> 01:21:47,834
he fits the profile!

1340
01:21:50,672 --> 01:21:51,900
What about the toy store?

1341
01:21:53,775 --> 01:21:55,106
What?

1342
01:21:55,176 --> 01:21:59,510
I saw you take a little
girl to the bathroom.

1343
01:21:59,581 --> 01:22:02,482
Because she had to pee!

1344
01:22:03,718 --> 01:22:07,245
Look, I know I screwed up.
OK?

1345
01:22:07,322 --> 01:22:12,157
I guess I wasn't thinking
like a... a grownup.

1346
01:22:12,227 --> 01:22:13,524
I just...

1347
01:22:14,863 --> 01:22:16,592
You just what?

1348
01:22:16,665 --> 01:22:18,656
I just a...

1349
01:22:22,570 --> 01:22:29,408
We all have a way
of looking at the world, you know?

1350
01:22:29,477 --> 01:22:33,004
And mine is a lot more
like your kids than yours.

1351
01:22:34,215 --> 01:22:38,515
<i>Where you see a chair and</i>
<i>a sheet, we see a fort.</i>

1352
01:22:38,586 --> 01:22:42,852
Where you see a yard full of
leaves waiting to be raked,

1353
01:22:42,924 --> 01:22:47,623
we see confetti and thousands
of chances for crunching.

1354
01:22:51,166 --> 01:22:54,033
Look, I never meant
to hurt anyone,

1355
01:22:54,102 --> 01:22:56,627
least of all...
one of your kids.

1356
01:22:59,207 --> 01:23:01,334
<i>But I honestly don't think I did.</i>

1357
01:23:08,283 --> 01:23:09,113
Ask 'em.

1358
01:23:10,952 --> 01:23:11,850
Ask 'em.

1359
01:23:12,454 --> 01:23:14,752
They know.
They'll tell you.

1360
01:23:14,823 --> 01:23:19,123
Ask them if they're mad at me
or afraid of me,

1361
01:23:19,194 --> 01:23:23,927
or if I have done anything
at all that made them feel bad.

1362
01:23:27,369 --> 01:23:30,202
Joey, did Paul
ever do anything to...

1363
01:23:34,709 --> 01:23:38,509
I know I went about
this all wrong,

1364
01:23:38,580 --> 01:23:40,844
but I promise it wasn't
what you thought.

1365
01:23:43,785 --> 01:23:45,980
I just wanted to
have a family again.

1366
01:23:54,896 --> 01:23:56,056
<i>Hey, Paul.</i>

1367
01:23:57,232 --> 01:23:58,995
Joey here says
he's mad at you.

1368
01:24:00,835 --> 01:24:03,804
Yeah, he says you stopped
coming to the playground.

1369
01:24:29,898 --> 01:24:31,229
Hi, Monkey.

1370
01:24:33,501 --> 01:24:35,025
How's my buddy, huh?

1371
01:24:35,904 --> 01:24:37,098
<i>How's my buddy?</i>

1372
01:24:42,577 --> 01:24:44,374
But he fit the profile...

1373
01:24:44,446 --> 01:24:46,038
I know.

1374
01:24:46,114 --> 01:24:49,379
Come on, let's just go home.

1375
01:25:44,973 --> 01:25:46,736
All right.
You guys have a safe flight.

1376
01:26:08,730 --> 01:26:10,459
I love you, you little monkey.

1377
01:26:13,268 --> 01:26:14,257
Come here.

1378
01:26:20,942 --> 01:26:22,273
All right baby.

1379
01:26:22,343 --> 01:26:25,335
Back on an airplane.

1380
01:26:25,413 --> 01:26:28,541
- I love you.
- I love you.

1381
01:26:28,616 --> 01:26:29,674
Say hi to Jim for me.

1382
01:26:29,751 --> 01:26:30,740
OK. I will.

1383
01:26:43,164 --> 01:26:44,222
It's gonna be all right.

1384
01:26:47,468 --> 01:26:48,958
What's gonna be all right?

1385
01:26:50,972 --> 01:26:51,961
Kidding!

1386
01:26:54,442 --> 01:26:55,773
I know.
