It's an invitation to listen,
even more so...
than if I wasn't...
Hey.
Somebody's gonna
get a whuppin'.
Shut up.
- Has Berman been over here?
- No.
You're still gonna
get a whuppin'.
Not if he didn't see me.
He saw you, Paul.
I saw him see you.
Just because you don't
want a thing to be true,
doesn't mean it's not.
Could you stop
bothering me Paul?
I've got calls to make,
magazines to sell.
- So how was lunch?
- Uh, good, good.
Yeah, I bet.
I'd like a two-hour
lunch myself.
Yeah, sorry.
I lost track of time.
Really?
What a surprise.
You can make it up at
the end of the day.
OK.
Don't do the crime if
you haven't got the time.
Now don't you have
quotas to meet?
Dink.
Johnson, I forgot something.
I've got changes
to the script.
After the first refusal...
Jesus Christ, Johnson.
You gotta be kidding me.
What world do you live
in that this is OK?
You take a freaking
two-hour lunch...
and now you're
painting at your desk?
God Almighty.
You creative types drive me
crazy, you think just because...
you're an artist or something
that you don't have to...
act like normal people-
Let me tell you something.
There's something
called responsibility...
and it's a two-handed shovel...
and I can't chop down
the tree by myself.
You understand.
Hey, hey, are you
even listening to me?
Uh, sorry.
I don't want to hear it.
You don't think, Johnson.
Look, just go home.
- I don't need to...
- Just go home.
- I...
- There is no "I"...
in "Walker Telemarketing,"
Johnson.
- Actually...
- Shut up.
Just go home, and come back
tomorrow when you're ready to work.
Got it.
Ready to work.
It's finished.
Oh!
- You're early.
- Yeah.
- What happened?
- What's for dinner?
Hey, no.
What's that?
It's Morgan.
Paul, that's beautiful.
- Yeah.
Where is he?
He's in his room playing.
By himself?
What kind of mother are you?
What happened at work today?
Hey, little monkey.
Whatcha doin'?
Are you my little monkey?
Look what I made you.
Yeah, it's a painting.
- Painting.
- Yeah.
For Morgan.
Morgan.
Morgan, the monkey.
Jump, jump, jump.
Jump, jump, jump.
Jump, jump, jump.
Quit jumping on
the bed, you two!
You're early.
What is going on?
Where's my boy?
He's in the bedroom,
playing with his Godfather.
Hey, Morgan.
Hey, Uncle Paul.
Hey, Jim.
Can you say "Hi, Daddy."
Wow, the whole family's home early.
What do you say we
get out of here?
OK.
You haven't told
him yet, have you?
I just don't know
what he's going to do.
- I'm not telling him.
- I'll tell him.
Just be gentle, okay?
He's not a plum, Sarah.
I'm not gonna bruise him.
OK.
I'll tell him.
You tell him.
Tell me what?
Well, um... we've got
some good news.
Yeah?
I, um, I got a new job.
Oh yeah?
Congratulations.
Thanks.
I'm really excited.
But the not so good
news is it's... in Japan.
And we're leaving next week.
I wanted to tell you sooner,
but it was just so crazy...
and I didn't want
you to freak out.
It's...
And the littlest
monkey left his tribe...
and set out to find
his place in the world.
First he came to a tree filled
with beautiful cockatiels.
"Henry, Henry," he called,
"Is any of you my friend Henry?"
With shoes on.
Yeah, the monkey
had shoes on.
"Quiet," says the cockatiels,
"We're sleeping."
"Is any of you my friend Henry?"
the littlest
monkey asked again.
"No, there's no Henry here,"
said the cockatiels,
not very nicely.
"Now leave us alone."
And suddenly the cockatiels
weren't very beautiful any more.
The littlest monkey
kept walking.
Are you tired little buddy?
You need to go night-night?
Come here, come here you.
Are you ready for bed?
Are you ready
for bed, mister?
Okay, come on.
OK, well uh...
Morgan's asleep so...
I'm going to head home.
Okay.
You OK?
Yeah.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
Night sweetie.
OK.
- Thank you.
- Uh-huh.
OK...
I'm gonna head home.
Wait, no, don't go.
Well uh, I'm tired.
Just wait one second.
I have something for you.
Sit.
- What's this?
- Just open it.
- What is it?
- Open it.
That is hilarious.
I thought you'd like it.
He looks like one of
the Village People.
There's a picture of me,
just like this...
except I'm a construction worker.
Nice.
I can't wait to
show this to my mom,
she loves the Village People.
She does?
That's weird.
Yeah, well, she's
a weird lady.
Anyway, thanks for this.
For his Uncle Paul.
- I'm not really his uncle.
- You might as well be.
Yeah, I guess.
Listen, I want to apologize
for not telling you sooner.
I just didn't know
how you were gonna...
Look, I know it's going
really fast but we're leaving...
Saturday morning at 10 am.
OK?
OK.
- Well, bye.
- Bye.
Bye, Jim.
Bye, Morgan.
Come here, come here.
I got a hankering
for biscuits, gravy...
and a big old bowl of
collard greens so... Taco Bell?
OK.
Hello?
Hello?
I'm just kidding.
I'm not here.
Paul?
Honey?
I'm sure I don't
need to do this,
but I wanted to remind you
that today's the day we're...
God, it's even
hard to say.
Well, I'll see you
when you get here.
That's everything.
Where the hell is he?
Hey... it's time to leave.
Uh, can I help you?
Oh. Hi.
I'm Paul... Morgan's godfather.
OK.
Are you babysitting?
Oh, is he asleep?
Sorry.
What's your name?
Elise.
Who are you?
Wow, Elise... got a boy over
while you're babysitting.
We're not babysitting.
Am I not supposed
to say that anymore?
What, they don't like
being called babies?
Whatever.
Look, I don't want
to wake him up,
so just tell Morgan that his
Uncle Paul stopped by...
and that I love him.
OK. Bye.
Bye.
Hey!
Hey, what are you doing?
Uh, nothing.
Look, you're gonna
have to leave. OK?
Ok, um...
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.
Um, look, I made
this for Morgan...
It's OK, you don't have
to give me anything.
No, I didn't want to
scare you. Please...
I want you to have it.
It's beautiful.
Thanks.
I'm sorry... um,
what's your name?
Paul.
Elise.
It's nice to meet you.
You, too.
Look, Paul, um...
I don't know what the Fabers
told you or... or didn't tell you.
Um...
They moved.
To Japan.
I'm so sorry if
you didn't know.
Sorry.
You were smushing my boob.
Paul?
Honey?
I'm sure I don't
need to do this,
but I wanted to remind you
that today's the day that we're...
God, it's even
hard to say...
well, I'll just see you when
you get here.
Hey, honey, I'm sorry we
didn't get to say goodbye.
I guess you got
the time confused,
or maybe I didn't tell you
the right time, I don't know.
We're at the airport
now... off to Japan.
Can you believe it?
I already miss you so much.
I'll call you soon to
see how you're doing.
Morgan, want to say
bye to Uncle Paul?
- Bye-bye.
- OK.
Bye, sweetie.
We all love you.
- OK.
- Where's Johnson?
I am not my
brother's keeper.
And you can tell your friend,
if he's not part of the solution,
he's part of the problem,
and you've got to cut loose
all the dead branches, right?
OK.
- What does that mean, exactly?
- It means he's fired.
Tell him to come in
and get his stuff.
Actually, tell
him not to bother,
I'm going to keep all
those paints for my kids.
Trash.
Trash.
For the kids.
Jesus Christ.
Walker Telemarketing.
May I help you?
Russell?
Hey, it's Sarah...
Faber.
Oh, hey, hey.
How are ya?
Good, good.
Listen, I'm a little
concerned about Paul.
You and me both.
I haven't seen him for days.
You're kidding.
No. I thought he was
with you guys.
No. No.
Did he not tell you
we moved to Japan?
What?
We moved.
Last week.
You're kidding, right?
No, I'm not.
He didn't say anything?
Oh my God.
Yeah.
So Japan, huh?
You do know all the people
there are Japanese, right?
Yeah, I feel so tall suddenly.
Listen, if you hear anything
at all will you let me know?
My phone number is
011-81-655426.
So then just, sayonara.
OK, bye.
Sayonara.
First of all, you need to
lock your door...
because this is a
terrible neighborhood.
I'm sorry, Paul.
This sucks.
Yes, it totally sucks.
But you will get
through this.
I know that Morgan was a
huge part of your life,
but he wasn't your life.
And you will see him again.
Sometimes.
And you've got your
painting, you've got me,
you've got your parents.
Well, I've got you.
My parents aren't that
much help, really.
That's right, you've got me.
And it's just gonna
take some time.
But you can't lay
around here waiting on it.
You gotta get back
in the world. OK?
C'mon, let's go do something.
What do you want to do?
Well, go on.
Nah.
Go on.
- I don't wanna.
- Yes, you do.
I'm too embarrassed.
You're too embarrassed?
- I'm very shy.
- You are not.
Now go on.
Get out there and play.
The kids are gonna
think I'm weird.
You are weird Paul.
Now go on.
Want a push?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
- You wanna go high?
- Yeah.
Yeah?
Whatcha doin'?
Nufin'.
Nothin'?
Not even one tiny
little thing?
Not even breathing?
Nope.
Oh my goodness.
Somebody better get
this guy an ambulance.
He's not breathing.
Hey somebody...
Be-naah.
Be-naah.
You're not breathing either?
Tyler, honey,
go on.
If you want a
ride just ask him.
All right?
Say please.
Do you a...
do you want a ride?
Come on.
OK.
Thank you.
Hold on, 'cause
we're going fast!
It's so nice to see a man
here, for a change.
I just love when dads get
involved with their kids.
No kidding.
Did you hear about
the Archer's au pair?
- No.
- The agency sent a guy.
From France. OK?
Apparently his
name was Camille...
so they didn't know
until he showed up.
Oh my God!
What did they do?
Well, they sent him back.
Thank God.
Who's wants to leave their children
with some strange Frenchman?
You want a fish?
Hey.
Look, I'm really sorry
about last week, but I,
uh, I need my job back.
I promise it won't
happen again.
No, it won't.
The not showing up thing
definitely won't happen again.
No, it won't.
Because you don't
work here anymore.
Oh, come on, Berman.
- David.
- David, sorry.
- Give me another chance.
- Look, Paul...
If you don't tow the line,
the other bird gets the worm.
Ok, um, well, what if
I make it up to you.
It's too late, Johnson.
You blew it.
Besides, I don't need
any freaks on the team.
How'd it go?
No luck.
Yeah, I figured that.
Yeah.
The job sucks anyway.
Easy to say when
you have one.
True.
Although I'm still hoping that
Oprah picks me for her book club.
Hey.
It probably means I need
to finish the book first.
Probably so.
Ah, it's OK.
I'll probably find a job
that lets me paint more anyway.
Definitely.
Maybe you could find something...
you really want to do.
Like what?
I don't know. What
do you really like to do?
Besides painting, I mean.
I don't know.
Get him!
Get him!
I mean, there's
gotta be something.
Like what?
Well, hello there precious.
Look at you.
Look at you.
You're so cute,
I could just eat you up.
I could just eat you up.
Yes I could.
What's your name?
Andrea.
A beautiful name for
a beautiful baby.
Well, you have a
great day, Andrea.
Ok?
You have a great day.
Yes you should.
You should have a good day,
that's what you should do.
Okay.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Can I help you?
- Yeah.
I was wondering if you had an
application I could fill out?
- Excuse me?
- A job application?
Uh, yes, I guess.
OK, thanks.
I'll just fill this out
and get it back to you.
You do that.
He's so good with them.
I know it.
Thank God he's here.
If I had to push that
merry-go-round one more time,
I'm going to vomit.
It's like he
never gets tired.
I know.
How he does he do it?
I mean, he must be
like a stay-at-home dad.
Playground superman.
I wish Phil had the
time to be like that.
Which one is his?
Hmm...
You know, I don't know.
No?
Oh.
Is it that little
blond boy there?
No, that's
Michael... he's Janie's.
Oh.
And that's Ruth's.
- Yeah.
- She's Kelly's.
Huh.
I hope he didn't lose him.
Me, too.
Well, I've got to go.
Lindsay's got a
doctor's appointment.
Oh.
She's got some bumps
on her whatsis.
Oh.
See you on Wednesday, Mag?
OK.
Paul?
Sorry.
Hi, I'm Maggie Butler.
Hi.
Paul Johnson.
I'm Tyler's mother.
You know, the little...
Of course, of course.
He's such a sweet
little boy.
Thank you.
So which one's your son?
I don't have a son.
Oh.
Your daughter?
Is she the..?
No.
I'm gay.
I don't have any kids.
Oh.
That's fine.
So who do you
bring to the park?
Your niece, or
nephew, or neighbor?
I haven't been
bringing anyone.
I see.
Well, the kids are
waiting for me, so...
Tyler!
Tyler, honey,
come here.
Dang it.
Tyler!
At the same time.
All of them?
Yeah. It was like something
out of The Twilight Zone.
Huh.
What?
Well, honey, it hadn't
really occurred to me,
but you might
wanna rethink the whole...
hanging-around-the-playground
thing.
It's a little Lolita,
don't you think?
What's that supposed to mean?
Nothin'.
It's just-people might
get the wrong idea.
What idea?
Look, I didn't come here
to talk about this, anyway.
I want you to help me do up
a, um, you know, a resume.
Alright, I can do that.
What's in it for me?
What do you want?
Don't ask.
Undying love?
That'll do.
So, now?
Sure, lunch is
overrated anyway.
Just give me a second.
OK.
What's your objective?
I don't know.
Um...
to work with kids.
Paul... I know I
said this before,
but you gonna have to be real careful
about this kind of thing.
It's just that people are weird
when it comes to their kids.
What do you think I'm
gonna do, Russell?
Eat them?
Of course not, Paul.
I didn't mean that.
It's just...
Look, are you gonna
help me with this or not?
Hi.
Remember me?
I certainly do.
Oh, good.
I thought I'd
bring that back.
Thank you.
Okay.
Good.
Hello?
Hi, it's me.
Oh, hi.
Don't sound so excited.
No, I just thought you might be
calling about a job or something.
Oh. Sorry.
Wanna go out and get drunk?
No, I think I'm gonna call
my folks, hit the sack.
- How are your folks?
- They're good.
Dad's gonna retire
from the pharmacy soon,
and Mom's been taking Greek.
Greek?
I thought you said she was
taking cooking classes.
Greek cooking.
You didn't let me finish.
Well it's getting late.
I better call them so...
Okay.
Talk to you tomorrow.
Okay.
Bye.
Bathroom is clean.
Tyler's asleep and...
diaphragm in.
Um...
Okay Phil, it's Wednesday...
So tell me Dr. Baker, with
reports of child abductions...
reaching an all-time high,
what are the most common...
characteristics of a child
molester that our viewers...
should be on the
look-out for?
Pedophiles tend to share
four major characteristics.
One, they are usually male,
over 25 and often unmarried.
I'm gay, I don't
have any kids.
Two, they are socially
awkward with adults.
Three, they are skilled
at relating to children.
And four, they tend to
refer to children as "pure",
"innocent," or "sweet".
Such a sweet little boy.
Hello?
Mr. Johnson?
Mm-hmm...
Hi, my name is Grant Sweet.
I manage the Toys for
Boys 'n Girls at the mall...
Yeah?
And I do have an opening,
but I should tell you...
I think you may
be overqualified...
I need a stock boy.
Stock boy.
A boy who stocks.
I can do that.
We call this the jungle area.
That's the little
princess area.
Those are hats.
We're not here to play, Paul.
This is a toy store.
Got it. Right.
No playing.
Now remember it's
"Toys for Boys 'n Girls"...
not "and Girls."
- Boys 'n Girls?
- Boys 'n Girls.
Like boysenberry.
Boys 'n Girls.
Boys 'n Girls.
Oh, I've got to
get Lindsay home;
it's almost time for
"Magic School Bus."
Isn't she a little young for that?
Oh, she doesn't
watch it, I do.
Bye.
Can you say, "Paul"?
Paul.
Can you say, "Uncle Paul"?
- No.
- C'mon.
Uncle Paul, say "Uncle Paul".
No.
She's not much of a talker.
Yeah?
Not like me,
I'm a chatterbox.
- Oh yeah?
- Oh, yeah.
Squawk, squawk, squawk!
Right, honey?
Squawk, squawk, squawk!
Squawk!
Buk-buk-bgok!
Squawk.
Coo. Coo. Coo.
Coo. Coo.
Cock-a-doodle-doo!
Gobble, gobble, gobble!
Gobble, gobble, gobble!
Polly wanna cracker?
OK. Come on, honey.
It's time to go.
We'll see you
tomorrow. Bye.
Paul can you save my toys?
Sure.
- OK. Bye.
- Bye.
Bye, honey, we'll
see you tomorrow.
What are you doing?
I thought we could go out
and celebrate my new job.
Oh, give me a second.
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up,
hurry up, hurry up.
Come on.
Well, congratulations, honey.
I'm very proud of you.
I bet you're gonna be the best
stockboy that place has ever seen.
Thank you.
And thank you for helping
me get my act together.
You're the best.
I love you...
Russell Trotter.
Well, I gotta go.
I gotta work in the morning!
But um, maybe we'll have
dinner tomorrow.
Yeah, great.
Yeah, please.
Hey... look what
this one can do.
I saw the cutest
thing yesterday...
Do you remember that guy
from a few weeks ago?
The one we saw at the other place?
You know the one...
The one we couldn't
figure out which kid was his?
Yeah, that's him.
So he's in the
sandbox with Lindsay and Ashley.
Yeah.
They're playing something,
I don't know what.
Right.
And I go over to get Lindsay
to take her home for her nap...
And he, this is so cute,
he is trying to get Lindsay...
to call him "Uncle Paul."
Isn't that cute?
Uncle Paul.
No, that's not cute.
That's not cute.
That's terrifying.
He doesn't have any children.
What?
No kids.
I asked him.
Well, who's he been
bringing to the playground?
No one.
Then why is he there?
Think, Susan.
Oh, my God.
Yeah.
On your mark, get set, go!
You fake them.
Go. Go.
Go. Go.
Aah!
Oh!
Oh.
Who's next?
Honey, I'm going
to go to the mall...
do you need anything?
OK. C'mon, Tyler,
come on, honey.
Let's go shopping.
Maybe we can buy
Daddy a personality.
OK?
Maybe not.
What?
No, honey.
Remember?
It's not a toy day.
It's a shopping-for-a-
birthday-present-day.
OK?
We talked about that, sweetie.
It has wheels.
It does have
wheels. It's green and pretty.
Look at these trains.
He'd like that huh?
- He would like this.
- Yeah?
La, la, la, la.
- I have to go pee pee.
- What?
I have to go potty.
Oh, um.
We'll go potty.
Excuse me.
I need you to get your
manager right away.
- Now. Now.
- OK. Sure.
Come on sweetheart.
Dammit.
I know, you're right.
Hold on, honey.
Hold on, we're almost there.
You quit?
Yeah.
Well, sort of.
Mr. Sweet called me into
his office and told me...
I had to stop talking to the kids.
- And?
- And I told him that I didn't...
want his stupid stockboy job if
I couldn't talk to the kids.
He said, "Too bad."
I said, "Fine" and I quit.
He said that was
probably a good thing anyway.
Jesus. I'm sorry.
Why doesn't he want you
talking to the kids?
I don't know.
But listen, um,
I have this idea.
- Tell me what you think.
- OK.
I'm gonna register with
a babysitting service.
Uh-huh.
Can I help you, sir?
I'm here for the interview.
Sir, you don't have to
interview to hire...
one of Sitter-Spin's Sitters.
No, I'm...
I'm sorry, I must
have misunderstood the ad.
Never can be too careful.
Of course.
I almost envy you
girls... getting to meet...
all those different kids, play
with all those different kids.
Hold 'em on your lap,
tell 'em stories.
Tuck them in to bed.
Oh, Sitter-Spin!
I just got that.
OK, well.
Well, that's annoying.
I don't think the whole
corporate babysitting thing...
is really the way to
go for me, you know?
I'm more individual than
that, don't you think?
And the thing is, nobody wants
to do anything about anything.
It's like the guy at the toy
store didn't even believe me.
He didn't even want to talk to the
guy until I pressed the issue.
I mean, everyone just sits around
waiting for someone else...
to take care of it.
Well, I'm not gonna
be that other guy...
the one who's waiting, I mean.
I mean, no, I am not.
Excuse me, do you know
what happened to...
the babysitting flyers
that were up there?
We need to speak to
someone immediately.
- I'll be right with you.
- Oh, great. Thank you.
Um, Mag?
Yeah?
Um, I'm not so sure
this is a good idea.
What?
He seems like, I don't know,
he seems like a nice guy.
That's what makes
him dangerous. OK?
Just don't be so naive.
This is how these people work.
But he was playing
with Lindsay...
and we did, um, bird calls.
Bird calls?
You did bird calls?
And you think that is some
sort of character assessment?
Susan, look at me.
You need to look at me.
Look at me.
I want you to listen very
carefully... that is exactly...
the kind of thing that
a pedophile would do.
They lure you in.
They, they earn your trust.
Take advantage of
your good nature.
And then,
once you're sure,
once you've finally
let down your guard,
and you are relaxed,
that's when he's gonna move in...
and hurt your child.
He's laying the groundwork
for something really terrible.
You know this for a fact?
You have proof?
He's gay.
He's single.
He hangs around
the playground. Alone.
He fits the profile.
He says right here, "I know
what your children need!"
I'll tell you what, why don't
I take one of these flyers...
and I'll pay our
little pervert a visit.
Excellent.
Thank you so much.
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.
- Bye, ladies.
- Thank you, sir.
I have been picking these
up all over town...
the last couple of days.
I just have to say,
I'm very concerned for...
the safety of our children.
As some of you know, this man
has been seen coming alone...
to the playgrounds,
playing with our children...
and trying to
persuade them...
to call him "Uncle Paul".
I think it's clear
what we have here.
Paul Johnson is a
sexual predator.
And he needs to be stopped.
Now we contacted the police,
and after following up,
I found out... they did nothing.
If the police won't do
anything, what can we do?
Good question.
What can we do?
What should we do?
Just wait around until he
lures one of our children...
back to his house?
I don't think so.
Take precautions?
Absolutely.
But that is not enough.
Listen...
Jesus! what's with the
get-up, Homo the Clown?
What do you think?
Pretty good, huh?
I thought it might present
more job opportunities...
I see.
This is a career move?
Here's what I propose.
I propose a city-wide
awareness campaign.
Here, here.
I always wanted to say that.
What do you think
about adopting?
Me, adopting?
You want to start a city-wide
"awareness campaign"...
about a pedophile?
You want to adopt a baby?
Exactly.
Wow, that's pretty serious.
Why can't I adopt a baby?
Gay men do it all the time.
What proof do you have?
He doesn't have children, and
he's hanging out in playground...
Have you thought
this thing through, Paul?
Have you thought about
how something like that...
will completely change your life?
So you're doing all
this based on a hunch?
He fits the profile.
Plus I saw him take a little
girl into the bathroom...
at Toys for Boys 'n
Girls where he works.
I mean, it's obvious
what's going on here.
What's going on here is
you're out of your mind.
You know, Leslie,
I think that you should leave.
I gotta go.
You and me both.
What?
He fits the profile!
I just wish you
could understand...
how important this is to me.
Well I'm just glad that all
of you care enough to see...
what is important here.
Hi... hi.
Uh, um, I'm, um,
interested in adopting.
I see.
Do you have an appointment?
No, no, I don't.
Is that a problem?
It's not a problem if
you don't mind coming...
another day when you do have one.
Oh, OK, then.
I'd like to
make an appointment.
Ok, we have an opening the
12th of next month, at 2 PM.
Next month?
You'll need to provide
proof of income,
plus documentation of...
I'm sorry, proof of income?
Why?
You do have a job, don't you?
Well, actually,
not right now.
I'm...
changing...
things.
I'm thinking of
becoming a clown.
Mmm...
Explains the shirt.
But I should have things
all worked out soon...
so the 12th?
Let's not waste any more
of each other's time.
There's really no reason to
schedule you until...
you can meet some
very basic requirements.
The process here is very extensive
and it's clear that you...
Have a nice day.
Hi.
Hello, sir.
I live in the building and
I am selling candy...
to raise money for after-school
activities such as sports and band.
These activities were
designed to keep children...
off the streets and stop
them from using drugs.
Would you like to keep
children off the streets...
and stop them using drugs?
I thought so.
Would you be interested
in buying a candy bar...
or a box of chocolate?
Uh, yeah sure.
Come on in.
I'm kinda broke, but I can
probably afford a candy bar.
This one is good.
Which one is your favorite?
This one.
You uh, had dinner yet?
Yes, sir.
- Promise?
- Promise.
I'll take two of those then,
one for me, one for you.
OK, cool.
Thank you.
Come on in.
Wow.
You like to paint?
Yeah.
Yeah?
What's your name?
Simon.
- I'm Paul.
- Hi Paul.
You want to paint
something, Simon?
Coming.
Yeah?
I'm sorry to bother you.
Have you seen my son?
Hey, hey!!
You're supposed to
paint the canvas...
- Aaaah!
- Aaaah!
Simon!
Simon!
Simon?
Sorry to bother you.
I've checked every apartment.
I'm looking for my son.
Have you seen him?
Simon?
Yeah, is he here?
Yeah, he's right there.
Simon.
What the hell are you doing?
What?
You don't go into strange
people's apartments!
Sorry.
And what are you thinking?
You're an adult,
for Christ sakes!
Sorry.
He was selling candy,
and he saw my paints,
Stay away from my kid.
You understand me?
You come near him again and
I will break your neck...
Oh my God.
I mean, we were
just painting.
You invited some kid you don't
know into your apartment;
of course
his dad freaked out.
We weren't doing
anything wrong!
I'm not saying
you were, Paul,
but you don't bring kids
into your apartment.
God Almighty, no wonder everybody
thinks you're some sort of psycho!
What?
You are acting like
this first-class idiot.
I swear, you haven't got the sense
that God gave a lawnmower.
You don't invite children you
don't know into your house.
And you don't adopt a child
when you're not able...
to provide a home for him.
And no one, no one, is going
to call you to babysit...
their children 'cause
you're passing out some...
stupid flyers on the street.
I don't need you to
talk to me that way.
I've got a
mother for that.
I don't know why I expected
anything different.
This is just another in the long
list of things you don't see.
What?
What don't I see?
Oh, come on, Paul.
No.
Tell me. What?
- You wanna know?
- Yeah.
You really want to know?
Yeah.
I really want to know.
I'm in love with you, Paul.
Doesn't that knock you
ass over tea kettle?
Well?
I can't.
I can't.
Oh great go ahead, run
away, go eat some donuts.
Are you gonna paint
the real world away?
Do me a favor, stay out
of the goddamn playground.
You're gonna get arrested.
Go fuck yourself.
What do you think I've been
doing all this whole time?
What are you looking at?
He hasn't had his medication.
Prepositions don't belong
at the end of sentences.
You keep standing in
the road like that,
you're gonna get hit.
I want you to do a story
on a child molester.
I know that...
Yes, I'll hold.
What's that?
Sock Paul!
It's our rallying cry.
Sock Paul?
Mm-hmm.
And look.
And what are these?
Sock Paul Socks!
Sock Paul Socks.
I see.
I thought we needed a slogan.
You know?
Sock Paul!
Sock Paul!
You know, that's
not a bad idea.
That's a terrible idea.
We need a slogan, a catch phrase...
We need our "Just Say No."
Let me think about it.
Yes, I'm here.
No that's fine.
Yes send a reporter,
any reporter.
Working late?
Way to meet those
incentive plans, Russell.
You know I live for
incentive plans.
Well, don't stay too long.
All work and no play
makes Russell...
A dull boy, I know.
Well, I was gonna say, "late
for work in the morning",
but that works, too.
Uh, it's a mirror!
Yes, but what you see?
What do you see, Paul?
What do you see?
- In a mirror?
- Yes!
- Uh...
- Come on!
It's, uh,
it's, um, your face?
Time!
It's reflection.
Oh.
Reflection.
Sorry.
Karen?
Hi, Karen it's Maggie.
Butler.
Well, Hampton.
From Catholic High?
Right.
Good, yes.
How are you?
Listen, Karen I know that you're
on the Entertainment Beat,
but I could really
use a favor.
What's she saying?
Well, I'm having a press
conference here tomorrow...
to alert people to a child
molester in our area.
It would be great if you
could send somebody...
anybody from the station
to cover it.
- What?
- What?
Of course I have proof.
Of course I do.
I saw it.
Yeah, I um...
I saw him take a little
girl into the bathroom...
at the toy store where he works.
And then when she came out,
she was crying.
I know, it's awful...
You did?
Oh, someone from the
news desk would be great.
Thank you so much.
Everything's gonna
be alright, Paul.
Yeah, I know.
What are you
doing tomorrow?
Maybe go out to the gorge
and go for a hike or something.
Want some company?
No, I don't think so.
It's just...
everyone's always telling
me I need to grow up,
think things through, so
that's what I'm gonna do.
Take a little time by myself
and think things through.
Hello, I am Maggie
Butler and I am a mother.
I'd like to thank you
all for coming out today.
We're here for a very
important cause; our children.
There is a dangerous
predator on our streets,
and he's prying-no, preying
on the fragile lives of our youth.
We contacted the police.
They said they couldn't
do anything about it.
We contacted the mayor and
she said she couldn't...
do anything about it.
And we contacted Child
Protection Services.
They said it wasn't
their problem.
So we took things
into our own hands.
We are just a small group of
mothers and we are committed...
to bringing our message
directly to you,
because the children
have got to be protected.
Ladies and Gentlemen, I do
not think I overstate...
when I tell you: You are about
to see the new face of evil.
This man, Paul Johnson,
has been seen...
in and around playgrounds
and schoolyards...
trying to lure our children
away from us to commit...
unspeakable acts.
Oh Lord in Heaven.
If anyone has any information
that we could use as evidence...
to arrest and convict
this pedophile,
please contact
us at 555-KIDS.
We know it's only a matter
of time before he succeeds...
in doing irreparable harm
to our children.
I knew he was a sicko.
Second, we are holding a
rally tomorrow at 10am...
at Wilshire Park, declaring the
playground a PEDOPHILE-FREE
ZONE.
From there, we will
officially mount our...
campaign to BRING HIM IN!
Bring him in.
Bring him in.
Bring him in.
Bring him in.
Thank you.
Thank you for your time.
Thank you for coming.
It is so important.
And we all look forward to seeing
all of you tomorrow with us.
Thank you.
Oh Paul, be there.
Be there.
Be there.
Hello? Hello?
Just kidding. I'm not here.
Paul, it's Russell
honey, are you there?
Look, I know we left
things kinda weird,
but I really need
to talk to you.
Now.
Shit.
Alright, call me the
second you get this, okay?
Because I really need to talk to you
about something important...
and I can't
leave it on a message.
So call me, okay?
Call me.
Kelly Ann, I've gotta
go to the office.
There's something
I need to get.
Sarah, honey?
It's Russell.
Sweetheart, we
have a problem.
Honey, I'm home.
Sarah?
Sarah?
Wake up, Phil.
Come on honey it's
a beautiful day...
and we have children to save.
It's raining.
Shut up, Phil.
Dear Russell, I just
want to say I'm sorry.
And we should probably
talk, when you're ready...
I feel really bad for telling
you to "fuck off."
I'd love the chance
to make it up to you.
anything you want, you name it.
Of course, I don't have any
money, so make it cheap.
I also realized just how important
this babysitting thing is to me,
so I'm not giving up
on that yet.
I'm going to spend the
morning handing out flyers...
at some of the
playgrounds around town.
Anyway, Love you, Paul.
P.S. Dinner, later?
Oh, now you lock the door?
Paul?
Paul, are you in there?
C'mon, honey,
answer the door.
Dammit.
Excuse me, is there something
going on in the park today?
Some sort of children's rally.
- Oh, thanks.
- Have a nice day!
It's up to us to
protect our children.
Now is not the
time to be passive,
to wait for the
invitable... the inevitable.
Now is not the time to
tell our children,
"Sorry, sweetheart, we have to
wait until he hurts someone first."
No, now is
the time for action.
There are several
things you can do.
Go home, alert your
neighbors, tell your friends.
Make everyone you see aware
of the danger that is in our midst.
Second, call the
mayor's office.
Don't be afraid.
Tell them how you feel.
Call your local
police precinct.
Put pressure on the law
enforcement of this community...
to bring this offender
in before it's too late!
We must bring him in.
Bring him in.
Bring him in.
Bring him in.
Bring him in.
Bring him in.
Thank you.
I want to tell you, there is
some good news: last night,
after my press conference, I
received several phone calls,
one from a gentleman
named-David Berman-who knows...
this predator personally,
and who has incontrovertible...
proof that he is
a child molester.
And we will hear from
him in a minute.
Again, it is up to us
to protect our children.
What's your name?
Can you
say "Charlie"?
He's so cute I could
just take him home with me.
Thank you.
Well, listen, my name's Paul.
If you ever need a
babysitter, give me a call.
It's him!
It's him!
What, what is it?
It's him!
It's Paul!
It's Paul!
Bring him in!
Bring him in!
Well go!
Get him!
Somebody get him!
It is him!
Get him.
Get him.
I'll watch the
kids, just stop him!
Come on.
I'm right behind you.
Check there.
I'll do it.
I'll do it.
Did you see a guy come
in there just now?
- No, you sure?
- Yeah.
OK.
OK.
Good job, people.
Alright, we're going
back... back to the park.
OK, here we go.
Russell!
Russell!
Can't believe he got away.
Yeah.
Sneaky son of a bitch.
Can't believe it.
Name's Richard Long.
Russell Trotter.
Friends call me Dick.
Nice to meetcha.
You, too.
So I hear this guy's
been convicted of...
child molestation in
six different states.
Really?
I hadn't heard that.
I bet they find bodies
in his basement.
You think?
He's a Class-A
monster, you know?
Wow.
Yeah, it's awful.
Don't worry, we'll get him.
He may have gotten
away from us this time,
but he's nearby,
I can feel it.
Don't worry, buddy.
We'll get the sick
son-of-a-bitch.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Russell.
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, you know.
Say, wanna get out of here?
Sure, let's do that.
What started out as a rally
took a strange turn moments ago...
when Paul Johnson,
alleged child molester,
wandered into the park.
The crowd went wild, chasing
Johnson down the street,
hoping to bring him to justice.
What are you doing here Paul?
What is going on?
You're all over the news.
I don't know.
Honey, it's gonna be
alright. Hi, I'm Russell.
- Elise.
- Nice to meet you.
- Oh my God.
- Is it true?
No!
It's not true.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I know it's not true.
It's just, Paul...
Hello? Hello?
Hey where are you?
My place?
My place, seriously?
Ok, I'll be there
as soon as I can.
Whew.
Okay.
Look, we just need to stay
calm and figure out...
what we're gonna do.
Why is this happening?
What did I do?
I mean, I was just...
hanging out at
playgrounds, and...
trying to get close
to some kids and...
I could just eat you up,
yes I could.
Oh my God.
He hasn't moved or said
a thing in ten minutes.
Paul honey.
What's going on?
He was being chased
by a lynch mob...
that's what was going on.
Are you serious?
As a tombstone.
Sorry.
Okay, okay.
Here's what we're
going to do.
We're just going to face
this thing together.
We have no other choice.
Paul, are you listening?
Everybody here
that loves you,
me and Russell I'm sorry I
don't remember your name...
- Elise.
- And Elise.
And your parents.
We will call your parents
because that will help.
And we are all just going to
go and face this together.
Whoa.
Where I come from we don't
mess with a lynch mob.
Well, what else
do you want to do?
It might just work.
I mean, think about it.
All of us and Paul's parents.
I mean, they've at least
got to listen to us, right?
Paul, we need the phone
number of your parents now.
Well, that's going
to be tricky.
My parents are dead.
What?
When I was six... they owned
the donut shop downtown.
And Dad was trying to fix the
fryer thing with all the grease.
I guess I was bugging him or
something cause he sent me...
outside to play and, uh, well,
the next thing you know,
they're burnt up like curly fries.
So you have been accused
of being a pedophile...
and this is the moment
you choose to tell us...
you've been lying to us the
entire time that we've known you?
Paul, your timing
really bad.
Listen to me.
Listen to me!
I did not do any
of those things.
I'm sorry that I made up
stories about my dead parents...
but I would never hurt...
I know you wouldn't.
I know you wouldn't.
I know you wouldn't.
I know you wouldn't.
This is really weird Paul.
You're a mess.
I may be a mess, but
I am not a pedophile.
We will not give up.
For these are our children
that we are fighting for.
Now I have every of faith
that we will find this Paul Johnson.
All right?
And when we do
we will bring him in!
Bring him in.
Bring him in.
He can't have gotten far.
And we are not
going to stop...
Do you have something
you'd like to add, sir?
It's him.
It's the guy!
We need security.
I need a police officer.
OK, everyone just,
just stay calm...
I have something to say.
We don't want to hear anything
you have to say, pervert!
You know, I think you do.
We don't need to
hear your lies!
Bring him in.
Bring him in.
Bring him in.
Sock Paul!
Sock Paul!
Quiet.
Just be quiet.
Just listen to the man.
He didn't do anything.
This whole thing...
it's ridiculous.
- Do you have children?
- What?
- Do you have any kids!
- No.
Well then shut your mouth,
all right?
You have nothing to say here.
So please, just give me
a minute to explain.
Give it up, Johnson,
you're sick!
No, I'm not.
I'm not sick.
I know I made some mistakes,
but nothing like...
what you people think.
I was just marching with
you, a few minutes ago...
And I heard some awful
things being said about me.
And none of those
things is true.
Like we're supposed
to trust you?
I did mess up.
I did go to the playground but...
only because I wanted
to play with some kids.
I only wanted to start
babysitting because I love kids.
It sounds like excuses to me,
made-up excuses.
Yeah, why should
we believe you?
I don't know.
All I know is I came to the
park this morning to hand out...
some babysitting flyers
and then...
And then you ran.
All right?
If you have nothing to hide,
why would you run?
Yeah, I ran.
I looked up and there were
all these posters, and signs,
and that woman has
a sock on her arm...
I didn't know what to think.
But I came back.
I wouldn't have come back,
I couldn't have come back...
if I had done
any of those terrible things.
Look, if anyone, anyone,
has any proof that I...
did any of that awful stuff,
come up here right now.
You want proof?
How do you explain this?
Yeah.
How do you explain this?
That, that's my godson...
This man is a menace to
society and must be stopped!
Oh yes.
Give me that.
I gave Paul this photograph.
Who are you?
Paul is my son's Godfather.
He's a little odd, yes.
But he'd lay down
his life for my son.
That's exactly the kind of
thing a pedophile would do!
You can't just
breeze in here lady,
and tell us
everything's fine.
Paul Johnson is
a lot of things,
but one thing he isn't
is a child molester.
Aren't you gay?
Well, yeah.
What does that have
to do with anything?!
Well, because...
he fits the profile!
What about the toy store?
What?
I saw you take a little
girl to the bathroom.
Because she had to pee!
Look, I know I screwed up.
OK?
I guess I wasn't thinking
like a... a grownup.
I just...
You just what?
I just a...
We all have a way
of looking at the world, you know?
And mine is a lot more
like your kids than yours.
Where you see a chair and
a sheet, we see a fort.
Where you see a yard full of
leaves waiting to be raked,
we see confetti and thousands
of chances for crunching.
Look, I never meant
to hurt anyone,
least of all...
one of your kids.
But I honestly don't think I did.
Ask 'em.
Ask 'em.
They know.
They'll tell you.
Ask them if they're mad at me
or afraid of me,
or if I have done anything
at all that made them feel bad.
Joey, did Paul
ever do anything to...
I know I went about
this all wrong,
but I promise it wasn't
what you thought.
I just wanted to
have a family again.
Hey, Paul.
Joey here says
he's mad at you.
Yeah, he says you stopped
coming to the playground.
Hi, Monkey.
How's my buddy, huh?
How's my buddy?
But he fit the profile...
I know.
Come on, let's just go home.
All right.
You guys have a safe flight.
I love you, you little monkey.
Come here.
All right baby.
Back on an airplane.
- I love you.
- I love you.
Say hi to Jim for me.
OK. I will.
It's gonna be all right.
What's gonna be all right?
Kidding!
I know.
