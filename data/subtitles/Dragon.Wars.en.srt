2
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,134
My lord.

3
00:06:41,508 --> 00:06:42,609
What's wrong?

4
00:06:42,609 --> 00:06:45,476
She's lost consciousness.

5
00:06:46,613 --> 00:06:49,582
At last, the time has come.

6
00:06:50,584 --> 00:06:51,573
My love...

7
00:06:54,788 --> 00:06:55,812
My love.

8
00:06:56,557 --> 00:06:59,651
My lord... it's a girl.

9
00:07:01,128 --> 00:07:02,891
Her shoulder.

10
00:07:15,642 --> 00:07:17,075
Please have a seat.

11
00:07:20,514 --> 00:07:24,974
Honorable one, what brings you here
at this late hour?

12
00:07:25,185 --> 00:07:29,519
My lord, please listen.

13
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:31,949
Your child...

14
00:07:32,526 --> 00:07:36,986
She will be sacrificed to lmoogi.
That is heaven's will.

15
00:07:37,197 --> 00:07:39,427
How could you say such things?

16
00:07:39,766 --> 00:07:42,667
My wife has just died while giving birth
to my child.

17
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:46,607
Why do you speak this nonsense?

18
00:07:46,607 --> 00:07:47,972
Your child...

19
00:07:48,175 --> 00:07:51,838
...was born with the Yuh Yi Joo which
heaven intended for the Good lmoogi.

20
00:07:52,546 --> 00:07:54,138
The dark lmoogi, the evil Buraki...

21
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:56,710
...has defied the will of heaven...

22
00:07:56,984 --> 00:08:02,012
...and wants what rightfully belongs
to our Good lmoogi.

23
00:08:02,589 --> 00:08:05,558
What are you talking about?

24
00:08:06,727 --> 00:08:10,857
If the dark lmoogi gets hold
of the Yuh Yi Joo...

25
00:08:11,064 --> 00:08:15,636
...an unimaginable disaster will befall
this entire village.

26
00:08:15,636 --> 00:08:19,470
And how can you be sure?

27
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:26,543
The child bears the mark
of the Red Dragon.

28
00:08:27,781 --> 00:08:30,545
How did you know?

29
00:09:31,545 --> 00:09:34,537
Very good!
Soon you'll be able to beat me.

30
00:09:35,182 --> 00:09:36,581
You've taught me well.

31
00:09:37,017 --> 00:09:37,984
Haram...

32
00:09:38,819 --> 00:09:43,017
...we don't have much time left.
They will be here soon.

33
00:09:43,223 --> 00:09:45,088
Yes, I know.

34
00:09:45,292 --> 00:09:49,160
Come, there is someone
you must meet.

35
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:12,552
Haram, bow before the Good lmoogi.

36
00:10:12,552 --> 00:10:15,612
This is the lmoogi that has been
chosen by heaven.

37
00:10:21,561 --> 00:10:25,998
It has to unite with the Yuh Yi Joo
and ascend to heaven.

38
00:10:26,199 --> 00:10:27,534
That is the only way we humans...

39
00:10:27,534 --> 00:10:29,525
...can remain a part of
the great cycle of the world.

40
00:10:29,736 --> 00:10:32,466
Honorable one, do not worry.

41
00:10:33,607 --> 00:10:38,544
The Yuh Yi Joo will be formed inside
Narin's body the day she turns 20.

42
00:10:41,848 --> 00:10:43,839
I've been having
such good dreams lately.

43
00:10:45,619 --> 00:10:49,612
We cannot miss our chance.

44
00:10:57,764 --> 00:10:58,731
From now on...

45
00:10:58,965 --> 00:11:00,933
...always keep it with you.

46
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:07,507
It is a pendant that has been formed
by heaven.

47
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:12,000
It belongs to the guardian of the
Good lmoogi.

48
00:11:12,312 --> 00:11:16,840
This will protect you from danger.

49
00:11:35,602 --> 00:11:37,695
Hey, what's that?

50
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,908
She is here.

51
00:12:21,515 --> 00:12:22,574
Fire!

52
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,594
Fire!

53
00:13:10,765 --> 00:13:12,592
Find the girl!

54
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:05,931

55
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:10,165

56
00:14:37,017 --> 00:14:38,541
Not my daughter!

57
00:14:39,252 --> 00:14:41,618
You are looking for the girl who has
a tattoo on her shoulder!

58
00:14:42,656 --> 00:14:43,623
Aren't you?

59
00:14:44,491 --> 00:14:45,788
I know where she is!

60
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,467
Stop!

61
00:14:54,701 --> 00:14:56,532
How dare you break into my house!

62
00:14:59,205 --> 00:15:00,263
You scoundrels!

63
00:15:00,407 --> 00:15:01,896
Father!

64
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:04,477
Father!

65
00:15:05,245 --> 00:15:06,212
Father!

66
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,838
Narin!

67
00:15:55,862 --> 00:15:57,796
Where...? Where am I?

68
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:02,461
Don't be scared.
This is a secret place.

69
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,737
My father...

70
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:07,600
...my father.

71
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:09,842
I am sorry.

72
00:16:15,115 --> 00:16:16,276
Narin.

73
00:16:18,084 --> 00:16:22,218
Listen...I must tell you something.

74
00:16:20,887 --> 00:16:22,218

75
00:16:29,763 --> 00:16:32,163
Incompetent fools.

76
00:16:32,932 --> 00:16:35,162
You've let them escape!

77
00:16:36,603 --> 00:16:37,865
I should kill you all.

78
00:16:38,705 --> 00:16:41,173
We must find the Yuh Yi Joo.

79
00:16:52,685 --> 00:16:53,652
What's this?

80
00:17:13,006 --> 00:17:14,270
I love you!

81
00:17:15,876 --> 00:17:16,843
Narin!

82
00:22:18,277 --> 00:22:20,013
Master Bochun...

83
00:26:37,203 --> 00:26:38,602
Young man...

84
00:26:39,072 --> 00:26:42,064
...shouldn't you be looking for
the Yuh Yi Joo?

85
00:29:15,861 --> 00:29:16,919
You won't escape this time.

86
00:29:17,997 --> 00:29:19,521
Now you must...

87
00:29:19,598 --> 00:29:20,565
...die!

88
00:31:52,151 --> 00:31:53,140

89
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:57,081
Where do you think you're going?

90
00:41:31,563 --> 00:41:33,463
Rise.

91
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,897
Atrox Army.

92
00:41:43,742 --> 00:41:46,711
The time has come again.

93
00:41:47,112 --> 00:41:48,909
Mighty...

94
00:41:49,314 --> 00:41:50,747
Dawdler!

95
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:12,584
Father!

96
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:16,584
I love you!

97
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:19,456
Narin!

98
00:49:21,532 --> 00:49:23,261
I will wait for you...

99
00:49:23,634 --> 00:49:25,534
...in my next life.

100
00:55:29,201 --> 00:55:32,227
We must possess the Yuh Yi Joo.

101
00:55:33,572 --> 00:55:35,533
500 years we've waited...

102
00:55:35,533 --> 00:55:40,734
...for another chance to change destiny.

103
00:55:40,945 --> 00:55:42,114
Without fail...

104
00:55:42,115 --> 00:55:46,314
...we must deliver her to our altar...

105
00:55:47,049 --> 00:55:49,554
...where Buraki awaits to transform into a dragon!

106
00:55:49,554 --> 00:55:53,182
Then he shall rise to the heavens.

107
00:55:53,492 --> 00:55:57,258
Bulcos, find her!

108
01:03:58,642 --> 01:04:02,543
Destroy all those who stand in our way.

109
01:10:46,650 --> 01:10:48,618
Bring her to the altar...

110
01:10:49,052 --> 01:10:51,577
...for the sacrifice.

111
01:10:59,529 --> 01:11:00,087
Silence him!

112
01:11:06,069 --> 01:11:07,331
And now...

113
01:11:09,039 --> 01:11:11,830
...time to fulfill our will.

114
01:11:11,942 --> 01:11:13,009
Buraki!

115
01:11:13,043 --> 01:11:14,640
Rise! Mighty!

116
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Buraki!

117
01:11:16,113 --> 01:11:17,980
Rise! Mighty!

118
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,079
Buraki!

119
01:11:19,100 --> 01:11:22,676
We offer the Yuh Yi Joo!

120
01:13:05,289 --> 01:13:07,722
We will not be denied this time...

121
01:13:08,359 --> 01:13:12,219
...even if it means...

122
01:13:13,430 --> 01:13:19,732
...I have to take the Yuh Yi Joo myself.

123
01:13:33,016 --> 01:13:36,543
You will not escape again!

124
