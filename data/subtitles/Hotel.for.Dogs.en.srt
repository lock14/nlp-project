1
00:03:26,301 --> 00:03:27,730
You want some?

2
00:05:00,693 --> 00:05:02,605
- How'd we do?
- $27.

3
00:05:03,063 --> 00:05:05,170
Nobody questions shrink wrap.

4
00:05:08,253 --> 00:05:11,734
- Are you hungry?
- A little bit. The dog probably is a lot.

5
00:05:12,703 --> 00:05:13,720
Good job.

6
00:05:13,794 --> 00:05:15,967
Can you stop touching my hair?

7
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:18,143
Hey, his collar slipped off.

8
00:05:18,213 --> 00:05:20,157
And you waited right here.

9
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,269
What a good boy. Yes, you are!

10
00:05:23,338 --> 00:05:25,446
Oh, we missed you too, buddy.

11
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,130
I hope he knows what we go through
just to feed him.

12
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,405
All right, here you go, Friday.

13
00:05:32,852 --> 00:05:35,537
I've never seen a dog
eat that much. Ever.

14
00:05:39,418 --> 00:05:40,760
Here you go.

15
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:44,027
Nice catch.

16
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:45,461
Go.

17
00:05:45,888 --> 00:05:46,870
Go.

18
00:05:49,347 --> 00:05:50,428
Meet us at home, Friday.

19
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,614
Excuse me, miss.

20
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:54,370
That's her.
She's the one who ripped me off.

21
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,197
Thank goodness you're here, Officer.

22
00:05:56,265 --> 00:05:59,617
This guy's been stalking me all day,
and it's really freaking me out.

23
00:06:19,196 --> 00:06:21,086
Okay, thanks. I really appreciate it.

24
00:06:21,151 --> 00:06:24,024
Either I call you or
I have to fill out all the forms.

25
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,337
- Love to Alice.
- Yeah. Same to Carol.

26
00:06:26,404 --> 00:06:28,611
Central City PD, precinct desk.

27
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,137
Hold on, I'll transfer you.

28
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:34,562
Put it down.

29
00:06:34,637 --> 00:06:36,231
- Hey.
- Hey, Bernie.

30
00:06:37,712 --> 00:06:39,786
Don't "Hey, Bernie" me.

31
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:42,926
You know I have half a mind
to leave you two here?

32
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:46,454
You're sprung. Come on, let's go.

33
00:06:49,179 --> 00:06:50,390
Hurry up.

34
00:06:51,356 --> 00:06:54,776
I'll do the rest of my yelling
while I'm taking you back.

35
00:06:59,492 --> 00:07:01,862
Look, the guy
could have pressed charges.

36
00:07:01,927 --> 00:07:04,612
You sold him a rock in a box
for 20 bucks.

37
00:07:05,514 --> 00:07:07,076
Oh, that's funny?

38
00:07:08,973 --> 00:07:11,562
It's not funny. It's anything but funny.

39
00:07:11,633 --> 00:07:14,635
What if they'd called Carl and Lois
instead of me?

40
00:07:16,403 --> 00:07:20,336
I guess you'd have to find us
new foster parents, then.

41
00:07:22,906 --> 00:07:25,211
Is that what you're trying to do?

42
00:07:25,885 --> 00:07:29,271
You guys, that's
a very dangerous game, I'm telling you.

43
00:07:30,466 --> 00:07:31,415
One and...

44
00:07:36,168 --> 00:07:37,151
No.

45
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:41,859
You know, the word "harmonizing"
comes from the word "harmony."

46
00:07:41,932 --> 00:07:44,970
- So?
- So I'm saying you're still half a step off.

47
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,009
Oh, really? Well, that's funny
because my vocal instructor,

48
00:07:48,082 --> 00:07:51,980
who is a paid vocal instructor,
didn't notice that, but you did.

49
00:07:52,053 --> 00:07:53,616
Here's the note.

50
00:08:02,464 --> 00:08:04,539
You're late.
And you interrupted rehearsal.

51
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:06,103
I'm very sorry.

52
00:08:06,466 --> 00:08:08,290
Get in there. Hurry up.

53
00:08:09,413 --> 00:08:12,450
Babe, maybe we should skip this one
and just play the hit.

54
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,240
- They're all hits, baby.
- You're right.

55
00:08:15,307 --> 00:08:17,064
- Hey, Bernie.
- Carl.

56
00:08:17,132 --> 00:08:19,075
Your food's on your trays.

57
00:08:21,873 --> 00:08:24,264
Yummy! It's too bad we already ate.

58
00:08:24,339 --> 00:08:26,763
Fine. It'll be lunch tomorrow.

59
00:08:26,838 --> 00:08:30,004
All right, could we just get back
to the issue at hand, okay?

60
00:08:30,072 --> 00:08:31,897
I'm a kind woman. Okay?

61
00:08:32,571 --> 00:08:36,316
In fact, everyone's always asking,
"Lois, why are you so kind?"

62
00:08:37,439 --> 00:08:39,034
But we have rules. Okay?

63
00:08:39,105 --> 00:08:43,365
We serve dinner at a certain time, so
we can finish dinner at a certain time.

64
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:47,262
So we can drop our rock manifesto
on the world at a certain time.

65
00:08:50,733 --> 00:08:54,184
Okay, but those times have come
and gone. So...

66
00:08:54,255 --> 00:08:55,630
Oh, where were they?

67
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:02,291
Look, this whole thing is my fault. Okay?

68
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:07,320
We were just getting caught up
and we were having so much fun...

69
00:09:07,388 --> 00:09:08,698
Whoa. Yeah.

70
00:09:08,765 --> 00:09:12,446
...that I just lost track of time.
I'm sorry, really. My apologies.

71
00:09:12,512 --> 00:09:14,456
Now, why don't we just
get them to their room

72
00:09:14,531 --> 00:09:19,457
and you guys can continue
making that magic.

73
00:09:28,752 --> 00:09:31,471
- Thanks for covering for us.
- Andi, Andi. Listen!

74
00:09:31,538 --> 00:09:33,811
You cannot afford to screw this up.

75
00:09:33,878 --> 00:09:36,268
You've only been here
two months, okay?

76
00:09:36,343 --> 00:09:39,028
This is your fifth set
of foster parents in three years.

77
00:09:39,098 --> 00:09:42,451
The Johnsons don't count,
we were there for two hours.

78
00:09:44,031 --> 00:09:45,557
Do you know the reaction I get
when I tell people

79
00:09:45,632 --> 00:09:47,936
I'm trying to place
11 and 16-year-old siblings?

80
00:09:48,002 --> 00:09:51,486
It ain't a good one. Okay?
You guys mess this up, that's it.

81
00:09:51,558 --> 00:09:53,084
I don't have any more favors
I can call in.

82
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:55,200
I'm gonna have to
place you two separately.

83
00:09:55,272 --> 00:09:58,659
No! You know I won't
let that happen, Bernie.

84
00:09:58,732 --> 00:10:00,142
We stay together.

85
00:10:00,206 --> 00:10:02,279
All right, then
take a little advice from me, okay?

86
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:05,584
A technique that I've learned.
When somebody who I...

87
00:10:06,612 --> 00:10:10,029
...who I don't particularly like is saying
something that I don't want to hear,

88
00:10:10,102 --> 00:10:13,140
I just nod and I go, "Mmm-hmm."
It works wonders.

89
00:10:13,786 --> 00:10:14,964
Mmm-hmm.

90
00:10:19,743 --> 00:10:21,982
Okay, I'm through with you guys.

91
00:10:24,517 --> 00:10:26,590
I'll tell you what, I better not get
any more phone calls

92
00:10:26,661 --> 00:10:29,731
about a trick with a brick
or a scam with a ham...

93
00:10:38,994 --> 00:10:43,055
Okay, it was a good talk, Bernie.
Thank you very much for stopping by.

94
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:44,851
What are you guys...

95
00:11:00,935 --> 00:11:03,457
Good boy. Somebody's tired today, huh?

96
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:05,122
I am.

97
00:11:56,218 --> 00:11:57,363
Friday.

98
00:11:59,004 --> 00:12:00,631
- Andi.
- Yeah.

99
00:12:00,701 --> 00:12:02,429
- Friday's gone.
- What?

100
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:07,394
- Friday, come here.
- Where'd he go?

101
00:12:11,816 --> 00:12:13,028
Good God.

102
00:12:13,514 --> 00:12:15,938
You two are just a bundle of energy.

103
00:12:17,293 --> 00:12:18,703
Good morning!

104
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:20,871
Stop shouting.

105
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:25,839
My vocal instructor said getting
frightened is bad for my pitch.

106
00:12:25,909 --> 00:12:27,635
What are you doing up so early?

107
00:12:27,704 --> 00:12:30,389
- Just thought we'd get some...
- Breakfast!

108
00:12:31,803 --> 00:12:34,841
All right, so, I unlocked the pantry.

109
00:12:34,911 --> 00:12:37,563
Your cereal's in there.
You know how to get it.

110
00:12:37,633 --> 00:12:39,740
I'm not your servant. All right?

111
00:12:39,811 --> 00:12:43,645
I am obliged to prepare two meals
a day, that's lunch and dinner.

112
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,147
Friday!

113
00:12:46,667 --> 00:12:47,714
What?

114
00:12:48,106 --> 00:12:51,425
I said,
"Bruce, what is the day after Thursday?"

115
00:12:51,502 --> 00:12:53,031
- Friday!
- Thanks.

116
00:12:53,584 --> 00:12:56,269
Fine. Get weird on me.
I can handle weird.

117
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:07,543
Okay, I don't need your attitude
about setting the table, okay?

118
00:13:07,614 --> 00:13:09,043
Don't be lazy.

119
00:13:13,505 --> 00:13:14,653
It needs cinnamon.

120
00:13:14,724 --> 00:13:17,444
Or is it cinnamon that Carl's allergic to?

121
00:13:18,152 --> 00:13:20,486
Well, one way to find out, I guess.

122
00:13:20,554 --> 00:13:23,623
Let's see him harmonize
with a tongue the size of a beehive.

123
00:13:23,693 --> 00:13:26,478
Wait! You just reminded me
of this really funny story.

124
00:13:26,543 --> 00:13:28,549
I was walking and I stepped on a bee
and it stung me.

125
00:13:28,622 --> 00:13:30,797
So then, I went and took care of my foot,

126
00:13:30,866 --> 00:13:34,896
then I went back for the bee
to throw it outside and I thought,

127
00:13:34,966 --> 00:13:37,936
"You know, I'd be safe because
bees can't sting you more than once."

128
00:13:38,009 --> 00:13:41,657
Right? I mean, right? It was crazy.
I mean, isn't that crazy?

129
00:13:43,359 --> 00:13:44,505
Excuse me.

130
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:47,840
You owe me 30 seconds of my life,
and I will collect.

131
00:13:55,722 --> 00:13:57,000
Thanks for the heart attack.

132
00:13:57,067 --> 00:13:59,557
Of course I checked in there,
maybe they're in the kids' room.

133
00:13:59,629 --> 00:14:01,932
Carl, did you eat the bacon?

134
00:14:01,998 --> 00:14:03,692
Stay close, Friday.

135
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:12,051
Did I leave my whitening strips in here?

136
00:15:28,289 --> 00:15:31,041
He'd usually be here by now.

137
00:15:31,107 --> 00:15:33,149
You know, maybe he can't hear it.

138
00:15:33,222 --> 00:15:35,590
It's mealtime.
He could hear it on the moon.

139
00:15:35,656 --> 00:15:38,113
He's probably just wandering around.

140
00:15:43,502 --> 00:15:45,578
Friday! Friday!

141
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:50,676
- What are we gonna do?
- Come on. Friday!

142
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,273
Friday! Come on!
Maybe he ran down this alley.

143
00:15:57,436 --> 00:15:58,866
Friday!

144
00:16:02,111 --> 00:16:04,766
You don't think he went in there,
do you?

145
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:12,774
No. Why would he go in there?
He's probably just out looking for food.

146
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:14,979
Friday!

147
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:18,315
How cute. I want one.

148
00:16:28,441 --> 00:16:29,851
Nice haircut.

149
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,110
Thanks, Dave.
I was hoping you'd notice.

150
00:16:34,174 --> 00:16:36,960
Oh, I was actually
talking about the Pomeranian.

151
00:16:37,026 --> 00:16:39,678
But yours is, yours is really nice, too.

152
00:16:39,747 --> 00:16:42,368
- You did something new to it.
- I did.

153
00:16:42,439 --> 00:16:44,612
And I'm pretty sure you could tell
when I first got it done

154
00:16:44,681 --> 00:16:46,920
because you kind of looked at me
and then looked away,

155
00:16:46,987 --> 00:16:49,128
and then looked back like,
"Hey, something's different."

156
00:16:49,197 --> 00:16:51,500
But then you didn't say anything
and I was like, "Men."

157
00:16:51,567 --> 00:16:53,675
So then the next day I tried
to compliment you on your hair,

158
00:16:53,745 --> 00:16:55,339
you know,
giving you a little hint here but...

159
00:16:55,412 --> 00:16:58,830
No, absolutely. I totally remember that.
Anyways, it looks great.

160
00:17:06,588 --> 00:17:08,051
Can I help you?

161
00:17:11,681 --> 00:17:14,269
No, no, we're just looking for our dog.

162
00:17:14,787 --> 00:17:17,473
I don't suppose you've seen him,
have you?

163
00:17:18,022 --> 00:17:19,432
No.

164
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:21,538
Friday? That's a funny name.

165
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:26,155
I bet when you find him, you'll say,
"Thank God it's Friday."

166
00:17:27,727 --> 00:17:30,894
Right? It's a joke. So...

167
00:17:31,956 --> 00:17:34,349
I don't think
I've ever seen you around here before.

168
00:17:34,423 --> 00:17:38,419
- Do you go to Thomas Jefferson?
- I will actually, in the fall. Andi.

169
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:39,732
Dave.

170
00:17:39,805 --> 00:17:42,195
My family just moved here
a couple of months ago.

171
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,858
That's cool. How do you like it so far?

172
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:46,972
What's not to like?

173
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:52,800
- We have to go.
- No problem.

174
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:58,059
You know, if he doesn't show up soon,
you might want to check the pound.

175
00:18:30,764 --> 00:18:32,839
- Friday! Friday! There he is!
- There he is.

176
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:34,472
- There he is.
- There he is! Friday! Friday!

177
00:18:34,543 --> 00:18:36,781
- Your dog?
- Yeah, that's our dog!

178
00:18:49,565 --> 00:18:51,291
Yeah, he just got in.

179
00:18:51,967 --> 00:18:54,108
Yeah, I know, we just saw him.

180
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:57,920
Well, I'm always glad
when these things have a happy ending.

181
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:00,445
We're open till 6:00. Get your parents,
come back, we'll figure it out.

182
00:19:00,518 --> 00:19:01,949
Wait! Wait...

183
00:19:02,024 --> 00:19:05,027
Come on, we're already here.
It's our dog.

184
00:19:06,093 --> 00:19:09,642
Yeah, well, there's a lot of paperwork.
Grown-up paperwork.

185
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,457
There's always a guy
who screws up the paperwork.

186
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:15,119
But you see this guy? I'm not that guy.

187
00:19:50,134 --> 00:19:51,924
We can't let him out alone anymore.

188
00:19:51,991 --> 00:19:54,963
I mean, if he gets picked up again,
we might not get him back.

189
00:19:55,036 --> 00:19:58,615
And things are gonna get
so much harder when school starts.

190
00:19:59,551 --> 00:20:02,870
Look, Bruce, I think we need
to find Friday a new home.

191
00:20:04,196 --> 00:20:05,922
- Well, you know, I've got a few ideas.
- No.

192
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:08,096
We've been hiding him
in alleys and garages,

193
00:20:08,167 --> 00:20:10,591
in the woods for three years.

194
00:20:12,268 --> 00:20:16,328
Don't you think he deserves
a real home with a real family?

195
00:20:17,713 --> 00:20:19,655
But we are a real family.

196
00:20:27,898 --> 00:20:29,722
Let's get out of here.

197
00:20:35,712 --> 00:20:39,065
- You kids! Hold it right there!
- We can't get in trouble again.

198
00:20:39,141 --> 00:20:42,853
- But we didn't do anything wrong.
- You want to tell them that?

199
00:20:57,396 --> 00:20:58,739
Oh, my God.

200
00:21:11,234 --> 00:21:13,570
- Friday! No! Get back here!
- Bruce!

201
00:21:15,621 --> 00:21:16,832
Come on.

202
00:21:32,918 --> 00:21:34,743
- You got anything?
- No.

203
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:38,071
Forget it.

204
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,441
Let's just find Friday
and get out of here.

205
00:21:48,997 --> 00:21:50,142
Friday!

206
00:21:53,802 --> 00:21:55,461
Circuits are fried.

207
00:21:56,269 --> 00:21:57,416
Friday!

208
00:22:02,448 --> 00:22:04,077
Bruce, stay close.

209
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:09,463
Wow. Andi, look at all this stuff.

210
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:21,886
Careful.

211
00:22:23,271 --> 00:22:24,417
Friday?

212
00:22:34,512 --> 00:22:37,448
Friday, where are you, boy?

213
00:22:43,128 --> 00:22:45,616
- What's that?
- It's just an old hotel.

214
00:22:47,707 --> 00:22:49,083
Hotels don't make footsteps.

215
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:53,211
People make footsteps when they walk
through hotels with their feet.

216
00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:59,363
Good point. Come on!

217
00:23:02,953 --> 00:23:04,297
Go, go, go!

218
00:23:32,935 --> 00:23:34,528
Friday, stay back.

219
00:23:52,601 --> 00:23:54,992
Do you think they belong to anyone?

220
00:23:55,453 --> 00:23:57,144
If they did, would they be here?

221
00:23:57,213 --> 00:23:59,319
Better here than the pound.

222
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:00,801
Friday! Wait!

223
00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:22,446
- Look at that.
- Okay.

224
00:24:36,482 --> 00:24:40,064
What about just, you know,
leaving Friday with them tonight?

225
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,096
One night.

226
00:24:57,205 --> 00:25:00,208
Good night, guys. Sleep tight.

227
00:25:25,328 --> 00:25:28,201
So I mean it's supposed to be
a teacher appreciation lunch, right?

228
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:30,131
But then it ends up
being more work for us

229
00:25:30,196 --> 00:25:32,172
if we have to set it up
and then clean it up.

230
00:25:32,246 --> 00:25:33,261
I mean, sometimes, you know,

231
00:25:33,336 --> 00:25:36,754
I could appreciate
a little less appreciation, you know?

232
00:25:36,827 --> 00:25:40,409
Don't nod and "Mmm-hmm" me.
I taught you the nod and "Mmm-hmm."

233
00:25:40,479 --> 00:25:43,000
Yeah, that's true,
but I'd like to think I've made it my own.

234
00:25:43,073 --> 00:25:44,383
Oh, really?

235
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:51,041
- What's wrong?
- It's these kids, the other night.

236
00:25:52,074 --> 00:25:54,346
- Andi and Bruce?
- Yeah.

237
00:25:54,413 --> 00:25:56,802
- Are they okay?
- I don't know.

238
00:25:56,877 --> 00:25:59,849
I mean, it's bad enough
they lost their parents.

239
00:26:00,305 --> 00:26:01,833
If they can't work this situation out,

240
00:26:01,908 --> 00:26:03,500
I don't know if we're gonna be able
to find a family

241
00:26:03,571 --> 00:26:05,778
that's gonna take the both of them.

242
00:26:05,845 --> 00:26:07,790
You do everything you can for them,
you know.

243
00:26:07,864 --> 00:26:11,281
You can't bring home
your work and let it make you crazy.

244
00:26:12,411 --> 00:26:14,104
- You're right.
- Yeah.

245
00:26:14,493 --> 00:26:16,404
- Love you.
- Love you, too.

246
00:26:17,889 --> 00:26:20,739
It's too bad.
You know, they really are good kids.

247
00:26:27,594 --> 00:26:30,564
It's three hungry dogs.
Grab as much as you can.

248
00:26:43,801 --> 00:26:45,744
That's quite a load there.

249
00:26:47,421 --> 00:26:49,211
Yeah. Just getting some breakfast.

250
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:52,096
What, are you feeding
the whole neighborhood?

251
00:26:54,658 --> 00:26:57,858
Okay, you wouldn't even touch this
the first time.

252
00:26:57,927 --> 00:27:00,680
I don't eat, you're angry.
I eat, you're angry.

253
00:27:00,746 --> 00:27:04,393
Okay, fine, people, eat.
Lucky for you I saved your dinners.

254
00:27:05,388 --> 00:27:07,301
You can start with those.

255
00:27:16,953 --> 00:27:18,163
Come on.

256
00:27:32,551 --> 00:27:33,959
What is that?

257
00:27:37,676 --> 00:27:40,396
You know, if you would eat
the meals I make,

258
00:27:40,464 --> 00:27:42,352
you wouldn't be so hungry
in the morning.

259
00:27:42,416 --> 00:27:44,940
You're right. Thank you so much, Lois.

260
00:28:00,032 --> 00:28:01,048
Done.

261
00:28:08,424 --> 00:28:09,538
I'm hearing something.

262
00:28:32,191 --> 00:28:33,239
What?

263
00:28:40,743 --> 00:28:44,063
- What's his problem?
- I don't know. Why are you asking me?

264
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:45,864
Stop howling, please.

265
00:29:07,743 --> 00:29:10,114
Yes, I'd like to call in a complaint
about a howling dog.

266
00:29:16,938 --> 00:29:18,051
That's it?

267
00:29:18,123 --> 00:29:20,973
All that just so
you could look out a window?

268
00:29:24,432 --> 00:29:25,742
Never mind.

269
00:29:47,685 --> 00:29:50,437
Wow. Even Lenny
and Georgia won't touch it.

270
00:29:52,554 --> 00:29:54,498
We need to go get
some real dog food for them.

271
00:29:54,572 --> 00:29:56,329
Wait, who?

272
00:29:56,397 --> 00:29:58,986
Lenny and Georgia.
That's what I named the new dogs.

273
00:29:59,055 --> 00:30:00,267
No. No naming them.

274
00:30:00,337 --> 00:30:01,713
If you name them,
you're gonna get attached.

275
00:30:01,779 --> 00:30:05,524
Andi, look at her.
Tell me she's not a Georgia.

276
00:30:05,589 --> 00:30:06,671
Bruce, I'm not kidding, okay?

277
00:30:06,743 --> 00:30:09,680
I'm glad
that Friday's getting along well with

278
00:30:09,755 --> 00:30:14,166
dog number one and dog number two,
but we're barely keeping our dog safe.

279
00:30:14,238 --> 00:30:16,761
I mean, do you know what happens
if we get caught in here?

280
00:30:16,833 --> 00:30:19,225
Trespassing, breaking and entering.

281
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:23,044
You heard what Bernie said.
They'd split us up and ship us off.

282
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:25,254
Are you even listening?

283
00:30:45,755 --> 00:30:47,700
So I'll stay here and keep them quiet

284
00:30:47,773 --> 00:30:51,422
while you go out
and get some real food. Okay?

285
00:30:52,803 --> 00:30:56,702
Okay, fine. But just for now.
And I'll be back.

286
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:02,244
Stay, Friday. Stay, Georgia.

287
00:31:05,231 --> 00:31:07,239
You better keep them quiet.

288
00:31:48,758 --> 00:31:50,036
You like to fetch.

289
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:03,388
- Hey. I see you found your dog.
- Yeah. He's fine.

290
00:32:04,037 --> 00:32:05,468
That's great.

291
00:32:06,312 --> 00:32:10,057
- Can I help you find anything?
- No, just getting some dog food.

292
00:32:10,443 --> 00:32:14,505
- That's 40 pounds, by the way.
- Yeah, that's probably right.

293
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,675
For that little dog on the flier,
40 pounds?

294
00:32:17,746 --> 00:32:20,236
Well, the thing is, I actually...
I have three dogs,

295
00:32:20,308 --> 00:32:21,935
two of them are strays.

296
00:32:22,006 --> 00:32:25,140
- My parents, they just love animals.
- That's great.

297
00:32:26,329 --> 00:32:29,148
Yeah. You know, they're the best.
I'm really lucky.

298
00:32:29,213 --> 00:32:33,306
We have this big yard
and we just rescue dogs all the time.

299
00:32:34,978 --> 00:32:38,178
- All the time?
- Well, yeah, whenever.

300
00:32:40,742 --> 00:32:43,079
You know what? Here, come with me.

301
00:32:48,912 --> 00:32:50,768
- They're so cute.
- Yeah.

302
00:32:53,557 --> 00:32:54,834
We adopt out dogs here,

303
00:32:54,901 --> 00:32:57,685
but we can't get anybody
to take these guys.

304
00:32:58,392 --> 00:33:01,843
They're not puppies anymore,
and everybody always wants puppies.

305
00:33:01,916 --> 00:33:02,932
Tell me about it.

306
00:33:03,005 --> 00:33:06,139
They're also kind of...
Well, they're loveably defective.

307
00:33:06,208 --> 00:33:09,560
Cooper, he's my favorite.
I think he's actually half goat.

308
00:33:09,634 --> 00:33:11,546
There's not a substance on Earth
he can't chew through.

309
00:33:11,621 --> 00:33:15,999
He's been through pocketbooks,
cell phones, shoes, handbags,

310
00:33:16,072 --> 00:33:18,595
even ate through a license plate once.

311
00:33:19,627 --> 00:33:21,059
This is Shep.

312
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:25,419
Yeah, she's got some herding issues.

313
00:33:29,429 --> 00:33:31,154
- Pushy.
- I like pushy.

314
00:33:32,599 --> 00:33:34,641
So, they've got quirks.
I mean, they're still adorable.

315
00:33:34,713 --> 00:33:38,099
Good, I'm glad you think so,
because you're taking them.

316
00:33:38,173 --> 00:33:39,832
What? No.

317
00:33:44,259 --> 00:33:46,017
The owner says
we can't keep them forever

318
00:33:46,085 --> 00:33:50,147
and if I can't find a place to put them,
then they're going to the pound.

319
00:33:50,218 --> 00:33:51,974
Look, I'm sorry,
but there's no way that I can just...

320
00:33:52,042 --> 00:33:55,559
You're already taking care
of a few strays, what's three more?

321
00:33:55,631 --> 00:33:58,534
- Three?
- Oh, yeah. You're gonna love this guy.

322
00:33:59,313 --> 00:34:01,738
Romeo. Romeo. Romeo.

323
00:34:04,213 --> 00:34:05,393
Whoa.

324
00:34:08,281 --> 00:34:10,072
What if you just took them
for a little while?

325
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:13,076
Until I can figure something out.
I'll pay for food.

326
00:34:13,149 --> 00:34:16,350
I get an employee discount.
It's the least I can do.

327
00:34:28,012 --> 00:34:32,205
Georgia, I'm sorry, but I can't stand here
all day playing fetch with you.

328
00:34:32,271 --> 00:34:33,801
Georgia, zip it.

329
00:34:35,764 --> 00:34:36,779
No.

330
00:34:40,824 --> 00:34:43,248
Guys, come on! Please! Oh, no!

331
00:34:43,834 --> 00:34:46,904
What's it gonna take for me
to get you guys to...

332
00:34:58,089 --> 00:34:59,586
Sweet ride.

333
00:34:59,659 --> 00:35:03,491
Yeah, it's pretty much a chick magnet.
I'm not gonna lie to you.

334
00:35:04,942 --> 00:35:08,743
Getting close. Right there. That's it.

335
00:35:11,348 --> 00:35:12,723
This is where you live?

336
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:15,641
Actually, my parents are out of town,

337
00:35:15,705 --> 00:35:18,521
so I kind of had to make
other arrangements.

338
00:35:23,648 --> 00:35:26,138
This place looks condemned.
What are we doing here?

339
00:35:26,211 --> 00:35:28,220
It's where we keep the dogs.

340
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:32,158
- Well, are you allowed to be in there?
- No, so let's move it.

341
00:35:37,773 --> 00:35:39,815
All right, guys, watch this.

342
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,187
Ready?

343
00:35:46,614 --> 00:35:49,070
Are you sure it's safe in here?

344
00:35:49,143 --> 00:35:53,141
Yeah. We've been poking around here
for a couple of days, actually.

345
00:35:57,631 --> 00:35:59,804
Okay, that hurt.

346
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:13,293
Hold your fire. Hold your fire.

347
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:18,863
Bruce, you remember Dave, right?
Dave from the pet store.

348
00:36:20,694 --> 00:36:22,451
Hi, Dave.

349
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:25,689
He just needed a place
to keep a couple of dogs

350
00:36:25,753 --> 00:36:28,724
and I thought, you know,
"Hey, we have a place."

351
00:36:29,662 --> 00:36:31,257
So you made this?

352
00:36:31,905 --> 00:36:34,078
Yeah. It's a work in progress.

353
00:36:36,453 --> 00:36:38,977
And how did you learn
how to make that?

354
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:40,834
My dad.

355
00:36:42,121 --> 00:36:45,092
Wouldn't it be easier
just to throw it, though?

356
00:36:45,164 --> 00:36:48,167
Yeah, but that's not really the point.
The point is when I get it working,

357
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,558
she should be able to play fetch
even when we're not here.

358
00:36:54,067 --> 00:36:56,405
Can you give me free pay-per-view?

359
00:36:57,751 --> 00:36:59,279
Oh, poop!

360
00:37:02,716 --> 00:37:04,093
Literally!

361
00:37:04,671 --> 00:37:07,990
What is going on here?
I mean, who poops on the floor?

362
00:37:10,275 --> 00:37:13,378
- Sorry. I need to work on that.
- How did you find us?

363
00:37:13,447 --> 00:37:16,318
I followed the van
with the ears and the tail.

364
00:37:17,354 --> 00:37:19,878
You're not gonna tell anyone, are you?

365
00:37:22,095 --> 00:37:24,780
Why would I tell?
I'm gonna help you guys.

366
00:37:25,716 --> 00:37:26,862
- Really?
- Yeah.

367
00:37:26,931 --> 00:37:29,322
I love dogs, and there's a lot more
to taking care of them

368
00:37:29,399 --> 00:37:31,986
than throwing a stick and feeding them.

369
00:37:32,056 --> 00:37:33,618
You guys need me.

370
00:37:40,705 --> 00:37:42,199
I say she's in.

371
00:37:42,947 --> 00:37:45,568
Okay. I mean,
how much trouble can they be?

372
00:37:56,849 --> 00:37:58,311
Come on, guys.

373
00:38:02,645 --> 00:38:05,943
Do you really think we can do this,
like, every day?

374
00:38:06,009 --> 00:38:08,628
Yeah, why not? This is a piece of cake.

375
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:24,005
- Guys, come back! Come back!
- Guys, stop. Stop, stop, stop.

376
00:38:24,074 --> 00:38:25,897
Treat! Who wants a treat?

377
00:38:25,963 --> 00:38:27,689
Friday, no! Where is Romeo?

378
00:38:27,758 --> 00:38:30,443
Okay, Heather, you go that way,
I'll go this way.

379
00:38:31,728 --> 00:38:33,673
Aren't we supposed
to be wearing them out?

380
00:38:33,746 --> 00:38:35,570
This is totally normal.

381
00:38:40,088 --> 00:38:43,474
- Oh, so you think this is funny?
- No, no, not at all.

382
00:38:43,548 --> 00:38:47,959
Actually, I was just about to thank you
for reminding me to watch where I...

383
00:38:49,216 --> 00:38:50,232
...step.

384
00:39:09,395 --> 00:39:11,983
You know, I think we might
be in a little over our heads.

385
00:39:12,054 --> 00:39:14,260
It's 4-6, we're outdogged.

386
00:39:20,382 --> 00:39:22,358
Guys, it's really not that bad.

387
00:39:22,432 --> 00:39:25,731
I mean, if you look at it,
dogs have three basic needs.

388
00:39:25,796 --> 00:39:29,375
That's eating, sleeping
and then peeing and pooping.

389
00:39:29,445 --> 00:39:33,192
- That's four.
- No, I think peeing and pooping's one.

390
00:39:33,258 --> 00:39:36,393
I've stepped in both,
and I'd have to disagree.

391
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:42,735
Look, guys, I'm serious.
I really think I can make this work.

392
00:39:43,188 --> 00:39:44,235
How?

393
00:40:26,843 --> 00:40:28,438
What do you think?

394
00:40:41,387 --> 00:40:42,564
Thanks.

395
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:02,942
No, no, no, no. No.

396
00:41:20,527 --> 00:41:21,674
Ready?

397
00:42:44,093 --> 00:42:45,370
That's disgusting.

398
00:42:45,438 --> 00:42:48,475
That has to be the grossest thing
I've ever seen.

399
00:42:48,897 --> 00:42:50,360
That's awesome.

400
00:42:53,478 --> 00:42:57,409
We just wandered in here.
I'm not really sure what that thing was.

401
00:43:02,541 --> 00:43:05,129
Don't worry. I'm not gonna tell anyone.

402
00:43:05,456 --> 00:43:08,526
In fact, if you let me,
I'd love to help you guys.

403
00:43:09,044 --> 00:43:12,724
I just work down the street, you know,
I could keep an eye on the fuzz,

404
00:43:12,792 --> 00:43:16,821
could run interference,
massage your shoulders.

405
00:43:16,892 --> 00:43:19,512
- Okay, easy there, tiger.
- Yeah.

406
00:43:19,581 --> 00:43:22,813
Thanks for the offer,
but I think we got it under control.

407
00:43:22,881 --> 00:43:24,989
Could I have a word with you?

408
00:43:30,408 --> 00:43:32,712
All right. I've got to be honest.

409
00:43:33,324 --> 00:43:36,107
I'm at a critical point
in my social development

410
00:43:36,172 --> 00:43:39,275
and those are two fine-Iooking,
hot women you have behind you,

411
00:43:39,345 --> 00:43:42,130
and let's face it,
you can't date them both.

412
00:43:43,638 --> 00:43:45,679
So, who do you have dibs on?

413
00:43:46,039 --> 00:43:49,818
Dibs? I don't have dibs, per se.

414
00:43:50,395 --> 00:43:51,541
Gotcha.

415
00:43:55,615 --> 00:43:56,959
Name's Mark.

416
00:43:57,698 --> 00:44:00,634
Hi, Mark. You're on poop duty.

417
00:44:00,707 --> 00:44:05,120
Okay. So, how many dogs
are we talking here?

418
00:44:05,192 --> 00:44:06,754
- Just six.
- Seven.

419
00:44:10,317 --> 00:44:11,944
What is that?

420
00:44:13,967 --> 00:44:16,907
Actually, this is the newest member
of our family.

421
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:18,256
This is Henry.

422
00:44:18,324 --> 00:44:21,012
The poor guy was scrounging for food
in the junkyard.

423
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:22,804
- Bruce, that...
- Andi.

424
00:44:22,873 --> 00:44:25,297
Honestly, we have enough room.
We could take one more.

425
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:28,124
One more? We can fit, like, 10 more.
Think about that.

426
00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:29,620
Oh, yeah,
why don't we just wander the streets

427
00:44:29,696 --> 00:44:31,837
and rescue every stray we see?

428
00:44:35,941 --> 00:44:37,404
That was funny.

429
00:44:40,394 --> 00:44:42,948
Dispatch to 22. We have a stray
on Saint Andrews and Sixth.

430
00:44:43,019 --> 00:44:44,909
Saint Andrews and Sixth.

431
00:44:47,632 --> 00:44:50,416
Okay, guys, we've got a stray
on Saint Andrews and Sixth.

432
00:44:50,482 --> 00:44:52,689
That's Saint Andrews and Sixth.

433
00:44:53,879 --> 00:44:56,302
It's right near the pound, so hurry.

434
00:45:04,833 --> 00:45:08,545
Hello? Hi. Sorry to bother you.

435
00:45:08,612 --> 00:45:10,403
We were wondering
if we could have a minute of your time.

436
00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:12,610
- Not interested.
- We work for the school newspaper

437
00:45:12,679 --> 00:45:14,569
and we would love an interview.

438
00:45:14,634 --> 00:45:16,326
All right. You know what?
I don't have time for this.

439
00:45:16,396 --> 00:45:18,765
You guys just get out of here.
Skedaddle and play somewhere else.

440
00:45:18,830 --> 00:45:19,879
Okay.

441
00:45:23,441 --> 00:45:24,424
What's the matter?

442
00:45:24,498 --> 00:45:27,218
Never seen a husky kid
in a hoodie before?

443
00:45:28,375 --> 00:45:31,793
All right, guys,
get over to the old railroad depot ASAP.

444
00:45:33,018 --> 00:45:34,930
Over there. That's them.

445
00:45:38,177 --> 00:45:41,409
- He's stuck.
- Is she hurt?

446
00:45:44,870 --> 00:45:48,353
That's so sweet. They stayed together.
You okay?

447
00:45:48,424 --> 00:45:50,499
You're safe now.
We're gonna take care of you guys.

448
00:45:50,570 --> 00:45:51,946
Give me paw.

449
00:45:55,151 --> 00:45:57,257
There's that white one again.

450
00:45:57,905 --> 00:45:59,368
Let's get him.

451
00:46:00,051 --> 00:46:02,924
Here, doggy. Here, doggy.

452
00:46:05,144 --> 00:46:08,115
All right, come on, guys.
You're being rescued.

453
00:46:08,797 --> 00:46:11,384
Here, dog.
Hey, come back here, you mangy mutt.

454
00:46:11,454 --> 00:46:13,147
Hey! Come back here.

455
00:46:16,034 --> 00:46:19,137
All right, come on! Come on, everybody.

456
00:46:19,591 --> 00:46:21,697
Come on. Come on. Come on.

457
00:46:22,152 --> 00:46:25,833
- Head to tail. Head to tail. Come on.
- Come on. Get across, guys.

458
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:27,243
Go, go, go!

459
00:46:29,007 --> 00:46:32,174
Come on, trust it.
You can do it. Come on. Come on.

460
00:46:36,278 --> 00:46:37,262
Good boy.

461
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:38,283
Passengers loaded.

462
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:40,336
- Heading back to base.
- Copy that.

463
00:47:17,278 --> 00:47:19,831
- One, two, three, go!
- Okay. Okay. Go!

464
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:21,849
- Wait!
- Oh, what's that?

465
00:47:21,921 --> 00:47:23,866
Hey, what is this? What's going on?

466
00:47:23,939 --> 00:47:26,496
- Thumb war.
- Thumb war? Any calls?

467
00:47:27,846 --> 00:47:29,058
Nothing.

468
00:47:34,062 --> 00:47:35,689
Where are all the dogs?

469
00:47:57,570 --> 00:48:01,697
Thank you for riding the simulator.
Please exit for the next customer.

470
00:48:03,816 --> 00:48:04,864
Out!

471
00:48:06,794 --> 00:48:07,875
Next.

472
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:15,730
And please keep your paws
inside the vehicle at all times.

473
00:49:15,499 --> 00:49:19,213
Come on. Come on. Come on.

474
00:49:19,696 --> 00:49:22,415
There's gotta be something
you like to do.

475
00:49:43,366 --> 00:49:45,308
Go get her. Go get her.

476
00:50:59,981 --> 00:51:01,227
I'll get it.

477
00:51:05,555 --> 00:51:06,963
- Bernie.
- Oh, hey, Bernie.

478
00:51:07,028 --> 00:51:08,752
Excellent. Bernie.

479
00:51:08,821 --> 00:51:11,345
Carl, Lois, I'm gonna borrow the kids
for a second, is that okay?

480
00:51:11,417 --> 00:51:14,713
I don't know if you heard, but Lois and I
got a gig this weekend. Paid.

481
00:51:14,777 --> 00:51:16,208
Wow. Really?

482
00:51:16,284 --> 00:51:19,255
I'm gonna RSVP you and the missus
as a yes, right?

483
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:22,363
I'm not sure that I'm actually gonna
be able to make it.

484
00:51:22,434 --> 00:51:24,509
What about that friend of yours
that owns the club?

485
00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:25,759
Oh, yeah, he's definitely gonna be there.

486
00:51:25,829 --> 00:51:27,424
Yeah? Excellent.

487
00:51:29,672 --> 00:51:31,299
- I told you.
- Yeah.

488
00:51:32,234 --> 00:51:35,053
- So what is this emergency?
- Who cares? At least we're out of there.

489
00:51:35,118 --> 00:51:36,612
They were about to start band practice.

490
00:51:36,686 --> 00:51:37,998
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey, Jason.

491
00:51:38,065 --> 00:51:42,258
Hey, guys, I think I may have found
the perfect foster parents for you.

492
00:51:43,447 --> 00:51:44,940
- Perfect?
- They're perfect.

493
00:51:45,014 --> 00:51:47,056
They had two foster kids
that just went off to college

494
00:51:47,130 --> 00:51:48,341
and they're looking for two more,

495
00:51:48,410 --> 00:51:50,800
and I think
you guys are really gonna love them.

496
00:51:50,876 --> 00:51:54,809
So that's it, no more Carl and Lois.
You guys get packed, you're out of here.

497
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:56,288
Thank you, Bernie. Thank you.

498
00:51:56,353 --> 00:51:58,427
Best part about it is
it's only three hours away.

499
00:51:58,499 --> 00:52:00,128
You guys are free.

500
00:52:02,630 --> 00:52:04,575
- What?
- That far?

501
00:52:07,341 --> 00:52:09,448
Yes. What's the problem?

502
00:52:11,087 --> 00:52:15,402
- Well, we really like the area.
- We've made a lot of great friends.

503
00:52:15,475 --> 00:52:19,789
Yeah, and you know, Carl and Lois'
singing really grows on you.

504
00:52:20,792 --> 00:52:22,649
You hate Carl and Lois.

505
00:52:24,412 --> 00:52:26,201
Guys, what's going on?

506
00:52:27,294 --> 00:52:29,500
I mean, they want to make you
a part of their family.

507
00:52:29,568 --> 00:52:32,736
Look, we appreciate
everything you've done, but...

508
00:52:35,335 --> 00:52:38,120
Guys, you're not gonna get
another chance like this.

509
00:52:38,185 --> 00:52:40,325
I really think you should go.

510
00:52:42,926 --> 00:52:44,520
We'd like to stay.

511
00:52:46,545 --> 00:52:51,918
Well, I...
I have no idea what you guys are doing.

512
00:52:54,455 --> 00:52:56,117
We're really sorry.

513
00:53:16,363 --> 00:53:19,301
We're doing the right thing,
aren't we, Friday?

514
00:53:25,588 --> 00:53:27,534
Hey. What's up, puppy.

515
00:53:30,393 --> 00:53:31,825
Is everything okay?

516
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:35,164
Yeah, yeah, just... Just looking.

517
00:53:35,230 --> 00:53:37,621
- You come up here a lot, huh?
- Yeah.

518
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:40,800
I'm just guessing this is the kind of view
I wouldn't be able to afford

519
00:53:40,868 --> 00:53:43,106
if this place were a real hotel.

520
00:53:44,519 --> 00:53:48,746
So, what are you doing tomorrow night?

521
00:53:50,925 --> 00:53:54,124
Sneaking out,
serving 60 pounds of kibble,

522
00:53:54,191 --> 00:53:56,364
maybe mopping up some drool.

523
00:53:56,433 --> 00:53:59,219
'Cause a friend of mine
is having this party

524
00:53:59,285 --> 00:54:02,967
and you could come and meet some
people you'll be going to school with.

525
00:54:03,033 --> 00:54:05,621
The keyword here really being "people."

526
00:54:07,708 --> 00:54:09,020
Good point.

527
00:54:10,048 --> 00:54:12,865
Great. So, where should I pick you up?

528
00:54:14,979 --> 00:54:18,278
Why don't you just tell me where it is?
I can meet you there.

529
00:54:18,343 --> 00:54:19,621
All right.

530
00:54:29,170 --> 00:54:30,599
That's dinner.

531
00:55:00,334 --> 00:55:03,085
- Hey, guys.
- You guys ready for dinner?

532
00:55:05,587 --> 00:55:07,411
Are you hungry, buddy?

533
00:55:12,506 --> 00:55:13,935
Smells great.

534
00:55:14,459 --> 00:55:16,664
- Oh, thank you.
- You're welcome.

535
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:20,344
Thanks.

536
00:55:53,377 --> 00:55:54,523
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

537
00:55:54,594 --> 00:55:58,426
So, Heather,
it's kind of like a dinner date, isn't it?

538
00:56:07,886 --> 00:56:10,440
To us. To a real family.

539
00:56:12,305 --> 00:56:13,966
- To us.
- To us.

540
00:56:14,036 --> 00:56:15,597
- Cheers!
- To us.

541
00:56:15,669 --> 00:56:16,979
Let's eat.

542
00:56:30,402 --> 00:56:33,667
If cartoon birds and mice were ever
going to make me a dress for the ball,

543
00:56:33,734 --> 00:56:35,644
now would be a good time.

544
00:56:39,818 --> 00:56:44,132
- How long are you gonna be gone?
- A few hours, maybe. It's just a party.

545
00:56:46,288 --> 00:56:48,330
What if anything goes wrong?

546
00:56:48,755 --> 00:56:50,383
Bruce, you can handle it.
You can handle anything.

547
00:56:50,453 --> 00:56:52,943
I mean, have you stopped
and looked around the hotel?

548
00:56:53,015 --> 00:56:54,226
I could disappear for a week

549
00:56:54,297 --> 00:56:56,306
and you'd be able
to keep everything running.

550
00:56:56,379 --> 00:56:59,611
Yeah, but you're not gonna
disappear for a week, right?

551
00:56:59,679 --> 00:57:01,020
Of course not.

552
00:57:01,086 --> 00:57:04,352
Now, if you could just build me a dress,
then you'd be a real wizard.

553
00:57:04,418 --> 00:57:06,558
You should check out room 502.

554
00:57:57,460 --> 00:58:01,871
You look... Wow, you...
You look gorgeous.

555
00:58:01,943 --> 00:58:03,701
What, this old thing?

556
00:58:05,179 --> 00:58:07,416
Here, come on in.
Let me show you around.

557
00:58:09,215 --> 00:58:12,252
No! No, Lois!
That's my personal, that's...

558
00:58:17,735 --> 00:58:21,316
- So what else have you stolen?
- Nothing.

559
00:58:21,386 --> 00:58:25,318
- So you admit you did steal it.
- Never said that, Lois.

560
00:58:25,390 --> 00:58:27,398
You might as well tell the truth.

561
00:58:27,472 --> 00:58:30,158
Do you really think
you could outsmart us?

562
00:58:31,251 --> 00:58:33,675
I'd rather not answer that question, Carl.

563
00:58:36,472 --> 00:58:39,344
- I love your dress.
- Thanks.

564
00:58:39,418 --> 00:58:40,946
Marianne, this is Andi.

565
00:58:41,021 --> 00:58:43,608
She's gonna be going to school
with us next year.

566
00:58:43,679 --> 00:58:45,590
- Nice to meet you.
- Andi.

567
00:58:50,245 --> 00:58:51,326
- Hey, Jason.
- Hey.

568
00:58:51,398 --> 00:58:52,544
- How you doing?
- All right.

569
00:58:52,614 --> 00:58:56,197
- You guys already know each other?
- Yeah, it's Andi, right?

570
00:58:56,715 --> 00:58:58,144
Do I know you from somewhere?

571
00:58:58,220 --> 00:59:01,322
Yeah, you live in my grandmother's
building with the Scudders.

572
00:59:01,391 --> 00:59:04,908
No, I'm over on Oak.
I have one of those faces, though.

573
00:59:04,978 --> 00:59:07,283
No, you live with the Scudders.

574
00:59:07,350 --> 00:59:09,806
Come on, help me out here,
I'm not crazy.

575
00:59:09,879 --> 00:59:14,007
They're your foster parents,
you and your little brother... Barry.

576
00:59:14,075 --> 00:59:17,275
- Bruce?
- Bruce, Bruce, Bruce. That's it, Bruce.

577
00:59:18,591 --> 00:59:20,798
Andi, what is he talking about?

578
00:59:22,914 --> 00:59:24,827
Oh, my God, you guys, it's no big deal.

579
00:59:24,902 --> 00:59:28,167
So I guess the Scudders have been
foster parents before, big deal.

580
00:59:28,233 --> 00:59:30,023
They're also our aunt and uncle.

581
00:59:30,090 --> 00:59:33,869
We're just staying with them
while our parents are traveling in China,

582
00:59:33,934 --> 00:59:36,325
and we just call them our parents
because it is easier

583
00:59:36,401 --> 00:59:39,700
than talking about
this whole long boring story, okay?

584
00:59:40,758 --> 00:59:42,701
I'm thirsty, anyone else?

585
00:59:44,345 --> 00:59:45,523
Anyone?

586
00:59:52,351 --> 00:59:53,629
Andi, I...

587
00:59:56,356 --> 00:59:57,437
Andi!

588
01:01:14,828 --> 01:01:16,969
- Did you get a hold of Bernie yet?
- I'm on hold!

589
01:01:17,039 --> 01:01:20,009
Well, tell them it's an emergency.
Tell them I'm being stolen from.

590
01:01:20,082 --> 01:01:22,932
Tell who? I'm on hold!

591
01:01:25,558 --> 01:01:27,699
Don't think this means that...

592
01:01:30,653 --> 01:01:31,635
You let him get away!

593
01:02:34,134 --> 01:02:35,313
Friday?

594
01:02:52,328 --> 01:02:54,273
- Hurry up!
- I'm wearing heels!

595
01:02:54,347 --> 01:02:55,810
Well, so am I!

596
01:02:58,285 --> 01:03:02,545
- I can't believe they own a hotel.
- Oh, God, Carl, you're such an idiot!

597
01:03:10,426 --> 01:03:12,282
Stay close to me, baby.

598
01:03:16,670 --> 01:03:18,134
What was that?

599
01:03:22,692 --> 01:03:24,253
Don't answer it.

600
01:03:30,699 --> 01:03:34,828
Hey, that's my wah-wah pedal.
No wonder my sound's been off.

601
01:03:34,896 --> 01:03:36,459
Yeah, that's why.

602
01:03:37,202 --> 01:03:38,731
This crap is amazing.

603
01:03:38,804 --> 01:03:42,190
Yeah, 'cause it's our crap.
They've been robbing us blind.

604
01:03:43,576 --> 01:03:48,282
Good girl. Drop it! Georgia, drop it!

605
01:03:48,348 --> 01:03:50,554
- Bruce, Bruce!
- Let go. Georgia, let go of it!

606
01:03:50,622 --> 01:03:52,534
- Drop it, please!
- Bruce!

607
01:03:54,336 --> 01:03:55,767
What happened?

608
01:03:56,675 --> 01:03:57,986
Don't ask.

609
01:03:59,399 --> 01:04:01,222
What happened with you?

610
01:04:13,972 --> 01:04:15,118
Oh, no!

611
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:28,993
- Let's get out of here. Where's the exit?
- Like I left bread crumbs.

612
01:04:29,636 --> 01:04:31,360
Quick, guys, go, go!

613
01:04:35,945 --> 01:04:38,565
- Put the lights back on!
- I didn't do it!

614
01:04:43,056 --> 01:04:44,485
What is that?

615
01:04:47,348 --> 01:04:50,733
- I don't know. Let's get out of here!
- Oh, God! Shut it!

616
01:05:03,299 --> 01:05:05,822
Are you sure they said
it was coming from here?

617
01:05:05,894 --> 01:05:07,237
Don't know.

618
01:05:08,968 --> 01:05:10,693
Let's check upstairs.

619
01:05:13,774 --> 01:05:16,328
- Did you hear the cops?
- I don't know.

620
01:05:16,879 --> 01:05:18,125
Oh, good.

621
01:05:19,826 --> 01:05:21,257
Well, if those were cops,

622
01:05:21,332 --> 01:05:24,598
we're gonna turn them in ourselves,
'cause I smell reward.

623
01:05:24,664 --> 01:05:27,218
I don't think that's reward you smell.

624
01:05:36,191 --> 01:05:37,602
Where are we?

625
01:05:38,434 --> 01:05:40,259
We're in deep doo-doo.

626
01:05:49,583 --> 01:05:51,788
Okay. Stop breathing like that.

627
01:06:01,530 --> 01:06:03,025
No. No.

628
01:06:06,558 --> 01:06:07,572
- No.
- Don't.

629
01:06:31,670 --> 01:06:33,264
Get them in there.

630
01:06:42,527 --> 01:06:47,715
No! What are you doing? Friday!
You can't do this! No! Friday!

631
01:06:47,781 --> 01:06:49,342
- Bruce!
- Friday!

632
01:06:51,015 --> 01:06:54,280
Friday! Let go of me! That's my dog!

633
01:06:54,347 --> 01:06:55,842
Bruce! Just go!

634
01:07:35,890 --> 01:07:37,168
It's okay.

635
01:07:40,757 --> 01:07:42,647
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

636
01:07:46,203 --> 01:07:49,818
- We're in a lot of trouble, aren't we?
- Yeah.

637
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:55,582
But Bernie's doing
everything he can to help. Okay?

638
01:07:57,126 --> 01:07:59,300
Look, is there any way
that they could just stay with you

639
01:07:59,368 --> 01:08:01,704
for a little while longer
until I can find a family that'll take them?

640
01:08:01,770 --> 01:08:05,964
Not a chance. God knows
how much they've stolen from us.

641
01:08:06,030 --> 01:08:09,928
We have a lot of very rare
and valuable items in our home, okay?

642
01:08:10,001 --> 01:08:12,753
And we are gonna go
and do a full inventory

643
01:08:12,820 --> 01:08:16,435
and we're letting you know, all right?
This is an outrage. An outrage!

644
01:08:16,503 --> 01:08:20,085
I'm suing you. I'm suing those kids.
I'm suing the state.

645
01:08:20,667 --> 01:08:22,392
I'm suing the guy
that invented shrink wrap.

646
01:08:22,461 --> 01:08:24,121
I'm suing everyone!

647
01:08:27,427 --> 01:08:32,449
So you're gonna send us
to that other house now, right?

648
01:08:32,518 --> 01:08:34,081
That nice couple?

649
01:08:35,306 --> 01:08:37,893
- Bruce...
- Bruce, we're gonna be fine.

650
01:08:37,964 --> 01:08:40,299
I'll take care of it. Don't worry.

651
01:08:42,031 --> 01:08:45,744
Come on, Bernie.
You have to help us, please.

652
01:08:46,099 --> 01:08:48,240
Bruce needs me.
He's gonna get chewed up out there.

653
01:08:48,310 --> 01:08:51,510
Andi, I'm sorry, okay?
There's nothing I can do about it.

654
01:08:51,577 --> 01:08:53,006
You can't separate us, okay?

655
01:08:53,081 --> 01:08:56,019
Don't punish him
just because I screwed things up.

656
01:08:56,093 --> 01:08:58,430
Listen, the best thing you can do
for Bruce right now

657
01:08:58,495 --> 01:09:00,636
is let him have a fresh start.

658
01:09:01,762 --> 01:09:03,040
I'm sorry.

659
01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:06,722
Can't I just say one thing to my sister?

660
01:09:17,584 --> 01:09:23,307
Look, Andi, don't worry about me, okay?
I'm gonna be fine.

661
01:09:23,381 --> 01:09:27,443
I was supposed to keep us together.
I was supposed to protect us.

662
01:09:27,514 --> 01:09:29,818
Andi, we had to protect the dogs.

663
01:09:31,036 --> 01:09:34,521
If I had to do it over again,
I'd do the exact same thing.

664
01:10:29,524 --> 01:10:31,468
First come, first served!

665
01:10:48,902 --> 01:10:51,622
- Tomorrow morning for all of them.
- Yep.

666
01:10:59,856 --> 01:11:02,893
- We're gonna be busy.
- I can use the overtime.

667
01:12:17,210 --> 01:12:19,034
And which one are you?

668
01:12:19,100 --> 01:12:22,779
They must have left you behind.
You're the lucky one.

669
01:12:22,846 --> 01:12:24,441
Come here, buddy.

670
01:13:21,493 --> 01:13:26,102
I know how to sit,
how to fetch and how to roll over.

671
01:13:28,091 --> 01:13:31,193
What I don't know
is how I ended up in here.

672
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:34,718
Could you please turn that off?

673
01:13:39,398 --> 01:13:41,572
- Please.
- I did turn it off.

674
01:14:07,776 --> 01:14:08,825
Hey!

675
01:14:32,569 --> 01:14:35,121
- You busy?
- Friday!

676
01:14:38,910 --> 01:14:41,147
Oh, good boy. Good boy.

677
01:14:41,215 --> 01:14:42,264
So what's the plan?

678
01:14:42,337 --> 01:14:45,504
The dogs have less than a day left.
We've got to get them out of there now.

679
01:14:45,572 --> 01:14:47,779
Okay, that's really
more a goal than a plan.

680
01:14:47,847 --> 01:14:49,669
There's a no-kill shelter outside the city,

681
01:14:49,735 --> 01:14:51,776
so if we can get them out of the pound
and over the county line,

682
01:14:51,849 --> 01:14:53,442
then they're home free.

683
01:14:53,514 --> 01:14:55,240
- Right.
- But we gotta move quick.

684
01:14:55,309 --> 01:14:57,319
Andi, what happens to us?

685
01:14:58,927 --> 01:15:00,271
It's...

686
01:15:01,556 --> 01:15:03,924
Look, Bruce, it's not gonna be good.

687
01:15:03,989 --> 01:15:07,340
We're gonna be in more trouble
than we've ever been in.

688
01:15:09,947 --> 01:15:12,406
But we're gonna save the dogs.

689
01:15:12,478 --> 01:15:14,999
It's what we're supposed to do, right?

690
01:15:15,808 --> 01:15:17,118
Okay, guys.

691
01:15:18,306 --> 01:15:22,368
Okay, so here's the pound,
and this is the county line,

692
01:15:22,438 --> 01:15:23,901
and this is what we're gonna do.

693
01:15:30,893 --> 01:15:32,324
Are we ready?

694
01:15:34,385 --> 01:15:35,816
Let's do this!

695
01:15:36,916 --> 01:15:38,293
Got sausage.

696
01:15:38,359 --> 01:15:42,900
Fire! Fire! Fire! Hello?

697
01:15:42,969 --> 01:15:45,077
When a young girl is screaming for help
and yelling, "Fire,"

698
01:15:45,148 --> 01:15:46,611
- you're supposed to get moving!
- I have water.

699
01:15:46,686 --> 01:15:48,923
Fire! Hello?

700
01:15:50,146 --> 01:15:52,351
- Where?
- And they say chivalry is dead.

701
01:15:52,419 --> 01:15:54,243
It's right over there.

702
01:15:58,055 --> 01:15:59,103
Hey!

703
01:16:02,029 --> 01:16:04,169
A bunch of kids eager to adopt, I bet.

704
01:16:04,238 --> 01:16:06,694
- Where are the keys?
- There!

705
01:16:10,036 --> 01:16:11,631
You didn't think we'd forget you,
did you?

706
01:16:11,702 --> 01:16:13,743
Come on! Let's go. Come on.

707
01:16:15,129 --> 01:16:17,619
I missed you guys, too.
Come on. Let's go! Come on!

708
01:16:17,691 --> 01:16:20,562
Let's go, Shep! Come on, let's go!

709
01:16:20,636 --> 01:16:24,764
- Let's go for a run, you guys, come on!
- Go, go, go!

710
01:16:32,904 --> 01:16:34,082
Checking out.

711
01:16:34,153 --> 01:16:35,530
We're gonna get you guys out of here.
Come on.

712
01:16:35,595 --> 01:16:37,538
Hurry up, Thor, gotta go!

713
01:16:41,135 --> 01:16:42,794
Let's go, let's go!

714
01:16:44,051 --> 01:16:46,060
Way to go, Shep! Good girl.

715
01:16:46,421 --> 01:16:49,237
Okay, the coast is clear.
Bring her on back.

716
01:16:52,219 --> 01:16:54,260
What's going on here?

717
01:16:54,332 --> 01:16:57,117
I know you. All right, let's go.
You're going to jail.

718
01:16:57,182 --> 01:16:58,461
Trouble! Trouble!

719
01:16:58,529 --> 01:17:02,493
We can do this hard or we can do it
easy. Let's go, missy. Come on.

720
01:17:03,139 --> 01:17:05,150
Keep your paws off of her.

721
01:17:07,882 --> 01:17:11,234
Heather, save yourself!
Save yourself! Go! I have him!

722
01:17:16,274 --> 01:17:18,796
Nobody's going anywhere.

723
01:17:21,493 --> 01:17:23,318
Get back in there.

724
01:17:30,527 --> 01:17:31,738
Keys.

725
01:17:37,541 --> 01:17:38,556
Hey!

726
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:50,317
Okay, Friday,
you're gonna lead the pack.

727
01:17:51,154 --> 01:17:53,194
- Mark!
- Yes?

728
01:17:53,267 --> 01:17:55,157
Thank you!

729
01:17:55,222 --> 01:17:58,389
Come on, Friday. A little faster, buddy!
You can do it!

730
01:17:58,457 --> 01:18:01,427
Follow the sausage, Friday.
Follow the sausage!

731
01:18:04,094 --> 01:18:07,414
- Well, that went well.
- Yeah, well, we're not done yet.

732
01:18:15,624 --> 01:18:18,180
Come on, Friday, lead your pack!
Good boy!

733
01:18:18,251 --> 01:18:21,996
Come on, guys, follow the meat!
Come on! That's it, Friday, let's go.

734
01:18:46,693 --> 01:18:48,420
Oh, that's not good.

735
01:19:13,663 --> 01:19:14,744
Hey!

736
01:19:18,659 --> 01:19:22,494
- You guys, are we there yet?
- We're almost there, just up ahead.

737
01:19:33,073 --> 01:19:35,946
Wait. What? Oh, no!

738
01:19:40,921 --> 01:19:42,067
Friday!

739
01:19:44,156 --> 01:19:47,771
Guys, come back! This way!
Problem. They just went the other way.

740
01:19:47,839 --> 01:19:48,952
What?

741
01:19:54,727 --> 01:19:56,449
Where are they going?

742
01:19:59,241 --> 01:20:01,609
Home. They're going home.

743
01:20:44,597 --> 01:20:46,157
Block the exits.
Make sure they don't get back out.

744
01:20:46,228 --> 01:20:47,573
Let's get some more
Animal Control out here.

745
01:20:47,639 --> 01:20:49,582
- How much?
- All of it.

746
01:20:50,842 --> 01:20:55,418
We need all available Animal Control
units. All available Animal Control units.

747
01:21:13,968 --> 01:21:15,531
It is pure bedlam down here

748
01:21:15,602 --> 01:21:17,675
as authorities try
to take control of the situation.

749
01:21:17,749 --> 01:21:20,084
This scheme was supposedly
the work of several juvenile delinquents.

750
01:21:20,854 --> 01:21:22,830
Upstairs, right now, let's go!

751
01:21:22,903 --> 01:21:26,257
There's no need to get upset, Officer.
Animal Control is on the scene.

752
01:21:26,332 --> 01:21:28,121
All right, everybody,
if you can just let us do our job,

753
01:21:28,189 --> 01:21:29,979
we'll have all these
dangerous canines rounded up

754
01:21:30,047 --> 01:21:32,416
and out of your hair presently.

755
01:21:32,482 --> 01:21:33,693
- Stop!
- Can I get through here?

756
01:21:33,762 --> 01:21:35,138
- Watch out. Please?
- Excuse me, ma'am. Excuse me.

757
01:21:35,204 --> 01:21:36,732
Oh, no, no, no, no! Not you again!

758
01:21:36,805 --> 01:21:39,655
- Those dogs belong to us.
- They're family.

759
01:21:39,721 --> 01:21:41,632
Yeah, we're not gonna let you
coverall-wearing goons

760
01:21:41,706 --> 01:21:44,195
take them away from us.
And you can put that in your report.

761
01:21:44,268 --> 01:21:47,205
Officer, would you please arrest
these young felons right now

762
01:21:47,278 --> 01:21:49,998
- so we can get back to work?
- Fine! Just leave the dogs alone!

763
01:21:50,065 --> 01:21:52,238
Andi! There he is!

764
01:21:52,306 --> 01:21:53,901
That's our dog!
You can't just take him away!

765
01:21:53,972 --> 01:21:57,555
- Oh, what do we got here? A puppy!
- Just leave my dog alone!

766
01:21:59,290 --> 01:22:00,534
Stop!

767
01:22:06,079 --> 01:22:09,050
- Okay. Now, who are you?
- I'm Bernie Wilkins.

768
01:22:14,185 --> 01:22:15,712
Social Services.

769
01:22:16,587 --> 01:22:18,628
Okay, get them out of here!

770
01:22:20,526 --> 01:22:22,415
Come on, listen.
Can you just hear me out

771
01:22:22,479 --> 01:22:26,739
before you throw these kids in jail
and destroy all these innocent dogs?

772
01:22:31,159 --> 01:22:33,780
I see no reason
why we can't hear both sides.

773
01:22:33,850 --> 01:22:38,842
Look. I'm responsible for these kids,
and I know what they did was wrong.

774
01:22:40,385 --> 01:22:44,216
But I gotta tell you,
I wish I had the guts to do what they did.

775
01:22:46,342 --> 01:22:50,306
I've been trying to place kids
in good homes for 15 years

776
01:22:50,377 --> 01:22:52,616
and most of the time,
I'm not successful.

777
01:22:52,684 --> 01:22:55,370
But these kids,
they didn't make excuses.

778
01:22:55,438 --> 01:22:57,678
They didn't get frustrated
with the system and give up.

779
01:22:57,746 --> 01:23:00,944
They just went out and did it.
They saved everybody.

780
01:23:04,695 --> 01:23:06,736
They created their own little family.

781
01:23:06,809 --> 01:23:10,643
You call this a family? A bunch
of mangy strays in an old hotel?

782
01:23:18,564 --> 01:23:19,874
"Madison."

783
01:23:24,426 --> 01:23:25,637
Madison.

784
01:23:31,758 --> 01:23:32,939
Madison.

785
01:23:34,451 --> 01:23:36,275
"August 3rd,

786
01:23:36,341 --> 01:23:40,851
"found hiding in a backyard after the
family moved away and left her behind."

787
01:23:41,754 --> 01:23:44,407
Viola and Sebastian, the twins.

788
01:23:46,269 --> 01:23:48,094
"Together since they were puppies.

789
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:49,819
"Viola got snagged on a fence,

790
01:23:49,889 --> 01:23:53,024
"but Sebastian refused
to leave his sister behind."

791
01:23:53,605 --> 01:23:54,784
"Chelsea.

792
01:23:56,359 --> 01:23:58,850
"Chelsea lost her leg in an accident.

793
01:23:59,178 --> 01:24:02,313
"The owner didn't pay the bill
and abandoned her at the vet."

794
01:24:02,381 --> 01:24:05,898
"Coco, Rocky and Harley.

795
01:24:09,204 --> 01:24:12,077
"Found living together
in the woods near a dump."

796
01:24:12,151 --> 01:24:13,875
And there's many more.

797
01:24:13,943 --> 01:24:15,089
"Ginger.

798
01:24:16,346 --> 01:24:18,717
"Henry, Romeo, Juliet.

799
01:24:20,094 --> 01:24:21,304
"Cooper.

800
01:24:23,713 --> 01:24:24,860
"Shep.

801
01:24:26,757 --> 01:24:29,060
"George"? Does that say "George"?

802
01:24:29,895 --> 01:24:32,581
Georgia! Her name's Georgia.

803
01:24:33,002 --> 01:24:34,312
And Lenny.

804
01:24:38,574 --> 01:24:40,203
Georgia and Lenny.

805
01:24:42,835 --> 01:24:45,489
They're the first two residents
in this hotel.

806
01:24:45,558 --> 01:24:47,217
The Hotel for Dogs.

807
01:24:48,762 --> 01:24:51,699
No one was turned away
when they needed a home.

808
01:24:52,892 --> 01:24:56,245
Nobody was abandoned
when they were looking for a family.

809
01:24:56,320 --> 01:25:00,317
Are you really gonna tell me that
we're gonna just abandon them now?

810
01:25:12,238 --> 01:25:14,313
They don't look like
mangy strays, Officer.

811
01:25:14,385 --> 01:25:16,721
But you don't mind
if we take a look upstairs, do you?

812
01:25:16,787 --> 01:25:19,604
I think it's in the public's best interest.

813
01:25:22,102 --> 01:25:23,479
Be my guest.

814
01:25:52,852 --> 01:25:55,888
- You did great.
- You don't think I was too pushy?

815
01:25:56,729 --> 01:25:58,159
I like pushy.

816
01:26:10,373 --> 01:26:11,836
- Mark?
- Heather.

817
01:26:13,544 --> 01:26:16,230
So, is this when the hero gets the girl?

818
01:26:18,348 --> 01:26:19,659
Baby steps.

819
01:26:23,314 --> 01:26:25,006
Do you mind if I...

820
01:26:27,221 --> 01:26:29,525
No. Okay, sorry.

821
01:26:32,282 --> 01:26:35,318
You kids are heroes.
You should be proud.

822
01:26:35,388 --> 01:26:36,436
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

823
01:26:36,509 --> 01:26:38,551
Yeah, but the bad news is, in all this,

824
01:26:38,623 --> 01:26:43,002
I still haven't been able to find a foster
family that's willing to take you guys.

825
01:26:43,076 --> 01:26:45,411
That's okay, Bernie,
we know you tried your best.

826
01:26:45,478 --> 01:26:47,236
But the good news is,

827
01:26:47,304 --> 01:26:51,049
I have found some real parents
that might be willing to adopt.

828
01:26:52,845 --> 01:26:55,019
- Adopt?
- Yeah.

829
01:26:55,087 --> 01:26:56,366
See, the mom is excellent.

830
01:26:56,433 --> 01:26:58,673
She's a teacher,
so she's really great with kids.

831
01:26:58,740 --> 01:27:01,261
And he cannot cook to save his life.

832
01:27:01,332 --> 01:27:06,424
And he shouts during football games
like the players can actually hear him.

833
01:27:06,491 --> 01:27:08,400
But he has a great heart.

834
01:27:11,453 --> 01:27:12,917
Wait a minute.

835
01:27:14,528 --> 01:27:16,155
Do they like dogs?

836
01:27:17,507 --> 01:27:18,937
We love dogs.

837
01:27:42,619 --> 01:27:44,443
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

838
01:27:44,510 --> 01:27:47,415
I'd like to welcome you
to the Hotel for Dogs.

839
01:27:50,723 --> 01:27:53,376
Thanks to the generosity
of the entire city,

840
01:27:53,445 --> 01:27:57,061
we are now able to take care
of all your canine needs.

841
01:27:57,129 --> 01:27:58,788
Thank you, Georgia.

842
01:28:00,301 --> 01:28:03,052
Room 320 is now available.
