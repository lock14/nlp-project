1
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:47,525
I've always wondered,
when a butterfly leaves the
safety of its cocoon,

2
00:02:47,693 --> 00:02:50,695
does it realize how beautiful
it has become?

3
00:02:57,202 --> 00:03:00,621
Or does it still just see itself
as a caterpillar?

4
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:06,544
When I was a kid,
I knew the secret to a happy life.

5
00:03:07,045 --> 00:03:09,672
Play by the rules,
work hard in school,

6
00:03:11,174 --> 00:03:15,678
and if you work hard in school,
then your reward is more school.

7
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:19,348
And after more school,

8
00:03:19,516 --> 00:03:23,477
then you're given the best
that life has to offer,

9
00:03:24,396 --> 00:03:28,065
a job, and money, and a future,

10
00:03:29,026 --> 00:03:33,237
filled with the unending
singular pursuit of more.

11
00:03:36,033 --> 00:03:39,076
It's going up a quarter
of a point. Block it now.

12
00:03:43,665 --> 00:03:45,875
And this is what I was living for.

13
00:03:47,294 --> 00:03:51,130
My happy life.

14
00:03:58,472 --> 00:04:02,224
I envied those who
never questioned it. Me?

15
00:04:04,186 --> 00:04:06,228
I needed a way out.

16
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:27,458
- The usual.
- Sure.

17
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:29,961
I have ...

18
00:04:33,548 --> 00:04:36,092
Here's something that I was
hoping that you might ...

19
00:04:36,259 --> 00:04:38,844
You might take a little ...
A look at.

20
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:41,222
- Is there something the matter?
- No.

21
00:04:42,182 --> 00:04:44,058
Your track record is perfect.

22
00:04:44,518 --> 00:04:48,354
And with your stock market luck,

23
00:04:49,731 --> 00:04:51,565
we could ...  You could ...

24
00:04:53,068 --> 00:04:54,610
Maybe you should invest more.

25
00:04:54,778 --> 00:04:57,363
No. Small amounts.
Just keep it simple.

26
00:05:00,659 --> 00:05:04,161
It's just ...  You just ...

27
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:09,834
How do you do it?

28
00:05:11,294 --> 00:05:14,922
Sometimes risking everything
is the only choice you have.

29
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,177
But you don't seem to be
taking any sort of chance.

30
00:05:20,595 --> 00:05:22,680
I wasn't talking about me.

31
00:05:27,853 --> 00:05:29,895
I'm sorry. You're right.

32
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:31,689
This is none of my business.

33
00:05:31,857 --> 00:05:35,484
Please, don't concern yourself with me
piggy-backing on any of your stocks.

34
00:05:35,652 --> 00:05:36,944
I would never do that.

35
00:05:37,112 --> 00:05:38,446
I'm not worried.

36
00:05:38,697 --> 00:05:41,824
I know for a fact
that you would never do that.

37
00:07:02,489 --> 00:07:04,949
So, where does
change come from?

38
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:08,786
And how do we recognize it
when it happens?

39
00:07:09,246 --> 00:07:11,288
... and she's whining about it, saying,

40
00:07:11,456 --> 00:07:14,542
"No, please. It hurts."

41
00:07:14,709 --> 00:07:17,002
- Thanks for the tip. I owe you one.
- Yeah. Back-door girl.

42
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:20,422
All right. Hey, that was my cousin.

43
00:07:20,757 --> 00:07:23,384
We are on for tonight.
All right, now, listen up.

44
00:07:30,767 --> 00:07:33,227
All right. This place is
the real fucking deal.

45
00:07:33,395 --> 00:07:35,604
Back rooms and everything,
so do not fuck around.

46
00:07:35,772 --> 00:07:39,191
We go in, we make our bets,
we collect, we get the fuck out.

47
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:41,735
The fix is in,
he's got the winning horse's name.

48
00:07:41,903 --> 00:07:45,322
And get this, shitheads,
odds are eight to fucking one.

49
00:07:45,657 --> 00:07:47,116
- Yeah.
- It's a sure thing.

50
00:07:47,284 --> 00:07:49,660
All right,
we meet downstairs at 7:00.

51
00:07:49,828 --> 00:07:52,830
And keep your mouths fucking shut,
especially you, motherfucker.

52
00:07:52,998 --> 00:07:55,207
- Jeez.
- Don't worry. We're cool.

53
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:59,378
Hey! The winning horse?
What's the name?

54
00:08:00,172 --> 00:08:01,422
Get this.

55
00:08:02,382 --> 00:08:03,257
Butterfly.

56
00:09:16,498 --> 00:09:17,957
You want somethin'?

57
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:22,461
I want to put some money down
on Butterfly.

58
00:09:24,506 --> 00:09:25,923
In the next race.

59
00:09:26,549 --> 00:09:27,841
Can I use this?

60
00:09:28,551 --> 00:09:31,136
Sure. How much?

61
00:09:32,555 --> 00:09:33,555
10.

62
00:09:34,516 --> 00:09:37,685
$10,000, please.

63
00:09:42,274 --> 00:09:43,607
Wait.

64
00:09:44,901 --> 00:09:46,652
20. 20.

65
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:54,702
Maybe ... How about 50?

66
00:09:55,578 --> 00:09:58,330
You got that much scratch,
huh, mister?

67
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,291
No, 'cause if you don't,

68
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:03,294
you can always borrow something
from the house.

69
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,837
Thank you.

70
00:10:05,005 --> 00:10:08,090
I'm gonna have to see
your driver's license.

71
00:10:09,259 --> 00:10:12,469
Hey, Louie, file this, will you?

72
00:10:15,557 --> 00:10:19,143
Okay, 50 Gs on Butterfly.

73
00:10:29,237 --> 00:10:30,779
The horses are in the gate.

74
00:10:33,116 --> 00:10:34,033
And they're off!

75
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,452
Jello out in front by a half a length.

76
00:10:36,619 --> 00:10:41,165
Alpha and Santana right behind him,
followed by Shooting Star, Perpetrator,

77
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:43,375
Butterfly and Silky April.

78
00:10:43,543 --> 00:10:45,753
On the inside, Alpha making a move.

79
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,546
He's neck and neck with Jello.

80
00:10:47,714 --> 00:10:48,964
Wait! Here comes Butterfly

81
00:10:49,132 --> 00:10:50,341
- At a surprise dash.
- Come on, baby.

82
00:10:50,508 --> 00:10:53,218
This is unexpected!
He's passing Alpha.

83
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:55,763
Passing Jello.
Butterfly takes the lead!

84
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:58,515
- Around the turn they go.
It's Butterfly ...
- Yes!

85
00:10:58,683 --> 00:11:00,559
... followed by Alpha and Jello.

86
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:03,437
- Oh, my goodness! He's down!
- What the fuck?

87
00:11:03,605 --> 00:11:06,023
Butterfly has rolled,
and there goes Alpha with him!

88
00:11:06,191 --> 00:11:07,649
- What a terrible accident ...
- Fuck!

89
00:11:07,817 --> 00:11:08,984
... ladies and gentlemen!
- Fuck!

90
00:11:09,152 --> 00:11:12,988
And it's Jello across the finish line.
Jello wins.

91
00:11:27,712 --> 00:11:30,506
- What do you guys want me to do?
- Shut up!

92
00:11:48,525 --> 00:11:50,692
How did you find this place?

93
00:11:58,576 --> 00:12:02,913
How did you ...
I'm talking to you!
It's a simple fucking question!

94
00:12:03,873 --> 00:12:05,416
Okay, here we go.

95
00:12:14,384 --> 00:12:16,718
- Are you working for the cops?
- No.

96
00:12:16,886 --> 00:12:20,180
- I was just trying to gamble.
That's all.
- You wanted to gamble?

97
00:12:20,348 --> 00:12:23,267
Nobody comes to this place
because they feel like a
little gambling!

98
00:12:23,435 --> 00:12:26,019
Please, I'm sorry, Del.
I wasn't going to run.

99
00:12:26,187 --> 00:12:27,354
I was going to go ...

100
00:12:28,523 --> 00:12:29,648
Fuck.

101
00:12:31,109 --> 00:12:32,109
God damn.

102
00:12:36,656 --> 00:12:38,490
You bet on Butterfly.

103
00:12:39,367 --> 00:12:40,742
Yes, I did.

104
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,411
You knew about the fix.

105
00:12:42,579 --> 00:12:45,914
- No. I didn't ... I ...
- Look,

106
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:48,625
don't lie to me. How?

107
00:12:49,586 --> 00:12:53,755
Come on! Come on! Come on!
How did you know about the fix?

108
00:12:54,674 --> 00:12:58,552
I overheard my coworkers, and I ...

109
00:13:01,264 --> 00:13:02,723
I like butterflies.

110
00:13:05,185 --> 00:13:07,478
- You like what?
- Butterflies.

111
00:13:07,687 --> 00:13:10,522
- Butterflies.
- I like butterflies.

112
00:13:11,774 --> 00:13:15,694
He likes butterflies. The horse's
name is Butterfly,
so he comes here,

113
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:18,071
and he bets on a fix.

114
00:13:19,157 --> 00:13:21,575
- You know why they call me Fingers?
- No.

115
00:13:22,076 --> 00:13:24,953
Well, Mr. Parks here knows
why they call me Fingers.

116
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:28,624
Because two weeks ago,
he also came by because

117
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:30,292
he also felt like gambling.

118
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:31,502
Hey, I wasn't going to run.

119
00:13:31,669 --> 00:13:34,379
I was gonna get the money from my
sister! I was gonna go pick it up!

120
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:38,425
He lost. And instead of paying me
what he owes me,

121
00:13:38,927 --> 00:13:40,260
what does he do?

122
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:44,765
- He tries to run.
- I wasn't trying to run.

123
00:13:44,933 --> 00:13:46,850
I swear to God!

124
00:13:48,686 --> 00:13:50,145
What is it with you guys?

125
00:13:50,313 --> 00:13:52,648
You come here, you make a stupid
mistake, and now what?

126
00:13:52,815 --> 00:13:55,776
Now I got to be the bad guy?
Is that it? That my job?

127
00:13:56,528 --> 00:14:00,447
I can't enjoy the fucking opera?
I got to come here, and be a bad guy?

128
00:14:00,615 --> 00:14:02,282
You think I enjoy this?

129
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:05,410
- You think I enjoy this?
- I don't ... I don't ...
I don't know.

130
00:14:06,621 --> 00:14:10,332
Well, I don't enjoy it.
It's guys like you,

131
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,751
and you, Mr. Parks.

132
00:14:19,801 --> 00:14:21,843
You know, you just
leave me no choice.

133
00:14:22,011 --> 00:14:26,014
No. You do have a choice.
My sister has the money! I ...

134
00:14:26,182 --> 00:14:28,225
No! No!

135
00:14:29,644 --> 00:14:31,478
Fucking no!

136
00:14:33,022 --> 00:14:37,484
Oh, fuck! God! You son of a bitch!

137
00:14:42,323 --> 00:14:46,159
You got two weeks to pay
me the money. Each day
you're late, I cut a finger.

138
00:15:07,348 --> 00:15:09,182
Going somewhere?

139
00:15:11,769 --> 00:15:12,769
You.

140
00:15:14,147 --> 00:15:16,064
- But I ...
- You're packing.

141
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,151
No, I'm not.

142
00:15:19,819 --> 00:15:21,028
Sit down.

143
00:15:25,325 --> 00:15:27,993
You work for Fingers, don't you?

144
00:15:35,585 --> 00:15:38,003
You have a nice home.
A good job.

145
00:15:38,171 --> 00:15:42,215
You're good at it.
And you just threw it all away. Why?

146
00:15:43,259 --> 00:15:45,385
- Please, I don't know.
- Why did you do this?

147
00:15:46,888 --> 00:15:50,140
I don't know. I was stupid.
I wasn't thinking.

148
00:15:50,308 --> 00:15:52,392
- Why did you do this?
Why did you do this?
- Please.

149
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,602
Stop it!

150
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:57,773
- Why did you do this?
- I don't know!

151
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:01,485
- Yes, you do.
- No, I don't!

152
00:16:01,653 --> 00:16:03,945
- You do!
- No, I don't!

153
00:16:06,783 --> 00:16:09,076
- No!
- Tell me!

154
00:16:12,038 --> 00:16:14,706
I ... I ...

155
00:16:38,106 --> 00:16:39,439
Here, take it.

156
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,274
Go on.

157
00:16:50,493 --> 00:16:52,494
It's all I can give you.

158
00:16:53,329 --> 00:16:54,496
Wait.

159
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:59,084
What am I supposed to do with this?

160
00:17:01,212 --> 00:17:03,046
I don't know anymore.

161
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:19,020
Wait.

162
00:17:19,897 --> 00:17:20,814
Please.

163
00:17:20,982 --> 00:17:25,402
Sometimes, being totally fucked
can be a liberating experience.

164
00:17:27,321 --> 00:17:30,157
Today, I see things in a new light.

165
00:17:31,576 --> 00:17:34,327
I see the money move through this
place like it does every day.

166
00:17:34,495 --> 00:17:36,788
I see the cameras that will monitor
my every move.

167
00:17:36,956 --> 00:17:40,000
I see the panic button that the tellers
will push, alerting the police.

168
00:17:40,168 --> 00:17:41,042
And when that button's pushed,

169
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:44,087
I know that the police will arrive
no earlier than four minutes,

170
00:17:44,255 --> 00:17:45,172
which gives me plenty of time,

171
00:17:45,339 --> 00:17:47,507
assuming I've already planned
my escape route,

172
00:17:47,675 --> 00:17:48,800
which I have.

173
00:17:48,968 --> 00:17:53,305
And finally, I see a strap bag
with a lead-lined pouch, filled
with money.

174
00:17:53,473 --> 00:17:56,016
No one else will see it.
But I'll know it's there.

175
00:18:24,587 --> 00:18:27,047
Everybody, freeze.

176
00:18:31,886 --> 00:18:32,886
Freeze.

177
00:18:41,562 --> 00:18:43,313
Everybody, freeze!

178
00:19:06,796 --> 00:19:10,173
Dude, that was crazy.
Are you okay?

179
00:19:12,009 --> 00:19:13,718
Are you okay?

180
00:19:47,086 --> 00:19:49,254
Let's go!
Move, move, move!

181
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:54,569
This is the police.
You are surrounded.

182
00:20:54,737 --> 00:20:58,490
Do not attempt to run,
or make any sudden moves.

183
00:20:58,658 --> 00:21:01,242
Drop your weapon, raise your hands,

184
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:04,621
and walk forward to the south
end of the roof.

185
00:21:05,164 --> 00:21:07,791
Put the bag and the gun down!

186
00:21:07,959 --> 00:21:09,584
This is your last warning.

187
00:21:09,752 --> 00:21:12,837
Drop your weapon,
or you will be fired upon!

188
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:56,232
Call the ...
We need to get him on ...

189
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,070
Sir, sir, can you tell me
what happened to you?

190
00:23:00,237 --> 00:23:01,446
- I don't know.
- Sir,

191
00:23:01,614 --> 00:23:04,115
can you remember
what happened to you?

192
00:23:04,283 --> 00:23:07,077
I don't know. You tell me.

193
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:13,374
As far back as I can remember,
I've never lost a fight.

194
00:23:14,627 --> 00:23:18,004
- Come on, Markie, hurry up!
- I can't do it anymore!
Can't run anymore!

195
00:23:19,757 --> 00:23:22,926
I didn't fight well because I was
big or fast or mean.

196
00:23:24,345 --> 00:23:27,472
I fought well because
I could see the future.

197
00:23:28,307 --> 00:23:32,310
The problem with seeing the
future is that it only comes
in bits and pieces,

198
00:23:32,478 --> 00:23:35,480
like a reflection in a broken mirror.

199
00:23:44,406 --> 00:23:47,659
After a while, though,
it's like playing a
video game in your head.

200
00:23:47,827 --> 00:23:50,578
Do it enough times,
and you know all the moves.

201
00:23:54,291 --> 00:23:55,291
Look out!

202
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:09,139
But no matter what,
the future is written.

203
00:24:09,306 --> 00:24:10,974
Markie, say something, come on!

204
00:24:11,142 --> 00:24:12,058
I can't change that.

205
00:24:12,226 --> 00:24:16,229
Come on. Markie.
Markie! Markie! Markie!

206
00:24:18,482 --> 00:24:21,067
And sometimes,
the things you can't change,

207
00:24:21,527 --> 00:24:23,236
they end up changing you.

208
00:24:26,782 --> 00:24:28,783
Please, wait! Wait!

209
00:24:29,076 --> 00:24:31,619
Fingers, he'll listen to you.

210
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:33,872
Talk to him! Please?

211
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:37,792
I've seen what happens to you.
Nothing could change that.

212
00:24:38,502 --> 00:24:39,377
No!

213
00:24:42,673 --> 00:24:44,382
Please, no!

214
00:24:48,179 --> 00:24:49,470
- It's done.
- Good.

215
00:24:49,638 --> 00:24:51,181
I need you to pick somebody up
at the airport.

216
00:24:51,348 --> 00:24:52,473
I know.

217
00:24:55,769 --> 00:24:57,437
See, my dad's got business
locked tight back home,

218
00:24:57,605 --> 00:24:58,938
but you know, I want to see
the world, you know.

219
00:24:59,106 --> 00:25:02,859
And my Uncle Fingers, he's all
about family and sharing the
wealth, you know?

220
00:25:03,027 --> 00:25:04,402
You know how he got that
nickname, Fingers?

221
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:08,281
Because people do whatever he
wants, and all he has to do
is just snap his fingers.

222
00:25:08,449 --> 00:25:10,700
Man, that's a great
fucking nickname, man.

223
00:25:10,868 --> 00:25:14,037
Just fucking snap, and snap
his fucking fingers and shit, yeah.

224
00:25:14,205 --> 00:25:17,332
You know, seeing my uncle is
cool and all, but I'll tell you,
I came here for one thing,

225
00:25:17,499 --> 00:25:19,209
and one thing only. Pussy.

226
00:25:21,128 --> 00:25:25,381
You know what the fuck I'm saying?
I'm going to fuck tonight!

227
00:25:32,306 --> 00:25:37,185
Hey, hey, hey! I heard my
favorite uncle was
here, huh? Come on!

228
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:39,854
- How you doing?
- Good.

229
00:25:40,022 --> 00:25:42,607
- How are you, Tony?
Good to see you.
- Great to see you ...

230
00:25:42,775 --> 00:25:44,359
That's the boss's nephew.

231
00:25:44,526 --> 00:25:47,737
Nigga, what?
Look at this fucking thing.
This is huge!

232
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:49,072
What's he like?

233
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:52,242
- Fuck, I mean, this is just like ... Fuck.
- Articulate.

234
00:25:52,409 --> 00:25:53,743
My men taking good care of you?

235
00:25:53,911 --> 00:25:56,579
Oh, yeah, yeah.
We've been chatting it up.
We're going to check this town out.

236
00:25:56,747 --> 00:25:57,705
- Good.
- Yeah.

237
00:25:57,873 --> 00:26:00,667
- Young man's gotta change his oil.
- Yeah.

238
00:26:00,834 --> 00:26:02,168
Listen to me.

239
00:26:04,838 --> 00:26:07,966
Your dad wants me to pop your
cherry, show you the ropes.

240
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:09,968
Now, there's going to be plenty
of time for dick-waving,

241
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:12,220
but we need to make time for ...

242
00:26:14,848 --> 00:26:16,307
- Business.
- Exactly.

243
00:26:16,475 --> 00:26:19,477
No joking around. Okay. Good.

244
00:26:21,355 --> 00:26:22,730
You want to take Tony out
on your rounds tonight,

245
00:26:22,898 --> 00:26:24,399
show him the city, what we do?

246
00:26:24,566 --> 00:26:27,944
Start his education,
keep you company? Okay?

247
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:32,907
- Of course.
- All right, then.

248
00:26:33,284 --> 00:26:36,661
Keep your ass out of trouble.
Remember the last time.

249
00:26:36,829 --> 00:26:39,914
Yeah, yeah, hey, hey, no lingerie.
I swear.
I promise, huh?

250
00:26:40,082 --> 00:26:41,833
It's funny now, all right?

251
00:26:42,001 --> 00:26:45,753
Okay, go. Get out of here. Go outside.
I got some business to discuss.

252
00:26:45,921 --> 00:26:47,880
I'll see you later.

253
00:26:56,098 --> 00:26:58,308
Kid's a fucking mess.

254
00:26:58,475 --> 00:27:01,019
Just try to keep him out of trouble.
Maybe he'll learn a thing or two.

255
00:27:01,186 --> 00:27:02,437
But, now,

256
00:27:03,689 --> 00:27:05,315
it's time for business.

257
00:27:06,233 --> 00:27:07,859
Listen to this.

258
00:27:28,589 --> 00:27:31,299
- What do you think?
- It's fine.

259
00:27:32,426 --> 00:27:33,760
- Excuse me?
- It's fine.

260
00:27:33,927 --> 00:27:36,471
"It's fine." It's fucking great.
What are you talking about?

261
00:27:36,638 --> 00:27:38,598
I don't know much about music.

262
00:27:39,016 --> 00:27:41,601
A client of mine,
who paid his debt to me ...

263
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:44,103
Part of the deal
was her management contract.

264
00:27:44,271 --> 00:27:48,399
This is her first CD. The sales?
Through the roof. Very promising.

265
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:51,986
I'm sorry, I still don't follow you.

266
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,740
How long have we been doing this?

267
00:27:57,451 --> 00:28:00,036
Too long. I'm tired of chasing money.

268
00:28:00,537 --> 00:28:03,664
I'm tired of teaching lessons
to lowlifes who won't pay.

269
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:10,004
I've always hoped for more.

270
00:28:10,964 --> 00:28:12,298
For both of us.

271
00:28:16,136 --> 00:28:18,137
This girl's our way out.

272
00:28:18,555 --> 00:28:21,766
I'm sure she's going to be pissed off
when she finds out I'm her new manager,

273
00:28:21,934 --> 00:28:24,936
but I'll take care of that.
You just keep an eye on her.

274
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:26,229
Yeah.

275
00:28:29,608 --> 00:28:31,776
What is it? What do you see?

276
00:28:33,654 --> 00:28:34,862
Nothing.

277
00:28:36,198 --> 00:28:37,615
You see something.

278
00:28:38,158 --> 00:28:39,492
I don't see anything.

279
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:41,869
What do you mean? She has no future?

280
00:28:42,037 --> 00:28:43,621
No, she has a future.

281
00:28:44,623 --> 00:28:46,124
I just can't see it.

282
00:28:56,885 --> 00:28:59,095
You don't talk much, do you, huh?

283
00:29:00,764 --> 00:29:03,433
Busy thinking about the future,
I bet.

284
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,519
Yeah, my uncle fucking told me.
He said you can see the
future and shit.

285
00:29:06,687 --> 00:29:11,274
Says you're fucking money. Casinos,
stock market ...
He said you know it all.

286
00:29:11,608 --> 00:29:14,527
You know what it reminds me of?
You ever see that movie Krull?

287
00:29:14,695 --> 00:29:16,446
All right, there's this
fucking Cyclops in it,

288
00:29:16,613 --> 00:29:18,990
and the way that he got that way
was he traded one of his eyes

289
00:29:19,158 --> 00:29:20,032
to see the future.

290
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,493
Okay, but long story fucking
crazy short ...

291
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:36,132
... all ended up happening
was the evil warlord tricked
that fucker,

292
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:39,594
and the only future he could see
was his own death.

293
00:29:40,053 --> 00:29:42,221
Man, that shit would suck. Yeah.

294
00:29:43,265 --> 00:29:45,975
Fuck me.
So, what's the plan tonight, my man?

295
00:29:46,143 --> 00:29:49,061
Are we going to get
some fucking drinks first,

296
00:29:49,229 --> 00:29:50,980
or is it just

297
00:29:51,148 --> 00:29:53,149
- straight to the pussy?
- Tonight we work.

298
00:30:04,745 --> 00:30:07,246
He's not here.
Come back next week.

299
00:30:13,378 --> 00:30:16,631
He's in the hospital.
Getting a mole removed.

300
00:30:18,467 --> 00:30:20,259
Come back next week!

301
00:30:23,305 --> 00:30:26,098
- Hey! Stop!
- How do you like that, huh?

302
00:30:26,308 --> 00:30:27,975
Bet you don't! Yeah.

303
00:30:28,143 --> 00:30:30,603
I told you next week!

304
00:30:30,771 --> 00:30:34,023
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
You pay up now, old bag.

305
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,817
Otherwise, we're going to
fuck some more shit up, huh?

306
00:30:36,985 --> 00:30:39,695
Hey! Stop, little bastard! Come on!

307
00:30:55,337 --> 00:30:57,004
Dude! Dude!

308
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:02,093
Why didn't you help me out when
I was getting fucked by Moby
Dick in there, huh?

309
00:31:02,261 --> 00:31:03,761
Come on, what do you think?
You want me to go back?

310
00:31:03,929 --> 00:31:05,555
Stomp that bitch, man?
'Cause I'm a fucking savage,

311
00:31:05,722 --> 00:31:06,681
you know what I'm saying?

312
00:31:06,848 --> 00:31:08,933
Look at this fucking hat.

313
00:31:09,101 --> 00:31:11,018
Look at this shit, man.

314
00:31:27,828 --> 00:31:29,495
- Where's the money?
- Where's the fucking money, huh?

315
00:31:29,663 --> 00:31:30,830
I don't have it!

316
00:31:41,925 --> 00:31:44,176
- You bleeding?
- I don't know.

317
00:31:45,804 --> 00:31:47,054
Get up.

318
00:31:48,932 --> 00:31:52,893
I'm going to cut you a break.
I'm coming back next week, all right?

319
00:31:53,061 --> 00:31:56,022
I need you to get that money.
I want to make sure Fingers gets it.

320
00:31:56,189 --> 00:31:59,275
'Cause if he doesn't,
he's going to get one of these.

321
00:31:59,443 --> 00:32:00,359
Yeah?

322
00:32:00,527 --> 00:32:02,153
- You don't want that.
- No.

323
00:32:02,738 --> 00:32:04,572
- Okay? I'll see you next week.
- Yeah.

324
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:07,825
- Okay.
- All right? I'm sorry about the missus.

325
00:32:10,162 --> 00:32:11,162
Let's go.

326
00:32:12,372 --> 00:32:13,372
Dude!

327
00:32:28,138 --> 00:32:31,849
Man, I've never seen anything
like that, man. Fucking cold,
merciless shit back there.

328
00:32:32,017 --> 00:32:34,810
I mean, you knew that crazy bitch
was coming, didn't you? You ...

329
00:32:34,978 --> 00:32:37,730
What's it like?
I mean, what do you see?

330
00:32:39,232 --> 00:32:42,777
You enjoy this shit, man?
Fucking people up like that?

331
00:32:42,944 --> 00:32:44,403
Sometimes it's part of the job.

332
00:32:44,571 --> 00:32:46,864
Yeah, but do you enjoy it?

333
00:32:47,324 --> 00:32:51,160
'Cause you know what I think?
I think you do, man.
I think you love it.

334
00:32:51,328 --> 00:32:52,453
Yeah, you do, 'cause

335
00:32:52,621 --> 00:32:56,123
otherwise, you'd just predict
the lottery, and get the fuck
out of here, right?

336
00:32:56,291 --> 00:32:57,917
- Right, right?
- I can't.

337
00:32:58,794 --> 00:33:01,962
What do you mean you can't?
A man does anything he wants.

338
00:33:02,172 --> 00:33:03,547
I can't do that.

339
00:33:04,591 --> 00:33:06,759
I can't do that
because I haven't been shown.

340
00:33:06,927 --> 00:33:09,929
The moment I see it,
then I'll move on.

341
00:33:15,102 --> 00:33:16,727
So, you could, like ...

342
00:33:17,896 --> 00:33:20,856
You could, like, fuck any girl,
and know you ain't getting the clap

343
00:33:21,024 --> 00:33:22,525
for sure, sure, huh?

344
00:33:24,695 --> 00:33:28,614
I mean, safe sex is a beautiful thing.
So I've heard.

345
00:33:57,602 --> 00:34:00,396
Dude, this is just what my
dream house looks like. I want
a place just like this,

346
00:34:00,564 --> 00:34:02,356
with chicks, and music,
and chicks fucking each other,

347
00:34:02,524 --> 00:34:04,316
while some midget chick
sucks my balls.

348
00:34:04,484 --> 00:34:06,819
Why didn't we come here first?

349
00:34:09,906 --> 00:34:11,407
Lot of ass for an old guy.

350
00:34:11,575 --> 00:34:12,992
Hello, boys.

351
00:34:14,327 --> 00:34:17,580
It's a pleasure to see you.
As always.

352
00:34:17,748 --> 00:34:21,083
Jiyoung, this is Tony,
Fingers' nephew.

353
00:34:21,251 --> 00:34:22,251
Oh!

354
00:34:22,961 --> 00:34:24,086
Hi, how you doing?

355
00:34:24,254 --> 00:34:28,507
Hi. I love your uncle. He's
such a sweet man. Have you
had something to drink?

356
00:34:28,675 --> 00:34:32,470
No, I'm actually on a bit of a
schedule right now, but you know ...

357
00:34:32,637 --> 00:34:34,889
- We got a room or ...
- We don't have time to stay.

358
00:34:35,056 --> 00:34:37,725
You always say that,
but I know it's not true.

359
00:34:39,186 --> 00:34:41,020
Whatever you want, just ask.

360
00:34:42,856 --> 00:34:46,650
Hey, hey. Baby, baby.
Ladies, Tony's not that easy.

361
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:48,819
Let's get high and naked.

362
00:34:49,529 --> 00:34:51,655
Where's the fucking room?

363
00:34:55,285 --> 00:34:58,412
- That old man up there ...
- He and his men are regulars.

364
00:35:00,415 --> 00:35:01,957
They don't even bring their guns.

365
00:35:02,125 --> 00:35:04,585
- He has a gun.
- Just him. No one else.

366
00:35:04,753 --> 00:35:06,754
You pay for Fingers' protection.

367
00:35:08,924 --> 00:35:10,591
It's worth every penny.

368
00:35:14,888 --> 00:35:17,640
You know you're
always welcome to stay.

369
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:22,937
I don't entertain anymore.

370
00:35:23,104 --> 00:35:24,939
Unless I choose to.

371
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,693
Can you do me a favor?

372
00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:31,237
Anything.

373
00:35:31,822 --> 00:35:33,447
Tell Tony that

374
00:35:33,615 --> 00:35:35,866
I'll be back after my rounds.

375
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:37,993
Of course.

376
00:35:48,839 --> 00:35:53,050
When you can see the future,
you think you're
capable of changing it.

377
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,886
But you're just a witness
to coming moments,

378
00:35:56,054 --> 00:35:59,223
unable to help, even if you wanted to.

379
00:36:00,642 --> 00:36:02,893
And maybe you don't.

380
00:36:04,646 --> 00:36:07,106
Sometimes you think
you're supposed to learn something ...

381
00:36:07,274 --> 00:36:09,733
Come on, man! Give me some!

382
00:36:10,151 --> 00:36:12,319
... about patience or distance.

383
00:36:13,572 --> 00:36:16,448
But in the end,
it's all about discipline.

384
00:36:16,825 --> 00:36:19,660
Seeing things you
don't always want to.

385
00:36:21,454 --> 00:36:23,330
And just moving on.

386
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:30,170
After a while, things become easier.

387
00:36:33,425 --> 00:36:36,176
Routine keeps your mind from wandering.

388
00:36:44,394 --> 00:36:46,979
You begin to accept
things as they are.

389
00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:01,994
Every man has his destiny.

390
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:08,792
You can't escape it.
Even if you can see it coming.

391
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:36,236
Where you going, baby?

392
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:51,794
Hi.

393
00:38:15,777 --> 00:38:16,944
Hey, come on, baby.
Come on, get the fuck up.

394
00:38:17,112 --> 00:38:18,028
No!

395
00:38:18,196 --> 00:38:20,823
- You're in the wrong room!
- No!

396
00:38:23,284 --> 00:38:25,327
Don't fucking touch me!

397
00:38:25,495 --> 00:38:26,996
Hey, come on, baby, come on.
You don't want to do this ...

398
00:38:27,163 --> 00:38:29,665
- Don't tell me what to do!
- My bad.

399
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,837
Oh, no, no, no, no.
We were having a very nice time,

400
00:38:35,005 --> 00:38:36,672
so go away!

401
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:39,425
- Fuck! Take it easy.
- No! No!

402
00:38:39,592 --> 00:38:40,884
Come on!

403
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:43,595
Petrovich!

404
00:38:46,891 --> 00:38:48,475
- Petrovich.
- Drop the fucking gun.

405
00:38:48,643 --> 00:38:50,728
No, no, mate, you got this all
wrong, man. This isn't my fault.

406
00:38:50,895 --> 00:38:52,396
- The gun went off by itself!
- Drop the fucking gun!

407
00:38:52,564 --> 00:38:54,690
It's not my fucking fault, man!
The fucking gun just went off!

408
00:38:54,858 --> 00:38:55,983
Then there's nothing to worry about.

409
00:38:56,151 --> 00:38:58,068
Don't fucking come
any fucking closer, dude.

410
00:38:58,236 --> 00:39:00,571
I'll fucking use this, man.
I'll fucking ... Don't ...

411
00:39:00,739 --> 00:39:02,281
Get the fuck back, man.

412
00:39:02,449 --> 00:39:04,033
You're going to shoot us all?

413
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,200
Hey!

414
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:15,127
Let's go.

415
00:39:39,778 --> 00:39:42,279
I did nothing! I did nothing!

416
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,367
I did nothing!

417
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:05,886
-What are we doing, man?
We have the gun.
-No. No killing today.

418
00:40:06,888 --> 00:40:07,888
Fuck!

419
00:40:22,028 --> 00:40:23,821
What the fuck you
waiting for, huh?

420
00:40:23,988 --> 00:40:27,449
So, why all this effort when
you know what's going to happen?

421
00:40:27,617 --> 00:40:30,369
Will watching a person's fate
give it purpose?

422
00:40:31,287 --> 00:40:35,415
Or is it just the muted feeling
of watching a movie when you
know how it ends?

423
00:40:39,754 --> 00:40:43,048
And then something happens
that I will never forget.

424
00:40:46,469 --> 00:40:47,469
Come on!

425
00:40:49,722 --> 00:40:50,764
I'm wrong.

426
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:54,560
For the first time ever,
fate takes a detour,

427
00:40:54,727 --> 00:40:57,479
and I glimpse something
strange and new.

428
00:41:01,484 --> 00:41:02,651
Run!

429
00:41:03,486 --> 00:41:05,821
A future where anything can happen.

430
00:41:07,282 --> 00:41:09,241
It's a beautiful thing.

431
00:41:10,243 --> 00:41:12,995
And the feeling it gives me

432
00:41:13,163 --> 00:41:15,414
is as close as I've ever felt

433
00:41:20,587 --> 00:41:22,880
to pleasure.

434
00:41:37,353 --> 00:41:41,148
Sir, sir, can you tell me
what happened to you?

435
00:41:41,316 --> 00:41:44,067
I don't know. You tell me.

436
00:41:59,667 --> 00:42:01,001
There's my boy.

437
00:42:11,888 --> 00:42:14,014
I appreciate what you did for Tony.

438
00:42:19,187 --> 00:42:21,647
How come you didn't see it coming?

439
00:42:23,441 --> 00:42:26,193
Don't worry about it.
Just get better.

440
00:42:26,361 --> 00:42:28,362
We need you back.

441
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:32,783
I need you back.

442
00:42:34,577 --> 00:42:36,411
The guys that did this to you,

443
00:42:36,579 --> 00:42:38,664
I'm going to take care of it.

444
00:42:38,831 --> 00:42:41,458
'Cause nobody treats my boy this way.

445
00:42:42,126 --> 00:42:43,210
Nobody.

446
00:42:43,419 --> 00:42:46,129
This is a pre-boarding
call for flight 62 ...

447
00:42:46,297 --> 00:42:50,968
Chaos, mayhem, panic in the streets.
My work here is done.

448
00:42:53,513 --> 00:42:54,680
Um ...

449
00:42:56,641 --> 00:42:57,641
Thanks.

450
00:43:01,354 --> 00:43:05,440
And don't worry, you know,
pussy's ... Pussy's still
going to line up for you.

451
00:43:06,901 --> 00:43:08,860
Chicks love scars.

452
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:13,740
It's like a road map
of the soul, you know?

453
00:43:16,536 --> 00:43:17,452
Hey.

454
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:21,498
It's a new day, and I have
no idea what to expect.

455
00:43:22,083 --> 00:43:26,169
I can change someone's life if
I feel like it, make it worse,

456
00:43:28,298 --> 00:43:29,548
or better.

457
00:43:32,051 --> 00:43:33,760
It's up to me.

458
00:43:46,065 --> 00:43:49,484
A girl with a future
I can't see enters my life.

459
00:43:49,694 --> 00:43:53,530
On the same day, my visions
fail me for the first time.

460
00:43:57,452 --> 00:44:00,829
There are some people
that believe in coincidences.

461
00:44:01,831 --> 00:44:03,707
I am not one of them.

462
00:44:16,262 --> 00:44:17,512
This has got to get old, huh?

463
00:44:18,181 --> 00:44:20,349
Every 10 minutes,
you got another guy like me

464
00:44:20,516 --> 00:44:22,851
asking you the same three questions.

465
00:44:23,019 --> 00:44:24,269
It's part of my job.

466
00:44:24,437 --> 00:44:27,689
Well, I promise you that I'm going to
try to make it interesting, okay?

467
00:44:27,857 --> 00:44:30,650
I'm all about asking questions
that no one else asks.

468
00:44:30,818 --> 00:44:32,569
- No one?
- No one.

469
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:34,654
You gotta trust me, okay?
It's going to be fun.

470
00:44:34,822 --> 00:44:35,822
You're sweet.

471
00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:37,157
- Forty seconds.
- Got you.

472
00:44:37,325 --> 00:44:39,284
- Thanks, Danny.
- Frank's here.

473
00:44:39,452 --> 00:44:40,410
Where?

474
00:44:40,912 --> 00:44:41,870
What does he want?

475
00:44:42,038 --> 00:44:43,747
He needs to change your schedule.
Some kind of meeting.

476
00:44:43,915 --> 00:44:44,790
And cameras rolling!

477
00:44:44,957 --> 00:44:48,377
So, Trista, thank you for
sitting down with me today.

478
00:44:48,544 --> 00:44:50,045
Oh, for you, anything.

479
00:44:51,005 --> 00:44:55,050
So, your debut album, it heralds you
as this fantastic new talent.

480
00:44:55,218 --> 00:44:58,303
Is there pressure to try to live up
to the hype?

481
00:44:58,471 --> 00:45:01,765
It's not hype.
You know, I'm not just a pretty face.

482
00:45:01,933 --> 00:45:04,142
I have something to say.

483
00:45:04,310 --> 00:45:06,395
I'm just so excited
that my fans want to hear it.

484
00:45:06,562 --> 00:45:08,105
Okay, but what is it about you

485
00:45:08,272 --> 00:45:11,108
that sets you apart from all the
other acts that are out there today?

486
00:45:11,275 --> 00:45:13,110
I think it's my musical influences.

487
00:45:13,277 --> 00:45:15,862
- You know, if you go back ...
- Okay, what I mean, you're young,

488
00:45:16,030 --> 00:45:17,864
you're pretty, you sing, you dance.

489
00:45:18,032 --> 00:45:19,783
Why should we care, right?

490
00:45:19,951 --> 00:45:24,246
I mean, what is it about you
that's so special?

491
00:45:26,416 --> 00:45:28,708
- What makes me special?
- Yeah.

492
00:45:30,837 --> 00:45:32,671
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

493
00:45:32,839 --> 00:45:35,882
Do you mean, like, what makes me
better than everyone else?

494
00:45:36,050 --> 00:45:38,218
No. Not better. Just ...

495
00:45:41,305 --> 00:45:46,476
Deserving.

496
00:45:47,603 --> 00:45:48,687
Um ...

497
00:45:49,689 --> 00:45:51,690
Well, I ...

498
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:53,608
- What is he doing?
- I have a really rare blood type.

499
00:45:53,776 --> 00:45:54,693
Don't worry.

500
00:45:54,861 --> 00:45:56,319
- How about that?
- What is he doing?

501
00:45:56,487 --> 00:45:57,779
It's okay. She's doing fine.

502
00:45:57,947 --> 00:46:00,657
It's called Kp A-B. Almost no one has it.

503
00:46:00,825 --> 00:46:02,576
That's my gift from God.

504
00:46:03,202 --> 00:46:07,706
Well, that, and I sing and dance
well enough to have millions of fans.

505
00:46:07,874 --> 00:46:08,915
Uh-oh.

506
00:46:10,042 --> 00:46:13,003
It's more like
hundreds of thousands. Right?

507
00:46:15,381 --> 00:46:18,216
Whatever. Doesn't make a difference.

508
00:46:19,427 --> 00:46:23,180
I have fans that chant my name
wherever I go.

509
00:46:23,347 --> 00:46:25,182
Come on, Trista, I mean ...

510
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:28,935
They're not even chanting
your real name, right?

511
00:46:30,646 --> 00:46:31,646
What?

512
00:46:31,814 --> 00:46:35,192
I mean, can't you at least tell us
your real name?

513
00:46:38,279 --> 00:46:39,654
I'll never tell.

514
00:46:39,864 --> 00:46:44,242
How about my name? We've met
like this now three times,
three different interviews.

515
00:46:44,410 --> 00:46:47,787
You say you'll do anything for me.

516
00:46:49,248 --> 00:46:50,582
What's my name?

517
00:46:51,584 --> 00:46:53,585
- We're done. We're done. We're done!
- Wait, wait. What, what?

518
00:46:53,753 --> 00:46:55,545
Take it easy. What's the problem?
What did I do?

519
00:46:55,713 --> 00:46:56,713
You.

520
00:46:56,881 --> 00:46:58,089
Danny. Danny.

521
00:46:58,799 --> 00:47:00,550
That son of a bitch
is going to be wiping asses

522
00:47:00,718 --> 00:47:02,427
for a living by the time
I'm through with him.

523
00:47:02,595 --> 00:47:03,678
Just take me home.

524
00:47:03,846 --> 00:47:06,431
We can't leave yet. We have a meeting.

525
00:47:06,891 --> 00:47:08,767
Are you kidding me?

526
00:47:08,935 --> 00:47:12,270
Don't worry. It's right on stage 10.
It'll be fast.

527
00:47:13,356 --> 00:47:16,983
Okay, now, flash Papa Fingers
those beautiful blue eyes.

528
00:47:17,944 --> 00:47:20,487
Randall's got nothing on you, kid.

529
00:47:24,325 --> 00:47:27,702
Fingers! What do you think?
Living the dream, huh?

530
00:47:28,246 --> 00:47:30,539
You ruined my shot, Frank.

531
00:47:32,542 --> 00:47:34,125
It's a pleasure meeting you.

532
00:47:34,293 --> 00:47:35,377
Fingers.

533
00:47:35,711 --> 00:47:39,714
It's cute. I guess I'm supposed
to ask why they call you that?

534
00:47:40,049 --> 00:47:43,552
I guess it's because when I talk,
I use my hands a lot.

535
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:45,720
Sorry.

536
00:47:46,305 --> 00:47:48,807
- You're Trista, right?
- Yeah.

537
00:47:50,142 --> 00:47:53,478
Now that we're friends,
let's get down to business.

538
00:47:54,313 --> 00:47:57,941
Sure. Trista, things are going great.
Single's getting play,

539
00:47:58,109 --> 00:48:01,152
the album's starting to sell,
the video is getting a lot of air time,

540
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:05,949
but there's a big difference
between having a video on MTV

541
00:48:06,325 --> 00:48:09,244
and being an artist
who headlines arenas.

542
00:48:09,412 --> 00:48:12,664
What Frank is trying to say is
that you need someone to take
you to the next level.

543
00:48:12,832 --> 00:48:14,916
Someone who's going to open doors.
Someone who's strong.

544
00:48:15,084 --> 00:48:16,042
- You're quitting?
- No.

545
00:48:16,210 --> 00:48:19,296
No. I'm not quitting. I'm not ...
I'm stepping aside.

546
00:48:19,714 --> 00:48:23,675
A person of his influence
can make you a superstar.

547
00:48:24,427 --> 00:48:27,762
He asks for things,
and people give them. Gladly.

548
00:48:30,558 --> 00:48:33,977
I'm so excited to be working
with you, and completely
committed to your success.

549
00:48:34,145 --> 00:48:36,313
And all I ask is you commit to me.

550
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:39,441
And that's our deal. That's our
promise that we make to each other.

551
00:48:39,609 --> 00:48:41,484
If anybody gets in our way,

552
00:48:43,904 --> 00:48:46,865
- I'll take care of it.
- I don't fucking believe this.

553
00:48:47,074 --> 00:48:48,241
- Get me a car.
- Trista, baby ...

554
00:48:48,409 --> 00:48:50,118
Oh, screw you, Frank!

555
00:48:56,876 --> 00:48:58,877
That didn't go so well.

556
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:01,171
It went fine.

557
00:49:07,303 --> 00:49:11,222
Tomorrow, we get to go shopping
for a new manager.

558
00:49:11,390 --> 00:49:13,099
Trista, there are contracts.

559
00:49:13,267 --> 00:49:14,893
Fuck contracts!

560
00:49:15,936 --> 00:49:16,811
I think I should go.

561
00:49:18,105 --> 00:49:19,939
Can you stay with her?

562
00:49:21,108 --> 00:49:22,192
Sure.

563
00:49:23,110 --> 00:49:25,111
Be back tomorrow.

564
00:49:34,413 --> 00:49:36,873
- I'm tired.
- Yeah.

565
00:49:44,674 --> 00:49:48,176
- Do you love me, Danny?
- Course I do.

566
00:49:49,261 --> 00:49:50,929
I love you, too.

567
00:49:55,017 --> 00:49:57,102
Leave the light on, Daddy.

568
00:49:58,688 --> 00:50:00,271
I don't like the dark.

569
00:50:03,442 --> 00:50:04,526
Daddy.

570
00:50:08,739 --> 00:50:12,158
My little girl's not nervous,
is she, huh? Come on.

571
00:50:13,244 --> 00:50:17,539
Don't worry. After school, I'll be
right here waiting for you, okay?

572
00:50:18,165 --> 00:50:19,833
Come on, let's go.

573
00:50:54,952 --> 00:50:56,536
Daddy?

574
00:51:09,967 --> 00:51:11,217
Danny!

575
00:51:11,886 --> 00:51:13,178
Danny?

576
00:51:26,609 --> 00:51:29,027
Your friends are not going to help you.

577
00:51:31,405 --> 00:51:34,908
Nobody's going to help you.
Nobody but me.

578
00:51:36,494 --> 00:51:41,498
Your manager has drained all your
accounts trying to pay me back.

579
00:51:42,541 --> 00:51:45,251
And that little piece of
paper that owns you

580
00:51:45,419 --> 00:51:48,338
is the only thing that's keeping
his ass alive.

581
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:50,840
Now, what does that mean?

582
00:51:51,008 --> 00:51:53,718
It means that you ...
You have nothing.

583
00:51:55,054 --> 00:51:58,807
And you are nothing unless I say
you are. And you are going on the road.

584
00:51:58,974 --> 00:52:02,811
And you're staying on the road
until I see profit.

585
00:52:04,438 --> 00:52:05,939
And if I ever have to
come back here again,

586
00:52:06,106 --> 00:52:07,482
we're going to have
a totally different conversation.

587
00:52:07,650 --> 00:52:09,400
You understand me?

588
00:52:41,892 --> 00:52:42,892
Cheers.

589
00:52:53,529 --> 00:52:54,529
Thanks.

590
00:52:57,575 --> 00:53:00,285
- Don't you think you've had enough?
- No.

591
00:53:01,912 --> 00:53:04,414
I don't think it's nearly enough.

592
00:53:04,957 --> 00:53:07,417
It can't be as bad as you think.

593
00:53:10,254 --> 00:53:14,799
You must get tired of not knowing
what the fuck you're talking about.

594
00:53:16,886 --> 00:53:19,846
Where were you anyway
when Frank was fucking me over?

595
00:53:20,973 --> 00:53:22,390
Were you in on it?

596
00:53:23,517 --> 00:53:24,893
Did you help him?

597
00:53:25,769 --> 00:53:29,439
No. Of course not.
I'm your friend.

598
00:53:32,401 --> 00:53:34,068
I can't remember.

599
00:53:36,405 --> 00:53:38,948
How much does being
my friend pay again?

600
00:53:44,914 --> 00:53:46,915
Allison, wait ... Wait, wait!

601
00:53:47,207 --> 00:53:48,583
Hey, who's paying
for the drinks?

602
00:53:48,751 --> 00:53:50,543
I didn't mean it. Come on!

603
00:53:57,801 --> 00:53:58,968
I'm sorry.

604
00:54:02,181 --> 00:54:05,808
- Trista!
- Trista! Oh, my God! Trista!

605
00:54:08,228 --> 00:54:10,730
Allison! Allison!

606
00:54:10,898 --> 00:54:13,816
Wait! God damn it! Come on!

607
00:54:13,984 --> 00:54:16,486
Oh, come on. I'm sorry.

608
00:54:18,238 --> 00:54:20,698
- Are you Trista?
- What?

609
00:54:20,866 --> 00:54:22,784
- Are you Trista?
- No.

610
00:54:22,952 --> 00:54:23,952
- Yes, you are.
- No, no, no.

611
00:54:24,119 --> 00:54:27,038
- Hey, can I have an autograph?
- Sure.

612
00:54:27,331 --> 00:54:30,083
- To Jake the hottie.
- Yeah, sure. Cute.

613
00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:32,669
- Trista, my sister loves you!
- I love your sister.

614
00:54:32,836 --> 00:54:34,837
- You looked great in your last movie.
- Thank you. Thanks.

615
00:54:35,005 --> 00:54:36,923
- You were the best, too.
- Thank you.

616
00:54:37,925 --> 00:54:39,467
- Trista! Trista!
- Stop!

617
00:54:39,635 --> 00:54:41,427
God, that fucking hurts.

618
00:54:41,595 --> 00:54:43,179
Hey, how about a picture?

619
00:54:43,347 --> 00:54:46,307
- Get a picture of this.
- No! Stop!

620
00:54:49,770 --> 00:54:51,562
I love you, Trista!

621
00:54:51,939 --> 00:54:53,272
We love you!

622
00:56:16,774 --> 00:56:18,816
- So, I can leave?
- Of course.

623
00:56:19,735 --> 00:56:22,653
What are you going to do?
Where you gonna go?

624
00:56:24,865 --> 00:56:30,286
I don't know. I mean,
I have shows coming up.

625
00:56:30,871 --> 00:56:32,413
Fingers owns you now.

626
00:56:35,042 --> 00:56:37,335
He'll work you until you're used up,

627
00:56:38,587 --> 00:56:41,130
and throw you away.
It's just what he does.

628
00:56:43,675 --> 00:56:45,676
What are you suggesting I do?

629
00:56:47,930 --> 00:56:50,556
Well, if Fingers knows that you've run,

630
00:56:50,724 --> 00:56:52,892
then he'll hunt you down.

631
00:56:58,899 --> 00:57:02,902
But, you know, the one place
that he won't look is ...

632
00:57:04,029 --> 00:57:05,279
Is right here.

633
00:57:05,948 --> 00:57:09,617
I could get some money together,
and you could ...

634
00:57:09,785 --> 00:57:14,455
You could get far enough away
that not even Fingers could touch you.

635
00:57:20,003 --> 00:57:22,004
Why are you helping me?

636
00:57:27,344 --> 00:57:28,678
I don't know.

637
00:57:33,142 --> 00:57:34,475
I just want to.

638
00:57:38,147 --> 00:57:40,273
For as long as I can remember,

639
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:46,529
I've never let myself

640
00:57:48,949 --> 00:57:50,449
want anything.

641
00:57:52,578 --> 00:57:54,704
Stay away from the windows,

642
00:57:55,789 --> 00:57:59,000
and, you know, help yourself
to anything in the kitchen.

643
00:57:59,585 --> 00:58:02,962
Otherwise, don't touch anything.

644
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:01,330
You okay?

645
01:00:02,374 --> 01:00:06,627
Yeah. I'm fine.
It's just ... Just work.

646
01:00:08,130 --> 01:00:09,630
What did you do today?

647
01:00:13,719 --> 01:00:15,219
I looked for you.

648
01:00:22,060 --> 01:00:25,229
I like what you've done with the place.

649
01:00:26,481 --> 01:00:29,775
I figured if I was going to be here
for a while ...

650
01:00:33,363 --> 01:00:35,906
Who's that in the picture with you?

651
01:00:37,492 --> 01:00:38,826
It's Markie.

652
01:00:40,704 --> 01:00:43,622
- Are you guys close?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

653
01:00:45,667 --> 01:00:47,501
We were. He's ...

654
01:00:50,172 --> 01:00:51,172
He died.

655
01:00:54,051 --> 01:00:55,926
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

656
01:01:00,807 --> 01:01:02,058
What happened?

657
01:01:07,564 --> 01:01:09,231
I saw it coming,

658
01:01:13,862 --> 01:01:15,905
and couldn't do anything to stop it.

659
01:01:18,742 --> 01:01:20,326
I know how that feels.

660
01:01:24,331 --> 01:01:28,876
Makes you feel like you never
want to feel anything

661
01:01:30,796 --> 01:01:32,296
ever again.

662
01:01:37,677 --> 01:01:39,428
- There.
- That's good.

663
01:01:41,598 --> 01:01:43,557
It's just what I need.

664
01:01:44,226 --> 01:01:45,601
More scars.

665
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:52,900
Did you know that
scars are the road map to the soul?

666
01:01:57,864 --> 01:01:58,948
Yes.

667
01:03:10,562 --> 01:03:14,857
It's been a couple weeks,
and I was thinking that
maybe  we could take a trip.

668
01:03:15,358 --> 01:03:16,734
Tomorrow?

669
01:03:17,277 --> 01:03:18,903
-You mean we're leaving?
-Yeah.

670
01:03:23,325 --> 01:03:24,825
What's in your hand?

671
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:28,329
That's nothing.
It's just something I think I saw.

672
01:03:29,122 --> 01:03:33,125
-It's not what you think, really.
-What do you have to do?

673
01:03:33,293 --> 01:03:36,253
Don't worry about it.
It's for a friend.

674
01:03:53,230 --> 01:03:55,856
-Hello?
-Who is this?

675
01:04:30,392 --> 01:04:31,684
Piece of shit!

676
01:04:38,275 --> 01:04:42,236
Three weeks we've been looking
for this tart. Three weeks!

677
01:04:42,404 --> 01:04:45,489
Asking around, busting heads,
you by my side, and all this time,

678
01:04:45,657 --> 01:04:48,242
she was sitting right here with you!

679
01:04:50,495 --> 01:04:53,080
You'd think when that scumbag
Frank begged for death,

680
01:04:53,248 --> 01:04:55,791
you would have shown some mercy
on the poor bastard,

681
01:04:55,959 --> 01:04:57,960
and told me the truth, but no!

682
01:04:58,128 --> 01:05:00,588
You just stood there and watched.

683
01:05:02,424 --> 01:05:04,592
You're a cold piece of work, my friend.

684
01:05:04,759 --> 01:05:07,011
A cold piece of fucking work.

685
01:05:09,431 --> 01:05:10,431
Oh.

686
01:05:10,682 --> 01:05:11,640
What's this?

687
01:05:11,808 --> 01:05:15,019
You putting some aside,
take your little lady on vacation?

688
01:05:15,186 --> 01:05:16,186
Huh?

689
01:05:16,438 --> 01:05:18,814
Is that yours? I don't think so!

690
01:05:20,692 --> 01:05:22,693
Leave me alone. Go.

691
01:05:26,197 --> 01:05:28,324
What's the matter with you?

692
01:05:30,243 --> 01:05:33,287
Back in the day,
you would have saw this coming.

693
01:05:35,749 --> 01:05:37,625
You're losing your touch.

694
01:05:42,422 --> 01:05:46,091
Did you say something to me?
You trying to say something to me?

695
01:05:46,259 --> 01:05:48,677
You put me in this situation!

696
01:05:57,020 --> 01:05:59,021
You think I'm a bad man?

697
01:06:00,690 --> 01:06:02,483
I'm talking to you.

698
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:05,110
I'm not a bad man.

699
01:06:08,323 --> 01:06:10,616
I want what everybody wants.

700
01:06:38,353 --> 01:06:40,062
I tried to give you everything.

701
01:06:40,230 --> 01:06:41,480
And what happened?
What did you do with it?

702
01:06:41,648 --> 01:06:42,856
But that wasn't enough for you!

703
01:06:43,024 --> 01:06:46,610
It wasn't enough! You wanted more.
You have all the love in the world,

704
01:06:46,778 --> 01:06:49,488
but that's not enough for you,
so you took my friend!

705
01:06:49,656 --> 01:06:52,282
And you turned him against me!
And then what?

706
01:06:52,450 --> 01:06:54,952
You're a selfish little shit!

707
01:06:58,289 --> 01:06:59,456
I guess ...

708
01:07:02,043 --> 01:07:05,045
You don't know what
you got until it's gone.

709
01:07:43,334 --> 01:07:44,334
Oh, my God.

710
01:07:54,095 --> 01:07:55,179
Tell me.

711
01:07:56,598 --> 01:07:57,931
Tell you what?

712
01:07:59,350 --> 01:08:00,934
Your

713
01:08:01,519 --> 01:08:03,270
real name.

714
01:09:00,745 --> 01:09:01,787
-Hi.
-Gate's closed.

715
01:09:01,955 --> 01:09:03,121
-No.
-You gotta go around the front.

716
01:09:03,289 --> 01:09:04,373
You gotta let me in.

717
01:09:04,541 --> 01:09:06,875
-No. Cool it.
- Please, please.
No, you don't understand.

718
01:09:07,043 --> 01:09:09,002
- I'm a doctor.
- You gotta go around front.

719
01:09:09,170 --> 01:09:10,087
Someone ...

720
01:09:10,255 --> 01:09:11,922
Someone is going to die.
I've got to see Trista.

721
01:09:12,090 --> 01:09:14,049
This is the last time I'm going
to tell you. Cool it!

722
01:09:14,217 --> 01:09:15,300
I got to see Trista!

723
01:09:16,553 --> 01:09:20,097
Come on, come on, man!
I'm a doctor!

724
01:09:20,890 --> 01:09:23,976
All right, she is going to fucking die,
and it's going to be your fault!

725
01:09:24,143 --> 01:09:25,727
Everyone has a purpose.

726
01:09:25,895 --> 01:09:29,565
Sometimes a person lives their entire
life without knowing what theirs is.

727
01:09:29,732 --> 01:09:32,651
Not me. I knew when I was 10.

728
01:09:36,531 --> 01:09:41,326
My purpose is to love the right
person wholly and completely.

729
01:09:42,495 --> 01:09:45,789
When I was 10,
that person was Heidi Fontel.

730
01:09:50,378 --> 01:09:52,838
But when Heidi's father moved
her family away,

731
01:09:53,006 --> 01:09:55,883
I was sure I would love again, and soon.

732
01:09:59,053 --> 01:10:00,387
I was wrong.

733
01:10:05,685 --> 01:10:07,811
I met Gina in med school.

734
01:10:08,021 --> 01:10:09,605
We were best friends.

735
01:10:09,772 --> 01:10:13,817
My roommate, Henry, said she was
the kind of girl you waited to marry.

736
01:10:14,569 --> 01:10:16,987
But I waited too long.

737
01:10:18,656 --> 01:10:20,782
She married Henry right out of college.

738
01:10:20,950 --> 01:10:22,534
And I was best man.

739
01:10:22,702 --> 01:10:25,662
And all these years later,
I guess I still am.

740
01:10:29,834 --> 01:10:31,043
So, where were we?

741
01:10:31,210 --> 01:10:35,213
Henry was trying to make a point.
Henry's trying ...
He's trying to make a point.

742
01:10:35,381 --> 01:10:38,425
- About you joining him in plastics?
- What else?

743
01:10:38,593 --> 01:10:41,511
Bob is rich. That's not right.

744
01:10:41,679 --> 01:10:45,182
And Derek. Derek barely graduated,
and Derek is rich as shit!

745
01:10:45,350 --> 01:10:46,934
It's not all about the money.

746
01:10:47,101 --> 01:10:50,520
Hey, you put in the time,
you do the work,

747
01:10:50,688 --> 01:10:51,897
you ought to be compensated.

748
01:10:52,065 --> 01:10:54,483
-I'm doing fine.
- A lot of folks are doing fine.

749
01:10:54,651 --> 01:10:57,444
She's doing fine. Oh, that's right.
She's the waitress.

750
01:10:57,612 --> 01:10:58,612
Everyone else I know?

751
01:10:58,780 --> 01:11:00,614
- Rich as shit!
- I'm not.

752
01:11:00,782 --> 01:11:02,824
But you're doing genius research
which one day will lead

753
01:11:02,992 --> 01:11:04,534
to an amazing discovery.

754
01:11:04,702 --> 01:11:06,578
- Maybe.
- And that will lead to patents,

755
01:11:06,746 --> 01:11:08,246
and now we're talking stupid rich.

756
01:11:08,414 --> 01:11:10,916
There's nothing wrong with her trying
to make people's lives better.

757
01:11:11,084 --> 01:11:15,420
No. It's fantastic. I love her for
it. I make people's lives better.

758
01:11:17,423 --> 01:11:19,883
I do. Come on.

759
01:11:20,051 --> 01:11:23,387
Okay, I admit it.
The boob jobs and the Botox,

760
01:11:23,554 --> 01:11:27,516
that's what pays for my amazing car.
Okay, but consider this. A girl is born

761
01:11:27,684 --> 01:11:30,143
with a nose that could kill on sight.

762
01:11:30,311 --> 01:11:33,563
There's no prom day for this girl,
no shy first kiss.

763
01:11:33,731 --> 01:11:35,899
She gets in an accident, sure,
you patch her up fine.

764
01:11:36,067 --> 01:11:39,403
But eventually, this girl's going to
write a goodbye letter to her cat,

765
01:11:39,570 --> 01:11:41,279
and throw herself off a rooftop.

766
01:11:41,447 --> 01:11:43,615
The same girl, she comes to me,

767
01:11:43,783 --> 01:11:47,494
I do a little of my magic,
and, my friend, that
letter never gets written.

768
01:11:47,662 --> 01:11:49,496
I have saved a life.

769
01:11:52,166 --> 01:11:54,418
Hey, I saved a life today.

770
01:11:54,585 --> 01:11:57,379
Maybe I did, too. We'll never know.

771
01:11:58,131 --> 01:12:02,718
But either way, I'm going to
sleep tonight in one big
mother-fucking house.

772
01:12:03,761 --> 01:12:05,178
I gotta pee.

773
01:12:06,639 --> 01:12:09,016
- My husband.
- Your husband.

774
01:12:15,231 --> 01:12:18,025
- So, how are the snakes?
- They're great.

775
01:12:18,192 --> 01:12:20,485
My hours are killing me, though.

776
01:12:20,653 --> 01:12:22,320
You feeling all right?

777
01:12:22,488 --> 01:12:24,781
I'm exhausted.
Been fighting a cold, too.

778
01:12:24,949 --> 01:12:27,784
- You should come see me tomorrow.
- I don't want to bother you.

779
01:12:27,952 --> 01:12:30,954
That's impossible.
You know that, right?

780
01:12:33,332 --> 01:12:34,416
Take care.

781
01:12:36,252 --> 01:12:37,335
Jesus.

782
01:12:38,129 --> 01:12:39,755
Think about what I said.

783
01:12:39,922 --> 01:12:40,922
Oh, man, thank you.

784
01:12:44,510 --> 01:12:45,385
Are you this way?

785
01:12:45,553 --> 01:12:48,180
- No, I'm actually parked out back.
- I'm sorry.

786
01:12:48,681 --> 01:12:51,850
- You're going to be okay?
- Yeah, I'm used to this.

787
01:12:53,019 --> 01:12:55,187
- Love you.
- Love you, too.

788
01:13:05,615 --> 01:13:07,407
- Bring me the vial.
- All right.

789
01:13:08,242 --> 01:13:10,452
Yeah. Here we go.

790
01:13:10,953 --> 01:13:13,872
You're going to cure
hemophilia, little guy.

791
01:13:14,665 --> 01:13:15,582
Dr. Sweet?

792
01:13:15,750 --> 01:13:16,625
Mmm-hmm.

793
01:13:16,793 --> 01:13:19,878
This isn't a rattler.
Maybe you want to break out the gear.

794
01:13:20,046 --> 01:13:21,213
Don't worry.

795
01:13:25,551 --> 01:13:27,511
- What do we got?
- Snake bite.

796
01:13:27,887 --> 01:13:30,680
Let me take a look. Oh, my God.

797
01:13:31,057 --> 01:13:33,183
They sent us the wrong anti-venom!

798
01:13:33,351 --> 01:13:34,726
- She needs a transfusion now!
- Gina?

799
01:13:34,894 --> 01:13:38,563
Hey, Gina. Gina. Can you hear me?
Gina, hi. Hi.

800
01:13:38,940 --> 01:13:40,148
- Come on, wake up now.
- My blood ...

801
01:13:40,316 --> 01:13:41,483
What?

802
01:13:43,903 --> 01:13:45,278
- What did she say?
- I'm not sure.

803
01:13:45,446 --> 01:13:47,447
Something about her blood.
Get her blood type. What bit her?

804
01:13:47,615 --> 01:13:49,533
- A Russell viper.
- All right, tell me about this snake.

805
01:13:49,700 --> 01:13:53,411
You don't understand. It's already
in her heart. She needs a transfusion.

806
01:13:53,579 --> 01:13:56,873
- Get me that blood type now!
- She's got 24 hours!

807
01:14:00,878 --> 01:14:03,630
- Okay.
- Doctor, I have her blood type.

808
01:14:03,798 --> 01:14:05,882
What? What the hell is this?

809
01:14:06,050 --> 01:14:09,803
- The lab said it's extremely rare.
- All right.
Do we have any of this in stock?

810
01:14:09,971 --> 01:14:12,139
- I've never even seen it
come through here.
- All right. Check again.

811
01:14:12,306 --> 01:14:14,307
- No, Doctor ...
- Just do it!

812
01:14:14,475 --> 01:14:18,645
Henry? Henry? Did Gina keep
any of her own blood in storage?

813
01:14:19,897 --> 01:14:24,442
All right, look. Listen, she's ...
She's been bitten.

814
01:14:24,610 --> 01:14:27,237
Hello! Can you check again, please?
It's very rare. Next week is too late.

815
01:14:27,405 --> 01:14:30,073
Thailand? Please don't put me on
hold. Please don't put me on hold.

816
01:14:30,241 --> 01:14:32,033
Please ... Damn!

817
01:14:36,539 --> 01:14:39,749
We don't have it, Doctor. I checked
the computer files, but it's useless!

818
01:14:39,917 --> 01:14:42,711
It's not in there.
We don't have her blood type!

819
01:14:42,879 --> 01:14:45,338
Doctor! Stop it, Doctor!

820
01:14:46,215 --> 01:14:48,717
We don't have the blood type.
That's why ...

821
01:14:49,302 --> 01:14:50,510
Nick!

822
01:14:53,890 --> 01:14:55,348
- Damn it!
- Wait! What are you doing?

823
01:14:55,516 --> 01:14:57,309
No, no, no. Wait, wait.
You don't understand.

824
01:14:57,476 --> 01:15:01,438
You've got to let me go!
You don't understand!
She's going to die!

825
01:15:01,939 --> 01:15:04,441
All right. All right, all right!
All right!

826
01:15:05,109 --> 01:15:08,236
I'm fine. I'm all right.
Just let me go. Let me go.

827
01:15:08,571 --> 01:15:11,114
Okay, I'm fine. I'm all right.

828
01:15:20,208 --> 01:15:22,209
I'm here live inside
Palm Hill Studios,

829
01:15:22,376 --> 01:15:25,212
where Trista has begun production
on her second music video.

830
01:15:25,379 --> 01:15:28,006
Now, we're not allowed to take you
inside the actual shooting,

831
01:15:28,174 --> 01:15:30,258
but while we're waiting, why don't
we take another look at a clip

832
01:15:30,426 --> 01:15:33,011
from a recent interview
that had everybody wondering,

833
01:15:33,179 --> 01:15:35,847
"Pop superstar or pop meItdown?"

834
01:15:36,015 --> 01:15:38,141
- What makes me special?
- Yeah.

835
01:15:38,309 --> 01:15:39,976
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

836
01:15:40,144 --> 01:15:42,979
Do you mean, like, what makes me
better than everyone else?

837
01:15:43,147 --> 01:15:45,148
No. Not better. Just ...

838
01:15:45,399 --> 01:15:48,026
Deserving.

839
01:15:49,654 --> 01:15:53,114
I have a really rare blood type.
How about that?

840
01:15:53,282 --> 01:15:54,324
A blood type?

841
01:15:54,492 --> 01:15:58,995
Yeah, it's called Kp A-B.
Almost no one has it.

842
01:16:00,456 --> 01:16:01,957
That's my gift from God.

843
01:16:26,899 --> 01:16:28,233
Okay, I talked to the director.

844
01:16:28,401 --> 01:16:30,402
I told him no more than two
full run-throughs of the song.

845
01:16:30,569 --> 01:16:31,736
Thank you.

846
01:16:33,823 --> 01:16:35,156
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

847
01:16:35,324 --> 01:16:36,408
You need some air?

848
01:16:36,575 --> 01:16:38,576
- No, I think I can ...
- I think you need some air.

849
01:16:38,744 --> 01:16:41,538
Could everyone please back off?
She needs air!

850
01:16:41,706 --> 01:16:42,872
Let's go, honey.

851
01:16:44,417 --> 01:16:46,876
I mean it! Back off!

852
01:16:47,545 --> 01:16:48,545
Let's go.

853
01:16:53,259 --> 01:16:55,677
- Put this on.
- What's going on?

854
01:16:55,845 --> 01:16:58,638
Your plane ticket and passport
are in the pocket.

855
01:16:58,806 --> 01:16:59,806
- Hi.
- Gate's closed.

856
01:16:59,974 --> 01:17:01,099
- No.
- You gotta go around the front.

857
01:17:01,267 --> 01:17:02,267
You gotta let me in.

858
01:17:02,435 --> 01:17:04,561
- No.
- Wait, I ...

859
01:17:04,937 --> 01:17:06,021
I'm a doctor.

860
01:17:06,188 --> 01:17:09,065
Don't call anyone.
Just lay low for a little while.

861
01:17:09,233 --> 01:17:11,443
Give me some time, and I'll make
sure that someone gets to you.

862
01:17:11,610 --> 01:17:12,694
I'm a doctor!

863
01:17:14,113 --> 01:17:17,949
All right, she is going to fucking die,
and it's going to be your fault!

864
01:17:18,117 --> 01:17:20,410
She's going to fucking die!

865
01:17:27,877 --> 01:17:29,044
Trista?

866
01:17:30,046 --> 01:17:32,339
- Trista, wait! Wait!
- No, no, don't get near her! Get in!

867
01:17:32,506 --> 01:17:34,257
- No, no, Gina ...
- No!

868
01:17:34,425 --> 01:17:37,510
- Let go of Allison! Help!
- Sorry, I'll explain later!

869
01:17:40,181 --> 01:17:42,557
Trista! Wait! Wait! Wait!

870
01:17:45,728 --> 01:17:50,899
Trista? My God, Trista?
Trista. Trista, are you okay?

871
01:17:52,151 --> 01:17:55,278
Oh, God! Trista.

872
01:17:55,446 --> 01:17:56,821
Trista?

873
01:18:22,848 --> 01:18:26,810
I pushed back your concert dates
and canceled your video shoot.

874
01:18:29,939 --> 01:18:31,940
And I'm not mad at you.

875
01:18:32,108 --> 01:18:35,610
Even though I know you tried to leave.

876
01:18:37,780 --> 01:18:39,406
But I'm not mad at you.

877
01:18:40,366 --> 01:18:42,367
When were you going to tell me?

878
01:18:44,078 --> 01:18:46,579
- Tell you what?
- About the baby.

879
01:18:47,456 --> 01:18:49,791
- I'm pregnant?
- Three weeks.

880
01:18:57,341 --> 01:18:58,758
You didn't know?

881
01:19:07,351 --> 01:19:10,645
It's gonna be okay.
I know what you're trying to do.

882
01:19:11,564 --> 01:19:15,525
You want the whole world to love you,
and that's a dangerous fucking life.

883
01:19:16,110 --> 01:19:17,610
And you can't do it alone.

884
01:19:17,778 --> 01:19:20,321
But I'm gonna take care of you.
I'm gonna make that happen.

885
01:19:20,489 --> 01:19:22,073
All your dreams will come true.

886
01:19:22,241 --> 01:19:24,951
And to put that aside would mean
that he died for no reason.

887
01:19:25,119 --> 01:19:27,203
It would mean you killed him for no reason.

888
01:19:27,371 --> 01:19:29,164
No. We have a deal.

889
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:34,127
He got in the way. And I did my part.
Now it's time for you to do your part.

890
01:19:34,670 --> 01:19:36,880
We both lost someone special.

891
01:19:37,047 --> 01:19:39,174
Now it's time to move on.

892
01:19:39,717 --> 01:19:41,718
I hate you.

893
01:19:43,012 --> 01:19:47,140
Until the day I die, I will hate you.

894
01:19:58,194 --> 01:20:00,236
You can't keep the baby.

895
01:20:01,197 --> 01:20:03,948
- What?
- You got concert dates and TV appearances.

896
01:20:04,116 --> 01:20:05,158
You can't keep the baby.

897
01:20:05,326 --> 01:20:07,994
- It's my baby.
- No one gets in our way!

898
01:20:08,162 --> 01:20:09,537
No one!

899
01:20:14,502 --> 01:20:19,255
You got a concert date in two
weeks. Gives us plenty of time
to take care of this.

900
01:20:19,423 --> 01:20:21,591
I'm gonna make the arrangements.

901
01:22:33,932 --> 01:22:36,017
Wait, wait, wait. Wait.

902
01:22:36,185 --> 01:22:38,519
No, no. No. Stop!

903
01:23:06,507 --> 01:23:07,715
Stop!

904
01:23:21,939 --> 01:23:24,190
You're going to
have to reach for me.

905
01:23:28,070 --> 01:23:29,070
Please.

906
01:23:31,156 --> 01:23:32,532
I need you.

907
01:23:36,286 --> 01:23:37,286
Please.

908
01:24:40,058 --> 01:24:41,934
- Hi.
- Hey.

909
01:25:14,635 --> 01:25:15,635
Hey.

910
01:25:19,932 --> 01:25:21,015
So,

911
01:25:22,434 --> 01:25:24,435
you saved a life today.

912
01:25:25,103 --> 01:25:26,103
You, too.

913
01:25:29,691 --> 01:25:32,902
It's funny.
It's the only thing that matters.

914
01:25:34,738 --> 01:25:36,280
All the rest of it ...

915
01:25:39,535 --> 01:25:41,285
I'm glad your baby's okay.

916
01:25:43,664 --> 01:25:44,664
Me, too.

917
01:25:47,376 --> 01:25:49,794
- Thanks for the loaner.
- Sure.

918
01:25:50,838 --> 01:25:53,798
- I'll get it back to
you as soon as I can.
- Whatever.

919
01:25:59,471 --> 01:26:00,972
You okay?

920
01:26:03,934 --> 01:26:06,143
Yeah. I will be.

921
01:26:09,314 --> 01:26:11,399
It's hard starting over.

922
01:26:14,027 --> 01:26:15,695
You'll be fine.

923
01:26:17,239 --> 01:26:20,199
So will you. Thank you.

924
01:26:41,305 --> 01:26:43,639
I'm sorry, sir,
but you can't go in there.

925
01:26:43,807 --> 01:26:47,476
Sir! Sir, you're not allowed!

926
01:27:29,394 --> 01:27:31,395
Dude, that was crazy!

927
01:27:32,773 --> 01:27:36,776
Are you okay?
