2
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,300
Market reports today...

3
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:15,869
barrows and gilts at 220 to 260 pounds
are lower at $40.

4
00:01:15,946 --> 00:01:19,541
Sows are steady.
300 to 500 pounds, $34 to $37.

5
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:23,609
Goin' over to the feeder cattle,
beef steers, $120 to $150...

6
00:01:25,455 --> 00:01:26,444
The way I like to do it...

7
00:01:26,523 --> 00:01:29,583
is I take one can
of cream of mushroom soup...

8
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:31,560
and then one package of egg noodles.

9
00:01:31,628 --> 00:01:34,688
I like the egg noodles
better than the Italian ones.

10
00:01:34,765 --> 00:01:35,891
I like to put...

11
00:01:39,403 --> 00:01:42,270
If we look at what the Lord said
in the book of Revelation...

12
00:01:42,339 --> 00:01:45,536
you can be sure
that there's a price to pay...

13
00:01:45,609 --> 00:01:50,205
for the way of the flesh
and that price will be paid if you don't...

14
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,910
Here's the wind-up and the pitch.

15
00:01:54,985 --> 00:01:57,112
And it's two and two, two and two...

16
00:02:05,762 --> 00:02:07,696
Before you just say,
"Honey, I think we have to have...

17
00:02:07,764 --> 00:02:10,130
"some couple's counseling.
I mean, I think we have a problem.

18
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,189
"I can't leave a cup here for..."

19
00:02:21,178 --> 00:02:23,703
All right. It's time for traffic on the fives...

20
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,338
and let's find out
what's going on with your drive.

21
00:02:25,415 --> 00:02:27,212
Let's go to Chopper.
Chopper, what's happening?

22
00:02:27,284 --> 00:02:29,912
All right, Lettie.
We got a fifteen-minute, uh, wait... 494.

23
00:02:29,987 --> 00:02:32,182
There's an accident working
at the spaghetti junction.

24
00:02:32,256 --> 00:02:34,588
at 630, but it still
will make a very slow go...

25
00:02:55,312 --> 00:02:59,373
A quiet night in a city that knows
how to keep its secrets.

26
00:02:59,449 --> 00:03:04,318
But one man is still looking for
the answers to life's persistent questions.

27
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:10,820
That's me.

28
00:03:10,894 --> 00:03:12,953
Or it used to be.

29
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:15,294
It was a rainy Saturday night in St. Paul...

30
00:03:15,432 --> 00:03:18,060
and I had just finished off
a grilled cheese sandwich...

31
00:03:18,135 --> 00:03:19,500
with beans for a chaser...

32
00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:22,231
and it was time to head
for work across the street.

33
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:35,279
I'm a private eye.

34
00:03:35,352 --> 00:03:36,842
Noir's the name.

35
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,444
Guy Noir.

36
00:03:38,522 --> 00:03:42,549
But I'd taken temporary employment
about six years before...

37
00:03:42,626 --> 00:03:47,825
doing security for a radio show
called A Prairie Home Companion...

38
00:03:47,898 --> 00:03:50,890
on account of a serious
cash-flow problem...

39
00:03:50,968 --> 00:03:55,530
due to a lack of missing heiresses
and dead tycoons lying in the solarium...

40
00:03:55,605 --> 00:03:59,302
with lipstick stains
on their smoking jackets.

41
00:03:59,376 --> 00:04:02,607
In other words, I was broke.

42
00:04:02,679 --> 00:04:06,581
This radio show was done
out of an old theater called the Fitzgerald...

43
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:09,915
and it had been on the air
since Jesus was in the third grade.

44
00:04:09,987 --> 00:04:13,980
But it was still pulling in
a few hundred people on Saturday nights.

45
00:04:14,057 --> 00:04:19,017
It was a live radio variety show,
the kind that died fifty years ago...

46
00:04:19,096 --> 00:04:24,261
but somebody forgot to tell them
until this night.

47
00:04:24,334 --> 00:04:28,134
A big corporation down in Texas
had bought up the radio station...

48
00:04:28,205 --> 00:04:30,867
and their axeman,
a guy named Cruett...

49
00:04:30,941 --> 00:04:33,535
was on his way to St. Paul
to shut the thing down...

50
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:36,101
and turn the theater
into a parking lot.

51
00:04:39,182 --> 00:04:43,346
It was curtains and everybody knew it,
but nobody said so.

52
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,354
They were Midwesterners.

53
00:04:45,422 --> 00:04:49,722
They felt like if you ignored bad news,
it might go away.

54
00:04:49,793 --> 00:04:53,388
Not my philosophy,
but I'm not from here.

55
00:04:53,463 --> 00:04:55,055
Stay on the edge of the crowd.

56
00:04:55,132 --> 00:04:56,121
Keep your eyes open.

57
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:58,326
That's my motto.

58
00:04:58,402 --> 00:05:01,599
It was my last night
of gainful employment...

59
00:05:01,671 --> 00:05:04,970
and I had a feeling
it was maybe going to be interesting.

What... OK, OK.

72
00:05:41,778 --> 00:05:43,211
Jesus, the schedule.

73
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,043
Uh...

74
00:05:45,115 --> 00:05:46,673
Where's my pencil?
I gotta show you some changes.

75
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:47,739
Where's my pencil?

76
00:05:47,818 --> 00:05:48,876
I just put it down here a second ago.

77
00:05:48,952 --> 00:05:50,180
Where'd you put it last?

78
00:05:50,253 --> 00:05:51,379
I just had it here a second ago.

79
00:05:51,455 --> 00:05:52,649
Oh, it's... it's...

80
00:05:52,722 --> 00:05:53,814
Don't mess with those.

81
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:55,824
Hey, hey, hey.
Please, move that back.

82
00:05:55,892 --> 00:05:57,655
This one will make the...

83
00:05:57,727 --> 00:06:00,525
This will make the wife
green-eyed with envy.

84
00:06:00,597 --> 00:06:02,155
Ooh!

85
00:06:02,232 --> 00:06:03,199
One more.

86
00:06:03,266 --> 00:06:05,200
Do you think
she's coming by the studio?

87
00:06:05,268 --> 00:06:06,895
Cuddle up a little bit.
There you go.

88
00:06:08,572 --> 00:06:10,767
Hey, Guy.
How are you tonight?

89
00:06:10,841 --> 00:06:12,206
I need a little help from you.

90
00:06:12,275 --> 00:06:14,505
Take these Johnson Girl t-shirts.
Have someone take 'em up front.

91
00:06:14,578 --> 00:06:17,206
- I'll take care of it.
- Nice tie.

92
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,645
Well, it's about damn time.

93
00:06:18,715 --> 00:06:20,114
The very tardy Johnson Girls.

94
00:06:20,183 --> 00:06:21,150
Hey, Al.

95
00:06:21,218 --> 00:06:22,344
Givin' me a heart attack here.

96
00:06:22,419 --> 00:06:25,013
What is this? Rewrites?

97
00:06:25,088 --> 00:06:26,953
What's wrong with the old script?

98
00:06:27,023 --> 00:06:27,990
How does that feel?

99
00:06:28,058 --> 00:06:29,753
Give me a little sound effects on that one.

100
00:06:29,826 --> 00:06:32,659
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are now at six minutes to broadcast.

101
00:06:32,729 --> 00:06:34,356
Six minutes from broadcast, please.

102
00:06:34,431 --> 00:06:35,557
That's the... that's the...

103
00:06:35,632 --> 00:06:37,429
Hey, Rich, that's that Honolulu mama...

104
00:06:37,501 --> 00:06:39,469
how she could dance
in her pink pajamas...

105
00:06:39,536 --> 00:06:41,663
when she took off
her Oahu Oahu Oahu.

106
00:06:41,738 --> 00:06:44,138
No, it's an old
Carter family song, right?

107
00:06:44,207 --> 00:06:45,174
A what?

108
00:06:45,242 --> 00:06:47,506
Carter family, sweetheart.

109
00:06:47,577 --> 00:06:49,807
Just like us, only famous.

110
00:06:50,614 --> 00:06:51,945
Now, how long you been doin' this?

111
00:06:52,015 --> 00:06:54,483
Doin' what?
Puttin' my pants on?

112
00:06:54,551 --> 00:06:56,178
How long you been doin' radio?

113
00:06:56,253 --> 00:06:58,016
Oh.

114
00:06:58,088 --> 00:07:00,613
I don't know.
Thirty-some years, I guess.

115
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:03,784
Started out in Mark Twain Days,
Mississippi River...

116
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,226
and they hired me to play Huck Finn.

117
00:07:06,296 --> 00:07:10,096
I was running a raft
on the Mississippi...

118
00:07:10,167 --> 00:07:13,261
and carrying people across, and, uh...

119
00:07:13,336 --> 00:07:15,827
it ran into the wake of a steamboat.

120
00:07:15,906 --> 00:07:17,999
Mr. Keillor?
We need you on stage.

121
00:07:18,074 --> 00:07:19,041
Fine. I'm right there.

122
00:07:19,109 --> 00:07:21,942
Is this the story about the guy
who ends up hangin' from a kite...

123
00:07:22,012 --> 00:07:24,344
bein' pulled by a boat
with his shorts around his ankles?

124
00:07:24,414 --> 00:07:27,008
No. No, it's a different story
about a pontoon boat.

125
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:29,574
Oh! Look at this old house.

126
00:07:29,653 --> 00:07:31,280
Good-bye, old house.

127
00:07:31,354 --> 00:07:32,548
Good-bye, old porch.

128
00:07:32,622 --> 00:07:34,214
Good-bye, old Guy.

129
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:39,092
Hey, Guy. What are they gonna do
with this house, you think? Huh?

130
00:07:39,162 --> 00:07:41,426
I figure it had somethin' to do...

131
00:07:41,498 --> 00:07:44,695
with the dumpster
that showed up yesterday.

132
00:07:44,768 --> 00:07:46,201
Oh, my God.
Honey, listen.

133
00:07:46,269 --> 00:07:48,328
I brought you that cute little dress...

134
00:07:48,405 --> 00:07:50,532
I already told you,
I don't like the dress.

135
00:07:50,607 --> 00:07:51,574
At least try it on.

136
00:07:51,641 --> 00:07:52,665
I want to see it on you.

137
00:07:52,742 --> 00:07:53,902
You try it on.
I don't want to try it on.

138
00:07:53,977 --> 00:07:54,966
It's ugly.

139
00:07:55,045 --> 00:07:56,171
It's the color of vomit.

140
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:01,381
Oh, sorry.

141
00:08:05,388 --> 00:08:08,846
Old man Soderberg was
one of those people who was on that raft...

142
00:08:08,925 --> 00:08:13,021
and, uh, he went over the rail
and into the river...

143
00:08:13,096 --> 00:08:15,929
and I went in for him
'cause he couldn't swim.

144
00:08:15,999 --> 00:08:19,025
So, I pulled him out.

145
00:08:19,102 --> 00:08:20,262
You saved his life?

146
00:08:20,337 --> 00:08:22,669
Well, not really.
The river was shallow at that point...

147
00:08:22,739 --> 00:08:25,207
but he didn't know that
'cause I had hold of his ankles.

148
00:08:25,275 --> 00:08:26,902
I was towing him into shore.

149
00:08:26,977 --> 00:08:28,137
Hey! It's good to see ya!

150
00:08:28,211 --> 00:08:30,202
Four minutes from broadcast, please.

151
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,645
Four minutes.

152
00:08:31,715 --> 00:08:34,684
Ooh! Hey.

153
00:08:34,751 --> 00:08:35,843
Hey.

154
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,386
Wait a minute.
Where's my bag?

155
00:08:37,454 --> 00:08:38,614
No, no. The bag's here.

156
00:08:38,688 --> 00:08:39,916
I brought it in.

157
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:41,582
Mom, just look.

158
00:08:41,658 --> 00:08:43,250
Here it is.
Come on, Yolanda.

159
00:08:43,326 --> 00:08:46,853
I swear to God I'm all,
you know, verklempt.

160
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:48,795
Ha ha ha ha!

161
00:08:48,865 --> 00:08:49,957
Ohh.

162
00:08:50,033 --> 00:08:51,125
Hot.

163
00:08:51,201 --> 00:08:54,261
Yeah. See? Plenty of time.

164
00:08:54,337 --> 00:08:56,271
So he gave you the job at WLT.

165
00:08:56,339 --> 00:08:57,431
Well, his brother did, actually.

166
00:08:57,507 --> 00:08:58,599
Yeah, Art Soderberg.

167
00:08:58,675 --> 00:08:59,767
G.K. to the stage, please.

168
00:08:59,843 --> 00:09:01,811
Art Soderberg gave you the job.

169
00:09:01,878 --> 00:09:02,970
Yeah, it was a...

170
00:09:03,046 --> 00:09:04,172
It was
the early morning show, right?

171
00:09:04,247 --> 00:09:06,738
Rise and Shine Show.
Wilmer Scott, 5 a.m.

172
00:09:06,816 --> 00:09:08,078
Me and Dusty used to have
an early mornin' show.

173
00:09:08,151 --> 00:09:09,482
Is that right?
Excuse me, partner.

174
00:09:09,552 --> 00:09:10,678
Oh, yeah.
Breakfast at the Bunkhouse.

175
00:09:10,754 --> 00:09:13,154
TV show.
And, uh, it showed mostly...

176
00:09:13,223 --> 00:09:14,815
cartoons and stuff.
Remember that?

177
00:09:14,891 --> 00:09:16,518
- Oh, yeah?
- For the kids.

178
00:09:16,593 --> 00:09:19,926
Well, this was... uh, this came on
at 5:00 in the morning.

179
00:09:19,996 --> 00:09:20,963
And it was... uh, like a gospel show.

180
00:09:21,031 --> 00:09:22,931
- Inspirational show.
- Inspirational show.

181
00:09:22,999 --> 00:09:24,261
Wilmer Scott was the host of it.

182
00:09:24,334 --> 00:09:26,825
Wasn't Wilmer Scott the famous aviator?

183
00:09:26,903 --> 00:09:28,097
No.

184
00:09:28,171 --> 00:09:31,607
Yeah. First man to fly the length
of the Mississippi solo.

185
00:09:31,675 --> 00:09:32,903
- No.
- I don't think so.

186
00:09:32,976 --> 00:09:34,068
Right.

187
00:09:34,144 --> 00:09:35,509
That was his brother Wilbur Scott.

188
00:09:35,578 --> 00:09:36,704
We're now at three minutes...

189
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:39,112
Flew from New Orleans to Memphis...

190
00:09:39,182 --> 00:09:41,810
all the way up to Minnesota
to Lake Itasca.

191
00:09:41,885 --> 00:09:42,977
And when he got up there,
he tried to fire a signal rocket...

192
00:09:43,053 --> 00:09:44,884
out the cockpit window,
but it was closed.

193
00:09:44,954 --> 00:09:49,015
He became the first civilian pilot
to shoot himself down.

194
00:09:49,092 --> 00:09:50,184
- Ugh!
- No. That was Wilbur.

195
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,352
- You made that story up.
- Right.

196
00:09:51,428 --> 00:09:52,520
No, I'm talking
about Wilmer Scott.

197
00:09:52,595 --> 00:09:54,995
Crashed into the lake
at his moment of triumph.

198
00:09:55,065 --> 00:09:56,054
- No.
- Wilmer.

199
00:09:56,132 --> 00:09:58,896
- Wilmer. Yeah. He was the host...
- No. This was the...

200
00:09:58,968 --> 00:10:00,560
- Right.
- The Rise and Shine Show.

201
00:10:00,637 --> 00:10:01,934
Rise and Shine.

202
00:10:02,005 --> 00:10:04,940
Mr. Keillor, Al's on the verge
of a coronary up there.

203
00:10:05,008 --> 00:10:06,100
Yeah. I'm there.

204
00:10:06,176 --> 00:10:07,268
Now, how did he have time
to fly and do radio?

205
00:10:07,344 --> 00:10:08,436
G.K., sit down.
I gotta do your makeup.

206
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:10,843
You're thinking of Wilbur Scott, see?

207
00:10:10,914 --> 00:10:11,903
Yeah. It's not the same person.
Not the same person.

208
00:10:11,981 --> 00:10:13,107
- Yeah...
- He was dead.

209
00:10:13,183 --> 00:10:15,344
You know, we used
to have a dog in the act...

210
00:10:15,418 --> 00:10:17,409
when Wanda and Connie were in it...

211
00:10:17,487 --> 00:10:19,614
- and that dog would sing...
- Ooo!

212
00:10:19,689 --> 00:10:20,883
- Ha ha!
- Ha ha ha ha!

213
00:10:20,957 --> 00:10:23,892
We'd sing this old song
and he would howl! Ha ha ha!

214
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,723
Oh, my God, that was a dog.

215
00:10:25,795 --> 00:10:27,729
- I been thinkin' about him all day long.
- Yeah.

216
00:10:27,797 --> 00:10:29,321

- Let's go.
- Garrison!

262
00:11:48,545 --> 00:11:50,103
Wilmer Scott was the one
who hypnotized the chickens...

263
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,772
- There you go.
- on the show.

264
00:11:51,848 --> 00:11:53,816
He did like, what,
four of those chickens in a row.

265
00:11:53,883 --> 00:11:55,976
- Four or five of them.
- Who was Wilmer Scott?

266
00:11:56,052 --> 00:11:58,646
He was the host of that
Rise and Shine Show.

267
00:11:58,721 --> 00:12:00,279
Early in the morning. 5 a.m.

268
00:12:00,356 --> 00:12:02,517
That's, uh, what, uh,
G.K. got started in radio.

269
00:12:02,592 --> 00:12:03,684
Right. Gospel show.

270
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,022
And he hypnotized chickens
on the radio?

271
00:12:05,094 --> 00:12:07,119
No, but he did
the chickens on this show.

272
00:12:07,197 --> 00:12:08,289
On this show?

273
00:12:08,364 --> 00:12:09,456
Not on that Rise and Shine Show.

274
00:12:09,532 --> 00:12:10,863
OK.

275
00:12:10,934 --> 00:12:12,561
All right, let's dim the house lights.

276
00:12:12,635 --> 00:12:13,602
You remember when
he did those chickens?

277
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:15,035
- Hypnotized them?
- Yep.

278
00:12:15,104 --> 00:12:16,071
Chinese chickens, right?

279
00:12:16,139 --> 00:12:17,401

- 5 a.m.
- Right here.

300
00:12:49,439 --> 00:12:50,406
Then he quit drinking.

301
00:12:50,473 --> 00:12:52,873
- Uh-huh. OK.
- And he lost interest in radio.

302
00:12:52,942 --> 00:12:54,136
Check your barn doors.

303
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:55,472
He developed mic fright.

How did he quit drinkin'?

305
00:12:56,779 --> 00:12:57,768

00:13:40,056 --> 00:13:41,819
and welcome to a live broadcast...

318
00:13:41,891 --> 00:13:44,086
of A Prairie Home Companion
coming to you...

319
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,721
from WLT,
your friendly neighbor station.

320
00:13:48,331 --> 00:13:50,026
Noir, where you been?

321
00:13:50,099 --> 00:13:52,033
I was lookin' after the Johnson Girls.

322
00:13:52,101 --> 00:13:53,830
OK. Aren't you supposed
to be guarding the door?

323
00:13:53,903 --> 00:13:54,995
Are you worried about something?

324
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:57,733
Uh, I had a weird call
from some crazy lady, so...

325
00:13:57,807 --> 00:13:59,274
Oh, she's not that crazy.

326
00:13:59,342 --> 00:14:00,604
How do you know?

327
00:14:00,677 --> 00:14:01,974
Because I met her
earlier this afternoon.

328
00:14:02,045 --> 00:14:03,376
She came by.

329
00:14:03,446 --> 00:14:06,609
What does she look like?
You get a description?

330
00:14:06,683 --> 00:14:08,082
Yeah, I got a description.

331
00:14:08,151 --> 00:14:09,243
Yeah?

332
00:14:09,319 --> 00:14:10,547
She was beautiful.

333
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:15,319
Her hair was what God had in mind
when he said, let there be...

334
00:14:15,391 --> 00:14:17,120
Hair. Right. Hair.

335
00:14:17,193 --> 00:14:20,094
Hair. Yeah.

336
00:14:20,163 --> 00:14:21,687
She gave me a smile so sweet...

337
00:14:21,764 --> 00:14:24,130
you could've poured it
on your pancakes.

338
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,794
She was wearing a white
trench coat so white...

339
00:14:26,869 --> 00:14:29,861
that rain would be
embarrassed to fall on it.

340
00:14:29,939 --> 00:14:31,372
Got it. Right.

341
00:14:31,441 --> 00:14:32,601
The skirt she was
wearing was so tight...

342
00:14:32,675 --> 00:14:35,667
you could read
the embroidery on her underwear.

343
00:14:35,745 --> 00:14:42,480
It said, "Wash in lukewarm water
and spin lightly."

344
00:14:42,552 --> 00:14:44,144
OK, you're makin' it up.

345
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:48,884
She had a Mount Rushmore t-shirt on,
and those guys never looked so good.

346
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:50,823
Especially Jefferson and Lincoln.

347
00:14:50,893 --> 00:14:52,019
Right.

348
00:14:52,095 --> 00:14:55,064
Kind of bloated but happy.

349
00:14:55,131 --> 00:14:57,565
- If you know what I mean.
- Yeah.

350
00:14:57,634 --> 00:15:00,501
It was an honor just to sit there
and inhale the same air...

351
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:03,630
that she had so recently exhaled...

352
00:15:03,706 --> 00:15:08,302
just to exchange the atmosphere
between us, so to speak.

353
00:15:08,378 --> 00:15:09,470
Look, what did she want?

354
00:15:09,545 --> 00:15:10,944
Did she say anything about...

355
00:15:11,014 --> 00:15:12,106
Who?

356
00:15:12,181 --> 00:15:13,773
The lady.

357
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:16,876
Oh. She was looking for
the Presbyterian Church.

358
00:15:16,953 --> 00:15:18,887
Like a dope,
I told her where it was.

359
00:15:18,955 --> 00:15:21,947
And out of my life she went, just as...

360
00:15:22,025 --> 00:15:24,619
quickly and erotically
as she had entered it.

361
00:15:28,665 --> 00:15:30,428
Are you tired
of your current herring?

362
00:15:32,301 --> 00:15:34,826
Has it lost that certain
something that you expect...

363
00:15:34,904 --> 00:15:36,235
in a pickled fish product?

364
00:15:38,274 --> 00:15:41,004
If so, maybe it's time you try Jens Jenson.

365
00:15:41,077 --> 00:15:46,379
It's the Lake Superior herring that's made
the old-fashioned Norwegian way.

366
00:15:54,357 --> 00:15:58,726
C-can someone turn it down, please?
Please?

367
00:15:58,795 --> 00:16:02,094
♪ Yeah, Jenson Herring is the best ♪

368
00:16:02,165 --> 00:16:03,331
Oh, Jens Jenson's.

369
00:16:03,366 --> 00:16:05,300
- Please.
- Ask for it by name.

370
00:16:05,368 --> 00:16:08,201
And if your grocer doesn't stock it,
ask him why not.

371
00:16:08,271 --> 00:16:09,863
You know what I'm gonna do?

372
00:16:09,939 --> 00:16:12,567
I'm gonna color my hair
strawberry blonde.

373
00:16:13,076 --> 00:16:13,804
Hey.

374
00:16:13,876 --> 00:16:16,242
I swear to God, I should
have done it years ago.

375
00:16:16,312 --> 00:16:17,279
I should have broke loose...

376
00:16:17,346 --> 00:16:19,678
gone to Chicago
when Mama died back then.

377
00:16:19,749 --> 00:16:21,239
That's what I should have done.

378
00:16:21,317 --> 00:16:23,080
You know, you put those things off.

379
00:16:23,152 --> 00:16:25,518
You seldom get around to them again.

380
00:16:25,588 --> 00:16:28,113
Hmm. What are you writin'?

381
00:16:28,191 --> 00:16:29,351
Poem.

382
00:16:29,425 --> 00:16:30,824
Oh, a poem.

383
00:16:30,893 --> 00:16:33,259
What's it about?

384
00:16:33,329 --> 00:16:34,853
Heh. Suicide.

385
00:16:34,931 --> 00:16:36,728
Oh, my God.

386
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:39,666
Oh. OK.

387
00:16:39,736 --> 00:16:42,000
Well, you know what my philosophy is.

388
00:16:42,071 --> 00:16:44,369
Yes, I do, so don't tell me.

389
00:16:45,908 --> 00:16:49,969
I think that you gotta be grateful
for everything that happens to you...

390
00:16:50,046 --> 00:16:52,776
because that's what
got you here, you know?

391
00:16:52,849 --> 00:16:55,682
And if you hadn't gone through
all the things that you went through...

392
00:16:55,752 --> 00:16:57,982
why, you know,
you wouldn't have wound up...

393
00:16:58,054 --> 00:17:01,854
where you are now, so,
I don't know.

394
00:17:01,924 --> 00:17:03,186
Disappointment doesn't
get you anywhere.

395
00:17:03,259 --> 00:17:04,226
Anywhere.

396
00:17:04,293 --> 00:17:05,885
Aren't you wonderful?

397
00:17:05,962 --> 00:17:09,193
Well, one door closes
and another one opens...

398
00:17:09,265 --> 00:17:13,793
then, you know, everything is
a step along the way...

399
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:15,838
and it all leads to something else.

400
00:17:15,905 --> 00:17:19,238
Pardon me if I don't
get down on my knees.

401
00:17:19,308 --> 00:17:22,607
Well, that's what I think.

402
00:17:22,678 --> 00:17:25,613
Ahem. Read me some of your poem.

403
00:17:25,681 --> 00:17:26,943
It's not finished.

404
00:17:27,016 --> 00:17:28,244
Huh?

405
00:17:28,317 --> 00:17:30,547
OK.

406
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:33,748
"Soliloquy for a Blue Guitar.

407
00:17:33,823 --> 00:17:34,790
"Death is easy...

408
00:17:34,857 --> 00:17:37,587
"like jumping into the big, blue air...

409
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,651
"and waving hello to God.

410
00:17:39,729 --> 00:17:40,787
"God is love...

drop everything...

412
00:17:42,498 --> 00:17:44,523
"to catch you, does he?

00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,660

"don't expect to wake up

415
00:17:50,406 --> 00:17:53,500
"The toast is you."

416
00:17:53,576 --> 00:17:55,601
Hey, what was
the name of that song?

417
00:17:55,678 --> 00:17:56,645
Well, did you like it?

418
00:17:56,712 --> 00:17:59,510
I won't be loanin' you my car
any time soon.

419
00:17:59,582 --> 00:18:01,379

Thank you so much.

421
00:18:02,752 --> 00:18:05,152

No, Mr. Noir.

And the next week, we're back
doin' the county fair circuit...

471
00:20:51,387 --> 00:20:53,446
changin' our petticoats
in the ladies' toilet...

472
00:20:53,522 --> 00:20:54,955

Ha ha ha!

That was the only
good part about it.

475
00:20:57,927 --> 00:21:00,122
Then you have to go outdoors
and sing in the open air...

476
00:21:00,196 --> 00:21:02,687
with a cloud of mosquitoes
around your head.

477
00:21:02,765 --> 00:21:06,064
Remember that time...
honestly, Lola, honest to God...

478
00:21:06,135 --> 00:21:07,932
a dragonfly flew right in my mouth.

479
00:21:08,004 --> 00:21:08,993
Oh, yeah!

480
00:21:09,071 --> 00:21:11,801
It was this big.
I thought it was a bird.

481
00:21:11,874 --> 00:21:12,863
How old were you then?

482
00:21:12,942 --> 00:21:15,672
I was thirteen.
Your mother was ten.

483
00:21:15,745 --> 00:21:16,939
Wanda was what?

484
00:21:17,013 --> 00:21:20,710
Wanda was sixteen.
Connie, fifteen.

485
00:21:20,783 --> 00:21:22,273
Yep.

486
00:21:22,351 --> 00:21:24,285
That was the end of it.
The end of the road.

487
00:21:24,353 --> 00:21:26,651
That was a great...

488
00:21:26,722 --> 00:21:29,020
You know, Wanda took it
real hard, didn't she?

489
00:21:29,091 --> 00:21:31,491
A week later, she got arrested.

490
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,790
For what?
You never told me this.

491
00:21:33,863 --> 00:21:36,161
Shoplifting, and I did tell you this.

492
00:21:36,232 --> 00:21:38,757
Mom, you're going senile.
You didn't tell me that.

493
00:21:38,834 --> 00:21:39,801
No...

494
00:21:39,869 --> 00:21:41,769
She was havin'
a cup of coffee in the cafe.

495
00:21:41,837 --> 00:21:43,099
She ordered a glazed doughnut.

496
00:21:43,172 --> 00:21:45,902
She started eatin' it
and she got a sugar rush.

497
00:21:45,975 --> 00:21:48,341
She was diagnosed hypoglycemic.

498
00:21:48,411 --> 00:21:50,379
And so, she forgets
she didn't pay for the doughnut...

499
00:21:50,446 --> 00:21:51,606
and she walks out the door.

500
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,614
- It wasn't two minutes...
- But they arrested her for shopliftin'.

501
00:21:53,682 --> 00:21:56,549
The red lights are flashin'
and she's in handcuffs...

502
00:21:56,619 --> 00:21:58,211
- And they had a policeman there.
- And the cameras, the TV camera...

503
00:21:58,287 --> 00:22:00,619
- the station came right down.
- It was on the news.

504
00:22:00,689 --> 00:22:02,919
And her hair is, like, stickin' out like this
and she's bawlin'...

505
00:22:02,992 --> 00:22:05,085
and Daddy sees it
on the 10:00 newscast.

506
00:22:05,161 --> 00:22:07,026
'Cause he was
in the hospital with Mama.

507
00:22:07,096 --> 00:22:09,587
She was havin' her tubes tied
after Johnny was born.

508
00:22:09,665 --> 00:22:10,632
Thank you.

509
00:22:10,699 --> 00:22:13,099
- Didn't need to know that.
- Well.

510
00:22:13,169 --> 00:22:17,663
Daddy sees Wanda gettin' arrested
on TV for shoplifting.

511
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,640
He has a major coronary occlusion.

512
00:22:19,708 --> 00:22:20,834
Yeah.

513
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:23,777
He just climbed up into
the hospital bed with Mama...

514
00:22:23,846 --> 00:22:26,474
then he pulled the sheet
up over his own face...

515
00:22:26,549 --> 00:22:28,483
and when the nurse came in,
he was dead.

516
00:22:28,551 --> 00:22:30,815
That was it.
You know?

517
00:22:30,886 --> 00:22:34,617
He left a note, 'cause Wanda got
released from jail just for the funeral.

518
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:38,182
He said, "Wanda, you broke my heart.
Signed, Daddy."

519
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:41,252
She did thirty days
for one glazed doughnut.

520
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:44,493
A 59-cent doughnut.
If it had been rock and roll...

521
00:22:44,567 --> 00:22:46,501
she could have
thrown sofas out of the window...

522
00:22:46,569 --> 00:22:48,730
hotel window.
No, not even her own sofa.

523
00:22:48,804 --> 00:22:51,272
She could throw somebody else's sofa
out the window.

524
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,467
You don't know what kind
of passersby at the bottom.

525
00:22:53,542 --> 00:22:55,476
She could have been hittin' people.
It wouldn't have mattered.

526
00:22:55,544 --> 00:22:58,479
But when you're playin' to
Christian family audiences like we were...

527
00:22:58,547 --> 00:23:00,538
you so much as forget to pay
for a damn doughnut...

528
00:23:00,616 --> 00:23:02,777
they throw you out like
a piece of garbage.

529
00:23:02,852 --> 00:23:05,582
Sooner kill you than look at you.

530
00:23:05,654 --> 00:23:07,747
Some of those good people, eh?

531
00:23:07,823 --> 00:23:11,315
The Soderberg family selling out!

532
00:23:11,393 --> 00:23:13,657
I just do not get it.

533
00:23:13,729 --> 00:23:15,356
I mean, they've owned WLT...

534
00:23:15,431 --> 00:23:17,865
since they ran it
out of a sandwich shop.

535
00:23:17,933 --> 00:23:19,833
I mean, that's what the call letters
stand for, you know.

536
00:23:19,902 --> 00:23:22,166
"With Lettuce and Tomato."
Did you know that?

537
00:23:22,238 --> 00:23:24,399
I mean, how do you just walk away
from somethin' like that?

538
00:23:24,473 --> 00:23:26,202
I mean, what are we?
Used Kleenex?

539
00:23:26,275 --> 00:23:28,300
They got old, babe.

540
00:23:28,377 --> 00:23:31,574
They started thinking
about ease and comfort.

541
00:23:31,647 --> 00:23:36,744
Then, I figure, they saw a brochure
about an island with palm trees...

542
00:23:36,819 --> 00:23:40,915
and an azure sky
and miles of sand...

543
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:43,151
and they thought, "Hey! Ha ha!

544
00:23:43,225 --> 00:23:47,662
"We don't have to suffer through
these miserable Minnesota winters.

545
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:51,166
"We don't have to freeze our butts off
waiting for our bus to come.

546
00:23:51,233 --> 00:23:55,932
"Our bus has come. It's here.
We'll leave the business to the kids...

547
00:23:56,005 --> 00:23:58,701
"and we'll head for paradise
and to hell with it."

548
00:23:58,774 --> 00:23:59,741
Only trouble is...

549
00:23:59,808 --> 00:24:03,244
the kids had already gone down
to paradise ahead of them.

550
00:24:03,312 --> 00:24:05,780
So then, a big corporation
down in Texas...

551
00:24:05,848 --> 00:24:08,874
offered them
a gazillion dollars for it.

552
00:24:08,951 --> 00:24:10,816
Texans.

553
00:24:10,886 --> 00:24:12,444
Sure.

554
00:24:12,521 --> 00:24:14,318
They talk funny
and their eyes don't focus...

555
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:17,359
and their flesh is rotting
and falling off...

556
00:24:17,426 --> 00:24:21,556
but hey. You know. So what?

557
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:25,999
Yeah, nobody's perfect and, uh...
money is money...

558
00:24:26,068 --> 00:24:28,536
so, the Soderbergs took the dough.
End of story.

559
00:24:28,604 --> 00:24:30,196
Do you have any tweezers?

560
00:24:30,272 --> 00:24:33,605
Egg salad or ham salad?

561
00:24:33,676 --> 00:24:35,303
Why are you crying?

562
00:24:35,377 --> 00:24:37,937
Well, it's the last show.

563
00:24:38,013 --> 00:24:41,642
I'm never going to see
these people again.

564
00:24:41,717 --> 00:24:42,809
You'll see them again.

565
00:24:42,885 --> 00:24:45,752
I knew all of them from the old days.

566
00:24:45,821 --> 00:24:49,814
Soupy and Red, Ray.

567
00:24:49,892 --> 00:24:52,588
And Helen.

568
00:24:52,661 --> 00:24:54,856
Gone and forgotten.

569
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:57,194
Every sparrow is remembered.

570
00:24:59,969 --> 00:25:03,405
I don't even know if they're gonna
make a speech or anything.

571
00:25:03,472 --> 00:25:05,770
It doesn't seem right, does it?

572
00:25:05,841 --> 00:25:06,808
No.

573
00:25:06,875 --> 00:25:11,039
Some big company come in
and steps on us...

574
00:25:11,113 --> 00:25:13,445
like we were bugs at the picnic.

575
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:20,989
What's in ham salad?

576
00:25:21,056 --> 00:25:25,925
I... I can't remember the word. It was...

577
00:25:25,995 --> 00:25:28,361
May I...

578
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:30,227
Maybe...

579
00:25:30,299 --> 00:25:31,266
Mayo?

580
00:25:31,333 --> 00:25:34,791
Mayonnaise.

581
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:36,531
Mayonnaise.

582
00:25:36,605 --> 00:25:40,905
Well, it's an end of an era
when this show goes, guys.

583
00:25:40,976 --> 00:25:43,001
There won't be anything left
on the radio except what?

584
00:25:43,078 --> 00:25:45,774
People yellin' at you
and computers playing music.

585
00:25:45,848 --> 00:25:47,372
I mean, it's a tragedy.

586
00:25:47,449 --> 00:25:48,507
I wasn't gonna tell you this...

587
00:25:48,584 --> 00:25:51,109
but between you and me
and the fly on the wall...

588
00:25:51,186 --> 00:25:54,519
there's a woman on the premises who
I think, maybe, is gonna save our bacon.

589
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:55,579
Hmm?

590
00:25:55,658 --> 00:25:57,057
She's got that look about her.

591
00:25:57,126 --> 00:25:58,115
Who is she?

592
00:25:58,193 --> 00:26:00,889
I'm not sure. I'm still working
on figuring that one out.

593
00:26:00,963 --> 00:26:02,828
Just close your eyes
for a second.

594
00:26:02,898 --> 00:26:04,695
She from NorComm?

595
00:26:04,767 --> 00:26:05,995
Time will tell.

596
00:26:06,068 --> 00:26:11,005
I'll just let personal charm
and dashing good looks do their work.

597
00:26:11,073 --> 00:26:13,337
She walked in,
couldn't take her eyes off me.

598
00:26:13,409 --> 00:26:16,071
Drawn to me like a moth to the flame.

599
00:26:16,312 --> 00:26:18,246
Every time there's
a triumph in the world...

600
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,942
a million souls have to be trampled on.

601
00:26:21,016 --> 00:26:23,780
And right there... you can see it
right in the damn carpet.

602
00:26:23,852 --> 00:26:26,252
What does that have
to do with anything?

603
00:26:26,322 --> 00:26:28,222
Mama. She I... she went...

604
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:29,450
She went up to the...

605
00:26:29,525 --> 00:26:31,584
It was a lot for Mama to put up with.

606
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,958
We had to shovel her into
the Good Shepherd Home.

607
00:26:34,029 --> 00:26:35,826
That's it.
That was the sad day.

608
00:26:35,898 --> 00:26:37,365
Connie quit the act.

609
00:26:37,433 --> 00:26:39,060
God, we'd already lost Wanda.

610
00:26:39,134 --> 00:26:40,362
Wanda was like magic.

611
00:26:40,436 --> 00:26:42,199
The four of us,
when we were together...

612
00:26:42,271 --> 00:26:43,533
- she was singin'.
- She was...

613
00:26:43,605 --> 00:26:45,436
And next to you, I'm tellin' you...

614
00:26:45,507 --> 00:26:46,769
you've followed in her footsteps.

615
00:26:46,842 --> 00:26:49,037
You are the same...
the same talent.

616
00:26:49,111 --> 00:26:50,476
No. I don't know about that.

617
00:26:50,546 --> 00:26:51,808
So, now, it's just the two of us.

618
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,313
Yep. Just the two of us.

619
00:26:53,382 --> 00:26:56,613
You know what?
It was your dad got us on the radio.

620
00:26:56,685 --> 00:26:59,176
God, that was
a good-lookin' family!

621
00:26:59,254 --> 00:27:01,188
I can understand you
goin' for that guy.

622
00:27:01,256 --> 00:27:03,190
Yeah, he sang like an angel.

623
00:27:03,258 --> 00:27:05,886

00:29:59,668 --> 00:30:01,693
and people can see his crack...

684
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:04,864
and it ain't nothin' any normal person
would ever care to look at?

685
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:05,929
Where?

686
00:30:06,008 --> 00:30:08,533

Well, I don't see nothin'.

- Don't talk to me.

00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,340
Am I decent back there?

690
00:30:13,415 --> 00:30:15,747
Don't ask me.
I'm not your mother.

691
00:30:15,817 --> 00:30:18,752
You might be decent
if you lost 25 pounds of ugly fat.

692
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:21,687
And I might suggest
cuttin' off your head.

693
00:30:21,757 --> 00:30:24,021
She showed me her tattoo once.

694
00:30:24,092 --> 00:30:25,457
Hell she did.

695
00:30:25,527 --> 00:30:27,290
On her shoulder.

696
00:30:27,362 --> 00:30:28,989
You're lyin' through your teeth.

697
00:30:29,064 --> 00:30:30,190
Left shoulder.
Right here.

698
00:30:30,265 --> 00:30:32,199
- That ain't the shoulder.
- Whatever you want to call it.

699
00:30:32,267 --> 00:30:33,291
I'd call it the clavicle.

700
00:30:33,368 --> 00:30:34,528
OK, well, why don't you
ask her about it?

701
00:30:34,603 --> 00:30:35,695
Maybe she'll let you have a look.

702
00:30:35,771 --> 00:30:37,363
Well, what did it say?

703
00:30:37,439 --> 00:30:38,633
It said, "Freedom."

704
00:30:38,707 --> 00:30:40,641
Fr... Now I know you're lyin'.

705
00:30:40,709 --> 00:30:43,143
Come on. We gotta put out the CDs.

706
00:30:43,211 --> 00:30:45,941
Come on, niece.

707
00:30:46,014 --> 00:30:48,005
Hey. Molly.

708
00:30:48,083 --> 00:30:49,983
Molly, here.
Take these out front.

709
00:30:50,052 --> 00:30:53,852
Did you hear about the Soderbergs
sellin' the radio station?

710
00:30:53,922 --> 00:30:56,049
I heard all about it.

711
00:30:56,124 --> 00:30:57,523
Are you OK?

712
00:30:57,593 --> 00:31:00,653
Yes, of course.
Hmm?

713
00:31:00,729 --> 00:31:02,629
Kind of a bizarre feeling, isn't it?

714
00:31:02,698 --> 00:31:04,962
- What?
- The silence.

715
00:31:05,033 --> 00:31:06,898
What?

716
00:31:06,969 --> 00:31:08,994
Well...

717
00:31:09,071 --> 00:31:10,561
you're gonna say somethin' about it.

718
00:31:10,639 --> 00:31:12,038
You're gonna talk
to the people, aren't you?

719
00:31:12,107 --> 00:31:14,871
Say, "Thanks for listening,"
or something.

720
00:31:14,943 --> 00:31:16,137
Yeah, you know.

721
00:31:16,211 --> 00:31:17,200
I don't think so.

722
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:18,405
Why not?
Say, "Thank you."

723
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,141
What?

724
00:31:20,215 --> 00:31:22,581
I'm just not into making big speeches.

725
00:31:22,651 --> 00:31:23,879
What do you do when you
leave somebody's house?

726
00:31:23,952 --> 00:31:25,044
You don't just turn around...

727
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,748
I don't make a big speech.
A big weepy speech.

728
00:31:27,823 --> 00:31:31,691
Oh, that's it!
You're afraid that you're gonna cry!

729
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,022
I wouldn't.

730
00:31:33,095 --> 00:31:36,087
Yeah, that's right.
That's true. You wouldn't.

731
00:31:36,164 --> 00:31:40,100
And you know, that's why, I think,
that our romance was so short.

732
00:31:40,168 --> 00:31:43,296
Because I knew that when we broke up,
you would not cry...

733
00:31:43,372 --> 00:31:45,340
so, I got way over it.

734
00:31:47,209 --> 00:31:48,301
Does that make sense to you?

735
00:31:48,377 --> 00:31:49,344
No, not at all.

Rhonda and Yolanda.

751
00:32:30,018 --> 00:32:31,815
- Hi, everybody.
- Hi.

752
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:35,456
Oh, thank you. Thank you!
Thank you very much.

753
00:32:35,524 --> 00:32:39,051
I just want to say right away
how happy I am...

754
00:32:39,127 --> 00:32:42,688
that my daughter Lola
is here tonight.

755
00:32:42,764 --> 00:32:44,095
- Come on, Lola.
- Oh! Thank you, sweetheart.

756
00:32:44,166 --> 00:32:45,190
They want to see you.

757
00:32:45,267 --> 00:32:47,292
It means a lot to me that you came.

758
00:32:47,369 --> 00:32:50,736
Yeah, I named my little girl Lola
after our own mother.

759
00:32:50,806 --> 00:32:51,830
Yeah, Lola was our mom.

760
00:32:51,907 --> 00:32:56,742
Lola. And tonight,
we're gonna sing...

761
00:32:56,812 --> 00:32:59,975
an old song that our mother loved.

762
00:33:00,048 --> 00:33:01,310
Oh, it's one of her favorites.

763
00:33:01,383 --> 00:33:04,375
Yep. She was our inspiration.

764
00:33:04,453 --> 00:33:05,750
Some of you know this story...

765
00:33:05,821 --> 00:33:10,918
but she's the main reason
that we started makin' music originally...

766
00:33:10,992 --> 00:33:14,792
because you know she...

767
00:33:14,863 --> 00:33:17,423
it was the only way we knew
to make her happy.

768
00:33:17,499 --> 00:33:21,299
She'd be down on the kitchen floor
scrubbin' on her knees.

769
00:33:21,369 --> 00:33:24,532
But if you stood in the doorway
and you sang a song that she liked...

770
00:33:24,606 --> 00:33:27,575
why, she would just look up and smile.

771
00:33:27,642 --> 00:33:30,338
Ha ha!
Worn out as she was...

772
00:33:30,412 --> 00:33:34,109
it was a smile as wide
as the Mississippi. Heh heh.

773
00:33:36,151 --> 00:33:37,118
Down at the mouth.

774
00:33:37,185 --> 00:33:39,779

00:38:53,401 --> 00:38:54,925
Well, it sure would mean
the world to your mom.

871
00:38:55,003 --> 00:38:56,470
She always said you had talent.

872
00:38:56,538 --> 00:38:59,006
Yeah, I don't... I don't really know
any of their songs.

873
00:38:59,074 --> 00:39:00,473
I only know my own songs.

874
00:39:00,542 --> 00:39:02,009
Well, sing one of them then.

875
00:39:02,077 --> 00:39:04,272
They're mostly about death.

876
00:39:04,345 --> 00:39:05,937
Oh.

877
00:39:06,014 --> 00:39:08,482
Well, lotta good songs about death.

878
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:10,848
All mine are about suicide.

879
00:39:10,919 --> 00:39:12,716
Oh.

880
00:39:12,787 --> 00:39:16,518
Yeah, you know, um,
hangin' yourself with an extension cord...

881
00:39:16,591 --> 00:39:19,355
- carbon monoxide, overdose...
- Hey, ahem...

882
00:39:19,427 --> 00:39:23,193
you know, we could do, uh,
Amazing Grace together.

883
00:39:23,264 --> 00:39:24,424
I know Amazing Grace.

884
00:39:24,499 --> 00:39:25,727
Yeah?
Well, hey, look.

885
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,734
I'll play the guitar,
we'll sing it together...

886
00:39:27,802 --> 00:39:28,769
we'll bring this house down.

887
00:39:28,837 --> 00:39:29,804
You know, I don't know
if you knew this...

888
00:39:29,871 --> 00:39:31,771
- about my friend Dusty here...
- Hey, hey.

889
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,604
But he learned to sing gospel music
in San Quentin.

890
00:39:34,676 --> 00:39:35,904
And full shush.

891
00:39:35,977 --> 00:39:36,966
Yes sir, that's where I met him.

892
00:39:37,045 --> 00:39:38,569
I was with Johnny Cash,
singin' in prisons.

893
00:39:38,646 --> 00:39:39,704
Shut the pie hole.

894
00:39:39,781 --> 00:39:41,214
There were all these
heinous, depraved criminals...

895
00:39:41,282 --> 00:39:43,307
- And well...
- Liar, liar. Whatever, moron.

896
00:39:43,384 --> 00:39:44,476
He sang Amazing Grace...

897
00:39:44,552 --> 00:39:47,214
and it almost made you forget
what he'd done.

898
00:39:47,288 --> 00:39:48,755
Which I don't wanna talk about.

899
00:39:48,823 --> 00:39:51,257
You know, you are so dumb,
you may be twins.

900
00:39:51,326 --> 00:39:53,954
He made me promise on a Bible
that I would never tell, and I won't.

901
00:39:54,028 --> 00:39:56,258
So let that be the end of it.
Let me just say this, though.

902
00:39:56,331 --> 00:39:58,026
Watch out for hugs.

903
00:39:59,367 --> 00:40:00,561
Heh!

904
00:40:00,635 --> 00:40:01,897

Thank you, G.K.

Thank you, Chuck.

916
00:40:30,031 --> 00:40:31,623
Robin and Linda Williams.

917
00:40:32,033 --> 00:40:33,864
Let's come in here now
with a word about ketchup.

918
00:40:33,935 --> 00:40:37,928
Yes, ketchup, made from tomatoes
that contain natural sunshine...

919
00:40:38,006 --> 00:40:40,440
which we need in this part
of the country.

920
00:40:40,508 --> 00:40:41,941
We are not a sunshiny people.

921
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:44,308
We're not a paradise people
or a beach people.

922
00:40:44,379 --> 00:40:45,869
We are dark people.

923
00:40:45,947 --> 00:40:48,108
People who believed it could be worse.

924
00:40:48,183 --> 00:40:50,413
And we're waiting
for it to become worse.

925
00:40:50,485 --> 00:40:52,953
We come from people
who brought us up to believe...

926
00:40:53,021 --> 00:40:55,080
that life is a struggle...

927
00:40:55,156 --> 00:40:57,283
and if you should
ever feel really happy...

928
00:40:57,358 --> 00:40:59,690
be patient. This will pass.

929
00:40:59,761 --> 00:41:00,921
- Ha ha ha.
- So we could...

930
00:41:00,995 --> 00:41:01,962
When do you guys go on?

931
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:06,330
As soon as ol' spud butt here
shuts his yapper.

932
00:41:06,401 --> 00:41:07,595
Thanks for the encouragement.

933
00:41:07,669 --> 00:41:09,637
Hey, you are gonna be great.
Give me a hug.

934
00:41:09,704 --> 00:41:10,432
All right, guys.

935
00:41:10,738 --> 00:41:11,966
More show in just a moment...

936
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,634
but let's come in here now
with a word about shoes!

937
00:41:14,709 --> 00:41:16,836
That's Guy's Shoes. Boys...

938
00:41:16,911 --> 00:41:19,311

945
00:41:33,895 --> 00:41:35,829
Yes, Guy's Shoes.
They're made to last.

946
00:41:35,897 --> 00:41:38,866
Ask about those Guy's Cash Shoes,
with the hole in the soles...

947
00:41:38,933 --> 00:41:41,834
so you stash your cash
when you're out on the trail.

948
00:41:41,903 --> 00:41:43,029
Isn't that right, Lefty?

949
00:41:43,104 --> 00:41:44,401
That's where I keep mine, G.K.

950
00:41:44,472 --> 00:41:45,837
All right.
Let's welcome 'em now...

951
00:41:45,907 --> 00:41:47,397
the old trail hands here...

952
00:41:47,475 --> 00:41:50,911
the Pachelbels of the prairie,
the Brahmses of the bunkhouse...

953
00:41:50,979 --> 00:41:52,674
here they are,
Dusty and Lefty.

954
00:41:52,747 --> 00:41:54,681
- Good to have you with us.
- Well, thank you, Garrison.

955
00:41:54,749 --> 00:41:56,376
Yes sir, it's good to be back on the show...

956
00:41:56,451 --> 00:41:59,284
because, you know, it gets
mighty lonesome out there on the prairie.

957
00:41:59,354 --> 00:42:01,982
And a cowboy gets
tired of scenery after a while.

958
00:42:02,056 --> 00:42:05,116
You get, well,
sceneried out, and uh...

959
00:42:05,193 --> 00:42:08,651
sort of wish you had
somebody to talk to.

960
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:09,697
Somebody smart.

961
00:42:09,764 --> 00:42:10,731
- Hmm.
- Ha ha ha.

962
00:42:10,798 --> 00:42:14,290
So you're lonesome for people, huh?

963
00:42:14,369 --> 00:42:16,200
Well, you know, it's true, Garrison.

964
00:42:16,271 --> 00:42:19,707
And, uh, it-it ain't the same
just talkin' to your horse.

965
00:42:19,774 --> 00:42:21,537
My horse is extremely smart.

966
00:42:21,609 --> 00:42:23,907
Uh, he knows math.

967
00:42:23,978 --> 00:42:26,538
He knows physics and chemistry...

968
00:42:26,614 --> 00:42:28,844
but I can't seem
to teach him philosophy.

969
00:42:28,916 --> 00:42:30,543
Can't teach him philosophy, eh?

970
00:42:30,618 --> 00:42:32,882
Well, no. You can't put Descartes
before the horse.

971
00:42:32,954 --> 00:42:33,921
- Aw...
- Ha ha ha.

972
00:42:33,988 --> 00:42:35,114
That was a good one, you know?

973
00:42:36,291 --> 00:42:38,555
Well, what do you reckon
we sing a song, Dusty?

974
00:42:38,626 --> 00:42:39,888
Well, let's do it, Lefty.

975
00:42:39,961 --> 00:42:41,861

So my mom said, um...

996
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:31,510
my mom said, you got into radio...

997
00:43:31,579 --> 00:43:35,481
uh, when someone was flying a kite
whose clothes came off? Ha.

998
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:37,643
A naked man flying.
Quite a sight.

999
00:43:37,719 --> 00:43:39,619
Why didn't he pull his shorts up?

1000
00:43:41,055 --> 00:43:44,047
He was hanging on to the kite,
couldn't let go.

1001
00:43:44,125 --> 00:43:45,752
- He was up high.
- Ha.

1002
00:43:45,827 --> 00:43:47,795
A hundred feet up in the air...

1003
00:43:47,862 --> 00:43:49,454
fifty.

1004
00:43:49,530 --> 00:43:50,895
Ha.

1005
00:43:50,965 --> 00:43:53,092
So, how did that get you into radio?

1006
00:43:53,167 --> 00:43:55,362
Well, that was how I met your dad.

1007
00:43:56,404 --> 00:43:57,530
Here comes the solo.

1008
00:44:07,014 --> 00:44:09,039
Yeah, real good.
Real good.

1009
00:44:09,117 --> 00:44:10,641
- Wait, naked guy...
- Yeah?

1010
00:44:10,718 --> 00:44:11,946
- Was my dad?
- Right.

1011
00:44:12,019 --> 00:44:13,350
Ha.

1012
00:44:13,421 --> 00:44:17,187
Naked man with red swim trunks
around his ankles.

1013
00:44:17,258 --> 00:44:18,953
Couple thousand people saw it...

1014
00:44:19,026 --> 00:44:21,324
so we figured it was a good time
to leave town...

1015
00:44:21,396 --> 00:44:24,957
so we got a car,
and we headed down to Chicago.

1030
00:44:54,796 --> 00:44:56,491
I go in to pay for the gas...

1031
00:44:56,531 --> 00:44:59,364
and he wakes up and decides
he needs to use the men's room.

1032
00:44:59,434 --> 00:45:01,265
So I come back.

1033
00:45:01,335 --> 00:45:03,803
I think he's still sleeping
in the back seat...

1034
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:07,807
and I get behind the wheel,
and I drive to Chicago.

1035
00:45:07,875 --> 00:45:09,206
I leave him there in Oshkosh.

1036
00:45:09,277 --> 00:45:14,510
And he goes into the café,
and your mother was the waitress.

1037
00:45:14,582 --> 00:45:15,606
That's how they met.

1038
00:45:15,683 --> 00:45:17,776
That's how I came to be born.

1039
00:45:17,852 --> 00:45:21,253
Well, it kind of led to that, yeah.

1040
00:45:21,322 --> 00:45:23,552
Yeah, but I mean if you had
looked in the back seat...

1041
00:45:23,624 --> 00:45:26,218
and... and seen that he wasn't there,
I wouldn't exist.

1042
00:45:26,294 --> 00:45:31,061
Well, he and I weren't getting along
that well, so that's why.

1043
00:45:32,467 --> 00:45:33,559
That's really strange.

1044
00:45:33,634 --> 00:45:36,967
Well, no. I think it's one...

1045
00:45:37,038 --> 00:45:39,529
of the most beautiful things
I ever did not do.

1046
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:45,838
So how'd you get into radio then?

1047
00:45:45,913 --> 00:45:48,848
Well, there was a show called, uh,
The Baked Bean Jubilee.

1048
00:45:48,916 --> 00:45:50,850
- Yeah, with my dad.

Here's a little note here from Aaron...

1068
00:46:51,312 --> 00:46:53,542
who says our show is a source
of comfort and laughter for him.

1069
00:46:53,614 --> 00:46:55,946

- And he's hopin' that the Johnson Girls...

1072
00:46:59,954 --> 00:47:01,888
No, he was just joking, he says.

1073
00:47:01,956 --> 00:47:03,048
Just joking about that.

1074
00:47:03,124 --> 00:47:06,150
He was hoping that we would sing, uh,
Gold Watch and Chain.

1075
00:47:06,227 --> 00:47:07,387
- Oh. Oh, I bet.
- Yolanda.

You are fat.

1092
00:48:06,554 --> 00:48:12,015

on the, um, desserts and the beer.

1093
00:48:12,093 --> 00:48:15,119

That reminds me.

1111
00:49:07,148 --> 00:49:09,639
About that obscene song
you sang last week.

1112
00:49:09,717 --> 00:49:11,412
- Obscene? Uh...
- Yeah.

1113
00:49:11,485 --> 00:49:14,079
"I'll give you my moonshine
if you show me your jugs"?

1114
00:49:14,155 --> 00:49:16,180
No, not that one.

1115
00:49:16,257 --> 00:49:18,487
"Lovin' you ain't easy,
but I hear your sister is"?

1116
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:20,891
No, no, no.
"Come ride my pony all night long.

1117
00:49:20,961 --> 00:49:23,122
"Come ride him bareback,
I'll sing you a song." That one.

1118
00:49:23,197 --> 00:49:24,892
That's just a song
about ridin' a pony.

1119
00:49:24,965 --> 00:49:26,865
Mmm.

1120
00:49:26,934 --> 00:49:28,902

1122
00:49:31,138 --> 00:49:32,230
What do you say?

1123
00:49:32,306 --> 00:49:33,933
"Go out"?
What do you mean?

1124
00:49:34,008 --> 00:49:35,100

Thank you, Yolanda.

1144
00:50:34,034 --> 00:50:35,797
What a beautiful, beautiful song.

1145
00:50:35,870 --> 00:50:37,861
This portion of our show
is brought to you...

1146
00:50:37,938 --> 00:50:39,599
by Powdermilk Biscuits...

1147
00:50:39,673 --> 00:50:42,767
and also brought to you by duct tape.

1148
00:50:42,843 --> 00:50:44,470
Duct tape.
Yes, duct tape.

1149
00:50:44,545 --> 00:50:46,843
Duct tape.

1150
00:50:46,914 --> 00:50:49,075
Useful thing around the household...

1151
00:50:49,150 --> 00:50:52,210
almost anything that comes
up around the household.

1152
00:50:52,286 --> 00:50:55,255
Sometimes you need to make repairs,
doors come loose...

1153
00:50:55,322 --> 00:50:58,189
and windows,
all sorts of things can happen.

1154
00:50:58,259 --> 00:51:02,389
Sometimes you just forget something
that you're looking for...

1155
00:51:02,463 --> 00:51:04,260
and duct tape can come in handy.

1156
00:51:04,331 --> 00:51:07,767
You can wrap it around your finger
like a string or something.

1157
00:51:07,835 --> 00:51:09,325
You can just tape it up.
Whatever.

1158
00:51:09,403 --> 00:51:10,893
Things do tend to fall apart, you know.

1159
00:51:10,971 --> 00:51:15,135
Confusion reins endemic
in our world today.

1160
00:51:15,209 --> 00:51:17,143
- Just things tend to drift...
- Oh, jeez.

1161
00:51:17,211 --> 00:51:19,645
And especially as you get to be older...

1162
00:51:19,713 --> 00:51:21,806
duct tape is
the most useful thing you'll find.

1163
00:51:21,882 --> 00:51:24,407
All repairs are short term.
We know that.

1164
00:51:24,485 --> 00:51:28,819
Say a faucet should be dripping
and you, and you...

1165
00:51:29,590 --> 00:51:32,115
The water is falling there,
dripping onto your cupboard...

1166
00:51:32,193 --> 00:51:35,287
and the... and the wood
comes loose from the wall...

1167
00:51:35,362 --> 00:51:37,125
and you need something to fix it.

1168
00:51:37,198 --> 00:51:39,792
Just reach for a roll of duct tape.

1169
00:51:39,867 --> 00:51:42,097
That would be the... the perfect thing.

1170
00:51:42,169 --> 00:51:45,263
Or maybe your orangutano's
been jumpin' up and down on it.

1171
00:51:46,974 --> 00:51:49,374
The weight of the orangutan has,
like, you know, crushed...

1172
00:51:49,443 --> 00:51:50,876
uh, crushed part of the counter.

1173
00:51:50,945 --> 00:51:52,537
And... and then your Rottweiler...

1174
00:51:52,613 --> 00:51:55,173
he comes runnin' out and
he bites the orangutan in the hinder.

1175
00:51:55,249 --> 00:51:56,944
Gets him all riled up.

1176
00:51:57,651 --> 00:51:58,618
Hey.

1177
00:51:58,686 --> 00:52:01,177
The Rottweiler, actually,
is locked in the basement.

1178
00:52:01,255 --> 00:52:02,222
Sorry to correct you there, Rhonda.

1179
00:52:02,289 --> 00:52:03,347
I can hear them goin' at it.

1180
00:52:03,424 --> 00:52:05,688
- He's down locked in the basement.
- The Rottweiler and the orangutan.

1181
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:06,851
A double lock there.

1182
00:52:06,927 --> 00:52:08,417
Because the...
uh, the orangutan, you know...

1183
00:52:08,495 --> 00:52:11,055
They got, uh, the fingers
and he's got a saw.

1184
00:52:12,766 --> 00:52:14,358
A chainsaw.

1185
00:52:15,603 --> 00:52:18,037
He cut a big hole in the door
and the Rottweiler got out.

1186
00:52:18,105 --> 00:52:20,733
That's how he bit the orangutan
in the hinder.

1187
00:52:22,910 --> 00:52:25,242
And then... and then
don't forget about the peacock.

1188
00:52:27,281 --> 00:52:29,272
And then the flock.
Uh, overhead there was...

1189
00:52:29,350 --> 00:52:31,250
a big helicopter
came flyin' through.

1190
00:52:33,287 --> 00:52:35,346
Right through a flock
of Canadian geese.

1191
00:52:37,091 --> 00:52:40,151
And, uh, really was gettin'
someone's goose was cooked.

1192
00:52:40,227 --> 00:52:41,285
And then they startled the peacock.

1193
00:52:43,097 --> 00:52:44,189
Yeah! Then...

1194
00:52:44,265 --> 00:52:45,357
And then this... this sick...

1195
00:52:45,432 --> 00:52:46,524
- The peacock.
- No, wait.

1196
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:50,468
This sadist... this sadist in uh, sneakers
was creepin' up on everybody.

1197
00:52:50,537 --> 00:52:54,735
And the peacock, he... uh...
he jumps right at the orangutan.

1198
00:52:54,808 --> 00:52:57,038
His beak...

1199
00:52:57,111 --> 00:53:01,013
yeah... is flashing like a scimitar.

1200
00:53:01,081 --> 00:53:05,245
Yeah, but the, uh, but his aim is...
uh, goes awry and it... and then, um...

1201
00:53:05,319 --> 00:53:06,547
He takes that chainsaw and he throws it.

1202
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:09,020
The orangutan throws it
at the peacock.

1203
00:53:09,089 --> 00:53:10,454
But he's got a bad aim.
The aim.

1204
00:53:10,524 --> 00:53:13,084
It goes right through a plate-glass window.

1205
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:14,252
But it almost...

1206
00:53:15,829 --> 00:53:17,319
Yeah... hits the mailman.

1207
00:53:17,398 --> 00:53:18,490
Wow! Oh!

1208
00:53:18,565 --> 00:53:22,092
Murray. But doesn't.
It misses him by inches.

1209
00:53:22,169 --> 00:53:27,334
And by the way, he's bringin' you a letter
from your ex-girlfriend. Remember her?

1210
00:53:27,408 --> 00:53:30,809
Who is still furious at you
for having dumped her.

1211
00:53:30,878 --> 00:53:35,212
You know, just thrown her aside,
the woman who loved you.

1212
00:53:35,282 --> 00:53:36,544
Just because
you found somebody new.

1213
00:53:36,617 --> 00:53:38,278
How could you do that?

1214
00:53:38,352 --> 00:53:42,049
She will never understand.
And, um...

1215
00:53:42,122 --> 00:53:44,784
duct tape isn't gonna
help you with that one bit.

1216
00:53:44,858 --> 00:53:46,052
No, I suppose not, but with two out of...

1217
00:53:46,126 --> 00:53:48,321
And duct tape is not gonna make
an honest man out of you.

1218
00:53:49,496 --> 00:53:53,227
No, it won't. But with two out of three
chores around the home, duct tape.

1219
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:55,131
And it isn't even gonna help you
find whatever it was...

1220
00:53:55,202 --> 00:53:57,796
you were lookin' for, so...
what were you lookin' for?

1221
00:53:57,871 --> 00:53:59,361
I was lookin' for duct tape.
Duct tape.

1222
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:01,374
All repairs are temporary and short term.

1223
00:54:01,442 --> 00:54:02,568
It's almost just about the only thing...

1224
00:54:02,643 --> 00:54:06,272
that really works sometimes,
and that is duct tape.

1226
00:54:08,849 --> 00:54:12,250
right after we come in
with a word about coffee.

1227
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:16,050
Yes, Jearlyn,
nothing stimulates a person...

1228
00:54:16,123 --> 00:54:21,060
keeps you focused quite
like good old caffeine.

00:54:21,128 --> 00:54:22,220

And we'll right back
with more right after this.

1299
00:58:24,705 --> 00:58:27,936
Ladies and gentlemen, we are now
at nine minutes to broadcast, please.

1300
00:58:28,008 --> 00:58:29,100
Nine minutes.

1301
00:58:30,344 --> 00:58:32,471
Hey. No smokin', mister.

1302
00:58:34,181 --> 00:58:37,480
Chuck Akers is dead.
He's gone.

1303
00:58:38,585 --> 00:58:42,544
I don't follow your reasoning there.

1304
00:58:42,623 --> 00:58:44,818
I said Chuck is dead.

1305
00:58:46,493 --> 00:58:47,824
Who's dead?

1306
00:58:47,894 --> 00:58:49,191
Chuck.

1307
00:58:51,131 --> 00:58:52,257
When?

1308
00:58:52,332 --> 00:58:54,027
Now.

1309
00:58:54,101 --> 00:58:55,728
He just died now?

1310
00:58:55,802 --> 00:58:57,292
I don't know when the hell he died.

1311
00:58:57,371 --> 00:58:59,862
I wasn't there.

1312
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:01,965
What was the approximate
time of death?

1313
00:59:02,042 --> 00:59:04,636
Recent. Why don't you go
check it out for yourself.

1314
00:59:04,711 --> 00:59:06,008
He's in there.

1315
00:59:07,414 --> 00:59:10,076
Does anyone else know about this?

1316
00:59:10,150 --> 00:59:11,981
I have no idea.

1317
00:59:12,052 --> 00:59:14,077
Because if anyone else knows about this
and they're not saying anything...

1318
00:59:14,154 --> 00:59:15,314
I need to know about that.

1319
00:59:22,929 --> 00:59:24,055
Excuse me.

1320
00:59:32,105 --> 00:59:33,732
I used to listen to your show...

1321
00:59:35,609 --> 00:59:37,236
until I died.

1322
00:59:39,613 --> 00:59:41,581
My name was Lois Peterson.

1323
00:59:44,751 --> 00:59:46,616
I was driving up to this cabin up north...

1324
00:59:46,687 --> 00:59:50,350
and you were telling a story
and I was laughing.

1325
00:59:51,992 --> 00:59:55,860
And then the car skidded off the road
and into a ditch and it flipped.

1326
00:59:55,929 --> 00:59:59,023
And as it did, the thought occurred to me...

1327
00:59:59,099 --> 01:00:03,195
that the story just wasn't that funny.

1328
01:00:06,139 --> 01:00:08,107
And then...

1329
01:00:08,175 --> 01:00:15,308
I was standing in this tall grass
looking down at my own body.

1330
01:00:15,382 --> 01:00:16,474
Hmm.

1331
01:00:16,550 --> 01:00:18,347
So sorry.

1332
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:23,812
I was on my way to that cabin
to meet my lover Larry.

1333
01:00:23,890 --> 01:00:28,793
We had been planning it
for over two months.

1334
01:00:29,896 --> 01:00:36,529
And because of your story,
I lost control and I died.

1335
01:00:36,603 --> 01:00:38,730
- So...
- I'm so sorry.

1336
01:00:38,805 --> 01:00:41,467
So you killed me, in a way.

1337
01:00:41,541 --> 01:00:42,974
Isn't that interesting?

1338
01:00:44,177 --> 01:00:47,340
He's quite dead.

1339
01:00:47,414 --> 01:00:48,847
Just a half an hour ago
he was walkin' around...

1340
01:00:48,915 --> 01:00:51,850
exchangin' the gases
with the atmosphere.

1341
01:00:51,918 --> 01:00:53,783
Well, there's a lot more
out than in now.

1342
01:00:53,854 --> 01:00:55,219
We should call the cops.

1343
01:00:55,288 --> 01:00:56,380
No.

1344
01:00:56,456 --> 01:00:59,186
When the time is right,
I'll make the call.

1345
01:00:59,259 --> 01:01:00,351
You... just, um...

1346
01:01:00,427 --> 01:01:03,123
All right. We're at five minutes
from broadcast.

1347
01:01:03,196 --> 01:01:04,629
Don't talk about this to anyone.
All right?

1348
01:01:04,698 --> 01:01:06,495
Keep it under your hat.

1349
01:01:06,566 --> 01:01:07,658
Go about your business.

1350
01:01:12,038 --> 01:01:13,630
I'm gonna secure the area.

1351
01:01:13,707 --> 01:01:15,902
Let's get on with the show.

1352
01:01:15,976 --> 01:01:18,171
You gonna be all right?

1353
01:01:18,245 --> 01:01:19,542
Yeah, I'll be all right.

1354
01:01:23,483 --> 01:01:25,417
So you're really an angel?

1355
01:01:25,485 --> 01:01:26,918
Of course.

1356
01:01:26,987 --> 01:01:28,579
Hmm.

1357
01:01:28,655 --> 01:01:30,122
What do you do?

1358
01:01:30,190 --> 01:01:31,282
Well, that's a dumb question.

1359
01:01:31,358 --> 01:01:33,417
No, no. I... uh, I do lots of things.

1360
01:01:33,493 --> 01:01:38,021
I comfort people that are desperately sad.

1361
01:01:38,098 --> 01:01:40,498
And I make personal appearances.

1362
01:01:40,567 --> 01:01:42,797
I...

1363
01:01:42,869 --> 01:01:45,429
Tears on a statue.

1364
01:01:45,505 --> 01:01:49,908
One time I put the face of the Lord
on a bowl of oatmeal.

1365
01:01:49,976 --> 01:01:51,170
Just to cheer people up.

1366
01:01:51,244 --> 01:01:53,974
You know, those kind of things.

1367
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:57,346
But mostly I... I take people up to see God.

1368
01:01:57,417 --> 01:01:58,941
That's why I'm here.

1369
01:01:59,019 --> 01:02:03,683
But I-I just keep thinking
about that story...

1370
01:02:03,757 --> 01:02:07,523
and why it was funny.

1371
01:02:07,594 --> 01:02:09,585
The story I told on the radio?

1372
01:02:09,663 --> 01:02:11,426
It was about penguins.

1373
01:02:11,498 --> 01:02:13,295
Oh. The penguin joke.

1374
01:02:15,435 --> 01:02:17,596
Two penguins standing on an ice floe.

1375
01:02:17,671 --> 01:02:18,763
That's the one.

1376
01:02:18,839 --> 01:02:20,966
And the first penguin says...

1377
01:02:21,041 --> 01:02:23,305
"You look like
you're wearing a tuxedo."

1378
01:02:24,678 --> 01:02:26,305
And the second penguin says...

1379
01:02:26,379 --> 01:02:28,006
"What makes you think I'm not?"

1380
01:02:31,585 --> 01:02:33,177
- Is there more?
- No.

1381
01:02:33,253 --> 01:02:34,550
- That's the joke?
- Mm-hmm.

1382
01:02:34,621 --> 01:02:35,849
Why is that funny?

1383
01:02:37,090 --> 01:02:39,422
I guess it's funny
because people laugh at it.

1384
01:02:39,493 --> 01:02:42,894
I'm not laughing.

1385
01:02:42,963 --> 01:02:48,230
You're an angel.

1386
01:02:48,301 --> 01:02:50,826
G.K. to the stage, please.
G.K. to the stage, please.

1387
01:02:50,904 --> 01:02:51,996
I should probably go.

1388
01:02:52,072 --> 01:02:54,870
Oh yes, of course.
I didn't come for you.

1389
01:02:54,941 --> 01:02:58,001
Oh. OK. All right.

1390
01:02:58,078 --> 01:02:59,170
I think they're waiting for me.

1391
01:02:59,246 --> 01:03:02,977
Oh... what did the second penguin say?

1392
01:03:03,049 --> 01:03:08,487
The second penguin said,
"What makes you think I'm not?" OK?

1393
01:03:08,555 --> 01:03:10,352
- OK.
- All right. See you.

1394
01:03:11,825 --> 01:03:13,452
Take your time.

1395
01:03:13,527 --> 01:03:15,654
Thanks.

1396
01:03:15,729 --> 01:03:19,995
Two minutes from broadcast.
Two minutes, please.

1397
01:03:20,066 --> 01:03:22,091
Ahem. Ahem. Ahem.

1398
01:03:22,168 --> 01:03:23,260
Could I have a word with you?

1399
01:03:24,571 --> 01:03:28,905
Uh, we have a situation here,
um, which we are monitoring...

1400
01:03:28,975 --> 01:03:31,409
but I wanted you to be apprised of it.

1401
01:03:32,979 --> 01:03:34,810
You mean the woman
in the white trench coat?

1402
01:03:34,881 --> 01:03:36,542
No, there's a woman in a w...

1403
01:03:36,616 --> 01:03:38,675
a white trench coat, yes.
You saw her?

1404
01:03:38,752 --> 01:03:40,686
- I saw her over here.
- You spoke to her?

1405
01:03:40,754 --> 01:03:42,312
You... no, you were talking to her.

1406
01:03:42,389 --> 01:03:43,481
You saw that?

1407
01:03:43,557 --> 01:03:45,024
Yeah. You.

1408
01:03:45,091 --> 01:03:48,151
Well, if you see her in the audience,
I need you to give me a high sign.

1409
01:03:48,228 --> 01:03:50,162
Just use... give me a signal
with your hand.

1410
01:03:50,230 --> 01:03:52,460
Do, uh...

1411
01:03:52,532 --> 01:03:53,624
No. Here, do it behind your back.

1412
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:56,066
- Just... just... just wiggle.
- Rabbit tail?

1413
01:03:56,136 --> 01:03:59,867
Yeah, and give me a verbal, uh, sign,
some... something in code.

1414
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:01,430
Just say, uh, indemnity.

1415
01:04:01,508 --> 01:04:02,770
- Indemnity. Yeah.
- OK.

1416
01:04:02,842 --> 01:04:04,867
Or no. Granite Falls.

1417
01:04:04,945 --> 01:04:06,845
OK. How does that...

1418
01:04:06,913 --> 01:04:08,278
How does that go?
Granite Falls?

1419
01:04:08,348 --> 01:04:10,339
Well, you just say, uh,
then we would like to do a song now...

1420
01:04:10,417 --> 01:04:12,885
for our dear friends in...

1421
01:04:12,953 --> 01:04:14,045
Granite Falls.

1422
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:15,348
OK. All right. OK.

1423
01:04:15,422 --> 01:04:19,358
And then if I miss that,
uh, this'll be a cue for Rich...

1424
01:04:19,426 --> 01:04:21,826
to do a-a musical turn.

1425
01:04:25,699 --> 01:04:27,496
- That's the code.
- Code?

1426
01:04:27,567 --> 01:04:29,467
Then I'll get it. OK?

1427
01:04:29,536 --> 01:04:31,697
That's how I got into radio, actually.

1428
01:04:31,771 --> 01:04:32,738
Morse code.

1429
01:04:32,806 --> 01:04:35,639
I was a deckhand on a... on a boat.

1430
01:04:35,709 --> 01:04:37,370
Big storm. November.

1431
01:04:37,444 --> 01:04:38,809
I'll never forget it.

1432
01:04:38,878 --> 01:04:40,038
You got on the ship radio...

1433
01:04:40,113 --> 01:04:42,581
and you told jokes
and you sang for two hours...

1434
01:04:42,649 --> 01:04:43,673
until the ship came in safely to port.

1435
01:04:43,750 --> 01:04:46,014
Right.
I told you that story?

1436
01:04:46,086 --> 01:04:47,053
Granite Falls.

1437
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:48,246
- G. K?
- Granite Falls. Right.

1438
01:04:48,321 --> 01:04:49,379
Yeah?

1439
01:04:49,456 --> 01:04:52,186
- If you see G.K. do that behind his back...
- Fifteen seconds.

1440
01:04:52,258 --> 01:04:53,225
it's your cue to go like this.

1441
01:04:55,428 --> 01:04:57,396
So what are you gonna do
for work after this?

1442
01:04:57,464 --> 01:04:58,988
I don't know.
I'll find a job somewhere.

1443
01:05:00,133 --> 01:05:01,498
Like where?

1444
01:05:01,568 --> 01:05:04,901
A job where I never have to say a word.

1445
01:05:04,971 --> 01:05:06,165
Why?

1446
01:05:06,239 --> 01:05:08,400
That's why. Right there.

1447
01:05:08,475 --> 01:05:09,442
What are you gonna do?

1448
01:05:09,509 --> 01:05:11,067
Like be an underwear model
or something?

1449
01:05:11,144 --> 01:05:12,304
If they ask, sure.

1450
01:05:12,379 --> 01:05:14,313
- You're on.
- Yes.

1451
01:05:17,717 --> 01:05:20,242
And we're back with more of
A Prairie Home Companion...

1452
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:24,586
brought to you by the Federation
of Associated Organizations.

1453
01:05:24,658 --> 01:05:28,185
Somewhere there's an organization
just for you.

1454
01:05:28,261 --> 01:05:29,421
And brought to you by Fred Farrell...

1455
01:05:29,496 --> 01:05:30,758
the name you've gradually come
to trust...

1456
01:05:30,830 --> 01:05:33,424
when it comes
to animal nuisance control.

1457
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:34,762
The Johnson Girls coming up...

1458
01:05:34,834 --> 01:05:38,099
and the old trail hands,
Dusty and Lefty are with us...

1459
01:05:38,171 --> 01:05:39,604
and our good friend Jearlyn Steele.

1460
01:05:39,673 --> 01:05:41,106

Vice-president, Security
and, uh, Data Acquisition.

1528
01:09:30,103 --> 01:09:32,037
Good for you.
Show almost over?

1529
01:09:32,105 --> 01:09:33,333
Almost. Yes.

1530
01:09:33,406 --> 01:09:34,737
Just in time then.

1531
01:09:34,807 --> 01:09:36,001
The show's been going on how long?

1532
01:09:36,075 --> 01:09:37,599
Somebody said fifty years.

1533
01:09:37,677 --> 01:09:40,737
N-nearly. Uh, thirty... something.

1534
01:09:40,813 --> 01:09:42,678
Weird. It's like a time warp.

1535
01:09:42,749 --> 01:09:44,080
I feel like an anthropologist...

1536
01:09:44,150 --> 01:09:47,711
finding some primitive tribe
squatting around a fire in the forest...

1537
01:09:47,787 --> 01:09:50,119
telling stories,
sparks flying up in the air.

1538
01:09:50,189 --> 01:09:51,417
Yeah. Heh heh.

1539
01:09:51,491 --> 01:09:54,551
Well, we've got the, uh, luxury box
for you, right here.

1540
01:09:56,129 --> 01:09:57,255
Right this way.

1541
01:10:00,433 --> 01:10:02,594
Who's that guy?

1542
01:10:02,669 --> 01:10:05,968
Oh, that's the guy, uh,
used to come see the shows here.

1543
01:10:06,039 --> 01:10:08,371
Um, local boy.
He's a writer.

1544
01:10:08,441 --> 01:10:10,409
Uh, he wrote novels.

1545
01:10:10,476 --> 01:10:11,636
Uh, F. Scott Fitzgerald.

1546
01:10:11,711 --> 01:10:13,008
Grew up right here in St. Paul.

1547
01:10:13,079 --> 01:10:14,103
What kind of novels?

1548
01:10:15,148 --> 01:10:16,672
Uh, romantic ones.

1549
01:10:16,749 --> 01:10:17,716
- Oh.
- Mostly.

1550
01:10:17,784 --> 01:10:19,342
I don't read romances. No time.

1551
01:10:19,419 --> 01:10:22,115
Hmm. We usually have,
uh, clients in here.

1552
01:10:22,188 --> 01:10:24,053
You know, five or six of them
at a time, sponsors...

1553
01:10:24,123 --> 01:10:26,387
That's some nice plaster work
around the proscenium there.

1554
01:10:26,459 --> 01:10:27,892
We'll have to remember
to save a piece of that.

1555
01:10:27,961 --> 01:10:29,622
I wish we were taping this show.

1556
01:10:29,696 --> 01:10:31,596
This is a live show.

1557
01:10:31,664 --> 01:10:33,598
Videotape.
Historical purposes.

1558
01:10:33,666 --> 01:10:35,224
Send it to a museum.

1559
01:10:35,301 --> 01:10:36,734
Well, this is just great.
This is all I need.

1560
01:10:36,803 --> 01:10:38,896
This is the first time
somebody died at the show.

1561
01:10:38,972 --> 01:10:41,065
- I mean, the first time!
- Al, we're all gettin' older.

1562
01:10:41,140 --> 01:10:42,107
He's dead?!

1563
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:43,506
The show's not over, is it?

1564
01:10:43,576 --> 01:10:45,635
We've got a dead man downstairs.

1565
01:10:45,712 --> 01:10:46,804
We've gotta do something.

1566
01:10:46,879 --> 01:10:48,574
Just be glad... glad you
don't have him onstage.

1567
01:10:48,648 --> 01:10:50,582
- When did this happen?
- Who's that, Chuck?

1568
01:10:50,650 --> 01:10:51,981
- Yes.
- Where's Evelyn?

1569
01:10:52,051 --> 01:10:53,075
Evelyn was down there.

1570
01:10:53,152 --> 01:10:55,518
He was waitin' for Evelyn
when he passed away.

1571
01:10:55,588 --> 01:10:57,886
He died with a heart full of hope.

1572
01:10:57,957 --> 01:11:00,551
Yeah, that's not a bad way to go
when you think about it.

1573
01:11:00,626 --> 01:11:03,220
Sittin' there in the dark,
in your underwear, you know?

1574
01:11:03,296 --> 01:11:04,695
Waitin' for your lover to come.

1575
01:11:04,764 --> 01:11:06,322
He was in his underwear?

1576
01:11:06,399 --> 01:11:09,766
Donna told me he was wearin'
boxer shorts with big raspberries on 'em...

1577
01:11:09,836 --> 01:11:13,101
and a great big bottle of massage oil
and a bayberry candle goin'...

1578
01:11:13,172 --> 01:11:15,231
and Mills Brothers' Greatest Hits.

1579
01:11:15,308 --> 01:11:17,970
He was all set.
He was loaded for Evelyn.

1580
01:11:18,044 --> 01:11:20,274
Well, uh, can I offer you
somethin' to drink?

1581
01:11:20,346 --> 01:11:21,813
Water. No ice. No lemon.

1582
01:11:24,083 --> 01:11:25,778
Water. No ice. No lemon.

1583
01:11:25,852 --> 01:11:27,285
Straight up. Neat.

1584
01:11:28,855 --> 01:11:32,382
Radio sound effects
learned from a master.

1585
01:11:32,458 --> 01:11:33,857
What can I tell you about the show?

1586
01:11:33,926 --> 01:11:35,791
I know everything I need
to know about the show.

1587
01:11:36,929 --> 01:11:38,863
- You're sure about that?
- Yes.

1588
01:11:38,931 --> 01:11:40,262
You're not gonna change your mind?

1589
01:11:40,333 --> 01:11:41,698
Ahh! No.

1590
01:11:41,768 --> 01:11:42,894
Hmm.

1591
01:11:42,969 --> 01:11:44,800
Lot of good people up there.

1592
01:11:44,871 --> 01:11:45,929
On the stage.

1593
01:11:46,005 --> 01:11:46,972
Lot of 'em.

1594
01:11:48,307 --> 01:11:50,605
I mean, I'm a man
of the world like yourself...

1595
01:11:50,676 --> 01:11:52,200
but, uh, these folks
put their lives into this.

1596
01:11:52,278 --> 01:11:54,371
Now they can put their lives
into something else.

1597
01:11:54,447 --> 01:11:56,176
There's always something
to put your life into, isn't there?

1598
01:11:56,249 --> 01:11:57,648
It's like the Scripture tells us...

1599
01:11:57,717 --> 01:11:59,651
you have to lose your life
before you can...

1600
01:11:59,719 --> 01:12:00,845
find it.

1601
01:12:01,888 --> 01:12:04,152
Scripture is guiding you here?

1602
01:12:04,223 --> 01:12:06,555
The company is owned
by people of faith, Mr. Noir.

1603
01:12:08,061 --> 01:12:12,122
Ahh. Before I came to the Lord,
I played in a band myself.

1604
01:12:12,198 --> 01:12:14,166
The Dukes of Rhythm.
Ha ha.

1605
01:12:14,233 --> 01:12:16,098
We were terrible.

1606
01:12:16,169 --> 01:12:19,434
Then, thank God, we were saved by
the simple realization of the truth.

1607
01:12:19,572 --> 01:12:21,164
We were no good.
We got fired.

1608
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:23,037
It was a blessing.

1609
01:12:23,109 --> 01:12:24,076
You wanna say something?

1610
01:12:24,143 --> 01:12:25,610
Say what?
No, I don't want to say...

1611
01:12:25,678 --> 01:12:26,645
You know, you should say somethin'...

1612
01:12:26,712 --> 01:12:28,737
'cause he was on the show
all these years.

1613
01:12:28,815 --> 01:12:29,782
Absolutely.

1614
01:12:29,849 --> 01:12:31,783
I don't do eulogies. I don't.

1615
01:12:31,851 --> 01:12:34,012
Is there a reason for that?
Or you just don't care for people?

1616
01:12:34,087 --> 01:12:35,679
I'm at an age where
if I started to do them...

1617
01:12:35,755 --> 01:12:37,484
I'd do nothing but eulogies.

1618
01:12:37,557 --> 01:12:39,184
How about just
a moment of silence?

1619
01:12:39,258 --> 01:12:41,749
Silence on the radio?
I don't know how that works.

1620
01:12:41,828 --> 01:12:43,193
Garrison, OK, thank you.

1621
01:12:43,262 --> 01:12:44,559
OK, we've got about thirty seconds.
Thirty seconds.

1622
01:12:44,630 --> 01:12:46,359
Hold on a second.
You're saying if my mom died...

1623
01:12:46,432 --> 01:12:48,366
you wouldn't do anything,
you wouldn't say anything.

1624
01:12:48,434 --> 01:12:49,401
If I what?

1625
01:12:49,469 --> 01:12:52,063
You'd just ignore it,
you'd act like it never happened?

1626
01:12:52,138 --> 01:12:53,105
How could you do that?

1627
01:12:53,172 --> 01:12:54,400
We don't look back in radio.

1628
01:12:54,474 --> 01:12:55,668
That's the beauty of it.

1629
01:12:55,741 --> 01:12:57,436
Nobody gets old.
Nobody dies.

1630
01:12:57,510 --> 01:12:59,137
We just keep on goin'.

1631
01:12:59,212 --> 01:13:00,179
What if you died?

1632
01:13:00,246 --> 01:13:01,611
I will.

1633
01:13:01,681 --> 01:13:03,046
You don't want people
to remember you?

1634
01:13:03,116 --> 01:13:05,914
I don't want them to be told
to remember me.

1635
01:13:05,985 --> 01:13:08,044
Hmm?

1636
01:13:08,121 --> 01:13:10,146
You know what?
Somebody died down there.

1637
01:13:10,223 --> 01:13:11,212
That's right.

1638
01:13:11,290 --> 01:13:12,587
OK? And we're not
even paying attention...

1639
01:13:12,658 --> 01:13:14,057
and you're not even
gonna say anything?

1640
01:13:14,127 --> 01:13:15,594
We pay attention by doin' our job.

1641
01:13:15,661 --> 01:13:18,186
Go, go, go.
You're on, you're on, you're on.

1642
01:13:18,264 --> 01:13:20,129
I gotta get someone
to take me home.

1643
01:13:20,199 --> 01:13:22,030
I'm not spendin' the night
alone tonight.

1644
01:13:22,101 --> 01:13:24,194
Don't... nobody even cares.

1645
01:13:24,270 --> 01:13:26,067
No, we do.
We all care.

1646
01:13:26,139 --> 01:13:27,538
We care like hell.

1647
01:13:27,607 --> 01:13:28,574
You're gonna want to have...

1648
01:13:28,641 --> 01:13:31,075
a whole freezer full
of Prince of Pizzas.

1649
01:13:31,144 --> 01:13:34,739
It's the frozen pizza that
tastes homemade always.

1650
01:13:34,814 --> 01:13:38,807
Made from real Minnesota
cheese and sausage.

1651

That's fun... that's funny.

1656

Watching them through this glass,
it's like a zoo.

1657
01:13:57,303 --> 01:14:00,602

Yes, Guy Noir here.

1665
01:14:20,193 --> 01:14:21,285
Get me Molly.

1666
01:14:24,263 --> 01:14:25,252
Yeah?

1667
01:14:25,331 --> 01:14:28,300
Molly, listen, I need you to do something
for me. It's very important.

1668
01:14:28,367 --> 01:14:29,334
What?

1669
01:14:29,402 --> 01:14:31,700
I need you come out here
so I can talk to you face to face.

1670
01:14:31,771 --> 01:14:33,705
- Can you do that?
- I'm right here.

1671
01:14:33,773 --> 01:14:36,537
Wha... b... d...

1672
01:14:36,609 --> 01:14:39,043
- Who's this?
- I don't know.

1673
01:14:39,111 --> 01:14:41,409
No, who...
who's talking to me?

1674
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:42,469
I don't... I-I am!

1675
01:14:42,548 --> 01:14:44,038
Shh! Hello?

1676
01:14:44,116 --> 01:14:45,674
Hello?

1677
01:14:45,751 --> 01:14:47,116
Hello?

1678
01:14:48,554 --> 01:14:50,181
There's nobody there.

1679
01:14:50,256 --> 01:14:51,985
OK.

1680
01:14:52,058 --> 01:14:54,492
I have to ask you
to do something for me.

1681
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:55,527
It's very important.

1682
01:14:55,595 --> 01:14:57,085
- It's, uh...
- What?

1683
01:14:58,231 --> 01:15:00,222
I need a drink.

1684
01:15:00,299 --> 01:15:01,766
Uhh!

1685
01:15:01,834 --> 01:15:02,892
Oh, je...

1686
01:15:04,870 --> 01:15:06,030
You OK?

1687
01:15:08,608 --> 01:15:09,575
Yeah.

1688
01:15:09,642 --> 01:15:13,544
So how's it goin' in there
with, uh, axeman?

1689
01:15:14,580 --> 01:15:15,740
Very slippery.

1690
01:15:15,815 --> 01:15:17,146
How do they keep
the drinks on there?

1691
01:15:17,216 --> 01:15:18,240
It's going very well.

1692
01:15:18,317 --> 01:15:20,342
I mean, well, he's tough.
He's tough.

1693
01:15:20,419 --> 01:15:25,379
But, uh, I think, uh,
I think I have another solution.

1694
01:15:25,458 --> 01:15:26,425
What?

1695
01:15:26,492 --> 01:15:28,119
Well, he used to be in a band.

1696
01:15:28,194 --> 01:15:30,185
A long time ago
called the Dukes of Rhythm...

1697
01:15:30,263 --> 01:15:32,663
and I think if we can round up
the guys who were in that band...

1698
01:15:32,732 --> 01:15:34,723
and get 'em all on the show...

1699
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:36,358
Sorry.

1700
01:15:36,435 --> 01:15:41,202
Um, we can, um, we can maybe
get him to change his mind.

1701
01:15:41,274 --> 01:15:46,473
Have a kind of reunion, you know,
with all the, uh, band members...

1702
01:15:46,545 --> 01:15:47,569
right here on
The Prairie Home Companion.

1703
01:15:48,648 --> 01:15:49,615
Here's to happy endings.

1704
01:15:49,682 --> 01:15:51,172
Happy endings!

1705
01:15:54,220 --> 01:15:56,211
Ahh!

1706
01:15:56,289 --> 01:15:57,256
Ahh!

1707
01:15:57,323 --> 01:15:58,449
Oh, God, that's good.

1708
01:15:58,524 --> 01:15:59,718
Mother's milk.

1709
01:15:59,792 --> 01:16:02,158
- What?
- Sorry.

1710
01:16:02,228 --> 01:16:04,219
Here's what I need you to do.

1711
01:16:04,297 --> 01:16:06,231
- Hmm.
- Take this note...

1712
01:16:06,299 --> 01:16:08,460
uhh, to the woman...

1713
01:16:08,534 --> 01:16:09,933
backstage...

1714
01:16:10,002 --> 01:16:11,264
Give it to who?

1715
01:16:11,337 --> 01:16:12,361
The lady backstage.

1716
01:16:12,438 --> 01:16:13,905
The blonde lady
with a white trench coat.

1717
01:16:13,973 --> 01:16:15,065
Blonde lady with
a white trench coat?

1718
01:16:15,141 --> 01:16:17,041
Yes. She's beautiful, blonde.

1719
01:16:17,109 --> 01:16:19,134
Ahh, ahh...

1720
01:16:19,211 --> 01:16:20,269
You can't miss her.

1721
01:16:20,346 --> 01:16:22,405
"Angel, man in the..."

1722
01:16:22,481 --> 01:16:24,574
Shh!

1723
01:16:24,650 --> 01:16:26,015
Boat?

1724
01:16:26,085 --> 01:16:27,211
Booth.

1725
01:16:27,286 --> 01:16:29,186
"Man in the booth...

1726
01:16:29,255 --> 01:16:33,282
Make him go away."

1727
01:16:34,493 --> 01:16:38,020
Give this to her,
and then destroy that.

who've been singing together...

1730
01:16:45,671 --> 01:16:49,607
since they were little girls
growing up in Oshkosh, Wisconsin.

1731
01:16:49,675 --> 01:16:51,939
They've kept alive all those old songs
that go way back.

Rhonda and Yolanda.

Sven said to his friend,
"Boy, I think my wife died."

1902
01:24:18,423 --> 01:24:20,357
His friend said,
"Well, what do you mean, you think?"

1903
01:24:20,425 --> 01:24:25,362
"Well, the sex is still the same,
but the dishes are stackin' up."

1904
01:24:25,430 --> 01:24:27,398
Ha ha ha!

1905
01:24:29,468 --> 01:24:30,492
Hey, Dusty.

01:24:35,741 --> 01:24:37,709
No, I didn't.

1909

Yeah? Go ahead.

1913
01:24:47,486 --> 01:24:49,613
Why do they call it PMS?

1914
01:24:49,688 --> 01:24:51,883
PMS? Why, I don't know. Why?

1915
01:24:51,957 --> 01:24:54,721
'Cause Mad Cow was already taken.

1916
01:24:55,994 --> 01:24:57,427
All right, that's enough.

1917
01:24:57,496 --> 01:25:00,329

holy water with castor oil?

01:25:07,406 --> 01:25:09,397
I don't know, Lefty.
What do you get?

1922
01:25:09,474 --> 01:25:11,374
A religious movement.

1923
01:25:12,778 --> 01:25:14,268
Ha ha ha ha!

1924
01:25:14,346 --> 01:25:19,374
Hey, uh... hey, Lefty, what did
the elephant say to the naked man?

01:34:35,373 --> 01:34:37,068
So? I always wanted to do
a farewell tour.

2077
01:34:37,142 --> 01:34:38,507
I loved doin' that last show.

2078
01:34:38,576 --> 01:34:41,807
I just want to do one last show
and then another one...

2079
01:34:41,880 --> 01:34:43,677
until I'm in a wheelchair.

2080
01:34:43,748 --> 01:34:45,682
I just want to keep doin' them.

2081
01:34:45,750 --> 01:34:47,615
You know, as long as I can
remember the words.

2082
01:34:47,685 --> 01:34:49,516
There's all sorts of towns
we haven't played.

2083
01:34:49,587 --> 01:34:52,852
I mean, you've got Gooseberry Falls
and Lake Winnebigoshish.

2084
01:34:52,924 --> 01:34:55,893
Up in Lake Winnebigoshish
a lot of people are waitin' to see us.

2085
01:34:55,960 --> 01:34:57,052
Well, you... don't count on me.

2086
01:34:57,128 --> 01:34:58,288
I got a lot of stuff happening.

2087
01:34:58,363 --> 01:34:59,523
What?

2088
01:34:59,597 --> 01:35:01,792
Oh, things.
Things that are in the works.

2089
01:35:01,866 --> 01:35:04,664
Different deals I'm... working out.

2090
01:35:04,736 --> 01:35:06,601
I'll be in and out of town a lot.

2091
01:35:06,671 --> 01:35:09,572
- Yeah, OK. So, what about you?
- Hey, I'm free.

2092
01:35:09,641 --> 01:35:10,608
- Oh!
- Great!

2093
01:35:10,675 --> 01:35:12,609
- Workin' at the parking ramp.
- The parkin' ramp?

2094
01:35:12,677 --> 01:35:14,611
Yes. It's a good job.
I like it.

2095
01:35:14,679 --> 01:35:15,668
I read a lot of books.

2096
01:35:15,747 --> 01:35:16,714
Make that four eggs.

2097
01:35:16,781 --> 01:35:18,248
Oh, boy.
You're readin' a lot.

2098
01:35:18,316 --> 01:35:20,841
- Yeah.
- That's interesting.

2099
01:35:20,985 --> 01:35:22,816
Oh, look at this!
Look who's here!

2100
01:35:22,887 --> 01:35:24,286
Oh, my God, I miss these guys.

2101
01:35:24,355 --> 01:35:26,220
Ha ha ha!

2102
01:35:26,291 --> 01:35:29,351
Look who just blew in
from the old prairie.

2103
01:35:29,427 --> 01:35:33,022
I thought you left town
ahead of the sheriff?

2104
01:35:33,097 --> 01:35:35,827
Well, the woman decided
not to press charges.

2105
01:35:35,900 --> 01:35:38,164
Oh, yeah?
What was the crime? Snorin'?

2106
01:35:38,236 --> 01:35:40,568
Ha ha ha!

2107
01:35:40,638 --> 01:35:42,299
Love.

2108
01:35:42,373 --> 01:35:43,863
We just got back in town...

2109
01:35:43,942 --> 01:35:45,671
from playin' the casinos
in South Dakota.

2110
01:35:45,743 --> 01:35:47,233
Yeah? Playin' what? Pinochle?

2111
01:35:47,312 --> 01:35:48,336
Ha ha ha!

2112
01:35:48,413 --> 01:35:49,812
Playin' our music.

2113
01:35:49,881 --> 01:35:52,008
Hey, we hear you might be
gettin' a tour up.

2114
01:35:52,083 --> 01:35:53,107
Oh, yeah.

2115
01:35:53,184 --> 01:35:55,345
We've added some rope tricks
to the repertoire.

2116
01:35:55,420 --> 01:35:57,411
Flaming lariats.

2117
01:35:57,489 --> 01:35:59,081
It's called "Rings of Fire."

2118
01:35:59,157 --> 01:36:01,250
Well, you know,
we got a bus with bunk beds...

2119
01:36:01,326 --> 01:36:04,056
and we're goin' back
to playin' churches and schools.

2120
01:36:04,128 --> 01:36:05,095
Look at this.

2121
01:36:05,163 --> 01:36:08,564
She's only been workin' six months
and she's now the manager.

2122
01:36:09,367 --> 01:36:10,334
What does she do?

2123
01:36:10,401 --> 01:36:12,028
Um, I have no idea.

2124
01:36:12,103 --> 01:36:14,469
- Somethin' religious?
- Software.

2125
01:36:14,539 --> 01:36:17,064
Oh, it's big.
It's movin' like monkeys.

2126
01:36:17,141 --> 01:36:18,699
Hi.

2127
01:36:18,776 --> 01:36:21,244
All right, so, I looked
at your pension stuff.

2128
01:36:21,312 --> 01:36:22,540
Oh, good.

2129
01:36:22,614 --> 01:36:24,980
It's a horror show.

2130
01:36:25,049 --> 01:36:27,813
Have you ever heard of mutual funds?

2131
01:36:27,886 --> 01:36:30,116
You know, Mom, honestly,
you would have done a lot better...

2132
01:36:30,188 --> 01:36:33,817
if you'd just stuck it in a shoe box
and put it under your bed.

2133
01:36:33,892 --> 01:36:36,861
Well, that's why I
wanted you to help me.

2134
01:36:36,928 --> 01:36:38,919
So... here.
Sign there.

2135
01:36:38,997 --> 01:36:39,986
What is this?

2136
01:36:40,064 --> 01:36:41,827
I have to get your assets
working again.

2137
01:36:41,900 --> 01:36:43,925
- My what?
- Your assets.

2138
01:36:44,002 --> 01:36:47,733
Oh. Oh! Power of attorney.

2139
01:36:47,805 --> 01:36:50,000
Oh! And you spent $6,000 on a bus?

2140
01:36:50,074 --> 01:36:51,041
Yeah.

2141
01:36:51,109 --> 01:36:52,440
Why didn't you ask me first?

2142
01:36:52,510 --> 01:36:54,501
Well, I'm sorry.

2143
01:36:54,579 --> 01:36:57,047
So...

2144
01:36:57,115 --> 01:36:59,049
Can I keep the bus or?

2145
01:37:02,086 --> 01:37:04,077
We'll talk about it later.

2146
01:37:04,155 --> 01:37:06,089
- Hey...
- That sounds like a no.

2147
01:37:06,157 --> 01:37:07,215
I love you, too.

2148
01:37:07,292 --> 01:37:08,725
Bye, guys.

2149
01:37:08,793 --> 01:37:10,624
Donna?

2150
01:37:10,695 --> 01:37:11,889
- Bye!
- Oh, hey. Bye.

2151
01:37:11,963 --> 01:37:13,089
So long.

2152
01:37:13,164 --> 01:37:14,188
I thought that was
a terrific eulogy you gave...

2153
01:37:14,265 --> 01:37:16,130
for old man Soderberg
at his memorial service.

2154
01:37:16,200 --> 01:37:17,167
Thank you.

2155
01:37:17,235 --> 01:37:19,294
Too bad the old coot
couldn't have been there to hear it.

2156
01:37:19,370 --> 01:37:22,806
Yeah, and to have missed it
by just a few days.

2157
01:37:22,874 --> 01:37:24,808
Hmm. Ha ha!

2158
01:37:24,876 --> 01:37:26,173
Ha ha!

2159
01:37:29,847 --> 01:37:31,144
Ha ha ha!

2160
01:37:39,324 --> 01:37:40,814
I still love your laugh.

2161
01:37:40,892 --> 01:37:41,916
Oh, yeah.

2162
01:37:41,993 --> 01:37:44,621
- Hee hee hee!
- I got it.

2163
01:37:44,696 --> 01:37:47,096
I get bored.

2164
01:37:47,165 --> 01:37:48,257
Uh-huh.

2165
01:37:48,333 --> 01:37:50,494
Ha ha ha!

2166
01:37:50,568 --> 01:37:52,365
Thank you.

2167
01:37:52,437 --> 01:37:54,371
That joke just gets better and better.

2168
01:37:54,439 --> 01:37:56,566
- You know?
- Yep.

2169
01:38:00,278 --> 01:38:01,836
Anybody want to change their order?

2170
01:38:04,349 --> 01:38:06,078
Can I get a coffee?

2171
01:38:06,150 --> 01:38:09,950
Ha ha ha!

2172
01:38:10,021 --> 01:38:11,283
- Ha ha!
- Ha ha!

2173
01:38:11,356 --> 01:38:13,119
- Ha ha!
- Ha ha!
