1
00:01:13,773 --> 00:01:17,812
I always worry that maybe people aren't
gonna like me when I go to a party.

2
00:01:17,973 --> 00:01:20,168
Isn't that crazy?

3
00:01:21,013 --> 00:01:26,451
Do you ever get kind of a sick feeling in
your stomach when you dread things?

4
00:01:26,613 --> 00:01:29,810
I wouldn't wanna miss a party,
but every time I go to one...

5
00:01:29,973 --> 00:01:33,648
...I keep feeling like
the whole world's against me.

6
00:01:33,813 --> 00:01:37,010
See, I've spent my whole life
in military academies.

7
00:01:37,173 --> 00:01:40,006
My mother doesn't have a place for me
where she lives...

8
00:01:40,173 --> 00:01:42,607
...and she doesn't know
what else to do with me.

9
00:01:42,773 --> 00:01:47,324
You mustn't misunderstand about
my mother. She's really a lovely person.

10
00:01:47,493 --> 00:01:51,884
I guess every boy thinks his mother
is beautiful, but my mother really is.

11
00:01:52,053 --> 00:01:56,490
She tells me in every letter how sorry
she is that we're not together more...

12
00:01:56,653 --> 00:01:59,725
...but she has to think of her work.

13
00:01:59,893 --> 00:02:03,681
One time we were together, though.
She met me in San Francisco once...

14
00:02:03,853 --> 00:02:08,529
...and we were together for two whole
days, just like we were sweethearts.

15
00:02:08,693 --> 00:02:12,368
It was the most wonderful time
I ever had.

16
00:02:12,533 --> 00:02:16,845
Then I had to go back
to the military academy.

17
00:02:17,013 --> 00:02:21,165
Every time I walk into that barracks,
I get a kind of....

18
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:29,163
A kind of a....

19
00:02:33,613 --> 00:02:35,410
I'm sorry.

20
00:02:42,253 --> 00:02:45,006
Kind of a depressed feeling.

21
00:02:45,173 --> 00:02:48,927
It's got hard, stone walls.
You know what I mean?

22
00:02:49,493 --> 00:02:53,008
I guess I've bored you enough,
telling you about myself.

23
00:02:54,453 --> 00:02:56,045
Thank you.

24
00:02:56,213 --> 00:03:00,365
Sorry about that. I goofed up the last
couple of lines. I guess I'm nervous.

25
00:03:00,653 --> 00:03:02,450
That's okay. You did very well.

26
00:03:14,573 --> 00:03:16,325
I'm sorry.

27
00:03:40,373 --> 00:03:43,012
Thank you. You play very well.

28
00:03:43,173 --> 00:03:48,167
Now Mrs. Tossoff's gonna play notes
for you. Sing them back to us. Like so:

29
00:03:52,093 --> 00:03:56,371
-It's too low for me.
-You're a tenor? You want to start here?

30
00:03:58,933 --> 00:04:01,163
Louder, please.

31
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:39,484
I'm so nervous.

32
00:04:39,653 --> 00:04:41,928
-I'm not singing.
-But you have to.

33
00:04:42,093 --> 00:04:44,288
-But I came to dance.
-You have to sing too.

34
00:04:44,453 --> 00:04:46,762
-And act, and play an instrument.
-All three?

35
00:04:46,933 --> 00:04:49,891
-It says "performing arts," doesn't it?
-You don't have to do everything.

36
00:04:50,093 --> 00:04:55,725
-Sure as shit helps, baby.
-Thank you. Next group, please. Hurry.

37
00:04:55,893 --> 00:04:58,851
-Oh, I like your nose ring.
-I'm into culture.

38
00:04:59,053 --> 00:05:03,012
-Does that hurt, or is that ethnic?
-Music, please, Mrs. Snell.

39
00:05:03,173 --> 00:05:06,802
Please pay attention.
We have a lot to do today.

40
00:05:09,693 --> 00:05:12,526
-I hate my legs.
-Yeah. Me too.

41
00:05:12,733 --> 00:05:16,521
-I've tried every diet in the whole world.
-Really? Me too.

42
00:05:16,893 --> 00:05:21,330
But you can't help your glands.
I'm sorry! I'm just so nervous.

43
00:05:21,493 --> 00:05:24,451
Relax! Come on, use your body.

44
00:05:33,693 --> 00:05:37,288
-Careful. That's 7000 worth of machine.
-Dollars or pounds?

45
00:05:37,453 --> 00:05:40,843
Don't touch the rotary pods.
I got it set on saw-tooth.

46
00:05:41,013 --> 00:05:45,450
Why can't he play piccolo? Something
sensible. Or the accordion, like Papa did.

47
00:05:45,613 --> 00:05:49,162
Same reason you drive a checker and
not a Roman chariot. It's progress.

48
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:53,246
My son's head is into the future.
And Papa could never play the accordion.

49
00:05:58,293 --> 00:06:01,763
-Do you think you're talented?
-You swine! You coward! You cad!

50
00:06:01,973 --> 00:06:04,362
You dare judge me in my misfortitude?

51
00:06:04,533 --> 00:06:08,162
You dare to ask me the question
who is the father of my child?

52
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:12,804
-You! You! I point to you, Nigel!
-Next, please.

53
00:06:13,053 --> 00:06:18,286
The next group of musicians can
go to the fifth floor now, please.

54
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:32,725
-Name?
-Excuse me, miss.

55
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:36,522
You don't need his name. He's not here
for the audition. He's my partner.

56
00:06:36,693 --> 00:06:38,763
-What school's he from?
-He ain't into school.

57
00:06:38,933 --> 00:06:43,802
He's just helping me out with my
dancing. But it's me who's auditioning.

58
00:06:43,973 --> 00:06:47,807
Mulholland, Shirley. I'm all fixed up.
I filled in all your papers and all.

59
00:06:47,973 --> 00:06:50,123
He doesn't go upstairs
without filling in his name.

60
00:06:50,293 --> 00:06:55,242
Leroy's his name, but I'm auditioning.
Shirley Mulholland. That's two L's.

61
00:06:55,413 --> 00:06:59,804
-And don't ask him to do no writing.
-Doesn't he talk, even?

62
00:07:00,013 --> 00:07:02,573
He ain't into conversation
until you get to know him.

63
00:07:03,093 --> 00:07:06,972
-Leroy what?
-Leroy Johnson. Can we go up now?

64
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:10,166
He's not going up
until he checks his knife.

65
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:13,450
We ain't staying long enough for
no trouble. He's just helping a friend.

66
00:07:13,653 --> 00:07:16,850
He's not helping out anyone
unless he checks his knife.

67
00:07:17,013 --> 00:07:20,528
This is the High School for Performing
Arts. We don't cut each other up here.

68
00:07:21,533 --> 00:07:23,251
-You want it?
-I want it.

69
00:07:23,573 --> 00:07:25,882
-You sure you want it?
-Yeah, I'm sure.

70
00:07:27,093 --> 00:07:30,051
-Promise you won't steal it, now?
-I promise.

71
00:07:32,413 --> 00:07:34,722
-Thanks, ma'am.
-Name?

72
00:07:34,933 --> 00:07:38,209
Don't worry, baby. I got lots of knives.

73
00:07:39,053 --> 00:07:41,965
-What are you going to do for us?
-I was gonna sing.

74
00:07:42,173 --> 00:07:45,404
-You don't have to sing, honey.
-We know our rights.

75
00:07:45,573 --> 00:07:49,612
-You can't refuse her an audition.
-She's not supposed to sing her audition.

76
00:07:49,773 --> 00:07:54,608
Please, excuse me, if you don't mind.
Honey, you don't have to sing for us...

77
00:07:54,773 --> 00:07:58,402
-...because this is the drama department.
-When she sings, it is drama.

78
00:07:58,693 --> 00:08:01,161
-What's your name, honey?
-Finsecker.

79
00:08:03,573 --> 00:08:04,847
Doris Finsecker.

80
00:08:10,613 --> 00:08:13,525
-Hi.
-How do you do?

81
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:15,729
-What's your name?
-Ralph Garci.

82
00:08:16,053 --> 00:08:20,046
-Who was your teacher?
-Well, my father taught me.

83
00:08:20,213 --> 00:08:24,809
He's doing work for the government.
I'm not supposed to talk about it...

84
00:08:25,013 --> 00:08:31,009
...but my father played some of the
most beautiful symphonies...

85
00:08:31,173 --> 00:08:33,767
-...in the whole world once.
-What did he play?

86
00:08:34,933 --> 00:08:36,810
Trombones.

87
00:08:37,773 --> 00:08:40,048
And French horns.

88
00:08:41,533 --> 00:08:42,522
English horns.

89
00:08:44,533 --> 00:08:46,524
-Saxophones.
-Anything else?

90
00:08:46,733 --> 00:08:48,007
Yeah.

91
00:08:49,373 --> 00:08:54,208
-Bongos, maracas, that sort of stuff.
-What did he teach you?

92
00:09:02,133 --> 00:09:04,044
Why don't you
try the dance department.

93
00:09:04,213 --> 00:09:07,569
-Why do you want to go to school here?
-Should I tell him?

94
00:09:07,973 --> 00:09:09,122
Yeah, tell him.

95
00:09:09,893 --> 00:09:12,805
We can't afford a professional
children's school.

96
00:09:14,693 --> 00:09:18,686
Okay. If you want to sing, go ahead.
Then we'll look at your acting.

97
00:09:19,853 --> 00:09:21,491
I'm a little nervous.

98
00:09:21,693 --> 00:09:26,289
Don't be shy, Sheila. Come over here.
What are you going to do?

99
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:29,411
-I'm doing <i>The Towering Inferno.</i>
-What?

100
00:09:30,613 --> 00:09:33,650
-You know, the movie?
-Oh.

101
00:09:34,093 --> 00:09:37,130
All right, I'm playing O.J. Simpson.
I'm in this building.

102
00:09:37,293 --> 00:09:40,763
There's fire all around, right?
So I go to the elevator.

103
00:09:40,973 --> 00:09:44,807
Think of it as a concentration exercise.
Just sing to Michael...

104
00:09:45,013 --> 00:09:50,246
-...and don't worry about anybody else.
-I don't think I can. I can't just stare.

105
00:09:50,453 --> 00:09:52,011
He won't mind.

106
00:09:55,293 --> 00:09:59,411
-Waiting for the elevator.
-Press the button, Doris.

107
00:10:04,213 --> 00:10:05,407
Her brother Harvey.

108
00:10:26,133 --> 00:10:28,966
Doesn't come, so now I'm getting mad.

109
00:11:07,693 --> 00:11:12,005
Finally it comes, so I get in.
Okay, and there's people all around.

110
00:11:12,173 --> 00:11:14,607
And they're looking right at me.

111
00:11:59,213 --> 00:12:03,047
Yeah, my father taught me. I'm not
supposed to talk about him right now.

112
00:12:03,213 --> 00:12:05,886
He's doing a little bit of work
for the government, but....

113
00:12:06,053 --> 00:12:10,126
My father is very, very famous.
He danced with the Rockettes.

114
00:12:10,613 --> 00:12:12,604
Sure. Would you begin, please?

115
00:12:14,093 --> 00:12:16,926
-I'll be doing "Swanee River" for you.
-Okay.

116
00:12:17,093 --> 00:12:19,561
And....

117
00:12:19,733 --> 00:12:24,443
Hon? "Swanee River," please.
Hit it.

118
00:12:28,533 --> 00:12:32,128
Doris, what would you do
if you don't make it?

119
00:12:32,693 --> 00:12:33,728
We'll make it.

120
00:12:34,293 --> 00:12:36,363
Next, please.

121
00:12:36,853 --> 00:12:39,651
But I that am not shaped
for sportive tricks...

122
00:12:39,813 --> 00:12:42,611
...nor made to court
an amorous looking glass...

123
00:12:42,773 --> 00:12:45,810
...I that am-- Cheated of--
Oh, I'm sorry.

124
00:13:01,613 --> 00:13:03,729
Why don't you try
the drama department.

125
00:13:03,933 --> 00:13:09,007
If again "it was not well cut,"
he'd answer, I spake not true:

126
00:13:09,173 --> 00:13:11,403
This is called the Reply Churlish.

127
00:13:11,733 --> 00:13:14,611
Nobody talks about it,
but there's a quota system.

128
00:13:14,773 --> 00:13:19,483
Your chances are better if you're black,
Puerto Rican or everything, like me.

129
00:13:19,653 --> 00:13:23,771
-I am Puerto Rican.
-Not on your paper you ain't, Garci.

130
00:13:23,933 --> 00:13:27,562
-Your daddy doing government work.
-That's the truth.

131
00:13:27,853 --> 00:13:31,846
And he left you his tap shoes, right?
Does he work for Pepsi-Cola too?

132
00:13:32,533 --> 00:13:33,568
Be careful.

133
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,373
-To the left. Left.
-Come the other way.

134
00:13:36,533 --> 00:13:38,125
All right.

135
00:13:38,293 --> 00:13:40,807
Easy, now. Straight back, Bruno?

136
00:13:42,573 --> 00:13:45,451
-Where do you want this at?
-Far corner.

137
00:13:47,813 --> 00:13:49,610
How do you do?

138
00:13:49,813 --> 00:13:51,565
Okay. Fine.

139
00:13:51,733 --> 00:13:55,806
Great. Look, I'll do that. You just go
and get the rest of the stuff, okay?

140
00:13:55,973 --> 00:13:57,964
Oh, Martelli. Bruno Martelli.

141
00:13:58,293 --> 00:14:01,490
Would you like to set up
your equipment, Mr. Martelli?

142
00:14:06,613 --> 00:14:08,126
Who taught you?

143
00:14:08,293 --> 00:14:13,811
Who taught me? My father taught me.
He's in Spain. He makes Westerns.

144
00:14:13,973 --> 00:14:18,125
-Why do you want to go to school here?
-Because Freddie went here.

145
00:14:18,373 --> 00:14:22,161
-Freddie?
-Freddie Prinze. He's the best.

146
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:25,928
-So you want to be an actor, huh?
-Yeah, sure, I want to be an actor.

147
00:14:26,093 --> 00:14:28,527
Judy, Judy, Judy.
Top of the world, Ma.

148
00:14:28,693 --> 00:14:33,164
We don't want you to perform. We want
to see who you are. You understand?

149
00:14:33,493 --> 00:14:35,643
-Right.
-Use your own experience.

150
00:14:36,013 --> 00:14:38,846
Be simple, be honest,
but most of all, be yourself.

151
00:14:39,453 --> 00:14:43,207
-Be honest. Be simple. Be yourself?
-Be yourself.

152
00:14:44,653 --> 00:14:48,851
I'm God, see? And God
is Puerto Rican, you got that? Now.

153
00:14:49,413 --> 00:14:53,406
God works in a <i>casa de</i> steam,
you know. It's a steam bath, right?

154
00:14:53,573 --> 00:14:59,443
And he's talking to this angel. This angel
is a computer. An electronic computer.

155
00:14:59,613 --> 00:15:04,243
I'm God, see? That's why I'm standing
on this chair, you got that? Good.

156
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:16,689
Does he wanna be a musician
or an airline pilot?

157
00:15:17,733 --> 00:15:21,487
Mr. Martelli. We are ready when you are.
Would you care to begin?

158
00:15:21,693 --> 00:15:24,207
Oh, okay. Sure.

159
00:15:48,173 --> 00:15:49,162
Mr. Martelli.

160
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:53,410
Mr. Martelli.

161
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:58,448
Mr. Martelli!

162
00:16:00,373 --> 00:16:03,888
Thank you. One instrument
at a time will be quite sufficient.

163
00:16:04,093 --> 00:16:06,766
I could do it in 4/4
if you prefer a disco beat.

164
00:17:31,893 --> 00:17:34,453
She's a disaster.

165
00:17:37,493 --> 00:17:43,045
Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?
Deny thy father and refuse thy name.

166
00:17:43,213 --> 00:17:45,966
Or, if thou wilt not,
be but sworn my love...

167
00:17:46,133 --> 00:17:50,763
...and then I'll no longer be a Capu--
Capu-- Capu-something.

168
00:17:50,933 --> 00:17:55,006
-Capulet.
-Like Cappelletti, the football player?

169
00:17:55,173 --> 00:17:57,243
-Something like that.
-That's what I mean.

170
00:18:01,453 --> 00:18:04,411
-Where's his application?
-He doesn't have one.

171
00:18:04,573 --> 00:18:06,689
Well, get him one.

172
00:18:24,093 --> 00:18:26,926
-What do you call that?
-Wicked.

173
00:18:39,093 --> 00:18:40,492
Thou art thyself.

174
00:18:40,653 --> 00:18:43,725
Thou art not a Montagoo--
Montagazz-- Who knows?

175
00:18:43,893 --> 00:18:49,411
This is the last day of auditions. We've
seen a lot of students. We're punchy.

176
00:18:49,613 --> 00:18:54,892
We're gonna take a break. Go next door
to Mrs. Shime. Have her audition you.

177
00:18:55,053 --> 00:18:58,045
-Right next door.
-I tell her that you sent me?

178
00:18:58,213 --> 00:19:00,044
-Yeah.
-All right.

179
00:19:00,213 --> 00:19:01,566
By the way...

180
00:19:01,733 --> 00:19:05,726
-...you were reading the girl's part.
-Shit.

181
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:10,601
-You're not into high school, remember?
-I'm into dancing.

182
00:19:10,773 --> 00:19:15,893
You're into ass, you mean. You don't
have to go to high school for that.

183
00:19:16,053 --> 00:19:20,843
-I was doing you a favor, remember?
-Some fat fucking favor.

184
00:19:22,013 --> 00:19:27,406
Take your things to the third floor.
Give your forms to the senior there.

185
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:32,204
Okay, you go downstairs, change
in the girls' room and wait for him.

186
00:19:32,373 --> 00:19:35,570
I'm through?
I don't have to dance anymore?

187
00:19:35,733 --> 00:19:38,611
Where you going, Leroy?
He's in and I'm out, right?

188
00:19:38,813 --> 00:19:44,604
Fuck you, Leroy! This was my audition,
remember? You're not into high school.

189
00:19:44,773 --> 00:19:50,131
We were rehearsing to get me into this
school, not you, you fucker! It's not fair!

190
00:19:50,293 --> 00:19:53,888
I didn't want to come here anyway.
This school sucks.

191
00:19:54,093 --> 00:19:56,209
You've done me a favor, shithead.

192
00:19:56,413 --> 00:20:00,486
You saved me four fucking years
from this ass-licking school!

193
00:20:00,693 --> 00:20:03,890
You looking at one happy lady!

194
00:20:05,093 --> 00:20:08,688
Who wants to go to a fucking school
to learn to dance, anyway?

195
00:20:10,413 --> 00:20:12,051
Yeah, hello?

196
00:20:12,213 --> 00:20:17,492
No, it isn't. This is Naomi Finsecker
speaking. Her mother. Who is this?

197
00:20:26,813 --> 00:20:31,091
Replacement?
What do you mean, replacement?

198
00:20:34,973 --> 00:20:37,567
So is she in or is she out?

199
00:20:40,533 --> 00:20:43,650
I got in! I got in!
I got into Performing Arts!

200
00:20:48,213 --> 00:20:50,773
Doris, we're in!

201
00:21:38,933 --> 00:21:41,493
Get her out of there!

202
00:21:44,653 --> 00:21:48,362
-Hey, later on.
-All right. All right!

203
00:21:48,533 --> 00:21:50,763
See y'all later.

204
00:21:51,493 --> 00:21:54,565
-Hello.
-Hey, mama, get in the car!

205
00:21:58,293 --> 00:22:01,683
Come on, baby, come on.
Don't go to school.

206
00:22:01,853 --> 00:22:05,163
<i>-Martelli, Bruno.</i>
-Bruno. Come on.

207
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:07,051
<i>Garcia, Raul.</i>

208
00:22:08,293 --> 00:22:11,410
-Garcia, Raul?
-It's Ralph.

209
00:22:13,013 --> 00:22:15,732
-It says Raul.
-I don't relate to that.

210
00:22:16,893 --> 00:22:19,726
-Garcia, Ralph.
-It's Garci.

211
00:22:19,893 --> 00:22:23,806
Ralph Garci. I think they
spelled it wrong on the application.

212
00:22:23,973 --> 00:22:26,441
-Garci, Ralph.
-Here.

213
00:22:29,013 --> 00:22:31,243
-MacNeil, Montgomery.
-Here.

214
00:22:31,813 --> 00:22:34,771
-Monroe, Lisa.
-Yes?

215
00:22:36,213 --> 00:22:37,328
Johnson, Leroy.

216
00:22:39,453 --> 00:22:40,772
Johnson, Leroy?

217
00:22:42,933 --> 00:22:47,688
In future, Mr. Johnson, I'd like you to
leave your ghetto blaster at home.

218
00:22:48,053 --> 00:22:51,568
I'd have left it home
if it wasn't so goddamn boring in here.

219
00:22:52,213 --> 00:22:57,890
This is a classroom, Mr. Johnson. You're
going to be here for four years...

220
00:22:58,053 --> 00:23:01,363
...with your eyes open,
homework done, pencils sharpened...

221
00:23:01,533 --> 00:23:07,085
...and all food, cigarettes and radios
outside. Do you understand me?

222
00:23:08,933 --> 00:23:12,642
-Why are you here, Mr. Johnson?
-Because l's young and single...

223
00:23:12,813 --> 00:23:15,805
-...and I loves to mingle.
-Speak English.

224
00:23:15,973 --> 00:23:20,285
-I speak like I likes.
-This is my room. You'll speak as I like.

225
00:23:20,453 --> 00:23:24,810
I teach English. Now, if that's
a foreign language, you're gonna learn it.

226
00:23:26,853 --> 00:23:31,847
This is no Mickey Mouse school. You
won't get off easy because of talent.

227
00:23:32,053 --> 00:23:36,012
-I don't care how well you dance...
-Bitch run her fucking mouth.

228
00:23:36,213 --> 00:23:40,172
...or how many colored tutus you have.
If you don't give academic subjects...

229
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:44,042
-...equal time, you're out.
-Bullshit.

230
00:23:44,213 --> 00:23:47,569
You have to arrive earlier
to get dressed and warmed up.

231
00:23:47,733 --> 00:23:50,884
You have to take outside classes
in your major field...

232
00:23:51,053 --> 00:23:55,729
...and study ballet, modern, folk,
jazz, tap and historical dance here...

233
00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:58,566
...as well as dance history,
supported adagio...

234
00:23:58,893 --> 00:24:03,887
...variation class, makeup, hairstyling
and even acting for dancers.

235
00:24:04,053 --> 00:24:09,207
50,000 people call themselves actors,
and maybe 500 are making a living at it.

236
00:24:09,373 --> 00:24:13,366
Most of those do commercials to
pay the rent. The rest wait tables...

237
00:24:13,533 --> 00:24:17,765
...clean other people's apartments,
living on welfare and hope.

238
00:24:17,933 --> 00:24:20,208
Don't think talent's enough
to get you through.

239
00:24:20,373 --> 00:24:24,685
You gotta have a strong technique,
a good agent, and most of all, thick skin.

240
00:24:24,893 --> 00:24:28,966
Now you're part of an underprivileged
minority, and you're going to suffer.

241
00:24:29,173 --> 00:24:33,325
Pulled tendons, shin splints,
swollen toes, smelly tights....

242
00:24:33,493 --> 00:24:36,803
Cattle calls, the humiliation,
the rejection....

243
00:24:36,973 --> 00:24:42,127
Melodic dictation theory, keyboard
harmony, piano, piano literature...

244
00:24:42,293 --> 00:24:48,050
...music history, orchestration,
conducting, symphonic band....

245
00:24:48,213 --> 00:24:51,728
-When do we have lunch?
-Lunch is at 11 :30. One half-hour...

246
00:24:51,893 --> 00:24:54,930
-...and then you'll have everything else.
-What's everything else?

247
00:24:55,093 --> 00:25:00,213
Biology, chemistry, algebra, English,
French, physics, history, et cetera.

248
00:25:00,573 --> 00:25:03,645
Dance is not a way
of getting through school.

249
00:25:03,813 --> 00:25:07,965
It's a way of life, plus school.
The school part is easier.

250
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:12,371
So you better like yourself a lot.
Because that's all you got to work with.

251
00:25:12,533 --> 00:25:16,412
Use yourself.
Your voice, your experiences.

252
00:25:16,573 --> 00:25:21,328
Wanna accumulate some experiences?
I got plenty of experiences to spare.

253
00:25:22,893 --> 00:25:26,408
You know what?
I live with two chicks.

254
00:25:26,613 --> 00:25:29,446
Dance is the hardest
department in the school.

255
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:32,121
Acting is the hardest
profession in the world.

256
00:25:32,333 --> 00:25:37,726
Music is the hardest profession of
them all. Isn't that right, Mrs. Tossoff?

257
00:25:37,893 --> 00:25:38,928
Indeed.

258
00:26:32,573 --> 00:26:34,131
Okay.

259
00:26:36,973 --> 00:26:39,407
No fighting. Stay in line, please.

260
00:26:40,973 --> 00:26:42,008
Who's next?

261
00:26:51,973 --> 00:26:53,691
Excuse me.

262
00:26:55,133 --> 00:26:59,172
-I'll be doing my scene Thursday....
-I'll be right back.

263
00:27:05,213 --> 00:27:06,726
Get out of my seat!

264
00:30:55,013 --> 00:30:59,211
-Hi.
-Hi. That's too wild for me.

265
00:31:00,253 --> 00:31:02,926
-I'm in your acting class.
-I know.

266
00:31:03,093 --> 00:31:05,163
Montgomery MacNeil.

267
00:31:05,813 --> 00:31:08,771
-Doris Finsecker.
-Hi. Wanna sit down?

268
00:31:08,933 --> 00:31:13,370
All right. Is your mother really
Marsha MacNeil, the actress?

269
00:31:13,533 --> 00:31:15,649
-That's right.
-She does wonderful work.

270
00:31:15,973 --> 00:31:18,567
-Have you seen her?
-But I've heard.

271
00:31:20,813 --> 00:31:24,488
-I didn't know she lived in New York.
-She doesn't. Officially, she does...

272
00:31:24,653 --> 00:31:28,931
...but she's been on the road forever.
She gets paid to stay in hotels...

273
00:31:29,093 --> 00:31:33,006
...but she stays with friends. Sends her
per diems home to me and Dr. Golden.

274
00:31:33,253 --> 00:31:36,802
-ls that your stepfather?
-My analyst.

275
00:31:38,133 --> 00:31:40,249
What's wrong with you?

276
00:31:40,693 --> 00:31:43,890
It's pretty technical, really.
I have problems.

277
00:31:47,493 --> 00:31:50,769
-What kind of problems?
-With women.

278
00:31:57,533 --> 00:32:01,128
Fine. Swaying with a nice humming
sound, please. And:

279
00:32:02,973 --> 00:32:04,565
Let the arms go.

280
00:32:09,333 --> 00:32:12,530
Good, good, good.
And chew.

281
00:32:14,773 --> 00:32:16,172
Faster.

282
00:32:16,733 --> 00:32:18,689
Speed.

283
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:21,413
Tongues out.
Down.

284
00:32:21,613 --> 00:32:23,092
Side. Side.

285
00:32:23,293 --> 00:32:26,126
And round, round.
Come on.

286
00:32:35,693 --> 00:32:38,287
More energy!

287
00:32:40,933 --> 00:32:43,731
Do it together, please.
Keep moving.

288
00:32:44,213 --> 00:32:47,967
Much better.
Much, much better now.

289
00:32:54,453 --> 00:32:56,011
Reach for the jeté!

290
00:32:56,773 --> 00:32:59,333
And:

291
00:32:59,493 --> 00:33:02,530
lmpulse to impulse.

292
00:33:37,533 --> 00:33:38,932
Relax.

293
00:33:40,093 --> 00:33:41,492
Relax.

294
00:33:41,933 --> 00:33:45,369
Sense the floor against your bodies.

295
00:33:46,133 --> 00:33:49,250
Feel it against
the backs of your legs.

296
00:33:49,773 --> 00:33:51,331
Your arms.

297
00:33:52,093 --> 00:33:53,765
Your shoulders.

298
00:33:54,173 --> 00:33:56,767
Let your senses remember...

299
00:33:56,933 --> 00:34:00,403
...this feeling of heaviness.

300
00:34:01,013 --> 00:34:04,369
Relax and breathe.

301
00:34:05,173 --> 00:34:09,007
Relax and breathe.

302
00:34:10,773 --> 00:34:15,972
All right, let's go. Thank you.
Don't be late. Come on. Don't be late.

303
00:34:37,693 --> 00:34:40,526
-Should you be on this floor?
-I have a note.

304
00:34:40,693 --> 00:34:43,730
-Miss Berg wants a tambourine.
-Fine.

305
00:34:47,413 --> 00:34:50,962
Excuse me? Excuse me?
You speak English?

306
00:34:51,133 --> 00:34:53,203
-Bruno Martelli?
-He's across the hall.

307
00:34:53,373 --> 00:34:54,931
Thanks.

308
00:34:59,573 --> 00:35:02,041
-Hi.
-Hi.

309
00:35:03,733 --> 00:35:06,850
-What kind of music notes are those?
-Laser beams.

310
00:35:07,013 --> 00:35:10,767
-It's a requiem for Buck Rogers.
-Great.

311
00:35:11,493 --> 00:35:15,247
-You ever thought of doing real music?
-This is my music.

312
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:18,291
-I mean a band.
-I don't like bands. They crowd me.

313
00:35:18,453 --> 00:35:22,685
-I prefer my basement, no people.
-There's money though, in summer trade.

314
00:35:22,853 --> 00:35:25,765
-lf we get together in time.
-I'm really not interested.

315
00:35:25,933 --> 00:35:29,608
There's tea dances and parties,
weddings and bar mitzvahs.

316
00:35:29,773 --> 00:35:33,561
Those things are steady. People always
get married and grow up.

317
00:35:33,733 --> 00:35:36,691
-I don't need the hassle.
-I'll take care of everything...

318
00:35:36,853 --> 00:35:38,923
...just like a regular business manager.

319
00:35:39,093 --> 00:35:43,325
I'll look after the bookings, travel,
costume designs, for 10% off the top.

320
00:35:43,493 --> 00:35:45,563
Then a straight split
of the performing cut.

321
00:35:45,733 --> 00:35:49,692
-What costume designs?
-Nothing fancy, just sequins and stuff.

322
00:35:49,853 --> 00:35:53,163
See-through for me, maybe low-cut.
We gotta give them visuals.

323
00:35:53,333 --> 00:35:58,453
The sound might be wicked, but when
you get down to it, tits book bands.

324
00:35:58,613 --> 00:36:02,367
-I think I'll stay in my basement.
-Bruno, this is our chance.

325
00:36:02,533 --> 00:36:07,891
-Don't you want success?
-Sure. I don't think our tits are up to it.

326
00:36:13,173 --> 00:36:14,845
Why?

327
00:36:15,813 --> 00:36:18,407
Oh, why?

328
00:36:20,333 --> 00:36:24,042
God will punish you,
Yuri Yajeyopeyonoff.

329
00:36:25,333 --> 00:36:28,530
What crime is this unborn
child guilty of...

330
00:36:28,693 --> 00:36:31,605
...that it should not drink of
the milk of paradise?

331
00:36:31,773 --> 00:36:35,482
You warned me, Elena.
Not one ruble have I lost, not one.

332
00:36:39,533 --> 00:36:44,049
-Can we try this again? It sounds phony.
-I don't wanna try this again.

333
00:36:44,213 --> 00:36:48,092
-There's nothing wrong with you.
-I know. That's what's wrong with me.

334
00:36:48,253 --> 00:36:53,805
Everybody here is colorful or eccentric
or charismatic. I'm perfectly ordinary.

335
00:36:53,973 --> 00:36:59,525
My nose is ordinary. My body's ordinary.
And my voice, it's--

336
00:37:00,053 --> 00:37:02,692
-I don't know why I'm here.
-You wanna be an actress.

337
00:37:02,853 --> 00:37:07,131
Yeah, but actors and actresses
are colorful, flamboyant beings.

338
00:37:07,413 --> 00:37:10,564
I'm about as flamboyant as a bagel.

339
00:37:11,093 --> 00:37:12,287
Hi.

340
00:37:12,453 --> 00:37:14,444
-Hi.
-Hi.

341
00:37:15,093 --> 00:37:18,130
-Some people like bagels.
-Some people don't.

342
00:37:18,293 --> 00:37:21,410
-Some people are too old for you.
-He smiles at me.

343
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:24,531
-He smiles at everyone.
-Yeah, but he winks too.

344
00:37:24,693 --> 00:37:27,890
-I think it's a nervous habit.
-He talks to me, often.

345
00:37:28,173 --> 00:37:30,892
-Really? What's he say?
-Hi.

346
00:37:31,173 --> 00:37:34,245
That's serious. Have you set the date?

347
00:37:37,373 --> 00:37:39,329
I'm sorry.

348
00:37:40,293 --> 00:37:42,568
-I'm sorry.
-I feel stupid.

349
00:37:42,733 --> 00:37:43,768
So get into it.

350
00:37:43,933 --> 00:37:46,163
Study it. Try to remember it
so you can--

351
00:37:46,293 --> 00:37:47,282
Hey, M and M.

352
00:37:47,453 --> 00:37:49,205
Seen your shrink lately?

353
00:37:49,493 --> 00:37:52,053
-Yesterday.
-You got a special delivery?

354
00:37:52,453 --> 00:37:54,171
How you doing? How are you?

355
00:37:55,493 --> 00:37:58,132
Oh, good. That's very good.
You're a good man.

356
00:37:58,933 --> 00:38:01,493
They're not for me.
They're for a friend of mine.

357
00:38:03,213 --> 00:38:04,646
Who's the lucky fella, huh?

358
00:38:05,253 --> 00:38:08,484
Looks like somebody finally
corked up old Finsecker.

359
00:38:08,813 --> 00:38:11,407
It can't be Gloria over here.
He's not into chicks.

360
00:38:15,173 --> 00:38:16,526
Shut my mouth.

361
00:38:18,093 --> 00:38:19,082
Bye.

362
00:38:20,413 --> 00:38:22,802
I hate Ralph Garci, I really do.

363
00:38:23,253 --> 00:38:25,813
I must remember this feeling
and use it in my acting.

364
00:38:28,933 --> 00:38:30,127
I'm scared.

365
00:38:30,293 --> 00:38:34,764
I'm scared I won't be able to live up
to their expectations of me.

366
00:38:37,053 --> 00:38:39,362
Flashing images of passion--

367
00:38:42,493 --> 00:38:46,452
--and hurl you to the ground
and make mad, passionate love.

368
00:38:47,413 --> 00:38:49,324
-I forgot it!
-For two weeks?

369
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:52,371
-I told you, I done it and I forgot it.
-My hearing's fine.

370
00:38:52,533 --> 00:38:56,606
It's your homework that's missing.
And these pages are unintelligible.

371
00:38:57,413 --> 00:39:00,450
It's a secret language.
It ain't meant for whiteys.

372
00:39:00,613 --> 00:39:02,843
-This isn't a joke.
-I got lots of jokes.

373
00:39:03,173 --> 00:39:05,607
-This is garbage!
-My pen broke.

374
00:39:05,813 --> 00:39:08,691
-It's in pencil.
-That broke too.

375
00:39:08,853 --> 00:39:11,492
You can't learn to read,
you can't learn to dance.

376
00:39:11,733 --> 00:39:13,963
You're flunking out.

377
00:39:14,133 --> 00:39:15,202
I can read.

378
00:39:15,373 --> 00:39:18,206
Terrific! Go ahead, surprise us.
Give him your book.

379
00:39:18,373 --> 00:39:20,648
Pay attention.
Mr. Johnson is gonna read.

380
00:39:21,573 --> 00:39:23,882
-I said I can read!
-Then read.

381
00:39:25,013 --> 00:39:26,446
-No.
-Read!

382
00:39:26,773 --> 00:39:28,047
-No!
-Read!

383
00:39:28,213 --> 00:39:29,532
No, you fucking bitch!

384
00:39:29,693 --> 00:39:34,130
What the fuck you want me to do,
asking me to read all the fucking time?

385
00:39:34,293 --> 00:39:36,682
I hate your guts. You read,
you fucking bitch!

386
00:40:43,013 --> 00:40:44,128
It's not natural.

387
00:40:44,293 --> 00:40:46,363
Get off my case, huh, Papa?

388
00:40:47,413 --> 00:40:51,247
When I was your age, Bruno,
I had a lot of girlfriends.

389
00:40:51,413 --> 00:40:54,291
-I had a different girlfriend every day.
-I got music.

390
00:40:55,253 --> 00:40:57,164
Same to you, pal! Go ahead.

391
00:40:57,333 --> 00:41:01,645
Go ahead! Oh, sure, you got music,
okay. But for what? For yourself.

392
00:41:01,773 --> 00:41:02,762
For your headset.

393
00:41:03,013 --> 00:41:06,449
I mean, do I hear it anymore?
Does your mama hear it?

394
00:41:06,613 --> 00:41:07,887
Do your friends hear it?

395
00:41:08,213 --> 00:41:10,204
Bruno, do you have friends? Huh?

396
00:41:10,373 --> 00:41:14,127
-I don't have time. I told you.
-You told me. You told me.

397
00:41:14,293 --> 00:41:17,171
It's not natural. When I was your age,
I'm telling you--

398
00:41:17,333 --> 00:41:20,211
You're not my age. Nobody's my age.
I'm ahead of my time.

399
00:41:20,373 --> 00:41:22,364
Maybe I don't think
people will like my stuff.

400
00:41:22,533 --> 00:41:27,004
How do you know what people will like?
How do they know if they don't hear it?

401
00:41:27,173 --> 00:41:30,768
Bruno, how do they recognize your talent
and give you scholarships...

402
00:41:30,933 --> 00:41:33,163
...and record contracts, son,
and awards?

403
00:41:33,493 --> 00:41:36,929
Maybe I die undiscovered,
and my ghost gets the Grammy.

404
00:41:37,093 --> 00:41:41,484
Maybe! Look, did I build you a studio
in the basement for a ghost?

405
00:41:41,653 --> 00:41:45,168
Did I spent $ 7000 on equipment
for a ghost?

406
00:41:45,413 --> 00:41:50,282
Does your mama cook and clean and
wear old clothes for a ghost? A ghost?

407
00:41:50,453 --> 00:41:53,729
Elton John's mom has got
six mink coats.

408
00:43:02,933 --> 00:43:08,690
"Wel-- Wel-- Welcome to...

409
00:43:08,853 --> 00:43:12,528
...the wo-- Won--

410
00:43:12,693 --> 00:43:16,845
Wonderful...

411
00:43:17,013 --> 00:43:21,165
...world of...

412
00:43:21,333 --> 00:43:26,851
...Ma-- Maytag...

413
00:43:27,013 --> 00:43:31,086
...wash-- Wash-- Washing...

414
00:43:31,253 --> 00:43:34,211
...mach-- Ma--

415
00:43:34,373 --> 00:43:36,523
Machines. "

416
00:44:14,293 --> 00:44:15,567
Talk about Shorofsky.

417
00:44:15,733 --> 00:44:21,365
Mr. Shorofsky does not understand any
music past Mozart when he was 2.

418
00:44:21,533 --> 00:44:23,569
They're all the same.
What do you expect?

419
00:44:24,573 --> 00:44:29,010
Graduating from P.A. is no Academy
Award. You know what I mean.

420
00:44:29,733 --> 00:44:33,487
It is better than real school. It's free,
and you don't get raped in the hallways.

421
00:44:33,653 --> 00:44:36,213
But it's still small change.

422
00:44:36,373 --> 00:44:39,570
I'm just killing time here,
waiting for my opportunity.

423
00:44:39,733 --> 00:44:42,372
It might be a movie
or a Broadway musical.

424
00:44:42,533 --> 00:44:45,093
But it's coming. I keep my eyes open.

425
00:44:45,253 --> 00:44:48,290
I read <i>Back Stage, Show Business</i>
and <i>Variety.</i>

426
00:44:48,453 --> 00:44:50,603
You see, I do the whole thing.

427
00:44:50,773 --> 00:44:53,970
Dancing's just the tip
of this iceberg.

428
00:44:54,133 --> 00:44:57,409
A friend of my sister,
she tells fortunes and stuff.

429
00:44:57,573 --> 00:45:00,929
She says I'm doing my last dance
on this dark little planet.

430
00:45:01,093 --> 00:45:03,288
So it's gotta be spectacular, you know?

431
00:45:03,453 --> 00:45:06,047
How bright our spirits
go shooting out into space...

432
00:45:06,213 --> 00:45:10,331
...depends on how much we contributed
to the earthly brilliance of this world.

433
00:45:10,493 --> 00:45:14,202
And I mean to be a major contributor.

434
00:45:15,333 --> 00:45:17,483
A sure-as-shit major contributor.

435
00:45:24,213 --> 00:45:26,852
-Can someone just--?
-She's cleaning her cleavage.

436
00:45:27,013 --> 00:45:31,325
She's taking out the lint. Oh,
that's beautiful. I wish I had a camera.

437
00:45:31,493 --> 00:45:34,644
There she is. Get out of the way.
She's gorgeous.

438
00:45:34,813 --> 00:45:37,008
Oh, now turn around, please.

439
00:45:37,333 --> 00:45:38,846
Oh, please.

440
00:45:39,013 --> 00:45:40,526
Oh, look at those tits.

441
00:45:40,853 --> 00:45:42,366
Oh, you could drown in those.

442
00:45:42,533 --> 00:45:47,732
<i>I want you to observe yourself</i>
<i>doing ordinary, everyday things.</i>

443
00:45:48,213 --> 00:45:50,773
You'll be asked to duplicate
those here in class.

444
00:45:50,933 --> 00:45:53,208
An actor must develop
an acute sense memory...

445
00:45:53,373 --> 00:45:57,651
...so concentrate on how you deal
with things in your world...

446
00:45:57,813 --> 00:46:01,886
...how you wash your face
or hold your fork or lift your cup...

447
00:46:02,053 --> 00:46:07,332
...comb your hair. Observe and study
your own mechanicalness.

448
00:46:07,493 --> 00:46:12,123
See if you can catch yourself in the
very act of doing or saying something.

449
00:46:13,253 --> 00:46:17,963
See if your actions and reactions fall into
patterns and what those patterns are.

450
00:46:18,133 --> 00:46:21,728
And in particular, pay close attention
to the physical world.

451
00:46:21,893 --> 00:46:25,886
Isolate and concentrate on the details.

452
00:46:37,253 --> 00:46:39,721
Oh, <i>mamacita</i>!

453
00:46:44,053 --> 00:46:45,566
<i>Ay, caramba!</i>

454
00:46:52,693 --> 00:46:56,129
No! No! No! Give me that!

455
00:46:56,293 --> 00:46:58,853
You must hold your bow like this,
not like that.

456
00:46:59,013 --> 00:47:00,810
It's not your dick you're holding.

457
00:47:00,973 --> 00:47:05,091
Excuse me, miss. It's a violin bow.
Hold it with a little respect, like--

458
00:47:05,253 --> 00:47:07,084
Like your dick?

459
00:47:07,253 --> 00:47:09,403
Shut up. Again.

460
00:47:39,253 --> 00:47:42,211
Watch your plié, Coco.

461
00:47:43,333 --> 00:47:46,848
Turn out the arch, Leroy.

462
00:47:47,333 --> 00:47:48,766
Nice, Neisha.

463
00:47:50,213 --> 00:47:52,329
I want to see the leg, Patrick.

464
00:47:52,493 --> 00:47:55,644
And stretch.

465
00:47:57,493 --> 00:47:59,085
Good.

466
00:48:00,453 --> 00:48:02,125
Keep it together now.

467
00:48:06,933 --> 00:48:10,767
Where's the sweat, Lisa?
You're not even trying.

468
00:48:25,333 --> 00:48:28,131
-Michael, congratulations. I heard.
-Oh, thank you.

469
00:48:28,293 --> 00:48:31,330
Don't thank me. You deserved
the award and the scholarship.

470
00:48:31,493 --> 00:48:33,802
You are the best actor in the school.

471
00:48:33,973 --> 00:48:36,771
Well, you were the best actor
in the school.

472
00:48:36,933 --> 00:48:39,083
I mean, we'll miss you.

473
00:48:39,253 --> 00:48:40,527
Well, I'll miss you too.

474
00:48:40,773 --> 00:48:42,047
-You will?
-Yeah, sure.

475
00:48:42,213 --> 00:48:44,443
-We'll keep in touch, I guess, huh?
-Yeah.

476
00:48:44,853 --> 00:48:46,206
Would you sign my yearbook?

477
00:48:46,373 --> 00:48:49,809
Yeah, all right. Do you
want me to sign my picture?

478
00:48:49,973 --> 00:48:52,487
-That'd be great.
-Oh, okay.

479
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:55,083
-I forgot. What's your name?
-Doris Finsecker.

480
00:48:55,253 --> 00:48:57,323
-Oh, right. Doris.
-But Doris is enough.

481
00:48:57,453 --> 00:48:58,442
Oh, okay.

482
00:48:58,613 --> 00:49:01,081
-Have you decided where you're going?
-California.

483
00:49:01,253 --> 00:49:04,211
-I mean to college, the scholarship.
-I can't use it.

484
00:49:04,373 --> 00:49:07,012
-How come?
-William Morris has got big plans for me.

485
00:49:07,173 --> 00:49:09,812
-They saw me in that Senior Day show.
-You're kidding?

486
00:49:09,973 --> 00:49:12,931
-They wanna represent me.
-They're the biggest agents.

487
00:49:13,093 --> 00:49:15,084
-Yeah.
-Well, that's great!

488
00:49:16,333 --> 00:49:18,767
There's a couple of series
they think I'm right for.

489
00:49:18,933 --> 00:49:22,528
I've had a lot of really good meetings.
Everyone's very excited.

490
00:49:22,693 --> 00:49:25,253
That is so great!
I mean, Hollywood, that's like--

491
00:49:25,413 --> 00:49:30,771
Yeah. Well, here I go,
off into the sunset.

492
00:49:30,933 --> 00:49:33,083
Hey, good luck. Oh, sorry.

493
00:49:33,253 --> 00:49:36,848
I mean, break a leg,
or whatever they say.

494
00:49:39,253 --> 00:49:40,766
See you.

495
00:49:41,813 --> 00:49:43,565
Hey!

496
00:49:44,053 --> 00:49:45,486
We'll see you at Schwab's.

497
00:49:49,493 --> 00:49:51,006
Oh, God, Doris!

498
00:50:04,293 --> 00:50:06,363
She's new. I saw her arrive
in a limousine.

499
00:50:06,533 --> 00:50:08,763
A limousine? No kidding?

500
00:50:10,053 --> 00:50:13,250
-Man, I hope to fuck she's in drama.
-No way. Dance department.

501
00:50:13,413 --> 00:50:15,802
She's too beautiful. Look at that ass.

502
00:50:15,973 --> 00:50:19,966
-I don't know about her tits.
-What do you mean? What kind of tits?

503
00:50:22,533 --> 00:50:24,842
-Tits.... Pointy ones?
-She looks kind of flat.

504
00:50:25,013 --> 00:50:26,207
She's fucking gorgeous!

505
00:50:26,373 --> 00:50:28,523
Little-bitty ones
with nips like raisins?

506
00:50:28,693 --> 00:50:31,002
She's turning around. Look at that ass.

507
00:50:31,173 --> 00:50:34,051
-Oh, she is a dancer.
-Let me up. Let me up!

508
00:50:38,453 --> 00:50:40,842
Let me see, you fuckers.

509
00:50:49,813 --> 00:50:52,611
<i>Last year, we worked</i>
<i>on simple observations.</i>

510
00:50:52,853 --> 00:50:57,244
This year, we're going to turn
that observation inward...

511
00:50:57,413 --> 00:51:00,132
...and work on re-creating
emotional states:

512
00:51:00,293 --> 00:51:04,047
Fear, joy, sorrow, anger.

513
00:51:04,213 --> 00:51:09,207
And it'll be more difficult because you'll
have to expose more of you...

514
00:51:09,373 --> 00:51:12,046
...what's on the inside of you.

515
00:51:12,213 --> 00:51:15,011
For your first acting exercise
this year, I want you...

516
00:51:15,173 --> 00:51:18,370
...to re-create a difficult memory...

517
00:51:18,533 --> 00:51:23,004
...a painful moment when you learned
something about yourself that hurt.

518
00:51:23,173 --> 00:51:26,449
And I mean really hurt.

519
00:51:26,613 --> 00:51:28,604
And reach.

520
00:51:29,413 --> 00:51:32,371
And through. And drop.

521
00:51:32,533 --> 00:51:34,842
And back.

522
00:51:40,613 --> 00:51:42,729
Hi, I'm Lisa Monroe.

523
00:51:43,893 --> 00:51:45,167
Hilary van Doren.

524
00:51:45,493 --> 00:51:46,767
I love your coat.

525
00:51:46,933 --> 00:51:48,491
I saw that in Bendel's window.

526
00:51:49,573 --> 00:51:53,168
-My stepmother bought it for me.
-Really?

527
00:51:53,333 --> 00:51:56,211
I wouldn't mind that kind of stepmother.

528
00:51:56,853 --> 00:52:00,528
She didn't do it for me.
She wants my father to think she cares.

529
00:52:00,693 --> 00:52:03,332
Besides, she loves shopping.

530
00:52:03,493 --> 00:52:06,610
She gets multiple orgasm
every time she buys something.

531
00:52:07,093 --> 00:52:09,163
Sounds great. I think I like her.

532
00:52:09,333 --> 00:52:10,607
You can have her.

533
00:52:11,013 --> 00:52:14,369
-Where's all the sweat, Lisa?
-I'm working on it.

534
00:52:14,853 --> 00:52:17,083
You're not working on it hard enough.

535
00:52:17,253 --> 00:52:19,209
Get rid of the gum.

536
00:52:30,053 --> 00:52:31,532
Watch me.

537
00:52:33,973 --> 00:52:35,884
Lift the bow off the string, Martelli.

538
00:52:36,373 --> 00:52:38,364
Mozart wouldn't do this today.

539
00:52:38,533 --> 00:52:40,603
-Do what?
-This bowing business.

540
00:52:40,773 --> 00:52:42,650
He'd plug his keyboard into an amp...

541
00:52:42,813 --> 00:52:45,885
...and he'd have string quartets
coming out of his fingers.

542
00:52:46,213 --> 00:52:49,330
And who would play all these
science-fiction symphonies?

543
00:52:49,893 --> 00:52:52,043
-He would.
-All by himself?

544
00:52:52,453 --> 00:52:55,968
He'd overdub and mix, of course.
He wouldn't make the same old noise.

545
00:52:56,133 --> 00:52:57,964
-Noise?
-He'd sound electric.

546
00:52:58,133 --> 00:53:02,251
He'd have spacier strings and horns
and computerized bassoons.

547
00:53:02,693 --> 00:53:05,605
-One man is not an orchestra.
-Who needs orchestras?

548
00:53:05,773 --> 00:53:09,891
You can do it all with a keyboard,
an amp and enough power.

549
00:53:10,453 --> 00:53:12,728
You're going to play all by yourself?

550
00:53:12,893 --> 00:53:14,292
You don't need anybody else.

551
00:53:14,693 --> 00:53:18,129
That's not music, Martelli.
That's masturbation.

552
00:53:20,053 --> 00:53:22,613
See, I'm not naturally graceful.

553
00:53:22,933 --> 00:53:24,969
Grace doesn't run in our family.

554
00:53:25,133 --> 00:53:28,921
It's our genes. I've had to work
so hard to come this far.

555
00:53:29,093 --> 00:53:31,891
-God, I've been at it since I was 4.
-Me too.

556
00:53:32,053 --> 00:53:33,964
I started out with tap and stuff.

557
00:53:34,133 --> 00:53:37,967
Then my mom kept buying me pretty
ballet tutus, and I got hooked on it.

558
00:53:38,133 --> 00:53:40,852
Less lip, Monroe! More sweat!

559
00:53:41,413 --> 00:53:43,643
-She's just a bitch.
-She hates me.

560
00:53:43,813 --> 00:53:47,362
This is a dance class, Lisa,
not the Charles Atlas plan.

561
00:53:47,653 --> 00:53:50,850
-Shut your mouth.
-Where are your tights?

562
00:53:51,093 --> 00:53:53,084
I told you I got them.
I just forgot them.

563
00:53:53,253 --> 00:53:54,845
What's he talking about?

564
00:53:55,013 --> 00:53:57,083
Tights. He won't wear them.

565
00:53:58,373 --> 00:54:02,924
Look, Leroy, I told you, if you don't have
tights, you don't dance. Now go!

566
00:54:06,533 --> 00:54:08,649
Oh, I love your accent.
What did you say?

567
00:54:08,813 --> 00:54:10,371
I dig his black ass.

568
00:54:10,533 --> 00:54:14,845
-It's taken, Goldilocks.
-Don't count on it.

569
00:54:24,933 --> 00:54:26,207
A painful memory.

570
00:54:26,373 --> 00:54:29,012
What does he mean by
a painful memory?

571
00:54:29,173 --> 00:54:31,482
I don't know. I can't find
a painful memory.

572
00:54:31,653 --> 00:54:33,006
I know I have them.

573
00:54:33,173 --> 00:54:35,971
I mean, my pain's as good
as anybody else's.

574
00:54:36,133 --> 00:54:39,250
I have lots of them. You can borrow
one of mine if you want.

575
00:54:39,413 --> 00:54:43,884
Like, I used to wet my bed. There, that
was painful. You can have that memory.

576
00:54:44,053 --> 00:54:45,327
No, thank you.

577
00:54:45,493 --> 00:54:49,327
Then there was the last time my father
packed his bags and left us.

578
00:54:49,493 --> 00:54:51,324
That really was painful.

579
00:54:51,493 --> 00:54:57,011
Or the first time my mother flew to L.A.
and didn't come back for six weeks.

580
00:54:57,253 --> 00:54:59,972
Or the first time I fell in love.

581
00:55:00,133 --> 00:55:02,442
Where'd that come from?

582
00:55:03,013 --> 00:55:05,004
I'll buy you a cup of coffee.

583
00:56:37,813 --> 00:56:39,405
You're gonna tell everybody that?

584
00:56:40,053 --> 00:56:42,442
It's the most painful memory
I can think of.

585
00:56:42,613 --> 00:56:45,252
He didn't say the most painful.
He just said painful.

586
00:56:45,413 --> 00:56:49,247
-We're supposed to expose ourselves.
-lmagine what Ralph Garci will say.

587
00:56:49,573 --> 00:56:53,885
A pie in the face comes with the job.
That's what my mom says. She knows.

588
00:56:54,053 --> 00:56:55,247
I don't get it.

589
00:56:55,413 --> 00:56:59,292
A real artist must never be afraid of
what other people will say about him.

590
00:56:59,453 --> 00:57:02,126
It was a time when I realized
something about myself.

591
00:57:02,373 --> 00:57:05,092
-Maybe you didn't realize it right.
-What do you mean?

592
00:57:05,333 --> 00:57:08,962
Well, I mean, everybody falls in love
with their analyst.

593
00:57:09,253 --> 00:57:11,813
There's a word for that, isn't there?

594
00:57:11,973 --> 00:57:14,362
Homosexual.

595
00:58:07,973 --> 00:58:09,645
That's my music.

596
00:58:09,813 --> 00:58:11,565
That lunatic stole my tape.

597
00:58:20,933 --> 00:58:22,332
Wow, that's me.

598
00:58:23,653 --> 00:58:29,011
That's my son's music!
My son Bruno. Bruno Martelli!

599
00:58:29,173 --> 00:58:33,086
He wrote the music.
Today, 46th Street...

600
00:58:33,253 --> 00:58:36,404
...tomorrow, Madison Square Garden.

601
00:58:41,653 --> 00:58:44,486
-Papa, what are you doing?
-Bruno!

602
00:58:44,653 --> 00:58:47,884
You've lost your mind. You're crazy.
Those tapes aren't ready.

603
00:58:48,053 --> 00:58:51,250
Look at the people.
They don't know it's not ready.

604
00:58:51,413 --> 00:58:55,292
Look at it, they like it!
Bruno, they like it! Bruno!

605
00:59:23,573 --> 00:59:26,406
-Hey, yo!
-Huh?

606
00:59:26,573 --> 00:59:30,282
Move your fucking parade!
What do you think this is, 5th Avenue?

607
00:59:30,453 --> 00:59:32,205
Back it up!

608
00:59:32,373 --> 00:59:38,243
I'll get your ass, buddy!
Who do you think you are?

609
00:59:45,013 --> 00:59:47,766
You're next, you hear me?

610
00:59:47,933 --> 00:59:50,572
Get away from there.
What are you doing?

611
00:59:50,733 --> 00:59:52,212
How do you like that?

612
00:59:52,373 --> 00:59:54,568
Pick that up, you son of a bitch!

613
01:00:29,813 --> 01:00:33,010
I thought I was just
going through a stage.

614
01:00:34,293 --> 01:00:36,443
That's what everyone told me.

615
01:00:36,613 --> 01:00:39,525
And it never
worried me when I was 10.

616
01:00:40,493 --> 01:00:45,009
Except they told me the same thing
at 12 and 14.

617
01:00:47,773 --> 01:00:52,801
So finally, my analyst
leveled with me.

618
01:00:53,053 --> 01:00:56,489
He said it was probably a life choice.

619
01:01:02,173 --> 01:01:04,050
It's funny.

620
01:01:05,893 --> 01:01:10,762
"Gay" used to mean
such a happy kind of word once.

621
01:01:12,453 --> 01:01:17,573
Not that it bothers me.
I'm pretty well-adjusted, really.

622
01:01:19,453 --> 01:01:21,409
I mean...

623
01:01:24,173 --> 01:01:26,926
...never being happy...

624
01:01:27,293 --> 01:01:30,603
...isn't the same as being unhappy.

625
01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:32,923
Is it?

626
01:01:35,253 --> 01:01:38,450
Dr. Golden explains it real well.

627
01:01:39,653 --> 01:01:41,450
He explains everything well.

628
01:01:45,453 --> 01:01:46,932
I've had a lot of help.

629
01:01:57,853 --> 01:02:01,812
Hey, Doris, you wanna go to
<i>The Rocky Horror Show</i> tomorrow night?

630
01:02:01,973 --> 01:02:03,167
That sounds great.

631
01:02:03,333 --> 01:02:07,406
It starts at midnight, so you better
check it out with your mom.

632
01:02:07,573 --> 01:02:11,248
Calling Montgomery MacNeil.

633
01:02:11,413 --> 01:02:14,371
Oh, Montgomery.

634
01:02:20,533 --> 01:02:23,570
I suppose that a fuck
is out of the question?

635
01:02:23,733 --> 01:02:26,566
There he is, Ralph Garci,
right on the button.

636
01:02:26,733 --> 01:02:28,769
-Nice.
-Get off!

637
01:02:28,933 --> 01:02:33,802
-I warned you this would happen.
-It's your case, man. I don't give a fuck.

638
01:02:33,973 --> 01:02:36,931
-It's a joke, that's all. It just came out.
-Like me.

639
01:02:37,093 --> 01:02:41,245
Yeah. Hey, Doris, listen,
I meant to tell you.

640
01:02:41,413 --> 01:02:45,486
There's an open call for a movie
at the Diplomat Hotel.

641
01:02:45,653 --> 01:02:48,884
-Oh, yeah?
-They're looking for your type.

642
01:02:49,053 --> 01:02:51,692
-What's my type?
-You know, your type.

643
01:02:51,853 --> 01:02:56,051
-Irishy, Jewishy, paranoid.
-What's the name of this movie?

644
01:02:56,213 --> 01:03:00,365
<i>-I Was a Teenage Fag Hag.</i>
-You shit!

645
01:03:03,733 --> 01:03:04,722
Stop it!

646
01:03:04,893 --> 01:03:07,612
I never knew it would
be like this, Doris.

647
01:03:07,773 --> 01:03:11,652
Oh, come closer, sweetheart.
Oh, my, such embrace.

648
01:03:16,973 --> 01:03:19,885
The Silvermans know
some very important people.

649
01:03:20,053 --> 01:03:23,728
They really have connections.
They're <i>mishpoche</i> with Soupy Sales.

650
01:03:23,893 --> 01:03:26,612
Oh, listen.
Your nice white blouse is ironed.

651
01:03:26,773 --> 01:03:30,049
Or you could wear your pink dress
with the ribbons.

652
01:03:30,213 --> 01:03:33,125
-You look so pretty in that.
-I hate that pink dress.

653
01:03:33,293 --> 01:03:36,012
-So don't wear your pink dress.
-I'm not going, Mama!

654
01:03:36,213 --> 01:03:38,090
-Then gargle.
-I'm going out to dinner!

655
01:03:38,253 --> 01:03:41,006
-It's a catered affair.
-It's not the food!

656
01:03:41,253 --> 01:03:43,483
This is an opportunity to perform.

657
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:46,531
-Take advantage of it.
-I promised Montgomery!

658
01:03:46,693 --> 01:03:49,571
Well, I promised the Silvermans!

659
01:03:52,453 --> 01:03:56,128
It's a party, Doris.
They need a singer.

660
01:03:56,293 --> 01:04:00,969
And you, you need exposure.
So you're going.

661
01:04:01,453 --> 01:04:03,364
I'm not!

662
01:04:47,773 --> 01:04:51,368
Very good, Doris.
What did you realize about yourself?

663
01:04:53,253 --> 01:04:57,246
I don't like birthday parties.
Or pink dresses.

664
01:04:58,173 --> 01:05:01,370
Or the Silvermans. Or Brooklyn.

665
01:05:01,533 --> 01:05:03,922
Or even being Jewish.

666
01:05:04,213 --> 01:05:05,805
I mean, it's not bad...

667
01:05:06,493 --> 01:05:08,882
...but it's not all I am.

668
01:05:09,053 --> 01:05:13,251
I don't know who I am,
and I never will if I don't assert myself.

669
01:05:13,413 --> 01:05:17,725
I'm 16 years old.
I've got to assert myself sometime.

670
01:05:20,053 --> 01:05:21,725
Don't I?

671
01:05:22,133 --> 01:05:24,169
Okay, Doris. Ralph?

672
01:05:26,093 --> 01:05:28,846
I was coming home from
school one day.

673
01:05:29,013 --> 01:05:30,207
As usual.

674
01:05:30,933 --> 01:05:35,688
I had a couple of pieces of business
to attend to in the neighborhood.

675
01:05:36,813 --> 01:05:38,883
It was January.

676
01:05:39,373 --> 01:05:41,682
It was snowing like crazy.

677
01:05:44,373 --> 01:05:47,410
Santa Claus just ripped
everybody off.

678
01:05:47,893 --> 01:05:50,851
He split for Toy Town or Igloo City...

679
01:05:51,013 --> 01:05:54,130
...or the North Pole
or wherever the hell he goes.

680
01:05:56,693 --> 01:05:58,729
So anyway....

681
01:05:59,893 --> 01:06:02,771
I was going home, and....

682
01:06:04,893 --> 01:06:06,884
I found this note.

683
01:06:07,293 --> 01:06:09,761
It said my two chicks were in church.

684
01:06:09,933 --> 01:06:13,164
What the hell are my two chicks
doing in church?

685
01:06:14,453 --> 01:06:16,683
Somebody die or something?

686
01:06:18,973 --> 01:06:23,603
That was.... That was a joke.
That was supposed to be a joke.

687
01:06:30,133 --> 01:06:33,523
Anyway, I went home.

688
01:06:36,293 --> 01:06:41,287
I dropped a little incense like
I always do, just to unwind a little bit.

689
01:06:43,733 --> 01:06:46,293
And I put on the TV set.

690
01:06:49,093 --> 01:06:52,130
And there was
this guy on the TV.

691
01:06:55,213 --> 01:06:57,727
And he was talking
about Freddie.

692
01:07:00,933 --> 01:07:04,687
He.... He said that....

693
01:07:06,293 --> 01:07:11,845
He said that Freddie Prinze
put a gun to his head...

694
01:07:12,013 --> 01:07:15,972
...and he killed himself.

695
01:07:19,373 --> 01:07:22,570
You know, it was an accident, man.

696
01:07:24,093 --> 01:07:27,722
Shit, I mean, he was fucking....
He was very gifted.

697
01:07:28,733 --> 01:07:33,727
You always laughed at him
because he was very fucking talented.

698
01:07:36,893 --> 01:07:40,602
And sometimes you didn't even
wanna laugh at him...

699
01:07:40,773 --> 01:07:42,764
...and you laughed at him anyway.

700
01:07:43,613 --> 01:07:45,649
But those motherfuckers...

701
01:07:45,813 --> 01:07:48,532
...they had to say that
he was depressed...

702
01:07:48,693 --> 01:07:52,129
...and he was suicidal,
and that he was fucked up.

703
01:07:52,293 --> 01:07:56,844
They wanted his fucking ass, man.
They wanted to nail his ass.

704
01:07:57,013 --> 01:08:00,972
Because he didn't think living
was such a happy trip, you know?

705
01:08:02,573 --> 01:08:05,963
We can't have happy people
walking on this planet.

706
01:08:06,133 --> 01:08:09,045
Everybody's gotta be
so goddamn serious.

707
01:08:09,213 --> 01:08:11,568
Everyone's gotta stay in business...

708
01:08:11,733 --> 01:08:16,045
...and suffer so the witch doctors
and the deodorant-spray people...

709
01:08:16,213 --> 01:08:19,330
...and plastic surgeons
could stay in business.

710
01:08:19,493 --> 01:08:23,247
And we can all go fucking pray
to the asshole God up there...

711
01:08:23,413 --> 01:08:26,325
...that fucked it up
in the first place!

712
01:08:30,773 --> 01:08:34,607
Does all this make you
realize anything about yourself?

713
01:08:34,893 --> 01:08:38,283
-What?
-How does it affect you?

714
01:08:39,373 --> 01:08:41,603
How does it affect me?

715
01:08:42,573 --> 01:08:45,326
I'm here,
and I'm in this fucking school.

716
01:08:45,493 --> 01:08:48,405
And I'm fucking everybody back
for Freddie!

717
01:08:48,573 --> 01:08:50,325
Take it easy, Ralph.

718
01:08:50,493 --> 01:08:53,690
You want them laughing
with you, not at you.

719
01:08:54,013 --> 01:08:56,004
I don't want them laughing.

720
01:09:07,893 --> 01:09:09,406
Leroy?

721
01:09:10,093 --> 01:09:11,082
Ma'am?

722
01:09:11,573 --> 01:09:13,723
What are you wearing, Leroy?

723
01:09:14,133 --> 01:09:17,011
-A hat.
-On your feet, Leroy.

724
01:09:17,173 --> 01:09:21,166
Oh, those. You like them? They get me
to class quicker, get more learning in.

725
01:09:21,333 --> 01:09:24,052
-What about your book report?
-I done it.

726
01:09:24,213 --> 01:09:27,250
-You did it.
-1000 words. I counted them too.

727
01:09:27,413 --> 01:09:30,769
<i>-The Best of Playboy</i> isn't a book report.
-It's reading, ain't it?

728
01:09:30,933 --> 01:09:35,688
So is <i>1984, Huckleberry Finn,</i>
<i>Great Expectations.</i> You heard of those?

729
01:09:35,853 --> 01:09:37,650
I seen a couple of the movies.

730
01:09:37,813 --> 01:09:40,850
If you don't read,
you're missing so much.

731
01:09:41,013 --> 01:09:46,565
-I don't like reading. It's not my style.
-Then try <i>Othello.</i> He's black.

732
01:09:46,813 --> 01:09:49,964
-1000 words in two weeks.
-Or what?

733
01:09:50,133 --> 01:09:53,762
Or you'll skate right out of
this school, Mr. Johnson.

734
01:10:09,613 --> 01:10:11,285
Come in.

735
01:10:13,173 --> 01:10:17,166
-Miss Berg, you wanted to see me?
-Come and sit down, Lisa.

736
01:10:23,253 --> 01:10:25,892
You're not working hard enough, Lisa.

737
01:10:26,373 --> 01:10:29,012
Well, I've been sick.

738
01:10:29,373 --> 01:10:31,728
Dancers don't get sick.

739
01:10:32,413 --> 01:10:34,131
Well, my doctor told me...

740
01:10:34,293 --> 01:10:37,808
...to take it easy
for a week or two until I feel okay.

741
01:10:37,973 --> 01:10:42,091
-So now it's the doctor's fault?
-Don't you believe me?

742
01:10:42,253 --> 01:10:43,686
I believe you, Lisa.

743
01:10:43,893 --> 01:10:47,602
But I don't have room
for you in this class anymore.

744
01:10:47,773 --> 01:10:50,082
But I brought a doctor's note.

745
01:10:50,253 --> 01:10:53,962
There are too many other girls
who take dance seriously...

746
01:10:54,133 --> 01:10:57,284
...to waste time and space
on someone who isn't dedicated.

747
01:10:57,453 --> 01:11:01,446
-But I am dedicated.
-I'm sorry, Lisa. I don't see it.

748
01:11:02,253 --> 01:11:04,847
I got into this school, didn't l?

749
01:11:05,013 --> 01:11:08,528
We made a mistake.
Sometimes it just doesn't work out.

750
01:11:08,693 --> 01:11:11,765
-You'll get over it.
-I'll work harder.

751
01:11:11,933 --> 01:11:14,606
-Maybe.
-I promise I'll be better.

752
01:11:14,773 --> 01:11:16,843
Better isn't good enough.

753
01:11:17,013 --> 01:11:21,131
I don't think you'll ever
be good enough. You don't have it.

754
01:11:21,293 --> 01:11:26,367
That's a hard thing to hear, and it's not
pleasant to say, but it's the truth.

755
01:11:26,533 --> 01:11:30,242
I'm saving you a lot of time and pain
by saying it now.

756
01:11:30,733 --> 01:11:33,406
I don't wanna be the best.

757
01:11:34,133 --> 01:11:37,170
-Well, you won't be.
-I just wanna dance.

758
01:11:38,453 --> 01:11:43,481
-Well, you'll never be a Mikhail, Lisa.
-I can't fail, Miss Berg.

759
01:11:43,653 --> 01:11:47,726
-I only ever wanted to be a dancer.
-You'll get over it.

760
01:11:47,893 --> 01:11:52,887
-What do I tell my mother?
-Have her call me and I'll explain.

761
01:13:18,373 --> 01:13:21,968
Fuck it. If I can't dance,
I'll change to the drama department.

762
01:13:22,453 --> 01:13:25,650
I tell you,
you're a fucking good actress.

763
01:13:32,013 --> 01:13:35,244
I heard the bitch came down
on her real hard.

764
01:13:35,413 --> 01:13:38,883
-So? Life comes down hard.
-She just took a real bad dump, kid.

765
01:13:40,853 --> 01:13:44,846
Better she realizes it now
than OD in some motel room at 30.

766
01:13:45,013 --> 01:13:47,652
You might show
a little more sympathy, dear.

767
01:13:47,973 --> 01:13:50,965
-I'm not "dear. "
<i>-Évidemment.</i>

768
01:13:51,133 --> 01:13:53,363
You're not <i>très sensitive</i> either.

769
01:13:53,653 --> 01:13:54,847
I'm a professional.

770
01:13:55,013 --> 01:13:58,562
A few unkind words aren't
going to bother me none.

771
01:13:59,053 --> 01:14:03,569
-I know it won't all be standing ovations.
-Certainly not for you, my dear.

772
01:14:04,213 --> 01:14:06,602
Look, I'm not "my dear. "
You can fuck "my dear. "

773
01:14:06,773 --> 01:14:10,846
Well, thank you. That might be fun.

774
01:14:13,613 --> 01:14:17,731
And that might be impossible.
He's not into vanilla.

775
01:14:17,893 --> 01:14:19,849
Might be a nice change
from black cherry.

776
01:14:20,013 --> 01:14:23,244
The darker the berry,
the sweeter the juice, honey.

777
01:14:23,413 --> 01:14:26,883
Yes, but who wants diabetes?

778
01:14:31,213 --> 01:14:34,603
I mean, you don't understand.
Listen to me, man.

779
01:14:34,773 --> 01:14:38,129
Diction. Watch your diction, Ralph.
You're slurring your words.

780
01:14:38,293 --> 01:14:42,923
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Marlon Brando slurred his words.

781
01:14:43,093 --> 01:14:46,244
Montgomery Clift and
James Dean slurred their words.

782
01:14:46,413 --> 01:14:50,372
They were the greatest actors in the
world. Nobody could understand them.

783
01:14:51,533 --> 01:14:53,763
Wait a second. What's so funny?

784
01:15:04,693 --> 01:15:08,447
Hey, it's Raul.
Where's my two chicks, huh?

785
01:15:15,733 --> 01:15:19,328
Look at you! You got so big!
Where is Mom? Is she home?

786
01:15:47,293 --> 01:15:49,443
Hey, cupcake. Come here, cupcake.

787
01:15:49,613 --> 01:15:53,288
Faggot.
That's what you are now, man.

788
01:15:53,653 --> 01:15:56,451
What you doing? Whoa! Damn, man.

789
01:16:39,213 --> 01:16:42,410
Martelli! Bruno Martelli!

790
01:16:45,093 --> 01:16:46,731
Shit!

791
01:16:52,213 --> 01:16:55,569
In the beginning
she's not in love with him--

792
01:16:55,733 --> 01:16:57,803
-God, you live here, Montgomery?
-Yeah.

793
01:16:57,973 --> 01:17:00,328
-This is a great pad.
-You like it?

794
01:17:00,493 --> 01:17:03,883
It's great. What happened to all
your furniture? You get ripped off?

795
01:17:04,053 --> 01:17:06,567
-It closed in Cincinnati.
-What's that mean?

796
01:17:06,733 --> 01:17:10,123
My mom kept saying she was gonna
fix it up when she got into a long run.

797
01:17:10,293 --> 01:17:12,853
-She's got a lousy choice in plays.
-It's perfect.

798
01:17:13,013 --> 01:17:17,484
We don't need nothing for rehearsal.
Ready when you are, Mr. Director.

799
01:17:17,653 --> 01:17:21,965
-All right, page one, Act 1.
-All right, page one, Act 1.

800
01:17:55,253 --> 01:17:57,448
Raul?

801
01:18:22,293 --> 01:18:24,363
Raul?

802
01:18:38,133 --> 01:18:42,604
If you're kicked around long enough,
you get to be a real professor of pain.

803
01:18:42,773 --> 01:18:46,527
I know how you feel.
But I'm having a real good time now.

804
01:18:46,693 --> 01:18:48,206
I'm enjoying myself.

805
01:18:48,373 --> 01:18:51,251
So you see, you're not such
a dog as you think you are.

806
01:18:51,413 --> 01:18:53,483
I'm having a very good time too.

807
01:18:53,653 --> 01:18:57,328
So there you are. I'm not such a dog
as I think I am.

808
01:18:57,493 --> 01:18:59,563
I think you're a very nice guy.

809
01:18:59,733 --> 01:19:03,123
I don't know why
a girl hasn't grabbed you.

810
01:19:03,293 --> 01:19:07,605
Yeah, I don't either. I am a nice guy.

811
01:19:07,853 --> 01:19:10,572
I'm also a real smart guy too.

812
01:19:18,373 --> 01:19:22,605
Wait. There's a whole speech yet.
You're not supposed to kiss yet.

813
01:19:25,253 --> 01:19:29,804
Ralph. Doris. Ralph, you have a whole
speech here you haven't even done.

814
01:19:29,973 --> 01:19:32,646
Ralph, you're not supposed to kiss yet.

815
01:19:39,573 --> 01:19:42,292
My mother was French
and very beautiful.

816
01:19:42,453 --> 01:19:47,891
Straight out of some chateau.
She danced every night for hours.

817
01:19:48,053 --> 01:19:51,887
Daddy was in Washington
or out to dinner with clients...

818
01:19:52,053 --> 01:19:55,409
...while Mom was with Tchaikovsky,
Ravel, Mantovani.

819
01:19:55,573 --> 01:19:59,122
You'll meet my stepmother, Claudia.
Trainee witch.

820
01:19:59,293 --> 01:20:02,763
No cracks about being Chinese.
She's had her eyes fixed.

821
01:20:02,933 --> 01:20:06,289
She recuperated in Palm Springs,
where she had her purse stolen.

822
01:20:06,453 --> 01:20:09,092
She lost all her credit cards.

823
01:20:09,613 --> 01:20:14,084
Dad doesn't want to report it, though.
The thief is spending less than she did.

824
01:20:21,533 --> 01:20:23,364
Hi, Daddy.

825
01:20:25,013 --> 01:20:26,332
Hi.

826
01:20:26,933 --> 01:20:29,970
Oh, this is Leroy. Homework.

827
01:23:39,813 --> 01:23:43,169
That was nice. Really.

828
01:23:43,573 --> 01:23:46,212
Sentimental shit.

829
01:23:47,093 --> 01:23:49,482
That was beautiful!

830
01:23:50,613 --> 01:23:53,650
That was beautiful.

831
01:23:54,013 --> 01:23:56,163
It was beautiful.

832
01:24:03,493 --> 01:24:06,929
-Yeah, this is it here.
-You live here?

833
01:24:07,093 --> 01:24:09,812
My sister lives here.
I'm always welcome.

834
01:24:09,973 --> 01:24:11,452
-Very nice place.
-Yeah.

835
01:24:11,613 --> 01:24:15,401
They're very fancy, huh?
I'll wait till you get inside.

836
01:24:15,573 --> 01:24:17,689
No. It's okay. Really.

837
01:24:17,853 --> 01:24:20,083
-Okay.
-It's a good neighborhood.

838
01:24:20,253 --> 01:24:24,326
-It's not much, but--
-Please, come on. That's not necessary.

839
01:24:24,493 --> 01:24:25,892
I should pay you.

840
01:24:26,053 --> 01:24:30,205
You know, I play your tapes
for my customers, you know.

841
01:24:30,373 --> 01:24:35,686
They love that stuff.
My tips go up 20%, at least.

842
01:24:36,533 --> 01:24:40,208
-And my son is happy.
-He's writing some good shit too.

843
01:24:40,373 --> 01:24:43,888
We're gonna be all over the charts
one of these days.

844
01:24:44,053 --> 01:24:48,490
-You make him happy, you know that?
-We're a hot team, you know.

845
01:24:48,653 --> 01:24:53,169
-You make him hotter. You know?
-Sure.

846
01:24:53,333 --> 01:24:58,043
I seem to have that effect on people.
What can I do? Thanks again.

847
01:24:58,213 --> 01:25:00,681
-Good night, Bruno.
-Night. Take it easy.

848
01:26:23,173 --> 01:26:24,606
You're crazy.

849
01:26:25,013 --> 01:26:26,128
You call a doctor?

850
01:26:26,453 --> 01:26:27,568
I don't think she's hurt.

851
01:26:27,853 --> 01:26:29,889
Since when are you
in the thinking business?

852
01:26:30,253 --> 01:26:31,368
She's frightened.

853
01:26:31,653 --> 01:26:34,770
-She's 5 fucking years old!
-Please keep your voice down.

854
01:26:36,693 --> 01:26:40,083
-You're in a church, my son.
-You're in the Dark Ages!

855
01:26:41,013 --> 01:26:42,685
You kiss my ass,
<i>Padre.</i>

856
01:26:43,333 --> 01:26:47,849
She needs a doctor! A doctor!
Not the goddamn Holy Ghost!

857
01:27:11,613 --> 01:27:13,604
Is she all right?

858
01:27:17,613 --> 01:27:20,366
You're not attacked by a creep
at 5 years old and all right.

859
01:27:20,813 --> 01:27:22,405
I'm sorry.

860
01:27:22,693 --> 01:27:25,332
Doris, I wasn't there!
I wasn't fucking there!

861
01:27:25,773 --> 01:27:26,888
What about your father?

862
01:27:27,413 --> 01:27:29,643
I happen to be between
fathers right now.

863
01:27:29,813 --> 01:27:31,087
What does that mean?

864
01:27:31,733 --> 01:27:33,724
You got to understand something.

865
01:27:34,293 --> 01:27:37,126
You got to understand
the Puerto Rican woman.

866
01:27:38,853 --> 01:27:40,525
She thinks about
the kids...

867
01:27:40,693 --> 01:27:44,652
...how they gotta have a father.
Love has nothing to do with it.

868
01:27:45,493 --> 01:27:47,643
My mom has an extra room.
She rents it out.

869
01:27:47,813 --> 01:27:50,611
Next thing you know,
I've got a new father.

870
01:27:56,213 --> 01:27:59,523
They're all right, mostly.
They may stay a day...

871
01:27:59,973 --> 01:28:02,806
...or a week or a month,
if we're lucky.

872
01:28:03,453 --> 01:28:05,648
Sometimes they even pay the rent.

873
01:28:07,733 --> 01:28:09,485
They keep out all the rats.

874
01:28:10,333 --> 01:28:13,211
Not animal-type rats.
I'm talking about real rats...

875
01:28:13,373 --> 01:28:15,011
...the junkies and the winos...

876
01:28:15,173 --> 01:28:18,563
...and the shitheads
and the people who beat up...

877
01:28:22,253 --> 01:28:24,721
...little 5-year-old kids.

878
01:28:28,293 --> 01:28:30,249
I got three sisters, see?

879
01:28:31,933 --> 01:28:35,846
One of them, Maria, she's
in kind of a special place.

880
01:28:37,093 --> 01:28:40,972
We see her a couple times a year.
She's got a birth defect.

881
01:28:43,973 --> 01:28:46,646
That's a goddamn lie.

882
01:28:48,293 --> 01:28:50,853
That's a goddamn lie!

883
01:28:52,453 --> 01:28:55,092
Want to know about my father?
My first fucking father?

884
01:28:55,253 --> 01:28:57,323
He ain't no special shit.

885
01:28:58,613 --> 01:29:01,969
He's in New York State Penitentiary.
He's doing time.

886
01:29:03,213 --> 01:29:06,125
I remember this one night
he got bothered...

887
01:29:06,293 --> 01:29:09,649
...because I was making her laugh.
I was telling her stories.

888
01:29:10,093 --> 01:29:13,483
It was just kid stuff.
Flying carpets and dragons.

889
01:29:13,653 --> 01:29:16,611
And he got mad
because she was laughing!

890
01:29:17,173 --> 01:29:19,641
And he said I was telling her lies.

891
01:29:19,933 --> 01:29:21,446
And this one night...

892
01:29:22,693 --> 01:29:24,331
...he got bothered.

893
01:29:25,493 --> 01:29:27,802
He's beating me
and coming down on me...

894
01:29:27,973 --> 01:29:29,406
...I said, "I make her laugh."

895
01:29:29,573 --> 01:29:32,610
That's not a lie, that's a gift,
goddamn it.

896
01:29:33,813 --> 01:29:35,849
He can't do it.

897
01:29:37,013 --> 01:29:41,131
He said if he can't do it,
he sure as shit's gonna stop it.

898
01:29:42,693 --> 01:29:45,002
And he went for me, and...

899
01:29:45,853 --> 01:29:48,686
...she got in the way
all of a sudden, and...

900
01:29:50,213 --> 01:29:52,807
...he put her head inside a fucking wall.

901
01:29:53,653 --> 01:29:56,804
If it was my fucking head,
it would've been all right...

902
01:29:56,973 --> 01:29:59,089
...but it wasn't. It was hers!

903
01:29:59,413 --> 01:30:03,406
If it was my fucking fat head,
it would've been all right.

904
01:30:05,013 --> 01:30:08,210
She's a beautiful kid.
She's 5 fucking years old.

905
01:30:08,453 --> 01:30:13,322
She's got a pretty little laugh.
She still laughs, as a matter of fact.

906
01:31:12,653 --> 01:31:14,723
Barbra Streisand didn't
change her name.

907
01:31:14,933 --> 01:31:18,448
-I don't want to talk about it.
-I'll call you Doris, like always.

908
01:31:18,613 --> 01:31:19,728
I won't answer.

909
01:31:19,893 --> 01:31:23,568
-It's a perfectly good name.
-For a perfectly good person.

910
01:31:23,733 --> 01:31:27,043
A skinny, boring, nondescript,
perfectly good person.

911
01:31:27,373 --> 01:31:32,527
I have a lot of friends named Doris,
and they are none of those things.

912
01:31:32,773 --> 01:31:34,843
-Yeah, but they're all--
-What?

913
01:31:35,093 --> 01:31:37,163
No, no, no. Say it. Go ahead. Say it!

914
01:31:37,333 --> 01:31:41,565
I would like to know what my daughter
thinks is wrong with my friends.

915
01:31:41,733 --> 01:31:45,123
I don't want a middle-aged name.
I can't relate to it.

916
01:31:45,413 --> 01:31:46,846
You can call me Dominique.

917
01:31:47,013 --> 01:31:48,128
Dominique.

918
01:31:48,293 --> 01:31:50,523
-That's ridiculous.
-It's French.

919
01:31:50,693 --> 01:31:54,971
-I know what it is, but it's not you.
-I'll grow into it.

920
01:31:55,253 --> 01:31:58,563
-Dominique Finsecker?
-No. Dominique Dupont.

921
01:31:59,133 --> 01:32:01,169
-Sounds like a hooker.
-Oh, Mama.

922
01:32:01,333 --> 01:32:05,087
I don't know what's happening to you.
Tell me what's happening to you.

923
01:32:05,493 --> 01:32:07,563
Where did my Doris go?

924
01:32:07,893 --> 01:32:11,727
Something wonderful is happening
to me, Mama. I'm growing up.

925
01:32:12,893 --> 01:32:15,009
You're becoming somebody else.

926
01:32:15,293 --> 01:32:19,525
-I'm becoming an actress.
-I want you to be the Doris that I know.

927
01:32:19,693 --> 01:32:22,526
That I love. That helps
me with the groceries.

928
01:32:23,453 --> 01:32:25,409
Makes me birthday cards...

929
01:32:25,573 --> 01:32:27,882
...out of Cheerio packets, huh?

930
01:32:28,493 --> 01:32:29,892
Not Dominique...

931
01:32:30,213 --> 01:32:32,169
...who stays out all night.

932
01:32:32,333 --> 01:32:33,652
Oh, Mama.

933
01:32:33,853 --> 01:32:35,571
And gets pregnant.

934
01:32:36,053 --> 01:32:38,328
Or has an abortion, God forbid.

935
01:32:40,053 --> 01:32:43,125
Now, Dominique, she'd be smart.

936
01:32:44,013 --> 01:32:45,651
But my Doris...

937
01:32:46,173 --> 01:32:48,129
...she's dumb enough
to get knocked up--

938
01:32:48,493 --> 01:32:50,688
Mama, it was just one night!

939
01:32:52,533 --> 01:32:54,091
That's all it takes.

940
01:33:05,053 --> 01:33:08,284
We'd like to welcome everyone to
<i>The Rocky Horror Picture Show...</i>

941
01:33:08,453 --> 01:33:10,762
...here at the 8th Street Playhouse!

942
01:33:15,733 --> 01:33:18,611
And our regulars would
like to wish a warm welcome...

943
01:33:18,773 --> 01:33:21,162
...to all you virgins!

944
01:33:24,733 --> 01:33:27,372
We have some special occasions tonight.

945
01:33:27,733 --> 01:33:30,201
Tonight is Gail's birthday.

946
01:33:34,293 --> 01:33:38,127
We have a special button
for a special young lady.

947
01:33:38,293 --> 01:33:42,332
Tonight is Christine's 150th time!

948
01:33:52,813 --> 01:33:54,769
Let's hear it for her! Come on!

949
01:34:01,173 --> 01:34:04,131
Now, we have a special warning
from the management.

950
01:34:04,293 --> 01:34:07,205
No lit candles. No throwing
food at the screen. Understand?

951
01:34:07,453 --> 01:34:08,681
Get on with the show!

952
01:34:09,213 --> 01:34:11,727
This is the fucking show!
If you don't like it...

953
01:34:11,893 --> 01:34:14,123
...you can go see the movie
in Staten Island!

954
01:34:14,293 --> 01:34:17,330
Boy, is he in for a surprise tonight.

955
01:34:17,693 --> 01:34:19,285
All right, for the cheers!

956
01:34:19,453 --> 01:34:21,125
-Give me an R!
-R!

957
01:34:21,373 --> 01:34:22,852
-Give me an O!
-O!

958
01:34:23,053 --> 01:34:24,372
-Give me a C!
-C!

959
01:34:24,533 --> 01:34:26,330
-Give me a K!
-K!

960
01:34:26,493 --> 01:34:27,812
-Give me a Y!
-Y!

961
01:34:28,053 --> 01:34:29,611
-What's it spell?
-Rocky!

962
01:34:29,773 --> 01:34:31,889
-I can't hear you!
-Rocky!

963
01:34:32,133 --> 01:34:34,124
-One more time!
-Rocky!

964
01:34:34,293 --> 01:34:35,362
-Give me an E!
-E!

965
01:34:35,533 --> 01:34:37,012
-Give me an A!
-A!

966
01:34:37,173 --> 01:34:39,812
-What kind of time we gonna have?
-E-A!

967
01:36:47,173 --> 01:36:49,323
<i>Where did that</i>
<i>motorcyclist come from?</i>

968
01:36:49,493 --> 01:36:51,165
<i>I guess we'll have to turn back.</i>

969
01:36:57,453 --> 01:37:00,206
<i>-What was that bang?</i>
<i>-Must have a blowout.</i>

970
01:37:00,773 --> 01:37:02,047
<i>Damn it!</i>

971
01:37:02,213 --> 01:37:06,126
<i>-I should have gotten that spare fixed.</i>
-Asshole!

972
01:37:06,293 --> 01:37:08,443
<i>Stay here and keep warm.</i>
<i>I'll go for help.</i>

973
01:37:08,613 --> 01:37:10,922
<i>Where will you go</i>
<i>in the middle of nowhere?</i>

974
01:37:11,093 --> 01:37:14,449
What's white and sells hamburgers?

975
01:37:14,613 --> 01:37:17,491
<i>Didn 't we pass a castle down the road?</i>

976
01:37:17,773 --> 01:37:19,764
<i>Maybe they have a telephone.</i>

977
01:37:19,933 --> 01:37:21,491
<i>I'm going with you.</i>

978
01:37:25,813 --> 01:37:27,963
Kick it!

979
01:37:31,893 --> 01:37:36,523
Hey, Janet! How about fries
to go with that shake?

980
01:37:40,573 --> 01:37:43,007
Take the risk!

981
01:37:49,653 --> 01:37:53,168
Hey, Riff, show us your mother!

982
01:38:10,453 --> 01:38:12,171
Watch the film.

983
01:38:42,093 --> 01:38:44,243
How's it go?

984
01:39:00,253 --> 01:39:02,323
Oh, my God.

985
01:39:11,653 --> 01:39:13,564
-You did what?
-I got stoned.

986
01:39:14,253 --> 01:39:16,528
She took her top off.
She played with her bongos.

987
01:39:16,973 --> 01:39:18,929
-I did not!
-It was incredible!

988
01:39:19,093 --> 01:39:21,049
It was more than incredible, it was fun.

989
01:39:21,213 --> 01:39:24,808
I felt naked when people looked at me
before. But they weren't looking at me...

990
01:39:24,973 --> 01:39:27,965
...they were looking at someone
I put on. Like a costume.

991
01:39:28,333 --> 01:39:32,690
If I don't have a personality, so what?
I'm an actress.

992
01:39:32,893 --> 01:39:35,407
I can put on
as many personalities as I want.

993
01:39:35,573 --> 01:39:38,212
-To schizophrenia!
-Abso-fucking-lutely!

994
01:39:38,573 --> 01:39:42,168
-Abso-fucking-what?
-You kids ready to order now?

995
01:39:42,773 --> 01:39:44,491
-Michael?
-Yeah.

996
01:39:45,013 --> 01:39:46,651
You don't remember?

997
01:39:47,253 --> 01:39:49,323
Two years ago. I'm Doris Fin--

998
01:39:49,493 --> 01:39:53,008
I was Doris Finsecker, when
you were a senior at P.A.

999
01:39:53,533 --> 01:39:57,367
-Yeah. Around the corner.
-You remember Montgomery MacNeil...

1000
01:39:57,533 --> 01:39:59,728
-...and Ralph Garci.
-Sure. Good old days.

1001
01:40:00,293 --> 01:40:01,282
How was Hollywood?

1002
01:40:01,733 --> 01:40:02,848
Slow.

1003
01:40:03,093 --> 01:40:05,812
I met some people,
went to some parties.

1004
01:40:06,213 --> 01:40:09,489
-I did a pilot for a series.
-I didn't see it.

1005
01:40:09,693 --> 01:40:11,092
Nobody saw it.

1006
01:40:11,453 --> 01:40:12,522
Sorry.

1007
01:40:13,173 --> 01:40:16,370
-I did a couple of days as a male nurse.
-Did you?

1008
01:40:16,693 --> 01:40:18,490
On a soap.

1009
01:40:19,413 --> 01:40:21,973
-I didn't like L.A. too much.
-It sucks out there.

1010
01:40:22,333 --> 01:40:25,723
-Are you studying?
-I catch a class when I can.

1011
01:40:25,893 --> 01:40:27,531
Hard times, you know?

1012
01:40:28,373 --> 01:40:30,807
-I read for a showcase.
-Oh, really?

1013
01:40:30,973 --> 01:40:32,850
I got a callback next week.

1014
01:40:33,173 --> 01:40:34,925
-Hope you get it.
-Hey, good luck.

1015
01:40:35,293 --> 01:40:36,328
Yeah.

1016
01:40:36,893 --> 01:40:37,962
Yeah.

1017
01:40:39,733 --> 01:40:41,052
What you kids having?

1018
01:40:41,333 --> 01:40:43,528
Got a special today on fried clams.

1019
01:40:43,813 --> 01:40:46,930
-Fried clams sound great.
-Yeah, that's fine.

1020
01:40:47,813 --> 01:40:51,488
-Fried clams is great.
-Yeah, sounds good.

1021
01:40:55,573 --> 01:40:57,564
Welcome to Catch a Rising Star.

1022
01:40:58,853 --> 01:41:01,162
Did anybody know it was Monday night?

1023
01:41:01,453 --> 01:41:05,048
Monday night is audition night.
Anybody from anywhere...

1024
01:41:05,213 --> 01:41:07,283
...can come up here and do
what they want.

1025
01:41:07,453 --> 01:41:09,887
You should see what walks in the room.

1026
01:41:10,053 --> 01:41:13,170
Some of the people that started here
were David Brenner...

1027
01:41:13,333 --> 01:41:14,482
...Jimmie Walker...

1028
01:41:14,693 --> 01:41:18,971
...Gabe Kaplan, Freddie Prinze.
Maybe this next young man might...

1029
01:41:19,373 --> 01:41:21,011
...watch them on television.

1030
01:41:21,653 --> 01:41:25,043
Please welcome the comedy stylings...

1031
01:41:25,293 --> 01:41:28,171
...of Ralph Garci, ladies and gentlemen.

1032
01:41:32,813 --> 01:41:34,883
Yay, Ralph!

1033
01:41:35,693 --> 01:41:36,682
Thank you.

1034
01:41:37,413 --> 01:41:40,211
Like Richard said,
my name is Ralph Garci.

1035
01:41:40,373 --> 01:41:42,170
I'm a professional asshole.

1036
01:41:45,373 --> 01:41:48,683
I see we have a few
amateurs in the audience.

1037
01:41:50,293 --> 01:41:51,362
I have some--

1038
01:41:51,533 --> 01:41:56,049
Some. I have all of my friends here
tonight. From P.A. graduating class.

1039
01:42:00,333 --> 01:42:02,722
It's very important to have friends.

1040
01:42:03,493 --> 01:42:05,165
I live in the South Bronx.

1041
01:42:06,853 --> 01:42:10,289
That's the country just north of Harlem
and west of Puerto Rico.

1042
01:42:10,453 --> 01:42:12,489
It's a very tough neighborhood.

1043
01:42:12,653 --> 01:42:14,245
The dogs carry knives.

1044
01:42:16,213 --> 01:42:18,932
Did you ever see a baby
with a zip gun?

1045
01:42:19,613 --> 01:42:23,891
You gotta have friends. You can't
alienate anybody up there. Nobody.

1046
01:42:24,053 --> 01:42:27,568
Black people, white people, Chicanos,
Puerto Ricans, cockroaches.

1047
01:42:28,133 --> 01:42:30,852
You gotta respect cockroaches.
They got a good union.

1048
01:42:31,213 --> 01:42:35,411
Last week, 15,000 marched down my
block demanding better housing.

1049
01:42:37,493 --> 01:42:41,168
But I love the South Bronx.
Everywhere you go from there is up.

1050
01:42:42,173 --> 01:42:46,803
Everybody has dreams in the
South Bronx. I had dreams.

1051
01:42:47,173 --> 01:42:50,529
Stop your average boy
on a South Bronx street...

1052
01:42:51,293 --> 01:42:53,602
...and ask him
what he wants to be.

1053
01:42:53,973 --> 01:42:56,965
"I want to be an ex-junkie, man."

1054
01:42:58,013 --> 01:42:59,810
You can see them every day.

1055
01:42:59,973 --> 01:43:04,125
You can't drive because of the dreams
on the streets being seen by cokeheads.

1056
01:43:04,293 --> 01:43:09,128
The minute that white line's laid down
the street, you got somebody going:

1057
01:43:10,293 --> 01:43:11,362
It's true.

1058
01:43:12,853 --> 01:43:15,413
And then there is sex.

1059
01:43:16,533 --> 01:43:17,886
Oh, yeah.

1060
01:43:18,253 --> 01:43:20,847
Kids are into sex earlier in South Bronx.

1061
01:43:21,813 --> 01:43:23,405
Like about 6 a.m.

1062
01:43:27,653 --> 01:43:29,211
-You were wonderful.
-No.

1063
01:43:29,373 --> 01:43:32,206
-Really.
-I was good. I felt more than good.

1064
01:43:32,373 --> 01:43:34,364
-The guy wants me back.
-You're kidding!

1065
01:43:34,533 --> 01:43:36,171
He wants to book me regularly.

1066
01:43:36,333 --> 01:43:37,686
-Great!
-That's not great...

1067
01:43:37,853 --> 01:43:39,923
...it's fantastic! It's like electricity.

1068
01:43:40,093 --> 01:43:43,529
You're out there. Those faces are
out there, staring at you...

1069
01:43:43,693 --> 01:43:46,969
...and you draw them in, then
you hit them with the juice.

1070
01:43:47,133 --> 01:43:51,172
And bam! They fucking explode!
And that power goes back and forth.

1071
01:43:51,333 --> 01:43:53,722
Next thing you know,
you're making them laugh.

1072
01:43:53,893 --> 01:43:57,363
That is the meanest high there is.
That beats dope. That beats sex.

1073
01:43:57,773 --> 01:44:00,890
I love fucking acting!

1074
01:44:01,093 --> 01:44:04,449
With my money, we can get
a place. We can get married maybe.

1075
01:44:04,613 --> 01:44:08,686
I'll have $20,000 a week, a hit
TV series, my face on <i>TV Guide</i>!

1076
01:44:08,853 --> 01:44:09,922
-Wait!
-What?

1077
01:44:10,093 --> 01:44:13,688
-What about me? Don't I get a career?
-A career? I'll give you a career.

1078
01:44:13,893 --> 01:44:18,842
How about Shakespeare in the Park
and you get to win 17 Tony awards?

1079
01:44:19,093 --> 01:44:21,891
-All right. Bye.
-All right. Okay. Bye.

1080
01:44:23,573 --> 01:44:25,165
Don't mug anybody.

1081
01:44:25,613 --> 01:44:28,525
-Don't rape anybody.
-I'll rape you.

1082
01:44:28,693 --> 01:44:30,012
Don't rape anybody, okay?

1083
01:44:30,173 --> 01:44:31,731
I'll see you later. Take care.

1084
01:44:36,693 --> 01:44:37,887
You see...

1085
01:44:39,053 --> 01:44:42,284
...I've been offered this place
with the San Francisco Ballet.

1086
01:44:42,453 --> 01:44:45,411
I haven't told anyone yet,
but I'm gonna take it.

1087
01:44:45,573 --> 01:44:47,609
I don't care what they think.

1088
01:44:48,173 --> 01:44:50,482
I'm a good dancer. Better than good.

1089
01:44:50,733 --> 01:44:53,088
Maybe even the best in the school.

1090
01:44:53,933 --> 01:44:57,209
That's not conceit.
It's just simple honesty.

1091
01:44:58,333 --> 01:45:02,690
If I stay in New York, everybody will
think I bought my way into ABT.

1092
01:45:02,973 --> 01:45:07,888
I'm not starving myself to death
for Balanchine's City Ballet.

1093
01:45:09,013 --> 01:45:12,289
Not that I mind doing
the corps de ballet bullshit.

1094
01:45:12,853 --> 01:45:15,242
I'd sooner do it out of town.

1095
01:45:16,813 --> 01:45:19,281
I'll pay my dues on the West Coast.

1096
01:45:20,093 --> 01:45:22,766
Come back to New York as a star.

1097
01:45:25,453 --> 01:45:26,602
You see...

1098
01:45:27,413 --> 01:45:29,881
...I've always had this crazy dream...

1099
01:45:30,053 --> 01:45:33,648
...of dancing all the classical
roles before I'm 21.

1100
01:45:35,253 --> 01:45:39,087
I want <i>Giselles</i> and <i>Coppélias</i>
coming out of my feet.

1101
01:45:39,613 --> 01:45:41,569
And <i>Sleeping Beauties</i>...

1102
01:45:42,013 --> 01:45:43,924
...and the <i>Swan</i>.

1103
01:45:45,493 --> 01:45:48,405
I want bravos in Stuttgart
and Leningrad...

1104
01:45:48,573 --> 01:45:50,086
...and Paris.

1105
01:45:51,293 --> 01:45:54,603
Maybe even a ballet
created especially for me.

1106
01:45:57,813 --> 01:45:59,246
You see...

1107
01:45:59,893 --> 01:46:02,612
...there's no room for a baby.

1108
01:46:03,533 --> 01:46:06,923
Will this be Master Charge
or American Express, honey?

1109
01:46:15,373 --> 01:46:16,601
Excuse me.

1110
01:46:17,813 --> 01:46:19,485
You're an actress, aren't you?

1111
01:46:19,853 --> 01:46:21,172
I might be.

1112
01:46:21,973 --> 01:46:23,725
<i>A Chorus Line,</i>
right?

1113
01:46:24,133 --> 01:46:27,682
Aren't you the one that does that
hot, smoky number in the red dress?

1114
01:46:28,213 --> 01:46:30,886
I'm right, ain't I? I knew it.

1115
01:46:31,413 --> 01:46:35,167
Boy, let me tell you, you are
the best thing in that show.

1116
01:46:36,733 --> 01:46:40,328
I guess you get tired of hearing that.
Excuse me.

1117
01:46:40,493 --> 01:46:41,972
No, I don't.

1118
01:46:43,413 --> 01:46:45,131
You don't belong there.

1119
01:46:45,453 --> 01:46:47,728
If you don't mind my
saying so, you're a star.

1120
01:46:47,893 --> 01:46:49,611
You need a show all to yourself.

1121
01:46:49,813 --> 01:46:53,965
-You've got a lovely face, a great figure.
-I sing too.

1122
01:46:54,133 --> 01:46:55,566
-No.
-And play the piano.

1123
01:46:55,853 --> 01:46:58,492
That's what I mean. But it's
more than just talent...

1124
01:46:58,653 --> 01:47:00,644
...it's a certain quality.

1125
01:47:00,853 --> 01:47:03,686
You're the kind of girl that
stands out in a room.

1126
01:47:03,893 --> 01:47:06,805
This might sound a little
presumptuous of me....

1127
01:47:07,613 --> 01:47:09,604
I should probably
just call your agent.

1128
01:47:10,213 --> 01:47:14,331
-I don't really relate to agents.
-Don't blame you at all.

1129
01:47:14,573 --> 01:47:17,804
Listen, my name is François.
Francois Lafete.

1130
01:47:18,173 --> 01:47:19,162
Coco.

1131
01:47:19,533 --> 01:47:22,650
Coco? Coco? That's terrific!

1132
01:47:22,933 --> 01:47:26,846
Listen, Coco, I'm doing this picture
down in the south of France, you know?

1133
01:47:27,533 --> 01:47:29,967
I was wondering if...

1134
01:47:30,773 --> 01:47:33,241
...maybe you'd like to do
a screen test for me.

1135
01:47:36,973 --> 01:47:38,372
Are you serious?

1136
01:47:44,693 --> 01:47:46,126
Bunsky.

1137
01:47:46,573 --> 01:47:47,926
Hey, Bunsky.

1138
01:47:48,973 --> 01:47:50,008
You seen Sherwood?

1139
01:47:50,213 --> 01:47:52,249
She's with her husband.

1140
01:47:52,413 --> 01:47:55,007
-I didn't know she had a husband.
-He's sick, Leroy.

1141
01:47:55,373 --> 01:47:57,091
He'd have to be to be her husband.

1142
01:47:57,253 --> 01:47:59,847
He's quite bad.
In the hospital, anyway.

1143
01:48:00,013 --> 01:48:01,810
-Hospital?
-Apparently.

1144
01:48:02,333 --> 01:48:03,925
Okay, Schlepstein.

1145
01:48:30,573 --> 01:48:32,609
Leroy. What are you doing here?

1146
01:48:35,813 --> 01:48:37,485
You ever heard of Alvin Ailey?

1147
01:48:37,693 --> 01:48:38,921
Alvin Ailey?

1148
01:48:39,413 --> 01:48:40,482
He's a....

1149
01:48:41,093 --> 01:48:42,526
He's a choreographer?

1150
01:48:43,653 --> 01:48:45,484
He wants me to join his company.

1151
01:48:45,653 --> 01:48:49,009
I'm sorry, Leroy, but I don't think
this is the time--

1152
01:48:49,173 --> 01:48:51,812
I can't if you flunk me out.
I have to pass.

1153
01:48:52,053 --> 01:48:54,203
You should've thought of it
four years ago.

1154
01:48:54,373 --> 01:48:56,682
Where I come from
it don't pay to read and speak white.

1155
01:48:56,853 --> 01:48:58,650
Don't lecture me, Leroy.

1156
01:48:59,213 --> 01:49:02,967
Maybe I didn't say it right, but you
been down hard on me since day one.

1157
01:49:03,133 --> 01:49:05,283
Whatever you say,
Leroy. Go home.

1158
01:49:05,453 --> 01:49:08,525
I stopped going home!
You never knew that, did you?

1159
01:49:08,693 --> 01:49:12,891
You make a big deal about pulling us out
of the gutter, yet you won't eat with us.

1160
01:49:13,053 --> 01:49:15,613
You know where that leaves people
like me? Nowhere!

1161
01:49:15,773 --> 01:49:19,766
-It isn't the time. I don't wanna hear it.
-You're going to hear it!

1162
01:49:19,933 --> 01:49:23,687
-I'm gonna be a good dancer!
-Just get out of here, please!

1163
01:49:23,933 --> 01:49:26,845
-You will not keep me down...
-Leave me alone!

1164
01:49:27,013 --> 01:49:31,882
-...because I can't read stories!
-Don't you think of anyone but yourself?

1165
01:49:51,093 --> 01:49:52,082
Hey.

1166
01:49:52,733 --> 01:49:54,564
How's your old man doing?

1167
01:49:55,173 --> 01:49:56,162
Shit.

1168
01:50:00,573 --> 01:50:01,562
Here.

1169
01:50:03,413 --> 01:50:04,926
Thank you.

1170
01:51:04,773 --> 01:51:08,971
Coco. <i>Bonjour</i>. You made it.
Come on in.

1171
01:51:12,173 --> 01:51:15,085
-Am I early?
-Don't be silly. Let me take your coat.

1172
01:51:15,573 --> 01:51:17,643
-Where's the crew?
-You're looking at him.

1173
01:51:17,853 --> 01:51:20,890
I must have total control of
the creative product.

1174
01:51:21,053 --> 01:51:22,406
Like Godard.

1175
01:51:23,213 --> 01:51:26,285
-Jean-Luc Godard? Ever hear of that guy?
-French?

1176
01:51:28,733 --> 01:51:31,042
-You ever see any of his pictures?
-Sure.

1177
01:51:31,213 --> 01:51:33,124
Then you know what I'm talking about.

1178
01:51:34,133 --> 01:51:38,411
You see, I belong, sort of, to the
auteur school of filmmaking.

1179
01:51:38,573 --> 01:51:40,052
It's like the--

1180
01:51:40,213 --> 01:51:43,444
It's like the Mediterranean
approach, you know what I mean?

1181
01:51:44,733 --> 01:51:47,042
-Do you want a beer?
-No, thanks. I'm okay.

1182
01:51:47,213 --> 01:51:50,728
-It might relax you.
-It's all right. I have a lot on my mind.

1183
01:51:50,893 --> 01:51:52,167
I understand.

1184
01:51:54,013 --> 01:51:55,765
-What?
-Come here.

1185
01:51:57,093 --> 01:52:00,324
That's it. I want you to sit right here.

1186
01:52:00,493 --> 01:52:05,248
We're gonna do a lovely close-up
of that beautiful face.

1187
01:52:06,213 --> 01:52:09,444
I get nervous at first with cold readings,
but then I'm all right.

1188
01:52:09,613 --> 01:52:12,650
Don't worry about that.
We'll get to the dialogue later.

1189
01:52:13,413 --> 01:52:17,929
-So, you like art movies, huh, Coco?
-Antonioni and those people? Sure.

1190
01:52:18,093 --> 01:52:20,402
It beats watching
<i>Laverne & Shirley.</i>

1191
01:52:20,573 --> 01:52:23,724
Coco, you don't know
what you're doing to my lens.

1192
01:52:26,093 --> 01:52:28,288
You have a natural rapport
with the camera.

1193
01:52:28,453 --> 01:52:31,604
It's unbelievable. Some performers
can make love to the camera.

1194
01:52:31,773 --> 01:52:33,126
Garbo did.

1195
01:52:33,533 --> 01:52:35,046
Monroe did.

1196
01:52:36,373 --> 01:52:37,522
So could you.

1197
01:52:37,893 --> 01:52:39,849
-Yeah?
-Oh, yeah.

1198
01:52:40,253 --> 01:52:42,323
Could you take your top off, please?

1199
01:52:45,933 --> 01:52:48,925
-What?
-Could you take your blouse off?

1200
01:52:50,693 --> 01:52:52,888
-Are you kidding?
-No, I'm not kidding.

1201
01:52:53,973 --> 01:52:56,771
What's the matter?
You're acting like some dumb kid.

1202
01:52:56,933 --> 01:52:59,242
-I thought you were a professional.
-I am.

1203
01:52:59,413 --> 01:53:01,290
Well, then what's the problem?

1204
01:53:13,293 --> 01:53:15,011
I can't.

1205
01:53:24,693 --> 01:53:25,921
That's better.

1206
01:53:27,413 --> 01:53:28,812
That's lovely.

1207
01:53:30,573 --> 01:53:32,165
Oh, yeah.

1208
01:53:33,933 --> 01:53:37,846
Yeah. Could you arch your back?
Arch your back a little, Coco.

1209
01:53:41,293 --> 01:53:43,409
Smile for me, Coco.

1210
01:53:43,733 --> 01:53:48,443
Come on, Coco. Smile, smile.
Smile for me.

1211
01:53:49,573 --> 01:53:51,291
Now take your thumb...

1212
01:53:51,453 --> 01:53:53,091
...and put it in your mouth...

1213
01:53:53,253 --> 01:53:55,687
...like a little schoolgirl.

1214
01:53:58,173 --> 01:54:00,323
You ever notice that
black news reporters...

1215
01:54:00,493 --> 01:54:03,212
...get hired because
they have white accents?

1216
01:54:03,373 --> 01:54:06,604
They should hire a more natural guy,
a dude from the street.

1217
01:54:07,013 --> 01:54:08,526
"This is Rufus X with the news...."

1218
01:54:10,853 --> 01:54:12,332
I need something.

1219
01:54:12,493 --> 01:54:13,767
Sleep.

1220
01:54:14,453 --> 01:54:16,921
-Something to keep me flying.
-Like what?

1221
01:54:17,333 --> 01:54:20,006
Like by way of your witch doctor.

1222
01:54:20,293 --> 01:54:22,568
I don't see Dr. Golden anymore.
You know that.

1223
01:54:23,053 --> 01:54:24,850
Anyway, you've been taking too much.

1224
01:54:25,013 --> 01:54:27,686
-Thanks, Marcus Welby.
-I know what I'm talking about.

1225
01:54:27,853 --> 01:54:30,128
Why don't you get off my fucking case?

1226
01:54:30,293 --> 01:54:32,966
-I'm your friend.
-You're my friend? Really?

1227
01:54:33,133 --> 01:54:36,648
I know what you've been
after, you goddamn faggot.

1228
01:54:40,653 --> 01:54:42,450
I gotta go to the bathroom.

1229
01:54:44,173 --> 01:54:45,811
Good. You do that.

1230
01:54:47,693 --> 01:54:49,172
Hi. You got a problem?

1231
01:54:49,773 --> 01:54:51,047
Yeah, I do.

1232
01:54:51,493 --> 01:54:53,245
We never see you anymore.

1233
01:54:53,493 --> 01:54:54,892
You see me plenty.

1234
01:54:55,053 --> 01:54:57,442
Drinking with your new friends
after the show.

1235
01:54:57,613 --> 01:55:00,730
After the show is when
all the big names come in.

1236
01:55:00,893 --> 01:55:03,009
You meet people. That's what counts.

1237
01:55:03,173 --> 01:55:05,926
I hate drinking. I'm doing this
for my future. For our future.

1238
01:55:06,093 --> 01:55:09,210
You're doing this for some image,
for Freddie because he did it.

1239
01:55:09,373 --> 01:55:11,682
-Yeah? Maybe.
-Yeah? Well, he died doing it.

1240
01:55:11,973 --> 01:55:14,043
-He could have been a real actor.
-He was!

1241
01:55:14,213 --> 01:55:17,808
He was funny and charming
and he made people laugh. That's it.

1242
01:55:17,973 --> 01:55:21,283
-That's plenty!
-That's not enough! Not for you!

1243
01:55:21,453 --> 01:55:23,205
-Jesus Christ!
-You are good, Ralph.

1244
01:55:23,373 --> 01:55:25,762
-You're seriously really good.
-Jesus.

1245
01:55:25,933 --> 01:55:30,563
You're full of rage and pain and love.
Not just jokes. You're an original.

1246
01:55:30,733 --> 01:55:32,564
The original Ralph Garci.

1247
01:55:32,813 --> 01:55:36,328
-You don't have to be somebody else.
-You're bringing me down!

1248
01:55:36,493 --> 01:55:39,007
-You're bringing me fucking down!
-I'm sorry!

1249
01:55:39,173 --> 01:55:43,052
I gotta go make people laugh, and
you're talking about rage and pain.

1250
01:55:43,213 --> 01:55:45,647
-I said I'm sorry!
-It takes fucking wings.

1251
01:55:45,813 --> 01:55:48,964
Miss Seriously, let me tear flypaper, huh?

1252
01:55:49,453 --> 01:55:51,330
Give me a fucking break, honey!

1253
01:55:51,493 --> 01:55:55,008
Give me a fucking break.
Okay, pal? Thank you.

1254
01:55:57,893 --> 01:56:01,602
-What's happening to you?
-What's happening to me? Success.

1255
01:56:01,773 --> 01:56:05,652
Now, you either hang on or hang up.
All right?

1256
01:56:11,053 --> 01:56:14,682
It's a great pleasure to introduce
a young man who's funny and loud.

1257
01:56:14,853 --> 01:56:16,127
Especially during my act.

1258
01:56:16,293 --> 01:56:20,081
Please welcome the comedy stylings
of Ralph Garci, ladies and gentlemen.

1259
01:56:22,493 --> 01:56:27,521
That's right. My name is Ralph Garci,
and I'm a professional asshole.

1260
01:56:31,373 --> 01:56:36,367
That's right. I see we have a couple
of amateurs in the audience tonight.

1261
01:56:36,813 --> 01:56:38,371
Don't we?

1262
01:56:39,693 --> 01:56:42,332
I see. How about sign language?

1263
01:56:42,493 --> 01:56:45,929
We have a standing ovation
over there.

1264
01:56:46,293 --> 01:56:49,444
That's great. Hon, where you from?

1265
01:56:50,333 --> 01:56:54,531
Okey-dokey. That's my best friend.

1266
01:56:56,013 --> 01:56:57,810
Yeah, friends are important.

1267
01:56:59,213 --> 01:57:03,206
I live in the South Bronx, and up there,
you got the Harlems of--

1268
01:57:03,493 --> 01:57:07,202
Shit! I'm sorry.
Excuse me. Fuck it.

1269
01:57:07,653 --> 01:57:09,132
That was supposed to be....

1270
01:57:09,613 --> 01:57:13,526
The north-- The countries north
of Harlem and west of Puerto Rico.

1271
01:57:13,933 --> 01:57:16,527
That's what it was supposed to be.
Yes, indeed it was.

1272
01:57:16,693 --> 01:57:18,684
Anyway, there's lots of things there:

1273
01:57:18,853 --> 01:57:22,562
Rats, cockroaches,
and, you know, little bugs.

1274
01:57:22,733 --> 01:57:26,248
You know what cockroaches are?
Little things that crawl in the night.

1275
01:57:28,173 --> 01:57:32,610
Listen, I don't mean to alarm you,
but if you don't laugh, you'll get cancer.

1276
01:57:34,693 --> 01:57:38,686
Sorry. That was probably in bad taste,
and I didn't really....

1277
01:57:42,773 --> 01:57:46,846
Excuse me. Fuck it.
Thank you very much.

1278
01:58:07,213 --> 01:58:08,282
What do you want?

1279
01:58:08,973 --> 01:58:11,043
Pizza sounds good.
You wanna eat?

1280
01:58:11,773 --> 01:58:14,492
Could you give me a break, all right?

1281
01:58:14,933 --> 01:58:17,766
We could split a special,
with anchovies, maybe.

1282
01:58:18,053 --> 01:58:23,081
Fuck anchovies. I died out there,
you're talking about fucking pizzas?

1283
01:58:23,253 --> 01:58:28,611
-No, I'm talking about eating pizzas.
-Oh, that's very funny. You're a howl.

1284
01:58:28,773 --> 01:58:31,731
You should have been out there.
The audience hated me.

1285
01:58:31,893 --> 01:58:36,045
-You had a bad night. That happens.
-Not to me, it doesn't.

1286
01:58:36,213 --> 01:58:39,364
What do you want? lnsurance?
You're in the wrong business.

1287
01:58:39,533 --> 01:58:42,331
Performers aren't safe.
We're pie-in-the-face people.

1288
01:58:42,493 --> 01:58:45,690
Look, don't lecture me.
All right, Sir Laurence?

1289
01:58:45,853 --> 01:58:49,607
All anyone ever promised you was
seven classes a day and a hot lunch.

1290
01:58:50,093 --> 01:58:51,492
The rest is up to you.

1291
01:58:51,653 --> 01:58:56,010
Back in the Middle Ages, actors,
they didn't even want to bury us.

1292
01:58:56,973 --> 01:58:58,645
Well, they do now.

1293
01:58:59,373 --> 01:59:01,887
Not if you're good.

1294
01:59:03,573 --> 01:59:05,245
How do you know?

1295
01:59:06,173 --> 01:59:08,812
How do you know if you're good?

1296
01:59:08,973 --> 01:59:11,009
Maybe you never know.

1297
01:59:16,173 --> 01:59:19,483
You just hang in, I guess.

1298
01:59:23,693 --> 01:59:25,524
You know the weirdest thing...

1299
01:59:26,333 --> 01:59:28,085
...is Freddie.

1300
01:59:28,933 --> 01:59:32,972
When he made it, he realized
it was everything he hated.

1301
01:59:33,493 --> 01:59:35,484
Cadillac Eldorado.

1302
01:59:35,653 --> 01:59:37,644
Pocketful of Quaaludes.

1303
01:59:37,813 --> 01:59:39,212
Johnny Carson.

1304
01:59:39,373 --> 01:59:41,443
It was no special shit.

1305
01:59:41,733 --> 01:59:43,849
You're not Freddie, Ralph.

1306
01:59:44,013 --> 01:59:46,402
I know that. I know.

1307
01:59:47,693 --> 01:59:51,845
Know something else about Freddie?
Freddie didn't even want to be Freddie.

1308
01:59:52,013 --> 01:59:56,006
-No?
-No. He wanted to be Joe Namath.

1309
01:59:58,253 --> 01:59:59,447
You laughed.

1310
01:59:59,613 --> 02:00:02,173
-Guess I'm funny.
-Let's get out of here.

1311
02:00:14,213 --> 02:00:15,362
5'7"?

1312
02:00:22,013 --> 02:00:24,527
Okay, you're finished.
Stand over there.

1313
02:00:24,693 --> 02:00:27,207
Go on. Keep the line moving.
Come on.
