1
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:39,198
SALESMAN 1: Yeah, it's expensive, but it's sweet.

2
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:43,372
Yeah. Are you familiar with Gibson humbucking pickups at all, or...

3
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:48,045
No, I m sorry. I actually don't play. It's for my dad for his 50th birthday.

4
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:49,540
That's... That's really sweet.

5
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:51,497
Yeah, my sisters and I are all chipping in, so...

6
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:55,585
Your dad will love these humbuckings. I mean, they realy kick ass.

7
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,091
Excuse me, I just have a quick question about...

8
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:59,844
So, what kind of music does your dad play?

9
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:01,049
Um...

10
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:04,977
I guess it's kind of jazz-ish, maybe?

11
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:08,394
This is an excellent jazz guitar. Pat Metheny plays one of these.

12
00:01:08,484 --> 00:01:10,475
- Probably the best one. - Yeah.

13
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,606
Is your dad into Metheny at all?

14
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:16,111
Oh, I'm sorry. I actually have no idea who that is.

15
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,533
Pat Metheny is probably the best fusion player of our times.

16
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,736
He's like the Jake E. Lee of fusion guitar players.

17
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:24,243
- Yeah, are you into fusion? - Yeah.

18
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:26,039
I don't really know what that is, either.

19
00:01:26,128 --> 00:01:29,995
It's just... I was asking because I... I play fusion guitar. Just curious.

20
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,420
Yeah, I play fusion, too, actually.

21
00:01:31,507 --> 00:01:32,587
SALESMAN 1: I teach kids. I work with kids

22
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:33,882
- Really? - Yeah, I work with a lot of kids.

23
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:34,924
One quick...

24
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:36,252
SALESMAN 1: You should come check our band out.

25
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:38,837
- Oh, for Christ's sake. - Okay. Sure. That's awesome.

26
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,091
Yeah. So what do you think?

27
00:01:40,182 --> 00:01:43,094
Well, do you guys maybe have it in other colors?

28
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:45,222
Color? You mean finishes.

29
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:47,270
- SALESMAN 1: Meant finishes. - Yeah, sorry.

30
00:01:47,356 --> 00:01:49,188
We have a sunburst. It's beautiful.

31
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:51,266
Yeah, I just stocked one of those in the back. I can go grab it.

32
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,441
- No, I can pick it up. - You want to see it?

33
00:01:52,528 --> 00:01:54,064
- No, I'll get it. It comes with a case. - I II get it.

34
00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:56,942
- I'm going to get the case. - CINDY: Yeah, okay. Thank you.

35
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:58,274
I'm gonna get... I'm gonna grab the case.

36
00:01:58,367 --> 00:01:59,652
CINDY: (CHUCKLING) Awesome.

37

- Mary. - Hello, Joel.

53
00:03:03,015 --> 00:03:04,756

00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:08,848

- They come in and... - That's right. They're doing...

<i>She's everything in life</i> <i>I'm ever gonna need</i>

00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:19,297
<i>It's half-price well drinks</i> <i>while the game's going.</i>

71
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,214
Well, you always give me free drinks, though.

72
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:23,338
I know. You should come by.

73
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,137
Might as well. There's no action going on at my house, that's for sure.

74
00:04:26,223 --> 00:04:28,180
Why not? Is your wife out of town?

75
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,975
No, I just haven't been laid in about a month.

76
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:37,478
Hey, did you get this job through Job 1?

77
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,317
Me, too.

78
00:04:40,404 --> 00:04:42,144
I started right there on the assembly line,

79
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,776
just like you.

80
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:47,233
Only I did better. Forty crates a day.

81
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:52,204
That's right, <i>vato</i>. I'm the best sorter in here.

82
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:57,461
Yep. Probably gonna make me floor manager at the end of this year.

83
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:59,252
- That's why they made me full-time. - You see that?

84
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:01,502
That new guy? He's holding us up.

85
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:04,300
It's not my job to tell him to hold the line, either.

86
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:08,675
Hey. My band's playing on Friday. You should check us out.

87
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:11,220
It's pronounced "God's cock."

88
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:15,095
What kind of music do you listen to? Rock?

89
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:16,305
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

90
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,810
Yeah. Yeah. You'll like this.

91
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:21,939
Ladies are free, so bring some chicks, okay?

92
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:25,901
Typica, typical.

93
00:05:26,283 --> 00:05:28,490
I'm just going to sit here.

94
00:05:28,577 --> 00:05:29,692
You're not going to shut it off?

95
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:30,947
I'm not going to hold the line.

96
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:34,951
If they're not going to do their jobs, I'm not going to do mine.

97
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:37,997
Well, if I don't get home before about 8:00,

98
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:39,327
she puts on the sweatpants,

99
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,582
and once the sweatpants are on, I get nothing.

100
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,540
You know, it's over.

101
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:44,795
Shit.

102
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,095
Damn it!

103
00:05:51,433 --> 00:05:53,345
- What are you doing? - What are you doing?

104
00:05:53,435 --> 00:05:55,391
What is he doing? That's what I want to know.

105
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,562
- Yeah? Why you ganging up on us? - That is your job.

106
00:05:57,649 --> 00:06:00,355
We can't do our job if they don't do their job!

107
00:06:00,442 --> 00:06:02,855
We're the only ones that do our work around here!

108
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:05,937
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

109
00:06:06,031 --> 00:06:08,569
What is the problem? Let's settle down.

110
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,819
Mary.

111
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,651
(SHUSHING)

112
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,370
Hector's new here, okay?

113
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:18,620
It's gonna take him a couple of days, so you've got to be patient.

114
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,702
Step, isten. This is something you're gonna have to deal with

115
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,127
if you want to be floor manager, you got that?

116
00:06:22,214 --> 00:06:23,420
Exactly.

117
00:06:23,507 --> 00:06:26,375
Great. Well, let's clean all this up, okay, and get back to rolling.

118
00:06:26,468 --> 00:06:28,300
We cannot afford to fall behind today. Let's go.

119
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:30,298
Back to your station.

120
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:33,389
See that? We always get the blame.

121
00:06:33,475 --> 00:06:35,387
Jesus, they're like a bunch of damn children, you know?

122
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:36,933
I feel like a babysitter.

123
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:39,933
Sorry I missed the drama this morning. I was showing boy genius down there

124
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:42,106
how to back up a forklift.

125
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:44,399
(SCOFFS) Look at him.

126
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:47,194
That's his whole career, you know? Driving that damn forklift.

127
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:49,398
You'd think he'd want to learn how.

128
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,733
Well, he does have that band that he's involved in, as well.

129
00:06:51,827 --> 00:06:53,613
(SCOFFS) Yeah, right. Band.

130
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:56,992
I bet you dollars to donuts he sucks at that, too.

131
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,583
- Then you got dinkus down there. - Who? Mary?

132
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,956
No, no. The other one. What's-her-face?

133
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:07,165
She asked me, or rather "aksed me," for more personal days.

134
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:08,882
Just like that.

135
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:12,427
I told her maybe if she figures out how to fill out her timesheets correctly,

136
00:07:12,514 --> 00:07:15,005
I will give her more personal days.

137
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:19,136
Don't worry. She will never fill out her timesheets correctly.

138
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,514
I better get out of here.

139
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:24,646
Got to beat that 8:00 sweatpant-deadline thing.

140
00:07:36,413 --> 00:07:38,951
Oh, shit. Do not notice me.

141
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:42,533
Do not notice me. Just go back inside. Go back inside.

142
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:45,077
God damn it! Hey.

143
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:56,632
Hey, Joel. Glad I caught you. How have you been?

144
00:07:56,725 --> 00:07:58,966
I'm in such a hurry right now, Nathan.

145
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:00,427
Yeah? You've been busy?

146
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:01,932
Yes. Very, very, very busy.

147
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:04,309
And I'm so busy right now, I gotta go make a phone call.

148
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:06,516
Gotta call the office before they all leave for the day.

149
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:10,103
Yeah. Hey, listen. Real quick, while I've got you here,

150
00:08:10,197 --> 00:08:13,064
what are you guys doing November 17th?

151
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:18,077
On the 17th? Um...

152
00:08:18,622 --> 00:08:21,410
On the 17th, I think that we're out of town.

153
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,456
Oh, yeah? Where you going?

154
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:25,081
(CLICKS TONGUE)

155
00:08:25,295 --> 00:08:28,913
- Um... - Wait a minute. I meant the seventh.

156
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:32,341
You guys will definitely be in town then, right?

157
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:33,960
Yep.

158
00:08:34,054 --> 00:08:37,172
Great. Leslie and I are going to this dinner.

159
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:40,679
It's an annual thing. We go every year with the Rotary Club.

160
00:08:40,769 --> 00:08:43,852
It's for charity. It's just a whole lot of fun.

161
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,351
And we would like to invite you and Suzie

162
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:47,852
to be our guests at our table...

163
00:08:47,943 --> 00:08:51,436
Nathan, I just... I don't think that that's something that we're gonna want to do.

164
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:52,691
- Really? - Yeah.

165
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,317
Why not? It's a lot of fun.

166
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:56,115
I don't know.

167
00:08:57,077 --> 00:09:00,410
Suzie doesn't like going to those kinds of things.

168
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:02,279
Why not?

169
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:06,538
We wouldn't know anybody, and she gets really uncomfortable.

170
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:08,210
- Oh, it's not like that. - Sure it is.

171
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:12,711
No, she won't feel uncomfortable. It's not formal or anything.

172
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:15,668
It's just a real loose bunch.

173
00:09:16,096 --> 00:09:17,086
You know, I...

174
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:19,798
Tell you what. Why don't we do this?

175
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:21,799
I'm gonna go ahead and buy those tickets,

176
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,759
since they're gonna sell out fast.

177
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:26,767
You talk to Suzie. See what she says.

178
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:29,224
Maybe I'll have Leslie give her a call.

179
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:31,934
You know how it is when the wives start talking.

180
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:33,985
(CHUCKLING)

181
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,860
- I can almost hear it... - We're gonna talk about this later.

182
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,905
Got to make the call.

183
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:53,798
Sorry, Joel, I almost forgot.

184
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:56,046
The tickets are $40 a plate.

185
00:09:56,136 --> 00:10:00,254
Now, I know that's a little bit steep, but the food is fantastic.

186
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,432
So, that's $80 total. There's no tax or anything.

187
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,429
Nathan, I really gotta get inside and make this phone call.

188
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,761
You and I are gonna talk about this some other time, okay?

189
00:10:06,855 --> 00:10:09,346
You go do that. Hey, Joel?

190
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,227
If you want us to look out after the house

191
00:10:11,318 --> 00:10:13,480
while you're gone or anything, we can do that.

192
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:15,982
- I appreciate that. - Okay. Yup.

193
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:19,240
Hey, where you guys going, anyway?

194
00:10:21,703 --> 00:10:22,783
We're going on vacation.

195
00:10:22,871 --> 00:10:27,536
Gosh, I tell you, Leslie and I would love to go on a vacation with you guys.

196

(SIGHS)

197
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,745
I gotta go.

198
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:34,963
All right then.

199
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,631
I appreciate it, Nathan. Thank you so much.

200
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:38,424
You do your thing.

201
00:10:39,721 --> 00:10:42,259
Joel? One more thing.

202
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:44,633
Hey, Joel?

203
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:53,227
- Hon. - Hi.

204
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,936
Man, that Nathan won't shut up.

205
00:10:56,029 --> 00:10:59,488
Oh, I know. What an asshole. That wife of his is even worse.

206
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:02,533
I mean, I wonder how long he would talk if you just let him go, you know?

207
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,861
I'm actually afraid to go into our own front yard sometimes

208
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:08,572
because I'm afraid he's going to be milling around.

209
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,158
Remember when we had our condo?

210
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:12,664
We could just go straight from the garage inside.

211
00:11:12,754 --> 00:11:14,370
No one would bother us.

212
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:15,625
We could walk to 7-Eleven.

213
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:16,706
(CELL PHONE BUZZING)

214
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:19,508
We didn't have to worry about plumbers or pool cleaners.

215
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:21,552
Speaking of that, we've got to hire a new pool cleaner.

216
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:24,380
He never checks the chlorine levels.

217
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:29,472
Sorry, it's just this new synthetic vanilla

218
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:31,269
has a much higher triple point than we thought,

219
00:11:31,356 --> 00:11:33,143
which means that the new cookies-and-cream extract

220
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:35,190
that we've been working on could really work,

221
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:39,236
and I just... I gotta get to this before Weber Flavors beats us to it,

222
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:42,691
'cause if something like this caught on, it could be big.

223
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:45,443
Could sell the company.

224
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:50,323
Do you remember that logo that you designed

225
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:52,578
for the original cookies-and-cream extract?

226
00:11:52,669 --> 00:11:56,003
I still have that framed in my office. Do you remember it?

227
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:59,957
Yeah. And now I design coupons.

228
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:06,469
Do you want to go to the bedroom?

229
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:11,101
- Oh, I'm a little tired. - Really?

230
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:14,556
Yeah, just... I don't know. It's the middle of the week.

231
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,732
It's not the middle of the week. It's Monday, baby.

232
00:12:16,818 --> 00:12:17,807
It's Monday? Shit!

233
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:20,019
- What happened? - <i>Dancing with the Stars.</i>

(SIGHS)

237
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:30,033
I gotta get a house that's got a bathroom

238
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:32,615
that doesn't share a wall with the TV.

239
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,620
Why would you do that?

240
00:12:34,711 --> 00:12:37,043
Because it is a little tough to jerk it

241
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:39,587
with the TV blaring at you through the wall, Dean.

242
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:41,461
Well, why don't you use one of the other two bathrooms?

243
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:43,508
It'd be too suspicious. We don't use those bathrooms.

244
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:46,008
I'll just... I'll put some insulation in or something.

245
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,509
Insulation?

246
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:51,091
You do not need to put fiberglass in your walls

247
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:53,769
because you have so much masturbation shame.

248
00:12:53,855 --> 00:12:57,063
You need to take responsibility for yourself and snap one off

249
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:59,482
wherever you want to in your own home.

250
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,937
You own your house. You own your own business.

251
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:05,023
I mean, you used to be a bartender here.

252
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:06,448
Now look at what you have.

253
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:09,027
I know, but come on. What... What, really, do I have?

254
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,532
Okay? It's a pain in the ass.

255
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,739
I work all the time. What does it get me?

256
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,825
Nobody cares about extracts, certainly not my wife.

257
00:13:14,918 --> 00:13:18,331
The stock guy with the shitty band probably gets laid more often than I do.

258
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:21,460
Yeah, but he probably lives in a really crappy apartment.

259
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:23,883
I would very gladly move into a crappy apartment

260
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,881
if the bathroom wasn't right next to the TV.

261
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:29,342
CINDY: It belonged to my father.

262
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:32,767
He passed away last month and we have all these stupid bills,

263
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:34,845
and it's just been really hard for me, you know?

264
00:13:34,938 --> 00:13:37,304
He was really into fusion.

265
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,149
You know, I'm not supposed to say this,

266
00:13:40,235 --> 00:13:42,942
but given the circumstances,

267
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:45,649
you know, you could take this down to the music store

268
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:46,981
and get a lot better deal.

269
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:49,988
No, that's okay. Really. I just wanna get this over with.

270
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:52,661
- I just want it gone. - I understand. I understand. Here.

271
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:56,707
I just... I want you to have a little extra. Here. Come on.

272
00:13:57,253 --> 00:14:00,791
- No. No, no, no. I couldn't. No. No. - No, no. Just... Just take the money.

273
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:03,793
You've been through enough already. Come on.

274
00:14:04,384 --> 00:14:06,000
Okay. Okay.

275
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,835
Oh, my gosh.

276
00:14:07,929 --> 00:14:12,264
God bless you. Thank you so much. Thank you.

00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:18,642
Hey.

278
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:21,190
Are we still looking into replacing her with a robot?

279
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:23,813
Yeah, sure. But we might not have to.

280
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:25,269
You're not gonna believe this, but remember that guy,

281
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:27,025
Michael J. Natherton from General Mills,

282
00:14:27,115 --> 00:14:29,322
who called a while back, talking like he might want to buy us out?

283
00:14:29,409 --> 00:14:31,365
Yeah. I thought you said that he wasn't serious,

284
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:32,568
he was just kicking the tires.

285
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:35,120
Yeah, well, he's serious now. He just made us an offer.

286
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,947
- I mean, a real offer. - Are you kidding me?

287
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:38,908
It must be part of some bigger strategic move,

288
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:41,914
because this is over market value, I think.

289
00:14:46,009 --> 00:14:47,216
Wow.

290
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:51,883
I might be able to finally unload all this stuff and retire, huh?

291
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,259
I mean, there's a lot of details to work out,

292
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:56,308
but, yeah, this... This could be great.

293
00:14:56,395 --> 00:15:00,139
He says he'll call back next week. What should I tell him?

294
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:03,682
You tell him, "Hell, yes."

295
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:05,393

297
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:11,399
I already warned him. This is the last time.

298
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:13,610
I'm just gonna sit here.

299
00:15:23,004 --> 00:15:24,791
Oh, no. What now?

301
00:15:37,477 --> 00:15:38,513
Oh!

302
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:13,885
I knew it. That's what happens when you don't pay attention.

303
00:16:13,972 --> 00:16:16,088
- Mmm-hmm. - Mmm-hmm.

304
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:23,730
Yeah, all right. Just call me if you hear anything else.

305
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:27,475
He definitely lost one of them, and they think

306
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,811
that they can reattach the other one, but they're not sure.

307
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:32,022
Wow. That's hardcore.

308
00:16:32,115 --> 00:16:33,652
I have no idea how this happened.

309
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:35,825
We've got such a good safety record,

310
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:37,994
and we comply with all the safety codes.

311
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,322
I think it was just some kind of a freak accident, you know?

312
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,123
Well, you probably have insurance for that, right?

313
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:45,668
Yeah, of course. He's probably gonna get a huge settlement.

314
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:47,495
Yeah, I would think so.

315
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:50,456
I mean, it's your balls.

316
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:55,385
It kind of makes you think, doesn't it, how fragile we all are?

317
00:16:55,847 --> 00:16:59,181
Especially our balls. They're just hanging there.

318
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:01,134
A little sack.

319
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:04,348
Any minute, could just be cut off forever.

320
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,146
What'd ife be like, walking around without testicles?

321
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:08,519
Can you imagine that shit?

322
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:11,022
Yeah, actually, I rarely use my balls anymore at all.

323
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:12,067
What about the other night?

324
00:17:12,155 --> 00:17:14,112
I thought you were gonna rub one out to <i>Dancing with the Stars</i>.

325
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,155
I mean that, you know,

326
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:19,486
Suzie and I have sex maybe once every three months.

327
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:23,117
You know, sexual frustration is really hard.

328
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:25,912
But I may have a solution.

329
00:17:26,461 --> 00:17:29,124
- What? - You need to take some Xanax.

330
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,044
Xanax? Isn't that for anxiety?

331
00:17:33,134 --> 00:17:36,877
It's good for all psychological problems in the DSM-IV.

332
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:41,177
Xanax basically just makes you feel good.

333
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:44,263
That's why it works for everything.

334
00:17:44,896 --> 00:17:47,479
I take it for the common head cold.

335
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:51,643
I think it would work great for sexual frustration.

336
00:17:51,903 --> 00:17:53,815
- Want me to get you some? - No, I don't.

337
00:17:53,905 --> 00:17:57,898
You know what else is good? Codeine cough syrup.

338
00:17:58,618 --> 00:18:00,734
- For what? - It's just good.

340
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:40,862

00:18:40,952 --> 00:18:43,490
- <i>One moment.</i> - Can I have the address, please?

342
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,320
<i>I'm sorry</i>. <i>I'm not showing anything for either</i>.

343
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:47,998
<i>There's a D. Wilkinson,</i> <i>but it's unlisted.</i>

344
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,035
Okay. Thank you.

345
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:56,958
So, the guys at General Mills

346
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:59,759
got wind of this whole testicular incident

347
00:18:59,846 --> 00:19:01,586
and they're worried.

348
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,968
If Step decides to sue us beyond the insurance settlement,

349
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:06,550
that could be a serious liability.

350
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,307
How is Step doing, anyway?

351
00:19:08,396 --> 00:19:11,138
Better. I guess he might be going home today.

352
00:19:11,232 --> 00:19:12,221
Oh, good.

353
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:13,648
Anyway, I guess we don't have to worry about it.

354
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:15,977
He says he's not going to sue us.

355
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:17,936
(IMITATING STEP) Says he wouldn't want something for nothing,

356
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:20,489
you know, and what's right is right.

357
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,737
He's being pretty mellow about this.

358
00:19:22,827 --> 00:19:24,067
Yeah.

359
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:27,579
I think when you lose your balls, it kind of mellows you out.

360
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,000
Oh, by the way, guess who asked for a raise today?

361
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:34,578
- Who? - Dinkus. Can you believe that?

362
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,505
Brian, you know, you call everyone here dinkus.

363
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:38,423
I don't know who you're talking about.

364
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,593
- You know, forklift dinkus. - Oh.

365
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:44,005
I thought you call him "boy genius."

366
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:46,932
Oh, right. Yeah. Well, boy genius asked for a raise.

367
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,349
I said, "Are you kidding me?

368
00:19:48,436 --> 00:19:49,846
"You almost got somebody killed last week."

369
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:52,305
And then he tried to blame it on dinkus over there.

370
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,516
You know, you really ought to learn the employees' names.

371
00:19:54,609 --> 00:19:56,224
Yeah, I was thinking about that, but then I figured,

372
00:19:56,319 --> 00:19:58,856
hey, if this deal goes through next week, I won't have to.

373
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:03,532
It's not like I'm gonna be inviting dinkus and boy genius over for dinner.

374
00:20:03,743 --> 00:20:07,031
Oh, Joel, let me introduce you to the new temps here.

375
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:09,454
One of them wanted to meet you.

376
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,453
Joe, this is Cindy.

377
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,539
- Hi. - Hi.

378
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,291
(MOUTHING) Oh, my God.

379
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:20,124
And...

380
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:23,713
I'm sorry. I forgot your name.

381
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:24,921
- Victor. - Victor! Right.

382
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:27,175
Hi, Joel. Welcome.

383
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,971
- Okay. - BRIAN: Mmm-hmm.

384
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:43,529
- Hey. - Hi.

385
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:50,405
Look, I'm so sorry, but are you really the owner of this entire place?

386
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,367
Yeah.

387
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:55,497
I mean, like, you... You started it and everything?

388
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:58,170
Yeah. Yeah, pretty much.

389
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,332
Oh, my God. How?

390
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:06,887
Just... You really wanna hear this? A lot of people think it's boring.

391
00:21:06,973 --> 00:21:09,715
No, no. I... Really, I do. I wanna know.

392
00:21:09,809 --> 00:21:13,097
I mean, did you, like, invent extract or something?

393
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:16,431
- Kind of. - Really?

394
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:18,606
Well, my mother used to...

395
00:21:18,693 --> 00:21:21,730
My mother used to make these root-beer cookies,

396
00:21:21,821 --> 00:21:24,233
and I always noticed that the cookie dough

397
00:21:24,325 --> 00:21:25,940
tasted better than the cookies themselves,

398
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:27,194
and I thought, "Why is that?"

399
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,991
And it turns out that a lot of the flavor

400
00:21:29,078 --> 00:21:31,661
in the root-beer extract evaporates when you cook it,

401
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:35,082
and so when I was in graduate school, in chemistry,

402
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:38,001
I figured out a way to use this synthetic derivative

403
00:21:38,087 --> 00:21:40,954
of the wintergreen component, and it just...

404
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:45,544
It doesn't evaporate as easily. And from that, you know...

405
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:47,714
Wow.

406
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:52,637
I mean, you... You figured all of that out, like, with your brain!

407
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:55,560
- Yeah. - Oh, you must be really rich.

408
00:21:56,022 --> 00:21:59,310
I've got a 7 Series BMW and some pretty nice clothes.

409
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:01,392
You know so many people.

410
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:04,650
- I... - Oh, my God. You are really popular.

411
00:22:06,115 --> 00:22:07,571
(LAUGHING)

412
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:09,525
What?

413
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:13,112
It's just really cute how your sixes look like eights.

414
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,617
Or is it more ike your eights look like sixes?

415
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:17,074
Which one is it?

416
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,659
Hey, dude. You wanna hit some golf balls, man?

417
00:22:18,753 --> 00:22:20,869
Hey, Dean, Cindy, here.

418
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:22,421
Oh, damn.

419
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:25,632
Goodness. Hi, Dean.

420
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:28,050
Entrepreneur, spirtualist, healer.

421
00:22:28,137 --> 00:22:29,173
- Okay. - Nice to meet you.

422
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:30,971
Nice to meet you. Thank you, Mr. Reynolds.

423
00:22:31,057 --> 00:22:32,343
- Thank you. Thank you. - Welcome aboard.

424
00:22:32,433 --> 00:22:35,141
We're gonna play some golf, but maybe we could all just hang out?

425
00:22:35,229 --> 00:22:36,890
- Dean? - Dude.

426
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,520
Does she work here?

427
00:22:39,607 --> 00:22:40,847
Yeah, she's a temp.

428
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:43,809
- She's a tramp? - Temp!

429
00:22:43,903 --> 00:22:47,317
And please don't stare at her. Get away from the window.

430
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:50,273
I like it, Joel. I like your style.

431
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:53,076
Well, I didn't hire her. She came over through Job 1.

432
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:54,993
They just sent her over like everyone else.

433
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:59,701
Job 1, huh? I got to give those guys a call, man.

434
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:04,880
I have never seen a woman anywhere near that hot working here.

435
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:09,050
Makes sense, though, huh? I mean, hot girls need jobs, too, right?

436
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:11,385
Do they really?

437
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:16,049
I mean, most of your temps look like winos, man, and they're guys.

438
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:19,057
- You wanna hear something weird, too? - Yeah.

439
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:21,559
I think that she was flirting with me.

440
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,059
Really?

441
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:25,393
- Could be wrong. - No, I'm sure, man.

442
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:28,229
Dude, you could probably have any girl out there, that's walking around,

443
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:30,565
anyone that you see right now with the hairnet on, man,

444
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:31,647
you could probably nail.

445
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:34,076
- I don't know about that. - I'm telling you, man,

446
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:35,493
you're the king of this whole domain.

447
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,445
This is your place. You're the ruler here.

448
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:39,531
You're the king of the...

449
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:40,866
What is this shit you're making out here?

450
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:43,076
It's extract, and it's spray-dried flavoring, and...

451
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:45,208
You're the extract king, man.

452
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:47,539
And these females out here sense that,

453
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:49,671
and you can have them if you want that, you know?

454
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:53,346
I personally wouldn't, because they're not sexually attractive to me,

455
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:56,298
but, you know, that girl right there,

456
00:23:56,894 --> 00:23:59,180
- good for you, Joe. - MARY: Somebody stole my purse!

457
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:00,602
What the shit?

458
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:05,729
My purse is stolen! It's gone! He did it! He stole my purse! You!

459
00:24:05,818 --> 00:24:07,605
You stole my purse! He did it!

460
00:24:07,695 --> 00:24:09,277
- He did t! He stole my purse! - Hey, wait, wait!

461
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:10,354
- I told you about him! - Calm down!

462
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:11,438
Calm down one minute, will you?

463
00:24:11,532 --> 00:24:13,740
I'm not gonna calm down! I'm gonna call the cops!

464
00:24:13,826 --> 00:24:17,285
Will you please time out? I speak the language, okay? Hector.

465
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:21,699
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

466
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:25,373
- You know, purse-o? - Purse! That's right!

467
00:24:25,463 --> 00:24:26,624
You stole my purse and took my money!

468
00:24:26,714 --> 00:24:28,500
- Wait a minute! Wait a minute, okay? - He stole my purse.

469
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:31,128
Give me a break, please? How do you know it's stolen?

470
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,586
I know it's stolen because it's gone, that's how!

471
00:24:33,681 --> 00:24:34,635
What does it look like?

472
00:24:34,722 --> 00:24:37,134
It's a white leather multi-colored patchwork purse

473
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:40,343
wth a turquoise lining and a cute little teddy bear in a tutu!

474

00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,295
Are you sure?

That's really, really sweet of you. Thank you.

I can't believe I'm buying Reynold's Extract.

492
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:07,805
I mean, I work at the factory, you know?

493
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,016
Really? I work there, too.

494
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:11,731
Are you serious?

495
00:26:11,819 --> 00:26:15,278
Yeah, I sure do. Well, I used to, but... Yeah.

496
00:26:15,656 --> 00:26:17,488
Well, I just started working there.

497
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:20,442
Yeah, I'm the fastest sorter there.

498
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:23,828
- Really? - Yeah. Forty crates a day.

499
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:26,740
They were gonna make me floor manager.

500
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:27,950
Well, I'm Cindy.

(DOOR CLOSES)

502
00:26:46,188 --> 00:26:49,601
We don't do it anymore, you know? It's... We just... I don't know what to do.

503
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:53,275
We're turning into one of those brother-sister couples.

504
00:26:53,694 --> 00:26:55,355
You do kind of look alike.

505
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,107
- No, we don't. - Okay.

506
00:26:57,615 --> 00:26:58,822
And to make things worse,

507
00:26:58,909 --> 00:27:02,948
Dean, I cannot get that Cindy girl out of my mind.

508
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:06,534
And how often am I going to meet a girl that pretty

509
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:09,616
and that into food flavoring? It's just...

510
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:11,291
You know she practically asked me out?

511
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,290
She gave me her phone number and everything.

512
00:27:13,382 --> 00:27:16,044
Asked me if I was going to that party where Rory's band is playing.

513
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:17,295
- Can you believe that? - Really?

514
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:19,217
- Yeah. - What are you going to do?

515
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:20,292
What do you mean, what am I gonna do?

516
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:21,970
I'm gonna do nothing. I can't cheat on Suzie.

517
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:25,140
I just got to power through it until I'm too old to get it up, you know?

518
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:26,386
Then I'II be all right.

519
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,308
What if Suzie cheated on you?

520
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:30,729
(SCOFFS) Right. Come on.

521
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:34,023
Listen, man. I like Suzie. You know what I'm saying?

522
00:27:34,111 --> 00:27:35,646
And I got nothing against her,

523
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:39,400
but what if she's feeling the same way you were? Right?

524
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:42,782
What if she cheated on you? Would that bother you?

525
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:48,747
I don't... No, I guess... No, I guess it wouldn't, at this point.

526
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:50,539
I guess that's a little weird, isn't it?

527
00:27:50,626 --> 00:27:53,743
Yeah, a bit, but, you know, do you think she would do it?

528
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:55,328
- What? Cheat on me? No. - You sure?

529
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:57,914
Well, I don't know, actually. Hang on. She might.

530
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:00,250
Suzie might. She could be tempted, I suppose.

531
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:02,586
If some really studly guy hit on her...

532
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:07,141
So, you're saying that she would cheat on you

533
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:08,842
if she were placed in temptation's way,

534
00:28:08,936 --> 00:28:11,723
and yet you're in temptation's way and you're not cheating on her?

535
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:13,555
- That's right. - Okay, bro.

536
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,015
Here's what you need to do.

537
00:28:15,109 --> 00:28:17,977
- I don't want drugs, Dean. - There are ways,

538
00:28:18,739 --> 00:28:22,323
ancient ways from Aztec times

539
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:27,452
of getting your wife to cheat on you, if that is what you need.

540
00:28:27,538 --> 00:28:28,653
Let's hear it.

541
00:28:28,749 --> 00:28:31,740
You hire a gigolo

542
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:35,539
to have an affair with your wife.

543
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:40,124
- What? - I'm serious, bro. I know a guy.

544
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:42,049
- You know a gigolo? - Yes, I do.

545
00:28:42,136 --> 00:28:43,297
How do you know a gigolo?

546
00:28:43,387 --> 00:28:45,173
- This guy, Brad. - Brad the gigolo?

547
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:49,008
Yes, who comes in here all the time. He's friends of Cliff.

548
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:52,094
You hire Brad. He has an affair with Suzie.

549
00:28:52,521 --> 00:28:55,012
All right. Yeah. Don't you have another customer to help or something?

550
00:28:55,107 --> 00:28:57,098
Dude, you just told me that you wouldn't mind

551
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:58,730
if she fooled around with somebody else.

552
00:28:58,819 --> 00:28:59,855
And if she fools around with somebody else,

553
00:28:59,947 --> 00:29:02,904
you have no guilty feelings about hooking up with Cindy.

554
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:08,236
All your problems are solved. Stroke-of-genius idea on my part.

555
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:10,741
Jesus Christ, maybe I will try some of your Xanax.

556
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:12,617
- Come on. - Seriously.

557
00:29:13,417 --> 00:29:15,328
I think what I'm gonna do is, I'm gonna sit Suzie down

558
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,454
and I'm just gonna talk to her about it.

559
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:19,127
- Bing! - No, that was a joke.

560
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:20,922
Not a joke.

561
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:22,795
- Joking. - Serious.

562
00:29:25,012 --> 00:29:26,969
This gonna shut you up?

563
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:31,679
Tell me what this stuff does, again.

564
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:36,721
STEP: Yeah, I just believe what's right is right.

565
00:29:36,817 --> 00:29:38,147
CINDY: That's right, Step.

566
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:41,271
And what's right is for you to send a message

567
00:29:41,363 --> 00:29:45,902
so that a horrible accident like this never happens to anybody ever again.

568
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:48,450
That's why I got a lawyer for you.

569
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,867
You want to know who?

570
00:29:51,205 --> 00:29:54,117
- Who? - The guy on all the bus-stop benches.

571
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,746
- Joe Adler? You got me Joe Adler? - Mmm-hmm.

572
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:58,042
Yeah.

573
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,871
You're so good to me, Cindy.

574
00:30:05,886 --> 00:30:08,298
Okay. Oh, my gosh. Step, I'm sorry.

575
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:10,300
You're getting me aroused,

576
00:30:10,392 --> 00:30:12,053
and I'm getting you aroused,

577
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:14,634
and your doctor said that you should not get aroused

578
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,560
till after the trial.

579
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:18,809
Step, I'm so sorry.

580
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:22,608
I'm sorry. I think we should go. I'm sorry.

581
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:29,653
STEP: Man. Look at all them mallards.

582
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:32,577
I knew I should have brought the Mossberg.

583
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:34,953
DEAN: Shit.

584
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:37,784
Do you remember what color that pill was I gave you?

585
00:30:37,877 --> 00:30:40,085
- What? - Damn it.

586
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,336
I don't think it was Xanax.

587
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:45,882
Could have been Ritalin or Special K.

588
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:49,752
I don't care. What?

589
00:30:49,847 --> 00:30:53,465
Well, Special K is a horse tranquilizer.

590
00:30:53,559 --> 00:30:56,017
It sometimes has weird effects on humans.

591
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:57,513
Hey, it's nothing to worry about.

592
00:30:57,605 --> 00:31:00,268
Probably just shouldn't drink anymore.

593
00:31:00,858 --> 00:31:02,315
Remember that thing you were talking about?

594
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:04,518
- About the gigolo? - Yeah?

595
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:06,648
You don't think that is wrong?

596
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,401
You don't think that that is morally wrong?

597
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:09,948
What could be morally wrong about that?

598
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:11,615
Yeah, I don't know.

599
00:31:11,702 --> 00:31:15,161
Look, man. If she doesn't wanna do anything,

600
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:17,159
she doesn't have to, okay?

601
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:20,538
But if she does, then she's the one who sinned,

602
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:21,913
and you're the one who can go out there

603
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:24,371
and drop the Joel-pole in whoever the hell you want to.

604
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:26,001
And that's what's morally appropriate.

605
00:31:26,093 --> 00:31:30,051
I cannot... I can't see anything morally wrong with it, either,

606
00:31:30,137 --> 00:31:32,345
and... And he's a friend of yours, right? What is his name?

607
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:33,637
Brad. You want me to get on the phone with him?

608
00:31:33,724 --> 00:31:35,056
No, no. Just hang on.

609
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:37,976
It's very weird to even talk about this, Dean.

610
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:43,307
Dude, all you got to do is tell her he's coming to be the new pool guy

611
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:46,769
or whatever, and see what happens. Seriously.

612
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:50,401
If she doesn't go for it, terrific.

613
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:53,700
Now you just feel better for not fooling around in the first place.

614
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:57,241
I think you're right, and we do need a new pool cleaner.

615
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:58,741
That's a sign, bro.

616
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:01,826
Yeah, I just... I don't know. It's so nuts.

617
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:05,207
You got to listen to the universe.

618
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:07,630
Why don't you have another drink, man?

619
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:09,877
You know what? Why don't I go call Brad?

620
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:12,086
See what he has to say about this?

621
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,715
What the hell.

622
00:32:15,724 --> 00:32:20,309
It seems pretty clear, right? I mean, it's $200, right?

623
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:21,978
Yeah. It's 200.

624
00:32:22,648 --> 00:32:25,936
Well, yeah. I mean, you know, I'm getting my 10%.

625
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:28,063
Come on, Dean. What are you? You're a pimp now?

626
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:31,192
I don't think they call it a pimp when it's with a male prostitute, Joel.

627
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:33,694
- All right. - DEAN: They have another name for it.

628
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:36,652
It's not a john, but it's something like that.

629
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:38,361
They call it something else.

630
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:39,697
Look, I'm the one who hooked this whole thing up.

631
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:40,779
- I get it. - DEAN: Okay?

632
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:42,286
You have nothing to worry about 'cause it all comes out

633
00:32:42,376 --> 00:32:43,662
- of his money, anyway. - All right!

634
00:32:43,752 --> 00:32:45,663
- Fine. - So, it's $200.

635
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:47,211
Yep. 220.

636
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:49,005
- Dean! - What?

637
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:50,832
I have a question.

638
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,375
Yep.

639
00:32:54,181 --> 00:32:57,138
So, are you, like, gonna watch or something?

640
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:02,469
No, no. No, no. No, I'm... I'm not even gonna be there.

641
00:33:02,564 --> 00:33:05,145
I'm gonna be at work. Don't you remember? We covered this.

642
00:33:05,232 --> 00:33:08,395
- Didn't we cover this? - Look, dude, here's the story.

643
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:10,352
What you're gonna do is,

644
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:13,189
you're just gonna go to Joel's house, okay,

645
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:15,490
pretending to be the new pool cleaner.

646
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:19,694
When you get there, you will simply attempt to seduce Joel's wife.

647
00:33:19,788 --> 00:33:21,494
If she does not respond,

648
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:23,664
you will simply clean the pool and leave.

649
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:25,708
That's it. It's just that simple.

650
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:32,415
So you're not gonna, like, try to touch my ass or anything?

651
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:40,766
Listen. He will be at work.

652
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:44,932
You will go by when he is not there,

653
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:49,394
and you will pose as the pool cleaner

654
00:33:49,818 --> 00:33:52,059
trying to seduce the wife.

655
00:33:53,323 --> 00:33:54,732
(LAUGHING)

656
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:56,654
I see. Yeah. I get it now.

657
00:33:56,742 --> 00:33:58,107
- It's so simple. - BRAD: Yeah. I'm sorry. Cool.

658
00:33:58,202 --> 00:33:59,659
Yeah. You're not even gonna be there.

659
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:01,531
DEAN: No, he will not be there.

660
00:34:01,623 --> 00:34:04,239
He will not be at the house. You will be at the house.

661
00:34:04,334 --> 00:34:06,289
The wife will be at the house. He will...

662
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:08,369
- BRAD: Not be... - Not be at the house.

663
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:11,876
Cool. No problem. This is gonna be great.

664
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:14,833
Now, I want you to remember that she might not go for it.

665
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:17,043
So, awesome, yeah. No, I can hardly wait.

666
00:34:17,137 --> 00:34:18,969
- She might not go for it. - This is going to be awesome.

667
00:34:19,056 --> 00:34:22,675
Awesome. Hey, man, if you know of anybody else

668
00:34:22,768 --> 00:34:27,559
who might need, you know, what I do, like lonely housewives and shit,

669
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:28,809
you think you could tell them about me?

670
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,231
Because I figure if I can get enough of them,

671
00:34:31,318 --> 00:34:33,775
then maybe I could quit my landscaping job.

672
00:34:33,862 --> 00:34:37,070
That would be awesome, because I hate landscaping, dude,

673
00:34:37,157 --> 00:34:39,364
and I like getting laid a lot better.

674
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:42,659
And I'm always seeing all kinds of horny housewives out at the clubs,

675
00:34:42,746 --> 00:34:44,862
so, like I say, if your wife has any housewife...

676
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:48,121
Brad, you're killing me, man. All right? Good talking to you.

677
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:51,202
- All right. - Good talking, all right, bro? Later.

678
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:52,503
BRAD: Oh? You know what else I was thinking, man?

679
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:55,081
- Later on, Brad. Good night, man. - BRAD: All right, cool.

680
00:34:55,175 --> 00:34:58,588
Hey, let me give you a ride home. You're not in any condition to drive.

681
00:34:58,679 --> 00:34:59,920
I know.

682
00:35:00,889 --> 00:35:03,632
This... Are you sure about this guy? This...

683
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:06,226
DEAN: Oh, yeah, man. He's real cool.

684
00:35:06,313 --> 00:35:08,554
He just gets a little fred up before each job.

685
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:11,309
It's just... He doesn't seem that bright.

686
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:15,731
I mean, what do you expect? He's a whore.

687
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:37,463
CINDY: Hey.

688
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:41,385
Wow, looks like you had one of those nights, huh?

689
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:44,010
So, where was I?

690
00:35:51,106 --> 00:35:52,972
Oh, shit.

691
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:55,646
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

692
00:35:55,737 --> 00:35:57,318
- Hello? - Hey, Dean.

693
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:59,646
- <i>Joel.</i> - Thank God you're awake.

694
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:02,152
Did that really happen last night?

695
00:36:02,242 --> 00:36:05,405
We go through with that? That gigolo stuff?

696
00:36:05,704 --> 00:36:06,864
As far as I know.

697
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:09,572
- <i>God damn it!</i> - What?

698
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:12,829
<i>What was I thinking?</i> <i>We got to call that off right now.</i>

699
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,583
<i>Can you call that guy?</i> <i>What's his name?</i>

700
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:18,623
Brad. Okay. Yeah, man. I'll call him.

701
00:36:18,717 --> 00:36:20,925
<i>Yeah, tell him I'll pay him anyway.</i> <i>Not to... Not to worry about it.</i>

702
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,422
<i>Just tell him not to go over there.</i>

703
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:24,505
What was I thinking?

704
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:27,010
<i>All right, chill. Chill. I'll call him</i>.

705
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:29,262
Thanks for the drugs, Dean.

706
00:36:31,188 --> 00:36:35,648
Actually, I don't have his digits.

707
00:36:36,193 --> 00:36:37,980
What're you talking about? Thought you called him last night.

708
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:41,688
- Yeah, but I got his number from Cliff. - <i>You get it from Cliff again.</i>

709
00:36:41,782 --> 00:36:45,195
Cliff doesn't have a phone right now. I got it from him at the bar.

710
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:46,947
Motherfucker!

711
00:36:49,289 --> 00:36:52,827
What's the boy's last name? I'll call information.

712
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:55,242
I don't remember. It's a Mexican name.

713
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:56,418
Mexican?

714
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:57,585
For Christ's sake, Dean,

715
00:36:57,673 --> 00:36:59,539
the guy's got blonde hair and blue eyes. Come on.

716
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:02,045
I thought it was strange, too, a guy who looks like that

717
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:05,128
had a Mexican last name, but I don't judge people, you know?

718
00:37:05,222 --> 00:37:08,556
<i>I mean, might not have been Mexican.</i> <i>Could have been a Filipino name.</i>

719
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:12,135
I think it's Lopez or Sanchez.

720
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:14,596
Or Gutiижrrez.

721
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:17,478
Shit. I got to get home and head him off.

722
00:37:18,485 --> 00:37:19,817
- Joel, we got to talk. - Not now, Brian.

723
00:37:19,903 --> 00:37:20,893
- It's kind of important. - Not now, pal.

724
00:37:20,989 --> 00:37:21,943
- Not now. - It's kind of really important.

725
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:23,190
- It's about Step. - JENNY: There's a Brad Chavez

726
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:25,023
on Line 1 for you.

727
00:37:27,369 --> 00:37:29,702
- Who? - Brad Chavez.

728
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:31,746
Brad Chavez?

729
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:33,322
You want me to take a message?

730
00:37:33,418 --> 00:37:37,286
No, no. That's the pool cleaner. I better take that.

731
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,295
Hello?

732
00:37:40,382 --> 00:37:42,248
- <i>Hey, is this Joel?</i> - Yes, it is.

733
00:37:42,342 --> 00:37:44,458
- Hey, man. It's Brad. - <i>Hey. Thank God.</i>

734
00:37:44,554 --> 00:37:46,010
Mission accomplished, dude.

735
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:48,679
<i>It worked. She totally went for it.</i>

736
00:37:49,726 --> 00:37:53,639
You were not even supposed to be there for another 45 minutes.

737
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:56,179
Oh, really? Yeah.

738
00:37:57,192 --> 00:37:59,103
I totally forgot what time you guys told me,

739
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:02,652
<i>and I was so excited about it</i> <i>I just went over there.</i>

740
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:05,358
Um...

741
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:10,360
So, then, you... She actually... You guys...

742
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:12,161
Yep. It was easy.

743
00:38:13,081 --> 00:38:15,539
Easy? What does that mean, easy?

744
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:20,119
No, I don't mean easy like she was easy or anything like,

745
00:38:20,215 --> 00:38:22,422
"Your wife's a slut," or anything.

746
00:38:22,509 --> 00:38:25,376
I just meant it wasn't hard to get her to...

747
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:27,467
Never mind.

748
00:38:27,554 --> 00:38:30,422
Tell me. Tell me what happened. I want to hear it all.

749
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:32,677
- You sure? - Yeah. I'm sure.

750
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:37,099
Okay. Well, she let me in,

751
00:38:37,731 --> 00:38:39,813
so I just went back like I was cleaning the pool,

752
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,516
<i>and I don't know anything</i> <i>about pool cleaning, right?</i>

753
00:38:42,612 --> 00:38:45,023
<i>So, I was totally just faking it,</i>

754
00:38:45,447 --> 00:38:47,063
<i>and she was in her bathing suit,</i>

755
00:38:47,157 --> 00:38:49,739
<i>so I struck up a conversation.</i>

756
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:52,326
This is a really nice house.

757
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:53,777
Thank you.

758
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:56,159
Is it your dad's house?

759
00:38:56,583 --> 00:38:58,324
No, it's... It's ours.

760
00:38:58,418 --> 00:39:01,251
Oh. Wow.

761
00:39:01,338 --> 00:39:05,628
You look so young to be living in a house this nice.

762
00:39:05,717 --> 00:39:06,706
(GIGGLING)

763
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:08,134
What?

764
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:12,922
Do you have any sunscreen? I forgot mine.

765
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:15,219
Sure.

766
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:17,141
<i>BRAD: And, see, I thought that was</i> <i>pretty smart of me, right,</i>

767
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:18,844
to ask to borrow the sunscreen,

768
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:22,431
because that way I could ask if she wanted some

769
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:24,518
and I could rub some on her back, right?

770
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:26,853
Instead of me just coming out and asking to rub some on her back.

771
00:39:26,947 --> 00:39:29,485
It was pretty smooth, huh?

772
00:39:29,576 --> 00:39:34,070
<i>Anyway, once I started rubbing lotion</i> <i>all over her body,</i>

773
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:36,369
- <i>the rest was pretty easy. She...</i> - All right! That's it!

774
00:39:36,456 --> 00:39:38,413
Stop it! I don't need to hear any more.

775
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:40,206
Okay. Okay, dude.

776
00:39:40,295 --> 00:39:44,083
Well, hey, listen, if you have anyone else that

777
00:39:44,172 --> 00:39:47,505
you want to referral me to

778
00:39:47,594 --> 00:39:50,677
or, like, if you want me to do your wife again, I can...

779
00:39:50,762 --> 00:39:53,003
No! I've got to go. Goodbye.

780
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,561
- Oh! Damn it! - Yoo-hoo. Hey!

781
00:40:05,652 --> 00:40:07,643
- How's it going? - I'm real busy, actually.

782
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:09,900
Well, I'm not gonna keep you long.

783
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:12,858
I went ahead and got those tickets for that dinner

784
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:15,943
we talked about going to together on the seventh.

785
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:18,655
I think I mentioned that they were 40 apiece.

786
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:22,538
Well, as it turns out, they're a tad more this year. 55.

787
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:24,494
I told you that we really didn't want to go to that thing.

788
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:25,577
Don't you remember that?

789
00:40:25,672 --> 00:40:28,255
I know you said something about Suzie feeling uncomfortable,

790
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:31,380
but like I say, she won't feel uncomfortable at all.

791
00:40:31,471 --> 00:40:34,132
She could wear a pantsuit, if that's the issue.

792
00:40:34,222 --> 00:40:37,340
- It's not formal or anything. - No. It's not the problem, Nathan.

793
00:40:37,434 --> 00:40:40,597
What? Does she not like to wear a dress ever?

794
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:42,177
I gotta go.

795
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:45,356
One more thing! I'm busy, too.

796
00:40:55,911 --> 00:41:00,155
Joel, I was thinking, maybe we could go on vacation,

797
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:01,992
just the two of us.

798
00:41:02,085 --> 00:41:04,371
We haven't done something like that in a long time,

799
00:41:04,461 --> 00:41:07,579
and I know they have really great deals right now in the Caribbean.

800
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:09,539
I hate the Caribbean.

801
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:11,623
Really? Why?

802
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:13,380
'Cause it sucks.

803
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:17,965
But I thought you liked going to hot places,

804
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:20,471
you know, so you can wear your shorts.

805
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:23,552
I don't feel so good. I'm gonna go to bed.

806
00:41:24,773 --> 00:41:26,389
Is it the food?

807
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:47,001
Well, actually, I'm in, like, five bands right now,

808
00:41:47,088 --> 00:41:50,329
but God's Cock is basically the same four guys as Fight Head,

809
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:53,416
but Fight Head's more of, like, a thrash skate-punk-type thing,

810
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:56,844
whereas God's Cock is more like melodic grindcore.

811
00:41:56,931 --> 00:42:00,389
So, it's five bands, but it's four groups of guys.

812
00:42:01,978 --> 00:42:05,219
She is so nice. I wish they'd hire more people like her.

813
00:42:05,313 --> 00:42:06,554
Mmm-hmm.

814
00:42:07,108 --> 00:42:09,849
Can't believe he's still working here.

815
00:42:09,943 --> 00:42:12,184
Did you know that Sylvia's wallet is missing?

816
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,860
She thinks it was stolen.

817
00:42:13,947 --> 00:42:15,903
And guess who was in the locker room last?

818
00:42:15,992 --> 00:42:17,356
Hector.

819
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:20,530
Hey. Did you guys hear the rumor?

820
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:22,282
Jim said Joel and Brian are going to sell the company.

821
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:24,034
Rich said the same thing, too.

822
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:27,036
He said they'll probably make millions and billions of dollars, too.

823
00:42:27,128 --> 00:42:28,708
Shut the fuck up.

824
00:42:28,795 --> 00:42:29,784
You mean, I'm working my ass off

825
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,496
and those guys are gonna make all that money?

826
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:33,376
I work harder than anybody.

827
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:37,210
If you add it all up, I lift over 200,000 pounds a week.

828
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:38,510
We should do something.

829
00:42:38,597 --> 00:42:39,929
- Mmm-hmm. - Mmm-hmm.

830
00:42:40,016 --> 00:42:42,974
Here. Ladies are free, so bring some chicks.

831
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:44,597
GABRIELLA: Mmm-hmm.

832
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:47,262
- You got a sec? - Yeah.

833
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:49,016
I think we might have a really big problem here.

834
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:50,393
I don't know what happened, but all of a sudden,

835
00:42:50,485 --> 00:42:52,567
Step says he doesn't want to settle anymore.

836
00:42:52,652 --> 00:42:54,518
I think he might have talked to a lawyer.

837
00:42:54,614 --> 00:42:57,230
Like I say, the General Mills guys don't wanna make the offer official

838
00:42:57,324 --> 00:42:59,030
until this whole thing is settled, so...

839
00:42:59,117 --> 00:43:01,530
All right, well, don't worry about it.

840
00:43:01,621 --> 00:43:03,407
Step's probably just chest-beating, you know?

841
00:43:03,498 --> 00:43:05,534
He does this all the time. He gets all wound up, talks big,

842
00:43:05,625 --> 00:43:07,081
and then he usually backs down.

843
00:43:07,168 --> 00:43:09,284
And that was with his balls, so,

844
00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:12,541
- I'll talk to him. - Okay, All right. The sooner the better.

845
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:17,340
(NATHAN EXCLAIMS)

846
00:43:17,427 --> 00:43:19,134
There he is. Hey.

847
00:43:20,347 --> 00:43:22,179
I can't talk today.

00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:28,681
How is he?

851
00:43:28,773 --> 00:43:30,478
We're thinking about changing services.

852
00:43:30,565 --> 00:43:34,434
I got to get inside... Hang on, you mean yesterday, right?

853
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:36,143
- Huh? - The pool cleaner that you saw,

854
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:38,355
you saw him yesterday, not today, right?

855
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:40,440
No, today. The new guy.

856
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:44,534
What did he look like?

857
00:43:44,621 --> 00:43:47,329
Well, you know, blonde-haired kid about yea high.

858
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:49,952
Good-looking kid. Real good-looking.

859
00:43:50,043 --> 00:43:51,284
In fact, Leslie even commented...

860
00:43:51,378 --> 00:43:53,460
You're absolutely sure that you saw him today,

861
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:54,878
and not yesterday?

862
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:56,331
- Yeah. - No doubt?

863
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:59,461
No, no doubt about it. It was today. I came home for lunch.

864
00:43:59,554 --> 00:44:02,215
Yesterday, I had this bear of a sales conference.

Look, don't worry about it, dude.

875
00:44:30,418 --> 00:44:31,407
I won't charge you for this one.

00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:33,496
You had sex with my wife again?

877
00:44:33,588 --> 00:44:38,331
Well, I figured we already did it once, so what's the big deal, right?

878
00:44:38,425 --> 00:44:41,668
- Besides, I'm not going to charge you. - You're not going to charge...

879
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:43,501
You are going to charge me and I am going to pay you,

880
00:44:43,597 --> 00:44:46,213
because you are not going to have sex with my wife for free, all right?

881
00:44:46,309 --> 00:44:50,018
Now, listen. If I ever catch you anywhere near my house ever again,

882
00:44:50,103 --> 00:44:52,389

I don't know, go out or something?

We can go to 7-Eleven and get pizza sticks.

Well, I guess I didn't think about it long enough.

It was so easy for him, too. I can't stand that.

- For real? Why? - Why do you think?

912
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:55,802
Unreal. You hire a guy to do a job on one day,

00:46:55,896 --> 00:47:00,981
and he comes back the next day, drops it in your wife again for free.

Okay? So, I want you to listen to me.

Well, I...

1109
00:58:48,608 --> 00:58:51,690
Did he get all the leaves? 'Cause it doesn't look really clean.

of a ball-less, neutered, he-she freak.

1186
01:03:00,402 --> 01:03:04,815
But Step? He's got one ball, barely.

1187
01:03:04,905 --> 01:03:11,367
To a jury he's still a man, and that manhood is hanging on by a thread.

1188
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:15,079
I'm telling you, this guy is a Powerball jackpot.

1189
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:16,496
The fucking...

1190
01:03:17,710 --> 01:03:20,043
Hello. I'm Joe Adler.

1191
01:03:21,172 --> 01:03:23,458
- Hi, Joe. Brian. This is Joel. - Nice to see you.

1192
01:03:23,550 --> 01:03:24,539
- How are you? - Hi.

1193
01:03:24,717 --> 01:03:25,833
You see those guys up there?

1194
01:03:25,927 --> 01:03:28,088
I heard those are the guys from General Mills.

1195
01:03:28,179 --> 01:03:31,045
Look, if they're gonna sell this place and cash out and leave me with no job,

1196
01:03:31,141 --> 01:03:32,847
then I should get some of that cash, man.

1197
01:03:32,934 --> 01:03:34,048
I mean, it's only fair.

1198
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:36,099
I've been working here for, like, two years.

1199
01:03:36,186 --> 01:03:38,768
It's bullshit, man. I work my ass off.

1200
01:03:38,856 --> 01:03:41,143
Remember, Hector, I was telling you how hard I worked my ass off?

1201
01:03:41,233 --> 01:03:45,273
I've been working here 14 years. We can get jobs at GemCo like that.

1202
01:03:45,362 --> 01:03:47,648
And at GemCo, all the employees are owners.

1203
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:49,481
It even says so on the nametags.

1204
01:03:49,576 --> 01:03:51,440
But the thing is, I don't want to work at GemCo.

1205
01:03:51,536 --> 01:03:53,025
GemCo sucks, man.

1206
01:03:53,121 --> 01:03:55,202
They make you do calisthenics. Yeah.

1207
01:03:55,289 --> 01:03:58,157
That's right. We could work at Southwest Airlines.

1208
01:03:58,251 --> 01:04:00,115
But I don't want to work at Southwest, either.

1209
01:04:00,210 --> 01:04:02,076
They make you do the limbo.

1210
01:04:02,172 --> 01:04:03,503
That is messed up.

1211
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:06,172
Yeah, I would be the laughingstock of the grindcore community.

1212
01:04:06,259 --> 01:04:08,123
If we quit, this place couldn't run.

1213
01:04:08,219 --> 01:04:10,675
They wouldn't be able to sell this place for anything.

1214
01:04:10,764 --> 01:04:15,177
Well, that's why what we should do is, is we should all go on strike,

1215
01:04:15,268 --> 01:04:18,510
demand stock in the company before it sells.

1216
01:04:18,938 --> 01:04:20,643
If General Mills knew that we were on strike,

1217
01:04:20,731 --> 01:04:23,940
they would not buy this place until that strike was over.

1218
01:04:24,568 --> 01:04:28,152
See, that way, Joel and Brian would have to give us stock.

1219
01:04:30,324 --> 01:04:33,362
Yeah. We should do it. We should strike.

1220
01:04:33,452 --> 01:04:35,443
That's what I've been saying this whole time.

1221
01:04:36,623 --> 01:04:38,204
We've gone through everything,

1222
01:04:38,291 --> 01:04:41,704
and the only way we would even consider a settlement

1223
01:04:41,795 --> 01:04:45,036
would be to the tune of the number you see on the bottom of Page 18.

1224
01:04:45,130 --> 01:04:46,746
Does everyone have this?

1225
01:04:50,677 --> 01:04:51,713
What?

1226
01:04:51,804 --> 01:04:53,887
We don't have this kind of money, not even close.

1227
01:04:53,972 --> 01:04:56,134
Not in cash, you don't. Of course not.

1228
01:04:56,643 --> 01:05:00,226
But if you were to sell off your assets, the property lease, the equipment...

1229
01:05:00,313 --> 01:05:02,724
Are you... Are you shitting me? This would bankrupt us.

1230
01:05:02,815 --> 01:05:04,396
This is what I've been trying to tell you about, Joel.

1231
01:05:04,483 --> 01:05:06,519

1232
01:05:06,610 --> 01:05:08,567

1233
01:05:08,655 --> 01:05:10,646

1235
01:05:14,369 --> 01:05:16,324
In fact, I'll make a deal with you.

1243
01:05:41,688 --> 01:05:44,679
Yep. Those are definitely the guys from General Mills.

1244
01:05:45,150 --> 01:05:48,563
Now, you see that? That is a negotiation going on right there.

1245
01:05:48,652 --> 01:05:51,110

that you guys are doing this deal with General Mills,

1274
01:07:26,083 --> 01:07:31,123
and we just think that... Well, we were considering the idea...

1275
01:07:31,213 --> 01:07:34,206
We think that maybe we should get a piece of it.

1276

1349
01:11:52,891 --> 01:11:53,971
Come in, Sorry.

1350
01:11:54,060 --> 01:11:57,518
Do you want something to drink? I have soda.

1351
01:11:57,896 --> 01:11:59,056
No, thanks.

1352
01:11:59,774 --> 01:12:02,560
Listen, I am so sorry about what happened with Willie.

1353
01:12:02,652 --> 01:12:05,734
He gets crazy. That's why I had to move out,

1354
01:12:05,822 --> 01:12:08,188
so, have a seat.

1355
01:12:11,077 --> 01:12:13,363
- That's Mary's purse, right? - Huh?

1356
01:12:13,453 --> 01:12:16,069
Right there. That's Mary's purse, right?

1357
01:12:16,164 --> 01:12:21,784
Uh, no, that's my bag. So, wait. How are things at work? How is everybody?

1358
01:12:26,551 --> 01:12:31,386
This is Mary's purse, and you stole it.

1359
01:12:31,847 --> 01:12:33,007
Am I right?

1360
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:38,059
Joel, that's my bag. It probably just looks like hers.

1361
01:12:38,604 --> 01:12:40,344
You know, there's a lot of them out there.

1362
01:12:40,439 --> 01:12:42,270
I have never seen another one.

1363
01:12:43,275 --> 01:12:45,813
Or another teddy in a fucking tutu.

1364
01:12:48,738 --> 01:12:52,481
- Now, what are you doing wth Step? - Huh?

1365
01:12:52,577 --> 01:12:54,943
You're the only reason that he's suing this company, right?

1366
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:58,871
Do you have any idea how much work I put into building up that company?

1367
01:12:58,957 --> 01:13:01,073
Do you have any clue? Do you care?

1368
01:13:02,587 --> 01:13:04,452
I'm gonna go. I'm gonna take this.

1369
01:13:04,546 --> 01:13:06,162
If it realy is your bag, you can call the police,

1370
01:13:06,256 --> 01:13:08,338
you can tell them that I stole it. All right?

1371
01:13:09,635 --> 01:13:11,216
On second thought, I'm gonna call them right now

1372
01:13:11,304 --> 01:13:13,295
and I'm gonna tell them that you stole it.

1373
01:13:16,141 --> 01:13:18,804
- Joel, please don't. - Why?

1374
01:13:19,395 --> 01:13:21,726
Joel, please don't call the police. I'm on probation,

1375
01:13:21,814 --> 01:13:24,055
and I will go to jail for a really long time.

1376
01:13:24,149 --> 01:13:25,229
Well, maybe you should have thought about that

1377
01:13:25,318 --> 01:13:27,104
before you started ripping off my employees.

1378
01:13:27,194 --> 01:13:29,525
Joel, please? Listen, I promise you

1379
01:13:29,613 --> 01:13:31,820
I will leave Step alone and he will drop the lawsuit.

1380
01:13:31,908 --> 01:13:33,238
How do I know that?

1381
01:13:34,034 --> 01:13:35,444
You can keep the bag.

1382
01:13:35,536 --> 01:13:38,743
If I don't leave Step alone, if he doesn't drop the lawsuit,

1383
01:13:38,831 --> 01:13:40,662
then you can turn me in.

1384
01:13:45,003 --> 01:13:48,417
Yeah, that... And Sylvia's wallet and Jim's watch?

1385
01:13:48,506 --> 01:13:50,417
You got those? Can I have those, too?

1386
01:13:55,389 --> 01:13:59,552
I guess that works. I mean, great.

1387
01:14:01,479 --> 01:14:04,060
I bet you weren't even into food flavoring, were you?

1388

Mmm-mmm.

Well, I'm sorry. You know, I just... You know, I just...

1399
01:14:40,976 --> 01:14:43,810
I was just curious about how somebody ends up like this.

1400

Joel hasn't been in all morning. Can you believe that?

1410
01:16:12,193 --> 01:16:14,274
If we come in late, we get in trouble.

1411
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:15,440
Mmm-hmm.

1413
01:16:18,615 --> 01:16:21,073
And Hector didn't steal it. Cindy did.

Can you believe that?

1415
01:16:25,372 --> 01:16:28,613
Blaming Cindy just to protect Hector. Typical.

1416
01:16:34,798 --> 01:16:37,791
We really do need to go to the grocery store, Step.

1417
01:16:41,055 --> 01:16:42,716
You heard from Cindy lately?

1418
01:16:42,806 --> 01:16:45,798
It's been over three days since she borrowed your truck.

1419
01:16:46,644 --> 01:16:48,555
Maybe we ought to call the cops or something...

1420
01:16:48,645 --> 01:16:52,389
Look, she'll be back, all right? She wouldn't steal my truck.

1421
01:16:52,483 --> 01:16:53,597
Okay.

1422
01:16:57,695 --> 01:16:59,936
That's the last bottle of Pepsi.

1423
01:17:00,032 --> 01:17:03,865
Maybe I'll just call Domino's and have them deliver some Pepsi.

1424
01:17:06,204 --> 01:17:09,447
Still, if she didn t steal your truck

Is he? Great. Bring him in.

1432
01:17:32,730 --> 01:17:34,686
He's outside at the loading dock.

He wants to talk to you alone out there for some reason. You know?

Truth is, I just want my old life back. I just wanna get back to work.

You know? I'm a working man. That's what I do.

1438
01:17:58,006 --> 01:18:01,498
The problem is, if I bankrupt the company,

1439
01:18:02,427 --> 01:18:04,760
there won't be a job for me to go back to.

1440
01:18:05,639 --> 01:18:07,755
You don't have to bankrupt the company.

1441
01:18:08,434 --> 01:18:11,516
Well, if I drop the lawsuit, you'll sell the company,

1442
01:18:11,604 --> 01:18:16,189
and the new company, well, who'd want to hire somebody with one ball?

1443
01:18:16,609 --> 01:18:22,104
Well, you know, listen, I don't think they're actually allowed to ask,

1444
01:18:22,198 --> 01:18:23,734
so you're okay.

1445
01:18:26,076 --> 01:18:28,192
You know, I'm a working man, too, Step. You know?

1446
01:18:28,287 --> 01:18:32,576
I make extract. That's what I do. You know? Vanilla.

1447
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:37,452
Cherry. Root beer. S'mores.

1448
01:18:38,255 --> 01:18:40,712
And a lot of people don't think that that's very cool,

1449
01:18:40,798 --> 01:18:43,962
but I think that it is pretty cool, so,

1450
01:18:45,637 --> 01:18:47,798
why would I want to sell this place?

1451
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:52,805
I think that I just got distracted with Dean and the drugs

1452
01:18:52,895 --> 01:18:55,681
and the gigolos and...

1453
01:18:59,150 --> 01:19:02,314
You know, what I'm saying is that I'm thinking about maybe

1454
01:19:02,404 --> 01:19:04,144
not selling the company.

1455
01:19:04,989 --> 01:19:07,402
That is, if there isn't a lawsuit.

1456
01:19:08,243 --> 01:19:10,326
There is going to be that insurance money, Step,

1457

01:19:12,997 --> 01:19:14,658

01:22:41,873 --> 01:22:44,489
- Really? - Maybe it was my fault, you know?

1517
01:22:44,585 --> 01:22:46,324
- Maybe it was your fault. - No, it's yours.

1518
01:22:46,420 --> 01:22:48,502
A lot of blame to go around here.

1519
01:22:48,588 --> 01:22:52,922
I think there are some people who just aren't meant to do drugs, Joel.

1520
01:22:54,051 --> 01:22:56,167
I think you're one of those people, man.

1521
01:23:03,103 --> 01:23:04,262
Hello?

1522
01:23:04,979 --> 01:23:06,095
Shit.

1523
01:23:08,442 --> 01:23:10,899
Why are you cleaning the pool yourself?

1524
01:23:10,985 --> 01:23:12,692
New guy didn't work out?

1525
01:23:12,779 --> 01:23:14,564
Yeah, no, didn't work out.

1526
01:23:15,740 --> 01:23:18,231
Boy, it's just hard to get good help, huh?

1527
01:23:18,327 --> 01:23:19,442
Yeah.

1528
01:23:20,162 --> 01:23:21,572
(CHUCKLES)

1529
01:23:22,372 --> 01:23:25,408
Hey. Did you get a chance to write that check?

1530
01:23:26,835 --> 01:23:30,167
Nathan, Joel and I are not going to that dinner. Okay?

1531
01:23:31,215 --> 01:23:34,127
Gee, I wish you would have told me that before I went and bought those tickets.

1532
01:23:34,217 --> 01:23:36,755
Joel never agreed to it, and neither did I.

1533
01:23:38,262 --> 01:23:41,050
Well, it sure sounded like you guys were coming.

1534
01:23:41,140 --> 01:23:43,176
I mean, Leslie was going to talk to you about it,

1535
01:23:43,268 --> 01:23:45,099
but you don't return our calls.

1536
01:23:45,729 --> 01:23:49,016
I mean, I already bought those tickets, and they're non-refundable.

1537
01:23:49,942 --> 01:23:52,854
I really wish you guys had been a little more clear with me.

1538
01:23:54,947 --> 01:23:57,233
Wel, then, let me be clear with you now.

1539
01:23:58,074 --> 01:24:01,738
When we say things like, "I don't think so,"

1540
01:24:01,828 --> 01:24:03,533
or "I'm not sure,"

1541
01:24:03,622 --> 01:24:08,207
or we close the door in your face, that means, "No."

1542
01:24:08,292 --> 01:24:09,783
Why can't you get that?

1543
01:24:10,337 --> 01:24:12,372
- Well, it... - Shut up! Okay.

1544
01:24:12,463 --> 01:24:16,002
Let me be even more clear with you, Nathan.

1545
01:24:16,092 --> 01:24:18,128
We don't like you.

1546
01:24:18,595 --> 01:24:20,631
Is that clear enough for you?

1547
01:24:20,721 --> 01:24:24,430
You're dull. You talk too much. You never listen.

1548
01:24:24,518 --> 01:24:26,054
You're always in our yard.

1549
01:24:26,144 --> 01:24:28,555
I don't know what the hell you're barbecuing over there,

1550
01:24:28,646 --> 01:24:30,182
but it stinks.

1551
01:24:30,274 --> 01:24:34,016
You lay out in your front yard and listen to your car radio!

1552
01:24:34,110 --> 01:24:37,399
You are the worst neighbor in the world.

1553
01:24:37,488 --> 01:24:41,152
We don't like you. Is that clear enough for you, Nathan? Is that clear?

1554
01:24:41,243 --> 01:24:42,528
Shut up!

1555
01:24:42,828 --> 01:24:44,068
Nathan?

1556
01:24:45,079 --> 01:24:47,492
Nathan? Nathan?

1557
01:24:48,457 --> 01:24:50,323
(CHURCH ORGAN PLAYING)

1558
01:25:14,359 --> 01:25:15,895
(CHATTERING)

1559
01:25:19,864 --> 01:25:21,195
- Hi. - Hi.

1560
01:25:23,702 --> 01:25:25,033
Are you okay?

1561
01:25:27,538 --> 01:25:29,951
I think I might have killed him, Joel.

1562
01:25:30,042 --> 01:25:33,125
The last thing he heard was me yelling at him to shut up.

1563
01:25:33,211 --> 01:25:35,997
Well, he did talk a lot.

1564
01:25:36,088 --> 01:25:40,127
Yeah. He was going on and on. I finally lost it.

1565
01:25:40,217 --> 01:25:43,255
I'm sure it wasn't your fault. Probably just a coincidence, you know.

1566
01:25:43,346 --> 01:25:46,054
I don't know. I just... I still feel really guilty about it.

1567
01:25:46,350 --> 01:25:50,719
I actually told Leslie I would go to that Rotary Club dinner tonight.

1568
01:25:51,729 --> 01:25:54,095
She said Nathan would have wanted it that way.

1569
01:25:54,190 --> 01:25:55,896
I said I'd go to that, too.

1570
01:25:56,609 --> 01:25:57,689
Oh.

1571
01:26:02,073 --> 01:26:05,612
So, who was this woman that you wanted to have the affair with, anyway?

1572
01:26:05,702 --> 01:26:09,489
She was just some criminal drifter.

1573
01:26:12,458 --> 01:26:13,493
It wasn't that great.

1574
01:26:13,585 --> 01:26:16,872
You know, I thought that she was really into food flavoring and...

1575
01:26:16,962 --> 01:26:18,498
- Really? - Yeah, I should have known better.

1576
01:26:18,590 --> 01:26:20,251
Nobody's into food flavoring.

1577
01:26:21,134 --> 01:26:23,546
Well, I don't know. I mean, you guys sell a lot of that stuff.

1578
01:26:23,636 --> 01:26:25,172
People are into it.

1579
01:26:31,560 --> 01:26:33,346
You should know, by the way,

1580
01:26:34,439 --> 01:26:35,929
I hired Brad.

1581
01:26:36,942 --> 01:26:39,684
Yeah, I know. You told me that, remember? The whole...

1582
01:26:39,778 --> 01:26:43,362
No, sorry, not for the sex thing or the pool.

1583
01:26:43,698 --> 01:26:45,939
I mean that I hired him for the factory.

1584
01:26:46,618 --> 01:26:48,949
Why? He's a total moron.

1585
01:26:49,037 --> 01:26:51,698
Yeah, I know. This is going to sound kind of weird,

1586
01:26:51,789 --> 01:26:54,497
but I felt sorry for him.

1587
01:26:55,418 --> 01:26:57,283
Yeah. So did I.

1588
01:27:00,631 --> 01:27:03,088
Well, my car's over here, so,

1589
01:27:03,969 --> 01:27:06,961
I guess I'll see you at the Rotary Club?

1590
01:27:08,890 --> 01:27:10,426
Yeah, I'll see you there.

1591
01:27:14,813 --> 01:27:16,052
Suzie?

1592
01:27:17,399 --> 01:27:19,390
Should we maybe just take one car?

1593
01:27:20,569 --> 01:27:22,434
Yeah. We probably should.

1594
01:27:23,238 --> 01:27:24,398
Yeah.

1595
01:27:26,699 --> 01:27:29,817
I thought that was a surprisingly tasteful funeral.

1596
01:27:29,911 --> 01:27:33,994
JOEL: Yes, it was. You know, when I was looking down on him, I thought,

1597
01:27:34,498 --> 01:27:37,787
"This might be the longest I've ever seen him with his mouth shut."

1598
01:27:37,877 --> 01:27:40,335
SUZIE: Yeah. I didn't expect that many mourners.

1599
01:27:40,796 --> 01:27:42,502
There were a lot of people there.

1600
01:27:42,591 --> 01:27:43,626
JOEL: Yeah.

1601
01:27:46,595 --> 01:27:50,804
<i>(SINGING) You have been</i> <i>a friend of mine, rainy day woman</i>

1608

Where the hell is she?

1609
01:28:14,538 --> 01:28:17,747
How long does it take to get some goddamned cigarettes around here?
