00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,400
I love you.

2
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,100
You do?

3
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,200

4
00:00:55,300 --> 00:01:01,100
Well good. I love you too.

5
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,100
But then you've known that for a
few hours now.

6
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,800
I've never been here before.
This is great.

7
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,300
Yeah, isn't it?

8
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,700
Winter picnic.

9
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,600
Yeah. There's cheese and
 crackers there if you want.

10
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:25,700
Awesome. This is so great.
 Thank you so much.

11
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,400
No, thank you's aren't
necessary. Should we toast?

12
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:36,900
Um, do you mind if I toast?

13
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,700
Love it if you toasted.

14
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,300
There's some things I want to
 get off my chest.

15
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:48,900
To the greatest person I've ever
met?

16
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,300
Wow, that sounded stupid.

17
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:58,300
Well the sentiment still stands.
I think you're great, and I am
very glad that we meet.

18
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,100
These past couple weeks have
been -

19
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,600
Three weeks.

20
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:09,700
Three weeks. Yeah. It's just
been great getting to know you.

21
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,100
You too.

22
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,800
And... I love you.

23
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:28,600
You don't have to say anything
back.

24
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,500
Okay.

25
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:37,300
Okay...

26
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,900
Cheers.

27
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,200
Cheers.

28
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,200
Is this a good wine?

29
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,000
It is, actually.

30
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,200
Yeah you can tell.

31
00:02:51,300 --> 00:03:07,700
**

32
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,700
Are you watching this?

33
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,600
Why?

34
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:48,100
You're the one that - you wanted
- you're the one that wanted to
 watch this.

35
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,400
I know

36
00:04:50,500 --> 00:05:00,900
It's interesting! I mean imagine
what would the Bronx be like if
they didn't -

37
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,600
God! Ow!

38
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,300
That didn't hurt, you liar.

39
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:15,000
It was your idea, what do you,
 what do you want?

40
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:18,500
Well, I have a lot of ideas.

41
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,700
No.

42
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:26,000
How can you say no?

43
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,500
I don't know. I'm not in the
mood.

44
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,600
It's fine.

45
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,300
No I kind of in the mood now.
 I'm kind of in the mood.

46
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,600
Well, that's great.

47
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:39,400
Why are you being cross?

48
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,300
I'm not being cross.
I'm watching the show.

49
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:49,200
You know. You know what I mean.
Would you be interested in some
other things?

50
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,400
Maybe.

51
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:56,600
Let's see if we can get you
there.

52
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:02,800
Well I'm not just a switch that
you can turn on and off. Okay?

53
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm a human and I have feelings.

54
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:13,600
**

55
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,800
Thanks pal.

56

You too man.

58
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:34,500
**

59
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,300
Is anybody sitting here?

60
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,400
No.

61
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,700
You ever heard of this brand of
 ginger ale?

62
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,900
No I haven't.

63
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,800
Probably costs two dollars for a
 case of it.

64
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,500
Exactly.

65
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,000
Well it tastes fine.

66
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,400
I'm Peter.

67
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,100
Hi Peter.

68
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,500
But uh, just one last note on
 this guy.

69
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,700
You know how he does a little
salad on the side of the chicken

70
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,400
and the rice like you have
there?

71
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,700
Yeah?

72
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:52,700
Well I started, he'll, you can
get instead of the fried rice,

73
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,400
he'll put a bed of salad with
 the chicken on top for ya.

74
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,800
So you get a salad with grilled
 chicken for $3.50.

75
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,400
That's Good to know.

76
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,100
Yeah, yeah.

77
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,800
I mean you can continue to eat
 the, all that fried stuff,

78
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:19,000
but, if you're interested in
something a little more healthy,
less fattening,

79
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,200
uh, he'll uh, he'll make it for
 just salad for ya.

80
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,700
How come you're having it with
rice?

81
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,700
I'm in training.
So I'm carboloading.

82
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,300
Well what are you in training
for?

83
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,800
Uh a rice eating competition.

84
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,300
Good luck.

85
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:48,600
No, I'm just in a hungry man
kind of a mood today.

86
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:53,200
Like one of those lumberjacks
from the frozen dinner
commercials?

87
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:59,400
Yeah. I see you're the same way.

**

121
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:32,000
Um, maybe you should go back to
your apartment.

122
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,300
Yeah. Yeah. I think.

123
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,200
I think I'm not ready for you to
 stay here.

124
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,400
Okay, yeah.

125
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:43,400
Do you want me to set up the
couch?

126
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,800
Do you want to do that?

127
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,900
Uh, this is stupid.

128
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,900
No I mean I can, I can take a
cab.

129
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,300
Okay.

130
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,800
Well no, do you mind if I stay
on the couch?

131
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,400
I think that maybe it could be a
 good idea.

132
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,100
Okay. Yeah, you're right.

133
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,200
I'm starving. You hungry?

134
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,300
Little bit.

135
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:27,300
Hey. Let's go to new Vietnamese
place we keep saying we're going
to try.

136
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,700
Uh...

00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,500
You said you wanted to go.

138
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,700
I don't really feel like putting
 my shoes on and everything.

139
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:40,200
Okay.

140
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:43,300

00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:47,200
I'm not that hungry why don't
you uh look go look through the
 menus and choose.

142
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,100
You feel like Chinese?

143
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,000
Whatever. You choose.

144
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,000
I don't even know if I want
 Chinese.

145
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,300
Have we ordered form this Thai
place?

146
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:11,700
Yeah. That's the one where you
said the Pad Thai tasted like
Vagina.

147
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:18,900
That wasn't this place. And I
 didn't say it tasted like
Vagina.

148
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,800
I said this Pad That tastes like
"Poon Thai."

149
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,400
Pick a place Peter.

150
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:29,900
Fuck it! Chinese.
Chinese good with you?

151
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,100
Fine.

152
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,000
Well what would you rather have?

153
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:35,200
I just said Chinese was fine.

154
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:42,900
Alright. So we'll get Sesame
chicken white meat only, and,
 um, do you want Lo Mein?

155
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,500
Anything.

156
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:48,000
It's too much starch. You want a
shrimp dish?

157
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,900
Peter. Whatever.

158
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,900
Well you're not helping me.

159
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,400
Just pick two dishes.

160
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:56,700
Fine. I'll get the eggplant.
Like I wanted.

161
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,100
Fine.

162
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:03,800
I'll just have some of the
 chicken.

163
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:12,800
Well I'm not going to order a
 whole eggplant for myself.

164
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,200
Get it, you can have left over's
 tomorrow.

165
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:18,500
Eggplant sucks the next day.
 It's not even that good the
 first day.

166
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:24,500
Fuck it. Let's go to the
 Vietnamese place.

167
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,200

Come on. I'm going to kill you.

171
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,900

Oh remind me to pick up some oil
soap on the way home.

173
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:00,600
Are we breaking in a new
baseball glove?

174
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,800
No. I'm breaking in a new purse.

175
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:06,700
What? Are you - really?

176
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,800
Yeah. Sometimes you want them
 to look not so new.

177
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:12,600
That's so cool. Do you put it
under your mattress?

178
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,800
What?

179
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:17,400
Well that's what you do with
 baseball gloves.

180
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,700
Thank you very much.

181
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,100
Do you tie it up with string or?

182
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,000
That's what you do with a
baseball glove?

183
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:28,900
Yes, you tie it up with string
and put a baseball inside and
 you rub it down.

184
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,600
You don't, you don't put a
 baseball inside?

185
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:40,000
Are you okay?

186
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:45,100
Just had a little aftertaste of
vagina.

187
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:51,000
Sorry. Here try it.

188
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,500
Try it?

189
00:15:53,600 --> 00:16:01,300
Come on. Just smell it then.
 Just experiment, loosen up.

190
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,000
No I don't want your "Poon
Thai."

191
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,300
Okay. Ew it got on me.

192
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:11,700
Exactly. This Pad Thai tastes
 like "Poon Thai."

193
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,900
Can I have some of yours?

194
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,300
You're going to keep eating it?

195
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,000
Hey

196
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,400
Hey what's up man.

197
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,200
Keith

198
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,900
No no, hey Keith.

199
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,200
You had that look on your face
like maybe you didn't remember
 my name.

200
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,500
No no no, not at all.

201
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,800
Vandy's brotherinlaw.

202
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,000
Right, right. He really does
 look like that guy.

203
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:47,800
I know.

204
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,400
So uh you've met my wife Emma.

205
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,000
Hi I remember Emma also.

206
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,000
How are you Emma? How's Delia

207
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,500
I'm good how are you? She's
great she's over at the kid's
table having a blast.

208
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,400
You know I don't believe that
we're not at the same table.

209
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,300
I know.

210
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,200
I think it's crap.

211
00:16:59,300 --> 00:16:59,900
It is.

212
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,400
It's ridiculous.

213
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,000
I know you guys never get a
chance to talk, it's bullshit.

214
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,300
Yeah, you know you're still on
my shit list. You don't get to
joke with me.

215
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,300
Okay well we're going to go
dance because Emma took some
 dancing lessons.

216
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,600
Stripper!

217
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,900
Love them. How long have they
been married?

218
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,400
Eight years. You guys get
 reminded of your wedding at
these?

219
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,200
Not really.

220
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,300
It was so romantic she blocked
it out.

221
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,700
Yeah.

222
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:31,000
What's wrong with you? He was
there the day we were betrothed?

223
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,300
I was.

224
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,600
You use that word every chance
 you get.

225
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,900
Betrothed?

226
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Yes.

227
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,300
Betrothed?

228
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,300
Yes.

229
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,000
Betrothed?

230
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:45,800
Yes. I get your joke Paul,
 you're very funny.

231
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,800
I'm getting another cocktail
 does anybody want anything?

232
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,700
I'll have a beer.

233
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,600
I'll have one too.

234
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,600
Honey?

235
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,700
I'm good.

236
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,300
Do you have any singles?

237
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,600
What do you want it for?

238
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,400
Nothing.

239
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:00,800
Honey, this is a formal event.
 You don't have to tip the
 bartender.

240
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,900
Bartender didn't have a problem
 with it.

241
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,900
It's not done.

242
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,800
Of course it's done I've done
 it.

243
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,100
I don't want to argue about this
 with you.

244
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,500
I'm asking you nicely.

245
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,300
And I appreciate that. But this
 isn't one of your cousin's
 weddings.

246
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,900
You don't tip the bartender.

247
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,500
Okay. You gonna give me the
singles or not?

248
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,000
Absolutely not. Look I
understand that you think you're
being a good person,

249
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,900
and you are, but it's
embarrassing and I don't want
you doing it.

250
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,800
Are you like my keeper now?

251
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:34,200
Listen. I'm not going to open
my purse and support something I
 don't believe in.

252
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:37,700
Do you understand that? Now if
you want to go get singles and
 give them to the bartender

253
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:42,300
and embarrass yourself, fine.
But I'm not going to help you
 make an ass of yourself.

254
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,700
Fine! I forgot, what kind of
beer you want?

255
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:51,400
Uh, Stella would be fine.

256
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,700
Oh yeah.

257
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:59,200
I mean, unbelievable.

258
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:03,300
Is it me? Is it me? Just tell
me if I'm wrong, tell me if I'm
wrong.

259
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:09,400
Yeah. No. They're, uh, I mean
 I've seen like a few people
 doing it but, no.

260
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:15,100
Right. He expects me to just -
Jesus - he's over there asking -

261
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:20,900
What was that?

262
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,800
I don't know.
It's awesome though.

263
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:28,600
Don't say that we're like that.

264
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:32,100
We're not. We are not like that
at all.

265
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,100
What are you doing in my closet?

266
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,400
Nothing.

267
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:17,900
Oh. Here we go. You should
wear this one.

268
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,400
Good one.

269
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,800
What?

270
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,500
Shut up Vandy.

271
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,600
You shut up. I'm serious, you
should wear this one.

272
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:32,100
It would look really nice with
the gray suit.

273
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:36,300
Are you fucking kidding me?

274
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,200
No I think you should wear it.

275
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:42,400
Okay. I'm serious, go back to
bed.

276
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:50,000
What's the matter. Poopy
doesn't want to wear a purple
shirt?

277
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:56,600
Poopy afraid he won't be a real
man if he's wearing a purple.

278
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,500
Poopy doesn't want to be touched
okay?

279
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,500
Don't get all tense already.

280
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,200
I'm not tense.

281
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:08,200
Stop acting like such an
 asshole.

282
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:15,400
Why don't you go back to bed?
It's early you don't need to be
up yet.

283
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,700
So you feel good?

284
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,900
What?

285
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,900
I mean do you feel like
 yourself?

286
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,200
What are you talking about?

287
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:37,500
Well you said before you don't
do well in interviews,

288
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:42,100
that you go into a trance or
something, and you never end up
acting like yourself.

289
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:48,600
So are you feeling like
 yourself?

290
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,600
Yeah. I'm feeling like myself.

291
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:56,900
Good. You're gonna be fine.

292
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,800
This tie is shorter than normal
ones.

293
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,100
Want me to do it?

294
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:08,900
So. Do you have things you know
you want to talk about?

295
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,700
Or are you just going there and
wing it? Or.

296
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:17,600
No I just answer the questions.

297
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:20,600
Oh.

298
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,500
Why?

299
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:32,400
Just wondering.

300
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,200
Are you okay?

301
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:37,400
Just can't believe this is
 happening again.

302
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,100
What's the matter?

303
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,600
Nothing.

304
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:42,800
What?

305
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:49,300
I. I hate interviews. I suck
 at them.

306
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,600
I go in there and I apologize
 for myself

307
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:56,400
and I just didn't think it was
 going to happen this time.

308
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,800
I thought I was done being a
jerkoff. Fuck!

309
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:15,000
Hey now, come here. Oh my baby.
Angel. You're gonna be great.

310
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:25,600
I'm just so tense.

311
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:32,200
Would you like for me to help
 you relax?

312
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,900
What do you mean?

313
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:51,200
Just sit back. Let me do the
 work. Hey. Who's the best
 interviewer in the world?

314
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:55,000
I am.

315
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,600
That's right.

316
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,300
Thank you for saying that.

317
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,700
You mean the toast?

318
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,300
Yeah. No, I meant the wine.

319
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,800
Oh. Yeah I figured you meant the
toast but maybe you spent a lot
 of time picking the wine.

320
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:37,000
No I got the wine from my dad I
- I meant the toast.

321
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:40,900
Thank you.

322
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,800
You're welcome? I'm sorry If I

323
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:56,400
Don't. Can I ask you something?

324
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,100
Course

325
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,700
Because we said we were going to
 be honest with each other.

326
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,900
Right.

327
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,400
What are you thinking about?

328
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:11,000
Right now?

329
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:14,900
Or just a few seconds ago.

330
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Um, I'm not sure what I was
 thinking a few seconds ago.

331
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:39,000
Um, as for now, honestly, I'm
 angry that you would ask me
that.

332
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:45,900
I feel like shit.
What else would I be feeling?

333
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,900
I'm sorry.

334
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,200
It's okay.

335
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,900
I was just trying to be close.

336
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
It's fine.

337
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,400
I don't know why I asked.

338
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:00,500
It's okay, it's okay.

339
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:09,200
I like the way you do things.
 A lot. So.

340
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,300
I love you.

341
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,600
You do?

342
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,700
I do.

343
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:27,100
Well good.

344
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,300
Oh my god.

345
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,100
Hello Vandy.

346
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,600
Hi.

347
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:14,100
So.

348
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,300
What'cha doing?

349
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,000
I was just about to ask you.

350
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,300
Christmas shopping.

351
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,000
Right I saw the bags, I should
 have put the two together.

352
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:26,200
I'm actually heading over to
 that golf store.

353
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:31,600
I'm gong on a trip with uh Gary
and Paul. Going to Arizona.

354
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:34,700
Sure they're glad to have you
around.

355
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:41,100
Actually to do remember that
thing I read you about how you
 play golf during the day,

356
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:47,500
uh, and you bet on all the holes
an that night you play poker
 with the winnings?

357
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,400
Vaguely.

358
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:59,300
Yeah well, play poker uh with
the winnings until someone goes
bust. Should be fun.

359
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,200
It sounds like fun.

360
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:06,600
Um, I should get going I have a
thousand things to do.

361
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:09,000
Emma and I are gong to the
 Caribbean after Christmas.

362
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,800
That's great! Where?

363
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:14,400
St. Thomas. It's her idea and
 she got me the ticket and
 everything

364
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:17,400
and so I want to get her
something so I was going to go
to that place,

365
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:22,000
that jewelry store that's near
our apartment - my apartment,
and um

366
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:25,600
Yeah that's a nice place uh,
it's expensive.

367
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:29,200
Yeah but I can have that jeweler
we know remake if I see
 something.

368
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,100
Yeah that's what I was going to.

369
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,300
So I was going to go do that and
then I was going to go tanning.

370
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,900
That's a good idea.

371
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,600
So I don't get burned in the
 Caribbean.

372
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:42,600
I know. Have you gone yet?

373
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,100
Yeah a week ago.

374
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:50,900
Yeah you look. You have a good
color.

375
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,200
Thanks.

376
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:57,600
So you're going that way?

377
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,200
Yeah um

378
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:02,600
I'm going in the other
direction, I would have walked
 with you.

379
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:03,600
It's okay.

380
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:10,200
So is your family okay?

381
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:14,600

Oh yeah, they're fine.

Have a great Christmas and a fun
 time with the boys.

384
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,100
Say hi to Pail for me.

385
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,900
Okay yeah. Say hi to Emma for
me, she'll love that.

386
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,200
Shut up.

387
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,800
You shut up.

388
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:33,500
I should go.

389
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,400
Okay.

390
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,700
Have a good Christmas.

391
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:40,800
Yeah you too.

392
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:57,100
**

393
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,600
Hey.

394
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,300
Hey.

395
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,300
So.

396
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,100
So.

397
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,900
How'd it go?

398
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,800
Fine.

399
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:37,800
That's it? How did it go?

400
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:40,700
It went fine.

401
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,000
Did they give you any
 indication?

402
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:48,700
They thanked me and said they'd
be in touch. It went well, I
mean.

403
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,800
Good you got the feeling then
 that it went well.

404
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,700
Yeah I just said it went well.

405
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:57,900
Yeah I know it's just you're not
 giving me any specifics.

406
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:04,800
Well I don't know what to tell
you it was an interview. It
went well, I guess, you know.

407
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:09,200
They guy was like 60 years old
so it's not like we, you know

408
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:13,700
it's not like we had friends in
common or something it was an
 interview.

409
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,700
Do you know if he liked you?

410
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,800
I don't know if he liked me.

411
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:21,600
It's not like he was looking for
a new best friend he was looking
 for someone to do the job.

412
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:25,700
Someone who's competent, so,
that's what I was trying to be.

413
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,300
Trying to be?

414
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:30,000
Honestly I don't want to talk
 about it anymore.

415
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:32,800
There's really nothing else to
 say. It went fine. Okay?

416
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:35,800
Okay

417
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:39,700
You hungry? You want me to fix
you a snack?

418
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,700
Sure. I don't see much.

419
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:48,300
There isn't. I could make you a
PB and J. You want me to make
 you one?

420
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,700
I guess so.

421
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:54,100
Okay.

422
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,900
Is that what you call a peanut
 butter and jelly sandwich?

423
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,500
A PB and J?

424
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:10,200
Yup. Why?

425
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,200
Did the mail come?

426
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:16,700
Mmhmm yeah it was just junk.
 And a travel and leisure
 magazine.

427
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,100
Great.

428
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,500
Did they mention what the
 vacation time was?

429
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,900
No.

430
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:34,100
What are you doing?

431
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,400
Don't start with me.

432
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:42,300
I'm just trying to figure out
 what you're doing.

433
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,300
I'm trying to be nice.

434
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:50,300
Are you using two knives to make
 a peanut putter and jelly
 sandwich?

435
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:58,400
Yeah uh, I don't want to get the
peanut butter in the jelly jar.
Okay?

436
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,500
Well -

437
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,000
Don't start with me.

438
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:06,100
Okay.

439
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,900
What is the matter.

440
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,200
I mean you're going to get the
sandwich and it's going to taste
 the same.

441
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,700
What's the problem Peter?

442
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:16,000
There is no problem Vandy.

443
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:18,900
Like it's my fault.

444
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,200
You know what the problem is.

445
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:32,900
The problem is that only a
 fucking moron would use two
 knives to make a PB and J?

446
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,600
Who do you think - give me the
knife.

447
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,400
Peter -

448
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:41,300
I'm not going to kill you Vandy
just give me the knife.

449
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:46,400
Fine I'll use your other one.
 Now watch.

450
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:51,300
First what you do is you spread
the PB, okay.

451
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:57,100
Now you see this excess PB on
the knife? You wipe it on the
other slice of bread. Okay?

452
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,600
See that peanut butter shit
stain?

453
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:02,700
That means the knife is now
clean and ready for the J, okay?

454
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:08,700
Fuckface! Maybe if you shut up
and stopped being such a fucking
 psychopath

455
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,500
you might learn something.

456
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:13,700
You are a fucking asshole!

457
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,300
Oh yeah it's always me being the
 asshole isn't it?

458
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:20,500
Why don't you try taking
 responsibility for your own
stupid shit.

459
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:25,700
I don't like doing it that way!
The knife is never clean enough!

460
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:30,000
Okay, Fuckface! Why don't you go
fuck yourself.

461
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:39,800
This bread is soft. So it will
always make the knife clean!

462
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:45,200
Unless, you're a fucking ape,
 and don't know how to do
 anything.

463
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:54,500
Don't take it out on me because
you choked in your interview.

464
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,300
Hey who said I choked in my
 interview?

465
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:01,100
Please

466
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:09,900
Hey fuck you Vandy! My
interview was fine, I nailed it
okay?

467
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,800
I'm the best interviewer in the
 world, remember?

468
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,100
Good morning.

469
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,400
Good morning.

470
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,500
Did I sleep late?
 What time is it?

471
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,600
No. I mean it's okay,
I just got up.

472
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:56,200
Oh good. Good.
 Oh, you made eggs.

473
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:59,900
Yeah. I mean you were still
 asleep so.

474
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:06,000
No no it's fine, I was just - I
mean I'm glad you made eggs for
yourself. I'm fine.

475
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:21,200
I'm going to go put on some
clothes. Do you mind if I don't
shower.

476
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,600
No of course not.

477
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:39,900
Uh, Vandy? Do you know where
that box is with the sweaters
and the pants that uh,

478
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,200
it was in the bottom of the
closet I never picked it up.

479
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:48,600
Yeah, uh that box isn't around
 anymore.

480
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,300
It's not?

481
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,600
No.

482
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:55,300
Is it somewhere else? Existing?

483
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,800
No.

484
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:03,900
Oh. Okay that, no that's uh,
that's fine.

485
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:10,500
Um, actually do you still have
that sweatshirt that I gave you?

486
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:14,900
Yeah I still have it, it's in
the top dresser drawer.

487
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,800
Right. Okay.

488
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,200
That embarrasses you?
 Me giving him $3?

489
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,600
Yes because you are a
representation of me.

490
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:28,500
I can't believe she said that to
him.

491
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,800
I know.

492
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,700
I would kill you if you talked
 to me like that.

493
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,800
Oh shut up.

494
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:33,800
You shut up.

495
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,400
You talk to me like that all the
time.

496
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,700
Hey I do not! Don't say that.

497
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:42,500
What happened with them is
fucked up. I didn't like that.

498
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:48,800
No you're right. Keith is a
 pretty good dancer.

499
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:54,000
Look at Delia.

500
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,600
Alright who made the gravy?

501
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:07,000
I did. I made the stuffing too,
it's terrific.

502
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:09,000
Hey Deal's sweetie, you want
 some gravy?

503
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,800
No. It's disgusting.

504
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,800
You don't like gravy? It's
 delicious.

505
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:15,400
I don't eat gravy and I don't
 eat Turkey.

506
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,300
Okay, do you want to eat
 stuffing?

507
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,400
I eat stuffing.

508
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,800
Okay. Give her a little
 stuffing.

509
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:23,900
V you don't know how excited I
 am fir this TRIP.

510
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
I think I need it as much as you
 do.

511
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:28,000
Yeah I'll be great.

512
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,300
Careful with the spelling she's
getting GOOD.

513
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:35,800
You know what I would actually
 like to make a toast to the
Patron Saint Thomas,

514
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:39,100
thank you for what we are about
 to receive.

515
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,800
That's very clever I like that.

516
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:44,600
Have you seen Highheeled Shoes
 yet hunny?

517
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,100
No mom.

518
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,400
You should it can be so
 uplifting.

519
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,900
Does anybody want some more
 white meat?

520
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,100
Oh you know I got you an extra
 um turkey thigh too hunny.

521
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,400
Thank you.

522
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,700
You have to keep eating you
know.

523
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,000
Yeah, I know.

524
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:00,100
We have eggplant parm coming so.

525
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:03,400
You know if there's anything
special you liked you just as me
okay?

526
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,200
Mom, give me a break.

527
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:08,900
I think she knows how to eat so.

528
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,900
But I mean it, just anything.
It's what I'm here for.

529
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,700
Just stop it.

530
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:20,500
You know Van your mother says
these things because she cares
 about you.

531
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:29,400
Nice job spitting it into your
 napkin hun.

532
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:32,100
I don't like stuffing either.

533
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,900
What! You loved the stuffing
last year. You remember how
much you ate?

534
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,700
Emma -

535
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,200
Huh? No, do you remember? You
said "I want to eat stuffing all
 the time".

536
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:40,100
Emma

537
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,100
What?

538
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,500
PETER made the stuffing last
year.

539
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:46,700
Did you just spell Peter?

540
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,700
Yes I did, that is very good.

541
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,600
You know there's a Peter in her
 class that's how she knows.

542
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:53,500
That's not how I know I can
read!

543
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,300
No I know, hun.

544
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,800
Is Peter coming today?

545
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,800
Who hunny, the Peter in your
class?

546
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:02,200
No, Vandy's husband.

547
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:05,800
You know what hunny they were
never actually married.

548
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,800
Emma, what are you doing?

549
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:08,700
What!

550
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,600
No hunny he's not.

551
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:11,900
Why?

552
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,300
Because he doesn't realize what
 a commitment is.

553
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,900
Mom.

554
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,300
You know what, he just couldn't
 make it.

555
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:22,700
Will Pete make the stuffing next
year?

556
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,700
You know the more you make
things up the more question's
 you're gonna get.

557
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:31,300
Peter and I aren't friends
 anymore.

558
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,100
Why?

559
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:39,100
You know what, hunny. Peter
wanted to be friends with other
people

560
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,400
while he was friends with Vandy
and you're not really allowed -

561
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,200
Emma - what are you doing?

562
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:44,200
Well -

563
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:45,700
You can have more than one
friend

564
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,200
That's exactly right sweetie.

565
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:49,300
Yeah but Peter wanted to be
friends with this one person,

566
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,800
and he wasn't really allowed to
be friends -

567
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:52,700
Okay that is not why everything
 happened.

568
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,700
Peter just wasn't a very nice
person.

569
00:40:54,800 --> 00:41:00,200
Mom! Honestly! Sorry.

570
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:11,100
Peter was a nice person,
 didn't you think?

571
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,000
Yes.

572
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:16,300
Yeah, he was nice. I don't know
why we're not friends anymore.

573
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,100
He was funny.

574
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:22,600
Yeah he is funny. He's a good
person and he didn't do anything
wrong.

575
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:23,900
Jesus Christ.

576
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,100
Mom.

577
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:38,400
No one did anything wrong.

578
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,400
Hey.

579
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,900
You alright?

580
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,100
Yeah.

581
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:52,600
Nervous? Everyone seems to love
your painter.

582
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:56,300
Yeah I know I sold two more of
her paintings.

583
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:01,500
Wow, that's amazing.
Hey should I buy one?

584
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,400
Do you like them?

585
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:06,600
Uh yeah, yeah.

586
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:11,100
You don't have to buy one.

587
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,600
You sure?

588
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:13,900
Yeah.

589
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,900
Are you happy?

590
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,400
Of course.

591
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:21,900
Well you should be.

592
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:34,800
Do you want to meet my parents?
They're going to be in town next
 weekend.

593
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:38,400
Yeah, I should.

594
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:39,900
I don't want to twist your arm.

595
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,200
No, fine, it's fine. Yeah.

596
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:43,900
We'll go for a dinner.

597
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,600
'Kay. I'll find us a place.
 Where do you want to go?

598
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:49,400
No, no, no, my secretary will
 take care of that.

599
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:53,000
She gets hooked up everywhere so
we are all set.

600
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:55,700
Ooh I am gonna grab a couple of
these.

601
00:42:55,800 --> 00:43:06,600
This is a great night for you.
 Congrats.

602
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:15,000
I think I am going to buy one of
 these pictures. Portraits.

603
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:20,200
I don't want you to buy one of
 these paintings.

604
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:23,000
No I would like to.

605
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:28,300
Okay if you - whatever - if you
see a painting and you like it,
great.

606
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,800
Is that a problem?

607
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:35,200
I don't want you to buy one to
 be nice.

608
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:37,400
Why not?

609
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,900
'Cause that's insulting.

610
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,200
What?

611
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:49,900
Nothing. You know what, you've
got a lot of people you need to
talk to tonight

612
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
so I think that I am gonna go.

613
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:57,500
No Andrew I want to know.
If you're angry you can tell me.

614
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:00,500
I know, I know.

615
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:06,500
No, you know it was my bad. It
was my bad so, uh, this is your
night,

616
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:12,100
you know actually no, it is my
bad, that was my bad.

617
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:21,800
I'll stop by your office
 tomorrow afternoon, okay?
We can get lunch or something.

618
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:23,600
I can't I start jury duty
 tomorrow.

619
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:27,100
That's right.

620
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:27,900
Sorry.

621
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:44,100
**

622
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,900
Hey.

623
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,900
Hey. Uh, Peter.

624
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,200
Yeah. Hello Vandy.

625
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:02,700
How's it going?

626
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,400
Umm, not so bad.

627
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:10,400
Good to hear. Alright well, it
 was good seeing ya.

628
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:12,200
You still on that case?

629
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:13,900
Almost done.

630
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:19,600
Awesome. Listen Vandy, this is
going to sound a little out of
nowhere but uh,

631
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:23,100
Before you say anything I should
tell you I'm dating someone.

632
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:26,800
Okay. I wasn't going to ask you
out on a date.

633
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:28,800
Oh.

634
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:33,300
But you're not that far off
base. I told you this was out of
 nowhere, we only met once,

635
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:36,100
but I have something for you.

636
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,300
Oh?

637
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:44,100
It's not like it's a body part
or something, okay, I'm not a
stalker or a.

638
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:54,200
And I realize that you're dating
someone, that's fine, but you'll
 see it's really nothing.

639
00:45:54,300 --> 00:46:01,800
Here it is. It's the crossword
 puzzle from two days ago.

640
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:06,700
I was doing it and there was
this clue "Southern university
 for short,"

641
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:12,100
and the answer was Vandy. Short
for Vanderbilt.

642
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:17,100
I actually finished that puzzle
and Vandy was one of the last
 ones I filled out

643
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:27,400
and I was like, 'Hey!' And truth
be told you'd run through my
 mind more than a few times

644
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:32,900
since that day I met you and uh,
and then the puzzle so I took a
chance.

645
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:38,800
I thought you said you finished
 it.

646
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:42,700
Yeah. I, well I picked up a new
 one at the deli.

647
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:48,800
That way you can just fill out
Vandy, or the whole thing, or
leave it blank,

648
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:51,900
or crumple it up and put it in
the garbage like you're probably
 going to.

649
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,500
It was just a random thing. I
thought of you when I saw it

650
00:46:56,600 --> 00:47:03,000
and I understand that you're.
 I'm sorry.

651
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:14,300
No there's no need to apologize.
 This is. Thank you.

652
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:24,200
Well uh, I, I should go.

653
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:28,300
No, yeah, yeah of course.

654
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:32,500
Giving up that easily?

655
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:40,100
Do you like Indian food?

656
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:41,700
Yeah.

657
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:45,400
Okay do you know that street
with all the Indian restaurants
on it?

658
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:47,700
Curry Row?

659
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:52,600
Yes. Curry Row. Would you like
to go to one of those places
 with me?

660
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:56,300
Which one?

661
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:14,400
Hi.

662
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,800
Hi.

663
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:18,500
Did you design this?

664
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:23,300
Uh yeah, it was actually my idea
to make the whole thing entirely
out of glass.

665
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,200
Oh cool.

666
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:32,300
No I'm kidding I just make the
models. No I hate those glass
pieces of shit.

667
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:33,500
Really?

668
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:36,100
Yeah. But that's all they make
so, they're everywhere.

669
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:38,700
Yeah, no I can't stand the sight
 of them.

670
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:45,000
I'm Michelle.

671
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:46,800
Hi Michelle.

672
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:51,400
So you really enjoy working
here.

673
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:58,200
I do actually. I'm kidding. No
I'm actually interviewing but
 don't say anything.

674
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:01,700
Oh I won't. I just started
here.

675
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:03,100
Oh yeah?

676
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:07,300
Do you know of any good places
 to eat around here?

677
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,800
I was looking for like a really
good BBQ place.

678
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:14,600
Oh well I don't know of a lot of
really good BBQ places around
here,

679
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:17,700
but there's a great barbeque
place that's not so far away.

680
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:21,800
Are you making fun of me?
 You're lucky you're funny.

681
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:26,300
Thank you I uh, I like making
 people LOL.

682
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,700
Oh my god, whatever.

683
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:36,300
Let me, let me help you with
those.

684
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:37,900
I seriously think I got it.

685
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,300
No no I can take them. I'll just
take them to the files.

686
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,000
I've got it really.

687
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:43,700
Just give me some of the files.

688
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:48,100
Alright, four whiskies.

689
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:55,100
I can't, I gotta go.

690
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,000
Come on!

691
00:49:57,100 --> 00:50:03,200
It's mine an Marissa's
anniversary tomorrow.

692
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:05,400
To Paul and.

693
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:08,300
Marissa, her name is Marissa.

694
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,000
I'm joking, I'm joking.

695
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:11,700
I'm telling her. All that shit
 you said, I'm telling her.

696
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:15,400
Woah, woah, woah, you and
 Marissa are okay, right?

697
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:17,800
Yeah man.

698
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:20,800
Well what we were talking about
 last week.

699
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:22,900
I mea, don't worry about it.

700
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,700
Well I just didn't want to toast
if you guys.

701
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:27,100
We're fine man, don't worry
 about it.

702
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:31,400
Cool, cool. Cheers.

703
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,800
Forget about it.

704
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:47,100
Okay. You guys are not splitting
up. You guys are going to stay
 together.

705
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:51,800
Yes. And could you pretend that
I didn't say anything to you.

706
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:53,000
Yeah. Yes I can.

707
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:54,500
'Cause you know she can.

708
00:50:54,600 --> 00:51:01,000
I do. Good, oh good. I am so
happy. That is fucking awesome.

709
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:02,800
Okay, okay.

710
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:05,500
No I'm serious. When you're
with someone it always comes to
 that point

711
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:08,300
where you just gotta work
 through that stuff.

712
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:11,400
I got it man, I got it, I got
 it. How you doing?

713
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:17,000
I'm a little fucked up.
 I'm sorry I'm acting like a
 douche bag.

714
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:27,400
Keith? Keith. Keith!

715
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:31,100
Is that Keith?

716
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,000
Keith? How are you?

717
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:34,700
I'm sorry, I'm not -

718
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,900
How is everyone? How's Delia?

719
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,500
I don't know what you're talking
about.

720
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:39,900
Have you talked to Vandy?

721
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,900
No I haven't talked to Vandy.

722
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,700
Will you just tell Emma to tell
her, I was trying to tell her
 but she just won't.

723
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:48,800
It wasn't about this other
 person, okay? It was all

724
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:50,900
HeY listen man, I'm not

725
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,100
No no, it was about us and our
shit, and that's even what she
was saying -

726
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:55,300
Did she? Oh really?

727
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:56,900
And I didn't even fucking sleep
with the other person -

728
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,500
You didn't?
No! No.
 You didn't sleep with her?

729
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:02,100
No I did not!
And she - You slept with her?
No I did not

730
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:04,100
Yes you did.
 I - Keith
 I can tell he did

731
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:06,300
Listen Keith you know me, I
wouldn't sleep with anybody.

732
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:07,500
She wouldn't listen to me.

733
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:09,400
Dude listen to me.

734
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:10,800
What?

735
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:15,700
I'm not Keith. I'm not Keith.
 I don't know you.

736
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:18,000
That ain't Keith.

737
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:21,100
Am I losing my mind?
That guy looks a lot like Keith.

738
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:22,800
He looks a lot like him but
 that's not Keith.

739
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:26,900
He looks like Keith.

740
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,700
He looks exactly like Keith!
I'm really sorry man.

741
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:30,700
It's cool.

742
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:33,100
I'm sorry that was fucked up
though.

743
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:36,100
Yeah that was a little fucked
up, umm I didn't know how that
was going to work out.

744
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:38,700
Yeah well I swear to God you
look exactly like my
brother-in-law,

745
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,400
or this guy who was going to be
 my brother-in-law.

746
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:41,400
He looks like him.

747
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:44,700
Wow. Okay. That is. Wow.

748
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:48,800
That guys was fucking with me.

749
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:51,700
No he wasn't you were fucking
with him. He told you he wasn't
Keith.

750
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:53,000
He pretended to be Keith.

751
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:54,100
He wasn't pretending.

752
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:55,300
He was pretending.

753
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:57,100
Sit your ass down, what's wrong
 with you.

754
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,500
Hey hey hey hey hey

755
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:01,500
You wish you were Keith. Keith's
 a pretty fucking cool guy.

756
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:10,700
I got an email from my mom
saying that Highheeled Shoes is
 a terrific movie

757
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,200
and that we should see it.

758
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:17,200
That's the one with the southern
bell with five southern bell
 daughters.

759
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:19,100
Interested?

760
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:22,100
I'd rather have my scrotum
 nailed to a chair.

761
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:29,900
Oh she also wanted to know if
you wanted to make that stuffing
for Thanksgiving again.

762
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,800
Does she need to know now?

763
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:38,300
Well do you want to make it
or... uh she needs to

764
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:43,500
going to take my dad to the
dermatologist and it's right
 next to the specialty store

765
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:45,200
where was going to order some of

766
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:46,900
Can I just call her?

767
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Yeah

768
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:57,000
Time for bed.

769
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:59,000
I'm not ready for bed.

770
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:02,100
Come on we've got a big day
 tomorrow.

771
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:08,500
I don't want you falling asleep
 out here again. Come on.

772
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:11,100
Why don't you stay here and talk
to me.

773
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:15,200
We can talk in bed.

774
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:17,800
I don't want to talk in bed.

775
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:33,700
So. What's going on?

776
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:42,000
Um

777
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:46,500
I thought you wanted to talk.

778
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:56,000
I'm going to the bedroom.

779
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:58,800
I'm not happy Vandy.

780
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:02,700
Yeah about like work and stuff?

781
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,100
Everything

782
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:07,600
Oh, can I help?

783
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:14,800
I don't know. I haven't been
too happy here either.

784
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:25,600
I don't know if I want to do
this anymore.

785
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:28,600
Nobody does this for no reason.
 Was there somebody else?

786
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:34,900
No! That's not, you're not,
that's - no - that's not what
this is about.

787
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:40,600
Okay, sometimes I think it just
comes down to whether or not two
 people should be together.

788
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:43,000
You don't think that we should
be together?

789
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:45,600
I don't know. I don't know
Vandy.

790
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:48,800
I mean the way we are now, no.
I don't want to be with you like
this.

791
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:57,000
Can you give me a reason?

792
00:55:57,100 --> 00:56:00,100
I thought about this recently.

793
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:06,000
I've been around a lot of new
people through work and it's
 like I'm

794
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:10,300
all these things are coming out
 of me all this stuff um,

795
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:16,100
it's me, it's everything that
 reminds me of who I am, me,

796
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:28,500
and I haven't felt like that in
 a long time. I'm not that
 person with you.

797
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:36,000
I think I used to be like that
with you but you've been trying
to kill it ever since.

798
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:38,600
It's like you're trying to kill
 me.

799
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:41,000
I'm not trying to kill you
Peter.

800
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:43,200
Not literally it's just me, who
I am.

801
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:50,000
Ever since the day we met it's
like, I mean that's exactly what
it feels like to me.

802
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:58,700
And it's not just you I mean I'm
sure I do it too but I need to
 be able to feel me.

803
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:05,100
I feel like I've been asleep.

804
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:12,700
A couple weeks ago remember that
you were acting really nice to
 me and genuinely

805
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:17,900
and I felt uncomfortable.

806
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:23,800
Like I was outside of my comfort
 zone with you being loving
 towards me.

807
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,000
It made me feel horrible.

808
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:39,300
I didn't want it to be like
this.

809
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:41,300
I didn't want it to be like this
either.

810
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:07,600
Don't ever leave me.
Don't ever leave me.

811
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:09,100
I'm not going to leave you.

812
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,400
Peter.

813
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:31,000
Yeah?

814
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:36,100
Is there someone else?

815
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:46,100
Is there someone else?

816
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:49,800
It wasn't anything

817
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:51,100
Oh my god!

818
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:51,800
Vandy

819
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:52,800
Oh my god!

820
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:54,000
No, no. Listen it was nothing.

821
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:55,700
Don't you, don't you fucking
 touch me!

822
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:57,000
Vandy, calm down

823
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:58,500
Holy shit

824
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:00,200
Listen to me. The problems that
we have are between us.

825
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:02,000
Nothing happened!

826
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:03,800
Shit I knew it.

827
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:06,200
Don't do this okay we got so far
 last night because I didn't
bring it up.

828
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:08,000
Let's just talk about it.

829
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:09,300
Get the fuck out oh my god get
out of here.

830
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:10,500
Like we talked about it last
night!

831
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:11,700
No, no, no, no. Just get out of
here get the fuck out.

832
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:12,500
Please don't do this.

833
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:14,500
Back up! Get Get out!

834
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:15,100
Alright.

835
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:30,900
Okay here's a question for you.
The crossword puzzle. You said
 you finished it.

836
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,200
I did.

837
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:33,700
What day of the week was it?

838
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:35,700
It was a Saturday.

839
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:37,900
Oh that's the toughest one,
right?

840
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:42,600
Yeah. My mom always does
crossword puzzles so I've been
 doing them forever.

841
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:44,900
I am impressed.

842
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:49,200
Yeah no, yeah it's a really
productive way of spending your
time.

843
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:52,300
Do you do crossword puzzles or.

844
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:57,100
No, that's good, so we don't
 have to fight over them.

845
00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:04,000
So I hope you didn't have to
change your schedule around too
 much to uh.

846
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:05,200
To what?

847
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:07,300
For dinner.

848
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:08,800
A little bit.

849
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:13,900
Yeah. I just meant uh, nothing
really.

850
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,600
You mean did I tell the guy I'm
seeing?

851
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:27,300
No, well no that's not what I.
That's not what I was expecting
 you to say.

852
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:33,200
I guess I was saying more like
did you have a date that you had
 to break off with him or.

853
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:37,600
I really was trying not to talk
about this more than anything,

854
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:39,400
and here I am just talking about
 it.

855
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:41,000
Okay.

856
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:42,300
I'm sorry.

857
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:44,200
No it's okay.

858
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:49,300
Sorry but you said you changed
your plans a little bit, though

859
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:51,800
Do you want to be talking about
it or.

860
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:56,100
I guess I do..?

861
01:00:56,200 --> 01:01:01,900
Um, well I was supposed to meet
up with him later but instead I
 broke up with him.

862
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:10,900
Oh, wow. Are you regretting
 that yet?

863
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Yeah. No. I wasn't thrilled
with the way things were going
 with him anyway.

864
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:20,400
No, well, of course - I'm sorry
I wasn't implying that you did
 it because of me.

865
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:24,200
That's okay. And it really
wasn't that nasty a break up.

866
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:26,400
So if this date goes really
badly

867
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:28,600
I think I still have a shot of
getting back together with him.

868
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:30,000
Good one.

869
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:31,400
Thanks.

870
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:34,400
Sorry I brought all this up.
It's stupid I'm sorry.

871
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:37,600
No why do you always..

872
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:39,500
What?

873
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:43,700
It's nothing.

874
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:48,100
No tell me please.

875
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:51,000
Well you apologize a lot.

876
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:55,600
Do I?

877
01:01:55,700 --> 01:01:57,700
Little bit.

878
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:05,700
Sorry about that. I'm kidding.
 No I know what you mean.

879
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:08,300
I'm not saying it like it's a
 problem.

880
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:13,000
No it's fine trust me it's
something that I'm aware of.

881
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:16,600
I feel like a jerkoff when I do
 it.

882
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:18,200
No that's not what I meant.

883
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:22,800
No. It's fine. I mean it. You
know what I think it is
 actually?

884
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:25,800
Tell me what you think because
I'm not, I'm not too sure myself
but,

885
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:30,700
no I think I apologize a lot
 when I'm.

886
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:34,300
Not really sorry?

887
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:37,000
That too. Yeah.

888
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:41,300
I no, I wasn't trying to turn
this into a nitpick session.

889
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:46,100
I don't know Jesus even on our
 first date.

890
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:48,100
No please are you kidding me?

891
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:54,300
This is exactly what I'm this is
the kind of stuff I would always
want you to tell me if we were,

892
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:59,700
um, no I'm glad you said it.
 Seriously.

893
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:03,000
Like I said I like to knock it
off so.

894
01:03:03,100 --> 01:03:10,900
Not a problem, honestly, bring
it on!

895
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:17,600
I am really glad I'm here with
you.

896
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:22,100
So am I.

897
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,500
No.

898
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:26,100
Nuhuh.

899
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:27,200
I insist.

900
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:28,500
I have it. Give me a break.

901
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:29,800
You got me a present.

902
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:31,400
The crossword puzzle?

903
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:32,500
Yeah.

904
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:34,300
You do realize that the New York
Times is $1?

905
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:35,800
Yeah but you had to get two.

906
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:38,200
Oh. You're right.
 It was a $2 gift.

907
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:43,000
Would it make you feel better if
 you left the tip?

908
01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:45,000
Fine.

909
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:48,600
Okay. You take care of the tip.

910
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:51,900
You're terrific.

911
01:04:09,100 --> 01:04:10,800
What do you think it was about?

912
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:14,600
Paul is a very good tipper.

913
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:15,900
No seriously.

914
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,400
Vandy, they've always been like
 that from day one.

915
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:21,500
They can't stay together like
that.

916
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:24,800
All Paul wanted to do was tip
 the guy.

917
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:29,500
Yeah you're not really supposed
to tip at these things. She's
right actually.

918
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:31,500
Are you serious?

919
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:32,400
Yeah.

920
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:33,600
You're an idiot.

921
01:04:33,700 --> 01:04:35,500
You're an idiot.

922
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:38,300
What's it like being the less
 intelligent person in the
relationship?

923
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:41,600
Good one.

924
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:42,600
Seriously.

925
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:44,000
Fuck off.

926
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:45,800
Maybe you and Keith should form
 a support group.

927
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:50,200
You know I am starving. Do you
mind if we just go home

928
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:53,500
and you can make me a nice
peanut butter and jelly
 sandwich.

929
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:58,800
No because I just ran the
dishwasher so there should be
 enough silverware for you.

930
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:09,000
Would you like to dance with me?

931
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:18,700
Have they always been like that?

932
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:21,300
They fought at their own
 wedding.

933
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:24,200
Like we just saw?

934
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:26,000
Maybe worse.

935
01:05:26,100 --> 01:05:31,800
Jesus. Why are they together?
Does Paul talk to you about this
stuff?

936
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:33,300
No.

937
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:35,600
That is so annoying to me.

938
01:05:35,700 --> 01:05:43,800
Can I tell you something you
promise you won't tell anyone?

939
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:45,900
I promise.

940
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,500
Promise you won't tell.

941
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:49,200
Oh my god just fucking tell me.

942
01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:56,100
There was this one time where
Paul told me that he was gonna
 leave her.

943
01:05:56,200 --> 01:06:01,400
Shut up. What did you say?

944
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:04,200
I told him not too.

945
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:06,500
Really?

946
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:08,000
Yeah.

947
01:06:08,100 --> 01:06:08,800
Why?

948
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:10,100
I don't know.

949
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:14,200
I can't believe you never told
 me that.

950
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:16,200
Yeah.

951
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:18,100
I mean jeeze what the hell do we
have to talk about you don't
 tell me that story?

952
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:19,300
He told me not to say anything.

953
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:20,700
So what you tell me anyway.

954
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:22,100
I know.

955
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:28,300
God that is so juicy. Seriously
why didn't you tell me that?

956
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:36,100
I would have told you it just
 happened during last year.

957
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:38,100
Yeah.

958
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:43,500
I just mean it happened during
winter.

959
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:49,900
Oh.

960
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:55,600
I love you.

961
01:06:55,700 --> 01:06:56,500
Whatever.

962
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:57,500
Come on.

963
01:06:57,600 --> 01:06:59,100
You come on.

964
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:23,600
I'm sorry.

965
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:29,600
So you and Paul you have a lot
in common huh.

966
01:07:29,700 --> 01:07:31,600
What do you mean?

967
01:07:31,700 --> 01:07:36,600
Is Paul seeing someone else?

968
01:07:36,700 --> 01:07:40,100
I don't believe so.

969
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:42,600
Oh that wasn't why you wanted to
leave her then.

970
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:44,300
No.

971
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:47,900
Well you're so good at it maybe
you should have given him some
of your tips

972
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,300
on breaking up with people.

973
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:58,300
I made a huge mistake I'm sorry.
I still - I'm sorry.

974
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:00,700
I don't want to hear you
 apologize.

975
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:05,900
Well I don't have any tips
because I've never broken up
with anyone.

976
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Really?

977
01:08:07,100 --> 01:08:09,700
It's hard to believe isn't?

978
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:11,600
Well I know a stud like you.

979
01:08:11,700 --> 01:08:14,700
But I mean it. Seriously
though.

980
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:15,800
Oh yeah.

981
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:17,000
Honest to God.

982
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:18,300
You are pushing it.

983
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:20,600
I had a couple girlfriends in
high school and college

984
01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:22,700
and they all just fizzled out
there were no actual break ups.

985
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:24,300
You're gonna keep going.

986
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:30,100
And then I got dumped once or
twice. Then I met you. And here
we are.

987
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:35,800
Here we are.

988
01:08:35,900 --> 01:08:40,400
Here we are.

989
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:51,400
Are there any other things you
have to do to get ready for your
trip?

990
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:57,300
We could just take it slow try
to work through things.

991
01:08:57,400 --> 01:09:04,500
I'm sorry. You told me to stop
apologizing. I don't know why I
keep doing it.

992
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:07,000
I'm not acting like myself.

993
01:09:10,900 --> 01:09:15,200
Peter.

994
01:09:15,300 --> 01:09:17,000
Yeah?

995
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:24,600
Everything that happened with us
happened for a reason. This is
who we are together.

996
01:09:24,700 --> 01:09:29,700
We're just going to stay the
same way it's not going to be
any different.

997
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:38,300
Yeah I know. I understand what
you're saying.

998
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:44,700
I understand you.
This is what I want.

999
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:48,600
You are the person that I have
 to be with.

1000
01:09:48,700 --> 01:09:52,200
Do you feel the same way?

1001
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:21,900
Where are my pants?

1002
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,100
Oh no, I'll do it. Sorry.

1003
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:32,500
It's okay. We should uh, see if
Highheeled Shoes is still
playing.

1004
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:34,900
Okay, that sounds great.

1005
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:38,700
I'm joking.

1006
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:40,500
Oh.

1007
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:44,700
You don't remember saying that
you'd rather have your scrotum
 nailed to a chair.

1008
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:48,900
You can see whatever movie you
 want, is my point.

1009
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,800
I'm aware of that.

1010
01:10:50,900 --> 01:10:56,000
No I know you are I'm just
saying that whatever you're into
that's fine with me.

1011
01:10:56,100 --> 01:11:01,000
No I just remember you saying
that and I thought it was funny

1012
01:11:01,100 --> 01:11:05,000
Right. Right. Yeah.

1013
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:16,100
Well there's like five movies
playing at the big theater in
 about three hours

1014
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:19,400
why don't we just go there then
and pick on.

1015
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:27,000
Okay. Maybe we could go have
brunch like an hour before the
movie starts.

1016
01:11:27,100 --> 01:11:28,600
You'll be hungry by then right?

1017
01:11:28,700 --> 01:11:30,600
I'll be fine but you haven't eaten.

1018
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:32,400
Oh I'm fine I'm not that hungry.

1019
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:35,500
Peter you're always hungry.
And you won't get your meal for a couple hours.

1020
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:37,800
It's fine. I can wait. I'm fine.

1021
01:11:37,900 --> 01:11:39,000
You don't have to.

1022
01:11:39,100 --> 01:11:40,900
You just ate.
 I'm really not that hungry.

1023
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,900
Peter.

1024
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,300
What?

1025
01:11:55,600 --> 01:12:03,000
I'm trying too hard

1026
01:12:03,100 --> 01:12:05,000
It's okay.

1027
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:10,200
Okay.
