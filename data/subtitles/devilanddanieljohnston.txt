Hello. Hello.



Hello, I am the ghost
of Daniel johnston.



Many years ago
I lived in Austin, Texas,



and I worked at McDonald's.



It is an honor and a privilege



to speak to you today,



to tell you about my condition,



and the other world.

<i>Ladies and gentlemen.</i>



<i>The best singer/songwriter</i>
<i>alive today,</i>



<i>Daniel johnston.</i>



(Audience cheering)



<i>Man: We love you, Daniel!</i>



¶(Singing .Silly love)



<i>¶ I've come this far</i>
<i>and I know I can make it ¶</i>



(people clapping)



<i>¶ I've got a broken heart</i>
<i>and you can't break</i>
<i>a broken heart ¶</i>



<i>¶ I come knocking</i>
<i>at your door ¶</i>



<i>¶ you don't love me anymore ¶</i>



<i>¶ but I just can't give up ¶</i>



<i>¶ 'cause I don't know</i>
<i>what to do about it ¶</i>



<i>¶ you must be wrong</i>
<i>if you think</i>
<i>you don't love me ¶</i>



<i>¶ you could smile down</i>
<i>and put a happy ending</i>
<i>to my song ¶</i>



<i>¶ I come knocking</i>
<i>at your door ¶</i>



<i>¶ you don't live there</i>
<i>anymore ¶</i>



<i>¶ is it just a memory? ¶</i>



<i>¶ or am I a little</i>
<i>crazy for you? ¶</i>



<i>mabel: He was different.</i>



<i>I noticed that from the start</i>
<i>that Dan was different.</i>



<i>I had him on a crib</i>
<i>in our little bedroom</i>



<i>and I would go in</i>
<i>and talk to him,</i>
<i>change his diaper,</i>



<i>and I would squeal at him</i>
<i>and he would squeal back</i>
<i>at me.</i>



That's a small baby
communicating, I thought.



Being, uh, six years younger
than his four brothers
and sisters,



<i>he was pampered by them.</i>



<i>And, uh, they nursed him along.</i>



<i>But we didn't notice</i>
<i>at that time</i>



<i>that there was</i>
<i>any special talents</i>
<i>involved or anything.</i>



<i>Mabel:</i>
<i>When he went to school,</i>
<i>they tested the kids,</i>



<i>and Dan was put</i>
<i>in the highest group</i>
<i>of the highest class.</i>



<i>His teacher was</i>
<i>really mad at him</i>
<i>and it's understandable</i>



<i>because Dan doesn't</i>
<i>follow directions.</i>



<i>You know,</i>
<i>when he was in junior high,</i>



<i>he suddenly lost</i>
<i>all his wonderful confidence,</i>



<i>and I guess it was</i>
<i>the beginning of his illness.</i>



<i>Bill: He and his brother</i>
<i>decided to make</i>
<i>their own movie.</i>



<i>And it was a collaborative</i>
<i>effort between the two</i>
<i>brothers working together.</i>



And Dan had to change clothes
and pretend to be his mother.



Because his mother and I
weren't in the movie actually.



<i>Tell about it, mabel.</i>



<i>(Ringing)</i>
<i>Mabel: Dan is the director</i>
<i>and the actor</i>



<i>portraying himself in parts</i>



<i>and his horrible mother</i>
<i>in other parts.</i>



<i>I think he was</i>
<i>having fun teasing me.</i>



<i>What do you think, bill?</i>



<i>Yeah, he... he was</i>
<i>doin' it for humor.</i>



<i>You are real lazy.</i>
<i>Wake up.</i>



<i>Dan's hard to deal</i>
<i>with sometimes.</i>



<i>He thought, "I'm artistic.</i>
<i>I shouldn't have to do</i>
<i>those things."</i>



<i>¶(Scatting)</i>



<i>Time to get up</i>
<i>and get ready for school.</i>



<i>Get up in there,</i>
<i>breakfast is ready.</i>



<i>He wanted to be comic</i>
<i>all the time. He just</i>
<i>couldn't get over it.</i>



Okay.



<i>They were having</i>
<i>too good a time.</i>



(Screaming)



<i>I don't think</i>
<i>his relationship</i>
<i>with me was typical.</i>



<i>Do you suppose he really</i>
<i>pictured me that way?</i>



<i>This is ridiculous,</i>
<i>what they're showing.</i>



<i>I think it's popcorn</i>
<i>and green kool-aid.</i>



<i>He was a trial.</i>



I was sort of
the star art guy
at the high school.



<i>David:</i>
<i>Oak Glen high school.</i>



<i>And I started hearing</i>
<i>rumors of this new art guy,</i>
<i>the new art star.</i>



<i>You know,</i>
<i>the... the new kid in town,</i>



<i>I had to find out who this was.</i>



<i>A friend of mine told me,</i>
<i>"there's this kid,</i>
<i>Dan johnston,</i>



<i>"he can really draw,</i>
<i>he's a musician</i>
<i>or something."</i>



<i>So he kind of had one</i>
<i>up on me, he was a musician.</i>



<i>The guy is a natural,</i>
<i>an absolute natural.</i>



<i>He never even had</i>
<i>to learn to draw.</i>



<i>He just got better from great.</i>



<i>You know, I had to</i>
<i>hang out with this guy.</i>



<i>I had to be around this art.</i>



<i>So we just started hanging out</i>
<i>and doing art together,</i>
<i>actually.</i>



<i>(People chattering)</i>



<i>The eyeball thing</i>
<i>was sort of like</i>
<i>his intro calling card.</i>



<i>Daniel: Did it</i>
<i>touch you emotionally?</i>



<i>It was his mysterious entry.</i>



<i>Girl: It's definitely</i>
<i>different.</i>



<i>Girl 2: I'm speechless.</i>



<i>Everybody was,</i>
<i>"who's the eyeball guy?"</i>



<i>You know, he was painting</i>
<i>these eyeballs everywhere.</i>



<i>He would actually draw</i>
<i>on walls all over</i>
<i>the high school.</i>



<i>Girl 3: I thought Dan's</i>
<i>was very imaginative.</i>



<i>Daniel, he just exudes art.</i>



<i>He... he can't stop</i>
<i>making art.</i>



<i>(People chattering)</i>



He never sits and thinks,
what am I gonna do?



He just grabs something.



¶(The story of an artist
<i>playing)</i>



<i>¶ Listen up</i>
<i>and I'll tell a story ¶</i>



<i>¶ about an artist growing old ¶</i>



<i>¶ some would try for</i>
<i>fame and glory ¶</i>



<i>¶ others aren't so bold ¶</i>



<i>¶ everyone,</i>
<i>and friends and family ¶</i>



<i>¶ saying, "hey! Get a job!" ¶</i>



<i>¶ "why do you only</i>
<i>do that only? ¶</i>



<i>¶ "why are you so odd? ¶</i>



<i>¶ "we don't really like</i>
<i>what you do ¶</i>



<i>¶ "we don't think</i>
<i>anyone ever will ¶</i>



<i>¶ "it's a problem</i>
<i>that you have ¶</i>



<i>¶ "and this problem's</i>
<i>made you ill" ¶</i>



<i>¶ the artist walks alone ¶</i>



<i>¶ someone says</i>
<i>behind his back ¶</i>



<i>¶ "he's got his gall</i>
<i>to call himself that! ¶</i>



<i>¶ "he doesn't even know</i>
<i>where he's at!" ¶</i>



<i>bill: He wasn't buyin' them</i>
<i>for comic books,</i>



<i>he was buying them for</i>
<i>the artwork that was</i>
<i>involved on the comics.</i>



<i>And some of the artists</i>
<i>were his incentive</i>



<i>to try to be an artist himself.</i>



<i>They were</i>
<i>an inspiration to him.</i>



<i>David: Now talk about</i>
<i>the cinema of</i>
<i>Daniel johnston, then.</i>



<i>He doesn't have influences.</i>



<i>He doesn't sit down</i>
<i>and consciously watch chaplin</i>



<i>and then learn,</i>
<i>or this is my keaton period.</i>



<i>It's not like that.</i>
<i>He doesn't even know</i>
<i>who these guys are.</i>



<i>(Chuckles)</i>
<i>You know, he gets a super 8</i>
<i>and he makes a movie.</i>



Dan took himself seriously.



He, for some reason,
thought he was going to be



an artist because probably
of the attention he got.



<i>The family room would</i>
<i>sometimes be almost</i>
<i>full of kids</i>



<i>and one of them told me</i>
<i>that he's gonna be</i>
<i>famous someday.</i>



<i>And I thought,</i>
<i>that silly stuff, you know?</i>



<i>David: He lived</i>
<i>in the basement of</i>
<i>his parents' house.</i>



<i>They got this perfectly</i>
<i>normal ranch house</i>
<i>out in the country</i>



<i>behind new cumberland.</i>



<i>He's got this amazing lab,</i>



<i>like this amazing</i>
<i>factory downstairs.</i>



<i>He's turned a garage</i>
<i>and two sort of utility rooms</i>



<i>into a bedroom</i>
<i>and an art factory,</i>



<i>and he's just got</i>
<i>everywhere, magazines, tapes.</i>



<i>In fact, he's</i>
<i>recreated it in waller,</i>
<i>where he lives today.</i>



<i>It's a duplicate</i>
<i>of the same room.</i>



¶ I was guilt stricken ¶



¶ to go away ¶



¶ she turned without saying ¶



¶ I could not stay ¶



¶ and all the while ¶



¶ she was smiling at me ¶



¶ like I was a show on her TV ¶



they're sort of like this



<i>Christian fundamentalist</i>
<i>glass family.</i>



<i>They're creative,</i>
<i>they're intellectual,</i>



<i>but there's this, like,</i>
<i>West Virginia, kind of</i>
<i>right-wing Christian thing.</i>



<i>Daniel wasn't havin' any of it.</i>



<i>Spiritually he was</i>
<i>separated from them,</i>



<i>socially, every other way</i>
<i>he was gone from them.</i>



<i>But at the same time</i>
<i>he was of them,</i>



<i>in the sense that</i>
<i>he had certain material</i>
<i>to draw from.</i>



Bill and I both thought he was



doing too much
concentrating on the art



and the music and he wasn't



having a well rounded life.



<i>¶(People singing hymn)</i>



<i>David: She would constantly</i>
<i>try to get him, "go to church</i>
<i>and save yourself,"</i>



<i>and he just</i>
<i>would have none of it.</i>



<i>He'd go to church, even,</i>
<i>but he wouldn't participate.</i>



<i>He'd go to church</i>
<i>so he could</i>
<i>stare at the girls,</i>



<i>try to find a girlfriend.</i>



<i>Literally, all he cared</i>
<i>about was making art</i>
<i>and being John Lennon,</i>



<i>and his parents' rules</i>
<i>were in the way of that.</i>



<i>All he wanted them</i>
<i>to do was just</i>



<i>keep the lights on,</i>
<i>keep the power on</i>
<i>so he could draw.</i>



<i>Mabel: Dan was</i>
<i>getting to be a problem.</i>



<i>And he wanted to do everything</i>



<i>but he didn't want to</i>
<i>do any of his chores,</i>



<i>like help mow the lawn,</i>
<i>or wash the car,</i>



or any of those things
that I thought he was
lackin' in training,



and I had to settle that.



<i>(Mabel speaking on tape)</i>



<i>(Daniel speaking on tape)</i>



<i>(Mabel speaking)</i>



<i>(Daniel speaking)</i>



<i>(Mabel speaking)</i>



<i>(Daniel laughing)</i>



<i>(Mabel speaking)</i>



(Clicking)



Every bit of the... of the
supposed persecution



that Daniel portrays
in early music was there,



but, um, but I'm not saying
it was without provocation.



<i>He did it.</i>
<i>He brought it on himself.</i>



<i>He... he would cause it</i>



<i>to tape record, to film.</i>



<i>Many, many times, mabel would</i>
<i>open the basement stairs door</i>



<i>and she used to call him</i>
<i>an unprofitable servant.</i>



<i>"You're an unprofitable</i>
<i>servant of the lord.</i>



"You need to leave the house
and get a job."



He turned it,
he used to call himself
an unserviceable prophet.



<i>(Mabel speaking)</i>



I really didn't like it
when he put...



He taped me
giving him what for.



I didn't think
he would do that.



She would really
harangue him and, uh,
and he... he, um...



It was hard on him. It was.



<i>But he's this sort of like,</i>



<i>coal burning in the basement,</i>
<i>you know,</i>



<i>and it's heating up</i>
<i>the whole house,</i>



<i>and they're just</i>
<i>going insane from it.</i>



<i>So the whole place is</i>
<i>just going wild</i>



<i>because he's just</i>
<i>such a problem.</i>



<i>¶(Piano playing)</i>



<i>Bill: When the problem</i>
<i>became apparent</i>



<i>was when he first</i>
<i>went to college,</i>



<i>at abilene Christian college.</i>



<i>And, uh, he wasn't</i>
<i>getting to his classes.</i>



<i>He was totally confused</i>



<i>and, uh, we thought,</i>
<i>well, this is home sickness,</i>
<i>you know,</i>



and they sent him
to the local doctor



to see if he was complaining
about pains in his arms,



which are symptoms
of manic depression.



<i>(Daniel speaking)</i>



(Clicking)



He's going around in a daze,
we said, "well, we'd better
bring him home."



<i>And immediately</i>
<i>he snapped out of it.</i>



<i>And then back to being</i>
<i>a normal person again.</i>



<i>And we thought,</i>
<i>"well, everything's</i>
<i>all right."</i>



<i>So we sent him</i>
<i>to a local college.</i>



<i>David: He goes</i>
<i>to art school at</i>



<i>Kent state university branch</i>
<i>in east liverpool, Ohio.</i>



<i>And I am attending</i>
<i>the same school.</i>



<i>We found all these kind</i>
<i>of lethargic professors</i>



<i>and sort of</i>
<i>half-talented students.</i>



<i>And, Daniel, of course,</i>
<i>he just scoops them up</i>



<i>and he just mixes them</i>
<i>into his art form.</i>



<i>Like everybody's his subject,</i>
<i>you know, all of a sudden</i>
<i>he's interviewing people</i>



<i>with his little tape recorder</i>
<i>and then taking</i>
<i>little phrases from them</i>



<i>and cutting them</i>
<i>into his songs.</i>



<i>And he meets</i>
<i>the love of his life.</i>
<i>He meets Laurie Allen.</i>



<i>Daniel: I was alone</i>
<i>in my life</i>



<i>with little to live for,</i>



<i>¶(piano playing)</i>



<i>Trying my hand at art,</i>



<i>thinking that maybe</i>
<i>I could save myself,</i>



<i>but in my desperation</i>



<i>all my hope would fly away</i>



<i>until there was</i>
<i>nothing left of me,</i>



<i>nothing left to say.</i>



<i>And in this nightmare</i>
<i>there was a dream</i>



<i>of a girl</i>



<i>so beautiful beyond compare.</i>



<i>The girl of my dreams.</i>



<i>So wonderful.</i>
<i>So beautiful.</i>



<i>And I had her boots.</i>



<i>This was so long ago</i>
<i>in my idealistic dream</i>



<i>of so many songs.</i>



<i>Laurie.</i>



Yes.



She inspired a thousand songs



and then I knew
I was an artist.



He wrote a lot of sweet songs
about Laurie.



And I remember something
from listening he wanted
to play one for me.



I remember it
and he doesn't have it.



It goes...



¶ Walking down the road
I'm feeling lonely ¶



¶ but don't be sad ¶



¶ be glad you're just
one step closer to the girl
you're going to meet ¶



<i>David: He starts</i>
<i>following her around</i>
<i>with a tape recorder</i>



<i>and... and his little super 8,</i>



<i>following her around,</i>
<i>making movies and</i>
<i>tape recording her</i>



<i>and begging her,</i>



<i>begging Laurie to say,</i>
<i>"I love you, Dan,"</i>



<i>into the tape,</i>
<i>which she eventually does.</i>



<i>(Daniel speaking)</i>



<i>(Laurie speaking)</i>



She has no idea.



He's massively



obsessed with her.



<i>(Daniel speaking)</i>



<i>David: This is the kind</i>
<i>of love he needed to have.</i>



<i>He needed to have a love</i>
<i>that he couldn't</i>
<i>really successfully</i>



<i>connect up with.</i>



<i>He had to have</i>
<i>the thing to chase.</i>



<i>He could never have</i>
<i>a thing he could catch.</i>



<i>So, when she married</i>
<i>someone else,</i>



<i>it was even better because</i>
<i>then he could really pine.</i>



<i>You know, she was gone.</i>



<i>And it's just God's</i>
<i>little joke that it happens</i>
<i>to be an undertaker.</i>



<i>So he really liked that event</i>



<i>even though</i>
<i>it causes him great pain.</i>



Well, when Dan got depressed,



he took to playing the piano,
but I didn't understand
the depression.



¶(I had lost my mind <i> playing)</i>



<i>¶ I had lost my mind ¶</i>



<i>¶ I lost my head for a while ¶</i>



<i>¶ was off my rocker,</i>
<i>out of line, out of whack ¶</i>



<i>¶ you see I had this</i>
<i>tiny crack in my head ¶</i>



<i>¶ that slowly split open</i>
<i>and my brains oozed out ¶</i>



<i>¶ it's lying on the sidewalk</i>
<i>and I didn't even know it ¶</i>



<i>¶ I had lost my mind ¶</i>



<i>¶ why, I was sitting</i>
<i>in the basement when I</i>
<i>first realized it was gone ¶</i>



<i>¶ got in my car</i>
<i>rushed right over</i>
<i>to the lost and found ¶</i>



<i>¶ I said, "pardon me</i>
<i>but I seem to have</i>
<i>lost my mind" ¶</i>



<i>¶ she said, "well,</i>
<i>can you identify it please?" ¶</i>



<i>¶ I said, "why sure,</i>
<i>it's a cute little bugger ¶</i>



<i>¶ "about yea big a little</i>
<i>warped from the rain" ¶</i>



<i>¶ she said, "well then, sir,</i>
<i>this must be your brain" ¶</i>



<i>¶ I said, "thank you, ma'am,</i>
<i>I'm always losing</i>
<i>that dang thing" ¶</i>



<i>¶ I had lost my mind ¶</i>



we felt that it was,
uh, wasting time



to keep him in college



because he was
never gonna graduate
the way he was goin'.



<i>So we took him out of college</i>
<i>and sent him to, uh,</i>



<i>Houston to live</i>
<i>with his brother.</i>



Mom and dad were
trying to get him
on the right track.



In all of our minds,
that meant a productive life.



<i>A well rounded life.</i>



<i>Not a self-absorbed life.</i>
<i>A job is part of that.</i>



<i>And in an effort to help,</i>



<i>I said, "let Dan come down</i>
<i>for the summer,</i>
<i>work at astroworld.</i>



<i>"And maybe this will get him</i>
<i>on his feet or something."</i>



<i>(Daniel whispering)</i>



<i>Dick: When he found out</i>
<i>that he had to go to Texas</i>



<i>and he would be</i>
<i>without his piano,</i>



<i>that put a wrench in his plans.</i>



<i>So he got ahold of this organ</i>



<i>and he takes it into my garage</i>



<i>and he turned my weight bench</i>
<i>into a recording studio.</i>



<i>Daniel: How are you doing,</i>
<i>Dave? How's it going?</i>



<i>I'm working on the album now.</i>



<i>On the new release,</i>
yip/jump music.



<i>I sound like some kind</i>
<i>of mtv person, don't I?</i>



<i>I brought out the chord organ.</i>
<i>I just set it up.</i>



<i>I thought I'd play you</i>
<i>one of the songs</i>
<i>I played on the album.</i>



<i>So, I'll turn on</i>
<i>the chord organ here.</i>



<i>Dick: I knew he was recording.</i>
<i>I could hear him singing.</i>



<i>But I... I had no perception</i>
<i>that he was,</i>



<i>you know, in his mind,</i>
<i>making this masterpiece.</i>



¶(Chord organ blues .Playing)



¶(Daniel singing)



<i>Dick: I wanted to help Dan</i>
<i>and I thought I was giving</i>
<i>great prophetic advice.</i>



<i>I said, "Dan, you know,</i>
<i>someday you're gonna</i>
<i>be really good</i>



<i>"at something</i>
<i>and very successful.</i>



<i>"But it's not gonna be</i>
<i>your art and it's not</i>
<i>gonna be your music."</i>



<i>We had to say, "look, Dan,</i>
<i>you can't stay up all night.</i>



<i>"You're gonna have</i>
<i>to go to bed at some</i>
<i>kind of decent hour.</i>



"And kind of live life
with the rest of us."



<i>(Daniel speaking)</i>



<i>Margie kind of</i>
<i>stepped in and said</i>
<i>that she could, uh,</i>



<i>you know, see what</i>
<i>she could do to help him.</i>



<i>And we packed him up</i>
<i>and off he went into</i>
<i>the distance.</i>



I thought, well...



Uh, he needs a place to go
and I'm his sister,



and, well, he can come
and stay here.



So he came to live
with me in my duplex.



<i>Now, I didn't have</i>
<i>extra furniture for him.</i>



<i>We got him a mattress</i>
<i>that was just on the floor.</i>



<i>But he seemed to thrive</i>
<i>in this atmosphere</i>



<i>because he was</i>
<i>allowed to make a mess.</i>



<i>(Daniel speaking)</i>



I thought everything was fine.
Then one day I came home



and he wasn't there, which...



I wasn't too worried 'cause
we didn't tell each other
everywhere we were going.



But, uh, when he wasn't there
in the morning when I got up,



and he hadn't
come home all night,
that was not typical.



<i>Mabel: He made a decision</i>
<i>to buy a moped.</i>



<i>(Engine revving)</i>



And he disappeared
on the moped,
right, bill?



Yes.



And he joined
the carnival and
went with them.



<i>We weren't able to contact him.</i>



<i>It's the saddest time</i>
<i>in my life,</i>



<i>not to know where your son is</i>
<i>and he might be needing help.</i>



¶(Daniel singing)



<i>Daniel: When I was</i>
<i>with the carnival,</i>



<i>this little girl</i>
<i>at the carnival,</i>
<i>her name was tricia.</i>



<i>She's a carnival girl.</i>
<i>She's grown up</i>
<i>with the carnival</i>



<i>and she's about</i>
<i>three years old.</i>



<i>All the time she would</i>
<i>come into the corndog stand</i>
<i>when we were open.</i>



<i>And it was slow, you know,</i>
<i>and we would pretend it was</i>
<i>a spaceship, you know.</i>



<i>I would bang on</i>
<i>this untuned guitar</i>



<i>and she started singing</i>
<i>this little song,</i>



<i>¶ "pizza hut, pizza hut,</i>
<i>merry-go-round" ¶</i>



<i>yeah, I do miss home.</i>



<i>I'm down here and I'm okay.</i>



<i>Because wherever I am,</i>
<i>I got music in my heart.</i>



<i>Mabel: During that time,</i>
<i>I had a... a rock</i>
<i>inside my chest.</i>



<i>I thought he might be</i>
<i>in a shallow grave someplace.</i>



<i>He left the first part of April</i>



<i>and I think it was</i>
<i>father's day when he called</i>



<i>and let us know where he was.</i>



<i>Daniel: Collect call from</i>
<i>Daniel johnston, please.</i>



¶(Speeding motorcycle <i>playing)</i>



<i>¶ Speeding motorcycle ¶</i>



<i>¶ of my heart ¶</i>



<i>¶ pretty girls have</i>
<i>taken you for a ride ¶</i>



<i>¶ hurt you deep inside ¶</i>



<i>¶ the road is ours ¶</i>



the way Daniel ended up
in Austin is so incredible



that it really sounds
like an urban legend.



<i>When the carnival came</i>
<i>to Austin,</i>



<i>he was going to the bathroom</i>
<i>in the porta-potty</i>



<i>and someone was upset</i>
<i>about how long he was taking</i>



<i>and they were</i>
<i>banging on the door.</i>



<i>And so when he came out,</i>
<i>it turned out it was like a</i>
<i>really big, tough carnie guy.</i>



<i>And he just hauled off</i>
<i>and like, socked him.</i>



<i>And really,</i>
<i>really hurt him bad.</i>



<i>And Daniel didn't know</i>
<i>what to do.</i>



<i>¶(Hymn playing)</i>
<i>He just started looking</i>
<i>for a church of Christ.</i>



<i>And, uh, he wandered until</i>
<i>he saw the university</i>
<i>church of Christ.</i>



<i>And he went in and he just</i>
<i>asked them to help him.</i>



<i>And they ended up taking him,</i>
<i>you know, to the doctor</i>
<i>and everything</i>



<i>and leasing him an apartment.</i>



<i>(Daniel speaking)</i>



(Train horn blowing)



<i>¶(Rock music playing)</i>



<i>Kathy: He had heard</i>
<i>the band I was in,</i>
<i>which was glass eye.</i>



<i>And we were just</i>
<i>getting popular locally.</i>



<i>And he saw</i>
<i>a poster for our show.</i>



<i>And he decided that this was</i>
<i>a really magical sign</i>



<i>and he really</i>
<i>needed to go to it.</i>



<i>And he came to the show</i>
<i>and he gave me a copy</i>
<i>of his cassette.</i>



<i>So the next time we played,</i>
<i>he came over to me</i>
<i>and he was so excited.</i>



You could tell he was like,
screwing up his nerve,



like, getting ready to, like,



ask me what I thought
of his music.



And he came over and he goes,
"what'd you think?"



And I looked at him
and I couldn't,



I just couldn't
really let him know



how much of an asshole
I really was, that I hadn't
even listened to his music,



his most important thing
in his life. And I said,



"it was great.



"I loved it. You can totally
open for us."



<i>And so I went home and I</i>
<i>listened to it and I was</i>



<i>blown away at</i>
<i>its incredible genius.</i>



¶(Daniel singing)



I met Daniel johnston,
in kind of the classic
Daniel johnston way.



<i>It was a Saturday.</i>
<i>I was working</i>
<i>at the</i> Austin chronicle.



<i>I was alone in the office</i>
<i>and I was sitting there</i>
<i>writing,</i>



<i>and I heard something</i>
<i>at the door. Not a knock.</i>



<i>But somebody like,</i>
<i>shuffling at the door.</i>



<i>Finally I went over</i>
<i>and I opened the door,</i>
<i>and Daniel was standing there.</i>



<i>And he was this skinny</i>
<i>little kid who looked</i>
<i>fairly demented.</i>



<i>And he had a tape.</i>
<i>And he said, "I just wanted</i>
<i>to give you my tape."</i>



<i>So I said, "great.</i>
<i>You know, I'll give it</i>
<i>to a music person.</i>



<i>"If they like it,</i>
<i>maybe we'll review it.</i>



<i>"But I'm not</i>
<i>promising you anything."</i>



<i>And Daniel goes, "you know,</i>
<i>I wasn't really giving you</i>
<i>that to review.</i>



<i>"I just wanted you to listen</i>
<i>to it. I'm not trying to get</i>
<i>a review or anything."</i>



<i>So Daniel goes away.</i>



<i>And I put it on</i>
<i>the tape player</i>
<i>and it just blew my mind.</i>



<i>I mean, it was one of those</i>
<i>where I got it right away.</i>



¶(Urge <i> playing)</i>



<i>¶ Get attached</i>
<i>to a rolling stone ¶</i>



<i>¶ and you're liable</i>
<i>to get crushed ¶</i>



<i>¶ you're better off</i>
<i>to sit at home ¶</i>



<i>¶ and watch the toilet flush ¶</i>



and so then he gives you
<i>hi, how are you</i>
and <i> yip/jump music.</i>



It's like, you know,
imagine meeting,



you know, Bob Dylan,
and he gives you his
first six albums and saying,



"here's some stuff
I'm working on."



<i>So it's this body of music</i>
<i>where you're suddenly hearing</i>



<i>20 amazing songs</i>



<i>and... and they're</i>
<i>out of nowhere from</i>
<i>this weird little guy.</i>



<i>I played it for</i>
<i>a lot of music writers</i>
<i>and some musicians</i>



<i>and he was giving it</i>
<i>to other musicians,</i>



<i>and gradually over like</i>
<i>a period of weeks,</i>



<i>people began to talk a lot</i>
<i>about who this crazy kid was.</i>



<i>Daniel johnston</i>
<i>and this really weird music.</i>



<i>¶ The picture</i>
<i>gets all blurred ¶</i>



<i>¶ I see shadows</i>
<i>dancing on my walls ¶</i>



<i>¶ thoughts scatter like birds ¶</i>



Daniel, of course,
loves the Beatles,
worships them.



And, uh, I can see that
<i>hi, how are you</i> could be
like <i> meet the Beatles!</i>



<i>Come grab this</i>
<i>and start the new</i>
<i>Daniel johnston mania!</i>



<i>And in his head,</i>
<i>of course, it was there.</i>



<i>He was the Beatles.</i>



And it was from
deep inside here.



Hi, how are you?
I'm Daniel johnston,



and this is what scares me
and this is what I love,



and this is what terrifies me.



<i>Ken: You just hear that</i>
<i>and, uh, your mind will</i>
<i>turn around to his.</i>



<i>You start off hearing</i>
<i>this noise,</i>



<i>then eventually</i>
<i>you hear the Beatles.</i>



<i>You hear the whole symphony.</i>



He actually didn't
just record a tape
and mass produce it.



<i>He sometimes couldn't</i>
<i>duplicate, so he had</i>
<i>to sing the entire tape</i>



<i>from beginning to end</i>
<i>to hand you a copy.</i>



<i>Go back home. Start again.</i>
<i>Song by song.</i>
<i>Fill up the tape.</i>



<i>Hand another person a copy.</i>



<i>Fill it up. Go. And finally</i>
<i>write another album.</i>



Start the whole process
over again.



<i>Kathy: As far as I know</i>
<i>his very first, like,</i>
<i>public show that he did</i>



<i>was done opening for glass eye.</i>



<i>And he was so nervous.</i>



<i>He literally was vibrating.</i>



<i>And he also had</i>
<i>recently decided,</i>
<i>since coming to Austin,</i>



<i>that he wasn't gonna</i>
<i>play piano anymore,</i>
<i>something he does rather well.</i>



<i>He decided that he was</i>
<i>gonna play guitar like all</i>
<i>the Austin guitar slingers.</i>



<i>And he really couldn't play.</i>



<i>That was scary for him, too.</i>



All of a sudden
it quieted down like
it was church or something.



Daniel comes on stage.
It was very unusual



<i>because anyone playing</i>
<i>their first show,</i>
<i>it's like you're lucky</i>



<i>to get anyone to pay attention.</i>



<i>But everyone was</i>
<i>absolutely silent and</i>
<i>he looked so nervous,</i>



<i>he looked like he was</i>
<i>gonna vomit the whole time.</i>



¶(Tears stupid tears <i> playing)</i>



<i>¶ Time is a matter of fact ¶</i>



<i>¶ and it's gone</i>
<i>and it'll never come back ¶</i>



<i>¶ and mine ¶</i>



<i>¶ it's wasted all the time ¶</i>



<i>¶ tears, stupid tears ¶</i>



<i>¶ bring me down ¶</i>



<i>Louis: So when you</i>
<i>saw him perform,</i>



<i>I mean, especially</i>
<i>in the early days, when he did</i>
<i>the two or three song sets,</i>



sometimes
they were God-awful,



and sometimes they were
unbelievably brilliant.



I mean, sometimes
he just nailed it.



I mean, sometimes
it was so abstract.



<i>I mean, some of it was</i>
<i>what wasn't there.</i>



<i>Sometimes there was</i>
<i>too much not there.</i>



<i>¶ Tie my brain ¶</i>



<i>¶ into a knot ¶</i>



<i>¶ those tears, stupid tears ¶</i>



<i>¶ bring me down ¶</i>



people in the audience
tended to be like,



"what? Is this is a joke?
Is this guy
supposed to be cool?"



And they would be looking
around at each other like,
"how am I supposed to react?"



Because he was so raw
and so real in a lot of ways,
that people couldn't take it.



(Interviewer speaking)



<i>Louis: He's got</i>
<i>a full shift</i>
<i>at McDonald's.</i>



<i>And as close as I can tell,</i>
<i>he can't do anything.</i>



He can't cook.
He doesn't clean very well.



<i>Dick: As in a lot of places,</i>
<i>you know,</i>
<i>they'll give him work,</i>



<i>but then he migrates to</i>
<i>the job with the least skill,</i>



<i>which was cleaning tables.</i>



<i>Ken: It was amazing that</i>
<i>he could keep his job</i>



<i>because everybody was always</i>
<i>coming in there wanting to,</i>



<i>"hey, Daniel. Hi, Daniel!"</i>



<i>And, well, they don't</i>
<i>take well to that at,</i>
<i>you know, fast food joints.</i>



<i>But he was employed there</i>
<i>for a long time.</i>



<i>And you knew you could</i>
<i>find him there,</i>



<i>just in his little hat</i>
<i>and his little shirt there,</i>



cleanin' up,



cleanin' up other people's
spills and stuff.



<i>Dick: When I went to</i>
<i>visit him at McDonald's,</i>



<i>I think it was probably</i>
<i>the first time I</i>
<i>recognized that</i>



<i>he was spacing out, you know.</i>



<i>That there was</i>
<i>a disconnection from reality</i>
<i>or something going on.</i>



(Daniel speaking)



<i>(Daniel speaking)</i>



1985 was just an enormous year
for Austin music.



It was like everything
was about to break,



and... and again,
Daniel just came in
right at that time.



<i>Mtv started sniffing around.</i>
<i>And they brought in</i>
<i>Peter zaremba</i>



<i>and the show they had,</i>
the cutting edge.



<i>They lined up all these bands</i>



<i>and they had a big old barbeque</i>



<i>and Daniel showed up</i>
<i>there with his tapes.</i>



This is Daniel johnston.
Local man about town.
Musician.



Everyone knows who he is
but... say hi to everyone.



My name is Daniel johnston



and this is the name
of my tape and it's,
<i>hi, how are you.</i>



And I, I was having
a nervous breakdown
when I recorded it.



He wasn't scheduled
to be on the show.



They had already
listened to tapes



and talked to people
at the <i> chronicle</i>
and the music critics



and they decided who was
gonna be on this special
and everything.



<i>But Daniel was unstoppable</i>
<i>at that point.</i>



<i>He was so full of confidence.</i>



<i>He always</i>
<i>presented himself like,</i>



<i>"I am a very incredible,</i>
<i>extraordinary human being</i>



<i>"and you're gonna be</i>
<i>really happy</i>
<i>you listened to this."</i>



<i>How you doing? We are having</i>
<i>a casual conversation</i>
<i>on national TV.</i>



Daniel is on mtv.



You know, out of nowhere,
from my point of view.



And, uh, he's... he's on mtv
and I actually do
get to see it.



And, uh, he says to me...



<i>This is to David thornberry</i>
<i>from Daniel johnston.</i>



<i>And, Dave, here I am on mtv,</i>
<i>holding up my tape,</i>
hi, how are you.



<i>And they're recording me</i>
<i>tonight. I'm on mtv.</i>



<i>Remember when we used to</i>
<i>watch mtv back home?</i>



<i>Look, I'm on mtv, David.</i>



And that was his dream.
I mean, literally, that's
what he wanted to do,



is be on mtv.



(Audience cheering)



¶(I live my broken dreams
<i>playing)</i>



(People whistling)



<i>¶ When I was out</i>
<i>in San marcos ¶</i>



<i>¶ a year ago today ¶</i>



<i>¶ they probably would've</i>
<i>put me in a home ¶</i>



<i>¶ but I threw</i>
<i>all my belongings</i>
<i>into a garbage bag ¶</i>



<i>¶ and out into the worldness</i>
<i>I did roam ¶</i>



<i>¶ my hopes lay shattered</i>
<i>like a mirror on the floor ¶</i>



<i>¶ I see myself and I</i>
<i>looked really scattered ¶</i>



<i>¶ but I lived</i>
<i>my broken dreams ¶</i>



<i>Brian: He always knew</i>
<i>where to be</i>
<i>at any given moment</i>



<i>and while this was</i>
<i>being filmed it was,</i>
<i>like, mtv...</i>



<i>He knew mtv is here in town.</i>



<i>And by far he became</i>
<i>one of the most memorable</i>
<i>things from the show</i>



<i>and he basically</i>
<i>just scammed his way into it.</i>



<i>¶ The wildest summer ¶</i>



<i>¶ that I ever knew ¶</i>



<i>¶ I had a flat tire</i>
<i>down memory Lane ¶</i>



<i>¶ but I came back ¶</i>



<i>¶ after five months</i>
<i>and a half ¶</i>



<i>¶ and now I'm just</i>
<i>trying to explain ¶</i>



<i>¶ and now I'm here ¶</i>



<i>¶ and here I stand ¶</i>



<i>¶ with a sweet angel ¶</i>



<i>¶ holding my hand ¶</i>



<i>¶ I lived my broken dreams ¶</i>



(people whooping)



(Audience cheering)



<i>(Daniel speaking)</i>



<i>Louis: Instantly McDonald's</i>
<i>expands his hours to, like,</i>



<i>20 or 30 hours a week.</i>
<i>They give him more shifts.</i>



<i>Not because he's doing</i>
<i>anything, but because</i>
<i>he's become a star.</i>



<i>And whoever the manager is,</i>
<i>thinks this is entertaining.</i>



<i>And then the other weird thing</i>
<i>that begins happening is,</i>



<i>there's all this</i>
<i>interest in Daniel.</i>



<i>So you hear record companies</i>
<i>are calling McDonald's</i>



<i>'cause that's the only way</i>
<i>you can call Daniel.</i>
<i>Daniel doesn't have a phone.</i>



So <i> spin</i> is calling McDonald's
and music magazines...



So you get all these calls...



And in the beginning I think
the McDonald's people



were really kind of
entertained by this.



But after a while, when you'd
call to talk to Daniel,
they were not happy.



They had hamburgers to make.



<i>And then in 1986,</i>
<i>he wins a bunch of awards</i>
<i>in the Austin music awards.</i>



<i>He wins songwriter</i>
<i>of the year and best folk act,</i>
<i>which is very controversial</i>



<i>and, of course,</i>
<i>it goes to Daniel's head</i>
<i>in new and different ways.</i>



In a town with a lot
of singer/songwriters
and a lot of folkies,



who can play guitar,



that might've not gone
over too well with
some people.



¶(Casper the friendly ghost
<i>playing)</i>



¶ He was smiling through
his own personal hell ¶



¶ dropped his last dime
in a wishing well ¶



¶ but he was hoping to close
and then he fell ¶



¶ now he's Casper
the friendly ghost ¶



in the spring of 1986, um,
I started helping Daniel.



The first thing I did was
set up his publishing company
with bug music.



<i>I knew his music was great,</i>
<i>but I felt like for him to</i>
<i>actually make a living,</i>



<i>he would be better off</i>
<i>if other,</i>
<i>more well-known artists</i>



<i>were to cover his material.</i>



¶ He was always polite
to the people who'd tell him ¶



¶ that he was nothing
but a lazy bum ¶



¶ but goodbye to them
he had to go ¶



¶ now he's Casper ¶



¶ the friendly ghost ¶



I thought that he was
almost angelic.



And then I got to
know him better.



And we started being
really close friends.



And for a little while
I was his "girlfriend."



<i>And because he was</i>
<i>very religious,</i>



<i>this was a very chaste</i>
<i>relationship.</i>



<i>But even within</i>
<i>the context of that,</i>



<i>it was undeniable</i>
<i>after maybe one or two weeks</i>



<i>that something was</i>
<i>dreadfully wrong with him.</i>



<i>Something that wasn't angelic</i>
<i>and pure and naive</i>



<i>and innocent and beautiful.</i>



<i>So I realized I can't let him</i>
<i>keep on thinking that</i>
<i>I'm his girlfriend</i>



<i>because his parents came</i>
<i>to visit him</i>



<i>and he introduced me</i>
<i>as his fiancee.</i>



I realized that I was
going to have to say,



"Daniel, we're not
going out anymore, you know.



"We're just friends."



<i>And I essentially spent,</i>
<i>oh, the entire summer</i>
<i>reminding him.</i>



<i>We broke up.</i>



<i>(Daniel speaking)</i>



Daniel: Now you're filming?
Randy: Dan, this is so wild.



<i>Jeff: Daniel began</i>
<i>hanging out with his manager,</i>
<i>Randy kemper.</i>



<i>And was smoking</i>
<i>a lot of marijuana.</i>



<i>And he would not perform live.</i>



<i>Everybody was bugging him</i>
<i>to play live, but he just</i>
<i>didn't want to.</i>



<i>There were some changes</i>
<i>in his behavior</i>



<i>and we didn't really</i>
<i>quite know what was</i>
<i>going on with him.</i>



<i>Randy: You know, when you do</i>
<i>stuff like that,</i>
<i>you throw me off, Daniel.</i>



<i>Kathy: I always kind of</i>
<i>imagined Daniel performing</i>
<i>like Elton John</i>



with costume changes
and rockettes



and a big grand piano.
Just the kind of show
that's just ridiculous.



Almost like Andy Kaufman-esque
kind of thing.



But unfortunately,
he had his mental breakdown.



¶(Sweet loaf <i> playing)</i>



<i>Louis: So he goes to</i>
<i>a butthole surfers show</i>



<i>and somebody there</i>
<i>gives him a hit of acid.</i>



<i>And the trip really begins</i>
<i>to change everything.</i>



Again, one of the classic
scenarios of Daniel's life



is whenever anything
starts getting really good,



you know something
really ugly is gonna happen.



(Mechanical whirring)



(Groans)



Gibby: The night in question
is September 11, 1986



on which Daniel



had a bad experience, uh,



and I guess, uh, he was
under the influence



of some sort of
psychoactive substance.



(Whirring)



<i>You know, I remember</i>
<i>a little bit about seeing</i>
<i>Daniel that night.</i>



I remember him being
sort of difficult
to deal with.



And then we had
our thing going on and



<i>everybody started saying,</i>
<i>"Daniel's freaked out.</i>



<i>"Daniel's freaked out.</i>
<i>Daniel's freaked out."</i>



I'm coming back
to tell you, man.



I'm serious like Billy Graham.
Nothing like Billy Graham.



Or nothing like that.
Or nothing like nobody you
ever heard tell about nothing.



But I'm coming back
and I'm telling you
there's a supernatural world.



There's a supernatural world



and gibby,
gibby knows about it.



(Feuerzeig speaking)



(Chuckling)
No. I didn't give
him any LSD.



<i>I think at that point it was</i>
<i>pretty much known that, uh,</i>
<i>he was not necessarily</i>



<i>"an" unstable character,</i>
<i>but slightly unstable</i>
<i>"of" character.</i>



So that's the kind of person
you really wouldn't want to
engage in the, uh...



In the LSD experience.



Randy: Are you
Daniel johnston?



I used to be Daniel johnston.



And who are you now?



You know, I don't know.
I don't know.



<i>Jeff: In December of 1986,</i>



<i>Daniel was taking</i>
<i>a lot of acid and was</i>
<i>just not himself.</i>



<i>Was very, very delusional.</i>



<i>And there was one violent</i>
<i>incident with his manager</i>
<i>in which he attacked him</i>



<i>and, uh, put him</i>
<i>in the hospital</i>
<i>with a concussion.</i>



(Police siren blaring)



<i>(Daniel speaking)</i>



Dan was imagining
all kinds of things



and he thought of himself
as God's man



<i>to straighten things up</i>
<i>and so caused</i>
<i>a lot of trouble.</i>



All the family met
together for Christmas.



Mom and dad couldn't
come that year
and so we had decided



<i>since all of the siblings</i>
<i>were in Texas, that we would</i>



<i>get together</i>
<i>and have Christmas.</i>



So we're all making these
Christmas ornaments and
his Christmas ornament



is this black number nine.



<i>We asked and said,</i>
<i>"Dan, that's not an</i>
<i>appropriate Christmas symbol.</i>



<i>"What does that mean?</i>
<i>And why are you doing black?</i>



<i>"That's not gonna look good</i>
<i>hanging on the tree."</i>



<i>Dick: I remember staring</i>
<i>at him while we were</i>
<i>talking and saying,</i>



<i>"that doesn't even</i>
<i>look like Dan."</i>



<i>His face doesn't</i>
<i>look like Dan to me.</i>



<i>He was in some kind</i>
<i>of manic state.</i>



<i>We get up for a family portrait</i>



<i>and he would hang</i>
<i>a Beatles album on</i>
<i>a Christmas tree.</i>



<i>Well, I went to take it down</i>
<i>off the tree</i>
<i>and he came for me.</i>



<i>And he had super strength.</i>



And in just
a very brief struggle,
he broke my rib.



So they were
rolling around
on the floor



and it was just



not the way
our Christmas gatherings
usually are.



<i>He was talking</i>
<i>in different voices</i>



<i>and was accusing us</i>
<i>of teaching the children</i>
<i>satanist practice.</i>



<i>And that whole night we</i>
<i>didn't wanna go to sleep</i>



<i>because if he believed</i>
<i>we were satanists,</i>



<i>he might try to do</i>
<i>something to harm us</i>



if he's the "hero of good"
or something.



<i>Dick: He decided</i>
<i>to make a dash</i>



<i>to go up to the attic space</i>
<i>where the kids were playing.</i>



<i>And at that point,</i>
<i>Sally went to the phone</i>
<i>and called the police.</i>



<i>Sally: We had to call</i>
<i>for some assistance and</i>



<i>remove him from the house.</i>
<i>And my husband took him</i>
<i>to the bus station</i>



<i>and then stayed and watched</i>
<i>to make sure he got on it,</i>



<i>so that we would all feel safe.</i>



<i>Dick: I remember</i>
<i>going upstairs with Margie</i>



and laying down on the bed
and we just both wept



like he was dead, you know.
Because we didn't know
who he was.



<i>Daniel:</i>
<i>¶ Rudolph the red nosed</i>
<i>reindeer ¶</i>



<i>¶ you'll go down in history ¶</i>



<i>¶ yeah! ¶</i>



<i>(Daniel speaking)</i>



I'm lying in bed.
I have pneumonia.



And the phone rings and I
have like a 103 temperature
and the phone rings



and somebody says, uh,
"do you know
a Daniel johnston?"



I go, "yeah, Daniel
and I are friends."



He goes,
"well, I think maybe
you should come here."



I go, "well,
I really don't think
I should. I'm sick."



"No. I really, really think
you should come here."



I get to campus. I have
a 103 degrees temperature.



It's 1986 and it's Christmas,
so there's nothing there.



There's no cars.
There's no people.



This campus is
completely empty.



It's weird.
It's eerie. It's quiet.



These people I don't know
are leading me down
and we start walking down



to go towards the river.



And we look over
and there's the water.



And there standing
in the middle of the water
is Daniel.



And he's standing
in the water,
he's about knee-deep,



splashing the water,
and he's looking at us,
his eyes are like white.



At one point he looks up
and starts singing,



¶ running water,
running water ¶



and then he's preaching.
And he's talking about
baptism.



And he's talking about evil.
He's really whacked.



We're tryin' to talk him
into coming onto the shore.



It's going on and on and on
and it's getting real weird.



All of a sudden,
we look over there.



A couple of police cars
have pulled up.



<i>They forced me out,</i>
<i>they came...</i>



<i>People were...</i>
<i>People were afraid.</i>



<i>They were afraid</i>
<i>to come up to me.</i>



<i>They didn't want me</i>
<i>to splash them with water.</i>



<i>What was I doing down there?</i>
<i>What was going on?</i>



<i>I knew exactly</i>
<i>what was going on.</i>



<i>I wanted to take my life</i>
<i>only a few nights before.</i>



<i>I hit my best friend</i>
<i>over the head with</i>
<i>a lead pipe.</i>



<i>I thought there was</i>
<i>nowhere to go.</i>



<i>I thought the military</i>
<i>takeover was going to happen</i>
<i>over Christmas time.</i>



<i>But it didn't.</i>
<i>You know what I mean?</i>



<i>I thought, I knew, I saw.</i>
<i>I knew, I saw.</i>



<i>I went inside</i>
<i>the building of u.T.</i>



<i>I saw... I saw the things,</i>
<i>the programming,</i>



<i>the confusion,</i>
<i>the coke, Coca-Cola,</i>



<i>the snickers, all the candy,</i>



<i>and everything being used</i>
<i>as a drug, the confusion,</i>
<i>the mind control,</i>



<i>spiritualism,</i>
<i>the cultural upheaval, flip.</i>



<i>Man, yes, it's really</i>
<i>happening. They were</i>
<i>really doing it, man.</i>



<i>I'm talking, if you don't</i>
<i>know about it. I'm talking</i>
<i>like Nazi Germany.</i>



All great artists are crazy,



but there's a difference
between the abstract
great artist being crazy



and this person doing
damage to you or to himself,



and how involved
do you wanna be?



<i>We'd spent our whole lives,</i>
<i>we're those kind of people</i>



<i>who love the notion</i>
<i>of the crazy artist.</i>



<i>You know, van gogh</i>
<i>cutting off his ear.</i>



<i>And we've read those books</i>
<i>and we've, you know,</i>
<i>collected the art</i>



<i>and we've seen the movies</i>
<i>and we really loved</i>
<i>the crazy people</i>



<i>because they were</i>
<i>the pure people.</i>



<i>You know, they didn't have</i>
<i>any commercial sense.</i>



<i>And yet, he was</i>
<i>a real sick person.</i>



<i>And it was really,</i>
<i>"what are we gonna do?"</i>



And so, I mean, we do
the most pedestrian thing
possible.



We commit him.



And you actually felt, I mean,
a certain amount of guilt.



I mean, it was like,
if I was around van gogh...



You know, I've always had
contempt for those people



who didn't understand genius,



and here I am given my shot
and what I'm saying is,



please put him in the hospital
'cause we don't wanna
have to deal with him.



We don't know what to do.



When I went to see him
in the hospital,
they wanted to know



what my relationship
with Daniel was.



And I had been working
informally as his publicist.



But, um, I needed
to tell them something
a little better than that.



And I assumed
that Randy kemper,



after having been
beat over the head
with a lead pipe



did not wanna continue
managing Daniel.



So I said I was his manager.



<i>Jeff: I helped get Daniel</i>
<i>out of the hospital</i>



<i>because I didn't</i>
<i>fully understand</i>
<i>why he was there.</i>



<i>All I knew was he needed</i>
<i>to get out of there.</i>



<i>And as soon as I did get him</i>
<i>out, I began hearing from</i>
<i>other people asking me,</i>



<i>why did I do that.</i>



<i>But it seemed like he was</i>
<i>doing well enough.</i>



<i>He was back in his home.</i>



<i>And it seemed like</i>
<i>everything was okay, although</i>
<i>it was very borderline.</i>



It's like true
in science fiction



and it's the new
supernatural age,



you know, they spoke
of in <i> revelations.</i>



And <i> number nine, number nine,</i>
the Beatles' song,
<i>number nine.</i>



<i>Jeff: He was obsessed</i>
<i>with the devil and Satan.</i>



Daniel: Do not
get that number, 6-6-6.



Do not get 6-6-6
imprinted on your hand.



<i>Jeff: I had never really</i>
<i>heard him talk about</i>
<i>the devil before,</i>



<i>and he became so obsessed</i>
<i>that it was all he could</i>
<i>talk about.</i>



You must not give in
to the devil,
ladies and gentlemen.



The world in confusion,
ladies and gentlemen.



Somebody is
manufacturing these.



They're spreading those around.



They might be
mounting them up around.



Evil, ladies and gentlemen,
evil.



<i>Jeff: Over the next few days,</i>



<i>he began to throw literally</i>
<i>everything he owned away.</i>



<i>He threw all his drawings away.</i>



<i>He threw master tapes away.</i>



<i>And he was down to just</i>
<i>three of four possessions</i>



<i>the last time I went</i>
<i>to his apartment.</i>



<i>He still had his tape deck.</i>



<i>He still had his guitar</i>
<i>and maybe one or two</i>
<i>other things.</i>



<i>And as soon as I saw this,</i>



<i>my immediate fear was that</i>
<i>he's gonna kill himself.</i>



It's better to die,
ladies and gentlemen.



And live forever.



And that is
what I intend to do.



<i>Jeff: I went home that night,</i>
<i>not knowing what to do.</i>



Daniel: The world is
turning to hell.



<i>I did not know very much</i>
<i>about his relationship</i>
<i>with his family,</i>



<i>but I figured</i>
<i>they need to know this.</i>



<i>And I called his father</i>
<i>that night</i>



<i>and he was in Austin</i>
<i>within 24 hours.</i>



He was thin as a rail
and losing weight



and, uh, all kinds of things.



His depression finally
caught up with him.



Evil!



<i>Bill: Because he,</i>
<i>he was losing it.</i>



Number nine.



<i>Jeff: When Daniel's father</i>
<i>took him back</i>
<i>to West Virginia,</i>



<i>Daniel announced</i>
<i>his retirement.</i>



<i>And instantly became</i>
<i>a living legend in Austin.</i>



<i>He pretty much spent</i>
<i>the entire year of 1987</i>
<i>on medication.</i>



(Female interviewer speaking)



A little tired.



<i>Bill: Haldol is</i>
<i>a control drug, and at times</i>
<i>he was a vegetable.</i>



<i>Mabel: And we finally talked</i>
<i>to the psychiatrist</i>



<i>and she said she would have</i>



<i>a psychiatrist examine him.</i>



<i>Bill: They wire your brain up</i>
<i>and make sure you got</i>
<i>what your brain activity is,</i>



<i>and check if there is</i>
<i>any brain damage or anything.</i>



<i>And he checked out okay.</i>



<i>But, uh, we took</i>
<i>him to the university</i>
<i>of Pittsburgh...</i>



<i>Mabel:</i>
<i>Psychiatric institute.</i>



<i>They had, uh,</i>
<i>seven people interview him</i>
<i>for a whole day.</i>



The reason...



Um...



They said he's
on the wrong medicine.



Yeah.



<i>Every medicine</i>
<i>he reacted different to.</i>



<i>And we kept trying,</i>
<i>and we tried,</i>
<i>and tried different ones.</i>



(Female interviewer speaking)



¶(Singing)



<i>Jeff: He literally spent</i>
<i>the entire year in bed.</i>



<i>He calls it</i>
<i>his "lost year."</i>



During this period,
I was continuing to work on
building his relationships



<i>with bands like sonic youth</i>
<i>and Jad fair of half Japanese.</i>



<i>I had become friends</i>
<i>with Steve shelley</i>
<i>of sonic youth.</i>



<i>Steve turned a lot of people</i>
<i>on to Daniel's music.</i>



<i>And as Daniel finally started</i>
<i>to show some improvement,</i>



<i>Steve invited him</i>
<i>to New York City</i>



<i>to check out a recording</i>
<i>studio, just basically</i>
<i>to hang out a little bit,</i>



<i>get to know each other</i>
<i>and have some fun.</i>



<i>Daniel: We're on our way</i>
<i>to the studio.</i>



<i>Jeff: One day he's scheduled</i>
<i>to do some recording</i>
<i>at noise New York,</i>



<i>with Steve and Lee</i>
<i>from sonic youth.</i>



<i>And he's just as happy</i>
<i>as can be, joking around,</i>



<i>talking about making movies.</i>
<i>He says he's gonna</i>
<i>make a movie someday</i>



<i>and all he has to do</i>
<i>is act naturally.</i>



(Daniel speaking)



<i>Jeff: He's there to become</i>
<i>famous. That is his one</i>
<i>and only goal in his mind.</i>



How has New York been
for the last two days?



It's the greatest city
on the earth.



This is day number three
for you here.
Yeah, it's happening for sure.



If I can make it here,
I can make it anywhere, right?



That's what they say.



<i>Jeff: There were two</i>
<i>primary goals of this trip.</i>



<i>One was to, uh, meet Kramer</i>



<i>and check out</i>
<i>the noise New York</i>
<i>recording studio,</i>



<i>with the possibility of</i>
<i>recording for shimmy disc.</i>



<i>And the other was</i>
<i>to do some recording</i>
<i>with moe Tucker,</i>



<i>the drummer for</i>
<i>the velvet underground.</i>



<i>This session was</i>
<i>put together by Jad fair.</i>



<i>And this would allow</i>
<i>Daniel to meet Jad</i>
<i>for the first time.</i>



<i>¶(Music playing)</i>



As Daniel's manager, I'm
in touch with Steve shelley
on a nightly basis.



And all of a sudden,
one night I get a call



that Daniel has been
arrested that day.



<i>It seems that they decided</i>
<i>to take him to</i>
<i>the statue of liberty.</i>



<i>And while Daniel was touring</i>
<i>the statue of liberty,</i>



<i>like any tourist would want to,</i>



<i>he apparently was</i>
<i>drawing graffiti</i>
<i>inside the stairwell.</i>



<i>Christian fish.</i>
<i>Hundreds of them,</i>
<i>from what I understand.</i>



I guess it's
the anti-Satan symbol. Um...



<i>(Police officer speaking)</i>



<i>(Daniel speaking)</i>



<i>Jeff: A couple days after</i>
<i>that, there's a bizarre gig</i>
<i>at pier platters.</i>



<i>I say bizarre because he's</i>
<i>proselytizing the audience.</i>



<i>Trying to force</i>
<i>his religious beliefs</i>
<i>on the audience, basically.</i>



Jesus Christ is number seven.



Satan is number six.



Number eight is eternal death.



And number nine, number nine,
number nine,



is the human number.



Remember these things
and don't listen to the lies
that people will tell you.



Number seven is Jesus Christ.



<i>Jeff: When Daniel performed</i>
<i>at pier platters,</i>



<i>it was like the cream</i>
<i>of the crop of the New York</i>
<i>underground music scene.</i>



<i>During the song</i> funeral home,
<i>he actually gets the audience</i>
<i>to sing along with him.</i>



<i>So you've got everybody</i>
<i>singing along about going to</i>
<i>the funeral home and dying.</i>



<i>¶ I'm going to the funeral</i>
<i>and I'm never coming back ¶</i>



<i>sing along with us, won't you?</i>



<i>All:</i>
<i>¶ funeral home ¶</i>



<i>¶ funeral home ¶</i>



<i>louder.</i>



<i>¶ Going to that funeral home ¶</i>



<i>¶ got me a coffin ¶</i>



<i>¶ shiny and black ¶</i>



<i>¶ I'm going to the funeral ¶</i>



<i>¶ and I'm never coming back ¶</i>



<i>¶ got me a coffin ¶</i>



<i>¶ shiny and black ¶</i>



<i>¶ I'm going to the funeral ¶</i>



<i>¶ and I'm never coming back ¶</i>



(audience clapping)



<i>¶ Funeral home ¶</i>



<i>¶ funeral home ¶</i>



<i>¶ funeral home ¶</i>



(audience applauding)



<i>Jeff: It became more and more</i>
<i>fanatically religious</i>
<i>as the show went on.</i>



<i>He has a bit of a breakdown,</i>
<i>starts crying at one point,</i>



<i>and is just obviously</i>
<i>right on the edge.</i>



<i>And it was my belief</i>
<i>and the belief of others</i>
<i>around him</i>



<i>that things were getting</i>
<i>a little bit out of control.</i>



<i>¶ You'll be called</i>
<i>to meet your God ¶</i>



<i>¶ careless soul ¶</i>



<i>¶ oh, heed the warning ¶</i>



<i>¶ for your life ¶</i>



<i>¶ will soon be gone ¶</i>



<i>Jeff: The concert made</i>
<i>everyone feel very awkward.</i>



<i>And after the show,</i>
<i>walking back to Steve's place,</i>



<i>Daniel and Steve had</i>
<i>a bit of a falling out.</i>



<i>(Daniel speaking)</i>



<i>(Steve speaking)</i>



He told Kramer that if he
can't get anywhere, he was
gonna sleep in my hallway.



Lee: Yeah, but that's
just an idle threat.



Thurston: When's
the next train to...



I mean, I can't
imagine him staying
in the bus station,



and actually getting
on the bus all by himself.



<i>Jeff: I know the members</i>
<i>of sonic youth were</i>
<i>looking all over for Daniel.</i>



<i>He had been spotted</i>
<i>in various places,</i>



<i>and they just felt this</i>
<i>responsibility to his parents</i>
<i>to get him home.</i>



Lee: Keep an eye peeled
for Daniel.
He might just be a...



If you see a wandering guy
in white.



<i>Jeff: Steve didn't</i>
<i>really want to deal with it.</i>



<i>So Lee and thurston were</i>
<i>driving around,</i>
<i>driving around.</i>



<i>They finally spotted him</i>
<i>in a hotel parking lot,</i>
<i>I believe in Jersey.</i>



Thurston: There he is.
Lee: Really?



Yeah. He's walking over here.



Let's go get him.



Steve is totally,
totally pissed off.
Daniel: He's freaked out.



Yeah, he's freaked out
and he's not gonna...



He was gonna call my parents
and my parents will put me
in a mental home.



Lee: The best thing to do
at this point,
you have a bus ticket,



I think you should
use it.
I'm not going home.



I'm on a mission from God
and I have two more weeks
to spend in this town.



The situation here
for you now is not
the best that it could be.



And we really don't know
what to do,



I mean, you're
a long way from home,



and we don't...



Listen, I called my manager



and I started to
talk to him about it
and was I going to...



Jeff?
Yeah, I was
going to warn him



not to say anything
to my parents.



I was going to say,
"if you say anything
to my parents,



"I'm gonna fire you."



And I was saying,
"this is a warning
and this is a threat."



And he says,
"I don't wanna hear
any of your damn threats."



And he hung up on me.
My manager.



Now, don't you see the devil?
The devil Satan



is trying to stop me
from staying in this town?



Don't you see
how clear that is?



<i>Jeff: He just would</i>
<i>not go home</i>



<i>and was determined</i>
<i>to stay in New York.</i>



<i>He ended up on the bowery,</i>
<i>in a men's shelter,</i>



<i>where he was assaulted</i>
<i>once or twice,</i>
<i>lost some possessions.</i>



<i>(Daniel speaking)</i>



<i>Jeff: At this point, Daniel</i>
<i>is homeless and hungry and</i>
<i>having the time of his life</i>



<i>while everybody else</i>
<i>is completely freaked out.</i>



<i>His parents, myself, his hosts.</i>



<i>We don't know what to do,</i>
<i>whereas Daniel doesn't even</i>
<i>realize there's a problem.</i>



<i>Finally, a couple of friends</i>
<i>made arrangements to take him</i>
<i>to the bus station,</i>



<i>to buy him a ticket</i>
<i>to go back home.</i>



<i>They thought they saw him</i>
<i>getting on the bus.</i>



<i>The next thing they know,</i>
<i>two days later, Daniel is</i>
<i>spotted back in New York City.</i>



<i>He'd spent some time</i>
<i>in bellevue, a day or two,</i>



<i>was released due to</i>
<i>a clerical error and actually</i>
<i>opened for firehose</i>



<i>at cbgb's that night.</i>



<i>¶(Daniel singing)</i>



<i>Jeff: After the cbgb's gig,</i>
<i>he did his two songs and left.</i>



<i>All anybody could</i>
<i>think of was we've got</i>
<i>to get him home</i>



<i>before he either kills</i>
<i>somebody or gets killed.</i>



<i>His goal in New York</i>
<i>was to become famous.</i>



<i>And I think he accomplished</i>
<i>his goal by the time he left.</i>



<i>People:</i>
<i>¶ at the cross</i>
<i>at the cross ¶</i>



<i>Jeff: When Daniel returned</i>
<i>home from New York,</i>



<i>he was hospitalized</i>
<i>almost immediately and let out</i>
<i>way too soon in my opinion.</i>



<i>(Mabel speaking)</i>



<i>(Daniel speaking)</i>



<i>Jeff: Just a few weeks later</i>
<i>he traveled to Maryland</i>
<i>to record with Jad fair.</i>



<i>David fair: Putting Jad</i>
<i>and Daniel together</i>
<i>was... was...</i>



<i>I mean, I think</i>
<i>they're both geniuses.</i>



<i>So if you put them together,</i>
<i>you know, I don't see</i>
<i>how that could miss.</i>



I think you get like two,



you know, two giants together



and, um, it's gigantic.



<i>¶ If I'd only known</i>
<i>I could have said</i>
<i>something sooner ¶</i>



<i>¶ but I didn't, so I didn't</i>
<i>and now it's done ¶</i>



<i>¶ the last thing I'd do</i>
<i>was the first thing you did ¶</i>



<i>¶ what we once had</i>
<i>is all gone ¶</i>



<i>David fair: He had</i>
<i>a white t-shirt on</i>



<i>or white painter pants</i>
<i>maybe or something, he has...</i>



Actually he was dressed
all in white.
All white.



During that time period.



He... he thought it would be
the Christian thing to do,
to dress in white.



Yeah.



<i>Jad: David invited Daniel</i>
<i>and... and me to his home</i>
<i>to have dinner.</i>



<i>Back then, the movie, uh,</i>
my dinner with Andre
<i>was very popular.</i>



<i>And we decided,</i>
<i>well, let's have</i>
my dinner with Daniel,



<i>and film that.</i>



<i>And we'll just be</i>
<i>talking during dinnertime.</i>



Daniel: So I went to college
right across the river from
where the funeral home is.



There was this girl there,
and as soon as I saw her,
you know,



I swear to God, it looked like
she was glowing, you know.



<i>Jad: Daniel wanted to,</i>
<i>uh, direct.</i>



Stand right there,
the cameraman,
and you sit in the chair.



<i>He had very</i>
<i>specific ideas</i>
<i>for everything.</i>



<i>David fair: You know,</i>
<i>he would figure out shots,</i>
<i>he'd change angles.</i>



<i>I mean, at the beginning</i>
<i>of the evening it was</i>
<i>a film I had in mind.</i>



<i>Very soon it became,</i>
<i>you know,</i>
<i>somebody else's film.</i>



Film the... the chair, okay?



<i>The highlight probably, though,</i>



<i>was when Daniel</i>
<i>started playing the songs.</i>



<i>I mean, at one point</i>
<i>when he started weeping,</i>
<i>you know, this is...</i>



<i>You know,</i>
<i>wh-where are you gonna see</i>
<i>a performance like that?</i>



¶ I saw my own heart laying ¶



¶ black with blood ¶



¶ don't play cards with Satan ¶



¶ he'll deal you ¶



¶ an awful hand ¶



<i>David fair:</i>
<i>When we dropped him off</i>
<i>at the bus station,</i>



<i>I... I don't think anything</i>
<i>really seemed strange.</i>



<i>I don't think</i>
<i>he seemed different</i>



<i>from how he had been</i>
<i>all week long.</i>



<i>Jad: He had a ticket</i>
<i>to go to his parents' home,</i>



<i>in Chester, uh, West Virginia,</i>



<i>which is only about</i>
<i>a five-hour, uh, bus ride.</i>



<i>And we... we thought</i>
<i>he'd be fine.</i>



<i>¶(Instrumental of</i>
don't play cards with Satan
<i>playing)</i>



<i>Jeff: Just some great,</i>
<i>great music and art</i>
<i>came out of this week.</i>



<i>But unfortunately,</i>
<i>he went off his meds again</i>



<i>and had problems when he left.</i>



<i>He took a bus back</i>
<i>to West Virginia,</i>



<i>got off a little too soon</i>
<i>and was completely delusional,</i>



<i>thought that everybody</i>
<i>was possessed by Satan.</i>



<i>It was very early</i>
<i>in the morning, maybe 6:00,</i>
<i>7:00 in the morning.</i>



<i>He was making noise</i>
<i>in the street.</i>



<i>An elderly woman</i>
<i>came to her window,</i>
<i>asked him to be quiet,</i>



<i>and that set off</i>
<i>another major incident.</i>



<i>Dick: And the next thing</i>
<i>she knew,</i>



<i>he was coming up the stairs</i>
<i>in the apartment building</i>



<i>and pounding on the door.</i>



<i>And whatever he was saying</i>
<i>and whatever his demeanor was,</i>



<i>was enough to terrify her</i>
<i>such that</i>



<i>she felt like the only thing</i>
<i>she could do was jump out</i>
<i>of the second story window.</i>



<i>And, of course,</i>
<i>she broke both her ankles.</i>



(Dog barking)



And she was an elderly woman,
from church.



(Footsteps pattering)



The law pretty well takes over
when he gets into trouble.



<i>The law stepped in and, uh,</i>
<i>took Dan away from us.</i>



<i>(Daniel speaking on phone)</i>



<i>(Louis speaking on phone)</i>



<i>Jeff: He was quite busy</i>
<i>during this time</i>
<i>writing me audio letters</i>



<i>with all sorts of instructions.</i>



<i>Daniel: Earth</i>
<i>to Jeff tartakov,</i>
<i>ten four come three.</i>



<i>This is a message from</i>
<i>Daniel Dale johnston.</i>



<i>Here with a few ideas</i>
<i>I'd like to do.</i>



<i>First of all I wish</i>
<i>that the Beatles</i>
<i>would reunite</i>



<i>and back me up as a band.</i>



<i>He continued to want me</i>
<i>to get in touch with people</i>
<i>like yoko ono.</i>



<i>But he also had</i>
<i>some additional ideas.</i>



<i>He wanted to be a spokesperson</i>
<i>for Mountain dew.</i>



<i>Daniel: This is</i>
<i>Daniel johnston speaking</i>
<i>from a mental hospital.</i>



<i>They tell me I'm crazy here,</i>



<i>because I love</i>
<i>the Mountain dew so much.</i>



<i>I can't get enough</i>
<i>of the Mountain dew.</i>



<i>Daniel:</i>
<i>¶ I was sinking deep in sin ¶</i>



<i>¶ far from Mountain dew ¶</i>



<i>¶ I had problems out within ¶</i>



<i>¶ nothing that I could do ¶</i>



<i>¶ but the Mountain dew came</i>
<i>to me and I drank it all up ¶</i>



<i>¶ now I'm happy as can be,</i>
<i>oh Mountain dew ¶</i>



<i>¶ we drink Mountain dew ¶</i>



<i>¶ we drink Mountain dew ¶</i>



<i>¶ we have nothing better to do</i>
<i>but drink Mountain dew ¶</i>



<i>¶ we drink Mountain dew ¶</i>



<i>¶ we drink Mountain dew ¶</i>



<i>¶ no thing better to do</i>
<i>than to drink Mountain dew ¶</i>



<i>yahoo! Mountain dew.</i>



<i>It's the new sensation.</i>



<i>The best, the greatest,</i>
<i>the most fantastic.</i>



<i>The most sensational soda pop</i>
<i>in the cosmic universe.</i>



<i>Mountain dew!</i>



<i>(Whooping)</i>



<i>Out come the demons.</i>



<i>Demons, demons, demons,</i>
<i>drink the Mountain dew.</i>



I sent that off to
the Pepsi corporation,



but unfortunately
never got a response.



So it's 1990,
we hear Daniel's better.



We hear he's gotten...
Put on a lot of weight.



But we hear, you know,
he's doing his meds,
he's under control.



<i>So we invite him to play</i>
<i>the Austin music awards show.</i>



<i>And to come and play</i>
<i>South by southwest.</i>



<i>And everybody's</i>
<i>very excited about this.</i>



<i>Now his rep has really,</i>
<i>really grown.</i>



<i>Tartakov has really been</i>
<i>getting those tapes out there.</i>



<i>Tartakov's really working it.</i>



<i>Daniel sends me a comic,</i>



<i>about how Daniel's</i>
<i>coming back to Austin</i>
<i>to play the music awards.</i>



<i>How he's gonna get laid.</i>
<i>How all the girls should be</i>
<i>ready for him.</i>



<i>And the last page is this</i>
<i>whole thing about the devil</i>



<i>being really excited</i>
<i>that Daniel's coming back</i>
<i>to Austin,</i>



<i>'cause of all the mayhem</i>
<i>he can cause.</i>



<i>Whenever Daniel was gonna</i>
<i>perform, starting around now,</i>
<i>he went off his meds,</i>



<i>for a couple of weeks</i>
<i>before the performance.</i>



<i>Because he knew</i>
<i>the performance would be</i>
<i>better the crazier he was.</i>



The more real he was,
the better the performance
would be.



But nobody really knew this
at the time.



¶(Playing .Worried shoes)



<i>¶ I took my lucky break</i>
<i>and broke it ¶</i>



try it again.



As a professional,
you know, performer,



I haven't performed,
you know, for two years. So...



(People applauding)



I'm barely doing it now.



<i>Jeff: He flew to town</i>
<i>with his dad.</i>



<i>Did two in-store appearances</i>
<i>at record stores.</i>



<i>Hundreds and hundreds</i>
<i>of people turned out.</i>



<i>People were coming up</i>
<i>for autographs</i>



<i>and he would give them</i>
<i>so much more than just</i>
<i>an autograph.</i>



<i>He would take a full sheet</i>
<i>of paper and draw a frog,</i>
<i>an entire scene.</i>



<i>This was really</i>
<i>the highlight of my career,</i>
<i>up until that point.</i>



<i>Because I was able to see</i>
<i>an audience, a large audience,</i>
<i>respond to Daniel.</i>



<i>Palmer auditorium had</i>
<i>3,000 people there that night.</i>



¶(Running water .Playing)



<i>¶ Never knowing where you go ¶</i>



<i>¶ always running ¶</i>



<i>¶ never stopping to see</i>
<i>where you're at ¶</i>

<i>¶ what are you running from? ¶</i>



<i>¶ you always seem to be</i>

<i>¶ you always seem to be</i>

(audience applauding)



<i>Jeff: Daniel was scheduled</i>
<i>to play about a 15-minute set,</i>



<i>but he's not</i>
<i>a very good judge of time.</i>



<i>So he walked off the stage</i>
<i>after three songs.</i>



Girl: Oh, my God...



Daniel.



Dad?
Bill: Yeah?



Man: You wanna do
another, Dan?



They want me to do
another song?



Bill: You wanna go back?
Okay.



<i>Jeff: When he finally</i>
<i>came out, it was as if</i>



<i>the rolling stones had</i>
<i>come back on stage.</i>



<i>(Daniel speaking)</i>



¶(Do you really love me
<i>playing)</i>



<i>¶ But if this really is love ¶</i>



<i>¶ then let's get it on, on ¶</i>



<i>Jeff: During the song</i> do you
love me? <i> The chorus goes,</i>
do you love me now?



<i>And you could hear girls</i>
<i>in the audience screaming,</i>
<i>"yes!"</i>



<i>It was Daniel mania.</i>



<i>¶ Tell me now ¶</i>



<i>¶ do you really love me? ¶</i>



<i>¶ do you really love me? ¶</i>



<i>¶ do you really love me? ¶</i>



(audience cheering)



<i>Jeff: The audience was</i>
<i>stomping and screaming.</i>



<i>You could feel</i>
<i>the entire floor shaking.</i>



<i>¶ When they said that</i>
<i>love was dead ¶</i>



<i>¶ they were just playing</i>
<i>with your head ¶</i>



<i>¶ love is real ¶</i>



<i>¶ that's the way that I feel ¶</i>



<i>¶ I love you ¶</i>



<i>¶ do you really love me? ¶</i>



<i>¶ do you really love me? ¶</i>



<i>¶ do you really love me? ¶</i>



<i>¶ tell me now ¶</i>



(audience applauding)



<i>Thanks a lot.</i>



<i>Bill: He was</i>
<i>the hit of that show.</i>



<i>He got standing ovations.</i>
<i>Nobody else did.</i>



<i>But then, he was feeling funny.</i>



<i>And right after his</i>
<i>last performance we left.</i>



<i>We passed up interviews</i>
<i>and we left.</i>



(Engine whirring)



(Sobbing)



(Feuerzeig speaking)



Well...



It shouldn't have happened,
but Dan was secretly
duckin' his medicine.



I was giving it to him,
but he was chuckin' it.



(Feuerzeig speaking)



Captain America?



(Clears throat)



No, he thought he was Casper.
He was reading
a <i> Casper</i> comic book.



<i>There's a picture</i>
<i>on the front of the book,</i>



<i>of Casper and a parachute.</i>



<i>And Dan decided,</i>
<i>"let's... let's bail out.</i>



<i>"Let's jump out."</i>
<i>I said, "no. We can't do that.</i>



<i>"We don't have</i>
<i>any parachutes."</i>



<i>So his mind was gone.</i>



Eventually,
he took the key out,



turned the engine off,
and threw the key
out the window.



Feuerzeig: How did you
recover the flight?



Well, he grabbed the controls,
took the plane away from me.



He's stronger than me.



We were kind of
going straight up
and then straight down.



But he kind of let go
in time for me to get it
out of the spin.



Nothing down there but trees.



(Clears throat) But I'd had
training on ditching in trees,



so I didn't stall it in,



I flew it into the trees,
between two big ones.



<i>And we got out safe.</i>



<i>But the plane was a total loss.</i>



<i>The family came</i>
<i>and got us, got me.</i>



<i>We put him in a hospital</i>
<i>and left him there</i>
<i>for five months.</i>



There's Dan.
He's had a good time,



because he thought
that was great,
coming down in a spin.



He was all mixed-up.



He felt like he did
something good



and he wanted us
to be proud of him.



There's Dan being rolled into
the emergency room.



They passed a church of Christ,



and to bill and dick's
amazement,



this sign was
on the church of Christ



bulletin board out front.



"God promises a safe landing



"but not a calm voyage."

<i>(Daniel speaking)</i>



<i>¶(People singing hymn)</i>



<i>Jeff: The johnstons moved</i>
<i>to waller, Texas in late 1991</i>



<i>and I believe Daniel began</i>
<i>having some problems</i>
<i>fairly immediately</i>



<i>and ended up back</i>
<i>in the Austin state hospital.</i>



<i>During this time</i>
<i>his career continued</i>
<i>to, uh, reach for the stars.</i>



<i>Bands were covering his songs</i>
<i>left and right.</i>



<i>Kurt cobain of</i>
<i>the band nirvana wore</i>
<i>his t-shirt on mtv</i>



<i>at the mtv music awards show</i>



<i>which was seen</i>
<i>by millions of people.</i>



<i>He had had the shirt</i>
<i>for a few months.</i>



<i>Apparently, a writer</i>
<i>that I had given the shirt to,</i>



<i>a guy named Everett true,</i>
<i>had given it to Kurt.</i>



<i>And the next thing you know,</i>
<i>he's wearing it</i>
<i>not only on national TV</i>



<i>but everywhere he goes.</i>



<i>And over the next</i>
<i>several months, every</i>
<i>single photo shot he did,</i>



<i>he was wearing this shirt.</i>



<i>And just a tremendous amount</i>
<i>of publicity came Daniel's way</i>
<i>due to this.</i>



<i>Suddenly everybody knew</i>
<i>who Daniel was.</i>



It was just incredible
that a... a t-shirt could
fuel this kind of a frenzy.



The t-shirt had many, many
thousands of fans



that wanted to know
more about the t-shirt.



And wanted to
hear the t-shirt,
and see the t-shirt



and get to know
the t-shirt.



<i>Meanwhile, Daniel's</i>
<i>in a hospital and has</i>
<i>no idea who nirvana even is.</i>



<i>And within a matter of days,</i>



<i>I get a call from a guy</i>
<i>named Terry tolkin,</i>



<i>who's an a&r executive</i>
<i>for Elektra records.</i>



<i>And we got into</i>
<i>a long conversation that</i>
<i>ended with him saying,</i>



<i>"well, I'd really</i>
<i>like to sign Daniel."</i>



<i>Terry and I met for</i>
<i>a couple of days, hung out</i>
<i>and discussed, uh, everything</i>



<i>that needed to be discussed.</i>



<i>And then it was time to</i>
<i>take him over to the hospital</i>
<i>and meet with Daniel.</i>



<i>And we sat in the waiting room,</i>



<i>Daniel came out, and we had</i>
<i>a business meeting for</i>
<i>about 30, 45 minutes,</i>



<i>and it went as well as</i>
<i>a meeting can possibly go</i>
<i>in a mental institution</i>



<i>between a vice president</i>
<i>of a record label</i>
<i>and a patient.</i>



<i>We were trying to</i>
<i>structure a contract</i>



<i>that took his</i>
<i>delicate situation</i>
<i>into consideration.</i>



<i>It's not every day that</i>
<i>a major label signs somebody</i>



<i>who's in a mental institution.</i>



<i>They were looking out</i>
<i>for Daniel's best interests.</i>



<i>There was a clause in there</i>
<i>about his mental health,</i>
<i>about providing a doctor,</i>



<i>about how he would</i>
<i>never have to tour,</i>



<i>about how he could</i>
<i>never be dropped for</i>
<i>failure to promote a record.</i>



<i>And they looked at it</i>
<i>as a long-term project.</i>



<i>It wouldn't be</i>
<i>just one record,</i>
<i>it would be a career.</i>



<i>It was probably the most</i>
<i>one-sided contract in</i>
<i>the favor of artists' rights</i>



<i>that had ever been drawn up,</i>
<i>up until that time.</i>



<i>We obviously had to</i>
<i>get Daniel well, get him</i>
<i>out of the hospital.</i>



<i>And over the next few months,</i>
<i>Daniel continued to improve,</i>



<i>but it was very slow.</i>



<i>We bided our time,</i>
<i>did what we could for him</i>



<i>and just kept waiting</i>
<i>for the day</i>
<i>when he would be released.</i>



<i>Yves beauvais of</i>
<i>Atlantic records contacted me</i>
<i>around that time,</i>



<i>wanting to know</i>
<i>what was Daniel's situation.</i>



<i>And I told him,</i>
<i>"well, we're fairly close</i>
<i>to signing with Elektra."</i>



<i>His boss, Danny goldberg,</i>
<i>who was the head</i>
<i>of Atlantic records,</i>



<i>formerly worked with</i>
<i>Kurt cobain as their manager.</i>



<i>And he, uh, wasn't familiar</i>
<i>with Daniel's music,</i>



<i>but he certainly knew</i>
<i>who the guy</i>
<i>in the t-shirt was.</i>



And the next thing you know,
I've got a bidding war
on my hands.



Daniel's in a mental hospital



<i>and I've got two major labels</i>
<i>trying to outbid each other.</i>



<i>Suddenly, we're looking</i>
<i>at a $100,000 possibility.</i>



<i>Once Daniel was released</i>
<i>from the hospital, I was</i>
<i>trying to get help for him.</i>



<i>I was working with his</i>
<i>parents, trying to make</i>
<i>doctor's appointments for him.</i>



<i>And Daniel thought he was</i>
<i>fine. He did not want to</i>
<i>see the doctor.</i>



<i>And Elektra wanted him</i>
<i>to sign this contract</i>



<i>and Daniel was</i>
<i>paranoid about that.</i>



He was afraid that
Elektra was satanic.



Um, they had a band
on their roster
called metallica.



<i>He was concerned that</i>
<i>they were going to</i>
<i>beat him and kill him.</i>



<i>And, uh, he could not be</i>
<i>convinced that he was safe.</i>



<i>(Daniel speaking)</i>



His delusions would
just not go away.



He was convinced
that Elektra was evil
and that I was evil.



Elektra had to be evil
because they were tied to me.



<i>And so the deal died.</i>



<i>And this was the deal</i>
<i>I had been working</i>
<i>for seven years for.</i>



<i>This is the deal</i>
<i>I had been working for</i>
<i>30 something years for.</i>



<i>It was what I had been</i>
<i>building towards</i>
<i>my whole life.</i>



Jeffrey tartakov is
really a lot like
<i>Broadway Danny rose.</i>



Have you ever seen that movie?



<i>This guy loves his acts.</i>



Never took a lesson.



<i>Kathy: He lives to</i>
<i>make them successful.</i>



<i>And that's the way Jeff</i>
<i>always was with Daniel.</i>



<i>Jeff literally was like that</i>
<i>old time kind of manager</i>



<i>you hear about,</i>
<i>and you read about,</i>
<i>and people make movies about.</i>



<i>This sort of person who lived</i>
<i>for the good of his client.</i>



The man would be
perfect for your room.



<i>Kathy: He literally</i>
<i>devoted his life 100%</i>
<i>to Daniel johnston,</i>



<i>for all the years</i>
<i>where nothing was happening.</i>



<i>And then right when</i>
<i>Daniel was poised</i>



<i>to get an</i>
<i>international bidding war</i>
<i>on his... on his career,</i>



<i>he just completely dropped him</i>
<i>like a hot potato for</i>
<i>absolutely no reason.</i>



I gotta make a few changes.
What kind of changes?



Like management.



What do you mean "management"?



(Stammering)
Like, what do you mean
"management"?



I was fired so many times
over the years,



and over these months
specifically,



that it's hard to tell
which one actually counted.



But I continued trying
to work things out,



until I received a call one day



from a guy named tom gimbel,



<i>who informed me</i>
<i>that he was Daniel's</i>
<i>new manager.</i>



<i>I felt like a failure</i>
<i>at that time.</i>



<i>I felt like I was</i>
<i>the biggest failure</i>
<i>and loser in the world.</i>

<i>Bill: Living with Dan</i>
<i>in the same house is</i>
<i>something that is not easy</i>



<i>to get along with at times.</i>



<i>We have kind of worked out</i>
<i>a system that works</i>
<i>a little bit for us.</i>



<i>It's past noon</i>
<i>and Dan has been asleep</i>
<i>since we got up this morning.</i>



We get up about 7:00
and he's still sleeping.



That gives us that
half of the day without Dan.



And we appreciate that
as a relief because
the minute he gets up,



<i>he'll want us to make him</i>
<i>some tea, he'll want</i>
<i>something to eat,</i>



<i>he'll wanna go...</i>
<i>"Are we goin' shopping today?"</i>



<i>Every other day</i>
<i>he wants to go shopping.</i>



<i>We try to take him</i>
<i>somewhere every week.</i>



<i>And we take him</i>
<i>to church with us</i>
<i>at least once a week.</i>



<i>And we take him to the mall</i>
<i>or to a local Wal-Mart</i>
<i>once a week.</i>



<i>And then his friends come</i>
<i>to... to see him,</i>
<i>and take him to practice.</i>



<i>The band that he's working</i>
<i>with now will practice</i>
<i>once a week.</i>



<i>Daniel: Yeah, I think...</i>
<i>You wanna do it one more time?</i>



<i>Turn the...</i>
<i>Okay, that's good.</i>



<i>Testing! Okay.</i>

<i>Jason: We moved here from Ohio</i>
<i>about two and a half years ago</i>



<i>and then we were</i>
<i>driving down</i>
<i>the road one day,</i>



<i>toward my grandma's house,</i>
<i>who lives here,</i>



and, uh, we saw this guy
being attacked by dogs.



And I told bridget,
"man, this looks like
Daniel johnston.



"I... I think this is
Daniel johnston."



And, uh, she's like,
"oh, no. That's not
Daniel johnston."



So we... what we did was, um,
we stopped anyway, you know,
to help the guy out.



And bridget got out of the car
and she kicked the dog
right in the face



and it ran off.



And then, um, Daniel was like,



"hey, do you guys
play guitar?"



¶(Man obsessed <i> playing)</i>



<i>¶ He's a man obsessed ¶</i>



<i>¶ he couldn't be a lover ¶</i>



<i>¶ so now he's a pest ¶</i>



<i>¶ he played the game ¶</i>



<i>¶ but he failed the test ¶</i>



<i>¶ and now he's a pest</i>
<i>he's a pest ¶</i>



<i>¶ he's a pest ¶</i>



he said,
"well, how about, um...



"How about I come over
some time?"



And I said, "yeah, yeah.
Are you Daniel johnston?"



He's like,
"yeah. I'm Daniel johnston.
You know who I am?"



And I thought, well,
this is amazing, man.



Daniel johnston in waller.
I had no idea that
he even lived here.



<i>¶ The only way you could</i>
<i>get her to look at you</i>
<i>is to die ¶</i>



<i>¶ why don't you die? ¶</i>



<i>Jason: We got his number</i>
<i>and we called him up</i>
<i>the next week</i>



<i>and he came over to the house</i>



<i>and we recorded</i>
<i>four songs with him</i>



<i>in, like, one hour.</i>



<i>¶ He's a man obsessed ¶</i>



<i>¶ he couldn't be a lover ¶</i>



<i>¶ so now he's a pest ¶</i>



we were wondering
why we moved to waller
to begin with, you know, we...



Now we know why
we moved to waller.



You know...
Because, you know,
it was heaven sent.



<i>¶ He's a pest ¶</i>



<i>¶ he's a pest ¶</i>

Daniel started listening to
the beach boys, like, after
we played <i> pet sounds</i> for him.



I think.



He said he never heard
<i>pet sounds</i> before,



but we played it
for him one night



and he was floored by it.



And so he went out
and bought like
every beach boys record



you could possibly imagine.



<i>Jason: I don't know</i>
<i>if Brian Wilson and Daniel</i>
<i>are very much alike.</i>



<i>Every time I read</i>
<i>something about Daniel</i>
<i>in a magazine or something,</i>



<i>it mentions Brian Wilson.</i>



<i>I honestly think Daniel is</i>
<i>far more brilliant than</i>
<i>Brian Wilson is.</i>



<i>Of course the beach boys'</i>
<i>music is really far-out,</i>



<i>but, um, it's not quite</i>
<i>Daniel johnston.</i>



I read the story
of Brian Wilson
that he wrote himself.



<i>And he tells that his father</i>
<i>was not a fair manager.</i>



<i>Bill is a fair manager</i>



<i>and is not after</i>
<i>the money for himself.</i>



He's after it for Dan.



<i>Bill: Brian Wilson had</i>
<i>a lot of the similar</i>
<i>characteristics</i>



<i>and infirmities that Dan has.</i>



<i>And he went through</i>
<i>the same stages of development</i>



<i>that Dan has gone through.</i>



<i>And reading his history,</i>



<i>it smacks a whole lot of</i>
<i>exactly what's happening</i>
<i>to Dan.</i>



<i>We're learning from it.</i>
<i>We don't want to make</i>
<i>the same mistakes.</i>



Uh, he did well
actually in the end.



And we'd like Dan
to do well, too,



because he needs to.



<i>(Daniel speaking)</i>



His new songs for the movie?



(Feuerzeig speaking)



It just depends on when
he's in the mood, he will.



Yeah, I don't
even know my old songs.



Now that's the thing.



He doesn't remember
the tune and he doesn't
remember the words.



¶ I had a dream about you ¶



¶ you were the queen
of quite a few ¶



¶ and I was there
but you didn't care ¶



¶ I didn't matter somehow ¶



<i>Kathy: By the time glass eye</i>
<i>broke up in 1993,</i>



<i>Daniel was still</i>
<i>in the mental hospital.</i>



<i>And he'd been there</i>
<i>for a long time</i>
<i>and I rather thought,</i>



<i>the possibility existed,</i>
<i>sad as it was, that he might</i>
<i>never produce anything again.</i>



<i>And a lot of the music</i>
<i>that he had recorded</i>



<i>was, to the general populous,</i>
<i>unlistenable.</i>



<i>And I felt like people would</i>
<i>maybe never get him</i>



<i>and he would just be</i>
<i>like a flower that</i>
<i>bloomed in the desert,</i>



<i>you know, and was forgotten.</i>



<i>So I thought that I would</i>
<i>do some of his songs,</i>
<i>some of my favorites.</i>



<i>And do them in such a way</i>
<i>that they kind of bloomed</i>



<i>and became from like</i>
<i>say a ballpoint</i>
<i>and notepaper sketch,</i>



they kind of came into
more of a full color painting.



<i>So, I decided to</i>
<i>make the record.</i>



<i>And it was so fun</i>
<i>working with material</i>
<i>that was so good.</i>



<i>And it's probably</i>
<i>the best thing</i>
<i>I've ever done.</i>



<i>And, if I'm remembered</i>
<i>for anything ever,</i>
<i>it will be for that record.</i>



<i>Jeff: After the</i> fun
<i>and Kathy mccarty release,</i>



<i>Daniel and I did not talk</i>
<i>for four years.</i>



<i>I went into</i>
<i>such a deep depression</i>



<i>that I just wanted to have</i>
<i>nothing to do with the guy.</i>



<i>I really could not even</i>
<i>listen to his music.</i>



<i>But I still had</i>
<i>this fascination</i>
<i>with his artwork.</i>



<i>I continued to compile</i>
<i>my collection purchasing</i>
<i>drawings from other sources.</i>



How's it going?
Man: How you doing today?



Pretty good.
Seen Daniel lately?



Actually, he came by
a few months ago.



We're almost out
of what he brought us.



I'll take what I can get.
The black and white ones.



Oh, yeah, not bad at all.



<i>Jeff: I was</i>
<i>occasionally contacted by</i>
<i>galleries around the world,</i>



wanting to show his art,
and if it sounded like
a good thing,



I would help them out.



<i>We had shows in Berlin,</i>
<i>eindhoven, Paris, Barcelona,</i>



<i>London, Manchester,</i>
<i>New York City,</i>



<i>Washington D.C.,</i>
<i>Los Angeles.</i>



<i>There were really</i>
<i>more than I could count,</i>
<i>during these four years</i>



<i>that Daniel and I were</i>
<i>not even talking.</i>



<i>He was beginning to get</i>
<i>reviewed in art magazines</i>



<i>and his art was becoming</i>
<i>as well known as his music.</i>



(Phone ringing)



John: Zero one.



Uh, do we know for sure
what time Daniel's
actually gonna play?



I sort of said around 9:00.
Yeah, okay. Yeah, 9:00.



<i>We're at the corner</i>
<i>of Melrose and LA brea.</i>



<i>He's here right now.</i>



You wanna get some tape, don,
and we can get started?



<i>John: The hardest thing</i>
<i>to find in art</i>



<i>is somebody that comes up</i>
<i>with something new,</i>



<i>somebody completely original.</i>



Don: No, it's double stick,
so you can put it on the back.



Oh.



I'm not looking for people
that are part of movements
that much.



I... I'm more interested
in people who are
their own movement



or they're moving
beyond any movement.



Or, you know, are doing
things that no movement
has thought of.



<i>I think Daniel johnston</i>
<i>is his own movement.</i>



<i>He's doing things</i>
<i>as original in his way</i>



<i>as Joseph Cornell</i>
<i>did or westerman</i>



<i>or even going back</i>
<i>to marcel duchamp or man ray</i>



<i>or somebody that just</i>
<i>comes up with stuff that,</i>



<i>you know,</i>
<i>who would've thought it?</i>



<i>Well, I think it's wrong</i>
<i>to put him in that</i>
<i>outsider art thing.</i>



<i>He's as much as an inside</i>
<i>as any major artist.</i>



<i>He's just going in his</i>
<i>own direction,</i>
<i>doing his own thing,</i>



<i>which more artists should do.</i>



An unidentified collector
has just bought



98% of the show.



<i>And the show has</i>
<i>not even started yet.</i>



We've sold practically
every drawing that he brought,



except for four.
That's what happened so far.



(Stammering)
And the show has just, uh...
You know, we haven't...



Nobody's showed up yet.



You know, we're gonna
have to start taking orders,
I guess.



I mean, last year
his stuff sold pretty fast
but not this fast.



Daniel: Yeah, there are
some themes. You know,
I mean, with the artwork.



I do some captain americas,
you know, some ducks.



I do a lot of ducks
and they're like my armies



and sometimes I use them
in my battles against Satan.



<i>Jeff: Daniel's art mirrors</i>
<i>his songwriting in many ways.</i>



<i>The same characters,</i>
<i>the same themes.</i>



<i>There are plenty of drawings</i>
<i>that refer to unrequited love.</i>



<i>You'll find the same</i>
<i>characters such as Casper</i>
<i>the friendly ghost,</i>



<i>captain America.</i>
<i>Frankenstein appears</i>
<i>quite often.</i>



<i>You have Joe the boxer</i>
<i>and the eternal struggle,</i>
<i>the eternal battle.</i>



<i>For two years,</i>
<i>all Daniel drew were</i>
<i>fight scenes</i>



<i>of a boxer fighting</i>
<i>a creature in the ring.</i>



<i>The boxer clearly</i>
<i>represented Daniel while</i>
<i>the, uh, creature was evil.</i>



<i>This was</i> vile corrupt
<i>from the</i> hi, how are you
<i>album.</i>



<i>(Bell ringing)</i>



<i>(People screaming)</i>



<i>The piece titled</i>
Daniel johnston's symbolical
visions <i> is in many ways</i>



<i>the rosetta stone</i>
<i>of Daniel's art.</i>



<i>It has all the figures</i>
<i>and symbols that appear</i>
<i>in so many of his drawings.</i>



<i>From Kathy mccarty's glasses,</i>
<i>to a baby block,</i>



<i>to the man with</i>
<i>the sawed-off head, to torsos.</i>



<i>All of the familiar figures</i>
<i>are there,</i>



<i>666, eyes, the pyramid.</i>



<i>If you listen to</i>
<i>all of Daniel's music</i>
<i>and know the songs</i>



<i>and then look at the drawings,</i>
<i>they have added meaning.</i>



<i>Bill: Sometimes it's</i>
<i>very hard to fathom</i>
<i>what goes on his mind.</i>



<i>I can see what he's thinking</i>
<i>just day by day</i>
<i>in his drawings.</i>



<i>He will, uh, put captions</i>
<i>on his drawings</i>



<i>that are coming</i>
<i>right from deep inside.</i>



<i>And, uh, by looking over his</i>
<i>shoulder every day,</i>



<i>I can get a little bit</i>
<i>of what goes on in his mind.</i>



A friend of mine that saw
his art that's in the mental
health field said,



"I know Daniel's going
to heaven, he's already
been to hell."



<i>She was lookin' at</i>
<i>the artwork and she said,</i>
<i>"this is hellacious.</i>



<i>"I mean, someone tortured..."</i>
<i>And I don't even see it</i>
<i>that way.</i>



<i>A lot of his artwork I see</i>
<i>as very happy</i>



<i>and he really believes in love.</i>



<i>I think he looks for</i>
<i>that superhero idea</i>



<i>of someone's gonna rescue</i>
<i>or save and be the good guy.</i>



It's not really
a coincidence but,



I did a tribute album
of Daniel's songs



and later I went on to marry
Daniel's best friend.



<i>The very first time I went</i>
<i>to Daniel's apartment,</i>



<i>Daniel handed me</i>
<i>a book of poetry and said,</i>



<i>"oh, you might like this.</i>



<i>"These are my friend Dave's</i>
<i>poems. Why don't you</i>
<i>read them?"</i>



<i>And I loved them.</i>
<i>He was instantly</i>
<i>my favorite poet.</i>



Two or three years after
<i>dead dog's eyeball</i>
came out,



<i>Dave emailed me and said,</i>
<i>"hi, this is Dave thornberry.</i>



<i>"Do you remember me?"</i>



<i>And I wrote him back like,</i>
<i>"do I remember you?</i>



<i>"I read your poems</i>
<i>all the time, still."</i>



<i>And I went to visit him,</i>
<i>and as soon as we were</i>
<i>together,</i>



<i>it was like, we have to</i>
<i>get married. And we did.</i>



<i>And it was very romantic.</i>
<i>We got married two days</i>
<i>after we saw each other</i>



<i>for the first time in 13 years.</i>



<i>(Daniel speaking)</i>



<i>Kathy: Daniel never really</i>
<i>talked to me directly</i>
<i>about Laurie.</i>



<i>But, of course,</i>
<i>I knew that all the songs</i>
<i>were about someone.</i>



<i>I mean, I knew that he had</i>
<i>loved and lost, you know,</i>
<i>in his life.</i>



<i>And I don't think I even</i>
<i>ever really thought that</i>
<i>all those songs</i>



<i>were about the same person.</i>



<i>But after we had broke up,</i>
<i>so to speak,</i>



<i>I began to know</i>
<i>more about Laurie.</i>
<i>He talked more about Laurie.</i>



<i>And I began to know like,</i>
<i>how huge an obsession,</i>



<i>his obsession with Laurie was.</i>



¶ Love could save me somehow ¶



¶ but I just can't make it ¶



<i>Daniel: Most of my songs</i>
<i>are about her.</i>



<i>You know, because she does,</i>
<i>did, and hopefully</i>
<i>will love me,</i>



<i>you know, it keeps me goin'.</i>



<i>I'm always thinking about</i>
<i>another angle about it</i>
<i>when I'm writing a song.</i>



<i>I think art has always been</i>
<i>inspired by beauty.</i>



<i>I think there have been</i>
<i>many artists, uh,</i>
<i>throughout history</i>



<i>who had a major inspiration,</i>



<i>whether it was a girl,</i>
<i>or even just a philosophy.</i>



<i>That's what I like</i>
<i>about life and about art.</i>



<i>Is that when you write a song,</i>
<i>it's just the way</i>
<i>that you saw it</i>



<i>or just the way that it was.</i>



<i>I think art is</i>
<i>the greatest frame of mind</i>



<i>to express a certain feeling</i>
<i>and you'll always</i>
<i>have that feeling.</i>



<i>It's always there.</i>



<i>¶ So magical ¶</i>



<i>David: Laurie is... is</i>
<i>his muse but in a completely</i>
<i>passive way.</i>



<i>Laurie is the 17 syllables</i>
<i>of haiku</i>



<i>for him to hang his</i>
<i>creativity on.</i>



<i>That's what she is.</i>
<i>She's a structure</i>
<i>for him to build on.</i>



She's not
the love of his life.
I mean, but she is.



<i>Louis: When I first met</i>
<i>Daniel in '85, he was</i>
<i>burning with her.</i>



<i>I mean, she was in his eyes</i>
<i>all the time.</i>



<i>I mean, when he</i>
<i>talked about her</i>
<i>it was just intense.</i>



<i>And what's so weird about</i>
<i>Daniel is that went away</i>



<i>and it came back</i>
<i>more intense later on</i>



<i>because he realized</i>
<i>it was a really good story.</i>



<i>¶ True love will find you</i>
<i>in the end ¶</i>



<i>¶ you'll find out</i>
<i>just who was your friend ¶</i>



<i>¶ don't be sad,</i>
<i>I know you will ¶</i>



<i>¶ but don't give up until ¶</i>



<i>¶ true love will find you</i>
<i>in the end ¶</i>



<i>¶ this is a promise</i>
<i>with a catch ¶</i>



<i>¶ only if you're looking</i>
<i>can it find you ¶</i>



<i>¶ 'cause true love is</i>

<i>¶ but how can it</i>

<i>¶ unless you step out</i>
<i>into the light? ¶</i>



<i>¶ the light ¶</i>



<i>¶ don't be sad,</i>
<i>I know you will ¶</i>



<i>¶ but don't give up until ¶</i>



<i>¶ true love will find you</i>
<i>in the end ¶</i>



<i>Kathy: For as much as</i>
<i>Daniel has expanded</i>
<i>the myth of Laurie,</i>



<i>it really wasn't</i>
<i>that big of a deal,</i>



<i>except in Daniel's mind.</i>



<i>But what happened with Jeff</i>
<i>really was a big deal.</i>



<i>And as far as, like a story</i>
<i>that breaks your heart,</i>



<i>that's the story</i>
<i>that breaks my heart</i>
<i>about Daniel's life.</i>



Daniel told me that
he was sorry about the way
he had treated me



and he admitted that
I had been unjustly fired,



and he told me
that he was not right
mentally at that time.



And he really said
all the things you would
hope to hear from somebody



who had behaved
the way he had behaved.



He was very sincere



and I believe he truly felt bad



about the way things went down
between the two of us.



<i>Even though I wasn't</i>
<i>his manager, I still had</i>
<i>the back catalog</i>



<i>and I couldn't just stop.</i>



<i>It just made no sense.</i>



<i>I didn't know</i>
<i>what would happen</i>
<i>with this music.</i>



<i>It would have disappeared</i>
<i>forever. It wouldn't</i>
<i>exist today if I stopped.</i>



<i>Stress records is my baby.</i>



<i>It's a company I started</i>
<i>about 23 years ago, and today</i>
<i>it exists for the sole purpose</i>



<i>of spreading the word</i>
<i>of Daniel johnston</i>
<i>to the masses.</i>



<i>I do that by dubbing</i>
<i>his cassettes and</i>
<i>distributing them myself.</i>



<i>I advertise them</i>
<i>over the Internet.</i>



<i>I take mail orders daily.</i>
<i>I work the telephones.</i>



<i>I send them out to people</i>
<i>I know. I do everything I can.</i>



<i>¶(Music playing)</i>



<i>I do it because</i>
<i>people need to hear</i>
<i>this music.</i>



<i>The music of Daniel johnston</i>
<i>is something that I think</i>



<i>everybody needs to</i>
<i>at least be exposed to.</i>



<i>There's really nothing</i>
<i>to even to compare it to.</i>



<i>It goes way beyond</i>
<i>Dylan's basement recordings</i>
<i>or early Robert Johnson</i>



<i>or any other body of work</i>
<i>that I can think of.</i>



Daniel's been so much better
these last few years,



it's a miracle.



It's even difficult for me
to grasp the fact



<i>that he's playing</i>
<i>internationally and touring.</i>

<i>Kathy: In Daniel's life,</i>
<i>everywhere he's gone,</i>



<i>he leaves this incredible</i>
<i>wake behind of creation</i>
<i>and destruction.</i>



<i>He's done all kinds of things,</i>
<i>both bad and good,</i>



<i>but they're all mythic.</i>



<i>And they're all</i>
<i>barely believable,</i>
<i>yet they're all true.</i>



<i>And the kinds of things</i>
<i>that he's done in his career,</i>



<i>are the kinds of things</i>
<i>someone would only do</i>



<i>if they were</i>
<i>so self-sabotaging</i>



<i>that it was</i>
