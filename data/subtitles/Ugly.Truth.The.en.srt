00:00:24,448 --> 00:00:28,207
¶ Like a girl changes clothes

3
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:31,195
¶ Yeah, you PMS

4
00:00:31,204 --> 00:00:33,084
¶ Like a bitch

5
00:00:33,115 --> 00:00:35,018
¶ I would know

6
00:00:35,027 --> 00:00:38,689
¶ And you over-think

7
00:00:38,692 --> 00:00:41,679
¶ Always speak cryptically

8
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:43,600
¶ I should know

9
00:00:43,631 --> 00:00:48,402
¶ That you're
no good for me

10
00:00:48,444 --> 00:00:50,409
¶ 'Cause you're hot
Then you're cold

11
00:00:50,451 --> 00:00:52,298
¶ You're yes
Then you're no

12
00:00:52,298 --> 00:00:54,113
¶ You're in
Then you're out

13
00:00:54,148 --> 00:00:55,994
¶ You're up
Then you're down

14
00:00:56,027 --> 00:00:57,843
¶ You're wrong
When it's right

15
00:00:57,875 --> 00:00:59,691
¶ It's black
And it's white

16
00:00:59,725 --> 00:01:00,929
¶ We fight, we break up

17
00:01:01,637 --> 00:01:03,767
¶ We kiss, we make up

18
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:05,528
Are you alert?

19
00:01:05,602 --> 00:01:07,661
Okay, well tell them...

20
00:01:07,671 --> 00:01:10,605
¶ But you don't really
Want to go

21
00:01:10,828 --> 00:01:11,810
No.

22
00:01:12,652 --> 00:01:13,765
¶ You're yes
Then you're no

23
00:01:13,805 --> 00:01:16,555
¶ You're in
Then you're out

24
00:01:16,557 --> 00:01:19,490
I'll be there in about
15 minutes, so stop arguing.

25
00:01:19,533 --> 00:01:22,347
Okay, thanks. Bye.

26
00:01:24,204 --> 00:01:27,271
¶ We used to be

27
00:01:27,308 --> 00:01:30,025
¶ Just like twins
So in synch

28
00:01:30,028 --> 00:01:31,915
- Morning, Freddy.
- Morning, Abby.

29
00:01:31,948 --> 00:01:34,884
- You look awfully pretty today.
- Oh, is it that bad in there?

30
00:01:34,893 --> 00:01:36,835
- Good morning. We got problems.
- Morning.

31
00:01:36,878 --> 00:01:38,787
There are no problems, Joy,
only solutions.

32
00:01:38,829 --> 00:01:40,487
The traffic camera is down

33
00:01:40,526 --> 00:01:42,566
and we have no B-roll
for our traffic segment.

34
00:01:42,573 --> 00:01:43,587
- That is a problem.
- Yeah.

35
00:01:44,301 --> 00:01:45,250
Call Matt at Media Lab.

36
00:01:45,293 --> 00:01:46,372
He's got some Skycams
and he owes me.

37
00:01:46,414 --> 00:01:48,301
- Where are all my weathermen?
- Right here.

38
00:01:48,301 --> 00:01:49,317
- Hey.
- Hello.

39
00:01:49,358 --> 00:01:52,009
Thank you all for coming.
You guys look great.

40
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:53,900
Thanks for being here. Good.

41
00:01:53,902 --> 00:01:55,789
Is there a reason
they're all overweight?

42
00:01:55,822 --> 00:01:56,837
If they get
the forecast wrong,

43
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:58,698
research shows people
are more willing

44
00:01:58,734 --> 00:01:59,682
to forgive a fat guy.

45
00:01:59,694 --> 00:02:00,709
Abby, I hate to do this to you,

46
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,659
but I don't think that
I can work with her anymore.

47
00:02:02,703 --> 00:02:04,644
It's bad enough I have
to take her criticism at home.

48
00:02:04,686 --> 00:02:06,378
I'm not gonna
do it on the air.

49
00:02:06,414 --> 00:02:09,348
- A man can only endure so much.
- Larry, you are not a man,

50
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:11,245
you are a newsman·

51
00:02:11,278 --> 00:02:13,221
And newsmen are not defined
by the easy times,

52
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:15,205
they're defined
by the hard times.

53
00:02:15,247 --> 00:02:17,997
Can you imagine
Ted Koppel or Tom Brokaw

54
00:02:18,031 --> 00:02:20,747
working with their
wives as co-anchors? No.

55
00:02:20,783 --> 00:02:21,929
Because they
couldn't handle it.

56
00:02:21,967 --> 00:02:24,717
But you.
You, my friend,

57
00:02:24,718 --> 00:02:26,508
have balls the size
of volkswagens.

58
00:02:26,512 --> 00:02:27,591
Don't think
I haven't noticed.

59
00:02:27,631 --> 00:02:29,519
I only thought of them
as blue of late.

60
00:02:29,584 --> 00:02:31,492
But you're right.
They're quite sizeable.

61
00:02:31,536 --> 00:02:33,259
But not disproportionately
so,

62
00:02:33,264 --> 00:02:35,239
I like to think of them
as aesthetically pleasing.

63
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,069
Yeah, I think
I made my point.

64
00:02:37,103 --> 00:02:39,110
- Are you kidding me right now?
- Josh, nobody in Sacramento

65
00:02:39,151 --> 00:02:40,939
gives a crap about
the extinction rate

66
00:02:40,975 --> 00:02:42,884
of the Brazilian slug worm.
It's not newsworthy.

67
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:44,871
All right. But knowing which
celebutante is in rehab

68
00:02:44,912 --> 00:02:45,860
is of vital importance?

69
00:02:45,905 --> 00:02:47,727
You know, the sound
of your voice makes...

70
00:02:47,728 --> 00:02:48,808
Okay. He is trying to kill me.

71
00:02:48,848 --> 00:02:50,735
- He knows I can't eat crab.
- It's Crab Rangoon.

72
00:02:50,769 --> 00:02:52,623
Who doesn't eat Crab Rangoon?

73
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:55,375
Oh, my God. Does anybody
see this? Is that a hive?

74
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:56,489
Looks like syphilis to me.

75
00:02:56,497 --> 00:02:59,147
You wouldn't know
what syphilis looks like

76
00:02:59,185 --> 00:03:01,159
if it weren't for my story
on hot celebrity STDs.

77
00:03:03,185 --> 00:03:05,836
- Stand by to go to three.
- Yeah, so some...

78
00:03:05,873 --> 00:03:07,816
Cacciatore gets mushrooms,
garlic. Exactly.

79
00:03:07,856 --> 00:03:09,765
- Yeah. Put the mushrooms in.
- All right.

80
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:11,718
And whatever amount
of garlic you want.

81
00:03:11,729 --> 00:03:13,671
- Really?
- Can't have enough garlic.

82
00:03:13,712 --> 00:03:14,728
You can.

83
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,560
I certainly can.
Do it every night.

84
00:03:16,592 --> 00:03:18,382
I got a nice,
big spoon for you.

85
00:03:18,385 --> 00:03:19,497
Excellent. Thanks.

86
00:03:19,538 --> 00:03:22,254
- Here you go.
- Mm.

87
00:03:22,258 --> 00:03:24,111
- Mm!
- That good?

88
00:03:24,146 --> 00:03:25,161
I have to say, Rocco,

89
00:03:25,201 --> 00:03:27,176
this is the best chicken
cacciatore I've ever tasted.

90
00:03:27,217 --> 00:03:30,764
I knew you'd like it.
It's duck cacciatore, actually.

91
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:32,680
- Oh, no.
- Did he just say ''duck''?

92
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,762
And it's a great
alternative to chicken.

93
00:03:34,801 --> 00:03:36,743
It kind of tastes
just like chicken, right?

94
00:03:36,787 --> 00:03:39,405
- Mm-hm.
- Duck, like ''quack, quack'' duck?

95
00:03:39,411 --> 00:03:40,621
Get ready to an early break.
Yeah.

96
00:03:41,299 --> 00:03:41,549
- Whoa, duck.
- Yeah.

97
00:03:41,586 --> 00:03:43,343
Man, we're a
chicken household.

98
00:03:43,347 --> 00:03:45,201
We really are.

99
00:03:45,235 --> 00:03:47,275
Tell Larry to throw it to Javier
while she pulls it together.

100
00:03:47,283 --> 00:03:48,973
Or is it okay?

101
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:51,150
It's good.
Javier, do you like it?

102
00:03:51,187 --> 00:03:52,846
Mm.

103
00:03:52,978 --> 00:03:54,920
Can I take home
the leftovers?

104
00:03:54,932 --> 00:03:56,819
You sure you don't want
any leftovers?

105
00:03:56,852 --> 00:03:58,760
When we return,

106
00:03:58,802 --> 00:04:00,626
- our Skycam traffic update.
- Okay.

107
00:04:00,658 --> 00:04:02,514
And guess who's
in rehab this week.

108
00:04:02,548 --> 00:04:04,587
Stand by to roll break.
Also, how you too can adopt

109
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,275
your very own slug worm,
when we come back.

110
00:04:07,283 --> 00:04:08,298
Roll your break.

111
00:04:08,338 --> 00:04:10,193
How about salt?
Salt make it better?

112
00:04:13,108 --> 00:04:14,864
I don't know how you do it.

113
00:04:14,901 --> 00:04:16,843
It's just a matter of looking
chaos right in the eye

114
00:04:16,884 --> 00:04:17,995
and telling it to eff off.

115
00:04:18,036 --> 00:04:19,923
You guys did great.
Thank you.

116
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:22,603
I think it's time for a new chef
on this show. I do.

117
00:04:22,644 --> 00:04:24,466
Now, come on.
Rocco's been with us...

118
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,678
- Abby?
- It's this upsetting?

119
00:04:25,684 --> 00:04:28,269
Hey, Stuart wants to see you.
He's freaking out.

120
00:04:28,341 --> 00:04:31,375
Oh, he got the ratings.

121
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:35,187
- Want some?
- Yeah, give me that.

122
00:04:38,997 --> 00:04:41,004
Have you seen the ratings
from yesterday?

123
00:04:41,045 --> 00:04:42,954
We got beat by all
the network shows,

124
00:04:42,965 --> 00:04:44,786
including a rerun of
Who's the Boss?

125
00:04:44,821 --> 00:04:46,707
The one where
the vacuum breaks.

126
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,529
It's just a temporary setback,
Stuart.

127
00:04:48,564 --> 00:04:50,353
Things will be better
tomorrow.

128
00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:52,560
You know that guy
with the cable-access show

129
00:04:53,237 --> 00:04:55,278
on Channel 83 does better.

130
00:04:55,317 --> 00:04:57,293
If we program
Jerry Springer reruns,

131
00:04:57,334 --> 00:05:00,182
we'd do a nine-share
at a quarter of the price.

132
00:05:00,213 --> 00:05:01,141
Please don't tell me

133
00:05:01,173 --> 00:05:02,997
you're thinking
of killing the show.

134
00:05:03,029 --> 00:05:05,747
We're not a family-run station
anymore, Abby.

135
00:05:05,783 --> 00:05:08,598
I mean, I love you.
You're great at what you do.

136
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:09,742
But you gotta
get me some numbers.

137
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,598
I got two daughters in college
and a son in beauty school.

138
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:15,348
I don't know how much
you know about vidal Sassoon,

139
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:16,398
but that shit ain't cheap.

140
00:05:17,461 --> 00:05:20,245
I can rally. I will rally.

141
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:23,093
You do rally.
Every day, Abby.

142
00:05:23,095 --> 00:05:24,949
But that's
what worries me.

143
00:05:24,983 --> 00:05:26,870
That even you
won't be enough.

144
00:05:26,903 --> 00:05:28,975
I should not be letting
corporate management

145
00:05:29,014 --> 00:05:31,764
dictate the content
of this show. It's my show.

146
00:05:31,766 --> 00:05:35,476
I control it.
I should skip the date tonight.

147
00:05:35,511 --> 00:05:37,420
Stay home,
think up some ideas for sweeps.

148
00:05:37,463 --> 00:05:39,319
Absolutely not, Abby.

149
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:41,423
You should be out there
observing humanity.

150
00:05:41,463 --> 00:05:44,081
Humanity is who watches
our show.

151
00:05:44,086 --> 00:05:45,264
Yeah.
All 2.47 percent of them.

152
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:48,848
You have rescheduled
on this guy three times.

153
00:05:48,887 --> 00:05:50,797
You cancel on him tonight
and he's gone.

154
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,018
Look at this bone structure.

155
00:05:52,696 --> 00:05:54,834
This could be the bone structure
of your future children.

156
00:05:54,872 --> 00:05:56,694
Don't you want them
to be symmetrical?

157
00:05:56,728 --> 00:05:58,582
You printed out his profile?

158
00:05:58,617 --> 00:06:00,404
What? These have
not been touched

159
00:06:00,408 --> 00:06:01,423
in quite some time.

160
00:06:01,497 --> 00:06:03,471
I have to live vicariously
through your dating life.

161
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,327
And I really think that this
could be our next boyfriend.

162
00:06:07,321 --> 00:06:09,076
- Hi.
- Hello.

163
00:06:09,112 --> 00:06:11,927
I'm looking for a guy
with sandy brown hair,

164
00:06:11,928 --> 00:06:13,870
athletic build, blue eyes.
He's 5'9''.

165
00:06:13,913 --> 00:06:15,800
Which I know you're thinking
is a little short,

166
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,913
but he's read
The Great Gatsby twice...

167
00:06:16,952 --> 00:06:18,742
Well, technically
I'm 5'8'' and a half,

168
00:06:18,776 --> 00:06:20,718
but I could read
The Great Gatsby

169
00:06:20,728 --> 00:06:22,617
again if it makes
it any better.

170
00:06:24,442 --> 00:06:26,415
Hi. Can I get some water
for the table?

171
00:06:26,457 --> 00:06:28,279
Uh, yeah, a bottle
of flat water, please?

172
00:06:28,312 --> 00:06:29,295
- Sure.
- Thank you.

173
00:06:29,338 --> 00:06:31,160
Um, just one second.
I'm sorry.

174
00:06:31,194 --> 00:06:33,942
Did you know they've done
studies that show

175
00:06:33,946 --> 00:06:36,019
tap water and bottled water
are basically the same thing.

176
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:38,031
And they recently passed
a law where restaurants

177
00:06:38,042 --> 00:06:40,759
have to filter their tap water,
so it's not really tap water,

178
00:06:40,793 --> 00:06:42,615
it's filtered water,
which is the same

179
00:06:42,649 --> 00:06:44,591
except you don't have to pay
$7 for it. Right?

180
00:06:44,603 --> 00:06:46,576
I like the way
it tastes better anyway.

181
00:06:46,619 --> 00:06:49,336
Can I get a Scotch on the rocks,
please? Thank you.

182
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:50,483
Oh, yeah.

183
00:06:50,523 --> 00:06:53,370
Huh. I thought, uh...

184
00:06:53,403 --> 00:06:56,120
I thought in your profile
it said you, uh...

185
00:06:56,154 --> 00:06:57,911
You like to drink red wine.

186
00:06:59,163 --> 00:07:01,781
You printed out my profile?

187
00:07:01,819 --> 00:07:02,932
Actually,
my associate producer did.

188
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:04,826
She doesn't like me
to not be prepared.

189
00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:07,576
Not that I'm ever not prepared.
Kudos, by the way,

190
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:09,519
on your comprehensive
car insurance plan.

191
00:07:09,564 --> 00:07:11,351
That wasn't in my profile.

192
00:07:11,387 --> 00:07:13,394
No, but it's in your
background check.

193
00:07:13,403 --> 00:07:16,370
So, ahem,
tell me about yourself.

194
00:07:16,411 --> 00:07:18,101
Well, what's
left to talk about

195
00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:19,220
that you don't already know,
right?

196
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:22,009
Ah. Good point.
Ha-ha.

197
00:07:23,036 --> 00:07:24,923
All right,
well, you know,

198
00:07:24,956 --> 00:07:27,891
I actually took the liberty
of printing out

199
00:07:27,899 --> 00:07:30,747
some talking points
in case this happened.

200
00:07:30,812 --> 00:07:32,699
I take it this
has happened before?

201
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:35,350
No. No. But you have
nine out of 10

202
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:37,362
of the necessary attributes
on my checklist.

203
00:07:37,435 --> 00:07:39,379
Oh, dear God. Okay.

204
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:43,033
Oh, this is a good one.
Let's start with three, okay?

205
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:02,259
Don't ask.

206
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:12,949
More on this story
when we come back.

207
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:15,641
We'll hear from a zoo official
now forced to take...

208
00:08:15,677 --> 00:08:17,564
And we're back with
The Ugly Truth,

209
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:18,742
where tonight
we're gonna be talking about

210
00:08:19,454 --> 00:08:23,252
what it is men and women
really want in relationships.

211
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,439
I've been looking through
some books.

212
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:28,057
Smart Women,
Foolish Choices. Ehh!

213
00:08:28,095 --> 00:08:31,062
Men Who Love Women
Who Hate Them. Ehh!

214
00:08:31,103 --> 00:08:33,143
And Women Hating Men
Who Loved Women

215
00:08:33,822 --> 00:08:35,894
Who Hate Loving Men. Huh?

216
00:08:35,966 --> 00:08:41,532
Billions and billions wasted
on psychobabble bullshit.

217
00:08:41,567 --> 00:08:43,606
Now, listen up, ladies, because
I'm only gonna say this once

218
00:08:43,615 --> 00:08:46,517
and it is just
three little words.

219
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,163
Men are simple.

220
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:52,181
We cannot be trained.

221
00:08:52,224 --> 00:08:55,191
All this
''Men are from venus'' crap

222
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,014
is a waste of your time
and money.

223
00:08:58,048 --> 00:09:00,798
You wanna be a lonely hag,
then that's fine,

224
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:02,621
keep reading
these stupid books.

225
00:09:02,687 --> 00:09:06,582
But you want a relationship,
then here's how you get one:

226
00:09:06,592 --> 00:09:08,501
It's called a Stairmaster.

227
00:09:08,543 --> 00:09:11,227
Get on it, and get skinny,

228
00:09:11,232 --> 00:09:13,304
and get some trashy lingerie
while you're at it,

229
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,067
because at the end of the day,

230
00:09:15,104 --> 00:09:16,282
all we're interested
in is looks.

231
00:09:16,288 --> 00:09:18,176
And no one falls in love
with your personality

232
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:19,965
at first sight.

233
00:09:19,969 --> 00:09:22,816
We fall in love
with your tits and your ass,

234
00:09:22,849 --> 00:09:24,791
and we stick around because
of what you're willing

235
00:09:24,832 --> 00:09:26,655
to do with them.

236
00:09:26,688 --> 00:09:29,591
So you wanna win a man over,
you don't need 10 steps,

237
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,278
you need one,
and it's called a blowjob.

238
00:09:33,312 --> 00:09:34,524
And don't forget to...

239
00:09:38,336 --> 00:09:41,086
Okay? Now, let's
take the first caller.

240
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,876
How dare you burn those books.

241
00:09:42,913 --> 00:09:44,889
They've helped my personal life
more than I can say.

242
00:09:44,929 --> 00:09:46,970
What's your boyfriend's name,
princess?

243
00:09:46,977 --> 00:09:49,596
Well,
I'm not seeing anyone right now.

244
00:09:49,634 --> 00:09:51,739
My point exactly, Shrek.
Next caller.

245
00:09:51,778 --> 00:09:53,566
You're on the air.

246
00:09:53,601 --> 00:09:57,399
So you're saying that men
are incapable of love?

247
00:09:57,442 --> 00:10:00,158
Oh, did I burst your little
harlequin romance bubble?

248
00:10:00,195 --> 00:10:01,208
What? Come on.

249
00:10:01,219 --> 00:10:03,969
The only thing you burst
is your credibility.

250
00:10:04,001 --> 00:10:06,140
Men are completely capable
of experiencing love.

251
00:10:06,177 --> 00:10:08,797
Okay, I'll bite.
Go on. Who's the guy?

252
00:10:08,802 --> 00:10:10,744
- What?
- The guy. Mr. Wonderful.

253
00:10:10,787 --> 00:10:12,642
The one who's
so capable of love.

254
00:10:12,643 --> 00:10:13,820
Who is he? What's he like?

255
00:10:13,859 --> 00:10:17,600
He's smart, he's handsome
but he doesn't know it.

256
00:10:17,602 --> 00:10:21,465
He's successful, but in a job
that means something.

257
00:10:23,363 --> 00:10:25,304
He loves red wine, picnics,
classical music.

258
00:10:25,316 --> 00:10:28,097
Mm, this is a guy
in America, right?

259
00:10:28,131 --> 00:10:30,947
I mean, you're not calling
from Europe or something?

260
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,922
He loves dogs,
but he's more of a cat person.

261
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:35,778
He never gets up before you
on a Sunday morning.

262
00:10:35,812 --> 00:10:37,600
Wait a second, I get it.

263
00:10:37,635 --> 00:10:38,585
You're a lesbian.

264
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:39,644
- What?
- Well, you must be.

265
00:10:39,716 --> 00:10:42,366
I mean, you just described
the perfect woman.

266
00:10:42,403 --> 00:10:44,543
Why are you so threatened
by these qualities?

267
00:10:45,221 --> 00:10:48,123
Is it perhaps because you don't
possess a single one of them

268
00:10:48,163 --> 00:10:49,211
and that is the real reason

269
00:10:49,221 --> 00:10:51,076
why women aren't
interested in you? Hm?

270
00:10:51,107 --> 00:10:53,956
Okay. Okay, I'll give you
100 bucks of my own money

271
00:10:53,988 --> 00:10:55,931
to go get this guy
and bring him down here

272
00:10:55,972 --> 00:10:57,794
and let me meet him.

273
00:10:57,828 --> 00:11:00,676
Well, he's out there,
somewhere.

274
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:01,755
Wait a second.

275
00:11:01,797 --> 00:11:04,416
You're not even
dating this guy?

276
00:11:04,452 --> 00:11:08,347
No, I'm describing a type.

277
00:11:08,356 --> 00:11:11,139
I thought that's
what we were doing.

278
00:11:11,173 --> 00:11:13,181
Ha-ha-ha! What?
You don't even know him?

279
00:11:13,221 --> 00:11:15,938
Oh, whoa, okay,
now I get the picture.

280
00:11:15,974 --> 00:11:18,875
Hold on. Oh, you're a dog.

281
00:11:18,884 --> 00:11:19,778
What?

282
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:20,860
Well, you must be.

283
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:22,756
Come on, you heard me.
I mean, if you were...

284
00:11:22,789 --> 00:11:24,546
If you were hot,
you would be out

285
00:11:24,581 --> 00:11:26,687
breaking some poor
schmuck's heart

286
00:11:26,725 --> 00:11:29,541
instead of spending
all your time fantasizing

287
00:11:29,573 --> 00:11:31,264
about Mr. Wonderful.

288
00:11:31,302 --> 00:11:34,149
Face it, you're ugly.

289
00:11:34,374 --> 00:11:36,065
I am not ugly.

290
00:11:36,134 --> 00:11:38,022
Well, okay,

291
00:11:38,023 --> 00:11:39,070
let me help you out here.

292
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:41,924
You might as well face the fact
that you're gonna be alone,

293
00:11:41,926 --> 00:11:43,933
and stop pining away
for some fantasy guy

294
00:11:43,975 --> 00:11:44,902
you're never gonna get.

295
00:11:44,934 --> 00:11:47,652
- How can you possibly...?
- Hey, Lassie.

296
00:11:47,686 --> 00:11:49,475
The show's called
The Ugly Truth.

297
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:52,357
If you can't face it,
don't call.

298
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:53,503
That about
wraps it up for this evening.

299
00:11:53,543 --> 00:11:57,187
I'm Mike Chadway reminding you
that the truth is never pretty.

300
00:11:57,224 --> 00:11:59,077
JOY:
How'd the date go?

301
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:01,980
Well, I was very pleased
with the choice of restaurant.

302
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:03,932
- That is so awesome.
- Why?

303
00:12:03,975 --> 00:12:05,054
Good morning, everyone.

304
00:12:05,096 --> 00:12:06,787
Morning.

305
00:12:06,823 --> 00:12:08,831
Now, before I play you this,
I should warn you,

306
00:12:08,871 --> 00:12:12,515
this guy's a little rough
around the edges.

307
00:12:12,552 --> 00:12:14,657
Face it, you're ugly.

308
00:12:14,696 --> 00:12:16,583
I am not ugly.

309
00:12:16,615 --> 00:12:19,398
- Well...
- Why are we watching this?

310
00:12:19,432 --> 00:12:21,155
Say hello to
our new guest commentator.

311
00:12:21,192 --> 00:12:23,047
I'm starting him off at
two segments a week,

312
00:12:23,048 --> 00:12:24,062
three minutes a pop.

313
00:12:24,105 --> 00:12:26,078
- Are you kidding me?
- Who the hell is this guy?

314
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,837
- Name's Mike Chadway.
- He's an uber-moron

315
00:12:28,841 --> 00:12:29,855
misogynist who represents

316
00:12:29,897 --> 00:12:31,870
everything that is wrong
with television and society.

317
00:12:31,913 --> 00:12:33,822
I get crap every time
I suggest we do something

318
00:12:33,865 --> 00:12:35,620
even remotely fluffy.

319
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,513
Oh, come on.
He's got a point of view.

320
00:12:37,576 --> 00:12:40,359
We don't have to like it.
I mean, we're newspeople.

321
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:41,320
We're objective.

322
00:12:41,352 --> 00:12:43,207
Stone Phillips interviews
terrorists.

323
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:45,250
Doesn't mean he likes them,
he does it for the ratings.

324
00:12:45,288 --> 00:12:47,176
I have a whole list of ideas
to improve ratings.

325
00:12:47,209 --> 00:12:49,096
You're gonna like it.
We don't need him.

326
00:12:49,129 --> 00:12:50,918
- We don't need him.
- Not at all.

327
00:12:50,952 --> 00:12:52,066
''An intimate profile
of the mayor''.

328
00:12:52,072 --> 00:12:53,022
- Yes.
- I like that.

329
00:12:53,066 --> 00:12:54,756
- I like the mayor.
- Fantastic.

330
00:12:54,793 --> 00:12:55,807
The mayor?

331
00:12:55,849 --> 00:12:57,672
Yes. It can be edgy
and yet intriguing.

332
00:12:57,673 --> 00:12:59,615
Unless you can get him to bang
three crack whores

333
00:12:59,658 --> 00:13:02,408
and a German shepherd
on live TV,

334
00:13:02,409 --> 00:13:03,587
no one's gonna give a shit.

335
00:13:05,354 --> 00:13:06,336
Oh, I'm sorry.

336
00:13:06,378 --> 00:13:08,134
I was eavesdropping
out in the hall.

337
00:13:09,354 --> 00:13:11,208
What did I tell you?
Isn't this guy great?

338
00:13:11,243 --> 00:13:13,065
Oh, thanks, boss.

339
00:13:13,097 --> 00:13:14,921
You already hired him?

340
00:13:14,953 --> 00:13:17,855
Who's this
delightful creature?

341
00:13:18,859 --> 00:13:20,581
I'm your producer.

342
00:13:20,619 --> 00:13:22,625
Oh. Hey.

343
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:25,383
I like a woman on top.

344
00:13:25,418 --> 00:13:26,346
Ugh. God.

345
00:13:28,363 --> 00:13:30,337
- Nice office.
- Ha-ha! He's just kidding.

346
00:13:30,346 --> 00:13:32,201
- Oh, yeah.
- Excuse me.

347
00:13:32,235 --> 00:13:34,090
- Hey, Mike, you see your office?
- No, I didn't.

348
00:13:34,091 --> 00:13:35,947
- Come on. Let me show you.
- Beautiful.

349
00:13:35,979 --> 00:13:37,834
Everybody take five.
I'll be right back.

350
00:13:37,868 --> 00:13:39,777
Were you all not there
last year...

351
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:40,866
for our
sexual-harassment meeting?

352
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:42,850
- Yes. Were you not there, Larry?
- He needs to go.

353
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:44,832
He wasn't
sexually harassing me.

354
00:13:46,604 --> 00:13:47,683
I am an award-winning
news producer.

355
00:13:47,724 --> 00:13:49,578
I am an award-winning
news producer.

356
00:13:49,611 --> 00:13:52,230
I am an award-winning
news producer.

357
00:13:52,268 --> 00:13:53,347
I am an awa...

358
00:13:53,388 --> 00:13:55,243
You're an award-winning
news producer.

359
00:13:55,244 --> 00:13:56,259
You don't knock?

360
00:13:56,299 --> 00:13:58,088
Well, I did knock.
You didn't answer.

361
00:13:58,124 --> 00:14:00,874
So essentially,
your knock was negated

362
00:14:00,876 --> 00:14:01,989
by your complete
lack of adherence

363
00:14:02,028 --> 00:14:04,964
to the social etiquette
that follows a knock.

364
00:14:05,965 --> 00:14:08,582
You're wound like a fucking top.

365
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:11,523
Woof, woof.
Remember the bark?

366
00:14:11,565 --> 00:14:13,572
Last night, a little
phone conversation we had.

367
00:14:13,581 --> 00:14:17,225
Yeah. Hey, what do you know?

368
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,373
You're not ugly at all.

369
00:14:18,413 --> 00:14:21,063
Oh, well,
imagine my relief.

370
00:14:21,134 --> 00:14:23,043
I want to thank you
for getting me this gig.

371
00:14:23,085 --> 00:14:25,059
I would never have gotten it
without you.

372
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,884
You and I, we make good TV.

373
00:14:27,917 --> 00:14:30,731
You make imbecilic trash
watched by housebound

374
00:14:30,734 --> 00:14:32,556
inbreds who are so busy
with their hands

375
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:35,459
down their pants,
they can't change the remote.

376
00:14:35,501 --> 00:14:38,403
I hadn't been picturing you
that way, but it's a nice image.

377
00:14:38,413 --> 00:14:39,461
I do not watch
your program·

378
00:14:39,501 --> 00:14:42,153
My cat stepped
on the remote.

379
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:45,124
Oh, you want to thank
your pussy for me, then?

380
00:14:45,165 --> 00:14:46,094
Ugh!

381
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:51,879
Larry, Georgia, listen to me.
I want you to skewer him.

382
00:14:51,886 --> 00:14:53,774
I want Mike Chadway
to go down in flames.

383
00:14:53,807 --> 00:14:55,716
I want Mike Chadway to be
nothing but a pile of ash

384
00:14:55,758 --> 00:14:56,773
on the seat next to you.

385
00:14:57,455 --> 00:14:59,429
I want the janitor to come in
and vacuum up the ashes

386
00:14:59,471 --> 00:15:00,583
of Mike Chadway
with his Dustbuster

387
00:15:00,623 --> 00:15:03,208
and when he dumps it
in the Dumpster outside,

388
00:15:03,215 --> 00:15:04,327
I want the rats to vomit
and defecate

389
00:15:04,366 --> 00:15:06,277
on the ashes of Mike Chadway.

390
00:15:06,318 --> 00:15:10,923
Wow. And I thought
you were angry and bitter.

391
00:15:10,927 --> 00:15:14,025
Uh, no, Larry, that would be
my untouched vagina.

392
00:15:14,735 --> 00:15:15,783
- Chadway?
- What?

393
00:15:15,792 --> 00:15:17,647
Twenty seconds to air.

394
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:19,534
About ready? Larry?

395
00:15:19,567 --> 00:15:20,679
There's a bird
in my dressing room.

396
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:21,701
I'll take care of it.

397
00:15:21,711 --> 00:15:24,298
- A real bird?
- Yeah. It's flying around.

398
00:15:24,336 --> 00:15:25,448
Why is there a bird
in his dressing room?

399
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,341
I don't know
what type of bird it is.

400
00:15:27,344 --> 00:15:28,270
Security here is awful.

401
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:30,245
You guys have really got
to keep the doors closed.

402
00:15:30,288 --> 00:15:32,011
Four, three...

403
00:15:33,104 --> 00:15:34,991
Good morning, everyone,
I'm Larry Freeman.

404
00:15:35,024 --> 00:15:36,846
Another beautiful day
in Sacramento.

405
00:15:36,847 --> 00:15:38,702
And I'm sitting here
with a beautiful woman.

406
00:15:38,736 --> 00:15:39,881
- Go, 1.
- All right, here we go.

407
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:42,538
Thank you, Larry.

408
00:15:42,576 --> 00:15:43,524
Hi. I'm Georgia Bordeney.

409
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:45,390
Ready for the single on Georgia.

410
00:15:45,423 --> 00:15:46,504
For years,
there have been concerns

411
00:15:46,544 --> 00:15:48,486
about lowering
television standards.

412
00:15:48,496 --> 00:15:50,253
But many believe that this man

413
00:15:50,288 --> 00:15:52,264
and his local
public-access show

414
00:15:52,304 --> 00:15:54,126
have brought things
to a new low.

415
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:56,976
With that,
we welcome Mike Chadway.

416
00:15:56,976 --> 00:15:58,951
How you doing, guys?

417
00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:00,039
Mike, how do you respond
to people

418
00:16:00,081 --> 00:16:01,804
who say your show is offensive?

419
00:16:01,841 --> 00:16:04,657
Well, it is.
But then again, so is the truth.

420
00:16:04,658 --> 00:16:07,724
Ha. The truth about what,
Mr. Chadway?

421
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,477
What relationships
are really like.

422
00:16:10,481 --> 00:16:12,270
Take marriage, for instance.

423
00:16:12,306 --> 00:16:15,174
It's about social pressure,

424
00:16:15,217 --> 00:16:18,066
status and sex.

425
00:16:18,066 --> 00:16:19,177
If it weren't for these
three things,

426
00:16:19,219 --> 00:16:21,006
men and women
wouldn't even speak.

427
00:16:21,043 --> 00:16:23,945
Oh, dear. Sounds to me
like no one's ever loved you,

428
00:16:23,985 --> 00:16:26,735
and you're taking that out
on the female population.

429
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:30,477
Good one.
It's like Crossfire.

430
00:16:30,514 --> 00:16:31,725
That was a good one.

431
00:16:32,403 --> 00:16:34,345
While we're making
these observations, Georgia,

432
00:16:34,385 --> 00:16:36,524
you two project this image
of the perfect couple,

433
00:16:37,202 --> 00:16:38,250
when clearly it's a lie.

434
00:16:39,283 --> 00:16:41,039
Excuse me?

435
00:16:41,075 --> 00:16:43,179
Holy shit.
Oh. Break for commercial.

436
00:16:43,187 --> 00:16:44,114
No, no, no.

437
00:16:44,147 --> 00:16:46,088
Stuart said keep rolling
no matter what.

438
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,985
What? When? This is my show.

439
00:16:47,986 --> 00:16:51,663
BOTH:
Not right now, it isn't.

440
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,609
Come on, Larry.
I watched your show for years.

441
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:56,586
You used to be this cool,
confident cat.

442
00:16:56,628 --> 00:16:58,415
What the hell
happened to you?

443
00:16:58,419 --> 00:17:02,195
And you, Georgia. I mean,
this one's no dumb bunny.

444
00:17:02,227 --> 00:17:04,299
She knew the only way she was
getting off the weekend shift

445
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:06,194
was by hooking up
with you.

446
00:17:06,228 --> 00:17:09,096
Then, lo and behold, she became
more popular than you did.

447
00:17:09,141 --> 00:17:10,864
Ended up with twice
your salary.

448
00:17:10,901 --> 00:17:12,689
Come on, Larry, take him down.

449
00:17:12,724 --> 00:17:13,771
Shh!

450
00:17:13,811 --> 00:17:16,747
Hold on, pal. I am very proud
of my wife's success.

451
00:17:16,757 --> 00:17:19,571
Mm, baloney, you are.
You hate her success.

452
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:21,394
You feel emasculated by her.

453
00:17:21,428 --> 00:17:23,371
And that screws with your head.

454
00:17:24,404 --> 00:17:27,056
Which, in turn,
screws with your manhood.

455
00:17:27,093 --> 00:17:29,198
What's your point, Mr. Chadway?

456
00:17:29,237 --> 00:17:32,106
- Yes, Georgia, take control.
- My point, Georgia...

457
00:17:32,148 --> 00:17:34,931
My point is
that your husband

458
00:17:34,932 --> 00:17:37,616
hasn't had
sex with you in...

459
00:17:37,653 --> 00:17:39,758
I'm gonna say,
what, three months?

460
00:17:39,798 --> 00:17:42,515
- Chadway, that is not my fault.
- I know.

461
00:17:42,518 --> 00:17:45,451
- I mean, come on.
- I know, I know. It's her fault.

462
00:17:45,493 --> 00:17:48,363
Why is it my fault?
What am I supposed to do?

463
00:17:48,405 --> 00:17:50,229
Say no to the money
so he can get an erection?

464
00:17:50,261 --> 00:17:52,018
She said ''erection''
on network TV.

465
00:17:52,054 --> 00:17:53,165
The other networks do it.
No big deal.

466
00:17:53,173 --> 00:17:55,028
- They're talking about erections.
- Be quiet!

467
00:17:55,061 --> 00:17:56,916
They say ''erection''
on Sesame Street.

468
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,029
- I agree.
- Thank you.

469
00:17:58,038 --> 00:18:00,788
You've economically
emasculated your husband

470
00:18:00,823 --> 00:18:03,757
to such a point
that he's afraid to want you.

471
00:18:03,767 --> 00:18:05,556
- Ugh.
- I mean, sure,

472
00:18:05,589 --> 00:18:07,378
you could dump his ass, but,
honey,

473
00:18:07,413 --> 00:18:11,375
have you seen the eligible men
in Sacramento? Oh, God.

474
00:18:11,414 --> 00:18:14,163
It's slim pickings for a woman
in her 40s, I can tell you.

475
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:15,279
Forties?

476
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,006
Oh, God.

477
00:18:17,047 --> 00:18:18,934
Hold that shot
with Georgia and Mike.

478
00:18:18,967 --> 00:18:20,047
He just talked about her age.

479
00:18:20,087 --> 00:18:21,910
- She's gonna kill me.
- Well.

480
00:18:21,943 --> 00:18:23,700
Forty?

481
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:25,742
I mean, you ain't gonna do
any better than Larry.

482
00:18:25,784 --> 00:18:28,718
- You just have to let him be a man.
- Hm?

483
00:18:28,728 --> 00:18:30,583
- Let him be a man, Georgia.
- I let him be a man.

484
00:18:30,615 --> 00:18:31,564
You have to let me be a man.

485
00:18:31,607 --> 00:18:33,332
I have tried to let you
be a man.

486
00:18:33,367 --> 00:18:35,309
- Let him be a man.
- You have to let me be a man.

487
00:18:35,384 --> 00:18:38,253
Simple as that. Now, you,
Frowny McFlaccid, come on.

488
00:18:38,263 --> 00:18:39,192
Oh, God.

489
00:18:39,223 --> 00:18:41,165
Ready for a three-shot.
Zoom In.

490
00:18:41,209 --> 00:18:43,030
- I'm not frowny.
- Yes, you are.

491
00:18:43,064 --> 00:18:45,007
Move in here and give
this beautiful woman a kiss.

492
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:45,970
Oh, God.

493
00:18:46,009 --> 00:18:47,765
This is ridiculous.
McFlaccid?

494
00:18:47,769 --> 00:18:49,808
- That mean what I think it means?
- Yes, it does. Kiss her.

495
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:51,599
No, no, no.
They're not gonna...

496
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,654
Give it to her,
right in front of me.

497
00:18:52,729 --> 00:18:54,584
- And in front of them.
- Let me...

498
00:18:54,585 --> 00:18:57,432
Goddamn it, Georgia,
let me be a man!

499
00:18:57,464 --> 00:19:01,042
- No!
- Oh! Zoom in on that, 2. Zoom in.

500
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,192
America doesn't wanna see this!

501
00:19:02,232 --> 00:19:05,942
And that, my friends,
is the ugly truth.

502
00:19:05,977 --> 00:19:07,951
Get ready to roll to break.
Ready to roll...

503
00:19:07,992 --> 00:19:10,862
Oh, you are a man.
He is a man. Break.

504
00:19:10,905 --> 00:19:12,693
Cut to commercial!

505
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:14,486
Cut to commercial!

506
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,699
That was great!
Wasn't that great?

507
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:17,592
I told you
that guy was great.

508
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:20,277
Good job,
everybody. Wow!

509
00:19:21,306 --> 00:19:23,192
Abby?

510
00:19:25,145 --> 00:19:27,000
Found her.

511
00:19:27,001 --> 00:19:29,074
1,143 calls,

512
00:19:29,114 --> 00:19:32,692
over 300 e-mails, 53 percent
of them were women.

513
00:19:32,761 --> 00:19:35,609
This guy's
a lightning rod.

514
00:19:35,642 --> 00:19:36,721
They liked him?

515
00:19:36,761 --> 00:19:38,616
Liked him?
They loved him.

516
00:19:38,617 --> 00:19:40,440
93 percent positive.

517
00:19:40,474 --> 00:19:42,416
- How is that possible?
- I don't know.

518
00:19:42,426 --> 00:19:44,314
But I am
scaling back the news

519
00:19:44,346 --> 00:19:45,426
and giving it
to The Ugly Truth.

520
00:19:46,171 --> 00:19:48,079
Stuart, I really think
this is a mistake.

521
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:49,979
What do we even
know about this guy?

522
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:51,189
Who is he, really?

523
00:19:51,194 --> 00:19:52,819
Moved here when he was 10,

524
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:54,900
pitched two consecutive
Little League Championships.

525
00:19:54,939 --> 00:19:55,921
Cute.

526
00:19:55,932 --> 00:19:57,654
voted ''Most Likely
to Get Slapped''

527
00:19:57,691 --> 00:19:59,730
in his senior yearbook.
Three years at San José State.

528
00:19:59,771 --> 00:20:02,489
Salesman of the Year at
Dobson Medical Supplies in '04.

529
00:20:02,522 --> 00:20:04,411
Once arrested for urinating
out of a moving vehicle.

530
00:20:04,442 --> 00:20:06,298
That is actually
incredibly challenging.

531
00:20:06,332 --> 00:20:07,259
Tell me about it.

532
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:09,179
Never been married,
hates asparagus.

533
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:11,154
Look, let's just keep a smile
on this guy's face,

534
00:20:11,195 --> 00:20:14,097
and we'll both get
our contracts renewed.

535
00:20:15,996 --> 00:20:18,003
Congratulations?

536
00:20:32,348 --> 00:20:34,258
Mike. Hi, it's Lauren.

537
00:20:34,269 --> 00:20:36,243
I'm having a party on Saturday
and you know what happens

538
00:20:36,285 --> 00:20:39,035
when I drink tequila.
Ha-ha-ha.

539
00:20:42,012 --> 00:20:47,709
It's me, Nikki.
Why haven't you called me? I miss you.

540
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,563
- I can't stop...
- Hey.

541
00:20:49,597 --> 00:20:50,677
thinking about your huge...

542
00:20:52,348 --> 00:20:54,388
Who's that?
Rubbing all over my...

543
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:58,076
- Dripping wet...
- How was...?

544
00:20:59,134 --> 00:21:01,020
How was school?

545
00:21:02,046 --> 00:21:04,861
- Well, you totally hosed me.
- What?

546
00:21:04,894 --> 00:21:06,682
Last week on your show,
you said,

547
00:21:06,718 --> 00:21:07,798
''Always be mean to hot girls

548
00:21:07,838 --> 00:21:10,806
because they'll want you more''.
Well, I tried it on Shauna.

549
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:13,526
She cried,
and then I got detention.

550
00:21:13,566 --> 00:21:16,500
First of all, don't listen
to what I say on my show.

551
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:20,307
Second of all, you're supposed
to do that to 25-year-old girls

552
00:21:20,382 --> 00:21:23,196
who think they're hot and
can get any guy they want,

553
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:25,883
not 14-year-old girls.

554
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:27,031
They're going through puberty.

555
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:29,722
They got enough problems.

556
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:30,872
Mom said when she was 14,

557
00:21:30,911 --> 00:21:33,693
she was the prettiest girl
in class.

558
00:21:33,694 --> 00:21:34,742
Well, I was there when
she was 14,

559
00:21:34,782 --> 00:21:36,637
and let me tell you something.
She lied.

560
00:21:36,671 --> 00:21:38,493
Don't listen to your Uncle Mike.

561
00:21:38,527 --> 00:21:42,203
He was blind from touching
himself inappropriately.

562
00:21:42,207 --> 00:21:44,279
Ha. That's a nice thing
to tell your son.

563
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:47,134
Like he hasn't heard worse
on your show.

564
00:21:47,135 --> 00:21:50,038
Let's hope you can clean it up
now that you're on a network.

565
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:52,730
Congrats.

566
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:10,013
Oh!
D'Artagnan, no, you didn't!

567
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,185
No, D'Artagnan, you get
back here. Get back here.

568
00:22:12,192 --> 00:22:14,844
No, do not... No, no, no.

569
00:22:16,992 --> 00:22:19,840
D'Artagnan.

570
00:22:19,873 --> 00:22:22,459
D'Artagnan!

571
00:22:22,497 --> 00:22:23,642
Shit!

572
00:22:25,506 --> 00:22:26,553
All right.

573
00:22:26,594 --> 00:22:29,211
I'll just come up.

574
00:22:30,306 --> 00:22:34,016
I'm really not that flexible,
D'Artagnan. I'm coming.

575
00:22:34,048 --> 00:22:35,936
I got you, hold on.

576
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:37,943
Hold on. Come here, baby.

577
00:22:37,953 --> 00:22:40,703
No, no. No, no. Come on.
Come here, D'Artagnan.

578
00:22:40,769 --> 00:22:43,672
Good boy.
Oh, good boy. Okay.

579
00:22:43,713 --> 00:22:46,431
Okay. You're gonna be okay.

580
00:22:46,467 --> 00:22:48,375
Oh. I hope we can get down.

581
00:22:55,329 --> 00:22:57,020
Oh, my.

582
00:23:01,891 --> 00:23:02,817
Oh, my.

583
00:23:03,907 --> 00:23:04,800
My, my.

584
00:23:07,778 --> 00:23:08,707
Ooh.

585
00:23:10,434 --> 00:23:12,539
He flosses.

586
00:23:18,211 --> 00:23:20,219
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.

587
00:23:20,259 --> 00:23:22,977
Somebody help me!
Somebody help me!

588
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,835
I'm stuck in a tree!

589
00:23:24,867 --> 00:23:27,007
Help me! Anybody!

590
00:23:27,683 --> 00:23:29,691
- I'm stuck in a tree! I'm stuck!
- Stay, stay calm.

591
00:23:29,731 --> 00:23:32,601
- You're gonna be fine.
- Get me down! Get me down!

592
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:36,548
Sorry. Oh, my God.

593
00:23:36,612 --> 00:23:39,230
So you just moved in.
That's great.

594
00:23:39,269 --> 00:23:40,381
I'm Abby, by the way.

595
00:23:40,421 --> 00:23:43,072
Your neighbor
from across the way.

596
00:23:43,076 --> 00:23:45,148
So you're a doctor? Wow.

597
00:23:45,156 --> 00:23:46,880
An orthopedic surgeon.

598
00:23:46,949 --> 00:23:48,061
Yeah, I do a lotta
leg and hip stuff,

599
00:23:48,101 --> 00:23:50,686
but I do get
the occasional foot.

600
00:23:50,757 --> 00:23:51,902
Your ankle seems to be fine.

601
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:53,698
Just a mild sprain,
so this should help.

602
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:54,779
Great. Thank you.

603
00:23:55,493 --> 00:23:57,435
I guess I'm pretty lucky
my cat chose the tree

604
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:58,491
outside your window to climb.

605
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:02,178
Well, I'm here
whenever you need me.

606
00:24:02,246 --> 00:24:03,357
Look, I'm gonna put
my home number

607
00:24:03,365 --> 00:24:05,088
on the back
of my business card.

608
00:24:05,125 --> 00:24:07,035
If your ankle starts giving you
any problems,

609
00:24:07,076 --> 00:24:08,156
just give me a call.

610
00:24:08,198 --> 00:24:11,067
Great. Thanks.

611
00:24:12,837 --> 00:24:15,740
Oh, wow, that's so weird.
He doesn't usually like men.

612
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:18,532
Well, you know,
dogs are great, but, uh...

613
00:24:18,566 --> 00:24:20,453
I'm a cat person.

614
00:24:22,375 --> 00:24:23,388
Yeah.

615
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:29,310
Well, I guess
I'll get going, then.

616
00:24:29,317 --> 00:24:31,173
Yeah.

617
00:24:31,173 --> 00:24:32,897
Yeah.

618
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:36,827
Yeah. Ha-ha.

619
00:24:38,951 --> 00:24:41,634
- Thanks again for saving my life.
- Anytime.

620
00:24:41,638 --> 00:24:44,486
- Okay. Bye.
- Okay. Bye.

621
00:24:48,326 --> 00:24:50,269
- You forgot your cat.
- Right.

622
00:24:50,311 --> 00:24:51,358
I had a spider on me. Ugh.

623
00:24:51,398 --> 00:24:53,253
- Yeah.
- It's gone now, though. Good.

624
00:24:53,288 --> 00:24:54,979
- All right, okay.
- Bye.

625
00:24:55,016 --> 00:24:57,022
- Thanks again.
- Good night.

626
00:24:58,887 --> 00:25:01,734
You are not gonna believe
how perfect he is.

627
00:25:01,768 --> 00:25:02,881
- Symmetrical?
- Oh, you have no idea.

628
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,611
- Oh, good Lord.
- Yeah.

629
00:25:04,647 --> 00:25:05,596
Well, how did you leave it?

630
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,686
I mean, did he ask
for your number?

631
00:25:06,728 --> 00:25:07,676
No, but he gave me his.

632
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,509
So what do I do?
Should I call him?

633
00:25:09,512 --> 00:25:11,300
If I call do call him,
what should I say?

634
00:25:11,336 --> 00:25:12,384
- Okay. Take a breath.
- Uh-huh.

635
00:25:12,423 --> 00:25:14,147
And please, sweetheart,

636
00:25:14,183 --> 00:25:15,231
- No tap water.
- No tap water.

637
00:25:15,272 --> 00:25:17,095
Don't bring it up.

638
00:25:17,128 --> 00:25:18,143
You've got naughty eyes.

639
00:25:18,184 --> 00:25:20,902
- Anyone ever tell you that?
- I have naughty everything.

640
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:21,885
Hold that thought.

641
00:25:21,929 --> 00:25:23,969
No, hey,
you won't get in trouble.

642
00:25:24,009 --> 00:25:25,896
Down a bit. Down a bit.

643
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:28,734
Okay.

644
00:25:29,673 --> 00:25:31,461
Bye, Karen.

645
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:35,521
Keep it clean, moving,
stick to the script.

646
00:25:35,529 --> 00:25:37,384
You are on a live
affiliate news program.

647
00:25:37,416 --> 00:25:39,271
You do not have the luxury
of using the words

648
00:25:39,273 --> 00:25:41,096
''blow'' and ''job''
in the same sentence.

649
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:42,984
If you say anything
scatological,

650
00:25:43,018 --> 00:25:44,131
you will be fired.

651
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:45,855
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

652
00:25:45,865 --> 00:25:47,839
Because I kind of thought
that you were the one

653
00:25:47,913 --> 00:25:50,663
that was gonna get fired
if you don't keep me happy.

654
00:25:50,698 --> 00:25:54,494
Yes. I've got a list of demands
that I would like to make

655
00:25:54,506 --> 00:25:56,480
after the show,
and let me just warn you,

656
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:59,304
they're gonna be
scatological.

657
00:26:01,355 --> 00:26:03,210
Ow. Ah.

658
00:26:03,241 --> 00:26:05,991
You know, just because
you look pretty today,

659
00:26:06,026 --> 00:26:08,961
I won't mention the misguided
phallic rage you just displayed.

660
00:26:08,971 --> 00:26:10,792
When you hear my voice,
just do what I say.

661
00:26:10,795 --> 00:26:12,650
Heh-heh.
Promise you'll talk dirty?

662
00:26:13,866 --> 00:26:16,518
Good morning,
Sacramento. I'm Larry Freeman.

663
00:26:16,555 --> 00:26:17,634
And I'm Georgia Bordeney.

664
00:26:17,643 --> 00:26:19,334
And I'm Mike Chadway.

665
00:26:19,371 --> 00:26:21,259
And this is The Ugly Truth.

666
00:26:21,323 --> 00:26:23,394
Where we'll be taking
a few minutes every day

667
00:26:23,403 --> 00:26:28,039
to talk about men, women
and relationships.

668
00:26:28,076 --> 00:26:29,931
Let's start with men.

669
00:26:29,962 --> 00:26:31,076
Men are simple.

670
00:26:31,115 --> 00:26:32,904
To illustrate my point,

671
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:35,656
here we have
a classic romantic setting.

672
00:26:35,692 --> 00:26:39,684
We have, uh, candlelight,
champagne, and even

673
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:41,665
your own personal violinist.

674
00:26:41,708 --> 00:26:42,635
Now,

675
00:26:43,564 --> 00:26:46,314
over here, we have something
quite different.

676
00:26:46,347 --> 00:26:49,130
This isn't on my list.
Ha-ha-ha! Follow me.

677
00:26:49,163 --> 00:26:51,050
Is the segment over?

678
00:26:51,051 --> 00:26:52,961
Where the hell's he going?

679
00:26:53,003 --> 00:26:54,979
- Follow him. Follow him.
- Go with him, Remote.

680
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,777
Go with him, Remote 1.

681
00:26:56,813 --> 00:27:00,707
Hey.
Babes wrestling in Jell-O.

682
00:27:00,717 --> 00:27:03,586
- Oh, Jell-O. That's great.
- Hello? Abby?

683
00:27:03,628 --> 00:27:05,483
There's people calling

684
00:27:05,517 --> 00:27:07,339
- and freaking out.
- Oh, Jesus.

685
00:27:07,373 --> 00:27:09,315
- Sit down!
- Turn the monitor up.

686
00:27:09,325 --> 00:27:10,404
Let's take a quick survey

687
00:27:10,444 --> 00:27:13,063
and see which option
the men out there would pick.

688
00:27:13,133 --> 00:27:15,141
We have classical music
and candle-lit dinner,

689
00:27:15,182 --> 00:27:20,778
or semi-naked chicks wrestling
in strawberry-flavored goo.

690
00:27:20,814 --> 00:27:21,827
Aah!

691
00:27:23,758 --> 00:27:25,547
Oh, shit.

692
00:27:25,582 --> 00:27:27,470
All right.

693
00:27:27,501 --> 00:27:30,403
If we're gonna do this,
we might as well milk it.

694
00:27:30,445 --> 00:27:33,292
Two, get ready to go wide.
One, tight on his hand.

695
00:27:33,326 --> 00:27:36,076
Lick the Jell-O off her finger.

696
00:27:36,365 --> 00:27:38,983
Lick the Jell-O off her finger.

697
00:27:39,022 --> 00:27:41,029
Just do it.

698
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:52,650
I was wrong. It's cherry.

699
00:27:52,654 --> 00:27:56,201
Back to you in the studio,
Georgia. Bye.

700
00:27:56,239 --> 00:27:57,416
Uh...

701
00:27:57,454 --> 00:27:59,343
Coming up,
we're gonna visit the aquarium

702
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:01,230
and see how
Penny the Porpoise is doing.

703
00:28:01,263 --> 00:28:03,086
Can she
clear that 10-foot pole

704
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:05,989
with a ball on her nose?
When we come back.

705
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,821
When we come back.

706
00:28:12,624 --> 00:28:16,398
Chemistry.
I smell threesome.

707
00:28:16,432 --> 00:28:17,413
Ah.

708
00:28:18,352 --> 00:28:21,221
Great job, ladies.
I can still taste you.

709
00:28:21,265 --> 00:28:22,278
You know what I mean.

710
00:28:25,231 --> 00:28:27,086
Huh?
Do you realize that

711
00:28:27,121 --> 00:28:29,869
I once had the Archbishop
Desmond Tutu on this show?

712
00:28:29,872 --> 00:28:30,886
Who's that?

713
00:28:30,928 --> 00:28:32,837
I can't even demonstrate
how far I've fallen

714
00:28:32,881 --> 00:28:35,564
because you're not smart enough
to get the references.

715
00:28:35,601 --> 00:28:37,673
Hey, wait, wait, wait. I thought
we were a great team back there.

716
00:28:37,712 --> 00:28:39,599
You were the one that
told me to lick the Jell-O.

717
00:28:39,633 --> 00:28:42,284
Do you understand
how much I hate myself for that?

718
00:28:42,288 --> 00:28:43,304
It was cheap titillation.

719
00:28:43,376 --> 00:28:45,231
I am now going
to broadcasting hell

720
00:28:45,266 --> 00:28:48,200
right behind the naked
weather girl from Canada.

721
00:28:49,136 --> 00:28:50,925
Seriously?

722
00:28:50,992 --> 00:28:52,968
There's a
naked weather girl?

723
00:28:53,009 --> 00:28:54,765
Hey, can we get her?

724
00:28:54,769 --> 00:28:56,875
You have to do it
for the ratings, Abby.

725
00:28:56,913 --> 00:28:58,768
Think of my son.

726
00:28:58,801 --> 00:29:01,519
My son, who had a dream
of being a cosmetician.

727
00:29:01,554 --> 00:29:03,625
Think about him.
Think about Joy.

728
00:29:04,337 --> 00:29:05,450
Just do it for me.

729
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:07,463
Today it'll be partly sunny
with a cloud cover moving in

730
00:29:08,178 --> 00:29:10,086
from my left breast.

731
00:29:10,131 --> 00:29:12,137
Low pressure systems
are moving up,

732
00:29:12,178 --> 00:29:13,192
so expect a cold front.

733
00:29:17,939 --> 00:29:20,873
Watch Mike Chadway
on Sacramento A.M.,

734
00:29:20,914 --> 00:29:23,729
giving us The Ugly Truth
each and every day

735
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:25,519
at 9:00, right here
on Channel 2.

736
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:27,409
Oh, God.

737
00:29:31,442 --> 00:29:33,298
I used
to really like caviar,

738
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:35,185
until I found out it was
made out of fish eggs.

739
00:29:35,219 --> 00:29:37,074
- Did you know that?
- Caviar's revolting.

740
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:39,049
- I almost started to gag.
- Morning, ladies.

741
00:29:39,058 --> 00:29:41,001
- John.
- Yesterday's ratings.

742
00:29:41,044 --> 00:29:43,628
Oh. Thanks, John.

743
00:29:45,844 --> 00:29:48,461
Guess I should be happy
about this, right?

744
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:51,500
Uh, yeah. Yeah. You've never
gotten a 12-share before.

745
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:54,257
I feel dirty.

746
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:55,404
Did you hear about
the ratings?

747
00:29:56,116 --> 00:29:57,326
Yes,
I am the producer.

748
00:29:58,037 --> 00:30:00,076
Well, then did you hear that
corporate's coming next week

749
00:30:00,115 --> 00:30:01,195
to take me out to dinner?

750
00:30:01,876 --> 00:30:03,916
Oh. Well, let's hope you can
chew with your mouth closed.

751
00:30:05,717 --> 00:30:06,731
Why do you hate my guts?

752
00:30:06,772 --> 00:30:08,748
Your innards are of
no consequence to me.

753
00:30:08,788 --> 00:30:09,770
It's what you represent.

754
00:30:09,811 --> 00:30:11,601
- Oh, you hate the truth.
- Ha.

755
00:30:11,605 --> 00:30:13,579
Your skewed perception
of male-female interaction

756
00:30:13,621 --> 00:30:15,376
is not the truth.

757
00:30:15,413 --> 00:30:18,228
But your imaginary
boyfriend's the truth?

758
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:21,195
For your information,
I happened to meet him.

759
00:30:21,237 --> 00:30:23,026
Mm. Well, I hope
he's real this time,

760
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:24,173
because otherwise
this is just sad.

761
00:30:24,212 --> 00:30:26,864
Oh, he's real.
He's very real.

762
00:30:26,901 --> 00:30:29,868
Not to mention stunningly
handsome, morally sound.

763
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:32,660
He's a surgeon.
An orthopedic surgeon.

764
00:30:32,693 --> 00:30:34,548
- You know what that means.
- What?

765
00:30:34,549 --> 00:30:36,622
Had to stick his finger up
some guy's butt

766
00:30:37,365 --> 00:30:38,314
in medical school.

767
00:30:38,357 --> 00:30:39,536
You disgust me.

768
00:30:42,357 --> 00:30:45,173
So did Butt Boy ask you out?

769
00:30:45,205 --> 00:30:47,094
Not yet.

770
00:30:47,125 --> 00:30:48,914
We're taking things slow,

771
00:30:48,951 --> 00:30:50,063
getting to know
each other first.

772
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:51,826
Why am I
talking to you about this?

773
00:30:51,862 --> 00:30:54,797
In other words,
he didn't actually ask you out.

774
00:31:00,598 --> 00:31:02,486
What are you doing?

775
00:31:06,166 --> 00:31:08,054
Doctor's office.

776
00:31:08,086 --> 00:31:10,094
Hi. This is Abby Richter
calling for Dr. Anderson.

777
00:31:10,103 --> 00:31:11,117
Please hold.
Yes, I'll hold.

778
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:12,107
- What're you doing?
- Shh!

779
00:31:12,152 --> 00:31:13,940
- Why are you calling this guy?
- Shh.

780
00:31:13,976 --> 00:31:14,958
- Shh.
- No.

781
00:31:14,967 --> 00:31:17,750
- Dr. Anderson.
- Hi, Colin. This is Abby.

782
00:31:17,782 --> 00:31:20,532
Your neighbor
from last night.

783
00:31:21,592 --> 00:31:23,632
Hey. Everything okay?

784
00:31:23,672 --> 00:31:26,388
How's the, uh,
ankle treating you?

785
00:31:26,423 --> 00:31:28,333
Couldn't be better.

786
00:31:28,375 --> 00:31:30,286
I was just calling
to let you know

787
00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:33,174
how much I enjoyed
meeting you last night.

788
00:31:34,167 --> 00:31:36,022
Thanks.

789
00:31:37,113 --> 00:31:38,836
Uh,
and I was thinking we should

790
00:31:38,873 --> 00:31:39,855
go out for dinner sometime.

791
00:31:39,864 --> 00:31:40,846
Oh.

792
00:31:40,888 --> 00:31:43,671
There is a new
French bistro in town

793
00:31:43,673 --> 00:31:45,559
and an art opening
that got amazing reviews.

794
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:50,226
So I was thinking
we could go on Friday.

795
00:31:50,297 --> 00:31:53,265
Um, Friday.
Oh. Wow.

796
00:31:53,272 --> 00:31:56,121
Would Saturday be better?
Actually,

797
00:31:56,122 --> 00:32:00,083
Abby, the thing is,
I haven't really settled in yet.

798
00:32:01,978 --> 00:32:02,925
What the hell
are you doing?

799
00:32:02,969 --> 00:32:04,791
I'm saving you.
He was blowing you off.

800
00:32:04,825 --> 00:32:06,580
He wasn't blowing me off!

801
00:32:06,617 --> 00:32:08,722
Don't. Okay, he'll be
expecting you to call him.

802
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,346
And when you don't,
he'll call back.

803
00:32:11,384 --> 00:32:13,523
How do you know?
Because I know how men operate.

804
00:32:13,529 --> 00:32:16,181
If you want it to
work out with this guy,

805
00:32:16,218 --> 00:32:18,192
then you'll listen to me,
and you'll do exactly as I say.

806
00:32:18,233 --> 00:32:20,175
You've probably already done
irreparable damage

807
00:32:20,219 --> 00:32:23,032
with your psycho-aggressive
control-freak phone call.

808
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:24,789
It might even be too late.

809
00:32:24,794 --> 00:32:25,874
And if you do salvage
the situation,

810
00:32:25,945 --> 00:32:27,834
you'll never be more than Abby,

811
00:32:27,835 --> 00:32:29,623
his desperate neighbor.

812
00:32:29,659 --> 00:32:31,634
I'm not desperate.

813
00:32:31,643 --> 00:32:33,650
Why? Did you think
I sounded desperate?

814
00:32:33,691 --> 00:32:35,512
Listen to you.

815
00:32:35,547 --> 00:32:38,263
Desperately asking me
if you sound desperate.

816
00:32:40,282 --> 00:32:42,171
- Ah! Oh!
- Okay.

817
00:32:42,203 --> 00:32:44,113
Although you won't admit it,

818
00:32:44,186 --> 00:32:46,936
you know that I know
what I'm talking about.

819
00:32:46,971 --> 00:32:49,818
It's your call, dude.

820
00:32:49,851 --> 00:32:51,705
Fine. What do I do?

821
00:32:51,707 --> 00:32:52,819
Pick up and say, ''Hey, Doug''.

822
00:32:52,859 --> 00:32:55,609
- Why would I...?
- Just do it.

823
00:32:55,644 --> 00:32:57,432
Hey, Doug.

824
00:32:57,467 --> 00:32:59,573
Uh, no.
This is Colin.

825
00:33:00,251 --> 00:33:02,259
Oh, my God!
I'm so sorry.

826
00:33:02,299 --> 00:33:03,346
That's perfect.

827
00:33:03,387 --> 00:33:06,105
Uh, who's,
uh, Doug?

828
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:07,929
Who's Doug?

829
00:33:07,963 --> 00:33:10,037
He's just a guy I'm seeing.
It's nothing serious.

830
00:33:10,045 --> 00:33:12,946
Just a guy I'm seeing.
It's nothing serious.

831
00:33:12,988 --> 00:33:14,614
Oh, okay.

832
00:33:16,635 --> 00:33:18,459
- Hang on a second.
- Hang on a second.

833
00:33:18,491 --> 00:33:19,507
Sure.

834
00:33:20,605 --> 00:33:22,296
Now what?

835
00:33:22,332 --> 00:33:23,280
Now just make him wait.

836
00:33:23,325 --> 00:33:25,212
If he's still holding
after 30 more seconds,

837
00:33:25,244 --> 00:33:26,292
you may
actually have a chance.

838
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,089
No one's gonna wait
for somebody

839
00:33:28,125 --> 00:33:29,106
they're trying to blow off.

840
00:33:29,148 --> 00:33:30,971
You better
be right about this.

841
00:33:31,005 --> 00:33:31,953
Just give me a little time,

842
00:33:31,964 --> 00:33:33,077
I'm gonna make this guy
your bitch.

843
00:33:33,116 --> 00:33:35,058
I don't want a bitch.
Colin would never be a bitch.

844
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:37,651
He is a well-rounded man

845
00:33:37,692 --> 00:33:40,759
capable of mature emotions
and deep, abiding love.

846
00:33:40,828 --> 00:33:43,448
Things which
you know not of.

847
00:33:43,452 --> 00:33:45,427
Maybe not.
But I do know about lust,

848
00:33:45,469 --> 00:33:46,483
seduction and manipulation.

849
00:33:46,526 --> 00:33:48,381
Things that you know not of.

850
00:33:49,438 --> 00:33:51,227
Abby, I'll make you a deal.

851
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:54,011
If you do exactly as I say,
and you get this guy,

852
00:33:54,046 --> 00:33:56,980
then you'll quit giving me shit
and you'll work with me.

853
00:33:57,021 --> 00:33:59,892
You know as well as I do that
we could make this show huge.

854
00:33:59,933 --> 00:34:02,836
And if it doesn't work?
What do I get?

855
00:34:04,702 --> 00:34:06,459
Then I'll quit.

856
00:34:06,493 --> 00:34:08,534
You're really
that confident?

857
00:34:14,206 --> 00:34:16,246
It's been more than 30 seconds.

858
00:34:21,887 --> 00:34:24,702
All right, deal. Now what?

859
00:34:24,702 --> 00:34:26,590
Always make an impression.

860
00:34:26,623 --> 00:34:28,510
Let's get a move on.
We have work to do.

861
00:34:28,543 --> 00:34:30,518
But what about the...?

862
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:32,469
In five seconds,
he'll call. Come on.

863
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:34,300
What are you,
Nostradamus?

864
00:34:35,391 --> 00:34:37,278
Amazing.

865
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:41,237
Rule number one:
never criticize.

866
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,992
Even if it's constructive?
Never.

867
00:34:44,032 --> 00:34:46,780
Men are incapable of growth,
change or progress.

868
00:34:46,815 --> 00:34:48,889
For men, self-improvement
ends at toilet training.

869
00:34:48,929 --> 00:34:51,514
- Huh.
- Mm.

870
00:34:51,552 --> 00:34:53,692
And rule number two:
laugh at whatever he says.

871
00:34:53,728 --> 00:34:56,315
What if what he says
isn't funny?

872
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,302
That's irrelevant.

873
00:34:57,344 --> 00:34:59,231
A fake laugh is like
a fake orgasm.

874
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:00,213
A fake orgasm is good?

875
00:35:00,289 --> 00:35:03,039
No, but a fake orgasm
is better than no orgasm at all.

876
00:35:03,072 --> 00:35:05,146
A fake orgasm is no orgasm.
Only to you.

877
00:35:05,152 --> 00:35:07,902
You're not the only person
in the room, you know.

878
00:35:07,936 --> 00:35:09,846
Let's not be selfish.

879
00:35:09,889 --> 00:35:11,677
Now, that was perfect.

880
00:35:11,713 --> 00:35:13,623
Real or fake?

881
00:35:13,664 --> 00:35:14,744
You'll never know.

882
00:35:14,786 --> 00:35:18,364
¶ My face to the sky
Dreaming about just how high

883
00:35:18,434 --> 00:35:21,282
Rule number three:
men are very visual.

884
00:35:21,313 --> 00:35:23,202
We have to change your look.

885
00:35:23,233 --> 00:35:24,347
What's wrong with my look?

886
00:35:24,385 --> 00:35:27,201
Abby, you're a very
attractive woman,

887
00:35:27,233 --> 00:35:29,021
but you are completely
inaccessible.

888
00:35:29,057 --> 00:35:30,880
You're all about
comfort and efficiency.

889
00:35:30,914 --> 00:35:32,802
What's wrong with comfort
and efficiency?

890
00:35:32,835 --> 00:35:34,875
Well, nothing,
except no one wants to fuck it.

891
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:38,682
Hello. May I be of assistance?
Yes, you may.

892
00:35:38,722 --> 00:35:40,545
We need cocktail dresses,

893
00:35:40,577 --> 00:35:43,425
tight jeans and some bras
that'll make my friend's breasts

894
00:35:43,427 --> 00:35:46,295
sit up and say hello.

895
00:35:46,306 --> 00:35:48,248
They're not saying hello now?
What are they saying?

896
00:35:48,291 --> 00:35:51,007
Actually, they're giving off
more of a passing nod

897
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:52,898
rather than
an outright greeting.

898
00:35:52,963 --> 00:35:55,068
You know what?
Why don't you try this on?

899
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:56,925
I think this would be wonderful.
Ha-ha!

900
00:35:56,963 --> 00:35:58,873
Now, that is a bra.

901
00:35:58,882 --> 00:36:00,771
Mm-hm.
Boobies in this thing say,

902
00:36:00,802 --> 00:36:03,552
''Put me in your mouth,
I taste good''.

903
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:07,295
I'm actually wearing one
right now as we speak.

904
00:36:08,387 --> 00:36:10,297
Length is very important.

905
00:36:10,338 --> 00:36:12,313
We need short enough
to see some thigh,

906
00:36:12,355 --> 00:36:15,137
but not so short to see vag.

907
00:36:15,172 --> 00:36:17,889
Mm. vag says
you're trying too hard.

908
00:36:17,891 --> 00:36:18,907
You think?

909
00:36:18,947 --> 00:36:21,697
Jeans are all about
the curvature of the ass.

910
00:36:21,731 --> 00:36:23,641
You've... Well,
you've got the raw materials.

911
00:36:23,652 --> 00:36:25,626
Now all you need is
the proper presentation.

912
00:36:25,668 --> 00:36:27,456
Did you just tell me
I have a nice ass?

913
00:36:27,492 --> 00:36:28,539
Do you always have
to be so crass?

914
00:36:28,579 --> 00:36:29,561
Oh!

915
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:33,188
Rule number four:
never talk about your problems

916
00:36:33,188 --> 00:36:35,097
because men don't
really listen or care.

917
00:36:35,141 --> 00:36:37,280
- Some men care.
- No, some men pretend to care.

918
00:36:37,989 --> 00:36:40,028
When we ask you how you're
doing, it's just guy code for:

919
00:36:40,068 --> 00:36:41,115
''Let me stick
my dick in your ass''.

920
00:36:41,829 --> 00:36:42,844
Ugh!

921
00:36:42,853 --> 00:36:44,860
Oh, I know you think
Colin is above it all,

922
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,690
but trust me, he's a guy.

923
00:36:46,693 --> 00:36:48,733
If he's even remotely into you,
he's probably thought about

924
00:36:48,773 --> 00:36:51,425
each one of your orifices
at least 10 times.

925
00:36:51,461 --> 00:36:54,277
I love how you assume all men
are as perverse as you are·

926
00:36:54,277 --> 00:36:57,244
Oh, I don't assume.
I know.

927
00:36:57,286 --> 00:37:00,099
Wait. We need to make
one more stop.

928
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:01,246
Why? I have tons of stuff.

929
00:37:01,286 --> 00:37:03,074
Nah, we have to make
your hair longer.

930
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:05,793
Men like something to grab onto
other than your ass.

931
00:37:05,797 --> 00:37:07,739
My hair is fine. There's
nothing wrong with my hair.

932
00:37:07,782 --> 00:37:10,597
Abby, a ponytail implies
that you are either

933
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:13,478
operating heavy machinery
or emptying the litter box.

934
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:15,420
Neither of those things
inspires an erection.

935
00:37:15,463 --> 00:37:17,405
Why is it my responsibility
to inspire an erection?

936
00:37:17,445 --> 00:37:18,494
Why isn't that his job?

937
00:37:18,534 --> 00:37:20,324
Shut up.

938
00:37:38,567 --> 00:37:42,342
Well? What do you think?

939
00:37:42,376 --> 00:37:44,164
Uh... Not bad.

940
00:37:44,166 --> 00:37:45,280
I just...

941
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:48,036
I don't wanna be perceived
as a bimbo. I mean...

942
00:37:48,072 --> 00:37:49,958
And I don't want you
to be a bimbo.

943
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,807
You have to be two people:
the saint and the sinner.

944
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:55,775
The librarian
and the stripper.

945
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:58,532
On the one hand,
you have to push the guy away

946
00:37:58,536 --> 00:37:59,713
with a cold indifference,

947
00:37:59,751 --> 00:38:04,509
on the other, you have to be
a sexually teasing tornado.

948
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:07,239
Now, we have to teach
you flirting.

949
00:38:07,273 --> 00:38:08,255
I know how to flirt.

950
00:38:08,264 --> 00:38:09,311
You know how to flirt?

951
00:38:09,353 --> 00:38:12,135
''Oh, my name's Abby,
and I love reading Tolstoy.

952
00:38:12,168 --> 00:38:15,813
I also love cats, gardening,
and romantic picnics''.

953
00:38:15,817 --> 00:38:16,929
I don't think so.

954
00:38:16,969 --> 00:38:18,911
Hey, babe,
you wearing any underwear?

955
00:38:19,625 --> 00:38:20,639
Hey, you know what?

956
00:38:20,681 --> 00:38:22,568
I wouldn't say that,
and I wouldn't grab ass.

957
00:38:22,601 --> 00:38:24,489
What's wrong
with a little ass-grabbing?

958
00:38:24,521 --> 00:38:27,369
- What's it there for if not to grab it?
- Oh!

959
00:38:27,369 --> 00:38:29,344
You're just a set of orifices
and a pair of teetahs.

960
00:38:29,418 --> 00:38:34,054
And you are a deeply,
deeply disturbed person.

961
00:38:34,088 --> 00:38:37,983
Hm. Maybe I'm just
a really good student.

962
00:38:38,025 --> 00:38:40,001
- Would you stop doing that?
- Doing what?

963
00:38:40,041 --> 00:38:44,614
Uh, running your finger
down there.

964
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:45,632
Over me.

965
00:38:45,673 --> 00:38:47,463
Why?
Is it turning you on?

966
00:38:48,682 --> 00:38:51,431
- Maybe.
- Heh.

967
00:38:51,467 --> 00:38:54,313
It's weird,
I think I kinda like it.

968
00:38:54,313 --> 00:38:56,168
Really?

969
00:38:57,099 --> 00:38:58,112
- Sucker.
- Oh, I knew it.

970
00:38:58,123 --> 00:39:00,032
- Okay, no teaching the teacher.
- Come on.

971
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:02,952
- Who is it?
- It's Colin.

972
00:39:02,987 --> 00:39:04,842
I'm not ready for this.
Am I ready for this?

973
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:07,625
- I'm not ready for this.
- Calm down. Shh!

974
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:09,762
Okay. Keep the conversation
under a minute. Now go.

975
00:39:09,771 --> 00:39:11,527
- Under a minute?
- Yes.

976
00:39:11,563 --> 00:39:13,351
Under a minute.

977
00:39:13,355 --> 00:39:16,257
No, wait, wait, wait.
Come here, come here.

978
00:39:16,298 --> 00:39:18,371
You're such an asshole.

979
00:39:20,108 --> 00:39:22,083
- Hi.
- Hey.

980
00:39:22,123 --> 00:39:24,971
- Wow, you look great.
- Oh, thanks.

981
00:39:24,971 --> 00:39:26,858
Yeah, I was just
doing the dishes.

982
00:39:26,923 --> 00:39:29,739
- So, what happened to you today?
- What'd you mean?

983
00:39:29,771 --> 00:39:31,713
Well, you put me on hold
and you never called back.

984
00:39:31,724 --> 00:39:34,407
- Oh, my God. Was that you?
- Yeah.

985
00:39:34,443 --> 00:39:36,583
- I'm so sorry.
- Ah, it's okay.

986
00:39:37,581 --> 00:39:40,231
Uh, Colin, would you mind
giving me a call later?

987
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:42,307
I'm just so busy.
Gotta get back to those dishes.

988
00:39:42,315 --> 00:39:45,034
- Abby, wait.
- What now?

989
00:39:45,996 --> 00:39:48,865
No, that's good.
Now make him suffer.

990
00:39:48,876 --> 00:39:49,858
Make him suffer. Suffer.

991
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:51,842
Abby, I was wondering
if you'd like to go

992
00:39:51,885 --> 00:39:54,635
to the Devils game
with me on Saturday.

993
00:40:00,556 --> 00:40:03,340
Go, Comets!

994
00:40:04,173 --> 00:40:05,286
ANNOUNCER
He delivers it.

995
00:40:10,893 --> 00:40:13,862
Okay, I have
a visual. Nod if you can hear me.

996
00:40:15,757 --> 00:40:18,572
Just relax.
It's gonna be fine.

997
00:40:18,606 --> 00:40:20,547
Now, do exactly
what I tell you,

998
00:40:20,557 --> 00:40:22,565
and when
I tell you to do it. Okay?

999
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:27,373
You follow baseball?
Do something noncommittal.

1000
00:40:29,197 --> 00:40:30,213
Eh. Ha-ha-ha.

1001
00:40:30,222 --> 00:40:32,010
You okay?

1002
00:40:32,047 --> 00:40:33,094
I'm fine.

1003
00:40:33,134 --> 00:40:35,076
That was a little over the top,
but nice try.

1004
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:38,893
- Well, thanks.
- For what?

1005
00:40:39,887 --> 00:40:42,735
Well, thanks for being you.

1006
00:40:42,735 --> 00:40:45,516
- Mm-hm.
- You're welcome.

1007
00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:56,014
Excuse me.

1008
00:40:56,943 --> 00:40:59,114
Oh, my God.
You're Mike Chadway.

1009
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:00,838
I love you.

1010
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,693
- Hey, buddy, what the hell?
- Dude, what the fuck?

1011
00:41:03,728 --> 00:41:04,840
- Dude, what the fuck?
- What?

1012
00:41:04,847 --> 00:41:06,702
No, no, no.
I'm not talking to you.

1013
00:41:06,735 --> 00:41:10,347
I'm not talking to you.
Okay, did I do something wrong?

1014
00:41:11,503 --> 00:41:13,260
No, stop. Listen.

1015
00:41:13,297 --> 00:41:16,297
Tell him you saw him
looking at another girl.

1016
00:41:16,304 --> 00:41:18,061
I... I saw you.

1017
00:41:18,097 --> 00:41:19,242
I saw you
looking at another girl.

1018
00:41:19,952 --> 00:41:22,123
- Who?
- That girl, right there.

1019
00:41:22,833 --> 00:41:24,043
I was trying to get us
a couple hot dogs.

1020
00:41:24,048 --> 00:41:27,824
- Oh. Okay.
- Two. Thank you.

1021
00:41:27,856 --> 00:41:30,639
Okay, we need a quick recovery.

1022
00:41:30,672 --> 00:41:31,655
Um...

1023
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:34,347
Make sure you put the hot dog

1024
00:41:34,385 --> 00:41:37,451
in your mouth nice and slowly.

1025
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,070
Men like watching

1026
00:41:41,105 --> 00:41:43,974
penis-shaped food
go into a girl's mouth.

1027
00:41:44,018 --> 00:41:45,840
- Oh!
- Oh!

1028
00:41:46,001 --> 00:41:47,757
I'm so sorry.

1029
00:41:47,793 --> 00:41:49,704
- Oh, God. I'm so, so sorry.
- No, it's okay. Really.

1030
00:41:49,746 --> 00:41:51,719
You know, I can get this out.
I'm sure I can.

1031
00:41:51,762 --> 00:41:53,735
- What kind of fabric is this?
- I don't know. Cotton?

1032
00:41:53,777 --> 00:41:55,565
Cotton. Ooh. Cotton's the worst.

1033
00:41:55,570 --> 00:41:57,545
Well, actually,
leather's the worst.

1034
00:41:57,585 --> 00:41:59,309
- After that would be suede.
- Okay.

1035
00:41:59,346 --> 00:42:01,201
- I think I can get it out.
- Abby.

1036
00:42:01,202 --> 00:42:03,242
Oh, look,
hold on. It's coming!

1037
00:42:12,722 --> 00:42:14,632
- Where?
- There. Right there.

1038
00:42:14,675 --> 00:42:17,489
Abby? Abby,
you might wanna look up.

1039
00:42:22,387 --> 00:42:24,393
Way to go, Abby.

1040
00:42:27,315 --> 00:42:29,998
Okay, I got you.
I'm in position.

1041
00:42:30,003 --> 00:42:31,018
Can't say today
was boring.

1042
00:42:31,092 --> 00:42:32,106
You're being nice.

1043
00:42:32,148 --> 00:42:34,831
- I embarrassed you.
- No.

1044
00:42:34,867 --> 00:42:36,940
You're just, uh,
not what I'm used to.

1045
00:42:37,619 --> 00:42:38,666
I know.

1046
00:42:38,739 --> 00:42:40,594
No, actually,
it's a good thing.

1047
00:42:40,596 --> 00:42:43,378
I'm used to women I can
figure out in five seconds.

1048
00:42:43,411 --> 00:42:45,322
But I can't
do that with you.

1049
00:42:48,467 --> 00:42:51,217
Now, tell him good night
and stick your tits out.

1050
00:42:51,221 --> 00:42:53,163
We're gonna give
this one last shot.

1051
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:55,887
Well, good night then.

1052
00:43:06,452 --> 00:43:08,427
That definitely made up
for my wet crotch.

1053
00:43:08,436 --> 00:43:09,452
Ha. Me too.

1054
00:43:09,492 --> 00:43:11,380
No, scratch that.
I didn't have one.

1055
00:43:11,413 --> 00:43:13,300
Yeah. Ha-ha.

1056
00:43:13,302 --> 00:43:15,025
- I'll see you later.
- Yeah.

1057
00:43:15,061 --> 00:43:16,043
- Okay.
- Bye.

1058
00:43:16,052 --> 00:43:17,199
Bye.

1059
00:43:19,125 --> 00:43:20,815
Night.

1060
00:43:20,822 --> 00:43:21,769
Night.

1061
00:43:25,878 --> 00:43:26,739
Oh!

1062
00:43:31,510 --> 00:43:33,331
You did it! You did it!
You did it!

1063
00:43:33,365 --> 00:43:34,380
I didn't do anything.
You did!

1064
00:43:34,389 --> 00:43:35,405
- It was you.
- No.

1065
00:43:35,445 --> 00:43:39,023
I mean, don't ask me why,
but I think he likes you.

1066
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:41,900
- He's such a great guy, right?
- Yeah, he's dreamy.

1067
00:43:41,943 --> 00:43:44,014
Yeah. And he fits all 10
of the criteria on my checklist.

1068
00:43:44,054 --> 00:43:45,942
Right. Though weren't items
one through nine

1069
00:43:46,005 --> 00:43:48,625
something to do with him
pretty much being gay?

1070
00:43:49,623 --> 00:43:50,670
I'm gonna ignore that,

1071
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:52,652
because I am in such
a good mood.

1072
00:43:52,695 --> 00:43:56,436
Yeah, I heard. Wet crotch.

1073
00:44:06,967 --> 00:44:08,909
Of all the primates,
bonobo monkeys

1074
00:44:08,952 --> 00:44:11,601
are the closest relatives
to human beings

1075
00:44:11,639 --> 00:44:13,614
both genetically and socially.

1076
00:44:13,623 --> 00:44:16,438
Especially when
it comes to sex.

1077
00:44:16,503 --> 00:44:18,358
They use sex
as a way to end an argument.

1078
00:44:18,391 --> 00:44:20,333
One of my favorite
techniques as well.

1079
00:44:20,344 --> 00:44:23,094
In fact, when they come upon
a new food source,

1080
00:44:23,128 --> 00:44:25,266
they have a gangbang
in order to decrease tension...

1081
00:44:25,304 --> 00:44:28,054
- Small person on-set.
- Thanks.

1082
00:44:28,056 --> 00:44:30,063
...which is something
we humans should look into.

1083
00:44:30,137 --> 00:44:32,755
No, no, no.
This is not for children.

1084
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:33,840
It's okay. I know him.

1085
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:35,670
- You do?
- Yeah.

1086
00:44:35,704 --> 00:44:38,552
...sit on their asses
all day and boss their men around.

1087
00:44:38,552 --> 00:44:42,349
Sounds like a great argument
for evolution if you ask me.

1088
00:44:42,393 --> 00:44:44,465
And that, my friends,
is the ugly truth.

1089
00:44:44,505 --> 00:44:46,293
And we're wrapped.

1090
00:44:46,297 --> 00:44:47,311
Heh-heh.
Great job, Mike.

1091
00:44:47,353 --> 00:44:49,077
Thank you.
See you guys later.

1092
00:44:51,001 --> 00:44:52,911
Yeah, I've got an adult
male bonobo monkey

1093
00:44:52,922 --> 00:44:53,936
in my pants.

1094
00:44:53,976 --> 00:44:55,920
I'd like to see that.

1095
00:44:56,826 --> 00:44:58,614
Hey. What are you
doing here?

1096
00:44:58,617 --> 00:45:01,650
I told you no watching
the show, especially live.

1097
00:45:01,688 --> 00:45:03,543
JONAH:
I need some emergency advice.

1098
00:45:03,577 --> 00:45:05,552
Tracy Mclvor asked me
to the Sadie Hawkins dance.

1099
00:45:05,594 --> 00:45:08,277
Is it dorky if I say yes?

1100
00:45:08,313 --> 00:45:09,295
Dorky?

1101
00:45:09,306 --> 00:45:12,153
Hell, no. Are you kidding?

1102
00:45:12,186 --> 00:45:15,121
You're ahead of the game.
Women are coming to you.

1103
00:45:15,163 --> 00:45:17,813
You know
how cool that is?

1104
00:45:17,851 --> 00:45:19,891
Relish
this moment, okay?

1105
00:45:19,898 --> 00:45:22,581
Now get the hell out of here.
I'll see you at 5.

1106
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:23,632
- Okay.
- We'll celebrate.

1107
00:45:23,673 --> 00:45:25,561
JONAH:
Don't forget the pizza, King Kong.

1108
00:45:25,594 --> 00:45:28,344
Hey, have I ever?

1109
00:45:28,378 --> 00:45:29,523
He lives with you?

1110
00:45:29,563 --> 00:45:33,141
Well, next door, with my sister.

1111
00:45:33,211 --> 00:45:34,324
Oh.
He's my nephew.

1112
00:45:34,362 --> 00:45:36,021
Oh.

1113
00:45:36,027 --> 00:45:37,139
- Cute kid.
- Yeah.

1114
00:45:37,179 --> 00:45:39,862
Here, uh, do me.

1115
00:45:41,050 --> 00:45:42,873
- Okay. So guess what.
- What?

1116
00:45:42,907 --> 00:45:45,842
Colin called, he wants
to get together again.

1117
00:45:47,579 --> 00:45:48,594
Oh, Lord.

1118
00:45:48,668 --> 00:45:52,530
Um, so how long should I wait
to have sex with him?

1119
00:45:52,572 --> 00:45:54,481
Well, the more you
make him beg for it,

1120
00:45:54,492 --> 00:45:57,143
the more you're gonna
keep him on the hook.

1121
00:45:57,179 --> 00:46:00,027
So do everything else but.

1122
00:46:00,059 --> 00:46:03,094
But then show him

1123
00:46:03,099 --> 00:46:06,711
that beneath that control-freak
exterior of yours,

1124
00:46:06,748 --> 00:46:09,748
that there's a sexual deviant
waiting to be unleashed.

1125
00:46:09,789 --> 00:46:13,465
No. No, I'm not
a sexual deviant. Mm-mm.

1126
00:46:13,501 --> 00:46:14,547
Good point.

1127
00:46:14,556 --> 00:46:17,306
I'm guessing you've been
out of practice for what,

1128
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:19,413
- a year?
- No.

1129
00:46:19,452 --> 00:46:21,340
- Eleven months.
- God.

1130
00:46:21,373 --> 00:46:24,121
Eleven months.
How do you live? Come on.

1131
00:46:25,981 --> 00:46:28,021
So how often do you, uh...?

1132
00:46:28,030 --> 00:46:29,938
Do I what?

1133
00:46:30,012 --> 00:46:32,762
- Do I what?
- You know,

1134
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:34,710
flick the bean?

1135
00:46:34,717 --> 00:46:35,699
What bean?

1136
00:46:35,742 --> 00:46:39,286
- Your bean. Flick it. Down there.
- Oh!

1137
00:46:39,326 --> 00:46:41,268
Gross! That's what you call it?
What is wrong with you?

1138
00:46:41,309 --> 00:46:43,219
No, well, actually,
I call it masturbating,

1139
00:46:43,262 --> 00:46:45,170
but I thought that might
offend your delicate

1140
00:46:45,215 --> 00:46:48,028
ladylike sensibilities.

1141
00:46:48,061 --> 00:46:50,068
- So how often do you flick it?
- I don't know.

1142
00:46:50,077 --> 00:46:51,833
How often do you flick it?

1143
00:46:51,871 --> 00:46:54,838
You're only asking me that so
you can picture me flicking mine

1144
00:46:54,847 --> 00:46:56,733
- while you flick yours.
- Oh, no.

1145
00:46:56,766 --> 00:46:58,675
I would never picture you
while I do that,

1146
00:46:58,717 --> 00:46:59,733
which is
not something I do.

1147
00:46:59,742 --> 00:47:01,630
- I don't do that, not ever.
- Yes, you would.

1148
00:47:02,335 --> 00:47:03,414
- No. No. No.
- Never?

1149
00:47:03,454 --> 00:47:05,494
I find it impersonal.

1150
00:47:06,175 --> 00:47:07,320
Abby, what could be
more personal

1151
00:47:07,358 --> 00:47:09,181
than you
flicking your bean?

1152
00:47:09,215 --> 00:47:11,103
I just don't see myself
that way, okay?

1153
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:14,038
Okay, well, I do.
Come here. Ahem.

1154
00:47:14,911 --> 00:47:16,023
Well, you better start.

1155
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:18,742
Because if you don't
wanna have sex with you,

1156
00:47:18,782 --> 00:47:20,822
- why the hell would Colin?
- Hm.

1157
00:47:35,967 --> 00:47:38,902
What is this?
What is this, baby?

1158
00:47:40,833 --> 00:47:42,686
What? What, baby?

1159
00:47:46,625 --> 00:47:50,518
What is this?
What is this, D'Artagnan?

1160
00:47:52,353 --> 00:47:54,240
''Astrea 1''.

1161
00:47:56,097 --> 00:47:59,893
Oh. "Vibrating brief". Wow.

1162
00:48:16,353 --> 00:48:17,335
Great.

1163
00:48:57,699 --> 00:49:00,384
He said he was running late.

1164
00:49:00,387 --> 00:49:03,202
Ugh. What is he
doing here already?

1165
00:49:13,027 --> 00:49:15,744
Good, you're ready.
For what?

1166
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:17,635
The dinner
with corporate.

1167
00:49:17,635 --> 00:49:18,715
- Didn't you get my e-mail?
- No.

1168
00:49:18,757 --> 00:49:21,539
And I can't.
I have a date with Colin.

1169
00:49:21,572 --> 00:49:23,360
You can't go because
you have a date?

1170
00:49:23,396 --> 00:49:26,429
You have no idea how hard
those are for her to get.

1171
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:30,202
Well, then let's pick
him up on the way.

1172
00:49:30,246 --> 00:49:32,155
Come on, let's go.
Right now.

1173
00:49:32,197 --> 00:49:34,106
Come on.
Come on, let's go.

1174
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:37,690
Sorry to hijack
your date, brother.

1175
00:49:37,733 --> 00:49:39,739
No worries.
You're a producer as well?

1176
00:49:39,782 --> 00:49:41,789
No, dude,
I'm the talent.

1177
00:49:42,501 --> 00:49:44,476
So you're, uh...
You're an anchor, then?

1178
00:49:44,518 --> 00:49:46,492
No, I do
The Ugly Truth.

1179
00:49:46,534 --> 00:49:48,443
Hasn't he ever seen
our show?

1180
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:50,177
Come on, Stuart.

1181
00:49:50,213 --> 00:49:52,351
Our show's way too
low-brow for Colin.

1182
00:49:53,061 --> 00:49:55,068
- He's a doctor.
- Yes.

1183
00:49:55,077 --> 00:49:56,092
That's right, he is.

1184
00:49:56,166 --> 00:49:58,076
He doesn't wanna hear about
things like implants

1185
00:49:58,117 --> 00:49:59,940
and oral sex.

1186
00:49:59,942 --> 00:50:01,731
You talk about oral sex?

1187
00:50:01,766 --> 00:50:03,588
Oh, look, we're here.

1188
00:50:04,838 --> 00:50:07,521
You invited
the Jell-O twins?

1189
00:50:07,559 --> 00:50:08,637
Yeah. I thought
it was good thinking.

1190
00:50:08,679 --> 00:50:10,501
Well, it certainly
can't hurt.

1191
00:50:10,534 --> 00:50:13,469
Ladies,
you look quite fetching.

1192
00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:18,947
Hey, hey, the gang's all here.

1193
00:50:18,983 --> 00:50:19,998
BOB:
Hey.

1194
00:50:20,007 --> 00:50:21,981
Harold, Bob, you remember Abby.
Hi. And this is...

1195
00:50:22,023 --> 00:50:23,911
And we all know Mike Chadway.

1196
00:50:23,911 --> 00:50:25,733
And who are these
lovely ladies?

1197
00:50:25,735 --> 00:50:28,637
Something tells me we won't be
talking about the news tonight.

1198
00:50:28,679 --> 00:50:29,693
That's right.

1199
00:50:30,728 --> 00:50:32,615
Our table's waiting. Shall we?

1200
00:50:33,351 --> 00:50:33,601
Come this way.

1201
00:50:33,608 --> 00:50:35,364
You're doing
a hell of a job.

1202
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:37,255
Yeah, I couldn't agree more.

1203
00:50:39,175 --> 00:50:41,150
- That's a good one, huh?
- That is funny.

1204
00:50:41,159 --> 00:50:42,981
HAROLD:
Thank you.

1205
00:50:47,753 --> 00:50:50,655
So you guys here
to give me a raise or what?

1206
00:50:52,648 --> 00:50:53,510
Ow!

1207
00:50:55,432 --> 00:50:58,302
Oh, that's my guy,
always with the jokes.

1208
00:51:01,289 --> 00:51:03,177
Yeah.

1209
00:51:03,208 --> 00:51:05,184
Yeah. Right.

1210
00:51:05,224 --> 00:51:08,836
No, really,
we are very excited

1211
00:51:08,873 --> 00:51:10,815
about this year's rating
increases. And we're hoping

1212
00:51:10,856 --> 00:51:12,864
that in the next quarter, we...

1213
00:51:12,905 --> 00:51:14,693
Oh, God.
What's wrong?

1214
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:16,516
Nothing. Nothing.

1215
00:51:18,409 --> 00:51:21,409
Um... Could you excuse me?

1216
00:51:21,449 --> 00:51:24,297
- Shit.
- Sorry, she's...

1217
00:51:28,106 --> 00:51:30,976
What are you doing?
I'm looking for the remote.

1218
00:51:31,018 --> 00:51:33,985
- What remote?
- For the... Oh!

1219
00:51:35,786 --> 00:51:37,826
The underwear.

1220
00:51:37,867 --> 00:51:38,793
What?

1221
00:51:38,827 --> 00:51:41,641
You're wearing them now?

1222
00:51:42,634 --> 00:51:44,456
Oh! Wow.

1223
00:51:44,490 --> 00:51:46,280
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1224
00:51:49,130 --> 00:51:50,146
Yeah.

1225
00:51:51,275 --> 00:51:56,032
Mm. This ceviche, it's so good.

1226
00:51:56,074 --> 00:52:00,809
Quite possibly the best
I have ever tasted. Oh.

1227
00:52:00,811 --> 00:52:02,666
Yeah. I'm gonna ask the chef
for the recipe.

1228
00:52:02,699 --> 00:52:03,746
Abby, uh, hold on.

1229
00:52:03,755 --> 00:52:06,438
Tell Harold about
the new teaser campaign

1230
00:52:06,476 --> 00:52:09,291
we're starting next week.
You're gonna love this.

1231
00:52:09,291 --> 00:52:12,226
Sure. Sure, sure, sure.

1232
00:52:16,108 --> 00:52:20,744
Well, they're, uh...
They're 15 seconds

1233
00:52:20,748 --> 00:52:23,813
every hour, on the hour.

1234
00:52:23,853 --> 00:52:26,536
Yep. Yep, yep.

1235
00:52:27,693 --> 00:52:30,474
They're so,

1236
00:52:30,509 --> 00:52:32,297
so···

1237
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:36,097
You tell them, Mike.
You should tell them. Yes, yes.

1238
00:52:36,141 --> 00:52:37,286
Yes, you tell them.

1239
00:52:37,324 --> 00:52:39,211
Actually,
I was really enjoying

1240
00:52:39,213 --> 00:52:42,791
the way you were
telling them. It was great.

1241
00:52:43,853 --> 00:52:46,722
You were...
You were telling them.

1242
00:52:46,797 --> 00:52:48,619
What's in ceviche?

1243
00:52:50,764 --> 00:52:52,456
They're, um...

1244
00:52:52,494 --> 00:52:56,268
They're unlike anything
you have ever felt.

1245
00:52:56,302 --> 00:52:57,349
Amazing.

1246
00:52:57,358 --> 00:52:59,146
And they're of...

1247
00:52:59,213 --> 00:53:01,286
Of Mike telling an ugly truth,

1248
00:53:01,293 --> 00:53:03,050
and they are just so...

1249
00:53:03,054 --> 00:53:04,963
So cutting-edge.

1250
00:53:06,797 --> 00:53:08,009
So... So fantastic.
So fantastic!

1251
00:53:08,014 --> 00:53:10,664
Oh, God!
Oh, it's so, so great!

1252
00:53:10,702 --> 00:53:13,637
Oh, God. Yeah!
You're gonna love them.

1253
00:53:17,326 --> 00:53:19,300
Well, gotta love her
enthusiasm, right?

1254
00:53:22,351 --> 00:53:26,179
I'm gonna use the restroom,

1255
00:53:26,222 --> 00:53:29,036
if you'll excuse me.

1256
00:53:30,894 --> 00:53:33,797
Sorry, buddy, that's my toy.

1257
00:53:34,831 --> 00:53:36,719
Did you know
he had it the whole time?

1258
00:53:36,719 --> 00:53:40,364
Not the whole time,
just part of the time.

1259
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:42,309
I figured I should
let you finish.

1260
00:53:42,351 --> 00:53:43,431
How kind.

1261
00:53:43,472 --> 00:53:46,221
So thanks for coming tonight.

1262
00:53:46,255 --> 00:53:47,271
To dinner.

1263
00:53:47,311 --> 00:53:50,028
- That kind of coming.
- Mm-hm.

1264
00:53:52,911 --> 00:53:56,686
He likes you, by the way.
Colin.

1265
00:53:56,688 --> 00:53:57,670
I can tell.

1266
00:53:57,711 --> 00:53:58,639
Really?

1267
00:53:58,672 --> 00:54:00,527
We ready to go?

1268
00:54:00,561 --> 00:54:01,487
Yeah.

1269
00:54:01,521 --> 00:54:03,463
- I know Abby is.
- Great.

1270
00:54:03,472 --> 00:54:04,552
Let's go.

1271
00:54:04,592 --> 00:54:07,210
- Take care. Thanks.
- Okay.

1272
00:54:14,097 --> 00:54:16,072
Well, that went well,
I think.

1273
00:54:16,112 --> 00:54:17,902
- Sure did. Let's get a drink.
- Yeah.

1274
00:54:17,936 --> 00:54:18,983
Bob and Harold...

1275
00:54:21,873 --> 00:54:24,492
¶ I got a pocket
Got a pocketful of sunshine

1276
00:54:27,472 --> 00:54:30,407

But you ain't gonna own me

1295

1320
00:56:16,949 --> 00:56:20,724
Uh-huh. Okay. Just conference me
when you get a hold of her.

1321
00:56:20,757 --> 00:56:22,668
Okay, bye. All right,

1322
00:56:22,710 --> 00:56:25,295
so we have
the balloon festival coming up

1323
00:56:25,335 --> 00:56:27,342
and I thought for sweeps,
it might be nice to do a segment

1324
00:56:27,382 --> 00:56:29,204
on how men are full of hot air.

1325
00:56:29,206 --> 00:56:31,181
- Right? It's good, right?
- Heh. No.

1326
00:56:31,253 --> 00:56:33,228
No. Well, we should still
do some stuff on location,

1327
00:56:33,239 --> 00:56:35,987
because you're great when
you're interacting with people.

1328
00:56:35,990 --> 00:56:39,820
I'm sorry, did you just
say I'm great?

1329
00:56:40,822 --> 00:56:43,637
Yeah, you kind of are.

1330
00:56:43,670 --> 00:56:46,389
Hm. Back at you, babe.

1331
00:56:48,568 --> 00:56:50,510
So tell me this.

1332
00:56:50,518 --> 00:56:54,262
Why hasn't some fancy
New York show stolen you away?

1333
00:56:54,295 --> 00:56:57,197
Oh, I much prefer
Sacramento to New York.

1334
00:56:57,239 --> 00:56:59,889
Ha. Come on.

1335
00:56:59,896 --> 00:57:01,871
You just like being
a big fish in a little pond.

1336
00:57:01,911 --> 00:57:04,726
- No. No.
- Mm.

1337
00:57:04,728 --> 00:57:06,550
And Sacramento
isn't really a pond,

1338
00:57:06,583 --> 00:57:09,617
it's more of a lake,
or even an estuary. Hm.

1339
00:57:09,655 --> 00:57:13,268
And it's a great place
to raise a family.

1340
00:57:13,304 --> 00:57:14,449
Uh, really good
school system.

1341
00:57:14,489 --> 00:57:17,139
The parks are clean
and well-maintained and safe.

1342
00:57:17,177 --> 00:57:18,257
And there's a much lower

1343
00:57:18,295 --> 00:57:20,237
divorce rate here than
there is in New York.

1344
00:57:27,864 --> 00:57:29,621
Yes, well...

1345
00:57:29,657 --> 00:57:32,625
Thank God Colin would never
be into a woman like that.

1346
00:57:32,664 --> 00:57:36,375
Oh, yeah, I forgot. Colin only
likes women of quality, huh?

1347
00:57:36,409 --> 00:57:39,192
That's a trait to be admired,
not mocked, man-whore.

1348
00:57:39,224 --> 00:57:42,291
Man-whore?
Why am I a man-whore?

1349
00:57:42,329 --> 00:57:44,217
I've seen you with
the Funbag Twins, remember?

1350
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:46,065
Saw me what?

1351
00:57:46,106 --> 00:57:49,684
What, you saw me introduce them
to some network executives?

1352
00:57:49,721 --> 00:57:50,833
They wanna be actresses, baby.

1353
00:57:50,873 --> 00:57:53,557
I mean, who am I
to kill their dream?

1354
00:57:54,585 --> 00:57:55,666
Mm, such a generous man.

1355
00:57:55,706 --> 00:57:58,356
Now, you're telling me
you've never slept with them?

1356
00:57:58,362 --> 00:58:01,231
Well, no, I didn't say that.
That's my point.

1357
00:58:01,273 --> 00:58:03,347
Men, or man-whores,

1358
00:58:03,385 --> 00:58:08,023
prefer women in slutty clothes
who suck lots of cock.

1359
00:58:08,059 --> 00:58:10,001
Every man wants that.

1360
00:58:10,010 --> 00:58:11,733
And for your information,

1361
00:58:11,771 --> 00:58:13,657
I only slept with the one
who could read.

1362
00:58:14,715 --> 00:58:16,690
Wait a second,
did you just say ''cock''?

1363
00:58:16,731 --> 00:58:18,737
Yes. Yes, I did.

1364
00:58:18,746 --> 00:58:21,528
I can say ''cock''.
You don't own the word. Cock.

1365
00:58:21,563 --> 00:58:24,246
Cock, cock, cock.

1366
00:58:24,282 --> 00:58:26,170
Okay, I got it.

1367
00:58:26,202 --> 00:58:29,018
A week ago, you were crying
at the thought of a vibrator.

1368
00:58:29,050 --> 00:58:31,190
Now you're, ''cock this,
cock that,'' cock, cock, cock.

1369
00:58:34,043 --> 00:58:35,831
You slept with Colin,
didn't you?

1370
00:58:35,835 --> 00:58:36,730
No. No.

1371
00:58:39,708 --> 00:58:41,748
We didn't. We're saving
that for this weekend.

1372
00:58:41,788 --> 00:58:45,400
He's taking me
to Lake Tahoe.

1373
00:58:47,291 --> 00:58:48,405
Wow.

1374
00:58:51,132 --> 00:58:52,059
Wow.

1375
00:58:54,141 --> 00:58:55,996
Well,

1376
00:58:56,027 --> 00:58:58,931
here's to overturning
assumptions, huh?

1377
00:59:00,733 --> 00:59:02,706
I'm really a man
of discriminating taste

1378
00:59:02,748 --> 00:59:04,603
and you're a foul-mouthed slut.

1379
00:59:04,637 --> 00:59:06,677
Thank you.

1380
00:59:09,469 --> 00:59:11,443
So there you have it.

1381
00:59:11,452 --> 00:59:15,282
Never assume a girl is easy
or assume she's a prude.

1382
00:59:15,324 --> 00:59:17,213
There are many layers
in between.

1383
00:59:17,244 --> 00:59:20,856
And it's your job, gentlemen,
to peel back those layers

1384
00:59:20,893 --> 00:59:24,788
and figure out exactly what type
of woman you're dealing with.

1385
00:59:24,829 --> 00:59:26,771
That sounded
almost enlightened.

1386
00:59:26,782 --> 00:59:30,427
Because once you do peel back
those layers, my friends,

1387
00:59:30,461 --> 00:59:32,534
her lady garden awaits.

1388
00:59:32,574 --> 00:59:34,362
And he's back.

1389
00:59:34,398 --> 00:59:36,307
And I'm pretty sure you're gonna
wanna fertilize

1390
00:59:36,349 --> 00:59:38,139
that patch of petunias.

1391
00:59:38,143 --> 00:59:40,989
Well, thanks, Mike.

1392
00:59:41,023 --> 00:59:43,869
Coming up after this message,
Javier tells us if your petunias

1393
00:59:43,869 --> 00:59:46,717
are gonna see any rainfall
this weekend.

1394
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:48,724
I sure hope mine do.

1395
00:59:48,735 --> 00:59:50,708
I wanna go home, but let's
go over the script right now.

1396
00:59:50,751 --> 00:59:54,427
Yeah, let's get it done
really quickly.

1397
00:59:54,463 --> 00:59:57,431
I'm turned on with the layers.
Want to see these layers?

1398
00:59:57,471 --> 00:59:59,193
- There he is.
- Hey, what's up?

1399
00:59:59,264 --> 01:00:01,150
Good news.
You're not gonna believe this.

1400
01:00:01,150 --> 01:00:03,005
What?
I got you on The Late Late Show

1401
01:00:03,039 --> 01:00:06,106
with Craig Ferguson.
They want you as his guest.

1402
01:00:06,143 --> 01:00:07,900
Craig Ferguson wants me
on his show?

1403
01:00:07,936 --> 01:00:08,918
Yeah.

1404
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:10,847
You're shitting me.
I am not shitting you.

1405
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:11,894
- Oh, yeah!
- We made it.

1406
01:00:14,623 --> 01:00:15,552
Yes!

1407
01:00:16,576 --> 01:00:18,550
Hi. Who are you?

1408
01:00:18,592 --> 01:00:19,518
Oh, this is Rick.

1409
01:00:19,585 --> 01:00:22,235
- I'm his agent.
- Yeah.

1410
01:00:22,239 --> 01:00:25,110
Since when do you have an agent?
And since when is it okay

1411
01:00:25,152 --> 01:00:27,998
to book Late Night without
the producer's approval?

1412
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,974
Actually, it's Late Late.
It's two ''lates''.

1413
01:00:30,016 --> 01:00:33,693
And since he became the hottest
personality on morning TV.

1414
01:00:33,728 --> 01:00:34,809
Have you seen this guy's
ratings?

1415
01:00:34,847 --> 01:00:37,782
Yes. Yes, I have.

1416
01:00:37,793 --> 01:00:39,614
Yeah, okay.
Anyways, you leave tonight.

1417
01:00:39,648 --> 01:00:40,663
- Okay.
- It's all set.

1418
01:00:40,704 --> 01:00:43,291
- How cool is this?
- Come on, let's go.

1419
01:00:45,217 --> 01:00:46,394
Aah! Oh, my God!

1420
01:00:51,936 --> 01:00:52,983
Joy said
you wanted to see me?

1421
01:00:53,025 --> 01:00:55,894
I just found out that
Mike's being offered a job

1422
01:00:55,938 --> 01:00:58,686
at a CBS affiliate in
San Francisco at twice the pay.

1423
01:00:58,722 --> 01:01:00,695
Craig Ferguson
is his audition.

1424
01:01:00,737 --> 01:01:03,552
- You can't be serious.
- Oh, I'm serious.

1425
01:01:03,554 --> 01:01:05,496
If Bob and Harold find out
about this, we're dead.

1426
01:01:05,538 --> 01:01:08,353
Now, I need you to fly out there
and talk him out of it.

1427
01:01:08,385 --> 01:01:10,175
I'm going to Lake Tahoe
this weekend.

1428
01:01:10,210 --> 01:01:12,184
Just don't let him know
that you know beforehand.

1429
01:01:12,226 --> 01:01:15,041
Go ahead and let him do the
show, and get us our publicity,

1430
01:01:15,074 --> 01:01:17,856
and then convince him
that he needs to sign on with us

1431
01:01:17,891 --> 01:01:21,719
for the next three years.
That's all we can do.

1432
01:01:30,402 --> 01:01:31,516
Stuart, I'm pulling up.

1433
01:01:31,523 --> 01:01:33,344
I'm gonna try to catch him
before he goes.

1434
01:01:33,378 --> 01:01:35,266
Okay. I'll call you back.

1435
01:01:37,027 --> 01:01:38,204
Thank you.

1436
01:01:38,244 --> 01:01:41,025
Hello,
little stupid penis face.

1437
01:01:41,059 --> 01:01:42,969
You'd be on cable access
if it weren't for me.

1438
01:01:43,010 --> 01:01:44,702
Hear you wanna move to CBS.

1439
01:01:44,739 --> 01:01:46,844
Is everything okay, miss?

1440
01:01:46,884 --> 01:01:50,594
Yes, I'm just...
I'm practicing my speech.

1441
01:01:51,556 --> 01:01:53,443
Abby?
What are you doing here?

1442
01:01:53,507 --> 01:01:55,362
I thought you were
going to Tahoe.

1443
01:01:55,396 --> 01:01:57,369
Oh. You couldn't spend a day
without me, could you?

1444
01:01:57,411 --> 01:02:01,056
Oh, yes. I just can't get enough
of your sparkling wit and charm.

1445
01:02:01,092 --> 01:02:02,947
Stuart thought you needed
a producer more

1446
01:02:02,947 --> 01:02:04,027
than I needed to get laid.

1447
01:02:04,099 --> 01:02:06,751
So come on, I gotta check in.
We leave in five minutes.

1448
01:02:06,789 --> 01:02:07,802
Wow.

1449
01:02:07,844 --> 01:02:10,713
Five minutes.
Ticktock, ticktock.

1450
01:02:10,755 --> 01:02:12,666
Yes, dear.

1451
01:02:12,708 --> 01:02:16,570
Okay, uh, so let's go over
the pre-interview questions.

1452
01:02:16,612 --> 01:02:19,394
I'm sorry you didn't get
to spend time

1453
01:02:19,396 --> 01:02:21,184
with little Colin
this weekend.

1454
01:02:21,221 --> 01:02:23,195
And by ''little,''
I don't mean undersized,

1455
01:02:23,237 --> 01:02:25,987
although I highly suspect
that's the case.

1456
01:02:26,021 --> 01:02:28,987
Colin's penis. That's what
you wanna talk about right now?

1457
01:02:28,996 --> 01:02:31,746
Because I thought maybe
we should talk about

1458
01:02:31,780 --> 01:02:33,635
what you're gonna say
on the show.

1459
01:02:33,670 --> 01:02:36,452
Yeah. Okay.

1460
01:02:36,485 --> 01:02:39,452
So tell me, Mike,
how did The Ugly Truth start?

1461
01:02:39,494 --> 01:02:41,436
Uh, well,
Mr. Irish Craig Ferguson,

1462
01:02:41,478 --> 01:02:43,333
I had a sales job

1463
01:02:43,365 --> 01:02:46,333
where I was driving around
a lot, listening to talk radio.

1464
01:02:47,045 --> 01:02:48,126
I started calling in,

1465
01:02:48,135 --> 01:02:50,981
and then I realized
I'm smarter than everybody else.

1466
01:02:51,014 --> 01:02:52,869
Just ask my producer, Abby.

1467
01:02:52,871 --> 01:02:54,724
She thinks
I'm a genius on days

1468
01:02:54,759 --> 01:02:55,871
when she's not
sexually frustrated.

1469
01:02:55,911 --> 01:02:57,766
Yes, thousands of lives

1470
01:02:57,766 --> 01:02:59,523
have been enriched
by your wisdom.

1471
01:02:59,559 --> 01:03:00,704
Excuse me, lady,

1472
01:03:00,742 --> 01:03:03,327
but you have a boyfriend
right now because of me.

1473
01:03:03,367 --> 01:03:04,447
It may have started
because of you,

1474
01:03:04,454 --> 01:03:05,469
but it's lasted because of me.

1475
01:03:05,510 --> 01:03:07,202
Great.
So you're acting like

1476
01:03:07,206 --> 01:03:09,115
your normal control-freak
psycho self again.

1477
01:03:09,159 --> 01:03:10,271
I am not a control freak.

1478
01:03:10,342 --> 01:03:12,197
When you checked
into the hotel,

1479
01:03:12,199 --> 01:03:14,916
did you or did you not
insist on getting

1480
01:03:14,951 --> 01:03:17,885
an eastern-facing room
on a floor not below 7?

1481
01:03:18,918 --> 01:03:21,668
I like rising with the sun,
and a view.

1482
01:03:23,496 --> 01:03:27,456
My point is, that Colin likes
the Mike version of Abby,

1483
01:03:27,463 --> 01:03:28,510
not the Abby version
of Abby.

1484
01:03:28,552 --> 01:03:31,302
So don't go knocking
my words of wisdom

1485
01:03:31,335 --> 01:03:34,239
when you're living proof
that they work.

1486
01:03:34,248 --> 01:03:36,898
I could be
having sex right now.

1487
01:03:36,936 --> 01:03:38,048
Right this way, please.

1488
01:03:38,088 --> 01:03:39,070
Dude, this is awesome.

1489
01:03:39,112 --> 01:03:42,690
You are about to go on
national television.

1490
01:03:42,697 --> 01:03:43,873
Okay, this isn't helping,
Rick.

1491
01:03:44,583 --> 01:03:46,623
Just, you know,
do what you always do.

1492
01:03:46,664 --> 01:03:48,487
What do I always do?

1493
01:03:48,521 --> 01:03:51,391
You, uh...
I don't know, you...

1494
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:54,215
You entertain millions of people
with your moronic ideas,

1495
01:03:54,248 --> 01:03:56,224
and they love you for it.

1496
01:03:56,264 --> 01:03:58,239
I think that may be the nicest
thing you ever said to me.

1497
01:03:58,952 --> 01:04:00,097
- You're welcome.
- Next up,

1498
01:04:00,137 --> 01:04:02,047
here to tell us the ugly truth
about men and women

1499
01:04:02,088 --> 01:04:04,838
is Mike Chadway, everybody.
Mike Chadway.

1500
01:04:06,824 --> 01:04:08,800
Mike, Mike, Mike.

1501
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:10,728
Come on up.

1502
01:04:10,730 --> 01:04:13,512
Hey, how are you, folks?

1503
01:04:13,545 --> 01:04:15,519
FERGUSON:
All right, Mike, welcome.

1504
01:04:16,233 --> 01:04:19,333
Now, listen. Men, we men,
I think I can say ''we men''.

1505
01:04:19,338 --> 01:04:22,054
Not necessarily ''wee'' men,
but men of all sizes...

1506
01:04:22,090 --> 01:04:23,016
No, I get it. I get it.

1507
01:04:23,050 --> 01:04:24,992
We're not known for
our expertise

1508
01:04:25,034 --> 01:04:26,976
in matters of the heart.

1509
01:04:26,985 --> 01:04:30,782
But I hear you have some very
interesting ideas and theories.

1510
01:04:30,826 --> 01:04:33,608
What advice would you give
to the good people out there

1511
01:04:33,643 --> 01:04:35,498
that are
looking for love?

1512
01:04:35,530 --> 01:04:37,385
My advice would be, uh:

1513
01:04:37,418 --> 01:04:38,465
Don't do it.

1514
01:04:39,498 --> 01:04:41,353
I mean,
try to find lust instead.

1515
01:04:41,355 --> 01:04:44,289
It's a lot easier
and a lot less messy.

1516
01:04:44,331 --> 01:04:46,086
Blue balls,
they only last a few hours,

1517
01:04:46,090 --> 01:04:48,840
but a broken heart,
that can last years.

1518
01:04:53,675 --> 01:04:55,617
Goodness me. Tell me, then.
What's her name?

1519
01:04:55,659 --> 01:04:56,586
Who?

1520
01:04:57,739 --> 01:05:01,514
The woman that screwed
you up. She must have been a doozy.

1521
01:05:06,347 --> 01:05:11,911
Ah. Well, like I said,
better a floozy than a doozy.

1522
01:05:15,885 --> 01:05:19,528
Hi. I was looking
for an Abby Richter.

1523
01:05:31,246 --> 01:05:33,929
Did you get him? Is he ours?

1524
01:05:33,965 --> 01:05:34,980
I'm working on it.

1525
01:05:34,989 --> 01:05:36,876
I gotta go.

1526
01:05:37,932 --> 01:05:40,650
- Where's Rick?
- I sent him home.

1527
01:05:40,717 --> 01:05:42,659
I thought maybe you and I
could celebrate on our own.

1528
01:05:42,668 --> 01:05:44,579
Here. Give me some of that.

1529
01:05:44,621 --> 01:05:47,469
And, uh, what exactly
are we celebrating?

1530
01:05:47,534 --> 01:05:50,347
Hello? Craig Ferguson?
I was just on it.

1531
01:05:50,382 --> 01:05:52,291
I mean, maybe you saw it?

1532
01:05:53,262 --> 01:05:56,043
I heard about
the offer from CBS.

1533
01:05:57,134 --> 01:05:59,884
Well, then maybe you heard
I turned it down.

1534
01:05:59,918 --> 01:06:01,773
You did?

1535
01:06:02,893 --> 01:06:04,617
Why?

1536
01:06:04,653 --> 01:06:05,603
Jonah.

1537
01:06:06,637 --> 01:06:08,547
You know,
he needs me around.

1538
01:06:09,518 --> 01:06:12,387
I may not be the best
father figure out there,

1539
01:06:12,429 --> 01:06:14,318
but I'm the only one he's got.

1540
01:06:14,318 --> 01:06:18,094
And I don't wanna half-ass it
all the way from San Francisco.

1541
01:06:18,126 --> 01:06:21,161
Well, I think that's
a very good decision.

1542
01:06:21,199 --> 01:06:22,856
Thank you.

1543
01:06:22,862 --> 01:06:24,773
Now, can we stop
talking about work

1544
01:06:24,815 --> 01:06:29,605
and maybe relax
and drink, enjoy?

1545
01:06:29,648 --> 01:06:30,574
God.

1546
01:06:32,559 --> 01:06:33,639
Tell me about the doozy.

1547
01:06:34,318 --> 01:06:36,490
You know, the woman
who broke your heart.

1548
01:06:36,527 --> 01:06:39,342
You are just totally
trying to kill my buzz.

1549
01:06:39,376 --> 01:06:42,244
No, I'm not. I'm just interested
in what makes you you.

1550
01:06:45,007 --> 01:06:47,791
Well,
for your information,

1551
01:06:47,824 --> 01:06:50,858
it was, uh...
It was more than just one.

1552
01:06:50,864 --> 01:06:54,693
It was more like a parade.

1553
01:06:54,735 --> 01:06:58,510
Co-dependent girls,
unfaithful girls,

1554
01:06:58,545 --> 01:07:00,300
depressed girls,

1555
01:07:00,304 --> 01:07:03,173
narcissistic girls,
phony girls.

1556
01:07:03,217 --> 01:07:06,992
Girls who, it turned out,
didn't actually like me.

1557
01:07:08,081 --> 01:07:10,862
By the time I hit 30,
I realized that, uh,

1558
01:07:10,896 --> 01:07:12,784
you can only have
so many lousy relationships

1559
01:07:12,817 --> 01:07:13,764
before you figure out

1560
01:07:13,809 --> 01:07:15,565
there's no such thing
as a good one.

1561
01:07:15,601 --> 01:07:17,608
Oh, come on. You can't really
believe there's no such thing

1562
01:07:17,681 --> 01:07:19,536
as a good relationship.

1563
01:07:19,570 --> 01:07:22,505
Mm. To my very core.

1564
01:07:24,432 --> 01:07:26,157
Hello. Can I
get you something?

1565
01:07:26,193 --> 01:07:28,103
I'll have one of those, please.
A mojito. Sure.

1566
01:07:28,146 --> 01:07:30,186
Would you like anything else?
Yeah, some water.

1567
01:07:30,193 --> 01:07:32,943
Okay, would you like
still or sparkling?

1568
01:07:32,978 --> 01:07:35,793
- Tap water's great. Thanks.
- Tap. All right.

1569
01:07:36,755 --> 01:07:37,737
What?

1570
01:07:37,777 --> 01:07:39,719
What?

1571
01:07:39,731 --> 01:07:42,447
It's the exact same thing,
isn't it?

1572
01:07:43,634 --> 01:07:46,503
So I've been told.

1573
01:07:49,139 --> 01:07:50,317
Come on, let's dance.

1574
01:07:50,353 --> 01:07:53,038
No, I'm serious.

1575
01:07:53,074 --> 01:07:55,922
I've seen your spazzy dance,
now I wanna see the real thing.

1576
01:07:55,987 --> 01:07:57,896
No, really.
I can't dance like that.

1577
01:07:57,938 --> 01:07:59,760
I can. Well, kind of.

1578
01:08:03,731 --> 01:08:05,673
Ugh. Mike, no.

1579
01:08:05,682 --> 01:08:06,666
No.

1580
01:08:22,931 --> 01:08:24,841
¶ The way you walk
The way you talk

1581
01:08:24,853 --> 01:08:26,795
¶ The way you smile
It turns me on

1582
01:08:26,836 --> 01:08:28,722
¶ The way you move
The way you groove

1583
01:08:28,724 --> 01:08:31,342
¶ Makes me glad
That I'm with you

1584
01:08:31,381 --> 01:08:32,525
¶ The way you walk
The way you talk

1585
01:08:32,564 --> 01:08:34,452
¶ The way you smile
It turns me on

1586
01:08:34,484 --> 01:08:36,372
¶ The way you move
The way you groove

1587
01:08:36,404 --> 01:08:40,048
¶ Makes me glad
That I'm with you

1588
01:09:09,014 --> 01:09:10,923
¶ The way you walk
The way you talk

1589
01:09:11,637 --> 01:09:13,613
¶ The way you smile
It turns me on

1590
01:09:13,622 --> 01:09:15,478
¶ The way you move
The way you groove

1591
01:09:15,510 --> 01:09:17,398
¶ Makes me glad
That I'm with you

1592
01:09:17,430 --> 01:09:18,608
¶ The way you walk
The way you talk

1593
01:09:19,286 --> 01:09:21,228
¶ The way you smile

1594
01:09:21,270 --> 01:09:23,158
¶ The way you move

1595
01:09:23,158 --> 01:09:25,166
¶ Makes me glad
That I'm with you

1596
01:09:33,846 --> 01:09:38,582
We have an early flight
tomorrow. We should go.

1597
01:09:42,487 --> 01:09:45,203
Yeah. We should go.

1598
01:10:13,145 --> 01:10:16,942
So the car is gonna pick us
up downstairs tomorrow at 8.

1599
01:10:16,953 --> 01:10:19,854
Do you want me to call you?
No, I'll get a wake-up call.

1600
01:10:19,896 --> 01:10:21,806
- Oh, yeah, good idea.
- Yeah.

1601
01:10:25,497 --> 01:10:26,545
I had a really good time
tonight.

1602
01:10:26,586 --> 01:10:28,472
Me too.

1603
01:10:28,506 --> 01:10:30,360
Yeah.

1604
01:10:38,009 --> 01:10:39,896
- My floor.
- Yeah.

1605
01:10:39,930 --> 01:10:41,904
- See you tomorrow.
- Eight o'clock.

1606
01:10:41,945 --> 01:10:43,889
Eight o'clock.

1607
01:10:43,898 --> 01:10:46,614
- Good night.
- Good night. Oh!

1608
01:10:48,506 --> 01:10:50,612
- Good night.
- Yeah, good night.

1609
01:10:53,337 --> 01:10:55,225
- A lot of fun. Yeah.
- Yeah. Yeah. Oh.

1610
01:11:10,747 --> 01:11:12,470
I guess, uh,

1611
01:11:12,507 --> 01:11:14,547
I guess I should go, huh?

1612
01:11:14,555 --> 01:11:15,569
Yeah.

1613
01:11:17,307 --> 01:11:19,347
Good night.

1614
01:11:40,475 --> 01:11:44,121
What the hell was that?

1615
01:11:44,155 --> 01:11:47,003
Why do I wanna do it again?

1616
01:11:58,716 --> 01:12:00,506
- Miss me?
- Colin.

1617
01:12:00,541 --> 01:12:02,329
You were expecting
someone else?

1618
01:12:02,364 --> 01:12:03,346
No.

1619
01:12:03,453 --> 01:12:04,500
- Mm.
- Uh...

1620
01:12:05,213 --> 01:12:06,391
Since you couldn't
come to Lake Tahoe,

1621
01:12:06,430 --> 01:12:08,340
I decided to come to you.

1622
01:12:08,381 --> 01:12:11,131
Oh. How did you
know I was here?

1623
01:12:11,132 --> 01:12:12,082
Uh, Joy told me.

1624
01:12:12,126 --> 01:12:13,849
I just started
thinking about

1625
01:12:13,854 --> 01:12:15,828
all the stuff we were
going to do there, and I...

1626
01:12:15,869 --> 01:12:19,645
- Come here.
- decided I couldn't wait.

1627
01:12:19,677 --> 01:12:20,725
- A little champagne?
- Yeah.

1628
01:12:20,797 --> 01:12:21,747
Great.

1629
01:12:22,751 --> 01:12:25,565
- So happy to be here.
- Oh, yes.

1630
01:12:25,567 --> 01:12:27,453
What's wrong?

1631
01:12:27,487 --> 01:12:30,235
Nothing.
You just surprised me.

1632
01:12:30,270 --> 01:12:32,092
You told me you were
spontaneous.

1633
01:12:32,127 --> 01:12:33,207
Yes, I did.

1634
01:12:33,247 --> 01:12:35,930
Have a little something else
on its way up for you.

1635
01:12:35,935 --> 01:12:37,079
You are going to love it.

1636
01:12:38,974 --> 01:12:39,988
- Oh! Whoa! Ha-ha!
- Whoa!

1637
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:42,676
Let me tell you,
it comes out so fast, right?

1638
01:12:42,719 --> 01:12:45,752
Oh, wow, I guess we'll have to
get naked sooner than I thought.

1639
01:12:46,462 --> 01:12:47,576
- I'll get you a towel.
- Okay.

1640
01:12:58,912 --> 01:13:00,820
Abby, I...

1641
01:13:03,007 --> 01:13:06,586
Abby, I really,
really wanna do that again,

1642
01:13:06,623 --> 01:13:07,703
and not just tonight.

1643
01:13:07,712 --> 01:13:09,501
Fuck!

1644
01:13:09,537 --> 01:13:11,609
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

1645
01:13:11,648 --> 01:13:15,422
Man up, Chadway.
Come on, you can do this.

1646
01:13:22,912 --> 01:13:25,847
Hey, hey.
You're not room service.

1647
01:13:25,889 --> 01:13:27,895
- How you doing, man?
- Hey. Uh...

1648
01:13:27,904 --> 01:13:30,654
Hey. Good to see you.
I, uh...

1649
01:13:30,689 --> 01:13:34,430
I just came by to tell
Abby about the change

1650
01:13:34,465 --> 01:13:35,643
in our flight time,

1651
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:39,167
but I can come by later.

1652
01:13:39,201 --> 01:13:40,149
Hi.

1653
01:13:40,257 --> 01:13:41,305
Hey.

1654
01:13:41,345 --> 01:13:43,287
What are you doing here?

1655
01:13:44,001 --> 01:13:45,179
Uh, flight's changed.

1656
01:13:45,216 --> 01:13:48,862
Eight o'clock in the morning.

1657
01:13:48,898 --> 01:13:51,680
I... I told you that already?

1658
01:13:51,938 --> 01:13:56,444
Uh, I'm so...
Long day, big day.

1659
01:13:56,514 --> 01:13:58,587
Okay, I'll just leave now.

1660
01:14:07,105 --> 01:14:08,185
Mike. Mike.

1661
01:14:08,194 --> 01:14:10,813
Hey, wait.

1662
01:14:12,034 --> 01:14:14,685
He came to surprise me. I...

1663
01:14:14,690 --> 01:14:16,698
Hey, how convenient.

1664
01:14:16,738 --> 01:14:17,819
No, I...

1665
01:14:18,530 --> 01:14:20,472
I thought it was you
at the door.

1666
01:14:20,515 --> 01:14:22,457
Well, I guess we're all
interchangeable.

1667
01:14:24,354 --> 01:14:26,297
I taught you well.

1668
01:14:26,306 --> 01:14:28,282
Hey, maybe you could
even host the show.

1669
01:14:36,802 --> 01:14:39,770
Tell me what happened
in the elevator.

1670
01:14:39,811 --> 01:14:41,787
Should I tell Colin to go?

1671
01:14:46,372 --> 01:14:48,346
No, why pull up anchor now?

1672
01:14:48,387 --> 01:14:51,257
I mean, you worked damn hard
to get him here.

1673
01:14:53,091 --> 01:14:56,921
And that's it?
That's all you have to say?

1674
01:14:57,957 --> 01:14:59,899
What do you want me to say?

1675
01:15:01,796 --> 01:15:03,706
The truth is ugly, isn't it?

1676
01:15:04,773 --> 01:15:06,682
That's what I've been
trying to tell you.

1677
01:15:06,756 --> 01:15:08,416
Hm.

1678
01:15:11,462 --> 01:15:13,217
I'll see you.

1679
01:15:39,109 --> 01:15:40,222
Sorry about that.

1680
01:15:40,293 --> 01:15:43,872
No. Honestly, no worries.

1681
01:15:43,909 --> 01:15:44,989
Just come here.

1682
01:15:46,055 --> 01:15:49,632
Listen, the rest
of the night is ours. Hm?

1683
01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:53,599
To the first of many
romantic evenings to come.

1684
01:15:56,614 --> 01:15:59,201
Whoa. Uh...

1685
01:15:59,238 --> 01:16:00,287
Okay.

1686
01:16:02,344 --> 01:16:04,962
Mm. Yeah.

1687
01:16:04,998 --> 01:16:07,934
Colin, why do you like me?

1688
01:16:08,966 --> 01:16:09,895
Oh, heh.

1689
01:16:11,720 --> 01:16:12,667
Wow. Uh...

1690
01:16:12,711 --> 01:16:14,783
You're beautiful.

1691
01:16:14,823 --> 01:16:16,579
You're smart.

1692
01:16:16,615 --> 01:16:18,438
You, uh...

1693
01:16:18,439 --> 01:16:20,327
You never criticize.

1694
01:16:20,391 --> 01:16:22,463
You know what? You never
try to control the situation.

1695
01:16:22,505 --> 01:16:25,407
And I've gotta say,
it's a breath of fresh air

1696
01:16:26,088 --> 01:16:29,023
because I know so many women
who are total control freaks,

1697
01:16:29,032 --> 01:16:29,960
and it's a nightmare.

1698
01:16:30,024 --> 01:16:31,998
And I just love that
you're not like that.

1699
01:16:32,007 --> 01:16:32,989
But I am.

1700
01:16:33,032 --> 01:16:35,682
I am just like that.

1701
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:37,608
Wait, what do you mean?

1702
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:39,648
Well, this should be chilled.

1703
01:16:39,688 --> 01:16:41,511
And you know that.

1704
01:16:41,545 --> 01:16:44,359
And, uh,
as horrible as it sounds,

1705
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:46,216
I was editing that speech

1706
01:16:46,248 --> 01:16:47,328
the entire time
you were giving it.

1707
01:16:47,368 --> 01:16:50,118
And the time you fed me caviar,

1708
01:16:50,121 --> 01:16:52,194
I was in physical pain.

1709
01:16:52,233 --> 01:16:54,983
I hate being fed
like a toddler.

1710
01:16:55,016 --> 01:16:57,024
That's how much
of a control freak I am.

1711
01:16:57,737 --> 01:17:00,640
But I couldn't show you
any of that, because

1712
01:17:00,649 --> 01:17:02,755
who would love
someone like that?

1713
01:17:02,826 --> 01:17:04,614
No one.

1714
01:17:09,481 --> 01:17:10,463
Um...

1715
01:17:21,707 --> 01:17:23,713
I'm so sorry.

1716
01:17:23,753 --> 01:17:26,623
You are a great guy,
you really are.

1717
01:17:26,667 --> 01:17:31,304
Which is why I have to tell you
that I have not been myself.

1718
01:17:31,338 --> 01:17:34,185
Not for one second of the time
that we've been dating.

1719
01:17:34,219 --> 01:17:37,065
Then who have you been?

1720
01:17:39,019 --> 01:17:41,867
The girl some idiot
told me to be.

1721
01:18:07,051 --> 01:18:09,703
Morning, Freddy.

1722
01:18:10,765 --> 01:18:12,619
What did you do to him?

1723
01:18:12,653 --> 01:18:13,601
I didn't do anything.

1724
01:18:13,645 --> 01:18:15,432
He missed the flight
all on his own.

1725
01:18:15,469 --> 01:18:17,444
He quit this morning.

1726
01:18:17,484 --> 01:18:19,460
I just got a smug call
from the local CBS affiliate

1727
01:18:19,501 --> 01:18:21,289
saying they'd closed
a deal with him.

1728
01:18:21,324 --> 01:18:24,074
Corporate's having a shit fit.
What the hell happened?

1729
01:18:24,078 --> 01:18:27,011
He quit to go to one
of our local competitors?

1730
01:18:28,877 --> 01:18:29,957
We don't need Mike Chadway.

1731
01:18:29,965 --> 01:18:31,939
Halfwit troglodytes
are a dime a dozen.

1732
01:18:32,012 --> 01:18:33,671
You'd better be right.

1733
01:18:33,710 --> 01:18:34,636
Because you gotta find me
another one

1734
01:18:34,670 --> 01:18:36,645
by the end of the week
or else we're cancelled.

1735
01:18:36,654 --> 01:18:39,404
I'll find one
by the end of the day.

1736
01:18:39,438 --> 01:18:42,471
Not really. I'm just...
That's just a joke, everybody.

1737
01:18:42,510 --> 01:18:45,194
I can't believe I allowed myself
to feel anything for him.

1738
01:18:45,229 --> 01:18:47,204
Well, you felt enough something
to break up with Colin.

1739
01:18:47,246 --> 01:18:49,034
I'm sorry.

1740
01:18:49,038 --> 01:18:50,980
Okay, here are the
Mike Chadway replacements.

1741
01:18:51,021 --> 01:18:52,931
Yes, no, yes, no, no,

1742
01:18:52,975 --> 01:18:54,949
fuck no.
''Fuck no''. All right.

1743
01:18:54,957 --> 01:18:57,828
So, what do you think
of the new set?

1744
01:18:57,871 --> 01:18:59,659
I love it.

1745
01:18:59,694 --> 01:19:03,372
KSXP retained the copyright
to your old segment title,

1746
01:19:03,407 --> 01:19:07,269
so we retitled you:
Morning Madness With Mike.

1747
01:19:08,367 --> 01:19:09,349
Love it.

1748
01:19:09,422 --> 01:19:12,041
And this is Joe,
your new producer.

1749
01:19:12,046 --> 01:19:13,029
Hi.

1750
01:19:14,990 --> 01:19:16,998
You know what I like
best about you, Joe?

1751
01:19:17,038 --> 01:19:19,756
Is I don't wanna
have sex with you at all.

1752
01:19:19,792 --> 01:19:21,645
I'm relieved
to hear that.

1753
01:19:24,655 --> 01:19:29,292
¶ Givin' myself to you is like
Givin' myself to chainsaw

1754
01:19:29,296 --> 01:19:30,474
¶ You keep cuttin' me open
Why?

1755
01:19:30,511 --> 01:19:34,157
¶ Is that the only thing
That you're good for?

1756
01:19:34,192 --> 01:19:38,153
¶ Givin' myself to you is like
Givin' myself to a chainsaw

1757
01:19:38,863 --> 01:19:40,838
¶ You keep cuttin' me open
Why?

1758
01:19:40,847 --> 01:19:42,887
¶ Is that the only thing
That you're good for?

1759
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:52,488
How's my face?
Is it too shiny?

1760
01:19:52,529 --> 01:19:56,326
Which side is better?
Right, left, full frontal?

1761
01:19:56,368 --> 01:19:58,224
They're all great.

1762
01:19:58,225 --> 01:20:00,199
Can we go over your intro
one more time?

1763
01:20:00,240 --> 01:20:03,023
''I'm Jack Magnum,
and this is.. ''.

1764
01:20:03,024 --> 01:20:05,895
The Ugly Truth.

1765
01:20:07,632 --> 01:20:10,536
Okay. Let's, uh,
maybe lose the gun thing.

1766
01:20:10,545 --> 01:20:12,649
What? Gun's my signature move.

1767
01:20:12,689 --> 01:20:14,577
Unless the NRA is paying
your mortgage this month,

1768
01:20:14,609 --> 01:20:16,399
I say lose
the effing gun.

1769
01:20:16,434 --> 01:20:20,208
All right, we're live
in five, four, three...

1770
01:20:20,243 --> 01:20:22,096
Two, one.

1771
01:20:22,097 --> 01:20:23,211
Think this guy's any good?

1772
01:20:23,250 --> 01:20:25,038
He better be.

1773
01:20:25,073 --> 01:20:29,743
I'm Jack Magnum,
and this is The Ugly Truth.

1774
01:20:29,779 --> 01:20:31,634
Peace.

1775
01:20:31,634 --> 01:20:32,811
Oh, Jesus.
He's going political.

1776
01:20:32,850 --> 01:20:35,533
Okay, so we'll do a couple
questions with the balloon pilot

1777
01:20:35,538 --> 01:20:37,394
about how often
couples get it on

1778
01:20:37,426 --> 01:20:38,506
in-flight,
and then we're out.

1779
01:20:38,546 --> 01:20:39,439
Got it.

1780
01:20:41,234 --> 01:20:42,412
Check it out.
Your replacement's on.

1781
01:20:43,122 --> 01:20:44,268
GEORGIA:... Jack Magnum.
My what?

1782
01:20:44,274 --> 01:20:46,992
How's it going out there?
Your replacement?

1783
01:20:47,027 --> 01:20:48,881
Most of you
are watching this show

1784
01:20:48,914 --> 01:20:50,028
so you can learn how
to get chicks.

1785
01:20:50,067 --> 01:20:53,743
Well, let me assure you,
you're in good hands.

1786
01:20:53,779 --> 01:20:55,721
You're looking at a guy

1787
01:20:55,764 --> 01:20:59,658
who personally has had sex
with over 137 women.

1788
01:20:59,699 --> 01:21:01,456
Most of them conscious.

1789
01:21:03,283 --> 01:21:05,225
This is beautiful.

1790
01:21:05,268 --> 01:21:06,412
Now, we're here
at the balloon festival

1791
01:21:07,091 --> 01:21:08,237
and I'm supposed
to be telling you about

1792
01:21:08,275 --> 01:21:09,966
how men are full of hot air.

1793
01:21:10,003 --> 01:21:11,117
But I think we all know,

1794
01:21:11,125 --> 01:21:12,979
it's the ladies
that are full of crap.

1795
01:21:13,011 --> 01:21:16,841
Just because she says no,
doesn't mean she means no.

1796
01:21:16,851 --> 01:21:18,827
If that were the case,

1797
01:21:18,868 --> 01:21:20,559
I'd have only 90 women...

1798
01:21:22,452 --> 01:21:23,434
Okay. All right.

1799
01:21:23,476 --> 01:21:24,524
What the hell?

1800
01:21:24,564 --> 01:21:26,453
Did she...? Oh.

1801
01:21:26,484 --> 01:21:28,208
- Uh...
- Welcome back.

1802
01:21:28,212 --> 01:21:31,246
It looks like we're experiencing
some technical difficulty.

1803
01:21:31,284 --> 01:21:34,132
Yeah, when you have
a wine festival...

1804
01:21:34,166 --> 01:21:36,074
Okay, I got it.

1805
01:21:36,086 --> 01:21:37,873
Unh. Hi.

1806
01:21:37,908 --> 01:21:38,923
- Uh...
- We're back.

1807
01:21:38,966 --> 01:21:40,787
I'm sorry,

1808
01:21:40,853 --> 01:21:44,782
but Jack Magnum will no longer
be able to do The Ugly Truth.

1809
01:21:45,462 --> 01:21:47,404
Which should really
come as no surprise

1810
01:21:47,445 --> 01:21:50,511
because men
are completely unreliable.

1811
01:21:51,221 --> 01:21:53,197
What is she doing?

1812
01:21:53,206 --> 01:21:56,140
Yes? Yes, Harold? Yes. Yes,
I know. We're fixing it.

1813
01:21:56,181 --> 01:21:57,970
Take Mike Chadway,
for instance.

1814
01:21:58,006 --> 01:22:00,908
He up and quit the show
without so much as a word.

1815
01:22:00,949 --> 01:22:02,891
You think you know what men
are gonna do,

1816
01:22:02,934 --> 01:22:04,876
you think you know
what men want to do.

1817
01:22:04,886 --> 01:22:06,774
But when it comes right down
to that moment

1818
01:22:06,806 --> 01:22:08,595
where they actually need
to step up

1819
01:22:08,630 --> 01:22:10,539
and, I don't know,
make a move,

1820
01:22:10,582 --> 01:22:12,372
they chicken out.

1821
01:22:12,407 --> 01:22:14,479
Oh. I am all over this.

1822
01:22:14,487 --> 01:22:17,171
Where're you going?
We're live in two!

1823
01:22:17,238 --> 01:22:18,220
It's going great, isn't it?

1824
01:22:18,230 --> 01:22:20,948
The big, strong, brave men

1825
01:22:20,983 --> 01:22:22,063
that we've all been
reading about

1826
01:22:22,103 --> 01:22:24,819
in novels and watching in movies
since we were 9 years old,

1827
01:22:24,854 --> 01:22:26,895
that's a fallacy.
They don't exist.

1828
01:22:26,904 --> 01:22:30,645
Men are not strong.
Men are not brave.

1829
01:22:30,679 --> 01:22:32,502
Men are afraid.

1830
01:22:32,534 --> 01:22:33,582
It's all part of the show.

1831
01:22:33,623 --> 01:22:35,511
Sort of an Andy Kaufman
thing we're doing.

1832
01:22:35,543 --> 01:22:41,207
Even if they have a moment
in a hotel elevator, and...

1833
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,975
and it's totally romantic
and full of potential,

1834
01:22:44,984 --> 01:22:48,018
men are incapable
of copping to it.

1835
01:22:48,055 --> 01:22:50,673
Because why?

1836
01:22:50,712 --> 01:22:51,792
Men are weak.

1837
01:22:51,832 --> 01:22:55,542
Let me tell you something
about women.

1838
01:22:55,545 --> 01:22:56,623
Oh. Hey.

1839
01:22:56,664 --> 01:23:00,439
Woman would have us believe
that they are the victims.

1840
01:23:00,440 --> 01:23:02,382
That we break
their hearts for sport.

1841
01:23:02,425 --> 01:23:04,213
I thought he quit.
That's crap.

1842
01:23:04,248 --> 01:23:06,224
See, Bob?
I told you we'd get him back.

1843
01:23:06,265 --> 01:23:08,020
They say they want true love,

1844
01:23:08,056 --> 01:23:10,030
but all they want
is a checklist.

1845
01:23:10,073 --> 01:23:13,935
Is he perfect? Is he handsome?
Is he a doctor?

1846
01:23:14,649 --> 01:23:15,761
For you men who fit
the criteria,

1847
01:23:15,801 --> 01:23:18,649
don't kid yourselves,
they're not sleeping with you.

1848
01:23:18,649 --> 01:23:21,497
They're sleeping with
a carefully calculated

1849
01:23:21,497 --> 01:23:23,385
set of venal choices.

1850
01:23:23,417 --> 01:23:26,287
Money over substance,
looks over soul.

1851
01:23:26,362 --> 01:23:28,248
Polish over principles.

1852
01:23:28,250 --> 01:23:31,097
No gesture,
no matter how real or romantic,

1853
01:23:31,130 --> 01:23:32,886
will ever compensate

1854
01:23:32,921 --> 01:23:34,929
for a really impressive list
of credentials.

1855
01:23:34,970 --> 01:23:37,720
This coming from a man
who's never made a gesture

1856
01:23:37,755 --> 01:23:38,835
other than this one.

1857
01:23:38,873 --> 01:23:40,815
Oh, so the elevator
wasn't a gesture?

1858
01:23:41,498 --> 01:23:43,408
The elevator
was a moment of passion,

1859
01:23:43,451 --> 01:23:46,353
followed by a moment of panic
on your part, apparently.

1860
01:23:46,395 --> 01:23:49,176
- Panic? I came by your room.
- Yes...

1861
01:23:49,211 --> 01:23:50,389
and then you ran away.

1862
01:23:50,426 --> 01:23:52,248
That wasn't panic,
sweetheart.

1863
01:23:52,251 --> 01:23:54,105
That was
an unwillingness to compete

1864
01:23:54,139 --> 01:23:56,985
with the walking checklist
that was in your bed.

1865
01:23:57,019 --> 01:23:58,033
You should be thanking me.

1866
01:23:58,074 --> 01:23:59,765
Uh, we got 10 seconds.

1867
01:23:59,802 --> 01:24:02,704
Are we ready to soar
up, up and away?

1868
01:24:02,747 --> 01:24:05,561
Well, there you have it, folks.
That's the ugly truth.

1869
01:24:05,595 --> 01:24:07,451
A girl in heat for two guys

1870
01:24:07,452 --> 01:24:09,426
will always choose the one
with the better résumé.

1871
01:24:09,467 --> 01:24:11,289
That is bullsh...

1872
01:24:12,315 --> 01:24:15,163
And we're out.

1873
01:24:15,195 --> 01:24:18,043
God. I hate you so much,
I just swore on live television.

1874
01:24:18,043 --> 01:24:20,979
No, you hate yourself
for being so shallow.

1875
01:24:21,020 --> 01:24:22,875
- Off we go.
- Where're we going?

1876
01:24:22,908 --> 01:24:24,729
I'm not going anywhere
with you.

1877
01:24:24,764 --> 01:24:26,706
Whoa.

1878
01:24:26,716 --> 01:24:29,586
Oh. Well, that's a shocker,
you're bailing.

1879
01:24:29,627 --> 01:24:30,643
I wouldn't recommend that.

1880
01:24:30,684 --> 01:24:33,400
Keep rolling
on the onboard camera.

1881
01:24:35,484 --> 01:24:40,088
What're you doing?
God, what is wrong with you?

1882
01:24:43,132 --> 01:24:45,783
They don't even know
they're on the air, do they?

1883
01:24:45,822 --> 01:24:46,868
Uh-uh.

1884
01:24:46,877 --> 01:24:48,765
Is there any way to tell them
they're on the air?

1885
01:24:48,797 --> 01:24:49,845
Nope.

1886
01:24:49,885 --> 01:24:52,470
Oh, they're gonna curse.
I know it.

1887
01:25:04,253 --> 01:25:07,036
So who
wants champagne?

1888
01:25:07,997 --> 01:25:09,908
Oh, I know.
I got a great idea.

1889
01:25:09,949 --> 01:25:12,667
Why don't we pass the time
with you telling me

1890
01:25:12,670 --> 01:25:15,518
how much fun you and Colin had
having sex in Los Angeles?

1891
01:25:15,582 --> 01:25:17,654
I broke up with Colin
in Los Angeles, you jackass.

1892
01:25:17,694 --> 01:25:20,313
On our left, you'll see
the High Sierras...

1893
01:25:20,350 --> 01:25:21,398
What?

1894
01:25:21,439 --> 01:25:23,293
Oh, yeah.
That's got your interest.

1895
01:25:23,326 --> 01:25:25,365
Well, if you think we're gonna
finish what we started in LA,

1896
01:25:26,046 --> 01:25:28,054
you're out of your mind.
You lost your chance.

1897
01:25:28,095 --> 01:25:30,037
Oh, come on.
I never had a chance with you.

1898
01:25:30,078 --> 01:25:33,014
And to our right here, you'll
see the lovely Sacramento River

1899
01:25:33,726 --> 01:25:35,832
winding its way through
the dichromatic landscape.

1900
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:37,782
Could you please stop talking?
Thank you.

1901
01:25:37,823 --> 01:25:40,506
You're right. I had a momentary
lapse in judgment

1902
01:25:40,543 --> 01:25:42,519
when I thought you were more
than you are, but you aren't.

1903
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:43,507
Clearly.

1904
01:25:43,551 --> 01:25:45,405
Oh, yeah?
Well, what does that mean?

1905
01:25:45,439 --> 01:25:47,327
''I'm Mike Chadway.
I like girls in Jell-O.

1906
01:25:47,359 --> 01:25:50,971
I like to fuck like a monkey.
Don't fall in love, it's scary''.

1907
01:25:51,006 --> 01:25:53,113
Oh, for God's sakes,
there's the first one.

1908
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:56,984
Yeah, it is scary.
It's terrifying.

1909
01:25:57,695 --> 01:25:59,801
Especially when I'm in love
with a psycho like you.

1910
01:25:59,841 --> 01:26:01,530
I am not a psycho.

1911
01:26:01,568 --> 01:26:03,422
Love?

1912
01:26:03,456 --> 01:26:04,438
Oh!

1913
01:26:04,511 --> 01:26:05,560
I just told you
that I loved you,

1914
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:07,488
and all you heard was ''psycho''.

1915
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:09,342
You're the definition
of neurotic.

1916
01:26:09,377 --> 01:26:10,390
No.
The definition of neurotic

1917
01:26:10,432 --> 01:26:13,149
is a person who suffers from
anxiety, obsessive thoughts,

1918
01:26:13,185 --> 01:26:15,073
compulsive acts
and physical ailments

1919
01:26:15,073 --> 01:26:16,860
without any objective
evidence of...

1920
01:26:16,896 --> 01:26:18,042
Shut up.

1921
01:26:18,048 --> 01:26:20,699
Yet again, I just told
you I'm in love with you,

1922
01:26:20,737 --> 01:26:22,876
and you're standing here
giving me a vocabulary lesson.

1923
01:26:34,402 --> 01:26:37,086
You're in love with me.

1924
01:26:37,122 --> 01:26:38,048
Why?

1925
01:26:41,122 --> 01:26:43,707
Beats the shit outta me,

1926
01:26:43,746 --> 01:26:45,655
but I am.

1927
01:27:11,555 --> 01:27:12,765
Oh! Oh, Mike.

1928
01:27:14,467 --> 01:27:16,573
- You're amazing.
- Ah, I am?

1929
01:27:16,610 --> 01:27:19,360
Oh, you're a god. Oh!

1930
01:27:19,363 --> 01:27:21,305
- Really?
- Oh, God!

1931
01:27:31,684 --> 01:27:32,730
Am I really that good?

1932
01:27:32,771 --> 01:27:34,658
Or are you...?

1933
01:27:34,659 --> 01:27:36,448
Are you just faking it?

1934
01:27:38,435 --> 01:27:40,377
You'll never know.

1935
