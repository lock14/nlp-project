1
00:01:28,638 --> 00:01:30,445
Wake up, God damn it!

2
00:01:31,915 --> 00:01:33,936
<i>I know it's hard.</i>

3
00:01:34,007 --> 00:01:38,178
<i>Your eyes is burning,
slowly opening.</i>

4
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:41,742
<i>You slowly realizing
that this wasn't no dream.</i>

5
00:01:41,815 --> 00:01:43,836
<i>No, this is your life.</i>

6
00:02:32,644 --> 00:02:37,101
Yeah, right about now you're looking
at them cold walls that surround you,

7
00:02:37,176 --> 00:02:40,694
<i>and you wondering, "How the hell
did I get up in this joint, Jack?</i>

8
00:02:40,766 --> 00:02:43,476
<i>"And how the fuck
I'm gonna get out?"</i>

9
00:03:05,449 --> 00:03:08,860
But you know what they say:
"It's like life, y'all.

10
00:03:08,935 --> 00:03:11,681
<i>"Ain't no way to it,
but to do it. "</i>

11
00:03:13,049 --> 00:03:17,090
<i>So reach on up there and scratch
another day off the wall, man.</i>

12
00:03:17,162 --> 00:03:19,075
<i>But don't be whining.</i>

13
00:03:19,149 --> 00:03:20,326
<i>Uh-uh.</i>

14
00:03:20,404 --> 00:03:22,876
<i>Ain't gonna be no signal fire.</i>

15
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:24,684
<i>Just take a stand.</i>

16
00:03:24,762 --> 00:03:26,497
<i>Be a man.
It's good to see you, man.</i>

17
00:03:26,575 --> 00:03:28,975
<i>And try to understand.
Hey, listen, man. Listen.</i>

18
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:31,106
<i>You ain't in here
'cause of the master's plan.</i>

19
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:33,578
<i>No, you in here
'cause you fucked up!</i>

20
00:03:35,429 --> 00:03:38,425
Look, this is the nigga that I've
been writing you about. You dig?

21
00:03:38,498 --> 00:03:41,803
Yo, I was reading my court
papers the other day, y'all.

22
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:47,525
They say, "Ralph Waldo 'Petey' Greene
versus the United States of America."

23
00:03:47,596 --> 00:03:51,209
I say, "Goddamn! No wonder
I'm up in this motherfucker!"

24
00:03:52,616 --> 00:03:55,992
So I'm gonna dedicate
this next one to my baby.

25
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:00,767
Man, she gonna be up here in a
minute, and this gal, Lord have mercy,

26
00:04:00,844 --> 00:04:02,722
she's fine as frogs, yeah.

27
00:04:02,796 --> 00:04:06,801
<i>So while this is playing, I want y'all
to think about the one y'all love.</i>

28
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:08,990
<i>And I'm talking about the one
sends you them pictures, man,</i>

29
00:04:09,071 --> 00:04:11,436
<i>not the cat in the next bunk.</i>

30
00:04:12,417 --> 00:04:15,092
I guess you're pretty hard up
for entertainment around here.

31
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:17,287
Yeah, man. This is prison.

32
00:04:17,403 --> 00:04:20,326
Whatever gets you through
twenty-to-life.

33
00:04:24,794 --> 00:04:26,494
I got a meeting.

34
00:04:27,792 --> 00:04:29,075
You...

35
00:04:32,394 --> 00:04:34,795
You need anything?
I don't need shit.

36
00:04:34,869 --> 00:04:36,045
Okay.

37
00:04:37,274 --> 00:04:40,234
Let me ask you something.
Why do you even bother?

38
00:04:40,307 --> 00:04:42,423
Because I promised Mama.

39
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:48,216
Don't do me no fucking favors.

40
00:05:13,704 --> 00:05:15,332
Hello, Vernell.

41
00:05:20,642 --> 00:05:22,627
That's the booty line.

42
00:05:23,605 --> 00:05:24,638
Conjugal visits.

43
00:05:35,145 --> 00:05:38,485
Hay. Hey, Radio man! Hey!

44
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:42,386
So Milo been telling you
about me, huh?

45
00:05:42,466 --> 00:05:43,642
What?

46
00:05:44,034 --> 00:05:46,185
Milo. Your brother?

47
00:05:46,266 --> 00:05:49,225
Said y'all need a new DJ
at that radio station.

48
00:05:49,647 --> 00:05:50,965
Hey, I'm your man.

49
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:53,026
My brother wouldn't know.

50
00:05:53,097 --> 00:05:56,402
And in case you forgot,
you're in prison.

51
00:05:56,688 --> 00:05:57,865
It's a minor challenge.

52
00:05:57,943 --> 00:05:59,571
You're a miscreant.

53
00:06:00,384 --> 00:06:02,749
That's more than
a minor challenge.

54
00:06:02,825 --> 00:06:04,881
The fuck this nigga call me?
A Miss who?

55
00:06:04,951 --> 00:06:06,483
A miscreant.

56
00:06:06,693 --> 00:06:08,120
A convict.

57
00:06:10,808 --> 00:06:14,113
Listen to this nigga!
I'm a miscreant!

58
00:06:14,189 --> 00:06:16,305
Well, you know what?
I like that shit!

59
00:06:16,385 --> 00:06:18,893
'Cause that makes me sound
like a con with class.

60
00:06:18,965 --> 00:06:21,781
Hey, Ralph Waldo
"Petey" Greene,

61
00:06:21,859 --> 00:06:23,559
miscreant mack
at your service.

62
00:06:23,637 --> 00:06:26,216
You forgot "felon."

63
00:06:26,496 --> 00:06:27,814
"Lowlife."

64
00:06:28,831 --> 00:06:31,541
So do that mean
I got a job or what?

65
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:34,128
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!

66
00:06:34,792 --> 00:06:37,371
I need you to do me a favor,
sugar. Okay?

67
00:06:37,442 --> 00:06:40,473
I need you to go home
and take this

68
00:06:40,544 --> 00:06:43,396
right on down to Nighthawk
for me, okay?

69
00:06:44,275 --> 00:06:45,451
Here.

70
00:06:46,297 --> 00:06:47,473
Here!

71
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,322
Come on, take it!

72
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:51,025
Here!

73
00:06:52,118 --> 00:06:53,746
Ain't no padding in there,
sweetie.

74
00:06:53,827 --> 00:06:56,049
You tell him
it's all me, okay?

75
00:06:56,127 --> 00:06:57,482
Vernell.

76
00:06:58,219 --> 00:07:00,512
What? You don't get
your ass in that room...

77
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:01,945
Oh, shut up.
It's just a bra.

78
00:07:02,019 --> 00:07:03,825
Hey, radio man!

79
00:07:03,902 --> 00:07:04,971
You better come on!

80
00:07:05,052 --> 00:07:06,858
I'm gonna look you up
when I get out of here, man.

81
00:07:06,935 --> 00:07:08,670
Yeah?
How many years you pulling?

82
00:07:08,747 --> 00:07:09,853
Five to ten.

83
00:07:09,933 --> 00:07:12,643
Nickel to a dime.
It ain't shit, baby.

84
00:07:12,722 --> 00:07:13,934
You do that.

85
00:07:14,011 --> 00:07:17,422
I'm the best there is, baby.
I'm the greatest!

86
00:07:17,498 --> 00:07:20,172
I'm the greatest
of all time, baby!

87
00:07:22,552 --> 00:07:24,882
<i>This is
The Nighthawk Show,</i>

88
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:29,594
doing it for all those fine young
things down at Howard University.

89
00:07:30,013 --> 00:07:33,353
The Love Hawk
with you all night,

90
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:36,425
rocking your radio
in the nation's capital.

91
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:42,106
It's 5:10 on the
Sounds of Soul, the big O-L.

92
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,818
We keep losing ground to WOOK.

93
00:07:45,561 --> 00:07:49,079
We can make up the lost ground on OK,
sir. I mean, we have a very exciting slate.

94
00:07:49,152 --> 00:07:51,482
Great music, talk... Sounds
good, but it's not working.

95
00:07:51,557 --> 00:07:53,114
What's the problem?

96
00:07:53,196 --> 00:07:55,348
The problem is we've lost
touch with the real DC

97
00:07:55,427 --> 00:07:58,137
in our attempts
to win over the Beltway.

98
00:07:58,216 --> 00:08:00,402
This has always been
a station of the people

99
00:08:00,482 --> 00:08:02,954
and in case you forgot, most of
the people don't live in Georgetown.

100
00:08:03,027 --> 00:08:04,727
Yeah, but the people who live
in Georgetown

101
00:08:04,805 --> 00:08:07,408
do shop at Giant Foods
and Woody's.

102
00:08:07,489 --> 00:08:08,951
Sponsors that pay your salary.

103
00:08:09,023 --> 00:08:12,541
No. I pay his salary,
and yours.

104
00:08:14,078 --> 00:08:17,275
Maybe I should start paying
your salary to him.

105
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:20,800
Sir, I think...
I'm serious.

106
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:23,210
What do you say, Dewey?

107
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:26,305
You think
you can turn us around?

108
00:08:26,837 --> 00:08:28,714
Yes sir, I do.
Good.

109
00:08:29,591 --> 00:08:31,433
Let's give it a try.

110
00:08:34,298 --> 00:08:35,759
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

111
00:08:35,832 --> 00:08:39,064
Sir, I just need
a minute of your time, please.

112
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:43,524
<i>Hey, y'all, guess what? I found
out today I ain't a con, y'all.</i>

113
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:44,961
<i>For real.</i>

114
00:08:45,383 --> 00:08:50,221
<i>I am not a con,
or a felon, or a thug.</i>

115
00:08:50,299 --> 00:08:53,675
<i>No. I am a miscreant.</i>

116
00:08:55,145 --> 00:08:56,808
<i>Now, y'all know what that is?
Good morning.</i>

117
00:08:56,887 --> 00:09:00,715
<i>That's a con, brother.
A felon, a thug.</i>

118
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:03,500
<i>We ain't in prison.</i>

119
00:09:03,581 --> 00:09:06,577
<i>No, this
a correctional facility.</i>

120
00:09:06,649 --> 00:09:10,512
<i>See, when you broke into
that car, or shot that nigga,</i>

121
00:09:10,589 --> 00:09:13,441
<i>it wasn't 'cause you a
wrong-doing motherfucker, no.</i>

122
00:09:13,795 --> 00:09:16,267
<i>No, see,
you troubled, brother.</i>

123
00:09:16,341 --> 00:09:18,361
<i>You disenfranchised.</i>

124
00:09:18,781 --> 00:09:23,132
<i>The Tonight Show Starring
Johnny Carson. And now...</i>

125
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:27,143
<i>All this wordplay so that we
don't have to face the truth.</i>

126
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:32,228
<i>'Cause the truth is, no matter
how many ways you try to slice it,</i>

127
00:09:33,144 --> 00:09:34,535
<i>I'm a con.</i>

128
00:09:36,595 --> 00:09:38,021
Lights out!

129
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:41,469
<i>And you a con, too.</i>

130
00:09:43,812 --> 00:09:49,101
<i>Warden's got a little dick!
Warden's got a little dick!</i>

131
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:51,782
Yeah! Come on, Warden!
What you got?

132
00:09:52,841 --> 00:09:53,874
You got that little dick?

133
00:09:53,957 --> 00:09:55,834
Who the hell is that man
on my tower?

134
00:09:55,908 --> 00:09:59,426
Braxton, Poochie, sir.
Ten-to-fifteen, armed robbery.

135
00:10:01,173 --> 00:10:05,833
Hey, Warden! You got a little, itty-bitty
dick! That's right! That's you, Warden!

136
00:10:05,913 --> 00:10:07,684
Shoot him.
Sir?

137
00:10:07,762 --> 00:10:09,639
Right between the eyes.

138
00:10:09,713 --> 00:10:12,388
I don't know
if we can do that, legally.

139
00:10:12,467 --> 00:10:15,427
Technically,
he's not trying to escape.

140
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,758
Well, where in hell can I
shoot him, then? Listen here!

141
00:10:17,837 --> 00:10:21,522
I want Petey Greene!

142
00:10:21,601 --> 00:10:23,622
You hear me, Warden?

143
00:10:23,693 --> 00:10:27,378
I want you to get Petey Greene
out here, right now.

144
00:10:28,783 --> 00:10:31,493
Petey! Petey! Petey!
Petey! Petey! Petey!

145
00:10:31,572 --> 00:10:33,414
What's he gonna do?

146
00:10:34,326 --> 00:10:35,502
Where Petey at?

147
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,838
Oh, yo, Petey!

148
00:10:40,357 --> 00:10:43,245
Yeah. Look,
you got a little dick!

149
00:10:43,774 --> 00:10:47,042
Warden! Your dick, Warden!

150
00:10:48,584 --> 00:10:51,187
Look like you got
quite a situation here, sir.

151
00:10:51,268 --> 00:10:53,253
Yes, Mr. Greene, I do.

152
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:57,361
<i>Warden's got
a little dick!</i>

153
00:10:57,439 --> 00:10:59,281
Can you do anything?

154
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:02,734
I don't know, sir.

155
00:11:02,808 --> 00:11:06,219
I mean, what you got
in your boxers is God's doing.

156
00:11:08,386 --> 00:11:11,868
Sorry, Warden, you kind of
walked right into that one.

157
00:11:11,942 --> 00:11:15,246
Poochie! Nigga, what the hell
are you doing up there, man?

158
00:11:16,787 --> 00:11:19,330
Yeah! Warden's got
a little dick!

159
00:11:19,402 --> 00:11:21,588
Now look here, Warden.
Poochie crazy.

160
00:11:21,668 --> 00:11:24,175
He's a good kid, but he got
all fucked up on that narcotic.

161
00:11:24,247 --> 00:11:26,755
Come on, Warden, what you
got? I can get him down.

162
00:11:26,827 --> 00:11:28,598
Got that little dick!
I can even shut him up.

163
00:11:28,675 --> 00:11:30,446
Come on, what you gonna do?

164
00:11:30,522 --> 00:11:33,827
What you gonna do, Warden?
I'd be very grateful.

165
00:11:39,762 --> 00:11:43,030
Now, exactly how grateful
are we talking about?

166
00:11:54,368 --> 00:11:55,830
All right.

167
00:11:57,087 --> 00:11:58,264
Poochie!

168
00:11:58,342 --> 00:12:00,980
Petey! It's Petey!

169
00:12:01,062 --> 00:12:03,640
Boy, if you don't come down from
there and stop making all that noise,

170
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:04,994
I'm gonna call your mama.

171
00:12:05,071 --> 00:12:07,888
I'm gonna tell her you
out here acting a fool, man.

172
00:12:07,964 --> 00:12:09,247
Now, come on down. Poochie.

173
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,293
Petey! Petey!
Petey! Petey!

174
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:24,024
Petey! Petey! Petey! Petey!

175
00:12:35,748 --> 00:12:40,408
<i>We take all necessary measures
in support of freedom</i>

176
00:12:41,292 --> 00:12:43,479
<i>and in defense of peace
in Southeast Asia.</i>

177
00:12:43,558 --> 00:12:46,898
<i>Stop the bombing,
and stop the war.</i>

178
00:12:53,598 --> 00:12:54,916
Come on.

179
00:13:04,544 --> 00:13:06,422
Petey!

180
00:13:06,497 --> 00:13:07,852
Yeah.

181
00:13:10,227 --> 00:13:11,759
Ain't this a bitch?

182
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:13,007
What?

183
00:13:14,271 --> 00:13:15,863
I can't move my legs, baby.

184
00:13:15,944 --> 00:13:17,441
You jiving!

185
00:13:17,513 --> 00:13:18,619
No.

186
00:13:19,395 --> 00:13:21,058
Look here, Petey.

187
00:13:21,139 --> 00:13:24,300
Now, you know I been
with you ten years, right?

188
00:13:24,381 --> 00:13:26,567
Hell, nine of them
you was in jail.

189
00:13:26,647 --> 00:13:28,763
So you know how
I feel about you.

190
00:13:28,843 --> 00:13:31,315
But I didn't get all foxy,
nails done, new dress

191
00:13:31,388 --> 00:13:34,063
to hear you talking
about you can't move.

192
00:13:34,142 --> 00:13:36,293
Now, I know you're scared.
Okay?

193
00:13:36,373 --> 00:13:38,358
Every man is scared.

194
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:42,043
But baby, I'm standing here in a
girdle and some tight-ass shoes,

195
00:13:42,126 --> 00:13:43,896
and I wanna meet me
some Nighthawk!

196
00:13:43,973 --> 00:13:48,465
So you best to get your legs to moving
and get in there and get your job.

197
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,752
What if I ain't good enough?

198
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:53,098
Hell! Every man I know
ain't good enough, Petey!

199
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:58,475
But even with all your shit,
you the only one who is.

200
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:01,917
Now, come on! Look at you!

201
00:14:01,997 --> 00:14:03,529
You the man with the pants!

202
00:14:03,599 --> 00:14:04,669
Yeah.

203
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:08,684
The shit-talking,
pimp-walking, good-Ioving man.

204
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,830
Oh, that's right.

205
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:13,012
The mack that's the head of
the Cool Cat Clan! Give me some!

206
00:14:13,082 --> 00:14:14,187
Preach on.

207
00:14:14,268 --> 00:14:18,868
And you'll be damned if you take shit
from any black, yellow, green or white man.

208
00:14:18,939 --> 00:14:20,639
Amen!
Hallelujah!

209
00:14:22,983 --> 00:14:25,003
Baby, did I tell you
how good you look?

210
00:14:25,074 --> 00:14:26,500
I know!

211
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,293
Good afternoon, good people.

212
00:14:34,312 --> 00:14:37,759
There he is.
You wanted to meet him, go on.

213
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:39,746
I can't move my legs.

214
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,555
Hello, DC, this is Sunny Jim,
coming back at you.

215
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,891
Well, it's about time
for me to go,

216
00:14:46,968 --> 00:14:49,190
but don't forget to come
to the country fair tomorrow.

217
00:14:49,269 --> 00:14:52,466
I know I'd love me some cotton
candy. How about you, Widget?

218
00:14:53,661 --> 00:14:55,848
"Oh yeah, I love it, I love
it. It's sweet, it's fluffy,

219
00:14:55,927 --> 00:14:59,232
"and it's oh-so-satisfying!"

220
00:14:59,448 --> 00:15:03,489
I'm gonna leave you with the
sunny, sweet, cotton-candy sounds

221
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:05,473
of The Supremes.

222
00:15:21,306 --> 00:15:23,220
Have no fear,
The Hawk is here.

223
00:15:23,294 --> 00:15:24,921
You're late.

224
00:15:25,002 --> 00:15:27,640
Oh, I'm never late. The Hawk
is always right on time.

225
00:15:27,721 --> 00:15:29,313
Just hurry on up
and get in there.

226
00:15:29,394 --> 00:15:31,130
What you got?

227
00:15:31,207 --> 00:15:33,287
Better tell these women
to stop calling here for you.

228
00:15:33,369 --> 00:15:35,591
I'm not your social secretary.

229
00:15:35,669 --> 00:15:37,547
Jamming up my phones!

230
00:15:37,621 --> 00:15:39,642
One heifer sent her panties!

231
00:15:39,713 --> 00:15:41,935
Don't blame me.
It's the voice.

232
00:15:42,537 --> 00:15:45,877
In the last six months, we've seen our
numbers rise with our core audience.

233
00:15:45,953 --> 00:15:48,319
Nighthawk's show, as you can
see, is winning in its time slot.

234
00:15:48,394 --> 00:15:51,317
But we need to take another
serious look at our programming.

235
00:15:51,392 --> 00:15:55,634
We need to inject some new
ideas, some new blood, some...

236
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,820
Oh, hell, no.

237
00:15:59,898 --> 00:16:01,776
You all right, Dewey?

238
00:16:03,767 --> 00:16:07,214
Yes, sir.
Anyway, the morning show...

239
00:16:08,753 --> 00:16:10,524
May I help you?
Yeah, sweetness.

240
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,072
Tell your boss that Petey
Greene's on the scene.

241
00:16:13,145 --> 00:16:15,891
May I ask
what this is pertaining to?

242
00:16:16,736 --> 00:16:20,290
I don't know what it's pertaining.
Just tell him it's about my job.

243
00:16:20,362 --> 00:16:22,347
Go on, get on the horn, sugar.

244
00:16:22,418 --> 00:16:23,594
<i>This is the Nighthawk,</i>

245
00:16:24,824 --> 00:16:27,641
<i>Taking you all the way to the
midnight hour. That's my song!</i>

246
00:16:29,112 --> 00:16:32,559
<i>Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry to interrupt
you, but there's a Petey Greene</i>

247
00:16:32,633 --> 00:16:35,271
<i>who wants to tell you he's
"on the scene."</i>

248
00:16:36,224 --> 00:16:38,767
Come on with your bad self! Sir?

249
00:16:41,174 --> 00:16:43,397
...a five-dollar bill
right there.

250
00:16:43,475 --> 00:16:46,398
What in blue blazes
is going on out here?

251
00:16:47,135 --> 00:16:49,713
Did this nigga just say
"blue blazes"? He did!

252
00:16:49,784 --> 00:16:50,818
Who are these people?

253
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:53,408
Hold it, now. Hold it, man. We
got an appointment, all right?

254
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,871
Go on, get your boss, sugar.

255
00:16:54,945 --> 00:16:56,442
That is my boss.

256
00:16:56,513 --> 00:16:59,853
No, not Blue Blazes. I'm talking
about the skinny, righteous nigga.

257
00:16:59,929 --> 00:17:03,971
Young man, there is one boss here,
I am he, and we don't use that term.

258
00:17:04,043 --> 00:17:06,099
Hey!
Well, right the fuck on, man!

259
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:09,723
Where you been hiding? Come on,
tell your boss here about my job.

260
00:17:09,796 --> 00:17:11,328
What?
What?

261
00:17:12,445 --> 00:17:14,466
Tell your boss that
I'm your new DJ, man.

262
00:17:14,537 --> 00:17:15,999
Did you promise
this fellow a job?

263
00:17:16,071 --> 00:17:17,663
No sir.
I didn't promise him anything.

264
00:17:17,743 --> 00:17:19,336
Now, you is about
a lying motherfucker.

265
00:17:19,417 --> 00:17:22,198
You promised me a job as
soon as I got out the joint.

266
00:17:22,276 --> 00:17:24,606
Well surprise, I'm out.
You owe me.

267
00:17:24,681 --> 00:17:26,761
Oh my God, he's a convict.

268
00:17:26,842 --> 00:17:28,233
Ex-convict!

269
00:17:28,306 --> 00:17:30,184
I prefer "miscreant."

270
00:17:30,259 --> 00:17:31,650
Freda, call the police.

271
00:17:31,723 --> 00:17:34,849
Now, you ain't calling
a motherfucker!

272
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:38,032
You know how much bullshit I
had to run to get out of jail?

273
00:17:38,102 --> 00:17:40,432
I ain't never going
back there, man.

274
00:17:40,508 --> 00:17:44,300
Now, you promised me a job, and I'm
here to work in this funky joint.

275
00:17:44,377 --> 00:17:46,920
And ain't no way
in blue blazes I'm leaving

276
00:17:46,993 --> 00:17:48,799
till I get what's mine.
Right on!

277
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:50,468
So figure it out.
That's right.

278
00:17:50,548 --> 00:17:53,650
Sir, would you excuse
us for one moment please?

279
00:17:54,104 --> 00:17:55,495
Would you like
to come with me?

280
00:17:55,568 --> 00:17:57,232
Yeah. Talk to me. Shit.

281
00:17:59,089 --> 00:18:00,753
This is my song!

282
00:18:01,983 --> 00:18:04,064
Girl, you can't feel that?

283
00:18:05,225 --> 00:18:06,473
What y'all trying
to do to me and shit?

284
00:18:07,492 --> 00:18:09,928
Get your goddamn hands off of
me! Have you lost your mind?

285
00:18:10,001 --> 00:18:11,737
Are you trying
to get me fired?

286
00:18:11,814 --> 00:18:13,477
Man, I'm trying
to get me a job!

287
00:18:13,557 --> 00:18:15,363
Look, I admire
your determination, okay?

288
00:18:15,439 --> 00:18:18,744
But you do not walk in here and talk
to Mr. E.G. Sonderling like that!

289
00:18:18,821 --> 00:18:21,044
And where the hell did you get
the idea you'd be a disc jockey?

290
00:18:21,122 --> 00:18:23,035
From you, brother.
What?

291
00:18:23,109 --> 00:18:26,592
I never said that.
I said, "Look me up." Okay?

292
00:18:26,665 --> 00:18:29,481
And even if I could get you a
job, it would be as a janitor,

293
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:30,985
or a window cleaner, maybe.

294
00:18:31,057 --> 00:18:32,614
Oh, I don't do windows,
Jack.

295
00:18:32,696 --> 00:18:36,631
I guess that kind of work is beneath
a convict of your pedigree, huh?

296
00:18:36,705 --> 00:18:39,308
You know what, man? Fuck you.

297
00:18:39,389 --> 00:18:40,780
I thought you was real.

298
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:43,813
You ain't nothing but another
white boy with a tan.

299
00:18:43,886 --> 00:18:47,368
See, a cat come out of Hard Time,
U.S.A. Looking to turn his life around...

300
00:18:47,443 --> 00:18:49,736
Shit, I expect
to get rejected by whitey!

301
00:18:49,813 --> 00:18:51,311
So because I'm black,

302
00:18:51,382 --> 00:18:54,722
I'm supposed to ignore the fact that
your only experience has been in jail

303
00:18:54,798 --> 00:18:56,498
and hire you as a DJ?

304
00:18:56,576 --> 00:18:58,383
You goddamn right.

305
00:18:59,365 --> 00:19:01,028
You sound
just like my brother.

306
00:19:01,109 --> 00:19:03,652
Nigga, I ain't him. I'm out
here trying to get what's mine.

307
00:19:03,723 --> 00:19:07,205
His ass is back there
in Lorton, cooling his heels.

308
00:19:07,488 --> 00:19:09,021
But you know what?
That's all right.

309
00:19:09,091 --> 00:19:11,943
You Sidney Poitier-ass nigga,
I'm gonna get what's mine.

310
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:16,335
And when I do, I'm coming right back
here and shove it in your fucking face!

311
00:19:16,412 --> 00:19:17,909
Sellout!

312
00:19:22,897 --> 00:19:25,820
Vernell. Come on, baby, we're
splitting. All right, baby.

313
00:19:25,894 --> 00:19:28,676
Come on. All right! Oh,
wait, wait, wait, wait!

314
00:19:28,753 --> 00:19:32,794
One second. Wait. I'll be right
back! Wait for me, okay, sugar?

315
00:19:45,627 --> 00:19:46,803
That Formica?

316
00:19:51,727 --> 00:19:54,794
Hey, you're...
No, you can't go in there.

317
00:20:06,229 --> 00:20:08,522
You make me so hot.

318
00:20:13,272 --> 00:20:15,114
Bye-bye! Thank you!

319
00:20:22,615 --> 00:20:25,087
It was so lovely meeting all
of y'all. Bring your ass on!

320
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,798
Shut the fuck up!
I'm coming, God damn it!

321
00:20:27,878 --> 00:20:29,827
Blue Blazes, you so cute!

322
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,931
I'm gonna take this off your
hands, girl. Power to the people!

323
00:20:36,978 --> 00:20:39,937
Vernell!
Shut up! Shit!

324
00:20:41,195 --> 00:20:45,023
I told your ass I was coming
up here to see the Nighthawk!

325
00:21:03,925 --> 00:21:06,218
Thanks.
You're welcome, brother.

326
00:21:19,369 --> 00:21:20,581
Hello, brother.

327
00:21:24,424 --> 00:21:26,159
Democratic freedom, brother.

328
00:21:26,237 --> 00:21:28,079
First Amendment, baby.

329
00:21:28,154 --> 00:21:29,782
God bless you.

<i>Now, I ask you,
is that righteousness?</i>

361
00:22:55,762 --> 00:22:57,117
No!

362
00:22:57,191 --> 00:23:01,886
Ladies and gentlemen, WOL would
never turn its back on our listeners.

363
00:23:01,967 --> 00:23:06,733
Our goal is to speak for and to unite
the community, not divide or hurt.

364
00:23:06,813 --> 00:23:09,451
<i>Did he say WOL speaks
for the community?</i>

365
00:23:09,531 --> 00:23:11,718
<i>Why ain't they speaking
about that black boy</i>

366
00:23:11,797 --> 00:23:14,127
<i>that got shot down
by them pigs the other day?</i>

367
00:23:14,203 --> 00:23:17,127
Yeah!
Yeah!

368
00:23:17,201 --> 00:23:20,232
<i>Do you know why?
'Cause if they did,</i>

369
00:23:20,304 --> 00:23:23,822
<i>Mr. Giant Foods may not give
them any more of that green stuff.</i>

370
00:23:23,894 --> 00:23:28,589
<i>And as we know, money is
always the real truth!</i>

371
00:23:29,681 --> 00:23:32,783
Petey! Petey!
Petey! Petey!

372
00:23:32,854 --> 00:23:39,680
Petey! Petey! Petey! Petey!

00:23:39,756 --> 00:23:42,086
<i>Hell, no!

375
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:47,211
<i>Let him know!
Petey! Petey! Petey! Petey!</i>

376
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:09,422
You're late.

377
00:24:09,493 --> 00:24:11,965
Hey, you a little out of your
element around here, ain't you,

378
00:24:12,038 --> 00:24:13,702
Mister Tibbs?

379
00:24:15,803 --> 00:24:20,676
Well, I thought you might be more
comfortable in familiar surroundings.

380
00:24:21,347 --> 00:24:22,523
Yeah, you right.

381
00:24:22,601 --> 00:24:25,525
So, I wanna bring this little
show of yours to an end.

382
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:27,964
Well, that mean you
offering me a job? No.

383
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:31,035
Well, then I'm afraid
the show must go on.

384
00:24:31,491 --> 00:24:33,606
That's entertainment talk.

385
00:24:34,349 --> 00:24:36,715
Listen, man,
since you're here,

386
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:42,322
wanna play a little game?
A little 9-Ball?

387
00:24:43,762 --> 00:24:45,009
Sure.

388
00:24:47,144 --> 00:24:48,701
Call it, sugar.

389
00:24:49,201 --> 00:24:51,078
Heads. Please.

390
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:55,576
Tails.
Rack 'em, chump.

391
00:24:55,651 --> 00:24:56,684
Please.

392
00:25:02,309 --> 00:25:04,852
Wanna make it
a little interesting?

393
00:25:04,923 --> 00:25:07,253
A little wager on it,
radio man?

394
00:25:07,364 --> 00:25:08,682
You don't wanna just play?

395
00:25:08,758 --> 00:25:12,443
Ain't really playing unless
you got something on the line.

396
00:25:14,476 --> 00:25:16,211
What do you think? About

397
00:25:16,951 --> 00:25:18,543
five hundred?

398
00:25:19,774 --> 00:25:22,412
Rolling kind of heavy for
a man just out of the joint.

399
00:25:22,494 --> 00:25:25,096
Oh, they got
a real nice savings plan.

400
00:25:26,432 --> 00:25:27,644
Okay.

401
00:25:29,048 --> 00:25:30,675
Uh-huh.

402
00:25:30,756 --> 00:25:33,334
I see Mr. Blue Blazes
keeps you happy.

403
00:25:33,405 --> 00:25:34,867
I do okay.

404
00:25:37,414 --> 00:25:40,017
Now, this is just a side bet,
you understand.

405
00:25:40,098 --> 00:25:41,275
Really?

406
00:25:41,353 --> 00:25:42,910
What you say, Tibbs?

407
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:47,408
How about you play me
for a career?

408
00:25:47,907 --> 00:25:49,678
One game, 9-Ball.

409
00:25:50,452 --> 00:25:53,554
I win, you get me
a job down at that station.

410
00:25:54,182 --> 00:25:56,821
And as you know,
I don't do windows.

411
00:26:01,364 --> 00:26:03,064
And if you lose?

412
00:26:07,429 --> 00:26:09,616
I leave you the fuck alone.

413
00:26:11,927 --> 00:26:13,912
Well, then, let's play.

414
00:26:14,681 --> 00:26:16,417
Well, all right.

415
00:26:16,494 --> 00:26:19,311
I tell you what.
Here's another hundred

416
00:26:19,596 --> 00:26:22,271
says you don't drop
a ball off the break.

417
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:27,366
Mister Tibbs,
trying to talk a little shit!

418
00:26:29,253 --> 00:26:31,369
I like your style, Tibbs!

419
00:26:33,019 --> 00:26:36,085
Yeah, I'm gonna take some more
of your money.

420
00:26:36,156 --> 00:26:37,582
Get him!

421
00:26:38,317 --> 00:26:40,539
I'm about to run this rack.

422
00:26:41,699 --> 00:26:45,562
You're chalking up your cue a
little heavy there, ain't you?

423
00:26:45,638 --> 00:26:48,978
I mean, that ain't your
cellmate's dick you're holding.

424
00:26:52,401 --> 00:26:54,481
Just for that, I'm gonna drop
the nine ball off the break.

425
00:26:54,563 --> 00:26:57,522
Nigga, you couldn't drop your
drawers to fuck The Supremes

426
00:26:57,596 --> 00:27:01,316
if all three of them was lying
butt-naked on this table.

427
00:27:11,784 --> 00:27:13,697
What's the matter, big time?

428
00:27:13,771 --> 00:27:17,039
You thinking about all that
money lying in your lady's lap?

429
00:27:17,118 --> 00:27:19,269
Is that why you're sweating?

430
00:27:19,593 --> 00:27:22,861
Or maybe it's all that whiskey
you've been sucking on.

431
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:27,992
Or maybe you're sweating 'cause you know
that even if you give it your best shot,

432
00:27:28,553 --> 00:27:31,263
you still might
leave 'em standing.

433
00:27:31,934 --> 00:27:35,797
'Cause this ain't Lorton
anymore. This is the real world.

434
00:27:38,697 --> 00:27:40,955
And you ain't shit out here.

435
00:27:42,916 --> 00:27:44,579
Are you through?

436
00:27:45,356 --> 00:27:47,269
Knock 'em down, champ.

437
00:27:54,734 --> 00:27:57,099
All right. Come on. Come on. Baby.

438
00:27:57,174 --> 00:27:59,087
Yeah.
There it go!

439
00:28:00,312 --> 00:28:01,738
Damn!

440
00:28:03,728 --> 00:28:05,464
Too bad, big time.

441
00:28:07,075 --> 00:28:08,952
I had faith in you.

442
00:28:14,396 --> 00:28:17,106
One ball, corner.

443
00:28:21,717 --> 00:28:24,677
Two ball, side pocket.

444
00:28:28,305 --> 00:28:30,813
Three ball, corner.

445
00:28:33,291 --> 00:28:35,371
See, negroes always think that
if you speak correct English,

446
00:28:35,452 --> 00:28:38,090
or you wear clothes
other than clown suits,

447
00:28:38,171 --> 00:28:39,205
that you're not real.

448
00:28:39,462 --> 00:28:41,684
Four ball, side pocket.

449
00:28:44,237 --> 00:28:47,542
And to you, what's real is
a nigga loud-mouthing, right?

450
00:28:47,618 --> 00:28:52,385
Telling everybody how bad he is
while he's looking for a handout.

451
00:28:52,743 --> 00:28:53,955
Five.

452
00:28:56,055 --> 00:28:58,943
But you give him a chance
to take what's his,

453
00:28:59,716 --> 00:29:02,295
and he can't sink
one single ball.

454
00:29:02,505 --> 00:29:03,538
Six.

455
00:29:09,617 --> 00:29:11,078
Lucky seven!

456
00:29:14,148 --> 00:29:15,811
Now, you were so busy
running your mouth,

457
00:29:15,892 --> 00:29:20,028
you never really asked yourself
why I chose a pool hall to meet.

458
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:24,496
'Cause this uppity nigga could never
have grown up in these projects,

459
00:29:25,409 --> 00:29:27,322
or made his way through school

460
00:29:27,396 --> 00:29:30,878
hustling dumbass niggas
who thought he wasn't down.

461
00:29:38,551 --> 00:29:42,272
They call me Mr. Hughes.

462
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:54,192
Grew up
in the Anacostia projects.

463
00:30:01,805 --> 00:30:04,657
This con climbed the tower
in the yard back in Lorton.

464
00:30:04,732 --> 00:30:06,848
He up there, man,
he's talking real...

465
00:30:06,928 --> 00:30:09,365
You know, unflattering
about the warden's dick.

466
00:30:09,439 --> 00:30:11,519
Nobody could talk
this cat down.

467
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:13,062
So they call Petey Greene,
man,

468
00:30:13,134 --> 00:30:15,606
I talked this cat down
in five minutes, man.

469
00:30:16,341 --> 00:30:18,919
Let's just say the warden was
very, very grateful.

470
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:20,583
Five minutes, huh?
Mmm-hmm.

471
00:30:21,292 --> 00:30:23,028
But what the warden don't know

472
00:30:23,105 --> 00:30:28,014
is it took me six months to talk that
crazy nigga up there in the first place!

473
00:30:34,086 --> 00:30:36,201
Let me ask you something.

474
00:30:38,026 --> 00:30:39,487
Why?

475
00:30:39,943 --> 00:30:44,150
Why you want to be on the radio so bad
that you're gonna go through all this?

476
00:30:44,231 --> 00:30:48,129
Oh, man, it's what I do, man.
It's my thing, you know?

477
00:30:48,205 --> 00:30:51,795
I started off making them daily
announcements back at Lorton

478
00:30:51,865 --> 00:30:55,906
as part of the work program, you
know? A reward for good behavior.

479
00:30:56,536 --> 00:30:59,044
Couple years later, I convinced
them to let me play this record

480
00:30:59,116 --> 00:31:02,669
<i>that my Aunt Pig had sent me, a Sam
Cooke record, man, A Change Is Gonna Come.</i>

481
00:31:03,509 --> 00:31:04,686
That's an incredible song.

482
00:31:04,764 --> 00:31:08,901
She sent me that record, you know,
to try and give me a little hope,

483
00:31:08,982 --> 00:31:10,895
and I wanted to play it
for the men in them cells,

484
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:12,847
you know, give them some hope.

485
00:31:12,922 --> 00:31:15,038
And I'm telling you, man,

486
00:31:15,257 --> 00:31:20,202
it's the only thing that kept me from
going stone-crazy behind them walls, man.

487
00:31:20,695 --> 00:31:23,061
And now that I'm out,
I still need that.

488
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:26,059
Why should I put my ass on the
line to give you a shot, Petey?

489
00:31:26,135 --> 00:31:29,439
Nigga... 'Cause Petey Greene
is the real deal, Jack!

490
00:31:29,516 --> 00:31:34,841
Shit! I swear to God, I mean, he
is the sho'nuff, I mean, pimp...

491
00:31:36,767 --> 00:31:38,430
Sorry.
It's okay.

492
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:41,778
See, what this pretty lady
is trying to tell you is that,

493
00:31:41,857 --> 00:31:44,258
man, being a DJ, that's
the only thing I'm good at

494
00:31:44,332 --> 00:31:47,007
that don't involve me
breaking no law.

495
00:31:48,097 --> 00:31:51,366
And shit, since you here
sharing a drink,

496
00:31:51,444 --> 00:31:55,450
I'm gonna assume that you need
a man of my particular talents.

497
00:31:57,928 --> 00:31:59,520
Three rules.

498
00:32:00,682 --> 00:32:01,930
One,

499
00:32:02,565 --> 00:32:05,037
always know
more than your audience.

500
00:32:05,109 --> 00:32:07,890
Two, you talk shit,
you back it up.

501
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:10,049
And three, don't you ever,

502
00:32:11,245 --> 00:32:12,457
never, ever,

503
00:32:12,535 --> 00:32:14,520
underestimate me again.

504
00:32:15,115 --> 00:32:16,815
What are you talking about,
man?

505
00:32:16,892 --> 00:32:20,862
I'm gonna give you one more
chance to knock in that nine ball.

506
00:32:20,937 --> 00:32:25,809
Tomorrow morning, 9:00 a.m.,
WOL, Studio One. Be on time.

507
00:32:27,561 --> 00:32:28,951
Be sober.

508
00:32:29,721 --> 00:32:31,004
And definitely

509
00:32:32,545 --> 00:32:34,173
be by yourself.

510
00:32:35,474 --> 00:32:37,946
You my kind of nigga, Hughes!

511
00:32:38,019 --> 00:32:39,790
You my kind of motherfucker,
Hughes!

512
00:32:39,866 --> 00:32:42,541
We love you!
We love you!

513
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:44,047
Oh my God!

514
00:32:47,013 --> 00:32:49,235
We need to make
a personnel change.

515
00:32:49,313 --> 00:32:51,120
Really? Who?

516
00:32:51,196 --> 00:32:52,622
Sunny Jim.

517
00:32:53,428 --> 00:32:54,783
You're not serious.

518
00:32:54,857 --> 00:32:58,233
Sir, morning shows are becoming
more than just a leisurely stroll.

519
00:32:58,308 --> 00:32:59,627
We have to compete here.

520
00:32:59,703 --> 00:33:01,651
WOOK is killing us
in the morning.

521
00:33:01,725 --> 00:33:04,612
But Sunny Jim is a DC icon!

522
00:33:04,688 --> 00:33:08,063
Everyone loves Sunny Jim.
He's so sunny.

523
00:33:08,139 --> 00:33:09,565
No sir, you love Sunny Jim.

524
00:33:09,638 --> 00:33:12,561
Sunny Jim is a relic
of a bygone radio age.

525
00:33:12,636 --> 00:33:14,717
We don't play Nat "King" Cole
or The Drifters anymore.

526
00:33:14,797 --> 00:33:16,389
And our DJ's have
to reflect that.

527
00:33:16,471 --> 00:33:19,181
That's why we have Nighthawk
and Soul Papa.

528
00:33:19,259 --> 00:33:22,706
<i>I'm not turning this into some kind
of teenybopper American Bandstand.</i>

529
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:24,622
We're a respectable
R&B station.

530
00:33:24,699 --> 00:33:28,289
With all due respect, sir,
this is not a respectable town.

531
00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:29,856
This is DC.

532
00:33:29,928 --> 00:33:31,354
You see them out
on the mall every day,

533
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:34,005
protesting the so-called
respectable establishment.

534
00:33:34,076 --> 00:33:37,832
We can't become the establishment,
or they'll turn on us.

535
00:33:45,197 --> 00:33:46,409
Who do you have in mind?

536
00:33:46,487 --> 00:33:49,162
Well, sir, I found a DJ
from an out-of-town station.

537
00:33:49,241 --> 00:33:51,642
He has a major following,

538
00:33:51,716 --> 00:33:55,437
<i>and he's recently
been released</i>

539
00:33:55,516 --> 00:33:57,287
<i>from his contract.</i>

540
00:34:02,697 --> 00:34:06,073
Jim, come back here, please.
It's nothing personal.

541
00:34:07,334 --> 00:34:09,592
Oh, shit! I'm sorry...

542
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:11,370
Watch where the hell
you're going!

543
00:34:11,447 --> 00:34:12,980
All right, man.

544
00:34:14,027 --> 00:34:16,249
Oh, no.
Hey, sugar!

545
00:34:16,329 --> 00:34:18,515
You know the drill.
Call your man.

546
00:34:18,594 --> 00:34:20,020
I don't think so.

547
00:34:20,093 --> 00:34:21,590
Let me ask you something.

548
00:34:21,662 --> 00:34:23,433
You ever had anybody
eat your pussy?

549
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:24,793
Mr. Sonderling!

550
00:34:27,275 --> 00:34:29,152
What's wrong, Freda?

551
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:32,355
Oh, God. Blue Blazes.
How the radio business?

552
00:34:32,434 --> 00:34:34,312
I put up with your
shenanigans out front

553
00:34:34,387 --> 00:34:36,122
for a week, Mr. Brown.
Greene.

554
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,280
All right, Mr. Green,
what do you want now?

555
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,988
I'm your DJ, man!

556
00:34:40,069 --> 00:34:41,530
Freda, call the police.

557
00:34:41,602 --> 00:34:45,608
God damn! Y'all got some hospitality
issues around this motherfucker!

558
00:34:45,681 --> 00:34:47,630
You're cutting it close.

559
00:34:47,704 --> 00:34:50,699
What can I say, man?
Had to get my vine together.

560
00:34:50,772 --> 00:34:52,198
Your vine?
Yeah.

561
00:34:52,271 --> 00:34:53,661
You're going on the...

562
00:34:53,735 --> 00:34:54,768
Fuck.

563
00:34:55,268 --> 00:34:56,896
Mr. Sonderling,

564
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:00,804
this is our new morning DJ.

565
00:35:07,122 --> 00:35:08,369
I've been hoodwinked!

566
00:35:09,597 --> 00:35:10,667
Come on.

567
00:35:10,747 --> 00:35:15,347
You are out of your mind if you think
I'm gonna put this person on the air.

568
00:35:15,418 --> 00:35:16,701
Sir, I know
this is unorthodox...

569
00:35:16,778 --> 00:35:18,370
Unorthodox? It's insane!

570
00:35:18,451 --> 00:35:20,400
Sir, hear me out.
This man has a unique voice.

571
00:35:20,473 --> 00:35:22,803
I just have a feeling... I have
much more than just a feeling.

572
00:35:22,879 --> 00:35:25,803
Sir, we need to put somebody on the air
in the next two minutes or we go black.

573
00:35:25,877 --> 00:35:28,099
Black, black, black.

574
00:35:31,594 --> 00:35:33,995
Freda, run after Jim, he might
still be in the building!

575
00:35:34,069 --> 00:35:35,495
Sir, we don't have time.

576
00:35:35,568 --> 00:35:38,492
You're just gonna have
to trust me. One show.

577
00:35:39,438 --> 00:35:40,829
One shot.

578
00:35:43,482 --> 00:35:45,812
Our morning show's already
in the toilet.

579
00:35:45,888 --> 00:35:48,491
We don't have a thing to lose.
You don't have a thing to lose!

580
00:35:48,572 --> 00:35:51,603
<i>Sir, it's one minute to air,
and Jim's gone.</i>

581
00:35:51,674 --> 00:35:53,754
Oh, for crying out loud.

582
00:35:54,359 --> 00:35:57,211
It's my own fault
for listening to you.

583
00:36:00,181 --> 00:36:02,783
All right, one show, one shot.

584
00:36:02,865 --> 00:36:05,230
I want you on air with him.
You can introduce him.

585
00:36:05,306 --> 00:36:07,563
I'll be watching and listening
to every word, young man.

586
00:36:07,641 --> 00:36:09,899
You watch your language
on the air. Scout's honor.

587
00:36:09,977 --> 00:36:11,189
Okay.

588
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:13,145
Let's go.

589
00:36:17,611 --> 00:36:18,966
You ready?
Yeah.

590
00:36:19,041 --> 00:36:24,687
Okay, remember, always talk, no dead
air. Talk about your cat, your car,

591
00:36:24,758 --> 00:36:26,873
anything, but no dead space.

592
00:36:26,955 --> 00:36:28,060
And watch your language.

593
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:32,632
Okay. Now, you're a man of Washington,
so speak to Washington, okay?

594
00:36:32,707 --> 00:36:34,787
Connect to Washington. Okay?

595
00:36:34,868 --> 00:36:36,009
Yeah.

596
00:36:36,089 --> 00:36:38,074
You watch your language.
This is it, Ralphie.

597
00:36:38,145 --> 00:36:39,737
Okay.
Okay.

598
00:36:40,166 --> 00:36:41,794
We're coming in.
Okay.

599
00:36:41,875 --> 00:36:43,717
Let's do it.
Okay.

600
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:46,368
Michael, get the door.

601
00:36:47,802 --> 00:36:53,483
Okay, we're on in five,
four, three, two, one...

602
00:36:54,739 --> 00:37:00,242
And hello, Washington. Welcome
to your new Sound of Soul, WOL.

603
00:37:00,561 --> 00:37:03,139
I'm Dewey Hughes,
director of programming,

604
00:37:03,211 --> 00:37:07,073
here to announce that Sunny Jim can
now be heard at the midnight hour,

605
00:37:07,149 --> 00:37:09,135
<i>after The Nighthawk Show.</i>

606
00:37:09,207 --> 00:37:12,820
Today I introduce to you
a new voice on the DC scene,

607
00:37:12,902 --> 00:37:17,145
a native of Washington, a true
son of the city, and some may say,

608
00:37:17,224 --> 00:37:23,430
a prophet of the streets, here to spin
the tunes that will blow your mind,

609
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:26,566
Mr. Petey Greene.

610
00:37:32,948 --> 00:37:34,374
Say hello, Petey.

611
00:37:34,446 --> 00:37:36,181
Yeah, hello.

612
00:37:38,595 --> 00:37:41,305
Like the man say,
this is Petey Greene.

613
00:37:41,383 --> 00:37:44,973
And I'm here to spin the tunes
to get you through your morning.

614
00:37:46,787 --> 00:37:48,867
Your AM morning drive.

615
00:37:52,819 --> 00:37:56,432
But hell, maybe you ain't
driving. Maybe you're walking.

616
00:37:56,513 --> 00:38:00,269
Maybe... Maybe you at work
already, maybe riding a bike.

617
00:38:00,732 --> 00:38:02,954
But irregardless,

618
00:38:05,403 --> 00:38:08,149
I'm gonna play the music

619
00:38:08,994 --> 00:38:11,740
that's gonna keep you going,

620
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,810
and I hope
I don't bore you with...

621
00:38:16,803 --> 00:38:18,539
With my rambling.

622
00:38:19,208 --> 00:38:21,883
Say the call letters.
The call letters, y'all.

623
00:38:34,059 --> 00:38:37,161
What the fuck is going on? You
didn't come here drunk, did you?

624
00:38:37,232 --> 00:38:38,729
Oh, shit.

625
00:38:39,219 --> 00:38:40,502
No, man.

626
00:38:41,974 --> 00:38:44,612
I ain't drunk.
It's nerves, man. I'm nervous.

627
00:38:44,692 --> 00:38:47,129
Nerves or not, you better
get your ass back in there.

628
00:38:47,203 --> 00:38:48,486
My ass is on the line!

629
00:38:48,562 --> 00:38:50,404
I don't wanna hear some
fucking Sunny Jim knock off.

630
00:38:50,479 --> 00:38:52,107
I want Petey Greene, damn it!

631
00:38:52,188 --> 00:38:54,731
Stop putting your goddamn
hands on me, man!

632
00:38:54,803 --> 00:38:55,944
I ain't no punk, fool.

633
00:38:56,022 --> 00:39:00,682
Well, stop acting like one and get
back in there before the song ends!

634
00:39:00,763 --> 00:39:02,260
Move, man.

635
00:39:08,572 --> 00:39:09,749
Here.

636
00:39:30,849 --> 00:39:33,107
Got some bullshit...

637
00:39:49,954 --> 00:39:54,196
Well, that was a little funk
to get you through your morning

638
00:39:54,276 --> 00:39:58,876
over your yawning, put the pep in
your step, and a glide in your stride.

639
00:40:00,098 --> 00:40:03,259
Well, over the break,
I was asked to be myself.

640
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:05,633
So, who is Petey Greene?

641
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:10,762
Well, I got an eighth-grade education
with a Ph.D. From the streets.

642
00:40:11,533 --> 00:40:15,181
I'm a recovering alcoholic,
been sober five hours.

643
00:40:15,925 --> 00:40:18,706
But I ain't touched a needle
in over eight years, y'all.

644
00:40:18,784 --> 00:40:21,910
That's right.
Kicked heroin dead in its ass.

645
00:40:22,339 --> 00:40:24,942
I been incarcerated
over half my life,

646
00:40:25,023 --> 00:40:27,389
most recently down at Lorton.

647
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:30,802
My mama been in jail
for 30 years,

648
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,256
and as we speak my daddy's
pulling 21 in Alcatraz.

649
00:40:35,343 --> 00:40:37,363
I am an all-around hustler,

650
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:41,226
and some of my best friends
is pimps, whores and gamblers.

651
00:40:43,047 --> 00:40:45,828
But I guess that don't make me
no different than Berry Gordy.

652
00:40:45,906 --> 00:40:47,986
And hell,
that brother own a label!

653
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:51,927
I'm in pretty good company.

654
00:40:52,006 --> 00:40:55,382
Maybe I'll own a label
one day, y'all. "P-Town."

655
00:40:56,225 --> 00:40:57,961
So this is me, y'all.

656
00:40:58,038 --> 00:41:01,033
And you ain't gotta worry about me
giving you nothing but the sho'nuff,

657
00:41:01,106 --> 00:41:02,805
'cause that's all I know.

658
00:41:03,825 --> 00:41:06,297
This is P-Town, y'all.

659
00:41:09,647 --> 00:41:13,023
Are you out of your mind, saying
those things about Berry Gordy?

660
00:41:13,098 --> 00:41:15,879
Oh, man, I ain't said nothing
that black folk don't already know.

661
00:41:15,956 --> 00:41:18,037
You will apologize
immediately,

662
00:41:18,118 --> 00:41:21,185
or I pull the plug
on this whole sorry mess.

663
00:41:22,755 --> 00:41:23,825
Okay.

664
00:41:23,905 --> 00:41:25,224
What?

665
00:41:26,276 --> 00:41:27,631
I will apologize.

666
00:41:27,705 --> 00:41:29,060
Now!

667
00:41:30,459 --> 00:41:32,575
You said you wanted
Petey Greene, man!

668
00:41:32,655 --> 00:41:34,736
Just apologize.

669
00:41:36,036 --> 00:41:37,664
Just apologize.

670
00:41:39,384 --> 00:41:40,917
I'm going by.

671
00:41:43,009 --> 00:41:45,612
I'll tell you what, man.

672
00:41:47,785 --> 00:41:49,377
Open the mike.

673
00:41:50,365 --> 00:41:52,967
Sorry I had to break in now
on you ladies and gentlemen.

674
00:41:53,049 --> 00:41:55,521
I know you was
enjoying it, too.

675
00:41:55,943 --> 00:41:58,415
But in all seriousness, folks,

676
00:41:59,603 --> 00:42:04,856
I gotta apologize about something that I
said a little earlier that upset some folks.

677
00:42:05,704 --> 00:42:07,760
I gotta apologize
to Mr. Berry Gordy

678
00:42:07,831 --> 00:42:10,992
for making him out
to be a hustler and a pimp.

679
00:42:12,293 --> 00:42:16,953
Mr. Gordy's a very important
man, and he's done a great deal.

680
00:42:19,614 --> 00:42:23,549
And I love the way he takes
the little brothers and sisters,

681
00:42:24,355 --> 00:42:28,326
broke-down runaways, the
downtrodden from the projects,

682
00:42:28,399 --> 00:42:30,977
and he gets them
off the streets.

683
00:42:31,293 --> 00:42:35,714
Then he puts a few dollars in their pockets,
teaches them how to talk and how to walk,

684
00:42:35,790 --> 00:42:39,475
then sends them right back out there
to bring him a whole lot of money.

685
00:42:39,554 --> 00:42:44,011
So I'm sorry if in any way
I made him out to be a pimp.

686
00:42:44,086 --> 00:42:47,462
That ain't pimping, y'all! That's
just good old-fashioned hit-making!

687
00:42:47,537 --> 00:42:48,678
Studio One.

688
00:42:48,758 --> 00:42:51,159
So why don't we hear us another
one of them good old-fashioned...

689
00:42:51,233 --> 00:42:53,218
Mr. Sonderling,
Motown's DC rep's on the line.

690
00:42:53,290 --> 00:42:54,502
Yeah.

691
00:42:55,904 --> 00:43:00,112
And again, I sincerely
apologize, Mr. Berry Gordy,

692
00:43:00,367 --> 00:43:02,696
from the bottom of my heart.

693
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:04,923
This is Petey Greene.

694
00:43:05,003 --> 00:43:06,774
I'll call you back.

695
00:43:13,405 --> 00:43:15,247
Something like that, boss?

696
00:43:15,323 --> 00:43:21,551
Mr. Greene, you may have just cost me my
FCC license and a whole lot more. Get out.

697
00:43:21,632 --> 00:43:25,567
And you obviously can't handle
your new responsibility,

698
00:43:25,641 --> 00:43:27,174
so you don't have it anymore.

699
00:43:27,245 --> 00:43:30,621
Call Jim. He's back on
tomorrow. Same time.

700
00:43:35,577 --> 00:43:39,404
What the fuck was that?
Motown is Hitsville, U.S.A.

701
00:43:39,482 --> 00:43:41,359
This is a radio station,
Petey!

702
00:43:41,433 --> 00:43:43,275
We can't afford
to have them angry with us!

703
00:43:43,351 --> 00:43:44,456
"We"?

704
00:43:45,442 --> 00:43:48,675
Did I miss something, or didn't
your ass just get demoted?

705
00:43:48,754 --> 00:43:50,181
But hey, like Malcolm say,

706
00:43:50,254 --> 00:43:53,736
"When the master sick, house
niggas say, 'We's sick."'

707
00:43:54,646 --> 00:43:56,726
Oh, you're a self-righteous
field nigga, huh?

708
00:43:56,808 --> 00:43:59,589
You goddamn right!
Well, you just lost a job,

709
00:43:59,666 --> 00:44:01,128
field nigga!

710
00:44:04,303 --> 00:44:05,765
Hey, man.

711
00:44:06,395 --> 00:44:07,678
Hey, man!

712
00:44:08,661 --> 00:44:10,289
At least I know who I am.

713
00:44:10,578 --> 00:44:12,658
I'm Petey Greene, and
I'm gonna keep talking shit!

714
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:13,810
Yeah?
Yeah.

715
00:44:13,890 --> 00:44:17,788
For all the shit you talk, you
still can't sink a nine ball.

716
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:26,017
<i>We're slowing it down tonight
on WOL.</i>

717
00:44:26,091 --> 00:44:30,787
<i>This is The Hawk, taking you
into midnight. The Love Hawk...</i>

718
00:44:30,867 --> 00:44:32,709
How many times I gotta tell
you the same thing, man?

719
00:44:32,784 --> 00:44:34,591
Oh, man! It's all about
Motown, baby. Motown!

720
00:44:34,667 --> 00:44:37,377
That nigga this morning?
He was telling the truth!

721
00:44:37,457 --> 00:44:41,736
Come on, man, Berry Gordy
ain't no pimp. Shit!

722
00:44:41,814 --> 00:44:44,774
You see, the problem with
trying to be somebody y'all...

723
00:44:44,847 --> 00:44:47,449
You telling me
a nigga in America,

724
00:44:47,531 --> 00:44:49,789
with that much money...
Why not? You're ignorant.

725
00:44:49,867 --> 00:44:53,659
Oh yeah? You're just telling it
like it is, just like Petey Greene.

726
00:44:53,737 --> 00:44:56,969
No, I'm telling you. Why you think
they snatched him off the air so fast

727
00:44:57,049 --> 00:45:00,389
if he wasn't telling the
truth? C- O-N-spiracy.

728
00:45:00,849 --> 00:45:02,096
See, you're right
about the con part.

729
00:45:02,173 --> 00:45:03,872
That's why they took
his black ass off the air.

730
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:05,793
Berry Gordy is
a stand-up brother.

731
00:45:05,868 --> 00:45:10,040
Don't nobody want to hear some con talking
mess about somebody like Berry Gordy.

732
00:45:10,121 --> 00:45:11,227
Right.
Come on.

733
00:45:11,307 --> 00:45:15,658
I would rather listen to a con
than this sucker-for-Iove-ass nigga.

734
00:45:15,734 --> 00:45:17,885
Petey Greene was cool, but that
white boy that was with him...

735
00:45:17,966 --> 00:45:19,249
Oh, God!

736
00:45:21,033 --> 00:45:23,434
You okay?
Yeah.

737
00:45:26,402 --> 00:45:29,147
Guys, drinks are on me, okay?

738
00:45:29,993 --> 00:45:31,549
See that, now,
I could get with that.

739
00:45:31,631 --> 00:45:34,209
Thank you, my brother.
Thank you, my brother.

740
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:36,361
Yo, bartender.
Thank you.

741
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:37,999
Right on.
How much you leaving, man?

742
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:39,708
Hey, hey. Keep it coming.
Right on, Kevin.

743
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:06,631
You ready to shake up
the world, radio man?

744
00:46:07,469 --> 00:46:09,976
Let me ask you something, man.

745
00:46:10,048 --> 00:46:11,510
Why, huh?

746
00:46:13,326 --> 00:46:16,392
Why should I put my ass
on the line for you?

747
00:46:18,589 --> 00:46:22,595
Why should I give up
all this right here

748
00:46:22,947 --> 00:46:25,098
and take a chance on you?

749
00:46:28,594 --> 00:46:30,436
I guess I need you

750
00:46:31,454 --> 00:46:34,129
to say the things
I'm afraid to say.

751
00:46:36,578 --> 00:46:38,455
And you need me to

752
00:46:42,923 --> 00:46:45,811
do the things
you're afraid to do.

753
00:46:48,605 --> 00:46:50,032
Damn, that was deep.

754
00:46:50,209 --> 00:46:52,955
Yeah. It was, wasn't it?
Yeah. It was good, man.

755
00:46:53,869 --> 00:46:56,995
You should put that shit
on a greeting card.

756
00:46:58,750 --> 00:47:01,674
Go on, chump. Rack them.

757
00:47:02,968 --> 00:47:04,561
See if I can't
teach you something.

758
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:08,119
Yeah.

759
00:47:09,173 --> 00:47:10,600
Hey, Jim.

760
00:47:11,684 --> 00:47:15,856
I just wanna apologize about what
happened and welcome you back.

761
00:47:17,645 --> 00:47:21,258
Come on, let's not fight.
We still gotta work together.

762
00:47:21,933 --> 00:47:24,084
Fan mail.
That's great.

763
00:47:24,652 --> 00:47:27,160
I'm gonna get some coffee.
You want some?

764
00:47:28,313 --> 00:47:29,870
Come on, Jim.

765
00:47:31,241 --> 00:47:32,274
Black. Two sugars.

766
00:47:32,357 --> 00:47:34,377
Okay. Okay.

767
00:48:06,974 --> 00:48:08,365
Dewey! Hey!

768
00:48:12,622 --> 00:48:14,179
Is Jim in his office?
No, I just checked.

769
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:15,294
He's probably
in the men's room.

770
00:48:15,376 --> 00:48:19,132
You go get him. I'll stall in
there for a couple of minutes, okay?

771
00:48:25,137 --> 00:48:26,908
I thought that kind of work
was beneath you.

772
00:48:26,985 --> 00:48:30,111
Hey, doing this shit is how I got
thrown in the joint in the first place.

773
00:48:30,192 --> 00:48:33,222
Well, then this should feel
good. You're on in five!

774
00:48:43,056 --> 00:48:47,584
<i>Wake up, God damn it! Petey
Greene is back on the scene!</i>

775
00:48:47,657 --> 00:48:49,393
<i>And this ain't Washington DC.</i>

776
00:48:49,470 --> 00:48:51,027
<i>No, this is P-Town!</i>

777
00:48:51,108 --> 00:48:52,772
Did you miss me?

778
00:48:52,852 --> 00:48:57,380
Well, I missed y'all, too. Had to
cut it a little short yesterday.

779
00:48:57,454 --> 00:48:58,772
<i>Man, I don't know
who's worse, though...</i>

780
00:48:58,848 --> 00:49:01,000
Freda, help!
I'm locked in my office!

781
00:49:01,079 --> 00:49:03,159
<i>See, a negro get
a little money in his pocket,</i>

782
00:49:03,241 --> 00:49:06,581
<i>and now we can't talk about it
no more? Shoot!</i>

783
00:49:06,657 --> 00:49:08,214
<i>Look here, man...</i>

784
00:49:08,295 --> 00:49:11,255
Freda! Excuse me, I seem
to be locked in my office.

785
00:49:11,328 --> 00:49:13,135
<i>Could you give me a hand,
please?... I'm on the air,</i>

786
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:14,915
which may not be much longer,

787
00:49:14,989 --> 00:49:16,938
so I'm gonna go on ahead
and get my money's worth.

788
00:49:17,011 --> 00:49:20,696
They're gonna have to take my
title, just like they did Ali.

789
00:49:21,195 --> 00:49:22,894
And see, that's what
I'm talking about right there.

790
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:25,477
<i>Freda! A black man can only say so much</i>

791
00:49:25,552 --> 00:49:27,288
<i>in this so-called
free country,</i>

792
00:49:27,365 --> 00:49:28,613
till they break you down.

793
00:49:28,690 --> 00:49:30,841
Well, guess what?
I'm telling it.

794
00:49:30,921 --> 00:49:33,631
That's right, and I'm
gonna keep on telling it.

795
00:49:33,709 --> 00:49:36,347
Some of it you're gonna like,
some of it you ain't.

796
00:49:36,429 --> 00:49:39,175
If you got something to say,
give me a call.

797
00:49:39,253 --> 00:49:40,358
If you disagree,
tell me like a man.

798
00:49:40,438 --> 00:49:41,650
Dewey, have you
lost your mind?

799
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:43,749
Open this door right now!
Even if you're a woman.

800
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:45,971
Mr. Greene, sir,
you are trespassing!

801
00:49:46,050 --> 00:49:49,949
I'm tired of hearing fools complaining
in barber chairs and beauty shops.

802
00:49:50,025 --> 00:49:51,688
Let your opinion out.

803
00:49:51,803 --> 00:49:58,174
Come on and give me a call at this
station. The number is 215-JK5-0199.

804
00:49:58,496 --> 00:50:00,303
Somebody tell Freda to call
the cops. That number again,

805
00:50:00,379 --> 00:50:03,969
215-JK5-0199. Dewey, this
is outrageous. Open the door!

806
00:50:04,039 --> 00:50:07,521
And now, old Petey gonna play
a little non-Motown for you.

807
00:50:07,595 --> 00:50:12,088
Dewey, open this door. You're
both in trouble. Do you hear me?

808
00:50:12,162 --> 00:50:13,588
You are in real trouble,
mister!

809
00:50:13,661 --> 00:50:14,802
Come on.

810
00:50:14,881 --> 00:50:17,174
Come out of there
right now.

811
00:50:17,251 --> 00:50:18,606
I'm not kidding!

812
00:50:19,866 --> 00:50:22,124
Dewey, you're not...

813
00:50:22,516 --> 00:50:23,728
WOL.

814
00:50:24,572 --> 00:50:26,652
Yeah. Yeah.

815
00:50:27,117 --> 00:50:28,924
Putting you through.

816
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:31,718
Talk to me.

817
00:50:31,789 --> 00:50:33,215
<i>Is this Petey Greene?
Sure is.</i>

818
00:50:33,288 --> 00:50:36,485
<i>Petey, didn't I see you last week
down at the strip club on 14th Street?</i>

819
00:50:36,565 --> 00:50:39,632
Oh, yeah, I was down there.
Wasn't to see no show.

820
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:42,449
But that don't mean I mind the
company of shake-dancers. No.

821
00:50:42,526 --> 00:50:44,439
My girl, Vernell,
she used to be shake-dancer.

822
00:50:44,513 --> 00:50:45,654
She has a bar down there now.

823
00:50:45,734 --> 00:50:47,160
What do you think
you're trying to prove?

824
00:50:47,233 --> 00:50:48,551
Yeah, I had to go
over there...

825
00:50:48,627 --> 00:50:51,134
WOL....and we'll talk
about this, do you hear me?

826
00:50:51,207 --> 00:50:54,095
That's right. Putting you
through now. Look, don't touch!

827
00:50:54,763 --> 00:50:56,426
Again.
Talk to me.

828
00:50:56,506 --> 00:50:57,896
<i>Petey,
I agree with you, man.</i>

829
00:50:57,970 --> 00:51:02,178
<i>All them record guys are pimps, just
like most lawyers and politicians.</i>

830
00:51:02,258 --> 00:51:04,279
<i>You give them all hell!
You know I will.</i>

831
00:51:04,350 --> 00:51:08,462
Do you hear me?
Come on. Dewey!

832
00:51:08,987 --> 00:51:11,910
No, no, no, no. Put it
straight through on the board.

833
00:51:11,984 --> 00:51:14,100
Line three. On the board.

834
00:51:15,087 --> 00:51:16,406
Dewey?
Talk to me.

835
00:51:16,481 --> 00:51:19,583
<i>What you think about that kid
being killed by the pigs last week?</i>

836
00:51:19,654 --> 00:51:21,532
I'll tell you what I think.

837
00:51:21,710 --> 00:51:23,862
Black folk life
ain't worth nothing.

838
00:51:23,942 --> 00:51:26,272
One day, black folk ain't
gonna take that no more

839
00:51:26,347 --> 00:51:28,569
and when that day happens...

840
00:51:31,472 --> 00:51:34,289
Do you realize what you've
done? Are you trying to ruin me?

841
00:51:34,365 --> 00:51:36,623
Hot mike, man.
Oh, for crying out loud.

842
00:51:36,701 --> 00:51:37,949
I'm sorry, sir,
it was the only way.

843
00:51:38,026 --> 00:51:40,462
You just let this fellow ruin your
career. You're finished, Dewey.

844
00:51:40,536 --> 00:51:42,901
You're making a mistake, sir.
You can't see it, but I can.

845
00:51:42,976 --> 00:51:45,900
If you throw us out, we're
gonna walk straight over to WOOK.

846
00:51:45,975 --> 00:51:47,436
Good! That will help
our ratings.

847
00:51:47,509 --> 00:51:51,407
Gentlemen, will you kindly escort
these men out of the building?

848
00:51:51,483 --> 00:51:54,716
Sir? I've been trying
to call the police,

849
00:51:54,794 --> 00:51:56,874
but all our lines
have been flooded.

850
00:51:56,956 --> 00:51:58,026
What?

851
00:51:58,106 --> 00:52:01,101
The operator can't handle
the volume, sir.

852
00:52:03,719 --> 00:52:05,632
Are these listener calls?

853
00:52:05,706 --> 00:52:07,512
I think so.

854
00:52:09,297 --> 00:52:10,925
Wait a minute.

855
00:52:15,502 --> 00:52:17,308
Good morning, WOL.

856
00:52:19,232 --> 00:52:20,444
Yes, ma'am, he is,

857
00:52:20,522 --> 00:52:25,680
but I'm afraid he's real busy right now.
You know, we're getting a lot of calls.

858
00:52:25,751 --> 00:52:28,354
Yes ma'am, I will,
and thank you.

859
00:52:28,923 --> 00:52:30,623
Keep listening.

860
00:52:32,723 --> 00:52:36,479
Morning music and a talk
show, with a man of the people.

861
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:39,756
Because WOL is
a station of the people,

862
00:52:40,498 --> 00:52:41,924
for the people,

863
00:52:42,415 --> 00:52:43,770
by the people.

864
00:52:43,844 --> 00:52:44,985
I'm the people.

865
00:52:45,065 --> 00:52:47,739
He'll be a hit, sir.
I promise you that.

866
00:52:51,619 --> 00:52:54,579
All right, thank you all.
Everything's fine here.

867
00:52:54,652 --> 00:52:57,683
Let's all get back to work.
Thank you again.

868
00:52:59,184 --> 00:53:01,549
The next time you decide
to make a personnel change,

869
00:53:01,624 --> 00:53:03,050
at least put it in a memo.

870
00:53:03,123 --> 00:53:06,356
Hold it. You can't give
this thug a job.

871
00:53:06,435 --> 00:53:08,098
Man, I got your thug
right here. Ten inches.

872
00:53:08,178 --> 00:53:09,805
Oh, for heaven's sake.
Be cool, Jim.

873
00:53:09,886 --> 00:53:12,809
What?
We'll talk. We'll talk, okay?

874
00:53:12,884 --> 00:53:15,915
I want him on a short leash.
A very short leash.

875
00:53:15,986 --> 00:53:18,043
And I want a morals clause
in your contract.

876
00:53:18,114 --> 00:53:19,670
Fine, man, whatever.
I'll sign it.

877
00:53:19,752 --> 00:53:21,868
Just let me get back to
work, okay? Jim, wait up.

878
00:53:21,948 --> 00:53:23,826
Can I get back to work?

879
00:53:23,901 --> 00:53:26,052
All right. But you watch
your language. All right!

880
00:53:26,132 --> 00:53:29,234
And you keep an eye on him.
Thank you, sir.

881
00:53:30,001 --> 00:53:32,367
All right,
let's get busy here.

882
00:53:40,181 --> 00:53:42,058
I love that song!

883
00:53:42,133 --> 00:53:44,498
Reminds me of summertime
on the beach

884
00:53:44,573 --> 00:53:47,640
trying to get some foxy coed
to rub some lotion on me.

885
00:53:47,711 --> 00:53:49,101
Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.

886
00:53:49,558 --> 00:53:52,446
<i>Well, in case you been asleep at
the wheel, this is Petey Greene.</i>

887
00:53:52,522 --> 00:53:53,592
Hello, caller,
what's your name?

888
00:53:53,672 --> 00:53:55,658
<i>And you ain't in Washington,
DC no more, Dorothy.</i>

889
00:53:55,729 --> 00:53:57,047
<i>No, this is P-Town.
All right, Tom, please hold.</i>

890
00:53:57,123 --> 00:53:58,859
Hello, caller, what's
your name? WOL-AM.

891
00:53:58,936 --> 00:53:59,518
Hello, James.

892
00:54:27,279 --> 00:54:29,715
My granny,
I call her Aunt Pig,

893
00:54:29,789 --> 00:54:33,724
Aunt Pig say, "Petey,
why you always in jail?"

894
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:37,518
<i>I tell her I don't know.
"I don't know, Aunt Pig."</i>

895
00:54:37,598 --> 00:54:40,665
<i>Then one day
I read my indictment papers,</i>

896
00:54:40,736 --> 00:54:46,311
<i>they say, "Ralph Waldo Greene versus
the United States of America. "</i>

897
00:54:46,383 --> 00:54:49,378
<i>I said, "Damn! No wonder
I ain't been winning!"</i>

898
00:54:49,450 --> 00:54:50,733
He's talking about...

899
00:54:50,811 --> 00:54:54,496
<i>And I don't care what nobody say,
ain't nothing like a black woman.</i>

900
00:54:54,575 --> 00:54:57,392
<i>Now, that ain't to say
I ain't dabbled before.</i>

901
00:54:57,469 --> 00:55:00,809
I mean, I dabbled, man,
I'm a good old dabbler.

902
00:55:01,059 --> 00:55:06,277
<i>But give me a sister with big
hips, big legs and a big old 'fro,</i>

903
00:55:06,358 --> 00:55:09,460
<i>and you ain't got to worry
about me no more.</i>

904
00:55:12,006 --> 00:55:14,372
Hey, hey, hey!
Fan mail.

905
00:55:15,038 --> 00:55:16,987
How many for The Hawk?

906
00:55:19,187 --> 00:55:20,578
Three?

907
00:55:20,652 --> 00:55:22,007
Sorry.

908
00:55:23,441 --> 00:55:25,556
Gave you one of Petey's.

909
00:55:27,589 --> 00:55:29,811
Y'all listen everyday, huh?

910
00:55:32,749 --> 00:55:33,782
Ain't you, now!

911
00:55:33,864 --> 00:55:35,219
Check it out.
Yeah.

912
00:55:44,985 --> 00:55:47,136
Talk to me, Petey! Talk to me!

913
00:55:47,391 --> 00:55:50,208
Talk to me! Want me to talk
to you? I'll talk to you.

914
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:54,177
God damn it!

915
00:55:56,838 --> 00:55:58,335
Oh, baby.

916
00:55:58,407 --> 00:56:00,143
Let me explain.
I'm listening.

917
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:01,467
Girl, put the bottle down

918
00:56:01,545 --> 00:56:03,946
and let me talk to you.
Go on, Petey. I'm listening.

919
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:07,955
"Talk to me, Petey. Talk to me,
baby." Ain't what the bitch said?

920
00:56:08,029 --> 00:56:13,045
You tell this bitch how I was the only
one to give your sorry ass a place to stay

921
00:56:13,118 --> 00:56:15,483
when you had nowhere else
to go. Tell this bitch!

922
00:56:15,559 --> 00:56:16,771
She took me in.

923
00:56:16,849 --> 00:56:20,011
I cleaned your clothes,
and I cooked your food,

924
00:56:20,091 --> 00:56:21,862
motherfucker!
Oh, shit. Okay! Okay!

925
00:56:21,938 --> 00:56:24,446
Vernell, please. Baby,
listen, now. Don't do this.

926
00:56:24,518 --> 00:56:26,538
You don't wanna
do this here. Hold on.

927
00:56:26,609 --> 00:56:29,212
Listen, I'm sorry.

928
00:56:29,294 --> 00:56:30,649
I fucked up.
Yeah, you fucked up.

929
00:56:30,724 --> 00:56:34,409
I did. I fucked up.
I know it, baby. I know it.

930
00:56:34,488 --> 00:56:38,101
And I ain't trying to make no excuses
for it. But you don't wanna do this here.

931
00:56:38,184 --> 00:56:41,560
Vernell. Come on, baby,
put the bottle down.

932
00:56:44,912 --> 00:56:46,231
Get out.

933
00:56:49,549 --> 00:56:52,152
Nigga, didn't you hear? I
said get out! This is my joint.

934
00:56:52,233 --> 00:56:54,146
I don't give a fuck, Petey!
Get out!

935
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:56,098
Let me put some drawers on or
something. Get the fuck out!

936
00:56:56,172 --> 00:56:58,644
Don't make me say it again,
nigga. I swear to God,

937
00:56:58,717 --> 00:57:02,129
I don't wanna get more upset
than I already am with this bottle

938
00:57:02,204 --> 00:57:03,761
and get jumpy
and cut your dick off.

939
00:57:03,842 --> 00:57:07,253
You'll be sounding like Frankie
Lyman on the radio. Get the fuck out!

940
00:57:07,329 --> 00:57:08,540
All right.

941
00:57:08,618 --> 00:57:10,603
Get out.
I'm leaving.

942
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:16,177
Vernell! Baby...

943
00:57:17,996 --> 00:57:21,193
Help a nigga out, now.
Come on.

944
00:57:21,272 --> 00:57:22,628
Come on, man.
You gotta be shitting me.

945
00:57:22,702 --> 00:57:24,544
Look at me, man!
I don't want to look at you!

946
00:57:24,619 --> 00:57:27,198
I wanna get this image out of my
head. Dewey, Dewey, Dewey, listen.

947
00:57:27,269 --> 00:57:30,395
Now, Vernell kicked me out the house.
Caught me fucking some other broad, man.

948
00:57:30,476 --> 00:57:31,509
I ain't got
nowhere else to go.

949
00:57:31,592 --> 00:57:34,230
You should have thought about that
before you let your snake out the cage.

950
00:57:34,311 --> 00:57:35,867
Listen, man,
my snake's been incarcerated!

951
00:57:35,950 --> 00:57:39,598
I've been jacking off to girlie
magazines for nine damn years.

952
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:42,282
Come on, you telling me you
gonna pass up some fine-ass woman

953
00:57:42,364 --> 00:57:43,897
just throw her pussy
all up on your face?

954
00:57:43,968 --> 00:57:45,215
Hey, Dave.

955
00:57:45,292 --> 00:57:47,134
Hey, Dave!
Get in here. Come on.

956
00:57:47,210 --> 00:57:48,945
Just helping out...

957
00:57:50,417 --> 00:57:52,473
My motherfucking deuce!

958
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:59,751
Susan, this is Petey Greene. His
girlfriend kicked him out, so we gotta...

959
00:57:59,830 --> 00:58:01,363
I'll leave you two alone.
No, no, no, no, baby.

960
00:58:01,434 --> 00:58:03,977
No, no, there's no need
for that. You... Just...

961
00:58:04,361 --> 00:58:06,691
Is this what you mean by
taking your work home with you?

962
00:58:06,767 --> 00:58:08,752
Being married to your career?
Listen, listen...

963
00:58:08,823 --> 00:58:11,117
I should have known.
Come on, help me out here.

964
00:58:11,194 --> 00:58:13,310
No, no, no, no, no... Hey!

965
00:58:16,389 --> 00:58:17,422
Damn!

966
00:58:18,619 --> 00:58:22,209
Man, ain't that a bitch?
Women, man. I'm telling you.

967
00:58:23,047 --> 00:58:27,992
<i>I've been loving you...</i>

968
00:58:30,438 --> 00:58:33,635
<i>too long, Vernell</i>

969
00:58:34,517 --> 00:58:37,679
<i>to stop now</i>

970
00:58:43,755 --> 00:58:46,192
<i>You are...</i>

971
00:58:48,078 --> 00:58:49,705
Shut the hell up, man.

972
00:58:50,099 --> 00:58:51,133
Put that on!

973
00:58:53,935 --> 00:58:55,812
I'm sorry, Dewey.

974
00:59:01,883 --> 00:59:03,725
I fucked up, man.

975
00:59:03,801 --> 00:59:05,119
Oh, shit.

976
00:59:06,415 --> 00:59:08,364
I fucked up, didn't I?

977
00:59:13,282 --> 00:59:15,754
Shit. Just...

978
00:59:17,222 --> 00:59:23,178
Just give her a chance to cool off,
man, and then you'll talk, okay?

979
00:59:23,253 --> 00:59:26,379
She don't wanna
talk to me. She mad at me.

980
00:59:26,461 --> 00:59:31,298
She loves you.
She loves you, okay?

981
00:59:31,376 --> 00:59:32,909
Yeah.
Okay?

982
00:59:32,979 --> 00:59:35,000
Yeah. Yeah.

983
00:59:36,745 --> 00:59:38,693
You're a good friend, Dewey.

984
00:59:38,766 --> 00:59:40,430
Okay.

985
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:43,505
You're a good friend. Yeah.
Yeah, it's... Okay, man.

986
00:59:43,578 --> 00:59:46,050
Thank you, man.
Okay! Okay! Okay. Come on.

987
00:59:46,123 --> 00:59:47,441
Okay.

988
00:59:52,711 --> 00:59:54,375
Get some sleep.

989
00:59:56,965 --> 00:59:58,212
Get some sleep.

990
01:00:00,486 --> 01:00:02,886
I'll talk to you in the
morning, Dewey. Tomorrow.

991
01:00:02,961 --> 01:00:05,041
Okay.
In the morning, man.

992
01:00:05,122 --> 01:00:06,750
Crazy little...

993
01:00:10,978 --> 01:00:12,190
Shit.

994
01:00:15,615 --> 01:00:16,934
Oh, man.

995
01:00:21,890 --> 01:00:25,337
I appreciate, you know, you letting me
stay at your place again, bro, but...

996
01:00:25,411 --> 01:00:26,623
Come on, man.
Good night, sir.

997
01:00:26,701 --> 01:00:28,091
Gonna have to give me
some more threads. I can't...

998
01:00:28,165 --> 01:00:30,246
I'm not giving you
any more of my clothes.

999
01:00:30,327 --> 01:00:31,433
Man...

1000
01:00:31,512 --> 01:00:33,805
Good night, Mike.
Good night.

1001
01:00:34,092 --> 01:00:35,125
Good night, Jim.
Good night.

1002
01:00:35,207 --> 01:00:37,085
"Night, Jim.

1003
01:00:37,159 --> 01:00:38,442
"Have a nice weekend."

1004
01:00:38,519 --> 01:00:39,981
I don't talk like that.

1005
01:00:40,053 --> 01:00:41,931
Yeah, you talk
exactly like that.

1006
01:00:42,005 --> 01:00:44,857
And you walk like you got a
stick broke off in your ass, man.

1007
01:00:44,933 --> 01:00:46,775
I walk with confidence,
like Johnny Carson.

1008
01:00:46,851 --> 01:00:50,155
You could learn something
from him. Good night...

1009
01:00:50,861 --> 01:00:52,976
Those are my gators, man.

1010
01:00:58,425 --> 01:00:59,922
This all my...

1011
01:01:05,781 --> 01:01:07,552
Is she still here?

1012
01:01:23,072 --> 01:01:24,664
Now we're even.

1013
01:01:31,195 --> 01:01:33,311
Oh, no, she didn't.
Hold on. Hold on.

1014
01:01:33,391 --> 01:01:35,507
No, she... You don't
understand. Calm down, Petey.

1015
01:01:35,588 --> 01:01:37,845
Move, Dewey, move!
Calm down.

1016
01:01:39,701 --> 01:01:41,364
You enjoy yourself, nigga?

1017
01:01:41,445 --> 01:01:43,358
Don't blame me.
It's the voice.

1018
01:01:43,432 --> 01:01:44,787
Oh, is it?

1019
01:01:45,767 --> 01:01:48,370
Oh, fuck. Okay,
hold on, now, let me...

1020
01:02:13,412 --> 01:02:15,635
Mr. Sonderling! Mr.
Sonderling, he tried to kill me!

1021
01:02:15,713 --> 01:02:17,626
He tried to kill me.

1022
01:02:23,209 --> 01:02:26,168
I'm gonna need you
on the air, right away.

1023
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:30,526
What is it?

1024
01:02:36,317 --> 01:02:38,574
<i>Once again, this just in.</i>

1025
01:02:39,071 --> 01:02:40,283
Oh, man...

1026
01:02:41,546 --> 01:02:44,398
<i>Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.,</i>

1027
01:02:45,729 --> 01:02:49,342

of the Civil Rights Movement,

1029
01:03:01,242 --> 01:03:07,375

by an assassin's bullet

1030

this evening.

1031
01:03:12,990 --> 01:03:16,544
They got him, y'all.
They got him.

1032
01:03:21,567 --> 01:03:23,825
Only 39 years old,

1033
01:03:25,576 --> 01:03:30,413
Dr. King leaves behind
his wife, Coretta, and...

1034
01:03:38,405 --> 01:03:40,105
I'm sorry, y'all.

1035
01:03:41,613 --> 01:03:43,561
I'm just tired of this.

1036
01:03:46,457 --> 01:03:49,654
I don't know
if I'm more sad or angry.

1037
01:03:49,735 --> 01:03:52,445
I'm tired of them
taking our leaders!

1038
01:03:54,441 --> 01:03:56,984
I know you are, too.

1039
01:04:00,368 --> 01:04:03,981
This is WOL, 1450 AM.

1040
01:04:13,266 --> 01:04:14,763
They're burning down DC.

1041

What?
They're burning it down.

1042
01:04:20,064 --> 01:04:22,121
They're burning it down.

1043
01:04:47,082 --> 01:04:48,115

Come on! Come on!
No, stop. Stop! Stop!

Stop it, man!

1052
01:05:39,235 --> 01:05:40,269
Y'all! Run!

1053
01:05:47,428 --> 01:05:49,721
Thank you.
Now, go on. Go on.

1054
01:05:54,295 --> 01:05:56,838
I got to get back

Yeah, buddy,
it's a dark day in America.

1060
01:06:30,342 --> 01:06:32,743
Got to be one of the
darkest days I ever seen,

1061
01:06:32,817 --> 01:06:34,552
and I seen more than most.

1062
01:06:34,630 --> 01:06:37,031
WOL. Yeah, hold for Petey.

1063
01:06:37,105 --> 01:06:39,743
In Washington,
this is Petey Greene.

1064
01:06:40,068 --> 01:06:41,494
Talk to me.

1065
01:06:41,567 --> 01:06:43,516
<i>It can't go down
like that, Petey.</i>

1066

<i>I know you're hurting. We all
hurting. He the only one we had, Petey.</i>

1069
01:06:52,792 --> 01:06:55,431
I know how angry you are.

1070
01:06:55,512 --> 01:06:59,648
You want revenge, you want that
quart of blood, and I don't blame you.

1071
01:07:02,379 --> 01:07:04,982
But I want y'all to just go
take a look out your windows.

1072
01:07:05,064 --> 01:07:06,525
I mean,
those of you that got them.

1073
01:07:06,598 --> 01:07:10,152
Just take a look outside
and tell me what you see.

1074
01:07:10,224 --> 01:07:12,934
<i>You see a city on fire.</i>

1075
01:07:13,012 --> 01:07:14,676
<i>Now, that's your city.</i>

1076
01:07:14,895 --> 01:07:15,928
<i>Our city.</i>

1077
01:07:16,116 --> 01:07:19,348
<i>And that's not what Dr. King
would have wanted.</i>

1078
01:07:20,682 --> 01:07:26,222
Now, I ain't nothing, man, I ain't
nothing but a con and a thief.

1079
01:07:26,295 --> 01:07:28,970
So I ain't up here trying
to be nobody's preacher.

1080
01:07:29,049 --> 01:07:32,211
I'm just trying to tell the truth
to y'all, like I promised I would,

1081
01:07:32,291 --> 01:07:37,307
and the truth is, I went to
jail 'cause I was a knucklehead.

1082
01:07:37,380 --> 01:07:43,157
<i>Dr. King went to jail for what he
stood for, fought for, and died for.</i>

<i>The man was a giant. Now,
if they could do that to him,</i>

won't cut you down like a dog, too.</i>

1087
01:07:55,195 --> 01:07:59,891
<i>So look here. If you at home,
please, just stay home.</i>

1088
01:07:59,971 --> 01:08:03,073
<i>And if you out in these
streets, man, go home.</i>

1089
01:08:03,143 --> 01:08:07,220
<i>Put your anger away till
we can sort all this mess out.</i>

1090
01:08:07,292 --> 01:08:11,607
<i>I ain't saying I know how we gonna
do it. I just know that we will.</i>

1091
01:08:11,684 --> 01:08:13,907
We shall overcome.

1092
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:18,263
Hold on a second, now.

1093
01:08:18,517 --> 01:08:20,288
<i>Petey, there's a free concert
tomorrow night.</i>

1094

<i>You and James Brown,
Georgetown University.</i>

01:08:22,771 --> 01:08:26,705
Okay, I've just been told
that tomorrow night,

1096
01:08:26,780 --> 01:08:30,048
Mr. James Brown,
the Godfather of Soul,

1097
01:08:30,126 --> 01:08:34,203

show, that's capital-F-R-E-E,

1098
01:08:34,275 --> 01:08:36,605
at Georgetown University.

1099
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:40,817
Bring your heartache, bring your
anger, just bring all that to me,

1100
01:08:40,898 --> 01:08:44,939
and we gonna work it out together.
We gonna get through this, people.

1101
01:08:46,023 --> 01:08:48,495
WOL. Hold for Petey.
Talk to me.

1102
01:08:48,568 --> 01:08:52,359
<i>Petey, I just keep
crying and crying. I just...</i>

1103
01:08:52,438 --> 01:08:55,743
WOL. Yeah, hold for Petey.

1104
01:08:55,959 --> 01:09:02,580
Well, the clock on the wall
says it's time to go.

1105
01:09:03,071 --> 01:09:06,268
That's the end of my show,
and there ain't no more.

1106
01:09:06,347 --> 01:09:09,509
But before I go,
I wanna leave y'all with this.

1107
01:09:12,552 --> 01:09:15,654
"The ultimate measure of a man

1108
01:09:15,969 --> 01:09:21,781
"is not where he stands in
moments of comfort and convenience,

1109
01:09:21,860 --> 01:09:27,043
"but where he stands in times
of challenge and controversy."

1110
01:09:28,066 --> 01:09:33,676
And no, those ain't words of
advice from old Petey Greene.

1111
01:09:33,888 --> 01:09:38,655
Those are pearls of wisdom
from Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.

1112
01:09:42,758 --> 01:09:46,620
<i>Like the brother said,
I'm Petey Greene.</i>

1113

<i>Good evening, Washington,

<i>I'm happy you could make it.</i>

1115
01:09:58,411 --> 01:10:00,431
<i>I'm glad you could show.</i>

1116
01:10:01,827 --> 01:10:06,428
<i>But the government's the most happy, 'cause
y'all ain't burning down shit no more.</i>

1117
01:10:10,299 --> 01:10:13,603
<i>On my way over here,
this white man say,</i>

1118
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:16,948
<i>"Mr. Greene, why them niggers
lose their mind</i>

1119
01:10:17,027 --> 01:10:19,570
<i>"and burn their shit down
that way?"</i>

1120
01:10:21,279 --> 01:10:25,321
<i>He called me "mister,"
but called us "niggers."</i>

1121
01:10:26,265 --> 01:10:29,950
<i>I say, "Hey, we ain't the ones
that pulled that trigger!</i>

1122
01:10:31,181 --> 01:10:34,176
<i>"And if you keep
calling us niggers,</i>

1123
01:10:34,249 --> 01:10:36,234
<i>"your mothers, fathers,

1124

the grave digger. "</i>

1125
01:10:42,929 --> 01:10:46,269

we ain't filled with hate.</i>

Yeah!</i>

01:13:31,659 --> 01:13:35,307
<i>Now they wanna keep us down, 'cause
they afraid of what's gonna happen</i>

1168
01:13:35,389 --> 01:13:37,505
<i>if we stand up.</i>

1169
01:13:37,585 --> 01:13:40,508
<i>Why do you think
they send our boys off to war</i>

1170
01:13:40,584 --> 01:13:44,232
<i>instead of keeping them in school,
where they can learn to score?</i>

1171
01:13:44,314 --> 01:13:45,490
Yeah!
Yeah!

1172
01:13:45,568 --> 01:13:48,599
<i>Because the white folk know
that if we stand tall,</i>

1173
01:13:48,671 --> 01:13:52,642
<i>oh, buddy, we gonna have something
called Black Power, y'all!</i>

1174
01:13:53,726 --> 01:13:58,148
<i>Right? All of y'all
look beautiful today.</i>

1175
01:13:58,851 --> 01:14:02,227
Psychologist asked me what I thought
about the word "nigger." I said...

1176
01:14:02,302 --> 01:14:07,282
Lady, "nigger" is the greatest
stress reliever ever invented.

1177
01:14:07,357 --> 01:14:11,469
See, white man say "nigger," he ready
for a six-month hibernation, am I right?

1178
01:14:11,540 --> 01:14:12,752
But, see, a black man,

1179
01:14:12,830 --> 01:14:17,526
he could say "honkey," "ofay,"
"cracker," "peckerwood"

1180
01:14:17,606 --> 01:14:18,783
a million times,

1181
01:14:18,861 --> 01:14:20,941
still wanna go out there
and kill somebody.

1182
01:14:21,511 --> 01:14:25,754
You're gonna to have to tone it down,
Petey. I've got the FCC all over my rear.

1183
01:14:25,834 --> 01:14:29,732
Well, with all due respect,
sir, the FCC can kiss my ass.

1184
01:14:29,807 --> 01:14:31,756
I ain't saying nothing
but the truth.

1185
01:14:31,830 --> 01:14:33,113
As long as the people
wanna hear it,

1186
01:14:33,189 --> 01:14:34,401
I'm gonna keep telling it.

1187
01:14:34,479 --> 01:14:36,250
I'm gonna talk it
on the radio,

1188
01:14:36,327 --> 01:14:37,990
and I'm gonna talk it
on the streets.

1189
01:14:38,070 --> 01:14:39,733
I'm gonna talk it
to the police,

1190
01:14:39,813 --> 01:14:41,762
and even that sucker,
Tricky Dick!

1191
01:14:43,822 --> 01:14:47,471
This is P-Town, baby.
Talk to y'all tomorrow.

1192
01:14:51,387 --> 01:14:53,717
Now, that was a good one, Dew.

1193
01:14:55,431 --> 01:14:57,416
That was a great show, Petey.
Right on.

1194
01:14:57,487 --> 01:14:59,151
That was a great show.

1195
01:15:00,241 --> 01:15:02,298
Look at them.
They're still calling.

1196
01:15:02,369 --> 01:15:05,007
Oh man, what a day.
That was a hell of a day.

1197
01:15:05,087 --> 01:15:08,154
Thank you, man. Man,
you're incredible, you know?

1198
01:15:08,225 --> 01:15:11,256
I just see the things you do,
the effect you have on people...

1199
01:15:11,328 --> 01:15:13,800
It's amazing to me.
You got a gift.

1200
01:15:13,873 --> 01:15:17,249
You know? Something people
like me could only dream of.

1201
01:15:17,324 --> 01:15:19,095
I think you could go
all the way.

1202
01:15:19,172 --> 01:15:23,284
Let me be your manager.
Let me guide your career.

1203
01:15:23,390 --> 01:15:29,416
I'm talking stand-up, records, TV,
movies... I want the whole world

1204
01:15:29,491 --> 01:15:31,118
to be a part of P-Town.

1205
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:34,504
Well, I don't think the whole
world is ready for a nigga like me.

1206
01:15:34,581 --> 01:15:36,697
Well I think you're wrong.

1207
01:15:37,474 --> 01:15:39,946
I think the world's
been waiting

1208
01:15:40,611 --> 01:15:42,597
for a nigga like you.

1209
01:15:42,669 --> 01:15:44,201
What you say?

1210
01:15:48,699 --> 01:15:50,363
All right.
All right.

1211
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:05,775
You ladies ever been to vote?
How you doing, young brother?

1212
01:16:05,852 --> 01:16:10,452
Okay, vote for Shirley Chisholm.
Shirley Chisholm for President, 1972.

1213
01:16:10,523 --> 01:16:13,233
Over here, young man. Is your mom
registered? Are you registered?

1214
01:16:14,496 --> 01:16:16,719
<i>Now the judge say,
"Petey Greene,</i>

1215
01:16:16,798 --> 01:16:19,544
<i>"why you rob everybody
in the house?"</i>

1216
01:16:19,657 --> 01:16:22,688
<i>I said, "Well, your honor, they
all seemed like such nice people,</i>

1217
01:16:22,759 --> 01:16:25,682
<i>"I didn't want anybody
to feel left out. "</i>

1218
01:16:27,709 --> 01:16:30,455
<i>And I'm looking out
amongst y'all,</i>

1219
01:16:30,533 --> 01:16:33,243
<i>and there's some good old robbing
motherfuckers out here tonight.</i>

1220
01:16:33,322 --> 01:16:35,402
<i>Watch your purse, baby.</i>

1221
01:16:37,401 --> 01:16:39,100
<i>Well, I'm looking
at the dates right now.</i>

1222
01:16:39,179 --> 01:16:43,006
I got him at the Howard Theater
then the Crystal Room. He's booked.

1223
01:16:43,083 --> 01:16:45,829
Well, I can get you
a time next month.

1224
01:16:46,744 --> 01:16:48,206
Can't wait?

1225
01:16:48,591 --> 01:16:51,135
Y'all see the paper
this morning, P-Town?

1226
01:16:51,207 --> 01:16:56,152
Say "Petey Greene goes to the White
House and steals some silverware."

1227
01:16:56,226 --> 01:16:59,007
Now, come on,
that don't make no damn sense.

1228
01:16:59,084 --> 01:17:02,317
Imagine that,
a negro like me, ex-con,

1229
01:17:02,396 --> 01:17:04,619
get invited by the President
to the White House,

1230
01:17:04,697 --> 01:17:06,646
and I'm gonna run up in there
and take something?

1231
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:09,608
Come on, y'all.
I ain't that crazy.

1232
01:17:13,029 --> 01:17:15,252
Well that's all we got.
There ain't no more.

1233
01:17:15,330 --> 01:17:17,766
My time is tight,
and that's the end of my show.

1234
01:17:17,841 --> 01:17:21,252
So grab your head and make a fist.
Listen to me and remember this,

1235
01:17:21,326 --> 01:17:23,869
I tell it to the hot,
I tell it to the cold.

1236
01:17:23,941 --> 01:17:26,484
I tell it to the young,
I tell it to the old.

1237
01:17:26,555 --> 01:17:28,849
Don't want no laughing,
don't want no crying.

1238
01:17:28,962 --> 01:17:31,018
And most of all,
no signifying.

1239
01:17:31,785 --> 01:17:35,433
Tune in next week. This is
Petey Greene's Washington.

1240
01:17:36,247 --> 01:17:37,602
Be cool, y'all.

1241
01:17:39,454 --> 01:17:42,236
And we're out!
We're clear!

1242
01:17:42,662 --> 01:17:45,729
Great show, everybody.
Great show.

1243
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:47,083
We're good here.

1244
01:17:55,247 --> 01:17:56,673
We love it.

1245
01:17:57,513 --> 01:17:59,390
We'll pick you up
for 26 episodes.

1246
01:17:59,953 --> 01:18:02,354
Congratulations.
Thank you, sir.

1247
01:18:06,925 --> 01:18:10,301
They loved it. They loved it.
Local, then national.

1248
01:18:11,388 --> 01:18:13,016
We did it, man!

1249
01:18:16,338 --> 01:18:17,371
What?

1250
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:21,210
I know it sounds crazy,
man, but I...

1251
01:18:21,672 --> 01:18:25,808
I kind of miss that little old
radio station back at Lorton, man.

1252
01:18:26,134 --> 01:18:30,175
And I know it wasn't nothing
but a room and a turntable

1253
01:18:30,248 --> 01:18:32,328
with about 58 records
in crates, but I...

1254
01:18:32,409 --> 01:18:34,001
Pete, you're...

1255
01:18:34,780 --> 01:18:38,465
You're a different man now,
okay? You're not gonna be...

1256
01:18:39,172 --> 01:18:43,558
You're not going to be defined by
your prison time. Not you, Petey!

1257
01:18:47,017 --> 01:18:50,428
This is Petey Greene. Oh, we
got a good one for you tonight.

1258
01:18:50,502 --> 01:18:55,138
My guest is the funniest man I
know besides me, Mr. Dick Gregory.

1259
01:18:55,209 --> 01:18:56,492
How you doing, Dick?

1260
01:18:56,882 --> 01:18:59,984
<i>My guest tonight
is Reverend Jesse Jackson.</i>

1261
01:19:00,055 --> 01:19:02,562
<i>Now what is the state
of the dream, Rev?</i>

1262
01:19:43,282 --> 01:19:48,263
You see, I've always had a special
gift for making people angry.

1263
01:19:48,338 --> 01:19:52,130
"P.O.P." Pissed-Off People.

1264
01:19:52,207 --> 01:19:56,938
Man, sometimes I feel like I
should have a Ph.D. In P.O.P.

1265
01:19:57,018 --> 01:20:00,358
And ain't that a wonderful
expression, y'all? "Pissed off"?

1266
01:20:00,435 --> 01:20:03,073
As opposed to what, man?
"Pissed on"?

1267
01:20:03,468 --> 01:20:04,501
Speaking of which...

1268
01:20:04,932 --> 01:20:07,333
<i>I gotta apologize again.</i>

1269
01:20:07,407 --> 01:20:11,305
<i>Now, I know some of y'all heard
that I lost my mind last night.</i>

1270
01:20:11,381 --> 01:20:14,792
<i>Or as my Aunt Pig would say,
"Boy, you're crazy!"</i>

1271
01:20:14,868 --> 01:20:17,720
<i>And I was, too.
I was, I ain't lying.</i>

1272
01:20:17,795 --> 01:20:21,313
<i>See, I drank about
four gallons of Cold Duck,</i>

1273
01:20:21,386 --> 01:20:24,167
<i>and then I just walked right up on
stage and started pissing, just...</i>

1274
01:20:26,441 --> 01:20:28,557
<i>Didn't even bother grabbing
it, just walked and...</i>

1275
01:20:30,276 --> 01:20:32,463
<i>Started skipping with it.
I said...</i>

1276
01:20:34,250 --> 01:20:37,590
<i>By the time I was through,
the stagehand was drunk.</i>

1277
01:20:40,281 --> 01:20:43,312
<i>And we had a whole row of white
folk too, all the way across.</i>

1278
01:20:43,384 --> 01:20:44,941
<i>Real important people, now.</i>

1279
01:20:45,023 --> 01:20:46,971
<i>We talking about the big shots,
you know, the muckety-mucks.</i>

1280
01:20:47,044 --> 01:20:50,075
<i>Not like you, sir, but...</i>

1281
01:20:51,402 --> 01:20:55,194
<i>I'm telling you, them crackers
dropped dead right on the spot.</i>

1282
01:20:55,272 --> 01:20:58,921
<i>All of them. Looked like a row
of albino dominoes, just...</i>

1283
01:21:01,303 --> 01:21:06,949
<i>Judge say, "Mr. Petey Greene, we
charging you with using your dick</i>

1284
01:21:07,020 --> 01:21:10,668
<i>"as a lethal weapon.
Now how do you plead?"</i>

1285
01:21:10,750 --> 01:21:13,531
<i>I said, "Your Honor! Not
guilty, Your Honor, not guilty!</i>

1286
01:21:13,608 --> 01:21:18,767
<i>"Come on now, I don't want no parts of
this. I use my dick to make love, not war!</i>

1287
01:21:21,174 --> 01:21:23,849
<i>"Shit only look lethal
to white folk. "</i>

1288
01:21:30,448 --> 01:21:32,991
<i>Good evening, Petey. This
is Petey Greene's Washington.</i>

1289
01:21:33,062 --> 01:21:35,427
Okay,
let's try that again.

1290
01:21:35,502 --> 01:21:36,714
For what?

1291
01:21:36,792 --> 01:21:40,345
<i>You said, "Good evening, Petey Greene.
This is Petey Greene's Washington. "</i>

1292
01:21:40,417 --> 01:21:42,710
No, I didn't.
Yeah, you did.

1293
01:21:42,788 --> 01:21:44,559
Dewey, I didn't say...
That's some stupid shit.

1294
01:21:44,636 --> 01:21:46,264
How many times
have we been doing this show?

1295
01:21:46,344 --> 01:21:48,460
I'm gonna say some stupid
shit like that? Come on, man.

1296
01:21:48,540 --> 01:21:50,597
Okay, my mistake. I didn't
say, "Good evening, Petey."

1297
01:21:50,667 --> 01:21:54,007
That's stupid. Okay,
let's try it again. Please.

1298
01:21:54,954 --> 01:21:57,035
Are you ready?
Born so.

1299
01:21:57,116 --> 01:21:58,649
Good evening...

1300
01:22:00,079 --> 01:22:02,337
Okay, let's try it again.

1301
01:22:02,415 --> 01:22:04,293
Let's try it again.
See what you did?

1302
01:22:04,367 --> 01:22:07,005
I fucked up, is what I did!
Yep.

1303
01:22:07,087 --> 01:22:09,309
I gotta stop drinking. God damn! Maybe.

1304
01:22:09,701 --> 01:22:11,364
Good evening, Washington.

1305
01:22:11,445 --> 01:22:14,749
My guest tonight is a pimp that
I wouldn't trust to wash my car,

1306
01:22:14,825 --> 01:22:16,323
but y'all done
elected him city official...

1307
01:22:16,395 --> 01:22:18,023
Cut!

1308
01:22:18,103 --> 01:22:20,052
Jesus Christ, Petey!

1309
01:22:24,726 --> 01:22:25,759
What?

1310
01:22:27,864 --> 01:22:29,111
Freda!

1311
01:22:29,921 --> 01:22:32,667
I love my job!
I love... Where's Petey?

1312
01:22:32,745 --> 01:22:36,263
Where's Petey, huh? Lay it
on me, now! Lay it on me!

1313
01:22:36,336 --> 01:22:39,188
Right on with the right-on!

1314
01:22:39,263 --> 01:22:41,176
You're not gonna
believe what's happening.

1315
01:22:41,251 --> 01:22:43,366
You're not gonna
believe it, man.

1316
01:22:43,447 --> 01:22:45,075
Was it Free Pussy Day
or something?

1317
01:22:45,155 --> 01:22:48,531
You are looking at the baddest
manager on the planet.

1318
01:22:48,607 --> 01:22:51,008
<i>You, my man,
are doing The Tonight Show.</i>

1319
01:22:51,082 --> 01:22:55,159
Next Tuesday, New York City,
live and in living color.

1320
01:22:55,230 --> 01:22:59,545
<i>They had an act cancel
on The Tonight Show, baby!</i>

1321
01:22:59,762 --> 01:23:02,128
You, me, Carson.

1322
01:23:04,504 --> 01:23:06,584
This is it, my man.
Yeah.

1323
01:23:06,665 --> 01:23:10,077
This is that moment that
I've been telling you about.

1324
01:23:10,151 --> 01:23:12,171
Yeah. Yeah!

1325
01:23:13,288 --> 01:23:15,867
Yeah, that's great, man. Yeah.
Yeah?

1326
01:23:16,426 --> 01:23:18,018
"Here's Petey!"

1327
01:23:19,878 --> 01:23:22,695
Yeah.
Yeah. Okay.

1328
01:23:23,572 --> 01:23:24,784
Yeah.
Okay.

1329
01:23:58,121 --> 01:24:01,116
New York, New York, y'all.
Like they say.

1330
01:24:01,188 --> 01:24:04,005
If you make it here...
I'll be a bitch-ass nigga.

1331
01:24:05,372 --> 01:24:07,107
There it is.

1332
01:24:21,652 --> 01:24:23,315
Dewey Hughes?
Yes, sir.

1333
01:24:23,396 --> 01:24:25,452
Fred De Cordova.
I know.

1334
01:24:25,522 --> 01:24:27,328
Glad you could make it
on such short notice.

1335
01:24:27,405 --> 01:24:30,531
If you called us twenty seconds
ago, sir, we would have been here.

1336
01:24:30,611 --> 01:24:32,632
And you must be Petey.
Hey.

1337
01:24:32,703 --> 01:24:33,844
Heard a lot about you.

1338
01:24:33,923 --> 01:24:35,979
Johnny's looking forward
to hearing your routine.

1339
01:24:36,050 --> 01:24:38,071
Well, I just hope
I don't disappoint him.

1340
01:24:38,142 --> 01:24:40,435
Oh, you'll be fine.

1341
01:24:40,513 --> 01:24:42,985
Oh, that's Vernell.
Hi.

1342
01:24:44,347 --> 01:24:48,032
So, dry run's at 10:00,
we're live at 11:30.

1343
01:24:56,618 --> 01:24:58,496
Hi!

1344
01:24:58,571 --> 01:25:00,163
Oh, thank you.

1345
01:25:01,603 --> 01:25:03,231
No, no, please...

1346
01:25:28,377 --> 01:25:30,814
That's
very interesting.

1347
01:25:33,084 --> 01:25:34,641
Oh, no!

1348
01:25:35,768 --> 01:25:37,015
Hey.

1349
01:25:39,323 --> 01:25:42,247
Don't worry. Everyone does it.

1350
01:25:42,322 --> 01:25:44,960
Should've seen Elvis.
Really?

1351
01:25:57,243 --> 01:26:00,095
Picking up some
cable noise from boom 1.

1352
01:26:03,587 --> 01:26:05,643
Yeah.
Yeah.

1353
01:26:06,724 --> 01:26:09,090
So Bette's going to do
two songs, eh? Bette Midler?

1354
01:26:25,166 --> 01:26:27,674
You should see
all the food...

1355
01:26:32,069 --> 01:26:34,090
Would you two relax?

1356
01:26:34,161 --> 01:26:37,881
Carson's gonna give you the
thumbs-up, he's gonna sit you down,

1357
01:26:37,961 --> 01:26:40,778
and then you
are gonna be a star.

1358
01:26:40,854 --> 01:26:44,467
Yeah, well, I don't know
about that, dude.

1359
01:26:44,549 --> 01:26:47,854
I don't know if I'm ready, is
what I'm trying to tell you.

1360
01:26:47,931 --> 01:26:52,008
<i>Bette Midler to the stage,
please. Bette Midler to the stage.</i>

1361
01:26:52,812 --> 01:26:54,273
You're ready.

1362
01:26:54,520 --> 01:26:56,576
And in exactly 30 minutes,

1363
01:26:56,646 --> 01:26:59,713
this whole country is gonna
know what I already know.

1364
01:26:59,784 --> 01:27:04,800
That Petey Greene is
the baddest comic in America.

1365
01:27:05,396 --> 01:27:08,249
Just keep it real,
like you do,

1366
01:27:09,894 --> 01:27:11,950
you'll be fine.

1367
01:27:13,171 --> 01:27:14,561
Excuse me.
Yes, sir?

1368
01:27:14,635 --> 01:27:17,178
Where's the green room? Oh,
sure thing, sir. Just follow me.

1369
01:27:17,250 --> 01:27:20,173
It's only New York, baby.
Just a suburb of P-Town.

1370
01:27:21,537 --> 01:27:22,999
Relax!

1371
01:27:34,228 --> 01:27:36,485
Over here, to your left.
Thank you.

1372
01:27:36,563 --> 01:27:38,298
Dewey!
Yeah?

1373
01:27:38,375 --> 01:27:40,705
You have to get him
out of this, man.

1374
01:27:40,782 --> 01:27:43,742
What? Are you nuts?
Listen to me, Dewey.

1375
01:27:44,372 --> 01:27:48,614
I know that man. Hell, you know that
man. And I know you saw that look.

1376
01:27:48,695 --> 01:27:51,441
I didn't see shit.
I saw nerves.

1377
01:27:51,519 --> 01:27:54,550
Dewey, baby. I know
how important this is to you.

1378
01:27:54,621 --> 01:27:56,499
He does, too! That's the
only reason why he's here!

1379
01:27:56,574 --> 01:28:00,187
To me? It has nothing to do
with me. Bullshit, Vernell.

1380
01:28:00,269 --> 01:28:06,296
Bullshit! I mean, Cosby, Gregory,
Pryor, they've all been on that stage.

1381
01:28:06,370 --> 01:28:09,852
<i>What comic in the world doesn't
want to be on The Tonight Show?</i>

1382
01:28:09,925 --> 01:28:11,280
You see, he ain't a comic.

1383
01:28:11,355 --> 01:28:13,993
He ain't a comic, he ain't
a television personality,

1384
01:28:14,074 --> 01:28:15,702
he ain't a civic leader!

nigga from DC who...

1386
01:28:23,173 --> 01:28:26,240
He's just a regular-ass nigga
from DC who likes to run his mouth.

1387
01:28:26,311 --> 01:28:29,092
And for some reason,
people respond! Vernell?

1388
01:28:29,169 --> 01:28:32,367
Vernell, you're wrong, okay?

1389
01:28:34,120 --> 01:28:36,105
Look where we are.

1390
01:28:36,525 --> 01:28:37,843
Look where we are.

1391
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:42,484
He doesn't want to be here,
Dewey. I can see it in his eyes.

1392
01:28:43,322 --> 01:28:46,840
Just keep an eye on him.

1393
01:28:46,913 --> 01:28:49,873
Make sure he doesn't leave
that room. Okay?

1394

All righty,
we're back.

1419
01:31:36,027 --> 01:31:40,520
Now, ladies and gentlemen, from
Washington, DC, Petey Greene.

1420
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:07,540
Y'all gonna have to forgive me
if I'm a little nervous,

1421
01:32:07,611 --> 01:32:11,058
I just ain't never been in front
of this many white folk before.

1422
01:32:12,702 --> 01:32:16,219
I know my manager, Dewey, is backstage
right now about to have a heart attack,

1423
01:32:16,292 --> 01:32:22,282
saying, "Oh Lord, please don't let this
fool go out here and say something crazy."

1424
01:32:22,358 --> 01:32:25,389
But he knows
I always speak the truth.

1425
01:32:27,448 --> 01:32:28,481
Yeah.

1426
01:32:34,629 --> 01:32:36,435
Well, the truth is,

1427
01:32:36,721 --> 01:32:38,836
I'm just an ex-con, y'all.

1428
01:32:40,137 --> 01:32:42,193
And the people that live
in the world that I come from,

1429
01:32:42,264 --> 01:32:44,939
well, most of them
can't even afford TVs.

1430
01:32:45,018 --> 01:32:47,800
They listen to me
on the radio, and they do that

1431
01:32:48,434 --> 01:32:50,585
because I keeps it real.

1432
01:32:52,548 --> 01:32:54,628
When they out there laughing,

1433
01:32:54,709 --> 01:32:57,561
I know they laughing
with me, not at me.

1434
01:33:04,819 --> 01:33:08,017
But I look out here at y'all,

1435
01:33:08,096 --> 01:33:12,898
and all I see a room full of white
folk waiting to hear some nigger jokes.

1436
01:33:16,951 --> 01:33:19,803
I ain't got nothing
to say to you people.

1437
01:33:20,298 --> 01:33:22,628
Y'all ain't ready for P-Town.

1438
01:33:25,178 --> 01:33:26,735
Sorry, Johnny.

1439
01:33:43,167 --> 01:33:45,187
I was being real, Dewey.

1440
01:33:47,490 --> 01:33:48,596
You motherfucker!

1441
01:33:48,675 --> 01:33:49,922
No! Dewey!

1442
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:53,340
Fuck you, man! Fuck you!

1443
01:33:59,273 --> 01:34:01,044
What the fuck you doing?

1444
01:34:01,121 --> 01:34:02,618
Fuck you, man!
Fuck you!

1445
01:34:07,151 --> 01:34:10,598
You know, as far as jails
go, this one ain't too bad.

1446
01:34:36,261 --> 01:34:38,139
Dewey, man, I'm sorry, man.

1447
01:34:38,213 --> 01:34:40,650
Get the fuck
away from me, man.

1448
01:34:47,172 --> 01:34:51,214
Look here. I ain't never
asked for this shit.

1449
01:34:53,168 --> 01:34:57,484
All I ever wanted to do was
my little thing on the radio.

1450
01:34:57,562 --> 01:35:01,841
<i>All this other shit, this
Tonight Show, come on, man.</i>

1451
01:35:01,919 --> 01:35:03,451
That ain't me.

1452
01:35:04,289 --> 01:35:06,370
I tried to tell you that.

1453
01:35:09,135 --> 01:35:10,454

1454
01:35:11,889 --> 01:35:13,351

1455
01:35:16,352 --> 01:35:17,670
was yours.

1456
01:35:22,522 --> 01:35:24,258
I could've

1457
01:35:25,904 --> 01:35:28,055
taken you right to the top.

1458
01:35:30,401 --> 01:35:32,552
But you just fucked it up.

1459
01:35:35,456 --> 01:35:37,678
You're nothing but a con.

1460
01:35:41,034 --> 01:35:44,100
That's all you'll ever be,
just like Milo.

1461
01:35:45,950 --> 01:35:49,147
Just another no-good,

1462
01:35:50,586 --> 01:35:52,083
low-life

1463
01:35:54,525 --> 01:35:55,631
con.

1464
01:35:56,234 --> 01:35:58,385
I ain't your brother, man.

1465
01:35:59,755 --> 01:36:02,857
I also ain't the one
got us thrown in here tonight.

1466
01:36:02,927 --> 01:36:04,483
That was you.

1467
01:36:05,751 --> 01:36:07,379
So if I'm a con,

1468
01:36:08,435 --> 01:36:10,312
baby, you a con, too.

1469
01:36:13,873 --> 01:36:17,426
You two. You got bailed.

1470
01:36:41,170 --> 01:36:43,677
Quit trying to change me,
Dewey.

1471
01:36:54,940 --> 01:36:57,270

"you out of your mind."

1488
01:39:10,691 --> 01:39:12,391
Congratulations.

<i>I'm Dewey Hughes, rocking

1496
01:39:36,314 --> 01:39:39,619

1497
01:39:39,696 --> 01:39:40,979

<i>Morning, everybody.</i>

1504
01:40:00,090 --> 01:40:03,287
Hey, congratulations
on your show, there, Dewey.

1505
01:40:03,367 --> 01:40:05,102
Man, I gotta tell you,
I never would've believed it,

1506
01:40:05,250 --> 01:40:08,376
<i>but you turned out to be
one hell of a DJ, man.</i>

1507
01:40:10,653 --> 01:40:12,911
What you in the mood for,
Petey?

1508
01:40:16,928 --> 01:40:20,791
Why don't you play me
some of that old Sly Stone?

1509
01:40:20,867 --> 01:40:23,233
<i>If You Want Me To Stay.</i>

1510
01:40:30,141 --> 01:40:31,424
Hung up.

1511
01:40:39,239 --> 01:40:40,939
It's all right.

1512
01:40:50,918 --> 01:40:53,628
What's your job, man?
What's your job, man?

1513
01:40:53,706 --> 01:40:55,477
I'm sorry, man.
Screen the calls!

1514
01:40:55,555 --> 01:40:57,670
Shut up! Screen the calls!

1515
01:40:57,925 --> 01:40:58,959
God.

1516
01:41:22,259 --> 01:41:23,720
One minute.

1517
01:41:34,460 --> 01:41:36,088
How much is it?

1518
01:41:37,493 --> 01:41:41,011
Priceless,
but the pizza's on me.

1519
01:41:41,084 --> 01:41:44,246
I ran into
the delivery guy in the hall.

1520
01:41:46,557 --> 01:41:47,769
Nice!

1521
01:41:50,567 --> 01:41:53,383
So I hear you're
the man up in here now.

1522
01:41:55,481 --> 01:41:57,323
<i>Cathy Show was a hit.</i>

1523
01:41:58,375 --> 01:41:59,968
I bought the station.

1524
01:42:00,048 --> 01:42:01,545
Congratulations.

1525
01:42:02,349 --> 01:42:05,510
Is that enough milk?
Oh, that's fine, honey.

1526
01:42:07,230 --> 01:42:08,966
To your success.

1527
01:42:23,371 --> 01:42:26,367
Aren't you gonna
ask me how he is?

1528
01:42:26,439 --> 01:42:28,946
How is he?
Come on, Dewey.

1529
01:42:29,018 --> 01:42:33,334
He helped you build this
place. You can say his name.

1530
01:42:34,492 --> 01:42:35,954
How's Petey?

1531
01:42:37,141 --> 01:42:38,733
Well, you know,

1532
01:42:39,860 --> 01:42:43,759
all those years of hard
living'll catch up to you one day.

1533
01:42:47,390 --> 01:42:49,126
His time is tight.

1534
01:42:51,574 --> 01:42:53,130
He misses you.

1535
01:43:11,306 --> 01:43:13,077
You see this show?

1536
01:43:15,175 --> 01:43:19,834
My whole fucking life
is this show.

1537
01:43:19,916 --> 01:43:24,028
I learned to walk,
talk and dress

1538
01:43:25,703 --> 01:43:27,819
<i>watching The Tonight Show.</i>

1539
01:43:28,423 --> 01:43:29,955
I can tell.

1540
01:43:32,571 --> 01:43:37,788
It showed me that there was a world
far away from the Anacostia projects.

1541
01:43:41,461 --> 01:43:43,791
He reminds me of my brothers.

1542
01:43:44,668 --> 01:43:46,962
Loud-ass shit-talkers.

1543
01:43:48,015 --> 01:43:50,975
Funny as hell.
Always had me cracking up.

1544
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,056
Milo was the funniest.

1545
01:43:58,160 --> 01:43:59,823
He was my hero.

1546
01:44:01,471 --> 01:44:05,119
He could say anything, do
anything. He could've been a...

1547
01:44:18,344 --> 01:44:21,862
Well, he's at Morgan's
every Tuesday night,

1548
01:44:21,935 --> 01:44:25,037
waiting for somebody
to give him a good game.

1549
01:44:26,153 --> 01:44:28,066
Thanks for the drink.

1550
01:44:35,949 --> 01:44:37,827
I love you, Dewey.

1551
01:44:39,749 --> 01:44:42,007
You take care
of yourself, okay?

1552
01:45:26,847 --> 01:45:28,023
Tails.

1553
01:45:48,810 --> 01:45:52,150
So you the new
Blue Blazes, huh, man?

1554
01:45:54,597 --> 01:45:56,153
That's right.

1555
01:45:57,316 --> 01:46:03,414
You sure did it, Dewey. Took that
little old two-bit radio station

1556
01:46:05,579 --> 01:46:08,289
and turned it into
a powerhouse, man.

1557
01:46:26,496 --> 01:46:29,039
I couldn't have done it
without you.

1558
01:46:29,808 --> 01:46:30,841
No.

1559
01:46:31,899 --> 01:46:34,681
I could've never did
that shit you did.

1560
01:46:35,768 --> 01:46:37,610
Like you said, Dew,

1561
01:46:38,871 --> 01:46:44,089
I needed you to do all the things
that I was too afraid to do.

1562
01:47:11,536 --> 01:47:13,687
What about the other part?

1563
01:47:13,768 --> 01:47:15,468
What other part?

1564
01:47:19,380 --> 01:47:20,699
The part

1565
01:47:22,518 --> 01:47:24,811
when I said that I need you

1566
01:47:26,771 --> 01:47:29,897
to say all the things
that I'm afraid to say.

1567
01:47:31,756 --> 01:47:33,039
Oh, that part.

1568
01:47:43,400 --> 01:47:44,719
Not now.

1569
01:47:52,534 --> 01:47:54,376
Well, the truth is,

1570
01:47:55,392 --> 01:47:57,936
you ain't getting
no younger, man.

1571
01:47:59,261 --> 01:48:04,171
So I decided I'm gonna
cut you some slack.

1572
01:48:04,247 --> 01:48:06,232
Go on and forgive you.

1573
01:48:08,117 --> 01:48:09,294
Forgive me.

1574
01:48:16,484 --> 01:48:18,920
I love you
like a brother, man.

1575
01:48:21,573 --> 01:48:23,594
I know you love me, too.

1576
01:48:25,303 --> 01:48:27,669
Now, you too stubborn
to say it,

1577
01:48:28,894 --> 01:48:31,331
but I think you miss
old Petey Greene.

1578
01:48:33,810 --> 01:48:36,282
So I'm gonna give you
one last shot.

1579
01:48:45,140 --> 01:48:46,637
That's deep.

1580
01:48:49,219 --> 01:48:51,239
Yeah it was, wasn't it?

1581
01:48:53,645 --> 01:48:55,523
I might put that
in a card someday.

1582
01:49:04,069 --> 01:49:05,805
Good shot, Petey.

1583
01:49:24,882 --> 01:49:28,258
Everybody come back to the shop
with their eyes fucked up...

1584
01:49:29,832 --> 01:49:31,151
Stop it!

1585
01:49:41,964 --> 01:49:47,504
<i>I ain't nothing, man, I ain't
nothing but a con and a thief.</i>

1586
01:49:47,577 --> 01:49:50,252
<i>So I ain't up here trying
to be nobody's preacher.</i>

1587
01:49:50,331 --> 01:49:54,717
<i>I'm just trying to tell the truth
to y'all, like I promised I would.</i>

1588
01:50:01,242 --> 01:50:05,485
<i>Petey liked to say
that he was just a con.</i>

1589
01:50:05,879 --> 01:50:08,137
<i>Telling it like it is.</i>

1590
01:50:09,888 --> 01:50:12,039
<i>But he was more than that.</i>

1591
01:50:17,592 --> 01:50:20,588
<i>He said the things
that we were afraid to say.</i>

1592
01:50:22,752 --> 01:50:24,345
I'm sorry, man.

1593
01:50:32,408 --> 01:50:35,261
<i>He was the bravest man
that I ever met.</i>

1594
01:50:37,742 --> 01:50:40,594
<i>He was, and still is,
everything I'm not.</i>

1595
01:50:44,122 --> 01:50:45,822
<i>And that's why I love him.</i>

1596
01:50:45,900 --> 01:50:47,433
Yeah.

1597
01:50:51,722 --> 01:50:54,265
<i>So, in the words
of my best friend,</i>

1598
01:50:57,649 --> 01:51:00,050
<i>"That's all we got.
Yeah!</i>

1599
01:51:00,124 --> 01:51:02,037
<i>"There ain't no more.
That's right!</i>

1600
01:51:02,111 --> 01:51:04,060
<i>"Time is tight.</i>

1601
01:51:04,133 --> 01:51:06,771
<i>"It's the end of the show.</i>

1602
01:51:06,851 --> 01:51:10,893
<i>"So grab your head
and make a fist. "</i>

1603
01:51:11,524 --> 01:51:14,340
<i>"Listen to me
and remember this. "</i>

1604
01:51:14,417 --> 01:51:15,807
...and remember this.

1605
01:51:15,880 --> 01:51:19,327
I tell it to the hot,
I tell it to the cold.

1606
01:51:19,401 --> 01:51:23,122
I tell it to the young,
I tell it to the old.

1607
01:51:23,201 --> 01:51:26,125
Don't want no laughing,
don't want no crying.

1608
01:51:26,200 --> 01:51:29,302
<i>And most of all, no
signifying. "...no signifying!"</i>

1609
01:51:29,895 --> 01:51:33,937
<i>This is Petey Greene's
Washington, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

1610
01:51:34,009 --> 01:51:35,601
<i>This is P-Town!</i>

1611
01:51:35,683 --> 01:51:39,236
Petey! Petey!
Petey! Petey!

1612
01:51:39,308 --> 01:51:43,206
Petey! Petey! Petey! Petey!

1613
01:51:49,627 --> 01:51:50,839
<i>Be cool, y'all.</i>

1614
01:52:40,977 --> 01:52:42,891
<i>Wake up, God damn it!</i>

1615
01:54:06,528 --> 01:54:08,513
<i>Shirley Chisholm
for President, everybody!</i>

1616
01:54:08,585 --> 01:54:11,188
<i>Vote Shirley Chisholm
for President, 1972!</i>

1617
01:56:09,275 --> 01:56:12,472
<i>Why do you think
they send our boys off to war?</i>

1618
01:58:28,547 --> 01:58:32,268
<i>Look here. I ain't never
asked for this shit.</i>
