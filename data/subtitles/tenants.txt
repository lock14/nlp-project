The Tenants



Rah Rah Rah, Each shot kills one.



Bam. Bye.



Rah Rah Rah, Each shot kills one.



Bam. Bye.



Rah Rah Rah, Each shot kills one.



Bam. Bye.



Rah Rah Rah, Each shot kills one.



- Bam. Bye.
- I won!



Is already midnight?



How did you get here?



Who were you with
until this hour, Cristina?



- Get out of here, Hugo.
- I'm your husband, Cristina.



You're nothing, anymore,
Do you understand? Nothing!



Today you will take.



Let me go!



Each life is a life, right?



You think that you can help
but instead you just get in the way.



Just the other day I told her
that she should...



be firmer, take better
care of her kids.



It only made it worse.



He got home in a rage,
like a mad dog.



I want to eat real food,
not 3 minute soup!



And Teresinha responded,
right?



To eat what?
You don't work and want to eat?



He beat her, he beat
the son for trying to intervene.



Didn't you hear
the yelling today?



Yeah.



Did Nanda read her
book for school?



She said she did. But it's
the usual battle, as you know.



She hasn't done her
homework for today yet.



Come and eat, honey.
It's on the table.



Go ahead, dear,
Tell me.



- Not now, dad.
- Yes, now, Nanda.



You can eat slowly, because



you're not going to
watch a soap opera today.



So there's no reason to rush.



- But dad...
- No, Nando. That's that.



You have to do your
homework first.



Ok and the book?
Tell me.



Oh, dad. The story is about some
bad guys that arrive in a quiet town



and mess it all up. In the end they
all die and everyone is happy.



And why were they bad?



They are bad cause
the book wanted...



them to be bad. Because
they aren't good.



And because they were born bad guys.



I got it.
The book does say, is that it?



It's a story like that.
The book is stupid.



Mr. Dimas!



Oo Oo, Mr. Dimas!



Prick, isn't there anyone
here in this shit?



Mr. Dimas!



- Oo, Mr. Dimas!
- Right here.



- She said you wouldn't come till tomorrow.
- Today was better.



Just take care of this, quick.



Right?



You can unload.



- Go, man!
- Unload it there, Juvenal.



Mom, they've got a new pick-up with
fog lights and dark glass.



Diogo, didn't you tell me
that you were going to bed?



Go on.



Brush your teeth first.



Do they look like good people?



We'll see.



Are they Consuelo's folk?



The house at the back is hers,
isn't it?



Poor Mr. Dimas,
you know?



He's got to have these people he doesn't
even know where they come from, in his home.



Do that or sell out,
right?



That's what Consuelo wants. To sell.
So she can ruin Mr. Dimas' life even more.



What an awful lady.



After Mr. Dimas retired,
it got worse.



Yeah...



No woman of a
weak man is good, mark my word.



Women... there are the good ones...



and the really bad ones.



Fuckin' bitch!



But you really are a complete
idiot, aren't you, purse snatcher.



Hey, you. I don't think
the stuff broke.



Hey, you, kid. Go fetch more good water for
the old man, cause this has turned to mud.



Do one thing right.



- Go, urchin!
- Go, urchin!



Some criminals threw Molotov cocktails
in a crowded bus.



A two-year-old child got burned
on the face and arms.



At rush hour, 3 men
got on like passengers



and threw some flammable
liquid and set fire.



- Everyone on the street is a suspect.
- Lift your shirt.



Lift up your shirt.



The police found the body of that



eight-year-old girl,
Maria Elisângela Aparecida



she'd been missing for 2 days.



Maria Elisângela, eight years old,
you heard right- 8 years old.



Was raped by 3 men,
stabbed and strangled.



Back to you, Datena.



The body was found on the
banks of the reservoir of



Mangaratiba, 8 kilometers
from the local of the kidnapping.



Maria Elisângela's mother couldn't handle
the news and had to be sedated.



Just for you to understand, the girl was
identified by the older sister.



My daughter...



The sister has no doubt.
The body that was found



is little Maria Elisângela Aparecida's.



Immaculate body,
a pure being...



an angel... defiled, bruised, torn
in that bag there, do you see



there's a body. The body of
a little girl.



So I can't say any more.
You go crazy with these things.



What do you want?



Shut up, son of a bitch.
Shut up.



- You screwed prick.
- Where's my money?



My part.



Hey, let's wake up?
Come on?



Hey, little princess,
let's wake up!



- Diogo, eat your bread.
- I'm sleepy.



Wake up!



Wake up, Maria Bonita.
Get up and make breakfast.



The sun is shining.



And the police are
already ready.



No, and that's it. Iarinha.



Ouch, mom,
don't pull so hard.



Cock-ca-doodle-doo!



He went far away.



- Hey, Francisco. What's up?
- Hey, brother.



- Let's go?
- Let's go.



Did you see the guys
who arrived there?



I was on duty. They must have
arrived before that.



It was about nine.
3 guys.



Teens?



Yeah, young
Twenty some at the most.



Look Valter. I think you
should stop studying



at night and spend more
time with your family.



Look, Francisco, you kept on
and got your nursing diploma.



I got it, but so what?



To shift an item from
one side of the equation



to the other, you have
to change the sign.



If it's positive, it'll be negative.
If it's negative, it'll be positive.



So... here...



If 'X' plus 4 equals 12.



Then X equals 12 minus 4.



Why? Because this 4 was positive here,
it moved and turned negative. Understand?



So 'X' equals 8.



Look, it's easy.



Valter? You who got the
equation right,



don't you want to come up here
and make... it's even simpler.



- Excuse me, professor.
- Of course.



I need to tell the students
something.



- Good evening.
- Good evening.



Last Tuesday many of you
didn't come to school,



due to the rumors about curfew,
gang attacks.



Well... the school was open
and I want to tell



you that it will always be
open during school hours.



Those who decide not to come
will assume the consequences.



You'll be marked absent and
you won't have a second chance on tests.



We're not deciding for you.



Oh really? So we're going to school
and 'bang'



and someone is shot
here at the door, man.



By the police or by bandits.
And then?



What are you doing to do about it, huh?
Will you pay for the burial?



Each one has his choice.
You are adults.



Our obligation is to be here
waiting for the students.



And our obligation?



And ours, man, what is it, buddy?
It's to stay alive, you get my drift?



Before and after school,
you get it?



Positive, negative, positive.
Isn't that it, big man?



It's your decision.



The decision is those who have power.



Good night, everyone. Good work.
Thank you, professor.



Evandro, if you keep banging your head
against the wall, it'll turn bad for you.



That's it, 'prof'. It's always us who
gets the raw deal in the end, man. You dig?



That's the law. She comes here and talks
about options, man? Damn it, man!



Get out of my way,
asshole prick.



Well, get a look at this here.



Another shot!



The kid was hit!
The kid was hit!



And he keeps running.



He already was hurt and there
is the shot that killed him.



- Oh my God, look at it.
- Barbarous.



Today Fernanda came home from
school all happy.



The teacher wrote a note in her notebook
praising her for her good work.



You should have seen how happy
she was, Valter.



You know, with that cuddly way that she



that she has of turning her little head
to the side and laughing.



She got home and showed me
the notebook and said:



Mom, look at what the teacher
wrote to me.



And those renters there?



They slept the whole day.



They hung around there. Woke up late,
sat around and drank beer, laughing.



Listening to music.



I don't think they work.



The clothes.



Uh, oh.



The neighborhood.
The crazy ones have arrived.



Hey, what's up,
neighborhood.



Shut up, animal.



- Well!
- Hang on.



Go!



You prick, man.
It's so dark.



I can't get the lock in the key,
damn it.



Get on the other side,
git.



Give me it.



Wow, would you?



Are you underestimating my old
Benedito. War veteran, here.



I must admit that this time,
even I thought he wouldn't



be able to do it. You didn't tell how
big the problem was, did you, damn it.



Of course not,
I'm not stupid.



- My princess, give your dad a kiss.
- Hi, dad.



- Dad, look at our dance.
- Let me see.



- That's great!
- Come dance.



- Me? Oh, not me, honey.
- Come on.



How do you do it?



Oh, no, can't do that.



- Oh, Mr. Dimas.
- How are you?



A suit in this heat?



Man, I think I'm
getting sick.



It's lack of sleep. Consuelo's hoodlums
don't give me a moment's rest.



Everyone knows that, right,
Mr. Dimas.



The house is also mine.



This isn't right.



I went to talk to them.
I was real polite and all.



They answered me like they did,
pushing me and cussing me out.



I hate when people
don't show any respect.



Then when one dies with a bullet
in his forehead, they'll wonder why.



Valter, I'm going get a piece of metal
to loosen up this knot.



I called Consuelo to complain.



Do you know what she said?



If that's the problem,
then we'll sell the house



and each one will have
their part of the money.



She'd do it, too.



That's not the way to
do things.



You are so right, Mr. Dimas.
It's all wrong.



We've got to stifle everything
that's wrong, you know, Mr. Dimas.



But what can you do?
There are 3 of them.



It's better if you think
of another idea.



I'm going to get some sleep,
see if I can get caught up.



Fernanda!



Come here, honey.



They still haven't found the person
who killed that girl.



The one whose body
was thrown in the reservoir.



She wasn't from around here.



They just put her body there.



Right here next to us, Valter.



Can you imagine, 8 years old,
being raped by 3 men.



Jesus, Mary and Joseph.



I think the number of bad people is
increasing in this world.



That's why I don't let Diogo go
play near the dam.



Too close to the shanty town.



They're saying that the folks
next door came from there...



A new blouse, Iara?



No!



I haven't worn it for
a long time.



Do you like it?



It's pretty.



Hello? Did you freeze?
Die?



The boss wants
to talk to you.



Listen up.
Are you sick?



No, Zé. Everything's fine.



So wake up then, ok?



You got to work,
right?



If you don't, the boss
will get mad. Right?



Work!



Put some muscle into it, man,
Put some muscle into it.



God helps those who get up early.



It's every man for himself, man.
Every man for himself.



Bartolomeu, the short guy,
with the mustache, you know?



The guy from the canteen.
Do you know who he is?



A guy like us.



Work, has a woman, kid...
all that shit. Normal.



A drug dealer, lord of the
territory, that's what they say,



started going to his house for lunch.
Went in, sat down and ate.



Bartolomeu, didn't say a word, right?
The guy was the boss of the piece.



One day he warned he'd 'do' his
wife. He warned him.



Bartolomeu when to talk
to a policeman he knew.



The guy said he couldn't
do anything.



He couldn't arrest a no-good-doer because
he was going to do someone's wife.



He gave him a gun. A 12 caliber sawed off
shotgun and said:



Go kill the guy.
Then we'll take care of things.



We can't go around killing people.
You've got to do that.



He went and killed him.
Bartolomeu.



He killed the guy.



The bandit was
plastered to the wall.



Dad, can we go buy gum close
to Ms. Rita's bar?



Ms. Rita's, son?
- And the busy street?



We'll cross at the light.



OK, go ahead.



Be careful, Diogo.
Look before you cross.



Tomé.



Jacó.



Hey, neighbor,
what year is this car?



It's an '85.



Yeah...



Fabricio is ticked off with
the people who moved in there.



It's hard to take
these lazy folks.



The guy comes over, Iara,
without saying good morning.



"What year is the car"?



I don't even know the guy.



Not even, 'good morning.'



Who does this guy think he is?



We don't know who they are.



I've got a wife and kid...



I've got a wife and kid...



A wife at home, alone...



Iara, I don't want you to
go around talking



about the neighbors,
with your brother, understand?



Maybe everyone's right.
Maybe they're all criminals.



See something, no one sees anything, right?
Maybe they're right.



That's about it.



That's all there is.
To each his own.



Just don't bring
problems home, OK?



That's how it is.



That's what the walls are for, Iara.
Each one on their own side.



But, Mr. Dimas?



He's ill-tempered, but old.
Weak, you know.



That's it? That's all?
Each one on his own side?



Mr. Dimas has been our
neighbor for how many years?



And this group of kids
has nothing to lose, right?



Fabricio is getting his friends to
set up something for those 3 there.



Set up what, Iara?



Set up. Set up what...
You don't have to set up anything, Iara.



Your brother is a dwarf chicken,
he'll bring us trouble.



He does the dirty work and
we have to face the neighbors here.



Set up what?



Oh, Diogo,
Come here, boy.



What happened?



What is this!



Did you fall?



Yeah, near Ms. Rita's bar.



Haven't I told you that you're only supposed
to play here in front of the gate?



- I'm going to ground you, Diogo.
- Wait, Iara. Calm down.



I'm the one who let him go
and then he could have



fallen right here,
or anywhere.



Valter, for goodness sakes,
it's dangerous.



Oh, Iara. Now everything
is dangerous.



The boy goes around the block and
now it's dangerous.



What kind of a life is that?



Go get Fernanda, then.
I'll take care of him here.



- Did you look before crossing, Diogo?
- Yeah, dad. The light was red.



But a car ran the red light and
almost hit me.



Diogo, I think it's better if you
listen to your mother, do you hear me?



Wait until you grow up a bit more,
until then play close to here.



Come on.



Finished.



Look at that, would you?



Good boy, good boy
Do it, do it.



Dad, Dad, today's the game.
You promised to take me.



Wait just a bit more, son.



Uncle Fabricio is there. If you don't want
to take me, he said he would.



No, I'll take you,
Diogo.



They make noise
all night long.



You can't get any sleep.



I'd like to move away from here.



But I can't tell Valter, right?



Remember? That story when



he came here with his
family and sisters.



Building all of this,
with his dad.



Brick by brick.



I can get some rest
after the kids go to school.



But he... poor thing.



I'm the one who insisted that
he go back to school, Fabricio.



I thought it was important that we
wanted to improve our lives.



Give a good example to the kids.



Someone has to
do something, Fabricio.



After these folk came here,
you know?



It's downright scary.



Scary, no.
It's revolting, that's it.



These guys are nothing, Iara.



Relax, we'll take care of them.



- Oh, Valter!
- Good morning.



Good morning.



Sit down. Eat your breakfast, in peace,
I'll take the boy.



Later you can go there.



It's over near the dam.



After that story about the
girl being raped...



And also it's really close
to the shanty town.



No one is going to be stupid enough
to mess around with folks from here, Iara.



What a beauty...



What you want, man?



- What?
- Go ahead.



Go.



- Go ahead, pest.
- Go, ahead, pest



Sucker.



Hello... Sucker.
Go fuck.



What an asshole, that pest.



Dioguinho, you're not going out
anymore on the street now, son.



It's getting late.



Take a shower and then
come and watch TVwith us.



What's wrong, Diogo?



I said you're not going out.
And you're not going out.



Go take a shower, move. I don't want
any dirty kids on the sofa.



But dad, I'm not going
to play on the street.



I'm going to play
video games at Toninho's house.



I said what I said, Diogo.
I'll not repeat it.



But it's not even 7 o'clock yet.



- Tomorrow's Sunday, I don't have class.
- Don't make me mad, Diogo.



What's this - talking
back to your father?



I don't want a disobedient boy
in this house, you understand?



Did he get into trouble at the game?



No.



It's just that the atmosphere outside
isn't good, Iara.



I don't want anyone from here
just wandering around.



...carcasses in flames.
That was how the night went on



in the metropolitan region of Sao Paulo
and in the interior of the state.



For the second day in a
row, organized crime is



showing its strength
against the government.



In twelve hours of attacks,
30 buses have been destroyed.



It wasn't until the end of the morning, that
the government presented an action plan.



Armed and plain clothes policemen will
be in



all the main bus stations and
on buses in the capital.



In São Paulo a grenade destroyed
the front of the city council building.



On the south side, the entrance
to the subway was machine gunned.



People in Sao Paulo were left without
transport and with no patience.



Everything OK?



The kids only just fell asleep.



Now it's like this.



They bring women here.
Have parties at home.



Hold this shit and learn,
old man.



- Relax, prick.
- What's going down, man.



Shut up!



- Hey, son of a bitch.
- Wait, damn it.



And now?
And now?



Stop right there. Stop it.
Stop playing with this shit.



It breaks my heart, Valter.



What's wrong?



What? Didn't you see how
they're dressed?



In a bit they'II... what? Start making out
in front of my kids.



They are in their home.



And the noise, Valter.



You don't understand.



How can I let my daughter hear
this crap?



Those girls, there, Valter.



This is an insult.



Tomorrow's a work day.



This rowdiness started before 5 PM.



We hear what shouldn't
even exist.



I don't want my daughter's head
full of this crap.



This... this...



They're different from us.



We didn't sacrifice so much to
raise our kids like this?!



I've thought about leaving.
Taking the kids away from this.



Take them to my dad's house.
It's safer there.



I'm thinking about teaching Fernanda
how to crochet.



At her age, I already was pretty
good at it.



What's your brother doing here, Iara?



- I don't know, Valter.
- Did you call him.



- Yeah.
- To talk about what?



About the shameful things that go on
next door.



I wanted to take the kids to my dad's house.
I called Fabricio to go with me.



Then I thought that you
would be mad.



I was really upset at the time,
Valter.



Oh, Iara.
I stay out all day long.



I don't see what goes on.



Did these people talk to you?



Hum, Iara?
Did they try to break in here?



No.



Think, ok? Iara?



You must reason. You can't go
getting upset, now.



You have to keep thinking all the time.
And think right.



Come here, please, Fabricio.
What's going on?



They're asking for trouble.
Dinho's sister is inside.



This is not your problem.
You don't even live on this street, man!



Iara called me.



She called you, but the one who takes
care of my family is me, OK, Fabricio?



Valter, here's the scoop.



We tried to get them away from here.
It didn't work.



So, we'll get them here.



Get what, man?
Get what?



Do you have a gun to 'get'
something?



Afterwards, it's your sister who will be
here in big trouble with these bandits.



Would you just stop this?
Stop this, you bunch of kids.



Stop it, damn it!



Is this the time for kids to
be on the streets?



Go home.
Stop this...



Fuckin' bitch!



Fuckin' bitch! Kid
Go home right now, damn you.



Fuckin' bitch!



What is all this about, neighbor?



The confusion is the noise.



The confusion...



is the confusion.



I don't know you, my friend.
You also don't know me.



It's just that we only
need a bit of silence.



It's nearly 11 o'clock.
Damn it.



The street isn't yours.



It's not just yours,
no!



Let's everyone go to sleep.



Hey, guys.



Turn down the music.
Turn the volume down.



Turn down the music. Our little friend isn't
feeling well. No, he isn't. Are you ill?



Yeah, it's really time to go to sleep.



Right?



Good night.



Take care.
Good night.



Who threw the rock, mom?
Who was it?



Diogo, eat your bread and
stop talking with your mouth full.



Dad took on the bandits, Diogo.
That's what happened, didn't it mom?



Someone had to do something.
And you father went and did it.



All alone?
What about Uncle Fabricio?



You can't be afraid of
dirty looks.



But did he win?



Diogo, you've got food all over.
Pay attention.



Bye.



Next time use a helmet,
man.



Clown!



Zé?



I've been thinking...



If I were registered, as an
official employee.



Would that be bad for you?



What are you saying?



You know, legally registered
employee.



Oh, yeah...
it's really bad for me.



It just gets in the way and
doesn't help anyone.



I was just thinking about...



about the security.



Security?



Truth is external,



the war has already begun
inside us.



Peace is too short a word
to have any effect.



The thought of having wings
doesn't make me feel good any more.



I want to crawl.



Well thought out books are
prostitutes, well-paid by vanity.



The difference from
those who are mediocre



is that they know how
to capitalize on chaos.



God woke me up early today



and told me to keep my mouth shut.



As always in the world,
stubbornness gives birth to good sense.



Between noise and a
light rain, the thing that



makes the least sense
is to look at the truth.



Although I wanted to stop, now I know
that you can't stop blood.



Anyone have anything to say?



He's one of those for
whom killing is normal, right?



- It's part of life.
- What are you saying, brother.



You don't understand a thing, man.



Ferréz is talking about life as it is,
brother. The real deal.



Just because he likes
hip-hop, the guy already



thinks he defends violence,
that he's a gangster...



Take it easy, Evandro.
Let's speak one at a time.



Valter, why do you think he is
defending violence?



Here, oh. He said it
already at the beginning.



The idea of having wings doesn't make
me feel good anymore, I want to crawl.



He doesn't want to have wings because he
gave up on being good. He wants to slither.



He said that peace is silly,
and truth is nonsense.



The guy wants to
see blood.



Peace, truth... it's all pretty words,
brother. He's putting you on, man.



OK, that's part too.



This feeling that nothing written has
any value.



Well thought out books are
well-paid prostitutes.



Higher up there are 2 words.
Wings and crawling.



No sense. No truth.



Valter, why would someone
prefer to crawl if they could fly?



Isn't it an absurd image?
Why do you think he wrote this?



Because there are folks who prefer to be
rats, snakes. They like to be on the ground.



Are you like that, man?



You didn't understand anything,
brother?



Your head is underground, brother.
Buried in the sand.



You have to listen before
disagreeing. Evandro, please.



Valter, allow me to ask you a favor.
Read the last line of the poem.



Although I wanted to stop, now I know
that you can't stop blood.



What is this blood for you?



The blood of violence,
that kills.



OK...



But what if this blood, in this poem,
isn't a synonym for death.



But rather of life.



Blood pumping here inside.
Blood that keeps us alive.



- Wanting life.
Wanting more.



The war which has already begun in us.



The violence of being alive,
being mortal.



There are some who are more mortal than
others, right?



What Ferréz is saying, man,
is that only



the angels get on well, you get it?
Those who have money.



And we kill, among brothers to get it.
And get wings.



Oh, the wings flapping.



Don't you see. This is wrong, brother.
Not having wings is wrong.



It's our blood that he's talking about.



Or rather, now that the
blood is different.



There are the red-blooded, blue-blooded,
rich blooded, poor blooded...



Evandro, you transform anyone who
is different from you into an enemy.



In this way, my dear student, there's no
dialogue, no discussion.



Got it?



We can exchange ideas,
you see?



But the words don't have much
value. They don't say much.



The blood is the poor's because
that's what's on the street.



It's not yours,
it's mine.



FOOD FOR THE PEOPLE



Fuckin' bitch.



You really do want to die,
don't you, son of bitch.



Come one, get out of this
shit, son of a bitch.



Come on.



Get out of this shit,
Go, you prick.



Do you need to go back and
kill the crazy one?



Wasn't that what we agreed?



Our agreement was different.
You sucker.



And now what?



I did what I had to do,
OK, man?



I stabbed the guy and didn't know if he was
alive or not, and went back and burnt him.



- It had to end sometime.
- Lower your voice.



Do you want the whole world to
know you killed a guy?



You should have done your
work and left, urchin.



- You're the chump, son of bitch.
- Fuck you, man.



Another thing. The next time
you put your hand



on me, I'll break your
teeth with a hammer.



You weren't supposed
to kill the crazy guy.



You were supposed to
get the stuff and get out.



- Fuck you.
- You sucker.



And this shit here.



Prick.



- Fuck you
- You're screwed.



We screwed up, but no one
came after us.



Dad...



Oh, little one.



Now what?



I don't know.



What are we going to do?



I'll let the dog run free for awhile.



If he messes up the plants,
I'll clean it up.



- Did you see that?
- Man alive!



There has to be a way to solve that.
A right way to solve it.



What do you want to do?



Are you going to knock on
their door and ask to be let in...



or what? Call the police?



I don't know, Francisco.
I only know that it was my father who



built this house here,
brick by brick, man.



- My kids were born here, damn it.
- So what?



Do you have a gun at home,
Francisco?



We're not bandits, Valter.
And they know that.



- And so what?
- And so what?



And so we'll be quiet,
mouths shut.



What are you going to do
with a gun?



They look like bandits.
We look like workers.



Each one has his fate.



I'm sewing up the holes and
you and your apples.



This deal of being
officially employed or not...



if you do the wrong thing.
You're fired.



Yeah. Of course. But it's just that...



if something happend to me, I'd have a



pension, my guaranteed
retirement fund, right?



My family would have it made.



It's money I take from your salary now
and give to the governemnt.



And you don't ever get it all back.



Do you know where this
money goes, do you?



Valter.



I'm satisfied with your work.



On my side, it's all perfect.



So, everything's fine.
I'm OK too.



I see it this way, Valter.



This thing of officially signing on an
employee is for those who can't be trusted.



Your work card, contract, written down,
is for those who don't trust others.



I trust you.



I need to work with people
who trust me.



Of course.



So, I need to know.
Do you feel you can't trust me?



No, because if it is, here's the deal,
I don't want to fight with you.



- You can leave and it's ok.
- What, are you saying, Zé?



No, no... with me everything is ok.



I've been under a lot of pressure,
Zé, from all directions.



And when you're really worried,
you know?



All of a sudden, something happens,
and you've got a little kid.



That's the only reason I thought of
talking to you, Zé.



Forget about it.
It's just nonsense.



I'll forget
I've already forgotten it.



You're here, Mr. Dimas?



I've just got a bit of time on
my hands.



Waiting for those dogs
to leave the house.



Oh, kid. Good evening.



Hey, man.



Give me a light, old man.



Give me a light, damn you.



There it is.



- Delicious.
- Too good.



Bené is such a yellow belly.



I tried to help him out,
but...



Oh, child, haven't I told you
not to agree...



I'll find some poisoned meatballs



Better yet - meatballs with glass in them.
Cuts you all the way down.



With animals it has to be like that.
They have to implode.



Yesterday, he even took his shoes off
in the middle of the road.



To go in softly.



Totally crazy,
right?



Are you afraid?
You're ajoke.



What's that, son?



The teacher asked us to make a story.
A drawing without words.



Like a comic book.



Oh, like that.



Here are the bandits. Here is one
that you almost can't see.



The others are shooting
at the house.



The house was
full of holes.



There's a very small boy here.



Look.



He grows, grows, grows,
He's huge.



He even shatters the wall
and flattens the bandits.



Valter.



- Anyone home?
- It's Mr. Dimas there?



- Hi, Mr. Dimas.
- I'm not one to invade anyone's home.



No, of course, no problem.



But come this way, please
Mr Dimas.



Have a seat, Mr. Dimas.



- I'm sorry, neighbor.
- No, nothing to be sorry for.



Everything's fine.



Can I offer you something?
Some juice?



- I don't want to cause any trouble.
- No, no trouble at all. It's already ready.



Just a minute.



- Are you going to leave?
- No. No.



I'm just going to sit outside a bit
with Mr. Dimas.



Finish your homework, Diogo.
Do a good job.



- Cock-a-doodle-doo, he went far, far away.
- Stop that kiddo.



Here we are, Mr. Dimas.



I've known you since you were a child.
I knew your father.



All of a sudden, everything
seems strange.



Seems like a wind...



...cold, bad...



spoiled. No one wants
to get close.



If that's happening within my own home
what do you do?



It's like a plague.



This sickness isn't mine.



But it's so close I can smell it.



Yesterday when I was getting home from work,
one of them was



hiding some stuff
in the pile of stones in my house.



He came close,
seemed to want to say something



- What did you see?
- What did you see?



What did you see?



- What did you see, man?
- Tell me, man.



What did you see?



I saw that there was
a girl in their house.



One left and the other one
was alone with the girl.



I'm sorry, Mr. Dimas. I don't
really understand. Can you try again?



This girl that you saw.
Was it a child or a woman?



I went inside
and turned on the TV.



The guy who had been
with the girl, went inside.



He said the TV
was really loud.



He said: Turn off that shit, there.



He came in and broke the TV.



The only thing I could do
was hold on to him.



But he got my legs and
bit me.



Which ripped the skin
off my shin.



Oh my, Mr. Dimas.
It's really bad there.



It's better to have Fransciso look at it,
since he's a nurse. It could get infected.



It's fine, it's fine.
Leave it alone.



I don't know if I
have any friends yet.



I'm really confused.



I'm afraid of dying.



I thought you could give me
your cell phone number.



If things get bad, I could call
you and you could call the police.



Or even ask someone for help.



Since we're friends,
I thought about that.



Just a minute, Mr. Dimas.



I've got a wife and kids.



I've got a wife and kids.



I've got a wife and kids.



This son of a bitch,
has nothing to lose.



I've got a wife and kids.



Thanks, Valter.



My milk man, so subtle



with a light, calm step,



seems to glide
more than walk.



There's always rumors in the making:



A false step,



a flower pot in the way,



a dog barking just to do it,
or an annoying cat.



And there's always a man who wakes up
complains and goes back to sleep.



But this one wakes up
in a panic,



thieves infest the district,



he couldn't think of
anything else.



The revolver in the drawer
jumped into his hand.



The shots in the wee hours



took out the milk man.



If he was engaged,



a virgin,



if he was happy or good,



From the smashed bottle
on the tile floor, which is already serene



something thick runs over it



maybe milk, blood...
I don't know.



Among the confusion of stuff
poorly redeemed in the night



two colors
search for each other



they softly touch



lovingly
they intertwine



making a third tone



which we call the dawn.



It's so sad, professor.



Yes...



It's a very sad story.



So peaceful,
isn't it?



All of a sudden, due to a noise,
it all happens.



Then everything
calms down again.



The day breaks,



but it's all already
different.



And the colors at the end,
right?



Two colors search for each other,
they softly touch



What colors are these?



What is he talking about?



The milk man's blood and the
milk mixed.



The blood, the milk
and the sunrise.



When it's so calm like that...



that's when I really get
worried.



Fear of peace.



What does 'redeemed' mean?



Redeemed comes from
'redeem.'



Redemption.



Salvation.



Salvation.



It's as if the daylight had
the power to redeem,



to save the objects and all the
lives from the dark of night.



As it wasn't day. The objects
were poorly redeemed at night.



And the milk man
wasn't saved.



Like Evandro.



Like Evandro.



May he rest in peace.



There's still quite a bit of confusion
going on outside, if you



want to stay here for a while.
Please feel free to do so, ok?



Look professor.



Oh, thanks.



Valter.



- Mr. Dimas.
- It's ok, we're getting on fine.



Me and boys there.
We are talking again.



- What are you talking about, Mr. Dimas?
- There's no story. We worked it out.



I'm even going to travel with them
at the end of the year. Take a trip.



What can you do?



Everything changed.



Nothing moves backward.



Life is what it is.



Each one does what he can.



Have a good Sunday.



I can't understand this, Iara.
Not on my life.



It hasn't been very long, man. Just the



other day, Mr. Dimas
was sitting right there.



He asked for some juice. Then asked for
my cell phone number in case



he needed something he could call me
and I'd ask the police for help.



Now this, Iara?
They are friends.



I can't understand.



Looks like the whole street
has got used to them, you guess?



The bandits bring candy for the kids.
I don't understand.



The guy almost took a piece out of
Mr. Dimas' shin, Iara.



Almost took a piece.
Now, they're friends.



He says they'll travel together
at the end of the year.



The other day I saw him
messing around in that



pile of rubble there
is back there, you know?



Where they hide things.



He was looking for something there.



...corner kick for the Corinthian team.
A high ball in front of Cruzeiro's goal.



The ball was taken from
prof. Michael.



So it was left for Luis Fernando.
He headed it.



Let's go, Nanda!



I'm coming, mom,
Where's my pink barrette?



Put your hand on my butt.
Fuck you.



How sweet!



Look, my new barrette.



Oh, my little princess,
what a beauty you are.



Give daddy a kiss.



- Don't let go of your mom's hand, OK?
- OK.



You're really not coming?



No, Iara.



I'm tired of noise.



Don't let her play in the street, Iara.



When the game is over,
I'll go pick you up.



OK, I think it's better if
you tie up the dog.



With all this movement on the street.
He might jump over the wall.



OK?



- Come inside.
- I'm coming, Mom.



Dad, it's ringing.



Hello.



Diogo, let's go get
your mom. It's getting late.



It's real exciting inside.
Aren't you coming in, Valter?



No, no, Fatima.
I have to work tomorrow.



Do you have any idea if Mr. Dimas
is inside?



No, I haven't seen him.



I guess he prefered to stay there.
With his new friends.



Dad, mom made it for you.



Thanks, honey.



And she asked you to
come in.



Come on in, Valter.



Since you've come this far, it's impolite
if stand out here and not come in.



OK, but just for a bit,
OK, Iara?



Hello!



Wait, I can't hear anything.



Hi, hello.



What?



Who died?



Hello?



Hello?



Go!
Go!



Go, man.



Hey, the dogs.



They came to lick the blood that
was left over here. It's still fresh.



Will you change professions
when you're old.



Move away. Move away.
We'll take care of this.



We'll kill you.



Move away. Move away.
We'll take care of this.



You assholes



Fuck you.



It was you, wasn't it,
man?



- It was you, right?
- Get out! Get out!



I'm going get you,
son of a bitch.



You want to see us taking a beating, do you?
Sons of a bitch.



Sons of a bitch.



Go! Go! Go!



Who's family?



- I'll go.
- Come on.



It's all covered with blood,
Valter.



Francisco was the one
who saw it.



He came walking down the street
and saw it.



Some red stains on the ground.



So then he peered over the
gate.



There was blood everywhere,
Valter.



Tell me how can this be,
Valter!



They were there sleeping next to him
after all this.



I couldn't believe my eyes. So
I looked and saw it was as I had seen it.



Iara!



Iara!
Are you there?



Fatima, come in.
The gate is open.



- Hi, dear.
- Hi.



- Hey, what's up?
- Let's have some coffee in the kitchen.



Hi,



It was here.



You can really see it all.



Goodness, seems like we're
really inside the house



Yeah, and it seems that
they were here inside too.



That little child's voice...



"uncle, uncle, uncle."



Iara!
Are you there?



Oh, Iara.



Come in, Teresinha.
The gate is open.



Hi, Fê;



Have a seat. Relax a bit.
The coffee is fresh made.



Hi, Iara.



- Hi, Fatima.
- Hi.



You won't believe, my heart
is still going wild.



Feels like it's going to
come up out of my mouth.



I thought the police had come
after Manoel.



He's held up in his room so far.
How scary.



I told Manoel.
I told him.



Manoel stay away from these
people, Manoel.



Just as well, because if not...



I don't know. Look at
Mr. Dimas, poor thing.



He tried to get involved with
the things of others. And oh...



It's really strange that they would
be friends all of a sudden.



No one is going to change
my mind, that is was



to attract the poor
guy and then kill him.



They came with that intention
sent by Consuelo.



She wanted to get rid of her
husband to keep the house.



Do you think so?



Come look at the pile of rubble
there.



Go see, Fatima.



I can see.



I saw Mr. Dimas messing
in the pile of rubble there.



That's where the bandits hid
their things.



Didn't I tell you?
Didn't I tell you?



Mr. Dimas did something.



They wouldn't kill him
just like that...



They were just folk there...
even helped out.



Helping is a 'gang' thing.



Wherever they go
they do that.



Hang on.



Let me tell you what happened.



I went to the window. Real slow like.
On tiptoe.



To watch, you know?



So, one of them... you know the one
that was stronger...



He went into the patio,
a bit groggy.



And started to pee.



- Right here, below the wall...
- Hi, Valter.



Hi, Valter.



Imagine if he looked up and saw me.



If they were from the gang,
the would be more organized.



They wouldn't lay around
drunk, you know?



Listen.



So, I called Valter.



He told me to pretend that everything
was normal, to the bandits



and not show that I knew that the police
were on the way. Oh, that's dificult, right?



Normal, normal. What is normal?
Full of blood here on the side.



I started to clean house.



I got Fernanda and Diogo
to help me.



- Didn't I?
- Yeah.



It seemed as if the
blood was here inside.



The man from the store above
came to see.



He said that the bandits stopped by to
buy a garbage bag.



They are so stupid. They stood there
waiting for the police to come.



Had it been me I would have hidden,
or run away.



But he's no coward.
Did you hear what he said?



I did it. I've killed and
I'll do it again.



They didn't even change
their blood stained clothes...



They pulled out his teeth,
you know?



Nothing was left.
Only the whole.



They said he was cut all over,
Valter.



Mr. Dimas - all
sliced up.



Ripped off his nose, cut off his fingers...
- Stop, Iara.



That's enough!



Cock-a-doodle-doo.
Cock-a-doodle-doo.



Here.



Stop, right there.
Stop.



Good morning, Valter.



Morning, Ms. Consuelo.



How is Ms. Iara?



And the kids?



They're all ok Ms. Consuelo,
everything's fine.



What a mess, yeah?



Some new people are
coming.



Now I just need to scrub and
wash and clean.



- See you.
- Yeah, see you.
