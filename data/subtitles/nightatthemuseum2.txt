1
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:35,213
<i>What if</i>
<i>this was your house?</i>

2
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:36,841
<i>Power's out.</i>
<i>Lights are dead.</i>

3
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,050
<i>Your little ones in their bunk
bed down the hall, crying out...</i>

4
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:41,469
Mommy! Daddy!
Come quick! I'm scared!

5
00:03:41,597 --> 00:03:43,723
<i>- You need to get there, and fast.</i>
- Coming, honey! Daddy's coming!

6
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:46,266
<i>You'll need a weapon. But first,
you'll need a flashlight.</i>

7
00:03:46,602 --> 00:03:48,311
<i>But you're in the dark!</i>
<i>What are you gonna do?</i>

8
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:50,312
<i>How are you gonna find it?</i>
<i>I'll tell you how.</i>

9
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:52,147
The Glow-in-the-Dark
Flashlight!

10
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:55,817
That's right, folks! I'm Larry
Daley of Daley Devices,

11
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:58,153
and we're gonna spend the
next paid-programing block

12
00:03:58,237 --> 00:03:59,487
rocking your world.

13
00:03:59,615 --> 00:04:01,407
And I brought along
a friend to do it.

14
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,491
George Foreman,
ladies and gentlemen!

15
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:08,413
Fantastic, Larry, fantastic!
Isn't he fantastic, America?

16
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:16,838
But, seriously, isn't it true
that just two years ago,

17
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:19,507
you were working as a night
guard at some dusty museum?

18
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:22,345
That is true, two-time world
heavyweight champ George Foreman.

19
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:26,641
I was just a regular Joe with
a flashlight and a dream.

20
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:28,768
You mean a regular Larry.

21
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:41,447
But what's no joke is you're
CEO of Daley Devices,

22
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:46,284
creator of such indispensable
items as the Super Big Dog Bone!

23
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:48,954
You like that one?

24
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:50,413
The Unlosable Key Ring!

25
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:52,124
Oh, yeah,
that little chestnut!

26
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:54,377
And now your
latest breakthrough...

27
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:56,252
Say it with me, America!

28
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:59,090
The Glow-in-the-Dark
Flashlight!

29
00:05:02,134 --> 00:05:04,552
Whatever the household crisis, this
is Daley Devices. Can I help you?

30
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:07,098
Gina, give this back to Stewart.
I don't trust his math, okay?

31
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:08,766
That guy called again.
Again?

32
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:12,853
Lar! Huge news! We got
the Wal-Mart meeting.

33
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:15,564
- No! When?
- Yeah. Three days.

34
00:05:16,108 --> 00:05:17,827
Okay, all right. We got
a lot of work to do.

35
00:05:17,858 --> 00:05:21,112
Well, okay, did you just hear me
say "Wal" and "Mart" together?

36
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,697
Yeah! I know,
it's huge.

37
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,781
So just take a second
to be happy about it.

38
00:05:24,865 --> 00:05:26,574
All right. Hey!

39
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,035
You're totally
making fun of me.

40
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,519
No, let's hold off on the victory
parade till we close, okay?

41
00:05:30,579 --> 00:05:32,081
You got it.

42
00:05:32,456 --> 00:05:33,499
And when does
he want to meet?

43
00:05:33,582 --> 00:05:34,983
They want Friday morning,
10:00 a.m.

44
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:36,721
Okay, then, you know what?
Cancel that pitch

45
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:39,036
for the electric saw thing
with the propeller, all right?

46
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:40,449
I just want to focus on this.
Okay.

47
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:42,226
Just this. My daughter's
birthday, canceled!

48
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:57,648
You can go home. I'm gonna
be pretty late, okay.

49
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,108
Okay, boss.

50
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:16,917
Hello! Excuse me!
Unauthorized personnel!

51
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:20,713
Oh! If it isn't our very own
Mr. Success Story.

52
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,298
Come for one of your
nostalgia tours?

53
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,781
I haven't seen you
for a few months.

54
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:27,802
Yeah, I've been busy.
What's going on here?

55
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,973
Progress, so they tell me.

56
00:06:31,475 --> 00:06:37,437
The future. Behold, Natural
History, version 2.0.

57
00:06:43,819 --> 00:06:47,156
<i>Welcome to The Museum of Natural
History, where history comes to life!</i>

58
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:49,074
<i>Step up,</i>
<i>ask your question.</i>

59
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:51,576
<i>Then let the next little boy
or girl have their turn.</i>

60
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:56,624
Okay, where were you born?

61
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,043
<i>Right here in New York
City, on Twentieth Street.</i>

62
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:02,295
<i>October 27th,</i>
<i>the year of our Lord 1858.</i>

63
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:08,761
Blah, blah, blah. History, history.
Learning, learning.

64
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:11,055
Changing America,
one child at a time.

65
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:15,391
That's great. So you're adding
some new interactive exhibits?

66
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:19,355
No, Mr. Daley, not adding.
Replacing the old exhibits.

67
00:07:19,855 --> 00:07:20,898
Where are they going?

68
00:07:20,981 --> 00:07:22,024
Away.

69
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,901
We're getting rid of all this junk.
The dioramas, the waxworks,

70
00:07:24,985 --> 00:07:26,862
even some of the
shabbier animals,

71
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:28,697
like this
scrawny little monkey.

72
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,574
You should be careful.
He's a capuchin.

73
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:33,536
It's a monkey.

74
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,538
He's a rare breed. He's a capuchin.
He's not just a monkey.

75
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:39,834
"Monkey", then. I said "monkey".
Why be specific?

76
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:42,086
When you're throwing away a monkey,
you don't need the Latin name.

77
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,711
Are you throwing him away
or are you moving him?

78
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:46,507
What are you,
the Primate Garbage Police?

79
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:48,050
Let it go, baby.

80
00:07:48,884 --> 00:07:50,427
- Whose idea was this?
- Me, of course.

81
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,387
I'm in charge.
Me and the board.

82
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:53,805
Mainly the board.

83
00:07:53,889 --> 00:07:56,141
Anyway, why do you care?

84
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,978
No, it's just that
people love this stuff.

85
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:02,273
People, Mr. Daley, love "What's next?"

86
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,733
You should know that.
You left.

87
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,819
My situation changed.
My business took off...

88
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:09,572
Yeah, you became a success.
So would I, if I was a night guard.

89
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:11,906
So where are
these guys going?

90
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:15,451
Deep storage.
Federal Archives.

91
00:08:16,745 --> 00:08:18,581
- Where's that?
- Washington, D.C.

92
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,665
The Smithsonian.

93
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,375
There's got to be something
that we can do.

94
00:08:22,459 --> 00:08:28,339
It's done! They leave tomorrow morning.
It's over.

95
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,001
Hey.

96
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:07,629
Hey, buddy,
how you doing? Huh?

97
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,089
How you doing
with all this?

98
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:11,759
Oh. You want
what's in here? Huh?

99
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:13,163
You think I got
something for you?

100
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:15,721
You think I got
a little rope? Huh?

101
00:09:15,804 --> 00:09:18,724
Think you're stronger
than me, huh? Whoa!

102
00:09:18,807 --> 00:09:20,267
Is that all you got, huh?

103
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:40,913
Lawrence!
Good to see you, lad!

104
00:09:40,996 --> 00:09:42,498
Yeah, you too, Teddy.

105
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,625
The Guardian of Brooklyn
has returned!

106
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,919
Hey, Ahk. Look, McPhee told me
what's going on around here.

107
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,379
- I had no idea.
- Indeed.

108
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:51,923
A lot has transpired, Lawrence,
since your last visit.

109
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,259
One would say that...

110
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,678
- Just...
- Cricket.

111
00:09:57,681 --> 00:10:01,517
Hey, Bocephus!
Little help over here!

112
00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:05,437
Hey.

113
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:09,191
Hey, fellas.
How you doing?

114
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,777
Well, lookee here.

115
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:14,363
If it ain't
Mr. Big-in-the-Britches himself,

116
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,823
come back just in time
to see us off!

117
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:19,201
Yeah, Jed, I heard. Look, I don't
even know how this happened.

118
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:24,038
Yeah. Yeah, real mystery
how this happened.

119
00:10:24,164 --> 00:10:27,583
Maybe the answer's on that magic
buzzing box there in your hand!

120
00:10:28,043 --> 00:10:30,921
You weren't here, Gigantor!
That's how it happened!

121
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,298
Ain't no mystery!

122
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:35,341
The fact is, Larry, there's no
one else here to speak on our behalf

123
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:36,634
during business hours.

124
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,013
None, none, dum-dum.

125
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,642
Hey, guys! It's okay!

126
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:46,144
I'll call the board in the morning,
all right? I got some pull now.

127
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:48,147
I'll handle this.
We're gonna be okay here.

128
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,566
"We"? Did you hear that?
You hear Daydream Johnny?

129
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:54,528
There ain't been a "we" ever since you
put us on the "pay no mind" list.

130
00:10:54,611 --> 00:10:56,904
And that's a cold place
to be, boy.

131
00:10:57,032 --> 00:10:59,240
Larry, what's done is done.

132
00:11:01,076 --> 00:11:04,038
Even the glory of Rome
had to come to an end.

133
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:08,333
Would you please not look dramatically
off into the middle distance

134
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:10,057
when you say that?
It makes me feel worse.

135
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:12,211
I don't know what
you're talking about.

136
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:15,423
Where are you looking? Where are
you looking? I'm over here.

137
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:19,970
Just a bit of wall.

138
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:21,764
Look, guys,
maybe it won't be so bad.

139
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,850
Yes, you make
a good point.

140
00:11:24,933 --> 00:11:26,894
But this is the Smithsonian
we're talking about here.

141
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:29,772
Dexter, you don't know that.

142
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:34,485
You're missing the point, Gigantor!
They're shipping us out!

143
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:36,945
Larry, I know you're trying
to make us feel better.

144
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,907
I can see that you're
genuinely slightly bothered,

145
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,076
but it's never
going to be the same.

146
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:44,661
All of us here, together,
in this place.

147
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:47,246
It ain't never
gonna be home, boy.

148
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:53,796
Jedediah, please! Lawrence, these
are emotional times for all of us.

149
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:56,673
But it is our last night
as a family,

150
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:59,592
and I don't want to see it
squandered in self-pity.

151
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:05,390
So who will join me for one final
stroll through these hallowed halls?

152
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:10,019
- Do you want to go for a walk?
- No.

153
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,606
I'm just gonna squander
it in self-pity.

154
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:15,775
My dear, shall we?

155
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:46,139
Safe journey, my love.

156
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:52,019
Hey, Dexter,
want some help there?

157
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:59,027
Hey, come on, man. No
hard feelings, all right?

158
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:00,946
It's gonna be fine.

159
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:05,325
It's almost dawn, Lawrence.

160
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:10,038
Yeah. So, where's
your crate, Teddy?

161
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:11,956
I won't be making
this journey, Lawrence.

162
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:15,711
It seems myself, Rexy, and a
few of the signature exhibits

163
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:18,379
will be staying here
for now.

164
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:20,716
Without the tablet?

165
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:24,385
In truth, Lawrence,

166
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:31,518
Ahkmenrah's tablet will be
remaining here with him.

167
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:34,270
What?

168
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:37,065
They're going without
the tablet, my friend.

169
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:39,567
I'm afraid this night
is their last.

170
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:43,447
You didn't tell them.

171
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:47,701
Sometimes it's more noble to tell a
small lie than deliver a painful truth.

172
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:04,342
Are you gonna be okay?

173
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:06,094
I shall do my best.

174
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:10,057
And who knows?

175
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,976
Sometimes the greatest change brings
about even greater opportunity.

176
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:15,562
Look at you, Lawrence.

177
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:19,399
You left this place and created
quite a life for yourself.

178
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:23,820
Yeah, I guess so.

179
00:14:24,239 --> 00:14:26,405
I should hope you'd do
more than guess, my friend.

180
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:29,993
You're a captain of industry.
The world at your fingertips.

181
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:31,879
It seems to me you have
everything you wanted.

182
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,913
Yeah, no, I know.

183
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:37,500
No, you don't.
If I may, lad,

184
00:14:38,126 --> 00:14:40,629
allow me to offer you
one piece of advice.

185
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:45,133
The key to happiness,
to true happiness, is...

186
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:49,136
Hang on one sec.
I just gotta...

187
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:52,432
I got this Japanese deal.

188
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:56,812
No, okay, I'm turning this off.
I'm sorry.

189
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,980
The key to happiness?

190
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:11,826
I'll see you, Teddy.

191
00:15:39,187 --> 00:15:41,523
So they're gone? There's
nothing you can do?

192
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,969
I wish there was, man. I'm
telling you, I tried everything.

193
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:46,485
I talked to McPhee,
I called the board,

194
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:48,404
but they shipped them out
this morning.

195
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,032
This is a lot of food, Dad.

196
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:52,743
Yeah. Ed from work's gonna come by.
I thought I told you.

197
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:55,029
We just have to go over a
couple of little work things.

198
00:15:55,078 --> 00:15:56,955
So you're working tonight.

199
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,480
I used to work
every night, remember?

200
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:00,875
That was when you had the
coolest job in the world.

201
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:05,129
Yeah, well, "cool" doesn't pay for
your <i>Guitar God VI</i> or whatever.

202
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:06,214
Hello?

203
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,133
<i>Gigantor!</i>
<i>It's me, Jedediah!</i>

204
00:16:08,216 --> 00:16:10,719
<i>- Hold! Hold!</i>
- Jed?

205
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:12,178
<i>Never surrender!</i>

206
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:14,597
Jed, what are you...
How did you dial the phone?

207
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:17,142
Long story! That brazen little
monkey stole the tablet,

208
00:16:17,225 --> 00:16:19,352
and now we're in
a world of hurt, boy!

209
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:21,605
- What's going on?
- Kahmunrah!

210
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:24,566
- Kahmunrah?
- Ahkmenrah's big brother! He's here!

211
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,735
- And trust me, not a friendly!
- Never!

212
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,486
I repeat,
not a friendly!

213
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:30,572
- Is that Attila, Jed?
<i>- I don't know how much longer</i>

214
00:16:30,697 --> 00:16:32,073
- <i>we can fight them off! No!</i>
- Jed? Are you okay?

215
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,575
- <i>Let go of me! Help!</i>
- Hey, Jed.

216
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:35,619
- <i>Let go! No, you let go of me! Help!</i>
- Jed?

217
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:39,413
What was that about?

218
00:16:44,419 --> 00:16:46,046
I don't know.

219
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:49,383
Here, come on. Gonna drop
you off at your mom's.

220
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:50,509
What's going on, Dad?

221
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:52,134
I'm gonna go find out.

222
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:56,932
Okay, buddy, McPhee said the Federal
Archives are in the Smithsonian.

223
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:58,475
Where exactly am I going?

224
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,770
That's the thing, Dad. The Smithsonian
is actually 19 different museums.

225
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:04,564
They're laid out
around the National Mall,

226
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:07,275
from the Capitol
to the Lincoln Memorial.

227
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:10,487
They got everything there. There's
actually some really cool stuff.

228
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:13,781
Nicky, please focus. Which
museum are the Archives in?

229
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:17,451
Not in, under. It looks like it runs
underneath the entire Smithsonian.

230
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:19,746
So if Ahkmenrah's tablet
is down there...

231
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:22,332
The biggest museum in the
world is coming alive.

232
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,041
<i>What is exactly</i>
<i>is your plan here, Dad?</i>

233
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:25,251
Don't worry about it.

234
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:26,461
You have no plan,
do you?

235
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:29,798
Now, Nicholas, I have a very
good, highly thought-out plan.

236
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:31,048
You have no plan.

237
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:32,217
Yes, I have no plan.

238
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,676
I'll call you
when I'm in.

239
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:44,311
Here you go. Thanks.

240
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:03,623
Welcome to the biggest
museum in the world.

241
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,666
I know, right?
It's a trip.

242
00:18:05,792 --> 00:18:08,878
How about these planes dangling from
the ceilings, huh? Pretty weird.

243
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:11,685
Hi, excuse me. Could you tell me how
to get to the Federal Archives?

244
00:18:11,798 --> 00:18:15,926
Of course. Just be a historical document
worthy of storing for all eternity.

245
00:18:17,637 --> 00:18:19,346
I'm kidding.
He's not a document.

246
00:18:19,891 --> 00:18:23,727
I'm sorry, sir, the Archives are
underground, and they're a secure area.

247
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:27,521
Really? Like, totally secure?
Okay, thank you.

248
00:19:09,941 --> 00:19:11,340
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

249
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,236
<i>the museum will be</i>
<i>closing in one hour.</i>

250
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,613
Kahmunrah.

251
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:09,540
Hey!
What are you doing?

252
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:11,835
No touching.

253
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,044
No, I wasn't
gonna touch it.

254
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:15,130
You're moving in
with some I.T.T., bro.

255
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:17,382
I.T.T.? That's "Intent
to Touch" ', homey.

256
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,550
No, I wasn't. You're not
allowed to go over the...

257
00:20:19,634 --> 00:20:20,715
What, are you
gonna kiss it?

258
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,011
All right, sorry.

259
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:24,306
Put your hand on it and touch it.
'Cause I stand there

260
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:27,057
and I wait all day for a little
girl like you to come in

261
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:30,228
and put her precious nail-polished
nails all over the exhibits.

262
00:20:30,313 --> 00:20:33,153
Sorry. Last time I checked, I thought
we lived in a free country, so...

263
00:20:33,231 --> 00:20:34,316
- No, we don't.
- No?

264
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,734
It's the United States of Don't Touch
That Thing Right in Front of You.

265
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:38,486
I just want to... I'm allowed
to look at it here, okay?

266
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:39,932
See what happens
when you touch it!

267
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:42,365
So you're threatening me?
You're threatening me, Brandon?

268
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,326
- It's "Brundon."
- Excuse me?

269
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:45,911
- "Brundon"!
- "Brundon"?

270
00:20:46,244 --> 00:20:47,662
- "Brundon."
- "Brundon."

271
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:50,414
What, did they run out of U's
on your nameplate maker?

272
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:51,833
I don't know,
did they run out of jokes

273
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,799
at the interesting-joke
store that you shop at?

274
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:56,086
Sorry, it looks like
"Brandon", but...

275
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:58,131
I'm not here to be your speech therapist.
It's "Brundon"!

276
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,840
- "Brundon." Okay...
- You never heard of the name before?

277
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:01,259
"Brundon"? No.

278
00:21:01,344 --> 00:21:04,596
Look up most popular baby names in 1984.
"Brundon."

279
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,348
Okay. Are you threatening
me, Brundon?

280
00:21:07,974 --> 00:21:09,768
I don't know,
Princess Jasmine. Am I?

281
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:12,269
Oh, wow. Lunabeam nine-volt.
Yeah.

282
00:21:12,355 --> 00:21:13,688
Wonderful piece
of hardware, huh?

283
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:15,440
- That's their title, Lunabeam Nine.
- Great.

284
00:21:15,523 --> 00:21:18,026
I prefer the Maglite LED
myself, but that's just me.

285
00:21:18,109 --> 00:21:20,028
- Do me a huge favor.
- What?

286
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,613
Shove your hands
into your pockets,

287
00:21:21,696 --> 00:21:24,115
put your attitude
way down,

288
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,991
and, also,
be nice to people.

289
00:21:26,826 --> 00:21:28,619
Great. But could I just
ask you one thing?

290
00:21:28,703 --> 00:21:30,454
- Yeah.
- Okay, so just to be clear,

291
00:21:30,538 --> 00:21:31,789
so, I can't do this, right?

292
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:33,708
Okay, that's
actually crazy.

293
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,501
Did you just make a decision
to possibly end your life

294
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:36,627
earlier than
you were expecting?

295
00:21:36,711 --> 00:21:38,003
I'm gonna hit you
with the flashlight.

296
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:40,166
- Now you are threatening me.
- Okay. Do not touch it!

297
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:41,715
- Don't touch me.
- Do not touch it!

298
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:43,134
- Do not touch it!
- Don't touch me!

299
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:44,469
I'll touch you with
my flashlight all day.

300
00:21:44,552 --> 00:21:46,136
No, your flashlight
is meant to illuminate.

301
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:48,722
I will literally
rent a camper,

302
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:51,367
and we will drive across America
with my flashlight on your chest.

303
00:21:51,394 --> 00:21:53,310
- Don't do that.
- Don't do what?

304
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,063
Want to see what happens
when I do it one more time?

305
00:21:55,146 --> 00:21:57,067
- Let's see what happens.
- Watch you do nothing.

306
00:21:57,191 --> 00:21:58,983
Let's watch you do
nothing when I do this.

307
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:02,153
Seriously, Brandon...

308
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:04,405
- Brundon.
- Brundon,

309
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:06,240
you do not know
who you're dealing with.

310
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:08,826
You think you know what it
means to be a guard, huh?

311
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:11,078
Trust me, you don't know
the meaning of the word.

312
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:14,207
I have seen things
that you could not imagine.

313
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:15,834
Like what kind of stuff?

314
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:17,042
I'm not gonna tell you.

315
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,920
- But you're gonna drop the flashlight...
- The way you said it,

316
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:20,838
it sounded like you were
gonna say something cool.

317
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:22,923
Yeah, well, you don't
get to hear it.

318
00:22:23,049 --> 00:22:24,550
Drop the flashlight.

319
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:34,685
We cool?

320
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:37,271
That's actually pretty
cool, what you just did.

321
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:38,690
Thank you.

322
00:22:38,773 --> 00:22:40,607
No hard feelings?

323
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:43,361
- All right? Sorry.
- Okay.

324
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:45,526
- I'm sorry.
- No, It's my fault. I shouldn't have...

325
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:47,615
No. It takes two opposing forces
to cause friction, and...

326
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,339
And you're just doing
your job, all right.

327
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,536
Take it easy, man.

328
00:22:51,619 --> 00:22:52,746
Yeah!

329
00:22:53,788 --> 00:22:55,123
That guy's great.

330
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:41,877
Okay, buddy, I'm in.

331
00:23:41,961 --> 00:23:43,046
Great. Where are you?

332
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:45,673
<i>The northeast corridor
of the Castle, just off the Commons.</i>

333
00:23:45,965 --> 00:23:47,724
I need you to talk
me to the Archives.

334
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:48,200
<i>Okay.</i>

335
00:23:48,344 --> 00:23:49,927
At the end of the hall,
turn right,

336
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:52,173
and there should be a stairwell
coming up on your left.

337
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,016
- Got it.
- Now, it's kind of a maze down there.

338
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:57,852
Those underground tunnels connect
a bunch of different buildings.

339
00:23:57,936 --> 00:23:59,520
- <i>It could get complicated.</i>
- We'd better hurry,

340
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:01,522
we only got 28 minutes
till sundown.

341
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:03,607
<i>When you get down to B level, you
want to take another left...</i>

342
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:06,611
Nick? Hello? Nick?

343
00:24:06,694 --> 00:24:07,945
<i>Dad! Can you hear...</i>

344
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:09,446
Nick, you're... Nick!

345
00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:38,726
<i>ID, Brundon.</i>

346
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,394
Hey.

347
00:24:40,563 --> 00:24:41,729
<i>Later, dude.</i>

348
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:43,021
All right. Yeah.

349
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:55,326
All right.
Where are you guys?

350
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:29,461
Oh, my God.

351
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:05,539
You little troublemaker.
I'm gonna deal with you later.

352
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:47,123
No. No! No, no, no!

353
00:28:05,726 --> 00:28:07,434
No, English.
English, perhaps.

354
00:28:08,936 --> 00:28:10,313
I'm sorry,
who are you?

355
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:16,277
I am Kahmunrah, the great
king of the great kings,

356
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:19,739
and from the darkest depths
of ancient history,

357
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:23,742
I have come back to life!

358
00:28:24,827 --> 00:28:26,119
Uh-huh.

359
00:28:27,623 --> 00:28:30,708
Perhaps you did not hear
what I just said.

360
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:36,255
I am a centuries-old Egyptian Pharaoh.
I was dead,

361
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:40,801
but now I have
come back to life!

362
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:44,471
Yeah, no. I heard that.
I got that. Welcome back.

363
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:49,769
Who are you?

364
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:52,980
Larry Daley.
Daley Devices?

365
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:57,192
It's up in New York. It's funny,
I know your brother, Ahkmenrah.

366
00:28:57,318 --> 00:28:58,486
- Do you?
- Yeah.

367
00:28:58,569 --> 00:29:02,406
He knows baby brother.
The favorite son.

368
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:03,490
Yeah, good kid.

369
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:04,991
Isn't he just?

370
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:08,121
You know, Mother and Father always
gave him the best of everything,

371
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:11,457
and I do mean everything.
They even gave him the throne.

372
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,335
The throne which
was rightfully mine!

373
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,211
He never mentioned that.

374
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:17,755
I'll just bet he didn't.

375
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:20,967
Well, now begins
the era of Kahmunrah,

376
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:24,220
because I have
come back to...

377
00:29:24,346 --> 00:29:26,180
Never mind,
just hand me the tablet.

378
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:28,507
Don't give it to him, Gigantor!
Keep him away!

379
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:31,059
Silence!
Silence in there, please!

380
00:29:31,854 --> 00:29:33,186
Don't make me
come in there!

381
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:35,314
No!
I won't be muzzled!

382
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:38,608
Look, that tablet
is more powerful

383
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:43,197
than you, Larry Daley of Daley
Devices, can possibly imagine.

384
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:47,326
Bringing things back to life
is just a parlor trick.

385
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:50,621
With it, I shall unlock
the Gate to the Underworld

386
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:54,333
and bring forth my army
from the Land of the Dead.

387
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:57,377
So, if it's not
too much trouble...

388
00:30:00,339 --> 00:30:02,258
...hand it over.

389
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,386
Okay, here you go.

390
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:09,515
Wise decision.

391
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:15,395
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry, I thought
you wanted the Cube, but...

392
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:20,567
The Cube?

393
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:24,654
The Cube of Rubik.

394
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:33,122
All right, what is this
Cube of Rubik, then?

395
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:38,169
The Cube. You know, the one that
turns all who oppose you to dust?

396
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:41,172
That one?
Whatever. I thought...

397
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:43,336
It was my bad, 'cause...
You know what? By the way,

398
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:44,967
your brother didn't want
to mess with it, either.

399
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:46,384
Yeah, he wanted to
play it safe, too.

400
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:49,513
Just, you sort of struck me as a
next-level sort of guy, so I was...

401
00:30:51,642 --> 00:30:53,976
I am not my brother, Larry.

402
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:58,564
I will kill you and your friends
in the blink of an eye.

403
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:04,278
Now take me
to this Cube of Rubik.

404
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:08,657
Here it is.
Open it.

405
00:31:38,145 --> 00:31:40,146
Come back here! Come back
here with my tablet!

406
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:41,816
I still have
your friends!

407
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:00,459
Whoa!

408
00:32:20,771 --> 00:32:22,772
- Take the wheel!
- What?

409
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:26,359
I said, take the wheel! Oh, we're
in it now! I love it! I love it!

410
00:32:26,862 --> 00:32:28,487
Just keep her straight,
I'll handle the rest.

411
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:30,615
Now, charge!

412
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:38,748
Okay, so what's
the plan here?

413
00:32:38,832 --> 00:32:41,541
We're Americans!
We don't plan, we do!

414
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,376
Now hold on!

415
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:58,351
See that? Act first, think later!
Works every time!

416
00:32:58,434 --> 00:32:59,809
You're in good hands!

417
00:32:59,935 --> 00:33:03,647
General George A. Custer of the
Fighting U.S. 7th Cavalry,

418
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:05,357
at your service.

419
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:12,114
I'm good, I'm good!
Fly, you fool!

420
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:23,959
What's the rumpus, ace?

421
00:33:24,086 --> 00:33:25,377
Look, lady, could you
get out of the way?

422
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:28,088
Lady? Who are you calling lady?
The name is Amelia.

423
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:37,138
Amelia Earhart! Perhaps
you've heard of me?

424
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:40,017
Oh, right. You're a
famous pilot or whatever.

425
00:33:40,102 --> 00:33:42,811
Pilot? I was the first
woman to fly the Atlantic!

426
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:44,521
First woman to receive
the Flying Cross,

427
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:47,607
first woman to fly across the
48 states in a gyroprop.

428
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:50,528
Now if you'd wipe that perhaps-permanent
look of alarm off your kisser,

429
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:54,824
I was wondering if you might be so
kind as to tell me exactly where I am.

430
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:57,284
You're in a museum.
Or, actually, under it.

431
00:33:57,368 --> 00:34:00,162
And I'm in kind of a dangerous
situation right now,

432
00:34:00,247 --> 00:34:02,707
so you might not want
to be anywhere near me.

433
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:07,169
- Wow, you're fast.
- What's your name, flyboy?

434
00:34:07,878 --> 00:34:10,005
My name is Larry Daley.

435
00:34:10,507 --> 00:34:12,967
Well, Larry Daley, in case
you weren't listening,

436
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:15,177
I'm not one to
shy away from danger.

437
00:34:15,804 --> 00:34:18,681
How about spears? Are you one
to shy away from spears?

438
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:23,893
Let's ankle, skipper! Now
we're gonna have some fun.

439
00:34:27,481 --> 00:34:31,652
Ninety-eight,
ninety-nine, bingo!

440
00:34:33,947 --> 00:34:35,530
Like a Golden Fleece.

441
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:40,034
All right, troops, when
your enemies captured me,

442
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:42,288
they made themselves
my enemies as well.

443
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:45,750
Big mistake.
Big mistake.

444
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,545
All right,
here's the plan.

445
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:55,050
On the third bugle blast, I shall
loudly announce, "Attack!"

446
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:03,476
At which point, we will
all jump out of this box

447
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:06,771
and attack.

448
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:13,193
Boom.

449
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:17,239
Mind bomb.
What do you think?

450
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:22,244
You, Sacaja...

451
00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:23,536
That is not my name.

452
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:25,664
- Sacajamea.
- No.

453
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:28,000
- Sack-in-a-box.
- No.

454
00:35:28,083 --> 00:35:29,168
Cinco de Mayo.

455
00:35:29,251 --> 00:35:30,835
I know you are
a famous general...

456
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:31,961
That's all right,
that's all right.

457
00:35:32,047 --> 00:35:33,255
I'm a person,
just like you.

458
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:36,509
But won't yelling,
"Attack!" alert the enemy

459
00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:38,092
that we are
about to attack?

460
00:35:38,594 --> 00:35:39,929
What?

461
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,226
Uh...

462
00:35:48,438 --> 00:35:50,356
Yeah, I guess so.

463
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:58,197
You're quite the popular fellow,
Mr. Daley.

464
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,782
Why don't you
just skedaddle?

465
00:35:59,865 --> 00:36:01,826
I can't skedaddle. My friends
are being held down there.

466
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:04,619
I got to go get them.
I got to find another way down.

467
00:36:09,291 --> 00:36:10,416
Wow.

468
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:17,173
This is new.

469
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:26,559
Hey, it's all right.
I don't want to hurt you.

470
00:36:29,311 --> 00:36:31,351
I don't think it's you they're
afraid of, Mr. Daley.

471
00:36:38,153 --> 00:36:40,072
Trade you. Thanks.

472
00:36:40,657 --> 00:36:43,992
Back off!
Just back off!

473
00:36:45,202 --> 00:36:46,829
I will fork you!

474
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:48,664
How about you, huh?

475
00:36:51,501 --> 00:36:53,210
Never send a boy
to do a woman's job.

476
00:36:53,295 --> 00:36:56,005
I spent two weeks spear-hunting
with a tribe in Micronesia.

477
00:36:57,923 --> 00:36:59,967
The Micronesians had
much slower reflexes.

478
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:04,972
Come on!

479
00:37:09,643 --> 00:37:14,356
It's over! It's over!
It's all over!

480
00:37:17,943 --> 00:37:20,653
Well, this is one
humdinger of a hootenanny.

481
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:29,163
Excuse me. Sorry.
Excuse me.

482
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:33,208
Wow, four bars in 1945.

483
00:37:33,293 --> 00:37:34,835
- Hello?
- <i>Dad, finally!</i>

484
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,760
I've been studying these
plans to the Archives.

485
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:38,213
Looks like once you get
down the stairwell...

486
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:40,257
Oh, I'm way past
the stairwell, Nicky.

487
00:37:40,342 --> 00:37:42,467
- So you found everyone?
- Sort of.

488
00:37:42,552 --> 00:37:44,472
What is that flibberty-widget
you are talking to?

489
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:46,472
- Who's that?
- It's Amelia Earhart.

490
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:48,222
You found Amelia Earhart?

491
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:49,474
I... Hey!

492
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:51,434
Wait a minute!

493
00:37:51,518 --> 00:37:53,436
Whoa, whoa, whoa, buddy,
what's your hurry?

494
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:54,980
Didn't you hear?
The war's over!

495
00:37:55,065 --> 00:37:56,731
Sorry. These guys
are chasing me.

496
00:37:56,815 --> 00:37:59,652
What? What am I looking at,
Mardi Gras?

497
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:01,235
What unit are you from?

498
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,072
I'm from Brooklyn.

499
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:07,451
What? Are you serious? I'm from Flatbush!
Hey, fellas!

500
00:38:07,577 --> 00:38:09,744
These so-and-so's are trying
to rough up my pal here

501
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:11,163
just 'cause
he's from Brooklyn!

502
00:38:11,246 --> 00:38:12,998
- Thank you!
- You got it! Fight!

503
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:18,420
Hey, mister!
You forgot your...

504
00:38:20,382 --> 00:38:21,715
What the heck
is this thing?

505
00:38:30,934 --> 00:38:33,559
Excuse me.
Mind if I get in here?

506
00:38:38,108 --> 00:38:40,025
Any time you're done,
Mr. Daley.

507
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:42,945
- Call me!
- Thank you for that.

508
00:38:43,028 --> 00:38:45,349
So you're quite the smooth
operator, aren't you, Mr. Daley?

509
00:38:45,572 --> 00:38:46,949
Quick!

510
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:56,708
- That actually worked.
- What's next?

511
00:38:56,793 --> 00:38:59,253
Look, nothing personal, but I'm kind
of in the middle of something here

512
00:38:59,336 --> 00:39:00,838
that's not
really your fight.

513
00:39:00,922 --> 00:39:02,630
It's because I'm a
woman, isn't it?

514
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:06,427
No, it's because I've got this ancient
raised-from-the-dead evil Pharaoh guy

515
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:09,554
who's willing to kill me and probably
anyone near me to get this tablet

516
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:10,889
so he can rule the world.

517
00:39:10,974 --> 00:39:13,016
So it is because
I'm a woman!

518
00:39:13,101 --> 00:39:14,461
- Look, I...
- No, you look, Mr. Daley!

519
00:39:14,476 --> 00:39:16,853
If it weren't for me, you'd still be
lost in that monochromatic mayhem!

520
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:19,356
- Lost in what?
- Black and white photo, you boob!

521
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,608
Now listen, and listen good.
I can help you.

522
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:24,695
I want to help you, and not because
I like you, which so far I don't,

523
00:39:24,778 --> 00:39:28,364
but because I smell adventure,
and, damn it, I want in.

524
00:39:30,492 --> 00:39:32,952
Okay. Don't blame me if
something happens to you.

525
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:34,996
I should be so lucky.

526
00:39:35,914 --> 00:39:40,585
I am Kahmunrah.
I am half god,

527
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:43,838
once removed
on my mother's side,

528
00:39:43,922 --> 00:39:48,469
rightful ruler of Egypt,
future ruler of...

529
00:39:49,471 --> 00:39:51,012
Well, everything else.

530
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:54,182
Now, I have
lost some men.

531
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:59,855
So, I am in need of some new generals
to join me in my little plan

532
00:39:59,938 --> 00:40:01,940
of conquering this world.

533
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:04,193
Ivan the Terrible.

534
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:08,322
Napoleon Bonaparte.

535
00:40:08,405 --> 00:40:10,407
And young Al Capone.

536
00:40:10,492 --> 00:40:11,532
Yeah.

537
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:13,911
Some of the most
despicable,

538
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:17,414
most feared leaders
in all of history.

539
00:40:18,208 --> 00:40:19,583
Gentlemen,

540
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:23,711
really, it's just fantastic
to meet you all.

541
00:40:23,797 --> 00:40:25,297
- And us, too.
- And me, you.

542
00:40:25,715 --> 00:40:27,215
All I ask
is your allegiance,

543
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:30,677
and in return,
I offer you the world.

544
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:33,179
Literally.
Are there any questions?

545
00:40:33,306 --> 00:40:36,182
Yeah, I got one. How come
you're wearing a dress?

546
00:40:36,476 --> 00:40:38,811
This is not a dress.
This is a tunic.

547
00:40:39,311 --> 00:40:42,313
It was the height of fashion
3,000 years ago, I assure you.

548
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:44,108
Are there any
other questions?

549
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:47,945
Da. This dress
you're wearing,

550
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:50,280
do we have to wear
one of these, too?

551
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:54,284
Were you not listening?
I just told Mr. Capone here

552
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:56,036
that this is not a dress.

553
00:40:56,121 --> 00:40:59,789
It is, in fact, a tunic.
Very big difference.

554
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:02,668
Are there any
other questions?

555
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:05,628
Any questions
not about the dress?

556
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,713
Tunic?

557
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:10,384
All right, then.
Moonlight is wasting,

558
00:41:10,467 --> 00:41:11,677
and the time is short.

559
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,969
Short?

560
00:41:13,054 --> 00:41:15,889
Why do you look at me
when you say "short"?

561
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:19,351
Sorry. It slipped out.

562
00:41:21,728 --> 00:41:25,481
Da. If we are talking
about world domination,

563
00:41:25,567 --> 00:41:27,400
then of course,
I am interested.

564
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:31,237
But first I want to clarify something
so you know what you are getting.

565
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:34,907
People always say, "Ivan the
Terrible, he's so terrible."

566
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:37,744
"I'm so scared of Ivan.
He's bad news."

567
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:40,664
When in fact, the
correct translation is.

568
00:41:41,498 --> 00:41:43,583
"Ivan the Awesome."

569
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,335
Ivan the Awesome?

570
00:41:47,422 --> 00:41:49,005
It's not really
as catchy, is it?

571
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:51,925
I mean, "Ivan the Terrible",
that really pops.

572
00:41:52,217 --> 00:41:55,679
But I wasn't terrible. In fact,
I was quite an effective leader.

573
00:41:55,762 --> 00:41:59,432
Duly noted. Now, I'd like to
wrap up the old meet-and-greet

574
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:01,851
by asking you gentlemen
a question.

575
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:04,271
Are you with me?

576
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:06,190
- Yeah. Yeah, sure.
- <i>Oui.</i>

577
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,690
Da, but...

578
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:11,027
Then bring Larry Daley
of Daley Devices

579
00:42:11,112 --> 00:42:14,072
and the Golden Tablet
of Ahkmenrah to me!

580
00:42:17,452 --> 00:42:19,702
We'll get you back
down to your chums, Mr. Daley.

581
00:42:19,786 --> 00:42:22,371
You won't get lost
following Amelia Earhart.

582
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:24,958
Quick, get down.

583
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:31,380
Well, well, Mr. Daley, I quite
like the way you're holding me.

584
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:35,552
No. Sorry,
I wasn't trying to...

585
00:42:35,637 --> 00:42:37,637
Oh, please, stop beating
your gums, Mr. Daley.

586
00:42:37,722 --> 00:42:40,003
You haven't been able to take
your cheaters off my chassis

587
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:41,641
since the moment we met.

588
00:42:41,768 --> 00:42:44,061
I literally didn't
understand one word of that.

589
00:42:48,733 --> 00:42:51,318
Is it just me or is
there music in the air?

590
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:53,987
<i>♪ ...my baby, we can make it shine ♪</i>

591
00:42:54,155 --> 00:42:55,905
<i>♪ We can take forever.. ♪</i>

592
00:42:55,989 --> 00:42:58,824
You! Little flying
angel things! Quiet!

593
00:42:58,952 --> 00:43:01,494
They're cupids, Mr. Daley.
Gods of love.

594
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:03,413
Great. Gods of love,
would you shut up?

595
00:43:03,498 --> 00:43:05,289
Please shut up.
We're trying to hide.

596
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:09,210
<i>♪ Yeah! More than a woman! Yeah! ♪</i>

597
00:43:09,836 --> 00:43:12,380
No, don't change
the arrangement,

598
00:43:12,465 --> 00:43:14,840
it's not about the arrangement.
Quiet! Shh!

599
00:43:15,175 --> 00:43:16,510
<i>♪ Kick the chorus, y'all! ♪</i>

600
00:43:16,635 --> 00:43:18,262
<i>♪ More than a woman ♪</i>

601
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:20,639
<i>♪ Yo, show me what you got, ♪
♪ night guard! ♪</i>

602
00:43:20,722 --> 00:43:22,056
All right, come on.
Let's go.

603
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:24,768
<i>♪ More than a woman to me ♪</i>

604
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:27,353
<i>♪ More than a woman ♪</i>

605
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:29,773
<i>♪ She's more than a woman ♪</i>

606
00:43:35,362 --> 00:43:41,117
And so, the little tiny man who could
not be a smaller or shorter mouse

607
00:43:41,202 --> 00:43:43,202
runs into the claws
of the giant cat!

608
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:46,748
Wow, you're really hung up
on the height, aren't you?

609
00:43:46,873 --> 00:43:48,753
- No, it's not about height, see...
- Yes, you are.

610
00:43:48,793 --> 00:43:50,873
You're saying I'm a little
mouse, you're a giant cat.

611
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:52,545
I am the giant cat.

612
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:53,880
No offense, I just...

613
00:43:54,007 --> 00:43:56,882
You're Napoleon. There's a
complex named after you.

614
00:43:57,010 --> 00:43:59,094
You're famous for being
little, and it's true. Look.

615
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:01,762
Oh, you naive
American man-boy.

616
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:04,724
Look. Neither of us are gonna
be jamming anytime soon, right?

617
00:44:04,851 --> 00:44:07,143
So it's not like we should...
It's not even an issue.

618
00:44:08,353 --> 00:44:09,813
It's not about height
or something else.

619
00:44:09,896 --> 00:44:11,731
It's a plan.
It's a brilliant plan.

620
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:14,943
- So it was a plan.
- Snazzy maneuver, Emperor.

621
00:44:17,195 --> 00:44:18,655
<i>Merci, mademoiselle.</i>

622
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:21,867
Now, if your boyfriend
would kindly come with me...

623
00:44:21,951 --> 00:44:23,367
I'm not her boyfriend.

624
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:27,079
- Not her boyfriend.
- No.

625
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:28,873
Just friends?

626
00:44:29,751 --> 00:44:30,833
Oh.

627
00:44:31,418 --> 00:44:33,378
Yeah, friends.

628
00:44:33,463 --> 00:44:35,547
- Acquaintances. Friends.
- Hmm. Oh.

629
00:44:37,967 --> 00:44:39,634
Were you guys, like,
friends in college

630
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,179
and just afraid now to both
ruin your relationship

631
00:44:42,262 --> 00:44:44,639
by telling the other person that
you want to be more than friends,

632
00:44:44,766 --> 00:44:46,266
that you like-like
each other?

633
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:51,938
One more time? I'm sorry.
I didn't catch the...

634
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:54,440
Were you guys, like,
friends in college

635
00:44:54,567 --> 00:44:56,360
and now both afraid to
ruin your relationship

636
00:44:56,443 --> 00:44:59,195
by telling the other person that
you want to be more than friends,

637
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,322
that you like-like
each other?

638
00:45:02,115 --> 00:45:03,157
Oh...

639
00:45:04,077 --> 00:45:05,827
- No.
- No?

640
00:45:05,952 --> 00:45:07,788
I just love the nitty-gritty
of relationships.

641
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:09,039
All us French do.

642
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:10,664
- Great.
- <i>Yes. Amour!</i>

643
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:12,000
- Now.
- Yeah?

644
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:14,418
- This way, or you die.
- Yes.

645
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:19,882
Wait, I'm coming with you!

646
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:22,135
No! Our fight
is not with you.

647
00:45:25,972 --> 00:45:29,476
...so you gotta bet a second time.
All right. Okay.

648
00:45:29,936 --> 00:45:33,605
My hair is currency
in certain parts of Europe.

649
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:37,192
It's true. Currency,
like gold or paper money.

650
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:40,195
The Duomo was purchased
with just one locket.

651
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,655
Listen up, kemosabe.

652
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:45,574
This rodeo clown wouldn't know
a flapjack from a flyswatter.

653
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:47,952
Now, Gigantor's out there
risking his hide for us.

654
00:45:48,036 --> 00:45:49,996
The least we can do
is give him some help.

655
00:45:50,123 --> 00:45:51,498
Some big help.

656
00:45:51,581 --> 00:45:54,793
But we can't very well do that if
we're stuck in here, now, can we?

657
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:57,211
We need to escape.

658
00:45:58,338 --> 00:45:59,463
What's a flapjack?

659
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:01,967
It's like a biscuit
or a scone.

660
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:03,592
Chest bump?

661
00:46:03,677 --> 00:46:04,969
Yeah.

662
00:46:05,512 --> 00:46:07,304
Then deadly. Watch.

663
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:10,391
Guard your cards, okay?
Now you bet.

664
00:46:10,976 --> 00:46:13,061
Okay, now you got to
throw some cards down.

665
00:46:15,523 --> 00:46:17,398
- Ready?
- Ready.

666
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:19,608
Say something.
Say anything.

667
00:46:19,693 --> 00:46:21,695
This is no fun.
You're supposed to...

668
00:46:23,905 --> 00:46:26,282
- Hey! What are you two doing out here?
- Octavius, go!

669
00:46:26,367 --> 00:46:27,826
You, make a run for it,
I'll hold them off!

670
00:46:27,909 --> 00:46:29,494
I will not leave you!

671
00:46:29,579 --> 00:46:32,873
Ain't no time for your Roman melodrama!
Now, get! Go!

672
00:46:33,331 --> 00:46:34,791
Old Jedediah
will be fine.

673
00:46:34,876 --> 00:46:36,356
Now, you're in real trouble.

674
00:46:40,882 --> 00:46:43,550
Why, these aren't
real rubies at all.

675
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:45,802
Ruby slippers indeed.

676
00:46:47,012 --> 00:46:50,681
But, whoever you are,
Archie Bunker,

677
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:54,018
you had one
comfortable throne.

678
00:46:55,021 --> 00:46:56,313
Hey, boss.

679
00:46:56,396 --> 00:46:59,648
Caught this one trying to escape
through a rust hole in the crate.

680
00:46:59,733 --> 00:47:01,568
One of his little
friends got away.

681
00:47:01,693 --> 00:47:05,197
Oh, please. What damage
could they possibly do?

682
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:09,201
Why, they're no bigger than a little
grain of couscous. Aren't you?

683
00:47:09,284 --> 00:47:11,536
You know, two words come to
mind when I hear you talk.

684
00:47:11,913 --> 00:47:14,079
"Delusional"
and "weirdo".

685
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:18,001
And if I had to say a third, "goofy".
Just goofy.

686
00:47:18,503 --> 00:47:22,005
Now you let old Jedediah out of
here or he's gonna get angry.

687
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:24,007
Well played, Jedediah!

688
00:47:24,090 --> 00:47:27,802
I'm sorry, I can't take
you seriously. You're just adorable,

689
00:47:28,304 --> 00:47:30,514
even when you're threatening me.
It's hilarious.

690
00:47:30,597 --> 00:47:34,726
Is it just me, or are these
guys unbelievably cute?

691
00:47:34,809 --> 00:47:35,936
Now hold it a second, now.

692
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:38,730
Now, you have a right to keep me
as your captive, torture me, even,

693
00:47:38,813 --> 00:47:41,233
but don't call me cute!
I ain't cute!

694
00:47:41,317 --> 00:47:46,362
Steady, my friend! Just stay alive!
I will find you!

695
00:47:51,452 --> 00:47:53,619
Gigantor. No!

696
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:58,500
Hello, Mr. Daley.
Nice to see you again.

697
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:03,713
Now, if you don't mind,
I shall take that from you.

698
00:48:04,297 --> 00:48:05,673
Thank you.

699
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:11,304
Finally. Finally!
After 3,000 years,

700
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:15,099
my evil army
of the damned,

701
00:48:15,184 --> 00:48:18,478
my beautiful,
beautiful army,

702
00:48:18,563 --> 00:48:23,315
shall be unleashed!

703
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:32,784
I'm afraid that.

704
00:48:32,867 --> 00:48:37,496
Mother and Father may have slightly
changed the combination on me.

705
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:40,958
Wow, I guess this whole
unleashing-the-underworld thing

706
00:48:41,043 --> 00:48:43,295
isn't really working
out for you, huh?

707
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:44,545
It must be really
frustrating,

708
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:46,590
'cause you've waited
thousands of years

709
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:48,465
to come back from the
dead and everything,

710
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:51,927
and now you can't
get it open.

711
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:55,889
Fear not, for I shall wait
a thousand more if I must.

712
00:48:56,016 --> 00:49:00,061
Good, 'cause in a few hours you'll be
standing here in a frustrated position,

713
00:49:00,186 --> 00:49:03,773
frozen, and I'll walk out of here
with my buddies and that'll be that.

714
00:49:03,858 --> 00:49:05,025
So, I got all night.

715
00:49:05,568 --> 00:49:08,695
Really? All night? Well!

716
00:49:09,195 --> 00:49:10,697
He doesn't.

717
00:49:19,914 --> 00:49:21,916
Open that cage.

718
00:49:22,043 --> 00:49:23,208
What are you doing?

719
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:25,085
No touching!
No touching!

720
00:49:25,211 --> 00:49:26,630
Don't you manhandle me!

721
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:29,673
- Look, he's having a little tantrum.
- Jed?

722
00:49:29,759 --> 00:49:31,885
Uh-uh! Don't you squirm!

723
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:34,054
Don't squirm.
It'll only be worse for you.

724
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:36,514
- Put him down!
- Don't be afraid.

725
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:38,224
I shan't hurt you.

726
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:40,184
Oops! I lied.

727
00:49:41,936 --> 00:49:45,648
I don't think he has all
night at all, Mr. Daley.

728
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:50,152
From the looks of things, I'd say
he has a little over an hour.

729
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:51,905
Take me out of here!

730
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:57,702
You were the guardian!
You know all about this tablet.

731
00:49:57,786 --> 00:50:00,996
You're obviously much more
clever than the rest of us.

732
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:03,166
You may or may not
know the combination,

733
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:06,503
but I am going to give you exactly
one hour to figure it out.

734
00:50:06,586 --> 00:50:09,547
If you do not, I shall
kill your friends.

735
00:50:09,632 --> 00:50:11,800
And please don't think
about escaping,

736
00:50:11,884 --> 00:50:13,592
for I shall be
watching you.

737
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:15,469
Look, I don't even
know how to begin

738
00:50:15,596 --> 00:50:17,722
to decipher this thing,
all right? Really.

739
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:19,431
What a pity.

740
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:23,353
And your little cowboy friend seemed
like such a charming little fellow.

741
00:50:23,688 --> 00:50:26,856
Ah, well.
Tick-tock, Mr. Daley.

742
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:29,567
Your hour has begun.

743
00:50:29,652 --> 00:50:34,447
Hey! You got this, partner.
I know you do.

744
00:50:37,201 --> 00:50:38,326
Shoo!

745
00:50:41,621 --> 00:50:44,833
You got this!

746
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:53,215
There you are!
Are you all right?

747
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:55,217
I've been worried sick!
Sick I tell you.

748
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:56,552
No, I'm fine.

749
00:50:56,637 --> 00:50:58,054
So what's our next move,
partner?

750
00:50:58,139 --> 00:51:00,806
I don't know. I just got to
get this tablet translated.

751
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:03,893
Oh, great!
This guy again.

752
00:51:03,978 --> 00:51:06,813
Look, buddy, we don't want
any trouble, all right?

753
00:51:17,657 --> 00:51:19,242
Hmm, look at that!

754
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:22,871
I guess our sassy cephalopod was just a
fish who didn't like being out of water.

755
00:51:23,748 --> 00:51:25,706
He's not such a
ballywagger after all.

756
00:51:29,711 --> 00:51:31,963
Okay. Glad you're happy.

757
00:51:41,474 --> 00:51:43,766
Hello?
A little assistance?

758
00:51:44,018 --> 00:51:46,603
- Oh! Hey, Teddy! Perfect!
- Yes!

759
00:51:46,686 --> 00:51:47,811
Maybe you could help us.

760
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:49,481
I'd love to help you,
but first things first.

761
00:51:49,565 --> 00:51:51,900
My nose is so itchy,
it's driving me insane.

762
00:51:52,025 --> 00:51:53,693
I hate to ask,
but, as you see,

763
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:55,277
I'm missing
a few body parts.

764
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:57,362
Could you please
give us a scratch?

765
00:51:57,447 --> 00:51:58,572
Yeah, sure.

766
00:51:59,532 --> 00:52:02,577
Oh, yes! That's exquisite.
Oh! A little over there...

767
00:52:02,702 --> 00:52:03,869
- Yes!
- More?

768
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:06,206
Oh, yes! Yes!
Oh, that's...

769
00:52:06,916 --> 00:52:09,458
Sweet rutabaga pie,
that was divine.

770
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,543
Theodore Roosevelt,
at your service.

771
00:52:11,878 --> 00:52:14,463
Twenty-sixth President of the
United States, Rough Rider,

772
00:52:14,547 --> 00:52:17,027
founder of the national parks, and
a whole bunch of other stuff.

773
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:18,217
Have we met?

774
00:52:18,302 --> 00:52:20,719
Oh, no,
there's another Teddy.

775
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:22,137
We have one of you
in New York.

776
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:25,391
Really? What's he like,
this other me?

777
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:28,686
He's pretty much
the same, except with...

778
00:52:28,771 --> 00:52:30,855
Except what? Say it.
Except with a body?

779
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:32,148
Yes. He has a body.

780
00:52:32,233 --> 00:52:33,398
Oh, dash it, the pain!

781
00:52:33,983 --> 00:52:35,818
- And a horse.
- Excuse me!

782
00:52:35,902 --> 00:52:38,570
We really need someone to translate
what's written on this tablet.

783
00:52:38,947 --> 00:52:40,405
Do you read
hieroglyphics?

784
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:42,157
Yes, I do, missy.

785
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:43,992
That's a simple one.

786
00:52:44,077 --> 00:52:48,121
Bird. Man with spear. Sideways fish.
Beetle. Vase.

787
00:52:48,998 --> 00:52:50,833
Okay, and what
does that mean?

788
00:52:50,918 --> 00:52:54,003
It means, and this is
just a rough translation,

789
00:52:54,922 --> 00:52:59,007
"A man with a spear trapped a bird
and a sideways fish in a vase."

790
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:03,012
"And there was
also a beetle."

791
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:06,224
I don't think that's it.

792
00:53:06,307 --> 00:53:08,016
That's just one
possible translation.

793
00:53:08,101 --> 00:53:09,643
Another possible
translation is,

794
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:11,688
"You will find the
combination you seek"

795
00:53:11,771 --> 00:53:15,608
"if you figure out the secret at
the heart of Pharaoh's tomb."

796
00:53:15,985 --> 00:53:17,610
Okay, and what
does that mean?

797
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:18,820
I don't know!
What am I, the Sphinx?

798
00:53:18,903 --> 00:53:21,114
"What's this? What's that?"
Why don't you ask New York Teddy?

799
00:53:21,197 --> 00:53:23,574
I'm sure he'd love to get his grabby
little fingers all over that thing!

800
00:53:23,659 --> 00:53:25,284
Probably let his
horse lick it, too!

801
00:53:25,369 --> 00:53:27,744
Mr. Daley, we should be going
to the sculpture gallery.

802
00:53:27,829 --> 00:53:30,590
I think there's someone there who
might have a better thought on this.

803
00:53:30,791 --> 00:53:32,708
The fellow we're looking
for is just down here.

804
00:53:32,793 --> 00:53:33,793
<i>Bonsoir.</i>

805
00:53:33,878 --> 00:53:36,128
Hello, young lady.

806
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:39,715
Hey, excuse me. Could
we keep moving, please?

807
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:42,844
We certainly could, but then we
might miss a rare opportunity.

808
00:53:42,969 --> 00:53:45,471
I mean,
she is a Degas, Mr. Daley.

809
00:53:45,556 --> 00:53:47,724
Okay, it's just I got a little
buddy stuck in an hourglass,

810
00:53:47,807 --> 00:53:49,559
I got a pitch meeting
at Wal-Mart in the morning...

811
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:51,311
It would be great
if we could...

812
00:53:51,394 --> 00:53:53,021
He's right here.

813
00:53:53,898 --> 00:53:55,940
I think he'll have
a thought on this.

814
00:53:56,025 --> 00:53:58,775
Mr. Thinker, we're sorry to
interrupt your contemplation,

815
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:01,070
but we really need to
figure out the secret

816
00:54:01,155 --> 00:54:03,280
at the heart
of Pharaoh's tomb.

817
00:54:03,364 --> 00:54:06,534
I'm thinking.
I'm thinking.

818
00:54:07,994 --> 00:54:09,536
I'm thinking.

819
00:54:10,496 --> 00:54:12,998
I'm thinking.

820
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:14,918
It's not happening with him.

821
00:54:15,628 --> 00:54:16,920
Oh, wow.

822
00:54:17,003 --> 00:54:20,380
You've gotta be
kidding me. Check that out!

823
00:54:21,717 --> 00:54:23,009
Oh, yeah.

824
00:54:23,092 --> 00:54:24,344
Hey! Hey!

825
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:26,094
Buddy! Over here!
This is serious.

826
00:54:26,179 --> 00:54:28,014
Apparently, it's a matter
of life and death.

827
00:54:28,389 --> 00:54:30,269
I'll tell you what's a
matter of life and death.

828
00:54:30,351 --> 00:54:32,018
That beautiful lady
over there.

829
00:54:32,101 --> 00:54:35,563
Hey, baby! Check out the gun
show going on over here!

830
00:54:35,648 --> 00:54:36,981
Boom! Bang!

831
00:54:37,065 --> 00:54:38,608
Firepower!

832
00:54:39,025 --> 00:54:41,068
He's certainly
no Einstein.

833
00:54:41,195 --> 00:54:43,987
- Biceps! Deltoids...
- Yeah.

834
00:54:44,072 --> 00:54:46,157
Wait a minute.
I saw a bunch of those.

835
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:47,324
A bunch of whats?

836
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:49,202
- Little Einsteins.
- Where?

837
00:54:50,244 --> 00:54:52,246
Over there,
in Air and Space.

838
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:54,873
I gotta get over there.

839
00:54:55,376 --> 00:54:56,501
What?

840
00:54:56,585 --> 00:54:58,126
Nothing.

841
00:54:58,211 --> 00:55:00,088
Okay. Then why are you
staring at me?

842
00:55:00,713 --> 00:55:02,422
I don't wanna
miss a moment.

843
00:55:02,548 --> 00:55:04,175
All right, good, but we should
get going, 'cause we...

844
00:55:06,052 --> 00:55:08,512
- Why?
- You talk too much, ace.

845
00:55:13,559 --> 00:55:14,936
I don't know why
I did that, Mr. Daley.

846
00:55:15,061 --> 00:55:18,146
I just feel as if I've been asleep
for a long time and now, suddenly,

847
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:19,773
I'm awake.

848
00:55:20,067 --> 00:55:21,900
I can explain that...

849
00:55:22,777 --> 00:55:24,112
But really, I could.
I really...

850
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:26,989
Again, why?

851
00:55:32,246 --> 00:55:33,579
Great, you're back.

852
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:40,545
Okay. Yeah. Great.

853
00:55:40,628 --> 00:55:43,755
Love theme from Titanic. Good,
but not really appropriate.

854
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:50,304
You don't let yourself enjoy
things much, do you, Mr. Daley?

855
00:55:51,431 --> 00:55:54,349
Okay, you know what?
It's not really the song choice.

856
00:55:54,434 --> 00:55:56,268
And by the way,
you're a little pitchy.

857
00:55:56,394 --> 00:55:59,480
Well, I thought you were
amazing, and you look wonderful.

858
00:56:01,150 --> 00:56:03,067
Could you just
fly away, please?

859
00:56:03,902 --> 00:56:05,652
And so the adventure
continues.

860
00:56:08,614 --> 00:56:11,826
What did I tell you? Enough!

861
00:56:19,043 --> 00:56:24,297
You know, I do sort of feel
like a floating butterfly.

862
00:56:24,757 --> 00:56:27,257
You are crazier
than a road lizard.

863
00:56:27,342 --> 00:56:31,387
Mr. Egypt, these two here heard
that we're taking over the world

864
00:56:31,472 --> 00:56:34,431
and they want in.
I don't know who they are,

865
00:56:34,516 --> 00:56:37,893
but they're on exhibit here,
too, apparently.

866
00:56:38,771 --> 00:56:40,938
I don't even know
what they are.

867
00:56:41,023 --> 00:56:46,152
I'm sorry, but we're all full up
in our axis of evil today. Sorry.

868
00:56:46,235 --> 00:56:49,405
Come on! But I'm bad! I'm bad!

869
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:51,782
Hey, I could show you
how bad I am!

870
00:56:53,452 --> 00:56:55,119
Fear me!

871
00:56:57,206 --> 00:56:58,873
I'm sorry.
I'm just not buying it.

872
00:56:58,956 --> 00:57:03,376
You don't seem very bad. You just
seem sort of vaguely grouchy to me.

873
00:57:04,295 --> 00:57:05,670
Oh, boy.

874
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:10,050
What are you doing? What is that?
What is this?

875
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:12,385
What does it mean?
You've lost me.

876
00:57:12,471 --> 00:57:16,139
Is that you breathing?
Because I can't hear myself think.

877
00:57:16,849 --> 00:57:19,893
Can I make one suggestion to
you, my friend? Just simplify.

878
00:57:19,978 --> 00:57:22,396
There's just too much
going on here.

879
00:57:22,481 --> 00:57:25,273
You're evil, you're
asthmatic, you're a robot...

880
00:57:25,358 --> 00:57:26,983
And what is the cape for?

881
00:57:27,068 --> 00:57:29,653
Are we going to the opera?
I don't think so.

882
00:57:29,737 --> 00:57:31,864
Sorry! Goodbye.

883
00:57:31,949 --> 00:57:33,490
<i>Attention!</i>

884
00:57:33,574 --> 00:57:35,451
He's leaving
with the tablet!

885
00:57:36,161 --> 00:57:37,702
Where?

886
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:40,498
Give me that.

887
00:57:41,041 --> 00:57:45,085
He's not trying to figure out the...
He's trying to escape!

888
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:49,215
Go. Go! All of you! Kill him!
And bring me that tablet.

889
00:57:49,465 --> 00:57:53,010
Come on, people! Let's go!
Without that tablet, we've nothing!

890
00:57:53,094 --> 00:57:54,846
<i>Streltsy! Go!</i>

891
00:57:57,431 --> 00:58:00,851
Thought you could get away,
didn't you, Larry Daley?

892
00:58:09,277 --> 00:58:10,862
Criminy,
we're jimmy-jacked.

893
00:58:10,945 --> 00:58:13,072
- Jimmy-jacked? Really?
- It's the way I speak.

894
00:58:13,157 --> 00:58:15,407
Yeah, I know, but that one
sounds made up, even for you.

895
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:19,579
"Oh, no, our path has been blocked by
bad people." What's the fun in that?

896
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:22,373
The point is, we're not getting
into the Air and Space right now.

897
00:58:22,498 --> 00:58:24,541
- You're right. We are jimmy-jacked.
- Jimmy-jacked.

898
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:26,376
Come on.

899
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:38,681
They say a good
man rules this union.

900
00:58:39,266 --> 00:58:41,601
I promised Jedediah
I would bring help,

901
00:58:42,143 --> 00:58:44,103
and help I will bring.

902
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:50,943
Charge!

903
00:59:03,956 --> 00:59:05,875
Misjudged the distance.

904
00:59:09,755 --> 00:59:11,172
Who's there?

905
00:59:17,054 --> 00:59:18,679
Jupiter, protect me.

906
00:59:23,434 --> 00:59:26,478
Remain very still.

907
00:59:27,188 --> 00:59:29,481
They can sense movement.

908
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:34,445
Apparently, they can also
hear me talking to myself.

909
00:59:36,907 --> 00:59:38,657
I'm not a nut.

910
00:59:40,327 --> 00:59:41,952
No!

911
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:50,920
We should be okay
in here for a while.

912
00:59:55,967 --> 00:59:58,219
So, how long have
you guarded antiquities?

913
00:59:58,302 --> 01:00:00,972
What? Oh, no, I don't
actually work at the...

914
01:00:01,056 --> 01:00:02,936
I just thought with
the fancy getup and all...

915
01:00:03,557 --> 01:00:05,059
No, I borrowed this.

916
01:00:05,559 --> 01:00:10,106
I mean, I was a guard back in New
York, but that was a while ago.

917
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:14,150
So why did you leave?
Did you not enjoy it?

918
01:00:14,235 --> 01:00:15,860
No, I loved it.
I just...

919
01:00:15,945 --> 01:00:18,822
Things sort of took off in a
different direction, so...

920
01:00:18,907 --> 01:00:20,992
So what do you do now?

921
01:00:21,076 --> 01:00:22,367
Well, I sort of...

922
01:00:23,327 --> 01:00:26,121
Well, I sort of design
products and sell them.

923
01:00:26,539 --> 01:00:28,331
- You're an inventor!
- I am.

924
01:00:28,416 --> 01:00:30,293
I am an inventor, yeah.
I invent stuff.

925
01:00:30,543 --> 01:00:32,085
Like the rocket ship?

926
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:33,838
- No.
- The sea plane.

927
01:00:33,922 --> 01:00:35,005
The dirigible?

928
01:00:35,090 --> 01:00:36,715
No, not aircraft.

929
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:39,592
Sort of like more
small-scale stuff, like...

930
01:00:39,927 --> 01:00:43,889
Well, the Glow-in-the-Dark
Flashlight, that was mine.

931
01:00:45,891 --> 01:00:47,601
So this new job,
do you like it?

932
01:00:48,186 --> 01:00:51,771
Yeah, I like it a lot.
It's exciting. It's...

933
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:55,693
- What?
- I'm just confused, is all.

934
01:00:55,777 --> 01:00:57,987
If you're not excited by
it, why do you do it?

935
01:00:58,487 --> 01:01:00,655
I am excited by it.
I just said...

936
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:02,199
I know what you said,
Mr. Daley,

937
01:01:02,284 --> 01:01:05,619
but what I see in front of me
is a man who's lost his moxie.

938
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:09,081
I have not lost my...

939
01:01:09,416 --> 01:01:11,250
I got my moxie.

940
01:01:11,585 --> 01:01:13,126
Do you know
why I became a pilot?

941
01:01:14,795 --> 01:01:16,088
I don't, no.

942
01:01:16,172 --> 01:01:17,672
For the fun of it.

943
01:01:18,717 --> 01:01:20,675
Why else would
anyone do anything?

944
01:01:24,306 --> 01:01:25,806
Great Gatsby!

945
01:01:27,391 --> 01:01:30,894
Blast these pigeons and
their incessant cooing!

946
01:01:31,021 --> 01:01:33,898
- No! Mr. President! Sir!
- All right. Time to see the state...

947
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:37,275
- Please don't get up!
- ...Of this great union! I always say,

948
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:41,072
leave nothing for tomorrow
which can be done today.

949
01:01:41,155 --> 01:01:43,199
Sir, if you go out there, you're
gonna freak a lot of people out!

950
01:01:43,282 --> 01:01:47,077
Freak? I assure you, sir,
I am no freak.

951
01:01:47,161 --> 01:01:49,371
No, I didn't mean
you're a freak...

952
01:01:49,456 --> 01:01:51,581
Come here, little one.

953
01:01:52,458 --> 01:01:55,710
In fact, if anyone is freakish,
I'm afraid it's you, sir.

954
01:01:56,213 --> 01:01:59,047
The truth is,
you are very small.

955
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:01,842
And I mean even for
a regular-sized human.

956
01:02:01,927 --> 01:02:04,677
What? Why would you
even say that?

957
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:06,722
I must be honest.

958
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:10,601
Right. Okay, Honest Abe.
Of course. I'm sorry. Great.

959
01:02:10,684 --> 01:02:12,978
Come, now, Mr. President,
put the little man down

960
01:02:13,063 --> 01:02:15,313
and let's sit our fanny back
in that throne of yours.

961
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:18,900
You have a can-do attitude,
and I shall do as you ask.

962
01:02:18,985 --> 01:02:20,610
- Thank you.
- Mmm-hmm.

963
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:22,780
- There you go.
- Thank you.

964
01:02:22,864 --> 01:02:27,284
It's that very can-do spirit that has
defined this remarkable nation of ours.

965
01:02:27,369 --> 01:02:28,869
- Interesting story.
- They're coming.

966
01:02:28,954 --> 01:02:30,246
One night in Gettysburg...

967
01:02:30,329 --> 01:02:32,081
Mr. President, we're gonna
need you to hold still now.

968
01:02:32,164 --> 01:02:33,916
- What?
- Abraham, freeze!

969
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,793
Freeze? I...

970
01:02:43,050 --> 01:02:45,135
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

971
01:02:45,219 --> 01:02:47,721
- Come on, let's get to Air and Space.
- If I may,

972
01:02:47,806 --> 01:02:49,974
you two make
an adorable couple.

973
01:02:50,057 --> 01:02:51,224
Oh, no, we're not...

974
01:02:51,309 --> 01:02:52,976
No, we're not a...
I mean, we're not a...

975
01:02:53,061 --> 01:02:55,438
"We're not a...
I mean, we're not a..."

976
01:02:55,521 --> 01:02:57,898
Blah, blah, blah.
I never lie!

977
01:02:58,233 --> 01:03:01,777
The truth is, you two
are adorable together.

978
01:03:01,862 --> 01:03:03,320
Thank you. Good night.

979
01:03:03,405 --> 01:03:08,867
Farewell, lovely lady
and small, little man.

980
01:03:10,494 --> 01:03:13,246
Now let's see if we can
find these Einsteins of yours.

981
01:03:30,556 --> 01:03:33,016
<i>One giant leap</i>
<i>for a mannequin...</i>

982
01:03:33,726 --> 01:03:35,728
<i>D.C., this is Air and Space.</i>

983
01:03:35,811 --> 01:03:38,731
<i>We are back online</i>
<i>and fully operational.</i>

984
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:47,864
The Tuskegee Airmen are
on the march once again.

985
01:03:47,949 --> 01:03:51,952
Can you stop narrating everything
we're doing? Just live in the moment.

986
01:03:52,496 --> 01:03:55,581
The Tuskegee Airmen are
living in the moment!

987
01:03:55,664 --> 01:03:57,081
- Miss Earhart?
- Yes.

988
01:03:57,166 --> 01:03:58,208
I wanna say thank you.

989
01:03:58,293 --> 01:03:59,335
What for, Captain?

990
01:03:59,418 --> 01:04:01,711
A lot of people didn't think
we could fly, either.

991
01:04:01,795 --> 01:04:03,963
Thanks for clearing
the runway, ma'am.

992
01:04:07,469 --> 01:04:08,510
Race you to Paris?

993
01:04:08,594 --> 01:04:09,719
You're on!

994
01:04:09,804 --> 01:04:11,137
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey!
No! Not now! We gotta...

995
01:04:11,222 --> 01:04:13,474
- It's just a quick jaunt over the pond.
- No. Gotta find the Einsteins.

996
01:04:13,557 --> 01:04:16,643
Come on, we gotta go.
We don't have time. Come on!

997
01:04:16,728 --> 01:04:19,063
Sorry, it's in the blood.

998
01:04:19,773 --> 01:04:21,398
There she is, Mr. Daley.

999
01:04:21,483 --> 01:04:23,692
Old Bessie,
the old family bus.

1000
01:04:23,777 --> 01:04:25,110
That gal took me
across the Atlantic!

1001
01:04:25,195 --> 01:04:27,155
Okay. I think the Einsteins
are over here, though.

1002
01:04:27,239 --> 01:04:29,907
<i>This is Mission Control.
Flight check complete.</i>

1003
01:04:29,990 --> 01:04:32,492
- Where'd you go? Where'd they go?
- <i>You are clear for launch.</i>

1004
01:04:32,577 --> 01:04:34,036
Contact!

1005
01:04:34,119 --> 01:04:36,038
<i>D.C., this is Mission Control.</i>

1006
01:04:36,789 --> 01:04:39,916
No, no! No! <i>All systems go
and green for lift-off.</i>

1007
01:04:40,001 --> 01:04:42,460
<i>Roger that.</i>
<i>We are green for lift-off.</i>

1008
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:45,297
No, we're definitely not green
for any kind of lift-off!

1009
01:04:45,382 --> 01:04:47,090
I want a "go,
no-go" for launch.

1010
01:04:47,175 --> 01:04:49,175
I say no-go.
Let's not go.

1011
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:50,344
Go!

1012
01:04:50,929 --> 01:04:52,387
Go!

1013
01:04:53,139 --> 01:04:55,139
- Go!
- No! No go!

1014
01:04:55,724 --> 01:04:57,434
<i>Torquing angles incoming.</i>

1015
01:04:57,518 --> 01:04:59,603
Tone it down with the torque.
Torque it down.

1016
01:04:59,688 --> 01:05:01,271
De-torque. De-torque.

1017
01:05:03,148 --> 01:05:04,983
Commence ignition sequence.

1018
01:05:05,068 --> 01:05:06,068
Roger that, flight.

1019
01:05:06,152 --> 01:05:07,610
We have launch commit.

1020
01:05:07,695 --> 01:05:09,862
- No. No, no, no!
<i>-  Ten,</i>

1021
01:05:09,947 --> 01:05:12,199
<i>nine, eight, seven...</i>

1022
01:05:12,284 --> 01:05:14,367
- Hey, that's mine.
- <i>No, we do not have commit.</i>

1023
01:05:14,452 --> 01:05:17,371
<i>Repeat. We are decommissioning
the committal of the launch</i>

1024
01:05:17,454 --> 01:05:20,416
<i>and it is now</i>
<i>a negatory launch phase.</i>

1025
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:23,126
<i>We are in a no-fly,</i>
<i>no-go phase.</i>

1026
01:05:23,210 --> 01:05:27,922
<i>That is a November-Gorgon</i>
<i>phase of non-flying!</i>

1027
01:05:28,007 --> 01:05:28,382
Fine!

1028
01:05:28,407 --> 01:05:29,907
<i>And we're gonna say good night.</i>

1029
01:05:29,967 --> 01:05:32,510
<i>Thank you. Good work.</i>
<i>Over and out.</i>

1030
01:05:33,847 --> 01:05:35,764
- Sorry.
- Damn, that was disappointing.

1031
01:05:35,849 --> 01:05:37,807
Come on.
I'll buy you a cup of coffee.

1032
01:05:37,891 --> 01:05:40,436
Hey, little space monkey.

1033
01:05:43,315 --> 01:05:46,233
You're Able. Okay, good.
How you doing?

1034
01:05:46,358 --> 01:05:48,735
Yes, good.
At ease. All right.

1035
01:05:49,737 --> 01:05:52,989
You're a polite little
fella, aren't you?

1036
01:05:53,074 --> 01:05:56,201
Hey, you happen to know where those
little Einstein bobblehead guys are?

1037
01:05:57,494 --> 01:05:59,996
Mr. Daley!
I found your Einsteins.

1038
01:06:00,664 --> 01:06:01,914
Great. Hey...

1039
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,628
Gentlemen, we're trying to crack the
combination of this tablet doodad,

1040
01:06:05,711 --> 01:06:08,213
and the writing here
says we'll find it

1041
01:06:08,297 --> 01:06:11,759
if we figure out the secret at
the heart of Pharaoh's tomb.

1042
01:06:13,762 --> 01:06:16,597
That's an easy one.
The answer's in the question.

1043
01:06:17,097 --> 01:06:18,931
- What does that mean?
- "Figure out".

1044
01:06:19,016 --> 01:06:21,601
It's a figure!
I.E., a number.

1045
01:06:21,686 --> 01:06:24,521
And the Pharaoh's tomb,
I.E. the pyramids.

1046
01:06:24,606 --> 01:06:27,190
Don't you get it, kid?
You're looking for the secret number

1047
01:06:27,275 --> 01:06:29,150
at the heart
of the pyramids.

1048
01:06:29,652 --> 01:06:31,945
Well, whistle me Dixie,
the answer's pi!

1049
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:35,865
- Pi?
- 3.14159265, to be exact.

1050
01:06:35,949 --> 01:06:39,036
Yes! 3.1495265.

1051
01:06:39,119 --> 01:06:42,206
No, no, no,
3.14159265.

1052
01:06:42,289 --> 01:06:44,375
Yeah, okay, 3.14...

1053
01:06:45,043 --> 01:06:47,460
I'm sorry, I can't tell. Is it yes or no?
Cause you just...

1054
01:06:47,545 --> 01:06:49,253
I know it's hard,
could you just...

1055
01:06:49,338 --> 01:06:50,672
Don't touch the hair.

1056
01:06:50,757 --> 01:06:52,507
Sorry, I can't tell
if it's up or...

1057
01:06:52,592 --> 01:06:54,342
I'm a bobblehead, dummkopf,

1058
01:06:54,427 --> 01:06:56,512
and that's the way, uh-huh,
uh-huh, we like it.

1059
01:06:56,596 --> 01:06:57,596
All together, now!

1060
01:06:57,681 --> 01:06:59,481
<i>♪ That's the way, uh-huh, uh-huh ♪</i>

1061
01:06:59,556 --> 01:07:00,556
<i>♪ We like it ♪</i>

1062
01:07:00,641 --> 01:07:01,724
<i>♪ Uh-huh, uh-huh ♪</i>

1063
01:07:01,809 --> 01:07:03,811
You know, we can't all
be Einsteins, so...

1064
01:07:03,894 --> 01:07:05,061
- I can!
- We are!

1065
01:07:05,146 --> 01:07:06,688
- He is!
- Me, too!

1066
01:07:06,773 --> 01:07:08,565
- Okay, all right.
- Okay, here it is.

1067
01:07:08,650 --> 01:07:11,110
- Can you slow it down a little bit?
- Okay.

1068
01:07:11,193 --> 01:07:14,362
3.14159265.

1069
01:07:14,447 --> 01:07:16,155
Okay. 3.14...

1070
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:17,324
I've got it.

1071
01:07:17,574 --> 01:07:19,492
- Thank you, Mr. Einsteins.
- Thank you.

1072
01:07:20,786 --> 01:07:22,246
All right. Now,

1073
01:07:22,329 --> 01:07:26,333
like the brilliant and
famous general that I am,

1074
01:07:26,418 --> 01:07:28,501
I thought long and hard
about what you said,

1075
01:07:28,585 --> 01:07:32,588
and I've come up with a brand-new
and improved battle plan!

1076
01:07:35,009 --> 01:07:36,385
Okay.

1077
01:07:37,637 --> 01:07:41,639
I will loudly announce
that we are not

1078
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:44,601
going to attack,
and then...

1079
01:07:45,478 --> 01:07:46,936
Wait for it.

1080
01:07:47,021 --> 01:07:51,233
"What's the amazing Custer about to say
now? I hope he's my friend, or..."

1081
01:07:51,317 --> 01:07:53,985
We attack!

1082
01:07:57,949 --> 01:08:01,534
Didn't expect your friend to
run off like that, did you?

1083
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:04,246
He's coming back,
Ka-Ka-Ro.

1084
01:08:04,329 --> 01:08:08,125
Sure as moon shines on a
mongoose, he'll be here.

1085
01:08:08,376 --> 01:08:11,420
I would save my
breath if I were you.

1086
01:08:11,503 --> 01:08:13,672
You don't have
many left.

1087
01:08:16,717 --> 01:08:19,177
We've got about 10 minutes
to get over there to Jed.

1088
01:08:19,261 --> 01:08:22,096
I think we make a good team,
perhaps more than a team.

1089
01:08:22,181 --> 01:08:24,182
Um, wait, wait, wait.
Okay, wait.

1090
01:08:24,266 --> 01:08:26,027
What's the matter?
You didn't like kissing me?

1091
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:29,979
No, I did. It was great. I mean, the
slapping hurt a little bit, but...

1092
01:08:30,064 --> 01:08:32,106
So you don't
like me, then.

1093
01:08:32,192 --> 01:08:34,443
Of course I like you.
You're incredible.

1094
01:08:34,527 --> 01:08:36,862
I think you're an amazing person.
You're...

1095
01:08:36,945 --> 01:08:40,865
It's just there are certain issues
that would prevent us from...

1096
01:08:40,949 --> 01:08:43,409
I just... You're not...

1097
01:08:43,494 --> 01:08:45,203
I'm not what, Mr. Daley?

1098
01:08:48,041 --> 01:08:51,042
Okay. You're made of...

1099
01:08:52,377 --> 01:08:53,753
Made of...

1100
01:09:03,347 --> 01:09:06,975
Wonderful things. You're made
of good, wonderful things.

1101
01:09:13,024 --> 01:09:14,190
Come on.

1102
01:09:18,654 --> 01:09:20,988
Gentlemen, could you
buy us some time please?

1103
01:09:27,329 --> 01:09:28,663
It'll have to do.

1104
01:09:30,207 --> 01:09:33,001
No! That's the
first plane ever made!

1105
01:09:33,086 --> 01:09:35,753
It's made out of
balsa wood and paper.

1106
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:37,296
It's made out of
spruce and canvas

1107
01:09:37,381 --> 01:09:39,382
and good old-fashioned
American ingenuity.

1108
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:41,969
Are you coming, or what?

1109
01:09:46,515 --> 01:09:48,725
Out of our way!

1110
01:09:48,810 --> 01:09:49,935
I don't think so.

1111
01:09:51,688 --> 01:09:53,020
They're getting away!

1112
01:09:57,150 --> 01:10:00,319
Hang on, Mr. Daley. Things are
about to get interesting.

1113
01:10:07,787 --> 01:10:10,079
A lady pilot!
Preposterous!

1114
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:11,914
Think again, boys!

1115
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,457
Oh, she's good.

1116
01:10:30,518 --> 01:10:33,145
- Uh-oh.
- What? What? What uh-oh?

1117
01:10:33,229 --> 01:10:35,396
One of the wires is jammed.
I'm going to have to loosen it.

1118
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:37,690
- Here, take the stick!
- No! I'm not gonna... No!

1119
01:10:37,774 --> 01:10:39,318
I know you've got
moxie in you yet.

1120
01:10:39,402 --> 01:10:42,988
Moxie doesn't fly planes! People who
have pilots' licenses fly planes!

1121
01:10:43,072 --> 01:10:44,614
- Okay.
- She's all yours.

1122
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:48,993
I don't want it!
I don't want the stick!

1123
01:10:52,873 --> 01:10:55,542
Don't look now, Mr. Daley,
but you're flying an airplane!

1124
01:11:07,095 --> 01:11:08,764
Able! The doors!

1125
01:11:25,113 --> 01:11:27,698
- Got it!
- Pull!

1126
01:11:30,953 --> 01:11:32,287
Pull up!

1127
01:11:38,418 --> 01:11:39,418
Yes!

1128
01:11:39,628 --> 01:11:41,337
Godspeed, Amelia Earhart!

1129
01:11:41,421 --> 01:11:42,838
Godspeed.

1130
01:12:21,462 --> 01:12:23,755
Look a little
nervous there, Ramen Noodle.

1131
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:26,048
'Cause for me, this is like
a spa treatment.

1132
01:12:26,426 --> 01:12:30,636
Sand baths are really rejuvenating
for the skin. Exfoliates.

1133
01:12:31,389 --> 01:12:32,764
Giving up yet?

1134
01:12:32,931 --> 01:12:34,765
Not quite yet, no.

1135
01:12:35,435 --> 01:12:39,604
In fact, let's see
if we can't make time fly.

1136
01:12:45,569 --> 01:12:47,237
What is that funny sound?

1137
01:13:08,967 --> 01:13:10,594
Stop!

1138
01:13:11,762 --> 01:13:14,139
Right there, please,
Mr. Daley.

1139
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:16,349
Well. Well, well, well!

1140
01:13:17,435 --> 01:13:18,935
You certainly know how to
make an entrance, Mr. Daley.

1141
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:20,436
Time to recruit
some backup.

1142
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:22,980
I hope for your little
friend's sake, here,

1143
01:13:23,065 --> 01:13:25,442
that you also figured out
the combination.

1144
01:13:25,525 --> 01:13:27,069
- Give me Jed.
- Oh, no, no, no.

1145
01:13:27,153 --> 01:13:29,904
First, give me the combination
and hand over that tablet.

1146
01:13:29,988 --> 01:13:31,614
I'll give you the tablet
and the combination

1147
01:13:31,698 --> 01:13:33,365
when you release my friends
and give him back to me.

1148
01:13:33,493 --> 01:13:37,328
I shall release what I want to release
the moment I want to release it.

1149
01:13:37,412 --> 01:13:39,038
Great. And I'll release
what I want to release

1150
01:13:39,122 --> 01:13:40,832
at the exact moment that I
want to release it, okay?

1151
01:13:40,917 --> 01:13:43,627
Tell me the combination and
give me that tablet right now

1152
01:13:43,711 --> 01:13:45,670
or I shall kill
all of your friends,

1153
01:13:45,755 --> 01:13:48,547
starting with the little
shaggy-headed little cowman here.

1154
01:13:48,632 --> 01:13:52,010
I ain't shaggy-headed! Gigantor,
let me take this guy!

1155
01:13:52,095 --> 01:13:54,720
Don't worry, I got this handled.
You don't want to give me my friends,

1156
01:13:54,805 --> 01:13:56,640
then you're not gonna get your
combination or your tablet.

1157
01:13:56,765 --> 01:13:58,182
- All right, I'll tell you what.
- Good.

1158
01:13:58,266 --> 01:14:01,144
They didn't call me Kahmunrah
the Trustworthy for nothing.

1159
01:14:01,229 --> 01:14:03,896
Here you go. They didn't call
me Kahmunrah the Trustworthy!

1160
01:14:03,980 --> 01:14:05,899
They called me Kahmunrah
the Bloodthirsty,

1161
01:14:05,983 --> 01:14:09,610
who kills whoever doesn't give
Kahmunrah exactly what he wants

1162
01:14:09,694 --> 01:14:12,029
in the moment that he wants
it, which is right now,

1163
01:14:12,114 --> 01:14:15,324
when I had also better get the
combination and the tablet!

1164
01:14:16,368 --> 01:14:17,577
That's what
they called you?

1165
01:14:17,662 --> 01:14:18,912
It was shorter
in Egyptian.

1166
01:14:18,996 --> 01:14:20,704
Great, I'll give you the combination
after you give him back.

1167
01:14:20,789 --> 01:14:23,833
How dare you? If you touch that
again, I shall kill you right now.

1168
01:14:23,917 --> 01:14:25,543
- Okay.
- Do not touch this.

1169
01:14:25,627 --> 01:14:26,837
This is a no-touching zone!

1170
01:14:26,921 --> 01:14:28,462
Good. Well, then...

1171
01:14:28,547 --> 01:14:32,591
Oh, my God! I can't believe you
reached across like that again!

1172
01:14:32,676 --> 01:14:36,095
I can't even believe it!
Oh, God, I want to kill you right...

1173
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:38,055
If you didn't know
this combination,

1174
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:39,890
you'd be so dead
right now,

1175
01:14:39,975 --> 01:14:41,268
it would be
unbelievable.

1176
01:14:41,351 --> 01:14:42,978
Great, but I do know
the combination.

1177
01:14:43,186 --> 01:14:47,149
Don't cross this line
with your hand!

1178
01:14:47,233 --> 01:14:53,154
How dare you! If you speak
again, I'm going to kill you.

1179
01:14:53,238 --> 01:14:54,738
Do you understand this?

1180
01:14:54,823 --> 01:14:56,664
Don't say it! Oh, God,
I see you getting ready.

1181
01:14:56,783 --> 01:14:58,909
- I wasn't gonna say anything.
- Oh, my God, don't say anything.

1182
01:14:58,994 --> 01:15:01,121
I shall murder you
if you talk again.

1183
01:15:01,204 --> 01:15:06,333
Now give me that tablet and
tell me the combination.

1184
01:15:06,586 --> 01:15:09,253
Okay. After you give me Jed
and release my friends.

1185
01:15:09,337 --> 01:15:11,547
- You did all three!
- What?

1186
01:15:11,631 --> 01:15:13,550
You spoke and you reached
your hand across!

1187
01:15:13,634 --> 01:15:15,594
Look. I can talk to you
about this all night, okay?

1188
01:15:15,595 --> 01:15:16,994
- How about this?
- Look, just give...

1189
01:15:17,054 --> 01:15:19,346
How about I don't kill you right
now, like I really, really want to,

1190
01:15:19,431 --> 01:15:21,474
and I give you
precisely five seconds

1191
01:15:21,559 --> 01:15:24,269
to give me that tablet and
tell me the combination?

1192
01:15:24,353 --> 01:15:27,939
We already got the combination.
It's pi.

1193
01:15:28,356 --> 01:15:33,069
- 3.14159265.
- No!

1194
01:15:33,154 --> 01:15:34,779
- Hey.
- Sorry.

1195
01:15:35,530 --> 01:15:37,823
So Crazy Hair here,
he sang.

1196
01:15:37,908 --> 01:15:41,578
Oh, did he sing!
Like a canary.

1197
01:15:42,287 --> 01:15:43,747
I'm sorry, Larry.

1198
01:15:43,831 --> 01:15:45,873
Enough out of you! Remember
what happened last time?

1199
01:15:45,957 --> 01:15:48,251
- That's enough.
- Stupid man.

1200
01:15:51,087 --> 01:15:52,130
You okay?

1201
01:15:52,215 --> 01:15:53,756
Yeah, thanks.

1202
01:15:53,841 --> 01:15:56,301
Must be a real bummer
for you, Larry,

1203
01:15:57,261 --> 01:16:01,305
knowing that all of your valiant
efforts were, in the end, for naught.

1204
01:16:02,682 --> 01:16:06,394
What a terrible disappointment
you must be to yourself.

1205
01:16:16,072 --> 01:16:18,113
Do you hear that humming sound?

1206
01:16:19,699 --> 01:16:21,743
Do you know what
that sound is?

1207
01:16:23,828 --> 01:16:25,287
It's rhetorical.

1208
01:16:25,957 --> 01:16:29,583
That is the sound
of the End.

1209
01:16:37,426 --> 01:16:38,969
I'm sorry, Jed.

1210
01:16:39,511 --> 01:16:41,429
You did your
best, Gigantor.

1211
01:16:42,347 --> 01:16:44,640
Dadgum it, we almost
had him, too.

1212
01:16:44,725 --> 01:16:47,935
No, I mean, I'm sorry I wasn't around
the last couple of years at the museum.

1213
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:50,188
Maybe none of this
would have happened.

1214
01:16:50,273 --> 01:16:52,481
You don't get it,
do you, Gigantor?

1215
01:16:52,565 --> 01:16:54,984
I didn't call you 'cause
we needed your help.

1216
01:16:55,069 --> 01:16:56,735
Sure, we were in
a little pickle,

1217
01:16:56,820 --> 01:16:58,381
but it wouldn't have
been the first time

1218
01:16:58,405 --> 01:17:01,032
I had to wrestle my way
out of a root sack.

1219
01:17:01,449 --> 01:17:04,868
No, partner. I called you
'cause you needed us.

1220
01:17:05,704 --> 01:17:09,082
That fancy suit you've been parading
around in these past couple years,

1221
01:17:09,166 --> 01:17:11,251
that there's
a hanging suit.

1222
01:17:11,335 --> 01:17:14,212
All gussied up,
but dead inside.

1223
01:17:14,838 --> 01:17:16,171
That ain't you.

1224
01:17:17,048 --> 01:17:19,634
- And I'll tell you another thing.
- Yeah.

1225
01:17:19,719 --> 01:17:21,386
This night
ain't over yet.

1226
01:17:22,095 --> 01:17:25,265
This little Midnight Cowboy's
got some fight left in him.

1227
01:17:25,349 --> 01:17:28,518
Something tells me
you do, too. Ho, now!

1228
01:17:57,506 --> 01:18:02,260
Welcome to the new, extended
reign of Kahmunrah,

1229
01:18:02,345 --> 01:18:04,136
Fifth King of Egypt

1230
01:18:04,220 --> 01:18:06,972
and now the world!

1231
01:18:07,557 --> 01:18:10,935
Horus, Ra, my warriors,
come forth!

1232
01:18:11,436 --> 01:18:16,399
Send Larry Daley and his
friends to their doom!

1233
01:18:41,216 --> 01:18:42,841
Halt!

1234
01:18:43,844 --> 01:18:46,720
The mighty Octavius
has returned!

1235
01:18:46,805 --> 01:18:52,226
I ride on the back of nature's
most fearsome creature! I ride

1236
01:18:53,229 --> 01:18:56,523
the squirrel!

1237
01:18:59,150 --> 01:19:02,194
Forward now,
my mighty steed!

1238
01:19:05,490 --> 01:19:08,409
Whoa, girl! Easy.

1239
01:19:08,493 --> 01:19:10,662
Do you wish to
surrender honorably?

1240
01:19:10,746 --> 01:19:13,997
Or must this end with the
spilling of your blood?

1241
01:19:16,167 --> 01:19:18,837
This? This is
your big rescue?

1242
01:19:19,712 --> 01:19:22,673
Oh, no. This is!

1243
01:19:34,103 --> 01:19:36,729
What is that thing?

1244
01:19:36,814 --> 01:19:38,939
The name
is Abraham Lincoln.

1245
01:19:39,024 --> 01:19:41,317
And you, sir,
are in a heap of trouble!

1246
01:19:41,402 --> 01:19:42,484
Attack it!

1247
01:19:49,909 --> 01:19:51,703
Disgusting half-pigeons!

1248
01:20:02,338 --> 01:20:04,798
No, no, no! Hello?

1249
01:20:04,884 --> 01:20:07,217
Adiós, bird brains!

1250
01:20:07,302 --> 01:20:09,011
Wait, wait, wait.
No, no!

1251
01:20:09,095 --> 01:20:11,096
Goodbye, strange birdmen.

1252
01:20:11,222 --> 01:20:13,182
Do not return
to the Underworld!

1253
01:20:13,266 --> 01:20:15,268
Yes, yes, do go back
into the Underworld!

1254
01:20:15,351 --> 01:20:16,895
Thank you for coming!
Good night!

1255
01:20:16,979 --> 01:20:18,061
No, no!

1256
01:20:26,654 --> 01:20:29,740
Oh, this is awkward.

1257
01:20:30,074 --> 01:20:32,868
It appears
my work here is done.

1258
01:20:33,412 --> 01:20:38,917
Just remember, son, a house divided
against itself cannot stand.

1259
01:20:41,712 --> 01:20:42,753
Farewell.

1260
01:20:43,421 --> 01:20:45,840
What now?

1261
01:20:45,925 --> 01:20:47,466
You know,
I'm not quite sure.

1262
01:20:48,676 --> 01:20:52,262
I suppose we should probably
start by watching him die.

1263
01:20:53,474 --> 01:20:56,768
<i>Streltsy!</i>
Make him dead!

1264
01:20:59,813 --> 01:21:01,605
Now what?

1265
01:21:04,025 --> 01:21:07,153
We are not going
to attack right

1266
01:21:07,238 --> 01:21:10,364
now!

1267
01:21:19,166 --> 01:21:20,958
Get them!

1268
01:21:40,688 --> 01:21:43,355
Fear not, Larry!
I will help Jedediah!

1269
01:21:43,439 --> 01:21:45,108
You come at them
from behind!

1270
01:21:47,485 --> 01:21:49,404
- Hey, what's going on?
- I'm hiding.

1271
01:21:49,488 --> 01:21:51,738
Hiding? What are you doing?
Come on, we need you.

1272
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:54,074
I'm a failure.

1273
01:21:54,158 --> 01:21:55,868
Hey, no, you're not.

1274
01:21:55,994 --> 01:21:58,704
Did you foolishly lead 208
Americans to their deaths

1275
01:21:58,831 --> 01:22:00,497
at the Battle
of Little Bighorn?

1276
01:22:01,708 --> 01:22:06,128
- No.
- No. Not good. Not good at all.

1277
01:22:06,212 --> 01:22:07,255
That's not good.

1278
01:22:07,338 --> 01:22:08,631
Sure, I talk a good game,

1279
01:22:08,716 --> 01:22:10,007
but the truth
of the matter is,

1280
01:22:10,091 --> 01:22:11,509
I don't deserve
these stars.

1281
01:22:13,011 --> 01:22:16,346
I will always be famous
for my biggest failure.

1282
01:22:19,435 --> 01:22:20,518
Hey.

1283
01:22:20,894 --> 01:22:22,895
The past is
the past, okay?

1284
01:22:23,605 --> 01:22:26,356
Right now, this
moment, this night,

1285
01:22:27,818 --> 01:22:29,694
this is what you're
gonna be remembered for.

1286
01:22:31,447 --> 01:22:33,113
This is your
last stand.

1287
01:22:50,798 --> 01:22:51,966
They need a leader.

1288
01:22:52,051 --> 01:22:53,551
Yeah, they need a leader.

1289
01:22:55,220 --> 01:22:57,471
Yeah? You want to be
their leader, huh?

1290
01:22:58,556 --> 01:23:00,307
- Yeah, I do.
- Let's do this!

1291
01:23:00,934 --> 01:23:02,060
- All right?
- Yeah.

1292
01:23:02,144 --> 01:23:03,478
Let's go!

1293
01:23:05,814 --> 01:23:07,230
Not good!

1294
01:23:07,733 --> 01:23:08,733
<i>Larry!</i>

1295
01:23:09,443 --> 01:23:10,525
Hey, Able!

1296
01:23:10,610 --> 01:23:11,610
<i>I want to help!</i>

1297
01:23:11,737 --> 01:23:12,819
Oh, great.

1298
01:23:12,904 --> 01:23:14,613
<i>Who are you?</i>
<i>This is my museum!</i>

1299
01:23:14,989 --> 01:23:16,740
<i>Well, he's my human.</i>
<i>Back off!</i>

1300
01:23:16,949 --> 01:23:18,909
<i>You need all the help</i>
<i>you can get, Jungle-Dweller!</i>

1301
01:23:19,118 --> 01:23:20,118
<i>Get over yourself</i>
<i>space snob!</i>

1302
01:23:20,203 --> 01:23:21,203
Guys! Hey, guys!

1303
01:23:21,287 --> 01:23:23,207
This is not the time to
get into this, all right?

1304
01:23:25,417 --> 01:23:26,751
Dexter, you know better.

1305
01:23:28,753 --> 01:23:30,634
All right? That's what
happens when you do that!

1306
01:23:30,672 --> 01:23:32,006
You get that.

1307
01:23:39,264 --> 01:23:41,599
Stop! Just stop! Stop!

1308
01:23:42,141 --> 01:23:45,144
Now, listen. You're
both proud capuchin!

1309
01:23:46,020 --> 01:23:47,822
You need to concentrate
on slapping the enemy!

1310
01:23:51,694 --> 01:23:52,984
Keep it together,
all right?

1311
01:23:53,112 --> 01:23:54,987
Come on, let's go!
Let's do it!

1312
01:23:56,948 --> 01:23:58,365
Jedediah! They need us!

1313
01:23:58,449 --> 01:23:59,783
I ain't gonna make it!

1314
01:24:00,202 --> 01:24:02,662
Afraid this cowboy's been
to his last hoedown.

1315
01:24:03,162 --> 01:24:09,001
Octavius, remember me as
I was, wild, and free, and...

1316
01:24:10,295 --> 01:24:12,046
No need for final words.

1317
01:24:12,131 --> 01:24:14,047
- I'm not finished yet.
- Oh.

1318
01:24:14,132 --> 01:24:15,934
I want to get to the story
of our relationship,

1319
01:24:15,967 --> 01:24:18,301
the evolution
from enemy to friends.

1320
01:24:18,470 --> 01:24:19,511
No!

1321
01:24:19,595 --> 01:24:20,762
It'll make you cry!

1322
01:24:20,847 --> 01:24:24,141
No! Because you
are going to live!

1323
01:24:31,315 --> 01:24:32,442
Whoo!

1324
01:24:35,112 --> 01:24:36,570
Let's go to work.

1325
01:24:36,654 --> 01:24:37,822
Have a sword.

1326
01:24:38,698 --> 01:24:40,158
Sword!

1327
01:24:57,341 --> 01:24:59,010
Incoming!

1328
01:25:18,279 --> 01:25:19,529
That smarts.

1329
01:25:23,118 --> 01:25:25,828
You smack, you kick!
You smack, you kick!

1330
01:25:25,912 --> 01:25:29,247
You smack, you kick! Teamwork, fellas!
<i>Wunderbar!</i>

1331
01:25:33,212 --> 01:25:34,545
How you doing, fellas?

1332
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:36,046
Boom! Bam!

1333
01:26:05,743 --> 01:26:07,453
- Are you all right?
- Never better.

1334
01:26:07,578 --> 01:26:09,704
Listen, when I give you the signal,
I want you to open the gate.

1335
01:26:09,789 --> 01:26:11,373
I take it
you have a plan.

1336
01:26:11,457 --> 01:26:12,958
I'm gonna
divide the house.

1337
01:26:17,756 --> 01:26:20,216
The tablet! Now!

1338
01:26:20,300 --> 01:26:21,716
Okay, sure,
you can have it.

1339
01:26:21,801 --> 01:26:23,881
Just tell me who the boss is
and I'll give it to you.

1340
01:26:23,929 --> 01:26:26,430
Or should I give it to Kahmunrah?
He's your master, right?

1341
01:26:26,681 --> 01:26:28,640
Nyet! He is not
our master!

1342
01:26:28,725 --> 01:26:30,350
Really? 'Cause
he acts like he is.

1343
01:26:30,435 --> 01:26:32,435
But fine, just tell me who the
boss is and you can have it.

1344
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:34,939
Hey! That'd be me.

1345
01:26:36,274 --> 01:26:39,443
This man is a peasant! I am the
only one here of noble birth!

1346
01:26:39,528 --> 01:26:42,488
Really? 'Cause he's got more
medals and a bigger hat, but...

1347
01:26:42,613 --> 01:26:44,614
Thank you. You might
got a lot of medals,

1348
01:26:44,699 --> 01:26:47,326
but you put one of your little
child hands on that tablet again,

1349
01:26:47,452 --> 01:26:50,246
it'll be the last thing them tiny
little mitts of yours ever touch.

1350
01:26:50,329 --> 01:26:52,206
Why would you touch
little Nippy?

1351
01:26:54,292 --> 01:26:55,626
I can handle this, okay?

1352
01:26:55,711 --> 01:26:58,796
You can handle nothing!
You can barely speak, you fool!

1353
01:26:58,881 --> 01:27:01,047
You know what?
No problem.

1354
01:27:01,132 --> 01:27:02,800
I'll give it to you.
You see that?

1355
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:08,305
Oh, you're
a spunky little fella!

1356
01:27:12,476 --> 01:27:17,899
Very clever, Mr. Daley, getting
them to fight amongst themselves.

1357
01:27:17,983 --> 01:27:19,817
Yeah. I can't
really take credit.

1358
01:27:19,902 --> 01:27:21,777
It was
Abraham Lincoln's idea.

1359
01:27:21,862 --> 01:27:24,238
You know,
a house divided can't...

1360
01:27:25,073 --> 01:27:27,073
- Doesn't do well.
- Yes, well,

1361
01:27:27,158 --> 01:27:30,869
you should have saved yourself
when you had the chance,

1362
01:27:32,497 --> 01:27:34,748
because now I shall have
the tremendous pleasure

1363
01:27:35,167 --> 01:27:36,500
of killing you myself!

1364
01:28:27,260 --> 01:28:28,636
What are you?

1365
01:28:30,805 --> 01:28:32,222
I'm the night guard.

1366
01:28:32,890 --> 01:28:35,725
No!

1367
01:28:44,903 --> 01:28:46,820
Victory is ours!

1368
01:28:48,573 --> 01:28:49,739
Yeah!

1369
01:28:55,204 --> 01:28:57,414
Whoo! That's what
I'm talking about!

1370
01:28:57,498 --> 01:28:59,375
Yeah!

1371
01:29:04,256 --> 01:29:06,673
I'd say somebody
found his moxie.

1372
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:10,594
The Battle of
the Smithsonian.

1373
01:29:12,264 --> 01:29:15,640
Perhaps the greatest battle
the world will never know.

1374
01:29:18,020 --> 01:29:19,353
We'll know.

1375
01:29:22,774 --> 01:29:24,358
Yeah.

1376
01:29:26,153 --> 01:29:28,945
Oh, man, I got an hour till sunrise.
I got to get you guys back.

1377
01:29:29,030 --> 01:29:33,033
In case you forgot, Gigantor,
they don't want us there anymore.

1378
01:29:33,118 --> 01:29:34,493
Well, I do.

1379
01:29:38,164 --> 01:29:40,875
Hey, think you could
hook us up with a ride?

1380
01:29:42,168 --> 01:29:44,002
My pleasure, of course.

1381
01:29:44,796 --> 01:29:48,298
Hang on a second. One last
thing I got to take care of.

1382
01:29:49,301 --> 01:29:51,719
Come on, boy!
Come on, come on!

1383
01:29:52,970 --> 01:29:54,137
Get in there!

1384
01:29:57,016 --> 01:29:58,475
Feels good, right?

1385
01:30:01,563 --> 01:30:05,483
You're welcome! Just get back
inside by sunrise, okay?

1386
01:30:19,206 --> 01:30:22,123
These are promising days,
indeed.

1387
01:30:45,273 --> 01:30:46,940
All right.
Hey, come on, guys.

1388
01:30:47,024 --> 01:30:48,943
Remember, stay with
your buddy, all right?

1389
01:30:50,194 --> 01:30:51,569
Good, good.

1390
01:31:02,541 --> 01:31:04,291
Well, you're back
where you belong.

1391
01:31:06,418 --> 01:31:08,212
Yeah. Think so.

1392
01:31:15,052 --> 01:31:16,511
I guess
I should be going.

1393
01:31:16,595 --> 01:31:17,680
Mmm.

1394
01:31:18,931 --> 01:31:20,474
Hey, Amelia.

1395
01:31:22,978 --> 01:31:25,729
That thing that I was trying
to tell you about earlier...

1396
01:31:28,567 --> 01:31:31,068
There's not really
an easy way to put this,

1397
01:31:32,112 --> 01:31:33,988
but, in the morning...

1398
01:31:34,072 --> 01:31:36,157
I know what's coming,
Mr. Daley.

1399
01:31:36,240 --> 01:31:37,615
I've always known.

1400
01:31:39,411 --> 01:31:41,078
But it doesn't matter.

1401
01:31:41,162 --> 01:31:45,123
You've given me the adventure
of a lifetime in one night.

1402
01:31:47,252 --> 01:31:50,671
And I have a feeling it's going
to be a beautiful sunrise.

1403
01:31:59,014 --> 01:32:00,514
Have fun.

1404
01:32:09,774 --> 01:32:11,108
Thanks.

1405
01:32:24,581 --> 01:32:25,747
Hmm!

1406
01:33:02,327 --> 01:33:06,162
I don't know about you fellas, but this
old cowboy just got to second base.

1407
01:33:09,042 --> 01:33:10,251
There she goes.

1408
01:33:10,335 --> 01:33:11,534
Straight towards...

1409
01:33:13,003 --> 01:33:14,712
Canada.

1410
01:33:15,715 --> 01:33:17,548
She's heading to Canada.

1411
01:33:19,886 --> 01:33:21,845
No, now she
course-corrected.

1412
01:33:26,475 --> 01:33:27,768
Here, head on
downstairs, guys.

1413
01:33:27,851 --> 01:33:29,310
- All righty.
- Good night, Larry.

1414
01:33:29,395 --> 01:33:30,854
Hey, boy,
how's it going?

1415
01:33:32,481 --> 01:33:35,234
Lawrence! Bless you
for bringing them back.

1416
01:33:35,359 --> 01:33:38,028
And might I say, a hearty
well-done is in order.

1417
01:33:38,154 --> 01:33:41,573
And may I also point out, they
cannot hide in the basement forever.

1418
01:33:41,658 --> 01:33:43,283
Yeah. No, I think
I got that figured out.

1419
01:33:43,368 --> 01:33:44,451
- Really?
- Yeah.

1420
01:33:44,536 --> 01:33:46,369
Sun come, dum-dum.

1421
01:33:47,372 --> 01:33:49,573
Our moai friend is right.
The dawn will soon be upon us.

1422
01:33:49,666 --> 01:33:51,082
- Hey, Teddy.
- Hmm?

1423
01:33:51,167 --> 01:33:52,626
Remember the other night
you were saying something

1424
01:33:52,711 --> 01:33:54,043
about the key to happiness?

1425
01:33:54,087 --> 01:33:54,439
Did I?

1426
01:33:54,463 --> 01:33:55,846
You said,
"The key to happiness is..."

1427
01:33:55,880 --> 01:33:58,298
And then the sun came up
and you froze.

1428
01:33:58,425 --> 01:34:00,216
- I think I got it figured out.
- Yes?

1429
01:34:00,719 --> 01:34:04,012
It's doing what you love, isn't it?
With people you love.

1430
01:34:06,265 --> 01:34:08,185
Actually, I was going to
say "physical exercise",

1431
01:34:08,225 --> 01:34:09,600
but the love thing's
good, too.

1432
01:34:15,358 --> 01:34:16,358
Lawrence!

1433
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:17,568
Yeah.

1434
01:34:19,904 --> 01:34:21,572
Welcome home, son.

1435
01:34:23,908 --> 01:34:25,367
Thanks.

1436
01:34:40,257 --> 01:34:42,009
Well, folks,
the wait is over.

1437
01:34:42,092 --> 01:34:43,886
After two months
of renovation,

1438
01:34:43,970 --> 01:34:47,680
tonight, The Museum of Natural History
reopens its doors to the public.

1439
01:34:47,765 --> 01:34:50,141
As you can see, New
Yorkers are flooding in,

1440
01:34:50,268 --> 01:34:52,770
eager to see just what
changes are in store.

1441
01:34:52,895 --> 01:34:54,604
With its new,
extended night hours,

1442
01:34:54,730 --> 01:34:57,440
we're told the museum will
be more lively than ever.

1443
01:35:06,451 --> 01:35:10,662
- Well, well, well, well!
- Hey.

1444
01:35:11,497 --> 01:35:14,123
I see the uniform still fits
after these long, long years.

1445
01:35:14,250 --> 01:35:16,627
Yeah, yeah. Really hasn't
been that long, but...

1446
01:35:17,503 --> 01:35:21,465
So, to what do we owe
this "triumphant" return?

1447
01:35:21,591 --> 01:35:25,010
Not cut out for the "corporate"
jungle after all. Got fired.

1448
01:35:26,805 --> 01:35:29,765
No, actually,
I sold my company.

1449
01:35:29,849 --> 01:35:32,810
The world doth move
in mysterious ways.

1450
01:35:32,935 --> 01:35:35,729
One day, we've got to get
rid of everything old,

1451
01:35:35,814 --> 01:35:41,859
the next, a rich, anonymous
donor gives a huge endowment.

1452
01:35:41,985 --> 01:35:45,948
With a proviso, everything
stays the same. So...

1453
01:35:50,619 --> 01:35:52,454
Well, not exactly the
same, obviously.

1454
01:35:52,479 --> 01:35:52,938
No.

1455
01:35:53,038 --> 01:35:55,957
Bully, lads and ladies, the
name is Theodore Roosevelt,

1456
01:35:56,042 --> 01:36:00,878
naturalist, Rough Rider and twenty-sixth
President of these great United States.

1457
01:36:01,005 --> 01:36:04,507
Come along, lad. The hunt is afoot.
Lawrence.

1458
01:36:10,014 --> 01:36:12,890
Hey, you dum-dums
bring me gum-gum?

1459
01:36:20,733 --> 01:36:24,069
My parents gave me this
tablet some 3,000 years ago,

1460
01:36:24,194 --> 01:36:28,323
entrusting me with one of my
people's most prized possessions.

1461
01:36:28,408 --> 01:36:29,949
Does it do anything?

1462
01:36:30,033 --> 01:36:31,243
Do anything?

1463
01:36:31,368 --> 01:36:33,369
Yeah. What's the point
if it doesn't do anything?

1464
01:36:34,538 --> 01:36:35,622
<i>Tell 'em.</i>

1465
01:36:35,707 --> 01:36:40,210
Actually, it has a magical power that
brings all the exhibits to life.

1466
01:36:40,336 --> 01:36:41,752
No, really,
what's it do?

1467
01:36:43,422 --> 01:36:45,923
Nothing. It's just
for decoration.

1468
01:36:46,050 --> 01:36:47,384
- I knew it.
- Mmm-hmm.

1469
01:36:48,552 --> 01:36:52,389
This place is lame. This thing
doesn't even look real.

1470
01:36:52,515 --> 01:36:55,600
Seriously, dude,
these animatronics suck.

1471
01:37:05,069 --> 01:37:06,487
- Mammoth?
- Yeah.

1472
01:37:06,570 --> 01:37:08,029
Extinct!

1473
01:37:08,405 --> 01:37:09,655
Today's technology
is beyond me.

1474
01:37:09,740 --> 01:37:10,782
I know.
It's so lifelike.

1475
01:37:10,867 --> 01:37:12,783
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Something else.

1476
01:37:13,203 --> 01:37:14,994
You'll stick around
a bit longer this time,

1477
01:37:15,078 --> 01:37:17,747
or you gonna run away again
when you get something better?

1478
01:37:18,875 --> 01:37:20,354
- I'm gonna stay.
- Stay, for a long time.

1479
01:37:20,417 --> 01:37:21,585
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1480
01:37:22,252 --> 01:37:27,381
Good. 'Cause, as night
guards go, you're...

1481
01:37:28,592 --> 01:37:30,886
- What?
- The best.

1482
01:37:32,095 --> 01:37:33,721
Excuse me.

1483
01:37:39,061 --> 01:37:41,270
You, the toddler!
Don't hug the displays.

1484
01:38:17,975 --> 01:38:19,059
I'm sorry. Hi.

1485
01:38:19,143 --> 01:38:21,144
I don't mean to stare.
I just...

1486
01:38:21,479 --> 01:38:24,648
You look a lot like
somebody I know, and...

1487
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:26,817
I get that a lot.

1488
01:38:26,943 --> 01:38:27,652
Do you?

1489
01:38:27,676 --> 01:38:30,511
Yeah. I guess I have
that kind of face.

1490
01:38:31,154 --> 01:38:32,863
- Familiar.
- Yeah.

1491
01:38:33,949 --> 01:38:36,952
You're not by any chance related
to Amelia Earhart, are you?

1492
01:38:37,703 --> 01:38:39,078
- No.
- No.

1493
01:38:39,162 --> 01:38:41,163
- No, I don't think so.
- Of course you're not.

1494
01:38:41,291 --> 01:38:43,041
I mean, I don't know.
Maybe I'm...

1495
01:38:43,126 --> 01:38:45,210
I just had to ask.
I'm sorry.

1496
01:38:45,837 --> 01:38:49,297
She was that woman who
flew across the Pacific.

1497
01:38:49,381 --> 01:38:51,216
- The Atlantic.
- Atlantic. Of course.

1498
01:38:51,341 --> 01:38:53,801
First woman to fly across the Atlantic,
and she received the Flying Cross,

1499
01:38:53,886 --> 01:38:55,511
