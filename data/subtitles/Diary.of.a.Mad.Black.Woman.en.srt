00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,000
March 11.

2
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,800
Dear diary,
my husband of 18 years...

3
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,000
this week is being honored
by the city of Atlanta...

4
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,700
as the Jacob Frienstein
Attorney of the Year.

5
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,600
I am so proud of him.

6
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,200
He has worked so hard.

7
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,300
I wanna swing

8
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:56,700
Swing till daylight
with you

9
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,800
I wanna dance

10
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,600
Dance the whole night through

11
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,900
Where the beat-beat-beat
is jumping

12
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,200
And the crowd is feeling fine

13
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,600
Where the dance-dance-dances
are popping

14
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,800
Theirs are flowing like wine

15
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:18,200
I wanna swing

16
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,000
Swing till daylight with you

17
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,700
I wanna dance...

18
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,400
To look at us...

19
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,300
you would think
that we've got it all together.

20
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,800
But looks can be deceiving.

21
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:35,800
Some days are good
and I think he loves me.

22
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,800
Then other days...

23
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,300
I think he doesn't care.

24
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,000
Dancing till daylight

25
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:45,000
Just us two

26
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,700
Kicking up my heels...

27
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,000
I never thought
I'd see this day.

28
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,500
I was just saying
to my wife this morning...

29
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,000
that if I died and came back...

30
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,400
that I would want
to come back as me.

31
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,400
No, truly it is an honor...

32
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,600
to receive the Jacob Frienstein
Attorney of the Year Award.

33
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,800
It's especially
an honor because...

34
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,500
He is so into appearances.

35
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,600
What looks one way
on the outside...

36
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,800
can be a totally different
matter on the inside.

37
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:19,300
There is no way...
no way...

38
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,600
that I could have done
any of this...

39
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:26,100
without my wonderful wife
of 18 years.

40
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:41,500
I don't know this stranger
I sit next to.

41
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:45,300
All I know is that with
every dime and every case...

42
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,900
he has changed.

43
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:06,300
How about l...
run us a hot bath?

44
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,800
I left something at the office.

45
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,200
I have to go.

46
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,500
Who is she?

47
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,700
When you get a job
and pay one of these bills...

48
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,300
then you can ask me questions.

49
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,100
I am still your wife.

50
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,100
That's cute.

51
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:30,500
Charles...
I don't want to fight.

52
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,100
This is your night.
Let's just enjoy it.

53
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:38,500
Tell me what I need to do,
and I will do it.

54
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,300
You really want to know
what you ought to do?

55
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,100
Get the hell out of my car.

56
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,200
What a way
to start our anniversary.

57
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:49,300
Tell me...why do I love
that man so much?

58
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,300
Maybe if I could stop
thinking about...

59
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,300
how good things used to be...

60
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,400
I might be able to find
the strength to leave.

61
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,300
Hi, Sarah. How are you?

62
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,600
Hi, Mrs. McCarter.

63
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,000
Hey, Mrs. McCarter.

64
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,900
Kalvin, how are you?
How is Joanne?

65
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,900
-She's doing great.
-That's great.

66
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,300
-You doing all right?
-I'm wonderful. Thank you.

67
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,200
Listen, is he in?
Because I brought him, uh...

68
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,300
lunch.

69
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,200
Actually, I'm headed that way--

70
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:36,000
No, no. Please.
Thank you, though. Thank you.

71
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,600
Helen.

72
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,800
What, um...

73
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:48,100
Um...hi.
I'm Brenda Marcos.

74
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,900
How do you do?

75
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,500
Um...we got to go.

76
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,200
You ready, little fella?

77
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,500
It was nice to meet you.

78
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,100
Is that her?

79
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,900
Don't play games with me.
Tell me, Charles.

80
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,500
Is that her?

81
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Thank you.

82
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,300
I'll see you at home.

83
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,300
Excuse me.
Excuse me!

84
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,500
What?

85
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,300
-What are you doing?
-Working.

86
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,600
Where are you going
with my things?

87
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:52,800
Lady, look...I'm just filling in
for my cousin because he's sick.

88
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,300
Somebody named Charles McCarter
or something like that...

89
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,500
rented this truck,
told me to load it up and wait.

90
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,800
So that's what I'm doing.

91
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,800
No. Wait. Wait.

92
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,300
Christina?

93
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,900
Christina.
Christina, there--

94
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,400
there is a man out there
putting my things in a truck.

95
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,900
What is going on?

96
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,900
Mr. McCarter asked me to pack
all your things this morning.

97
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,300
And all these clothes
are from the boutique.

98
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:27,700
I wish I had a man to do
something like this for me.

99
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,900
Happy anniversary.

100
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,100
-I have something to tell you.
-Your gift first.

101
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:13,400
Aren't you going to open it?
Charles, I have to admit...

102
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,500
I thought you forgot,
but I saw all the clothes...

103
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,100
in the closet
and...ta-da! Ha ha!

104
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,100
It's not exactly my taste,
but I love it.

105
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,400
Helen--

106
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,300
This one, it doesn't really
fit quite right, though.

107
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,100
I think I'm going to have
to get some alterations--

108
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,200
Helen.

109
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,100
You see how I keep
interrupting you?

110
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,300
Charles, I only want
to hear the good tonight.

111
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,000
OK?

112
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:45,600
I need to tell you something.

113
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,400
What is she doing here?

114
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,300
I asked her to come.

115
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,200
Charles, what is going on?

116
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,700
Is she wearing the dress
that I just picked out?

117
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,500
What?!

118
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,500
There's no easy way
to say this...

119
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,600
but our marriage
has run its course.

120
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,400
It's over.

121
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,500
What? What are you
trying to say?

122
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,500
I'm saying...
it's over.

123
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,700
Charles!

124
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,000
Helen,
don't act so surprised.

125
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,300
I mean, I haven't
touched you in a year.

126
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,800
I haven't...well...

127
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,900
I haven't been happy for years.

128
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
18 years, and you think
you can just come in here...

129
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,300
and end it like this?

130
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:24,600
Charles, what am I supposed
to do without you?

131
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,500
You're a bright girl.
You'll figure it out.

132
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:33,800
Charles...please.

133
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,800
-Oh, my God.
-Don't do this.

134
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,300
Please tell me you're not one of
those weak begging sisters.

135
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,600
Brenda, let me handle this.

136
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,600
You are not leaving.

137
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:53,000
No...I'm not leaving.

138
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,500
But you are.

139
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,500
There's a truck outside.

140
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,200
It's full of gas,
and I hired some guy...

141
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,000
to take you
anywhere you want to go.

142
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,100
I can't keep treating her
like this. And my children...

143
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,800
not seeing their daddy
every night.

144
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,100
I'm staying here and there--

145
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,500
Children?

146
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,000
Two boys. They need me.

147
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,500
Charles.

148
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,700
It's me.
How can you say this to me?

149
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,600
How can you do this to me?

150
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:28,800
Good-bye, Helen. Now,
be a lady and leave quietly.

151
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,700
-No.
-No?

152
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,800
You would've never had
any of this without me.

153
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,500
Now, you better
get up out of here...

154
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:38,000
-before I lose my temper.
-No!

155
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,400
No, I am not leaving!

156
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:43,000
-You what?
-No!

157
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,000
You're leaving, all right.

158
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,900
You're leaving. Go on.

159
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,700
Any way you want to do it.

160
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,900
Get up! Get up!

161
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:57,200
Aah! No! Charles! No!

162
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,500
Come on.

163
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,600
Huh? Come on.

164
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,800
What you doin'?

165
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,400
Get out of here! Get out!

166
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,100
Charles! Charles!

167
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,200
Charles!

168
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,900
Oh, what the hell
have they got me into?

169
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,600
Hey, look...

170
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,900
we've been driving
around for hours now.

171
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,900
I do have another job that
I have to be at in a few hours.

172
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,800
So there's got to be
someplace I can take you.

173
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,600
Take me where?

174
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,500
He has alienated me
from my entire family.

175
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:28,300
He made me put my mother
in a home bec--

176
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,900
Because she didn't fit
into his "American dream."

177
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,500
I don't have anyplace to go.

178
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,300
Lady, I'm really sorry
to hear about that...

179
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,700
but it's the middle
of the night--

180
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:45,800
-Just stop the truck!
-I'm trying to help you out.

181
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,100
-Just stop the truck!
-I'm not stopping the truck.

182
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,500
All you men are just alike!
You just think about yourselves!

183
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,300
You don't think about
anybody else but yourself!

184
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,200
Just stop the truck,
and I will drive myself...

185
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,800
where I have to!
Pull the truck over!

186
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,900
Hey! Don't grab the wheel!
Hey. Don't touch the wheel.

187
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,400
I'm stopping. I'm stopping.

188
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,800
-Then get out!
-We're in the middle of nowhere.

189
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,400
I don't care!
Get out of the car!

190
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,900
I'll drive myself!

191
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,600
You know what? Now I see
why you're going through...

192
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,300
what you're going through.

193
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,800
Oh, you go to hell!

194
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,600
Have a nice life.

195
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,300
Yeah, you're welcome!

196
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,100
Don't shoot! It's Helen...

197
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,500
your granddaughter!
Don't shoot!

198
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,800
What the hell? Girl!

199
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,200
I always open the door
this time of night shooting...

200
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,800
'cause there ain't nothing
but a crackhead...

201
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,700
or the police knocking
on your door this time of night.

202
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,000
What you doing here this late?

203
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,900
I was in the neighborhood and--

204
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,800
You were in the neighborhood?

205
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,100
I thought I'd come by
and say hi.

206
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,000
You live in a mansion
on the other side of town.

207
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,000
What the hell you doing
in the ghetto?

208
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,800
You ain't on that stuff, is you?

209
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,500
Is you over here trying
to buy some stuff?

210
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,800
I missed you.

211
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,000
Come by in the daylight here.
Don't come by--

212
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,400
Madea, please.

213
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,200
Come on in here.

214
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,500
Who that is at the door?

215
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,800
Shut up, Joe. I got this.

216
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,800
...I'm gonna have
to put my foot down.

217
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,600
Kunta Kinte put his foot down,
and it got chopped off.

218
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:11,200
Now shut the hell up
and go back to sleep.

219
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:33,100
I know I had some
cigarettes in this--

220
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,300
Harpo.

221
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:38,600
Harpo, who this woman?

222
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,500
Joe, go in that room
and take your medicine.

223
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,400
You know you crazy as hell
when you don't take it.

224
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:46,100
I say hell...no.

225
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,400
What the hell?

226
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,500
Look what you
done made me do!

227
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,900
Oh, hell!

228
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,800
Get the hell up.

229
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:00,000
You didn't come by yesterday.

230
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,000
You got to eat something
out there on them streets.

231
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,500
You got to be careful,
you hear?

232
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:08,200
Look at you. Lord help me.

233
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,900
You ain't got
no regular clothes, do you?

234
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:11,900
What?

235
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,000
Helen...hey.

236
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,100
Debrah?

237
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,300
Yeah, girl.

238
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,300
You gonna hug me?

239
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,800
Yeah.

240
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,600
So, how are you doing?

241
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,200
You look good. You look good.

242
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,700
Marrying that rich lawyer.

243
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:43,000
When we were kids, we both said
we'd get a rich man, right?

244
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,400
We both got lawyers.

245
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,900
Deb, what--
what's going on?

246
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Don't. Don't do that.
Don't judge me.

247
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,700
Thank you. I got to go.

248
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:00,000
You take care of yourself
out there.

249
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,900
Lord.

250
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,600
You hungry?

251
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,400
I can't eat anything.

252
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,800
You need to eat something.

253
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,000
What happened to her?

254
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,100
Life.

255
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,400
Brian and the kids must
really be going through it.

256
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,900
They're doing all right.

257
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,700
But I want to talk about you.

258
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,400
I called Charles this morning...

259
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,000
and he told me,
before he hung up...

260
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,500
that you and him
is getting a divorce.

261
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,100
But what I can't seem
to figure out is why you here.

262
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,000
He put me out of the house.

263
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,100
-Who house?
-Our house.

264
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:38,500
Exactly. How the hell
a man gonna put a woman...

265
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,400
out of her own house?
He might've put me out...

266
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,800
but he was gonna
put me out of half.

267
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,300
I'm gonna go in
the other half of the house.

268
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,800
He wasn't puttin' me
out of all of it.

269
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,500
The house is in his name, Madea.

270
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,100
Lord have mercy.
That's how women get messed up.

271
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,300
Too busy out shopping when you
need to be checking the deed.

272
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,800
Whoo! That makes me mad, girl.

273
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,200
I don't have any rights
to the money.

274
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,600
No right?

275
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,400
I signed a prenup.

276
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,300
What the hell
you sign a prenup--

277
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,400
I ought to punch you
in the face.

278
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,100
Who the hell told you
to sign a renup?

279
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,500
He didn't have nothin'
when you married him!

280
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,300
Charles always knew
he'd be successful.

281
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,600
And he said to me...

282
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,800
"l want to know that
you're here for love."

283
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,900
And I didn't have a job.

284
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,400
So it's his money.

285
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,700
Is it? What was you doing
while he was working, honey?

286
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,800
Taking care of the house,
cooking and cleaning.

287
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:29,300
Exactly.
That sounds like a job to me.

288
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,000
Cooking and cleaning--
how long you do that?

289
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,700
18 years.

290
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,800
All right. OK.

291
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:38,300
18 years...

292
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,300
let's see how much he owes you.

293
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,600
18 years...

294
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,000
you've been cooking...

295
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,800
cleaning...

296
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
having sex with him
when he wanted.

297
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,800
-Was it good?
-No.

298
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,600
Major deduction.

299
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,100
And I didn't tell you
that he hit me.

300
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,700
Girl, that man
owes you 64 billion...

301
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,000
283 million, 974 trillion...

302
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,700
5 thousand...

303
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:28,100
and 20 dollars and 82 cents.

304
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,800
Now, you need to get your money.

305
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,900
-That'll never happen.
-You want to bet?

306
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,700
I can happen
one of two ways, honey.

307
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,800
You can get it from his
checking account voluntarily...

308
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,400
or his insurance policy.

309
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,100
Involuntary manslaughter.
Which one it's gonna be?

310
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,400
-Madea.
-Mm-mm.

311
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,400
I ain't gonna have this.
Come on.

312
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,400
-What? Where are we going?
-To your house.

313
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,400
Oh, no. The guard
will never let us in.

314
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,300
I said come on!

315
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,100
Mayday! Mayday!

316
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,200
Lord have mercy.

317
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,300
Get your stuff.

318
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,000
What the hell
is wrong with you?

319
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,500
These your clothes?

320
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,800
They're hers.

321
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,700
Oh, they're hers?

322
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:24,600
Who is, uh...
"Dol...say & Gab-anna?"

323
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,700
Who that is?

324
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:29,300
Dolce and Gabbana.
They're designers.

325
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,200
Oh. She a label ho.

326
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,300
$700 for a damn rag?

327
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,300
Just a rag.

328
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,800
Madea, no, no, no.
Don't do that.

329
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,200
This man left you...

330
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,900
for some old floozy.

331
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,400
Madea, what's wrong?

332
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:03,400
A wire hanger!

333
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,500
Rip it.

334
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,800
Rip it?

335
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,100
-Rip it.
-No, no.

336
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,800
Rip it!

337
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,700
-Rip it? Rip it!
-Rip it!

338
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,800
Rip it!

339
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,100
Rip it!

340
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:23,200
What the hell are you doing?

341
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:27,900
Rip it like this!
Get mad at it!

342
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,200
It'll make you feel better!
Rip it!

343
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,900
Rip it! Rip it!

344
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Rip something!

345
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,100
-Rip it!
-Rip it!

346
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,700
Rip it real good. Rip it.

347
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,300
Wait a minute.
What's this gonna solve?

348
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,900
Nothing. It's just gonna
make you feel better.

349
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,200
-Rip it! Ha ha ha!
-Rip it!

350
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
This is for every black woman...

351
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:03,200
who ever had a problem
with a black man!

352
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,400
Goodness.

353
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,400
Calm down, girl.

354
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,600
I'm tired as hell.

355
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,100
OK.

356
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,200
I'm gonna go down
to the office.

357
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,200
I forgot some things.

358
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:33,500
OK...you go down
in the office...

359
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,600
because you forgot something.

360
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:38,800
Find me some oxygen.

361
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:41,700
And bring me some oxygen!

362
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,300
What are you doing in here?

363
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,900
Charles.

364
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,800
Are you stealing from me?

365
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,800
No. No, I just--

366
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:32,300
How did you get in here?
I changed the locks.

367
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:40,200
What the--who are you?

368
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,800
Who are you?

369
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,500
I'm the owner of this house.

370
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,200
Wrong answer.
My granddaughter Helen...

371
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,200
is the owner of this house.

372
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,800
You're the ho. You ain't
got no power or no deed.

373
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:52,100
Did you do this?
This is Vera Wang!

374
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,300
Who that is? She do nails?
I need to get my nails did.

375
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,500
That's it!
I'm calling the police!

376
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:00,300
I'm not scared of no popo.
Call the popo, ho.

377
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,600
Call the popo, ho!

378
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:05,200
Charles, please...

379
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:07,900
I don't have any money, and--

380
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I tried to be nice to you,
didn't l?

381
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:15,200
Didn't l?

382
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,900
I'll just go.

383
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,500
You'll just go?

384
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,600
I'll just take it,
and I'll just go.

385
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,600
Oh, you'll just
take it and go, huh?

386
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:28,300
You're gonna take
my money and go?!

387
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,600
If I call the police, they're
gonna be here in ten minutes.

388
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:34,300
OK. Then that leaves me nine
to beat the hell out of you.

389
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,800
You think?
I know tae kwon do.

390
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:39,800
And I know whoop your ass.
Come on. Bring it on.

391
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,900
You don't know me.
I'm from the projects.

392
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,900
Come on.
What the hell is your problem?

393
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,500
Come on. Shut up. Shut up!

394
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,800
Oh, hell no. Watch out.

395
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,200
Yeah, you keep running!

396
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,900
What?
Now you asking me questions?!

397
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,300
You begging now?

398
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,300
Oh, please do it.
Please hit her.

399
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,500
Please!
I want to see you do it.

400
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,900
What the hell's wrong with you?

401
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,700
Here, now, you bastard.
Put your hands on her.

402
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,500
Oh, my God! Don't hurt him!

403
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,100
Oh, I'm not gonna hurt him.
I'm gonna kill him.

404
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,500
Putting his hand
on my granddaughter.

405
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,200
I'm calling the police.

406
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,200
You call the police, so they can
see how you done hit her.

407
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,300
No, just get out.

408
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:14,800
Charles, I have been nothing but
a good woman and wife to you.

409
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,800
I don't deserve this.

410
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:20,600
You will reap what you sow.

411
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,600
Keep your money.

412
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,400
You crazy as hell.

413
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,500
Just leave it.

414
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:29,300
I might leave some of it.

415
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,900
It was this that made you
the evil bastard that you are.

416
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,100
Get out.

417
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,500
Here, now, the way I see it...

418
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,100
half of everything in this house
belongs to her...

419
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,600
and I ain't leaving here
till she get it.

420
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,000
-She'll never see it.
-What did he say?

421
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,600
Come on, Madea. Let's go.

422
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,900
That's right. Go.

423
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,800
Give me 5 minutes with her
in the bathroom, please.

424
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,500
Madea, let's go.

425
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,900
OK. Oh, yeah. I'm leaving.

426
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,000
It's just a matter of time...

427
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,700
before he does
the same thing to you.

428
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:03,400
Never. I could never be you.

429
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:06,400
I'm a woman who knows
how to get and keep her man!

430
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:10,100
What's that?

431
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,400
Madea...

432
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,100
Half of everything
in here belongs to her.

433
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,000
Which half do you want?
Do you want this half...

434
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,800
or do you want this half?

435
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,800
Madea.

436
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,400
Your Honor,
case number 456790--

437
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:09,200
the People versus Mabel Simmons
and Helen McCarter.

438
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,600
Criminal trespassing,
reckless endangerment...

439
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,100
criminal possession
of a handgun...

440
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,500
assault with a deadly weapon...

441
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,500
What are you
walking so fast for?

442
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,500
Suspended license,
expired registration...

443
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,500
reckless driving,
and a broken taillight.

444
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,300
Girl, I know that ain't
who I think it is.

445
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:29,800
I know you didn't say
Mabel Simmons. Madea?

446
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,900
How are you doing,
Judge Mablean?

447
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:35,000
It's good to see you.
Your hair is pretty, girl.

448
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,700
Look at you.
You're looking good.

449
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,400
How you been?

450
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,700
You're still at it?

451
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,200
This ain't even my fault.
What had happened was--

452
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:44,000
Save it.
Who's here for the defense?

453
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,700
Brian Simmons here on behalf...

454
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,600
of Mrs. McCarter and
Mrs. Simmons, your Honor.

455
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,900
-Brian?
-How you doing, Judge Ephriam?

456
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:52,500
I'm getting tired
of seeing your aunt.

457
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,800
I'm tired of seeing you.

458
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,100
It won't happen again.

459
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,600
Yeah, I bet.

460
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:02,200
Bail is set at $5,000
for Miss McCarter...

461
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:05,400
property or cash.
But as for you, Madea...

462
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:08,000
I'm placing you
under house arrest.

463
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,800
You ain't putting me
on no house arrest, honey.

464
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,100
I ain't fi'n
to to deal with that.

465
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,700
It's either that or prison.
What's your choice?

466
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,400
I'll take the house arrest.

467
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,900
Bailiff, call the next case.

468
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:21,800
The city of Atlanta
versus Bobby Brown.

469
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,400
What is this,
repeat-offender day?

470
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:27,100
Bobby! Bobby, I love you!
Sit down, Miss Houston.

471
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,800
-OK, you like hot sauce?
-Put that lid down!

472
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:50,000
What the hell?
How the hell you do that?

473
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,800
You don't know
what we're playing?

474
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,500
Hey, Daddy.

475
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,200
I see you got Thelma and Louise
out of jail.

476
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,900
Yeah, I did. Hey, stop running.

477
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,300
Stop running.
Say hi to your aunt Helen.

478
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,800
-Hi.
-Hi.

479
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:08,000
That's your son. Tiffany.

480
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:11,400
-My God. How old is she now?
-She'll be twelve tomorrow.

481
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,900
Hey, baby. How you doing?

482
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,700
-Can l?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

483
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,300
So...

484
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,900
I saw Debrah.

485
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,600
I didn't know she was so bad.

486
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:31,200
Yeah. She took it pretty hard
when you left.

487
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,100
Charles wanted us
to move away from anything...

488
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:38,300
that reminded him of the past,
and why I let him do that...

489
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,900
Debrah and I were thick
as thieves growing up, huh?

490
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,700
Yeah, you were.

491
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,000
I'll tell you what.
Y'all about to be set.

492
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,700
What you got? Oh, hell.

493
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,700
Y'all don't know nothing
about playing no cards.

494
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,200
I'm gonna take mine and git.

495
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,900
I could have spent my money
in a better place.

496
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,200
Did you hear me, John?

497
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:57,600
We gonna play, or we gonna talk?

498
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:03,000
Joe, let me get some.

499
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,100
That's some good stuff.

500
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,500
You want some, John?

501
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,000
I guess not.

502
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:14,800
Joe, let me get some.

503
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:17,000
Last time we gave you
some of this stuff, Mildred...

504
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,700
we had to call the popo on you.

505
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:19,900
We had to call the ambulance
and everything.

506
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,300
You went crazy as hell.

507
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,400
You ain't supposed to smoke this
when you're on lithium.

508
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,000
I'm all right.

509
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:28,400
All right. Don't wet up my butt,
get the lipstick all over it.

510
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,800
You act crazy if you want to.
Whose play is it?

511
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,000
Play something.
Play something.

512
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:35,700
Brian, can you handle
my divorce?

513
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,400
You don't even have to ask.

514
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:42,800
I always thought that
if I did all I could...

515
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,900
God would bless my marriage.

516
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,700
It takes a lot more
than you doing all you can.

517
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,200
And who's to say that
this is not your blessing?

518
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,900
You know, sometimes
we hold onto the things...

519
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,600
that God himself
is trying to tear away.

520
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:54,900
It's not that easy.

521
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,700
You know women. We love hard.

522
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,200
-And men don't?
-Not like a woman.

523
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,900
I don't know
if I agree with that.

524
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,300
We don't love as easy...

525
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,000
but when we love,
we love just as hard.

526
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,700
You don't see men
getting themselves...

527
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,100
in situations like mine.

528
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,000
The mother of my kids
is a junkie...

529
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,600
and I love her.

530
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,800
That's a tough situation.

531
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:19,100
Yeah. I look at Tiff--

532
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,600
she is so much like her.
She wants to sing.

533
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,200
I can't let her do that.

534
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,800
She's not Debrah.

535
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:30,300
Tell that to my heart.

536
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,400
Orlando. O-dawg,
what's going on, man?

537
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:37,100
Big Brian, what's up, man?

538
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,800
Y'all got it smelling
real right around here.

539
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,300
That's my deal, man.
That's my deal.

540
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,100
Hey, I want to introduce
you to somebody.

541
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:45,300
This is my cousin Helen.
Helen, this is Orlando.

542
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:49,400
Did I miss something?
You two know each other?

543
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,200
This is the sweet young lady...

544
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,400
that threw me out
of a moving truck.

545
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:56,000
This is the crazy woman--

546
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,400
That's her.

547
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,000
This town is too small.

548
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,400
I think you owe me an apology.

549
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,200
I don't owe you anything.

550
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,400
I was just trying
to help you out the other night.

551
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,400
Oh, yeah, right.
You're no good Samaritan.

552
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,100
He paid it. It's not like
you're some savior or something.

553
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,800
I'm gonna go...
check--do something.

554
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:17,300
Just another bitter
black woman, huh?

555
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,300
Excuse me?

556
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:22,800
I called you bitter, because
now every man you meet...

557
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,800
is gonna have to pay
for what he did.

558
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,400
You don't know
anything about me.

559
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,500
I know I watched a man
drag you out of a house...

560
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,000
and treat you like dirt.

561
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:33,800
Now there's another story
you can tell my cousin.

562
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,500
And I'm not bitter.
I'm mad as hell!

563
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:44,000
Turn that off up there.
Turn it off.

564
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,700
Shut up up there, all that
music.

565
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,200
How you doing, Henry Lee?

566
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,700
It's good to see y'all.

567
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,300
See, I'm on house arrest.

568
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,700
What is that?

569
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,200
You don't even
want to know, baby.

570
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,700
You don't even want to know.

571
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,600
Get somewhere and sit down
over there, little boy...

572
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:01,000
before I knock the hell
out of you. Where's your mama?

573
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:03,000
There you go.

574
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,700
-Mildred, you all right?
-Mm-hmm.

575
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:11,100
Mildred, don't you start
acting crazy.

576
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:13,400
Give me, give me. Here.
I'm gonna put this out.

577
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,100
You acting like you crazy.
I'll save that for later.

578
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,800
Your play, Mildred.

579
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,100
Play something.

580
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,200
Help! Somebody help me!

581
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,100
I'm out.

582
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,500
What happened to my eyes?

583
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,900
Everything is dark!

584
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,400
Open your eyes, and you might
be able to see something, fool.

585
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,300
Crawling all over me!
The rabbits!

586
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:45,200
The rabbits
are crawling all over me!

587
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,800
You ain't supposed to be
smoking that stuff, Mildred.

588
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,000
Rabbits!

589
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,800
Brian, please take her home
to her house.

590
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,200
I don't know why the hell
you come over here...

591
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,300
to my yard with that.

592
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,800
Get on, rabbit. Go, rabbit.

593
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:59,700
Go. Go, rabbit. Go.
OK, the rabbit's gone. OK?

594
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,300
All right. No more rabbits.

595
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,900
Hey, Mildred,
you forgot your rabbit.

596
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,800
Don't come back over here
no more, Mildred!

597
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,300
Don't come back over here!

598
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,500
I don't see no rabbit.

599
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,200
That was good stuff we had.

600
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,200
Is that a rab--
that's a rabbit!

601
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:25,400
Here. Use this.

602
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,500
What's this,
your way of apologizing?

603
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,600
Because if it is,
I'm not accepting it.

604
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:32,800
I'm sorry, mister.

605
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,900
Hey, hey.

606
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,500
My name's Orlando.

607
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,800
Orlando.

608
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:49,000
Willie, put some music on.
Something we can dance to.

609
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:50,800
You got it.

610
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,800
Let's turn this party up.
Y'all, come on. Dance.

611
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,400
Come on. Everybody come on.
Come on, Helen.

612
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,900
You and that young man.

613
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,700
Come on, young man. Come on.

614
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,600
March 19.

615
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:25,300
Dear diary...

616
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:28,800
I look out at my family
having fun and laughing...

617
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:32,100
and everything in me
is screaming for help.

618
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:35,500
How do I get to that place?

619
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,600
How?

620
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,600
Go, Joe! Go, Joe!

621
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,700
Go, Joe! Go, Joe!

622
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,700
Go, Joe! Go, Joe!

623
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,000
Hello?

624
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:06,200
Chuck, this is Jamison.
Man, I need to talk to you.

625
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,600
You know what time it is?

626
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,100
I don't really care
what time it is.

627
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:12,400
I got a situation.
We need to talk now.

628
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,600
It went bad.

629
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,100
What are you talking about?

630
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,600
-I shot him.
-Who?

631
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:24,000
Some cop undercover
who was trying to sting me.

632
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,800
What does that
got to do with me?

633
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,600
Charles,
I need a lawyer and a judge.

634
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:30,100
Now, there is $300,000
in that bag.

635
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:31,900
That ought to
buy me both, right?

636
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,500
Look, I'm a legitimate
defense attorney...

637
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:37,700
and I would advise you
not to try and bribe a judge.

638
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,300
Look, man, I'm hot!

639
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,400
I don't have time for
all this legal stuff, man.

640
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:44,600
OK, look, you know I don't deal
with your kind anymore.

641
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:47,000
My kind? Brother,
before you started...

642
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,700
defending all
these rich white boys...

643
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,600
it was my kind
that got you down.

644
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,300
-I'm going home.
-Home?

645
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,600
Oh, how quickly we forget.

646
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:57,100
I ran so much coke
for you back in the day...

647
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,700
I paid for that house.

648
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:04,100
Now look here. I need you,
like you needed me...

649
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:06,700
back in the day
to get all you got.

650
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:09,400
No. What you need
is a lawyer...

651
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,800
and not to ever
call my house again.

652
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:29,000
You are my lawyer.

653
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,300
You know where to find me.

654
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,300
Lord Jesus. All of this
calamity in the world.

655
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:48,100
But I tell--

656
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:51,300
The paper's sad.
It's really sad.

657
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,400
You nasty as hell.

658
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,300
I don't know what
I'm gonna do with you.

659
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,800
Here.

660
00:38:58,900 --> 00:38:59,800
What?

661
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,300
You need a job.

662
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,600
Oh, Madea, I don't--

663
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,400
I don't know
how to do anything.

664
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,100
I got a job for you...

665
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,500
as soon as I get
some more Vaseline.

666
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:13,300
Joe, that is your--
that's your family.

667
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,100
That's your dead husband's
side of the family.

668
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,100
She ain't no kin to me.

669
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,300
I could introduce you to Harvey.
Maybe he'll help you out.

670
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,700
She ain't selling no dope, Joe.

671
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,800
If I had a bottle
of battery acid...

672
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,000
I would give you
a chemical peel...

673
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:29,700
just scrub all of that ugly
off of your face.

674
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,300
I know you're my brother...

675
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,800
and the only reason I'm
letting you stay in my house...

676
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,500
is to get your check.

677
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,400
But I can still
get your check...

678
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,900
if you come up missing.
Keep trying me.

679
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:41,500
But you're gonna end up
in the Chattahoochee river.

680
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:44,800
What you looking at?!

681
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:46,500
You ain't moving in here.

682
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,300
Next thing you know,
she'll be getting mail here.

683
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,300
Joe, leave that baby alone.

684
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,900
If their name
comes on the envelope...

685
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,500
that means they move
right the hell in.

686
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,000
Get out.

687
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:57,400
Get--get out.

688
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:00,000
Baby, take that newspaper...

689
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:02,400
and go on in the kitchen
and look for you a job.

690
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:03,800
And an apartment.

691
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:06,100
Look for an apartment
while you're in there.

692
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,800
You always messing
with somebody.

693
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:09,500
What the hell's wrong with you?

694
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,100
You're just grouchy as hell.
You been grouchy.

695
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,300
That's why Mommy and Daddy
didn't like you.

696
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,500
She ain't moving in here.

697
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,800
Ain't enough room in this house
for all of us here.

698
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:20,800
This ain't "Roots." These rooms
are barely big enough...

699
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,300
for you to turn around in.

700
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,200
Man, but you know,
you're just huge.

701
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:27,300
You big as a Buick.
You just fat as hell.

702
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,100
I watched you walk
down the hall the other day.

703
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:31,300
I thought somebody had put
a refrigerator on your butt.

704
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:32,800
You're huge. You're big.

705
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:35,000
And that's something
you'll never...

706
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,700
in your life hear a woman say.

707
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,500
Yes!

708
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,000
Thank you, Mrs. McCarter.

709
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,700
She's in her room.

710
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:46,100
Hi, Mama.

711
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,800
Hi.

712
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:54,000
I brought you some things.

713
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,500
Hey, baby. How you doing?

714
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:05,200
Oh. I'm doing OK.

715
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:08,100
Yeah.

716
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:13,800
They talked to me
about the bill here yesterday.

717
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,200
They call you?

718
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:17,500
Yes.

719
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,900
I'm gonna get that paid.

720
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:22,100
You know Charles
don't care nothing about me.

721
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,400
What makes you think
he's gonna pay it?

722
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:26,900
I talked to Madea.

723
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,300
I know what's going on.

724
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,300
I think I'm...

725
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:37,100
losing my mind, Mama.

726
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,200
He hurt me so bad.

727
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,200
He was my everything.

728
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:50,300
God is your everything.

729
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,700
Don't you know
he's a jealous god?

730
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:55,500
He don't want no man before him.

731
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,800
I don't even know
where to begin...

732
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:02,000
to pick up the pieces
of my life.

733
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:03,600
Lord have mercy.

734
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:09,300
I was 39 years old
when you were born.

735
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:13,100
I never ever dreamed
I'd have children.

736
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,800
And then here you come...

737
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:17,900
sweet bundle of joy.

738
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:22,200
But what did I do?

739
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,800
I think I shielded you
way too much.

740
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,600
Now you got to get out there...

741
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:34,700
try to stand
on your own two feet.

742
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,600
Oh, no, Mama.

743
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:39,300
I can't do that.
I'm not strong like you.

744
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,300
Sure you are.

745
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:47,300
You got the strength
God gave us women to survive.

746
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:50,100
You just ain't
tapped into it yet.

747
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:57,000
Come here.

748
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,300
Come on.

749
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,800
Come on now.

750
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:07,500
Oh...

751
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,800
just let it go.

752
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:16,800
Nothing wrong with
shedding a few tears.

753
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:19,000
It cleanses the soul.

754
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:25,000
You know, you need
to stop thinking...

755
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,800
about what you think
you lost...

756
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:30,800
and look forward
to what there is to gain.

757
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:32,800
It's a new life, baby.

758
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:35,700
It's right in front of you.

759
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:38,800
All you got to do
is reach out and grab it.

760
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:44,900
How do I do that, Mama? How?

761
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:50,300
By waking up every morning...

762
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:53,300
and thanking God that you did.

763
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:57,300
And then ask him to help you.

764
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:00,600
Just ask the savior to help you.

765
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:17,500
April 18.

766
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:20,400
Dear diary,
every day I wake up...

767
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:24,000
I take my mother's advice.

768
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Most days, I don't want
to get out of bed...

769
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,300
but I do.

770
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:32,500
Some people say,
"One day at a time."

771
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:35,300
Seems too long for me.

772
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:39,100
Most days, all I can do
is moment to moment.

773
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,300
The good thing
about being this low...

774
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:46,500
is that there's
nowhere to go but up.

775
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:50,000
Hi. Can I get your order?

776
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:51,100
Hi.

777
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:55,800
OK, I'm gonna kill Brian.
Did he tell you I work here?

778
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:57,300
Hey, easy. Easy.

779
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:59,800
A man's got to eat, right?

780
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:02,000
What can I get for you?

781
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,100
How about a coffee
and a number four?

782
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:08,300
We don't have number fours
in this restaurant.

783
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,700
OK. How about just a coffee?

784
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:13,100
Coffee.

785
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:15,000
OK.

786
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:18,300
I like the new haircut...

787
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,700
a lot.

788
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,800
Thank you.

789
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,500
Oh, no matter what

790
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:37,100
You may be going through

791
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,100
Take it to the master

792
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,500
He'll see you right on through

793
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:43,800
I know Jesus, whoo!

794
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:45,500
Take it to him

795
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:48,600
You can leave it there

796
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:51,100
He will work it out

797
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,500
No matter what

798
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:56,800
You may be going through...

799
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:58,500
April 25.

800
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:03,000
Dear diary,
today was a bad day.

801
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:06,900
I got up and came to church
because I was so angry.

802
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,900
When I think
about all the blood...

803
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,900
and sweat and tears
I put into my marriage...

804
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,900
it makes me want to hate him.

805
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,700
Let me tell you something, boss.

806
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:18,600
I paid you a lot of money,
and that judge, he ain't down.

807
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:20,100
The judge had no choice...

808
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:21,900
but to allow the videotape
into evidence.

809
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,100
I told you
to make this go away.

810
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:26,400
Say it wasn't me,
I wasn't there.

811
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:29,100
How the hell do you
use self-defense?

812
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,600
You're on videotape.

813
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:32,100
And it will be
very hard to explain...

814
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,000
you not being there
at the time of the murder.

815
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,600
Self-defense is our only option.

816
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:37,800
Then put me on the stand.
I'll say it wasn't me.

817
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:39,500
Then all your priors
come into play.

818
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:42,700
Look, Mr. Jackson,
you have to let me work here.

819
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:45,100
Look, man, you can get me off,
make this go away.

820
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,700
Look, I said
I would do all I can.

821
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,800
Well, that better be
a hell of a lot, brother.

822
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:50,300
Or I will do all I can.

823
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,800
Wait a minute.
Are you threatening--

824
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:53,800
Ain't nobody talking to you.

825
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:56,800
I done paid you a lot of money.

826
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:59,500
You know how it is
on the streets, Chuck.

827
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:01,800
Brother don't do what he say.

828
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:05,800
However you and your homeys
settle your disputes...

829
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:08,300
this has to play out in court.

830
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:11,300
-If I go down, man--
-If you go down?

831
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:13,300
Kalvin, walk away.

832
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:14,800
Walk away.

833
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:24,300
Don't let this suit fool you.

834
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:28,300
I don't take too kindly
to threats, Mr. Jackson.

835
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:32,800
And I don't make
idle threats, Mr. McCarter.

836
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:35,500
I better get off.

837
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:46,300
May 12.

838
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,100
Dear diary...

839
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:52,100
I'm beginning to find my way.

840
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:54,600
It's been close to
three months...

841
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:58,300
and every day
gets a little easier.

842
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,600
Even though we're still
battling Charles in court...

843
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:04,600
I don't even give it
that much energy anymore.

844
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:07,100
I don't understand this,
but it's strange...

845
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:10,000
how little can be so much
when you're happy.

846
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,700
I find myself
smiling and laughing...

847
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:16,000
more than I ever have.

848
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:18,600
I find myself...

849
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:23,100
Wait a minute. That's it.

850
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,300
I'm finding myself.

851
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:35,100
It's nights like this
I wish I had a car...

852
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:38,000
or kept that U-Haul truck
a few more days.

853
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,500
Hey. Brian asked me
to pick you up tonight.

854
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:02,000
He did?

855
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,100
No, thanks.

856
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:05,500
All right, but you know...

857
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:07,700
the next bus doesn't come
for at least an hour.

858
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:11,100
I'll be fine.

859
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:13,900
Why are you being
so mean, woman?

860
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:17,100
Why are you being
so nice, man?

861
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:20,600
You know, there are still
a few of us nice guys around.

862
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:23,000
All right. Suit yourself.

863
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:26,400
Come on, now.
This makes no sense.

864
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:29,200
You'll take me straight home?

865
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:31,000
I'll take you wherever
you want to go.

866
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:33,100
Just get in the truck.

867
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:34,200
Come on.

868
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:41,400
You all right?

869
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:42,600
Yeah.

870
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:00,500
This is some weather, huh?

871
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:06,000
Hey, you know what?
I'm kind of hungry.

872
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:08,700
You want to stop
and have some dinner?

873
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,400
I have food at home.

874
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,300
I was thinking you might like...

875
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:15,500
a nice little salmon dinner
at one of my favorite spots.

876
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:17,600
Where is that? McDonald's?

877
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:21,300
Actually, it's a little
jazz bar called Chandra's.

878
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:26,100
I love that place.

879
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:29,100
There you go. All right. So?

880
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:30,500
Are we going?

881
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:34,600
-I can't afford Chandra's.
-No, no, no, no. I got it.

882
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:36,000
You got it?

883
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:37,700
Yeah, I got it.

884
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,900
And what do you do?

885
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,100
Because I don't hang
with drug dealers.

886
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:46,300
I work twelve hours a day
at McWorth steel, all right?

887
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:49,100
I got the bill.

888
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:52,400
Yeah. Well, this is not a date.

889
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:54,500
Yes, ma'am.

890
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:28,700
What are you looking at?

891
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:33,300
A beautiful black woman.

892
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:37,600
Is that all you see
when you look at me?

893
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:40,300
No. No, not at all.

894
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:45,100
I also see a woman
who's been hurt...

895
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:46,700
a lot...

896
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:50,200
and she's taught herself
how to be tough...

897
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:52,200
real tough.

898
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:56,300
But, you know, the key
is to be tough, not hard.

899
00:53:56,300 --> 00:54:00,100
And how would you know
what the key is?

900
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:04,500
Let's just say
I had to learn it, too.

901
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:08,400
Is that what you tell
all your women?

902
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:13,700
I don't have women.

903
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:20,100
I had a bad breakup last year.

904
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:24,600
And I guess
you could say I've...

905
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:27,600
I've been happily single
ever since.

906
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:33,400
Well, I guess...

907
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:36,100
we've both had
bad breakups, then.

908
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:38,900
Hello. Welcome to Chandra's.

909
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,800
I'm Chandra Currelley.

910
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:46,300
This one is
for the new couples...

911
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,700
here for the very first time
tonight.

912
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:56,000
How do I start?

913
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:03,700
Where do I begin?

914
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:08,400
I've been hurt so much

915
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:12,400
I just need a friend

916
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:16,200
Could it be you?

917
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:22,100
Will you break
through these walls?

918
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:24,300
Are you willing

919
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:28,000
To help them fall?

920
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:34,800
I want to love again...

921
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:39,400
So, what did you do?

922
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:42,400
What?

923
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:44,600
Well, men always do something.

924
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:47,900
Did her looks change?

925
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:49,900
Did you grow tired of her?

926
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:51,100
No.

927
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,700
She decided she wanted
a pro ball player.

928
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:59,200
He had a lot more money
than I had.

929
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:03,600
I'm sorry.

930
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:07,400
It's not a big deal.

931
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:09,400
...with you

932
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:15,000
You don't know that

933
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:16,800
These...

934
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:19,200
Dance with me.

935
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:22,500
No. I'm in my uniform.

936
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:24,300
So what? Who cares?
Look at me. Come on.

937
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:25,400
No, no, no.

938
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:30,900
Is driving me crazy

939
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:35,900
Oh, my mind,
my mind says no

940
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:41,200
But my body says yes

941
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:42,700
You're...

942
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:44,900
Dear diary...

943
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:49,000
this man is fine.

944
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:53,200
How does he know
I like to be held like this?

945
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:54,900
Am I holding you too tight?

946
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:58,400
Lord knows, I wanted to say,
"Yes. Back the hell up."

947
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:02,300
But he felt so good.

948
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:04,700
It's OK.

949
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:07,700
Dear Jesus,
please let this man let me go...

950
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:09,700
before I lose my mind.

951
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:15,600
And he smells so good.

952
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:18,000
What's the catch?

953
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:20,000
Please let him
say something stupid...

954
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:21,900
like all men do at this time.

955
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,200
You know,
this feels like a fairy tale.

956
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:27,500
No, he didn't!

957
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:30,000
That was the right thing.

958
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:33,400
What do you mean?

959
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:36,700
Just me holding you like this.

960
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:43,100
I used to believe
in fairy tales, but...

961
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:45,600
I don't anymore.

962
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:50,000
And I'll, I'll do the rest

963
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:53,900
Your every smile,
your gentle touch

964
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:57,400
I've...

965
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:00,100
never been this close
to any man...

966
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:05,000
other than my husband--
my ex-husband.

967
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:10,200
Charles--that's his name.

968
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:17,200
He was supposed
to be my fairy tale.

969
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:20,400
He was my first...

970
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,600
and my only.

971
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:44,000
Here it is.

972
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:45,500
Thank you.

973
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:47,000
You're welcome.

974
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:49,100
You know,
I'd like to see you again...

975
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:50,600
if that's all right.

976
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:59,700
Orlando, I'm just getting
out of a relationship and--

977
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:05,100
You know, it's so easy to say no
sometimes out of fear.

978
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:07,900
So how about just taking
the hard road...

979
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:10,100
and saying yes?

980
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:12,400
Just this one time.

981
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:16,900
I mean, what's so wrong
about being friends?

982
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:21,700
Nothing, I guess.

983
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:25,400
Yeah. Nothing.

984
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:28,600
So, I'll see you tomorrow?

985
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:34,500
So, you're asking me out again?

986
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:38,900
This wasn't a date, remember?

987
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:48,100
-OK, I'll see you tomorrow.
-There you go.

988
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:49,700
I'll see you tomorrow.

989
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:53,600
-You got it?
-I'm trapped.

990
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:55,700
It's old-school. I got it.

991
00:59:57,500 --> 01:00:00,100
-I'll see you tomorrow.
-OK.

992
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:07,300
-Good night.
-Good night.

993
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:45,700
When you're finished,
you need to leave.

994
01:00:47,700 --> 01:00:50,200
Leave?
I don't have nowhere to go.

995
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:53,900
What do you want me to do?

996
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:58,800
Open the house up to you?
Give you the keys?

997
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:00,500
You put me and these
kids through enough.

998
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:02,100
You need to go.

999
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:09,600
You still have that picture.

1000
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:14,400
What happened to us?

1001
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:16,800
You.

1002
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:27,400
I don't want to do this
anymore, Brian.

1003
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:30,800
Help me, please.

1004
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:33,800
No. Every time
I try to help you...

1005
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:35,000
you disappoint me.

1006
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:36,900
This time,
you got to help yourself.

1007
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,400
But I can't.

1008
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:42,000
God knows how many times
we've been through this.

1009
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:43,700
You say that every time,
and I wake up...

1010
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:45,800
the next morning,
my wallet is gone.

1011
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:48,500
No, but I'm serious
this time, Brian.

1012
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:49,800
Come on, please.

1013
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:51,400
I can make you feel good.

1014
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:53,600
Don't you want to feel good?

1015
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:00,500
It's time to go.

1016
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:08,600
I really am trying.

1017
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:53,100
Damn thing working
on my nerves.

1018
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:57,700
You know, I was watching
the Animal Planet channel...

1019
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:01,800
and they say that
when a coyote is trapped...

1020
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:06,600
it will eat its own foots off
to get out of the trap.

1021
01:04:06,700 --> 01:04:08,100
You want some hot sauce?

1022
01:04:12,300 --> 01:04:14,500
In your case,
it wouldn't be a coyote.

1023
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:17,000
It would be a elephant!

1024
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:18,900
A big old giraffe!

1025
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,400
A big old giraffe!

1026
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:23,400
Say one more thing, Joe.

1027
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:26,700
Say one more thing.

1028
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:31,300
I don't hear you. You're quiet.
Can I buy a vowel?

1029
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,500
It's open!

1030
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:37,900
Come on, Tiffany.

1031
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:43,400
Hey. Got to drop the kids off
because I got to go to court.

1032
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:45,600
My cigarettes.

1033
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:47,600
How you doing? You all right?

1034
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:51,000
Hey there, little boy.
What's going on?

1035
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:53,800
How you doing?
Good to see you, B.J.

1036
01:04:53,900 --> 01:04:55,300
What's wrong with you?

1037
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:56,600
She wants to sing
in that church choir.

1038
01:04:56,700 --> 01:04:58,000
You can join in at twelve.

1039
01:04:58,100 --> 01:05:01,000
Go on in there and watch TV.
Let me talk to your daddy.

1040
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:04,700
Madea, I don't want to hear it.
She's not singing in that choir.

1041
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:06,900
Roll your eyes at me,
get slapped.

1042
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:09,600
Brian, just because singing
led Debrah to drugs...

1043
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:12,300
don't mean the same thing is
gonna happen to your daughter.

1044
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:14,700
And why you put Debrah out of
the house the other night?

1045
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:16,400
You need to try to help her.

1046
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:19,800
Hell, no! Don't do that.
That is stupid!

1047
01:05:19,900 --> 01:05:22,200
I've done all I can, Madea.

1048
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:24,600
You right. You right.
Let me tell you something...

1049
01:05:24,700 --> 01:05:26,000
what I learned.

1050
01:05:26,100 --> 01:05:30,000
You can't turn no whore
into no housewife.

1051
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:33,000
I'm telling him.
I tried it with your mama.

1052
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:36,500
Whoo, that was terrible.
Come on. Let's go out there.

1053
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:39,800
Madea, I can't keep putting
these kids through this, OK?

1054
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:42,200
Brian, you is using them
children like a crutch.

1055
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:43,900
You understand
what I'm telling you?

1056
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:47,100
Any fool could see you love
that woman with all your might.

1057
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:48,800
You need to help her.

1058
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:50,800
And at the same time,
it might help you.

1059
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:53,800
Don't do it! Don't do it!

1060
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:55,600
Don't do it, I say!

1061
01:05:57,500 --> 01:05:59,700
Don't do it!

1062
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:02,300
Listen, you take your daughter
on down there...

1063
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:04,400
and let her sing
in that church choir.

1064
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:06,400
That is constructive,
what she's doing.

1065
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:08,600
She need to do
something constructive.

1066
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:11,500
Love is stronger
than any addiction, baby.

1067
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:13,100
Hell, it is one.

1068
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:15,700
You got time to eat?

1069
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:22,500
August 30.

1070
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:24,000
Dear diary...

1071
01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:26,700
some random thoughts for you.

1072
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:31,000
Orlando and I have been out
every night since Chandra's.

1073
01:06:31,100 --> 01:06:34,700
That was almost four months.

1074
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:37,300
I keep waiting
for him to change...

1075
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:40,100
to be this evil person...

1076
01:06:40,100 --> 01:06:42,900
but it hasn't happened.

1077
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:45,700
I didn't know a man
could be so thoughtful.

1078
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:48,800
It's like second nature.

1079
01:07:04,100 --> 01:07:05,100
What?

1080
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:09,000
I'm just sitting here
trying to think of a way...

1081
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:10,300
to say this to you.

1082
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
I'm in love with you.

1083
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:23,400
How do you know that?

1084
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:26,300
I don't know
how to explain it to you.

1085
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:31,800
Try.

1086
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:40,800
Helen, if I'm away from you
for more than an hour...

1087
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:43,100
I can't stop thinking about you.

1088
01:07:46,100 --> 01:07:48,600
I carry you in my spirit.

1089
01:07:48,700 --> 01:07:52,800
I pray for you more
than I pray for myself.

1090
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:56,300
I got it so bad for you,
I'd go to the grocery store...

1091
01:07:56,300 --> 01:07:59,400
and I'd buy your feminine
products. I swear I would.

1092
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,300
See? And that. That.

1093
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:06,700
That smile.

1094
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:09,500
Helen, when you smile
like that...

1095
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:13,100
my world...
it's all right.

1096
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:18,600
I am in love with you.

1097
01:08:32,300 --> 01:08:36,200
Dear diary,
when did I get here?

1098
01:08:36,300 --> 01:08:38,900
Somewhere,
out of all the pain...

1099
01:08:38,900 --> 01:08:42,000
came a man who is strong...

1100
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:45,600
beautiful, sensitive...

1101
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:48,100
and Christian.

1102
01:08:48,100 --> 01:08:51,400
Last night was so amazing.

1103
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:54,200
Even though we both wanted
to make love...

1104
01:08:54,300 --> 01:08:57,400
he chose to give me
something better.

1105
01:08:57,500 --> 01:09:00,100
He gave me intimacy.

1106
01:09:03,300 --> 01:09:06,100
I haven't felt this way in...

1107
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:09,900
well...never.

1108
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:14,300
You know, what's strange
is that I thank Charles...

1109
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:18,200
because if he hadn't been
such a terrible man to me...

1110
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:21,700
I wouldn't know
what a good one feels like.

1111
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:26,200
He can have it all.

1112
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:28,700
Your Honor, may I have a moment
to confer with my client?

1113
01:09:28,700 --> 01:09:29,900
It's fine.

1114
01:09:33,900 --> 01:09:35,600
It's fine.

1115
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:40,600
Your Honor, let him
have it all...everything.

1116
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:45,400
Are you sure?

1117
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:47,600
Yes...

1118
01:09:47,700 --> 01:09:51,000
as long as he agrees
to pay my attorney's fees...

1119
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:54,400
and my mother's stay
in a nursing home...

1120
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:56,000
he can have it.

1121
01:09:57,700 --> 01:10:00,700
So ordered. Mr. McCarter
will retain ownership...

1122
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:04,300
of all said properties solely,
and no alimony is ordered.

1123
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:07,800
Mr. McCarter will pay all
Mrs. McCarter's attorney fees.

1124
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:09,700
Divorce will be granted...

1125
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:14,200
upon the signature of
both parties after thirty days.

1126
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:15,600
Adjourned.

1127
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:21,700
Do you have any idea
what you just did?

1128
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:24,100
Yes.

1129
01:10:29,900 --> 01:10:32,000
Smart choice.

1130
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:33,600
Later, Charles.

1131
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:38,600
Smart choice.

1132
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:14,300
Will the defendant please rise?

1133
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:21,400
Mr. Foreman, has the jury
reached a unanimous verdict?

1134
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:25,300
We have, your Honor.

1135
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:26,400
What say you?

1136
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:29,100
We, the jury,
find the defendant...

1137
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:32,400
Jamison Milton Jackson,
guilty.

1138
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
Quiet. Quiet.

1139
01:11:36,100 --> 01:11:37,300
Quiet.

1140
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:41,800
I'd like to thank the members
of the jury for their duties.

1141
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:43,100
Take him away.

1142
01:11:43,100 --> 01:11:45,700
Sentencing will be
in three weeks.

1143
01:11:45,700 --> 01:11:47,400
This court is adjourned.

1144
01:11:47,500 --> 01:11:50,200
Good looking out.

1145
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:04,800
Somebody get an ambulance!

1146
01:12:04,900 --> 01:12:07,200
Hurry! We need
an ambulance, please!

1147
01:12:07,300 --> 01:12:10,300
Will someone get some help?

1148
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,800
Do you love me?

1149
01:12:36,100 --> 01:12:37,600
Hey.

1150
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:42,400
Hey. Hey.

1151
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:47,100
Helen, my heart says
that you do.

1152
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:49,400
Your actions say that you do.

1153
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:53,100
But you've never said it.

1154
01:12:54,700 --> 01:12:56,600
The last man that I said--

1155
01:12:56,700 --> 01:12:58,500
No, no, no, no.

1156
01:13:00,700 --> 01:13:02,400
Please...

1157
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:06,700
don't make me pay
for his mistakes.

1158
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:11,000
If you love me, just say it...

1159
01:13:11,100 --> 01:13:13,100
and you trust me
with that information...

1160
01:13:13,100 --> 01:13:16,100
because I promise you
I won't abuse it.

1161
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,100
But I need to hear it.

1162
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:28,800
Yes...

1163
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:30,800
I love you.

1164
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:38,000
Now what?

1165
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,900
That's it. That's it.

1166
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,400
You just trust it.

1167
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:46,100
OK?

1168
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:48,600
Any time you want
to give in to that fear...

1169
01:13:48,700 --> 01:13:50,800
you let our love outweigh it.

1170
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:54,200
Right?

1171
01:13:55,300 --> 01:13:57,000
-Yeah?
-OK.

1172
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:14,900
Good morning.

1173
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:56,800
Orlando, what's going--

1174
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:10,600
I know you don't believe
in fairy tales.

1175
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:15,300
But if you did...

1176
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:20,500
I'd want to be your knight
in shining armor.

1177
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:26,800
You've been through so much.

1178
01:15:26,900 --> 01:15:31,000
I don't want
to see you hurt anymore.

1179
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:36,800
Now, I may not be able to give
you all that you're used to.

1180
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:41,300
But I do know I can love you
past your pain.

1181
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:47,600
I don't want you
to worry about anything.

1182
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:52,000
You just wake up
in the morning.

1183
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,700
That's all you have to do,
and I'll take it from there.

1184
01:16:00,900 --> 01:16:03,600
There's one condition.

1185
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:19,100
You have to be my wife.

1186
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,700
Say something.

1187
01:16:53,300 --> 01:16:56,800
What? What's wrong?

1188
01:16:56,900 --> 01:16:58,400
-Oh, my God.
-What?

1189
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:00,300
What's wrong?

1190
01:17:02,100 --> 01:17:03,800
-What?
-I have to go.

1191
01:17:03,900 --> 01:17:05,200
Go? Go where?

1192
01:17:05,300 --> 01:17:06,300
I'm sorry.

1193
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:09,700
-Where are you going?
-I have to go.

1194
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:14,700
We removed two
of the four bullets...

1195
01:17:14,700 --> 01:17:17,000
but there's one that's
very close to the spine.

1196
01:17:17,100 --> 01:17:18,500
There's a great possibility...

1197
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:20,000
he could be
permanently paralyzed.

1198
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:21,400
Are you his wife?

1199
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:23,700
I am soon to be.
He won't be able to walk?

1200
01:17:23,700 --> 01:17:25,000
It's touch-and-go
at this point.

1201
01:17:25,100 --> 01:17:26,500
We're trying
to stabilize him...

1202
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:27,900
so we can perform
this last surgery...

1203
01:17:27,900 --> 01:17:30,200
but this bullet
is in a very difficult place.

1204
01:17:30,300 --> 01:17:31,700
I need to know,
if things go badly...

1205
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:33,200
should we resuscitate?

1206
01:17:33,300 --> 01:17:35,400
What do you mean,
"If things go bad"?

1207
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:38,900
I have to be honest with you.
It doesn't look good in there.

1208
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
Should we resuscitate?

1209
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,000
No.

1210
01:17:42,100 --> 01:17:43,700
-Wait a minute.
-Excuse me?

1211
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:46,500
I'm sorry. These decisions
are usually left to the spouse.

1212
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:50,100
No, no, no.
Legally, she is still his wife.

1213
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:52,700
Then you have to make the call.

1214
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:56,300
You do everything
you can for him.

1215
01:18:00,100 --> 01:18:03,200
You are so vindictive!

1216
01:18:03,300 --> 01:18:06,800
What quality of life is that man
gonna have if he can't walk?

1217
01:18:06,900 --> 01:18:10,100
Did you not hear her
say "possibility"?

1218
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:12,600
Why are you here?

1219
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:15,000
Helen, calm down.

1220
01:18:15,100 --> 01:18:16,600
Why are you here?!

1221
01:18:16,700 --> 01:18:19,000
Let me go.

1222
01:18:19,100 --> 01:18:21,200
OK.

1223
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:23,300
I'm fine.

1224
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:36,200
September 1.

1225
01:18:36,300 --> 01:18:40,500
Dear diary, tell me,
why am I here?

1226
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:43,000
I know it's the Christian
thing to do...

1227
01:18:43,100 --> 01:18:47,100
but my flesh wants to beat
the hell out of him.

1228
01:18:47,100 --> 01:18:49,600
I want to hate him...

1229
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:52,100
but as I look at him...

1230
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:54,800
all I feel is sympathy.

1231
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:12,000
Charles?

1232
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:15,400
Hi.

1233
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:16,700
Hi.

1234
01:19:16,700 --> 01:19:18,700
He came through pretty well.

1235
01:19:20,300 --> 01:19:22,400
He can't speak,
but he can hear you.

1236
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:24,500
What about the paralysis?

1237
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:28,000
Mr. McCarter,
it's Dr. Shiloh.

1238
01:19:28,100 --> 01:19:31,000
If you can feel this,
I want you to blink your eyes.

1239
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:45,500
Don't get discouraged.

1240
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:47,100
It's not as bad as we thought.

1241
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:48,900
He is breathing on his own.

1242
01:19:48,900 --> 01:19:51,500
He's suffered a lot of scarring
and swelling...

1243
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:53,600
around the nerves
of the spine...

1244
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:55,200
but as the swelling goes down...

1245
01:19:55,300 --> 01:19:59,600
it's possible that he will
be able to regain some feeling.

1246
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:01,300
Don't give up.

1247
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:07,700
September 19.

1248
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:09,800
Dear diary...

1249
01:20:09,900 --> 01:20:11,400
as I sit here thinking about...

1250
01:20:11,500 --> 01:20:15,700
picking up the pieces
of what used to be my life...

1251
01:20:15,700 --> 01:20:17,700
I realized something.

1252
01:20:17,700 --> 01:20:23,500
Every room in this house
holds a painful memory for me.

1253
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:25,200
Even though he's suffering...

1254
01:20:25,300 --> 01:20:29,100
something somewhere in me
wants him to suffer more.

1255
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:31,000
A few months and a divorce...

1256
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,900
can take you through
just as many emotions...

1257
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,100
as 18 years in a marriage.

1258
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:40,300
And I'm starting to feel
all of them at once.

1259
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:45,100
But the one that is clear
is rage.

1260
01:20:45,100 --> 01:20:48,700
Signed, a mad black woman.

1261
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:57,400
I don't see it.

1262
01:20:57,500 --> 01:20:59,400
-You don't see it?
-No.

1263
01:20:59,500 --> 01:21:01,100
You ain't good for nothing.

1264
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:04,700
Find my bank statement and get
the accountant on the phone.

1265
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:06,200
Then call Kalvin
and tell him...

1266
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:07,800
to get over here,
and you could leave.

1267
01:21:07,900 --> 01:21:09,900
This is not gonna beat me.

1268
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:12,900
What you starin' at?

1269
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,500
All of this,
and you're still the same.

1270
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:17,200
I'm Charles McCarter.

1271
01:21:17,300 --> 01:21:19,200
I'm gonna die Charles McCarter.

1272
01:21:19,300 --> 01:21:21,200
Look, I don't even know
why you're here.

1273
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:24,300
I ain't giving you a dime.
Call Brenda and get my kids.

1274
01:21:24,300 --> 01:21:27,500
Where are my kids?
Look, just get the hell out.

1275
01:21:27,500 --> 01:21:30,600
I ask you to do
one little thing...

1276
01:21:30,700 --> 01:21:33,400
and you can't even do that
after 18 years?

1277
01:21:35,300 --> 01:21:37,600
Get out!

1278
01:21:56,800 --> 01:22:00,900
Let me explain something to you.

1279
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:05,500
Old Helen is gone...

1280
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:08,600
and you will not
talk to me like that.

1281
01:22:08,700 --> 01:22:13,900
Now, I came here
to help you...

1282
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,200
but now...

1283
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:19,000
I'm gonna get even.

1284
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:21,600
-Helen, you--
-Shut up!

1285
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:29,100
You want Brenda and your kids?

1286
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:32,000
Do you see what you left me for?

1287
01:22:32,100 --> 01:22:34,700
This is what you left me for!

1288
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:37,800
She didn't give a damn
about you, Charles.

1289
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:40,600
She told them to let you die.

1290
01:22:40,700 --> 01:22:43,900
I was your wife. I loved you.

1291
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,100
I never would have hurt you!

1292
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:48,700
Why did you do this to me?

1293
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:51,400
To us?

1294
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:54,100
Answer me!

1295
01:22:59,300 --> 01:23:03,000
And you know what's funny?

1296
01:23:03,100 --> 01:23:05,700
I gave you life...

1297
01:23:05,700 --> 01:23:08,600
even though
you took it from me.

1298
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:13,300
Your kids...

1299
01:23:14,700 --> 01:23:17,100
your boys...

1300
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:22,600
I wanted children, Charles!

1301
01:23:22,700 --> 01:23:25,000
And had you not been
with those whores...

1302
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:28,200
we would have them.

1303
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:30,400
Got me all stressed out--

1304
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:33,200
my hair falling out,
my weight up and down...

1305
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:36,200
can't keep anything down,
two miscarriages!

1306
01:23:36,300 --> 01:23:38,500
You took life from me...

1307
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:41,600
and you never even said,
"I'm sorry."

1308
01:23:49,300 --> 01:23:52,100
I'm gonna let you sit here
for a few days...

1309
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,600
and think about what I've said.

1310
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:18,700
You stink.

1311
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:25,600
Helen, what you doing?

1312
01:24:25,700 --> 01:24:27,500
Hey! Stop it! Stop it!

1313
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:29,400
Hey, stop!

1314
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:45,200
"Bathe him, feed him...

1315
01:24:45,300 --> 01:24:48,100
"clothe him," they say.

1316
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:50,500
What about me?

1317
01:24:54,100 --> 01:24:57,000
What about me?

1318
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:06,800
Oh, stop making those bubbles.

1319
01:25:15,100 --> 01:25:18,200
You kicked me
out of our house!

1320
01:25:18,300 --> 01:25:22,200
You tried to keep me
from our money!

1321
01:25:22,300 --> 01:25:23,700
No.

1322
01:25:48,500 --> 01:25:50,700
I was there...

1323
01:25:50,700 --> 01:25:54,300
when all we had was each other.

1324
01:26:16,900 --> 01:26:18,200
Helen.

1325
01:26:19,900 --> 01:26:21,500
Are you hungry?

1326
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:27,700
Maybe you should
go into the kitchen...

1327
01:26:27,700 --> 01:26:31,100
and get yourself
something to eat then.

1328
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:34,200
Christina.

1329
01:26:35,700 --> 01:26:37,700
Christina?

1330
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:43,100
Christina's gone.

1331
01:26:44,500 --> 01:26:46,700
Your little tramp didn't leave
any money to pay her...

1332
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:51,100
so she left,
just like your little slut.

1333
01:26:51,100 --> 01:26:53,700
She packed all her things--
and some of yours--

1334
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:55,500
and left.

1335
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:01,800
Come to think of it...

1336
01:27:01,900 --> 01:27:04,500
she cleaned out
your bank account...

1337
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:05,800
all of it.

1338
01:27:05,900 --> 01:27:09,900
You tried to keep it from me,
and she took it all.

1339
01:27:20,900 --> 01:27:22,600
Lord have mercy.

1340
01:27:26,300 --> 01:27:30,400
Charles,
you are like so many men.

1341
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:34,900
You'd rather leave with trash...

1342
01:27:34,900 --> 01:27:38,200
than make it work
with a good woman.

1343
01:27:42,100 --> 01:27:43,600
You're a coward.

1344
01:28:00,500 --> 01:28:02,400
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

1345
01:28:14,300 --> 01:28:15,500
Hi.

1346
01:28:20,100 --> 01:28:23,200
I thought you were
gonna stand me up.

1347
01:28:23,300 --> 01:28:24,600
No.

1348
01:28:27,100 --> 01:28:30,100
Can I get a cranberry juice,
please?

1349
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:33,500
Helen, I haven't heard
from you in three weeks.

1350
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:35,400
What's going on?

1351
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:44,100
I have a lot of things
going on right now, Orlando...

1352
01:28:44,200 --> 01:28:48,200
and I don't think
I can complicate it.

1353
01:28:48,300 --> 01:28:50,400
Complicate it?

1354
01:28:50,500 --> 01:28:52,600
I'm a complication?

1355
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:57,600
Thank you.

1356
01:29:00,100 --> 01:29:02,400
My husband's back home.

1357
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:06,600
We're back together.

1358
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:13,700
Helen, don't you do this.

1359
01:29:13,700 --> 01:29:15,900
That man did everything
in his power...

1360
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,100
to try and break you,
but you made it.

1361
01:29:18,200 --> 01:29:20,400
You found strength
and passion for life...

1362
01:29:20,500 --> 01:29:23,500
you never had before.
Why would you turn back?

1363
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:24,900
Why?

1364
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:32,800
You can't answer me, can you?

1365
01:29:32,900 --> 01:29:38,000
Well, I know the answer,
because I was just like you.

1366
01:29:38,100 --> 01:29:39,800
Every time things
were going good...

1367
01:29:39,900 --> 01:29:41,600
I would always find a way
to mess it up.

1368
01:29:41,700 --> 01:29:45,000
I would sabotage,
just like you're doing.

1369
01:29:45,100 --> 01:29:47,000
But, Helen,
I learned that I do deserve...

1370
01:29:47,100 --> 01:29:49,000
to have good things
and a good life.

1371
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,100
And I deserve you.

1372
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:55,500
Helen, look at me.

1373
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:57,700
Look at me.

1374
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:05,800
You're a good woman,
and you deserve me.

1375
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:08,400
You want out of that life.
I know you do.

1376
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:10,000
The only reason
you're going back to it...

1377
01:30:10,100 --> 01:30:12,600
is because you are still afraid.

1378
01:30:13,700 --> 01:30:15,600
I'm right here.

1379
01:30:17,100 --> 01:30:19,600
Helen, I love you.

1380
01:30:21,300 --> 01:30:23,400
But I need you to trust me.

1381
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:33,900
I'm sorry, Orlando.

1382
01:30:40,500 --> 01:30:41,900
Don't. Don't. Don't.

1383
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,600
What? What? Don't what?
Don't what? What? What?

1384
01:30:43,700 --> 01:30:45,600
What do you want from me?

1385
01:30:45,700 --> 01:30:47,800
What? Am I supposed to say,
"Let's be friends"?

1386
01:30:47,900 --> 01:30:50,400
-ls that what you want?
-Yes.

1387
01:30:50,500 --> 01:30:52,200
You don't get it, do you?

1388
01:30:52,200 --> 01:30:54,100
See, when you
really love someone...

1389
01:30:54,200 --> 01:30:56,100
you can't just be their friend.

1390
01:30:56,200 --> 01:30:57,900
I don't want to lose you.

1391
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,500
And I don't want
just half of you.

1392
01:31:08,100 --> 01:31:10,600
What's that on the dog's leg?

1393
01:31:10,600 --> 01:31:12,700
It's a flea and tick thing.

1394
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:13,800
A flea and...

1395
01:31:13,900 --> 01:31:15,000
Mm-hmm. Come on.

1396
01:31:15,100 --> 01:31:18,000
That don't look like
no flea and tick thing to me.

1397
01:31:18,100 --> 01:31:19,800
That looks very strange.
What is it?

1398
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:21,700
Madea, we're here!

1399
01:31:21,800 --> 01:31:24,700
Madea. Madea.

1400
01:31:24,700 --> 01:31:26,900
What's that on the dog's leg?

1401
01:31:26,900 --> 01:31:28,800
Lord, Myrtle Jean, look at you.

1402
01:31:28,900 --> 01:31:30,700
You're looking good, girl!

1403
01:31:30,700 --> 01:31:32,200
I just come from church.

1404
01:31:32,300 --> 01:31:33,600
Go ahead on, honey.
You look good.

1405
01:31:33,700 --> 01:31:34,900
When you coming to church?

1406
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,300
I'll be there as soon as
you get a smokers section.

1407
01:31:37,300 --> 01:31:39,000
I'm gonna be right there.

1408
01:31:39,100 --> 01:31:40,300
Yeah, you look good,
Myrtle Jean.

1409
01:31:40,300 --> 01:31:41,400
You look real good.

1410
01:31:41,500 --> 01:31:43,200
How are you doing, Joe?

1411
01:31:43,300 --> 01:31:45,300
I'm good. Come here, baby.
Come here.

1412
01:31:45,400 --> 01:31:47,000
Come here.

1413
01:31:47,100 --> 01:31:49,400
Come here.

1414
01:31:49,500 --> 01:31:52,100
I got Viagra.

1415
01:31:53,500 --> 01:31:55,300
Come here, baby.

1416
01:31:55,300 --> 01:31:57,600
I got Mace.

1417
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,500
You're just as mean as a snake,
Myrtle Jean.

1418
01:32:02,500 --> 01:32:04,400
You're mean as a snake.

1419
01:32:04,500 --> 01:32:06,200
Listen, next Sunday I'm cooking
a big old dinner...

1420
01:32:06,300 --> 01:32:08,000
and I want all of y'all
to come by here.

1421
01:32:08,100 --> 01:32:10,300
Helen,
have you called Orlando?

1422
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:11,900
That boy been calling here...

1423
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:13,700
and coming by here
like he's crazy.

1424
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:15,300
Who's Orlando?

1425
01:32:15,400 --> 01:32:17,100
Her boyfriend.

1426
01:32:17,200 --> 01:32:18,600
My friend.

1427
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:20,600
And yes, I did talk to him.

1428
01:32:20,700 --> 01:32:22,400
Baby, don't you
open that door...

1429
01:32:22,500 --> 01:32:24,700
before you've closed
the other one. You hear me?

1430
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:28,400
Myrtle Jean, can I get you
to open the door for me?

1431
01:32:28,500 --> 01:32:31,300
Knock, knock. Open wide.

1432
01:32:31,400 --> 01:32:34,300
Shut up, you old fool.
That all sounds real good...

1433
01:32:34,300 --> 01:32:36,300
sitting there telling your mom
he ain't nothing but a friend.

1434
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:38,700
But I don't know
if I believe that, honey.

1435
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:40,400
There's something
going on between y'all...

1436
01:32:40,500 --> 01:32:42,400
the way you've been
walking around here...

1437
01:32:42,500 --> 01:32:46,200
just smiling and grinning
all the time.

1438
01:32:46,300 --> 01:32:48,100
Mm-mm. I'm too busy
taking care of Charles.

1439
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:49,800
I don't have time for Orlando.

1440
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:51,800
You're better than me...

1441
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:54,000
because I would be beating
the hell out of Charles, honey.

1442
01:32:54,100 --> 01:32:56,300
Yeah, like that man
in "Misery."

1443
01:32:56,300 --> 01:32:58,500
That woman took that board...

1444
01:32:58,600 --> 01:33:00,400
and she put it
on his ankle bone...

1445
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:02,400
and she broke
both his foots off.

1446
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:05,000
They went just like this.
Both his foots went like this.

1447
01:33:05,100 --> 01:33:06,900
Broke both of them. That's
exactly what I'll be doing--

1448
01:33:06,900 --> 01:33:08,100
breaking something.

1449
01:33:08,100 --> 01:33:10,300
I'll tell you,
I learned a long time ago...

1450
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:13,800
that God could take care of
folks far better than you can.

1451
01:33:13,900 --> 01:33:15,400
God takes too long sometimes.

1452
01:33:15,500 --> 01:33:17,300
I need them
to get got right then.

1453
01:33:17,400 --> 01:33:19,400
That's why I don't worry
about folks.

1454
01:33:19,500 --> 01:33:22,900
They can't make me happy,
and they can't make me sad.

1455
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:24,200
What did the pastor say?

1456
01:33:24,300 --> 01:33:25,900
You know I don't know.

1457
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:27,400
I'd be trying to read
that Bible...

1458
01:33:27,500 --> 01:33:28,800
or go to church or something
and sit there...

1459
01:33:28,900 --> 01:33:32,000
and I looked down at that
New Testimony and saw Jesus--

1460
01:33:32,100 --> 01:33:33,800
you know,
the one with the words in red.

1461
01:33:33,900 --> 01:33:35,700
I look down and saw
all that red the other night.

1462
01:33:35,800 --> 01:33:37,600
I said, "l can't sit here
and read all of this."

1463
01:33:37,700 --> 01:33:39,500
Jesus was talking too much
for me to read all of that.

1464
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:41,200
Ain't that the truth?
It seems like every time...

1465
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:43,700
you open up the Bible,
you gets--

1466
01:33:43,800 --> 01:33:46,100
any time anybody
opens a Bible, I just fall--

1467
01:33:50,700 --> 01:33:51,800
I'm just playing.

1468
01:33:51,900 --> 01:33:54,100
You looking just like Beyonce.

1469
01:33:54,200 --> 01:33:56,300
Sexy thing.

1470
01:33:56,400 --> 01:33:59,400
Peace. Be still.
That's what he said.

1471
01:33:59,500 --> 01:34:01,000
Peace. Be still.

1472
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,400
You know what? Peace is
always still around me...

1473
01:34:03,400 --> 01:34:05,900
'cause I keeps me
what they call a piece of steel.

1474
01:34:05,900 --> 01:34:07,900
As long as you've got
a piece of steel...

1475
01:34:07,900 --> 01:34:09,400
you're gonna have peace.

1476
01:34:09,400 --> 01:34:11,600
Load your steel.
Thank you, Jesus.

1477
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:13,200
You're not reading
the right part.

1478
01:34:13,200 --> 01:34:16,000
Look here. That all sounds
real good and everything...

1479
01:34:16,100 --> 01:34:17,500
talking about
the "peace, be still"...

1480
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:19,000
and the Bible
and all that stuff.

1481
01:34:19,100 --> 01:34:20,600
But you got to be careful...

1482
01:34:20,700 --> 01:34:23,600
'cause I remember
this man did me wrong...

1483
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:25,600
honey, I didn't even know
how mad I was...

1484
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:27,400
till I got to his funeral.
He had died.

1485
01:34:27,500 --> 01:34:30,700
-Why were you so mad at him?
-Because he hit me.

1486
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:33,900
Yes, he did. He hit me.
And he is eight feet under.

1487
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:37,100
Six feet under. That's where
they bury folks--six feet.

1488
01:34:37,200 --> 01:34:38,400
That's what
I'm trying to tell you.

1489
01:34:38,500 --> 01:34:40,700
I thought I was over
what the man had done to me...

1490
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:42,600
till I saw him
laying in that casket.

1491
01:34:42,600 --> 01:34:44,600
The man was dead,
and I got mad all over again.

1492
01:34:44,600 --> 01:34:47,100
I beat him down two more feet.
I was mad as hell.

1493
01:34:47,100 --> 01:34:49,300
Listen, you think
you're over something...

1494
01:34:49,300 --> 01:34:51,500
you think you're ready
to get on with your life.

1495
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:54,400
This is how you really find out
if you're over something or not.

1496
01:34:54,500 --> 01:34:56,400
If you get an opportunity
to get even...

1497
01:34:56,500 --> 01:34:59,000
with somebody who did you wrong
and you don't take it...

1498
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:00,800
then you're over it,
but if you don't...

1499
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:02,700
and you beat the hell
out of them...

1500
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:04,300
you ain't over it yet.

1501
01:35:04,300 --> 01:35:07,600
Baby, tell me something.
How are y'all doing?

1502
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:09,000
I'll tell you how she's doing.

1503
01:35:09,100 --> 01:35:11,000
She's beating
the hell out of him.

1504
01:35:11,100 --> 01:35:12,400
How did you know?

1505
01:35:12,500 --> 01:35:14,400
Child, you've been around me.

1506
01:35:14,400 --> 01:35:17,200
I know something
done rubbed off on you.

1507
01:35:17,200 --> 01:35:19,100
You haven't hurt him, have you?

1508
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:22,700
Just his feelings.

1509
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:26,400
You know, I know this man
put a hurting on you, baby...

1510
01:35:26,500 --> 01:35:28,600
but you got to forgive him.

1511
01:35:28,700 --> 01:35:32,100
No matter what he done,
you got to forgive him--

1512
01:35:32,200 --> 01:35:34,900
not for him, but for you.

1513
01:35:34,900 --> 01:35:37,000
Forgive him for me?

1514
01:35:38,500 --> 01:35:41,100
When somebody hurts you...

1515
01:35:41,100 --> 01:35:43,400
they take power over you.

1516
01:35:43,500 --> 01:35:48,000
You don't forgive them,
they keeps the power.

1517
01:35:48,100 --> 01:35:50,000
Forgive him, baby.

1518
01:35:50,100 --> 01:35:53,900
And after you forgive him,
forgive yourself.

1519
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,800
Forgive me.

1520
01:35:56,900 --> 01:35:59,600
-For what?
-This.

1521
01:36:01,200 --> 01:36:04,300
Oh, lord have mercy. You know,
you just don't have no couth.

1522
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:05,800
That's what's wrong with you.

1523
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,200
John, $35,000 is not enough...

1524
01:36:08,300 --> 01:36:11,200
for me to take to my client.
I'm on the phone, sweetheart.

1525
01:36:11,300 --> 01:36:12,700
No. No way. You talk
to your client and--

1526
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:14,000
Stop! Stop the car!

1527
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:15,600
Stop! That's Mom!

1528
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:19,000
I'll call you back, John.

1529
01:36:19,100 --> 01:36:20,500
I'll call you back.

1530
01:36:20,600 --> 01:36:23,700
Can I go talk to her, Dad?
Please?

1531
01:36:23,800 --> 01:36:28,000
Dad! Can I go talk to her?

1532
01:36:28,100 --> 01:36:29,700
Go on.

1533
01:36:49,100 --> 01:36:51,400
Hey, Mama.

1534
01:36:51,500 --> 01:36:54,100
Tiffany. Hey, girl.

1535
01:36:56,800 --> 01:37:00,700
Mom...Dad let me sing
in the church choir.

1536
01:37:04,100 --> 01:37:06,000
That's good, baby.

1537
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:13,200
And I wish you would come.

1538
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:19,400
You know I ain't got
nothing to wear.

1539
01:37:23,400 --> 01:37:27,000
Well, the service
starts at 10:00...

1540
01:37:27,100 --> 01:37:29,000
if you want to come.

1541
01:37:29,100 --> 01:37:31,100
Tiffany.

1542
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:36,900
-Bye, Mama.
-Bye.

1543
01:37:55,100 --> 01:37:57,600
I can feel on my right side.

1544
01:38:00,100 --> 01:38:02,300
Are you going somewhere?

1545
01:38:02,400 --> 01:38:05,100
Actually, I was waiting on you.

1546
01:38:05,200 --> 01:38:06,700
What do you want?

1547
01:38:06,700 --> 01:38:09,500
I don't have anyone.

1548
01:38:11,100 --> 01:38:13,700
Everybody who I thought
was my friend...

1549
01:38:13,800 --> 01:38:16,300
has turned their back on me,
and it hurts.

1550
01:38:18,600 --> 01:38:22,600
But not nearly as much
as what I've done to you.

1551
01:38:24,500 --> 01:38:28,200
You are a good woman, Helen...

1552
01:38:28,300 --> 01:38:30,200
and a good person.

1553
01:38:30,300 --> 01:38:33,800
So...don't be like me.

1554
01:38:33,900 --> 01:38:37,000
You always used to tell me...

1555
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:40,000
"God has the power...

1556
01:38:40,100 --> 01:38:43,900
"to show you who's God."

1557
01:38:47,200 --> 01:38:48,600
I get it.

1558
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:54,300
Even though
I almost destroyed it...

1559
01:38:54,400 --> 01:38:57,000
I know you still have a heart.

1560
01:39:00,700 --> 01:39:03,000
For everything...

1561
01:39:05,100 --> 01:39:07,100
everything...

1562
01:39:07,200 --> 01:39:10,700
that I have ever
done wrong to you...

1563
01:39:13,700 --> 01:39:15,300
I'm sorry.

1564
01:39:19,900 --> 01:39:22,000
I...

1565
01:39:22,100 --> 01:39:24,900
am so...

1566
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,100
sorry.

1567
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,600
See, what I love about God...

1568
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:31,100
is that when he asks
a question...

1569
01:41:31,200 --> 01:41:32,700
he already knows the answer.

1570
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:36,800
He asked Ezekiel,
"Can these bones live?"

1571
01:41:36,900 --> 01:41:40,300
He asked the lame man,
"Will thy be made whole?"

1572
01:41:40,400 --> 01:41:42,300
Somebody's been made whole
up in here today.

1573
01:41:42,300 --> 01:41:43,900
Come on and give him
some praise.

1574
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:45,200
He asked Abraham...

1575
01:41:45,300 --> 01:41:47,400
"ls there anything
too hard for God?"

1576
01:41:47,500 --> 01:41:49,700
God is asking you
that question right now.

1577
01:41:49,700 --> 01:41:51,600
Is there anything
too hard for God?

1578
01:41:51,700 --> 01:41:54,700
Is there anything
too hard for him?

1579
01:41:54,800 --> 01:41:56,400
What will you
believe God for today?

1580
01:41:56,500 --> 01:41:58,400
God can deliver you
out of any addiction...

1581
01:41:58,500 --> 01:42:00,800
situation, or anything
that you dislike.

1582
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:02,400
Come on, somebody.

1583
01:42:02,400 --> 01:42:07,400
What will you believe God for?
Come on, choir.

1584
01:42:07,500 --> 01:42:09,700
The doors of the church
are open.

1585
01:42:11,500 --> 01:42:13,100
Come on.

1586
01:42:15,800 --> 01:42:17,500
Come on and bless his name.

1587
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:19,500
Hallelujah. Hallelujah.

1588
01:42:21,200 --> 01:42:25,100
Father, can you hear me?

1589
01:42:25,100 --> 01:42:28,600
We need your love today

1590
01:42:28,700 --> 01:42:32,100
I know that you are listening

1591
01:42:32,100 --> 01:42:37,100
You hear them every day

1592
01:42:37,100 --> 01:42:40,200
Father, please hear us

1593
01:42:40,300 --> 01:42:44,600
And we will be OK

1594
01:42:44,700 --> 01:42:47,200
Father, we need you

1595
01:42:48,700 --> 01:42:52,100
To live and lead us today

1596
01:42:52,200 --> 01:42:55,500
Father, can you hear me?

1597
01:42:55,500 --> 01:42:58,700
I'm calling on your name

1598
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:00,300
Yes.

1599
01:43:00,300 --> 01:43:02,600
Not Buddha nor Muhammad

1600
01:43:02,700 --> 01:43:06,700
But it's Jesus, we cry out loud

1601
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:11,200
Father, just forgive us

1602
01:43:11,300 --> 01:43:15,200
Hear us when we say

1603
01:43:15,300 --> 01:43:18,400
We'll give you, give you,
give you everything

1604
01:43:18,500 --> 01:43:23,100
Our lives and souls today

1605
01:43:23,100 --> 01:43:26,200
God, you know we need it

1606
01:43:26,300 --> 01:43:30,300
I've never seen so much pain

1607
01:43:30,400 --> 01:43:33,900
We have the faith for now

1608
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:38,100
Your victory we will gain

1609
01:43:38,100 --> 01:43:40,700
Father, you know we need it

1610
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:42,100
Hallelujah.

1611
01:43:42,100 --> 01:43:45,100
There's no more heart of stone

1612
01:43:45,200 --> 01:43:49,500
We're ready for your power

1613
01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:52,800
Now the sin is gone

1614
01:43:52,900 --> 01:43:56,800
Oh, father, can you hear me now?

1615
01:43:56,900 --> 01:43:58,700
Father

1616
01:43:58,700 --> 01:44:00,800
Can you hear me now?

1617
01:44:00,900 --> 01:44:02,400
Father

1618
01:44:02,400 --> 01:44:04,700
Can you hear me now?

1619
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:06,700
Father

1620
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:15,100
We will sing, sing a song

1621
01:44:15,200 --> 01:44:17,000
Sing a song

1622
01:44:17,100 --> 01:44:21,400
Just say you will, Jesus

1623
01:44:21,500 --> 01:44:22,800
Just say you will

1624
01:44:27,300 --> 01:44:30,600

Come on now

Many people are in need of love

1629
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:46,700
See them coming to you, Lord

1630
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:51,400
Just as I am, I'm in need
of the blood of the lamb

1631
01:44:51,500 --> 01:44:56,100
Oh, my soul, I say yeah

01:44:56,200 --> 01:44:58,400

Help me, Lord

1635
01:45:04,100 --> 01:45:07,500
I know I can't do this
by myself

1636
01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:14,200
I surrender, Lord

1637
01:45:14,300 --> 01:45:16,400

1638
01:45:16,500 --> 01:45:19,200

Father God, we thank you...

1654
01:46:16,100 --> 01:46:20,200
for this delicious meal
that we are about to partake in.

1655
01:46:20,300 --> 01:46:22,300
We ask that
you would bless us...

1656
01:46:22,400 --> 01:46:24,900
in the decisions that
we've made for you today.

1657
01:46:24,900 --> 01:46:27,700
Keep us strong as a unit,
Father.

1658
01:46:27,800 --> 01:46:29,400
We give you glory and honor
in the name of--

1659
01:46:29,500 --> 01:46:30,800
Amen, amen, amen.

-Amen.
-Amen. Amen.

1661
01:46:34,500 --> 01:46:37,300
Y'all ain't had greens
like this before, baby.

1662
01:46:37,400 --> 01:46:39,100
I put my foot in it.

1663
01:46:39,200 --> 01:46:41,100
Give me some cornbread.

1664
01:46:41,200 --> 01:46:43,000
Go ahead and eat something,
Myrtle Jean.

1665
01:46:43,100 --> 01:46:44,600
You know I'm hungry.

1666
01:46:44,700 --> 01:46:46,700
Charles?

1667
01:46:48,300 --> 01:46:51,900
You know I love you, right?

1668
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:53,500
Yeah.

1669
01:46:53,500 --> 01:46:57,100
And you know
I'll always be your friend.

1670
01:47:00,900 --> 01:47:03,600
Do you forgive me?

1671
01:47:07,800 --> 01:47:09,400
I already have.

1672
01:47:12,100 --> 01:47:15,500
Not just for what I did to you.

1673
01:47:49,100 --> 01:47:51,200
I'm in love.

1674
01:48:14,600 --> 01:48:17,000
Where are you going?

1675
01:48:19,600 --> 01:48:22,400
I'm going to find my man.

1676
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:25,100
Go get him, girl,
wherever he's at.

1677
01:48:25,200 --> 01:48:27,100
Yeah, aunt Helen.

1678
01:48:27,100 --> 01:48:29,500
Bye, y'all.

1679
01:48:29,600 --> 01:48:32,900
Lord have mercy.
I knowed it. I knowed it.

1680
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,500
Come on, Ike Turner.
Go on out there and get her.

1681
01:48:50,200 --> 01:48:53,300
Orlando! Orlando!

1682
01:48:53,400 --> 01:48:56,400
Ma'am! Whoa, ma'am!
You can't go in there!

1683
01:48:56,500 --> 01:48:58,700
That's not safe! Whoa!

1684
01:48:58,700 --> 01:49:01,000
Orlando!

1685
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:02,000
Orlando!

1686
01:49:02,100 --> 01:49:04,200
You have to stop.

1687
01:49:04,300 --> 01:49:07,700
Orlando! Orlando!

1688
01:49:07,700 --> 01:49:10,000
Ma'am, you've got to stop.

1689
01:49:10,100 --> 01:49:12,000
Orlando, where are you?

1690
01:49:12,100 --> 01:49:15,400
Sorry. You've got--
This is too dangerous.

1691
01:49:15,500 --> 01:49:18,400
It's not safe.
I've got to ask you to leave.

1692
01:49:18,400 --> 01:49:20,200
Boss, she's all right.
She's with me.

1693
01:49:22,600 --> 01:49:24,200
What are you doing here, Helen?

1694
01:49:24,300 --> 01:49:26,700
I gave it all up.

1695
01:49:26,800 --> 01:49:28,300
What?

1696
01:49:28,400 --> 01:49:30,400
I just want you.

1697
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:36,000
I just want you.

1698
01:49:38,900 --> 01:49:42,000
Ask me again.

1699
01:49:43,500 --> 01:49:46,400
Ask me again. I love you.

1700
01:49:46,500 --> 01:49:50,000
Now, how do you
know that, Helen?

1701
01:49:54,700 --> 01:49:58,600
I carry you in my spirit.

1702
01:50:00,500 --> 01:50:02,200
I pray for you...

1703
01:50:02,300 --> 01:50:05,200
more than I pray for myself.

1704
01:50:07,200 --> 01:50:11,100
And if you're away
for more than an hour...

1705
01:50:11,200 --> 01:50:15,000
I can't stop thinking about you.

1706
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:18,800
And your smile.

1707
01:50:18,900 --> 01:50:23,200
When you smile,
my world is all right.

1708
01:50:26,600 --> 01:50:29,800
Ask me again. I love you.

1709
01:50:29,900 --> 01:50:32,700
Ask me again.

1710
01:50:36,200 --> 01:50:38,700
Will you marry me?

1711
01:50:40,200 --> 01:50:42,100
Yes.

1712
01:50:42,100 --> 01:50:45,100
Yes. Yes.

1713
01:50:50,500 --> 01:50:51,900
Oh, Helen.

1714
01:50:53,500 --> 01:50:56,700
This woman right here
wants to marry me, y'all!

1715
01:50:56,800 --> 01:50:59,900
She wants to marry me!

1716
01:51:34,200 --> 01:51:36,500
Mary lost her faith

1717
01:51:36,600 --> 01:51:39,200
'Cause her brother had died

1718
01:51:39,300 --> 01:51:41,300
Jesus came forth

1719
01:51:41,400 --> 01:51:44,200
Saying, "Lazarus, be untied"

1720
01:51:44,200 --> 01:51:48,900
No matter how bad
you think it is

1721
01:51:48,900 --> 01:51:51,500
If you leave it at his feet

1722
01:51:51,600 --> 01:51:54,400
He'll give you pity, yeah

1723
01:51:54,400 --> 01:51:56,700
No matter what

1724
01:51:56,800 --> 01:51:59,000
You may be going through

1725
01:51:59,100 --> 01:52:01,400
Take it to the master

1726
01:52:01,400 --> 01:52:03,500
He'll see you right on through

1727
01:52:03,500 --> 01:52:06,100
I know Jesus

1728
01:52:06,200 --> 01:52:08,300
Take it to him

1729
01:52:08,400 --> 01:52:10,500
You can leave it there

1730
01:52:10,600 --> 01:52:13,400
He will work it out

1731
01:52:13,500 --> 01:52:15,500
No matter what

1732
01:52:15,600 --> 01:52:18,300
You might be going through

1733
01:52:18,400 --> 01:52:21,000
He will work it out

1734
01:52:21,100 --> 01:52:24,500
Pass it on, yeah

1735
01:52:24,500 --> 01:52:26,800
Don't let nobody

1736
01:52:26,900 --> 01:52:29,200
Turn you around

1737
01:52:29,300 --> 01:52:31,300
Give it to Jesus

1738
01:52:31,400 --> 01:52:33,700
He'll never let you down

1739
01:52:33,800 --> 01:52:36,200
Take it to Jesus

1740
01:52:36,200 --> 01:52:38,300
Take it to Jesus

1741
01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:40,300
Take, take, take it to Jesus

1742
01:52:40,400 --> 01:52:43,000
Take, take, take, take, take

1743
01:52:43,100 --> 01:52:46,500
Take, take, take it to Jesus

1744
01:52:46,500 --> 01:52:48,900
He will be right there

1745
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,000
All your problems

1746
01:52:51,100 --> 01:52:53,200
Every situation

1747
01:52:53,300 --> 01:52:56,400
He will work it out, yeah

1748
01:53:20,100 --> 01:53:23,900
I'll tell you. There ain't
nothing on TV no more.

1749
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:27,000
Redd Foxx died, and all
the good TV went to hell.

1750
01:53:27,100 --> 01:53:29,200
Yes.

1751
01:53:29,200 --> 01:53:33,700
Donna Richardson on there
"Sweating in the Spirit."

1752
01:53:33,700 --> 01:53:35,500
Hold it here.

1753
01:53:35,600 --> 01:53:37,800
Yes, Lord. Thank you
for Donna Richardson, Lord.

1754
01:53:37,900 --> 01:53:40,800
Thank you for
Donna Richardson, Lord.

1755
01:53:40,900 --> 01:53:42,800
...with the arms
swooping up and over.

1756
01:53:42,900 --> 01:53:44,500
Reach over. Here we go.

1757
01:53:44,600 --> 01:53:47,000
Now, keep your feet planted.
Separate them wider.

1758
01:53:47,100 --> 01:53:48,700
And separate. Pick it up.

1759
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:51,800
Do it. Down. Down.

1760
01:53:51,900 --> 01:53:53,900
Ooh, she did it!

1761
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,700
Aw, hell, Donna.

1762
01:53:56,800 --> 01:53:59,000
You don't do that to me, baby.

1763
01:53:59,100 --> 01:54:00,200
Oxygen. Oxygen.

1764
01:54:00,300 --> 01:54:02,100
This time,
when we come back up...

1765
01:54:02,200 --> 01:54:04,800
lift the arms above the head.

1766
01:54:04,800 --> 01:54:06,800
Lift it up, two, three.

1767
01:54:06,900 --> 01:54:09,000
Now, I really want you
to still concentrate...

1768
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:10,700
on what the legs are doing.

1769
01:54:10,700 --> 01:54:12,900
Continue your breathing.

1770
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:14,200
That's it. Come on.

1771
01:54:14,300 --> 01:54:15,800
When your muscles are working...

1772
01:54:15,900 --> 01:54:17,500
you've got to breathe it out.

1773
01:54:17,500 --> 01:54:19,800
And lower back down.
One more. Lift it up.

1774
01:54:19,900 --> 01:54:22,000
You're trying
to kill me, Donna.

1775
01:54:22,100 --> 01:54:24,000
Trying to kill me.

1776
01:54:24,100 --> 01:54:25,200
And action.

1777
01:54:25,300 --> 01:54:27,600
Harpo, who this woman?

1778
01:54:27,700 --> 01:54:29,000
Harpo, I say, who this woman?

1779
01:54:29,100 --> 01:54:31,500
Joe, leave that child alone.

1780
01:54:31,500 --> 01:54:33,300
Where's your medicine?

1781
01:54:33,400 --> 01:54:35,200
They're at home. Where's yours?

1782
01:54:39,900 --> 01:54:41,300
I'm sorry.

1783
01:54:41,300 --> 01:54:42,400
That's all right.

1784
01:54:42,500 --> 01:54:44,400
Harpo, who this woman?

1785
01:54:44,400 --> 01:54:47,000
Wait a minute.
I need somebody else...

1786
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,300
to read that.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1787
01:54:49,400 --> 01:54:50,600
Harpo, who this woman?

1788
01:54:50,600 --> 01:54:52,200
I say, Harpo, who this woman?

1789
01:54:52,300 --> 01:54:53,800
Joe, leave that child alone.

1790
01:54:53,900 --> 01:54:55,300
You take your medicine?

1791
01:54:55,400 --> 01:54:57,500
They're at home. Where's yours?

1792
01:55:07,700 --> 01:55:11,000
That won't cut.

1793
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:12,800
-You want some?
-No.

1794
01:55:12,900 --> 01:55:14,600
You sure?

1795
01:55:14,600 --> 01:55:16,000
I'm positive.

1796
01:55:16,100 --> 01:55:17,100
Come on, John.

1797
01:55:17,200 --> 01:55:18,500
Just have a little bit of it.

1798
01:55:18,500 --> 01:55:19,600
Not me.

1799
01:55:19,600 --> 01:55:22,100
Not you?
John, you want some?

1800
01:55:22,100 --> 01:55:23,200
No.

1801
01:55:23,200 --> 01:55:24,600
All right.

1802
01:55:24,600 --> 01:55:26,100
I love you, Daddy.

1803
01:55:28,200 --> 01:55:29,800
OK. All right.

1804
01:55:29,900 --> 01:55:31,500
I love you, Dad--

1805
01:55:33,200 --> 01:55:35,100
Come on, man.

1806
01:55:37,200 --> 01:55:39,000
All right. Come on.

1807
01:55:41,900 --> 01:55:44,100
Man, we're gonna be here
all night with you.

1808
01:55:44,200 --> 01:55:45,800
Come on. One more time.

1809
01:55:45,800 --> 01:55:47,300
I got a funny bone.

1810
01:55:47,300 --> 01:55:48,700
You got a funny bone?
OK. All right.

1811
01:55:48,800 --> 01:55:51,700
You might want to cut there,
because I don't--

1812
01:55:53,700 --> 01:55:55,900
I done rubbed off
on her too much.

1813
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,300
She's gonna need to mail it.

1814
01:55:58,300 --> 01:56:02,600
You ain't supposed
to leave a man at the table.

1815
01:56:02,700 --> 01:56:06,100
At least wait
till you get in the car to--

1816
01:56:06,100 --> 01:56:08,100
She embarrassed
the hell out of you...

1817
01:56:08,100 --> 01:56:10,700
in front of the whole family.

1818
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:14,400
That got to hurt.
You ought to feel this big.

1819
01:56:14,500 --> 01:56:16,700
Matter of fact,
she told me you were--

1820
01:56:16,800 --> 01:56:20,200
I'm just--
