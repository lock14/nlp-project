1
00:00:34,934 --> 00:00:37,034
Music's weird.

2
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,534
It calms me down.

3
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,734
You're smoking meth,

4
00:00:42,801 --> 00:00:45,734
and you want to calm down?

5
00:00:47,534 --> 00:00:49,467
I'll be right back.

6
00:00:49,534 --> 00:00:51,534
Got to go do something.

7
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:07,834
Yes?

8
00:01:29,634 --> 00:01:31,600
<i>Drive! Drive!</i>

9
00:01:36,667 --> 00:01:37,934
Look out, look out, look out!

10
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:41,433
Crap! My mom's
gonna kill me.

11
00:01:44,761 --> 00:01:48,704
Dude, what did you just do?

12
00:01:48,765 --> 00:01:49,962
I took a leak.

13
00:01:53,005 --> 00:01:55,762
Oh, sweet!

14
00:02:01,467 --> 00:02:04,801

on a trip ♪

15
00:02:06,801 --> 00:02:08,867

16
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,500
Honey?

17
00:02:37,767 --> 00:02:40,534
Hey, hon?

18
00:02:44,834 --> 00:02:46,734
ANNABETH:
Who discovered the bodies?

19
00:02:46,801 --> 00:02:48,567
DRUMMER:
James Prichard.
Came home

20
00:02:48,634 --> 00:02:50,367
from a business trip
to find his wife

21
00:02:50,433 --> 00:02:54,201
and mother-in-law shot dead,
point-blank range.

22
00:02:54,268 --> 00:02:57,734
Ballistics matched .380 caliber,
probably a pistol.

23
00:02:57,801 --> 00:02:59,534
STEVE:
Cheap, concealable, quiet.

24
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,600
Yeah. They were killed
in the living room.

25
00:03:01,667 --> 00:03:03,067
TV was still on.

26
00:03:03,134 --> 00:03:05,867
What are you thinking--
home invasion, robbery, drugs?

27
00:03:05,934 --> 00:03:07,201
DRUMMER:
Well, they're
all on the menu,

28
00:03:07,268 --> 00:03:09,001
but never can tell.

29
00:03:09,067 --> 00:03:10,101
Leads on the shooter?

30
00:03:10,168 --> 00:03:12,168
Uh, there's
one unidentified

31
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:14,101
fingerprint on the wife's
wedding ring

32
00:03:14,168 --> 00:03:16,367
and a few others
we're still working on.

33
00:03:16,433 --> 00:03:17,801
And the husband was where
when this happened?

34
00:03:17,867 --> 00:03:18,734
Away on business, Chicago.

35
00:03:18,801 --> 00:03:19,734
How long?

36
00:03:19,801 --> 00:03:20,901
Just one night.

37
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:22,433
He's in financial services.

38
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,067
Any chance
the husband might have...

39
00:03:24,134 --> 00:03:25,834
Hired somebody to kill his wife
and mother-in-law

40
00:03:25,901 --> 00:03:27,034
while he was
conveniently

41
00:03:27,101 --> 00:03:27,934
out of town

42
00:03:28,001 --> 00:03:29,168
with an iron-clad alibi?

43
00:03:29,234 --> 00:03:31,034
I was gonna ask
if you had any thoughts

44
00:03:31,101 --> 00:03:32,300
on who the shooter might be.

45
00:03:32,367 --> 00:03:34,600
No. This guy is in shock.

46
00:03:34,667 --> 00:03:37,801
Um, let's see. Mr. Prichard
checked out of his hotel

47
00:03:37,867 --> 00:03:40,234
11:15 a.m.
on Wednesday.

48
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,700
Flew back to Indianapolis
that afternoon.

49
00:03:42,767 --> 00:03:44,901
M.E. thinks
the shootings went down

50
00:03:44,967 --> 00:03:46,400
Tuesday night.

51
00:03:46,467 --> 00:03:48,300
MAUREEN:
What a horror show, coming home

52
00:03:48,367 --> 00:03:50,700
and finding your family killed
for no reason.

53
00:03:50,767 --> 00:03:52,101
Do me a favor.

54
00:03:52,168 --> 00:03:53,433
Let's keep the press
at bay on this.

55
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,767
We don't need a media circus

56
00:03:55,834 --> 00:03:57,867
until we have somebody
in custody.

57
00:03:58,967 --> 00:04:00,367
And Annabeth?

58
00:04:01,801 --> 00:04:03,600
Get ready to catch this one
when it lands.

59
00:04:10,734 --> 00:04:13,001
WOMAN:
I remember hearing a car racing
down the street,

60
00:04:13,067 --> 00:04:16,534
<i>but I had no idea
it hit my car.</i>

61
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,967
Anyway, before bed,
I let the pupper out,

62
00:04:20,034 --> 00:04:22,934
and that's when I
noticed this mess.

63
00:04:23,001 --> 00:04:25,234
What's strange, I
didn't hear the shots,

64
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,034
but I heard a car.

65
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:28,367
Yeah, well,
shots were fired indoors.

66
00:04:28,433 --> 00:04:29,967
It came
from a small caliber weapon.

67
00:04:30,034 --> 00:04:31,534
It's quieter than you think.

68
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,600
When did you hear the vehicle
racing down the street?

69
00:04:34,667 --> 00:04:36,567
I was watching one of my shows.

70
00:04:36,634 --> 00:04:39,567
Maybe 8:00, 9:00 p.m.

71
00:04:39,634 --> 00:04:41,700
So, how well were you acquainted
with the Prichards?

72
00:04:41,767 --> 00:04:43,801
MAN:
She was a very
kind lady.

73
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:46,067
It's just so terrible.

74
00:04:46,134 --> 00:04:48,534
It really just makes you scared.

75
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,567
You think things like this
won't happen

76
00:04:50,634 --> 00:04:52,034
in your own backyard.

77
00:04:52,101 --> 00:04:54,300
Well, did you hear anything,
see anything?

78
00:04:56,134 --> 00:04:58,234
When I got up in the morning,

79
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,534
I noticed
all their lights were still on.

80
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,834
I-I thought it was odd,
but I thought

81
00:05:02,901 --> 00:05:05,001
they just forgot.

82
00:05:08,134 --> 00:05:10,001
<i>WOMAN:
This mirror is
from the right side</i>

83
00:05:10,067 --> 00:05:12,168
<i>of a 1995 Chevy Tahoe.</i>

84
00:05:12,234 --> 00:05:13,901
And from the
paint scrapings,

85
00:05:13,967 --> 00:05:16,901
this particular SUV
is dark blue metallic.

86
00:05:16,967 --> 00:05:18,534
Thanks.

87
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,700
Check body shops,
uh, local insurance agents.

88
00:05:21,767 --> 00:05:25,433
We're looking for a 1995
dark blue Chevy Tahoe,

89
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,300
a scrape on the right side,

90
00:05:27,367 --> 00:05:29,201
missing the passenger-side
mirror.

91
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:37,934
<i>WOMAN:
I'm so surprised the police
are investigating this.</i>

92
00:05:38,001 --> 00:05:39,967
We just called our insurance guy
yesterday.

93
00:05:40,034 --> 00:05:41,500
Can you tell me what happened?

94
00:05:41,567 --> 00:05:43,534
My son Charles went
to marching band practice,

95
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,034
and somebody banged it up
in the high school parking lot.

96
00:05:46,101 --> 00:05:47,967
May  I speak with Charles?

97
00:05:48,034 --> 00:05:49,901
Sure. Come on in.

98
00:05:53,168 --> 00:05:55,767
Lately, he's been practicing
a couple of hours a day.

99
00:05:58,767 --> 00:05:59,867
Chuckie?

100
00:06:04,268 --> 00:06:05,967
Chuckie, what on earth
are you doing?

101
00:06:06,034 --> 00:06:07,001
What...?

102
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:10,201
Chuckie, get back
in here!

103
00:06:11,433 --> 00:06:13,534
Chuckie!

104
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,700
Get off of me.

105
00:06:14,767 --> 00:06:16,500
This is Detective Drummer.

106
00:06:16,567 --> 00:06:21,700
I need a black and white sent
to 338 Rosewood Avenue.

107
00:06:21,767 --> 00:06:24,500
I'm very sorry
for what happened Tuesday night.

108
00:06:24,567 --> 00:06:27,967
I didn't know anything
about the murder beforehand.

109
00:06:28,034 --> 00:06:30,700
I thought we were just out
smoking meth.

110
00:06:30,767 --> 00:06:32,168
We? Who's we?

111
00:06:32,234 --> 00:06:34,734
Chuckie wants
to fully cooperate.

112
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,034
He feels genuine remorse.

113
00:06:39,101 --> 00:06:41,168
He's confessed
to being there.

114
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,201
He  admits to doing drugs,

115
00:06:43,268 --> 00:06:45,201
and he's perfectly willing

116
00:06:45,268 --> 00:06:47,300
to tell you the name
of the other guy.

117
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,567
The guy with the gun.

118
00:06:49,634 --> 00:06:51,767
I'm waiting.

119
00:06:51,834 --> 00:06:53,433
We're looking for probation.

120
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:58,867
Right now,
you're our prime suspect.

121
00:06:58,934 --> 00:07:01,201
You've admitted to
fleeing the scene of
a double homicide.

122
00:07:01,268 --> 00:07:02,901
You're old enough
to be tried as an adult.

123
00:07:02,967 --> 00:07:04,268
But I didn't kill anybody.

124
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:06,433
I didn't even go in the house.

125
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,067
You have any idea why
your friend shot two women

126
00:07:08,134 --> 00:07:09,067
in cold blood?

127
00:07:09,134 --> 00:07:10,700
He's not my friend.

128
00:07:10,767 --> 00:07:12,067
Then what was he doing
in your car?

129
00:07:16,134 --> 00:07:18,867
He was my dealer.

130
00:07:18,934 --> 00:07:21,134
We were driving around

131
00:07:21,201 --> 00:07:22,367
getting high.

132
00:07:22,433 --> 00:07:24,567
He-He just told me to pull over.

133
00:07:24,634 --> 00:07:26,433
I stayed in the car
the whole time.

134
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,867
I had no idea
what was gonna happen.

135
00:07:28,934 --> 00:07:30,500
Then I heard the shots,

136
00:07:30,567 --> 00:07:33,801
and I drove him away,
but that's-that's all I did.

137
00:07:33,867 --> 00:07:35,500
You drove a getaway car
in a murder.

138
00:07:35,567 --> 00:07:37,500
That makes you just as culpable
as the person

139
00:07:37,567 --> 00:07:39,467
who allegedly committed
the crime.

140
00:07:39,534 --> 00:07:41,400
If he knew a crime was being
committed, which he did not.

141
00:07:41,467 --> 00:07:42,801
ANNABETH:
He just told
me he heard the shots.

142
00:07:42,867 --> 00:07:44,967
At the very least that's aiding
and abetting.

143
00:07:45,034 --> 00:07:46,500
MAN:
Listen, this
is all about

144
00:07:46,561 --> 00:07:48,504
who the other guy is,
and you're not gonna get to him

145
00:07:48,565 --> 00:07:50,002
without making a deal.

146
00:07:50,065 --> 00:07:51,402
WOMAN:
My son has a
drug problem,

147
00:07:51,467 --> 00:07:52,801
but he didn't

148
00:07:52,867 --> 00:07:56,333
rob  anybody,
and he certainly isn't a killer.

149
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,600
He goes to church.

150
00:07:58,667 --> 00:08:00,567
He plays in the marching band.

151
00:08:00,634 --> 00:08:03,101
We're not the kind of people
who do things like this.

152
00:08:03,168 --> 00:08:05,734
He's a scared kid
who made a mistake.

153
00:08:05,801 --> 00:08:07,168
He fled the scene.

154
00:08:07,234 --> 00:08:09,134
He drove the getaway car.

155
00:08:09,201 --> 00:08:10,634
He's doing time.

156
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,067
MAN:
How much time?

157
00:08:12,134 --> 00:08:13,600
ANNABETH:
One year in prison,
five years

158
00:08:13,667 --> 00:08:15,867
felony probation,
mandatory drug rehab.

159
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,400
I want a guarantee.

160
00:08:18,467 --> 00:08:20,634
Two women are dead.

161
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,268
So I'll tell you what.

162
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:24,901
If he's lying,

163
00:08:24,967 --> 00:08:26,767
if he doesn't lead us
to the killer,

164
00:08:26,834 --> 00:08:28,967
if his testimony
falls apart,

165
00:08:29,034 --> 00:08:32,134
he's doing 12 years, guaranteed.

166
00:08:50,934 --> 00:08:52,867
Does TJ deal meth out
of the apartment?

167
00:08:52,934 --> 00:08:55,034
I don't know.

168
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:57,667
I always just
called him up.

169
00:08:57,734 --> 00:08:59,067
There he is.

170
00:08:59,134 --> 00:09:01,901
That's him.
That's TJ, the guy.

171
00:09:06,101 --> 00:09:07,901
DRUMMER:
TJ?

172
00:09:07,967 --> 00:09:08,867
Yeah?

173
00:09:08,934 --> 00:09:10,567
Detective Drummer.

174
00:09:12,067 --> 00:09:12,801
WOMAN:
TJ!

175
00:09:12,867 --> 00:09:14,001
Is he armed?

176
00:09:14,067 --> 00:09:15,168
What do you...
what do you mean?

177
00:09:15,234 --> 00:09:16,700
Does he have a gun?

178
00:09:16,767 --> 00:09:18,067
He used to. I don't...
I don't know.

179
00:09:18,134 --> 00:09:19,268
Stay there.

180
00:09:39,634 --> 00:09:41,201
<i>ANNABETH:
Chuckie led us to the shooter</i>

181
00:09:41,268 --> 00:09:42,667
<i>who had stolen goods
in his possession</i>

182
00:09:42,734 --> 00:09:44,268
<i>which he'd taken from the home</i>

183
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:47,134
of Julie Prichard, one
of the two women he murdered.

184
00:09:47,201 --> 00:09:48,367
So, this Chuckie
will testify

185
00:09:48,433 --> 00:09:50,101
that he saw TJ go
into the house,

186
00:09:50,168 --> 00:09:51,634
that he heard shots
fired, and that

187
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,201
TJ ran from the house
with stolen property?

188
00:09:53,268 --> 00:09:54,433
Exactly.

189
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,234
Chuckie's passed
a lie detector test.

190
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,467
I think he's for real.

191
00:09:57,534 --> 00:09:59,034
He's-He's a 16-year-old kid.

192
00:09:59,101 --> 00:10:00,567
He got in over his head.

193
00:10:00,634 --> 00:10:02,201
And TJ?

194
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,268
TJ's 20.

195
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:04,901
Is there any
other evidence

196
00:10:04,967 --> 00:10:06,801
to tie this TJ
character directly
to the crime scene?

197
00:10:06,867 --> 00:10:08,700
DRUMMER:
The prints we found
in the house and the

198
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:11,700
partial print we found
on Julie's wedding band

199
00:10:11,767 --> 00:10:13,234
turned out to be TJ's.

200
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,734
Apparently, he tried
to pry it off her finger

201
00:10:15,801 --> 00:10:17,333
after killing her.

202
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,101
ANNABETH:
That's as cold-blooded
as it gets.

203
00:10:20,168 --> 00:10:21,567
Junkies will take anything.

204
00:10:21,634 --> 00:10:22,734
STEVE:
Okay, so,

205
00:10:22,801 --> 00:10:24,001
walk us through Chuckie's deal.

206
00:10:24,067 --> 00:10:25,300
ANNABETH:
His lawyer wanted him

207
00:10:25,367 --> 00:10:27,168
to walk, but I got one year
in jail,

208
00:10:27,234 --> 00:10:29,300
and five years felony probation.

209
00:10:29,367 --> 00:10:30,467
Sounds about right.

210
00:10:30,534 --> 00:10:31,734
Any lead
on the murder weapon, Lou?

211
00:10:31,801 --> 00:10:33,034
DRUMMER:
We're searching
for it now.

212
00:10:33,101 --> 00:10:35,700
Chuckie claims
that TJ threw the gun out

213
00:10:35,767 --> 00:10:37,333
of the car window the night
of the murders.

214
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,467
And Chuckie's gonna lead us
to where it got tossed.

215
00:10:39,534 --> 00:10:41,168
He threw the murder
weapon out the window?

216
00:10:41,234 --> 00:10:42,567
MAUREEN:
Guy's a
meth addict.

217
00:10:42,634 --> 00:10:44,400
He's not the sharpest knife
in the drawer.

218
00:10:44,467 --> 00:10:48,101
Okay. So, it looks like
Mr. Terrence Jerome Mills

219
00:10:48,168 --> 00:10:50,567
is on the hook for two counts
of murder and armed robbery.

220
00:10:50,634 --> 00:10:52,101
Let's schedule an arraignment,

221
00:10:52,168 --> 00:10:54,300
and find TJ's
murder weapon.

222
00:10:54,367 --> 00:10:56,967
Maureen, I want
you to talk to TJ's
public defender.

223
00:10:57,034 --> 00:10:59,400
Let's see if the boy
wonder has anything
to say for himself.

224
00:10:59,467 --> 00:11:01,500
And Annabeth, I want you
to get a deposition

225
00:11:01,567 --> 00:11:02,834
from the victim's husband.

226
00:11:02,901 --> 00:11:04,333
There's no evidence
that he was involved here,

227
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,001
but let me know if you feel

228
00:11:06,067 --> 00:11:07,700
like there's something
important we're missing here.

229
00:11:30,734 --> 00:11:33,101
<i>MAUREEN:
Chuckie said
you pulled the trigger.</i>

230
00:11:33,168 --> 00:11:35,001
You don't have to
respond to that.

231
00:11:35,067 --> 00:11:36,333
I can respond to it.

232
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,867
Chuckie's lying, okay?

233
00:11:37,934 --> 00:11:40,001
He killed those ladies,
not me.

234
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:41,834
We were driving around
getting high, you know,

235
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:43,168
and Chuckie said,

236
00:11:43,234 --> 00:11:44,333
"Let's get some money.

237
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,333
Let's do these people."

238
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,201
Then he just shot them both.

239
00:11:48,268 --> 00:11:49,700
Boom,

240
00:11:49,767 --> 00:11:51,333
boom.

241
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,634
It was sickening.

242
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,834
Any reason?

243
00:11:54,901 --> 00:11:56,333
Just for the fun of it?

244
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,433
Yeah.

245
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,934
Chuckie's a jackass.

246
00:11:59,001 --> 00:12:02,234
TJ, his fingerprints
aren't all over that house,

247
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,467
but yours are.

248
00:12:03,534 --> 00:12:04,734
Yeah,  because
he was wearing gloves.

249
00:12:04,801 --> 00:12:06,134
Uh-huh.

250
00:12:06,201 --> 00:12:07,867
The police found
the murder weapon,

251
00:12:07,934 --> 00:12:09,300
a .380-caliber pistol.

252
00:12:09,367 --> 00:12:11,234
It's  a straight-up
ballistics match

253
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,467
from the killings.

254
00:12:12,534 --> 00:12:14,234
That's not my gun.
Really?

255
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,433
Then why are your fingerprints
all over it?

256
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,467
You don't have to answer that.

257
00:12:18,534 --> 00:12:20,467
I'm not gonna.

258
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:26,134
Our office is willing to take
the death penalty off the table

259
00:12:26,201 --> 00:12:27,867
if you will plead guilty.

260
00:12:27,934 --> 00:12:28,934
Let's get real, Maureen.

261
00:12:29,001 --> 00:12:30,268
You know the
death penalty

262
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,901
isn't on the table
in the first place.

263
00:12:31,967 --> 00:12:34,067
There are no special
circumstances.

264
00:12:34,134 --> 00:12:35,901
The case
is completely circumstantial,

265
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:37,801
and your star witness
is a drug addict.

266
00:12:37,867 --> 00:12:40,734
The worst possible
case scenario,

267
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:42,433
TJ gets life without parole.

268
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,333
Yeah, well, that's more than
he gave those two women.

269
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,967
We're offering nothing less.

270
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:50,168
Since that's what he's
going to get from a jury,

271
00:12:50,234 --> 00:12:51,600
if he gets convicted,

272
00:12:51,667 --> 00:12:54,134
might as well roll the dice
and see if he gets off.

273
00:12:54,201 --> 00:12:57,734
Yeah, well, let me know
how that works out for you.

274
00:13:04,834 --> 00:13:06,600
Oh, Mr. Prichard.

275
00:13:06,667 --> 00:13:09,467
I'm Deputy Prosecuting
Attorney Chase.

276
00:13:09,534 --> 00:13:11,467
I'm, uh, I'm so
sorry for your loss.

277
00:13:11,534 --> 00:13:12,801
Thank you.

278
00:13:12,867 --> 00:13:14,967
Please, have a seat.

279
00:13:15,034 --> 00:13:16,801
I know this is
a difficult time,

280
00:13:16,867 --> 00:13:20,101
but I do have some
progress to report.

281
00:13:20,168 --> 00:13:21,634
It looks like we
may have found

282
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,134
the man who murdered your
wife and mother-in-law.

283
00:13:24,201 --> 00:13:26,333
Who is it?

284
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,134
Does this man look
familiar to you?

285
00:13:31,834 --> 00:13:33,934
No.
Take your time.

286
00:13:34,001 --> 00:13:35,901
Maybe your wife knew him?

287
00:13:35,967 --> 00:13:38,801
No. I'm sorry.

288
00:13:38,867 --> 00:13:41,667
What about the other kid,
the, uh, driver?

289
00:13:41,734 --> 00:13:43,134
Chuckie.

290
00:13:43,201 --> 00:13:46,001
He led us to the shooter
and is testifying against him

291
00:13:46,067 --> 00:13:48,467
in exchange
for a reduced sentence.

292
00:13:48,534 --> 00:13:49,767
How reduced?

293
00:13:49,834 --> 00:13:52,534
One year in jail,
five years probation.

294
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,201
That's all he gets,
for killing my wife?

295
00:13:55,268 --> 00:13:56,500
We believe he only drove the car

296
00:13:56,567 --> 00:13:57,934
and had no prior knowledge
of the murder.

297
00:13:58,001 --> 00:13:59,767
And that he could
not have stopped it.

298
00:13:59,834 --> 00:14:01,268
He didn't even try
to report it.

299
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:03,634
Maybe if he had called 911.

300
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:06,268
We need Chuckie's testimony
to put your wife's killer away.

301
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:08,134
Otherwise we never
would have made the deal.

302
00:14:08,201 --> 00:14:10,834
Promise me this is the guy.

303
00:14:10,901 --> 00:14:14,234
Promise me he's not going
to get off easy, too.

304
00:14:15,268 --> 00:14:17,467
I promise.

305
00:14:17,534 --> 00:14:20,333
If he's the guy,
he won't get off easy.

306
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,734
He'll be charged
with both murders.

307
00:14:23,801 --> 00:14:25,001
I'm just curious.

308
00:14:25,067 --> 00:14:28,700
Does your work take you
out of town often?

309
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:30,467
No.

310
00:14:30,534 --> 00:14:33,634
But this was the Midwest
Mortgage Lenders Association's

311
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,300
annual conference.

312
00:14:35,367 --> 00:14:37,500
It happens once a year.

313
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:40,134
I used to like to go
on the thing, you know,

314
00:14:40,201 --> 00:14:41,967
hanging out with the guys.

315
00:14:42,034 --> 00:14:46,967
But ever since I married Julie,
I can't wait to get home.

316
00:14:47,034 --> 00:14:50,001
I just get so lonely
without her.

317
00:14:50,067 --> 00:14:52,767
She doesn't like
to be alone, either.

318
00:14:52,834 --> 00:14:57,101
That's why her mom
was with her at the house.

319
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,867
We kept talking
about getting a dog,

320
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:03,934
but I figured I'd be the one

321
00:15:04,001 --> 00:15:07,433
stuck walking the damn thing
every day.

322
00:15:09,134 --> 00:15:12,001
Damn it.

323
00:15:13,834 --> 00:15:18,268
I just keep thinking, if I'd
only been there, you know?

324
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:20,433
If I'd...

325
00:15:23,901 --> 00:15:26,467
ANNABETH:
Who asked for this meeting,
us or them?

326
00:15:26,534 --> 00:15:28,634
His PD,
a career-climber.

327
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,667
I think she staging
a dog-and-pony act

328
00:15:30,734 --> 00:15:32,134
to impress her supervisor.

329
00:15:32,201 --> 00:15:33,600
She knows TJ's guilty as sin,

330
00:15:33,667 --> 00:15:35,134
but she's got to act
like she's fighting for him.

331
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:37,467
I'm thinking
she'll ask for 30 years.

332
00:15:37,534 --> 00:15:40,634
And we'll counter with two
terms of 60 consecutive?

333
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,268
Exactly.
Hmm.

334
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,467
Oh, man, oh, man, oh, man.

335
00:15:46,534 --> 00:15:48,467
Oh, man, all right,
tell them. Tell them.

336
00:15:48,534 --> 00:15:49,801
Sit down, TJ.

337
00:15:49,867 --> 00:15:51,268
You brought
us down here

338
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:53,101
to watch your client
go through withdrawal?

339
00:15:53,168 --> 00:15:54,934
I come bearing gifts.

340
00:15:55,001 --> 00:15:56,134
Just get to it, Becky.

341
00:15:56,201 --> 00:15:57,567
Hypothetically,
if TJ were to confess

342
00:15:57,634 --> 00:15:58,867
to killing Julie Prichard

343
00:15:58,934 --> 00:16:00,168
and her mother
on the night of December 6,

344
00:16:00,234 --> 00:16:01,967
and if he were to tell you
that someone hired him

345
00:16:02,034 --> 00:16:04,268
to commit these murders...
You're claiming this

346
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:05,433
was an execution?

347
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,034
This was not
a random home invasion.

348
00:16:07,101 --> 00:16:08,333
This was a murder for hire.

349
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,134
And you can prove that by...?

350
00:16:10,201 --> 00:16:11,600
In exchange
for giving you the man

351
00:16:11,667 --> 00:16:13,967
who ordered these executions,
TJ will serve 15 years.

352
00:16:14,034 --> 00:16:15,467
Or  we'll investigate
and find him ourselves.

353
00:16:15,534 --> 00:16:17,901
You'll never get
near him without me.

354
00:16:17,967 --> 00:16:20,101
He's one of the biggest
amphetamine suppliers
in the Midwest.

355
00:16:20,168 --> 00:16:21,433
If you could get him,

356
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,168
you would have done so
a long time ago.

357
00:16:23,234 --> 00:16:25,268
You murdered two women in
the course of an armed robbery.

358
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:26,567
We're not interested in a deal

359
00:16:26,634 --> 00:16:28,300
unless you're giving up
Osama bin Laden.

360
00:16:28,367 --> 00:16:30,034
Well, then,
we're in luck.

361
00:16:30,101 --> 00:16:31,801
How does Richard Wolf sound?

362
00:16:33,567 --> 00:16:37,534
Richard Wolf hired you
to murder these women?

363
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,801
I'm a dealer.
He's my supplier.

364
00:16:38,867 --> 00:16:40,001
Why did he want

365
00:16:40,067 --> 00:16:41,934
these people killed?
I don't know why.

366
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,634
Something to do
with a business deal gone bad.

367
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:46,134
He was going to give me
a six-month supply.

368
00:16:46,201 --> 00:16:47,400
Ooh, well, that worked out well.

369
00:16:47,467 --> 00:16:49,067
The name doesn't
mean anything

370
00:16:49,134 --> 00:16:50,834
unless he can prove
Wolf ordered the hit.

371
00:16:50,901 --> 00:16:52,433
We're not just going to assume
he's telling the truth.

372
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,034
TJ:
It's all true!

373
00:16:54,101 --> 00:16:55,300
I swear to God.

374
00:16:55,367 --> 00:16:56,867
I can't spend my life in prison.

375
00:16:56,934 --> 00:16:58,734
Look, I'll wear a wire.

376
00:16:58,801 --> 00:17:00,333
I'll get him to talk.

377
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,734
I'll get him to say that he told
me to kill those two people.

378
00:17:02,801 --> 00:17:04,134
How do we know you
can even get near him?

379
00:17:04,201 --> 00:17:06,634
Because I just killed
some people for him!

380
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,367
We have a relationship.

381
00:17:08,433 --> 00:17:10,801
He's expecting me to show up
so I can get my payment.

382
00:17:10,867 --> 00:17:11,867
Richard Wolf
is going to find out

383
00:17:11,934 --> 00:17:13,467
you've arrested TJ
anytime now.

384
00:17:13,534 --> 00:17:14,767
Let's make this deal

385
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:17,201
and TJ can lead you to Wolf
before that happens.

386
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:26,777
♪♪♪♪

387
00:17:28,984 --> 00:17:30,784
We can't take this deal.

388
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,750
Oh, we're taking the deal,
Annabeth.

389
00:17:32,984 --> 00:17:34,418
15 years for a
double homicide?

390
00:17:34,483 --> 00:17:35,583
Are you kidding me?

391
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:37,084
Richard Wolf is
the Moby Dick of meth.

392
00:17:37,151 --> 00:17:38,583
He is the whale.

393
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:39,750
The DA starts salivating
at the mention of his name.

394
00:17:39,817 --> 00:17:41,151
It's still a bad deal.

395
00:17:41,217 --> 00:17:43,617
If we get Richard Wolf,
we could lose every drug case

396
00:17:43,684 --> 00:17:45,117
we have on the docket
for the next year

397
00:17:45,184 --> 00:17:46,517
and still be ahead
of the game.

398
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:49,117
Wolf is responsible for a
third of the meth production

399
00:17:49,184 --> 00:17:50,550
in greater Indianapolis.

400
00:17:50,617 --> 00:17:52,217
Meth is tied to 20%
of the murders,

401
00:17:52,284 --> 00:17:54,051
and one in four of
the fires in this city.

402
00:17:54,117 --> 00:17:55,951
What am I supposed to say
to the victim's husband?

403
00:17:56,017 --> 00:17:58,051
15 years is not a slap
on the wrist, Annabeth.

404
00:17:58,117 --> 00:18:01,251
Not in exchange for taking
a drug lord off the streets.

405
00:18:01,318 --> 00:18:02,450
You've got
to think big here.

406
00:18:02,517 --> 00:18:03,817
MAUREEN:
Wait, we have
another problem.

407
00:18:03,884 --> 00:18:05,117
If Wolf ordered the hit,

408
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:07,051
what did James Prichard do
to cross him?

409
00:18:07,117 --> 00:18:08,650
STEVE:
What was Prichard's
line of work again?

410
00:18:08,717 --> 00:18:11,051
Financial services, mortgage,
lending, that sort of thing.

411
00:18:11,117 --> 00:18:12,717
He could have been laundering
Wolf's money,

412
00:18:12,784 --> 00:18:13,917
hiding it in real estate.

413
00:18:13,984 --> 00:18:15,684
Of course it wouldn't hurt
to confront

414
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,450
James Prichard directly and see
how he responds to Wolf's name.

415
00:18:17,517 --> 00:18:19,251
You think you
can handle that?

416
00:18:19,318 --> 00:18:21,650
It's hard to believe
Prichard's involved in meth.

417
00:18:21,717 --> 00:18:23,217
He's such a straight arrow.

418
00:18:23,284 --> 00:18:25,117
But if he is, then we don't have
to take TJ's deal.

419
00:18:25,184 --> 00:18:27,117
I just... I don't want
to give 15 years

420
00:18:27,184 --> 00:18:28,583
to this cold-blooded killer.

421
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,684
There has to be another way
to get Wolf.

422
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,384
How do we know TJ's
even telling the truth?

423
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:35,351
I mean, how do we know
he even knows Richard Wolf?

424
00:18:35,418 --> 00:18:37,917
We do need to corroborate
TJ's connection to Wolf.

425
00:18:37,984 --> 00:18:39,951
But we've got to do it quickly.

426
00:18:40,017 --> 00:18:42,051
The minute we arraign TJ,

427
00:18:42,117 --> 00:18:43,550
Wolf's gonna hear about it,

428
00:18:43,617 --> 00:18:45,884
and then we can't send
TJ in with the wire.

429
00:18:45,951 --> 00:18:48,583
Meantime, let's look into
Prichard's business.

430
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:50,217
If he was working with Wolf,

431
00:18:50,284 --> 00:18:53,483
he must have done something
to make him very, very angry.

432
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:55,550
Your boyfriend's in
a lot of trouble.

433
00:18:55,617 --> 00:18:57,583
I'm going to need you
to give me the names

434
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:59,550
of some of the people
he hangs out with.

435
00:18:59,617 --> 00:19:01,884
How's that supposed
to help TJ?

436
00:19:01,951 --> 00:19:04,717
It could help him spend
less time in prison.

437
00:19:04,784 --> 00:19:07,217
What makes you think
I want him out of prison?

438
00:19:07,284 --> 00:19:11,384
He, uh, listed you as
an emergency contact.

439
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,884
He did?

440
00:19:13,951 --> 00:19:17,051
He's not the most
reliable individual,

441
00:19:17,117 --> 00:19:18,884
he stole stuff
all the time.

442
00:19:18,951 --> 00:19:20,051
Like what?

443
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:22,217
Money, mostly, and...

444
00:19:22,284 --> 00:19:24,418
Drugs?

445
00:19:24,483 --> 00:19:27,351
He ever mention any names?

446
00:19:27,418 --> 00:19:29,418
I don't know.

447
00:19:29,483 --> 00:19:33,318
<i>No, I don't know. Why?
( phone ringing )</i>

448
00:19:34,517 --> 00:19:35,617
I'm coming.

449
00:19:37,251 --> 00:19:39,251
I said I'm coming.

450
00:19:39,318 --> 00:19:40,650
I've got to go.

451
00:19:40,717 --> 00:19:42,984
TJ ever borrow
your cell phone?

452
00:19:43,051 --> 00:19:45,583
Yeah, he stole it
for, like, a month.

453
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:47,251
Guess who had
to pay the bills?

454
00:19:47,318 --> 00:19:48,817
Allison.

455
00:19:48,884 --> 00:19:50,450
Yeah?

456
00:19:50,517 --> 00:19:52,351
What's your cell phone number?

457
00:20:07,017 --> 00:20:08,784
Thank you for coming in
again, Mr. Prichard.

458
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:11,151
You can call me James.

459
00:20:11,217 --> 00:20:13,217
You have an update on the case?

460
00:20:13,284 --> 00:20:15,351
Actually,
we are trying to figure out

461
00:20:15,418 --> 00:20:16,884
if TJ had another motive.

462
00:20:16,951 --> 00:20:17,917
Like what?

463
00:20:17,984 --> 00:20:21,117
TJ claims that he was paid

464
00:20:21,184 --> 00:20:22,984
to kill your wife
and mother-in-law.

465
00:20:23,051 --> 00:20:25,384
What?

466
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:27,450
By someone
who wanted to hurt you,

467
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:29,717
because of a business deal.

468
00:20:29,784 --> 00:20:31,450
Whose business?

469
00:20:31,517 --> 00:20:34,284
Have you ever seen this man?

470
00:20:34,351 --> 00:20:36,184
No.

471
00:20:36,251 --> 00:20:37,617
Why, should I have?

472
00:20:37,684 --> 00:20:40,684
Does the name Richard Wolf
mean anything to you?

473
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:43,650
No, and I'm not answering
any more questions

474
00:20:43,717 --> 00:20:45,951
until you tell me
what's going on.

475
00:20:46,017 --> 00:20:48,951
Okay.

476
00:20:49,017 --> 00:20:51,684
I'm going to tell you something
that's confidential, James.

477
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,251
You can't talk
to anyone about this

478
00:20:53,318 --> 00:20:55,351
or it could contaminate
the jury pool

479
00:20:55,418 --> 00:20:57,550
and the judge will be
forced to change our venue.

480
00:20:57,617 --> 00:21:00,084
None of us want to try
this case in another county.

481
00:21:00,151 --> 00:21:02,318
But I think it's only fair

482
00:21:02,384 --> 00:21:04,784
to let you know...

483
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:10,017
TJ wants to make a deal
with the prosecutor's office.

484
00:21:12,184 --> 00:21:15,284
He'll testify against
a notorious drug lord

485
00:21:15,351 --> 00:21:18,550
if we give him
a lighter sentence.

486
00:21:18,617 --> 00:21:19,951
You promised.

487
00:21:20,017 --> 00:21:21,284
Mr. Prichard.

488
00:21:21,351 --> 00:21:23,450
I can't believe
this is happening.

489
00:21:23,517 --> 00:21:25,450
Nothing has happened yet.
I trusted you.

490
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:27,418
You promised he wasn't
going to get off easy,

491
00:21:27,483 --> 00:21:28,717
like that other little punk.

492
00:21:28,784 --> 00:21:30,251
Can you think of any reason

493
00:21:30,318 --> 00:21:32,284
someone might want to hurt you,
your wife, or her mother?

494
00:21:32,351 --> 00:21:34,418
You think this is because
something I did?

495
00:21:34,483 --> 00:21:37,550
I approve homeowner
refinancing packages.

496
00:21:37,617 --> 00:21:40,217
I stare at paperwork
all day long.

497
00:21:40,284 --> 00:21:42,084
Julie worked
at the children's section

498
00:21:42,151 --> 00:21:44,318
of the public library,
for Pete's sake.

499
00:21:44,384 --> 00:21:46,650
Her mother made meals
for the disabled.

500
00:21:46,717 --> 00:21:48,151
Do you understand?

501
00:21:48,217 --> 00:21:50,217
Do you get it?

502
00:21:50,284 --> 00:21:51,617
They're both dead now.

503
00:21:51,684 --> 00:21:54,251
You want to use that
to put away some drug guy?

504
00:21:54,318 --> 00:21:56,117
I'm done talking to you.

505
00:21:56,184 --> 00:21:57,151
Please, sit down.

506
00:21:57,217 --> 00:21:58,750
You have the man
who killed them.

507
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,251
Do your job.

508
00:22:00,318 --> 00:22:01,784
Put him away forever.

509
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:03,650
And leave me alone.

510
00:22:12,884 --> 00:22:15,951
They just got married last year.

511
00:22:16,017 --> 00:22:18,917
They were the same age
as us, Jack.

512
00:22:18,984 --> 00:22:20,318
He's just devastated.

513
00:22:20,384 --> 00:22:21,318
They have any kids?

514
00:22:21,384 --> 00:22:24,051
No, but they were trying.

515
00:22:24,117 --> 00:22:26,550
Jack, that poor man's going
to spend the rest of his life

516
00:22:26,617 --> 00:22:29,517
beating himself up for
not being home that night.

517
00:22:29,583 --> 00:22:30,850
Well,
I would, too.

518
00:22:33,051 --> 00:22:35,450
Who do you think
is more guilty,

519
00:22:35,517 --> 00:22:37,450
the meth head who
shot those poor women,

520
00:22:37,517 --> 00:22:40,184
or the kingpin
who hired him to do it?

521
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:46,784
What about the kid
driving the getaway car?

522
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:48,017
He didn't know about it.

523
00:22:48,084 --> 00:22:49,550
He's basically a bystander.

524
00:22:49,617 --> 00:22:51,750
He drove
the guy away.

525
00:22:51,817 --> 00:22:53,284
Isn't that a crime?

526
00:22:53,351 --> 00:22:55,817
Yeah, I could try to nail him.

527
00:22:55,884 --> 00:22:57,184
But he's cooperated,

528
00:22:57,251 --> 00:22:59,184
and he's going to help me
put the shooter away.

529
00:22:59,251 --> 00:23:02,650
So, basically you
got three bad guys.

530
00:23:02,717 --> 00:23:05,650
You got your dumb kid,

531
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:07,318
you got a guy who
squeezed the trigger,

532
00:23:07,384 --> 00:23:09,418
and then you got the guy
that ordered the killing.

533
00:23:09,483 --> 00:23:10,617
Yeah.

534
00:23:10,684 --> 00:23:12,583
The shooter says
he was following orders.

535
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:14,151
Yeah, isn't that
what they all say?

536
00:23:14,217 --> 00:23:17,517
They were
"following orders?"

537
00:23:17,583 --> 00:23:19,418
I mean, both of them
had to be willing,

538
00:23:19,483 --> 00:23:21,084
otherwise the whole thing
wouldn't have happened.

539
00:23:21,151 --> 00:23:22,251
Exactly.

540
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:25,284
You're making
deals all day?

541
00:23:25,351 --> 00:23:26,717
One guy to get to
another guy,

542
00:23:26,784 --> 00:23:28,784
to get to
another guy?

543
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:30,850
Yeah.

544
00:23:30,917 --> 00:23:34,384
I have to you...
it's wearing me out.

545
00:23:36,483 --> 00:23:37,418
Come here.

546
00:23:37,483 --> 00:23:40,117
Let me see this.

547
00:23:54,684 --> 00:23:56,617
Now, looking at these calls,

548
00:23:56,684 --> 00:23:58,784
when the girlfriend's cell phone

549
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:02,017
was in TJ's possession,

550
00:24:02,084 --> 00:24:03,318
you'll see a spate of calls

551
00:24:03,384 --> 00:24:06,084
over a two-day span
for the same number.

552
00:24:06,151 --> 00:24:07,717
That would be
a two-day span

553
00:24:07,784 --> 00:24:09,418
right before
the murders went down.

554
00:24:09,483 --> 00:24:11,051
And this number
belongs to?

555
00:24:11,117 --> 00:24:12,051
One of Wolf's
underlings.

556
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:14,051
Ronny Winkler.

557
00:24:14,117 --> 00:24:18,951
Oh, so it seems that
TJ was connected to Wolf.

558
00:24:19,017 --> 00:24:20,384
What about James?

559
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:21,784
He's in hell.

560
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:23,251
I mean, he's grieving
for his wife.

561
00:24:23,318 --> 00:24:24,384
I don't think he knows

562
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:26,351
anything about
Richard Wolf.

563
00:24:26,418 --> 00:24:28,850
Well, you might want
to rethink that.

564
00:24:28,917 --> 00:24:29,850
Why? What?

565
00:24:29,917 --> 00:24:31,051
Two months ago,

566
00:24:31,117 --> 00:24:32,917
a backup computer tape
went missing

567
00:24:32,984 --> 00:24:34,684
from James Prichard's office.

568
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:35,951
How could that
tie to Wolf?

569
00:24:36,017 --> 00:24:37,217
The computer tape had

570
00:24:37,284 --> 00:24:39,117
over 30,000 credit
applications on it.

571
00:24:39,184 --> 00:24:40,784
One tape?
Easy.

572
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:43,051
Probably fetch somewhere
in the low six figures.

573
00:24:43,117 --> 00:24:46,717
Meth addicts steal IDs
for the dealers

574
00:24:46,784 --> 00:24:48,117
who pay them in drugs.

575
00:24:48,184 --> 00:24:49,217
They go through your trash,

576
00:24:49,284 --> 00:24:51,284
they steal your mail.

577
00:24:51,351 --> 00:24:54,483
The dealers take those IDs
and sell them to people

578
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:55,951
who convert them
into actual cash.

579
00:24:56,017 --> 00:24:58,583
The value of the stolen IDs
are based on

580
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:00,051
the person's credit limits.

581
00:25:00,117 --> 00:25:01,650
But James Prichard's
not a meth addict.

582
00:25:01,717 --> 00:25:03,583
True, but the big dealers
are now

583
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:05,084
skipping right over
the addicts

584
00:25:05,151 --> 00:25:07,284
and buying
credit information

585
00:25:07,351 --> 00:25:10,017
from anyone
who has insider access.

586
00:25:10,084 --> 00:25:12,583
Insiders like Prichard.

587
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:14,017
Dealers are making
as much

588
00:25:14,084 --> 00:25:16,151
or more from ID theft
as from drugs.

589
00:25:16,217 --> 00:25:19,151
That money buys
chemicals,

590
00:25:19,217 --> 00:25:21,284
the chemicals make
more drugs,

591
00:25:21,351 --> 00:25:23,117
which make more drug addicts,

592
00:25:23,184 --> 00:25:27,184
who steal more IDs,
and the circle is complete.

593
00:25:27,251 --> 00:25:29,051
But we don't have any
real evidence that James

594
00:25:29,117 --> 00:25:30,817
was involved in
stealing those IDs.

595
00:25:30,884 --> 00:25:32,318
Only that it appears
that Wolf had

596
00:25:32,384 --> 00:25:33,717
his wife and
mother-in-law killed.

597
00:25:33,784 --> 00:25:36,017
That points to
some kind of
connection.

598
00:25:36,084 --> 00:25:38,850
Maybe he was being forced
into working with Wolf.

599
00:25:38,917 --> 00:25:40,850
Theoretical.

600
00:25:40,917 --> 00:25:42,850
Maybe he decided to quit,
and Richard decided to get even.

601
00:25:42,917 --> 00:25:44,284
Again, theoretical.

602
00:25:45,951 --> 00:25:46,884
Go back to friends,

603
00:25:46,951 --> 00:25:49,217
neighbors,
coworkers.

604
00:25:49,284 --> 00:25:52,717
See if anyone in Prichard's life
found anything suspicious.

605
00:25:54,384 --> 00:25:55,351
Annabeth?

606
00:25:55,418 --> 00:25:56,418
I'm sorry.

607
00:25:56,483 --> 00:25:57,951
I'm just trying to get my head

608
00:25:58,017 --> 00:25:59,351
around the possibility
that this guy's been playing me,

609
00:25:59,418 --> 00:26:02,251
and it's really
hard to believe.

610
00:26:02,318 --> 00:26:03,850
Duly noted.

611
00:26:03,917 --> 00:26:06,418
But remember, we're trying
to get to Wolf without TJ.

612
00:26:06,951 --> 00:26:07,817
Hey--

613
00:26:07,884 --> 00:26:08,850
you're the one who wanted

614
00:26:08,917 --> 00:26:10,117
to have her cake and
eat it, too.

615
00:26:14,784 --> 00:26:16,984
Afraid not.
Never seen him.

616
00:26:17,051 --> 00:26:18,217
Is there anything else

617
00:26:18,284 --> 00:26:19,517
that sticks out
in your mind

618
00:26:19,583 --> 00:26:21,284
from that night?

619
00:26:21,351 --> 00:26:22,583
Well, there was something.

620
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:25,017
It probably doesn't
mean anything.

621
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:26,650
It happened the night
after the murders.

622
00:26:26,717 --> 00:26:29,351
After?

623
00:26:29,418 --> 00:26:32,084
See that house across the street
from the Prichards?

624
00:26:32,151 --> 00:26:34,984
That's the Alavi family
that lives there.

625
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:35,984
Nice enough couple.

626
00:26:36,051 --> 00:26:38,351
Two darling little girls.

627
00:26:38,418 --> 00:26:40,384
The night after the murders,

628
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:42,784
I took my little dog out
before bedtime,

629
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:45,117
and I saw them
rushing around,

630
00:26:45,184 --> 00:26:46,483
throwing things
into their car

631
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:48,450
and then they just
took off.

632
00:26:48,517 --> 00:26:51,617
<i>Kids and everything.</i>

633
00:26:51,684 --> 00:26:52,750
They left when?

634
00:26:52,817 --> 00:26:54,318
The day after
the murders.

635
00:26:56,951 --> 00:26:58,217
ANNABETH:
The woman deadheads

636
00:26:58,284 --> 00:27:00,351
her roses but leaves
the milk out to spoil?

637
00:27:00,418 --> 00:27:02,583
It looks like they
left in a hurry.

638
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:05,318
Well, there's a week's
worth of mail

639
00:27:05,384 --> 00:27:07,084
left in the mailbox,

640
00:27:07,151 --> 00:27:09,351
and nobody called
to cancel the newspaper.

641
00:27:09,418 --> 00:27:11,984
I talked to the husband,
a Vashar Alavi,

642
00:27:12,051 --> 00:27:13,450
the day of the murders.

643
00:27:13,517 --> 00:27:16,017
He was a little
on edge.

644
00:27:16,084 --> 00:27:17,583
Check this out.

645
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:20,817
Look at the victim's house.

646
00:27:22,017 --> 00:27:23,418
Okay, imagine the possibility.

647
00:27:24,483 --> 00:27:25,483
TJ's high.

648
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:26,817
He's wired.

649
00:27:26,884 --> 00:27:31,084
He's been told
5461 Tennessee Court.

650
00:27:31,151 --> 00:27:34,717
5467 is across the street.

651
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:39,051
Seven looks
a lot like a one.

652
00:27:39,117 --> 00:27:42,117
You think TJ killed
the wrong people?

653
00:27:42,184 --> 00:27:43,418
That's why the Prichard
connection to Wolf

654
00:27:43,517 --> 00:27:44,717
never made any sense.

655
00:27:44,784 --> 00:27:48,784
Richard Wolf wanted
these people dead,

656
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:49,951
and they knew it, Lou.

657
00:27:50,017 --> 00:27:51,151
They knew
they were the targets.

658
00:27:51,217 --> 00:27:52,784
That's why they left
in such a hurry.

659
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:54,650
That's why they packed up
their kids and ran.

660
00:27:54,717 --> 00:27:57,318
<i>Well, we still don't know
why they were the targets.</i>

661
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,960
♪♪♪♪

662
00:28:04,977 --> 00:28:06,743
hink TJ screwed up
and killed the wrong people.

663
00:28:07,311 --> 00:28:08,411
The wrong people?

664
00:28:08,477 --> 00:28:09,743
It looks like
the hit was meant

665
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:11,144
for the neighbors
across the street.

666
00:28:11,211 --> 00:28:13,044
They moved out in a hurry,
right after the murders,

667
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:14,477
but no one knows
where they went.

668
00:28:14,544 --> 00:28:15,544
If that's true,

669
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:16,810
then James Prichard
is not

670
00:28:16,877 --> 00:28:18,411
the connection
to prosecuting Wolf.
Correct.

671
00:28:18,477 --> 00:28:19,678
Which you've been
saying all along.

672
00:28:19,743 --> 00:28:21,110
Hat's off.

673
00:28:21,177 --> 00:28:22,977
But that also means that
we're no more capable

674
00:28:23,044 --> 00:28:25,077
of nailing Wolf today
than we were yesterday.

675
00:28:25,144 --> 00:28:27,377
Ergo, we need
TJ's testimony.

676
00:28:27,444 --> 00:28:29,177
Unless we find
the neighbors.

677
00:28:29,244 --> 00:28:31,110
You just told me
you don't know
where they are.

678
00:28:31,177 --> 00:28:33,977
Vashar Alavi owned a dry
cleaning business downtown,

679
00:28:34,044 --> 00:28:35,777
and he's originally
from Iran.

680
00:28:35,843 --> 00:28:36,910
Iran?

681
00:28:36,977 --> 00:28:38,877
Well, then
he's long gone.

682
00:28:38,944 --> 00:28:40,377
That's one of
the few places

683
00:28:40,444 --> 00:28:42,678
that Richard Wolf
can't find him.

684
00:28:42,743 --> 00:28:44,110
You need to talk to TJ.

685
00:28:44,177 --> 00:28:46,144
Steve.

686
00:28:46,211 --> 00:28:48,144
I promised James Prichard.

687
00:28:48,211 --> 00:28:50,611
I gave him my word
I wouldn't let TJ walk.

688
00:28:52,144 --> 00:28:53,211
Annabeth,

689
00:28:53,277 --> 00:28:54,810
you know
you can't promise

690
00:28:54,877 --> 00:28:56,477
anyone anything
in this business.

691
00:28:56,544 --> 00:28:58,444
If we, as an office,

692
00:28:58,511 --> 00:28:59,678
choose to throw
the little fish

693
00:28:59,743 --> 00:29:00,944
back to catch
the big fish,

694
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:02,077
we have to be able
to do that

695
00:29:02,144 --> 00:29:02,977
without you
getting in the way

696
00:29:03,044 --> 00:29:04,344
with your promises.

697
00:29:04,411 --> 00:29:06,477
The "little fish"
shot and killed two women.

698
00:29:06,544 --> 00:29:07,977
Mrs. Prichard was 29 years old.

699
00:29:08,044 --> 00:29:09,010
You still shouldn't have
promised anything.

700
00:29:09,077 --> 00:29:10,311
You're right, Steve, but I did.

701
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:14,144
What do you want?

702
00:29:14,211 --> 00:29:17,477
I want TJ to get
what he deserves,

703
00:29:17,544 --> 00:29:18,578
and I want
Richard Wolf.

704
00:29:18,644 --> 00:29:20,010
But to have
any hope of that,

705
00:29:20,077 --> 00:29:22,644
I need time to find
these missing people.

706
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:24,910
We arraign TJ
at 3:00 tomorrow.

707
00:29:24,977 --> 00:29:26,177
That's all the time
you're getting.

708
00:29:26,244 --> 00:29:28,311
If you can't
find him by then,

709
00:29:28,377 --> 00:29:30,311
we take the deal.

710
00:29:32,743 --> 00:29:35,311
The Department
of Environmental Management

711
00:29:35,377 --> 00:29:37,077
requires every dry cleaner

712
00:29:37,144 --> 00:29:38,177
to keep a purchase log

713
00:29:38,244 --> 00:29:39,843
of this particular
chemical.

714
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:41,244
It's called "perc"?

715
00:29:41,311 --> 00:29:42,477
Chloral Ethylene.

716
00:29:42,544 --> 00:29:44,311
Also known as perc.
And guess what?

717
00:29:44,377 --> 00:29:46,611
Perc happens to be
the latest craze

718
00:29:46,678 --> 00:29:48,344
among larger meth lab
operations.

719
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:52,544
It speeds up
the methamphetamine
drying process,

720
00:29:52,611 --> 00:29:54,678
while simultaneously
stretching

721
00:29:54,743 --> 00:29:56,910
the bulk of
the final product.

722
00:29:56,977 --> 00:29:58,444
Basically,
your user winds up

723
00:29:58,511 --> 00:30:00,211
smoking dry cleaning
fluid

724
00:30:00,277 --> 00:30:02,110
with some meth
mixed in.

725
00:30:02,177 --> 00:30:04,377
And, let me guess, it also
makes it more addictive?

726
00:30:04,444 --> 00:30:05,678
Everybody wins.

727
00:30:05,743 --> 00:30:07,311
So, tell me why
this log's important.

728
00:30:07,377 --> 00:30:09,944
Well, about seven months ago,
Mr. Alavi reported

729
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:13,144
some perc being stolen
right around here.

730
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:14,144
Who stole it?

731
00:30:14,211 --> 00:30:16,144
Police never
solved it.

732
00:30:16,211 --> 00:30:17,678
But if you notice
from this log,

733
00:30:17,743 --> 00:30:20,077
perc purchases
nearly tripled

734
00:30:20,144 --> 00:30:21,644
immediately following
the theft.

735
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:23,544
Well, whatever went down,
it sounds like Mr. Alavi's

736
00:30:23,611 --> 00:30:24,710
in the meth supply business.

737
00:30:24,777 --> 00:30:26,010
Well, either that
or he's planning

738
00:30:26,077 --> 00:30:27,311
on opening three more
dry cleaners.

739
00:30:27,377 --> 00:30:30,077
We've got to find
these people.

740
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:32,177
I've got the paralegals
checking the airlines,

741
00:30:32,244 --> 00:30:33,777
Border Patrol,
State Department.

742
00:30:33,843 --> 00:30:36,077
If they've left, there
will be a paper trail.

743
00:30:36,144 --> 00:30:37,377
So if we don't find anything,

744
00:30:37,444 --> 00:30:38,777
it could mean they're
still in Indianapolis?

745
00:30:40,077 --> 00:30:41,644
Let's hope we come up
empty-handed.

746
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:42,710
Mm.

747
00:30:43,977 --> 00:30:47,244
Could you check out
the passport info

748
00:30:47,311 --> 00:30:49,344
on these folks
for me, please?

749
00:30:49,411 --> 00:30:50,444
Thanks.

750
00:31:17,277 --> 00:31:21,110
It's a family of four,
two girls.

751
00:31:21,177 --> 00:31:24,211
They would have checked in
last week.

752
00:31:24,277 --> 00:31:26,144
DRUMMER:
They tried to book
tickets to Iran,

753
00:31:26,211 --> 00:31:28,843
Lauren Alavi,
the littlest girl,

754
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:30,311
she couldn't get out.

755
00:31:30,377 --> 00:31:31,743
She was born
in this country,

756
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:33,777
so she's never had
a passport.

757
00:31:33,843 --> 00:31:36,377
Now, her parents filed
an expedited application.

758
00:31:36,444 --> 00:31:37,910
But with an
Iranian father...

759
00:31:37,977 --> 00:31:40,044
Well, the State Department
is taking its time.

760
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:43,311
I figured the guy didn't want
to leave his family behind.

761
00:31:43,377 --> 00:31:45,810
So, they're still here,
we just don't know where.

762
00:31:45,877 --> 00:31:49,877
I had Juliet call every
hotel in Indianapolis.

763
00:31:49,944 --> 00:31:51,244
She found a match of

764
00:31:51,311 --> 00:31:52,578
three families
with two little girls,

765
00:31:52,644 --> 00:31:54,644
but only one paid
for everything in cash,

766
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:57,578
and only one didn't
provide a checkout date.

767
00:31:57,644 --> 00:31:59,411
You are so good.

768
00:31:59,477 --> 00:32:00,810
I can be.

769
00:32:09,977 --> 00:32:11,644
Indianapolis Police!

770
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:32,311
MAN:
Open the door
and I will shoot!

771
00:32:32,377 --> 00:32:34,077
Drop your weapon!
It's the police!

772
00:32:34,144 --> 00:32:35,144
Mr. Alavi!

773
00:32:39,678 --> 00:32:43,444
We're here to talk
about Richard Wolf.

774
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:49,010
Do not shoot!

775
00:32:49,077 --> 00:32:51,411
My hands are
up in the air!

776
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,777
<i>DRUMMER:
We know you were supplying
Richard Wolf</i>

777
00:33:00,843 --> 00:33:02,644
with perc, Mr. Alavi.

778
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:04,010
Now, that's a felony.

779
00:33:04,077 --> 00:33:05,477
I don't think
you can prove this.

780
00:33:05,544 --> 00:33:07,743
We have documentation
showing that you ordered

781
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:08,843
far more chemicals per month

782
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:11,511
than you could
possibly use.

783
00:33:11,578 --> 00:33:13,743
Please, my husband's
health is very bad.

784
00:33:15,311 --> 00:33:16,411
I must think of
my wife

785
00:33:16,477 --> 00:33:17,810
and my children.

786
00:33:17,877 --> 00:33:19,810
If I help you,
they will kill all of us.

787
00:33:19,877 --> 00:33:22,010
Actually, as long
as Richard Wolf is free,

788
00:33:22,077 --> 00:33:23,910
he will try and hunt you down.

789
00:33:23,977 --> 00:33:25,544
If you cooperate,

790
00:33:25,611 --> 00:33:27,644
we can get him
off the streets.

791
00:33:30,977 --> 00:33:33,010
We can provide you
with new identities,

792
00:33:33,077 --> 00:33:34,444
get you in

793
00:33:34,511 --> 00:33:35,843
the Witness
Protection program.

794
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:38,144
It'll be
a new start.

795
00:33:38,211 --> 00:33:40,477
Vashi-zam, think of
the girls.

796
00:33:49,678 --> 00:33:51,277
Tell me what I can do.

797
00:33:54,010 --> 00:33:56,077
Well, you can start
by telling me

798
00:33:56,144 --> 00:33:59,044
why Richard Wolf wants you dead.

799
00:34:05,481 --> 00:34:06,714
arch,

800
00:34:06,781 --> 00:34:09,047
I see that my storage area
is empty.

801
00:34:09,114 --> 00:34:10,381
Someone has cut the lock

802
00:34:10,447 --> 00:34:13,714
and removed all the solvents,
the perc.

803
00:34:13,781 --> 00:34:15,381
So I called the police.

804
00:34:15,447 --> 00:34:17,880
They make a report,
but nothing happens.

805
00:34:17,947 --> 00:34:21,047
Then not long after,
some men come to me

806
00:34:21,114 --> 00:34:23,247
and say we took the perc,

807
00:34:23,314 --> 00:34:26,080
and now we're going to pay you
to give it to us.

808
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:29,080
This is bad, I said no,
I don't want to get paid.

809
00:34:29,147 --> 00:34:33,080
But they say they
will kill me if I refuse.

810
00:34:33,147 --> 00:34:38,080
They work for a very big man,
Richard Wolf.

811
00:34:38,147 --> 00:34:40,848
What am I gonna do?

812
00:34:40,913 --> 00:34:45,514
So this goes on for some months
and I don't tell my wife.

813
00:34:45,581 --> 00:34:48,514
And my doctor says
I have a bleeding ulcer.

814
00:34:48,581 --> 00:34:54,681
And one day she asks me
what's wrong and so I tell her.

815
00:34:54,748 --> 00:34:58,047
She tells me it has to stop.

816
00:34:58,114 --> 00:35:02,547
How did Richard Wolf
pay you?

817
00:35:02,614 --> 00:35:06,214
They took my bank account number
and put the money in there.

818
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:09,214
They told me if I tried to tell
anyone, I will go to jail

819
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:14,481
because the police will see
that I'm getting paid.

820
00:35:14,547 --> 00:35:15,714
So you think
we got enough?

821
00:35:15,781 --> 00:35:17,013
We got it all.

822
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,814
Mr. Alavi can prove
Wolf was paying him

823
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,714
and when he stopped
supplying chemicals,

824
00:35:20,781 --> 00:35:22,047
Wolf threatened
to kill him.

825
00:35:22,114 --> 00:35:23,381
And the meth labs?

826
00:35:23,447 --> 00:35:24,714
Alavi is taking the police

827
00:35:24,781 --> 00:35:26,214
to where he delivered
the chemicals,

828
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:29,581
and we expedited
an arrest warrant for Wolf.

829
00:35:29,647 --> 00:35:33,581
So we're hoping these are
his last free hours on Earth.

830
00:35:33,647 --> 00:35:37,247
Becky, I bet
you're looking for me.

831
00:35:37,314 --> 00:35:39,347
You are aware that TJ's
being arraigned at 3:00?

832
00:35:39,414 --> 00:35:42,180
We were just talking
about what we should wear.

833
00:35:42,247 --> 00:35:44,514
I'm in olive, but do you think
pinstripes are better?

834
00:35:44,581 --> 00:35:46,514
Yeah.
Olive brings out
my eyes.

835
00:35:46,581 --> 00:35:48,013
If you want to make this deal
with TJ,

836
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,581
this is your last chance.

837
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:52,347
Actually, we
found another way
to get Wolf, so...

838
00:35:52,414 --> 00:35:53,848
So don't despair,

839
00:35:53,913 --> 00:35:56,347
you were offering 15 years
if TJ wore a wire.

840
00:35:56,414 --> 00:35:58,180
Yes?

841
00:35:58,247 --> 00:35:59,381
Well, how does

842
00:35:59,447 --> 00:36:00,980
30 years to life sound
if he testifies

843
00:36:01,047 --> 00:36:02,748
that Richard ordered him
to make the hit?

844
00:36:02,814 --> 00:36:04,947
Or?
Or, I'd guess

845
00:36:05,013 --> 00:36:06,414
we'd have to up the charges

846
00:36:06,481 --> 00:36:08,614
to whatever
we're charging Richard with.

847
00:36:20,947 --> 00:36:22,714
So that's him?

848
00:36:22,781 --> 00:36:24,047
That's Richard Wolf?

849
00:36:24,114 --> 00:36:25,547
The one, the only.

850
00:36:25,614 --> 00:36:26,714
He looks smaller
in person.

851
00:36:26,781 --> 00:36:28,381
Drummer.

852
00:36:28,447 --> 00:36:31,781
Rachel, call my lawyer.

853
00:36:34,947 --> 00:36:36,581
Yeah.

854
00:36:36,647 --> 00:36:38,681
They found the meth lab
in a warehouse downtown.

855
00:36:38,748 --> 00:36:40,581
They're going in.

856
00:36:57,414 --> 00:37:00,013
ANNABETH:
Sonya?

857
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,848
What's wrong?

858
00:37:01,913 --> 00:37:03,514
He was fine,

859
00:37:03,581 --> 00:37:04,848
and then...

860
00:37:04,913 --> 00:37:06,781
I saw Richard Wolf
down the hall.

861
00:37:06,848 --> 00:37:09,481
SONYA:
It was just
for one second,

862
00:37:09,547 --> 00:37:11,714
and now his stomach is...

863
00:37:11,781 --> 00:37:13,347
I don't think...

864
00:37:14,748 --> 00:37:16,848
Not today.
Mr. Alavi,

865
00:37:16,913 --> 00:37:18,381
I'm going to be right in there
with you.

866
00:37:18,447 --> 00:37:19,714
There's nothing to worry about.

867
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:24,214
Do you want me to
get you some water?

868
00:37:25,447 --> 00:37:27,880
I just wanted to thank you
for coming.

869
00:37:27,947 --> 00:37:30,180
Mr. Prichard, I, uh...

870
00:37:30,247 --> 00:37:31,314
How are the girls?

871
00:37:31,381 --> 00:37:33,514
They're well. Thank you.

872
00:37:33,581 --> 00:37:35,180
You know, sometimes
the only blessing

873
00:37:35,247 --> 00:37:37,013
I can think of
out of all of this,

874
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,814
is that your girls
are still alive.

875
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,314
Would you do me a favor?

876
00:37:41,381 --> 00:37:44,381
Sure. Anything.

877
00:37:44,447 --> 00:37:46,947
Make sure you put him away
in there today.

878
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:51,481
That I will do.

879
00:37:51,547 --> 00:37:53,214
I'm counting on you.

880
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:00,581
Please, I'm ready.

881
00:38:00,647 --> 00:38:03,180
Okay.

882
00:38:05,214 --> 00:38:09,180
You knew it was illegal to sell
these chemicals to Mr. Wolf.

883
00:38:09,247 --> 00:38:10,314
Yes.

884
00:38:10,381 --> 00:38:12,013
So why did you continue?

885
00:38:14,047 --> 00:38:15,848
He threatened to come
to my house and kill me

886
00:38:15,947 --> 00:38:17,748
if I ever refused.

887
00:38:17,814 --> 00:38:19,647
But you did stop.

888
00:38:24,114 --> 00:38:26,414
Yes, I wanted out of all of it.

889
00:38:26,481 --> 00:38:28,080
What happened then?

890
00:38:28,147 --> 00:38:30,214
Mr. Wolf called
to warn me.

891
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,214
I begged him to
let me out of it,

892
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,714
but he said he wasn't
playing games.

893
00:38:34,781 --> 00:38:36,514
What happened next?

894
00:38:36,581 --> 00:38:39,481
I...

895
00:38:39,547 --> 00:38:41,347
I bought a gun.

896
00:38:41,414 --> 00:38:45,381
You thought
you could protect yourself?

897
00:38:47,013 --> 00:38:50,347
I was desperate.

898
00:38:50,414 --> 00:38:53,347
And we quickly made a plan
to leave,

899
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:56,147
but then we realized

900
00:38:56,214 --> 00:38:58,913
we didn't have a passport
for my youngest daughter.

901
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:02,013
And then that night...

902
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:06,013
the neighbors in the house
across the street were killed.

903
00:39:07,047 --> 00:39:09,681
It was horrible.

904
00:39:09,748 --> 00:39:12,748
The next day
the police are everywhere,

905
00:39:12,814 --> 00:39:14,180
so when it got dark,

906
00:39:14,247 --> 00:39:17,314
we took the girls
and we ran away.

907
00:39:17,381 --> 00:39:21,681
Can you please point out
Mr. Wolf in the courtroom today?

908
00:39:22,814 --> 00:39:24,481
TJ:
That's him, there.

909
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:30,614
Did Mr. Wolf pay you
to commit murder?

910
00:39:32,013 --> 00:39:35,414
Yes. Not in money, in drugs.

911
00:39:35,481 --> 00:39:37,147
What did he tell you exactly?

912
00:39:37,214 --> 00:39:40,114
He told me to go
to 5461 Tennessee Court.

913
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:42,681
But you didn't go to that house.

914
00:39:42,748 --> 00:39:45,214
I was high on meth,

915
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:50,180
and I screwed up 5461 with 5467.

916
00:39:50,247 --> 00:39:52,013
What else did he tell you to do?

917
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:57,748
<i>( swallows hard )
He told me to...</i>

918
00:39:57,814 --> 00:39:59,848
shoot the whole family,

919
00:39:59,913 --> 00:40:02,314
even the kids.

920
00:40:02,381 --> 00:40:04,880
But there weren't any kids.

921
00:40:06,714 --> 00:40:09,180
Because I got the wrong house.

922
00:40:09,247 --> 00:40:11,347
But I was so wasted.

923
00:40:11,414 --> 00:40:14,880
If there had been any kids,

924
00:40:14,947 --> 00:40:18,080
I'd have killed them, too.

925
00:40:53,581 --> 00:40:56,381
"On the first count
of conspiracy to commit murder,

926
00:40:56,447 --> 00:40:59,748
"we, the jury, find the
defendant, Richard Robert Wolf,

927
00:40:59,814 --> 00:41:01,314
guilty."

928
00:41:08,013 --> 00:41:11,247
"On the second count
of conspiracy to commit murder,

929
00:41:11,314 --> 00:41:14,080
"we find the defendant,
Richard Robert Wolf,

930
00:41:14,147 --> 00:41:16,013
guilty."

931
00:41:52,781 --> 00:41:55,381
JACK:
I like it when you win.

932
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,714
What did Wolf get?

933
00:42:01,781 --> 00:42:03,214
L-WOP.

934
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,047
Life without parole.

935
00:42:05,114 --> 00:42:07,714
I like it.

936
00:42:07,781 --> 00:42:11,080
You know, I'm still
holding you to that deal.

937
00:42:11,147 --> 00:42:15,247
Oh... it was...
it was a back rub.

938
00:42:15,314 --> 00:42:17,114
No, no.
Actually, I think

939
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:20,581
it was you washing the dishes
in the morning.

940
00:42:20,647 --> 00:42:22,247
Right, right.

941
00:42:23,814 --> 00:42:26,247
Baby, I'd clean the whole
damn kitchen for you.
