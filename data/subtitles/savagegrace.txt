1
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:19,380
<i>I was eating a tomato
at teatime a few weeks ago,</i>

2
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:23,140
<i>And I suddenly realized
that Mummy is not dead at all...</i>

3
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:26,100
<i>Just very, very mysterious.</i>

4
00:00:29,855 --> 00:00:33,500
<i>Papa spoke languages,
climbed mountains.</i>

5
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,260
<i>He was an adventurer.</i>

6
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:41,820
<i>But Mummy was
such a gifted person socially.</i>

7
00:00:41,825 --> 00:00:44,700
<i>She was a master
of the understatement,</i>

8
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,235
<i>an adventuress.</i>

9
00:00:52,565 --> 00:00:55,440
<i>And he was cold and dark,</i>

10
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,975
<i>and she was warm and light.</i>

11
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:03,535
<i>And I was "little Tony. "</i>

12
00:01:03,535 --> 00:01:06,300
<i>- Bye. Your mummy loves you.</i>

13
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,520
<i>I was the steam
when hot meets cold.</i>

14
00:01:11,862 --> 00:01:14,930
<i>(woman) Midge? Well, hello.</i>

15
00:01:14,931 --> 00:01:17,691
The reason that I called, darling,
is that Aschwin,

16
00:01:17,692 --> 00:01:19,418
Prince Aschwin Lippe -

17
00:01:19,419 --> 00:01:21,605
his brother is Prince Bernhard -

18
00:01:21,606 --> 00:01:25,440
well, Aschwin thought it would be lovely
to meet at the Stork Club tonight.

19
00:01:25,441 --> 00:01:29,238
He so wants to know you and Joost,
and asked if I could...

20
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:30,850
Well, of course.

21
00:01:30,851 --> 00:01:34,381
Shall we say... 10:30?

22
00:01:34,802 --> 00:01:37,604
Is that too Continental?

23
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:46,194
Be as catty as you want, but Tony
can hear every word you're saying.

24
00:01:46,195 --> 00:01:49,726
Can you imagine
the world he's growing up into?

25
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:53,984
Brooks and I will see you tonight.

26
00:01:56,131 --> 00:01:58,278
Brooks...

27
00:01:58,279 --> 00:02:00,697
darling.

28
00:02:02,537 --> 00:02:06,758
I gather that
you're making commitments for me.

29
00:02:07,908 --> 00:02:11,707
Sans permission,
sans consultation.

30
00:02:15,197 --> 00:02:18,533
Prince Aschwin de Lippe, please.

31
00:02:18,534 --> 00:02:21,796
You may say
Barbara Baekeland is calling.

32
00:02:21,948 --> 00:02:24,403
Don't get difficult,
not tonight, darling.

33
00:02:24,404 --> 00:02:27,471
Please forgive the intrusion
and the damnably short notice,

34
00:02:27,472 --> 00:02:30,310
but we are having supper
with Midge and Joost van den Heuvel,

35
00:02:30,311 --> 00:02:34,069
and they would so like
the pleasure of your company.

36
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:37,101
They'll be delighted.

37
00:02:37,102 --> 00:02:38,865
As will I.

38
00:02:38,866 --> 00:02:42,052
As will Brooks.

39
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,578
Thank you, darling.

40
00:02:45,579 --> 00:02:52,215
<i>People say now that I must have hated
them because of what... transpired...</i>

41
00:02:52,216 --> 00:02:54,900
We won't be back too late,
I promise.

42
00:02:54,901 --> 00:03:00,079
<i>...but everything that happened
happened because of love.</i>

43
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,498
Do I...

44
00:03:03,264 --> 00:03:06,140
Do I look like a monkey to you?

45
00:03:06,141 --> 00:03:11,166
Then why on earth should I get dressed up
in a fucking monkey suit just to eat?

46
00:03:11,167 --> 00:03:14,350
You don't have to wear your tux.
And no need to be vulgar.

47
00:03:14,351 --> 00:03:17,227
- In front of the b-o-y?
- Just wear your uniform.

48
00:03:17,228 --> 00:03:20,871
- I will not.
- You look so handsome in your uniform.

49
00:03:20,872 --> 00:03:23,479
The war is over.
Had you not heard?

50
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,780
You have a right.
You won the war.

51
00:03:25,781 --> 00:03:30,769
I mean, you volunteered,
so you have a right to wear your uniform.

52
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:34,029
Your father looked so handsome,
so dashing.

53
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,409
So dashing.

54
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:41,662
Is the little paragon coming with,
or do you plan on leaving him here alone?

55
00:03:41,663 --> 00:03:43,428
Nini will be here at nine.

56
00:03:43,429 --> 00:03:47,573
In that case,
I'm glad that I shall be dining out.

57
00:03:56,318 --> 00:03:58,004
Tone. Tony, Tony...

58
00:03:58,005 --> 00:04:00,960
Mother, do you think
we should call him "Antony"?

59
00:04:00,961 --> 00:04:06,064
"Antony" will be his full name,
his formal name, his name to the world.

60
00:04:06,101 --> 00:04:10,511
And "Tony" will be his name as a child...
and among intimates.

61
00:04:10,512 --> 00:04:12,966
When I refer to him,

62
00:04:12,967 --> 00:04:16,303
when I am asked
if I have a photograph, do I say...

63
00:04:16,304 --> 00:04:18,645
You say, "This is Tony. "

64
00:04:18,646 --> 00:04:22,173
And they will say,
"What an angel!"

65
00:04:22,174 --> 00:04:23,823
Oh, yes.

66
00:04:23,824 --> 00:04:25,587
An angel.

67
00:04:25,588 --> 00:04:27,505
What an angel.

68
00:04:27,506 --> 00:04:30,881
<i>- What an angel you are.

69
00:04:30,882 --> 00:04:34,296
- We may be out late.
- "Shall. "

70
00:04:34,297 --> 00:04:40,091
<i>Oh, yes... your mummy loves you.

71
00:04:43,964 --> 00:04:46,343
Barbara.

72
00:04:47,147 --> 00:04:50,140
Good night, Tony.
You are in good hands.

73
00:04:50,141 --> 00:04:52,211
Enjoy the Stork Club.

74
00:04:52,212 --> 00:04:55,666
And you may stay out
as late as you wish.

75
00:04:56,239 --> 00:04:58,619
Fuck!

76
00:05:18,335 --> 00:05:22,442
Mr. and Mrs. Baekeland.
Right this way, ma'am.

77
00:05:23,361 --> 00:05:25,780
She's gorgeous.

78
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,554
Hello.

79
00:05:37,555 --> 00:05:39,779
Wonderful to see you.

80
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:42,390
How do you do?

81
00:05:45,649 --> 00:05:47,298
- I'm Barbara.
- Simone.

82
00:05:47,299 --> 00:05:50,215
How do you do?

83
00:05:50,252 --> 00:05:55,891
Why, it was with Dieter that Brooks
went on his great adventure, in Peru,

84
00:05:55,892 --> 00:05:57,809
in the Villa...

85
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:02,643
<i>(sighs) Darling, you know
I'm not at my best with geography.</i>

86
00:06:02,644 --> 00:06:05,213
Brooks, help me. Villa?

87
00:06:05,214 --> 00:06:09,701
Darling, don't press. Maybe your husband
doesn't feel like in midst of dinner.

88
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:12,463
Brooks, please,
if you don't feel like performing...

89
00:06:12,464 --> 00:06:14,459
- Vilcabamba.
- Ah.

90
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:18,217
Dieter and I,
we went to the Vilcabamba in Peru.

91
00:06:18,218 --> 00:06:22,475
So tell us, man,
what was your "little adventure"?

92
00:06:22,476 --> 00:06:25,010
It was nothing.

93
00:06:25,239 --> 00:06:28,385
Well, I lie.
It was something.

94
00:06:29,114 --> 00:06:33,601
I was intrigued by a 400-year-old mystery -
what became of Manco Inca.

95
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:35,749
I wanted to find the ruins
of the lost city.

96
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:40,467
This is actually true.
Give him a dirt road and he'll go up it.

97
00:06:40,468 --> 00:06:43,423
<i>That's very good.</i>

98
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:59,839
- Would you, Simone?
- Oh, I don't know.

99
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,372
Your husband asked you a question.

100
00:07:02,373 --> 00:07:04,789
This seems... unfair.

101
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:07,513
<i>This seems...
... tedious.</i>

102
00:07:07,514 --> 00:07:10,852
<i>- Hmm... but would you?
- (husband) Yes, would you?</i>

103
00:07:11,196 --> 00:07:16,143
Would I eat a pound of human flesh
for $10 million?

104
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:18,985
No, I would not.

105
00:07:20,174 --> 00:07:22,704
<i>I have eaten horse flesh, you know.</i>

106
00:07:22,705 --> 00:07:26,655
<i>There is a difference between eating
the cheval and eating the chevalier.</i>

107
00:07:26,656 --> 00:07:31,298
Brooks, for $10 million,
would you sleep with Simone?

108
00:07:32,141 --> 00:07:35,056
- For $10 million, would you...
- Don't, Barbara.

109
00:07:35,057 --> 00:07:37,936
Please, don't be tedious.

110
00:07:39,162 --> 00:07:44,685
Would you go home with the first person
you met going through a nightclub door?

111
00:07:44,686 --> 00:07:47,449
Yes, I would.

112
00:07:47,601 --> 00:07:50,746
So... shall we get on with our drinks?

113
00:07:50,747 --> 00:07:54,160
Brooks, Barbara,
have you ever been to the Engadin?

114
00:07:54,161 --> 00:07:56,961
Oh, I was practically born in Gstaad!

115
00:07:56,962 --> 00:07:59,953
She practically loves
the ski instructors.

116
00:08:12,499 --> 00:08:14,645
<i>Thank you for coming this evening.</i>

117
00:08:14,646 --> 00:08:16,834
<i>(Barbara) Bye.</i>

118
00:08:18,099 --> 00:08:19,325
<i>(Brooks) Barbara.</i>

119
00:08:19,326 --> 00:08:21,972
You said you'd go home
with the first person you met

120
00:08:21,973 --> 00:08:23,699
- at a nightclub.
- No...

121
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:27,881
So I thought I might go home
with the first person...

122
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,032
Hello!

123
00:08:29,033 --> 00:08:32,906
Hello, I'm awfully thirsty.
Would you buy me a drink?

124
00:08:32,907 --> 00:08:35,207
Aschwin, Simone.

125
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:37,434
- Barbara!
- Brooks.

126
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,151
Lovely to see you all.

127
00:09:06,013 --> 00:09:07,699
Nini.

128
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:11,577
- Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Quite all right.

129
00:09:12,533 --> 00:09:16,409
- I must have...
- You fell asleep. Quite natural.

130
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:20,474
It's late.
It got late, you fell asleep.

131
00:09:20,475 --> 00:09:24,847
- I trust your evening was...
- Oh, we had a fine time.

132
00:09:24,848 --> 00:09:26,497
I can hold down the fort.

133
00:09:26,498 --> 00:09:29,565
- Where's Barbara?
- She's returning separately.

134
00:09:29,566 --> 00:09:32,290
- May I get your coat?
- I'll just go.

135
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:35,169
- And was the prince there?
- Excuse me?

136
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,546
The prince.
The prince of Amsterdam.

137
00:09:37,547 --> 00:09:38,927
- Ah.
- Was he there?

138
00:09:38,928 --> 00:09:42,801
I think you're thinking of Prince Bernhard,
Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands.

139
00:09:42,802 --> 00:09:46,483
He was Count Lippe-Biesterfeld, of course,
before he married Juliana.

140
00:09:46,484 --> 00:09:48,863
The man with whom we dined,
Aschwin Lippe,

141
00:09:48,864 --> 00:09:51,816
is just Aschwin Lippe,
younger brother -

142
00:09:51,817 --> 00:09:53,811
a prince in title, but not in any way...

143
00:09:53,812 --> 00:09:57,994
- Oh, because Barbara said...
- "Barbara said"!

144
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,774
Decent man, nonetheless.

145
00:10:07,775 --> 00:10:09,885
I see.

146
00:10:09,886 --> 00:10:12,531
Good man.

147
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:59,869
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

148
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:01,749
Hey, kid.

149
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:04,664
Oh, what a life.

150
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:07,695
Thirsty? Hm? Thirsty boy?

151
00:11:07,696 --> 00:11:10,689
Tony a thirsty boy?

152
00:11:11,686 --> 00:11:17,516
<i>Papa used to say, "For $2, the court fee,
and $10 for a wedding band,</i>

153
00:11:17,517 --> 00:11:21,620
<i>"I made your mummy into
'Mrs. Brooks Baekeland'...</i>

154
00:11:21,621 --> 00:11:22,810
<i>S'il vous plaît!</i>

155
00:11:22,811 --> 00:11:27,529
<i>"... and myself for the next 30 years
into 'Barbara's husband. '"</i>

156
00:11:59,446 --> 00:12:00,980
Oh!

157
00:12:00,981 --> 00:12:03,895
You are an angel.

158
00:12:03,896 --> 00:12:07,427
- Where's Papa?
- He went to visit Durán.

159
00:12:08,232 --> 00:12:10,225
What shall we do today?

160
00:12:10,226 --> 00:12:12,220
Ah. Well...

161
00:12:12,221 --> 00:12:17,553
tonight we're going to I'Hippo
with Marcel and his wife Teeny.

162
00:12:17,554 --> 00:12:20,506
<i>- You remember them.
- Ceux-Ià ne me plaisent pas.</i>

163
00:12:20,507 --> 00:12:22,386
<i>En anglais, s'il vous plaît.</i>

164
00:12:22,387 --> 00:12:25,531
- Doesn't sound like much fun for a kid.
- You don't have to come.

165
00:12:25,532 --> 00:12:27,526
- But when you leave me alone...
- Tony.

166
00:12:27,527 --> 00:12:30,134
...I feel no bigger than a lima bean.

167
00:12:30,135 --> 00:12:33,549
Oh... you won't be alone.
You'll be with Clothilde.

168
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,736
Maybe since I'll be with
boring Clothilde,

169
00:12:35,737 --> 00:12:39,189
we can balance it out with something
more fun during the day?

170
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:42,144
Ah... I see where this is going.

171
00:12:42,642 --> 00:12:45,556
- I need time to paint.
- I'd like to go on the Ferris wheel.

172
00:12:45,557 --> 00:12:48,241
- Really?
- And for lunch, I'd like some ice cream.

173
00:12:48,242 --> 00:12:49,239
Ah!

174
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,617
But you had ice cream for breakfast.

175
00:12:55,071 --> 00:12:57,755
<i>- Please don't tell Papa.</i>

176
00:12:57,756 --> 00:13:01,055
I won't.
It will be our secret.

177
00:13:01,056 --> 00:13:03,356
As will the aspirins
you're going to fetch...

178
00:13:03,357 --> 00:13:06,657
From the bathroom,
next to the sink.

179
00:13:07,884 --> 00:13:11,491
Your mother
has a shocking hangover.

180
00:13:14,098 --> 00:13:16,517
Mummy...

181
00:13:17,244 --> 00:13:19,969
I shall cure you.

182
00:13:29,865 --> 00:13:32,283
- Ha!
- Oh!

183
00:13:42,909 --> 00:13:44,827
Ha!

184
00:13:45,516 --> 00:13:47,741
OK! OK, OK.

185
00:13:47,742 --> 00:13:49,813
I concede, I resign.

186
00:13:49,814 --> 00:13:51,883
Well, sir, I'm pretty expert.

187
00:13:51,884 --> 00:13:56,105
So there's no embarrassment
in losing, if that's a concern.

188
00:13:58,675 --> 00:14:01,474
- Do you love me?
- Of course.

189
00:14:01,475 --> 00:14:05,464
Will you still love me when my hair is gray
and my tits are sagging?

190
00:14:05,465 --> 00:14:07,998
Well, of course.

191
00:14:09,761 --> 00:14:12,713
- Do you remember the dog?
- What dog?

192
00:14:12,714 --> 00:14:16,551
- Which dog?
- The one we had in Italy.

193
00:14:16,552 --> 00:14:18,969
Giotto.

194
00:14:19,505 --> 00:14:21,576
I remember when Giotto died.

195
00:14:21,577 --> 00:14:23,570
- He was old.
- No, he wasn't.

196
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:25,834
In dog years.

197
00:14:25,835 --> 00:14:28,595
- We still have his collar.
- I know.

198
00:14:28,596 --> 00:14:31,627
- Somewhere.
- I know where.

199
00:14:31,628 --> 00:14:36,000
Leo was famous.
Not like you're famous, of course.

200
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:37,957
Well, I'm not...

201
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:40,181
For heaven's sake.
You won the Premio Nadal.

202
00:14:40,182 --> 00:14:43,901
You know Picasso, you know Camus,
you know Malraux, you know Dali.

203
00:14:43,902 --> 00:14:46,626
Pilar knows them.
I just write.

204
00:14:46,627 --> 00:14:50,385
What I'm saying, Carlos,
is that Leo's fame, like yours,

205
00:14:50,386 --> 00:14:53,915
was a function of achievement,
came from what he did.

206
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:55,909
So Leo's stroke of genius

207
00:14:55,910 --> 00:15:00,704
was the notion that the formaldehyde
might stabilize the phenol, give it strength.

208
00:15:00,705 --> 00:15:04,580
But they never mixed. Leo thought,
"Let's try putting it under pressure. "

209
00:15:04,581 --> 00:15:09,185
Poof! Long chain molecules,
Bakelite, plastic.

210
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:12,405
The telephone, bracelets,
radios, records,

211
00:15:12,406 --> 00:15:16,049
coffins, submarines,
the housing for the atom bomb -

212
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:18,849
the world as we know it today.

213
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:22,648
- That was your father?
- No, that was my grandfather.

214
00:15:22,649 --> 00:15:27,138
<i>My father is a crapule.
My grandfather decidedly was not.</i>

215
00:15:28,096 --> 00:15:30,857
- What does Papa do?
- How do you mean?

216
00:15:30,858 --> 00:15:34,501
<i>- Well, François at the...
- At the école?</i>

217
00:15:34,502 --> 00:15:40,793
- François asked me...
- You can tell him, "My father writes.

218
00:15:40,794 --> 00:15:43,094
"My father explores.

219
00:15:43,095 --> 00:15:47,315
"My father has
a very refined knowledge of mathematics. "

220
00:15:47,316 --> 00:15:48,426
Oh.

221
00:15:48,427 --> 00:15:52,916
And you can tell him that your mother
was almost a movie star.

222
00:15:55,678 --> 00:15:58,516
Do you find my wife attractive?

223
00:15:58,517 --> 00:16:01,163
Most men do.

224
00:16:01,164 --> 00:16:03,311
But what she doesn't...

225
00:16:03,312 --> 00:16:06,152
what Barbara doesn't realize...

226
00:16:06,611 --> 00:16:09,220
is that women find me...

227
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:13,669
you know...

228
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:16,088
attractive.

229
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:20,305
Some people's fathers,
some people's mothers,

230
00:16:20,306 --> 00:16:25,100
they have to go to an office or a factory
or a store, I guess, every day.

231
00:16:25,101 --> 00:16:27,520
But we are fortunate...

232
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:32,274
because what we do
is what we love.

233
00:16:32,275 --> 00:16:35,346
What does François' father do?

234
00:16:35,881 --> 00:16:38,565
- He works.
- Ah, well, we worked.

235
00:16:38,566 --> 00:16:42,939
I mean, Father worked, Nini worked.
There was no other way.

236
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:47,657
I kind of had to raise myself,
and then I worked, too - at Filene's.

237
00:16:47,658 --> 00:16:50,573
Then when I could, I left.

238
00:16:50,574 --> 00:16:53,298
I just left.

239
00:16:53,527 --> 00:16:57,822
Nini wanted what was best for me -
only what was best for me.

240
00:16:57,823 --> 00:16:59,703
"Find the mon," she'd say.

241
00:16:59,704 --> 00:17:05,421
She meant "man," I guess,
and she meant "money. "

242
00:17:06,648 --> 00:17:09,638
The rich, they don't have
pet names for money.

243
00:17:09,639 --> 00:17:12,401
Did you know Leonardo da Vinci
wrote backwards?

244
00:17:12,402 --> 00:17:15,011
So you could only read it in a mirror.

245
00:17:36,493 --> 00:17:37,912
<i>- Entrez.
- Hi.</i>

246
00:17:37,913 --> 00:17:40,330
Carlos!

247
00:17:40,751 --> 00:17:44,049
Pilar!
My, you're looking swell!

248
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:45,122
<i>Gracias.</i>

249
00:17:45,123 --> 00:17:49,267
Mrs. Baekeland, permit me
to introduce Monsieur Souvestre.

250
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:52,757
Jean-Pierre,
I am so happy to meet you.

251
00:17:52,758 --> 00:17:55,177
Please, come in.

252
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,315
I have been dying to ask you
about Marcel Proust,

253
00:18:00,316 --> 00:18:02,769
your biography of whom
I have yet to read

254
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:06,644
as my French reading skills
are not what they will be.

255
00:18:06,645 --> 00:18:09,100
It is not necessary
to apologize for that.

256
00:18:09,101 --> 00:18:11,325
Brooks reads the language
like a native.

257
00:18:11,326 --> 00:18:14,662
<i>And our Tony is mastering it every day
at the école bilingue.</i>

258
00:18:14,663 --> 00:18:18,497
<i>But for poor moi, I must confess,
it's been a struggle, n'est-ce pas?</i>

259
00:18:18,498 --> 00:18:20,224
Understood.

260
00:18:20,225 --> 00:18:23,639
What was I saying?
Oh... yes.

261
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:27,283
Jean-Pierre,
was Proust truly a homosexual?

262
00:18:27,284 --> 00:18:29,970
<i>Qu'est-ce que tu penses?</i>

263
00:18:33,077 --> 00:18:35,991
So you met Carlos here in Paris?

264
00:18:35,992 --> 00:18:41,017
I was at the Sorbonne, the adoring
graduate student writing about his work.

265
00:18:41,018 --> 00:18:46,809
But then... we woke up one morning
and none of that seemed to matter.

266
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:48,804
I think I knew he was serious

267
00:18:48,805 --> 00:18:53,138
when he introduced me
to Marcel and Teeny Duchamp.

268
00:18:53,139 --> 00:18:56,208
Oh! I ran into them today,
at I'Équipe.

269
00:18:56,209 --> 00:18:59,124
They said they might
stop over... later.

270
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:00,734
<i>Je peux lui telephoner?</i>

271
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:04,420
You may be assured
they were only being polite.

272
00:19:07,256 --> 00:19:11,783
I don't want to be impolite, but
M. Souvestre has the early day tomorrow.

273
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:13,624
He's off to Vittel.

274
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:18,189
It is regrettable,
but what Mrs. Durán says is the truth.

275
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:22,485
<i>Un petit café for the road?
And you've yet to meet Tony.</i>

276
00:19:22,486 --> 00:19:24,902
<i>Excusez-moi.</i>

277
00:19:31,846 --> 00:19:37,408
<i>Monsieur Souvestre, permettez-moi
de vous présenter mon fils, Tony.</i>

278
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:39,786
Did I get it right?
Did I get the order right?

279
00:19:39,787 --> 00:19:43,200
The younger is presented to the older,
the less distinguished to the more so.

280
00:19:43,201 --> 00:19:46,002
a gentleman
is always presented to a lady.

281
00:19:46,003 --> 00:19:51,948
unless the man
is a president, a cardinal or a sovereign.

282
00:19:51,949 --> 00:19:54,172
So, then, it's right.

283
00:19:54,173 --> 00:19:56,704
Well, everyone, this is Tony.

284
00:19:56,705 --> 00:19:58,545
Say hello.

285
00:19:58,546 --> 00:20:00,655
<i>Buenas noches,
señor y señora Durán.</i>

286
00:20:00,656 --> 00:20:02,306
<i>Buenas noches.</i>

287
00:20:02,307 --> 00:20:05,719
<i>Bonsoir, M. Souvestre.
Enchanté de faire votre connaissance.</i>

288
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,865
<i>- (Jean-Pierre) Bonsoir.
- Told you his French is better than mine.</i>

289
00:20:08,866 --> 00:20:11,936
Perhaps you'd like to read something.

290
00:20:12,472 --> 00:20:15,386
Perhaps Tony would prefer
to get his sleep.

291
00:20:15,387 --> 00:20:18,072
Especially as M. Souvestre
has an early start.

292
00:20:18,073 --> 00:20:19,799
<i>(Barbara whispers) Please.</i>

293
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,987
For me.

294
00:20:40,591 --> 00:20:43,889
Thank you, Tony.
It was gracious of you to volunteer.

295
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:45,692
You are welcome, señora.

296
00:20:45,693 --> 00:20:48,070
Your mother's a bit tired, as are we.

297
00:20:48,071 --> 00:20:50,487
As, I'm sure, are you.

298
00:20:50,488 --> 00:20:52,866
- Um...
- Then we call it an evening.

299
00:20:52,867 --> 00:20:55,475
As your friend,
Monsieur Duchamp, says...

300
00:20:57,815 --> 00:21:00,231
Your husband or your son
will translate.

301
00:21:00,232 --> 00:21:02,149
Don't you dare.

302
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:05,371
Don't you dare condescend to me.
Fucking French!

303
00:21:05,372 --> 00:21:08,786
They tell you how to raise your child,
and then they stare at your ass.

304
00:21:08,787 --> 00:21:11,356
<i>Yes, cul -
I know the word!</i>

305
00:21:11,357 --> 00:21:15,115
It's sick.
This society is sick!

306
00:21:15,116 --> 00:21:16,573
Excuse me.

307
00:21:16,574 --> 00:21:19,030
"Move-ez"!

308
00:21:27,776 --> 00:21:31,918
I shall be leaving too.
Tell Tony his father says good night.

309
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,529
<i>Un momento, por favor.</i>

310
00:21:36,982 --> 00:21:39,593
<i>Vos clés.</i>

311
00:22:12,467 --> 00:22:15,653
What are you doing
in my hotel room?

312
00:22:21,368 --> 00:22:24,128
You bribed the concierge,
didn't you?

313
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,232
<i>(Barbara) Hello?</i>

314
00:24:12,233 --> 00:24:14,651
Hello?

315
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,318
<i>(Tony) Mummy?</i>

316
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,771
Mummy?

317
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:46,951
<i>- Bonjour, Maman.
- Bonjour.</i>

318
00:24:53,203 --> 00:24:55,043
Who's that boy?

319
00:24:55,044 --> 00:24:57,192
François.

320
00:24:57,193 --> 00:24:59,956
<i>From the école?</i>

321
00:24:59,994 --> 00:25:02,948
<i>From the école bilingue?</i>

322
00:25:03,254 --> 00:25:05,634
I know where he's from.

323
00:25:07,781 --> 00:25:11,846
When you left, and then when Mummy left,
I didn't want to be alone,

324
00:25:11,847 --> 00:25:14,838
so I called François,
and he came over.

325
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:17,332
We listened to the radio.
It was Boulez -

326
00:25:17,333 --> 00:25:20,784
one of those poems by René Char,
which Boulez set to music.

327
00:25:20,785 --> 00:25:22,894
I rather like Boulez,
don't you, Mummy?

328
00:25:22,895 --> 00:25:25,502
I know that some consider him
atonal and all that,

329
00:25:25,503 --> 00:25:30,297
but I think they just don't know
how to listen, or what to listen for.

330
00:25:30,298 --> 00:25:32,870
Your friend leaves.

331
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,783
Now.

332
00:25:40,082 --> 00:25:42,461
Get him a towel.

333
00:26:39,004 --> 00:26:40,884
That wasn't bad, you know.

334
00:26:40,885 --> 00:26:42,380
Tony?

335
00:26:42,381 --> 00:26:45,029
Do you have a cigarette for me?

336
00:26:46,562 --> 00:26:48,518
Black.

337
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:50,704
I like black tobacco.

338
00:26:50,705 --> 00:26:53,545
But sometimes I yearn for the brown.

339
00:27:24,118 --> 00:27:26,227
- You know how they are.
- What?

340
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:29,757
- Fussing, always making a fuss.
- Not all women.

341
00:27:29,758 --> 00:27:32,291
Damn near all.

342
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:35,168
Always telling us, you know.

343
00:27:35,857 --> 00:27:39,078
Always telling us
where to put our cocks,

344
00:27:39,079 --> 00:27:41,536
where not to...

345
00:27:42,263 --> 00:27:44,563
and so forth.

346
00:27:44,564 --> 00:27:48,327
I don't need to tell you.
You've seen, you know.

347
00:27:48,516 --> 00:27:51,433
So what are you saying?

348
00:27:52,391 --> 00:27:55,650
You'll soon be...
Hell, you're on your own.

349
00:27:55,651 --> 00:28:00,870
I just wanted to give you a piece of...
what fathers tell sons.

350
00:28:03,248 --> 00:28:04,934
Well, thanks.

351
00:28:04,935 --> 00:28:08,082
I mean, your mother was an actress.

352
00:28:08,542 --> 00:28:11,801
<i>In some ways, is an actress.
Will mostly likely be...</i>

353
00:28:11,802 --> 00:28:14,448
Mummy can be histrionic,
but she's not...

354
00:28:14,449 --> 00:28:17,363
Don't defend her.
You needn't defend her.

355
00:28:17,364 --> 00:28:19,666
You love her, as do I,
but for the moment,

356
00:28:19,667 --> 00:28:23,082
we're sitting here,
Brooks and Antony, two men.

357
00:28:27,722 --> 00:28:31,636
Had she been on time,
we'd never have had this discussion.

358
00:28:42,683 --> 00:28:45,790
Do you think she gets stoned?

359
00:28:45,791 --> 00:28:48,553
Well, she's Spanish.

360
00:28:49,012 --> 00:28:51,431
Worth a pull?

361
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:55,114
After you, pal.

362
00:28:59,025 --> 00:29:01,710
<i>¿Te gustaría fumar?</i>

363
00:29:01,711 --> 00:29:03,934
<i>Sí.</i>

364
00:29:03,935 --> 00:29:06,353
<i>Gracias.</i>

365
00:29:14,178 --> 00:29:16,673
Taught by experts.

366
00:29:18,859 --> 00:29:21,736
You know what this place needs?

367
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:26,070
Some music.

368
00:29:26,071 --> 00:29:28,873
- I have one.
- Excuse me?

369
00:29:48,167 --> 00:29:52,848
<i>♪ Once upon a time

380
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,532
<i>- (Tony) I don't know.
- (Barbara) What's she like?</i>

381
00:30:39,533 --> 00:30:43,752
- I don't know. She's Spanish.
- Well, with a name like Blanca...

382
00:30:43,753 --> 00:30:46,552
- Blanca what?
- I don't know Blanca what.

383
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:49,776
This is not a city, it's a port,
so when we hang out,

384
00:30:49,777 --> 00:30:52,844
it's typically on a first-name basis.

385
00:30:52,845 --> 00:30:57,831
<i>And if what you're asking is,
"Does she come from bonne famille?"...</i>

386
00:30:57,832 --> 00:31:01,052
You know,
if that's what you're asking, well...

387
00:31:01,053 --> 00:31:03,955
<i>aren't there enough
counts and countesses</i>

388
00:31:03,956 --> 00:31:06,731
in that stack of cartes de visite
in the foyer,

389
00:31:06,732 --> 00:31:08,994
just the way that Nini taught you?

390
00:31:08,995 --> 00:31:14,019
<i>The carte from Prince Bernhard is
always on top, and the bills on the bottom.</i>

391
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:17,586
You will not
speak to your mother like that.

392
00:31:17,587 --> 00:31:19,620
I will not stand for it.

393
00:31:19,621 --> 00:31:21,848
Oh, piss off.

394
00:31:30,132 --> 00:31:32,433
A mother knows.

395
00:31:32,434 --> 00:31:33,775
Hm?

396
00:31:33,776 --> 00:31:39,225
When her son...
when her son might like someone.

397
00:32:34,964 --> 00:32:37,379
<i>(Brooks) The discovery, that was 1907.</i>

398
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:41,062
In less than ten years
my grandfather was a very wealthy man.

399
00:32:41,063 --> 00:32:44,477
<i>1924, his face on the cover
of Time magazine.</i>

400
00:32:44,478 --> 00:32:49,272
1930, Coco Chanel makes all her
mannequins wear Bakelite accessories.

401
00:32:49,273 --> 00:32:52,800
Then came the Depression,
which hit everyone except the Baekelands.

402
00:32:52,801 --> 00:32:55,716
We were headed the other direction.

403
00:32:55,717 --> 00:32:59,092
Our triumph -
and, of course, our downfall.

404
00:32:59,093 --> 00:33:01,586
How do you mean?

405
00:33:01,587 --> 00:33:04,233
Leo knew the social register,

406
00:33:04,234 --> 00:33:07,532
but it wasn't what moved him,
it wasn't what he prized.

407
00:33:07,533 --> 00:33:09,948
<i>To him, all that was just la parade.</i>

408
00:33:09,949 --> 00:33:12,864
But not to George -
his son, my father.

409
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:17,813
He valued all that to a fault,
and in the process lost everything.

410
00:33:17,814 --> 00:33:20,920
<i>Camarero!
No one here is drinking enough.</i>

411
00:33:20,921 --> 00:33:23,721
Another round over here.

412
00:33:23,722 --> 00:33:29,400
<i>(softly) Tony, let's drink while your father
bores the shit out of your little friend.</i>

413
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:36,648
<i>- (Blanca) She's not very happy.
- Ah!</i>

414
00:33:36,649 --> 00:33:39,720
Then you understand.

415
00:33:47,045 --> 00:33:49,732
Well, it's been a long night.

416
00:33:51,343 --> 00:33:53,029
Bye, kiddo.

417
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:55,832
- Night, Blanca.
- Good night.

418
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:08,376
- Are you sure that?
- Yes!

419
00:34:40,714 --> 00:34:46,313
You know, I don't think
I've ever met a family like yours.

420
00:34:46,314 --> 00:34:51,031
All this excitement,
all this history.

421
00:34:51,032 --> 00:34:54,602
<i>- Well, there is that.
- (chuckles) Yes.</i>

422
00:36:07,872 --> 00:36:11,056
You really are
such a handsome boy.

423
00:36:21,797 --> 00:36:24,175
<i>Later, Mummy said
that I had brought Blanca home</i>

424
00:36:24,176 --> 00:36:28,279
<i>like a kitten
that had killed its first mouse...</i>

425
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:31,005
<i>and laid it at your feet.</i>

426
00:36:31,808 --> 00:36:36,453
<i>And you... and you took it.</i>

427
00:37:02,767 --> 00:37:07,755
<i>Por favor. ¿Adónde hora
esta la aeroplane de Nice?</i>

428
00:37:08,445 --> 00:37:11,283
- Landing? When it lands?
- Oh, it's been delayed.

429
00:37:11,284 --> 00:37:14,239
So, 6p. m.
Anytime after that.

430
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:35,221
<i>(woman over PA) Paging Mr. Baekeland -
to the Aviaco counter, please.</i>

431
00:37:35,222 --> 00:37:37,790
Paging, please, Mr. Baekeland -
to Aviaco.

432
00:37:37,791 --> 00:37:40,516
Your party is waiting.

433
00:37:44,313 --> 00:37:46,999
Boarding time's at 1:30, no?

434
00:37:47,689 --> 00:37:50,107
Let me see.

435
00:37:53,481 --> 00:37:56,206
Yeah, it's 1:30.

436
00:38:00,042 --> 00:38:02,613
Come, darling.

437
00:38:02,957 --> 00:38:05,375
Coward!

438
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:08,827
<i>¡Cobarde!</i>

439
00:38:09,094 --> 00:38:10,743
<i>¡Cobarde!</i>

440
00:38:10,744 --> 00:38:13,965
<i>That's right, that's you
I'm talking about you, little puta.</i>

441
00:38:13,966 --> 00:38:15,768
You little whore!

442
00:38:15,769 --> 00:38:20,526
<i>- Aún no estamos embarcando.
- Señor, por favor.</i>

443
00:38:20,527 --> 00:38:22,828
You are truly disgusting,
do you know that?

444
00:38:22,829 --> 00:38:24,822
You and your little Spanish cunt.

445
00:38:24,823 --> 00:38:28,735
<i>- (whispers) You're speaking too loudly.
- I am speaking of a cunt, half your age.</i>

446
00:38:28,736 --> 00:38:32,380
She looked at Tony, looked at you,
thought for about five seconds,

447
00:38:32,381 --> 00:38:35,640
and said to herself,
"Ha! That's where the money is. "

448
00:38:35,641 --> 00:38:37,136
<i>¿Entiendes?</i>

449
00:38:37,137 --> 00:38:40,281
You go on about your grandfather
and the life of the fucking mind.

450
00:38:40,282 --> 00:38:43,197
<i>I go away for one week,
and what do you do? (sniffing)</i>

451
00:38:43,198 --> 00:38:47,150
Something very intellectual.
Very intellectual indeed.

452
00:38:47,187 --> 00:38:50,793
<i>Oh, does he fuck you up the ass?
¿Por el culo?</i>

453
00:38:50,794 --> 00:38:53,402
That's what he likes, you know.

454
00:38:53,403 --> 00:38:55,435
He thinks it's very manly.

455
00:38:55,436 --> 00:38:59,578
I think... quite the opposite.

456
00:39:02,801 --> 00:39:05,334
"Oh, Brooks, you...

457
00:39:06,906 --> 00:39:08,785
"you big man, you. "

458
00:39:08,786 --> 00:39:13,735
And you honor the great
Baekeland tradition by fucking her.

459
00:39:14,693 --> 00:39:17,530
<i>(softly) OK... fuck her.</i>

460
00:39:17,531 --> 00:39:21,290
Fuck her. I understand.

461
00:39:21,291 --> 00:39:23,707
But leave me?

462
00:39:23,708 --> 00:39:26,738
Break my heart?
Break Tony's?

463
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:30,193
He never broke Tony's heart.

464
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:33,297
And neither did I.

465
00:39:33,298 --> 00:39:37,287
Much of what you've just said
is an amalgam of paranoia and spite.

466
00:39:37,288 --> 00:39:41,853
Sell yourself to yourself any way you like,
but in your heart, you know.

467
00:39:41,854 --> 00:39:44,422
So does everyone else.

468
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:46,842
Also...

469
00:39:47,378 --> 00:39:50,754
you're a little old for this,
don't you think?

470
00:40:16,033 --> 00:40:18,452
<i>¿No lleva equipaje?</i>

471
00:40:25,701 --> 00:40:28,118
<i>No tengo.</i>

472
00:41:23,666 --> 00:41:26,390
You are a very nice man.

473
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:32,566
<i>Un... hombre... encantador.</i>

474
00:42:22,359 --> 00:42:26,693
<i>Jake was like a devil...
or a magician.</i>

475
00:42:26,694 --> 00:42:30,531
Nothing is true.
Everything is permitted.

476
00:42:31,834 --> 00:42:38,127
<i>He wore little bones and things
on his vest - these certain little bones.</i>

477
00:42:42,423 --> 00:42:44,608
<i>(Barbara) Tony! Jake!</i>

478
00:42:44,609 --> 00:42:48,444
- You might have knocked.
- I did.

479
00:42:52,127 --> 00:42:54,927
I went to the airport today,
to pick up Sam.

480
00:42:54,928 --> 00:42:57,996
Who should I see but your father?

481
00:42:57,997 --> 00:43:01,412
We had a word or two,
I can tell you that.

482
00:43:02,102 --> 00:43:04,326
<i>You can tell me,
you are telling me.</i>

483
00:43:04,327 --> 00:43:07,087
- Don't get harsh with me.
- I'm sorry.

484
00:43:07,088 --> 00:43:10,847
Are you defending him?
Are you taking his side?

485
00:43:10,848 --> 00:43:12,841
You must have had a long drive.

486
00:43:12,842 --> 00:43:16,298
Sit down and let me pour you
something to drink, OK?

487
00:43:33,942 --> 00:43:37,665
So I told Sam
you'd be joining us for dinner.

488
00:43:38,201 --> 00:43:40,695
I'll see you around nine.

489
00:43:43,341 --> 00:43:46,372
How can you live in this shithole?

490
00:44:06,972 --> 00:44:10,692
<i>Sam was often called a walker-</i>

491
00:44:10,693 --> 00:44:14,374
<i>one of those homosexuals who escort
wealthy women to dinner or to the opera</i>

492
00:44:14,375 --> 00:44:16,675
<i>when their husbands are not able.</i>

493
00:44:16,676 --> 00:44:20,474
<i>But Sam's devotion to Barbara
was never about the money.</i>

494
00:44:20,475 --> 00:44:23,159
<i>In fact, he liked us more
when there was less of it.</i>

495
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:26,114
Do you remember how it was
with Maxime de la Falaise?

496
00:44:26,115 --> 00:44:28,645
There was a difficult period.

497
00:44:28,646 --> 00:44:32,365
I helped her, as much as I could -
a few of us, we did what we could -

498
00:44:32,366 --> 00:44:35,283
and now, well...

499
00:44:35,743 --> 00:44:39,158
no one remembers
the sad period now, do they?

500
00:44:41,229 --> 00:44:44,260
These are the facts we have to face.

501
00:44:44,758 --> 00:44:48,938
One - we are dealing with
an insecure and capricious crowd

502
00:44:48,939 --> 00:44:53,966
who, given any doubt or hesitation,
will always follow the money.

503
00:44:54,425 --> 00:44:57,227
In this case, meaning Brooks.

504
00:45:00,409 --> 00:45:04,630
Second, and this is in your favor...

505
00:45:05,166 --> 00:45:07,774
you were,
to any sensible observer,

506
00:45:07,775 --> 00:45:11,342
the charm and vivacity of the couple.

507
00:45:11,343 --> 00:45:14,334
So, we must make that work
to your benefit.

508
00:45:14,335 --> 00:45:18,208
- I'm so glad you're here.
- It's my pleasure.

509
00:45:18,209 --> 00:45:20,970
Pop across to Cadaqués
for a day or two.

510
00:45:20,971 --> 00:45:25,190
<i>You need to be proud, not embarrassed,
to be seen in public.</i>

511
00:45:25,191 --> 00:45:28,912
<i>And that will give people permission
to be seen with you.</i>

512
00:45:28,913 --> 00:45:30,331
<i>Hola. Un café...</i>

513
00:45:30,332 --> 00:45:34,858
Let us think
who are those, you know,

514
00:45:34,859 --> 00:45:38,041
from whom others take their cue?

515
00:45:38,042 --> 00:45:41,341
Someone like Pilar Durán
would be terrific.

516
00:45:41,342 --> 00:45:45,791
<i>And then, of course,
we need a doyenne to seal it.</i>

517
00:45:45,792 --> 00:45:48,706
<i>You do, of course,
know Teeny Duchamp?</i>

518
00:45:48,707 --> 00:45:50,701
<i>Teeny Matisse Duchamp?</i>

519
00:45:50,702 --> 00:45:55,575
And I shall, naturally,
make sure that the word gets out.

520
00:45:55,804 --> 00:45:59,602
<i>As will others.
 As will others!</i>

521
00:46:02,825 --> 00:46:04,856
You've got to start painting again.

522
00:46:04,857 --> 00:46:08,884
- The difference between...
- An artist and a divorcée.

523
00:46:08,885 --> 00:46:11,495
So you understand.

524
00:46:11,992 --> 00:46:13,832
That's for starters.

525
00:46:13,833 --> 00:46:16,826
Some of it will, I've no doubt,
be emotionally unpleasant.

526
00:46:16,827 --> 00:46:19,127
<i>Oh, please.
Where is he?</i>

527
00:46:19,128 --> 00:46:21,774
Oh, I'm sure he'll be along, Barbara.

528
00:46:21,775 --> 00:46:25,190
He's just... being Tony.

529
00:46:30,175 --> 00:46:33,128
Mummy,
what I don't understand is Brooks.

530
00:46:33,129 --> 00:46:36,697
Of all the places
Brooks would want to go for the season,

531
00:46:36,698 --> 00:46:40,073
why choose a place right near us,
and then not want to see us?

532
00:46:40,074 --> 00:46:43,180
Why would Blanca want to go to Mallorca
when she hates me so much?

533
00:46:43,181 --> 00:46:45,675
She doesn't hate you.

534
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:50,162
- And Brooks?
- He doesn't hate you either.

535
00:46:50,163 --> 00:46:55,650
- Then why won't he...
- I've given up trying to understand him...

536
00:46:56,109 --> 00:46:58,716
explain him, justify his ways.

537
00:46:58,717 --> 00:47:02,206
Men do...
This is something you know very well.

538
00:47:02,207 --> 00:47:04,894
Men do what... what men do.

539
00:47:05,353 --> 00:47:07,772
Mummy?

540
00:47:08,615 --> 00:47:11,568
I think he's writing us a letter.

541
00:47:11,569 --> 00:47:14,790
I think he is writing us a letter,

542
00:47:14,791 --> 00:47:18,357
but in another alphabet,
in Baekeland writing...

543
00:47:18,358 --> 00:47:20,083
no one else can read.

544
00:47:20,084 --> 00:47:23,421
- 'Cause the thing with Brooks is, he...
- Oh, please.

545
00:47:23,422 --> 00:47:25,840
Mummy, don't be angry.

546
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:28,717
I'm not angry.

547
00:47:30,596 --> 00:47:33,014
I love you.

548
00:47:33,435 --> 00:47:35,852
Mummy, I love you.

549
00:47:56,337 --> 00:47:58,331
- You've been fantastic.
- You needn't...

550
00:47:58,332 --> 00:48:01,207
I wanted to, really.

551
00:48:01,208 --> 00:48:03,816
I can't begin to tell you
how much of an improvement...

552
00:48:03,817 --> 00:48:06,769
Well, she'll be all right.

553
00:48:06,770 --> 00:48:09,417
Well, she'll always be Barbara.

554
00:48:09,418 --> 00:48:11,756
<i>(chuckles) Yeah.</i>

555
00:48:11,757 --> 00:48:14,942
And... what of you?

556
00:48:14,943 --> 00:48:17,972
What of life in the world
of Tony Baekeland?

557
00:48:17,973 --> 00:48:20,391
<i>Ça va.</i>

558
00:48:21,731 --> 00:48:23,802
<i>"Ça va"?</i>

559
00:48:23,803 --> 00:48:25,337
<i>"Pas mal"?</i>

560
00:48:25,338 --> 00:48:27,600
No, no, no, no!

561
00:48:27,601 --> 00:48:29,864
That isn't good enough by half.

562
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:32,434
Tony takes care of Jake.

563
00:48:32,435 --> 00:48:34,774
Tony takes care of Barbara.

564
00:48:34,775 --> 00:48:37,500
Someone must take care of Tony.

565
00:49:50,271 --> 00:49:54,106
What I would like to do, ideally,
is to place you with a gallery.

566
00:49:54,107 --> 00:49:57,291
Or, failing that,
with a private dealer -

567
00:49:57,292 --> 00:50:00,707
and that is something
I know I can do.

568
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:11,141
You shouldn't have done that.

569
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:15,207
Sam...

570
00:50:15,666 --> 00:50:18,967
you should not have done that.

571
00:50:22,073 --> 00:50:25,332
He's your child,
and he will always be your child,

572
00:50:25,333 --> 00:50:29,246
but he is a grown man
with his own life and his own choices.

573
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:31,279
You don't know
what you're talking about.

574
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:35,613
<i>- Tony is who Tony is.

575
00:50:35,614 --> 00:50:38,953
<i>Tony is not who Tony is!</i>

576
00:51:19,616 --> 00:51:22,300
<i>Dear Papa,</i>

577
00:51:22,301 --> 00:51:27,021
<i>I don't know any other way to say this
but straight out.</i>

578
00:51:27,326 --> 00:51:29,818
<i>Would you please
come back to Mummy?</i>

579
00:51:29,819 --> 00:51:32,852
<i>She's so unhappy.</i>

580
00:51:33,388 --> 00:51:35,997
<i>She needs you...</i>

581
00:51:36,341 --> 00:51:39,182
<i>but is too full of pride to ask.</i>

582
00:51:41,405 --> 00:51:45,661
<i>Do you remember our dog
whom you named Giotto?</i>

583
00:51:45,662 --> 00:51:49,693
<i>The dog is gone,
but the collar remains.</i>

584
00:51:50,151 --> 00:51:53,795
<i>For all the times we've moved,
I've taken it from place to place.</i>

585
00:51:53,796 --> 00:51:57,249
<i>It's never gotten lost,
not even once.</i>

586
00:52:01,199 --> 00:52:04,116
<i>I do not know why you fear me.</i>

587
00:52:05,113 --> 00:52:07,876
<i>I do not fear you.</i>

588
00:52:09,026 --> 00:52:13,398
<i>Sometimes I have a bloody mind
and I don't know what to do about it,</i>

589
00:52:13,399 --> 00:52:17,657
<i>but I fight it with everything I've got.</i>

590
00:52:18,308 --> 00:52:21,533
<i>With my best love, Antony.</i>

591
00:52:53,909 --> 00:52:55,980
Tony!

592
00:52:55,981 --> 00:52:58,054
Tony!

593
00:53:23,716 --> 00:53:25,980
Brooks!

594
00:54:10,287 --> 00:54:14,507
<i>Everything is going to be all right.</i>

595
00:55:04,530 --> 00:55:08,097
<i>My mummy told me,
ever since I was seven:</i>

596
00:55:08,098 --> 00:55:10,823
<i>"Hold your head up high. "</i>

597
00:55:18,378 --> 00:55:22,638
<i>A very strange thing
is when your charm ceases...</i>

598
00:55:24,095 --> 00:55:28,470
<i>and, for one reason or another,
you become gloomy.</i>

599
00:55:32,765 --> 00:55:38,904
<i>And people cease to understand you
when you need understanding the most.</i>

600
00:55:47,994 --> 00:55:51,637
<i>I now realize that,
for many years,</i>

601
00:55:51,638 --> 00:55:53,978
<i>I have been living a totally false life.</i>

602
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:04,221
<i>Anyway...</i>

603
00:56:04,222 --> 00:56:09,440
<i>for Mummy's sake, I've decided
to make a new person of myself.</i>

604
00:58:31,454 --> 00:58:34,563
We'll be bored rigid without you.

605
00:58:35,367 --> 00:58:39,662
- It's harder to get people to come...
- Than it was in Cadaqués? I know.

606
00:58:39,663 --> 00:58:42,081
I know.

607
00:58:42,886 --> 00:58:45,304
It's time.

608
00:58:48,909 --> 00:58:51,327
It's time.

609
00:59:15,531 --> 00:59:17,950
I'm glad he's gone.

610
00:59:27,999 --> 00:59:30,683
<i>I'm not sure, Papa,
you would want to know this,</i>

611
00:59:30,684 --> 00:59:34,558
<i>but she used sleeping suppositories,
six or seven of them,</i>

612
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:37,860
<i>so that she wouldn't
change her mind - couldn't.</i>

613
00:59:38,319 --> 00:59:42,652
<i>I remember she told me that her father,
my grandfather, had killed himself,</i>

614
00:59:42,653 --> 00:59:47,986
<i>so I fear that...
all this ran very deep within her.</i>

615
00:59:49,099 --> 00:59:51,284
<i>It was a miracle,
that I came home that night</i>

616
00:59:51,285 --> 00:59:55,733
<i>instead of staying out till morning,
as is my custom.</i>

617
00:59:55,734 --> 01:00:00,378
<i>And a miracle that when I did come home
she was still alive.</i>

618
01:00:01,488 --> 01:00:05,480
<i>Taking care of Mummy
had been your job.</i>

619
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:09,966
<i>But when you left, Brooks,</i>

620
01:00:09,967 --> 01:00:13,881
<i>taking care of Mummy
became my inheritance.</i>

621
01:00:15,836 --> 01:00:17,832
Barbara?

622
01:01:10,961 --> 01:01:12,726
Hi.

623
01:01:12,727 --> 01:01:14,836
We just missed each other.

624
01:01:14,837 --> 01:01:17,406
<i>À I'hôpital?</i>

625
01:01:17,407 --> 01:01:19,631
They told me
that you had been there.

626
01:01:19,632 --> 01:01:23,661
This... must be very hard for you.

627
01:01:27,687 --> 01:01:30,258
Your music? Your writing?

628
01:01:30,259 --> 01:01:31,716
That!

629
01:01:31,717 --> 01:01:34,861
Carlos thinks very highly of you -
always has.

630
01:01:34,862 --> 01:01:38,660
- And I'm sure he'll...
- Have you seen Brooks?

631
01:01:39,158 --> 01:01:41,806
Carlos saw him.

632
01:01:44,605 --> 01:01:49,632
I don't think that Brooks
is liking me very much these days.

633
01:01:51,434 --> 01:01:54,578
<i>- He said I was a crapule.
- Oh, please!</i>

634
01:01:54,579 --> 01:01:58,874
<i>To Brooks, everyone is a little shit.
Everyone in the whole wide world.</i>

635
01:01:58,875 --> 01:02:02,980
Including me, including you.
Including even Carlos, for God's sake!

636
01:02:02,981 --> 01:02:05,399
But not Leo.

637
01:02:06,779 --> 01:02:09,580
Not the sainted grandfather.

638
01:02:14,259 --> 01:02:16,866
<i>- (Barbara) What was it he said?
- (Tony) Who?</i>

639
01:02:16,867 --> 01:02:19,783
Hemingway, I think.
Or the other one...

640
01:02:19,784 --> 01:02:22,698
- Fitzgerald?
- Yes. It was one of them.

641
01:02:22,699 --> 01:02:27,034
- Who said?
- What it is I'm trying to remember!

642
01:02:27,494 --> 01:02:29,027
God!

643
01:02:29,028 --> 01:02:31,482
I'm turning into Nini.

644
01:02:31,483 --> 01:02:34,938
<i>Monsieur, encore.
Merci bien.</i>

645
01:02:35,359 --> 01:02:37,659
I know.
It was about Paris, I think.

646
01:02:37,660 --> 01:02:41,804
"If you're tired of Paris,
you're tired of everything. "

647
01:02:42,186 --> 01:02:44,334
I remember.

648
01:02:44,335 --> 01:02:47,133
"To say that one is tired of Paris

649
01:02:47,134 --> 01:02:50,512
"is in fact to say
that one is tired of life. "

650
01:02:51,778 --> 01:02:53,617
Something like that.

651
01:02:53,618 --> 01:02:58,527
<i>Mummy hoped that with a new place
would come better things for us,</i>

652
01:02:58,528 --> 01:03:01,867
<i>and she was right -
but not completely so.</i>

653
01:03:01,981 --> 01:03:05,893
<i>But still,
Paris was a step up in the world.</i>

654
01:03:05,894 --> 01:03:09,883
<i>It was in Paris that I started
writing backwards in my notebook</i>

655
01:03:09,884 --> 01:03:13,108
<i>so that no one could
read my thoughts.</i>

656
01:03:13,873 --> 01:03:17,056
<i>But Mummy seemed to be able
to read them anyway,</i>

657
01:03:17,057 --> 01:03:21,393
<i>as if she were inside my head,
looking out.</i>

658
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:29,447
<i>My great-grandfather Leo once said:</i>

659
01:03:29,448 --> 01:03:31,135
<i>"One of the uses of money is</i>

660
01:03:31,136 --> 01:03:36,009
<i>"that it allows us not to live with
the consequences of our mistakes. "</i>

661
01:03:36,429 --> 01:03:40,650
<i>But I fear that, in this,
Leo was wrong.</i>

662
01:03:42,952 --> 01:03:44,639
<i>(Barbara) Tony?</i>

663
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:47,940
Do you know
what I would really love?

664
01:03:48,936 --> 01:03:51,044
What would you really love?

665
01:03:51,045 --> 01:03:53,463
What do you think?

666
01:03:54,997 --> 01:03:57,914
- This is so good.
- I'm glad.

667
01:03:58,373 --> 01:04:00,981
It's exactly what I wanted.

668
01:04:00,982 --> 01:04:03,934
Well, then I'm all the more glad
I was able to obtain it.

669
01:04:03,935 --> 01:04:07,926
Is there a better ice cream
in the whole world?

670
01:04:09,382 --> 01:04:12,414
- Is it Thursday?
- Yes, it is.

671
01:04:15,214 --> 01:04:17,323
I have dinner with Ethel tonight.

672
01:04:17,324 --> 01:04:20,046
- Ethel de Croisset.
- I'll make other plans.

673
01:04:20,047 --> 01:04:22,655
- She won't mind if you tag along.
- I don't want to impose.

674
01:04:22,656 --> 01:04:26,759
I don't like what happens
when you "make other plans. "

675
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:29,868
Mummy... please.

676
01:04:30,481 --> 01:04:33,818
The afternoon
of the longest laundry?

677
01:04:33,819 --> 01:04:37,196
- I don't do that anymore.
- Mmm... Hm!

678
01:04:38,767 --> 01:04:41,416
What does the G stand for?

679
01:04:42,719 --> 01:04:45,520
- What, dear?
- The G.

680
01:04:46,401 --> 01:04:49,587
"George" - like his father.

681
01:04:52,847 --> 01:04:55,648
Do my wrists, would you?

682
01:05:56,451 --> 01:05:58,868
That was lovely.

683
01:05:59,327 --> 01:06:01,746
And now...

684
01:06:03,049 --> 01:06:05,581
I need some privacy.

685
01:06:08,879 --> 01:06:11,873
Scoot, so that I can get dressed.

686
01:06:19,621 --> 01:06:22,230
Teeny. I'm so sorry.

687
01:06:22,805 --> 01:06:27,523
<i>Mummy always said that I should be
furious with you for stealing my girl.</i>

688
01:06:27,524 --> 01:06:29,671
<i>But I said:</i>

689
01:06:29,672 --> 01:06:32,394
<i>"Mummy, he didn't hurt me.</i>

690
01:06:32,395 --> 01:06:34,351
<i>"He hurt you. "</i>

691
01:06:34,352 --> 01:06:37,345
<i>Still, Papa,
you should have come back.</i>

692
01:06:37,535 --> 01:06:41,679
<i>I thought that one day
you'd wake up and know that, too.</i>

693
01:06:41,755 --> 01:06:44,212
<i>But you never did.</i>

694
01:06:45,861 --> 01:06:48,736
<i>And something else
I want you to know:</i>

695
01:06:48,737 --> 01:06:51,806
<i>Giotto's collar has disappeared,</i>

696
01:06:51,807 --> 01:06:56,257
<i>and I will not be able to sleep
until we find it.</i>

697
01:07:52,878 --> 01:07:55,295
<i>(Barbara) Not the formal opening dinner -</i>

698
01:07:55,296 --> 01:07:59,667
that's me and 17 of the dealer's
closest friends getting pissed at Regine's.

699
01:08:01,203 --> 01:08:03,119
<i>This is different, more intime.</i>

700
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:07,647
I was thinking that after the vernissage
I would gather together a small group -

701
01:08:07,648 --> 01:08:11,483
you and Mishka, of course,
and Ethel de Croisset and the Duráns

702
01:08:11,484 --> 01:08:15,396
and Bill and Rose Styron,
if they are still in town.

703
01:08:15,397 --> 01:08:18,234
Not buyers -
not... not a business thing.

704
01:08:18,235 --> 01:08:20,229
- Thank you.
- People you love,

705
01:08:20,230 --> 01:08:22,339
and who I know would love each other.

706
01:08:22,340 --> 01:08:25,600
I can't begin to tell you
how much Tony adores London.

707
01:08:25,601 --> 01:08:29,206
I believe it's brought about
a sea change in him.

708
01:08:29,207 --> 01:08:32,275
Do you remember, in Paris,
how down he could get,

709
01:08:32,276 --> 01:08:34,614
how... pulled within himself?

710
01:08:34,615 --> 01:08:36,609
And then, in the morning,
how agitated?

711
01:08:36,610 --> 01:08:38,911
Well... that's still Tony,
of course.

712
01:08:38,912 --> 01:08:42,710
But in London he eats,
he walks, he even shops.

713
01:08:42,711 --> 01:08:46,008
This morning we stayed in bed until 11
reading the newspapers.

714
01:08:46,009 --> 01:08:49,041
For him, that's unheard of.
For me, paradise.

715
01:08:49,691 --> 01:08:53,222
- Oh, thank you.
- It's a pleasure.

716
01:08:53,758 --> 01:08:57,210
What do you think, Mishka,
of a small dinner following the vernissage?

717
01:08:57,211 --> 01:08:59,704
What's not to like?
It sounds like a great idea.

718
01:08:59,705 --> 01:09:02,043
Well, I was thinking
I might have it here.

719
01:09:02,044 --> 01:09:05,535
I thought it might add
a note of class to my own little works,

720
01:09:05,536 --> 01:09:07,644
which they in no way,
on their own merits...

721
01:09:07,645 --> 01:09:11,789
Of course you can have
your little dinner over here.

722
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:16,010
I don't know how to thank you.

723
01:09:16,967 --> 01:09:20,076
Tony will be thrilled.

724
01:09:26,596 --> 01:09:30,012
Well? Where is it?

725
01:09:32,926 --> 01:09:35,035
Where is it?

726
01:09:35,036 --> 01:09:37,030
Where did you put it?

727
01:09:37,031 --> 01:09:40,482
It is not my responsibility
to keep track of your objects.

728
01:09:40,483 --> 01:09:42,477
But it's not anywhere.

729
01:09:42,478 --> 01:09:46,045
Missy Harnden
is the soul of graciousness.

730
01:09:46,046 --> 01:09:49,574
When I mentioned that there would be
a vernissage after the opening,

731
01:09:49,575 --> 01:09:54,522
<i>she offered to host a little dinner...
chez Harnden.</i>

732
01:09:54,523 --> 01:09:56,594
I'm so happy for you, Mummy.

733
01:09:56,595 --> 01:09:59,739
I like the way you've been dressing lately.
Is that from Gieves?

734
01:09:59,740 --> 01:10:03,500
No. Actually, it's from Anderson,
from Anderson & Sheppard.

735
01:10:03,501 --> 01:10:06,645
- Did you just walk in?
- No. You might just walk into Gieves,

736
01:10:06,646 --> 01:10:10,557
but you're not going to walk into Anderson -
you get walked into Anderson.

737
01:10:10,558 --> 01:10:13,281
In my case,
by Timothy Chalmers.

738
01:10:13,282 --> 01:10:17,848
Have you been seeing a lot
of young Timothy Chalmers?

739
01:10:19,383 --> 01:10:22,527
I don't think he's the kind of person
you want to learn from,

740
01:10:22,528 --> 01:10:25,406
if what you want to learn
is how to be a man.

741
01:10:27,207 --> 01:10:31,311
- What do you mean?
- I don't think Timothy likes women much.

742
01:10:31,312 --> 01:10:34,421
Oh, he's English, is all.

743
01:10:34,726 --> 01:10:37,756
He's the kind of person
that does things for people -

744
01:10:37,757 --> 01:10:41,401
in the way that Missy Harnden
does for you.

745
01:10:41,402 --> 01:10:43,740
I hope you haven't incurred
any obligation.

746
01:10:43,741 --> 01:10:47,538
Mother, we're talking about
an introduction to a tailor, a clothier.

747
01:10:47,539 --> 01:10:52,221
Well, I very much like
this material... this fabric.

748
01:10:54,445 --> 01:10:57,743
- What would you call it?
- It's a worsted, I should think.

749
01:10:57,744 --> 01:10:59,967
It's much nicer than
your other worsted.

750
01:10:59,968 --> 01:11:03,039
Well, that's Anderson.

751
01:11:06,567 --> 01:11:08,985
This is interesting.

752
01:11:10,173 --> 01:11:13,663
Barbara... please.

753
01:11:13,664 --> 01:11:18,381
You don't seem to mind it.
Part of you doesn't seem to mind it.

754
01:11:18,382 --> 01:11:22,678
I suppose I don't... mind.

755
01:11:22,679 --> 01:11:25,862
- You might even enjoy it.
- I might.

756
01:11:25,863 --> 01:11:28,972
Ah, I'm finding some buttons here.

757
01:11:30,044 --> 01:11:33,573
- How many?
- Five.

758
01:11:33,574 --> 01:11:36,375
- They do them with five.
- That's five.

759
01:11:37,524 --> 01:11:39,943
That's four.

760
01:11:40,516 --> 01:11:42,935
That's three.

761
01:11:45,581 --> 01:11:48,267
Hold that thought.

762
01:12:00,351 --> 01:12:02,921
God...

763
01:12:20,375 --> 01:12:22,522
I like the boxers you've chosen.

764
01:12:22,523 --> 01:12:25,823
I picked them out for myself.

765
01:12:43,047 --> 01:12:45,040
How does that feel?

766
01:12:45,041 --> 01:12:47,612
I think you know.

767
01:13:54,437 --> 01:13:57,353
Did you come?

768
01:13:57,354 --> 01:13:59,349
No.

769
01:14:04,987 --> 01:14:08,211
We can do something about that.

770
01:15:01,188 --> 01:15:03,680
You're the best.

771
01:15:03,681 --> 01:15:06,099
You are.

772
01:15:06,712 --> 01:15:09,820
You are the best.

773
01:15:10,509 --> 01:15:14,002
Are you sure
you didn't put it anywhere?

774
01:15:33,334 --> 01:15:37,208
Why do you care so much
about this thing?

775
01:15:37,209 --> 01:15:40,661
For the same reason that
anyone cares about anything -

776
01:15:40,662 --> 01:15:44,382
for its value,
its sentimental value.

777
01:15:44,383 --> 01:15:46,529
We are talking about a dog collar...

778
01:15:46,530 --> 01:15:49,637
We are talking about a collar
that belonged to Giotto,

779
01:15:49,638 --> 01:15:53,013
- a dog I loved, and a dog that died!
- Inside voice, please.

780
01:15:53,014 --> 01:15:55,661
Now the dog is gone,
but we still have the collar,

781
01:15:55,662 --> 01:15:58,690
and we have moved
and moved and moved,

782
01:15:58,691 --> 01:16:00,494
and we have never lost it!

783
01:16:00,495 --> 01:16:02,912
Oh, Tony, please.

784
01:16:07,169 --> 01:16:10,087
Go look for it.

785
01:16:13,576 --> 01:16:15,649
Go!

786
01:16:50,748 --> 01:16:53,128
Tony?

787
01:16:54,239 --> 01:16:56,657
Tony!

788
01:17:04,674 --> 01:17:07,358
Get your thumb
out of your mouth.

789
01:17:07,359 --> 01:17:10,237
You are not a fucking baby!

790
01:17:20,095 --> 01:17:22,705
You hid it.

791
01:17:23,663 --> 01:17:29,300
You hid it in the cupboard. At the very back
of the cupboard, with Nini's silver.

792
01:17:29,301 --> 01:17:32,945
- I did no such thing.
- Then how did it get there?

793
01:17:32,946 --> 01:17:35,746
Well, maybe you put it there
for safekeeping,

794
01:17:35,747 --> 01:17:38,548
and then you forgot.

795
01:17:51,936 --> 01:17:55,044
Everything's gonna be all right.

796
01:17:58,189 --> 01:18:01,872
<i>- Let me help you. Tony. Tony...

797
01:18:20,132 --> 01:18:25,693
After we fought this morning
you wrote something on a piece of paper.

798
01:18:25,694 --> 01:18:27,879
And I was so angry...

799
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:32,597
that when you went out for lunch
I just had to tear it up.

800
01:18:32,598 --> 01:18:37,319
We didn't fight this morning. We stayed in
and read the papers, remember?

801
01:18:39,620 --> 01:18:43,339
You wrote it
in that backwards writing.

802
01:18:43,340 --> 01:18:45,372
But I'm not stupid.

803
01:18:45,373 --> 01:18:49,824
I know that you think
I'm not smart, but I'm...

804
01:18:49,976 --> 01:18:53,659
smart enough to know that
if there is a piece of backward writing...

805
01:18:55,847 --> 01:18:58,686
...why, you just hold it up to a mirror.

806
01:19:00,450 --> 01:19:04,668
So I tore it into little pieces,
and I flushed it down the toilet.

807
01:19:04,669 --> 01:19:10,845
But you know how that toilet is, and
those pieces kept... kept floating to the top.

808
01:19:10,846 --> 01:19:14,489
I don't know what you're talking about.
When you talk nonsense I can't...

809
01:19:14,490 --> 01:19:16,637
- I'm not talking...
- I can't help you.

810
01:19:16,638 --> 01:19:19,631
- I am telling you!
- You are spouting!

811
01:20:09,884 --> 01:20:12,763
I'm going to call an ambulance.

812
01:20:29,065 --> 01:20:31,138
<i>(Tony) Yes.</i>

813
01:20:31,482 --> 01:20:35,857
83... Cadogan Square.

814
01:20:38,273 --> 01:20:40,150
Thank you.

815
01:21:05,855 --> 01:21:08,733
Yes, I'd like to place an order.

816
01:21:10,535 --> 01:21:12,952
To be delivered.

817
01:21:14,371 --> 01:21:16,789
Yes. Baekeland.

818
01:21:19,894 --> 01:21:22,313
I'm very hungry.

819
01:21:23,462 --> 01:21:28,527
Yeah, those thin rice noodles
with pork, shredded pork.

820
01:21:29,869 --> 01:21:32,285
Yeah, that would be it.

821
01:21:32,286 --> 01:21:35,470
And some rice, some fried rice.

822
01:21:36,543 --> 01:21:38,922
No, the large.

823
01:21:49,931 --> 01:21:51,887
<i>Dear Papa,</i>

824
01:21:51,888 --> 01:21:55,188
<i>I'm hoping you receive this letter.</i>

825
01:22:00,750 --> 01:22:03,166
<i>During the time
preceding what happened</i>

826
01:22:03,167 --> 01:22:06,541
<i>a lot of rather strange things
were happening.</i>

827
01:22:06,542 --> 01:22:08,421
<i>Earlier that afternoon</i>

828
01:22:08,422 --> 01:22:13,677
<i>I had a telephone call
from a friend of ours who lives in Wales.</i>

829
01:22:13,678 --> 01:22:17,321
<i>She told me
I had fallen down an elevator shaft.</i>

830
01:22:17,322 --> 01:22:21,349
<i>- I thought this rather strange.</i>

831
01:22:21,350 --> 01:22:24,881
<i>And yet it had
a profound effect on me.</i>

832
01:22:29,714 --> 01:22:32,323
<i>I was in a dreadful state.</i>

833
01:22:33,319 --> 01:22:37,040
<i>For a long time
I didn't know where I was.</i>

834
01:22:37,041 --> 01:22:40,146
<i>Past memories
kept flooding my mind,</i>

835
01:22:40,147 --> 01:22:44,982
<i>and I felt like I was re-enacting
parts of my former life.</i>

836
01:22:45,749 --> 01:22:51,463
<i>You know I loved, and still love and adore,
Mummy more than anyone in the world.</i>

837
01:22:51,464 --> 01:22:53,882
Hello?

838
01:22:55,147 --> 01:22:57,565
Hello?

839
01:22:58,178 --> 01:23:00,595
Mr. Baekeland?

840
01:23:05,236 --> 01:23:07,230
You would be Mr. Baekeland, sir?

841
01:23:07,231 --> 01:23:09,148
Yes.

842
01:23:09,149 --> 01:23:12,948
- And this would be?
- My mother.

843
01:23:17,396 --> 01:23:21,273
<i>I do wish
we could all be together again.</i>

844
01:23:22,653 --> 01:23:27,257
<i>And another thing is,
I have so much in my head that...</i>

845
01:23:27,716 --> 01:23:30,824
<i>to let it out would surely kill me.</i>
