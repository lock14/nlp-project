- Dad, are you awake?
- Yes.

2
00:01:22,267 --> 00:01:24,700
It's time to get up.
What do you think?

3
00:01:24,735 --> 00:01:27,133
- Is it breakfast time?
- Yes, it sure is.

4
00:01:27,168 --> 00:01:30,567
- Well...
- Better get up.

5
00:01:30,602 --> 00:01:32,501
I need a bite.

6
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,265

Yeah, on the

Dad, I got your breakfast.

9
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,332
Good for you.
It looks delicious.

10
00:01:47,367 --> 00:01:50,033
Do you need anything else?
Piece of toast,
cup of coffee?

11
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:52,367
No, I don't need no
coffee this morning.

12

the orange juice.

doing today?

17
00:03:02,536 --> 00:03:03,985
She's doing good.

No, she hasn't found anything.

- Good morning.
- Hey, how are you doing today?

21
00:03:16,168 --> 00:03:18,933
- Good. How are you?
- Terrific.

22
00:03:18,968 --> 00:03:20,767
What can I help you
with this morning?

23
00:03:20,802 --> 00:03:23,032
I think I'll have...
a twister.

24
00:03:23,067 --> 00:03:25,567
- Okay. Is this
for here or to go?
- It'll be for here.

25

I want to get
a picture.

26
00:03:34,133 --> 00:03:35,532

my bestest friend.

a picture of you.

to go in there,
you think?

yesterday.
- Yeah?

34

She was telling me about
the huge order they have
coming in,

35
00:04:04,418 --> 00:04:07,634
which means we're really
gonna have to pump up
production.

36
00:04:07,669 --> 00:04:10,418
- That's great.
- That's what I thought.

37

We're already doing
too much as it is.

38
00:04:13,202 --> 00:04:15,199
I think so too.

some more help.

maybe you can give me a ride

at the shovel factory?

44
00:06:30,435 --> 00:06:32,766
- You know I will.
- Yeah.

45
00:06:32,801 --> 00:06:36,067
I always told you
if you ever needed
a ride or anything,

46
00:06:36,102 --> 00:06:38,634
all you had to do was ask.

47
00:06:38,669 --> 00:06:39,968
I appreciate it.

48
00:06:40,003 --> 00:06:41,534
No problem.

49
00:06:47,234 --> 00:06:50,501
You been out
on a date lately?

50

No, not for a while.

No prospects, huh?

52
00:06:54,501 --> 00:06:57,065
No. I've been busy
working pretty much.

53
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:01,033
I leave here and I only got
so much time before I have
to go to the other job, so...

54
00:07:01,068 --> 00:07:03,732
It's about like
the rest of us,
I'm telling you.

55
00:07:03,767 --> 00:07:06,767
Plus I gotta work nights,
so if I want to go out at night,

56
00:07:06,802 --> 00:07:10,067
I can't do that,
unless I have a day off, so...

- I'm ready for the beaches.
- Yeah?

58
00:07:12,634 --> 00:07:14,599
- Yeah. I want to go to Aruba.
- Oh, yeah?

59
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:18,434
I saw that on TV the other day.
The beaches are great.

How about you?

Yeah. I'm gonna
go and smoke.

your dad lately?

Um, no, not since
the last time.

64

It's probably...
six months ago.

Where's he at now?

Last I heard he was living
in Arizona, I think,

67
00:07:55,085 --> 00:07:58,567

remarried to someone.

It was all right.
How are you?

I'm all right.

do you have airbrush experience?

Yeah. I used to airbrush
T-shirts at the mall.

Great. When you were doing that,
were you working with
other airbrushers,

or were you just
waiting on the customers?

91
00:12:08,968 --> 00:12:12,167
No. I just worked by myself.
They would bring me
what I needed,

bring me the orders,
and I would take care of it.

to find Rose

in the fact that she has
airbrush experience.

101
00:12:32,767 --> 00:12:37,267
She's worked with stencils
before, so she'll be working
in the head-painting area.

I'm sure she'll have questions
throughout the day,
so please help her.

fit in really well
with our workforce here.

introduce her through
the course of the day,

00:19:12,534 --> 00:19:14,033
Rose?

170
00:19:17,901 --> 00:19:19,365
Where are you?

171
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,334
I'm in the bathroom.

172
00:19:35,968 --> 00:19:39,434
Oh, my God, Rose!
What are you doing?

173
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:41,067
I'm taking a bath.

174
00:19:44,234 --> 00:19:46,501
Do you do this
all the time?

175
00:19:46,536 --> 00:19:49,032
No, not all the time.

176
00:19:49,067 --> 00:19:51,200
Remember when I told you
I worked in a nursing home?

177
00:19:51,235 --> 00:19:52,833
I sure did.

178
00:19:52,868 --> 00:19:57,132
I got hit in the back
with a tray table
by this little old man.

179
00:19:57,167 --> 00:20:00,232
And it messed up my back.
I couldn't pick Jesse up
for like a month.

180
00:20:00,267 --> 00:20:04,567
But every once in a while
my muscles will contract,
and I get really sore.

181
00:20:04,602 --> 00:20:06,499
And this feels
really good.

182
00:20:06,534 --> 00:20:08,499
And my apartment
has no bathtub.

183
00:20:08,534 --> 00:20:11,732
It just has a shower,
so I take advantage.

184
00:20:11,767 --> 00:20:15,033
But I clean it when I'm done.
I clean after I bathe.

185
00:20:15,068 --> 00:20:16,901
- Okay.
- [Giggles]

186
00:20:16,936 --> 00:20:18,699
I was kind of wondering.

187
00:20:18,734 --> 00:20:20,901
I didn't know what would happen
if we'd get caught.

188
00:20:20,936 --> 00:20:23,901
No. She won't be here
for a long time.

189
00:20:23,936 --> 00:20:26,532
Oh, my gosh!

190
00:20:26,567 --> 00:20:30,634
I mean, every room
was the size of
my whole living room.

191
00:20:30,669 --> 00:20:31,866
The bedrooms...

192
00:20:31,901 --> 00:20:36,133
You could fit my whole house
in two rooms in that house.

193
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:38,799
I could not believe it.
Gorgeous!

194
00:20:38,834 --> 00:20:42,400
Chandeliers coming down
out of the ceiling.

195
00:20:42,435 --> 00:20:44,766
- It was unreal.
- Hmm.

196
00:20:44,801 --> 00:20:48,267
I mean, just fabulous,
fabulous, fabulous.

197
00:20:48,302 --> 00:20:52,551
And then... you are not
gonna believe this.

198
00:20:52,586 --> 00:20:56,766
She tells me how particular
this lady is.

199
00:20:56,801 --> 00:21:01,033
And then she invites me
inside of this house
that she's cleaning.

200
00:21:01,068 --> 00:21:02,332
Guess what.

201
00:21:02,367 --> 00:21:05,567
She was in
the Jacuzzi bathtub...

202
00:21:05,602 --> 00:21:08,732
I am not kidding...
taking a bath.

203
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:11,467
- She was supposed to be
cleaning it?
- Yes!

204
00:21:11,502 --> 00:21:13,466
- Got sidetracked.
- I'm not kidding.

205
00:21:13,501 --> 00:21:16,199
I couldn't believe it.
I thought I was gonna die.

206
00:21:16,234 --> 00:21:19,734
All I could think about
was that lady coming home
and catching...

207
00:21:19,769 --> 00:21:22,400
You know, here I am,
not supposed to be there,

208
00:21:22,435 --> 00:21:24,267
in there checking
her house out,

209
00:21:24,302 --> 00:21:27,184
and there's Rose
in the tub.

210
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:30,032
And you know,
I thought, "Wow."

211
00:21:30,067 --> 00:21:33,100
Yeah, I'd be afraid of 'em
just coming home too early.

212
00:21:33,135 --> 00:21:35,617
I'm not too sure
about her.

213
00:21:35,652 --> 00:21:38,065
- Yeah?
- What do you think?

214
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,334
I don't know.
She seems fine to me.

215
00:21:40,369 --> 00:21:42,968
- You think so?
- Yeah.

216
00:21:43,003 --> 00:21:45,567
She scares me a little.

217
00:21:45,602 --> 00:21:46,667
Hmm.

218
00:23:07,267 --> 00:23:09,300
[Air hissing]

219
00:23:17,701 --> 00:23:21,067
I was working at a restaurant,
and they work day and night.

220
00:23:21,102 --> 00:23:22,899
Turn two different shifts.

221
00:23:22,934 --> 00:23:26,065
I just didn't have anybody
to care for him.

222
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:29,934
It was really rough,
and I didn't want to have
to put him in a nursing home.

223
00:23:29,969 --> 00:23:31,965
- The expense for that is huge.
- Yeah, those places...

224
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,100
And you don't want to do that
unless you absolutely have to.

225
00:23:35,135 --> 00:23:36,566
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

226
00:23:36,601 --> 00:23:38,399
Because a lot of times
they're understaffed

227
00:23:38,434 --> 00:23:41,332
or they don't have all the
equipment that they need.

228
00:23:41,367 --> 00:23:44,100
You know, you get people in
there that shouldn't be there,

229
00:23:44,135 --> 00:23:46,834
that should be in other
facilities, that are violent.

230
00:23:46,869 --> 00:23:49,735
You know, you just, you never
know what you're gonna get.

231
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:52,601
You don't know who they're gonna
put in the room with 'em.

232
00:23:52,636 --> 00:23:54,534
You know,
because it's not...

233
00:23:56,434 --> 00:24:01,400
The way that they put people
together is not necessarily
by what their sickness may be,

234
00:24:01,435 --> 00:24:04,998
like, you know, put two stroke
patients in the same room.

235
00:24:05,033 --> 00:24:09,100
Some people might be bedridden,
and some people might be up
walking around.

236
00:24:09,135 --> 00:24:11,868
And they get into each other's
things and tear stuff up.

237
00:24:11,903 --> 00:24:13,532
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah.

238
00:24:13,567 --> 00:24:15,500
- Glad I didn't do that.
- No.

239
00:24:15,535 --> 00:24:17,399
And as far as, like,
management,

240
00:24:17,434 --> 00:24:20,632
they're so tight that
what they'll do is take...

241
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:24,317
You know, you might clock
out, but if they see you
walking across the parking lot,

242
00:24:24,352 --> 00:24:27,968
they'll be like, "Can you come
just for a minute and come
help with this or that?"

243
00:24:28,003 --> 00:24:30,635
And you end up staying over
an hour or better.

244
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:33,267
And that happens
three or four days a week.

245
00:24:33,302 --> 00:24:34,998
So you don't even get paid.

246
00:24:35,033 --> 00:24:37,467
But you need your job,
so what do you say?

247
00:24:37,502 --> 00:24:39,399
- Yeah.
- You're kind of st...

248
00:24:39,434 --> 00:24:42,267
You don't want to make
anybody mad, you know.

249
00:24:42,302 --> 00:24:45,868
- And they do it to everybody.
- Oh, really?

250
00:24:45,903 --> 00:24:49,399
So everybody kind of
just did it, you know?

251
00:24:49,434 --> 00:24:52,467
[Woman] Wow. I can't imagine
them doing that here.

252
00:24:52,502 --> 00:24:55,466
We're gonna make quota
and get some of that bonus.

253
00:24:55,501 --> 00:24:58,933
- Did you guys hear about that?
- No, I haven't heard anything.

254
00:24:58,968 --> 00:25:03,400
Yeah, we're gonna get probably
about $50 if we meet quota
at the end of the week.

255
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:05,184
I thought
that was great.

256
00:25:05,219 --> 00:25:06,899
That's awfully
nice of 'em.

257
00:25:06,934 --> 00:25:10,300
Yeah, that'll
help me out a lot
with bills and things.

258
00:25:10,335 --> 00:25:13,167
That's what
you'd spend it on
if you got it?

259
00:25:19,534 --> 00:25:21,400
I probably will just...

260
00:25:21,435 --> 00:25:23,033
I don't know.

261
00:25:24,234 --> 00:25:26,432
I haven't really
thought about it.

262
00:25:26,467 --> 00:25:28,833
What do you think
you'll spend yours on?

263
00:25:28,868 --> 00:25:31,517
I don't know.
If the weather
keeps getting nice,

264
00:25:31,552 --> 00:25:34,167
I'll get camping equipment
or something like that.

265
00:25:34,202 --> 00:25:37,234
- Oh, that sounds like fun.
- Mm-hmm.

266
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:43,367
Well, if you're looking
to make a little bit
of extra money,

267
00:25:43,402 --> 00:25:45,265
I was wanting to go out
this weekend.

268
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:49,199
If you want to baby-sit Jesse
for a few hours,

269
00:25:49,234 --> 00:25:51,634
I couldn't pay a whole lot,
but I could give you
a little bit.

270
00:25:51,669 --> 00:25:54,934
- What night?
- Friday night.

271
00:25:54,969 --> 00:25:58,165
If that would
work out for you.

272
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,667
Sure. I think I could
do that for you.

273
00:26:00,702 --> 00:26:01,799
- Could you?
- Yeah.

274
00:26:01,834 --> 00:26:04,067
- She's really good.
- How old is she?

275
00:26:04,102 --> 00:26:06,532
- She's two.
- Okay.

276
00:26:06,567 --> 00:26:10,934
It'll be nice for her too,
'cause it'll give her
somebody else to be around.

277
00:26:10,969 --> 00:26:13,968
She doesn't... She's not around
too many other people.

278
00:26:14,003 --> 00:26:15,799
[Woman]
What's she like to do?

279
00:26:15,834 --> 00:26:18,701
[Rose] She likes to color
and she likes to read books.

280
00:26:18,736 --> 00:26:20,032
[Woman]
Okay.

281
00:26:20,067 --> 00:26:23,834
Yeah, and she goes to bed
at 8:00, so more than likely...

282
00:26:23,869 --> 00:26:26,601
That's great, 'cause
that way I can sew after...

283
00:26:26,636 --> 00:26:29,799
- Oh, yeah.
- That's good, that's good.

284
00:26:29,834 --> 00:26:33,667
- Okay, no problem.
- Great. I'm excited now.

285
00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:44,134
Are you about done?

286
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:45,699
Yeah, pretty much.

287
00:26:45,734 --> 00:26:47,968
- Wanna have a smoke?
- Sure.

288
00:27:40,334 --> 00:27:44,666
Now, you know I
probably won't be home
till about 11:00,

289
00:27:44,701 --> 00:27:47,917
and I left a number hanging
on the refrigerator
if you need me.

290
00:27:47,952 --> 00:27:51,133
- I was wondering if
you left me a number.
- Yeah, I sure did.

291
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:54,167
- If I need to get ahold of you.
- Yes, I did.

292
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:08,334
[Rose] So she should be going
to bed in about a half an hour,
usually about 8:00.

293
00:28:08,369 --> 00:28:11,132
About 15 minutes before
you put her to bed,

294
00:28:11,167 --> 00:28:13,834
just give her a few goldfish
crackers and some juice,

295
00:28:13,869 --> 00:28:16,732
just enough to put
something in her stomach.

296
00:28:16,767 --> 00:28:20,601
But she should be all right.
She may cry whenever I leave.

297
00:28:20,636 --> 00:28:23,365
- Just kind of expect it.
- Okay.

298
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,600
All you have to do is lay her
down and just read her a book,

299
00:28:26,635 --> 00:28:29,801
and she'll get her blanket,
suck her thumb
and she'll be done.

300
00:28:29,836 --> 00:28:32,801
All right.
That sounds great.

301
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:34,868
She's pretty easy.

302
00:28:34,903 --> 00:28:36,766
[Gurgling]

303
00:28:36,801 --> 00:28:39,667
Hey, sweetie,
what do you have there?

304
00:28:39,702 --> 00:28:40,766
[Knocking]

305
00:28:40,801 --> 00:28:44,400
[Gasps]
Who's here?

306
00:28:44,435 --> 00:28:46,034
Who's here?

307
00:28:46,069 --> 00:28:47,634
Watch out.

308
00:28:50,767 --> 00:28:53,300
- Hey, come in.
- Hey, come in.

309
00:28:53,335 --> 00:28:54,567
Hello.

310
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:56,767
Come here, sweetie.

311
00:28:58,033 --> 00:28:59,699
Who's the man?

312
00:28:59,734 --> 00:29:02,501
- What are you doing?
- Oh, nothing.

313
00:29:02,536 --> 00:29:05,868
[Jesse jabbering]

314
00:29:08,601 --> 00:29:12,901
- So, this is your date?
- Yeah.

315
00:29:12,936 --> 00:29:15,132
Oh.

316
00:29:15,167 --> 00:29:17,934
We're going out tonight
for a little bit.

317
00:29:17,969 --> 00:29:20,933
And, uh, who's driving?

318
00:29:20,968 --> 00:29:25,234
I am. I borrowed a...
I borrowed a car
off my friend.

319
00:29:25,269 --> 00:29:27,299
Oh.

320
00:29:27,334 --> 00:29:30,100
He let me take it out
tonight.

321
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:32,065
I see.

322
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:35,399
Can I have a kiss?

323
00:29:35,434 --> 00:29:38,334
Mommy's gonna go
for a little bit.
Are you gonna be okay?

324
00:29:38,369 --> 00:29:40,566
- No!
- Yes, you will.

325
00:29:40,601 --> 00:29:44,400
- I want my baby!
- Okay, you get your baby.

326
00:29:44,435 --> 00:29:47,518
- I guess we're gonna go and...
- Okay.

327
00:29:47,553 --> 00:29:50,566
- What's that?
- It's another baby.

328
00:29:50,601 --> 00:29:53,133
You can take that baby
and go night-night with it.

329
00:29:53,168 --> 00:29:56,684
- Love you.
- Mama, I wanna go with you.

330
00:29:56,719 --> 00:30:00,200
No. You're gonna
stay here with Martha.

331
00:30:00,235 --> 00:30:02,468
Yeah. You're gonna have fun.

332
00:30:02,503 --> 00:30:04,666
- Come here, sweetie.
- No!

333
00:30:04,701 --> 00:30:06,901
We'll read a story.
Would you like to
read a story?

334
00:30:06,936 --> 00:30:11,799
- No!
- I see a really nice book.

335
00:30:11,834 --> 00:30:14,501
Look! She's got a book.
And she's gonna read to you.

336
00:30:14,536 --> 00:30:17,732
- No!
- I'll be back in a little bit.

337
00:30:17,767 --> 00:30:22,634
- Here, give me a kiss.
- No! I want to go that way!

338
00:30:22,669 --> 00:30:24,601
You might want
to get her now.

339
00:30:24,636 --> 00:30:26,752
I go that way!
[Crying]

340
00:30:26,787 --> 00:30:28,833
- Come here, sweetie.
- No!

341
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:33,200
- Do you want to play
with some toys?
- No!

342
00:30:33,235 --> 00:30:35,901
- Well, come on.
- No!

343
00:30:35,936 --> 00:30:37,067
Oh, sweetie.

344
00:30:42,801 --> 00:30:46,667
Yeah, but seriously,
it seems like every time
I think I'm saving a little bit,

345
00:30:46,702 --> 00:30:49,334
getting a little bit ahead,
something comes up.

346
00:30:49,369 --> 00:30:52,132
- Jesse gets sick.
- Yeah.

347
00:30:52,167 --> 00:30:54,132
Have you been able
to save much?

348
00:30:54,167 --> 00:30:57,567
A little bit. I don't have
a checking account
or anything, but...

349
00:30:57,602 --> 00:30:59,767
I got drawer change
I've been saving.

350
00:30:59,802 --> 00:31:02,234
- Drawer change, huh?
- Yeah.

351
00:31:02,269 --> 00:31:04,632
Yeah, he's got
his own place,

352
00:31:04,667 --> 00:31:07,383
and then Jesse and I
live together.

353
00:31:07,418 --> 00:31:10,065
Yeah, he wasn't ready
for our baby.

354
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:13,934
He's an artist,
and he's very into his work
and what's going on with him.

355
00:31:13,969 --> 00:31:16,868
He doesn't have time, you know,
for anybody else.

356
00:31:16,903 --> 00:31:18,499
But he helps out with her.

357
00:31:18,534 --> 00:31:22,467
He baby-sits while I work
sometimes, if he has time,
or whatever.

358
00:31:22,502 --> 00:31:26,400
That's good.
At least he sticks around
a little bit and sees her.

359
00:31:26,435 --> 00:31:30,133
Yeah.
He makes an effort.

360
00:31:32,033 --> 00:31:34,566
So did you finish
high school?

361
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:39,567
No. Actually, I had anxiety,
and I ended up quitting.

362
00:31:39,602 --> 00:31:41,132
What is that?

363
00:31:41,167 --> 00:31:44,299
Oh, just when I got around
a lot of people, you know,

364
00:31:44,334 --> 00:31:47,567
I'd get a little bit nervous
and sometimes I'd have
a panic attack.

365
00:31:47,602 --> 00:31:50,098
- Really?
- Yeah.

366
00:31:50,133 --> 00:31:53,933
It was pretty bad,
enough to quit.

367
00:31:53,968 --> 00:31:57,167
Did you go to a doctor
or anything for that?

368
00:31:57,202 --> 00:31:59,232
Um...

369
00:31:59,267 --> 00:32:00,998
Yeah, I did at one point,

370
00:32:01,033 --> 00:32:04,567
but they just kept prescribing
me pills that didn't work,

371
00:32:04,602 --> 00:32:06,901
so I eventually
just quit going

372
00:32:06,936 --> 00:32:09,165
and dealt with it myself,
you know?

373
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,934
There's not much
you can do about it, so...

374
00:32:11,969 --> 00:32:14,000
Are you taking anything
right now?

375
00:32:14,035 --> 00:32:16,833
- No.
- No?

376
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:20,133
And how do you do?
Does that bother you anymore?

377
00:32:20,168 --> 00:32:21,732
It's not as bad now,
you know.

378
00:32:21,767 --> 00:32:25,601
Usually, the places I go,
there's not 400 people
like school.

379
00:32:25,636 --> 00:32:26,998
Yeah.

380
00:32:27,033 --> 00:32:29,750
It's usually when
there's a lot of people.

381
00:32:29,785 --> 00:32:32,467
Lately, it's only temporary
when it's bad.

382
00:32:32,502 --> 00:32:33,701
Mm-hmm.

383
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,901
Did you finish high school?

384
00:32:37,936 --> 00:32:39,768
No, I didn't finish.

385
00:32:39,803 --> 00:32:41,566
What happened there?

386
00:32:41,601 --> 00:32:43,601
I got rebellious
in high school.

387
00:32:43,636 --> 00:32:45,632
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

388
00:32:45,667 --> 00:32:50,234
Yeah, I ran away,
hitchhiked to Charleston.

389
00:32:50,269 --> 00:32:52,566
- Yeah.
- How old were you then?

390
00:32:52,601 --> 00:32:55,367
- Fifteen.
- Kind of dangerous, isn't it?

391
00:32:55,402 --> 00:32:57,984
Yeah, a little bit.

392
00:32:58,019 --> 00:33:00,567
It was fun at the time.

393
00:33:00,602 --> 00:33:02,801
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

394
00:33:05,868 --> 00:33:07,234
And look now.

395
00:33:11,667 --> 00:33:14,067
- I'd like to save up
and get a car.
- Oh, yeah.

396
00:33:14,102 --> 00:33:16,634
- That's nice to have.
- Yeah.

397
00:33:20,067 --> 00:33:21,933
So where do you live?

398
00:33:21,968 --> 00:33:25,418
- I live with my mom right now.
- Oh, really?

399
00:33:25,453 --> 00:33:28,833
Yeah. It's just
a matter of money, really.

400
00:33:28,868 --> 00:33:31,634
Trying to save up.
It's the easiest way to do it.

401
00:33:31,669 --> 00:33:35,133
Yeah, I hear you.

402
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,683
Is your mom home
right now?

403
00:33:46,718 --> 00:33:49,367
Well, actually,
I don't know.

404
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,534
Well, would you rather
just like maybe
go back there

405
00:33:55,569 --> 00:33:58,601
where there's not
so many people?

406
00:33:58,636 --> 00:34:00,767
Well, I guess we could, yeah.

407
00:34:00,802 --> 00:34:01,934
Okay.

408
00:34:11,367 --> 00:34:16,334
Those are very pretty.
Your mom must like jewelry.

409
00:34:16,369 --> 00:34:18,132
Yeah.

410
00:34:18,167 --> 00:34:20,232
Look at that.

411
00:34:20,267 --> 00:34:21,667
- It's pretty.
- Yeah.

412
00:34:21,702 --> 00:34:23,032
Oh, we lost it.

413
00:34:23,067 --> 00:34:25,733
- It's a giraffe.
- A giraffe. Oh, okay.

414
00:34:25,768 --> 00:34:28,934
It looks like a dinosaur
a little bit.

415
00:34:28,969 --> 00:34:32,100
- It's a giraffe-dinosaur.
- Yeah.

416
00:34:32,135 --> 00:34:33,432
What's this?

417
00:34:33,467 --> 00:34:35,866
A purple necklace.

418
00:34:35,901 --> 00:34:38,767
- Is that a purple necklace?
- Yeah.

419
00:34:38,802 --> 00:34:41,968
[Baby talk]

420
00:34:42,003 --> 00:34:43,934
Yeah.

421
00:35:02,801 --> 00:35:04,867
- Hey.
- Hi.

422
00:35:04,902 --> 00:35:06,899
- Hi.
- Hi.

423
00:35:06,934 --> 00:35:08,532
Mom, this is Rose.

424
00:35:08,567 --> 00:35:11,532
- Hi, Rose. What's up?
- It's nice to meet you.

425
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:14,566
Yeah, it's nice to meet you too.
What are you guys doing?

426
00:35:14,601 --> 00:35:18,701
Nothing. This is the girl
that they hired at
the factory the other day.

427
00:35:18,736 --> 00:35:21,585
- Hi. Kyle told me about you.
- Oh, really?

428
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:24,434
Yeah, he did.
So how do you like it there?

429
00:35:24,469 --> 00:35:26,318
It's pretty good.
It's not too bad.

430
00:35:26,353 --> 00:35:28,167
It's busy but,
you know, it's a job.

431
00:35:28,202 --> 00:35:30,532
Yeah, jobs really
get that way.

432
00:35:30,567 --> 00:35:32,599
You guys wanna watch this?
It's pretty good.

433
00:35:32,634 --> 00:35:36,033
No. I think we're just gonna
go hang out in the bedroom
for a little bit.

434
00:35:36,068 --> 00:35:38,451
- Okay.
- All right.

435
00:35:38,486 --> 00:35:40,834
- Okay.
- [Laughs]

436
00:35:43,501 --> 00:35:45,834
- See you later.
- Bye.

437
00:35:52,133 --> 00:35:56,000
This is a pretty interesting
room you have.

438
00:36:00,133 --> 00:36:01,933
What's that picture of?

439
00:36:01,968 --> 00:36:05,968
That's a tattoo.
My friend drew it
for me there.

440
00:36:06,003 --> 00:36:09,367
He does tattoos
and stuff.

441
00:36:09,402 --> 00:36:11,199
That is crazy-looking.

442
00:36:11,234 --> 00:36:13,567
Yeah, it's pretty cool.
I like it.

443
00:36:14,667 --> 00:36:15,899
Do you have any tattoos?

444
00:36:15,934 --> 00:36:19,767
Yeah, I got two tattoos
on my arm here.

445
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:22,632
No kidding.

446
00:36:22,667 --> 00:36:24,750
Are they
exactly the same?

447
00:36:24,785 --> 00:36:26,834
Yeah. They're symmetrical.

448
00:36:30,701 --> 00:36:32,933
That's cool.
Are you gonna get any more?

449
00:36:32,968 --> 00:36:36,301
Yeah, I'll probably
end up getting up to
about here or so.

450
00:36:36,336 --> 00:36:39,634
He'll probably come up with
something good I can put on.

451
00:36:39,669 --> 00:36:43,267
A friend of mine in Marietta
did one on my back.

452
00:36:43,302 --> 00:36:44,699
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

453
00:36:44,734 --> 00:36:46,767
I'm not ready
for another one though.

454
00:36:46,802 --> 00:36:48,367
Did it hurt or anything?

455
00:36:48,402 --> 00:36:50,165
No, it didn't hurt.

456
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,767
I'm just, I don't know
what else I want
that's like forever.

457
00:36:52,802 --> 00:36:54,365
- Yeah.
- You know.

458
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,299
Oh, yeah.
It's definitely permanent.

459
00:36:56,334 --> 00:36:59,850
Oh, yeah. Do you like
hanging out in tattoo shops?

460
00:36:59,885 --> 00:37:03,367
Yeah. I got a couple friends
that are tattoo artists.

461
00:37:03,402 --> 00:37:06,601
Yeah, it is fun.
You meet a lot of people.

462
00:37:06,636 --> 00:37:08,466
Yeah.

463
00:37:08,501 --> 00:37:11,434
Wow. That's a nice watch.
Where'd you get that?

464
00:37:11,469 --> 00:37:12,833
Thank you.

465
00:37:12,868 --> 00:37:15,734
It was a gift from someone.
I used to clean their house.

466
00:37:15,769 --> 00:37:18,165
Oh, yeah?
Kind of like a tip?

467
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,868
- Yeah, like a big thank-you.
- That's nice of them.

468
00:37:20,903 --> 00:37:23,701
Yeah, it was
very nice of them.

469
00:37:26,667 --> 00:37:29,734
I see you've got
a lot of <i>High Times</i> stuff.
Do you smoke?

470
00:37:29,769 --> 00:37:31,318
Yeah, I'm a smoker.

471
00:37:31,353 --> 00:37:32,776
Oh, yeah? I figured.

472
00:37:32,811 --> 00:37:34,200
Yeah, I'm a smoker.

473
00:37:34,235 --> 00:37:36,065
[Laughs]

474
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:39,800
Would your mom get mad
if we smoked in here?

475
00:37:39,835 --> 00:37:43,501
Um, I think I can make it
so she won't know.

476
00:37:43,536 --> 00:37:46,501
Yeah. I just don't want her
prying in.

477
00:37:46,536 --> 00:37:47,998
Right, yeah.

478
00:37:48,033 --> 00:37:49,834
Yeah, I think we can
get away with it.

479
00:37:49,869 --> 00:37:52,332
That's cool.

480
00:37:52,367 --> 00:37:54,965
Do you, uh,
want a drink or anything?

481
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,167
You know, that would be good.
Do you have any beer?

482
00:37:57,202 --> 00:37:58,684
Yeah, I got a beer.

483
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:00,167
I'll be right back.

484
00:38:03,834 --> 00:38:05,834
[TV playing]

485
00:38:38,634 --> 00:38:41,033
- Thank you very much.
- Mm-hmm.

486
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:54,566
- Oh, man.
- What?

487
00:38:54,601 --> 00:38:57,701
It's starting to get
kind of late. I'm gonna
have to get back to Jesse.

488
00:38:57,736 --> 00:39:00,766
I told Martha we'd only be
a few hours, but...

489
00:39:00,801 --> 00:39:05,300
I'll just let you have this,
and you can save it for another
time or later, whatever.

490
00:39:05,335 --> 00:39:08,299
Okay. I'm sure I'll
save it for another time.

491
00:39:08,334 --> 00:39:11,567
We can hang out and drink
a beer, and then we're
gonna have to take off.

492
00:39:11,602 --> 00:39:14,632
All right, that's cool.

493
00:39:14,667 --> 00:39:20,100
So I don't think
I wanna go back in there
because of Martha and all.

494
00:39:20,135 --> 00:39:21,833
What about Martha?

495
00:39:21,868 --> 00:39:24,701
I don't know.
She gave me a weird vibe
when I was in there earlier

496
00:39:24,736 --> 00:39:26,701
like she was mad at me
or something.

497
00:39:26,736 --> 00:39:28,065
For going out with me?

498
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,399
I don't know.
It could be anything.

499
00:39:30,434 --> 00:39:33,901
She just gave me a weird vibe
when I was in there earlier.

500
00:39:33,936 --> 00:39:38,918
Okay, that's fine.
I did have fun with you though.

501
00:39:38,953 --> 00:39:43,901
Yeah, I did too.
Definitely have
to do it again.

502
00:39:43,936 --> 00:39:46,032
Well, just, you know,
get ahold of me.

503
00:39:46,067 --> 00:39:49,000
- Yeah, all right.
- I'll see you at work Monday.

504
00:39:49,035 --> 00:39:52,534
- Okay. Talk to you later.
- Bye.

505
00:40:18,601 --> 00:40:20,834
So how was your date?

506
00:40:20,869 --> 00:40:23,032
Oh, it was all right.

507
00:40:23,067 --> 00:40:25,367
I really wish you guys
would've told me.

508
00:40:25,402 --> 00:40:27,365
Told you what?

509
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,583
That you guys were
going out together.

510
00:40:29,618 --> 00:40:31,732
- Why?
- Well, you could've told...

511
00:40:31,767 --> 00:40:36,801
- I felt like an idiot.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

512
00:40:36,836 --> 00:40:38,532
- How was Jesse?
- Jesse was great.

513
00:40:38,567 --> 00:40:40,450
Was she? Did you have
a good time with her?

514
00:40:40,485 --> 00:40:42,334
Yeah. She really likes
those necklaces.

515
00:40:42,369 --> 00:40:45,399
Yeah, she does.
She's something.

516
00:40:45,434 --> 00:40:49,167
Sure is. She went to bed
about like what you said.

517
00:40:49,202 --> 00:40:52,901
Had her juice and her crackers
and went up to bed.

518
00:40:52,936 --> 00:40:55,200
[Knocking]

519
00:40:58,534 --> 00:41:00,868
- Hey, guess what.
- Hey.

520
00:41:02,234 --> 00:41:04,567
Guess what happened
at my house.

521
00:41:04,602 --> 00:41:06,901
- [Door closes]
- What do you want?

522
00:41:06,936 --> 00:41:09,267
Uh, a little bit of money,

523
00:41:09,302 --> 00:41:11,551
a bag of herb...

524
00:41:11,586 --> 00:41:13,510
and the truth.

525
00:41:13,545 --> 00:41:15,399
That's about it.

526
00:41:15,434 --> 00:41:18,968
- I don't know what
you're talking about.
- Okay, cool. Exactly.

527
00:41:19,003 --> 00:41:22,167
- What?
- All the shit that's
missing from my house.

528
00:41:22,202 --> 00:41:25,499
- Where the fuck is it?
- I was out.

529
00:41:25,534 --> 00:41:29,884
- I wasn't at your house.
- Yeah, I noticed. He's cute.

530
00:41:29,919 --> 00:41:34,199
- He is none of your business.
- Okay, then take his money.

531
00:41:34,234 --> 00:41:37,300
- Don't come in my house,
in my face...
- Then don't come in my house!

532
00:41:37,335 --> 00:41:41,767
I didn't go in your house
and take your shit, okay?

533
00:41:41,802 --> 00:41:44,165
I don't have anything of yours.

534
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:48,400
You have my car, that you
like to drive around town,
that you're so happy with.

535
00:41:48,435 --> 00:41:51,200
- I need the damn car, okay?
- You don't think I need it?

536
00:41:51,235 --> 00:41:52,933
I take Jesse around,
I take her out shopping,

537
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:55,601
buying her fucking Happy Meals,
all that good shit.

538
00:41:55,636 --> 00:41:57,718
But I can't do it
without my damn money.

539
00:41:57,753 --> 00:42:00,127
- I don't have your money.
- Okay...

540
00:42:00,162 --> 00:42:02,466
I don't have your
fucking money, Jake!

541
00:42:02,501 --> 00:42:04,834
It's not here.
You can look around.
There's no money.

542
00:42:04,869 --> 00:42:07,332
I have no money,
and I have no weed.

543
00:42:07,367 --> 00:42:09,998
- You're childish.
- You are such a fucking baby.

544
00:42:10,033 --> 00:42:14,100
It's all about Jake.
What Jake wants,
what Jake needs.

545
00:42:14,135 --> 00:42:17,132
- I don't have your shit!
- I need my money.

546
00:42:17,167 --> 00:42:21,300
- Go sell some of your shit
and make some money.
- It's the stupid principle!

547
00:42:21,335 --> 00:42:23,965
Principle of what?
You coming into my house,

548
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,200
banging on my door
late at night,
accusing me of shit?

549
00:42:29,334 --> 00:42:31,367
You need to pick my shit
off the floor.

550
00:42:31,402 --> 00:42:33,165
Pick it up
and give me my money.

551
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,150
Unless you spent it all.
At least did you spend it
on Jesse?

552
00:42:36,185 --> 00:42:39,100
- Huh? Did did you
buy her some clothes?
- Get out of my house.

553
00:42:40,667 --> 00:42:42,267
Oh, excuse me.

554
00:42:47,267 --> 00:42:49,332
- Was that Jesse's daddy?
- You know what?

555
00:42:49,367 --> 00:42:52,601
Martha, please, just
mind your own business, okay?

556
00:42:52,636 --> 00:42:54,334
Read your book.

557
00:43:33,834 --> 00:43:36,634
[TV playing]

558
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:58,933
Hello, Sergeant.
Detective Taylor.

559
00:43:58,968 --> 00:44:00,732
- Sgt. Davis.
- What do we got?

560
00:44:00,767 --> 00:44:03,599
We got a phone call at 6:45
from a neighbor

561
00:44:03,634 --> 00:44:06,866
stating that a child
had been crying
all night long.

562
00:44:06,901 --> 00:44:10,634
She couldn't get anybody
to answer the door,
so she called 911.

563
00:44:10,669 --> 00:44:12,566
We responded, made entry.

564
00:44:12,601 --> 00:44:16,167
Once inside, we found
a 23-year-old female
on the living room floor

565
00:44:16,202 --> 00:44:18,368
by the name
of Rose Hilliard.

566
00:44:18,403 --> 00:44:20,668
Okay.
Any sign of forced entry?

567
00:44:20,703 --> 00:44:22,934
- No sign.
- Any sign of robbery?

568
00:44:22,969 --> 00:44:24,699
Doesn't appear to be.

569
00:44:24,734 --> 00:44:28,534
- What about a struggle?
- Appears to be a struggle, yes.

570
00:44:28,569 --> 00:44:30,701
- Let's go and take a look.
- Okay.

571
00:44:35,634 --> 00:44:37,334
Dad, I've got your breakfast.

572
00:44:37,369 --> 00:44:39,899
Well, how nice of you.

573
00:44:39,934 --> 00:44:41,734
What are we having,
cereal this morning?

574
00:44:41,769 --> 00:44:43,334
Yeah. Cereal and some juice.

575
00:44:52,267 --> 00:44:57,033
Well, you're right, Sarge.
There's no sign of forced
entry into the apartment.

576
00:44:57,068 --> 00:45:01,501
Doesn't look like a robbery.
Her valuables and her purse
are still here.

577
00:45:05,133 --> 00:45:09,200
She's got bruising to the neck,
which is consistent with
manual strangulation.

578
00:45:09,235 --> 00:45:11,499
She's got petechiae
hemorrhage of the eyes.

579
00:45:11,534 --> 00:45:13,968
- Where's the baby?
- Baby's with the grandmother.

580
00:45:14,003 --> 00:45:15,965
- So the baby's safe?
- Yes.

581
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,965
Ross, when you're doing
the fingerprints,

582
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,000
I want you to process
the bruising on her neck
for prints.

583
00:45:22,035 --> 00:45:23,666
Okay, sir.

584
00:45:23,701 --> 00:45:26,367
What did we find out from
the neighborhood canvass?

585
00:45:26,402 --> 00:45:28,167
Officer Smeeks?

586
00:45:31,868 --> 00:45:34,534
You wanna fill the detective
in on what you know?

587
00:45:34,569 --> 00:45:37,200
Okay. Now, I spoke to
three of the neighbors.

588
00:45:45,367 --> 00:45:49,267
Hey, Mom, you didn't
happen to pick up any
money in my room, did you?

589
00:45:49,302 --> 00:45:51,884
No, I didn't.
I haven't been in your room.

590
00:45:51,919 --> 00:45:54,432
- Didn't see in your room.
- All right.

591
00:45:54,467 --> 00:45:56,432
Maybe you spent more than
you thought you did.

592
00:45:56,467 --> 00:46:01,133
I had a little bit saved up,
so I might have misplaced it
or something.

593
00:46:01,168 --> 00:46:04,033
I was checking if you were
in there and picked it up.

594
00:46:04,068 --> 00:46:07,167
No, haven't been in there.
Haven't seen it.

595
00:46:07,202 --> 00:46:08,566
Was it a lot of money?

596
00:46:08,601 --> 00:46:11,167
No, just a little
I had saved up
for an emergency.

597
00:46:26,801 --> 00:46:31,132
This is a ring that
my mother had given me.

598
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:34,434
When I turned 30,
she said I'd be responsible
enough to take care of it.

599
00:46:34,469 --> 00:46:36,299
Okay, so it's pretty
sentimental, huh?

600
00:46:36,334 --> 00:46:39,834
Yeah, it is, and this is
my grandmother's broach,

601
00:46:39,869 --> 00:46:41,866
and that was handed down
through the family,

602
00:46:41,901 --> 00:46:45,601
and my mother thought
she had gotten that,
but I got it.

603
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:47,501
You'll never guess
where this came from.

604
00:46:47,536 --> 00:46:48,566
Where's that?

605
00:46:48,601 --> 00:46:51,132
I found this in the park
with a metal detector.

606
00:46:51,167 --> 00:46:54,234
- Oh, wow. Nice find.
- I thought that was
pretty good.

607
00:47:12,567 --> 00:47:15,400
Jake? I'm Det. Taylor
from the police department.

608
00:47:15,435 --> 00:47:18,234
I need to talk to you
for a minute. Can I come in?

609
00:47:18,269 --> 00:47:20,018
Uh, is it necessary?

610
00:47:20,053 --> 00:47:21,732
It's kind of important.

611
00:47:21,767 --> 00:47:24,834
It's about Rose Hilliard.
I need to talk to you about her.

612
00:47:24,869 --> 00:47:26,868
All right, man.
Come on in.

613
00:47:28,467 --> 00:47:30,599
Right through this door.

614
00:47:30,634 --> 00:47:35,234
- Did you do this on the walls?
- Yeah, yeah, most of it.

615
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:36,818
Very interesting.

616
00:47:36,853 --> 00:47:38,332
Some would say.

617
00:47:38,367 --> 00:47:39,899
How long have you known Rose?

618
00:47:39,934 --> 00:47:43,750
Oh, man, I've known her
for a while, like...

619
00:47:43,785 --> 00:47:47,532
We were together for at least
a year and a half.

620
00:47:47,567 --> 00:47:50,868
Probably altogether,
I guess five years,
somewhere around there.

621
00:47:50,903 --> 00:47:53,852
Okay. I guess you share
a child together?

622
00:47:53,887 --> 00:47:56,801
- Yeah.
- What's your daughter's name?

623
00:47:56,836 --> 00:47:58,532
- Jesse.
- Okay.

624
00:47:58,567 --> 00:48:01,234
So when was the last time
you saw Rose?

625
00:48:01,269 --> 00:48:03,666
Oh, man. Uh...

626
00:48:03,701 --> 00:48:06,534
- What day is today?
- Saturday.

627
00:48:06,569 --> 00:48:08,899
Uh, just last night.

628
00:48:08,934 --> 00:48:11,367
- So it was last night
you were over there?
- Yeah, yeah, Friday night.

629
00:48:11,402 --> 00:48:13,834
Do you remember
about what time that was?

630
00:48:13,869 --> 00:48:15,998
Like 11 something.

631
00:48:16,033 --> 00:48:18,834
It was later, man,
like she was coming
from a date.

632
00:48:18,869 --> 00:48:21,632
Why did you go over there?

633
00:48:21,667 --> 00:48:25,533
Because, man, she's ignorant,
and she stole money of mine.

634
00:48:25,568 --> 00:48:29,365
- Did you get to talk to her?
- Yeah, I talked to her.

635
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,801
Was there anybody else
there at the house
when you were there?

636
00:48:31,836 --> 00:48:35,167
Uh, I remember she had
some chick on the couch.

637
00:48:35,202 --> 00:48:37,767
Do you know
who that person was?

638
00:48:37,802 --> 00:48:39,432
No, not a clue.

639
00:48:39,467 --> 00:48:41,801
Okay.
What did she look like?

640
00:48:43,467 --> 00:48:46,050
Uh, looked like
a person on a couch, man.
I don't know.

641
00:48:46,085 --> 00:48:48,599
- So you didn't pay
much attention to her?
- No, man.

642
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:52,234
Okay. Did you confront Rose
about her taking money from you?

643
00:48:52,269 --> 00:48:54,367
- Hell yeah.
- Did you get into an argument?

644
00:48:54,402 --> 00:48:57,032
Uh...

645
00:48:57,067 --> 00:49:00,367
I don't know.
That's just kind of
how we talk nowadays.

646
00:49:00,402 --> 00:49:01,933
- Just tell me...
- Yeah, yeah, man!

647
00:49:01,968 --> 00:49:03,801
She took my money.
I wanted my money back.

648
00:49:03,836 --> 00:49:05,232
Okay.

649
00:49:05,267 --> 00:49:07,232
She wasn't about
to give it to me,

650
00:49:07,267 --> 00:49:10,300
or just even
give me satisfaction
of admitting she did it.

651
00:49:10,335 --> 00:49:13,051
Did you guys get into
a screaming match?

652
00:49:13,086 --> 00:49:15,767
No, man. The kid was
sleeping upstairs.

653
00:49:15,802 --> 00:49:17,100
So what happened?

654
00:49:17,135 --> 00:49:19,766
Uh... We...

655
00:49:19,801 --> 00:49:22,132
I went in and asked her,
"Where's my money?"

656
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:27,100
Like usual, she told me,
"I don't have it.
I didn't take it."

657
00:49:27,135 --> 00:49:29,901
She said, "Get the hell
out of my house," and I left.

658
00:49:29,936 --> 00:49:32,400
Do you have any idea
why I'm here?

659
00:49:32,435 --> 00:49:33,432
No, man.

660
00:49:33,467 --> 00:49:36,100
Rose was murdered.

661
00:49:36,135 --> 00:49:38,532
Whoa. Okay.

662
00:49:38,567 --> 00:49:40,567
Do you have any knowledge
about who did that?

663
00:49:40,602 --> 00:49:43,232
No, not me.
I know that much.

664
00:49:43,267 --> 00:49:47,267
From looking around your
apartment, I can tell you're
a very passionate individual.

665
00:49:47,302 --> 00:49:48,899
- Artistic and passionate.
- [Laughs]

666
00:49:48,934 --> 00:49:51,032
Not passionate to beat
her ass or anything,

667
00:49:51,067 --> 00:49:53,501
otherwise you probably
would've heard of me
a long time ago.

668
00:49:53,536 --> 00:49:55,501
You've never been physical
with her in the past?

669
00:49:55,536 --> 00:49:57,299
No, man, not really.

670
00:49:57,334 --> 00:49:59,767
So when you left,
she was alive and
everything was fine?

671
00:49:59,802 --> 00:50:02,065
Well, I wouldn't say
everything was fine,

672
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:05,833
but she seemed to breathe
and speak and move about.

673
00:50:05,868 --> 00:50:10,300
So while you were there,
you didn't get into any kind of
physical altercation with her.

674
00:50:10,335 --> 00:50:12,300
No, man! So you're...
She's dead?

675
00:50:12,335 --> 00:50:14,551
She's dead.

676
00:50:14,586 --> 00:50:16,767
Wow, man.

677
00:50:18,567 --> 00:50:21,634
Wow. I need...
I need to call
some people, man.

678
00:50:21,669 --> 00:50:23,567
I need to see
my daughter.

679
00:50:36,133 --> 00:50:39,534
The darker the water,
the darker the bait,

680
00:50:39,569 --> 00:50:42,098
which doesn't
make any sense at all,

681
00:50:42,133 --> 00:50:46,767
but if the water you're
going to be fishing in
is real clear,

682
00:50:46,802 --> 00:50:48,499
you'll want
the lighter colors.

683
00:50:48,534 --> 00:50:52,098
...for the spinner rates,
and they lock down.

684
00:50:52,133 --> 00:50:55,767
And then there's little boxes
that you can put
whatever you please.

685
00:50:55,802 --> 00:50:59,467
Hey, that is nice.
And how much does this run?

686
00:50:59,502 --> 00:51:00,934
$18.95.

687
00:51:12,267 --> 00:51:13,766
[Knocking]

688
00:51:13,801 --> 00:51:16,365
- Kyle?
- Yeah.

689
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,232
I think you better
come out here.

690
00:51:18,267 --> 00:51:20,501
- Somebody wants to see you.
- All right.

691
00:51:20,536 --> 00:51:21,667
It's a cop.

692
00:51:28,467 --> 00:51:30,634
How long
have you known Rose?

693
00:51:30,669 --> 00:51:32,766
Oh, probably about
a week now.

694
00:51:32,801 --> 00:51:35,801
Okay, and what's
your relationship with her?

695
00:51:35,836 --> 00:51:38,801
Well, we worked together,
and we were friends.

696
00:51:38,836 --> 00:51:42,965
Uh, you know,
we just met, so...

697
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,601
- When was the last time
you saw Rose?
- I was with her last night.

698
00:51:46,636 --> 00:51:48,499
Okay. What did you guys do?

699
00:51:48,534 --> 00:51:51,466
We went out
for a couple beers,

700
00:51:51,501 --> 00:51:54,267
and we came back here
for a little bit,

701
00:51:54,302 --> 00:51:56,732
then I took her home.

702
00:51:56,767 --> 00:51:58,968
Was anybody else
with you last night?

703
00:51:59,003 --> 00:52:00,965
- No.
- Okay.

704
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,133
About what time did you
drop her off home last night?

705
00:52:04,168 --> 00:52:06,532
It was probably
around 11:00.

706
00:52:06,567 --> 00:52:09,132
Okay. During the time
that you were together,

707
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:14,067
did she express any concerns
that someone might want
to hurt her?

708
00:52:14,102 --> 00:52:16,067
[Kyle's mother]
Something happen to her?

709
00:52:16,102 --> 00:52:18,467
Yeah. She was murdered
last night.

710
00:52:19,968 --> 00:52:22,717
- What?
- She was murdered.

711
00:52:22,752 --> 00:52:25,432
- Where?
- At her home.

712
00:52:25,467 --> 00:52:27,601
Do you know of anybody
that would want to hurt her?

713
00:52:27,636 --> 00:52:31,067
No. She didn't
say anything.

714
00:52:32,801 --> 00:52:36,234
When you say you picked her...
What time did you pick
her up last night?

715
00:52:36,269 --> 00:52:40,432
Um, it was probably
about 7:00. 6:00 or 7:00.

716
00:52:40,467 --> 00:52:43,901
Did you go into her house
when you stopped to pick her up?

717
00:52:43,936 --> 00:52:44,933
Yeah, I went in.

718
00:52:44,968 --> 00:52:46,599
Was there anybody else there?

719
00:52:46,634 --> 00:52:49,400
Yeah. Martha was there.
She was babysitting for her.

720
00:52:49,435 --> 00:52:50,599
Who's Martha?

721
00:52:50,634 --> 00:52:55,067
She's another girl
I work with.

722
00:52:55,102 --> 00:52:57,000
Does she have red hair?

723
00:52:57,035 --> 00:52:58,334
Yeah.

724
00:53:10,334 --> 00:53:13,968
[Martha] And then I also
sew some doll clothes.

725
00:53:15,334 --> 00:53:16,699
You do what?

726
00:53:16,734 --> 00:53:19,934
I sew doll clothes
in the evenings
for the dolls.

727
00:53:19,969 --> 00:53:22,068
- Really?
- Yeah.

728
00:53:22,103 --> 00:53:24,132
It's a lot of fun.

729
00:53:24,167 --> 00:53:26,133
You do that with anybody
or just by yourself?

730
00:53:26,168 --> 00:53:27,833
Just by myself.

731
00:53:27,868 --> 00:53:31,534
My dad's at home,
and that way I just
spend some time with him.

732
00:53:31,569 --> 00:53:33,901
He usually watches TV
while I sew.

733
00:53:33,936 --> 00:53:34,901
[Chuckles]

734
00:54:04,467 --> 00:54:06,534
- Hi.
- Hi.

735
00:54:06,569 --> 00:54:08,566
Is Kyle here?

736
00:54:08,601 --> 00:54:11,384
- Yeah.
- Care if I come in?

737
00:54:11,419 --> 00:54:13,859
- Come on in.
- How you doing?

738
00:54:13,894 --> 00:54:16,300
I'm okay.
How are you doing?

739
00:54:16,335 --> 00:54:18,365
Terrific.

740
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:20,767
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

741
00:54:20,802 --> 00:54:22,300
Okay.

742
00:54:27,033 --> 00:54:29,165
That's nice.

743
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:31,550
Hang on. I'll get Kyle.

744
00:54:31,585 --> 00:54:33,892
Kyle, Martha's here.

745
00:54:33,927 --> 00:54:36,200
- Oh.
- I don't know.

746
00:54:37,734 --> 00:54:40,232
- Hi. What are you doing?
- Hey, Martha.

747
00:54:40,267 --> 00:54:43,683
- I've been trying
to get ahold of you.
- I've been out all day.

748
00:54:43,718 --> 00:54:47,100
I went to the beauty parlor and
went and bought a couple things.

749
00:54:47,135 --> 00:54:49,934
- Has anybody talked to you yet?
- About what?

750
00:54:49,969 --> 00:54:51,899
About Rose.

751
00:54:51,934 --> 00:54:53,998
What about Rose?

752
00:54:54,033 --> 00:54:56,866
She was killed
last night.

753
00:54:56,901 --> 00:55:01,200
She was murdered last night.
She was strangled.

754
00:55:01,235 --> 00:55:02,466
- No.
- Yes.

755
00:55:02,501 --> 00:55:05,067
- Last night?
- Yeah.

756
00:55:05,102 --> 00:55:06,165
Oh, my God.

757
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:08,483
[Mother] There was
a detective here today.

758
00:55:08,518 --> 00:55:11,676
[Martha]
You have got to be kidding me.

759
00:55:11,711 --> 00:55:14,834
Yeah. He just came in today
and told us.

760
00:55:14,869 --> 00:55:16,484
He asked me
a bunch of questions.

761
00:55:16,519 --> 00:55:18,100
And this happened
last night.

762
00:55:18,135 --> 00:55:20,599
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

763
00:55:20,634 --> 00:55:24,367
Yeah, they were asking me
because they thought I was
the last one that seen her.

764
00:55:24,402 --> 00:55:28,100
- Then I told him you were...
- Well, you brought her home
when I was there.

765
00:55:28,135 --> 00:55:29,132
Yeah.

766
00:55:29,167 --> 00:55:31,833
You are not gonna
believe this.

767
00:55:31,868 --> 00:55:37,000
When I was there last night
after you dropped her off,

768
00:55:37,035 --> 00:55:40,232
this guy started
beating on the door,

769
00:55:40,267 --> 00:55:45,567
and she goes to the door
and she opens it up,
and he comes in.

770
00:55:45,602 --> 00:55:48,199
He came in
screaming and yelling.

771
00:55:48,234 --> 00:55:50,968
She was okay when you left.
I mean, she was by herself.

772
00:55:51,003 --> 00:55:54,199
She was fine, yeah.
When I left, she was fine.

773
00:55:54,234 --> 00:55:59,234
But if he was waiting out there
when you dropped her off,

774
00:55:59,269 --> 00:56:01,485
he was probably
waiting on me to leave.

775
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:03,701
- Yeah.
- And he went back in there.

776
00:56:03,736 --> 00:56:05,634
Oh, my God.

777
00:56:07,334 --> 00:56:09,965
I can't even imagine.

778
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,133
I know.
It happened too fast.

779
00:56:13,168 --> 00:56:14,933
I know.

780
00:56:14,968 --> 00:56:17,701
Well, I got these
for you.

781
00:56:17,736 --> 00:56:20,100
Oh, well, thank you.

782
00:56:21,868 --> 00:56:23,351
Thank you, Martha.

783
00:56:23,386 --> 00:56:24,799
You're quite welcome.

784
00:56:24,834 --> 00:56:27,667
Yeah, definitely,
you have to call
this detective too.

785
00:56:27,702 --> 00:56:29,801
Oh, I will. You'll have to
give me the number.

786
00:56:29,836 --> 00:56:34,067
[Police scanner]

787
00:57:14,267 --> 00:57:16,399
- Hi. How you doin'?
- Hello, Martha.

788
00:57:16,434 --> 00:57:18,399
I'm Det. Taylor from
the police department.

789
00:57:18,434 --> 00:57:20,901
I need to talk to you about
Rose Hilliard. Can I come in?

790
00:57:20,936 --> 00:57:23,332
Oh, sure. Come on in.

791
00:57:23,367 --> 00:57:25,766
I heard from Kyle today,
and he was telling me

792
00:57:25,801 --> 00:57:29,100
that something horrible
had happened to Rose,
that she'd been murdered.

793
00:57:29,135 --> 00:57:32,265
- Can I come in and have a seat?
- Sure. This is my father.

794
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:35,267
Sir, I'm from the police
department. I was just here
to talk to your daughter.

795
00:57:35,302 --> 00:57:37,199
- Pleased to meet you.
- Pleased to meet you, sir.

796
00:57:37,234 --> 00:57:41,200
I mean, at first I thought
she was a really sweet girl.

797
00:57:41,235 --> 00:57:43,399
And then the longer
you get to know her,

798
00:57:43,434 --> 00:57:47,350
the pushier she gets and
the more favors she asks for.

799
00:57:47,385 --> 00:57:51,267
I mean, it was just one favor
right after the other one.

800
00:57:51,302 --> 00:57:53,734
Did you feel like she
took advantage of you?

801
00:57:53,769 --> 00:57:55,299
A little bit, yeah.

802
00:57:55,334 --> 00:57:57,499
Did she do that
to other people?

803
00:57:57,534 --> 00:58:01,133
I'm not really sure.
It seemed like she
picked on me a lot.

804
00:58:01,168 --> 00:58:05,000
She didn't really buddy up
with the other employees.

805
00:58:05,035 --> 00:58:07,499
She'd only been there a week.

806
00:58:07,534 --> 00:58:10,199
Well, in talking with
the witnesses in the area,

807
00:58:10,234 --> 00:58:13,968
they indicate that you were
the last one that was seen
leaving the residence.

808
00:58:15,033 --> 00:58:18,065
[Martha]
Well, I-I know that...

809
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:20,701
Well, I-I don't know.
I probably was.

810
00:58:20,736 --> 00:58:22,933
I left after he did.

811
00:58:22,968 --> 00:58:26,367
And that fact that, as far as
the investigation is concerned,

812
00:58:26,402 --> 00:58:29,567
you were the last one that
we know that saw her alive.

813
00:58:29,602 --> 00:58:30,965
Okay.

814
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,265
At some point, I would like
to get fingerprints from you

815
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:36,334
to be able to compare
to evidence that we
collected at the scene.

816
00:58:36,369 --> 00:58:38,400
Well, you know my fingerprints
are gonna be there.

817
00:58:38,435 --> 00:58:39,566
I was there.

818
00:58:39,601 --> 00:58:42,267
Right, but there's other
evidence that we have

819
00:58:42,302 --> 00:58:44,899
- that would only be
the killer's.
- Okay.

820
00:58:44,934 --> 00:58:47,534
Would you be willing to come
to the police department tonight

821
00:58:47,569 --> 00:58:48,899
and give me
a set of fingerprints?

822
00:58:48,934 --> 00:58:54,000
Okay. I would have to get
someone to take care of my dad.

823
00:58:54,035 --> 00:58:55,965
And about how long
will that take?

824
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,567
Shouldn't take
more than 15, 20 minutes

825
00:58:57,602 --> 00:58:59,599
- to get the fingerprints.
- Okay.

826
00:58:59,634 --> 00:59:02,267
If you'd be able to do it
tonight, it'd really help
with the investigation.

827
00:59:02,302 --> 00:59:04,801
I'll do anything I can to help.

828
00:59:59,033 --> 01:00:01,883
- Hello, Martha.
- Detective.

829
01:00:01,918 --> 01:00:04,699
Thanks for meeting
with me again.

830
01:00:04,734 --> 01:00:07,901
I just got a few more questions
that we need to talk about,

831
01:00:07,936 --> 01:00:09,866
- if that's okay.
- Okay.

832
01:00:09,901 --> 01:00:12,367
Do you care if I record
our conversation?

833
01:00:12,402 --> 01:00:14,032
- No.
- Okay.

834
01:00:14,067 --> 01:00:17,499
I'll just go ahead
and start the tape.

835
01:00:17,534 --> 01:00:21,868
What I like for you to do
is go over the events again
with me of Friday night.

836
01:00:21,903 --> 01:00:24,567
Do you remember about what time
Kyle came to the house?

837
01:00:24,602 --> 01:00:25,566
No, I don't.

838
01:00:25,601 --> 01:00:27,601
Okay.
Did Kyle come inside?

839
01:00:27,636 --> 01:00:28,833
Yes, he did.

840
01:00:28,868 --> 01:00:31,000
And did he stay
very long?

841
01:00:31,035 --> 01:00:32,901
No. They, uh...

842
01:00:34,801 --> 01:00:38,000
They talked a little bit,
and, um...

843
01:00:40,734 --> 01:00:42,332
They weren't there very long.

844
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:45,232
- Do you know where they went?
- No, I don't.

845
01:00:45,267 --> 01:00:49,334
Okay, so when they left,
it was just you
and the small child.

846
01:00:49,369 --> 01:00:53,067
- Yes.
- And what did you do
that evening?

847
01:00:53,102 --> 01:00:54,732
The child and I just played,

848
01:00:54,767 --> 01:00:58,499
and then I watched some TV
and read some books

849
01:00:58,534 --> 01:01:03,632
and gave her some juice,
and she went right to sleep.

850
01:01:03,667 --> 01:01:07,934
Rose had told me that it
wouldn't take her very long,
and she was very good.

851
01:01:07,969 --> 01:01:10,385
Okay. Nothing unusual
happened then?

852
01:01:10,420 --> 01:01:12,801
- No.
- What time did Rose come home?

853
01:01:12,836 --> 01:01:15,998
It was close to 11:00.

854
01:01:16,033 --> 01:01:19,599
Okay, and did you
immediately leave or...

855
01:01:19,634 --> 01:01:24,701
No. When she came in,
we sat down and she
asked me how Jesse was,

856
01:01:24,736 --> 01:01:27,701
and I asked her
about her date.

857
01:01:27,736 --> 01:01:29,532
And, uh...

858
01:01:29,567 --> 01:01:33,000
Then, of course,
that man came to the door.

859
01:01:33,035 --> 01:01:36,434
Yeah, you told me
that an individual came.

860
01:01:36,469 --> 01:01:37,767
- Yes.
- It was her ex-boyfriend?

861
01:01:37,802 --> 01:01:38,998
Right. He had been...

862
01:01:39,033 --> 01:01:44,567
I guess he had been sitting
outside waiting on her.

863
01:01:44,602 --> 01:01:47,466
- And did they argue?
- Yes, they sure did.

864
01:01:47,501 --> 01:01:49,501
You told me that they had
gotten into an argument.

865
01:01:49,536 --> 01:01:52,632
Again, tell me
what that was about.

866
01:01:52,667 --> 01:01:56,200
He had said that she had stole
some things from the apartment

867
01:01:56,235 --> 01:01:59,866
and some money.

868
01:01:59,901 --> 01:02:04,434
How did it end with them?
Did it turn physical?

869
01:02:04,469 --> 01:02:07,667
Well, there was
a lot of yelling and...

870
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:12,866
I'm not sure
whether he shoved her,

871
01:02:12,901 --> 01:02:16,300
but I know she had
grabbed ahold of him
to try to get him out the door.

872
01:02:16,335 --> 01:02:19,400
Was she able to get him
out of the house?

873
01:02:19,435 --> 01:02:21,732
It took awhile.

874
01:02:21,767 --> 01:02:26,033
Okay. But he did
ultimately leave
the apartment.

875
01:02:26,068 --> 01:02:27,466
Yes. Yes, he did.

876
01:02:27,501 --> 01:02:30,467
Did you see him any more
that night?

877
01:02:30,502 --> 01:02:32,899
No. I didn't...

878
01:02:32,934 --> 01:02:35,332
I just got in my car and left.

879
01:02:35,367 --> 01:02:37,734
Okay, and where did you go
when you left?

880
01:02:37,769 --> 01:02:40,632
- I went straight home.
- Okay.

881
01:02:40,667 --> 01:02:42,998
And I spoke to your dad
the night that we talked,

882
01:02:43,033 --> 01:02:47,601
and he said you came home
about the same time
that you're saying.

883
01:02:47,636 --> 01:02:49,132
Um...

884
01:02:49,167 --> 01:02:53,000
Is there anything else
that you can tell me
at this point?

885
01:02:53,035 --> 01:02:56,734
Well, the thing that,
you know, really bothers me

886
01:02:56,769 --> 01:03:00,434
is that he was waiting outside
on her to get home.

887
01:03:00,469 --> 01:03:01,833
Uh-huh.

888
01:03:01,868 --> 01:03:04,399
So what if he was still there
after I left?

889
01:03:04,434 --> 01:03:08,332
Okay. Do you remember
when we talked at your house

890
01:03:08,367 --> 01:03:13,000
and you indicated to me that
you'd do anything you could to
help with this investigation?

891
01:03:13,035 --> 01:03:14,833
Yes, I did.

892
01:03:14,868 --> 01:03:18,734
Well, what you need to do is
start telling me the truth
about what happened.

893
01:03:18,769 --> 01:03:20,032
So I am.

894
01:03:20,067 --> 01:03:24,083
We have got the physical
evidence back from the lab,

895
01:03:24,118 --> 01:03:28,100
and it implicates you in
the death of Rose Hilliard.

896
01:03:28,135 --> 01:03:30,933
I don't see how. How?

897
01:03:30,968 --> 01:03:36,234
Your fingerprints were
lifted off the bruises
around her neck.

898
01:03:36,269 --> 01:03:39,265
I don't understand it.

899
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:43,567
Now, Martha, this is
the opportunity for you
to help yourself here.

900
01:03:43,602 --> 01:03:46,301
Now, either you are
a cold-blooded killer,

901
01:03:46,336 --> 01:03:48,965
- which I don't think
is the case...
- No.

902
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:53,634
Or something happened
in that apartment that
caused you to do this.

903
01:03:53,669 --> 01:03:57,085
There is no doubt
that you did this. None.

904
01:03:57,120 --> 01:04:00,501
But only you can
explain to me
what happened,

905
01:04:00,536 --> 01:04:02,868
and I want you
to do that.

906
01:04:07,801 --> 01:04:11,299
I can't. I just...
I don't know.

907
01:04:11,334 --> 01:04:16,767
Is there any way that you can
explain your fingerprints
around her neck?

908
01:04:16,802 --> 01:04:19,699
No, sir. No, sir.

909
01:04:19,734 --> 01:04:21,801
And the neighbors saw you
leave the apartment.

910
01:04:21,836 --> 01:04:23,833
You were the last one
to leave the apartment.

911
01:04:23,868 --> 01:04:27,534
The evidence is there.
You will be convicted of this.

912
01:04:27,569 --> 01:04:31,200
You need to tell me the truth
about what happened.

913
01:04:36,234 --> 01:04:38,699
I don't know.
I-I don't know.

914
01:04:38,734 --> 01:04:41,017
Well, the jury's not
going to believe that.

915
01:04:41,052 --> 01:04:43,265
I want you to look
at these photographs.

916
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:48,132
That what she looks like.
That's what you did you her.

917
01:04:48,167 --> 01:04:52,834
A jury's not gonna have
sympathy for you if you don't
show some kind of remorse.

918
01:04:52,869 --> 01:04:55,799
Now, it can be explained
how this happened.

919
01:04:55,834 --> 01:04:58,601
Maybe you got into
an argument with her,
maybe things got out of hand.

920
01:04:58,636 --> 01:05:01,935
But only you know that.
She can't tell us.

921
01:05:01,970 --> 01:05:05,234
- I couldn't have done this.
- Well, you did.

922
01:05:05,269 --> 01:05:07,534
No, sir. No. No.

923
01:05:25,901 --> 01:05:30,100
Mr. Hightower, I wanted to
come over and talk to you and
let you know what's going on.

924
01:05:30,135 --> 01:05:32,732
Okay. I was
wondering about it.

925
01:05:32,767 --> 01:05:35,050
I just finished
talking with Martha,

926
01:05:35,085 --> 01:05:37,299
and based upon
my interview with her

927
01:05:37,334 --> 01:05:40,466
and evidence that we
recovered from the scene,

928
01:05:40,501 --> 01:05:43,734
she's been arrested for
the murder of Rose Hilliard.

929
01:05:43,769 --> 01:05:46,666
Is that right?

930
01:05:46,701 --> 01:05:50,167
And I wanted to come over
and make you aware of
what's going on

931
01:05:50,202 --> 01:05:52,567
because you
are her family.

932
01:05:52,602 --> 01:05:54,132
Yes.

933
01:05:54,167 --> 01:05:56,666
She's currently
at the jail

934
01:05:56,701 --> 01:06:01,000
and that's where she'll be
until there's a hearing date.

935
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,350
What the hell.
Sorry to hear it.

936
01:06:08,385 --> 01:06:10,576
Do you have
any questions for me?

937
01:06:10,611 --> 01:06:12,767
Do you know when
her hearing will be?

938
01:06:12,802 --> 01:06:16,299
It'll be fairly soon.

939
01:06:16,334 --> 01:06:19,100
And they will give her
an attorney.

940
01:06:42,968 --> 01:06:44,666
Hey, Martha.

941
01:06:44,701 --> 01:06:48,033
Hi, Kyle.
I'm really glad you came.
It's horrible in here.

942
01:06:48,068 --> 01:06:49,065
Yeah?

943
01:06:49,100 --> 01:06:51,032
So what's going on?

944
01:06:51,067 --> 01:06:53,165
I don't know.
I don't understand.

945
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:55,334
I don't even know
why I'm here, really.

946
01:06:55,369 --> 01:06:58,098
And they think
I killed her.

947
01:06:58,133 --> 01:07:02,834
Kyle, you know me.
You know I could not
have done that.

948
01:07:02,869 --> 01:07:07,766
I think... I really...
I think it's Jesse's dad.

949
01:07:07,801 --> 01:07:13,634
And I can't... I don't know.
I don't know what happened.

950
01:07:13,669 --> 01:07:15,199
You got to help me, Kyle.

951
01:07:15,234 --> 01:07:19,334
You know that
I would never do
anything like this.

952
01:07:19,369 --> 01:07:20,432
Yeah.

953
01:07:20,467 --> 01:07:23,499
I-I don't understand.

954
01:07:23,534 --> 01:07:25,965
And it seemed like
the detective...

955
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:31,367
They think that I did this,
and I don't see how.

956
01:07:31,402 --> 01:07:34,067
I don't see how
that can be right.

957
01:07:34,102 --> 01:07:36,232
I don't know, Martha.

958
01:07:36,267 --> 01:07:39,900
I don't understand it.
I don't know.

959
01:07:39,935 --> 01:07:43,499
I don't know what,
you know, what I did.

960
01:07:43,534 --> 01:07:47,350
I know that I had a really,
really, really bad headache,

961
01:07:47,385 --> 01:07:51,167
and when he started yelling,
I just wanted to go home.

962
01:07:51,202 --> 01:07:54,098
And I didn't know
who he was,

963
01:07:54,133 --> 01:07:57,750
and when I tried
to ask her who he was,

964
01:07:57,785 --> 01:08:01,576
she told me to
mind my own business.

965
01:08:01,611 --> 01:08:05,332
And that kind of
made me feel bad

966
01:08:05,367 --> 01:08:09,567
because, I thought, you know,
I thought I could talk to her
like a daughter.

967
01:08:09,602 --> 01:08:12,767
I mean, after all,
she left me with, you know,

968
01:08:12,802 --> 01:08:15,501
her most prized
possession: Her baby.

969
01:08:15,536 --> 01:08:17,165
Yeah.

970
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:19,098
And she's asked me for
all kinds of favors,

971
01:08:19,133 --> 01:08:23,367
and I just didn't think
it was too much to ask
who he was.

972
01:08:23,402 --> 01:08:27,601
And she was really mad
and didn't want
to talk about it.

973
01:08:29,968 --> 01:08:31,567
I don't know, Martha.

974
01:08:32,868 --> 01:08:35,418
You got to help me, Kyle.
You got to.

975
01:08:35,453 --> 01:08:37,968
I mean, I don't
what I can do, but...

976
01:08:39,100 --> 01:08:42,167
I... I don't know
how this happened.

977
01:08:42,202 --> 01:08:45,199
We have to figure this out.
We have to.

978
01:08:45,234 --> 01:08:49,901
I didn't do it, Kyle.
You know I wouldn't
do anything like that.

979
01:08:49,936 --> 01:08:51,599
Yeah.

980
01:08:51,634 --> 01:08:53,666
I don't know, Martha.

981
01:08:53,701 --> 01:08:57,801
- I just... I don't understand.
- I don't either.

982
01:09:02,467 --> 01:09:05,601
[TV playing]

983
01:09:15,334 --> 01:09:17,032
[Man]
Good morning, everyone.

984
01:09:17,067 --> 01:09:19,834
We've obviously gone through
a very tragic set of events.

985
01:09:19,869 --> 01:09:23,332
It is, um...

986
01:09:23,367 --> 01:09:27,132
But we need move on,
and because of that,

987
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:30,901
we have gone out and we have
hired Kyle's mom, Helen,

988
01:09:30,936 --> 01:09:32,466
with the idea that...

989
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:38,434
She can't take
the two ladies' place
because they are, you know...

990
01:09:38,469 --> 01:09:40,199
We had a longtime employee

991
01:09:40,234 --> 01:09:43,234
and we had a short-time employee
who was doing very well,

992
01:09:43,269 --> 01:09:46,199
but we feel like with, um...

993
01:09:46,234 --> 01:09:48,866
Even though Kyle's mom
