1
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:07,450
Follow my finger.

2
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:09,180
Adam.

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,370
Show me...

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,160
a bicycle.

5
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:20,560
Eyes here.

6
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,810
Adam.

7
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:30,520
Show me a bicycle.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,074

9
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:48,210
No, buddy, that's a ball.

10
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,160
Adam, look at me.

11
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:51,960
Are you hungry?

12
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:54,920
Show me what you want for lunch.

13
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:16,040
Still Drawing those lines instead of looking at the cards.

14
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,950
More juice?

15
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,290
If he wants more juice, he has to ask for it.

16
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:26,340
Adam.

17
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:27,870
Buddy, eyes here.

18
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,090
He's tired, Dom.

19
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:31,790
Wouldn't be if we stuck to the schedule.

20
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:35,340
Show me the juice, buddy.

21
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,170
I think we've reached the point of diminishing returns.

22
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:38,670
He has to ask for it.

23
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:40,060
Adam.

24
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:43,360
He's choking.

25
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,190
That's impossible. It's mac and cheese.

26
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,590
Ten-year-old boy, screams for his life for no reason.

27
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:30,520
He's autistic.

28
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,110
Severely autistic.

29
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,350
Can't talk, can't make eye contact.

30
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:37,690
Screaming's probably his way of communicating.

31
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,080
And he went to three different doctors who all said just that.

32
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,330
Well, so clearly, that can't be the answer.

33
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,760
His brain can't filter information.

34
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,500
It's a constant assault on his senses.

35
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,270
I'd scream too.

36
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,770
Or it's something medical sounding, like dysesthesia.

37
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:55,450
Parents are convinced that there's something wrong with their son.

38
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,860
Since when did we start believing parents?

39
00:02:58,860 --> 00:02:59,640
Or anyone?

40
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:00,960
Where are we going?

41
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:02,720
Elevator.

42
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,300
Dad was on wall street, mom was a partner in an accounting firm.

43
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,710
When their son was diagnosed with autism, they both quit.

44
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,300
So they're overprotective and scared.

45
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,850
That's all the more reason to discount-- they study this kid.

46
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,870
Heard him scream a million times.

47
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,950
But in ten years of caring for him, this is the first time they've brought him to a hospital.

48
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:20,310
E.R. checked his throat. No obstructions, nothing.

49
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,700
Which means the only symptom was a scream, which is diagnostic of nothing.

50
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,710
Kid clutched his chest, B.P. was elevated.

51
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:26,770
Maybe there was chest pain.

52
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,710
E.R. said the heart was fine.

53
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,360
Don't be so quick to dismiss pain.

54
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:31,310
Where are we going?

55
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:32,640
Down.

56
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,490
Stool sample to check for parasites.

57
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:36,120
Blood culture to rule out infection.

58
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:37,770
And ana for lupus.

59
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:39,180
Because he screamed?

60
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:41,240
Could also be an environmental reaction.

61
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,100
An allergy.

62
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,660
Dust, wheat, pollen.

63
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,660
A toxin, or something he ate-- check the house and run a lung ventilation scan.

64
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,190
Lungs are in the chest too, right?

65
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,120
I had a date last night.

66
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:49,770
She screamed.

67
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:51,660
Should we spend $100,000 testing her?

68
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,500
Of course not.

69
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,360
This isn't a veterinary hospital.

70
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:55,570
Zing!

71
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:58,570
Look, if you don't think this kid is worth saving-- that's not what I'm saying.

72
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:59,300
Well, it's too bad.

73
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,300
It's a good point.

74
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:02,450
Kid's just a lump with tonsils.

75
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:06,000
You know what it's gonna be like ,trying to put an autistic kid into a nuclear scanner?

76
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,950
I don't envy you guys.

77
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:14,030
I want my old carpet back.

78
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:16,720
we're gonna have to do this later.

79
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:17,660
A kid...

80
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,470
in the clinic had an accident.

81
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:24,390
Generally, when people are on the-- I wanty old carpet back.

82
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,750
It was stained with blood.

83
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,000
Yeah, my blood.

84
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,480
Which makes the carpet part of me.

85
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,550
I want it back.

86
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:30,690
I want to be buried with it.

87
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:34,780
You think you can get me to do anything you want, regardless of how stupid it is?

88
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,060
It's my office!

89
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,570
It's where I work. Where I think.

90
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:44,970
Where I save lives, allowing you to brag to rich people so they'll give you more money to spend on mris and low-cut tops.

91
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,560
I want it back the way it was.

92
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:49,230
It's identical to the old carpet.

93
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,660
Except without the hazardous biological waste.

94
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:57,840
I shall not return to my office until every patented durable micro fiber has been restored to its rightful place.

95
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,670
Inspiring.

96
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:02,330
You don't want to work in your office,work in the clinic.

97
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:03,860
You don't want to work in the clinic,go home.

98
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,440
And don't get paid.

99
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:11,330
Attica!

100
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,220
Attica?

101
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,300
He,uh,just needs to finish this level.

102
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,520
We only have the scanner up for the next half hour.

103
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,190
After that-- trust me.

104
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,710
You don't want to move him until he's finished.

105
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:32,130
Sooner we do this test,the sooner we can get you guys home.

106
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:40,070
Adam.

107
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:43,710
Do you think that-- that we--

108
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,730
Ten minutes,tops.

109
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:52,790
If he has a vascular disorder,he might not have that-- he might not have ten minutes?

110
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,270
I don't have ten minutes.

111
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:57,580
No,no,you don't-- want to do that--

112
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:59,500
Adam. Adam.

113
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:10,150
I used metamucil like the doctor told me and finally I was able to use the bathroom.

114
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:15,640
But I saw somethingin the toilet I couldn't identify.

115
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,730
I-I wrapped it in tissue paper --so you could take a look.

116
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,530
Couldn't you sedate him or something?

117
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,540
I could if I didn't want the test results to mean anything.

118
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:49,070
Painkillers, exercising.

119
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:51,510
We even did that puncture thing.

120
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:57,230
Nothing work then this morning, I get up, my back feels great.

121
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:00,680
I figured I'd betterget down here right away.

122
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,980
Big shocker-- Dad's depressed.

123
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:14,350
Save your time.

124
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:16,700
Ssris don't cause chest pain.

125
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,230
Every minute of every day is booked.

126
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:25,030
When he eats, sleeps, plays his handheld.

127
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:27,030
Not much of a life for them.

128
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,220
They chose to have a family.

129
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:31,000
You don't get to decide what your kid's gonna be like.

130
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,060
Nobody chooses this.

131
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,560
It's funny.

132
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:41,780
You get a normal kid, the parent works.

133
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:46,790
You get a special kid that costs more, they quit and turn the backyard into a therapy circuit.

134
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:49,290
Yes,if only you were handicapped.

135
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:52,130
All the good times you could've had with dad.

136
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,110
Hi, Dr. House.

137
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:15,370
Hello ,girl whose name I don't remember, but whose dad I treated, so I don't really know why she's here.

138
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,800
Ali.

139
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,420
Um, I think I caught what my dad has.

140
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:21,340
The rhino thing.

141
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,810
Right.

142
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:26,190
Does that hurt?

143
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,800
A little.

144
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,500
It's in my chest,too.

145
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:32,380
Of course it is.

146
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:44,180
Kinda had access through the shirt.

147
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,930
But... this'll work.

148
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,800
Feels good.

149
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:57,320
Exactly when did New Jersey run out of horny 17-year-old boys?

150
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,890
About five weeks ago.

151
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:02,410
It's been very lonely.

152
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,240
The ventilation scan was normal.

153
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,330
Time to send him home.

154
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:15,900
Can't leave right now.

155
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:17,030
Well, congratulations.

156
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:19,720
You are the proud owner of your very own rhino thing.

157
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,510
A rhinovirus-- you can't leave because she has a cold?

158
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:25,410
Can't leave because Cuddy says I can't leave.

159
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,780
All the tests are normal.

160
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,860
Okay, don't start with me.

161
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:34,390
We're backed up.

162
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:37,040
I know this is hard for all of us, but thanks to Dr. Cuddy,

163
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:38,170
I don't have an office.

164
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:39,170
So I have to work here.

165
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,800
What'd she do to your office?

166
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:42,590
It's unusable.

167
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:45,150
So whatever is bothering him, it wasn't his lungs.

168
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,080
What about the kid's house?

169
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,070
There were some pesticides and some alcohol, but the tox screen was negative.

170
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,490
Which means there's nothing physically wrong with this kid.

171
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,950
We already had that discussion.

172
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,290
We get a fecal smear?

173
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:56,070
Should we do this someplace else?

174
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:58,280
No, Cuddy says I have to work here.

175
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:02,390
No, I said you can work in your office or you had to work here.

176
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:04,890
And since I can't work in my office...

177
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:07,080
Is this your master plan?

178
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,980
Disrupt hospital business until I replace your carpet?

179
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:11,950
Devious.

180
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:13,830
Saw it in a James Bond movie.

181
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:15,140
Fecal smear!

182
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,220
- Talk to me.
- Get out of here.

183
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,990
- You'll put back my carpet?
- No.

184
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:19,810
Get out of here!

185
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,610
Fecal matter.

186
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,290
Is there a sample we can look at?

187
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,650
Parents have the smear kit.

188
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,080
The kid is constipated.

189
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,070
Do what you want.

190
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:28,390
Not replacing your carpet.

191
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:32,540
Go up his rear and get a smear.

192
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:35,250
Which reminds me, I kinda feel like a bagel.

193
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,680
Carpets.

194
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,600
We need a stool sample.

195
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,370
We should probably wait until he's finished playing that level, huh?

196
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:52,560
I actually think he's a bit better today.

197
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,200
He seems more like his old self.

198
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:56,270
It is possible that he was never sick.

199
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:59,460
I guess we, uh, could've overreacted.

200
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:15,990
So what makes fluid fill the lining of a kid's lungs?

201
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:16,860
Why are we in here?

202
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,930
Is this some sort of power play?

203
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:19,800
Yeah.

204
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:23,960
So you stuck your finger in the kid and gave him a pleural effusion.

205
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:26,100
You ever considered getting a manicure?

206
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,400
I took the stool sample after his lungs failed.

207
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,130
Or do you really have a problem with the carpeting?

208
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:33,200
Change sets you off-- I said it was a power play.

209
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:36,130
Someone answers "yes" to option A, you don't move on to option B.

210
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:38,710
If there's a pleural effusion, we have to rule out heart failure.

211
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:39,470
Why now?

212
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,060
Why a power play now?

213
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,910
I smelled weakness.

214
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:45,140
Get the kid an echocardiogram.

215
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,040
That's... funny.

216
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:58,380
It says "James Wilson." A strange typo.

217
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:03,620
If the fluid comes back an exudate, get him on broad-spectrum antibiotics.

218
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,530
Thank you for coming.

219
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:06,900
No problem.

220
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:10,010
Thought you wouldn't mind sharing offices for a while.

221
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:13,580
You share stories, feelings...

222
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,310
Toys.

223
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:17,030
You don't share offices.

224
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:19,530
That is so not zen.

225
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,900
It was a gift.

226
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:23,420
Some doctors get those.

227
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,770
So you want mornings or afternoons?

228
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:30,990
You couldn't make Cuddy miserable, so you're gonna make me miserable so I can make Cuddy miserable on your behalf?

229
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:31,810
Yeah.

230
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,860
What makes you think I can make her miserable?

231
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:35,060
Because you're good at that stuff.

232
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,130
Oh, I'm nothing compared to you.

233
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:38,410
Is there anything you'll throw out?

234
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:40,760
That's a gift from an 11-year-old patient of mine.

235
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,020
She and I both knew it was a piece of junk, and that's what made her laugh.

236
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:49,070
So you gotta keep it until she-- she already did.

237
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,280
Adam.

238
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,210
I need you to stay still, buddy.

239
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:02,660
it's okay, it's okay. I got him.

240
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,580
There we go.

241
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:09,150
Okay.

242
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,070
What?

243
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:19,480
What is it? Is his heart okay?

244
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,390
No.

245
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:28,510
Echo suggested a conduction abnormality.

246
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:30,020
EKG confirmed it.

247
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:32,280
Still doesn't explain the effusion.

248
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,380
The pleural fluid was an exudate.

249
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,430
We should be looking for something that explains both the heart and lung problems.

250
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:39,770
Infection, parasite, cancer.

251
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:44,090
Microbiology showed no organisms in the fluid, so forget infection.

252
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,880
It's not a power play.

253
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:50,540
Doing a differential in the clinic makes sense.

254
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:51,540
Piss Cuddy off.

255
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,720
Same thing with Wilson's office.

256
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,890
Works indirectly.

257
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,380
But now, we are in office space.

258
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:59,160
Because you don't want to be in your own office.

259
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:01,750
Which means this has nothing to do with Cuddy.

260
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,050
You really are obsessed with your carpets.

261
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:06,540
Which means-- What are you doing here?

262
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:09,170
I have this room booked from 2:00 to 3:00.

263
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,200
Oh, 2:00 east coast time.

264
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:15,080
I thought you meant Pacific.

265
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,010
Which is...

266
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,640
Stupid of me, I guess.

267
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:21,270
What about parasites?

268
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,780
Stool sample was negative.

269
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,950
It's 2:00.

270
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:26,420
Oh, well, we should go, then.

271
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:28,820
That just leaves cancer.

272
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,980
Get a lung biopsy.

273
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,810
It took a half an hour to get the mask on the kid for the lung scan.

274
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:33,630
Oh, I'm sorry.

275
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:36,020
Was there somewhere you needed to be?

276
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,400
House.

277
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:43,410
Can we talk?

278
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,200
- Carpet?
- Never.

279
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,660
Nothing to talk about.

280
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:54,860
Your girlfriend called the clinic 15 times looking for you today.

281
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:55,920
Lot to discuss.

282
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:57,120
China patterns-- House.

283
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,290
She's a stalker.

284
00:14:58,310 --> 00:14:59,220
Right.

285
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,870
Couldn't be that she finds me interesting.

286
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:01,770
Attractive.

287
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:02,860
Has to be that she's insane.

288
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,780
She's called you 15 times.

289
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,140
Your mother's not that interested in you.

290
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,190
Well, maybe I'd be better adjusted if she was.

291
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:10,340
- I'm notifying security.
- Is this about the carpet?

292
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,160
You think I'll back off if you block all my fun?

293
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,540
You better not be having fun.

294
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:14,350
I'm having fun.

295
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:15,320
I'm not having sex.

296
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,040
- She's dangerous.
- She's not dangerous.

297
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:17,910
She's pretty.

298
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:18,760
She's pretty.

299
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,080
Men are stupid.

300
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,040
I'm with you so far.

301
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,730
I'm notifying security.

302
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,430
Oh, give her a break.

303
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:26,830
She's not dangerous, she's...

304
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,340
insightful.

305
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:32,010
You can't stop our love!

306
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,760
Hey, you got a minute?

307
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:39,510
Yeah.

308
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:43,750
We have a ten-year-old with pleural effusion and conduction abnormality but no heart failure.

309
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:45,360
Was there a protein in the pleural fluid?

310
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:47,320
Yeah, that's why we're thinking cancer.

311
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,590
Non-hodgkin's, probably.

312
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,660
So we want to do a lung biopsy.

313
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:52,380
Lung biopsies usually come back negative.

314
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:54,500
So biopsy a lymph node under the arm.

315
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:56,960
That's probably something an oncologist should do, right?

316
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,200
There's nothing real tricky to it.

317
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,060
It's a biopsy.

318
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:02,710
Still, just to be safe, you mind?

319
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,900
For the love of god!

320
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:14,600
Can't somebody shut that kid up?

321
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:16,400
Some people are trying to work around here.

322
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:18,330
Why don't you show him a teddy bear or something?

323
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,250
Who are you?

324
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,150
Somebody you'll never send a a gift to.

325
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:22,330
This is Dr. House.

326
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:23,830
Your son's doctor.

327
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:25,760
High test, please.

328
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:28,670
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

329
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:34,160
Out of vicodin?

330
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,240
What are you doing?

331
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:39,300
Eating the red berries.

332
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,720
He trusted you.

333
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:10,030
No,that wasn't trust.

334
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:10,810
That was...

335
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:11,870
self-preservation.

336
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:12,580
No.

337
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:14,400
That was huge.

338
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,440
It was like a conversation.

339
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:23,530
A monk-- a monkey's afraid to eat the red berries until he sees another monkey eat them.

340
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,200
Monkey see, monkey do.

341
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,910
That's all it was.

342
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:31,350
Your kid's still just as messed up as when we admitted him.

343
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:45,320
That was sensitive.

344
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:48,330
You have pretty hair.

345
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,100
Hope is all those parents have going for them.

346
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:55,020
No, hope is what's making them miserable.

347
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:58,020
What they should do is get a cocker spaniel.

348
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:00,290
A dog would look them in the eye.

349
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:01,990
Wag his tail when he's happy.

350
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:03,760
Lick their face, show them love.

351
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,130
Is it so wrong for them to want to have a normal child?

352
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:08,120
It's normal to want to be normal.

353
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:11,170
Spoken likea true circle queen.

354
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,650
See, skinny, socially privileged white people get to draw this neat little circle.

355
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:19,500
And everyone inside the circle is normal.

356
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:25,760
Everyone outside the circle should be beaten, broken and reset so they can be brought into the circle.

357
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:28,290
Failing that, they should be institutionalized.

358
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:29,940
Or worse, pitied.

359
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,150
So it's wrong to feel sorry for this little boy?

360
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:36,360
Why would you feel sorry for someone who gets to opt out of the inane courteous formalities?

361
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:40,060
Which are utterly meaningless, insincere and therefore degrading?

362
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:46,550
This kid doesn't have to pretend to be interested in your back pain, or your excretions, or your grandma's itchy place.

363
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:52,610
Can you imagine how liberating it would be to live a life free of all the mind-numbing social niceties?

364
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,620
I don't pity this kid.

365
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,510
I envy him.

366
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:00,460
Uh, no cancer.

367
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:01,750
Because...

368
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:03,580
These aren't lymph cells.

369
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:05,290
Then what are they?

370
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:08,210
Liver cells.

371
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:19,280
Liver cells under his arm.

372
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:24,230
Wonder what he's got whereh is liver's supposed to be.

373
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:41,180
Anyone got a clue how liver cells got into the kid's armpit?

374
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:46,970
Make yourself at home.

375
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:51,020
So, you think maybe Grey's Anatomy got it all wrong?

376
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,680
Lymph system circulates fluid, not organ cells.

377
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,030
Cancer cells break into the lymphatic system all the time.

378
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:57,620
But we're not talking about cancer cells.

379
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:00,210
What's the difference between cancer cells and liver cells?

380
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:02,490
Why can one pass through walls but the other can't?

381
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:03,360
Cancer cells are damaged.

382
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,380
Lets them grow into blood vessels.

383
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,650
Go wherever they want.

384
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,140
So if the liver cells are damaged-- liver isn't damaged.

385
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:09,350
The tests were normal.

386
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:14,740
So if the liver cells are damaged, it's theoretically possible to pass into the lymphatic system.

387
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:17,860
Liver failure could also explain pleural effusion, even the heart issues.

388
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,060
Liver cells are fine.

389
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:24,680
He was immunized for hep A and B, and do you really think this kid is having unprotected sex or sharing needles?

390
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,130
Daddy does seem the type to use a rubber.

391
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,150
So it's not viral.

392
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:33,050
That just leaves "lotta-booze-irrhosis".

393
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:37,050
Our ten-year-old boy does not have a drinking problem or cirrhosis.

394
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:40,100
House, when we echoed his heart, we got a piece of his liver-- there was no scarring.

395
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,560
Cirrhosis explains the symptoms.

396
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:44,100
Heart problems, lungs-- look up "cirrhosis" in the dictionary.

397
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,230
It means "scarring".

398
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,680
Parents aren't doing or dosing this kid.

399
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:48,930
How would you know that?

400
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:50,150
Kid can't talk.

401
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:51,390
Why'd you think I took this case?

402
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,890
He's not gonna give away the ending.

403
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:54,430
They quit their jobs for him.

404
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:57,880
Yes, they are everything you'd want in a parent.

405
00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:01,050
Unfortunately, their kidis nothing you'd want.

406
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:03,950
When a baby is born, it's perfect.

407
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:06,070
Little fingers, little toes.

408
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:08,240
Plump, perfect, pink.

409
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:11,360
And brimming with unbridled potential.

410
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:12,950
But then it's downhill.

411
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:15,400
Some hills steeper than others.

412
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:19,890
Parents get off on their kids' accomplishments-- (toy)Bend over and relax.

413
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,100
Cute.

414
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:25,040
They'll annoy you with trophy rooms and report cards.

415
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:30,490
Hell, they'll even show you a purple cow and tell you what a keen eye for color their kid has.

416
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:38,960
But this kid...

417
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:42,170
He doesn't smile, he doesn't hug them, he doesn't laugh.

418
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:46,540
His parents get nothing-- the right to brag that their kid picked orange juice out of a lineup.

419
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:50,220
So you figure they slip the kid a mickey so they don't have to deal.

420
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,340
Do a biopsy to confirm cirrhosis.

421
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:55,690
And don't try and pawn it off on Wilson-- he's gonna be busy with Cuddy.

422
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:03,910
My parents loved me unconditionally.

423
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:06,100
Get out of here.

424
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:11,310
Don't you think the restraining order's a little much?

425
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:14,150
He's not actually going to have sex with a 17-year-old patient.

426
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:18,150
I didn't think he was gonna ask me to dig a blood stained carpet out of a dumpster, either.

427
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:20,810
It might be easier in the long run.

428
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:26,840
Are we stopping here so House doesn't find us?

429
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:29,110
Unless you want to make out.

430
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:32,760
You want me to surrender to House's coup?

431
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:36,340
No, no, you proactively...

432
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:38,750
Give him what he wants.

433
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:40,680
I defeat him by surrendering to him.

434
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,090
He'll never see it coming.

435
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,760
Look, I'll pay for it myself.

436
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,890
What is it, a thousand bucks to carpet a room?

437
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:47,200
Actually, it's 400.

438
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,660
Oh-- Not doing it.

439
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,450
Liver biopsy?

440
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,540
They're doing it now.

441
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,660
How's it going?

442
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,130
Like a biopsy.

443
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,460
Needles, cells.

444
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:03,860
Screaming.

445
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:05,630
What'd you findin the stool sample?

446
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:09,990
You were too busy bothering Cuddy, but as discussed, it was negative for parasites.

447
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,270
Can we get out of here?

448
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:12,750
I didn't ask what you didn't find.

449
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,760
I asked what you did find in the stool sample.

450
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:16,450
Stool.

451
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:19,500
And traces of iron, zinc, calcium carbonate.

452
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,330
Can we leave?

453
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:21,140
What's the matter?

454
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,140
You afraid of the man?

455
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:28,050
Too late.

456
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,420
Leave my stuff alone!

457
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:33,660
You have a meeting with a Guggenheim in 15 minutes.

458
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,850
Wearing that?

459
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:37,920
I'm gonna count to three, and then I'm gonna fire you.

460
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:41,190
- One.
- Calcium carbonate, that's an antidiarrheal, right?

461
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:42,890
- Two.
- You think that's significant?

462
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:45,830
You think hard poops is significant?

463
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,820
Two and a half?

464
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,280
Never threaten unless you're ready to deliver.

465
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,620
Makes you look weak.

466
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:55,030
Thank god you don't have children.

467
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,600
Dr. Cuddy.

468
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:03,170
Take a message.

469
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:07,800
Your patient is being rushed to cardiac ICU.

470
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:12,420
That's like the one thing that would get me outta here.

471
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,940
I'm sorry, you can't come in here now.

472
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,660
What's going on?

473
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,360
He's in v-fib.

474
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,010
Clear.

475
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,140
Charging.

476
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:30,990
Clear.

477
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:32,070
Charging.

478
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:32,950
Clear.

479
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:34,200
Charging.

480
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:35,170
Clear.

481
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,190
He's stable for the moment.

482
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:51,530
First-degree atrial ventricular block.

483
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,730
Okay.

484
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:53,820
What else do we know?

485
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:56,920
His liver's damaged, pleural effusion compromised his lung function.

486
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,190
biopsy was negative for cirrhosis.

487
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:01,720
Parents didn't poison their son.

488
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:05,760
It's not his liver, his heart, or his lungs.

489
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:08,460
It's the calcium carbonate in his stool.

490
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,410
Kid was constipated.

491
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:11,200
Parents probably just overdid it.

492
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:13,320
Or they didn't do it at all.

493
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:15,630
Calcium carbonate's also what's in chalk.

494
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:16,920
So he ate some chalk.

495
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:19,710
It isn't toxic-- Sure didn't cause the pleural effusion.

496
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:20,690
Forget the chalk.

497
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:21,870
You just said it was about the chalk.

498
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,930
Yes, and then I said, "forget the chalk".

499
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:25,700
You must be very confused.

500
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,320
This kid's got pica.

501
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,810
Take him to a buffet, he's gonna eat the table.

502
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:30,850
Or lead paint.

503
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:32,420
Level of lead in the blood was normal.

504
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,340
His tox screen was clean.

505
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:34,860
We're not looking for typical poisons.

506
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:37,020
We're looking for anything that he can put in his mouth.

507
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:38,940
Matches, spiders, bricks.

508
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:41,590
Pressure-treated wood used to contain arsenic.

509
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:42,920
Even better.

510
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:43,560
Hansel?

511
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,330
Get samples of the ginger bread house.

512
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,020
Bag everything.

513
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:04,410
You could get into a lot of trouble,being here.

514
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,010
I wanted to see you.

515
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,570
Yeah, I got that.

516
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:10,710
So did everyone else.

517
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:12,610
They think you're a stalker.

518
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:15,810
One could argue those people might be jealous of your attention.

519
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:19,230
Yes,I actually made that argument.

520
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,300
You going home?

521
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:23,020
That's the plan.

522
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:27,670
In Iceland, the age of consent is 14.

523
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,320
I'm surprised that tourism isn't a bigger industry up there.

524
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:33,520
So today I'm jailbait.

525
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:35,510
But in 22 weeks...

526
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:39,320
Anybody can do anything to me.

527
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:42,890
Will I be so different in 22 weeks?

528
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:46,180
22 weeks is enough for an embryo to grow arms and legs.

529
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:48,310
It's just a line.

530
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:51,790
An arbitrary line drawn by a bunch of sad, old men in robes.

531
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:52,830
Yeah.

532
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:55,100
Who cares what judges think?

533
00:26:56,280 --> 00:27:00,920
Didn't think of youas a guy who followed rules just because they were rules.

534
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:09,180
You are... over ten years younger than me.

535
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,530
I said over.

536
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:15,780
Gotta go!

537
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:17,340
House.

538
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,610
Dr. Cuddy!

539
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:21,730
Do you happen to know the way to the Icelandic consulate?

540
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,720
This young woman, a stranger to me, was just asking directions.

541
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:27,560
Security was gonna call the police.

542
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,940
I don't want to do that to you.

543
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,830
Go home.

544
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,870
She needed a ride.

545
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:34,060
She got her on her own, she can get home on her own.

546
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:36,990
Now.

547
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:42,320
And if I see you on hospital grounds again, I will call the police.

548
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:58,260
After that look, I'm feeling a little frisky.

549
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,640
Looks like you're up.

550
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:01,920
I'm ovulating. Let's go.

551
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,210
The frisky, it went away.

552
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:08,180
House, this isn't a game.

553
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,700
If I leave her alone, can I have my carpet back?

554
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:17,150
No.

555
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:20,730
If I forget about my carpet, can I have her?

556
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:47,310
Jimsonweed.

557
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:50,020
Found a small patch of it in his backyard.

558
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:52,190
Jimsonweed contains atropine.

559
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:53,650
Poor man's acid.

560
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:57,230
Our kid's been tripping on Lucy in the sky with cubic zirconia.

561
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:59,640
Explains the pleural effusion, the heart arrhythmias.

562
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:01,610
Meeting here will do nothing to upset Cuddy.

563
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,820
I'm not trying to upset Cuddy.

564
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:05,290
I'm trying to figure out what's wrong with the patient.

565
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,360
Continue.

566
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:07,020
I'm done.

567
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:09,420
Jimsonweed doesn't explain the screaming.

568
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,370
You've obviously never had a bad trip.

569
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,780
I would've thought you'd try to accomplish two goals at once.

570
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:17,370
Why can't you be more like the other age-in appropriate girls who have a thing for me?

571
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,570
Just accept me for me.

572
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:21,380
Continue.

573
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:25,180
Treatment for jimsonweed od is physostigmine.

574
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,350
Kid's got heart issues.

575
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:27,420
The two don't mix.

576
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,800
We'd better make sure that's what he's got.

577
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:31,840
Serum from the lab in paterson is three days, minimum.

578
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,030
He won't survive three days.

579
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,700
What time does he wake up?

580
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,510
7:35 am.

581
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:38,540
Then what?

582
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:39,450
Walk me through it.

583
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:42,560
7:40 to 7:50, he goes to the toilet, washes his face.

584
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:43,420
What does this matter?

585
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,770
I'm trying to prove he ate the plant.

586
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:46,870
His schedule has nothing to do with jimsonweed.

587
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:49,970
There are two possibilities-- either the parents saw him eat the plant,

588
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:54,110
or the kid has unsupervised time and eats plants instead of playing with blocks.

589
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:58,300
Even if you find 15 minutes of free time outside, doesn't mean he spent it eating a bush.

590
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,260
So what do we do?

591
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:00,070
Nothing?

592
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,330
Wait for the kid to tell us?

593
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:02,830
What?

594
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,580
Where are you going?

595
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,500
To talk to him.

596
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:23,230
Ever see your son eat a bush?

597
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:23,970
I haven't.

598
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:25,460
I've only ever seen him eat what--

599
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,670
Adam, you ate something at your house.

600
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:29,460
Something that made you sick.

601
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:31,920
I need you to show me what you ate.

602
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,490
He can't answer you.

603
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:35,080
Neither can you.

604
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:39,030
This is your backyard.

605
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:41,520
You may know it as Mel's diner.

606
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:43,210
This is your sandbox.

607
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:45,120
Your jungle gym.

608
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:47,790
And under it is this.

609
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:53,110
I need to know if you ate this, Adam.

610
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,460
He doesn't know what you want.

611
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,230
Adam, you have to tell me.

612
00:30:57,770 --> 00:30:59,700
Because if you don't...

613
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,310
It'll be game over.

614
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:07,440
- You'll be dead.
- What the hell are you doing?

615
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:09,470
Show me what you ate.

616
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,350
Adam.

617
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:13,720
Show me what you ate.

618
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,260
Sandbox

619
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,740
- Adam?
- Honey?

620
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:37,550
Adam?

621
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:48,030
Come on in, brothers and sister!

622
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:50,160
Welcome to the house of the lord.

623
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,630
House, come on.

624
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:52,380
The chapel?

625
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:56,410
We have been blessed with the miracle of a new symptom.

626
00:31:56,450 --> 00:32:02,820
Brother, can you testify as to why this poor child's eyeball rolled back into his head?

627
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,580
It's consistent with jimsonweed poisoning-- ocular paralysis.

628
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,180
Sorry.

629
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:11,950
The wicked shall deceive ye, because they have turned from the Lord and are idiots.

630
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:14,500
His ocular muscle didn't paralyze, it pirouetted.

631
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:15,320
M.S.

632
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:18,480
It is easier for a wise man to gain access to heaven

633
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,030
Will you stop doing that? Just say "not M.S".

634
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:21,970
A stroke.

635
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:23,190
Bleed in the brain.

636
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:26,560
We'd be seeing other symptoms besides a single eye misalignment.

637
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,230
Like a coma.

638
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,600
And you've already testified.

639
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:30,040
It's a tumor.

640
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:32,200
And all the imaging just missed it?

641
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,750
It's a microtumor.

642
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:36,050
Started in his lung, which caused the pleural effusion.

643
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:39,130
Then it metastasized to his liver, which made it slough cells.

644
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:43,550
And then went to his brain, behind the eye, which caused it to roll back into his head.

645
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:47,110
So he has three tumors and we missed all of them.

646
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:48,410
What's the opposite of a miracle?

647
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:52,260
I have a better chance of finding it now that I know exactly where to look.

648
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,620
So...

649
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:57,830
Unless you have a better idea, I'm gonna go cut his head.

650
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:02,430
And then, if--if I have to, remove his eye.

651
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:11,200
You remove this kid's eye, he's only gonna behalf as good at not making eye contact.

652
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,440
Hello?

653
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:27,490
Hello?

654
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:30,700
Hello?

655
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:33,880
I have sad news for you.

656
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,470
She doesn't love you.

657
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,240
You're ugly when you're jealous.

658
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:39,150
She showed up at my house last night.

659
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:41,130
Came on to me.

660
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:43,030
She's even more perfect than I thought.

661
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:44,370
House.

662
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:45,920
She's sick.

663
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:48,520
You say "sick", I say "freestylin'".

664
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,910
The girl will have sex with an invertebrate.

665
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:51,590
Come on.

666
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:53,450
You're not that bad.

667
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,180
She has a problem.

668
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,200
You're not doing her any favors by indulging her.

669
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,980
Why would you lie like this?

670
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:00,980
Do you not have room your heart for love?

671
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:02,290
You don't believe me.

672
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:05,140
I didn't believe the kids when they said that Susie was sleeping with Johnny.

673
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:06,540
I didn't believe them then, I don't believe them now.

674
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:09,640
I don't care that Susie married Johnny-- he's mine.

675
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:13,970
She has a mole on her right breast, just below the nipple.

676
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,150
No, she doesn't.

677
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:16,380
You've seen her breasts?

678
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,750
It was a medical exam.

679
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:18,900
I was listening to her heart.

680
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:23,240
It went, "Greg-House, Greg-House, Greg-House."

681
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:25,760
Fine, I'm lying.

682
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:28,000
But she did come back.

683
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:29,910
She's locked up in my office.

684
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,690
I was hoping you could talk to her.

685
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,510
Put an end to this.

686
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,860
Listen to me.

687
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:56,390
Do you have any idea what you'd have to look forward to if you stayed with me?

688
00:34:56,420 --> 00:35:00,270
Nine chances out of ten, we'd both wind up in a jail.

689
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,750
You're only saying that to make me go.

690
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,510
I'm saying it 'cause it's true.

691
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:12,590
Inside of us, we both know that you belong with Victor.

692
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:16,970
Is there a Victor in your class?

693
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:24,250
If you're not with someone your age, you'll regret it.

694
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:27,110
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon.

695
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:29,120
And for the rest of your life.

696
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:32,630
What about us?

697
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:35,380
We'll always have Fresno.

698
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:38,850
I'm no good at being noble,

699
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:45,820
but it doesn't take much to see that the problems of two little people dot amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world.

700
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:50,180
Someday you'll understand that.

701
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:53,920
Now, now.

702
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:56,820
Here's looking at you...

703
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,520
Damn.

704
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:08,090
Was there an earthquake when you were in Fresno?

705
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,120
What?

706
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,680
I ask all my girlfriends that.

707
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:17,000
Yeah, a little one.

708
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:19,010
Damn.

709
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:19,990
What?

710
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:20,960
What, what is it?

711
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:23,060
It's not love.

712
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:25,860
You have a spore in your brain.

713
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,780
Coccidioides immitis.

714
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:29,050
California's full of 'em.

715
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:33,000
They get an earthquake, they get released into the air, you breathe it in, you get a cold...

716
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:35,690
Turns into sinus congestion, aches, weakness...

717
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:36,950
Milky tears...

718
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:39,360
And sometimes...

719
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:43,640
A loss of inhibition and judgment.

720
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,270
Damn!

721
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:46,640
So...

722
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:48,690
loving you?

723
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:50,790
Wanting to have sex with you?

724
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:52,240
It was all just...

725
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:54,340
the spores talking?

726
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,770
You'll probably live.

727
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,340
Damn.

728
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:30,690
Hey!

729
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,700
Don't touch his eye.

730
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:35,240
This is an appendectomy.

731
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:40,380
Like i said, don't touch his eye.

732
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,090
Why isn't he in surgery?

733
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:46,140
Well, some emergency bumped him.

734
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,500
We've got another room in ten minutes.

735
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,230
You're not taking him in.

736
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,940
Kill the lights.

737
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:55,900
He was seeing them all the time.

738
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:57,300
What are you looking for?

739
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,890
And he was telling us what he was seeing.

740
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:01,480
Telling us exactly what was wrong with him.

741
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:04,340
Drawing them for us over and over again.

742
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:07,070
Nobody knew how to speak "autistic".

743
00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:09,440
When I asked him what he ate, he even told me that.

744
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,280
What are you talking about?

745
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:12,230
What was he seeing?

746
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,710
Hello, my pretties.

747
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:18,460
It's not a tumor, Foreman.

748
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,390
It's worms.

749
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,360
Swimming in his eye.

750
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:25,170
Animal makes potty in the sandbox.

751
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,460
Boy plays in the sandbox, boy eats the sand.

752
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:30,430
You can probably tell where this is going by now.

753
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:32,110
Stool samples were negative for parasites.

754
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:35,070
Raccoon roundworms are not excreted by their human host.

755
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:36,460
Cameron tested the sand.

756
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,010
All of it?

757
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:40,860
Worms spread from his gutto the rest of his body.

758
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,920
They attacked his lungs.

759
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:44,360
That's what made him scream and caused the effusion.

760
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:48,030
They invade his liver, sending dead liver cells coursing through his system.

761
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:53,130
They attack his eyeand the muscles surrounding it, making his eyeball do a backflip.

762
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:58,870
Laser photocoagulation to fix the eye and a high dose of benzimidazole to kill the worms.

763
00:38:58,890 --> 00:38:59,950
Wait a minute.

764
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:00,960
That's it?

765
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:03,050
H-he's gonna be okay?

766
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:04,690
Good news.

767
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,040
He's gonna be with you for a long, long time.

768
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,940
I'm going to read you something.

769
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:21,230
"Asperger's syndrome is a mild and rare form of autism".

770
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:26,360
"It is typically characterized by difficulty establishing friendshipsand playing with peers,

771
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:33,050
trouble accepting convential social rules, and they dislike any change in setting or routine."

772
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:34,680
Or broadloom.

773
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:36,850
It doesn't say that last part, but you get my point.

774
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:38,320
House doesn't have Asperger's.

775
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,370
The diagnosisis much simpler.

776
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:41,450
He's a jerk.

777
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:43,380
Why do you think he took this case?

778
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:45,120
Because he believes these parents?

779
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:47,320
Because he wants to help a young boy?

780
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:50,280
He sees himself in this kid.

781
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:53,680
And he's trying to help himself.

782
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:56,630
He doesn't want this.

783
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:58,530
He needs it.

784
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:14,980
You're not autistic.

785
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:16,530
You don't even have Asperger's.

786
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:17,910
You wish you did.

787
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:20,030
It would exempt you from the rules.

788
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:23,190
Give you freedom, absolve you of responsibility.

789
00:40:23,210 --> 00:40:25,290
Let you date 17-year-olds.

790
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:28,840
But most important, it would mean that you're not just a jerk.

791
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:34,900
At what point does a person endlessly lecturing someone make him a jerk?

792
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:43,980
Your first tongue kiss...

793
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:47,470
An eight on the happiness scale.

794
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:51,700
Your child being snatched back from the brink of death...

795
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,530
That's a ten.

796
00:40:56,680 --> 00:41:00,860
But they're clocking in at a very tepid 6.5,

797
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:04,100
because they know what they have to go back to.

798
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,630
Uh, listen...

799
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:15,590
Thanks.

800
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:18,310
You saved his life.

801
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:19,890
Yeah, I know.

802
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:21,390
See ya.

803
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:17,620
That was so good.

804
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:31,980
That was a ten.

805
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:54,240
All change is bad?

806
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:57,520
It's not true, you know.

807
