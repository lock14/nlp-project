No.

Wonder if Matt sees that camera yet.....

4
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:10,893
Yep.

5
00:01:10,961 --> 00:01:12,519
The camera, yeah.

6
00:01:19,636 --> 00:01:20,625
Hey, man.

7
00:01:37,721 --> 00:01:40,019
Oh. I didn't know it had water in it.

8
00:01:57,507 --> 00:01:59,304
Go, go, go!

9

Go.

<i>In the aftermath
of the nuclear attacks in Texas,</i>

11
00:02:19,362 --> 00:02:22,058
<i>America found itself
on the brink of anarchy.</i>

12
00:02:22,132 --> 00:02:24,965
<i>Hundreds of thousands have
perished in the nuclear attacks...</i>

13

<i>in Abilene and El Paso, Texas.</i>

14
00:02:26,369 --> 00:02:28,564
<i>The president has declared

15

<i>FEMA has ordered evacuation

16
00:02:32,642 --> 00:02:36,043
<i>The worst attack on the United States
in the history of our country.</i>

17
00:02:42,085 --> 00:02:46,249
<i>Those without protective glasses are
instructed to sit down on the ground</i>

18
00:02:46,323 --> 00:02:48,518

19
00:02:49,592 --> 00:02:51,150
<i>World War llI had begun.</i>

<i>No.</i>

21
00:03:14,718 --> 00:03:15,707
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

22
00:03:16,853 --> 00:03:18,878
<i>The accelerated conflict
in the Middle East</i>

23
00:03:18,955 --> 00:03:22,288
<i>placed significant restrictions
on American access to oil.</i>

24
00:03:23,293 --> 00:03:26,751
<i>Alternative fuel sources
became a lucrative commodity.</i>

25
00:03:28,264 --> 00:03:30,732
<i>Americans were transfixed
by the terrorist threat</i>

26
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,928
<i>and the will to prevent another attack
by any means necessary.</i>

27
00:03:37,507 --> 00:03:40,738
<i>Military checkpoints
were erected at each state line.</i>

28
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:43,870
<i>Interstate travel visas
were required of each citizen.</i>

29
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:50,013
<i>Dissenting liberal extremist cells
began to emerge,</i>

30
00:03:50,086 --> 00:03:53,180
<i>the most vocal of which
were the Neo-Marxists.</i>

31
00:03:55,825 --> 00:03:58,157
<i>The 2008 presidential election</i>

32
00:03:58,228 --> 00:04:01,629
<i>was to be decided by
the electoral votes of just one state</i>

33
00:04:01,698 --> 00:04:04,258
<i>as the Republicans
raced to secure California</i>

34
00:04:04,334 --> 00:04:06,802
<i>for the first time since 1988.</i>

35
00:04:08,805 --> 00:04:12,502
<i>On June 27, 2008,

37
00:04:15,578 --> 00:04:17,239
<i>vanished without a trace.</i>

38
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:30,987
<i>Three days later, he was discovered
in the Nevada desert</i>

39
00:04:31,061 --> 00:04:32,494
<i>with his memory erased.</i>

40
00:04:34,964 --> 00:04:38,127
<i>The government knew he had
crossed back into California.</i>

41
00:04:40,703 --> 00:04:43,365
<i>But the circumstances
of his return to the Southland</i>

42
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,771

00:06:54,804 --> 00:06:57,136
<i>Southland residents

<i>The government decided that

UPU 5.

92
00:08:28,364 --> 00:08:30,161
Here at last!

93
00:08:44,013 --> 00:08:46,447
<i>Boxer Santaros
had returned from the desert</i>

94
00:08:46,516 --> 00:08:47,744
<i>with a case of amnesia.</i>

95
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,815
<i>Someone had gotten under his skin.</i>

96
00:09:02,565 --> 00:09:05,159
<i>Her name was Krysta Kapowski,</i>

97
00:09:05,234 --> 00:09:07,464
<i>and together
they had written a screenplay</i>

98
00:09:07,537 --> 00:09:09,903
<i>that foretold
the tale of our destruction.</i>

99
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:17,610
<i>You almost wrecked my car.</i>

100
00:09:18,881 --> 00:09:19,939
<i>Well?</i>

101
00:09:22,719 --> 00:09:23,708
<i>Get in.</i>

102
00:09:28,257 --> 00:09:29,451
Stigmata.

103
00:09:30,493 --> 00:09:33,894
<i>We'll hear that fine new platter
by Nat King Cole...</i>

<i>"I'd Rather Have The Blues. "</i>

105
00:09:41,237 --> 00:09:44,001
<i>The war machine
was running out of gas.</i>

106
00:09:45,742 --> 00:09:47,300
<i>And there was no alternative.</i>

107
00:09:49,145 --> 00:09:50,976
<i>Alternative fuel, that is.</i>

108
00:09:53,015 --> 00:09:55,074
<i>Until one day,</i>

109
00:09:55,151 --> 00:09:57,711
<i>when a renegade scientist
arrived in the Southland</i>

110
00:09:57,787 --> 00:09:59,254
<i>with a cure for our sickness.</i>

111
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:04,055
<i>He built this great big machine
out in the ocean</i>

112
00:10:04,127 --> 00:10:08,564
<i>that would generate a hydroelectric
energy field called Fluid Karma...</i>

113
00:10:12,201 --> 00:10:16,160
<i>a wireless network of electric power
that would run machines by remote...</i>

114
00:10:18,574 --> 00:10:21,202
<i>machines that would never
have to be refueled.</i>

115
00:10:23,746 --> 00:10:25,737
<i>Treer Products is proud to present</i>

116
00:10:25,815 --> 00:10:29,080
<i>the wizard Baron Von Westphalen

<i>Have you built the world's first
perpetual motion machine?</i>

118
00:10:33,556 --> 00:10:37,390
The ocean is
a perpetual motion machine.

119
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:40,623
Fluid Karma is a simulation

120
00:10:40,696 --> 00:10:43,324
of the principles
you see working right here.

121
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:48,393
As long as the waves continue to crash,
Fluid Karma will exist.

122
00:10:49,472 --> 00:10:51,906
<i>Quantum teleportation.</i>

123
00:10:51,974 --> 00:10:55,842
<i>Explain the transport mechanism.
That's all I'm asking.</i>

124
00:10:55,912 --> 00:11:01,009
<i>Fluid Karma works via the principle
of quantum entanglement.</i>

125
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:06,077
<i>Particles thus entangled
will behave identically...</i>

126
00:11:06,155 --> 00:11:07,417
<i>Operation Q...</i>

<i>as seen by Joan Collin, reporter.</i>

130
00:11:13,563 --> 00:11:18,694
<i>I had to see Operation Q
through many eyes, not only my own,</i>

131
00:11:18,768 --> 00:11:20,827
<i>but as a reporter through the eyes</i>

132
00:11:20,903 --> 00:11:22,803
<i>of the average American
man and woman.</i>

133
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:31,146
<i>I'm Krysta,</i>

00:11:31,214 --> 00:11:32,977

<i>Join us for an in-depth discussion</i>

138
00:11:45,394 --> 00:11:48,454
<i>of the penetrating issues
facing society today...</i>

139
00:11:48,531 --> 00:11:56,631
<i>issues like abortion, terrorism,
crime, poverty, social reform,</i>

140
00:11:56,706 --> 00:12:00,699
<i>quantum teleportation,
teen horniness, and war.</i>

141
00:12:01,711 --> 00:12:04,271
<i>Now we all made decisions
in our youth to start doing porn.</i>

142
00:12:04,347 --> 00:12:06,679
<i>I think it's time that we
turn the mirror on ourselves.</i>

143
00:12:06,749 --> 00:12:10,617
<i>And once you get on the bang bus,
you never get off.</i>

144
00:12:10,686 --> 00:12:13,678
<i>You know what?
The bang bus should be banned.</i>

145
00:12:13,756 --> 00:12:17,089
<i>It's totally unethical,
even within the parameters of porn.</i>

146
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:19,593
<i>Do you like to get slapped
to the ground and fucked?</i>

147
00:12:19,662 --> 00:12:22,722
<i>Too violent.
Violence and porn should not mix.</i>

148
00:12:22,798 --> 00:12:24,561
<i>It gives porn a bad name.</i>

149
00:12:24,634 --> 00:12:26,397
<i>You know what?
I like to get fucked.</i>

150
00:12:26,469 --> 00:12:27,936
<i>I like to get fucked hard.</i>

151
00:12:28,004 --> 00:12:31,030
<i>- Yeah. Me, too.
- Amen to that.</i>

152
00:12:31,107 --> 00:12:33,541
<i>I mean, violence is a big problem
in our society today,</i>

153
00:12:33,609 --> 00:12:34,701
<i>and I will not support it.</i>

154
00:12:34,777 --> 00:12:36,938
<i>That's the primary reason
why I won't do anal.</i>

155
00:12:37,013 --> 00:12:38,241
<i>I didn't know that about you.</i>

156
00:12:38,314 --> 00:12:39,679
<i>Makes me want to give up anal.</i>

157
00:12:39,749 --> 00:12:42,274
Anyone who knows
anything of history

158
00:12:42,351 --> 00:12:43,978
knows that great social changes

159
00:12:44,053 --> 00:12:46,681
are impossible
without feminine upheaval.

160
00:12:46,756 --> 00:12:48,621
<i>Our first issue today is terrorism.</i>

161
00:12:48,691 --> 00:12:51,751
Go ahead and make fun of
my prophecies all you want, Fortunio.

162
00:12:55,865 --> 00:12:57,594
But deep down inside,

163
00:12:57,667 --> 00:13:00,295
everyone wishes
they were a porn star.

164
00:13:01,304 --> 00:13:02,828
Really?

165
00:13:02,905 --> 00:13:06,136
We're a bisexual nation
living in denial,

166
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:08,142
all because of a bunch of nerds,

167
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:11,976
a bunch of nerds who got off a boat
in the 15th century

168
00:13:12,048 --> 00:13:15,142
and decided that sex
was something to be ashamed of.

169
00:13:15,217 --> 00:13:18,152
All the Pilgrims did was ruin
the American Indian orgy of freedom.

170
00:13:27,697 --> 00:13:28,925
You been lying to me?

171
00:13:30,433 --> 00:13:31,991
You have to trust me.

172
00:13:33,202 --> 00:13:34,692
I'm here to protect you.

173
00:13:37,239 --> 00:13:38,228
From who?

174
00:13:39,775 --> 00:13:42,471
From the people out there
who want to destroy you.

175
00:13:43,813 --> 00:13:44,973
<i>Later that day,</i>

176
00:13:45,047 --> 00:13:49,347
<i>Krysta had a lunch meeting
with adult film director Cyndi Pinziki.</i>

177
00:13:49,418 --> 00:13:51,511
Well, in my first six movies
I was just "Krysta. "

178
00:13:51,587 --> 00:13:53,851
You know, but then in order
to differentiate myself

179
00:13:53,923 --> 00:13:55,857
from the 76 other Krystas
in the business,

180
00:13:55,925 --> 00:13:57,722
I added the "Now. "

181
00:13:57,793 --> 00:13:58,782
Wow.

182
00:13:58,861 --> 00:14:04,197
Well, it's all about now, 2008,
not next week, not tomorrow.

183
00:14:04,266 --> 00:14:08,566
If you want to fuck me,
you can fuck me... now.

184
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,430
Wow.

185
00:14:12,508 --> 00:14:15,102
<i>So is that the name
of your TV show? Now?</i>

186
00:14:15,177 --> 00:14:18,010
It's a topical-discussion-
chat-reality show.

187
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,049
Got the pop album, the jewelry,

188
00:14:21,117 --> 00:14:24,883
clothing and perfume line,
the energy drink.

189
00:14:25,888 --> 00:14:28,652
This is a very ambitious
business plan.

190
00:14:35,931 --> 00:14:37,558
Can you keep a secret?

191
00:14:37,633 --> 00:14:38,827
Of course.

192
00:14:42,071 --> 00:14:45,768
I'm fucking a very large
and important man.

193
00:14:46,776 --> 00:14:48,107
Wow.

194
00:14:49,111 --> 00:14:51,079
<i>The search for Boxer Santaros</i>

195
00:14:51,147 --> 00:14:54,275
<i>reached up into the highest levels
of national security...</i>

196
00:14:56,085 --> 00:14:58,610
<i>led by none other
than his mother-in-law...</i>

197
00:15:00,723 --> 00:15:02,418
<i>Nana Mae Frost...</i>

00:15:03,492 --> 00:15:06,620
<i>wife of Republican senator

<i>former prom queen

200
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,934
Nana Mae Frost,
please acknowledge.

201
00:15:14,003 --> 00:15:16,471
<i>Identification confirmed.
Welcome aboard, Miss Frost.</i>

202
00:15:16,539 --> 00:15:17,528
Thank you.

203
00:15:19,175 --> 00:15:21,040
<i>Nana makes me wear
these fucking things.</i>

204
00:15:22,044 --> 00:15:23,306
<i>Do I look like a nerd?</i>

205
00:15:23,379 --> 00:15:24,403
<i>No.</i>

206
00:15:25,815 --> 00:15:28,579
<i>- Welcome to Treer Plaza, tower one.
- Yes.</i>

207
00:15:29,585 --> 00:15:32,486
<i>We know that Boxer crossed
the border into California.</i>

208
00:15:32,555 --> 00:15:36,753
<i>There hasn't been a single fingerprint
found in the system since then.</i>

209
00:15:36,826 --> 00:15:38,794
We know someone
must be hiding him.

210
00:15:38,861 --> 00:15:40,761
What the hell was he doing
in Nevada?

211
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:43,731
We think he was kidnapped
at a charity scavenger hunt.

212
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:45,767
Somebody stole
one of the prototype SUVs

213
00:15:45,835 --> 00:15:47,393
from a warehouse in San Pedro.

214
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:48,835
Tracking devices tell us

215
00:15:48,904 --> 00:15:51,338
that they crossed the border
way out past Lake Mead.

216
00:15:51,407 --> 00:15:53,568
Get over to the computer.
I can show you.

217
00:15:53,642 --> 00:15:56,202
<i>- All right.
- He's been brainwashed.</i>

218
00:15:56,278 --> 00:15:59,338
<i>I'm sending you
the surveillance footage right now.</i>

219
00:16:01,417 --> 00:16:03,317
This footage
was taken by his abductor,

220
00:16:03,385 --> 00:16:06,752
someone with ties
to the Neo-Marxist movement.

221
00:16:08,257 --> 00:16:09,383
Is that Boxer?

222
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:10,948
Yes.

223
00:16:14,764 --> 00:16:16,595
Is this the last time anybody saw him?

224
00:16:16,665 --> 00:16:18,360
Yes, except for these.

225
00:16:24,974 --> 00:16:26,839
What's that, smoke?

226
00:16:26,909 --> 00:16:28,740
Somehow
the vehicle caught on fire.

227
00:16:28,811 --> 00:16:30,403
There was somebody in there, too.

228
00:16:33,716 --> 00:16:34,876
What?

229
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:38,408
Baron has retrieved
the charred remains of the body.

230
00:16:38,487 --> 00:16:41,615
- Have they identified the body yet?
- Not that I know of.

231
00:16:43,926 --> 00:16:47,692
<i>Grid nine zero two
nine one.</i>

232
00:16:55,271 --> 00:16:58,263
<i>Venice Beach was home
to the Neo-Marxist underground.</i>

233
00:17:06,448 --> 00:17:09,815
<i>They were the disciples
of German philosopher Karl Marx.</i>

234
00:17:16,492 --> 00:17:18,483
Here we go, just in time.

235
00:17:18,561 --> 00:17:22,361
This is Fortunio Balducci,
his new best friend.

236
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:24,490
Drug dealer, pimp,

237
00:17:24,567 --> 00:17:27,468
co-producer
on some new mystery project.

238
00:17:27,536 --> 00:17:30,437
He's been crashing with Fortunio
in Manhattan Beach all week.

239
00:17:30,506 --> 00:17:33,771
They hooked up
on some drug binge out in Vegas.

240
00:17:33,843 --> 00:17:37,609
Our little Krysta
has promised me a marriage killer,

241
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,614
maybe even an election killer.

242
00:17:41,584 --> 00:17:43,609
Boxer hasn't talked
to his wife in a week.

243
00:17:43,686 --> 00:17:45,176
She's on the campaign trail.

244
00:17:45,254 --> 00:17:46,778
Nobody knows where he's been,

245
00:17:46,856 --> 00:17:52,988
much to the senator's dismay,
and his bitch wife, Nana Mae.

246
00:17:53,062 --> 00:17:55,360
People in Washington
are already whispering.

247
00:17:55,431 --> 00:17:57,558
Looks like the nervous breakdown
of the century.

248
00:17:57,633 --> 00:17:59,726
Too bad it's an election year.

249
00:17:59,802 --> 00:18:03,294
Nothing that an eight ball, a porn star,
and tattoo parlor can't handle.

250
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:08,400
<i>Revelation 6:8...</i>

251
00:18:08,477 --> 00:18:11,878
<i>"And behold, a pale horse,</i>

252
00:18:11,947 --> 00:18:15,314
<i>and he who sat on it,
his name was Death. "</i>

253
00:18:17,753 --> 00:18:19,983
You know, there'd be
a lot less violence in the world

254
00:18:20,055 --> 00:18:21,886
if everyone just got
a little more cardio.

255
00:18:21,957 --> 00:18:24,084
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

256
00:18:24,159 --> 00:18:25,592
Hey, is that a bazooka?

257
00:18:26,629 --> 00:18:33,262
That is a heat-seeking ground-to-air
rocket launcher from Syria.

258
00:18:33,335 --> 00:18:35,166
You can't afford that.

259
00:18:36,171 --> 00:18:38,731
What exactly do you want?

260
00:18:38,807 --> 00:18:40,934
I need some
9 millimeter blanks.

261
00:18:43,245 --> 00:18:45,577
What else do you need
along with the blanks?

262
00:18:46,582 --> 00:18:48,846
That's all, just the blanks.

263
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:05,425
Here is your UPU 9
and the blanks.

264
00:19:09,171 --> 00:19:11,105
What the fuck is this?

265
00:19:12,274 --> 00:19:14,401
What, you won't take
a personal check?

266
00:19:14,476 --> 00:19:17,673
No, I won't take a fucking check.

267
00:19:17,746 --> 00:19:22,843
Get the fuck out of my ice cream truck,
you Cro-Magnon bitch.

268
00:19:24,453 --> 00:19:26,546
Say it again, man.
Say it again.

269
00:19:26,622 --> 00:19:28,783
Huh? What was that?
Huh?

270
00:19:29,358 --> 00:19:31,485
What was that?
I can't hear you.

271
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,991
I can't hear you.

272
00:19:33,062 --> 00:19:35,622
What was that?
Say it again, you fuck!

273
00:19:42,671 --> 00:19:43,933
There.

274
00:19:45,674 --> 00:19:47,005
Cock fucker.

275
00:19:51,313 --> 00:19:52,940
<i>They've synthesized a narcotic.</i>

276
00:19:53,015 --> 00:19:56,849
<i>The narcotic is injected into the neck.
These are human receivers.</i>

277
00:19:56,919 --> 00:19:58,944
<i>They're conducting
experiments on soldiers.</i>

278
00:19:59,021 --> 00:20:02,252
<i>This is a known fact, and no one
will release the information.</i>

279
00:20:03,425 --> 00:20:06,223
<i>Perpetual motion machines

280
00:20:06,295 --> 00:20:09,230
<i>that are supposed to disobey
one of the laws...</i>

281
00:20:09,298 --> 00:20:12,165
<i>They called him Ronald Taverner,</i>

282
00:20:12,234 --> 00:20:13,565
<i>and he was their pawn</i>

283
00:20:13,635 --> 00:20:16,229
<i>in a dangerous game
of political extortion.</i>

284
00:20:16,305 --> 00:20:17,795
<i>...disorder in the universe.</i>

285
00:20:17,873 --> 00:20:20,467
<i>You're just reading a bunch of stuff
you read off the Internet.</i>

286
00:20:20,542 --> 00:20:21,531
<i>You're not listening.</i>

287
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:23,635
<i>- I always think that...
- You're not listening.</i>

288
00:20:23,712 --> 00:20:27,842
<i>- ... writes about science.
- This is a law of thermodynamics...</i>

289
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:29,747
Ronald, they're just blanks,
sweetheart.

290
00:20:29,818 --> 00:20:30,876
<i>...terribly difficult.</i>

291
00:20:30,953 --> 00:20:32,818
<i>We deduce

00:20:37,493 --> 00:20:38,721
<i>...are reversible.</i>

294
00:20:40,162 --> 00:20:42,130
There's a delay in my reflection.

295
00:20:42,197 --> 00:20:45,564
<i>...which implies that if you start
with n possible states...</i>

296
00:20:45,634 --> 00:20:47,625
What did you tell him?

297
00:20:47,703 --> 00:20:50,570
That he hit his head in the desert,
and he has amnesia.

298
00:20:50,639 --> 00:20:52,664
<i>The Baron claims
that Fluid Karma is safe,</i>

299
00:20:52,741 --> 00:20:54,766
<i>but he refuses to release
the environmental...</i>

300
00:20:54,843 --> 00:20:57,038
Well, these things...
these things better look real.

301
00:20:57,112 --> 00:20:58,101
Ronald?

302
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:00,944
Bing said they're going to look real.

303
00:21:01,016 --> 00:21:03,678
When Ronald fires,
he's going to hit the squibs.

304
00:21:03,752 --> 00:21:06,983
You just drugged and kidnapped
an UPU 2 officer.

305
00:21:07,056 --> 00:21:09,149
Okay, that's against the law,
sweetheart.

306
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:13,824
Now, I need you to come out here
and do this thing.

307
00:21:15,564 --> 00:21:18,533
You need to become a racist cop.

308
00:21:19,601 --> 00:21:21,933
Come on, honey.
Let's dry our tears and face our fears.

309
00:21:27,876 --> 00:21:31,073
<i>If you succeed in building one,
you are guaranteed</i>

310
00:21:31,146 --> 00:21:35,014
<i>not to be able to explain it

311
00:21:40,923 --> 00:21:42,322
Promise me you won't get hurt.

312
00:21:43,459 --> 00:21:45,222
We promise.

313
00:21:45,294 --> 00:21:47,592
<i>The Neo-Marxists
had taken a hostage...</i>

314
00:21:48,597 --> 00:21:49,996
<i>a hostage they would use</i>

315
00:21:50,065 --> 00:21:53,091
<i>to expose the sins
committed by USIDent.</i>

316
00:22:19,661 --> 00:22:22,596
<i>His mission was
to impersonate his twin brother.</i>

317
00:22:25,834 --> 00:22:28,132
<i>But his heart

318
00:22:42,551 --> 00:22:43,779
Officer Roland Taverner.

319
00:22:43,852 --> 00:22:45,479
Of course you are.
How you doing, man?

320
00:22:45,554 --> 00:22:47,181
When did you get back
from the desert?

321
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:52,226
Don't exactly remember.

322
00:22:54,596 --> 00:22:56,530
Oh, that's okay.
That's okay, you're okay.

323
00:22:56,598 --> 00:22:58,532
Come on, let's go upstairs,
right over here.

324
00:23:00,769 --> 00:23:04,569
This is an epic
Los Angeles crime saga.

325
00:23:05,107 --> 00:23:07,007
And you're researching your role.

326
00:23:07,075 --> 00:23:09,635
You play a cop.
You want to do a ride-along?

327
00:23:09,711 --> 00:23:10,973
Yes, exactly.

328
00:23:11,046 --> 00:23:14,607
But I'm also directing the film.
It takes place in the near future.

329
00:23:14,683 --> 00:23:16,082
Right.

330
00:23:16,151 --> 00:23:18,210
Scientists are saying
the future's going to be

331
00:23:18,287 --> 00:23:20,915
far more futuristic
than they originally predicted.

332
00:23:24,259 --> 00:23:26,386
The basic concept is this...

333
00:23:26,461 --> 00:23:29,897
I play an LAPD cop
who isn't who he seems.

334
00:23:30,899 --> 00:23:35,393
He's a paranoid schizophrenic
who has a supernatural gift.

335
00:23:37,105 --> 00:23:38,470
He sees things.

336
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:41,941
And he senses a change
in the city.

337
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:45,446
Crime suddenly skyrockets
for no apparent reason.

338
00:23:45,514 --> 00:23:48,677
The world is coming to an end.

339
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:51,310
And he's the only one
who can see the truth.

340
00:23:51,853 --> 00:23:53,218
What's the truth?

341
00:23:57,192 --> 00:23:58,750
My character,

342
00:23:58,827 --> 00:24:02,319
he realizes that
the apocalyptic crime rate

343
00:24:02,397 --> 00:24:04,126
is because of global deceleration.

344
00:24:04,199 --> 00:24:07,794
The rotation of the Earth
is slowing down

345
00:24:07,869 --> 00:24:10,895
at a rate of point zero,

346
00:24:10,973 --> 00:24:11,962
zero, zero,

347
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,632
zero, zero, zero,

348
00:24:13,709 --> 00:24:14,937
zero...

349
00:24:15,944 --> 00:24:19,175
six miles per hour each day,

350
00:24:19,248 --> 00:24:22,775
disrupting the chemical equilibrium
in the human brain,

351
00:24:22,851 --> 00:24:27,311
causing very irrational
criminal behavior.

352
00:24:27,856 --> 00:24:31,519
How does he stop
the global deceleration?

353
00:24:32,094 --> 00:24:34,153
Oh, he can't stop it.

354
00:24:34,229 --> 00:24:36,789
There is no stopping
what can't be stopped.

355
00:24:36,865 --> 00:24:38,093
Only God...

356
00:24:39,268 --> 00:24:40,530
can stop it.

357
00:24:40,602 --> 00:24:43,867
<i>But The New York Times
said "God is dead. "</i>

358
00:24:44,439 --> 00:24:49,342
So in the end, I die
in a very tragic downtown shootout

359
00:24:49,411 --> 00:24:52,278
while whispering my theory
to Dr. Muriel Fox,

360
00:24:52,347 --> 00:24:55,043
the oceanography disaster specialist.

361
00:24:55,117 --> 00:24:56,914
Astrophysicist!

362
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:01,653
The oceanography
disaster specialist...

363
00:25:03,659 --> 00:25:05,024
sweetheart.

364
00:25:07,262 --> 00:25:09,958
My character... his name...

365
00:25:11,967 --> 00:25:13,594
is Jericho Kane.

366
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:19,898
You're going to have
to wear a bulletproof vest.

367
00:25:23,412 --> 00:25:25,380
Let me ask you,
what goes through your head

368
00:25:25,447 --> 00:25:26,937
when you sit behind the wheel...

369
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:31,244
cruising the streets,
digesting humanity?

370
00:25:32,921 --> 00:25:35,048
Is it a process of elimination?

371
00:25:35,123 --> 00:25:38,854
<i>Each car that passes,
the person inside...</i>

372
00:25:38,927 --> 00:25:40,758
<i>are they a mere suspect?</i>

373
00:25:41,863 --> 00:25:44,229
<i>Or are we all innocents,</i>

374
00:25:44,299 --> 00:25:46,460
<i>our chariots mere chess pieces</i>

375
00:25:46,535 --> 00:25:50,335
waiting to be thrown from the gridlock
and into the arms of the wolves?

376
00:25:52,541 --> 00:25:55,442
Well, I'd say
we act like concerned citizens.

377
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:58,308
We look at all the people,
all the cars.

378
00:25:59,314 --> 00:26:01,544
We look for any unusual
or erratic behavior.

379
00:26:03,251 --> 00:26:06,277
Speed changes or lane changes
that seem unsafe.

380
00:26:06,355 --> 00:26:08,823
Yeah, but don't you think
emotions come into play?

381
00:26:10,492 --> 00:26:11,891
Judgment calls,

382
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:15,452
affected by whatever mood you're in
on that particular day?

383
00:26:16,465 --> 00:26:19,025
Emotional responses
based on your past events?

384
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:23,703
Well, there is one thing.

385
00:26:25,307 --> 00:26:26,331
I knew it.

386
00:26:26,408 --> 00:26:28,467
I knew it, tell me. Be honest.

387
00:26:32,948 --> 00:26:34,245
To be honest...

388
00:26:35,283 --> 00:26:37,012
we're just looking out
for the niggers.

389
00:26:53,468 --> 00:26:56,028
- The niggers?
- Yeah.

390
00:26:56,571 --> 00:26:58,061
They're everywhere.

391
00:27:05,747 --> 00:27:08,238
- You're joking.
- No, I'm not joking.

392
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:13,285
I'm just fucking with you, man.

393
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:19,625
That's a funny joke.

394
00:27:20,862 --> 00:27:23,524
Yes! He said "nigger. "

395
00:27:23,598 --> 00:27:25,463
But I don't think he said it
with authority.

396
00:27:25,534 --> 00:27:28,833
I didn't believe him as a racist cop.
Fascist, maybe, but not racist.

397
00:27:31,606 --> 00:27:33,301
<i>Ask him about his wife.</i>

398
00:27:35,877 --> 00:27:38,243
So what does your wife think
about your new girlfriend?

399
00:27:39,448 --> 00:27:41,814
- My wife?
- Yeah.

400
00:27:43,785 --> 00:27:47,221
She cool with the fact that you have
a porn-star girlfriend on the side?

401
00:27:47,289 --> 00:27:48,415
I'm not married.

402
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:50,685
- You're not?
- No, I'm not.

403
00:27:52,461 --> 00:27:55,726
I could've sworn you were married
to the daughter of a Texas senator,

404
00:27:55,797 --> 00:27:57,856
Senator Bobby Frost.

405
00:27:57,933 --> 00:27:59,195
Yeah, well, I'm not.

406
00:27:59,267 --> 00:28:02,065
I don't know what you're talking about,
and I don't know who he is.

407
00:28:02,137 --> 00:28:03,604
I don't want to talk about this.

408
00:28:03,672 --> 00:28:06,402
Why are you asking questions?
I want to talk about my movie.

409
00:28:06,475 --> 00:28:08,238
Okay. Let's talk about your film.

410
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:10,834
What's it really about?

411
00:28:16,485 --> 00:28:19,943
It all hinges
on a top secret experiment.

412
00:28:21,022 --> 00:28:23,252
Young couple comes
home from the hospital

413
00:28:23,325 --> 00:28:24,849
with their newborn baby.

414
00:28:24,926 --> 00:28:27,986
A week goes by, and the baby still
hasn't produced a bowel movement.

415
00:28:29,464 --> 00:28:31,557
Maybe the baby's just constipated.

416
00:28:31,633 --> 00:28:33,123
No, no, no, no.

417
00:28:33,201 --> 00:28:34,998
This is a very special baby.

418
00:28:36,271 --> 00:28:38,933
This baby processes
energy differently.

419
00:28:44,145 --> 00:28:46,409
I haven't had a bowel movement
in six days.

420
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:50,115
I haven't taken a piss either.

421
00:28:56,358 --> 00:28:57,518
<i>Revelation 11</i>

422
00:28:57,592 --> 00:29:00,857
<i>tells the tale of two witnesses
who appear in Jerusalem</i>

423
00:29:00,929 --> 00:29:03,420
<i>to speak out
against the sins of mankind.</i>

424
00:29:05,834 --> 00:29:07,529
<i>They are eventually killed</i>

425
00:29:07,602 --> 00:29:09,797
<i>by those tormented
by their prophesies.</i>

426
00:29:13,441 --> 00:29:16,877
The dude hasn't taken a shit
in a week.

427
00:29:16,945 --> 00:29:18,435
When has it ever been in the Bible

428
00:29:18,513 --> 00:29:20,378
that you have to have
a bowel movement?

429
00:29:20,448 --> 00:29:21,745
It's not written anywhere.

430
00:29:21,816 --> 00:29:23,078
It's not written in the Bible,

431
00:29:23,151 --> 00:29:25,847
but some things is written,
like, in Mother Nature.

432
00:29:25,921 --> 00:29:29,220
All of the animals shit.
Cows shit, Ilamas shit.

433
00:29:29,291 --> 00:29:31,122
Do they like it?
Do they want to?

434
00:29:31,192 --> 00:29:33,626
If they had a voice,
would they rather not?

435
00:29:33,695 --> 00:29:36,061
I think they feel better
after they take a shit.

436
00:29:36,131 --> 00:29:38,292
I think they do like it.
My answer's yes.

437
00:29:38,366 --> 00:29:40,197
My answer is no.

438
00:29:40,268 --> 00:29:43,169
We're never going to agree on this.
We've got to stop arguing.

439
00:29:43,238 --> 00:29:45,069
We have a lot of footage
we've got to shoot.

440
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:47,267
We've got to get out of here.
Where is Kenny?

441
00:29:47,342 --> 00:29:49,310
Oh, look who decided to show up.

442
00:29:49,377 --> 00:29:51,538
Dude, you are late.

443
00:29:51,613 --> 00:29:52,978
You two don't understand.

444
00:29:53,048 --> 00:29:56,245
I mean, the shit is
literally hitting the fan.

445
00:29:56,318 --> 00:29:57,546
Whatever, dude.

446
00:29:58,887 --> 00:30:00,411
Are we still routing out of USIDent?

447
00:30:00,488 --> 00:30:02,012
Yeah, of course.
We never stopped.

448
00:30:03,892 --> 00:30:08,522
Ken, he wakes up,
give him an injection right there.

449
00:30:13,902 --> 00:30:16,132
<i>- Dude, you are late.
- You two don't understand.</i>

450
00:30:16,204 --> 00:30:19,367
<i>I mean, the shit is
literally hitting the fan.</i>

451
00:30:20,375 --> 00:30:23,902
<i>The Neo-Marxists
had recruited young Kenny Chan</i>

452
00:30:23,979 --> 00:30:27,176
<i>to work as a mole inside of USIDent.</i>

453
00:30:27,248 --> 00:30:28,237
Hey, Starla?

454
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:30,581
Can I get my coat back?

455
00:30:35,657 --> 00:30:37,124
Appreciate it.

456
00:30:37,192 --> 00:30:40,992
<i>But it had been his great misfortune
to trust his colleague...</i>

457
00:30:41,062 --> 00:30:43,656
<i>Starla Von Luft.</i>

458
00:30:49,037 --> 00:30:51,437
<i>Senator Bobby Frost
arrived in the Southland</i>

459
00:30:51,506 --> 00:30:53,269
<i>as the campaign
for the White House</i>

00:30:53,341 --> 00:30:56,276
<i>finds itself in a race

461

<i>Senator Frost plans to tour

<i>at Santa Monica Pier,</i>

<i>from environmental groups</i>

<i>USIDent has unraveled
a conspiracy</i>

467
00:31:10,525 --> 00:31:13,358
<i>involving the trafficking
of human fingers.</i>

Well, Christ Almighty.

Lookie here.

473
00:31:23,938 --> 00:31:26,498
"Teen horniness is not a crime. "

474
00:31:26,574 --> 00:31:27,905
I never said it was.

475
00:31:27,976 --> 00:31:30,672
Sir, I'm afraid it gets even worse.

476
00:31:30,745 --> 00:31:32,838
Well, how the hell can it get
any worse?

477
00:31:34,416 --> 00:31:36,043
We just received this image of Boxer

478
00:31:36,117 --> 00:31:41,054
from an unidentified source
calling themselves "Deep Throat Two. "

479
00:31:41,122 --> 00:31:43,090
They're transmitting
from a scrambler.

480
00:31:43,158 --> 00:31:44,284
We can't trace it.

481
00:31:45,293 --> 00:31:46,317
Oh, my God.

482
00:31:46,394 --> 00:31:48,225
Well, how about that?
Talk of the devil,

483
00:31:48,296 --> 00:31:50,355
we've got an incoming call
from Deep Throat Two.

484
00:31:50,432 --> 00:31:52,764
Who are you,
and what do you want?

485
00:31:52,834 --> 00:31:55,997
<i>This is Deep Throat Two.
The bitch is back.</i>

486
00:31:56,071 --> 00:32:01,008
And she's got Boxer Santaros
on tape in compromising positions.

487
00:32:02,944 --> 00:32:05,071
And how much
do you want for the tape?

488
00:32:05,146 --> 00:32:07,137
One million dollars cash

489
00:32:07,215 --> 00:32:10,673
<i>and a yes vote endorsement
by the senator on Proposition 69.</i>

490
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:15,554
Miss Deep Throat,
this is Senator Bobby Frost.

491
00:32:15,623 --> 00:32:18,114
I just saw your little movie.
I think it stinks.

492
00:32:18,193 --> 00:32:22,152
<i>Furthermore, we do not
negotiate with terrorists.</i>

493
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:24,721
And if you think you're going
to get any money out of us,

494
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:27,199
you've got miles to go
before you sleep

495
00:32:27,268 --> 00:32:29,532
and miles to go before you sleep.

496
00:32:34,042 --> 00:32:35,339
Bitch.

497
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:40,938
All right, no need to panic.
We've always got phase two.

498
00:32:41,015 --> 00:32:42,744
Wait, what is phase two?

499
00:32:42,817 --> 00:32:44,785
You didn't tell me
there was a phase two.

500
00:32:44,853 --> 00:32:48,584
Krysta, no offense to you
and your little career-makeover plan,

501
00:32:48,656 --> 00:32:51,216
but we are trying to impact
the outcome of an election.

502
00:32:52,227 --> 00:32:54,092
<i>Proposition 69.</i>

503
00:32:55,263 --> 00:32:58,027
<i>To Krysta, that number
had one meaning</i>

504
00:32:58,099 --> 00:32:59,691
<i>and one meaning only.</i>

505
00:33:00,835 --> 00:33:02,200
<i>To everyone else,</i>

506
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:05,103
<i>it was a proposition on the ballot

00:33:05,173 --> 00:33:08,609
<i>of the oppressive institution
known as USIDent.</i>

<i>When will we be free of this terror?</i>

510
00:33:16,451 --> 00:33:19,215
<i>Vote no. No!</i>

511
00:33:21,156 --> 00:33:24,182
<i>I think the press conference
is over. Thank you.</i>

<i>Always the nerds.</i>

513
00:33:27,262 --> 00:33:30,322
<i>And the Supreme Court

514
00:33:30,398 --> 00:33:32,628
<i>who the fuck elected them
anyway, right?</i>

515
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:35,533
<i>I mean, they're a bunch
of supreme shit heads, right?</i>

516
00:33:35,603 --> 00:33:39,505
<i>Don't tell me what to do
with my body, you fuckstick, right?</i>

517
00:33:39,574 --> 00:33:42,941
<i>I have a question
for the Supreme Court.</i>

518
00:33:43,011 --> 00:33:47,209
<i>What happens when
a woman has sex on a flight</i>

519
00:33:47,282 --> 00:33:50,683
<i>from London to Los Angeles,</i>

520
00:33:50,752 --> 00:33:55,689
<i>then takes the morning-after pill
while flying across the time zone?</i>

521
00:33:57,525 --> 00:33:58,514
<i>I don't know.</i>

522
00:33:58,593 --> 00:34:00,788
<i>Then it becomes
the morning-before pill.</i>

523
00:34:00,862 --> 00:34:02,056
<i>You are a genius.</i>

524
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:04,598
<i>- Holy shit. That is brilliant.
- Hello. Can't argue with that.</i>

525
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,728
<i>Urban pacification units
arrested a group of individuals</i>

526
00:34:08,803 --> 00:34:10,498
<i>tied to the Neo-Marxist movement,</i>

527
00:34:10,572 --> 00:34:14,133
<i>fighting to impose restrictions

528
00:34:14,209 --> 00:34:15,836
<i>through Proposition 69.</i>

529
00:34:15,910 --> 00:34:18,572
<i>ACLU representatives

530
00:34:18,646 --> 00:34:20,136
<i>where there were more arrests.</i>

531
00:34:20,215 --> 00:34:23,150
...and I know what I want.
- We need to stay in the moment...

532
00:34:23,218 --> 00:34:24,742
<i>Phase two was now in motion.</i>

533
00:34:25,887 --> 00:34:28,617
<i>Dion and Dream were going
to stage their own demise...</i>

534
00:34:29,757 --> 00:34:32,453
<i>a desperate attempt
to destroy USIDent.</i>

535
00:34:37,432 --> 00:34:38,490
Hit me again, baby.

536
00:34:43,404 --> 00:34:46,464
You know, I still don't see
why facial prosthetics are necessary.

537
00:34:46,541 --> 00:34:47,906
That wasn't part of the plan.

538
00:34:47,976 --> 00:34:52,811
I told you a million times, genius,
Dion and I are cultural icons.

539
00:34:52,881 --> 00:34:55,975
We cannot afford to get recognized
by the camera.

540
00:34:58,286 --> 00:34:59,275
Oh, that's right.

541
00:34:59,354 --> 00:35:01,686
See, I didn't realize
that your spoken-word poetry

542
00:35:01,756 --> 00:35:04,350
had captured the cultural zeitgeist
of the nation, Dream.

543
00:35:04,425 --> 00:35:07,826
Yeah, well, at least I'm not
a second-rate comedian, Zora.

544
00:35:07,896 --> 00:35:10,797
Just because it's loud
doesn't mean it's funny.

545
00:35:12,967 --> 00:35:15,731
You know, you might want
to watch what you say, bitch.

546
00:35:15,803 --> 00:35:19,500
Sometimes a dream can become
a nightmare on the turn of a dime.

547
00:35:20,074 --> 00:35:22,338
Will you two just chill the fuck out?

548
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:24,037
Go get those squib detonators ready,

549
00:35:24,112 --> 00:35:25,977
They're going to be here
in, like, an hour.

550
00:35:27,782 --> 00:35:31,513
Hey, Bing, these off-road rollerblades
were a great idea.

551
00:35:31,586 --> 00:35:33,178
Thanks, Zora.

552
00:35:36,824 --> 00:35:39,258
<i>There is a fucking firewall

553
00:35:39,327 --> 00:35:41,761

Right now this place is probably wired.</i>

555
00:35:48,369 --> 00:35:50,030
No, no, I told you.

556
00:35:50,104 --> 00:35:53,540
I told you, I tried
the goddamn password.

557
00:35:53,608 --> 00:35:56,008
<i>So you did hear me
13 minutes ago?</i>

558
00:35:56,077 --> 00:35:57,408
<i>- Yes.
- About the firewall?</i>

559
00:35:57,478 --> 00:35:59,912
<i>Give me a password that will work.</i>

560
00:35:59,981 --> 00:36:01,812
<i>Fuck her.</i>

00:36:01,883 --> 00:36:05,080
You know what?
Nana Mae Frost can eat a fucking dick.

562
00:36:06,621 --> 00:36:07,986
Take him down.

563
00:36:46,361 --> 00:36:47,453
<i>Kenny, get out of there...</i>

564
00:36:47,528 --> 00:36:48,859
No, no.

565
00:36:57,071 --> 00:37:00,097
Look, you can't be calling me
five times a day with this.

566
00:37:00,174 --> 00:37:01,266
I'm at work.

567
00:37:02,276 --> 00:37:03,300
Yeah, well...

568
00:37:03,378 --> 00:37:05,812
Yeah, you know,
cat throw-up doesn't come out.

569
00:37:08,483 --> 00:37:10,110
<i>So what the hell is it
you want me to do?</i>

570
00:37:10,685 --> 00:37:12,744
Fire at will.

571
00:37:21,295 --> 00:37:23,388
Wake up. Wake up.
You have to wake up now!

572
00:37:45,653 --> 00:37:47,587
Where is he?

573
00:37:47,655 --> 00:37:49,316
I don't know.

574
00:37:53,828 --> 00:37:55,295
Take him down.

575
00:37:57,565 --> 00:37:59,294
He doesn't know who he is.

576
00:37:59,367 --> 00:38:00,698
Promise me you'll find him.

577
00:38:00,768 --> 00:38:02,963
- I promise.
- Okay, good.

578
00:38:04,739 --> 00:38:07,139
There's a window right up there.
You got to go.

579
00:39:24,819 --> 00:39:26,252
I've had this recurring dream.

580
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:30,379
Tell me about it.

581
00:39:34,529 --> 00:39:37,054
I wake up in this dungeon.

582
00:39:38,633 --> 00:39:40,567
The walls are made of sand.

583
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:47,132
As I slowly make my way
through this maze,

584
00:39:47,208 --> 00:39:49,199
approaching
a light source at the end...

585
00:39:51,379 --> 00:39:53,438
guess who's standing there
waiting for me?

586
00:39:55,283 --> 00:39:56,272
Who?

587
00:39:57,618 --> 00:39:58,915
You.

588
00:40:08,563 --> 00:40:11,225
Do you ever feel like there's
a thousand people...

589
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,362
locked inside of you?

590
00:40:16,871 --> 00:40:18,133
Sometimes.

591
00:40:20,141 --> 00:40:23,804
But it's your memory
that keeps them glued together.

592
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,580
Keeps all those people from...

593
00:40:31,052 --> 00:40:32,644
fighting one another.

594
00:40:36,691 --> 00:40:38,852
Maybe in the end that's all we have.

595
00:40:41,596 --> 00:40:43,962
The memory gospel.

596
00:41:03,751 --> 00:41:05,218
Would you excuse me for a second?

597
00:41:08,089 --> 00:41:09,078
Yes.

598
00:42:14,288 --> 00:42:17,689
"Here we go
round the prickly pear.

599
00:42:23,331 --> 00:42:25,822

600
00:42:36,310 --> 00:42:39,438
Meet Dr. Inga Von Westphalen.

601
00:42:40,648 --> 00:42:43,139
Charmed, I'm sure.

602
00:42:44,719 --> 00:42:48,246
He is a fine specimen,

603
00:42:48,322 --> 00:42:50,984
a divine specimen.

604
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:58,792
Whatever happens next
is through no fault of your own.

605
00:43:00,234 --> 00:43:03,169
We have read your screenplay.

<i>The Power.</i>

607
00:43:18,386 --> 00:43:20,911
How did you get a copy
of my screenplay?

608
00:43:22,423 --> 00:43:26,359
Don't look so scared,
Mr. Santaros.

609
00:43:26,427 --> 00:43:27,758
The future...

610
00:43:30,965 --> 00:43:33,456
is just like you imagined.

611
00:43:33,534 --> 00:43:36,992
This is the way the world ends.

612
00:43:37,071 --> 00:43:39,869
Not with a whimper.

613
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:43,706
But with a bang.

She's been on bathroom detail

622
00:44:25,085 --> 00:44:26,643

Good evening, officer.
I'm researching my movie.

672
00:47:05,813 --> 00:47:07,906
Sounds like you could use
a little backup.

673
00:47:10,351 --> 00:47:12,216
I think I can handle this.

00:47:44,885 --> 00:47:47,376
That's why I had to fuck
your brother on our wedding night.

689
00:47:47,454 --> 00:47:49,422
I'll fucking knock
the shit out of you, bitch.

690
00:47:49,490 --> 00:47:52,050
You knock the shit out of me,
I'll sue the shit out of you!

691
00:48:22,423 --> 00:48:25,483
Fuck you!
Don't fucking say that to me.

692
00:48:25,559 --> 00:48:29,154
You're a fucking dick.
I can't even believe I married you.

693
00:48:29,229 --> 00:48:32,221
What the fuck is wrong
with you people?

694
00:48:34,501 --> 00:48:36,264
Is that Ronald?

695
00:48:39,807 --> 00:48:41,206
Check this out, pig!

696
00:48:41,275 --> 00:48:43,004
Fascist dogma applied

697
00:48:43,077 --> 00:48:44,977

698
00:48:45,045 --> 00:48:46,535

00:48:46,613 --> 00:48:48,604
A vote in your subjective election

700
00:48:48,682 --> 00:48:51,845
That's an original poem by Dream.

701
00:48:56,190 --> 00:48:58,124
Oh, shit.

702
00:49:00,194 --> 00:49:01,456
Dream over.

703
00:49:11,138 --> 00:49:13,003
Flow my tears.

704
00:49:14,775 --> 00:49:17,710
Now, that was loud.
And that was funny.

705
00:49:18,812 --> 00:49:19,801
They weren't armed.

706
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:27,881
This is my deal now.

707
00:49:29,790 --> 00:49:32,554
Now, get the fuck out of here...

708
00:49:32,626 --> 00:49:34,821
Santaros.

709
00:49:52,513 --> 00:49:54,504
You're not really here.

710
00:49:55,082 --> 00:49:56,106
Who am I?

711
00:49:57,484 --> 00:49:59,213
None of your business.

712
00:50:00,287 --> 00:50:02,448
Now, get the fuck out of here.

713
00:50:02,523 --> 00:50:04,286
<i>It was an inspired idea...</i>

714
00:50:05,292 --> 00:50:07,658

715

<i>committed by a racist cop,</i>

717
00:50:16,170 --> 00:50:17,535
Go!

718
00:50:17,604 --> 00:50:20,971
<i>But no one could've anticipated
the untimely arrival</i>

719
00:50:21,041 --> 00:50:23,874
<i>of Officer Bart Bookman.</i>

720
00:50:40,394 --> 00:50:41,383
Shit.

<i>Cease to resist</i>

<i>But I sail away</i>

727
00:51:22,603 --> 00:51:26,437
<i>On a wave of mutilation</i>

728
00:51:27,007 --> 00:51:31,103

734
00:51:48,362 --> 00:51:49,727
Yes.

<i>I've uncovered the secret documents

737
00:51:55,369 --> 00:51:57,234
Your hypothesis was correct.

738
00:51:57,304 --> 00:51:59,033
A corruption in the tidal drag

739
00:51:59,106 --> 00:52:01,631
has caused a rift
in the space-time continuum.

740
00:52:02,209 --> 00:52:03,471
Where is the rift?

741
00:52:03,543 --> 00:52:06,205
<i>Out in the desert,

742
00:52:06,747 --> 00:52:07,941

743
00:52:09,016 --> 00:52:10,677
I cannot tell you here.

744
00:52:11,818 --> 00:52:13,149

It is a great honor

00:53:43,043 --> 00:53:44,738
Thank you,

752
00:53:44,811 --> 00:53:47,439
Did I just see two cars
pork each other?

753
00:53:47,514 --> 00:53:48,879
Indeed.

754
00:53:48,949 --> 00:53:50,211
That was disgusting.

755
00:53:50,283 --> 00:53:53,275
I wouldn't worry, sir.
That's the European version.

756
00:53:55,956 --> 00:53:58,481
The tides have turned.

757
00:53:59,726 --> 00:54:03,822
No longer must we burn
the spirits of the dead.

758
00:54:04,831 --> 00:54:08,426
No longer must we treat
our precious ozone layer

759
00:54:08,502 --> 00:54:12,131
like the bastard stepchild
of the cosmos.

760
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:18,772
No longer can even

761
00:54:18,845 --> 00:54:21,905

This is Jericho Kane.

766
00:54:41,868 --> 00:54:43,062

<i>This is Jericho Kane.</i>

768
00:54:44,237 --> 00:54:45,226

00:54:46,773 --> 00:54:47,831
Who's this?

770
00:54:47,908 --> 00:54:50,240
Where... where are you?

771
00:54:50,310 --> 00:54:52,710
I'm in Venice,
somewhere in Venice.

772
00:54:54,114 --> 00:54:57,083
Boxer, Boxer,
go to the Baja Cantina.

773
00:54:57,150 --> 00:55:00,642
It's at the mouth of the Venice Canal,
on Washington Boulevard.

774
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:02,813
Baja Cantina.
It's a restaurant.

775
00:55:02,889 --> 00:55:04,151
Baja Cantina?

776
00:55:04,224 --> 00:55:06,692
You stay right there.
I'm going to send a car to get you.

777
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:08,853
- Where is he?
- He's in Venice, the Baja Cantina...

778
00:55:08,929 --> 00:55:11,796
...mouth of the Venice Canal,
right on Washington Boulevard.

779
00:55:13,333 --> 00:55:15,767
- Venice Beach, yeah.
- We got him.

780
00:55:15,836 --> 00:55:18,464
<i>I just want to say

781

782
00:55:20,907 --> 00:55:23,102

783
00:55:23,176 --> 00:55:25,974

784

00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:30,838

786
00:55:34,855 --> 00:55:36,186
Fuck.

787
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:51,128
It's an urgent problem
regarding Boxer Santaros.

788
00:55:52,139 --> 00:55:53,800
What do you mean
he's unavailable?

789
00:55:53,874 --> 00:55:55,705
Unavailable, my ass!

790
00:55:55,775 --> 00:55:57,743
You tell Vaughn Smallhouse

791
00:55:57,811 --> 00:56:00,211
he better not fuck
with Deep Throat Two.

792
00:56:02,549 --> 00:56:05,245
How the fuck am I supposed
to blackmail some movie star

793
00:56:05,318 --> 00:56:08,219
if I can't get his fucking
representation on the phone?

794
00:56:08,288 --> 00:56:11,451
These Hollywood managers,
they think their shit don't smell.

795
00:56:11,525 --> 00:56:12,958
Let me tell you something, Teri.

796
00:56:13,026 --> 00:56:15,756
When the shit hits the fan,
it all smells the same.

797
00:56:15,829 --> 00:56:17,592
Fuck, yeah, it does.

798
00:56:22,836 --> 00:56:24,701
I don't know
what it is you've done...

799
00:56:25,805 --> 00:56:28,365
but you have to promise me
that he won't get hurt.

800
00:56:30,010 --> 00:56:32,308
He's not the person you think he is.

801
00:56:55,168 --> 00:56:56,897
Mr. Santaros.

802
00:57:07,847 --> 00:57:08,836
Nice. Yeah.

803
00:57:08,915 --> 00:57:12,009
You got the... the head
of the Neo-Marxist underground

804
00:57:12,085 --> 00:57:14,076
and his bitch girlfriend,

805
00:57:14,154 --> 00:57:18,488

real name Veronica Mung.

806
00:57:28,268 --> 00:57:29,667
Dion and Dream are dead.

807
00:57:31,271 --> 00:57:34,138
They're not.
They were just squibs.

808
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:35,902
Those weren't squibs.

809
00:57:37,277 --> 00:57:38,767
Yes, they were.

810
00:57:40,847 --> 00:57:44,214
We doubled up on the squibs,
Roland, two each.

811
00:57:44,284 --> 00:57:45,979
I thought my name was Ronald.

812
00:57:47,954 --> 00:57:51,549
That's what I said, I said Ronald.
What's wrong with you?

813
00:57:51,625 --> 00:57:53,525
I think you've been
lying to me, Zora.

814
00:57:54,928 --> 00:57:56,259
Yeah.

815
00:57:56,329 --> 00:57:58,297
I think you've been
lying to me all along.

816
00:58:00,333 --> 00:58:03,268
Okay, now you're just being
paranoid, Ronald.

817
00:58:03,336 --> 00:58:04,462
Listen, guys.

818
00:58:05,472 --> 00:58:07,736
I think I'm going
to rollerblade on home now

819
00:58:07,807 --> 00:58:15,236
because I don't really want to be
involved in this anymore, at all.

820
00:58:17,784 --> 00:58:18,842
Okay, Bing.

821
00:58:19,953 --> 00:58:21,318
Go ahead.

822
00:58:22,889 --> 00:58:24,254
Good luck.

823
00:58:24,324 --> 00:58:26,690
You can keep
the rollerblades, Zora.

824
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:29,194
Just consider them a gift.

825
00:58:29,262 --> 00:58:30,593

938
01:07:06,345 --> 01:07:08,336
They're right, Bob, we should pay.

945
01:07:25,798 --> 01:07:27,265
Pregnant? She's pregnant?

946
01:07:27,333 --> 01:07:28,891
Yeah, you're gonna be
a granddaddy.

947
01:07:28,968 --> 01:07:32,131
Miss Krysta, did somebody
put you up to this?

948
01:07:34,106 --> 01:07:36,597
Yeah. He did.

949
01:07:37,777 --> 01:07:41,042
He paid me to bring Boxer back
from the desert safe and in one piece.

950
01:07:41,113 --> 01:07:42,978
- Baron, Baron.
- No, no.

951
01:07:43,049 --> 01:07:44,038
Is this true?

952
01:07:44,116 --> 01:07:45,105
Preposterous.

953
01:07:45,184 --> 01:07:48,176
- Listen to me, would you stop it?
- I'll cut you down, you little shit.

954
01:07:48,254 --> 01:07:49,812
Hey, we're on the same team here.

955
01:07:49,889 --> 01:07:52,289
Baron would not sabotage
the campaign.

956
01:07:52,358 --> 01:07:53,791
Who are you going to trust, Bob,

957
01:07:53,860 --> 01:07:58,320
a Nobel prize-winning scientist
or a two-bit porn star?

958
01:07:58,898 --> 01:08:00,593
I don't know, Dad.

959
01:08:01,701 --> 01:08:02,690
I wouldn't trust him,

960
01:08:02,768 --> 01:08:04,759
because you know
he's been secretly funding

961
01:08:04,837 --> 01:08:06,168
the Neo-Marxist movement.

962
01:08:06,239 --> 01:08:09,072
What? How dare you.

963
01:08:09,141 --> 01:08:14,169
Those clowns know less
about Karl Marx than that Chihuahua.

964
01:08:14,247 --> 01:08:20,117
No, you have been secretly sabotaging
this campaign from the inside out.

965
01:08:20,186 --> 01:08:24,486
You should be very careful
about pointing fingers, Madeline,

966
01:08:24,557 --> 01:08:26,286
because I happen to know

967
01:08:26,359 --> 01:08:30,090
that you are pregnant
with Brandt's baby,

968
01:08:30,162 --> 01:08:33,359
and I have the blood tests
to prove it.

969
01:08:33,432 --> 01:08:34,524
Baron.

970
01:08:36,669 --> 01:08:37,658
Baron.

971
01:08:38,971 --> 01:08:41,667
The car is waiting, my child.

972
01:08:41,741 --> 01:08:43,299
Not now, mother.

973
01:08:43,376 --> 01:08:45,970
Mr. Takahashi

974
01:08:46,045 --> 01:08:50,277
has accepted
the terms of the deal.

975
01:08:50,349 --> 01:08:52,010
We have to deal
with Deep Throat Two.

976
01:08:52,084 --> 01:08:53,142
Brandt, you're mine.

977
01:08:54,220 --> 01:08:56,745
I'm not staying in here when
all this stuff is going on,

978
01:08:56,822 --> 01:08:59,518
and Mom is out there,
and she's not in here with us.

979
01:08:59,592 --> 01:09:01,184
- Mom's all right.
- I don't like it.

980
01:09:01,260 --> 01:09:02,454
It makes me feel anxious.

981
01:09:02,528 --> 01:09:04,223
You will never get reelected.

982
01:09:25,985 --> 01:09:27,612
I love you, Jericho Kane.

983
01:09:51,177 --> 01:09:52,337

Yeah.

986
01:09:55,514 --> 01:09:57,311
Go to the base
of the Santa Monica Pier.

987
01:09:57,383 --> 01:10:00,409

995

You said finger, not entire hand.

01:14:57,149 --> 01:14:59,709
Martin Kefauver has arrived.

1039
01:15:12,865 --> 01:15:14,127
Is it God?

1040
01:15:15,601 --> 01:15:17,262
It's... it's medicinal.

1041
01:15:24,543 --> 01:15:26,875
Now, dog, I seen...
I seen all your movies.

1042
01:15:28,814 --> 01:15:30,372
You're... you're great.

1043
01:15:31,417 --> 01:15:32,816
I know I'm great.

1044
01:15:32,885 --> 01:15:34,512
Tell me something I don't know.

1045
01:15:37,423 --> 01:15:40,392
My dad is your plastic surgeon.

1046
01:15:45,597 --> 01:15:47,360
Murray Kefauver's kid.

1047
01:15:47,433 --> 01:15:49,094
Yeah.

1048
01:15:49,168 --> 01:15:51,102
- Shit, man, how the hell are you?
- Yeah, dog.

1049
01:15:51,170 --> 01:15:52,637
Hey, tell your dad I said hey.

1050
01:15:52,705 --> 01:15:55,833
I mean, tell him... tell him I'm...
I'm going to give him a call.

1051
01:15:55,908 --> 01:15:56,897
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1052
01:15:56,975 --> 01:16:00,604
Yeah, Fallujah.
Shit got fucked up.

1053
01:16:00,679 --> 01:16:02,112
Anyways, hey.

1054
01:16:03,382 --> 01:16:05,043
Let's get down to business.

1055
01:16:06,518 --> 01:16:07,985
What is it?

1056
01:16:10,689 --> 01:16:12,680
Straight up Fluid Karma.

1057
01:16:12,758 --> 01:16:16,285
Me and my boys been smuggling
this shit out of Utopia.

1058
01:16:16,362 --> 01:16:19,957
Look. Green, you dream.

1059
01:16:22,167 --> 01:16:25,330
Blue, in an hour you feel new.

1060
01:16:25,404 --> 01:16:27,099
And you can forget
about mellow yellow

1061
01:16:27,172 --> 01:16:28,639
and agent orange, 'cause, hey...

1062
01:16:30,142 --> 01:16:32,610
I'm giving you blood red.

1063
01:16:37,716 --> 01:16:38,842
Do you bleed?

1064
01:16:40,986 --> 01:16:42,886
I said, do you bleed?

1065
01:16:44,490 --> 01:16:45,855
Yeah, yeah, dog.

1066
01:16:46,859 --> 01:16:48,793
Then you take the blood train.

1067
01:16:50,362 --> 01:16:52,387
You talk to God

1068
01:16:52,464 --> 01:16:55,490
without even...
without even seeing Him.

1069
01:16:55,567 --> 01:16:57,728
You hear His voice,

1070
01:16:57,803 --> 01:17:00,271
and you see His disciples.

1071
01:17:00,339 --> 01:17:01,966
They appear like...

1072
01:17:03,308 --> 01:17:06,141
angels under a sea
of black umbrellas.

1073
01:17:07,679 --> 01:17:10,546
Angels who can see through time.

1074
01:17:24,096 --> 01:17:25,154
Thanks, dog.

1080
01:18:42,341 --> 01:18:47,574
<i>Yeah, don't you put me
on the backburner</i>

1081
01:18:47,646 --> 01:18:52,049
<i>you know you got

1082
01:18:52,117 --> 01:18:54,415
<i>You're going to bring us all down</i>

1083
01:18:54,486 --> 01:18:55,976

<i>You're going to bring us all down</i>

1089
01:19:10,702 --> 01:19:14,661

1090
01:19:14,740 --> 01:19:18,676
<i>Last call for sin</i>

1091
01:19:18,744 --> 01:19:20,609

<i>The battle is won</i>

01:19:41,500 --> 01:19:44,162

<i>For billions of years,

Hi, Krysta.

1109
01:22:03,041 --> 01:22:04,065
Zora.

1110
01:22:06,178 --> 01:22:07,167
Come on in.

1111
01:22:14,753 --> 01:22:15,777
Penetrating.

1112
01:22:17,622 --> 01:22:18,953
It's just a suggestion.

1113
01:22:20,292 --> 01:22:22,055
So what do you want?

1114
01:22:22,127 --> 01:22:24,891
We're filming my reality webcast
before the party.

1115
01:22:25,964 --> 01:22:27,124
Can I score some drugs?

1116
01:22:30,335 --> 01:22:31,495
Sure you can, kitten.

1117
01:22:38,877 --> 01:22:42,608
<i>Pandora's box had been
left exposed to prying eyes.</i>

1118
01:22:58,663 --> 01:23:00,392
How did you get this?

1119
01:23:05,103 --> 01:23:06,593
Hey, over here.

1120
01:23:07,639 --> 01:23:09,231
What's with the getup?

1121
01:23:09,307 --> 01:23:11,901
I've got the tape
of me and Boxer in my bag.

1122
01:23:11,977 --> 01:23:13,467
And what are you going to do with it?

1123
01:23:14,746 --> 01:23:16,338
I'm thinking of going public with it.

1124
01:23:16,414 --> 01:23:19,383
I mean, fuck it, this could impact
the entire election.

1125
01:23:19,451 --> 01:23:21,942
There's a website
that everyone's talking about.

1126
01:23:22,020 --> 01:23:23,885
Someone's routing
outside of USIDent,

1127
01:23:23,955 --> 01:23:26,355
and the government
cannot figure out how to shut it out.

1128
01:23:26,424 --> 01:23:27,413
What's it called?

1129
01:23:27,492 --> 01:23:31,656
Www. usideath. org.

1130
01:23:32,230 --> 01:23:34,198
How do I get this to the webmaster?

1131
01:23:34,266 --> 01:23:37,531
Oh, it's the Neo-Marxists. They've
put drop boxes all over the city.

1132
01:23:37,602 --> 01:23:39,433
I think there's one in the poopdeck.

1133
01:23:40,472 --> 01:23:42,201
Okay, get Sheena and Deena

1134
01:23:42,274 --> 01:23:44,105
and meet them in Hermosa
with the cameras.

1135
01:23:44,176 --> 01:23:45,165
Let's do this.

<i>Pilot Abilene is accused

1142
01:24:04,196 --> 01:24:07,757
<i>UPU units prepare for violence

1143
01:24:27,853 --> 01:24:28,842
Give me the gun.

1144
01:24:37,462 --> 01:24:38,451
I need your help.

1145
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:43,929
I need you to help me

1146
01:24:47,839 --> 01:24:48,828
Okay.

1147
01:24:56,414 --> 01:24:57,608
Put on your seatbelt.

1148
01:25:04,456 --> 01:25:07,619
Well, Deep Throat Two,
I presume.

1149
01:25:21,606 --> 01:25:23,369
It's the only copy?

1150
01:25:23,441 --> 01:25:25,636
I don't work in distribution.

1151
01:25:25,710 --> 01:25:28,008
Yes, that's the only copy.

1152
01:25:28,079 --> 01:25:31,014
Oh, please, I'd like
to ask you a few questions.

1153
01:25:32,384 --> 01:25:35,217
Go ahead, ask away.

1154
01:25:35,287 --> 01:25:37,084
How do you sleep at night?

1155
01:25:38,089 --> 01:25:40,353
Very well, thank you very much.

1156
01:25:40,425 --> 01:25:42,859
That is, until I hear
screams from next door

1157
01:25:42,928 --> 01:25:45,624
because USIDent
is raiding my neighbor's house,

1158
01:25:45,697 --> 01:25:47,289
based on false information

1159
01:25:47,365 --> 01:25:50,095

your friend endorsed.

1160
01:25:50,168 --> 01:25:53,467
You ever lose someone close to you,
a loved one, in a terrorist attack?

1161
01:25:53,538 --> 01:25:54,527
'Cause I have.

1162
01:25:57,409 --> 01:25:59,775
This may come as a shock to you,
Mr. Smallhouse,

1163
01:25:59,844 --> 01:26:02,438
but I lost two people in Abilene...

1164
01:26:02,514 --> 01:26:04,778
two of my four ex-husbands,
on a fishing trip,

1165
01:26:04,849 --> 01:26:06,976
which they took every year
to bitch about me.

1166
01:26:10,822 --> 01:26:12,949
What are you going to do
with all that free money?

1167
01:26:13,959 --> 01:26:16,257
I'm going to distribute
my documentary film,

1168
01:26:16,328 --> 01:26:20,162
help some women in the Middle East
get some more civil liberties.

1169
01:26:20,865 --> 01:26:22,560
Do you know
what those two words mean?

1170
01:26:22,634 --> 01:26:24,295
"Civil liberties"?

1171
01:26:25,470 --> 01:26:26,698
You ought to write them down.

1172
01:26:26,771 --> 01:26:30,263
You know what? You're going
to go down, Cyndi Pinziki.

1173
01:26:31,443 --> 01:26:33,536
That's right,
I know your real name.

1174
01:26:35,847 --> 01:26:38,645
You know,
I wasn't going to do this,

1175
01:26:38,717 --> 01:26:40,742
but I feel very generous today.

1176
01:26:40,819 --> 01:26:43,583
I'm going to leave you
with a little present.

1177
01:26:43,655 --> 01:26:48,922
Wow. I am flattered.
What is it?

1178
01:26:48,994 --> 01:26:51,224
- A Taser gun to the balls.
- What?

1179
01:26:53,898 --> 01:26:56,560
You should know that
there's another tape out there,

1180
01:26:56,634 --> 01:27:00,035
a far more incriminating tape
featuring your pal,

1181
01:27:00,105 --> 01:27:01,629
Boxer Santaros,
and a double murder,

1182
01:27:01,706 --> 01:27:03,731
and it's going to cost
a lot more than a million

1183
01:27:03,808 --> 01:27:06,140
to get your hands on that one,

1184
01:27:06,211 --> 01:27:08,475
because when
all is said and done,

1185
01:27:08,546 --> 01:27:11,515
nobody rocks the cock
like Cyndi Pinziki.

1186
01:27:21,426 --> 01:27:23,690
Eat shit, you fucker!

1187
01:27:23,762 --> 01:27:26,094
Whoa, yeah!

1188
01:27:40,145 --> 01:27:42,136

She stole the tape

1192
01:27:47,986 --> 01:27:50,045
She's going to go
pranked on with it.

1193
01:27:51,356 --> 01:27:54,348
She probably thinks
it's the footage of her and... - what?

1194
01:27:54,426 --> 01:27:56,792
Oh, eat a dick, Pinziki,
eat a dick!

1195
01:27:57,829 --> 01:27:58,818
What?

1196
01:27:58,897 --> 01:28:01,024
She just told me to eat a dick.

1197
01:28:01,099 --> 01:28:02,999
She's going completely fucking off.

did not address</i>

1208
01:29:01,793 --> 01:29:04,227
<i>was the rising gas prices
starting to threaten</i>

1209
01:29:04,295 --> 01:29:06,957
<i>the GDP of the California economy.</i>

1210
01:29:15,907 --> 01:29:17,067
<i>Several small earthquakes</i>

1211
01:29:17,142 --> 01:29:19,269
<i>have been reported
off the coast of Santa Monica,</i>

1212
01:29:19,344 --> 01:29:20,971
<i>each increasing in magnitude.</i>

1213
01:29:21,045 --> 01:29:23,605
<i>Seismologists
are warning Southland residents</i>

1214
01:29:23,681 --> 01:29:25,342
<i>of another massive earthquake,</i>

1215
01:29:25,416 --> 01:29:27,543
<i>noting tidal disturbances
emanating</i>

1216
01:29:27,619 --> 01:29:30,679
<i>from the Utopia Three facility
on the Pacific coast.</i>

1217
01:29:30,755 --> 01:29:32,222
<i>I felt a premonition.</i>

1218
01:29:34,526 --> 01:29:36,687
<i>Danger was on the horizon.</i>

1219
01:30:02,854 --> 01:30:03,980
Man, this is great.

1220
01:30:06,090 --> 01:30:08,320
Shit, Boxer Santaros.

1221
01:30:10,628 --> 01:30:12,255
Jericho Kane.

1222
01:30:13,798 --> 01:30:16,232
The information that I've uncovered
could get me killed,

1223
01:30:16,301 --> 01:30:18,861
but it was a risk I was willing to take.

1224
01:30:20,038 --> 01:30:23,201
The fate of the world
depends on you, Jericho.

1225
01:30:24,509 --> 01:30:25,942
Yes.

1226
01:30:26,010 --> 01:30:28,069
You must board the MegaZeppelin.

1227
01:30:28,146 --> 01:30:32,480
The secret you are looking for is
hidden in the Baron's private chamber.

1228
01:30:33,051 --> 01:30:34,746
What is the secret?

1229
01:30:34,819 --> 01:30:37,811
There's a dead body
they've retrieved from the desert.

1230
01:30:37,889 --> 01:30:40,722
They found the body in your car.

1231
01:30:47,765 --> 01:30:49,426
Did I kill someone out there?

1232
01:30:52,337 --> 01:30:53,827
They're listening.

1233
01:30:54,906 --> 01:30:56,533
They're watching.

1234
01:30:58,776 --> 01:31:03,110
If you should succeed,
remember me, my love.

1235
01:31:03,181 --> 01:31:05,172
Remember my name.

1236
01:31:07,619 --> 01:31:08,711
I will.

1237
01:31:09,954 --> 01:31:10,943
L...

1238
01:31:11,923 --> 01:31:14,050
I want to suck your dick.

1239
01:31:20,732 --> 01:31:24,259
If you don't let me suck your dick,
I'm going to kill myself.

1240
01:31:27,572 --> 01:31:30,040
W- w... wait.
Wait, wait, wait. Wait.

1241
01:31:33,411 --> 01:31:34,810
<i>Target locked.</i>

1242
01:31:34,879 --> 01:31:39,213
Take your pants off right now,
or I'm going to pull the trigger.

1243
01:31:48,793 --> 01:31:50,158
Take them off.

1244
01:31:50,728 --> 01:31:51,922
Okay.

1245
01:31:53,631 --> 01:31:54,859
Jericho Kane...

1246
01:31:56,301 --> 01:31:58,269
is going to make your wish
come true...

1247
01:31:59,604 --> 01:32:01,196
and turn you into a new woman.

1248
01:32:02,907 --> 01:32:06,741
We could rent a room at Shutters.
It's my favorite place.

1249
01:32:25,294 --> 01:32:30,561
All right, we are trailing
Zora Charmichaels and Bart Bookman.

1250
01:32:30,633 --> 01:32:32,863
They are driving a silver pickup truck

1251
01:32:32,935 --> 01:32:35,927
<i>looking to rendezvous
with Krysta Kapowski,</i>

1252
01:32:36,005 --> 01:32:42,877
<i>a. k. a. Krysta Now,
blonde, 5'4", 110 pounds.</i>

1253
01:32:42,945 --> 01:32:45,072
<i>Apparently there is
a tape in her possession.</i>

1254
01:32:45,147 --> 01:32:47,377
<i>That is the target.</i>

1255
01:33:08,037 --> 01:33:10,403
There's here car.
Bitch.

1256
01:33:10,472 --> 01:33:12,804
All right, now it's on.
Let's go.

1257
01:33:12,875 --> 01:33:15,673
God, this is
so revolutionary, Krysta.

1258
01:33:15,744 --> 01:33:16,733
We have a Steadicam.

1259
01:33:16,812 --> 01:33:19,406
I know, but when I said Steadicam,
I didn't a My First Steadicam.

1260
01:33:19,481 --> 01:33:21,574
I want a real one,
like a real movie.

1261
01:33:21,650 --> 01:33:24,847
I mean, TV show,
but it's like a movie.

1262
01:33:24,920 --> 01:33:28,117
You know,
these kind of new technologies

1263
01:33:28,190 --> 01:33:30,215
are totally changing culture now.

1264
01:33:30,292 --> 01:33:32,920
Yeah, especially now
that everything is digital.

1265
01:33:32,995 --> 01:33:34,428
That sausage makes me hungry.

1266
01:33:43,839 --> 01:33:49,607
Right down there, to the right,
behind the toilet, feed the hole.

1267
01:33:58,654 --> 01:33:59,814
Oh, yeah.

1268
01:33:59,888 --> 01:34:01,879
- Do you see this scene?
- Yeah.

1269
01:34:01,957 --> 01:34:04,289
- It feels good.
- It's hot.

1270
01:34:29,518 --> 01:34:31,418
Sir, those people
are trying to kill me.

1271
01:34:36,258 --> 01:34:37,282
Whoa.

1272
01:34:39,862 --> 01:34:42,092
Get the fuck out of my way,
you bitch.

1273
01:34:42,164 --> 01:34:43,153
Do you know who we are?

1274
01:34:57,346 --> 01:34:59,541
- What's your hurry, bitch?
- Oh, don't you...

1275
01:35:00,949 --> 01:35:03,213
Anybody else
want to take a swing at me?

1276
01:35:04,887 --> 01:35:08,846
Krysta, it's the wrong tape,
you stupid whore.

1277
01:35:09,858 --> 01:35:11,291
Come on and get me, fucks.

1278
01:35:25,040 --> 01:35:26,598
Fascist pigs.

1279
01:35:34,416 --> 01:35:35,713
Oh, my God!

1280
01:35:37,219 --> 01:35:38,413
Go, go!

1281
01:35:41,223 --> 01:35:42,554
Why did I buy this car?

1282
01:35:42,624 --> 01:35:43,648
Come on.

1283
01:35:50,065 --> 01:35:53,228
<i>Grid nine zero two

01:35:59,241 --> 01:36:00,902
<i>- Hey, hey.
- Boxer.</i>

1286
01:36:00,976 --> 01:36:03,103
I'm at 26th Street,
on The Strand, okay?

1287
01:36:03,178 --> 01:36:04,440
Okay, bye.

1288
01:37:13,315 --> 01:37:17,081
<i>Fortunio was
on the Baron's payroll all along.</i>

1289
01:37:20,222 --> 01:37:22,622
Put him up. Put him up.

1290
01:37:24,159 --> 01:37:26,423
<i>His orders
were to deliver the specimen</i>

1291

01:37:35,404 --> 01:37:36,462
Up, up, up.

1293
01:37:38,707 --> 01:37:39,696
Watch it.

1294
01:37:45,113 --> 01:37:47,013
There's no turning back now.

1295
01:37:47,082 --> 01:37:48,549
You're a good friend.

1296
01:37:51,019 --> 01:37:52,748
<i>Cyndi had obtained a ticket</i>

<i>Unfortunately,

1299
01:38:08,070 --> 01:38:10,061
<i>Darkness fell upon the city.</i>

1300

<i>Neo-Marxist cells

<i>with a memorial concert

<i>Eliot will attend

So why do you want to kill yourself?

1318
01:39:24,479 --> 01:39:25,844
I got drafted, dog.

1319
01:39:27,215 --> 01:39:30,912
I got to go to Iraq,
maybe Syria.

1320
01:39:32,754 --> 01:39:34,085
I can't take that shit.

1321
01:39:35,891 --> 01:39:38,485
I'd rather put a bullet
in my head quick and painless.

1322
01:39:40,629 --> 01:39:41,823
Fallujah.

1323
01:39:44,132 --> 01:39:45,360

That's none of your business.

That's where

Yo, I don't have a visa, dog.

1329

Well, as they say,

There is a path to end all suffering.

How long will the website be active

<i>I'll give you all that I have,

<i>Now I know

<i>But I know that

why we're going on</i>

1376
01:45:00,081 --> 01:45:01,070
Thank you.

1377
01:45:18,099 --> 01:45:21,830
<i>I don't wanna be sad</i>

1378
01:45:23,872 --> 01:45:27,865
<i>I don't wanna be scared</i>

1379
01:45:29,677 --> 01:45:33,704
<i>I don't wanna be sad</i>

1380
01:45:36,084 --> 01:45:39,542
<i>I don't wanna be scared</i>

1381
01:45:41,656 --> 01:45:45,456
<i>I don't wanna be sad</i>

1382
01:45:47,328 --> 01:45:51,321
<i>I don't wanna be scared</i>

1383
01:45:53,568 --> 01:45:57,664
<i>I don't wanna be sad</i>

1384
01:45:59,607 --> 01:46:02,906
<i>I don't wanna be scared</i>

1385
01:46:05,213 --> 01:46:09,513
<i>I don't wanna be sad</i>

1386
01:46:11,352 --> 01:46:14,753
<i>I don't wanna be scared</i>

1387
01:46:17,258 --> 01:46:20,694
<i>I don't' wanna be sad</i>

1388
01:46:23,331 --> 01:46:27,199
<i>I don't wanna be scared</i>

1389
01:46:28,937 --> 01:46:32,168
Mr. Boxer Santaros
has arrived.

1390
01:46:32,240 --> 01:46:33,901
Excellent.

1391
01:46:44,252 --> 01:46:45,241
How does it end?

1392
01:46:48,790 --> 01:46:50,087
A handshake.

1393
01:46:55,697 --> 01:46:58,427
I had a dream last night
that you died.

1394
01:47:01,636 --> 01:47:02,625
Mr. Santaros.

1395
01:47:03,638 --> 01:47:06,539
Your presence
is requested in the Marx Suite.

1396
01:47:06,608 --> 01:47:07,768
Alone.

1397
01:47:19,287 --> 01:47:20,982
I'm not going to die.

1398
01:47:57,492 --> 01:47:58,686
<i>...he was on fire.</i>

1399
01:47:58,760 --> 01:48:00,193
<i>The surrounding stores,</i>

1400
01:48:00,761 --> 01:48:04,356
<i>you could see people running
in and out of the broken windows.</i>

1401
01:48:04,432 --> 01:48:05,831
<i>What is going on...</i>

1402
01:48:05,900 --> 01:48:08,334
<i>And there's another...
another explosion just took off</i>

1403
01:48:08,402 --> 01:48:11,565
<i>down... right down there
off of Third Street.</i>

1404
01:49:07,995 --> 01:49:09,895
<i>Revelation 22...</i>

1405
01:49:11,365 --> 01:49:14,027
<i>"Very soon now
shall I be with you again...</i>

1406
01:49:15,703 --> 01:49:19,104
<i>"bringing the reward
to be given to every man</i>

1407
01:49:19,173 --> 01:49:21,733
<i>according to what he deserves. "</i>

1408
01:49:26,214 --> 01:49:29,809
Mr. Santaros,
welcome to the Marx Suite.

1409
01:49:30,818 --> 01:49:33,582
Now, Simon says
lower your sidearm, please.

1410
01:49:35,289 --> 01:49:37,280
Are you just deaf
or willfully stupid?

1411
01:49:37,358 --> 01:49:40,384
I told you to lower
that fucking sidearm!

1412
01:49:43,030 --> 01:49:44,122
And there you go.

1413
01:49:45,366 --> 01:49:46,697
Well, come on in.

1414
01:49:52,640 --> 01:49:54,801
<i>They're trying to rig the election.</i>

1415
01:49:54,876 --> 01:49:57,276
California is too close to call.

1416
01:49:57,345 --> 01:49:59,506
All... all right, sweetheart,
whatever you say.

1417
01:50:01,649 --> 01:50:03,549
Why isn't she here?

1418
01:50:04,852 --> 01:50:06,251
She won't leave her post.

1419
01:50:06,320 --> 01:50:09,187
It is time for a surgical strike.

1420
01:50:16,864 --> 01:50:19,264
I can smell you
from down the hall.

1421
01:50:22,003 --> 01:50:23,664
No. Not now, Dennis.

1422
01:50:28,209 --> 01:50:30,700
The Neo-Marxists
have infiltrated USIDent.

1423
01:50:30,778 --> 01:50:32,871
She has to leave there immediately.

1424
01:50:32,947 --> 01:50:34,972
It's okay. She has
everything under control.

1425
01:50:35,049 --> 01:50:37,017
We need to get her out of there.

1426
01:50:37,084 --> 01:50:40,485
<i>There are thousands, probably
tens of thousands of protesters</i>

1427
01:50:40,554 --> 01:50:42,351
<i>all up and down the street</i>

1428
01:50:42,423 --> 01:50:45,017
<i>and spreading out
into the surrounding arteries</i>

1429
01:50:45,092 --> 01:50:47,026
<i>coming in
toward the downtown area.</i>

1430
01:50:47,094 --> 01:50:53,431
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you the Treer MegaZeppelin.</i>

1431
01:51:11,085 --> 01:51:15,522
The project was called
Serpentine Dream Theory.

1432
01:51:15,589 --> 01:51:18,717
The Tidal Generator
within Utopia Three

1433
01:51:18,793 --> 01:51:22,285
has achieved
simulated perpetual motion.

1434
01:51:22,363 --> 01:51:24,991
The impact of this achievement

1435
01:51:25,066 --> 01:51:28,399
has slowed the acceleration
of the planet to such a degree

1436
01:51:28,469 --> 01:51:33,372
that certain environmental anomalies
have started to surface.

1437
01:51:33,441 --> 01:51:37,070
One of these anomalies,
discovered earlier this year,

1438
01:51:37,144 --> 01:51:40,045
was a rift in the fourth dimension.

1439
01:51:40,114 --> 01:51:42,412
A rift in the fabric of space-time...

1440
01:51:43,617 --> 01:51:45,380
half a kilometer wide.

1441
01:51:46,754 --> 01:51:49,222
Located on the outskirts
of Lake Mead.

1442
01:51:54,428 --> 01:51:57,226
Yes, Mr. Santaros.

1443
01:51:57,798 --> 01:52:01,256
Just like you imagined
in your screenplay.

1444
01:52:02,703 --> 01:52:04,000
And what did we do

1445
01:52:04,071 --> 01:52:06,869
once we discovered a rift
in the fourth dimension?

1446
01:52:08,976 --> 01:52:10,876
We launched monkeys into it.

1447
01:52:17,718 --> 01:52:20,585
Only a human subject
could survive that jaunt.

1448
01:52:22,923 --> 01:52:24,720
The soul of a monkey

1449
01:52:24,792 --> 01:52:27,124
can't survive
the dimensional threshold.

1450
01:52:29,163 --> 01:52:31,063
So we learned,

1451
01:52:31,132 --> 01:52:34,033
at which point the Baron decided

1452
01:52:34,101 --> 01:52:39,095
that the first human subject
to travel through the rift

1453
01:52:39,173 --> 01:52:42,199
would be a movie star.

1454
01:52:42,276 --> 01:52:43,834
Why me?

1455
01:52:43,911 --> 01:52:47,108
Your celebrity
and your political ties

1456
01:52:47,181 --> 01:52:51,140
proved an irresistible combination.

1457
01:52:52,987 --> 01:52:54,511
As the satellite photos show,

1458
01:52:54,588 --> 01:52:57,751
at approximately 10:51 a. M...

1459
01:52:57,825 --> 01:53:02,159
and this is 69 minutes
before you passed through the rift...

1460
01:53:02,229 --> 01:53:05,198
a duplicate Boxer Santaros
appeared.

1461
01:53:06,300 --> 01:53:10,862
You traveled 69 minutes
back in time, sir,

1462
01:53:10,938 --> 01:53:13,668
at which point your future self...

1463
01:53:15,476 --> 01:53:19,207
and your past self
confronted one another.

1464
01:53:21,615 --> 01:53:24,641
So I'm my future self.

1465
01:53:26,287 --> 01:53:28,619
And I'm the dude
who traveled through the rift.

1466
01:53:29,623 --> 01:53:34,356
And this is all that's left
of your past self.

1467
01:53:41,102 --> 01:53:45,402
This body, this artifact,

1468
01:53:45,473 --> 01:53:50,843
this dual existence
of a single human soul

1469
01:53:50,911 --> 01:53:55,075
could unlock the secret of creation,
the secret of humankind.

1470
01:53:59,487 --> 01:54:00,749
I don't understand.

1471
01:54:02,790 --> 01:54:05,486
I've never considered
committing suicide.

1472
01:54:12,533 --> 01:54:13,795
I'm a pimp.

1473
01:54:15,936 --> 01:54:19,099
And pimps don't commit suicide.

1474
01:54:21,242 --> 01:54:25,872
We don't know what would happen
if two identical human souls

1475
01:54:25,946 --> 01:54:28,471
and the vessels that they travel in

1476
01:54:28,549 --> 01:54:32,713
were to come into immediate
close contact with one another.

1477
01:54:35,156 --> 01:54:38,853
<i>Indy 103.1... the independent FM.
Fourth of July weekend...</i>

1478
01:54:38,926 --> 01:54:40,518
Where did you get this?

1479
01:54:42,530 --> 01:54:44,020
Pilot Abilene.

1480
01:54:44,198 --> 01:54:45,756
Pilot Abilene?

1481
01:54:48,135 --> 01:54:49,159
Do you bleed?

1482
01:55:02,116 --> 01:55:04,949
<i>You can fly so bloody</i>

1483
01:55:06,020 --> 01:55:08,955
<i>What happened
in Fallujah was an accident.</i>

1484
01:55:09,023 --> 01:55:11,355
<i>They called it friendly fire,</i>

1485
01:55:11,425 --> 01:55:13,757
<i>and Private Taverner
could not forgive himself</i>

1486
01:55:13,827 --> 01:55:15,317
<i>for what he had done to me.</i>

1487
01:55:15,396 --> 01:55:17,057
Yo, dog, where are we headed?

1488
01:55:18,432 --> 01:55:19,899
Somewhere downtown.

1489
01:55:22,203 --> 01:55:23,431
We have to go downtown.

1490
01:55:27,107 --> 01:55:28,404
He's in an ice cream truck.

1491
01:55:31,445 --> 01:55:32,810
Wow, I can feel it.

1492
01:55:36,483 --> 01:55:39,384
<i>There is automatic weapon fire,
we understand,</i>

1493
01:55:39,453 --> 01:55:41,478
<i>down on the ground,

1494
01:55:43,224 --> 01:55:46,421
<i>...the power and the kingdom
of your God...</i>

1495
01:55:52,366 --> 01:55:56,166
Yo, dog, I'm going
to empty out my account...

1496
01:55:57,171 --> 01:55:58,729
take everything I got.

1497
01:56:01,375 --> 01:56:02,569
Neat.

Yo, what... what do I do?

1507
01:56:39,013 --> 01:56:41,777
We're going to take

1508
01:56:47,054 --> 01:56:50,785
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,

<i>O'er the ramparts we watched

<i>And the rockets'red glare</i>

1514
01:58:05,666 --> 01:58:11,229
<i>The bombs bursting in air</i>

1515
01:58:11,305 --> 01:58:16,072
<i>Gave proof through the night</i>

1516

<i>That our flag was still there</i>

1517

01:59:31,218 --> 01:59:32,207
<i>Uh-oh, wait.</i>

1525
01:59:32,286 --> 01:59:34,880
<i>Apparently we've lost
contact with Sky Cam.</i>

1526
01:59:34,955 --> 01:59:37,048
<i>As you could see
just before we lost the picture,</i>

1527
01:59:37,124 --> 01:59:39,251
<i>a lot of people downtown,
a lot of activity,</i>

<i>all kinds of problems.</i>

01:59:40,394 --> 01:59:42,555
<i>- Please stay indoors.
- Stay inside.</i>

1530
01:59:42,629 --> 01:59:46,429
<i>And, you know, we're getting
information that the Neo-Marxist...</i>

1531
02:00:19,433 --> 02:00:20,422
You know.

1532
02:00:26,273 --> 02:00:29,868
You know exactly what happened
out in the desert.

1533
02:00:34,882 --> 02:00:37,407
Who did the Baron hire
to kidnap me?

1534
02:00:38,418 --> 02:00:41,148
And who drove me
through the time rift?

1535
02:00:49,596 --> 02:00:51,962
You haven't figured that out yet?

1536
02:00:52,032 --> 02:00:54,432
What is his name?

1537
02:00:56,603 --> 02:00:59,470
Officer Roland Taverner.

1538
02:01:07,648 --> 02:01:11,982
Officer Roland Taverner.
How are you?

1539
02:01:33,240 --> 02:01:34,468
Ice cream truck.

1540
02:01:45,085 --> 02:01:46,780
Teri?

1541
02:01:54,561 --> 02:01:57,587
Teri, you've gone too far.

1542
02:01:57,664 --> 02:01:59,655
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
we seem to be having...</i>

1543
02:01:59,733 --> 02:02:00,722
Is he still alive?

1544
02:02:06,106 --> 02:02:07,698
In more ways than one.

1545
02:02:16,316 --> 02:02:20,377
You made sure Taverner
went through the time rift with me.

1546
02:02:21,388 --> 02:02:26,189
Then you hit the SUV
self-destruct trigger, by remote,

1547
02:02:26,259 --> 02:02:27,783
which means...

1548
02:02:28,795 --> 02:02:32,822
I didn't kill myself.

1549
02:02:37,204 --> 02:02:38,694
You're a pimp.

1550
02:02:39,773 --> 02:02:42,674
Pimps don't commit suicide.

1551
02:02:42,743 --> 02:02:44,108
Oh, you got that right.

1552
02:02:45,112 --> 02:02:48,570
And Roland Taverner...
and his twin brother...

1553
02:02:49,583 --> 02:02:52,518
they're the same person,
aren't they?

1554
02:02:56,156 --> 02:03:01,219
Two identical souls
walking the face of the earth,

1555
02:03:01,294 --> 02:03:04,730
coexisting in the same
dominion of chaos.

1556
02:03:13,640 --> 02:03:19,135
What will happen
if they shake hands?

1557
02:03:22,949 --> 02:03:25,383
The fourth dimension
will collapse upon itself.

1558
02:03:27,921 --> 02:03:29,320
You stupid bitch.

1559
02:03:35,762 --> 02:03:38,322
<i>Again, don't be alarmed,
but stay inside.</i>

1560
02:03:44,805 --> 02:03:46,568
The ocean is in control.

1561
02:03:47,674 --> 02:03:51,041
<i>...the rioting continues downtown,
and it's a problem right now</i>

1562
02:03:51,111 --> 02:03:53,375
<i>because it looks like
the crowds are growing.</i>

1563
02:03:53,447 --> 02:03:56,041
<i>Even though we no longer
have contact with our chopper,</i>

1564
02:03:56,116 --> 02:03:58,380
<i>we do understand it was
the Neo-Marxist movement</i>

1565
02:03:58,452 --> 02:03:59,783
<i>that started these riots.</i>

1566
02:03:59,853 --> 02:04:03,619
<i>They're continuing to move
throughout downtown Los Angeles...</i>

1567
02:04:03,690 --> 02:04:06,625
And this is the tower of fire.

1568
02:04:08,095 --> 02:04:09,926
We have to evacuate.

1569
02:04:09,996 --> 02:04:11,987
What in God's name
are you talking about?

1570
02:04:22,509 --> 02:04:24,704
There he is. Let's go.

1571
02:04:27,614 --> 02:04:30,481
<i>We've got automatic weapons fire
at Fourth Street and Hill.</i>

1572
02:04:30,550 --> 02:04:32,177
<i>I think they're already inside.</i>

1573
02:04:32,252 --> 02:04:34,516
<i>Recommend open fire
into the crowd.</i>

1574
02:05:07,120 --> 02:05:08,212
No.

1575
02:05:19,065 --> 02:05:20,259
Run!

1576
02:05:26,940 --> 02:05:28,908
Yo, yo, dog, you all right?

1577
02:05:31,812 --> 02:05:33,302
Well done, soldier.

1578
02:05:47,093 --> 02:05:49,061
Take that target.

1579
02:05:50,964 --> 02:05:52,522
You can't miss.

1580
02:06:10,717 --> 02:06:12,548
Come on, let's go, let's go!

1581
02:06:15,555 --> 02:06:19,355
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Krysta Now,</i>

1582
02:06:19,426 --> 02:06:24,261
<i>Shoshanna Cox,
Sheena Gee, and Deena Score.</i>

1583
02:06:24,331 --> 02:06:28,768
<i>They are
the Memory Gospel Dancers.</i>

1584
02:06:30,470 --> 02:06:32,461
Let's... let's leave right now.

1585
02:06:32,539 --> 02:06:34,530
This guy right here
might never leave.

1586
02:09:15,935 --> 02:09:17,459
It had to be this way.

1587
02:09:18,705 --> 02:09:20,002
I know.

1588
02:10:16,196 --> 02:10:17,686
He's going to die.

1589
02:10:18,932 --> 02:10:20,490
There's nothing
we can do about it?

1590
02:10:22,001 --> 02:10:24,561
Is it some kind of an orgy
or something?

1591
02:10:24,637 --> 02:10:25,865
What the hell's he doing?

1592
02:10:52,599 --> 02:10:56,933
Evacuate the atrium.
Move to the rear of the MegaZeppelin.

1593
02:10:57,003 --> 02:10:57,992
No.

1594
02:10:58,071 --> 02:11:01,438
Everybody, go back to your seats.

1595
02:11:01,508 --> 02:11:04,033
Or I kill myself,
and I swear to God...

1596
02:11:05,845 --> 02:11:07,039
I'll do it.

1597
02:11:12,919 --> 02:11:14,113
We have to let go.

1598
02:11:15,855 --> 02:11:16,913
I can't.

1599
02:11:16,990 --> 02:11:18,719
You have to let me go.

1600
02:11:23,730 --> 02:11:26,062
But the truck will fall,
and we'll both die.

1601
02:11:27,500 --> 02:11:29,798
Let me go,
or I'll pull this fucking trigger!

1602
02:11:29,869 --> 02:11:32,099
- No, you won't.
- I swear to God I'll do it!

1603
02:11:32,172 --> 02:11:33,196
No, you won't.

1604
02:11:59,165 --> 02:12:02,999
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
the party is over.</i>

1605
02:12:03,069 --> 02:12:05,731
<i>Have a nice apocalypse.</i>

1606
02:12:09,042 --> 02:12:10,976
Put down the gun.

1607
02:12:17,550 --> 02:12:19,177
This is all in my head.

1608
02:12:19,252 --> 02:12:22,653
I can pull the trigger now
and wake up.

1609
02:12:22,722 --> 02:12:25,122
This whole nightmare
will be over.

1610
02:12:25,191 --> 02:12:29,457
Our mission
is to destroy capitalism.

1611
02:12:31,231 --> 02:12:33,199
Dethrone God.

1612
02:12:34,367 --> 02:12:36,130
Officer Roland Taverner.

1613
02:12:38,538 --> 02:12:40,267
That's who you want.

1614
02:12:43,543 --> 02:12:45,272
Don't you remember, Ronald?

1615
02:12:48,381 --> 02:12:49,848
Do you remember Fallujah?

1616
02:12:52,685 --> 02:12:54,118
I remember everything.

1617
02:13:19,512 --> 02:13:23,846
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the way the world ends.</i>

1618
02:13:26,019 --> 02:13:28,954
<i>Not with a whimper,
but with a bang.</i>

1619
02:13:34,994 --> 02:13:36,154
<i>But there is hope.</i>

1620
02:13:36,229 --> 02:13:41,326
<i>In the end we can be reassured
by one undeniable truth.</i>

1621
02:13:41,401 --> 02:13:45,030
<i>Nobody rocks the cock
like Krysta Now.</i>

1622
02:13:47,573 --> 02:13:49,234
<i>And I mean nobody.</i>

1623
02:13:50,576 --> 02:13:53,943
I knew that son of a bitch was crazy.
Get me out of here.

1624
02:15:04,484 --> 02:15:05,678
It wasn't our fault.

1625
02:15:09,822 --> 02:15:11,050
It wasn't our fault.

1626
02:15:14,527 --> 02:15:15,721
Friendly fire.

1627
02:15:17,096 --> 02:15:18,620
I forgive you.

1628
02:15:18,698 --> 02:15:20,859
Friendly fire.

1629
02:15:20,933 --> 02:15:22,662
- I forgive you.
- Friendly fire.

1630
02:15:22,735 --> 02:15:24,134
- Friendly fire.
- I forgive you.

1631
02:15:24,203 --> 02:15:26,398
- Friendly fire.
- I forgive you.

1632
02:15:28,274 --> 02:15:29,400
I forgive you.

1633
02:15:31,477 --> 02:15:32,671
I forgive you.

1634
02:15:33,679 --> 02:15:35,271
<i>Revelation 21...</i>

1635
02:15:36,649 --> 02:15:39,618
<i>And God wiped away
the tears from his eyes,</i>

1636
02:15:39,685 --> 02:15:43,177
<i>so the new messiah could see
out to the New Jerusalem.</i>

1637
02:15:44,624 --> 02:15:47,184
<i>His name was
Officer Roland Taverner</i>

1638
02:15:47,260 --> 02:15:49,455
<i>of Hermosa Beach, California...</i>

1639
02:15:52,598 --> 02:15:54,532
<i>my best friend.</i>

1640
02:16:02,208 --> 02:16:03,402
<i>He is a pimp...</i>

1641
02:16:04,410 --> 02:16:09,473
<i>and pimps don't commit suicide.</i>

1642
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:13,093
