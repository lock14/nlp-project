00:00:49,735 --> 00:00:53,465
It's like to walk in the fictional country 
joking is upside down!

4
00:00:54,045 --> 00:00:56,206
Do you think so  then you feel?

5
00:00:58,249 --> 00:01:00,466
Death is like breathing pure oxygen!

6
00:01:01,866 --> 00:01:03,240
A life?

7
00:01:04,065 --> 00:01:06,818
It's like looking for the output, 
and you're trapped in the wrong house.

8
00:01:08,221 --> 00:01:11,595
How do you know to be able to udahnnes ses air 
again until you die?

9
00:01:11,894 --> 00:01:13,926
Because I'll be outside my body.

10
00:01:15,163 --> 00:01:17,011
Buoy and I wiill be free.

11
00:01:17,948 --> 00:01:19,083
How do you know?

12
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:21,249
How do you know that it will not be worse?

13
00:01:22,724 --> 00:01:24,489
I know it will be better than this.

14
00:01:26,037 --> 00:01:27,626
You do not know it, Nancy!

15
00:01:30,164 --> 00:01:34,120
What if death, as you say, is 
leaving your body but not your soul?

16
00:01:34,906 --> 00:01:36,598
What if you stay stuck in your soul?

17
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:38,773
What then?

18
00:01:39,331 --> 00:01:41,827
Then I was free andd I will be free!

19
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:45,402
If you can release there, 
why not get rid of here?

21
00:02:35,546 --> 00:02:36,904

25
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,587
If you bring it?  
- What? This?

26
00:04:52,043 --> 00:04:57,323
You think you can not deal with that? 
- I do not know! Can you?

27
00:04:58,332 --> 00:05:00,512
Well saznajmo!

28
00:05:23,025 --> 00:05:25,562
You know you have to Tailand 
two types of dog food?

29
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,322
Is that!  
- Yes.

30
00:05:27,574 --> 00:05:30,192
One is if you just want to nahranis dog 
the other is if you plan to eat it!

31
00:05:30,946 --> 00:05:32,300
Have you heard this?

Yes, the remains of  the house tonight.

00:05:59,164 --> 00:06:01,925
5 is and will remain so. There will be nothing better!

37
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,782
The best would be  to go to sleep.

38
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:11,426
I do not want to talk ... no 
I  do not want to talk about it!

39
00:06:16,857 --> 00:06:19,408
Listen, I'll call you later! Valid?

I was a little cold!

45
00:07:15,428 --> 00:07:17,633
No, it's perfect!

46
00:07:24,117 --> 00:07:27,000
Are there any room? 
- What?

00:07:27,236 --> 00:07:30,247

00:07:43,008 --> 00:07:46,408
Well, I'll relax 
in the next 45 minutes!

50
00:07:46,746 --> 00:07:50,100
I'll be here, the player! Where will you be?

51
00:07:50,421 --> 00:07:53,432
In an airport? In noisy 
family gathering?

52
00:07:53,701 --> 00:07:56,558
I will keep the baby? Sleeping next to someone 
on the bench?

53
00:07:56,969 --> 00:08:00,256
Or ... You will be here!

54
00:08:00,801 --> 00:08:02,578
On your personal  site for golf!

55

With the elegancee of this sport.

57
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:11,445
There are eight such courts in 
U.S. and Canada.

58
00:08:13,114 --> 00:08:15,745

Good luck!

00:08:20,398 --> 00:08:22,503
I'm really wondering 
Albert. Really impressed!

60
00:08:24,107 --> 00:08:28,781
You must drink a minimum of two  drinks 
price of pizza is $ 7!

61
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,234
The first drink is free.

62
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:34,781
That would be all over the country!

63
00:08:35,996 --> 00:08:37,388
I am thrilled!

64
00:08:37,676 --> 00:08:40,093

00:08:50,536 --> 00:08:53,986
For the dealers  will be great!

68
00:08:54,432 --> 00:08:56,547
Yes!

69
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:01,855
What are your back?

70
00:09:02,835 --> 00:09:04,998
I've got thrills in the legs.

71
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:08,225
I can not sleep at night! 
- I always go to the gym?

72
00:09:08,597 --> 00:09:10,062
Two times  a week.

73
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:14,713
If you want something serious, let me know.

74
00:09:14,993 --> 00:09:16,878
I know someone who you can get 
whatever you want!

75
00:09:17,133 --> 00:09:19,941
Well, you tell him that  
you get a new zaivot!

76
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:24,915
Where's Nancy?? I lost it!

77
00:09:25,845 --> 00:09:29,416
Moved to digital entity?

78
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,322
Nancy was in Baltimmore with friends.

79
00:09:34,086 --> 00:09:35,356
Tomorrow is  returned.

80
00:09:36,335 --> 00:09:38,232
Who still has friends in Baltimore?

81
00:09:45,649 --> 00:09:48,327
It is not the same.

82
00:09:49,528 --> 00:09:53,150
Sometimes it's good to be 
separate from each other, so you can ...

83
00:09:54,272 --> 00:09:56,968
Restore the magic!

84
00:10:01,171 --> 00:10:03,494
After the car wash,

85
00:10:04,132 --> 00:10:07,402
I returned and got ... a message!

86
00:10:07,928 --> 00:10:11,671
What kind of message? 
- It has  decided to stay with friends.

87
00:11:56,154 --> 00:11:58,148
Hello?

88
00:12:00,273 --> 00:12:02,662
No, I told you

89
00:12:04,508 --> 00:12:05,788
Yes!

90
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,328
Good. Hello!

91
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,814
It's good!

92
00:13:30,332 --> 00:13:33,266
Do you need company?

93
00:13:34,651 --> 00:13:37,919

No, with that, amp;quott;if you need company?

95
00:13:41,676 --> 00:13:45,291
I think that just because I'm your man.

96
00:13:45,982 --> 00:13:48,179
Do you need company?  
- Yes, of course!

97
00:13:48,554 --> 00:13:50,348
Well you see, you and you did my man!

98
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:55,520
Damnn!

99
00:13:56,051 --> 00:13:57,880
How many others are there?

100
00:14:00,087 --> 00:14:03,209
Too many to count, 
a bunch of loser.

101
00:14:05,707 --> 00:14:08,007
What? 
- How do you know that I am not?

102
00:14:09,577 --> 00:14:11,655
Women's intuition?

103
00:14:13,346 --> 00:14:16,039
We will need something to 
wear for my big finale!

104
00:14:17,761 --> 00:14:19,372
Of course!

105
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:27,193
Your body and your mind are  
sinhrinizovani golf shot.

106

Feel the  moment!

111
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:50,219
Hold your view of the ball ...

112
00:14:50,642 --> 00:14:52,834
And visualize its trajectory.

113
00:14:53,672 --> 00:14:56,166
Be the ball! 
-- Be the ball!

114
00:14:57,425 --> 00:15:00,261
Be the ball! 
-- Be the ball!

115
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:03,098

00:15:11,789 --> 00:15:13,065
Be the  ball!

119
00:15:45,204 --> 00:15:49,482
Do you think that you can not remember ... 
acccurate feeling that you've gone through ...

120
00:15:50,287 --> 00:15:53,040
Before you felt the need to hurt yourself?

121
00:15:53,928 --> 00:15:55,780
Yes. Nothing.

122
00:15:58,848 --> 00:16:00,523
What do you  feel now?

123
00:16:01,069 --> 00:16:02,832
I feel with the smoke ...

124
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:10,182
Can you remember your thoughts  
you went through your head?

125
00:16:15,001 --> 00:16:17,914
Sometimes I think about my unclee, 
sometimes on the Albert ...

126
00:16:18,193 --> 00:16:20,659
Sometimes I'm angry! 
- What  do you think of the uncle?

127
00:16:20,979 --> 00:16:24,021
Oto how much he loved me! 
-- Your uncle has hurt you!

128
00:16:25,013 --> 00:16:26,880
It's me in that  way he liked.

129
00:16:28,501 --> 00:16:31,976
You realize you love someone 
povreedjivati does not mean it! Right?

130
00:16:32,234 --> 00:16:34,008
Can we at least agree about that?

131
00:16:35,298 --> 00:16:38,828
If I let you love me in 
way that he wanted ...

132
00:16:39,232 --> 00:16:41,346
I showed him  I love him.

133
00:16:44,552 --> 00:16:49,868
Are you a feared? 
- Wee played a lot, laugh!

134
00:16:50,104 --> 00:16:52,041
A game and also caused the pain!

135
00:16:52,835 --> 00:16:54,288
Yes!

136
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:58,725
Felt you were accepted while you are playing?

137
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:00,980
Yes!

138
00:17:07,572 --> 00:17:08,826
So ....

139
00:17:10,691 --> 00:17:13,339
So the injury of themselvess or 
injury by others ..

140
00:17:13,597 --> 00:17:15,329
Makes you feel honored!

141
00:17:16,308 --> 00:17:17,894
It seems to feel.

142
00:17:25,266 --> 00:17:26,969
Have you ever injured Albert?

143
00:17:34,111 --> 00:17:38,668
Can you describe how it looks 
making love with Albert?

144
00:17:39,605 --> 00:17:41,121
Yes!

145
00:17:42,168 --> 00:17:46,012
The last time we did  
masturbirao by me.

146
00:17:48,354 --> 00:17:50,262
Do not write this.

147
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:56,210
What do you  think now?

148
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:58,880
Soy repulsiva

149
00:18:01,996 --> 00:18:04,361
Albert ponasane has nothing to do with you.

150
00:18:05,364 --> 00:18:07,280
We're not talking about you.

151
00:18:09,795 --> 00:18:12,303
You are a beautiful woman 
You are an intelligent woman, Nancy ...

152
00:18:14,152 --> 00:18:16,234
No, I can not always be 
what we want to be,

153
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:18,236
what we want when we can be!

154
00:18:19,824 --> 00:18:21,358
Take  it?

155
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:29,760
Well, it's hard to believe that this  
company exists for over 15 years!

156
00:18:31,977 --> 00:18:34,465
15 years is a long time!

157
00:18:35,775 --> 00:18:37,808
I know?

158
00:18:38,198 --> 00:18:43,574
To create a long, 
need rain, you need the sun.

159
00:18:45,102 --> 00:18:48,528
At the end of the rainbow are something!

160
00:18:48,864 --> 00:18:50,723
Pot of  gold!

161
00:18:52,686 --> 00:18:54,462
I found this cup!

162
00:18:56,081 --> 00:19:00,013
Yes, because the company,

163
00:19:00,684 --> 00:19:04,004
Would not be leading in the state,

164
00:19:04,715 --> 00:19:06,438
That no one man.

165
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:10,525
The man who gave me the money

166
00:19:12,329 --> 00:19:14,578
Who has supported me  when I most needed.

167
00:19:16,702 --> 00:19:19,252
I want to thank 
the  man at the moment!

168
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:22,444
Thank you,, Albert!

169
00:19:25,399 --> 00:19:28,488
Because it was a real good friend 
after all these years!

170
00:19:30,324 --> 00:19:33,073
And to continue this celebration!

171
00:19:33,322 --> 00:19:37,396
My wife, my beautiful wife, 
Jenny annd everyone else come to the podium,

172
00:19:37,706 --> 00:19:40,686
To play a nice slow dance.

173
00:19:50,098 --> 00:19:51,650
Let's  go!

174
00:19:58,224 --> 00:20:00,621
I do not want too play? 
- Yes!

175
00:20:01,754 --> 00:20:03,346
When?

176
00:21:16,605 --> 00:21:18,989
I have to go home! 
- You have to go?

177
00:21:19,224 --> 00:21:21,019
Yes, I do not feel good. I have to go.

178
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,929
You have to go so fast?

179
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,827
You need somee medicine?

180
00:22:31,925 --> 00:22:36,243
Nancy, what are you doing? There in the fun!

181
00:22:41,087 --> 00:22:44,942
What is it? 
- Nothing,, I do not feel good.

182
00:22:45,201 --> 00:22:47,482
I just want to go home.  
- You can not relax?

183
00:22:47,749 --> 00:22:49,298
To come out off this world?

184
00:22:50,884 --> 00:22:53,712
It's not your party, 
but rocks. This is his night!

185
00:22:54,712 --> 00:22:56,661
Did not you can relax, at least tonight?

00:22:59,362 --> 00:23:01,488
Good! You want to go home? Go home!

187
00:23:02,469 --> 00:23:04,078
Here you go!

188
00:23:05,755 --> 00:23:07,992
You know I do not like to drive at night.

189
00:23:09,259 --> 00:23:11,221
I'll call a cab.

190
00:23:25,201 --> 00:23:27,407
I do not know what you got until it ...

191
00:23:41,835 --> 00:23:43,768

192
00:24:08,341 --> 00:24:10,587
We need a few hours to 
come to the hotel and will ...

193
00:24:10,865 --> 00:24:12,904
... Drop in to my 
house to pick up some things.

194
00:24:13,192 --> 00:24:14,865
If this is wrong?

195
00:24:17,719 --> 00:24:19,963
¿Eso es una  margarita?

196
00:24:23,756 --> 00:24:26,132
My gift for the tenth anniversary of Alberta.

197
00:24:26,823 --> 00:24:28,884
Cuvam is close  to the heart.

198
00:24:30,182 --> 00:24:33,406
Keeps memories? 
-- Drained flower.

199
00:24:34,046 --> 00:24:37,192
What is? 
-- Souse.

200
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:44,077
What is it? 
- Nothing.

201
00:24:45,274 --> 00:24:47,076
It's all  right.

202
00:24:54,265 --> 00:24:57,766
You can change your  mind to. 
- What?

203
00:24:59,058 --> 0 0:25:01,450
Nemas courage now?

204
00:25:02,948 --> 00:25:04,318
I came here to do.

205
00:25:04,814 --> 00:25:09,794
Sorry, I only recall that 
able to think about your options.

206
00:25:11,023 --> 00:25:12,746
There is no other option.

207
00:25:13,682 --> 00:25:15,025
Really?

208
00:25:17,314 --> 00:25:19,811
Maybe we should wonder 
whether  this is really what you want!

209
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:23,709
I'm here.

210
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,259
I'll tell you what  you have to know.

211
00:25:45,607 --> 00:25:47,221
This is your collection of video tapes?

212
00:25:49,199 --> 00:25:50,956
You have a whole shelf.

213
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:57,801
What do you have in your bag? 
- Excuse me?

214
00:25:58,453 --> 00:26:01,258
What do you have in your bag? 
-  Do not worry, I got your money!

215
00:26:20,503 --> 00:26:22,084 
Thirsty? 
- What?

216
00:26:22,942 --> 00:26:26,426
Will you something to drink? 
- Yes! Whisky?

217
00:26:49,794 --> 00:26:51,338
That's what I did last week.

218
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:53,781
Broken hours.

219
00:26:55,868 --> 00:26:59,617
I stopped it, and not at all  
remember how it happened.

220
00:27:00,608 --> 00:27:03,520
Amnesia. 
- Yeah, I think about it!

221
00:27:04,457 --> 00:27:05,623
Amnesia!

222
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:08,769

So here are all  actions occur?

228
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:32,151

00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,053
It does not look like her.

We're just now.

00:32:23,078 --> 00:32:25,279
That's right..

277
00:32:25,551 --> 00:32:26,760
Yes?

278
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,912
Feels good, right?

279
00:32:31,655 --> 00:32:33,306
Take it easy,, let's go!

280
00:32:33,924 --> 00:32:36,655

281

Continue,  come on!

00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:13,717
Fun it! 
- Well are you?

285
00:33:14,065 --> 00:33:16,818
Resembling me of my uncle. 
- Is it?

286
00:33:17,281 --> 00:33:19,169
What was he? Blade Runner?

287
00:33:19,819 --> 00:33:21,469
How many years have you 
when you play like this?

288
00:33:23,417 --> 00:33:26,778
- 7 
- It's all explained.

289
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:28,616
You're so fuccking cute.

290
00:33:29,069 --> 00:33:30,327
You're  good!

291
00:33:30,751 --> 00:33:32,701
Yes, we could begin with our work.

292
00:33:33,416 --> 00:33:37,023
En lugar de morir en vano 
es mejor morir con dolor

293
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,396
Can I tell you something really funny?

294
00:33:41,416 --> 00:33:45,057
You know what my mother did when 
I told her that I will never have children?

295
00:33:45,902 --> 00:33:47,554
No??

296
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:51,193
Kept me locked in a room for five days.

297
00:33:51,892 --> 00:33:53,687
And called me  stupid slut.

298
00:33:57,994 --> 00:34:00,823
I guess that is my uncle 
helped by the decision.

299
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:04,434
Her brother? 
- Yes.

300
00:34:05,888 --> 00:34:07,529
It was  good.

301
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:10,551
He was a good one week 
as it was programmed.

302
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:14,899
I thought I wanted children

303
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:18,655
In fact, and is wanted.

304
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,567
Maybe I would if I gave birth to a golf course ...

305
00:34:21,804 --> 00:34:23,609
Albert managed to attract attention.

306
00:34:30,602 --> 00:34:32,613
Do you sometimes ask why you born?

307
00:34:33,222 --> 00:34:36,345
No, I do not wonder that.

308
00:34:38,614 --> 00:34:40,256 
But you know what I  am interested in?

309
00:34:40,906 --> 00:34:42,906
I wonder how the name oof this place here ...

310
00:34:43,394 --> 00:34:44,599
Do not! 
- ... I  do not like it!

311
00:34:44,876 --> 00:34:46,961
I love, what? Do not you love to be beautiful?

312
00:34:53,536 --> 00:34:55,724
OK! What do you think that here we stop playing?

313
00:34:59,406 --> 00:35:00,702
Do not leave me!

314
00:35:15,271 --> 00:35:17,094
To continue with the plan!

315
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:20,042
Did I hear?

316
00:35:29,702 --> 00:35:31,154

Do you know when you back? 
- Actually I do not know.

323
00:35:53,075 --> 00:35:56,471
You see, her contract expires, which means 
which means that it will lose all its data ...

324
00:35:56,711 --> 00:35:57,699
Good.

325
00:35:57,979 --> 00:35:59,485
Well, someone hass her authority?

326
00:35:59,732 --> 00:36:01,134
I am her husband.

You know what?

330
00:36:17,219 --> 00:36:19,508
In Stavri, we  will do it.

331
00:36:19,766 --> 00:36:22,368
They asked me to send some Meili ...

332
00:36:23,512 --> 00:36:25,606
Frankly, I do not know how to do it ...

333
00:36:26,163 --> 00:36:29,505
Well, you can ... can you help me with that?

334
00:36:30,545 --> 00:36:32,403
We'll see what we can  do. 
- Rock and roll

335
00:36:33,032 --> 00:36:34,549
Excellent!

336
00:36:37,964 --> 00:36:39,233
And ....

337
00:36:40,779 --> 00:36:43,194
... To see her system. Computer.

338
00:36:43,419 --> 00:36:45,917
Yes, sorry. I'm a bit absentminded.

339
00:36:46,493 --> 00:36:48,465

340
00:36:54,026 --> 00:36:55,410
Your wife??

341
00:36:56,194 --> 00:36:58,298
You are a lucky man. 
- Yes, I know.

342
00:37:05,401 --> 00:37:06,937
Will it last long?

343
00:37:07,834 --> 00:37:09,926
Let's hope that NESCOM.

344
00:37:13,657 --> 00:37:15,574
You know? It is strange. 
Usually the other way around.

345
00:37:16,224 --> 00:37:17,958
Women are those who want to know 
What do their husbands.

346
00:37:18,195 --> 00:37:19,609
I do not want to know  what my wife is ...

347
00:37:19,874 --> 00:37:21,197
Just want to send a Meile.

348
00:37:22,341 --> 00:37:24,207
Do you know any passwords?

349
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:26,385 
A little to facilitate things.

350
00:37:26,807 --> 00:37:29,219
Some say that it means something ...

351
00:37:30,571 --> 00:37:33,159
For example, her favorite color, flower ...

352
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:37,274
The name of the street where he grew up.

353
00:37:40,073 --> 00:37:41,653
The name of the child.

354
00:37:42,938 --> 00:37:44,605
We do not have  children ...

355
00:37:47,591 --> 00:37:50,051
See, see ...

356
00:37:50,979 --> 00:37:53,783
It seems that Nancy ... 
- My wife?

357
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:55,684
Yes, yes ...

358
00:37:56,383 --> 00:37:59,114
There is no password. No security password.

359
00:38:00,187 --> 00:38:01,859
All odkljucano!  
- Excellent!

360
00:38:02,219 --> 00:38:04,509
So ... what do you want to send and to whom?

361
00:38:10,264 --> 00:38:12,834
You know what? In fact I'm ...

362
00:38:14,622 --> 00:38:15,985
Somehow worried.

363
00:38:17,111 --> 00:38:18,574
Why?

364
00:38:23,084 --> 00:38:24,816
Because my wife! You know, 
she was not at home four days.

365
00:38:25,197 --> 00:38:26,199
I thought I just want to send a post.

366
00:38:28,426 --> 00:38:32,229
Yes, I said so, but ...

367
00:38:33,004 --> 00:38:34,964
I'm trying to find some clue about it 
when visiting, that I could not call.

368
00:38:35,531 --> 00:38:37,770
I guess you do not know a single 
your friend's wife!

369
00:38:43,449 --> 00:38:46,059
I mean, it does not regard me .... 
- No, you are not concerned.

370
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,733
Did you call 911 to see if is not  
Department of Missing Persons?

371
00:38:51,382 --> 00:38:53,424
No, I think that it occurred.

372
00:38:54,631 --> 00:38:56,499
I thought: 
# I'll give it another day.#

373
00:38:59,958 --> 00:39:05,186
Yes, another day ...

374
00:39:06,467 --> 00:39:07,970
Do you know a Farly her precious Farly-a,?

375
00:39:08,217 --> 00:39:10,011
What is thhe name?

376
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:11,681
People use aliases. 
- Yes,, but I know that name ...

377
00:39:13,012 --> 00:39:14,520
What the hell it means #?

378
00:39:17,094 --> 00:39:19,413
What are they?  
- Her Meili.

379
00:39:19,716 --> 00:39:22,066
There are hundreds, it seems that all 
from the same person.

380
00:39:23,428 --> 00:39:26,315
You want to show you how to open it?? 
- Yes! What is it with my name?

381
00:39:26,564 --> 00:39:27,904
Albert, when you read this ... 
- Let's see it ...

382
00:39:31,796 --> 00:39:33,601
Sorry!

383
00:39:35,211 --> 00:39:38,552
Albert, when you read this will be too late.

384
00:39:38,819 --> 00:39:41,344
It's too late for your miserable 
attempts to understand me or ...

385
00:39:42,398 --> 00:39:44,828
... This crappy life that 
should spend together.

386
00:39:45,075 --> 00:39:48,047
It's good that I finally realized,

387
00:39:49,555 --> 00:39:52,126
So I decided to go to you 
I freed myself to this marriage.

388
00:39:53,403 --> 00:39:55,250
I do not blame those that do not love me, 
I feel nauseous when I think about the common bed.

389
00:39:55,911 --> 00:39:58,170
Call it fear or whatever ...

390
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:01,148
But now I have the courage to do 
what's good for me.

391
00:40:02,386 --> 00:40:03,925
To the rest and start izpocetka.

392
00:40:06,672 --> 00:40:07,900
Do not try to find me.

393
00:40:12,019 --> 00:40:13,815
Goodbye,  Albert!

394
00:40:14,372 --> 00:40:17,571
No, it's Nancy ...

395
00:40:18,634 --> 00:40:20,088
It's not Nancy ... 
she writes like this, this is not it.

396
00:40:20,384 --> 00:40:23,212
You'd be surprised whaat all people can be.

397
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:25,783
And what do the people you know.

398
00:40:26,031 --> 00:40:28,288
It can not be it. 
I know, her entire life this thing.

399
00:40:28,535 --> 00:40:32,506
Well, Albert. Maybe she met someone 
because all of this message ...

400
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:36,025
Show that has been or is ... 
in a  very intimate connection with ...

401
00:40:42,388 --> 00:40:44,592
... Other men.

402
00:40:49,777 --> 00:40:52,244
Well you, Albert? 
- Yes!

403
00:40:49,777 --> 00:40:52,244
I'm going to ... sipam own drinks. Will you?

404
00:40:52,705 --> 00:40:54,336
Of course, I would like to 
have a drink with you, Albert.

405
00:40:54,998 --> 00:40:56,896
Hold me here,, everybody.

406
00:40:57,143 --> 00:40:58,763
Odstampacu you this. 
- Valid!

407
00:41:10,512 --> 00:41:11,832
¿Qué improve?

408
00:41:24,329 --> 00:41:26,980
I just thought that my life  
be different, that's all.

409
00:41:29,216 --> 00:41:31,167
What should be?

410
00:41:37,502 --> 00:41:39,746
I do not know that we have twwo, maybe three children ...

411
00:41:40,427 --> 00:41:42,986
Tipican happy marriage.

412
00:41:44,337 --> 00:41:47,896
Do you and Albert once talked 
on how to adopt a child?

413
00:41:50,642 --> 00:41:53,027
Once, before 
I was asked to udeam for him.

414
00:41:53,935 --> 00:41:55,751
How did he  respond?

415
00:41:56,961 --> 00:41:58,761
He said he wants  a Chinese baby.

416
00:42:00,999 --> 00:42:03,795
It seems that Albert 
very  difficult if you listen.

417
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:12,139
What happened then? 
- Suddenly changed.

418
00:42:12,882 --> 00:42:15,757
And then? 
- Cao Chinese.

419
00:42:17,477 --> 00:42:20,072
Are you still sometimes  talked on the subject?

420
00:42:23,465 --> 00:42:24,755
Yess.

421
00:42:25,249 --> 00:42:28,797
Hubble rico de lo quee el pollo preparaba

422
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:33,378
Sounds like the most important issue for Alberta.

423
00:42:34,770 --> 00:42:37,274
Para Albert, Toquue no esa Tecla

424
00:42:37,924 --> 00:42:39,647
Can you to the bathroom, please?

425
00:42:39,964 --> 00:42:41,391
Of course!

426
00:42:42,555 --> 00:42:46,176
I really have too go! 
- Sorry!

427
00:42:46,868 --> 00:42:48,877
I'll give you the key!

428
00:42:51,529 --> 00:42:53,149
Thank you very much!

429
00:43:45,639 --> 00:43:47,033
Are you  okay?

430
00:43:50,367 --> 00:43:52,245
Nancy! Can you open the door?

431
00:43:56,146 --> 00:43:58,357
Nancy, I know you think that  this is a 
the only relief.

432
00:44:00,215 --> 00:44:02,915
The only way to  get rid of ...

433
00:44:05,091 --> 00:44:07,062
But I promise you that we will find 
another way to relax.

434
00:44:07,713 --> 00:44:10,281
Maybe take 
but I know you'll be better.

435
00:44:12,156 --> 00:44:14,085
Statistics gives us hope.

436
00:44:20,412 --> 00:44:21,538 
Nancy, I know ...

437
00:44:22,167 --> 00:44:24,786
I know you feel like it  
and nobody listened.

438
00:44:27,098 --> 00:44:30,347
But I would like you to listen 
and it would like to help you.

439
00:44:35,106 --> 00:44:37,087
Nancy, please let me help you.

440
00:44:38,141 --> 00:44:40,037
What happened, Carol?

441
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,368
Why all  this?

442
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:48,050
I had a feeling that you came 
the stage when ...

443
00:44:48,276 --> 00:44:50,917
- ... want to hurt myself ... 
- So?

444
00:44:51,486 --> 00:44:53,599
I'm fine, I just had to change my tampon.

445
00:44:54,930 --> 00:44:57,602
And now I'm happyy. Happy, happy!

446
00:44:59,247 --> 00:45:00,931
Yes, I  see!

447
00:45:12,187 --> 00:45:14,402
I do not know what you thought that you'll  achieve 
time that you come to my house.

448
00:45:14,732 --> 00:45:16,931
This is my house, idiot! 
My house!

449
00:45:17,570 --> 00:45:18,797
Excuse me? You said something?

450
00:45:22,888 --> 00:45:24,579
You will have to stay here a bit with me, okay?

451
00:45:24,973 --> 00:45:29,088
Maybe take a while 
read the entire November.

452
00:45:39,086 --> 00:45:42,049
I think that I like to eat 
one  of these virtual shit to you.

453
00:45:42,316 --> 00:45:44,018
Let's see whether you like it.

454
00:45:44,369 --> 00:45:45,895
Nucicu to filozofiram.

455
00:45:48,724 --> 00:45:49,884
You're a degenerate.

456
00:45:51,153 --> 00:45:53,339
By the way, as my wife? Is that right?

457
00:45:56,854 --> 00:45:58,410
I want to answer me some questions!

458
00:46:00,967 --> 00:46:02,973
Oh, shit! It's disgusting!

459
00:46:05,507 --> 00:46:07,926 
With all these thoughts in mind, i 
continue to maintain concentration.

460
00:46:08,174 --> 00:46:09,618
It's impresSive, Albert!

461
00:46:11,233 --> 00:46:13,095
I'll give you the answers to what you want.

462
00:46:14,101 --> 00:46:16,396
Ask a Question! 
-  Where's my wife?

463
00:46:16,933 --> 00:46:18,817
Are not you supposed to  be before they asked?

464
00:46:19,084 --> 00:46:20,487
Fuck you! Answer  me a question.

465
00:46:20,764 --> 00:46:22,343
They say that what you do not know 
can not hurt you.

466
00:46:22,571 --> 00:46:24,286
Do you think it is true Albert? 
- Shut up!

467
00:46:25,056 --> 00:46:27,452
What the devil did you have any with my wife?

468
00:46:28,698 --> 00:46:31,061
What do not you  do it, Albert?

469
00:46:32,422 --> 00:46:36,122
Well, well. Spusticu up to your secret  places 
and I izpeci you right there.

470
00:46:36,404 --> 00:46:37,982
Zavezacu your hands that you can not touch.

471
00:46:38,258 --> 00:46:40,076
Y hasta te quemaré 
abrirte agujeros Negros

472
00:46:40,498 --> 00:46:42,375
And you'll continue to whisper #

473
00:46:42,909 --> 00:46:45,554
You know, you're absolutely right. No I 
it worked prokletoj my wife.

474
00:46:45,851 --> 00:46:47,914
Have talked to. 
- I bet it is.

475
00:46:48,173 --> 00:46:49,462
And I know why.

476
00:46:50,122 --> 00:46:53,846
Because I wanted to get rid of suffering, Albert!

477
00:46:54,855 --> 00:46:57,876
You gave her leave, and I am free.

478
00:46:58,301 --> 00:47:00,724
It's wanted. 
- Not that she wanted.

479
00:47:01,014 --> 00:47:02,467
I'm sure you did not want.

480
00:47:03,232 --> 00:47:04,891
This is a wish from me.

481
00:47:06,335 --> 00:47:07,766
Fuck you.

482
00:47:08,890 --> 00:47:12,479
Sablaznjavao're my wife as a damn pedophile.

483
00:47:13,201 --> 00:47:15,355
You wash her brain. It's obvious.

484
00:47:17,644 --> 00:47:20,389
I did it again ... I bled for you

485
00:47:21,936 --> 00:47:24,331
Who is this? 
- Why did not you ask?

486
00:47:25,701 --> 00:47:28,341
Really? Why did not you ask why 
sitting alone in the corner ...

487
00:47:28,868 --> 00:47:30,280
... And bleeding?

488
00:47:31,244 --> 00:47:32,613
You've seen it every day. Right?

489
00:47:32,839 --> 00:47:35,292
It's your nose in front, 
You slept in the same bed.

490
00:47:35,552 --> 00:47:37,285
You were not there  and said nothing.

491
00:47:38,068 --> 00:47:39,945
Not that it touches not at all?

492
00:47:40,223 --> 00:47:43,567
How could you? Why did not you just ask?

493
00:47:43,886 --> 00:47:44,948
Ucutti!

494
00:47:45,227 --> 00:47:47,310
Ucuti? It's the best you know? 
Ucuti?

495
00:47:48,313 --> 00:47:50,457
Ada try with something like Help?

496
00:47:51,108 --> 00:47:52,374
Help!

497
00:47:52,696 --> 00:47:55,201
Let me see if I can understand because if 
I had a chance to go all this again

498
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:58,584
I could not do otherwise. 
- Ucuti!

499
00:47:58,885 --> 00:48:00,771
How can I do to help the person who I mean!

00:48:01,185 --> 00:48:03,299
Where I had to vow! 
- Will you umuknes?

A person who is with me  because 
had a safety!

502
00:48:06,228 --> 00:48:09,014
The person who we believed. 
- Ucuti!

503
00:48:09,251 --> 00:48:12,520
The person who came to you violated 
and you is completely destroyed.

504
00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:14,471
Ucuti, drkadjijo!

505

507
00:48:18,793 --> 00:48:21,371
- It hurts, Albert. 
- You are right that hurts.

508
00:48:23,661 --> 00:48:25,043
Thank  you.

509
00:48:26,485 --> 00:48:27,846
I think I feel closer to you now.

510
00:48:28,205 --> 00:48:30,972
- Worn! 
- It's exciting ...

511
00:48:32,013 --> 00:48:34,922
Wear a lot of pain in you, Albert.

512
00:48:36,387 --> 00:48:38,568

Do you is fun, Albert?

517
00:48:57,051 --> 00:48:58,233
How do you  feel now?

518
00:49:51,195 --> 00:49:53,014
Can you add me so, please?

519
00:50:33,729 --> 00:50:35,367
I will not to put this.

520
00:50:38,945 --> 00:50:40,704
Nothing to me is not clear.

521
00:50:57,197 --> 00:50:58,743
Did you entertain.

522
00:52:03,021 --> 00:52:04,203
- No. 
- Come on.

523
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:06,722
- Do not do it. 
- Tucaj me.

524
00:52:07,298 --> 00:52:10,997
Want me to tucas hard.

525
00:52:12,817 --> 00:52:14,455
I want to.

526
00:52:17,911 --> 00:52:19,943
Is that you want?

527
00:52:23,061 --> 00:52:24,698
Is it good.

528
00:52:26,269 --> 00:52:27,792
It's wanted!

529
00:53:22,062 --> 00:53:24,397
What have you  of all this?

530
00:53:27,465 --> 00:53:29,521
I'll tell you  what I have.

531
00:53:32,550 --> 00:53:33,530
Pain.

532
00:53:33,714 --> 00:53:36,034
- Fuck you. 
- And you.

533
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:41,259
Where's my wife?

534
00:53:42,199 --> 00:53:44,290
She has left you.. You remember?

535
00:53:46,036 --> 00:53:48,220
I still can not find it if you want.

536
00:53:48,888 --> 00:53:51,556
It is still outside, waiting to be found.

537
00:53:55,261 --> 00:53:56,413
Is it good?

538
00:53:58,142 --> 00:54:00,022
And what if it has died?

539
00:54:01,084 --> 00:54:05,388
There lived while she was with you, and Now 
when it is gone once you care?

540
00:54:09,051 --> 00:54:10,053
Is it good?

541
00:54:12,387 --> 00:54:14,025
's Safe.

542
00:54:20,877 --> 00:54:23,909
Well, that's all II wanted to know.

543
00:54:49,494 --> 00:54:51,132
You have beautiful skin.

544
00:54:56,195 --> 00:55:01,439
I want to have sex with you, 
when everything is finished. If you would like it?

545
00:55:21,562 --> 00:55:22,837
Does it hurt? 
- No.

546
00:55:23,292 --> 00:55:24,868
- And this? 
- No.

547
00:55:27,238 --> 00:55:29,482
- You have a beautiful body, you know? 
- No.

548
00:55:31,604 --> 00:55:32,847
It's beautiful.

549
00:55:35,002 --> 00:55:36,395
I want to  open it.

550
00:56:04,884 --> 00:56:07,128
I thought that would  happen last night.

551
00:56:08,404 --> 00:56:11,163
This will be a surprise, as you requested.

552
00:56:13,792 --> 00:56:15,308
And this? I like it?

553
00:56:16,370 --> 00:56:17,360
You like this, tiny?

554
00:56:18,211 --> 00:56:19,667
I think I like him.

555
00:56:36,462 --> 00:56:38,523
What do you think that will be?

556
00:56:45,978 --> 00:56:48,590
Like a dream.

557
00:56:50,651 --> 00:56:54,138
You're over your life 
You have another vision of himself.

558
00:56:55,964 --> 00:56:57,728
As one off them.

559
00:57:00,576 --> 00:57:04,308
It's like you can dises under water.

560
00:57:05,157 --> 00:57:07,680
- What do you think? 
- Nothing.

561
00:57:09,136 --> 00:57:13,318
Now you are here and there, and later 
you swallow the dark.

562
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:18,025
And if you do it?

563
00:57:18,147 --> 00:57:19,696
Not if the question is when.

564
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,372
This will be the end of  everything, you know?

565
00:57:25,615 --> 00:57:27,403
That was our idea was.

566
00:57:35,316 --> 00:57:36,475
Louis.

567
00:57:37,538 --> 00:57:39,030
Nancy?

568
00:57:41,213 --> 00:57:43,306
You want a service that we did?

569
00:57:43,914 --> 00:57:45,702
It depends on how impudent.

570
00:57:48,277 --> 00:57:51,460
Can you kiss me ...

571
00:57:51,583 --> 00:57:53,525
... Gently?

572
00:59:01,812 --> 00:59:03,300
You have one  more wish?

573
00:59:09,393 --> 00:59:12,091
Yes, I have a  few wishes.

574
00:59:15,228 --> 00:59:17,563
I want to be able to feel this.

575
00:59:19,322 --> 00:59:21,748
And ....

576
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:29,327
I want to Albert can feel 
complete solitude ...

577
00:59:29,817 --> 00:59:34,185
You gave me sdusno 
past 15 years of my life.

578
00:59:36,074 --> 00:59:39,105
Every year we celebrated my absence.

579
00:59:41,530 --> 00:59:43,654
I want to be able to feel this.

580
00:59:45,497 --> 00:59:47,864
Maybe then he ...

581
00:59:50,506 --> 00:59:54,659
Maybe you would understand, 
we would have at least something in common.

582
00:59:56,042 --> 00:59:57,528
Do you know what I mean?

583
01:00:00,164 --> 01:00:03,833
Yes, I  know.

584
01:00:23,477 --> 01:00:25,581
Why do you not like meat?

585
01:00:27,370 --> 01:00:28,674
It does nott matter.

586
01:00:34,399 --> 01:00:37,041
I remember a toy shop 
annd I had to choose one.

587
01:00:37,557 --> 01:00:40,649
It was a beautiful, beautiful.

588
01:00:41,862 --> 01:00:43,197
It is still.

589
01:00:43,622 --> 01:00:44,987
- And what happened? 
- Hey ...

590
01:00:47,374 --> 01:00:48,201
None of  that.

591
01:00:49,106 --> 01:00:50,415
- It was not part dogovorao, remember it? 
- I know, I know. I remember that.

592
01:00:50,477 --> 01:00:54,603
But I know a lot about you, 
and  in fact I do not know anything.

593
01:00:55,845 --> 01:00:57,877
Do not worry, 
I will not tell anyone to say.

594
01:01:00,847 --> 01:01:02,209
I have two children, one four, 
one seven years ago.

595
01:01:02,574 --> 01:01:04,636
Really? Boys or girls?

596
01:01:05,598 --> 01:01:06,849
Girl and boy has seven four ..

597
01:01:07,365 --> 01:01:09,943
How come all at once interest 
for my past?

598
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:15,793
Why not? No one will know, 
except me, and I will live for a long ...

599
01:01:16,128 --> 01:01:18,068
So it's not  important.

600
01:01:19,099 --> 01:01:20,766
There is no more what to say.

601
01:01:21,767 --> 01:01:24,072
Errors happen, as  I said earlier.

602
01:01:24,709 --> 01:01:25,801
I??

603
01:01:26,226 --> 01:01:29,651
Mistakes are made, people are injured 
and continue on.

604
01:01:29,956 --> 01:01:31,351 
What mistakes?

605
01:01:34,054 --> 01:01:37,236
How treat people 
how they treat you.

606
01:01:37,512 --> 01:01:39,633
Scars that leave each other.

607
01:01:41,695 --> 01:01:42,999
Blame  her.

608
01:01:44,726 --> 01:01:48,243
- Your mother? 
- Mothers, fathers, women, everything is the same.

609
01:01:55,579 --> 01:01:56,671
Q..

610
01:01:57,853 --> 01:01:59,703
What makes you special?

611
01:02:00,825 --> 01:02:04,372
Why do not prilozis document 
sit in front of a court ...

612
01:02:04,523 --> 01:02:06,498
And to stop it in 
peaceful protest?

613
01:02:09,784 --> 01:02:12,089
- Have I heard you well? 
- Yes you did.

614
01:02:14,562 --> 01:02:16,957
- Fuck you. 
- Maybe, later.

615
01:02:17,079 --> 01:02:18,506
No, fuck you!

616
01:02:19,263 --> 01:02:22,538
Press'm hundreds of miles that I would be  
found with you, not fuck with me!

617
01:02:23,115 --> 01:02:24,237
That was the question.

618
01:02:24,359 --> 01:02:26,210
These would have to wonder why, and this violates.

619
01:02:26,575 --> 01:02:28,643
- I do not want to change. 
- Do you want.

620
01:02:28,827 --> 01:02:30,434
Want me to fuck in mind!

621
01:02:35,496 --> 01:02:37,012
I've had enough  of this life.

622
01:02:37,347 --> 01:02:40,530
Separation will not change any fucking thing.

623
01:02:41,288 --> 01:02:43,563
Do you hear me? To get it?

624
01:02:45,351 --> 01:02:49,322
Because I'd still be here 
here and I do not want to be.

625
01:02:49,567 --> 01:02:54,175
And if you can not accept tthat, 
lost from my life!

626
01:02:58,722 --> 01:03:00,632
What the hell you looking at?

627
01:03:01,785 --> 01:03:04,694
I love that people talk about 
personal matters, right?

628
01:03:05,089 --> 01:03:07,151
Shit! 
Let me, let me!

629
01:03:16,702 --> 01:03:18,189
Nancy,  stop!

630
01:03:23,705 --> 01:03:24,859
I know  you.

631
01:03:27,011 --> 01:03:28,193
I know  you.

632
01:03:33,050 --> 01:03:35,688
Please, Take me  to the hotel.

633
01:03:37,268 --> 01:03:38,279
Good.

634
01:03:40,674 --> 01:03:42,099
Good.

635
01:04:21,011 --> 01:04:22,679
Here you have to make you better.

636
01:04:23,467 --> 01:04:24,985
People like me do  not feel better.

637
01:04:25,925 --> 01:04:30,806
Is it possible that our thoughts 
make tracks and paths in our brain ...

638
01:04:30,961 --> 01:04:36,357
And after repeated negative thoughts 
become comitted to the path ...

639
01:04:37,260 --> 01:04:40,024
That specific repeated stimuli.

640
01:04:40,388 --> 01:04:44,361
And the negative feelings in 
very difficult to redirect.

641
01:04:46,950 --> 01:04:48,163
Are you finished?

642
01:04:49,952 --> 01:04:51,922
It's all a bunch of nonsense.

643
01:04:52,953 --> 01:04:55,621
You have no idea what a real pain.

644
01:04:57,295 --> 01:04:58,597
You have no idea.

645
01:06:00,008 --> 01:06:01,403
I think that you need this.

646
01:06:05,283 --> 01:06:06,587
Maybe you're right.

647
01:06:42,144 --> 01:06:43,207
Hi..

648
01:06:44,146 --> 01:06:46,875
I can not refrain, when you start, 
I do not know to stop.

649
01:06:49,027 --> 01:06:51,208
Do not worry, I'll pick it all!

650
01:08:13,169 --> 01:08:15,110
Sometimes I see the prostitutes.

651
01:08:18,585 --> 01:08:20,343
Spend some time with them.

652
01:08:22,343 --> 01:08:23,556
No chaos.

653
01:08:26,044 --> 01:08:28,165
You think this is bad 
to a dead marriage?

654
01:08:30,924 --> 01:08:32,590
Worn, rubbish.

655
01:08:42,592 --> 01:08:44,472
We could break it, ...

656
01:08:49,996 --> 01:08:53,446
To stop the bye.

657
01:08:56,817 --> 01:09:01,636
Maybe you do not know what to say 
at the right time.

658
01:09:02,970 --> 01:09:04,549
Communication.

659
01:09:07,675 --> 01:09:11,192
This house is perfect, really perfect.

660
01:09:13,375 --> 01:09:15,443
It's all crap.

661
01:09:17,413 --> 01:09:19,596
But here I am  where I am.

662
01:09:20,445 --> 01:09:22,112
I fuck it.

663
01:09:28,852 --> 01:09:31,156
I have a proposal.

664
01:09:35,127 --> 01:09:36,222
What?

665
01:09:36,799 --> 01:09:39,800
If you do something for me, 
I'll tell you where Nancy.

666
01:09:46,893 --> 01:09:48,870
Well, what do you want me to do?

667
01:10:56,168 --> 01:10:57,503
Are you finished?

668
01:10:59,170 --> 01:11:01,388
It's all a bunch of nonsense.

669
01:11:02,631 --> 01:11:07,298
Sedis there, pretend you're a very uvidjajna, 
You make my stupid notes ...

670
01:11:07,513 --> 01:11:09,453
Pretend that you have control.

671
01:11:09,817 --> 01:11:13,727
- What is actually to your crap? 
- Nancy, you are now very upset.

672
01:11:14,638 --> 01:11:16,032
Yes, I am upset.

673
01:11:16,308 --> 01:11:18,610
I am very, very angry.

674
01:11:20,459 --> 01:11:21,618
What is  this?

675
01:11:22,407 --> 01:11:24,437
We are a small therapist does not know what to do ...

676
01:11:24,621 --> 01:11:26,683
Without their writings.

677
01:11:27,628 --> 01:11:29,629
Why do you need all this when you  even 
do not even know who I am?

678
01:11:30,084 --> 01:11:31,418
All right,, Nancy.

679
01:11:32,004 --> 01:11:35,641
Let's see what psychotherapist 
has to say now about mad Nancy.

680
01:11:37,127 --> 01:11:38,856
#The patient is now hostile moodamp #

681
01:11:38,892 --> 01:11:40,531
No bullshit. 
This is a very perceptive of you.

682
01:11:40,836 --> 01:11:42,777
# The patient feels lonely and does not want #

683
01:11:43,111 --> 01:11:45,021
Give it too Nancy.

684
01:11:46,968 --> 01:11:50,606
Acute deterioration sense of self-consciousness.

685
01:11:51,243 --> 01:11:53,219
From the book you pulled this definition?

686
01:11:55,510 --> 01:11:56,814
Oh, here is a good.

687
01:11:57,755 --> 01:11:59,755
# The patient feels unattractive #

688
01:12:01,246 --> 01:12:04,701
There it is your feelings, Nancy,, 
not about what actually did.

689
01:12:05,611 --> 01:12:08,006
Let me ask you something, psychotherapist.

690
01:12:08,310 --> 01:12:10,644
Where did you get your  
fucking credibility?

691
01:12:11,069 --> 01:12:14,252
Well, I think that'ss enough for today.

692
01:12:14,587 --> 01:12:16,921
- Do not want to help me? 
- Yes I would, Nancy, ...

693
01:12:17,012 --> 01:12:20,561
But I can not help you if you  
do not want to help myself.

694
01:12:23,804 --> 01:12:25,744
Carol, and I never saw this.

695
01:13:07,305 --> 01:13:08,366
Hello?

696
01:13:27,879 --> 01:13:29,850
- Hi. 
- Here it is.

697
01:13:31,912 --> 01:13:33,092
You arrrived.

698
01:13:34,991 --> 01:13:36,506
Hi, Albert.

699
01:13:38,416 --> 01:13:41,720
I used a shower above, 
help me for circulation.

700
01:13:42,449 --> 01:13:43,752
Thanks for the shirt.

701
01:13:45,723 --> 01:13:47,814
Albert told us 
You were  that he did a service.

702
01:13:47,936 --> 01:13:49,605
Yes, this is what fell upon?

703
01:13:51,814 --> 01:13:53,149
As my mother?

704
01:13:54,574 --> 01:13:56,545
- It's all right. 
- Is that right?

705
01:13:58,577 --> 01:13:59,607
- You want pizza? 
- No, thanks.

706
01:13:59,852 --> 01:14:01,095
- Cocktails? 
- No, thanks.

707
01:14:06,612 --> 01:14:07,249
No, thanks.

708
01:14:08,341 --> 01:14:09,166
Yes.

709
01:14:10,135 --> 01:14:12,779
Albert, can I tell you 
something about this place?

710
01:14:13,538 --> 01:14:15,751
You know that I have never been down  here, 
I heard a little about him.

711
01:14:15,782 --> 01:14:18,421
It's ... it's you.

712
01:14:20,319 --> 01:14:23,775
In every sense off the fantastic.

713
01:14:24,140 --> 01:14:27,959
I do not know how much work and passion 
has been invested in this area.

714
01:14:28,113 --> 01:14:30,211
This room is truly impressive.

715
01:14:30,333 --> 01:14:31,912
I am impressed.

716
01:14:32,216 --> 01:14:34,096
I deprived time for sure.

717
01:14:34,187 --> 01:14:37,740
In order to turn out this good must be  spent 
a lot of time down here I am.

718
01:14:38,953 --> 01:14:40,712
Obviously not enough.

719
01:14:41,107 --> 01:14:42,773
It's all in balance.

720
01:14:43,623 --> 01:14:46,927
It's easy for you to say. 
Albert has not reached your 7980th

721
01:14:48,110 --> 01:14:50,231
Yes, you have to leave this, Albert.

722
01:15:01,295 --> 01:15:04,932
Louis, do you have  family, children?

723
01:15:06,175 --> 01:15:07,721
Girl of seven and  a boy of four years.

724
01:15:08,448 --> 01:15:10,302
But I have not seen them for years.

725
01:15:14,853 --> 01:15:16,157
Why?

726
01:15:17,552 --> 01:15:19,492
My ex-wife will not let me.

727
01:15:20,068 --> 01:15:21,856
They declared me unfit.

728
01:15:23,918 --> 01:15:25,191
Okay.

729
01:15:27,525 --> 01:15:30,254
Tell us where you  are you two met.

730
01:15:30,605 --> 01:15:32,697
In fact, I met Nancy,, 
on the Internet.

731
01:15:33,062 --> 01:15:36,942
Really? Interesting. 
Something related to the job?

732
01:15:37,124 --> 01:15:38,762
No, no, not at all.

733
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:43,371
- We have common interests. 
- Ah, well.

734
01:15:46,220 --> 01:15:47,213
Is it back?

735
01:15:48,122 --> 01:15:49,129
No..

736
01:15:49,765 --> 01:15:51,161

737
01:15:52,737 --> 01:15:54,252

738
01:15:56,648 --> 01:15:59,134
- There's been days. 
- Yes, I know.

739
01:16:01,104 --> 01:16:04,329
- Have you called police? 
- No, I did not.Why do not you 

740
01:16:05,216 --> 01:16:07,579
-? 
- I do not know.

741
01:16:09,278 --> 01:16:10,370
Do not you know?

742
01:16:11,946 --> 01:16:13,643
Yes, I  know.

743
01:16:16,377 --> 01:16:18,043
Where is she?

744
01:16:21,591 --> 01:16:25,561
I was released, Albert. 
So he wanted.

745
01:19:05,438 --> 01:19:06,590
Hi mate.

746
01:19:06,895 --> 01:19:07,917
You cried?

747
01:19:08,949 --> 01:19:10,313
No..

748
01:19:12,253 --> 01:19:13,952
- Safe are you? 
- Am.

749
01:19:14,377 --> 01:19:16,438
Why would otherwise cry?

750
01:19:17,802 --> 01:19:18,924
That's my girl.

751
01:19:39,625 --> 01:19:43,505
I want to make love last time 
and I want it to be now.

752
01:19:45,900 --> 01:19:47,204
I thought I do not want to know when it will be.

753
01:19:48,635 --> 01:19:50,241
I changed my mind.

754
01:19:51,818 --> 01:19:54,975
I want to do as you say, 
as we agreed.

755
01:19:56,638 --> 01:19:57,819
You heard me?

756
01:20:01,862 --> 01:20:03,046
Yes, I heard you.

757
01:21:48,224 --> 01:21:49,316
Wow.

01:21:53,171 --> 01:21:54,414
Want  me?

759
01:21:56,293 --> 01:21:57,414
I want  you.

01:22:09,812 --> 01:22:13,120

01:23:02,008 --> 01:23:03,796
Do you want to kill me when I am in this dress?

766
01:23:08,494 --> 01:23:09,525
No..

767
01:23:11,465 --> 01:23:12,708
I do not want  to kill you.

Listen!

771
01:23:21,018 --> 01:23:25,687
You came to me with this idea, 
and to me it is no longer realistic.

772
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:29,361
- No. 
- You're a moron.

Over fucking computer?

This is the reality. 
Look at me!
