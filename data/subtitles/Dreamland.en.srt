00:02:19,366 --> 00:02:20,200
Audrey!

5
00:02:21,243 --> 00:02:22,643
Your diploma.

6
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:28,490
You worked hard for it.
I'm very proud of you.

7
00:02:47,853 --> 00:02:49,983
- Congratulations!
- Thanks.

8
00:02:52,524 --> 00:02:54,644
- Come on.
- Okay ...

9
00:02:55,194 --> 00:02:58,613
My perfect boyfriend
would be very dear.

10
00:02:58,614 --> 00:03:04,394
And cute. I had to look
with Jesus or Bob Marley.

11
00:03:05,037 --> 00:03:09,749
And would have to have principles. Would not
hear that damn rock KDUDE.

12
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,959
And I had to smell the
Jolly Ranchers.

13
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,970
- Jolly Ranchers?
- Jolly Ranchers Apple.

14
00:03:17,049 --> 00:03:18,689
Call me Calista.

15
00:03:18,884 --> 00:03:19,717
Sorry?

16
00:03:19,718 --> 00:03:22,555
Calista. I do not want to be Cindy.
Call me Calista.

17
00:03:22,556 --> 00:03:25,223
I'll change my name to
Calista.

18
00:03:25,224 --> 00:03:28,142
- Calista?
- Yes is not sexy?

19
00:03:28,143 --> 00:03:32,153
Calista Bliss ...
Sounds pornographic actress.

20
00:03:32,606 --> 00:03:34,806
- I know.
- Fantastic.

21
00:03:39,655 --> 00:03:43,366
Sipping morning visions that
look like crushed velvet.

22
00:03:43,367 --> 00:03:47,537
Desiring to drink a shaded
with peach aroma and a touch of lilac.

23
00:03:47,538 --> 00:03:52,168
a delightful time to worship
a quiet tongue

24
00:03:52,744 --> 00:03:54,210
... and be ice.

25
00:03:54,211 --> 00:03:57,922
- This is fantastic.
- It's about my father.

26
00:03:57,923 --> 00:04:02,760
- How is he? - Evil Sit
bad for having failed to graduate.

27
00:04:02,761 --> 00:04:06,639
But fine by me.
Nor was waiting for him to succeed.

28
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,270
I was not expecting it
could stand.

29
00:04:12,521 --> 00:04:15,690
Woke up this morning and felt my arm
law completely numb.

30
00:04:15,691 --> 00:04:20,771
As if lifeless,
and I was going through me,

31
00:04:21,857 --> 00:04:23,364
and thought it was time, you know?

32
00:04:23,365 --> 00:04:26,115
- Calista ...
- But I'm fine.

33
00:04:26,785 --> 00:04:29,595
I slept on it for a joke.

34
00:04:37,421 --> 00:04:41,741
I'm just scared because
one of these days ...

35
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:47,470
You know, I'm not just
sleeping poorly on him.

36
00:04:47,638 --> 00:04:51,078
I'll just succumb. It will be like.

37
00:04:58,692 --> 00:05:01,192
Please support me always.

38
00:05:11,872 --> 00:05:13,672
- Hello, Dad.
- Hello

39
00:05:18,712 --> 00:05:19,546
Father ..

40
00:05:20,692 --> 00:05:22,882
You're all crooked and
late

41
00:05:22,883 --> 00:05:26,427
but I thought it was an occasion
that deserves a cake.

42
00:05:26,428 --> 00:05:30,473
Well, it's fantastic. Ate some
when I get back, okay?

43
00:05:30,474 --> 00:05:31,404
Okay.

44
00:05:41,527 --> 00:05:44,207
- Thanks, dear.
- Bye.

45
00:05:55,999 --> 00:05:58,960
Change this song, please.
You are annoying me.

46
00:05:58,961 --> 00:06:00,962
No, it's my turn to choose.

47
00:06:00,963 --> 00:06:04,090
Come on! Let's find music tanned
to dance.

48
00:06:04,091 --> 00:06:05,961
Para, I do not dance.

49
00:06:09,388 --> 00:06:13,538
You need a ride home,
tonight?

50
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:37,610
You do not smoke.

51
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:39,855
- Calista.
- Who?

52
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,938
Cindy is now called Calista.

53
00:06:41,939 --> 00:06:44,130
The doctor told him
I could not smoke,

54
00:06:44,131 --> 00:06:45,673
then asked me to start
to see how it was.

55
00:06:45,674 --> 00:06:47,164
Great confusion.

56
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:52,305
The guru will have another
Circus drums on Saturday.

57
00:06:52,306 --> 00:06:54,182
- I can not go.
- Why?

58
00:06:54,183 --> 00:06:57,560
"The guru"? They are a bunch of dudes
white dreadlocks with bongos.

59
00:06:57,561 --> 00:06:59,812
Do you mind a little
open, you know that?

60
00:06:59,813 --> 00:07:03,399
- What are you afraid?
- I'm not afraid of anything. Just do not want to go.

61
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,526
- Cindy can come.
- Who?

62
00:07:05,527 --> 00:07:09,677
- Calista. She can come.
- Just do not want to go.

63
00:07:09,907 --> 00:07:12,575
Can you give me a ride tomorrow
also, if you want.

64
00:07:12,576 --> 00:07:14,926
- I do not want.
- Okay.

65
00:07:16,914 --> 00:07:19,504
- I'm kidding.
- Bye.

66
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:23,183
Let me give you a lift to
home tomorrow.

67
00:07:23,672 --> 00:07:24,506
Very.

68
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,094
Audrey!

69
00:07:33,263 --> 00:07:35,681
You get a lot of mail,
girl.

70
00:07:35,682 --> 00:07:37,332
Thanks, Dreamer.

71
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,845
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

72
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:49,819
Give a kiss to your mother
for me, dear.

73
00:08:54,928 --> 00:08:56,798
We love you, Mom

74
00:09:02,454 --> 00:09:03,314
Thanks.

75
00:09:12,446 --> 00:09:13,776
- Hello
- Hello

76
00:09:16,842 --> 00:09:17,772
Oh cake!

77
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:23,998
So honey, what did you
tonight?

78
00:09:23,999 --> 00:09:25,958
Your father was there to smoke a joint
with my aunt,

79
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:29,086
so I lay down and listen to the
talking about movies.

80
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,630
And you, you had with Abraham?

81
00:09:30,631 --> 00:09:32,351
- Yes.
- Was it good?

82
00:09:33,425 --> 00:09:37,815
Was normal. Just Friends
to enjoy sex.

83
00:09:38,472 --> 00:09:41,292
- And that's healthy?
- Sure.

84
00:09:42,142 --> 00:09:45,603
I wrote that column
sex free newspaper,

85
00:09:45,604 --> 00:09:49,440
And she says she is fine, since
that is mutual and enjoyer and

86
00:09:49,441 --> 00:09:51,613
to be honest with one another.

87
00:09:51,665 --> 00:09:53,867
The most likely is going to help us
in our future sex lives.

88
00:09:54,821 --> 00:09:59,033
I mean, I like him very much, you know?
But do not walk seriously.

89
00:09:59,034 --> 00:10:02,828
- Yes, but he know that?
- He is completely nuts.

90
00:10:02,829 --> 00:10:06,199
He's all "Love without compromise .."

91
00:10:07,584 --> 00:10:09,784
"Love without compromise."

92
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:11,690
This is good.

93
00:10:21,424 --> 00:10:22,258
Audrey!

94
00:10:41,493 --> 00:10:43,203
I saw him first.

95
00:10:44,329 --> 00:10:46,749
I've seen. Were back.

96
00:10:48,127 --> 00:10:49,959
Seriously, folks.
Where are we going?

97
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:55,500
What are you doing?
What are you doing to my fingers?

98
00:10:58,468 --> 00:11:01,637
- What is it?
- We have new neighbors.

99
00:11:01,638 --> 00:11:03,188
One of them is good.

100
00:11:04,975 --> 00:11:07,555
Put it anywhere.

101
00:11:17,237 --> 00:11:20,156
- Warm, but it's a dry heat.
- That's true.

102
00:11:20,157 --> 00:11:21,017
Thanks.

103
00:11:21,742 --> 00:11:24,619
- Henry Sinclair.
- Herb Myerson.

104
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:27,872
He chose a good place to stay.
Dreamland.

105
00:11:27,873 --> 00:11:30,143
Dreamland?
Toma.

106
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:34,003
The Calista is that there
thinks you're good.

107
00:11:34,004 --> 00:11:34,864
Thanks?

108
00:11:35,547 --> 00:11:36,381
See?

109
00:11:36,423 --> 00:11:40,570
- Where do you work?
- Welding under water.

110
00:11:40,571 --> 00:11:41,405
Really?

111
00:11:41,941 --> 00:11:44,680
I used to work in Texas
oil fields. Hello?

112
00:11:44,681 --> 00:11:47,558
- This is Mary.
- Henry.

113
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:51,562
My wife died and the
Audrey, that girl

114
00:11:51,563 --> 00:11:56,192
on the porch, living with me
here in the desert ever since.

115
00:11:56,193 --> 00:11:58,463
I am sorry for his wife.

116
00:11:59,655 --> 00:12:04,042
If the Lissa you were here, you'd have a lot
candy tomorrow morning on the porch.

117
00:12:04,043 --> 00:12:07,153
Put some M & M's and shit.

118
00:12:07,913 --> 00:12:13,253
- I hope you settle for a few beers.
- Yes, of course.

119
00:12:29,476 --> 00:12:32,456
- Pass me, I'm free.
- Hello

120
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,899
Do not want to wake anyone.

121
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,800
Imaginary ball ... you see?

122
00:12:40,737 --> 00:12:41,977
That's cute.

123
00:12:44,741 --> 00:12:49,453
- Hello Dreamer, Have you found anything?
- Not yet. I warn you.

124
00:12:49,454 --> 00:12:50,384
Okay.

125
00:12:50,998 --> 00:12:55,628
- Are you looking for aliens.
- Have you found any?

126
00:12:55,752 --> 00:12:57,462
From time to time.

127
00:13:00,048 --> 00:13:03,092
Ever seen that
episode of Jerry Springer

128
00:13:03,093 --> 00:13:05,428
where a woman goes into labor
live birth?

129
00:13:05,429 --> 00:13:08,799
- I think so ...
- She lived here.

130
00:13:08,974 --> 00:13:09,824
Really?

131
00:13:10,225 --> 00:13:12,226
Not very funny.
Happens to be sad ...

132
00:13:12,227 --> 00:13:15,354
It's sad for the baby because
're doomed, right?

133
00:13:15,355 --> 00:13:18,649
It is also sad for us because
strengthens

134
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:21,402
stereotype of all that
park campers.

135
00:13:21,403 --> 00:13:23,972
Sorry, I'm talking about
the elbows.

136
00:13:23,973 --> 00:13:26,032
Once knew a guy who
was on "Cops."

137
00:13:26,033 --> 00:13:28,009
- Really?
- Yes, seriously.

138
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:31,700
I played with a guy who was stopped
in a stolen car in the "Police".

139
00:13:31,701 --> 00:13:33,873
- He was wearing a t-shirt?
- What?

140
00:13:33,874 --> 00:13:36,667
He was wearing a t-shirt
when it was stopped?

141
00:13:36,668 --> 00:13:39,003
No, I think not,
because ...

142
00:13:39,004 --> 00:13:43,090
he put his shorts on the grass, so
could see the bag out.

143
00:13:43,091 --> 00:13:50,264
It's incredible. Criminals are always
topless in this program. It's perfect.

144
00:13:50,265 --> 00:13:52,558
- His name is Mookie.
- Mookie?

145
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:55,645
It is Las Vegas. It is very good
playing basketball.

146
00:13:55,646 --> 00:13:58,189
He graduated last year
and would play seriously by UNLV.

147
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:59,273
That's good.

148
00:13:59,274 --> 00:14:01,539
Yes .. but injured his knee
and lost his place.

149
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,778
So have you been to recover
throughout the year.

150
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:07,698
But there was an opening and he will train
with them again in late summer

151
00:14:07,699 --> 00:14:09,353
and see if it is recovered.

152
00:14:09,354 --> 00:14:13,371
What else found out about it?
Have a girlfriend?

153
00:14:13,372 --> 00:14:14,222
I do not know.

154
00:14:32,432 --> 00:14:33,362
Okay?

155
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:36,809
That's him.

156
00:14:38,397 --> 00:14:42,942
It is a dream. Maybe you leave
use the jersey tops.

157
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:46,362
You can draw you a picture
and put it in your locker.

158
00:14:46,363 --> 00:14:48,990
The list of girls will invite you to
parties upset them.

159
00:14:48,991 --> 00:14:52,034
- I'm in Listing A.
- Do not pinch me.

160
00:14:52,035 --> 00:14:54,871
It is an excellent choice, but
Cherry is better.

161
00:14:54,872 --> 00:14:57,373
I think the best is cherry
the lemon. Just my opinion.

162
00:14:57,374 --> 00:14:58,234
Thanks.

163
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:06,841
Sorry, I was running ...
That's why I'm sweaty.

164
00:15:06,842 --> 00:15:10,222
- It always happens ...
- That's good.

165
00:15:11,263 --> 00:15:14,323
- See you later.
- Okay. Goodbye.

166
00:15:16,685 --> 00:15:19,425
- "This is good" ...
- Shut up!

167
00:15:21,648 --> 00:15:24,275
Already chosen your
classes?

168
00:15:24,276 --> 00:15:29,363
Almost. I'll do on Tuesdays and Thursdays:
"Religions of Asia".

169
00:15:29,364 --> 00:15:31,490
You go to a fraternity?

170
00:15:31,491 --> 00:15:33,951
Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays
I have ...

171
00:15:33,952 --> 00:15:36,037
Come on, it will be so cool.

172
00:15:36,038 --> 00:15:39,249
You can drink beer upside down
and raping girls fraternity.

173
00:15:39,286 --> 00:15:40,250
It will be fantastic, man.

174
00:15:40,292 --> 00:15:42,501
- You're jealous.
- I'm not.

175
00:15:42,502 --> 00:15:46,568
You're jealous. Because you'll
be counter to drool over in you ...

176
00:15:46,569 --> 00:15:50,337
and I'll be at UNM with
graduate students,

177
00:15:50,338 --> 00:15:52,136
to do rituals with cacti.

178
00:15:52,137 --> 00:15:54,307
Or watching Star Trek.

179
00:16:00,145 --> 00:16:02,730
Have you ever thought of
back to school?

180
00:16:02,731 --> 00:16:06,359
You do not have to read and other
things in school?

181
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:10,905
Seriously. You're smart and talented.
Why not?

182
00:16:10,906 --> 00:16:12,990
I think I decided then
to win Miss America.

183
00:16:12,991 --> 00:16:17,537
Will I get all that money
scholarship, so I will at that time.

184
00:16:17,538 --> 00:16:19,728
I was just thinking.

185
00:16:20,207 --> 00:16:22,542
You know the TV show
longer seen in Venezuela?

186
00:16:22,543 --> 00:16:23,703
No, what?

187
00:16:24,211 --> 00:16:26,546
The contest of Miss
Venezuela.

188
00:16:26,547 --> 00:16:28,589
I liked living in
Venezuela.

189
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:30,478
Why would Miss
Venezuela.

190
00:16:30,479 --> 00:16:32,552
And then everyone else
know who I was.

191
00:16:32,553 --> 00:16:35,137
You could shine in one of those novels
Spanish.

192
00:16:35,138 --> 00:16:38,280
Dating would like, with a player
Famous Brazilian soccer,

193
00:16:38,281 --> 00:16:40,142
and we would be in the newspapers
every day.

194
00:16:40,143 --> 00:16:42,520
And he had an aunt who was a "bruja"

195
00:16:42,521 --> 00:16:45,815
and we would visit her in the rain forest,

196
00:16:45,816 --> 00:16:51,766
and she would give me a herbal remedy
crazy to get me better.

197
00:16:52,197 --> 00:16:55,074
I saw her playing with fire and
held my breath

198
00:16:55,075 --> 00:16:59,245
while the firelight
dancing on your skin.

199
00:16:59,246 --> 00:17:03,756
... Like a thousand fireflies babies
born in a minute tram,

200
00:17:03,757 --> 00:17:07,277
and disappear at the end
the summer

201
00:17:12,301 --> 00:17:15,111
- She's beautiful, is not it?
- Yes.

202
00:17:16,054 --> 00:17:19,721
Yes it is. It resembles
a cheerleader the Dallas Cowboys.

203
00:17:19,722 --> 00:17:21,432
But not really.

204
00:17:25,939 --> 00:17:30,089
She likes you, you know?
You should leave.

205
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:39,243
- What is she doing?
- Read this in a music magazine.

206
00:17:39,244 --> 00:17:42,538
A kind of special treatment
for MS.

207
00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:43,373
What?

208
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:47,877
He was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis
about two years.

209
00:17:47,878 --> 00:17:50,421
And so it came here.
To calm the nerves.

210
00:17:50,422 --> 00:17:55,812
And her aunt can help her with some
health insurance.

211
00:17:57,054 --> 00:18:02,904
- What is she doing?
Bee venom helps in MS.

212
00:18:23,121 --> 00:18:25,831
- What do you like to have on your pizza?
- Anchovies.

213
00:18:25,832 --> 00:18:27,552
- Really?
- Yes.

214
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:36,467
I also like sardines, but not on pizza.
Only with a little mustard.

215
00:18:36,468 --> 00:18:42,118
I also like anchovies. I mean
we're soulmates.

216
00:18:46,561 --> 00:18:49,885
OPEN You know, I think
good chance of winning.

217
00:18:49,886 --> 00:18:55,010
Although not the most glowing, you know, or
the candidate with the best pose,

218
00:18:55,011 --> 00:18:56,551
When you reach
time for me to do

219
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:58,614
questions, will arrange
manner of speaking

220
00:18:58,615 --> 00:18:59,991
treatment of diseases

221
00:18:59,992 --> 00:19:02,660
United States and will
mention my illness.

222
00:19:02,661 --> 00:19:05,121
So smart judges
will appreciate that I have

223
00:19:05,122 --> 00:19:08,374
formed opinions and ideas personal
in current affairs

224
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:10,751
donkeys and judges will vote for me
because

225
00:19:10,752 --> 00:19:11,878
I am the girl sick,

226
00:19:11,879 --> 00:19:14,139
and how it works.

227
00:19:14,882 --> 00:19:22,094
- Does it hurt?
- Sometimes.

228
00:19:23,348 --> 00:19:28,302
Not always, but yes.
Sometimes.

229
00:19:43,493 --> 00:19:45,993
Do not forget tomorrow.

230
00:19:46,455 --> 00:19:49,045
- See you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.

231
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:11,164
Never had a
those times as good

232
00:20:11,165 --> 00:20:12,816
they think not
deserve?

233
00:20:12,817 --> 00:20:16,817
And God must be helping you because
You must be condemned, but do not want to know?

234
00:20:16,818 --> 00:20:18,688
Not so long ago.

235
00:20:18,904 --> 00:20:22,414
I just had one on the bike
Mookie's.

236
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:28,287
He is fantastic, kind, honest,
weird and all that ...

237
00:20:28,288 --> 00:20:29,928
I really like it.

238
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:34,001
By pretending that he liked
anchovies.

239
00:20:34,002 --> 00:20:35,092
What horror.

240
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:42,426
Think you can fall in love
after a meeting?

241
00:20:42,427 --> 00:20:43,437
Yes, I think.

242
00:20:43,929 --> 00:20:47,139
March 28, 1992.
Austin, Texas.

243
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:49,932
I drew Lissa Stevens
the lovely Lissa Stevens.

244
00:20:49,933 --> 00:20:52,061
In Green '68 Mustang from his mother.

245
00:20:52,062 --> 00:20:55,808
Foam-in-Mar. There was green.
A Mustang Foam-in-Mar.

246
00:20:55,809 --> 00:20:59,949
She loved that car.
It was a great car.

247
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:03,666
I took her to see an exhibition of 8:00
the Breakfast at Tiffany's

248
00:21:03,667 --> 00:21:04,824
at Paramount.

249
00:21:04,825 --> 00:21:08,289
He waited until the old Holly Golightly
go looking for her cat,

250
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:11,910
rain, until I arrived.
I gave him a hand.

251
00:21:11,911 --> 00:21:16,991
Must be the sweetest ray film
they did.

252
00:21:17,212 --> 00:21:21,048
After leaving the theater,
it was raining over-fed,

253
00:21:21,049 --> 00:21:23,459
and Lissa was to jump through puddles ...

254
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,011
She was a dancer in puddles.

255
00:21:25,012 --> 00:21:28,222
We sat in the car, we left the
our clothes to dry e. ..

256
00:21:28,223 --> 00:21:31,143
I forgot my bowl, so smoke
herb from a beer can

257
00:21:31,194 --> 00:21:33,187
she found in the back seat.

258
00:21:33,228 --> 00:21:34,478
It was perfect.

259
00:21:36,064 --> 00:21:38,734
Just enjoy e. ..
Perfect.

260
00:21:40,694 --> 00:21:43,320
We took that old long way
home and heard ...

261
00:21:43,321 --> 00:21:48,801
Some tapes and I followed it
until the bedroom door.

262
00:21:49,661 --> 00:21:54,336
And we almost kissed.
Remember this, girls.

263
00:21:54,371 --> 00:21:57,653
The only thing better than kissing
the first meeting ...

264
00:21:57,654 --> 00:22:01,344
It's almost kiss
the first meeting.

265
00:22:03,717 --> 00:22:07,970
The dating of them lasted 42 kisses,
and then fled.

266
00:22:07,971 --> 00:22:09,141
43 kisses ...

267
00:22:09,343 --> 00:22:13,684
The 43rd was a church
expedient in Roswell.

268
00:22:13,685 --> 00:22:17,775
Still savoring the kiss ...
... Number 43,

269
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:19,120
Until today.

270
00:22:23,445 --> 00:22:26,482
Okay, guys.
Do not sleep late.

271
00:22:26,483 --> 00:22:28,824
We have a barbecue for
go tomorrow.

272
00:22:28,825 --> 00:22:31,255
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

273
00:23:35,309 --> 00:23:38,119
What do you want,
meat or tofu?

274
00:23:38,852 --> 00:23:41,192
As a ray forests tofu?

275
00:23:42,608 --> 00:23:46,538
- You got me.
- Medium rare, please.

276
00:23:47,696 --> 00:23:50,615
I heard that you want to be Miss America.
Is this true?

277
00:23:50,616 --> 00:23:53,951
I pray that every night.
I pray the same.

278
00:23:53,952 --> 00:23:55,112
That's good.

279
00:23:56,096 --> 00:23:58,724
God.
I'm almost 40 and still do not know

280
00:23:58,725 --> 00:24:01,775
I want to be when
grow.

281
00:24:02,252 --> 00:24:04,979
What about a travel agent?

282
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,310
- No.
- No?

283
00:24:07,563 --> 00:24:10,623
- A princess?
- I think not.

284
00:24:12,577 --> 00:24:16,474
- A princess spy.
- That's interesting.

285
00:24:16,475 --> 00:24:17,709
I've wanted to be so,

286
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:21,103
but then decided to quit because I
longer be Miss America.

287
00:24:21,104 --> 00:24:26,776
Although spy princess type, with cameras
tiara in secret, highly.

288
00:24:26,777 --> 00:24:31,787
So what can you tell me about
my new city?

289
00:24:32,032 --> 00:24:35,252
Well, unfortunately, do not go
much.

290
00:24:35,577 --> 00:24:38,798
Never, really. I have these attacks
when I try to leave.

291
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:42,708
I could not even go to the ceremony
Graduation Audrey.

292
00:24:42,709 --> 00:24:44,339
This is unfortunate.

293
00:24:45,243 --> 00:24:49,543
So, like Herb
do things their parents?

294
00:24:49,648 --> 00:24:51,926
Yeah, like, but it is not my father.
It's my mom's boyfriend.

295
00:24:51,927 --> 00:24:54,667
- Oh ..
- But that's okay.

296
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:57,785
They are eager to
marry.

297
00:24:57,786 --> 00:25:00,724
I love it.
It's a nice guy.

298
00:25:00,725 --> 00:25:05,035
He has a cool office.
It smells like Pez.

299
00:25:05,315 --> 00:25:06,475
That's good.

300
00:25:09,773 --> 00:25:13,303
Cool, I mean.
Good office.

301
00:26:47,537 --> 00:26:52,747
Its cool place,
blue eye makeup, red bed.

302
00:26:52,748 --> 00:26:55,102
A desire to fall into the blank image

303
00:26:55,103 --> 00:26:57,833
where is always calm and summer.

304
00:26:58,219 --> 00:27:00,169
Drunk on sweet juice,

305
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:03,428
'll Walk away from this
Travel delicate

306
00:27:03,429 --> 00:27:04,989
As one woman.

307
00:27:07,442 --> 00:27:09,642
- I like it.
- Thanks.

308
00:27:12,234 --> 00:27:15,524
Lugar cool. "
That's Mookie?

309
00:27:16,955 --> 00:27:18,282
Yes

310
00:27:18,991 --> 00:27:22,031
The narrator is not the Calista, is it?

311
00:27:24,997 --> 00:27:25,831
No.

312
00:27:26,748 --> 00:27:27,998
I thought so.

313
00:27:37,176 --> 00:27:40,696
They are having sex now, not
are?

314
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:45,630
It's a beautiful thing, is not it?

315
00:28:07,289 --> 00:28:09,409
- Come on.
- We go where?

316
00:28:11,168 --> 00:28:13,118
- About.
- What?

317
00:28:13,712 --> 00:28:15,432
The electric fence.

318
00:28:15,964 --> 00:28:19,084
- What is it?
- I'll show you.

319
00:28:25,307 --> 00:28:27,391
People come here
to heal.

320
00:28:27,392 --> 00:28:28,684
What do you mean?

321
00:28:28,685 --> 00:28:31,814
People with all kinds of diseases
come here.

322
00:28:31,815 --> 00:28:34,357
- Arthritis and How so?
Yes

323
00:28:34,358 --> 00:28:36,763
And they cling to the fence
the best they can

324
00:28:36,764 --> 00:28:40,124
that the current
will cure them.

325
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:49,920
I've never been here alone.
Without Audrey, I mean.

326
00:28:50,582 --> 00:28:53,232
- Works?
- Sure.

327
00:29:37,045 --> 00:29:39,088
The June-July edition of
our magazine.

328
00:29:39,089 --> 00:29:40,428
We have here a story

329
00:29:40,429 --> 00:29:42,717
about some kids who invented
a formula to shrink,

330
00:29:42,718 --> 00:29:47,540
and then formed a utopian society
in Jerry Garcia's beard.

331
00:29:47,541 --> 00:29:48,631
Very cool.

332
00:29:50,642 --> 00:29:52,059
What are you doing?

333
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:56,040
The famous cure for
the hangover from my father.

334
00:29:57,566 --> 00:29:58,400
Is it good?

335
00:30:03,201 --> 00:30:06,031
Employees only.
Do not enter.

336
00:30:10,454 --> 00:30:14,707
- I have some vomit on my t-shirt?
- No. ..

337
00:30:14,708 --> 00:30:19,478
- What?
- Do you have no vomit on your shirt.

338
00:30:19,922 --> 00:30:23,842
Glad ...
Because it was very boring.

339
00:30:28,388 --> 00:30:33,601
Could you give me some advice? The Calista
showed me something this morning.

340
00:30:33,602 --> 00:30:36,854
Want to do something special for her.
Think you can help me?

341
00:30:36,855 --> 00:30:39,205
The pick something special?

342
00:30:39,942 --> 00:30:44,422
- Yes, I'll think of something.
- Cool, thanks.

343
00:30:48,575 --> 00:30:51,160
She really likes the sauce
BBQ in crisps.

344
00:30:51,161 --> 00:30:54,163
and do not forget Berry Blast.
It's her favorite dessert.

345
00:30:54,164 --> 00:30:57,416
That's sweet. She'll love it.
Thanks.

346
00:30:57,417 --> 00:30:59,927
- You sweetie.
- Whatever.

347
00:31:01,797 --> 00:31:05,842
You must have lots of
boys beat up on the door.

348
00:31:05,843 --> 00:31:09,063
- No, really.
- Really?

349
00:31:10,495 --> 00:31:13,558
- Really?
- I have a boy to play with.

350
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:15,829
- You really have one?
- Yes.

351
00:31:16,186 --> 00:31:18,936
- That guy?
- Yes, that.

352
00:31:20,068 --> 00:31:25,068
No, he's a sweetheart. Sometimes it is a
little bastard.

353
00:31:32,244 --> 00:31:36,038
I spoke with Calista, and she told me
all you do for her,

354
00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:40,502
as would be in bed all day
if you were not you,

355
00:31:40,503 --> 00:31:44,130
and I think it's fantastic
what to do for her.

356
00:31:44,131 --> 00:31:47,331
Well, it is my
best friend.

357
00:31:50,179 --> 00:31:54,019
What will happen when
're gone?

358
00:31:55,267 --> 00:31:56,601
I'm not going anywhere.

359
00:31:56,602 --> 00:32:01,240
I mean when you go
for university or ...

360
00:32:01,241 --> 00:32:02,940
I'm not going anywhere.

361
00:32:02,941 --> 00:32:04,775
The Calista says you're a
kind of genius.

362
00:32:04,776 --> 00:32:08,738
Well, I'm not a genius and I do not need
no diploma.

363
00:32:08,739 --> 00:32:11,574
I want to be a writer. Emily Dickinson
was one of the largest

364
00:32:11,575 --> 00:32:14,202
poets of all time and was never
the university.

365
00:32:14,203 --> 00:32:16,623
She never left the room.

366
00:32:17,082 --> 00:32:18,012
Okay.

367
00:32:19,428 --> 00:32:20,288
Sorry.

368
00:32:26,991 --> 00:32:30,704
Suspended ceiling
of nowhere and beyond

369
00:32:30,705 --> 00:32:35,776
Rego's garden dream
but wilt in the land is dry.

370
00:32:35,777 --> 00:32:41,677
Invisible, invent a fairy tale
and patch their angel wings ...

371
00:32:41,678 --> 00:32:47,238
Weaving until my fingers ache,
so she can fly.

372
00:32:49,404 --> 00:32:53,075
Hamburger, no cheese,
with extra ketchup.

373
00:32:53,076 --> 00:32:58,538
Chinese egg roll next to the
Wal-Mart as an appetizer.

374
00:32:58,539 --> 00:33:00,969
MacDonalds potatoes e. ..

375
00:33:02,567 --> 00:33:03,737
Berry Blast.

376
00:33:04,795 --> 00:33:05,725
This is ...

377
00:33:09,341 --> 00:33:15,381
And barbecue sauce. They charged more
but said it did not matter.

378
00:33:29,945 --> 00:33:34,015
- How are things?
- I do not feel very well.

379
00:33:35,325 --> 00:33:41,745
Oh, their encounter. Long time no
saw something so romantic.

380
00:33:44,376 --> 00:33:47,356
- It was the wrong answer?
- No.

381
00:33:48,729 --> 00:33:50,299
Answer honestly.

382
00:33:56,138 --> 00:33:59,978
I hope to be ready in two weeks.

383
00:34:00,272 --> 00:34:03,402
- And you, how are you?
- I'm fine.

384
00:34:04,062 --> 00:34:07,812
I have bad days, but are
most good.

385
00:34:08,525 --> 00:34:10,165
I think you brave.

386
00:34:13,789 --> 00:34:16,359
I think you pity me.

387
00:34:18,116 --> 00:34:21,886
No. .. I'm just
a little bit scared.

388
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:27,799
It's like a story that once read about
a guy to play with Larry Bird,

389
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,700
Larry Bird and blocked his finger

390
00:34:29,701 --> 00:34:32,548
and asked the boy to pull him out,

391
00:34:32,549 --> 00:34:34,810
He was afraid
do it.

392
00:34:34,811 --> 00:34:37,391
And if he did mess up?

393
00:34:38,042 --> 00:34:42,261
And if he did more damage to one of
best fingers to touch a basketball?

394
00:34:42,262 --> 00:34:48,981
I do not know how to react if hadst asked me
you to pull your finger for you.

395
00:34:48,982 --> 00:34:54,572
- Make any sense?
- Yes.

396
00:36:53,232 --> 00:36:56,484
- Hello
- Hey I did not know fumavas.

397
00:36:56,485 --> 00:37:01,245
And do not smoke. I mean,
a smoke ... or 6 per day.

398
00:37:03,951 --> 00:37:05,494
You have a good voice.

399
00:37:05,546 --> 00:37:07,871
Thank you. I'm not sure
about it ...

400
00:37:07,913 --> 00:37:11,207
Seriously. That song
sang ...

401
00:37:11,208 --> 00:37:14,482
Never heard anything
so. Not on the radio.

402
00:37:14,483 --> 00:37:16,003
Ever been in a band
or something?

403
00:37:16,004 --> 00:37:19,524
Or something?
Audrey, she did everything.

404
00:37:21,218 --> 00:37:24,828
Played bass in a real punk band

405
00:37:26,849 --> 00:37:31,561
After that, he had a lot
successes in Finland ...

406
00:37:31,562 --> 00:37:34,814
... With a band called
Horse. Already you hear?

407
00:37:34,815 --> 00:37:37,823
And then came one million
hearts

408
00:37:37,824 --> 00:37:39,657
with their songs
on guitar.

409
00:37:39,658 --> 00:37:43,239
- You sound corny, dear.
- Oh yeah?

410
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:46,012
- Millions of hearts.
- And a Million.

411
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:47,493
Do not pay any attention to him.

412
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:52,081
It's true. She was fantastic.
It was like Joan Jett.

413
00:37:52,082 --> 00:37:55,219
Well, then how is it
no longer play anymore?

414
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:58,671
Stage fright. She could only
play it was well prepared,

415
00:37:58,672 --> 00:38:01,591
Then he said that from now on only
played for me and Herb.

416
00:38:01,592 --> 00:38:04,332
- That's sad.
- Yes it is ...

417
00:38:05,053 --> 00:38:07,065
It's like a girl who writes poems
really nice guys

418
00:38:07,066 --> 00:38:09,469
but not put them in the magazine of friends.

419
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:11,707
The get a little strass?

420
00:38:11,708 --> 00:38:14,208
- I grow a goatee.
- It's nice.

421
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:18,608
Yes, I think Calista is not
very happy with it.

422
00:38:18,609 --> 00:38:21,819
- I think it looks good.
- Yes?

423
00:38:21,996 --> 00:38:25,281
Too bad not yet have connections.
But I do not care because ...

424
00:38:25,282 --> 00:38:28,252
- How about this?
- Let's see.

425
00:38:34,791 --> 00:38:39,331
Can I read some of your poems
sometime?

426
00:38:39,338 --> 00:38:43,675
Do not really like leaving the
people read them until they are ready.

427
00:38:43,676 --> 00:38:48,031
I do not understand, as you know it
are ready to read them without leave?

428
00:38:48,032 --> 00:38:54,152
I just know. You should arrange
this to Calista. It'll be a cinder ..

429
00:38:54,272 --> 00:39:00,862
By the way, Emily Dickinson was in
Mount Holyoke College one year.

430
00:39:00,996 --> 00:39:03,336
Dunno if you knew that.

431
00:39:10,777 --> 00:39:12,817
Hello, Audrey.
Mail.

432
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:24,944
- Dreamer. What will I do?
- Do not ask me. I'm just the messenger.

433
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:27,892
- Thanks.
- Okay, honey.

434
00:39:27,893 --> 00:39:28,727
Father?

435
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:32,204
Father?

436
00:39:40,422 --> 00:39:41,432
Father!
Father!

437
00:39:47,114 --> 00:39:49,492
- I ran out of cigarettes.
- Okay, okay.

438
00:39:49,493 --> 00:39:50,327
Breathe.

439
00:39:53,894 --> 00:39:54,728
Breathe.

440
00:39:58,195 --> 00:39:59,595
It's okay.

441
00:40:01,696 --> 00:40:02,530
Breathe.

442
00:40:07,509 --> 00:40:12,919
Just thought I could go
get some cigarettes to the shop.

443
00:40:13,098 --> 00:40:16,458
Take this. I'll take you
the doctor.

444
00:40:16,599 --> 00:40:18,716
There must be a pill you can take.

445
00:40:18,717 --> 00:40:20,164
No doctors, baby.

446
00:40:20,165 --> 00:40:22,276
I've seen some ads.
There is a drug that can be taken.

447
00:40:22,277 --> 00:40:23,927
Help me to just keep your head
out of water.

448
00:40:23,928 --> 00:40:25,888
- Okay?
- Sure.

449
00:40:25,964 --> 00:40:29,724
- You bring me a wet cloth?
- Okay.

450
00:40:35,412 --> 00:40:36,272
Thanks.

451
00:40:37,289 --> 00:40:39,709
You bring me another? Please.

452
00:40:43,471 --> 00:40:45,121
Thanks, dear.

453
00:41:08,807 --> 00:41:12,492
Hello, Audrey. I'll get something
to drink. You want anything?

454
00:41:12,493 --> 00:41:13,534
- Yes.
- What do you want?

455
00:41:13,581 --> 00:41:14,785
Water.

456
00:41:16,078 --> 00:41:18,219
- What is it?
- Dad.

457
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:23,160
I'm tired of always being
worried about him, you know?

458
00:41:23,377 --> 00:41:25,497
- Sorry.
- For what?

459
00:41:26,672 --> 00:41:29,257
It also will always be
worried about me.

460
00:41:29,258 --> 00:41:33,010
Calista, I love you.
I will always support you.

461
00:41:33,011 --> 00:41:34,571
I love you too.

462
00:41:35,008 --> 00:41:37,740
So tomorrow when you come with me
Hospital, is not it?

463
00:41:37,741 --> 00:41:38,575
Sure.

464
00:41:40,936 --> 00:41:41,785
What are they talking about?

465
00:41:41,786 --> 00:41:43,187
I have to go back to work.

466
00:41:43,188 --> 00:41:44,063
Are you sure?

467
00:41:44,064 --> 00:41:46,435
It is the last opportunity to test the Mookie
the knee before going to Vegas.

468
00:41:46,436 --> 00:41:48,935
- Do not think it was so early.
- Two days.

469
00:41:48,936 --> 00:41:52,462
- Do not go.
- What are you saying? You know I have to go.

470
00:41:52,463 --> 00:41:57,933
I know. Then you have to pass
me all the time until then.

471
00:42:01,655 --> 00:42:03,685
Okay.
Okay. Goodbye.

472
00:42:23,004 --> 00:42:23,838
Audrey?

473
00:42:26,713 --> 00:42:29,453
Need a ride
home.

474
00:42:37,664 --> 00:42:38,524
Audrey ...

475
00:42:41,762 --> 00:42:44,812
- There is fungus among us.
- What?

476
00:42:45,174 --> 00:42:47,284
There is fungus among us ....

477
00:42:48,850 --> 00:42:51,510
- Oh, no. No.
- Yes! Yes!

478
00:42:52,052 --> 00:42:53,893
- Abraham ...
- Audrey ...

479
00:42:53,894 --> 00:42:55,097
I know what will happen.

480
00:42:55,098 --> 00:42:58,610
I'll end up belly
down on this bed,

481
00:42:58,611 --> 00:43:02,097
sentimental things to think
and drooling

482
00:43:02,098 --> 00:43:03,607
as last time.

483
00:43:03,608 --> 00:43:07,838
"It's okay."
This time will be great.

484
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:45,130
What time is it?

485
00:43:45,183 --> 00:43:47,229
No time.
That's what I'm saying.

486
00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:50,740
You know, me and you're time.
That's it.

487
00:43:52,518 --> 00:43:53,928
Shit. Calista.

488
00:43:54,222 --> 00:43:58,423
Calista is time. All
you know ... it's time.

489
00:43:58,424 --> 00:44:01,714
Plants are time, stones are time,
animals are long.

490
00:44:01,715 --> 00:44:04,525
All we know
is time.

491
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:30,030
- Forgot.
- I know, I know. I screwed up.

492
00:44:30,763 --> 00:44:31,720
She was really scared.

493
00:44:31,721 --> 00:44:35,628
He had terrible spasms and repaired
you were not,

494
00:44:35,629 --> 00:44:38,219
It took a ...
... It got worse.

495
00:44:39,342 --> 00:44:43,422
I had no intention.
Just ... I lost myself.

496
00:44:45,666 --> 00:44:51,456
The Mookie is gone.
He's too good to Dreamland.

497
00:44:52,529 --> 00:44:56,129
Go to a site
far, far away.

498
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:02,198
I do not know, I just ...
I feel everything to prove, you know?

499
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:04,069
I know how you feel.

500
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:07,774
I do not.

501
00:45:09,699 --> 00:45:13,644
You and Calista have always been uncomplicated.

502
00:45:13,645 --> 00:45:15,645
I'm a complicated, you know?

503
00:45:15,646 --> 00:45:17,056
You complicate.

504
00:45:20,106 --> 00:45:27,496
Just do not want to face it.
Do not want to face it so ...

505
00:45:27,531 --> 00:45:30,624
- Seamless?
- Yes.

506
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:36,191
What should I do?

507
00:45:38,326 --> 00:45:41,068
Honey ...
You're asking advice from a guy

508
00:45:41,069 --> 00:45:45,519
that does not leave a park
caravans for 2 years.

509
00:45:46,025 --> 00:45:48,595
I'm not good at helping.

510
00:45:56,011 --> 00:45:59,171
- Will you miss me?
- Sure I will.

511
00:45:59,172 --> 00:46:00,279
Much?

512
00:46:04,068 --> 00:46:05,175
It.

513
00:46:05,617 --> 00:46:09,328
No, you will not.
You'll even forget me.

514
00:46:09,329 --> 00:46:11,349
What are you saying?

515
00:46:11,748 --> 00:46:14,728
A week away from Dreamland ...

516
00:46:14,825 --> 00:46:20,362
You'll find a fan of basketball and
Forgot your girlfriend sick.

517
00:46:20,363 --> 00:46:23,243
I will not forget you.

518
00:46:28,557 --> 00:46:31,685
- Sorry.
- Do not ask.

519
00:46:33,430 --> 00:46:34,154
How did it go?

520
00:46:34,155 --> 00:46:38,305
Well, I still can not connect to
all those medical equipment.

521
00:46:38,306 --> 00:46:43,154
So I do not know,
but he had a beautiful smile ...

522
00:46:43,155 --> 00:46:46,765
Not very comforting or so,
I think it was so good, right?

523
00:46:46,766 --> 00:46:48,367
I was selfish, sorry.

524
00:46:48,368 --> 00:46:50,505
I said do not ask, okay?

525
00:46:50,506 --> 00:46:52,275
Thank you Mookie, for having appeared.

526
00:46:52,276 --> 00:46:55,956
Come on, Mookie.
We only have one more night.

527
00:47:50,597 --> 00:47:52,317
I like this site.

528
00:47:52,683 --> 00:47:56,993
- How do you find?
- A really good place.

529
00:47:58,438 --> 00:48:02,818
- Have you been spying on me?
- Maybe.

530
00:48:03,744 --> 00:48:06,182
From a metaphysical form, perhaps.

531
00:48:06,183 --> 00:48:10,653
I think it's impossible to keep
secrets here.

532
00:48:14,593 --> 00:48:18,469
It's cool, right?
- The Herb helped me build it.

533
00:48:18,470 --> 00:48:21,600
- The Herb is fantastic.
- Yes it is.

534
00:48:22,823 --> 00:48:25,808
It will be my official father.
And this?

535
00:48:25,809 --> 00:48:27,652
He and my mother will marry
tomorrow night.

536
00:48:27,653 --> 00:48:30,280
Today, I think.
When we go to Vegas.

537
00:48:30,281 --> 00:48:31,131
Really?

538
00:48:33,708 --> 00:48:37,344
Come stay in one place
called "Motel in America."

539
00:48:37,345 --> 00:48:40,869
Because it was there that my mother wrote
Herb's favorite song.

540
00:48:40,870 --> 00:48:42,030
It's crazy.

541
00:48:42,031 --> 00:48:48,601
It's all happening at once.
It's all to compose himself.

542
00:48:54,330 --> 00:48:56,287
What are you doing here?

543
00:48:56,288 --> 00:49:00,208
I like to walk when not
sleep.

544
00:49:00,224 --> 00:49:02,920
I found this place
at random.

545
00:49:02,921 --> 00:49:09,343
- Why can not you sleep?
- Ando ... confusing.

546
00:49:11,954 --> 00:49:15,254
- Do you come here for writing?
- No.

547
00:49:18,435 --> 00:49:19,352
It sucks.

548
00:49:19,353 --> 00:49:22,573
It was fantastic.
Want to read more.

549
00:49:22,656 --> 00:49:26,609
It's just a few lines on a sad
and misunderstood girl and ends.

550
00:49:26,610 --> 00:49:30,910
Let me read. I want to read
everything you write.

551
00:49:48,475 --> 00:49:51,055
Shit. Do not know where
am.

552
00:50:32,417 --> 00:50:34,941
Calis Honey, do not want
wake up. You were so beautiful.

553
00:50:34,942 --> 00:50:40,742
I will miss you. I see you
when you return to Dreamland.

554
00:51:10,223 --> 00:51:11,057
Audrey?

555
00:51:13,705 --> 00:51:16,195
What are you doing here?

556
00:51:16,904 --> 00:51:17,738
Nothing.

557
00:51:19,001 --> 00:51:22,673
This is where the evening comes Mookie
once in a while.

558
00:51:22,674 --> 00:51:25,644
- He's gone.
- I know.

559
00:51:28,176 --> 00:51:32,861
- He was here?
- Yes.

560
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:39,750
- What is it?
- I'm in love with him.

561
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:47,960
He is in love with you?
She loves you?

562
00:51:50,472 --> 00:51:51,322
I do not know.

563
00:51:56,033 --> 00:51:59,403
I hope so.
Calista, listen to me ...

564
00:52:00,929 --> 00:52:04,919
I do not know anything about anything, okay?
Just want ...

565
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:10,538
I heard those stories
my father about my mother e. ..

566
00:52:10,539 --> 00:52:11,779
and read books.

567
00:52:13,151 --> 00:52:16,300
I. .. I truly believe in love.

568
00:52:16,301 --> 00:52:20,178
And for too fleeting or tragic it may be,
I still believe in him.

569
00:52:21,910 --> 00:52:25,430
I am 18 years ...
I only want to surrender.

570
00:52:26,456 --> 00:52:34,216
You know what, fuck your anguish
teenager, because I'm dying.

571
00:52:58,188 --> 00:53:00,388
Happy birthday, Lisa.

572
00:54:10,978 --> 00:54:13,098
Happy Birthday, Mom

573
00:54:36,753 --> 00:54:41,591
The Calista went away.
I think I took my bike.

574
00:54:41,592 --> 00:54:42,602
Las Vegas!

575
00:54:46,136 --> 00:54:49,891
You should have me counting.
Had arranged more grass and stuff.

576
00:54:49,892 --> 00:54:53,402
Is not that kind of trip,
is serious.

577
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:56,856
Things have become very serious.

578
00:54:56,857 --> 00:54:59,037
What does that mean?

579
00:55:00,602 --> 00:55:06,632
When you return, you must stop
give me a ride home.

580
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:08,994
What?

581
00:55:12,498 --> 00:55:18,318
We always said we would stop
if we found someone seriously.

582
00:55:22,382 --> 00:55:23,702
Out of the car.

583
00:55:28,611 --> 00:55:29,445
Abraham.

584
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:36,312
Things are very
complicated now.

585
00:55:36,313 --> 00:55:39,558
And I need somebody
help overcome this.

586
00:55:39,559 --> 00:55:40,393
I?

587
00:55:44,194 --> 00:55:46,454
My mother is dead,

588
00:55:46,588 --> 00:55:47,597
my father is drunk

589
00:55:47,598 --> 00:55:51,908
and my best friend abandons me,
so ...

590
00:55:52,621 --> 00:55:53,941
Out of the car.

591
00:55:56,458 --> 00:56:00,546
- Get outta the car!
- Sorry.

592
00:56:00,598 --> 00:56:01,552
Just leave.

593
00:56:10,764 --> 00:56:11,624
Sorry.

594
00:58:25,107 --> 00:58:26,316
Audrey.

595
00:58:26,323 --> 00:58:30,279
Sorry, I should have phoned
but I fell asleep and had no spare change ...

596
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:33,948
Not that you found
a cab here or something.

597
00:58:33,949 --> 00:58:39,259
- What are you doing here?
- It's your engagement ring?

598
00:58:40,122 --> 00:58:46,211
- Yes.
- Fantastic. Congratulations.

599
00:58:47,421 --> 00:58:51,841
It's your wedding night. I am
interrupt. Sorry.

600
00:58:51,842 --> 00:58:53,259
Mookie was looking for.

601
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:57,014
- He came back.
- He returned to where?

602
00:58:58,348 --> 00:59:00,768
To be with Calista.

603
00:59:03,397 --> 00:59:07,441
Do not know ...
There was an accident.

604
00:59:08,150 --> 00:59:13,681
The Calista was it. You stay tonight
laps with us and tomorrow.

605
00:59:13,682 --> 00:59:15,082
It's okay.

606
00:59:31,256 --> 00:59:35,093
How is she? What they say?
It'll be good?

607
00:59:35,094 --> 00:59:40,246
I do not know. She was very hurt. Will be
here at least 2 weeks.

608
00:59:40,247 --> 00:59:44,471
Are still doing tests
the neck and it's filled with pain.

609
00:59:44,472 --> 00:59:45,306
Damn ...

610
00:59:46,188 --> 00:59:49,690
Henry, Audrey has to come here.
Have not yet encountered?

611
00:59:49,691 --> 00:59:52,068
It only comes back tomorrow night.

612
00:59:52,069 --> 00:59:54,952
Can you come here then?
I have to go back to the factory.

613
00:59:54,953 --> 00:59:56,781
I can not leave alone.

614
00:59:56,782 --> 00:59:59,992
- Please, Henry.
- No, I can not.

615
00:59:59,993 --> 01:00:03,763
- Why not?
- By ... just can not.

616
01:00:04,039 --> 01:00:06,165
There's nobody else who
can connect.

617
01:00:06,166 --> 01:00:09,856
- Sorry.
- The Calista needs you ...

618
01:01:01,039 --> 01:01:04,793
Congratulations. I am pleased to inform
that his application was accepted.

619
01:01:48,727 --> 01:01:50,927
- Henry?
- Hello dear.

620
01:01:51,063 --> 01:01:52,153
How are you?

621
01:01:54,138 --> 01:01:57,588
I'm so happy
you're here.

622
01:02:06,119 --> 01:02:13,460
- Anita left Mauritius.
- That's bad.

623
01:02:13,919 --> 01:02:15,159
No. It's good.

624
01:02:17,256 --> 01:02:22,718
Because she did it for him. She
know he loves the Rose.

625
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:28,909
It was sad because she loved him so much,
but it was beautiful, too.

626
01:02:31,061 --> 01:02:34,421
What can I do for you
dear?

627
01:02:36,664 --> 01:02:38,534
Give me the pill.

628
01:02:42,698 --> 01:02:44,798
... This is a good thing.

629
01:02:47,536 --> 01:02:50,080
Opens ... Slowly.

630
01:02:52,499 --> 01:02:57,519
Okay, just ... Do not move.
Shit, my fault.

631
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:01,591
Ready. It is well.

632
01:03:01,592 --> 01:03:09,122
Looks like it will be like from now on.
Sad people to clean up drool from my chin.

633
01:03:10,017 --> 01:03:14,855
You'll be fine.
You'll recover.

634
01:03:15,564 --> 01:03:20,414
Not you. Did you miss your love
and never recovered.

635
01:03:21,737 --> 01:03:25,574
- Honey, this is different.
- I know.

636
01:03:27,075 --> 01:03:32,497
Your death, my only
stopped loving me.

637
01:04:56,665 --> 01:05:00,475
I was behind you.
It was what I'd do.

638
01:05:02,462 --> 01:05:06,216
- I know.
- I was going to seduce you.

639
01:05:06,973 --> 01:05:11,353
Choramingona going to be sexy
and would seduce you.

640
01:05:13,390 --> 01:05:17,560
Maybe you let me get pregnant
and I would not care.

641
01:05:17,561 --> 01:05:22,440
Even if you stay with it ineligible
Miss America.

642
01:05:22,441 --> 01:05:27,529
Do not want to lie.
I do not know what is happening.

643
01:05:30,657 --> 01:05:34,535
It's as if the ball a
move fast, you know ...

644
01:05:34,536 --> 01:05:38,289
... And all I have to do is
jump and mark ...

645
01:05:38,290 --> 01:05:43,460
Mookie, I'm a bit stoned
this time to talk basketball.

646
01:05:43,837 --> 01:05:49,176
- You can just stay here?
- Yes.

647
01:06:21,475 --> 01:06:24,215
- How is she?
- Okay.

648
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:28,930
- It should be fine.
- I can see it?

649
01:06:29,174 --> 01:06:32,524
She says she does not want you now see.

650
01:06:36,682 --> 01:06:42,563
- She was alone at night?
- No, Henry was here.

651
01:06:42,688 --> 01:06:44,868
My father was here?

652
01:06:53,323 --> 01:06:55,843
What the hell are you doing?
What is this?

653
01:06:55,844 --> 01:06:59,996
- Why do not you say, dear?
- What kind of question is that?

654
01:06:59,997 --> 01:07:02,123
These large say entered.
You know that?

655
01:07:02,124 --> 01:07:03,914
Yes, I know.

656
01:07:04,585 --> 01:07:08,004
- Let's talk about this.
- You had no right to do that.

657
01:07:08,005 --> 01:07:09,922
You're right, I admit,
but now I know.

658
01:07:09,923 --> 01:07:11,953
Another smokes and forgets.

659
01:07:12,044 --> 01:07:15,052
- Well, honey ...
- Do not want to hear it now.

660
01:07:15,053 --> 01:07:17,508
But you'll hear it. I'm proud of you.

661
01:07:17,509 --> 01:07:19,648
Want to help you in what you have
to do.

662
01:07:19,649 --> 01:07:22,309
I want you to leave me alone.

663
01:07:23,145 --> 01:07:26,063
What?
Let's hear it, Dad.

664
01:07:26,064 --> 01:07:29,525
Let's hear the speech "I am your father"
What you are preparing for 3 years.

665
01:07:29,526 --> 01:07:31,736
How can I do this
right now?

666
01:07:31,737 --> 01:07:34,906
I'm trying to help you discover
what do you do.

667
01:07:34,907 --> 01:07:37,921
Perhaps what we want is to stay
forever in Dreamland

668
01:07:37,922 --> 01:07:41,802
to deal with hangovers and get your
cigarettes at convenience store.

669
01:07:41,803 --> 01:07:45,041
Perhaps you want to drink this beer and stay
there. Maybe that's what I want.

670
01:07:45,042 --> 01:07:48,572
You deserve much more than that,
dear.

671
01:07:48,712 --> 01:07:54,662
Maybe I should have had a
motorcycle accident long ago.

672
01:08:52,901 --> 01:08:53,911
Are you okay?

673
01:09:01,410 --> 01:09:02,827
What's up?

674
01:09:02,828 --> 01:09:06,539
I could not sleep, so
I was watching "Baywatch" ...

675
01:09:06,540 --> 01:09:08,291
Two kids were
drowning.

676
01:09:08,292 --> 01:09:12,086
And David Hasselhoff could only
save one.

677
01:09:12,087 --> 01:09:16,866
So he had to go tell
the father that his son was dead.

678
01:09:16,867 --> 01:09:18,897
Then I do not know.

679
01:09:19,970 --> 01:09:26,460
The impact of the emotional scene in which
David is trying to save him ..

680
01:09:28,249 --> 01:09:31,299
I do not know ...
Puts me very sad.

681
01:09:32,357 --> 01:09:34,857
I must be going mad.

682
01:09:35,736 --> 01:09:39,655
There's a difference between
be getting and being.

683
01:09:39,656 --> 01:09:43,966
- What does that mean?
- I do not know. Invented.

684
01:09:45,829 --> 01:09:47,872
Thanks for passing the night
me.

685
01:09:47,873 --> 01:09:50,853
It helped me to improve.
Thank you.

686
01:09:55,047 --> 01:09:59,027
I know that Audrey wants
come visit you.

687
01:10:00,177 --> 01:10:03,307
Maybe later but not
now.

688
01:10:13,398 --> 01:10:19,029
- How does it feel? Does it hurt?
- No. You know very well.

689
01:10:20,030 --> 01:10:22,930
We need to talk
about us.

690
01:10:25,869 --> 01:10:30,019
I wanted you to know
I like you very much.

691
01:10:30,241 --> 01:10:33,167
And I think you're a person
fantastic.

692
01:10:33,168 --> 01:10:34,488
You also are.

693
01:10:36,421 --> 01:10:40,175
And I will always love you.

694
01:10:41,325 --> 01:10:45,225
But you you're leaving, so I ...

695
01:10:48,641 --> 01:10:50,281
Just do not know ...

696
01:10:51,107 --> 01:10:55,507
- I think we should just be friends.
- Yes ..

697
01:10:57,100 --> 01:11:01,640
No, please do not stop.
Please do not stop.

698
01:11:02,827 --> 01:11:04,307
You know as well ...

699
01:11:21,049 --> 01:11:22,689
Good morning, darling.

700
01:11:30,256 --> 01:11:31,336
What?

701
01:11:31,787 --> 01:11:34,527
You ...
You look good.

702
01:11:34,730 --> 01:11:37,230
Thanks. I feel good.

703
01:11:37,974 --> 01:11:40,314
No headaches e. ..

704
01:11:43,157 --> 01:11:47,408
I realized how Shelly
is important to me.

705
01:11:47,409 --> 01:11:50,620
The kind of thing that I left
repair.

706
01:11:50,621 --> 01:11:51,455
And you?

707
01:11:53,214 --> 01:11:54,764
Only want to see.

708
01:11:55,643 --> 01:11:57,203
Is improving.

709
01:11:57,503 --> 01:11:58,903
There is not.

710
01:11:59,379 --> 01:12:03,007
Will recover from this, but never
'll be fine.

711
01:12:03,008 --> 01:12:07,470
Neurons it will continue to be
attacked and will eventually run down,

712
01:12:07,471 --> 01:12:13,491
And it will get weak and tired ...
That's how things are.

713
01:12:14,656 --> 01:12:16,056
You never know.

714
01:12:32,143 --> 01:12:32,977
You?

715
01:12:33,956 --> 01:12:34,790
Hello

716
01:12:35,624 --> 01:12:36,458
Calista?

717
01:12:37,540 --> 01:12:42,940
Hello I was wondering what you will do
after tomorrow.

718
01:12:43,571 --> 01:12:46,468
I do not know.
Why?

719
01:12:47,890 --> 01:12:49,920
I'm going home.

720
01:12:49,972 --> 01:12:52,224
This is fantastic.

721
01:12:53,182 --> 01:13:00,064
If you do not have anything to do ...
You could be there when I returned.

722
01:13:00,315 --> 01:13:04,570
Sure.
I missed you.

723
01:13:06,929 --> 01:13:09,903
- See you in the two days, okay?
- Okay.

724
01:13:09,904 --> 01:13:14,464
- Splendid. Good night, babe crazy.
- Good evening.

725
01:13:43,483 --> 01:13:45,903
- Hello
- Hello

726
01:13:46,472 --> 01:13:49,530
- The Dreamer said he'd be here.
- I've walked away.

727
01:13:49,531 --> 01:13:51,801
Anda. I keep you company.

728
01:13:52,618 --> 01:13:56,746
The Calista phoned you?
She said she would return.

729
01:13:56,747 --> 01:14:00,333
Yes, I spoke to her yesterday,
said he came home.

730
01:14:00,334 --> 01:14:03,503
Yes ..
I told you it just me?

731
01:14:03,504 --> 01:14:04,914
Just you?

732
01:14:06,848 --> 01:14:07,682
Yes ..

733
01:14:07,883 --> 01:14:11,928
But that's okay. We both knew
that would not work.

734
01:14:11,929 --> 01:14:15,069
- Why not?
- You know why not.

735
01:14:18,060 --> 01:14:21,340
I can not stop thinking about you.

736
01:14:22,022 --> 01:14:23,634
The Calista is my best friend.

737
01:14:23,635 --> 01:14:26,964
I know. This is not about Calista.
It's about you.

738
01:14:26,965 --> 01:14:29,465
Why are you doing this?

739
01:14:29,822 --> 01:14:33,282
Because I could not go away
without saying what he felt.

740
01:14:33,283 --> 01:14:36,953
It does not matter anyway,
why are you leaving and I am.

741
01:14:36,954 --> 01:14:39,789
You can not stay here forever
taking care of others.

742
01:14:39,790 --> 01:14:43,084
So what do you do?
To abandon them?

743
01:14:43,085 --> 01:14:46,045
Why? To sit
in a classroom talking about poems?

744
01:14:46,046 --> 01:14:47,797
They need me.

745
01:14:47,798 --> 01:14:49,632
Love you more than
need you.

746
01:14:49,633 --> 01:14:54,013
- You know nothing.
- I know you are more than that.

747
01:15:27,796 --> 01:15:31,236
Audrey, let me take
care of you.

748
01:16:24,811 --> 01:16:26,729
I'm so proud of you,
dear.

749
01:16:26,730 --> 01:16:28,731
I am also proud of you.

750
01:16:28,732 --> 01:16:30,132
Tell me everything.

751
01:16:31,276 --> 01:16:35,988
I will be public relations
section of product distribution.

752
01:16:35,989 --> 01:16:37,657
And they gave me a car
company.

753
01:16:37,658 --> 01:16:38,492
Good

754
01:16:40,536 --> 01:16:43,162
You'll continue to improve.
You know that?

755
01:16:43,163 --> 01:16:45,581
You'll be Miss America someday.

756
01:16:45,582 --> 01:16:47,062
You know, I do not know.

757
01:16:49,535 --> 01:16:53,266
Do not know if I want to be
Miss America.

758
01:16:53,267 --> 01:16:55,457
How about Miss Dreamland?

759
01:16:57,148 --> 01:16:58,778
Even that sounds good.

760
01:18:07,164 --> 01:18:11,845
That first night, when
I was in hospital ...

761
01:18:11,846 --> 01:18:16,464
I had a moment ...
And I got up in the middle of the night.

762
01:18:16,465 --> 01:18:23,388
The Mookie was there to sleep.
And do not believe it at first.

763
01:18:23,430 --> 01:18:28,435
When I looked it was
so cute and lovely ...

764
01:18:30,427 --> 01:18:32,457
... Something like an angel.

765
01:18:32,523 --> 01:18:36,277
- And when I heard.
- What?

766
01:18:38,070 --> 01:18:42,690
It was over, not everything, but
between us.

767
01:18:47,028 --> 01:18:53,828
I did not want there to dream
about me ...

768
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:57,839
It's weird, is not it?

769
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:00,592
Because people always wanted
dreaming about me.

770
01:19:00,634 --> 01:19:02,094
Sure.

771
01:19:02,469 --> 01:19:05,483
I tried to close my eyes
and make it go away ...

772
01:19:05,484 --> 01:19:07,949
... like that feeling but
I could not.

773
01:19:07,950 --> 01:19:09,642
Became increasingly larger.

774
01:19:09,643 --> 01:19:13,396
And all other feelings,
like love ...

775
01:19:13,397 --> 01:19:16,857
... It was as if they had
disappeared.

776
01:19:17,641 --> 01:19:20,131
And he was no longer afraid.

777
01:19:22,179 --> 01:19:24,519
You know what I mean?

778
01:19:28,078 --> 01:19:34,793
I do not know.
But I know you're beautiful ...

779
01:19:37,379 --> 01:19:43,399
And I'll never know more
no one like you a lifetime.

780
01:19:46,430 --> 01:19:52,144
- I have candy. Do you?
- Sure.

781
01:19:58,075 --> 01:20:00,235
Choose. He did not.

782
01:20:17,623 --> 01:20:18,713
I love this.

783
01:20:20,069 --> 01:20:23,119
Notice the expression on her face.

784
01:20:24,843 --> 01:20:26,323
She is adorable.

785
01:20:28,931 --> 01:20:31,155
Yes, she was always lovely, but ...

786
01:20:31,156 --> 01:20:35,466
Here it seemed he would conquer
the world, is not it?

787
01:20:42,569 --> 01:20:44,689
You made a decision?

788
01:20:48,367 --> 01:20:54,039
Yes I'm gone.

789
01:22:21,084 --> 01:22:24,587
- Very good. All ready to go.
- Thanks.

790
01:22:24,588 --> 01:22:30,618
- All loaded. I'll miss you.
- I'll also feel your.

791
01:23:17,975 --> 01:23:19,977
- Really?
- Yes.

792
01:23:25,450 --> 01:23:29,385
The blanket of smoke and sweet
crumpled on the bed.

793
01:23:29,386 --> 01:23:32,448
Drenched in perfume,
revealed by desire ...

794
01:23:32,449 --> 01:23:35,729
but strong as a spider's web.

795
01:23:35,763 --> 01:23:38,273
It will stretch while falling.

796
01:23:38,311 --> 01:23:41,085
Brush the diamonds in my eyes
and wakes.
