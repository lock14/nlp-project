2
00:00:46,524 --> 00:00:49,891
Looks like a doll's house.

3
00:00:49,994 --> 00:00:51,757
It is a bit like a doll's house.

4
00:00:55,233 --> 00:00:57,133
This is loose,
so you can get underneath this.

5
00:00:57,235 --> 00:00:59,533
- This is 5'9".
- Why?

6
00:00:59,637 --> 00:01:03,073
So the back-line guys can get in
and out of there.

7
00:01:03,174 --> 00:01:05,438
Look at those balconies.

8
00:01:05,543 --> 00:01:08,774
It might be nice to get them
out there, from... One wide.

9
00:01:10,148 --> 00:01:12,207
You know what I mean, Bob?
Hand-held.

10
00:01:13,051 --> 00:01:14,518
Well, that we can do.

11
00:01:15,553 --> 00:01:16,645
I don't know.

12
00:01:16,755 --> 00:01:21,158
I have no idea why
the stage is designed in this way.

13
00:01:21,259 --> 00:01:23,727
If there's any really rhyme
or reason to it.

14
00:01:23,828 --> 00:01:26,092
- Which part?
- All of it.

15
00:01:26,197 --> 00:01:28,825
- You wanted it.
- I never asked for those.

16
00:01:28,933 --> 00:01:30,491
That's Marty that wanted all of those.

17
00:01:31,736 --> 00:01:34,136
I thought he wanted those.

18
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:36,799
So we got them now.
I hope he likes them.

19
00:01:43,882 --> 00:01:46,077
I don't know what's going on.

20
00:01:46,985 --> 00:01:51,820
I did a hundred things over there,
but nothing that I needed to do.

21
00:01:51,923 --> 00:01:53,550
<i>I still got no answers.</i>

22
00:01:53,658 --> 00:01:55,091
<i>They're all over the place.</i>

23
00:01:55,827 --> 00:01:58,489
That's the set.

24
00:01:58,596 --> 00:01:59,824
What are these?

25
00:01:59,931 --> 00:02:01,125
The camera's arm.

26
00:02:03,134 --> 00:02:05,364
They could come
the next week together.

27
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:07,370
No, the set's gotta be built now.

28
00:02:08,606 --> 00:02:09,698
They're building it.

29
00:02:09,808 --> 00:02:11,742
<i>If worse comes to worst, we change it.</i>

30
00:02:11,843 --> 00:02:14,243
<i>We break it up and we cut it.
We saw it in half.</i>

31
00:02:14,345 --> 00:02:17,246
<i>We can glue it to different pieces...</i>

32
00:02:17,649 --> 00:02:19,810
Until they're all in the same place,

33
00:02:19,918 --> 00:02:21,476
we're not gonna
ever get a final decision.

34
00:02:31,763 --> 00:02:33,162
Do it again.

35
00:03:07,432 --> 00:03:10,265
<i>My other worry about the cameras was,</i>

36
00:03:10,368 --> 00:03:12,598
<i>Marty, that they whiz around
all the time.</i>

37
00:03:12,704 --> 00:03:14,569
<i>That's very annoying to the audience</i>

38
00:03:14,672 --> 00:03:16,071
<i>and to everyone on the stage.</i>

39
00:03:16,174 --> 00:03:17,402
<i>And it's dangerous.</i>

40
00:03:17,842 --> 00:03:20,003
It would be good
to have a camera that moves,

41
00:03:20,178 --> 00:03:22,703
that swoops down, and in and out.

42
00:03:22,814 --> 00:03:25,214
And tracks us, you know,
along the side somehow.

43
00:03:27,085 --> 00:03:28,780
<i>Is that it?</i>

44
00:03:28,887 --> 00:03:30,218
I think so.

45
00:03:31,689 --> 00:03:33,623
<i>Okey-doke, you guys. Nice to chat.</i>

46
00:03:41,499 --> 00:03:45,663
These are the songs that I've prepared,
that he said he really wanted to do.

47
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:48,238
These are the songs
that are really strong possibilities

48
00:03:48,339 --> 00:03:51,604
and these are the ones
that they're going to rehearse.

49
00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:54,269
But we got six days to go,
and he still hasn't given me an idea

50
00:03:54,379 --> 00:03:57,075
of what the set list was gonna be.

51
00:03:57,181 --> 00:03:58,239
<i>Loving Cup we already did.</i>

52
00:03:58,349 --> 00:04:00,214
<i>Shine A Light, Some Girls,
As Tears Go By.</i>

53
00:04:07,592 --> 00:04:10,356
<i>Too Much Blood, he wants to do.
She Was Hot.</i>

54
00:04:14,432 --> 00:04:17,595
This is my setlist
for Austin and the Beacon.

55
00:04:19,737 --> 00:04:22,228
It's been a bit of work, you know.

56
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,865
<i>First Time I Met the Blues, possibly.</i>

57
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:31,374
Getting a good mixture,
and then things that everyone likes,

58
00:04:31,482 --> 00:04:35,919
and things that are not so well-known,

59
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:40,286
and things that kind of work
for a theater and things that don't.

60
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,590
Try and avoid those.

61
00:04:44,796 --> 00:04:48,254
<i>Factory GirI, he wants to do.
I'm Free, he wants to do.</i>

62
00:04:53,037 --> 00:04:56,598
Categorizations and obsessions.

63
00:04:58,509 --> 00:05:00,204
All be done, Marty.

64
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:04,473
On the night, you know,
an hour before the show.

65
00:05:18,262 --> 00:05:19,661
That cleared my sinuses.

66
00:05:25,837 --> 00:05:29,830
After you guys rehearse,
I'll do something with Bob.

67
00:05:29,941 --> 00:05:31,636
You start creeping in.

68
00:05:31,743 --> 00:05:34,803
We'll just warm up and get the feel
of the room and the setup.

69
00:05:48,259 --> 00:05:50,352
<i>So if you want to have
a specific conversation with Marty</i>

70
00:05:50,461 --> 00:05:53,157
<i>about a shot when he says "move"
in a particular song,</i>

71
00:05:53,264 --> 00:05:57,166
because he is extremely precise.

72
00:06:02,774 --> 00:06:04,969
Pat should have a wide
of the whole place, if he can.

73
00:06:05,076 --> 00:06:06,338
Even with the cranes in it.

74
00:06:06,444 --> 00:06:09,413
<i>Pat Capone, you should be wide
of the whole place.</i>

75
00:06:12,283 --> 00:06:16,117
Can we know, if at all possible,
what they're gonna play?

76
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:18,745
And if... It doesn't have to be in order.

77
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:27,689
If we know,
and it would be nice to know...

78
00:06:31,102 --> 00:06:36,301
If Mick stands in front of the light
for more than 18 seconds, he'll burn.

79
00:06:36,407 --> 00:06:39,570
- What do you mean "burn"?
- He'll burn up. He'll get too hot.

80
00:06:39,677 --> 00:06:41,338
You mean, like flames?

81
00:06:41,446 --> 00:06:44,244
- He might catch on fire.
- We can't do that.

82
00:06:44,348 --> 00:06:47,476
We cannot burn Mick Jagger.
Very simple.

83
00:06:47,585 --> 00:06:49,109
We want the effect,
but we can't burn him.

84
00:06:51,622 --> 00:06:54,558
- What is that for?
- We're gonna do some lighting tests.

85
00:06:54,659 --> 00:06:57,355
That's normal movie stuff, is it?

86
00:06:57,462 --> 00:06:59,953
What do you think?

87
00:07:00,064 --> 00:07:03,397
I love movies... Looking at them.

88
00:07:06,537 --> 00:07:07,561
That's the best one.

89
00:07:07,672 --> 00:07:10,232
I've got to show you one other thing.

90
00:07:11,309 --> 00:07:13,869
If you can get a camera in here.

91
00:07:13,978 --> 00:07:17,470
Where is Charlie Watts?
Or somebody else has got to kick.

92
00:07:17,582 --> 00:07:19,072
This is my only view.

93
00:07:23,554 --> 00:07:26,148
Nobody else sees this shit except me.

94
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:34,298
It'll be good here
when we get people in here,

95
00:07:34,398 --> 00:07:36,628
when we get the live crowd.

96
00:07:36,734 --> 00:07:39,760
And the set list. I can't wait to see
what we finally end up with.

97
00:07:45,143 --> 00:07:47,008
What's the matter, Joe?

98
00:07:47,745 --> 00:07:49,406
We got a lot to do.

99
00:07:49,514 --> 00:07:52,347
Communication,
that's what I'm onto now, Bob.

100
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:54,008
Communication systems.

101
00:07:54,285 --> 00:07:56,879
<i>Give me champagne when I'm thirsty</i>

102
00:07:56,988 --> 00:07:59,650
<i>Give me a reefer
when I want to get high</i>

103
00:07:59,991 --> 00:08:01,015
Then we go into...

104
00:08:07,031 --> 00:08:09,158
Whatever the set list is gonna be,

105
00:08:09,267 --> 00:08:12,634
the first two
are going to be really strong.

106
00:08:12,737 --> 00:08:15,729
Okay, then the problem with...

107
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,707
I really would like to know
what the first song's gonna be.

108
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:24,373
Because if the first song opens
on a guitar riff, a guitar intro,

109
00:08:24,482 --> 00:08:27,349
we have to make sure
that we're covered which guitar.

110
00:08:27,451 --> 00:08:29,715
It usually is Keith.
We have to know that.

111
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:35,185
Or if the keyboard begins
and then Mick starts singing,

112
00:08:35,293 --> 00:08:38,922
the cameras have to be on Mick.
I'm just asking, find out what it is.

113
00:08:42,233 --> 00:08:44,793
<i>- Clinton will be here.
- What is it? A benefit concert?</i>

114
00:08:44,902 --> 00:08:46,597
<i>For his foundation?</i>

115
00:08:48,472 --> 00:08:49,803
Thank you.

116
00:08:52,844 --> 00:08:54,675
It's great to see you.

117
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:58,339
My nephew's coming. He's 10 or 11.

118
00:08:58,449 --> 00:09:03,011
And I've got some friends coming
with all their kids.

119
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,179
And they're really excited.

120
00:09:05,289 --> 00:09:09,726
I had all these people in their '60s,
calling and begging me for tickets.

121
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:14,990
So how's the audience gonna be
with all these cameras?

122
00:09:15,099 --> 00:09:17,897
Your guys are gonna be
in this first balcony.

123
00:09:25,877 --> 00:09:29,404
This is President Kwasniewski.
He just left being President of Poland.

124
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:32,481
This is rock and roll, okay?

125
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:34,915
Don't be nervous about anything.

126
00:09:36,854 --> 00:09:41,223
So, their guests aren't scheduled
to be here until around 6:00 or 6:05.

127
00:09:41,325 --> 00:09:42,485
Whose guests?

128
00:09:42,593 --> 00:09:44,185
The meet and greet guests.
Mr. Clinton's.

129
00:09:44,295 --> 00:09:49,028
- We just did it.
- You met and greeted the President.

130
00:09:49,133 --> 00:09:51,499
But he's got 30 guests coming.

131
00:09:51,602 --> 00:09:54,628
So we're not gonna do that until 6:05.

132
00:10:01,212 --> 00:10:03,476
Hey, Clinton, I'm bushed.

133
00:10:07,752 --> 00:10:09,481
<i>They said,
"I'm waiting for Hillary's mother. "</i>

134
00:10:09,587 --> 00:10:12,021
<i>You're so nice to wait for her.</i>

135
00:10:13,491 --> 00:10:14,924
Hi, Mom.

136
00:10:15,026 --> 00:10:17,961
The Rolling Stones
have been waiting for you.

137
00:10:24,568 --> 00:10:27,537
Hello. I'm Ronnie.
Very pleased to meet you.

138
00:10:28,105 --> 00:10:30,096
Hello. Nice to see you.

139
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:34,275
Hi, Dorothy.

140
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:39,877
- And there's Charlie.
- Charlie keeps it all going.

141
00:10:42,253 --> 00:10:45,051
- And some inserts of hands and faces.
- Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

142
00:10:45,156 --> 00:10:48,455
<i>This is one of my birthday presents.</i>

143
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:51,119
<i>I get to open for The Rolling Stones.</i>

144
00:10:54,532 --> 00:10:57,433
<i>I want to say a speciaI word of thanks</i>

145
00:10:57,535 --> 00:11:01,335
<i>on behalf of Hillary and Chelsea
and myself</i>

146
00:11:01,439 --> 00:11:06,069
<i>to The Rolling Stones for doing this.</i>

147
00:11:07,478 --> 00:11:11,539
<i>I actually did open
for The Rolling Stones once before.</i>

148
00:11:12,383 --> 00:11:15,978
<i>They did a concert
in Los Angeles in 2001</i>

149
00:11:16,087 --> 00:11:19,716
<i>to raise awareness
of the threat of climate change.</i>

150
00:11:20,124 --> 00:11:22,354
<i>They know as much about these issues
as we do.</i>

151
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:24,553
<i>They care about them
as much as we do.</i>

152
00:11:24,695 --> 00:11:27,789
<i>And that's why
they're giving us this wonderfuI night.</i>

153
00:11:27,898 --> 00:11:30,196
<i>Thank you and God bless you all.</i>

154
00:11:43,314 --> 00:11:46,283
Let's get ready to go.
Everyone, get ready to go.

155
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:52,753
<i>And now, for their second
and finaI appearance</i>

156
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:57,725
<i>at the Beacon Theatre,
please welcome The Rolling Stones!</i>

157
00:11:58,162 --> 00:12:00,892
- Set list.
- Okay, first song.

158
00:16:09,513 --> 00:16:10,605
<i>Thank you.</i>

159
00:16:13,217 --> 00:16:14,980
<i>How you doing? Okay?</i>

160
00:20:25,102 --> 00:20:27,093
<i>You've been doing this
for how many years?</i>

161
00:20:27,204 --> 00:20:28,432
Two years.

162
00:20:28,539 --> 00:20:30,734
And how much longer
do you give yourself doing this,

163
00:20:30,841 --> 00:20:34,800
- going round being a sort of...
- I don't know.

164
00:20:34,912 --> 00:20:37,972
I never thought I'd be doing it
for two years even.

165
00:20:38,081 --> 00:20:41,414
When we started off, I never thought
we'd make it very big anyway.

166
00:20:41,518 --> 00:20:43,679
And now we've been making records
for two years

167
00:20:43,787 --> 00:20:47,723
and everybody still calls us
quite a new group.

168
00:20:47,858 --> 00:20:49,086
I don't know, quite honestly.

169
00:20:49,192 --> 00:20:52,889
I think we're pretty well set up
for at least another year.

170
00:30:24,601 --> 00:30:29,368
Well, if you weren't a music maker,
what would you like to be?

171
00:30:29,472 --> 00:30:31,940
- Design.
- Design what?

172
00:30:32,041 --> 00:30:34,236
A designer, 'cause I was one.

173
00:30:35,778 --> 00:30:39,077
I'd call myself a designer
because I couldn't be a painter.

174
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:42,980
Because I'm not versed well enough
in the language of painting.

175
00:30:43,086 --> 00:30:45,179
I'm not talented enough.

176
00:30:45,288 --> 00:30:47,449
You need talent, surely, and discipline.

177
00:30:47,557 --> 00:30:50,390
No, you need a lot of talent, as well.

178
00:30:50,493 --> 00:30:52,222
What sort of talent?

179
00:30:54,497 --> 00:30:56,362
The talent of knowing.

180
00:30:58,368 --> 00:31:00,836
But knowing comes from discipline.

181
00:31:00,937 --> 00:31:02,461
Not necessarily.

182
00:31:02,572 --> 00:31:05,666
So the talent is to have an imagination?

183
00:31:05,775 --> 00:31:06,935
Yeah.

184
00:31:07,043 --> 00:31:10,240
So do you think you're imaginative
with your work?

185
00:31:11,447 --> 00:31:12,505
Yeah.

186
00:31:17,353 --> 00:31:20,151
Maybe it's just
an inferiority complex I got.

187
00:31:20,256 --> 00:31:22,315
Maybe I'm great after all.

188
00:31:28,031 --> 00:31:30,829
- Who do you think you are?
- Mick Jagger.

189
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:58,554
<i>You've been on your second tour
of the United States for two weeks.</i>

190
00:31:58,661 --> 00:32:01,892
- How was it?
- It was very enjoyable. Most enjoyable.

191
00:32:02,031 --> 00:32:03,362
Very successful, too.

192
00:32:03,466 --> 00:32:07,129
Well, that was not true of the first one,
was it?

193
00:32:07,237 --> 00:32:09,899
Oh, no. But we only came over here
on the first one

194
00:32:10,006 --> 00:32:13,772
so we could get ourselves known,
so to speak.

195
00:32:14,644 --> 00:32:18,546
And when we went back,
things started happening for us.

196
00:32:18,648 --> 00:32:22,140
Well, why did they start happening?

197
00:32:22,252 --> 00:32:25,983
I don't really know.
Some sort of chemical reaction

198
00:32:26,089 --> 00:32:28,023
seemed to happen, somehow.

199
00:32:28,124 --> 00:32:29,819
What would you say happened?

200
00:32:29,926 --> 00:32:32,121
I really don't know quite honestly.

201
00:37:14,043 --> 00:37:15,408
<i>Jack White.</i>

202
00:37:38,601 --> 00:37:42,298
<i>We're gonna do a really old song
for you now.</i>

203
00:37:42,738 --> 00:37:45,468
<i>It's one of the first we ever written.
In fact, we never did it.</i>

204
00:37:45,575 --> 00:37:48,738
<i>We gave it to someone else
'cause we were slightly,</i>

205
00:37:48,844 --> 00:37:51,677
<i>slightly embarrassed about it
the first time we wrote it.</i>

206
00:41:22,658 --> 00:41:23,955
<i>Thank you.</i>

207
00:41:25,494 --> 00:41:27,121
<i>Lovely, isn't it?</i>

208
00:45:50,626 --> 00:45:51,923
<i>Thank you.</i>

209
00:46:14,450 --> 00:46:18,546
<i>Mick Jagger, The Rolling Stones leader,
sentenced to jaiI a month ago, is free.</i>

210
00:46:18,654 --> 00:46:21,248
<i>He has won his appeaI
against the prison sentence.</i>

211
00:46:21,356 --> 00:46:25,588
<i>And tonight he flew by helicopter
to a location 30 miles from London</i>

212
00:46:25,694 --> 00:46:27,719
<i>to appear in World In Action.</i>

213
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:30,628
<i>Publicity on the case is split
between the society</i>

214
00:46:30,732 --> 00:46:33,292
<i>which resents the anarchy of people
like The Stones</i>

215
00:46:33,402 --> 00:46:35,836
<i>and that which favors
greater individuaI freedom.</i>

216
00:46:35,938 --> 00:46:39,135
<i>Tonight, World In Action examines
the reasons for this split.</i>

217
00:46:39,274 --> 00:46:41,037
<i>With Mick Jagger are</i>

218
00:46:42,711 --> 00:46:45,805
<i>William Rees-Mogg,
editor of The Times newspaper,</i>

219
00:46:47,483 --> 00:46:50,714
<i>Father Thomas Corbishley,
a leading British Jesuit,</i>

220
00:46:52,054 --> 00:46:56,991
<i>Lord Stow Hill, who has been
Home Secretary and Attorney GeneraI,</i>

221
00:46:57,092 --> 00:46:59,151
<i>and Dr. John Robinson,

222
00:46:59,261 --> 00:47:01,957
<i>and author of the controversiaI
reassessment of Christianity,</i>

223
00:47:02,064 --> 00:47:03,088
Honest to God.

224
00:47:03,198 --> 00:47:05,325
<i>Mick Jagger has been silent
for three months.</i>

225
00:47:05,434 --> 00:47:07,595
<i>He's read of people
saying he's got what's coming to him</i>

226
00:47:07,703 --> 00:47:11,662
<i>and he read The Times asking
"Who breaks a butterfly on a wheeI?"</i>

227
00:47:13,041 --> 00:47:16,204
I try to keep out of discussions
on religion

228
00:47:16,311 --> 00:47:19,576
such as some pop stars try and get into.

229
00:47:19,681 --> 00:47:23,981
Try to set a good example to teenagers
by being religious.

230
00:47:24,086 --> 00:47:25,815
We're trying to keep out of that.

231
00:47:26,255 --> 00:47:29,588
Ladies and gentlemen,
could I just ask you

232
00:47:29,691 --> 00:47:33,388
to take your pictures
as speedily as possible.

233
00:47:33,529 --> 00:47:35,258
I don't think we're being unreasonable.

234
00:47:35,364 --> 00:47:38,765
I don't propagate drug views
such as some pop stars do.

235
00:47:38,867 --> 00:47:41,734
This whole sort of thing
was pushed upon me.

236
00:47:41,837 --> 00:47:42,861
By whom?

237
00:47:42,971 --> 00:47:45,132
By the mere fact
that I've been prosecuted

238
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:46,969
and also with Keith being prosecuted.

239
00:47:47,075 --> 00:47:49,066
We didn't make a public statement

240
00:47:49,178 --> 00:47:51,009
on religion, on drugs,
or anything like that.

241
00:47:51,113 --> 00:47:52,705
Gentlemen, can I interrupt?

242
00:47:52,814 --> 00:47:56,341
If it continues on that sphere,
then I'll have to cut...

243
00:47:58,020 --> 00:48:02,923
<i>Rolling Stone guitarist Keith Richards
was arrested last night here in Toronto.</i>

244
00:48:09,998 --> 00:48:12,728
<i>Keith Richards,
how will this conviction affect you</i>

245
00:48:12,834 --> 00:48:14,825
<i>and your music
and The Rolling Stones?</i>

246
00:48:14,937 --> 00:48:17,599
I just want to get on with it,
now that it's over.

247
00:48:17,706 --> 00:48:19,731
Do you think
it will have any effect, then?

248
00:48:19,841 --> 00:48:21,274
Might get a song out of it.

249
00:48:21,376 --> 00:48:22,673
<i>Yesterday, after you arrived,</i>

250
00:48:22,778 --> 00:48:25,246
<i>somebody wrote
that on this visit to Australia,</i>

251
00:48:25,347 --> 00:48:27,838
you're about as controversial
as the local vicar.

252
00:48:27,950 --> 00:48:30,942
Does that particular description
offend you or please you?

253
00:48:31,053 --> 00:48:34,921
- Who said that?
- A journalist in Sydney. In a paper.

254
00:48:35,023 --> 00:48:39,483
That's all right. I don't want
to be offensive or controversial.

255
00:48:59,615 --> 00:49:01,606
- Mick Jagger.
- Hi.

256
00:49:06,455 --> 00:49:08,184
This is noticeably different
from Germany.

257
00:49:08,290 --> 00:49:10,622
We're actually in Denmark, not Sweden.

258
00:49:10,726 --> 00:49:12,990
Though you're Swedish,
which is confusing for us.

259
00:49:13,095 --> 00:49:16,531
We'd all like to know what kind of joy

260
00:49:16,632 --> 00:49:21,467
or what kind of thing does it bring you
on a personal or professional level?

261
00:49:24,072 --> 00:49:26,233
It was very enjoyable.

262
00:49:31,013 --> 00:49:35,814
- Could I ask you how old you are?
-29.

263
00:49:37,853 --> 00:49:40,083
Twenty-nine yesterday.

264
00:49:41,123 --> 00:49:44,957
- You are the same age as me.
- Oh, isn't that wonderful?

265
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:48,827
How long do you want to do it?

266
00:49:48,930 --> 00:49:51,125
Do what? Be on the road?

267
00:49:51,233 --> 00:49:53,064
Be The Rolling Stones.

268
00:49:55,971 --> 00:49:59,099
"And what would you do, Mr. Jagger?

269
00:49:59,207 --> 00:50:05,578
"Please tell us what you will do
if you are not Mick Jagger?"

270
00:50:06,248 --> 00:50:08,842
I say, "Well, I'll be somebody else. "

271
00:50:09,451 --> 00:50:12,545
What do you feel just before
you jump onstage

272
00:50:12,654 --> 00:50:15,851
- in front of 100,000 people?
- I wake up.

273
00:50:19,161 --> 00:50:22,961
Well, I usually say to myself,
"You better... do a good show. "

274
00:50:24,132 --> 00:50:27,329
That's what I do. That's my last thought.
"This better be good. "

275
00:50:28,303 --> 00:50:32,399
What is the question, Keith,
that you've been asked the more often?

276
00:50:35,243 --> 00:50:37,541
That question you just asked me.

277
00:50:37,913 --> 00:50:40,108
"How long do you think
you're gonna carry on singing?"

278
00:58:21,033 --> 00:58:23,831
<i>My God, what's up next?</i>

279
00:58:23,936 --> 00:58:27,428
<i>What are you doing
with that strange instrument, Ronnie?</i>

280
00:58:29,808 --> 00:58:31,799
<i>Can you drive that really?</i>

281
00:58:33,912 --> 00:58:37,143
<i>We're gonna do
a little bit of country for you now.</i>

282
00:58:45,824 --> 00:58:48,793
<i>This one we do is called
Far Away Eyes.</i>

283
01:03:20,933 --> 01:03:22,230
<i>Thank you.</i>

284
01:03:28,140 --> 01:03:30,040
<i>Thanks, crackerheads.</i>

285
01:03:38,350 --> 01:03:41,547
<i>Here's a song that was written...</i>

286
01:03:41,653 --> 01:03:43,348
<i>I don't know if it was written
by Muddy Waters,</i>

287
01:03:43,455 --> 01:03:47,084
<i>but I first heard it done
by Muddy Waters.</i>

288
01:03:47,192 --> 01:03:49,854
Champagne and Reefer.

289
01:03:53,098 --> 01:03:56,158
<i>And Buddy Guy is gonna help us out.</i>

290
01:09:24,863 --> 01:09:27,093
<i>Thank you. Buddy Guy!</i>

291
01:09:30,502 --> 01:09:32,936
<i>Buddy... Guy.</i>

292
01:09:33,772 --> 01:09:35,103
It's yours.

293
01:15:07,372 --> 01:15:08,805
<i>Thank you!</i>

294
01:15:10,908 --> 01:15:12,535
<i>You're being wonderfuI.</i>

295
01:15:12,644 --> 01:15:16,011
<i>You've been a... great audience,
I tell you.</i>

296
01:15:16,114 --> 01:15:17,672
<i>Lord have mercy.</i>

297
01:15:20,718 --> 01:15:22,345
<i>You're sounding good,
you're looking good,</i>

298
01:15:22,453 --> 01:15:24,114
<i>you're doing everything you should.</i>

299
01:15:24,222 --> 01:15:26,087
<i>I'm going to tell you
who's up here tonight,</i>

300
01:15:26,190 --> 01:15:28,055
<i>who's playing and singing
and carrying on.</i>

301
01:15:28,159 --> 01:15:29,558
<i>First I want to introduce you...</i>

302
01:15:29,661 --> 01:15:33,324
<i>From Queens, a very beautifuI lady,
Miss Lisa Fischer!</i>

303
01:15:41,005 --> 01:15:42,370
<i>I fucked up.</i>

304
01:15:44,075 --> 01:15:47,511
<i>She's not from Queens,
she's from Brooklyn! I'm sorry.</i>

305
01:15:51,182 --> 01:15:53,810
<i>You're from Queens, right?
You're from Queens.</i>

306
01:15:53,918 --> 01:15:56,409
<i>I got this one.</i>

307
01:15:56,521 --> 01:16:00,855
<i>Right behind her, from Queens,
Mr. Bernard Fowler!</i>

308
01:16:00,958 --> 01:16:03,791
<i>From South Africa, Mr. Blondie Chaplin.</i>

309
01:16:03,895 --> 01:16:08,559
<i>Tim Ries. MichaeI Davis. Kent Smith.</i>

310
01:16:08,700 --> 01:16:11,134
<i>On the tenor saxophone, Bobby Keys.</i>

311
01:16:11,235 --> 01:16:14,068
<i>On the keyboards, Chuck Leavell.</i>

312
01:16:16,841 --> 01:16:19,002
<i>On the bass, DarryI Jones.</i>

313
01:16:20,445 --> 01:16:24,848
<i>On the guitar, rocking Ronnie Wood!</i>

314
01:16:31,689 --> 01:16:34,351
<i>They love you, Ronnie.
They really love you.</i>

315
01:16:34,492 --> 01:16:37,461
<i>On the drums,</i>

316
01:16:37,562 --> 01:16:41,589
<i>Mr. Wang dang doodle, Charlie Watts.</i>

317
01:16:46,537 --> 01:16:49,404
<i>- Want to say hello?
- Hello.</i>

318
01:16:50,608 --> 01:16:51,939
<i>He speaks.</i>

319
01:17:00,885 --> 01:17:04,286
<i>On the guitar,
and now the vocals, Keith Richards!</i>

320
01:17:25,977 --> 01:17:27,410
<i>Good evening.</i>

321
01:17:30,715 --> 01:17:33,240
<i>How did that come across? All right?</i>

322
01:17:35,787 --> 01:17:38,255
<i>It's good to see you all, you know.</i>

323
01:17:40,691 --> 01:17:42,659
<i>It's good to see anybody.</i>

324
01:17:48,633 --> 01:17:50,828
<i>So if you're all all right...</i>

325
01:17:52,470 --> 01:17:54,097
<i>Hey, baby in blue.</i>

326
01:17:56,440 --> 01:17:59,170
<i>We're gonna go on and
You Got The Silver.</i>

327
01:21:14,672 --> 01:21:16,299
<i>Thank you, Ronnie.</i>

328
01:21:20,344 --> 01:21:21,675
<i>CooI, huh?</i>

329
01:21:28,419 --> 01:21:32,685
- Well, how are you physically?
- Me? I'm fantastic, baby.

330
01:21:33,991 --> 01:21:36,289
- Are you up for this tour?
- Sure.

331
01:21:37,128 --> 01:21:40,996
The other word on the street
is that this is the proverbial last tour.

332
01:21:41,098 --> 01:21:45,865
Yeah, so they said
in '75, '72, '69, et cetera.

333
01:21:45,970 --> 01:21:47,904
We didn't say it.

334
01:21:48,005 --> 01:21:50,530
How have you survived? All the bad...

335
01:21:50,641 --> 01:21:53,201
The answer is
not to keep asking yourself

336
01:21:53,310 --> 01:21:56,040
how you do it as long as you do it.

337
01:21:56,147 --> 01:21:58,877
I don't try and analyze it.

338
01:21:58,983 --> 01:22:00,041
My luck hasn't run out yet.

339
01:23:00,911 --> 01:23:04,108
<i>Onstage, does your mind wander off
or are you always in the guitar?</i>

340
01:23:06,317 --> 01:23:08,945
I don't think onstage. I feel.

341
01:23:09,053 --> 01:23:13,490
<i>Up there, you're just who you are.
You're not thinking.</i>

342
01:23:13,624 --> 01:23:18,357
<i>When we get up there,
we're in our own little zone.</i>

343
01:23:20,364 --> 01:23:23,162
We love what we do.

344
01:23:42,286 --> 01:23:44,516
<i>As a man, what's Keith's best point?</i>

345
01:23:44,622 --> 01:23:50,959
Well, he's very moral
and he's very caring, unlike his image.

346
01:23:51,061 --> 01:23:53,188
In the bad old days or the good old days

347
01:23:53,297 --> 01:23:56,357
was he really as mad
as all the books say?

348
01:23:56,467 --> 01:23:59,334
- And were you?
- Yeah. And Keith still is.

349
01:23:59,436 --> 01:24:00,801
And so am I, really.

350
01:24:08,779 --> 01:24:12,681
Ronnie says that the hardest thing
is keeping up with you.

351
01:24:12,783 --> 01:24:14,114
Generally in life.

352
01:24:14,218 --> 01:24:15,776
And he thinks one of the reasons
he got the gig is

353
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:17,888
'cause he could stay the pace.

354
01:24:17,988 --> 01:24:21,515
- Is he pretty tough?
- He's tough, but I wear him out.

355
01:24:25,663 --> 01:24:27,597
Is Ronnie your right hand,
your left hand?

356
01:24:27,698 --> 01:24:30,929
Is he your pal, your twin?

357
01:24:31,035 --> 01:24:34,129
Good question.
Ronnie and I, we're like that.

358
01:24:34,238 --> 01:24:37,435
And also we're like that.

359
01:24:37,541 --> 01:24:39,771
Who's the best guitarist? You or Keith?

360
01:24:39,877 --> 01:24:41,811
Oh, well, he knows I am.

361
01:24:43,547 --> 01:24:47,608
- How would you answer that question?
- Nobody is interested in being the best.

362
01:24:47,718 --> 01:24:52,849
- He said he was definitely the best.
- I know he'd say that. Yeah.

363
01:24:53,724 --> 01:24:58,184
But I know the truth,
which is like, we're both pretty lousy,

364
01:24:58,295 --> 01:25:00,559
but together we're better than 10 others.

365
01:25:31,495 --> 01:25:35,591
<i>I guess you know the feeling.
Gold rings on you all. Bless you.</i>

366
01:33:43,787 --> 01:33:46,085
<i>You're sounding good out there.</i>

367
01:37:35,719 --> 01:37:38,654
<i>Thank you, Christina Aguilera.</i>

368
01:37:38,755 --> 01:37:40,518
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

369
01:37:47,731 --> 01:37:50,757
<i>All right! I loved it.</i>

370
01:38:01,111 --> 01:38:04,012
<i>Are you feeling good?</i>

371
01:38:04,114 --> 01:38:05,911
<i>Are you feeling good?</i>

372
01:38:06,950 --> 01:38:08,850
<i>Come on and say, "Yeah. "</i>

373
01:41:49,572 --> 01:41:51,767
<i>Thank you so much, everybody!</i>

374
01:41:58,314 --> 01:42:00,714
<i>Good night, and thank you so much.</i>

375
01:42:14,664 --> 01:42:18,156
<i>August 4th, 1972.</i>

376
01:42:18,268 --> 01:42:21,431
<i>Cavett meets The Rolling Stones.</i>

377
01:42:24,307 --> 01:42:26,241
Is there ever a temptation

378
01:42:26,342 --> 01:42:29,834
when a whole audience is out there
waiting for you to chuck it,

379
01:42:29,946 --> 01:42:33,109
and to just say, "I can't go on,
they're asking too much of me. "

380
01:42:33,216 --> 01:42:36,185
You earn every cent
with that performance you give.

381
01:42:36,286 --> 01:42:38,117
The exercise, the energy.

382
01:42:38,221 --> 01:42:40,712
You lose probably 10 pounds a night.

383
01:42:41,524 --> 01:42:43,958
- I can't remember the question.
- I can't either.

384
01:42:44,060 --> 01:42:46,051
I've completely lost sight of it.

385
01:42:47,830 --> 01:42:49,821
Yeah, there is a temptation
some nights.

386
01:42:49,932 --> 01:42:53,561
When you have a real problem
to get there.

387
01:42:53,670 --> 01:42:56,537
Like the other night
when we were in jail.

388
01:42:56,639 --> 01:42:58,038
In jail?

389
01:42:58,141 --> 01:43:01,702
Keith was on one side of this wall
and I was on the other.

390
01:43:01,811 --> 01:43:04,939
And I say, "We're not gonna make it,
so let's forget about it

391
01:43:05,048 --> 01:43:06,208
"and not try and make it. "

392
01:43:06,316 --> 01:43:09,285
So Keith says, "We got to make it. "
So I say, "Okay, we'll make it. "

393
01:43:09,385 --> 01:43:12,946
So we start yelling,
"We got to make it, we got to make it".

394
01:43:13,056 --> 01:43:17,254
We didn't have to.
They did it all. They got us out.

395
01:43:18,161 --> 01:43:21,187
Can you picture yourself at the age 60
doing what you do now?

396
01:43:21,297 --> 01:43:23,162
- Yeah, easily, yeah.
- Really?

397
01:49:01,404 --> 01:49:03,872
<i>Those lights are burning up my ass!</i>

398
01:54:00,102 --> 01:54:02,297
<i>Thank you so much. Thank you.</i>

399
01:54:02,404 --> 01:54:04,167
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

400
01:56:04,726 --> 01:56:06,489
Put my robe on right.

401
01:56:31,553 --> 01:56:33,680
Go, go, go, go, go.

402
01:56:34,623 --> 01:56:36,488
Up! Up!

403
01:59:34,236 --> 01:59:36,466
<i>Ripped into failure.</i>

404
02:01:35,590 --> 02:01:39,082
<i>So how's the audience gonna be
with all these cameras?</i>

405
02:01:40,305 --> 02:01:46,881
