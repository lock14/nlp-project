00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:40,265
OK... Here we go. Focus.

3
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:43,707
Speed. I am speed.

4
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:48,142
One winner, 42 losers.

5
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:50,774
I eat losers for breakfast.

6
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,319
Breakfast.

7
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:56,480
Wait, maybe I
should have had breakfast.

8
00:00:56,556 --> 00:01:00,253
A little breck-y could be good for me.
No, no, no, stay focused. Speed.

9
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:04,191
I'm faster than fast.
Quicker than quick.

10
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:05,856
I am lightning!

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,298
Hey, Lightning! You ready?

12
00:01:10,937 --> 00:01:14,100
Oh, yeah. Lightning's ready

13
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:53,470
Ka-chow!

14
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,651
Get your antenna balls here!

15
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:51,396
Go, Lightnin'!

16
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:55,464
- Whoo!
- You got that right, slick.

17
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:10,979
Uh!

18
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:24,300
Welcome back to the Dinoco 400.

19
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,999
I'm Bob Cutlass, here
with my good friend, Darrell Cartrip.

20
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:31,066
<i>We're midway through what may
be an historic day for racing.</i>

21
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:33,169
<i>Bob, my oil pressure's
through the roof.</i>

22
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:36,841
<i>If this gets more exciting, they're
gonna have to tow me outta the booth!</i>

23
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:37,974
<i>Right, Darrell.</i>

24
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,679
<i>Three cars are tied
for the season points lead,</i>

25
00:03:40,753 --> 00:03:42,846
<i>heading into the final race
of the season.</i>

26
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:47,689
<i>And the winner of this race will win
the season title and the Piston Cup.</i>

27
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,455
<i>Does The King, Strip Weathers,</i>

28
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:51,929
<i>have one more victory in him
before retirement?</i>

29
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:54,592
<i>He's been Dinoco's golden boy
for years!</i>

30
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:56,862
<i>Can he win them one last Piston Cup?</i>

31
00:03:56,936 --> 00:04:00,303
<i>And, as always, in the
second place spot we find Chick Hicks.</i>

32
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:02,898
<i>He's been chasing
that tailfin his entire career.</i>

33
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:05,137
<i>Chick thought
this was his year.</i>

34
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:07,975
<i>His chance to finally emerge
from The King's shadow.</i>

35
00:04:08,047 --> 00:04:12,108
<i>But the last thing he expected was...
Lightning McQueen!</i>

36
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:14,813
<i>You know, I don't think
anybody expected this.</i>

37
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:17,515
<i>The rookie sensation
came into the season unknown.</i>

38
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,080
<i>But everyone knows him now.</i>

39
00:04:19,158 --> 00:04:23,219
<i>Will he be the first rookie
to win a Piston Cup and land Dinoco?</i>

40
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:25,889
<i>The legend, the runner-up,
and the rookie!</i>

41
00:04:25,965 --> 00:04:28,832
<i>Three cars, one champion!</i>

42
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:42,504
No you don't.

43
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:47,209
Hey!

44
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:56,093
What a ride!

45
00:04:57,497 --> 00:04:59,692
Go get 'em, McQueen!
Go get 'em!

46
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:05,334
I love you, Lightning!

47
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:08,067
Dinoco is all mine.

48
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,075
Trouble, turn three!

49
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:13,374
- Get through that, McQueen.
- Huge crash behind the leaders!

50
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:38,135
Wait a second, Darrell.
McQueen is in the wreckage.

51
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:41,037
There's no way the rookie
can make it through!

52
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:42,335
Not in one piece, that is.

53
00:05:56,956 --> 00:05:58,651
Yeah!

54
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:00,693
Lightning! Oh!

55
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:05,063
Look at that!
McQueen made it through!

56
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:07,599
A spectacular move
by Lightning McQueen!

57
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:09,794
Yeah! Ka-chow!

58
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:13,134
McQueen! McQueen! McQueen!
McQueen! McQueen! McQueen!

59
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:16,175
Yeah, McQueen! Ka-chow!

60
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:18,472
While everyone
heads into the pits,

61
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,307
McQueen stays out to take the lead!

62
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,372
Don't take me out, coach.
I can still race!

63
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:30,589
What do you think?
A thing of beauty.

64
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:32,590
- McQueen made it!
- What?

65
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:33,716
He's not pitting!

66
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:36,921
You gotta get me out there!
Let's go! Get me back out there!

67
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:38,759
McQueen's not going into the pits!

68
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:42,392
The rookie fired his
crew chief. The third this season!

69
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:44,766
- Says he likes working alone.
- Go, go!

70
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:47,067
Looks like Chick
got caught up in the pits.

71
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:50,541
Yeah, after a stop like that,
he's got a lot of ground to make up.

72
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:53,010
Get ready, boys,
we're coming to the restart!

73
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,993
Come on, come on, come on!

74
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:23,467
We need tires now!
Come on, let's go!

75
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:26,239
- No, no, no, no! No tires, just gas!
- What?

76
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:28,438
You need tires, you idiot!

77
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:31,750
Looks like it's
gas-and-go's for McQueen today.

78
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:33,251
Right. No tires again.

79
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:36,015
That's a short-term gain,
long-term loss,

80
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:39,751
but it's workin' for him. He obviously
knows somethin' we don't know.

81
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:52,099
This is it, Darrell. One lap to go
and Lightning McQueen has a huge lead.

82
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:55,038
He's got it in the bag.
Call in the dogs and put out the fire!

83
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:57,405
We're gonna crown us a new champion!

84
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:06,113
Checkered flag, here I come!

85
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:08,176
No! McQueen's blown a tire!

86
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:10,984
And with only one turn to go!
Can he make it?

87
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:13,617
You fool!

88
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,462
McQueen's blown a tire!
He's blown a tire!

89
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,020
Go, go, go!

90
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:29,936
He's lost another tire!

91
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:33,240
- King and Chick come up fast!
- They're entering turn three!

92
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:35,177
Come on.

93
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:39,279
I don't believe
what I'm watching, Bob!

94
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:42,879
Lightning McQueen
is 100 feet from his Piston Cup!

95
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:51,222
The King and Chick
rounding turn four.

96
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,365
Down the stretch they come!
And it's, and it's...

97
00:08:57,436 --> 00:09:00,234
- It's too close to call! Too close!
- I don't believe it!

98
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:01,671
Lightning!

99
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:04,966
- The most spectacular, amazing...
- I don't believe it!

100
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:08,502
...unequivocally, unbelievable ending
in the history of the world!

101
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:10,606
- And we don't know who won!
- Look at that!

102
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:24,320
- That's very close to call.
- Can we play that again?

103
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,592
Hey, no cameras! Get outta here!

104
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:29,200
<i>We're here in Victory Lane,
awaiting the results.</i>

105
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:31,736
<i>McQueen, that was a risky move,
not taking tires.</i>

106
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:32,793
<i>Tell me about it!</i>

107
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:35,534
<i>Are you sorry you didn't have
a crew chief out there?</i>

108
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:39,044
<i>Oh, Kori. There's a lot more to racing
than just winning.</i>

109
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:43,013
<i>I mean, taking the race by a full lap...
Where's the entertainment in that?</i>

110
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:45,016
<i>I wanted to give folks a little sizzle.</i>

111
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,211
<i>- Sizzle?
- Am I sorry I don't have a crew chief?</i>

112
00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:49,447
<i>No, I'm not.
'Cause I'm a one-man show.</i>

113
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:50,955
<i>What? Oh, yeah, right.</i>

114
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:53,082
<i>That was a confident
Lightning McQueen.</i>

115
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:55,787
Live from Victory Lane,
I'm Kori Turbowitz.

116
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:57,556
- Get outta the shot.
- Yo, Chuck.

117
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,325
Chuck, what are you doing?
You're blockin' the camera!

118
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:01,389
- Everyone wants to see the bolt.
- What?

119
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:05,062
- Now, back away.
- That's it! Come on, guys.

120
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:09,198
- Whoa, team! Where are you going?
- We quit, Mr. One-Man Show!

121
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,970
Oh, OK, leave. Fine.

122
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:14,809
How will I ever find anyone else
who knows how to fill me up with gas?

123
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:18,849
- Adios, Chuck!
- And my name is not Chuck!

124
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:20,579
Oh, whatever.

125
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:22,678
Hey, Lightning! Yo! McQueen!

126
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:26,054
Seriously, that was some
pretty darn nice racin' out there.

127
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,355
- By me!
- Oh, yeah.

128
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:30,952
- Zinger!
- Welcome to the Chick era, baby!

129
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:33,692
The Piston Cup...
It's mine, dude. It's mine.

130
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:38,328
Hey, fellas, how do you think
I'd look in Dinoco blue? Dinoco blue!

131
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:40,235
In your dreams, Thunder.

132
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:43,400
Yeah, right. Thunder?
What's he talkin' about, "Thunder"?

133
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:46,309
You know, 'cause thunder
always comes after lightning.

134
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:48,176
Ka-ping! Ka-pow!

135
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:50,681
- Who knew about the thunder thing?
- I didn't.

136
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,445
- Give us the bolt!
- That's right.

137
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:53,985
Right in the lens.

138
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,314
- Show me the bolt, baby!
- Smile, McQueen!

139
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:59,688
- Show me the bolt, McQueen!
- That's it!

140
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:09,457
That was one close finish.
You sure made Dinoco proud.

141
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:10,524
Thank you, King.

142
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:13,367
Well, Tex, you've been
good to me all these years.

143
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:14,804
It's the least I could do.

144
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:18,105
Whatever happens, you're a winner
to me, you old daddy rabbit.

145
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:20,975
Thanks, dear.
Wouldn't be nothing without you.

146
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:22,742
Kch-i-ka-chow!

147
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:25,477
- I'm Mia.
- I'm Tia.

148
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:28,816
We're, like, your biggest fans!
Ka-chow!

149
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:31,379
I love being me.

150
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:34,551
- OK, girls, that's it.
- We love you, Lightning!

151
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:39,362
Hey, buddy.
You're one gutsy racer.

152
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:40,990
Oh, hey, Mr. The King.

153
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:42,864
You got more talent in one lug nut

154
00:11:42,935 --> 00:11:45,495
than a lot of cars has got
in their whole body.

155
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:48,165
- Really? Oh, that...
- But you're stupid.

156
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,800
- Excuse me?
- This ain't a one-man deal, kid.

157
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:53,970
You need to wise up and get
a good crew chief and a good team.

158
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:57,072
You ain't gonna win
unless you got good folks behind you,

159
00:11:57,149 --> 00:12:00,448
and you let them
do their job, like they should.

160
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:03,249
- Like I tell the boys at the shop...
- A good team.

161
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:05,222
Yeah...

162
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:14,522
Ka-chow! Ka-pow!

163
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,311
Oh, Lightning!

164
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:40,590
If you figure that out
you just gonna be OK.

165
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:44,288
Oh, yeah, that...
That is spectacular advice.

166
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:45,796
Thank you, Mr. The King.

167
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:47,958
Ladies and gentlemen,

168
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:50,263
for the first time
in Piston Cup history...

169
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:54,033
A rookie
has won the Piston Cup.

170
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,498
Yes!

171
00:12:55,574 --> 00:12:58,509
...we have a three-way tie.

172
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:08,218
Hey,
that must be really embarrassing.

173
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,949
But I wouldn't worry about it.
Because I didn't do it!

174
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:15,425
Piston Cup officials
have determined that a tiebreaker race

175
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:19,726
between the three leaders
will be held in California in one week.

176
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:23,230
Well, thank you! Thanks to
all of you out there! Thank you!

177
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:26,999
Hey, first one to
California gets Dinoco all to himself.

178
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:30,041
No, not me!
No, you rock, and you know that!

179
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:36,544
Oh, yeah! Whoo!

180
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:39,746
Yep! All right! Got it!

181
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:43,277
"First one to California
gets Dinoco all to himself. "

182
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:45,983
Oh, we'll see
who gets there first, Chick.

183
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:47,150
Huh?

184
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:50,559
- Hey, kid! Congrats on the tie.
- I don't want to talk about it.

185
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:53,496
Let's go, Mack. Saddle up.
What'd you do with my trailer?

186
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:55,761
- I parked it at your sponsor's tent.
- What?

187
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,826
Gotta make your personal appearance.

188
00:13:57,903 --> 00:14:00,463
No. No! No, no, no, no!

189
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:03,006
<i>Yes, yes, yes!
Lightning McQueen here.</i>

190
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:06,704
<i>And I use Rust-eze Medicated
Bumper Ointment, new rear end formula!</i>

191
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:10,476
<i>Nothing soothes a rusty bumper
like Rust-eze.</i>

192
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:13,317
<i>Wow! Look at that shine!</i>

193
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:17,116
<i>Use Rust-eze and you too
can look like me!</i>

194
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:18,451
<i>Ka-chow!</i>

195
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,718
I met this car from Swampscott.

196
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:26,856
He was so rusty
he didn't even cast a shadow.

197
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:29,799
You could see his dirty undercarriage.

198
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:34,101
I hate rusty cars.
This is not good for my image.

199
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:37,574
They did give you your big break.
Besides, it's in your contract.

200
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:40,544
Oh, will you stop, please?
Just go get hooked up.

201
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:44,572
- Winter is a grand old time.
- Of this there are no ifs or buts.

202
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:47,084
But remember,
all that salt and grime...

203
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:49,120
Can rust your bolts and freeze your...

204
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:51,156
Hey, look! There he is!

205
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:53,191
Our almost champ!

206
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:54,920
Get your rear end in here.

207
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:57,019
Lightning McQueen,
you are wicked fast!

208
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:59,257
- That race was a pisser!
- You were booking!

209
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:01,390
- Give me a little room.
- You're my hero!

210
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:03,298
Yes, I know.

211
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:04,927
"Fred. " Fred, thank you.

212
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,595
He knows my name.
He knows my name!

213
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,634
Looking good, Freddie!

214
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:12,176
Thanks to you, Lightning,
we had a banner year!

215
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,769
We might clear enough
to buy you some headlights.

216
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:16,872
You saying he doesn't have headlights?

217
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:19,281
That's what I'm telling ya.
They're stickers!

218
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:22,343
Well, you know,
racecars don't need headlights,

219
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,412
because the track is always lit.

220
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:27,687
Yeah, well, so is my brother,
but he still needs headlights.

221
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:36,364
- Ladies and gentlemen,
- Lightning McQueen!

222
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:41,272
Free Bird!

223
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:44,673
You know, the Rust-eze Medicated
Bumper Ointment team

224
00:15:44,743 --> 00:15:46,608
ran a great race today.

225
00:15:47,012 --> 00:15:49,344
And remember, with a little Rust-eze...

226
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,609
And an insane
amount of luck,

227
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:56,212
...you too, can look like me.
Ka-chow.

228
00:15:58,857 --> 00:16:00,324
- Hey, kid.
- We love ya.

229
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:02,860
And we're looking forward
to another great year.

230
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:04,225
Just like this year!

231
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,099
Not on your life.

232
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:11,895
- Don't drive like my brother!
- Yeah, don't drive like my brother!

233
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,963
<i>California, here we come!</i>

234
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:17,736
Dinoco, here we come!

235
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:11,480
Oh... oh... uh,
I needed this. Hello?

236
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:15,152
<i>Is this Lightning McQueen,
the world's fastest racing machine?</i>

237
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:17,354
Is this Harv,
the world's greatest agent?

238
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:20,193
<i>And it is such an honor
to be your agent</i>

239
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:23,291
<i>that it almost hurts me to take
ten percent of your winnings.</i>

240
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:28,465
<i>Merchandising. And ancillary rights in
perpetuity. Anyway, what a race, champ!</i>

241
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:31,031
<i>I didn't see it,
but I heard you were great.</i>

242
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,236
Thanks, Harv.

243
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:35,974
<i>Listen, they're giving you 20 tickets
for the tiebreaker thing in Cali.</i>

244
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:38,744
<i>I'll pass 'em on to your friends.
Shoot me the names.</i>

245
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:41,945
<i>- You let Harv rock it for you, baby.
- Right. Friends.</i>

246
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,954
Yes, there's...

247
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:47,486
<i>OK, I get it, Mr. Popular.</i>

248
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:50,687
<i>So many you can't even narrow it down.
Hey, when you get to town,</i>

249
00:18:50,762 --> 00:18:52,923
<i>you better make time
for your best friend!</i>

250
00:18:52,998 --> 00:18:55,159
<i>Break bread
with your mishpocheh here!</i>

251
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:57,293
That'd be great!
We should totally...

252
00:18:57,369 --> 00:19:00,133
<i>OK, I gotta jump, kid.
Let me know how it goes. I'm out.</i>

253
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:06,468
What? A minivan?

254
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:08,240
<i>Come on, you're in the slow lane.</i>

255
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:10,645
<i>This is Lightning McQueen
you're hauling here.</i>

256
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:13,241
Just stopping off
for a quick breather, kid.

257
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:15,752
<i>- Old Mack needs a rest.
- Absolutely not.</i>

258
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:19,552
<i>We're driving all night till we
get to California. We agreed to it.</i>

259
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:23,823
All night? May I remind you
federal DOT regs state...

260
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:26,956
<i>Come on, I need to get there
before Chick and hang with Dinoco.</i>

261
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:29,125
All those sleeping trucks.

262
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:31,931
<i>Hey, kid,
I don't know if I can make it.</i>

263
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,437
Oh, sure you can, Mack.

264
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,837
Look, it'll be easy.
I'll stay up with you.

265
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:38,775
<i>- All night?
- All night long.</i>

266
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:59,190
Uh!

267
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:43,798
Ah-choo!

268
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,891
- Hey, yo, D.J.
- What up?

269
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,984
We got ourselves a nodder.

270
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:12,870
Pretty music.

271
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:16,339
Yo, Wingo! Lane change, man.

272
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:18,907
- Right back at ya!
- Yeah!

273
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:22,071
- Oops! I missed.
- You going on vacation?

274
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:44,832
- Oh, no, Snot Rod...
- He's gonna blow!

275
00:21:44,903 --> 00:21:47,736
Ah... Ah... Ah-choo!

276
00:21:47,906 --> 00:21:49,100
Gesundheit!

277
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:53,270
One should never drive while drowsy.

278
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:08,785
Uh! Ah!

279
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:14,265
Mack!

280
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,503
Mack!

281
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:28,704
Mack!

282
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:31,613
Hey, Mack! Mack!

283
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:35,277
Mack!

284
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,879
Mack, wait for me!

285
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:47,693
Mack!

286
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:10,346
Mack! Mack!

287
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,992
Mack! Mack...

288
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,528
...wait up! Mack.

289
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:20,527
Mack! Mack!

290
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:22,794
What? You're not Mack.

291
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:27,635
Mack? I ain't no Mack!
I'm a Peterbilt, for dang sake!

292
00:23:28,006 --> 00:23:30,634
Turn on your lights, you moron!

293
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:37,741
Mack... The Interstate!

294
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:52,296
Huh?

295
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:55,231
Not in my town, you don't.

296
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:01,334
Oh, no.

297
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,965
Oh, maybe he can help me!

298
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:06,306
He's shooting at me!
Why is he shooting at me?

299
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:09,743
I haven't gone this fast in years.

300
00:24:09,815 --> 00:24:12,648
I'm gonna
blow a gasket or somethin'.

301
00:24:12,717 --> 00:24:15,049
Serpentine! Serpentine, serpentine!

302
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,815
What in the blue blazes?

303
00:24:16,888 --> 00:24:18,412
Crazy hot-rodder.

304
00:25:19,417 --> 00:25:24,013
I'm telling you, man,
every third blink is slower.

305
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:31,189
The sixties weren't good to you,
were they?

306
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:43,802
What? That's not the Interstate!

307
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,740
Ah! Oh!

308
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:49,109
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

309
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:54,549
No, no, no, no, no, no!

310
00:25:55,954 --> 00:25:57,046
Ow!

311
00:25:59,257 --> 00:26:02,283
I'm not the only one seeing this, right?

312
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:04,422
- Incoming!
- Whoa, man.

313
00:26:04,496 --> 00:26:05,827
- No!
- Hey!

314
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:08,162
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

315
00:26:09,134 --> 00:26:10,396
My tires!

316
00:26:56,047 --> 00:26:59,278
Fly away, Stanley. Be free!

317
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,396
Boy, you're in a heap of trouble.

318
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:18,564
<i>We're live at the Los Angeles
International Speedway</i>

319
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:21,162
<i>as the first competitor,
Lightning McQueen,</i>

320
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:23,537
<i>is arriving at the track.</i>

321
00:27:23,608 --> 00:27:25,542
<i>Is it true he's gonna pose for Cargirl?</i>

322
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:26,770
<i>What's your strategy?</i>

323
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:31,509
<i>What? Did I forget
to wipe my mud flaps?</i>

324
00:27:33,051 --> 00:27:36,418
<i>McQueen's driver arrived in California,
but McQueen was missing.</i>

325
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:40,447
<i>- McQueen was reported missing.
- ... to race an unprecedented...</i>

326
00:27:40,525 --> 00:27:43,085
<i>Sponsor stated
they have no idea where he is.</i>

327
00:27:46,031 --> 00:27:49,523
I hope Lightning's OK. I'd hate
to see anything bad happen to him.

328
00:27:49,601 --> 00:27:53,799
<i>I don't know what's harder to find,
McQueen or a chief who'll work with him!</i>

329
00:27:53,872 --> 00:27:56,966
<i>Lightning McQueen
must be found at all costs!</i>

330
00:27:57,042 --> 00:28:01,001
<i>They're all asking the same question:
Where is McQueen?</i>

331
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,141
Oh, boy.

332
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:07,277
Where am I?

333
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:09,944
- Mornin', sleepin' beauty!
- Ah!

334
00:28:10,655 --> 00:28:13,146
Boy, I was wonderin'
when you was gonna wake up.

335
00:28:13,224 --> 00:28:15,920
Take whatever you want!
Just don't hurt me!

336
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:18,890
A parking boot?
Why do I have a parking boot on?

337
00:28:18,963 --> 00:28:23,923
- What's going on here? Please!
- You're funny.

338
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:27,062
I like you already. My name's Mater.

339
00:28:28,573 --> 00:28:29,562
Mater?

340
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:32,576
Yeah, like "tuh-mater,"
but without the "tuh".

341
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:35,909
- What's your name?
- You don't know my name?

342
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:36,969
Uh...

343
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:40,449
No, I know your name.
Is your name Mater too?

344
00:28:40,518 --> 00:28:41,542
What?

345
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:46,386
Look, I need to get to California
as fast as possible. Where am I?

346
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:48,722
Where are you? Shoot!

347
00:28:48,793 --> 00:28:50,351
You're in Radiator Springs.

348
00:28:50,428 --> 00:28:53,829
The cutest little town
in Carburetor County.

349
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:56,765
Oh, great. Just great!

350
00:28:56,835 --> 00:29:01,363
Well, if you think that's great,
you should see the rest of the town.

351
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:05,239
You know,
I'd love to see the rest of the town!

352
00:29:05,443 --> 00:29:08,276
So if you could just open the gate,
take this boot off,

353
00:29:08,346 --> 00:29:11,076
you and me, we go cruisin',
check out the local scene...

354
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:13,379
- Dad-gum!
- How'd that be, Tuhmater?

355
00:29:13,451 --> 00:29:14,975
- Cool!
- Mater!

356
00:29:15,053 --> 00:29:17,920
What did I tell you
about talkin' to the accused?

357
00:29:17,989 --> 00:29:19,479
To not to.

358
00:29:19,557 --> 00:29:23,994
Well, quit your yappin' and tow this
delinquent road hazard to traffic court.

359
00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:26,155
Well, we'll talk later, Mater.

360
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:29,098
"Later, Mater. "
That's funny!

361
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:30,356
Ah!

362
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:34,132
The Radiator Springs
Traffic Court will come to order!

363
00:29:34,205 --> 00:29:37,732
Hey, you scratched my paint!
I oughta take a blowtorch to you, man!

364
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:40,209
You broke-a the road!
You a very bad car!

365
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:41,302
- Fascist!
- Commie!

366
00:29:41,379 --> 00:29:44,075
Officer, talk to me, babe.
How long is this gonna take?

367
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:45,912
I gotta get to California, pronto.

368
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:47,144
Where's your lawyer?

369
00:29:47,218 --> 00:29:50,483
I don't know. Tahiti maybe.
He's got a timeshare there.

370
00:29:50,555 --> 00:29:55,686
When a defendant has no lawyer,
the court will assign one to him. Hey!

371
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,751
Anyone want to be his lawyer?

372
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,462
Shoot, I'll do it, Sheriff!

373
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:05,299
All rise! The Honorable
Doc Hudson presiding.

374
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:06,763
Show-off.

375
00:30:06,838 --> 00:30:10,171
May Doc have mercy on your soul.

376
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:11,435
All right,

377
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:14,637
I wanna know who's responsible
for wreckin' my town, Sheriff.

378
00:30:14,712 --> 00:30:16,612
I want his hood on a platter!

379
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:19,343
I'm gonna put him in jail till he rots!
No, check that.

380
00:30:19,417 --> 00:30:23,183
I'm gonna put him in jail till
the jail rots on top of him,

381
00:30:23,254 --> 00:30:26,917
and then I'm gonna move him
to a new jail and let that jail rot.

382
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:28,515
I'm...

383
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:32,429
Throw him out of here, Sheriff.

384
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:35,864
I want him out of my courtroom.
I want him out of our town!

385
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,592
- Case dismissed.
- Yes!

386
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,933
Boy, I'm purty good
at this lawyerin' stuff.

387
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:41,471
Sorry I'm late, Your Honor!

388
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:46,500
Holy Porsche! She's gotta be
from my attorney's office.

389
00:30:46,578 --> 00:30:49,046
Hey, thanks for comin',
but we're all set.

390
00:30:49,113 --> 00:30:51,547
- He's letting me go.
- He's letting you go?

391
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:53,550
Yeah, your job's pretty easy today.

392
00:30:53,618 --> 00:30:56,781
All you have to do now is stand there
and let me look at you.

393
00:30:56,855 --> 00:31:00,416
Listen, I'm gonna cut to the chase.
Me, you, dinner. Pi-cha-kow!

394
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:02,452
- What the...? Ow! Oh!
- Ka-chow!

395
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:05,587
- Please!
- I know. I get that reaction a lot.

396
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:09,257
I create feelings in others that
they themselves don't understand.

397
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:10,995
Agh! Ow!

398
00:31:11,069 --> 00:31:13,469
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I scare you?

399
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:15,563
A little bit, but I'll be all right.

400
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:19,406
OK. I'm gonna go talk to the judge.

401
00:31:19,477 --> 00:31:22,071
Do what you gotta do, baby.
But listen. Be careful.

402
00:31:22,146 --> 00:31:25,843
Folks around here are not firing on
all cylinders, if you know what I mean.

403
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:27,918
Ka-ching!

404
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:29,078
Ah!

405
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,154
I'll keep that in mind.

406
00:31:31,322 --> 00:31:33,722
- Hey there, Mater.
- Howdy, Sally.

407
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:36,390
- Hi, folks!
- Good morning!

408
00:31:37,128 --> 00:31:38,117
You know her?

409
00:31:38,196 --> 00:31:41,165
She's the town attorney and my fiancée.

410
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,221
What?

411
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:46,396
Nah, I'm just kiddin'.
She just likes me for my body.

412
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:50,305
You look great. You do something
different with your side view mirrors?

413
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:52,036
What do you want, Sally?

414
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:55,477
Come on, make this guy
fix the road. The town needs this.

415
00:31:55,546 --> 00:31:58,709
No. I know his type. Racecar.

416
00:31:58,783 --> 00:32:00,842
That's the last thing this town needs.

417
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:05,413
OK, I didn't want to have to do this,
Doc, but you leave me no choice.

418
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:09,426
Fellow citizens, you're all aware
of our town's proud history.

419
00:32:09,494 --> 00:32:10,927
Here she goes again.

420
00:32:10,995 --> 00:32:13,691
Radiator Springs,
the glorious jewel

421
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:17,394
strung on the necklace
of Route 66, the mother road!

422
00:32:17,468 --> 00:32:21,268
It is our job and our pleasure
to take care of the travelers

423
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:24,331
- on our stretch of that road.
- Travelers? What travelers?

424
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:25,569
Ignore him.

425
00:32:25,643 --> 00:32:29,010
But how, I ask you,
are we to care for those travelers

426
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,412
if there is no road
for them to drive on?

427
00:32:31,482 --> 00:32:34,280
- Luigi, what do you have at your store?
- Tires.

428
00:32:34,352 --> 00:32:35,842
And if no one can get to you?

429
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:40,254
I won't sell any... tires.
I will lose everything!

430
00:32:40,325 --> 00:32:43,158
- Flo, what do you have at your store?
- I have gas.

431
00:32:43,227 --> 00:32:46,628
- Lotsa gas!
- OK boys, stay with me.

432
00:32:46,698 --> 00:32:50,225
And, Flo, what'll happen if no one
can come to your station to buy gas?

433
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:53,793
I'll go outta business and...
we'll have to leave town.

434
00:32:53,871 --> 00:32:56,999
What's gonna happen if Flo
leaves town and closes her station?

435
00:32:57,075 --> 00:32:59,635
- Without gas, we're done for!
- What?

436
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:02,544
Don't you think the car responsible
should fix our road?

437
00:33:02,613 --> 00:33:05,844
The only guy strong enough
to fix that road is Big Al!

438
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:08,147
Lizzie, Big Al left like, 15 years ago.

439
00:33:08,219 --> 00:33:10,244
Then why are you bringing
him up, you lemon?

440
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:11,310
Oh, he can do it.

441
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:14,187
He's got the horsepower.
So, what do you want him to do?

442
00:33:14,258 --> 00:33:15,725
Fix the road!

443
00:33:15,793 --> 00:33:19,354
- Because we are a town worth fixing!
- Yeah!

444
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:23,962
Order in the court!

445
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:27,500
Seems like my mind
has been changed for me.

446
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:29,563
- Yeah!
- No!

447
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,971
Nice ruling.

448
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:35,201
Oh, I am so not taking you to dinner.

449
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:39,147
That's OK, Stickers.
You can take Bessie.

450
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,045
Man, you get to work with Bessie!

451
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:43,747
I'd give my left two lug nuts
for somethin' like that.

452
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:46,483
Bessie? Who's Bessie?

453
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:52,652
This here is Bessie,
finest road-pavin' machine ever built.

454
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:55,790
I'm hereby sentencing you
to community service.

455
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:58,597
You're gonna fix the road
under my supervision.

456
00:33:58,669 --> 00:34:01,001
What? This place is crazy!

457
00:34:01,072 --> 00:34:03,233
I know this may be
a bad time right now,

458
00:34:03,307 --> 00:34:06,299
but you owe me $32,000
in legal fees.

459
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:07,366
What?

460
00:34:07,445 --> 00:34:11,006
We're gonna hitch you up to Bessie,
and you're gonna pull her nice.

461
00:34:11,082 --> 00:34:12,674
You gotta be kidding me.

462
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:15,412
You start there where the road begins.

463
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:18,779
You finish down there
where the road ends.

464
00:34:20,758 --> 00:34:23,022
Holy shoot!

465
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:25,961
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
How long is this gonna take?

466
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:29,591
Well, fella does it right,
should take him about five days.

467
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:30,827
Five days?

468
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:33,837
But I should be in California
schmoozing Dinoco right now!

469
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:36,874
Then if I were you,
I'd quit yappin' and start workin'!

470
00:34:36,941 --> 00:34:39,432
- Hook him up, Mater.
- Okay-dokey.

471
00:34:47,518 --> 00:34:49,748
Freedom!

472
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:58,586
Maybe I should've
hooked him up to Bessie...

473
00:34:59,363 --> 00:35:02,662
...and then...
then took the boot off.

474
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:06,535
Whoo-hoo!

475
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:11,264
Goodbye, Radiator Springs,
and goodbye, Bessie!

476
00:35:11,342 --> 00:35:15,210
California, here I come! Yeah!

477
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:19,573
Oh, feel that wind.

478
00:35:20,017 --> 00:35:21,609
Yes!

479
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:24,812
No. No, no, no.

480
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,421
No, no, no, no, no. Outta gas?

481
00:35:27,492 --> 00:35:29,483
How can I be outta gas?

482
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:33,519
Boy, we ain't
as dumb as you think we are.

483
00:35:33,598 --> 00:35:35,930
But how did,
how did... you...?

484
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,332
We siphoned your gas
while you were passed out.

485
00:35:38,402 --> 00:35:41,303
- Ka-chow.
- Ow, ow, ow, ow.

486
00:35:49,714 --> 00:35:52,114
- Gentlemen.
- Sheriff.

487
00:35:52,183 --> 00:35:53,275
Hey, Sheriff.

488
00:35:53,351 --> 00:35:55,615
<i>- Why here?
- Sono sempre stati qui.</i>

489
00:35:55,686 --> 00:35:58,177
<i>- They were better before.
- Stai sempre a parlare.</i>

490
00:35:58,256 --> 00:36:00,121
- Guido!
- Red, can you move over?

491
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:03,024
I want to get a look
at that sexy hot rod.

492
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:05,927
You know, I used to be
a purty good whistler.

493
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:08,727
I can't do it now, of course,
on account of sometimes

494
00:36:08,799 --> 00:36:11,700
I get fluid built up
in my engine block,

495
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:15,136
but Doc said he's gonna fix it.
He can fix about anything.

496
00:36:15,206 --> 00:36:17,436
That's why we made him the judge.

497
00:36:17,608 --> 00:36:21,772
<i>Boy, you shoulda heard me on
Giddy-up, Oom Papa Mow Mow.</i>

498
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,211
Now, I'm not one to brag

499
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:26,580
but people come purty far
to see me get low on the "Mow-Mow".

500
00:36:27,051 --> 00:36:28,075
Oh!

501
00:36:28,152 --> 00:36:30,985
- Aw, man, that's just great!
- Hey, what's wrong?

502
00:36:31,055 --> 00:36:32,852
My lucky sticker's all dirty.

503
00:36:32,924 --> 00:36:35,188
Ah, that ain't nothin'.
I'll clean it for ya.

504
00:36:35,259 --> 00:36:39,958
No, no, no!

505
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:42,363
That won't be necessary.

506
00:36:43,434 --> 00:36:46,733
Hey! Hey, big fella!
Yeah, you in the red!

507
00:36:46,804 --> 00:36:49,432
I could use a little hose down.
Help me wash this off.

508
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:52,865
Where's he goin'?

509
00:36:52,944 --> 00:36:56,380
Oh, he's a little bit shy, and
he hates you for killin' his flowers.

510
00:36:56,447 --> 00:36:57,971
I shouldn't put up with this.

511
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:00,916
I'm a precision instrument
of speed and aerodynamics.

512
00:37:00,985 --> 00:37:04,011
- You hurt your what?
- I'm a very famous racecar!

513
00:37:04,288 --> 00:37:07,485
You are a famous racecar?
A real racecar?

514
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:10,186
Yes, I'm a real racecar.
What do you think? Look at me.

515
00:37:10,261 --> 00:37:14,254
I have followed racing my entire life.
My whole life!

516
00:37:14,332 --> 00:37:16,630
Then you know who I am.
I'm Lightning McQueen.

517
00:37:16,701 --> 00:37:18,794
- Lightning McQueen?
- Yes! Yes!

518
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:20,860
I must scream it to the world!

519
00:37:20,938 --> 00:37:25,170
My excitement from the top
of someplace very high!

520
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:27,734
- Do you know many Ferraris?
- No, no, no, no, no.

521
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:30,781
They race on the European circuit.
I'm in the Piston Cup!

522
00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:34,484
- What?
- Luigi follow only the Ferraris.

523
00:37:39,357 --> 00:37:41,917
Is that what I think it is?

524
00:37:43,494 --> 00:37:44,756
Customers.

525
00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:48,287
Customers!
Customers, everyone! Customers!

526
00:37:48,366 --> 00:37:49,731
- OK!
- Customers?

527
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,633
Been a long time.
Remember what we rehearsed.

528
00:37:52,703 --> 00:37:55,263
Make sure your
"Open, please come in" signs are out.

529
00:37:55,339 --> 00:37:58,866
You all know what to do.
All right, nobody panics. Here we go!

530
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:01,605
Van, I just don't see
any on-ramp anywhere.

531
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:06,082
- Minny, I know exactly where we are.
- Yeah, we're in the middle of nowhere.

532
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:08,812
- Honey, please.
- Hello.

533
00:38:08,886 --> 00:38:11,855
Welcome to Radiator Springs,
gateway to Ornament Valley.

534
00:38:11,922 --> 00:38:14,186
Legendary for
its service and hospitality.

535
00:38:14,258 --> 00:38:15,282
How can we help you?

536
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:19,420
- We don't need anything, thank you.
- Ask for directions to the Interstate.

537
00:38:19,497 --> 00:38:22,728
There's no need to ask for directions.
I know where we're going.

538
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,234
He did the same thing
on our trip to Shakopee.

539
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:28,136
We were headed over there
for the Crazy Days, and we...

540
00:38:28,205 --> 00:38:31,265
- OK. Really. We're just peachy, OK?
- What you really need

541
00:38:31,342 --> 00:38:35,403
is the sweet taste
of my homemade, organic fuel.

542
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:37,174
No, it doesn't agree with my tank.

543
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:40,445
- Just trying to find the Interstate.
- Good to see you, soldier!

544
00:38:40,518 --> 00:38:43,851
Come on by Sarge's Surplus Hut
for your government surplus needs.

545
00:38:43,921 --> 00:38:46,253
- Honey, surplus!
- We have too much surplus.

546
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:48,656
I do have a map
over at the Cozy Cone Motel.

547
00:38:48,726 --> 00:38:51,889
And if you stay, we offer a free
Lincoln Continental breakfast.

548
00:38:51,962 --> 00:38:55,693
- Honey, she's got a map.
- I don't need a map! I have the GPS.

549
00:38:55,766 --> 00:38:59,224
- Never need a map again, thank you.
- How 'bout somethin' to drink?

550
00:38:59,303 --> 00:39:03,239
Stop at Flo's V-Eight Café.
Finest fuel on Route 66.

551
00:39:03,307 --> 00:39:04,467
No we just topped off.

552
00:39:04,542 --> 00:39:08,410
And if you need tires,
stop by Luigi's Casa Della Tires,

553
00:39:08,479 --> 00:39:10,947
home of the Leaning Tower of Tires.

554
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:14,348
- We're trying to find the Interstate.
- But you do need a paint job.

555
00:39:14,418 --> 00:39:17,581
Ramone will paint you up right.
Hey, anything you want!

556
00:39:17,655 --> 00:39:19,953
- You know, like a flame job.
- No thanks...

557
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:21,355
Maybe ghost flames!

558
00:39:21,425 --> 00:39:23,985
You like old school pinstripin'?
Von Dutch style?

559
00:39:24,061 --> 00:39:27,963
Oh, honey, look. Von Dutch.

560
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:31,058
OK, no.
We're gonna be going now, OK?

561
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:32,625
Ow!

562
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:35,900
A little somethin'
to remember us by, OK?

563
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:38,233
- OK!
- Come back soon, OK?

564
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:41,801
I mean, you know where we are!
Tell your friends!

565
00:39:43,414 --> 00:39:45,473
OK! Yes. You bet.

566
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:47,813
Thanks again, folks.
Bye-bye now.

567
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:50,979
Psst! Psst!
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

568
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:53,216
- I know how to get to the Interstate!
- Do ya?

569
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:55,952
- Minny, no.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

570
00:39:56,026 --> 00:39:57,493
No, not really. But listen.

571
00:39:57,561 --> 00:40:01,190
I'm Lightning McQueen, famous racecar.
I'm being held against my will.

572
00:40:01,265 --> 00:40:03,790
I need you to call my team,
so they can come rescue me

573
00:40:03,868 --> 00:40:07,702
and get me to California in time for me
to win the Piston Cup. Understand?

574
00:40:08,672 --> 00:40:10,936
<i>No, no, no, no, no, no, no.</i>

575
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:14,876
No, it's the truth! I'm telling you!
You gotta help me! Don't leave me here!

576
00:40:14,945 --> 00:40:18,108
I'm in hillbilly hell!
My IQ's dropping by the second!

577
00:40:18,182 --> 00:40:20,275
I'm becoming one of them!

578
00:40:22,153 --> 00:40:24,280
OK, don't worry.
They know where we are now.

579
00:40:24,355 --> 00:40:26,118
They'll tell friends. You'll see.

580
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:29,057
<i>We'll be back
for our Hank Williams marathon...</i>

581
00:40:29,126 --> 00:40:31,856
<i>- That's good.
- ... after a Piston Cup update.</i>

582
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:35,831
<i>Still no sign of Lightning
McQueen. Chick arrived in California</i>

583
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:39,358
<i>and today became the first car
to spend practice time on the track.</i>

584
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:42,600
<i>It's nice to get out here
before the other competitors.</i>

585
00:40:42,673 --> 00:40:46,439
<i>You know, get a head start.
Gives me an edge.</i>

586
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,677
Hoo-hoo-hoo!

587
00:40:56,754 --> 00:40:57,743
Ha-ha!

588
00:41:01,592 --> 00:41:02,581
Yeah!

589
00:41:14,205 --> 00:41:16,537
Hey, McQueen...
Eat your heart out.

590
00:41:17,007 --> 00:41:18,838
Oh!

591
00:41:18,909 --> 00:41:20,274
Let me get this straight.

592
00:41:20,344 --> 00:41:23,279
I can go when this road is done.
That's the deal, right?

593
00:41:23,347 --> 00:41:27,078
- That's what they done did said.
- OK. Outta my way.

594
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:28,243
I got a road to finish.

595
00:41:40,097 --> 00:41:42,497
- He's done!
- Done?

596
00:41:42,566 --> 00:41:44,932
- Uh-huh.
- It's only been an hour.

597
00:41:46,871 --> 00:41:50,204
Ah, I'm done. Look, I'm finished.

598
00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:53,141
Say thanks, and I'll be on my way.
That's all you gotta say.

599
00:41:53,744 --> 00:41:57,407
Whee-hoo!
I'm the first one on the new road!

600
00:41:57,982 --> 00:41:59,574
Oh!

601
00:42:00,918 --> 00:42:03,614
It rides purty smooth.

602
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:07,312
- It looks awful!
- Well, it matches the rest of the town.

603
00:42:07,424 --> 00:42:10,916
Oh!

604
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:13,286
Red.

605
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,231
Who do you think you are?

606
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:20,600
Look, Doc said when I finish,
I could go. That was the deal.

607
00:42:20,671 --> 00:42:24,107
The deal was you fix the road,
not make it worse.

608
00:42:24,174 --> 00:42:26,642
Now, scrape it off!
Start over again.

609
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:30,339
Hey, look, grandpa,
I'm not a bulldozer. I'm a racecar.

610
00:42:30,414 --> 00:42:31,904
Oh-ho-ho-ho!

611
00:42:31,982 --> 00:42:36,214
Is that right? Then why don't we
just have a little race? Me and you.

612
00:42:36,287 --> 00:42:40,087
- What?
- Me and you. That a joke?

613
00:42:40,157 --> 00:42:42,523
If you win, you go and I fix the road.

614
00:42:42,593 --> 00:42:45,289
If I win, you do the road my way.

615
00:42:45,362 --> 00:42:46,886
Doc, what're you doin'?

616
00:42:47,264 --> 00:42:49,095
I don't mean to be rude here,

617
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:52,897
but you probably go zero to sixty in,
like, what? Three-point-five years?

618
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:55,495
Then I reckon
you ain't got nothin' to worry about.

619
00:42:55,573 --> 00:43:00,237
You know what, old-timer?
That's a wonderful idea. Let's race.

620
00:43:01,979 --> 00:43:04,504
Gentlemen,
this will be a one-lap race.

621
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:09,076
You will drive to Willy's Butte,
go around Willy's Butte and come back.

622
00:43:09,153 --> 00:43:12,088
There will be no bumpin',
no cheatin', no spittin',

623
00:43:12,156 --> 00:43:14,681
no bitin', no road rage, no maimin',

624
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:19,889
no oil slickin', no pushin', no shovin',
no backstabbin', no road-hoggin',

625
00:43:19,964 --> 00:43:21,727
and no lollygaggin'.

626
00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:23,357
Speed. I'm speed.

627
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:25,994
Float like a Cadillac,
sting like a Beemer.

628
00:43:27,237 --> 00:43:32,038
My friend Guido, he dream to give
a real racecar a pit stop.

629
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:34,634
- Peet stop!
- Uh...

630
00:43:34,712 --> 00:43:37,579
The race is only one lap, guys.

631
00:43:37,648 --> 00:43:40,139
<i>Uno lappo! Don't need any help.</i>

632
00:43:40,217 --> 00:43:44,051
<i>- I work solo mio.
- Fine. Race your way.</i>

633
00:43:45,356 --> 00:43:49,224
- No pit stoppo. Comprendo?
- OK.

634
00:43:49,326 --> 00:43:51,317
Gentlemen...

635
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:54,795
...start your engines!

636
00:44:01,572 --> 00:44:03,938
<i>- Hijole! Check that out!
- Whoa.</i>

637
00:44:04,008 --> 00:44:07,102
Great idea, Doc.
Now the road will never get done.

638
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:08,775
Luigi?

639
00:44:08,846 --> 00:44:12,043
On your mark, get set...

640
00:44:12,116 --> 00:44:14,346
<i>Uno for the money,
due for the show,</i>

641
00:44:14,418 --> 00:44:20,118
<i>tre to get ready, and quattro
to... I can't believe it. Go!</i>

642
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:29,930
Huh?

643
00:44:30,567 --> 00:44:33,092
Doc... the flag means go.

644
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:36,503
Remember the fl...
Here we go. Go.

645
00:44:36,573 --> 00:44:39,303
Doc, what are you doing, man?

646
00:44:39,376 --> 00:44:42,937
Oh, dear. It would seem
I'm off to a poor start.

647
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:46,141
Well, better late than never.
Come on, Mater.

648
00:44:46,216 --> 00:44:48,980
- Might need a little help.
- Uh... OK.

649
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:52,121
You got your tow cable?

650
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:54,384
Well, yeah,
I always got my tow cable. Why?

651
00:44:54,458 --> 00:44:56,756
Oh, just in case.

652
00:45:05,302 --> 00:45:07,497
Ow! Ow!
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

653
00:45:07,571 --> 00:45:09,300
No, no, no, no, no!

654
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,840
- Oh, man!
- Whoa.

655
00:45:12,576 --> 00:45:14,874
- Ow!
- Bad trip, man.

656
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:24,044
Hey! Was that floatin' like a Cadillac
or was that stingin' like a Beemer?

657
00:45:24,121 --> 00:45:26,487
I'm confused.

658
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:28,650
You drive like you fix roads.

659
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:31,923
Lousy! Have fun fishin', Mater.

660
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:37,564
Ah!

661
00:45:38,302 --> 00:45:41,271
I'm startin' to think he knowed
you was gonna crash!

662
00:45:41,338 --> 00:45:44,466
Thank you, Mater. Thank you.

663
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:49,512
I can make a little turn on dirt.

664
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,013
You think?

665
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:55,541
No. And now I'm a day behind.
I'm never gonna get outta here!

666
00:45:55,619 --> 00:45:58,087
<i>Hey, ése!
You need a new paint job, man!</i>

667
00:45:58,155 --> 00:46:01,124
- No, thank you.
- How 'bout some organic fuel?

668
00:46:01,191 --> 00:46:03,557
- That freak juice?
- Pass.

669
00:46:03,627 --> 00:46:08,087
Whoo! Watchin' him is makin' me thirsty.
Anybody else want somethin' to drink?

670
00:46:08,165 --> 00:46:09,757
Nah, not me, Flo.

671
00:46:09,833 --> 00:46:12,301
I'm on one of them there special diets.

672
00:46:12,369 --> 00:46:16,965
I'm a precisional instrument
of speed and aero-matics.

673
00:46:17,541 --> 00:46:19,805
"You race like you fix roads. "

674
00:46:19,877 --> 00:46:24,644
I'll show him.
I will show him!

675
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:37,324
Oh, great! I hate it!

676
00:46:37,394 --> 00:46:41,023
- Hate, hate, hate, hate it!
- Music. Sweet music.

677
00:46:42,232 --> 00:46:44,792
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.

678
00:46:44,868 --> 00:46:47,598
Radiator Springs, a happy place!

679
00:46:47,671 --> 00:46:50,697
OK, Bessie, you think that's funny?

680
00:46:53,243 --> 00:46:57,043
Great! I'm talking to Bessie now!
I'm talking to Bessie!

681
00:47:10,093 --> 00:47:11,151
Wow.

682
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:13,190
Mornin', Sally!

683
00:47:13,263 --> 00:47:18,462
Hey, look at this here fancy new road
that Lightnin' McQueen done just made!

684
00:47:18,535 --> 00:47:20,560
Yes! Uh, amazing!

685
00:47:21,038 --> 00:47:24,667
Whoa-ho! Yeah!

686
00:47:24,741 --> 00:47:28,939
Oh, Ramone! Mama ain't
seen you that low in years.

687
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:31,572
I haven't seen a road like this
in years.

688
00:47:31,648 --> 00:47:35,778
- Well, then let's cruise, baby.
- Low and slow.

689
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:38,048
<i>E bellissima! It's beautiful!</i>

690
00:47:38,121 --> 00:47:41,852
Guido, look, it's-a like
it was paved by angels.

691
00:47:42,793 --> 00:47:44,090
Boy, I tell you what.

692
00:47:44,161 --> 00:47:46,994
I bet even the roads on the moon
ain't this smooth.

693
00:47:47,064 --> 00:47:48,725
Doc, look at this!

694
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:51,733
Shoulda tossed him into
the cactus a lot sooner, huh?

695
00:47:51,802 --> 00:47:55,294
Well, he ain't finished yet.
Still got a long way to go.

696
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:58,341
Guido, look at Luigi!

697
00:47:58,942 --> 00:48:00,671
<i>This is fantastico!</i>

698
00:48:00,744 --> 00:48:04,202
That looks like fun!
Mater, I got dibs, next turn!

699
00:48:04,281 --> 00:48:08,581
Hey, Luigi, this new road
makes your place look like a dump.

700
00:48:09,253 --> 00:48:11,949
That crazy old devil woman.

701
00:48:12,422 --> 00:48:15,823
Oh!

702
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:17,724
She's right!

703
00:48:17,794 --> 00:48:19,352
- Ah!
- Guido!

704
00:48:19,429 --> 00:48:23,195
Huh. That punk actually did a good job.

705
00:48:24,468 --> 00:48:28,268
Well, now... where the heck is he?

706
00:48:34,611 --> 00:48:37,341
Sheriff!
Is he makin' another run for it?

707
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:40,781
No, no. He ran outta asphalt
in the middle of the night,

708
00:48:40,851 --> 00:48:43,217
and asked me if he could
come down here.

709
00:48:43,287 --> 00:48:45,687
All he's tryin' to do
is make that there turn.

710
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:48,589
No, no, no, no! Oh, great.

711
00:48:49,059 --> 00:48:51,584
Perfect turns on every track
I've ever raced on.

712
00:48:53,797 --> 00:48:57,756
Sheriff, why don't you go get yourself
a quart of oil at Flo's.

713
00:48:57,834 --> 00:48:59,233
I'll keep an eye on him.

714
00:48:59,303 --> 00:49:03,205
Well, thanks, Doc.
I've been feelin' a quart low.

715
00:49:17,587 --> 00:49:20,055
This ain't asphalt, son. This is dirt.

716
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:22,853
Oh, great. What do you want?
You here to gloat?

717
00:49:22,926 --> 00:49:26,259
You don't have three-wheel brakes,
so you got to pitch it hard,

718
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:29,822
break it loose and then
just drive it with the throttle.

719
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:32,960
Give it too much, you'll be
outta the dirt and into the tulips.

720
00:49:33,036 --> 00:49:36,130
So you're a judge,
a doctor and a racing expert.

721
00:49:36,206 --> 00:49:37,867
I'll put it simple.

722
00:49:37,941 --> 00:49:42,105
If you're goin' hard enough left,
you'll find yourself turnin' right.

723
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:48,584
Oh... Right. That makes perfect sense.
Turn right to go left! Yes! Thank you!

724
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:50,449
Or should I say, "No, thank you"?

725
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:54,115
Because in Opposite World,
maybe that really means, "Thank you"!

726
00:49:56,927 --> 00:50:00,328
Crazy grandpa car. What an idiot!

727
00:50:07,971 --> 00:50:09,905
Turn right to go left.

728
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:13,165
Hmm...

729
00:50:13,243 --> 00:50:14,301
Whoa!

730
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:18,113
Oh!

731
00:50:18,582 --> 00:50:22,541
Ow! Oh, that...

732
00:50:24,121 --> 00:50:27,488
Ow!

733
00:50:28,925 --> 00:50:32,190
Turn right to go left.
Guess what. I tried it.

734
00:50:32,262 --> 00:50:35,356
You know what? This crazy thing
happened... I went right!

735
00:50:35,432 --> 00:50:38,833
You keep talkin' to yourself,
people'll think you're crazy.

736
00:50:38,902 --> 00:50:42,838
- Thanks for the tip.
- What? I wasn't talkin' to you!

737
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:53,274
<i>- Oh, Guido, e bellissimo!
- Che cosa?</i>

738
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:57,719
<i>- It looks great! This is great!
- Ti piace, eh? Si, si, bellissimo.</i>

739
00:51:00,323 --> 00:51:02,314
Oh, Lord.

740
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:04,019
Mater!

741
00:51:04,094 --> 00:51:06,255
I need you
to watch the prisoner tonight.

742
00:51:06,329 --> 00:51:09,628
Well, dad-gum! Wait a minute.
What if he tries to run again?

743
00:51:09,699 --> 00:51:12,532
Just let him run outta gas
and tow him on back.

744
00:51:12,602 --> 00:51:15,070
- But keep an eye on him.
- Yes, sir!

745
00:51:16,173 --> 00:51:17,834
Oh...

746
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:20,570
While I'm stuck here
paving this stinkin' road,

747
00:51:20,644 --> 00:51:23,204
Chick's in California schmoozing Dinoco.

748
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:26,545
My Dinoco. Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Who's touching me?

749
00:51:26,616 --> 00:51:28,914
You have a slow leak. Guido, he fix.

750
00:51:28,985 --> 00:51:31,010
You make-a such a nice new road.

751
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:33,750
You come to my shop.
Luigi take-a good care of you.

752
00:51:33,824 --> 00:51:35,416
Even though you not a Ferrari.

753
00:51:35,492 --> 00:51:39,588
You buy four tires,
I give you a full-a size spare

754
00:51:39,663 --> 00:51:43,531
- absolutely free!
- Look, I get all my tires for free.

755
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:47,127
I like your style, eh?

756
00:51:47,204 --> 00:51:50,765
You drive the hard bargain.
OK. Luigi make you a new deal.

757
00:51:50,841 --> 00:51:54,299
You buy one tire,
I give you three for free!

758
00:51:54,377 --> 00:51:56,038
Oh, would you look at that?

759
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:58,240
Ramone, Ramone!

760
00:51:58,315 --> 00:52:00,408
Then Luigi make you
a new new deal.

761
00:52:00,484 --> 00:52:03,476
No, no, no, no.
Deal me out. Pass. No, thank you.

762
00:52:03,553 --> 00:52:07,182
- No, no, no, no. No.
- This is it. My last offer.

763
00:52:07,257 --> 00:52:11,956
You buy one tire, I give you
seven-a snow tires for free!

764
00:52:12,028 --> 00:52:14,895
Done. You interested, you call me.
You know where I am.

765
00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:17,459
Ah!

766
00:52:17,534 --> 00:52:19,661
Stop! Let me...

767
00:52:21,071 --> 00:52:23,904
Oh, Red, you missed a spot.
See it right there?

768
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:25,999
- No! No!
- On the hood right there.

769
00:52:26,076 --> 00:52:29,409
Stop, stop! That's cold!

770
00:52:29,479 --> 00:52:31,970
Help! Please! Stop!

771
00:52:32,048 --> 00:52:35,415
Thanks, Red.

772
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:37,915
What was that for?

773
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:40,115
- Do you want to stay at the Cozy Cone?
- Huh?

774
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:41,680
If you do, you gotta be clean.

775
00:52:41,758 --> 00:52:44,283
'Cause even in hillbilly hell
we have standards.

776
00:52:44,361 --> 00:52:46,090
What, I...? I don't get it.

777
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:48,757
I thought I'd say thank you
for doin' a great job.

778
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:52,063
So I thought I'd let you stay with me.
I mean, not with me!

779
00:52:52,135 --> 00:52:56,765
But there. Not with me there,
but there in your own cozy cone.

780
00:52:56,840 --> 00:53:00,708
- And I'd be in my cone, and it's...
- Wait. Wait, you're being nice to me.

781
00:53:00,777 --> 00:53:03,177
If you want to stay
at the dirty impound, fine.

782
00:53:03,246 --> 00:53:06,511
- I understand you criminal types.
- No, no, no, no. That's OK.

783
00:53:06,583 --> 00:53:09,780
- Yeah, the Cozy Cone.
- It's newly refurbished.

784
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:13,311
Yeah,
it's like a clever little twist.

785
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:17,520
The motel's made out of caution cones,
which, of course, cars try to avoid.

786
00:53:17,594 --> 00:53:20,961
But now we're gonna stay in them.
That's funny.

787
00:53:22,465 --> 00:53:24,695
Figure that all out on your own,
did you?

788
00:53:25,669 --> 00:53:28,137
Cone number one, if you want.

789
00:53:29,239 --> 00:53:31,605
Oh...

790
00:53:32,742 --> 00:53:36,473
Hey, do I spy a little
pinstriping tattoo back there?

791
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:39,640
Oh...
That's just a... Oh!

792
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:45,552
Oh, you saw that? Yeah.
Just gonna be going.

793
00:53:45,622 --> 00:53:48,250
Gonna... Yeah.

794
00:53:52,996 --> 00:53:55,590
You know, I knew this girl Doreen.

795
00:53:55,665 --> 00:53:57,155
Good-lookin' girl.

796
00:53:57,234 --> 00:54:00,533
Looked just like a Jaguar,
only she was a truck!

797
00:54:00,604 --> 00:54:04,096
You know, I used to crash into her,
just so I could spoke to her.

798
00:54:05,208 --> 00:54:07,676
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know.

799
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:11,874
Hey, I know somethin' we can do tonight,
'cause I'm in charge of watchin' you!

800
00:54:11,948 --> 00:54:16,112
No, Mater, I gotta finish this road,
and I have to get out of here.

801
00:54:16,186 --> 00:54:19,747
Well, that's all right,
Mr. I Can't Turn On Dirt.

802
00:54:19,823 --> 00:54:22,121
You probably couldn't handle it anyway.

803
00:54:22,192 --> 00:54:23,955
Whoa, whoa, easy now, Mater.

804
00:54:24,027 --> 00:54:27,019
You know who you're talkin' to?
This is Lightning McQueen.

805
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:29,429
I can handle anything.

806
00:54:29,499 --> 00:54:34,334
- I'm not doin' this.
- Come on. You'll love it!

807
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:38,131
- Tractor-tippin's fun.
- This is ridiculous.

808
00:54:38,208 --> 00:54:40,642
All right, listen.

809
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:44,703
When I say go, we go.
But don't let Frank catch you. Go!

810
00:54:44,781 --> 00:54:46,612
Whoa! Wait! Who's Frank?

811
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:49,585
Mater!

812
00:54:49,653 --> 00:54:51,086
Wait, Mater!

813
00:54:52,856 --> 00:54:54,221
OK, here's what you do.

814
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:57,692
You just sneak up in front of 'em,
and then honk.

815
00:54:57,761 --> 00:55:00,252
And they do the rest. Watch this.

816
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:09,135
Oh!

817
00:55:09,205 --> 00:55:14,404
Oh... Oh! Oh...

818
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:24,446
I swear, tractors is so dumb!

819
00:55:24,521 --> 00:55:28,321
I tell you what, buddy,
it don't get much better than this.

820
00:55:28,391 --> 00:55:30,985
Yep, you're livin' the dream, Mater boy.

821
00:55:33,963 --> 00:55:36,557
Oh!

822
00:55:36,633 --> 00:55:40,228
Oh! Oh...

823
00:55:43,273 --> 00:55:47,266
I don't care who you are,
that's funny right there.

824
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:49,107
Oh, your turn, bud.

825
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:51,579
Mater, I can't.
I don't even have a horn.

826
00:55:51,648 --> 00:55:53,878
- Baby.
- I'm not a baby.

827
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:58,419
Fine. Stop! Stop, OK?
All right. I'll do something.
