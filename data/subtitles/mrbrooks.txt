1
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:52,774
<i>Oh, God...</i>

2
00:00:53,686 --> 00:00:56,917
<i>God, grant me the serenity to
accept the things I cannot change...</i>

3
00:00:57,022 --> 00:00:59,616
<i>Why do you fight it so hard,
Earl?</i>

4
00:01:00,092 --> 00:01:02,083
<i>The courage to change the things
that I can...</i>

5
00:01:02,194 --> 00:01:05,630
<i>Come on.
You've been a good boy for a long time.</i>

6
00:01:06,065 --> 00:01:07,726
<i>You know you want to do this.</i>

7
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:09,858
<i>And wisdom...</i>

8
00:01:10,836 --> 00:01:13,498
<i>Wisdom to know the difference.</i>

9
00:01:21,847 --> 00:01:25,806
<i>Taking, as He did, this sinful world
as it is, not as I would have it.</i>

10
00:01:25,918 --> 00:01:29,149
<i>Trusting that He will make all things
right if I surrender to His will,</i>

11
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:32,053
<i>that I may be reasonably happy in this life</i>

12
00:01:32,157 --> 00:01:35,320
<i>and supremely happy with Him
forever in the next.</i>

13
00:01:35,427 --> 00:01:36,519
<i>Amen.</i>

14
00:01:37,396 --> 00:01:40,695
I could go on and on
about what a great guy Earl is,

15
00:01:41,066 --> 00:01:43,899
how he gives so freely of his time
and his money,

16
00:01:44,536 --> 00:01:46,026
even how he...

17
00:01:46,872 --> 00:01:49,033
Well, even how he cuts his toenails.

18
00:01:52,511 --> 00:01:55,139
Let's get Earl up here to speak for himself.

19
00:01:55,247 --> 00:01:58,114
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you a businessman,

20
00:01:58,417 --> 00:01:59,782
philanthropist,

21
00:01:59,885 --> 00:02:01,375
a very dear friend,

22
00:02:01,687 --> 00:02:04,622
and the Portland Chamber of Commerce
Man of the Year,

23
00:02:04,723 --> 00:02:05,883
Mr. Earl Brooks!

24
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:15,494
Thank you all very much.

25
00:02:18,804 --> 00:02:20,738
The first thing I would like
to say is that I...

26
00:02:23,142 --> 00:02:25,702
I don't even know how I cut my toenails.

27
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:32,213
Twenty years ago,

28
00:02:32,718 --> 00:02:36,848
when I started the Brooks Box Factories,
I never dreamed I would...

29
00:02:45,297 --> 00:02:48,198
I never dreamed
that I would one day be standing here.

30
00:02:58,844 --> 00:03:01,642
Did you see Sis Wallace's dress?

31
00:03:03,215 --> 00:03:06,275
You could see her nipples.
At her age. Wow.

32
00:03:06,385 --> 00:03:09,115
She's got to keep those things hidden.

33
00:03:10,122 --> 00:03:12,818
The only thing that would have made
this evening more perfect

34
00:03:12,925 --> 00:03:14,893
is if Jane had been here.

35
00:03:16,428 --> 00:03:19,295
Emma, she called
to congratulate me, all right?

36
00:03:19,398 --> 00:03:21,730
She has midterms coming up.

37
00:03:22,835 --> 00:03:24,928
I think she's dropping out.

38
00:03:25,704 --> 00:03:27,035
We'll see.

39
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:30,871
Nothing she does is wrong to you, is it?

40
00:03:33,712 --> 00:03:36,203
Well, she missed a good party.

41
00:03:43,956 --> 00:03:46,447
It's not like it's not set up.

42
00:03:48,527 --> 00:03:51,758
You already know
how to bypass the alarms.

43
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:55,259
- You know how to pick the locks.
- No.

44
00:03:56,502 --> 00:03:59,130
You're the fucking Man of the Year.

45
00:03:59,471 --> 00:04:00,699
You deserve a treat.

46
00:04:00,839 --> 00:04:02,136
No, Marshall. I said no.

47
00:04:02,574 --> 00:04:04,235
Well, I heard you.

48
00:04:05,144 --> 00:04:07,271
But you don't mean no.

49
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:12,611
What's wrong?

50
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:14,886
Nothing.

51
00:04:17,956 --> 00:04:19,548
You're frowning.

52
00:04:19,925 --> 00:04:23,224
I'm thinking about
what I didn't say in the speech.

53
00:04:23,996 --> 00:04:25,156
Honey.

54
00:04:25,831 --> 00:04:28,322
It was so moving.

55
00:04:29,134 --> 00:04:30,999
You made us all laugh.

56
00:04:31,637 --> 00:04:34,162
I don't think anybody felt left out.

57
00:04:38,577 --> 00:04:41,102
They have their dance class tonight.

58
00:04:42,781 --> 00:04:46,945
We could just drive by and look at them.

59
00:04:47,052 --> 00:04:49,680
There's no harm in just having a look.

60
00:04:50,689 --> 00:04:53,157
- No means no, Marshall.
- Please.

61
00:04:53,992 --> 00:04:55,459
Pretty please.

62
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:12,408
I thought the food tonight was very good,
but I was not crazy about the dessert.

63
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:17,042
Would you like to stop somewhere and
get something sweet?

64
00:05:17,316 --> 00:05:18,442
Okay.

65
00:05:23,689 --> 00:05:26,157
I know that I don't want a small dog.

66
00:05:26,258 --> 00:05:28,385
Labradors are supposed to be great.

67
00:05:28,527 --> 00:05:30,859
The Voltes have
always had golden retrievers.

68
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:32,828
They're very happy with them.

69
00:05:36,702 --> 00:05:39,296
There's an Irish Lab that I read about.

70
00:05:39,404 --> 00:05:42,840
It's a little smaller in build
and still as playful.

71
00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:47,467
Standard poodles.
People are very happy with them.

72
00:05:47,913 --> 00:05:50,905
But maybe a rescue mutt.
What do you think?

73
00:06:09,801 --> 00:06:12,895
Don't let me do this.
Don't let me do this, please.

74
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:15,132
I don't want to start again.

75
00:06:15,941 --> 00:06:20,105
You promised, Earl.
You promised. Please. Please.

76
00:06:20,679 --> 00:06:23,807
<i>Why do you fight it so hard, Earl?</i>

77
00:06:43,735 --> 00:06:45,965
I'm going to stay up awhile,

78
00:06:46,738 --> 00:06:49,901
maybe go to the studio
and play with some glazes.

79
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:52,468
Okay.

80
00:06:53,178 --> 00:06:54,907
I'm going to read.

81
00:06:55,013 --> 00:06:58,039
If I'm not awake,
wake me when you come back.

82
00:07:07,459 --> 00:07:08,926
By the way,

83
00:07:09,561 --> 00:07:12,758
I thought you were wonderful tonight,
Mrs. Brooks.

84
00:07:13,398 --> 00:07:15,298
Thank you, Mr. Brooks.

85
00:08:30,108 --> 00:08:34,807
Oh, lordy, Earl my boy, I have missed this.
We are going to have so much fun.

86
00:08:34,913 --> 00:08:39,350
This is the last time, Marshall.
Understand me. It's the very last time.

87
00:09:41,546 --> 00:09:44,037
Don't you dare quit on me,
you piece of shit.

88
00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:46,549
I want to see what they're doing.

89
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:41,999
Hello.

90
00:10:44,576 --> 00:10:45,873
Be quiet.

91
00:10:46,344 --> 00:10:47,538
Sit up.

92
00:11:24,883 --> 00:11:26,214
Whoa, Earl.

93
00:11:35,193 --> 00:11:37,024
What the fuck is this?

94
00:11:39,564 --> 00:11:43,000
These fucking pigs like to do it with
the curtains open.

95
00:11:43,401 --> 00:11:47,360
You should have known that.
This is a big mistake for you, Earl.

96
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:52,102
Almost like I want to get caught,
huh, Marshall?

97
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:55,077
Well, don't fucking do that.

98
00:11:56,781 --> 00:11:58,373
I don't think either of us would enjoy

99
00:11:58,483 --> 00:12:02,214
spending the rest of our lives
on death row, or a lethal injection.

100
00:12:05,323 --> 00:12:06,984
Yes, sir.

101
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,972
Oh, God, forgive me. Forgive me.

102
00:13:02,347 --> 00:13:03,837
Please forgive me.

103
00:13:06,518 --> 00:13:08,543
Please forgive me. Please.

104
00:13:08,653 --> 00:13:10,314
Please forgive me.

105
00:13:11,456 --> 00:13:13,549
Oh, God, please forgive me.

106
00:13:17,128 --> 00:13:20,325
You're a fucking artist, Earl.
I'll give you that.

107
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,665
Don't even think about it.

108
00:13:31,109 --> 00:13:32,838
You know the rules.

109
00:13:57,002 --> 00:14:00,369
Now go upstairs
and make love to your beautiful wife.

110
00:14:18,356 --> 00:14:20,551
Can we have the room, please?

111
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,891
Thank you.

112
00:14:27,298 --> 00:14:29,892
There's your thumbprint, right there.

113
00:14:30,702 --> 00:14:33,603
- One his, one hers?
- That's what it looks like.

114
00:14:33,705 --> 00:14:36,367
This guy hasn't been active
for over two years.

115
00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:41,169
He always rearranges the bodies,
but this is way out of character.

116
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,447
Usually, it's much more romantic,

117
00:14:45,016 --> 00:14:47,576
arms around each other, kissing,

118
00:14:48,219 --> 00:14:50,449
mouths open, tongues touching.

119
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:53,157
The bullets went straight
through the victims.

120
00:14:53,258 --> 00:14:55,556
The killer recovered the slugs.

121
00:15:01,499 --> 00:15:04,024
Were these open or closed
when you got here?

122
00:15:04,135 --> 00:15:05,329
Closed.

123
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:08,039
Hmm.

124
00:15:11,209 --> 00:15:13,177
Could be the work of a copycat.

125
00:15:14,212 --> 00:15:18,740
No, it's never been revealed to the public
that the killer retrieves his slugs.

126
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:20,943
Jesus. I was hoping
this guy was either dead

127
00:15:21,052 --> 00:15:22,815
or in jail on some other charge.

128
00:15:27,659 --> 00:15:31,493
We checked the whole neighborhood.
So far, nobody saw a thing.

129
00:15:33,298 --> 00:15:37,962
Leaving them like this, he must've been
really angry at them for some reason.

130
00:15:45,176 --> 00:15:48,009
Where would they keep their
vacuum cleaner?

131
00:15:52,417 --> 00:15:56,478
So, I'll bet you 100 bucks, Hawkins,
that there's no bag in this vacuum cleaner.

132
00:15:56,588 --> 00:15:58,886
I have no idea
what the hell you looking for.

133
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:00,924
He vacuumed the house

134
00:16:01,693 --> 00:16:03,320
and took the bag.

135
00:16:05,363 --> 00:16:08,526
Well, what if he killed somebody that
didn't have a vacuum cleaner?

136
00:16:08,633 --> 00:16:10,101
He wouldn't do that.

137
00:16:15,006 --> 00:16:18,271
Our best hope is if someone in there
saw something.

138
00:16:18,543 --> 00:16:20,374
- Detective Tracy Atwood?
- Yes?

139
00:16:20,478 --> 00:16:23,174
Hi. This is for you. You've been served.

140
00:16:23,982 --> 00:16:26,951
You fucking asshole! I am in the middle
of a fucking murder investigation.

141
00:16:27,051 --> 00:16:29,315
- Listen, lady, I'm just the messenger.
- Hawkins, what's the deal here?

142
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:32,287
Conroy, get this ass out of here.

143
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:33,755
What is it?

144
00:16:34,826 --> 00:16:38,227
My soon-to-be-ex-husband's scumbag
lawyer trying to show me

145
00:16:38,329 --> 00:16:41,389
just how painful she can make my life
if I don't give them what they want.

146
00:16:42,567 --> 00:16:44,364
Are there any new members?

147
00:16:44,469 --> 00:16:45,800
Okay.

148
00:16:48,373 --> 00:16:50,898
Hello, my name is Vaughn.

149
00:16:51,776 --> 00:16:53,767
I'm an alcoholic

150
00:16:54,045 --> 00:16:56,513
and I haven't had a drink in 10 months.

151
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:06,318
Hi. My name's Earl

152
00:17:06,424 --> 00:17:07,789
and I'm an addict.

153
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:19,028
- Anyone else?
- You are such a fucking hypocrite.

154
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:21,161
If you were honest
you'd step up there and say,

155
00:17:21,272 --> 00:17:23,968
"Hi, I'm Earl. I killed two people last night.

156
00:17:24,075 --> 00:17:28,136
"I really got off on it,
but I need your help to be cured."

157
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,681
I'm different, Marshall.
I won't argue that with you.

158
00:17:33,651 --> 00:17:36,085
But this is the only place that has ever
helped me be normal

159
00:17:36,187 --> 00:17:40,419
and I have been straight,
up until last night, for the past two years.

160
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:44,187
I'm not going to kill again

161
00:17:45,563 --> 00:17:49,363
and I am not going to quit coming here
because it upsets you.

162
00:17:50,802 --> 00:17:53,737
We need a clean-up crew for afterwards.

163
00:17:53,938 --> 00:17:56,099
We need some volunteers for the...

164
00:17:56,474 --> 00:17:58,271
Thank you, Earl. I appreciate that.

165
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:13,415
Based on your requirements,
this is our first attempt...

166
00:18:13,658 --> 00:18:17,389
<i>Mr. Brooks, your daughter
is waiting for you in your office.</i>

167
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:22,226
Well, I hope this is what you had in mind.

168
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:26,167
If not, we would love to work with you
further on the design.

169
00:18:26,404 --> 00:18:29,202
It's always fun to challenge our machines.

170
00:18:29,474 --> 00:18:31,499
Now, if you gentlemen would excuse me,

171
00:18:31,609 --> 00:18:34,703
I need to see how much
this is going to cost me.

172
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,342
Understand. Daughter cost money.

173
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:39,880
Me, too.

174
00:18:41,986 --> 00:18:44,147
I believe you do understand.

175
00:18:44,455 --> 00:18:47,788
Matt Johnson wants to schedule
a lunch for Friday. Can I talk to...

176
00:18:47,892 --> 00:18:50,588
- Sunday, did...
- Can you hold just a second?

177
00:18:53,231 --> 00:18:55,358
Did Jane call and say she was coming?

178
00:18:55,466 --> 00:18:58,162
I would have given you that message,
Mr. Brooks.

179
00:18:58,937 --> 00:19:00,700
- She in there?
- Yeah. She...

180
00:19:01,239 --> 00:19:04,299
She has some boxes
and suitcases downstairs.

181
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:06,843
And she didn't have any money
for the cab.

182
00:19:07,578 --> 00:19:09,375
And you paid for that?

183
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,107
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

184
00:19:11,215 --> 00:19:13,012
- Hold my calls.
- Sure.

185
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:14,885
I told you.

186
00:19:15,653 --> 00:19:17,587
When it's appropriate.

187
00:19:17,755 --> 00:19:19,347
You let me know.

188
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:22,151
And could I have some water?

189
00:19:23,661 --> 00:19:25,288
Hello, gorgeous.

190
00:19:28,599 --> 00:19:30,157
What are you doing here?

191
00:19:30,301 --> 00:19:31,928
I'm sorry, Daddy.

192
00:19:33,404 --> 00:19:35,497
Please don't be angry with me.

193
00:19:35,606 --> 00:19:38,166
All right, I can guess what you've done,
but why don't you tell me,

194
00:19:38,276 --> 00:19:40,506
and then I'll decide.

195
00:19:41,546 --> 00:19:43,514
I dropped out of school.

196
00:19:46,551 --> 00:19:47,643
Oh, Jane.

197
00:19:47,752 --> 00:19:50,380
Okay, have you told your mother?

198
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:52,623
No, I wanted to talk to you first.

199
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:54,555
Well, you're going to have to tell her,
Jane, all right?

200
00:19:54,659 --> 00:19:56,058
I'm not going to do that for you.

201
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:58,886
- Why can't you...
- Sit.

202
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:02,932
And then, together,
the three of us will decide

203
00:20:03,134 --> 00:20:04,624
where to go from here.

204
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:08,763
Okay, but I've thought a lot about this.
College is a waste of time for me.

205
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:10,901
How does...

206
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:14,809
How does somebody know that halfway
through their freshman year?

207
00:20:14,912 --> 00:20:17,745
You didn't even go to college, Daddy,
and you're successful.

208
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:19,976
I want to come work for you.

209
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:25,948
She's not telling you everything.
She's hiding something.

210
00:20:26,524 --> 00:20:27,684
I know.

211
00:20:31,963 --> 00:20:33,396
I'm not hiring right now, sweetheart.

212
00:20:33,498 --> 00:20:35,227
Okay, but just listen to me for one second.

213
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:36,300
Jane.

214
00:20:36,701 --> 00:20:37,759
All right.

215
00:20:37,969 --> 00:20:39,766
Look, what would happen to the business,

216
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:42,965
if, God forbid,
something were to happen to you?

217
00:20:43,741 --> 00:20:44,799
Okay.

218
00:20:44,909 --> 00:20:47,776
Mom would probably have to
sell to strangers.

219
00:20:48,112 --> 00:20:50,046
Now, look,
I'm willing to start at the bottom.

220
00:20:50,181 --> 00:20:52,672
You can treat me like a regular employee.

221
00:20:52,984 --> 00:20:57,387
I just want to learn everything there is
to know about running the box business.

222
00:20:57,488 --> 00:20:59,615
Then, when the time comes,

223
00:21:00,658 --> 00:21:02,683
it can stay in the family.

224
00:21:03,294 --> 00:21:04,261
Hmm.

225
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:07,989
Well, that's sweet, honey, but

226
00:21:08,232 --> 00:21:11,065
you're not talking about business.
You're talking about emotion.

227
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:12,693
Now, get up.

228
00:21:12,804 --> 00:21:16,570
In fact, your mother and I came this close
to selling out last year.

229
00:21:16,674 --> 00:21:17,732
- What?
- That's right.

230
00:21:17,842 --> 00:21:19,503
And had we been offered
a little more money,

231
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:22,841
and they still may come back to us,
we would sell.

232
00:21:23,781 --> 00:21:25,043
What would you do without the business?

233
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:29,045
Yes?

234
00:21:31,422 --> 00:21:34,823
I'm sorry. The man outside insisted
that I give this to you.

235
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:38,589
He claims that you'll find what's
inside very interesting.

236
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:41,160
What is he, Sunday? Is he a salesman?

237
00:21:41,299 --> 00:21:44,325
I've never seen him before. I'll just
give it back to him. I'll tell him to call...

238
00:21:44,435 --> 00:21:46,335
No, Sunday. Sunday, here.

239
00:21:47,738 --> 00:21:48,796
Thank you.

240
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:53,811
Jane,

241
00:21:54,312 --> 00:21:58,544
part of spending four years at college
is to give yourself a chance

242
00:21:58,649 --> 00:22:00,139
to find out

243
00:22:06,691 --> 00:22:08,215
who you are

244
00:22:09,127 --> 00:22:11,095
and what you want to do.

245
00:22:12,763 --> 00:22:16,028
I'll talk to Mom,
but I'm not going back to school.

246
00:22:16,767 --> 00:22:17,734
Mmm-hmm.

247
00:22:19,403 --> 00:22:21,394
And where would you live?

248
00:22:22,006 --> 00:22:23,974
To save money, I would move back home.

249
00:22:24,075 --> 00:22:27,340
But no rules, no curfew.
I want to be treated as an adult.

250
00:22:27,445 --> 00:22:29,538
And would you pay for rent?

251
00:22:31,149 --> 00:22:32,480
Hmm?

252
00:22:33,451 --> 00:22:35,043
Would you pay for food?

253
00:22:35,586 --> 00:22:39,852
No, Dad. You're a very wealthy man.
I think you can afford to keep me.

254
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:43,692
Sunday, would you show the gentleman
who gave you the envelope

255
00:22:43,794 --> 00:22:46,854
into the conference room and tell him
that I will meet him there?

256
00:22:46,964 --> 00:22:48,329
<i>No problem, Mr. Brooks.</i>

257
00:22:48,432 --> 00:22:49,399
And...

258
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:54,536
What happened to the BMW, Jane?

259
00:22:55,573 --> 00:22:59,339
A friend's going to drive it up.
It'll be here next weekend.

260
00:23:01,913 --> 00:23:03,642
And get Jane a cab.

261
00:23:05,516 --> 00:23:07,416
Call your mother.

262
00:23:08,286 --> 00:23:10,584
Are you going to give me a job?

263
00:23:11,222 --> 00:23:14,885
If it were up to me, and I think your
mother will agree with this,

264
00:23:15,993 --> 00:23:18,587
I think you should go back to school.

265
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:20,256
You see that, Marshall?

266
00:23:21,032 --> 00:23:24,160
That's why I didn't want to
do the dance couple!

267
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:27,001
Stop your fucking whining, Earl.

268
00:23:27,905 --> 00:23:30,396
You enjoyed doing that couple just as
much as I did.

269
00:23:30,508 --> 00:23:32,271
And look at the bright side.

270
00:23:32,376 --> 00:23:34,970
He came to us. He didn't go to the cops.

271
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:38,048
If he tries to shake us down, we kill him,
period!

272
00:23:38,149 --> 00:23:40,481
We make it fun, but we kill him.

273
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:42,909
End of story.

274
00:23:56,267 --> 00:23:58,462
What can I do for you, Mr...

275
00:23:58,569 --> 00:24:01,868
Let's say Smith.

276
00:24:02,473 --> 00:24:04,065
Okay, Mr. Smith.

277
00:24:07,578 --> 00:24:09,068
Before you get the wrong impression,
Mr. Brooks,

278
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:11,410
I'm not here to shake you down.

279
00:24:11,515 --> 00:24:15,349
Well, then, these are the only copies of
these photos, and you have no others.

280
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:17,817
No. I have other copies and other photos.

281
00:24:17,922 --> 00:24:19,753
And if anything happens to me...

282
00:24:20,091 --> 00:24:22,389
How did you find me, Mr. Smith?

283
00:24:23,027 --> 00:24:25,689
You're Man of the Year, Mr. Brooks.

284
00:24:28,566 --> 00:24:30,363
Your picture was in the paper.

285
00:24:30,468 --> 00:24:32,333
And if it hadn't have been...

286
00:24:34,472 --> 00:24:37,339
I don't know.
I don't know what I would've done.

287
00:24:37,441 --> 00:24:38,738
Lucky me.

288
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:41,911
What is it that I can help you with?

289
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:44,811
I've been watching that couple for months.

290
00:24:45,783 --> 00:24:48,877
Yeah. They liked to make love
with the blinds opened.

291
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:52,280
Sometimes I would take pictures.

292
00:24:52,623 --> 00:24:54,921
You know, visual aids for later.

293
00:24:57,962 --> 00:25:00,055
It's a great way to get off, I'll tell you that.

294
00:25:00,164 --> 00:25:01,893
It was fun, I thought,

295
00:25:02,233 --> 00:25:04,258
until I saw you kill them.

296
00:25:05,336 --> 00:25:07,327
And I have never, ever

297
00:25:07,438 --> 00:25:10,771
felt a rush like that, ever.

298
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,405
I know you're the Thumbprint Killer.

299
00:25:18,816 --> 00:25:20,807
You've done this before.

300
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:23,814
What I want...

301
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:25,949
What I want

302
00:25:26,057 --> 00:25:29,925
is for you to take me with you
next time you kill someone.

303
00:25:30,995 --> 00:25:33,190
And I'd like that to be soon.

304
00:25:42,573 --> 00:25:45,133
And you were worried
this was going to be unpleasant?

305
00:25:45,242 --> 00:25:46,732
The answer is simple.

306
00:25:46,877 --> 00:25:51,075
Just tell Mr. Smith
that you've decided never to kill again

307
00:25:51,182 --> 00:25:52,706
and he'll go away.

308
00:25:52,817 --> 00:25:55,479
You enjoy watching me suffer, don't you?

309
00:25:55,586 --> 00:25:57,110
In a word, yes.

310
00:25:58,122 --> 00:26:01,148
Where do you think
he has the other pictures?

311
00:26:02,893 --> 00:26:05,418
He put them in a safety deposit box,

312
00:26:06,297 --> 00:26:10,700
but I'll bet the box is at the bank
where he keeps his checking account,

313
00:26:11,268 --> 00:26:12,758
and the key

314
00:26:15,439 --> 00:26:17,498
is on his key chain.

315
00:26:19,276 --> 00:26:21,506
He really wants to do this.

316
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,873
He's not going to the cops.

317
00:26:31,622 --> 00:26:33,146
We have a deal?

318
00:26:37,128 --> 00:26:39,289
From the angle of these pictures,
you live on the third floor

319
00:26:39,397 --> 00:26:43,527
of the apartment building across the alley
from the couple's house.

320
00:26:45,102 --> 00:26:47,502
- Well...
- Yes or no, Mr. Smith?

321
00:26:48,706 --> 00:26:49,798
Yes.

322
00:26:51,041 --> 00:26:52,531
What time do you get home from work?

323
00:26:52,643 --> 00:26:55,203
6:30, 7:00, depending on the traffic.

324
00:26:57,948 --> 00:26:59,540
You can never come here again.

325
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:02,551
You can never call me.
Do you understand that?

326
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:03,844
Yes.

327
00:27:04,522 --> 00:27:05,614
Okay.

328
00:27:07,491 --> 00:27:09,118
Tomorrow night.

329
00:27:09,593 --> 00:27:12,289
Not tonight. Tomorrow night at 8:00,

330
00:27:12,396 --> 00:27:15,456
leave your apartment building
and walk east.

331
00:27:15,566 --> 00:27:17,466
I'll pick you up there.

332
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:28,168
- If you're thinking about doing anything...
- We're both aware of the rules, Mr. Smith.

333
00:27:30,247 --> 00:27:32,340
But I feel I must warn you.

334
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:35,880
If it turns out that you enjoy killing,

335
00:27:36,454 --> 00:27:38,684
it can become very addictive.

336
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:41,581
It could ruin your life.

337
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,855
I want to do this.

338
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:47,327
Okay.

339
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:53,033
Have I covered everything?

340
00:27:53,237 --> 00:27:55,535
I can't think of anything else.

341
00:27:56,207 --> 00:27:59,108
Then I'll see you tomorrow night,
Mr. Smith.

342
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:12,888
<i>We've talked to our client</i>

343
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:16,892
and we've come up with a figure
that we feel is more than fair.

344
00:28:18,596 --> 00:28:21,656
We can have a check for that amount
in your office by 6:00.

345
00:28:21,765 --> 00:28:25,792
Oh, well, we told you in the beginning
what we wanted. That hasn't changed.

346
00:28:25,903 --> 00:28:29,134
We feel our offer is more than generous.

347
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,731
I paid for everything
while we were together.

348
00:28:31,842 --> 00:28:35,403
And now I'm being asked
to give this guy a bonus?

349
00:28:36,514 --> 00:28:41,178
For spending time with me? Time that I've
already paid for in the first place?

350
00:28:41,285 --> 00:28:45,346
You know as well as I do, counselor,
you're not going to get $1.5 million.

351
00:28:45,456 --> 00:28:48,254
Oh, I don't know that. No.

352
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:52,022
Well, in fact, this is the front page of
yesterday's paper.

353
00:28:53,864 --> 00:28:55,855
"Hangman escapes."

354
00:28:55,966 --> 00:29:00,733
"After torturing his victims, Thorton
Meeks would hang them in public places,

355
00:29:00,838 --> 00:29:04,001
"church steeples, balconies,
freeway overpasses..."

356
00:29:04,108 --> 00:29:05,871
Where is this going?

357
00:29:05,976 --> 00:29:09,036
Well, your client captured Mr. Meeks.

358
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:12,745
Come on, Tracy,
this is not a lot of money for you.

359
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:15,045
And we both know how frightened I was

360
00:29:15,152 --> 00:29:17,985
after Meeks said he was going to escape
and come back and kill you.

361
00:29:18,088 --> 00:29:19,715
Let me ask again.

362
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:21,551
What is your point?

363
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:25,288
Our point is that Meeks
or someone like Meeks

364
00:29:25,396 --> 00:29:28,854
may come after my client
in order to hurt your client.

365
00:29:29,533 --> 00:29:31,933
That's very imaginative, counselor,

366
00:29:32,036 --> 00:29:34,732
but it's not based in reality at all.

367
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,199
Jesse?

368
00:29:36,307 --> 00:29:38,468
Now, just let us handle this, please?

369
00:29:38,576 --> 00:29:39,668
- Tracy...
- Jesse,

370
00:29:39,777 --> 00:29:43,269
you know what would make me feel
really safe right now?

371
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:48,411
If you got hit by a truck

372
00:29:48,619 --> 00:29:49,916
and died.

373
00:29:52,122 --> 00:29:53,680
Well, that's it.

374
00:29:53,791 --> 00:29:55,986
Mr. Vialo and I are leaving.

375
00:29:56,093 --> 00:29:58,527
You've threatened the safety of my client.

376
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:01,193
We're going to have to
get a restraining order.

377
00:30:01,298 --> 00:30:02,925
See you in court.

378
00:30:04,501 --> 00:30:06,731
"Get hit by a truck and die."

379
00:30:08,539 --> 00:30:10,473
Fuck it. It felt good.

380
00:30:11,041 --> 00:30:14,238
It's not what's here,
it's what's not here that's interesting.

381
00:30:14,345 --> 00:30:17,314
I mean, if I didn't know better, I'd say
these people were killed by a ghost.

382
00:30:17,514 --> 00:30:21,814
The autopsy said there was a tiny piece
of plastic in the female victim's brain.

383
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:23,546
It's a dead end. He bags the gun.

384
00:30:23,654 --> 00:30:26,885
He puts a one-gallon plastic freezer
bag over his hand to his wrist.

385
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:31,428
The little bit of plastic comes out with
the first slug and the shells go in the bag.

386
00:30:31,528 --> 00:30:32,927
I hear you're looking for me.

387
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:36,158
I received a subpoena from your husband
for your work records,

388
00:30:36,266 --> 00:30:39,724
where you were, date and times,
for the past two years.

389
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:41,767
They're just trying to blackmail me
into a settlement,

390
00:30:41,872 --> 00:30:44,306
but my lawyers assure me
that it'll never go to court.

391
00:30:44,408 --> 00:30:46,603
I can't take that chance.

392
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:49,304
Almost three quarters
of your cases are current,

393
00:30:49,413 --> 00:30:53,577
so until you settle your divorce,
I'm going to have to put you on a desk.

394
00:30:53,684 --> 00:30:55,549
That's also blackmail.

395
00:30:56,453 --> 00:30:58,648
Do you have any idea
what this guy has done to me?

396
00:30:58,756 --> 00:31:01,884
While we were married?
While I was paying for everything?

397
00:31:01,992 --> 00:31:04,756
He was just out fucking every woman
he could get his hands on.

398
00:31:04,862 --> 00:31:07,490
He fucked my friends.
He fucked my cousin!

399
00:31:07,598 --> 00:31:09,589
- He made me look like an idiot.
- And?

400
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,292
And what?

401
00:31:11,502 --> 00:31:12,901
Get over it.

402
00:31:13,671 --> 00:31:16,874
You can't grow old as a woman without
having at least one lousy man in your life.

403
00:31:16,874 --> 00:31:17,738
You can't grow old as a woman without
having at least one lousy man in your life.

404
00:31:17,841 --> 00:31:21,004
Well, I made him an offer and I'm not
going to give him a dime more.

405
00:31:21,211 --> 00:31:23,771
- Did you hear that Meeks escaped?
- Yeah.

406
00:31:23,881 --> 00:31:27,510
I've got every unit looking for him.
Do you want me to put a detail on you?

407
00:31:27,618 --> 00:31:30,052
I think I can take care of myself.

408
00:31:30,854 --> 00:31:35,553
That's one of your biggest problems,
Tracy. You don't know how to ask for help.

409
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:26,403
What the fuck? What the fuck?

410
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:28,373
Don't worry.

411
00:32:28,479 --> 00:32:31,880
If I were here to kill you,
you would already be dead.

412
00:32:35,619 --> 00:32:40,215
After you left today, I realized that
our friendship was a little one-sided.

413
00:32:40,491 --> 00:32:44,655
So, tomorrow night when we meet,
would you be so kind as to bring

414
00:32:44,762 --> 00:32:48,254
all the pictures and the memory card
from your camera?

415
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:52,257
That way we can like each other
simply for who we are.

416
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:54,961
If you don't show up,

417
00:32:55,539 --> 00:32:58,531
I will presume that
you've gone to the police

418
00:32:58,709 --> 00:33:00,472
and I will kill you.

419
00:33:01,078 --> 00:33:03,012
Even if I go to jail because of you,
Mr. Smith,

420
00:33:03,113 --> 00:33:05,911
someone will find you, wherever you are,

421
00:33:06,383 --> 00:33:08,283
and they will kill you.

422
00:33:16,794 --> 00:33:18,159
Mr. Brooks?

423
00:33:21,932 --> 00:33:23,331
Mr. Brooks?

424
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,567
Mr. Brooks.

425
00:33:37,648 --> 00:33:38,979
Mr. Brooks?

426
00:33:58,001 --> 00:33:59,093
Wow!

427
00:34:46,016 --> 00:34:48,143
It's nice to have you home.

428
00:35:01,765 --> 00:35:03,198
Doesn't my happiness mean anything...

429
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,267
Hello. Hello.

430
00:35:04,401 --> 00:35:08,667
You have to explain things to me
because I'm your mother. That's why.

431
00:35:14,111 --> 00:35:15,874
What's wrong, girls?

432
00:35:19,182 --> 00:35:20,149
Hmm?

433
00:35:24,054 --> 00:35:26,648
Ask your daughter what the real reason is
she dropped out of school.

434
00:35:26,757 --> 00:35:29,123
I told you, it's not the real reason.

435
00:35:29,226 --> 00:35:31,160
Honey, you wanted to go to college.

436
00:35:31,395 --> 00:35:34,159
You had good grades. Your father pulled in
favors to get you into that school.

437
00:35:34,264 --> 00:35:37,290
If this isn't the reason, then please,
dear God, tell me the reason.

438
00:35:37,501 --> 00:35:41,301
Why does your mother think
that you've dropped out of school?

439
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,034
I'm pregnant.

440
00:35:45,142 --> 00:35:46,609
But that's not the reason I dropped out.

441
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:50,874
Being pregnant wouldn't keep me
from going to school if I wanted to.

442
00:35:55,919 --> 00:35:57,580
Who's the father?

443
00:35:58,422 --> 00:36:00,287
Some guy I was seeing.

444
00:36:00,424 --> 00:36:01,982
Some guy? Does he know?

445
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:04,760
Of course he knows, Dad.
He's married and got two kids

446
00:36:04,861 --> 00:36:06,351
and wants nothing to do with me.

447
00:36:06,463 --> 00:36:07,794
Oh, honey.

448
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:10,664
Oh, honey.

449
00:36:10,801 --> 00:36:13,326
I'm not going to go through with it,
so there's nothing to be upset about.

450
00:36:13,437 --> 00:36:14,734
I mean, I wasn't even going
to tell you guys.

451
00:36:14,838 --> 00:36:17,568
There will be no abortion, Jane.

452
00:36:18,575 --> 00:36:21,009
No, Dad. You're not going
to tell me what to do, okay?

453
00:36:21,144 --> 00:36:24,079
It's my body and I'll do what I want with it.

454
00:36:29,653 --> 00:36:32,383
I'm sorry, you're right. I said it wrong.

455
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:35,986
I wasn't trying to tell you what to do.
What I was...

456
00:36:38,962 --> 00:36:41,260
What I was trying to say is that

457
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:43,765
a grandchild would be a wonderful gift

458
00:36:44,134 --> 00:36:46,034
for your mother and me.

459
00:36:48,538 --> 00:36:50,631
Would you really
want to have a grandchild?

460
00:36:50,741 --> 00:36:52,732
Even if I'm not married?

461
00:36:54,077 --> 00:36:55,101
Yes.

462
00:36:57,014 --> 00:36:59,141
A child is what's important. We would...

463
00:37:00,717 --> 00:37:03,948
We would love it
and cherish it completely. And we would...

464
00:37:05,055 --> 00:37:07,148
We would help you raise it.

465
00:37:09,493 --> 00:37:12,690
If it means that much to you,
I'll think about it.

466
00:37:21,938 --> 00:37:25,101
I'm going to have to start getting up
a little earlier, aren't I?

467
00:37:25,208 --> 00:37:26,573
Oh, my God.

468
00:37:31,248 --> 00:37:33,239
Well, we were right.

469
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:35,011
She was hiding something.

470
00:37:35,118 --> 00:37:38,645
Pregnant's not all of it.
She's hiding something bigger.

471
00:37:43,627 --> 00:37:45,561
Something much bigger.

472
00:37:45,695 --> 00:37:47,788
- You think so?
- I know so.

473
00:37:49,132 --> 00:37:50,599
And so do you.

474
00:38:52,729 --> 00:38:55,721
It's darker tonight
than it was on your night.

475
00:38:56,633 --> 00:38:58,066
But still...

476
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:01,699
How did you manage to not
bump into the furniture?

477
00:39:16,486 --> 00:39:19,284
Was the light on? Or did you turn it on?

478
00:39:19,556 --> 00:39:23,014
Because I know you,
and you wouldn't risk a shot in the dark.

479
00:39:34,371 --> 00:39:35,505
Where have you been?

480
00:39:35,505 --> 00:39:36,130
Where have you been?

481
00:39:36,606 --> 00:39:39,097
Did you miss the thrill of killing?

482
00:39:47,984 --> 00:39:50,384
What if these are stuck closed

483
00:39:51,054 --> 00:39:53,352
because you yanked them closed?

484
00:39:55,625 --> 00:39:57,388
Which would mean...

485
00:40:00,397 --> 00:40:03,560
They were open
when you came into the room.

486
00:40:10,207 --> 00:40:12,675
Thank you. I appreciate your time.

487
00:40:15,779 --> 00:40:18,043
- Sorry. Sorry.
- No, I'm sorry.

488
00:40:18,815 --> 00:40:22,114
I was just about to knock.
I'm Detective Atwood, Portland Police.

489
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:24,847
- How are you doing this evening?
- Fine.

490
00:40:25,355 --> 00:40:28,119
You a photographer, Mr. Baffert?

491
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:29,889
- No.
- No?

492
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:35,026
Thank you. No, actually
it's kind of a hobby. I just started.

493
00:40:36,399 --> 00:40:38,458
Well, I don't know if you're aware,
but there was a murder.

494
00:40:38,568 --> 00:40:41,002
Yes, in the house across the way.

495
00:40:41,104 --> 00:40:46,098
Well, you didn't happen to see anything
unusual or suspicious that night, did you?

496
00:40:46,776 --> 00:40:51,270
No. No. I wondered
that when it happened, but no.

497
00:40:52,415 --> 00:40:53,575
I'm sorry.

498
00:40:53,984 --> 00:40:57,545
I'm supposed to be meeting somebody
and I don't want to be late.

499
00:40:57,654 --> 00:41:00,646
Well, here's my card,
if you do hear something.

500
00:41:01,024 --> 00:41:02,719
Remember anything.

501
00:41:03,927 --> 00:41:06,521
Yeah, I wish I could be more help, but...

502
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:07,927
Sorry.

503
00:41:22,412 --> 00:41:23,936
He looks clean.

504
00:41:26,049 --> 00:41:27,983
Looks like he's alone.

505
00:41:28,084 --> 00:41:32,418
No, I'll tell you, he really wants to do this.

506
00:41:33,857 --> 00:41:36,951
Maybe I should pull over there
and pick him up.

507
00:41:37,761 --> 00:41:39,251
No, just honk.

508
00:41:39,996 --> 00:41:44,592
Maybe he'll get killed crossing the street
and save us the mess of doing it.

509
00:42:03,753 --> 00:42:05,118
Almost.

510
00:42:17,834 --> 00:42:19,734
It's coming down hard.

511
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:21,867
They say it will be sunny tomorrow.

512
00:42:21,971 --> 00:42:24,667
I never trust those guys. They say
it's going to be clear and then it rains,

513
00:42:24,774 --> 00:42:27,868
and they say it's going to rain
and it's sunny.

514
00:42:29,412 --> 00:42:32,404
I believe this is what you asked for.

515
00:42:35,085 --> 00:42:37,883
The pictures
and the memory card, all here?

516
00:42:39,422 --> 00:42:40,389
Boom.

517
00:42:42,392 --> 00:42:46,829
You and I both know
that not all the pictures are in here.

518
00:42:47,330 --> 00:42:50,766
And you made a copy of the memory card,
isn't that so?

519
00:42:52,068 --> 00:42:54,366
But you understand my position.

520
00:42:56,172 --> 00:42:57,696
Yes, I do.

521
00:42:58,174 --> 00:43:00,165
But it's my hope that once you get to
know me better,

522
00:43:00,276 --> 00:43:04,770
you'll feel comfortable in giving me
everything that I have asked you for.

523
00:43:07,183 --> 00:43:08,616
Sounds fair.

524
00:43:09,886 --> 00:43:12,719
I thought you might be interested in this.

525
00:43:13,356 --> 00:43:16,348
This is the policewoman
who is looking for you.

526
00:43:17,327 --> 00:43:21,058
Wow. We've never known anyone
who was looking for us before.

527
00:43:22,098 --> 00:43:25,295
We're going to have to find out
everything there is to know about this

528
00:43:25,435 --> 00:43:26,732
woman.

529
00:43:28,338 --> 00:43:30,306
This is close, Marshall.

530
00:43:31,007 --> 00:43:32,872
This is too damn close.

531
00:43:36,379 --> 00:43:38,506
So, what's the plan?

532
00:43:39,983 --> 00:43:41,644
What do we...

533
00:43:41,751 --> 00:43:43,719
What are we doing here, tonight?

534
00:43:44,754 --> 00:43:47,780
We drive around until we see someone
we think we might

535
00:43:47,891 --> 00:43:49,381
enjoy killing.

536
00:43:52,562 --> 00:43:53,756
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

537
00:43:53,963 --> 00:43:56,124
You don't have somebody in mind?

538
00:43:56,232 --> 00:44:00,498
I don't enjoy this, Mr. Smith.
I do it because I'm addicted to it.

539
00:44:01,704 --> 00:44:04,935
And before you entered my life I vowed
that I would never kill again.

540
00:44:05,041 --> 00:44:07,669
So this is your party.

541
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:13,044
You can choose anyone you want
and we'll do it together.

542
00:44:19,522 --> 00:44:21,820
Can it be somebody that I know?

543
00:44:28,131 --> 00:44:29,257
No.

544
00:44:30,266 --> 00:44:32,666
You never kill someone you know.

545
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:35,665
It's the easiest way to get caught.

546
00:44:36,806 --> 00:44:37,795
Okay?

547
00:44:37,907 --> 00:44:38,999
Yeah.

548
00:44:42,212 --> 00:44:43,577
Buckle up.

549
00:44:46,449 --> 00:44:49,543
<i>You look a little bit like that E.T. guy.</i>

550
00:44:49,652 --> 00:44:51,813
Remember that movie
when he flies on the bike?

551
00:44:51,921 --> 00:44:54,082
- Yeah, yeah. I like that movie.
- Yeah.

552
00:45:56,586 --> 00:45:58,144
Jesus Christ.

553
00:46:02,759 --> 00:46:05,626
Fuck him! It's his fault. He's an asshole.

554
00:46:06,963 --> 00:46:08,225
Fuck you.

555
00:46:11,067 --> 00:46:15,163
Maybe Mr. Smith would like to kill
the driver of the pickup.

556
00:46:19,342 --> 00:46:21,902
What about the driver of the pickup?

557
00:46:24,447 --> 00:46:26,210
What if we kill him?

558
00:46:28,418 --> 00:46:29,612
Yes.

559
00:46:29,719 --> 00:46:31,448
Yes! I've always wanted to
fucking kill somebody

560
00:46:31,554 --> 00:46:33,852
who fucked with me in traffic.

561
00:46:34,824 --> 00:46:38,783
Well, do you want to kill the driver of
the pickup or the owner?

562
00:46:41,531 --> 00:46:43,556
They may not be the same.

563
00:46:46,269 --> 00:46:47,668
The driver.

564
00:46:48,705 --> 00:46:49,797
Okay.

565
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:53,170
We'll drive around until
we get a good look at him or her.

566
00:46:54,143 --> 00:46:56,668
Would it bother you to kill a woman?

567
00:46:57,380 --> 00:46:58,506
No.

568
00:46:58,615 --> 00:47:00,742
No, an asshole's an asshole.

569
00:47:08,658 --> 00:47:10,091
I wasn't in town that night.

570
00:47:10,193 --> 00:47:11,751
My roommate was.
Maybe he saw something.

571
00:47:11,861 --> 00:47:14,989
- Well, may I speak to him?
- He's on his way to Tokyo right now.

572
00:47:15,164 --> 00:47:17,359
He's also a flight attendant.

573
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:20,958
Did the victims ever leave their
bedroom curtains open?

574
00:47:21,471 --> 00:47:22,665
All the time.

575
00:47:22,772 --> 00:47:24,501
I don't know if they thought we couldn't
see them doing it,

576
00:47:24,707 --> 00:47:28,040
if that's what you're asking,
or if they didn't care.

577
00:47:28,711 --> 00:47:30,906
Well, here's my card.
If you could have your roommate call me,

578
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:33,608
and the people at this number know how
to reach me any time of day or night.

579
00:47:33,716 --> 00:47:35,513
I won't be here. But I'll leave him a note.

580
00:47:35,618 --> 00:47:37,609
- Okay, great. Thank you.
- Sure.

581
00:48:32,275 --> 00:48:35,711
Would you recognize him
if you saw his driver's license picture?

582
00:48:36,879 --> 00:48:38,005
Yeah.

583
00:48:39,716 --> 00:48:43,152
I've memorized the license number.
You write it down.

584
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:45,515
I got it.

585
00:48:47,690 --> 00:48:48,816
Wow.

586
00:48:50,426 --> 00:48:52,690
Well, when you get home,
go on the Internet.

587
00:48:52,862 --> 00:48:55,660
Find out everything you can
about this guy.

588
00:48:56,299 --> 00:48:59,132
- We aren't going to kill him tonight?
- No.

589
00:49:00,002 --> 00:49:03,494
We could,
but then we wouldn't be in control.

590
00:49:03,639 --> 00:49:05,698
We could leave loose ends.

591
00:49:06,175 --> 00:49:08,700
And we both know the danger of that.

592
00:49:09,679 --> 00:49:11,078
Yeah, we do.

593
00:49:17,887 --> 00:49:19,616
What are you doing?

594
00:49:23,426 --> 00:49:25,053
What are you doing?

595
00:49:25,161 --> 00:49:26,685
Look at me.

596
00:49:26,796 --> 00:49:28,457
- Look at me.
- Why?

597
00:49:29,632 --> 00:49:31,156
Close your eyes.

598
00:49:31,267 --> 00:49:32,996
- Why?
- Close them.

599
00:49:35,171 --> 00:49:37,537
What's the license plate number?

600
00:49:41,677 --> 00:49:42,735
Shit!

601
00:49:42,845 --> 00:49:45,336
- P, 4...
- No.

602
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:49,047
I know it's Oregon.

603
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:50,744
Because of the tree?

604
00:49:52,288 --> 00:49:56,224
Don't feel bad. I've been doing this
a long time. Pen, paper.

605
00:49:56,526 --> 00:49:59,154
Look out the window and write it down.

606
00:50:00,363 --> 00:50:01,330
Okay.

607
00:50:01,798 --> 00:50:04,062
What was your first time like?

608
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:07,898
You really don't want to know
that much about me, Mr. Smith.

609
00:50:24,654 --> 00:50:27,179
No, I think that was right.
Go back.

610
00:50:28,357 --> 00:50:30,188
Okay. We're in.

611
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,793
For all the taxes we pay,
you'd think they'd make it more difficult

612
00:50:33,896 --> 00:50:37,059
to hack into the police personnel file.

613
00:50:39,035 --> 00:50:41,026
Her father's Gerald Atwood.

614
00:50:41,137 --> 00:50:43,401
Why does that ring a bell?

615
00:50:44,373 --> 00:50:46,500
- Someone you did business with?
- No.

616
00:50:46,609 --> 00:50:49,203
Someone we killed?

617
00:50:49,312 --> 00:50:51,337
No, not someone we killed.

618
00:50:51,747 --> 00:50:55,547
Let me see here.
MBA, College of William and Mary.

619
00:50:55,751 --> 00:50:57,912
She's been a cop for 12 years.

620
00:50:58,020 --> 00:51:00,955
Married Dr. Carlson, divorced Dr. Carlson,

621
00:51:01,057 --> 00:51:05,016
married a Jesse Vialo, restaurateur.

622
00:51:05,127 --> 00:51:09,621
Separates from Jesse Vialo,
sued for support by Jesse Vialo,

623
00:51:09,732 --> 00:51:13,862
seeing a shrink because of Jesse Vialo.

624
00:51:17,573 --> 00:51:19,666
She's caught a lot of people.

625
00:51:19,775 --> 00:51:21,299
And look here.

626
00:51:21,878 --> 00:51:25,211
This isn't the first time
she's been looking for us.

627
00:51:26,749 --> 00:51:28,046
Okay, here we are.

628
00:51:29,085 --> 00:51:30,279
Jesse Vialo.

629
00:51:30,386 --> 00:51:31,648
Good-looking,

630
00:51:32,622 --> 00:51:34,487
a little younger than she is.

631
00:51:34,624 --> 00:51:36,990
Younger, restaurateur...

632
00:51:38,694 --> 00:51:40,787
She married him on the rebound
from the doctor

633
00:51:40,897 --> 00:51:44,628
and I'll bet he married her
for her money and connections.

634
00:51:44,934 --> 00:51:48,495
Just because her old man's rich
doesn't mean she's rich.

635
00:51:49,605 --> 00:51:51,095
Maybe he's one of the kind of guys

636
00:51:51,207 --> 00:51:54,472
that would rather give it to the opera
than to his kids.

637
00:51:55,978 --> 00:51:59,778
Wouldn't she have to declare any
outside income and holdings?

638
00:52:11,227 --> 00:52:14,253
You are... You are a genius.

639
00:52:15,965 --> 00:52:17,990
The opera didn't get much.

640
00:52:19,268 --> 00:52:20,235
Hmm.

641
00:52:21,237 --> 00:52:25,970
Why would a woman worth
60-plus million dollars,

642
00:52:26,075 --> 00:52:28,202
and probably more to come

643
00:52:30,513 --> 00:52:32,105
want to be a cop?

644
00:52:32,882 --> 00:52:34,747
I like that about her.

645
00:52:36,585 --> 00:52:40,282
You are such a fucking snob, Earl.
You like her because she's rich.

646
00:52:40,389 --> 00:52:42,949
No, I like her because
she's found something that's hers.

647
00:52:43,059 --> 00:52:45,857
It's not the family business
and she's good at it.

648
00:52:46,028 --> 00:52:49,794
I'd like Jane to find something that's hers

649
00:52:50,232 --> 00:52:52,496
and that she could be good at.

650
00:52:55,905 --> 00:52:59,432
That's exactly why Atwood
scares the shit out of me.

651
00:52:59,542 --> 00:53:01,976
She's a cop who doesn't need the money

652
00:53:02,878 --> 00:53:04,709
and she's looking for us.

653
00:53:04,814 --> 00:53:07,146
That's one fucking dangerous
human being.

654
00:53:09,385 --> 00:53:13,685
The fact that you're not wrong does not
make me admire her any less.

655
00:53:14,857 --> 00:53:16,688
- Hey, Nancy.
- Hi, Tracy.

656
00:53:16,792 --> 00:53:18,521
Thank you for meeting me here.
I got you a latte.

657
00:53:18,627 --> 00:53:21,460
Thanks. Do you mind if we walk and talk
while I hear about your big idea?

658
00:53:21,630 --> 00:53:22,654
Sure.

659
00:53:22,765 --> 00:53:25,666
- You really want to settle this?
- If I can.

660
00:53:26,969 --> 00:53:29,096
I'd like to use your father.

661
00:53:29,305 --> 00:53:32,001
No. My father does nothing for nothing.

662
00:53:32,108 --> 00:53:35,703
Tracy, I understand, but your father
has a lot of political muscle.

663
00:53:35,811 --> 00:53:38,780
Now, his pull won't make everything
go away, but it'll be a tremendous help.

664
00:53:38,881 --> 00:53:40,746
Absolutely not.

665
00:53:40,950 --> 00:53:43,418
You're right.
We could have done this all on the phone.

666
00:53:43,519 --> 00:53:45,510
If you're willing to play the game and
ride the desk for a year,

667
00:53:45,621 --> 00:53:47,612
I'm sure we can settle at 1.25, 1.5.

668
00:53:47,723 --> 00:53:49,088
I'm not sitting on a desk.

669
00:53:49,191 --> 00:53:52,524
Then the only other option is your father.
Or money.

670
00:53:55,164 --> 00:53:57,132
1.5, and that's it.

671
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:59,932
Okay. I'll call them today.

672
00:54:01,103 --> 00:54:04,266
I just need to get this done
as soon as possible.

673
00:54:04,974 --> 00:54:07,340
That's what Jesse's counting on.

674
00:54:08,310 --> 00:54:10,835
I'll call you when I have something.

675
00:54:12,548 --> 00:54:13,708
Oh, Tracy!

676
00:54:14,450 --> 00:54:19,717
Your husband says there's a picture of him
holding some trophy that you still have?

677
00:54:19,822 --> 00:54:22,052
What picture? He has everything.

678
00:54:22,158 --> 00:54:27,289
He claims it's his favorite picture, and you
put it up where you store your suitcases.

679
00:54:27,730 --> 00:54:28,958
I'll look.

680
00:54:29,065 --> 00:54:30,760
I know. Petty.

681
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:34,191
But you're going through a divorce.

682
00:54:34,804 --> 00:54:36,772
Thanks for the latte.

683
00:54:59,695 --> 00:55:02,425
I told you I was coming back to get you.

684
00:55:03,265 --> 00:55:06,564
I already found a place
where I'm going to hang you.

685
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:08,969
But first...

686
00:55:10,272 --> 00:55:13,332
I'm going to watch her
have some fun with you.

687
00:55:15,411 --> 00:55:19,040
Then she's going to watch me
have some fun with you.

688
00:55:20,549 --> 00:55:22,278
You know the drill.

689
00:55:34,530 --> 00:55:36,122
Don't fucking move!

690
00:55:36,232 --> 00:55:37,563
Shoot me!

691
00:55:38,134 --> 00:55:40,466
Come on, shoot me, motherfucker!

692
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:22,033
Five down.

693
00:56:22,678 --> 00:56:24,771
"Sleeper's demon."

694
00:56:25,481 --> 00:56:27,176
Sleeper's demon.

695
00:56:27,716 --> 00:56:28,944
Incubus.

696
00:56:33,889 --> 00:56:36,050
Maybe he went home with someone else.

697
00:56:36,158 --> 00:56:38,353
Can you still see his pickup?

698
00:56:38,694 --> 00:56:39,661
Mmm-hmm.

699
00:56:40,496 --> 00:56:45,297
This is not the kind of guy who leaves
his pickup in an unguarded lot overnight.

700
00:56:46,969 --> 00:56:48,129
How do you know that?

701
00:56:48,237 --> 00:56:51,138
Somebody didn't do
their homework last night.

702
00:56:56,278 --> 00:56:58,371
"Tom Sawyer's villain."

703
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:00,277
Tom Sawyer's villain.

704
00:57:06,689 --> 00:57:08,179
Let me get it.

705
00:57:08,357 --> 00:57:10,188
- Injun Joe.
- Yeah.

706
00:57:20,102 --> 00:57:22,468
Where do we know that guy from?

707
00:57:27,977 --> 00:57:31,208
You really should pay more attention
to what you read, Earl.

708
00:57:31,313 --> 00:57:34,214
Well, that's what I have you for, Marshall.

709
00:57:34,450 --> 00:57:37,908
His picture was on the front page of
the papers a couple days ago

710
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:42,252
because he escaped from jail.
He's the killer they call The Hangman.

711
00:57:43,826 --> 00:57:47,193
Remember that cop that you like?

712
00:57:47,596 --> 00:57:48,790
Atwood?

713
00:57:50,833 --> 00:57:52,562
Who's chasing us?

714
00:57:52,668 --> 00:57:54,966
She's the one who put him away.

715
00:57:56,905 --> 00:58:00,500
Well, well, well. What would life be

716
00:58:01,710 --> 00:58:03,405
without surprises?

717
00:58:03,912 --> 00:58:05,903
There he is. There he is!

718
00:58:10,119 --> 00:58:11,552
You know what's wild?

719
00:58:11,654 --> 00:58:16,250
This guy, I bet he's got all sorts of
plans for tonight, tomorrow night...

720
00:58:16,759 --> 00:58:19,353
He has no idea he'll already be dead.

721
00:58:20,329 --> 00:58:22,820
He won't be able to do any of them. Nope.

722
00:58:28,304 --> 00:58:30,932
I don't think I want to kill this guy.

723
00:58:32,207 --> 00:58:33,367
What?

724
00:58:33,475 --> 00:58:37,434
I love what you are thinking.

725
00:58:39,114 --> 00:58:42,447
You have no idea what I am thinking.

726
00:58:43,018 --> 00:58:46,647
Yes, I do, and it's wonderfully twisted.

727
00:58:47,489 --> 00:58:50,322
Wait a minute. You promised.

728
00:58:50,426 --> 00:58:52,326
I know I said we would,

729
00:58:53,529 --> 00:58:55,156
but I don't think it would be
that much fun.

730
00:58:55,264 --> 00:58:57,232
So that's it? Just no?

731
00:58:58,367 --> 00:58:59,425
Yes.

732
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:03,238
I see.

733
00:59:04,606 --> 00:59:07,006
- Did you get the license plate?
- Yeah.

734
00:59:08,077 --> 00:59:10,136
We found the van
in an underground parking lot

735
00:59:10,245 --> 00:59:12,110
about two miles
from where they left you.

736
00:59:12,214 --> 00:59:14,079
It was stolen last night.

737
00:59:14,183 --> 00:59:16,310
We're checking security camera tapes.

738
00:59:16,418 --> 00:59:20,320
If Meeks and the woman left in a car,
we'll have a license plate number.

739
00:59:20,422 --> 00:59:22,185
These are the women we have pictures of
who know Meeks.

740
00:59:22,291 --> 00:59:25,089
None of the attendants
remember seeing them.

741
00:59:25,194 --> 00:59:26,957
What about that chiropractor,
Alvin Griffin?

742
00:59:27,062 --> 00:59:28,654
You know,
the one who sold Meeks the steroids.

743
00:59:28,764 --> 00:59:31,460
We've had a tap on his phone
ever since Meeks escaped.

744
00:59:31,567 --> 00:59:34,832
No contact there so far,
and he sure isn't going to talk to us.

745
00:59:34,937 --> 00:59:36,268
How about a warrant to search the house?

746
00:59:36,372 --> 00:59:38,101
You get me in the door
and he'll talk to me.

747
00:59:38,207 --> 00:59:40,232
How's your divorce going?

748
00:59:42,177 --> 00:59:45,271
I took your advice
and told my lawyer to settle.

749
00:59:45,848 --> 00:59:49,340
- None of these are the woman in the van.
- Whoa. Trying to suture up here.

750
00:59:49,451 --> 00:59:51,681
- Sorry.
- And your ego can handle that?

751
00:59:52,588 --> 00:59:54,920
No, but it doesn't like the other choices.

752
00:59:55,023 --> 00:59:59,426
Because the FBI is riding hard on me
to take over the Thumbprint Killer.

753
01:00:01,096 --> 01:00:04,088
Until Meeks is caught,
Hawkins is with you.

754
01:00:05,801 --> 01:00:09,396
Nothing personal, Hawkins,
but I don't think you'd take a bullet for me.

755
01:00:09,505 --> 01:00:12,531
I wouldn't take the bullet,
I might push you out of the way.

756
01:00:12,641 --> 01:00:15,610
I'll give you two days. Then I want
a progress report on your divorce.

757
01:00:15,711 --> 01:00:17,702
Look, I have all the pieces
for the Thumbprint Killer.

758
01:00:17,813 --> 01:00:20,611
I'm just not looking at it the right way.

759
01:00:20,883 --> 01:00:23,750
I'll keep the FBI out of it for three days.

760
01:00:25,554 --> 01:00:26,885
That is ugly.

761
01:00:33,929 --> 01:00:37,421
Mr. Smith wants you to notice
that he's pouting.

762
01:00:39,935 --> 01:00:41,493
Yes, I know.

763
01:01:00,656 --> 01:01:04,092
I know you're upset, Mr. Smith,
and I am sorry.

764
01:01:04,193 --> 01:01:06,184
Yeah. I'm upset.

765
01:01:10,432 --> 01:01:14,163
Maybe I was a little abrupt back there,
but let me explain.

766
01:01:14,269 --> 01:01:18,035
Finding someone
you think would be fun to kill is a bit like...

767
01:01:19,208 --> 01:01:20,937
Well, it's a bit like falling in love.

768
01:01:21,043 --> 01:01:24,979
You meet a lot of candidates, and
you like some of them and they're nice,

769
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:26,911
but they're not right.

770
01:01:27,015 --> 01:01:31,543
And that special one comes along,
and your heart,

771
01:01:31,653 --> 01:01:36,283
it beats faster
and you know that's the one.

772
01:01:37,059 --> 01:01:40,995
The man in the pickup
did not make my heart beat faster.

773
01:01:41,897 --> 01:01:44,730
Okay, the man didn't
make your heart beat faster.

774
01:01:44,833 --> 01:01:46,130
Then who?

775
01:01:46,835 --> 01:01:48,962
I don't know, but I think...

776
01:01:51,173 --> 01:01:53,437
I think I have someone in mind.

777
01:01:54,176 --> 01:01:57,737
- Do you want me to do some work on it?
- No, let's just...

778
01:01:58,780 --> 01:02:01,112
Let's just see how it plays out.

779
01:02:02,684 --> 01:02:05,949
That's what I'm talking about.
That's my problem.

780
01:02:06,054 --> 01:02:08,682
That makes me feel
like I'm being jerked around!

781
01:02:08,790 --> 01:02:11,020
It was supposed to be last night
and then it was going to be tonight!

782
01:02:11,126 --> 01:02:13,754
And now it's, "Let's see how it plays out."

783
01:02:13,862 --> 01:02:17,855
I feel like you're...
I feel like you're backing out of our deal.

784
01:02:19,101 --> 01:02:20,796
- I don't like how that feels.
- I promise you.

785
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:23,428
I promise you it will happen.

786
01:02:23,639 --> 01:02:24,833
When?

787
01:02:25,274 --> 01:02:28,835
When is it going to happen, Mr. Brooks?
When?

788
01:02:29,645 --> 01:02:32,273
Tomorrow night. Same time.

789
01:02:33,415 --> 01:02:36,782
When you come out of your building,
I want you to turn right.

790
01:02:36,885 --> 01:02:39,945
Go to the first street
that you can go west on.

791
01:02:40,522 --> 01:02:44,618
- I will pick you up on that street.
- Okay.

792
01:02:49,932 --> 01:02:51,490
I want to do this.

793
01:02:51,633 --> 01:02:55,262
But if it continues to drag out,
I could change my mind.

794
01:02:56,004 --> 01:02:56,971
Hmm.

795
01:02:57,205 --> 01:03:00,231
Don't you think I want to do this,
Mr. Smith?

796
01:03:00,342 --> 01:03:03,004
Maybe you don't think
that you have to anymore.

797
01:03:14,156 --> 01:03:18,456
Even if that guy was charming and funny,
I still wouldn't like him.

798
01:03:54,363 --> 01:03:56,297
- Hi.
- Hi.

799
01:03:58,867 --> 01:04:00,198
What can I do for you?

800
01:04:00,302 --> 01:04:02,998
Detective Smolny,
Portland Police Department.

801
01:04:03,105 --> 01:04:06,905
This is Detective Carfagno.
She's from Palo Alto, California.

802
01:04:21,790 --> 01:04:22,848
Emma.

803
01:04:24,793 --> 01:04:25,851
Emma!

804
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:35,302
Did Jane ever tell you
that there was a murder at her school?

805
01:04:35,404 --> 01:04:37,770
- No.
- Nothing?

806
01:04:38,940 --> 01:04:43,502
Not that a friend died or
someone she knew died? Or some...

807
01:04:43,612 --> 01:04:45,807
Somebody in her dorm died?

808
01:04:47,549 --> 01:04:49,016
No. Why?

809
01:04:49,351 --> 01:04:53,310
Well, there are two detectives downstairs.
One of them is from Palo Alto.

810
01:04:53,422 --> 01:04:55,390
They want to ask her some questions
about a murder

811
01:04:55,490 --> 01:04:58,357
that occurred there
shortly before she came home.

812
01:04:58,727 --> 01:05:00,092
Gosh.

813
01:05:01,997 --> 01:05:04,431
Well, I'm sure if she was close
to somebody who was murdered

814
01:05:04,533 --> 01:05:05,932
she would've said something.

815
01:05:06,034 --> 01:05:07,194
Yeah.

816
01:05:09,504 --> 01:05:12,667
I called Roger.
He suggested a criminal attorney.

817
01:05:13,642 --> 01:05:15,837
They'll be here within the hour.

818
01:05:18,313 --> 01:05:20,178
Yeah. I'll get dressed.

819
01:05:22,517 --> 01:05:25,486
- This is too close.
- I know!

820
01:05:35,630 --> 01:05:37,825
Jane,
how well did you know Phillip Ramsey?

821
01:05:37,933 --> 01:05:41,869
He and I were in a couple classes together,
but that's about it.

822
01:05:41,970 --> 01:05:44,632
- Did you ever drive him to class?
- No.

823
01:05:46,041 --> 01:05:48,942
You ever been to his apartment?
Do you know where he lives?

824
01:05:49,044 --> 01:05:52,571
- Which complex was he in?
- What happened to your BMW, Jane?

825
01:05:53,548 --> 01:05:57,575
It was actually stolen,
Sunday night or Monday morning.

826
01:05:59,287 --> 01:06:00,481
Detective, hold on a second.

827
01:06:00,589 --> 01:06:03,251
My understanding
is that she's not a suspect.

828
01:07:00,081 --> 01:07:01,844
Well, that was interesting.

829
01:07:03,652 --> 01:07:08,214
- You know, I don't feel so well.
- I think you should lie down. Okay?

830
01:07:08,323 --> 01:07:10,120
I think she should lie down.

831
01:07:16,698 --> 01:07:19,997
Dad, I'm sorry I didn't say anything before.

832
01:07:20,101 --> 01:07:24,162
It was really horrible,
but, I didn't know the guy that well and...

833
01:07:24,272 --> 01:07:26,900
It happened around the same time
I found out I was pregnant,

834
01:07:27,008 --> 01:07:30,535
- so it just kind of went out of my mind.
- I understand.

835
01:07:36,017 --> 01:07:38,144
I'm going to go up with her.

836
01:07:49,731 --> 01:07:51,790
God help me. What do I do?

837
01:07:56,805 --> 01:07:58,238
She did it.

838
01:07:59,441 --> 01:08:00,908
Didn't she?

839
01:08:02,677 --> 01:08:03,974
Yeah.

840
01:08:05,180 --> 01:08:09,810
It'll take the cops a week to 10 days
to put their case together and then...

841
01:08:11,019 --> 01:08:13,817
And then they will come back
and arrest her.

842
01:08:18,493 --> 01:08:20,518
What are you going to do?

843
01:08:41,917 --> 01:08:43,248
Oh, God.

844
01:08:43,952 --> 01:08:47,854
Oh, God! I've been afraid of this
since before she was born.

845
01:08:50,091 --> 01:08:51,353
She has...

846
01:08:52,460 --> 01:08:54,155
She has what I have.

847
01:08:54,930 --> 01:08:56,420
Yes, she does.

848
01:08:57,532 --> 01:09:00,763
But you were always smart about it.
She was stupid.

849
01:09:03,138 --> 01:09:06,972
She did it because she got off on it.
Okay, I understand.

850
01:09:07,075 --> 01:09:10,044
She did it for fun. Okay, I understand.

851
01:09:11,413 --> 01:09:17,283
But why didn't she think it through?
A hatchet? And she left it there?

852
01:09:22,424 --> 01:09:24,255
They were pretty graphic, weren't they?

853
01:09:24,359 --> 01:09:26,486
That was to shock her
into making a mistake.

854
01:09:26,594 --> 01:09:28,391
What does she think I think?

855
01:09:29,965 --> 01:09:31,330
Didn't she remember what she told me,

856
01:09:31,433 --> 01:09:35,199
that the BMW was being driven across
the country by a friend?

857
01:09:35,303 --> 01:09:38,431
Now, right in front of me,
she tells the cops that it was stolen.

858
01:09:38,540 --> 01:09:42,670
You always cleaned up after her,
whatever she did, all her life.

859
01:09:47,682 --> 01:09:50,810
If the BMW
has anything incriminating in it,

860
01:09:50,919 --> 01:09:52,648
I hope it was stolen.

861
01:09:52,921 --> 01:09:55,481
Or she dropped it
at the bottom of a very deep lake.

862
01:09:55,590 --> 01:09:57,455
Think she knows
how much trouble she's in?

863
01:09:57,559 --> 01:09:58,924
I think...

864
01:09:59,661 --> 01:10:01,686
I think she thought
she'd gotten away with it,

865
01:10:01,796 --> 01:10:03,855
until the cops showed up.

866
01:10:06,267 --> 01:10:08,531
I should have listened to her.

867
01:10:09,604 --> 01:10:13,040
She was trying to tell me. It was there.

868
01:10:14,476 --> 01:10:17,536
"I didn't quit school
because I was pregnant."

869
01:10:18,813 --> 01:10:20,303
I should've dug deeper.

870
01:10:20,415 --> 01:10:21,516
And where would you be but at exactly
the same place that you are now?

871
01:10:21,516 --> 01:10:24,815
And where would you be but at exactly
the same place that you are now?

872
01:10:25,453 --> 01:10:27,512
It's not your fault, Earl.

873
01:10:28,123 --> 01:10:31,991
Part of your problem with her
is that you always think it is.

874
01:10:32,093 --> 01:10:36,962
She has what I have, Marshall.
So, on a very basic level, it is my fault!

875
01:10:38,299 --> 01:10:40,494
What are you going to do?

876
01:10:56,551 --> 01:11:00,317
Maybe the best thing for her
would be to let her go to jail.

877
01:11:06,061 --> 01:11:08,086
What about her child?

878
01:11:08,196 --> 01:11:10,721
Emma and I would help her raise it.

879
01:11:14,102 --> 01:11:17,594
You might be right, Earl. You know?
You just might be.

880
01:11:19,841 --> 01:11:22,071
Because if she's not stopped,
she's going to kill again,

881
01:11:22,177 --> 01:11:26,807
and if she really wants
to take over the box business,

882
01:11:26,915 --> 01:11:29,110
the next victim could be

883
01:11:32,387 --> 01:11:33,547
you.

884
01:11:40,762 --> 01:11:43,162
I don't think she'd go that far.

885
01:11:57,412 --> 01:11:58,379
Hey.

886
01:11:58,513 --> 01:12:02,108
We received a counteroffer.
Are you sitting down?

887
01:12:02,650 --> 01:12:05,949
<i>- Yeah, go ahead.
- $5 million.</i>

888
01:12:06,688 --> 01:12:10,624
Oh, my God. You got to be kidding me.
He can't get that, can he?

889
01:12:10,859 --> 01:12:13,419
No, no, no, my sense of it is
that by asking for five

890
01:12:13,528 --> 01:12:16,326
they're hoping you settle
anywhere between 2.5 and 3.

891
01:12:16,431 --> 01:12:18,160
Shit. Can you stall them?

892
01:12:18,566 --> 01:12:20,466
Well,
they know you want this done quickly,

893
01:12:20,568 --> 01:12:22,695
so they're going to expect
a quick counteroffer.

894
01:12:22,971 --> 01:12:25,872
Look, I need two days. Just wait two days.

895
01:12:25,974 --> 01:12:30,707
Tell them that it's a big number
and that I have to think about it.

896
01:12:30,812 --> 01:12:34,748
<i>- Okay.
- Oh, and that picture that he wanted?</i>

897
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:41,247
Tell him I couldn't find it.

898
01:12:45,793 --> 01:12:47,420
Yes, Mr. Brooks?

899
01:12:49,597 --> 01:12:50,996
Mr. Brooks?

900
01:12:52,667 --> 01:12:54,032
Mr. Brooks?

901
01:12:55,136 --> 01:12:58,663
Before you open your mouth

902
01:12:58,773 --> 01:13:03,176
be very sure this is the right thing to do.

903
01:13:03,711 --> 01:13:06,271
I will never be sure.

904
01:13:09,150 --> 01:13:11,710
You get pissed at me

905
01:13:11,819 --> 01:13:15,721
because I'm always the one
arguing to go ahead and do murder.

906
01:13:15,823 --> 01:13:19,418
Not this time, Earl. This is your decision.

907
01:13:20,094 --> 01:13:23,928
I know it's wrong.
I know in my heart it's wrong.

908
01:13:25,867 --> 01:13:27,528
Then don't do it.

909
01:13:29,504 --> 01:13:32,632
Go with Mr. Smith tonight and finish that

910
01:13:32,740 --> 01:13:36,904
and let the police put Jane in jail.
Hopefully that will save her

911
01:13:37,011 --> 01:13:41,539
and we can happily go on
with our tortured lives.

912
01:13:42,550 --> 01:13:45,348
That's exactly what I want to do.

913
01:13:45,453 --> 01:13:49,617
That's exactly what I should do.
The thing is, she is my daughter.

914
01:13:50,592 --> 01:13:52,219
And I love her.

915
01:13:53,895 --> 01:13:55,226
Mr. Brooks?

916
01:14:01,469 --> 01:14:03,027
I'm going home.

917
01:14:05,073 --> 01:14:08,975
- Cancel everything for the rest of the day.
- I'll take care of it.

918
01:14:09,077 --> 01:14:13,207
If you need me, need me, Sunday,
I'll be at my studio.

919
01:14:13,314 --> 01:14:14,838
Call me there.

920
01:14:15,683 --> 01:14:20,177
I probably won't pick up,
so just leave a message.

921
01:14:21,956 --> 01:14:24,049
I'll try not to bother you.

922
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:55,047
The thing that bothers me about this,

923
01:14:55,156 --> 01:14:59,525
besides the fact
that we are not prepared and

924
01:15:00,728 --> 01:15:04,892
a multitude of other things
is what does Mr. Smith do

925
01:15:04,999 --> 01:15:09,629
when he's walking west tonight
and you don't show up?

926
01:15:09,737 --> 01:15:12,228
That little freak could flip out.

927
01:15:14,475 --> 01:15:18,434
I will take care of it
on the way to the airport.

928
01:15:22,317 --> 01:15:23,443
What are we doing?

929
01:15:23,551 --> 01:15:24,882
What are we doing? What are we doing?

930
01:15:24,986 --> 01:15:28,717
You sound like a whiny-ass kid.
We're playing a hunch.

931
01:15:28,823 --> 01:15:31,189
We've been following this guy all day.

932
01:15:31,292 --> 01:15:33,089
He's boring, okay?

933
01:15:33,194 --> 01:15:34,889
And everything we run on him
comes up clean.

934
01:15:34,996 --> 01:15:37,988
Well, if it didn't,
it wouldn't be called a hunch.

935
01:15:38,099 --> 01:15:41,500
Meeks, he's the guy
we should be looking for. Meeks.

936
01:15:42,236 --> 01:15:45,262
Look where? Please, tell me.

937
01:15:46,341 --> 01:15:50,368
Look, everyone knows who Meeks is
and is looking for him.

938
01:15:50,478 --> 01:15:53,743
The chiropractor was the last link
to his old life that I know.

939
01:15:53,848 --> 01:15:56,112
If we're going to find him now,
then somebody's going to turn him in,

940
01:15:56,217 --> 01:15:59,744
or we're going to trip over him
at a bus stop.

941
01:15:59,854 --> 01:16:04,154
On the other hand, nobody knows who
the Thumbprint Killer is or where he is.

942
01:16:04,258 --> 01:16:08,126
However, I have a fucking hunch
that this guy, Baffert, does.

943
01:16:08,229 --> 01:16:10,527
I've got two days to play that hunch.

944
01:16:10,631 --> 01:16:12,292
So, if you think
you're wasting your time with me,

945
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:14,834
then I'd be happy to do it alone.

946
01:16:15,837 --> 01:16:19,796
I had a fight with my wife this morning.
What's your problem?

947
01:16:21,309 --> 01:16:24,107
My husband wants $5 million.

948
01:16:34,522 --> 01:16:37,013
Here you are, sir. Sir?

949
01:16:40,328 --> 01:16:41,625
Thank you.

950
01:16:48,269 --> 01:16:52,569
God, grant me the serenity
to accept the things that I cannot change,

951
01:16:52,673 --> 01:16:56,404
courage to change the things I can,
and wisdom to know the difference.

952
01:16:56,511 --> 01:16:59,781
Living one day at a time,
enjoying one moment at a time.

953
01:17:50,998 --> 01:17:53,091
That's it for you, asshole!

954
01:18:01,008 --> 01:18:02,339
Remember me?

955
01:18:02,443 --> 01:18:06,140
Can you step out of the car, please?
I want to talk to you.

956
01:18:10,351 --> 01:18:12,751
So, Mr. Baffert,
what is it that you have to tell me?

957
01:18:12,854 --> 01:18:15,084
What do you mean?
I don't have anything to tell you.

958
01:18:15,189 --> 01:18:19,285
Really? Because I was driving around
and I suddenly got this feeling

959
01:18:19,393 --> 01:18:22,260
that you had something to tell me
about the murders.

960
01:18:22,797 --> 01:18:25,595
No. Nothing.

961
01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:27,793
Well, that's disappointing,

962
01:18:28,135 --> 01:18:32,572
because when I left,
after we talked last time,

963
01:18:32,673 --> 01:18:35,699
I felt I had missed a clue
that was right in front of me

964
01:18:35,810 --> 01:18:38,244
that could solve this whole case.

965
01:18:38,846 --> 01:18:41,508
I don't know why you would feel that.

966
01:18:42,216 --> 01:18:45,049
Didn't you tell me
that you were an amateur potter,

967
01:18:45,152 --> 01:18:47,450
that you liked to make bowls and vases?

968
01:18:47,555 --> 01:18:54,154
No, I told you that my hobby
was photography and not pottery.

969
01:18:56,130 --> 01:18:58,155
Well, maybe that was it.

970
01:18:59,534 --> 01:19:01,729
The flight attendant upstairs
said the victims

971
01:19:01,836 --> 01:19:05,829
liked to keep their bedroom curtains open
when they had sex.

972
01:19:05,940 --> 01:19:10,001
Could I see some of those photos
you took of that couple?

973
01:19:34,035 --> 01:19:36,970
You're harassing me, Detective Atwood.

974
01:19:37,071 --> 01:19:41,804
You knew very well that I'm not a potter,
and I don't have any pictures.

975
01:19:42,143 --> 01:19:43,804
So my feeling is your feeling is wrong,

976
01:19:43,911 --> 01:19:46,846
and you should just move your car
and let me go home.

977
01:19:49,650 --> 01:19:52,278
What's your job here? What do you do?

978
01:19:53,354 --> 01:19:55,413
I'm a mechanical engineer.

979
01:19:56,324 --> 01:19:59,293
Wow, you got to be really smart for that,
don't you?

980
01:19:59,393 --> 01:20:00,587
I guess.

981
01:20:01,262 --> 01:20:03,560
Then be smart, Mr. Baffert.

982
01:20:05,266 --> 01:20:08,099
Because you lied to me,
right there at the end.

983
01:20:10,104 --> 01:20:11,901
I'll be watching you.

984
01:20:12,340 --> 01:20:16,401
When you want to tell me the truth,
you know how to get in touch with me.

985
01:20:16,510 --> 01:20:18,205
See you later, alligator.

986
01:20:33,761 --> 01:20:36,696
Captain Lister got us that search warrant
for Meeks' chiropractor.

987
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:40,897
That's good.
God damn it, this guy knows something.

988
01:20:41,002 --> 01:20:43,334
He almost told me
and then something happened.

989
01:20:43,437 --> 01:20:44,734
Think he did it?

990
01:20:45,773 --> 01:20:48,367
I don't think it's quite that simple.

991
01:20:48,809 --> 01:20:50,709
You want to call for backup?

992
01:20:50,978 --> 01:20:54,004
Yeah, we should be ready for anything.
In fact, get a canine unit and a chopper.

993
01:20:54,115 --> 01:20:57,175
I don't have the energy to chase this guy
if he decides to run.

994
01:21:31,819 --> 01:21:34,515
<i>Mr. Alvin Griffin, you are surrounded.</i>

995
01:21:37,324 --> 01:21:40,521
<i>Lay down on the floor
with your hands on top of your head.</i>

996
01:21:45,666 --> 01:21:46,928
Clear.

997
01:21:50,337 --> 01:21:53,170
Meeks was a steroid freak.
This was usually full.

998
01:21:53,274 --> 01:21:54,798
It's empty now.

999
01:21:55,209 --> 01:21:59,202
- You think Meeks has Alvin with him?
- He thinks Alvin turned him in.

1000
01:21:59,313 --> 01:22:00,541
On me.

1001
01:22:53,667 --> 01:22:57,694
Hawkins, meet Alvin Griffin.

1002
01:24:10,411 --> 01:24:12,038
How do you feel?

1003
01:24:15,716 --> 01:24:16,842
Dirty.

1004
01:24:18,719 --> 01:24:20,584
That's understandable.

1005
01:24:21,889 --> 01:24:25,450
You've never killed for this reason before.
The feeling will pass.

1006
01:24:25,559 --> 01:24:27,220
I don't think so.

1007
01:24:28,028 --> 01:24:30,292
That's the whole thing, Marshall.

1008
01:24:30,397 --> 01:24:34,857
If I could find a way to just end it all,

1009
01:24:34,969 --> 01:24:38,871
disappear where there was
absolutely no trace of me,

1010
01:24:38,973 --> 01:24:40,600
because eventually
I will get caught doing this

1011
01:24:40,708 --> 01:24:44,610
and it will be very embarrassing for me
and Emma and Jane.

1012
01:24:45,913 --> 01:24:47,778
So I've been thinking.

1013
01:24:49,116 --> 01:24:53,212
Is there a way that Mr. Smith could kill me
and make me disappear?

1014
01:24:56,457 --> 01:24:59,551
Well, number one, Mr. Smith is not
smart enough to do that.

1015
01:24:59,660 --> 01:25:01,423
- I know that.
- Number two,

1016
01:25:01,528 --> 01:25:06,158
there is no reason, if you're careful,
to believe you will ever get caught.

1017
01:25:08,202 --> 01:25:11,865
I know that I will have to plan it
for Mr. Smith, but I think...

1018
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:14,632
I think that's what I want to do.

1019
01:25:14,742 --> 01:25:18,007
Well, I'm not particularly fond
of that plan, Earl.

1020
01:25:18,879 --> 01:25:22,747
Remember, if you die, I go with you,
and I like being alive.

1021
01:25:22,850 --> 01:25:27,878
I like eating. I like fucking. I like killing.

1022
01:25:28,822 --> 01:25:30,949
I have to end it, Marshall.

1023
01:25:31,525 --> 01:25:36,087
One way or another.
And I think this is the best way.

1024
01:25:42,536 --> 01:25:44,026
Fuck you, then!

1025
01:25:46,874 --> 01:25:47,841
Come on.

1026
01:26:12,579 --> 01:26:13,978
- Hi.
- Hi.

1027
01:26:14,081 --> 01:26:15,673
- You worked all night?
- Yeah,

1028
01:26:15,783 --> 01:26:19,913
I had ideas for pots that took too long,
and the clay kept winning.

1029
01:26:20,454 --> 01:26:21,978
It'll be fine.

1030
01:26:25,392 --> 01:26:32,230
Oh, and there's this yellow Chinese glaze
that I'm trying to get right.

1031
01:26:59,726 --> 01:27:02,490
Hey, Daddy.
Thought you'd be gone already.

1032
01:27:04,097 --> 01:27:05,359
Roger called.

1033
01:27:06,233 --> 01:27:09,532
There was another murder last night
at your school.

1034
01:27:09,636 --> 01:27:10,603
Oh?

1035
01:27:11,438 --> 01:27:15,374
Yeah. Done the same way
as the one they talked to you about,

1036
01:27:15,475 --> 01:27:18,808
right down to the hatchet
being left at the scene.

1037
01:27:22,583 --> 01:27:25,177
They think they have a serial killer.

1038
01:27:25,519 --> 01:27:30,047
Obviously, you were here last night,
so you're in the clear.

1039
01:27:31,658 --> 01:27:35,185
Wow, that's... That's good news, isn't it?
I mean...

1040
01:27:35,963 --> 01:27:39,899
Even if you're innocent,
it's good to know you're not a suspect.

1041
01:27:41,635 --> 01:27:42,602
Oh, yeah.

1042
01:27:43,036 --> 01:27:44,503
How's the...

1043
01:27:45,806 --> 01:27:47,865
How's the morning sickness?

1044
01:27:50,244 --> 01:27:52,144
Better than yesterday.

1045
01:27:53,981 --> 01:27:56,575
You want to have lunch with me today?

1046
01:27:57,818 --> 01:28:01,447
I'd love to, but I don't know
how I'm going to feel later.

1047
01:28:02,623 --> 01:28:03,920
Thank you.

1048
01:28:19,606 --> 01:28:21,471
Do you love me, Jane?

1049
01:28:23,010 --> 01:28:26,946
Of course I love you, Daddy.
You're my father.

1050
01:28:35,923 --> 01:28:39,051
Have you decided
whether or not to have the baby?

1051
01:28:39,960 --> 01:28:41,154
Not yet.

1052
01:28:43,463 --> 01:28:44,691
Okay.

1053
01:29:25,372 --> 01:29:27,067
It's time to go.

1054
01:29:33,613 --> 01:29:38,312
"Dear Emma and Jane, my loves.

1055
01:29:38,418 --> 01:29:39,908
"I have a terminal illness

1056
01:29:40,020 --> 01:29:44,889
"and instead of subjecting you
to my deterioration,

1057
01:29:44,992 --> 01:29:47,483
"I have decided to disappear.

1058
01:29:48,929 --> 01:29:52,296
<i>"Don't try to find me.
I don't want to be found.</i>

1059
01:29:52,399 --> 01:29:55,562
<i>"Please believe
that the time I spent with you</i>

1060
01:29:55,669 --> 01:29:58,365
<i>"brought me the greatest joy of my life.</i>

1061
01:30:00,073 --> 01:30:03,201
"Love, Dad."

1062
01:30:06,680 --> 01:30:09,308
So you're going to go through with it?

1063
01:30:11,485 --> 01:30:13,646
It's all planned to work out.

1064
01:30:28,101 --> 01:30:32,231
- Ready to rock and roll, Mr. Smith?
- Yeah.

1065
01:30:44,184 --> 01:30:48,644
I smell gun oil.
Different gun oil than yours.

1066
01:30:49,723 --> 01:30:51,452
He brought his gun.

1067
01:30:52,893 --> 01:30:56,021
After he gets what he wants,
he plans to kill me.

1068
01:30:56,129 --> 01:30:57,118
Oh.

1069
01:30:57,230 --> 01:31:00,859
Now I get it. You were counting on this.

1070
01:31:01,535 --> 01:31:03,526
It has a certain logic.

1071
01:31:03,870 --> 01:31:06,668
But if your plan was to have him kill you,

1072
01:31:06,773 --> 01:31:10,265
why do you have to
kill somebody else first?

1073
01:31:12,179 --> 01:31:15,706
He'll need to see that
to get up the courage to kill me.

1074
01:31:16,883 --> 01:31:19,443
Not even you believe that, Earl.

1075
01:31:20,520 --> 01:31:22,988
It just makes it more exciting, doesn't it?

1076
01:31:23,457 --> 01:31:25,789
To think that he's going to kill you
after you kill somebody else.

1077
01:31:25,892 --> 01:31:30,761
You're getting your rocks off, big time.
That's why you're doing this.

1078
01:31:30,864 --> 01:31:34,561
Not true. And if it were, so what?

1079
01:31:42,709 --> 01:31:45,075
Hello? Yeah, put him through.

1080
01:31:45,178 --> 01:31:47,646
<i>I just got your message.</i>

1081
01:31:48,348 --> 01:31:51,044
The weird thing is
that they closed their curtains.

1082
01:31:51,151 --> 01:31:53,142
At first they were open,
like they always were,

1083
01:31:53,253 --> 01:31:55,744
and they were making love,
like they always did.

1084
01:31:55,856 --> 01:31:58,416
<i>Then when I looked again,
the curtains were closed</i>

1085
01:31:58,525 --> 01:32:00,550
<i>and there were
what looked like camera flashes</i>

1086
01:32:00,660 --> 01:32:02,218
<i>coming from behind the curtains.</i>

1087
01:32:02,329 --> 01:32:05,025
<i>- Camera flashes?
- That's what it looked like.</i>

1088
01:32:05,298 --> 01:32:07,323
That's why he poses them.

1089
01:32:07,801 --> 01:32:10,201
<i>- I'm sorry?
- No, no, nothing.</i>

1090
01:32:10,637 --> 01:32:13,401
Look, the guy you should talk to
is the guy on the floor below us.

1091
01:32:13,573 --> 01:32:15,165
Would that be a Mr. Baffert?

1092
01:32:15,742 --> 01:32:17,232
Yeah. He told me once

1093
01:32:17,344 --> 01:32:20,609
that he had taken some great pictures
of that couple making love.

1094
01:32:20,714 --> 01:32:22,011
He's the one you should talk to.

1095
01:32:22,916 --> 01:32:24,508
Okay, great. Thank you.

1096
01:32:30,624 --> 01:32:31,682
<i>- Yeah.
- Hawkins?</i>

1097
01:32:31,791 --> 01:32:34,760
Meet me at Baffert's apartment
with a search warrant.

1098
01:32:42,435 --> 01:32:43,663
Put these on.

1099
01:32:53,480 --> 01:32:54,879
Nice outfit.

1100
01:33:05,859 --> 01:33:09,226
Try a couple of deep breaths
through your nose.

1101
01:33:12,265 --> 01:33:15,462
- I have to take a crap so bad.
- What?

1102
01:33:15,569 --> 01:33:17,628
I have to take a crap.

1103
01:33:19,873 --> 01:33:21,465
We won't be long.

1104
01:33:48,368 --> 01:33:49,392
Crap.

1105
01:33:58,278 --> 01:34:03,045
Called your wife's lawyer.
They're thinking about the $5 million.

1106
01:34:17,597 --> 01:34:20,589
Realistically,
how much you think we can get?

1107
01:34:21,268 --> 01:34:24,999
Well, if we go to court,
best case scenario, two.

1108
01:34:25,105 --> 01:34:27,903
I think we should hold firm for three.

1109
01:34:29,009 --> 01:34:30,840
Let's not get piggish.

1110
01:34:31,645 --> 01:34:35,103
2.5, 2.7 would still be a great deal.

1111
01:34:41,921 --> 01:34:43,684
There's more if we want it.

1112
01:34:45,258 --> 01:34:49,194
We have to do this quickly. Remember?
Marie's meeting us here.

1113
01:34:50,163 --> 01:34:51,130
Yes.

1114
01:34:53,700 --> 01:34:57,500
- We could ask her to join us.
- It's not funny.

1115
01:35:03,810 --> 01:35:05,334
Are we alone?

1116
01:35:06,813 --> 01:35:07,973
Yeah.

1117
01:35:20,627 --> 01:35:21,787
Hello.

1118
01:35:28,468 --> 01:35:29,594
Do it.

1119
01:35:30,403 --> 01:35:31,392
Do it.

1120
01:35:33,106 --> 01:35:34,403
Don't do that.

1121
01:35:38,478 --> 01:35:39,968
Mr. Baffert?

1122
01:35:41,548 --> 01:35:42,674
Mr. Baffert?

1123
01:35:43,650 --> 01:35:44,674
Yes!

1124
01:35:44,784 --> 01:35:46,217
Yes!

1125
01:35:47,020 --> 01:35:48,988
Yes! You are the fucking man.

1126
01:35:49,689 --> 01:35:56,618
Oh, man, did you see the look on her face?
The look on her fucking face was great!

1127
01:35:57,163 --> 01:35:59,097
It was great. It was fantastic.

1128
01:35:59,199 --> 01:36:04,034
That was everything
that I hoped it would be.

1129
01:36:04,804 --> 01:36:07,705
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1130
01:36:10,477 --> 01:36:13,412
Mr. Baffert? Knock-knock?

1131
01:36:17,016 --> 01:36:18,483
Anybody home?

1132
01:36:27,894 --> 01:36:29,327
Mr. Baffert?

1133
01:36:33,099 --> 01:36:34,225
Hello?

1134
01:36:56,756 --> 01:36:59,224
Obviously, Baffert's gone... Hey.

1135
01:37:00,293 --> 01:37:02,022
Obviously Baffert's gone.

1136
01:37:02,128 --> 01:37:04,653
God damn it, Hawkins.
Don't you ever knock?

1137
01:37:04,898 --> 01:37:06,695
I wasn't able to get the search warrant.

1138
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:09,701
Well, we might've just gotten lucky.
This is the moving company's work order,

1139
01:37:09,803 --> 01:37:12,738
and this looks like the address
where they're taking Baffert's stuff.

1140
01:37:12,839 --> 01:37:16,070
- Where were you when you called me?
- I was at home, in bed.

1141
01:37:16,176 --> 01:37:17,905
Can you prove that?

1142
01:37:18,011 --> 01:37:21,208
I was at home in bed.
Why do I need to prove that?

1143
01:37:23,483 --> 01:37:27,010
Your husband, Jesse,
and his lawyer were killed tonight.

1144
01:37:29,556 --> 01:37:31,251
Get the fuck out.

1145
01:37:32,492 --> 01:37:34,357
It looks like the Thumbprint Killer.

1146
01:37:34,461 --> 01:37:37,658
I've been ordered to bring you in
for questioning.

1147
01:37:38,798 --> 01:37:39,856
Why?

1148
01:37:40,767 --> 01:37:42,632
I didn't want Jesse dead.

1149
01:37:42,735 --> 01:37:45,135
Look, I hated what he was doing to me,
but I didn't want him dead.

1150
01:37:45,238 --> 01:37:47,900
Got it on the record,
said you wanted him dead.

1151
01:37:48,007 --> 01:37:51,170
And who better
to fake a Thumbprint killing than you?

1152
01:37:51,277 --> 01:37:53,745
You don't actually believe I'd do that.

1153
01:37:53,847 --> 01:37:57,681
If our jobs have taught us anything, Tracy,
it's that people do strange things.

1154
01:37:57,784 --> 01:37:59,046
They just want to ask you some questions.

1155
01:37:59,152 --> 01:38:01,882
And I'm happy to answer their questions
after we go check out this address.

1156
01:38:01,988 --> 01:38:03,956
- I have to take you in.
- Look, this is the answer

1157
01:38:04,057 --> 01:38:07,026
to the Thumbprint Killer
and this is where I'm going.

1158
01:38:07,126 --> 01:38:10,391
Don't make me cuff you,
because I will if I have to.

1159
01:38:17,537 --> 01:38:19,471
It'd be really nice if you could go with me,

1160
01:38:19,572 --> 01:38:22,700
but if you do and this goes bad,
then they're going to burn your ass.

1161
01:38:22,809 --> 01:38:25,369
- So this never happened.
- You're nuts.

1162
01:38:25,478 --> 01:38:27,708
Yeah, that's what they say.

1163
01:38:31,050 --> 01:38:34,315
- Here comes the gun.
- Yep.

1164
01:38:38,091 --> 01:38:39,524
What are you doing?

1165
01:38:40,126 --> 01:38:42,686
You're smart enough to figure that out,
Mr. Brooks.

1166
01:38:42,795 --> 01:38:45,423
Well, we're going 65 miles an hour,
Mr. Smith.

1167
01:38:45,532 --> 01:38:48,262
If you shoot me now,
there's a good chance that we'll both die.

1168
01:38:48,368 --> 01:38:50,893
Not now. Take this next off-ramp.

1169
01:38:52,872 --> 01:38:54,237
You mean this one?

1170
01:38:57,343 --> 01:39:00,039
That wouldn't be very smart of me,
now would it?

1171
01:39:04,651 --> 01:39:08,519
Think about this, numb-nuts.
You pissed yourself back there.

1172
01:39:08,621 --> 01:39:11,385
You left your DNA
at the scene of a double homicide

1173
01:39:11,491 --> 01:39:14,517
and there is nothing to indicate
that I was ever there.

1174
01:39:15,895 --> 01:39:19,854
If the cops do an analysis of that urine,
and they will,

1175
01:39:19,966 --> 01:39:22,332
you are the Thumbprint Killer.

1176
01:39:23,603 --> 01:39:25,127
No. No.

1177
01:39:26,039 --> 01:39:28,564
I have pictures of you
from the first murder.

1178
01:39:28,675 --> 01:39:31,872
Yes, but what were you doing
at the second murder?

1179
01:39:32,445 --> 01:39:33,605
Hmm?

1180
01:39:36,349 --> 01:39:38,647
Let me help you with a thought.

1181
01:39:39,452 --> 01:39:43,684
You say that I forced you to come along,
and if I'm not here,

1182
01:39:43,790 --> 01:39:46,554
more specifically,
my body is not here to say otherwise,

1183
01:39:46,659 --> 01:39:49,924
you might have a chance
at just beating the rap.

1184
01:39:50,029 --> 01:39:53,726
You're probably asking yourself,
"Why would I help you?"

1185
01:39:53,833 --> 01:39:56,802
Well, I am tired, Mr. Smith.

1186
01:39:56,903 --> 01:39:59,394
I'm tired of killing, but I'm an addict.
I can't quit.

1187
01:39:59,505 --> 01:40:04,442
I've tried, but I cannot do it on my own,
so I need you to kill me.

1188
01:40:04,544 --> 01:40:06,705
But I need for you to do it smart,
all right?

1189
01:40:06,813 --> 01:40:11,546
In a way that I disappear
and my family never knows what I was.

1190
01:40:13,987 --> 01:40:16,751
How? How do I fucking do that?

1191
01:40:20,827 --> 01:40:23,227
There's a cemetery I know about.

1192
01:40:25,765 --> 01:40:31,397
We find an open grave. You shoot me.
I fall into the grave.

1193
01:40:32,572 --> 01:40:35,040
You shovel in just enough earth
to cover me.

1194
01:40:35,141 --> 01:40:40,579
Tomorrow, a casket is lowered onto me
and I've disappeared.

1195
01:40:40,680 --> 01:40:42,773
It's a good plan, don't you think?

1196
01:40:45,752 --> 01:40:48,585
Why? Why should I trust you?

1197
01:40:50,857 --> 01:40:54,486
You don't have to trust me, Mr. Smith.
You're the man holding the gun.

1198
01:40:54,594 --> 01:40:57,461
You saw me put mine in the trunk.
Remember?

1199
01:41:02,301 --> 01:41:03,825
I don't know.

1200
01:41:05,505 --> 01:41:07,803
You really want me to kill you?

1201
01:41:10,910 --> 01:41:11,968
Yes.

1202
01:41:14,981 --> 01:41:17,040
Okay. Okay.

1203
01:41:18,785 --> 01:41:21,117
But one sudden move

1204
01:41:22,288 --> 01:41:27,191
and I drop you, and I make sure
that your family knows what you are.

1205
01:41:30,997 --> 01:41:32,521
I understand.

1206
01:41:43,543 --> 01:41:46,410
You've come down in the world,
Mr. Baffert.

1207
01:41:58,758 --> 01:42:01,659
Take your hand
out of your pocket real slow.

1208
01:42:05,364 --> 01:42:07,264
You don't want to climb over, do you?

1209
01:42:07,366 --> 01:42:10,460
What are you doing
with the key to a cemetery?

1210
01:42:10,570 --> 01:42:11,798
I own it.

1211
01:42:13,573 --> 01:42:15,097
Why do you own a cemetery?

1212
01:42:15,208 --> 01:42:18,336
Well, you always want to invest in things
that people can't do without.

1213
01:42:18,444 --> 01:42:21,504
Water and cemeteries? Pretty safe bets.

1214
01:42:26,819 --> 01:42:30,414
Here, you'll need this to get out.

1215
01:44:02,548 --> 01:44:03,776
Fuck!

1216
01:44:07,720 --> 01:44:08,778
Fuck!

1217
01:44:14,293 --> 01:44:15,658
Hey, Atwood!

1218
01:44:17,163 --> 01:44:19,154
I want to show you something.

1219
01:44:43,389 --> 01:44:44,356
Okay.

1220
01:44:46,259 --> 01:44:47,783
There we are.

1221
01:44:53,532 --> 01:44:54,658
Okay.

1222
01:44:55,134 --> 01:45:00,902
Now, if I stand here and you stand there...
Not...

1223
01:45:01,240 --> 01:45:05,734
Not too far away, and you shoot me,
I should...

1224
01:45:06,913 --> 01:45:10,041
I should fall straight back into this hole.

1225
01:45:13,185 --> 01:45:16,621
You don't think I have the guts to do this,
do you?

1226
01:45:16,722 --> 01:45:20,715
No, I'm hoping you do, Mr. Smith.
I'm hoping you do.

1227
01:45:22,862 --> 01:45:24,693
Okay, let's...

1228
01:45:26,899 --> 01:45:28,924
Let's get this over with.

1229
01:45:41,113 --> 01:45:42,910
I'll close my eyes.

1230
01:46:08,240 --> 01:46:10,140
I'm sorry, Mr. Smith.

1231
01:46:13,713 --> 01:46:16,147
I really did want you to kill me.

1232
01:46:17,283 --> 01:46:22,016
But in case at the last minute
I changed my mind,

1233
01:46:22,121 --> 01:46:27,684
I returned to your apartment
and I bent the firing pin on your gun.

1234
01:46:30,396 --> 01:46:35,163
In fact, I even brought another one
for you to use so you could finish me,

1235
01:46:35,267 --> 01:46:38,100
if I had decided to go through with it.

1236
01:46:39,672 --> 01:46:43,608
Unfortunately for you,
my daughter's pregnant.

1237
01:46:43,709 --> 01:46:46,234
And just before you pulled that trigger,

1238
01:46:46,345 --> 01:46:50,372
I realized how much
I want to see the end of that story.

1239
01:46:51,417 --> 01:46:52,714
Don't do this to me.

1240
01:46:52,818 --> 01:46:56,083
If you touch even a hair on my head,
the cops are going to find those pictures.

1241
01:46:56,188 --> 01:46:59,055
And they're going to know
that you killed that couple.

1242
01:46:59,392 --> 01:47:02,828
The contents of your safety deposit box,
Mr. Smith,

1243
01:47:05,664 --> 01:47:07,131
have vanished.

1244
01:47:11,670 --> 01:47:13,467
It hurts, doesn't it?

1245
01:47:14,273 --> 01:47:16,298
Help me!

1246
01:47:40,866 --> 01:47:45,428
Before I was the Thumbprint Killer,
Mr. Smith,

1247
01:47:45,538 --> 01:47:50,032
I killed a lot of people
in a lot of different ways.

1248
01:48:18,104 --> 01:48:19,264
Thank you.

1249
01:48:33,719 --> 01:48:36,847
It says there
that the Thumbprint Killer is a monster.

1250
01:48:38,557 --> 01:48:42,186
Annoys you a little bit
you can't take credit, doesn't it?

1251
01:48:42,294 --> 01:48:47,288
No. Anyone who's good
at what they do wants credit,

1252
01:48:47,399 --> 01:48:54,100
but since I'm not going to do it anymore,
I will let Mr. Smith have the credit.

1253
01:48:55,908 --> 01:48:58,741
Don't kid yourself, Earl.
You're going to kill again.

1254
01:48:58,844 --> 01:49:00,641
No, I'm not.

1255
01:49:01,380 --> 01:49:05,373
I'm going back to the AA meetings,
and I will control it.

1256
01:49:15,294 --> 01:49:17,785
But there is an answer
I would like to have.

1257
01:49:22,835 --> 01:49:25,702
<i>- Atwood.
- Why are you a cop?</i>

1258
01:49:25,905 --> 01:49:27,031
Who is this?

1259
01:49:27,773 --> 01:49:30,401
You're rich. You have a good education.

1260
01:49:30,509 --> 01:49:32,170
You could have gone
into your father's business.

1261
01:49:32,278 --> 01:49:36,339
Instead you went outside all of that
and became successful on your own. Why?

1262
01:49:36,849 --> 01:49:38,248
If you want something from me,

1263
01:49:38,350 --> 01:49:40,978
then you're going to have to tell me
who you are or I'm going to hang up.

1264
01:49:41,687 --> 01:49:44,019
Did you think your husband's killing
was random?

1265
01:49:45,090 --> 01:49:47,752
<i>And I certainly didn't have to
give you Meeks.</i>

1266
01:49:48,060 --> 01:49:49,584
Mr. Baffert?

1267
01:49:50,396 --> 01:49:53,991
<i>- What's the answer?
- You don't sound like you.</i>

1268
01:49:55,668 --> 01:49:57,465
Well, I have a little cold.

1269
01:49:57,970 --> 01:50:01,406
<i>- Are you going to give me the answer?
- Where are you?</i>

1270
01:50:02,041 --> 01:50:06,068
I'll tell you, if you can give me
the true answer to my question.

1271
01:50:17,957 --> 01:50:23,122
My father was very disappointed that
I was born a girl and he let me know it.

1272
01:50:25,030 --> 01:50:27,897
I've spent my whole life
trying to prove him wrong.

1273
01:50:30,102 --> 01:50:31,330
Thank you.

1274
01:50:31,971 --> 01:50:35,134
Wait!
You promised to tell me where you are.

1275
01:50:35,574 --> 01:50:36,541
<i>Me?</i>

1276
01:50:38,677 --> 01:50:40,702
I'm on top of a building.

1277
01:50:46,919 --> 01:50:48,648
That wasn't Baffert.

1278
01:52:40,833 --> 01:52:42,198
Oh, Jane.

1279
01:52:43,569 --> 01:52:44,536
Jane.

1280
01:53:20,739 --> 01:53:21,933
<i>Jane!</i>

1281
01:53:23,942 --> 01:53:24,909
<i>Jane!</i>

1282
01:53:25,043 --> 01:53:26,340
Earl, honey, wake up.

1283
01:53:26,478 --> 01:53:27,536
Wake up.

1284
01:53:29,715 --> 01:53:30,682
You were dreaming.

1285
01:53:32,484 --> 01:53:36,921
Oh, Emma. I was... I woke you up.

1286
01:53:37,523 --> 01:53:40,424
It's okay. It's okay.

1287
01:53:42,394 --> 01:53:45,522
- Oh, God.
- I'm here. Go back to sleep.

1288
01:53:51,270 --> 01:53:54,398
<i>Why do you fight it so hard,
Earl?</i>

1289
01:53:54,506 --> 01:53:58,943
God, grant me the serenity
to accept the things I cannot change,

1290
01:53:59,044 --> 01:54:03,208
courage to change the things I can,
and wisdom to know the difference.

1291
01:54:03,949 --> 01:54:06,349
Living one day at a time
and enjoying one moment at a time,

1292
01:54:06,452 --> 01:54:08,647
accepting hardships
as the pathway to peace.

1293
01:54:08,754 --> 01:54:12,986
Taking, as He did, this sinful world
as it is and not as I would have it,

1294
01:54:13,091 --> 01:54:16,356
trusting that He will make all things
right if I surrender to His will,

1295
01:54:16,462 --> 01:54:18,987
that I may be reasonably happy in this life,

1296
01:54:19,097 --> 01:54:23,227
and supremely happy with Him
forever in the next. Amen.

1297
01:54:24,228 --> 01:54:26,228
Vtg
