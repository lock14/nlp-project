00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:56,325
<i>Look at me.</i>

3
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:57,743
<i>Look at the kite.</i>

4
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:16,553
<i>Jack...</i>

5
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:10,292
Oh, I've seen that outfit before.

6
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:12,669
I can't remember when.

7
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:15,464
- Last night.
- Last night!

8
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:18,383
These things do return.

9
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:22,346
God, my head is still pounding
like a drum.

10
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:23,972
You party hard.

11
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,392
Yeah, well, you don't look
worse than I am.

12
00:04:27,643 --> 00:04:29,436
I didn't drink as much as you.

13
00:04:29,645 --> 00:04:31,396
History of my life, Sara.

14
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,108
Psychiatrist by day,
party animal by night.

15
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:37,736
I thought you've told me
you were a lawyer.

16
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:39,613
I'm not, yet.

17
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:43,867
Excuse me.

18
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:47,621
<i>- Yeah.
- Hey, Jack. It's Shelly.</i>

19
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:50,958
<i>- I've been calling all morning. You OK?
- I'm Ok. What's up?</i>

20
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:51,959
I was worried.

21
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:54,711
You worry too much, Shelly.
What's going on?

22
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:57,381
Frank Parks is been calling.
He needs to speak with you immediately.

23
00:04:57,589 --> 00:04:59,132
Pass him through.

24
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:04,596
I had fun last night,
Miss. Pollard.

25
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:06,139
Me too.

26
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,934
Thanks for the wine tasting,
Dr. Gramm.

27
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,519
Jack.

28
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:14,898
<i>Hey, Jack, I've got Frank Parks.
Go ahead.</i>

29
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:16,984
- Hey, Frank.
- Jack.

30
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:19,570
We got another one.

31
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,655
Oh, no. The same?

32
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:22,781
<i>Every detail.</i>

33
00:05:23,574 --> 00:05:25,284
Right down
to the lateral laceration.

34
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:31,206
<i>It's the Seattle slayer again.</i>

35
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:33,417
<i>- Where are you now?
- Look, Jack.</i>

36
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:35,419
<i>There's a tape.</i>

37
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:37,421
You're gonna wanna see it.

38
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:41,175
<i>Jack, are you still there?</i>

39
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:44,094
Yeah.

40
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:51,018
Meet me at my office, okay?

41
00:05:51,185 --> 00:05:52,686
<i>Sure, Jack.</i>

42
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,293
Where to?

43
00:06:16,502 --> 00:06:18,921
114 Western, please.
Quickly.

44
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:27,846
<i>Welcome back, Seattle.</i>

45
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:30,933
<i>We're continuing our interview
with John Forster...</i>

46
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:34,520
<i>who was convicted for the death
of Janie Kay, nine years ago...</i>

47
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:38,857
<i>based on the eyewitness testimony
of her twin sister, Janie Kay.</i>

48
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:42,277
<i>John Forster was dated to die at
midnight, at Walla Walla Penitentiary.</i>

49
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,029
<i>- Do you mind changing it?
- John Forster.</i>

50
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:45,822
<i>What's your reaction
to the State...</i>

51
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:49,743
Thank you.

52
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:01,213
Idiot!

53
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,123
Congratulations!

54
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,084
For what?

55
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:42,504
I was referring to the hottie that
you left with the party last night.

56
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:44,006
She was a quite piece of ass.

57
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:46,800
- Remember her name?
- Yes, I do.

58
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:48,343
Sara Pollard.

59
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:51,805
Is that a cut on your nose?
You didn't have that before I left.

60
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:54,558
I fell out of the bed.
FBI hit here yet?

61
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:57,603
- Yeah, 2 minutes in the conference room.
- Okay.

62
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,479
Any calls?

63
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:01,732
New York Times, Washington times,
Newsweek.

64
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:05,152
They all wanna know if you have a quote
about Forster's execution.

65
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:08,155
- What else is new?
- Kim Cummings called twice.

66
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:10,824
- She was worried about you too.
- Kim knows this procedure.

67
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:13,535
Apparently not.
She's in your office.

68
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:16,163
Jack Gramm Associates.

69
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:19,291
I put those case reports
you wanna me to look at on your desk.

70
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:23,212
I thought Lauren and Leeza showed
real insight and ability.

71
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,297
The others were pretty much
working the math.

72
00:08:25,464 --> 00:08:26,507
Yeah.

73
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:33,138
Don't you have Federal Agents
waiting for you?

74
00:08:35,224 --> 00:08:36,058
Yeah.

75
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:38,018
I' see you in class.

76
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:40,896
I'll take them trough today's work
if you run late.

77
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:42,397
Thanks.

78
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:44,483
- Thank you, Kim.
- Bye.

79
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:50,656
Janie Keith came by
to give you a present.

80
00:08:51,073 --> 00:08:52,407
Dr. Gramm.

81
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:54,701
I'm sorry.
I don't know if this is appropriate...

82
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:56,203
I just wanted to...

83
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:59,039
I just wanted to mark the day.

84
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:00,415
Thank you, Janie.

85
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:04,753
I'm glad that my sister Janie
hasn't been forgotten. Thank you.

86
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:08,131
For everything.
You went out of your way.

87
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:11,969
You are busy, so I'm just...
I'm gonna get out of here.

88
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:15,806
We did good, Janie.
We did good.

89
00:09:15,931 --> 00:09:17,140
All right.

90
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:18,600
Thanks.

91
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,273
Can I help you?

92
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:26,066
You are one of my students?

93
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:27,568
Hi.

94
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,611
- Jack.
- Yeah.

95
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:33,532
I'd like to introduce you to Jeremy
Goober, with attorney general office.

96
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:36,785
Jeremy is in charge
of the Seattle slayer task force.

97
00:09:36,869 --> 00:09:40,789
Dr. Gramm, it's so good to meet you.
This is a really big honor for me.

98
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:42,124
Sorry about the...

99
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:44,209
Oh, this is such a beautiful
conference room too.

100
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:46,920
And this special agent
MacTire from the FBI.

101
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:48,213
Dr. Gramm.

102
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:50,424
Pleasure. Have a seat.

103
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:53,886
Hey, big fellow?

104
00:09:54,136 --> 00:09:55,137
Yes.

105
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:57,973
Jeremy.

106
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:02,811
Seattle slayer task force.

107
00:10:02,853 --> 00:10:07,149
Well, okay.
I'm sure you have a lot of questions.

108
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:11,862
I'll do the best I can to answer them,
but first I...

109
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:17,075
No. First I think we should all
have a cookie.

110
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:22,289
These are from Janie Kay, whose sister,
Janie was murdered by John Forster.

111
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:25,209
- Jeremy?
- Sure, thank you.

112
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:29,755
- Frank?
- No, thanks, Jack.

113
00:10:30,047 --> 00:10:31,256
No?

114
00:10:31,757 --> 00:10:33,217
Mr. MacTire?

115
00:10:35,052 --> 00:10:36,803
You are a good sport, Jeremy.

116
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:39,765
A little milk maybe,
what do you think?

117
00:10:43,727 --> 00:10:47,356
Shelley, we got milk, don't we?
Bring in three glasses.

118
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:49,233
Nothing for me, Jack.

119
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,151
All right, make that two.

120
00:10:51,235 --> 00:10:52,736
No, make it three.

121
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,405
Maybe you have a change of heart.

122
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,492
So, let's see...

123
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:01,411
I can assume...

124
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:04,706
that last night crime scene...

125
00:11:04,748 --> 00:11:08,085
was very much like
Forster's previous crime scene, right?

126
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:10,462
- They totally match, yeah.
- What totally matches?

127
00:11:12,256 --> 00:11:14,132
I have in here...

128
00:11:20,264 --> 00:11:22,891
- Halothane on the breath.
- Subdued by Halothane.

129
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,643
- Rape.
- Yeah.

130
00:11:24,977 --> 00:11:27,020
The body was hung up side down.

131
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:28,021
Yes.

132
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:29,273
And...

133
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:33,610
slashed throat.

134
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:38,115
- And where this takes us?
- Looks like a copy cat.

135
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:41,326
- It could be. Maybe
- Could be? Maybe?

136
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:44,663
- Maybe.
- It's a stage scene. Maybe what?

137
00:11:44,872 --> 00:11:47,332
Maybe,
and this might be far-fetched...

138
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:50,460
but what if the perp
worked with Forster...

139
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:54,882
and these stage scenes were intended to
throw some doubts on his guilty verdict?

140
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:57,384
- Go with it.
- Possibly providing him...

141
00:11:57,467 --> 00:12:00,929
with a stay of execution
or even a new trial.

142
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:04,766
Goal star, Jeremy.
Big goal star.

143
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:07,519
I mean, that's exactly what I think
is happening here.

144
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:10,939
No, I'm sticking with copy cat.

145
00:12:11,148 --> 00:12:13,609
Of course there is
another possibility.

146
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:15,736
- Yeah?
- Forster is innocent.

147
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:17,446
- Wrongly convicted.
- No!

148
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:19,281
The task force is aware...

149
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:22,492
that your expert opinion
was critical in convicting Forster.

150
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:24,494
But then why he walked
his first trial?

151
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:25,871
Procedural error.

152
00:12:26,038 --> 00:12:29,082
Why is he never been tried in any
of the other five pending murderers...

153
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,126
that you've attributed to him?

154
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:35,464
You realize that it is the dude of my
office to ensure that an innocent man...

155
00:12:35,506 --> 00:12:38,509
is not executed tonight.
You do understand that?

156
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:43,055
Look, Jack. If you have
any reconsideration of testimony...

157
00:12:43,305 --> 00:12:45,641
or anything new you wanna lay
on the table...

158
00:12:45,849 --> 00:12:47,226
now it would be the time.

159
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:48,936
Would you say it was fair
to characterize...

160
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:50,354
your attitude towards
John Forster...

161
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:54,691
- as a personal vendetta?
- Lf we're been fair, yeah, sure.

162
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:58,278
It's a personal vendetta. I have
a personal vendetta against Ted Bundy...

163
00:12:58,529 --> 00:13:02,115
and Gacy and about 10 or 15
other serial murders...

164
00:13:02,324 --> 00:13:04,409
- that are on the streets right now.
- Jack, please.

165
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:05,744
That's helpful.

166
00:13:06,662 --> 00:13:09,081
There is one other issue
that we need to address.

167
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:10,791
Milk maid.

168
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:28,934
What's going on here?

169
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:32,104
Do you know a woman named
Dale Morris?

170
00:13:32,521 --> 00:13:33,730
Yes.

171
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:35,440
How?

172
00:13:35,941 --> 00:13:38,902
- She's a student of mine.
- She's just a student of yours?

173
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:43,156
Dr. Gramm, we're federal agency here.
You don't wanna be lying here.

174
00:13:43,407 --> 00:13:46,869
- We had a relationship.
- You've been very cryptic right now?

175
00:13:47,202 --> 00:13:51,248
He had a professional relationship,
not a sexual relationship.

176
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:55,002
About a year ago her father died.
She was very troubled.

177
00:13:55,252 --> 00:13:58,213
I treated her as psychiatrist.

178
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:01,258
I don't sleep with my students,
Mr. Goober.

179
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:03,719
Neither I sleep with my patients.

180
00:14:04,803 --> 00:14:09,016
Now what does this have to do
with anything? Anyway.

181
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:10,767
Jack.

182
00:14:11,185 --> 00:14:13,604
Dale Morris was murdered
last night.

183
00:14:13,854 --> 00:14:15,898
She's the third and latest victim.

184
00:14:19,276 --> 00:14:21,486
When was the last time
you saw Dale?

185
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:24,031
Well...

186
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:25,991
I saw...

187
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:31,955
I saw her last night.

188
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,960
To our impossibly
difficult professor.

189
00:14:37,503 --> 00:14:39,671
We say thank you...

190
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:43,091
for making our lives miserable.

191
00:14:43,842 --> 00:14:45,552
The pleasure is all mine.

192
00:14:54,311 --> 00:14:55,437
We're celebrating.

193
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:57,648
You're celebrating
Forster's pending execution?

194
00:14:58,649 --> 00:15:04,363
No, we're celebrating his conviction,
not his execution.

195
00:15:04,947 --> 00:15:08,867
It was an overturn so we're happy
about that. We worked hard on this case.

196
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:11,995
We have a tape
that was left on the crime scene.

197
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:15,649
We're gonna play it for you now.

198
00:15:17,376 --> 00:15:20,671
<i>This message is for
Dr. Jack Gramm.</i>

199
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:25,592
<i>You got the wrong man.</i>

200
00:15:25,843 --> 00:15:27,219
<i>Forster is innocent.</i>

201
00:15:27,302 --> 00:15:29,680
<i>Please, don't hurt me anymore.</i>

202
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:32,099
<i>Don't hurt me anymore.</i>

203
00:15:33,392 --> 00:15:35,477
<i>You gonna let me go, right?</i>

204
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:40,732
<i>You said you'd let me go.
I've read what you want me and...</i>

205
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:55,163
Jack, it goes like that for about
an hour, before she dies.

206
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:58,500
Why do you think she was reading you
that message, Dr. Gramm?

207
00:16:05,257 --> 00:16:06,466
Dr. Gramm?

208
00:16:06,884 --> 00:16:08,260
Dr. Gramm?

209
00:16:08,552 --> 00:16:10,179
<i>In Dr. Gramm own words...</i>

210
00:16:10,262 --> 00:16:12,514
<i>he analyzes a mental puzzle.</i>

211
00:16:12,764 --> 00:16:15,559
<i>So they're no actual tangible pieces
per say.</i>

212
00:16:16,268 --> 00:16:18,270
<i>He made a guess based on what
happened to Kate.</i>

213
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:22,024
<i>A guess based on his intuition,
a personal bias, ego.</i>

214
00:16:22,232 --> 00:16:25,777
<i>And he sold that fiction lock, stock
and barrel to the jury.</i>

215
00:16:28,447 --> 00:16:30,032
What is it?

216
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:39,041
The girl that was killed
last night...

217
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:42,044
- was Dale Morris.
- Dale?

218
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:45,506
Oh, my God.

219
00:16:47,049 --> 00:16:49,510
Okay, let's see...

220
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:52,888
We have our investigators coordinated
with the FBI...

221
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:58,352
I wanna know everything Dale Morris did
on the last 24 hours.

222
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,729
I wanna know where she went,
who she talked to.

223
00:17:00,938 --> 00:17:03,607
Can you please have Dr. Gramm's car
ready, please. Thank you.

224
00:17:05,943 --> 00:17:07,611
Thank you, Shelley.

225
00:17:07,945 --> 00:17:09,154
For what?

226
00:17:10,614 --> 00:17:13,659
- I don't know. For everything.
- I hate when you do this, Jack.

227
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:16,411
Every time you o this,
I think you gonna end up dead.

228
00:17:18,956 --> 00:17:21,250
Just don't ask me to marry you
again.

229
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,126
Why not?
We're perfect for each other.

230
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:27,214
Yeah, yeah. Except that I'm gay
and you're commitment phobe.

231
00:17:27,422 --> 00:17:29,424
That's why we're perfect.

232
00:17:31,343 --> 00:17:33,011
Thanks, baby.

233
00:17:35,514 --> 00:17:38,851
<i>Dr. Gramm is a world known expert
in forensic psychiatry.</i>

234
00:17:39,142 --> 00:17:41,770
<i>What is forensic psychiatry?</i>

235
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:45,274
<i>I mean, is not the same profession
that destroyed MacMorton's life...</i>

236
00:17:45,357 --> 00:17:48,193
<i>by conjuring up images
of child molestation?</i>

237
00:17:48,402 --> 00:17:51,697
<i>None of the charges were ever proved.
And the accused, though innocent...</i>

238
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:53,031
<i>was public crucified.</i>

239
00:18:18,182 --> 00:18:20,350
<i>Jack, look. Look at the kite.</i>

240
00:18:23,353 --> 00:18:24,855
<i>Jack, come here.</i>

241
00:19:16,031 --> 00:19:17,199
Yeah?

242
00:19:18,075 --> 00:19:19,576
Hello?

243
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:23,747
Hello?

244
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:26,250
<i>You have 88 minutes to live.</i>

245
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:27,167
What?

246
00:19:27,251 --> 00:19:29,628
<i>You know how long 88 minutes can be,
don't you?</i>

247
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:32,047
<i>- That's 11:45 am.
- Who is this?</i>

248
00:19:32,256 --> 00:19:34,049
<i>- Tic-tac.
- Who the hell is this?</i>

249
00:19:34,258 --> 00:19:35,676
<i>Tic-tac.</i>

250
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,262
What were you saying?

251
00:19:53,735 --> 00:19:55,988
<i>- Jack Gramm Associates.
- Shelley?</i>

252
00:19:56,154 --> 00:19:58,448
I want you to set a trap and
and a trace on my cell.

253
00:19:58,615 --> 00:19:59,366
<i>What's going on?</i>

254
00:19:59,449 --> 00:20:02,578
I want you to contact
a wireless carrier...

255
00:20:02,661 --> 00:20:05,163
and have them find out who made
that last phone call to me.

256
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:07,207
<i>- Jack, I could be more helpful if...
- Just do it.</i>

257
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:08,792
Just do it. I need it, all right?

258
00:20:08,876 --> 00:20:10,878
<i>And call me when you get it.</i>

259
00:20:11,962 --> 00:20:16,800
John Forster was an Eagle Scout, which
counts for his facility with ropes.

260
00:20:17,009 --> 00:20:19,219
He also worked
in a veterinary office...

261
00:20:19,428 --> 00:20:22,598
where he had experience using
the animal tranquilizer Halothane...

262
00:20:22,806 --> 00:20:24,349
witch he's used to subdue
his victims.

263
00:20:24,433 --> 00:20:29,104
Halothane. Sorry, I'm late again.
Thank you, Kim.

264
00:20:29,855 --> 00:20:33,942
I see that the size of our class
is dwindling once again.

265
00:20:34,026 --> 00:20:36,236
It could be because
you keep booting everyone.

266
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:39,364
My favorite student, Mike Stempt.

267
00:20:41,491 --> 00:20:46,872
Okay. The legal distinction between
sanity and insanity rests upon what?

268
00:20:47,122 --> 00:20:50,209
- Free will.
- The concept of the free will.

269
00:20:50,501 --> 00:20:53,462
And what is
the most important thing...

270
00:20:53,629 --> 00:20:55,964
one should remember
when entering a court-room?

271
00:20:56,215 --> 00:21:00,177
That insanity it's a legal concept.
It's not a medical or psychiatric term.

272
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,429
But despite the fact that insanity
is a legal concept...

273
00:21:02,513 --> 00:21:04,139
it doesn't mean
that someone is not sick.

274
00:21:04,181 --> 00:21:05,182
Yes, Lauren.

275
00:21:05,641 --> 00:21:08,519
Of all the serial killers
that I've interviewed and studied...

276
00:21:08,602 --> 00:21:12,648
witch include our boy Bundy,
Dahmer, Gacy...

277
00:21:12,689 --> 00:21:15,150
none of them was legally insane.

278
00:21:15,526 --> 00:21:17,277
This is not saying
that they were normal.

279
00:21:17,486 --> 00:21:19,196
I could argue that
they couldn't help themselves...

280
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:20,822
precisely because of
their mental disorder.

281
00:21:20,864 --> 00:21:23,158
Well, if you wanna argue, Mike...

282
00:21:23,367 --> 00:21:25,160
school of law is across campus.

283
00:21:25,244 --> 00:21:26,787
Come on, Dr. Gramm.

284
00:21:26,995 --> 00:21:30,165
It's ingenuous to pretend that
our presentations are not arguments.

285
00:21:30,457 --> 00:21:32,543
We create a narrative of the crime
and the criminal.

286
00:21:32,626 --> 00:21:35,379
Narrative is based on facts.
Based on logic.

287
00:21:35,629 --> 00:21:38,757
We don't walk into a court-room
and advocate set scenes, do we?

288
00:21:39,216 --> 00:21:43,178
We don't take sides.
We check our views at the door.

289
00:21:43,554 --> 00:21:45,722
You mean you want us to pretend
we don't have an opinion?

290
00:21:45,806 --> 00:21:48,517
We have opinions, Lauren,
but we just keep them to ourselves.

291
00:21:48,725 --> 00:21:50,894
Share them with your dog,
if you have to.

292
00:21:51,103 --> 00:21:53,397
Not with your parrot,
because it talks back.

293
00:21:54,231 --> 00:21:57,401
It is that kind of logic that's gonna
get you in a law school across campus.

294
00:21:57,484 --> 00:21:58,777
I've been there. I've done that.

295
00:21:59,027 --> 00:22:00,988
Well, my condolences.

296
00:22:02,322 --> 00:22:04,241
So, where is...

297
00:22:04,491 --> 00:22:07,578
Dale Morris? She's absent.
I don't see her.

298
00:22:10,372 --> 00:22:11,999
That's her first.

299
00:22:15,961 --> 00:22:17,421
I didn't take her for a quitter.

300
00:22:19,173 --> 00:22:23,343
Anyone who has her phone number,
please, contact me after class.

301
00:22:27,306 --> 00:22:28,849
Okay.

302
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:31,101
Excuse me.

303
00:22:33,937 --> 00:22:34,688
Shelley.

304
00:22:34,771 --> 00:22:39,026
<i>Tick-Tack, doc.
You have 83 minutes to live, Dr. Gramm.</i>

305
00:22:40,444 --> 00:22:42,070
<i>Tick-Tack, doc.</i>

306
00:22:53,457 --> 00:22:55,375
So where was I?

307
00:22:55,584 --> 00:22:57,419
Bundy versus Forster.

308
00:22:57,628 --> 00:22:59,838
- What?
- Bundy versus Forster.

309
00:23:01,006 --> 00:23:02,216
Thank you, Lauren.

310
00:23:05,594 --> 00:23:06,553
You're welcome.

311
00:23:09,306 --> 00:23:13,936
What we're gonna explore today is
the similarities and dissimilarities...

312
00:23:14,144 --> 00:23:19,358
say, from Ted Bundy's motives,
let's compared them to John Forster's.

313
00:23:25,239 --> 00:23:27,282
Dr. Gramm,
your phone is ringing.

314
00:23:34,665 --> 00:23:37,125
<i>- Jack, are you there?
- Shelley. What's going on?</i>

315
00:23:37,167 --> 00:23:38,919
The call was made
from a cell phone.

316
00:23:39,002 --> 00:23:41,088
One of those you buy
and pay minutes for it.

317
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,297
Registered to whom?

318
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:45,425
- Look, I know you're in class, but...
- Yes, who is registered to it?

319
00:23:47,845 --> 00:23:48,720
A Kate Gramm.

320
00:23:53,183 --> 00:23:56,061
Jack, it's a common name.
It doesn't have to be your sister.

321
00:23:56,144 --> 00:23:57,104
It's just a coincidence.

322
00:23:59,273 --> 00:24:00,440
It's not a coincidence.

323
00:24:03,527 --> 00:24:06,405
- It's not a coincidence.
- Jack, I'm loosing you.

324
00:24:06,655 --> 00:24:08,282
Shelley?
Goddamn it!

325
00:24:08,907 --> 00:24:09,783
Shelley?

326
00:24:09,867 --> 00:24:12,744
<i>Have you found out who my phone
is registered to by now?</i>

327
00:24:13,036 --> 00:24:16,498
<i>Poor Kate. If it was Kate,
you'd like to call her?</i>

328
00:24:16,707 --> 00:24:19,126
I'm gonna find you, you here that,
you son-of-a-bitch?

329
00:24:19,376 --> 00:24:21,837
You're barking up the wrong tree
on this one.

330
00:24:22,045 --> 00:24:23,422
I'm gonna find you.

331
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:25,757
<i>She suffered
for such a long time.</i>

332
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:28,510
<i>You remember how long,
don't you?</i>

333
00:24:29,178 --> 00:24:31,013
<i>You still feel guilty about her?</i>

334
00:24:31,722 --> 00:24:34,725
<i>You feel guilty about
falsifying the evidence?</i>

335
00:24:34,766 --> 00:24:36,977
<i>For lying under oath?</i>

336
00:24:37,186 --> 00:24:40,772
<i>Tic-tac, doc.
You have 79 minutes to live.</i>

337
00:25:11,929 --> 00:25:13,931
Do you find this funny, Albert?

338
00:25:14,097 --> 00:25:15,933
Who were you calling on
your phone?

339
00:25:17,434 --> 00:25:18,894
Let me see your phone.

340
00:25:19,269 --> 00:25:20,604
I was just...

341
00:25:20,854 --> 00:25:22,231
Let me see that goddamn it phone.

342
00:25:22,272 --> 00:25:23,732
I was just checking
the Mariners score.

343
00:25:23,774 --> 00:25:25,901
- You were what?
- I was checking the Mariners score.

344
00:25:26,151 --> 00:25:27,819
Okay, what is the score?

345
00:25:29,404 --> 00:25:30,405
The score.

346
00:25:30,697 --> 00:25:32,366
What's the damn score?

347
00:25:34,368 --> 00:25:36,870
It's 3 x 1 Mariners.
B1.

348
00:26:10,821 --> 00:26:13,574
- Oh, my God, I can't believe it.
- What does it mean? What's the problem?

349
00:26:13,657 --> 00:26:14,992
Look.

350
00:26:15,075 --> 00:26:15,951
What?

351
00:26:16,785 --> 00:26:17,870
What's going on here?

352
00:26:17,953 --> 00:26:20,831
It says that Dale Morris was murdered
last night.

353
00:26:21,415 --> 00:26:24,126
- Is that true, Dr. Gramm?
- Yeah.

354
00:26:24,418 --> 00:26:27,462
You knew it?
You knew it and you didn't tell us?

355
00:26:27,671 --> 00:26:30,716
- You knew and asked for Dale's number?
- Is it the slayer?

356
00:26:30,966 --> 00:26:32,843
- It could be.
- It could be?

357
00:26:33,093 --> 00:26:35,220
Well, the police haven't released
any information yet.

358
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:37,848
- Are we all in danger?
- I can't believe you didn't tell us.

359
00:26:38,056 --> 00:26:40,517
- Dr. Gramm?
- Lynn Johnson.

360
00:26:40,684 --> 00:26:42,311
Someone just called
a bomb threat.

361
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:45,647
Everyone is to evacuate the building
immediately. Thank you.

362
00:26:45,731 --> 00:26:47,900
Come on.
Grab your stuff.

363
00:26:48,108 --> 00:26:50,736
I'll get your papers
of presentation, Tom.

364
00:26:50,944 --> 00:26:52,654
I got the slides, Kim.

365
00:26:56,325 --> 00:27:00,746
<i>All students, faculty and staff
must evacuate the building.</i>

366
00:27:00,829 --> 00:27:04,041
<i>I repeat.
Everyone must evacuate the building.</i>

367
00:27:12,966 --> 00:27:17,304
<i>All students, faculty and staff
must evacuate the building.</i>

368
00:27:17,554 --> 00:27:20,724
<i>I repeat.
Everyone must evacuate the building.</i>

369
00:27:24,186 --> 00:27:27,064
<i>Please,
remain calm e do not run.</i>

370
00:27:27,147 --> 00:27:30,067
<i>Proceed to the door
to the end of the campus.</i>

371
00:27:30,567 --> 00:27:33,737
<i>I repeat.
We must evacuate the building.</i>

372
00:27:34,863 --> 00:27:37,699
Jack? What are you doing?
Get going.

373
00:27:39,243 --> 00:27:44,248
<i>All students, faculty and staff
must evacuate the building.</i>

374
00:27:45,123 --> 00:27:47,167
What was that on the screen?

375
00:27:47,751 --> 00:27:51,588
Some student playing a joke
or something.

376
00:27:52,089 --> 00:27:55,384
You of all people know that it breaks
school laws to proceed by a threat...

377
00:27:55,425 --> 00:27:58,554
you need to report this
to the campus security immediately.

378
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,599
Carol. I get threat like this,
three or four times a year.

379
00:28:02,683 --> 00:28:05,644
Your incredible arrogance
will slap the shit of you, Jack.

380
00:28:05,811 --> 00:28:08,230
I wish you'd disclosure
your true feelings about me...

381
00:28:08,272 --> 00:28:09,648
before we became
such good friends.

382
00:28:09,857 --> 00:28:12,401
Maybe you should stop hiding behind
your assessments about other people...

383
00:28:12,484 --> 00:28:13,527
and start assessing yourself...

384
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:15,571
cause you need to get over your past
and go on with your life...

385
00:28:15,612 --> 00:28:17,531
cause what you're living
isn't one.

386
00:28:17,698 --> 00:28:19,825
It is not what you tell
your patients?

387
00:28:21,034 --> 00:28:22,953
- Gum?
- Thank you.

388
00:28:23,287 --> 00:28:25,622
I'll call campus security and let
them know you're on your way.

389
00:28:25,706 --> 00:28:28,125
Where did you go last night?
When you left the bar.

390
00:28:30,711 --> 00:28:31,753
Home.

391
00:28:32,171 --> 00:28:33,881
Were you alone?

392
00:28:34,673 --> 00:28:36,592
Screw you.

393
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:56,653
Roger.
We're on it.

394
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:08,040
Yeah.

395
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:10,751
The press got a hold of Dale's name.
It's all over the news.

396
00:29:11,293 --> 00:29:12,836
Yeah, I know that.

397
00:29:14,087 --> 00:29:17,591
<i>And Forster's attorney is going
to the court and try a stay.</i>

398
00:29:18,008 --> 00:29:20,052
A stay?
On what grounds?

399
00:29:20,344 --> 00:29:21,678
They're claiming that these...

400
00:29:21,762 --> 00:29:24,306
murders prove that the real killer
have never been brought to justice.

401
00:29:24,556 --> 00:29:27,601
Nonsense. They're just trying
to buy time. They're desperate.

402
00:29:27,851 --> 00:29:31,355
They're also claiming that you falsify
testimony and concealed evidences.

403
00:29:31,563 --> 00:29:33,982
Well, it's all loose.
Goddamn it.

404
00:29:34,816 --> 00:29:36,777
Who is that guy?

405
00:29:39,905 --> 00:29:43,325
What about Dale Morris?
Did we find anymore of her?

406
00:29:43,492 --> 00:29:46,870
She was murdered
in her apartment...

407
00:29:46,954 --> 00:29:48,830
between the hours of two
and six am.

408
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:50,541
<i>- Any sign of force entry?
- No.</i>

409
00:29:50,874 --> 00:29:54,503
Does Forster still have that group
visiting him on prison?

410
00:29:55,128 --> 00:29:57,548
He's like a goddamn rock star.
Website and all.

411
00:29:57,798 --> 00:30:00,676
I want you to pull a background check
on all my students...

412
00:30:00,884 --> 00:30:02,427
and get back to me.

413
00:30:04,263 --> 00:30:05,013
Damn.

414
00:30:08,767 --> 00:30:09,768
Oh, no.

415
00:30:52,936 --> 00:30:54,271
Okay.

416
00:31:52,454 --> 00:31:54,790
Kim?
What are you doing here?

417
00:31:54,873 --> 00:31:56,625
I'm getting my car,
it's parked here...

418
00:31:56,708 --> 00:31:58,919
like it's every day
I come to the campus.

419
00:32:00,003 --> 00:32:04,132
That was really horrible.
Just horrible what you did in class...

420
00:32:04,216 --> 00:32:06,468
- it's was little low for you.
- I was looking for potential suspects.

421
00:32:06,677 --> 00:32:09,805
That's what I was doing. What did you do
after you left the party last night?

422
00:32:10,013 --> 00:32:12,933
I didn't end up drunk in bed
with an strange like you.

423
00:32:13,183 --> 00:32:17,020
You left the party with Dale Morris,
the girl that was murdered, didn't you?

424
00:32:18,021 --> 00:32:21,066
- Yes, I did.
- So what did you do? Where did you go?

425
00:32:21,942 --> 00:32:24,486
You're not seriously
considering...

426
00:32:25,821 --> 00:32:26,780
Where did you go?

427
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:29,616
We went to the Hickory Stick.
We had a drink, two drinks.

428
00:32:30,158 --> 00:32:32,619
- And then?
- And then I went home alone.

429
00:32:33,495 --> 00:32:36,957
- You have anyone that can verify that?
- No. No-one can verify it.

430
00:32:37,124 --> 00:32:38,584
Come on. I've been your
teaching assistant for two years.

431
00:32:38,667 --> 00:32:41,628
I'm your friend.
I'm here to help you, if you let me.

432
00:32:41,712 --> 00:32:43,172
Follow me.

433
00:32:46,258 --> 00:32:47,968
Follow me.

434
00:32:51,763 --> 00:32:53,223
Who did that?

435
00:32:54,516 --> 00:32:55,893
What does that mean?

436
00:32:55,976 --> 00:32:57,978
According to a anonymous
phone call...

437
00:32:58,061 --> 00:33:01,106
that means I have
72 minutes left to live.

438
00:33:01,315 --> 00:33:03,483
Can I borrow your cell phone?

439
00:33:03,692 --> 00:33:05,152
I've broke mine.

440
00:33:06,278 --> 00:33:07,362
These are my car keys.

441
00:33:07,446 --> 00:33:09,907
Can you take that around front
and meet me there in ten minutes?

442
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:13,160
- I have to go to the campus security.
- Okay.

443
00:33:13,243 --> 00:33:15,037
Call me on my Blackberry
if you run late.

444
00:33:15,579 --> 00:33:16,496
Okay.

445
00:33:18,248 --> 00:33:21,710
Shelley. You gonna have to reach me
on Kim's cell phone.

446
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:22,753
What happened to yours?

447
00:33:22,836 --> 00:33:24,630
<i>- I broke it.
- What?</i>

448
00:33:24,796 --> 00:33:26,048
<i>You have her number, don't you?</i>

449
00:33:26,423 --> 00:33:27,174
<i>Yeah, I do.</i>

450
00:33:27,257 --> 00:33:32,179
Listen, just forward all the calls,
okay, to Kim's cell.

451
00:33:33,096 --> 00:33:34,389
Please, thanks.

452
00:33:34,681 --> 00:33:36,141
Dr. Gramm.

453
00:33:36,725 --> 00:33:37,559
Hey, Mike.

454
00:33:39,603 --> 00:33:42,231
Everyone is pretty upset
about Dale.

455
00:33:42,397 --> 00:33:46,276
Yeah, well, that's understandable.
Considering the circumstances.

456
00:33:46,735 --> 00:33:48,570
I have a question about
John Forster.

457
00:33:48,862 --> 00:33:50,572
Yeah? What?

458
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:54,952
Well, I've been going through the trial
transcripts in Kate's history...

459
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,620
Why would you do that?

460
00:33:56,703 --> 00:34:00,499
To understand your process better.
How you come to your conclusions.

461
00:34:01,583 --> 00:34:02,543
And?

462
00:34:03,293 --> 00:34:04,545
What?

463
00:34:05,796 --> 00:34:08,465
Is it possible that Forster
is innocent?

464
00:34:08,549 --> 00:34:09,466
No.

465
00:34:09,883 --> 00:34:11,885
You won't even consider
the possibility?

466
00:34:11,969 --> 00:34:12,928
No.

467
00:34:13,136 --> 00:34:16,890
You're completely convinced the scenario
you put together is the only one?

468
00:34:17,057 --> 00:34:19,643
First of all,
I didn't put together a scenario.

469
00:34:20,102 --> 00:34:22,437
I recreated the crime scene.
Second...

470
00:34:22,646 --> 00:34:24,815
I didn't convict Forster.
A jury did.

471
00:34:24,898 --> 00:34:26,483
But the evidence
was circumstantial.

472
00:34:26,567 --> 00:34:28,360
No DNA, no murder weapon.

473
00:34:28,527 --> 00:34:32,030
Nothing directly linking Forster
to the crime, except your narrative...

474
00:34:32,197 --> 00:34:34,783
- and Janie Kay's testimony.
- What's your point?

475
00:34:35,409 --> 00:34:37,369
Just that your testimony
was very convincing.

476
00:34:37,661 --> 00:34:39,288
That's my job.

477
00:34:39,329 --> 00:34:41,039
To be convincing.

478
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:45,335
I thought it was to be right.

479
00:34:58,098 --> 00:34:59,641
<i>Help!</i>

480
00:35:01,268 --> 00:35:03,270
<i>Somebody, please!</i>

481
00:35:07,357 --> 00:35:08,483
<i>Help!</i>

482
00:35:08,734 --> 00:35:10,027
<i>Help!</i>

483
00:35:14,406 --> 00:35:15,490
- Lauren.
- Dr. Gramm.

484
00:35:15,532 --> 00:35:16,491
What happened to you?

485
00:35:16,533 --> 00:35:18,327
He's wearing a leather jacket.
He's out there.

486
00:35:18,535 --> 00:35:21,538
I bit his hand, it's bleeding.
If his hand is bloody, you can get him.

487
00:35:21,622 --> 00:35:24,875
- You're okay?
- Go get him now! I'm fine!

488
00:35:56,907 --> 00:35:59,201
- Watch my car!
- It's a police action!

489
00:35:59,451 --> 00:36:00,369
There's been an assault.

490
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:02,037
- I wanna see your hands.
- Back off!

491
00:36:02,246 --> 00:36:03,789
- Roll the window down.
- No!

492
00:36:03,956 --> 00:36:07,209
I'm a forensic psychiatric
with the FBI. Here.

493
00:36:07,459 --> 00:36:09,002
Okay?
Open the window now.

494
00:36:09,294 --> 00:36:11,672
- Yeah.
- See? Well, roll down the window...

495
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,675
and let me see your hands.
Let me see your hands.

496
00:36:14,883 --> 00:36:17,219
If you have nothing to hide,
you can show me.

497
00:36:17,261 --> 00:36:19,304
Look, I'm trying to go home.
What?

498
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:22,099
Okay, sorry.

499
00:36:28,689 --> 00:36:29,857
Excuse me.

500
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:32,401
There's been an assault.
I wanna see your hand.

501
00:36:39,658 --> 00:36:41,535
Okay. Be cool now!

502
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:44,872
There's been an assault.
I gotta check your hands.

503
00:36:45,122 --> 00:36:47,958
I'm a forensic psychiatric
with the FBI.

504
00:37:04,349 --> 00:37:05,767
Sorry.

505
00:37:14,985 --> 00:37:15,986
I couldn't find him.

506
00:37:16,778 --> 00:37:17,946
Here.

507
00:37:19,031 --> 00:37:20,782
This is stupid.

508
00:37:21,575 --> 00:37:22,659
I'm so stupid.

509
00:37:22,743 --> 00:37:25,954
- How I could be so weak? Such a wimp.
- It's not your fault. Come on.

510
00:37:26,038 --> 00:37:28,957
I can't believe I let him get away
like that. I should've fought back more.

511
00:37:29,041 --> 00:37:31,293
Stop beating yourself up?
What exactly happened?

512
00:37:31,502 --> 00:37:34,796
He came from behind. He put this rag
over my mouth and I bit his hand.

513
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,674
- The rag had an odor?
- Something sweet...

514
00:37:38,842 --> 00:37:40,135
It's Halothane, right?

515
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:42,471
- Yeah.
- He's the one.

516
00:37:43,138 --> 00:37:44,097
Probably.

517
00:37:44,389 --> 00:37:45,933
I let Dale's murderer get away.

518
00:37:46,016 --> 00:37:48,435
Stop beating yourself up
and tell me something.

519
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:51,271
Tell me something. Could you
identify him if you saw him again?

520
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:54,149
He came from behind,
I didn't see him.

521
00:37:57,027 --> 00:37:59,446
Let's go to the campus security,
you'll tell the everything.

522
00:38:07,788 --> 00:38:08,997
Hello.

523
00:38:09,331 --> 00:38:11,291
This woman has just been attacked.

524
00:38:11,542 --> 00:38:13,043
Are you okay?

525
00:38:13,252 --> 00:38:14,378
I think so.

526
00:38:14,586 --> 00:38:15,921
What's your name?

527
00:38:17,089 --> 00:38:18,632
Lauren Douglas.

528
00:38:19,174 --> 00:38:20,342
And who are you?

529
00:38:20,551 --> 00:38:21,885
Jack Gramm.

530
00:38:22,427 --> 00:38:24,388
The famous Dr. Jack Gramm?

531
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,390
Then Johnson Fonsen
have you be coming in.

532
00:38:26,473 --> 00:38:29,601
Is there someone to interview
Miss Douglas now, please?

533
00:38:30,394 --> 00:38:31,478
- Jimmy?
- Yeah.

534
00:38:31,562 --> 00:38:33,772
- You wanna check out this girl?
- Wait a minute.

535
00:38:34,189 --> 00:38:35,440
Right this way.

536
00:38:41,238 --> 00:38:42,865
What's going on here?

537
00:38:43,198 --> 00:38:45,450
The person who attacked her
may still be on the campus.

538
00:38:45,534 --> 00:38:46,493
What the hell you guys doing?

539
00:38:46,577 --> 00:38:49,162
We got all these guys out
on the bomb squad.

540
00:38:49,329 --> 00:38:51,790
Excuse me for one moment.
It's a little crazy around here.

541
00:38:51,957 --> 00:38:54,585
Jimmy, get off the phone
and interview Miss. Douglas, please.

542
00:38:54,835 --> 00:38:56,128
I'll be right there.

543
00:38:59,256 --> 00:39:00,507
Why won't you seat here?

544
00:39:03,927 --> 00:39:05,804
Okay, you okay?

545
00:39:08,765 --> 00:39:10,893
<i>- Jack Gramm Associates.
- Shelley? Get Frank...</i>

546
00:39:10,934 --> 00:39:12,728
<i>- and pass him through when you get him.
- Okay.</i>

547
00:39:12,769 --> 00:39:13,729
Okay, thank you.

548
00:39:14,771 --> 00:39:18,317
I don't want you going back to your
apartment until the locks are changed.

549
00:39:18,942 --> 00:39:20,444
I don't have anywhere else to go.

550
00:39:22,446 --> 00:39:24,740
After you talk
to the officer here...

551
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:28,410
go back to my office.
Shelley will find a place to stay.

552
00:39:28,452 --> 00:39:29,286
Okay.

553
00:39:29,494 --> 00:39:32,998
- Come on. It's gonna be all right.
- Sorry for all the troubles I caused.

554
00:39:36,793 --> 00:39:38,587
Miss. Douglas. Right this way.

555
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:41,798
- Right in here.
- I'm sorry.

556
00:39:43,634 --> 00:39:46,386
- Yeah?
- I left a word for Frank.

557
00:39:46,595 --> 00:39:49,014
<i>Okay.
There's been another incident.</i>

558
00:39:49,264 --> 00:39:51,558
The Forster's case it's your thing,
right?

559
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:53,227
Wrong, it's not my thing.

560
00:39:53,685 --> 00:39:56,271
I saw your testimony
on Court TV.

561
00:39:56,313 --> 00:39:57,356
Yeah, right?

562
00:39:57,981 --> 00:39:58,941
Fill those out.

563
00:40:00,776 --> 00:40:03,612
Yeah, I follow
the big crime cases.

564
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:04,905
They fascinate me.

565
00:40:05,364 --> 00:40:08,075
When Dr. Jack Gramm
takes the stand.

566
00:40:09,076 --> 00:40:10,744
You come up with things
I didn't think off.

567
00:40:14,164 --> 00:40:18,126
- This here, this is just a job until...
- Until you pass the police's exam.

568
00:40:18,377 --> 00:40:20,295
See? How did you know that?

569
00:40:20,629 --> 00:40:21,797
Just a guess.

570
00:40:22,005 --> 00:40:23,298
That's the thing about you.

571
00:40:23,549 --> 00:40:25,592
You know how to put two plus two
and you make it four.

572
00:40:26,176 --> 00:40:27,094
Or five.

573
00:40:27,678 --> 00:40:29,471
There are times that you know.

574
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,975
I'm not gonna be a campus cop
to a bunch of snob rich kids.

575
00:40:33,183 --> 00:40:34,309
Especially these rich bitches...

576
00:40:34,393 --> 00:40:38,480
My car is been analyzed.
The window was smashed.

577
00:40:38,814 --> 00:40:41,650
There's a number on the body.
Look into it.

578
00:40:42,276 --> 00:40:43,569
Dr. Gramm?

579
00:40:46,905 --> 00:40:48,407
Dr. Gramm?

580
00:40:52,703 --> 00:40:55,122
This is Johnny D'Franco,
from campus security.

581
00:40:55,289 --> 00:40:57,457
Can you get me Lynn Johnson?

582
00:40:58,041 --> 00:41:00,085
<i>- Jack Gramm Associates.
- Shelley?</i>

583
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:03,005
<i>- Did you find Frank?
- No, not yet. What the hell is going on?</i>

584
00:41:03,255 --> 00:41:08,177
Well, I received a threaten phone call
saying I have 88 minutes to live.

585
00:41:08,802 --> 00:41:11,305
<i>11:45h this morning,
and my time is up.</i>

586
00:41:11,597 --> 00:41:13,724
Pull out my risk assessment file.

587
00:41:13,932 --> 00:41:16,143
Anybody rating "e" and above...

588
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:18,687
<i>I want you to cross reference
against Forster.</i>

589
00:41:19,438 --> 00:41:21,064
<i>And when you find Frank...</i>

590
00:41:21,273 --> 00:41:25,652
ask him if Sara Pollard or any of my
students ever visit Forster in prison.

591
00:41:26,028 --> 00:41:27,821
Sara Pollard?

592
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:30,782
<i>She's the girl I met at the party
last night.</i>

593
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:33,493
<i>Call Wong Lee...</i>

594
00:41:33,577 --> 00:41:35,954
<i>and have him make a list
of all the phone numbers...</i>

595
00:41:36,246 --> 00:41:37,998
Forster called
on the last 72 hours.

596
00:41:38,332 --> 00:41:39,708
Where should fax the list?

597
00:41:40,626 --> 00:41:41,543
My apartment.

598
00:41:41,752 --> 00:41:43,879
And run a check on Kim.

599
00:41:45,714 --> 00:41:46,215
Kim?

600
00:41:47,549 --> 00:41:50,093
Yeah, just do it, okay?
Hello.

601
00:41:50,761 --> 00:41:51,303
Jack.

602
00:41:52,346 --> 00:41:54,389
- Damn it.
- The car is out front.

603
00:41:54,473 --> 00:41:56,225
- Drive Squaid.
- Good.

604
00:41:56,433 --> 00:41:57,851
You're okay?
You look a little freaked out.

605
00:41:57,935 --> 00:41:58,852
Yeah. You have...

606
00:41:59,061 --> 00:42:00,896
- a battery for your phone?
- Yeah, I do.

607
00:42:05,108 --> 00:42:06,902
- What the hell is this?
- What are you doing?

608
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:09,279
Goddamn it, what is this?

609
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:10,739
What are you doing with a gun
in your purse?

610
00:42:10,822 --> 00:42:12,449
Jesus, why don't you just announce
to the world?

611
00:42:12,658 --> 00:42:14,701
I don't think they've heard you
in English Department.

612
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:16,662
- Why the gun, Kim?
- For protection.

613
00:42:17,287 --> 00:42:19,915
- Where did you get it?
- I have a permit. My dad is a cop.

614
00:42:20,457 --> 00:42:23,335
- Why you need a gun?
- I don't. My dad thinks I do.

615
00:42:23,502 --> 00:42:24,711
Why?

616
00:42:24,795 --> 00:42:27,089
I have a crazy ex boyfriend,
okay, Jack?

617
00:42:27,172 --> 00:42:28,465
Oh. Jesus. God.

618
00:42:28,715 --> 00:42:31,426
Yeah, I really know how to pick one
or what?

619
00:42:31,468 --> 00:42:33,720
The judge said if he threats anyone
he goes back to jail.

620
00:42:33,804 --> 00:42:36,139
Back to jail? What jail?

621
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:39,142
Prison, actually.
Walla Walla.

622
00:42:41,854 --> 00:42:43,605
That's where Forster is.

623
00:42:45,941 --> 00:42:46,859
Come on, let's go.

624
00:42:47,651 --> 00:42:49,528
Special Agent Parks.

625
00:42:49,695 --> 00:42:50,821
<i>Frank, it's Jack.</i>

626
00:42:50,946 --> 00:42:54,366
I'm at the university campus.
We got a problem here.

627
00:42:54,449 --> 00:42:57,911
Someone attacked one of my students and
tried to knock her out with Halothane.

628
00:42:58,161 --> 00:43:01,582
<i>- That's the Seattle slayer.
- I know, hold on.</i>

629
00:43:01,832 --> 00:43:03,125
Give me a second.

630
00:43:04,251 --> 00:43:08,755
Yeah. There's a security guard
on this campus, his name is D'Franco.

631
00:43:08,964 --> 00:43:10,924
I don't like him.
He's suspicious.

632
00:43:11,175 --> 00:43:13,135
I want you to take him in
for questioning, okay?

633
00:43:13,343 --> 00:43:15,971
Also get a warrant
and search his place.

634
00:43:16,054 --> 00:43:17,139
Jesus Christ, Jack.

635
00:43:17,222 --> 00:43:19,975
You know I can't just get a warrant
without sufficient grounds.

636
00:43:20,184 --> 00:43:22,186
Just get a warrant, Frank,
come on.

637
00:43:22,269 --> 00:43:23,979
<i>Do you think he is the slayer?</i>

638
00:43:24,479 --> 00:43:27,441
<i>- To link Forster on the outside?
- It's possible.</i>

639
00:43:27,691 --> 00:43:31,486
Listen, I checked the names
that Shelley, of the students.

640
00:43:31,778 --> 00:43:35,490
And there's no record of Lauren Douglas,
Kim Cummings or Sara Pollard...

641
00:43:35,699 --> 00:43:36,617
but you gonna love this.

642
00:43:36,867 --> 00:43:41,496
<i>Mike Stempt visit Forster four times
over the last six weeks.</i>

643
00:43:41,997 --> 00:43:43,832
Mike Stempt. What was his reason?

644
00:43:44,249 --> 00:43:46,251
<i>Research.
He had written permission.</i>

645
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:48,504
<i>No, no, no.
I didn't give him any permission.</i>

646
00:43:48,754 --> 00:43:50,172
Written or otherwise.

647
00:43:50,422 --> 00:43:53,592
Well, it's your signature, Jack.
I got a copy right here.

648
00:43:54,843 --> 00:43:56,386
Hold on.
That... Hold on a second.

649
00:43:56,637 --> 00:43:58,722
That ex boyfriend of yours.
What is his name?

650
00:43:58,931 --> 00:44:00,349
Guy LaForge.

651
00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:03,268
Run a check on a parole
named Guy LaForge.

652
00:44:03,477 --> 00:44:06,271
He served time at Walla Walla
with Forster.

653
00:44:06,605 --> 00:44:09,107
And I'll call you back
when I get to my apartment.

654
00:44:09,441 --> 00:44:10,859
All right.

655
00:44:12,528 --> 00:44:14,112
Do you think that Frank is working
with Forster?

656
00:44:14,321 --> 00:44:15,614
<i>Someone is.</i>

657
00:44:15,781 --> 00:44:17,699
- I got you Johnson.
- Yeah.

658
00:44:18,408 --> 00:44:20,327
They've found a backpack
in your lecture hall.

659
00:44:20,702 --> 00:44:22,204
What? With a bomb in it?

660
00:44:22,663 --> 00:44:26,542
No. A photo, dynamite,
and a time with a note addressed to you.

661
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:27,668
What did it say?

662
00:44:27,876 --> 00:44:29,086
Tic-tac.

663
00:44:30,754 --> 00:44:31,797
What does it mean, Jack?

664
00:44:32,089 --> 00:44:33,674
I call you back.

665
00:44:58,574 --> 00:45:00,242
- You are okay?
- Yeah.

666
00:45:00,492 --> 00:45:02,244
What the hell was that?

667
00:45:03,787 --> 00:45:05,956
Probably somebody
trying to scare us.

668
00:45:06,123 --> 00:45:08,584
Who do you think would do
something like that?

669
00:45:09,543 --> 00:45:12,045
Does your boyfriend drive
a motorcycle?

670
00:45:12,296 --> 00:45:13,589
Yeah.

671
00:45:13,797 --> 00:45:16,383
Except he's not my boyfriend
anymore.

672
00:45:17,134 --> 00:45:17,885
Yeah.

673
00:45:18,135 --> 00:45:20,971
<i>How does it feel to know
you won't live through another night?</i>

674
00:45:21,138 --> 00:45:22,306
<i>56 minutes.</i>

675
00:45:23,056 --> 00:45:24,600
<i>Tic-tac, doc.</i>

676
00:45:26,351 --> 00:45:27,561
Let's go.

677
00:46:15,442 --> 00:46:17,027
Guy LaForge.

678
00:46:17,486 --> 00:46:19,363
He isn't a boyfriend, is he?

679
00:46:21,365 --> 00:46:24,868
The only thing that got me out of Texas
was my books marks.

680
00:46:25,994 --> 00:46:29,414
And when I left for college,
I had that, but not much else.

681
00:46:29,498 --> 00:46:33,001
So I tried to fit in.
I drank too much.

682
00:46:34,711 --> 00:46:36,255
Thought too little.

683
00:46:36,922 --> 00:46:38,674
And I met Guy.

684
00:46:42,219 --> 00:46:44,221
And he was this English...

685
00:46:44,763 --> 00:46:47,349
working class rock star
wanna be.

686
00:46:47,432 --> 00:46:49,309
And I fell for him.

687
00:46:50,561 --> 00:46:52,396
And I married him...

688
00:46:52,479 --> 00:46:54,064
when I graduated.

689
00:46:55,566 --> 00:46:59,695
He didn't take to well to my aspirations
for higher education.

690
00:47:00,153 --> 00:47:03,782
In fact he didn't really want me to
leave the house. And when I disobeyed...

691
00:47:03,991 --> 00:47:06,910
he got filthy drunk
and he beat me.

692
00:47:07,411 --> 00:47:09,746
That's when he got arrested
and I divorced him.

693
00:47:09,997 --> 00:47:13,000
I've been trying to make up
for lost time ever since.

694
00:47:18,422 --> 00:47:21,550
- You know, Forster is trying to kill me.
- Forster is in prison.

695
00:47:21,842 --> 00:47:24,511
Yeah, I know. He's got someone
on the outside trying to...

696
00:47:25,470 --> 00:47:27,097
to do the job.

697
00:47:30,225 --> 00:47:31,768
He's gonna kill me.

698
00:47:33,353 --> 00:47:35,272
If I don't get him first.

699
00:47:40,861 --> 00:47:43,405
Whoever is working with Forster
must be close to you.

700
00:47:43,572 --> 00:47:46,950
- A friend even.
- I don't have many friends.

701
00:47:47,159 --> 00:47:48,243
That's a plus.

702
00:47:48,327 --> 00:47:51,580
It's a real pleasure to look at everyone
you know as your would be murderer.

703
00:47:51,788 --> 00:47:54,249
Paranoia is a normal state of mind,
huh?

704
00:47:55,918 --> 00:47:57,002
Where is Errol?

705
00:47:57,085 --> 00:47:59,963
I don't know. I'm a temp.
The agency sent me.

706
00:48:00,589 --> 00:48:02,090
Dr. Gramm?

707
00:48:02,549 --> 00:48:04,301
There's a package for you.

708
00:48:07,804 --> 00:48:09,306
How did you know my name?

709
00:48:09,473 --> 00:48:12,017
I don't.
It was a question.

710
00:48:13,644 --> 00:48:14,811
Yeah.

711
00:48:15,687 --> 00:48:18,106
- There's no returning address on this?
- No.

712
00:48:19,691 --> 00:48:21,109
Who delivered it?

713
00:48:21,318 --> 00:48:24,446
A carrier. But there was
another person here at the same time...

714
00:48:24,613 --> 00:48:26,782
- Looking for you.
- Who?

715
00:48:27,032 --> 00:48:29,284
- What was his name?
- No, I didn't get it.

716
00:48:29,451 --> 00:48:31,828
When he walked in I was on the phone
with the plumber.

717
00:48:31,912 --> 00:48:37,167
- He said he would be right back.
- Okay.

718
00:48:37,251 --> 00:48:38,836
You wanna me pull
the surveillance tapes?

719
00:48:38,919 --> 00:48:41,421
That shouldn't take more than an hour
to get someone up here with the keys.

720
00:48:43,674 --> 00:48:45,384
- I don't have an hour.
- No?

721
00:48:45,634 --> 00:48:50,430
Hey, you know, he was also wearing
leathers. He had a motorcycle helmet.

722
00:48:50,639 --> 00:48:52,808
That's Guy. He was here.

723
00:48:54,434 --> 00:48:57,521
If he comes back,
don't send him up to my apartment.

724
00:48:58,188 --> 00:48:59,439
Yeah.

725
00:49:00,315 --> 00:49:02,192
- Hi, Dr. Gramm.
- Hi, Eva.

726
00:49:11,159 --> 00:49:13,328
How did Guy know
we're going to be here?

727
00:49:13,537 --> 00:49:15,330
How does even know
where you live?

728
00:49:15,622 --> 00:49:17,499
Oh, Walther P99.

729
00:49:17,708 --> 00:49:19,877
That would blow a hole
through anything.

730
00:49:21,587 --> 00:49:23,839
What?
I grew up around guns.

731
00:49:24,089 --> 00:49:27,342
Maybe he didn't know I was gonna
be here, maybe that's why he showed up.

732
00:49:28,218 --> 00:49:31,305
I'll verify where he went after
the party last night.

733
00:49:32,556 --> 00:49:35,225
<i>There's a Lauren Douglas to see you.
Should I send her up?</i>

734
00:49:35,893 --> 00:49:37,269
Okay, send her up.

735
00:49:40,355 --> 00:49:42,316
He got that right, didn't he?

736
00:49:42,649 --> 00:49:44,109
Hey, what's that?

737
00:49:44,776 --> 00:49:46,028
This?

738
00:49:46,570 --> 00:49:48,322
It's a chemical detector.

739
00:49:48,989 --> 00:49:52,993
It sniffs out vapors.
Custom agencies are using it.

740
00:49:53,744 --> 00:49:54,995
And?

741
00:50:00,584 --> 00:50:02,044
It's not a bomb.

742
00:50:02,503 --> 00:50:03,504
That's good.

743
00:50:04,254 --> 00:50:05,380
Yeah.

744
00:50:17,559 --> 00:50:19,061
- Hi.
- Hi.

745
00:50:19,144 --> 00:50:22,064
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. I'm better, thank you.

746
00:50:24,608 --> 00:50:27,444
- What do you have?
- I went to see Shelley like you said.

747
00:50:27,528 --> 00:50:30,489
She tried to fax you over some papers,
but the machine was down.

748
00:50:30,864 --> 00:50:34,201
So I said I'd bring the risk assessment
profiles over myself.

749
00:50:35,118 --> 00:50:37,663
I didn't know you had company.

750
00:50:38,038 --> 00:50:41,250
Dale told me how good you're with her
when her dad died.

751
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,794
She was so grateful.

752
00:50:45,212 --> 00:50:46,797
Dr. Gramm?

753
00:50:46,964 --> 00:50:48,006
Yeah?

754
00:50:48,215 --> 00:50:50,801
If there's anything I can do
to help you find Dale's murderer...

755
00:50:50,884 --> 00:50:53,470
- will you let me know?
- Of course, yes.

756
00:50:54,596 --> 00:50:55,806
Thank you.

757
00:50:56,974 --> 00:50:59,560
Can I call you a cab
or something?

758
00:50:59,977 --> 00:51:02,354
No, Mike is gonna give me
a ride.

759
00:51:02,646 --> 00:51:03,856
- Okay.
- Thanks for these...

760
00:51:04,189 --> 00:51:05,315
Bye.

761
00:51:09,528 --> 00:51:11,864
All those people
have threatened you?

762
00:51:12,030 --> 00:51:14,825
Well, you know,
it comes with the territory.

763
00:51:15,450 --> 00:51:17,744
How come you never mention that
in class?

764
00:51:18,996 --> 00:51:22,666
How many students end up going
into this field anyway?

765
00:51:23,166 --> 00:51:26,587
Not very many
with you booting all of them.

766
00:51:27,671 --> 00:51:28,505
Yeah.

767
00:51:37,181 --> 00:51:39,266
Can I ask you
a personal question?

768
00:51:39,474 --> 00:51:40,642
No.

769
00:51:41,852 --> 00:51:43,270
How come you never
got married?

770
00:51:43,770 --> 00:51:45,814
I mean,
you're a pretty good prospect.

771
00:51:46,607 --> 00:51:48,483
You obviously make a shit load
of money.

772
00:51:48,567 --> 00:51:49,651
Why would I get married?

773
00:51:49,902 --> 00:51:52,112
I'm a target for any nut
with a grudge.

774
00:51:54,406 --> 00:51:56,658
I can't afford emotional
attachments.

775
00:51:56,909 --> 00:51:58,243
Yeah, but don't you want kids?

776
00:51:58,702 --> 00:52:00,204
Don't you want a family?

777
00:52:00,454 --> 00:52:02,039
I'm too old for kids.

778
00:52:05,209 --> 00:52:07,586
You're too young for me, Kim.

779
00:52:10,714 --> 00:52:14,593
If you want me to leave, Jack, all
you've got to do is say it and I'm gone.

780
00:52:14,885 --> 00:52:16,803
No, I don't want you to leave.

781
00:52:17,221 --> 00:52:18,680
I need you, Kim.

782
00:52:18,764 --> 00:52:20,891
You are smart
and you are important to me.

783
00:52:20,974 --> 00:52:22,809
Really, you are.

784
00:52:25,479 --> 00:52:26,688
Okay.

785
00:52:45,374 --> 00:52:47,376
<i>- Yeah.
- Jack, it's Shelley.</i>

786
00:52:47,417 --> 00:52:48,919
What the hell happened to you?
Where have you been

787
00:52:49,127 --> 00:52:52,172
Making calls for you, four lines
simultaneously. The fax is down.

788
00:52:52,214 --> 00:52:54,591
<i>I know, Lauren Douglas came over
and brought some papers with her.</i>

789
00:52:54,675 --> 00:52:56,510
Jack, you better turn on MS-NBC.

790
00:52:56,677 --> 00:52:57,427
Why?

791
00:52:57,511 --> 00:53:00,180
Forster got a judge to grant
his request for an interview.

792
00:53:00,347 --> 00:53:01,306
<i>He's on, live.</i>

793
00:53:01,515 --> 00:53:04,059
<i>This is gonna heat things up</i>

794
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:04,784
<i>When looking for a home...</i>

795
00:53:04,868 --> 00:53:07,245
<i>a real estate agent is really important
in you life. You need someone...</i>

796
00:53:09,242 --> 00:53:10,660
Shelley. Listen to me.

797
00:53:10,869 --> 00:53:14,164
I want you to send some of the boys
to my apartment, all right?

798
00:53:14,372 --> 00:53:17,917
There may be someone down at my lobby
in biker leathers when they get there.

799
00:53:18,001 --> 00:53:18,960
Okay?

800
00:53:19,627 --> 00:53:22,422
<i>- You got a name?
- Yes, his name is Guy LaForge.</i>

801
00:53:22,797 --> 00:53:27,177
Put a photo
on the FBI wire, okay?

802
00:53:27,427 --> 00:53:29,554
<i>If you are not granted
another stay of the execution...</i>

803
00:53:29,804 --> 00:53:31,139
<i>are you prepared to die?</i>

804
00:53:31,389 --> 00:53:32,348
You want me to call the police?

805
00:53:32,432 --> 00:53:35,351
No, no, let Frank handle it.
He'll know what to do.

806
00:53:35,435 --> 00:53:37,604
<i>As prepared as any man can be
to pay for something he didn't do.</i>

807
00:53:37,687 --> 00:53:38,772
Listen.

808
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:42,567
You didn't message over a package
to my apartment, did you?

809
00:53:42,817 --> 00:53:43,443
No.

810
00:53:43,693 --> 00:53:46,112
<i>There is a lot of people out there
that believe in your innocence.</i>

811
00:53:46,321 --> 00:53:47,113
<i>And I'm grateful.</i>

812
00:53:47,322 --> 00:53:48,615
You know anyone that might have?

813
00:53:48,823 --> 00:53:50,617
<i>- No.
- I'm grateful for their prayers.</i>

814
00:53:50,825 --> 00:53:53,036
<i>- Everything goes to your office.
- And support.</i>

815
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:54,996
What about Pollard.
Find anything on her?

816
00:53:55,830 --> 00:53:57,374
You didn't actually paid her,
did you, Jack?

817
00:53:57,582 --> 00:54:00,251
- Pay her, what do you mean?
- She works for a escort service.

818
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:01,920
Escort service?

819
00:54:02,212 --> 00:54:03,922
<i>You didn't know?</i>

820
00:54:04,339 --> 00:54:05,590
No, I didn't know.

821
00:54:08,009 --> 00:54:11,638
What? She told me she was a lawyer.
A student lawyer.

822
00:54:12,138 --> 00:54:14,140
<i>What are your thoughts
this time?</i>

823
00:54:14,224 --> 00:54:16,768
<i>Well, Stephanie, that's one thing
I don't have a lot of...</i>

824
00:54:17,102 --> 00:54:18,978
You got a number for her?

825
00:54:20,313 --> 00:54:21,648
<i>Yeah, a phone number
and the address.</i>

826
00:54:21,815 --> 00:54:23,191
I know the address.

827
00:54:23,942 --> 00:54:24,943
Let me have the number.

828
00:54:25,151 --> 00:54:27,278
<i>If Dr. Gramm was with us right now,
what would you say to him?</i>

829
00:54:27,362 --> 00:54:30,156
<i>555-1352.</i>

830
00:54:30,365 --> 00:54:32,158
<i>He knows that I didn't do this.</i>

831
00:54:32,867 --> 00:54:33,827
<i>- There's only one...
- Thanks.</i>

832
00:54:33,910 --> 00:54:37,997
<i>Other person in this world
who knows I've been framed.</i>

833
00:54:38,248 --> 00:54:42,377
<i>That it was a set up.
That I'm totally innocent.</i>

834
00:54:43,044 --> 00:54:47,173
<i>And that would be the forensic
psychiatric Dr. Jack Gramm.</i>

835
00:54:48,049 --> 00:54:51,219
<i>I guess what I'd say to Jack Gramm...
I'd say, "Why me"?</i>

836
00:54:53,096 --> 00:54:56,141
<i>I understand that you've suffered
a great loss with your sister.</i>

837
00:54:56,599 --> 00:54:59,060
<i>I feel your pain, Dr. Gramm.</i>

838
00:54:59,519 --> 00:55:01,312
<i>- Pick it up, damn it.
- But that doesn't exonerate you...</i>

839
00:55:01,396 --> 00:55:05,859
<i>from false accusing me of things that
you know I did not, could not have done.</i>

840
00:55:05,942 --> 00:55:07,152
Pick up, Sara.

841
00:55:07,902 --> 00:55:10,447
<i>If I can be convicted
of this voodoo forensic science...</i>

842
00:55:10,530 --> 00:55:12,032
<i>think about it... Who is safe?</i>

843
00:55:15,285 --> 00:55:16,453
Shelley?

844
00:55:16,703 --> 00:55:18,955
Shelley?
I want you to get MS-NBC.

845
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:21,958
<i>- I want to talk to that son-of-bitch.
- I would be the last.</i>

846
00:55:22,208 --> 00:55:23,710
Jack, I really don't think
that's a good idea.

847
00:55:24,002 --> 00:55:27,130
It's a good idea. Just get them
and when you get them call me back, OK?

848
00:55:27,714 --> 00:55:30,884
<i>But I find hard to believe that
Dr. Jack Gramm can be out there...</i>

849
00:55:31,217 --> 00:55:34,804
<i>psycho battling innocent people
into the death chamber.</i>

850
00:55:35,305 --> 00:55:37,182
<i>Who is the murder now, Jack?</i>

851
00:55:38,058 --> 00:55:38,892
Yeah?

852
00:55:39,476 --> 00:55:40,894
<i>Who is the murder now?</i>

853
00:55:41,269 --> 00:55:42,729
<i>Jack?</i>

854
00:55:43,021 --> 00:55:45,356
We got D'Franco in custody.

855
00:55:45,607 --> 00:55:47,108
I got the warrant.

856
00:55:47,317 --> 00:55:49,444
The guys are on the way
over to his place.

857
00:55:49,527 --> 00:55:51,279
Did he say anything about Forster?

858
00:55:51,488 --> 00:55:53,448
<i>A quite bit, but nothing useful.</i>

859
00:55:53,948 --> 00:55:55,200
What about Guy LaForge?

860
00:55:55,492 --> 00:55:58,745
He hasn't checked in with
his parole office in six weeks.

861
00:55:58,995 --> 00:56:02,123
Well, he was at my apartment building
less than an hour ago.

862
00:56:02,332 --> 00:56:04,000
And he said he's coming back.

863
00:56:05,001 --> 00:56:06,753
Listen, Frank.

864
00:56:06,961 --> 00:56:09,089
I got a call
a little while ago...

865
00:56:09,297 --> 00:56:11,174
saying I have 88 minutes
to live.

866
00:56:11,466 --> 00:56:14,177
Jesus, Jack.
Why 88 minutes?

867
00:56:19,432 --> 00:56:21,017
I don't know.

868
00:56:22,310 --> 00:56:24,437
<i>You have any idea
who this caller is?</i>

869
00:56:27,315 --> 00:56:31,945
You better find Guy LaForge
before he gets here, okay?

870
00:56:32,028 --> 00:56:33,988
Listen, let me call you back.

871
00:56:34,155 --> 00:56:35,240
Jack?

872
00:56:36,324 --> 00:56:37,033
Shit.

873
00:56:54,676 --> 00:56:55,802
<i>Mom.</i>

874
00:56:56,052 --> 00:56:57,595
<i>Dad.</i>

875
00:56:57,846 --> 00:56:59,055
<i>Jack.</i>

876
00:56:59,764 --> 00:57:01,182
<i>There's someone in here.</i>

877
00:57:01,349 --> 00:57:03,309
<i>And he wants to talk to you.</i>

878
00:57:03,935 --> 00:57:05,353
<i>Where are you?</i>

879
00:57:05,437 --> 00:57:07,564
<i>Please, come home quickly!</i>

880
00:57:07,814 --> 00:57:09,733
<i>I'm here with a man.</i>

881
00:57:10,108 --> 00:57:12,193
<i>It is not what
you want me to say...</i>

882
00:57:13,027 --> 00:57:16,823
<i>Jack, come here now!
Help me. Help me.</i>

883
00:57:29,919 --> 00:57:31,504
Jack, what is that?

884
00:57:33,048 --> 00:57:34,466
My sister.

885
00:57:35,216 --> 00:57:36,718
Oh, my God!

886
00:57:38,219 --> 00:57:41,097
That's horrible.
Who would send that to you?

887
00:57:43,725 --> 00:57:46,352
There's only two copies
of this tape in the world.

888
00:57:46,436 --> 00:57:47,812
One is...

889
00:57:48,229 --> 00:57:51,024
Locked up in custody of NYPD.

890
00:57:51,066 --> 00:57:52,442
And the other...

891
00:57:54,819 --> 00:57:57,864
is in a restricted access room...

892
00:57:58,031 --> 00:58:00,116
in my office file cabinet...

893
00:58:01,826 --> 00:58:04,371
with the highest
security measures.

894
00:58:04,412 --> 00:58:06,247
So you're thinking it was stolen.

895
00:58:06,664 --> 00:58:08,625
Of course it was stolen.

896
00:58:15,757 --> 00:58:17,133
You think I stole it?

897
00:58:18,885 --> 00:58:20,595
You think I stole it?

898
00:58:20,804 --> 00:58:22,680
You left the bar yesterday night
with Dale.

899
00:58:22,764 --> 00:58:26,017
One of the last people to see
her alive. Maybe the last.

900
00:58:26,226 --> 00:58:30,480
Jack, you think I stole the tape
and killed Dale?

901
00:58:30,647 --> 00:58:32,023
Have you lost your mind?

902
00:58:32,273 --> 00:58:35,110
I don't have clearance
to your restricted access room.

903
00:58:35,193 --> 00:58:37,195
Why Guy LaForge was at the bar
last night?

904
00:58:39,322 --> 00:58:41,324
<i>He was trying to protect me.</i>

905
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:42,951
<i>From what?</i>

906
00:58:44,411 --> 00:58:47,038
- From you.
- From me? He knows about me?

907
00:58:47,205 --> 00:58:48,707
- Yes.
- What does he know about me?

908
00:58:48,957 --> 00:58:52,085
He knows I have
a silly girlish crush on you.

909
00:58:53,169 --> 00:58:54,754
Jack. Hold on a second.

910
00:58:54,879 --> 00:58:57,716
I just got an email
from Mike Stempt, okay?

911
00:58:57,966 --> 00:59:00,760
He saw Guy at Darby's Club
last night.

912
00:59:00,969 --> 00:59:03,430
When Mike left at 3 am,
Guy was still sitting there...

913
00:59:03,471 --> 00:59:05,515
and they've bounced a beer
until 6 am.

914
00:59:05,974 --> 00:59:09,060
So there's no way that Guy
could have killed Dale Morris.

915
00:59:17,610 --> 00:59:20,447
<i>- Yeah?
- Did you listen to the tape, Dr. Gramm?</i>

916
00:59:20,613 --> 00:59:23,033
<i>Why did you leave the little Katie
all alone?</i>

917
00:59:23,199 --> 00:59:24,659
<i>Why, Dr. Gramm?</i>

918
00:59:24,826 --> 00:59:29,122
<i>She'd still be alive today if you
hadn't left her all alone to die.</i>

919
00:59:30,123 --> 00:59:33,960
<i>Now it's your turn.
In a glaze of glory!</i>

920
00:59:34,294 --> 00:59:35,754
<i>Tic-tac, doc.</i>

921
00:59:35,962 --> 00:59:37,213
<i>You have 37 minutes.</i>

922
00:59:50,643 --> 00:59:51,311
Yeah?

923
00:59:51,519 --> 00:59:54,606
Hey, Jack, I got MS-NBC on the line.
I'll patch you through the prison.

924
00:59:54,856 --> 00:59:57,650
<i>- You're sure you wanna do this?
- Shelley.</i>

925
00:59:58,568 --> 01:00:02,864
There's been a breach in my place,
in my most secure area.

926
01:00:03,323 --> 01:00:07,118
Did you ever give anyone clearance
to go into my secure files?

927
01:00:07,202 --> 01:00:08,328
Jack, what are you saying?

928
01:00:08,536 --> 01:00:11,998
Did you ever let
an unauthorized person...

929
01:00:12,082 --> 01:00:14,042
into my secure files area?

930
01:00:14,292 --> 01:00:17,003
No, never.
To anyone.

931
01:00:17,212 --> 01:00:17,962
Ever.

932
01:00:18,213 --> 01:00:19,381
Okay.

933
01:00:20,382 --> 01:00:22,967
Now put me through the MS-NBC.

934
01:00:28,556 --> 01:00:29,849
Frank?

935
01:00:29,891 --> 01:00:33,228
<i>- Yeah.
- Yeah, turn on the MSN-BC.</i>

936
01:00:33,436 --> 01:00:36,689
They've granted Forster
a live interview.

937
01:00:36,898 --> 01:00:38,525
<i>I can't, Jack,
I'm in the car.</i>

938
01:00:38,733 --> 01:00:43,029
It's all right. They also will cast.
You just turn on 750 AM.

939
01:00:43,279 --> 01:00:44,531
I'm phoning in.

940
01:00:44,989 --> 01:00:48,076
Wait a second. You think is such
a good idea? With all the court actions?

941
01:00:48,159 --> 01:00:51,496
I think he's behind everything. I think
he's behind the phone calls, threats...

942
01:00:51,579 --> 01:00:54,416
I'm gonna try to get inside his head.
Make him crack.

943
01:00:54,624 --> 01:00:56,459
Okay?
You wanna stay on the line, please?

944
01:00:57,752 --> 01:00:59,379
<i>- Dr. Gramm?
- Yeah.</i>

945
01:00:59,462 --> 01:01:00,046
<i>You're on the air.</i>

946
01:01:00,296 --> 01:01:04,050
<i>I've been told that we have Dr. Gramm
joining us by phone.</i>

947
01:01:04,092 --> 01:01:06,428
<i>- Dr. Gramm, are you there?
- I'm here.</i>

948
01:01:06,678 --> 01:01:08,221
<i>Have you been watching
the interview?</i>

949
01:01:08,304 --> 01:01:10,682
<i>- Is that what you call it?
- What would you call it?</i>

950
01:01:10,932 --> 01:01:13,393
I don't know, I don't call it an
interview. I call it an entertainment.

951
01:01:13,476 --> 01:01:15,395
I call it a performance, maybe.

952
01:01:15,562 --> 01:01:17,689
<i>You must have got something to say
or you wouldn't have called in.</i>

953
01:01:17,897 --> 01:01:21,568
Oh, yeah, I think it's very interesting
that Forster talks about forgiveness.

954
01:01:21,776 --> 01:01:24,821
I just want him to know that
his victims have not forgiven him.

955
01:01:24,904 --> 01:01:27,073
<i>Look, you've lied under oath,
Dr. Gramm, and you know it.</i>

956
01:01:27,115 --> 01:01:30,160
This is not about me.
This about the women you've raped...

957
01:01:30,243 --> 01:01:31,911
and tortured and murdered.

958
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:35,206
<i>- Women like Janie Kay.
- I have nothing to do with her death...</i>

959
01:01:35,290 --> 01:01:37,083
<i>- and you know it.
- Nothing to do with her death?</i>

960
01:01:37,125 --> 01:01:40,712
There was an eyewitness,
a twin sister who identified you.

961
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:42,714
She was at the scene
and identified you.

962
01:01:42,797 --> 01:01:44,507
<i>She was drugged
and beaten so badly...</i>

963
01:01:44,591 --> 01:01:46,551
<i>she said that she couldn't
be sure, but you...</i>

964
01:01:46,634 --> 01:01:48,428
<i>you bereaved her until she said
it was me.</i>

965
01:01:48,636 --> 01:01:50,180
Interesting that you didn't say
that you're innocent.

966
01:01:50,263 --> 01:01:53,266
<i>- I had nothing to do with the death...
- No, I don't. I know you're convicted.</i>

967
01:01:53,391 --> 01:01:55,143
You're convicted by a jury.

968
01:01:55,226 --> 01:01:57,145
You were trialed and convicted,
that's what I know.

969
01:01:57,187 --> 01:01:59,272
<i>Trial? That wasn't a trial,
that was an inquisition.</i>

970
01:01:59,355 --> 01:02:00,440
<i>And the jury believed your lies.</i>

971
01:02:00,523 --> 01:02:04,652
You had to cause pain, suffer and death,
so you could feel alive.

972
01:02:04,861 --> 01:02:05,570
<i>Wait a second.</i>

973
01:02:05,653 --> 01:02:08,114
<i>Pain and suffer is something that you,
forensics, know how to inflict.</i>

974
01:02:08,198 --> 01:02:12,452
Even your idol, Ted Bundy,
ultimately, identified his victims.

975
01:02:12,660 --> 01:02:15,288
How about, man,
identify your victims?

976
01:02:15,497 --> 01:02:16,122
How about?

977
01:02:16,206 --> 01:02:21,795
The bodies of Terry Hines, Alicia Smith,
Samantha Green. Where are they, man?

978
01:02:22,003 --> 01:02:22,962
Come on, where are they?

979
01:02:23,171 --> 01:02:26,966
Give these people's families closure,
man! Give them closure.

980
01:02:27,008 --> 01:02:30,261
You're on national television now!
Millions of people are watching you.

981
01:02:30,345 --> 01:02:30,887
Come on!

982
01:02:30,970 --> 01:02:33,014
<i>How about your colleague in London,
in the Clark case?</i>

983
01:02:34,182 --> 01:02:37,727
<i>Putting in an innocent mother
for murdering her baby? Well done!</i>

984
01:02:37,936 --> 01:02:41,398
<i>Well done, doctor. You must be so proud
of being part of an elite fortunate.</i>

985
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:44,484
<i>Fortunately for her,
her conviction was overturned...</i>

986
01:02:44,526 --> 01:02:47,946
<i>when the doctor's testimony
turned out to be an absurd.</i>

987
01:02:48,154 --> 01:02:49,406
<i>Quack, quack, Dr. Gramm?</i>

988
01:02:49,656 --> 01:02:50,990
<i>You now what?</i>

989
01:02:51,199 --> 01:02:53,493
<i>Why don't you take a good look
at your watch?</i>

990
01:02:53,702 --> 01:02:55,078
<i>A good look.</i>

991
01:02:55,787 --> 01:02:59,916
<i>Now imagine what it'd be like to be
minutes away from your own death.</i>

992
01:03:00,875 --> 01:03:02,210
<i>To hear the ticking of a clock...</i>

993
01:03:02,419 --> 01:03:05,422
<i>and know that your time on earth
is drying to a close.</i>

994
01:03:07,173 --> 01:03:08,466
Thank you.

995
01:03:10,135 --> 01:03:13,263
<i>There's another package for you,
Dr. Gramm. Should I send it up?</i>

996
01:03:13,596 --> 01:03:15,348
<i>This has just got in.</i>

997
01:03:15,598 --> 01:03:19,102
<i>A three judge panel of the Nine Circuit
has just granted John Forster...</i>

998
01:03:19,310 --> 01:03:20,729
<i>a stay of the execution.</i>

999
01:03:22,647 --> 01:03:23,648
<i>What?</i>

1000
01:03:26,943 --> 01:03:28,111
<i>Are you serious?</i>

1001
01:03:33,450 --> 01:03:34,617
You hear that, Frank?

1002
01:03:34,909 --> 01:03:36,161
Yeah, I heard.

1003
01:03:36,578 --> 01:03:38,038
Forster got the stay.

1004
01:03:38,413 --> 01:03:41,583
I got him going, didn't I?
No cigar.

1005
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,919
<i>Why did you send me
on a wild goose chase, Jack?</i>

1006
01:03:45,086 --> 01:03:46,212
What do you mean,
wild goose chase?

1007
01:03:46,296 --> 01:03:49,132
D'Franco is not a serial killer,
he's a serial groupie.

1008
01:03:49,299 --> 01:03:51,551
So he's a groupie so what?
What's the big deal?

1009
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:54,512
<i>I've just got a call from Jeremy Guber
from attorney general office.</i>

1010
01:03:54,721 --> 01:03:57,599
You are wanted for questioning
on the murder of Dale Morris.

1011
01:03:57,932 --> 01:04:00,018
What?
What are you talking about?

1012
01:04:00,268 --> 01:04:03,938
They've found physical evidence at
her apartment that implicates you, Jack.

1013
01:04:04,147 --> 01:04:05,065
What evidence?

1014
01:04:05,106 --> 01:04:06,149
Jack...

1015
01:04:06,649 --> 01:04:08,401
you know I can't say.

1016
01:04:08,610 --> 01:04:11,237
<i>What you mean, you can't say?
What does that mean?</i>

1017
01:04:11,863 --> 01:04:14,574
<i>- Frank?
- There's someone to see you...</i>

1018
01:04:14,616 --> 01:04:16,326
<i>Mister, you can't go up there.</i>

1019
01:04:17,202 --> 01:04:18,828
You told the doorman
to don't let anyone up.

1020
01:04:18,912 --> 01:04:21,623
It's all right, don't worry.
Don't worry, no-one is getting in.

1021
01:04:29,422 --> 01:04:32,634
<i>The state attorney general
has just announced that his appealing...</i>

1022
01:04:32,717 --> 01:04:34,719
<i>is taken to the State Supreme Court
immediately.</i>

1023
01:04:35,011 --> 01:04:36,096
Jack. There's smoke.

1024
01:04:36,137 --> 01:04:38,640
<i>We'll keep you informed
with further developments.</i>

1025
01:04:41,684 --> 01:04:43,436
There's smoke here too.

1026
01:04:59,869 --> 01:05:01,287
It's your boyfriend.

1027
01:05:01,496 --> 01:05:02,706
<i>Let Kim go.</i>

1028
01:05:02,914 --> 01:05:04,332
<i>Let her go now
and no-one will get hurt.</i>

1029
01:05:04,499 --> 01:05:07,502
Guy, I'm fine.
There's no problem here.

1030
01:05:07,669 --> 01:05:10,130
<i>The building is on fire.
That's a problem.</i>

1031
01:05:10,338 --> 01:05:12,090
- He's got a gun.
- Okay. Listen to me.

1032
01:05:12,382 --> 01:05:14,843
I know this man and I know
he's not gonna hurt me again.

1033
01:05:14,926 --> 01:05:16,970
You have to trust me, Jack.
Please, open the door.

1034
01:05:17,137 --> 01:05:19,514
<i>- Do it quickly. There's smoke up here.
- Kim.</i>

1035
01:05:19,723 --> 01:05:23,268
Guy, I'm coming out.
We can calm things down, okay?

1036
01:05:24,853 --> 01:05:27,689
Guy, look at me.
I'm fine. There's no problem here.

1037
01:05:27,939 --> 01:05:31,484
- What are you doing with him?
- I'm okay. There's no problem.

1038
01:05:33,737 --> 01:05:36,406
Guy has been shot.
No!

1039
01:05:45,540 --> 01:05:48,043
On the roof there's a fire escape.
Okay?

1040
01:05:48,293 --> 01:05:51,212
- When I say "go", follow me.
- Okay.

1041
01:06:08,980 --> 01:06:11,024
Do you think he is dead?

1042
01:06:11,232 --> 01:06:14,277
- He doesn't look good.
- We should go back up there.

1043
01:06:14,903 --> 01:06:16,821
I gotta go back there
and help him.

1044
01:06:17,238 --> 01:06:20,033
No. You can't go up there.
Man.

1045
01:06:21,242 --> 01:06:23,078
<i>- Yeah?
- Jack, I need to talk to you.</i>

1046
01:06:23,244 --> 01:06:25,246
I need two minutes to clarify
something?

1047
01:06:25,413 --> 01:06:26,831
Shelley, I can't talk now.

1048
01:06:27,082 --> 01:06:29,584
<i>I'll talk to you
when I get to Sara Pollard apartment.</i>

1049
01:06:33,254 --> 01:06:35,632
Miss. Lewinsky.
Are you okay?

1050
01:06:35,799 --> 01:06:37,884
- I'm just a little bit dizzy.
- Come.

1051
01:06:41,513 --> 01:06:44,057
Because I didn't see
a device with a timer.

1052
01:06:44,265 --> 01:06:46,267
Get the bomb squad,
this is the second one.

1053
01:06:46,351 --> 01:06:47,477
Go.

1054
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:52,982
- Get her some oxygen.
- All right. We got her, sir.

1055
01:06:53,108 --> 01:06:55,068
Let's go outside.
You gonna be all right.

1056
01:07:02,951 --> 01:07:05,495
Jack, I don't see the shooter,
do you?

1057
01:07:06,788 --> 01:07:07,580
Jack.

1058
01:07:07,706 --> 01:07:09,916
- He's got a gun.
- Where?

1059
01:07:10,417 --> 01:07:11,876
Where the hell is he?

1060
01:07:12,085 --> 01:07:13,545
- Where?
- Jack!

1061
01:07:13,837 --> 01:07:15,296
Get down!

1062
01:07:20,468 --> 01:07:21,761
- Kim!
- Keep moving!

1063
01:07:21,845 --> 01:07:23,096
Kim, where are you?

1064
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:41,614
Go, go, go!

1065
01:07:41,948 --> 01:07:43,450
Move back!

1066
01:07:43,742 --> 01:07:46,828
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm gonna live.

1067
01:07:47,537 --> 01:07:49,122
Here, let's go.

1068
01:07:49,456 --> 01:07:50,623
Where are we going?

1069
01:07:51,583 --> 01:07:53,334
To Sara Pollard house.

1070
01:07:53,501 --> 01:07:55,795
She's the girl I was with
last night.

1071
01:07:57,172 --> 01:07:59,215
That's funny.
It worked in the garage.

1072
01:08:04,721 --> 01:08:06,014
Why did you do that?

1073
01:08:06,222 --> 01:08:08,308
I don't know.
I had a feeling...

1074
01:08:26,618 --> 01:08:27,952
Are you okay?

1075
01:08:31,998 --> 01:08:33,458
What next?

1076
01:08:34,542 --> 01:08:35,877
I don't know.

1077
01:08:40,382 --> 01:08:42,175
- Okay, let's get out of here.
- Okay.

1078
01:08:49,599 --> 01:08:51,351
- Is that your cab?
- Yeah.

1079
01:08:51,559 --> 01:08:53,603
Okay.
I give you a hundred bucks...

1080
01:08:53,686 --> 01:08:56,022
you let me drive it.
I'm just going across town.

1081
01:08:56,106 --> 01:08:57,273
A hundred bucks?

1082
01:08:57,816 --> 01:09:00,610
A hundred bucks plus tip.
How is that?

1083
01:09:00,860 --> 01:09:02,028
All right.

1084
01:09:15,291 --> 01:09:17,377
<i>I can not believe that.</i>

1085
01:09:18,086 --> 01:09:19,379
Guy is dead.

1086
01:09:20,213 --> 01:09:21,381
He is. He is dead.

1087
01:09:23,883 --> 01:09:25,051
Shit.

1088
01:09:30,181 --> 01:09:31,933
You have not to say, huh?

1089
01:09:32,016 --> 01:09:35,145
It's just another day
in the life of Jack Gramm.

1090
01:09:43,361 --> 01:09:44,529
Okay.

1091
01:09:46,322 --> 01:09:48,408
Can you wait outside the cab
for a minute?

1092
01:09:49,659 --> 01:09:51,202
- You bet.
- Thanks.

1093
01:09:56,291 --> 01:09:58,418
You asked me about
my kid sister.

1094
01:09:58,585 --> 01:10:00,503
Okay. It was a long time ago.

1095
01:10:00,754 --> 01:10:03,298
She was staying at my apartment
in New York City.

1096
01:10:03,506 --> 01:10:05,925
She was 12, I was 28.

1097
01:10:06,134 --> 01:10:09,095
And I was late for a meeting.
Very important meeting.

1098
01:10:09,471 --> 01:10:11,431
A meeting
that was gonna change my life.

1099
01:10:11,514 --> 01:10:14,309
It was gonna make me
into somebody important.

1100
01:10:15,643 --> 01:10:17,979
Make all my dreams come true,
so...

1101
01:10:18,188 --> 01:10:20,774
I went to this meeting
on my dissertation.

1102
01:10:21,149 --> 01:10:24,110
And I left her there by herself.

1103
01:10:24,652 --> 01:10:27,989
I could have taken her with me.
I could have left her with friends.

1104
01:10:28,073 --> 01:10:30,700
I could have postpone
the meeting.

1105
01:10:31,159 --> 01:10:34,079
But I chose not to,
because I was in a hurry.

1106
01:10:34,287 --> 01:10:36,373
Anyway, I left her there alone.

1107
01:10:36,581 --> 01:10:39,125
At that time I was working
in a case...

1108
01:10:39,334 --> 01:10:42,087
and this guy had strangled
six women.

1109
01:10:42,337 --> 01:10:44,798
We were very close to nail him.

1110
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:48,551
He was upset
and he wanted to get back at me.

1111
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:52,555
So he came to my apartment,
only I wasn't there.

1112
01:10:52,889 --> 01:10:56,351
And that time I wasn't concerned
with security.

1113
01:10:57,268 --> 01:10:59,771
I was careless so...

1114
01:11:02,273 --> 01:11:04,192
he broke the door down...

1115
01:11:04,234 --> 01:11:05,819
and he went in.

1116
01:11:07,612 --> 01:11:08,822
And did...

1117
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:11,157
things...

1118
01:11:11,741 --> 01:11:13,576
to my baby sister.

1119
01:11:14,703 --> 01:11:16,955
Katheryn, was her name.

1120
01:11:17,330 --> 01:11:18,498
Katy.

1121
01:11:19,290 --> 01:11:22,836
He did things that you wouldn't do
to an animal...

1122
01:11:22,919 --> 01:11:25,171
that was bred for slaughter.

1123
01:11:29,384 --> 01:11:30,510
Anyway...

1124
01:11:33,847 --> 01:11:35,473
when they caught him...

1125
01:11:36,307 --> 01:11:37,767
he laughed...

1126
01:11:39,227 --> 01:11:40,562
and said...

1127
01:11:41,896 --> 01:11:44,357
it took him 88 minutes...

1128
01:11:57,078 --> 01:12:00,206
it took him 88 minutes
to have my sister dead.

1129
01:12:00,248 --> 01:12:01,499
Jack...

1130
01:12:04,377 --> 01:12:06,337
He is in prison now.

1131
01:12:09,549 --> 01:12:12,260
Coming up for
his fifth parole hearing.

1132
01:12:13,470 --> 01:12:15,430
I left New York.

1133
01:12:15,638 --> 01:12:18,850
Left all that behind me
and came here, to Seattle.

1134
01:12:19,392 --> 01:12:22,479
You know,
it seemed the perfect place.

1135
01:12:23,688 --> 01:12:25,648
It's on the far off corner...

1136
01:12:27,150 --> 01:12:29,110
of the continent of USA.

1137
01:12:29,486 --> 01:12:32,155
To see if I had
a second hanged in me.

1138
01:12:35,617 --> 01:12:37,410
Whoever stole that tape...

1139
01:12:38,244 --> 01:12:40,580
knows the meaning of 88 minutes.

1140
01:12:46,419 --> 01:12:47,754
Is that enough?

1141
01:12:51,508 --> 01:12:52,675
Let's go.

1142
01:13:02,477 --> 01:13:05,063
If Sara is not home,
we don't have a search warrant.

1143
01:13:05,146 --> 01:13:07,690
Well, we don't need a search warrant.
We're not gonna arrest anybody.

1144
01:13:07,774 --> 01:13:09,567
We're just breaking in.

1145
01:13:14,322 --> 01:13:16,116
Not a good sign.

1146
01:13:19,285 --> 01:13:21,246
You can't say
I've never give you anything.

1147
01:13:21,496 --> 01:13:24,165
This looks familiar.
When did you take it?

1148
01:13:25,250 --> 01:13:27,043
I guess it doesn't matter,
does it?

1149
01:13:27,252 --> 01:13:28,670
It just might.

1150
01:13:32,882 --> 01:13:34,968
- Okay, check out that way.
- Okay.

1151
01:14:17,343 --> 01:14:18,094
Oh, Jesus.

1152
01:14:22,599 --> 01:14:23,933
What is it?

1153
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:26,936
Oh, my God.

1154
01:14:27,395 --> 01:14:29,022
Oh, my God!

1155
01:14:30,065 --> 01:14:31,149
Calm, Kim.

1156
01:14:31,232 --> 01:14:34,277
- Calm, Kim.
- Oh, my God. She is dead.

1157
01:14:34,986 --> 01:14:35,987
It's okay.

1158
01:14:36,071 --> 01:14:39,449
- Who would do that? Why?
- Calm, Kim.

1159
01:14:39,574 --> 01:14:42,327
- Who could torture someone like that?
- Just, breathe.

1160
01:14:43,912 --> 01:14:45,622
- Breathe, breathe.
- Okay.

1161
01:14:46,331 --> 01:14:47,957
- Breathe.
- Oh, God.

1162
01:14:48,041 --> 01:14:50,251
- Control. Take control.
- Okay.

1163
01:14:51,252 --> 01:14:52,879
I'm in control.

1164
01:14:53,088 --> 01:14:55,382
- Are you in control?
- Yeah.

1165
01:14:55,548 --> 01:14:57,842
- Okay, good. Let me show you something.
- Okay.

1166
01:14:59,010 --> 01:15:00,804
That is my signature.

1167
01:15:01,679 --> 01:15:04,682
Forged.
Credit card receipt.

1168
01:15:05,141 --> 01:15:07,352
This whole place
is filled with my DNA.

1169
01:15:07,685 --> 01:15:09,521
The police is gonna come here.

1170
01:15:09,771 --> 01:15:12,774
They gonna know I was with Sara.
They gonna think that I killed her.

1171
01:15:14,651 --> 01:15:15,777
- Your phone.
- Yeah.

1172
01:15:15,860 --> 01:15:17,320
Answer, Jack.

1173
01:15:19,781 --> 01:15:21,157
Yeah.

1174
01:15:21,449 --> 01:15:23,243
<i>- Jack?
- Carol?</i>

1175
01:15:23,952 --> 01:15:24,953
Carol?

1176
01:15:25,203 --> 01:15:28,164
Did you here the tape with
your sister's 88 minutes of suffering?

1177
01:15:28,581 --> 01:15:30,917
<i>I sent it to your apartment.</i>

1178
01:15:31,876 --> 01:15:34,129
What are you saying, Carol?
What is this?

1179
01:15:34,462 --> 01:15:36,256
The Porsche was a close call.

1180
01:15:37,674 --> 01:15:40,593
<i>I called Frank and told him
you murdered Sara after you killed Dale.</i>

1181
01:15:43,596 --> 01:15:45,265
<i>Think you are so smart...</i>

1182
01:15:45,724 --> 01:15:47,600
<i>invincible and unbeatable.</i>

1183
01:15:48,143 --> 01:15:52,147
<i>John Forster is giving you a death
sentence and he is about to be free.</i>

1184
01:15:52,981 --> 01:15:54,274
<i>How ironic.</i>

1185
01:15:55,483 --> 01:15:57,610
You've got 18 minutes left.

1186
01:15:58,153 --> 01:15:59,904
Meet me at your office alone.

1187
01:16:00,155 --> 01:16:01,656
<i>Tic-tac.</i>

1188
01:16:03,867 --> 01:16:05,160
What is it?

1189
01:16:05,243 --> 01:16:06,703
It's Carol.

1190
01:16:07,912 --> 01:16:11,458
She wants to meet me at the university,
at my office.

1191
01:16:12,792 --> 01:16:13,918
Let's go.

1192
01:16:14,502 --> 01:16:15,795
- Come on.
- Okay.

1193
01:16:34,064 --> 01:16:36,483
Shelley? What the hell
are you doing in here?

1194
01:16:37,484 --> 01:16:39,152
I need to talk to you.

1195
01:16:42,072 --> 01:16:45,158
That poor girl.
That poor... poor girl.

1196
01:16:47,827 --> 01:16:49,496
- It was me.
- Sit, sit.

1197
01:16:49,579 --> 01:16:52,248
- It was me.
- Shelley, sit down.

1198
01:16:53,666 --> 01:16:56,711
I broke the security protocol.

1199
01:16:59,547 --> 01:17:00,673
Why?

1200
01:17:02,967 --> 01:17:04,803
Well, about six weeks ago...

1201
01:17:04,886 --> 01:17:08,932
I had a drink in your office
with a student of yours.

1202
01:17:09,682 --> 01:17:10,642
<i>A couple of drinks, actually.</i>

1203
01:17:11,142 --> 01:17:15,271
And she made an advance,
and...

1204
01:17:16,731 --> 01:17:20,235
<i>It was late, but the office was
jammed with people working still.</i>

1205
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:26,741
<i>And when we woke up she left.
She didn't have a briefcase...</i>

1206
01:17:26,825 --> 01:17:28,910
she didn't have anything
she could put the tape in, but...

1207
01:17:28,993 --> 01:17:30,954
but somebody else must have.

1208
01:17:31,162 --> 01:17:34,082
Somebody else did,
while we're sleeping.

1209
01:17:34,290 --> 01:17:37,168
Who was this girl?
What's her name?

1210
01:17:39,212 --> 01:17:40,463
It was Lauren.

1211
01:17:41,631 --> 01:17:43,174
Lauren Douglas.

1212
01:17:46,761 --> 01:17:48,179
And here is the...

1213
01:17:49,305 --> 01:17:50,849
It's a picture
from the security cameras.

1214
01:17:50,932 --> 01:17:53,852
This is the person that must have
rifle through my files...

1215
01:17:53,935 --> 01:17:56,688
and found the combination
to your vault and took the tape.

1216
01:17:56,771 --> 01:17:59,107
That's not a person, Shelly.
It's a hat and a coat.

1217
01:17:59,357 --> 01:18:04,779
And this the photo ID of everyone that
has visited Forster on the last month.

1218
01:18:06,406 --> 01:18:07,449
Oh...

1219
01:18:09,117 --> 01:18:11,077
Can you ever forgive me?

1220
01:18:14,164 --> 01:18:16,207
If I can't forgive you, Shelley...

1221
01:18:17,083 --> 01:18:18,835
I don't deserve you.

1222
01:18:19,753 --> 01:18:21,004
Understand?

1223
01:18:24,883 --> 01:18:27,260
I want you to call Carol
and patch her through to me.

1224
01:18:27,343 --> 01:18:29,054
- Okay?
- Okay.

1225
01:18:30,346 --> 01:18:31,514
Kim?

1226
01:18:36,978 --> 01:18:38,229
Kim?

1227
01:18:40,648 --> 01:18:43,443
Hi, can you transfer me
to Lynn Johnson office, please?

1228
01:18:45,945 --> 01:18:47,197
Kim?

1229
01:18:49,657 --> 01:18:50,742
Kim?

1230
01:19:07,801 --> 01:19:09,010
Kim?

1231
01:19:14,849 --> 01:19:16,935
Where are you going in such a hurry,
Jack?

1232
01:19:17,143 --> 01:19:19,604
Is there something upstairs
that you don't want me to see?

1233
01:19:20,313 --> 01:19:23,566
There's a woman named Sara Pollard
upstairs very dead.

1234
01:19:23,650 --> 01:19:24,818
You can see her, if you'd like.

1235
01:19:25,110 --> 01:19:27,487
Look, I'm a straight shooter,
right, Jack?

1236
01:19:27,612 --> 01:19:29,406
- Yeah.
- And you'd never screw me over, right?

1237
01:19:29,531 --> 01:19:30,448
Oh, come on.

1238
01:19:30,532 --> 01:19:33,827
Why are your finger prints all over
Dale Morris apartment?

1239
01:19:35,078 --> 01:19:36,496
- They are?
- Yeah.

1240
01:19:36,705 --> 01:19:39,708
And you were right about the Halothane
on the blood stream.

1241
01:19:40,041 --> 01:19:43,962
What you failed to mention is the fact
that your semen is in her vagina cavity.

1242
01:19:44,212 --> 01:19:46,339
Is your semen in Sara Pollard?

1243
01:19:46,381 --> 01:19:48,883
Where the hell are you going
with this, Frank?

1244
01:19:49,050 --> 01:19:50,969
Can't you see this is a frame?

1245
01:19:51,177 --> 01:19:54,013
Forster is coordinating
this whole thing from prison.

1246
01:19:54,222 --> 01:19:55,890
- Can't you see that?
- Yeah, right.

1247
01:19:55,974 --> 01:19:59,227
It is Forster's semen on Sara Pollard
it's yours, Jack?

1248
01:19:59,436 --> 01:20:03,565
Somebody hired Sara Pollard
to be with me last night...

1249
01:20:03,815 --> 01:20:05,233
then killed her...

1250
01:20:05,608 --> 01:20:09,696
took my semen
and deposit into Dale Morris.

1251
01:20:09,904 --> 01:20:11,823
Do you have any idea
how absurd that sounds?

1252
01:20:11,906 --> 01:20:12,824
No, it's not absurd.

1253
01:20:13,074 --> 01:20:14,576
I don't have time to explain,
Frank.

1254
01:20:15,160 --> 01:20:16,244
Carol isn't answering.

1255
01:20:16,578 --> 01:20:17,662
What? What?

1256
01:20:17,912 --> 01:20:19,122
Carol isn't answering.

1257
01:20:20,206 --> 01:20:23,668
Get the names of all the women lawyers
who work for Forster.

1258
01:20:23,877 --> 01:20:25,170
I want their names and ages.

1259
01:20:25,378 --> 01:20:27,714
- Look, I know how you operate, Jack.
- What the hell are you doing?

1260
01:20:28,089 --> 01:20:29,799
I know how you use people.

1261
01:20:30,050 --> 01:20:32,886
It's no secret you're a womanizer,
you drink too much.

1262
01:20:33,136 --> 01:20:35,764
How do I know that you haven't gone
completely over the edge?

1263
01:20:35,847 --> 01:20:37,390
- Oh, man, I can't believe it!
- How do I know?

1264
01:20:37,474 --> 01:20:39,225
- I don't know what you do anymore.
- What did I do, Frank?

1265
01:20:39,559 --> 01:20:41,519
Did I send myself a tape?

1266
01:20:41,770 --> 01:20:44,898
Did I blow up my car?
Did I set my apartment on fire?

1267
01:20:45,106 --> 01:20:46,900
Did I fire bullets at myself?

1268
01:20:46,941 --> 01:20:49,069
For God sakes, Frank, wake up!

1269
01:20:49,277 --> 01:20:52,822
- What the hell... What are you doing?
- I have no idea who you're anymore.

1270
01:20:53,281 --> 01:20:54,741
You don't?

1271
01:20:54,949 --> 01:20:57,494
- I got Gramm. I'm bringing him in.
- No, you're not gonna do this.

1272
01:20:57,619 --> 01:21:00,914
Frank. Frank.
Just give me some time.

1273
01:21:01,039 --> 01:21:03,708
Just give me some time.
I can untangle this. Okay?

1274
01:21:03,917 --> 01:21:05,752
Just give me...
Here, give me some time.

1275
01:21:06,795 --> 01:21:09,089
Don't move
or I'll blow your head off.

1276
01:21:12,008 --> 01:21:14,260
Don't point a gun at me, Frank.

1277
01:21:14,844 --> 01:21:17,931
Don't point a gun at me.
Please.

1278
01:21:26,564 --> 01:21:29,275
I wanted to sync up our watches,
that's all.

1279
01:21:37,659 --> 01:21:38,827
All right, Jack.

1280
01:21:40,328 --> 01:21:41,746
What do you need?

1281
01:21:42,205 --> 01:21:45,166
I need time.
I need ten minutes. Okay?

1282
01:21:45,333 --> 01:21:47,127
Here, let's sync up now.

1283
01:21:49,170 --> 01:21:51,881
At 11:40, meet me at my office
at the university.

1284
01:22:06,229 --> 01:22:07,439
Kim? What happened?

1285
01:22:07,981 --> 01:22:11,735
<i>I know you're only trying to help me,
but don't go to my office on campus.</i>

1286
01:22:11,943 --> 01:22:14,988
<i>You understand? It's dangerous.
Don't be a hero.</i>

1287
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:18,616
When you get this message,
call me back A.S.A.P.

1288
01:22:18,700 --> 01:22:20,076
You understand? It's Jack.

1289
01:22:23,038 --> 01:22:24,330
Yeah.

1290
01:22:24,414 --> 01:22:26,833
<i>There's still no answer
at Johnson's office.</i>

1291
01:22:26,916 --> 01:22:29,002
Hold on. Yeah.

1292
01:22:29,252 --> 01:22:30,253
<i>- Jack?
- Kim...</i>

1293
01:22:30,336 --> 01:22:33,465
whatever you do, don't go to my office
on the campus. Do you understand?

1294
01:22:33,715 --> 01:22:35,216
You have 14 minutes.

1295
01:22:36,342 --> 01:22:37,343
What?

1296
01:22:37,427 --> 01:22:39,512
<i>It was me, Jack.
I set you up.</i>

1297
01:22:40,263 --> 01:22:42,390
I had a computer dialing service
call you up...

1298
01:22:42,474 --> 01:22:45,101
rearranging times,
using electronic altered voice.

1299
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:47,687
Kim, this is no time to joke.

1300
01:22:47,896 --> 01:22:50,231
Meet me in your office
in ten minutes, Jack.

1301
01:22:50,440 --> 01:22:52,400
11:40. Don't be late.

1302
01:22:52,650 --> 01:22:53,651
Kim!

1303
01:22:55,028 --> 01:22:56,029
Kim!

1304
01:23:31,523 --> 01:23:32,899
Oh, shit.

1305
01:23:38,279 --> 01:23:39,406
Man...

1306
01:23:46,621 --> 01:23:47,414
Yeah.

1307
01:23:47,497 --> 01:23:50,417
<i>Hey, Jack, I got the names
of the women on Forster's legal team.</i>

1308
01:23:50,625 --> 01:23:51,918
They were three.

1309
01:23:52,043 --> 01:23:56,756
Hannah Baker, 53.
Rosane Caputto, 47, and...

1310
01:23:56,965 --> 01:23:58,216
Lydia Doherty, 28.

1311
01:23:58,508 --> 01:24:00,760
And Lydia Doherty, 28.
How did you know?

1312
01:24:00,969 --> 01:24:03,012
Cause her name is on the signature sheet
you gave me.

1313
01:24:03,304 --> 01:24:05,557
I want you to do a search
on Lydia Doherty.

1314
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:07,809
I want you to get all the information
you can.

1315
01:24:08,059 --> 01:24:11,479
<i>Fax it to my office on campus.
Okay? Do it now.</i>

1316
01:24:31,624 --> 01:24:33,418
Hey, another hundred bucks
and I'll wait.

1317
01:25:15,877 --> 01:25:17,337
What the hell
are you doing in here?

1318
01:25:19,130 --> 01:25:21,466
This is Lauren Douglas bag.

1319
01:25:22,592 --> 01:25:25,136
It was stolen today.
I found it in your desk.

1320
01:25:27,097 --> 01:25:28,390
Halothane.

1321
01:25:29,224 --> 01:25:30,683
What is it doing here?

1322
01:25:31,017 --> 01:25:32,477
What are you doing in here?

1323
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:34,396
This is what you used
to kill Dale and Sara?

1324
01:25:34,604 --> 01:25:36,606
Or do you have no idea
about this too?

1325
01:25:37,524 --> 01:25:38,483
Oh, sure I do.

1326
01:25:38,566 --> 01:25:41,986
I left all this stuff in my desk
so you'd come along and find it.

1327
01:25:42,237 --> 01:25:43,947
You convinced the jury
that Forster was guilty.

1328
01:25:44,030 --> 01:25:45,573
How do I know you didn't kill
these women too?

1329
01:25:45,657 --> 01:25:46,616
Who sent you here?

1330
01:25:48,076 --> 01:25:49,703
Yeah.
I'd like to report a suspect...

1331
01:25:49,744 --> 01:25:51,287
- in the Seattle Slayer case.
- What the hell...

1332
01:25:51,371 --> 01:25:52,872
- Dr. Jack Gramm.
- Put down the goddamn phone!

1333
01:25:52,956 --> 01:25:54,833
What's the matter with you?
Who sent you here?

1334
01:25:54,999 --> 01:25:56,710
You think I'm too dumb
to figure it out from myself?

1335
01:25:56,751 --> 01:25:57,711
Yes, I do.

1336
01:25:57,794 --> 01:26:02,048
Because whoever sent you here is deeply
involved in the Slayer killings.

1337
01:26:02,298 --> 01:26:03,466
Lydia Doherty.

1338
01:26:03,883 --> 01:26:06,177
- Lydia Doherty.
- What the hell is that?

1339
01:26:09,597 --> 01:26:10,515
Yeah?

1340
01:26:10,598 --> 01:26:12,016
<i>Come to the Stern Building now.</i>

1341
01:26:12,267 --> 01:26:14,060
Corner office, seventh floor.

1342
01:26:14,602 --> 01:26:15,729
<i>Alone.</i>

1343
01:26:18,273 --> 01:26:19,691
You have five minutes, Jack.

1344
01:26:21,776 --> 01:26:23,778
- What are you doing?
- I'm not moving.

1345
01:26:24,738 --> 01:26:27,824
I don't have time to explain this.

1346
01:26:28,033 --> 01:26:29,200
Get away from the door.

1347
01:26:29,284 --> 01:26:30,660
- Come on!
- You're gonna shoot me?

1348
01:26:35,957 --> 01:26:37,000
Yeah.

1349
01:26:39,294 --> 01:26:40,795
I'm a bad shot.

1350
01:26:43,673 --> 01:26:46,634
Frank, when you get this message
I'm gonna be at the Stern Building...

1351
01:26:46,676 --> 01:26:49,387
on the seventh floor.
Get there as soon as you can.

1352
01:28:48,256 --> 01:28:49,549
Oh, God.

1353
01:28:50,842 --> 01:28:52,844
Punctual, Dr. Gramm.

1354
01:28:54,179 --> 01:28:57,265
I'm gonna give you a B+
for effort.

1355
01:28:57,557 --> 01:29:00,852
Lynn Johnson is indisposed, but
I'm sure she'd say hello, if she could.

1356
01:29:01,061 --> 01:29:04,397
As for your old friend, Kim,
she didn't quite make the grade.

1357
01:29:04,439 --> 01:29:06,024
- Lydia.
- You got the name right.

1358
01:29:06,107 --> 01:29:09,069
Lydia Doherty.
Copy cat murderer.

1359
01:29:09,277 --> 01:29:11,571
God, I wish Forster
could see your face.

1360
01:29:11,654 --> 01:29:13,490
You look so totally clueless.

1361
01:29:17,619 --> 01:29:19,829
I hope that's not a gun
you're holding.

1362
01:29:20,789 --> 01:29:22,999
Is that a gun, Dr. Gramm?

1363
01:29:23,625 --> 01:29:24,709
What do you want?

1364
01:29:25,001 --> 01:29:26,419
Is that a gun?

1365
01:29:27,253 --> 01:29:29,714
- I have a gun.
- Then do this.

1366
01:29:31,216 --> 01:29:32,759
Put it on the floor...

1367
01:29:33,635 --> 01:29:35,345
and slide it to me.

1368
01:29:37,639 --> 01:29:38,932
To me.

1369
01:29:42,477 --> 01:29:43,561
Okay.

1370
01:29:48,358 --> 01:29:49,401
Okay.

1371
01:29:51,319 --> 01:29:52,695
You slide it.

1372
01:30:02,080 --> 01:30:04,332
One more time, slide it to me.

1373
01:30:09,671 --> 01:30:10,755
Slowly.

1374
01:30:12,173 --> 01:30:13,466
And move back.

1375
01:30:19,973 --> 01:30:20,807
Better.

1376
01:30:43,997 --> 01:30:46,207
I'd like to talk to John Forster,
please.

1377
01:30:46,291 --> 01:30:48,168
This is his appeal attorney,
Lydia Doherty.

1378
01:30:49,044 --> 01:30:51,046
They monitor his calls.

1379
01:30:52,422 --> 01:30:54,758
- You gonna implicate him.
- The brilliant Dr. Gramm...

1380
01:30:54,841 --> 01:30:56,801
and his psycho gamble,
is that it?

1381
01:30:59,929 --> 01:31:01,890
<i>Sorry for the trouble I caused,
Dr. Gram.</i>

1382
01:31:02,724 --> 01:31:05,226
<i>You know that I did, Dr. Gramm,
with honors.</i>

1383
01:31:05,477 --> 01:31:08,855
<i>Dale told me how good you're
with her when her dad died.</i>

1384
01:31:09,105 --> 01:31:10,482
<i>She was so grateful.</i>

1385
01:31:11,066 --> 01:31:13,359
<i>But despite the fact that insanity
is a legal concept...</i>

1386
01:31:13,401 --> 01:31:15,820
<i>it doesn't mean
that someone is not sick.</i>

1387
01:31:28,666 --> 01:31:30,085
Have him call me on my cell.

1388
01:31:31,336 --> 01:31:32,879
He knows the number.

1389
01:31:34,923 --> 01:31:38,176
- What do you want?
- What about you start with a confession?

1390
01:31:38,927 --> 01:31:41,388
- I confess.
- To what?

1391
01:31:41,679 --> 01:31:43,556
To what? To everything.

1392
01:31:44,224 --> 01:31:45,809
I confess.

1393
01:31:53,191 --> 01:31:55,902
I want you to speak clearly
and I want the truth.

1394
01:31:55,944 --> 01:31:57,570
Where do I start?

1395
01:31:57,779 --> 01:31:59,948
- Janie Kay.
- Janie Kay?

1396
01:32:00,156 --> 01:32:01,616
I coached her.

1397
01:32:02,701 --> 01:32:03,993
Shut it off.

1398
01:32:05,662 --> 01:32:07,872
- Shut it off.
- I am.

1399
01:32:10,875 --> 01:32:12,085
Go again.

1400
01:32:12,836 --> 01:32:15,422
I coached Janie Kay.

1401
01:32:15,714 --> 01:32:17,882
- In what trial?
- I coached Janie Kay...

1402
01:32:17,966 --> 01:32:22,178
in John Forster's trial. I coached her.
She perjured herself.

1403
01:32:22,637 --> 01:32:24,556
I gave false testimony.

1404
01:32:25,640 --> 01:32:28,226
And John Forster was convicted.

1405
01:32:28,435 --> 01:32:30,603
Based on an unlawful testimony.

1406
01:32:30,812 --> 01:32:32,272
Based on an unlawful testimony.

1407
01:32:34,899 --> 01:32:36,860
It's my little present for John.

1408
01:32:37,068 --> 01:32:38,027
Thank you.

1409
01:32:42,657 --> 01:32:43,825
What are you doing?

1410
01:32:44,367 --> 01:32:45,744
Are you assessing me?

1411
01:32:47,996 --> 01:32:50,290
Are you looking for a weakness,
Dr. Gramm?

1412
01:32:50,498 --> 01:32:53,543
I'm just wondering what is next.

1413
01:32:56,629 --> 01:32:58,757
Aren't you gonna offer
to make me a deal?

1414
01:32:59,507 --> 01:33:01,634
Sacrifice yourself
for Kim and Carol?

1415
01:33:02,927 --> 01:33:04,304
Be the hero.

1416
01:33:04,721 --> 01:33:08,266
Well, that wouldn't fly out, would it?
I'd offer, but it wouldn't fly.

1417
01:33:08,516 --> 01:33:09,309
Rejected.

1418
01:33:10,268 --> 01:33:12,020
Have any other moves?

1419
01:33:13,563 --> 01:33:15,982
Or you spent so quickly...

1420
01:33:16,149 --> 01:33:20,945
I could move my eyes, like this,
e look behind you.

1421
01:33:22,364 --> 01:33:24,741
To see if there is someone there
with a gun pointed to your head.

1422
01:33:27,827 --> 01:33:30,288
- How much time I got left?
- You have about a minute.

1423
01:33:31,956 --> 01:33:32,832
Jack.

1424
01:33:33,083 --> 01:33:35,794
Enough time for your last words.
I'm not gonna deny you those.

1425
01:33:37,295 --> 01:33:39,506
All this torture,
all this torment...

1426
01:33:40,965 --> 01:33:42,092
for an infatuation?

1427
01:33:42,217 --> 01:33:44,302
It's not an infatuation,
don't demean me.

1428
01:33:45,220 --> 01:33:47,680
Well, if it's not an infatuation
what is it?

1429
01:33:49,933 --> 01:33:51,309
Stop, please!

1430
01:34:08,118 --> 01:34:10,787
<i>I went through great lengths
to pull this off.</i>

1431
01:34:12,205 --> 01:34:14,666
<i>John really appreciates
the quality of my work.</i>

1432
01:34:15,333 --> 01:34:16,418
<i>Timing the phone calls...</i>

1433
01:34:16,793 --> 01:34:19,838
<i>perfecting the ropes and plus
implicating everyone close to you.</i>

1434
01:34:20,088 --> 01:34:22,048
Coaching Carol and Kim.

1435
01:34:23,007 --> 01:34:24,718
All the while staying invisible.

1436
01:34:24,926 --> 01:34:26,678
<i>It was me, Jack. I set you up.</i>

1437
01:34:26,928 --> 01:34:28,722
You know what I don't understand?

1438
01:34:28,930 --> 01:34:33,184
How, in God's name,
does anybody give up their free will?

1439
01:34:33,601 --> 01:34:34,936
How you do that?

1440
01:34:35,019 --> 01:34:37,188
- 45 seconds.
- I saw you.

1441
01:34:37,272 --> 01:34:40,108
You came to my class,
I remember you.

1442
01:34:40,358 --> 01:34:42,944
You were intelligent.
An individual.

1443
01:34:43,236 --> 01:34:44,487
You challenged things.

1444
01:34:44,571 --> 01:34:47,073
You challenged me.
You challenged ideas.

1445
01:34:47,574 --> 01:34:49,200
You're your own person.

1446
01:34:49,451 --> 01:34:54,414
How could you ever allowed yourself
to be so manipulated by this guy?

1447
01:34:54,622 --> 01:34:55,623
30 seconds.

1448
01:34:55,665 --> 01:34:57,208
You're gonna take the fall
for this guy?

1449
01:34:57,375 --> 01:34:59,919
If that's what he wants,
so be it.

1450
01:35:00,420 --> 01:35:02,088
You see, Jacko...

1451
01:35:02,672 --> 01:35:03,882
I'm a true believer.

1452
01:35:03,965 --> 01:35:06,259
You better believe
that's an FBI agent...

1453
01:35:06,301 --> 01:35:08,636
with a gun pointed right
into your head...

1454
01:35:08,720 --> 01:35:09,763
at this moment.

1455
01:35:10,638 --> 01:35:11,639
Believe it.

1456
01:35:11,848 --> 01:35:14,267
- No more kidding.
- Believe it.

1457
01:35:15,685 --> 01:35:17,479
- Believe it.
- I believe your time is up...

1458
01:35:17,562 --> 01:35:19,022
Dr. Gramm.

1459
01:35:33,787 --> 01:35:35,121
God.

1460
01:35:36,748 --> 01:35:38,041
Jack!

1461
01:35:40,168 --> 01:35:41,503
Jack!

1462
01:35:41,586 --> 01:35:42,545
No!

1463
01:35:46,216 --> 01:35:47,300
Jack!

1464
01:35:47,592 --> 01:35:48,802
Jack!

1465
01:35:55,392 --> 01:35:56,601
No!

1466
01:35:56,810 --> 01:35:57,894
Jack!

1467
01:35:58,186 --> 01:35:59,270
No!

1468
01:35:59,687 --> 01:36:00,730
Jack!

1469
01:36:01,648 --> 01:36:02,816
No!

1470
01:36:06,319 --> 01:36:07,445
No!

1471
01:36:44,023 --> 01:36:45,108
Again!

1472
01:36:55,243 --> 01:36:57,162
I got you. I got you.

1473
01:36:57,579 --> 01:36:58,663
It's okay.

1474
01:36:58,747 --> 01:36:59,873
It's okay, sweetheart.

1475
01:37:03,168 --> 01:37:05,170
Requesting immediately MT help.

1476
01:37:05,420 --> 01:37:08,423
At the UNW Campus,
Stern Building.

1477
01:37:08,882 --> 01:37:10,133
I repeat.

1478
01:37:10,300 --> 01:37:13,261
Immediately emergency
medical technician.

1479
01:37:13,845 --> 01:37:15,764
Multiple stab wounds.

1480
01:37:18,975 --> 01:37:20,143
There you go.

1481
01:37:21,811 --> 01:37:24,022
That's okay.
Don't move.

1482
01:37:40,955 --> 01:37:41,581
Yeah.

1483
01:37:41,664 --> 01:37:44,709
<i>This is officer Finnegan
from the State Penitentiary Walla Walla.</i>

1484
01:37:44,876 --> 01:37:47,879
<i>I'm placing a call from John Forster
to his attorney Lydia Doherty.</i>

1485
01:37:47,962 --> 01:37:49,255
Put him through.

1486
01:37:50,215 --> 01:37:51,549
<i>Go ahead.</i>

1487
01:37:51,633 --> 01:37:52,759
Lydia.

1488
01:37:54,010 --> 01:37:55,428
Did you finish with Gramm?

1489
01:37:55,637 --> 01:37:58,014
- She's downstairs.
- Gramm?

1490
01:38:01,309 --> 01:38:02,602
Put my attorney on the phone,
please.

1491
01:38:02,852 --> 01:38:03,895
She's indisposed.

1492
01:38:04,145 --> 01:38:06,064
Look, you're meddling her.
You shouldn't be meddling in.

1493
01:38:06,314 --> 01:38:10,985
You seized a naive junior lawyer
on your legal staff.

1494
01:38:11,653 --> 01:38:14,447
<i>You realized that she's damaged
psychologically and...</i>

1495
01:38:14,489 --> 01:38:15,240
Genius, isn't it?

1496
01:38:15,490 --> 01:38:18,034
Susceptible to your craps.
And what you do?

1497
01:38:18,243 --> 01:38:19,786
You get her to kill people for you.

1498
01:38:19,994 --> 01:38:21,413
So you can stay alive.

1499
01:38:21,663 --> 01:38:24,457
That's an innovative legal strategy,
if I have ever heard of any.

1500
01:38:24,666 --> 01:38:27,460
Dr. Gramm, I'm flattered
with your imagination.

1501
01:38:28,169 --> 01:38:29,295
But you're grasping in straw.

1502
01:38:29,462 --> 01:38:32,173
She becomes a student of mine,
no less...

1503
01:38:32,465 --> 01:38:35,635
you keep her on the appeal process,
but she's still your lawyer...

1504
01:38:35,719 --> 01:38:38,138
so she has unlimited access
to you...

1505
01:38:38,346 --> 01:38:41,516
so you can plan
your copy cat murders together.

1506
01:38:41,850 --> 01:38:44,018
And then you can get a new trial.

1507
01:38:44,102 --> 01:38:46,646
And live happily ever after.
Isn't that the case?

1508
01:38:46,813 --> 01:38:50,066
Dr. Gramm, I want you to listen
very closely...

1509
01:38:50,859 --> 01:38:52,902
because when I get out of here...

1510
01:38:53,528 --> 01:38:55,488
I'm gonna go out and
have a nice meal...

1511
01:38:56,156 --> 01:38:57,866
stop by your grave...

1512
01:38:58,700 --> 01:39:00,493
and piss all over it.

1513
01:39:01,870 --> 01:39:04,372
Now, please, put my angelical attorney
on the phone.

1514
01:39:04,622 --> 01:39:05,331
She's dead.

1515
01:39:06,583 --> 01:39:08,376
<i>It's over, Forster.</i>

1516
01:39:08,626 --> 01:39:10,503
<i>Except for the clock,
that goes tic-tac.</i>

1517
01:39:10,754 --> 01:39:13,465
Tic-tac.
You got 12 hours to live.

1518
01:39:47,290 --> 01:39:49,209
All right, fellows...

1519
01:39:55,298 --> 01:39:57,217
- How is Lynn Johnson?
- Well...

1520
01:39:57,467 --> 01:40:02,013
She just threw out of the house.
She didn't want me to be late for class.

1521
01:40:02,430 --> 01:40:04,349
Jack, I have to ask you
something.

1522
01:40:04,432 --> 01:40:07,394
Was Lydia telling the truth?
Did you coach Janie?

1523
01:40:07,769 --> 01:40:11,356
You believe Forster killed those people?
All those people?

1524
01:40:11,481 --> 01:40:14,275
- Yes.
- Janie's sister and everybody?

1525
01:40:14,359 --> 01:40:16,319
- Yes.
- Beyond reasonable doubt?

1526
01:40:16,528 --> 01:40:19,906
- Absolutely.
- What would you have done in my shoes?

1527
01:40:21,449 --> 01:40:22,617
Don't answer it.

1528
01:40:22,826 --> 01:40:24,077
Think about it.

1529
01:40:24,452 --> 01:40:25,704
Justice...

1530
01:40:26,287 --> 01:40:27,580
and truth.

1531
01:40:29,124 --> 01:40:30,750
Where do they intersect?

1532
01:40:47,684 --> 01:40:48,601
Hi.

1533
01:40:53,940 --> 01:40:55,358
Hello, everyone.

1534
01:41:00,572 --> 01:41:02,407
John Forster is dead.

1535
01:41:04,868 --> 01:41:07,829
<i>His execution is not a cause...</i>

1536
01:41:08,997 --> 01:41:10,457
<i>for celebration.</i>

1537
01:41:11,249 --> 01:41:13,668
<i>Nor is a vindication.</i>

1538
01:41:14,335 --> 01:41:17,172
<i>It is a chapter...</i>

1539
01:41:18,631 --> 01:41:21,426
<i>in the road to justice
and recovery.</i>

1540
01:41:23,762 --> 01:41:25,263
I personally...

1541
01:41:27,640 --> 01:41:29,768
don't believe
in capital punishment.

1542
01:41:32,604 --> 01:41:33,897
I do believe...

1543
01:41:34,981 --> 01:41:37,650
in the rights of the victims.

1544
01:41:39,402 --> 01:41:40,904
<i>I do believe...</i>

1545
01:41:41,946 --> 01:41:44,366
<i>that they deserve recompense.</i>

1546
01:41:44,616 --> 01:41:49,662
<i>No matter how significant
or insignificant it may be...</i>

1547
01:41:50,038 --> 01:41:52,499
in comparison
to the loss suffered.

1548
01:41:55,168 --> 01:41:57,253
I've suffered such a loss.

1549
01:41:59,172 --> 01:42:01,508
And like some of you here...

1550
01:42:02,384 --> 01:42:05,136
I've spent
those sleepless nights...

1551
01:42:06,888 --> 01:42:08,932
trying desperately to...

1552
01:42:10,517 --> 01:42:14,312
squelch down that
bullish instinct for revenge.

1553
01:42:17,565 --> 01:42:19,943
<i>And I have wondered...</i>

1554
01:42:20,276 --> 01:42:22,487
<i>Jack, look at me.
Look at the kite.</i>

1555
01:42:23,363 --> 01:42:24,864
<i>If this pain will...</i>

1556
01:42:26,157 --> 01:42:29,035
<i>- ever abate.
- Smile!</i>

1557
01:42:30,745 --> 01:42:32,205
<i>I've learnt...</i>

1558
01:42:33,289 --> 01:42:37,335
<i>that time does not heal
the wound.</i>

1559
01:42:38,503 --> 01:42:41,214
<i>It will though, in its most...</i>

1560
01:42:42,716 --> 01:42:44,592
merciful way...

1561
01:42:48,054 --> 01:42:50,432
plant the edge ever so slightly.

1562
01:42:57,605 --> 01:42:58,940
So...

1563
01:43:07,323 --> 01:43:09,409
What is the first thing...

1564
01:43:09,617 --> 01:43:13,163
one should remember
when entering a court room?

1565
01:43:14,305 --> 01:43:20,846
