00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:06,837
MAREBITO
The Stranger from Afar

4
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:53,841
I'm certain
that he's a substance abuser.

5
00:03:54,933 --> 00:03:58,745
Or is it a woman?

6
00:03:59,966 --> 00:04:04,540
Living in a small apartment,
with her paranoia.

7
00:04:05,533 --> 00:04:09,003
Her paranoia is of little interest to me.

8
00:04:09,066 --> 00:04:10,773
But I can say this:

9
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:13,939
By looking at her through the lens,

10
00:04:13,999 --> 00:04:18,846
I believe that I've salvaged her soul.

11
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:22,746
A tragedy occurred
at a subway station.

12
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:28,840
Shot by freelance cameraman,
Takuyoshi Masuoka,

13
00:04:28,933 --> 00:04:32,005
who happened to be at the scene
of a bizarre suicide earlier today.

14
00:04:32,066 --> 00:04:37,914
He captured the scene
in close proximity.

15
00:04:37,966 --> 00:04:40,606
Don't do it. Calm down.

16
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:59,779
Keep out of here!

17
00:05:01,299 --> 00:05:04,337
Let go of the knife!

18
00:05:07,499 --> 00:05:09,945
Calm down!

19
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,274
Arei Kuroki

20
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:40,214
was without a steady income,
just like me.

21
00:05:40,266 --> 00:05:43,509
He was paying no attention
to anybody at the site.

22
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:46,907
He was too terrified to notice them.

23
00:05:48,266 --> 00:05:50,746
Did he stab himself in the eye

24
00:05:50,799 --> 00:05:53,302
to avoid seeing
what terrified him?

25
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:05,280
I want to see

26
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:07,335
what he saw then.

27
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:15,669
Among the images I'd captured

28
00:06:15,733 --> 00:06:18,577
there were strange images

29
00:06:18,633 --> 00:06:21,671
that looked like ghosts or UFOs.

30
00:06:21,733 --> 00:06:24,873
Things both strange and mysterious.

31
00:06:24,933 --> 00:06:27,914
But they mean nothing to me,

32
00:06:29,066 --> 00:06:30,977
probably because

33
00:06:31,033 --> 00:06:35,778
these things have already
been defined as strange.

34
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:38,879
Seeing these images

35
00:06:38,933 --> 00:06:43,177
makes the viewer feel anxious,

36
00:06:43,233 --> 00:06:46,077
unlike the look of absolute fear
on that man's face

37
00:06:46,133 --> 00:06:47,737
as he killed himself.

38
00:06:55,766 --> 00:06:57,473
Even if this is really

39
00:06:57,533 --> 00:07:01,447
a person actually dying,

40
00:07:01,499 --> 00:07:04,571
the terror on her face

41
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:06,442
doesn't seem quite real.

42
00:07:08,366 --> 00:07:10,710
If the ultimate terror

43
00:07:10,766 --> 00:07:16,375
is to have your own mind
and body destroyed by others.

44
00:07:17,433 --> 00:07:20,676
I'd go so far as
to imitate a psychopath

45
00:07:20,733 --> 00:07:24,237
to record the terror
of the victim on my retina

46
00:07:24,299 --> 00:07:27,803
and video tape.

47
00:08:27,566 --> 00:08:32,345
I did not feel
that sense of terror at all.

48
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:29,542
What is she looking at?

49
00:10:07,933 --> 00:10:13,212
What was he watching
that was so terrifying?

50
00:11:17,699 --> 00:11:20,145
The answer was underground...

51
00:11:56,999 --> 00:12:00,037
I quit taking the Prozac

52
00:12:00,099 --> 00:12:03,080
to control my serotonin level.

53
00:12:04,366 --> 00:12:07,142
I have to stay focused.

54
00:12:07,199 --> 00:12:11,272
Otherwise I won't see
what I'm dying to see.

55
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:19,011
They weren't terrified
to see whatever they saw.

56
00:12:19,066 --> 00:12:22,309
They saw something
because they were terrified.

57
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:25,745
I had it all wrong.

58
00:12:31,499 --> 00:12:35,311
<i>I was with a documentary TV crew
on that day.</i>

59
00:12:35,366 --> 00:12:39,041
<i>We were on our way back from a shoot.</i>

60
00:13:08,033 --> 00:13:10,946
<i>Now I'm back at the scene,</i>

61
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:13,570
<i>and I realize that the image on the TV</i>

62
00:13:13,633 --> 00:13:15,943
<i>is more realistic.</i>

63
00:13:16,899 --> 00:13:19,971
<i>What did Kuroki see?</i>

64
00:13:35,133 --> 00:13:37,272
<i>Do I have the courage</i>

65
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:40,212
<i>to open the door to the passageway of terror?</i>

66
00:13:41,133 --> 00:13:45,309
<i>Can I face terror
from which the only escape</i>

67
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,710
<i>is to kill myself?</i>

68
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:51,540
<i>Fear of the unknown</i>

69
00:16:51,599 --> 00:16:53,545
<i>compels me to open the door.</i>

70
00:18:18,266 --> 00:18:20,371
<i>These stairs were built</i>

71
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:23,380
<i>not so long ago.</i>

72
00:18:23,433 --> 00:18:24,912
<i>Beneath Tokyo</i>

73
00:18:24,966 --> 00:18:27,845
<i>lay hidden tunnels
and passageways.</i>

74
00:18:27,899 --> 00:18:30,778
<i>It's a well-known urban myth.</i>

75
00:18:32,066 --> 00:18:35,912
<i>But obviously
it's not just</i> a <i>myth.</i>

76
00:19:09,366 --> 00:19:11,573
<i>The underground development</i>

77
00:19:11,633 --> 00:19:14,876
<i>was a reminder of the Second World War.</i>

78
00:19:16,066 --> 00:19:20,640
<i>This must be one such war time memorabilia.</i>

79
00:19:42,733 --> 00:19:43,837
Stay away!

80
00:19:45,233 --> 00:19:46,837
Sorry to bother you.

81
00:19:47,899 --> 00:19:51,472
<i>Homeless people usually stay
in populated areas.</i>

82
00:19:51,533 --> 00:19:55,242
<i>But not this one.
He rejects society completely.</i>

83
00:19:55,299 --> 00:20:00,715
<i>Why is he so alarmed?
What's he scared of?</i>

84
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:02,939
<i>It's so safe down here...</i>

85
00:20:02,999 --> 00:20:04,444
Safe?

86
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:11,802
It's not safe at all.

87
00:20:14,433 --> 00:20:15,707
W-Why not?

88
00:20:22,599 --> 00:20:25,546
Because of the Deros.

89
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:27,804
Deros?

90
00:20:29,733 --> 00:20:32,111
If they find you...

91
00:20:33,499 --> 00:20:36,503
they'll suck your blood dry.

92
00:20:47,466 --> 00:20:51,312
<i>He is definitely haunted by terror.</i>

93
00:20:55,933 --> 00:21:00,507
<i>The underground development of Tokyo</i>

94
00:21:00,566 --> 00:21:03,445
<i>was not just from the Second World War.</i>

95
00:21:04,266 --> 00:21:07,975
<i>It must have been done
throughout history.</i>

96
00:21:09,033 --> 00:21:11,070
<i>Connecting new tunnels</i>

97
00:21:11,133 --> 00:21:14,580
<i>with old ones.</i>

98
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:43,806
<i>Who's beyond the wall?</i>

99
00:21:43,866 --> 00:21:45,903
<i>Who hides behind it'?</i>

100
00:21:48,233 --> 00:21:51,646
<i>I've crossed the boundary
to the netherworld alive.</i>

101
00:21:51,699 --> 00:21:55,841
<i>It must mean that I'm sufficiently terrified.</i>

102
00:21:57,099 --> 00:21:59,943
<i>I've been invited here.</i>

103
00:22:11,933 --> 00:22:14,675
<i>Invited by who?... And why?</i>

104
00:22:20,133 --> 00:22:23,671
<i>I'm too exhausted to think straight.</i>

105
00:22:23,733 --> 00:22:28,648
<i>I'm not sure if I can make
logical conclusions.</i>

106
00:22:43,333 --> 00:22:45,438
I haven't seen you around.

107
00:22:47,066 --> 00:22:48,739
Are you new here?

108
00:22:50,666 --> 00:22:54,239
This must be the netherworld.

109
00:22:57,433 --> 00:23:01,313
Many think that beneath the earth
is the netherworld.

110
00:23:01,366 --> 00:23:04,813
It's because they don't know
what's underneath.

111
00:23:05,833 --> 00:23:08,143
It's widely conceived

112
00:23:08,266 --> 00:23:10,872
as the world beyond.

113
00:23:12,366 --> 00:23:16,746
Mr. Kuroki,
you're a talkative ghost, aren't you?

114
00:23:29,933 --> 00:23:33,244
Do you think I'm really a ghost?

115
00:23:34,233 --> 00:23:37,009
My name is actually Kuroki.

116
00:23:39,099 --> 00:23:41,170
Have we met?

117
00:23:41,233 --> 00:23:42,473
No.

118
00:23:43,466 --> 00:23:47,608
You haven't seen me before
but I've seen you.

119
00:23:47,666 --> 00:23:51,773
I saw you through
the videocamera's viewfinder.

120
00:23:56,766 --> 00:24:02,114
You are different from those
who come here to escape.

121
00:24:03,533 --> 00:24:05,513
I just saw one of them.

122
00:24:11,133 --> 00:24:14,342
I saw him back there.

123
00:24:14,399 --> 00:24:19,610
But I don't think I'm all that
different from these people.

124
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:30,670
I didn't know that Tokyo had

125
00:24:30,733 --> 00:24:34,010
such a developed
subterranean complex.

126
00:24:34,066 --> 00:24:36,205
It's not just Tokyo.

127
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:40,305
Populated places all over the world

128
00:24:40,366 --> 00:24:43,210
all have access
to the underground world.

129
00:24:45,199 --> 00:24:48,408
Are you referring
to the Hollow Earth Theory?

130
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:51,272
As you know,

131
00:24:51,399 --> 00:24:55,074
there are two versions
of the theory.

132
00:24:55,900 --> 00:25:00,906
One version is that the earth
is hollow, like an eggshell.

133
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:05,312
Another view is that there is
a complex subterranean system.

134
00:25:05,366 --> 00:25:09,371
I'm short of evidence
to support the former version.

135
00:25:09,433 --> 00:25:13,973
The latter seems true,
as we stand in that very complex.

136
00:25:15,633 --> 00:25:20,309
Entrances to the subterranean world
do exist in South America.

137
00:25:20,366 --> 00:25:22,505
It's a well-known fact

138
00:25:22,566 --> 00:25:25,945
that underneath Brussels
lays a subterranean city.

139
00:25:25,999 --> 00:25:28,240
Below the Patala shrine in Tibet

140
00:25:28,299 --> 00:25:31,644
there's a utopia called Shamballa,

141
00:25:31,699 --> 00:25:33,975
a very well-accepted idea.

142
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:37,742
And Agartha is its capital...

143
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:41,611
It's history as foreseen
by Madame Blavatsky.

144
00:25:45,066 --> 00:25:49,446
By the way, the under dweller
I stumbled upon earlier--

145
00:25:49,566 --> 00:25:52,479
he was very afraid of the Deros.

146
00:25:53,799 --> 00:25:57,008
It's short for
"detrimental robots".

147
00:25:58,333 --> 00:26:00,779
They are indeed dangerous.

148
00:26:00,833 --> 00:26:04,508
They can hardly see
but, like dogs, they hear well.

149
00:26:04,566 --> 00:26:06,546
You'd better be careful.

150
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:10,076
I'm beginning to remember...

151
00:26:10,133 --> 00:26:14,445
Is it the creature
described by Richard Shaver

152
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:18,414
in the fantasy book
he wrote in the 20s'?

153
00:26:18,466 --> 00:26:21,140
It was a book of fiction,

154
00:26:21,199 --> 00:26:25,545
until the book turned out
to be a prophecy.

155
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,978
Then fiction was no longer fiction.

156
00:26:30,766 --> 00:26:32,712
I see.

157
00:26:32,766 --> 00:26:34,507
You're saying that

158
00:26:34,566 --> 00:26:39,311
the Shaver Mystery
was fictional when it was written.

159
00:26:39,366 --> 00:26:42,176
Now it's recognized as the truth

160
00:26:42,233 --> 00:26:44,611
as well as the hollow earth theory.

161
00:26:44,666 --> 00:26:47,010
You're a quick learner.

162
00:26:48,133 --> 00:26:49,737
Wait a minute.

163
00:26:50,733 --> 00:26:53,680
I understand nothing yet.

164
00:26:55,233 --> 00:26:57,076
I want to know

165
00:26:57,133 --> 00:27:00,307
what was so terrifying
when you died.

166
00:27:00,366 --> 00:27:03,370
The horror I saw on your face...

167
00:27:04,266 --> 00:27:06,678
I came here wanting to find that out.

168
00:27:07,833 --> 00:27:11,645
So you're saying that I'm dead.

169
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,404
I lost my life

170
00:27:16,466 --> 00:27:18,139
before I reached Agartha.

171
00:27:20,266 --> 00:27:23,907
If I really died in front of you,

172
00:27:23,966 --> 00:27:25,968
you shouldn't be with me like this.

173
00:27:26,033 --> 00:27:27,034
Wait...

174
00:27:28,066 --> 00:27:30,774
<i>It doesn't matter
if I have lost my mind.</i>

175
00:27:30,833 --> 00:27:33,177
<i>But I want to stay sane enough
to recognize the terror.</i>

176
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,446
<i>The Mountains Of Madness.</i>

177
00:28:21,899 --> 00:28:25,813
<i>There must be ancient ruins
down in the ravines.</i>

178
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:15,581
<i>This is not the creation of man</i>

179
00:29:15,633 --> 00:29:17,840
<i>but of the under dwellers.</i>

180
00:29:24,566 --> 00:29:27,945
<i>I know I'm not
the only living being here.</i>

181
00:29:29,633 --> 00:29:32,876
<i>I can feel it.</i>

182
00:31:50,733 --> 00:31:54,271
Sorry to have kept you waiting.
I'm Mori.

183
00:31:54,333 --> 00:31:56,335
Isn't it hot in here?

184
00:31:59,666 --> 00:32:04,547
So, Mr. Masuoka,
are you a trained news cameraman?

185
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:09,140
Not just that, but my last company
was affiliated with the news.

186
00:32:09,199 --> 00:32:12,703
We do industrial videos, too.

187
00:32:12,766 --> 00:32:15,645
Sometimes even TV dramas.
Anything goes.

188
00:32:17,666 --> 00:32:21,773
We can register you as camera crew.

189
00:32:21,833 --> 00:32:25,474
When we have a production,
we'll put you down for it.

190
00:32:26,833 --> 00:32:28,506
- That's fine.
- Deal, then.

191
00:32:35,999 --> 00:32:37,444
Here's the one.

192
00:32:37,499 --> 00:32:41,641
The main feature
is the "movie mode,"

193
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,805
a video telecast function.

194
00:32:43,866 --> 00:32:46,938
Do you have a pet, by any chance?

195
00:32:46,999 --> 00:32:51,607
You can check how your cat's doing
from wherever you are.

196
00:32:51,666 --> 00:32:54,078
Great image quality.

197
00:32:54,133 --> 00:32:57,273
We only have one left.

198
00:32:58,566 --> 00:33:01,706
Would you like to buy it?
Thank you very much.

199
00:37:00,566 --> 00:37:04,912
<i>I decided to tentatively call her "F."</i>

200
00:37:06,066 --> 00:37:10,708
<i>Not that I actually call her
by that name.</i>

201
00:37:12,233 --> 00:37:15,043
<i>My little Kaspar Hauser.</i>

202
00:37:18,666 --> 00:37:21,169
<i>I don't know how old she is</i>

203
00:37:21,233 --> 00:37:23,770
<i>but obviously</i>

204
00:37:23,833 --> 00:37:26,905
<i>this is the first time
for her to meet a human.</i>

205
00:37:34,466 --> 00:37:38,414
<i>I wipe her once a day</i>

206
00:37:38,466 --> 00:37:41,242
<i>and that's all I can do for her.</i>

207
00:37:42,666 --> 00:37:47,206
<i>F doesn't eat
nor drink anything.</i>

208
00:37:48,733 --> 00:37:53,739
<i>She's only awake
for three hours or so.</i>

209
00:37:59,433 --> 00:38:03,074
This is Atsuko Ono in Shinjuku.

210
00:38:03,133 --> 00:38:06,114
I'll show you the latest fashion trends,

211
00:38:06,166 --> 00:38:08,646
so check them out.

212
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,976
Let's see what I can find...

213
00:38:11,033 --> 00:38:13,980
Any young couples?
Let's have a look.

214
00:38:14,033 --> 00:38:15,808
Over there!

215
00:38:15,866 --> 00:38:18,972
Excuse me.
Want to be on TV?

216
00:38:19,033 --> 00:38:22,810
Stop the camera!
They don't look like they're in love.

217
00:38:22,866 --> 00:38:25,710
Lose this thing!

218
00:38:25,766 --> 00:38:27,439
Sorry.

219
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,002
We're moving.

220
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,905
The next location...

221
00:38:35,966 --> 00:38:37,240
It's right over there.

222
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:40,281
A new boutique in the mall.

223
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,708
Not again!

224
00:38:41,833 --> 00:38:44,143
Just a little interview.

225
00:39:28,466 --> 00:39:31,606
MA-SU-O-KA

226
00:39:31,733 --> 00:39:34,577
TA-KU-YO-SHI

227
00:39:58,266 --> 00:40:03,215
<i>Maybe her vocal cords are impaired
from being inactive.</i>

228
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:09,115
<i>She came from a world
where vocalizing was unnecessary.</i>

229
00:40:14,666 --> 00:40:16,236
How old is your daughter?

230
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:20,372
No, she's not my daughter...

231
00:40:20,433 --> 00:40:23,471
Is this a gift then?
How tall is she'?

232
00:40:26,566 --> 00:40:29,240
150? Maybe 160 cm...

233
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,973
In that case...

234
00:40:33,233 --> 00:40:35,713
How about this?
This is so pretty.

235
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:37,939
It's popular now.

236
00:40:37,999 --> 00:40:40,240
This one will look great on her.

237
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:43,338
I think I want something plain.

238
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:47,405
Plain?

239
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,181
<i>Who's F talking to?</i>

240
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,742
What's wrong?
What happened?

241
00:43:06,799 --> 00:43:07,800
Hey?

242
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,473
What's wrong?

243
00:43:12,733 --> 00:43:15,475
You should have drunk
what I gave you!

244
00:45:45,666 --> 00:45:47,009
<i>12 seconds.</i>

245
00:45:48,333 --> 00:45:50,040
<i>What happened</i>

246
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:52,512
<i>in those 12 seconds?</i>

247
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:30,101
Hello.

248
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,302
Who is this?

249
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,776
<i>Who I am is irrelevant</i>

250
00:46:42,899 --> 00:46:45,106
<i>to the problem that you have.</i>

251
00:46:53,566 --> 00:46:57,173
<i>You have the wrong number.
I'm not--</i>

252
00:46:57,233 --> 00:47:00,510
<i>I have the right number,
Mr. Masuoka.</i>

253
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:07,707
<i>You're in serious trouble.</i>

254
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:10,907
<i>Do you realize that?</i>

255
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,973
What are you talking about?

256
00:47:17,933 --> 00:47:21,904
<i>There's someone there
who shouldn't be.</i>

257
00:47:23,633 --> 00:47:26,512
<i>She can't survive there.</i>

258
00:47:26,566 --> 00:47:28,170
<i>Do you understand me?</i>

259
00:47:29,933 --> 00:47:33,642
<i>You think that you're saving her life,</i>

260
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:39,651
<i>but you're actually
killing her.</i>

261
00:47:42,533 --> 00:47:44,274
What can I do?

262
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:48,943
She eats nothing, drinks nothing!

263
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,537
Tell me what I'm supposed to do!

264
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,746
FROM PUBLIC PAY PHONE

265
00:48:11,166 --> 00:48:13,737
<i>Should I just</i>

266
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:17,304
<i>observe F as she weakens?</i>

267
00:48:41,233 --> 00:48:44,009
<i>What do I expect from her?</i>

268
00:48:44,933 --> 00:48:46,776
<i>Even if she could be taught</i>

269
00:48:46,833 --> 00:48:49,439
<i>to behave like a human,</i>

270
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:51,980
<i>what would she gain from that?</i>

271
00:48:53,833 --> 00:48:55,608
What are you recording?

272
00:48:55,666 --> 00:48:57,145
Nothing.

273
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:00,613
You were recording me.
I saw you.

274
00:49:00,666 --> 00:49:02,304
It was turned off.

275
00:49:02,366 --> 00:49:05,779
I don't like it.
Give me the tape.

276
00:49:05,833 --> 00:49:10,179
What's the matter?
Did you do something wrong?

277
00:49:10,233 --> 00:49:13,237
Okay, wise-ass. Give it up!

278
00:49:13,299 --> 00:49:15,802
Hand it over.
Give it to me!

279
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:29,576
Hello. I'm back.

280
00:51:32,133 --> 00:51:34,443
Were you sleeping all day again?

281
00:51:56,066 --> 00:51:59,377
It's nothing.
I slipped.

282
00:54:11,633 --> 00:54:13,306
<i>I liked it.</i>

283
00:54:14,299 --> 00:54:16,973
<i>I wanted to keep feeding her</i>

284
00:54:17,033 --> 00:54:19,877
<i>until she's totally satisfied.</i>

285
00:54:23,466 --> 00:54:27,539
<i>Of course
what it means is my own death.</i>

286
00:54:30,766 --> 00:54:32,905
<i>I don't care if I died but...</i>

287
00:54:35,666 --> 00:54:41,480
<i>what would happen to her if I died?</i>

288
00:54:47,666 --> 00:54:52,376
<i>She didn't complain much
about animal blood,</i>

289
00:54:53,433 --> 00:54:57,643
<i>but nothing made her content
like human blood.</i>

290
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:33,346
<i>I gave up
treating her like a human.</i>

291
00:55:34,633 --> 00:55:38,979
<i>I treat her like an animal,
like a pet.</i>

292
00:55:39,033 --> 00:55:41,445
<i>That's all she should be for me.</i>

293
00:55:42,733 --> 00:55:45,441
<i>That's all I should care for her.</i>

294
00:55:57,633 --> 00:56:02,673
<i>Recently she has begun
to behave like a human.</i>

295
00:56:02,733 --> 00:56:04,110
<i>That's probably</i>

296
00:56:04,166 --> 00:56:09,343
<i>just her imitating me.</i>

297
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:14,676
<i>What is... F anyway?</i>

298
00:56:18,166 --> 00:56:21,909
<i>Why does she only feed on blood?</i>

299
00:56:24,566 --> 00:56:28,446
<i>My speculation is that,
from the day of her birth...</i>

300
00:56:29,433 --> 00:56:34,075
<i>she was raised on blood
instead of breast milk.</i>

301
00:56:35,233 --> 00:56:38,476
<i>No human would have done it.</i>

302
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:47,249
<i>It must be someone from underground.</i>

303
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:51,180
<i>Perhaps I can assume that</i>

304
00:56:51,233 --> 00:56:53,679
<i>the Deros brought her up.</i>

305
00:57:02,666 --> 00:57:04,043
Hey...

306
00:57:06,466 --> 00:57:08,343
Did you hurt yourself?

307
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:10,740
Who are you?

308
00:57:12,366 --> 00:57:15,677
What's wrong with you?
Listen to me.

309
00:57:15,733 --> 00:57:17,406
Who are you?

310
00:57:17,466 --> 00:57:19,571
Are you joking?

311
00:57:20,733 --> 00:57:22,974
Fuyumi is missing.

312
00:57:23,033 --> 00:57:25,570
I told the police already.

313
00:57:25,633 --> 00:57:28,170
- But I...
- Fuyumi?

314
00:57:28,233 --> 00:57:30,736
Is she with you now?

315
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:32,802
I don't know any Fuyumi.
I'm innocent.

316
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:36,507
Don't know her?
She's your daughter.

317
00:57:36,566 --> 00:57:38,512
I don't have a daughter!

318
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:49,972
<i>Madness is contagious.</i>

319
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:54,375
<i>Recently I attract madness.
I wonder why...</i>

320
00:59:09,299 --> 00:59:13,338
<i>If she left my apartment of her own will,
she's not so far away.</i>

321
00:59:14,466 --> 00:59:17,743
<i>She can hardly walk.</i>

322
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:19,302
<i>But--</i>

323
00:59:19,366 --> 00:59:22,347
<i>But if somebody took her away...</i>

324
01:00:05,033 --> 01:00:08,879
I'm not giving up, F.

325
01:00:10,433 --> 01:00:11,969
I found her.

326
01:00:14,833 --> 01:00:17,575
I want her back.

327
01:00:25,466 --> 01:00:26,945
Please tell me,

328
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:31,710
has she gone back
to the subterranean ruins?

329
01:00:32,966 --> 01:00:37,142
So you failed, didn't you?

330
01:00:45,266 --> 01:00:48,110
I had a little hope

331
01:00:48,166 --> 01:00:52,080
that you might be the one
who could tame her.

332
01:02:13,533 --> 01:02:18,039
What did she eat
when she was away?

333
01:02:18,100 --> 01:02:20,205
I don't have any idea.

334
01:02:21,166 --> 01:02:24,579
But one thing is clear.

335
01:02:24,633 --> 01:02:28,775
She needs nutritious food desperately.

336
01:03:35,366 --> 01:03:37,471
Don't walk away!

337
01:03:38,700 --> 01:03:41,112
You have to listen to me.

338
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:46,279
You owe me an explanation.

339
01:03:49,066 --> 01:03:51,672
Are you going to ignore me forever?

340
01:03:52,966 --> 01:03:55,708
I'm going to make you talk today.

341
01:03:59,033 --> 01:04:02,674
Stop pretending that you know nothing!

342
01:04:02,733 --> 01:04:04,041
Hey!

343
01:04:05,033 --> 01:04:07,070
Stop treating me like shit!

344
01:04:08,333 --> 01:04:09,869
Stop!

345
01:04:12,166 --> 01:04:14,669
I know you can hear me!

346
01:04:16,333 --> 01:04:18,939
I know Fuyumi's with you.

347
01:04:20,433 --> 01:04:22,413
I want to see her.

348
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:27,280
I know you're hiding her.
So stop pretending!

349
01:04:28,633 --> 01:04:30,635
Say something.

350
01:04:33,366 --> 01:04:35,937
I have a right to see my girl.

351
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:51,215
Do you always take
that video camera with you?

352
01:06:51,266 --> 01:06:53,268
You're a pervert, right?

353
01:06:54,966 --> 01:06:57,503
You have to make me look pretty.

354
01:06:57,566 --> 01:07:00,479
Never tell the school about this.

355
01:07:00,533 --> 01:07:03,241
I'm dead meat if they found out.

356
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:06,372
Are you going to sell this?

357
01:07:06,433 --> 01:07:10,074
- Give me 50,000, then.
- 50,000 yen is enough?

358
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:13,908
I should have made it 100,000.

359
01:07:15,766 --> 01:07:19,475
What are you drinking?
Are you hungry?

360
01:07:19,533 --> 01:07:21,513
It's low-cal diet food.

361
01:07:23,333 --> 01:07:27,281
I have a hungry girl
back at home, too.

362
01:07:30,233 --> 01:07:34,181
So? Are we going to have
the interview here?

363
01:07:34,233 --> 01:07:36,179
I lost my virginity...

364
01:07:37,633 --> 01:07:39,977
When was that?

365
01:07:40,033 --> 01:07:43,913
Was it yesterday
or was it the day before that?

366
01:07:50,133 --> 01:07:52,409
Over there?

367
01:07:52,466 --> 01:07:55,913
Are you serious?
I don't think so.

368
01:07:55,966 --> 01:07:59,379
There are better places than this.

369
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:09,179
What are you?

370
01:08:11,566 --> 01:08:13,375
Throat fetish?

371
01:08:27,033 --> 01:08:29,912
<i>Anybody in fear is beautiful.</i>

372
01:08:30,900 --> 01:08:34,871
<i>But if it's fear of death,</i>

373
01:08:34,933 --> 01:08:36,708
<i>it's mediocre.</i>

374
01:08:55,933 --> 01:08:59,540
<i>I don't recognize myself any more.</i>

375
01:09:18,733 --> 01:09:20,440
CALL FROM PUBLIC PAY PHONE

376
01:09:50,433 --> 01:09:51,673
Hello?

377
01:09:57,900 --> 01:10:00,380
F is content now.

378
01:10:02,366 --> 01:10:04,539
Because I made her content.

379
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:11,507
You should have nothing
to complain about now.

380
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:17,312
<i>No complaints.
You're right.</i>

381
01:10:30,133 --> 01:10:33,410
Roll camera, Masuoka.

382
01:10:33,466 --> 01:10:35,241
- Are you ready, Tanaka?
- Yes.

383
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:37,871
Action in five seconds, four, three, two...

384
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:41,073
Reporting from the murder site.

385
01:10:41,133 --> 01:10:44,137
A high school girl was found dead

386
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:47,613
at a public toilet not long ago.

387
01:10:47,666 --> 01:10:50,704
No sign of theft,

388
01:10:50,766 --> 01:10:53,645
her personal belongings
were found intact.

389
01:10:53,700 --> 01:10:58,513
The police has been examining
the site for further evidence.

390
01:10:58,566 --> 01:11:02,241
The victim has not been
identified yet.

391
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:06,043
We'll give you updates
as information comes through.

392
01:11:07,367 --> 01:11:09,574
Good, out! Okay.

393
01:11:16,466 --> 01:11:18,878
Masuoka, we're done here.

394
01:11:20,233 --> 01:11:21,473
Masuoka!

395
01:11:57,833 --> 01:12:01,280
<i>I think humans are a degenerated species.</i>

396
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:08,248
<i>I believe that our ancestors
were more perceptive than us.</i>

397
01:12:08,300 --> 01:12:13,807
<i>They could see creatures
from a different dimension...</i>

398
01:12:14,733 --> 01:12:19,148
<i>sneaking into our dimension.</i>

399
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:23,546
<i>The creatures...
The strangers...</i>

400
01:13:35,633 --> 01:13:38,045
Come on, let's go.

401
01:14:37,766 --> 01:14:39,803
That's enough.

402
01:14:39,866 --> 01:14:41,539
You've had enough.

403
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:55,173
I took a train
without deciding on a destination.

404
01:16:25,166 --> 01:16:29,205
<i>I don't remember
how long I've been here.</i>

405
01:16:34,266 --> 01:16:38,373
<i>I might as well find a job
in the village...</i>

406
01:16:39,366 --> 01:16:41,778
<i>and work until the day I die.</i>

407
01:16:42,766 --> 01:16:46,441
<i>Maybe that's how my life should be.</i>

408
01:16:49,366 --> 01:16:51,972
Do you want to come home?

409
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:04,770
Home?

410
01:17:09,466 --> 01:17:14,415
We have come from the depths
of the ocean.

411
01:17:16,100 --> 01:17:18,205
Have you forgotten that?

412
01:17:19,733 --> 01:17:21,838
No, I haven't.

413
01:17:25,266 --> 01:17:28,770
Crawling under
tremendous water pressure...

414
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:35,074
our people used to be
so much wiser then.

415
01:17:43,900 --> 01:17:46,904
What did you see?

416
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:53,777
When you poked your eye out
in the subway tunnel...

417
01:17:55,933 --> 01:17:58,311
you looked as if you'd seen

418
01:17:58,366 --> 01:18:00,937
something most terrifying.

419
01:18:05,833 --> 01:18:07,506
Yes.

420
01:18:07,566 --> 01:18:08,874
That's right.

421
01:18:09,866 --> 01:18:14,713
I don't know why,
but I long for your terror.

422
01:18:14,766 --> 01:18:18,737
I long to experience
the terror that you'd felt.

423
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:24,174
That's because it's something unknown.

424
01:18:26,233 --> 01:18:28,474
The feeling we know as terror

425
01:18:28,533 --> 01:18:32,481
is actually ancient wisdom

426
01:18:32,533 --> 01:18:35,446
that's sealed in our subconscious mind.

427
01:19:16,533 --> 01:19:20,538
<i>So I wasn't really mad.</i>

428
01:19:28,166 --> 01:19:30,874
<i>It was just a pretense.</i>

429
01:19:30,933 --> 01:19:33,140
<i>I longed to be mad.</i>

430
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:36,147
<i>I just hoped to be so mad</i>

431
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:39,670
<i>that I could someday
witness the terror.</i>

432
01:19:44,433 --> 01:19:48,210
<i>As a result, I killed my wife...</i>

433
01:19:49,266 --> 01:19:52,110
<i>and treated my daughter
like an animal.</i>

434
01:19:53,366 --> 01:19:56,176
<i>I even killed somebody unrelated.</i>

435
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:01,810
<i>All of that was not enough</i>

436
01:20:01,866 --> 01:20:05,643
<i>to drive me truly insane.</i>

437
01:20:08,967 --> 01:20:13,143
<i>That's how degenerated I am.</i>

438
01:20:42,467 --> 01:20:43,468
<i>A Dero?</i>

439
01:22:12,633 --> 01:22:17,013
<i>The creature still exists
in my apartment.</i>

440
01:24:25,733 --> 01:24:29,579
<i>Looks like she's hibernating...</i>

441
01:25:01,267 --> 01:25:03,338
You...

442
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:09,339
came back to me.

443
01:28:05,933 --> 01:28:09,642
<i>From now on I'll never speak...</i>

444
01:28:10,933 --> 01:28:13,743
