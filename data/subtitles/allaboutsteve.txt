I'll be there in about 10 minutes.

34
00:02:08,329 --> 00:02:10,229
Excuse me.

35
00:02:10,331 --> 00:02:12,060
<i>- Sorry.
- I know, girl.</i>

36
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:15,829
Right? The party was amazing
at Jasmine's last night.

37
00:02:15,937 --> 00:02:18,428
Girl, everybody was there.

38
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:22,066
<i>If you want to seal the deal with a guy,
you need a short skirt and sexy panties.</i>

39
00:02:22,176 --> 00:02:24,644
- Oh. Hold on.
- Uh, is Soloman here?

40
00:02:24,746 --> 00:02:26,373
Oh, he's in the back, baby.

41
00:02:26,481 --> 00:02:28,449
<i>Anyway-
Yeah, you wanna go out with us tonight?</i>

42
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:32,383
<i>Mexicans traditionally have
supplied the world with tacos-</i>

43
00:02:32,487 --> 00:02:34,148
Horowitz!

44
00:02:34,255 --> 00:02:37,691
- Eight down?
- Oh. Uh, uh, that would be Bora-Bora.

45
00:02:37,792 --> 00:02:40,090
It's a tough one. Don't punish yourself.

46
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,193
Please say yes. Please say yes.

47
00:02:48,302 --> 00:02:49,826
<i>- Please say yes.
- Oh, hey, Mary.</i>

48
00:02:49,937 --> 00:02:51,905
Hello, sir.

49
00:02:52,006 --> 00:02:54,167
Um, I have an idea.

50
00:02:54,275 --> 00:02:56,209
Do you have next week's crossword?

51
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,676
Indeed I do, but better yet...

52
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:01,442
I have many and a brilliant plan.

53
00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:04,109
Instead of doing just one crossword
per week, I could go daily.

54
00:03:04,218 --> 00:03:06,152
- I could do five per week-
- I'm sorry...

55
00:03:06,254 --> 00:03:08,688
but we just don't
have space for that kind of content.

56
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:11,088
I know, but, sir, the crossword...

57
00:03:11,192 --> 00:03:14,161
is everyone's favorite
part of the newspaper.

58
00:03:14,262 --> 00:03:16,230
<i>And we could be just like the
New York Times...</i>

59
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,457
where the puzzle gets
harder as the week goes.

60
00:03:18,566 --> 00:03:20,864
So on Monday,
a day that traditionally bites the big one-

61
00:03:20,968 --> 00:03:23,198
<i>This isn't the New York Times.
We're a local paper.</i>

62
00:03:23,304 --> 00:03:25,795
- Our readers just wanna have fun.
- Oh.

63
00:03:25,907 --> 00:03:29,434
Oh! Well, sir, if fun is what they want...

64
00:03:29,544 --> 00:03:31,705
then Mary Horowitz has their fun.

65
00:03:31,813 --> 00:03:33,747
Ta-da! For Saint Patty's Day.

66
00:03:33,848 --> 00:03:35,713
Top o' the morning to ya.

67
00:03:35,817 --> 00:03:36,178
Leprechaun.

68
00:03:36,179 --> 00:03:38,377
<i> Wonderful.
You guys are such a beautiful couple.</i>

69
00:03:41,022 --> 00:03:42,922
Congratulations, man.

70
00:03:43,024 --> 00:03:44,924
<i>I know. Who would have ever thought?</i>

71
00:03:45,026 --> 00:03:46,755
- Mary.
- Yes?

72
00:03:46,861 --> 00:03:49,762
Do you ever stop working
long enough to, you know, like, go out?

73
00:03:49,864 --> 00:03:51,764
- Mm-mmm.
- Uh, spend time with friends?

74
00:03:51,866 --> 00:03:54,164
- Nope.
- Go on a date?

75
00:03:54,268 --> 00:03:57,795
Mm-mmm. Oh. Uh, well,
I have a- a date this evening, sir.

76
00:03:57,905 --> 00:04:00,237
- Oh?
- Yes. A-A blind one.

77
00:04:00,341 --> 00:04:03,970
My parents set it up. So I was
obviously going to cancel.

78
00:04:04,078 --> 00:04:05,602
Go on out on your date.

79
00:04:05,713 --> 00:04:08,079
You know, have some fun with him, and-

80
00:04:08,182 --> 00:04:10,150
Have you moved back into your apartment?

81
00:04:10,251 --> 00:04:13,152
Uh, no. Still fumigating.

82
00:04:13,254 --> 00:04:15,222
But I'm just waiting for
the chemicals to settle...

83
00:04:15,323 --> 00:04:17,791
so I don't get the- the old brain cancer.

84
00:04:17,892 --> 00:04:21,191
Though if I don't move out of my parents'
home soon, I'll be forced to get a lobotomy.

85
00:04:21,295 --> 00:04:23,127
So it's brain cancer,
lobotomy, brain cancer-

86
00:04:23,128 --> 00:04:23,286
Mary.

87
00:04:23,397 --> 00:04:27,424
Mary, less work, more of everything else.

88
00:04:27,535 --> 00:04:29,435
Just enjoy being normal.

89
00:04:30,872 --> 00:04:33,898
Martin, I need that feature
on the pumpkin shortage.

90
00:04:34,008 --> 00:04:35,976
Is it ready?

91
00:04:39,413 --> 00:04:42,712
Be normal.

92
00:04:42,817 --> 00:04:44,546
Normal.

93
00:04:44,652 --> 00:04:48,247
<i># Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey #</i>

94
00:04:48,356 --> 00:04:50,415
<i>In life, as in crosswords...</i>

95
00:04:50,525 --> 00:04:52,459
<i>some days are harder than others...</i>

96
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,653
<i>and that's what keeps your brain alive.</i>

97
00:04:54,762 --> 00:04:57,230
<i>The key to surviving those tough days
is to pick yourself up...</i>

98
00:04:57,331 --> 00:04:59,993
<i>and stay focused on your life's purpose.</i>

99
00:05:00,101 --> 00:05:04,868
<i>For me, that's imparting the joy
of crosswording to all mankind.</i>

100
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:07,031
<i>Ah, crosswording...</i>

101
00:05:07,141 --> 00:05:10,668
<i>the most spectacular fun
a person can have without passing out.</i>

102
00:05:10,778 --> 00:05:12,905
I like your protective ensemble.

103
00:05:13,014 --> 00:05:15,141
Bunker gear, if you will.

104
00:05:15,249 --> 00:05:18,741
So, if these kids set you on fire,
you're good to what- 300 degrees?

105
00:05:18,853 --> 00:05:20,753
If I survive this- Phew!

106
00:05:20,855 --> 00:05:23,323
I'm supposed to go on a blind date tonight.

107
00:05:23,424 --> 00:05:25,324
Yeah. Steve.

108
00:05:25,426 --> 00:05:29,226
Steve. Yeah.
His mother probably thinks he's gay.

109
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:33,323
So, my parents are no doubt pimping me out
to test his sexuality. Thanks.

110
00:05:33,434 --> 00:05:36,232
<i>But I'm- I'm- I'm gonna cancel.</i>

111
00:05:36,337 --> 00:05:38,931
Yeah. I mean, wouldn't you?

112
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,873
Yeah? Though I-I could use a little-

113
00:05:41,976 --> 00:05:43,876
if you know what I'm saying.

114
00:05:43,978 --> 00:05:46,845
Yeah. Been a long time.

115
00:05:49,584 --> 00:05:51,779
Mary Horowitz.

116
00:05:51,886 --> 00:05:54,616
Yes. Yes. That is-That's me.

117
00:05:54,722 --> 00:05:57,282
Here's a treat, students.

118
00:05:57,391 --> 00:06:02,124
<i>Miss Mary Horowitz is the crossword
constructor for the Sacramento Herald.</i>

119
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:05,290
You know the crossword puzzles that you see
each week in the newspaper?

120
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:08,095
Well, it's her job to create them.

121
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:10,261
Isn't that fun?

122
00:06:11,372 --> 00:06:14,205
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

123
00:06:14,308 --> 00:06:18,301
people do crossword puzzles all the time...

124
00:06:18,412 --> 00:06:23,543
but they don't often think of the person
who made all the words fit together.

125
00:06:23,651 --> 00:06:28,714
<i>Crossword constructors have
above-average intelligence...</i>

126
00:06:28,823 --> 00:06:30,882
and it helps if they can spell.

127
00:06:36,764 --> 00:06:38,755
Okay. Um-

128
00:06:38,866 --> 00:06:40,493
Okay. That's good.

129
00:06:43,371 --> 00:06:45,896
Imagine, if you will, a world.

130
00:06:46,007 --> 00:06:48,737
- A world-
- Daniel. You have a question.

131
00:06:48,843 --> 00:06:51,004
You make a living doing that?

132
00:06:51,112 --> 00:06:53,012
Well-

133
00:06:53,114 --> 00:06:55,275
One puzzle a week
can't make you enough to live on.

134
00:06:55,383 --> 00:06:57,783
<i>How do you pay your rent?</i>

135
00:06:57,885 --> 00:06:59,876
Oh, uh-

136
00:06:59,987 --> 00:07:04,924
Well, my parents have graciously
permitted me to bunk at their abode...

137
00:07:05,026 --> 00:07:07,927
<i>- while my apartment is being fumigated.
- You live with your parents?</i>

138
00:07:08,029 --> 00:07:10,691
<i>Temporarily, yes, I live at home.</i>

139
00:07:12,233 --> 00:07:15,828
But, then again, so do all of you.
So there. Now-

140
00:07:15,937 --> 00:07:18,497
- You don't have a husband, do you?
- Or a boyfriend.

141
00:07:18,606 --> 00:07:20,870
Kids, come on.

142
00:07:23,411 --> 00:07:25,811
No. Not-Not at- Not at this time.

143
00:07:28,716 --> 00:07:30,650
Though I have had liaisons.

144
00:07:46,067 --> 00:07:50,128
<i># Soon Yi was a pilot in the nationally known #</i>

She didn't have no time #</i>

147

149
00:08:04,385 --> 00:08:06,285

150
00:08:06,387 --> 00:08:08,719
<i>- # She went to UCLA#
- No, no, no, no, no.</i>

151
00:08:16,097 --> 00:08:19,624
Hi. I often suffer from
benign positional vertigo.

152
00:08:19,734 --> 00:08:22,430
Do you mind not driving until I can get my-

153
00:08:22,536 --> 00:08:24,834
Okay. Okay. All right.

154
00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:27,339
Ow.

155
00:08:27,441 --> 00:08:31,241

159
00:08:49,296 --> 00:08:52,094
Mary? How'd it go?

160
00:08:53,501 --> 00:08:55,401
Smashing success.

161
00:08:55,503 --> 00:08:59,269
<i>Or as they say in old Paris,
coup de maître, meaning "masterstroke."</i>

162
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:01,759
<i>Okay, I'm gonna go upstairs
and, uh, get ready.</i>

163
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:01,933
Good.

164
00:09:02,043 --> 00:09:04,204
Oh. So you're going ahead with the date?

165
00:09:10,151 --> 00:09:12,415
Yes. Of course.

166
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:15,284
Look how excited I am. Better get going...

167
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:18,552
if I'm gonna fall in love
and get proposed to...

168
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:21,560
register at Barnes and "Normal"...

169
00:09:21,662 --> 00:09:24,153
<i>have a beautiful wedding

170
00:09:24,265 --> 00:09:27,530
plastic bride and groom on top of a cake,
posing like this.

171
00:09:29,904 --> 00:09:32,270
I'm gonna go.

172
00:09:32,373 --> 00:09:34,705
<i>I just want her to be happy.</i>

173
00:09:34,809 --> 00:09:36,106
Yeah.

174
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:38,371
Go out and have some fun.

175
00:09:38,479 --> 00:09:40,640
Mm-hmm.
You ever wanna see any grandchildren...

176
00:09:40,748 --> 00:09:42,943
you're gonna have to burn those damn boots.

177
00:09:44,085 --> 00:09:47,646
Carol, I have a date.

178
00:09:47,755 --> 00:09:50,952
A blind one.

179
00:09:51,058 --> 00:09:52,958
But...

180
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:57,861
if this Steven is anything better than
excessively hideous...

181
00:09:57,965 --> 00:10:00,490
I think we really should
try and make it work.

182
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:03,627
Because, if society wants me to be normal...

183
00:10:03,737 --> 00:10:06,604
then normal we shall be, right?

184
00:10:06,707 --> 00:10:08,675
Yes.

185
00:10:08,776 --> 00:10:12,234
Oh, and, Carol, I really would appreciate
your support on this too.

186
00:10:12,346 --> 00:10:14,940
And by "support," I don't mean that.

187
00:10:16,584 --> 00:10:18,518
<i>Mary?</i>

188
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:20,587
Knock, knock, knock.

189
00:10:21,655 --> 00:10:24,021
Oh. Look at you.

190
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:27,026
Already have- repeatedly.

191
00:10:27,128 --> 00:10:29,062
Mar. He's hot.

192
00:10:29,163 --> 00:10:32,394
Please don't mean on the inside.

193
00:10:34,668 --> 00:10:36,761
<i>- I'm a cameraman for CCN-
- Mm-hmm?</i>

194
00:10:36,871 --> 00:10:38,862
<i>- a news program.
- We don't really watch-</i>

195
00:10:38,973 --> 00:10:40,337
<i>Work with a guy
called Hartman Hughes.</i>

196
00:10:40,338 --> 00:10:41,908
<i>Ever seen him?
No. Can't say I have, but -</i>

197
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:03,990
Hey, Mary. I'm Steve.

198
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:34,250
Carol. Carol, I bring news.

199
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:37,888
There's been a- There's been
a most unexpected turn of events.

200
00:11:37,998 --> 00:11:42,833
My date is substantially better
looking than one might have predicted.

201
00:11:42,937 --> 00:11:46,600
And you know what? Colin Powell once said,
"There's no secret to success."

202
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:48,607
Well...

203
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:52,611
clearly he doesn't understand the power
of spectacular skivvies.

204
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:55,113
There she is!

205
00:12:00,254 --> 00:12:02,313
Oh, wow.

206
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,255
Nice boots.

207
00:12:08,362 --> 00:12:10,227
Thank you.

208
00:12:10,331 --> 00:12:12,162
You ready?

209
00:12:12,266 --> 00:12:14,257
Mmm.

210
00:12:14,368 --> 00:12:16,268
<i>- So nice to meet you.
- Yeah.</i>

211
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:19,635
- Oh, yeah. It's raining outside.
- Hold this. The door.

212
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,731
<i>- Let me get that door for you.
- Thanks again.</i>

213
00:12:21,842 --> 00:12:24,572
<i>- Good luck. Shalom.</i>

214
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:31,116
I have to admit, at first I wasn't so sure
about this whole blind date thing...

215
00:12:31,218 --> 00:12:33,880
but now I'm surprised
our parents didn't set it up earlier...

216
00:12:33,988 --> 00:12:35,888
especially knowing my mother.

217
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:38,083
Must be some kind of conspiracy.

218
00:12:41,695 --> 00:12:43,629
Oop. You good?

219
00:12:47,101 --> 00:12:49,069
Oh, he's so not gay.

220
00:12:53,407 --> 00:12:55,637
Oh, man, it's coming down.

221
00:12:59,246 --> 00:13:01,942
It's really coming down, huh?

222
00:13:02,049 --> 00:13:05,815
I thought maybe we could
go to, uh, Ernesto's.

223
00:13:07,254 --> 00:13:09,984
They've got great tamales.

224
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:13,287
And they have this drink
called, uh, "El Gallo Negro."

225
00:13:13,394 --> 00:13:14,861
<i>It means "the black rooster."</i>

226
00:13:14,962 --> 00:13:17,362
You have, like, two of those drinks, it's like you-

227
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:19,762
Oh. You okay? You okay?

228
00:13:24,405 --> 00:13:27,374
Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.

229
00:13:28,976 --> 00:13:31,410
Wait, wait.
What-What about-What about your parents?

230
00:13:31,512 --> 00:13:33,412
- What about my parents?
- Your mom.

231
00:13:33,514 --> 00:13:36,210
Mmm. She's married,
and you're not her type. Mmm.

232
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:40,548
No, I just mean-
I just mean we're right in front of home.

233
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:42,588
Whoa. I just-

234
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:45,284
I just mean we're right
in front of their house.

235
00:13:47,428 --> 00:13:49,692
And I have no problem with that whatsoever.

236
00:13:49,797 --> 00:13:53,324
Oh, Steven. Oh, Steven.

237
00:13:54,358 --> 00:13:58,201
Is that Steven with a "V"
or Stephen with a "P-H"?

238
00:13:58,305 --> 00:14:00,398
- It's with a "V."
- I thought so.

239
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:02,771
- Yeah.
- Thought so. You know, There's over...

240
00:14:02,876 --> 00:14:04,901
a million Stevens with a-
a "V" in the country.

241
00:14:05,012 --> 00:14:07,845
It's much more popular than the "P-H" way.
Twice as popular, in fact.

242
00:14:07,948 --> 00:14:09,882
I think it was the Brits
who prefer their P-H's.

243
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:12,834
Yeah. Not as much as their fish and chips.

244
00:14:14,722 --> 00:14:17,350
Steven, we really should
commend our mothers...

245
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:19,479
for predicting our
all-encompassing compatibility.

246
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:19,756
I got it.

247
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,624
I mean, we're-we're both
professionally compatible...

248
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:25,893
you in TV,
and- and me in, uh-you know, in newspapers.

249
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:30,197
I'll help you. Also noticing we're both
quite sexually compatible.

250
00:14:30,304 --> 00:14:33,603
I don't know if you noticed like I noticed,
but we're both wearing blue...

251
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:35,607
- and what are the chances of that?
- Ooh.

252
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:37,176
- Okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

253
00:14:37,277 --> 00:14:39,370
Of course, the chances are probably pretty good-

254
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,040
<i>given that blue is one of the most
popular of the three colors.</i>

255
00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:44,743
Do you, uh- Do you like crosswords?

256
00:14:44,852 --> 00:14:46,410
Sure I do.

257
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,044
- Really?
- Yeah.

258
00:14:48,155 --> 00:14:50,419
You know how when the perfect clue
gets stuck in your brain...

259
00:14:50,524 --> 00:14:55,120
and it just explodes
into this bouquet of mixed emotions?

260
00:14:55,229 --> 00:14:57,561
I'm- I'm aroused.
I'm intrigued. I'm a- I'm amused.

261
00:14:57,664 --> 00:15:00,997
- I'm perplexed. I'm- I'm just like all these things.
- Uh-huh.

262
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:05,595
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Can- Let's go back to the, uh- the aroused.

263
00:15:05,706 --> 00:15:07,503
- Okay. Okay. Wow. Steven.
- Whoa.

264
00:15:07,608 --> 00:15:10,406
- Oh.
- It's like we're two rare Earth elements...

265
00:15:10,511 --> 00:15:12,445
just brought together by the Norns.

266
00:15:12,546 --> 00:15:17,176
- It's just-That's Scandinavian for the Destinies.
- Oh.

267
00:15:17,284 --> 00:15:20,193
And now I'm going to eat you
like a mountain lion.

268
00:15:21,555 --> 00:15:23,648
You know what? I'm sorry.

269
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:25,315
- It's my phone.
- What are you doing?

270
00:15:25,426 --> 00:15:27,394
- I didn't hear it ring. That's odd.
- Vibrate. It vibrated.

271
00:15:27,494 --> 00:15:29,655
- I didn't feel it.
- Oh, probably because of all the grinding.

272
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:31,754
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

273
00:15:31,865 --> 00:15:34,356
- I'll get over here.
- Yeah?

274
00:15:34,468 --> 00:15:36,663
What? Yeah. What's up?

275
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:39,295
- All right. I'm coming.
- Oh! Already?

276
00:15:39,406 --> 00:15:42,136
- Okay. Okay. I can hurry. I can hurry.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

277
00:15:42,242 --> 00:15:43,869
I- I gotta go to work.

278
00:15:43,977 --> 00:15:47,105
<i>- There's breaking news.
- Oh. Oh!</i>

279
00:15:47,214 --> 00:15:50,047
<i>- Gosh, I'm so sorry.
- Well, it's-it's okay. It's-</i>

280
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:53,984
I gotta go to, uh, Boston.

281
00:15:54,087 --> 00:15:56,317
Wow. Boston, huh?

282
00:15:56,423 --> 00:15:58,618
That's a spectacular city.

283
00:15:58,725 --> 00:16:00,852
Known not only for its- its tea...

284
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:03,725
but, uh, for Sam Morse,
who invented the Morse code.

285
00:16:03,831 --> 00:16:05,799
<i>- Get out of here.
- Yes. Do you want some help?</i>

286
00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:09,198
No. You know, it's so- it'd be so much more
interesting staying here and everything.

287
00:16:09,303 --> 00:16:12,670
Like, I really wish you could be there.

288
00:16:12,773 --> 00:16:15,207
<i>- Life on the road sure is tough.
- Oh. I- I-</i>

289
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:17,504
But you have a job to do.

290
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:24,644
Oh. He likes Twinkies.

291
00:16:26,119 --> 00:16:29,179
Okay. It's been fun.

292
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:36,061
<i>- Okay. That's for you.
- Oh. Gracias.</i>

293
00:16:36,163 --> 00:16:38,688
Yeah.

294
00:16:43,237 --> 00:16:45,171
Thank God.

295
00:16:48,275 --> 00:16:50,675
Okay. Big crazy person.

296
00:16:54,915 --> 00:16:58,112

00:17:08,395 --> 00:17:10,295
<i>that means crossword constructor-</i>

301
00:17:10,397 --> 00:17:13,230
<i>I would find comfort in the words
of the learned crossword sages.</i>

302
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,358
<i>My hero was Manny Nosowsky...</i>

303
00:17:15,469 --> 00:17:19,303
<i>frequent New York Times contributor
and all-around cruciverbal master.</i>

304
00:17:19,406 --> 00:17:22,671
<i>Manny says that
a crossword puzzle's greatness...</i>

305
00:17:22,776 --> 00:17:26,075
<i>can be determined
by asking three simple questions:</i>

306
00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:28,647
<i>- Is it solvable?
- Bonsoir!</i>

307
00:17:28,749 --> 00:17:32,344
<i># You got me stuck to you
You got me stuck to you #</i>

308

00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,492
<i> Yes. Okay. So, lunch meeting
at that Japanese restaurant at 1:30, okay?</i>

314
00:17:49,603 --> 00:17:53,266
And I need to- I-This crossword is bullshit.

315
00:17:53,373 --> 00:17:56,536
Anyway, he said he was gonna change,
and I, for one, believe him, so-

316
00:17:56,643 --> 00:17:58,577
This doesn't make any sense.

317
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:01,944
- Well, to me, it does.
- Oh. Yeah. Of course.

318
00:18:02,049 --> 00:18:04,540
- This is lame.
- Have you tried six down?

319
00:18:04,651 --> 00:18:08,314
<i>- These clues suck!</i>

320
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:13,085
I can't get any of these!

321
00:18:14,194 --> 00:18:16,162
Oh, thanks.

322
00:18:16,263 --> 00:18:20,495
Don't even bother. I don't know what the deal
is, but it looks like every single clue is-

323
00:18:20,601 --> 00:18:22,592
"All About Steve"?

324
00:18:24,371 --> 00:18:27,772
One across: Steve's eye color.
Five across: Steve's car odor.

325
00:18:27,874 --> 00:18:31,332
Twenty across: Steve's lips taste like-

326
00:18:31,445 --> 00:18:33,675
Mint explosion.

327
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:36,506
Mary, who's Steve?

328
00:18:36,617 --> 00:18:40,678
- Oh. An extraordinary-
- No, no. That's not what's important.

329
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:44,188
What's important is what you've done
with this crossword puzzle. I mean, it's- it's-

330
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:47,158
- It's inspired.
- No.

331
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,989
- Romantic.
- No.

332
00:18:49,096 --> 00:18:52,998
Oh, you're a tough one today. Let's see. Um-

333
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,000
It's unprofessional.

334
00:18:55,102 --> 00:18:57,696
Un- No.
That's not the word.

335
00:18:57,804 --> 00:19:01,171
Um, okay. Let me think. You are-

336
00:19:02,743 --> 00:19:04,711
Mmm.

337
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:06,745
You've tarnished the paper's reputation.

338
00:19:06,847 --> 00:19:10,908
<i>I mean, I really thought that you would've known
better than to pull something like this.</i>

339
00:19:11,018 --> 00:19:14,818
Do you have any idea
how many readers you've let down?

340
00:19:14,921 --> 00:19:18,584
Uh, 7,402, but-

341
00:19:18,692 --> 00:19:20,717
- Mary.
- Yes?

342
00:19:24,598 --> 00:19:26,566
Mary, we're gonna have to let you go.

343
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:32,600
Oh.

344
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:35,538
<i>I could make it up to you...</i>

345
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:38,269
by doing a fishing themed crossword.

346
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:41,005
I know how you love the- the piscatology.

347
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:49,517
I'm sorry.

348
00:19:52,158 --> 00:19:54,058
We can, um-

349
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,060
Yeah, we'll just, uh-We'll-

350
00:19:56,162 --> 00:19:58,062
I'll call you, and we'll just-

351
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:07,601
<i>Police tell us that the chief suspect in
the case is one Mr. Mark McLaglen.</i>

352
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:09,902
Okay, guys. You're set.

353
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:13,103
Tucson's affiliate's on site now.
Remote van's waiting for you at the airport.

354
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,271
- Okay.
- But I get an Escalade, right?

355
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:20,050
Dan, we talked about this.
Nick Vasquez gets an Escalade.

356
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:23,952
- Nick Vasquez has six Emmys.
- Stolen from me.

357
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:27,787
<i>- He was robbed, Dan. All six times.
- Thank you, Stevie.</i>

358
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,691
I mean, he can't help it
if he's considerably older than Vasquez.

359
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:35,096
By "older" he means
experienced, Marlboro Man handsome.

360
00:20:35,201 --> 00:20:37,260
Um, I'm pretty sure I meant old.

361
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:41,601
<i>Wh-Wh-Wh-Whatever.
Which one of you geniuses can explain this?</i>

362
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:44,073
...little feller just needs to stiffen up.

363
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:47,077
<i>With the two purple flowers-</i>

364
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:50,171
- I'd, uh, be happy to, Dan.
- Look at how the blue brings out my eyes.

365
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:53,615
Yeah. What I was going for here was-
Oh, look at that smooth push-in.

366
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:56,279
<i>Western motif,
sort of the iconic flower.</i>

367
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:59,687
<i>Then I needed a backdrop,
like a mountainous range. Boom! Two mountains.</i>

368
00:20:59,792 --> 00:21:01,919
In Hollywood, they call that a Mae West,
'cause Mae West had-

369
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:05,622
Keep talking, fellas. Keep talking your way
right back to the Weather Channel.

370
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:08,165
Right back to 10 degrees in Buffalo...

371
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:11,430
where you'll be spending most of your days
taking close-up shots of kids' snotsicles.

372
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,403
Well, give us something good, Danny.

373
00:21:15,508 --> 00:21:18,568
- I mean- we're fighter pilots, man.
- Yeah, we really are.

374
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:21,612
It's like sending an F-16
to kill your neighbor's dog.

375
00:21:21,714 --> 00:21:23,614
<i>It's a waste of our energy.</i>

376
00:21:23,716 --> 00:21:26,947
And I need one big report, man,
to get that anchor desk.

377
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:29,043
Get out of my office.

378
00:21:29,155 --> 00:21:33,148
<i>This is a big report, so don't screw it up with
any more stupid pranks this time, Hartman.</i>

379
00:21:33,259 --> 00:21:35,659
And you, Angus,
you're responsible for these guys.

380
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:38,423
Make sure they don't embarrass me in Tucson.
They screw around, you're out.

381
00:21:38,531 --> 00:21:39,028
Yes, sir.

382
00:21:39,029 --> 00:21:41,625
Remember the Escalade.

383
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,868
- Starling, how you doing?
- Whatever.

384
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,835
- Jackie, looking sweet. Paula.
- In your dreams.

385
00:21:46,939 --> 00:21:50,670
I can feel your love darts coming over this way.

386
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:52,801
- Mom. I'm working. What's up?
- You're the man, Hartman Hughes.

387
00:21:52,912 --> 00:21:54,812
No, I haven't read it. Why?

388
00:21:54,914 --> 00:21:58,850
<i>Uh, okay. Hey.
Does anybody have a Sacramento Herald?</i>

389
00:21:58,951 --> 00:22:00,851
<i>- Yeah. Right here.
- Right. Yeah, I got it.</i>

390
00:22:00,953 --> 00:22:02,944
Yes, I ate lunch. What section?

391
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:08,084
Oh, wow. This is all about me.

392
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:14,090
Wait. This is all about me.

393
00:22:42,795 --> 00:22:44,695
Yes.

394
00:22:45,731 --> 00:22:48,996
Oh. Ow, ow, ow.

395
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:52,264
Doesn't hurt, doesn't hurt, doesn't hurt.

396
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:55,101
But obviously the gods have seen-

397
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,505
Where are you?

398
00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:00,636
Ooh. Hi. There you are.
Okay. Do you know what's at work here?

399
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:04,011
<i>Pistas. Indicios. Anhaltspunkte.</i>

400
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:06,209
Clues.
They're just-They're-They're everywhere.

401
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:09,151
One, I was thinking of not going on the date,
but then the good children...

402
00:23:09,255 --> 00:23:12,418
of, uh, Youngstrum Academy kindly-
You know, they-they persuaded me to go.

403
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:14,992
Two, my date duly arrives.

404
00:23:15,094 --> 00:23:18,791
<i>And lo, not only is he, uh, muy caliente,
but he likes my red boots.</i>

405
00:23:19,999 --> 00:23:22,559
<i>Three, Steve says it would be great...</i>

406
00:23:22,668 --> 00:23:24,602
if I could be on the road with him.

407
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:27,570
<i>But, of course,
I cannot because I have a job.</i>

408
00:23:27,673 --> 00:23:30,767
Four, only days later,
I learn I no longer have a job...

409
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:35,836
which is obviously just the final clue
leading to the blindingly simple answer:

410
00:23:35,948 --> 00:23:38,678
Onward, Mary Horowitz.
Onward. Go be with Steve.

411
00:23:38,784 --> 00:23:41,446
What do you mean you don't have a job?

412
00:23:41,553 --> 00:23:44,818
Missing the point, Father. Uh, the clues
have been deciphered. I must journey forth.

413
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:47,825
Journey forth where?

414
00:23:49,228 --> 00:23:51,287
Father, you're making me crazy.

415
00:23:54,033 --> 00:23:56,399
Ah. Voilà, Papa.

416
00:23:56,502 --> 00:23:59,699
If it is news, Steven is there.
Auf Wiedersehen.

417
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:03,434
This is Hartman Hughes
reporting from the edge.

418
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:05,567
Anybody seen Vasquez? Huh?

419
00:24:05,678 --> 00:24:07,578
- Anybody seen Vasquez?
- No.

420
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,171
Too much of a pussy to come
to a dangerous hostage crisis.

421
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,049
Thirty seconds.

422
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:12,682
Just gonna bring
you around on the left.

423
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:16,380
Well, I wanna open up on the dust,
then we're gonna hit a 45 up to your right side.

424
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:20,185
All right. Steve, but I'm gonna indicate down
the street. I'm gonna come around the left.

425
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:22,317
- And right here.
- Ten seconds-you're on with Paula.

426
00:24:22,428 --> 00:24:25,556
She still mad at you for giving
those Jenny Craig gift certificates?

427
00:24:25,664 --> 00:24:26,346
And five, four-

428
00:24:26,347 --> 00:24:29,031
Fact I was looking at her ass
to begin with is a compliment.

429
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:35,603
Paula, I've just arrived
at Wild Willy's Old Western Town...

430
00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:38,370
beloved tourist attraction
in Tucson, Arizona.

431
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:42,413
On a typical day,
this street would be busy...

432
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:46,848
with families eager to enjoy
the Wild West life experience.

433
00:24:46,952 --> 00:24:50,581
Tragically, today,
the man who plays Wild Willy the Outlaw...

434
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:53,214
has taken his role to heart...

435
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:55,725
and captured eight of his coworkers,
taking them hostage...

436
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:58,058
<i>and holding them in the saloon...</i>

437
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:02,065
a mere 85 yards away from where I stand now.

438
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,158
Shots have been fired, Paula!

439
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:07,261
<i>- Let's go handheld, Steve!</i>

440
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:14,108
<i>It's unclear at this moment
who the shot was intended for...</i>

441
00:25:14,213 --> 00:25:17,705
or how many lives have perhaps been lost.

442
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:20,307
Okay. Breaking news, Paula.

443
00:25:20,419 --> 00:25:23,183
We have our first confirmed kill:

444
00:25:23,288 --> 00:25:25,256
a horse.

445
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:30,693
<i>One of many that live here
at Wild Willy's Old Western Town.</i>

446
00:25:30,796 --> 00:25:33,629
First victim of this senseless tragedy.

447
00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:40,634
It's at moments like this I'd like to believe
that there's a heaven just for horses-

448
00:25:41,673 --> 00:25:43,573
rolling meadows, lush grasses...

449
00:25:43,675 --> 00:25:48,112
<i>the spirits of deceased horses
galloping to and fro.</i>

450
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:51,273
Long may you roam...

451
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:55,884
<i>- in heaven, O noble horse.
- </i>

452
00:25:57,423 --> 00:25:59,391
<i>Not dead.</i>

453
00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:07,120
And yet, the horse not quite dead, Paula.

454
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,097
<i>Not quite dead at all.</i>

455
00:26:11,637 --> 00:26:15,164
He's apparently a trained horse, Paula.

456
00:26:15,274 --> 00:26:17,435
Trained to drop down-

457
00:26:17,543 --> 00:26:21,809
during Wild Willy's
Old West shoot-out routine.

458
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:23,882
<i>This particular horse...</i>

459
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:27,611
also sensitive to trucks
backfiring on Route 20.

460
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:29,744
Well-

461
00:26:29,855 --> 00:26:33,791
in the midst of tragedy, a blessed miracle.

462
00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:34,081
Cut.

463
00:26:34,082 --> 00:26:37,191
<i>Damn it, Steve!
Do you think this is funny?</i>

464
00:26:37,296 --> 00:26:41,756
You guys could see the horse is alive, and you're
giving me the "bring 'em the tears" signal?

465
00:26:41,867 --> 00:26:43,767
No, no.
This is the "bring the tears" signal.

466
00:26:43,869 --> 00:26:45,860
This is
"Hey, the horse is up. It's galloping."

467
00:26:47,973 --> 00:26:49,440
Yeah.

468
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,508
<i>You know my favorite answer?</i>

469
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,578
<i>"Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis."</i>

470
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,045
<i>It's a lung disease.
Ooh! Fontana, California.</i>

471
00:26:56,148 --> 00:26:58,514
Y-You know what they make there? No?

472
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:00,517
No? They make-They make steel.

473
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:03,452
Yeah. Do you know how they make it? No?

474
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:06,683
I won't bore you with the whole story,
just the-just the best parts...

475
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:10,523
like- like how it's made from, uh,
molten pig iron, which-

476
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:14,861
which does not, as everyone might think,
have anything to do with pigs or swines or hogs.

477
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:18,630
It's-It's a raw iron
made from iron and coke.

478
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:21,831
<i>And by coke, I mean the, uh, carbonaceous
residue, not the-not the cola.</i>

479
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,840
Or the booger sugar.

480
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:27,343
<i>It's-It's a method perfected
by Sir Henry Bessemer, a Brit.</i>

481
00:27:27,446 --> 00:27:31,678
Oh. And Bessemer is also a town in Alabama.
Yea!

482
00:27:31,783 --> 00:27:34,183
<i>Yep. And you know what
they have there? No? No?</i>

483
00:27:34,286 --> 00:27:38,313
Hitler's typewriter.
Hitler's typewriter.

484
00:27:38,423 --> 00:27:40,721
That guy was such an asshole.

485
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:43,602
<i>Anyone up for a potty break?
It's not good to hold it.</i>

486
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,661
We're gonna take five minutes here.

487
00:27:49,268 --> 00:27:54,228
Establishments in desolate areas like this
are usually run by family members that are, uh-

488
00:27:56,875 --> 00:28:00,276
No! No! Stop!

489
00:28:02,281 --> 00:28:04,249
<i>Whoo-hoo!</i>

490
00:28:05,551 --> 00:28:08,179
Crap. Crap.

491
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:24,525
<i># I want to hit the road #</i>

492
00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:28,163
Yes. Hi. Uh, Do you know when
the next bus to Tucson goes through here?

493
00:28:28,273 --> 00:28:30,798
'Cause I kind of just-just missed mine.

494
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:37,546
I'm headed that way.

495
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:39,549
Oh. That's nice.

496
00:28:42,354 --> 00:28:44,288
<i>So, you ever kill any animals?</i>

497
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:48,086
<i>Set a trash can full of kittens on fire?
You know, something like that.</i>

498
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:49,785
No.

499
00:28:49,895 --> 00:28:52,363
No? Okay.

500
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:54,398
What about humans? That had to-

501
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:57,760
Would I tell you if I did?

502
00:28:59,972 --> 00:29:02,566
Touché, sir. Touché.

503
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:05,837
<i># Hit the road and drive for miles #</i>

504
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:10,807
<i># I'm gonna hit the road
and I'm not gonna-#</i>

505
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:13,214
<i>You can wait for that
next bus if you want.</i>

506
00:29:25,297 --> 00:29:27,265
Uh- Uh-

507
00:29:27,366 --> 00:29:32,497
Roughly 9.85.
I will give this to you and just-Thank you.

508
00:29:33,739 --> 00:29:35,673
Stop! Stop!

509
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:53,584
May I see your license, please?

510
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:03,366
Norman James Durwood?

511
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:06,369
Mary Magdalene Horowitz. Nice to meet you.

512
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:08,996
Good to meet you, I think.

513
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:13,237
<i>Norm, if you are going
to rape and murder me...</i>

514
00:30:13,345 --> 00:30:16,178
you are going to have to cut my body up
into a million chunks...

515
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:18,181
and scatter me all over four states...

516
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:20,046
because this appendage...

517
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:23,485
will lead homicide detectives right to you.

518
00:30:23,588 --> 00:30:26,216
<i>And that would be no bueno.
I think we're good.</i>

519
00:30:30,062 --> 00:30:33,691
My other rules about
crossword is this: no pencils.

520
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:37,428
Doing a crossword with a pencil is like
screaming with your lips duct-taped together.

521
00:30:37,536 --> 00:30:40,334
<i>It is weak.
If you're going to do a crossword puzzle...</i>

522
00:30:40,439 --> 00:30:43,772
you need to do it fearlessly
and with abandon and with a pen.

523
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:46,036
I prefer medium felt-tip blue.

524
00:30:46,144 --> 00:30:49,602
It's about choosing your path, Norm,
and just committing to it.

525
00:30:50,949 --> 00:30:53,543
<i>Well, I figure that
when you miss a bus...</i>

526
00:30:53,652 --> 00:30:55,677
maybe you weren't meant to take it.

527
00:30:57,923 --> 00:31:01,120
Hmm.

528
00:31:01,226 --> 00:31:04,093
<i>Are you familiar with, uh-
with, uh, moon blindness, Norm?</i>

529
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:06,562
<i>- It's like this awful eye pus that starts to ooze-
- You know...</i>

530
00:31:06,665 --> 00:31:09,395
quiet time might be real
good right about now.

531
00:31:10,435 --> 00:31:13,097
Oh. Okay.

532
00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:16,774
<i>Quiet. Silencio.</i>

533
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,843
<i>Ruhe.</i>

534
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:23,138
Hey, Norm.

535
00:31:23,248 --> 00:31:24,476
Mary?

536
00:31:24,583 --> 00:31:27,245
Thanks for not raping me.

537
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:31,485
My pleasure.

538
00:31:34,493 --> 00:31:39,362
<i> Howdy, partners!
Welcome to Wild Willy's Ol' Western Town!</i>

539
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:42,900
<i>Howdy, partners! Welcome to
Wild Willy's Ol' Western Town!</i>

540
00:31:45,537 --> 00:31:49,132
All righty. Give my love to the kids.

541
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:52,301
Good luck. And if that Steve
shows you any disrespect-

542
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:54,311
Disrespect. Well, if you mean unmannerly...

543
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:56,472
tactless and vulgar,
he is a straight man, Norman.

544
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:59,072
Some things can't be helped.
But if you mean that he's someone-

545
00:31:59,184 --> 00:32:00,776
See ya, Mary.

546
00:32:02,354 --> 00:32:05,755
See ya, Norm.

547
00:32:16,635 --> 00:32:20,594
<i>- # I want to be a cowboy's sweetheart #</i>

557
00:32:52,838 --> 00:32:56,968
<i>They're all safe.
The man surrendered. </i>

558
00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:01,102
<i> Crap.</i>

559
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,845
<i>- Adiós.
- Adiós, señora.</i>

560
00:33:13,692 --> 00:33:15,091
<i>What did they say?</i>

561
00:33:15,193 --> 00:33:16,524
<i>- Baby Peggy...
- ¿Sí?</i>

562
00:33:16,628 --> 00:33:17,754
<i>- in Oklahoma...
- ¿Sí?</i>

563
00:33:18,196 --> 00:33:19,390
<i>Poor little thing.</i>

564
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:23,025
<i>Oh. Oh. Gracias. Gracias, señor.</i>

565
00:33:23,134 --> 00:33:24,658
<i>- De nada.
- ¡Hasta luego!</i>

566
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:25,997
<i>Vaya con Dios.</i>

567
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:28,867
...Guadalupe Aguero, or to us, Baby Peggy...

568
00:33:28,974 --> 00:33:33,206
was born with an extremely rare
birth defect: a third leg.

569
00:33:33,311 --> 00:33:36,246
Shortly after the birth,
her poor immigrant parents separated.

570
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:40,546
Now with joint custody, one parent wants
the abnormal baby to keep the third leg.

571
00:33:40,652 --> 00:33:43,280
- The other wants it gone.
- After months of legal wrangling...

572
00:33:43,388 --> 00:33:45,288
the judge has ordered
in favor of the mother.

573
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:47,358
Amputation surgery is
scheduled for tomorrow...

574
00:33:47,459 --> 00:33:49,518
but the father, Mr. Aguero,
isn't about to give up.

575
00:33:49,628 --> 00:33:53,724
As his lawyers work to
secure an injunction...

576
00:33:53,832 --> 00:33:57,768
the father continues to rally support
around the rogue leg.

577
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:01,828
I'm quoting. " If God didn't want
my daughter to have a third leg...

578
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:04,932
he wouldn't have stuck one
between the other two."

579
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:08,171
So, for now, the fate
of the precious child's third leg...

580
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:11,306
is in the hands of a judge.

581
00:34:11,416 --> 00:34:14,544
Hartman Hughes,
reporting from Oklahoma City...

582
00:34:14,653 --> 00:34:18,612
near the leg,
and as always, from the edge.

583
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:21,783
- Cut.
- Okay. What do you think?

584
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:24,293
In the next segment,
I was thinking about saying...

585
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:27,763
"Baby Peggy is in
a three-legged race against time."

586
00:34:27,866 --> 00:34:30,835
- What do you think?
- Okay.

587
00:34:30,936 --> 00:34:32,961
- Wanna do some one-on-ones?
- Do it.

588
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:36,905
Okay. Just intelligent
arguments from both sides.

589
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:38,908
Intelligent arguments, guys!

590
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:43,572
I was born with a vestigial penis.
That means a penis hanging outside the body.

591
00:34:43,682 --> 00:34:47,049
You know, like yours. I'm talking about
a ding-a-ling. Know what I'm saying?

592
00:34:47,152 --> 00:34:51,384
And it was pretty good size. I was kind of
proud of it. I got to be in seventh grade.

593
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:55,186
I used to work it, hang it on the side
in gym class. I got all the attention.

594
00:34:55,293 --> 00:34:59,559
<i>Now there's just a big old scar.
Can you feel it? Can you feel that scar?</i>

595
00:34:59,664 --> 00:35:02,895
Right? Okay. So, they cut it off, then-

596
00:35:03,001 --> 00:35:05,435
What? What happened? H- I wasn't finished.

597
00:35:05,537 --> 00:35:09,200
- That was unbelievable.
- Yeah, that was the, uh, highlight of my morning.

598
00:35:11,309 --> 00:35:12,776
- Vasquez.
- Where?

599
00:35:12,877 --> 00:35:15,675
<i>Oh. That's a new Escalade.</i>

600
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,271
<i>He's got three security guards.</i>

601
00:35:18,383 --> 00:35:20,851
Look at that. He brought toys.

602
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:27,015
Ooh, that's that guy from the news.
Hey. You with the baby. Hey.

603
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:31,619
Son of a bitch.
He's got a three-legged doll baby. Angus!

604
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:24,342
What?

605
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:27,917
Oh, no.

606
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:31,011
<i>#Love him, I love him, I love him #</i>

607
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:34,751
<i># And where he goes
I'll follow, I'll follow, I'll follow #</i>

608
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:38,386
<i># I will follow him #</i>

609
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:41,897
<i># Follow him wherever he may go #</i>

610
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,365
- Hi!
- Oh!

611
00:36:43,468 --> 00:36:46,596
- Hey.
- Hi. Hi.

612
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:48,138
Hey. Oh.

613
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:50,867
- How are ya? Hey!
- I'm good. Surprise!

614
00:36:50,975 --> 00:36:53,102
Yeah, I didn't- I-Yeah.

615
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:56,146
- Look at you, here.
- Sorry it took me so long.

616
00:36:56,247 --> 00:36:58,715
- It did. It did.
- Yeah.

617
00:36:59,202 --> 00:37:01,047
Oh, I brought your-
I brought your umbrella back.

618
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:03,746
- And I got a surprise-
- Oh. I have a lot, but that's fine.

619
00:37:03,855 --> 00:37:06,415
that I know you love.

620
00:37:06,524 --> 00:37:10,221
Oh. Wow. That's, uh-

621
00:37:10,328 --> 00:37:12,888
That's-Wow. That's scary thoughtful.

622
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:15,727
- Thanks. Thank you.
- I-I-I know you love them. Twinkies.

623
00:37:15,834 --> 00:37:19,228
So, you-you-you came here
all the way just to see me?

624
00:37:19,229 --> 00:37:19,668
Yes, sir.

625
00:37:19,771 --> 00:37:22,137
"Ask and you shall receive."
You know who said that?

626
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,868
- No.
- Jesus.

627
00:37:24,976 --> 00:37:28,309
Did Jesus tell you to come here?

628
00:37:28,413 --> 00:37:32,315
Jesus ask me to come here.

629
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:34,612
- No. You did.
- Oh. No. No.

630
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:36,346
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't.

631
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:38,149
- Yes, you did.
- I don't think so.

632
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:40,383
Yes. Right after you fondled my breasts.
Remember?

633
00:37:40,492 --> 00:37:42,722
- Who?
- You. Remember?

634
00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:45,022
- Oh.
- " Oh, life on the road sure is awful.

635
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:47,826
Sure would be great if you could
be out there with me."

636
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,832
Oh, yeah.

637
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:52,164
With your big old hands.
Just grabbed my little puppies and-

638
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,795
- Yeah.
- went to town.

639
00:37:54,906 --> 00:37:57,170
- It felt good.
- Good.

640
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,300
- Yeah.
- Uh, well, that's great.

641
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:02,937
Yeah. It will be great,
because you are making journalistic history-

642
00:38:03,047 --> 00:38:06,073
- Oh. That's sweet of you to say.
- and I will be right by your side...

643
00:38:06,184 --> 00:38:08,482
for- for support and encouragement...

644
00:38:08,586 --> 00:38:10,486
and whatever, like...

645
00:38:10,588 --> 00:38:13,816
nurturing and-and coddling
you as a man should require.

646
00:38:13,817 --> 00:38:13,989
Okay.

647
00:38:14,092 --> 00:38:16,322
I'm-I'm pretty much a one-man team.
It's just-

648
00:38:16,427 --> 00:38:19,453
It's- It's just me and, uh, my camera.
God, yeah.

649
00:38:19,564 --> 00:38:21,464
- You know what? And yes.
- Can't believe it.

650
00:38:21,566 --> 00:38:24,000
You know, the news- the news needs you.
Look.

651
00:38:24,102 --> 00:38:26,161
Because I-I bet my left ovary...

652
00:38:26,271 --> 00:38:29,832
that that- that's Baby Peggy's daddy
leaving the hospital to avoid the press.

653
00:38:29,941 --> 00:38:32,466
- Right there. Look.
- Oh, no, that's a nurse.

654
00:38:32,577 --> 00:38:33,043
No. Right-

655
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:35,512
No, they're all dressed like-
There's a lot of nurses.

656
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:37,084
'Cause we're at a hospital.

657
00:38:37,085 --> 00:38:40,243
But a- But a nurse not wearing
sterilized nonslip footwear?

658
00:38:40,351 --> 00:38:43,684
<i>- What?
- Look.</i>

659
00:38:43,788 --> 00:38:46,154
Oh! Ho-Holy shit! You're right.

660
00:38:46,257 --> 00:38:49,522
- Yeah. I- I should, uh-Thank you.
- Go, Steven with a "V."

661
00:38:49,627 --> 00:38:52,323
First priority, your-your occupation.

662
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:54,330
Second priority, fornication!

663
00:38:56,434 --> 00:38:58,459
Fornication.

664
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:00,470
- Excuse me, ma'am.
- Yes. Ooh. Sorry?

665
00:39:00,572 --> 00:39:02,506
- Only media are allowed up here.
- Oh. Absolutely.

666
00:39:02,607 --> 00:39:04,871
My credentials, kind sir.

667
00:39:05,944 --> 00:39:08,378
<i>- "Cruciverbalist"?
- Sí.</i>

668
00:39:08,479 --> 00:39:11,937
You gotta stay down there with your friends.

669
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:14,382
My friends.

670
00:39:14,485 --> 00:39:17,488
<i>Don't make us beg!
Save the third leg!</i>

671
00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:20,615
<i>Don't make us beg!
Save the third leg!</i>

672
00:39:20,725 --> 00:39:23,853
<i>Don't make us beg!
Save the third leg!</i>

673
00:39:23,962 --> 00:39:27,227
Don't make us beg! Save the third leg!

674
00:39:27,332 --> 00:39:30,733
- Don't make us beg! Save the third leg!
- Again!

675
00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:32,803
<i>Don't make us beg!
Save the third leg!</i>

676
00:39:35,306 --> 00:39:37,900
<i>Okay, guys. That's 30.
That was fantastic.</i>

677
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:42,210
<i>Hi there. I like your boots.</i>

678
00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:44,873
Oh. Thanks.

679
00:39:44,983 --> 00:39:48,043
Are you pro-leg or anti-leg?

680
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:50,143
Neither really.

681
00:39:50,255 --> 00:39:53,156
Well, um, this is the
pro-leg group over here.

682
00:39:53,258 --> 00:39:57,558
Oh, we are supporting Baby Peggy's dad
in the fight to save the baby's third leg.

683
00:39:57,662 --> 00:40:00,722
- Oh, wow.
- Um, over there-Well, those are the anti-leggers.

684
00:40:00,832 --> 00:40:04,495
Well, is the, uh- is the additional leg
functioning or non-functioning?

685
00:40:04,602 --> 00:40:09,437
Because if it has full mobility, it's both
a physical asset and a medical phenomenon.

686
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:12,441
Those are a lot of words.

687
00:40:12,543 --> 00:40:14,841
- And they're kind of big. I don't understand.
- Sorry.

688
00:40:14,946 --> 00:40:18,438
In addition to promoting
a righteous cause...

689
00:40:18,549 --> 00:40:20,642
the pro-leggers have better snacks.

690
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:25,522
Okay. I'm, um...

691
00:40:25,623 --> 00:40:27,523
definitely pro-leg then.

692
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:30,594
Yea!

693
00:40:30,695 --> 00:40:33,425
Come around.
You can help light the rest of the candles.

694
00:40:33,531 --> 00:40:35,897
Okay. Okay.

695
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:40,195
Love those boots.

696
00:40:40,305 --> 00:40:43,035
<i> Angus. Footage of
the dad leaving the scene.</i>

697
00:40:43,141 --> 00:40:45,837
<i>- Nice work.
- Right?</i>

698
00:40:45,944 --> 00:40:48,174
- How'd you get that?
- Uh-

699
00:40:50,148 --> 00:40:53,675
This is Hartman Hughes
reporting from the edge.

700
00:40:58,389 --> 00:41:00,323
You remember the blind date I went on?

701
00:41:00,425 --> 00:41:02,450
- Yeah. The one who did the crossword.
- Yeah.

702
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,460
She followed me here.

703
00:41:04,562 --> 00:41:07,053
- Here?
- Yeah, yeah.

704
00:41:07,165 --> 00:41:11,226
I mean, I saw her at the bridge, and I- I think
she's with the protesters. She has red boots.

705
00:41:11,336 --> 00:41:13,065
- Is she attractive?
- I mean, who cares?

706
00:41:13,171 --> 00:41:16,663
I've been married to the same woman
for nine years. I care.

707
00:41:16,774 --> 00:41:19,800
- I think she thinks that I invited her here.
- Did you?

708
00:41:19,911 --> 00:41:22,539
No. I mean, well-

709
00:41:22,647 --> 00:41:24,547
Kind of. I mean-

710
00:41:24,649 --> 00:41:28,050
But I was just trying to be nice, you know,
to get her out of my truck.

711
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:30,518
You could have tried "Get out of my truck."

712
00:41:30,621 --> 00:41:33,055
I can't be held responsible
for being a nice guy, right?

713
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:36,593
No. Of course not. Unless she's
doing a crossword all about you...

714
00:41:36,694 --> 00:41:39,356
and following you
across the country like a stalker.

715
00:41:39,464 --> 00:41:41,932
Stalker?

716
00:41:42,033 --> 00:41:44,263
- Who has a stalker?
- Steve does. Big-time.

717
00:41:44,369 --> 00:41:46,894
- No, no, no, no. What?
- Big-time.

718
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:49,439
Really? What's going on with that?

719
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:53,840
<i>No, I was telling him about Mary. Remember Mary,
the blind date my parents set me up on?</i>

720
00:41:53,945 --> 00:41:55,879
She was on me like a
mountain lion in the truck.

721
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:58,574
Great in theory, but...
wouldn't stop talking.

722
00:41:58,683 --> 00:42:00,583
She was like a talking encyclopedia.

723
00:42:02,553 --> 00:42:04,544
So, uh, is she here, or-

724
00:42:04,655 --> 00:42:06,520
No. No, no, no. I think she went up-

725
00:42:06,624 --> 00:42:08,922
Red boots, with the protesters. Hot.

726
00:42:09,027 --> 00:42:10,995
Red boots?

727
00:42:11,095 --> 00:42:13,393
- You bang a fireman?
- No.

728
00:42:13,498 --> 00:42:16,262
No, I did not bang a fireman.

729
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:18,528
Hmm.

730
00:42:18,636 --> 00:42:21,969
All right.
I'm gonna go outside...

731
00:42:22,073 --> 00:42:25,236
and get some, uh, snacks.

732
00:42:25,343 --> 00:42:27,743
<i>- You want anything?
- Oh, man. I could use a club soda...</i>

733
00:42:27,845 --> 00:42:30,473
<i>with shaved ice with a twist of lemon.</i>

734
00:42:36,187 --> 00:42:38,849
- Awesome. He's getting me drinks.
- You think that's where he's going?

735
00:42:38,956 --> 00:42:39,152
Yeah!

736
00:42:39,153 --> 00:42:41,390
That's not where he's going.
I don't know what he's up to.

737
00:42:41,492 --> 00:42:43,255
He's always thinking about something.

738
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:46,795
<i>- # Save the leg, my friend #
- This glue is making me high.</i>

739
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:47,914
<i># Save the leg #</i>

740
00:42:47,915 --> 00:42:50,299
It's the, uh-
It's the methylbenzene in there, Winston.

741
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:52,301
<i>- Give me that.
- # Save the leg, my friend ##</i>

742
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:54,667
Here.

743
00:42:54,772 --> 00:42:56,740
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, hi.

744
00:42:56,841 --> 00:42:58,741
- Uh, can I help?
- Oh, sure.

745
00:42:58,843 --> 00:43:02,176
Mary, have you met Howard?
Howard, Mary. Mary, Howard.

746
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:06,341
- How do you do?
- Uh, I'm not quite sure what you mean.

747
00:43:06,451 --> 00:43:08,919
Uh-

748
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:11,614
I'm just gonna sit down.

749
00:43:11,722 --> 00:43:14,190
- So, what can I do?
- Can you, um- Can you do the ribbon?

750
00:43:14,292 --> 00:43:16,988
- Yes.
- Okay. Here's scissors if you need them.

751
00:43:19,063 --> 00:43:21,964
- Mary.
- Oh, hey. That's that news guy.

752
00:43:22,066 --> 00:43:23,693
Hartman Hughes.

753
00:43:23,801 --> 00:43:26,599
So, this is the pro-legger camp.

754
00:43:26,704 --> 00:43:28,672
- Yeah.
- Handsome group.

755
00:43:28,773 --> 00:43:30,673
<i>That's right.</i>

756
00:43:30,775 --> 00:43:33,107
You folks are all for
keeping Baby Peggy abnormal.

757
00:43:33,211 --> 00:43:36,442
- Abnormal?
- Extra legs equals extra awesomeness.

758
00:43:36,547 --> 00:43:38,481
<i>- Yeah.</i>

759
00:43:38,583 --> 00:43:41,609
- She'd just be like the tree frog.
- Come again?

760
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:43,846
A trematode parasite causes polymely-

761
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:46,549
that means "extra limbs"- in-in
tree frogs. Yeah.

762
00:43:46,657 --> 00:43:49,057
Happens all the time.
It's-It's totally normal.

763
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:51,137
<i>In some ponds,
there's a quarter of the tree frogs-</i>

764
00:43:51,138 --> 00:43:51,526
Hartman Hughes!

765
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:53,620
with extra limbs,
and sometimes they found that if-

766
00:43:53,731 --> 00:43:55,631
You know, over at the media tent...

767
00:43:55,733 --> 00:43:58,099
we're gonna take a break in a few minutes...

768
00:43:58,202 --> 00:44:00,966
and, uh, sure enough like you to join me.

769
00:44:01,072 --> 00:44:04,405
Oh.
I can't. Um, I have flute lessons.

770
00:44:07,512 --> 00:44:11,073
Will Steve be there?

771
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:14,841
- Who do you think sent me?
- Oh.

772
00:44:14,952 --> 00:44:17,386
<i>All right, girl. You go, girl.</i>

773
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:20,013
Go on to that media tent with your bad self.

774
00:44:20,124 --> 00:44:22,024
<i>Go get your man, honey.</i>

775
00:44:22,126 --> 00:44:24,060
<i>- I'll be right back.
- Holler if you need backup.</i>

776
00:44:24,162 --> 00:44:27,522
Did Steve tell you all about
the crossword I did for him?

777
00:44:27,523 --> 00:44:27,928
Oh, yeah.

778
00:44:28,032 --> 00:44:30,796
There's no words to describe
how much it meant to him.

779
00:44:30,902 --> 00:44:33,097
Oh, but there are. There are always words.

780
00:44:33,204 --> 00:44:35,104
- You know-
- Yes?

781
00:44:35,206 --> 00:44:38,141
It's easy to see
why he fell for you the way he did.

782
00:44:38,242 --> 00:44:40,210
Oh.

783
00:44:41,445 --> 00:44:43,413
So, he, uh- Oh, yeah.

784
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:46,506
he told you all about
the incredible connection and intensity...

785
00:44:46,617 --> 00:44:48,517
- and je ne sais quoi?
- Oh, yeah.

786
00:44:48,619 --> 00:44:50,587
He told me about the quoi.

787
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:52,952
He wouldn't shut his piehole about the quoi.

788
00:44:53,057 --> 00:44:56,515
But, you know,
his bliss is tempered with fear.

789
00:44:56,627 --> 00:44:58,185
- Oh.
- When you saw him today...

790
00:44:58,296 --> 00:45:01,527
did he seem like a man
whose heart and loins were full of joy?

791
00:45:01,632 --> 00:45:04,100
<i>Um-</i>

792
00:45:04,202 --> 00:45:06,966
I- I-I-I don't know. I don't know if- if-

793
00:45:07,071 --> 00:45:08,971
- Mmm, no.
- No.

794
00:45:09,073 --> 00:45:10,973
- It's because he's afraid, Mary.
- Oh.

795
00:45:11,075 --> 00:45:14,135
He's afraid you're gonna... break his heart.

796
00:45:14,245 --> 00:45:17,146
But I wouldn't do that. I wouldn't do
that to Steve. I could never do that.

797
00:45:17,248 --> 00:45:19,739
- I'm incapable-
- Shh.

798
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:22,512
You rest those pretty
little mouth pillows, huh?

799
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:25,384
You're gonna need 'em later
for all sorts of naughtiness.

800
00:45:25,489 --> 00:45:28,049
What I need to know from you right now...

801
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:32,789
are you gonna stick around long enough
to help us work through Steve's fear?

802
00:45:32,897 --> 00:45:34,797
- Oh. Of course. Of course. Yes.
- Ah.

803
00:45:34,899 --> 00:45:37,959
- If he tells you to go, you don't go.
- Mm-hmm. No? Okay.

804
00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:42,972
Mm-mmm. He starts throwing words around
like "cuckoo" and "loony" and "crazy"...

805
00:45:43,074 --> 00:45:44,974
- that's his fear talking.
- Oh.

806
00:45:45,076 --> 00:45:46,976
- All right?
- Okay. Okay. Yes.

807
00:45:47,078 --> 00:45:50,946
If he tries to run away,
I want you to grab him.

808
00:45:51,048 --> 00:45:51,334
Okay.

809
00:45:51,335 --> 00:45:54,142
And with the strength that
God gives you, hang on.

810
00:45:54,252 --> 00:45:55,742
- Be calm and focused.
- Okay. Okay.

811
00:45:55,853 --> 00:45:57,753
- You wanna know why?
- Why? Yeah. Why?

812
00:45:57,855 --> 00:46:00,187
You're the rock in this relationship.

813
00:46:00,291 --> 00:46:02,191
I'm the rock.

814
00:46:02,293 --> 00:46:05,785
- You're the glue that holds it together.
- I'm the glue. Okay.

815
00:46:05,896 --> 00:46:08,831
Right here. Look at me. Focus.

816
00:46:10,368 --> 00:46:12,802
Are you gonna soldier on...

817
00:46:12,903 --> 00:46:14,803
no matter what happens?

818
00:46:14,905 --> 00:46:17,135
Of course.

819
00:46:17,241 --> 00:46:19,141
- Of course.
- Good.

820
00:46:19,243 --> 00:46:22,701
You know what I see in those big, beautiful eyes?

821
00:46:23,814 --> 00:46:25,714
Plica semilunaris secretions?

822
00:46:25,816 --> 00:46:27,716
Do I have something in my eye?

823
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:31,846
Bravery.

824
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:36,223
Hmm. Well, I'm a little nervous.

825
00:46:36,327 --> 00:46:40,855
- Now you go get your Steve on.
- Okay. Okay.

826
00:46:40,965 --> 00:46:43,627
<i>- You said she was hyper?
- Yeah, she's really hyper.</i>

827
00:46:43,734 --> 00:46:46,066
That's good. That's good.
The calm and focused ones...

828
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:48,536
they keep all that bottled up inside,
and before you know it-

829
00:46:51,075 --> 00:46:54,044
You know? But as long as she's hyper,
you don't have to worry about it.

830
00:46:54,145 --> 00:46:56,340
One thing she isn't is calm.

831
00:46:56,447 --> 00:46:58,711
- Dude.
- Something you wanna tell me?

832
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:00,909
- Dude. Is that her?
- Hmm?

833
00:47:01,018 --> 00:47:02,986
Is that her?

834
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:08,424
Oh.

835
00:47:08,526 --> 00:47:09,493
Want some?

836
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:15,328
Okay.

837
00:47:15,433 --> 00:47:18,334
- How'd she get in here?
- I don't know. She's calm.

838
00:47:20,171 --> 00:47:23,937
Boy, did I miss you, Steven with a "V."

839
00:47:24,041 --> 00:47:27,272
- Let's go for a talk outside.
- Okay. Walkie-talk.

840
00:47:27,378 --> 00:47:29,278
- Right out here.
- Okay.

841
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:31,348
All right.

842
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:35,280
- Oops. Yes?
- Okay.

843
00:47:35,386 --> 00:47:37,411
- You can't stay here.
- Sure I can.

844
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:39,716
- No.
- That's the beauty of my job. I can send in...

845
00:47:39,824 --> 00:47:42,793
- crossword puzzles from anywhere in the world.
- No. Listen. Listen. Okay.

846
00:47:42,893 --> 00:47:45,453
- Listen to me.
- Mm-hmm?

847
00:47:45,563 --> 00:47:47,531
I don't want you here. Okay?

848
00:47:47,631 --> 00:47:49,531
But you said.

849
00:47:49,633 --> 00:47:51,965
I said- I know- I'm a guy. Okay?

850
00:47:52,069 --> 00:47:54,367
We say things we don't mean.

851
00:47:54,472 --> 00:47:57,635
Well, then, how do I know
you mean what you're saying now...

852
00:47:57,742 --> 00:48:00,632
when you said you didn't mean
what you said?

853
00:48:00,633 --> 00:48:01,200
That's crazy.

854
00:48:01,312 --> 00:48:04,042
Well, see, that's your fear talking.

855
00:48:04,148 --> 00:48:06,708
Why are you so calm?

856
00:48:06,817 --> 00:48:10,116
How come you're not more hyper?
That's freaking me out a bit. I gotta be honest.

857
00:48:10,221 --> 00:48:12,485
- Steve, it's all gonna be okay.
- I know it is, if you-

858
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:14,490
Maybe even wonderful.

859
00:48:14,592 --> 00:48:17,117
- Hartman Hughes told me everything.
- What?

860
00:48:17,228 --> 00:48:19,128
- I talked to Hartman Hughes.
- When did you talk to him?

861
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:21,221
- It doesn't matter.
- Did he- Did he come get you?

862
00:48:21,332 --> 00:48:23,232
- Steve.
- Where is he? Hughes.

863
00:48:23,334 --> 00:48:27,430
Steven, Steven, Steven, Steven. Come here.
Look at me. You here? Are you here with me?

864
00:48:27,538 --> 00:48:29,438
- Okay.
- Focus. Right here. Okay? Look at me.

865
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:33,340
"Intimate relationships
cannot substitute for a life plan...

866
00:48:33,444 --> 00:48:36,345
"but to have any meaning
or validity at all...

867
00:48:36,447 --> 00:48:39,780
a life plan must include
intimate relationships."

868
00:48:39,884 --> 00:48:41,579
Do you know who said that?

869
00:48:41,685 --> 00:48:43,118
- Jesus?
- Harriet Lerner.

870
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:45,154
- Oh.
- Psychologist, lecturer and author...

871
00:48:45,256 --> 00:48:49,249
<i>of the timeless classic
Franny B. Kranny, There's a Bird in Your Hair!</i>

872
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:52,193
- I was gonna run for governor, but-
- Hey, Hughes.

873
00:48:52,296 --> 00:48:53,524
<i>- Come here.
- Hey.</i>

874
00:48:53,631 --> 00:48:56,327
- Come here.
- Steve.

875
00:48:56,434 --> 00:48:58,425
- Yes, sir.
- This another one of your pranks? Huh?

876
00:48:58,536 --> 00:49:02,336
I don't know what you're into, lago,
but you better tell her the truth, okay?

877
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:05,932
I'm a newsman. I'm incapable of
saying anything but the truth.

878
00:49:06,043 --> 00:49:11,174
Okay. Well, then tell her you lied and-
and that I really-

879
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:13,182
I don't want you here. I'm sorry.

880
00:49:13,284 --> 00:49:14,876
Okay.

881
00:49:22,259 --> 00:49:24,557
Sorry. Just...

882
00:49:24,662 --> 00:49:27,062
<i>things didn't work out.</i>

883
00:49:27,164 --> 00:49:29,098
You're gonna find a great guy.

884
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,667
Baby.

885
00:49:30,768 --> 00:49:32,895
What is that?

886
00:49:34,004 --> 00:49:36,063
I want you guys to have a baby.

887
00:49:36,173 --> 00:49:37,538
Why?

888
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:39,302
You guys belong together.

889
00:49:40,611 --> 00:49:42,670
- I'm gonna hit you, man.
- Aw, come on.

890
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:45,146
You're not gonna hit the face of CCN-

891
00:49:45,249 --> 00:49:49,686
Stop it! " Victory attained through violence
is tantamount to defeat, for it is momentary."

892
00:49:49,787 --> 00:49:51,914
- This is what I'm talking about.
- Do you know who said it? Gandhi. Gandhi.

893
00:49:52,022 --> 00:49:54,252
- What are you afraid of?
- What am I afraid of?

894
00:49:54,358 --> 00:49:57,293
You don't want her to know about
"I heart Mary" carved in a tree trunk?

895
00:49:57,394 --> 00:49:59,385
Why are you putting stuff
like that in her head?

896
00:49:59,497 --> 00:50:01,397
- You said that?
- No, I never said that.

897
00:50:01,499 --> 00:50:03,865
Maybe you're afraid the great Hartman Hughes
is gonna steal her away.

898
00:50:03,968 --> 00:50:07,369
- You're crazy!
- I'm like Helen of Troy. No fights!

899
00:50:07,471 --> 00:50:10,497
Hey, guys!
Baby Peggy's parents settled.

900
00:50:10,608 --> 00:50:14,100
- Steve, your camera.
- Oh, Jesus, Angus!

901
00:50:14,211 --> 00:50:15,735
- Sorry. Sorry.
- See what happens?

902
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:17,404
You mess with me, you mess with my boy.

903
00:50:17,515 --> 00:50:19,949
- Mary, stay! Mary, stay!
- But you-

904
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:21,915
<i>- Mary!
- Call the station.</i>

905
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:24,912
<i>- Mary!
- We're live in two minutes!</i>

906
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:26,751
Tissue.

907
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:30,452
With mere hours to spare,
the Agueros reconciled...

908
00:50:30,561 --> 00:50:35,089
agreeing to halt surgery until Baby Peggy
is old enough to decide for herself.

909
00:50:35,199 --> 00:50:38,965
It's time for the Agueros
to be a family once again.

910
00:50:39,069 --> 00:50:42,004
So today, like the noble tree frog...

911
00:50:42,106 --> 00:50:44,700
whose third leg is nothing if not natural...

912
00:50:44,808 --> 00:50:48,574
<i>Baby Peggy marches on with
her three-legged life.</i>

913
00:50:48,679 --> 00:50:50,579
Steve! I'm coming. Excuse me.

914
00:50:50,681 --> 00:50:53,081
<i>Medical emergency.
Thank you. Please allow me through.</i>

915
00:50:53,183 --> 00:50:54,946
Possible concussion,
could faint at any time.

916
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:57,748
- Steve, I'm coming.
- No, no. Ma'am, you can't go back there.

917
00:51:03,227 --> 00:51:05,252
<i>Are you all right?</i>

918
00:51:05,362 --> 00:51:07,592
Could someone please help him?

919
00:51:07,698 --> 00:51:11,225
Maybe apply a vasoconstrictor
or a nasal tampon? Please.

920
00:51:11,335 --> 00:51:15,066
She trying to kill me? She's trying to kill me.

921
00:51:15,172 --> 00:51:19,074
This is Hartman Hughes report-

922
00:51:19,176 --> 00:51:21,076
What the hell was that?

923
00:51:21,178 --> 00:51:23,408
It's this girl who Steve invited, sir.

924
00:51:23,514 --> 00:51:27,314
I didn't invite her. She's stalking me.

925
00:51:27,418 --> 00:51:29,978
Never mind.

926
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:32,214
There's a hurricane off the coast of Texas.
Get to it.

927
00:51:32,323 --> 00:51:34,223
I'm sorry. It'll never happen again.

928
00:51:34,325 --> 00:51:37,192
If you three weren't the closest crew to Galveston,
you'd be hitchhiking home by now.

929
00:51:37,294 --> 00:51:39,194
- Yes, sir.
- Get off the phone.

930
00:51:39,296 --> 00:51:41,821
Did you hear that about the tree frog?

931
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:44,594
Every time she speaks, I smell anchor desk.

932
00:51:44,702 --> 00:51:47,535
I get it, Hartman. You're trying
to get back at me, but Mary's not the way.

933
00:51:47,638 --> 00:51:49,663
She's insane. She tried to kill me.

934
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:51,104
Hartman, something's wrong with her.

935
00:51:51,208 --> 00:51:53,403
- You didn't see that?
- You fell down. Boo-hoo.

936
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:55,569
I fell down? My legs were
taken out from under me.

937
00:51:55,679 --> 00:51:57,874
What are you talking about?
She's stalking me.

938
00:51:57,982 --> 00:51:59,813
<i>- Dude, she's not stalking you.
- Steve!</i>

939
00:51:59,917 --> 00:52:03,114
Oh, shit! Tell her I'm not
here. Tell her I'm not here.

940
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:04,517
- Steve. Hi, guys.
- Hello, Mary.

941
00:52:04,622 --> 00:52:07,216
Hi. I'm so sorry I was detained.

942
00:52:07,324 --> 00:52:09,690
<i>I was questioned by authorities about an
apparent crime against one of your coworkers.</i>

943
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:11,556
But all's been resolved. Steve.

944
00:52:11,662 --> 00:52:14,290
Considering you almost cost us our job,
maybe now's not a great time.

945
00:52:14,398 --> 00:52:17,663
I'm so sorry.
I could call your employer and apologize.

946
00:52:17,768 --> 00:52:19,565
I can actually apologize
in 17 different languages.

947
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:22,503
Huh.

948
00:52:22,606 --> 00:52:26,007
So, Mary, we're going to Galveston.
There's a big storm there.

949
00:52:26,110 --> 00:52:27,805
- What do you know about Galveston?
- What are you doing?

950
00:52:27,911 --> 00:52:31,312
Great. Galveston.
Well, Galveston's the South's new gay mecca-

951
00:52:31,415 --> 00:52:33,406
one of the country's
top 10 gay-friendliest cities.

952
00:52:33,517 --> 00:52:35,644
- Huh. Gay friendly, Angus.
- Yeah. Hi, Steve.

953
00:52:35,753 --> 00:52:37,220
Is she running alongside the van?

954
00:52:37,321 --> 00:52:39,016
<i>- What else you got?
- Oh.</i>

955
00:52:39,123 --> 00:52:41,421
<i>- Biggest natural disaster in American history.
- Really?</i>

956
00:52:41,525 --> 00:52:44,824
Over 6,000 dead in Galveston alone. Yeah.
Ten- Can I have that?

957
00:52:44,928 --> 00:52:48,887
<i>- Ten nuns and 90 orphans.
- Angus, go faster.</i>

958
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:52,093
- Ask her why she's following me. Please.
- Why are you stalking him?

959
00:52:52,202 --> 00:52:56,070
I'm not-
I'm not stalking. No, I'm not stalking.

960
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:58,368
Stalking's an obsessive pursuit of prey.

961
00:52:58,475 --> 00:53:00,602
But you're kind of
following alongside his van.

962
00:53:00,711 --> 00:53:02,178
Who wouldn't?

963
00:53:02,279 --> 00:53:06,682
Steven is a smart, decent, loving-
If he allows himself, right?

964
00:53:06,784 --> 00:53:09,514
Loving, talented human being
with deep-seated fears.

965
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:12,442
<i>I'm not going anywhere, Steve.
I'm your rock. I'm your glue.</i>

966
00:53:12,443 --> 00:53:12,555
Mary.

967
00:53:12,656 --> 00:53:14,886
- Steve, hi.
- Go home. Go.

968
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:19,624
Oh.

969
00:53:19,730 --> 00:53:22,096
You should come!

970
00:53:27,271 --> 00:53:29,739
<i>You know what word you
never see in crosswords?</i>

971
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:33,606
<i>"Go." That or any other two-letter words.</i>

972
00:53:33,711 --> 00:53:35,975
<i>The word "go"-not fun.</i>

973
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:38,981
<i>The word "vamoose"-
now that's super fun.</i>

974
00:53:40,551 --> 00:53:43,645
<i>Yes. Crosswords are a lot
like life in that way.</i>

975
00:53:43,754 --> 00:53:46,245
<i>They're only boring
if you have no sense of adventure.</i>

976
00:53:46,356 --> 00:53:49,792
We didn't get to light
all the candles, Howard.

977
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:51,861
- That's okay. We can save them.
- Okay. Ooh.

978
00:53:51,962 --> 00:53:54,123
Hi, Mary. Where you been?

979
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:57,530
I'm-I'm going to-
I'm going to go meet Steve at his next job.

980
00:53:57,634 --> 00:53:59,329
- Oh.
- Yeah. Galveston.

981
00:53:59,436 --> 00:54:01,233
Yes, it's a storm.

982
00:54:01,338 --> 00:54:04,899
<i>Could you sign my autograph
book before you go?</i>

983
00:54:05,008 --> 00:54:07,806
Yeah, if I, uh- If I had a- a car...

984
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:10,812
<i>on my way to Galveston,
I could go through Durant, Oklahoma...</i>

985
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:13,644
where they have the world's largest peanut.

986
00:54:13,751 --> 00:54:16,948
I love peanuts, especially the giant ones.

987
00:54:17,054 --> 00:54:19,454
- Yeah, well, who doesn't?
- I know.

988
00:54:19,556 --> 00:54:21,615
Love them.

989
00:54:21,725 --> 00:54:23,590
<i>- There you go.
- I'll drive.</i>

990
00:54:25,129 --> 00:54:27,597
- Really?
- Yeah, why not?

991
00:54:29,533 --> 00:54:31,728
All right. Vamoose.

992
00:54:36,473 --> 00:54:38,373
Vamoose indeed.

993
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:43,376
- So, uh, what kind of car do you have?
- A Gremlin.

994
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:44,845
- What year?
- '76.

995
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:47,416
- Did you replace the two-wire ignition connector?
- Yes.

996
00:54:47,518 --> 00:54:50,976
The reverse doesn't work, and sometimes
it stalls. But otherwise, it's good as new.

997
00:54:51,088 --> 00:54:52,248
This storm could be nasty.

998
00:54:52,356 --> 00:54:54,119
Are we sure that we wanna drive into it?

999
00:54:54,224 --> 00:54:56,124
Come on. How bad could it be, right?

1000
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:59,262
<i>Storm Watch!</i>

1001
00:54:59,363 --> 00:55:03,322
<i>Hurricane LaQuisha expected to
make landfall by tomorrow morning.</i>

1002
00:55:03,433 --> 00:55:06,027
And what makes this situation
even more frightening-

1003
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:08,832
that area of Texas currently in the midst...

1004
00:55:08,939 --> 00:55:12,238
of the worst tornado season in history.

1005
00:55:12,342 --> 00:55:14,902
And here's where things get interesting.

1006
00:55:15,012 --> 00:55:17,378
<i>Add a looming cicada migration...</i>

1007
00:55:17,481 --> 00:55:20,917
<i>and no one knows just how devastating
this storm could be.</i>

1008
00:55:21,018 --> 00:55:24,715
Did you know that back in the '80s when
everyone's concern was with the aerosol cans...

1009
00:55:24,822 --> 00:55:28,349
it was actually the cows and their gases...

1010
00:55:28,458 --> 00:55:31,518
which were actually
doing the most damage to the ozone layer?

1011
00:55:34,231 --> 00:55:37,496
<i>- # Turn off your radio #

A little wrinkled old lady.

1015
00:55:51,448 --> 00:55:54,576
Yeah, that's Mother Teresa.
She's my best seller.

1016
00:55:54,685 --> 00:55:56,778
<i>- I'm an apple sculptor.
- Really?</i>

1017
00:55:56,887 --> 00:55:59,321
I love apples.

1018
00:55:59,423 --> 00:56:01,118
- Yeah?
- I do.

1019
00:56:01,225 --> 00:56:03,955
Well, I went to school for physics,
but I got bored.

1020
00:56:04,061 --> 00:56:08,862
So I, uh- So now I just make these
and sell them on AppleHeadsRule.com.

1021
00:56:08,966 --> 00:56:10,797
<i>Here, let me show you another one.</i>

1022
00:56:10,901 --> 00:56:12,801
<i>- Oh! Clay Aiken!
- Yeah, it's Clay Aiken.</i>

1023
00:56:12,903 --> 00:56:15,838
I love him!

1024
00:56:15,939 --> 00:56:17,907
You know, I was sitting at home...

1025
00:56:18,008 --> 00:56:21,944
just thinking that I had
everything I needed right there.

1026
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:27,108
And then I just thought,
maybe there's more, you know?

1027
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:29,617
Maybe this is the road
I'm supposed to be on.

1028
00:56:34,291 --> 00:56:36,816
Maybe it is.

1029
00:56:36,927 --> 00:56:40,488
<i>And now we go out to Hartman Hughes,
who's enjoying some fresh air.</i>

1030

Hartman, not getting too wet, are you?

1031
00:56:43,133 --> 00:56:48,093
Paula, the only thing keeping me
from falling into the bottomless depths...

1032
00:56:48,205 --> 00:56:50,730
of these shark-infested waters...

1033
00:56:50,841 --> 00:56:53,173
is this flimsy two-by-four railing.

1034
00:56:53,277 --> 00:56:57,008
<i>And the Galvestonians here
are hoping that this storm...</i>

1035
00:56:57,114 --> 00:57:00,743
will not surpass the storm of 1900...

1036
00:57:00,851 --> 00:57:04,150
when 6,000 people lost their lives-

1037
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:07,985
nuns, orphans washed out to sea.

1038
00:57:09,026 --> 00:57:12,655
This is Hartman Hughes in Galveston...

1039
00:57:12,763 --> 00:57:16,790

- Where?

1044
00:57:32,382 --> 00:57:36,785
- You know, you're an asshole!
- Hmm!

1045
00:57:36,954 --> 00:57:39,252
You know what? I love dressing up. I do.

1046
00:57:39,356 --> 00:57:41,984
But, guys, those panties
are short on sparkle.

1047
00:57:42,092 --> 00:57:44,219
Thank the good Lord for the BeDazzler.

1048
00:57:46,897 --> 00:57:50,993

1049
00:57:51,101 --> 00:57:53,035

1053
00:58:02,012 --> 00:58:04,810

- Okay. Oh, God!

1054
00:58:04,915 --> 00:58:08,476
<i>It will not start.
What are we gonna do?</i>

1055
00:58:08,585 --> 00:58:10,052
Okay, okay. Uh- Uh-

1056
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:11,745
<i>- Crap!

00:58:16,426 --> 00:58:18,326

1060
00:58:18,428 --> 00:58:21,022
Ow, ow, ow!

1061
00:58:26,303 --> 00:58:29,067
Come on! Keep running!

1062
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:30,833

- We have to hurry!

1063
00:58:32,476 --> 00:58:36,071
Everybody get in!
Get in and go all the way down! Hurry!

1064
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:37,476
It's blocked!

1065
00:58:37,581 --> 00:58:40,106
We're gonna be okay though.
We're gonna be fine.

1066
00:58:40,217 --> 00:58:41,946
Yea! Ponchos!

00:58:47,657 --> 00:58:49,750

Oh. Oh! Oh!

Insecta Hemiptera

Cicada.

1074
00:58:58,835 --> 00:59:01,201
This species only comes
around every 17 years!

1075
00:59:01,304 --> 00:59:04,603
<i>Add these very, very smart
cicadas to a tornado...</i>

1076
00:59:04,708 --> 00:59:07,905
it's like a once-in-a-lifetime
natural miracle!

1077
00:59:08,011 --> 00:59:11,139
- Do you know how lucky we are?
- Cool.

1078
00:59:18,522 --> 00:59:20,717
Shit!

1079
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:24,652
<i>Curse words.</i>

1080
00:59:24,761 --> 00:59:27,730
<i>Swearing, profanity,
expletives-a good old cuss.</i>

1081
00:59:27,831 --> 00:59:30,391
<i>Maybe these words aren't
such a good idea in some places...</i>

1082
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:32,968
<i>such as crosswords or kindergarten...</i>

1083
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:36,733
<i>but when amongst friends
and in a sewer...</i>

1084
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:39,172
<i>it's perfectly acceptable

1085
00:59:47,951 --> 00:59:51,409
My car.

1086
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:05,263
- Storm's over. What else is happening?
- All quiet.

1087
01:00:05,368 --> 01:00:07,495
Hey, Chris, any celebrities
arrested for drunk driving today?

1088
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:10,004
Give me the phone.

1089
01:00:10,107 --> 01:00:13,201
Angus, how in the hell
do you miss a "tornadocane"?

1090
01:00:13,310 --> 01:00:16,939
- Please, give us another chance.
- If you keep this up, you're leaving me no choice.

1091
01:00:17,047 --> 01:00:17,615
Please, sir, I-

1092
01:00:17,616 --> 01:00:19,811
Get me downed street signs,
damaged boats, drowned puppies-

1093
01:00:19,916 --> 01:00:21,247
whatever.

1094
01:00:21,351 --> 01:00:23,979
And then I want you all in my office
Tuesday morning at 9:00.

1095
01:00:24,087 --> 01:00:25,679
Sir, I'm sorry, sir, I-

1096
01:00:25,789 --> 01:00:27,689
They're through, all of them. Finished.

1097
01:00:28,792 --> 01:00:33,229
Find out if Vasquez is happy at NNC.

1098
01:00:33,330 --> 01:00:35,958
We need to go shoot some B-roll
of the storm damage.

1099
01:00:36,066 --> 01:00:37,761
I'm not scared of love.

1100
01:00:37,868 --> 01:00:40,132
I went on one date with her, Mom.
I went on one date with her.

1101
01:00:40,237 --> 01:00:43,263
<i>B- roll?</i>

1102
01:00:43,373 --> 01:00:46,171
A complete waste of my handsome gifts.

1103
01:00:46,276 --> 01:00:48,540
Where's a decent tragedy

1104

<i>Who wants to go forward?

Hey, kids. Who's ready for some fun?

1106
01:01:25,882 --> 01:01:28,077
No!

1107
01:01:28,185 --> 01:01:30,119
You can knit this handy purse.

1108
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:32,381
- But my favorite project-
- Sorry. We're gonna have to interrupt.

1109
01:01:32,489 --> 01:01:35,356
Breaking news from Silver Plume, Colorado.

1110
01:01:35,458 --> 01:01:39,417
A group of hearing-impaired children
have plummeted into an abandoned mine shaft.

1111
01:01:40,541 --> 01:01:42,225
Yeah, I just heard.
Who are we sending to cover it?

1112
01:01:42,332 --> 01:01:44,766
What?

1113
01:01:44,868 --> 01:01:47,428
<i>...blissfully unaware of what lay ahead.
- Is there no one else?</i>

1114
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:49,971
<i>There's no word yet
on injuries, John...</i>

1115
01:01:50,073 --> 01:01:53,270
<i>but we are getting reports

<i>to try and rescue those
poor deaf children...</i>

1117
01:01:56,146 --> 01:01:58,137
<i>before the ground
collapses on top of them.</i>

1118
01:01:58,248 --> 01:02:00,716
<i>- Judy, John, back to you.

1119
01:02:00,817 --> 01:02:03,377
Angus, where'd you get those?

1120
01:02:03,486 --> 01:02:06,922
- Hmm?
- Mary could have planted those.

1121
01:02:07,023 --> 01:02:10,356
- Think she poisoned our chips?
- Well, can you prove that she didn't?

1122
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:12,928
Huh? Did you buy them? I didn't buy them.

1123
01:02:13,029 --> 01:02:15,589
Did you buy-
You don't buy anything. Did you buy them?

1124
01:02:15,699 --> 01:02:18,600
<i>You know, poisoning is the number
one murder method for crazy women.</i>

1125
01:02:18,702 --> 01:02:20,602
Are you kidding me?

1126
01:02:20,704 --> 01:02:22,569
- Nope.
- Hey!

1127
01:02:22,672 --> 01:02:26,301
Everything's gotta go out.
We gotta flush it. We gotta flush it, guys.

1128
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:28,673
Give a hoot. Don't pollute.

1129
01:02:35,085 --> 01:02:36,985
- I'm sorry.
- It's not your fault.

1130
01:02:38,255 --> 01:02:41,782
You know, my old man was
a combat journalist in 'Nam.

1131
01:02:41,891 --> 01:02:44,189
<i>Hard to fill those boots, huh?</i>

1132
01:02:44,294 --> 01:02:47,354
Got killed before I ever had a chance
to say good-bye to him.

1133
01:02:48,832 --> 01:02:50,959
Yeah, if I ever get that anchor desk...

1134
01:02:51,067 --> 01:02:53,535
he's gonna be really proud of me in heaven.

1135
01:02:53,637 --> 01:02:56,697
Well, looks like we found
the eye of the storm, guys.

1136
01:02:56,806 --> 01:03:00,105
Holy shit. There's Mary.

1137
01:03:00,210 --> 01:03:02,110

1138
01:03:02,212 --> 01:03:04,339
Oh, my God. It's Steve. Steve.

1139
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:07,041
Steve.

1140
01:03:07,150 --> 01:03:09,880

- Getting some air.

1141
01:03:09,986 --> 01:03:11,544
<i>What are you writing?
You're not telling her where we're going?</i>

1142

1143
01:03:14,503 --> 01:03:15,488
- Stop it!
- No way!

1144
01:03:15,592 --> 01:03:19,028
Steve! Steve! Steve! Steve!

1145
01:03:19,129 --> 01:03:21,723
Oh, Jesus! She's got a machete!
Where the hell did she get a machete?

1146
01:03:21,831 --> 01:03:24,299
<i>Oh, man!
She's gonna pluck my eyes out, man!</i>

1147
01:03:24,401 --> 01:03:27,234
<i>She is gonna carve my eyes out
and she's gonna make me eat them!</i>

1148
01:03:27,337 --> 01:03:29,498
<i>I swear to God.
I've read about it on the Internet, man!</i>

1149
01:03:29,606 --> 01:03:32,006
Oh, my God! She's gonna cut my feet off!

1150
01:03:32,108 --> 01:03:34,576
I'm not gonna be able to walk!
She's gonna make me eat my legs!

1151
01:03:34,678 --> 01:03:36,509
She's gonna make you eat your legs?

1152
01:03:36,613 --> 01:03:38,672
- Yeah, I read about it!
- Oh, really?

1153
01:03:38,782 --> 01:03:40,750
What, some sort of pimento leg loaf?

1154
01:03:40,850 --> 01:03:43,683
Hey! You think this is funny? I've read up on this!

1155
01:03:43,787 --> 01:03:47,223
<i>- I know it's not the same thing as-
- Just shut up. Just shut up.</i>

1156
01:03:47,324 --> 01:03:49,292
Just shut up! Just shut the heck up!

1157
01:03:49,392 --> 01:03:51,917
- I swear to-
- Shut up! All right?

1158
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:56,188
Jesus! Where do I begin?

1159
01:03:56,299 --> 01:04:00,429
Hartman, for the love of God, stop tanning.

1160
01:04:00,537 --> 01:04:02,095
You look like a Cheese Nip!

1161
01:04:02,205 --> 01:04:04,867
<i>You look like an orange with lips!</i>

1162
01:04:04,974 --> 01:04:07,408
You look like a wrinkled peach!

1163
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:11,503
And you! Geraldo! Lose the wig!

1164
01:04:11,614 --> 01:04:13,878
You look like a retired porn star.

1165
01:04:13,983 --> 01:04:17,714
<i>Who you fooling?
Oh, that's a great disguise, Einstein.</i>

1166
01:04:17,821 --> 01:04:20,153
The van's the same, dumb-ass!

1167
01:04:22,325 --> 01:04:26,193
<i>Mary is not a psycho.
You're the psycho.</i>

1168
01:04:26,296 --> 01:04:28,196
She's just a smart girl with red boots.

1169
01:04:38,041 --> 01:04:40,475
<i>That's good work, Angus.</i>

1170
01:04:40,577 --> 01:04:43,137
<i>I knew you had some
balls in those Underoos.</i>

1171
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:47,615
Okay. Ooh. Okay.

1172
01:04:47,717 --> 01:04:49,548
"Deaf kids in a mine. Silver Plume.

1173
01:04:49,652 --> 01:04:52,280
Please 'meat' me."

1174
01:04:55,091 --> 01:04:56,991
"Meat."

1175
01:05:00,163 --> 01:05:03,792
"Please meat"- M-E-A-T.

1176
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:08,269
<i>"Please meat me there. XO, Steve."</i>

1177
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:13,297
See? He needs me,
if only to help with his spelling.

1178
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:21,940
You know what one of my favorite ingredients
of crosswording is? Perseverance.

1179
01:05:22,051 --> 01:05:24,246
If you quit a puzzle, you can't finish it.

1180
01:05:25,755 --> 01:05:27,655
Sure, every once in a while,
you run into a doozy...

1181
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:30,123
that you don't think you could ever solve
in a million years...

1182
01:05:30,226 --> 01:05:32,524
but if you stick with it, you figure it out.

1183
01:05:37,066 --> 01:05:38,533
Eventually.

1184
01:05:41,971 --> 01:05:44,804
Worst thing you can do
is leave it unfinished.

1185
01:05:47,210 --> 01:05:49,678
It's never the solution, is it?

1186
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:53,476
You know what my favorite part of a crossword is?

1187
01:05:55,552 --> 01:05:58,544
When you realize you know something
you didn't think you knew.

1188
01:05:59,823 --> 01:06:01,791
Maybe.

1189
01:06:03,660 --> 01:06:05,685
To Colorado then?

1190
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:10,596
<i>- # You got all the sugar#
- Yea!</i>

1191
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:13,328
<i># You'll ever need ##</i>

1192
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:17,997
Hey, people, back it up!

1193
01:06:18,107 --> 01:06:21,372
This ground can collapse at any time,
so please, please back it up!

1194
01:06:21,478 --> 01:06:23,810
<i>Here we go, guys.
Start lowering him down.</i>

1195
01:06:28,318 --> 01:06:30,218
Vasquez.

1196
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:33,084
Hey, what's he doing with his hands?

1197
01:06:36,693 --> 01:06:38,593
Son of a bitch.

1198
01:06:38,695 --> 01:06:42,028
I haven't had my big moment yet,
so I gotta find something.

1199
01:06:42,131 --> 01:06:43,894
They're all okay!

1200
01:06:47,237 --> 01:06:49,467
All right, on three.

1201
01:06:49,572 --> 01:06:51,597
Three, two, one.

1202
01:06:51,708 --> 01:06:54,404
Elation here in Colorado...

1203
01:06:54,511 --> 01:06:57,844
and yet danger lurking at every corner...

1204
01:06:57,947 --> 01:07:02,407
as rescuers bring the "besmudged"
little cherubs up one at a time.

1205
01:07:05,121 --> 01:07:07,089
Thank God they're all right.

1206
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:10,750
Thank you, God.

1207
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:26,609
That's the last of them!

1208
01:07:31,814 --> 01:07:33,714
He's out.

1209
01:07:35,552 --> 01:07:37,986
<i>The last child is now rescued...</i>

1210
01:07:38,087 --> 01:07:40,282
<i>with the parents rejoicing
along with the many workers.</i>

1211
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:42,688
<i>Wait. Wait a minute.
There's something happening.</i>

1212
01:07:42,792 --> 01:07:44,692
<i>- Oh!
- The ground seems to be collapsing.</i>

1213
01:07:44,794 --> 01:07:47,126
<i>The heavy crane is actually shaking.
Oh, this is terrible.</i>

1214
01:07:59,876 --> 01:08:02,743
<i>
Yes, it's dangerous there.</i>

1215
01:08:03,446 --> 01:08:04,913
<i>What happened?</i>

1216
01:08:05,348 --> 01:08:06,548
<i>I don't know...</i>

1217
01:08:06,583 --> 01:08:09,017
<i>I don't know...
but I smell a lawsuit.</i>

1218
01:08:09,118 --> 01:08:12,679
<i>A happy ending, and yet parents
around the country wondering...</i>

1219
01:08:12,789 --> 01:08:15,656
"Is my family in danger
from an abandoned mine?

1220
01:08:15,758 --> 01:08:18,659
<i>Is my backyard an abandoned mine?"</i>

1221
01:08:18,761 --> 01:08:21,423
<i>Danger's passed!</i>

1222
01:08:21,531 --> 01:08:23,829
<i>Thank God they're all safe.</i>

1223
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:25,992
<i>Is that him?</i>

1224
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:28,798
Yeah.

1225
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:37,807
Well.
"Truth is truth, to the end of reckoning."

1226
01:08:37,914 --> 01:08:39,882
Shakespeare.

1227
01:08:48,591 --> 01:08:50,684
And I say to these complete strangers-

1228
01:08:55,632 --> 01:08:58,567
- Bye.
- Bye.

1229
01:09:07,910 --> 01:09:10,970
...one that has left parents
across this country wondering...

1230
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:13,844
"How do I keep my family safe
from abandoned mines?

1231
01:09:13,950 --> 01:09:16,578
<i>"Is my bedroom-and more to the point-</i>

1232
01:09:16,686 --> 01:09:17,983
Holy shit.

<i>"my king-sized bed- on
top of an abandoned mine?</i>

1234
01:09:21,424 --> 01:09:25,258
"Is my child's school built

1235
01:09:25,361 --> 01:09:28,159
<i>- Are abandoned mines always unsafe?"
- Did you see that?</i>

1236
01:09:28,264 --> 01:09:31,256
- Mary's in the hole.
- Don't be ridiculous.

1237
01:09:31,367 --> 01:09:33,562
<i>Somebody else went in!</i>

1238
01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:36,161
<i>Cut! Get over there!</i>

1239
01:09:36,272 --> 01:09:38,001
- Get back from the tape now!
- What?

1240
01:09:38,107 --> 01:09:39,768
<i>Come on, handheld.
Come on, let's go!</i>

1241
01:09:39,876 --> 01:09:41,707
Did somebody fall in the mine?

1242
01:09:44,781 --> 01:09:47,841
Tell her help is on the way.
We're working on getting a new crane.

1243
01:09:47,950 --> 01:09:50,282
We just need her to confirm she's conscious.

1244
01:09:50,386 --> 01:09:52,354
Here. Give me that.

1245
01:09:52,455 --> 01:09:54,355
<i>All rescue personnel on scene...</i>

1246
01:09:54,457 --> 01:09:57,858
<i>apparently we have another victim
who has gone into the hole at the mine.</i>

1247
01:10:13,843 --> 01:10:16,471
Okay, I am not afraid.

1248
01:10:16,579 --> 01:10:20,948
I'm not afraid, nor am I affrightened.

1249
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:22,950
Okay.

1250
01:10:28,858 --> 01:10:30,758
Uh-

1251
01:10:30,860 --> 01:10:32,760
Hello!

1252
01:10:32,862 --> 01:10:35,262
It is me, Mary Horowitz.

1253
01:10:35,364 --> 01:10:38,595
Yes, I seem to have fallen into the mine.

1254
01:10:38,701 --> 01:10:41,534
Hello? Everyone?

1255
01:10:41,637 --> 01:10:45,232
It's, uh, me, Mary Horowitz. Hello?

1256
01:10:45,341 --> 01:10:48,105
People, please move back.

1257
01:10:48,211 --> 01:10:50,771
<i>- Back up! Back it up.
- This ground is unstable.</i>

1258
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:54,976
So she just dove in
that hole, like a gopher.

1259
01:10:55,084 --> 01:10:58,349
No, dude, not like a gopher.
Like a human being.

1260
01:10:58,454 --> 01:11:00,581
She was running after me,
and she fell in the hole.

1261
01:11:00,690 --> 01:11:02,817
<i> That's the way to get
your heads out of your asses.</i>

1262
01:11:02,925 --> 01:11:05,758
That shot of Steve's girlfriend
falling into the pit is priceless.

1263
01:11:05,862 --> 01:11:08,763
We've got the inside advantage here,
so let's use it.

1264
01:11:08,865 --> 01:11:11,163
Get Steve ready to go on
and talk about his girlfriend...

1265
01:11:11,267 --> 01:11:13,497
as soon as we get the graphics together.

1266
01:11:13,603 --> 01:11:16,265
Fifteen minutes.

1267
01:11:16,372 --> 01:11:18,636
- Here he comes!
- You people are ruining the ferns!

1268
01:11:18,741 --> 01:11:22,404
Can you comment on the rumors that Mary's
fall into the mine was a suicide attempt?

1269
01:11:22,512 --> 01:11:25,845
Well-That's ridiculous. Not our Mary.

1270
01:11:25,948 --> 01:11:30,385
The word "depression"
is not in her vocabulary.

1271
01:11:30,486 --> 01:11:33,887
All right, obviously
it is in her vocabulary.

1272
01:11:33,990 --> 01:11:35,890
But no. No.

1273
01:11:35,992 --> 01:11:38,392
She-She never lets anything get her down.

1274
01:11:38,494 --> 01:11:41,156
Still living at home at her age-
clearly not a normal situation.

1275
01:11:41,264 --> 01:11:42,629
Not normal?

1276
01:11:42,732 --> 01:11:44,290
We-We love having her here.

1277
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:45,992
<i>Sir, I'd like to ask
another question.</i>

1278
01:11:46,102 --> 01:11:48,400
- Yes. Yes, we love having her here.
- Yes, we do.

1279
01:11:48,504 --> 01:11:50,495
Fumigation can't be rushed.

1280
01:11:52,408 --> 01:11:54,842
One more question!

1281
01:11:54,944 --> 01:11:57,242
Now, I don't wanna speculate here...

1282
01:11:57,346 --> 01:11:59,371
<i>- but if the ground did collapse...
- Ow! Ow! Ow!</i>

1283
01:11:59,482 --> 01:12:01,382
<i>could that not result in death...</i>

1284
01:12:01,484 --> 01:12:05,352
<i>or, at the absolute least,
horrible disfigurement?</i>

1285
01:12:05,454 --> 01:12:09,720
I don't wanna speculate either,
but, yes, absolutely, it could.

1286
01:12:09,826 --> 01:12:12,488
And as we await the tragic
fate of Mary Horowitz...

1287
01:12:12,595 --> 01:12:16,361
attention now on the boots she was wearing
when she slipped into the mine...

1288
01:12:16,465 --> 01:12:19,593
a story I couldn't tell
until I'd walked a mile in Mary's shoes.

1289
01:12:19,702 --> 01:12:21,169
Take a look.

1290
01:12:21,270 --> 01:12:26,230
It's hour one, and it's as if
my feet have been placed in vise grips.

1291
01:12:27,877 --> 01:12:31,574
We're at the two-hour mark,
and, actually, right now I feel pretty-

1292
01:12:31,681 --> 01:12:34,445
Oh!

1293
01:12:34,550 --> 01:12:37,713
<i>Light source.</i>

1296
01:12:51,767 --> 01:12:54,497
Oh. Voilà. Yes.

1297
01:12:54,604 --> 01:12:56,572
Yes, it's perfect. Yes. This is per-

1298
01:12:58,908 --> 01:13:00,933
Ah! Oh!

1299
01:13:01,043 --> 01:13:04,570
<i>Oh, my God. They forgot one.</i>

1300
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:06,773
You scared the crap out of me.

1301
01:13:08,818 --> 01:13:12,015
Hi. I'm-I'm sorry.

1302
01:13:12,121 --> 01:13:14,646
Uh, can you, uh-

1303
01:13:14,757 --> 01:13:18,591
Can you- Can you hear me? I mean, at all?

1304
01:13:19,695 --> 01:13:21,754
Do you have sensory-neural hearing loss...

1305
01:13:21,864 --> 01:13:23,832
or do you have conductive?

1306
01:13:23,933 --> 01:13:26,925
Because if-if it-

1307
01:13:27,036 --> 01:13:28,936
She doesn't hear me. Okay.

1308
01:13:29,038 --> 01:13:31,131
You know, I understand
a little bit of sign language...

1309
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:33,800
so if you wanna-you know? No? Okay.

1310
01:13:33,910 --> 01:13:37,004
Um, " Deaf people can do anything
except for hear."

1311
01:13:37,113 --> 01:13:38,910
Do you know who said that?

1312
01:13:39,015 --> 01:13:42,576
Dr. Jordan-
first deaf president at Gallaudet U.

1313
01:13:42,685 --> 01:13:46,086
Yeah. Maybe you'll go there one day.

1314
01:13:46,188 --> 01:13:48,486
If we both don't perish in here.

1315
01:13:50,226 --> 01:13:52,990
Hold on. I'll be right back.
You stay here, okay? Okay? Right.

1316
01:13:55,698 --> 01:13:59,361
<i>Well, Paula, apparently they're gonna
keep it old-school and simple-</i>

1317
01:13:59,468 --> 01:14:01,629
a piece of paper, a number two pencil.

1318
01:14:01,737 --> 01:14:04,228
This is Hartman Hughes
reporting from the edge.

1319
01:14:04,340 --> 01:14:06,137
Cut. Corbitt wants you on next.

1320
01:14:06,242 --> 01:14:08,472
I told you I am not her boyfriend, Angus.

1321
01:14:08,577 --> 01:14:11,341
Yeah, but you're the one that encouraged her
to come here to begin with.

1322
01:14:11,447 --> 01:14:13,570
You're the one that asked her
to come here, not me!

1323
01:14:13,571 --> 01:14:13,938
Guys! Guys!

1324
01:14:14,050 --> 01:14:16,951
NNC has got their hands
on everything but her panty size.

1325
01:14:17,053 --> 01:14:18,520
- What?
- Our Mary?

1326
01:14:18,621 --> 01:14:22,250
<i>- Yes.
- Son of a bitch. Vasquez scooped us?</i>

1327
01:14:26,228 --> 01:14:28,560
Behold, notice of our imminent rescue.

1328
01:14:28,664 --> 01:14:31,155
Oh, okay. Okay.

1329
01:14:31,267 --> 01:14:34,065
This is good news. This is good news, okay?

1330
01:14:34,170 --> 01:14:36,832
They're going to tell
us something wonderful.

1331
01:14:36,939 --> 01:14:40,898
And it says, "Mary, are you"-

1332
01:14:41,010 --> 01:14:42,978
Oh.

1333
01:14:48,985 --> 01:14:50,885
That's a good sign right there.

1334
01:14:50,987 --> 01:14:53,217
Oh, God!

1335
01:14:56,359 --> 01:14:59,123
What's it say, son?

1336
01:14:59,228 --> 01:15:01,128
Millions of people are watching.

1337
01:15:01,230 --> 01:15:02,720
Um, okay.

1338
01:15:02,832 --> 01:15:05,767
"I think you mean, am I conscious?
Not, am I conscience?

1339
01:15:08,304 --> 01:15:11,102
<i>"'Conscious' means alert and awake.</i>

1340
01:15:11,207 --> 01:15:13,573
"'Conscience' is your
inner morality gauge...

1341
01:15:13,676 --> 01:15:16,474
"you know, the thing
that stops you from doing bad things...

1342
01:15:16,579 --> 01:15:20,572
e.g., killing, stealing,
harming helpless animals and whatnot."

1343
01:15:20,683 --> 01:15:22,844
Can we leave her down there?

1344
01:15:22,952 --> 01:15:25,853
"To answer your question,
yes, I am conscious.

1345
01:15:25,955 --> 01:15:29,118
" My leg is bleeding, though I'll probably live.

1346
01:15:29,225 --> 01:15:32,388
- Yours truly, Mary Horowitz."
- Yes!

1347
01:15:32,495 --> 01:15:34,622
"P.S. Did anyone lose a little deaf girl?

1348
01:15:34,730 --> 01:15:38,791
I found one. She's fine,
other than not being able to hear, I mean."

1349
01:15:40,970 --> 01:15:44,098
They missed a child?
Can't these people count?

1350
01:15:44,206 --> 01:15:46,265
Thank God for this woman Mary Horowitz.

1351
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:48,900
Let's bring up that picture of her again.

1352
01:15:49,011 --> 01:15:50,911
Yesterday, Mary Horowitz.

1353
01:15:51,013 --> 01:15:54,107
Today, Mary Horowitz- hero.

1354
01:15:54,216 --> 01:15:56,207
<i>- This just in-
- I'm coming to save you!</i>

1355
01:15:56,318 --> 01:15:59,412
speculation as to whether or not Mary
intentionally heaved herself into the mine...

1356
01:15:59,522 --> 01:16:01,547
to save the poor deaf child...

1357
01:16:01,657 --> 01:16:05,354
after rescuers ignored her
desperate, desperate pleas.

1358
01:16:05,761 --> 01:16:07,558
<i>Paula, I'm here with Steve Muller.</i>

1359
01:16:07,663 --> 01:16:10,154
Steve's girlfriend, Mary Horowitz...

1360
01:16:10,266 --> 01:16:13,724
struggling for her life
down in the abandoned mine, as we speak.

1361
01:16:13,836 --> 01:16:17,431
She's not my girlfriend, and I'm not
gonna say that just to get ratings. Okay?

1362
01:16:17,540 --> 01:16:19,974
Yeah, and the truth is
I don't really even wanna do this.

1363
01:16:20,076 --> 01:16:23,341
<i>Mary Horowitz,
described as "freakishly intelligent."</i>

1364
01:16:23,446 --> 01:16:26,711
These words also described
Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber.

1365
01:16:26,816 --> 01:16:29,979
However, you never know about these people.
They're clean-cut-

1366
01:16:30,086 --> 01:16:32,884
But people deserve to
know the truth about her.

1367
01:16:35,591 --> 01:16:38,617
I mean, she sees things
that other people don't.

1368
01:16:38,727 --> 01:16:42,857
And she's kind, and-
and I think she means well...

1369
01:16:42,965 --> 01:16:47,459
even though, when she does things,
they're just a little unusual.

1370
01:16:48,804 --> 01:16:50,863
And she's smart. She's super smart.

1371
01:16:50,973 --> 01:16:53,737
And not in a freakish way. In-

1372
01:16:53,843 --> 01:16:57,210
Like, she has a gift.
I mean, she knows everything...

1373
01:16:57,313 --> 01:17:01,875
everything but whom not to trust
and how not to get hurt and-

1374
01:17:03,953 --> 01:17:05,921
and how to survive us.

1375
01:17:09,391 --> 01:17:11,518
And she doesn't pretend to be
somebody that she's not.

1376
01:17:14,130 --> 01:17:17,691
And she certainly doesn't
deserve to be where she is now.

1377
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:19,495
<i>Maybe if I just do this, I can-</i>

1378
01:17:19,602 --> 01:17:22,196
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

1379
01:17:27,343 --> 01:17:30,210
Yeah. The tracks down there just-

1380
01:17:30,312 --> 01:17:32,303
just keep going and going down and-

1381
01:17:33,630 --> 01:17:36,942
If we just concentrate on this
and that and that, then we'll-

1382
01:17:37,052 --> 01:17:38,952
But not to- not to worry.

1383
01:17:39,054 --> 01:17:41,648
I'll- I'll get us out of here.

1384
01:17:43,092 --> 01:17:45,458
Hope that crane gets here soon.

1385
01:17:45,561 --> 01:17:48,155
I hope so too.

1386
01:17:48,264 --> 01:17:50,164
'Cause if there's carbon
monoxide down there-

1387
01:17:50,266 --> 01:17:52,166
But the air's coming through the top.

1388
01:17:52,268 --> 01:17:55,897
Even at concentrations of five ppm,
they could suffocate.

1389
01:18:03,279 --> 01:18:06,009
I am so sorry.

1390
01:18:10,186 --> 01:18:14,714
She has stolen a little piece of my heart.

1391
01:18:14,823 --> 01:18:19,089
<i>- What'd the site engineer say?
- The stress fractures are worsening by the minute.</i>

1392
01:18:19,195 --> 01:18:22,062
The longer they're down there,
the greater the chance of collapse.

1393
01:18:22,164 --> 01:18:23,688
They thought the air quality was bad...

1394
01:18:23,799 --> 01:18:25,733
try a 50-foot span of rock and earth
dropping down there.

1395
01:18:25,834 --> 01:18:27,301
Oh, Jesus.

1396
01:18:27,403 --> 01:18:30,236
That's a bunch of horseshit.
She's gonna be fine.

1397
01:18:30,339 --> 01:18:32,705
Odds are she won't. We gotta go on.

1398
01:18:32,808 --> 01:18:35,174
What are we gonna say?
Say she's not gonna make it?

1399
01:18:35,277 --> 01:18:37,438
Her whole family is watching, Angus. Christ.

1400
01:18:37,546 --> 01:18:39,844
- I'll be back in a minute.
- Hughes.

1401
01:18:39,949 --> 01:18:41,849
All right, two minutes. That's it.

1402
01:18:41,951 --> 01:18:44,511
Some blind date, huh?

1403
01:18:46,755 --> 01:18:48,655
Here's a candle.

1404
01:18:50,559 --> 01:18:52,527
Hi, Winston.

1405
01:18:55,164 --> 01:18:59,601
I think I'll feel better if I pretend
that it's Mary's surprise party.

1406
01:19:03,505 --> 01:19:07,999
I'm making an apple head for Mary
for when she gets out.

1407
01:19:08,110 --> 01:19:12,012
<i>- And she's gonna get out.
- # And I don't know #</i>

1408
01:19:12,114 --> 01:19:17,780
<i># Why life, it seems to be #</i>

1409
01:19:19,255 --> 01:19:25,285
<i>- This one's gonna work.
- # So hard for dreamers #</i>

1410
01:19:25,394 --> 01:19:28,363
<i># Like you and me #</i>

1411
01:19:28,464 --> 01:19:32,298
<i> Rescuers are desperate
for the crane to reach them within the hour.</i>

1412
01:19:32,401 --> 01:19:35,461
Helicopters are out of the
question because of all the power lines.

1413
01:19:35,571 --> 01:19:37,664
Hope is fading fast.

1414
01:19:37,773 --> 01:19:41,436
The earth tremors are
getting stronger. They have to get out soon.

1415
01:19:41,543 --> 01:19:47,482
<i># Is everywhere ##</i>

1416
01:19:47,583 --> 01:19:50,279
The other side. Oh!

1417
01:19:50,386 --> 01:19:52,877
Ouch too.

1418
01:20:00,496 --> 01:20:04,990
I can't do this. I can't get us out of here.

1419
01:20:08,504 --> 01:20:10,734
Guess what.

1420
01:20:10,839 --> 01:20:14,002
Mary Horowitz doesn't have the answers.

1421
01:20:14,109 --> 01:20:16,407
Or a job.

1422
01:20:19,515 --> 01:20:22,348
And-And my job mattered!

1423
01:20:25,421 --> 01:20:28,618
<i>I was the Sacramento Herald's
crossword constructor...</i>

1424
01:20:28,724 --> 01:20:31,784
and I threw it all away- for what?

1425
01:20:36,665 --> 01:20:40,362
"Mary, Steve wants you to come be with us.
He needs you."

1426
01:20:40,469 --> 01:20:43,563
Really? Methinks the media lies.

1427
01:20:43,672 --> 01:20:46,505
A little.

1428
01:20:46,608 --> 01:20:49,168
Words, people. Words.

1429
01:20:50,546 --> 01:20:54,073
There are meaningful words,
there are pointless words...

1430
01:20:54,183 --> 01:20:57,243
and then there are words that hurt.

1431
01:21:01,056 --> 01:21:04,583
"Mary, why can't you be
like every other girl?"

1432
01:21:04,693 --> 01:21:08,686
<i>"Mary, where do you get
all that useless information?"</i>

1433
01:21:08,797 --> 01:21:10,924
"Mary, why do you talk like that?"

1434
01:21:11,033 --> 01:21:13,695
<i>"Mary, Mary!"
You know, it's just-just-</i>

1435
01:21:13,802 --> 01:21:15,827
Oh, oh! Oh! Oh!

1436
01:21:15,938 --> 01:21:18,600
And the pièce de résistance, yes.

1437
01:21:18,707 --> 01:21:22,939
"Mary, why do you wear
those stupid red boots all the time?"

1438
01:21:23,045 --> 01:21:25,138
You wanna know why? Huh?

1439
01:21:25,247 --> 01:21:27,408
Do you wanna know why?
Okay, I will tell you why.

1440
01:21:27,516 --> 01:21:31,008
<i>I wear them because they
make my toes feel...</i>

1441
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:34,749
like 10 friends on a camping trip.

1442
01:21:34,857 --> 01:21:36,757
That's why I wear them.

1443
01:21:41,830 --> 01:21:44,355
We're finished.

1444
01:21:44,466 --> 01:21:47,435
The ground is gonna collapse.
We're gonna perish.

1445
01:21:47,536 --> 01:21:49,504
I just wanna go home.

1446
01:21:54,343 --> 01:21:56,243
Sorry.

1447
01:22:00,983 --> 01:22:05,215
<i>"I don't know what you're saying,
but you talk too much. "</i>

1448
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:09,484
I know.

1449
01:22:11,794 --> 01:22:13,694
I know.

1450
01:22:29,044 --> 01:22:32,070
Ma'am, I'm sorry.
You're gonna have to step back.

1451
01:22:32,181 --> 01:22:34,741
<i>- Hughes!
- Not now.</i>

1452
01:22:34,850 --> 01:22:36,943
<i>You wrote the note
telling Mary to come here.</i>

1453
01:22:38,854 --> 01:22:42,017
You brought her here. And if she dies-

1454
01:22:48,297 --> 01:22:50,959
This is just a fence.

1455
01:22:51,066 --> 01:22:53,557
Being on that side of it
doesn't make you any better.

1456
01:23:00,242 --> 01:23:02,506
You did that.

1457
01:23:02,611 --> 01:23:04,875
...cheated on her taxes-
...and the red boots-

1458
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:07,505
<i>Does she think herself
some kind of superhero?</i>

1459
01:23:07,616 --> 01:23:09,709
Mary-

1460
01:23:11,587 --> 01:23:13,384
she did this.

1461
01:24:10,779 --> 01:24:13,475
He was my ticket to normal.

1462
01:24:14,583 --> 01:24:15,880
Yeah.

1463
01:24:15,984 --> 01:24:19,147
"Why would you want to be normal?"

1464
01:24:22,257 --> 01:24:25,988
I don't. I don't.

1465
01:24:27,729 --> 01:24:29,629
These will keep you warm.

1466
01:24:31,199 --> 01:24:33,099
Yeah.

1467
01:24:33,201 --> 01:24:38,935
"Maybe someone will
figure out how to save us."

1468
01:24:43,078 --> 01:24:45,774
Maybe. Maybe.

1469
01:24:51,286 --> 01:24:53,186
Say that again.

1470
01:24:54,723 --> 01:24:56,623
"Maybe someone"-

1471
01:25:01,263 --> 01:25:04,926
"Maybe." "Maybe."

1472
01:25:09,271 --> 01:25:13,264
Little deaf girl,
it's time for us to go home.

1473
01:25:15,310 --> 01:25:17,278
Why aren't they doing anything?

1474
01:25:19,481 --> 01:25:22,109
How much- How much do you weigh?

1475
01:25:24,886 --> 01:25:28,049
Fifty pounds, give or take? Okay.

1476
01:25:29,057 --> 01:25:31,116
See.

1477
01:25:33,061 --> 01:25:35,552
Okay, just get it right down here.

1478
01:25:35,664 --> 01:25:37,632
Just get all over the joints.

1479
01:25:37,733 --> 01:25:39,633
When I got kicked out of Girl Scouts...

1480
01:25:39,735 --> 01:25:41,930
and all the other girls were
learning how to sell cookies...

1481
01:25:42,037 --> 01:25:46,337
I was at home- ow- reading physics books.

1482
01:25:46,441 --> 01:25:49,342
Voilà.

1483
01:25:49,444 --> 01:25:52,538
<i>Hartman.
What are you doing? I told you two minutes.</i>

1484
01:25:52,648 --> 01:25:54,980
It's my fault Mary's in the hole.

1485
01:25:55,083 --> 01:25:56,812
But like Patton said...

1486

1493
01:26:24,946 --> 01:26:26,971
One, two-

1494
01:26:34,056 --> 01:26:37,787
Oh! Okay! Pretty good drop.

1495
01:26:37,893 --> 01:26:39,861
You guys doing all right?

1496
01:26:39,961 --> 01:26:43,795
Mm-hmm. But we were just on-on, you know-

1497
01:26:43,899 --> 01:26:46,390
Something just touched me! Something bit me!

1498
01:26:46,501 --> 01:26:50,460
Something- Help!

1499
01:26:50,572 --> 01:26:52,597
There's something in that water.

1500
01:26:52,708 --> 01:26:56,109
Something ni-nibbled at my leg.

1501
01:26:56,211 --> 01:27:00,545
Hartman Hughes just jumped-
I repeat, jumped into the mine.

1502
01:27:00,649 --> 01:27:03,277
<i> Grabbing on to a hose
that was attached to nothing...</i>

1503
01:27:03,385 --> 01:27:06,252
he literally dove right into the mine.

1504
01:27:06,354 --> 01:27:08,720
All eyes now not only on Mary Horowitz...

1505
01:27:08,824 --> 01:27:12,157
but also CCN reporter Hartman Hughes.

1506
01:27:13,695 --> 01:27:16,095
Why the hell didn't I think of that?

1507
01:27:16,198 --> 01:27:20,464
Did you check the perimeter for spiders?

1508
01:27:20,569 --> 01:27:22,469
Uh, yes. Yes, I did.

1509
01:27:23,772 --> 01:27:27,299
It's really... scary down here.

1510
01:27:31,012 --> 01:27:34,038
You know, if my old man could see me now.

1511

I'm sorry.

1512
01:27:40,522 --> 01:27:43,685

1517
01:28:01,643 --> 01:28:05,977
I'll be cradling her here,
and I'll be cradling you here.

1518
01:28:06,081 --> 01:28:11,451
Maybe you-you would like
to be holding us like this when we go up.

1519
01:28:11,553 --> 01:28:15,284
No, no. It's your plan,
and I don't wanna take the credit.

1520
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:21,620
- I'd like to take the credit.
- Okay. All right.

1521
01:28:22,746 --> 01:28:25,598
