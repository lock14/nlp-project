1
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,394
Björling.

2
00:01:42,036 --> 00:01:43,366
Suliotis?

3
00:01:43,537 --> 00:01:44,868
Close.

4
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:46,665
Björling is easy.

5
00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:55,311
Tebaldi.

6
00:01:56,016 --> 00:01:58,042
- You win.
- My turn.

7
00:02:09,897 --> 00:02:12,128
- No looking.
- I'm not.

8
00:02:12,867 --> 00:02:14,528
Did Daddy look?

9
00:02:14,703 --> 00:02:16,397
No.

10
00:02:17,573 --> 00:02:18,870
You sure?

11
00:02:19,641 --> 00:02:21,871
- Yes.
- Okay.

12
00:02:32,087 --> 00:02:34,146
Oh, God.

13
00:02:35,758 --> 00:02:37,088
Gigli?

14
00:02:37,894 --> 00:02:39,953
Of course, but what?

15
00:02:58,481 --> 00:03:01,679
Well? Darling?

16
00:03:08,491 --> 00:03:10,652
I'd say Handel.

17
00:03:11,193 --> 00:03:13,459
Right. But what is it?

18
00:03:15,331 --> 00:03:16,823
Not a clue.

19
00:03:23,508 --> 00:03:25,998
- Well?
- I give up. What is it?

20
00:03:26,176 --> 00:03:28,337
Three-two to me.

21
00:03:31,984 --> 00:03:37,444
Hey, hands off.
Hey, no. Just... Just listen.

22
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:03,942
Hey! That's not fair.

23
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:06,507
What?

24
00:05:07,214 --> 00:05:10,048
Practicing's not fair.

25
00:05:11,119 --> 00:05:13,586
You're still on for 10 tomorrow, right?

26
00:05:14,588 --> 00:05:16,079
You're still coming?

27
00:05:19,894 --> 00:05:21,226
Uh, yeah, sure.

28
00:05:27,636 --> 00:05:29,103
We have to launch the boat.

29
00:05:29,271 --> 00:05:32,139
Can you give us a hand,
in about 20 minutes?

30
00:05:32,307 --> 00:05:36,471
Yeah, sure. Yeah, I'll be there.
I'll come over in 20 minutes.

31
00:05:37,112 --> 00:05:39,172
Okay, great. See you then.

32
00:05:39,346 --> 00:05:41,178
Bye!

33
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:51,617
What was up with him?

34
00:05:51,961 --> 00:05:53,622
Don't know.

35
00:05:54,298 --> 00:05:56,060
Seems weird.

36
00:05:57,466 --> 00:05:59,957
She didn't say a word.

37
00:06:01,603 --> 00:06:03,697
Who did you talk to
about the game tomorrow?

38
00:06:03,874 --> 00:06:05,170
With her.

39
00:06:05,341 --> 00:06:08,834
- When?
- Day before yesterday.

40
00:06:09,012 --> 00:06:12,641
- And?
- Nothing, she was fine.

41
00:06:12,815 --> 00:06:14,148
Where's Jenny?

42
00:06:14,317 --> 00:06:18,481
I don't know, sweetheart.
Maybe she's at the beach or inside.

43
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:23,726
- Who were those guys?
- Don't know.

44
00:06:23,961 --> 00:06:27,829
Maybe relatives.
Doesn't her brother have a son that age?

45
00:07:04,737 --> 00:07:08,264
Don't put that there.
Take your stuff upstairs, please.

46
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:09,567
Yeah.

47
00:07:09,742 --> 00:07:12,507
Keep the doorway clear
or someone's gonna trip.

48
00:07:12,677 --> 00:07:15,168
We have a lot more in the car.

49
00:07:16,682 --> 00:07:18,742
Hey, are you listening to me?

50
00:07:18,918 --> 00:07:20,750
I'm going, already.

51
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:24,185
Open the windows, please.
We need to let some air in.

52
00:07:24,355 --> 00:07:26,257
Yeah, Mom.

53
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:36,858
Get out, Lucky. Out.

54
00:07:38,271 --> 00:07:40,865
Come on, get down.

55
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:44,872
Come on.

56
00:07:47,415 --> 00:07:49,314
- George?
- Yeah?

57
00:07:49,483 --> 00:07:51,417
Where are the other groceries?

58
00:07:51,586 --> 00:07:53,314
I'll get it.

59
00:07:53,487 --> 00:07:56,216
Golf clubs were in the way.

60
00:07:57,457 --> 00:08:00,290
Hurry up, everything's getting warm.

61
00:08:02,062 --> 00:08:04,963
This cooler's a piece of shit.

62
00:08:06,067 --> 00:08:07,932
Stop it, buddy.

63
00:08:08,269 --> 00:08:10,259
You'll knock me over.

64
00:08:10,471 --> 00:08:13,771
Go to Mommy, go on, go to Mommy.
She'll give you a treat.

65
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,466
The meat's in the other box.
Will you grab it for me?

66
00:08:16,711 --> 00:08:18,144
I'm just opening the windows.

67
00:08:18,312 --> 00:08:21,305
Leave the shutters in the front,
it'll get too hot.

68
00:08:21,617 --> 00:08:23,812
Lucky, come on. Honey, get out.

69
00:08:23,985 --> 00:08:26,648
Will you...? Come on,
I'll get you something in a minute.

70
00:08:26,822 --> 00:08:30,588
Lucky, please.
Will you call the dog, honey?

71
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:32,090
Lucky, get out of here.

72
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,661
- Call the dog.
- Lucky.

73
00:08:33,828 --> 00:08:34,955
Go on, honey.

74
00:08:35,129 --> 00:08:37,154
Come here, come to Daddy.

75
00:08:44,374 --> 00:08:46,774
Stop it, Lucky. Be quiet.

76
00:08:47,809 --> 00:08:49,504
I'm sorry. He's...

77
00:08:49,678 --> 00:08:52,442
He's nuts. Come in.

78
00:08:53,316 --> 00:08:56,342
Hey there, Fred. Good to see you.

79
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:58,885
Thanks for helping.
It'd be pretty hard on my own.

80
00:08:59,054 --> 00:09:01,717
No problem. This is Paul.

81
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:03,518
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Pleasure.

82
00:09:03,692 --> 00:09:06,991
Paul's father
is a business associate of mine.

83
00:09:07,563 --> 00:09:09,052
Thanks for helping.

84
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:13,028
No, the pleasure's all mine.
Not so much his.

85
00:09:13,201 --> 00:09:14,898
- Lucky, come on.
- Sorry, he's crazy.

86
00:09:15,072 --> 00:09:16,231
Stop it!

87
00:09:16,407 --> 00:09:19,706
- Hey! Come over here!
- Thank you, honey.

88
00:09:20,144 --> 00:09:21,634
So when did you get here?

89
00:09:21,812 --> 00:09:23,575
- Last week.
- You too?

90
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,009
- No.
- Yes.

91
00:09:25,182 --> 00:09:28,811
Well, they didn't get here till
the weekend. We got here on Friday.

92
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:32,581
Hi, Fred. Thanks for coming right over.

93
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,884
It's good to see you. How's Eve?

94
00:09:35,058 --> 00:09:36,584
Fine.

95
00:09:36,827 --> 00:09:39,318
- Hello.
- Pleasure to meet you, ma'am.

96
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:42,130
<i>- And where are the Keys?
- Got it?</i>

97
00:09:42,299 --> 00:09:44,529
<i>On the southern coast of Florida.</i>

98
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:47,061
<i>- Isn't it hotter down there?
- No.</i>

99
00:09:47,238 --> 00:09:48,226
Push.

100
00:09:48,407 --> 00:09:49,736
<i>It ain't all the time.</i>

101
00:09:50,607 --> 00:09:55,546
<i>Last year when I was in Miami
it rained cats and dogs the whole time.</i>

102
00:09:56,548 --> 00:10:00,451
<i>And you were up here and you were
swimming every day, remember?</i>

103
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:04,280
Still, it sucks that Jenny isn't here.
It's boring without...

104
00:10:04,456 --> 00:10:05,684
Careful.

105
00:10:05,857 --> 00:10:07,883
I am being careful.

106
00:10:08,059 --> 00:10:10,551
That was an expensive overhaul.

107
00:10:16,135 --> 00:10:18,797
See? Not a single scratch.

108
00:10:18,971 --> 00:10:22,032
Well, now you can help me
put up the boom.

109
00:10:23,908 --> 00:10:25,240
You got it?

110
00:10:25,911 --> 00:10:27,605
Yeah.

111
00:10:32,119 --> 00:10:34,644
- Put it down over there.
- Okay.

112
00:10:35,355 --> 00:10:37,653
But she told me
she'd be here the whole time.

113
00:10:37,857 --> 00:10:43,159
Yeah, well, I don't know either.
I don't know why she told you that.

114
00:10:44,298 --> 00:10:46,491
Maybe she went out with a friend.

115
00:10:46,932 --> 00:10:49,595
We'll ask her mother tomorrow
when we see her.

116
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:53,672
Anyway,
forecast for tomorrow is wind.

117
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:56,308
Why was Uncle Fred
behaving so strangely?

118
00:10:56,811 --> 00:10:57,971
Well, I'm not surprised.

119
00:10:58,145 --> 00:11:00,875
She got pretty worked up about it
last time.

120
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:08,380
Come on, just forget about it.
She's not gonna change.

121
00:11:09,524 --> 00:11:12,583
Yeah, well,
you're only gonna upset yourself.

122
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:15,787
Exactly. That's what I'm saying.

123
00:11:17,032 --> 00:11:20,798
Oh, they're great.
They're outside playing on the boat.

124
00:11:21,802 --> 00:11:22,793
Uh...

125
00:11:22,971 --> 00:11:24,802
I don't know, 5, 5:30.

126
00:11:24,972 --> 00:11:29,409
My kitchen clock's not working,
so I have to get that fixed on Monday.

127
00:11:32,815 --> 00:11:36,216
Yeah, exactly,
that's what I'm doing right now.

128
00:11:36,418 --> 00:11:38,317
We're having steak.

129
00:11:38,488 --> 00:11:42,446
It all defrosted,
so now I have to get rid of it.

130
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:44,524
You should come on out.

131
00:11:46,227 --> 00:11:48,287
Yeah, that was stupid of me.

132
00:11:48,465 --> 00:11:49,897
I froze 4 pounds of steak...

133
00:11:50,066 --> 00:11:53,899
...now I'm standing here
looking at half a cow.

134
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:58,700
I'm not joking. Come on out, please,
just for the weekend.

135
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:03,837
Well, tell him not to be so difficult.

136
00:12:04,179 --> 00:12:05,476
Hold on a second.

137
00:12:05,648 --> 00:12:08,081
- What is it, honey?
- We need a sharp knife.

138
00:12:08,251 --> 00:12:09,842
Okay.

139
00:12:12,688 --> 00:12:14,520
- I'd like to see it again.
- Okay.

140
00:12:14,691 --> 00:12:16,956
- Tell your father.
- Okay.

141
00:12:17,226 --> 00:12:19,751
So, what do you think?

142
00:12:21,097 --> 00:12:24,158
Well, tell your sweetheart
to bring his laptop with him.

143
00:12:24,335 --> 00:12:27,099
Jump in the car,
and you'll be here in an hour.

144
00:12:29,105 --> 00:12:32,200
Well, he shouldn't be so antisocial.

145
00:12:33,844 --> 00:12:37,575
Come on, we've got enough steak
for the whole week.

146
00:12:37,749 --> 00:12:40,182
What is it? Hold on. Okay.

147
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:43,947
All right. Well, listen, just call me
and let me know, all right?

148
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,918
Okay, all right, Nancy.

149
00:12:46,091 --> 00:12:47,615
- Bye.
- Bye.

150
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:50,125
What now, honey?

151
00:12:50,495 --> 00:12:53,588
- There's someone here.
- Where?

152
00:12:53,999 --> 00:12:55,932
At the door.

153
00:12:59,703 --> 00:13:01,229
- Hello.
- Hello.

154
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:05,775
Sorry to disturb you, I'm staying
next door. I saw you earlier at the gate.

155
00:13:05,943 --> 00:13:08,071
Oh, yeah, of course.

156
00:13:09,081 --> 00:13:11,105
Please, come in.

157
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:18,554
So how can I help you?

158
00:13:18,724 --> 00:13:20,658
Tell your dad we're eating
in 10 minutes.

159
00:13:20,826 --> 00:13:21,918
Okay.

160
00:13:22,094 --> 00:13:23,458
Well, Eve s...

161
00:13:23,629 --> 00:13:25,755
I mean, Mrs. Thompson sent me.

162
00:13:25,932 --> 00:13:30,028
She's cooking and she ran out of eggs
and asked if you could help her out.

163
00:13:31,038 --> 00:13:33,232
Of course. How many does she need?

164
00:13:33,405 --> 00:13:34,566
Four.

165
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:36,165
Four?

166
00:13:36,741 --> 00:13:37,835
What for?

167
00:13:38,044 --> 00:13:39,807
- Excuse me?
- What for?

168
00:13:39,979 --> 00:13:44,974
What does she need the eggs for?
I mean, what's she cooking?

169
00:13:45,318 --> 00:13:47,684
I have no idea.

170
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:53,948
So are they okay just like this
or do you need the carton?

171
00:13:54,126 --> 00:13:56,095
Whatever you want.

172
00:13:56,764 --> 00:13:58,594
How did you get in here?

173
00:13:58,765 --> 00:14:00,357
Down there.

174
00:14:00,567 --> 00:14:02,967
I mean, down by the water.

175
00:14:03,135 --> 00:14:04,967
But you're not wet.

176
00:14:05,139 --> 00:14:08,700
There's a hole in the fence.
By the water, not in the water.

177
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:13,437
Fred sh... I mean, Mr. Thompson,
knows about it. He showed it to me.

178
00:14:13,615 --> 00:14:16,139
Oh, I see.

179
00:14:16,683 --> 00:14:18,652
So you sure they're okay like this?

180
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,845
Yeah, yeah. That's okay. No problem.

181
00:14:21,022 --> 00:14:23,115
- Thank you very much. Thank you.
- All right.

182
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:26,658
Say hello to Eve. Tell her we're
looking forward to the game tomorrow.

183
00:14:26,828 --> 00:14:28,056
I'll tell her. Thanks again.

184
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:29,991
Thanks to Fred and your friend for help...

185
00:14:30,164 --> 00:14:32,597
- Shit.
- What happened?

186
00:14:40,308 --> 00:14:42,538
It's not a disaster.

187
00:15:00,229 --> 00:15:02,528
We have to go grocery shopping
on Monday anyway.

188
00:15:08,638 --> 00:15:10,730
I'm really sorry.

189
00:15:11,374 --> 00:15:15,744
It's not so bad. None of us eat eggs
for breakfast anyway.

190
00:15:18,782 --> 00:15:21,273
So the disaster's under control.

191
00:15:21,451 --> 00:15:24,580
Well, thank you. I'm sorry,
I should have paid more attention.

192
00:15:24,754 --> 00:15:27,451
Well, you shouldn't cry
over spilt milk, right?

193
00:15:27,624 --> 00:15:28,649
You're really nice.

194
00:15:29,326 --> 00:15:31,385
You do what you can.

195
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:36,721
I really am sorry.

196
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:43,738
I'm very clumsy, you know?
I think I have two left hands.

197
00:15:43,908 --> 00:15:47,866
- Then you're the man for carrying eggs.
- Yes, you could say that.

198
00:15:48,046 --> 00:15:51,743
So, what are we going to do now?

199
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:58,312
Well, we have a lot of steak,
but we might be expecting guests...

200
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:01,424
...and they definitely eat eggs
for breakfast.

201
00:16:01,592 --> 00:16:03,389
You'll still have four left.

202
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:06,157
It's a box with a dozen, isn't it?
Or am I mistaken?

203
00:16:06,331 --> 00:16:09,062
No, you're not mistaken.

204
00:16:17,909 --> 00:16:20,434
So would you like the carton this time?

205
00:16:20,613 --> 00:16:23,411
- It's not necessary.
- Are you sure?

206
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:25,676
But if you insist.

207
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:26,943
If I insist?

208
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,520
Well, it might be better, I guess.

209
00:16:36,928 --> 00:16:39,364
- Oh, God.
- What?

210
00:16:39,767 --> 00:16:40,857
Oh, no.

211
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:42,932
I'm sorry.

212
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,171
Before you destroy
the rest of the kitchen...

213
00:16:52,346 --> 00:16:54,677
...maybe you should take the eggs
and leave. All right?

214
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,509
Yes.

215
00:17:02,655 --> 00:17:04,317
No carton?

216
00:17:13,367 --> 00:17:16,234
I'm really sorry. Honestly.

217
00:17:16,403 --> 00:17:18,133
Me too.

218
00:17:19,173 --> 00:17:20,334
Here you go.

219
00:17:20,508 --> 00:17:22,567
Thank you very much. Thank you.

220
00:17:22,777 --> 00:17:24,903
I'll tell Mrs. Thompson
how nice you were.

221
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:26,411
Do what you have to do.

222
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,548
Have a nice day.

223
00:18:37,587 --> 00:18:39,452
Excuse me?

224
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:45,792
Lucky. Lucky. Get down.
Come on, come on, stop that.

225
00:18:45,962 --> 00:18:48,625
Get out of here. Go on, get lost.

226
00:18:49,933 --> 00:18:53,164
I'm sorry. He's completely harmless.
He just wants to play.

227
00:18:53,372 --> 00:18:55,499
That's a strange way to play.

228
00:18:55,673 --> 00:18:58,574
- Did he hurt you?
- Peter is afraid of dogs.

229
00:18:58,743 --> 00:19:00,507
Oh, I'm sorry.

230
00:19:00,678 --> 00:19:02,771
Me too. He jumped on me.

231
00:19:02,948 --> 00:19:05,508
- I'm really sorry.
- Yeah.

232
00:19:04,284 --> 00:19:07,684
- Should I lock him up so you can leave?
- That won't be necessary.

233
00:19:07,854 --> 00:19:10,378
- I can call my husband.
- It's not gonna be necessary.

234
00:19:10,557 --> 00:19:13,616
It's my fault.
I completely forgot about the dog.

235
00:19:13,794 --> 00:19:16,192
I should've come myself and...

236
00:19:17,263 --> 00:19:19,060
Wow.

237
00:19:19,766 --> 00:19:22,530
That's a really great set of clubs.

238
00:19:23,702 --> 00:19:26,001
It's Callaway, right?

239
00:19:27,074 --> 00:19:28,596
Awesome.

240
00:19:29,576 --> 00:19:32,910
These are wonderful. May I?

241
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:39,414
I guess we don't
stand a chance tomorrow, do we?

242
00:19:43,324 --> 00:19:45,724
The club doesn't make the player.

243
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:49,093
That's true.

244
00:19:49,565 --> 00:19:51,931
Would you mind if I tried this?

245
00:19:52,098 --> 00:19:54,761
Just once, please? Real quick.

246
00:19:54,936 --> 00:19:57,029
Outside. Please? Yes?

247
00:19:57,471 --> 00:20:00,236
I'll hit it towards the bay. Yes?

248
00:20:01,977 --> 00:20:04,240
If it makes you happy.

249
00:20:04,413 --> 00:20:05,903
Thank you.

250
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,182
Thanks a lot. Really.

251
00:20:13,355 --> 00:20:15,118
Thank you.

252
00:20:15,289 --> 00:20:16,916
Excuse me.

253
00:20:21,195 --> 00:20:24,096
He loves golf. We both do.

254
00:20:24,267 --> 00:20:27,862
- Excuse me?
- We both do. We both love golf.

255
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:34,502
Lucky!

256
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:41,875
Lucky. Be quiet.

257
00:20:47,691 --> 00:20:51,319
- What's the matter with him?
- I don't know.

258
00:20:51,494 --> 00:20:54,191
It's probably too hot for him too.

259
00:21:16,721 --> 00:21:18,551
I'll take a look.

260
00:21:42,515 --> 00:21:46,541
It's wonderful. It really
makes a difference, like night and day.

261
00:21:46,719 --> 00:21:48,743
Thanks a lot.

262
00:21:49,454 --> 00:21:50,922
Sure.

263
00:21:51,589 --> 00:21:52,682
Lucky!

264
00:21:52,857 --> 00:21:54,552
- Where's Tom?
- Who?

265
00:21:54,728 --> 00:21:56,694
Did you give him the eggs?

266
00:21:57,462 --> 00:21:59,260
Excuse me?

267
00:22:02,902 --> 00:22:06,770
Driver's really first class.
You have to try it.

268
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:10,136
Listen, young man, I don't know
what kind of game you're playing...

269
00:22:10,309 --> 00:22:12,574
...but I don't wanna be a part of it.

270
00:22:19,685 --> 00:22:21,414
Would you please leave now?

271
00:22:26,227 --> 00:22:28,057
What game?

272
00:22:28,762 --> 00:22:33,257
I'm sorry, ma'am, but I don't understand
why you're suddenly being so unfriendly.

273
00:22:33,432 --> 00:22:37,461
- Did Tom or I do anything to upset you?
- Please leave.

274
00:22:39,338 --> 00:22:42,207
Did you misbehave while I was outside?
Was he rude?

275
00:22:43,109 --> 00:22:45,477
- Did he say something that...?
- Stop it.

276
00:22:51,085 --> 00:22:55,453
I've asked you nicely to leave.
Now I'd like you to go.

277
00:22:56,624 --> 00:22:58,285
Well...

278
00:22:58,792 --> 00:23:03,628
I don't understand what's upset you,
but if you insist.

279
00:23:03,798 --> 00:23:07,461
Just give Tom the eggs,
and we won't bother you anymore.

280
00:23:08,269 --> 00:23:09,430
Excuse me?

281
00:23:09,605 --> 00:23:13,701
We'll have to tell Eve and Fred. Nothing
like this has happened to me before.

282
00:23:13,875 --> 00:23:15,776
What about you?

283
00:23:18,012 --> 00:23:21,471
- Can you just give us the eggs, please?
- No.

284
00:23:21,651 --> 00:23:23,515
How dare you.

285
00:23:25,253 --> 00:23:27,051
Please just go. Right now.

286
00:23:27,256 --> 00:23:29,281
Did I do something wrong?

287
00:23:29,459 --> 00:23:31,586
I asked you to leave. I want you to go.

288
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,320
Have you seen the dog? Is he with you?

289
00:23:34,497 --> 00:23:37,397
- Will you throw them out?
- It's good you're here, Mr. Farber.

290
00:23:37,567 --> 00:23:39,830
- That's your name, isn't it? Farber?
- Yes.

291
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:42,631
Yeah, Fre... Mr. Thompson told us.

292
00:23:42,806 --> 00:23:44,705
- What's going on?
- I want them to leave.

293
00:23:44,874 --> 00:23:47,865
Your wife's under the wrong impression.
I'm happy you're here.

294
00:23:48,044 --> 00:23:50,535
I'm certain you can
figure out this misunderstanding.

295
00:23:50,713 --> 00:23:53,547
- George, please.
- Dad, I can't...

296
00:23:53,917 --> 00:23:55,749
Just go. Please, go.

297
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,047
Hey, Ann.

298
00:23:58,689 --> 00:24:01,419
This is ridiculous. I can't believe this.

299
00:24:01,592 --> 00:24:03,821
- Honey, do you mind?
- No, he's fine.

300
00:24:03,993 --> 00:24:06,359
- May I please explain what happened?
- Please do.

301
00:24:06,529 --> 00:24:09,828
Mrs. Thompson sent me over
to ask for some eggs, and then...

302
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,992
Your wife gave Peter the eggs,
but, unfortunately, they broke.

303
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:15,105
And then she gave me
another four eggs...

304
00:24:15,306 --> 00:24:17,797
...but the dog jumped on me,
and now...

305
00:24:18,608 --> 00:24:21,578
You had a dozen and you're going
shopping on Monday anyway.

306
00:24:21,746 --> 00:24:24,373
We just want the eggs, that's all.

307
00:24:24,548 --> 00:24:27,311
Ann, can you tell me
what's going on here?

308
00:24:30,622 --> 00:24:34,250
Honey, can you just tell
me what's going on?

309
00:24:35,727 --> 00:24:37,319
Just give them to them.

310
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:40,356
- Can I have them now?
- Hold on a moment.

311
00:24:40,531 --> 00:24:43,467
Ann, if it's just about some eggs,
why are you so angry?

312
00:24:43,635 --> 00:24:46,036
Look, I'm not going
to justify myself in front...

313
00:24:46,371 --> 00:24:50,604
I asked you to throw them out.
Maybe I have my reasons.

314
00:24:53,846 --> 00:24:56,279
Do what you want. I've had enough.

315
00:24:56,449 --> 00:24:58,040
Ann.

316
00:25:01,988 --> 00:25:03,750
I'm sorry.

317
00:25:04,457 --> 00:25:06,721
My wife's not feeling well, so...

318
00:25:06,893 --> 00:25:08,554
Yeah.

319
00:25:09,127 --> 00:25:11,096
Could you please leave?

320
00:25:12,065 --> 00:25:15,760
I can hardly play the mediator
if I don't know the facts, now, can I?

321
00:25:15,935 --> 00:25:19,929
So could you just leave, please?

322
00:25:25,612 --> 00:25:26,874
Please, the...

323
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,071
- What?
- Just give them to him.

324
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:34,510
- What the hell is going on here?
- Nothing's going on, sir.

325
00:25:34,688 --> 00:25:37,817
He asked for the eggs,
the dog attacked him, they broke.

326
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:42,019
Now he would like some more.
What is so difficult to understand?

327
00:25:42,194 --> 00:25:45,188
You better watch your tone,
young man.

328
00:25:45,767 --> 00:25:50,897
You better be careful, old man,
or I'll break your eggs.

329
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:56,442
Now, please leave, right now.

330
00:25:56,611 --> 00:25:58,044
- Mr. Farber?
- What?

331
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,642
Dad!

332
00:26:00,815 --> 00:26:02,509
Is it broken?

333
00:26:03,786 --> 00:26:05,913
Hey, hey, come on, come on,
come on.

334
00:26:06,487 --> 00:26:09,854
Hey. Come on. Behave yourself.

335
00:26:10,925 --> 00:26:12,654
Behave yourself, okay?

336
00:26:12,826 --> 00:26:15,317
Okay? I don't want to hurt you...

337
00:26:16,163 --> 00:26:18,826
...so you have to behave yourself.

338
00:26:22,837 --> 00:26:24,897
- Mom.
- What is it, baby?

339
00:26:25,074 --> 00:26:27,337
Please, just, ma'am,
stay where you are, okay?

340
00:26:28,009 --> 00:26:30,000
Please, stay.

341
00:26:31,948 --> 00:26:35,473
- He slapped me in the face.
- Yeah, he started it.

342
00:26:36,352 --> 00:26:40,756
You can help him,
just don't do anything stupid. Help him.

343
00:26:47,096 --> 00:26:49,497
- You should bring him a chair.
- What happened?

344
00:26:49,665 --> 00:26:50,758
It's my knee.

345
00:26:50,968 --> 00:26:54,027
You should take off his pants.
He should sit. Bring him a chair.

346
00:26:54,203 --> 00:26:56,332
Go get him a chair, honey.

347
00:26:57,906 --> 00:26:59,464
Be careful.

348
00:26:59,777 --> 00:27:03,711
Peter is a... He's a medical student.
He can help you with it.

349
00:27:05,781 --> 00:27:08,115
Can you please take off your pants?

350
00:27:09,118 --> 00:27:11,713
If you don't let me see
your wound, I can't help you.

351
00:27:11,888 --> 00:27:14,857
I'm sorry I hurt you,
but you forced me to, you must admit.

352
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:19,923
Come on, Mr. Farber,
be reasonable. Let him look at your leg.

353
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:22,066
He can help you with it.

354
00:27:24,701 --> 00:27:26,603
Would you please...

355
00:27:28,306 --> 00:27:30,102
...leave?

356
00:27:30,275 --> 00:27:31,740
Please.

357
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:34,275
We won't get anywhere like this.

358
00:27:38,416 --> 00:27:41,875
You have to let him help you,
you don't really have a choice.

359
00:27:42,054 --> 00:27:43,988
You're the ship's captain, sir.

360
00:27:44,155 --> 00:27:49,526
You're aware that onboard,
the captain's word is law, aren't you?

361
00:27:50,228 --> 00:27:52,322
So, what do you want to do?

362
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:55,095
You want to call someone?

363
00:27:55,267 --> 00:27:58,259
An ambulance or the police?

364
00:27:58,904 --> 00:28:00,429
I won't stop you.

365
00:28:00,771 --> 00:28:03,673
Neither will Tom. Right, Tom?

366
00:28:08,548 --> 00:28:10,606
Well, what are you waiting for?

367
00:28:13,419 --> 00:28:16,411
He dropped the cell phone in the sink.

368
00:28:22,627 --> 00:28:26,086
- Why are you doing this?
- Why not?

369
00:28:27,067 --> 00:28:29,432
Okay, let's play another game.

370
00:28:30,436 --> 00:28:32,564
It's a guessing game.

371
00:28:36,143 --> 00:28:38,077
What is this?

372
00:28:47,887 --> 00:28:49,515
Sir?

373
00:28:55,896 --> 00:28:57,728
It's a golf ball.

374
00:28:58,232 --> 00:29:01,395
Correct. It's a golf ball.

375
00:29:01,836 --> 00:29:04,737
But why do I have it in my pocket?

376
00:29:05,373 --> 00:29:08,240
Hm? The lady knows why.

377
00:29:08,675 --> 00:29:10,233
Because?

378
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,107
Well?

379
00:29:18,987 --> 00:29:20,114
Well?

380
00:29:23,057 --> 00:29:24,820
Because you didn't hit it.

381
00:29:25,126 --> 00:29:29,153
Correct. Because I didn't hit it.
And why didn't I hit it?

382
00:29:29,698 --> 00:29:32,496
Because something stopped you.

383
00:29:32,667 --> 00:29:37,502
Correct. Because I had
to test the club in another way.

384
00:29:47,584 --> 00:29:49,210
Where is he?

385
00:29:49,885 --> 00:29:51,250
Cold.

386
00:29:57,227 --> 00:29:59,023
Even colder.

387
00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:06,227
Cold.

388
00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:08,864
Ice cold.

389
00:30:17,314 --> 00:30:19,112
Warmer.

390
00:30:21,085 --> 00:30:22,779
Warmer.

391
00:30:22,953 --> 00:30:24,785
Little cold.

392
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:29,457
Warmer.

393
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,557
Warmer.

394
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:35,632
Warmer.

395
00:30:38,604 --> 00:30:40,230
Cold.

396
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:44,903
Cold.

397
00:30:46,612 --> 00:30:48,409
Warmer.

398
00:30:49,146 --> 00:30:51,708
Warm, cold.

399
00:30:54,752 --> 00:30:56,448
Warmer.

400
00:30:56,989 --> 00:30:58,980
Really warm.

401
00:31:19,045 --> 00:31:22,378
Would you please go to the kitchen
and get me something to eat?

402
00:31:23,282 --> 00:31:25,275
That be possible?

403
00:31:37,865 --> 00:31:40,560
Maybe there's some bananas or...

404
00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:46,671
Please don't think about bringing back
a knife or anything like that...

405
00:31:46,839 --> 00:31:48,740
...or I'd be sorry.

406
00:31:48,909 --> 00:31:51,173
For you, I mean.

407
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:01,547
It's getting cloudy.

408
00:32:07,095 --> 00:32:09,221
That's very nice of you, thank you.

409
00:32:09,396 --> 00:32:10,886
Hello?

410
00:32:11,298 --> 00:32:13,028
Hello?

411
00:32:13,667 --> 00:32:14,999
Hello?

412
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:17,229
Hello?

413
00:32:20,208 --> 00:32:21,731
Yeah!

414
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:23,568
Hello!

415
00:32:24,179 --> 00:32:26,511
Hi, sweetie.

416
00:32:34,623 --> 00:32:36,385
Where are you?

417
00:32:37,859 --> 00:32:40,420
Come on down to the water.

418
00:32:43,432 --> 00:32:46,424
We're both thinking the same thing,
aren't we?

419
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:49,494
Hm?

420
00:32:57,346 --> 00:32:59,472
We saw your boat.

421
00:33:00,282 --> 00:33:01,875
Hi, Betsy.

422
00:33:02,118 --> 00:33:04,109
Hi, Robert.

423
00:33:05,355 --> 00:33:07,481
When did you get here?

424
00:33:07,656 --> 00:33:09,284
Today.

425
00:33:09,894 --> 00:33:12,055
We're still unpacking.

426
00:33:12,996 --> 00:33:15,088
How long you staying?

427
00:33:16,099 --> 00:33:18,828
Probably a week or two.
We're not sure yet.

428
00:33:19,002 --> 00:33:22,494
Oh, wonderful. So nice to see you.

429
00:33:24,107 --> 00:33:26,941
- Let me help you.
- Thank you.

430
00:33:27,511 --> 00:33:30,503
- Have you ever met my sister-in-law?
- No.

431
00:33:30,681 --> 00:33:32,740
Pleased to meet you.

432
00:33:32,916 --> 00:33:35,613
Hello, nice to meet you too.

433
00:33:35,787 --> 00:33:37,846
Hello. Hi, Robert.

434
00:33:38,022 --> 00:33:39,955
- Hi, how are you?
- Fine.

435
00:33:41,826 --> 00:33:45,523
This is Paul. He's staying
with the Thompsons next door.

436
00:33:45,695 --> 00:33:48,756
- Hi, pleased to meet you.
- Hi, Paul. You cold?

437
00:33:48,933 --> 00:33:52,961
- Oh, no, I have... I have eczema.
- Oh.

438
00:33:53,137 --> 00:33:56,130
You should go swimming,
the water works wonders for that here.

439
00:33:56,307 --> 00:33:58,333
Thank you, that's good advice.

440
00:33:59,044 --> 00:34:00,807
- Hello, pleased to meet you.
- Hello.

441
00:34:00,979 --> 00:34:02,038
How's George?

442
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,675
Fine, thanks.

443
00:34:04,849 --> 00:34:06,182
Where is he?

444
00:34:06,351 --> 00:34:11,619
He pulled a muscle putting up the mast,
so he's lying down, resting.

445
00:34:11,789 --> 00:34:15,226
So sorry to hear that. That's what
happens when you try to do too much.

446
00:34:15,427 --> 00:34:18,521
Robert, on the other hand,
would never dream of launching a boat.

447
00:34:18,697 --> 00:34:20,358
Right, Robert?

448
00:34:21,134 --> 00:34:23,967
Tell your hubby to get better,
we're grilling every night.

449
00:34:24,137 --> 00:34:25,228
I'll tell him.

450
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:29,135
I mean it, as soon as he's better,
swing by. Robert's son is here.

451
00:34:29,309 --> 00:34:32,072
He brought his little girlfriend.
He'd like her for sure.

452
00:34:32,246 --> 00:34:35,009
All right. Well, listen,
it's great to see you, darling.

453
00:34:35,215 --> 00:34:38,913
Listen, if the weather stays like this,
you'll probably have to take the car.

454
00:34:39,085 --> 00:34:41,143
- It's supposed to be windy.
- For tomorrow...

455
00:34:41,322 --> 00:34:44,018
- Where's your dock?
- Excuse me?

456
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:46,021
Your dock?

457
00:34:46,192 --> 00:34:49,492
Oh, it's just around the peninsula,
but on the other side.

458
00:34:49,663 --> 00:34:52,028
The old cottage, with the red dock?

459
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:53,927
Right.

460
00:34:54,101 --> 00:34:55,362
It's very beautiful.

461
00:34:55,536 --> 00:34:57,663
Well, thank you, we enjoy it.

462
00:34:58,606 --> 00:35:02,166
Well, anyway, it's good to see you.
All right, goodbye.

463
00:35:08,782 --> 00:35:11,581
So you're here all week?

464
00:35:11,753 --> 00:35:13,617
Well, this week for sure.

465
00:35:13,889 --> 00:35:15,219
Maybe we'll come by tonight.

466
00:35:15,389 --> 00:35:17,380
Oh, do, you know we love seeing you.

467
00:35:17,559 --> 00:35:20,221
All right.
We'll see how George is doing.

468
00:35:20,394 --> 00:35:22,420
Yeah, see how he is.

469
00:35:22,597 --> 00:35:23,791
Bye-bye.

470
00:35:23,998 --> 00:35:26,025
- Bye.
- Bye.

471
00:35:28,436 --> 00:35:30,427
They'll be here in two hours...

472
00:35:30,606 --> 00:35:33,199
...and then this little charade of yours
will be over.

473
00:35:33,375 --> 00:35:35,036
Sorry, but that's not exactly true.

474
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:37,577
Didn't you ask your friends to call
and confirm...

475
00:35:37,746 --> 00:35:39,543
...or did I misunderstand something?

476
00:35:39,715 --> 00:35:43,115
They'll come,
even if they can't reach us.

477
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,581
Is lying allowed?

478
00:35:45,755 --> 00:35:49,246
Just a second.
Wait, let me move this out of the way.

479
00:35:49,759 --> 00:35:54,163
Why don't you have a landline?
Don't you find it convenient?

480
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:57,130
Or is it
that you aren't out here that much?

481
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,963
Please, have a seat.

482
00:36:00,135 --> 00:36:03,333
You know you can be completely
open with us. You'd feel better.

483
00:36:03,539 --> 00:36:05,940
We're being completely open with you.

484
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:08,804
Right there.

485
00:36:15,085 --> 00:36:16,746
You should put a pillow under him.

486
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:20,150
You know, if you'd let Peter
help you, it would hurt less.

487
00:36:20,324 --> 00:36:22,985
I'm happy to help, really,
I just don't want to impose.

488
00:36:23,161 --> 00:36:24,956
Careful with...

489
00:36:25,762 --> 00:36:30,324
That's a good idea, put it up.
That should be more comfortable.

490
00:36:31,168 --> 00:36:33,967
So there we are.

491
00:36:34,505 --> 00:36:38,065
- You sure you don't wanna put a pillow...?
- Could you please stop this?

492
00:36:39,643 --> 00:36:41,804
You're asking?

493
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,639
What?

494
00:36:43,815 --> 00:36:45,010
You said, "Please."

495
00:36:55,094 --> 00:36:57,119
I'm very happy about this.

496
00:36:57,963 --> 00:37:00,329
It's easier when things are polite.

497
00:37:01,967 --> 00:37:04,867
I'd like to apologize for before.

498
00:37:05,471 --> 00:37:09,804
But you have to admit, George,
the slap in the face?

499
00:37:10,208 --> 00:37:13,371
It really wasn't
the most appropriate reaction.

500
00:37:20,018 --> 00:37:21,612
I'm Paul.

501
00:37:23,155 --> 00:37:25,123
This is Peter.

502
00:37:25,557 --> 00:37:29,253
Come here, Tom. Where are
your manners? Shake the man's hand.

503
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:36,197
Here, take this for the pain.

504
00:37:36,369 --> 00:37:38,599
What's this now?
What, are we shit to you?

505
00:37:40,139 --> 00:37:42,199
What, didn't we just agree that?

506
00:37:43,777 --> 00:37:45,768
Jesus Christ!

507
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:57,887
It's okay. It's okay.

508
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:01,353
Stop it now,
otherwise your mother will get hurt.

509
00:38:01,528 --> 00:38:03,724
Stop it! Do you understand?
Do you understand?!

510
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,925
Calm down.

511
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:12,197
Calm down.

512
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:25,409
So much stress for politeness' sake.

513
00:38:40,503 --> 00:38:42,971
I mean, I was just trying to be friendly.

514
00:38:43,405 --> 00:38:46,168
Improve relations.
I thought we could keep this civilized.

515
00:38:46,342 --> 00:38:47,831
Why are you doing this?

516
00:38:52,981 --> 00:38:54,449
Tubby, why are we doing this?

517
00:38:56,586 --> 00:38:58,315
Go on, say it.

518
00:38:59,755 --> 00:39:01,086
I don't know.

519
00:39:02,592 --> 00:39:04,856
The captain would like to know why.

520
00:39:05,795 --> 00:39:07,353
Well?

521
00:39:08,797 --> 00:39:10,527
It's difficult to talk about it.

522
00:39:10,733 --> 00:39:12,666
Don't be shy.

523
00:39:13,469 --> 00:39:16,438
You know exactly how hard
this is for me.

524
00:39:16,974 --> 00:39:18,668
Jesus, what a drama.

525
00:39:18,842 --> 00:39:23,108
His father divorced his mother when
he was this big, for another woman...

526
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,612
It's not true! He's lying.

527
00:39:26,784 --> 00:39:29,115
My mother got a divorce because...

528
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:33,347
Because she wanted her
little teddy bear all to herself.

529
00:39:33,525 --> 00:39:36,981
Which is why he's gay,
and he's a criminal, got it?

530
00:39:37,161 --> 00:39:39,025
You're an asshole.

531
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:40,891
The truth is...

532
00:39:41,065 --> 00:39:45,364
...he's white trash. He comes
from a filthy, deprived family.

533
00:39:45,536 --> 00:39:47,800
Five siblings, all of them on drugs.

534
00:39:47,972 --> 00:39:49,802
His father is an alcoholic.

535
00:39:49,974 --> 00:39:54,070
His mother, well, I mean,
you can imagine.

536
00:39:54,679 --> 00:39:56,306
Truth is...

537
00:39:57,282 --> 00:39:58,840
...he's fucking her.

538
00:40:00,217 --> 00:40:02,483
It's sad, but it's true.

539
00:40:03,389 --> 00:40:06,916
Come on. Calm down now, Tubby.

540
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:09,657
Stop it.

541
00:40:10,396 --> 00:40:12,659
You're disgusting.

542
00:40:12,831 --> 00:40:16,097
Can't you at least watch your language
in front of my son?

543
00:40:16,735 --> 00:40:18,032
Oh, I'm...

544
00:40:18,204 --> 00:40:19,534
I'm sorry.

545
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:21,672
Of course.

546
00:40:22,007 --> 00:40:25,032
What would you like to hear?
What would make you happy?

547
00:40:25,844 --> 00:40:29,110
None of what I said is true,
you know that as well as I do.

548
00:40:29,315 --> 00:40:31,179
You think he's white trash?

549
00:40:32,219 --> 00:40:34,813
Come on, he's a spoiled little brat.

550
00:40:35,722 --> 00:40:41,251
He's jaded and disgusted
by the emptiness of existence.

551
00:40:42,262 --> 00:40:43,820
It's hard.

552
00:40:44,597 --> 00:40:46,226
Really.

553
00:40:50,269 --> 00:40:54,262
He liked that. Look, now he's smiling.

554
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:58,235
Okay?

555
00:40:59,045 --> 00:41:02,413
You happy now,
or you want another version?

556
00:41:12,592 --> 00:41:13,992
I'm hungry.

557
00:41:15,128 --> 00:41:16,960
Let's see what there is.

558
00:41:18,231 --> 00:41:19,597
Truth is...

559
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:21,630
...he's a drug addict.

560
00:41:21,802 --> 00:41:24,293
That's where he's going to right now.

561
00:41:26,141 --> 00:41:29,007
That's why he's so nervous.
I'm also a drug addict.

562
00:41:29,175 --> 00:41:34,512
We rob rich families in their charming
vacation homes to support our habit.

563
00:41:34,682 --> 00:41:37,777
Stop this bullshit.

564
00:41:38,755 --> 00:41:42,385
- I get it. Isn't that enough?
- That's good.

565
00:41:43,893 --> 00:41:47,726
Hey, Tubby, he's got it.
He gets it.

566
00:41:49,699 --> 00:41:52,760
That's awesome, really.
Really. Listen...

567
00:41:52,936 --> 00:41:54,697
Peter, come here.

568
00:41:55,239 --> 00:41:57,605
Listen, we're gonna
make a bet now, okay?

569
00:41:58,242 --> 00:42:00,369
Come on, hurry up.

570
00:42:01,545 --> 00:42:03,775
- Sit down.
- It's dark in here.

571
00:42:03,947 --> 00:42:06,074
Come on, don't fall asleep.

572
00:42:07,117 --> 00:42:09,746
Okay, we bet... What time is it?

573
00:42:10,454 --> 00:42:12,114
Eight-forty.

574
00:42:13,458 --> 00:42:16,949
that in, let's say, 12 hours...

575
00:42:17,927 --> 00:42:19,396
...all three of you...

576
00:42:19,731 --> 00:42:22,893
...are gonna be kaput.

577
00:42:23,068 --> 00:42:24,659
Okay?

578
00:42:27,771 --> 00:42:29,295
What?

579
00:42:29,474 --> 00:42:32,237
You bet that you'll be
alive tomorrow at 9:00...

580
00:42:32,409 --> 00:42:35,436
...and we bet
that you'll be dead, okay?

581
00:42:51,197 --> 00:42:52,663
They don't wanna bet.

582
00:42:52,831 --> 00:42:55,630
Well, it's not an option.
There has to be a bet.

583
00:42:56,101 --> 00:42:59,128
I mean, what do you think?
You think they stand a chance?

584
00:42:59,304 --> 00:43:02,934
You're on their side, aren't you?
Who are you betting on, hm?

585
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:05,804
But, wait, what kind of bet is this?
If they're dead...

586
00:43:05,978 --> 00:43:09,971
...they can't live up to their side,
and if they win, they can't live, either.

587
00:43:10,617 --> 00:43:13,141
Yes, they'll lose either way,
that's what I'm saying.

588
00:43:13,318 --> 00:43:15,686
Stop this nonsense.
Are you trying to scare us?

589
00:43:18,525 --> 00:43:20,288
Haven't you done enough already?

590
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:23,724
What do you want? You want money?
Well, take it. I'll tell you what.

591
00:43:23,896 --> 00:43:26,023
Take what you want, just get out.

592
00:43:26,632 --> 00:43:28,190
Okay?

593
00:43:30,737 --> 00:43:34,833
Don't you think Fred and Eve are going
to come over and see what's happening?

594
00:43:36,210 --> 00:43:39,202
And then they're gonna give us
a thorough spanking, right?

595
00:43:43,916 --> 00:43:45,146
Okay.

596
00:43:45,318 --> 00:43:47,981
So the bet is on.

597
00:43:48,922 --> 00:43:51,152
Like they say on TV:

598
00:43:51,692 --> 00:43:53,181
Let's make a deal.

599
00:43:55,730 --> 00:43:57,891
So, what do you want to do now?

600
00:43:59,567 --> 00:44:03,333
Would you be so kind as to go
and make us something to eat?

601
00:44:04,505 --> 00:44:05,632
Tubby...

602
00:44:06,909 --> 00:44:09,434
...I'm worried about you.
Can you control yourself?

603
00:44:09,643 --> 00:44:12,340
You just finished stuffing your face
with that meat.

604
00:44:12,648 --> 00:44:15,208
It's disgusting.
What are these people going to think?

605
00:44:15,384 --> 00:44:18,842
I haven't had anything since noon.
Stop calling me "Tubby" all the time.

606
00:44:19,021 --> 00:44:20,385
- Okay, Tom.
- Okay, Jerry.

607
00:44:20,556 --> 00:44:24,253
Okay, well,
I think you should watch your figure.

608
00:44:24,425 --> 00:44:26,791
Do you think that that's attractive?

609
00:44:28,896 --> 00:44:32,425
Look at the captain's wife.
You think she thinks you're hot?

610
00:44:32,601 --> 00:44:33,898
- With these jelly rolls?
- Stop it.

611
00:44:35,237 --> 00:44:37,103
- Do you like having that?
- Stop it.

612
00:44:37,271 --> 00:44:39,240
Look at her, she's not that old.

613
00:44:41,476 --> 00:44:45,936
Pardon me, ma'am. You would be
completely acceptable to her...

614
00:44:46,682 --> 00:44:48,981
...if it wasn't for that body.

615
00:44:50,221 --> 00:44:51,983
You should follow her lead.

616
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:56,385
Now, that is a well-toned body.

617
00:44:57,393 --> 00:44:59,918
There's not an extra calorie on it.

618
00:45:00,096 --> 00:45:01,563
I'm not so sure.

619
00:45:01,965 --> 00:45:03,228
What?

620
00:45:03,733 --> 00:45:05,132
Did you hear that?

621
00:45:05,768 --> 00:45:10,034
Tubby, that's really rude.
Are we gonna take that, ma'am?

622
00:45:11,976 --> 00:45:14,307
- Oh, no.
- Hey.

623
00:45:14,478 --> 00:45:16,945
Indian. You.

624
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:20,911
What's your name anyway?

625
00:45:26,423 --> 00:45:28,219
George.

626
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:31,594
George? Just like Daddy.

627
00:45:33,097 --> 00:45:34,929
That's really sweet.

628
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:36,989
Come here, Georgie.

629
00:45:37,168 --> 00:45:38,327
Come here.

630
00:45:39,838 --> 00:45:41,465
Come here.

631
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:44,764
Come on,
we're gonna play a game now.

632
00:45:45,244 --> 00:45:46,869
Leave him alone.

633
00:45:47,045 --> 00:45:50,481
I know you don't want to play with me,
but it's a really awesome game.

634
00:45:50,650 --> 00:45:53,048
- It's a fun game, trust me.
- Leave the boy alone.

635
00:45:53,818 --> 00:45:56,253
You see how your mom fights for you?

636
00:45:56,454 --> 00:45:59,150
- Your daddy could learn from her.
- Stop it.

637
00:45:59,324 --> 00:46:01,452
That's why
we're gonna let her play too.

638
00:46:01,626 --> 00:46:03,958
Tubby, take Georgie for a second.

639
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:08,692
You see, this is an awesome game.
It's called Cat in a Bag.

640
00:46:08,867 --> 00:46:11,632
It's really fun. Here we go.

641
00:46:12,405 --> 00:46:15,806
Don't panic. Nothing's going to happen.
I said it was a fun game.

642
00:46:15,976 --> 00:46:20,673
It's a family game. Daddy can play, too,
so he doesn't get bored.

643
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:25,646
Hey, Georgie. It's no fun
if you keep moving around, okay?

644
00:46:25,818 --> 00:46:28,083
Hey! Listen to me.

645
00:46:30,157 --> 00:46:31,987
That's better.

646
00:46:34,795 --> 00:46:39,061
Now, listen, we're a team now,
aren't we?

647
00:46:43,036 --> 00:46:45,231
Does the cover bother you?

648
00:46:46,106 --> 00:46:48,302
Are you getting enough air?

649
00:46:49,208 --> 00:46:50,802
Are you?

650
00:46:51,744 --> 00:46:54,612
- Georgie? Are you?
- Yes.

651
00:46:54,815 --> 00:46:56,510
Awesome.

652
00:46:57,351 --> 00:46:58,751
Now we can start.

653
00:46:59,853 --> 00:47:03,847
If I remember correctly, Mommy
and our little Indian wanted to sneak off.

654
00:47:04,025 --> 00:47:07,222
Now, why was that?
Tubby, why was that?

655
00:47:07,961 --> 00:47:09,260
I don't know.

656
00:47:09,864 --> 00:47:13,630
Is lying allowed? What kind of
example are you setting for these people?

657
00:47:13,835 --> 00:47:16,771
Tubby, you know exactly
why she wanted to leave.

658
00:47:17,338 --> 00:47:20,137
Because you started talking
about her jelly rolls.

659
00:47:20,976 --> 00:47:24,536
You're the one
who's doubted her perfection.

660
00:47:25,347 --> 00:47:28,373
Whatever, it doesn't matter.
Anyway...

661
00:47:29,952 --> 00:47:34,117
...I understand why she was
embarrassed in front of the boy here.

662
00:47:34,757 --> 00:47:37,554
That's why we're playing
Cat in the Bag.

663
00:47:37,726 --> 00:47:40,559
To preserve moral decency.

664
00:47:40,797 --> 00:47:43,264
Now the kid is in the bag.

665
00:47:43,967 --> 00:47:47,458
Now let's see if Mommy's titties sag.

666
00:47:54,543 --> 00:47:56,670
We don't want to hurt
the kitty-cat, right?

667
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,403
Leave him alone.

668
00:47:58,581 --> 00:48:00,275
Exactly. Daddy would like to play too.

669
00:48:01,818 --> 00:48:03,376
Oh, God.

670
00:48:06,155 --> 00:48:07,487
What are we waiting for?

671
00:48:08,592 --> 00:48:10,492
Tell your wife not to be shy.

672
00:48:10,661 --> 00:48:14,619
It's silly.
I'm sure she doesn't have jelly rolls.

673
00:48:16,666 --> 00:48:18,601
Please, leave him alone.

674
00:48:19,436 --> 00:48:22,998
You just have to tell her
to take off her clothes.

675
00:48:23,606 --> 00:48:24,766
Please.

676
00:48:26,043 --> 00:48:28,409
"Take off your clothes, honey."

677
00:48:47,132 --> 00:48:49,224
Take off your clothes.

678
00:48:50,668 --> 00:48:54,126
"Take off your clothes, honey."

679
00:49:07,719 --> 00:49:10,380
Take off your clothes, honey.

680
00:50:47,289 --> 00:50:48,985
Bravo.

681
00:50:51,094 --> 00:50:54,994
What did I say? No jelly rolls.

682
00:50:55,565 --> 00:50:58,864
And now we can get dressed again.
Thank you.

683
00:51:27,097 --> 00:51:29,362
Gross. Tubby, come here.
Take this piglet.

684
00:51:29,532 --> 00:51:31,525
He's not even house broken yet.

685
00:51:31,702 --> 00:51:33,693
- Go change his diaper.
- I'll take him.

686
00:51:33,871 --> 00:51:36,635
It's okay,
I'm not doing anything to him.

687
00:51:37,541 --> 00:51:38,802
Let go of him!

688
00:52:36,869 --> 00:52:38,201
Here.

689
00:52:38,371 --> 00:52:39,668
Have a seat.

690
00:52:40,539 --> 00:52:42,565
Have a seat.

691
00:52:46,213 --> 00:52:48,681
I would advise you not to kick.

692
00:53:04,565 --> 00:53:06,760
I hope you don't get bored with him.

693
00:53:08,503 --> 00:53:12,632
If you do,
dump a bucket of water on his head.

694
00:53:15,643 --> 00:53:18,476
But be careful, don't ruin the carpet.

695
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:47,840
No, it's just a joke.

696
00:53:48,043 --> 00:53:50,137
I have to take my SATs again
in the fall...

697
00:53:50,311 --> 00:53:53,280
...and then I'll go to college
and study business.

698
00:53:59,121 --> 00:54:00,987
Does it hurt badly?

699
00:54:02,056 --> 00:54:04,081
Why don't you just kill us?

700
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:06,320
You shouldn't forget the importance
of entertainment.

701
00:54:52,610 --> 00:54:56,911
I'm sorry about the leg, but it's
really your own fault, if I may say so.

702
00:54:57,081 --> 00:54:59,710
I mean, why did you slap Paul?

703
00:55:00,518 --> 00:55:04,010
And the pointless begging for the eggs
was pretty uncomfortable for me.

704
00:55:04,188 --> 00:55:05,416
Degrading, actually.

705
00:55:05,590 --> 00:55:07,422
I don't know if that's clear to you.

706
00:55:07,726 --> 00:55:11,456
If you think about it, all of this,
just for a carton of eggs.

707
00:55:12,197 --> 00:55:14,632
In fact, they must still be there.

708
00:55:17,936 --> 00:55:20,130
Besides, you should've
listened to your wife.

709
00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:23,103
She practically begged you
to let us leave with the eggs.

710
00:55:23,275 --> 00:55:26,643
But then, of course,
everyone's always smarter in hindsight.

711
00:55:27,213 --> 00:55:28,907
Here they are.

712
00:55:29,481 --> 00:55:32,041
One is cracked, but not bad.

713
00:55:32,217 --> 00:55:35,550
These egg cartons can really
take a lot, considering.

714
00:55:36,755 --> 00:55:39,987
Why are you doing that?
How stupid do you think I am?

715
00:55:40,159 --> 00:55:42,150
I don't understand,
what are you thinking?

716
00:55:42,362 --> 00:55:45,092
You're practically forcing me
to treat you badly.

717
00:55:49,568 --> 00:55:52,402
Shit! Now you've really done it.

718
00:55:52,572 --> 00:55:55,474
And Paul specifically told us
to be careful with the carpet.

719
00:55:59,914 --> 00:56:02,313
Please, just let us go.

720
00:56:06,186 --> 00:56:10,885
Look, you have everything
ahead of you, you're still so young.

721
00:56:13,159 --> 00:56:14,820
Nothing's really happened yet.

722
00:56:14,996 --> 00:56:18,487
We can just say George's leg
broke on the boat.

723
00:56:20,199 --> 00:56:22,192
Everyone will believe us,
I promise you.

724
00:56:22,403 --> 00:56:24,702
- Please, don't do this.
- Please, just...

725
00:56:24,905 --> 00:56:29,969
Why are you degrading yourself?
This is as painful for me as it is for you.

726
00:57:03,679 --> 00:57:04,942
Georgie?

727
00:57:06,514 --> 00:57:08,505
Where are you?

728
00:58:38,610 --> 00:58:39,942
Georgie.

729
00:58:40,579 --> 00:58:42,570
I'm coming.

730
00:59:38,507 --> 00:59:42,534
Wait a second.
I'm gonna play a little music for us.

731
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:15,335
- Hi, Georgie.
- Don't come any closer.

732
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,146
Cock it.

733
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:22,880
Pull the handle back.

734
01:00:52,382 --> 01:00:54,179
Pull the trigger.

735
01:01:11,902 --> 01:01:15,704
<i>...instead,
urged compromise and said emotions...</i>

736
01:01:16,074 --> 01:01:18,338
<i>- to the museum.
- Oh.</i>

737
01:01:18,509 --> 01:01:19,737
<i>You were great!</i>

738
01:01:20,112 --> 01:01:22,170
<i>a good rehearsal.</i>

739
01:01:22,347 --> 01:01:25,806
<i>Damage is mostly along the coast.
The tide in some spots...</i>

740
01:01:25,985 --> 01:01:28,920
<i>his second win
at Talladega Superspeedway.</i>

741
01:01:29,088 --> 01:01:32,956
<i>And trying to do what he has to do
to win the championship.</i>

742
01:01:33,126 --> 01:01:36,755
<i>And that means he really needs
to win this race and Iowa...</i>

743
01:01:36,929 --> 01:01:41,333
<i>...and he needs to see Frank Kimble
finish out of the top 26.</i>

744
01:01:41,501 --> 01:01:42,592
<i>That's all he can do.</i>

745
01:01:42,768 --> 01:01:44,532
<i>He does. You had it figured earlier.</i>

746
01:01:44,737 --> 01:01:46,706
<i>It can happen.
He knows what he has to do.</i>

747
01:01:46,873 --> 01:01:48,840
<i>He sat on the pole.
He has to win here...</i>

748
01:01:49,009 --> 01:01:51,534
<i>...then go into Iowa
and give it everything he's got.</i>

749
01:01:51,744 --> 01:01:54,543
<i>Bobby Gerhart put so much effort
into Superspeedway...</i>

750
01:01:54,748 --> 01:01:56,079
Honey, I'm home.

751
01:01:58,050 --> 01:01:59,576
Mommy!

752
01:01:59,753 --> 01:02:04,849
What is it, baby?
You're okay, aren't you? Aren't you?

753
01:02:07,693 --> 01:02:08,990
They killed Jenny.

754
01:02:09,163 --> 01:02:11,130
- Hey, Beavis.
- Hey, Butt-Head.

755
01:02:11,298 --> 01:02:13,391
- Everything under control?
- Looks that way.

756
01:02:13,567 --> 01:02:14,965
Good.

757
01:02:16,336 --> 01:02:17,394
May I?

758
01:02:17,570 --> 01:02:19,902
Please, be my guest.

759
01:02:20,375 --> 01:02:24,835
I'm sure you're wondering, captain,
where this hunting rifle came from.

760
01:02:25,012 --> 01:02:26,503
Or does it look familiar?

761
01:02:26,681 --> 01:02:28,980
Did you ever go hunting with Fred?

762
01:02:29,418 --> 01:02:34,583
Can you believe that your darling
little boy just tried to kill me with this?

763
01:02:35,123 --> 01:02:37,489
I know it's hard to believe,
but it's the truth...

764
01:02:37,659 --> 01:02:40,423
...and nothing but the truth,
right, Georgie?

765
01:02:44,833 --> 01:02:47,324
- What do you think about that, Tom?
- That's bad.

766
01:02:47,503 --> 01:02:49,597
What time is it?

767
01:02:49,771 --> 01:02:51,034
After 11.

768
01:02:51,208 --> 01:02:54,871
I think we should think about
winning our bet, don't you?

769
01:02:55,045 --> 01:02:58,378
In fact, we should be very grateful
to little Georgie here...

770
01:02:58,547 --> 01:03:01,483
...for helping us out so much.

771
01:03:02,152 --> 01:03:04,143
One for Beavis.

772
01:03:04,521 --> 01:03:06,420
One for Butt-Head.

773
01:03:08,425 --> 01:03:10,119
Okay.

774
01:03:12,563 --> 01:03:15,498
<i>Eenie, meenie, minie, mo
Catch the tiger by the toe</i>

775
01:03:15,666 --> 01:03:20,969
<i>If he hollers let him go
Eenie, meenie, minie, mo</i>

776
01:03:25,809 --> 01:03:27,503
You look really blue.

777
01:03:28,179 --> 01:03:30,476
Tell me now, how old are you?

778
01:03:33,717 --> 01:03:35,844
She doesn't wanna play.

779
01:03:37,255 --> 01:03:39,485
How old do you think she is?

780
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:41,487
Thirty, 37?

781
01:03:42,894 --> 01:03:44,521
No jelly rolls.

782
01:03:45,463 --> 01:03:49,398
Let's be generous, let's say 35, okay?

783
01:03:49,568 --> 01:03:51,262
You agree?

784
01:03:52,204 --> 01:03:53,601
She agrees.

785
01:03:54,072 --> 01:03:56,541
So who do you want to start with?

786
01:03:56,708 --> 01:03:58,175
With her?

787
01:03:59,043 --> 01:04:00,101
Good.

788
01:04:00,778 --> 01:04:03,577
Now, I'll get something to eat.

789
01:04:06,985 --> 01:04:11,047
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven...

790
01:04:25,871 --> 01:04:28,396
Does anyone want anything?

791
01:04:30,110 --> 01:04:31,634
Hm?

792
01:04:57,438 --> 01:04:59,302
You're an idiot, Tubby.

793
01:04:59,472 --> 01:05:03,137
You don't kill the person who's
counted out, you kill the one left over.

794
01:05:03,311 --> 01:05:05,335
What's wrong with you?

795
01:05:05,545 --> 01:05:07,742
- He tried to run away.
- So what?

796
01:05:07,914 --> 01:05:10,007
That's no reason to get trigger-happy.

797
01:05:10,184 --> 01:05:12,947
Don't you have any sense of timing?

798
01:05:13,121 --> 01:05:14,985
What time is it?

799
01:05:15,556 --> 01:05:18,320
- Almost 12.
- Shit.

800
01:05:18,492 --> 01:05:20,324
They're spent.

801
01:05:21,429 --> 01:05:25,798
- Come on, let's get out of here.
- Okay.

802
01:05:25,967 --> 01:05:30,871
Thanks for the driver.
I'm gonna put it back in the bag, okay?

803
01:05:31,639 --> 01:05:32,972
Yes?

804
01:05:33,141 --> 01:05:37,976
- Okay, thanks. Have a nice evening.
- See you.

805
01:05:38,914 --> 01:05:40,041
Ciao.

806
01:05:40,215 --> 01:05:42,547
<i>Juan Montoya gave
a shove to Steve Wallace.</i>

807
01:05:42,717 --> 01:05:47,382
<i>Wallace took over the point, Gerhart
dropped all the way back to ninth.</i>

808
01:05:50,326 --> 01:05:53,295
<i>Blake Bjorklund throwing his name
into the hat as well.</i>

809
01:05:53,463 --> 01:05:58,126
<i>As far as potential drivers
wanting to win here at Talladega...</i>

810
01:05:58,300 --> 01:06:03,034
<i>...Pete Shepherd, another development
driver in the 39 for Roush Racing.</i>

811
01:06:03,373 --> 01:06:05,170
<i>Jack Roush
actually made the comment:</i>

812
01:06:05,342 --> 01:06:08,505
<i>"He reminds me
of a young Mark Martin."</i>

813
01:06:09,244 --> 01:06:13,079
<i>Pretty big impressive statement
from Jack Roush. Bob Dillner.</i>

814
01:06:13,250 --> 01:06:15,809
<i>You never know
what's gonna happen on pit road.</i>

815
01:06:15,985 --> 01:06:19,650
<i>Pretty funny. Just a second ago,
Brad Parrott ran down here.</i>

816
01:06:19,822 --> 01:06:23,088
<i>You see him right now.
He's in the 61 pit stall...</i>

817
01:06:23,260 --> 01:06:26,389
<i>...and that's because
those two are working together.</i>

818
01:06:26,563 --> 01:06:29,896
<i>In fact, Juan Montoya
came over the radio and said:</i>

819
01:06:30,068 --> 01:06:34,400
<i>"I am going to stick to the back bumper
of the 61 like glue...</i>

820
01:06:34,572 --> 01:06:36,199
<i>...until the white flag."</i>

821
01:06:36,373 --> 01:06:39,775
<i>So Brad Parrott ran down here
to the crew just to explain things...</i>

822
01:06:39,943 --> 01:06:42,673
<i>...and apparently stayed there
just to hang out a little bit.</i>

823
01:06:43,648 --> 01:06:46,775
<i>Well, wait a second,
you can't tell your strategy...</i>

824
01:06:46,952 --> 01:06:49,215
<i>...to the guy you're racing against.</i>

825
01:06:49,387 --> 01:06:51,548
<i>Well, they're saying that now.</i>

826
01:06:51,722 --> 01:06:55,717
<i>If the cars get shuffled, that outside line
gets running, they could get busted up.</i>

827
01:06:55,893 --> 01:06:58,795
<i>Juan on the radio minutes ago,
talking to his father, saying:</i>

828
01:06:58,963 --> 01:07:02,262
<i>"Where do I go? The high side,
the low side? What line do I get in?"</i>

829
01:07:02,434 --> 01:07:04,402
<i>Nobody said nothing.</i>

830
01:07:44,945 --> 01:07:46,971
They've gone.

831
01:07:56,590 --> 01:07:58,820
Do you hear that?

832
01:08:04,766 --> 01:08:06,233
They're gone.

833
01:08:54,149 --> 01:08:56,811
I'Il... I'll get a knife.

834
01:11:58,675 --> 01:12:00,369
Calm down.

835
01:12:01,011 --> 01:12:04,240
Just breathe. Please, just breathe.

836
01:12:06,515 --> 01:12:08,346
Please, breathe.

837
01:12:08,518 --> 01:12:10,577
Breathe, breathe.

838
01:12:51,662 --> 01:12:53,961
We gotta get out of here.

839
01:13:02,173 --> 01:13:04,539
They may come back.

840
01:13:05,844 --> 01:13:07,140
We...

841
01:13:08,613 --> 01:13:10,739
We need to go.

842
01:13:15,353 --> 01:13:17,253
Okay.

843
01:13:19,091 --> 01:13:20,992
Can you walk?

844
01:13:22,359 --> 01:13:25,488
- I'll help you.
- I'll try.

845
01:13:36,274 --> 01:13:38,072
What is it?

846
01:14:03,970 --> 01:14:05,801
Okay.

847
01:14:10,612 --> 01:14:12,373
Okay.

848
01:15:03,899 --> 01:15:07,358
Let's go. Please, let's go.

849
01:15:40,704 --> 01:15:42,296
It's locked.

850
01:15:45,610 --> 01:15:47,975
We'll have to go through the window.

851
01:15:51,948 --> 01:15:53,779
Oh, God.

852
01:15:54,652 --> 01:15:57,143
George, please, please.

853
01:15:57,322 --> 01:16:00,448
I can't, baby. I can't.

854
01:16:00,626 --> 01:16:03,823
Come on. Come on.

855
01:16:05,497 --> 01:16:07,430
You go.

856
01:16:07,666 --> 01:16:11,123
You go. Okay?

857
01:16:12,003 --> 01:16:16,134
If they locked the door,
they probably locked the gate too.

858
01:16:16,541 --> 01:16:18,305
You're right.

859
01:16:21,345 --> 01:16:23,780
Take the pliers, okay?

860
01:16:24,850 --> 01:16:27,283
Cut through the fence.

861
01:16:28,153 --> 01:16:32,386
Be careful when you get to the street,
they might be waiting, okay?

862
01:16:32,557 --> 01:16:34,320
Where are the pliers?

863
01:16:35,895 --> 01:16:37,795
Fuck.

864
01:16:39,865 --> 01:16:42,060
They're in the kitchen, I think.

865
01:16:42,269 --> 01:16:43,859
No. In the greenhouse.

866
01:16:45,137 --> 01:16:48,470
Hon, please, you got to get dressed,
don't you?

867
01:16:48,707 --> 01:16:52,576
Put some shoes on
because you might have to run.

868
01:16:53,712 --> 01:16:55,648
I can't leave you here, no.

869
01:16:55,814 --> 01:16:59,274
Just go. We're losing time.

870
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:04,384
No, wait, the bag's here.
The bag's here, so...

871
01:17:13,900 --> 01:17:15,698
I'll hide in the cellar.

872
01:17:16,103 --> 01:17:19,163
Okay? I'll wait for you.

873
01:17:21,710 --> 01:17:23,871
How will you get down there?

874
01:17:25,244 --> 01:17:26,577
I don't know.

875
01:17:26,747 --> 01:17:29,716
- Fuck.
- I'll manage, though.

876
01:17:41,564 --> 01:17:43,860
Please, just go.

877
01:17:45,368 --> 01:17:46,858
Please.

878
01:18:07,288 --> 01:18:09,154
George, it's working.

879
01:18:09,358 --> 01:18:13,123
- What?
- It must have dried. It's working again.

880
01:18:13,296 --> 01:18:14,786
Call someone.

881
01:18:15,064 --> 01:18:17,498
- Who?
- The police.

882
01:18:18,068 --> 01:18:19,932
Okay.

883
01:18:30,947 --> 01:18:32,881
It isn't ringing.

884
01:18:33,618 --> 01:18:35,448
Let me listen.

885
01:18:43,661 --> 01:18:45,652
It's probably still wet.

886
01:18:45,829 --> 01:18:47,957
There's a signal.

887
01:18:49,033 --> 01:18:50,796
Wait a minute.

888
01:19:02,213 --> 01:19:03,612
Where's yours?

889
01:19:04,716 --> 01:19:07,115
It's in the fucking car.

890
01:19:35,881 --> 01:19:37,747
Nothing.

891
01:19:40,953 --> 01:19:44,150
Get the hair dryer. That might work.

892
01:19:44,323 --> 01:19:45,814
Here.

893
01:19:46,525 --> 01:19:49,154
- I need a chair.
- Oh, God.

894
01:19:50,530 --> 01:19:52,520
I'm sorry.

895
01:20:09,114 --> 01:20:11,606
It's not working, honey.

896
01:21:46,649 --> 01:21:47,777
Forget it.

897
01:21:48,185 --> 01:21:49,311
Forget it.

898
01:21:49,720 --> 01:21:51,951
Maybe it just doesn't work.

899
01:21:52,724 --> 01:21:54,715
We're wasting time.

900
01:21:55,326 --> 01:21:58,625
Just pull me over in the chair. I'll try.

901
01:21:59,162 --> 01:22:00,528
Okay?

902
01:22:00,698 --> 01:22:02,393
You got to go now.

903
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:04,158
Okay.

904
01:22:06,970 --> 01:22:08,734
Shit, sorry.

905
01:22:30,695 --> 01:22:32,323
You gotta go.

906
01:22:32,731 --> 01:22:34,528
- Go, now.
- Okay.

907
01:22:34,699 --> 01:22:35,757
Please.

908
01:22:35,934 --> 01:22:37,628
Ann.

909
01:22:41,739 --> 01:22:43,832
Please forgive me.

910
01:22:58,759 --> 01:23:01,250
I love you.

911
01:23:04,730 --> 01:23:06,722
I love you.

912
01:23:07,902 --> 01:23:08,958
I love you.

913
01:23:09,569 --> 01:23:12,198
You run, okay?

914
01:23:12,372 --> 01:23:13,805
Just run.

915
01:25:11,095 --> 01:25:12,858
Hello!

916
01:25:17,068 --> 01:25:19,161
Hello!

917
01:25:19,337 --> 01:25:21,568
Help me!

918
01:25:22,341 --> 01:25:24,399
Help!

919
01:26:04,853 --> 01:26:06,411
Hello?

920
01:26:07,221 --> 01:26:10,453
Can you hear me?
This is George Farber.

921
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:13,992
I live at 55 Neck Lane...

922
01:26:14,864 --> 01:26:17,127
...in the head of the harbor.

923
01:26:19,536 --> 01:26:21,868
They killed my son.

924
01:26:26,842 --> 01:26:28,810
Can you hear me?

925
01:26:31,148 --> 01:26:32,206
Shit.

926
01:26:51,336 --> 01:26:54,668
Hello? I just called.

927
01:28:39,648 --> 01:28:42,275
Hey! Hey!

928
01:28:43,284 --> 01:28:45,185
Wait!

929
01:30:19,752 --> 01:30:21,378
Ann?

930
01:30:47,345 --> 01:30:50,338
Player one, level two.

931
01:30:56,922 --> 01:30:58,015
Damn it.

932
01:30:58,190 --> 01:31:00,158
Good morning, captain.

933
01:31:02,162 --> 01:31:03,823
Good morning.

934
01:31:05,532 --> 01:31:08,092
They'll be here any minute.

935
01:31:08,268 --> 01:31:11,600
Then we'd better hurry, right, Beavis?

936
01:31:11,771 --> 01:31:13,363
How old did we say? 37?

937
01:31:13,573 --> 01:31:15,039
- Thirty-five.
- Okay, 35.

938
01:31:15,208 --> 01:31:17,769
- Why won't you believe me?
- One, two, three...

939
01:31:17,944 --> 01:31:20,140
- It's a good thing the charger's
in the car.

940
01:31:20,314 --> 01:31:23,305
nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15...

941
01:31:23,484 --> 01:31:26,145
If it's her age,
you have to start with her.

942
01:31:26,319 --> 01:31:27,309
Why?

943
01:31:27,488 --> 01:31:29,456
Because those are the rules, blockhead.

944
01:31:29,625 --> 01:31:31,887
Okay, well, I'll start with her, then.

945
01:31:32,127 --> 01:31:33,649
The battery wasn't dead yet.

946
01:31:33,828 --> 01:31:36,796
- One, two, three, four...
- Yeah, I know.

947
01:31:36,998 --> 01:31:40,457
It's time to think of something new.
The lady tried that this afternoon.

948
01:31:40,667 --> 01:31:43,569
- Count faster, Beavis.
- Eleven, 12, 13, 14...

949
01:31:43,738 --> 01:31:45,729
I mean,
how primitive do you think we are?

950
01:31:45,907 --> 01:31:49,001
It's not a bet if there's nothing at stake,
right, captain?

951
01:31:49,176 --> 01:31:51,167
I mean, even you need a chance.

952
01:31:51,345 --> 01:31:54,872
The wind blows where it wants to.
That's why sailing is fun.

953
01:31:55,050 --> 01:31:57,847
- Twenty-nine, 30, 31, 32...
- Right, isn't it?

954
01:31:58,052 --> 01:32:01,180
...33, 34, 35.

955
01:32:01,355 --> 01:32:03,846
Now, don't make
the same mistake twice.

956
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:07,494
It's not the person counted out,
it's the one left over.

957
01:32:11,265 --> 01:32:12,824
Wait a minute.

958
01:32:13,403 --> 01:32:15,097
I see a new toy.

959
01:32:15,270 --> 01:32:17,761
I think we have the lady
to thank for this.

960
01:32:20,043 --> 01:32:23,011
This is gonna make things
a little bit more interesting.

961
01:32:23,945 --> 01:32:26,506
It's boring when mutes suffer.

962
01:32:27,449 --> 01:32:31,353
We want to entertain our audience,
right?

963
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:33,786
Show them what we can do.

964
01:32:40,296 --> 01:32:42,595
You're allowed to play another game.

965
01:32:42,765 --> 01:32:47,065
The name of this game
is The Loving Wife.

966
01:32:47,671 --> 01:32:49,662
Otherwise known as:

967
01:32:50,173 --> 01:32:53,667
Whether by Knife
or Whether by Gun...

968
01:32:54,479 --> 01:32:57,878
...Losing Your Life
Can Sometimes Be Fun.

969
01:32:59,083 --> 01:33:00,948
Come on, don't fall asleep.

970
01:33:01,453 --> 01:33:04,081
You have to play,
otherwise I have to gag you again...

971
01:33:04,253 --> 01:33:06,587
...and you don't like that, do you?

972
01:33:08,760 --> 01:33:11,592
So the rules of this game are...

973
01:33:12,063 --> 01:33:14,930
...Georgie Sr. is counted out, okay?

974
01:33:15,100 --> 01:33:17,591
He's up next.
There's nothing to be done about it...

975
01:33:17,769 --> 01:33:20,466
...unless you wanna jump in for him.
Do you?

976
01:33:21,774 --> 01:33:24,900
Do you? Beavis is not gonna mind.
Right, Tubby?

977
01:33:25,077 --> 01:33:27,271
- Don't call me Tubby.
- See, he doesn't mind.

978
01:33:27,444 --> 01:33:30,846
- Just get on with it, this is enough.
- Enough?

979
01:33:31,250 --> 01:33:33,844
You really think it's enough?
What about you, Ann?

980
01:33:34,018 --> 01:33:36,953
Do you think it's enough,
or you wanna keep playing?

981
01:33:37,122 --> 01:33:41,582
Don't answer. Let them do
what they want, it'll be over faster.

982
01:33:41,993 --> 01:33:43,461
Oh, come on.

983
01:33:44,029 --> 01:33:46,462
Stop being such a coward.

984
01:33:47,032 --> 01:33:50,524
Do you think it's enough?
I mean, you want a real ending, right?

985
01:33:50,737 --> 01:33:54,671
With plausible plot development,
don't you?

986
01:33:54,975 --> 01:33:57,807
The bet is still on.
You can't cancel it by yourself.

987
01:33:57,976 --> 01:34:01,175
So the name of the game
is The Loving Wife.

988
01:34:01,614 --> 01:34:04,550
Now, although Beavis
is already finished counting...

989
01:34:04,818 --> 01:34:08,219
...Ann can decide who's up next...

990
01:34:08,387 --> 01:34:11,323
...and with which device.

991
01:34:13,828 --> 01:34:15,658
Which do you prefer?

992
01:34:16,831 --> 01:34:20,528
The little knife or the big gun?

993
01:34:22,069 --> 01:34:24,502
What's the housewife's choice?

994
01:34:27,073 --> 01:34:29,405
You have to admit, Ann...

995
01:34:30,278 --> 01:34:32,507
...I'm being very generous here.

996
01:34:32,913 --> 01:34:36,645
You can prove to your pussy husband
how much you love him.

997
01:34:37,853 --> 01:34:42,483
And between friends,
it barely costs you anything.

998
01:34:42,657 --> 01:34:46,219
Doesn't really matter
if you crap out now or later.

999
01:34:46,494 --> 01:34:48,155
Right?

1000
01:34:48,329 --> 01:34:51,422
Hello! Wake up!
What, you're not interested?

1001
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:57,265
You don't want to play anymore? Beavis,
show her how the game is played. Here.

1002
01:34:57,439 --> 01:34:59,167
Watch out.

1003
01:34:59,341 --> 01:35:02,242
- I almost cut myself.
- Really?

1004
01:35:11,354 --> 01:35:15,311
Come on, come on, sit down,
sit down, sit down.

1005
01:35:18,427 --> 01:35:20,555
That's the little knife.

1006
01:35:23,099 --> 01:35:26,193
Ann, you can spare him the pain.

1007
01:35:26,869 --> 01:35:30,465
You just... You have to play with us.

1008
01:35:33,775 --> 01:35:36,369
Everything's gonna be fine.

1009
01:35:44,921 --> 01:35:49,756
- What do you want me to do?
- You see, wasn't so difficult.

1010
01:35:53,430 --> 01:35:55,091
Good.

1011
01:35:59,569 --> 01:36:00,797
Okay.

1012
01:36:02,139 --> 01:36:04,003
Say a prayer.

1013
01:36:04,875 --> 01:36:06,274
Any one you want.

1014
01:36:06,511 --> 01:36:10,002
If you can say it
without any mistakes...

1015
01:36:10,381 --> 01:36:12,282
...then God is on your side...

1016
01:36:12,448 --> 01:36:15,613
...and you get to choose
what happens next.

1017
01:36:15,786 --> 01:36:17,310
Okay?

1018
01:36:18,890 --> 01:36:22,519
Okay? Or should we continue
with Georgie Sr?

1019
01:36:28,899 --> 01:36:31,390
I don't know any prayers.

1020
01:36:34,271 --> 01:36:36,432
You don't know any prayers?

1021
01:36:37,143 --> 01:36:38,837
Not even one?

1022
01:36:39,645 --> 01:36:43,206
Is that possible?
Where the...? Where the hell are we?

1023
01:36:43,448 --> 01:36:47,680
- Tubby, tell her one.
- Stop calling me "Tubby" all the time.

1024
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:49,409
Okay, fine.

1025
01:36:49,921 --> 01:36:51,719
Tell her one.

1026
01:36:54,926 --> 01:36:58,488
<i>I love you, God, with all my might
Keep me safe all through the night</i>

1027
01:36:59,998 --> 01:37:03,435
- That's too short.
- I don't know any others.

1028
01:37:04,170 --> 01:37:05,431
Okay.

1029
01:37:06,172 --> 01:37:10,576
<i>I love you, God, with all my might
Keep me safe all through the night</i>

1030
01:37:12,311 --> 01:37:14,041
<i>I love you, God, with all my might...</i>

1031
01:37:14,213 --> 01:37:17,307
No, you can't say it like that.
It's a prayer, Ann.

1032
01:37:18,051 --> 01:37:22,954
You can't just drone on like that.
You're asking the Lord for something...

1033
01:37:24,658 --> 01:37:26,557
...so pray properly.

1034
01:37:26,827 --> 01:37:29,489
Come on, get down on your knees.

1035
01:37:29,697 --> 01:37:34,259
Yeah, kneel properly.
Put your hands together. That's good.

1036
01:37:35,002 --> 01:37:36,698
Not on your stomach.

1037
01:37:36,970 --> 01:37:41,703
Where's the person you're praying to, hm?
Up there, right? So, pray up there.

1038
01:37:42,342 --> 01:37:44,037
Now, Ann...

1039
01:37:44,212 --> 01:37:48,171
...from the bottom of your heart, pray.

1040
01:37:50,018 --> 01:37:54,078
- Beavis, can you help me out here?
- No!

1041
01:37:55,489 --> 01:37:59,393
Oh, God, I love you, God,
with all my might.

1042
01:37:59,795 --> 01:38:05,027
Please, keep me safe
all through the night, please.

1043
01:38:07,435 --> 01:38:09,063
Bravo.

1044
01:38:09,304 --> 01:38:12,033
That was fantastic.

1045
01:38:12,740 --> 01:38:16,302
Okay, that was the test run. Now
we're gonna go for the Olympic Gold.

1046
01:38:16,511 --> 01:38:19,037
If you can say this...

1047
01:38:19,215 --> 01:38:24,278
...little, unfortunately,
much too short of a prayer backwards...

1048
01:38:24,453 --> 01:38:26,079
...with no mistakes...

1049
01:38:26,256 --> 01:38:31,158
...not only will you be able to decide
which one of you bites it first...

1050
01:38:31,327 --> 01:38:34,228
...but also... And I'm sure this
is gonna interest you more.

1051
01:38:34,396 --> 01:38:36,228
with which device...

1052
01:38:37,734 --> 01:38:41,261
...whether it's the fast
and almost painless big gun...

1053
01:38:41,471 --> 01:38:43,063
...or the slow, drawn-out...

1054
01:38:45,676 --> 01:38:47,471
Look out!

1055
01:38:58,787 --> 01:39:00,484
Shit.

1056
01:39:01,992 --> 01:39:06,292
Where's the remote control?
Where's the fucking remote control?

1057
01:39:37,729 --> 01:39:39,219
Okay, that was the test run.

1058
01:39:39,398 --> 01:39:41,296
Now we're gonna go
for the Olympic Gold.

1059
01:39:41,466 --> 01:39:44,060
If you can say this...

1060
01:39:44,235 --> 01:39:49,229
...little, unfortunately,
much too short of a prayer backwards...

1061
01:39:49,408 --> 01:39:51,069
...with no mistakes...

1062
01:39:51,243 --> 01:39:56,011
...not only will you be able to decide
which one of you bites it first...

1063
01:39:56,181 --> 01:39:59,243
...but also... And I'm sure
this is gonna interest you even more.

1064
01:39:59,417 --> 01:40:01,215
with which device...

1065
01:40:02,721 --> 01:40:06,213
...whether it's the fast
and almost painless big gun...

1066
01:40:06,393 --> 01:40:08,054
...or the slow, drawn-out...

1067
01:40:13,666 --> 01:40:16,067
You shouldn't have done that, Ann.

1068
01:40:16,703 --> 01:40:18,898
You're not allowed to break the rules.

1069
01:40:20,207 --> 01:40:22,175
I'm sorry.

1070
01:40:22,341 --> 01:40:23,899
You failed.

1071
01:40:26,680 --> 01:40:29,081
Say goodbye to Georgie.

1072
01:41:18,100 --> 01:41:20,625
Would you please take a seat?

1073
01:42:11,188 --> 01:42:13,282
Give me your gloves.

1074
01:42:19,262 --> 01:42:20,855
So everything
is its mirror image.

1075
01:42:21,032 --> 01:42:24,024
But, of course, all these predictions
are lies to avoid panic.

1076
01:42:24,202 --> 01:42:25,863
Now Kelvin knows what's going on.

1077
01:42:26,037 --> 01:42:28,301
He wants to warn his wife
and daughter in time.

1078
01:42:28,471 --> 01:42:31,533
The problem isn't only
how to escape the anti-material world...

1079
01:42:31,710 --> 01:42:33,837
...but also how to communicate
between the two worlds.

1080
01:42:34,011 --> 01:42:35,809
- Finally there's a gap...
- Look.

1081
01:42:37,716 --> 01:42:40,844
Now, that is what I call Olympic spirit.

1082
01:42:44,055 --> 01:42:47,220
Hey, Tubby, be careful. Jesus.

1083
01:42:48,094 --> 01:42:50,186
Didn't you say you couldn't swim?

1084
01:43:01,573 --> 01:43:04,509
Bring the widow over here,
otherwise she's gonna get lonely.

1085
01:43:04,676 --> 01:43:07,407
Oh, wait. Wait, wait, wait.

1086
01:43:07,914 --> 01:43:09,438
Now.

1087
01:43:10,048 --> 01:43:14,314
Help me here, please.
It's difficult, you might get hurt.

1088
01:43:18,890 --> 01:43:21,257
- So where was I?
- There we go.

1089
01:43:21,426 --> 01:43:23,225
You were...

1090
01:43:25,765 --> 01:43:29,462
You were discussing the difference
between communicating...

1091
01:43:29,636 --> 01:43:33,935
...between the material universe
and the anti-material universe, right?

1092
01:43:34,108 --> 01:43:36,599
Exactly.
It's like you're inside of a black hole.

1093
01:43:36,777 --> 01:43:39,268
The gravitational force
is so great that nothing...

1094
01:43:39,445 --> 01:43:43,041
...absolutely nothing can escape, which
means absolutely no communication.

1095
01:43:43,217 --> 01:43:45,082
- But Kelvin has this...
- What time is it?

1096
01:43:45,252 --> 01:43:48,119
- What?
- What's the time?

1097
01:43:49,890 --> 01:43:51,255
After 8.

1098
01:43:51,426 --> 01:43:53,121
Already?

1099
01:44:03,238 --> 01:44:05,832
Why? The deadline was 9.
She had almost another hour.

1100
01:44:06,006 --> 01:44:08,497
Well, it's too difficult to sail like this...

1101
01:44:08,676 --> 01:44:09,974
...first of all.

1102
01:44:10,177 --> 01:44:11,907
Second of all...

1103
01:44:12,515 --> 01:44:16,006
- ...I'm getting kind of hungry.
- That's true.

1104
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:33,291
And when he overcomes
the gravitational forces...

1105
01:44:33,469 --> 01:44:37,097
...it turns out that one universe
is real and the other one is fiction.

1106
01:44:37,274 --> 01:44:38,672
How?

1107
01:44:38,841 --> 01:44:42,208
How do I know? It's a kind of
model projection in cyberspace.

1108
01:44:42,412 --> 01:44:45,711
Okay, so where's your hero now?
Is he in reality or is he in fiction?

1109
01:44:45,914 --> 01:44:48,440
His family's in reality,
and he's in fiction.

1110
01:44:48,618 --> 01:44:51,484
- But isn't fiction real?
- Why?

1111
01:44:51,654 --> 01:44:54,385
Well, you can see it in the movie,
right?

1112
01:44:54,557 --> 01:44:55,786
Of course.

1113
01:44:55,958 --> 01:44:59,985
Well, then it's just as real as reality...

1114
01:45:00,162 --> 01:45:03,462
...because you can see it too, right?

1115
01:45:03,632 --> 01:45:05,362
Bullshit.

1116
01:45:05,702 --> 01:45:06,828
Why?

1117
01:45:49,113 --> 01:45:50,239
Hello?

1118
01:45:51,751 --> 01:45:53,684
Is anyone there?

1119
01:45:58,891 --> 01:46:00,552
Hello?

1120
01:46:01,527 --> 01:46:03,256
Yes?

1121
01:46:03,429 --> 01:46:05,090
Hello?

1122
01:46:05,264 --> 01:46:07,426
- Hello.
- Who's there?

1123
01:46:07,600 --> 01:46:12,229
Good morning. I'm sorry
to bother you so early, ma'am.

1124
01:46:12,939 --> 01:46:14,804
Ann sent me.

1125
01:46:15,007 --> 01:46:16,305
Yes?

1126
01:46:16,509 --> 01:46:18,738
You don't remember me, do you?

1127
01:46:18,912 --> 01:46:21,311
We met yesterday, at the dock.

1128
01:46:21,515 --> 01:46:23,481
- Paul.
- Oh, yes.

1129
01:46:23,650 --> 01:46:25,618
- Good morning.
- Morning.

1130
01:46:27,287 --> 01:46:29,381
Ann sent me over because...

1131
01:46:30,088 --> 01:46:31,648
Some guests dropped by...

1132
01:46:31,891 --> 01:46:35,328
...and she was wondering if you
could help her out with some eggs.

1133
01:46:35,796 --> 01:46:36,956
Well, I guess so.

1134
01:46:37,131 --> 01:46:39,725
- It's okay?
- Yeah, come on in. Just wait a second.

1135
01:46:39,899 --> 01:46:41,457
Okay.
