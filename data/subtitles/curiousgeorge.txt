1
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:07,843
Who's to say
What's impossible

2
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:12,097
Well, they forgot
This world keeps spinning

3
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:14,323
And with each new day

4
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,162
I can feel a change in everything

5
00:01:20,164 --> 00:01:23,791
And as the surface breaks,
reflections fade

6
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:28,463
But in some ways, they remain the same

7
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:33,384
And as my mind begins
to spread its wings

8
00:01:34,178 --> 00:01:37,889
There's no stopping curiosity

9
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:42,977
I want to turn the whole thing
upside down

10
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:47,940
I'll find the things
they say just can't be found

11
00:01:48,192 --> 00:01:52,612
I'll share this love I find
with everyone

12
00:01:52,905 --> 00:01:57,158
We'll sing and dance
to Mother Nature's songs

13
00:01:57,493 --> 00:02:00,703
I don't want this feeling to go away

14
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:22,793
Who's to say I can't do everything

15
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:24,769
Well, I can try

16
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:29,357
And as I roll along I begin to find

17
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,986
Things aren't always just what they seem

18
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:39,200
I want to turn the whole thing
upside down

19
00:02:39,827 --> 00:02:43,830
I'll find the things
they say just can't be found

20
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:48,584
I'll share this love I find
with everyone

21
00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:53,256
We'll sing and dance
to Mother Nature's songs

22
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:55,242
This world keeps spinning

23
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:59,262
And there's no time to waste

24
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:05,043
Well, it all keeps spinning,
spinning round and round

25
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:07,103
And upside down

26
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:12,108
Who's to say what's impossible
and can't be found

27
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:15,570
I don't want this feeling to go away

28
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:24,871
Please don't go away

29
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:34,463
Please don't go away

30
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:43,973
Please don't go away

31
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:53,983
Is this how it's supposed to be

32
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:59,697
Is this how it's supposed to be

33
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:11,235
Now, as I was saying, life was
a constant struggle for survival.

34
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:14,863
Australopithecus had no time
to enjoy himself,

35
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:18,633
because around every corner was danger.

36
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,470
- Way to go.
- Oh, good one.

37
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:26,250
It wasn't until an amazing discovery

38
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:29,586
that man was able to take time
and enjoy life.

39
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:30,754
And why was that?

40
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:34,508
What made Ogg and Grogg's life
so much better?

41
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:36,051
- A video game?
- No.

42
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:37,302
- The Internet?
- No.

43
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:39,388
- A rocket sled?
- A mountain of chocolate.

44
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:40,821
- Star stickers?
- No.

45
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:43,517
- Look. No, no, that wasn't a real question.
- Peanut butter?

46
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:44,867
That's right.

47
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:46,535
Fire.

48
00:04:49,373 --> 00:04:51,358
Look at that. Impressive, huh?

49
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:56,405
Miss Dunlop, why do we have to come
to this boring museum every single week?

50
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:59,908
It's not boring. It's very interesting.

51
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,451
This led to hot dinners.

52
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:04,136
- Eventually became the microwave.
- Three, two, one.

53
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:06,389
Oh! Oh, no.

54
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,557
Hot. Fire's hot.

55
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:11,894
Yes. Where was I?

56
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:14,840
- Hey, is that a real spear?
- Can we play with it?

57
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:18,844
Kids, a museum is a place
where we observe. We don't play.

58
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:20,637
- This stinks.
- What else can we do?

59
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,015
- Yeah, this is boring.
- Children, be polite.

60
00:05:23,115 --> 00:05:25,142
- Lunchtime!
- Yeah, lunch.

61
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:27,519
Lunchtime? It's only 9:00 a.m.

62
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:30,204
Buddy system. Stay with your buddies.

63
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:35,126
Oh, well, each kid has a buddy
so they can all keep track of each other.

64
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:37,654
Everyone needs a partner, right?

65
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:41,048
Oh, yeah. I'm not following.

66
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:43,551
Well...

67
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,164
- Lungfish!
- Excuse me?

68
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:50,334
Next Thursday, I'm going to talk
to your class about the lungfish,

69
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:53,503
the closest living relative
of the tetrapods.

70
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:57,299
- It's pretty great.
- I look forward to hearing it.

71
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:00,093
You know, I look forward
to all your Thursday lectures.

72
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,444
I wish today was Thursday.

73
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:05,239
- I mean, I know that it's Thursday.
- Don't worry.

74
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:08,352
- I just meant, when it's not, I wish it was.
- It's not a big deal.

75
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:09,452
Here.

76
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,289
I should go catch up to
my lungfish. I mean, class.

77
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,026
Way to go, Maggie. Way to go.

78
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:18,085
I'll see you next week, Miss Dunlop.

79
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:21,964
Oh, how embarrassing.

80
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:25,369
- Ted?
- Mr. Bloomsberry.

81
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:27,136
Walk with me, Ted.

82
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:31,124
I'm afraid that Ogg and Grogg,
all of our friends here,

83
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:34,169
they're just not bringing in
the crowds like they used to.

84
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:35,295
What do you mean?

85
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:40,217
It breaks my heart, but I have
to sell the museum. We're broke.

86
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:44,054
Broke? Mr. Bloomsberry,
the museum can't close!

87
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:48,183
I have no choice, Ted.
Museum attendance is down.

88
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:50,268
No one's buying anything
from the gift shop.

89
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:52,938
Even the glow-in-the-dark star stickers?

90
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:55,790
Even the glow-in-the-dark star stickers.

91
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,026
Man, I love those.

92
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:00,737
I especially love the Milky Way... Wait!

93
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,739
What will happen to the museum?

94
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,908
- Well, I'm glad you asked.
- Junior?

95
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:07,953
It'll be torn down and a
parking lot put in its place,

96
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:11,347
with high hourly rates
and no daily maximums.

97
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:12,749
Ka-ching!

98
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:15,810
The world doesn't need
another parking lot.

99
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:19,172
The world needs a place
where kids' brains can grow.

100
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,508
Exactly. That's why I'm thinking

101
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:25,178
they can grow trying to count
all the spaces in the new parking lot.

102
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,139
Come on. How fun is that?

103
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:29,266
- He's not serious, is he?
- Well...

104
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:32,102
It's time, Father. We're not
going to get a better offer.

105
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:33,895
I know. I know.

106
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:36,523
Wait. What if we did something?

107
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:38,692
What if we got an amazing new exhibit?

108
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:42,211
You know, Ted, you need to worry
about finding an amazing new job.

109
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:45,741
- Well, hold on, Junior.
- But I was just trying... Oh, great.

110
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:49,593
Ted, if you have an idea, now is
the time to speak up. What exhibit?

111
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:51,079
Yes, what exhibit?

112
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:53,290
- It's the...
- Yes?

113
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,751
- The famous and...
- Yes.

114
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:58,086
- And rare, of course...
- Yes. Yes.

115
00:07:58,186 --> 00:07:59,921
- The incredible...
- Come on.

116
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:02,424
- Spit it out.
- Don't be shy, Ted. Come on.

117
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:04,426
What about the Lost Shrine of Zagawa?

118
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:06,193
Oh, my goodness.

119
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:10,223
I'm sorry. "The lost..."
You lost me at, "the lost."

120
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,059
It's an ancient idol.

121
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:13,643
Twenty tons of granite

122
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:17,496
carved by 1,000 craftsmen
over a 100 years.

123
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:19,816
I had all the charts ready.

124
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:24,253
I was all set to go to Africa
when something happened.

125
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:26,531
Slips my mind.

126
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:30,577
Hello, how about the birth
of your only son? That would be me.

127
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:35,415
Yes, then I began another adventure,
raising Junior.

128
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:40,311
Well, now that that's done, you can
finally finish what you've started,

129
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:44,424
- which is bringing home...
- Yeah! The Lost Shrine of Zagawa.

130
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,510
You'll put this museum on the map.

131
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:49,096
- I'll need a team of 10 men.
- Oh, at least 10.

132
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:50,764
It's a four-day hike into the jungle.

133
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,072
You go, girl.

134
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,949
I mean, sir.

135
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:57,062
We'll be cutting through
heavy brush for 12 hours a day.

136
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:59,689
Look out. Here comes
the Bloomsberry Express!

137
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:03,334
- Yes! Yes!
- Next stop archeological fame and fortune!

138
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:08,214
I'm going to discover
the Lost Shrine of Zagawa!

139
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,508
- A little help here.
- Hey, watch it!

140
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,832
I forgot something.

141
00:09:16,932 --> 00:09:20,142
I am really, really old.

142
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:24,422
Can I have the Bloomsberry Express
pull into the reality station

143
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:26,842
and sign here, initial here.
Nope, not there.

144
00:09:26,942 --> 00:09:28,943
Wait! I guess I could go.

145
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:32,055
Did I just say that? I can't do that.

146
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:34,724
I don't even ride the bus.
Maybe they didn't hear me.

147
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:36,393
I'm sorry, sir. You were saying?

148
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:38,061
Excellent idea, Ted.

149
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:39,646
He did hear me.

150
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:44,234
Him? You've got to be kidding me.
Ted is not an explorer.

151
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:46,570
- He raises a good point.
- Nonsense.

152
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:50,157
With my maps and my journals,
a six-year-old could find the shrine.

153
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:52,033
Thank you, I think.

154
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:55,177
Come on. Let's get you ready
for your big adventure.

155
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:58,456
Now, Ted, the journal
won't take you right to the idol.

156
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:00,933
- It won't?
- No, you have to use your instincts.

157
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:05,354
- About that, sir, I don't have any.
- Don't be silly. It'll be fun.

158
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,279
Sorry, Ted.

159
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:17,267
But that's as close
as you're ever going to get

160
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:21,146
to the precious Lost Shrine
of Zaga-wah-wah-wah...

161
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:25,332
Why does my father like you best?
It's not fair. I've got the ponytail.

162
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,092
Okay, Ted, the trick is to look like
you know what you're doing.

163
00:10:36,011 --> 00:10:37,886
Now, where's the door?

164
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:42,099
Yellow? Six dozen yellow suits?

165
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:45,837
Tony, what, are you goofy?
We can't sell these things.

166
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:48,298
Hey, me goofy? Forget about it.

167
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:50,884
The big guy says move them,
we move them.

168
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:54,679
Oh, yeah, sure, but what kind
of meatball would buy these?

169
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:56,932
Excuse me?

170
00:10:57,032 --> 00:11:01,201
I'm here to be professionally outfitted
for a jungle expedition.

171
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:02,812
Showtime.

172
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,272
Good day, mate.

173
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:07,442
You've stepped into the right place.
Isn't that right, Nigel?

174
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:12,239
I'll say it is, Steve-O.
Finally, a real adventurer to suit up.

175
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:15,867
- So do you like the color yellow?
- Yellow?

176
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:19,219
Yeah, what, are you goofy?
Yellow's the new khaki.

177
00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:22,931
- Mate.
- Really? Well, okay.

178
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,586
- You've got to be kidding.
- Look at that get-up.

179
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,005
Hello, who are you, the six-foot banana?

180
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:30,689
"The new khaki."

181
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,568
Thank you! Thank you very much!

182
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,237
I look like an idiot.

183
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:49,526
- Edu.
- Yes, sir?

184
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:52,779
Don't worry the other men,
but we're hopelessly lost.

185
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:55,323
Sir, your book is upside down.

186
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:58,759
- Oh. Oh, good catch. Carry on.
- Thank you, sir.

187
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:02,414
- Wow. What is it?
- That's interesting.

188
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:05,307
- Look at this.
- Beautiful.

189
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:06,835
Look at the color.

190
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:08,628
Edu, do you see this?

191
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:12,231
- Yes, it's...
- Exciting! We are so close.

192
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:16,386
- Edu.
- Mr. Ted.

193
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:19,389
It says here "Zagawa"
means enlightenment.

194
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:21,891
- I know, sir. I live here.
- Oh, right.

195
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:24,602
Did you know the statue we're
looking for is a giant monkey?

196
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:27,397
- Yes, sir. I live here.
- Right again.

197
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:29,399
- Oh, a rhino.
- Sir?

198
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:30,734
- Stand aside, men.
- Mr. Ted.

199
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:33,028
This is a tranquilizer gun.
I'm just going to put him to sleep.

200
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:34,336
That's not a rhino. That's a...

201
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,339
Nice shot, Mr. Ted.

202
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:44,096
Oops! Okay, let's break for lunch

203
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:47,083
for the next four to six hours,

204
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,643
or longer, depending on
how much he weighs.

205
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:54,257
I should probably make
a sandwich for Edu.

206
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:58,068
He'll have quite an appetite
and a headache when he wakes up.

207
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:01,196
This is really good.

208
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:08,954
Hey!

209
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:14,042
Oh, a monkey. Hey, there, little guy.

210
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,212
Can I have my hat, please?

211
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:19,991
I kind of need my hat.

212
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:23,886
Sun's hot, and I freckle.
Not the good kind either. I blotch.

213
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:26,096
So please, my hat.

214
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:30,017
That's the one, all right.

215
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:37,941
Hello. Anybody in there?

216
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,235
Peekaboo.

217
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:42,738
Peekaboo.

218
00:13:44,908 --> 00:13:46,059
Peekaboo.

219
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,160
Aboo. Aboo.

220
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:53,582
Well, look at that.
A monkey who likes to play peek-a-boo.

221
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:58,962
Hey, this was fun, my little friend,
but, sorry, I've got to go.

222
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:03,550
I wonder if Edu's up yet.

223
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:07,846
Hey! Come back here.

224
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:15,854
You can run, but you can't hide.
I'll catch up. I am unstoppable.

225
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:20,218
That's right. I can run all night.

226
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:23,847
All day and all night.
There's nothing that can stop...

227
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:28,825
Cramp! Cramp. Cramp can stop me.
Why the cramp? Extra-bad cramp, too.

228
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:32,287
What? What...

229
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:41,255
Okay, I have an idea.

230
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,424
We'll trade. Sandwich for the hat.

231
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:46,468
On three.

232
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:49,972
One, two, three!

233
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,599
Okay.

234
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:56,103
We're not really making
any progress here.

235
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:02,401
Okay. Oh, yeah.

236
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:20,794
191, 192, 193, 194.

237
00:15:23,006 --> 00:15:24,199
Not now, monkey.

238
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:27,494
196, 197, one-ninety-monkey.

239
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:29,595
199, 200.

240
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:35,960
Okay, "Look for two mufuti bushes,
and you will find X."

241
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,187
- There, sir. Mufutis.
- Good eye, Edu.

242
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:41,690
Here, hold this.

243
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:51,809
There it is. It's awesome.
It's spectacular.

244
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:54,703
It's... Gone?

245
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:59,150
What? This can't be it.

246
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,777
Did you find it, sir?

247
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:03,530
It's supposed to be huge.
But that isn't huge, okay?

248
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:07,033
That's the opposite of huge.
I need the giant monkey.

249
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:09,551
Who knew it was actual size?

250
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:14,290
Wait. This looks like ancient Swatabi.

251
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,876
"Turn your eye to the light.

252
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:20,129
"Go from blindness to sight."

253
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,480
That's a clue.

254
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:24,926
"Turn your eye to the light."

255
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:28,904
All right, I'm looking
directly into the sun.

256
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:32,725
It's very bright. It's starting to sting.
Not going to lie to you.

257
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:36,896
Okay, now... Now, it's burning,
and it's continuing...

258
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,899
Oh, I singed my cornea. Oh, I'm blind.

259
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:48,173
Okay, water, H2O, just a little
liquid refreshment, please.

260
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:52,078
Oh, there it is.
Oh, sweet relief. Thank you, Edu.

261
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:53,413
Edu, Edu, Edu.

262
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:56,098
All right, men, let's pick it up.

263
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:58,767
I'll be over here
until my vision returns.

264
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:03,605
I traveled 10,000 miles
for a paper weight?

265
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:07,719
What am I going to tell Mr. Bloomsberry?

266
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:14,434
Bloomsberry? Wow. Strong signal.

267
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:17,953
- Hello?
- Ted, it's me. Have you found it yet?

268
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,523
Yeah, I'm looking at it right now.

269
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:23,026
Oh, that's great. Is it gigantic?

270
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:25,445
Well, there is a size issue, sir.

271
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:28,448
I'll send you a photo
so you can see for yourself.

272
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,090
I can't wait.

273
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:32,592
Do you see it, sir?

274
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,121
I do.

275
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:36,873
Oh, sir. Are you crying?

276
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:39,975
It's supposed to be 40 feet tall.

277
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:42,420
I'll explain it all when I get back.

278
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,340
No need to. I can see it right here.

279
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:49,886
I can't believe it.

280
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:51,596
Do you see that, Junior?

281
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:54,432
It's even bigger than I ever imagined!

282
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:57,727
Well, that's impossible.
I... I can't believe he...

283
00:17:57,827 --> 00:17:59,995
Hurray. We're saved.

284
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:03,832
Mr. Ted, time to go.

285
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:13,884
You know what? Keep the hat.

286
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:19,723
Hey, don't look so sad.

287
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:23,602
It's the new khaki. It's true. Bye.

288
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:41,020
Edu, I can't find the seat belt.
Will that be a problem?

289
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,454
Not for me.

290
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,316
- Edu, it's okay to use the brake.
- Oh, relax.

291
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:48,111
I want to be where the talk of the town

292
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:52,198
Is about last night
when the sun went down

293
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:55,201
Yeah, and the trees all dance

294
00:18:55,301 --> 00:19:00,222
And the warm wind blows
in the same old sound

295
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:04,168
And the trouble I find
is that the trouble finds me

296
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:07,813
I'm beginning to find
it begins with a dream

297
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,300
And a feeling I get
when I look and I see

298
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,138
That this world is a puzzle
Find all of the pieces

299
00:19:15,238 --> 00:19:18,725
And put it all together
Then I'll rearrange it

300
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:21,952
I'll follow it forever And maybe

301
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:28,359
Maybe now the water below
gives a gift to the sky

302
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:31,946
And the clouds give back
every time they cry

303
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:35,533
Make the grass grow green
beneath my toes

304
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:37,410
And if the sun comes out

305
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,537
Gonna paint a picture all about

306
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:41,638
The colors I've been dreaming of

307
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:43,249
Mr. Bloomsberry...

308
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:47,143
I would just like to say
in my defense that...

309
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,479
Sir, when we set out

310
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,774
on certain adventures in life,

311
00:19:56,153 --> 00:20:00,115
sometimes... Sometimes,
they don't quite go as planned.

312
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:02,560
I'm extra sorry.

313
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:05,855
Oh, boy. Maybe I could
just work on this ship,

314
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:08,748
be a deckhand or a chef.

315
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,298
I'm so glad I upgraded.

316
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:20,051
Oh, the knee! There's the forehead!

317
00:20:20,595 --> 00:20:22,038
Knee-forehead combo.

318
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:06,473
No, no, no,
not the honey-roasted goodness.

319
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:09,851
And there's the head again.

320
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:34,026
Hey, it's a monkey with a hat!

321
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:37,128
I'll just go ahead and put that under
"Miscellaneous."

322
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,624
Well, I'm just people watching

323
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:52,394
The other people watching me

324
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:57,967
- Where you going, Yellow?
- Bloomsberry Museum, please.

325
00:21:58,067 --> 00:22:01,470
You know, I'll give you $10 extra
if you'll stop calling me Yellow.

326
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,113
You got it, Sunshine.

327
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:12,273
There really ain't no use in stopping

328
00:22:12,373 --> 00:22:16,376
What nobody never told me not to do

329
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:20,448
So I'll keep people watching

330
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:24,551
Watching me now
Finding my way back to you

331
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:32,267
For crying out loud, lady,
there's no screaming in cabs.

332
00:22:33,561 --> 00:22:36,589
We're all as lonely as we wanted to be

333
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:37,673
Hey, yo, over here.

334
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:40,343
Just as lonely as we wanted to be

335
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,153
Wait! What does that say?

336
00:22:43,663 --> 00:22:46,489
"The Lost Shrine of Zagawa"? "Gigantic"?

337
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:52,287
Oh, that's not right at all.
"The shrine is 40 feet tall"?

338
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:54,857
I know. That bad boy's a monster.

339
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:58,084
I can't wait to see it.
I'm taking the whole family.

340
00:22:58,753 --> 00:23:01,755
Yeah, well,
I hope you get seats up front.

341
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,842
Yo! Over here!

342
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:15,060
Puppies!

343
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:19,564
No, watch the claws. Watch the claws.

344
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:28,432
Yeah, sure,
I've seen everything in this town.

345
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:30,575
Oh, yeah, monkey? Seen it.

346
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:48,218
I'm as lonely as I wanted to be

347
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:52,873
We're as lonely as we wanted to be

348
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:57,670
We're as lonely as we wanted to be

349
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:00,423
Construction. Of all the luck...

350
00:24:00,523 --> 00:24:04,135
You know what? Sir, I'll just get out
right here. Right, this will work.

351
00:24:04,235 --> 00:24:06,762
I'm just going to go home,
call Mr. Bloomsberry,

352
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:10,182
- and explain everything, right?
- Sure. Whatever. $12.50, pal.

353
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,575
Sorry.

354
00:24:14,745 --> 00:24:16,371
Okay, I'm moving.

355
00:24:30,094 --> 00:24:33,805
- Watch out!
- Hey, what, you couldn't see me? Right.

356
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:48,971
Hey, there, Ivan.

357
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:51,906
Good talk. Take care.

358
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:16,264
Home.

359
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:24,355
Okay, I just need two seconds of quiet.

360
00:25:27,902 --> 00:25:30,069
All right, I didn't mean literally.

361
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:33,808
- Hello?
- Ted!

362
00:25:33,908 --> 00:25:36,185
Hi, Mr. Bloomsberry.
I just walked in the door.

363
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:39,563
Well, get down here.
All the news reporters are here.

364
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:42,024
I've arranged a press conference
just for you.

365
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:44,083
You're the hero of the moment.

366
00:25:46,629 --> 00:25:49,990
- Oh, have you seen the surprise?
- Surprise, sir?

367
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:52,034
Look out your front window.

368
00:25:52,134 --> 00:25:54,829
- My window?
- Yes, yes, take a looksy.

369
00:25:54,929 --> 00:25:58,014
- Okay.
- You're really going to like it.

370
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:01,476
Well, what do you think?

371
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:06,648
Speechless. I knew you'd love it.

372
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:12,654
Ted, you deserved it.
I don't know what I would have done.

373
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:15,307
You single-handedly saved the museum.

374
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,685
Mr. Bloomsberry, I have
to tell you something.

375
00:26:17,785 --> 00:26:18,853
Yes, I'm all ears.

376
00:26:18,953 --> 00:26:21,230
- It's about...
- Yes, what?

377
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:23,399
- My hat?
- Sure, wear your hat.

378
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:26,459
Wear your best suit. Just get down here.

379
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:31,631
There can't be two hats like that.

380
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:35,009
Pet?

381
00:26:39,223 --> 00:26:40,765
Pet.

382
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,685
My hat? My yellow hat?

383
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:46,813
No, no, no, this can't be the same hat.

384
00:26:47,523 --> 00:26:48,898
It's the same hat.

385
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:50,692
And the same monkey.

386
00:26:51,068 --> 00:26:53,888
Wait! You followed me
all the way from Africa

387
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:56,572
to play peekaboo.

388
00:26:59,702 --> 00:27:00,702
No.

389
00:27:03,664 --> 00:27:04,914
No again.

390
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:07,583
No.

391
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:09,627
No.

392
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,046
No. No. No.

393
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:14,841
No. No. No.

394
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:17,051
No. No. No. No.

395
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,679
Hold the phone.

396
00:27:20,097 --> 00:27:22,499
No, no, no, I don't
want to play peekaboo.

397
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:27,103
Open up, 17-B. I know you're in there.

398
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:29,632
Open up! Ivan don't like to wait!

399
00:27:29,732 --> 00:27:33,693
- What? Oh, no. Monkey. Monkey.
- Come on, open the door!

400
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:35,153
Where are you?

401
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:38,349
Oh, hi. Ivan!

402
00:27:38,449 --> 00:27:39,975
I'm smelling pet.

403
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:42,811
Pet? No. No, no pet here.
Can't have a pet.

404
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:44,787
Wait. Isn't there a no-pet policy?

405
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:47,623
- Yes.
- Hey, you can't just barge in here.

406
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:49,959
Apparently you can.

407
00:27:52,713 --> 00:27:54,172
Pet is close.

408
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:58,494
- What?
- Nothing.

409
00:27:58,594 --> 00:28:01,095
Just practicing for when I find pet.

410
00:28:06,727 --> 00:28:09,421
Monkey. Monkey, no. Down. Down.

411
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:12,273
Down. No, no, no!

412
00:28:12,983 --> 00:28:15,552
Why you yell when I'm right next to you?

413
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:16,986
No reason.

414
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:22,950
What?

415
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:25,495
Milk is sour. Don't drink.

416
00:28:30,084 --> 00:28:32,627
Bingo! Now, move, please.

417
00:28:33,295 --> 00:28:35,421
New game. New game. Hide-and-seek.

418
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:39,034
Okay, stay right there.

419
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:40,510
Good monkey.

420
00:28:57,027 --> 00:28:58,345
Did you hear something?

421
00:28:58,445 --> 00:28:59,487
No.

422
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,326
- How about that?
- Nope.

423
00:29:07,788 --> 00:29:09,732
If you're asking,
I didn't hear that either.

424
00:29:09,832 --> 00:29:11,165
Move self.

425
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:14,069
Oh, that.

426
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:17,213
I unroll it ahead of time.
Helps when you're in a rush.

427
00:29:17,673 --> 00:29:20,659
Where the pet? Where the...
Can't find pet nowhere.

428
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:24,303
Very strange. Nose does not lie.

429
00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:27,291
Well, that was fun.

430
00:29:27,391 --> 00:29:30,502
Next time we'll have to do it
at your place, okay, Ivan?

431
00:29:31,812 --> 00:29:33,088
Miss Plushbottom.

432
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:35,716
Oh, no. That's trouble.

433
00:29:35,816 --> 00:29:38,401
Monkey! Oh, Mr. Monkey.

434
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:43,223
If I find pet, you are ewicted.

435
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:45,351
- E-what-ed?
- Evicted!

436
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:46,659
Good to know.

437
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:51,038
Oh, no.

438
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:55,668
Oh, that's a big drop, Ted.
Don't look down.

439
00:29:56,837 --> 00:30:00,089
Rickety's okay. Just as long
as there's no wind.

440
00:30:00,841 --> 00:30:02,967
Oh, sweet mother of science!

441
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:07,122
Cramp. Cramp again. Cramp. Cramp.

442
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:08,598
Darn that cramp.

443
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:11,184
No, no, no, no.

444
00:30:11,293 --> 00:30:14,963
No, these are not the colors I wanted.

445
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:18,967
I told you to match them
to the City Opera.

446
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:24,556
They are the same colors,
Miss Plushbottom.

447
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,532
They may look like it,

448
00:30:26,909 --> 00:30:29,160
but do they sing to me?

449
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:34,248
You are fired

450
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,985
- Hey, she fired us in song.
- It still hurts.

451
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:39,587
And now, I must have a soak.

452
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:14,765
Okay, fellows, last stop. Everybody off.

453
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:21,089
No, paint? You've got to be kidding me.

454
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:23,983
Who leaves eight open cans
of paint lying around?

455
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:34,785
Of course he went in there.

456
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:45,129
Oh, boy.

457
00:32:47,633 --> 00:32:52,136
Monkey. Monkey.
Over here. Come, monkey. Come on.

458
00:32:52,262 --> 00:32:54,873
Monkey, peekaboo. Peekaboo.

459
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:55,973
Monkey!

460
00:32:58,727 --> 00:33:00,879
No, no, no, no, quiet.

461
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,146
What's that?

462
00:33:02,272 --> 00:33:06,108
Do yourself a favor. You're going to
want to put the cucumbers back on.

463
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:12,365
Ivan!

464
00:33:13,033 --> 00:33:14,685
I knew it!

465
00:33:14,785 --> 00:33:17,062
You are red-handed with pet!

466
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:18,313
And while we're on the subject,

467
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:22,192
I think you have a serious
pest problem in this building, Ivan.

468
00:33:22,292 --> 00:33:25,112
I mean, don't you spray
for jungle animals every spring?

469
00:33:25,212 --> 00:33:28,323
I specifically remember
such language in my lease.

470
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:30,242
Let go. Not helping.

471
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:32,093
Look at my walls!

472
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:34,162
- And you!
- Moi?

473
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:37,082
You hired a monkey
to paint your apartment.

474
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:38,542
How do you sleep at night?

475
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:41,686
He is your monkey! Now what do you say?

476
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:45,340
Come on. That could be
any guy in a yellow suit,

477
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,967
silk-starched collar, black spotted tie.

478
00:33:47,067 --> 00:33:48,468
Ivan!

479
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:51,612
Well, that was fun. Bye-bye.

480
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,448
Sorry. My fault.

481
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:59,620
Lovely apartment. Could we borrow
your window? Got to go.

482
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:03,775
You are no more 17-B!

483
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,793
You are kicked from building.

484
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:09,114
Just to be clear, though,
the monkey's kicked? Not me?

485
00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:10,214
Get out!

486
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:16,429
Foot caught.

487
00:34:20,642 --> 00:34:22,518
What am I going to do with you?

488
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:28,175
Come on. We're almost
at the museum. Act natural.

489
00:34:28,275 --> 00:34:29,551
Try to blend in.

490
00:34:31,862 --> 00:34:34,389
We're all people watching

491
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:38,743
- Come on.
- The other people watching we

492
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:45,958
Nobody told me what to do

493
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:49,988
I can't stop breaking all the rules

494
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:52,491
And I'm just people watching

495
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:54,216
Oh, that tickles.

496
00:34:54,843 --> 00:34:56,969
He's grooming me. Everyone's doing it.

497
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:59,206
- They're getting small monkeys and...
- Hi.

498
00:34:59,306 --> 00:35:00,681
- Never mind.
- So cute.

499
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:07,438
I forgot all about them.
Quick, monkey, this way.

500
00:35:10,192 --> 00:35:11,192
Okay.

501
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:14,653
Oh, no.

502
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:17,740
What have they done?

503
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,701
These are cheesy, ridiculous.

504
00:35:21,161 --> 00:35:22,536
Okay, that's kind of fun.

505
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:25,774
- How much longer is this going to take?
- Let's all be patient, please.

506
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:30,195
Ted will be more than happy to answer
all your questions regarding the giant idol.

507
00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:31,587
- Yes, but where is he?
- Oh, boy.

508
00:35:31,713 --> 00:35:34,783
- I just spoke to Ted. He's on his way.
- Run, monkey. Run.

509
00:35:34,883 --> 00:35:36,217
Quick, in here.

510
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:39,261
What am I going to do?

511
00:35:40,722 --> 00:35:42,723
This is beyond bad.

512
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:46,420
Hey, monkey.

513
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:49,563
Quiet. Monkey. I said, quiet!

514
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:52,107
Well, we gave it a shot, didn't we?

515
00:35:52,234 --> 00:35:55,220
I mean, huge monkey statues,
they come and go,

516
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,222
but parking lots are forever.

517
00:35:57,322 --> 00:35:59,266
Excuse me. Would you please...

518
00:35:59,366 --> 00:36:00,892
Oh, look who's back.

519
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:03,145
Would you stop that?
I have to concentrate.

520
00:36:03,245 --> 00:36:07,289
And he's wearing a yellow suit.
What, is he officially the golden child now?

521
00:36:09,376 --> 00:36:11,502
Monkey, put that down. No.

522
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:15,297
Oh, I've got problems.
Oh, do I have problems.

523
00:36:15,841 --> 00:36:17,784
Glorious day, Ted has problems.

524
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:20,454
What am I going to do? What can I do?

525
00:36:20,554 --> 00:36:24,124
There's no way around it.
I have to tell Mr. Bloomsberry the truth.

526
00:36:24,224 --> 00:36:25,709
- The horrible...
- Horrible?

527
00:36:25,809 --> 00:36:26,976
- ...awful...
- Awful?

528
00:36:27,102 --> 00:36:30,046
- ...devastatingly crushing truth.
- Devastatingly crushing?

529
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:33,607
His enormous idol looks like
it came out of a cereal box.

530
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:36,887
Wow, that must be
a huge box of cereal, or...

531
00:36:36,987 --> 00:36:38,722
It's only three inches tall.

532
00:36:38,822 --> 00:36:43,200
Yes! This is great.
What a great day for parking lots.

533
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:47,288
Oh, my body.

534
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:49,039
Hey, a dollar.

535
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:53,061
Yeah, it spins. Fun, huh?

536
00:36:53,161 --> 00:36:54,795
Ted? Hello?

537
00:36:56,256 --> 00:36:59,242
Oh, there you are? What's with that?

538
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:00,968
Clovis, I can explain.

539
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:05,373
I should hope so because that
is a lot of yellow for one man.

540
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:08,126
You see, it's...
I thought you were color blind.

541
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:09,878
I can see that.

542
00:37:09,978 --> 00:37:13,465
Oh, before I forget,
here's a bill for my services.

543
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:16,384
$2,000? What's this for?

544
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:20,263
The exhibition stage
for the Lost Shrine of Zagawa.

545
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:22,573
- Mr. Bloomsberry?
- Watch this.

546
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:29,147
Behold the Eighth Wonder of the World!

547
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:34,585
Clovis whipped it up.
Doesn't it take your breath away?

548
00:37:35,045 --> 00:37:36,503
More than you know.

549
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:48,140
Okay, let's get down to business.
Where's the shrine?

550
00:37:51,895 --> 00:37:53,062
What's that?

551
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:59,109
Behold the Eighth Wonder of the World!

552
00:38:00,362 --> 00:38:03,431
But, Ted, that can't be the idol.

553
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:06,935
I don't understand. We saw the picture.
The statue is huge.

554
00:38:07,035 --> 00:38:09,604
I'm sorry, sir, but it is.

555
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:13,374
I've been trying
to tell you, this is this.

556
00:38:15,669 --> 00:38:18,738
Oh, Ted, what are we going to do?

557
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:21,575
Okay, here he is, everybody.
Right this way.

558
00:38:21,675 --> 00:38:24,369
The man of the hour. Our hero.

559
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:26,538
No pushing. We'll all get a chance.

560
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:29,165
Hey, Ted, they can't wait
for you to tell them

561
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:33,727
about the massively gigantic,
huge, enormous idol.

562
00:38:33,937 --> 00:38:35,589
Don't be shy. Right up there. Come on.

563
00:38:35,689 --> 00:38:39,092
Now's not the time for butterflies, Ted.
Speak right into the mike.

564
00:38:39,192 --> 00:38:41,803
You're good?
You checked that that's working, right?

565
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:44,222
- Louder.
- Any questions?

566
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:47,074
Over here. Can you tell how old it is?

567
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:49,811
Sounded like "old,"
but what she said was "big."

568
00:38:49,911 --> 00:38:51,537
How big is it?

569
00:38:52,414 --> 00:38:54,107
You know, I'm not sure about that.

570
00:38:54,207 --> 00:38:58,278
Could you tell us, was it difficult finding
a boat big enough to bring the idol back?

571
00:38:58,378 --> 00:39:01,171
No. No, didn't have
a problem on the boat thing.

572
00:39:01,381 --> 00:39:03,257
It... Yeah, it fit nicely.

573
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:06,885
Excuse me. What was your first
reaction when you saw the idol?

574
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:11,333
I was emotional. Teared up
pretty much instantly.

575
00:39:11,433 --> 00:39:14,502
Guy, guys, guys, let's focus here.
We're here about the idol.

576
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:16,504
So, Ted, where is the idol now?

577
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:18,564
Yes, yes, yes, where is the idol?

578
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:23,094
It's... It's close. It's...
It's very close.

579
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:25,388
What else we got? Come on, guys.
Fire away. Keep them coming.

580
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:29,616
Excuse me. Rumor has it the idol
has magical powers. Is that true?

581
00:39:29,743 --> 00:39:31,686
- Well, that all depends.
- Yeah, good one. Now, ask him where it is.

582
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:34,230
- Was it difficult to find?
- Is it made of solid gold?

583
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:36,483
- And how big is the idol?
- Are you going to write a book?

584
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:37,583
What about a movie deal?

585
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:40,487
- Oh, no, that's not a good idea.
- It's not? Why?

586
00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:43,156
Not the Apatosaurus formerly
known as the brontosaurus.

587
00:39:43,256 --> 00:39:44,783
- I'm sorry.
- No, don't!

588
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:47,843
This is very common when you
come back from the jungle.

589
00:39:48,678 --> 00:39:49,996
Bad idea! Monkey!

590
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:51,873
- Monkey, no!
- Can we please get back to questions

591
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:54,000
regarding when we will
actually see the idol?

592
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,753
- No, no, no! Monkey! No, no, no!
- You can't leave. Ted!

593
00:39:56,853 --> 00:39:58,463
- Please, no!
- Ted, before you leave, please...

594
00:39:58,563 --> 00:40:00,548
No!

595
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:02,524
Ted, where is the idol?

596
00:40:03,151 --> 00:40:06,737
Okay, careful. Careful,
that's the linch pin to the whole left leg.

597
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:16,580
Oh, no!

598
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:27,049
Wow, I didn't see that coming.

599
00:40:30,011 --> 00:40:33,097
Oh, Ted, we're doomed.

600
00:40:35,642 --> 00:40:36,918
What's a monkey doing here?

601
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:40,395
- I guess we should just take a picture.
- Quick, get a picture.

602
00:40:41,064 --> 00:40:43,758
Well, seriously, Ted,
can't say you didn't try.

603
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:46,720
I mean, you did bring back a monkey,
just not one anyone cared about.

604
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:48,513
- Okay, bye-bye.
- Hold on!

605
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:50,197
You're locking me out?

606
00:40:50,824 --> 00:40:52,533
Cabs are right behind you.

607
00:40:52,742 --> 00:40:53,742
Perfect.

608
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:59,441
Oh, no. No, no, no. No.
No, you don't. No.

609
00:40:59,541 --> 00:41:01,250
This is not going to work.

610
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:04,571
Here it is, "Animal Control."

611
00:41:04,671 --> 00:41:05,655
This better work.

612
00:41:05,755 --> 00:41:07,991
Hello, Animal Control.
How can I help you?

613
00:41:08,091 --> 00:41:11,260
Yes, could you send someone over
to the Bloomsberry Museum right away?

614
00:41:12,053 --> 00:41:14,456
We have a very dangerous monkey.

615
00:41:14,556 --> 00:41:17,250
Describe dangerous, sir.

616
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:19,252
Oh, he's frothing at the mouth.

617
00:41:19,352 --> 00:41:23,689
He's got teeth like
Ginsu knives and crazy eyes.

618
00:41:24,107 --> 00:41:26,301
He's a killer. Listen to this.

619
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:30,988
Put that child down!
Oh, the horror! I can't watch!

620
00:41:31,364 --> 00:41:33,975
Sir, we just closed,
but I can leave a message.

621
00:41:34,075 --> 00:41:36,227
What am I supposed to do
with this monkey?

622
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:37,812
I'm sure I don't know.

623
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:40,648
Thank you for calling
the Animal Control hotline.

624
00:41:41,958 --> 00:41:43,125
Hello?

625
00:41:44,961 --> 00:41:46,295
You, down.

626
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:55,455
Okay, listen. I'm only watching you

627
00:41:55,555 --> 00:41:57,514
until tomorrow, when Animal...

628
00:41:58,016 --> 00:42:01,268
Don't do that. Okay, maybe you're right.

629
00:42:01,603 --> 00:42:03,937
It's late. It's been a long day.

630
00:42:05,607 --> 00:42:08,275
I'm all out of ideas. What do you got?

631
00:42:12,113 --> 00:42:16,033
Oh, this is great. This is a great idea.

632
00:42:17,577 --> 00:42:19,896
I'm so comfortable here.
What are we lying on here?

633
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:23,207
Is this goose down? It's so comfy.

634
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:26,793
No, this is a concrete park bench.

635
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:29,546
That's what it is.

636
00:42:31,633 --> 00:42:35,677
Did I mention that it's a cold
concrete bench? Very cold.

637
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:57,491
Hey, shake all you want, monkey.
There's no bananas in there.

638
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:01,078
But if you find
a 40 foot idol, let me know.

639
00:43:14,634 --> 00:43:17,803
Eighth wonder of the world.
Right. What a nightmare.

640
00:43:36,823 --> 00:43:40,602
Oh, no. No, no, no,
don't look so satisfied with yourself.

641
00:43:40,702 --> 00:43:43,855
The whole reason we're sleeping
out here is because of you.

642
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:47,165
Yeah, I could be in my nice,
warm bed right now,

643
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:49,736
showered, teeth brushed

644
00:43:49,836 --> 00:43:53,547
instead of sleeping out
in the cold with a monkey

645
00:43:55,383 --> 00:43:57,009
under the stars.

646
00:44:01,806 --> 00:44:02,806
Wow.

647
00:44:03,808 --> 00:44:07,436
Those glow-in-the-dark star stickers
have nothing on this.

648
00:44:12,567 --> 00:44:14,818
That? That's a firefly.

649
00:44:26,998 --> 00:44:28,623
Good grab. Nice.

650
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:32,586
Yep, they're still in there.
Bright, huh?

651
00:44:33,129 --> 00:44:34,921
They're bioluminescent.

652
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:38,534
Did you know that fireflies glow
to remind us that they taste bitter.

653
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:40,177
It's a defense mechanism.

654
00:44:46,601 --> 00:44:49,061
Yeah. See? I told you.

655
00:44:53,191 --> 00:44:56,511
Oh, no. No, no, no.
No, thanks. I'm good.

656
00:44:56,611 --> 00:44:59,722
Yep, you know, there's no way
I'm going to eat that bug.

657
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:01,448
So quit trying...

658
00:45:03,576 --> 00:45:07,829
Oh, wow. Yeah, that tastes bad,
definitely bitter.

659
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:21,551
Okay. Oh, listen to this.
I've got a good one for you.

660
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:26,306
What's the difference between
Neanderthal man and Cro-Magnon man?

661
00:45:28,393 --> 00:45:32,312
Linguistic competence
and polychromatic cave paintings.

662
00:45:34,607 --> 00:45:35,816
Get it?

663
00:45:40,613 --> 00:45:41,655
Hello?

664
00:45:42,615 --> 00:45:44,684
You're missing the punch line.

665
00:45:44,784 --> 00:45:47,661
You see, it's the difference
between the two...

666
00:45:48,413 --> 00:45:50,023
It's always a winner.

667
00:45:56,546 --> 00:46:00,841
I need some fresh museum-related material.
People depend on me for those jokes.

668
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:34,708
No, no, those are dinosaur bones.
You can't park there.

669
00:46:34,959 --> 00:46:37,794
There's no parking here.
That's my office!

670
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:42,674
Oh, just a bad dream. Oh, boy.

671
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:45,953
Monkey? Monkey? Where are you?

672
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:47,246
A monkey flew!

673
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:48,873
Oh, no.

674
00:46:48,973 --> 00:46:51,584
- Run! Run!
- A monkey! A monkey!

675
00:46:51,684 --> 00:46:55,228
Wait. It's a zoo. A zoo is full of monkeys.
Who's to say it's mine?

676
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:57,131
- The monkey is chasing me!
- That's mine.

677
00:47:09,035 --> 00:47:11,828
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Look at that!

678
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:19,445
Oh, that's cold.
Oh, it's so much colder than you think.

679
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:21,838
I suggest never doing that. Ever.

680
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:24,700
Don't ever swim with penguins.
Swim with dolphins.

681
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,801
Freezing! It's going to be okay.

682
00:47:29,764 --> 00:47:31,139
Okay, your turn.

683
00:47:31,432 --> 00:47:32,933
There you are.

684
00:47:34,435 --> 00:47:35,852
Oh, Ted. Hi.

685
00:47:36,145 --> 00:47:37,562
Miss Maggie.

686
00:47:38,606 --> 00:47:39,648
Hi.

687
00:47:40,942 --> 00:47:42,301
What happened to you?

688
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:43,970
Oh, it didn't rain here?

689
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:45,096
Nope, not here.

690
00:47:45,196 --> 00:47:48,615
Wow, now, that's crazy.
Freak cloudburst down the street.

691
00:47:48,908 --> 00:47:49,892
Yeah, right.

692
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:52,077
- Hey, where you going?
- The monkey knows that guy?

693
00:47:52,203 --> 00:47:55,606
- Please tell me you paid for those.
- He thinks he's a banana.

694
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:57,999
So how long have you had a monkey?

695
00:47:58,125 --> 00:48:00,361
- I don't. I mean, I do.
- Oh, he's so cute.

696
00:48:00,461 --> 00:48:03,072
I really don't. I... Long story.

697
00:48:03,172 --> 00:48:05,032
Mr. Ted, what's your monkey's name?

698
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:07,034
- Yeah, what's his name?
- He doesn't have a name.

699
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:09,036
- He has to have a name.
- No, he doesn't.

700
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:10,580
- Let's give him a name.
- All right! Good idea.

701
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:12,039
- Please don't...
- Elvis.

702
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:13,166
- How about Jojo?
- Fred.

703
00:48:13,266 --> 00:48:14,459
- Hercules.
- Bananas.

704
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:16,419
- Mumble.
- No.

705
00:48:16,519 --> 00:48:17,712
- Skippy.
- What about Juan Carlos?

706
00:48:17,812 --> 00:48:20,548
Okay, you know what?
His name's Washington.

707
00:48:20,648 --> 00:48:22,008
Man, that's a dumb name.

708
00:48:22,108 --> 00:48:24,886
Then call him George.
How's that? Happy now?

709
00:48:24,986 --> 00:48:26,220
Oh, I like George.

710
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,989
- It's so cute.
- Oh, he's so cute.

711
00:48:32,201 --> 00:48:34,270
- Here, George. Take my balloon.
- Let's go play.

712
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:36,189
Here, George. Have a red one.

713
00:48:36,289 --> 00:48:38,290
- Here. Here's a balloon.
- Oh, you like blue, too?

714
00:48:39,834 --> 00:48:41,126
What's the use?

715
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:45,714
Ted, are you okay?

716
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:50,677
It's a long story, but it looks like
the museum is going to close.

717
00:48:50,803 --> 00:48:52,012
Really?

718
00:48:53,097 --> 00:48:55,082
I know how much you love the museum.

719
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:57,043
I do love the museum, Ted.

720
00:48:57,143 --> 00:48:59,837
But that's not really
why I go there every week.

721
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:03,898
Yeah, I know. Everyone likes the
cafeteria food. Gosh, it's good.

722
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:06,526
I've never had the cafeteria food.

723
00:49:07,403 --> 00:49:09,362
- Really?
- Really.

724
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:12,782
So you've never had
the tuna hash on Thursday?

725
00:49:13,034 --> 00:49:14,200
Never.

726
00:49:14,452 --> 00:49:15,853
It's really quite something.

727
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:17,313
I'll remember that.

728
00:49:17,413 --> 00:49:20,066
There's also a meatless
meatloaf on Monday,

729
00:49:20,166 --> 00:49:22,276
which is quite special.

730
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:23,402
Quite special.

731
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:26,447
Excuse me, mister.
You have to help George.

732
00:49:26,547 --> 00:49:28,824
- George who?
- George needs you.

733
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:30,076
Take a message. I'm busy.

734
00:49:30,176 --> 00:49:31,869
He has an emergency!

735
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:34,054
The restrooms are behind
the penguin habitat.

736
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:36,791
- Mister, your monkey's floating away.
- Look. Seriously, there he is.

737
00:49:36,891 --> 00:49:39,460
- He's what? He's what?
- There, look at him.

738
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:40,628
I'm not kidding.

739
00:49:40,728 --> 00:49:43,548
Hey, monkey! Don't be afraid.

740
00:49:43,648 --> 00:49:46,133
Just keep your head together,
and don't look down!

741
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:47,552
You've got to save George.

742
00:49:47,652 --> 00:49:49,387
- Who, me?
- Yes, you!

743
00:49:49,487 --> 00:49:50,680
- Hurry!
- Okay.

744
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:52,807
- Your monkey's going to fall quick! Hurry!
- Hurry, Ted. Hurry.

745
00:49:52,907 --> 00:49:53,933
He's floating away.

746
00:49:54,033 --> 00:49:55,309
I'm commandeering these balloons.

747
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:56,644
Hey! Hey, where are you going?

748
00:49:56,744 --> 00:49:58,229
I need that. Thank you, young fellow.

749
00:49:58,329 --> 00:50:00,439
- Can I borrow these?
- You're going to need a lot of balloons.

750
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:01,623
Here I go!

751
00:50:06,045 --> 00:50:07,905
Boy, glad that's over.

752
00:50:15,054 --> 00:50:17,373
Pay you back. Thank you.
You don't mind, do you?

753
00:50:17,473 --> 00:50:19,933
Official zoo business. Oh, my! Okay.

754
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:24,771
Wait for me, monkey!

755
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:27,482
Excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm trying to fly.

756
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:28,900
More altitude.

757
00:50:33,197 --> 00:50:35,156
Sorry, I need this kite.

758
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:40,229
How do you steer these things?

759
00:50:40,329 --> 00:50:42,831
Hang on, little fellow. I'm coming.

760
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:47,069
- Hey, look at that!
- It's some super-hero.

761
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:50,839
There's a high fly ball deep in
left-center field. We're going to win!

762
00:50:51,549 --> 00:50:54,342
We lost. And the curse continues.

763
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:00,625
Monkey!

764
00:51:00,725 --> 00:51:02,517
Monkey! Watch out!

765
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:06,813
Monkey! No!

766
00:51:10,985 --> 00:51:12,068
Watch out!

767
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:16,489
George! Whoa!

768
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:19,101
Got you.

769
00:51:21,746 --> 00:51:22,829
Wow.

770
00:51:28,878 --> 00:51:31,504
You're safe now, George. I've got you.

771
00:51:31,714 --> 00:51:34,132
It's all right. It's okay.

772
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:36,176
It's okay, George.

773
00:51:36,469 --> 00:51:40,247
George. I like that name. It suits you.

774
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:44,184
This is how it's supposed to be

775
00:51:45,186 --> 00:51:49,189
Hey, actually, this isn't too bad.

776
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:51,509
I can't believe I'm doing this.

777
00:51:51,609 --> 00:51:53,135
This is awesome.

778
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:57,682
I want to be where the water
below gives a gift to the sky

779
00:51:57,782 --> 00:52:01,352
And the clouds give back
every time they cry

780
00:52:01,452 --> 00:52:05,106
And make the grass grow green
Beneath my toes

781
00:52:05,206 --> 00:52:08,818
And if the sun comes out
I'll paint a picture all about

782
00:52:08,918 --> 00:52:10,611
The colors I've been dreaming of

783
00:52:10,711 --> 00:52:12,488
The hours just don't seem enough

784
00:52:12,588 --> 00:52:14,198
To put it all together

785
00:52:14,298 --> 00:52:17,133
Maybe it's as strange as it seems

786
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:23,040
And the trouble I find
is that the trouble finds me

787
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:25,126
Hey, down there! Hi!

788
00:52:25,226 --> 00:52:26,669
It begins with a dream

789
00:52:26,769 --> 00:52:30,131
And a feeling I get
when I look and I see

790
00:52:30,231 --> 00:52:33,884
That this world is a puzzle
Find all of the pieces

791
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:37,570
And put it all together
And then I'll rearrange it

792
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:39,390
I'll follow it forever

793
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:42,283
And maybe it's as strange as it seems

794
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:47,038
Look, George. There's the museum.

795
00:52:48,123 --> 00:52:52,043
Can you believe all those people
down there are waiting to see this?

796
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:54,029
Hey! Here it is!

797
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:56,548
Here's the giant idol, everybody!

798
00:52:57,508 --> 00:52:59,425
If only it was that big.

799
00:52:59,593 --> 00:53:03,263
Yeah, that's it, Ted.
Just make it bigger. No problem.

800
00:53:04,265 --> 00:53:05,332
Wait.

801
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:08,726
I can't make it bigger,
but I know who can.

802
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:13,273
George, now, hand me that
pink balloon, and hang on!

803
00:53:13,732 --> 00:53:15,733
That's close enough.

804
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:23,533
Let's see. Not too round.

805
00:53:23,826 --> 00:53:25,952
Well, this one's not round enough.

806
00:53:26,704 --> 00:53:28,663
Yes, perfect!

807
00:53:30,416 --> 00:53:33,360
Huh? Oh, I predicted this.

808
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:36,363
Balloon travel finally
coming back into fashion.

809
00:53:36,463 --> 00:53:37,797
Clovis, I've got a problem.

810
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:40,910
- Wait, just a minute. Are you returning him?
- What?

811
00:53:41,010 --> 00:53:43,537
Because I have a strict no-return policy

812
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:47,541
on any robotic animals I create,
unless, of course, you have a receipt.

813
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:51,337
What? No. Clovis, calm down.
This is George. He's a real monkey.

814
00:53:51,437 --> 00:53:52,713
Are you sure?

815
00:53:52,813 --> 00:53:56,817
Yes. I found him in the jungle.
Actually, he found me.

816
00:53:57,610 --> 00:54:01,696
Well, then, George, meet Sparky.
Sparky, George.

817
00:54:02,907 --> 00:54:05,658
- Clovis, I really need your help.
- You do?

818
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:07,019
Here's my problem.

819
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:08,395
I see.

820
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:10,189
Oh, you're just missing the chain.

821
00:54:10,289 --> 00:54:11,857
I think I have
an extra one right over...

822
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:13,750
No, this is the idol.

823
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:15,945
Ted, I'm not one to judge,

824
00:54:16,045 --> 00:54:20,506
but haven't you exaggerated
its size just a wee bit?

825
00:54:22,343 --> 00:54:23,593
Thanks, Frosty.

826
00:54:24,345 --> 00:54:25,595
What is that?

827
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:27,013
Nothing.

828
00:54:27,222 --> 00:54:29,083
- Should I be concerned?
- No.

829
00:54:29,183 --> 00:54:31,168
Not if you're behind that wall.

830
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:32,602
Fire in the hole!

831
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:34,646
George, look out!

832
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:43,264
Is that popcorn?

833
00:54:43,364 --> 00:54:45,198
I call it boom-corn.

834
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:48,743
It's for really big sleepovers
with a lot of kids.

835
00:54:50,871 --> 00:54:52,288
Not quite right.

836
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:58,378
Soaky, when you're done, could you...

837
00:54:59,088 --> 00:55:00,114
Thank you.

838
00:55:00,214 --> 00:55:02,783
All right, let's see what we
can do with that keychain.

839
00:55:02,883 --> 00:55:05,077
- Idol.
- Idol. Right. Yes.

840
00:55:06,387 --> 00:55:11,307
It's always more fun
to share with everyone

841
00:55:14,979 --> 00:55:17,298
It's always more fun

842
00:55:17,398 --> 00:55:20,858
To share with everyone

843
00:55:25,072 --> 00:55:27,057
If you have one

844
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:30,034
Here is something you can learn

845
00:55:34,373 --> 00:55:39,111
You can still share just by taking turns

846
00:55:39,211 --> 00:55:40,628
Here's an idea.

847
00:55:40,754 --> 00:55:44,674
I can make it into a snow globe,
a rain globe, or...

848
00:55:44,967 --> 00:55:47,036
- Is that a real tornado?
- Fun, huh?

849
00:55:47,136 --> 00:55:48,287
Clovis, focus.

850
00:55:48,387 --> 00:55:50,164
Focus. Bigger. Got you.

851
00:55:50,264 --> 00:55:53,099
Hey, how about something
around that size?

852
00:55:53,267 --> 00:55:54,684
Would that work for you?

853
00:55:59,898 --> 00:56:01,899
What do you mean George made it?

854
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:03,636
George, is that true?

855
00:56:03,736 --> 00:56:04,929
Don't get mad at him.

856
00:56:05,029 --> 00:56:06,612
Mad? No.

857
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:09,907
I think he may have
the answer to your problem.

858
00:56:10,034 --> 00:56:11,518
Good work, George.

859
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:13,604
Clovis, I need to borrow your truck.

860
00:56:13,704 --> 00:56:14,912
My truck?

861
00:56:15,289 --> 00:56:16,789
Thanks, Clove.

862
00:56:17,458 --> 00:56:18,833
Be careful!

863
00:56:19,293 --> 00:56:20,361
What?

864
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:25,006
You left your squeaky toy
in the back of the truck?

865
00:56:25,758 --> 00:56:27,117
- Come on.
- This is taking too long.

866
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:29,703
- Oh, no! What's going on?
- When is this museum gonna start?

867
00:56:29,803 --> 00:56:31,956
There are people lined up
all around the block!

868
00:56:32,056 --> 00:56:33,540
I don't understand, Junior.

869
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:36,293
I thought I told you
to cancel the exhibit.

870
00:56:36,393 --> 00:56:40,980
Me? No, Father, please. I don't think so.
Look, I would have done it.

871
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:45,943
You know, Father, I'm afraid this
has the stink of Ted all over it.

872
00:56:46,070 --> 00:56:47,862
Take a whiff with me.

873
00:56:48,197 --> 00:56:49,655
Yeah.

874
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:51,866
- Hello?
- Mr. Bloomsberry? Ted here.

875
00:56:51,992 --> 00:56:54,035
- Ted?
- How dare... Hang up, Father.

876
00:56:54,161 --> 00:56:56,120
- No, no. No, sir, don't hang up. No.
- Ted, I can't talk.

877
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:58,232
- Please, no. I know.
- This is really not a good time.

878
00:56:58,332 --> 00:56:59,665
I have the solution.

879
00:56:59,792 --> 00:57:02,502
- Solution?
- I'm sorry. Did he say, "solution"?

880
00:57:02,711 --> 00:57:04,488
The exhibit can open as planned.

881
00:57:04,588 --> 00:57:05,948
How is that possible?

882
00:57:06,048 --> 00:57:07,783
Well, I'll explain it when I see you.

883
00:57:07,883 --> 00:57:10,786
All you need to know is,
the eagle has landed.

884
00:57:10,886 --> 00:57:13,080
- The what?
- Did he say, "beagle"?

885
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:16,250
- No, I said, "The eagle has landed."
- Eagle?

886
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:18,043
What about the idol?
Ask him about the idol.

887
00:57:18,143 --> 00:57:19,294
No, the idol would be the eagle.

888
00:57:19,394 --> 00:57:20,421
Ted, start over.

889
00:57:20,521 --> 00:57:22,506
It's not a big deal.
I'll be there in 15 minutes.

890
00:57:22,606 --> 00:57:24,008
Okay, fine. Hurry.

891
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:28,778
The city is my jungle gym

892
00:57:29,947 --> 00:57:34,158
Look at this big great world
That we're living in

893
00:57:35,369 --> 00:57:39,565
There's lots of fun
to be had on these streets

894
00:57:39,665 --> 00:57:43,652
We can take a ride just you and me

895
00:57:43,752 --> 00:57:44,778
It's a jungle gym

896
00:57:44,878 --> 00:57:47,364
Would you get out of the way?
Man on a mission here.

897
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:49,116
Trolley cars and buses, too

898
00:57:49,216 --> 00:57:51,577
All the big kids going to school

899
00:57:51,677 --> 00:57:54,413
I'm going to get a treat
from the ice cream man

900
00:57:54,513 --> 00:57:58,375
I'm seeing multiple violations
of rules of the road!

901
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:00,127
Multiple violations!

902
00:58:00,227 --> 00:58:01,628
The city's nitty gritty

903
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:03,521
But it's so much fun

904
00:58:04,815 --> 00:58:05,966
Oh, yeah.

905
00:58:06,066 --> 00:58:10,137
A 40 foot monkey causing unintentional
widespread panic? Seen it.

906
00:58:10,237 --> 00:58:14,740
Sha la la la la la la la la la

907
00:58:15,117 --> 00:58:19,730
Sha la la la la la la la la la

908
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:23,567
Traffic is crazy. I'm going to
get off Broadway and try Sixth.

909
00:58:23,667 --> 00:58:24,985
It's a funky beat

910
00:58:25,085 --> 00:58:28,171
The more I've learned inside the city

911
00:58:28,589 --> 00:58:32,576
Hey, there are lines painted
on the street for a reason!

912
00:58:33,886 --> 00:58:37,414
Oh, yeah? Well, that's not
physically possible for me to do!

913
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:38,764
So there.

914
00:58:39,141 --> 00:58:42,560
George, take that license-plate
number down, quickly.

915
00:58:45,606 --> 00:58:47,674
The city's nitty-gritty

916
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:51,053
George, what are you thinking?
Tighten your seat belt.

917
00:58:51,153 --> 00:58:53,779
Every nutcase in the city
is on the road today.

918
00:58:55,616 --> 00:58:59,452
Wow, Junior is right.
There is a parking problem in this city.

919
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:03,190
Mr. Bloomsberry! Mr. Bloomsberry!

920
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:05,625
Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no, no.

921
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:07,027
That's it.

922
00:59:07,127 --> 00:59:11,365
Get that little jungle thing out of here
before he destroys something else.

923
00:59:11,465 --> 00:59:14,701
Hold on, there, Son.
Ted, what is this contraption?

924
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:18,846
Stand back, everyone,
and prepare to be amazed.

925
00:59:19,473 --> 00:59:21,083
Oh, yeah. This ought to be good.

926
00:59:21,183 --> 00:59:23,001
Here, George. Let's show them.

927
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:24,310
Small idol.

928
00:59:27,689 --> 00:59:28,966
Big idol.

929
00:59:29,066 --> 00:59:31,067
Isn't that thing awesome?

930
00:59:32,903 --> 00:59:34,388
- What is it?
- I see.

931
00:59:34,488 --> 00:59:36,322
- Daddy, I'm scared.
- Interesting.

932
00:59:36,448 --> 00:59:40,117
- I don't like it.
- We optically enlarge the statue.

933
00:59:40,661 --> 00:59:43,230
Yes, I suppose this might work.

934
00:59:43,330 --> 00:59:45,665
Yes, this will definitely work.

935
00:59:46,041 --> 00:59:48,569
Well, sir, the credit
really should go to George.

936
00:59:48,669 --> 00:59:51,113
He gave me the idea as we were
floating over the city.

937
00:59:51,213 --> 00:59:52,239
Floating?

938
00:59:52,339 --> 00:59:54,324
You know what?
I'll tell you about it some other time.

939
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:55,591
Excuse me.

940
00:59:56,134 --> 00:59:59,512
Hi. Voice of reason.
Like to introduce myself. Hello.

941
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:03,500
Are we so desperate
that we'll lie to our public?

942
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:06,753
Nonsense. We promised the people
something awe-inspiring,

943
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:09,855
and we're giving it to them,
thanks to Ted and George.

944
01:00:10,232 --> 01:00:11,925
I knew you wouldn't let me down.

945
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:14,136
Well, sir, I've got to tell you,
I came pretty close.

946
01:00:14,236 --> 01:00:17,530
No. No, Ted, I am so proud of you.

947
01:00:17,698 --> 01:00:19,657
You're like the son I never had.

948
01:00:20,492 --> 01:00:22,728
Father, I'm your son, remember?

949
01:00:22,828 --> 01:00:24,537
Yes, but I had you.

950
01:00:24,746 --> 01:00:26,106
Ted, this is amazing.

951
01:00:26,206 --> 01:00:29,083
Yes, of course. What was I thinking?

952
01:00:29,293 --> 01:00:33,879
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?
Isn't that cool? Can you believe it?

953
01:00:36,133 --> 01:00:38,092
Hey, monkey. Monkey want a sip?

954
01:00:38,719 --> 01:00:42,054
Go on. Take it. Yummy. Creamy.

955
01:00:43,098 --> 01:00:44,557
Yes. Good. Drink it.

956
01:00:44,933 --> 01:00:48,253
Say, I guess the world didn't need
another parking lot after all.

957
01:00:48,353 --> 01:00:51,089
Hey, you did it.
Another great Ted moment.

958
01:00:51,189 --> 01:00:52,216
Thank you.

959
01:00:52,316 --> 01:00:55,067
We've got nobody to thank but you.

960
01:01:10,751 --> 01:01:12,986
George, what did you do?

961
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:16,005
Oh, Ted, I warned you about that monkey.

962
01:01:16,465 --> 01:01:18,325
You don't give a monkey a latte.

963
01:01:18,425 --> 01:01:21,370
And now he's gone and destroyed
the last chance we had

964
01:01:21,470 --> 01:01:23,679
of saving my father's museum.

965
01:01:24,222 --> 01:01:26,807
It's my father's only museum.

966
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:31,020
What have you done, Ted?
What have you done?

967
01:01:32,272 --> 01:01:35,524
He's right, Ted.
We've just been fooling ourselves.

968
01:01:36,401 --> 01:01:37,928
- It's over.
- Agreed.

969
01:01:38,028 --> 01:01:39,596
But, sir, I still think we could...

970
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:41,947
Ted, I said, it's over.

971
01:01:43,492 --> 01:01:46,660
It's okay, Father. It's okay.
I'm here. Your son.

972
01:01:47,287 --> 01:01:50,331
Your real son. Junior, not Ted.

973
01:01:50,457 --> 01:01:52,583
Yes, Father, you'll be fine.

974
01:02:02,302 --> 01:02:05,471
No, George. You just stay here, okay?

975
01:02:06,473 --> 01:02:08,182
I have to do this.

976
01:02:18,193 --> 01:02:19,527
Excuse me.

977
01:02:23,490 --> 01:02:24,657
I'm...

978
01:02:27,869 --> 01:02:30,704
I'm sorry, everybody.
The museum's closed.

979
01:02:30,914 --> 01:02:31,997
What?

980
01:02:34,709 --> 01:02:36,335
But for how long?

981
01:02:36,795 --> 01:02:37,904
Forever.

982
01:02:38,004 --> 01:02:40,381
But I want to see the giant idol.

983
01:02:40,632 --> 01:02:43,952
There never was one.
It was all a big mistake.

984
01:02:44,052 --> 01:02:46,262
We've been waiting for hours.

985
01:02:48,265 --> 01:02:49,890
This is terrible.

986
01:02:51,393 --> 01:02:52,977
What a rip-off.

987
01:02:59,693 --> 01:03:01,152
I'm so sorry.

988
01:03:05,365 --> 01:03:06,866
I have to go.

989
01:03:07,868 --> 01:03:10,202
I'll be back. I promise.

990
01:03:23,383 --> 01:03:25,327
It's too late to cheer me up.

991
01:03:25,427 --> 01:03:29,472
You think life's just nonstop
fun and games, don't you?

992
01:03:29,723 --> 01:03:33,267
Well, it's not, George.
At least, not for me.

993
01:03:37,772 --> 01:03:40,483
George, please just leave me alone.

994
01:03:41,318 --> 01:03:43,136
You're better off without me.

995
01:03:43,236 --> 01:03:47,573
This is not good, you and me.
You belong in the jungle.

996
01:03:47,908 --> 01:03:51,035
I belong somewhere without a monkey.

997
01:03:51,703 --> 01:03:54,914
I don't want...
I can't have you in my life.

998
01:03:55,415 --> 01:03:56,999
Please, just go.

999
01:03:57,292 --> 01:03:58,959
Do you understand?

1000
01:04:01,254 --> 01:04:04,465
No. Look, monkey, don't follow me.

1001
01:04:07,511 --> 01:04:08,761
Get away.

1002
01:04:11,806 --> 01:04:12,874
Got him!

1003
01:04:12,974 --> 01:04:15,168
Easy. Easy.

1004
01:04:15,268 --> 01:04:16,727
Get the cage ready.

1005
01:04:17,562 --> 01:04:19,271
Careful. He's dangerous.

1006
01:04:19,397 --> 01:04:21,174
Hey, hey, not so rough.

1007
01:04:21,274 --> 01:04:23,427
Stand back, sir. I know he looks cute,

1008
01:04:23,527 --> 01:04:26,513
but this one's supposed
to have teeth like Ginsu knives.

1009
01:04:26,613 --> 01:04:28,515
Yeah, that's right.
This matches the description.

1010
01:04:28,615 --> 01:04:31,268
- Hey, he's getting away.
- All right, all right, I got him. I got him.

1011
01:04:31,368 --> 01:04:33,145
Guys. Guys, could you just take him?

1012
01:04:33,245 --> 01:04:35,355
- Careful. Watch his teeth.
- Please.

1013
01:04:35,455 --> 01:04:37,023
And don't hurt him.

1014
01:04:37,123 --> 01:04:40,402
Relax, little fellow.
Back to Africa with you.

1015
01:04:44,381 --> 01:04:47,758
It's for the best, Ted.
It's for the best.

1016
01:04:55,642 --> 01:04:58,936
And I'll wait here a while

1017
01:05:00,146 --> 01:05:02,982
Just long enough to be

1018
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:06,569
All right, come on. Take it away.

1019
01:05:08,113 --> 01:05:10,656
Didn't make a wrong turn

1020
01:05:11,658 --> 01:05:14,660
And I'll wait long enough

1021
01:05:15,829 --> 01:05:18,664
For maybe an hour or two

1022
01:05:19,833 --> 01:05:22,793
Before I decide

1023
01:05:23,712 --> 01:05:26,281
It wasn't me, it was you

1024
01:05:26,381 --> 01:05:29,159
Peekaboo.

1025
01:05:29,259 --> 01:05:31,468
Aboo. Aboo.

1026
01:05:32,387 --> 01:05:34,722
Peek-a-boo. Peek-a-boo.

1027
01:05:35,974 --> 01:05:38,976
George. He loved peek-a-boo.

1028
01:05:39,269 --> 01:05:40,519
You think he saw us?

1029
01:05:46,526 --> 01:05:50,529
With everything ahead of us
We left everything behind

1030
01:05:51,197 --> 01:05:54,893
Everything we needed
and right at this time

1031
01:05:54,993 --> 01:05:57,828
And now the feeling that
I'm feeling, well

1032
01:05:58,121 --> 01:06:01,582
- It's feeling like my life is finally mine
- Man, what a ride.

1033
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:04,945
Hey! That's mine! Mom!

1034
01:06:05,045 --> 01:06:08,657
If I had a minute
For every hour that I wasted

1035
01:06:08,757 --> 01:06:12,718
I'd be rich in time I'd be doing fine

1036
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:16,414
- Without you I was broken
- Monkey. Monkey. Over here.

1037
01:06:16,514 --> 01:06:18,458
- But I'd rather be broke down
- Come, monkey. Come on.

1038
01:06:18,558 --> 01:06:20,976
- With you by my side
- Here, monkey.

1039
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:25,898
He loved the primary colors.

1040
01:06:26,566 --> 01:06:29,177
Hey! No, no, no, no! That's fresh paint!

1041
01:06:29,277 --> 01:06:31,737
That's fresh paint, sir!
No, no, no, no! Come on.

1042
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:35,157
Yeah. Quitting time.

1043
01:06:41,373 --> 01:06:42,581
George?

1044
01:06:45,627 --> 01:06:47,294
How'd you get out?

1045
01:06:52,342 --> 01:06:53,509
George?

1046
01:06:54,386 --> 01:06:57,262
So that's why traffic was so bad.

1047
01:06:57,639 --> 01:06:59,139
Oh, George.

1048
01:07:00,892 --> 01:07:02,335
Here, give me that!

1049
01:07:02,435 --> 01:07:06,438
Those were some good times.
We had some fun, didn't we?

1050
01:07:08,608 --> 01:07:09,676
Thank you.

1051
01:07:09,776 --> 01:07:11,136
Without you I was broken

1052
01:07:11,236 --> 01:07:14,697
But I'd rather be broke down
with you by my side

1053
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:18,450
Sir, I'm only passing out
flyers, not hugs.

1054
01:07:18,702 --> 01:07:20,994
Ted, I've been looking for you.

1055
01:07:21,496 --> 01:07:23,273
Is everything okay?

1056
01:07:23,373 --> 01:07:24,649
That's what I was thinking.

1057
01:07:24,749 --> 01:07:26,776
- Yeah, sure. Why?
- Why?

1058
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:31,031
Well, you are hugging a man
dressed in a monkey costume.

1059
01:07:31,131 --> 01:07:33,215
Kind of tight, I might add.

1060
01:07:33,466 --> 01:07:38,288
And good luck with that, Phil.
Great to see you again.

1061
01:07:38,388 --> 01:07:42,307
Yeah, you, too. Remember,
the sale ends Thursday.

1062
01:07:43,184 --> 01:07:46,379
So after they took him away,
I've been wandering the streets,

1063
01:07:46,479 --> 01:07:49,549
and you saw me hugging a man
in a monkey outfit.

1064
01:07:49,649 --> 01:07:51,984
That pretty much catches you up.

1065
01:07:52,444 --> 01:07:55,430
I can't believe George is gone,
and it's all my fault.

1066
01:07:55,530 --> 01:07:56,681
Yes, it is.

1067
01:07:56,781 --> 01:07:57,865
What?

1068
01:07:58,032 --> 01:08:01,061
Ted, do you want me to tell you
what you want to hear,

1069
01:08:01,161 --> 01:08:02,979
or do you want to hear
what you should hear,

1070
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:06,915
which I'll tell you, and not just
what you think you want to hear?

1071
01:08:07,208 --> 01:08:08,735
Run that by me one more time.

1072
01:08:08,835 --> 01:08:12,880
George is gone, and I'm afraid
it's your fault he's gone.

1073
01:08:13,173 --> 01:08:16,592
So the question is,
what are you going to do about it?

1074
01:08:20,597 --> 01:08:22,806
You're right. It is my fault.

1075
01:08:23,141 --> 01:08:27,060
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a date with a monkey.

1076
01:08:28,438 --> 01:08:30,757
You know that I don't have
a date with a monkey.

1077
01:08:30,857 --> 01:08:33,426
It was just my way of saying
that I'm going after George.

1078
01:08:33,526 --> 01:08:35,319
- Ted.
- Right. Bye.

1079
01:08:59,052 --> 01:09:00,844
Oh, no! I'm too late.

1080
01:09:02,180 --> 01:09:03,388
Or am I?

1081
01:09:03,723 --> 01:09:07,711
Luckily, movies have taught me
exactly what to do in this situation.

1082
01:09:07,811 --> 01:09:09,937
Kids, don't try this at home.

1083
01:09:12,774 --> 01:09:13,899
Here we go.

1084
01:09:23,535 --> 01:09:27,454
What am I doing?
This isn't a movie. It's real!

1085
01:09:40,260 --> 01:09:41,494
This is odd.

1086
01:09:41,594 --> 01:09:45,264
You guys are a little dressed up for a
cargo ship to Africa, don't you think?

1087
01:09:47,517 --> 01:09:48,600
Oops.

1088
01:09:49,477 --> 01:09:50,811
Excuse me.

1089
01:09:51,729 --> 01:09:53,438
I'm coming for you!

1090
01:10:04,659 --> 01:10:05,868
George!

1091
01:10:06,619 --> 01:10:08,078
George!

1092
01:10:09,330 --> 01:10:10,539
George.

1093
01:10:11,499 --> 01:10:13,250
George.

1094
01:10:23,386 --> 01:10:24,636
George!

1095
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:30,851
Where are you?

1096
01:10:31,352 --> 01:10:33,145
George, are you here?

1097
01:10:34,355 --> 01:10:36,148
I think you're here.

1098
01:10:36,816 --> 01:10:37,983
George?

1099
01:10:43,990 --> 01:10:45,157
George!

1100
01:10:47,452 --> 01:10:48,952
There you are!

1101
01:10:49,370 --> 01:10:51,038
Stand back, buddy!

1102
01:10:55,668 --> 01:10:58,545
George, give me a hug,
you little fur ball!

1103
01:10:59,005 --> 01:11:01,506
There. You're all right.

1104
01:11:01,758 --> 01:11:04,468
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1105
01:11:05,136 --> 01:11:09,348
I don't know how I let them
take you away. I mean, I do.

1106
01:11:11,184 --> 01:11:15,562
This was so important to me,
but somehow it just doesn't matter anymore.

1107
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:20,359
What matters is you and me,
buddy, our buddyship.

1108
01:11:20,777 --> 01:11:24,305
Now we can do all the monkey things
we've always wanted to do.

1109
01:11:24,405 --> 01:11:28,200
I'll get an organ and grind,
and you can dance for money.

1110
01:11:28,368 --> 01:11:31,479
Or I can dance for money. Who knows?

1111
01:11:31,579 --> 01:11:33,914
We'll figure it out. We can take turns.

1112
01:11:34,207 --> 01:11:37,443
George, do you mind?
I'm expressing some feelings here.

1113
01:11:37,543 --> 01:11:39,544
It's kind of hard, okay?

1114
01:11:39,671 --> 01:11:42,673
Now, where was I?
Right, who's going to dance.

1115
01:11:43,466 --> 01:11:47,579
Oh, no, no. Adventure!
You brought adventure to my life.

1116
01:11:47,679 --> 01:11:51,682
And now, you know,
that's all that matters.

1117
01:11:55,979 --> 01:11:58,271
Wait. Where's that coming from?

1118
01:11:59,148 --> 01:12:00,774
It's a pictogram.

1119
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:06,238
George, it's the map!

1120
01:12:06,781 --> 01:12:08,657
We had it all along.

1121
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:11,477
Of course.

1122
01:12:11,577 --> 01:12:15,080
"Turn your eye to the light.
Go from blindness to sight."

1123
01:12:15,498 --> 01:12:18,625
I was supposed to hold
the statue up to the sun.

1124
01:12:20,586 --> 01:12:24,741
Pack your things, George.
We're off to Africa on the very next ship.

1125
01:12:26,926 --> 01:12:29,761
Wait a minute.
We're already on a ship to Africa.

1126
01:12:30,430 --> 01:12:32,305
Man, what a time saver.

1127
01:12:40,273 --> 01:12:42,274
Okay, Edu. I got it.

1128
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:49,781
That's it! You did it,
George! Give me five!

1129
01:12:51,451 --> 01:12:53,243
That's close enough.

1130
01:12:55,038 --> 01:12:56,788
Well done, Mr. Ted.

1131
01:12:56,914 --> 01:12:59,400
- This way, men! Follow me.
- Right away.

1132
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:00,860
The guy in yellow.

1133
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:02,002
Let's go.

1134
01:13:16,601 --> 01:13:18,711
Here I am.
Please, valet at your service.

1135
01:13:18,811 --> 01:13:20,937
- We've been waiting.
- Sorry.

1136
01:13:21,147 --> 01:13:23,883
The nearest parking lot
is five blocks away.

1137
01:13:23,983 --> 01:13:27,903
I know. I own that parking lot.
That's where the real money is.

1138
01:13:28,154 --> 01:13:29,305
I know.

1139
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:36,244
Behold the Eighth Wonder of the World!

1140
01:13:37,330 --> 01:13:41,291
The Lost Shrine of Zagawa!

1141
01:13:47,673 --> 01:13:50,342
Okay, now that, I haven't seen.

1142
01:13:50,968 --> 01:13:52,469
But now I've seen it.

1143
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:56,473
Way to go, Mr. Ted!

1144
01:13:59,769 --> 01:14:04,022
As I stand in front of
the Lost Idol of Zagawa...

1145
01:14:06,067 --> 01:14:09,402
I just have one important thing to say.

1146
01:14:09,779 --> 01:14:12,306
Anyone can memorize facts and figures.

1147
01:14:12,406 --> 01:14:15,351
The real way to learn anything
is to go out and experience it,

1148
01:14:15,451 --> 01:14:17,812
and let your curiosity lead you.

1149
01:14:17,912 --> 01:14:18,980
Oh, George.

1150
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:20,273
- Hi.
- Hey, it's George.

1151
01:14:20,373 --> 01:14:22,374
So who's ready to learn?

1152
01:14:24,919 --> 01:14:26,878
Wow, it's beautiful.

1153
01:14:27,547 --> 01:14:30,450
- Remarkable.
- I've never seen anything like it.

1154
01:14:30,550 --> 01:14:31,591
It's gorgeous.

1155
01:14:34,762 --> 01:14:37,347
Come on. This way. Don't be shy.

1156
01:14:41,894 --> 01:14:44,729
Oh, this is so exhilarating.

1157
01:14:45,148 --> 01:14:49,442
You know, Timmy, I have
an original George in my penthouse.

1158
01:14:50,611 --> 01:14:53,890
Wow, that looks just like... Ivan!

1159
01:14:53,990 --> 01:14:55,073
Wait.

1160
01:14:56,117 --> 01:14:58,743
Ted! Ted! Over here.

1161
01:14:59,078 --> 01:15:01,230
There you are, 17-B.

1162
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:03,483
Boy, you're light
on your feet for a big man.

1163
01:15:03,583 --> 01:15:07,487
I must admit, your monkey
shows real talent.

1164
01:15:07,587 --> 01:15:08,613
Quite the artist.

1165
01:15:08,713 --> 01:15:11,157
So I am taking back
kickinging you from building.

1166
01:15:11,257 --> 01:15:14,092
- Oh, that's great, Ivan.
- No hard feelings.

1167
01:15:14,552 --> 01:15:17,095
Oh, Georgie, you're just so cute.

1168
01:15:18,097 --> 01:15:19,264
I think he likes me.

1169
01:15:19,432 --> 01:15:21,084
- Right over there.
- Thanks, Mr. Bloomsberry.

1170
01:15:21,184 --> 01:15:24,269
- I parked all the cars, Father.
- Good job, Son.

1171
01:15:24,854 --> 01:15:26,938
Really? A good job.

1172
01:15:27,356 --> 01:15:30,384
Oh, Father. Oh, Father. Hug time.

1173
01:15:30,484 --> 01:15:32,386
- There, there, my boy.
- Hug your son.

1174
01:15:32,486 --> 01:15:34,597
- It's okay. It's okay.
- Tighter. Yes.

1175
01:15:34,697 --> 01:15:35,947
- Daddy's here.
- Hold me.

1176
01:15:36,449 --> 01:15:37,683
Good job, sweetheart.

1177
01:15:37,783 --> 01:15:39,951
Wow, George. You are so fast!

1178
01:15:40,786 --> 01:15:42,230
What is that?

1179
01:15:42,330 --> 01:15:47,083
I'm not one to brag,
but I call it The Magnificator.

1180
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:49,502
That's so cool.

1181
01:15:49,795 --> 01:15:51,213
Say, have you seen Sparky?

1182
01:15:51,714 --> 01:15:53,491
I found a rib bone.

1183
01:15:53,591 --> 01:15:54,951
I found a femur.

1184
01:15:55,051 --> 01:15:57,636
I found... Sparky.

1185
01:15:57,762 --> 01:16:00,873
And I am happy to say
that because of Ted...

1186
01:16:00,973 --> 01:16:03,209
Sir, George, don't forget George.

1187
01:16:03,309 --> 01:16:04,877
And George, of course.

1188
01:16:04,977 --> 01:16:07,338
We are not going anywhere.

1189
01:16:07,438 --> 01:16:11,066
The Bloomsberry Museum is here to stay.

1190
01:16:31,045 --> 01:16:34,115
All right, all right, last question.

1191
01:16:34,215 --> 01:16:37,243
Ted, where will you and George
go for your next adventure?

1192
01:16:37,343 --> 01:16:40,011
The Arctic? South America? Egypt?

1193
01:16:41,055 --> 01:16:44,792
You know, you don't need to go around
the world for a great adventure.

1194
01:16:44,892 --> 01:16:47,920
I have a lot of things
to catch up on right here.

1195
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:49,797
- Really?
- Really.

1196
01:16:49,897 --> 01:16:51,507
Mister, George is...

1197
01:16:51,607 --> 01:16:54,067
I know, he's cute. Lovable.

1198
01:16:54,193 --> 01:16:56,486
Very cute. Very lovable.

1199
01:16:56,696 --> 01:16:59,515
Yeah, well, he's also in that rocket.

1200
01:16:59,615 --> 01:17:02,268
It's okay. There's no fuel in it.

1201
01:17:07,373 --> 01:17:10,667
Clovis, you didn't put fuel
in that rocket, did you?

1202
01:17:11,711 --> 01:17:12,877
Maybe.

1203
01:17:13,796 --> 01:17:15,907
- Oh, no.
- I see a rocket with empty fuel tanks,

1204
01:17:16,007 --> 01:17:17,257
what am I supposed to do?

1205
01:17:19,844 --> 01:17:21,303
George, wait!

1206
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:23,831
- Bye.
- See you, Ted.

1207
01:17:23,931 --> 01:17:25,625
- Look at all the smoke.
- No hard feelings, huh?

1208
01:17:25,725 --> 01:17:27,892
Careful, Ted! Hurry back!

1209
01:17:28,978 --> 01:17:32,465
Okay, but once around the Earth
and then straight home.

1210
01:17:32,565 --> 01:17:34,774
Do you hear me? Okay?
I've got plans tonight.

1211
01:17:43,409 --> 01:17:44,492
Gosh.

1212
01:17:45,244 --> 01:17:47,480
No, no, no, George,
I'm not letting you drive.

1213
01:17:47,580 --> 01:17:48,564
Just sit back and...

1214
01:17:48,664 --> 01:17:51,484
No, George. Don't push that button.
I don't know what it does.

1215
01:17:51,584 --> 01:17:52,860
George, don't...

1216
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:55,754
Hold on, George! Oh, boy!

1217
01:17:56,130 --> 01:17:58,324
That is a surge of adrenaline.

1218
01:17:58,424 --> 01:18:00,133
I'm going to sleep good tonight.
