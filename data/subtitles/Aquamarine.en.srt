1
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:13,031
Hello.

2
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,689
Look at him, Claire.

3
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:29,441
I'm looking at him, Hailey.

4
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:33,529
Sitting up there being gorgeous,
looking for someone to rescue.

5
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:36,949
He should so be rescuing us.
What's wrong with this picture?

6
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:41,161
Well, all these articles say
we've been way too available.

7
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:42,871
We need to be more coy.

8
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,624
We're so coy
he barely knows we exist.

9
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:47,876
Okay. Ray pop quiz.

10
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:51,672
Favorite song? Favorite food?
Favorite drink? Go, go, go.

11
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:54,091
Weezer's "Island in the Sun. "

12
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:56,552
-Dr Pepper. Oranges?
-Very nice.

13
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:59,263
-I'm trying to read.
-Fine.

14
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:02,391
Then read me
the latest on boy-bagging technology.

15
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:05,644
Oh, okay. This one's called
"Fluff and Retreat. "

16
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:09,857
"Fluff his ego, then walk away.
Not only is he left wanting more...

17
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:12,776
...but he's under the impression
that it's his idea. "

18
00:03:12,985 --> 00:03:15,904
-Nice.
-That's really cool.

19
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:22,160
Summer's almost over
and you haven't gone in the water once.

20
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:24,329
Once would be way too many times.

21
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,124
Excuse me.

22
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:30,961
Do you realize we've got less than
five days until you have to move?

23
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:33,505
I don't want you moving
halfway around the world.

24
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:36,049
Claire, you're such a ruiner.

25
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,969
I'd gone, like, a half-hour
without thinking about it.

26
00:03:39,178 --> 00:03:42,347
-Hailey, I'm sorry but...
-Besides, I haven't kissed Raymond yet.

27
00:03:43,182 --> 00:03:45,350
So I'm not going anywhere.

28
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:48,604
Incoming.

29
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:54,693
-Hello, hottie.
-It's Raymond.

30
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,448
Hail, did you order a sand-witch?

31
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:02,075
Cecilia's back from camp.

32
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:04,828
Don't worry. He won't fall for yuck.

33
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:06,872
He's way too smart for that.

34
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:09,500
-Hey, Cecilia.
-Hey.

35
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:17,549
Whoa.

36
00:04:19,343 --> 00:04:20,802
Did they get...

37
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:22,346
...bigger?

38
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:23,931
She could poke an eye out.

39
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:26,600
We just...
We have to decode his body language.

40
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:29,937
Look, it's fine.
I mean, if he's into her...

41
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:34,066
...he'll shake his hair, stretch his arms,
and flex those muscles.

42
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,651
Yeah?

43
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:39,655
-What was that?
-Fingers. Fingers through the hair.

44
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:42,533
I mean, technically,
that wasn't shaking.

45
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:44,284
Right?

46
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:49,665
Please, gods of love, no shake.

47
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,416
No stretch. No flex. No...

48
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,585
-No...
-No, no...

49
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:57,256
No.

50
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:00,425
-You guys okay?
-Yeah, we're fine.

51
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:03,053
-Thanks. We're good.
-Yeah, thanks.

52
00:05:06,557 --> 00:05:08,100
Babysit much?

53
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:10,269
I can't take it anymore.

54
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:12,980
As long as he doesn't flip
his sunglasses we're fine.

55
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:15,148
Hey, Ray, think fast.

56
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:18,360
-I can't look anymore. You.
-Sorry.

57
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:21,655
-I figured you could catch.
-You're right.

58
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:24,950
What? Did he flip them?

59
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,077
It's really sunny out.
It doesn't count.

60
00:05:27,286 --> 00:05:28,579
Yeah.

61
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:33,250
-Say something.
-You'll never tan in those clothes.

62
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:38,046
-Or skin cancer.
-Please. We don't even smoke.

63
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,842
Such losers.

64
00:05:42,134 --> 00:05:43,969
The perfect end to a perfect day.

65
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:45,929
Claire. Hailey. We need your help.

66
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:53,979
Hey.

67
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:58,984
-What?
-Oh, we've decided to fire Raymond.

68
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:00,861
-What?
-What?

69
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,989
-No. No, you can't.
-No. No.

70
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:10,037
-You should've seen your faces.
-That is so not funny.

71
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:12,706
Oh, you girls, you're too wound up.

72
00:06:12,915 --> 00:06:15,792
Now, help bring in the Last Splash
decorations, please.

73
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:17,920
Weatherman says
a big storm's coming.

74
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:22,174
-We'll put them up again after it clears.
-Ray will still be there when you're done.

75
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,717
Grandpa.

76
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:26,553
Oh, supper's at 6, Claire.

77
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:28,472
You'll come back
after dinner, right?

78
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,600
-We can hang out in the rec room...
-No. I have other plans.

79
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,894
What?
But you promised...

80
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:37,231
-God, chill out. Your grandma's right.
-Hailey, I'm so...

81
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:40,150
-Sorry.
-Jeez, Leonard.

82
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:44,863
M or W?

83
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:50,994
Right. Nice to see you too.

84
00:06:52,788 --> 00:06:54,665
W.

85
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:01,839
He knows what you did last summer.

86
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:16,979
Get...

87
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:24,987
-Mom, I'm home.
-Hey, kiddo.

88
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:28,824
Hailey, your boxes
won't pack themselves.

89
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:32,452
Don't put this off
until the movers come.

90
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:43,589
Come on, Moby. Don't play me like that.
I haven't seen you in days.

91
00:07:44,006 --> 00:07:47,926
Hailey, you can unpack as much
as you want. We're still moving.

92
00:07:48,594 --> 00:07:50,095
Yeah.

93
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:54,349
How was the club?

94
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:57,102
Maybe I could get more
than one syllable this time.

95
00:07:57,311 --> 00:07:58,604
It was fine.

96
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,689
That was three.

97
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,820
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

98
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:12,075
But you didn't want to leave Boston
either, remember?

99
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:16,121
And look what happened.
You met Claire.

100
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:20,501
You know, Australia could be
another amazing adventure for us, Hails.

101
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:28,258
-How about we start packing your room?
-How about I live here until I'm 18?

102
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:31,553
How about we go back
to fewer syllables?

103
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:34,181
Cool.

104
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:37,518
That was one.

105
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:45,484
<i>A storm warning
is in...</i>

106
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:49,071
So that's where Cecilia Banks gets
all the drama. Just look at her dad.

107
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,490
<i>Well, as you can see... Huh.</i>

108
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:55,536
Hailey, how am I supposed to face
eighth grade without you?

109
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:57,996
My locker is right next
to the boys' bathroom.

110
00:08:58,205 --> 00:09:00,415
And I have co-ed PE class by myself.

111
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:02,751
We have to dance
with Raymond at Last Splash.

112
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:07,089
We'll be such great dancers that he'll
realize that he has to marry one of us.

113
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:09,591
And we'll be so happy
that one of us got him...

114
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,219
...that we won't even be jealous.
You know?

115
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:15,639
Unless he picks you.
That wouldn't be okay.

116
00:09:15,848 --> 00:09:18,100
-Joke.
-What if this is our last camp-out?

117
00:09:19,101 --> 00:09:20,936
What if this is it?

118
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:25,524
Oh, gods of hurricanes...

119
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:29,111
...makers of thunder and lightning
and majestical waves...

120
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:32,531
...useth your power to keep my mom
from moving to Australia.

121
00:09:32,948 --> 00:09:35,492
Maketh her to see
the error of her ways...

122
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:39,204
...and keepeth us in Bay Bridge.

123
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:43,834
Ameneth.

124
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:47,462
-You're insane.
-That's what they tell me.

125
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:49,298
Yeah.

126
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:53,969
Ameneth.

127
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:02,311
Oh, my God.
The vending machine's possessed.

128
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:06,148
-Looks like we got free...
-Hailey!

129
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:08,817
...soda?
-Where are you? You dead? Don't die.

130
00:10:09,026 --> 00:10:11,778
I'm not dead. I'm right here.
Follow my voice.

131
00:10:11,987 --> 00:10:15,032
Oh, God. Something's out there.

132
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:19,536
Claire, I want you to know
that if Leonard comes...

133
00:10:19,745 --> 00:10:21,622
...and chops us
into a million pieces...

134
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:26,043
...then you are totally, completely
and eternally my best friend.

135
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:29,004
You're my best friend too.

136
00:10:29,213 --> 00:10:31,840
And I broke your iPod.

137
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:42,601
What are you girls doing out here
in this weather? Come on.

138
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,144
Grandma, you scared me.

139
00:10:44,353 --> 00:10:46,438
Let's get the two of you
tucked up in bed.

140
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:49,483
Mrs. B., if I have nightmares
tonight, I'm blaming you.

141
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:03,455
<i>Oh, gods of hurricanes, makers of
thunder and lightning...</i>

142
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:07,042
<i>-Gods of hurricanes...
-Just take me now.</i>

143
00:11:07,376 --> 00:11:10,212
<i>Oh, gods of hurricanes, makers of
thunder and lightning...</i>

144
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,005
<i>...and majestical waves.</i>

145
00:11:12,214 --> 00:11:16,093
<i>Please useth your powers
to keep my mom...</i>

146
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:22,224
<i>Maketh her to see the error of her ways
and keepeth us in Bay Bridge.</i>

147
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:50,669
Oh, my God.

148
00:11:52,421 --> 00:11:54,965
-Come on, men.
-On three. You ready? One, two, three.

149
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:57,384
Raymond's out. Come on.

150
00:11:57,593 --> 00:11:59,219
Yeah, bring it up.

151
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:04,141
-He's beautiful. Okay. Stay calm.
-Come on.

152
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:07,394
-I'll catch you later, man.
-Yeah, catch you later.

153
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:19,031
Look at this.

154
00:12:21,325 --> 00:12:25,078
-What a wreck.
-It's Ray. Don't look. Get down.

155
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:27,539
Hello, little freaky blue crab.

156
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:32,211
Claire, look.

157
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:35,797
Ray. Hope you're ready to clean.

158
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:40,135
Think you'll call off Last Splash?

159
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:43,555
-No. No, Mr. B.
-No. Grandpa, no...

160
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:45,474
Mr. B., I'm sorry,
you can't do that.

161
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:48,644
Mr. B., we have been
planning for this for, like, ever.

162
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:52,481
-It'll be all right.
-Grandpa? Are the pool lights still on?

163
00:13:00,906 --> 00:13:02,199
Claire.

164
00:13:33,689 --> 00:13:35,858
-Hold on.
-There's a shark in the pool.

165
00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:37,484
I got you. You're okay.

166
00:13:37,693 --> 00:13:39,194
Here, somebody get a chair.

167
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:42,698
Calm down. There you go.
She may be in shock.

168
00:13:43,073 --> 00:13:44,741
-Take deep breaths.
-You all right?

169
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:48,245
She gets scared in the water.
Her parents drowned.

170
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:51,248
-You all right, honey?
-I saw something.

171
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:54,459
It's in there, and...
I don't know what it was.

172
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:56,920
Half the ocean washed up
in there last night.

173
00:13:57,129 --> 00:13:59,089
Hailey, take Claire inside.

174
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:01,550
Leonard? Lock up the patio.

175
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:05,888
-I don't want anyone else falling in.
-Okay. Clean it, lock it, got it.

176
00:14:06,305 --> 00:14:08,015
That was tight, Ray.

177
00:14:10,642 --> 00:14:12,186
Thanks, Ray.

178
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:17,691
Well, come on.

179
00:14:17,941 --> 00:14:20,569
My God. Raymond totally
jumped in there to save you...

180
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:22,779
...with his actual biceps.

181
00:14:22,988 --> 00:14:25,574
Did you feel them around you?
Were they flexed?

182
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:28,035
Oh, God, they must have been flexed.

183
00:14:28,243 --> 00:14:31,538
If you had stopped breathing,
you were this close to mouth-to-mouth.

184
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:33,916
There's something in there.
I'm serious.

185
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:36,293
It looked like...
I can't even say it. But...

186
00:14:37,211 --> 00:14:40,088
...I swear, it just stared at me
with its eyes.

187
00:14:40,297 --> 00:14:41,632
You're in shock...

188
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:43,300
...from touching Raymond.

189
00:14:44,468 --> 00:14:46,887
Hailey, I know what I saw.

190
00:14:48,472 --> 00:14:52,768
Fine. Then we'll just go back
when no one's looking and check it out.

191
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:56,021
No way. I didn't mean
to get in the water in the first place...

192
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:59,942
...and I'm not going back there again.
Something bad could've happened.

193
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,485
Come on, Clairedy Cat.

194
00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:05,489
Put on your big-girl pants
and meet me at 9:00.

195
00:15:10,953 --> 00:15:14,248
Be careful.
Gram will be super mad at us.

196
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:20,337
It's Leonard.

197
00:15:31,223 --> 00:15:32,641
Come on.

198
00:15:51,827 --> 00:15:54,913
Hey, maybe we should
get fishing poles or something.

199
00:15:55,539 --> 00:15:58,542
No. I don't want to catch it.
I want to feed it.

200
00:16:07,426 --> 00:16:11,180
-Fish sticks?
-Maybe it was an octopus.

201
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:14,308
With blue hair and a tail?

202
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:18,187
It could've been blue seaweed,
or kelp.

203
00:16:18,437 --> 00:16:20,814
It was not an octopus
and it wasn't kelp.

204
00:16:21,023 --> 00:16:22,733
-You want one?
-I saw hair.

205
00:16:22,941 --> 00:16:24,318
God.

206
00:16:25,152 --> 00:16:28,071
If you're gonna ignore every word I say
I can hang out alone.

207
00:16:28,238 --> 00:16:29,281
I'm not ignoring you.

208
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:33,368
-I doubt myself. Don't doubt me too.
-You're getting hysterical over nothing.

209
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:35,162
I bet I know what it was.

210
00:16:38,874 --> 00:16:40,667
I'm guessing...

211
00:16:40,876 --> 00:16:42,878
...it was a mermaid.

212
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:07,736
Boo.

213
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,576
It's a...

214
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:17,621
You're a...

215
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:19,373
A... a mer...

216
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:22,960
I can see we have to take this slowly.

217
00:17:23,168 --> 00:17:25,629
Mer-maid.

218
00:17:26,213 --> 00:17:28,131
Mermaid.

219
00:17:28,966 --> 00:17:32,261
Fabled marine creature,
half woman, half fish...

220
00:17:32,553 --> 00:17:35,180
...known for sitting on rocks,
staring into mirrors...

221
00:17:35,389 --> 00:17:38,225
...and obsessively combing
our long, beautiful hair.

222
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:40,519
Blah, blah, blah.

223
00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:43,230
Wha...? What is going on?

224
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,111
Stop shrieking like a couple of gulls.

225
00:17:50,404 --> 00:17:53,198
For shrimps, you're awfully loud.

226
00:17:54,116 --> 00:17:55,826
-You speak English?
-Yeah.

227
00:17:56,034 --> 00:17:59,955
Mermaids speak every language
known to man, fish, crustacean...

228
00:18:00,164 --> 00:18:02,207
...and several varieties of seafowl.

229
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:04,251
What can you speak?

230
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:06,879
I got a C in Spanish.

231
00:18:09,173 --> 00:18:11,175
Wait. What if she's, like...

232
00:18:11,383 --> 00:18:13,719
...bad or something?
-Why would she be bad?

233
00:18:14,052 --> 00:18:16,346
She's a fictional sea creature.

234
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:19,266
-They could be bad.
-We are not fictional.

235
00:18:19,474 --> 00:18:20,851
We're discrete.

236
00:18:26,857 --> 00:18:29,568
I've never been this close
to a human before.

237
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:32,571
Yeah. Must be weird for you.

238
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:38,827
What?

239
00:18:40,662 --> 00:18:42,289
Nothing.

240
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:44,291
You're staring at my tail.

241
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,503
-Well, yeah, I was.
-Do you...

242
00:18:47,711 --> 00:18:49,505
...want to touch it?

243
00:18:50,923 --> 00:18:52,633
Okay.

244
00:18:56,386 --> 00:18:58,430
It's slimy.

245
00:18:58,639 --> 00:19:02,851
Thank you. I rub it with kelp
and jellyfish twice a day.

246
00:19:15,239 --> 00:19:16,740
Please don't eat us.

247
00:19:16,949 --> 00:19:18,575
The thought.

248
00:19:19,034 --> 00:19:21,662
-It's okay.
-I want to see what feet feel like.

249
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:23,205
Give it.

250
00:19:24,957 --> 00:19:26,834
Can you pick things up with them?

251
00:19:27,751 --> 00:19:30,337
No, but, I can kick with them
if you don't let go.

252
00:19:33,423 --> 00:19:35,384
Hey, get back here.

253
00:19:43,934 --> 00:19:45,477
How did you do that?

254
00:19:46,228 --> 00:19:48,772
Oh, that's nothing.
You should see my father.

255
00:19:48,981 --> 00:19:50,983
He can make some serious waves.

256
00:19:51,191 --> 00:19:54,570
-Like last night, for example.
-Your dad made those waves?

257
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:56,613
Yeah.

258
00:19:56,822 --> 00:19:59,283
He's mad at me because
I swam away from home...

259
00:19:59,491 --> 00:20:02,870
...three days before I'm supposed
to get married off to this merman...

260
00:20:03,078 --> 00:20:05,289
...who's about as deep as a tidal pool.

261
00:20:05,497 --> 00:20:06,999
-Hey.
-Leonard. We have to go.

262
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:08,792
He's a psycho. You have to hide.

263
00:20:09,001 --> 00:20:11,170
-Where are you going?
-We'll be back tomorrow.

264
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:12,880
-Promise?
-Promise.

265
00:20:13,088 --> 00:20:14,798
-Someone over there?
-Come on.

266
00:20:15,007 --> 00:20:16,466
Don't get seen.

267
00:20:58,258 --> 00:21:01,261
Hailey. Hailey, wake up.

268
00:21:12,397 --> 00:21:14,858
What in the world?

269
00:21:15,067 --> 00:21:16,777
Oh, no.

270
00:21:19,238 --> 00:21:22,866
-This is bad. This is so bad.
-Come on.

271
00:21:27,913 --> 00:21:29,414
What have you done?

272
00:21:30,249 --> 00:21:33,544
-I drained the pool.
-She's not in there.

273
00:21:33,752 --> 00:21:36,129
-But how could she get out?
-I don't know.

274
00:21:37,881 --> 00:21:39,591
Come on.

275
00:21:51,395 --> 00:21:54,606
Oh, it's you.
You scared the salt out of me.

276
00:21:54,815 --> 00:21:58,318
I thought you were that man
with that awful sucking machine.

277
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:02,447
-I just about got turned inside out.
-How did you get in here?

278
00:22:02,656 --> 00:22:04,283
I used these.

279
00:22:09,621 --> 00:22:11,331
My very own pair.

280
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:15,752
Oh, and check this out.

281
00:22:20,757 --> 00:22:23,010
-Wow.
-Isn't it cute?

282
00:22:23,844 --> 00:22:26,847
-Very cute.
-And I can sit on it.

283
00:22:27,639 --> 00:22:30,225
Hey, we gotta get you out.
Come on. You'll be seen.

284
00:22:30,642 --> 00:22:34,146
-Give her your t-shirt.
-No. My bathing suit's like boy-repellent.

285
00:22:34,354 --> 00:22:36,773
-What if we see Raymond?
-It's your bathing suit...

286
00:22:36,982 --> 00:22:38,901
...or her birthday suit.
Come on.

287
00:22:40,736 --> 00:22:42,571
Stop.

288
00:22:57,377 --> 00:23:00,422
Oh, no. That's not what you do.
You have to...

289
00:23:00,631 --> 00:23:03,050
-Put your arms there.
-Put your arms through them.

290
00:23:08,388 --> 00:23:10,849
-That looks amazing.
-I know.

291
00:23:21,235 --> 00:23:25,405
I don't understand how you can sleep
on these when they're so jumpy.

292
00:23:25,614 --> 00:23:27,407
I could just do this all day.

293
00:23:27,616 --> 00:23:29,493
Claire, what on earth
are you doing?

294
00:23:32,913 --> 00:23:36,750
You really need to stop.
Gram is gonna be really mad at us.

295
00:23:37,167 --> 00:23:38,794
We're gonna get in huge trouble.

296
00:23:39,002 --> 00:23:41,505
-You worry too much.
-I rest my case.

297
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:43,549
This is so much fun.

298
00:23:45,926 --> 00:23:47,845
I love legs.

299
00:23:48,053 --> 00:23:50,889
So, do you get to keep them?

300
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:53,392
We can only have legs
when the sun's out.

301
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,562
We have to keep them dry.
Or at least that's what I've heard.

302
00:23:56,728 --> 00:23:58,605
I've never had the guts
to try them.

303
00:23:58,814 --> 00:24:00,816
So this is your first time ashore?

304
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:03,610
First time on land.
First time with legs.

305
00:24:03,819 --> 00:24:06,363
-Can you believe it?
-You'd never know.

306
00:24:06,864 --> 00:24:11,076
But I got to be careful.
Add moonlight or water, instant tail.

307
00:24:11,285 --> 00:24:13,162
Look what I can do.

308
00:24:13,662 --> 00:24:15,164
Stop that.

309
00:24:23,005 --> 00:24:25,174
Crabs. They found me.

310
00:24:25,382 --> 00:24:26,925
With a shell?

311
00:24:28,051 --> 00:24:29,803
You can hear
the ocean through these.

312
00:24:30,012 --> 00:24:31,555
Yeah, but...

313
00:24:31,763 --> 00:24:33,974
Well, it works both ways.

314
00:24:34,183 --> 00:24:35,934
The ocean can hear you too.

315
00:24:38,228 --> 00:24:39,563
Hello? Dad?

316
00:24:39,771 --> 00:24:41,982
<i>Aquamarine,
what do you think you're doing?</i>

317
00:24:42,191 --> 00:24:44,651
-Daddy...
-Shell phone.

318
00:24:45,861 --> 00:24:47,404
Could you give me a minute?

319
00:24:47,946 --> 00:24:49,364
Sure. Sorry.

320
00:24:49,573 --> 00:24:51,617
Well, that's your plan, not mine.

321
00:24:51,825 --> 00:24:56,497
I don't want to marry
some spoiled, rich squid.

322
00:24:56,705 --> 00:25:00,375
Well, you can make all the storms
you want, but I'm not coming back.

323
00:25:02,461 --> 00:25:05,797
No, love is not a myth, Daddy.
It's real.

324
00:25:06,173 --> 00:25:09,301
-You think her dad is doing this?
-In three days, I'll prove it.

325
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:12,221
If I'm wrong,
then I will honor your plans.

326
00:25:12,429 --> 00:25:16,433
And I'll call you every night, okay,
so calm down.

327
00:25:24,399 --> 00:25:25,817
I have to find love.

328
00:25:26,026 --> 00:25:30,781
We don't have it where I'm from.
If I can't find it in three days, I'm sunk.

329
00:25:30,989 --> 00:25:34,701
-You don't have love?
-No. My dad says it's just a myth.

330
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:36,453
We marry who our parents pick...

331
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:40,165
...and my dad thinks I have bubbles
in my brain because I believe in love.

332
00:25:40,624 --> 00:25:42,876
The only way
I can get out of my wedding...

333
00:25:43,043 --> 00:25:45,546
...is if I can prove to him
that love exists.

334
00:25:45,754 --> 00:25:47,714
But that means
I only get three days.

335
00:25:48,382 --> 00:25:50,551
Or else I'll be swimming
down the aisle with...

336
00:25:51,552 --> 00:25:52,886
...that blowfish.

337
00:25:53,053 --> 00:25:55,639
But if you don't have love,
how do you know it exists?

338
00:25:55,848 --> 00:25:58,934
I saw it once. And I want it.

339
00:26:03,647 --> 00:26:05,399
With him.

340
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:17,077
-Raymond?
-Check it out.

341
00:26:18,412 --> 00:26:19,788
Raymond?

342
00:26:20,247 --> 00:26:21,748
Raymond.

343
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:33,927
Raymond is the one I love.

344
00:26:34,136 --> 00:26:36,138
No!

345
00:26:36,722 --> 00:26:39,057
No!

346
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:46,023
Raymond. Raymond.

347
00:26:46,231 --> 00:26:47,816
-Raymond.
-Yeah.

348
00:26:48,025 --> 00:26:50,819
-Hi.
-Hi.

349
00:26:52,738 --> 00:26:54,072
Do you love me?

350
00:26:57,367 --> 00:27:01,622
No, but, I think you're hot.
Really hot.

351
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:04,416
Come on, we gotta go.
The Beach House is going off.

352
00:27:04,583 --> 00:27:05,959
Yeah, I know, I know, I know.

353
00:27:06,126 --> 00:27:08,629
Well, I'll see you later.

354
00:27:08,837 --> 00:27:11,006
Come on.
Come on, come on, come on.

355
00:27:11,215 --> 00:27:15,427
-Come on.
-Hey, drop me off at home, can you?

356
00:27:20,307 --> 00:27:22,100
He doesn't love me?

357
00:27:22,309 --> 00:27:26,104
How can he not love me?
I need some salt.

358
00:27:26,313 --> 00:27:28,732
-What did you say?
-He said I was hot.

359
00:27:28,941 --> 00:27:31,109
But, how would he know?

360
00:27:31,318 --> 00:27:32,986
Do I feel hot to you?

361
00:27:34,238 --> 00:27:36,281
No, what he meant
is not how you took it.

362
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:38,575
Help me get him
to fall in love with me.

363
00:27:38,784 --> 00:27:41,620
-Yeah, right.
-No, no, no. Raymond's way too popular.

364
00:27:41,787 --> 00:27:44,748
-You should pick someone else.
-All the girls are after him.

365
00:27:44,998 --> 00:27:46,458
-Even a few boys.
-Right.

366
00:27:46,917 --> 00:27:48,377
Fine.

367
00:27:48,544 --> 00:27:50,462
Then you don't get your wish.

368
00:27:50,671 --> 00:27:52,130
-What?
-Wish? Wait, wait.

369
00:27:52,297 --> 00:27:54,716
-What?
-What wish?

370
00:27:54,925 --> 00:27:58,011
Oh, you know.
If you help a mermaid, you get a wish.

371
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:00,097
Any wish you could wish for.

372
00:28:00,305 --> 00:28:01,807
I thought that was genies.

373
00:28:03,976 --> 00:28:05,394
You believe in genies?

374
00:28:08,063 --> 00:28:12,109
What if our wish
involves other people?

375
00:28:12,317 --> 00:28:13,986
Like my mom.

376
00:28:14,486 --> 00:28:16,405
It's a wish. Any wish.

377
00:28:16,613 --> 00:28:19,741
As long as it doesn't violate
the laws of nature.

378
00:28:20,534 --> 00:28:23,287
We'll help you.
We'll help you.

379
00:28:23,495 --> 00:28:25,539
-Yes. Yes.
-Yes. Yes.

380
00:28:26,874 --> 00:28:28,959
Just to let you know...

381
00:28:29,168 --> 00:28:31,545
...this is a humongous sacrifice for us.
-Yeah.

382
00:28:31,753 --> 00:28:33,213
Giving up Raymond?

383
00:28:33,422 --> 00:28:35,048
So you know him pretty well?

384
00:28:35,257 --> 00:28:37,801
Oh, yeah. We're experts on Raymond.

385
00:28:37,968 --> 00:28:41,388
-Yeah, we know him really well.
-We're like Rayologists.

386
00:28:41,597 --> 00:28:44,308
Good. But he has to say he loves me.

387
00:28:44,516 --> 00:28:46,310
Because I need proof for my dad.

388
00:28:46,518 --> 00:28:48,729
Otherwise you don't get your wish.
Deal?

389
00:28:50,355 --> 00:28:51,940
Deal.

390
00:28:52,816 --> 00:28:54,443
Deal.

391
00:28:55,194 --> 00:28:57,321
My name's Aquamarine.

392
00:28:57,529 --> 00:29:01,116
Now, let's go find Raymond.

393
00:29:06,038 --> 00:29:09,791
-You need shoes.
-Yeah, and undies.

394
00:29:37,069 --> 00:29:41,281
Just stick with the pros.
Boys are what we live for.

395
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:43,659
Creepy, right?
My mom collects this stuff.

396
00:29:43,867 --> 00:29:45,244
What does your mom do?

397
00:29:45,452 --> 00:29:47,746
Besides ruin my life?
She's a marine biologist.

398
00:29:47,955 --> 00:29:50,332
-Yeah, she's all scientific.
-More like horrific.

399
00:29:50,874 --> 00:29:53,043
She's dragged me
over the country for her job.

400
00:29:53,252 --> 00:29:55,087
She's been working
to clean up the bay.

401
00:29:55,254 --> 00:29:56,755
Well, tell her thanks for me...

402
00:29:56,964 --> 00:29:59,800
...because it tastes 10 times
better than it did years ago.

403
00:30:00,092 --> 00:30:01,593
Really?

404
00:30:03,428 --> 00:30:04,888
Okay, first things first.

405
00:30:05,639 --> 00:30:07,933
Aqua, what are you doing?

406
00:30:08,141 --> 00:30:09,768
He doesn't like this harsh light.

407
00:30:14,231 --> 00:30:17,693
Moby. He came out of hiding.

408
00:30:18,277 --> 00:30:20,320
Can you make boobs
come out of hiding?

409
00:30:23,615 --> 00:30:25,659
We begin where a girl starts a first crush.

410
00:30:26,493 --> 00:30:27,911
We call him.

411
00:30:28,579 --> 00:30:29,913
Call him? What?

412
00:30:30,122 --> 00:30:32,457
No, I can't.
What am I supposed to say to him?

413
00:30:32,666 --> 00:30:35,919
Nothing. We just call and hang up.
We do it all the time.

414
00:30:36,545 --> 00:30:39,423
-Why?
-I don't know. It's just what you do.

415
00:30:40,174 --> 00:30:41,884
Okay.

416
00:30:44,261 --> 00:30:45,721
Wait a minute.

417
00:30:47,681 --> 00:30:49,433
It's ringing.

418
00:30:50,642 --> 00:30:52,102
<i>Hello?</i>

419
00:30:58,483 --> 00:31:00,569
That was fantastic.
Let's do it again.

420
00:31:04,114 --> 00:31:06,492
Okay.
The next step here is the ride-by.

421
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:10,579
-Very important in any crush.
-Now remember, you have to act casual.

422
00:31:10,746 --> 00:31:13,707
Yes, like you didn't even remember
this was his street.

423
00:31:20,088 --> 00:31:22,341
That's it. That's Raymond's house.

424
00:31:28,722 --> 00:31:30,933
Oh, that hurts.
But this will be worth it.

425
00:31:33,685 --> 00:31:35,729
There he is.

426
00:31:38,232 --> 00:31:40,025
What the...?

427
00:31:54,623 --> 00:31:56,667
Aqua, no, that's the brake.

428
00:32:15,435 --> 00:32:18,689
-Aqua, are you okay?
-I saw him. Did you see him?

429
00:32:18,897 --> 00:32:21,483
-He waved at me.
-Hey, hey, hey, are you okay?

430
00:32:21,692 --> 00:32:24,903
-Hi, Raymond.
-Oh, my God.

431
00:32:26,029 --> 00:32:28,490
We didn't even remember
this was your street.

432
00:32:31,577 --> 00:32:33,829
All right,
let's see what you've got here.

433
00:32:35,622 --> 00:32:36,957
Nothing too serious.

434
00:32:37,875 --> 00:32:40,127
-We'll run it under some cold water...
-No. No.

435
00:32:40,294 --> 00:32:42,671
Oh, hey, hey, hey.
I wouldn't hurt you.

436
00:32:44,089 --> 00:32:46,717
All right, let me at least
put a Band-Aid on it.

437
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:49,678
Lifeguard's always prepared, right?

438
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,599
Here we go.

439
00:32:54,099 --> 00:32:56,643
This won't hurt a bit.

440
00:32:58,228 --> 00:33:00,522
There you go. Voila!

441
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:03,317
Thank you.

442
00:33:05,068 --> 00:33:07,029
It's beautiful.

443
00:33:10,699 --> 00:33:13,494
So, what was your name?

444
00:33:14,369 --> 00:33:15,704
Aquamarine.

445
00:33:15,871 --> 00:33:18,499
Cool name. Will I see you
at the Street Fair today?

446
00:33:20,334 --> 00:33:23,629
-I love this song.
-Oh, no.

447
00:33:24,338 --> 00:33:26,882
-Who ordered broom service?
-Hi, Raymond.

448
00:33:29,009 --> 00:33:31,261
I'm here for my driving lesson.

449
00:33:33,055 --> 00:33:34,765
Let's get you up.

450
00:33:35,432 --> 00:33:37,142
You going to be all right?

451
00:33:37,351 --> 00:33:41,396
Okay, cool. Hang on one sec.
I got to grab my keys.

452
00:33:42,439 --> 00:33:45,108
So, I'll see you later?

453
00:33:46,151 --> 00:33:48,570
Rock. Check it. Watch out.

454
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:51,782
-Who is she?
-Cecilia.

455
00:33:51,949 --> 00:33:54,076
Thinks she's the shiz,
because her dad does weather.

456
00:33:54,243 --> 00:33:58,080
-Her dad can make weather?
-No. He just reports it.

457
00:33:58,288 --> 00:33:59,665
Shut up. I know how to drive.

458
00:34:01,124 --> 00:34:04,962
-And she's a princess?
-No, no, no, just a royal bitch.

459
00:34:05,128 --> 00:34:06,880
Then why are you so intimidated?

460
00:34:07,548 --> 00:34:09,174
Got it. Sorry.

461
00:34:15,472 --> 00:34:18,475
Hey, guys, does she have something
against girls' clothes?

462
00:34:23,188 --> 00:34:24,857
Nice hair.

463
00:34:25,148 --> 00:34:27,025
-Who are you?
-Aquamarine.

464
00:34:27,234 --> 00:34:30,487
-She's my cousin.
-Well, that's kind of pretty.

465
00:34:30,696 --> 00:34:32,739
For a crayon.

466
00:34:33,198 --> 00:34:36,535
I was named Aquamarine
after a rare and precious gemstone.

467
00:34:36,743 --> 00:34:42,124
Whereas Cecilia translated means
dim-sighted.

468
00:34:42,374 --> 00:34:45,085
But your parents know you
better than I do.

469
00:34:45,711 --> 00:34:47,171
What did you just say to me?

470
00:34:48,005 --> 00:34:50,966
Yep, definitely dim-sighted.

471
00:35:01,518 --> 00:35:03,854
There's something very fishy
about that girl.

472
00:35:04,062 --> 00:35:05,856
Cecilia Banks blew a gasket.

473
00:35:06,356 --> 00:35:09,985
Who cares about her.
What about Ray? I mean...

474
00:35:10,986 --> 00:35:12,946
...what happened to me back there?

475
00:35:13,155 --> 00:35:16,867
-I was such a clam. I couldn't think.
-Don't worry.

476
00:35:17,075 --> 00:35:20,037
Everything we've learned about boys
has come from the pages...

477
00:35:20,329 --> 00:35:23,040
...of these magazines. Come on.

478
00:35:23,373 --> 00:35:28,504
I can't stop thinking about him.
I feel so weird and tingly.

479
00:35:30,672 --> 00:35:32,591
-What?
-Look at my finger scales.

480
00:35:33,258 --> 00:35:34,551
Oh, wow.

481
00:35:34,843 --> 00:35:38,222
They've never been this color before.
They change color with my mood.

482
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:41,141
-Whoa, weird.
-But I don't know what mood this is.

483
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:44,228
-Love.
-Love.

484
00:35:44,561 --> 00:35:48,315
Okay. Start reading. We have a lot
to cover before we go to the Street Fair.

485
00:36:01,703 --> 00:36:03,580
Oh, I don't like this.

486
00:36:08,418 --> 00:36:09,753
Come on.

487
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:12,256
-I need some salt.
-More like this.

488
00:36:14,758 --> 00:36:16,718
Number 28.
Come on.

489
00:36:17,803 --> 00:36:20,389
Come on, focus. Focus.

490
00:36:31,733 --> 00:36:34,361
How do you
remember all this?

491
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:37,906
-You have to be flirty but demure.
-Yeah.

492
00:36:38,115 --> 00:36:41,326
Devoted, but not desperate.
Available but elusive.

493
00:36:41,785 --> 00:36:44,621
And if he calls Wednesday
for Saturday, you have to be busy.

494
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:46,707
Even though you're free.

495
00:36:46,915 --> 00:36:48,625
It's so annoying.

496
00:36:49,626 --> 00:36:51,837
Yet strangely addictive.

497
00:36:52,045 --> 00:36:55,132
-No. No.
-I think she's on a boy-data overload.

498
00:36:55,507 --> 00:36:56,842
Let's take her out.

499
00:36:57,676 --> 00:36:59,511
Roll up. Roll up.

500
00:37:02,931 --> 00:37:04,725
-Ain't got a chance.
-It's right here.

501
00:37:04,933 --> 00:37:06,727
There he is.

502
00:37:07,019 --> 00:37:08,854
-Ray. Ray, hi.
-Calm down.

503
00:37:09,062 --> 00:37:12,649
Haven't you learned anything?
Let him see you first.

504
00:37:12,858 --> 00:37:15,569
-Sorry. I just got so excited, I forgot.
-It's okay.

505
00:37:15,777 --> 00:37:20,782
Hey, how about if we do what...?
What "Liz D. from Skokie" suggests?

506
00:37:20,991 --> 00:37:25,829
"The laugh and pass. "
Casually walk past him laughing.

507
00:37:26,038 --> 00:37:27,664
Good idea.

508
00:37:30,209 --> 00:37:32,336
You're so funny.

509
00:37:36,465 --> 00:37:38,258
Okay, look at him.

510
00:37:40,427 --> 00:37:42,054
Look away.

511
00:37:42,638 --> 00:37:45,390
Look at him, play with your hair.
Just kind of twirl it.

512
00:37:45,557 --> 00:37:47,434
Yeah, I saw that.

513
00:37:47,643 --> 00:37:50,854
-Arch your back. Arch your back.
-Pucker your lips, flip your hair.

514
00:37:51,063 --> 00:37:53,398
-Flip it. Yeah, flip it.
-Put your back out.

515
00:37:53,607 --> 00:37:56,318
Don't look at him.
No, no. He's looking at you.

516
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:59,321
-Okay. "Fluff and Retreat. "
-What?

517
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:01,323
Come on, you can do it.
Come on, Ray.

518
00:38:01,532 --> 00:38:03,700
Fluff his ego, and retreat. Go.

519
00:38:04,993 --> 00:38:06,954
Yeah!

520
00:38:07,788 --> 00:38:09,581
Wow, Raymond, you're good.

521
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:12,501
-Bye.
-Wha...? Wha...?

522
00:38:12,709 --> 00:38:15,128
-You didn't fluff enough.
-Here you go, man.

523
00:38:16,088 --> 00:38:18,090
-Hey, where are you going?
-Guess she did.

524
00:38:18,298 --> 00:38:20,050
-Come on.
-Guys, I'll catch up.

525
00:38:20,259 --> 00:38:22,427
-I'll hang out with Aqua.
-He gave a nickname.

526
00:38:22,845 --> 00:38:25,055
-Hey.
-Hi.

527
00:38:27,307 --> 00:38:29,893
Are you having a good time?

528
00:38:31,228 --> 00:38:33,689
Yes, following you around is fun.

529
00:38:34,398 --> 00:38:35,983
Okay.

530
00:38:39,903 --> 00:38:44,158
-This guy's for you.
-Thanks.

531
00:38:44,366 --> 00:38:46,910
-Cotton candy. Get your cotton candy.
-You're welcome.

532
00:38:47,828 --> 00:38:51,915
<i>Hurry, hurry. On the fairground
foreground you and the family...</i>

533
00:38:52,166 --> 00:38:54,293
<i>...and the weird Tattoo Lady.
-You want one?</i>

534
00:38:54,501 --> 00:38:56,503
Yeah.

535
00:38:58,714 --> 00:39:00,716
Just one, please. Thanks.

536
00:39:11,518 --> 00:39:14,062
I just love eating cotton candy.
I mean...

537
00:39:14,271 --> 00:39:16,481
...I love eating it. Right, Hail?

538
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:18,859
It's great.
It is so much fun to eat it.

539
00:39:27,659 --> 00:39:29,786
It just vanished.

540
00:39:37,711 --> 00:39:39,588
Shake...

541
00:39:41,298 --> 00:39:43,217
...stretch...

542
00:39:46,845 --> 00:39:49,598
...flex.
He likes her!

543
00:39:51,934 --> 00:39:54,853
-Roll up, roll up.
-Hey, what are those, water bikes?

544
00:39:56,396 --> 00:39:58,690
What? You've never been
on a paddleboat before?

545
00:39:58,899 --> 00:40:00,526
-Oh, he's so cute.
-Come on...

546
00:40:00,734 --> 00:40:03,153
...I'll give you your first ride.
-Sure.

547
00:40:03,362 --> 00:40:07,241
-Do you think she'll be okay out there?
-She's with Ray, isn't she?

548
00:40:07,449 --> 00:40:10,369
-Popcorn. Get your popcorn.
-I guess. Come on.

549
00:40:18,502 --> 00:40:21,755
So, how long are you in town?

550
00:40:21,964 --> 00:40:25,175
Two more days.
Then my dad's making me come home.

551
00:40:25,384 --> 00:40:28,971
If he doesn't get his way,
it's always a huge disaster.

552
00:40:29,179 --> 00:40:30,597
Pretty controlling, huh?

553
00:40:31,473 --> 00:40:34,226
-You have no idea.
-Yeah, I do.

554
00:40:34,434 --> 00:40:37,729
My dad, he's all dead set
on me starting college next week...

555
00:40:37,938 --> 00:40:41,066
...but, I don't know, I wanna
take a year off and travel.

556
00:40:41,275 --> 00:40:44,945
I've never been out of Florida, so
we've been arguing about it all summer.

557
00:40:45,445 --> 00:40:49,283
And, he'll probably win the argument.
He always does.

558
00:40:49,491 --> 00:40:52,327
They just don't get it.
Sometimes, you have to leave home...

559
00:40:52,536 --> 00:40:55,080
...to figure out what you want.
-Exactly.

560
00:40:58,208 --> 00:41:02,004
You know, you're not like
most girls around here.

561
00:41:05,382 --> 00:41:07,009
They're so cute together.

562
00:41:07,217 --> 00:41:09,678
Claire, how romantic is that?

563
00:41:10,512 --> 00:41:12,222
This is nice.

564
00:41:14,057 --> 00:41:16,268
-The sun is setting.
-Yeah, I know.

565
00:41:16,476 --> 00:41:18,854
-We timed it well, didn't we?
-I have to get back.

566
00:41:19,021 --> 00:41:20,898
What? Okay.

567
00:41:24,234 --> 00:41:25,986
-All right. Okay. All right.
-Oh, no.

568
00:41:26,153 --> 00:41:28,864
We're going the wrong way.
We're heading back out to sea.

569
00:41:29,031 --> 00:41:31,992
Here we go, we're turning around.
Everything's okay.

570
00:41:32,201 --> 00:41:33,911
-Hailey.
-Claire.

571
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:35,496
-Sunset.
-Oh, no.

572
00:41:35,704 --> 00:41:37,748
-She's gonna pop a tail.
-Hailey. Claire.

573
00:41:37,956 --> 00:41:40,417
Just add moonlight or water.

574
00:41:40,626 --> 00:41:43,045
-I have to get back.
-Hey. Hey.

575
00:41:43,253 --> 00:41:46,215
Here, let's talk about something
to distract you, okay?

576
00:41:46,423 --> 00:41:49,510
Like, what are you doing
tomorrow night?

577
00:41:49,718 --> 00:41:52,721
-Probably heard about the Last Splash?
-We're coming Aqua.

578
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:56,642
-It's a party. You're really in a hurry.
-Come on. Hurry up. Pedal.

579
00:41:56,850 --> 00:41:59,561
It's not your fault.
I have to be somewhere.

580
00:42:01,813 --> 00:42:04,191
You gotta help our friend.
She's sick. She's got...

581
00:42:04,358 --> 00:42:05,692
-Hydrophobia.
-Hypertension.

582
00:42:05,859 --> 00:42:07,194
Yeah.

583
00:42:07,903 --> 00:42:10,030
-Yeah.
-Come on. Hurry, please.

584
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:11,657
This is serious.

585
00:42:11,865 --> 00:42:13,408
Go faster.

586
00:42:13,617 --> 00:42:15,118
-Hey.
-Oh, no.

587
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:18,121
-Okay.
-You're almost there.

588
00:42:18,288 --> 00:42:21,208
-Come on. You're almost there.
-Excuse me. Sorry. Pardon me.

589
00:42:21,375 --> 00:42:22,793
-Careful.
-Hey.

590
00:42:23,001 --> 00:42:24,878
Let's go. Keep going.
Don't stop.

591
00:42:25,087 --> 00:42:26,547
Bikes are around the corner.

592
00:42:26,755 --> 00:42:29,049
-Run.
-Sorry.

593
00:42:29,675 --> 00:42:31,009
-Go.
-I had so much fun.

594
00:42:31,176 --> 00:42:33,804
Go. Aqua, go, go.
We gotta get you back.

595
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,561
I'll be right back.

596
00:42:41,645 --> 00:42:42,980
Hey, Ray.

597
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:46,817
That was too close.
I need some water to spend the night in.

598
00:42:47,025 --> 00:42:48,402
-The ocean?
-No ocean.

599
00:42:48,569 --> 00:42:51,822
My father would just manipulate
the currents and pull me back home.

600
00:42:51,989 --> 00:42:53,574
I know a place.

601
00:42:57,202 --> 00:42:59,621
Holy mackerel.

602
00:42:59,913 --> 00:43:01,832
Hey, come on.

603
00:43:07,546 --> 00:43:09,715
Come on let's go.
Claire, you doing this?

604
00:43:10,507 --> 00:43:13,343
-Aren't you coming?
-I don't do water...

605
00:43:13,552 --> 00:43:15,179
...on the ground or in the air.

606
00:43:15,929 --> 00:43:19,391
Raymond was about to kiss you
with his actual lips.

607
00:43:20,475 --> 00:43:22,686
-Stupid sun.
-Did Ray say anything?

608
00:43:23,061 --> 00:43:25,814
-He asked if I heard of Last Splash.
-What?

609
00:43:26,023 --> 00:43:28,025
-Really?
-Exactly what did he say?

610
00:43:30,736 --> 00:43:32,446
-I can't remember.
-So was it:

611
00:43:32,613 --> 00:43:35,032
"Are you going?"
or "Will you go with me?"

612
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:36,950
-Is there a difference?
-Huge.

613
00:43:37,159 --> 00:43:39,036
-Major.
-Okay. Well...

614
00:43:39,244 --> 00:43:42,581
...it started with,
"What are you doing tomorrow night?"

615
00:43:42,789 --> 00:43:44,124
My God, that's all you need.

616
00:43:44,291 --> 00:43:45,626
He was gonna ask for a date.

617
00:43:45,834 --> 00:43:47,503
-He was?
-Absolutely.

618
00:43:47,711 --> 00:43:51,465
-Yes.
-Be careful, guys.

619
00:43:57,596 --> 00:44:00,432
-Thanks.
-Sure.

620
00:44:06,396 --> 00:44:09,608
-Why won't Claire come with us?
-She's not good around water.

621
00:44:09,817 --> 00:44:11,485
It's kind of a long story.

622
00:44:17,991 --> 00:44:20,869
I wish I could hide out here with you.

623
00:44:32,256 --> 00:44:35,759
-Is this gonna be okay?
-Yeah.

624
00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:04,746
I almost forgot.

625
00:45:05,247 --> 00:45:06,915
Me too.

626
00:45:07,541 --> 00:45:10,460
-This is nice.
-Good.

627
00:45:10,711 --> 00:45:12,921
Are you gonna be okay in here?

628
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:15,299
You gonna be okay out there?

629
00:45:19,678 --> 00:45:21,096
I'll see you tomorrow...

630
00:45:21,346 --> 00:45:24,183
...fish-butt.
-I heard that.

631
00:45:26,101 --> 00:45:28,312
I never realized
how big this room was.

632
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:31,440
Without all my stuff in it.
I want this wish so bad, Claire.

633
00:45:36,278 --> 00:45:37,571
Claire?

634
00:45:39,323 --> 00:45:43,577
Do you think he'll fall in actual love
with her in two days?

635
00:45:43,785 --> 00:45:47,498
He has to. It's our last hope.

636
00:45:52,794 --> 00:45:54,505
-Hailey.
-What?

637
00:45:54,713 --> 00:45:58,217
We completely forgot something.
What's she gonna wear to Last Splash?

638
00:45:58,425 --> 00:46:01,678
I mean, she can't keep wearing
your t-shirts. No offense.

639
00:46:01,887 --> 00:46:05,766
Okay, think. We'll take the first bus into
Tampa tomorrow and we'll go shopping.

640
00:46:05,974 --> 00:46:08,393
-Wha...? No. We can't.
-We have to.

641
00:46:08,727 --> 00:46:12,731
Besides, I have $400 saved up
from working at the aquarium.

642
00:46:12,981 --> 00:46:16,527
-Do you know what trouble we'll be in?
-Come on, Clairedy Cat.

643
00:46:19,822 --> 00:46:23,867
-Sorry about that.
-I don't know, Hailey.

644
00:46:29,456 --> 00:46:30,958
Smile.

645
00:46:38,590 --> 00:46:40,884
Hello.

646
00:46:43,095 --> 00:46:46,390
What? Why go through life unnoticed?

647
00:46:56,859 --> 00:46:59,403
-This store is hideous.
-This store is for old people.

648
00:47:00,529 --> 00:47:03,157
-Yeah.
-No. No.

649
00:47:03,532 --> 00:47:05,951
-This store is kind of lame.
-It's all used stuff.

650
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:09,705
Come on you guys. It's so different
from anything else we saw at the mall.

651
00:47:09,872 --> 00:47:11,623
Come on.
Just give it a chance.

652
00:47:20,799 --> 00:47:22,467
Hey, you guys.

653
00:47:25,971 --> 00:47:28,307
-It's old-fashioned, but it works.
-I don't know.

654
00:47:28,515 --> 00:47:30,934
I love vintage.

655
00:47:32,019 --> 00:47:34,188
Look at these sleeves.

656
00:47:43,572 --> 00:47:45,199
Sorry.

657
00:48:13,101 --> 00:48:17,189
Okay, we've got three hours
till Last Splash, so quick review?

658
00:48:17,397 --> 00:48:18,732
-Dresses?
-Check.

659
00:48:18,899 --> 00:48:20,943
-Blue highlights?
-Big check.

660
00:48:21,151 --> 00:48:23,821
-Are we missing anything?
-Wait.

661
00:48:24,029 --> 00:48:25,489
I don't have earrings.

662
00:48:25,697 --> 00:48:29,701
-How could I not have earrings?
-I have earrings. Don't worry.

663
00:48:33,497 --> 00:48:37,167
Pretty, and pointy?

664
00:48:38,043 --> 00:48:40,337
What am I supposed to do with this?

665
00:48:40,546 --> 00:48:43,090
Like, stick it through my skin?

666
00:48:43,298 --> 00:48:47,094
-That's what you do.
-You're so primitive.

667
00:48:47,302 --> 00:48:49,346
-I wear stick-ons.
-You mean clip-ons?

668
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,056
No.

669
00:48:52,808 --> 00:48:55,519
You'll love these.
They're my favorite aquatic accessory.

670
00:48:55,853 --> 00:48:57,521
You see that buoy out there?

671
00:48:57,729 --> 00:49:01,108
I need you to swim out there
and find me a couple of starfish about...

672
00:49:02,818 --> 00:49:04,570
...this big?
-Live starfish.

673
00:49:04,778 --> 00:49:06,780
That's what you wear for earrings?

674
00:49:06,989 --> 00:49:08,323
They compliment me.

675
00:49:08,532 --> 00:49:11,410
Aqua, I've got earrings
that'll complement you just fine.

676
00:49:11,618 --> 00:49:14,496
No, I mean, they literally
give me compliments.

677
00:49:14,705 --> 00:49:16,123
In my ear.
They talk to me.

678
00:49:16,331 --> 00:49:19,251
Starfish are notorious suck-ups.

679
00:49:19,459 --> 00:49:21,420
They love to give compliments.

680
00:49:21,628 --> 00:49:24,256
But it's nice
when you need a little boost.

681
00:49:24,464 --> 00:49:26,425
Okay, you guys. Let's go.

682
00:49:26,633 --> 00:49:30,053
Hailey, I can't. You've got to do this.

683
00:49:30,262 --> 00:49:32,681
Do you see how far that buoy is?
No.

684
00:49:32,890 --> 00:49:35,434
Don't worry about it.
I'll get you a ride.

685
00:49:51,783 --> 00:49:54,369
No way.

686
00:49:56,413 --> 00:49:59,166
-Oh, hi.
-Oh, my goodness.

687
00:49:59,374 --> 00:50:01,502
Hi, guys.

688
00:50:02,419 --> 00:50:05,547
Watch the legs, guys.

689
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:07,674
-Claire, look at that.
-Hi.

690
00:50:07,966 --> 00:50:11,720
Oh, my goodness.
Claire, you have to do this with me.

691
00:50:16,016 --> 00:50:17,643
You go.

692
00:50:17,851 --> 00:50:19,436
Have fun.

693
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:22,022
Okay. All right.

694
00:50:27,653 --> 00:50:29,488
Are you sure?

695
00:50:29,738 --> 00:50:31,240
Yeah.

696
00:50:47,756 --> 00:50:50,050
Claire, look at me.

697
00:50:51,677 --> 00:50:54,096
Way to go, Hails.

698
00:51:03,188 --> 00:51:05,816
-Hailey.
-Hi, guys!

699
00:51:10,821 --> 00:51:14,366
Don't you just love love?

700
00:51:16,118 --> 00:51:17,536
What?

701
00:51:18,078 --> 00:51:19,705
It's just...

702
00:51:20,164 --> 00:51:21,874
...you're so sure of yourself.

703
00:51:22,332 --> 00:51:24,334
Well, I've only seen love
up close once...

704
00:51:24,501 --> 00:51:27,629
...but, if you'd seen it the way I did,
you'd feel the same way.

705
00:51:27,838 --> 00:51:29,464
Why?

706
00:51:29,798 --> 00:51:32,342
-What was it like?
-It was years ago.

707
00:51:32,551 --> 00:51:35,137
Not too far from here, actually.

708
00:51:35,470 --> 00:51:39,683
We were migrating through the bay just
like we always do this time of year...

709
00:51:40,684 --> 00:51:43,979
...and I saw this couple out sailing
on their little blue boat.

710
00:51:44,813 --> 00:51:47,232
And the way
they looked at each other...

711
00:51:47,816 --> 00:51:51,820
...it was a look I'd never seen
anywhere else in the seven seas.

712
00:51:52,488 --> 00:51:55,824
I've wanted someone
to look at me that way ever since.

713
00:51:56,408 --> 00:52:00,245
I looked for them every year,
but I never saw them again.

714
00:52:00,579 --> 00:52:05,751
-Was there a name on the boat?
-I don't remember, Claire.

715
00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:08,045
<i>Oh, the Claire d'Lune.</i>

716
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:13,091
Those were my parents.

717
00:52:17,846 --> 00:52:20,224
Claire, they really loved each other.

718
00:52:23,143 --> 00:52:26,104
I don't think they would have
wanted you to be afraid of life.

719
00:52:27,231 --> 00:52:30,192
I think they would have wanted you
to be friends with it.

720
00:52:32,569 --> 00:52:35,405
-Yeah.
-Hey, I found some.

721
00:52:35,614 --> 00:52:38,992
-A matching set.
-Hailey.

722
00:52:46,792 --> 00:52:49,044
It was the most incredible thing ever.

723
00:52:49,253 --> 00:52:51,046
Something I wish I had
done with you.

724
00:52:51,213 --> 00:52:52,756
-Aqua. Aqua.
-There you go.

725
00:52:52,965 --> 00:52:55,300
-Oh, Aqua.
-And one for you.

726
00:52:55,509 --> 00:52:56,844
Thank you.

727
00:52:57,010 --> 00:53:01,640
-Aquamarine is so lovely.
-Oh, stop.

728
00:53:01,849 --> 00:53:03,767
She makes us so lovely...

729
00:53:03,976 --> 00:53:08,105
...just being near such loveliness.

730
00:53:08,313 --> 00:53:10,107
And she's smart.

731
00:53:10,274 --> 00:53:14,319
-Smart, yes, like tuna.
-Like tuna.

732
00:53:14,528 --> 00:53:17,739
We love being near Aqua.

733
00:53:17,948 --> 00:53:19,992
Aqua-Aqua.

734
00:53:21,368 --> 00:53:24,913
-Look who it is.
-Wow. The blue hair is spreading.

735
00:53:25,247 --> 00:53:27,541
You guys look like
the Grandma Brigade.

736
00:53:28,375 --> 00:53:31,253
What's next, dentures or Depends?

737
00:53:31,461 --> 00:53:34,548
What's next is I'm going with Raymond
to the Last Splash.

738
00:53:35,174 --> 00:53:36,508
I've got some advice.

739
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:39,678
You need to separate fantasy
from reality.

740
00:53:39,887 --> 00:53:42,222
Ray's going to the Last Splash
with Cecilia.

741
00:53:42,431 --> 00:53:45,058
-She asked him at the Street Fair.
-What?

742
00:53:46,268 --> 00:53:49,855
Love to stay and chat, but
we're late for Cecilia's pre-party.

743
00:53:50,063 --> 00:53:52,900
I've got some advice for you too.

744
00:54:01,867 --> 00:54:03,327
Put on a dry shirt.

745
00:54:04,995 --> 00:54:07,623
-That was totally amazing.
-That was great.

746
00:54:09,666 --> 00:54:11,210
It's Ray.

747
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:16,089
I can't believe I was so stupid.
Why would he choose her over me?

748
00:54:16,423 --> 00:54:19,551
You're supposed to know him.
He obviously doesn't like me at all.

749
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:23,347
-That's not possible.
-I never should've trusted you.

750
00:54:23,555 --> 00:54:27,100
-He's into you. This doesn't make sense.
-Bull shark.

751
00:54:27,309 --> 00:54:30,521
-Forget it. I'm going home.
-Aqua, no.

752
00:54:30,729 --> 00:54:32,523
-Wait.
-Claire.

753
00:54:32,731 --> 00:54:36,860
This is totally, completely,
eternally over.

754
00:54:37,277 --> 00:54:38,987
I'm moving.

755
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:41,615
I'm going to be the new girl again.

756
00:54:45,452 --> 00:54:47,371
You know what. No.

757
00:54:47,871 --> 00:54:49,248
No, we're gonna split up.

758
00:54:49,456 --> 00:54:51,583
You're gonna go stop Aqua, and...

759
00:54:51,792 --> 00:54:53,752
...and I'm gonna go find Raymond.
Okay?

760
00:54:53,961 --> 00:54:56,255
Meet me back at the club
as soon as possible.

761
00:54:56,463 --> 00:54:58,674
Hurry. Go.

762
00:55:19,027 --> 00:55:21,238
Aqua, don't do it.

763
00:55:23,198 --> 00:55:24,783
Don't do it.

764
00:55:26,326 --> 00:55:29,538
-Aqua, you can't do this.
-Why not?

765
00:55:29,746 --> 00:55:33,458
I'm never going to see him again.
You know what? He doesn't care.

766
00:55:34,042 --> 00:55:36,420
I'm just gonna go home.
This was all for nothing.

767
00:55:36,587 --> 00:55:38,505
It was not for nothing.
It was for love.

768
00:55:38,714 --> 00:55:40,465
You know what I think of love?

769
00:55:40,674 --> 00:55:42,092
Love stinks.

770
00:55:42,301 --> 00:55:44,178
No wonder we don't have it
back home.

771
00:55:45,804 --> 00:55:48,765
-Please don't give up yet.
-Why? Because of your wish?

772
00:55:50,184 --> 00:55:52,352
Let me tell you something.

773
00:55:53,187 --> 00:55:55,481
My dad said he loved me.

774
00:55:55,689 --> 00:55:58,108
He said he loved my mother
and then he left us.

775
00:55:58,317 --> 00:56:00,694
He left us for some other woman...

776
00:56:01,487 --> 00:56:04,740
...but I guess that's the way it is,
and love doesn't always work.

777
00:56:06,074 --> 00:56:08,452
I don't understand.

778
00:56:09,411 --> 00:56:10,746
That's life.

779
00:56:10,954 --> 00:56:13,957
That's how it is here.
But, when you find love...

780
00:56:14,166 --> 00:56:17,336
...I guess it's really beautiful.
That's what I've read.

781
00:56:17,544 --> 00:56:19,922
And I don't know as much
about it as I say I do...

782
00:56:20,130 --> 00:56:22,966
...but I know that there's a reason
why everybody wants it.

783
00:56:23,133 --> 00:56:24,468
And what's that?

784
00:56:28,055 --> 00:56:30,224
It's the closest thing
we have to magic.

785
00:56:33,727 --> 00:56:35,771
Don't give up yet.

786
00:56:40,317 --> 00:56:43,904
Oh, my God,
what's happening to me?

787
00:56:45,155 --> 00:56:46,698
I'm leaking.

788
00:56:48,033 --> 00:56:51,078
-Aqua, you're crying.
-I'm leaking salt water.

789
00:56:51,286 --> 00:56:52,788
I'm falling apart.

790
00:56:53,205 --> 00:56:56,458
No, they're tears. Your body
makes them when you cry.

791
00:56:56,750 --> 00:56:59,878
I guess you wouldn't have them,
living underwater.

792
00:57:00,838 --> 00:57:03,340
This is crazy.
Next you're going to tell me...

793
00:57:03,549 --> 00:57:05,968
...water shoots out of your nose
when you're happy.

794
00:57:07,928 --> 00:57:09,888
Only occasionally.

795
00:57:16,687 --> 00:57:18,021
Nice bike.

796
00:57:21,358 --> 00:57:24,236
Time for a swim.

797
00:57:28,157 --> 00:57:29,867
Excuse me.

798
00:57:38,709 --> 00:57:42,337
-How could you do this to Aqua?
-Do what?

799
00:57:42,546 --> 00:57:46,091
Take Cecilia to the Last Splash
after you already asked Aquamarine?

800
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:50,554
Yeah, well, that was before
I found out that she has a boyfriend.

801
00:57:50,929 --> 00:57:52,431
-A boyfriend?
-Yeah.

802
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:56,393
The one she practically jumped
overboard for to watch the sunset.

803
00:57:56,602 --> 00:57:59,480
Aqua doesn't have a boyfriend.
Who told you that?

804
00:58:02,191 --> 00:58:06,153
Vince. Vince.
The little girl wants to go in.

805
00:58:06,653 --> 00:58:09,114
-I want to go in where?
-Into the pool.

806
00:58:09,323 --> 00:58:11,408
No, put me down.

807
00:58:11,617 --> 00:58:13,827
-Vince, don't, man. Don't. Stop.
-Put me down.

808
00:58:14,036 --> 00:58:15,662
-Put me down!
-Man, put her down.

809
00:58:15,871 --> 00:58:18,040
Okay, okay.

810
00:58:18,832 --> 00:58:21,084
Jeez, relax. What's the big drama?

811
00:58:22,544 --> 00:58:23,879
Whatever.

812
00:58:32,304 --> 00:58:34,681
God, take a joke.

813
00:58:35,974 --> 00:58:39,061
Take a joke? What's the matter
with you? She's scared.

814
00:58:39,645 --> 00:58:41,647
She was trying to get attention.
Hello.

815
00:58:41,855 --> 00:58:43,899
No, that's your job,
isn't it, Cecilia?

816
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:49,112
Raymond, I was kidding.

817
00:58:49,446 --> 00:58:51,198
Joke. Hello.

818
00:58:54,326 --> 00:58:56,119
Claire. Claire, hold on.

819
00:58:58,247 --> 00:58:59,957
You okay?

820
00:59:00,624 --> 00:59:04,294
Look, you know where I can find Aqua?
I really need to talk to her.

821
00:59:06,588 --> 00:59:10,217
Yeah? Is that a nod?
I know I see a nod.

822
00:59:11,510 --> 00:59:14,346
<i>This next one's
for the brokenhearted out there.</i>

823
00:59:25,274 --> 00:59:26,775
Who needs Raymond?

824
00:59:26,984 --> 00:59:30,070
I found two new men to love
and their names are Ben and Jerry.

825
00:59:40,747 --> 00:59:45,127
Raymond. Who needs Raymond?
I need some salt.

826
00:59:45,711 --> 00:59:47,921
I don't know what Cecilia
was talking about.

827
00:59:50,632 --> 00:59:53,886
I think they're in here.
In my room.

828
00:59:57,139 --> 00:59:58,974
Oh, gosh.

829
00:59:59,183 --> 01:00:02,478
-Hey.
-Sorry. I'm sorry.

830
01:00:02,686 --> 01:00:04,438
How's it going?

831
01:00:05,314 --> 01:00:07,524
Bad. No, good. Fine.

832
01:00:07,733 --> 01:00:10,235
Just wait on the balcony,
and we'll be out in a sec.

833
01:00:13,113 --> 01:00:14,531
<i>What are you doing?</i>

834
01:00:18,827 --> 01:00:20,621
What was he doing here?

835
01:00:20,829 --> 01:00:22,664
Cecilia told him Aqua had a boyfriend.

836
01:00:24,208 --> 01:00:26,210
That... That barnacle.

837
01:00:26,418 --> 01:00:28,045
But Raymond wants to talk to you.

838
01:00:28,378 --> 01:00:32,341
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
-Yes. Yes. Yes.

839
01:00:48,315 --> 01:00:50,317
-You know what?
-Then the fish attacked me.

840
01:00:50,526 --> 01:00:51,860
-It attacked you?
-Yeah.

841
01:00:52,069 --> 01:00:53,987
-Kind of like a penguin.
-Later, guys.

842
01:00:54,196 --> 01:00:56,573
-Oh, hey.
-Thanks for coming.

843
01:01:10,254 --> 01:01:12,381
Guess who's got a date
to the Last Splash?

844
01:01:14,091 --> 01:01:15,425
Me.

845
01:01:38,991 --> 01:01:41,910
Gently catch it. You break
your balloon, you're out.

846
01:01:42,119 --> 01:01:44,329
Okay, now toss it again.

847
01:01:44,538 --> 01:01:47,791
The idea is to keep
stepping back as you go.

848
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,003
Come on, people, you
could win a date with me.

849
01:01:52,045 --> 01:01:54,590
Good throw, man.
You ready for the heater?

850
01:01:56,466 --> 01:01:59,178
Oh, watch out. Be careful.
Heavy-handed.

851
01:01:59,386 --> 01:02:02,347
We go under, not over.

852
01:02:03,265 --> 01:02:04,725
Okay, take a step back.

853
01:02:18,071 --> 01:02:19,364
Ray, you're out.

854
01:02:19,573 --> 01:02:20,866
Come on, off you go.

855
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:27,206
I think I feel seasick...

856
01:02:32,169 --> 01:02:34,505
...but in a good way.
-Just be yourself.

857
01:02:34,671 --> 01:02:36,006
Minus the tail.

858
01:02:58,320 --> 01:03:00,864
-Hi.
-Hi.

859
01:03:02,407 --> 01:03:06,620
-Wow, you look pretty.
-So do you.

860
01:03:08,747 --> 01:03:10,165
Thank you.

861
01:03:10,374 --> 01:03:13,961
-What about we grab something to eat?
-Yes, I'm good at that.

862
01:03:14,753 --> 01:03:16,380
Okay.

863
01:03:17,506 --> 01:03:19,007
Here they come.

864
01:03:20,843 --> 01:03:22,719
-Hi, guys.
-Hey.

865
01:03:30,102 --> 01:03:32,646
-Come on.
-What can I get you?

866
01:03:38,026 --> 01:03:40,863
-I think I see where they went.
-Where?

867
01:03:42,698 --> 01:03:44,032
There they are!

868
01:03:55,794 --> 01:03:59,631
-Is that good?
-Yes. It's very calming.

869
01:04:00,424 --> 01:04:02,301
Okay. I'll try some.

870
01:04:08,140 --> 01:04:12,186
-No.
-That's good.

871
01:04:16,273 --> 01:04:19,651
To new things.

872
01:04:32,956 --> 01:04:35,834
Oh, sorry.

873
01:04:39,546 --> 01:04:41,256
Guess that's
an acquired taste, huh?

874
01:04:43,342 --> 01:04:45,093
They're having a genius time.

875
01:04:45,802 --> 01:04:49,181
-You look really pretty, honey.
-Thanks.

876
01:04:49,515 --> 01:04:52,017
-Hey.
-Hi.

877
01:04:52,351 --> 01:04:54,436
I see you and Claire
have made a new friend.

878
01:04:54,645 --> 01:04:57,564
Yeah, how about that? Another
person I get to say goodbye to.

879
01:04:58,774 --> 01:05:01,610
Ginny. Oh, Ginny.

880
01:05:01,819 --> 01:05:03,779
<i>I just read about you in the Tribune.</i>

881
01:05:03,987 --> 01:05:09,326
You didn't tell me you were one of,
what, 200 applicants. What an honor.

882
01:05:09,535 --> 01:05:11,954
I've been trying to land a grant
for 10 years.

883
01:05:12,162 --> 01:05:14,081
I just hope we can do
some good with it.

884
01:05:14,289 --> 01:05:16,041
Only the fish will know for sure.

885
01:05:16,416 --> 01:05:18,043
Aren't you happy for your mom?

886
01:05:19,169 --> 01:05:20,838
Ecstatic.

887
01:05:23,298 --> 01:05:24,883
Come on.

888
01:05:26,176 --> 01:05:28,303
Don't worry, honey.
You know how kids are.

889
01:05:30,973 --> 01:05:34,768
So, if you could travel anywhere
in the world, where would you go?

890
01:05:34,977 --> 01:05:38,105
That's easy. I would go to Fiji.
I hear it's amazing.

891
01:05:38,313 --> 01:05:41,275
-It is. It's unbelievable.
-You've been there?

892
01:05:42,317 --> 01:05:45,737
Well, I've been to lots of places.

893
01:05:45,946 --> 01:05:49,575
But I've learned it's not
where you are, it's who you're with.

894
01:05:51,285 --> 01:05:54,329
-You always so sure of everything?
-Yes.

895
01:05:55,706 --> 01:06:00,961
-More people should be like that.
-Well, some of us are only human.

896
01:06:08,135 --> 01:06:09,887
Thank you.

897
01:06:13,098 --> 01:06:15,559
Hey, how you doing?
Wow, thanks.

898
01:06:15,767 --> 01:06:17,936
Can you play Weezer's
"Island in the Sun"?

899
01:06:18,145 --> 01:06:19,688
Please?

900
01:06:20,564 --> 01:06:23,233
Yeah, sure, we can do that.
I love that song.

901
01:06:25,319 --> 01:06:28,864
Hi, everyone. We'd like to start
things off with a special request.

902
01:06:35,204 --> 01:06:36,955
I love this song.
You want to dance?

903
01:06:37,748 --> 01:06:40,417
I want to, but I don't know how.

904
01:06:40,626 --> 01:06:42,544
What? It's easy. I'll show you.
Come on.

905
01:06:42,753 --> 01:06:45,130
Come on.
You can't be worse than me.

906
01:07:09,905 --> 01:07:11,490
I told you I was bad.

907
01:07:11,698 --> 01:07:14,952
No, you're great, you're great.
That's okay.

908
01:07:16,286 --> 01:07:18,413
Here. You ever spend any time
in the water?

909
01:07:18,789 --> 01:07:20,332
Some. You know.

910
01:07:20,541 --> 01:07:24,127
Right. Okay.
So, you just got to kind of...

911
01:07:24,336 --> 01:07:27,256
...let the music carry you.
You know, just like a wave would.

912
01:07:29,007 --> 01:07:32,094
Wavy, yeah.

913
01:07:32,302 --> 01:07:37,141
There you go.
Yeah. There you go. Nice.

914
01:08:12,759 --> 01:08:14,469
I'll be right back.

915
01:08:17,890 --> 01:08:21,310
Back off. Don't make a bigger fool
of yourself than you already have.

916
01:08:32,446 --> 01:08:34,323
Walk away.

917
01:08:36,909 --> 01:08:38,452
Bye.

918
01:08:41,330 --> 01:08:42,956
Good job.

919
01:08:50,756 --> 01:08:53,634
-He's so into her.
-He likes her.

920
01:09:23,372 --> 01:09:25,958
Thank you, Capri Beach Club.

921
01:09:36,343 --> 01:09:38,595
Sunset. Come on.

922
01:09:43,058 --> 01:09:44,393
Dancing with you is...

923
01:09:44,601 --> 01:09:47,437
...better than anything
I've ever done on feet.

924
01:09:49,064 --> 01:09:51,066
Say goodbye.
It's time to go.

925
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:58,740
-I have to go.
-What? Again?

926
01:09:58,949 --> 01:10:01,493
Come on, at least stay for the fireworks.
Come on!

927
01:10:01,702 --> 01:10:03,996
There's going to be fireworks?

928
01:10:06,790 --> 01:10:09,501
I can't. I wish I could.
I really do.

929
01:10:09,668 --> 01:10:13,755
But you leave tomorrow.
I want to spend more time with you.

930
01:10:14,298 --> 01:10:15,841
What can I say to make you stay?

931
01:10:18,051 --> 01:10:20,053
You can tell me...

932
01:10:20,804 --> 01:10:24,016
-What? Tell you what?
-Aqua, we have to go right now!

933
01:10:25,058 --> 01:10:28,061
Tomorrow. Tomorrow you can tell me.
Come to the pier at 9:00.

934
01:10:28,270 --> 01:10:30,105
And tell you what?

935
01:10:39,031 --> 01:10:41,366
-You tell me how that makes you feel.
-Come on!

936
01:10:54,463 --> 01:10:56,715
I can't believe that I'm not that...
What?

937
01:10:59,468 --> 01:11:01,470
Come on, Hails.

938
01:11:27,162 --> 01:11:30,958
Okay, you little freaks.
What are you doing here?

939
01:11:31,166 --> 01:11:35,546
Cecilia, I want to go back to the party.
They're handing out sparklers.

940
01:12:40,861 --> 01:12:43,614
She lives in a water tower.

941
01:12:43,822 --> 01:12:46,074
Freak city.

942
01:12:46,366 --> 01:12:48,327
This is so lame.

943
01:12:48,535 --> 01:12:50,537
And who cares?

944
01:12:50,871 --> 01:12:53,248
I'm tired of sitting here staring at it.

945
01:12:53,457 --> 01:12:55,417
Yeah, Cecilia.

946
01:12:55,626 --> 01:12:59,755
We already missed the fireworks
and now we're missing the party.

947
01:13:00,547 --> 01:13:03,133
Patty, could you put away
the negativity...

948
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:06,053
...like you put away all the corn dogs
at the Street Fair?

949
01:13:07,971 --> 01:13:12,392
I'm going up.
If anyone comes, honk.

950
01:13:15,020 --> 01:13:17,856
But, I only had two.

951
01:13:26,865 --> 01:13:28,992
Who needs this?

952
01:13:38,919 --> 01:13:41,547
Here we go.

953
01:13:50,430 --> 01:13:52,599
What are you up to?

954
01:14:15,205 --> 01:14:16,832
Hailey?

955
01:14:20,586 --> 01:14:22,337
Is someone there?

956
01:14:40,314 --> 01:14:42,649
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

957
01:14:43,317 --> 01:14:46,111
Wait! Cecilia.

958
01:14:47,237 --> 01:14:49,656
Okay, okay.

959
01:15:08,467 --> 01:15:12,179
Nice and slow.

960
01:15:14,306 --> 01:15:16,475
She's a... She's a...

961
01:15:18,185 --> 01:15:20,604
She's a... She's a... She's a...

962
01:15:37,412 --> 01:15:43,961
You want something done,
you have to do it yourself.

963
01:16:00,352 --> 01:16:03,689
I need to see your hand stamp.
Thank you.

964
01:16:03,897 --> 01:16:05,524
Night!

965
01:16:05,858 --> 01:16:09,653
-Can I see your hand stamp, please?
-This is my hand stamp.

966
01:16:10,571 --> 01:16:12,531
-You know who I am.
-I'm sorry, Cecilia.

967
01:16:12,739 --> 01:16:14,658
Has grilling burgers fried your brain...

968
01:16:14,825 --> 01:16:17,911
...or do you grill all day
because you have no brain? Excuse me.

969
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:20,539
-Girls. Girls, girls, girls.
-Cecilia.

970
01:16:20,831 --> 01:16:22,416
Aquamarine. She's a mermaid.

971
01:16:22,624 --> 01:16:24,501
She has...
She has scales and everything.

972
01:16:24,668 --> 01:16:27,796
She has a big, fat tail!
That's why she lives in the water tower.

973
01:16:28,005 --> 01:16:30,090
Whoa! You need to slow it way down.

974
01:16:30,257 --> 01:16:32,885
-What are you talking about?
-You sound a little crazy.

975
01:16:33,093 --> 01:16:36,096
No, no, no. I'm not crazy.
I saw it with my own eyes.

976
01:16:36,305 --> 01:16:38,432
-You're freaking us out.
-There's no mermaid.

977
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:42,227
Why are you looking at me when
there's a mermaid in a water tower?

978
01:16:42,436 --> 01:16:44,605
There's no mermaid.

979
01:16:44,980 --> 01:16:48,025
Oh, okay, fine. And by the way,
why did you leave me there, huh?

980
01:16:48,442 --> 01:16:52,321
Do you have any idea
how far I had to walk?

981
01:16:52,779 --> 01:16:55,407
-She's crazy.
-Why is that funny?

982
01:17:00,078 --> 01:17:05,667
A mermaid.
A big, fat mermaid.

983
01:17:56,969 --> 01:17:58,679
I was quoted for 40 boxes, wasn't I?

984
01:17:58,887 --> 01:18:01,515
-No, it's 55.
-Fifty-five?

985
01:18:02,933 --> 01:18:06,770
-Bye, Mom.
-Hey. Be back soon, Hails.

986
01:18:06,979 --> 01:18:08,939
Daddy! Daddy!

987
01:18:09,148 --> 01:18:11,108
Daddy, it's so horrible.

988
01:18:11,316 --> 01:18:15,946
I went on my run this morning down by
the water tower and I heard this crying...

989
01:18:16,113 --> 01:18:19,825
...and this poor girl,
I think she's trapped up there!

990
01:18:20,033 --> 01:18:21,869
Did you call the police?

991
01:18:22,953 --> 01:18:24,621
I wanted to tell you first.

992
01:18:33,714 --> 01:18:35,257
Come in.

993
01:18:35,549 --> 01:18:37,759
-Hey.
-Hey.

994
01:18:42,264 --> 01:18:43,891
Will you take care of Moby?

995
01:18:44,766 --> 01:18:49,021
You won't have to go tomorrow.
Believe me.

996
01:18:49,688 --> 01:18:55,402
So I was thinking we should meet
at the pier at around 8:45.

997
01:18:56,612 --> 01:18:58,113
Hail?

998
01:18:58,280 --> 01:19:00,449
Are you listening to me?

999
01:19:03,827 --> 01:19:06,205
Maybe we should think
about the wish.

1000
01:19:09,583 --> 01:19:11,293
What do you mean?

1001
01:19:11,502 --> 01:19:13,504
We know
what we're doing with our wish.

1002
01:19:13,712 --> 01:19:15,547
You're staying in Bay Bridge.

1003
01:19:15,756 --> 01:19:20,636
Right. But I was thinking about it
all last night...

1004
01:19:23,222 --> 01:19:26,683
...my mom has worked all her life
for this. Maybe it's not fair.

1005
01:19:26,892 --> 01:19:31,688
We asked for a miracle, Hailey,
and we got it. We're using it.

1006
01:19:35,651 --> 01:19:37,820
Maybe we could wish
for something else, maybe.

1007
01:19:37,986 --> 01:19:41,657
Something else?
Like what? Like a new best friend?

1008
01:19:43,075 --> 01:19:46,954
-A new person to tell everything to?
-Claire, no. Stop it.

1009
01:19:47,162 --> 01:19:48,831
How can you even think that way?

1010
01:19:48,997 --> 01:19:52,501
I'm saying, maybe we'll learn
to stand on our own for a change.

1011
01:19:52,709 --> 01:19:55,337
-You mean me, don't you?
-I mean, I'm not your mom.

1012
01:19:57,172 --> 01:20:02,344
Please. You act like I need
you all the time, when the truth is...

1013
01:20:02,553 --> 01:20:04,304
...you're so mad at the world...

1014
01:20:04,513 --> 01:20:07,432
...that nobody but me
even wants to talk to you.

1015
01:20:09,434 --> 01:20:13,313
So you lived here your whole life. How
do you figure that I'm your only friend?

1016
01:20:22,489 --> 01:20:25,993

01:20:26,201 --> 01:20:28,745
<i>A report just in that a young girl
is trapped in the Bay Bridge water tower.</i>

1018
01:20:30,622 --> 01:20:34,459
<i>We'll be going live to Storm Banks,
the man on the scene.</i>

1019
01:20:34,668 --> 01:20:38,422
<i>This is Storm Banks reporting live
from Bay Bridge water tower...</i>

1020
01:20:38,630 --> 01:20:41,550
<i>...where an unidentified girl
has been trapped.</i>

1021
01:20:41,758 --> 01:20:44,136
<i>Firefighters are racing against time
to rescue...</i>

1022
01:20:44,761 --> 01:20:47,556
<i>-... this woman from a watery grave.
-Hailey, wait!</i>

1023
01:20:47,764 --> 01:20:50,642
Hailey, wait! Hailey!

1024
01:21:00,861 --> 01:21:03,489
-How'd you come across this?
-I was on my morning run.

1025
01:21:03,655 --> 01:21:07,784
All of a sudden, I heard this horrible
screaming. I didn't know what to do.

1026
01:21:07,993 --> 01:21:13,123
I did the first thing that came to mind,
which was to inform the newscast.

1027
01:21:13,332 --> 01:21:15,209
And we can only hope
that we find her.

1028
01:21:15,375 --> 01:21:17,920
-The ladder's gone.
-Oh, no.

1029
01:21:18,128 --> 01:21:21,590
I just did what any good citizen
would have done.

1030
01:21:21,798 --> 01:21:24,301
We can only hope
that they'll pull her out in time...

1031
01:21:24,468 --> 01:21:27,513
...so she can be reunited
with her friends and loved ones.

1032
01:21:27,721 --> 01:21:29,807
Hey. He's got something.

1033
01:21:30,015 --> 01:21:31,475
Okay, guys. Showtime.

1034
01:21:36,563 --> 01:21:38,524
Okay, you getting this?

1035
01:21:43,278 --> 01:21:45,405
We got a floater.

1036
01:21:45,989 --> 01:21:48,909
No. That's not possible.
No, she's up there.

1037
01:21:49,117 --> 01:21:51,578
-Okay, sweetie.
-She's up there.

1038
01:21:53,580 --> 01:21:54,915
They know what's going on.

1039
01:21:55,123 --> 01:21:57,125
-They know what's going on.
-Yeah, I know.

1040
01:21:57,334 --> 01:21:59,127
Tell them how she's up there.

1041
01:21:59,336 --> 01:22:01,505
She's probably still hiding
under the water.

1042
01:22:01,713 --> 01:22:03,340
-Go to commercial.
-Daddy.

1043
01:22:03,966 --> 01:22:07,010
You know why?
Because she is a mermaid.

1044
01:22:07,302 --> 01:22:12,015
-Go to commercial.
-Mermaid. Mermaid.

1045
01:22:12,224 --> 01:22:14,476
-Go to commercial, now.
-Fins and everything.

1046
01:22:14,685 --> 01:22:17,312
Are we out?
You've got to be kidding me.

1047
01:22:17,521 --> 01:22:18,939
Give me your keys.

1048
01:22:19,815 --> 01:22:21,650
-No, Dad. No.
-Cecilia.

1049
01:22:21,859 --> 01:22:24,403
-No, no, no. No!
-Cecilia!

1050
01:22:24,945 --> 01:22:28,574
Give me your car keys. Now.

1051
01:22:36,248 --> 01:22:38,250
While you're walking to school
every day...

1052
01:22:38,417 --> 01:22:41,253
...you can figure out
why you need so much attention.

1053
01:22:43,881 --> 01:22:47,551
-Where could she be?
-I don't know. Let's go.

1054
01:22:47,759 --> 01:22:50,387
That's a wrap... on my career.

1055
01:22:52,848 --> 01:22:56,435
-But, Daddy, my car.
-Yeah, save it, Cecilia.

1056
01:22:56,685 --> 01:23:00,564
<i>You know why?
Because she is a mermaid.</i>

1057
01:23:00,772 --> 01:23:02,107
<i>Go to commercial.</i>

1058
01:23:07,237 --> 01:23:10,991
There's not usually a man with a ladder
around when you need him.

1059
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:14,453
-I can't thank you enough.
-I guess I could say the same to you.

1060
01:23:15,662 --> 01:23:17,998
You're the first one
who talked to me all summer.

1061
01:23:18,999 --> 01:23:20,667
Well, at least nicely.

1062
01:23:21,585 --> 01:23:23,420
I appreciate that.

1063
01:23:34,848 --> 01:23:37,935
You're a long way from home,
aren't you?

1064
01:23:42,731 --> 01:23:44,608
Thank you.

1065
01:23:55,994 --> 01:24:00,624
You know, when you help a mermaid,
you get a wish.

1066
01:24:11,051 --> 01:24:13,095
It's almost 9:30 and she's not here.

1067
01:24:13,303 --> 01:24:15,597
-Where could she be?
-Don't say it's my fault.

1068
01:24:16,265 --> 01:24:18,225
-There's Ray.
-I can see that, thanks.

1069
01:24:18,392 --> 01:24:22,521
-What is your problem?
-I'm not giving up this wish, Hailey.

1070
01:24:33,991 --> 01:24:35,492
She's here.

1071
01:24:39,913 --> 01:24:41,248
-Hey.
-Hi.

1072
01:24:42,791 --> 01:24:44,418
I...

1073
01:24:44,751 --> 01:24:46,712
I thought about you all night.

1074
01:24:48,046 --> 01:24:50,674
-Good.
-Yeah.

1075
01:24:51,133 --> 01:24:56,305
So? What was it that you...
wanted to tell me?

1076
01:24:56,513 --> 01:24:58,182
Or ask me? I wasn't sure if...

1077
01:24:58,390 --> 01:25:00,893
Okay. Here it goes.

1078
01:25:01,226 --> 01:25:04,813
The last couple of days
have been amazing.

1079
01:25:05,022 --> 01:25:07,649
Yeah, but wait.
Before we get to that...

1080
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:11,820
...could you maybe give me
like a 20-minute warning...

1081
01:25:12,029 --> 01:25:15,073
...you know,
before the part where you run away?

1082
01:25:15,949 --> 01:25:17,826
Don't worry.
I don't have to leave yet.

1083
01:25:18,035 --> 01:25:22,748
Cool. Because, I was thinking
maybe we could go kite surfing.

1084
01:25:22,956 --> 01:25:26,168
Like, there's this really, really
awesome place right down the shore.

1085
01:25:26,376 --> 01:25:28,420
The waves are small,
but the wave itself...

1086
01:25:28,629 --> 01:25:30,672
-Wait.
-...breaks on the cove...

1087
01:25:30,881 --> 01:25:33,967
...it sprays up into the air and you can
always see a rainbow.

1088
01:25:34,134 --> 01:25:37,137
-It's cool... If you're into that.
-We're losing them. She's gonna ask.

1089
01:25:37,304 --> 01:25:39,431
-I'm into that kind of thing.
-I can't hear.

1090
01:25:40,307 --> 01:25:42,142
Come on, let's go up top.

1091
01:25:42,351 --> 01:25:44,603
-That's if you want to do that.
-I want to.

1092
01:25:44,812 --> 01:25:46,563
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

1093
01:25:46,730 --> 01:25:49,441
Cool. Because, afterwards,
I know this great little...

1094
01:25:49,608 --> 01:25:51,109
Actually it's a total dive...

1095
01:25:51,318 --> 01:25:53,946
...but they have the best hot dogs ever,
I swear.

1096
01:25:54,112 --> 01:25:55,447
-Raymond?
-Yeah?

1097
01:25:55,656 --> 01:26:00,285
-I have to ask you something.
-Right, right. Yeah. Okay. Shoot.

1098
01:26:01,495 --> 01:26:05,541
I came here looking for something
I wasn't even sure existed.

1099
01:26:05,958 --> 01:26:07,292
But...

1100
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:11,338
...then I met you
and now I have to ask you.

1101
01:26:11,547 --> 01:26:13,090
Ask me.

1102
01:26:13,298 --> 01:26:15,300
-Try the binoculars.
-Don't yell at me.

1103
01:26:16,718 --> 01:26:19,221
-Raymond?
-Yeah?

1104
01:26:20,139 --> 01:26:21,598
Do you love me?

1105
01:26:31,567 --> 01:26:33,360
Well.

1106
01:26:35,737 --> 01:26:40,284
I mean, we've had one date.

1107
01:26:43,203 --> 01:26:44,997
-What's going on?
-Don't get me wrong.

1108
01:26:45,164 --> 01:26:47,916
Don't get me wrong.
I like you. I really, really like you.

1109
01:26:48,375 --> 01:26:53,088
Wait, I think he's reaching out for her.
That's a good sign. Look.

1110
01:26:53,297 --> 01:26:56,383
I mean, I think you're smart,
and beautiful...

1111
01:26:57,134 --> 01:26:59,261
...and different than anyone
I've ever met...

1112
01:26:59,428 --> 01:27:01,555
...and I'd like to see a lot
more of you.

1113
01:27:01,763 --> 01:27:03,140
But...

1114
01:27:04,141 --> 01:27:06,226
...you don't love me.

1115
01:27:07,227 --> 01:27:10,814
-She's pulling away. Wait, no. Is she?
-Let me see what's going on.

1116
01:27:11,023 --> 01:27:14,109
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Wait, wait, wait.

1117
01:27:15,235 --> 01:27:17,196
Are you crying?

1118
01:27:17,529 --> 01:27:20,157
Yes. Apparently, it's something I do.

1119
01:27:20,365 --> 01:27:22,034
I don't understand.

1120
01:27:22,242 --> 01:27:25,412
Why do I have to be in love with you
today? Why can't we just...

1121
01:27:25,621 --> 01:27:26,955
...work our way there?

1122
01:27:27,122 --> 01:27:31,126
I have a better idea. Why doesn't she
just go back to where she came from?

1123
01:27:34,671 --> 01:27:36,173
-Oh, no!
-Aqua!

1124
01:27:36,381 --> 01:27:38,133
What the hell's the matter with you?

1125
01:27:59,321 --> 01:28:00,656
Oh, my God.

1126
01:28:04,493 --> 01:28:07,788
Raymond! Raymond!

1127
01:28:07,996 --> 01:28:11,458
Just stay calm. Don't fight the current.
I'll be right there.

1128
01:28:13,794 --> 01:28:15,838
He still chooses her over me?

1129
01:28:16,046 --> 01:28:18,298
She's a fish!

1130
01:28:21,426 --> 01:28:27,224
Aqua. Aqua, we're coming!
Her dad's pulling her back.

1131
01:28:27,558 --> 01:28:29,601
I'm going to get my rescue board.

1132
01:28:29,810 --> 01:28:32,146
-We can't just let her go.
-I'm going in.

1133
01:28:33,355 --> 01:28:35,065
No.

1134
01:28:37,985 --> 01:28:39,653
Not without me you're not.

1135
01:29:00,757 --> 01:29:02,092
Hailey.

1136
01:29:02,301 --> 01:29:04,470
Hailey.

1137
01:29:04,970 --> 01:29:06,638
-Come on.
-Hailey.

1138
01:29:07,890 --> 01:29:10,517
Grab the buoy.
We'll meet you there.

1139
01:29:15,022 --> 01:29:17,107
I'm right here. I won't leave you.

1140
01:29:17,274 --> 01:29:21,361
-Hailey, I can't.
-Keep your eye on the buoy.

1141
01:29:21,695 --> 01:29:23,614
Don't stop.

1142
01:29:30,120 --> 01:29:31,872
I'm coming.

1143
01:29:32,080 --> 01:29:33,957
-Grab my hand.
-Hailey.

1144
01:29:34,166 --> 01:29:35,626
You can do it.

1145
01:29:38,670 --> 01:29:41,840
I can't believe you two.
It's not safe out here.

1146
01:29:42,049 --> 01:29:45,469
-The storm's too strong.
-Why is your dad pulling you back now?

1147
01:29:45,677 --> 01:29:50,557
-He can't just take you away.
-Yes, he can. That was our deal.

1148
01:29:50,766 --> 01:29:52,184
Take our wish.

1149
01:29:53,310 --> 01:29:54,645
And you can stay here.

1150
01:29:57,231 --> 01:29:58,982
I can't.

1151
01:30:00,359 --> 01:30:03,654
Yeah, take it.
And you can call off your wedding.

1152
01:30:03,862 --> 01:30:06,323
-But there's no wish.
-What?

1153
01:30:07,449 --> 01:30:10,118
Raymond doesn't love me.

1154
01:30:10,536 --> 01:30:12,120
My father was right.

1155
01:30:12,329 --> 01:30:14,998
I couldn't prove love exists.

1156
01:30:15,207 --> 01:30:16,792
I'm so sorry.

1157
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,753
-Can't we do something?
-Yeah, anything.

1158
01:30:20,921 --> 01:30:23,715
What more could you do for me?

1159
01:30:23,966 --> 01:30:25,968
You jumped in the water to save me.

1160
01:30:26,260 --> 01:30:27,970
And now you'd give me your wish?

1161
01:30:28,178 --> 01:30:30,430
Why would you do that for me?

1162
01:30:33,225 --> 01:30:35,477
I don't know.
It's what I would do for her...

1163
01:30:35,853 --> 01:30:38,647
...and I know she'd do it for me,
and just...

1164
01:30:38,856 --> 01:30:42,109
...because we love you, Aqua.
-You do?

1165
01:30:50,325 --> 01:30:53,704
I didn't know you leak
when you're happy too.

1166
01:31:03,714 --> 01:31:05,174
Look.

1167
01:31:15,350 --> 01:31:16,852
Your dad's letting you go.

1168
01:31:17,060 --> 01:31:19,771
-Because of you.
-What?

1169
01:31:20,481 --> 01:31:25,152
Don't you see?
You just proved to him that love exists.

1170
01:31:28,238 --> 01:31:31,742
I guess you get a wish after all.
Any requests?

1171
01:31:36,622 --> 01:31:39,500
Can we wish for you
to stay here forever?

1172
01:31:41,877 --> 01:31:44,213
I'm a mermaid, Claire.

1173
01:31:44,588 --> 01:31:47,382
I have a family out there
that needs me.

1174
01:31:47,716 --> 01:31:51,053
As much as I want to stay,
I belong in the ocean.

1175
01:31:51,261 --> 01:31:53,180
Most of the time.

1176
01:31:57,100 --> 01:32:01,271
Save your wish, okay?
I promise I'll come back to visit.

1177
01:32:01,480 --> 01:32:04,942
And if I have to swim against
the Gulf Stream from here to Australia...

1178
01:32:05,150 --> 01:32:06,944
...I'll do it.

1179
01:32:07,820 --> 01:32:10,280
I'd circle the world for you two.

1180
01:32:28,215 --> 01:32:30,884
So I guess this is it, right?

1181
01:32:32,928 --> 01:32:36,473
Someone's got to go back
and return all those wedding gifts.

1182
01:32:37,975 --> 01:32:40,185
We're going to miss you, Aqua.

1183
01:32:42,688 --> 01:32:45,440
You can always call me on my shell.

1184
01:32:51,405 --> 01:32:53,448
I want you guys to have these.

1185
01:32:56,577 --> 01:32:58,036
Thanks.

1186
01:32:58,579 --> 01:33:01,748
Starfish may be big suck-ups...

1187
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:06,962
...but they never lie.

1188
01:33:12,718 --> 01:33:16,763
-Aqua.
-I love you guys too.

1189
01:33:17,222 --> 01:33:20,017
Aqua. Aqua.

1190
01:33:26,106 --> 01:33:29,860
-Oh, my God! Keep in touch, fish-butt.
-We want a full report.

1191
01:33:32,946 --> 01:33:35,157
I'll see you soon.

1192
01:33:35,365 --> 01:33:36,742
-Bye.
-Bye.

1193
01:33:37,367 --> 01:33:38,869
Bye.

1194
01:33:41,038 --> 01:33:42,831
-Race you to the pier.
-No, wait.

1195
01:33:43,457 --> 01:33:48,295
Let's just float a while.
I want to enjoy this.

1196
01:33:48,712 --> 01:33:51,173
Has this been the best summer ever
or what?

1197
01:33:51,381 --> 01:33:54,301
Just wait till next summer,
when you visit me in Australia.

1198
01:33:54,510 --> 01:33:56,553
If I can swing that
with my allowance.

1199
01:33:56,929 --> 01:33:58,514
Claire...

1200
01:33:58,680 --> 01:33:59,932
...we still have our wish.

1201
01:34:00,474 --> 01:34:01,809
Oh, my God.

1202
01:34:02,017 --> 01:34:03,519
You know what, Hailey?

1203
01:34:03,727 --> 01:34:06,355
It's good to have friends with fins.

1204
01:34:10,067 --> 01:34:11,693
Wait up.

1205
01:34:13,153 --> 01:34:16,323
Wow, I can't... I can't...
I can't believe it.

1206
01:34:17,199 --> 01:34:20,452
They didn't exactly cover this
in lifeguard training.

1207
01:34:21,662 --> 01:34:26,542
I know. I should have told you.
I hope you're not... mad.

1208
01:34:27,167 --> 01:34:31,713
No. No, I'm not mad.
Surprised, definitely.

1209
01:34:31,964 --> 01:34:34,091
And confused
about a couple of things.

1210
01:34:34,299 --> 01:34:38,887
Like for one,
the fact that you have a tail.

1211
01:34:39,930 --> 01:34:42,182
Yeah. I do.

1212
01:34:43,225 --> 01:34:44,685
A very nice one, by the way.

1213
01:34:46,478 --> 01:34:48,313
I know.

1214
01:34:52,067 --> 01:34:56,822
Are you planning to surface
anytime soon?

1215
01:34:57,447 --> 01:34:59,950
That sounds...
I don't know what I'm talking about.

1216
01:35:01,118 --> 01:35:04,955
I'm not sure how to ask
a mermaid out.

1217
01:35:05,289 --> 01:35:06,748
But I'd like to see you again.

1218
01:35:08,041 --> 01:35:11,962
If that's allowed or even possible.

1219
01:35:12,546 --> 01:35:15,466
Well, I have to swim back for a bit.

1220
01:35:15,674 --> 01:35:17,968
Clear the water with my dad.

1221
01:35:18,552 --> 01:35:20,637
Would you mind waiting a little while?

1222
01:35:21,472 --> 01:35:24,099
Maybe you could meet me
in Fiji sometime.

1223
01:35:50,459 --> 01:35:52,795
-Leonard?
-Good day, ladies!

1224
01:35:52,961 --> 01:35:54,296
Hey, girls.

1225
01:35:56,799 --> 01:35:59,551
-That's really sweet.
-I'm really happy for them.

1226
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:01,136
Hailey. Claire.

1227
01:36:03,430 --> 01:36:05,057
-Hi.
-Hi.

1228
01:36:05,682 --> 01:36:10,270
Look, I just had to tell you guys thanks.
You're both...

1229
01:36:11,647 --> 01:36:12,981
You're both extraordinary.

1230
01:36:13,857 --> 01:36:15,859
Don't know if I could've
done what you did.

1231
01:36:27,371 --> 01:36:28,997
See you.

1232
01:36:38,799 --> 01:36:40,843
Oh, my God.

1233
01:36:42,219 --> 01:36:43,720
Oh, my goodness.

1234
01:36:44,847 --> 01:36:46,890
I'll see you soon?

1235
01:36:51,895 --> 01:36:54,064
I'm going to miss you so much.

1236
01:36:54,773 --> 01:36:57,860
I know. I'm going to miss you too.

1237
01:37:06,535 --> 01:37:11,039
Hailey is so beautiful, inside and out.

1238
01:37:11,248 --> 01:37:14,251
She's the best friend
you could ever have.

1239
01:37:14,460 --> 01:37:16,628
Claire is so courageous.

1240
01:37:16,837 --> 01:37:22,259
Claire has a true heart.
She understands a true friend.

1241
01:37:22,468 --> 01:37:24,678
She will never let you down.

1242
01:37:24,887 --> 01:37:27,598
She glows from the inside.
