1
00:02:12,582 --> 00:02:16,739
<i>With the community still shaken
from last year's Slater's Quarry tragedy,</i>

2
00:02:17,182 --> 00:02:19,383
here in Boreham, it's fresh heartache.

3
00:02:19,483 --> 00:02:23,105
As the search for the missing women
moves into the end of its second day,

4
00:02:23,384 --> 00:02:27,640
hope is fading for Senator Kaplan's niece,
Juno, and her five friends.

5
00:02:28,683 --> 00:02:31,417
Just behind me I can see
one of the cave rescue teams

6
00:02:31,516 --> 00:02:32,651
emerging from the caverns.

7
00:02:32,751 --> 00:02:33,751
- Good luck, guys.
- Thanks.

8
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:35,449
<i>Chimney's pretty tight.
You all be careful in there.</i>

9
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:38,603
- Will do.
- Sir, any signs of the missing women?

10
00:02:39,683 --> 00:02:44,408
Do you think you'll find them alive?
How does this compare to Slater's Quarry?

11
00:02:46,718 --> 00:02:48,151
That's enough now.
Move back.

12
00:02:48,252 --> 00:02:50,286
Do you think you responded
quickly enough this time?

13
00:02:50,385 --> 00:02:52,247
- Greg, leave it!
- Greg!

14
00:02:55,151 --> 00:02:57,085
We're back on in 4 hours.

15
00:02:57,185 --> 00:02:59,478
- Get some sleep.
- You too, boss.

16
00:03:00,353 --> 00:03:04,419
- Hey, you want to share a sleeping bag?
- What's that cologne you're wearing?

17
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:07,718
Yeah, 6 hours of sweat and dirt
and all other kinds of shit.

18
00:03:07,818 --> 00:03:09,475
I think I'll pass.

19
00:03:10,153 --> 00:03:11,776
Lynch? What's up?

20
00:03:14,787 --> 00:03:15,877
What?

21
00:03:17,787 --> 00:03:18,944
Where?

22
00:03:23,153 --> 00:03:27,639
Look, get a tracker dog out there.
See if you can find where she came out.

23
00:03:28,487 --> 00:03:30,384
Yeah, all right, and...

24
00:03:31,354 --> 00:03:35,578
Let's keep the lid on this.
All right, I'm on my way to the hospital.

25
00:03:56,723 --> 00:03:59,323
- Right, Doc, how is she?
- She's resting.

26
00:03:59,423 --> 00:04:02,223
- We had to sedate her.
- I've got five girls missing

27
00:04:02,324 --> 00:04:04,490
and you put the one person
who knows where they are to sleep?

28
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,348
She was hysterical.

29
00:04:07,355 --> 00:04:10,443
Besides, she has no memory
of the last two days.

30
00:04:10,556 --> 00:04:13,451
Whatever happened to her, she's blanked it.

31
00:04:14,057 --> 00:04:17,249
- Injuries?
- It's only some minor cuts and bruises.

32
00:04:17,391 --> 00:04:20,158
But her clothes
were completely stained in blood.

33
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:22,415
- So it's not her blood?
- No.

34
00:04:23,091 --> 00:04:26,692
But she's been in a fight, all right,
because judging by her fingernails,

35
00:04:26,792 --> 00:04:29,778
she scratched some big chunks
out of somebody.

36
00:04:29,891 --> 00:04:34,752
Test her clothes, get the blood type.
Get the blood type of the other five girls.

37
00:04:37,558 --> 00:04:40,148
All right, let's see what you can do.

38
00:04:47,259 --> 00:04:48,723
Hello, Sarah.

39
00:04:53,194 --> 00:04:56,485
I'm Jenna Rios
from Hyde County Sheriff's Department.

40
00:04:59,326 --> 00:05:01,223
This is Sheriff Vaines.

41
00:05:03,994 --> 00:05:06,980
- How you feeling?
- Where am I?

42
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,189
You're safe.
You're at Hyde County hospital.

43
00:05:13,228 --> 00:05:16,214
We've been searching for you
and your friends.

44
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,386
Two days ago
you all set off on a caving expedition

45
00:05:21,495 --> 00:05:23,459
and you never came back.

46
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:27,922
We've been following
your Boreham Cavern flight plan

47
00:05:28,163 --> 00:05:32,680
but we found nothing.
Can you tell us what happened to you?

48
00:05:35,829 --> 00:05:39,279
I don't know. I can't remember anything.

49
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:46,120
Sarah...

50
00:05:48,069 --> 00:05:50,639
your friends are still missing.

51
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,959
And we need you to help us find them.

52
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:58,653
- Beth.
- Beth.

53
00:06:00,165 --> 00:06:02,026
What happened to Beth?

54
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:06,759
What can you remember?

55
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,786
What about Juno?

56
00:06:15,831 --> 00:06:17,024
Jessie.

57
00:06:18,731 --> 00:06:21,026
- Where's Jessie?
- Your daughter?

58
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:27,887
Sarah, Sarah,

59
00:06:29,432 --> 00:06:32,023
I need you to listen to me carefully.

60
00:06:34,233 --> 00:06:36,560
Your daughter isn't here, Sarah.

61
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,060
She died.

62
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:42,487
- A year ago, in Scotland.
- No.

63
00:06:44,834 --> 00:06:46,834
I know how hard this must be for you,

64
00:06:46,933 --> 00:06:50,759
- but you have to try...
- No, no. No! No.

65
00:06:52,834 --> 00:06:54,060
Come on.

66
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:40,100
This looks like the end of the trail.

67
00:07:42,904 --> 00:07:45,766
- What's that?
- That there's Chapel Mine.

68
00:07:52,404 --> 00:07:54,528
Cuffs, come here, come here.

69
00:07:56,204 --> 00:07:57,862
Go find them, boy.

70
00:08:08,906 --> 00:08:13,629
One of these days I'm gonna come up here
and help myself to some of this shit.

71
00:08:15,841 --> 00:08:18,894
What you found, boy? What you found?

72
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:28,033
Cuffs?

73
00:08:41,142 --> 00:08:42,471
Holy shit!

74
00:08:54,942 --> 00:08:56,342
- Sheriff.
- Dan.

75
00:08:56,442 --> 00:08:58,976
Keep it under your hat,
but we found one of the girls.

76
00:08:59,076 --> 00:09:00,976
Dog picked up her scent
near the old Chapel Mine.

77
00:09:01,076 --> 00:09:03,042
- That's the other side of the county.
- I know.

78
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:05,168
Jeez.

79
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:07,543
Don't tell me we've been looking
in the wrong place.

80
00:09:07,643 --> 00:09:09,844
Listen, I don't want to shift
the whole goddamn circus.

81
00:09:09,943 --> 00:09:13,943
I just want a couple of volunteers
to pick up where the dog left off.

82
00:09:14,043 --> 00:09:16,133
All right, give us an hour.

83
00:09:19,511 --> 00:09:21,600
Cath, Greg, rise and shine.

84
00:09:22,378 --> 00:09:24,864
Blood on Sarah Carter's clothes, A-positive.

85
00:09:25,745 --> 00:09:27,765
Juno Kaplan is A-positive.

86
00:09:28,611 --> 00:09:32,062
So? I'm A-positive.
Half the state is A-positive.

87
00:09:32,177 --> 00:09:34,039
- Can she walk?
- Sure.

88
00:09:34,511 --> 00:09:36,077
Wait, wait, you're not seriously
gonna take her out...

89
00:09:36,177 --> 00:09:39,164
Rios, get her dressed and get her in the car.

90
00:11:11,719 --> 00:11:14,018
My granddaddy used to work down there.

91
00:11:14,118 --> 00:11:17,787
One time, him and two of his buddies
broke into a whole new cave system.

92
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:19,248
Really big.

93
00:11:20,753 --> 00:11:24,320
Company bosses figured there should be
some rich pickings to be had,

94
00:11:24,419 --> 00:11:28,212
so they sent my granddaddy back down
to have a good look-see.

95
00:11:28,653 --> 00:11:30,378
He never come back.

96
00:11:31,686 --> 00:11:35,307
Folks reckoned they must've broke
clean through into hell.

97
00:11:36,586 --> 00:11:38,709
The devil was mighty pissed.

98
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:43,778
So you're telling me that there's
an uncharted cave system down there?

99
00:11:45,488 --> 00:11:46,611
Cool.

100
00:11:47,854 --> 00:11:50,181
There's a map of the mines here.

101
00:11:50,855 --> 00:11:53,953
If the caves are uncharted,
we won't even know where to begin.

102
00:11:54,053 --> 00:11:55,576
Bring the girl.

103
00:11:56,522 --> 00:11:59,678
Come on, Dan,
she's the only one been down there.

104
00:12:00,654 --> 00:12:04,488
All we gotta do is get a nod from her,
left or right. Narrows the search.

105
00:12:04,587 --> 00:12:07,089
There's a mountain full of caves
and fuck-all time.

106
00:12:07,188 --> 00:12:09,879
Could piggyback on the elevator cables.

107
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:14,155
You planning to go down there,
why not go down there in style?

108
00:12:14,255 --> 00:12:17,876
- What, this old shit still works?
- Sonny, let me tell you,

109
00:12:18,456 --> 00:12:22,782
this old shit-bucket will be working
long time after that MP3 of yours.

110
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:27,208
- Whatever.
- All right, Ed, get it going.

111
00:12:31,157 --> 00:12:34,347
I'm sorry,
but Mommy's got to help people tonight.

112
00:12:34,856 --> 00:12:38,808
Chica, when Grandma tells you
to go to bed, you go to bed, okay?

113
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:43,176
Honey, I love you.

114
00:12:45,091 --> 00:12:47,816
Okay, baby, I'll see you tomorrow, okay?

115
00:12:50,259 --> 00:12:54,153
Rios, get yourself kitted and get her kitted.
We're going down.

116
00:13:01,991 --> 00:13:04,922
Okay, Sarah, I know this is difficult,

117
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:09,049
but if you do this,
it could help jog your memory.

118
00:13:10,427 --> 00:13:14,412
Your friends could still be alive.
You have to help us find them.

119
00:13:26,161 --> 00:13:28,455
Hey, Sarah, this might fit you.

120
00:13:31,495 --> 00:13:36,047
You want to lose that heavy metal.
Gun blast down there'd be like dynamite.

121
00:13:36,761 --> 00:13:40,383
- Come on, I'll put them in the car.
- My gun stays with me.

122
00:13:45,162 --> 00:13:47,195
This is a missing persons case.

123
00:13:47,294 --> 00:13:50,815
What the hell do you think
you're gonna find down there?

124
00:14:12,129 --> 00:14:13,288
Mummy.

125
00:14:14,029 --> 00:14:15,994
Right, let's get moving.

126
00:14:26,197 --> 00:14:27,423
Come on.

127
00:14:33,099 --> 00:14:35,926
- You all ready to ride?
- Yeah, let's do it.

128
00:16:35,474 --> 00:16:36,630
Jesus.

129
00:16:48,908 --> 00:16:51,201
Hang on, just wait up a second.

130
00:16:58,075 --> 00:16:59,697
Here, drink this.

131
00:17:02,142 --> 00:17:05,162
She's okay. Let me worry about her.

132
00:17:07,642 --> 00:17:10,538
Come on, Dan,
let's get to the goddamn cave.

133
00:17:11,709 --> 00:17:15,398
Listen. Down here, I call the shots.

134
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:18,101
Is that understood?

135
00:17:19,076 --> 00:17:20,596
Loud and clear.

136
00:17:22,108 --> 00:17:23,368
Let's go.

137
00:18:08,113 --> 00:18:10,338
Should be a ladder down there.

138
00:18:12,448 --> 00:18:14,875
How long have I been teaching you?

139
00:18:17,146 --> 00:18:19,111
Your light is your life.

140
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,536
Hey.

141
00:18:24,448 --> 00:18:27,705
All right.
Okay, we've gotta go down another level.

142
00:18:29,013 --> 00:18:30,137
Greg.

143
00:18:41,548 --> 00:18:43,910
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

144
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:11,346
Is it okay?

145
00:19:11,482 --> 00:19:14,844
You know what's good?
Modern mines have metal props.

146
00:19:16,218 --> 00:19:19,407
- Miners prefer these old wooden ones.
- Why's that?

147
00:19:19,917 --> 00:19:24,039
The metal ones don't give you any warning
when they're about to go.

148
00:19:32,051 --> 00:19:33,381
After you.

149
00:19:43,318 --> 00:19:46,118
Okay, we should hit the cave system
somewhere up here.

150
00:19:46,219 --> 00:19:48,910
- Greg, go scout ahead.
- You got it.

151
00:19:51,752 --> 00:19:55,239
And Cath, you're next. Deputy.

152
00:20:05,554 --> 00:20:07,414
I think I've found it.

153
00:20:11,386 --> 00:20:13,249
What the hell is that?

154
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,377
It's a pit pony.

155
00:20:19,555 --> 00:20:21,280
Always a good sign.

156
00:20:40,022 --> 00:20:43,473
Check it out. This is awesome.

157
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:08,648
Greg, T.l.

158
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:17,044
Hey, hey. Don't... Don't touch anything.
This place is thousands of years old.

159
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:21,917
- Well, you're hot.
- Get away.

160
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:26,811
Sarah, do you recognize anything?

161
00:21:49,594 --> 00:21:50,718
What?

162
00:22:28,996 --> 00:22:31,891
It's okay. it's okay, she just got spooked.

163
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:44,154
Calcium deposits.

164
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:50,090
- Let's keep moving.
- It's okay, come on. Come on.

165
00:23:04,865 --> 00:23:05,887
Come on.

166
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:19,119
- Come on, Sheriff, you can do it.
- I ain't that old yet.

167
00:23:26,232 --> 00:23:27,561
Which way?

168
00:23:30,167 --> 00:23:31,893
You recognize this?

169
00:23:35,102 --> 00:23:36,861
Cath, have a listen.

170
00:24:29,771 --> 00:24:33,529
- Anything?
- I don't know. I think I hear something.

171
00:25:13,207 --> 00:25:14,365
Jesus!

172
00:25:14,607 --> 00:25:16,333
- Oh, my God!
- Shit!

173
00:25:16,708 --> 00:25:18,672
Fuck! Sarah. Look at me.

174
00:25:21,008 --> 00:25:24,992
- She's moving.
- No. There's no body heat. it's not possible.

175
00:25:38,342 --> 00:25:39,534
Deputy.

176
00:25:41,075 --> 00:25:42,563
- Okay.
- Sarah.

177
00:25:49,777 --> 00:25:51,569
She's been butchered.

178
00:25:53,044 --> 00:25:56,472
Six girls came down to this cave.
One came out.

179
00:25:57,211 --> 00:25:58,943
Covered in her friends' blood.

180
00:25:59,044 --> 00:26:02,076
Now, you tell me
what the hell happened down here.

181
00:26:02,176 --> 00:26:04,144
Wait a second. You think
she had something to do with this?

182
00:26:04,243 --> 00:26:05,778
- This is fucked up!
- Dan, get your team out of my face.

183
00:26:05,877 --> 00:26:07,345
- Man, you brought her down...
- Get off my back!

184
00:26:07,444 --> 00:26:08,932
Greg! Save it.

185
00:26:11,044 --> 00:26:15,011
I thought she was a victim here.
What are you saying now, she's a suspect?

186
00:26:15,112 --> 00:26:17,112
I think she knows something.

187
00:26:17,211 --> 00:26:21,511
I still got missing girls down here,
so let's keep our goddamn focus.

188
00:26:21,612 --> 00:26:22,747
I should never have let you
bring her down here.

189
00:26:22,846 --> 00:26:26,012
- I should never have let you!
- Dan, I think she came through here.

190
00:26:26,113 --> 00:26:28,837
All right, Greg, take point. Take point!

191
00:26:30,246 --> 00:26:33,445
- This is fucking bullshit.
- Deputy, look after her.

192
00:26:33,546 --> 00:26:36,169
It's okay. Come on, you're gonna be...

193
00:26:59,314 --> 00:27:01,835
Sarah, what is it?

194
00:27:06,848 --> 00:27:10,538
I think there's something down here.
We were attacked.

195
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:13,174
By what?

196
00:27:13,449 --> 00:27:16,449
There's nothing down here
that could have done this to a person.

197
00:27:16,548 --> 00:27:18,739
Sarah, what can you remember?

198
00:27:22,215 --> 00:27:23,374
Sarah?

199
00:27:24,949 --> 00:27:26,846
We shouldn't stay here.

200
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:31,045
You've got to try and think rationally.
You're scared.

201
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,579
Your mind's playing tricks on you.

202
00:27:34,116 --> 00:27:35,445
I'm through.

203
00:27:35,817 --> 00:27:40,018
It's about a 50-foot crawl with some
tight spots, and then it opens out.

204
00:27:40,117 --> 00:27:43,547
All right, copy that.
Sheriff, get your team together.

205
00:27:43,852 --> 00:27:47,746
Greg, we're coming through.
Look out for them at the other end.

206
00:27:49,817 --> 00:27:51,805
Okay, Rios, you go first.

207
00:27:52,151 --> 00:27:56,636
I want you in front of her. She's not
getting out of my sight from now on.

208
00:28:54,521 --> 00:28:57,144
Come on, you're almost there. Come on.

209
00:28:58,888 --> 00:29:00,615
Hey! Come on.

210
00:29:00,789 --> 00:29:03,203
You need to breathe with me now.
You need to breathe, okay?

211
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:11,085
Come on, keep it moving up there.

212
00:29:15,888 --> 00:29:18,375
Get a move on, you're slowing down.

213
00:29:26,057 --> 00:29:28,577
Why have you stopped? Get a move on!

214
00:29:31,491 --> 00:29:33,682
How are you feeling? All right?
Hey, hey, hey.

215
00:29:37,259 --> 00:29:38,326
Sarah... Sarah...

216
00:29:38,425 --> 00:29:39,515
Rios!

217
00:29:41,526 --> 00:29:42,682
Sarah!

218
00:29:43,492 --> 00:29:46,080
- Sarah!
- For Christ's sake, Rios.

219
00:29:48,558 --> 00:29:50,884
Which way did she go? Which way?

220
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,816
- Shit!
- It's okay. it's okay.

221
00:30:11,794 --> 00:30:14,690
That lady's a fucking psycho, Dan. Jesus.

222
00:30:16,127 --> 00:30:17,260
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

223
00:30:17,361 --> 00:30:20,661
- Look at me. How's it feel?
- You want to kiss it better?

224
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,848
- He's fine.
- Where's Vaines?

225
00:30:22,993 --> 00:30:26,979
- He took off after Sarah.
- Fuck! He doesn't even have a radio.

226
00:30:28,662 --> 00:30:30,961
Five minutes in these honeycombs,
they'll both be lost.

227
00:30:31,061 --> 00:30:33,194
Okay, listen to me, listen to me.

228
00:30:33,295 --> 00:30:35,229
We've gotta catch up on them
before they get too far ahead.

229
00:30:35,328 --> 00:30:39,122
This time, we stick together.
You understand? Okay, let's go.

230
00:30:39,895 --> 00:30:41,383
Yeah, come on.

231
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:20,820
Okay.

232
00:31:22,298 --> 00:31:24,232
Okay, there's falling rock here,

233
00:31:24,333 --> 00:31:27,318
which, as you know,
means the roof's unstable,

234
00:31:28,365 --> 00:31:30,884
so we have to tread carefully. Rios?

235
00:31:31,532 --> 00:31:34,154
You stick with me, okay? Let's go.

236
00:34:24,878 --> 00:34:28,965
- Cath, can you hear me?
- Take it easy, that's gotta last.

237
00:34:33,244 --> 00:34:34,731
Cath, come in.

238
00:34:35,612 --> 00:34:37,269
Cath, speak to me.

239
00:34:47,744 --> 00:34:50,469
- Dan, are you there?
- I'm here, I'm here.

240
00:34:51,211 --> 00:34:53,108
I'm here. Are you hurt?

241
00:34:54,713 --> 00:34:58,445
I'm stuck in a boulder choke.
And I need something to support the rocks.

242
00:34:58,545 --> 00:35:01,248
All right, all right.
Don't you panic, don't you panic.

243
00:35:01,347 --> 00:35:03,969
Listen to me. I'm gonna get you. Okay?

244
00:35:04,481 --> 00:35:07,771
We'll work at this end, all right?
You listen to me.

245
00:35:08,313 --> 00:35:10,641
You sit tight, we'll get to you.

246
00:35:12,213 --> 00:35:13,235
Okay.

247
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,074
Jesus. Come here, come on.

248
00:35:19,447 --> 00:35:20,672
Come on.

249
00:35:22,081 --> 00:35:24,476
Come on, come on, come on. Jesus!

250
00:35:25,681 --> 00:35:26,737
Dan.

251
00:35:28,847 --> 00:35:30,471
Come on. Come on!

252
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:36,474
- Fuck! Fucking trigger-happy Americans.
- Dan.

253
00:35:36,648 --> 00:35:39,315
Fucking only answer they've got
to anything is a fucking gun!

254
00:35:39,416 --> 00:35:40,782
Dan, don't let her hear you this way.

255
00:35:40,882 --> 00:35:44,182
There's a fucking ton of rubble between us.
She couldn't hear a fucking rock concert.

256
00:35:44,282 --> 00:35:45,338
Dan.

257
00:35:54,617 --> 00:35:55,603
Okay.

258
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:07,878
Okay. Okay, Cath.

259
00:36:09,284 --> 00:36:10,340
Yes?

260
00:36:13,617 --> 00:36:17,172
- We can't get through to you.
- Well, can't you drill it or det it?

261
00:36:20,318 --> 00:36:22,746
You know we can't.
It's too risky.

262
00:36:23,951 --> 00:36:25,708
You're gonna have to
work yourself free.

263
00:36:25,807 --> 00:36:28,054
I can't, Dan, it'll crush me.
I need you here.

264
00:36:35,418 --> 00:36:38,472
Okay, I'm gonna find another way
around to you.

265
00:36:40,552 --> 00:36:42,641
- Okay.
- I'll get to you.

266
00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:47,244
I'm scared, Dan.

267
00:36:48,952 --> 00:36:53,108
That's good, yeah? Fear keeps you alert,
it keeps you alive, it's...

268
00:36:56,652 --> 00:37:00,083
I promise you, I won't stop till I get to you.

269
00:37:01,188 --> 00:37:02,210
I know.

270
00:37:03,655 --> 00:37:07,913
- Maybe I should stay with her.
- You know we can't help her here.

271
00:37:14,989 --> 00:37:16,155
You hang in there, teammate.

272
00:37:17,755 --> 00:37:20,275
- No worries.
- Okay, Cath.

273
00:37:22,387 --> 00:37:23,375
Are you dry?

274
00:37:25,655 --> 00:37:27,882
- Yeah.
- So you'll keep warm.

275
00:37:29,123 --> 00:37:32,983
You keep drinking.
You stick with the drill, okay?

276
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:35,179
Okay.

277
00:37:36,157 --> 00:37:40,380
We're gonna have to move off now.
So you'll probably lose the signal.

278
00:37:41,856 --> 00:37:43,514
You stay positive.

279
00:37:45,556 --> 00:37:47,418
- Okay.
- Okay.

280
00:37:49,891 --> 00:37:53,512
We're walking away.
You stay on channel one.

281
00:37:54,858 --> 00:37:57,288
Okay. I'll be on channel one.

282
00:37:59,757 --> 00:38:01,280
You got your chance now.

283
00:39:37,898 --> 00:39:38,989
Shit!

284
00:39:42,264 --> 00:39:43,355
Fuck!

285
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:02,552
What the fuck?

286
00:40:26,467 --> 00:40:28,864
- Are these animal bones?
- Jesus.

287
00:40:46,769 --> 00:40:48,233
Dan! Dan!

288
00:41:07,471 --> 00:41:09,570
Here we are, morning after the night before.

289
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:12,471
- Here we go. Look at this face.
- Yeah.

290
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:14,070
Wake up, ladies.

291
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:15,295
I feel like a pig.

292
00:41:16,605 --> 00:41:18,505
- Now there's some water.
- It's not nice.

293
00:41:18,605 --> 00:41:21,704
- We all ready for this big, exciting day?
- Yeah.

294
00:41:21,804 --> 00:41:23,597
That's Juno.

295
00:41:25,739 --> 00:41:28,668
I'll believe that when I see it, all right?

296
00:41:29,472 --> 00:41:30,539
How you doing?

297
00:41:30,639 --> 00:41:32,626
- Yeah, I feel good.
- Good.

298
00:41:36,206 --> 00:41:38,172
- Recording for...
- For National Geographic.

299
00:41:38,273 --> 00:41:39,931
For National Geographic.

300
00:41:40,106 --> 00:41:42,106
- Once again...
- Recording our trip...

301
00:41:42,206 --> 00:41:45,507
- To Boreham boredom Cavern.
- How do you think Sarah's doing?

302
00:41:45,606 --> 00:41:50,125
Do you think she's ready for this?
I mean, she just seemed a little bit...

303
00:41:50,273 --> 00:41:52,000
You cut the camera?

304
00:41:56,074 --> 00:42:00,059
- Sarah?
- Put it away for, like, two minutes!

305
00:42:01,173 --> 00:42:03,105
- Where is that?
- I don't know.

306
00:42:03,942 --> 00:42:07,809
- Holly! Could you take a break?
- I just want to take a few more shots.

307
00:42:07,909 --> 00:42:09,842
This cave's a lot cooler than I thought.

308
00:42:09,942 --> 00:42:12,235
- This wasn't in the book.
- Good.

309
00:42:12,641 --> 00:42:16,161
Maybe that last jelly custard
wasn't a really good idea.

310
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:20,338
- How much further, do you think?
- Thank you very much.

311
00:42:20,775 --> 00:42:22,739
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

312
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:25,371
Okay, guys?

313
00:42:30,809 --> 00:42:32,467
Do you hear that?

314
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:38,371
Is that it?

315
00:42:41,043 --> 00:42:43,972
Dead animals, hundreds of them.

316
00:42:44,309 --> 00:42:45,844
- That's here.
- This is not good, guys.

317
00:42:45,943 --> 00:42:49,394
- Can we get out of here? Which way?
- That's this place.

318
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:53,143
- Come on. I don't know.
- What do you mean you don't know?

319
00:42:53,244 --> 00:42:56,199
There's no breeze! It could be
any one of these tunnels! Take your pick!

320
00:42:57,710 --> 00:42:58,811
Fuck it!

321
00:42:58,911 --> 00:43:01,034
- Hello!
- Please!

322
00:43:01,143 --> 00:43:03,369
Is there anybody there?

323
00:43:04,278 --> 00:43:05,471
Hello?

324
00:43:06,811 --> 00:43:08,672
What the fuck is that?

325
00:43:14,914 --> 00:43:17,342
Greg! Greg!

326
00:43:24,213 --> 00:43:26,233
Greg! Greg, where are you?

327
00:44:09,782 --> 00:44:10,838
Dan!

328
00:44:12,382 --> 00:44:13,369
Rios, you there?

329
00:44:13,583 --> 00:44:16,842
Dan, I'm here! Where are you?

330
00:44:20,081 --> 00:44:22,204
Dan! Where are you?

331
00:44:27,918 --> 00:44:28,972
Dan!

332
00:44:49,018 --> 00:44:50,108
Rios!

333
00:44:52,851 --> 00:44:53,940
Rios!

334
00:44:58,952 --> 00:45:02,007
Rios! Where are you?
Let me know where you are!

335
00:45:02,554 --> 00:45:04,177
I can't hear you!

336
00:45:06,719 --> 00:45:07,878
Sarah.

337
00:46:00,291 --> 00:46:01,878
You let him die.

338
00:46:14,824 --> 00:46:17,014
What the fuck was that thing?

339
00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:20,942
Don't worry.
It's just your mind playing tricks on you.

340
00:47:27,695 --> 00:47:30,090
Dan? Greg?

341
00:47:35,597 --> 00:47:37,221
Dan, is that you?

342
00:47:39,963 --> 00:47:41,755
Can you hear me, Dan?

343
00:49:38,237 --> 00:49:39,396
Sarah.

344
00:49:41,505 --> 00:49:42,561
I...

345
00:49:44,905 --> 00:49:46,237
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

346
00:49:46,338 --> 00:49:49,960
They're blind. They track sound.
You're louder.

347
00:50:56,409 --> 00:50:58,067
- Greg! Greg!
- Cath!

348
00:51:05,976 --> 00:51:07,838
Where's everyone else?

349
00:51:08,742 --> 00:51:10,331
We got split up.

350
00:51:11,411 --> 00:51:13,577
- What the fuck are these things?
- I don't know. I don't know.

351
00:51:13,677 --> 00:51:16,639
- I want my fucking torch.
- Shit. Sorry. Here.

352
00:51:20,643 --> 00:51:24,039
Is this okay? Okay? Okay. All right.

353
00:51:29,077 --> 00:51:31,099
Run. Run! Run!

354
00:52:13,248 --> 00:52:14,405
Jesus!

355
00:52:16,481 --> 00:52:17,536
Dan!

356
00:52:22,981 --> 00:52:24,639
Jesus Christ, Dan.

357
00:52:36,150 --> 00:52:38,806
Fuck. Fuck!

358
00:53:24,719 --> 00:53:26,206
Are you there?

359
00:53:26,786 --> 00:53:28,376
Can you hear me?

360
00:53:28,954 --> 00:53:31,110
Can you hear me?
ls there anybody out there?

361
00:53:31,385 --> 00:53:32,619
Come in! Anybody?

362
00:53:32,719 --> 00:53:33,911
Up! Up!

363
00:53:34,452 --> 00:53:35,474
Up!

364
00:53:42,054 --> 00:53:44,710
- Dan's dead.
- Turn it off. Turn it off!

365
00:53:45,820 --> 00:53:47,443
Come in. Anybody?

366
00:53:54,054 --> 00:53:56,349
Are you there? Can you hear me?

367
00:53:57,954 --> 00:53:59,869
Come on, can you pick this up?
Can you hear me?

368
00:54:07,655 --> 00:54:09,313
Dan? Dan, come in.

369
00:54:09,889 --> 00:54:11,853
Dan, it's Cath. Come in.

370
00:54:12,588 --> 00:54:15,246
- Dan's dead.
- Dan. Come in, Dan.

371
00:54:17,123 --> 00:54:20,722
- Vaines had his radio, Cath.
- We don't know that. We... He wasn't clear.

372
00:54:20,822 --> 00:54:24,650
- Dan? Dan, come in. Dan?
- Give me that. Give me. Give me that.

373
00:54:26,489 --> 00:54:28,114
I left him there.

374
00:54:29,224 --> 00:54:31,690
Those... Those fucking things attacked us
and I left him there.

375
00:54:31,791 --> 00:54:33,958
No. No, he promised he'd come back.
He promised he'd come back.

376
00:54:34,057 --> 00:54:36,079
I heard him scream, Cath.

377
00:54:38,157 --> 00:54:39,884
I heard him scream.

378
00:54:42,291 --> 00:54:44,152
He's gone, Cath, okay?

379
00:54:46,557 --> 00:54:48,454
No. No.

380
00:54:54,358 --> 00:54:56,550
I ain't gonna run out on you.

381
00:54:59,757 --> 00:55:02,449
You even try, and I'll kill you myself.

382
00:55:05,893 --> 00:55:08,583
We gotta move. Stay quiet. Come on.

383
00:55:23,327 --> 00:55:24,485
Jesus.

384
00:55:28,094 --> 00:55:29,614
- Fuck.
- Fuck.

385
00:55:31,659 --> 00:55:32,750
Fuck!

386
00:55:34,061 --> 00:55:36,547
- You'll have to jump.
- It's too far.

387
00:55:40,027 --> 00:55:41,889
Use her to get across.

388
00:55:46,994 --> 00:55:48,016
Go.

389
00:55:48,461 --> 00:55:49,996
- Fuck!
- We have no choice.

390
00:55:50,096 --> 00:55:51,583
Fuck! Fuck!

391
00:55:52,195 --> 00:55:53,217
Go!

392
00:55:59,630 --> 00:56:01,594
All right, push forward!

393
00:57:34,668 --> 00:57:35,827
Greg!

394
00:57:36,369 --> 00:57:38,356
Greg!

395
00:57:43,268 --> 00:57:44,597
Greg!

396
00:58:28,739 --> 00:58:31,362
Got washed out by the water last time.

397
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:35,527
I... I can't go down there.

398
00:58:36,574 --> 00:58:39,469
The water's flowing. There's a way through.

399
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:47,130
No, no. Wait. Wait, please.
Wait. Please. Wait!

400
01:00:24,380 --> 01:00:27,775
Sarah. Sarah. Sarah! Sarah!

401
01:00:31,947 --> 01:00:33,036
God.

402
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:37,434
No, no, no. Sarah!

403
01:00:43,313 --> 01:00:46,675
- Come. Come.
- All right.

404
01:01:00,882 --> 01:01:02,882
- It stops here?
- It's a dead-end.

405
01:01:02,983 --> 01:01:04,880
There's no way through?

406
01:01:05,849 --> 01:01:07,838
- No.
- Fuck!

407
01:01:13,483 --> 01:01:14,971
Fucking water.

408
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:03,407
Hi, baby girl.

409
01:02:04,952 --> 01:02:07,677
Hiya. it's Mommy.

410
01:02:11,887 --> 01:02:14,510
I... I just wanted to let you know...

411
01:02:17,021 --> 01:02:18,610
That I love you.

412
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:24,181
I want you to be good.

413
01:02:26,153 --> 01:02:27,414
And kind.

414
01:02:28,922 --> 01:02:30,284
And caring.

415
01:02:32,123 --> 01:02:34,416
I want you to be a good person.

416
01:02:38,190 --> 01:02:40,153
You're so special, baby.

417
01:02:44,023 --> 01:02:47,849
Te quiero, Te extraño, baby.

418
01:02:54,989 --> 01:02:56,717
My daughter's dead.

419
01:02:59,224 --> 01:03:00,416
I know.

420
01:03:06,025 --> 01:03:10,282
Everything you just said,
you tell it to her face. We're not dead yet.

421
01:03:11,858 --> 01:03:13,947
Come on. We'll keep moving.

422
01:04:43,063 --> 01:04:44,153
Juno!

423
01:04:47,764 --> 01:04:50,523
Juno, I'm here to help you.

424
01:04:51,831 --> 01:04:54,489
Get you out. You hear me?

425
01:04:55,931 --> 01:04:57,692
I'm here with Sarah.

426
01:08:15,679 --> 01:08:16,836
Sarah!

427
01:09:46,952 --> 01:09:48,177
God.

428
01:09:49,185 --> 01:09:51,046
What the fuck is this?

429
01:09:52,752 --> 01:09:54,216
I don't know.

430
01:10:22,054 --> 01:10:24,538
Now I wish I was back in the water.

431
01:12:00,993 --> 01:12:02,854
What are these things?

432
01:12:05,094 --> 01:12:06,251
Death.

433
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:27,414
Your friends, they're all dead?

434
01:12:28,695 --> 01:12:29,784
Yeah.

435
01:12:35,194 --> 01:12:37,362
How the fuck did you find this hellhole?

436
01:12:37,462 --> 01:12:40,913
Juno brought us here.
She wanted us all to discover it.

437
01:12:43,229 --> 01:12:45,954
She said she wanted to name it after me.

438
01:12:46,829 --> 01:12:48,793
- Why?
- Guilt.

439
01:12:51,863 --> 01:12:54,453
What happened between the two of you?

440
01:12:55,363 --> 01:12:56,725
My husband.

441
01:12:57,697 --> 01:13:00,127
She had an affair with my husband.

442
01:13:01,030 --> 01:13:02,823
What happened to her?

443
01:13:08,597 --> 01:13:10,788
It was just Juno and me left.

444
01:13:11,797 --> 01:13:16,725
Those things were coming for us,
so I hurt her so I could get away.

445
01:13:19,698 --> 01:13:21,925
She left my friend Beth dying.

446
01:13:23,899 --> 01:13:25,056
Alone.

447
01:13:26,631 --> 01:13:30,061
When I found Beth,
I had to put her out of her misery.

448
01:13:37,899 --> 01:13:39,488
Save your torch.

449
01:14:35,737 --> 01:14:37,529
No, Juno, wait! Wait!

450
01:14:38,203 --> 01:14:40,496
We came to get you out! Juno.

451
01:14:40,970 --> 01:14:44,331
Sarah brought us back down here.
She brought us back.

452
01:14:45,037 --> 01:14:47,501
Juno. Sarah is your friend.

453
01:15:00,470 --> 01:15:03,559
- So you're the rescue party?
- We're what's left.

454
01:15:05,506 --> 01:15:08,706
- Come on. We gotta get out of here.
- Okay, listen to me.

455
01:15:08,805 --> 01:15:11,792
Listen. Those things hunt above ground.

456
01:15:12,639 --> 01:15:16,506
I think I know which way they go.
They must have a route to the surface.

457
01:15:16,605 --> 01:15:17,907
So, let's go.

458
01:15:18,006 --> 01:15:21,162
Wait a minute, so what?
We go to where they feed?

459
01:15:22,572 --> 01:15:23,573
Are you fucking kidding me?

460
01:15:23,673 --> 01:15:27,363
Do you want to live?
Silence is your best weapon.

461
01:15:28,041 --> 01:15:30,341
- Follow me.
- We're following the water.

462
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:33,207
I ain't going in no goddamn water.
Juno knows the way out.

463
01:15:33,307 --> 01:15:35,240
So how come you're still here?

464
01:15:35,341 --> 01:15:38,667
Because my light died, I had no equipment,

465
01:15:38,940 --> 01:15:42,373
and my climbing partner put a pick
through my leg and ran out on me...

466
01:15:42,474 --> 01:15:45,164
There isn't time for this, God damn it!

467
01:15:45,274 --> 01:15:47,641
We want to get out of here alive,
we follow Juno.

468
01:15:47,742 --> 01:15:49,262
No fucking way.

469
01:15:49,641 --> 01:15:53,467
God damn it! I brought you
into this hellhole, I'm taking you out.

470
01:15:55,141 --> 01:15:57,162
- Wait!
- What? it's no good.

471
01:15:57,708 --> 01:15:59,570
- Chief!
- Shut up, Rios.

472
01:16:02,609 --> 01:16:03,971
Let's move.

473
01:16:26,278 --> 01:16:27,537
Come on.

474
01:16:46,345 --> 01:16:47,537
It's...

475
01:16:50,313 --> 01:16:52,503
We'll have to go single file.

476
01:17:10,346 --> 01:17:12,072
Spread your weight.

477
01:17:26,314 --> 01:17:27,837
Keep it steady.

478
01:17:35,649 --> 01:17:37,011
Easy, easy.

479
01:17:40,649 --> 01:17:42,847
We really should do this one at a time.

480
01:17:42,948 --> 01:17:46,015
You ran out on her,
but you ain't running out on me,

481
01:17:46,115 --> 01:17:47,841
so let's get going.

482
01:18:14,717 --> 01:18:15,807
Shit!

483
01:18:33,787 --> 01:18:36,545
- Help me!
- Give me the bag.

484
01:18:40,953 --> 01:18:43,279
Juno, help me, please! Juno!

485
01:18:55,454 --> 01:18:57,180
My arm! Pull me up!

486
01:19:01,853 --> 01:19:03,318
Grab my pick.

487
01:19:05,454 --> 01:19:06,954
Okay. Okay.

488
01:19:07,055 --> 01:19:09,887
- Cut.
- What? Cut what?

489
01:19:09,988 --> 01:19:11,822
Cut it, or they'll both die!

490
01:19:11,921 --> 01:19:13,681
Just fucking cut it!

491
01:19:18,188 --> 01:19:20,618
- Do it now!
- Wait! Wait!

492
01:19:38,922 --> 01:19:40,081
Hurry!

493
01:19:54,190 --> 01:19:55,349
Hurry!

494
01:20:11,260 --> 01:20:12,622
Fuck. Okay.

495
01:20:13,693 --> 01:20:15,180
We gotta move.

496
01:20:24,527 --> 01:20:25,922
We gotta go.

497
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:30,850
Rios.

498
01:20:34,694 --> 01:20:35,851
Sarah.

499
01:20:38,261 --> 01:20:39,520
Let's go.

500
01:24:00,442 --> 01:24:02,064
Come on. Come on!

501
01:25:07,311 --> 01:25:09,367
- I can't...
- No.

502
01:25:14,447 --> 01:25:16,104
I'm so sorry.

503
01:25:19,046 --> 01:25:20,907
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

504
01:25:21,679 --> 01:25:23,007
It's okay.

505
01:25:37,414 --> 01:25:38,572
Sarah.

506
01:25:41,680 --> 01:25:43,702
Sarah, we can't stay here.

507
01:25:48,916 --> 01:25:52,400
Sarah. We have to get out of here now.

508
01:26:03,948 --> 01:26:05,106
Sarah.

509
01:26:06,448 --> 01:26:07,640
Please.

510
01:28:31,958 --> 01:28:32,945
Come on.
