2
00:00:48,915 --> 00:00:51,213
Next question, Yamada.

3
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:57,181
What's the capital of
the United States?

4
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:05,325
New York?

5
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:09,129
Correct.

6
00:01:11,871 --> 00:01:14,431
I have a question, Miss.

7
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:19,970
What is it?

8
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:24,784
What's New York's capital?

9
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:34,325
Well...

10
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:44,602
Washington D. C?

11
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:50,375
You're naughty, Yamada.

12
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:56,811
I can't restrain myself
any longer, Miss.

13
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:03,346
Your mommy will hear us.

14
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:07,390
I don't care.

15
00:02:07,927 --> 00:02:11,863
I love you, Miss. I want you.

16
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:33,912
Have you always fantasized
about this?

17
00:02:34,787 --> 00:02:35,879
Yes!

18
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:43,625
I'm coming in!

19
00:02:43,796 --> 00:02:45,286
Here I come!

20
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:53,901
Yamada, you're incredible.

21
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:56,200
Am I? Really?

22
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:20,863
I'm so glad...

23
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,332
I'm so glad that I came here.

24
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:13,877
Here I come again.

25
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:46,947
Miss, I'm coming...

26
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:09,199
Amazing!

27
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:31,257
Oh, good heavens...

28
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:38,459
Sorry, Miss! I'm unprotected!

29
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,530
"Unprotected Sex Prohibited
1 million yen fine"

30
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,602
Don't worry.

31
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:50,545
I won't tell anybody.

32
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:53,175
Miss!

33
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:59,687
If you'd been my tutor, I would have
been accepted by a university.

34
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:05,290
Life is a learning process.

35
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:07,991
Come back again.

36
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,838
Hello, welcome.

37
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,817
What would you like?

38
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:04,915
An Orange Mocha Frappuccino.

39
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,319
Coming right up.

40
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:08,255
No, wait a minute...

41
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,760
An Iced Caramel Macchiato instead.

42
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,057
One Iced Caramel Macchiato.

43
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:19,067
Hello? Oh, it's you, Boss.

44
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:21,001
I'm at the meeting place.

45
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,074
You're at the table by the door?
Where?

46
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:28,776
But this is Chiaki Cafe though.

47
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:31,180
What? You're at Naomi Cafe?

48
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:33,284
Where is Naomi Cafe?

49
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,616
Bad transmission. I can't hear you.

50
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,623
Oh, no! I'm sorry!

51
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:44,887
Sorry! Are you okay?

52
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:51,365
No, don't wipe me with that rag!

53
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:52,899
Come this way.

54
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,338
Hello? I just tripped and fell over.

55
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,149
No! He's dead!

56
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:50,528
Cellular photo function!

57
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,408
She's hit!

58
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:09,679
Hello, are you okay?

59
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:11,440
Hello?

60
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:13,878
Hello?

61
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:25,762
Are y ou all right?

62
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:31,634
I'm fine.

63
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:35,238
Fine? You're bleeding though.

64
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:39,504
I'II call an ambulance...

65
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:42,372
Miss, wait!

66
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:45,210
Your bag!

67
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,421
Don't forget this.

68
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:04,565
You don't look okay...

69
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:51,182
What's wrong?

70
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:13,429
Why did you have to kill him any way?

71
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:22,046
What are you looking for?

72
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,312
- A finger.
- What?

73
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:31,047
A cylinder, the size of a finger.

74
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:40,197
That woman took it with her.

75
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:43,196
What do you mean?

76
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,800
The silver cylinder, right?

77
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:51,074
I thought it was hers.
I put it in her bag.

78
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:53,540
Why did you do such a thing?

79
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:58,677
I don't know.

80
00:12:00,686 --> 00:12:04,486
You're my old classmate so I'm
letting y ou use my cafe.

81
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:11,225
Do me a favor. Don't mess up my cafe
any more, OK?

82
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:15,663
Okay...

83
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:24,570
Not any more.

84
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:56,368
Hello? Sachiko?

85
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:59,375
Sachiko, what's going on?

86
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:15,092
I'm not kind, okay?

87
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:19,755
I'm not kind, goddamn it!

88
00:15:08,874 --> 00:15:11,206
Where am I?

89
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:20,677
What happened to me?

90
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:05,962
What the? Why?

91
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:43,260
The abstract form of the universe is
seen in terms of subjective truth...

92
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:51,968
Or is it objective?
Somebody tell me!

93
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:56,910
Hello? Are y ou all right?

94
00:17:04,623 --> 00:17:10,892
Sir... I think we should end this
relationship...

95
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:24,530
How about your problem?

96
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:27,303
You should end that relationship soon.

97
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:44,678
"Modern French Philosophy"

98
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:52,928
Hey, you! No reading without paying.

99
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:05,540
Maybe it's okay...

100
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:14,048
Girlie...

101
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:18,550
Do you understand
what you are reading?

102
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,788
This is fun...

103
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:24,727
Very interesting...

104
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:32,531
You look like this girl in
this photo.

105
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:36,836
Did you know this, old man?

106
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:40,274
The Count of Sandwich invented
sandwiches.

107
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:44,242
Of course! It makes sense.

108
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,443
Don't you think it's incredible?

109
00:19:49,154 --> 00:19:51,247
The wisdom of humankind!

110
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:57,495
Aristotle, Dante, Shakespeare,
Edison and Stravinski!

111
00:19:57,663 --> 00:19:59,927
E equals M multiplied by C square root!

112
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:04,432
All that is Man's passion released
towards the universe!

113
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:38,795
"Metaphysical Reality
by Prof. Toshio Saeki"

114
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:46,272
Why doesn't she come back?

115
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,739
Dirty dishes uncleaned...

116
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:54,581
Clothes not picked up...

117
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:58,112
What a sloth!

118
00:21:35,193 --> 00:21:37,024
Professor Saeki?

119
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:39,930
Yes?

120
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:42,457
I read your thesis.

121
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:45,432
Yes? What can I do for you?

122
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:51,169
Your views on metaphysical reality

123
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:54,244
overemphasis evidential rationalism.

124
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:55,710
Excuse me?

125
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:59,282
This subject lead Socrates to
commit suicide.

126
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:02,420
It also killed Christ and drove
Nietzsche insane.

127
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:05,418
Can binary structure explain
the universe?

128
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:12,325
You have a very interesting point...

129
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,724
Would you like some coffee?

130
00:22:16,134 --> 00:22:17,431
I'II do it.

131
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,402
DankeschÖn.

132
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:32,113
How much sugar?

133
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:34,013
No sugar for me.

134
00:22:43,161 --> 00:22:45,755
Descartes might have been right...

135
00:22:46,164 --> 00:22:51,761
Was Kant right when he speculated
that God existed on moral grounds?

136
00:22:56,308 --> 00:23:01,041
You... That's too much sugar.

137
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:12,551
It's not sweet at all!

138
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:15,686
It must be!

139
00:23:22,267 --> 00:23:24,792
Disgustingly sweet!

140
00:23:26,304 --> 00:23:30,502
Chaos theory is too simple to deal
with this subject.

141
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:34,872
It may not be comprehensible just as
Kierkegaard remarked.

142
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,438
What are y ou?

143
00:23:38,683 --> 00:23:40,742
This coffee has no taste!

144
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:50,121
No! You spilt it!

145
00:23:56,535 --> 00:24:00,027
Too much situationism and
not enough practicalism.

146
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:10,209
Too much situationism and
not enough practicalism.

147
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:25,088
Maybe the righteousness of God
is seen in human behavior

148
00:24:25,263 --> 00:24:30,963
as illustrated in Melville's argument
in "Moby Dick," n'est- ce pas?

149
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:33,001
I agree.

150
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:38,034
But not in the Milton way.

151
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:43,205
"Paradise Lost" lacks the material
base of pessimism.

152
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:51,284
You've got a point...

153
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:22,609
Melville approved...

154
00:25:22,787 --> 00:25:26,814
of innocence with a naive,
but sophisticated viewpoint.

155
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:33,392
You're right, it's unfathomable...

156
00:25:34,566 --> 00:25:39,799
It's a Naam Chomsky point- of- view.

157
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:44,131
The platonic view on Christianity...

158
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:47,574
How could I not see it, Professor?

159
00:26:04,262 --> 00:26:06,321
Pardon, I was quick...

160
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:13,601
I have a wife...

161
00:26:15,106 --> 00:26:17,370
She's a wonderful woman.

162
00:26:21,112 --> 00:26:26,049
So don't get me wrong.
I have no complaints about my marriage.

163
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:36,225
But she doesn't discuss Susan Sontag
or Noam Chamski with me...

164
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:43,965
Can I see you sometimes?

165
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:48,306
Too sweet...

166
00:26:48,473 --> 00:26:49,667
What's wrong?

167
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:53,000
I have a very sweet aftertaste in
my mouth...

168
00:26:55,814 --> 00:26:59,375
You put too much sugar in your coffee.

169
00:27:01,052 --> 00:27:03,452
But that was half an hour ago.

170
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:20,896
This is Ms. Sachik o Hanai.

171
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:28,775
She audits my seminars. Her home was
blown away by a tornado.

172
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:34,008
I'm okay now.

173
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:39,757
The memory of the red roof and green
grass under the blue sky of Kansas...

174
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:42,126
and Aunt Emily's loving eyes...

175
00:27:45,797 --> 00:27:51,292
She'II stay with us for a while
as Mamoru's tutor.

176
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:57,474
My son is kind of antisocial and shy...

177
00:27:59,911 --> 00:28:03,403
You're going to have trouble
dealing with him.

178
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,181
Please take good care of him.

179
00:28:12,724 --> 00:28:16,660
To explain pleasure from the
physiological point of view...

180
00:28:16,928 --> 00:28:22,298
Stimulation is relayed from the thalamus
and dopamines are secreted...

181
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:24,526
- Miss Sachiko?
- Yes?

182
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:27,297
What do I have to know all this for?

183
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:28,798
What do you mean?

184
00:28:28,973 --> 00:28:33,774
We live in a world where missiles
may attack at any given moment.

185
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,069
Missiles?

186
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:39,343
There's no capital city in the world
which is not targeted by ICBMs.

187
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:43,052
Everybody knows, but nobody
will admit it.

188
00:28:43,621 --> 00:28:44,952
You're right...

189
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:49,922
It's also true that you won't be
accepted by a university.

190
00:28:51,329 --> 00:28:54,355
Does anybody know what's real and
what's not?

191
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:56,530
You have a point there.

192
00:28:56,668 --> 00:29:01,264
Those who tell others to face reality
are usually not facing it themselves.

193
00:29:01,973 --> 00:29:05,568
But I think I'm as real as can be.

194
00:29:26,064 --> 00:29:28,259
Is sex real?

195
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:33,393
I don't know. The pleasure of it is
great even if it's virtual.

196
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:40,043
Not until you answer
the next question correctly.

197
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:19,841
Hello, delivery service.
Can I have your signature?

198
00:30:37,702 --> 00:30:39,192
You really scared me!

199
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:41,133
Oh, ouch!

200
00:31:19,777 --> 00:31:23,907
Dear Sachiko, I hope you're well
and healthy.

201
00:31:24,115 --> 00:31:26,413
Dad has stopped drinking.

202
00:31:26,584 --> 00:31:30,145
Enclased is some rice and
your favorite fish.

203
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:34,554
Come home for the new year's holiday.
Your Mother.

204
00:31:58,016 --> 00:31:59,074
This is good...

205
00:32:06,124 --> 00:32:08,217
Thank you Lord, Father in Heaven.

206
00:32:08,393 --> 00:32:13,057
We're grateful to be sharing this meal
with our guest tonight.

207
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,100
Let's eat.

208
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:35,846
It's hot!

209
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,385
Is it too spicy?

210
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:45,356
This is new...

211
00:32:46,364 --> 00:32:50,425
Sachiko, it's quite interesting...

212
00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:53,868
Thank you very much...

213
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:06,047
What the hell?

214
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:13,214
Sachik o, what's wrong?

215
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:15,385
Nothing...

216
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:20,425
But Naam Chomski is...

217
00:33:24,435 --> 00:33:28,166
Chomski's got nothing to do with this!

218
00:33:29,374 --> 00:33:30,170
I have to go!

219
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:32,669
Sachik o!

220
00:34:18,122 --> 00:34:21,558
Are you reading "Defense White Book?"

221
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:23,421
Oh, that?

222
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:26,358
I'm interested in military defense.

223
00:34:27,765 --> 00:34:32,361
Russia has deployed
7 Smirnoff ICBMs.

224
00:34:32,537 --> 00:34:36,871
China's building an aircraft
carrier with Japan's financial aid.

225
00:34:37,508 --> 00:34:39,169
You know very well.

226
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:41,537
You want to be a military commentator?

227
00:34:42,013 --> 00:34:45,881
We'II always have wars.
It's a good occupation.

228
00:34:49,887 --> 00:34:51,479
I see.

229
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:54,651
The deployment of
the TDF missile defense system

230
00:34:54,826 --> 00:34:57,260
is manipulated by
the Bush administration,

231
00:34:57,428 --> 00:35:01,728
the neo conservatism and
the military industry which supports it.

232
00:35:03,167 --> 00:35:06,625
Your learning curve is so steep!

233
00:35:08,005 --> 00:35:10,166
So it's time for Japan to

234
00:35:10,341 --> 00:35:14,038
come up with a nuclear strategic
defense concept.

235
00:35:14,212 --> 00:35:16,510
You're amazing!

236
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:27,048
It's hot!

237
00:36:52,443 --> 00:36:54,377
Red alert.

238
00:36:56,814 --> 00:36:58,281
Red alert.

239
00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:01,513
Red alert, Sachika Hanai.

240
00:37:03,421 --> 00:37:05,286
Who are you?

241
00:37:12,263 --> 00:37:15,721
I am the 43rd President of
the United States.

242
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:19,495
I have to warn you, Sachiko.

243
00:37:20,304 --> 00:37:22,499
The President!

244
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:27,143
World peace and
democracy are in danger.

245
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:29,643
It's time for you to act!

246
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:32,843
Why me? Leave me alone...

247
00:37:33,184 --> 00:37:37,314
Go ahead and see what you have in
your left pocket.

248
00:37:40,858 --> 00:37:42,189
Something's in there.

249
00:37:43,894 --> 00:37:44,883
There!

250
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:51,532
Do y ou know what it is?

251
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:57,030
What is it?

252
00:37:58,009 --> 00:38:00,170
It's my finger.

253
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:03,605
The finger that determines the
world's destiny.

254
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:06,345
It's a clone of my finger.

255
00:38:15,693 --> 00:38:16,489
Gross!

256
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:22,722
You can't escape from me.

257
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:28,500
I'm the champion af justice and truth.

258
00:38:30,007 --> 00:38:31,872
You can't escape from me.

259
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:55,659
You're naughty, Mr. President!

260
00:39:12,116 --> 00:39:14,084
I demand to have you '"inspected!"

261
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:17,685
I'm not waiting far the UN's decision!

262
00:39:28,165 --> 00:39:29,427
I got y ou, Sachiko.

263
00:39:35,806 --> 00:39:38,331
I'm going in deep.

264
00:39:43,514 --> 00:39:48,645
Once I'm inside you,
you can never escape from me.

265
00:39:48,786 --> 00:39:54,588
This is the finger that determines
the destiny af the world.

266
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:06,361
Is it getting better and better?
This is the Bush technique.

267
00:40:07,271 --> 00:40:08,966
I found the G spot!

268
00:40:13,611 --> 00:40:15,101
Here, Sachiko!

269
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,082
"Large scale Air Raid in Iraq"

270
00:41:03,194 --> 00:41:04,923
Shake it up, baby now!

271
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:08,225
He 's fucked up now, baby!

272
00:41:10,034 --> 00:41:12,093
Boys and girls of the world.

273
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:17,607
Did yau see the Hussein statue
being knocked dawn on TV?

274
00:41:19,109 --> 00:41:22,374
Nobady can beat my super weapon,
you know?

275
00:41:24,081 --> 00:41:27,244
It eliminates America's enemies

276
00:41:28,752 --> 00:41:33,052
and the enemies of the world
one by one, at pin- point precision!

277
00:41:34,024 --> 00:41:37,016
"Nuke 'em"'is an absolete fear.

278
00:41:37,194 --> 00:41:39,958
Little people, do not be concerned.

279
00:41:40,798 --> 00:41:47,397
My intention is to have
'"Nature Friendly Wars. '"

280
00:42:09,093 --> 00:42:11,152
"Shock and Awe!
US, UK Joint Iraq Attack!"

281
00:42:21,105 --> 00:42:23,335
"Kaiyama park"

282
00:42:23,507 --> 00:42:27,034
"The terrorists are hiding in a cave"

283
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:35,375
You're always being watched.

284
00:42:39,023 --> 00:42:41,992
God bless America!

285
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:46,223
You can never escape from me!
Never!

286
00:43:02,446 --> 00:43:04,209
I'm coming!

287
00:43:23,867 --> 00:43:25,357
Honey?

288
00:43:31,809 --> 00:43:33,299
Here I come...

289
00:43:38,415 --> 00:43:40,645
No, not that.

290
00:43:41,218 --> 00:43:42,947
What do you think of Sachiko?

291
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,553
Um... what?

292
00:43:46,223 --> 00:43:49,249
I know she's a very clever person...

293
00:43:50,728 --> 00:43:53,219
But there's something strange
about her...

294
00:43:53,597 --> 00:43:55,588
No, surely not...

295
00:44:03,407 --> 00:44:05,238
Who's Noam Chomski?

296
00:44:06,844 --> 00:44:09,244
Why are you bringing that up?

297
00:44:10,447 --> 00:44:13,245
Why are you so upset by that name?

298
00:44:13,417 --> 00:44:18,116
I'm not upset. He's just
an American scholar.

299
00:44:19,623 --> 00:44:23,423
You're lying! What are you hiding
from me?

300
00:44:23,861 --> 00:44:25,158
It tickles!

301
00:44:25,863 --> 00:44:30,129
Be quiet! Mamoru is still awake!

302
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:34,797
Be quiet.

303
00:44:49,086 --> 00:44:50,178
I finished!

304
00:45:00,297 --> 00:45:01,264
Correct!

305
00:45:09,473 --> 00:45:12,670
You're getting more and more
correct answers.

306
00:45:13,644 --> 00:45:14,611
Yes!

307
00:45:14,778 --> 00:45:16,837
This is the last question.

308
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:29,119
Correct.

309
00:45:29,827 --> 00:45:31,124
I did it!

310
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:52,174
Look. This is the fundamental law
of the universe.

311
00:45:53,317 --> 00:45:55,512
Nietzsche and Einstein.

312
00:45:55,686 --> 00:45:59,122
The Count of Sandwich. They all came
from here.

313
00:46:05,562 --> 00:46:08,087
It takes courage to
confront the truth.

314
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:13,960
I'm off to the study camp tomorrow...

315
00:46:14,671 --> 00:46:16,161
I won't see you for a while...

316
00:46:17,841 --> 00:46:18,899
Well then...

317
00:46:21,645 --> 00:46:23,909
I'II show you what I really am.

318
00:46:34,825 --> 00:46:38,090
What is that hole?

319
00:46:39,396 --> 00:46:40,920
Take a look inside.

320
00:48:11,288 --> 00:48:14,587
Wait... Aren't you feeling pleasure?

321
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:17,057
Oh, yes I am.

322
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:19,991
But you're not getting wet.

323
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:22,756
Your idea is illusionary.

324
00:48:23,934 --> 00:48:26,425
Step out of y our irrational state.

325
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:31,033
Practicarism surpasses
situationism.

326
00:48:46,623 --> 00:48:49,786
Can I turn off the light?

327
00:48:51,328 --> 00:48:52,454
Of course.

328
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:32,261
Oh, it's so good...

329
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:49,972
"Kaneda Investigations"

330
00:50:52,082 --> 00:50:56,018
I want y ou to investigate
who my son's tutor really is.

331
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:59,413
I see. What's her name?

332
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:01,554
Sachiko Hanai.

333
00:51:02,626 --> 00:51:06,323
Sachik o... Do you have her photo?

334
00:51:18,208 --> 00:51:19,505
This is her.

335
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:30,380
I don't want to be too demanding
but please be secretive.

336
00:51:32,556 --> 00:51:33,853
Of course.

337
00:51:42,799 --> 00:51:44,232
I'II be discreet.

338
00:51:50,407 --> 00:51:51,999
Where's Sachiko now?

339
00:51:54,544 --> 00:51:56,034
Does she live with you?

340
00:51:57,747 --> 00:52:01,239
I don't know
what you're talking about!

341
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:05,945
Stop!

342
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:34,699
Are you surprised?

343
00:54:38,375 --> 00:54:40,172
What's going on, Professor?

344
00:54:43,546 --> 00:54:46,640
Am I being too existentialistic?

345
00:54:49,386 --> 00:54:54,722
Let's discuss "The Waste Land" by
T. S. Eliot today.

346
00:54:57,427 --> 00:55:05,732
Or maybe "Styles of Radical Will" by
Susan Sontag?

347
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:08,763
Your wife will be back any minute.

348
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:13,605
She's at a women's meeting.
She'II be late.

349
00:55:13,943 --> 00:55:16,173
So don't worry. Talk to me.

350
00:55:16,913 --> 00:55:19,746
Say Noam Chamski.

351
00:55:22,619 --> 00:55:27,079
Please say Noam Chamski.

352
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:32,484
Let's say it together.

353
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:38,797
What's wrong, Sachiko?
You're different today.

354
00:55:42,405 --> 00:55:47,342
Would you like to try
dialectical materialism?

355
00:55:53,483 --> 00:55:57,476
I see things. I hear things, too...

356
00:55:58,955 --> 00:56:02,482
Every time I hallucinate,
I feel less and less.

357
00:56:04,227 --> 00:56:06,787
In the end, I'II feel nothing...

358
00:56:07,263 --> 00:56:09,026
You'II feel nothing?

359
00:56:09,733 --> 00:56:11,064
What are you talking about?

360
00:56:11,234 --> 00:56:12,565
I'II help you understand.

361
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:18,568
Professor!

362
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:40,260
Show me the finger.

363
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:57,011
Not that finger, idiot!

364
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:06,313
Open it now!

365
00:57:17,667 --> 00:57:18,998
Quick!

366
00:57:49,566 --> 00:57:51,295
You've been a pain in the ass.

367
00:57:58,208 --> 00:57:59,539
I'm going to kill you now.

368
00:58:00,944 --> 00:58:04,846
Don't you want to know whose finger
it is and what it's for?

369
00:58:05,248 --> 00:58:06,237
What?

370
00:58:07,584 --> 00:58:10,644
I know that you've just been hired
to find the finger.

371
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:13,789
Is this your attempt at staying alive?

372
00:58:15,058 --> 00:58:17,288
I don't think you will be.

373
00:58:18,261 --> 00:58:19,353
What do you mean?

374
00:58:20,396 --> 00:58:23,832
2 seconds from now, we'II both be
on the ground!

375
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:57,556
What is this thing?

376
00:58:58,167 --> 00:59:00,328
A finger cloned from the US President.

377
00:59:00,937 --> 00:59:01,869
What?

378
00:59:02,839 --> 00:59:06,275
To activate something that requires
his fingerprint.

379
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:08,074
What do you think it is?

380
00:59:08,912 --> 00:59:12,109
Something so important that they
want us all dead.

381
00:59:27,664 --> 00:59:30,030
I forgot to thank you.

382
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:33,558
For what?

383
00:59:34,404 --> 00:59:39,842
I ate the fish y our mother sent you.

384
00:59:41,077 --> 00:59:42,237
It was delicious.

385
00:59:51,454 --> 00:59:56,323
All forms of abstraction in the
universe are essentially infinite...

386
00:59:57,961 --> 00:59:59,121
What the hell?

387
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:13,598
And unaffected by
the Laws of Motion,

388
01:01:13,770 --> 01:01:16,705
in any objective reality or
subjective non- reality...

389
01:01:45,101 --> 01:01:50,198
One beef bowl with one egg
for the customer!

390
01:02:11,828 --> 01:02:13,125
Are y ou all right?

391
01:02:15,098 --> 01:02:16,122
I'm okay.

392
01:02:20,803 --> 01:02:23,670
Could you give me the finger?

393
01:02:24,107 --> 01:02:25,039
No way.

394
01:02:26,809 --> 01:02:30,210
Then you have to insert it
in the hole in my head.

395
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:32,341
I don't want to!

396
01:02:32,548 --> 01:02:35,483
You made this hole!
It's your responsibility!

397
01:02:52,969 --> 01:02:54,561
Don't be rough.

398
01:02:56,706 --> 01:02:57,900
Go easy.

399
01:03:19,862 --> 01:03:24,629
Drive along the coastline and
then go towards the mountains.

400
01:03:40,950 --> 01:03:44,317
We'II walk from here.

401
01:03:47,356 --> 01:03:51,554
Cogito, ergo sum...
I think, therefore I am...

402
01:03:55,398 --> 01:03:58,231
Don't try anything stupid
or I'II shoot you.

403
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:29,059
Deux Ex Machina,
God, I demand you to appear!

404
01:04:33,302 --> 01:04:34,667
Who are you talking to?

405
01:04:50,653 --> 01:04:51,642
This way.

406
01:05:09,472 --> 01:05:10,598
It's here.

407
01:06:49,505 --> 01:06:50,904
What in the hell is this?

408
01:06:54,110 --> 01:06:56,908
This is the Deux Ex Machina.

409
01:06:58,147 --> 01:06:59,944
The machine brought by God.

410
01:07:00,116 --> 01:07:01,378
Speak in Japanese!

411
01:07:02,651 --> 01:07:03,447
Watch out.

412
01:07:05,054 --> 01:07:07,454
That's no way to speak to
your teacher.

413
01:07:07,623 --> 01:07:08,954
My teacher?

414
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:13,027
Deux Ex Machina is the
Greek theater narrative device

415
01:07:13,195 --> 01:07:18,223
which solves an unsolvable plot
using supernatural force.

416
01:07:18,934 --> 01:07:23,098
Unnatural turns of events bring a
convenient solution.

417
01:07:23,272 --> 01:07:24,466
What's that mean?

418
01:07:28,711 --> 01:07:29,769
Look at this.

419
01:07:31,547 --> 01:07:33,242
A Russian keyboard...

420
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:37,349
It says "Uzbekistan" on the decal...

421
01:07:39,455 --> 01:07:41,082
What can you deduce from it?

422
01:07:43,159 --> 01:07:48,893
A Soviet- made military device
came here through the Middle East.

423
01:07:49,965 --> 01:07:50,954
Correct.

424
01:08:03,479 --> 01:08:04,776
What are you doing?

425
01:08:05,481 --> 01:08:07,108
For the correct answer.

426
01:08:09,919 --> 01:08:11,443
Question number 2.

427
01:08:13,989 --> 01:08:20,155
Which country has the largest number
of mass destruction weapons?

428
01:08:22,465 --> 01:08:23,454
America.

429
01:08:25,701 --> 01:08:30,229
Suppose if you could control all the
ICBMs with a push of a button?

430
01:08:35,778 --> 01:08:37,643
I think you know the answer.

431
01:08:40,583 --> 01:08:41,845
What is this?

432
01:08:43,152 --> 01:08:47,919
A remote control device for
the American ICBMs?

433
01:08:49,425 --> 01:08:50,551
Correct.

434
01:08:59,635 --> 01:09:04,368
Why does y our country, North Korea,
want this?

435
01:09:05,374 --> 01:09:06,932
With a remote control device...

436
01:09:07,776 --> 01:09:12,907
you access power equivalent to
the possession of nuclear warheads.

437
01:09:14,216 --> 01:09:15,183
Correct.

438
01:09:16,318 --> 01:09:18,377
North Korea wants this

439
01:09:18,554 --> 01:09:22,513
for political maneuverability
and to maintain Fascism.

440
01:09:24,693 --> 01:09:25,990
Oh, no...

441
01:09:27,663 --> 01:09:29,961
Which will it be? Bra or panties?

442
01:09:39,842 --> 01:09:43,278
You'd better escape from here.

443
01:09:58,260 --> 01:10:01,525
Zhuang Zi said, "Chaos died from
the seven holes."

444
01:10:02,298 --> 01:10:06,029
Back in the time of Han Dynasty
lived a god named Chaos.

445
01:10:06,502 --> 01:10:07,867
Chaos?

446
01:10:08,804 --> 01:10:11,136
And he had no facial features.

447
01:10:12,174 --> 01:10:15,769
No eyes, no ears, no nose,
nor a mouth.

448
01:10:17,246 --> 01:10:20,875
A magician called Dong fang Shuo
took pity on Chaos.

449
01:10:21,016 --> 01:10:26,921
The magician made 7 holes for
eyes, nose and mouth.

450
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:28,690
They're called the 7 holes.

451
01:10:29,725 --> 01:10:31,090
What's your point?

452
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:34,624
Now able to see, hear, smell
and speak

453
01:10:34,897 --> 01:10:39,664
Chaos suddenly died of shock.

454
01:10:40,636 --> 01:10:41,864
Died?

455
01:10:42,504 --> 01:10:43,562
Yes.

456
01:10:45,741 --> 01:10:49,074
What are you driving at?

457
01:10:49,678 --> 01:10:52,044
Chaos is nonsense.

458
01:10:52,314 --> 01:10:54,748
Nonsense is the law of the world.

459
01:10:55,050 --> 01:10:57,985
But you shouldn't try to change it.

460
01:11:27,016 --> 01:11:29,484
"North and South, Integrated"'

461
01:11:33,389 --> 01:11:36,381
Sachiko, give me a beer.

462
01:11:49,805 --> 01:11:52,467
Here, I love you.

463
01:11:53,609 --> 01:11:56,840
I love you too.

464
01:12:47,629 --> 01:12:48,857
I'm sorry...

465
01:12:56,305 --> 01:12:59,570
Ever since you made this hole
in my head...

466
01:13:00,943 --> 01:13:05,039
my senses have been mixed up
and weird.

467
01:17:26,942 --> 01:17:30,002
I've never failed to kill my target.

468
01:17:30,979 --> 01:17:34,073
You're the only one who survived
my bullet...

469
01:17:37,019 --> 01:17:38,247
It's my fault.

470
01:17:41,089 --> 01:17:44,490
It's okay. Do it right next time.

471
01:17:51,867 --> 01:17:56,395
Do you copy, K- 113? Do you copy?

472
01:18:00,342 --> 01:18:04,244
Your act of treason is based on
misunderstanding.

473
01:18:04,413 --> 01:18:07,940
Surrender before I count to 10.

474
01:18:09,017 --> 01:18:15,718
10... 9... 8... 7... 6...

475
01:18:16,491 --> 01:18:19,153
5... 4...

476
01:18:19,528 --> 01:18:23,555
3... 2... 1!

477
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:27,427
You should have this too.

478
01:18:30,539 --> 01:18:33,064
We have something more powerful
than this.

479
01:18:34,476 --> 01:18:35,704
No...

480
01:18:52,828 --> 01:18:53,920
You're insane!

481
01:18:54,930 --> 01:18:56,090
Don't!

482
01:19:17,052 --> 01:19:19,953
Behave yourselves!
Because I activated

483
01:19:20,756 --> 01:19:23,520
the missile launch system
on the USS Kitty Hawk!

484
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:27,754
Tok yo, Seoul, Pyongyang,
Huston, Yokosuka...

485
01:19:27,929 --> 01:19:29,988
I can attack any place I want!

486
01:19:45,113 --> 01:19:48,139
What is the meaning of your
stupid action?

487
01:19:49,484 --> 01:19:53,648
Are you trying to destroy
the whole world?

488
01:20:02,297 --> 01:20:07,394
Thanks to the hole that you made,
I experienced many unusual things.

489
01:20:09,404 --> 01:20:13,306
But these are the things
forbidden to us humans...

490
01:20:15,477 --> 01:20:17,843
That's why I have to die.

491
01:20:25,453 --> 01:20:26,681
No!

492
01:20:46,708 --> 01:20:48,005
No...

493
01:20:50,212 --> 01:20:51,611
Not now...

494
01:20:53,949 --> 01:20:57,282
- Order to move in.
- All units, move in!

495
01:21:32,354 --> 01:21:35,517
Huntington and
"The Clash of Civilizations"

496
01:21:35,690 --> 01:21:40,286
has no interrelation with existence
neither internally nor externally.

497
01:21:41,663 --> 01:21:43,392
Manager, stop!

498
01:21:43,765 --> 01:21:45,528
I need the money!

499
01:21:46,201 --> 01:21:47,759
For Bush's New World Order...

500
01:21:48,904 --> 01:21:50,838
Where has Mommy gone?

501
01:23:28,870 --> 01:23:29,928
Hello?

502
01:23:38,446 --> 01:23:39,708
Sachiko?

503
01:23:47,856 --> 01:23:50,347
Sachiko?

504
01:26:07,595 --> 01:26:09,825
Where are you from?

505
01:26:10,265 --> 01:26:15,032
I don't know... Maybe Tok yo?

506
01:26:15,203 --> 01:26:21,039
Good. How about Chow Mein?
I'II treat you.

507
01:26:21,209 --> 01:26:23,643
Really? Great.

508
01:26:23,811 --> 01:26:25,335
I'm so hungry.
