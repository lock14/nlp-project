1
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,510
Hey! It's me again.
This is a very special day.

2
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,832
This is day 756 of my college experience,

3
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,511
otherwise known as graduation day!

4
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,474
Wait for it. I got the whole outfit.

5
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,396
I have been planning for this day
for my entire life.

6
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,638
When I was a kid I devised this plan
that I cleverly called '"The Plan. '"

7
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,069
Uh...

8
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:35,759
This is great, because nobody runs
parental interference quite like Adam.

9
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,432
We've been best friends
since freshman year.

10
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,239
This is Ryden's Study Song

11
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,788
I worked on it so damn long

12
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,749
It's to give encouragement
for your big test today

13
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,593
Anyway, the plan
is pretty straightforward.

14
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:55,276
One, kick ass in high school so that
I can get, two, a fatty scholarship.

15
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,956
Three, limit my beer pong enough

16
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,237
to keep said scholarship,
which I did, and...

17
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:08,029
Hi, Ryden. Jessica Bard here.
Just wanted to clean the slate.

18
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,712
I'm sorry I nabbed valedictorian,

19
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,234
but you have to believe
I will do an excellent job.

20
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:16,074
Jessica Bard, my own personal
Darth Vader since the third grade.

21
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,471
Back to the master plan.

22
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,956
Number four, most importantly,

23
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,593
land a sweet job at the finest
publishing house in all of LA.

24
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,113
Happerman & Browning,

25
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,556
where I will no doubt discover
the next great American novel.

26
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,235
All right, so that's the plan. This is it.

27
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,953
Malby signing off,

28
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,589
about to embark on the first day
of the rest of my life, and...

29
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,793
Hey, if you're at graduation, come say hi.

30
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,030
I'll be the one in black. Bye!

31
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:53,032
You stumble down a yellow brick road

32
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,831
Spinning your shoes in the air
The air

33
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,592
Then you hold your breath
and count to nine

34
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:10,313
Hoping that soon
somebody will find you, find you

35
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:17,198
Go on, go on, go on
The stars are watching

36
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,593
Just say, just say, just say
What you're feeling

37
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:29,677
You know, you know, you know
You gotta take a bow and do it your way

38
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:35,357
It's okay, ladadadadadadadada

39
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,149
It's okay...

40
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:42,198
Please welcome your class valedictorian,
Jessica Bard,

41
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,236
with tonight's keynote address.

42
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,038
All right, Jessica!

43
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,032
Rock on, Jessie!

44
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,079
Class of 2009,

45
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,994
it is my great honor to welcome you
to this evening's graduation ceremony.

46
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,911
I stand before you
with two age-old words,

47
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,233
carpe diem.

48
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,436
When we walk out these doors,
I challenge each of us

49
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,436
to not only seize the day,
but to clutch it with both hands,

50
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,275
to squeeze it with all your strength

51
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,913
- and drain every last living...
- Could you move down just a little?

52
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,309
...breathing, victorious moment out of it.

53
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,430
Like when a Trojan
decides to plunge his blade

54
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,750
into the beating heart of his enemy.

55
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,112
He realizes it's not
for his own personal glory.

56
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,475
He does it for the better good
of the community as a whole.

57
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,239
We must remember

58
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,959
that our generation is smarter, stronger
and better equipped...

59
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,268
Ma'am! Could you keep it down?

60
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,669
...than any of those that came before us.

61
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:50,150
- And now, it is our responsibility...
- I'm dying.

62
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,554
...to forge ahead and stake
our rightful claim at the top.

63
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,354
- You know what? This calls for a toast.
- Mmm-hmm!

64
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,590
- What do you say, huh? Glasses up.
- Hear, hear. Yes.

65
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,398
- To Ryden.
- To Ryden.

66
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,755
- To Ryden.
- Who I'm very proud of.

67
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,156
Mmm! And to Adam,

68
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,478
the A-man,
who's here because we like him.

69
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,676
He's also here
because his dad was too busy to come

70
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:27,673
and his mom couldn't come because...

71
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,918
Because she's dead, and...

72
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,672
- Hear, hear.
- Cheers!

73
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,432
- Yeah.
- To your dead mother.

74
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,595
Cheers.

75
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,551
Anyway, honey, now that you're
out there looking for a job,

76
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,032
maybe you, you know,
come down and work with me.

77
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,309
Uh... She's already got something lined up.

78
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,391
Tell them about the big interview.

79
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,074
At Happerman & Browning,
Monday at 10:00.

80
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,673
- Wow!
- Hey!

81
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,797
And my thesis advisor
is best friends with the chief editor

82
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,836
and has already put in a good word
and everything.

83
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,309
And they are building
these loft apartments

84
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,277
like a block away from the offices,

85
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,316
so they have these sweeping city views.

86
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,197
I could walk to work.

87
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,232
Didn't I tell you?

88
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,957
What do you see over there?

89
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,911
What do you see, right here, on this wall?

90
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,475
White paint.

91
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,155
Bookshelves!
All my babies, floor to ceiling,

92
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,595
organized by title. No, by author.
No, by genre!

93
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,432
Okay. Settle down.

94
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,275
- It's amazing. I'll take it.
- Really?

95
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,555
- Really?
- Yes! I can feel it.

96
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,676
It's everything I ever imagined.

97
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,671
Hello! I love it!

98
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,149
Here, I've already filled out
the application.

99
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,391
All right, then. I'll need a check
for first and last month's rent,

100
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:46,074
plus security deposit, so $3,500.

101
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,313
Done and done.

102
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,356
Hey. Don't you think you're getting a little

103
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,238
- ahead of yourself there, killer?
- No. No, I don't.

104
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,311
- I will have enough money soon.
- Okay, well, right here

105
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,153
you wrote "Happerman & Browning"
under "employer,"

106
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,231
but you're not actually an employee
of them.

107
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,517
In a couple of hours,
that will be true, too, so...

108
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,558
- Maybe.
- Here you go.

109
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,838
Thank you so much. I'm hoping to start
moving my stuff in on Saturday.

110
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:16,674
Just as soon as I call your references
and your check clears.

111
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,997
Are we okay?
Do we have enough time?

112
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,469
Don't worry. We got plenty of time.

113
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,313
Hey, what's up with Columbia?
Did you hear back yet?

114
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,790
Uh... Big envelope, so, I don't know,
I guess I got in.

115
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,314
Wait. Adam.
You might've gotten into law school

116
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,039
and you haven't even opened
the envelope yet?

117
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,471
The shrug? Adam, you know how I feel
about the shrug.

118
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:47,155
Another shrug? Adam!
I got the double shrug?

119
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,196
Hey, this is your day, okay?

120
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,750
- Shit! Shit, shit, shit...
- Okay. No, calm down. Calm down.

121
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,717
You just calm down, all right?

122
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,473
My car! He killed my car!

123
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,033
No!

124
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,591
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
- No, calm down.

125
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,750
His insurance will pay for it.

126
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,709
It's fine, I'll take...

127
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,910
- Oh, shit.
- Shit!

128
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,549
Yes?

129
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,868
Happerman & Browning offices?

130
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,315
- Yes, 18th floor.
- Okay.

131
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,199
Excuse me, ma'am.

132
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,794
You got something going on right here.

133
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,473
Oh!

134
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,552
- Thanks.
- Yeah, sure.

135
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,514
Happerman & Browning,
please hold.

136
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,637
Happerman & Browning.

137
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,790
Yes, at 4:00. Thank you.

138
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,914
Happerman & Browning, please hold.

139
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:35,519
Hi, I'm Ryden Malby. I have an
interview with Barbara Snaff at 10:00.

140
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,830
Yeah, we're actually running
about two hours behind,

141
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,595
so just fill this out and have a seat
with the rest of the applicants.

142
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,637
Happerman & Browning.

143
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,189
Yes, at 4:00. Thank you.

144
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,879
Sorry.

145
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,829
Yes, Miss Snaff.
Right away.

146
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,039
Stacy Moore?

147
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,999
Joe Schrader?

148
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,072
Caroline Hirsch? Jeffrey Beales?
Kimberly Rice? Beth Brandon?

149
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,673
Barry Jenkins? Gregory O'Bryant?

150
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,911
Ryden Malby?

151
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,274
Hello.

152
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,354
- Please, take a seat.
- Thank you.

153
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,992
All right. You just graduated, yes?

154
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,878
- Yes, I...
- Major?

155
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,439
- English, with an...
- Minor?

156
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,714
- Communications.
- Internships?

157
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,109
I actually did three internships.
Penguin, Random House

158
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,555
- and Time Warner.
- And Time Warner.

159
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,474
So, why do you want this job?

160
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,875
Because this is not just a job to me.
This is...

161
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,473
This is what I love.
This is what I'm good at.

162
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,911
When I was 11, at summer camp,

163
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,353
all the other kids would go down
to the lake,

164
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,998
and I would be finishing
Catcher in the Rye

165
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,389
'cause I couldn't get enough
of Holden Caulfield.

166
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,710
And at 13, Bukowski's Post Office,

167
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,236
the most explicit, inappropriate thing
I'd ever come across.

168
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,517
It was like sex ed,
except awesomely foul-mouthed.

169
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,113
Well, I guess what I'm getting at

170
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:20,034
is that books are all I know
and everything I love,

171
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,396
and I want this job because...

172
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,790
Well, because I can't imagine
ever doing anything else.

173
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,554
All right! Good. Thank you for coming in.

174
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,799
I got it. Thank you.

175
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,551
- Jessica?
- Hi.

176
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,028
What are you doing here?

177
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,430
They just called me in for a little meeting.
Is that a bow? That's nice.

178
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,999
Jessica Bard?

179
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,389
- Barbara, pleasure to meet you.
- You, too.

180
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:03,553
Dean Brunswick just called me about you.
So glad I could fit you in.

181
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,199
Please.

182
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,953
I can get another job.
It won't be a problem.

183
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,632
I'm a college graduate!

184
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,678
Well, I didn't know you were
a college graduate.

185
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,679
Okay.

186
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,276
That Happerman & Browning thing,
it just wasn't meant to be.

187
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,952
You know that, right?

188
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,429
Yeah. It's fine.

189
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,716
You should eat one of these.

190
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,593
No, thanks.

191
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:47,078
You're turning down an Eskimo Pie?

192
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,519
- Mmm.
- Oh, come on. All right.

193
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,229
Every evil, terrible thing
that ever occurs in the world

194
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,073
is directly offset,
counterbalanced, if you will,

195
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:00,709
by the complete, utter joy
of biting into an Eskimo Pie.

196
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,072
It's the way we maintain balance
in the universe.

197
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,919
Come on.

198
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,790
- Does anyone ever say no to you?
- You do, all the time.

199
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,873
Okay, take a bite.

200
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,431
Mmm... Mmm-hmm.

201
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,555
Mmm.

202
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,869
Mmm!

203
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,075
Mmm!

204
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,199
Oh, yeah! It's like God's
just giving birth in my mouth!

205
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,870
Okay! That is the girl
that I fell in love with

206
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:39,794
but harbors nothing but platonic
feelings for me, unfortunately.

207
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:45,428
Your foot is freezing. It's 90 degrees
outside and your foot is freezing.

208
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,557
My feet are always freezing.
I have the feet of an 80-year-old man.

209
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,629
Ooh, that's hot.

210
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,511
Oh, so good.

211
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,636
Wait, wait, hold on.

212
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,479
Yes, yes, yes!

213
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,319
Dad.

214
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,517
Juanita. Wow.

215
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,594
Didn't recognize you
without the cash register.

216
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,113
Hi, Adam.

217
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,679
- What the hell are you doing here?
- That's funny.

218
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,751
I was just about to ask you
the exact same thing.

219
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,752
- It's my store.
- Come on, let's go. Sorry, Mr. Davies.

220
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,434
Wait, wait, wait.
Actually, I'm really glad you're here.

221
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,590
'Cause you haven't been home for a while,

222
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,955
and you definitely were not
at my graduation.

223
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,679
Look, I don't wanna get into this
with you right now.

224
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,273
Come on. It's time to go.

225
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,828
Wait. Juanita, I hope
he's paying you overtime for this,

226
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,230
'cause you do have rights.
You should call your union.

227
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,350
Well, welcome back home.

228
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,912
Bet you're excited.

229
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,075
Let's have a little look-see here.

230
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,552
There she is! Hi!

231
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,032
- Hey, Mom.
- She's home!

232
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,311
Oh, look at that, that's just a crime.

233
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,278
- Oh! Welcome back, baby.
- Thanks, Mom.

234
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,669
Oh, I'm so glad you're home.

235
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,715
Dad?

236
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,076
- That's gotta get to the shop.
- I'm not so sure.

237
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,232
- What are you doing?
- I'm just looking it over.

238
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,912
Gonna be all right.

239
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,719
Oh, no. No, no, no.

240
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,791
You're not thinking
about fixing this yourself, are you?

241
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,791
Yeah. Just have some faith
in my abilities, honey.

242
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,552
Usually there's a spot, if I can just hear it.

243
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,990
- But, Dad, you've never fixed a car before.
- Honey.

244
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,514
At one point I'd never roundhouse-kicked
a man in the neck before, either.

245
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,160
Now I do it every Wednesday.
My mind's like a sea sponge, honey.

246
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,356
When the synapses get going
in Walter Malby's mind,

247
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,192
boom, boom, boom. It's gonna be fun.

248
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,875
Don't worry about the car. I got it.
I got the car covered.

249
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,310
Let me give you a hand there, Adam.
Attaboy.

250
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,958
God, look at you, you're a self-starter.

251
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,395
Walter, Walter! Walter, Walter!

252
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,198
Watch your step there.
You should wear work boots.

253
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,635
There's a derby! There's a boxcar derby!

254
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,280
- Can we make a boxcar?
- Not now. Not now.

255
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,749
Pretty please? The derby's next month!

256
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,876
- Can we make a boxcar?
- Oh, jeez.

257
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,392
Son of a bitch.

258
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,510
Look at that. I knew it.
Son of a bitch. Third time!

259
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,997
Third G-D time! God damn it. That's it.

260
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,317
- Wait, Dad, where are you going?
- Walt. Walter, no, don't.

261
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,719
- Dad, come back here.
- Honey?

262
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,109
My foot. God damn.

263
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,114
We could go home and clean it off.

264
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,633
No, I gotta talk to him.
I'll talk to this guy.

265
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,597
You don't need to disturb him, though.
I mean...

266
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,595
- He's not home.
- This guy, I know he's not working.

267
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,956
I don't think he has a job.
God damn it, where is he?

268
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,519
- Hi.
- Hi.

269
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,554
Hey, hey, hey.

270
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,349
Your cat has now crapped
on my doorstep, in my yard,

271
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:44,399
and now on my driveway,
which around here is like church to me.

272
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,277
- Okay? That's sanctuary.
- Well...

273
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,470
I'm really sorry, sir. I am...

274
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,157
I'll talk to him. Yeah, I'll talk to him.

275
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,438
- See you later.
- Okay.

276
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,635
Today, you are getting a job.

277
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,274
Today, you're getting a job.

278
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,315
Today.

279
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,552
What do you say
when people turn you away?

280
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:22,110
Do you just turn your back
and quickly walk away?

281
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,988
Bop bop ba-da-da da ta

282
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,719
Bop bop ba-da-da da

283
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,833
Bop bop ba-da-da da ta

284
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,115
Bop bop ba-da-da da

285
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,710
The bottom line is,
what I lack in experience,

286
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,392
I make up for in vision.

287
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,959
And what I don't know,

288
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,031
I make up for with passion.

289
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,593
My world is on fire now

290
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,194
My world is turned upside down

291
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:55,192
and I don't know what to do

292
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,679
without you

293
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,998
I'm driven, full of ideas.

294
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,399
I'm upbeat.

295
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,869
Most importantly,
I am incredibly enthusiastic

296
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,757
about the work your company is doing.

297
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,637
Really? Like what?

298
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,828
Hunter, I hate getting these calls.

299
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,355
What did I tell you
about licking the kids' heads?

300
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,830
- Don't do it.
- That's right, ever, okay?

301
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,834
- Fine.
- I mean,

302
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,069
I know you like the way it tastes,

303
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,277
but some kids don't like
having their heads licked.

304
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,433
Hey!

305
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,118
How did it go?

306
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,270
I asked the VP if she was pregnant.

307
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:40,797
- No. She was just fat.
- Well, that's hard sometimes.

308
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,677
I'm gonna call my friend Betty
from high school,

309
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,079
she owns an indie publishing company,

310
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,037
and I'm gonna ask her for a favor.
I'm just gonna do it.

311
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,350
Dad already called her. Betty's dead.

312
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,759
Really?

313
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,273
- She died.
- That's a shame.

314
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,869
What is it?

315
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,351
- Oh, my God.
- What?

316
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,355
What do you guys think? This one?

317
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:12,437
Or that little mahogany number
I was in earlier?

318
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,031
Hey, Hunter, come here.

319
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:25,551
What do you think of Grandma spending
her eternal slumber in this one, huh?

320
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,273
I love it!

321
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:32,433
- Let's talk about casket ornamentation.
- Ornamentation?

322
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,795
Yes, casket ornamentation adds
a personal touch

323
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,632
many families find comforting,

324
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,429
and we offer a variety of custom corners
and commemorative panels

325
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,988
to highlight a loved one's passions.

326
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,753
Whatever you want, you could put it
right there on your commemorative panel.

327
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,876
It'd be right with you through the afterlife.

328
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,111
I'm just not sure
about all this. Thank you.

329
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:56,113
Really? What do I have to do
to put you in one of my coffins today?

330
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,748
How about a little
magnesium seepage protection system?

331
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,149
Whoa!

332
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,759
That's $18,000.

333
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,991
That's the exact same
corrosion and rust technology

334
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,799
that protects our Alaskan pipeline.
That's what that is.

335
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,832
That's $18,000.

336
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,313
You know, she's absolutely right.
I mean, why spend all that money

337
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,119
when there's probably
a nice local ditch somewhere

338
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,431
you could take me to
and dump me in for free?

339
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,988
Oh, Maureen, we'd never do that.

340
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,432
No, no, no, no!

341
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:42,999
Special delivery.
I got a cell phone, credit card,

342
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:46,472
student loan, and last but not least,

343
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:54,273
one more little item
I thought you might wanna see.

344
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,433
Look at that.

345
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,599
Come on!

346
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,239
Thanks.

347
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,108
Hey. Got an idea.

348
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,510
Since it concerns your future,
I need you to pay attention.

349
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,994
You listening?

350
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,913
- No. Dad...
- Listen to me. Listen to me.

351
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,353
Ready?

352
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,953
Buckles.

353
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,874
Buckles.

354
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,712
Yeah. Belt buckles.

355
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:31,830
Million-dollar niche business.
They're going crazy on the Internet.

356
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,354
Who do you think met a distributor,

357
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,553
is gonna start his own company?

358
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,996
But, Dad, what about The Luggage Shack?
They just made you regional manager.

359
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,197
You gotta think big picture here.
You gotta have vision.

360
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,032
You know what I'm saying?
You just gotta see the...

361
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:49,119
And since none of this other crap
is really working out for you,

362
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:53,550
more than likely,
gonna need a vice president.

363
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,393
VP.

364
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,594
You go out there
and drum up some business.

365
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,750
Come on, let's go out there
and put some buckles on belts.

366
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,273
What do you say?

367
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,874
Are you ever gonna actually open that?

368
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:22,588
It's made a long journey from New York.
I'm letting it breathe.

369
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,833
You know, Adam, if you don't wanna go...

370
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,876
Don't give me that shit.

371
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,478
- It's not like I'm gonna force you.
- No,

372
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:45,633
- you're just gonna hate me if I don't.
- No, I'm not gonna hate you.

373
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,631
I just want more for you.

374
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,588
Do you wanna be like me?

375
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:08,831
You wanna come home from work,
11:00 at night?

376
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:14,872
Save your whole life so you can afford
the mortgage on a place like this?

377
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,598
I'm going to bed.

378
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,233
It's a very funny thing, you know.

379
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,112
People keep calling me, but I'm like,

380
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:49,317
"Thanks, but I'm working
for Happerman & Browning.

381
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,756
"Make me a better offer, we'll talk."

382
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,149
- So, what are you guys doing?
- Me?

383
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,037
Charles Schwab, baby!

384
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,758
I'm going to San Jose, dot-com.

385
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,957
- Nice, man. You're going to...
- Pharmacy school, next month.

386
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,871
Yeah, so, what are you doing?

387
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,155
- What's your deal?
- I got into Columbia. We'll see.

388
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:08,676
Do it! Stay out of the workforce
as long as you can.

389
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:11,479
Ryden, what about you?
What are you up to?

390
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,788
I just...

391
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:18,120
You know, I've been interviewing

392
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,589
a lot.

393
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:23,878
And just had some
really amazing opportunities,

394
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,635
and just keeping my options open.

395
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,473
So what you're saying is
you're unemployed.

396
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,354
God. I feel like such a loser.

397
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,032
Everyone is doing something
with their lives,

398
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,396
and I just turn out to be
this big, pathetic loser.

399
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,992
- Come on.
- No, I don't want your pity hug.

400
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,032
Come on, Ryden.

401
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,108
It's okay,
you poor, poor, no-talent screw-up.

402
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,349
Oh, shut up!

403
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,908
You can joke about it.
You already got into law school.

404
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,833
- So?
- So, you're set, you're good, whatever.

405
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:05,152
Yeah, maybe I'm set and I'm good,
but does that mean I'm gonna be happy?

406
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,513
- Come here.
- Screw you, I'm not going in.

407
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,231
You don't have to go in. Just...

408
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,912
Come out here
so I can tell you something.

409
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,069
I don't think two people could be on this.

410
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,720
Okay, quit bitching and come out here.

411
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,274
Okay.

412
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,588
- Come all the way to the edge.
- What?

413
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,872
I'm celebrating.

414
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,788
I'm opening at The Mint on Friday.

415
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,472
- You are?
- Yeah.

416
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,437
- Shut up! Really?
- Yeah.

417
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,112
Adam! So you're going into music, then.

418
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,792
Why don't you just say that?

419
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,519
Well, because I'm not
saying that, necessarily.

420
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,794
- So you're going to law school?
- No.

421
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,030
I'm not saying that either, necessarily.

422
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,394
Well, then what are you saying,
necessarily?

423
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,072
I don't know what I'm saying.
All I'm saying is

424
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,628
that I'm opening at The Mint on Friday.

425
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:54,829
Yay!

426
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,556
Look, you got the hard part figured out.

427
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,596
You know what you wanna do.

428
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:05,309
Now you can just spend
the rest of your life going after it.

429
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,792
This one's popular
with all the college kids,

430
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,995
- and this one...
- No, I want that one.

431
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,957
And if you like them, you sell them all,
I got plenty more,

432
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,076
- even higher quality.
- Jeez, that's fantastic.

433
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:16,994
- I almost don't believe it.
- I am Hugo, the vampire.

434
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:20,436
- Not now, Hugo.
- Then help me build my boxcar.

435
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:23,080
I'm doing business now.
I'm doing business now.

436
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,799
- It's so lifelike.
- Yeah, named it after a real snake.

437
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,313
- All made right here in the country.
- All here.

438
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,550
Jeez, that's fantastic.
I'll call you about the rest of them.

439
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,596
- Thanks, buddy.
- Thank you.

440
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,313
All right.

441
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,435
Hey, who was that guy?

442
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,511
Here, honey, grab that box for me,
would you?

443
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,717
Carry it inside.
That's Gary. Gary the Buckle Man.

444
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,556
- So these are the buckles, huh?
- Yep, first shipment.

445
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,437
Hey, question.

446
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:53,872
As vice president, how would you like
to spearhead the marketing campaign?

447
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,031
- The marketing campaign?
- Yeah.

448
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,680
You know, ads and slogans and, you know,

449
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:02,036
maybe some clever ideas
for some of the buckles, like...

450
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,031
I don't know, what do we got here?

451
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:08,671
Look at this. Look at that one there.
That could be the Cobra, you know? Or...

452
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:13,359
I don't know, here. Look, here.
This could be the... Uh...

453
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,431
It's just the flag of Delaware.
I don't know.

454
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:19,308
But you know what I mean.
Just some thoughts, just ideas.

455
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,273
You know what I want
as vice president, Dad?

456
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,799
I want my car back.

457
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:29,639
I want to stop having to call a taxi
every time I have to leave the house.

458
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,593
Honey, I told you, the part hasn't
come in from the factory yet.

459
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,750
It's a curveball.
You're gonna get thrown curveballs.

460
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:37,149
Life and work are like baseball.
You can't rest at the plate.

461
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,800
- You gotta keep trying.
- But I am trying hard.

462
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:43,236
I mean, I am scouring the job market.
I am.

463
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:46,118
I'm getting up early,
and I'm searching for something,

464
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,873
anything to get my foot in the door.

465
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,155
Do you have any clue
what these interviews are like?

466
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,913
I mean, I'm constantly having to gauge
how I'm coming across,

467
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,036
all the while without a consistent form
of transportation

468
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:59,271
because you turned my car
into your latest science project.

469
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:03,069
So I really don't need to hear
that I'm not trying right now.

470
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:06,672
Well, maybe you're
setting your sights too high.

471
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:11,392
Oh, really? Well, where do you think
I should be setting my sights?

472
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,876
If you just give this one a chance,
I know you're gonna love it.

473
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:21,236
You just have to open it up, get in there,
check out all the pockets, and...

474
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,673
Ma'am? Sir?

475
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,598
It's on clearance!

476
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:33,796
Eye contact. Remember? We talked
about it. You gotta bring them in.

477
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,871
Okay? Honey, come on.

478
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,475
You gotta have a positive attitude
if you wanna sell suitcases.

479
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,629
Here, let me show you something.

480
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,233
Hey! How you doing?

481
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,949
Fine.

482
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:47,190
You headed out of town,
if you don't mind me asking?

483
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,669
- Yeah.
- Really? Where you going?

484
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,829
Maui.

485
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,399
Oh, wow, Hawaii! That's fantastic!

486
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,710
- You going there for business? Pleasure?
- Business.

487
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,268
No, don't say business.
Don't say business. Say pleasure.

488
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,952
Pleasure!
Why do you ask me the question, then?

489
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,871
Well, I'm trying to...
Here, look, let me show you, honey.

490
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,520
I'll do a little demonstration,
you know, right in here.

491
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,670
Like this. You point at the wheels
or something, you know.

492
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,749
It's like... You know what?

493
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,274
Those girls from Deal or No Deal.
You do that.

494
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,272
Maybe not so slutty,
but show, with the hand thing.

495
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,998
Here. Go ahead.

496
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,629
- Remember, eye contact.
- Okay.

497
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,188
- Look at the wheels! Look how they roll!
- There you go.

498
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,554
It's so nice.

499
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,949
There you go.
Hot potato, right here, right here.

500
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,837
Are you in the market for some...

501
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,148
Oh, crap!

502
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,669
- Hi.
- Hi.

503
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,910
I didn't know you worked here
at The Luggage Shack.

504
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,558
I don't work here. I...

505
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,478
It's temporary.

506
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,073
Right.

507
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,036
How's Happerman & Browning?

508
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,031
Oh, great. Really, really great.

509
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,395
They're sending me to New York
next week for a conference.

510
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,471
- Hence the need for a new briefcase.
- Sounds so great.

511
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:51,074
Now, I saw one over here last week
that I loved.

512
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,230
- Let me take a look at that black one.
- Up there?

513
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,548
Yeah.

514
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,353
There we go.

515
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,428
You know what? I wanna take a look
at the one right next to it.

516
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,637
Nope. I gotta trust my instincts
on this one.

517
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,190
I'm saying no to that one.
I'm going back to the original.

518
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,876
You know, things are moving
outlandishly quick for me right now.

519
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,154
Unbelievably fast.

520
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,312
I'll need a good team,
good people around me I can trust.

521
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,833
This is a no.

522
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,111
Now let me take a look
at this gray one here.

523
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,428
I thought you wanted a briefcase.

524
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,431
- I'm gonna need both.
- Mmm-hmm.

525
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,236
- Lot of traveling.
- Right.

526
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,068
- Okay...
- That's the one.

527
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:45,311
You know, Ryden, I think we've got
really good synergy, you and I.

528
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,516
You know, I know you're
in a tough place right now,

529
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:51,878
but I want you to remember that
struggle and strife come before success.

530
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,075
Even in the dictionary.

531
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:59,349
I'm not gonna take this one.
Can I see that black one up there?

532
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,319
You know what?

533
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,032
Dad? All yours!

534
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:15,636
Hunty, can't ride Momma's shoe
when she's trying to make waffles.

535
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:18,359
- Giddy-up!
- Come on, honey. Go play. Go.

536
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,837
Ride like the wind!

537
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,270
- Honey...
- What do you want, Maureen? What?

538
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:27,557
- Hunter is a very unique little boy.
- I don't want you to coddle him.

539
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:32,191
I am not coddling him, okay?
I'm just a little concerned

540
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,152
that he's weird.

541
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:41,554
Well, of course he's weird!
He's a Malby. Weird is good.

542
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,109
Weird indicates a creative force.

543
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,910
You have no idea
what I go through, okay? Trust me.

544
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,276
Hey, come on, I want to
show you something. Come on.

545
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,439
It is time!

546
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,633
No way.

547
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,390
- It's really fixed?
- Yeah!

548
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:36,233
Hey, man, your dad doesn't jerk around.

549
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,673
Watch this. Crack this hood...

550
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,272
Take a look at this.

551
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:49,913
- Now I'm gonna go fire her up.
- Okay.

552
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,718
Just look under the engine
and let me know what happens.

553
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,119
I wasn't really happy with the timing,

554
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:56,875
so I tweaked it a little bit.
Think I got her where I like her.

555
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,439
- Ready?
- Yeah.

556
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:04,235
Oh, it's great! Hey!

557
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,518
Just a little bit more, just a little...

558
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,669
Oh!

559
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,798
It just isn't fair.

560
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:28,950
There you are, this poor little innocent
thing who wouldn't hurt a fly,

561
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,998
and then one day you're murdered
by my own son.

562
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:35,478
It was an accident! Jeez!

563
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,434
Why didn't you tell me to look behind me?

564
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,192
What? How is this my fault?

565
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:43,034
Hon, you always have to keep your eyes
open. Scanning, constantly scanning.

566
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,270
- You told me to look at the engine.
- You can't do two things at once?

567
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:48,158
This is ridiculous. You hated that cat.

568
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,037
- Keep your voice down.
- Well, you did say something

569
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:52,793
- about wanting to flatten the cat.
- Okay! Okay! All right, fine.

570
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,438
It was a goddamn accident. I mean...

571
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:57,034
Either way,
somebody has to tell the neighbor.

572
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,750
All right. Jeez, I can't believe...

573
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,996
- Look out, look out. Oh, God.
- God...

574
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:11,675
Jesus. God damn... Even in death! Jesus!

575
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,200
- Ryden, go with him.
- What? No!

576
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,396
Come on, honey. Look at him.

577
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,233
All right.

578
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,070
- Oh, no, honey, don't do that.
- Hunter, don't do that. No, no.

579
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,872
- Dad!
- What?

580
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,790
- Why would you do that?
- Do what?

581
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,440
- That knock.
- What?

582
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,917
Of all the knocks, that one?

583
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,834
That one is the one you think best says,
"Sorry we killed your cat"?

584
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,751
Of all the knocks?

585
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:50,436
What do you mean, "Of all the knocks"?
How many knocks do you think there are?

586
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,190
No, seriously, how many knocks
do you think there are?

587
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,478
- Let's just make this brief, okay?
- All right.

588
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,313
Cat's dead.

589
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,591
Ran over him on accident.

590
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,433
We're really sorry.

591
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,752
- We didn't mean for it to happen.
- Where is he?

592
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,473
Part.

593
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,231
Let's part the way. Please.

594
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:26,909
Has the moon lost her memory?

595
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:30,552
She is smiling alone

596
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,270
In the lamplight

597
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:38,273
The withered leaves collect at my feet

598
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:45,350
And the wind begins to moan

599
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:51,392
Memory
All alone in the moonlight

600
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:55,509
I can smile at the old days

601
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:58,792
I was beautiful then

602
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,753
Sorry.

603
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,915
Honey?

604
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:17,755
Every streetlamp

605
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:21,077
Seems to beat

606
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:27,237
a fatalistic warning

607
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,998
Well, I gotta roll,

608
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,718
- so if you need anything...
- Come on. Up, up.

609
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,314
...here's my card. Okay?
- Attaboy.

610
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,279
Okey-dokey.

611
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,759
Hey. Listen, I'm really sorry about all this.

612
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:48,713
I can't tell you how sorry I am. I mean...

613
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,191
About your poor cat, and this...

614
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,790
Do you want some breakfast?

615
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,431
- What, right now?
- Yeah.

616
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,719
It's almost dinnertime.

617
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,720
Best time for pancakes.
Do you like pancakes?

618
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,910
- One more?
- No, I'm good, thanks. I'm full.

619
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,228
Do you not like my pancakes?

620
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,436
I love your pancakes, but I'm stuffed.

621
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,829
- All right. All right.
- All right.

622
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:16,115
No, no, no. You go sit.
Don't worry, I'll take care of it.

623
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,316
- Okay. Thanks.
- Yeah, yeah. Go.

624
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,470
You know, it's weird, I've never
seen the inside of this house before.

625
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:27,239
Yeah. Kind of unimpressive, isn't it?

626
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:30,234
No, it looks exactly like ours, actually.

627
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,437
Except you have cooler stuff.

628
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:36,638
Yeah, yeah, I direct infomercials.
So I end up taking everything home.

629
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,836
Like this. What is this?

630
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,273
- This?
- Yeah.

631
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,275
- A couch.
- That's a couch?

632
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,909
Yeah.

633
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,839
Super light.

634
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:13,074
And can even be used as a flotation device
in case of a flood.

635
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:17,276
Let's see, I have no car,

636
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:22,550
I lost my job peddling luggage,
and I now live with my parents.

637
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,710
- All right, living the dream.
- Yeah.

638
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,279
That's great.

639
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:32,312
Yeah, this whole post-graduation thing

640
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,198
is not exactly turning out
the way I planned.

641
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:39,271
I just thought I'd be doing
something amazing by now.

642
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,319
Or at least doing something.

643
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,799
Right.

644
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,719
Well, listen.

645
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:55,874
I know it doesn't solve the problem,
but if you need something temporary,

646
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,349
we could always use an extra P.A. On set.

647
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:02,115
You know, the hours are crap,
and the money is very, very bad,

648
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,589
but it'll get you out of the house.

649
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,589
Yeah.

650
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,753
- Yeah, that would be good.
- You got a job.

651
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,679
- Thanks.
- Cool.

652
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:19,677
But now, I think it's time for you
to start thinking about the good things.

653
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,959
Yeah.

654
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,273
Like what?

655
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:27,954
Like

656
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,999
your ears:

657
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,357
- Ears?
- Yeah.

658
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:37,313
- My ears?
- Yeah, you've got incredible ears.

659
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,039
Incredible?

660
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:44,029
Yeah. You know how some people
have that droop,

661
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:47,635
that sort of tragic dangling earlobe thing?

662
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,951
Yours, not so, no.

663
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,639
Not a single...

664
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,232
Just don't know why you had to give him
those cookies.

665
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:05,756
- We'll buy more cookies.
- You know they're my favorites.

666
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:17,791
Hey. Where's Ryden?

667
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,799
She's paying her condolences.

668
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,873
Fuck me.

669
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,599
Well, I would,
but somebody beat me to it.

670
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,108
Cool.

671
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,070
Listen, Dad,

672
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:59,477
I know that was
a little bit awkward, but I...

673
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:01,516
I just hope you used one.

674
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,474
- One what?
- You used something.

675
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:06,233
- That you used something.
- Something.

676
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,636
Used a... You know what I'm...

677
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,154
Used a rubber
or something like that.

678
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:13,391
- But...
- Protection!

679
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:14,674
Oh! Uh...

680
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,591
But we didn't...

681
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:20,190
'Cause I'm gonna tell you something,
herpes isn't a picnic.

682
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:22,236
It's not a river-rafting trip, either,
like they want you to think

683
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:24,072
- in the commercial.
- River-rafting...

684
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,633
Everybody's having fun
with their herpes out there.

685
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:28,678
- What?
- You know what? Lx-nay on the oodle-day.

686
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:31,310
- That's it.
- Oodle-day?

687
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,391
You know what I mean.
I don't want you near that... Don't...

688
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:36,074
Just stay away from the whole

689
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:40,510
- penile area.
- Dad.

690
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:43,236
Don't even see him anymore.
Don't even see him anymore.

691
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,799
That's it. You can't see him anymore.

692
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,509
Or what? What are you gonna do,
ground me? I'm 22 years old!

693
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,795
Oh, really? Well, you're forgetting
you live in my house.

694
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,509
Well, trust me, I'm doing
everything I can to change that.

695
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:07,673
- Yeah.
- Yeah? My name's Bill.

696
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:11,999
And I'm a little upset, to say the least,
if you know what I mean.

697
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:14,309
Okay.

698
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:18,231
Someone stole two boxes
of my Buckle-O-Bill belt buckles.

699
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,356
World renowned, uniquely crafted.

700
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,358
Word on the street is
you're trying to sell them.

701
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,431
You talking about this? This here?

702
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:29,035
No, no, no. I bought this legit
from Gary the Buckle Man.

703
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:30,553
I don't know Gary the Buckle Man!

704
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,835
I know you're trying to take food
out of my kid's mouth.

705
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:36,316
I don't even have a kid,
but if I did, you're taking his food!

706
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,231
- Uh-uh.
- I want my buckle!

707
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:39,753
Hey! Hey.

708
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:42,115
I need at least three feet
of personal space here.

709
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:44,873
- It's my buckle!
- I'm gonna paralyze you!

710
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:49,759
Crazy, man! It's my Delaware.

711
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,439
Two fingers. Two! That's all it takes.

712
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,590
I will call the cops, man!

713
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:13,233
Wait, so you're gonna be a P.A. Now?

714
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:16,478
It's just temporary.
Our neighbor hooked it up.

715
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:19,199
Wait, Rico Suave
from across the street?

716
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:22,279
That old dude
who wears the low-rise jeans?

717
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:24,954
What? He's 34, he's not that old.

718
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:27,793
Very specific information you have there.

719
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:32,314
Hey.

720
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:38,429
- So, uh, tomorrow night.
- Yeah?

721
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:40,317
I wrote
a little something-something for you.

722
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:41,628
- For me?
- Oh, yeah.

723
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:43,392
- Shut up!
- Yeah, you want a little sneak preview?

724
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:44,993
- Okay.
- Okay.

725
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:51,029
Ryden is beautiful, it's true

726
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:55,157
'Cause she's got eyes of blue

727
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:00,676
But then one day I tried to kiss you

728
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:02,752
And you said

729
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,508
'"Ugh! No! '"

730
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:12,509
- You're an idiot.
- You love me.

731
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:17,799
Anyway, so here's the deal.
Tomorrow night, me, you,

732
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:21,753
that dress.

733
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:26,748
Zip me.

734
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:28,308
Yeah.

735
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:33,154
So, first of all, I'm just gonna rock
the socks off everyone at that show.

736
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:35,276
Second, you're gonna throw
your bra on stage,

737
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:37,191
just scream like a little girl.

738
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:39,509
There.

739
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:46,914
And third, we're gonna go out
to a big, fancy dinner,

740
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,195
- with multiple forks, everything.
- We are?

741
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:50,599
- Yeah.
- Why?

742
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:55,389
To celebrate your new quasi-job thing.

743
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:57,518
Just to celebrate?

744
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:59,352
- Yeah.
- That sounds fun.

745
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:02,598
It sounds fan-crapping-tastic,
is what it sounds like.

746
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:08,432
Making guacamole for your family,
or just for yourself, used to be a fight.

747
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:12,399
But now, with the Guacanator,
the Guacanator 3000,

748
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:16,632
making guacamole is
as easy as uno, dos, tres!

749
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:23,278
Señor Avocado, he no stand a chance
against the grips of the Guacanator!

750
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:31,032
The only assault will be
against your taste buds!

751
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:33,999
Okay, cut! Okay, I got it. All right.

752
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,872
- And we're clear!
- This moustache is crap.

753
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,349
The hairs are going in my mouth.
I can swear I swallowed a couple.

754
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,749
I'm sorry. We'll take care of that
in a second, all right?

755
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:44,308
- Thanks.
- Okay, everyone, take five!

756
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:46,389
Take a fiver!

757
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,550
- There she is.
- Hey.

758
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:51,598
How's the first day going?
As shitty as I promised?

759
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:52,999
It's not so bad.

760
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:54,593
Well, just wait.

761
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,396
Bro. Hey, bro! Yo, dude.

762
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:00,070
Can I talk to you for a second
before you shoot anything else?

763
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,071
Well, this should be fun.

764
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:06,191
The script says "like a roadmap,"
but the roadmap...

765
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:08,350
Can you talk to the catering people?
The meat on this sandwich

766
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:10,112
- smells like ass crack.
- Okay.

767
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:14,637
So, first of all, you're really close,
so, congrats. Bones. Awesome, sweet.

768
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,836
We're getting so close,
but I just wanna go from the top.

769
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:19,559
Couple things
to make this double awesome.

770
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:21,153
Give me more Mexican.

771
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:23,993
I gotta get more Mexican,
you know what I mean? I gotta...

772
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:26,310
I wanna be on or across the border.

773
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:30,234
You know what I mean? Mexi-can,
not Mexi-can't or Mexi-could. Mexi-can.

774
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:33,357
Like, any of that flavor,
literally and figuratively into it,

775
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:34,714
awesome:

776
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:37,678
Second of all, your shots are boring, bro.

777
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:41,794
Seriously. Here's an idea.
Did you ever see The Matrix?

778
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:43,677
Movie about, like, alternative reality?

779
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,796
Okay, that shot, Keanu's, like, up in the air.

780
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:47,711
Bam, he's in the air, freeze.
360-degree shot.

781
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:50,592
Remember what I'm saying?
Yeah, like that.

782
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:53,114
That's exciting. That's awesome.
But, check this out,

783
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,760
instead of Keanu,
it's the Guacanator is up in the air,

784
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:58,832
and you shoot around it, like,
360, 720, like, change the axis,

785
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:00,194
like, people are
totally gonna blow their minds.

786
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:02,077
Right, Matrix, that's a great idea, yeah.

787
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,559
Thank you. I wasn't fishing for that.
I appreciate it.

788
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:06,473
- Maybe while I'm at it I could...
- Bring it, bring it.

789
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:09,393
Maybe we could hoist it up on a cross,

790
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:12,999
and we have
The Passion of the Guacamole.

791
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:16,033
Okay, I get it. Do you think that's funny?

792
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,597
I think you're an idiot.

793
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:20,593
And I quit.

794
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:23,393
Told you. Hollywood.

795
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:25,158
- Can you hear me?
- Let's go.

796
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:28,038
- I think I have the wrong channel. What?
- Let's go.

797
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:30,476
- What...
- Hey, hey, catch.

798
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:33,597
Hey, whatever!
All right, I'm gonna shoot this.

799
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:36,592
Can you put him back in the ring?
I got an idea.

800
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:38,398
- You're fired!
- Thank you!

801
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:44,629
Whew!

802
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:48,110
For years I had to deal
with this kind of stupidity.

803
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:49,758
Come on! Can you believe it?

804
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:53,753
I mean, you can't imagine how many times
I just wanted to walk off set like that.

805
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:55,751
Oh, my God, I just walked off set.

806
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:57,159
Yeah.

807
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:00,040
And it looks like I just lost another job.

808
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:04,238
Whew!
That feels good. That feels great!

809
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:09,713
Do do-do do do do do

810
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:12,439
Do do-do do do do do

811
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:15,438
Do do-do do do do do

812
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,719
'Cause I'm always where

813
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:30,190
I need to be

814
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:33,234
And I always thought

815
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:37,233
I would end up with you eventually

816
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:39,880
Do do-do do do do do

817
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:42,633
Do do-do do do do do

818
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:45,109
Do do-do do do do do

819
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,513
Can we go? Are you guys ready?

820
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:49,079
Who's your guy? Who's your singer?

821
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:52,436
- Yeah, he's right behind you.
- Hey, man, you're on.

822
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:04,193
You guys good?

823
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,560
So, my name is Adam Davies.

824
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:11,200
I hope this doesn't make anyone
too uncomfortable,

825
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:14,113
but I'm completely naked
under these clothes.

826
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:20,155
This song is for someone I care about a lot.

827
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:25,429
Ready?

828
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,430
I'm counting the streetlights

829
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,116
It's all I can do

830
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:54,238
While driving myself crazy
trying to get to you

831
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:58,555
Feels wrong at the right times

832
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:02,196
To reveal my hand

833
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:09,796
I'm doing the worst I can
to make you understand

834
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:15,754
Maybe one day you will know

835
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:24,597
How hard it is for me
to show my heart

836
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:32,392
With all the love
running through my soul

837
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:38,439
Maybe one day you will know

838
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:46,279
You know what I thought when I met you?

839
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:48,594
No.

840
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:53,315
"Aside from the incredible ears,

841
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:56,312
"she's smart, and stunning,

842
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,311
"absolutely stunning."

843
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,516
But there was something else.

844
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:05,314
I just saw a girl that has
the whole world at her fingertips,

845
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:07,550
and she doesn't even know it.

846
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:49,913
Good night.

847
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:05,479
Oh, my God.

848
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:09,033
I'm such an idiot. I completely forgot.

849
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:11,630
- It's cool.
- I'm so sorry.

850
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:14,199
How was it?

851
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,313
Great.

852
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,359
Fine, good...

853
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:21,318
And our dinner. I missed our fancy dinner.

854
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:25,676
You're getting overly worked up
about this, Ryden. It's...

855
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:27,434
It's cool.

856
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:32,236
Besides, you were clearly busy
with Pelé from across the street.

857
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:34,319
Oh, no, he...

858
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:37,278
We were at work, and then there was
this big blow-up, so we left,

859
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:39,157
- but it was...
- Awesome.

860
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:41,557
I'll see you later.

861
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:43,676
Wait, what are you doing?

862
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:46,797
- What does it look like?
- Just let me explain.

863
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:51,039
What exactly needs explanation?

864
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:53,031
The fact that I've been waiting
around like a moron,

865
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:56,715
hoping that one day you'll actually feel
about me the way I feel about you,

866
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:59,189
or the fact that you're
so obsessed with your future

867
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:01,111
that you completely forget

868
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:04,670
about everyone you're supposed
to give a shit about?

869
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:10,476
I'm not waiting anymore.

870
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:12,959
I'm done.

871
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:21,397
I may not know exactly what my future
looks like, but I do know one thing.

872
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:26,112
You're not in it.

873
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:59,117
...say can and will be used
against you, okay?

874
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:01,111
- I didn't know they were hot.
- You have the right to an attorney.

875
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,633
- Bought them on the Internet.
- If you can't afford one,

876
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:03,914
one will be provided to you by the state.

877
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,195
This is so stupid. I can't...

878
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:08,956
Didn't have to be this way.

879
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:10,833
Grab your brother,
get him in the car.

880
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:12,876
- I don't want him to see this.
- Come on, Hunter.

881
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:14,996
I had absolutely nothing to do with this.

882
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:18,476
You can ask anybody
and they'll tell you, I hate crime.

883
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:20,638
It's okay. It's okay.

884
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:36,588
The good news is
your husband doesn't have any priors.

885
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:38,398
The bad news is
we're gonna have to hold him.

886
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:41,074
Trafficking stolen property
is no small crime.

887
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:43,594
- The bail won't be set till tomorrow.
- You're keeping him overnight?

888
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:45,398
But he's not a criminal. He's just a moron!

889
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:47,152
That's the breaks.

890
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:53,230
I told you. I told you in 1976.
"Do not marry Walter Malby."

891
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:54,715
He's your son.

892
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:57,872
And I did the best I could with what I had.

893
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:01,191
Yeah, well, your best effort is in jail
till tomorrow morning.

894
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:06,070
Hey, pick up. I've called you 80 times.
I'm really, really sorry. I...

895
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,359
Call me back.

896
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:12,080
Where's Dad? I wanna go home.

897
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:24,870
How you doing? All right?

898
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:31,115
Mrs. Malby? Miss?

899
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:34,953
- Yes. Yes, hi.
- Hey, morning.

900
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:36,632
- Morning.
- How you doing?

901
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:39,359
So, basically, in order to bail him out,
you're looking at 15,000 bucks.

902
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:41,670
- Oh, my God. What?
- Or he stays in the slammer

903
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,716
- until the trial.
- Oh, God.

904
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:46,793
$15,000.

905
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:52,357
Well, let's go home.

906
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:55,633
- Maureen?
- What?

907
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:57,075
Wait.

908
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:00,033
Cough it up.

909
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:01,879
Cough what up?

910
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,869
Pay the man your son's bail money.

911
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:07,428
Are you crazy?

912
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:10,793
You think if I had that kind of dough
I'd be living with you?

913
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:13,269
Cut the baloney, Maureen. Please.

914
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:15,711
I know you have money.

915
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:18,712
I know you sew it into your pantyhose.

916
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:20,836
I know you've got it under your mattress

917
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:24,435
and shoved up inside every shoe
in your closet.

918
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:26,953
Pay the man.

919
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:32,510
Why can't my family
just love me for my soul

920
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:36,756
instead of my meager possessions
and my bank account?

921
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:40,070
Well, I love your soul, Grandma.

922
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:56,395
Okay, will you take a check,
or do you want the green stuff?

923
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:00,919
I'm free!

924
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:04,759
I'm free!

925
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:11,112
Look at the sky.
Can you see how blue the sky is?

926
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:14,353
This entire experience
has transformed me.

927
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:17,394
I am a new man. The old Walter is dead.

928
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:20,597
But the new Walter wants to say
how much I love you guys.

929
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:23,240
I'm a new man, and we're a new family.

930
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:25,994
I mean, look, we have our problems.
What family doesn't?

931
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:29,629
I know I get to be bull-headed,
and, you know, Ryden here is

932
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:31,790
- essentially unemployable...
- Hmm?

933
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:36,919
...and Hunter licks people, and Grandma's

934
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:40,512
very, very, very

935
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:42,670
kind. So kind.

936
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:46,199
But no matter what, we're a family.

937
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:47,998
We're a real family.

938
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:50,391
We're the Malbys, damn it.

939
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:54,428
From now on, it's Malby time.

940
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:57,791
Malby! Malby!

941
00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:00,110
- Malby! Malby!
- Malby!

942
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:05,558
Malby! Malby! Malby! Malby!

943
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:12,599
Malby! Malby! Malby! Malby!

944
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:21,394
That's all right, honey,
I'll just take a cab over to the curb.

945
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:23,478
- Grab my purse! My purse!
- Did you leave it

946
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:25,232
- at the police station, Maureen?
- No, I didn't.

947
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:28,556
- I thought you had it.
- I don't have your purse.

948
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:31,632
- Adam?
- I'm looking for Ryden Malby.

949
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:32,909
That's me.

950
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,912
This is Barbara Snaff
from Happerman & Browning.

951
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,675
Listen, the position you interviewed for
just came available again.

952
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:43,116
You wanna fire me? Fine! I don't care!
I'm gonna own this town,

953
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:45,395
and I'm gonna come back
and I'm gonna take you down.

954
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:48,119
Wait, wait, are you serious?
You're offering me the job?

955
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:52,193
Yes. Absolutely. When can you start?
The job is yours if you want it.

956
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:54,510
Immediately! Absolutely! Yes!

957
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:57,354
Great, I'll have my assistant call you
with all the details.

958
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:59,715
- Thank you! Perfect!
- She's not there anymore.

959
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:00,915
- Ryden?
- Guys, I got the job!

960
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,797
- Yay!
- I got the job!

961
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:05,872
- Does it pay? Does it pay?
- Yeah, it pays!

962
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:07,473
Malby! Malby!

963
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:09,391
Malby! Malby! Malby!

964
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:10,589
She got a job!

965
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:16,753
Okay.

966
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:23,198
Yo, it's Adam.
You know what to do.

967
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:27,839
Okay. Silent treatment, I get it.

968
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:31,318
Very fifth grade of you, but very effective.

969
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:35,356
Please call me. Please.

970
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:51,352
Yo, it's Adam. You know what to do.

971
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:55,159
All right.

972
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:59,354
Just call me when you're ready.

973
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:23,632
Yeah, yeah, go!
Go, Adam! Take it in!

974
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:25,153
I got him, I got him!

975
01:02:25,720 --> 01:02:27,073
Yes!

976
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:29,315
All right, check ball.

977
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:45,194
Someone once told me
that every evil, horrible thing in the world

978
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:49,671
can be directly counteracted
by the joy of a simple dessert.

979
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:52,991
I'm really sorry, Adam.
I know you don't wanna talk to me,

980
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:56,117
but I really have something to tell you.
I wish you...

981
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:57,758
Hold on a second.

982
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:02,833
If you don't forgive me,
I will follow you everywhere you go,

983
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:07,152
playing this extremely annoying song
till you slowly go insane.

984
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:12,437
Okay, just make it stop.

985
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:20,592
How the hell do you steal
an ice-cream truck?

986
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:24,116
Borrow. My dad knows a guy
that knows a guy, so...

987
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:25,553
Of course.

988
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:34,873
I'm good.

989
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,355
I'm so sorry I flaked on you, Adam.

990
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:43,159
You would never do
anything like that to me.

991
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:45,674
- And I've been thinking a lot about...
- I accept your apology.

992
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:47,591
Wait, you have to let me get this out.

993
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:52,390
I've been thinking a lot about
what you said, and I think you just...

994
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:55,870
- Maybe you just threw me, because...
- Look, it's fine.

995
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:58,558
Really, it's...

996
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:00,915
It's all good. I'm just...

997
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:04,108
You know, I'm in the middle of a game.

998
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:05,872
- Yo.
- Well, wait.

999
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:08,793
Do you wanna, I don't know,
hang out later? Um...

1000
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:11,155
Oh! We could celebrate,
'cause I didn't get a chance to tell you,

1001
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:13,993
but I got that job
at Happerman & Browning.

1002
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:18,514
That's awesome. I...

1003
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:22,593
But I can't get together later,
'cause I kind of need to pack.

1004
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:24,589
Pack?

1005
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:28,033
Yeah.

1006
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:33,671
Look, I didn't get a chance to tell you,
but I decided to go to Columbia.

1007
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:37,671
And I'm leaving tomorrow.

1008
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:39,315
What?

1009
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:42,957
You're going to law school? In New York?

1010
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:44,753
Yeah.

1011
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:48,273
That's...

1012
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:51,957
That's so great. Congratulations.

1013
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:55,077
Yeah, I think it'll be... I think it'll be good.

1014
01:04:57,200 --> 01:05:01,113
Look, I promise I'll call you
as soon as I get settled in, okay?

1015
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:03,758
- Okay.
- Let's go!

1016
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:05,512
Come on, Adam!
Ball in! Ball in! Ball in!

1017
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:06,715
Okay, hold up!

1018
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:07,789
Yeah.

1019
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:17,078
- Our ball.
- Check it up. Check it up, Adam.

1020
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:18,839
Our ball.

1021
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:23,673
All right.

1022
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:32,794
Okay.

1023
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:03,912
Hi, I'm Ryden Malby. I'm...

1024
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,151
The new assistant to the editor. Yes.
One sec, I'll get Lloyd.

1025
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:09,435
I've got Ryden. Thanks.

1026
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:12,396
Well, here it is, home, sweet home.

1027
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:14,835
- That's the mail cart.
- Great. Well, perfect.

1028
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:17,275
Is there any material you want me
to start to read, or...

1029
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:19,157
No. Reading's on your own time.

1030
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:22,676
Jessica was a shit filer, so we're
a little backed up on submissions.

1031
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:24,159
I see that.

1032
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:26,756
What happened to Jessica, anyway?

1033
01:06:26,840 --> 01:06:29,912
Well, we had a little bit
of a misunderstanding, she and I.

1034
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,150
You see,
I thought that she worked for me,

1035
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:34,071
she thought
she was running the company.

1036
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:36,799
- Sounds like Jessica.
- Mmm-hmm. Ready to go?

1037
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:38,950
- Yep, I'll get right on it.
- You know you're gonna have to enter

1038
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:40,598
every one of these
into the database, right?

1039
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:42,557
Okay, absolutely. Yeah.

1040
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:51,796
- Hi.
- Oh!

1041
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:53,233
Of course.

1042
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:56,072
A picture paints a thousand words

1043
01:06:56,160 --> 01:07:00,073
As one door closes
another door opens

1044
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:02,993
And two wrongs don't make a right

1045
01:07:03,080 --> 01:07:05,036
Now good things come to those who wait

1046
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:07,190
Okay, I've got it right here.

1047
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:09,589
My life is a shitstorm.
I got way too much crap

1048
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:11,238
to keep in my own brain.
So what do I do?

1049
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:25,357
No, I think those two books
are totally different.

1050
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:26,789
Different enough.

1051
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:46,758
When are you
gonna build my boxcar?

1052
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:49,035
Get the puppet out of my face.

1053
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:54,036
Come on. All the other kids' dads
are practically done.

1054
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:58,397
Fine, forget it.

1055
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:05,430
Hunter. Wait a minute.

1056
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:18,998
When's that race again?

1057
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:21,036
- Saturday.
- Saturday.

1058
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:23,873
Saturday.

1059
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:29,908
Go get your mother, your grandmother.

1060
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:32,998
We need every able-bodied man
we can get. Go.

1061
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:38,711
Just move all my Thursday appointments
to Friday.

1062
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:40,233
- Okay.
- And you're gonna wanna get

1063
01:08:40,320 --> 01:08:41,435
some beauty sleep this weekend,

1064
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:44,114
'cause I want you to sit in on
the Asia conference on Monday morning.

1065
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:45,235
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

1066
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:48,153
- Oh, great. I'd love to, that'd be great.
- Great.

1067
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:50,879
You forgot one. Sign and date. There.

1068
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:53,839
- All right. Buenos nachos.
- Good night.

1069
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:56,156
Hey, try to get out of here
by 9:00 tonight, will you?

1070
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:57,468
Okay.

1071
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:02,277
Far far, there's this little girl

1072
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:06,353
She was praying for something
to happen to her

1073
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:12,394
The reality looks far now
but don't go

1074
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:16,516
How can you stay outside?

1075
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:20,317
There's a beautiful mess inside

1076
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:24,075
How can you stay outside?

1077
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:28,354
There's a beautiful mess inside

1078
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:33,229
I got this job. This incredible job.

1079
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:36,356
And I'm working my ass off.

1080
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:40,070
But I always expected that.

1081
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:43,510
What are all the boxes for?

1082
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:45,551
Moving back to Brazil.

1083
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:47,679
Are you serious?

1084
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:49,671
Yeah. My life is there.

1085
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:52,233
I haven't seen my family in ages.

1086
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:55,073
And I come home every night to what?

1087
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:01,198
I guess I finally realized
that what you do with your life is

1088
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:03,840
really just one half of the equation.

1089
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:08,115
The other half, the more important half,
really, is

1090
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:11,312
who you're with when you're doing it.

1091
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:39,872
Okay, come on! Come on, come on.
You got plenty of room! You got miles!

1092
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:48,349
Don't tell me that's another cat.

1093
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:54,549
Oh, jeez.

1094
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:56,915
Hey, keep this on the down low, Mom.

1095
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,070
It's one of those goofy gnomes.
Don't tell Carmella.

1096
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:01,469
- Hunty? Come on, Hunty.
- He broke the gnome.

1097
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:05,911
- Jesus! What did I just say?
- Oh, sugar.

1098
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,433
Hand me a...

1099
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:09,432
What's going on?

1100
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:13,674
Get dressed. We're late.
We need all the manpower we can get.

1101
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:16,238
But what if I don't drive good?

1102
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:17,355
Hey!

1103
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:22,592
You're a Malby.
Driving is in your blood. Okay?

1104
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:25,998
Come on. Come on, let's go.
We gotta go. Come on!

1105
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:28,116
And it's "drive well," honey,
not "drive good."

1106
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:30,475
- Wait, don't drive good?
- Proper English is "drive well."

1107
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:31,879
I want you to drive well.

1108
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:34,710
Ladies and gentlemen,
please turn your attention

1109
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:38,031
to the starting ramp
for the last event of the day.

1110
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:40,429
This is the one you've been waiting for.

1111
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:45,389
The final race
for the ninth annual PTA Boxcar Derby.

1112
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:48,951
Racers and their teams,
please take your mark.

1113
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:54,438
Let's go, Raymond!

1114
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:09,312
All right. How you feeling?

1115
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:12,039
- Oh, Maureen, look at Hunter.
- Go, Hunty!

1116
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:13,951
Hi, honey, good luck!

1117
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:16,353
Are you focused?

1118
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:18,749
Balls to the wall.
Don't tell your mom I said that.

1119
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:21,991
- Smoke them. Go get them.
- Balls to the wall, Hunty!

1120
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:25,509
All right, let's go.

1121
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:32,753
- Dad! Dad!
- Brake! Pull the brake back!

1122
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:34,910
- Dad!
- The brake!

1123
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,036
Go, Hunter, go! Go! Go!

1124
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:41,956
Yeah! Go get them!

1125
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:43,393
Go!

1126
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:47,357
- Go! Go! Go!
- Walt, watch your ankle!

1127
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:54,754
Here is to you honey

1128
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:57,957
But I'm out of your league

1129
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:00,679
Never gonna pass me

1130
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:03,318
Go! Get in there!

1131
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:06,799
Lookie here baby

1132
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:09,519
You're coming my way

1133
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:12,512
But I move like a landslide

1134
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:15,990
So get out of my way and stay away

1135
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:18,356
Up from the floor on the count of ten

1136
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:21,432
Oh, you get up,
you get down and you try it again

1137
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:24,235
Up and down and around again

1138
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:27,198
Oh, you get up you get down
and you try it again

1139
01:13:27,720 --> 01:13:30,234
Up and down and around again

1140
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:33,118
Oh, you get up you get down
and you try it again

1141
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:35,998
Oh, you get up you get down
and you try it again

1142
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:39,152
Oh, you get up you get down
and you try it again

1143
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:42,514
Yes!

1144
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:56,475
Whoa!

1145
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:58,755
- Oh, my! Let's go!
- Excuse me!

1146
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:01,669
Dad! Dad!

1147
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:27,874
Thank goodness. You okay?

1148
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:32,438
By the way, you won!

1149
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:37,839
Wow! Look at that!

1150
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:39,478
- Attaboy.
- Come on, up, up!

1151
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:41,073
- That's okay.
- No?

1152
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:42,434
- Not today.
- Okay.

1153
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:43,794
Attaboy.

1154
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:45,359
- Let me see.
- That's so cool.

1155
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:46,429
Look at that.

1156
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:54,353
You all right?

1157
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:27,119
Mom, Dad...

1158
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:42,357
Sure you don't wanna get a little shut-eye

1159
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:45,238
- and see how you feel in the morning?
- Nope.

1160
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:53,792
Just out of curiosity, though, do you
think I'm making the right decision?

1161
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:02,794
You know, ever since you were a little kid,

1162
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:04,552
you always seemed to have it figured out.

1163
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:08,997
You know, you made good grades,
you kept your room neat and clean,

1164
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:11,071
you ate your vegetables.

1165
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:15,956
Can I be honest with you?
I always found it a little troubling.

1166
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:19,628
Because... See, hon,

1167
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:25,074
the world's a screwy place.
It doesn't play by the rules.

1168
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:29,196
So, if you're asking me,

1169
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:34,039
do I think it's a good idea for you
to quit your job,

1170
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:39,229
leave behind the only family you have,
and travel 3,000 miles

1171
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:42,628
to a place you've never been before,

1172
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:48,351
I think it's the most kick-ass idea
you've ever had.

1173
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:54,918
'Cause I think no matter where you are,
you're gonna knock 'em dead.

1174
01:16:57,240 --> 01:16:58,798
Thanks, Dad.

1175
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:07,952
- See you. Love you, honey.
- Okay. Love you. Bye.

1176
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:11,032
- No goodbyes. Just see you later.
- You be careful in New York.

1177
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:12,712
They're a bunch of kookies there,
you know.

1178
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:14,756
- Okay, I will.
- Call me frequently, okay?

1179
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:16,876
- Okay.
- I've got you on my speed dial

1180
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:18,075
- and you're on-line.
- Okay.

1181
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:19,798
- Okay?
- Okay, bye.

1182
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:22,634
Bye!

1183
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:27,159
Beautifully bold
when the colors unfold

1184
01:17:27,240 --> 01:17:32,155
Yes, it's easy to see but it's harder to find

1185
01:17:32,240 --> 01:17:37,394
And I'm thinking of you
and it's clear in my mind

1186
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:41,837
So I turn, turn, turn

1187
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:48,519
I turn back around

1188
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:52,508
I turn, turn, turn

1189
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:57,230
I turn back around

1190
01:17:57,320 --> 01:18:01,154
And I'm eastern bound

1191
01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:07,354
Thanks.

1192
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:14,791
Almost let slip
all these words at my fingertips

1193
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:19,319
Still unaware of the pen in my hand

1194
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:25,270
But I'm making my way
day by day coming back to you

1195
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:29,759
Here unafraid of the path that I choose

1196
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:34,356
So I turn, turn, turn

1197
01:18:34,440 --> 01:18:39,150
I turn back around

1198
01:18:39,240 --> 01:18:42,198
And you are found

1199
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:50,554
Hey.

1200
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:53,112
Life sucks without you.

1201
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:54,599
I miss you. I...

1202
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:59,310
Well, of course I miss you.
I knew that I would, but it's not like a,

1203
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:04,199
"Hey, we had some great times,"
you know, "keep in touch" kind of thing.

1204
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:08,034
It was more like, "I can't eat, I can't sleep,

1205
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:11,430
"I forget what it feels like to laugh"
kind of thing.

1206
01:19:12,360 --> 01:19:14,999
And I really think that when you left,

1207
01:19:16,440 --> 01:19:18,510
you took my heart with you.

1208
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:29,069
Um...

1209
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,797
I probably should've called first.

1210
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:34,950
Oh, whoa. Whoa. No, no, no. Hold...

1211
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:37,235
Ryden! Whoa! Where are you...

1212
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:39,710
Where are you going? Ryden!

1213
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:48,755
Ryden! Ryden, hey! Wait, hold up.

1214
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:51,229
Look, hey, stop. All right? Hey.

1215
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:54,919
She's my RA.

1216
01:19:56,920 --> 01:19:59,753
I was just filling out
a maintenance report.

1217
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:02,152
- She's not...
- No.

1218
01:20:02,920 --> 01:20:04,672
- Really?
- Yeah.

1219
01:20:23,560 --> 01:20:25,118
I love you.

1220
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:29,598
Well, that's good. 'Cause I love you.

1221
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:33,640
Some kind of magic

1222
01:20:36,240 --> 01:20:38,754
Happens late at night

1223
01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:41,596
- Wanna go inside?
- Yeah.

1224
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:45,434
When the moon smiles down at me

1225
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:50,114
Hey, Walt, it's Ryden.

1226
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:52,271
- Hey, sweetie pie!
- It's her machine, so leave a message.

1227
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:55,512
Oh! Hey, guess who's coming for a visit?
We got cheap-ass tickets,

1228
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:57,670
on cheapasstickets. Com, swear to God.

1229
01:20:57,760 --> 01:21:00,558
Ask Adam if he's got a pull-out,
'cause Grandma's got that heinous hump,

1230
01:21:00,640 --> 01:21:02,153
and I don't wanna have her suffering

1231
01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:04,390
- any more than she...
- I don't have a hump! Give me that.

1232
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:07,392
I don't have a hump. I can sleep
anyplace you wanna put me, Ryden.

1233
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:09,471
And, honey, it's genetic,
so take your calcium.

1234
01:21:09,560 --> 01:21:11,755
And don't forget to layer up, okay?
You're from California!

1235
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:14,559
And remember,
condoms are your best friend.

1236
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:16,153
Dad smells like feet!

1237
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:19,198
Wait, like, the whole family's coming?

1238
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:22,000
It's a brand new day

1239
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:23,989
The sun is shining

1240
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:27,638
It's a brand new day

1241
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:35,232
For the first time in such a long, long time

1242
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:41,390
I know I'll be ok

1243
01:21:42,640 --> 01:21:44,949
I'm counting the street lights

1244
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:47,156
It's all I can do

1245
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:53,270
While driving myself crazy
trying to get to you

1246
01:21:55,360 --> 01:21:57,954
Feels wrong at the right time

1247
01:21:58,720 --> 01:22:00,915
To reveal my hand

1248
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:04,833
It's like I'm doing the worst I can

1249
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:07,753
To make you understand

1250
01:22:09,560 --> 01:22:12,597
Maybe one day you will know

1251
01:22:15,880 --> 01:22:21,398
How hard it is for me to show my heart

1252
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:25,554
And all the love

1253
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:28,154
Running through my soul

1254
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:33,311
Maybe one day you will know

1255
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:39,313
I'm hoping you just might

1256
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:42,673
Take a moment to realize

1257
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:45,839
That everything you're looking for

1258
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:48,639
Is hidden in plain sight

1259
01:22:50,160 --> 01:22:55,518
I know you better than I know myself

1260
01:22:56,960 --> 01:23:03,149
How I feel is the only thing
I could never, ever tell you

1261
01:23:04,280 --> 01:23:07,511
Maybe one day you will know

1262
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:15,958
How hard it is for me to show my heart

1263
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:19,916
And all the love

1264
01:23:20,240 --> 01:23:22,913
Running through my soul

1265
01:23:24,680 --> 01:23:27,956
Maybe one day you will know

1266
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:34,632
Maybe one day you will know

1267
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:40,794
Maybe one day you will know

1268
01:24:54,640 --> 01:24:55,629
Ive met carrot on subscene.
