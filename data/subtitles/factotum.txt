1
00:01:00,369 --> 00:01:02,526
Mr. Chinaski!

2
00:01:02,745 --> 00:01:05,780
Get over here!

3
00:01:07,664 --> 00:01:10,285
- You've got a drivers license?
- Yes.

4
00:01:10,499 --> 00:01:15,918
One driver's sick. We've got some rush
orders. You need to make the deliveries.

5
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:41,173
Hi, Chi...!

6
00:03:14,817 --> 00:03:18,101
Feeling bad?

7
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,817
I've felt better.

8
00:03:22,029 --> 00:03:27,697
I've probably slept longer
than you've lived.

9
00:03:51,671 --> 00:03:55,085
Chinaski, you're fired.

10
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:41,224
Do you have a room?

11
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:44,853
- It's $150 a week.
- All right.

12
00:05:45,066 --> 00:05:49,726
- Are you employed?
- Self employed.

13
00:05:49,943 --> 00:05:54,568
- May I ask what you do?
- I'm a writer.

14
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:58,691
Have you written books?

15
00:05:58,907 --> 00:06:02,440
I'm not ready for a novel... yet.

16
00:06:04,451 --> 00:06:06,988
OK.

17
00:07:08,278 --> 00:07:13,815
Most guys think they know how to drive.
But in fact very few know how.

18
00:07:14,031 --> 00:07:16,319
They just steer.

19
00:07:16,532 --> 00:07:21,690
Every day I see 2-3 people run through
red lights like they didn't exist.

20
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:27,613
The lives people live drive them crazy,
and it comes out in the way they drive.

21
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:33,498
I'm not here to tell you how to live.
I'm here to teach you how to drive.

22
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:37,621
When can a man
lose control over his cab?

23
00:07:37,836 --> 00:07:40,871
When I get a hard on?

24
00:07:41,087 --> 00:07:44,537
If you can't drive with a hard on
we can't use you.

25
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:49,084
Some of our best men
drive with a hard on all day long.

26
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:53,510
When can one lose control
and not be able to help it?

27
00:07:53,719 --> 00:07:55,925
Chinaski?

28
00:07:56,137 --> 00:08:02,339
A man might lose control
over his cab when he sneezed.

29
00:08:02,558 --> 00:08:05,343
Correct.

30
00:08:05,559 --> 00:08:08,927
When you sneeze what do you do?

31
00:08:16,232 --> 00:08:18,900
- Are you Henry Chinaski?
- Yes, sir.

32
00:08:19,108 --> 00:08:22,061
Follow me.

33
00:08:24,903 --> 00:08:27,689
Sit down.

34
00:08:30,406 --> 00:08:34,449
We ran a check on you.

35
00:08:34,658 --> 00:08:41,275
You have 18 drunk and disorderly
arrests. And one for drunk driving.

36
00:08:41,495 --> 00:08:47,780
- There were two for drunk driving.
- You lied to us. You're disqualified.

37
00:09:02,298 --> 00:09:05,748
Could you call me a cab?

38
00:10:02,456 --> 00:10:07,994
As we live we all get caught
and by various traps.

39
00:10:08,209 --> 00:10:11,162
Writing can trap you.

40
00:10:11,378 --> 00:10:16,203
Some tend to write what has pleased
their readers in the past.

41
00:10:16,422 --> 00:10:19,955
They hear accolades and believe them.

42
00:10:20,174 --> 00:10:25,628
There is only one final judge
of writing and that is the writer.

43
00:10:25,844 --> 00:10:33,338
When he is swayed by the critics, the
editors, the readers, he is finished.

44
00:10:33,557 --> 00:10:37,553
And when he's
swayed with his fame -

45
00:10:37,767 --> 00:10:41,929
- you can float him
down the river with the turds.

46
00:10:43,187 --> 00:10:45,855
- A writer?
- Yes.

47
00:10:46,063 --> 00:10:49,645
- Are you sure?
- No.

48
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:53,192
Why do you want to work
in a pickle factory?

49
00:10:53,192 --> 00:10:58,185
- It reminds me of my grandmother.
- It does?

50
00:10:58,404 --> 00:11:04,688
She used to serve me pickles
whenever I visited her.

51
00:11:04,907 --> 00:11:10,361
- What do you write?
- Mostly short stories.

52
00:11:10,577 --> 00:11:15,071
- I'm half way through a novel.
- What's it about?

53
00:11:15,288 --> 00:11:20,244
- Everything.
- It's for instance about cancer?

54
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:24,912
Yes.

55
00:11:25,126 --> 00:11:28,494
How about my wife?

56
00:11:28,712 --> 00:11:33,039
She's in there too.

57
00:11:54,851 --> 00:11:57,519
I wrote 3-4 short stories a week.

58
00:11:57,728 --> 00:12:03,680
I imagined how the editors in
The New Yorker must be reacting.

59
00:12:03,898 --> 00:12:07,976
Hey, here's another one from that nut!

60
00:12:09,651 --> 00:12:15,521
I sent most of them to John Martin.
I admired his magazine, Black Sparrow.

61
00:12:46,087 --> 00:12:50,379
Chinaski?
You want to step in here for a minute?

62
00:12:59,428 --> 00:13:02,344
Mr. Gentry is a writer too.

63
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:11,758
I told him that you were a writer and
he wanted to meet you. Do you mind?

64
00:13:11,976 --> 00:13:15,675
I don't mind.

65
00:13:18,563 --> 00:13:22,061
Mr. Gentry is a friend of mine.

66
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:55,498
Do you mind if I leave?

67
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:58,910
OK.

68
00:14:18,638 --> 00:14:25,765
The scene in the office stayed with
me. Those cigars the fine clothes...

69
00:14:25,975 --> 00:14:28,216
I thought of good stakes.

70
00:14:28,435 --> 00:14:33,853
Long rides up winding driveways
that led to beautiful homes.

71
00:14:34,063 --> 00:14:37,845
Ease. Trips to Europe.

72
00:14:38,065 --> 00:14:41,433
Fine women.

73
00:14:48,196 --> 00:14:52,405
Chinaski, what are you doing?
Get back to work, your shift's not over.

74
00:14:52,615 --> 00:14:57,191
- I need a drink.
- No, no. Get back to work.

75
00:14:57,409 --> 00:14:59,365
Over here.

76
00:15:04,371 --> 00:15:06,695
Get off me!

77
00:15:11,834 --> 00:15:14,454
No!

78
00:15:19,046 --> 00:15:22,709
- You OK?
- I'm fine.

79
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:25,495
I don't need this!

80
00:15:36,764 --> 00:15:40,890
Then I met Jan.

81
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:45,973
I bought her a drink and
she gave me her phone number.

82
00:15:46,186 --> 00:15:50,513
Three days later
I moved into her apartment.

83
00:16:09,824 --> 00:16:13,950
Jan had a 500-dollar car.

84
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:18,025
The big trick was
how to turn on the headlights.

85
00:16:18,245 --> 00:16:22,821
Of course we had
the advantage of broken springs.

86
00:16:50,763 --> 00:16:53,798
Jan was an excellent fuck.

87
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:59,516
She had a tight pussy. And she took
it like it was a knife killing her.

88
00:16:59,726 --> 00:17:02,725
I want to know what time it is!

89
00:17:02,936 --> 00:17:06,185
You said you'd fix the clock.

90
00:17:06,396 --> 00:17:22,530
All right, let's see...

91
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:27,403
We set the clock
by the TV at midnight last night.

92
00:17:27,616 --> 00:17:32,406
We know that it gains
35 minutes every hour.

93
00:17:32,619 --> 00:17:38,121
It says 7:30 p.m. But that's not
right because it's not dark yet.

94
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,708
That's 71/2 hours.

95
00:17:43,917 --> 00:17:47,366
Seven times 35 minutes...

96
00:17:47,585 --> 00:17:52,624
That's 245 minutes.

97
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:57,297
One half of 35 is...

98
00:17:57,507 --> 00:18:01,835
171/2.

99
00:18:02,051 --> 00:18:04,209
It gives us...

100
00:18:04,428 --> 00:18:10,131
2521/2 minutes.

101
00:18:10,348 --> 00:18:17,142
That's four hours and
421/2 minutes we owe them.

102
00:18:17,352 --> 00:18:22,058
So we set the clock back to 5:47.
That's it.

103
00:18:22,271 --> 00:18:25,721
It's 5:47.

104
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:30,516
It's dinner time
and we don't have anything to eat.

105
00:18:32,902 --> 00:18:37,478
Let's open another jug of wine.
Should I make some pancakes?

106
00:18:37,696 --> 00:18:42,107
I don't know if I can get
another one of them down.

107
00:18:42,323 --> 00:18:46,154
Okay, put the pancakes on.

108
00:18:49,411 --> 00:18:52,494
We're still out of butter.

109
00:18:52,704 --> 00:18:57,743
- Well, fry them dry again.
- They'll be crisp. Real crisp.

110
00:18:57,957 --> 00:19:01,739
It's okay, baby.

111
00:20:26,255 --> 00:20:29,504
What was that?

112
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:35,169
What is that?

113
00:20:58,856 --> 00:21:02,022
Is anyone in there?

114
00:21:04,943 --> 00:21:07,563
Everybody out!

115
00:21:07,778 --> 00:21:12,189
It's just the fire department.

116
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:37,829
I finally got hired at
a Bicycle Supply Warehouse.

117
00:21:38,044 --> 00:21:41,328
I had to demean myself
to get that one.

118
00:21:41,546 --> 00:21:46,586
I told them that I liked
to think of my job as a second home.

119
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:49,254
You play the horses?

120
00:21:49,467 --> 00:21:52,383
Yeah.

121
00:21:52,594 --> 00:21:56,590
Mind if I look at your paper?

122
00:21:56,805 --> 00:21:59,804
Sure.

123
00:22:08,394 --> 00:22:14,430
- My Boy Bobby ought to take the eight.
- And they don't even have him on top.

124
00:22:14,648 --> 00:22:17,564
- All the better.
- What do you think he'll pay?

125
00:22:17,774 --> 00:22:20,774
About 9 to 2.

126
00:22:24,695 --> 00:22:29,070
- What time does the last race go off?
- 5: 30.

127
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:32,648
- We get off at 5: 00.
- We'd never make it.

128
00:22:32,866 --> 00:22:36,909
We can try.
The racetrack's not too far.

129
00:22:38,494 --> 00:22:41,992
- Want to come along?
- Sure.

130
00:22:42,204 --> 00:22:45,619
We'll cut out at five to five.

131
00:23:00,715 --> 00:23:03,251
See, I told you we'd make it!

132
00:23:16,848 --> 00:23:20,891
$200 on My Boy Bobby to win.

133
00:23:34,358 --> 00:23:38,354
My Boy Bobby's in the front.
He's in the lead!

134
00:23:38,569 --> 00:23:42,066
We've hooked ourselves a winner!

135
00:23:43,154 --> 00:23:46,688
Unless some big-ass closer
comes out of the back of the pack.

136
00:23:46,906 --> 00:23:49,313
Come on, Bobby!

137
00:23:49,533 --> 00:23:54,987
- Yes!
- We should have bet another $200.

138
00:23:55,203 --> 00:23:58,866
Come on, let's go get a drink.

139
00:24:05,875 --> 00:24:11,911
The next day some of the others
asked if we would place bets for them.

140
00:24:12,129 --> 00:24:16,456
Hank, we have to take their bets.

141
00:24:16,673 --> 00:24:19,756
Manny, those guys
haven't got any money.

142
00:24:19,966 --> 00:24:23,914
Only the coffee and chewing gum money
that their wives give them.

143
00:24:24,135 --> 00:24:27,882
We can't waste time
at the 2-dollar windows.

144
00:24:28,096 --> 00:24:32,755
We're not going to bet their money,
we're going to keep their money.

145
00:24:32,973 --> 00:24:36,257
- Suppose they win?
- They won't.

146
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:41,633
They have a way of
always picking the wrong horse.

147
00:24:43,104 --> 00:24:46,602
Suppose they bet our horse?

148
00:24:46,814 --> 00:24:50,098
Then we know
we've got the wrong horse.

149
00:24:54,985 --> 00:24:58,400
I think she's going to do it.

150
00:24:58,612 --> 00:25:01,980
Go, Spitfire!

151
00:25:02,198 --> 00:25:05,150
Yes! Way to go!

152
00:25:36,466 --> 00:25:40,332
- You married, Manny?
- No way.

153
00:25:40,552 --> 00:25:42,544
- Women?
- Sometimes.

154
00:25:42,761 --> 00:25:46,544
- But it never lasts.
- What's the problem?

155
00:25:46,764 --> 00:25:51,139
A woman is like a full-time job.

156
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:55,843
- I suppose there is an emotional drain.
- Physical too.

157
00:25:56,060 --> 00:26:00,056
They want to fuck night and day.

158
00:26:00,271 --> 00:26:04,598
Well. Get one you like to fuck.

159
00:26:04,815 --> 00:26:09,771
Yes, but if you drink or gamble they
think it's a put down of their love.

160
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:13,317
Get one who
likes to drink, gamble and fuck.

161
00:26:13,528 --> 00:26:17,476
Who wants a woman like that?

162
00:26:21,407 --> 00:26:25,106
I bought some expensive clothes
and shoes.

163
00:26:25,326 --> 00:26:30,152
The owner of the Warehouse
didn't look so powerful anymore.

164
00:26:30,371 --> 00:26:33,785
Manny and I took
a little longer with our lunches -

165
00:26:33,998 --> 00:26:40,329
- and came back smoking cigars.
The new life didn't sit well with Jan.

166
00:26:40,543 --> 00:26:46,495
She was used to her four fucks a day
and seeing me poor and humble.

167
00:26:57,677 --> 00:27:01,294
Mr. Horseplayer!

168
00:27:01,513 --> 00:27:04,848
Mr. Big Horseplayer!

169
00:27:04,848 --> 00:27:08,891
I used to like the way
you walked across the room.

170
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:15,385
Like you were walking through walls.
Like nothing mattered.

171
00:27:15,604 --> 00:27:20,310
Now you've got a few bucks in your
pocket, you're not the same anymore.

172
00:27:20,523 --> 00:27:23,688
You act like you're
a dental student or a plumber.

173
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:27,267
Don't give me any shit about plumbers.

174
00:27:29,278 --> 00:27:34,566
- We haven't made love in two weeks.
- Love takes many forms.

175
00:27:34,781 --> 00:27:38,444
You haven't fucked me in two weeks.

176
00:27:38,658 --> 00:27:43,781
Have some patience. In six months
we'll be vacationing in Rome, in Paris.

177
00:27:43,994 --> 00:27:49,828
Look at you! Pouring yourself that good
whiskey and letting me drink this crap.

178
00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:54,782
- Mr. Big-Time Horseplayer!
- I give you soul.

179
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,826
I give you wisdom and light
and music and some laughter!

180
00:28:00,045 --> 00:28:03,910
By the way,
I am the world's greatest horseplayer.

181
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:06,252
Horseshit!

182
00:28:06,465 --> 00:28:10,046
No, horseplayer!

183
00:28:13,677 --> 00:28:18,917
I understood too well that great
lovers were always men of leisure.

184
00:28:19,138 --> 00:28:24,012
I fucked better as a bum
than as a puncher of time clocks.

185
00:28:35,189 --> 00:28:38,687
- I've always wanted to go there.
- It's quite nice, actually.

186
00:28:40,192 --> 00:28:45,610
I tried to make a woman out of you,
but you're nothing but a whore!

187
00:28:53,157 --> 00:28:58,493
If anybody here doesn't like
what I just did, then say something!

188
00:29:15,461 --> 00:29:20,963
Sit down, Chinaski.
You knew we were going to let you go.

189
00:29:21,172 --> 00:29:26,508
- Bosses are never hard to fathom.
- You've been slacking for over a month.

190
00:29:26,717 --> 00:29:32,136
- I've been busting my ass!
- No you haven't!

191
00:29:32,345 --> 00:29:35,795
I've given you my time.

192
00:29:36,014 --> 00:29:40,092
For pitiful $6 an hour.

193
00:29:40,308 --> 00:29:44,304
Remember, you begged for this job.

194
00:29:44,518 --> 00:29:52,475
I give you my time, so you can live
in your big house. I've been the loser.

195
00:29:52,689 --> 00:29:56,816
- You understand?
- All right, Chinaski. Just go.

196
00:29:57,025 --> 00:30:00,938
Listen, Mantz. I don't want any trouble
about my unemployment payments.

197
00:30:01,152 --> 00:30:06,903
You guys are always trying to cheat
the working man out of his rights.

198
00:30:07,114 --> 00:30:11,738
You'll get your unemployment.
Now get the hell out of here!

199
00:30:15,077 --> 00:30:19,737
I didn't see Manny again, and I missed
the trips to the track with him.

200
00:30:19,954 --> 00:30:24,081
But I had my winnings
and the bookie money.

201
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:27,625
I just sat around and Jan liked that.

202
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:31,455
After two weeks
I was on unemployment.

203
00:30:31,669 --> 00:30:34,918
We relaxed and fucked
and toured the bars.

204
00:30:35,129 --> 00:30:40,548
Every week I'd go down,
stand in line and get my check.

205
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:46,374
Hank?

206
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:50,044
I love you.

207
00:31:18,736 --> 00:31:23,313
Here's a ten-dollar try
on the four with one and two.

208
00:31:26,991 --> 00:31:31,201
The racetrack crowd
is the world brought down to size.

209
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:34,493
Life grinding against
death and losing.

210
00:31:34,703 --> 00:31:39,245
Nobody wins finally,
we're only seeking a reprieve.

211
00:31:39,456 --> 00:31:42,539
A moment out of the glare.

212
00:31:44,584 --> 00:31:50,584
- Sir, you're in our seats.
- There are no reserved seats here.

213
00:31:50,796 --> 00:31:55,586
I know. But it's a common courtesy.

214
00:31:55,798 --> 00:31:59,664
Some people get her early.

215
00:31:59,884 --> 00:32:04,093
Poor people, like you and me,
who can't afford reserved seats.

216
00:32:04,303 --> 00:32:08,251
They lay down newspapers
to indicate that these seats are saved.

217
00:32:08,472 --> 00:32:14,140
If the poor aren't decent with one
another nobody else is going to be.

218
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:16,887
I am not poor.

219
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:21,643
If you can't be a gentleman,
at least don't be a hog.

220
00:32:21,854 --> 00:32:24,854
Jan, sit down.

221
00:32:25,064 --> 00:32:28,064
I'll stand.

222
00:32:36,154 --> 00:32:39,355
Come on four.

223
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:50,194
Let's get a drink.

224
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:24,006
That man in our seats, he's got nerve.

225
00:33:24,222 --> 00:33:27,968
- I don't like the guy.
- He sure got your goat.

226
00:33:28,182 --> 00:33:31,632
He was just a little guy.

227
00:33:31,851 --> 00:33:36,641
If he'd been big
you wouldn't have done anything either.

228
00:33:54,446 --> 00:33:56,319
What do you do for a living?

229
00:33:56,531 --> 00:34:02,483
Real estate.
I make 500000 a year.

230
00:34:02,701 --> 00:34:06,744
Then why don't you
get yourself a reserved seat?

231
00:34:06,953 --> 00:34:09,953
That's my prerogative.

232
00:34:10,163 --> 00:34:13,495
You know, you have
the nicest blue eyes.

233
00:34:13,707 --> 00:34:16,790
You got a cigarette?

234
00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:29,298
- Pardon me, but you are in my seat.
- And what are you going to do about it?

235
00:34:51,811 --> 00:34:54,597
Pardon me.

236
00:34:54,813 --> 00:34:57,682
Come on, baby.

237
00:37:26,562 --> 00:37:29,099
How do you feel?

238
00:37:29,314 --> 00:37:32,397
I feel bad.

239
00:37:33,566 --> 00:37:36,649
I want to be alone.

240
00:37:38,694 --> 00:37:43,235
You don't have enough love.
It's warped you.

241
00:37:44,739 --> 00:37:51,983
People don't need love. They need
success of some form or another.

242
00:37:53,744 --> 00:37:57,953
It can be love
but it doesn't have to be.

243
00:38:00,497 --> 00:38:05,959
The Bible says: 'Love thy neighbor.'

244
00:38:05,959 --> 00:38:10,085
That could also mean:
Leave him alone.

245
00:38:47,481 --> 00:38:50,351
One half is yours.

246
00:38:51,775 --> 00:38:55,641
- It's another woman, isn't it?
- No.

247
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:02,694
- You don't love me anymore.
- Stop that shit, would you?

248
00:39:04,783 --> 00:39:08,778
You're tired of fucking me.

249
00:39:13,454 --> 00:39:17,284
Hank, stay with me.

250
00:39:36,175 --> 00:39:38,878
Here, take it.

251
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:55,219
You'll manage.

252
00:40:03,648 --> 00:40:06,564
Hank...

253
00:40:41,127 --> 00:40:46,878
Even at my lowest times I can feel
the words bubbling inside of me.

254
00:40:47,088 --> 00:40:48,961
I had to get them down -

255
00:40:49,173 --> 00:40:53,169
- or be overcome
by something worse than death.

256
00:40:53,383 --> 00:40:59,051
Words, not as precious things
but as necessary things.

257
00:40:59,262 --> 00:41:03,388
Yet, when I begin to doubt
my ability to work the word -

258
00:41:03,597 --> 00:41:09,715
- I simply read another writer and
I know I have nothing to worry about.

259
00:41:11,518 --> 00:41:15,680
My contest is only with myself,
to do it right.

260
00:41:15,896 --> 00:41:18,516
With power and force.

261
00:41:18,731 --> 00:41:56,585
And delight and gamble.

262
00:41:56,585 --> 00:41:59,454
I'll have a scotch, please.

263
00:42:24,433 --> 00:42:27,635
Bartender, I'll have another one.

264
00:42:29,519 --> 00:42:34,060
And get the little lady
whatever she's having.

265
00:42:46,278 --> 00:42:50,488
That drink was my last. I'm broke.

266
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:57,784
Are you serious?

267
00:42:59,744 --> 00:43:04,487
- Do you have a place to stay?
- No.

268
00:43:04,705 --> 00:43:09,495
And you haven't got any money,
or anything to drink?

269
00:43:11,292 --> 00:43:13,747
No.

270
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:20,043
Two Evan Williams, a six-pack of beer,
two packs of cigarettes, -

271
00:43:20,255 --> 00:43:25,378
- some chips,
some mixed nuts, some alka-seltzer, -

272
00:43:25,592 --> 00:43:29,255
- and a good cigar.

273
00:43:29,469 --> 00:43:33,465
- Cash or credit card?
- Charge it to Pierre.

274
00:43:33,679 --> 00:43:36,714
I'll have to phone.

275
00:43:36,931 --> 00:43:41,342
- Where are we going?
- My place.

276
00:43:47,103 --> 00:43:50,186
- It's okay.
- Thank you.

277
00:44:22,248 --> 00:44:26,196
- Do you like this kind of music?
- Yes.

278
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:32,829
Swell.

279
00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:40,747
What?

280
00:44:40,966 --> 00:44:45,176
You think your great.

281
00:44:45,385 --> 00:44:48,089
No.

282
00:44:48,303 --> 00:44:51,054
Yes. I can tell by the way you act.

283
00:44:51,263 --> 00:44:54,346
I like you tough.

284
00:44:54,557 --> 00:44:57,556
I liked you right away.

285
00:44:57,767 --> 00:45:01,597
Hike up your skirt.

286
00:45:01,811 --> 00:45:06,103
- You like legs?
- Yes.

287
00:45:08,731 --> 00:45:13,806
You're not some maniac? There's
a guy who's been picking up girls.

288
00:45:14,026 --> 00:45:20,393
Cuts crossword puzzles
into their bodies with a pen knife.

289
00:45:22,239 --> 00:45:27,194
I write, but I'm not him.

290
00:45:32,244 --> 00:45:37,367
Then there are guys who fuck you
and chop you into little pieces.

291
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:41,113
They find your ass in a drainpipe.

292
00:45:41,332 --> 00:45:45,031
And your tit in a trash can downtown.

293
00:45:45,251 --> 00:45:49,745
I stopped doing that, years ago.

294
00:46:38,530 --> 00:46:42,194
Stay back from the door.
He's got a camera.

295
00:46:42,407 --> 00:46:47,482
Let him just see me. When
the buzzer sounds you follow me in.

296
00:46:53,955 --> 00:46:57,903
- Sweetie, so good to see you!
- Pierre, hi!

297
00:47:03,210 --> 00:47:07,880
How are you?

298
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:13,251
- Who's that guy?
- I want you to meet a friend of mine.

299
00:47:13,466 --> 00:47:17,083
Pierre, this is Henry Chinaski.

300
00:47:17,301 --> 00:47:21,214
- Good to know you, Pierre.
- Come on in.

301
00:47:21,429 --> 00:47:26,421
Thank you. You're so good, Pierre.

302
00:47:28,849 --> 00:47:33,509
Hi girls.
This is Henry Chinaski.

303
00:47:33,727 --> 00:47:37,426
Henry, this is Grace and Jerry.

304
00:47:42,649 --> 00:47:51,153
Help yourself.

305
00:47:51,153 --> 00:47:55,564
- So, what do you do?
- He's a writer.

306
00:47:55,781 --> 00:48:00,571
I need somebody to do a libretto
for an opera I wrote.

307
00:48:00,783 --> 00:48:05,111
It's called
The Emperor of San Francisco.

308
00:48:05,328 --> 00:48:11,114
Did you know there was one who claimed
he was the Emperor of San Francisco?

309
00:48:11,331 --> 00:48:16,536
- No, I didn't.
- It's a real story.

310
00:48:16,751 --> 00:48:20,449
You look like you've been around.

311
00:48:20,669 --> 00:48:24,167
You look like you've got class.

312
00:48:28,799 --> 00:48:33,340
Would you like to hear
some music from my opera?

313
00:48:35,719 --> 00:48:41,091
Yes, I'd like that very much,
if it's OK with you?

314
00:48:42,723 --> 00:48:45,557
Great.

315
00:49:44,674 --> 00:49:47,922
He's a tight son of a bitch.

316
00:49:48,134 --> 00:49:53,043
He likes to take care of the girls in
the bars who have no place to sleep.

317
00:49:53,262 --> 00:49:56,510
All he gives them is food and a bed.

318
00:49:56,722 --> 00:49:59,556
Never any money.

319
00:49:59,765 --> 00:50:04,010
And they only have drinks
when he's drinking.

320
00:50:05,518 --> 00:50:08,933
Jerry got to him one night, though.

321
00:50:09,145 --> 00:50:11,516
He was horny.

322
00:50:11,730 --> 00:50:15,062
He was chasing her around the table.

323
00:50:15,274 --> 00:50:17,680
She said 'no'.

324
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:22,275
'Not unless you give me
a thousand bucks a month for life! '

325
00:50:24,779 --> 00:50:28,442
He signed a piece of paper.

326
00:50:28,656 --> 00:50:32,355
That he has to pay her $1000 a month.

327
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:37,649
Even after he dies
his family will have to pay her.

328
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:44,115
Jerry is his main girl, though.

329
00:50:47,333 --> 00:50:50,581
What about you?

330
00:50:52,127 --> 00:50:55,494
Not for a long time.

331
00:50:59,589 --> 00:51:02,791
I like you.

332
00:51:04,967 --> 00:51:08,216
You do?

333
00:51:10,595 --> 00:51:17,010
Watch tomorrow. If he comes out
with that sailor's cap on, -

334
00:51:17,224 --> 00:51:22,927
- that means that
we're going out on his yacht.

335
00:51:23,144 --> 00:51:27,270
Doctors made him get a yacht.

336
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:30,432
Is it a long one?

337
00:51:30,648 --> 00:51:33,434
Sure.

338
00:51:42,905 --> 00:51:45,739
We're going out on the yacht.

339
00:53:19,958 --> 00:53:23,372
- We're going back.
- What for?

340
00:53:23,585 --> 00:53:30,628
Grace is having one of those moments.
She's just staring at the water.

341
00:53:30,839 --> 00:53:34,917
I'm afraid she'll jump off the boat.
She can't swim.

342
00:53:35,133 --> 00:53:39,876
- Just give her 50 bucks!
- No. We're going back.

343
00:53:43,471 --> 00:53:47,716
This happens every time we go out.

344
00:53:49,766 --> 00:53:54,805
Grace goes into one of her moods
and stands there staring at the ocean.

345
00:53:55,019 --> 00:53:58,386
She's never going to jump overboard.

346
00:53:58,604 --> 00:54:01,852
She hates water!

347
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:14,570
Laura and I split up
and I never saw any of them again.

348
00:54:31,622 --> 00:54:34,325
- Hey, mom.
- Is that you?

349
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:36,331
Yeah.

350
00:54:36,541 --> 00:54:40,537
I just need a place to sleep
for a couple of days.

351
00:54:40,752 --> 00:54:44,618
Your bedroom is always waiting.

352
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:48,749
Your father is home.

353
00:54:54,718 --> 00:54:57,670
Thanks, mom.

354
00:54:59,512 --> 00:55:02,428
Hey, dad.

355
00:55:24,943 --> 00:55:27,563
Thanks.

356
00:55:34,656 --> 00:55:37,276
You got a job?

357
00:55:37,491 --> 00:55:39,364
No.

358
00:55:39,576 --> 00:55:43,275
Any man who wants work can find work.

359
00:55:43,494 --> 00:55:47,989
Suppose you're right.

360
00:55:48,205 --> 00:55:51,540
I can hardly believe you're my son.

361
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:55,488
You don't have any ambition.

362
00:55:55,709 --> 00:55:59,456
How the hell are you
going to make it in this world?

363
00:56:07,591 --> 00:56:10,425
Still think you're a writer?

364
00:56:10,634 --> 00:56:12,840
I am still writing.

365
00:56:19,639 --> 00:56:23,552
If you stay here I'll charge you
room and board plus laundry.

366
00:56:23,766 --> 00:56:29,007
When you get a job, what's yours we take
out of your wages till you're paid up.

367
00:56:33,147 --> 00:56:35,185
You're drunk!

368
00:56:35,398 --> 00:56:40,307
- Yes.
- Where do you get the money to drink?

369
00:56:40,526 --> 00:56:43,691
- I'll get a job.
- How?

370
00:56:43,902 --> 00:56:48,646
- You act as if I had murdered somebody.
- It's just as bad!

371
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:56,405
Are you finished?

372
00:56:58,952 --> 00:57:01,620
Thanks for the food, mom.

373
00:57:01,829 --> 00:57:06,453
- You're not hungry?
- No. I'm good, thank you.

374
00:57:28,302 --> 00:57:33,424
Robert, how about you and I
go out and have a few cocktails?

375
00:57:33,638 --> 00:57:38,381
Drinking in the middle of the week
without a job?

376
00:57:38,599 --> 00:57:42,725
That's when you need a drink the most.

377
00:57:42,935 --> 00:57:45,092
I am warning you!

378
00:57:45,311 --> 00:57:50,136
- I also need a piece of ass.
- What's he saying?

379
00:57:51,398 --> 00:57:55,346
I said,
I also need a piece of ass.

380
00:58:27,751 --> 00:58:30,999
We have
three different types of cartons.

381
00:58:31,211 --> 00:58:35,871
This is for our Super Durable Brake
Shoe. This for our Super Brake Shoe.

382
00:58:36,089 --> 00:58:41,460
And this is for our Standard Brake Shoe.
And here are the brake shoes.

383
00:58:41,675 --> 00:58:45,374
- How do I tell them apart?
- You don't.

384
00:58:45,594 --> 00:58:48,166
Just divide them into thirds.

385
00:58:48,387 --> 00:58:52,632
When you've finished
we'll find something else.

386
00:58:52,848 --> 00:58:56,974
- When do I start?
- Now.

387
00:59:02,603 --> 00:59:08,852
And absolutely no smoking up here.
If you have to smoke, come downstairs.

388
00:59:45,627 --> 00:59:49,243
A poem is a city
filled with streets and sewers.

389
00:59:49,462 --> 00:59:54,454
Filled with saints, heroes,
beggars, madmen.

390
00:59:54,673 --> 00:59:57,626
Filled with banality and booze.

391
00:59:57,842 --> 01:00:01,884
Filled with rain and thunder
and periods of drought.

392
01:00:02,094 --> 01:00:04,584
A poem is a city at war.

393
01:00:04,804 --> 01:00:08,634
It's a barbershop
filled with cynical drunks.

394
01:00:08,848 --> 01:00:11,053
A poem is a city.

395
01:00:11,266 --> 01:00:15,308
A poem is a nation.
A poem is the world.

396
01:00:18,936 --> 01:00:21,687
I decided to look for Jan.

397
01:00:21,896 --> 01:00:25,727
I toured the bars in our old
neighborhood looking for her.

398
01:00:25,940 --> 01:00:29,275
The bartender at the Pink Mule -

399
01:00:29,275 --> 01:00:34,433
- told me that she was working as
a chambermaid in a downtown hotel.

400
01:00:53,956 --> 01:00:57,240
Hank!

401
01:00:59,792 --> 01:01:01,748
Jan.

402
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:05,541
I thought I'd never see you again!

403
01:01:05,754 --> 01:01:08,540
Well, here I am.

404
01:01:11,507 --> 01:01:15,170
Let me look at you.

405
01:01:15,384 --> 01:01:18,668
You're thin. You've lost weight.

406
01:01:20,387 --> 01:01:22,959
You're looking good.

407
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:26,014
- Are you alone?
- Yes.

408
01:01:26,223 --> 01:01:28,630
- There's no one else?
- Nobody.

409
01:01:28,850 --> 01:01:33,142
You know I can't stand people.

410
01:01:33,352 --> 01:01:37,811
Well, good to see you working.

411
01:01:40,481 --> 01:01:43,434
Come on.

412
01:01:57,907 --> 01:02:03,658
- I'm embarrassed.
- I love you, you idiot.

413
01:02:03,869 --> 01:02:07,865
We've fucked 800 times, so relax.

414
01:02:09,122 --> 01:02:13,367
- Still like my legs?
- Hell yes.

415
01:02:13,582 --> 01:02:16,950
Have you finished with your work?

416
01:02:17,168 --> 01:02:22,207
All but Mr. Clark's room.
He doesn't care. He leaves me tips.

417
01:02:22,421 --> 01:02:26,915
I'm not doing anything.
He just leaves me tips.

418
01:02:31,801 --> 01:02:34,635
Jan?

419
01:02:39,138 --> 01:02:42,505
I love you, baby.

420
01:02:42,723 --> 01:02:45,011
Bastard.

421
01:02:45,225 --> 01:02:50,383
When I came home one night,
she had moved in with me.

422
01:03:05,194 --> 01:03:08,941
I decided to clean up the apartment.

423
01:03:09,154 --> 01:03:13,482
I thought
I must be turning into a fag.

424
01:03:33,418 --> 01:03:36,038
Where is she?

425
01:03:36,253 --> 01:03:40,628
Where is the bitch
who cleaned the place?

426
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:54,585
If I find her,
I'm going to kill her. I swear.

427
01:03:58,723 --> 01:04:02,933
You're going to pay for this, Chinaski.

428
01:04:17,317 --> 01:04:22,937
She was continually using our
arguments to justify herself.

429
01:04:23,153 --> 01:04:26,402
It was just a cover for her own guilt.

430
01:04:26,613 --> 01:04:30,111
She'd go off
with anyone she met in a bar.

431
01:04:30,324 --> 01:04:34,272
And the lower and the dirtier he was
the better she liked it.

432
01:04:38,495 --> 01:04:42,740
She left and I got drunk
for three days and three nights.

433
01:04:42,956 --> 01:04:47,865
When I sobered up
I knew my job was gone.

434
01:04:54,587 --> 01:04:59,923
Hello? I was told
you might be looking for reporters.

435
01:05:00,132 --> 01:05:03,215
Please fill this out.

436
01:05:35,026 --> 01:05:38,191
Bastard!

437
01:05:43,906 --> 01:05:49,028
Apply this ointment to the invaded parts
an wash off after 20-30 minutes.

438
01:05:49,242 --> 01:05:54,400
Under no circumstances leave it on
longer than 30 minutes.

439
01:05:54,620 --> 01:05:56,658
Thank you.

440
01:06:19,425 --> 01:06:22,460
Hell! 30 minutes?

441
01:06:22,677 --> 01:06:27,751
I'll leave it on all night
and kill every one of these fuckers.

442
01:06:54,653 --> 01:06:57,403
Shit!

443
01:06:58,738 --> 01:07:00,611
Hank?

444
01:07:00,823 --> 01:07:03,775
- You fucking whore!
- What?

445
01:07:03,991 --> 01:07:07,323
- Look what you've done to me!
- What is it?

446
01:07:07,535 --> 01:07:10,238
Don't you know?

447
01:07:10,453 --> 01:07:17,331
I haven't fucked anybody else! I got it
from you. You're a diseased ridden slut!

448
01:07:17,540 --> 01:07:20,374
Crabs, baby! You gave me crabs.

449
01:07:20,583 --> 01:07:23,785
No. Geraldine must have them.

450
01:07:24,002 --> 01:07:27,868
I was sitting on her toilet.

451
01:07:28,087 --> 01:07:31,372
You got it off a toilet seat?

452
01:07:31,589 --> 01:07:35,039
Give me a goddamn drink.

453
01:07:40,219 --> 01:07:42,424
What do you want?

454
01:07:42,637 --> 01:07:44,428
Yes?

455
01:07:45,889 --> 01:07:48,130
Yes?

456
01:07:48,348 --> 01:07:51,383
As a reporter?

457
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:54,932
Not as a reporter?

458
01:07:55,144 --> 01:07:58,143
Today?

459
01:07:58,354 --> 01:08:01,307
Okay. Thanks.

460
01:08:02,731 --> 01:08:05,482
Who was that?

461
01:08:05,691 --> 01:08:09,901
- I got a job.
- I'll fix you up.

462
01:08:11,319 --> 01:08:14,734
I can't wear pants.

463
01:08:17,156 --> 01:08:21,780
- I'll rap you up in gauze.
- Will that work?

464
01:08:23,743 --> 01:08:27,655
Easy does it.

465
01:08:27,870 --> 01:08:32,779
- Put it right around...
- Easy.

466
01:08:35,041 --> 01:08:38,823
- Anybody tell you how funny you are?
- No.

467
01:08:39,043 --> 01:08:42,291
That's understandable.

468
01:08:42,503 --> 01:08:46,285
Now, for a little tape.

469
01:08:48,131 --> 01:08:54,001
- Put the other leg up, lover.
- Never mind the romance.

470
01:08:54,218 --> 01:08:59,091
Around your big fat thighs.

471
01:08:59,304 --> 01:09:03,679
- Not as big as your big fat ass.
- No, no, be nice now.

472
01:09:05,432 --> 01:09:11,432
Now the balls. Your little red balls.
Just in time for Christmas.

473
01:09:11,644 --> 01:09:14,809
- What will you do with my balls?
- Rap them.

474
01:09:15,021 --> 01:09:19,099
It might affect my tap-dancing.

475
01:09:19,315 --> 01:09:24,983
- Wrap that around like that and tie.
- They'll slip out.

476
01:09:25,193 --> 01:09:28,643
In a cocoon. Real nice.

477
01:09:31,947 --> 01:09:37,152
That's better. A little bit of tape.

478
01:09:37,366 --> 01:09:42,406
- Don't tape my balls to my asshole.
- That's the best place for them, baby.

479
01:09:44,245 --> 01:09:47,328
You're as good as new.

480
01:09:47,539 --> 01:09:50,906
Get up and walk around.

481
01:10:07,633 --> 01:10:11,581
This is all right!

482
01:10:11,802 --> 01:10:15,050
I feel like a eunuch, -

483
01:10:15,262 --> 01:10:18,712
- but this is all right.

484
01:10:18,931 --> 01:10:22,974
- Want some soft boiled eggs?
- Sure, baby.

485
01:10:28,353 --> 01:10:31,021
Call for help if you
need to move the lift.

486
01:10:31,229 --> 01:10:35,604
We're very proud of this guy.
It's called 'Vision of Peace'.

487
01:11:05,706 --> 01:11:09,572
Why was I chosen to do this?

488
01:11:09,792 --> 01:11:12,708
Why couldn't I
be inside writing editorials -

489
01:11:12,919 --> 01:11:16,749
- about municipal corruption?

490
01:11:16,962 --> 01:11:21,005
Give the readers
my vision of peace.

491
01:11:21,215 --> 01:11:25,921
Questions like these
demanded deeper consideration.

492
01:11:57,610 --> 01:12:02,269
Superintendent Barnes.
Can I buy you a beer?

493
01:12:02,487 --> 01:12:09,234
You are fired, Mr. Chinaski. Return
your uniform and clean out your locker.

494
01:12:09,449 --> 01:12:12,402
Yes, sir.

495
01:12:18,288 --> 01:12:21,702
- Is that you, Hank?
- Yeah, baby.

496
01:12:32,295 --> 01:12:35,129
I got canned.

497
01:12:35,339 --> 01:12:38,338
Caught me drinking on the job.

498
01:12:38,549 --> 01:12:41,548
What about your check?

499
01:12:41,759 --> 01:12:46,086
Funny, they didn't mention it.

500
01:12:46,303 --> 01:12:50,630
You worked almost a full day.
They owe you wages.

501
01:12:50,847 --> 01:12:54,182
Yes, they do.

502
01:12:54,182 --> 01:12:59,257
We go get it,
as soon as the office opens.

503
01:12:59,477 --> 01:13:02,227
Okay.

504
01:13:22,739 --> 01:13:28,360
Let's hit the marked for some stewed
meat and vegetables and French wine.

505
01:13:28,576 --> 01:13:33,994
- They old me the check wasn't ready.
- What? It's the law.

506
01:13:35,413 --> 01:13:39,030
They said it would be ready tomorrow.

507
01:13:39,248 --> 01:13:43,244
Christ, I've walked
all this way in high heels!

508
01:13:43,459 --> 01:13:47,372
You look great, baby.

509
01:14:50,662 --> 01:14:55,536
It pays to be a tough son of a bitch.
The world belongs to people with balls.

510
01:14:55,748 --> 01:14:58,665
Just get the check, daddy.

511
01:15:08,631 --> 01:15:11,879
I'm Henry Chinaski.

512
01:15:12,091 --> 01:15:15,873
- Yes?
- I was here yesterday.

513
01:15:16,093 --> 01:15:18,796
Yes?

514
01:15:19,011 --> 01:15:23,470
You told me
my check would be ready today.

515
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:27,463
- Oh.
- That's right.

516
01:15:34,019 --> 01:15:37,967
I'm sorry.
Your check isn't here yet.

517
01:15:38,188 --> 01:15:41,188
But you said it would be.

518
01:15:41,398 --> 01:15:45,774
I'm sorry.
Sometimes it takes a little longer.

519
01:15:45,984 --> 01:15:49,233
I want my check!

520
01:15:50,820 --> 01:15:54,188
I'm sorry, sir.

521
01:15:54,406 --> 01:15:56,942
You're not sorry.

522
01:15:57,157 --> 01:16:02,066
You don't know what sorrow is. I do.

523
01:16:02,285 --> 01:16:06,494
I want to talk to
your boss's boss. Now!

524
01:16:12,999 --> 01:16:14,623
Mr. Handler?

525
01:16:14,833 --> 01:16:20,501
A Mr. Chinaski would like to see you
about a termination payroll check.

526
01:16:22,212 --> 01:16:24,667
Right.

527
01:16:29,925 --> 01:16:32,593
Room 309.

528
01:16:32,801 --> 01:16:34,959
Thank you.

529
01:16:35,178 --> 01:16:39,553
Me and my old lady walked
down here now, two days running -

530
01:16:39,764 --> 01:16:44,340
- just to be told
that you don't have my check.

531
01:16:44,558 --> 01:16:48,933
Now, you and I know that's pure crap.

532
01:16:50,228 --> 01:16:55,053
All I want to do
is get my check and get drunk.

533
01:16:55,272 --> 01:17:00,062
That may not sound noble.

534
01:17:00,275 --> 01:17:04,734
But it's my choice.

535
01:17:06,903 --> 01:17:10,437
You got a smoke?

536
01:17:25,747 --> 01:17:28,533
Thank you.

537
01:17:38,421 --> 01:17:40,626
Miss Simms?

538
01:17:40,839 --> 01:17:45,582
There's a check due
to Mr. Henry Chinaski.

539
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:50,958
Yes. Henry Chinaski.
I want it down in five minutes.

540
01:17:52,470 --> 01:17:54,758
Thank you.

541
01:17:58,598 --> 01:18:04,598
Listen, John, I've got two years
of journalism at L. A. City College.

542
01:18:05,936 --> 01:18:11,354
- You couldn't use a reporter?
- Sorry, we're overstaffed now.

543
01:18:11,564 --> 01:18:14,599
I see.

544
01:18:14,816 --> 01:18:18,017
Your check will be downstairs.

545
01:18:20,152 --> 01:18:23,068
Thank you.

546
01:18:43,665 --> 01:18:48,704
You might as well not have any ears.
You never listen to me anymore.

547
01:18:48,917 --> 01:18:52,960
That's because
you keep repeating yourself.

548
01:18:53,170 --> 01:18:57,331
Let's have a drink and talk about it.

549
01:18:59,673 --> 01:19:03,716
You've had your ass up in the air
ever since we got back together.

550
01:19:41,530 --> 01:19:44,019
Shit.

551
01:19:45,740 --> 01:19:49,075
Let's face the obvious:

552
01:19:49,075 --> 01:19:55,241
I don't need you
and you don't need me.

553
01:20:01,457 --> 01:20:05,500
Yeah. I know.

554
01:20:32,182 --> 01:20:38,134
A week later Jan moved out
and shacked up with some rich guy.

555
01:20:38,352 --> 01:20:43,012
After that I couldn't pay the rent.

556
01:20:54,653 --> 01:20:59,858
- The landlord threw you out?
- Yeah.

557
01:21:00,072 --> 01:21:02,823
Did you get the job?

558
01:21:03,032 --> 01:21:06,815
- No. They didn't want me.
- Why not?

559
01:21:07,035 --> 01:21:10,947
I don't have an address.

560
01:21:13,455 --> 01:21:18,328
Hank, I hate it when he fucks me.

561
01:21:18,541 --> 01:21:22,916
Sure, baby. Take care.

562
01:21:24,794 --> 01:21:28,790
This is for you.
It got too small for him.

563
01:21:32,257 --> 01:21:35,209
See you around, Hank.

564
01:21:43,888 --> 01:21:46,841
You'll manage.

565
01:22:14,863 --> 01:22:18,811
Amazing, how grimly
we hold onto our misery.

566
01:22:19,032 --> 01:22:23,526
The energy we burn fueling our anger.

567
01:22:26,703 --> 01:22:30,781
Amazing, how one moment
we can be snarling like a beast, -

568
01:22:30,997 --> 01:22:35,123
- then a few moments later
forgetting what or why.

569
01:22:35,333 --> 01:22:39,827
Not hours
or days or months or years, -

570
01:22:40,044 --> 01:22:45,083
- but decades,
lifetimes completely used up -

571
01:22:45,297 --> 01:22:49,506
- given over to
the pettiest rancor and hatred.

572
01:22:49,716 --> 01:22:55,549
Finally there is nothing here
for death to take away.

573
01:23:26,736 --> 01:23:31,028
Sit down
and we'll see if anything comes in.

574
01:23:43,453 --> 01:23:47,994
You look a little down in the mouth.
You all right?

575
01:23:48,206 --> 01:23:51,620
I lost a woman.

576
01:23:51,833 --> 01:23:57,287
You'll have others.
And you'll lose them too.

577
01:23:57,503 --> 01:24:01,119
Where do they go?

578
01:24:01,338 --> 01:24:06,543
Try this.
Ain't no women on skid row.

579
01:24:09,384 --> 01:24:14,803
Don't let him see us drinking.
That's the one thing he don't like.

580
01:24:15,012 --> 01:24:18,177
Keep it low.

581
01:24:26,393 --> 01:24:29,642
- Wine gnats.
- Sons of bitches are hooked.

582
01:24:29,854 --> 01:24:34,063
They know what's good.

583
01:24:34,273 --> 01:24:38,138
They drink to forget their women.

584
01:24:38,358 --> 01:24:41,939
They just drink.

585
01:24:42,152 --> 01:24:45,068
- Oh, shit.
- Here he comes!

586
01:24:45,279 --> 01:24:49,488
All right! Get out, you winos!

587
01:24:49,698 --> 01:24:52,900
Get out before I call the cops!

588
01:24:55,701 --> 01:24:59,234
Let's go! Get out of here!

589
01:24:59,453 --> 01:25:04,872
Out! I call the cops, you god damn
degenerates! And don't come back!

590
01:25:08,166 --> 01:25:12,411
What? This isn't a bar!

591
01:25:16,045 --> 01:25:18,915
Sun's up.

592
01:25:19,130 --> 01:25:22,747
Yeah, the sun's up good.

593
01:25:37,557 --> 01:25:40,557
Well, I got to get going.

594
01:25:47,271 --> 01:25:49,559
See you.

595
01:26:11,826 --> 01:26:14,909
So, what do I do with Chinaski's mail?

596
01:26:15,119 --> 01:26:18,285
He's gone. Just give it to me.

597
01:26:18,496 --> 01:26:21,247
Have a nice day.

598
01:26:59,477 --> 01:27:01,101
Dear Mr. Chinaski.

599
01:27:01,311 --> 01:27:05,390
We are returning four stories,
but keeping My Beerdrunk Soul -

600
01:27:05,605 --> 01:27:09,103
"- is Sadder Than All the Dead
Christmas Trees of the World.

601
01:27:09,316 --> 01:27:14,770
We have been watching your work
and are happy to accept this story.

602
01:27:14,985 --> 01:27:19,562
Sincerely,
John Martin, Black Sparrow Press.

603
01:27:44,752 --> 01:27:49,411
If you are going to try,
go all the way.

604
01:27:49,629 --> 01:27:52,582
Otherwise don't even start.

605
01:27:52,798 --> 01:27:57,790
This could mean losing girlfriends,
wives, relatives, jobs.

606
01:27:58,009 --> 01:28:00,759
And maybe your mind.

607
01:28:00,969 --> 01:28:04,502
It could mean
not eating for three or four days.

608
01:28:04,721 --> 01:28:07,590
It could mean
freezing on a park bench.

609
01:28:07,806 --> 01:28:10,722
It could mean jail.

610
01:28:10,933 --> 01:28:15,094
It could mean mockery, isolation.

611
01:28:17,311 --> 01:28:22,849
Isolation is the gift. All the others
are a test of your endurance.

612
01:28:23,064 --> 01:28:30,143
Of how much you really want to do it.
And you'll do it, despite rejection.

613
01:28:30,360 --> 01:28:34,403
And it will be better than
anything else you can imagine.

614
01:28:37,405 --> 01:28:42,231
If you're going to try,
go all the way.

615
01:28:42,450 --> 01:28:47,110
There is no other feeling like that.
You will be alone with the gods.

616
01:28:47,327 --> 01:28:50,244
And the nights will flame with fire.

617
01:28:50,454 --> 01:28:53,987
You will ride life
straight to perfect laughter.

618
01:28:54,206 --> 01:28:59,447
It's the only good fight there is.

619
01:29:06,922 --> 01:29:09,411
