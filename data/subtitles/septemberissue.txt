1
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:33,000
I thinkwhat I often see is that people
are frightened of fashion,

2
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,840
and that...

3
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:37,440
...because it scares them
or it makes them feel insecure,

4
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:39,540
they put it down.

5
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:44,680
On the whole,
people that say demeaning things...

6
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:47,940
...about our world,

7
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:52,000
I think that's usually
because they feel in some ways...

8
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:56,540
...excluded or, you know,
not part of the cool group.

9
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:59,470
So as a result, they just mock it.

10
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:05,960
Just because you like to put on
a beautiful Carolina Herrera dress...

11
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,220
...or a, I don't know,

12
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:12,320
pair of J Brand blue jeans that,
you know,

13
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,960
instead of something basic
from K-Mart,

14
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,545
it doesn't mean
that you're a dumb person.

15
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:25,990
There is something about fashion
that can make people very nervous.

16
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,320
Sophie, hi.

17
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:38,920
This email here from Tom Ford,
can you send it on to Jay?

18
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:41,020
Okay, thanks.

19
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:54,260
Anna Wintour's office.

20
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,320
Kate, there's a bit of a crisis.

21
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,500
Anna saw the pictures,

22
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,685
and she doesn't
want Chanel or Hilary.

23
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,640
Okay. Bye.

24
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:16,480
So I think we're done
with Hilary and Chanel.

25
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,200
I wonder if Anna
would like this one.

26
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,000
It's black.

27
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,000
That's true.

28
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,460
I'd get fired for that.

29
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,760
These are the approved ones
that Mark and I showed Anna.

30
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,880
But also Anna
did not like the Landing page,

31
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,560
and we have redesigned it,

32
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,680
and that's what
we're showing Anna tomorrow.

33
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,280
Okay.

34
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,080
It is always going
to be Anna's point of view.

35
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,340
Vogue is Anna's magazine.

36
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:51,720
That's who signs it off.

37
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,820
We know that.

38
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,920
You belong to it.
You belong to this church.

39
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:03,280
And is it fair to say that Anna is
the high priestess of all of us?

40
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,380
I would say pope.

41
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,040
L'Oreal's meeting with Anna...

42
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:15,600
...to talk about having the designers
design an infallible dress.

43
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:16,800
That's perfect.

44
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:20,960
She sees her role as the director
and producer of this fashion world.

45
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,600
Can you think of an aspect
of the fashion industry...

46
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,930
...that she isn't somehow involved in?

47
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,580
No.

48
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,020
We have to see clothes.

49
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,320
First of all,
it's been a very bleak week so far.

50
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,640
It's been Bleak Street
over here in America.

51
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,760
You know what?
It's a famine of beauty.

52
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,080
Right.
We're gonna have some beauty.

53
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:45,640
It's a famine of beauty, honey.

54
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:48,460
My eyes are starving for beauty.

55
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,120
More light.

56
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,840
You don't have to go too fast,

57
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,520
but good energy,
good confidence.

58
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,520
Julie, they're wondering
is Anna here yet?

59
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:59,640
There is she, there.

60
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:03,310
Ready to start. Here we go.
We're gonna go.

61
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,520
I'm with the internationally renowned
editor-in-chief...

62
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,400
...of American Vogue,
Anna Wintour.

63
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,800
Anna Wintour's the editor-in-chief
of Vogue magazine,

64
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,320
a bible for the fashion world.

65
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,760
The single most important figure...

66
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:24,160
...in the $300 billion
global fashion industry.

67
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:29,530
She is watched more closely
than the movie stars or the runway.

68
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:37,145
Well, this week, it was pretty cold,
that's all I can say.

69
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,180
Anna.

70
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,100
Anna, look.

71
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,780
It's gorgeous.

72
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,640
Is there a way to wear fur
this winter?

73
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,760
There's always a way to wear fur.

74
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,580
Personally,
I have it on my back.

75
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,480
What is your role at Day Finis?
Will you explain?

76
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,880
What is my role
at the Day Finis?

77
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:51,280
To help Anna Wintour decide
what goes in the magazine...

78
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:57,160
...and to help the editors of Vogue
to have a dialogue about fashion.

79
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:37,840
Hi, Stefano.

80
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,720
Anna, how are you?
- I'm well.

81
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,200
Good to see you.
- How are things?

82
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:45,300
Uh, well.
Shall I tell you the truth?

83
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,340
Yeah.

84
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,500
You're stressed?

85
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,180
Hello.

86
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,320
Good to see you.

87
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,640
Good to see you.

88
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:02,660
Stefano, can we start?
- Yes. Okay.

89
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:07,405
I'll show them
three by three.

90
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,600
So this is look number one.

91
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:15,590
Okay, you just walk around easily.

92
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:20,200
Voila. So this season,
basically what I decide to work on...

93
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,320
...is to go back to
the essence of the cut.

94
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:26,020
Everything is hand-stitched,
all around.

95
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:28,060
Wow.

96
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:30,960
I don't see any real evening
on that rack.

97
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,080
You're not doing it?

98
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,600
No, I am.
- But?

99
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,120
But they're all--
- In pieces?

100
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,080
Yes.

101
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,280
Do we have sketches?
- I have one cocktail dress.

102
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:42,160
But this is the workmanship,
which is this one.

103
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,520
No. Did you see that, no?

104
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,200
No, that's pretty.

105
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,320
So, you're not really feeling
for color, Stefano.

106
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,420
No.

107
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:53,620
No. You know,
it's my mood.

108
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:56,400
I mean, in winter,
I never feel so much for color.

109
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,640
It's more
a summer thing for me,

110
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,780
frankly speaking, but...

111
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:05,220
It's a bit neutral. New blacks.

112
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,640
I don't know.

113
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,080
There's blue navy.

114
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:10,390
There is an emerald green.

115
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,280
This is colorful.

116
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,280
Okay, I'm gonna need you...

117
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:23,040
...when I'm convincing Anna
that that's not black.

118
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:25,140
We have green, navy.

119
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:29,640
Good morning.

120
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,120
How are you?

121
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,200
You look beautiful.

122
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,200
Are you wearing Chanel?

123
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,280
Yes. Trying to look
like your customer.

124
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,380
You are our customer.

125
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,860
So we'll follow you.

126
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:42,120
Thank you for continuing
these breakfasts.

127
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:45,200
I speak for the group,
they're very helpful,

128
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:48,280
and continue to allow us to get to know
each other better and better,

129
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:51,015
and we thank you for your time.

130
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:56,160
So I'm going to ask Sally
to start talking about our main points.

131
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,640
The key item for us,
it seems to be, is the jacket.

132
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,920
We're going to be putting
a huge, huge push...

133
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:05,000
...onto a wardrobe of jackets
for the fall issues.

134
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,320
Nobody was wearing fur...

135
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,760
...until Anna put it back
on the cover of Vogue...

136
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,080
...back in the early nineties.

137
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:12,240
And she ignited
the entire industry.

138
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:15,460
If we get behind something,
it sells.

139
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,800
For once, Prada was
in great debate this season.

140
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,760
Anna had a lot of concerns
over the fabric...

141
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:24,400
...and spoke with Mrs. Prada
on your behalf many times.

142
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,160
We thought that the pieces
were just so heavy...

143
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,720
...that you couldn't wear it.

144
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:30,080
So, Virginia, what was it
that they're going to reinterpret?

145
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,320
'Cause we really pushed.

146
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:34,600
They did tell me that they
are doing a version of a fabric...

147
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,480
...that's silk and mohair as opposed
to the heavy wool and mohair.

148
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,920
It's a degrade fabric.

149
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,840
Fantastic. Thank you.

150
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,940
Good.

151
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,520
You've made our week,
our three weeks.

152
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:48,800
Let me touch on something
that may be out of your purview,

153
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,535
but maybe you can also help us.

154
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:55,020
Deliveries of merchandise.

155
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,080
What do you want me
to do about that?

156
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,560
Rent a truck?

157
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,480
I tell you
what I'd like you to do.

158
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:02,400
You are so influential
with the designers.

159
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,500
Not that.

160
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,160
They have to recognize...

161
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,160
...that the worldwide demand
for their product...

162
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:11,040
...is expanding at a rate
that even they don't understand,

163
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:13,080
and they're not keeping up
with the production...

164
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:16,080
...so that the demand
is outstripping supply.

165
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,680
We're waiting longer and longer
and longer for deliveries.

166
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:21,680
They're coming at the back end
of the delivery schedule...

167
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:22,640
...instead of the front end.

168
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:26,360
And, you know, fashion is fun,
and we all love it,

169
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,760
and that's what drives it, but...

170
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,520
You want it now.
- without the goods--...

171
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:32,240
...and the ads in your magazines
are fabulous,

172
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:37,440
and I know you'll look like
a telephone book this year, but--

173
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,080
You've gotta help us with this.

174
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,960
So, you have
a couple of choices.

175
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,520
You can start
sewing yourselves.

176
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,360
No, I think you said something
very interesting, Burt,

177
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,400
which is editing.

178
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,240
And I think some of the designers
do have a problem with that,

179
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,480
and we are working on that,
and we will certainly...

180
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:54,980
We're right there with you.
Less is more.

181
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,320
I mean, I can't shoot everything
for the rest of my life...

182
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,440
...with Steven Meisel
in Alder Mansion,

183
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:11,175
which is an ugly fucking house.

184
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:18,000
I was discussing my September shoot
with Steven Klein.

185
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,760
I think he
really likes this location.

186
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,040
It's sort of gloomy, Edward.

187
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,140
Where's the glamour?

188
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,960
It's Vogue, okay?
Please, let's--...

189
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,080
Lift it.
- Lift it.

190
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,520
I don't find her to be hidden.

191
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:32,440
I just don't find her
to be accessible...

192
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:35,240
...to people she doesn't need
to be accessible to.

193
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,880
This, I don't think we need.

194
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,880
We'll just wait
for whatever it is they're making.

195
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,040
And that's it.

196
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,320
This, I don't think we should do.

197
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:44,000
This, I don't think we should do.
This.

198
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,100
She's busy, you know.

199
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,000
And she's not warm and friendly.

200
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,440
She's doing her business.

201
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:52,200
These are all horrible.
- Yes.

202
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,160
I thought this was pretty weak.
- It is.

203
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,080
That stuff needs a lot of work.

204
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,760
Okay.
- All right?

205
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:58,920
We leave warm to me.

206
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:02,845
I'll have to be warm enough
for the two of us.

207
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:07,200
When we put out
the September issue of Vogue,

208
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:10,240
the first thing
the reporters usually ask us...

209
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:14,660
...is how much does it weigh
and how many pages?

210
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:18,520
One in ten American women,
almost thirteen million people,

211
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,360
will get that issue.

212
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:22,960
A few years ago when we put out
a record issue of September,

213
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:25,800
it was the largest monthly magazine
ever published.

214
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,480
Guys, we're looking
to break that record.

215
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,800
We have to break rules.

216
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:32,720
I want you to go into it
like it's Vogue the brand...

217
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,120
...and market it
like it's never been marketed...

218
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,515
...in its entire 114 years.

219
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,760
All right, so, September.

220
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:43,400
Sienna, I think
we're in excellent shape, right?

221
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,720
It's all feathers.

222
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,000
I think this is really cute.

223
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:46,960
I do, too.
- Do you?

224
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:47,960
Big Bird.

225
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,760
The team sees the collections...

226
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:52,000
...and then comes back
and has fashion meetings,

227
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,760
and in the meetings,
you dissect the collections...

228
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:57,080
...and decide
what trends to feature.

229
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,320
Andre, I hear you didn't like Calvin.

230
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,630
I thought it was clinical.

231
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:07,180
September is the January
in fashion, you know?

232
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,440
This is when I change.

233
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,900
This is when I say,

234
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,400
I'm gonna try to get back
on those high heels...

235
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,920
'cause that's the look.

236
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,840
Yeah, the jacket
is the new coat.

237
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:19,440
The look is sexy.
The look is granny.

238
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:20,520
You need to know.

239
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:22,600
This is heaven.
That's gorgeous.

240
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,720
That should be a fashion story.

241
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,160
But that's the problem, Grace.

242
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,640
It's an accessory story,
and that's what I need.

243
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,440
Well, it's a story crying to be done.

244
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:30,480
Grace, I hear you,

245
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,360
but it's just not what I need
in the September issue.

246
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:35,120
You have to
really find some stories there.

247
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:38,000
And you have to find stories that
haven't been played out anywhere else,

248
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,200
and they have to be
on a certain scale.

249
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,000
Having talked to Grace
a little bit about this,

250
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,920
I think she very much
wants to do texture.

251
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:47,400
What has that got to do
with texture?

252
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,840
Well, look.

253
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,940
No.

254
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:53,680
I think you should bring it anyway.
- It's breaking my heart.

255
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:57,760
Usually in the September issue,
there's one big disaster.

256
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:01,040
There's always one shoot
that's a big problem in the issue,

257
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:06,325
because it's a big issue
and there's a lot of things going on.

258
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:16,370
Let's put that one
to the side for now.

259
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,040
And that one, too.

260
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,040
Let me see what else there is.

261
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:22,280
Jonathan Saunders
is someone we wanted to--

262
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,440
We're trying to get him in.

263
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,000
It's cute,
but it's a different thing.

264
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,395
They're not color blocking.

265
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:34,215
You want to kill yourself? Why?

266
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:35,840
What's happened?

267
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,940
This got thrown out.

268
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,120
If it's with this.

269
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,240
This is what we did.
- It's fine.

270
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,880
It wasn't the look. She said no.

271
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:45,280
Color blocking's
all the different colors.

272
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:47,560
It's this with this
and this with this.

273
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,440
I'm gonna take this anyway.

274
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,600
Is that the best one?
That's not the best one.

275
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,000
You've gotta be tougher.
Edward.

276
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,120
Tell me, what do you do?

277
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,760
You gotta be tough.
- What'd you do?

278
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,840
You've gotta just demand.

279
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,680
You have to demand.

280
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:03,840
Because, otherwise,
you'll be blamed.

281
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:08,410
Don't be too nice, even to me.

282
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,140
No, honestly, because...

283
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,560
...you'll lose.

284
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:18,040
You have to learn the way
to beat your path through...

285
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:23,380
...to make yourself felt
and make yourself necessary...

286
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:27,540
...and find a way that works
for you for Vogue.

287
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:30,360
Because a lot of people have come,
and a lot of people have gone.

288
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:33,560
They just couldn't take
the heartbreak.

289
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:38,335
You know, you have to be
fairly tough to withstand that.

290
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,920
So it's all pinks.

291
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:44,400
And, Virginia, we really feel that
this is the most important message...

292
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,305
...to put in the September issue?

293
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:49,920
I loved it.
- It's important.

294
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,080
I thought it was pretty.

295
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,760
It looks very springy.

296
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,320
Well, there's a fur.

297
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,480
Maybe you want to develop it
a little bit more.

298
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:59,080
I'd also like to see what you're
thinking about with the clothes,

299
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:01,400
so I can get
more of a handle on it.

300
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:06,040
I was thinking maybe it's
kind of body conscious, the clothes.

301
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:09,320
And then at one point, I thought
maybe she could be sort of bionic.

302
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,640
It looks good on the rack.

303
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:13,040
I feel it's quite one-dimensional.

304
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:16,160
But also, the girls
always look the same, Elissa.

305
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,200
If you look at your pictures,

306
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,280
the way they're dressed,
it's always the same.

307
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,040
And somehow,
the picture's always the same.

308
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:24,560
It's usually the same kind
of minimal approach.

309
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,760
I mean, it's what you are, I know.

310
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,440
And the girl always tends
to have straight hair.

311
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:32,080
You look at it just
like it's always the same.

312
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,360
So it would be great
if we could break out.

313
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,460
Thanks.

314
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,440
So you know that company,
Mango, in Spain?

315
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:43,920
They're looking for someone
to help them consult.

316
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,480
Maybe Thakoon, you think?

317
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:49,160
I think he's one of
the most talented people out there.

318
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,800
He's coming in to see me,
I think, this week,

319
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:53,450
so I could talk to him.
- Okay.

320
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:08,470
So, Yuri, can we stop
at Starbucks, please?

321
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,280
My father was
a newspaper editor.

322
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:26,160
He edited a newspaper in London
called The Evening Standard.

323
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:28,040
Former Fleet Street editor,
Charles Wintour,

324
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,840
will be assessing
the long-term effects.

325
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:33,080
He came from quite
a Victorian upbringing.

326
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:36,665
I'm not sure his mother
ever spoke to him.

327
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:41,840
He was also very private
and very, in some ways, inscrutable.

328
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,560
The NPA have about
as much collective spine...

329
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,700
...as a tepid jellyfish.

330
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,520
Growing up in London
in the sixties,

331
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,320
I mean, you'd have to be
walking around...

332
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,240
...with lrving Penn's sack
over your head...

333
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,160
...not to know that something
extraordinary...

334
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,640
...was happening in fashion.

335
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,840
The look of the girls then
and everything that was going on,

336
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:06,800
the pill
and emancipation of women...

337
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,200
...and the end
of the class system...

338
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:12,800
...and just sort of seeing
that revolution go on,

339
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,790
made me love it from an early age.

340
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:23,120
I think my father
really decided for me...

341
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,840
...that I should work in fashion.

342
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:27,280
I can't remember what form
it was I had to fill out.

343
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,080
Maybe it was
an admissions thing,

344
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:33,600
and at the bottom, it said
'career objectives,' you know.

345
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:34,960
and I looked at it and said,
'What shall I do?

346
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:36,080
'How shall I fill this out? '

347
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,280
And he said, well, you write...

348
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,760
...that you want to be editor
of Vogue, of course.

349
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:41,540
So, that was it.
It was decided.

350
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,040
We have known
about this piece for a long time.

351
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,840
So I don't wanna hear it, okay?

352
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,760
I mean, she should
just get on the phone.

353
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,360
This is not clear.

354
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,880
Somebody needs to check these.

355
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:57,040
She looks pregnant.
We need to--...

356
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,140
Fix her.
- Yeah.

357
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:04,800
The first time that you're asked
to go see Anna...

358
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,440
...and show her your collection,
it's like...

359
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:09,360
...insane.
- lntimidating. Right.

360
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:12,760
And I remember there was me
and Meredith in Anna's office.

361
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,640
It was the first time I met her.

362
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:16,080
I was, like, oh, my God,
it's Anna.

363
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:18,960
It's like Madonna is Anna,
you know?

364
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:22,160
And I was just--
She's like, 'Okay, go on.'

365
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,200
So I'm talking
about the inspiration.

366
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:28,440
I'm moving my hands,
and I'm showing her the pieces.

367
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:30,840
And I can see my hand shaking.

368
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,720
It was shaking.

369
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,280
Because she just sat there
the whole time,

370
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:35,960
Iike, 'Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.'

371
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,720
So then we, we get out of there,

372
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,480
and Meredith's like, 'Oh, my God,
you were so well-spoken,'

373
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:41,875
but that hand kept shaking.

374
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,000
Anna Wintour's office.

375
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,880
Hi, Thakoon. How are you?
- Hi, are you?

376
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,720
I have eight sketches.

377
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,280
I don't know how you want me
to lay them out for you.

378
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,420
Right here.

379
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,160
You know Thakoon, right?
- Yes.

380
00:19:55,260 --> 00:20:00,580
So these are his sketches
for the Gap project, the shirts.

381
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:01,960
And it's three that would--

382
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,480
We're meant to narrow it down
to three?

383
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:06,440
I think we ought to do one
with a little sleeve.

384
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,600
I love the little sleeve.

385
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:10,320
And then maybe one
that's a dress.

386
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:12,520
It's very hard to be a designer
in this country.

387
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:17,280
So we created a fashion fund
to draw attention to new talent,

388
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:19,960
to fund it,
and to get mentoring for it.

389
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:22,800
The winners get to design
something for a mega-brand.

390
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:23,960
You like this one?

391
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:24,960
I wouldn't discount that.

392
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:27,080
It's got a simplicity
that the Gap customer...

393
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:29,640
...is going to
immediately acknowledge.

394
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:32,520
Thakoon was one
of the winners of the award.

395
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:39,220
He has all the components to have
a serious high-end designer line.

396
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,680
I'm happy with those three.

397
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,840
Perfect. All right.
Well, thank you.

398
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,940
Thank you.

399
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:46,640
You never know, though.

400
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,960
I mean, remember lsaac Mizrahi
went out of business.

401
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,440
The fashion business isn't fair.

402
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:55,450
They do everything right,
and they still crash.

403
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,780
Those colors are good.

404
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,120
I'm one of the last remaining
fashion editors...

405
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,640
...who dress the girls myself.

406
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:16,880
I'm told the very modern thing is
to don't touch the girls.

407
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,240
Is that right? Yeah.

408
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:21,145
Who does it? An assistant?
- Yeah.

409
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:25,205
I don't know.
I'm a bit old-fashioned.

410
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:34,405
I love this.
See? I love this.

411
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:39,040
Good, Coco. Watch the light, guys.
Come on.

412
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:42,120
She just looks like
she's got a plastic bag on.

413
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,220
But it looks good.

414
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,625
Garbage bag or something.

415
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:49,630
Good night.
- Good night, everyone.

416
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:00,880
Well, I started reading Vogue
when I was a teenager,

417
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,960
and I grew up in north Wales.

418
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:06,120
And it was kind of difficult to get.

419
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:10,000
So I used to order it and rush
once a month to get my copy,

420
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,560
which was probably three months
out of date.

421
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:13,920
I loved
the whole sort of chic thing...

422
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:18,720
...that was so entirely out of context
compared to the lifestyle I led.

423
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:20,800
You know, I went to school.
I went to a convent.

424
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:23,320
I never went anywhere
for my holidays,

425
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:25,970
and so I just looked at Vogue.

426
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:30,080
At the same time, there was
a Vogue model competition,

427
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:33,665
and somebody sent
my very bad pictures in.

428
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:37,620
And I actually
won the young section.

429
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,560
'Cause I was quite young
at that time.

430
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:42,900
And so I started modeling
for Vogue.

431
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:52,200
Somehow everything I did,
I kind of fell into.

432
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:56,760
I just knew that I probably
had to get out of that place.

433
00:22:56,860 --> 00:23:01,450
So I went up to London,
and I became a full-time model.

434
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:23,540
These are the pictures of me
by various photographers.

435
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:28,240
This is one of
my very first model pictures.

436
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:31,780
It's probably '59 by Lord Snowden.

437
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:38,240
I stopped modeling
because I had a car crash.

438
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,400
My head went
into the driving mirror,

439
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,280
or my eye went
into the driving mirror.

440
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:45,270
So I had a lot of plastic surgery.

441
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:51,220
And then two years later,
I sort of went back to work.

442
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:54,480
This is from a shoot that I did
with Bailey, Helmut.

443
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:55,600
This is Manolo Blahnik,

444
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:58,960
and this is Anjelica Huston
when she was modeling.

445
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:01,840
I was offered a job
at British Vogue.

446
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,400
I was a junior editor,

447
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:08,180
and kind of slowly
worked my way up.

448
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:18,460
Hello.
- Ms. Coddington.

449
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,600
Oh, my God.

450
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,880
How was your shoot?

451
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:23,140
It was great.

452
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:39,410
This is really good, isn't it?

453
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,840
Good, aren't they?

454
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,640
Who styled that?
- Grace, right?

455
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,740
Grace and Craig.

456
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:48,500
It's real nice.
- It's beautiful.

457
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,040
Grace is without question
the greatest living stylist.

458
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:52,080
There's no one better
than Grace.

459
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:55,440
There's no one
who can make any photographer...

460
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:58,640
...take more beautiful, more interesting,
more romantic,

461
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:02,905
more just stunningly realized
pictures than Grace.

462
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:06,400
There's no one better. Period.

463
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,280
She comes
from the idea that fashion...

464
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,480
...is this world of play
and make-believe.

465
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:13,080
It's as if someone's gone to
the dressing-up box...

466
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:15,960
...and found the most
kind of wonderful, personal things...

467
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:17,520
...and put them together.

468
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:19,620
But it's beautiful.

469
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,340
Hi, Anna.
- Hi.

470
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,000
I'm not crazy about this one,
are you?

471
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,100
I like it.

472
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:31,220
Do we need this?

473
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:34,560
It's just not saying texture to me.
All the others, l--

474
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:35,560
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

475
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:36,600
Yeah.

476
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:39,720
I'm just really, really concerned
about how much black we're getting.

477
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:43,475
So, if we were
to just take another one out?

478
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:45,360
Maybe that?

479
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,760
Let me see it.

480
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,400
Let me just see it.

481
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,500
Whose is that?

482
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:06,200
Something got snapped off here.

483
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,160
Which one went?
That's the guess.

484
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:11,575
Oh, yes, of course,
the other black one.

485
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:13,920
Those poor goddamn Rodartes.

486
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:16,020
I know. They're out.

487
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:19,540
Rubber's not a texture?

488
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,240
And leather's definitely--
- We ordered it.

489
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,680
We order all the prints, so...

490
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:25,040
Oh, yeah,
I've heard that story.

491
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:27,140
Yeah.

492
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,520
But it's such
a great picture, that.

493
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:32,680
Anna actually liked it as a picture.

494
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,280
She thought it wasn't texture.

495
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,380
It is texture.

496
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:49,630
Let's add the waist seam now then.

497
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:54,660
Do we need pockets?

498
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:05,780
So, this one, is it not around?

499
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,820
Yes, it is actually.

500
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,840
I personally would not
put this one in the show.

501
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:34,190
The other things you've shown us
are more exciting.

502
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:40,440
You need to have
a hundred there, no?

503
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:45,640
Grace is very good at that.
Go on, Grace.

504
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:46,680
Slash and burn.

505
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:51,880
No, Anna's, but I don't think
you could take Anna's slashing.

506
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:11,820
Thakoon. He's really good.

507
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:26,220
See, now it's beautiful.

508
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,940
Now it's really pretty.

509
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,980
This is good.

510
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,460
So, for the brooch.

511
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,080
Lanvin.

512
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:43,120
We have this.
- From Balenciaga.

513
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:45,220
I think it's cool.

514
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:47,440
Looks like a neck brace.

515
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:49,360
At first we thought
maybe it was a scarf.

516
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,460
It's a neck brace.

517
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:59,625
I moved on.
I'm onto twenties now.

518
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,480
Twenties is something that...

519
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:05,840
Well, really the inspiration
was John Galliano's show.

520
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:09,595
He was inspired by
the photographer Brassai,

521
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:12,880
who was a photographer
from the twenties.

522
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:15,360
Shoes, I'm very desperate for.

523
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:20,645
It just has to be something
that slightly evokes the twenties.

524
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:22,480
What has she got? Well.

525
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:24,920
You have to have that fashion story,
you know,

526
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:28,080
spots are in or stripes
or full skirts...

527
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:30,760
...or straight skirts
or whatever it is.

528
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:32,280
But I've tried
to make that secondary.

529
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:34,960
We build a fantasy
around the girl...

530
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:38,520
...and what she's doing,
what she's thinking, who she is.

531
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:40,680
But there, you know.
- Yeah, that.

532
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:43,560
But, of course, what's
so genius about that is that...

533
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:45,440
...she has big, fat legs
and things.

534
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:46,440
I love that.

535
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:48,120
It's a reference picture as well.

536
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,220
They're so beautiful.

537
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:53,240
Are they coming
for the run-through, please?

538
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:55,920
That was just Anna's office.
She has an 11:00 appointment.

539
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:56,920
So what does that mean?

540
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,440
It's 10 till 11:00 right now.

541
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:01,855
So she wants to see me before?
- Mm-hmm.

542
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,440
Virginia.
- Yeah?

543
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:04,560
Anna wants to see us now...

544
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:07,840
'cause she has somewhere
to be at 11:00.

545
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,940
We're goin' in.

546
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,160
I have a ton of stuff here,

547
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:17,080
and I don't know how many doubles,
triples, singles I'm doing.

548
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:19,580
But maybe we can prioritize.

549
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,640
And you should, you know,
if you hate something,

550
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:24,360
just say I never want to see that
in the magazine.

551
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:25,440
There's two coats here.

552
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:28,345
I'm sort of undecided about them.

553
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:31,440
It is similar to
the one we did in July.

554
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:35,840
It's not because you're thinking
of the one we shot and didn't run.

555
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,280
I've shot them twice,

556
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,440
but we have not had them
in the magazine.

557
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:40,600
The coat didn't run.

558
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:43,560
Anyway, there's
all these little dresses.

559
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:45,600
And then this little coat.

560
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:48,560
I love
all these little evening things.

561
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:50,440
Let's remove the coat.

562
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:52,920
I have to have
a little freedom to play around.

563
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:55,440
Grace, I mean, there's
a lot of wearable things in this,

564
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:58,000
and I want this
to be more wearable than not.

565
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:00,160
I started working
for American Vogue...

566
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,720
...the same day as Anna did.

567
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:05,645
I think we understand each other,
pretty much.

568
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:08,720
Just through
living together for twenty years.

569
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:11,340
She knows I'm stubborn.

570
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:12,440
I know she's stubborn,

571
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:15,820
and I know
when to stop pushing her.

572
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,920
She doesn't know
when to stop pushing me.

573
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,720
Is it odd just having one fur?

574
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:23,280
Should we have one other thing
that has a fur?

575
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,720
I just think it's odd to have one.

576
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:27,280
I mean, maybe you're
going to do a fur hat or--

577
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:28,800
I think it's sort of strange
to have a whole shoot--

578
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,800
I'm trying to make
as many different looks as possible.

579
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:31,880
Yeah, but I think
you need one more.

580
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:33,000
Otherwise,
you're gonna get bored.

581
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,960
Well, I would take that out.

582
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:38,000
And then these are all out,
is that right?

583
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,100
No.

584
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:42,460
These are beautiful.

585
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:45,040
Don't throw those out.
They're beautiful.

586
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,280
And I don't think
we should do this.

587
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:48,160
This one from Resort, right?

588
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:49,840
Yeah, it's so perfect.

589
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,640
I know, Grace. It's going
in the stores in November.

590
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:54,715
You can do it
in the November issue.

591
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:04,720
How can she think
of leaving these out?

592
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:06,800
I know. I love those.
- That was unbelievable.

593
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,720
But I'm not leaving them out.

594
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:10,200
They're so cute.

595
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,980
Yeah, they are. And perfect.

596
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:17,880
And what is this thing about we need
a fur coat to match that one?

597
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,440
Or a fur hat.

598
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:22,200
Oh, please. I mean, now, look.
What's this?

599
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:25,360
And she's thrown it out.
This is fur.

600
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,900
This is fur. This is fur.

601
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:35,720
That's the craziest thing
I've heard.

602
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:50,640
These are
all the September issues...

603
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:51,640
Those are all
the September issues...

604
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:53,280
...that your mother...
- has done.

605
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:56,300
She had a lot of her old issues.

606
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:59,160
And then one time,
I came in here and looked...

607
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:02,640
...and saw that she didn't have
everything that she'd ever done.

608
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:04,160
And I just thought
it would be nice for her.

609
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:06,640
So now she's got everything.

610
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:09,840
I remember that.

611
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:11,280
That was controversial.

612
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:12,560
That was controversial.

613
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:14,920
Putting a black girl
on the September cover was...

614
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:18,840
...for my first one,
that was considered questionable.

615
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:21,120
This got us a lot of attention,
fur on the cover.

616
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:23,000
This is
the death-warmed-up cover.

617
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:27,380
This one's really cute,
because they're puppies.

618
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:29,420
They look so pale.

619
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:33,880
I certainly read British Vogue
when I was fourteen, fifteen.

620
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:36,400
This is the one you hated.
- Yes.

621
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,360
My American grandmother
used to send me Seventeen.

622
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:41,680
That was a very high point
of my childhood every month.

623
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:43,520
Oh, right, Gwyneth.

624
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:46,765
This was when we
moved in celebrities.

625
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:50,080
So we've gotta decide
between these two.

626
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,080
Which one?

627
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,600
I like the color on that.
- You do?

628
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,600
But I like the dress
on the other one.

629
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:58,240
And then the other thing
I wanted to show you, darling, was--

630
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:01,480
What do you think?
That's got your look.

631
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:04,640
Her hair is in her face in that one.

632
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:09,840
You like that one?

633
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:12,150
One of these.
- Okay, good.

634
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:15,360
Do you think you'd ever work
at the magazine with your mom?

635
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:17,460
No.

636
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:19,600
I think I'm gonna go
to law school.

637
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,820
So probably not.

638
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,880
But I don't know.

639
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:28,040
I'm gonna get through college first.

640
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,240
Sorry, Mommy.

641
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:32,720
Well, early days. We'll see.

642
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,560
I really don't
want to work in fashion.

643
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:39,165
It's just not for me.
I really respect her, obviously.

644
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:42,740
But it's a really weird industry
to me,

645
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:44,865
and it's just not for me.

646
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,480
She wants me to be an editor.

647
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:49,680
I don't wanna put it down,
but it's...

648
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:52,200
I would never want
to take it too seriously.

649
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:55,360
Some of the people in there
act like fashion is life.

650
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,940
And it's just...

651
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:59,920
It's really amusing,
and you can make fun of them.

652
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:02,160
But for that to be your career,
it's just like...

653
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:05,745
There are other things
out there, I think.

654
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:14,200
Isabel.

655
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,720
Let's take a look
at your Resort collection.

656
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,360
They're very clean and crisp.

657
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:21,240
Almost--this is a compliment--
institutional, clinical.

658
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:22,720
You got it.
- Clinical.

659
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,120
Andre...

660
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:26,480
Andre's having a great time
with lsabel today.

661
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:28,120
Fabulous time.

662
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:30,600
Has all these ideas of still lifes
and things that we can do,

663
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:32,360
so we're doing all that.

664
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:33,360
You make sunglasses, too?
- Yeah.

665
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,400
Upside down.

666
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,120
Look at my tape. Exactly.

667
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,360
Upside down.

668
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:39,460
You have such an eye.

669
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:44,490
Make sure you feature the bag.

670
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:57,330
I like that a lot.
- Yeah, I really do.

671
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:02,920
Nice block.

672
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:05,020
Beautiful.

673
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:10,580
This is it?

674
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:18,160
Are they sending more to us,
or is this kind of it?

675
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:20,555
These are all they gave me.

676
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:27,360
Somehow, you know,
little dark wigs we've seen quite often,

677
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:30,880
so you have to find another way
to do a twenties.

678
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,980
Go like that.

679
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:39,700
The girls
were wonderful, and...

680
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:43,880
...they all seemed
to work perfectly.

681
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:47,660
I hope it looks
as good as I think it does.

682
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:55,700
We've done them
in a very soft color.

683
00:36:56,900 --> 00:37:00,380
It's almost
like old film that's faded.

684
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:05,640
I love when it goes soft and
even sometimes if there's movement,

685
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:07,240
there's a little blur on things.

686
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:09,740
But I don't know.

687
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:11,880
Everybody seems
to like things pin-sharp these days.

688
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,980
I think it's a shame.

689
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:26,200
I hope it's okay.
- I think this looks great.

690
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,280
Is that this week?

691
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:28,280
This was this morning.

692
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,280
This morning?

693
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:30,760
I mean, I knew
that they were doing that,

694
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:31,800
but I didn't know...

695
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:32,880
That that would be on the cover.

696
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:34,520
Right. It's kind of exciting.

697
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:37,200
I guess I would just
start at the beginning...

698
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:40,020
...with when The Gap
came to you.

699
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:42,560
It was Vogue that called
and said that, you know,

700
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:46,320
we are working with The Gap
this coming-up year,

701
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:48,400
and we want to launch
the partnership...

702
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:53,090
...with this concept
of reworking the white shirt idea.

703
00:37:58,740 --> 00:37:59,600
Congrats.

704
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,680
Thank you.
- Your face is everywhere.

705
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:02,800
How are you?
It's good to see you.

706
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:03,760
It's amazing.

707
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:05,760
Amazing. So proud of you.
It's so nice.

708
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:07,860
Hi, Anna, how are you?

709
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:10,400
So, I told you
I'd get you The Gap.

710
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,960
I know, I know.
You got me a huge thing,

711
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:14,360
which is great.
Thank you so much.

712
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:15,440
It's so funny.
I was thinking...

713
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:17,280
...about our conversation
all those months ago.

714
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:21,800
I know. I didn't realize it was gonna
turn into such a big deal.

715
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,200
Have you had a good response?

716
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,240
Yes. I think
they were sold out online.

717
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:26,240
Really?
- Yeah.

718
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:28,340
Great. Sorry.

719
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:50,640
So...

720
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:53,400
...this is what we shot
the other day.

721
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,280
It was really divine.

722
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:58,000
This is all Galliano,
who was the inspiration...

723
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,960
...and the start of the whole story.

724
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:03,460
But I completely fell in love
with these.

725
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:06,640
This is Coco.

726
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:09,040
She was doing the Charleston
here on the bar,

727
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:13,135
nearly fell off,
but I think that's kinda great.

728
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:21,180
Excuse me.
- Oh, sure.

729
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:24,560
We're gonna try to print these out
again brighter.

730
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:25,560
Okay.

731
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:28,720
This one is a little unnecessary.
- I know. It's another story.

732
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:30,640
Don't you think?
Too much.

733
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:33,560
It is. It 's all that posing,
in different kind of a set almost.

734
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:35,440
Yeah. But the others look fine.

735
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,720
But do you agree?
- Yeah.

736
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:38,820
It looks fake.

737
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,880
I think you have
more personality out of these...

738
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:44,360
...than you do on that also.

739
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:46,560
And there's plenty
of Galliano, so...

740
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:48,660
Yes.

741
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:49,800
No, they're fun.

742
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:51,760
Anna, this one's again,
the group.

743
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:54,800
But maybe if it's more in the middle,
it might work.

744
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,400
We'll see.
- All right.

745
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,840
How many are there?

746
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:58,840
Twenty-two.

747
00:39:58,940 --> 00:39:59,880
Let me give you
the right number.

748
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:02,040
They have a sort of haze
over them, too.

749
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:03,760
I have to find out how much--

750
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:06,480
I'm gonna go check and see
how much of that is the Xerox.

751
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:09,480
I need to print out the beauty
better for sure.

752
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:11,920
And then try to print this out
better too if you can.

753
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:14,315
Let's see if that helps it.

754
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:23,720
Well, look.
I think it's 'cause on the screen,

755
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:24,760
there's a little bit more color.

756
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:27,480
'Cause even in the beauty,
that Meisel did, it's everything.

757
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:30,720
I think
it's just the printer right now.

758
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:32,600
It's the printer right now.

759
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,000
They're meant to be soft.

760
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,160
They're meant to be.

761
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:36,160
That's the point.

762
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:37,400
But the colors
are not like this, though.

763
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,200
Like this. No, they are.

764
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:41,120
They're too flat to be like that.

765
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:42,120
I mean, they're meant to be.

766
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:44,920
They're not supposed
to be bright, you know, like this.

767
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:47,400
They're not all like that.
- No, I know that.

768
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:50,840
So don't try
because you won't get anywhere.

769
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:52,400
I mean, you probably will,

770
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,680
'cause you can
probably pump them up,

771
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:54,760
but it's really a shame.

772
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:55,760
Is this out?

773
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:58,020
Maybe.
- Are you kidding?

774
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:59,240
No.
- Why?

775
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:03,280
Because she doesn't feel it goes
with the rest of the story so much.

776
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:05,040
Wait and see.
This is early yet.

777
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:07,760
We have the whole issue
to put together.

778
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:09,440
I don't get why it wouldn't go in.

779
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:12,420
That's all Galliano,

780
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:13,800
which is the point of the thing.

781
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,280
You've got a few more.

782
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:16,360
You've got a few more in there.

783
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:17,560
Yeah.

784
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:19,740
I love this.

785
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:21,780
It's wonderful, this.

786
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:26,580
It's astounding.

787
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:31,880
No, they're supposed
to be soft like that.

788
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:33,280
They're supposed to be backlit.

789
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:34,680
It's maybe all the things
she doesn't like,

790
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:36,800
but that's
what they're supposed to be.

791
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,440
No, it's great.

792
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:40,540
It's really nice.

793
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:43,745
Thanks. I'll talk to her.

794
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:52,120
Is this the run-through for Sienna?

795
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:53,200
This is Sienna coming up.

796
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:54,280
So I don't have to be there
for that one.

797
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:55,920
Well, it's a cover.

798
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:59,250
I'll go to it, sure.
Just call me when.

799
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:08,100
Sorry about this.

800
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:15,200
This is like a girly heaven.

801
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:17,440
Holy crap.
- Oh, my God.

802
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:18,800
Is that the Marchesa line?

803
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:21,110
Oh, my God.
- It's amazing.

804
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,500
That's amazing.

805
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:26,575
Oh, my God.
- Is that wings? No.

806
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:28,400
It's Nina Ricci.

807
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:32,960
I don't understand how everyone
sort of collectively does--

808
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:37,055
Yeah. I mean,
it's the September issue of Vogue.

809
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:40,580
Hi, guys.
- Hi. How are you?

810
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:41,560
I'm good.

811
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:43,920
Hello. Hi.
This is Savannah, my sis.

812
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:45,520
Hi, I'm Anna. How are you?

813
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:46,560
Thank you for coming.

814
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:47,600
Do you wanna try that?

815
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:49,600
It looks cheap to me.
Okay, put it back.

816
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:52,500
That's quite ridiculous.

817
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:55,760
The evolution for Vogue
to putting celebrities on its covers...

818
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:57,240
...has been because of Anna.

819
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:59,000
She was ahead of the curve...

820
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:03,350
...to appreciate the fact
that celebrity culture...

821
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:05,540
...became overwhelming.

822
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:07,400
Am I supposed to pose
in this bit?

823
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,360
No, darling.
- I don't like it.

824
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:12,320
What Vogue did
and what the supermodels did...

825
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:13,920
...in the pages of Vogue
is that they trained...

826
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:18,480
...a generation of celebrities
to want to be supermodels.

827
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:21,680
Actresses started believing that fashion
was a seamless part of life...

828
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:26,370
...and a seamless part of celebrity,
and that was fine.

829
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:32,120
Oh, my goodness.

830
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:34,220
It's amazing.

831
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:37,560
Really no pasta.
I can't bear going to Rome...

832
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:40,600
...and not being able to have pasta.

833
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:41,840
That's incredible.

834
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:43,760
It is. You look amazing in that.

835
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:46,480
This is amazing.
I thought it was in Paris.

836
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:47,960
It's amazing.

837
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:50,040
And the rest of the shoot
is just brilliant, Grace.

838
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:52,680
Do mention it to Anna
because she's killed half of it.

839
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:54,640
It's just beautiful.
It is beautiful.

840
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:57,630
She took out
the two best pictures.

841
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:01,040
Tonne, do you want
to talk to the hair stuff,

842
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:02,840
or do you want to do
that another time?

843
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:04,400
You know what?
I just wanted to show you this.

844
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,500
This was...

845
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:09,520
...what we looked up,
which I loved.

846
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:10,640
It's divine, isn't it?

847
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:12,120
My hair's too thick to do it with.

848
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:14,000
You're great in short hair.

849
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:16,380
You think better?
Do you?

850
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:17,720
I do.

851
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:20,480
I have a survey
of every hairstyle you've had...

852
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:22,960
...for my board.
I'm serious.

853
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:27,820
The shoot is centered
around a weekend in Rome.

854
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:30,000
She's gonna go around town...

855
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:32,400
...and I have to storyboard
that, literally.

856
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:35,000
Because this
is gonna be highly produced.

857
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:37,735
Otherwise, it's gonna be chaos.

858
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:41,660
Feathers.

859
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:50,320
I'm going to Europe today.

860
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:52,460
Rome, Paris, and London.

861
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:54,640
What time are we leaving
on Wednesday?

862
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:56,720
I'm emailing your itinerary.

863
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:57,840
Just tell me a time.

864
00:44:57,940 --> 00:44:59,480
Have we organized
where they would...

865
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:00,840
...bring these dresses in Rome?

866
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:02,940
No.

867
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:05,360
It's a problem when yours
are the first pictures in.

868
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:08,080
'Cause people
get bored with them.

869
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:11,200
So she's gonna love
the Rome pictures,

870
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:15,720
because they'll come straight in,
and they'll go straight to press.

871
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:19,000
If Sienna gets sick and
doesn't turn up in Rome maybe,

872
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:22,245
maybe all the pictures
will come back.

873
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:29,935
They'll probably find another celebrity
to take her place, I don't know.

874
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:37,680
So, shall we not talk
about feathers anymore?

875
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:40,080
The feather discussion is over.

876
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:42,960
Is there anything
we need to talk about for December,

877
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:45,160
or does that just wait
till we come back?

878
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:47,380
I think we're done.

879
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:52,920
Grace, I'm leaving soon.
Do you need me for anything?

880
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:56,925
Well, yeah, we have,
you know, like...

881
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:02,875
The budget is a problem,
because, you know--

882
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:06,480
It's not fine.
It's not that simple.

883
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:08,120
Well, you need to talk with her
because she has the figures.

884
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:10,520
I know, but it's a hell
of a lot of work to put together,

885
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:14,640
which I don't want to do
if you have a limited budget.

886
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:17,240
So I can't really find out
what the limit is...

887
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:20,060
'cause the limit keeps changing.

888
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:24,720
I'm in a really foul mood,

889
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:26,480
because they've killed
a lot of the spread...

890
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:28,620
...of my twenties story.

891
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:30,240
And they're about to kill
another one.

892
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:32,200
And they're all lying
to me about it,

893
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:36,040
including Danko,
who I thought was my friend.

894
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:39,600
And you just sit here
and everything is killed.

895
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:42,250
It's, like, incredibly boring.

896
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:47,320
And I love to talk money
in front of you guys with Anna...

897
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:49,740
'cause it drives her crazy.

898
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:53,960
It's a sure way
to get the budget up.

899
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:57,680
I don't like this.

900
00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:00,670
No. Then I'll rid you
of this, too.

901
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:06,600
No, it's just that that's
not a good place for that to go.

902
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:08,700
Oh, okay.

903
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:14,350
This is too long, Charlie.
- Still.

904
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:17,520
All right, we'll take it down.

905
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:20,280
It's easy to take down then,
if that's the case.

906
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:23,440
Yes, I'll have him do it right away.

907
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:29,600
Didier?

908
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:31,700
I'm fine. How are you?

909
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:34,400
I think that it's
actually going to be a wig, Didier,

910
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:37,390
so you're gonna
need time to, yeah.

911
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:41,200
Her hair is just completely lackluster,
and she's growing it out.

912
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:43,120
She won't cut it.
You know, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

913
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:46,040
It might be just easier to do a wig.

914
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:47,040
Do you need this?

915
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:51,560
And your tickets are in the July,
your 'up' envelope.

916
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:54,780
The money is in the bag.

917
00:47:55,420 --> 00:47:57,800
See you guys in Europe. Bye.

918
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:27,120
Well, I think we
have to discuss things.

919
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:29,880
And it's gonna be around
until the next...

920
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:33,200
Until Tonne's pictures come in.
- She's come back.

921
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:34,320
That's for next month.

922
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:36,885
No, Sienna is not next month.

923
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:40,400
But we're not going to really do
the issue until Anna gets back.

924
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,120
We're just putting
all these things up.

925
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:44,320
Well, no,
you're taking them all down.

926
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:46,970
You're taking everything down.

927
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:49,040
They took two more out,

928
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:52,370
and there's question marks
on two more.

929
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:54,885
So it's been whittled down...

930
00:48:57,140 --> 00:48:59,140
...and I'm furious.

931
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:04,665
They've probably thrown out
$50,000 worth of work.

932
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:08,680
I care very much about what I do.

933
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:12,775
I do, or I wouldn't be
still doing it, you know.

934
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:18,135
But it gets harder and harder
to see it just thrown out.

935
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:30,680
And it's very hard to go
onto the next thing.

936
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:11,980
How are you, Grace?

937
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:14,340
Hi, how are you?

938
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:25,520
Did they give you the message
about Chanel?

939
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:28,850
That you're going
this afternoon? Yeah.

940
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:50,920
Jean Paul.

941
00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:53,360
How are you, Anna?
Nice to see you.

942
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:54,840
Nice to see you, too.

943
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:58,085
Pleasure to see you.
Welcome to Paris.

944
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:02,720
Maybe I want,
the thing is that my clothes--

945
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:05,560
Nothing's ready.
You're gonna say the usual story.

946
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:10,250
Bon. But, but, but, but
we are still going to show you.

947
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:13,280
I show you
the only one you can see. Coco?

948
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:15,380
Voila.

949
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:26,660
Wow.

950
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:43,040
Well, you know,
I'm doing a shoot here in Paris.

951
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:46,120
I'm looking, 'cause I always
come to the Couture, almost always.

952
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:50,320
I've been actually for twenty years
at American Vogue...

953
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:52,240
...and twenty years
before that on British Vogue...

954
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:54,080
...and a few years before that
when I was modeling.

955
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:55,720
So I've been coming
for a long time.

956
00:51:55,820 --> 00:52:00,835
Obviously, ostensibly, I'm there
to find something to shoot.

957
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:04,465
But I always mark
too many things.

958
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:10,185
Anna says, 'Don't be silly.
We can't do that one.'

959
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:07,000
Hi, darling.

960
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:08,000
How are you?

961
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:10,100
I'm good, and you?

962
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:10,960
Did you see the match last--

963
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:13,360
My God, you look amazing
for this room.

964
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:14,440
Right. I didn't think.

965
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:16,040
Did you see Roger's match
yesterday?

966
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:18,600
He won. No, I didn't see it,
but I heard he won.

967
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:21,620
So, we go to Sienna.

968
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:26,320
So a schedule, a rough schedule
I've done with Tonne.

969
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:29,000
Basically, I want to create a film,
you know.

970
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:31,160
A mixture of Fellini
meets Visconti meets...

971
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:32,200
Oh, right.

972
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:33,400
Almost like cinema--
- 'Roman Holiday.'

973
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:35,580
Yeah. Very cinematic.

974
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:37,560
I think that I would like to try
and do a--

975
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:39,760
But the charming side
of ltalian film,

976
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:41,240
rather than the broody,
moody side.

977
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:42,760
Of course,
but look how beautiful,

978
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:45,200
her with the people
in the background.

979
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:48,640
I mean, I want things
that are quite spectacular.

980
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:53,680
And I want to do something to do
with the Vespas in St. Peter's Square.

981
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:58,200
And then I wanted something
with horses and soldiers.

982
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:00,200
I mean,
there is a lot of white.

983
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:03,040
Like, I love that.
The feeling of this white.

984
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:05,640
There's the pastry shop,
which is all white.

985
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:07,040
I mean, there's a lot of white.

986
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:10,440
I don't know why I keep on looking
at things that are white.

987
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:12,200
You know, the white horses.

988
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:14,400
Because I think that
that would be good use for this.

989
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:15,840
And then I love this idea...

990
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:18,280
...of putting the horse
in odd places as well.

991
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:22,880
But I just don't want that to be
the whole thrust of the story.

992
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:26,920
Now let's talk about her, because
her hair is not looking its best.

993
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:29,600
We had thought
of putting a wig on her.

994
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:30,920
Like a little blond wig.
- Well, I think that's a great idea.

995
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:33,640
A really graphic one.
Yeah, blond.

996
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:37,940
My advice, since
we're going to be short on time,

997
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:40,860
is if we decide on a look...

998
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:43,800
...and just stay with it because
you don't wanna waste hours.

999
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:46,120
Oh, no. I would do a look,
and that's her look.

1000
00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:47,920
Great.
I'm really excited about this.

1001
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:49,520
This is gonna be the biggest one
in our history.

1002
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:50,760
It is an amazing room, no?

1003
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:52,360
Incredible.
You should have a party here.

1004
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:54,000
What, the September one
is gonna be the--

1005
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:55,440
What, how many pages,
like 10,000?

1006
00:54:55,540 --> 00:54:57,960
I don't know yet
but it's the biggest in our history, so.

1007
00:54:58,060 --> 00:54:59,920
Really?
- Yep. So we're excited.

1008
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:02,655
I should have a party here, no?

1009
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:33,395
Paris is so beautiful.
It really is.

1010
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:37,680
I never dreamt to be a model...

1011
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:40,960
...or never, never dreamt
to be a fashion editor.

1012
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:44,715
But I just loved
the pages and the pictures.

1013
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:49,685
In my early years
as a fashion editor,

1014
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:52,000
I worked with Norman Parkinson,

1015
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:54,905
who was
a really big photographer.

1016
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:59,340
And he taught me
to always keep your eyes open,

1017
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:01,760
you know, never to go to sleep
in the car or anything like that.

1018
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:04,680
Keep watching, because
whatever you see out the window...

1019
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:07,780
...or wherever,
it can inspire you.

1020
00:56:47,540 --> 00:56:49,540
It is amazing.

1021
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:53,980
It's sort of strange
to think how old it is.

1022
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:05,900
It's beautiful.

1023
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:09,320
I think I got left behind somewhere,

1024
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:11,800
'cause I'm still a romantic.

1025
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:17,840
You have to go charging ahead.

1026
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:19,940
You can't stay behind.

1027
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:28,740
She looks good.
- Good.

1028
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:35,600
Move her head just a tiny bit forward
so you get like an 's.'

1029
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:37,600
Good. That's the one. Good.

1030
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:39,700
Oh, wow.

1031
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:45,840
Anna? How are you?

1032
00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:47,360
We're doing very well.

1033
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:49,720
I'm sitting here
with Mario and everybody.

1034
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:50,720
Sienna's here.

1035
00:57:50,820 --> 00:57:52,920
We're doing a wig.
Everything's great.

1036
00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:54,800
Let's divide our story ideas.

1037
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:58,555
Let's do four visual locations.
Let's say...

1038
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:00,680
That's pretty spectacular,
don't you think?

1039
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:02,960
I mean, look.
You've got the Coliseum.

1040
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:04,640
It is beautiful.
- It's beautiful.

1041
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:06,360
I think we don't need it.

1042
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:09,760
Got beautiful open shade light.
I mean, it's so pretty.

1043
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:14,110
That is what I'm wondering,
whether we want pretty.

1044
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:18,160
I find I've done this hair,
like, really- -

1045
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:20,440
I would love something new.
A new proposition.

1046
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:22,540
Yeah.

1047
00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:25,280
We tried the wig,
and it did not work.

1048
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:26,440
And we moved on.

1049
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:28,600
And we moved on
in the right direction, I think.

1050
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:31,000
There, wow. Stay there.
Don't move.

1051
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:32,760
This is your face. Don't move.

1052
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:34,800
This is really beautiful, no?

1053
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:38,895
I like that freshness.
It's the September cover.

1054
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:40,900
Come, Sienna. Come.

1055
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:45,000
Okay, again.

1056
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:47,100
Go, go, go, go.

1057
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:50,180
And again.

1058
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:53,780
Come forward. Come forward.
Go there.

1059
00:58:55,620 --> 00:58:58,680
That's quite a view.
Isn't it, Mario?

1060
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:07,560
I can certainly
get rid of the head thing.

1061
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:08,880
Do you wanna get rid
of the head thing?

1062
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:11,275
Maybe. Maybe it's not good.

1063
00:59:16,940 --> 00:59:18,920
Grace, thanks for the pie.

1064
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:20,320
I just don't know
if I should eat that...

1065
00:59:20,420 --> 00:59:21,480
'cause the corsets are so tight.

1066
00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:25,120
That's not going to make
a difference, Raquel.

1067
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:27,220
Hello.

1068
00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:31,360
There.

1069
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:33,500
Fantastico.

1070
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:35,920
Can you breathe?
Are you all right?

1071
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:38,020
Yeah.

1072
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:40,160
That's incredible.

1073
00:59:40,260 --> 00:59:41,520
That's beautiful.

1074
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:43,400
And the expression here
is very lovely.

1075
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:47,200
Just play with your hands
a little, Raquel, for me.

1076
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:48,720
Oh, wow.

1077
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:50,000
That's beautiful.
- It ain't bad.

1078
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:51,440
I think you got it.
- Okay.

1079
00:59:51,540 --> 00:59:54,685
Let's go. Thanks.
- Well done, Raquel.

1080
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:28,120
Let's go, Andre, left, left.

1081
01:00:30,780 --> 01:00:35,370
Ms. Wintour inaugurated me
into health by intervention.

1082
01:00:35,380 --> 01:00:38,120
She saved my life, I guess,
in the long-term...

1083
01:00:38,220 --> 01:00:40,040
...because she intervened
about three years ago...

1084
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:42,160
...that I got to lose the weight.

1085
01:00:42,260 --> 01:00:45,120
So, naturally,
what Ms. Wintour says goes.

1086
01:00:45,220 --> 01:00:46,600
So I took up tennis.

1087
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:48,880
Over your shoulder.
Come on. Good.

1088
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:50,000
I wouldn't come
to the tennis court...

1089
01:00:50,100 --> 01:00:52,680
...in just a pair of shorts
and a tennis shirt.

1090
01:00:52,780 --> 01:00:54,640
I go to Damon Dash
for my trousers.

1091
01:00:54,740 --> 01:00:56,160
I go to Ralph Lauren
for the shirts.

1092
01:00:56,260 --> 01:00:58,640
This is my version
of a tennis watch.

1093
01:00:58,740 --> 01:01:00,640
It's a Piaget
from the sixties.

1094
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:02,120
But I would wear this
to the tennis court.

1095
01:01:02,220 --> 01:01:03,160
I would wear it all day long.

1096
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:06,120
It's all a part of the whole life
of being who I am.

1097
01:01:06,220 --> 01:01:12,085
I have to get up and approach life
with my own aesthetics about style.

1098
01:01:19,060 --> 01:01:20,840
Anna Wintour's office.

1099
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:24,440
The magazine will be
actually almost nine million up...

1100
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:25,880
...when we come out of September.

1101
01:01:25,980 --> 01:01:26,920
Wonderful.

1102
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:28,720
This is not a great-looking opener.

1103
01:01:28,820 --> 01:01:30,480
I mean,
this is a cleaner opener.

1104
01:01:30,580 --> 01:01:32,280
You know,
the girl looking at you.

1105
01:01:32,380 --> 01:01:36,160
You want to open with something
people want to read, I think.

1106
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:38,600
Do you need me, Charlie?
- Yes, the Couture's here.

1107
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:40,995
Oh, great.
What about Mario?

1108
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:45,960
Hello?

1109
01:01:46,060 --> 01:01:48,240
I love them.
They look gorgeous.

1110
01:01:48,340 --> 01:01:49,360
I've stolen them.

1111
01:01:49,460 --> 01:01:52,690
I snatched them
out of Charlie's hands.

1112
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:55,710
He went bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu.

1113
01:01:59,820 --> 01:02:04,320
Kind of, but, you know, he hates
to say until Anna's seen them...

1114
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:06,970
...in case he makes a mistake.

1115
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:14,640
A lot of wigs.

1116
01:02:14,740 --> 01:02:16,740
All through it.

1117
01:02:25,340 --> 01:02:26,960
It's fourteen pages.

1118
01:02:27,060 --> 01:02:29,060
This is pretty.

1119
01:02:35,380 --> 01:02:37,380
Beautiful.

1120
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:39,760
Well, we can wait, right?

1121
01:02:39,860 --> 01:02:40,760
Oh, yes, sure.

1122
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:44,920
This slightly hinges on what
happened with Sienna, I think.

1123
01:02:45,020 --> 01:02:48,760
And Grace wasn't crazy
about that one anyway.

1124
01:02:50,740 --> 01:02:52,400
Hi.

1125
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:54,760
I know it, Brian just told me.

1126
01:02:54,860 --> 01:02:56,240
It's coming out now.

1127
01:02:56,340 --> 01:02:59,880
So as soon as I look at it--
Maybe I'll call you right back.

1128
01:02:59,980 --> 01:03:01,040
Okay, thanks a lot, Mario.

1129
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:02,480
I need these printed
out right away.

1130
01:03:02,580 --> 01:03:05,640
Sure. Yeah, it's printing now, but--

1131
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:09,160
So this is what Mario sent?

1132
01:03:09,260 --> 01:03:11,895
This is what he just sent, yes.

1133
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:15,400
But did he send the cover?

1134
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:16,560
No.
- Okay.

1135
01:03:16,660 --> 01:03:19,550
It's taking him a while
to do that.

1136
01:03:25,060 --> 01:03:26,080
That's it?
- Yes.

1137
01:03:26,180 --> 01:03:27,680
That's it for the clothes?

1138
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:29,600
That's all I've gotten.
That's all he said.

1139
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:31,320
Can you get Tonne in here?

1140
01:03:31,420 --> 01:03:33,080
I don't know if she's in yet.
She wasn't in before.

1141
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:34,920
Let me see if she's back.

1142
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:37,800
Not yet. Her assistant's
calling her to find out.

1143
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:39,640
Could we ask her assistant...

1144
01:03:39,740 --> 01:03:43,650
...to see how many pictures
here we're missing?

1145
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:45,800
This is all he sent.

1146
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:47,900
Can I see lvan, please?

1147
01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:51,280
And I need Tonne's assistant
or...Hi.

1148
01:03:51,380 --> 01:03:53,240
Did he say this was,
there's more coming...

1149
01:03:53,340 --> 01:03:55,660
...or there's nothing else?

1150
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:56,600
No, this, I think is the story.

1151
01:03:56,700 --> 01:03:58,560
But I'll go back to them
and just double-check.

1152
01:03:58,660 --> 01:03:59,680
As I understand it,
this is everything.

1153
01:03:59,780 --> 01:04:04,540
Can we get Tonne's assistant
or Virginia in here, please?

1154
01:04:06,860 --> 01:04:08,800
Tonne, I'm sorry, I'm losing you.

1155
01:04:08,900 --> 01:04:11,840
I thought we were
gonna have more clothes.

1156
01:04:11,940 --> 01:04:12,840
Okay, Mario.

1157
01:04:12,940 --> 01:04:15,920
I'd like to see the rest of the film
as soon as possible.

1158
01:04:16,020 --> 01:04:17,320
You understand?

1159
01:04:17,420 --> 01:04:19,970
But I didn't get the Coliseum.

1160
01:04:20,780 --> 01:04:21,680
Right.

1161
01:04:21,780 --> 01:04:22,760
I don't think that's it.

1162
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:26,200
I think the thing is
is the whole look is everything.

1163
01:04:26,300 --> 01:04:28,300
Truthfully.

1164
01:04:30,420 --> 01:04:31,360
But I don't know
if we even need to reshoot.

1165
01:04:31,460 --> 01:04:34,800
But it's something
that's being talked about.

1166
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:37,960
So I just want to put it
in your ear.

1167
01:04:39,340 --> 01:04:42,360
I just finished talking to Mario.
No other Nina Ricci.

1168
01:04:42,460 --> 01:04:43,360
That was it.

1169
01:04:43,460 --> 01:04:44,400
That was it.
- They didn't do it for me?

1170
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:45,400
No. And they didn't--

1171
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:48,280
He says he didn't do
the Coliseum dress.

1172
01:04:48,380 --> 01:04:50,040
He says he didn't like it,
so they didn't do it.

1173
01:04:50,140 --> 01:04:52,140
Okay.

1174
01:04:52,140 --> 01:04:54,080
I just finished talking to Mario.

1175
01:04:54,180 --> 01:04:57,080
He says there is nothing
on the dress at the Coliseum.

1176
01:04:57,180 --> 01:04:59,320
Well, he didn't like it.
He really couldn't.

1177
01:04:59,420 --> 01:05:01,920
He says he didn't like it,
so he never really did it, he said,

1178
01:05:02,020 --> 01:05:03,200
which I had to tell her.

1179
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:04,640
You know, it's digital.
- I know.

1180
01:05:04,740 --> 01:05:06,280
He did something,
but he never got an image...

1181
01:05:06,380 --> 01:05:07,800
...that he wanted to hold onto.
- Right.

1182
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:09,560
You know, I understand that,
you know,

1183
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:11,440
she needs a few more dresses...

1184
01:05:11,540 --> 01:05:13,200
...but, you know...

1185
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:14,160
...you get what you get.

1186
01:05:14,260 --> 01:05:15,800
I'm concerned a little
'cause I'm not positive...

1187
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:16,880
...of the cover at the moment.

1188
01:05:16,980 --> 01:05:19,920
The one he's chosen, she's
kind of tough-looking in the face.

1189
01:05:20,020 --> 01:05:23,250
That's not a face for a cover.
- Right.

1190
01:05:23,300 --> 01:05:24,200
See this.

1191
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:26,000
This...It can't be that.

1192
01:05:26,100 --> 01:05:27,640
I think there could be
definitely be something there.

1193
01:05:27,740 --> 01:05:28,960
That's what I think.

1194
01:05:29,060 --> 01:05:31,600
So I think
that's pretty ravishing.

1195
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:33,680
Look at it now.
I've cropped in on it and turned it.

1196
01:05:33,780 --> 01:05:35,240
What does this say? Something.

1197
01:05:35,340 --> 01:05:38,860
'Like this best, but teeth.'

1198
01:05:38,900 --> 01:05:40,900
'But teeth.'

1199
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:44,100
Mario. Hi.

1200
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:46,760
I just meant to ask
if there was something there...

1201
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:50,760
...that you thought
that we could at least look at.

1202
01:05:50,860 --> 01:05:52,860
Not one?

1203
01:05:57,780 --> 01:06:00,240
Florence, could you make me
some coffee, please?

1204
01:06:00,340 --> 01:06:02,340
Thank you.

1205
01:06:10,860 --> 01:06:11,960
She has to look so conservative...

1206
01:06:12,060 --> 01:06:13,760
...because she's working
at a lawyer's office.

1207
01:06:13,860 --> 01:06:16,155
No, a judge.
- Judge. Sorry.

1208
01:06:20,820 --> 01:06:23,480
My older brother
is in charge of finding

1209
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:26,480
Iower income housing in London
for people that need it,

1210
01:06:26,580 --> 01:06:29,810
and my sister's very involved
in, uh...

1211
01:06:31,740 --> 01:06:34,480
...supporting farmers' rights
in Latin America.

1212
01:06:34,580 --> 01:06:39,170
My younger brother is
political editor of The Guardian.

1213
01:06:39,180 --> 01:06:42,155
And very successful,
very brilliant.

1214
01:06:51,180 --> 01:06:53,645
My two brothers
and my sister,

1215
01:06:55,860 --> 01:06:59,260
I think they're very amused
by what I do.

1216
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:08,500
They're amused.

1217
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:11,300
So.

1218
01:07:16,340 --> 01:07:19,060
All right.
Well, have a good day.

1219
01:07:20,260 --> 01:07:21,600
You, too.

1220
01:07:21,700 --> 01:07:23,700
Love you.

1221
01:07:51,780 --> 01:07:55,600
Amanda Lacey is a London facialist
who is a great friend of Plum's,

1222
01:07:55,700 --> 01:07:57,880
and she's got a beautiful line
of products,

1223
01:07:57,980 --> 01:07:59,720
and she's opening
a new store in London.

1224
01:07:59,820 --> 01:08:02,440
And if it's ready,
I'd love to do a little item on that.

1225
01:08:02,540 --> 01:08:06,680
And then this is a piece
about all the advancements in eyes.

1226
01:08:06,780 --> 01:08:08,120
And I think that eyes
are something...

1227
01:08:08,220 --> 01:08:09,960
...that women of all ages
think about...

1228
01:08:10,060 --> 01:08:11,720
...because their eyes start aging.

1229
01:08:11,820 --> 01:08:13,160
They're the first thing
that starts to age,

1230
01:08:13,260 --> 01:08:18,530
and I think even women in their 20s
are concerned about it, so.

1231
01:08:20,900 --> 01:08:24,240
This is the look
that Andre would prefer to have.

1232
01:08:24,340 --> 01:08:26,340
There's no alternative?

1233
01:08:27,460 --> 01:08:29,320
I said I didn't want any more...

1234
01:08:29,420 --> 01:08:30,320
Environment?
- black and white.

1235
01:08:30,420 --> 01:08:32,420
Black and white, okay.

1236
01:08:33,380 --> 01:08:34,520
Is it this one, Anna,
do you think?

1237
01:08:34,620 --> 01:08:37,160
Yeah, but I still like this one.

1238
01:08:37,260 --> 01:08:38,920
Okay, but stronger.

1239
01:08:39,020 --> 01:08:43,840
I remember when my dad retired,
and I asked him why he was leaving...

1240
01:08:43,940 --> 01:08:45,360
...because he was
obviously so passionate...

1241
01:08:45,460 --> 01:08:46,680
...about what he was doing still.

1242
01:08:46,780 --> 01:08:49,840
And he said,
'Well, I get too angry.'

1243
01:08:50,060 --> 01:08:52,080
'l find myself
getting too angry.'

1244
01:08:52,180 --> 01:08:53,280
So I do remember that,

1245
01:08:53,380 --> 01:08:56,080
because I know there are times
I get quite angry.

1246
01:08:56,180 --> 01:08:58,580
So I try and restrain that.

1247
01:08:58,620 --> 01:09:01,040
So I think when I find myself
getting really, really angry,

1248
01:09:01,140 --> 01:09:03,435
that might be time to stop.

1249
01:09:26,460 --> 01:09:29,605
Anna saw the celebrity
thing coming...

1250
01:09:29,660 --> 01:09:32,880
...way before everybody else
jumped on that bandwagon.

1251
01:09:32,980 --> 01:09:35,700
And, you know,
whilst I hated it,

1252
01:09:36,180 --> 01:09:38,320
I'm afraid
I have to admit she was right.

1253
01:09:38,420 --> 01:09:40,880
You know, you can't stay behind.

1254
01:09:40,980 --> 01:09:42,520
You have to go charging ahead.

1255
01:09:42,620 --> 01:09:43,880
And she did,

1256
01:09:43,980 --> 01:09:47,800
and the magazine is
very successful because of it.

1257
01:09:47,900 --> 01:09:50,100
I mean, whilst I'd be...

1258
01:09:50,140 --> 01:09:53,640
I wouldn't really care
if I never saw another celebrity,

1259
01:09:53,740 --> 01:09:59,010
obviously if the magazine doesn't sell,
I don't have a job, so.

1260
01:09:59,660 --> 01:10:01,660
It would be silly.

1261
01:10:06,740 --> 01:10:09,160
You know, you gotta have
something to put your work in,

1262
01:10:09,260 --> 01:10:11,385
otherwise it's not valid.

1263
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:36,980
Vogue. Good morning.

1264
01:10:38,540 --> 01:10:40,880
Has Prada gotten
this request yet or no?

1265
01:10:40,980 --> 01:10:43,615
I haven't heard back from them.

1266
01:10:46,660 --> 01:10:48,860
It's all changed.
- What?

1267
01:10:48,900 --> 01:10:50,480
It's all changed.
- What's all changed?

1268
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:53,040
The shoot we're doing this weekend
is going to be a reshoot...

1269
01:10:53,140 --> 01:10:55,200
...of the color block shoot
that Edward did.

1270
01:10:55,300 --> 01:10:56,360
What?

1271
01:10:56,460 --> 01:10:58,560
Anna killed color blocking.

1272
01:10:58,660 --> 01:11:00,560
And they wanna reshoot it
and then,

1273
01:11:00,660 --> 01:11:03,360
but, of course,
it's very urgent, so...

1274
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:05,320
I got your message.
We're already working on it.

1275
01:11:05,420 --> 01:11:07,420
Okay.
- A little while.

1276
01:11:07,780 --> 01:11:10,520
But I've gotta get all new clothes
in five minutes.

1277
01:11:10,620 --> 01:11:12,200
It's getting a little busy up here.

1278
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:13,720
There's just a bunch
on the priority rack.

1279
01:11:13,820 --> 01:11:14,920
I don't know where it came from.

1280
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:15,960
Sarah has Marc Jacobs
on her rack.

1281
01:11:16,060 --> 01:11:17,520
I'll grab that for you as well.

1282
01:11:17,620 --> 01:11:19,940
What about stuff like this?

1283
01:11:19,980 --> 01:11:21,160
That particular one was shot,

1284
01:11:21,260 --> 01:11:23,280
but, yes, in theory,
it could be color block.

1285
01:11:23,380 --> 01:11:25,920
But I shot one of these
in that same issue,

1286
01:11:26,020 --> 01:11:27,200
so that's no good.

1287
01:11:27,300 --> 01:11:28,200
And this one?

1288
01:11:28,300 --> 01:11:29,800
That's good.
That hasn't been shot.

1289
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:33,160
Have I shot that skirt?
- You shot the skirt. Yes.

1290
01:11:33,260 --> 01:11:35,320
This has to close on Thursday.
- I know.

1291
01:11:35,420 --> 01:11:37,040
And it's not gonna come in
until Wednesday?

1292
01:11:37,140 --> 01:11:38,960
Now, Laurie,
I can't do anything about it.

1293
01:11:39,060 --> 01:11:41,280
A change was made,
and I didn't even know.

1294
01:11:41,380 --> 01:11:43,440
Did I shoot this? I shot this.

1295
01:11:43,540 --> 01:11:45,360
You did.

1296
01:11:45,460 --> 01:11:47,960
There's a red coat.
- Yes. Shot.

1297
01:11:48,060 --> 01:11:50,160
Was your twenties Prada dress shot?
The red one?

1298
01:11:50,260 --> 01:11:51,440
Yeah.
- You shot it, and it was--

1299
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:53,540
And it was killed.

1300
01:11:54,780 --> 01:11:56,905
We just redid the layout.

1301
01:11:57,620 --> 01:11:59,720
I feel very excited to see...

1302
01:11:59,820 --> 01:12:03,760
...that there was a photo of mine
in the hallway.

1303
01:12:03,860 --> 01:12:05,860
Twenty years later.

1304
01:12:07,060 --> 01:12:08,560
Are we opening the issue?

1305
01:12:08,660 --> 01:12:10,700
Yes, as of now.

1306
01:12:10,740 --> 01:12:11,720
What do you mean 'as of now'?

1307
01:12:11,820 --> 01:12:13,860
Doesn't it have to ship?

1308
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:19,400
Is that all I did?

1309
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:20,400
That's all.

1310
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:24,940
I seemed to, like, sweat like mad
to get these.

1311
01:12:24,980 --> 01:12:26,360
Whatever happened to the Coliseum,
I don' t know.

1312
01:12:26,460 --> 01:12:27,800
That was the only one.

1313
01:12:27,900 --> 01:12:30,000
That didn't work,
unfortunately.

1314
01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:33,160
You know we had little time,
and I wanted to do another cover,

1315
01:12:33,260 --> 01:12:35,280
and I said, I'm not gonna
spend three hours here.

1316
01:12:35,380 --> 01:12:36,800
I would rather do a cover.

1317
01:12:36,900 --> 01:12:38,200
Do you have the covers?

1318
01:12:38,300 --> 01:12:39,440
Right here.

1319
01:12:39,540 --> 01:12:41,840
It's between these two.
We're testing both for now.

1320
01:12:41,940 --> 01:12:45,640
Do you think I should use
this body and that head?

1321
01:12:45,740 --> 01:12:47,950
Let's look, let's do this.

1322
01:12:48,500 --> 01:12:51,120
Would this be more--
- It's a better neck.

1323
01:12:51,220 --> 01:12:53,400
We have to retouch a lot of this
because it's a lot of teeth.

1324
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:54,960
It's very teethy.

1325
01:12:55,060 --> 01:12:57,600
And also there's a filling,
there's a couple of fillings there.

1326
01:12:57,700 --> 01:12:58,800
But we can fix that.

1327
01:12:58,900 --> 01:13:00,900
Of course. Absolutely.

1328
01:13:00,940 --> 01:13:04,840
I think that that is very inviting.
- When we put cover lines on there,

1329
01:13:04,940 --> 01:13:06,760
it's gonna be at you.
So that's the one.

1330
01:13:06,860 --> 01:13:08,240
But you're right.
I think that neck--

1331
01:13:08,340 --> 01:13:10,680
That shoulder is boring.
Might be more beautiful, no?

1332
01:13:10,780 --> 01:13:12,400
And I'm gonna dummy it up
that way, so.

1333
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:14,540
Okay, great.
- All right.

1334
01:13:15,700 --> 01:13:18,680
There's no color stuff left
that hasn't already been shot...

1335
01:13:18,780 --> 01:13:19,760
...that is any good, so...

1336
01:13:19,860 --> 01:13:20,760
What is it called
that you're shooting?

1337
01:13:20,860 --> 01:13:22,860
I don't know.

1338
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:27,120
I'm making it up
as I go along. Whoops.

1339
01:13:27,220 --> 01:13:29,220
And I've got two days.

1340
01:13:29,220 --> 01:13:31,600
Is this the last shoot
that we expect?

1341
01:13:31,700 --> 01:13:33,740
You'd better pray it is,

1342
01:13:33,740 --> 01:13:36,720
because otherwise
I don't know who's gonna shoot it.

1343
01:13:36,820 --> 01:13:38,560
The biggest issue of the year,
and we have to close,

1344
01:13:38,660 --> 01:13:40,955
and they're still shooting.

1345
01:13:41,780 --> 01:13:44,040
I had an idea, but I don't know
if I want to do it or not,

1346
01:13:44,140 --> 01:13:46,220
and it involves you.

1347
01:13:46,260 --> 01:13:49,280
That's why I'm asking.
Not you, Tonne.

1348
01:13:49,380 --> 01:13:51,380
My friend here.

1349
01:13:57,100 --> 01:13:59,225
How you feel today, good?

1350
01:13:59,780 --> 01:14:01,120
You feel young today?
Feel good?

1351
01:14:01,220 --> 01:14:03,220
I feel good, sir.

1352
01:14:04,980 --> 01:14:06,980
Can you jump?

1353
01:14:10,540 --> 01:14:13,685
Yeah, that's very fun.
This was great.

1354
01:14:15,860 --> 01:14:17,860
One more, okay?

1355
01:14:20,380 --> 01:14:22,380
That's great.

1356
01:14:22,420 --> 01:14:25,680
So we want her on the same page,
very close to him, like that?

1357
01:14:25,780 --> 01:14:26,680
Right.

1358
01:14:26,780 --> 01:14:28,780
Jumping, too.

1359
01:14:42,260 --> 01:14:43,320
That's good, I think.

1360
01:14:43,420 --> 01:14:46,140
She's looking right in the lens.

1361
01:14:49,460 --> 01:14:51,460
Good.

1362
01:14:56,860 --> 01:14:58,860
Here we go.

1363
01:15:07,780 --> 01:15:09,780
Awesome.

1364
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:19,645
How many times
did they make you jump?

1365
01:15:34,740 --> 01:15:35,920
I like them. They're fun.

1366
01:15:36,020 --> 01:15:38,000
I mean, we just needed
a breath of fresh air in the issue.

1367
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:40,395
Everything was quite dense.

1368
01:15:41,140 --> 01:15:45,475
They looks great.
Wearable, accessible, great props.

1369
01:15:46,660 --> 01:15:48,870
We're working on this one.

1370
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:51,200
A little bit of retouching.

1371
01:15:51,300 --> 01:15:53,160
Need to go to the gym.

1372
01:15:53,260 --> 01:15:55,260
Anna.

1373
01:15:56,340 --> 01:15:57,840
But they look great.

1374
01:15:57,940 --> 01:15:59,940
I'm glad we redid it.

1375
01:16:01,540 --> 01:16:02,440
It's Patrick?

1376
01:16:02,540 --> 01:16:03,480
Patrick, yes.

1377
01:16:03,580 --> 01:16:04,600
Great.

1378
01:16:04,700 --> 01:16:06,700
Patrick and Grace.

1379
01:16:14,580 --> 01:16:16,580
Did she like them?

1380
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:21,360
Oh, I bet.

1381
01:16:21,460 --> 01:16:23,460
Of course.

1382
01:16:29,140 --> 01:16:30,480
Due to which picture?
The jumping one?

1383
01:16:30,580 --> 01:16:32,580
Yeah.

1384
01:16:38,580 --> 01:16:41,460
No, but, you know, personally,

1385
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:44,680
I think it's better that you're not,
like, skinny, skinny.

1386
01:16:44,780 --> 01:16:48,240
To me, it much more
makes the point then...

1387
01:16:48,340 --> 01:16:52,340
...that you're real people
and not models.

1388
01:16:53,540 --> 01:16:55,920
Everybody isn't perfect
in this world.

1389
01:16:56,020 --> 01:17:00,015
I mean, it's enough
that the models are perfect.

1390
01:17:00,340 --> 01:17:02,975
You don't need
to go to the gym.

1391
01:17:06,260 --> 01:17:11,180
Charlie? When you
are looking at Patrick's pictures,

1392
01:17:11,220 --> 01:17:14,700
please do not retouch
Bob's stomach.

1393
01:17:16,300 --> 01:17:19,440
No, please don't, because
I don't want him to look like,

1394
01:17:19,540 --> 01:17:22,005
you know,
a skinny male model.

1395
01:17:25,020 --> 01:17:26,960
But I just wanted
to catch his stomach...

1396
01:17:27,060 --> 01:17:28,440
...before you gave him a--

1397
01:17:28,540 --> 01:17:31,345
He's pulling it in now
as I speak.

1398
01:17:35,260 --> 01:17:37,640
Okay. All right.
Thanks, bye.

1399
01:17:50,060 --> 01:17:51,280
I'd better go and finish it.
- Me, too.

1400
01:17:51,380 --> 01:17:52,240
Enjoy, guys.

1401
01:17:52,340 --> 01:17:54,340
So make it good now.

1402
01:17:54,540 --> 01:17:56,680
Twenties, the color block,
polished.

1403
01:17:56,780 --> 01:17:58,040
And then
what about her teeth?

1404
01:17:58,140 --> 01:17:59,440
Oh, I've been working
on this a lot.

1405
01:17:59,540 --> 01:18:00,400
Gonna fix her neck.

1406
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:01,800
So that's the new neck.

1407
01:18:01,900 --> 01:18:03,120
Yeah. It's the better covers.

1408
01:18:03,220 --> 01:18:05,520
This is the new neck on this.
- Okay, great.

1409
01:18:05,620 --> 01:18:08,600
So we have to write 'Sienna Miller'
large or people won't know.

1410
01:18:08,700 --> 01:18:13,545
You can't write 'Singular Sienna'
or 'Sensational Sienna.'

1411
01:18:15,860 --> 01:18:18,200
This all seems
so large and pretentious,

1412
01:18:18,300 --> 01:18:20,080
this type.

1413
01:18:20,180 --> 01:18:22,985
Looks like it's for blind people.

1414
01:18:27,100 --> 01:18:29,240
It's going to come out
like that, right?

1415
01:18:29,340 --> 01:18:32,120
Is she wearing feathers?
Are those feathers?

1416
01:18:32,220 --> 01:18:34,640
What are we supposed to do
with feathers this fall?

1417
01:18:34,740 --> 01:18:36,780
You just play with them.

1418
01:18:38,140 --> 01:18:39,360
And then there's a ring.

1419
01:18:39,460 --> 01:18:40,760
These aren't very good.
- No.

1420
01:18:40,860 --> 01:18:43,400
This is not in the correct order.
- Yes, it is.

1421
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:45,500
More like this.

1422
01:18:53,220 --> 01:18:55,240
Do we have the book
and the cover there?

1423
01:18:55,340 --> 01:18:56,440
Is everything updated?

1424
01:18:56,540 --> 01:18:58,540
Yes, Anna.

1425
01:19:05,260 --> 01:19:06,920
And this is our cover girl...

1426
01:19:07,020 --> 01:19:09,640
...whom we took to Rome
with Mario Testino.

1427
01:19:09,740 --> 01:19:12,120
She was interviewed here
by Sally Singer.

1428
01:19:12,220 --> 01:19:16,220
We had the idea to do
a sort of Jazz Age shoot.

1429
01:19:17,780 --> 01:19:21,460
That's Thakoon,
and on the right is Chanel.

1430
01:19:22,300 --> 01:19:24,300
And that is the issue.

1431
01:19:24,340 --> 01:19:26,720
Very nice, Anna.
- Thank you.

1432
01:19:28,740 --> 01:19:29,640
Oh, my God.

1433
01:19:29,740 --> 01:19:32,900
Wasn't Sienna
originally the lead?

1434
01:19:34,660 --> 01:19:36,660
Yes, it was.

1435
01:19:44,220 --> 01:19:46,430
Just one more spread here.

1436
01:19:49,580 --> 01:19:51,800
Then it will be
my whole issue just about,

1437
01:19:51,900 --> 01:19:53,900
except for Sienna.

1438
01:20:13,460 --> 01:20:15,460
It looks great.

1439
01:20:16,260 --> 01:20:18,000
Fashion's
not about looking back.

1440
01:20:18,100 --> 01:20:20,905
It's always
about looking forward.

1441
01:20:22,220 --> 01:20:24,460
Okay, next.

1442
01:20:27,180 --> 01:20:28,160
Move the board.

1443
01:20:28,260 --> 01:20:30,260
Yes, we will.

1444
01:20:30,820 --> 01:20:32,800
I don't believe for one minute...

1445
01:20:32,900 --> 01:20:35,560
...that I have a sense
of what's gonna happen...

1446
01:20:35,660 --> 01:20:40,060
...or a sense of real change
the way Grace does.

1447
01:20:40,100 --> 01:20:41,560
I mean, Grace is a genius,

1448
01:20:41,660 --> 01:20:44,920
and there is no one
that can visualize a picture...

1449
01:20:45,020 --> 01:20:47,320
...or understand
the direction of fashion...

1450
01:20:47,420 --> 01:20:50,260
...or produce a great shoot.

1451
01:20:50,300 --> 01:20:52,850
I mean, she's just remarkable.

1452
01:20:56,100 --> 01:20:58,000
She and I don't always agree,

1453
01:20:58,100 --> 01:21:00,880
but I think that
over the years we've learned...

1454
01:21:00,980 --> 01:21:05,825
...how to deal with each other's
different points of view.

1455
01:21:06,900 --> 01:21:08,900
Anna Wintour's office.

1456
01:21:09,220 --> 01:21:13,470
Is anyone coming
to this run-through except for me?

1457
01:21:19,780 --> 01:21:21,780
So what else?

1458
01:22:08,820 --> 01:22:12,680
You know you're featured
in 'The September lssue'?

1459
01:22:12,780 --> 01:22:14,780
No way.

1460
01:22:16,900 --> 01:22:18,900
When is it coming out?

1461
01:22:19,740 --> 01:22:21,740
Is this better?

1462
01:22:21,940 --> 01:22:23,940
This is authority.

1463
01:22:25,100 --> 01:22:27,100
This is it or nothing.

1464
01:22:27,700 --> 01:22:30,220
This is it or nothing, okay?

1465
01:22:30,260 --> 01:22:32,895
When I got the pose, strike it.

1466
01:22:32,900 --> 01:22:36,895
That was a stroke of genius
on my side, I think.

1467
01:22:37,220 --> 01:22:39,600
I turned the cameras on you.

1468
01:22:40,580 --> 01:22:43,880
And it just came to me, like,
I was walking along the corridor,

1469
01:22:43,980 --> 01:22:47,440
and I was like, 'Oh, my God,
they're looking at my rack again.'

1470
01:22:47,540 --> 01:22:49,940
'Hang on a minute.

1471
01:22:49,940 --> 01:22:51,940
'I'll teach them.'

1472
01:22:54,660 --> 01:22:55,560
What's your strength?

1473
01:22:55,660 --> 01:22:57,280
Decisiveness.

1474
01:22:57,380 --> 01:22:59,380
Your weakness?

1475
01:22:59,500 --> 01:23:01,240
My children.

1476
01:23:01,340 --> 01:23:03,465
What gift would you like?

1477
01:23:04,420 --> 01:23:06,420
A better backhand.
