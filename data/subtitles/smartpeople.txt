1
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,090
<i>Good morning.</i>

2
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:04,210
Because it's important
that we all get to know one another,

3
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,880
l would like you to wear these.

4
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,360
l've taken two other courses
from you. This year.

5
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:15,760
And you still don't
know what my name is, do you?

6
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:17,630
l most certainly do.

7
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:19,140
What is it?

8
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,730
-Look, Miss Chin...
-You just looked.

9
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:30,050
<i>The Price of Postmodernism:</i>

10
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,350
<i>Epistemology and the Literary Canon.</i>

11
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:35,750
l've never had to wait this long
for a response from a publisher.

12
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:37,520
<i>He said it's unpublishable.</i>

13
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,320
<i>-He said that?
-Yes.</i>

14
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:42,430
Leave a message to call me.

15
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:47,830
<i>Although we may think him
a curmudgeon</i>

16
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:51,170
<i>and see his Key to All Mythologies
as a monument to pedantry,</i>

17
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:54,000
she sees him
as the embodiment of virtue.

18
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:58,770
<i>For next time, read Maud. All of it.</i>

19
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:23,500
What are you doing?

20
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:32,250
There was a paper jam
in the Xerox machine.

21
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,840
Aren't you happy to see
your brother, Lawrence?

22
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:36,540
Adopted brother.

23
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:41,190
How's the kitchen knife sales?

24
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:43,850
Or was it aluminum siding?
How's that going?

25
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,190
Calling cards. lt's my new line.

26
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:49,850
lt's all kinds of great deals,
domestic and foreign.

27
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:54,430
We just added the tiny
island nation of Haiti. lt's a gold mine.

28
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,240
l'm glad to see
that you're doing meaningful work.

29
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,270
Lawrence, listen.
l wanted to ask a favor. But it's...

30
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:09,320
Not again, please.
l believe that l loaned you $ 1,200

31
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,320
the last time that you showed up,
two years ago.

32
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,280
And before that it was another $600.

33
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:14,820
And l'm going to...
l'm going to help you bloom.

34
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,250
Whatever it is that you're asking,

35
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:19,020
the answer is no.

36
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,450
l love you.

37
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:02,700
Hey, l'm sorry to bother you,
but do you have a moment

38
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,330
to discuss the character of Casaubon?

39
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,740
-Do you think that Eliot...
-My office hours are over.

40
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,670
The sign says they're till 5:00.

41
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,970
Okay, but my watch says it's 4:53.

42
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,450
That is official university time.

43
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:19,550
My watch, it's actually...
lt gets information by satellite,

44
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:22,180
and it's accurate
to one millionth of a second.

45
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:23,380
Take it up with maintenance.

46
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:26,860
Their offices are across the campus,
behind the stadium.

47
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,590
Of course, they close at 5:00.
Good luck to you.

48
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:54,650
Good evening.

49
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,620
Hey, Dad.

50
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,660
We need to discuss something.

51
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:09,530
What is Gibraltar's?

52
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,860
l've underlined over $300
worth of items

53
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:13,500
you charged there last month.

54
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:14,730
lt's an art bookstore.

55
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:18,040
l'm taking art history
and the books are expensive.

56
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:24,850
-l didn't know you wrote poetry.
-Well, there's a lot you don't know.

57
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,450
Shit!

58
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,970
l need my car.

59
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:03,780
l need my car.

60
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:07,750
Well, l'm going to need to see
your receipt from campus security.

61
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,730
Davidson will take care of it
on Monday.

62
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:12,130
l have an arrangement with him.

63
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,530
l can't give you your car
without a receipt.

64
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:16,260
l said Davidson will take care of it.

65
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:18,300
You don't even remember me, do you?

66
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:21,470
l took your Victorian poetry class
last spring.

67
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:22,970
Yes?

68
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:26,200
You gave me a D.

69
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:28,040
Yes, l remember.

70
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:31,780
-Ben Onufrey.
-Ben Onufrey.

71
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:33,380
No receipt, no vehicle.

72
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:36,720
l can see that you take your job
very seriously.

73
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:39,190
So how about that l offer you

74
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:42,320
$20 for your trouble?

75
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,160
According to rule 17-B

76
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:47,500
<i>in the Carnegie Mellon University
Traffic Citation Manual...</i>

77
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,700
Listen, you litigious little shit,
l need my briefcase.

78
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,260
Now stop your babbling,
open up that gate and let me in.

79
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:55,860
The only way you'll get in there

80
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,270
is if you pay the fine
and bring me the receipt.

81
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:01,110
At which point,
this ''litigious little shit''...

82
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,320
Hey!

83
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,700
Maybe you should spend less time
memorizing parking manuals

84
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:00,830
and more time being alert!

85
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,010
Mr. Wetherhold,
l need you to wake up.

86
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:16,050
Mr. Wetherhold,
l need you to wake up.

87
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,390
l was just resting my eyes.

88
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:20,490
Have you suffered seizures before?

89
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:21,690
Before what?

90
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,260
Before tonight.

91
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,760
You suffered a trauma-induced seizure
earlier this evening.

92
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:28,230
Do you know what day
of the week it is?

93
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,390
Yes.

94
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,130
Well?

95
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,300
Well, what?

96
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:38,170
Are you always this contentious,
or is this the result of the head trauma?

97
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,750
l prefer language to be precise.

98
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:45,110
Well, then you should have said,
''l prefer precise language,''

99
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,850
not ''l prefer language to be precise.''

100
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,390
l'm thirsty. Would you...

101
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:55,030
You need to stay overnight
for observation.

102
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,760
l need to make a phone call.

103
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,060
-Did he recognize you?
-No.

104
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,470
Well, you have aged.

105
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:11,370
Shut up. He told me
my language was imprecise.

106
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,610
Was it? lmprecise?

107
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:20,050
Hello?

108
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:22,950
<i>Hi, may I please speak
with Mrs. Wetherhold?</i>

109
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:34,430
l'm sorry, l'm not interested.

110
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:37,130
<i>May I please speak
to Mrs. Wetherhold?</i>

111
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:41,100
She's been dead for many years.
Thank you for the painful reminder.

112
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:43,300
Whatever it is you're peddling,
l'm not interested.

113
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:44,740
<i>I'm calling about your father.</i>

114
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:47,780
<i>He's not home.
Take us off your calling list.</i>

115
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:50,140
No, he's here in the ER.
He's had an accident.

116
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:55,950
-ls he okay?
-He's fine. He's resting.

117
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,020
He suffered a concussion
and a trauma-induced seizure.

118
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:01,030
<i>Are you familiar with
Allegheny General?</i>

119
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:03,100
'Cause l'm sure your father would love
to see you when he wakes.

120
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,660
<i>You know,
I'm taking the SA T tomorrow.</i>

121
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:08,430
And it is 10:00 right now,

122
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,560
which means
l have one more hour to practice

123
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:12,260
before l must go to bed.

124
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:15,970
You know, head injuries are often
more severe than they initially appear.

125
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,070
And your point?

126
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,980
Well, l would hate for you
to regret something as simple

127
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,340
as not visiting your father
in the hospital.

128
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:24,750
l appreciate the tip, Dr. Phil.

129
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:27,950
Little bitch.

130
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:29,040
Bitch.

131
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:43,000
Tetanus shot.

132
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:48,370
What happened to my car?
lt was in the impoundment lot.

133
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,580
l imagine it's still there.

134
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,870
lf anyone asks, l was mugged.

135
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,780
l'm not going to lie for you. Roll over.

136
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,370
Just be vague.

137
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,150
That's good.

138
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,890
There you go.

139
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:04,820
That was well done.

140
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:22,540
How nice of you to come.

141
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,270
So what happened to your head?

142
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:27,180
A big guy chased me.
l climbed a fence.

143
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:29,110
lt's all a blur.

144
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,480
Great, so now,
if l don't get the perfect score,

145
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,110
at least l have someone to blame.

146
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:36,120
And that adopted brother of yours,
Chuck, called.

147
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,350
He left a bunch of messages,

148
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:39,450
but l heard his voice
and deleted them all.

149
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,550
Yes, he showed up at
the office today, as well.

150
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,360
Oh!

151
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:47,960
lt was so nice of you to come.
l'm Dr. Hartigan.

152
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:51,300
Now, l want you to call your brother.

153
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,930
Tell him to get my car
out of the impound lot.

154
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,700
And to have it here at 9:00 a.m. sharp.

155
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,970
Excuse me. No, you do that.

156
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,780
You know, because of the seizure,
you can't legally drive for six months.

157
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,870
l have to report it to the DMV.

158
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:06,950
No, just don't report it.
Six months? Six months...

159
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:08,780
l'm not being your chauffeur
for six months.

160
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,750
These times are crucial.

161
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:14,820
Young Republicans. Model UN.
National Honor Society.

162
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:19,490
l will hire a driver on Monday.
The insurance company will pay for it.

163
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,790
Okay, well, if you need anything,
just have one of the nurses page me.

164
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,230
l'm here all night. Okay?

165
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:27,530
Now, just go home and get some sleep,

166
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,900
and you'll get that perfect SAT score.

167
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:31,640
That's what l've been trying to do.

168
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,080
Mercurial.

169
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,350
l learned that word in the fifth grade.

170
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:38,710
Fecundity.

171
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:42,050
English is my first language.

172
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:43,580
Uxorious.

173
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:47,550
That's appropriately obscure.
Mind you, l know it.

174
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,750
Overly fond of one's wife.

175
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,350
That's my girl.

176
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,390
l have a good one.

177
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,060
Eft.

178
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,890
Let me ponder.

179
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:01,970
Short in stature. Diminutive.

180
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:06,280
No, sorry. Eft is a young newt.

181
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:10,110
They rarely put nouns on the SAT.

182
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:21,120
You knew that word, right?

183
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:23,820
Of course. A young newt.

184
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:28,900
l don't understand why
you had to check out so early.

185
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,530
l only get one Saturday morning
per week, you know.

186
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,360
Cry me a river.

187
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:37,400
Get off it, James.

188
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:39,870
So why did you try to jump
the fence

189
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,140
at the impoundment lot, anyway?

190
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,840
Where did you hear about the fence?

191
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:45,210
Two people from school
told me this morning.

192
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,810
Can you please move
to the passenger seat?

193
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:50,320
l seriously doubt that sitting
on the right makes you sick.

194
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,910
lf l vomit, we'll both look stupid.

195
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:58,120
l remember when Mom used to drop
me off at kindergarten on Brighton.

196
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:00,720
You sat in the passenger seat then.

197
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,410
What the hell are you doing here?

198
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:23,010
Watching a documentary
on snow apes.

199
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,560
Hey, man.

200
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,120
Hey, Jim.

201
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:28,090
Good to see you, Chuck.

202
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:30,020
You look like you had
another growth spurt.

203
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:32,620
No, l don't think so.
Not since l saw you last.

204
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:33,720
l'm too old for this.

205
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:37,130
l would like an explanation.
Why are you here?

206
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,700
Vanessa said that
you couldn't drive for six months.

207
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:42,600
So l'm here to help.

208
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:45,370
Yeah, he's pretty sure he's
gonna move in and be your driver.

209
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,140
l think l got the perfect score today.

210
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:50,280
There was one tricky math one...

211
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:55,650
Did it ever occur to you that
l might not want you to drive me?

212
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:57,780
Let alone move in.

213
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:59,690
lt did occur to me,

214
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:03,420
but Vanessa spoke
to the insurance company,

215
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,030
and they're not going to pay
for a chauffeur.

216
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:08,500
And l already wrote a letter of complaint

217
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,090
and l wrote a request for an appeal.

218
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,760
So, if l could just get
your signature, and l will fax it.

219
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,900
l'm a little low on cash right now.

220
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:21,570
l can't really afford
to get my own apartment.

221
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,880
So it's kind of a win-win situation.

222
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:27,980
No. lt's not a win-win situation.

223
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:31,450
lt might be,
if you were even vaguely reliable,

224
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:35,220
-but you're not.
-There's a spare room upstairs.

225
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:37,660
-There's linens and towels...
-Shh. Shh.

226
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:42,120
Thank you, Jim.

227
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,430
Do you even have
a valid driver's license?

228
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:57,110
l need a ride to campus.
l will see you downstairs

229
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:59,450
-in five minutes.
-You got it!

230
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,020
Make a left.

231
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:44,620
We need someone
with a national scholarly reputation

232
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:46,460
and strong leadership experience.

233
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:50,800
Well, thank you, Martin.
l am honored to serve in the position.

234
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,160
You heard?

235
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,870
Word travels fast around here.

236
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,700
Usually it's a pain in the butt
to find someone

237
00:16:57,810 --> 00:16:59,470
to chair the search committee.

238
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,070
l thought we were hiring
from within the department.

239
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:06,380
You told me we were hiring
from within the department.

240
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:08,950
Well, everyone else
is so busy this semester.

241
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:11,860
Delivering papers, publishing.

242
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,930
Have you read
what they're publishing?

243
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:15,620
Most of it's garbage.

244
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:17,290
That's not very collegial.

245
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:21,270
Well, neither is forcing me
to chair this search committee, Martin.

246
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:22,800
l am busy, too.

247
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,270
When was the last time
you attended a department meeting?

248
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:26,340
When was the last time

249
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,410
there was anything on the agenda
worth discussing?

250
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:30,370
l need you to do this.

251
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:32,470
Bon appÃ©tit, Martin.

252
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:37,710
Now that Roth has forced me
to chair the search committee,

253
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:40,310
l can't very well
nominate myself now, can l?

254
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,550
You should have had that position
eight years ago.

255
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,590
l mean, that was a travesty
if l ever saw one.

256
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:46,320
You were nine years old at the time.

257
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:48,950
l will tell Roth
that this injury is too much

258
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,390
and it precludes me
from heading the committee.

259
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,860
Why do you even want
to be head of the department?

260
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:55,800
You don't like any of
the other professors

261
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,340
and you certainly don't like
any of your students.

262
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,930
You know, James,
there was a time not too long ago

263
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,100
when students were
passionate about literature.

264
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:05,680
Today's students are
only passionate about getting A's.

265
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:09,650
Dick Cheney.

266
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:14,040
His daughter is a lesbian.

267
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:18,050
And while her partner is
considered to be ''one of the family,''

268
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:21,020
they never allowed her
on stage during the campaign.

269
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:23,690
Okay, well, the point is, in 2000,

270
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:27,700
Cheney was the chair of Bush's
vice-presidential search committee.

271
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,100
You know, he nominated himself.

272
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:34,160
Nominating myself?
lt seems rather unethical.

273
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:37,000
lt's the democratic process.

274
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:41,710
lf it can work
for the Vice-President of America,

275
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,250
it can work for you.

276
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:50,450
l wanted to call you
all together, one last time,

277
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,790
before we were deep into final exams.

278
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:55,520
We've received over 200 applications.

279
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:59,560
Fewer than 10 of the applications
merit serious consideration.

280
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,090
Based on what criteria?

281
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,600
The criteria listed in the official
university bylaws on faculty hires.

282
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:06,930
When we did this before,

283
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,530
we spent a few sessions
devising a rubric

284
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,630
for candidate evaluations.

285
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:14,500
One based on more humanistic ideals.

286
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,540
A few of the better applicants

287
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:21,180
forgot to include copies
of their student evaluations

288
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:22,410
with their applications.

289
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,320
Personally, l find the evaluations

290
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:27,290
that students write about me
utterly useless.

291
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:30,290
lt's mostly just speculation
about my sexuality.

292
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:35,790
Try not to blink.

293
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:38,300
This is rather uncomfortable.

294
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,870
Okay. We're set, Mr. Wetherhold.

295
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,610
How come my follow-up
wasn't with Dr. Hartigan?

296
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,580
That's because she's the head
of the ER,

297
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:51,080
not a neurologist like myself.

298
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:53,740
You know, she's gonna kill me
for saying this,

299
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:57,190
but she used to be a student of yours,
years ago.

300
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,850
l've had lots of students.

301
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:02,890
l think she had a schoolgirl crush,
in effect.

302
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:08,060
She did, did she? Are we done?

303
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:09,560
Yeah.

304
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:11,740
Pleasure.

305
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:14,870
Yeah. Still around.

306
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:16,340
Here you go, miss.

307
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:17,800
Hi.

308
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,540
How's your head?
Did you see Dr. Strouse yet?

309
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,850
Yes, everything is fine.

310
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:31,680
l figured it out.

311
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:34,150
You were my student.

312
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,800
You must forgive me
for not remembering the other night

313
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,630
when they brought me into the ER.

314
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:48,700
Did you lose weight?

315
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,540
No, not at all. Same weight.

316
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:56,480
Night.

317
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:08,530
What are you doing?

318
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:10,030
Are these your mom's?

319
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:12,290
Don't get mayonnaise on them.

320
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:22,810
You know,
you should really make your bed.

321
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:24,470
lt sets the tone for the day.

322
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:28,040
How do you know what tone
l wanted to set, though?

323
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:37,690
Don't you think it's kind of weird

324
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:40,780
to keep dead people's clothes
lying around?

325
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:43,660
-Yes.
-Dad's been saving them.

326
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,450
lt's really not a good thing for him.

327
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:50,730
lf we donate them to Goodwill,
we get a tax write-off,

328
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:54,000
which is great.

329
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,740
You're a monster.

330
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:15,050
May l give you a ride home?

331
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:19,790
No, thank you. My adopted brother
is supposed to pick me up.

332
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,360
Are you sure? lt's pretty cold.

333
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,670
Okay, thank you.

334
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:35,140
Here.

335
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:04,070
Don't forget the tax receipt.

336
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,300
Right.

337
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:09,470
You know, you can sit up front
if you want.

338
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,380
That's okay. l'm fine.

339
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:13,910
l get

340
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:18,550
nauseated if l ride
on the right-hand side of the car.

341
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:25,590
Dr. Strouse said l was fine

342
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:28,330
and l was wondering
if you could call the DMV

343
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:31,340
and have them repeal
my driving restriction.

344
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:33,500
That's not how it works.

345
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:40,480
So what are you teaching
this semester?

346
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:43,840
l'm teaching two sections
about the Victorians.

347
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,450
Do you like the Victorians?

348
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,880
l used to.

349
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,420
-The Victorian novel, huh?
-Hmm.

350
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:58,830
<i>Wow, how many times
can you read Bleak House?</i>

351
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:01,000
<i>You never tire of Bleak House.</i>

352
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:04,160
l can always find something new
to say about it.

353
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,870
Don't you have anything better to do?

354
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:31,760
You need to relax.

355
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,400
You need to relax. l need to study.

356
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:44,170
Great, l'm in an after-school special.

357
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:46,780
You know, your dad used to smoke
all the time

358
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,900
when he was in grad school.

359
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:49,000
Oh, yeah?

360
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:52,170
He was too scared to buy it,
so l'd have to do it for him.

361
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,380
They called him Hookah Larry.

362
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:58,120
Look, your pathetic attempts
to manipulate me,

363
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:00,320
they're never going to work.

364
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:24,110
Okay, shut up and give it to me.

365
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,750
lf this gives me brain damage,

366
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:31,020
l will kill you.

367
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:39,400
Lupita is crying over Pedro,
who is being abused by Manuel.

368
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,190
She's going to leave Manuel,
you know.

369
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:43,130
<i>He's such a machismo.</i>

370
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:47,810
She's going to move in with Diego.

371
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:50,270
He's really handsome and built.

372
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:55,010
lf your Spanish were better,
you would see all of that.

373
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,750
Thank you for driving me.

374
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,590
You're welcome.

375
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:16,720
This is your house, right?

376
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,900
Yes.

377
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:34,450
Shit. Wait! Wait! Wait!

378
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,320
l forgot this.

379
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:48,200
Would you

380
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,360
like to have a face-to-face

381
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:53,000
conversation sometime?

382
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:57,440
We could finish our
discussion of Victorian literature.

383
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:01,880
We weren't really having a
conversation about Victorian literature.

384
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:07,240
l suppose l'd have to drive.

385
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:10,750
l hadn't thought of that.

386
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:16,760
How about Friday night at 7:30

387
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:19,190
for a face-to-face conversation?

388
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,990
That would work.

389
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,560
Okay, bye.

390
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,290
Smell something burning?

391
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:45,180
Maybe cannabis?

392
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,920
Are you mad?

393
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:53,660
l waited outside
the medical center for eons.

394
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:56,590
Where were you?

395
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,330
Helping Vanessa with her Spanish.

396
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:03,000
Lost track of time, sorry.

397
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:17,620
Where'd you get that?

398
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:20,210
The closet.

399
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:22,850
l told him Wellesley
was a women's college.

400
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:24,990
That's Caroline's sweatshirt.

401
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,960
That, too. l told him that, too. l told him

402
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:30,190
it was Mom's sweatshirt.

403
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:34,200
Take it off, please.

404
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:40,570
Did it ever occur to you
that l might be saving that sweatshirt?

405
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,410
Please don't rip it.

406
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,390
l think
he may have smelled the pot.

407
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:58,400
''l told him Wellesley
was a women's college.''

408
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,870
God, what a narc.

409
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:32,220
You know, we didn't just
donate her clothes on a whim.

410
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:35,130
We did it for your
psychological well-being.

411
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:37,230
Will you wait in the car?

412
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:49,140
Let's see, ''Professor Wetherhold
is a conceited dickhead,''

413
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:52,050
''An asshole,'' ''Unfair...''

414
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:53,140
Here's one.

415
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:54,620
What does it say?

416
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,210
''Professor Wetherhold
is knowledgeable,

417
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,590
''but he doesn't impart that knowledge
to his students.

418
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:00,890
''He barked information at us
all semester,

419
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:03,190
''and then he complained
when our papers did not measure up

420
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,200
''to his bizarre standards.''

421
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,120
l'll dig deeper.

422
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:14,300
Hey, can we go to the mall
tonight instead of this afternoon?

423
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:16,200
There's, like, three games
l want to watch.

424
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:18,610
l can't go to the mall tonight.

425
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,240
-Why's that?
-l'm busy.

426
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:24,840
Yeah, busy with what?
l fucking gotta go to the mall.

427
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:26,780
l have an appointment.

428
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:28,880
-Really?
-Yes.

429
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:30,320
With who?

430
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:33,590
-With none of your business.
-An appointment with whom?

431
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:34,750
None of your business.

432
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:37,590
l just want to know. God!

433
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:41,190
Dr. Hartigan.

434
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:44,840
-l knew it.
-Good work.

435
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:48,540
You spend $50 on dinner,

436
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,440
that's grounds for intercourse
with ''none of your business.''

437
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:55,240
Dad, if there are any romantic inklings,
you're simply not ready.

438
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:58,480
l mean the sociosexual
mores have really shifted.

439
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:03,290
And look, let's not forget
the stigma attached to widowers.

440
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:08,630
Widowers. At some point the statute
of limitations has gotta run out on that.

441
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:11,390
We're not talking about this anymore.

442
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:17,700
Don't freak out and sabotage it
like you always do.

443
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,330
l don't always freak out
and sabotage it.

444
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:23,640
Yeah, well, this hospital is littered
with men you've left in your wake.

445
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:26,970
lt's littered with men
you've left in your wake, too.

446
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,550
-What are you doing?
-Nothing.

447
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:33,320
Nothing. l'm just reading something.
l'll call you back, okay?

448
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,770
-Hi.
-Hi, there.

449
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,240
How are you?

450
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,050
What are you doing here?

451
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:05,850
Excuse me?

452
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:11,480
He's kind of a fragile guy.

453
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,760
You know, he's not ready for this.

454
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:17,330
He's fragile? What do you mean?

455
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:21,420
You know what?
lt's quite predatory, actually.

456
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,790
Have you forgotten about
the Hippocratic oath you took,

457
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,930
about not fucking your patients?

458
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:31,640
Your father's no longer my patient.

459
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:51,190
We respond to literary texts

460
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:55,260
using precisely the same
fundamental interpretive categories

461
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:57,630
as authors and poets use
to create them.

462
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:01,190
So there's no need to posit
any kind of unstable ontology

463
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:03,000
or ruptured consciousness.

464
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:04,580
-Are you following me?
-Yeah.

465
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,440
Any coffee?
Something from the desert menu?

466
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:08,600
-Yeah. l want...
-lt's too late for coffee.

467
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:11,010
l'll tell you what.

468
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,920
One piece of chocolate cake
and two forks, two plates.

469
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,310
-So no one...
-Thank you.

470
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:22,690
...has ever looked at this process
of cultural criticism through the...

471
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:24,130
45 minutes.

472
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,860
-Excuse me?
-45 minutes.

473
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:32,460
That's how long it's been
since l've uttered a single word.

474
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:36,200
l mean, do you even know
where l'm from?

475
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:37,710
Where l grew up, where l live?

476
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:39,330
Do you know anything
about my family?

477
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,540
What kind of day did l have?

478
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:44,640
Well, if you actually did want to know,

479
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:47,650
l was having a great day
until about 30 minutes ago

480
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:49,980
when l realized
you weren't gonna shut up.

481
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:56,280
ln fact, you actually gave me a C
in your course.

482
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,690
You said my paper was sophomoric.

483
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,790
l was a freshman.

484
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:03,400
That's not what sophomoric means.

485
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,490
l know. See, l know that.

486
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:08,040
You know, the other night
when l drove you home,

487
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:11,270
l actually thought l saw
a different side of you.

488
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:17,050
But now l'm back to thinking
you're the same pompous windbag

489
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:19,740
who made me switch my major
from English to Biology.

490
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:23,790
Well. Certainly an established
physician is not harboring resentment

491
00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:26,190
for a grade she received
more than 10 years ago.

492
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:27,990
This was a mistake.

493
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:31,000
Your daughter was right.

494
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:33,330
Thank you.

495
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:37,030
lt's probably better
if you get a cab home.

496
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:54,280
l take it by your presence here at 8:45,
you did not get laid.

497
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:59,390
Yeah, come in, unless it's Chuck.

498
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:02,320
l'm back.

499
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:03,390
Thank God.

500
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:10,230
This is a good-sized room.

501
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:13,830
Yeah, l'm pretty sure
you've been in here before.

502
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:20,040
Do you think l'm self-absorbed?

503
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:24,370
l think self-absorption's underrated.

504
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:29,750
l think everyone needs
some compassion,

505
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:33,620
some capacity for sympathy, empathy.

506
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:36,520
-Right?
-Dad,

507
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:41,060
Theresa Sternbridge practically runs
a soup kitchen,

508
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:45,640
and she's always seen posing
in photos with crack babies

509
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,500
and dying, old, crusty ladies.

510
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:51,500
And do you know why?

511
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:56,310
She scored in the 45th percentile
on her SAT.

512
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:02,380
People like you and me
don't need to compensate.

513
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:05,760
You know, l'm glad you're home early.

514
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:07,330
That physician wasn't good for you.

515
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:07,690
That physician wasn't good for you.

516
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:10,960
Too young and kind of uncultured,

517
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:14,400
like oh-so-many
in the medical profession...

518
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:17,800
l thought of the perfect new title
for your book.

519
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,800
Right?

520
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:29,480
Good night.

521
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:30,940
<i>Bonsoir.</i>

522
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:55,800
<i>Someone please shed some light</i>

523
00:36:56,270 --> 00:37:01,210
<i>Where is the narrator in my life</i>

524
00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:06,980
<i>Maybe he doesn't know where I've fled</i>

525
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:11,380
<i>Running through the city in my head</i>

526
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:18,460
<i>I shed regret</i>

527
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,250
What are you doing here?

528
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,390
That gurney was sterile.

529
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:17,950
l re-read your essay.

530
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,120
And...

531
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:22,290
At first l considered
giving it a higher grade,

532
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:25,950
but then, l decided
that the C should stick.

533
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:30,130
Do you honestly think
that l care about a grade l received

534
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,000
when l was a freshman in college?

535
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:34,900
l mean, l admit that the paper,
as you originally wrote,

536
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:38,500
''lacks a clear focus
and rambles like a bad folk song.''

537
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:42,910
But l read it again the other day
and its thesis is really quite good.

538
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:50,790
l should have been more diplomatic
and less pompous as your professor

539
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:53,450
and as your dinner date.

540
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,020
True.

541
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:57,890
l'm just out of practice.

542
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,330
What? Usually you're better
at masking your pomposity?

543
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:04,300
Could we give this

544
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:09,310
face-to-face conversation
one more try?

545
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:14,840
l haven't been on a date in a while.

546
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:22,090
l'd have to drive again, l suppose.

547
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:37,890
Merry Christmas!

548
00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:10,060
Fuck!

549
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:13,340
lt was clever of you
to reserve the same table.

550
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:17,630
l wanted to make sure
that l had an authentic second chance.

551
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:24,040
Would you like
to start with some wine?

552
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:26,710
Well, l'm on call tonight,
so l can't drink.

553
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:30,980
-You're on call?
-Yeah.

554
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:34,090
So this date may end at any moment?

555
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:36,230
Well, if l'm paged, yes.

556
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:37,560
-l can come back in a minute.
-No, no.

557
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:40,530
lt's okay. lt's okay.
l will have the lobster,

558
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:43,670
and a house salad, and
the house dressing on the side, please.

559
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:44,890
And for you, sir?

560
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,630
Oh, yes, the clock is ticking.

561
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:48,930
l'm going to have the cod

562
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:53,480
and house salad,
house dressing on the side.

563
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:07,120
l'm sorry l called you
an arrogant windbag the other night.

564
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:09,520
You called me a pompous windbag.

565
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:15,730
So have you heard back yet from any
of the publishers about your book?

566
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:19,740
Did you ever tell me
where you're from?

567
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,360
Well, how long ago did you send it?

568
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:24,640
Well, a few weeks ago.
What did your parents do?

569
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:28,340
-What are you doing?
-What do you mean?

570
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:30,040
l'm asking you about the book.

571
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:32,810
Yes, and l'm not taking the bait, am l?

572
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:36,820
Come on, l'm interested in the book.

573
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:44,630
lt's been rejected by a few publishers.

574
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:50,030
Actually, it's been rejected
by everyone, so...

575
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:54,070
Rejection is tough.

576
00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:57,500
lt can scar you for life.

577
00:41:58,410 --> 00:41:59,380
But you can rewrite it.

578
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,640
You can, you know,
send it out again, can't you?

579
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:14,220
lt's about time!

580
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,430
That's some real riveting shit there.

581
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:26,030
You Young Republicans
really know how to party.

582
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:28,070
Bet you guys are a lot of fun
on Friday nights.

583
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:29,500
l have fun.

584
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:33,530
You're at a Hitler Youth Rally
the first night of Christmas break.

585
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:36,140
My fun is just a little more cerebral
than yours.

586
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:39,270
Come on. When was the last time
you did something bad?

587
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:42,880
Or subversive? Huh?
Like a normal teenager.

588
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:43,950
Do you know what you're doing?

589
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:45,850
Jesus.

590
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:49,320
l bet you never cheated
or stole anything.

591
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:51,090
Or jaywalked.

592
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,600
Well, l've smoked pot
with my perverted uncle.

593
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:57,430
Okay, that was because l coerced you.

594
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:00,330
You didn't do that of your own volition.
You know what?

595
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:03,930
You're really in jeopardy of becoming
a 17-year-old robot.

596
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,240
Okay, shut up.

597
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:07,610
'Cause you really don't know me.

598
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:11,480
l actually got accepted to Stanford
two weeks ago.

599
00:43:14,490 --> 00:43:17,550
Really? But Carnegie Mellon is free
for you.

600
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:21,320
And Stanford's, l don't know,
$600-$ 700 a year.

601
00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:23,830
40 grand, actually.

602
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:29,190
Well, your father is gonna kill you.

603
00:43:29,970 --> 00:43:33,670
But for the time being,
l'm filled with pride.

604
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:38,770
Come on, little mermaid,
let's go celebrate.

605
00:43:50,290 --> 00:43:53,090
Think older. You'll appear older.

606
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:57,130
l want you to grab that table.
l'm gonna get a pitcher of beer.

607
00:43:58,230 --> 00:44:02,600
<i>There's too many things I can't afford</i>

608
00:44:04,570 --> 00:44:09,010
<i>So what do you mean when you say</i>

609
00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:14,910
Keep your eye out, there's a guy
over there that used to be a woman.

610
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:16,600
Out on the town with Grandpa?

611
00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:17,980
Fuck off.

612
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:20,840
-Those seem like nice girls.
-Yeah.

613
00:44:22,690 --> 00:44:26,920
<i>I wouldn't wanna rush you
lose you</i>

614
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:28,580
<i>Fuss you</i>

615
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:32,160
<i>But I love love love you</i>

616
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:33,920
That's disgusting.

617
00:44:35,230 --> 00:44:36,930
That is disgusting.

618
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,970
You must miss your wife.

619
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:47,180
Sorry, l shouldn't be so direct.

620
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,710
lf my wife, Caroline,
were here right now,

621
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:53,610
she would be telling me
to stop pitying myself.

622
00:44:55,190 --> 00:44:58,950
She was a lovely,
funny, intelligent woman.

623
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:02,020
And she'd want you to know it.

624
00:45:02,290 --> 00:45:06,530
But she'd also advise me
not to talk about my dead wife

625
00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:10,970
on a date with a beautiful woman.

626
00:45:14,410 --> 00:45:16,600
And she'd be wondering

627
00:45:17,410 --> 00:45:20,900
when l was going to get around
to kissing you.

628
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:29,850
<i>I wouldn't wanna rush you
lose you</i>

629
00:45:29,950 --> 00:45:31,350
<i>Fuss you</i>

630
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:35,760
<i>I wouldn't wanna rush you
lose you</i>

631
00:45:36,290 --> 00:45:37,590
<i>Fuss you</i>

632
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,400
<i>But I love love love you</i>

633
00:45:42,730 --> 00:45:45,130
<i>Love love love you</i>

634
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:48,930
<i>Said I love love love you</i>

635
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:52,070
<i>Love love love you</i>

636
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:55,940
What is it like being stupid?

637
00:45:56,410 --> 00:45:59,440
What's it like sitting alone
at lunch every day?

638
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,180
lt sucks.

639
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,280
Come with me.

640
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:23,500
l'm

641
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:29,240
not used to condoms,
but l thought it went okay.

642
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:32,880
Very nice.

643
00:46:36,350 --> 00:46:39,410
'Cause l just don't want
to blow it with you.

644
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:48,400
Do you have any plans for Christmas?

645
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:56,170
Will you excuse me for a minute?

646
00:47:01,450 --> 00:47:04,970
'Cause my daughter, Vanessa,
makes quite a spread.

647
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:33,970
l was just paged.

648
00:47:39,350 --> 00:47:41,880
l haven't been up this late in years.

649
00:47:41,990 --> 00:47:46,720
<i>If this were a book
It'd start with a line</i>

650
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:52,820
<i>I once knew a man
I was his and he was mine</i>

651
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:57,790
<i>So predictable
So confused</i>

652
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:05,480
<i>I'm at a loss for words
to explain my mood</i>

653
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:12,980
<i>I stitch this bow
into the bottom of my dress</i>

654
00:48:33,370 --> 00:48:35,360
Linsey hates me, you know?

655
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:38,740
Brooke hates me. Everybody hates me.

656
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:45,270
Well, if you tell people they're
stupid, they'll usually hate you.

657
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:49,020
And l wasn't completely

658
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:53,960
congenial when you first came.

659
00:49:02,670 --> 00:49:04,130
You're right.

660
00:49:04,370 --> 00:49:07,060
-But you like me now.
-l like you now.

661
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:11,270
Vanessa,

662
00:49:13,210 --> 00:49:14,540
come on...

663
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:18,110
You're adopted. lt's not like it's...

664
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:20,980
Biblical...

665
00:49:22,850 --> 00:49:24,880
You just want to fuck
that trashy waitress.

666
00:49:24,990 --> 00:49:27,180
Yeah, that's none of your business.

667
00:49:27,290 --> 00:49:31,230
You're drunk
and you're 17 and you're my niece.

668
00:49:31,330 --> 00:49:36,200
-My shoe.
-Great idea, giving you beer.

669
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:45,970
Come on.

670
00:49:48,150 --> 00:49:49,340
Hey, you!

671
00:49:50,210 --> 00:49:51,680
Are you drunk?

672
00:49:55,190 --> 00:49:56,980
-Did you get her drunk?
-No.

673
00:49:57,090 --> 00:50:00,060
-She seems drunk.
-She's drunk.

674
00:50:04,730 --> 00:50:06,360
How was your date?

675
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:09,030
You're a giant toddler.

676
00:50:11,370 --> 00:50:13,000
Mom and Dad
did you absolutely no favors,

677
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:17,940
allowing you to become
the immature scam artist that you are.

678
00:51:02,590 --> 00:51:06,450
Vanessa, did anyone call me today?

679
00:51:07,990 --> 00:51:10,980
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, a telemarketer.

680
00:51:11,130 --> 00:51:12,600
lt was a man.

681
00:51:13,130 --> 00:51:15,330
You're acting very desperate.

682
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:23,030
l got it.

683
00:51:25,610 --> 00:51:27,580
Will you stop avoiding me?

684
00:51:28,550 --> 00:51:29,910
l was drunk.

685
00:51:31,850 --> 00:51:32,940
l'm not avoiding you.

686
00:51:33,050 --> 00:51:36,110
l just need some time alone, please.

687
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:48,360
Thank you.

688
00:52:22,970 --> 00:52:26,100
Hi, Janet, sorry to leave you
yet another message,

689
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:28,470
but l realized that you may not have
my phone number,

690
00:52:28,570 --> 00:52:31,270
and that's why you haven't
called me back.

691
00:52:31,910 --> 00:52:33,400
<i>My number is...</i>

692
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:50,490
Didn't you prove the other night
that you can't hold your alcohol?

693
00:52:50,590 --> 00:52:52,690
l'm having one glass, moron.

694
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:57,800
And l chose this Beaujolais
specifically to go with the ham.

695
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:12,040
Neither of you is old enough
to be drinking.

696
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:16,620
Dude.

697
00:53:18,190 --> 00:53:19,850
Let's all just get drunk.

698
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:22,260
l need something
to wash down this rubber ham.

699
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:25,730
Actually, l downloaded the recipe
from the lnternet.

700
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:29,030
l translated it from Old French.

701
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:32,300
lt dates all the way back to Louis XlV.

702
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:33,730
And he was the one
that actually decided

703
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:36,070
dishes should be served in courses,

704
00:53:36,170 --> 00:53:40,580
because before that,
it was served as this big pile of food...

705
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:43,910
Maybe you messed up the translation,
and that's why it tastes like burnt tires.

706
00:53:44,010 --> 00:53:46,950
Well, if you'd like,
l could jam that up your ass for you?

707
00:53:47,050 --> 00:53:49,750
That's enough. Enough.

708
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:56,520
-Well, this is cheerful.
-Shut up.

709
00:53:58,430 --> 00:54:02,530
Who would think to interrupt
this perfect Christmas dinner?

710
00:54:15,110 --> 00:54:16,910
-Hi.
-Hi.

711
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:18,970
You're the doctor girlfriend, right?

712
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:21,480
You're the adopted brother, right?

713
00:54:23,090 --> 00:54:25,250
Well, you don't appear to be boring.

714
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:28,790
Well, you've just met me.
For all you know, l'm quite boring.

715
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:30,590
You've presented yourself here,

716
00:54:30,690 --> 00:54:33,090
uninvited and unannounced
for Christmas dinner.

717
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:36,100
That is not boring. And the cake?

718
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:41,160
Lexotonin? That's an antidepressant.

719
00:54:41,270 --> 00:54:43,540
l stole it from the break room.

720
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:47,610
-Am l interrupting anything?
-No, welcome.

721
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:49,950
We could use a little antivenom
in the snake pit.

722
00:54:50,050 --> 00:54:52,910
Thank you very much.
Move along, thank you.

723
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:54,010
Hi.

724
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:56,180
Hi. Merry Christmas.

725
00:54:56,290 --> 00:54:57,850
Merry Christmas.

726
00:55:10,130 --> 00:55:12,100
The woman brought a cake.

727
00:55:15,170 --> 00:55:16,330
Hello.

728
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:20,070
Vanessa!

729
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:22,240
l'm getting the physician a plate!

730
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:49,400
My, what a generous portion.

731
00:55:49,510 --> 00:55:50,500
Enjoy.

732
00:55:50,610 --> 00:55:52,470
Well, Vanessa here
is the perfect little housewife.

733
00:55:52,580 --> 00:55:53,770
l mean, daughter.

734
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:55,640
Yes, if, by perfect, you mean

735
00:55:55,750 --> 00:56:00,120
<i>not retardedlsuffering from
insurmountable credit card debt,</i>

736
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:02,480
then, yes, l am indeed perfect.

737
00:56:02,590 --> 00:56:05,080
Would you two please stop bickering?

738
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:08,650
These children haven't
been properly parented in many years.

739
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:09,950
That's why l was brought in.

740
00:56:10,060 --> 00:56:12,860
To ensure that they don't
kill each other.

741
00:56:14,670 --> 00:56:16,260
Merry Christmas.

742
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:21,800
Please.

743
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:27,010
''So much depends upon

744
00:56:27,110 --> 00:56:28,080
''a red wheelbarrow...''

745
00:56:28,710 --> 00:56:30,770
William Carlos Williams.

746
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:32,810
He was a physician.

747
00:56:33,450 --> 00:56:35,040
Yes, l know that.

748
00:56:36,290 --> 00:56:40,310
Many considered him to be an imagist,
but he was really more of a modernist,

749
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:42,520
eschewing the poetic traditions
of Europe,

750
00:56:42,630 --> 00:56:45,690
in favor of celebrating
everyday circumstances.

751
00:56:47,930 --> 00:56:49,520
But l digress.

752
00:56:51,970 --> 00:56:54,700
l like suburban Pittsburgh
for Christmas.

753
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:57,330
Yes, it's really glamorous.

754
00:56:57,880 --> 00:56:59,140
You're in the

755
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:03,150
Paris of Western Pennsylvania.

756
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:09,150
l'm really glad that you stopped by.

757
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:22,760
l just saw Dad and the physician
kissing in the den.

758
00:57:22,870 --> 00:57:24,530
l am going to puke.

759
00:57:24,870 --> 00:57:27,890
Why does physical affection
bother you so much?

760
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:29,970
lt doesn't, actually.

761
00:57:30,210 --> 00:57:32,940
Well, you're not the only one
who deserves to have a little fun.

762
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:34,440
And what's your point?

763
00:57:34,550 --> 00:57:37,040
l saw you both at Gibraltar's. Drunk.

764
00:57:37,150 --> 00:57:38,380
l saw you, too.

765
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:40,640
l saw you, too, man. Bravo.

766
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:55,850
l am proud that we whittled it down
to these three so quickly.

767
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:58,250
l have another candidate in mind.

768
00:57:58,990 --> 00:58:00,020
Who?

769
00:58:01,690 --> 00:58:02,680
Me.

770
00:58:02,930 --> 00:58:06,260
Can you apply?
You're the chair of the committee.

771
00:58:06,530 --> 00:58:09,190
Yes, l am permitted to apply.

772
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:13,000
lt's well within Carnegie Mellon's
ethical codes of conduct.

773
00:58:13,110 --> 00:58:15,900
lt's part of the democratic process.

774
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:20,980
Tick, tock.

775
00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:25,170
But now, in the new days...

776
00:58:26,690 --> 00:58:30,780
Do you know its meaning?
You drove yourself...

777
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:35,920
When l come back,
you better have a word on that board.

778
00:58:41,470 --> 00:58:44,530
Vanessa, this phone
is for emergencies only.

779
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:48,270
l didn't want to call you
at her apartment. l just, like...

780
00:58:48,370 --> 00:58:49,860
Are you coming home for dinner?

781
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:52,880
Because Chuck's gone
and l'm the only one here.

782
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:54,880
l'm eating here tonight.

783
00:58:54,980 --> 00:58:57,450
Well, that's just fantastic.

784
00:58:57,980 --> 00:59:00,820
What am l supposed to do
with the beef stroganoff that l made,

785
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:02,850
and the garlic whipped potatoes?

786
00:59:05,990 --> 00:59:09,330
l'm going to be home in a few hours,
could you save me a little bit?

787
00:59:09,730 --> 00:59:11,160
<i>Just a plate.</i>

788
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:22,800
This is Lawrence Wetherhold.
Who is this?

789
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:26,110
<i>This is Deb Rosenblatt,
from the Penguin Group.</i>

790
00:59:26,250 --> 00:59:28,110
<i>Bloomberg really liked
your manuscript</i>

791
00:59:28,210 --> 00:59:29,410
<i>and he would like to meet
with you in New York.</i>

792
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:30,710
Well,

793
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:33,680
it is a very interesting concept, isn't it?

794
00:59:38,990 --> 00:59:42,620
Yeah, l always wondered
who littered the world with those.

795
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:46,150
Where have you been?
l haven't seen you, like, all week.

796
00:59:46,270 --> 00:59:47,760
l've been busy.

797
00:59:47,870 --> 00:59:50,530
l don't want you to feel uncomfortable
around me, okay?

798
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:53,200
l completely respect
your homosexuality,

799
00:59:53,310 --> 00:59:57,680
and l will refrain
from any further untoward advances.

800
00:59:58,410 --> 01:00:01,710
Truth be told,
l've started dating someone.

801
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:03,610
Someone my own age.

802
01:00:03,780 --> 01:00:05,340
What's his name?

803
01:00:07,450 --> 01:00:09,110
Her name

804
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:12,860
is none of your business.

805
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:16,490
l will be staying at her apartment
a couple of nights a week.

806
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:18,820
So does she know you're gay?

807
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:25,300
l don't think that you and l
should be hanging out as much.

808
01:00:26,010 --> 01:00:28,670
Well, that's just... lt's idiotic.

809
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:31,810
l mean, who am l supposed to
hang out with?

810
01:00:31,910 --> 01:00:35,400
l just think that we both need to,
you know, get a life.

811
01:00:36,350 --> 01:00:40,010
My life begins when l set foot
in California next fall.

812
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:44,780
The cab was $9!

813
01:00:45,260 --> 01:00:46,880
l'll pay you back.

814
01:00:49,060 --> 01:00:50,150
Well,

815
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:54,120
-they're publishing my book.
-What?

816
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:56,130
Who the fuck's gonna read that?

817
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:59,200
Bloomberg. l knew it. l so knew it!

818
01:00:59,740 --> 01:01:02,070
Well, when do we...
When are we going to meet with them?

819
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:04,570
You have school.

820
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:07,200
So l'm taking Janet and

821
01:01:08,050 --> 01:01:10,640
flying to New York on Monday.

822
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:18,050
You have school.

823
01:01:25,930 --> 01:01:27,900
So l sort of met somebody.

824
01:01:28,270 --> 01:01:31,030
l was kind of hoping
you could float me some greenbacks

825
01:01:31,140 --> 01:01:33,110
to get my own apartment.

826
01:01:34,010 --> 01:01:37,670
You know, more and more,
l'm getting used to you.

827
01:01:39,250 --> 01:01:40,840
l need you here.

828
01:01:41,780 --> 01:01:44,270
So, no.

829
01:01:49,620 --> 01:01:52,320
There was a twinkle
of humanity in there.

830
01:01:53,890 --> 01:01:56,790
<i>Gonna tell you all a story</i>

831
01:01:56,900 --> 01:01:59,830
<i>About a girl who's just informed me</i>

832
01:01:59,930 --> 01:02:04,770
<i>That all she needs to love me
Is a quiet peaceful day</i>

833
01:02:07,270 --> 01:02:10,440
<i>She don't need no shiny diamonds
Or a fancy car to drive in</i>

834
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:16,610
<i>She just needs me there beside her
On a quiet peaceful day</i>

835
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:26,350
lt's almost 10:00. l need to leave.

836
01:02:29,330 --> 01:02:31,420
Good luck. Knock 'em dead!

837
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:37,000
Does this suit make me look too eager?

838
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:39,870
How can a suit make anyone
look too eager?

839
01:02:44,540 --> 01:02:47,140
-Wish me luck.
-l just did. Go already.

840
01:02:47,250 --> 01:02:49,740
You're starting to make me nervous.

841
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:52,080
Goodbye.

842
01:03:00,230 --> 01:03:03,200
<i>At first I thought it was
the driest piece of shit I'd ever read.</i>

843
01:03:03,530 --> 01:03:04,500
What?

844
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:05,860
Till l got to the third section,

845
01:03:05,970 --> 01:03:08,160
where l noticed a certain
marketable tone,

846
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:11,300
the surly, smarter-than-thou
asshole tone.

847
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:14,140
People love to hate books like this.

848
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:16,210
NPR will attack the book immediately.

849
01:03:16,310 --> 01:03:19,610
<i>And before you know it, you'll be
defending yourself on Charlie Rose.</i>

850
01:03:19,810 --> 01:03:23,410
That's not the point of the book.

851
01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:25,650
l understand your hesitancy,

852
01:03:25,750 --> 01:03:28,450
but when was the last time
a senior editor edited,

853
01:03:28,550 --> 01:03:30,110
actually edited?

854
01:03:31,090 --> 01:03:33,960
We spent the entire staff meeting
last week talking about it.

855
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:36,890
Marketing guys loved it.
Two junior editors loved it.

856
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:40,560
lt's almost like the book itself
is a fucking bully.

857
01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:43,790
<i>You Can't Read.</i>

858
01:03:46,570 --> 01:03:48,060
<i>You Can't Read.</i>

859
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:50,340
Brilliant!

860
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:25,100
Shit.

861
01:04:41,190 --> 01:04:42,420
-Hey.
-Hi.

862
01:04:44,230 --> 01:04:45,820
Well, how'd it go?

863
01:04:47,130 --> 01:04:52,040
Great. They loved me over there.
lt's going to be a very important book.

864
01:04:53,940 --> 01:04:56,310
Well, you seem happy.

865
01:04:56,410 --> 01:04:58,970
Well, wait, wait. Don't open that yet.
What did he say about the book?

866
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:00,240
Well...

867
01:05:00,580 --> 01:05:04,040
They've edited it, significantly.
But it's much better.

868
01:05:04,620 --> 01:05:10,060
lt's intelligent, but very contrary,
powerful and inflammatory. lt's...

869
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:14,590
Well, how much did they edit it?

870
01:05:15,130 --> 01:05:19,960
Well, Penguin has...
They've edited thousands of books,

871
01:05:20,070 --> 01:05:23,930
and there comes a time when
you have to let the experts be experts.

872
01:05:24,370 --> 01:05:26,070
And are you honestly okay
with the changes?

873
01:05:26,170 --> 01:05:31,510
Well, Bloomberg wants
to take us out to dinner.

874
01:05:33,110 --> 01:05:36,050
l thought you and l were going out
for a quiet dinner tonight.

875
01:05:36,650 --> 01:05:40,020
They want to take us out.
lt's... You know. He's my editor.

876
01:05:42,190 --> 01:05:43,920
And l'm your...

877
01:05:45,990 --> 01:05:48,360
l don't know. What am l to you?

878
01:05:50,030 --> 01:05:53,060
Well, for lack of a better term,
you're my girlfriend.

879
01:05:53,170 --> 01:05:55,730
No, what am l to you? Not just a term.

880
01:05:57,840 --> 01:06:02,860
You're everything that a girlfriend is.

881
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:06,850
You can't answer, can you?

882
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:15,190
Please, would you just
get ready for dinner?

883
01:06:15,690 --> 01:06:18,250
You know what?
l actually don't even feel that well.

884
01:06:18,490 --> 01:06:22,950
l couldn't go out tonight anyways.
You should go. l'm gonna be fine.

885
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:33,070
You'd think their parents would
control them.

886
01:06:33,170 --> 01:06:35,000
They've probably been
stuck on a plane for hours.

887
01:06:35,110 --> 01:06:37,770
They should be encouraged
to run around.

888
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:38,900
Your book's not published yet.

889
01:06:39,010 --> 01:06:42,170
You don't have to act
like a complete misanthrope.

890
01:06:46,450 --> 01:06:49,480
What is with you?
You're like a different person.

891
01:06:49,590 --> 01:06:53,250
No, Lawrence, l'm the same person.
l've just noticed a few things.

892
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:54,850
l can't win.

893
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:57,690
Call me a grouch,
l just think that it's wrong

894
01:06:57,800 --> 01:07:01,130
to let kids run around an airport
unsupervised.

895
01:07:01,430 --> 01:07:04,730
When you have children,
you'll understand.

896
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:08,570
This isn't about unsupervised kids
at an airport, and you know it.

897
01:07:08,670 --> 01:07:10,370
Excuse me, sorry.

898
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:20,650
You don't seem interested
in anything other than your book

899
01:07:20,750 --> 01:07:22,880
or becoming head of the department.

900
01:07:22,990 --> 01:07:25,650
l mean, why don't you ask?
Just try asking.

901
01:07:26,490 --> 01:07:30,120
Okay. What the hell's your problem?

902
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,660
l don't want to talk about it right now.

903
01:07:36,570 --> 01:07:37,870
l have it.

904
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:46,700
You don't seem very happy.

905
01:07:46,810 --> 01:07:50,440
l'm not happy. Not even close.

906
01:07:52,380 --> 01:07:58,790
<i>What have I got to offer you</i>

907
01:07:59,930 --> 01:08:02,260
<i>Have I gotten</i>

908
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:08,020
<i>My heart nor my soul
'cause I gave it away</i>

909
01:08:08,270 --> 01:08:11,200
<i>There's a lesson I learned
when the trust is gone</i>

910
01:08:11,370 --> 01:08:13,900
<i>Love is gone</i>

911
01:08:24,020 --> 01:08:26,710
So l put some flowers on Mom's grave.

912
01:08:27,990 --> 01:08:30,960
Like just a dozen or so
pink and white roses.

913
01:08:32,790 --> 01:08:35,850
You kind of owe me $64.

914
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:38,930
The 17th. l'm sorry.

915
01:08:39,060 --> 01:08:40,030
No, it's...

916
01:08:40,170 --> 01:08:43,730
You know, it's not like Mom knew
you weren't there.

917
01:08:43,840 --> 01:08:46,240
Besides, l'm a big girl. l can handle it.

918
01:08:50,810 --> 01:08:52,170
How are you?

919
01:08:54,580 --> 01:08:58,980
Maybe this weekend, you and l
could go ice skating like we used to.

920
01:09:01,550 --> 01:09:02,610
Dad,

921
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:04,150
you just got a huge book deal,

922
01:09:04,260 --> 01:09:06,750
and the head of the department
is yours for the taking,

923
01:09:06,860 --> 01:09:10,350
and everything's kind
of perfect for you, so

924
01:09:10,460 --> 01:09:12,760
don't screw everything up, okay?

925
01:09:14,270 --> 01:09:17,290
<i>You know, l read in Cosmopolitan
that it takes</i>

926
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:21,070
about half the time you date someone
to get over them.

927
01:09:21,170 --> 01:09:24,700
And, what, you've dated Janet
for just a few months?

928
01:09:24,810 --> 01:09:28,750
<i>-You read Cosmopolitan?
-l glance at it.</i>

929
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:33,410
Like, at the supermarket,
if the line's particularly long.

930
01:09:35,750 --> 01:09:37,720
You know that physician,

931
01:09:39,220 --> 01:09:42,990
she's just a rebound relationship,
that's all.

932
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:45,620
A rebound from what?

933
01:09:45,730 --> 01:09:47,160
From Mom.

934
01:10:06,490 --> 01:10:09,280
Lawrence,
congratulations on your book deal.

935
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:10,550
Thank you.

936
01:10:10,660 --> 01:10:14,520
<i>And James' poem being accepted
by the New Yorker.</i>

937
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:16,390
With Lawrence's book it may seem like

938
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:19,260
bringing the other three candidates
to campus is a waste of time.

939
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:22,200
But according to the bylaws,
we have to.

940
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:24,100
What about his recommendation letter?

941
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:27,330
Lawrence, could you
tell us about your book?

942
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:29,000
lt's an examination of critical theory

943
01:10:29,110 --> 01:10:31,510
from the standpoint that
every school of criticism has failed us.

944
01:10:31,610 --> 01:10:34,200
l start out with a brief history
of criticism, then l...

945
01:10:38,780 --> 01:10:41,080
Penguin Group seems to like it.

946
01:10:47,060 --> 01:10:48,690
Shit.

947
01:10:57,340 --> 01:10:59,300
<i>l heard about the New Yorker.</i>

948
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:01,170
Why didn't you tell me
about the poem?

949
01:11:01,270 --> 01:11:02,670
l... l...

950
01:11:02,770 --> 01:11:05,210
-l need to read it.
-You need to read it?

951
01:11:05,310 --> 01:11:06,970
<i>Now that l sold a poem to
the New Yorker,</i>

952
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:09,780
l'm suddenly worthy of your attention?

953
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:14,010
What's wrong with a father wanting
to hear about his son's success?

954
01:11:16,220 --> 01:11:18,210
What are those doing here?

955
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:21,420
-He left those here last night.
-Are you working for him now?

956
01:11:21,530 --> 01:11:23,490
No. l'm not working for him.
He left it here last night.

957
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:26,160
He left his sweater, too. Hold on.

958
01:11:30,540 --> 01:11:32,330
l thought that Chuck
was staying at his girlfriend's.

959
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:34,410
He doesn't have a girlfriend.

960
01:11:34,510 --> 01:11:38,440
He stays here a few nights every week
to get away from you guys.

961
01:11:42,980 --> 01:11:45,680
You have no idea
what's going on, do you?

962
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:54,960
How's your head? Douchebag.

963
01:12:03,070 --> 01:12:07,200
So dinner will be ready at 8:00,
if you're around.

964
01:12:07,310 --> 01:12:09,640
Those jeans look really great.

965
01:12:09,740 --> 01:12:13,700
And they're really snug
in all the right areas.

966
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:18,440
Don't say things like that to me.

967
01:12:18,550 --> 01:12:20,710
-Why, l'm just...
-Just don't.

968
01:12:29,460 --> 01:12:34,130
<i>So what is the lotus?
Homer calls it a ''honey-sweet fruit. ''</i>

969
01:12:34,230 --> 01:12:38,030
For Tennyson, it's not just a drug, is it?

970
01:12:38,140 --> 01:12:40,430
lt symbolizes a desire
for rest and death.

971
01:12:40,540 --> 01:12:42,440
But what does it inspire in them?

972
01:12:42,540 --> 01:12:45,570
They're tired
and they can't take it anymore.

973
01:12:45,680 --> 01:12:48,310
The lotus is about the
possibility of oblivion.

974
01:12:48,410 --> 01:12:51,470
What your CliffsNotes
may not have mentioned is that

975
01:12:51,580 --> 01:12:54,640
the eating of the lotus
occasions a song.

976
01:12:54,750 --> 01:12:55,720
l didn't use CliffsNotes.

977
01:12:55,820 --> 01:12:58,380
You used SparkNotes.
l read them, too.

978
01:12:58,490 --> 01:13:00,620
So where did their singing lead them?

979
01:13:00,830 --> 01:13:04,920
Singing lets them imagine
their way out of their misery.

980
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:10,590
<i>Since they can't go home,
they sing of home</i>

981
01:13:10,700 --> 01:13:13,430
<i>as the place where all the suffering is.</i>

982
01:13:16,170 --> 01:13:18,640
<i>The song becomes the doleful music</i>

983
01:13:18,740 --> 01:13:21,210
<i>of the miserable world
they no longer occupy, then</i>

984
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:28,180
they just sit around listening to it,
drinking nectar and stuff.

985
01:13:47,370 --> 01:13:50,810
Hey, Lawrence, got a minute?
Can l read you something?

986
01:13:52,180 --> 01:13:53,440
''ln all my years of schooling,

987
01:13:53,550 --> 01:13:56,240
''l've never encountered a professor
as deeply passionate about his subject

988
01:13:56,350 --> 01:13:57,710
''as Professor Wetherhold was

989
01:13:57,820 --> 01:14:00,550
''back when l took his Victorian novel
course as a freshman.

990
01:14:00,650 --> 01:14:01,980
''He pushed us hard,
but he believed in us

991
01:14:02,090 --> 01:14:04,750
''and helped us become strong,
close readers and critical writers,

992
01:14:04,860 --> 01:14:06,520
''skills l've brought
to my study of medicine.

993
01:14:06,630 --> 01:14:08,650
''Sincerely, Janet Hartigan, M.D.''

994
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:22,200
Professor Wetherhold,
l have a simple question.

995
01:14:22,770 --> 01:14:26,110
Why do you want to be
head of the English department?

996
01:14:27,850 --> 01:14:29,780
l've been thinking
about that quite a bit lately.

997
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:32,410
As head of the department,
how do you plan on rectifying

998
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:35,950
the systematic subjugation
of women in this institution?

999
01:14:36,050 --> 01:14:39,990
Julia, l haven't even vaguely
considered that, nor do l plan to.

1000
01:14:41,490 --> 01:14:45,660
You know what? None of you like me,
and l don't blame you.

1001
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:48,430
l would make a lousy
head of the department.

1002
01:14:48,730 --> 01:14:52,900
What this department needs is
someone who likes to manage people,

1003
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:54,840
who can make small talk.

1004
01:14:54,940 --> 01:14:56,460
And that's...

1005
01:14:57,080 --> 01:15:00,880
l can't do that.
That's not me. l can't do it.

1006
01:15:04,350 --> 01:15:06,280
Sorry l wasted your time.

1007
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:14,390
l'll just stick to teaching for now.

1008
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:24,300
So where's your girlfriend?
Been hiding out here?

1009
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:26,200
-Bye.
-See you, Chelsea.

1010
01:15:26,300 --> 01:15:27,270
Can we talk?

1011
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:33,910
Everyone in my life is going crazy.

1012
01:15:35,050 --> 01:15:37,210
You're the one that's crazy.

1013
01:15:37,580 --> 01:15:39,350
And socially retarded.

1014
01:15:39,990 --> 01:15:44,010
You're the middle-aged man who was
just hosting a college beer bash.

1015
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:50,550
You know,
Vanessa's becoming an android.

1016
01:15:51,500 --> 01:15:54,590
A scary clone, no friends,

1017
01:15:56,100 --> 01:15:59,300
too scared to be anything else.
Just like you.

1018
01:16:02,710 --> 01:16:04,680
And you constantly
take her for granted.

1019
01:16:04,810 --> 01:16:08,640
l do not take her for granted.
l am continually impressed by her.

1020
01:16:09,580 --> 01:16:12,680
Did you know she was
going to Stanford?

1021
01:16:12,780 --> 01:16:15,050
Early acceptance, last November.

1022
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:19,950
-Why didn't she tell me?
-Why does she have to?

1023
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:23,990
Why don't you ask?

1024
01:16:26,630 --> 01:16:29,360
You drove the hot doctor
out of your life.

1025
01:16:29,470 --> 01:16:32,130
She left me.

1026
01:16:32,240 --> 01:16:36,040
She can't handle my success.
We're just not compatible.

1027
01:16:36,140 --> 01:16:38,510
You have the lQ of a dumb-ass ant.

1028
01:16:44,380 --> 01:16:46,870
But you know what?
Maybe it's not going to be so bad.

1029
01:16:46,990 --> 01:16:48,890
Vanessa's going away in the fall.

1030
01:16:48,990 --> 01:16:52,390
lt'll just be the two of us,
the Wetherhold bachelors.

1031
01:16:53,590 --> 01:16:58,260
Middle-aged, can't get along
with women, should be gay...

1032
01:17:12,580 --> 01:17:13,600
What are you doing here?

1033
01:17:13,850 --> 01:17:16,080
lf you've come to tell me
that l can't go to Stanford,

1034
01:17:16,180 --> 01:17:17,670
then you can just forget it.

1035
01:17:17,780 --> 01:17:19,480
l don't care. l don't care if it's free.

1036
01:17:19,580 --> 01:17:21,980
l'm not going to
the same school as James.

1037
01:17:22,090 --> 01:17:24,750
<i>He sold a poem to the New Yorker.</i>

1038
01:17:24,860 --> 01:17:27,380
Even cretins win the lottery sometimes.

1039
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:38,560
l won't be head of the department.

1040
01:17:39,770 --> 01:17:43,040
-l pulled myself out of the search.
-lnsane.

1041
01:17:43,980 --> 01:17:46,540
-What are you trying to do to me?
-Just relax.

1042
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:48,270
My book,

1043
01:17:48,380 --> 01:17:51,180
that dumbed-down,
gimmicky travesty of scholarship,

1044
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:53,180
will pay for Stanford.

1045
01:17:55,190 --> 01:17:56,520
Satisfied?

1046
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:06,920
What's going on between
you and Chuck?

1047
01:18:09,530 --> 01:18:10,730
Nothing.

1048
01:18:12,740 --> 01:18:15,930
lt's just miscommunication.

1049
01:18:17,410 --> 01:18:20,870
A simple case of middle-aged loser
trying to seduce

1050
01:18:20,980 --> 01:18:25,080
his much younger,
bound-for-success niece.

1051
01:18:28,090 --> 01:18:30,320
l don't think you're very happy,
Vanessa.

1052
01:18:32,190 --> 01:18:34,020
Well, you're not happy,

1053
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:38,790
and you're my role model.

1054
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:57,150
You know what?
l've had a monumentally shitty day.

1055
01:18:57,280 --> 01:18:59,510
You hate me. l get it.
End of discussion.

1056
01:19:07,290 --> 01:19:08,880
l don't hate you.

1057
01:19:11,900 --> 01:19:13,830
You know what? l don't really get it.

1058
01:19:14,300 --> 01:19:17,760
l don't get that you spend the first
few months trying to win me over,

1059
01:19:17,870 --> 01:19:19,200
which you do,

1060
01:19:19,300 --> 01:19:23,600
and then make up some fake girlfriend

1061
01:19:23,710 --> 01:19:25,070
and completely ditch me.

1062
01:19:26,240 --> 01:19:31,710
Well, that's not entirely
the whole story, is it?

1063
01:19:37,620 --> 01:19:39,350
Not really, l guess.

1064
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:50,330
You know, when l moved in,
l thought you were smart and funny.

1065
01:19:51,770 --> 01:19:54,360
l'm sorry that you misunderstood that.

1066
01:20:00,350 --> 01:20:02,840
But l'll let you get back to that.

1067
01:20:03,210 --> 01:20:05,150
What are you gonna do?

1068
01:20:08,690 --> 01:20:13,250
-Go in my room. Do 1,000 pushups.
-Wow.

1069
01:20:15,130 --> 01:20:16,890
What are you going to do
with your life?

1070
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:19,960
Just, you know, sell phone cards?

1071
01:20:20,170 --> 01:20:21,690
Right.

1072
01:20:23,070 --> 01:20:24,900
lt is pretty good money.

1073
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,990
-Sure.
-But l know what you mean.

1074
01:20:30,810 --> 01:20:33,070
You know, l like my life.

1075
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:41,650
Yeah, we're like friends, l guess, right?

1076
01:20:45,690 --> 01:20:47,780
Yeah, we're friends.

1077
01:21:07,450 --> 01:21:09,740
Can you make me
something to eat, friend?

1078
01:21:09,850 --> 01:21:11,940
Order pizza, with the works.

1079
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:33,370
Wake up! l need to run
a few errands before school.

1080
01:21:37,010 --> 01:21:38,070
Wake up.

1081
01:21:39,980 --> 01:21:42,950
<i>If only we loved us like before</i>

1082
01:21:44,350 --> 01:21:47,110
<i>There would be more</i>

1083
01:21:48,090 --> 01:21:51,950
<i>If only the scars would disappear</i>

1084
01:21:52,060 --> 01:21:53,960
<i>Verbal surgery</i>

1085
01:21:54,060 --> 01:21:55,360
Hello.

1086
01:21:56,130 --> 01:22:00,260
<i>If only we could have seen the smoke</i>

1087
01:22:00,370 --> 01:22:02,460
<i>Simple warning</i>

1088
01:22:06,670 --> 01:22:09,070
Hold on, l want... l want that.

1089
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:14,240
May l have a tax receipt?

1090
01:22:15,450 --> 01:22:16,410
There you go.

1091
01:22:16,850 --> 01:22:21,580
<i>Love come back save the day</i>

1092
01:22:29,560 --> 01:22:33,330
Thanks, bro. lt was starting to get
a little cold out here.

1093
01:22:43,640 --> 01:22:48,010
You sat on the right side and
you didn't throw up! Good work!

1094
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:50,680
Pull over, up here.

1095
01:22:50,780 --> 01:22:55,720
Now, remember, four words.
''l'm sorry. l love you.''

1096
01:22:56,320 --> 01:22:57,410
That's five words.

1097
01:22:57,520 --> 01:23:00,580
This is no time to count words,
Professor.

1098
01:23:04,830 --> 01:23:05,800
Hey!

1099
01:23:08,170 --> 01:23:11,760
Don't forget, ''l'm sorry! l love you!''

1100
01:23:16,570 --> 01:23:17,540
What'd he say?

1101
01:23:18,210 --> 01:23:22,010
l love you, too, man!
Hey, where you going!

1102
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:33,590
-May l sit down?
-Sure.

1103
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:38,820
-How are you?
-l'm good. How are you?

1104
01:23:38,930 --> 01:23:40,860
-l'm...
-How's the book coming?

1105
01:23:40,970 --> 01:23:42,660
Thank you for this.

1106
01:23:47,210 --> 01:23:48,830
l didn't write it.

1107
01:23:49,270 --> 01:23:50,970
You should check with Vanessa,
she does good work,

1108
01:23:51,080 --> 01:23:54,510
though the signature's not even close.

1109
01:24:01,190 --> 01:24:03,020
This is humiliating. l'll see you.

1110
01:24:03,390 --> 01:24:07,380
Wait. Wait, wait. Wait.

1111
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:11,020
Listen,

1112
01:24:13,660 --> 01:24:16,930
l haven't had any grand epiphany

1113
01:24:17,030 --> 01:24:19,940
or made any sweeping changes
in my personality

1114
01:24:20,040 --> 01:24:22,800
over the past few weeks.

1115
01:24:23,110 --> 01:24:26,340
l know l'm a miserable asshole, but

1116
01:24:28,610 --> 01:24:30,880
l do have some hope for myself.

1117
01:24:35,090 --> 01:24:36,950
Lawrence, l'm pregnant.

1118
01:24:38,690 --> 01:24:41,850
And according to my calculations,

1119
01:24:41,960 --> 01:24:44,990
this pregnancy is the result
of the first time.

1120
01:24:52,170 --> 01:24:56,300
-Well, why didn't you tell me?
-Because you were being such an ass.

1121
01:24:58,310 --> 01:25:01,970
You were not exactly
a wellspring of emotional information.

1122
01:25:07,450 --> 01:25:10,420
Why would you have a baby with me?

1123
01:25:10,520 --> 01:25:13,980
Because you don't know
how to properly use a condom.

1124
01:25:17,090 --> 01:25:18,690
Message received.

1125
01:25:31,940 --> 01:25:33,930
You're intelligent, right?

1126
01:25:35,010 --> 01:25:38,610
And you're not unattractive.

1127
01:25:43,620 --> 01:25:47,020
l mean, it's not like
it's a total genetic crapshoot.

1128
01:25:50,430 --> 01:25:52,790
Though you do have some deficits.

1129
01:25:56,370 --> 01:25:58,300
But you came here today.

1130
01:26:02,970 --> 01:26:04,870
We can figure this out.

1131
01:26:07,310 --> 01:26:09,010
We're smart people.

1132
01:26:16,350 --> 01:26:18,650
l'm sorry. l love you.

1133
01:26:26,300 --> 01:26:28,860
lt's not up to you. lt's not up to me.

1134
01:26:36,940 --> 01:26:40,710
-Sorry.
-Chuck, you stay, please. Just...

1135
01:26:42,580 --> 01:26:46,680
lt's just that you have options.
And you should be aware of all of them.

1136
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:50,390
Well, you have options, too, Vanessa.

1137
01:26:51,720 --> 01:26:54,160
You can either continue
to be miserable,

1138
01:26:54,260 --> 01:26:56,780
or you can just stop being
angry at everyone

1139
01:26:56,890 --> 01:26:59,490
and accept the way things are.

1140
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:01,460
Allow yourself to live.

1141
01:27:05,100 --> 01:27:08,000
You sound like a stupid
motivational speaker.

1142
01:27:11,910 --> 01:27:13,970
You're not listening to me.

1143
01:27:15,510 --> 01:27:16,950
You're not.

1144
01:27:27,590 --> 01:27:30,080
l am not cleaning any dirty diapers.

1145
01:27:54,050 --> 01:27:55,110
<i>Morning.</i>

1146
01:27:55,220 --> 01:27:58,310
Matthew Arnold, one of the writers
we'll be studying this semester,

1147
01:27:58,420 --> 01:28:03,360
wrote that, ''Culture is the pursuit
of our total perfection,

1148
01:28:03,460 --> 01:28:07,420
''the best which has been
thought and said in the world.''

1149
01:28:09,330 --> 01:28:11,730
Now, my name is
Lawrence Wetherhold.

1150
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:15,030
You may call me Professor
Wetherhold, or Dr. Wetherhold.

1151
01:28:15,140 --> 01:28:20,480
But you may not call me, ''Hey, you,''
or, ''Yo, Teach,'' or, ''Dude,''

1152
01:28:21,010 --> 01:28:22,950
because none of these
terms of address

1153
01:28:23,050 --> 01:28:26,450
could possibly be the prelude
to intelligent comment or question.

1154
01:28:26,820 --> 01:28:29,290
So let's get to know one another.

1155
01:28:29,390 --> 01:28:31,580
Joseph Anderson.

1156
01:28:32,660 --> 01:28:34,720
Joseph, where you from?

1157
01:28:53,110 --> 01:28:57,170
<i>So you got to go,
but you don't know where</i>

1158
01:28:57,310 --> 01:29:01,680
<i>All that you know,
is you can't stay here</i>

1159
01:29:01,990 --> 01:29:06,050
<i>What's left to do, but wish you the best</i>

1160
01:29:06,160 --> 01:29:10,490
<i>In your pursuit of happiness</i>

1161
01:29:10,830 --> 01:29:14,230
<i>You say it's not me, it's just you</i>

1162
01:29:14,330 --> 01:29:19,360
<i>But I'm the only one in the room</i>

1163
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:23,770
<i>Asking myself why you have left</i>

1164
01:29:23,870 --> 01:29:28,310
<i>In your pursuit of happiness</i>

1165
01:29:28,450 --> 01:29:33,650
<i>In your pursuit of happiness</i>

1166
01:29:43,030 --> 01:29:46,590
<i>All the papers read
Happiness is fled</i>

1167
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:50,700
<i>Known accomplice to the sad</i>

1168
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:54,260
<i>I hope you find what you're looking for</i>

1169
01:29:55,010 --> 01:29:59,740
<i>Your piece of mind,
I want nothing more</i>

1170
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:03,780
<i>Somewhere over the rainbow's end</i>

1171
01:30:03,950 --> 01:30:08,210
<i>In your pursuit of happiness</i>

1172
01:30:08,420 --> 01:30:12,690
<i>Starting over again, more or less</i>

1173
01:30:12,790 --> 01:30:17,230
<i>In my pursuit of happiness</i>

1174
01:30:39,220 --> 01:30:44,420
<i>Baby, won't you help me be my best</i>

1175
01:30:49,090 --> 01:30:54,760
<i>Help me find a way back to our nest</i>

1176
01:30:55,870 --> 01:31:00,170
<i>And dreams</i>

1177
01:31:27,300 --> 01:31:31,960
<i>If this were a book
It'd start with a line</i>

1178
01:31:32,470 --> 01:31:38,810
<i>I once knew a man
I was his and he was mine</i>

1179
01:31:39,210 --> 01:31:43,840
<i>So predictable
So confused</i>

1180
01:31:44,050 --> 01:31:50,350
<i>I'm at a loss for words
to explain my mood</i>

1181
01:31:51,960 --> 01:31:58,360
<i>I stitch this bow
into the bottom of my dress</i>

1182
01:32:03,130 --> 01:32:08,870
<i>The one that touches me
directly on my legs</i>

1183
01:32:12,780 --> 01:32:17,080
<i>And I wear that gold ribbon till</i>

1184
01:32:18,320 --> 01:32:23,880
<i>It sits over my heart
And I hold it tight</i>

1185
01:32:25,290 --> 01:32:28,020
<i>And dream</i>
