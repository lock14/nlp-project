Give me your pass.

69
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:36,547
Out of the car.
Come, everyone, out!

70
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,841
<i>It's my camera, baas.</i>

71
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:06,775

00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:08,277
<i>My car, baas.</i>

73
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:11,716
Patrick. Where are you going? Patrick?

74
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:13,284
<i>I'm going home, baas.</i>

75
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:16,954
And where do you get the money for
this nice car and that nice camera?

76
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:19,721
<i>No, baas, I work.
I have a job.</i>

77
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:23,693
<i>I'm a foreman, baas.
I work at Secunda.</i>

78
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,492
Go ahead. Search him.

79
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:28,394
<i>Hold still.
What's wrong with you, huh?</i>

80
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:30,364
Hey, you, come here.

81
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:32,131
Down! Down.

82
00:10:52,284 --> 00:10:55,344
Christ, they
really buggered you up.

83
00:10:58,357 --> 00:11:02,760
So, you leave the country,

84
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:06,359
train in exile with the ANC,

85
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:08,766
<i>come back as a terrorist.</i>

86
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:12,427
<i>Boom! There goes
a railway track.</i>

87
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:18,006
<i>You say you're in a struggle to
make life better for the blacks.</i>

88
00:11:18,744 --> 00:11:23,272

Blacks, whites, everyone.</i>

89

<i>If you succeed,</i>

90
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:28,944

91

The ANC? No.

92
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:36,921
<i>We'll be taking our marching
orders from Moscow, my friend.</i>

93

94
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:46,465
And now, my job

95
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:50,334
is to see to it
that you are hanged.

96
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:58,580
<i>But I don't want to hang you.
I want to help you.</i>

97
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:11,221
Patrick! Security.

98
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:35,079
<i>I'm going to
charge you, boy.</i>

99
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:36,178
<i>Baas, wait.</i>

100
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,246
No, man. You people have
your own toilets over there.

101
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:41,054
<i>Baas, please. There's a
cracked pipe in ash washing.</i>

102
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:43,254
<i>If you hold him,
we're one man short.</i>

103
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:45,488
<i>It's an emergency, Priority A.</i>

104
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:46,622
Just one time.

105
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:47,996
<i>He's a cheeky Kaffir.</i>

106
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:49,694
<i>Yes, he's a cheeky Kaffir.</i>

107
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:52,603
<i>I'm telling you,
you're lucky, boy.</i>

108
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:55,938
<i>Thank you, bass.</i>

109
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:32,100
Up, up.

110
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:35,807
Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up! You, up!

<i>What's your name?</i>

121
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:44,279

00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:49,583
<i>His mother passed away
so he's staying with me now.</i>

123
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:52,822

00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:57,286
<i>That's my boy!</i>

126
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:00,497
Next time,
you must ask for permission.

127
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:01,793
<i>Don't just join in.</i>

128
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:06,634

No fighting!

131
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:15,843
Yes, coach.
Yes, coach.

132
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:17,806

You.

151
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:05,651

152

Not bad.

00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:48,896
<i>It's the suite of my
dreams, Patrick. Hmm?</i>

158
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:50,935
Then get a job
and buy it yourself.

159
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,731
A job?
Is that what you want?

160
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:58,672
Patrick, when people come to
visit and we sit in that room,

161
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,173
<i>I'm ashamed.</i>

00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:18,026
<i>Okay, ja.</i>

167
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:21,592
I got him, Pa.

168
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:24,731
Next time keep your eyes open. Yeah.

169
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:29,797
All right,
pick up the weapon.

170
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:31,969
No, no, no.

171
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:33,611
Always at the target.

172
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,277
Put your weight
on your front foot.

173
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:37,372
<i>I can't.</i>

174
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:59,533
Come on, come on!
Run, run, run!

00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:05,300
<i>I'm going to fetch him.</i>

176
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,847
Maybe at Christmas
when I get my bonus.

177
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,789
<i>Maybe at Christmas
we'll be dead.</i>

178
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:19,651
<i>Hey, don't talk like that.</i>

179
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:21,923
<i>I'm going away.</i>

180
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:24,251
<i>Tell me you'll miss me.</i>

181
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:26,953
Come on.

182
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:30,793
Like a hole in my head.

183
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:43,206
<i>Come with me
down paradise road</i>

184
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:45,908
<i>This way please</i>

185
00:19:45,984 --> 00:19:48,418
<i>I'll carry your load</i>

186
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:52,614
<i>This you must believe</i>

187
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,625
Katie, you may be
in a position, God forbid,

188
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:01,393
when knowing how to shoot
could save your life.

189
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:05,034
<i>Ja. I mean... We've got to
look out for robbers.</i>

190
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:07,467
<i>Susan's mum and dad
were killed in the night.</i>

191
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,404
<i>It's not the robbers
we worry about.</i>

192
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:12,305
<i>It's the terrorists.
The communists.</i>

193
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:14,943
This family is a target.

194
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:16,207
I hate this.

195
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:18,272
All this talk of guns
and killing.

196
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,152
Anna.

197
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:32,724
Enough!

198
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:47,270
Thank you.

199
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:48,438
Patrick.

200
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:51,380
Precious, we beat the Spartans!
We made it to the finals.

201
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:54,018
Secunda Lions.

202
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,111
Forwards ever.
Backwards never.

203
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:59,180
<i>Oh, Precious, phone the plant
for me. Tell them I'm sick.</i>

204
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,585
<i>Patrick? Who's that?</i>

205
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:05,653
<i>I heard a girl there,
Patrick. Who is that?</i>

206
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:08,222
<i>Precious, it's a woman
waiting to use the phone.</i>

207
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,358
I am warning you!

208
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:10,992
Precious,
stop your nonsense.

209
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:13,196
<i>Phone Secunda.
Tell them I'm sick.</i>

210
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:15,163
<i>Precious?</i>

211
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:20,504
Precious? Precious?

212
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:22,206
Pass the ball!

213
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:24,508
Pass! Sixpence, pass!

214
00:21:30,822 --> 00:21:32,722
Go, Sixpence, go!

215
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:35,655
Go, Sixpence! Go!

216
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:52,938
Goal!

217
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:52,494
No.

218
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:11,880
No.

219
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:18,122
My father left when I was 10.

220
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:22,557
And I never saw him again.

221
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:26,796
<i>Its better he doesn't know.</i>

222
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,805
Try to
visit again soon.

223
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,006
Please.

224
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:38,742
<i>It's hard.</i>

225
00:23:39,851 --> 00:23:42,046
<i>I'll come when I can.</i>

226
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:03,734
<i>Oh, wow!
What's that?</i>

227
00:24:03,842 --> 00:24:06,606
<i>Fire, man! It's fire!
Shit, man!</i>

228
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:07,836
Watch your mouth.

229
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:09,437
<i>I hope it's the school.</i>

230
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:11,380
<i>It's Secunda.</i>

231
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:17,080
<i>Earlier this week, Minister
of Police, Mr. Louis le Grange,</i>

232
00:24:17,155 --> 00:24:19,419
<i>warned that South Africa is in a
virtual state of war... Is it safe?</i>

233
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,791
Day or night,
the plant keeps going.

234
00:24:24,362 --> 00:24:25,351
What?

235
00:24:30,368 --> 00:24:31,630
Bye-bye.

236
00:24:31,736 --> 00:24:32,725
Bye.

237
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:36,032
<i>The plant here in Secunda
uses a revolutionary technique</i>

238
00:24:36,107 --> 00:24:38,940
<i>to convert coal into
oil and petrol. Bye, Ma.</i>

239
00:24:39,277 --> 00:24:42,474
<i>Almost half of South Africa's
cars use the fuel</i>

240
00:24:42,547 --> 00:24:44,640
<i>processed in this
particular plant.</i>

241
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,277
<i>Perhaps it's too early
to speculate,</i>

242
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:50,081
<i>but if this is confirmed
as a terrorist attack</i>

243
00:24:50,188 --> 00:24:52,418
<i>it'll be
the largest sabotage...</i>

244
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:00,931
Come on, arms up.

245
00:25:51,816 --> 00:25:53,807
<i>You think you're
so clever, huh?</i>

246
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:55,819
You and your
bloody terrorists!

247
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:19,938
<i>...two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight,</i>

248
00:26:20,011 --> 00:26:23,469
nine, ten, eleven, twelve,
thirteen, fourteen.

249
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:33,922
I think it makes nine.

250
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:35,184
Okay. Count.

251
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:39,458
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

252
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:51,800
<i>One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten...</i>

253
00:26:56,081 --> 00:26:57,241
<i>I've done nothing!</i>

254
00:26:57,315 --> 00:26:58,304
Come on.

255
00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:04,654
<i>Chamusso's
in the checked shirt.</i>

256
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:08,616
Patrick Chamusso?
Yes.

257
00:27:08,693 --> 00:27:11,184
Yes, what do you want from me?

258
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:14,523
Let him go!
Let him go!

259
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:16,291
What are you doing?

260
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:20,428
Daddy! Take your
hands off my daddy!

261
00:27:20,505 --> 00:27:22,769
Get away from him!
Daddy!

262
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:26,040
Daddy.
Let me go!

263
00:27:26,511 --> 00:27:28,604
Patrick! Let me go!

264
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:30,779
Patrick!

265
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:33,044
Precious! Let her go.

266
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:34,779
Precious!

267
00:27:34,853 --> 00:27:36,184
Patrick!

268
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:50,260
Patrick.

269
00:27:56,107 --> 00:27:58,337
<i>I'm very sorry,
Mrs. Chamusso.</i>

270
00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:02,212
We have to ask your
husband some questions.

271
00:28:26,571 --> 00:28:28,471
I wanna be your friend.

272
00:28:28,673 --> 00:28:30,664
I want to be your friend.

273
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,619
Who is your contact?

274
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:46,515
<i>I'm asking you a question now,
Patrick. Look at me in the eyes.</i>

275
00:28:47,258 --> 00:28:48,919
I said, look at me!

276
00:28:51,763 --> 00:28:54,391
<i>Are you a member of the ANC?
It's simple.</i>

277
00:28:54,532 --> 00:28:56,693
You think a communist
is a good thing?

278
00:30:14,846 --> 00:30:17,041
What the hell
have you done to him?

279
00:30:23,454 --> 00:30:25,354
Here. Sit up.

280
00:30:26,791 --> 00:30:28,224
Get up.

281
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:33,053
<i>It's water.</i>

282
00:30:34,899 --> 00:30:36,025
Slowly.

283
00:30:37,235 --> 00:30:40,602
Slowly. Slowly.

284
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:48,771
I want a doctor
to take a look at him.

285
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,469
Now!

286
00:31:01,926 --> 00:31:02,915
Here.

287
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:26,480
<i>Why won't they
let him go, Zuko?</i>

288
00:31:26,751 --> 00:31:28,480
Why are they
still holding him?

289
00:31:29,687 --> 00:31:32,850
<i>And Johnny, too.
I don't know.</i>

290
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:35,582
<i>And that night he
wasn't even in Secunda.</i>

291
00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:38,458
<i>You know him, Zuko,
he's not into politics.</i>

292
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:42,260
<i>His family, his work, his
football. That's Patrick's life.</i>

293
00:31:43,768 --> 00:31:45,998
I must go to Joburg
and find a lawyer.

294
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:47,329
<i>That's what I must do.</i>

295
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:49,270
<i>He doesn't have
the right a lawyer.</i>

296
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,534
Only if they charge him.

297
00:31:50,608 --> 00:31:52,007
Charge him with what?

298
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:55,778
At the moment, they can hold
him as long as they want.

299
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:57,314
What am I supposed to do?

300
00:31:59,384 --> 00:32:01,579
What am I
supposed to do now?

301
00:32:03,621 --> 00:32:05,418
I want to know who you are.

302
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:11,189
<i>When I look at a man
I don't see a terrorist.</i>

303
00:32:11,963 --> 00:32:13,726
I see a human being.

304
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,859
I told you 100 times.

305
00:32:17,368 --> 00:32:20,098
<i>I'm innocent.
I am not ANC.</i>

306
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:24,837
<i>How many men
in your maintenance team?</i>

307
00:32:26,344 --> 00:32:28,437
<i>A foreman
and two other men.</i>

308
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:33,516
You, Zuko September,
Johnny Piliso.

309
00:32:34,352 --> 00:32:35,944
Who collects the vehicles?

310
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,510
Who signs for the keys?

311
00:32:41,092 --> 00:32:42,855
The foreman on the shift.

312
00:32:42,927 --> 00:32:46,488
That night,
that would be you.

313
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:51,727
<i>I told you, I wasn't there.
I was sick.</i>

314
00:32:52,437 --> 00:32:53,699
Did you see a doctor?

315
00:32:53,871 --> 00:32:54,929
Yes.

316
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,564
Got a sick note?

317
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:59,075
Yes. Yes.

318
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:05,680
<i>The doctor's note
was forged, Patrick.</i>

319
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:08,846
We know that.

320
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:16,885
You are lying.

321
00:33:21,366 --> 00:33:23,766
<i>I'm a coach
for Secunda Lions.</i>

322
00:33:27,605 --> 00:33:31,268
Township kids. We were
in the playoffs at Ermelo.

323
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:34,844
We stayed an extra day.

324
00:33:36,214 --> 00:33:38,614
I have no holiday left
this year.

325
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:41,785
<i>And I don't want to
lose my job.</i>

326
00:34:09,147 --> 00:34:11,513
<i>It's good what
Patrick does with those boys.</i>

327
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:14,317
Giving them a focus.
Keeping them off the streets.

328
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:16,381
Good man.

329
00:34:20,825 --> 00:34:26,229
So, that day, he takes the
boys to the playoffs in Ermelo.

330
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:30,327
They win. 2-1.

331
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:34,565
And then he drives somewhere.

332
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:37,697
Takes off in the Kombi.

333
00:34:39,977 --> 00:34:41,501
Do you know where he went?

334
00:34:43,047 --> 00:34:44,344
Who he met?

335
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:47,544
In the middle of the night?

336
00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:15,640
Patrick.

337
00:35:17,348 --> 00:35:20,078
<i>It's Sunday.
Day of rest.</i>

338
00:35:21,018 --> 00:35:22,508
<i>Let's get you cleaned up.</i>

339
00:35:22,854 --> 00:35:24,253
Take a drive.

340
00:35:27,325 --> 00:35:31,694
Between you and me, Patrick,
apartheid cannot last.

341
00:35:33,064 --> 00:35:35,862
Twenty-five million blacks.

342
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:37,998
Three million white people.

343
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:40,234
We are the underdogs.

344
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:44,205
We are the ones under attack.

345
00:35:54,051 --> 00:35:55,518
Amen.
Amen.

346
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,088
<i>I'm starving.</i>

347
00:36:07,031 --> 00:36:09,295
Maybe Patrick would like
some gravy please, Elsie.

348
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,493
Cool drink, Mom?
Thank you.

349
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,105
<i>Patrick, don't tell me.
Let me guess.</i>

350
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,744
<i>No, I'm Shangaan.</i>

351
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:26,975
Oh.

352
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:29,584
I usually can tell.

353
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:39,521
Patrick also has
daughters. Two.

354
00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:43,961
Is it? How old?

355
00:36:45,002 --> 00:36:46,902
<i>Albertina, she's eight.</i>

356
00:36:47,271 --> 00:36:49,000
<i>Lindiwe, she's six.</i>

357
00:36:50,074 --> 00:36:51,837
<i>How sweet.
That's the best age.</i>

358
00:36:55,313 --> 00:36:59,010
<i>The little one, she's naughty.</i>

359
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:01,309
She is very bad.

360
00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:06,256
Patrick has a beautiful wife.

361
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:12,255
<i>Miss Highveld Africa...</i>

362
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:14,924
1972?

363
00:37:16,467 --> 00:37:17,525
Yes.

364
00:37:19,103 --> 00:37:20,934
She likes nice things.

365
00:37:21,272 --> 00:37:24,332
Nice clothes.
Nice furniture.

366
00:37:25,543 --> 00:37:27,443
Is there something
wrong with that?

367
00:37:28,479 --> 00:37:30,140
No. Nothing wrong.

368
00:37:32,883 --> 00:37:34,407
<i>She's got class, man.</i>

369
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:37,349
She does.

370
00:37:57,575 --> 00:37:59,338
Sing along, Patrick.

371
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:01,745
You know the words, yeah?

372
00:38:19,096 --> 00:38:20,654
Were you singing, Patrick?

373
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:24,228
Celebrating
the terrorist attacks?

374
00:38:24,735 --> 00:38:26,965
Ask anybody in Secunda

375
00:38:28,172 --> 00:38:31,608
and they will you that Patrick
Chamusso is not a terrorist.

376
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:33,476
They would laugh at you.

377
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:36,810
I saw your boys.

378
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:39,248
I watched them play.

379
00:38:41,118 --> 00:38:43,018
That one kid. Sixpence?

380
00:38:44,689 --> 00:38:46,714
<i>He's really good, huh?</i>

381
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:52,493
After supper you dropped the
boys off at the school in Ermelo.

382
00:38:53,097 --> 00:38:54,894
Then you took off
somewhere.

383
00:38:55,366 --> 00:38:57,561
In the morning you were
late picking them up.

384
00:38:58,969 --> 00:39:00,436
<i>That's what they said.</i>

385
00:39:01,706 --> 00:39:04,334
We checked the mileage
on the vehicle.

386
00:39:05,309 --> 00:39:08,210
That tells us
you drove to the plant.

387
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,143
You fixed the mines.

388
00:39:10,214 --> 00:39:11,238
No.

389
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:13,980
Then where were you
that night, Patrick?

390
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:19,948
When you dropped the boys off,
where did you go?

391
00:39:27,898 --> 00:39:29,388
<i>He's pissed off now.</i>

392
00:40:04,168 --> 00:40:05,499
Watch this, Mommy.

393
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:09,164
I used to do that
when I was a girl.

394
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,839
You show me.

395
00:40:15,112 --> 00:40:16,977
<i>There's another woman.</i>

396
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:21,177
Not far from here.

397
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:24,220
<i>That's where I was.</i>

398
00:40:25,389 --> 00:40:26,378
Yes?

399
00:40:29,794 --> 00:40:31,318
I love my wife.

400
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:44,233
<i>You're lying.</i>

401
00:40:44,642 --> 00:40:46,166
Nice try, Patrick.

402
00:41:12,736 --> 00:41:16,297
Did you know your friend
Johnny had a weak heart?

403
00:42:44,595 --> 00:42:46,222
<i>Is somebody here?</i>

404
00:42:48,799 --> 00:42:50,426
<i>Is somebody here?</i>

405
00:42:55,973 --> 00:42:57,440
Hello.

406
00:42:58,642 --> 00:42:59,802
<i>Hello?</i>

407
00:43:20,497 --> 00:43:21,657
Precious!

408
00:43:23,901 --> 00:43:25,835
What have they done to you?

409
00:43:28,539 --> 00:43:30,063
What have they done to you?

410
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:39,943
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

411
00:43:49,693 --> 00:43:50,682
<i>Precious.</i>

412
00:43:52,096 --> 00:43:53,825
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

413
00:43:54,999 --> 00:43:56,489
Nic Vos!

414
00:43:59,169 --> 00:44:01,967
I am talking to you, Nic Vos!

415
00:44:02,906 --> 00:44:06,899
I will stand up in court
and this is what I will say.

416
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:12,244
After the game, I fetched the
boys to the school in Ermelo.

417
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:15,111
I went to Secunda.

418
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:18,417
After that I opened
the east perimeter fence.

419
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:19,786
Patrick, stop!

420
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:21,380
No one saw me.

421
00:44:22,459 --> 00:44:24,950
I was there ten minutes
and I was gone.

422
00:44:25,462 --> 00:44:28,295
You can do anything
you want to do with me.

423
00:44:28,399 --> 00:44:31,061
But you must release my wife!

424
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:37,773
What kind of man are you who
does these things to a woman?

425
00:44:40,911 --> 00:44:42,572
What kind of man are you?

426
00:44:50,387 --> 00:44:51,479
Pray.

427
00:45:02,666 --> 00:45:04,861
<i>I am talking to you,
Nic Vos. Here it is.</i>

428
00:45:05,569 --> 00:45:09,869
<i>I will stand up in court and this
is what I will say. I let him go.</i>

429
00:45:11,141 --> 00:45:13,575
<i>After the game,
I fetched the boys.</i>

430
00:45:13,644 --> 00:45:15,339
<i>I took the boys
to the school in Ermelo.</i>

431
00:45:15,412 --> 00:45:17,437
<i>He didn't do it.
I let him go.</i>

432
00:45:17,848 --> 00:45:20,078
He confessed on tape.

433
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:22,345
Confessed? To what?

434
00:45:22,853 --> 00:45:24,582
That he cut a hole
in the fence?

435
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:28,889
They got in with a key.
You know that.

436
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:32,154
<i>He said he did it. Okay?
That's good enough for me.</i>

437
00:45:32,262 --> 00:45:34,492
So we lie
to get a conviction.

438
00:45:35,766 --> 00:45:37,165
We hang him.

439
00:45:37,801 --> 00:45:41,032
<i>We lock him in jail for the rest of
his life for something he didn't do.</i>

440
00:45:41,171 --> 00:45:43,901
<i>In the meantime, there's a
terrorist loose on the ground.</i>

441
00:45:44,608 --> 00:45:46,439
What the hell is
the point in that?

442
00:45:47,711 --> 00:45:51,238
Our job is
to find the terrorists.

443
00:46:08,398 --> 00:46:09,387
Daddy!

444
00:46:50,107 --> 00:46:52,234
That night I was in Evander.

445
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:56,772
You told me
it was finished.

446
00:46:57,347 --> 00:46:59,508
You told me 10 times,
you said it was finished.

447
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:00,743
<i>It's true. It is finished.</i>

448
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:02,445
So why did you
go to her house?

449
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:11,487
I will make this right.

450
00:47:11,962 --> 00:47:14,362
I promise
I will make this right.

451
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:49,860
<i>Comrades and compatriots,
duty calls.</i>

452
00:47:49,967 --> 00:47:52,060
<i>The battle lines are drawn.</i>

453
00:47:52,269 --> 00:47:55,898
<i>The African National Congress
commands and urges all of us</i>

454
00:47:56,173 --> 00:47:59,939
<i>to act for unity and as one
to engage the enemy.</i>

455
00:48:00,077 --> 00:48:02,341
<i>If united, there's action.</i>

456
00:48:02,913 --> 00:48:04,574
<i>The time has come.</i>

457
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:07,043
<i>This government of slavery.</i>

458
00:48:07,184 --> 00:48:09,414
<i>This government of oppression.</i>

459
00:48:09,686 --> 00:48:14,055
<i>This apartheid monster
must be removed from power.</i>

460
00:48:14,124 --> 00:48:16,558
<i>They will never stop the rage.</i>

461
00:48:16,627 --> 00:48:19,619
<i>The arrests, the beatings,
the killings.</i>

462
00:48:19,696 --> 00:48:22,688
<i>Until the day
we end white rule.</i>

463
00:48:22,766 --> 00:48:25,826
<i>Let this be the year of the
most powerful offensive</i>

464
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:28,030
<i>against the apartheid regime.</i>

465
00:48:28,105 --> 00:48:31,506
<i>Let this be the year
of the great unity action.</i>

466
00:48:31,842 --> 00:48:35,039
<i>Let this be the year
of the great leap forward</i>

467
00:48:35,112 --> 00:48:37,410
<i>to the threshold of victory.</i>

468
00:48:44,187 --> 00:48:48,021
OBADl: Have you told anyone that
you were coming to Mozambique?

469
00:48:48,392 --> 00:48:50,724
No.
Not even my family.

470
00:48:51,028 --> 00:48:52,859
Once you cross that fence.

471
00:48:52,963 --> 00:48:56,057
Once you decide to fight back,
everything is different.

472
00:48:57,968 --> 00:49:00,869
You cannot contact anyone
on the other side.

473
00:49:01,471 --> 00:49:03,837
That means no phone calls,
no letters.

474
00:49:04,641 --> 00:49:07,166
You may never see
your family again.

475
00:49:08,845 --> 00:49:10,403
Do you still wanna go on?

476
00:49:10,747 --> 00:49:12,612
They have
killed my friend,

477
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:15,812
tortured my wife
for nothing.

478
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:19,416
Yes, I want to go on.

479
00:49:21,091 --> 00:49:22,615
Yes. I want to go on.

480
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:31,127
<i>When's Daddy coming back?</i>

481
00:49:33,003 --> 00:49:34,265
<i>He'll let us know.</i>

482
00:49:37,074 --> 00:49:39,702
<i>You were asleep.
He didn't want to wake you.</i>

483
00:49:39,876 --> 00:49:42,902
Girls, girls, stop asking
so many questions.

484
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:46,375
Just eat up.

485
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:06,230
Patrick.

486
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:45,029
OBADl: Fall in, man!

487
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:46,467
I know you.

488
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:51,304
Each one of you,
I know who you are!

489
00:51:57,314 --> 00:51:58,906
I know why you are here.

490
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:00,344
Commander.

491
00:52:04,988 --> 00:52:06,250
Murder the Boers.

492
00:52:11,995 --> 00:52:14,293
<i>OBADl: We don't kill
indiscriminately.</i>

493
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:16,792
<i>OBADl: We're fighting
for freedom, comrades.</i>

494
00:52:16,867 --> 00:52:20,325
South Africa belongs
to all who live in it!

495
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:25,032
We train you, we arm you,
we send you back.

496
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:26,999
The Boers, they capture you.

497
00:52:27,611 --> 00:52:29,875
Will you be able
to hold steadfast?

498
00:52:31,414 --> 00:52:33,006
Or will you begin to sing?

499
00:52:33,083 --> 00:52:35,244
<i>We're ice-cool, Comrade.
We're from Soweto.</i>

500
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:40,278
<i>I'm from Soweto, Comrade. But if they
catch me, I will shit in my pants.</i>

501
00:52:45,762 --> 00:52:48,390
The Boers, they kill you.

502
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:50,930
Are you ready to die?

503
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:54,227
Are you ready to die?

504
00:52:54,304 --> 00:52:56,602
Yes, Commander!
Are you ready to die?

505
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:58,834
Yes, Commander.
Are you ready to die?

506
00:52:58,909 --> 00:53:01,571
Yes, Commander!
Are you ready to die?

507
00:53:02,045 --> 00:53:14,851
Yes, Commander!
Are you ready to die?

508
00:53:14,925 --> 00:53:17,951
Yes, Commander! Yes,
Commander! Yes, Commander!

509
00:53:20,664 --> 00:53:23,656
<i>There's the office here.
Where's the entrance?</i>

510
00:53:23,733 --> 00:53:26,600
The entrance is here
on Avenida Julius Nyerere.

511
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:28,695
Where do the people
from the office stay?

512
00:53:28,772 --> 00:53:30,364
<i>There's a house.</i>

513
00:53:31,575 --> 00:53:33,270
Here.
How many?

514
00:53:33,777 --> 00:53:35,472
Two to three cadres.

515
00:53:36,179 --> 00:53:38,147
Comrade J.S.

516
00:53:39,482 --> 00:53:41,677
<i>No, we don't know
where he stays.</i>

517
00:53:41,751 --> 00:53:43,582
Zuma? Tambo?

518
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:46,189
Sir, these people,
they move around.

519
00:53:46,256 --> 00:53:47,985
They sleep
in different places.

520
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:50,356
<i>One night there, the
other night... Betsy.</i>

521
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:54,795
Pete My Baby?

522
00:53:57,167 --> 00:53:58,600
Where do they stay?

523
00:54:05,141 --> 00:54:07,439
<i>In this...
What floor are they on?</i>

524
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:08,977
<i>Where's the arms cache?</i>

525
00:54:09,446 --> 00:54:10,936
<i>Don't shake your head at me.</i>

526
00:54:12,115 --> 00:54:14,675
When did these come in?
Yesterday.

527
00:54:19,823 --> 00:54:21,586
Bye.
Bye-bye.

528
00:54:23,893 --> 00:54:25,622
Bye, mum.
Bye.

529
00:54:25,695 --> 00:54:27,356
Bye-bye. See you, Mum.

530
00:54:28,398 --> 00:54:30,127
Bye!
Bye-bye!

531
00:54:32,002 --> 00:54:33,299
Bye-bye!

532
00:54:46,883 --> 00:54:48,180
Going back to work?

533
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:51,045
Give you a lift.

534
00:54:52,922 --> 00:54:54,583
<i>You've lost
your house now.</i>

535
00:54:55,592 --> 00:54:57,219
Living in a one-room shack.

536
00:54:58,194 --> 00:54:59,855
No money coming in.

537
00:55:02,065 --> 00:55:03,862
Maybe I can help you,
Precious.

538
00:55:04,768 --> 00:55:06,099
Use my influence.

539
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:08,668
Find you somewhere
better to live.

540
00:55:10,006 --> 00:55:14,102
When you hear from
Patrick, you let me know.

541
00:55:15,412 --> 00:55:17,039
<i>You must ask yourself...</i>

542
00:55:18,615 --> 00:55:20,139
<i>"Where is he?"</i>

543
00:55:22,285 --> 00:55:23,752
<i>"Who is he with now?"</i>

544
00:55:24,454 --> 00:55:26,354
<i>"Where does he sleep
at night?"</i>

545
00:55:56,286 --> 00:55:57,651
Yeah.

546
00:56:03,326 --> 00:56:05,351
So many days,

547
00:56:05,562 --> 00:56:07,553
so many weeks pass

548
00:56:08,398 --> 00:56:14,337
sitting around here
thinking about my family.

549
00:56:18,174 --> 00:56:19,573
Why I came here?

550
00:56:21,778 --> 00:56:23,143
<i>Obrigado.</i>

551
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:25,207
OBADl:
On all the anniversaries,

552
00:56:25,615 --> 00:56:28,584
my marriage, the birthdays,

553
00:56:29,786 --> 00:56:34,485
in my mind, I see my wife and my kids.

554
00:56:35,325 --> 00:56:38,852
And I put myself in that
place, there with them.

555
00:56:39,462 --> 00:56:42,260
And I imagine
what it will be like

556
00:56:42,332 --> 00:56:45,392
when South Africa is free
and I am home again.

557
00:56:46,770 --> 00:56:50,365
And then my heart starts
to beat faster.

558
00:57:00,383 --> 00:57:01,748
<i>Quanto?</i>

559
00:57:26,142 --> 00:57:27,803
Attention, comrades.

560
00:57:27,877 --> 00:57:29,208
Attention!

561
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:32,544
<i>There's Frelimo outside to
check our papers, so follow me.</i>

562
00:57:32,615 --> 00:57:34,742
<i>Comrade, I don't have papers.</i>

563
00:57:34,818 --> 00:57:36,080
Me, too.

564
00:57:36,152 --> 00:57:37,949
Okay, the two of you,
you stay here.

565
00:57:41,891 --> 00:57:43,381
OBADl: Come on, all of you.

566
00:57:49,732 --> 00:57:52,929
<i>Could you be loved</i>

567
00:57:54,537 --> 00:57:57,131
<i>And be loved</i>

568
00:59:04,173 --> 00:59:05,663
Go! Go! Go!

569
00:59:13,650 --> 00:59:16,813
Obadi? Obadi.

570
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:20,018
Hold on.

571
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:17,298
If you would
have planned it better

572
01:02:17,767 --> 01:02:20,201
you could have blown up
the whole plant.

573
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:25,671
<i>There's different security
there now.</i>

574
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:28,302
Look out posts here, here,
Mmm-hmm.

575
01:02:28,377 --> 01:02:31,107
<i>and here,
there's a new water pump.</i>

576
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:33,748
The water in there
is for chemical fires.

577
01:02:33,816 --> 01:02:35,579
You must go there first.

578
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:40,912
The alarm. Everybody leaves.

579
01:02:41,124 --> 01:02:43,888
The ground is cleared.
The workers are safe.

580
01:02:44,227 --> 01:02:46,388
<i>There's no water
to put out chemical fires.</i>

581
01:02:47,864 --> 01:02:50,833
The second bomb goes here
at the core reactor.

582
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:53,231
Boom, boom, boom.

583
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:55,567
The whole plant is gone.

584
01:02:55,638 --> 01:02:56,969
Hot stuff.

585
01:02:57,874 --> 01:02:59,603
Mr. Hotstuff.

586
01:03:00,643 --> 01:03:03,305
<i>They stole
our brothers in Africa.</i>

587
01:03:03,379 --> 01:03:05,643
<i>Run, oppressor, run</i>

588
01:03:05,715 --> 01:03:07,842
<i>All are freedom fighters.</i>

589
01:03:07,917 --> 01:03:13,116
<i>In South Africa, Mozambique,
Angola and Rhodesia.</i>

590
01:03:14,257 --> 01:03:16,225
<i>Let them be strengthened.</i>

591
01:03:19,328 --> 01:03:22,729
<i>Run out
of black-man's land</i>

592
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:24,733
This is the fight
for liberation.

593
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:28,601
<i>There were over forty
thousand of us in Angola,</i>

594
01:03:28,671 --> 01:03:31,970
<i>training to go home
and liberate our country.</i>

595
01:03:32,308 --> 01:03:35,106
<i>We were getting ready
for secret missions,</i>

596
01:03:36,579 --> 01:03:39,309
<i>so we knew each other
by code names.</i>

597
01:03:40,316 --> 01:03:44,377
<i>My friend from Mozambique had
already been given his name.</i>

598
01:03:44,587 --> 01:03:45,986
<i>Pete My Baby.</i>

599
01:03:46,055 --> 01:03:48,819
We shall be housed
with security and comfort.

600
01:03:48,891 --> 01:03:54,329
<i>But me, Patrick Chamusso,
now I became Hotstuff.</i>

601
01:04:03,606 --> 01:04:06,905
<i>Run out of black-man's land</i>

602
01:04:13,316 --> 01:04:15,216
<i>Oh, yeah, now, now</i>

603
01:04:15,284 --> 01:04:18,879
<i>Run out of black-man's land</i>

604
01:04:18,955 --> 01:04:20,149
<i>Sing it one more time</i>

605
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:24,057
<i>Run, oppressor, run</i>

606
01:04:26,162 --> 01:04:29,529
<i>Run out of black-man land</i>

607
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:07,668
<i>Sorry, sir. Latest informer's
reports from Swaziland.</i>

608
01:05:07,870 --> 01:05:09,064
<i>Dankie.</i>

609
01:05:12,675 --> 01:05:17,305
And here he is again
and again.

610
01:05:18,381 --> 01:05:19,712
And again.

611
01:05:24,654 --> 01:05:26,212
Limpet mines.

612
01:05:26,289 --> 01:05:29,053
Red splint is inserted here.

613
01:05:30,693 --> 01:05:33,662
The fuse is inserted here.

614
01:05:35,364 --> 01:05:37,059
You pull the safety pin out.

615
01:05:37,967 --> 01:05:42,563
After 15 minutes,
this circle here will be red.

616
01:05:42,638 --> 01:05:44,265
And the bomb will explode.

617
01:05:44,607 --> 01:05:45,869
Yes.

618
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:00,114
How long to empty the plant
after the first explosion?

619
01:06:00,189 --> 01:06:02,020
Twelve minutes.
Maybe less.

620
01:06:02,224 --> 01:06:05,022
Set the mines for 15 minutes,
just to make sure.

621
01:06:05,094 --> 01:06:06,823
No one must die.

622
01:06:06,996 --> 01:06:08,190
I know.

623
01:06:19,141 --> 01:06:20,403
Okay.

624
01:06:21,110 --> 01:06:22,873
<i>One, two...</i>

625
01:06:23,779 --> 01:06:26,976
From now on your name
is James Mabuso.

626
01:06:27,350 --> 01:06:29,113
James Mabuso.

627
01:06:29,485 --> 01:06:32,215
Remember, when you get to Secunda,

628
01:06:32,288 --> 01:06:36,315
keep away from your family.
Keep away from your wife.

629
01:06:46,936 --> 01:06:49,166
Reason for entering
South Africa?

630
01:06:49,238 --> 01:06:52,105
<i>I'm going to Florida
to buy parts for my business.</i>

631
01:06:59,582 --> 01:07:01,049
Please, sit down.

632
01:07:14,663 --> 01:07:15,994
Go.

633
01:07:21,837 --> 01:07:23,327
Mr. Mabuso.

634
01:07:27,910 --> 01:07:29,537
<i>I'll give you 14 days.</i>

635
01:07:31,514 --> 01:07:33,038
Thanks.

636
01:07:53,436 --> 01:07:54,835
<i>He's heading west.</i>

637
01:07:55,304 --> 01:07:57,499
Probably rendezvous
in Secunda area.

638
01:08:43,319 --> 01:08:44,809
Slowing down.

639
01:08:47,556 --> 01:08:48,989
Slowing down.

640
01:08:51,427 --> 01:08:53,327
Stopped. Go! Go!

641
01:09:25,528 --> 01:09:28,395
Stop! Stop! Stop!

642
01:11:01,357 --> 01:11:03,291
I thought you were a ghost,
man.

643
01:11:05,995 --> 01:11:07,690
Precious, my kids.

644
01:11:07,763 --> 01:11:09,128
<i>How's my family?</i>

645
01:11:10,633 --> 01:11:12,658
They stay on Fifth Street now.

646
01:11:12,735 --> 01:11:15,033
The company took back
the house.

647
01:11:15,170 --> 01:11:17,764
<i>Precious is in Witbank.
She's got a job.</i>

648
01:11:18,941 --> 01:11:21,876
<i>Don't worry.
I'm watching them.</i>

649
01:11:23,846 --> 01:11:26,246
Thank you.
Hmm.

650
01:12:06,588 --> 01:12:08,215
My husband
was the caretaker,

651
01:12:08,290 --> 01:12:10,224
<i>but they've closed
the mine now.</i>

652
01:12:10,893 --> 01:12:12,554
<i>They didn't
give me a pension.</i>

653
01:12:14,029 --> 01:12:15,758
<i>I'm not supposed
to rent out rooms</i>

654
01:12:15,831 --> 01:12:17,389
but I need the money.

655
01:12:21,337 --> 01:12:24,363
<i>Five rand a week. And I'II...
I'll cook for you also.</i>

656
01:12:43,759 --> 01:12:46,057
Out of the way! Out of
the way! Out of the way!

657
01:12:52,167 --> 01:12:55,227
<i>He's a terrorist.
Pete My Baby.</i>

658
01:12:59,441 --> 01:13:00,999
I killed him, Dad.

659
01:13:01,510 --> 01:13:03,671
<i>All right. It's all right.
Daddy's here.</i>

660
01:13:03,746 --> 01:13:06,579
I shot him, Dad.
He just came through.

661
01:13:06,648 --> 01:13:09,617
He had a gun
but I shot him first.

662
01:13:09,718 --> 01:13:12,084
You protected us.
You were brave.

663
01:13:12,154 --> 01:13:13,416
You were strong.

664
01:13:13,489 --> 01:13:16,788
<i>You did what you had to do,
darling. Darling...</i>

665
01:13:17,326 --> 01:13:19,419
Who was he, Dad?
Why was he here?

666
01:13:19,495 --> 01:13:21,190
He was a thief with a gun.

667
01:13:21,263 --> 01:13:23,163
Some skelm from the township.

668
01:13:24,867 --> 01:13:26,232
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

669
01:13:32,841 --> 01:13:36,072
<i>It's okay. It's all right.
It's all right.</i>

670
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:38,712
<i>It's all right.</i>

671
01:14:06,108 --> 01:14:07,507
Precious.

672
01:14:07,576 --> 01:14:09,100
Somebody left this for you.

673
01:14:15,350 --> 01:14:18,285
<i>I don't want any trouble,
my girl. Okay?</i>

674
01:14:26,094 --> 01:14:27,288
<i>It's done.</i>

675
01:16:32,054 --> 01:16:33,248
Chewing gum?

676
01:17:10,258 --> 01:17:11,953
Can you reach the plant
from that shaft?

677
01:17:12,027 --> 01:17:13,494
The elevators still works.

678
01:17:13,562 --> 01:17:14,961
If you worked underground,
you could.

679
01:17:15,030 --> 01:17:16,258
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

680
01:17:23,138 --> 01:17:25,129
<i>He'll be coming out
at mine shaft number three.</i>

681
01:17:25,207 --> 01:17:27,368
<i>That's correct. Repeat,
mine shaft number three.</i>

682
01:17:33,115 --> 01:17:34,548
Go, go, go, go, go!

683
01:18:14,056 --> 01:18:15,353
Get back. Back.

684
01:18:15,557 --> 01:18:17,252
Back! Back! Police.

685
01:18:18,093 --> 01:18:20,061
That door.
Right. Come on, boys.

686
01:18:20,429 --> 01:18:22,858
Quietly.

687
01:19:04,439 --> 01:19:06,532
Block every road
in every direction.

688
01:19:06,742 --> 01:19:08,232
Echo Seven, Echo Seven.

689
01:19:08,376 --> 01:19:10,241
Block every road
in every direction.

690
01:20:27,756 --> 01:20:29,849
<i>I'll check the core reactor.
You search.</i>

691
01:21:56,378 --> 01:21:57,640
Found it.

692
01:22:25,206 --> 01:22:27,538
<i>Sierra 1 from Sierra 7.</i>

693
01:22:27,609 --> 01:22:31,067
<i>Sir, they reported a man crashing
through the barrier at Kinross.</i>

694
01:22:31,146 --> 01:22:34,047
<i>Two police down.
Repeat, two police down.</i>

695
01:22:45,493 --> 01:22:46,858
Miriam!

696
01:23:06,948 --> 01:23:09,382
<i>Excuse me, sir. There's
a girl outside to see you.</i>

697
01:24:34,769 --> 01:24:36,168
Stop!

698
01:24:37,572 --> 01:24:38,834
Stop!

699
01:24:40,542 --> 01:24:42,066
Hands up!

700
01:24:46,347 --> 01:24:51,910
Take off your clothes!
Take off your clothes!

701
01:24:57,792 --> 01:25:00,886
Your pants! Take them off!

702
01:25:14,409 --> 01:25:15,740
<i>He's clean.</i>

703
01:25:31,693 --> 01:25:33,752
You people
will never learn.

704
01:25:35,330 --> 01:25:36,888
<i>They'll probably
hang you.</i>

705
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:42,630
<i>Or if you're lucky you'll spend
the rest of your life in jail.</i>

706
01:25:44,806 --> 01:25:47,104
<i>There's nothing else
you can do with me.</i>

707
01:25:49,978 --> 01:25:51,468
My life is finished.

708
01:25:53,815 --> 01:25:56,340
I may never see
my children again,

709
01:25:58,019 --> 01:26:00,010
but when they speak
of their father,

710
01:26:00,555 --> 01:26:04,855
<i>they will say, "He was a man
who stood up for what was right.</i>

711
01:26:06,494 --> 01:26:10,897
<i>"A man who said,
'I must do something now. '"</i>

712
01:26:12,333 --> 01:26:14,563
What will your children say
about you?

713
01:26:26,781 --> 01:26:30,774
<i>Years later, when I came
back to that township,</i>

714
01:26:30,952 --> 01:26:33,216
<i>the neighbors said
that after that day,</i>

715
01:26:33,288 --> 01:26:36,587
<i>Zuko and Sixpence
were never seen again.</i>

716
01:26:38,693 --> 01:26:42,254
<i>He kept me there at that
farm for many months,</i>

717
01:26:42,330 --> 01:26:45,731
<i>trying to find
where our leaders might be.</i>

718
01:26:46,201 --> 01:26:48,692
<i>So, they could also be killed.</i>

719
01:26:53,308 --> 01:26:56,744
<i>I was sentenced to 24 years
in prison</i>

720
01:26:56,811 --> 01:27:00,110
<i>on a little island
at the bottom of Africa,</i>

721
01:27:00,181 --> 01:27:01,876
<i>Robben Island.</i>

722
01:27:03,251 --> 01:27:06,311
<i>There were almost
1000 of us.</i>

723
01:27:06,387 --> 01:27:10,289
<i>Mostly men like me,
found guilty of treason.</i>

724
01:27:10,358 --> 01:27:13,657
<i>Men who spent their days
breaking rocks.</i>

725
01:27:14,229 --> 01:27:18,393
<i>So many hearts filled with
sorrow and filled with anger.</i>

726
01:27:19,701 --> 01:27:25,071
<i>But our leader, our father,
he told us,</i>

727
01:27:25,139 --> 01:27:26,902
<i>we could never be free</i>

728
01:27:27,308 --> 01:27:29,776
<i>until we learned to forgive.</i>

729
01:27:39,354 --> 01:27:40,548
Africa.

730
01:27:40,622 --> 01:27:42,920
<i>After five years
in that prison,</i>

731
01:27:43,725 --> 01:27:47,718
<i>Precious, had written to say,
she was getting married again.</i>

732
01:27:47,795 --> 01:27:54,200
<i>And after another five years I found
the power in my heart to forgive.</i>

733
01:27:57,405 --> 01:28:03,139
<i>Then they were forced to end the system
of apartheid that had kept our people down</i>

734
01:28:03,244 --> 01:28:07,044
<i>and we could go home again,
back to Africa.</i>

735
01:29:19,887 --> 01:29:22,879
Precious. You look good.

736
01:29:22,957 --> 01:29:24,788
A little more curvy.

737
01:29:26,094 --> 01:29:28,585
<i>Are you saying I'm fat?
Maybe.</i>

738
01:29:35,236 --> 01:29:38,433
Lindiwe passed Matric
with flying colors.

739
01:29:38,506 --> 01:29:41,202
<i>Second in her class.
Oh, that's my girl.</i>

740
01:29:45,546 --> 01:29:47,810
Albertina has a boyfriend.

741
01:29:49,250 --> 01:29:50,774
<i>No, you didn't tell me that.</i>

742
01:29:51,419 --> 01:29:53,979
<i>Patrick, it's only
since last week.</i>

743
01:29:57,558 --> 01:30:00,755
<i>She thinks
maybe you won't like him.</i>

744
01:30:01,362 --> 01:30:02,954
<i>She's scared about that.</i>

745
01:30:03,798 --> 01:30:05,288
She should be.

746
01:30:15,243 --> 01:30:18,474
<i>Patrick, I'm sorry.</i>

747
01:30:19,547 --> 01:30:21,105
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

748
01:30:22,417 --> 01:30:25,648
<i>Yeah, me too. I'm sorry.</i>

749
01:30:50,077 --> 01:30:53,979
<i>I tried to settle down, start again.</i>

750
01:30:54,182 --> 01:30:57,049
<i>Moved back to live
close to my kids.</i>

751
01:30:57,885 --> 01:31:00,649
<i>Started even
to understand myself.</i>

752
01:31:01,522 --> 01:31:02,921
<i>My mistakes.</i>

753
01:31:05,259 --> 01:31:06,726
<i>But that man.</i>

754
01:31:06,994 --> 01:31:09,292
<i>That pain he caused
to so many.</i>

755
01:31:10,631 --> 01:31:13,691
<i>That pain kept coming back.</i>

756
01:31:14,335 --> 01:31:16,303
<i>I kept seeing him.</i>

757
01:31:17,705 --> 01:31:20,799
<i>In my nights and the days.</i>

758
01:31:28,049 --> 01:31:32,145
<i>I moved closer to prove
to my mind that it was him.</i>

759
01:31:33,087 --> 01:31:34,554
<i>That monster.</i>

760
01:31:53,541 --> 01:31:57,307
<i>Then I said to myself,
"Patrick, you can end it now.</i>

761
01:31:57,378 --> 01:31:59,869
<i>"Break his neck.
Kill him.</i>

762
01:31:59,947 --> 01:32:02,677
<i>"Here in this spot. End it. "</i>

763
01:32:21,402 --> 01:32:25,566
<i>As I was walking towards him,
I said, "No, oh, no!</i>

764
01:32:25,940 --> 01:32:27,931
<i>"Killing is not going
to help me.</i>

765
01:32:28,175 --> 01:32:29,802
<i>"Revenge is not good.</i>

766
01:32:29,877 --> 01:32:33,040
<i>"It's going to be...
It's going to carry on war</i>

767
01:32:33,281 --> 01:32:36,614
<i>"for this generation,
and the next generation.</i>

768
01:32:36,884 --> 01:32:42,914
<i>"Let me let him live
and then I will be free.</i>

769
01:32:42,990 --> 01:32:45,185
<i>"I am free
and everyone is free.</i>

770
01:33:03,911 --> 01:33:06,937
So, I built this house
so every child

771
01:33:07,014 --> 01:33:11,576
that has been left without
parents is coming here.

772
01:33:12,253 --> 01:33:15,347
<i>It belongs to them.
It's not my house anymore.</i>

773
01:33:15,690 --> 01:33:17,658
Those are the owners
of this house.
