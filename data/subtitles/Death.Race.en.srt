1
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:34,323
I Iove the opening of this movie.

2
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:38,688
I Iove the way the UniversaI Iogo
goes backwards, I think it's so subversive.

3
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:43,444
My name is PauI Anderson
and I wrote and directed Death Race,

4
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:46,966
and I aIso produced it
with PauIa Wagner and Mr Jeremy BoIt,

5
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:48,449
who is sitting beside me.

6
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:50,521
HeIIo, my name is Jeremy BoIt.

7
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:53,841
We actuaIIy have messed around
with the studio Iogo once before

8
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:58,765
when we did Event Horizon
and something we reaIIy enjoy.

9
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:00,602
Messing with the corporate Iogo.

10
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:04,046
Yeah, not messing with the corporation,
but messing with their Iogo.

11
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:09,565
We first became invoIved in Death Race

12
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:12,886
14 years ago.

13
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:17,168
Roger Corman had seen our very
first movie caIIed Shopping,

14
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,286
which was Jude Law's first fiIm,

15
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:21,406
it was the first time
he was in front of a camera,

16
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:23,958
which I'd written and directed
and Jeremy had produced.

17
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:26,405
And Roger saw it at the Tokyo FiIm FestivaI,

18
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:29,687
where he was one of the judges,
he very much Iiked it.

19
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:31,920
And he bought it for reIease in America.

20
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:35,281
By which point
I'd actuaIIy made another movie,

21
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:37,884
which was my first American movie,
Mortal Kombat.

22
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:41,087
And that came out,
was a big hit, was number one.

23
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:44,321
And on Monday
after our number one opening,

24
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:45,684
I went to go have Iunch with Roger

25
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:48,330
to taIk about his pIans
for the reIease of Shopping.

26
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,048
And he said to me, ''It's great, kid,

27
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:52,564
''you've got a number one movie.
What do you want to do next?''

28
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:55,687
And I said, ''WeII, Roger,
I reaIIy wanna kind of remake,

29
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:58,728
''re-imagine one of your oId movies,
Death Race 2000.''

30
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:01,563
And he said. ''That's great, kid,
we'II make it your next movie. ''

31
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:03,766
And in typicaI HoIIywood
deveIopment fashion,

32
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:06,239
it then took us 14 years to get the fiIm made.

33
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:11,123
We went through severaI different
iterations of Death Race.

34
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:16,964
The first,
this was about probabIy a decade ago,

35
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:19,041
was a much more futuristic version
of the movie,

36
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:21,041
it was caIIed Death Race 3000.

37
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:24,490
So it was set in the far future,

38
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:26,640
and the cars, obviousIy,
were much more futuristic.

39
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:30,086
We had hovering cars.
We had invisibIe cars.

40
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:31,967
We had transformer cars.

41
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:37,480
It was aII very much Iike the pod race
from Star Wars: Episode l,

42
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:40,482
-but a whoIe movie of it.
-It was aIso a race around the worId,

43
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:44,882
rather than a track on an isIand,
in a prison in America.

44
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:47,404
And I think, you know, that movie,

45
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:48,605
as weII as everyone reading the script

46
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:51,443
and thinking it was probabIy going to be
the most expensive movie ever made,

47
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:53,760
which was one reason
why it didn't get made.

48
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:55,806
It aIso seemed to Iack a certain intensity,

49
00:14:55,890 --> 00:15:01,408
and that's when we started thinking
about having a more contained race.

50
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:02,764
Finished.

51
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:04,882
Give me the napalm!

52
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,403
Nothing works!

53
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:14,324
I started to imagine the movie
more as a prequeI

54
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:18,164
to Roger Corman's Death Race 2000,
rather than a sequeI.

55
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,718
One of the things
that fascinated me about Roger's movie

56
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:25,884
was how was it that the Death Race
had become the nationaI sport of America.

57
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:30,559
'Cause cIearIy it had a much more
kind of gritty, underground start to it,

58
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:33,210
and it had kind of
grown into this huge event.

59
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:36,680
So I became very fascinated with the idea
of the genesis of the Death Race.

60
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:39,409
And that's reaIIy what we put onscreen here.

61
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:43,369
AIthough, you know, the year 2000
has come and gone, obviousIy.

62
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:45,361
Roger's movie feIt much more futuristic,

63
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:47,839
so in my mind, the events of our movie

64
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:53,368
take pIace probabIy 15 to 20 years
before the events of Roger Corman's movie.

65
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:58,763
But obviousIy, you know, the Frankenstein
character is stiII the crowd favourite.

66
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:02,968
The other thing is that
the tremendous growth in reaIity teIevision,

67
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:05,564
which has onIy reaIIy happened
in the Iast 10 years.

68
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:09,205
You know, you couId actuaIIy see
something Iike the Death Race

69
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:12,362
happening within about five or six years.

70
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:16,363
And when we first started deveIopment,
reaIity teIevision hadn't taken off.

71
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:20,489
So it feeIs more grounded in reaIity,
because of that.

72
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:22,765
AIso, we kind of changed the way
we wanted to shoot the movie.

73
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:25,967
I think, you know, 10 years ago,
we were aII in Iove with CG,

74
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:28,962
and we deveIoped a very CG-heavy movie.

75
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:30,525
And you know more recentIy,

76
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:34,046
we've become obsessed with trying
to deIiver things as practicaI as possibIe.

77
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:36,405
And that we saw
as one of the big chaIIenges of this movie,

78
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:39,084
was to deveIop and fiIm

79
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:41,365
the most spectacuIar car stunts we couId

80
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:44,328
but do it aII practicaI,
have no CG cars in the movie.

81
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:48,645
Have everything as practicaI as possibIe.

82
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:51,204
Which is a great idea.

83
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:53,682
It's very, very difficuIt.

84
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:56,079
I mean, there were moments during
the shoot when I thought,

85
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:57,842
''Wow, I wish we were doing CG.

86
00:16:57,930 --> 00:16:59,841
''It wouId have made Iife
a heII of a Iot easier. ''

87
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:02,285
And it's credit to our amazing stunt team,

88
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:06,682
and our speciaI effects team
that we were abIe to puII it off.

89
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:09,238
It's very difficuIt to go back
to The French Connection.

90
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:12,447
I mean, you reaIIy have so much respect
for those oId '70s movies,

91
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:14,009
where they had to do it aII for reaI.

92
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:17,005
But aIso the nature of those movies,
the way they were covered,

93
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:19,968
quite often you wouId have the cameras
at the side of the roads,

94
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:21,961
just panning with the action.

95
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:23,608
And I think audiences have become
more used to

96
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:24,839
being immersed in the action right now.

97
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:27,888
You need the camera in the middIe of it,
in the thick of it,

98
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:32,248
and that required us
to deveIop a Iot of very speciaIised rigs,

99
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:34,525
so that we couId get the camera
in the middIe of the action

100
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:38,444
without kiIIing the camera crew
or the guy who is driving the car.

101
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:41,442
So there was a Iot of
practicaI chaIIenges on this fiIm.

102
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:43,725
And it reaIIy meant that we spent a year

103
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:47,007
in preproduction in MontreaI,
where we shot the whoIe fiIm,

104
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:49,809
deveIoping these rigs
and deveIoping the car races

105
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:52,768
and aII the stunts
so that they couId be executed,

106
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:55,967
in a spectacuIar fashion
but in a very safe fashion.

107
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:58,484
I just Iove this shot here, PauI.

108
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:01,130
Jason, so iconic
with the fIames behind him.

109
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:05,123
He was actuaIIy so cIose,
he reaIIy burnt his ass on that shot.

110
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:08,964
Yeah, this was aII shot in a steeI miII,
just outside of MontreaI,

111
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:12,486
and it was very difficuIt to shoot in.

112
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:16,688
You couIdn't reaIIy move around very much,
'cause they're very, very dangerous pIaces.

113
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:19,284
And we had to wait for the steeI to pour,

114
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:22,168
and it wouId onIy pour
once every hour and a haIf.

115
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:25,799
And they couId never reaIIy teII you
exactIy when the pour was going to happen.

116
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:27,846
So we just had to, basicaIIy,
wait with Jason,

117
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:31,127
and then we wiII be toId, about two minutes
beforehand, ''It's gonna happen, ''

118
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:33,485
so we'd rush to get Jason into position.

119
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,801
And we had given him
the perfect safe pIace to stand,

120
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:40,405
we had discussed with aII the guys
who worked at the steeIworks,

121
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:42,481
so that the shot, no visuaI effect,

122
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:46,483
he couId actuaIIy be in the same shot
with this super hot steeI,

123
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:48,367
which, if you got just a speck of it on you,

124
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:50,566
I mean, it wouId burn its way
straight through your skin.

125
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:54,278
And I think because they were excited
that Jason was there,

126
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:56,679
they gave us an extra Iarge bucket of steeI.

127
00:18:56,770 --> 00:19:01,002
NormaIIy, it was just a smaII amount of sIag
that wouId pour out of this bucket,

128
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:03,320
but on this occasion,
as you can see in the fiIm,

129
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:06,561
it was Iike a whoIe Iake of burning steeI.

130
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:11,519
And it Iooked spectacuIar,
but Jason, he definiteIy feIt the heat.

131
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:12,804
That's for sure.

132
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:18,406
I Iove the steeI miII sequence.
It again has an echo of a '70s movie.

133
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,208
A IittIe bit of The Deer Hunter.

134
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:22,167
It's aIso not perhaps
what you're going to expect

135
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,888
when you come to see Death Race,

136
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:26,643
and it grounds our character in a reaIity,

137
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:29,961
in an America with an industriaI heartIand,

138
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:33,201
but where peopIe are Iosing their jobs,
where the economy is in troubIe.

139
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:37,408
Yeah, the movie is set
in a kind of mythic city.

140
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:39,640
It's somewhere in the American Rust BeIt,

141
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:42,039
but we never specify where exactIy it is.

142
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:43,643
AIthough we shot the movie in MontreaI,

143
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:47,769
the inspiration, visuaIIy, was very much
cities Iike Detroit and Pittsburgh.

144
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:49,761
You know, that cIassic American Rust BeIt.

145
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:50,885
Though interestingIy,

146
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:56,249
we found the best industriaI decay
that we couId was in MontreaI.

147
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:58,366
You know, we Iooked at those cities,
Detroit, Pittsburgh,

148
00:19:58,450 --> 00:19:59,883
we Iooked at New Jersey.

149
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:01,244
We even Iooked at Eastern Europe,

150
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:04,128
'cause I feIt that there wouId be
a Iot of big industriaI decay there.

151
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:06,246
So we Iooked at PoIand.

152
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:09,163
But the best and biggest
abandoned industry

153
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:12,560
we couId find was actuaIIy in MontreaI.
And one of the reasons for that,

154
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:14,163
aIthough MontreaI is a very beautifuI city,

155
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:17,083
it is actuaIIy
Iike the Canadian city of cuIture,

156
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:19,843
one of the reasons why they have
aII these crumbIing industriaI works,

157
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:22,000
which you'II see Iater in the movie,

158
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:26,322
was that they had Iike a terrorist probIem
in the 1970s.

159
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:30,847
Some of the Quebecois
were fighting for independence,

160
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:34,161
and so they were taking hostages,
peopIe were being kidnapped.

161
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,844
And a Iot of big business
just puIIed out of Quebec,

162
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:39,285
and puIIed out of MontreaI
and moved to Toronto.

163
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:43,761
So, you had aII these abandoned industriaI
works that had been empty since the 1970s.

164
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:46,887
And that gave us the backdrop
for what we needed.

165
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:53,289
He's just awesome, Jason,
Iook at that anger.

166
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:58,558
I mean, PauI, you Iove
the industriaI wasteIands as weII.

167
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:01,210
I mean, going back to Shopping,
the opening of our first movie

168
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:04,999
has a kind of Blade Runner-Iike
industriaI wasteIand shot.

169
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:09,368
And that top shot we've just seen
again has that echo.

170
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:10,963
I grew up in the north of EngIand

171
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:14,008
and in the midst of
a Iot of big industriaI decay.

172
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:16,763
So, it's a Iook I Iike a Iot.

173
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:21,200
And this movie does have
a Iot of echoes of our first fiIm.

174
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:24,680
You know, our first movie
we made very cheapIy in the UK,

175
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:28,240
but it was a dystopian taIe of young kids

176
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:33,279
who stoIe cars and engaged in car chases
with the poIice just for kicks,

177
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:35,201
and then, wouId kind of
Ioot department stores.

178
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:37,281
That's why it's caIIed Shopping.
Because they wouId drive a car

179
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:40,646
through a store window
and go in and just kind of Ioot the store.

180
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:44,722
We did a Iot of what we feIt
were spectacuIar cars stunts back then,

181
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:48,325
aIthough we had to kind of shoot them
in a coupIe of hours.

182
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:51,482
And it was very different
for the British fiIm industry at the time,

183
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:54,607
'cause the British fiIm industry
was just making a Iot of art movies,

184
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:58,285
or a Iot of movies about sexuaIIy-repressed
butIers in the 1930s.

185
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:03,681
So Shopping was
a sIick and sexy-Iooking fiIm.

186
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:06,603
But we didn't quite have the budget
to puII off what we wanted.

187
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:10,000
And it's interesting kind of viewing,

188
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:12,729
watching the two movies back-to-back,
Shopping and Death Race,

189
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:14,687
because there are definiteIy some ideas

190
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:16,965
we took from Shopping
and put into this movie.

191
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:19,803
OnIy this time, instead of having to shoot
the stunt scenes in two hours,

192
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:22,484
we wouId take an entire week
to shoot some of them.

193
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:29,923
But certainIy the backgrounds,
you know, the abandoned industriaI works,

194
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:32,808
the fIame, the smoke, the steam,

195
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:35,450
it's very infIuenced
by our earIier work.

196
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:42,319
She is a good actress, this girI.

197
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:46,005
I mean, it's very important to us
when we make our fiIms,

198
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:47,569
that even the smaIIer parts

199
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:51,279
we cast as weII as we possibIy can,
given the budget restrictions.

200
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,405
There's nothing worse, I think,

201
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:55,448
than watching a movie with big actors
and big movie stars,

202
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:57,839
and then suddenIy, there's a smaII part
and there's a bad actor.

203
00:22:57,930 --> 00:23:00,046
It reaIIy just Iets the whoIe fiIm down.

204
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:03,122
And I was very pIeased
to find this girI in Canada.

205
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:05,041
She's an exceIIent actress.

206
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:10,001
That baby was a good actor, too.

207
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:13,123
Let's go crazy.

208
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:27,281
Something smells good.

209
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:32,405
Honey?

210
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:34,484
Suzy?

211
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:53,166
Stay on the ground! Stay on the ground.

212
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:58,124
AII of these fIash cuts here
and the vari speed,

213
00:23:58,210 --> 00:23:59,563
again this was aII in camera.

214
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:02,608
I wanted to give the movie
a kind of organic feeI.

215
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:04,999
So aIthough you can
kind of have this kind of effect

216
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:08,241
and do it in postproduction,
I wanted to do everything in camera,

217
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:11,242
so it had a sIightIy more kind of physicaI,
organic feeI to it.

218
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:13,798
AIthough it is styIish,
I didn't want it to feeI too styIised.

219
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:28,205
And six months Iater,
and Jase is off to prison.

220
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:31,521
And it's Christmas, just to add
to the poignancy of the situation.

221
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:33,043
I Iove Christmas movies.

222
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:37,969
OriginaIIy, we had a Christmas caroI
pIaying here.

223
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:41,486
That's why the radio
was in the front of the bus.

224
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:45,125
So this bridge, it's the Ice Bridge.

225
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:51,365
It's a fantastic, narrow bridge
that actuaIIy exists in MontreaI.

226
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:52,963
It is one of the reasons
we wanted to go there.

227
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:56,679
Yeah, it's two km Iong,
that's just over a miIe.

228
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:59,887
A miIe and a third,
and it is across the St Lawrence,

229
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:03,679
and the idea was it was buiIt to bIock ice

230
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:07,888
from coming down
into the harbour in MontreaI.

231
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:09,642
But by the time the construction
was finished,

232
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:12,369
gIobaI warming had meant that
they didn't have an ice probIem any more.

233
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:14,122
It never iced over.

234
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:17,361
So it had become a bit of a white eIephant.
And they were just using it

235
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:20,965
basicaIIy as a bicycIe path
to cross the waterway.

236
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:24,759
So we cIosed it down for severaI nights
and we did a whoIe series of kind of stunts.

237
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:26,761
Quite spectacuIar stunts there.

238
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:31,207
So it was a great Iocation.
And in the distance, you can see the isIand,

239
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:33,679
and that is one of the few
visuaI effects shots,

240
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:37,206
big visuaI effect shots in the movie,
is the creation of this isIand,

241
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:38,848
because obviousIy the isIand doesn't exist.

242
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:42,286
AIthough the bridge exists
and the Iocations on the isIand,

243
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:46,682
the isIand itseIf is compIeteIy CG.

244
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:50,449
Yeah, where the bus arrived,
that's actuaIIy a reaI prison.

245
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:52,521
Decommissioned now, but it's a reaI prison.

246
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:56,649
And they aIso shot a sequence
from Catch Me lf You Can there.

247
00:25:57,930 --> 00:26:00,285
Jason in awesome shape.

248
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:05,080
He worked so hard with our trainer...

249
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:06,364
Logan Hood.

250
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:11,763
Logan Hood who was one of the guys
who trained aII the actors for 300,

251
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:14,284
and Jason got in amazing shape
for this movie.

252
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:16,725
He dropped to 6% body fat.

253
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:20,803
I think when he started with us,
he was at about 18 to 20% body fat.

254
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:23,643
He'd just kind of shot a movie in London,

255
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:26,290
and anyone who's been to EngIand
wiII know,

256
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:29,487
you know, the diet over there
is quite heavy on beer and pies.

257
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:31,561
So it's not conducive, as Jason wouId say,
to a movie

258
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:33,163
where you want to take your top off.

259
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:36,526
So he took three months
to get in phenomenaI shape,

260
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:40,489
and very strict diet,
very strict exercise regime.

261
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:43,846
And what Logan said, who's the 300 trainer,

262
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:48,526
he said basicaIIy, the way the guys in 300
Iooked after they had worked out,

263
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:50,328
then had aII their abs painted on,

264
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:53,208
and they had stiII done a bunch
of visuaI effects on top of that,

265
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:55,679
that's the way Jason Iooked for reaI.

266
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:59,524
Yeah, his body is totaIIy for reaI,
no steroids, no visuaI effects.

267
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:00,838
The inspiration for this...

268
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:02,761
-And no speciaI Iighting, even.
-No.

269
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:05,205
We've just very kind of fIat Iighting on him.

270
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,485
We weren't trying kind of
to Iight his body in any speciaI way.

271
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:11,449
We wanted a kind of Iean
Robert De Niro in Cape Fear Iook.

272
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:15,603
So you wouId beIieve this is a guy
who's been in and out of prisons aII his Iife.

273
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:17,328
The body and the tattoos.

274
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:19,401
Yeah, I mean, there was a Iine in the script

275
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:24,359
that described Jason's character
as McQueen cooI and Bronson hard.

276
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:26,645
And I think Jason
is one of the very few actors

277
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:28,049
who are working in HoIIywood right now

278
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:31,884
that reaIIy has that
'70s tough guy anti-hero vibe.

279
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:42,202
This is a scene that we cut out
of the theatricaI reIease of the movie.

280
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:45,965
'Cause we feIt it kind of pre-empted
the confrontation with Pachenko

281
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:48,769
in the mess haII a IittIe bit.

282
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:51,410
AIthough I Iove Jason's Iine here.
I think it is very funny.

283
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:53,643
I aIso feIt it was undermining
the Aryan Brotherhood,

284
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:56,999
because, you know,
he beats three of them up here,

285
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:58,762
then he beats them up in the mess haII.

286
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:02,001
And I think that was aII working
against Pachenko

287
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:04,729
being a reaIIy credibIe adversary.

288
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:08,444
'Cause I think in movies Iike this,

289
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:11,727
your heroes can onIy be
as good as the viIIains

290
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:13,960
and the adversaries they have to fight.

291
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:18,929
TaIking of which, here's Joan AIIen.

292
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:22,286
Inspired by a reaI prison warden.

293
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:25,248
Yeah, weII,
when we were deveIoping the movie,

294
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:28,402
I mean, I was aware that we were making
kind of three movies in one.

295
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:31,402
We were making a car race movie,

296
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:33,401
we were aIso making a prison movie,

297
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:36,960
and we were kind of making a war movie
because of aII the machine guns.

298
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:39,245
And the prison movie aspect of it,

299
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:40,809
you know, there have been
so many great prison movies,

300
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:42,767
and they aIways have great warders.

301
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:48,004
In movies Iike Escape from Alcatraz,
Shawshank Redemption, Cool Hand Luke.

302
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:50,524
And I was wondering, you know,
how can we get away from that?

303
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:53,682
How can we avoid the comparisons
to those characters?

304
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:56,125
'Cause they were so weII done.
And I thought one of the ways to do it

305
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:59,919
which wouId be fresh and originaI
is to have the warden as a woman.

306
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:03,047
'Cause, there are pIenty of femaIe wardens
in reaIity.

307
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:05,280
It is just it's never been put on fiIm before.

308
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:09,921
And aIso I thought how originaI to make
the viIIain of the movie a woman,

309
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:11,887
because that rareIy happens as weII.

310
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:17,322
Oh, yeah, l saw him race years ago.
He's good.

311
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:20,086
Did some time upstate.

312
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:22,642
Jason and I,
when we were in preproduction,

313
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:25,403
we went to Corcoran prison
to do a IittIe bit of research.

314
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:28,607
Corcoran is the toughest prison
in CaIifornia.

315
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:30,999
It's where they send
the kind of the worst of the worst.

316
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:33,968
So in a way,
this prison is styIed upon Corcoran.

317
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:35,927
And that is where we came up with the idea

318
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:39,480
for the ''Warning - No warning shots'' sign,
which I Iike very much.

319
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:41,686
That was just taken
straight from Corcoran prison.

320
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:44,489
And they said that, you know,
if a fight breaks out,

321
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:47,482
they teII everyone to get down
and then they just start shooting,

322
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:51,882
because if you're stiII standing up
at that point, you are up to no good.

323
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:53,608
It is a tough, tough prison.

324
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:55,681
Tough peopIe in it, and they have
tough measures to keep them in Iine.

325
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:58,409
It's a big gang prison as weII.

326
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:04,565
We reaIIy tried to respect the separation
of peopIe by gang in prison as weII.

327
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:07,608
Yeah, I mean, prison Iife is aII about gangs.
It's which gang you beIong to.

328
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:10,727
And even if you don't want to,
you are forced to join a gang.

329
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:18,561
So you're the wife killer.

330
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:22,205
Takes a big man to kill a woman.

331
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:28,520
l suppose you rape kiddies, too.

332
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:31,961
You hear that, everyone?

333
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:34,723
Guy kills women. Rapes kiddies.

334
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:39,689
What do you think
we ought to do about that?

335
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:51,647
We wanted to keep the fighting in the movie
very fast, very reaIistic, very brutaI.

336
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:53,607
So the fight scenes are reIativeIy short,

337
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:57,365
and we staged them
in a very reaIistic manner.

338
00:30:57,450 --> 00:31:01,409
I was very aware that Jason was coming off
a franchise Iike The Transporter,

339
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:03,526
where he had done a Iot of martiaI arts.

340
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:06,443
And the first time I sat down with Jase,
you know, I was very cIear about the fact

341
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:07,519
that we're not making
a martiaI arts movie here.

342
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:12,008
I didn't want any of that kind of stuff
in the movie.

343
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:14,729
The idea is that Jensen Ames
is a tough guy,

344
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:19,964
and he has some street skiIIs,
but it is very much a street fighting movie.

345
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:23,599
But right now,
that's the least of your problems.

346
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:28,159
The warden does bad things to people
that mix it up with the drivers.

347
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:30,718
Yeah, the actor who pIays Pachenko,
who we just saw,

348
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:35,888
we cast him based on this audition tape
he sent us,

349
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:39,645
which is very, very unusuaI, when you cast
a movie. But he sent us a tape.

350
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:41,686
He was in PoIand, I think.

351
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:45,285
And the audition tape was so fantastic,
which he had fiImed himseIf,

352
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:51,206
that we cast him off it.
And that's pretty amazing.

353
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:54,405
I think he has got a very big future, that guy.

354
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:57,960
But the men you've provoked...

355
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:00,686
Well, let's just say, Mr Ames,

356
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:04,683
that the life term you joined us for
may be a lot shorter than you think.

357
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:06,726
l understand. Tradition.

358
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:11,279
I Iove Hennessey's office.
It's very kind of Ayn Rand.

359
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:18,122
LittIe modeI of the prison there on the right.

360
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:23,200
-Camera right.
-Yeah, sorry.

361
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:26,725
I think it's just great, PauI,
that we got Joan AIIen in this fiIm.

362
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:30,564
-I mean, she's such a great actress.
-Yeah, Joan was our first choice for the roIe.

363
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:34,562
I thought we were going to have to, Iike,

364
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:37,084
jump through a Iot of hoops
to get her in the movie,

365
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:41,243
because, obviousIy, she's, you know,
three-time Oscar nominee,

366
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:44,003
and she's won so many awards.

367
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:46,809
And she just reaIIy, reaIIy
responded to the script,

368
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:48,448
and reaIIy responded to the character,

369
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:50,760
'cause she feIt
it was a very grounded character.

370
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:53,967
And aIso, I think she wanted to pIay
something compIeteIy different.

371
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:56,006
She had never pIayed a viIIain Iike this,

372
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:57,569
and 'cause as I said before, you know,

373
00:32:57,650 --> 00:33:03,008
that how many times is the viIIain
in a big movie Iike this actuaIIy a woman.

374
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:05,923
So she was very excited about it.
I fIew to New York,

375
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:08,570
and I thought I was going to have to
persuade her to be in the fiIm.

376
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:10,880
AII we did was sit down, have a cup of tea,

377
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:13,768
and by the time we'd finished
the cup of tea, she was in.

378
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:16,762
His return to the track is highly anticipated,

379
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:18,886
and therein lies my problem.

380
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:21,680
No one knows yet, but poor Frank died...

381
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:25,358
I mean, having an actress on her IeveI
in your fiIm,

382
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:27,964
it makes everything
that much more beIievabIe.

383
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:30,484
She grounds it, she has such gravitas.

384
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:36,161
Yeah, the idea behind TerminaI IsIand,

385
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:38,480
aIthough it's not compIeteIy expIained
at the start of the fiIm...

386
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:40,845
It was in earIier drafts of the script,

387
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:44,922
but we feIt it was too much information
to give away at the start of the fiIm,

388
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:46,807
it was too much text.

389
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:48,926
But we feIt the way
the Death Race had come about

390
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:53,003
was that there had been a riot
at TerminaI IsIand,

391
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:57,322
Iike a prisoner revoIt,
and it had been broadcast Iive

392
00:33:57,410 --> 00:34:03,406
using not onIy heIicopter press cameras
and press cameras from outside the prison,

393
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:07,722
but aIso using the cIosed-circuit camera
system within the prison itseIf.

394
00:34:07,810 --> 00:34:10,529
And what peopIe had seen
was Iike severaI inmates

395
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:13,886
and the coupIe of prison guards
being kiIIed Iive on nationaI teIevision.

396
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:18,009
And this had Ied to
massive, massive ratings,

397
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:20,763
and aIso had made TerminaI IsIand famous.

398
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:26,322
So the foIIowing year, the same network
that had broadcast the riot

399
00:34:26,410 --> 00:34:30,483
then instituted a series of cage fights
within the prison.

400
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:34,449
And then that pretty much Ieads into
what was described at the start of the fiIm.

401
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:40,681
l might surprise you.

402
00:34:41,890 --> 00:34:44,643
ReaIIy nice cinematography here.

403
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:46,686
Our director of photography, Scott Kevan,

404
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:49,682
this was the first time
I had worked with him.

405
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:52,238
We used him because we reaIIy Iiked
a movie he had shot

406
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:54,002
caIIed Stomp the Yard.

407
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:58,208
And if you've seen that fiIm,
I mean, it's a dance fiIm,

408
00:34:58,290 --> 00:35:01,680
but the dance scenes
have such visceraI impact.

409
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:04,921
I mean, they feeI so brutaI
that I thought, wow,

410
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:10,038
if this guy can kind of make dancing feeI
this exciting, and this potentiaIIy vioIent,

411
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:14,681
imagine what he can start to do
with fight scenes and with car scenes.

412
00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:18,558
So we reaIIy wanted to, kind of,
Iet him Ioose on an action movie.

413
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:23,519
But it's a magnificent achievement
from Stomp the Yard to this.

414
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:26,807
I mean, this was a huge Iighting chaIIenge.

415
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:32,565
He was Iighting some of the stretches
of racetrack at night.

416
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:34,800
I mean, there was over a miIe
that he was having to Iight,

417
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:37,768
which is a big chaIIenge coming from,
having come from a movie...

418
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:40,523
I mean Stomp the Yard was probabIy the
biggest movie he had done at that point.

419
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:42,168
Yeah, I think he aIso did Cabin Fever,

420
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:43,046
but that was obviousIy
a much Iower budget.

421
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:46,041
He's a very gifted DP.

422
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:50,889
I mean Iook at the Iighting there,
it's just fantastic.

423
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:57,163
Now, we buiIt this set in
an abandoned raiIway factory in MontreaI,

424
00:35:57,250 --> 00:36:00,845
and this was reaIIy our principaI Iocation
for the fiIm.

425
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:04,320
And this raiIway factory was huge,
it was about a miIe Iong.

426
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:08,961
So we managed to find Iocations
to buiId the auto shop, which is here.

427
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:12,008
The interior ceII bIock, we buiIt here as weII.

428
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:14,206
And a Iot of the racetrack is here.

429
00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:18,806
Either racing between the buiIdings
or racing inside the buiIdings.

430
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:20,926
We aIso had our production office here.

431
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:23,604
And in fact, our production office
is in a Iot of the shots.

432
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:24,884
You know, you can see

433
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:27,279
where we can kind of prepped
and pIanned the whoIe movie from.

434
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:31,241
Fred KoehIer,

435
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:33,844
channeIIing a bit of the Rain Man there.

436
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:39,086
Ian McShane, which, being British,
it was fantastic to have Ian in our fiIm,

437
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:41,559
because he is a huge actor in Britain,

438
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:43,641
and recentIy, since reaIIy Sexy Beast,

439
00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:45,721
seems to have become a huge star
in the States.

440
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:47,289
Again a briIIiant actor.

441
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:49,129
This is Frank.

442
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:52,121
l'll show you around.

443
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:56,888
We have a fully functioning auto shop,
just like you'd find in the outside world.

444
00:36:56,970 --> 00:37:01,760
Each team has their own shop.
We don't help them. They don't help us.

445
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:04,648
To the inmates, you're Jensen Ames,
the new grease monkey.

446
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:06,960
Nobody will know you're Frank
except us on the team

447
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:08,039
and a handful of the guards.

448
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:11,088
Jacob Vargas on the right pIaying Gunner.

449
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:16,563
We saw him in this movie Bobby,
and he was very, very good in that.

450
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:21,405
And again, we just tried to surround Jason

451
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:24,129
with as many reaIIy strong,
good actors as possibIe,

452
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:28,249
even in the smaIIer parts.
We reaIIy worked hard on that in this fiIm.

453
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:30,048
Casting took a Iong time.

454
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:32,801
That's a good question.

455
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:38,480
Just in generaI, preparation for the fiIm
was very Iong and very eIaborate,

456
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:40,606
because once we had found these Iocations,

457
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:44,922
we then had to kind of tooI
aII of the race scenes to the Iocations,

458
00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:47,524
so that the cars couId reaIIy interact

459
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:50,249
with these fantastic big
warehouses that we had found,

460
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:53,447
with piIIars and, you know,
with bridges and things Iike that.

461
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:55,885
So, you know, we changed a Iot of the script

462
00:37:55,970 --> 00:38:00,282
to fit the Iocation,
which put us back about six months.

463
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:03,328
But I think we got a much better movie
out of it because of that.

464
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:05,560
...there's a 250 hp NOS unit.

465
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:08,169
Just in case.

466
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:13,198
Then we had some fun customising...

467
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:15,645
Mustang, the Monster.

468
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:17,402
We wanted cars that were...

469
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:20,758
PeopIe couId reIate to.

470
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:23,364
Yeah, I mean, I wanted peopIe
to drive down a freeway

471
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:25,884
and recognise aII of the cars from the movie.

472
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:29,565
So that you couId reaIIy imagine,
''Wow... '' You drive past a Mustang,

473
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:31,129
and you can reaIIy imagine how it couId be

474
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:34,088
fitted out with these machine guns
and with the armour pIating.

475
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:37,287
It's certainIy one of my fantasies whenever
somebody cuts me up on the freeway,

476
00:38:37,370 --> 00:38:39,247
it's Iike I aIways imagine,
''God, wouIdn't it be great

477
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:42,003
''if I had a rocket Iauncher
mounted to the front of my car. ''

478
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:48,480
There was an earIier draft where
we had Ferraris and Lamborghinis.

479
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:50,959
But not onIy wouId that have been
extremeIy expensive,

480
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:53,564
we just feIt that...

481
00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:55,447
-It was just too exotic.
-Yeah, exactIy.

482
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:57,725
And we feIt that peopIe
wouIdn't be abIe to reIate to them as much

483
00:38:57,810 --> 00:39:03,168
as you know, a Dodge Ram, a ChrysIer 300,
the Mustang.

484
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:09,328
Even the sIightIy more exotic cars
Iike the Porsche.

485
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:14,325
I mean, it's an oId Porsche, you can pick up
one of those for just a few grand.

486
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:17,322
And that was the thing is,
we wouId buy some of these cars,

487
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:19,480
reaIIy, for just a few thousand doIIars.

488
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:25,566
But then, each of the cars, we'd spend
probabIy $200,000 on doing the car up.

489
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:27,925
Pretty much we had to take away
the entire bodywork,

490
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:32,049
and repIace it with reaI armour pIating.
It is obviousIy very thin in the movie.

491
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:34,325
But it is aII reaI metaI.

492
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:37,049
None of the originaI bodywork is Ieft.

493
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:39,086
The interior of the car, you can see here

494
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:43,243
has roII cages been put in
for protection of the stunt drivers.

495
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:45,924
The suspension had to be aItered
to make it a raIIy suspension,

496
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:49,286
because the road surfaces
were very uneven.

497
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:52,407
The axeIs quite often had to be
beefed up because of aII the extra weight

498
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:55,482
that was added by the armour pIating
and the machine guns.

499
00:39:55,570 --> 00:39:56,844
The engines had to be repIaced

500
00:39:56,930 --> 00:39:59,649
or compIeteIy tuned up,
again because of the weight.

501
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:02,039
We stiII wanted the cars
to be high-performance,

502
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:05,918
even whiIe carrying
aII this extra stuff in them.

503
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:10,085
So it was a Iong process
to manufacture the automobiIes.

504
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:22,329
So again as Jeremy said earIier,
this is a reaI prison yard.

505
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:25,129
AII the exterior shots in the prison
are in a reaI prison,

506
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:27,599
that was decommissioned
about 10 years ago.

507
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:30,204
AII the interior shots,
we wouId do in different Iocations,

508
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:32,008
or we wouId have to buiId.

509
00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:35,002
That's because they had a big
asbestos probIem inside the prison.

510
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:37,888
So we weren't actuaIIy aIIowed
to go inside any of the buiIdings.

511
00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:39,801
...and help with the running of the car.

512
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:42,279
l'd like to talk to her ahead of time,
before the race.

513
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:44,725
Yeah. l'd like a big-tittie girl
to lick peanut butter off my toes.

514
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:46,209
That ain't gonna happen.

515
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:48,440
lt's still a prison, man. She's a chick.

516
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:53,442
Jacob giving us some weII-earned humour.

517
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:57,083
Yeah, Machine Gun Joe is the only one
that has a male navigator.

518
00:40:57,170 --> 00:40:58,364
'Cause he's gay.

519
00:40:58,450 --> 00:41:02,841
Actually, it's 'cause he goes through them
so fast, the audience gets squeamish.

520
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:05,888
Yeah, he goes through them.
Through their ass.

521
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:11,085
He cuts each kill into his skin
as a souvenir, right here.

522
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:13,001
What about the rest of the drivers?

523
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:16,639
I think the interior of the cars
have quite a unique Iook to them.

524
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:19,198
It was something we struggIed with
for ages.

525
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:22,129
And in the end, what we did was,

526
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:25,282
we basicaIIy just took away
a Iot of the kind of dashboard,

527
00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:27,167
a Iot of the kind of pIastic
that you see in a normaI car.

528
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:29,889
We just took it away
and what you're seeing inside the cars

529
00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:33,007
is a Iot of the wiring,
and originaI Iights and everything.

530
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:35,046
So that, kind of, if you deconstruct a car

531
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:37,439
what you get is what you see
inside these cars.

532
00:41:37,530 --> 00:41:39,043
...the Hindu goddess of death, Kali,

533
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:41,405
-and that he is her messenger.
-Cuckoo.

534
00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:45,927
Some of you might recognise
Robin Shou, who pIays 14K.

535
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:50,879
He starred in my very first American movie,
Mortal Kombat.

536
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:53,484
And we worked with him,
he had a smaII roIe,

537
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:56,562
a cameo roIe in a movie
we produced caIIed DOA.

538
00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:59,210
And we Iove Robin, and we aIways wanted
to work with him again,

539
00:41:59,290 --> 00:42:01,599
and I pretty much wrote this roIe for him.

540
00:42:01,930 --> 00:42:03,966
-Used to race for NASCAR.
-Yeah, he was good, too.

541
00:42:04,050 --> 00:42:06,883
And aIso the thing about Robin is,
he just doesn't age.

542
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:08,323
He Iooks exactIy the same now

543
00:42:08,410 --> 00:42:11,368
as he did 15 years ago,
when I first worked with him.

544
00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:14,169
And he had pretty much
the same hair for the Iast 15 years as weII.

545
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:17,799
He has this very Iong,
Iuxuriant, kind of, rather 1980s hair,

546
00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:21,246
I aIways think.
So, aIthough I wrote the roIe for him,

547
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:25,289
I aIso wrote the roIe
so that he had to shave his hair off,

548
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:26,689
which he did wiIIingIy.

549
00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:31,359
But I think it gives him a pretty unique Iook.

550
00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:34,762
You hear a lot.

551
00:42:36,370 --> 00:42:38,281
Who's the new fish?

552
00:42:38,370 --> 00:42:40,600
Tyrese is great.

553
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:42,840
We reaIIy enjoyed working with Tyrese.

554
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:47,048
He's got a great attitude. He is very funny.

555
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:49,246
He's a very good person
to have around on set.

556
00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:52,640
...the ugliest motherfucker
in this prison, yo.

557
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:56,483
Funny, huh?

558
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:03,479
You tell Frank when you see him.

559
00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:06,721
This race is between me and him.

560
00:43:08,010 --> 00:43:10,240
This time won't be no infirmary.

561
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:12,319
lt'll be the morgue.

562
00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:14,128
Tyrese and his whoIe crew.

563
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:18,607
There are a Iot of gangs in the movie.

564
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:22,649
So Tyrese has his own gang,
Pachenko has his own gang,

565
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:24,766
14K has his own gang.

566
00:43:24,850 --> 00:43:27,967
And to kind of get that gang feeIing going,

567
00:43:28,050 --> 00:43:30,928
what I wouId do is
I wouId keep the groups separate,

568
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:32,966
and rather than giving any of the actors

569
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:35,803
who are with
a particuIar gang boss direction,

570
00:43:35,890 --> 00:43:37,209
I wouId aIways aIIow the actors

571
00:43:37,290 --> 00:43:40,646
who are in charge of that gang
to direct their own gang.

572
00:43:40,730 --> 00:43:43,403
And so that they wouId appear
much more Iike the Ieader.

573
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:45,799
And I kind of encouraged that
aII the way through the shoot.

574
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:48,085
So what you got was,
you got Pachenko's gang,

575
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:50,286
they aII wouId just hang out with him.
Even when we weren't shooting

576
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:53,487
they wouId be hanging out with him
during Iunch for exampIe.

577
00:43:53,570 --> 00:43:56,528
They'd go out together at night,
and I think it reaIIy heIped

578
00:43:56,610 --> 00:43:59,647
enhance the, kind of, sIightIy...
The edgy gang feeI.

579
00:43:59,730 --> 00:44:02,290
So when some of these gangs
kind of brush up against one another,

580
00:44:02,370 --> 00:44:04,008
you know, they reaIIy don't get on,

581
00:44:04,090 --> 00:44:06,558
'cause they kind of kept themseIves
to themseIves.

582
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:08,242
That was very smart of you, PauI, to do that.

583
00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:10,605
-I didn't even know you were doing that.
-Yes, I did that.

584
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:11,964
RemarkabIe method. Method direction.

585
00:44:12,810 --> 00:44:14,766
-Yeah.
-Another good CG.

586
00:44:14,850 --> 00:44:16,329
Saved me having to give them any direction.

587
00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:18,449
-And of course...
-Tricks of the trade.

588
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:21,124
What we reaIise is...
Most actors do want to direct anyway,

589
00:44:21,210 --> 00:44:24,043
so Max Ryan who pIayed Pachenko,

590
00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:27,042
and Tyrese, I mean, they just
rose to the occasion magnificentIy.

591
00:44:29,010 --> 00:44:30,841
I think it ended up costing us
quite a bit of money though,

592
00:44:30,930 --> 00:44:33,922
because Tyrese never wanted
to do anything without his gang.

593
00:44:34,690 --> 00:44:36,681
He so much Iiked having them around him,

594
00:44:36,770 --> 00:44:40,558
so we wouId end up having to have
his gang in every singIe scene he was in.

595
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:42,083
Now you teII me.

596
00:44:45,050 --> 00:44:49,123
Jason CIarke, exceIIent
as Joan AIIen's sidekick.

597
00:44:49,210 --> 00:44:50,689
Jason CIarke's in a TVshow Brotherhood,

598
00:44:50,770 --> 00:44:52,522
with a very good friend
of ours Jason Isaacs.

599
00:44:52,610 --> 00:44:54,601
So it was kind of fun to work with him
on this.

600
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:57,648
This is my favourite shot in the fiIm, PauI,
it's just so iconic.

601
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:01,598
We worked very hard on that mask.

602
00:45:01,690 --> 00:45:03,089
To make it something different.

603
00:45:04,810 --> 00:45:06,801
You know, different from the originaI movie.

604
00:45:06,890 --> 00:45:10,246
But aIso, you know, once you start
putting masks on peopIe's faces,

605
00:45:10,330 --> 00:45:14,005
I mean, there's a danger it, kind of,
becomes a bit too comic booky superhero.

606
00:45:14,090 --> 00:45:17,480
So we didn't want him
to Iook Iike Daredevil or Batman.

607
00:45:17,570 --> 00:45:19,765
But then equaIIy, he's got a tough Iook.

608
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:23,763
But you don't want him to Iook
Iike Jason Voorhees either.

609
00:45:23,850 --> 00:45:30,449
So, that kind of organic Iook to the mask
is something that resuIted from,

610
00:45:30,530 --> 00:45:32,248
I think we probabIy deveIoped 20 or 30

611
00:45:32,330 --> 00:45:35,083
different Iooks for the mask
and eventuaIIy ended up on this one.

612
00:45:35,170 --> 00:45:38,367
And the idea is that it is a rusted, beaten,
piece of metaI

613
00:45:38,450 --> 00:45:42,921
that's been actuaIIy beaten out
in one of the auto shops.

614
00:45:43,010 --> 00:45:46,798
So it has kind of a creepy feeI to it,
but aIso a very organic and reaI feeI.

615
00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:51,242
He's all yours.

616
00:45:53,490 --> 00:45:55,606
Don't talk to the other drivers.
Frank never did.

617
00:45:55,690 --> 00:45:57,567
The racing stripe on the side of the costume

618
00:45:57,650 --> 00:46:00,767
was very much inspired
by Steve McQueen in Le Mans.

619
00:46:00,850 --> 00:46:06,686
Yeah, in Le Mans,
McQueen wears a white outfit with a stripe.

620
00:46:06,770 --> 00:46:11,560
So we basicaIIy took the same design for
the costume, but changed aII the coIours.

621
00:46:15,570 --> 00:46:17,845
You see at the end of the raceway there,

622
00:46:17,930 --> 00:46:20,160
there are Iots of containers,
shipping containers,

623
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:22,764
they are hiding beautifuI MontreaI.

624
00:46:22,850 --> 00:46:26,729
And we found that a very cost-effective way
to create our racetrack.

625
00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:29,166
So we wouId just rent
a Iot of shipping containers,

626
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:31,081
paint those Chevron's on them,

627
00:46:31,170 --> 00:46:34,287
and they wouId bIock out bits of the city
that we didn't want to see.

628
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:38,729
I Iove that guy standing there
with his tongue.

629
00:46:38,810 --> 00:46:41,324
-His tongue, yeah.
-Just fantastic.

630
00:46:41,410 --> 00:46:43,082
NataIie Martinez.

631
00:46:44,330 --> 00:46:45,763
BeautifuI girI.

632
00:46:55,090 --> 00:46:58,719
I was a IittIe worried we weren't going to
get this shot of NataIie, because...

633
00:46:58,810 --> 00:47:02,120
-This shot?
-Yeah, because when we were shooting it,

634
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:05,680
I Iooked up and much to my horror,
I discovered that the camera operator

635
00:47:05,770 --> 00:47:09,046
who was in the perfect position
to get the shot of NataIie's bum

636
00:47:09,130 --> 00:47:10,449
was actuaIIy a woman.

637
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:12,600
And I thought, oh no, now,
I'm going to have to go over there

638
00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:17,764
and be very sexist and teII her, ''Remember
to pan down and get NataIie's ass. ''

639
00:47:17,850 --> 00:47:20,569
But fortunateIy she did it magnificentIy.

640
00:47:20,650 --> 00:47:22,720
A good camera operator knows what to do.

641
00:47:22,810 --> 00:47:24,129
Don't sweat it. l know.

642
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:27,122
l drove with Frank. l'll watch your back.

643
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:29,360
That scar on NataIie's face, I Iove.

644
00:47:29,450 --> 00:47:30,644
We actuaIIy Iit...

645
00:47:30,730 --> 00:47:32,880
We changed the Iighting
sIightIy to, kind of, bring it out.

646
00:47:32,970 --> 00:47:36,280
It's not reaIIy as prominent as it appears,
but that's a reaI scar.

647
00:47:36,370 --> 00:47:38,759
And she got it when she was a IittIe kid,

648
00:47:38,850 --> 00:47:40,886
and I think it was her uncIe

649
00:47:40,970 --> 00:47:45,441
who had aII these cocks,

650
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:49,364
and she went into the backyard
and one of them just came at her.

651
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:51,759
And she was very Iucky not to Iose an eye,

652
00:47:51,850 --> 00:47:54,159
but she ended up with that
very distinct scar on her face,

653
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:57,686
which I think is fantastic.
I think it gives her so much character.

654
00:47:58,490 --> 00:48:01,209
How the hell did he drive in that thing?

655
00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:06,759
What?

656
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:09,603
You're better looking than the last Frank.

657
00:48:10,130 --> 00:48:11,563
A few crashes should change that.

658
00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:15,688
Joan AIIen's high-tech controI room.

659
00:48:15,770 --> 00:48:20,400
I wanted Iike a high-tech cocoon
within aII the crumbIing industriaI decay.

660
00:48:20,490 --> 00:48:26,008
One of the fun things about this Iocation
is that everything was reaIIy in pIace.

661
00:48:26,090 --> 00:48:27,569
You know, that controI room we buiIt,

662
00:48:27,650 --> 00:48:29,959
it reaIIy Iooks over the auto shop
in the back.

663
00:48:30,050 --> 00:48:33,565
And through the windows at the front,
you reaIIy see the starting grid.

664
00:48:33,650 --> 00:48:36,722
So, again it kind of saved us.
TraditionaIIy, you wouId buiId that as a set,

665
00:48:36,810 --> 00:48:40,041
and then you wouId have to do visuaI
effects for the shots through the window.

666
00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:41,722
I'm so gIad we did it practicaIIy.

667
00:48:44,370 --> 00:48:47,567
Access to over 100 live camera feeds.

668
00:48:48,450 --> 00:48:52,238
This whoIe thing is very much inspired by
reaI pay-per-view events that you can see.

669
00:48:52,330 --> 00:48:53,843
Like HBO boxing and things Iike that.

670
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:55,886
We just kind of wanted to
take it to the next IeveI.

671
00:48:56,810 --> 00:48:59,563
...featuring four-time winner Frankenstein.

672
00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:02,644
Three-time winner Machine Gun Joe.

673
00:49:03,130 --> 00:49:04,404
Pachenko.

674
00:49:05,770 --> 00:49:07,567
Travis Colt.

675
00:49:07,650 --> 00:49:11,120
Audience favourite Frankenstein
resumes his bitter grudge match

676
00:49:11,210 --> 00:49:12,609
with Machine Gun Joe.

677
00:49:12,690 --> 00:49:16,046
Frankenstein returns to the track
after a six-month absence.

678
00:49:16,130 --> 00:49:18,007
They've missed him.

679
00:49:18,090 --> 00:49:20,399
He's the man that just won't die.

680
00:49:21,730 --> 00:49:26,326
Twelve million hits on his angle alone.
He hasn't even started the engine.

681
00:49:27,050 --> 00:49:29,484
We'll do 45 million viewers today.

682
00:49:34,050 --> 00:49:35,961
So, what are you in for?

683
00:49:36,770 --> 00:49:38,761
They say l killed a cop.

684
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:42,085
-Did you do it?
-Yeah.

685
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:45,720
I Iove the wreck-tech feeI
of the interior of these cars.

686
00:49:45,810 --> 00:49:49,405
You know, the seats they are sitting in
are reaI ejector seats

687
00:49:49,490 --> 00:49:52,562
that we took from an oId fighter jet.

688
00:49:52,650 --> 00:49:53,924
Frank, Case, you read me?

689
00:49:54,370 --> 00:49:59,728
The triggers that are on the steering wheeI
for the guns are actuaIIy... They're driIIs.

690
00:50:02,130 --> 00:50:06,408
So, it just triggers from eIectric driIIs.

691
00:50:06,490 --> 00:50:08,606
It's got a reaI and rough ready feeI to it.

692
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:16,641
I Iike the bundIes of metaI cords...

693
00:50:16,730 --> 00:50:19,005
-WeII, we found those in scrap metaI yards.
-Yeah.

694
00:50:19,090 --> 00:50:23,720
A Iot of the movie, our production designer,
PauI Austerberry, did a fantastic job

695
00:50:23,810 --> 00:50:27,849
of just basicaIIy combing scrap
metaI yards, and finding interesting items

696
00:50:27,930 --> 00:50:30,967
that we couId buy for next to nothing
to kind of use.

697
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:37,528
And those steeI bundIes were very
important, obviousIy, to kind of protect

698
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:40,329
the actors and aIso the stuntmen
from one another.

699
00:50:40,410 --> 00:50:42,765
You know, when those cars
are driving by at high speed,

700
00:50:42,850 --> 00:50:45,887
you know, they reaIIy did provide
a fantastic crash barrier

701
00:50:45,970 --> 00:50:48,928
just in case one of the cars
wouId spin out of controI.

702
00:50:49,010 --> 00:50:53,800
So gIad we Ieft the ChrysIer
with some orange on it.

703
00:50:54,730 --> 00:50:56,288
ReaIIy stands out.

704
00:50:57,690 --> 00:51:03,162
I've aIways seen this movie as much
a kind of war movie as a race movie,

705
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:06,879
and I aIways knew that we wouId have
some very frenetic action scenes

706
00:51:06,970 --> 00:51:08,801
and some very fast cutting.

707
00:51:08,890 --> 00:51:11,927
I wanted the audience to be abIe to identify
which car was which

708
00:51:12,010 --> 00:51:14,683
and who was in which car very, very quickIy.

709
00:51:14,770 --> 00:51:16,123
So we had to make nine cars,

710
00:51:16,210 --> 00:51:21,000
and each one had to have its own separate
identity and its own separate profiIe.

711
00:51:21,090 --> 00:51:25,561
And I think we puIIed that off.
It wasn't the easiest thing, though.

712
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:28,039
One of the things was...
The ChrysIer, for exampIe,

713
00:51:28,130 --> 00:51:31,600
is one of the few cars
that has a spIash of coIour.

714
00:51:31,690 --> 00:51:33,487
That's right, there's the red
on the front of the Monster,

715
00:51:33,570 --> 00:51:35,800
and the orange on the ChrysIer.

716
00:51:35,890 --> 00:51:39,485
And Pachenko's car has a Iight coIour to it.

717
00:51:45,250 --> 00:51:48,242
So aII the racing stuff you're seeing here
is totaIIy practicaI.

718
00:51:50,050 --> 00:51:54,407
Some of the driving is being done
by Jason for reaI,

719
00:51:54,490 --> 00:51:56,128
some of the interior stuff that you're seeing.

720
00:51:56,210 --> 00:52:01,079
Some of it is on a stage
with green screen behind them.

721
00:52:02,970 --> 00:52:09,159
We did that because it's very, very difficuIt
to mount cameras on a car

722
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:12,765
and get a reaI performance out of somebody
when there's diaIogue invoIved.

723
00:52:12,850 --> 00:52:17,640
It's better if it can be
a sIightIy more controIIed environment.

724
00:52:17,730 --> 00:52:19,880
But then, what we wouId do is,
for a Iot of the racing stuff

725
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,608
where the cars
are just bashing into one another

726
00:52:21,690 --> 00:52:24,079
we wouId actuaIIy,
physicaIIy, have Jason in the car

727
00:52:24,170 --> 00:52:28,561
and Iet him drive down the track
and Iet stunt cars bash into him.

728
00:52:28,650 --> 00:52:31,005
Because there was no diaIogue invoIved.

729
00:52:31,090 --> 00:52:34,048
Except when it was... I mean Jason
wouId have done every stunt possibIe,

730
00:52:34,130 --> 00:52:35,768
but there were some things
that were so dangerous,

731
00:52:35,850 --> 00:52:37,169
I just couIdn't Iet him do it.

732
00:52:43,530 --> 00:52:45,043
Wakey-wakey!

733
00:52:46,890 --> 00:52:49,529
So everything up untiI this point in the race
was in AIstom,

734
00:52:49,610 --> 00:52:51,885
which was the train factory we found.

735
00:52:53,810 --> 00:52:57,439
At this point, now, we transfer
to our second major Iocation,

736
00:52:57,530 --> 00:53:01,523
which was an abandoned siIo
in the harbour of MontreaI.

737
00:53:07,210 --> 00:53:10,202
What was great about this
was it was reaIIy a two-kiIometre run,

738
00:53:10,290 --> 00:53:12,440
so we couId reaIIy get the cars up to speed.

739
00:53:12,530 --> 00:53:13,849
There was water on one side,

740
00:53:13,930 --> 00:53:17,764
which aIIowed me to get a heIicopter down
nice and Iow and track with the cars.

741
00:53:18,970 --> 00:53:21,279
l know what the hell l'm doing.

742
00:53:22,210 --> 00:53:23,609
What you gonna do?

743
00:53:36,770 --> 00:53:40,809
You can't go head-to-head with Joe like this.
He'll tear you apart.

744
00:53:43,250 --> 00:53:44,365
You read me?

745
00:53:45,970 --> 00:53:50,566
Even when we were doing some of
the green screen stuff inside the cars,

746
00:53:50,650 --> 00:53:55,041
the cars wouId aII be mounted
on hydrauIic pIatforms,

747
00:53:55,130 --> 00:53:58,964
so that we'd reaIIy be
shaking the cars around a Iot.

748
00:53:59,050 --> 00:54:00,961
It was very, very vioIent in there.

749
00:54:01,050 --> 00:54:04,486
So, for exampIe,
where we had to have a scene where

750
00:54:04,570 --> 00:54:10,202
the Monster gets rammed by Joe's car,
we wouId reaIIy shake the car hugeIy.

751
00:54:10,290 --> 00:54:13,441
It was very uncomfortabIe for the actors
and very uncomfortabIe for the camera crew,

752
00:54:13,530 --> 00:54:15,885
'cause they were strapped
to the exterior of the car

753
00:54:15,970 --> 00:54:17,289
and they were being shaken around a Iot.

754
00:54:18,930 --> 00:54:20,522
The camera crew wouId...

755
00:54:20,610 --> 00:54:22,646
I've never seen a camera crew
wear so many hard hats

756
00:54:22,730 --> 00:54:25,449
and so much protective cIothing
as they did on this movie.

757
00:54:27,050 --> 00:54:28,961
It was a tough shoot.

758
00:54:29,050 --> 00:54:31,245
l know. l've seen this race before.

759
00:54:33,290 --> 00:54:35,121
These cars are reaIIy traveIIing
at speed, as weII.

760
00:54:35,210 --> 00:54:38,247
I mean, they're not, as is so often the case,

761
00:54:38,330 --> 00:54:42,243
traveIIing sIow, and then we, through
the magic of cinema make it Iook fast.

762
00:54:42,330 --> 00:54:46,403
I mean, they were going
at 50, 60, 70 miIes an hour.

763
00:54:46,490 --> 00:54:50,244
Yeah, 60 is the kind of magic number
that you try and hit,

764
00:54:50,330 --> 00:54:53,720
because 60 Iooks reaIIy fast.

765
00:54:53,810 --> 00:54:56,449
And interestingIy, the difference
between 60 miIes an hour

766
00:54:56,530 --> 00:54:59,647
and 100 miIes an hour
when you fiIm it, it's not much.

767
00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:02,039
You can't reaIIy teII
that much of a difference,

768
00:55:02,130 --> 00:55:03,927
but you can sure teII a Iot of difference

769
00:55:04,010 --> 00:55:06,444
between 50 miIes an hour
and 60 miIes an hour.

770
00:55:06,530 --> 00:55:09,681
So we tried to get the cars
up to 60 wherever we couId.

771
00:55:11,050 --> 00:55:13,484
Of course what was very dangerous
about this movie

772
00:55:13,570 --> 00:55:16,960
was just the Iocations we were shooting in,
the environment.

773
00:55:17,050 --> 00:55:21,328
You know, this wasn't a reaI racetrack,
there were huge big, metaI piIIars,

774
00:55:21,410 --> 00:55:26,564
Iumps of concrete, bits of rebar,
it was very dangerous for the stunt drivers.

775
00:55:26,650 --> 00:55:28,686
-This is so nasty, PauI.
-Thank you.

776
00:55:28,770 --> 00:55:32,160
I mean, this guy
is just being totaIIy crushed.

777
00:55:33,650 --> 00:55:37,563
I do Iike constructing action scenes
where it has severaI IeveIs to it.

778
00:55:37,650 --> 00:55:40,039
You think something's reaIIy cooI
and then something eIse happens,

779
00:55:40,130 --> 00:55:42,086
and then again something eIse happens.

780
00:55:42,170 --> 00:55:44,126
And that's what I thought about, the spikes,

781
00:55:44,210 --> 00:55:46,724
I think it's so great they come out
of the ground and the car hits them.

782
00:55:46,810 --> 00:55:50,359
I mean, it's reaIIy satisfying,
but what's even more satisfying than that

783
00:55:50,450 --> 00:55:54,125
is when the spikes sink down
and kind of chop the car up.

784
00:55:56,530 --> 00:56:01,160
We wanted to make each section of the race
have its particuIar character.

785
00:56:01,250 --> 00:56:03,889
We were worried that if it was just driving,
it wouId become repetitive,

786
00:56:03,970 --> 00:56:05,801
so we introduced these obstacIes.

787
00:56:07,890 --> 00:56:12,042
It aIso, I suppose, gives
the whoIe experience a bit of a game feeI.

788
00:56:12,130 --> 00:56:15,088
Yeah, the idea of the symboIs on the ground

789
00:56:15,170 --> 00:56:18,606
were definiteIy to make the race
more interactive.

790
00:56:18,690 --> 00:56:22,478
So it wasn't just going around a track,
there's strategy invoIved.

791
00:56:23,690 --> 00:56:27,080
Sometimes, in this race,
the worst pIace to be is up in front

792
00:56:27,170 --> 00:56:28,842
because you're in somebody's gun sights.

793
00:56:28,930 --> 00:56:32,718
But you have to be up in front
if you're going to grab the symboIs first.

794
00:56:32,810 --> 00:56:38,168
So it added a whoIe Iayer of strategy
to the race, which I feIt was important.

795
00:56:39,290 --> 00:56:43,442
And these were, obviousIy, inspired
by power-ups from numerous video games.

796
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:49,486
Again, this is aII reaI machine gun fire.

797
00:56:49,570 --> 00:56:53,768
Those are reaI caItrops
dropping out of the back of that car.

798
00:56:55,090 --> 00:56:57,524
-This is Grimm's car, this is aII practicaI.
-AII reaI.

799
00:56:57,610 --> 00:56:59,407
-There's no CG here at aII.
-AII reaI.

800
00:57:06,010 --> 00:57:08,365
That was actuaIIy a mistake.

801
00:57:08,450 --> 00:57:10,725
That car originaIIy was supposed to spin

802
00:57:10,810 --> 00:57:13,961
about five feet into the air
and hit the bottom of the sign.

803
00:57:14,050 --> 00:57:18,282
But when you do things practicaI,
unexpected things happen.

804
00:57:18,370 --> 00:57:23,603
And the car ended up going about 30 feet
in the air and hitting the top of the sign.

805
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:26,284
Made no sense whatsoever,
because the car originaIIy

806
00:57:26,370 --> 00:57:28,838
was supposed to
just spin out of controI and crash.

807
00:57:28,930 --> 00:57:32,764
But we ended up with aII this fantastic
footage of it being 30 or 40 feet in the air,

808
00:57:32,850 --> 00:57:35,239
and then we, kind of, backtracked

809
00:57:35,330 --> 00:57:37,639
and I came up with the idea
that it shouId be hit

810
00:57:37,730 --> 00:57:42,201
by a missiIe to motivate it
fIying up in the air Iike that.

811
00:57:42,290 --> 00:57:46,602
So that was kind of a happy accident,
bit of fiIm that went wrong

812
00:57:46,690 --> 00:57:49,887
and then we ended up with something
much more spectacuIar because of that.

813
00:57:50,330 --> 00:57:53,163
We're streaming to 46 million viewers,
ma'am.

814
00:57:55,930 --> 00:58:00,446
Grimm getting spIattered there,
of course, is a visuaI effect.

815
00:58:02,930 --> 00:58:05,922
Life is not so cheap in Canada
that we couId do that for reaI.

816
00:58:08,930 --> 00:58:10,966
Offensive weapons are up.

817
00:58:11,050 --> 00:58:12,165
lt's on.

818
00:58:14,930 --> 00:58:19,606
Now, this is a scene that, again,
was cut out of the theatricaI version.

819
00:58:19,690 --> 00:58:22,363
It's a scene I Iike very much,
we spent a Iot of time shooting it,

820
00:58:22,450 --> 00:58:24,839
NataIie was a reaI sport.

821
00:58:24,930 --> 00:58:27,205
She wouId reaIIy Iean out of the car,
as you can see.

822
00:58:27,290 --> 00:58:28,769
There's no green screen here.

823
00:58:28,850 --> 00:58:31,364
I mean, she's reaIIy Ieaning out of that car,
smashing away,

824
00:58:31,450 --> 00:58:34,681
trying to free up the jammed sheII
in the machine guns.

825
00:58:36,730 --> 00:58:40,405
But when we cut the whoIe movie together,
we feIt a coupIe of things.

826
00:58:40,490 --> 00:58:42,367
One, the race was very Iong.

827
00:58:42,450 --> 00:58:45,999
This first race was about 12 minutes Iong
in the movie.

828
00:58:46,090 --> 00:58:47,842
With this scene in it,
it was about 15 minutes

829
00:58:47,930 --> 00:58:50,046
and just seemed to go on a IittIe too Iong.

830
00:58:50,130 --> 00:58:54,282
Too much good stuff
which can be seIf-defeating after a whiIe.

831
00:58:54,370 --> 00:58:57,680
And aIso there was an eIement
which I just didn't reaIIy beIieve.

832
00:58:57,770 --> 00:58:58,998
I just feIt there's no way

833
00:58:59,090 --> 00:59:01,365
she couId have been hanging
out of that car for so Iong

834
00:59:01,450 --> 00:59:03,486
without getting her head bIown off.

835
00:59:05,210 --> 00:59:07,883
So painfuI though it was,
we took it out of the movie.

836
00:59:07,970 --> 00:59:10,484
And I don't think you miss it
in the finished fiIm,

837
00:59:10,570 --> 00:59:12,686
but I'm very gIad to see it back here.

838
00:59:35,490 --> 00:59:36,923
-Thank you.
-My pleasure.

839
00:59:37,570 --> 00:59:39,162
Shield up ahead!

840
00:59:40,290 --> 00:59:41,962
That son of a bitch!

841
00:59:42,050 --> 00:59:44,405
He just stole a shield from Colt!

842
00:59:45,410 --> 00:59:47,162
Defence weapons are on.

843
00:59:50,250 --> 00:59:54,482
Those guns on the side of Tyrese,
Machine Gun Joe's Dodge Ram

844
00:59:54,570 --> 00:59:56,208
are actuaIIy from a heIicopter.

845
00:59:56,290 --> 00:59:58,645
Yeah, they're caIIed VuIcan cannons.

846
00:59:58,730 --> 01:00:01,688
They're usuaIIy mounted on
BIack Hawk heIicopter gunships.

847
01:00:01,770 --> 01:00:04,409
And we had to get a speciaI export Iicence

848
01:00:04,490 --> 01:00:07,926
for these two guns
from the American miIitary,

849
01:00:08,010 --> 01:00:12,401
because, obviousIy, they don't Iike the guns
traveIIing out of the United States.

850
01:00:12,490 --> 01:00:15,402
So it was a big deaI
to get those guns into Canada.

851
01:00:15,490 --> 01:00:18,368
They shoot 6,000 rounds per minute.

852
01:00:18,450 --> 01:00:19,929
Huge firepower.

853
01:00:21,210 --> 01:00:22,529
And that just gives you a IittIe indication,

854
01:00:22,610 --> 01:00:24,566
that shot there
with aII those sheIIs tumbIing.

855
01:00:26,330 --> 01:00:27,558
Coach!

856
01:00:27,650 --> 01:00:30,369
The tombstone won't take
much more of this.

857
01:00:31,170 --> 01:00:34,640
Frank, Case, those 50 calibre shells
will be through the tombstone

858
01:00:34,730 --> 01:00:35,765
in a matter of seconds.

859
01:00:35,850 --> 01:00:38,489
My advice, either lose him or kill him.

860
01:00:40,050 --> 01:00:44,885
-Travis CoIt in his racing green Jaguar XJS.
-My favourite car.

861
01:00:44,970 --> 01:00:48,246
CIassic '80s car. My father had one.

862
01:00:50,530 --> 01:00:52,441
Without the machine guns, obviousIy.

863
01:00:52,530 --> 01:00:54,361
-Get on my lap.
-What?

864
01:00:54,450 --> 01:00:55,565
Get on my lap.

865
01:00:58,050 --> 01:00:59,722
One of the fun things
about this sequence is,

866
01:00:59,810 --> 01:01:02,961
originaIIy it was conceived
to be done outside,

867
01:01:03,050 --> 01:01:08,807
because it was a car on fire, being T-boned,

868
01:01:08,890 --> 01:01:10,369
spinning 30 feet into the air.

869
01:01:10,450 --> 01:01:13,442
There was no way that we couId conceive
that this couId be done as an interior.

870
01:01:13,530 --> 01:01:17,569
And then when we found this Iocation,
this train factory in MontreaI,

871
01:01:17,650 --> 01:01:20,881
I reconceived the race sequence
to be inside,

872
01:01:20,970 --> 01:01:25,441
'cause I thought, again,
these are some spectacuIar stunts

873
01:01:25,530 --> 01:01:29,079
that have never reaIIy been attempted
in an interior space.

874
01:01:29,170 --> 01:01:32,287
And I think they become even more
spectacuIar when you see them inside.

875
01:01:32,370 --> 01:01:37,922
WeII, it's more dangerous, I mean,
you're cIoser to waIIs and girders and roofs.

876
01:01:38,010 --> 01:01:40,729
-That was aII done for reaI.
-Yeah, I mean, if you think about it...

877
01:01:40,810 --> 01:01:42,846
Yeah, that was aII reaI. If that was outside,

878
01:01:42,930 --> 01:01:46,161
you Iose controI of one of the cars,
it's fine, you just kind of spin out.

879
01:01:46,250 --> 01:01:48,445
You Iose controI of one of the cars
in this kind of environment,

880
01:01:48,530 --> 01:01:51,328
you can hit one of those metaI posts
at 60 miIes an hour,

881
01:01:51,410 --> 01:01:53,446
and that is not a happy resuIt.

882
01:01:55,250 --> 01:01:58,287
And again, just those cars
coming through those doorways,

883
01:01:58,370 --> 01:02:00,679
they are traveIIing at speed, so again, the...

884
01:02:00,770 --> 01:02:03,159
ReaIIy fantastic work
from the stunt drivers here.

885
01:02:06,010 --> 01:02:07,329
Where's he going?

886
01:02:07,410 --> 01:02:10,049
A shortcut. Punch it. We can beat him.

887
01:02:18,090 --> 01:02:21,287
I Iove Pachenko's car. I think it's one
of my favourites in the movie.

888
01:02:21,370 --> 01:02:23,930
It's a 1966 Riviera,

889
01:02:24,010 --> 01:02:27,525
and I had the idea to give it
a chop roof, to Iower the roof,

890
01:02:27,610 --> 01:02:29,601
which compIeteIy aIters the Iines of the car

891
01:02:29,690 --> 01:02:32,921
and gives it that very, kind of,
menacing aImost tank-Iike feeI.

892
01:02:36,530 --> 01:02:40,921
Grimm, Colt and Siad are gone.
Six remaining drivers alive.

Subscribe to Stage 2 now!

894
01:02:52,450 --> 01:02:56,568
I Iove the condition this car's in,
it just had the heII kicked out of it.

895
01:02:56,650 --> 01:02:58,800
But it's one of the interesting chaIIenges
of the movie

896
01:02:58,890 --> 01:03:02,007
is when you do a normaI car movie,
the car pretty much...

897
01:03:02,090 --> 01:03:04,888
Like a NASCAR movie
Iike Days of Thunder or something Iike that,

898
01:03:04,970 --> 01:03:07,200
or The Fast and the Furious,

899
01:03:07,290 --> 01:03:10,600
the car Iooks the same
throughout the race sequence.

900
01:03:10,690 --> 01:03:11,964
What was interesting about this fiIm,

901
01:03:12,050 --> 01:03:15,645
and I say interesting, but what I reaIIy mean
is a huge amount of work,

902
01:03:15,730 --> 01:03:19,962
is every time a machine gun shot
at one of these cars, it wouId do damage,

903
01:03:20,050 --> 01:03:24,123
which meant continuity-wise
the damage had to be refIected in the fiIm.

904
01:03:24,210 --> 01:03:27,122
And, of course, when you make a movie
you shoot things out of continuity.

905
01:03:27,210 --> 01:03:30,168
So some days you wouId be shooting
a scene where the car had to be cIean,

906
01:03:30,250 --> 01:03:33,003
then, in the next shot,
because that was from a different scene,

907
01:03:33,090 --> 01:03:34,762
the car had to have so many buIIet hoIes

908
01:03:34,850 --> 01:03:37,205
in the back, some in the front,
some in the side.

909
01:03:37,290 --> 01:03:40,441
Then you couId do another shot
where the damage had to be even greater,

910
01:03:40,530 --> 01:03:43,727
then you do a fourth shot
and the damage had to be gone compIeteIy.

911
01:03:43,810 --> 01:03:45,562
So it meant
when we were designing the cars,

912
01:03:45,650 --> 01:03:48,403
we had to make
each of these paneIs very moduIar.

913
01:03:48,490 --> 01:03:53,120
So that we couId Iift off, for exampIe, a back
tombstone and put a new tombstone on.

914
01:03:53,210 --> 01:03:55,678
Because at the start of a shooting day,
we might want it cIean

915
01:03:55,770 --> 01:04:00,639
and then by the end, we might want
buIIet hoIes aII over the pIace.

916
01:04:00,730 --> 01:04:04,120
And that was a huge chaIIenge.

917
01:04:04,210 --> 01:04:07,202
I mean, just to keep track
of what the cars shouId be Iooking Iike,

918
01:04:07,290 --> 01:04:09,724
and to constantIy
take these paneIs off and on.

919
01:04:11,610 --> 01:04:13,601
What can l do for you, Mr Ames?

920
01:04:13,690 --> 01:04:15,328
You sure are lucky a driver like me

921
01:04:15,410 --> 01:04:16,638
just happened to turn up...

922
01:04:16,730 --> 01:04:21,679
That scene between UIrich and Statham

923
01:04:21,770 --> 01:04:23,362
again is a scene that we took out

924
01:04:23,450 --> 01:04:26,760
for the originaI
theatricaI version of the movie.

925
01:04:26,850 --> 01:04:29,648
I Iike it. I think it's a good IittIe
character moment between them,

926
01:04:29,730 --> 01:04:32,563
but Jason was giving UIrich
so much attitude,

927
01:04:32,650 --> 01:04:35,687
I kind of feIt
that it undermined UIrich as a viIIain

928
01:04:35,770 --> 01:04:39,365
and as a credibIe threat to him.
So uItimateIy we took that out.

929
01:04:39,450 --> 01:04:40,644
One of the chaIIenges of the fiIm

930
01:04:40,730 --> 01:04:46,123
is there are essentiaIIy three viIIains,
actuaIIy four,

931
01:04:46,210 --> 01:04:48,804
Joan AIIen's character, UIrich,

932
01:04:48,890 --> 01:04:53,759
Pachenko, and aIso
the Machine Gun Joe character is not a...

933
01:04:53,850 --> 01:04:56,922
InitiaIIy anyway,
he's not a heroic, good character.

934
01:04:57,010 --> 01:05:02,368
And managing and maintaining the baIance
between them aII was quite difficuIt.

935
01:05:02,450 --> 01:05:06,238
Yeah, 'cause in a traditionaI movie structure,
you have kind of Iike...

936
01:05:06,330 --> 01:05:09,447
You have the uItimate viIIain
who tends to be the brains of the operation,

937
01:05:09,530 --> 01:05:11,282
Iike AIan Rickman in Die Hard.

938
01:05:11,370 --> 01:05:16,524
And then you have the muscIe,
who's kind of Iike the enforcer character.

939
01:05:16,610 --> 01:05:20,000
But to have Iike four viIIainous
roIes in a movie,

940
01:05:20,090 --> 01:05:24,481
Iike Jeremy said, it was a bit of a struggIe
to make them aII work.

941
01:05:24,570 --> 01:05:26,083
And aII be a credibIe threat to Jason

942
01:05:26,170 --> 01:05:31,039
'cause Jason is such a strong actor as weII
and such a strong physicaI presence.

943
01:05:31,130 --> 01:05:36,727
And we found with UIrich in particuIar,
the head guard, sometimes Iess was more.

944
01:05:36,810 --> 01:05:38,084
You know, he was a very...

945
01:05:38,170 --> 01:05:41,207
He Iooked very cooI.
I reaIIy Iiked his Iook a Iot,

946
01:05:41,290 --> 01:05:44,600
and sometimes if he said too much,
it undermined his threat.

947
01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:47,250
So he ended up...
I think he's a very good force in the movie,

948
01:05:47,330 --> 01:05:50,845
but he's a IittIe more siIent in the movie
than was originaIIy intended.

949
01:05:51,250 --> 01:05:54,686
l wonder what he'll say
when l ask him why he did it.

950
01:05:54,770 --> 01:05:58,399
Why don't you look in a mirror? Ask him.

951
01:05:59,970 --> 01:06:03,849
Poor Piper. lt must be hard
growing up with that knowledge.

952
01:06:04,730 --> 01:06:07,290
That your father killed your mother.

953
01:06:14,090 --> 01:06:15,489
That's great,

954
01:06:16,250 --> 01:06:18,400
gun pointed right at his groin.

955
01:06:27,090 --> 01:06:28,842
You wanted a monster.

956
01:06:30,090 --> 01:06:31,842
Well, you've got one.

957
01:06:35,890 --> 01:06:37,403
The American fIag again.

958
01:06:49,090 --> 01:06:52,321
Sort of reminds me of Shawshank,
some of this imagery.

959
01:06:53,650 --> 01:06:56,767
WeII, the prison probabIy dates from
roughIy the same period as that prison.

960
01:06:56,850 --> 01:06:58,727
AIthough, that was a red brick prison,

961
01:06:58,810 --> 01:07:01,119
I think they were constructed
at roughIy the same time.

962
01:07:01,210 --> 01:07:02,723
Yeah.

963
01:07:02,810 --> 01:07:05,529
It's the interesting thing
about prisons is reaIIy,

964
01:07:05,610 --> 01:07:08,761
they perfected Iocking men away
about 200 years ago,

965
01:07:08,850 --> 01:07:11,284
and the technoIogy
reaIIy hasn't changed at aII.

966
01:07:12,610 --> 01:07:15,966
And there are pIenty of oId prisons Iike this
that are stiII in use.

967
01:07:16,770 --> 01:07:20,809
The simple fact is, the world's changed
since l've been in here.

968
01:07:20,890 --> 01:07:24,087
Don't know it. Don't much want to. But this?

969
01:07:25,530 --> 01:07:26,929
This l know.

970
01:07:27,250 --> 01:07:29,923
The movie has a very de-saturated feeI to it,

971
01:07:30,010 --> 01:07:35,130
and that's partIy in the digitaI grade
that we did in postproduction.

972
01:07:35,210 --> 01:07:39,761
But mainIy it's something that was kind of
suggested to me just by the Iocations.

973
01:07:39,850 --> 01:07:43,968
We were shooting in a Iot of Iocations
that had been kind of abandoned,

974
01:07:44,050 --> 01:07:47,247
and the paint work had been fading
for a Iong time.

975
01:07:47,330 --> 01:07:49,286
So it was a very muted coIour paIette

976
01:07:49,370 --> 01:07:51,804
that we were working with
in the principaI photography.

977
01:07:51,890 --> 01:07:54,927
And then I just took that
a IittIe bit further in postproduction.

978
01:07:55,010 --> 01:07:57,922
So reaIIy the onIy coIourfuI things
in the movie are,

979
01:07:58,010 --> 01:08:01,480
you know, the end of the movie, obviousIy,
in Mexico,

980
01:08:01,570 --> 01:08:03,003
which is a compIeteIy different feeI.

981
01:08:03,090 --> 01:08:04,079
But aIso in the body of the movie,

982
01:08:04,170 --> 01:08:06,638
it tends to just be
Iike the red spIash of the bIood,

983
01:08:06,730 --> 01:08:09,642
the red stripe on the Monster,
on Jason's outfit,

984
01:08:09,730 --> 01:08:11,209
and that was a very deIiberate choice

985
01:08:11,290 --> 01:08:15,203
was to keep those primary coIours
to a minimum,

986
01:08:15,290 --> 01:08:17,884
and reaIIy onIy have punchy coIour
every so often.

987
01:08:22,650 --> 01:08:24,288
Her name was Suzy.

988
01:08:25,090 --> 01:08:29,368
Which feeds into your generaI idea
of keeping the fiIm as reaI as possibIe,

989
01:08:29,450 --> 01:08:32,647
and underIining that wherever you couId.

990
01:08:32,730 --> 01:08:33,958
She didn't.

991
01:08:34,290 --> 01:08:39,410
Yeah, I didn't want to impose
a kind of a styIised Iook on the fiIm.

992
01:08:39,490 --> 01:08:41,208
That's what I said
to aII the heads of department is,

993
01:08:41,290 --> 01:08:44,362
I want the movie to Iook styIish
but I don't want it to Iook styIised.

994
01:08:44,450 --> 01:08:46,964
I don't want it to Iook
Iike we're trying too hard,

995
01:08:47,050 --> 01:08:50,599
and I don't want the fiImmaking to get
in the way of the audience experience.

996
01:08:50,850 --> 01:08:54,320
Sometimes you watch a movie, it's Iike
the fiImmaker is being right in your face.

997
01:08:54,410 --> 01:08:57,129
It's Iike, ''Look at me, I'm cIever,
Iook at this cIever camera move.

998
01:08:57,210 --> 01:08:59,246
''Look at how styIish this is. ''

999
01:08:59,330 --> 01:09:02,083
And, you know,
I obviousIy Iike styIish-Iooking movies,

1000
01:09:02,170 --> 01:09:05,287
but I wanted it to be styIish
without being styIised,

1001
01:09:05,370 --> 01:09:07,679
without the fiImmaking being too obvious.

1002
01:09:18,450 --> 01:09:21,726
This is one of our few visuaI effects,

1003
01:09:21,810 --> 01:09:24,643
'cause obviousIy,
Tyrese didn't sIice into his own cheek.

1004
01:09:24,730 --> 01:09:27,369
Much though he is a committed actor.

1005
01:09:27,450 --> 01:09:30,886
-There is a Iimit.
-Yes, exactIy. UnderstandabIy so.

1006
01:09:32,330 --> 01:09:34,127
''Thou shalt not...''

1007
01:09:39,250 --> 01:09:43,004
I got this idea of him scarring himseIf
from Iooking at Iot of keIoid scars

1008
01:09:43,090 --> 01:09:47,322
that are very popuIar
amongst certain African warrior tribes,

1009
01:09:47,410 --> 01:09:49,799
where the keIoid scarring
is deIiberateIy done

1010
01:09:49,890 --> 01:09:54,122
to show your position within the tribe
and how great a warrior you are.

1011
01:09:54,210 --> 01:09:59,523
And, you know, I feIt that,
that was kind of a good Iook for Tyrese.

1012
01:09:59,610 --> 01:10:03,398
You know, originaIIy,
he marked the kiIIs on the side of his car,

1013
01:10:03,490 --> 01:10:07,039
Iike a First WorId War fighter piIot
or a Second WorId War fighter piIot.

1014
01:10:07,130 --> 01:10:10,600
And then I thought, how much cooIer
if he actuaIIy marks them on his own fIesh.

1015
01:10:14,170 --> 01:10:15,922
Maybe you're right.

1016
01:10:16,850 --> 01:10:19,205
l will take that break after all.

1017
01:10:24,650 --> 01:10:25,924
Good call.

1018
01:10:27,850 --> 01:10:29,283
It was freezing coId this night,

1019
01:10:29,370 --> 01:10:33,443
as you can probabIy teII from the breath
coming out of everyone's mouths.

1020
01:10:33,530 --> 01:10:35,998
And this was a fantastic Iocation,
the auto shop,

1021
01:10:36,090 --> 01:10:39,526
but because of aII the gIass,
we reaIIy had to...

1022
01:10:39,610 --> 01:10:41,487
NormaIIy a scene Iike this,
which is aII set at night,

1023
01:10:41,570 --> 01:10:44,642
you'd shoot in the middIe of the day
and you'd just bIack out the windows.

1024
01:10:44,730 --> 01:10:47,085
There were so many windows here
that wasn't possibIe.

1025
01:10:47,170 --> 01:10:51,402
So we ended up having to shoot this
fight scene aII the way through the night.

1026
01:10:51,490 --> 01:10:54,084
So, a Iot of this...
This is tough physicaI stuff.

1027
01:10:54,690 --> 01:10:57,921
Jason's having to do it
at 3.:00, 4.:00 in the morning.

1028
01:10:59,850 --> 01:11:01,442
Looking for me?

1029
01:11:01,570 --> 01:11:03,720
And again, he wanted reaIity, as I did.

1030
01:11:03,810 --> 01:11:06,119
So that's a reaI chain
wrapped around his neck.

1031
01:11:07,570 --> 01:11:11,324
His neck by the end of this scene,
it took us two nights to fiIm this fight,

1032
01:11:11,410 --> 01:11:15,562
Jason's neck just Iooked Iike hamburger.
It was reaIIy red raw,

1033
01:11:15,650 --> 01:11:18,926
'cause that chain
had been dragged around his neck so much.

1034
01:11:19,010 --> 01:11:22,400
We reaIIy wanted to make the fight
as reaI as possibIe,

1035
01:11:22,490 --> 01:11:28,008
particuIarIy as Jason has done the more
martiaI arts-based fights in Transporter.

1036
01:11:28,090 --> 01:11:32,402
And for me this, more than any other scene,
has that CharIes Bronson

1037
01:11:32,490 --> 01:11:36,642
-feeI, that streetfighter sense to it.
-Yeah, absoIuteIy.

1038
01:11:36,730 --> 01:11:37,924
WeII, I mean...

1039
01:11:39,170 --> 01:11:41,525
Jason's perfect for a remake of Hard Times.

1040
01:11:49,690 --> 01:11:51,760
That's nice
because that's an unexpected beat.

1041
01:11:51,850 --> 01:11:53,920
I mean, I think you sense
there's gonna be a fight,

1042
01:11:54,010 --> 01:12:00,006
you don't expect the Lists character
to come in and heIp save Jason in that way.

1043
01:12:02,610 --> 01:12:03,679
Wow.

1044
01:12:13,210 --> 01:12:15,360
-You know what?
-That...

1045
01:12:15,450 --> 01:12:17,202
The head in the vise, I Iove that.

1046
01:12:19,530 --> 01:12:21,407
To give away a few fiImmaking secrets,

1047
01:12:21,490 --> 01:12:25,881
I mean, a Iot of this set
is just made out of rubber.

1048
01:12:27,330 --> 01:12:31,482
Those sheIves that just went down
is very, very thin metaI.

1049
01:12:32,890 --> 01:12:36,280
The vise was rubber,
that metaI box is rubber,

1050
01:12:36,370 --> 01:12:39,168
as are aII the metaI pipes inside of it.

1051
01:12:39,250 --> 01:12:42,526
Again, very kind of thin metaIIic sheIves
that he smashed into here.

1052
01:12:43,810 --> 01:12:45,368
The giant spanner that

1053
01:12:45,450 --> 01:12:48,601
-Pachenko hoIds is rubber.
-Yeah, the big wrench.

1054
01:12:48,730 --> 01:12:49,719
And that's not to say...

1055
01:12:49,810 --> 01:12:51,482
I mean, if someone swings at you
with a rubber wrench

1056
01:12:51,570 --> 01:12:53,720
and hits you in the head, it's gonna hurt,

1057
01:12:53,810 --> 01:12:55,926
but it's not gonna send you to hospitaI.

1058
01:12:59,170 --> 01:13:00,569
Ulrich too.

1059
01:13:04,770 --> 01:13:09,844
Again, this is something
that was taken away in the theatricaI cut.

1060
01:13:09,930 --> 01:13:11,682
It's kind of interesting to see it back here,

1061
01:13:11,770 --> 01:13:14,330
but I feIt it was kind of
giIding the IiIy a IittIe bit too much.

1062
01:13:14,410 --> 01:13:17,880
I thought kind of Pachenko's admission
was enough.

1063
01:13:17,970 --> 01:13:21,519
And thus having a fIashback Iike this
took you out of the movie,

1064
01:13:21,610 --> 01:13:25,569
and took you out of the intensity
of Jason wanting to kiII this man.

1065
01:13:27,530 --> 01:13:28,724
But we thought, what the hey,

1066
01:13:28,810 --> 01:13:31,643
you've probabIy seen the movie
aIready in the theatres,

1067
01:13:31,730 --> 01:13:34,688
give you the option to see the stuff
we took out as weII.

1068
01:13:35,650 --> 01:13:38,084
Let's save that for the track, huh?

1069
01:13:43,930 --> 01:13:46,967
Again, one of the few visuaI effects shots
in the movie.

1070
01:13:47,050 --> 01:13:50,042
The isIand didn't exist.
The prison section, though, this is aII reaI.

1071
01:13:50,130 --> 01:13:52,519
So what we did was,
we did a heIicopter shot over the prison

1072
01:13:52,610 --> 01:13:57,081
so you can see the prison courtyard,
the star shape of the prison buiIdings.

1073
01:13:58,370 --> 01:14:00,361
But in the originaI photography,

1074
01:14:00,450 --> 01:14:04,284
aII you see are green fieIds around
and some cows grazing.

1075
01:14:04,370 --> 01:14:06,520
And then, as the visuaI effect,
what we did was

1076
01:14:06,610 --> 01:14:10,080
took away aII the green fieIds,
repIaced it with digitaI water,

1077
01:14:10,170 --> 01:14:12,638
and then the rest of the isIand
as weII is digitaI.

1078
01:14:14,210 --> 01:14:16,121
And those shots...

1079
01:14:16,210 --> 01:14:17,848
I aIways knew those shots
wouId be a chaIIenge

1080
01:14:17,930 --> 01:14:20,080
because so much of the movie is practicaI.

1081
01:14:20,170 --> 01:14:22,923
I think if you're watching a movie
and there's a Iot of CG in it,

1082
01:14:23,010 --> 01:14:26,207
you just get used to it,
you take it for granted

1083
01:14:26,290 --> 01:14:28,679
because it's part of the visuaI Ianguage
of the fiIm.

1084
01:14:28,770 --> 01:14:31,125
If, however, everything is practicaI

1085
01:14:31,210 --> 01:14:34,122
and then suddenIy 30 minutes in,
you see a big CG shot,

1086
01:14:34,210 --> 01:14:36,280
it tends to stick out Iike a sore thumb.

1087
01:14:36,370 --> 01:14:37,883
So those isIand shots

1088
01:14:37,970 --> 01:14:41,406
we reaIIy worked hard to make them
as photo reaI as possibIe.

1089
01:14:41,490 --> 01:14:43,765
So the visuaI effects company, Mr X,

1090
01:14:43,850 --> 01:14:46,728
who's run by a very good friend of ours,
Dennis Berardi,

1091
01:14:46,810 --> 01:14:48,880
they were working on those isIand shots

1092
01:14:48,970 --> 01:14:51,245
even before we started
principIe photography.

1093
01:14:51,330 --> 01:14:55,369
So those are very much the product
of Iike a year's worth of work.

1094
01:14:55,450 --> 01:14:58,567
I just got to comment on those
back puII-ups Jason just did,

1095
01:14:58,650 --> 01:15:02,689
anybody who works out wiII know
they're phenomenaIIy difficuIt and painfuI.

1096
01:15:02,770 --> 01:15:06,479
And he reaIIy did that, and PauI
must have done seven or eight takes.

1097
01:15:06,570 --> 01:15:08,481
-Yes.
-So he probabIy did 80, 90

1098
01:15:08,570 --> 01:15:11,038
-back puII-ups in that one session.
-Yeah.

1099
01:15:11,130 --> 01:15:12,279
AII for reaI.

1100
01:15:16,010 --> 01:15:18,319
Yeah, I mean, Jason
was so discipIined during this fiIm.

1101
01:15:18,410 --> 01:15:22,039
I mean, it's very much his movie.
He's in virtuaIIy every scene.

1102
01:15:22,130 --> 01:15:25,361
So, he wouId be on set every singIe day.

1103
01:15:25,450 --> 01:15:27,361
You know, when you are an actor,

1104
01:15:27,450 --> 01:15:30,044
the crew caII
is usuaIIy Iike 7.:00 in the morning,

1105
01:15:30,130 --> 01:15:33,042
but the actors have to be there
at 5.:30 or 6.:00,

1106
01:15:33,130 --> 01:15:35,280
so they can go into makeup beforehand.

1107
01:15:35,370 --> 01:15:38,043
But with him, he'd want to work out
for an hour.

1108
01:15:38,130 --> 01:15:40,200
So he wasn't turning up at the set at 5.:30,

1109
01:15:40,290 --> 01:15:45,205
he was turning up at the gym at 4.:30
or even 4.:00.

1110
01:15:45,290 --> 01:15:48,839
So the guy worked phenomenaIIy hard.

1111
01:15:48,930 --> 01:15:53,526
Very discipIined, very discipIined in what
he ate as weII, so he couId stay in shape.

1112
01:15:53,610 --> 01:15:55,487
And towards the end of the movie,

1113
01:15:55,570 --> 01:15:59,722
he came up to me and said, ''PauI,
I just can't wait to eat cake and drink beer. ''

1114
01:16:03,170 --> 01:16:06,560
-And I'm sure he has done that since then.
-He earned it.

1115
01:16:07,970 --> 01:16:09,926
AIso, the tattoos that you see on Jason,

1116
01:16:10,010 --> 01:16:15,767
we were very carefuI in our research
to get reaI prison tattoos.

1117
01:16:15,850 --> 01:16:20,366
And Jason reaIIy paid attention to that.
And that took a Iot of time to put them on.

1118
01:16:20,450 --> 01:16:23,044
Yeah, every time you see him
with his top off,

1119
01:16:23,130 --> 01:16:25,439
aII those tattoos are reaIIy the product of

1120
01:16:25,530 --> 01:16:27,839
two-and-a haIf, three hours
in the makeup chair.

1121
01:16:27,970 --> 01:16:30,279
Did you kill the old Frank?

1122
01:16:30,370 --> 01:16:31,564
What?

1123
01:16:31,650 --> 01:16:33,322
Tunnel comes up fast.

1124
01:16:34,010 --> 01:16:36,968
Remember what happened
to the napalm canister?

1125
01:16:40,090 --> 01:16:42,968
This is where she remembers
what happened to the napaIm.

1126
01:16:46,810 --> 01:16:48,482
ActuaIIy, these interior spaces are

1127
01:16:48,570 --> 01:16:51,289
a reaI bIessing
to an action fiIm maker as weII,

1128
01:16:51,370 --> 01:16:54,089
because when you shoot
a car chase sequence,

1129
01:16:54,170 --> 01:16:58,288
one of the hard things that you're trying
to convey is the sense of speed.

1130
01:16:58,370 --> 01:17:02,682
And if you're in the outdoors,
and you have no terms of reference,

1131
01:17:02,770 --> 01:17:04,886
it's hard to convey speed.

1132
01:17:04,970 --> 01:17:06,483
It's Iike when you're driving in the desert,

1133
01:17:06,570 --> 01:17:10,483
if you don't have buiIdings
rushing past you,

1134
01:17:10,570 --> 01:17:14,449
you're just out in the desert, you couId
easiIy be driving at 90, 100 miIes an hour,

1135
01:17:14,530 --> 01:17:17,886
and not reaIise it.
You know, you think you're doing 50 or 60.

1136
01:17:17,970 --> 01:17:20,404
What was great
about aII of these interior spaces,

1137
01:17:20,490 --> 01:17:22,003
and some of the exterior spaces as weII,

1138
01:17:22,090 --> 01:17:27,767
was aII the uprights,
aII the steeI girders that I couId have the...

1139
01:17:28,610 --> 01:17:30,965
The action vehicIe on one side
of the steeI girders

1140
01:17:31,050 --> 01:17:32,768
and the tracking vehicIe on another,

1141
01:17:32,850 --> 01:17:36,240
so that the foreground
has the steeI girders going past,

1142
01:17:36,330 --> 01:17:39,367
and they did a Iot
to enhance the sense of speed.

1143
01:17:45,210 --> 01:17:46,962
Yeah, I mean...

1144
01:17:47,050 --> 01:17:49,484
But I can't praise our stunt team enough.

1145
01:17:49,570 --> 01:17:53,199
Jack GiII,
Andy GiII who is the stunt coordinator,

1146
01:17:53,290 --> 01:17:55,246
very brave guys.

1147
01:17:55,330 --> 01:17:59,289
Yeah, and Jack GiII, who was driving
the hero car most of the time.

1148
01:18:01,370 --> 01:18:04,248
I mean, in a way,
this movie is a throwback to the 1970s,

1149
01:18:04,330 --> 01:18:08,721
and movies that we Ioved,
Iike Bullitt and The French Connection.

1150
01:18:08,810 --> 01:18:11,244
You know, movies from the '80s
Iike WaIter HiIIs' The Driver.

1151
01:18:11,330 --> 01:18:13,844
You know, back in those days
when there was no CG,

1152
01:18:13,930 --> 01:18:16,000
if you wanted
a spectacuIar action sequence,

1153
01:18:16,090 --> 01:18:19,082
it was up to a stunt man
strapping himseIf into a car

1154
01:18:19,170 --> 01:18:21,525
and doing something
spectacuIarIy dangerous,

1155
01:18:21,610 --> 01:18:25,080
and that's what we asked of these guys
and they reaIIy, reaIIy deIivered.

1156
01:18:29,290 --> 01:18:33,044
You know, we wouId have...
For exampIe we buiIt five Mustangs

1157
01:18:33,130 --> 01:18:36,759
and reguIarIy, at the end of a shooting day,
four of the Mustangs,

1158
01:18:36,850 --> 01:18:38,647
and sometimes aII five of them,

1159
01:18:38,730 --> 01:18:41,403
wouId be in the auto shop
being worked on aII night,

1160
01:18:41,490 --> 01:18:44,926
because we wouId have destroyed
or haIf-destroyed five cars.

1161
01:18:47,530 --> 01:18:49,646
Yeah, something Iike that,

1162
01:18:49,730 --> 01:18:52,802
where you just sIam a car into metaI girders.

1163
01:18:52,890 --> 01:18:55,358
You know, it's very unpredictabIe,
you can burst tyres

1164
01:18:55,450 --> 01:18:57,281
the cars can go out of controI.

1165
01:18:58,450 --> 01:19:00,361
There was actuaIIy a Iot of
spectacuIar stuff that happened

1166
01:19:00,450 --> 01:19:01,599
that never made it into the movie,

1167
01:19:01,690 --> 01:19:04,443
because continuity-wise,
it didn't make sense.

1168
01:19:04,530 --> 01:19:06,202
But quite often,
we'd be shooting a stunt Iike that

1169
01:19:06,290 --> 01:19:10,078
and the Mustang wouId just spin
out of controI and smash into something.

1170
01:19:10,170 --> 01:19:13,401
So there was a Iot of spectacuIar stuff
Ieft on the cutting room fIoor.

1171
01:19:18,130 --> 01:19:21,202
Again, this is aII reaI machine gun fire.

1172
01:19:21,290 --> 01:19:24,362
We went through
a phenomenaI amount of ammunition.

1173
01:19:25,970 --> 01:19:27,722
I think the good foIks in MontreaI

1174
01:19:27,810 --> 01:19:29,880
thought the Third WorId War
had broken out a Iot of times

1175
01:19:29,970 --> 01:19:32,848
when we started
shooting these battIe scenes.

1176
01:19:35,410 --> 01:19:37,446
He's too heavily armoured!

1177
01:19:37,610 --> 01:19:40,682
If anyone's interested to go back
and Iook at our first movie,

1178
01:19:40,770 --> 01:19:44,922
distributed by Roger Corman,
it's caIIed Shopping, avaiIabIe on DVD.

1179
01:19:45,010 --> 01:19:49,640
You'II see this same action sequence,
but done very, very cheapIy.

1180
01:19:49,730 --> 01:19:52,722
We did it with a van fuII of poIicemen

1181
01:19:52,810 --> 01:19:56,803
and an oId BMW,
and we shot it in about three hours.

1182
01:19:57,850 --> 01:19:59,886
It's nowhere near
as spectacuIar as this, obviousIy,

1183
01:19:59,970 --> 01:20:03,963
but it's kind of the beginnings
of the thought process that Ied up to...

1184
01:20:05,050 --> 01:20:07,006
-That sequence.
-Yeah, to this sequence.

1185
01:20:07,090 --> 01:20:08,967
There's aIso a simiIar scene

1186
01:20:09,050 --> 01:20:13,282
where we had NataIie standing up in the car
and throwing the cigarette Iighter out

1187
01:20:13,370 --> 01:20:16,726
that ignited the napaIm
in the race before this.

1188
01:20:16,810 --> 01:20:19,370
We did a simiIar kind of thing,
where Sadie Frost

1189
01:20:19,450 --> 01:20:20,849
stood up in the back of the BMW

1190
01:20:20,930 --> 01:20:24,923
and started throwing cassette tapes
at some pursuing poIice cars.

1191
01:20:25,010 --> 01:20:27,729
You know, kind of simiIar framing,
simiIar ideas,

1192
01:20:27,810 --> 01:20:30,882
but executed with a Iot more vigour
in this movie.

1193
01:20:32,530 --> 01:20:35,681
I Iove the sound effects in this scene
when his hands are crunching on that gIass.

1194
01:20:35,770 --> 01:20:37,283
Yeah.

1195
01:20:37,370 --> 01:20:40,203
If you Iook cIoseIy though,
you can see it's aII pIastic and rubber.

1196
01:20:42,890 --> 01:20:46,166
Very tough MontreaI stunt guy there.

1197
01:20:46,250 --> 01:20:49,845
I was in discussion
with our stunt coordinator, Andy GiII,

1198
01:20:49,930 --> 01:20:51,761
about how to achieve that.

1199
01:20:51,850 --> 01:20:56,844
You know, to be abIe to hit a man
with a car door, with a speeding car door.

1200
01:20:56,930 --> 01:20:59,398
'Cause I was imagining
we'd have to have some rigs,

1201
01:20:59,490 --> 01:21:01,720
maybe we'd have to do some visuaI effect.

1202
01:21:01,810 --> 01:21:05,166
And he said, ''No, PauI, it's quite simpIe.
We'II just hit someone with a car door. ''

1203
01:21:05,250 --> 01:21:06,922
And that's what he did.

1204
01:21:08,290 --> 01:21:10,440
We did pad the car door with rubber,

1205
01:21:10,530 --> 01:21:12,998
just to make it a IittIe Iess impactfuI.

1206
01:21:13,090 --> 01:21:16,127
But basicaIIy that's just a man
getting sIammed

1207
01:21:16,210 --> 01:21:18,849
by a car door
and spinning through the air as a resuIt.

1208
01:21:20,490 --> 01:21:22,446
He had to do it about five or six times.

1209
01:21:24,370 --> 01:21:26,201
Okay. l see him. l need guns.

1210
01:21:26,290 --> 01:21:28,679
Yes. Sword coming up in 50 yards.

1211
01:21:32,530 --> 01:21:33,849
-What happened?
-l don't know.

1212
01:21:33,930 --> 01:21:35,409
Somebody must have grabbed it.

1213
01:21:36,010 --> 01:21:37,762
Roger Corman's movie
was a very funny movie.

1214
01:21:37,850 --> 01:21:40,808
I mean, it was a very overt satire,

1215
01:21:40,890 --> 01:21:42,164
which we're not, obviousIy,

1216
01:21:42,250 --> 01:21:45,447
but we wanted to maintain
as much humour as possibIe.

1217
01:21:46,530 --> 01:21:50,079
'Cause aIthough this can be quite
a brutaI fiIm, it's aIso a fun fiIm.

1218
01:21:50,170 --> 01:21:52,604
-And that was particuIarIy fun.
-Yes.

1219
01:22:01,450 --> 01:22:04,886
And the way that was achieved was,
that was a dummy

1220
01:22:04,970 --> 01:22:09,566
that was kicked out of the car
and hit the metaI post,

1221
01:22:09,650 --> 01:22:12,642
and then it had
a smaII amount of CG enhancement.

1222
01:22:12,730 --> 01:22:15,449
The spray of bIood,
a IittIe bit of movement on the face.

1223
01:22:16,770 --> 01:22:20,206
What's great is, immediateIy, the new
navigator does not want to be in the car.

1224
01:22:20,290 --> 01:22:22,520
He'd rather be anywhere eIse
than in that car.

1225
01:22:22,610 --> 01:22:24,805
Yeah, that usuaIIy gets a very good Iaugh.

1226
01:22:29,130 --> 01:22:31,041
Release the Dreadnought.

1227
01:22:35,970 --> 01:22:38,200
And here she is, the Dreadnought.

1228
01:22:40,530 --> 01:22:41,804
Coach?

1229
01:22:42,290 --> 01:22:46,329
A big inspiration for this
was cIearIy The Road Warrior,

1230
01:22:46,410 --> 01:22:49,322
and the finaI scene
where you have the oiI tanker.

1231
01:22:49,410 --> 01:22:52,163
And we wanted to take that to the next IeveI.

1232
01:22:52,250 --> 01:22:54,002
And The Road Warrior
was a big infIuence for us,

1233
01:22:54,090 --> 01:22:56,320
but I think that's onIy fair because

1234
01:22:56,410 --> 01:22:58,765
George MiIIer,
who directed The Road Warrior,

1235
01:22:58,850 --> 01:23:02,525
has frequentIy admitted that Death Race
was a big infIuence for him.

1236
01:23:02,610 --> 01:23:05,124
So in many ways,
everything's come fuII circIe.

1237
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:08,729
-Everything goes back to Roger Corman.
-It does.

1238
01:23:12,930 --> 01:23:15,398
So Dreadnought,
what does that actuaIIy mean, PauI?

1239
01:23:17,330 --> 01:23:22,120
Dreadnought was originaIIy a term
for an ironcIad warship.

1240
01:23:23,930 --> 01:23:26,524
Back in days when aII warships
were made of wood,

1241
01:23:26,610 --> 01:23:30,080
when they started having ironcIads,
they were caIIed Dreadnoughts,

1242
01:23:30,170 --> 01:23:33,606
because they were
assumed to be indestructibIe.

1243
01:23:33,690 --> 01:23:37,285
And that was the kind of feeIing
that I wanted for this.

1244
01:23:37,370 --> 01:23:41,329
It's kind of Iike a huge, big warship
but moves on the Iand.

1245
01:23:41,410 --> 01:23:44,163
We aIso just, again,
wanted this section of the race

1246
01:23:44,250 --> 01:23:47,287
to have something new and unexpected.

1247
01:23:47,370 --> 01:23:51,363
And it underIines
the extent of Joan AIIen's viIIainy.

1248
01:23:51,450 --> 01:23:56,001
I mean, this is not a race
with fair ruIes at aII.

1249
01:23:58,130 --> 01:24:01,122
No, it's a race that's manipuIated for ratings.

1250
01:24:02,690 --> 01:24:04,487
You sure about that?

1251
01:24:05,890 --> 01:24:09,166
Which is why seeing
Machine Gun Joe and Jensen

1252
01:24:09,250 --> 01:24:13,528
outsmart her is fantastic.

1253
01:24:19,090 --> 01:24:22,048
I reaIIy Iike her grey suits,
it's very HiIIary CIinton.

1254
01:24:22,890 --> 01:24:24,482
Where the hell is that thing going?

1255
01:24:43,050 --> 01:24:45,359
This is so bad, what we're about to do, PauI.

1256
01:24:46,410 --> 01:24:49,800
This is Iike Ben-Hur,
this is uber Ben-Hur. The wheeIs...

1257
01:24:49,890 --> 01:24:51,369
Yeah, weII this is...

1258
01:24:51,450 --> 01:24:54,089
You know,
that was another big infIuence to us,

1259
01:24:55,010 --> 01:24:58,161
was Ben-Hur, and the whoIe idea
of the Circus Maximus as weII.

1260
01:24:58,250 --> 01:25:02,482
You know, the Circus Maximus
was the CoIosseum, but a bit Iarge,

1261
01:25:02,570 --> 01:25:05,721
where they wouId have
aII the chariot races in ancient Rome.

1262
01:25:05,810 --> 01:25:08,085
And there's a great scene in Ben-Hur
where they have these

1263
01:25:08,170 --> 01:25:11,879
spikes on the wheeIs of the chariots,
and that was a big infIuence for this.

1264
01:25:17,730 --> 01:25:19,960
Again, there's no modeI work there,
that shot you saw

1265
01:25:20,050 --> 01:25:22,041
of the Porsche being dragged
behind the Dreadnought,

1266
01:25:22,130 --> 01:25:24,598
that's aII done fuII scaIe, for reaI.

1267
01:25:27,370 --> 01:25:28,689
Fuck me.

1268
01:25:29,450 --> 01:25:32,487
This reminds me of what we did
to CoIin SaImon in the gIass corridor

1269
01:25:32,570 --> 01:25:35,164
-in Resident Evil l, that moment...
-Yes.

1270
01:25:35,250 --> 01:25:39,402
...when he goes, ''Shit, ''
just before he gets diced.

1271
01:25:42,410 --> 01:25:43,684
Lists.

1272
01:25:44,410 --> 01:25:45,399
Receiving.

1273
01:25:45,490 --> 01:25:47,526
l want you to patch me through
to another car.

1274
01:25:47,610 --> 01:25:48,759
On it.

1275
01:25:50,930 --> 01:25:56,129
We reaIIy tried to kind of keep
the stuff in the pits as kinetic as possibIe,

1276
01:25:56,210 --> 01:25:58,360
in the way that we shot them.

1277
01:25:58,450 --> 01:26:01,169
So that the interior of the car,
and the action sequences,

1278
01:26:01,250 --> 01:26:03,684
and the pits wouId
kind of seamIessIy fit together.

1279
01:26:03,770 --> 01:26:07,763
So even when we're shooting in the pits,
we have handheId camera.

1280
01:26:07,850 --> 01:26:10,045
Quite often it's got a very skinny shutter,

1281
01:26:12,330 --> 01:26:15,766
even though it's just diaIogue, we're trying
to keep it as exciting as possibIe.

1282
01:26:38,250 --> 01:26:41,799
And this stunt coming up
is truIy spectacuIar.

1283
01:26:41,890 --> 01:26:43,562
We onIy buiIt one Dreadnought,

1284
01:26:43,650 --> 01:26:47,609
so this was very much a one-shot deaI.

1285
01:26:47,690 --> 01:26:49,885
You know, we couId onIy shoot it the once.

1286
01:26:49,970 --> 01:26:53,326
And thank goodness
it turned out to be as spectacuIar as it was.

1287
01:26:53,410 --> 01:26:55,128
Now, this whoIe thing is for reaI.

1288
01:26:57,290 --> 01:27:01,568
WeII, it's aII for reaI,
apart from the IittIe men fIying off the top.

1289
01:27:01,650 --> 01:27:04,722
They're a digitaI effect, for obvious reasons.

1290
01:27:04,810 --> 01:27:06,926
Now that you can see this on DVD,

1291
01:27:07,010 --> 01:27:09,763
I recommend going back
and pausing on that shot

1292
01:27:09,850 --> 01:27:11,761
where the Dreadnought hits the ground,

1293
01:27:11,850 --> 01:27:13,966
and that guy in the tank turret
gets squished.

1294
01:27:14,050 --> 01:27:15,529
'Cause you can see a big spray of bIood

1295
01:27:15,610 --> 01:27:18,283
going straight up
from the underside of the turret.

1296
01:27:18,370 --> 01:27:23,205
We had Iots of discussions about that stunt,
whether we shouId buiId a miniature,

1297
01:27:23,290 --> 01:27:27,283
we actuaIIy thought of doing it fuIIy CG,
but I'm so gIad we did it for reaI.

1298
01:27:27,370 --> 01:27:28,564
Damn it!

1299
01:27:29,890 --> 01:27:32,768
Yeah, there's so much detaiI in that shot

1300
01:27:32,850 --> 01:27:37,799
that it wouId have been very hard
to create that as a visuaI effect.

1301
01:27:37,890 --> 01:27:40,279
-SpeciaIIy in dayIight.
-Yeah, in broad dayIight

1302
01:27:40,370 --> 01:27:43,965
where, you know,
the CG tends not to hoId up so weII.

1303
01:27:44,050 --> 01:27:45,278
Is this one of these scenes, PauI,

1304
01:27:45,370 --> 01:27:48,726
which you'd say sort of echoes Rollerball?
When he's waIking down there.

1305
01:27:48,810 --> 01:27:51,324
The, ''Jonathan! Jonathan!''

1306
01:27:51,410 --> 01:27:53,685
-Yeah, the originaI Rollerball.
-''Frankenstein! Frankenstein!''

1307
01:27:53,770 --> 01:27:57,558
WeII, I might say that the originaI Rollerball
perhaps echoed the originaI Death Race.

1308
01:27:57,650 --> 01:28:00,448
-You might be right.
-It's a scene, I mean,

1309
01:28:00,530 --> 01:28:03,647
that chanting of Frankenstein
is taken from the originaI movie.

1310
01:28:06,730 --> 01:28:08,448
You look lost, pal.

1311
01:28:08,930 --> 01:28:10,488
Not this time.

1312
01:28:12,050 --> 01:28:15,326
l got this feeling
that you and Frank are close.

1313
01:28:16,650 --> 01:28:18,208
Real close.

1314
01:28:18,290 --> 01:28:21,680
That weird accent.
You even kind of sound alike.

1315
01:28:23,850 --> 01:28:26,887
AII the costumes here
are aII prison issue gear.

1316
01:28:28,170 --> 01:28:30,320
In terms of the money we spent
on the costumes for this movie,

1317
01:28:30,410 --> 01:28:32,480
it's probabIy the cheapest aspect of the fiIm.

1318
01:28:32,570 --> 01:28:34,640
Cheapest costume budget
of any movie we've made

1319
01:28:34,730 --> 01:28:38,962
because we just ordered it aII
from a prison suppIier.

1320
01:28:39,050 --> 01:28:43,441
And, of course, as you can imagine,
prison wear is not that expensive.

1321
01:28:43,530 --> 01:28:46,283
And aIso the race gear
that aII of the drivers wear,

1322
01:28:46,370 --> 01:28:48,930
aIthough they are aIIowed to,
kind of, wear different stuff

1323
01:28:49,010 --> 01:28:50,489
for the race, the day of the race,

1324
01:28:50,570 --> 01:28:54,165
they don't have to wear
standard prison issue stuff,

1325
01:28:54,250 --> 01:28:57,208
we said to our costume designer,
Gregory Mah,

1326
01:28:57,290 --> 01:29:01,522
you have to make these costumes,
the race costumes, from prison wear

1327
01:29:01,610 --> 01:29:03,487
'cause that's aII
they're gonna be given access to.

1328
01:29:03,570 --> 01:29:05,925
So they can dye it, they can cut it up.

1329
01:29:06,010 --> 01:29:08,649
They can sew bits and pieces together,

1330
01:29:08,730 --> 01:29:12,359
but everything has to be made from
something that's standard prison issue.

1331
01:29:13,530 --> 01:29:16,727
And I think that adds
to the beIievabiIity of it aII as weII.

1332
01:29:19,050 --> 01:29:22,167
-You want me to kill Frankenstein?
-Don't be stupid.

1333
01:29:22,250 --> 01:29:24,400
Frankenstein can't die.

1334
01:29:24,490 --> 01:29:26,560
After all, he's just a mask.

1335
01:29:39,090 --> 01:29:43,163
This is a sequence that I caII
PauI's commerciaI for buiIding a bomb.

1336
01:29:44,250 --> 01:29:46,480
-The instructionaI video.
-Yeah.

1337
01:29:47,610 --> 01:29:50,170
I couIdn't beIieve how Iong
we were spending on shooting this,

1338
01:29:50,250 --> 01:29:52,161
I mean, I now see why.

1339
01:29:52,250 --> 01:29:54,605
It stiII feeIs a bit Iike a commerciaI.

1340
01:29:54,690 --> 01:29:56,567
This is the Caesar moment.

1341
01:29:57,450 --> 01:30:00,442
Joan AIIen addressing her inmates.

1342
01:30:02,130 --> 01:30:05,839
I mean, it's very much a Roman-Greek

1343
01:30:05,930 --> 01:30:07,921
gIadiator feeI to this fiIm.

1344
01:30:08,010 --> 01:30:11,241
-WeII, she is kind of Iike the eviI Caesar.
-Yeah.

1345
01:30:11,330 --> 01:30:15,482
Of course, I mean, the whoIe idea
of prisoners fighting for their freedom

1346
01:30:15,570 --> 01:30:18,448
does go back to Roman times,
and goes back to the gIadiators.

1347
01:30:19,450 --> 01:30:23,284
...and were too dangerous to live
with the rest of us.

1348
01:30:24,050 --> 01:30:25,039
What is this shit, man?

1349
01:30:25,130 --> 01:30:28,440
And the idea aIso
of a society that's in coIIapse

1350
01:30:28,530 --> 01:30:31,567
focusing upon
these kind of bIoody confrontations.

1351
01:30:31,650 --> 01:30:34,164
In our version,
everyone's watching it on the Internet

1352
01:30:34,250 --> 01:30:36,161
whiIe the American economy coIIapses.

1353
01:30:36,250 --> 01:30:39,799
In Rome,
everyone was going to the Circus Maximus,

1354
01:30:39,890 --> 01:30:43,565
which wouId hoId a third of the popuIation
of Rome at any one time.

1355
01:30:43,650 --> 01:30:46,118
So IiteraIIy, a third of the popuIation
couId be in the Circus Maximus

1356
01:30:46,210 --> 01:30:50,761
watching chariot races
whiIe the Roman economy coIIapsed.

1357
01:30:50,850 --> 01:30:53,205
And the empire decIined and feII.

1358
01:30:53,290 --> 01:30:56,566
And the peopIe in the races were sIaves

1359
01:30:58,010 --> 01:31:00,729
or prisoners, 'cause it's okay
to see them kiII each other.

1360
01:31:01,930 --> 01:31:03,283
Same idea here.

1361
01:31:05,290 --> 01:31:08,919
And it draws inspiration from your courage.

1362
01:31:09,730 --> 01:31:11,607
No one is ever gonna win five races.

1363
01:31:11,690 --> 01:31:13,840
So race well...

1364
01:31:13,930 --> 01:31:15,602
Nobody is ever getting out of here.

1365
01:31:15,690 --> 01:31:18,648
This was a tough day, PauI.
You remember aII that rain?

1366
01:31:18,730 --> 01:31:22,689
Yeah, aII these cIose-ups
on Statham and McShane,

1367
01:31:22,770 --> 01:31:25,125
they are very intense
but aIso very necessary.

1368
01:31:25,210 --> 01:31:29,965
It was raining so hard we had to erect
Iike a big tent over the top of them.

1369
01:31:31,290 --> 01:31:33,201
But the whoIe pIace was fIooding,

1370
01:31:34,090 --> 01:31:37,162
Jason was wearing rubber boots,

1371
01:31:37,250 --> 01:31:40,322
'cause he was standing
in a huge Iake of water.

1372
01:31:40,410 --> 01:31:42,287
It was a very, very tough day.

1373
01:31:42,410 --> 01:31:44,128
You can burn me.

1374
01:31:44,690 --> 01:31:47,762
You can shoot me.
But you can't motherfucking...

1375
01:31:47,850 --> 01:31:48,999
There.

1376
01:31:59,090 --> 01:32:02,878
Nice bit of set dressing, PauI, the IittIe
dancing girI on the top of the monitor.

1377
01:32:02,970 --> 01:32:05,962
WeII, I put that there
because I thought it was important,

1378
01:32:06,050 --> 01:32:09,725
when you come back
and you see the frozen screen a IittIe Iater,

1379
01:32:09,810 --> 01:32:11,687
so you see what they were Iooking at.

1380
01:32:11,770 --> 01:32:14,967
So you understand where the idea of
escaping through that biIIboard came from.

1381
01:32:15,050 --> 01:32:18,281
That you kind of recognise...
You immediateIy recaII this moment.

1382
01:32:18,370 --> 01:32:22,124
So I thought the more distinct I can make
that video recorder and teIevision,

1383
01:32:22,210 --> 01:32:23,689
the better. So that's where aII those things...

1384
01:32:23,770 --> 01:32:26,045
That was right before we shot it,
I just grabbed a bunch of stuff

1385
01:32:26,130 --> 01:32:28,690
from the prop department,
and stuck them on that.

1386
01:32:31,930 --> 01:32:33,966
Oh, this is not good.

1387
01:32:36,370 --> 01:32:37,883
As much as possibIe,
aII of these prison guards

1388
01:32:37,970 --> 01:32:40,962
that you see standing around
were actuaI reaI prison guards.

1389
01:32:41,050 --> 01:32:45,248
So they wouId have the reaI kind of attitude
and swagger of the reaI peopIe

1390
01:32:45,330 --> 01:32:47,924
and add to the reaIity of the situation.

1391
01:32:48,010 --> 01:32:50,444
And it aIso gave the actors
someone to taIk to, as weII, you know.

1392
01:32:50,530 --> 01:32:53,840
The more they couId be immersed in
the reaIity of being in a prison environment,

1393
01:32:53,930 --> 01:32:57,479
the more peopIe they couId taIk to,
who reaIIy worked in prisons, the better.

1394
01:33:00,690 --> 01:33:02,999
l've already won three races.

1395
01:33:06,290 --> 01:33:08,850
I Iove that word TerminaI.
I just think it's so graphic.

1396
01:33:08,930 --> 01:33:11,444
I Iove it on the back of aII of the jackets.

1397
01:33:11,530 --> 01:33:14,488
And TerminaI IsIand was actuaIIy inspired
by the reaI TerminaI IsIand,

1398
01:33:14,570 --> 01:33:18,802
which is off the coast of CaIifornia,
it's off Long Beach Harbour.

1399
01:33:18,890 --> 01:33:22,280
And it actuaIIy, TerminaI IsIand
actuaIIy has a prison on it and

1400
01:33:22,370 --> 01:33:25,646
it used to be aIso a NavaI Air Force base.

1401
01:33:25,730 --> 01:33:27,288
And when that was decommissioned,

1402
01:33:27,370 --> 01:33:30,919
they used to do drag races
on the abandoned runway.

1403
01:33:31,010 --> 01:33:36,528
And that was where I reaIIy got the idea of
a prison and a racetrack on an isIand from.

1404
01:33:39,970 --> 01:33:41,039
Hey.

1405
01:33:43,690 --> 01:33:46,682
Thinking you and Frank
should have a little talk.

1406
01:33:50,890 --> 01:33:53,848
It's very... AImost Iike Turner, that shot.

1407
01:33:53,930 --> 01:33:54,919
Like an oiI painting.

1408
01:33:55,010 --> 01:33:56,443
Seven men dead.

1409
01:33:56,530 --> 01:33:57,519
Siad...

1410
01:33:57,610 --> 01:34:01,319
WeII, I think, you know, what I Iike about
kind of big industriaI decay Iike this,

1411
01:34:01,410 --> 01:34:04,322
is it does have a beauty to it.

1412
01:34:04,410 --> 01:34:06,241
At Ieast I think so.

1413
01:34:06,330 --> 01:34:08,480
But then, you did grow up
in the northeast of EngIand.

1414
01:34:08,570 --> 01:34:09,559
Yeah.

1415
01:34:09,650 --> 01:34:12,847
If you didn't find beauty in industriaI decay,
there'd be no beauty.

1416
01:34:13,770 --> 01:34:14,964
Good point.

1417
01:34:16,050 --> 01:34:19,281
lt's mano y mano,
and there will be no mercy.

1418
01:34:21,090 --> 01:34:24,366
Here I Iove these roadways, 'cause again
there's no CG set extensions.

1419
01:34:24,450 --> 01:34:29,160
It's aII just, we found a big Iocation
and we shot it for reaI.

1420
01:34:32,530 --> 01:34:35,727
You know, this Iong roadway
was reaIIy something we created.

1421
01:34:35,810 --> 01:34:38,483
When Jeremy and I
scouted this Iocation to start with,

1422
01:34:38,570 --> 01:34:42,882
this was just a gap between
two of the big train buiIdings.

1423
01:34:42,970 --> 01:34:46,201
And there was a IittIe bit of a roadway

1424
01:34:46,290 --> 01:34:49,600
but then there were aIso
a Iot of smaII metaI huts.

1425
01:34:49,690 --> 01:34:51,089
There was a Iot of grass.

1426
01:34:51,170 --> 01:34:53,764
There was some big heaps
of kind of earth and everything.

1427
01:34:53,850 --> 01:34:56,648
So we kind of had it aII fIattened.
We had aII the huts knocked down.

1428
01:34:56,730 --> 01:34:58,448
We had the earth fIattened out.

1429
01:34:58,530 --> 01:35:02,569
We put a Iot of graveI and Iot of bIacktop
down to create our roadway.

1430
01:35:09,370 --> 01:35:10,883
There were definiteIy times
whiIe making this movie

1431
01:35:10,970 --> 01:35:14,201
that I feIt more Iike an industriaI engineer
than a fiIm director.

1432
01:35:14,290 --> 01:35:18,522
Because in between having to create
aII the roadways and create aII the cars,

1433
01:35:18,610 --> 01:35:21,488
and everything be for reaI,
we aIso had to buiId a Iot of the rigs

1434
01:35:21,570 --> 01:35:24,960
that wouId kind of spin and twist the cars
in the way we wanted them,

1435
01:35:25,050 --> 01:35:27,518
to make sure they wouId spin
through the air in the right way.

1436
01:35:27,610 --> 01:35:32,843
So I spent a Iot of time taIking about
weight ratios and Ioad-bearing structures.

1437
01:35:35,410 --> 01:35:37,321
But if you do win,

1438
01:35:37,410 --> 01:35:40,049
l want you to think about staying here.

1439
01:35:40,690 --> 01:35:42,282
As Frankenstein.

1440
01:35:43,250 --> 01:35:44,478
With me.

1441
01:35:44,570 --> 01:35:47,403
It's a great scene, this, I mean,
she actuaIIy beIieves that he might consider

1442
01:35:47,490 --> 01:35:50,402
what she is proposing,
to stay with him, to stay with her.

1443
01:35:50,490 --> 01:35:51,889
-Pretty eviI.
-Yeah.

1444
01:35:55,890 --> 01:35:58,040
She's kind of Iike Lady Macbeth, aImost.

1445
01:35:58,130 --> 01:35:59,563
The thing is,

1446
01:35:59,650 --> 01:36:02,562
are you really the best future
she could possibly have?

1447
01:36:04,490 --> 01:36:08,642
Are you really daddy material?
Or deep down, are you something else?

1448
01:36:14,330 --> 01:36:18,243
lf you decided that out there
on that track is where you belong,

1449
01:36:18,330 --> 01:36:22,243
it would be the most unselfish act of love
l've ever seen.

1450
01:36:22,330 --> 01:36:24,002
There's aImost a sIight
erotic tension between them.

1451
01:36:24,090 --> 01:36:27,207
I mean, was that something you even
thought about particuIarIy before?

1452
01:36:27,290 --> 01:36:31,522
Yeah, definiteIy.
I mean, if you make a prison movie,

1453
01:36:31,610 --> 01:36:33,680
I think it's aIways charged
with that sexuaI tension,

1454
01:36:33,770 --> 01:36:35,647
especiaIIy when you put a woman
in that environment.

1455
01:36:35,730 --> 01:36:37,209
-Right.
-And then, aIso, you know,

1456
01:36:37,290 --> 01:36:40,805
there's the whoIe undercurrent
of kind of homo-eroticism, as weII,

1457
01:36:40,890 --> 01:36:43,120
-that kind of comes with prison movies.
-Yeah.

1458
01:36:45,610 --> 01:36:47,646
There's definiteIy eroticism around NataIie.

1459
01:36:48,930 --> 01:36:51,490
WeII, that's not typicaI
of prison fiIms, I guess.

1460
01:36:52,610 --> 01:36:55,602
UnIess it's Caged Heat.
Another Roger Corman cIassic.

1461
01:36:55,690 --> 01:36:57,760
Perhaps we shouId consider remaking that.

1462
01:37:09,210 --> 01:37:10,689
What's this?

1463
01:37:10,770 --> 01:37:12,442
Small modification.

1464
01:37:13,610 --> 01:37:17,603
So Hennessey tells me if you're going
to win, l'm supposed to stop you.

1465
01:37:17,690 --> 01:37:19,328
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

1466
01:37:21,170 --> 01:37:23,843
Sounds like the odds
are stacked against us.

1467
01:37:23,930 --> 01:37:25,886
Then do what you do best.

1468
01:37:28,010 --> 01:37:29,238
Drive.

1469
01:37:39,890 --> 01:37:43,041
Gentlemen, this should be interesting.

1470
01:37:45,250 --> 01:37:47,844
It's nice editing from Niven Howie here,

1471
01:37:47,930 --> 01:37:52,446
who has cut a coupIe of fiIms for us.
RecentIy, Resident Evil 3.

1472
01:37:54,090 --> 01:37:55,842
Yeah, we did
Resident Evil: Extinction together,

1473
01:37:55,930 --> 01:37:58,239
and then Niven came straight on to this.

1474
01:38:03,850 --> 01:38:07,559
I think on average,
and this is not to boast but just on average,

1475
01:38:07,650 --> 01:38:10,403
I think there is an edit
every second in this fiIm.

1476
01:38:12,170 --> 01:38:13,728
That does sound quite boastfuI, though.

1477
01:38:13,810 --> 01:38:16,688
It's not, Iisten, I didn't cut it,
Niven, it's aII down to him.

1478
01:38:16,810 --> 01:38:17,799
Damn it!

1479
01:38:28,010 --> 01:38:29,125
Shit.

1480
01:38:30,810 --> 01:38:32,368
Lit shield up ahead!

1481
01:38:36,330 --> 01:38:37,319
Damn it!

1482
01:38:37,410 --> 01:38:40,322
-What happened?
-Hennessey must have deactivated it. Bitch!

1483
01:38:42,530 --> 01:38:44,361
She's so pIeased with herseIf.

1484
01:38:45,290 --> 01:38:46,962
It's aII about to change.

1485
01:38:47,090 --> 01:38:48,443
Light me up.

1486
01:38:49,770 --> 01:38:53,206
What is with you and cigarettes, PauI?
I mean, cigarettes in this movie,

1487
01:38:53,290 --> 01:38:56,327
even in Event Horizon,
we had cigarettes in space.

1488
01:38:57,210 --> 01:38:58,962
I mean, you don't even smoke.

1489
01:39:03,210 --> 01:39:05,246
WeII, you can't make a prison movie
and not have cigarettes,

1490
01:39:05,330 --> 01:39:07,844
I mean, they're such a part of the fabric
of kind of prison Iife.

1491
01:39:07,930 --> 01:39:09,329
That's the currency, I guess.

1492
01:39:25,770 --> 01:39:27,965
Coach, we gotta get the firepower.

1493
01:39:28,050 --> 01:39:29,768
Nothing lit for a half lap.

1494
01:39:29,850 --> 01:39:31,841
We won't last that long!

1495
01:39:38,250 --> 01:39:39,842
So pIeased with himseIf.

1496
01:39:47,170 --> 01:39:48,159
This was a tough Iocation,

1497
01:39:48,250 --> 01:39:51,686
because at night we had to stop fiIming
at midnight,

1498
01:39:51,770 --> 01:39:54,728
because of the sound, the IocaI residents.

1499
01:39:54,810 --> 01:39:58,405
AIthough it was a rundown industriaI siIo,

1500
01:39:58,490 --> 01:40:00,799
there are actuaIIy
very expensive condos around.

1501
01:40:04,170 --> 01:40:06,889
WeII, aIso you're right by the water
and sound traveIs across the water.

1502
01:40:06,970 --> 01:40:09,165
I mean, we wouId...

1503
01:40:09,250 --> 01:40:13,004
You wouId be abIe to hear these gun
battIes from Iike 10 miIes away, in MontreaI.

1504
01:40:13,090 --> 01:40:16,560
The other side of MontreaI couId hear when
we started shooting these machine guns,

1505
01:40:16,650 --> 01:40:19,039
and aIso, these machine guns,
they are very Ioud.

1506
01:40:19,130 --> 01:40:21,086
You know, the concussive force
of these things are phenomenaI

1507
01:40:21,170 --> 01:40:22,888
when you stand very cIose to them.

1508
01:40:25,330 --> 01:40:29,039
Yeah, CharIie TayIor, our armourer,
who again we used on a number of fiIms,

1509
01:40:29,130 --> 01:40:32,406
briIIiant gun guy from Toronto,

1510
01:40:32,490 --> 01:40:35,482
just did an awesome job
getting this hardware together.

1511
01:40:37,450 --> 01:40:39,839
He did Resident Evil 2 and 3 for us.

1512
01:40:41,850 --> 01:40:43,044
Shit.

1513
01:40:43,130 --> 01:40:45,041
Lit shield in quarter lap.

1514
01:40:45,130 --> 01:40:46,961
Do you hear that?
Lit shield in the quarter lap.

1515
01:41:01,930 --> 01:41:03,682
He's coming up fast.

1516
01:41:04,770 --> 01:41:08,479
Let them get the shield.
Keep the viewers interested.

1517
01:41:17,610 --> 01:41:19,999
Son of a bitch! He got the shield!

1518
01:41:25,690 --> 01:41:27,282
Arm the explosive.

1519
01:41:28,090 --> 01:41:31,002
I Iove the production design inside
Hennessey's controI room.

1520
01:41:31,090 --> 01:41:34,048
AII the peeIing paint work coming off
the waIIs and the ceiIings.

1521
01:41:34,130 --> 01:41:37,600
I mean, that's aII reaI,
I mean, that's very hard to art direct.

1522
01:41:37,690 --> 01:41:42,366
You know, that kind of crumbIing
paint work feeI, I mean it's...

1523
01:41:42,450 --> 01:41:45,328
Even if you pay a fortune for it,
you can never reaIIy get it to Iook right.

1524
01:41:45,410 --> 01:41:47,241
And that was what was so great
about these Iocations

1525
01:41:47,330 --> 01:41:50,402
is having that kind of depth
and texture aIready existing.

1526
01:41:53,770 --> 01:41:57,922
Yeah, PauI Austerberry was very good
at buiIding on what was aIready there.

1527
01:41:58,010 --> 01:41:59,921
Yeah, aIthough we did buiId
some sets for this movie,

1528
01:42:00,010 --> 01:42:02,001
I mean, primariIy it is a 90% Iocation picture.

1529
01:42:02,090 --> 01:42:04,843
'Cause even when we did buiId things,
Iike the controI room,

1530
01:42:06,010 --> 01:42:07,841
we were buiIding on Iocation.

1531
01:42:13,450 --> 01:42:15,406
And that was kind of refreshing for us,
cause a Iot of our movies

1532
01:42:15,490 --> 01:42:17,879
tend to be very set-heavy, you know Iike
the Resident Evil fiIms

1533
01:42:17,970 --> 01:42:20,484
or Event Horizon, which is aII shot on set.

1534
01:42:21,010 --> 01:42:22,443
They're headed for the bridge.

1535
01:42:22,530 --> 01:42:24,998
Their weapons. Hit the kill switches.

1536
01:42:27,930 --> 01:42:31,479
This has to be
one of my favourite fiIming moments ever,

1537
01:42:31,570 --> 01:42:34,084
was hearing Joan AIIen swear Iike this.

1538
01:42:37,850 --> 01:42:41,240
And then especiaIIy in the scene coming up.

1539
01:42:41,330 --> 01:42:45,243
The ''Okay, cocksucker, fuck with me
and we'II see who shits on the sidewaIk. ''

1540
01:42:45,970 --> 01:42:48,564
The very first take of that
was compIeteIy unusabIe.

1541
01:42:48,650 --> 01:42:50,208
And not anything to do with Joan AIIen,

1542
01:42:50,290 --> 01:42:53,600
because her performance as aIways
is fantastic from take one onwards,

1543
01:42:53,690 --> 01:42:57,239
but the camera crew were so shocked,
to hear her swear,

1544
01:42:57,330 --> 01:42:59,764
'cause she is a very weII-spoken woman
in reaI Iife,

1545
01:42:59,850 --> 01:43:02,284
that you couId see the shots
aII going out of focus.

1546
01:43:02,370 --> 01:43:04,008
'Cause the focus puIIer
stopped paying attention.

1547
01:43:04,090 --> 01:43:06,126
They were just so stunned

1548
01:43:06,210 --> 01:43:09,247
that these words were coming
out of her mouth with such conviction.

1549
01:43:15,250 --> 01:43:17,047
Somebody's mad right now.

1550
01:43:17,130 --> 01:43:19,280
Nobody fucks with my car.

1551
01:43:22,250 --> 01:43:26,960
When Joan started working with us,
her agent sent her a Iarge basket of fIowers,

1552
01:43:27,050 --> 01:43:29,484
which agents normaIIy do
when actors start working on a movie.

1553
01:43:29,570 --> 01:43:33,040
And normaIIy they send a IittIe card
that says ''Good Iuck with the fiIm, Joan. ''

1554
01:43:33,130 --> 01:43:35,007
You know, ''Love, your agents. ''

1555
01:43:35,090 --> 01:43:37,650
She got the usuaI basket of fIowers
but when she opened the card it said,

1556
01:43:37,730 --> 01:43:41,518
''Okay, cocksucker, fuck with me
and we'II see who shits on the sidewaIk. ''

1557
01:43:42,650 --> 01:43:44,242
Yeah, her agent reaIIy...

1558
01:43:44,330 --> 01:43:46,161
I think that was the main reason
he wanted her to do the fiIm.

1559
01:43:46,250 --> 01:43:47,888
Was to hear her say that.

1560
01:43:48,490 --> 01:43:50,845
Just want to know who l'm riding with.

1561
01:43:54,130 --> 01:43:56,564
Jensen Ames.

1562
01:43:58,090 --> 01:43:59,887
-Like...
-Like the car.

1563
01:43:59,970 --> 01:44:01,039
Like the car.

1564
01:44:02,490 --> 01:44:05,562
Well, Jensen Ames, l hope you got a plan,

1565
01:44:05,690 --> 01:44:07,681
'cause it's not like
we're going to get very far.

1566
01:44:07,770 --> 01:44:08,919
You're right.

1567
01:44:10,210 --> 01:44:11,199
We won't.

1568
01:44:11,730 --> 01:44:13,880
And that was a Iot of diaIogue there

1569
01:44:13,970 --> 01:44:17,087
that was deIeted
from the theatricaI version of the movie.

1570
01:44:17,730 --> 01:44:19,163
You know,
we thought it was a nice moment,

1571
01:44:19,250 --> 01:44:20,524
but uItimateIy, you know,

1572
01:44:20,610 --> 01:44:22,726
when you're buiIding towards
the cIimax of a fiIm,

1573
01:44:22,810 --> 01:44:26,849
it feIt Iike that extra 25 seconds of diaIogue
was a IittIe redundant,

1574
01:44:26,930 --> 01:44:29,922
and kind of took away
from the dramatic buiId,

1575
01:44:30,010 --> 01:44:33,559
that the movie, and the head of steam
that the movie was estabIishing.

1576
01:44:33,650 --> 01:44:35,959
So for the theatricaI version,
we took that out.

1577
01:44:40,970 --> 01:44:42,847
Very nice modification.

1578
01:44:46,690 --> 01:44:50,046
AII that car crashing on the bridge, for reaI.

1579
01:44:50,130 --> 01:44:55,523
In fact, that shot where the gas tank
tumbIes towards the poIice cars,

1580
01:44:55,610 --> 01:44:57,441
again that was a reaI gas tank

1581
01:44:57,530 --> 01:45:01,045
and that, I think, was the Iast shot
I shot on the movie.

1582
01:45:01,130 --> 01:45:04,167
And you can kind of see the sky was
starting to get quite bIue in the background,

1583
01:45:04,250 --> 01:45:08,243
dawn was coming up,
and we were racing against the sun.

1584
01:45:23,490 --> 01:45:25,401
Choppers have a visual, ma'am.

1585
01:45:36,210 --> 01:45:39,919
Great heIicopter piIot, Fred North,

1586
01:45:40,930 --> 01:45:46,288
going cIoser than he probabIy shouId,
which we reaIIy appreciate.

1587
01:45:54,050 --> 01:45:56,518
Yeah, when you do those
kinds of aeriaI shots,

1588
01:45:56,610 --> 01:45:58,885
you know, the heIicopter piIot
is very much...

1589
01:45:58,970 --> 01:46:02,360
He is Iike the camera man,
you know, cause the heIicopter is...

1590
01:46:02,450 --> 01:46:03,439
The heIicopter and the camera

1591
01:46:03,530 --> 01:46:06,727
have to move in unison
to get you the shot you want.

1592
01:46:06,810 --> 01:46:08,766
So Fred, that's why we were so insistent
on getting him,

1593
01:46:08,850 --> 01:46:12,126
'cause I think he is probabIy the best guy
working in the industry right now.

1594
01:46:12,210 --> 01:46:16,601
And he wouId get the heIicopter reaI Iow
to the ground, I mean it was phenomenaI.

1595
01:46:16,690 --> 01:46:19,921
You know, he wouId IiteraIIy be skimming
the ground very Iow.

1596
01:46:22,690 --> 01:46:26,888
You know, he was originaIIy from MontreaI,
Fred, aIthough he Iives in L.A.

1597
01:46:26,970 --> 01:46:30,679
And his wife wouId run
the situation on the ground.

1598
01:46:30,770 --> 01:46:32,601
Very strong team.

1599
01:46:32,690 --> 01:46:34,248
Very expensive as weII.

1600
01:46:38,970 --> 01:46:41,040
-Worth every penny.
-Of course.

1601
01:46:41,130 --> 01:46:42,324
Or every cent.

1602
01:46:47,050 --> 01:46:50,008
So now they've escaped back
to the mainIand

1603
01:46:50,090 --> 01:46:52,126
and they're in kind of an industriaI area,

1604
01:46:52,210 --> 01:46:54,644
which you probabIy,
hopefuIIy you can't see it,

1605
01:46:54,730 --> 01:46:58,564
but this is actuaIIy exactIy the same pIace
where we started the movie.

1606
01:46:58,650 --> 01:47:00,959
This is the steeIworks where

1607
01:47:01,050 --> 01:47:02,608
-Jason is kind of queuing up...
-Right, was...

1608
01:47:02,690 --> 01:47:05,079
...to get his money and the riot is
aII in that area right there

1609
01:47:05,170 --> 01:47:08,287
that the heIicopters have just fIown over.

1610
01:47:08,370 --> 01:47:09,883
We were going to shoot it
in a different Iocation,

1611
01:47:09,970 --> 01:47:12,564
but uItimateIy I saw this one at night
and I thought, ''You know what,

1612
01:47:12,650 --> 01:47:14,720
''this is a better Iocation

1613
01:47:14,810 --> 01:47:18,041
''and no one's ever going to reaIise
that it's the same pIace. ''

1614
01:47:18,130 --> 01:47:19,961
Fantastic waII of fIame there.

1615
01:47:21,370 --> 01:47:22,883
This is reaIIy iconic.

1616
01:47:26,050 --> 01:47:28,166
They've stopped him, ma'am.

1617
01:47:38,970 --> 01:47:41,438
This was so difficuIt,
this poor stunt woman.

1618
01:47:41,530 --> 01:47:46,365
When I was shooting this, the downdraught
from the heIicopters was so great,

1619
01:47:46,450 --> 01:47:49,886
she was in constant danger
of being bIown off the top of that car.

1620
01:48:00,130 --> 01:48:02,280
Keep your hands where we can see them.

1621
01:48:02,370 --> 01:48:04,406
You are under arrest!

1622
01:48:04,490 --> 01:48:08,119
l repeat, keep your hands
where we can see them!

1623
01:48:08,210 --> 01:48:10,041
You are under arrest!

1624
01:48:15,330 --> 01:48:18,083
Hey, lgor. Merry Christmas.

1625
01:48:27,650 --> 01:48:29,083
You can see in that shot she's struggIing

1626
01:48:29,170 --> 01:48:31,400
to kind of stay on the top of the car, there.

1627
01:48:36,850 --> 01:48:40,638
I Iove that steaming river of effIuent
or whatever it was.

1628
01:48:40,730 --> 01:48:43,164
It was reaIIy unpIeasant-Iooking,

1629
01:48:43,250 --> 01:48:46,208
I was very happy to see it
when I turned up on Iocation that night.

1630
01:48:46,290 --> 01:48:48,121
'Cause during the day,
that steaming didn't occur.

1631
01:48:48,210 --> 01:48:49,325
It was onIy kind of in the middIe of the night

1632
01:48:49,410 --> 01:48:52,129
when the temperature dropped,
that you saw aII that steam.

1633
01:48:52,610 --> 01:48:53,725
Nice.

1634
01:48:55,170 --> 01:48:58,082
The fact you have duds like these
might make someone question your...

1635
01:48:58,170 --> 01:49:00,479
-My taste?
-Yeah. So to speak.

1636
01:49:00,570 --> 01:49:02,561
l don't know about you,
but l'm headed to Miami.

1637
01:49:02,730 --> 01:49:06,609
This interior was shot on a... Back at the...

1638
01:49:07,610 --> 01:49:09,601
Back at AIstom
where we shot everything eIse,

1639
01:49:09,690 --> 01:49:13,365
just a IittIe set there, train interior.

1640
01:49:16,930 --> 01:49:19,444
lt's a shame l didn't get to
take care of that bitch Hennessey.

1641
01:49:19,530 --> 01:49:22,044
Yeah. That is a shame.

1642
01:49:24,130 --> 01:49:28,089
We darkened the sky down considerabIy
here cause it was actuaIIy dawn

1643
01:49:28,170 --> 01:49:29,489
to get that shot.

1644
01:49:33,530 --> 01:49:35,088
Frankenstein has been retrieved.

1645
01:49:35,170 --> 01:49:38,128
And, ma'am, ratings are off the charts.

1646
01:49:39,130 --> 01:49:42,167
Gifts and congratulations
are already coming in.

1647
01:49:44,090 --> 01:49:45,648
You win again.

1648
01:49:46,090 --> 01:49:47,523
Mr Ulrich,

1649
01:49:49,610 --> 01:49:51,202
l always win.

1650
01:49:53,570 --> 01:49:54,798
Damn.

1651
01:50:02,290 --> 01:50:03,882
l love this game.

1652
01:50:11,770 --> 01:50:13,681
And that's originaIIy where the movie ended,

1653
01:50:13,770 --> 01:50:17,809
with that sateIIite dish tumbIing
towards the camera and...

1654
01:50:18,290 --> 01:50:22,283
You know, there was, in an earIier version
of the script, there was another ending

1655
01:50:22,370 --> 01:50:25,601
where you'd show, kind of,
Jason reunited with his chiId.

1656
01:50:25,690 --> 01:50:30,764
And after we finished shooting the movie,
and we tested the fiIm,

1657
01:50:30,850 --> 01:50:34,968
the movie pIayed great
and we got huge appIause at the end.

1658
01:50:35,050 --> 01:50:37,359
But the one thing that I think
the audience were missing

1659
01:50:37,450 --> 01:50:39,441
was a sense of resoIution

1660
01:50:39,530 --> 01:50:43,409
for Jason, and for Tyrese,
and aIso for NataIie's character.

1661
01:50:43,490 --> 01:50:46,880
So we kind of, we came up with this.
I mean it wasn't too dissimiIar

1662
01:50:46,970 --> 01:50:50,280
to what had been written
in an earIier draft of the screenpIay.

1663
01:50:50,370 --> 01:50:52,122
By this point, we were out of MontreaI,

1664
01:50:52,210 --> 01:50:55,407
and we were editing the movie down
in Los AngeIes.

1665
01:50:55,490 --> 01:50:58,800
So what we did was
we shot aII of this in The VaIIey.

1666
01:50:59,690 --> 01:51:02,124
And it's aII in a junkyard in The VaIIey.

1667
01:51:02,210 --> 01:51:05,247
We dumped four tons of sand down,

1668
01:51:05,330 --> 01:51:07,969
'cause this aII bIacktop
in the originaI junkyard.

1669
01:51:08,050 --> 01:51:13,204
So we put the sand down to make it seem a
IittIe more kind of Mexican, a bit more dusty.

1670
01:51:13,290 --> 01:51:16,805
And then, smaII factoid,
that car that NataIie just drove up in

1671
01:51:16,890 --> 01:51:20,724
is actuaIIy Vin DieseI's car,
from Fast and Furious,

1672
01:51:20,810 --> 01:51:23,278
which wiII be out
this coming summer, I beIieve.

1673
01:51:23,370 --> 01:51:25,008
I'm not sure that Vin knows that,
actuaIIy, PauI...

1674
01:51:25,090 --> 01:51:27,046
WeII, he does now.

1675
01:51:27,130 --> 01:51:29,086
-Yeah, we...
-We gave it a different paintjob there

1676
01:51:29,170 --> 01:51:30,569
so it doesn't Iook quite the same.

1677
01:51:30,650 --> 01:51:33,847
We had the same picture car coordinator

1678
01:51:33,930 --> 01:51:39,129
that does the Fast and Furious fiIms,
Dennis McCarthy, who is a briIIiant car guy.

1679
01:51:43,770 --> 01:51:44,759
What took you so long?

1680
01:51:44,850 --> 01:51:46,806
Had trouble getting
my release papers approved.

1681
01:51:46,890 --> 01:51:49,529
NataIie Iooking very happy, aIthough,
actuaIIy, on the day, she wasn't so happy

1682
01:51:49,610 --> 01:51:54,161
because she was actuaIIy on hoIiday
in Hawaii and we had to bring her back,

1683
01:51:54,250 --> 01:51:56,366
to come shoot in a scrap metaI yard.

1684
01:51:56,450 --> 01:51:58,042
She has beautiful eyes.

1685
01:51:58,170 --> 01:51:59,239
They're her mother's.

1686
01:51:59,330 --> 01:52:00,649
Jason's IittIe baby.

1687
01:52:00,730 --> 01:52:03,722
As aIways, when you shoot
these kind of scenes,

1688
01:52:03,810 --> 01:52:06,961
that IittIe girI is actuaIIy an identicaI twin.

1689
01:52:08,290 --> 01:52:12,363
'Cause you can onIy reaIIy have a chiId...
You can onIy work a chiId for an hour.

1690
01:52:12,450 --> 01:52:15,248
So to kind of doubIe the time you have,

1691
01:52:15,330 --> 01:52:18,959
you have identicaI twins so you get two
hours' worth of work out of the two kids.

1692
01:52:19,050 --> 01:52:21,280
And you tend to just put whichever one
in camera,

1693
01:52:21,370 --> 01:52:23,759
in front of the camera
is kind of behaving the most.

1694
01:52:26,530 --> 01:52:29,363
But when you work with chiIdren,
everything revoIves around them, reaIIy.

1695
01:52:29,450 --> 01:52:31,725
And when it's nap time, it's nap time.

1696
01:52:31,810 --> 01:52:34,165
When you have a chiId, isn't that the case,
PauI, as you've just had one?

1697
01:52:34,250 --> 01:52:36,639
Yes, yes,
everything revoIves around your chiId.

1698
01:52:36,730 --> 01:52:39,164
ReaIIy, your biggest production
is going on at home.

1699
01:52:39,250 --> 01:52:40,729
-My greatest production.
-Yeah.

1700
01:52:40,810 --> 01:52:42,129
CertainIy my best.

1701
01:52:49,890 --> 01:52:51,005
This is...

1702
01:52:51,210 --> 01:52:53,929
This discIaimer is something
we IegaIIy had to put at the end,

1703
01:52:54,010 --> 01:52:55,841
but I Iove it, I think it's so funny.

1704
01:52:55,930 --> 01:52:57,602
-Just think...
-Makes me Iaugh every time.

1705
01:52:57,690 --> 01:53:00,079
Just the thought that someone maybe

1706
01:53:00,170 --> 01:53:02,479
wiII go and strap a heavy machine gun
to the front of their car

1707
01:53:02,570 --> 01:53:04,526
and start shooting away on the freeway.

1708
01:53:08,810 --> 01:53:11,119
Now, of course,
foIIows the endIess end credits,

1709
01:53:11,210 --> 01:53:13,519
which none of you are going to watch
on DVD or BIu-ray.

1710
01:53:13,610 --> 01:53:16,920
But I wouId recommend
fast forwarding to the end,

1711
01:53:17,010 --> 01:53:19,399
because there's
a speciaI IittIe surprise there.

1712
01:53:19,490 --> 01:53:23,005
My favourite Iine of diaIogue from the movie
repeated one Iast time.

1713
01:53:26,690 --> 01:53:28,885
So Jeremy and I are no different
to the rest of you,

1714
01:53:28,970 --> 01:53:31,120
we're not going to
sit and watch the credits either.

1715
01:53:31,210 --> 01:53:33,280
It's been a pIeasure taIking
about Death Race,

1716
01:53:33,370 --> 01:53:36,840
it's a movie that took 14 years to make.
It's a reaI Iabour of Iove for us.

1717
01:53:36,930 --> 01:53:40,047
We couIdn't be more happy
and more proud of the fiIm,

1718
01:53:40,810 --> 01:53:42,641
and I hope you reaIIy enjoyed it.

1719
01:53:45,010 --> 01:53:50,448
-So that's Jeremy signing off.
