1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,738
<i>With regard to his memory loss,</i>

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:06,019
<i>he could be feigning,
exaggerating or simply...</i>

3
00:00:06,019 --> 00:00:07,429
<i>malingering.</i>

4
00:00:07,429 --> 00:00:09,759
Now, I feel I have no choice,
other than to remand her

5
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:12,058
to the Seapark Juvenile
Justice Centre in Bangor.

6
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,638
I don't care what you do.

7
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,218
The only one who's honest is Paul.

8
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:17,809
The police say they have fresh
evidence to put to Spector.

9
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:20,009
- What sort of evidence?
<i>- Apparently they have found</i>

10
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:21,629
<i>a lock-up rented by Spector.</i>

11
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:25,178
- Why are you in this place?
- I twisted my sister's arm.

12
00:00:25,179 --> 00:00:27,539
<i>After he broke his sister's arm,
he raped her...</i>

13
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:28,849
and carried her into the street,

14
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:31,259
threw her into a passing bin lorry
that crushed her to death.

15
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,478
No-one has any idea how bad
Gortnacull House was.

16
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:36,058
Are you certain that Baldwin,

17
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,598
Paul Spector,
was Jensen's favourite?

18
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,189
Every night and every day
for a full year.

19
00:00:41,189 --> 00:00:42,518
Paul Spector,

20
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,618
I am further arresting you

21
00:00:44,619 --> 00:00:46,319
for the murder of Susan Harper

22
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,378
on the 18th of August 2002.

23
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,289
I insist this interview
be suspended.

24
00:00:51,289 --> 00:00:53,039
I must take instruction
from Mr Spector.

25
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,848
Do you recognise this man?
Do you know his name?

26
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:57,679
- David Alvarez.
- This interview stops now.

27
00:00:57,679 --> 00:00:58,979
What is going on?

28
00:00:59,469 --> 00:01:00,939
The police have been clever.

29
00:01:00,939 --> 00:01:03,939
They have something on me
that I can actually remember.

30
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,209
<i>I'd worked that day,</i>

31
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:15,879
<i>in a Caribbean restaurant.</i>

32
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:17,900
It was a warm day.

33
00:01:18,569 --> 00:01:19,969
There was thundery rain.

34
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:23,530
David and I went out after work,

35
00:01:23,989 --> 00:01:25,459
went out drinking.

36
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,439
We went to a local club,
I can't recall the name.

37
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,259
We met Susan Harper there.

38
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:35,079
She invited us to her house.

39
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:37,438
I think she shared a house,

40
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:38,740
but there was no-one there.

41
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,900
- We went up to her room.
- The three of you?

42
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,009
Yes.

43
00:01:45,009 --> 00:01:46,700
What happened?

44
00:01:50,689 --> 00:01:52,159
She and David had sex.

45
00:01:53,689 --> 00:01:54,990
And you?

46
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,319
I watched.

47
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:01,200
What sort of sex?

48
00:02:04,629 --> 00:02:06,299
Ordinary sex.

49
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,599
What happened then?

50
00:02:11,969 --> 00:02:13,270
David left.

51
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:17,930
He went out to find more drink.

52
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:19,949
He left us together.

53
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,639
Go on.

54
00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:27,370
We...

55
00:02:30,069 --> 00:02:32,710
I invited her to try
something a bit different.

56
00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:34,870
What?

57
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:37,780
A sex game.

58
00:02:41,259 --> 00:02:42,728
What happened was an accident.

59
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:45,688
- A consensual game?
- Yes.

60
00:02:45,689 --> 00:02:48,418
Then how did this David Alvarez

61
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,149
individual come to be found
guilty if he wasn't even there?

62
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:53,699
And why murder,
why not manslaughter?

63
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,420
It's complicated.

64
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:01,139
Did David Alvarez find somewhere
to sell him drink?

65
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:03,120
I don't know.
He never came back.

66
00:03:06,389 --> 00:03:08,340
Could I please have some water?

67
00:03:18,189 --> 00:03:19,879
Have you...

68
00:03:21,689 --> 00:03:24,409
..remembered more in regard
to the other charges?

69
00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:27,370
No.

70
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:34,789
It will look bad if you stop
answering now.

71
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:40,229
Erm...just be careful what you say.

THE FALL
Final Episode of Series

75
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:00,550
So at that point you were left
alone with Susan Harper?

76
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,179
Yes.

77
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,479
What happened then?

78
00:04:05,129 --> 00:04:07,718
I suggested that she tried
something, erm,

79
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:09,218
a bit more exciting

80
00:04:09,219 --> 00:04:11,080
than the sex
that she'd had with David.

81
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:13,860
What?

82
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:16,860
I'd been experimenting.

83
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:18,949
With?

84
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,850
Exhibit 132.

85
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:34,468
I've never seen these before.

86
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:36,829
<i>- You admit it's you?
- He admits no such thing.</i>

87
00:04:36,829 --> 00:04:38,278
Experimenting like that,

88
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:40,499
<i>with sexual asphyxiation.
Is that</i>

89
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,009
<i>the sort of behaviour you
involved Susan Harper in?</i>

90
00:04:43,009 --> 00:04:45,050
I advise you not to answer
that question.

91
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:47,740
Yes.

92
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,749
How?

93
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,100
Specifically.

94
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,610
Her head in a plastic bag.

95
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,459
Tied off at the neck?

96
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:04,288
No,
just a thin plastic bag.

97
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:05,899
Did you tie her hands?

98
00:05:05,899 --> 00:05:08,238
No, her hands were free.

99
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,089
<i>Was it your suggestion
to use the bag?</i>

100
00:05:10,529 --> 00:05:12,579
<i>- Yes.
- Why?</i>

101
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:15,728
<i>For the same reasons as</i>

102
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:17,180
<i>in these pictures,</i>

103
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,939
<i>to feel in control,
to feel out of control...</i>

104
00:05:20,939 --> 00:05:22,240
to feel powerful,

105
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:24,149
to feel weak,

106
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,839
to be fearful,

107
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,860
- to be trusted.
- Were you supposed to remove it?

108
00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:31,240
She was...

109
00:05:31,709 --> 00:05:33,369
at the peak of orgasm,

110
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:34,670
to tear off the bag,

111
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:39,050
it floods the brain with
oxygen-laden blood,

112
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,199
leads to a feeling of euphoria.

113
00:05:41,569 --> 00:05:42,870
Or death.

114
00:05:44,829 --> 00:05:47,069
- Sadly, yes.
- Sadly?

115
00:05:50,209 --> 00:05:52,750
Did she understand the risks
involved with such behaviour?

116
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:56,399
- I think so.
- Did you explain it?

117
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:59,149
I don't remember.

118
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:02,459
Why didn't you remove the bag for
her if she lost consciousness?

119
00:06:02,459 --> 00:06:04,180
Could you not see she was
suffocating?

120
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:07,259
I wasn't looking at her.

121
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,540
I was going down on her.

122
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:13,759
We'd been drinking,

123
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,759
taken coke.
Maybe that's why she died.

124
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:18,689
And yet David Alvarez,

125
00:06:18,689 --> 00:06:20,839
who wasn't even there
at the time,

126
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:24,410
is serving a life sentence
for the murder.

127
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,928
His choice.

128
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:30,430
Why would he make that choice,
do you think?

129
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:33,409
I don't know.

130
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,180
You'll have to ask him.

131
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,569
So what did you do when you
realised what had happened?

132
00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:41,870
Did you call for an ambulance?
Did you call the police?

133
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,079
- No.
- Why not?

134
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:48,338
- It didn't occur to me.
- What did you do?

135
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,639
Cleaned up.

136
00:06:50,569 --> 00:06:51,889
Does that account
for the presence

137
00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:53,430
of a washing-up bowl by the bed?

138
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:57,409
Yes.

139
00:06:58,449 --> 00:07:00,189
I fetched the water and washed her.

140
00:07:01,019 --> 00:07:02,329
Emptied it into the bath.

141
00:07:02,329 --> 00:07:04,329
I was meant to bring it back
to the kitchen.

142
00:07:04,709 --> 00:07:06,149
I must have forgotten.

143
00:07:06,149 --> 00:07:10,009
- What colour bowl?
- Green, I think.

144
00:07:10,009 --> 00:07:12,509
So you just left her there,
in her room?

145
00:07:12,509 --> 00:07:13,810
On her bed?

146
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,329
- Yes.
- What did you do then?

147
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:19,649
- I walked the streets.
- And after that?

148
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:24,379
Left London.
I came back to Belfast.

149
00:07:24,379 --> 00:07:26,689
- And that's when you became
Paul Spector?
- Yes.

150
00:07:26,689 --> 00:07:28,930
Did you have any communication
with David Alvarez?

151
00:07:29,579 --> 00:07:31,759
- No.
- At no point?

152
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,409
No.

153
00:07:34,409 --> 00:07:35,939
I ask you again,

154
00:07:35,939 --> 00:07:37,480
why would he take the blame,

155
00:07:38,009 --> 00:07:39,310
do you think?

156
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:45,629
He must have felt he was doing
the right thing, I suppose.

157
00:07:45,629 --> 00:07:47,019
And why would he think...

158
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:49,189
..taking the blame

159
00:07:49,189 --> 00:07:50,590
was the right thing to do?

160
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:54,029
You tell me.

161
00:07:57,209 --> 00:07:59,110
He said he felt in your debt.

162
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:03,259
She speaks.

163
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,199
He said he felt
he owed you a great deal.

164
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:09,750
Because you protected him
as a child.

165
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:11,720
Did I?

166
00:08:13,709 --> 00:08:15,660
You told me...

167
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:19,310
that Father Jensen
didn't abuse you at Gortnacull.

168
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:23,139
You said that you made
yourself repulsive

169
00:08:23,139 --> 00:08:24,649
so that he wouldn't touch you.

170
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,720
I don't remember that.

171
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,129
I don't recall talking
to you before.

172
00:08:32,529 --> 00:08:34,980
But every boy there was abused
in some way.

173
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:38,149
No-one escaped.

174
00:08:39,139 --> 00:08:40,679
In fact,

175
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:42,928
some boys were singled out

176
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:44,379
for special treatment.

177
00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:47,830
And you

178
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:51,129
were one of Father Jensen's
favourites.

179
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:54,340
He even had a pet name for you.

180
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,220
He called you "Pretty Boy".

181
00:09:00,259 --> 00:09:02,109
He chose you to be his favourite

182
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:03,600
for a whole year.

183
00:09:07,049 --> 00:09:10,350
When it came time for you
to choose your successor...

184
00:09:11,549 --> 00:09:14,149
..you looked right past
David Alvarez.

185
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,429
You chose another boy.

186
00:09:18,769 --> 00:09:20,070
And, for that,

187
00:09:20,409 --> 00:09:22,200
he was eternally grateful.

188
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:26,838
Or at least until

189
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,840
it became clear
that the friend that he was

190
00:09:30,179 --> 00:09:33,029
protecting from an unfortunate
fatal accident

191
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,859
was actually a friend who was,
at that time,

192
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:39,549
at the beginning of a career
as a serial murderer.

193
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,759
Drop the charade, Peter.

194
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:48,169
Own your confession.

195
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:52,570
Have the courage of your convictions

196
00:09:53,049 --> 00:09:55,070
and admit that you remember it all.

197
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:58,778
You remember everything.

198
00:09:58,779 --> 00:10:00,528
I'm sorry,
but you are intentionally

199
00:10:00,529 --> 00:10:02,379
prejudicing my client's case.

200
00:10:02,379 --> 00:10:04,769
<i>I will want this removed
from the transcripts.</i>

201
00:10:05,529 --> 00:10:08,509
<i>Were you not worried that
the police would come after you?</i>

202
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:12,200
<i>Come after Peter Baldwin,
do you mean?</i>

203
00:10:12,909 --> 00:10:14,328
<i>Of no fixed</i>

204
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:15,740
<i>abode somewhere
in London?</i>

205
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,879
<i>No, I wasn't.</i>

206
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:21,450
A year later I was Paul Spector,

207
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,169
living in Belfast,

208
00:10:23,769 --> 00:10:26,009
soon to become
a married man

209
00:10:26,009 --> 00:10:27,309
with a child.

210
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,379
Truth be told,
I didn't give Alvarez

211
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:32,039
and Susan Harper much thought.

212
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:36,980
You know,

213
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:40,120
I've been told a lot about
Paul Spector,

214
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,899
since I was shot.

215
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:45,690
At first I was horrified,

216
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,899
but then, I must admit...

217
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:52,980
..little by little,

218
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:56,629
- he's started to intrigue me.
- Paul,

219
00:10:56,629 --> 00:10:58,088
please stick to the facts

220
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,919
surrounding the death
of Susan Harper...

221
00:11:00,419 --> 00:11:02,039
and avoid speculating

222
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,990
about things
you can't remember.

223
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,789
The speculation intrigues me.

224
00:11:12,009 --> 00:11:15,198
I'm told that I laid out Sarah
Kay's underwear on her bed,

225
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,500
in the shape of her body.

226
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:22,330
That's what I used to do as a child.

227
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:27,249
Lay out my mother's clothes

228
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,629
on her bed, in her shape,

229
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,690
imagine she was there.

230
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:37,129
It aroused me.

231
00:11:39,889 --> 00:11:42,769
When I was a wee bit older,
12, 13,

232
00:11:43,629 --> 00:11:45,649
whenever I could,
I would obtain

233
00:11:45,649 --> 00:11:47,200
female underwear.

234
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,929
I'd use it to masturbate.

235
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:54,289
<i>Is that perverse?</i>

236
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,460
<i>Was that the start of something
that led me here?</i>

237
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,710
Or was it earlier?

238
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:04,789
Gortnacull?

239
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:08,179
Or earlier still, my mother's death?

240
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:11,980
I want to know.

241
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:14,600
I want to know the real me.

242
00:12:17,889 --> 00:12:20,830
Then stop hiding behind
the mask of amnesia.

243
00:12:23,029 --> 00:12:25,519
We're all wearing masks
to some extent.

244
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:28,490
You certainly are.

245
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:33,870
There are memories,

246
00:12:34,649 --> 00:12:35,950
thoughts that

247
00:12:36,549 --> 00:12:38,000
feel like memories...

248
00:12:40,029 --> 00:12:41,889
..that are starting
to come back to me.

249
00:12:41,889 --> 00:12:44,999
This interview has strayed way
beyond its stated purpose.

250
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,299
And there's a voice.

251
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,418
There's a voice saying,
"We're losing him,

252
00:12:53,419 --> 00:12:54,899
"we're losing him."

253
00:12:57,049 --> 00:12:58,359
So,

254
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,869
there must have been at least
one person who cared

255
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:02,169
whether I lived or died.

256
00:13:06,769 --> 00:13:08,070
That was me.

257
00:13:10,049 --> 00:13:11,450
That was my voice.

258
00:13:13,889 --> 00:13:15,230
And I did care.

259
00:13:16,889 --> 00:13:19,669
I thought death would
be too easy for you,

260
00:13:20,909 --> 00:13:22,549
too easy an escape.

261
00:13:24,289 --> 00:13:26,679
And I didn't want you to
cheat the system.

262
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:29,080
And I still don't.

263
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,649
I want you to be punished

264
00:13:31,649 --> 00:13:33,080
for the crimes
that you've committed.

265
00:13:37,669 --> 00:13:38,970
Rose Stagg

266
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:41,370
was so right about you.

267
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:45,139
She saw right through you,

268
00:13:45,889 --> 00:13:50,668
your infantile desire
to have a captive

269
00:13:50,669 --> 00:13:52,340
and captivated audience.

270
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:56,220
You just want to be noticed,

271
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,399
you want to be
the centre of attention,

272
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:02,769
to have special treatment,

273
00:14:03,299 --> 00:14:05,299
to make your mark.

274
00:14:08,129 --> 00:14:10,320
But it's all just a performance.

275
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,120
All of it.

276
00:14:12,539 --> 00:14:14,070
You perform for me,

277
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:16,059
for your solicitor,

278
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:19,889
your doctors, your nurse,
your psychiatrist,

279
00:14:20,379 --> 00:14:21,679
even your family.

280
00:14:23,809 --> 00:14:25,110
It's all just

281
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:28,490
one big performance...

282
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:31,389
..as protection

283
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:33,418
against the dreaded

284
00:14:33,419 --> 00:14:35,769
black hole of your heart.

285
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:43,750
Well, guess what,
Paul,

286
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:46,649
it's time to grow up.

287
00:14:50,009 --> 00:14:53,100
It's time to take responsibility
for what you've done.

288
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:57,460
Let's stop this pathetic charade.

289
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:02,009
I really must insist on a break now.

290
00:15:02,009 --> 00:15:04,078
I need time with my client
to prepare

291
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,359
a written statement
about the death

292
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,120
of Susan Harper
that he will read.

293
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,438
Interview is being suspended

294
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,188
at 15.47 so that Paul Spector

295
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:23,000
can consult with his solicitor.

296
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,789
Fetch the detention officer.

297
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:18,338
Get your hands off me!
Get your hands off me!

298
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:20,609
Don't touch me! Do you hear me?!

299
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:22,490
Don't you put your hands on me!

300
00:16:23,299 --> 00:16:24,940
Have you been drinking?

301
00:16:41,009 --> 00:16:43,469
You, escort Mr Healy
out of here! You...

302
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:45,919
- where's that fucking ambulance?!
- It's all right.

303
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:55,659
It's all right, it's all right.

304
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:05,890
Drive.

305
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,009
Drive!

306
00:18:00,029 --> 00:18:02,869
- I'm shaking.
- How much did you see?

307
00:18:03,509 --> 00:18:06,609
My monitor went dead.
The attack on Gibson.

308
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:08,449
It didn't stop there.

309
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:10,749
- What a way for the whole thing to end.
- End?

310
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,328
What do you mean?

311
00:18:12,329 --> 00:18:14,558
We can't possibly represent him now.

312
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:15,868
Why not?

313
00:18:15,869 --> 00:18:18,288
I've never seen violence
like that before in my life.

314
00:18:18,289 --> 00:18:19,759
What have we just witnessed?

315
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:21,788
The very thing you described.

316
00:18:21,789 --> 00:18:23,348
Their deep obsession
with each other.

317
00:18:23,349 --> 00:18:25,608
The emergence under duress
of "Bad Paul".

318
00:18:25,609 --> 00:18:27,409
If Larson doesn't find evidence

319
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:29,769
of dissociative disorder,
a split personality,

320
00:18:29,769 --> 00:18:32,179
then we will find a psychiatrist
who does.

321
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:34,699
Then we play the "not guilty by
reason of insanity" card or even,

322
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,949
if necessary, "guilty but insane".

323
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:40,009
I can't, Sean, I can't be in
the same room with him again.

324
00:18:40,009 --> 00:18:41,709
I get it.
You admire her.

325
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:43,199
You want to be her when you grow up.

326
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,509
The fact remains,

327
00:18:44,509 --> 00:18:46,479
if you can't make the accused
your focus

328
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,038
then you shouldn't be
a defence lawyer,

329
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:49,548
probably not
a criminal lawyer at all.

330
00:18:49,549 --> 00:18:50,849
Fine.

331
00:18:51,579 --> 00:18:53,930
- What?
- You're on your own.

332
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,130
Open your mouth for me.

333
00:20:41,619 --> 00:20:43,210
Bring your teeth together.

334
00:20:45,029 --> 00:20:46,329
Painful?

335
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:48,298
No, no.

336
00:20:48,299 --> 00:20:51,308
No crunching noises.
Any problems with vision?

337
00:20:51,309 --> 00:20:52,618
No.

338
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:55,729
I think you have a minimally
displaced zygoma fracture.

339
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:59,079
You're going to be on a soft diet
for two weeks or so.

340
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:01,788
Though the bleeding's
impressive,

341
00:21:01,789 --> 00:21:03,609
the lacerations small.

342
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:06,489
Might require a stitch or two.
Irrigate the wound

343
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:09,219
with lots of normal saline
and I'll take a look.

344
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:11,680
If you'd like to lie back on the bed
for me, please.

345
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,680
- Any pain?
- Some.

346
00:21:33,109 --> 00:21:35,750
- Shall I check for blood in the urine?
- Yes, please.

347
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,068
I'd like to keep you in overnight
for observation.

348
00:21:47,069 --> 00:21:49,209
- That won't be necessary.
- Don't worry,

349
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:50,700
it'll just be bed and breakfast.

350
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:53,089
I'll be back to stitch that eyebrow.

351
00:23:17,269 --> 00:23:19,900
Thought I'd look in on
you before I go.

352
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:23,088
What time is it?

353
00:23:23,089 --> 00:23:24,769
Just after two.

354
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:28,868
This is my ninth straight night
in a row.

355
00:23:28,869 --> 00:23:30,950
I've been on for 17 hours.

356
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:33,559
Getting too old for this.

357
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:38,779
I bet you're glad I saved his life.

358
00:23:44,829 --> 00:23:46,490
How's Tom Anderson?

359
00:23:47,019 --> 00:23:48,569
His arm's broken.

360
00:23:49,579 --> 00:23:51,288
He's undergone
a closed reduction

361
00:23:51,289 --> 00:23:53,378
to pull the bones
back into position.

362
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:55,259
He's been sent home with
his arm in a cast.

363
00:23:57,730 --> 00:24:01,538
Given that you're less likely
to develop

364
00:24:01,539 --> 00:24:04,578
post-traumatic stress disorder
if you don't sleep

365
00:24:04,579 --> 00:24:07,259
after a bad experience,

366
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:10,390
maybe I should...keep you awake
a wee bit longer at least.

367
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,329
Don't you have a home to go to?

368
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:17,739
I do. A wife and five kids,
as it happens,

369
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:20,199
from a daughter of 12 to a son of
seven months.

370
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,609
If I go home now,

371
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,250
it'll be nappy changes
and the four o'clock feed.

372
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,769
Might as well sit with you
for a bit.

373
00:24:29,309 --> 00:24:31,089
I'll ask you questions.

374
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:33,930
- Really?
- Aye.

375
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,000
Go on.

376
00:24:39,289 --> 00:24:41,289
Do you like flowers?

377
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,299
Of course.

378
00:24:46,099 --> 00:24:48,980
Can you play any musical instrument?

379
00:24:50,119 --> 00:24:53,049
I could play the violin
when I was a girl.

380
00:24:54,289 --> 00:24:55,888
Have you ever been happy?

381
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:57,390
If so, when?

382
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,450
When I was a child,

383
00:25:01,089 --> 00:25:02,690
before my father died.

384
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:09,880
Have you any real friends?

385
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:13,349
A few, yeah.

386
00:25:15,289 --> 00:25:17,160
Have you ever wished anyone dead?

387
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,940
Yes, I have.

388
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:28,019
Are you a good swimmer?

389
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:31,430
Very.

390
00:25:32,549 --> 00:25:36,049
Are men or women the stronger,
do you think?

391
00:25:38,529 --> 00:25:41,609
- What do you think?
- Women, without a doubt.

392
00:25:42,809 --> 00:25:45,183
In fact, it's time you hurried up
and took over.

393
00:25:45,184 --> 00:25:47,549
I mean, it's going to happen so
why not get on with it?

394
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,470
Which is your favourite season?

395
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:54,230
Spring.

396
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,298
<i>Has Mr Spector been
a threat to himself</i>

397
00:25:58,299 --> 00:25:59,868
<i>or others in the past week?</i>

398
00:25:59,869 --> 00:26:01,868
There have been no more
breaches of protocol

399
00:26:01,869 --> 00:26:03,220
since he's been back.

400
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:06,838
Anything more from the test results?

401
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:10,128
Have you found any compelling
inconsistencies?

402
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:11,719
No, I haven't.

403
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,648
Which is unsurprising

404
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:15,450
given his professional
knowledge.

405
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:19,568
I know it's in your
nature to infer

406
00:26:19,569 --> 00:26:22,778
invisible unconscious processes
behind the memory loss

407
00:26:22,779 --> 00:26:25,338
and that it is an exceptional
doctor

408
00:26:25,339 --> 00:26:29,108
who will take the risk of concluding
in writing that someone

409
00:26:29,109 --> 00:26:31,000
is malingering
but,

410
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,700
with respect,

411
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:35,180
that is what I think
you should do.

412
00:26:36,279 --> 00:26:38,439
- Do you?
- The CT head scan

413
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,769
with and without
contrast was normal,

414
00:26:40,769 --> 00:26:43,328
the MRI of the brain
and the spinal

415
00:26:43,329 --> 00:26:45,098
cord showed normal results.

416
00:26:45,099 --> 00:26:47,519
There's no evidence of
structural brain damage

417
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:50,279
in the neurological examinations
or neuroimaging.

418
00:26:50,779 --> 00:26:52,259
With his history of lying

419
00:26:52,259 --> 00:26:54,720
and everything
that he stands to gain

420
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:58,440
from exaggeration
and fabrication of the symptoms,

421
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:01,740
the amnesia has to be malingered.

422
00:27:03,049 --> 00:27:05,549
He's proved how dangerous he is.

423
00:27:06,259 --> 00:27:07,670
It has to be fake.

424
00:27:32,049 --> 00:27:33,349
It's not me.

425
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:35,269
What?

426
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,880
I look at my body and it's not me.

427
00:27:40,809 --> 00:27:42,960
It'll take a while to get used to,
that's all.

428
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:03,969
We've had a report,
ma'am,

429
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:06,088
from the Juvenile Offenders'
Centre.

430
00:28:06,089 --> 00:28:07,939
It seems that Katie Benedetto

431
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:09,650
has been self-harming.

432
00:28:10,049 --> 00:28:11,548
How?

433
00:28:11,549 --> 00:28:13,740
Cutting herself with
a piece of bone.

434
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,509
What?

435
00:28:15,509 --> 00:28:16,919
They think she must
have found it

436
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,420
in her food at some point.

437
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:21,380
Jesus.

438
00:28:25,339 --> 00:28:28,679
<i>Is there a happy memory
from any part of your life</i>

439
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,980
<i>that you can remember?'</i>

440
00:28:39,809 --> 00:28:42,559
I used to think that there was
a black hole inside me

441
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:44,599
that nothing could fill.

442
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:48,910
Then I had a daughter.

443
00:28:51,859 --> 00:28:54,460
I remember the first time that
I put her to sleep.

444
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,648
I was standing,

445
00:28:57,650 --> 00:28:59,160
holding her in my arms,

446
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,980
rocking her.

447
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:04,690
I was looking at her all the time.

448
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,859
She was looking up at me.

449
00:29:09,369 --> 00:29:11,480
I began to feel
that she trusted me,

450
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:14,490
that she felt safe.

451
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,559
She must have done because

452
00:29:19,079 --> 00:29:20,710
her eyelids started closing...

453
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:24,019
..little by little,

454
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,640
and then she was asleep.

455
00:29:31,369 --> 00:29:32,670
That's a good memory.

456
00:29:36,089 --> 00:29:38,259
Why did you attack Stella Gibson?

457
00:29:39,829 --> 00:29:42,380
Why did you break that
young man's arm?

458
00:29:52,599 --> 00:29:56,150
There is a visible
and an invisible world.

459
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:59,009
That's why people get hurt.

460
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,289
Do you think I'm treatable?

461
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,259
Of course.

462
00:30:16,859 --> 00:30:18,160
Curable?

463
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:23,109
That's different.

464
00:30:33,019 --> 00:30:35,109
What would you do for me
if I was your patient?

465
00:30:39,259 --> 00:30:41,638
Try to get you to pay attention

466
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,140
wisely to things as they are.

467
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:47,559
Foster clear thinking

468
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:49,559
and open-heartedness.

469
00:30:51,009 --> 00:30:54,009
Try to develop the capacity
in you

470
00:30:54,009 --> 00:30:56,558
to experience a feeling without

471
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:58,099
necessarily acting on it.

472
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:02,048
Try to enable you to see
the difference between

473
00:31:02,049 --> 00:31:03,700
thoughts and reality.

474
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:11,980
I'd imagine you're a good father.

475
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:14,789
What do you mean by "good father"?

476
00:31:19,609 --> 00:31:21,000
Someone who is present,

477
00:31:23,009 --> 00:31:24,339
there for his children.

478
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:38,759
<i>Has anyone ever told you
you sometimes have</i>

479
00:31:38,759 --> 00:31:40,888
<i>bad dreams that you
can't remember?</i>

480
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:43,099
Has your mummy or your daddy
ever told you that?

481
00:31:43,529 --> 00:31:45,358
Yes.
Mummy took me

482
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:47,119
to the doctor's one time.

483
00:31:48,289 --> 00:31:49,598
Have you had any bad dreams

484
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:51,648
since you've been staying
with Joan and Stephen?

485
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:53,240
I don't think so.

486
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:55,529
She hasn't.
She's been sleeping well.

487
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:58,338
Daddy said he had bad dreams
like mine when

488
00:31:58,339 --> 00:32:00,049
he was in the children's home.

489
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:02,880
Did he?

490
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,220
Did he say
what he dreamed about?

491
00:32:05,779 --> 00:32:07,230
Frightening things.

492
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:12,180
How do you feel about your daddy
right now, Olivia?

493
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:14,730
I love him.

494
00:32:15,329 --> 00:32:16,630
But?

495
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:19,339
I don't think I'll go see him
for a while.

496
00:32:22,309 --> 00:32:24,368
How long do you think before
you'll see him again?

497
00:32:24,369 --> 00:32:25,909
When I'm grown up I might.

498
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:27,490
Or if I have a baby.

499
00:32:28,309 --> 00:32:31,099
If I have a baby,
I might go take her to see him.

500
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:35,240
<i>What happened to your face?</i>

501
00:32:36,569 --> 00:32:38,440
I was in a car accident.

502
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:42,509
No, I wasn't.

503
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,839
Paul Spector attacked me.

504
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:57,589
I've got marks like that.

505
00:33:05,259 --> 00:33:07,730
- Show me.
- I can't.

506
00:33:08,289 --> 00:33:09,720
Why?

507
00:33:10,329 --> 00:33:13,390
They're on my upper thighs and on
the soles of my feet.

508
00:33:15,859 --> 00:33:17,549
I didn't want anyone to know,

509
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:19,380
to see them.

510
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:21,789
They were private.

511
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:25,779
Why did you do it?

512
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,910
I think for the same reason you do.

513
00:33:33,619 --> 00:33:34,920
What's that?

514
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:36,750
Anger.

515
00:33:40,329 --> 00:33:42,319
What did you have to be angry about?

516
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:45,380
My father.

517
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,569
Why?

518
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,779
He died.

519
00:33:56,769 --> 00:33:58,190
How?

520
00:34:00,849 --> 00:34:02,150
He was ill.

521
00:34:04,779 --> 00:34:06,190
How old were you?

522
00:34:07,089 --> 00:34:08,389
14.

523
00:34:15,309 --> 00:34:16,880
My father killed himself.

524
00:34:17,579 --> 00:34:19,150
I thought it was an accident.

525
00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:23,820
He chose to ride a motorbike.

526
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:28,369
Even though I worried about him
every time he went out...

527
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,139
..every night he was late home.

528
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:39,239
He loved the bike more than
he loved me.

529
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,278
Loved the thrill of speed

530
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,110
more than he loved
his only daughter.

531
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,199
I don't call that an accident.

532
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:53,789
Is that why you're throwing
your life away?

533
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:58,429
You know you can't get him back.

534
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:03,000
No matter how hard you try.

535
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,019
"There was a man of double deed,

536
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:34,269
"Who sowed his
garden full of seed;

537
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,599
"When the seed began to grow,

538
00:35:39,019 --> 00:35:41,179
"'Twas like a garden full of snow;

539
00:35:42,969 --> 00:35:44,679
"When the snow began to melt,

540
00:35:45,869 --> 00:35:47,949
"'Twas like a ship without a belt;

541
00:35:49,449 --> 00:35:51,300
"When the ship began to sail,

542
00:35:52,769 --> 00:35:55,530
"'Twas like a bird without a tail;

543
00:35:57,449 --> 00:35:59,420
"When the bird began to fly,

544
00:36:00,269 --> 00:36:03,010
"'Twas like an eagle in the sky;

545

"When the sky began to roar,

546
00:36:08,929 --> 00:36:11,920
"'Twas like a lion at my door;

"When my door began to crack,

"When my back began to smart,

"'Twas like a penknife in my heart;

"And when my heart began to bleed...

"..'Twas death,

"and death,

554

"and death indeed."

555
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:06,869
I need you to do me a favour.

556
00:37:10,349 --> 00:37:13,050
<i>I know that everything
feels tainted,</i>

557
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:15,079
<i>polluted.</i>

558
00:37:15,809 --> 00:37:17,110
But it's not.

559
00:37:23,409 --> 00:37:25,960
We all have those
voices in our heads,

560
00:37:26,409 --> 00:37:28,449
that tell us we're
a disappointment,

561
00:37:29,019 --> 00:37:31,519
that tell us our work
is insignificant.

562
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:34,338
That it's not good enough,

563
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:36,519
it takes too long,
it's too hard.

564
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,190
But when times are tough,

565
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,679
we need tough dreams.

566
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:48,139
But real dreams, not lies.

567
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:51,409
Not an unreality like Paul.

568
00:37:55,389 --> 00:37:57,849
You need to fight for yourself,
Katie,

569
00:37:59,829 --> 00:38:01,320
because right now...

570
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:04,219
..you're in danger.

571
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:31,940
What's this?

572
00:38:32,679 --> 00:38:33,980
It's your chocolate.

573
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:37,219
I don't want that chocolate.
I want what he's got.

574
00:38:37,219 --> 00:38:39,668
Mark, you're diabetic.
That's your special chocolate.

575
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:42,269
I don't like special chocolate.
I want what he's got.

576
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,778
This stuff tastes like
dog chocolate.

577
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,690
I'm not eating dog chocolate!

578
00:38:47,889 --> 00:38:49,199
I'm afraid it's this or nothing.

579
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:50,750
Then give me my money back.

580
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,650
I've spent your money
on the things you asked for.

581
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:55,510
I want my money back!

582
00:38:56,429 --> 00:38:58,528
- Mark, calm yourself.
- I'm not a dog.

583
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:00,039
I'm not eating that shit.
I refuse.

584
00:39:00,039 --> 00:39:01,978
Calm down, Mark,
or you'll be restrained.

585
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:04,088
What did you say to me?
You called me a homosexual!

586
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:06,498
- I didn't call you anything!
- You called me a homosexual!

587
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:07,800
Calm down now!

588
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:16,000
<i>We all need love</i>

589
00:40:16,469 --> 00:40:18,699
<i>and we all need nurture.</i>

590
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:22,070
<i>There's too much death
and destruction.</i>

591
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:25,239
But friends who
love you should...

592
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,230
..warm you like the sun.

593
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,510
Make you feel good about yourself.

594
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:36,938
Not freeze you in their contempt

595
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:38,380
and in their hate.

596
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:41,699
Anger corrodes our belief

597
00:40:41,699 --> 00:40:44,000
that anything good
can happen to us.

598
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:49,909
Paul's been destroyed
by his anger,

599
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,300
his rage.

600
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:56,719
And you,

601
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:59,250
you hurt a friend,

602
00:41:00,619 --> 00:41:01,920
to impress him.

603
00:41:06,489 --> 00:41:08,019
But he doesn't care.

604
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:14,110
He doesn't even know you exist.

605
00:41:56,849 --> 00:41:58,958
Watch his head, watch his head.

606
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:01,869
And out, and out.
Let's go! Let's go.

607
00:42:01,869 --> 00:42:04,099
Go, go, go!

608
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:20,128
Fuck off! That's right,
fuck the lot of you!

609
00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:22,340
Fuck off!

610
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:14,139
You and I were loved so much...

611
00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:18,320
..even if our fathers couldn't
stay around for us.

612
00:43:19,610 --> 00:43:22,530
Maybe we both need to be held
while we grieve,

613
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:27,329
but it has to be someone
who can feel pain for our pain,

614
00:43:28,989 --> 00:43:30,889
not revel in it.

615
00:43:32,639 --> 00:43:34,739
Not someone who will abandon us.

616
00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:10,329
Sweet Jesus.

617
00:45:10,329 --> 00:45:12,048
Somebody call for an ambulance!

618
00:45:12,050 --> 00:45:13,730
Call an ambulance.

619
00:45:14,099 --> 00:45:15,619
Where's Spector?

620
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:18,449
Where's Spector?!

621
00:45:45,849 --> 00:45:48,509
Check the treatment room!
The de-escalation room!

622
00:45:48,510 --> 00:45:50,170
Check the kitchen!

623
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:10,610
Shit!
Bailey's room!

624
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:20,849
God!

625
00:46:26,010 --> 00:46:27,628
Got him, got him.

626
00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:30,289
Quick. Mind his head,
mind his head, mind his head.

627
00:46:33,079 --> 00:46:34,860
Get the belt, get the belt.

628
00:46:37,449 --> 00:46:38,889
Paul, Paul.

629
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:50,619
I'm sorry.

630
00:46:53,929 --> 00:46:55,230
Gibson.

631
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:01,550
OK.

632
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:03,449
What is it?

633
00:47:05,769 --> 00:47:08,028
- I have to go.
- What's happened?

634
00:47:08,030 --> 00:47:10,108
I can't tell you.
I'm sorry.

635
00:47:10,110 --> 00:47:11,409
Is it Paul?

636
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:16,690
Bye, Katie.

637
00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:51,119
God, Dr Larson,

638
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:53,230
I'm sorry,

639
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:54,900
I'm so sorry.
