1
00:00:58,433 --> 00:00:59,978
<i>Mostly cloudy,
with scattered showers</i>

2
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:02,646
<i>and thunderstorms developing...</i>

3
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:04,231
Big storm tonight.

4
00:01:14,075 --> 00:01:16,868
Don't mean to pry,
but I can't imagine

5
00:01:17,036 --> 00:01:18,787
what a girl like you
wants to do at the lots.

6
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:39,182
Give me some money!

7
00:01:53,364 --> 00:01:54,948
Animals.

8
00:02:36,074 --> 00:02:38,241
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Mom. Hi.

9
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,828
<i>- You made it?</i>
- Yup.

10
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:41,871
<i>Storm coming tonight.</i>

11
00:02:42,038 --> 00:02:44,373
Yeah, I heard.
Can you put her on?

12
00:02:44,373 --> 00:02:49,170
<i>- Julia... she's asleep.</i>
- Please, mom.

13
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:51,254
Can you please call her over
so I can tell her goodnight?

14
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:54,008
<i>Julia, don't think
about her tonight.</i>

15
00:02:54,216 --> 00:02:55,300
Well, if she wakes up,

16
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:56,843
can you just please tell her
that I called?

17
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,262
<i>Okay.</i>

18
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:00,848
Don't forget.

19
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:03,558
<i>Focus on yourself.</i>

20
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:06,104
<i>I don't have to remind you
that this is your last chance</i>

21
00:03:06,104 --> 00:03:07,771
<i>or they'll take Clara away.</i>

22
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:09,731
Yeah, I know that, mom.

23
00:03:09,941 --> 00:03:11,651
<i>Remember your
breathing exercises.</i>

24
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:13,068
Yeah.

25
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:15,237
<i>I don't know how many more
opportunities you'll get.</i>

26
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:17,448
Yeah. Yeah, okay, mom.
I gotta go.

27
00:03:17,657 --> 00:03:18,783
Alright, bye.

28
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:40,763
- You're a student, correct?
- Yes, sir.

29
00:03:40,972 --> 00:03:42,973
I'm gonna become
a nurse someday.

30
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:44,599
Best of luck with all that.

31
00:03:48,062 --> 00:03:50,647
Around here you'll be
working the night shift.

32
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:52,400
Two guards man every shift.

33
00:03:52,567 --> 00:03:54,985
One guard on patrol duty,
the other on the screens.

34
00:03:56,236 --> 00:04:00,324
Wow.
What is this place?

35
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:02,826
The building was erected
during the big boom.

36
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:05,163
Assumption being
industry drives growth.

37
00:04:05,163 --> 00:04:07,831
Growth brings up demand for more
affordable luxury housing.

38
00:04:19,177 --> 00:04:21,762
Imagine living in a place
providing everything you need

39
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,973
for a comfortable life.

40
00:04:23,973 --> 00:04:26,057
You'd never have to leave.

41
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:29,978
And as you know,
boom became bust,

42
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:31,939
and here we are.

43
00:04:34,317 --> 00:04:35,942
What a waste.

44
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:39,988
You have to be careful here,
Ms. Streak.

45
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:42,949
Things are starting to...
fall apart.

46
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:52,209
Ballroom, grand hall, gym,

47
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:53,920
mail and storage rooms,

48
00:04:54,086 --> 00:04:57,590
plus a residential tower
30 floors high.

49
00:04:57,757 --> 00:05:00,675
As a patrol guard,
you make sure nobody gets in,

50
00:05:00,843 --> 00:05:03,387
nobody vandalizes the place,
nothing bad happens

51
00:05:03,387 --> 00:05:06,348
to the structure...
and nobody steals anything.

52
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:08,266
- Does that happen?
- All the time.

53
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:10,478
Steal whatever they can
get their hands on.

54
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:11,978
We've been having
issues of vagrancy,

55
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:13,396
tryin' to make
the place into a squat,

56
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:14,649
so don't let anyone in.

57
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:17,067
This job pays well for a reason.

58
00:05:17,276 --> 00:05:20,487
The nights here
can be long... and dark.

59
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:22,656
Some of the lights are on timers,

60
00:05:22,865 --> 00:05:24,658
so they turn off
to save on power.

61
00:05:24,867 --> 00:05:28,120
The combination can make
some people... uneasy.

62
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:29,997
I like the night.

63
00:05:31,499 --> 00:05:33,959
We've blanketed the entire
building with security cameras

64
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,877
so we only need two guards.

65
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:37,629
One on patrol and the other...

66
00:05:37,797 --> 00:05:40,007
In front of the screens.
Got it.

67
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:43,261
<i>- Where's the control room?
- Upstairs.</i>

68
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:52,478
I see your partner's
already here.

69
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:56,106
This is Dennis Cooper.

70
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:58,483
He's been here since day one.

71
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:02,237
Hi. Nice to meet you.

72
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:05,031
I'm Julia, but everybody
calls me Streak.

73
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,951
That's great.

74
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,331
Nice.

75
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:15,459
Cooper will take you
through the controls,

76
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:17,002
but I think you'll find
the system pretty intuitive

77
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:19,588
once you start using it.

78
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:21,757
You'll go on patrol
once every two hours.

79
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,968
Cooper will communicate with you

80
00:06:23,968 --> 00:06:26,345
using this headset.

81
00:06:26,345 --> 00:06:28,805
Packs a small camera
and a microphone.

82
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:32,183
Show us the feed, Cooper.

83
00:06:36,898 --> 00:06:38,941
Simple enough?

84
00:06:38,941 --> 00:06:41,903
Also, we've been having trouble
with electricity.

85
00:06:41,903 --> 00:06:43,528
We lose a video feed
from time to time

86
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,990
so you'll have to
throw a breaker.

87
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:47,365
Got it.

88
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:49,951
- You know what the breaker is?
- Yup.

89
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:53,122
Don't forget the uniform.

90
00:06:53,122 --> 00:06:55,081
That is the most important part
of this job.

91
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:59,086
Have a great night.

92
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,172
There is a locker room
in the back, to the right

93
00:07:01,172 --> 00:07:03,507
if you wanna change there.

94
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:08,178
Unless you feel more comfortable
changing in here, which...

95
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:12,182
I could probably make
an exception for that tonight.

96
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:14,185
I'm gonna go
to the locker room.

97
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,853
Okay.

98
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,048
This place is really big.

99
00:08:30,052 --> 00:08:32,929
A person could spend
a lifetime in here.

100
00:08:33,139 --> 00:08:35,432
Well, most people don't last
more than a week.

101
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:45,942
What's your story?

102
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,029
What's my story?

103
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:52,658
My story.
Um, let me see.

104
00:08:52,658 --> 00:08:57,955
It's a very long, detailed,
richly boring tale.

105
00:08:58,121 --> 00:09:00,707
However, let's start
with tonight's chapter.

106
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:03,335
I guess it starts out

107
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:06,212
that I'm sick and tired of Dixon

108
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:09,049
wheeling in some...

109
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,926
...local community college brat

110
00:09:10,926 --> 00:09:13,636
and expecting me to
entertain them all night.

111
00:09:15,306 --> 00:09:16,557
That's my story.

112
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:21,352
'Cause tomorrow or the next day
or possibly a week from now

113
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,980
but without question, it's going
to happen, you're gonna decide

114
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,859
that patrolling a big,
empty building every two hours

115
00:09:26,859 --> 00:09:28,568
is not what was meant for you

116
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,779
and your life
and big aspirations.

117
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,782
You're then gonna quit.

118
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:35,451
Then Dixon's gonna bring in
someone who's just like you

119
00:09:35,451 --> 00:09:36,869
and gonna sit
right in that chair,

120
00:09:36,869 --> 00:09:38,287
I'm gonna have
the same conversation

121
00:09:38,287 --> 00:09:41,289
and be forced to babysit
that person all night.

122
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:42,750
Really?

123
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,543
No tips, either.

124
00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:46,169
This is gonna be
a long night.

125
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:48,004
You have no idea.

126
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:51,509
Sorry, sweetheart.

127
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:53,927
Welcome to the
big world of security.

128
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:57,807
Excuse me.
Time to lock up.

129
00:10:00,142 --> 00:10:01,811
Lights out.

130
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:05,980
2, 3, 4. Ta-da.

131
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:29,922
Gross.

132
00:10:31,841 --> 00:10:35,635
It's weird. That happens
every time I try to burp.

133
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,227
What are you, 24?

134
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:48,857
25? 23?

135
00:10:51,902 --> 00:10:54,864
Alright, we're just
gonna stick with 24 then.

136
00:10:54,864 --> 00:10:56,573
What, are you
talking to me now?

137
00:10:56,782 --> 00:10:58,576
Tough, right?

138
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:01,870
Bet you were a good student.

139
00:11:02,037 --> 00:11:03,663
Little teacher's pet.

140
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:07,500
Am I right?

141
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:12,047
Fit. Like your arms.

142
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:15,259
You do a little
self-defense maybe?

143
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:19,053
Little karate?

144
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:21,639
Little, uh, tae kwon do?

145
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:24,934
Judo? Jiujitsu?
Jell-O wrestling?

146
00:11:26,979 --> 00:11:27,980
Pillow fights?

147
00:11:31,984 --> 00:11:33,402
Kickboxing, maybe?

148
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:34,695
Yeah.

149
00:11:35,738 --> 00:11:37,364
Yeah, I do kickboxing.

150
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:42,202
Yup. You have to for this job.

151
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:44,788
- Ho-ho. Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

152
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:47,040
Is that what Dixon told you?

153
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,918
I must've missed that one.
I can't kickbox.

154
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:53,963
Guess what?

155
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,051
You don't.

156
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:07,561
I don't think I've seen
one of these since 1982.

157
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:10,605
My grandma had one of these.

158
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:13,609
Do not touch my stuff!

159
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,951
That's quick... kickboxer.

160
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:31,793
Where you goin'?

161
00:12:31,961 --> 00:12:33,086
Patrol.

162
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:37,091
Not without this you're not.

163
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:49,602
Goes on like this.

164
00:13:46,243 --> 00:13:47,119
Um..

165
00:13:48,162 --> 00:13:50,080
<i>...do you miss me yet?</i>

166
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,206
- What are you doing?
- Me?

167
00:13:52,374 --> 00:13:54,209
<i>I'm not doing anything.</i>

168
00:13:56,003 --> 00:13:57,421
<i>Just a little, uh,</i>

169
00:13:57,421 --> 00:14:00,548
welcome ceremony,
a little initiation...

170
00:14:00,758 --> 00:14:02,342
to the security world.

171
00:14:06,263 --> 00:14:07,931
Open the door, Cooper.

172
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,936
- Cooper, this is not a game.
- Games?

173
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,188
<i>I don't play games.</i>

174
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,975
Cooper, let me out!

175
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:53,769
Cooper, let me out
of the elevator!

176
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,148
<i>Please, Cooper, let me out!</i>

177
00:14:58,315 --> 00:14:59,899
<i>Please, Cooper!
Please open the door!</i>

178
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:02,068
<i>Cooper!</i>

179
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:03,903
Open the door!

180
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:07,323
<i>Relax. I'm just testing
the cut-off switch.</i>

181
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,201
Please open the door!
Cooper!

182
00:15:09,368 --> 00:15:10,952
Seems to be workin' fine.

183
00:16:27,321 --> 00:16:29,239
I can see-e-e you-u-u.

184
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:33,784
<i>I can't believe how huge
and beautiful it is.</i>

185
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,456
That's what she said.

186
00:16:37,623 --> 00:16:39,540
This place is amazing.

187
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:42,919
<i>You wanna see something
even better?</i>

188
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:47,758
Why should I trust you
all of a sudden?

189
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:49,509
'Cause I'm all you got
tonight, babe.

190
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:57,142
<i>Go over your left
and exit through there.</i>

191
00:17:05,067 --> 00:17:07,568
<i>Then your right,
go down that corridor.</i>

192
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:23,353
They really spared
no expense.

193
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,409
And nobody will live here?

194
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:39,036
<i>They never finished it.</i>

195
00:18:51,256 --> 00:18:52,923
It's so dark in here.

196
00:18:59,681 --> 00:19:01,599
<i>Ugh! What is that smell?</i>

197
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:12,986
Ugh!

198
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:14,863
<i>First night,
you found an intruder.</i>

199
00:19:14,863 --> 00:19:16,698
Very promising, Ms. Streak.

200
00:19:19,326 --> 00:19:20,786
Jerk.

201
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:22,203
<i>This way.</i>

202
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:24,955
Hey, Cooper,
did you hear that?

203
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,415
<i>Hear what?</i>

204
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:31,880
Never mind.

205
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:44,476
Ah!

206
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:57,364
Complimentary
first night meal. Enjoy.

207
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:02,076
This looks like
hospital food.

208
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,788
You know why hospital food
tastes the way it does?

209
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:06,832
Why?

210
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:08,541
'Cause it makes you wanna
get out of the hospital.

211
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,627
Think about that.

212
00:20:11,795 --> 00:20:13,630
Uh, why are you
being so nice to me?

213
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:16,424
I'm not being nice.
That's company policy.

214
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,426
In a few hours your stomach's
gonna be grumbling

215
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:19,760
and you're gonna
wanna fall asleep.

216
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,637
You need that fuel.

217
00:20:29,938 --> 00:20:31,355
She's pretty.

218
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:38,195
- Is that your daughter?
- Yup.

219
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:40,073
- Are you guys close?
- Hey.

220
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:42,951
Enough.

221
00:20:56,464 --> 00:20:58,299
You know,
I have a daughter, too.

222
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:00,301
Good.

223
00:21:01,595 --> 00:21:03,387
Her name's Clara.

224
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:10,997
How come I can't get
441 on the screen?

225
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:13,165
Because there is no 441.

226
00:22:15,335 --> 00:22:18,046
It says 441 right here.

227
00:22:18,046 --> 00:22:20,006
They never got around
to finishing it

228
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:22,843
before they ran out of money.

229
00:22:22,843 --> 00:22:24,426
Where's the circuit breaker
for the cameras?

230
00:22:25,971 --> 00:22:28,138
I said there's no 441.

231
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:29,516
It doesn't matter
what the blueprint says.

232
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:30,808
If anyone should know, it's me.

233
00:22:30,808 --> 00:22:32,935
I've been here
since the beginning of time.

234
00:22:33,103 --> 00:22:35,020
Well, someone
should check it out.

235
00:22:37,065 --> 00:22:39,984
That's a good idea,
someone should do that.

236
00:22:39,984 --> 00:22:41,361
So why don't you go down there?

237
00:22:41,361 --> 00:22:42,863
Matter of fact, I'm telling you
to go down there

238
00:22:42,863 --> 00:22:45,115
and don't come back
until we have 441 on the grid.

239
00:22:46,991 --> 00:22:48,785
What are you waiting for?

240
00:22:51,746 --> 00:22:53,914
Fine, I will.

241
00:22:54,082 --> 00:22:55,584
Ah-ah.

242
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:13,894
4-4-1-4-3-7-8-5-2.

243
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:17,605
4-4-1-4-3-7-8-5-2.
4-4-1...

244
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:29,826
4-3-7...8-5-2.

245
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:31,827
Circuit breaker,
where are you?

246
00:23:32,746 --> 00:23:37,000
4-4-1-4-3-7-8-5-2.

247
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:51,096
4-4-1...

248
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:55,602
...4-3-7...

249
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:00,065
<i>...8-5-2.</i>

250
00:24:00,565 --> 00:24:02,275
8-5-2.

251
00:24:02,442 --> 00:24:03,902
8-5-2.

252
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:13,118
<i>You happy now?</i>

253
00:24:35,266 --> 00:24:36,643
Hello?

254
00:24:37,978 --> 00:24:39,895
Is someone there?

255
00:24:49,698 --> 00:24:51,950
Is somebody there?

256
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:54,326
<i>You talkin' to the walls now?
Is that what you're doin'?</i>

257
00:24:56,621 --> 00:24:58,373
<i>What are you doing?</i>

258
00:25:03,211 --> 00:25:04,461
Nothing.

259
00:25:31,239 --> 00:25:33,115
Keeping busy?

260
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:37,037
I heard something in there.

261
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:39,122
Yeah, what's that?

262
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:41,958
I don't know,
behind the door.

263
00:25:41,958 --> 00:25:44,961
There's nothing there,
I told you that.

264
00:25:44,961 --> 00:25:46,628
You knew about this,
didn't you?

265
00:25:49,132 --> 00:25:51,509
Why are there cameras down there
and why were they turned off?

266
00:25:51,509 --> 00:25:53,135
Because it's
an unfinished section

267
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:55,637
and they told us
not to go down there.

268
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:58,057
- There's something there.
- Impossible.

269
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:01,185
There.

270
00:26:01,352 --> 00:26:03,063
Can you see it?

271
00:26:05,065 --> 00:26:06,273
Oh, God!

272
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:12,821
I told you
something's not right.

273
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:16,116
No, we have company.

274
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:22,039
What does he want?

275
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:23,916
Probably wants shelter
for the night.

276
00:26:27,461 --> 00:26:28,962
What are we gonna
do about it?

277
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:30,423
Well, one of us is gonna
have to go down there

278
00:26:30,423 --> 00:26:33,050
and tell him to scram
before he breaks that window.

279
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:43,728
And I guess
that person will be me.

280
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:55,990
I didn't realize.

281
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:57,616
Save it.

282
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:09,420
I'm coming with you.

283
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:12,923
Oh, really? Now?

284
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:30,942
Sorry, buddy,
you gotta turn around.

285
00:27:30,942 --> 00:27:32,943
Please, man,
it's so cold out there.

286
00:27:32,943 --> 00:27:35,195
- I have no place to go.
- Can't do it.

287
00:27:35,363 --> 00:27:36,905
Come on, you have
all that space in there

288
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:40,117
and it just stands empty.
I just need one night inside!

289
00:27:40,285 --> 00:27:41,786
You gotta move on.
I told you.

290
00:27:41,786 --> 00:27:43,746
The storm's gonna get worse.
Find some place.

291
00:27:43,913 --> 00:27:47,208
Please, I'm begging you, man!
I'm begging ya!

292
00:27:47,375 --> 00:27:51,128
I... Honest, I mean no harm.
I— I— I— Honest to God.

293
00:27:51,128 --> 00:27:53,714
I just, just need
one night inside.

294
00:27:53,882 --> 00:27:56,092
I'll be gone before sunrise.
No one will know.

295
00:27:56,092 --> 00:27:57,969
Please, man, I'm begging ya!
I'm begging ya!

296
00:27:58,135 --> 00:28:01,138
It's not my call.
Sorry.

297
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:03,141
Move.
Streak, shut the door.

298
00:28:03,307 --> 00:28:05,894
Now! Shut it, Streak!

299
00:28:05,894 --> 00:28:07,353
Come on!

300
00:28:08,896 --> 00:28:11,106
Come on.
Hey, don't leave me here!

301
00:28:13,026 --> 00:28:15,819
Come on, have some compassion,
man, have a heart!

302
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:18,448
I'm gonna die out here tonight.

303
00:28:18,615 --> 00:28:21,284
I'm gonna die out here
while you're inside!

304
00:28:21,284 --> 00:28:24,494
And I hope you remember my face!

305
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:28,082
And I hope you think of me
before you go to bed at night!

306
00:28:28,082 --> 00:28:30,335
What's he gonna do?
He's an old man.

307
00:28:30,335 --> 00:28:32,795
We can't leave him like this.
Have a heart, Cooper.

308
00:28:34,255 --> 00:28:35,464
I said no.

309
00:28:41,721 --> 00:28:43,138
- Please!
- I'm letting him in.

310
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:44,932
- No, you're not.
- It's freezing out there.

311
00:28:44,932 --> 00:28:46,351
I'm not losing
my job for him.

312
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:49,019
You don't have to worry.

313
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:51,439
Thank you. Thank you so much.
Thank you.

314
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:03,534
Nice doggie.

315
00:29:03,534 --> 00:29:05,662
It's good now.

316
00:29:05,662 --> 00:29:06,871
Yeah.

317
00:29:07,747 --> 00:29:09,164
I gotta...

318
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:12,417
...thank you.

319
00:29:20,134 --> 00:29:23,512
You can stay here.
Oh, wow, yeah...

320
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,056
But you have to leave
before sunrise.

321
00:29:25,056 --> 00:29:27,724
Okay.

322
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:28,518
And don't go walking about.

323
00:29:28,726 --> 00:29:29,978
The entire building's
wired with cameras.

324
00:29:30,144 --> 00:29:31,813
We won't hesitate
to throw you out.

325
00:29:33,564 --> 00:29:35,942
- What's your name?
- Jim.

326
00:29:35,942 --> 00:29:39,403
Look, Jim, I don't know you

327
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:41,072
but I just put myself
out on a limb for you

328
00:29:41,072 --> 00:29:42,699
and I need to know
you're not gonna screw me over.

329
00:29:45,785 --> 00:29:48,203
Cross my heart.
What's your name?

330
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:51,790
Julia.

331
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,794
I'm sorry about
earlier today, Julia.

332
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:58,631
I'm a good person, really.

333
00:29:58,631 --> 00:30:00,508
I'm not a bad person.

334
00:30:02,343 --> 00:30:04,220
Prove it.

335
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,555
Okay.

336
00:30:13,563 --> 00:30:15,815
What's up, boy?

337
00:30:15,815 --> 00:30:18,026
What are you thinkin'?

338
00:30:18,026 --> 00:30:19,986
Huh?

339
00:30:19,986 --> 00:30:21,653
What are you thinkin'?

340
00:32:59,729 --> 00:33:01,605
Hello?

341
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:16,369
Is anyone there?

342
00:33:35,306 --> 00:33:36,932
What are you thinking, boy?

343
00:33:38,226 --> 00:33:40,810
Is it time? Hmm?

344
00:33:42,188 --> 00:33:44,941
Oh, yeah.

345
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:47,108
I think...

346
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:48,568
...it is-s-s.

347
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:50,028
Yeah.

348
00:33:54,616 --> 00:33:57,702
Let's see.
One, two, three.

349
00:33:58,621 --> 00:34:00,957
And dump it back in there.

350
00:34:01,999 --> 00:34:04,669
Let's see if we can do this.

351
00:34:04,835 --> 00:34:07,963
One, two...
Oh, the hell with it.

352
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:09,673
Mmm.

353
00:34:38,744 --> 00:34:40,621
Cooper, are you seeing this?

354
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:54,175
Cooper, are you there?

355
00:34:58,222 --> 00:34:59,889
Hello, Cooper?

356
00:35:07,481 --> 00:35:09,608
What are you saying, boy?

357
00:35:11,027 --> 00:35:14,070
Oh, you wanna go out for a walk.

358
00:35:16,907 --> 00:35:18,951
You heard the nice lady.

359
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:22,163
They'll throw us
back out into the storm!

360
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:24,581
Dumb dog.

361
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:28,918
Oh, we don't wanna do that.

362
00:35:31,505 --> 00:35:33,382
Do we?

363
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:08,876
Hello?

364
00:36:10,378 --> 00:36:12,003
Is anyone there?

365
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:37,862
Cooper, are you there?

366
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:55,338
I hear your plan, boy.

367
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:06,599
Yeah.

368
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:08,978
Yeah.

369
00:37:21,657 --> 00:37:23,617
What is this place?

370
00:38:13,626 --> 00:38:15,585
Hello?

371
00:38:16,545 --> 00:38:18,172
<i>This way.</i>

372
00:38:18,172 --> 00:38:19,798
Hello?

373
00:41:06,757 --> 00:41:09,425
<i>Streak, you okay?</i>

374
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:11,427
Where the hell were you?

375
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:13,972
<i>I was, uh,
taking care of some, uh...</i>

376
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:15,974
<i>...some manly duties.</i>

377
00:41:16,141 --> 00:41:17,476
<i>Where the hell
are you right now?</i>

378
00:41:17,643 --> 00:41:19,228
I'm in a shelter downstairs!

379
00:41:26,402 --> 00:41:28,737
Have you seen this place?

380
00:41:28,737 --> 00:41:30,947
It doesn't look like
anything to me.

381
00:41:31,114 --> 00:41:32,240
There's like
all these drawings!

382
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,909
It's like a dormitory
or something!

383
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:39,873
Did you know about this place?

384
00:41:40,958 --> 00:41:42,918
<i>I was told not to go
in there, so were you.</i>

385
00:41:45,963 --> 00:41:48,798
<i>Get back up here.</i>

386
00:41:48,798 --> 00:41:50,384
There's somebody
still living here, I know it.

387
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:55,764
Streak, did you shut
the shelter door behind you?

388
00:41:56,724 --> 00:41:58,057
No. Why?

389
00:41:58,057 --> 00:41:59,726
<i>Because somebody did.</i>

390
00:41:59,893 --> 00:42:03,230
<i>I told you not to let
that piece of shit in here.</i>

391
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:05,940
Oh, no, no!
Oh, no, no, no!

392
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:28,172
- It's not him.
- Oh, it's not? Really?

393
00:42:28,172 --> 00:42:29,922
<i>Who locked the door, the wind?</i>

394
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:31,800
Please just help me
find the exit.

395
00:42:35,721 --> 00:42:37,472
<i>Can you remember
how you came in?</i>

396
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:42,769
You can't tell me?!

397
00:42:42,769 --> 00:42:45,438
<i>There are no cameras there.
I told you that, remember?</i>

398
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:47,565
<i>I have no idea to
know where you are.</i>

399
00:42:48,275 --> 00:42:50,110
It's too dark in here to see!

400
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:54,489
<i>Hold still for a minute.</i>

401
00:42:54,489 --> 00:42:56,199
<i>And just relax.</i>

402
00:42:56,199 --> 00:42:57,951
<i>Can you see anything?</i>

403
00:43:04,875 --> 00:43:06,626
A light, an arch, a chair,

404
00:43:06,626 --> 00:43:08,128
something familiar
you remember on the way in.

405
00:43:16,052 --> 00:43:17,554
Everything looks the same.

406
00:43:22,309 --> 00:43:24,061
- What was that?
- What?

407
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:32,693
Cooper, what?

408
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:34,278
<i>Nothing.</i>

409
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:36,949
<i>I— I thought
that I saw something.</i>

410
00:43:36,949 --> 00:43:39,742
- Stop messing with me.
- I'm not messing with you.

411
00:43:39,909 --> 00:43:41,786
<i>Must have been
video interference here.</i>

412
00:43:41,786 --> 00:43:42,621
<i>It went black.</i>

413
00:43:42,788 --> 00:43:43,914
I'm in control of myself

414
00:43:43,914 --> 00:43:45,833
and I won't have my mind
play tricks on me.

415
00:43:45,833 --> 00:43:47,041
I'm in control of myself
and I won't have

416
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:48,418
my mind play tricks on me.

417
00:43:48,418 --> 00:43:49,920
I'm in control of myself
and I won't have

418
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,463
my mind play tricks on me..

419
00:43:55,425 --> 00:43:59,179
<i>Stop. Look. Go towards
the back and to the left.</i>

420
00:43:59,387 --> 00:44:00,304
<i>I think if you go that—</i>

421
00:44:00,514 --> 00:44:01,681
You're wrong.
I know where to go.

422
00:44:02,224 --> 00:44:03,224
What do you mean?

423
00:44:04,768 --> 00:44:06,394
I know where I am.

424
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:13,360
Streak.

425
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:16,572
Streak, listen to me.
I— I can't see you.

426
00:44:16,572 --> 00:44:18,197
If you can hear me,
don't move.

427
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:21,367
Stay right where you are.
Do not move. I'm coming down.

428
00:44:38,427 --> 00:44:40,304
<i>This way.</i>

429
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:13,795
What happened?

430
00:45:17,465 --> 00:45:19,927
You okay? You see?

431
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:22,304
That homeless piece of shit
that you let in locked you in.

432
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:27,309
- It wasn't him.
- Right.

433
00:45:27,476 --> 00:45:30,103
We're gonna find him right now.
We're gonna escort his ass out.

434
00:45:30,103 --> 00:45:32,063
He's gonna sleep tonight
in a puddle.

435
00:45:32,063 --> 00:45:34,523
There's something else
in there. It was not him.

436
00:45:34,733 --> 00:45:36,860
Something? What?

437
00:45:39,028 --> 00:45:40,697
Hundred bucks says
he left his room.

438
00:45:42,657 --> 00:45:44,284
Come on, let's go find out.

439
00:45:56,922 --> 00:45:58,382
Jim?

440
00:46:00,967 --> 00:46:02,469
He's not here.

441
00:46:02,635 --> 00:46:05,304
And that's why you keep
the scum outside, understand?

442
00:46:07,266 --> 00:46:08,724
Where you going?

443
00:46:08,934 --> 00:46:11,018
I'm gonna try to catch him,
save our jobs.

444
00:46:27,744 --> 00:46:30,414
Come on, boy.
Come on, boy.

445
00:46:31,831 --> 00:46:33,083
Come on.

446
00:46:33,083 --> 00:46:35,543
Take it easy, boy.

447
00:46:41,132 --> 00:46:43,135
Come on, boy.
Come on up.

448
00:46:43,135 --> 00:46:45,804
Come on, boy.
Come on, boy.

449
00:47:01,945 --> 00:47:03,405
Come on.

450
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:19,688
Boy?

451
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:21,900
Is that you?

452
00:48:23,985 --> 00:48:26,655
Oh... Boy?

453
00:48:28,907 --> 00:48:30,534
What the hell?

454
00:48:37,706 --> 00:48:41,043
What do you know? Yeah.

455
00:48:41,253 --> 00:48:42,545
Yeah!

456
00:49:01,731 --> 00:49:02,815
What the...

457
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:39,226
I can't breathe in this.

458
00:49:55,577 --> 00:49:57,161
I'm locking this place up.

459
00:49:59,581 --> 00:50:00,998
Well, I can't find
this scumbag anywhere

460
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:03,126
and that's unacceptable.

461
00:50:03,126 --> 00:50:04,585
Shit.

462
00:50:08,715 --> 00:50:10,550
Found it.

463
00:50:13,094 --> 00:50:15,387
<i>Wellville, a center
for physically deformed</i>

464
00:50:15,554 --> 00:50:17,641
<i>and mentally challenged
children.</i>

465
00:50:17,641 --> 00:50:19,266
<i>Last week,
I received a phone call</i>

466
00:50:19,476 --> 00:50:20,976
<i>from an anonymous source</i>

467
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:22,603
<i>complaining about
the treatment of the children</i>

468
00:50:22,603 --> 00:50:23,938
<i>hospitalized here.</i>

469
00:50:23,938 --> 00:50:26,858
<i>So I decided
to show up unannounced.</i>

470
00:50:26,858 --> 00:50:29,068
<i>And what you're about to see...</i>

471
00:50:29,068 --> 00:50:31,570
<i>...are some of the most
disturbing images...</i>

472
00:50:31,737 --> 00:50:34,324
<i>...this reporter
has ever witnessed.</i>

473
00:50:34,324 --> 00:50:36,451
<i>We were told to go
straight down to the basement</i>

474
00:50:36,451 --> 00:50:38,577
<i>where the institute holds
some of its youngest patients,</i>

475
00:50:38,577 --> 00:50:39,746
<i>many of them orphans.</i>

476
00:50:39,954 --> 00:50:41,831
<i>And what we found
was horrifying.</i>

477
00:50:58,181 --> 00:51:00,057
<i>Kids, some as young
as five years of age,</i>

478
00:51:00,266 --> 00:51:02,936
<i>left unattended for hours
in this grisly basement.</i>

479
00:51:10,527 --> 00:51:12,653
<i>We found one child
covered in his own feces</i>

480
00:51:12,653 --> 00:51:13,947
<i>sitting alone
on the bathroom floor.</i>

481
00:51:18,827 --> 00:51:21,663
- We don't need to watch this.
- Wait.

482
00:51:21,663 --> 00:51:24,123
<i>The man at the helm of this
institute, Dr. Thorndike,</i>

483
00:51:24,123 --> 00:51:25,541
<i>points the finger at the county.</i>

484
00:51:25,541 --> 00:51:27,168
<i>You have to understand</i>

485
00:51:27,168 --> 00:51:31,797
<i>nobody else
wants these children.</i>

486
00:51:31,965 --> 00:51:33,465
<i>Well, it doesn't seem
that you want them either.</i>

487
00:51:33,675 --> 00:51:36,135
<i>We're low on staff.
We're low on budget.</i>

488
00:51:36,135 --> 00:51:38,054
<i>Then how
do you respond</i>

489
00:51:38,054 --> 00:51:40,139
<i>to the allegations
of malpractice?</i>

490
00:51:40,139 --> 00:51:41,349
<i>It's preposterous.</i>

491
00:51:41,557 --> 00:51:42,851
<i>We have some of the best</i>

492
00:51:42,851 --> 00:51:44,268
<i>and most qualified physicians
in the country.</i>

493
00:51:44,268 --> 00:51:46,605
<i>Dr. Thorndike, is it true
that some of your patients</i>

494
00:51:46,605 --> 00:51:49,773
<i>have been victims of abuse
and neglect at this institute?</i>

495
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:52,693
<i>Alright, that's it.
We're done here.</i>

496
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:54,737
<i>And so we leave today,</i>

497
00:51:54,737 --> 00:51:55,989
<i>but the children
stay behind,</i>

498
00:51:56,197 --> 00:51:57,990
<i>unable to cry for help,</i>

499
00:51:57,990 --> 00:52:00,327
<i>so we must cry for them.</i>

500
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:02,661
<i>I'm Martin Rollins.
Back to you, Bob.</i>

501
00:52:13,882 --> 00:52:15,467
These poor kids.

502
00:52:17,677 --> 00:52:19,637
They probably
spent their life in there.

503
00:52:20,972 --> 00:52:22,931
I could sense it,
they're still there.

504
00:52:25,684 --> 00:52:27,853
He's the one
who locked you in.

505
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:30,856
You got confused and scared.
You're a very confused girl.

506
00:52:30,856 --> 00:52:34,235
- I'm telling you what I saw.
- Enough already. Enough!

507
00:52:36,237 --> 00:52:37,739
I know your problem.

508
00:52:37,947 --> 00:52:39,365
What are you talking about?

509
00:52:46,748 --> 00:52:49,958
- You went through my stuff?
- Yeah, I did.

510
00:52:49,958 --> 00:52:52,628
Because somehow something
wasn't just quite right tonight.

511
00:52:52,795 --> 00:52:54,630
Something didn't smell right.

512
00:52:54,797 --> 00:52:57,842
Because in all my years here,
one night shift with you

513
00:52:57,842 --> 00:53:00,302
has created more havoc
than anything I've ever seen.

514
00:53:04,224 --> 00:53:07,184
Did you not take your
three anti-psychotic pills

515
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:08,519
this evening?

516
00:53:08,686 --> 00:53:10,438
- That's none of your business.
- Oh, it is now.

517
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:17,403
Look, I'm not crazy.

518
00:53:21,282 --> 00:53:22,701
My whole life
I've been able to sense things

519
00:53:22,701 --> 00:53:24,536
that I can't describe.

520
00:53:24,536 --> 00:53:25,869
And when I told
the doctor about it

521
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:26,746
he put me on these pills,

522
00:53:26,746 --> 00:53:28,081
and if I don't take these pills

523
00:53:28,081 --> 00:53:29,541
then they're gonna
take Clara away.

524
00:53:29,708 --> 00:53:31,333
Your daughter Clara?

525
00:53:33,878 --> 00:53:35,547
You can't do this.

526
00:53:37,257 --> 00:53:39,300
This job is not for you.
This is not right for you.

527
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:41,052
This building at night—

528
00:53:41,052 --> 00:53:42,929
I'm not crazy.
I am not crazy, Cooper.

529
00:53:43,137 --> 00:53:45,639
I know what I saw.
Please, I am not crazy!

530
00:53:46,641 --> 00:53:47,976
Look.

531
00:53:47,976 --> 00:53:49,059
We gotta call him out of there

532
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:51,019
and then we've gotta
shut the door.

533
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:52,480
We can't let those kids out.

534
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,898
We've gotta
shut the door, Cooper.

535
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:57,860
Cooper, please, I'm begging you.
Please, we gotta shut the door.

536
00:53:59,487 --> 00:54:01,364
Because spirits can't travel
through doors?

537
00:54:01,364 --> 00:54:02,990
- Is that why?
- You don't understand.

538
00:54:02,990 --> 00:54:04,909
I have seen some things
down there, Cooper.

539
00:54:04,909 --> 00:54:07,704
I have seen things down there.
You're gonna sit down.

540
00:54:07,704 --> 00:54:08,996
- You're not going anywhere.
- Why not?

541
00:54:08,996 --> 00:54:11,123
Because you're delusional,
that's why.

542
00:54:11,291 --> 00:54:12,916
You've done enough tonight.

543
00:54:14,418 --> 00:54:16,588
- Cooper, I—
- I'm not letting you out of here.

544
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:17,963
Why?

545
00:54:18,172 --> 00:54:21,675
Because you're not
thinking right.

546
00:54:21,885 --> 00:54:23,010
Because you put me in jeopardy.

547
00:54:23,177 --> 00:54:25,889
Because I need this job.

548
00:54:25,889 --> 00:54:28,307
I don't have anywhere else
to go!

549
00:54:28,516 --> 00:54:30,768
You can take your pill
and go fool someone else

550
00:54:30,768 --> 00:54:32,186
like you fooled me!

551
00:54:32,186 --> 00:54:34,146
I can't.

552
00:54:34,355 --> 00:54:37,065
No pill... changes this.

553
00:54:37,525 --> 00:54:39,068
Do you understand?

554
00:54:42,905 --> 00:54:45,742
- I'm so sorry.
- Don't be.

555
00:54:45,742 --> 00:54:47,327
I don't need your pity.

556
00:54:56,251 --> 00:54:58,963
Are you fucking kidding me?

557
00:54:58,963 --> 00:55:01,800
They won't leave us alone
unless we shut the door, Cooper.

558
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:03,802
Or what,
you're gonna stun me?

559
00:55:05,094 --> 00:55:07,679
- I'm gonna do it.
- Put it down.

560
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:09,974
You're not gonna do it.

561
00:55:09,974 --> 00:55:11,434
No, you're not,
because it's just gonna prove

562
00:55:11,643 --> 00:55:13,978
that you're crazy and you're
gonna lose everything.

563
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:17,981
Please, Cooper,
I'm begging you. Please.

564
00:55:21,693 --> 00:55:22,862
I'll go down.

565
00:55:24,322 --> 00:55:26,615
I'll go down
and I'll shut the door.

566
00:55:27,492 --> 00:55:28,492
Okay?

567
00:55:30,202 --> 00:55:31,411
Okay?

568
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:36,458
Okay?

569
00:55:36,626 --> 00:55:39,003
See? That's better.

570
00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:44,132
What are you doing?
Cooper?

571
00:55:44,132 --> 00:55:46,385
Cooper, no! Don't leave me
like this, please!

572
00:55:46,594 --> 00:55:47,971
I'm not taking any chances.

573
00:55:47,971 --> 00:55:50,389
I can't trust you anymore.

574
00:55:50,556 --> 00:55:51,807
Please hurry, Cooper!

575
00:55:51,974 --> 00:55:53,601
Please, I...
Don't leave me alone!

576
00:55:54,726 --> 00:55:55,853
Cooper.

577
00:55:55,853 --> 00:55:57,896
What?

578
00:55:57,896 --> 00:55:59,523
Don't take the elevator.

579
00:56:02,443 --> 00:56:03,485
Seriously?

580
00:56:47,739 --> 00:56:50,074
Oh, come on.

581
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,409
Streak, did you
touch anything up there?

582
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:54,244
<i>I'm not doing anything.</i>

583
00:56:58,123 --> 00:57:00,001
Goddamn generator.

584
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:03,880
It's not the generator.

585
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:08,134
<i>Maybe we should call someone.</i>

586
00:57:08,342 --> 00:57:09,135
That's a good idea.

587
00:57:09,302 --> 00:57:11,387
That way we can both be fired
and thrown out in the storm

588
00:57:11,596 --> 00:57:13,806
with the homeless piece of shit
that you let in here.

589
00:57:16,059 --> 00:57:17,601
Maybe you can tell 'em
your ghost stories,

590
00:57:17,809 --> 00:57:19,771
that'll amuse 'em.

591
00:57:19,771 --> 00:57:20,938
I'm gonna try
to pry this thing open

592
00:57:20,938 --> 00:57:22,815
and get to the breaker.

593
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:34,327
Don't do it.
It's not safe.

594
00:57:52,052 --> 00:57:53,846
Cooper, it's closing.

595
00:57:53,846 --> 00:57:55,181
<i>Watch out!</i>

596
00:58:00,686 --> 00:58:01,646
Cooper!

597
00:58:48,985 --> 00:58:50,652
Cooper, are you okay?

598
00:58:51,987 --> 00:58:53,905
Yeah, I'm alright.

599
00:59:07,461 --> 00:59:09,505
You know, there's only
one thing I wanna know

600
00:59:09,505 --> 00:59:10,882
that I don't understand.

601
00:59:10,882 --> 00:59:12,382
<i>What's that?</i>

602
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:14,844
When you were down
in that shelter

603
00:59:14,844 --> 00:59:17,679
how did you know
where the entrance was?

604
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:19,222
How did you know
which way to go?

605
00:59:21,559 --> 00:59:23,143
I don't know.

606
00:59:30,318 --> 00:59:32,110
- Did you hear that?
- Hear what?

607
00:59:34,947 --> 00:59:36,407
Oh my God.

608
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:45,123
Cooper, you gotta
get out of there.

609
00:59:57,135 --> 00:59:58,846
Well, can you see something?

610
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:17,239
What did you see?

611
01:00:19,407 --> 01:00:21,284
The kids.

612
01:00:23,246 --> 01:00:25,123
They're out.

613
01:00:36,717 --> 01:00:38,427
<i>Cooper, can you hear me?</i>

614
01:00:38,427 --> 01:00:41,139
There's no such thing
as ghosts.

615
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:43,181
All your mumbo-jumbo
is getting in my head.

616
01:00:43,349 --> 01:00:44,349
Just had a few drinks.

617
01:00:45,559 --> 01:00:46,561
Wait.

618
01:00:56,903 --> 01:00:58,072
Yeah.

619
01:01:07,331 --> 01:01:09,166
Well, let's get this over with.

620
01:01:19,802 --> 01:01:20,802
<i>In here.</i>

621
01:01:23,681 --> 01:01:25,266
I can hear the dog.

622
01:01:26,474 --> 01:01:27,684
<i>Hey, boy.</i>

623
01:01:35,025 --> 01:01:37,402
Come on out now.

624
01:01:37,402 --> 01:01:39,697
Come on, boy.
Come here now.

625
01:01:39,864 --> 01:01:41,282
Goddammit.

626
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:49,248
I'm not going in there.

627
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:52,835
Hey!

628
01:01:53,793 --> 01:01:56,213
If you're in there...

629
01:01:56,213 --> 01:01:58,215
...it's your last chance.

630
01:01:58,382 --> 01:02:00,259
I'm shutting this door.

631
01:02:16,817 --> 01:02:19,862
- Close the door!
- What's going on?

632
01:02:23,199 --> 01:02:24,824
What's going on?

633
01:02:29,079 --> 01:02:30,789
What's going on?

634
01:02:30,956 --> 01:02:32,666
Ow!

635
01:02:32,875 --> 01:02:34,710
What are you doing?
Don't go in there!

636
01:02:43,677 --> 01:02:45,262
I can't control it.

637
01:02:46,972 --> 01:02:48,599
- Cooper, no!
- I can't stop!

638
01:02:50,976 --> 01:02:52,103
No!

639
01:02:52,103 --> 01:02:54,105
Cooper, can you hear me?

640
01:02:55,856 --> 01:02:58,025
No, no, no.

641
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:06,157
Oh, come on,
come on, please.

642
01:03:16,043 --> 01:03:17,585
Come on!

643
01:03:19,963 --> 01:03:21,340
Come on! Please, please.

644
01:03:26,804 --> 01:03:29,472
Open. Please open.
Please, please, please.

645
01:05:38,686 --> 01:05:40,353
Who's that?

646
01:05:42,021 --> 01:05:43,983
Hello?

647
01:05:43,983 --> 01:05:45,650
<i>Are you one
of the grown-ups?</i>

648
01:06:39,246 --> 01:06:40,998
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

649
01:07:01,726 --> 01:07:03,561
Cooper, can you hear me?

650
01:07:06,731 --> 01:07:09,108
Hi, boy! You're a good boy!
You're gonna help me!

651
01:07:09,318 --> 01:07:11,362
You're gonna show me
where he is, right?

652
01:07:14,239 --> 01:07:15,949
Come on, come on.

653
01:07:16,784 --> 01:07:18,827
Go! Go!

654
01:07:18,994 --> 01:07:21,121
Come on, let's go!

655
01:07:47,188 --> 01:07:48,856
Cooper, are you there?

656
01:07:57,282 --> 01:07:58,409
Cooper.

657
01:08:01,704 --> 01:08:02,871
Cooper.

658
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:10,420
Cooper?

659
01:08:18,679 --> 01:08:21,347
Cooper, can you hear me?
Cooper?

660
01:08:21,347 --> 01:08:22,600
Cooper?

661
01:08:29,856 --> 01:08:31,149
No!

662
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:35,738
Oh, please!

663
01:08:35,904 --> 01:08:38,657
Please don't do this to me!
Please!

664
01:08:49,167 --> 01:08:50,793
<i>Julia?</i>

665
01:09:07,935 --> 01:09:10,396
They're never gonna
let you leave.

666
01:09:14,984 --> 01:09:17,029
Who are they?

667
01:09:17,237 --> 01:09:18,947
My friends.

668
01:09:20,573 --> 01:09:22,909
Why? Why would they
do this to me?

669
01:09:24,578 --> 01:09:26,622
They don't like grown-ups.

670
01:09:28,748 --> 01:09:30,917
Is it because of this place?

671
01:09:35,046 --> 01:09:36,798
Do you want me to show you?

672
01:11:13,228 --> 01:11:15,564
Some of us tried to run away.

673
01:12:01,734 --> 01:12:03,319
Where are they taking them?

674
01:12:35,519 --> 01:12:39,021
The grown-ups lock them
in here to keep them quiet.

675
01:12:41,233 --> 01:12:43,652
They drank the bad water.

676
01:12:49,533 --> 01:12:52,118
When the grown-ups arrived,
it was too late.

677
01:13:05,465 --> 01:13:07,384
They all died?

678
01:13:07,759 --> 01:13:09,720
Except for one.

679
01:13:12,639 --> 01:13:15,809
Mama! Mama!

680
01:13:15,975 --> 01:13:17,394
Mama!

681
01:13:20,898 --> 01:13:22,274
Clara!

682
01:13:22,858 --> 01:13:26,569
- No!
- No! No!

683
01:13:26,569 --> 01:13:27,820
No, my baby!

684
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:29,698
Don't do it!

685
01:13:30,657 --> 01:13:32,909
It's not her.

686
01:13:37,788 --> 01:13:39,041
No!

687
01:14:55,283 --> 01:14:57,411
We gotta get outta here!

688
01:14:57,411 --> 01:14:58,996
- Let's go, Cooper!
- Ah!

689
01:14:59,162 --> 01:15:00,579
No! Cooper!

690
01:15:00,579 --> 01:15:02,498
Cooper, no! No! No!

691
01:15:02,498 --> 01:15:05,292
No, Cooper!
Don't let go! No! No!

692
01:15:05,292 --> 01:15:06,377
Go!

693
01:15:06,377 --> 01:15:08,046
Cooper! Cooper!

694
01:15:08,046 --> 01:15:10,256
- Don't let go!
- Go!

695
01:15:10,256 --> 01:15:12,216
Go! Get...

696
01:15:12,216 --> 01:15:15,095
Cooper! No!

697
01:15:15,095 --> 01:15:17,680
Cooper!

698
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:19,557
No!

699
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:24,813
No! No!

700
01:16:48,771 --> 01:16:51,942
No! Please, let me out!
Please!

701
01:16:53,109 --> 01:16:56,029
Please let me out!
Please! Please!

702
01:16:57,988 --> 01:17:00,617
Please, let me out.

703
01:17:04,162 --> 01:17:07,289
Let me out! Please!

704
01:17:08,958 --> 01:17:10,836
Please let me out.

705
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:20,177
Please let me out.
Please. Please.

706
01:17:28,811 --> 01:17:31,314
What... What do you...
What do you want?

707
01:17:56,131 --> 01:17:58,007
Let me see.

708
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:11,688
It's not your fault.

709
01:18:16,193 --> 01:18:18,235
It's not your fault.

710
01:18:32,958 --> 01:18:35,337
It's not your fault.

711
01:18:38,547 --> 01:18:42,176
I love you
just the way you are.

712
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:51,936
I'm gonna go now, okay?

713
01:18:56,983 --> 01:18:58,025
Okay?

714
01:18:59,694 --> 01:19:00,694
Okay.

715
01:20:04,341 --> 01:20:06,970
<i>This patient's been
with us since she was a child.</i>

716
01:20:08,179 --> 01:20:10,055
<i>Stuck in a coma.</i>

717
01:20:11,265 --> 01:20:13,475
Time of death, 8:34.

718
01:20:17,771 --> 01:20:20,024
I'm sorry for your loss,
Mr. Streak.

719
01:20:26,030 --> 01:20:28,283
I'd like a moment
with my daughter.

720
01:20:28,992 --> 01:20:30,368
Of course.

721
01:20:31,453 --> 01:20:33,078
Take all the time you need.

722
01:20:34,872 --> 01:20:36,707
Follow me, please.
