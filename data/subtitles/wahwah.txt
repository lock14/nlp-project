1
00:04:07,596 --> 00:04:09,764
Ralph.

2
00:04:09,848 --> 00:04:12,309
You've got three minutes.

3
00:04:12,392 --> 00:04:14,436
Coming.

4
00:04:15,645 --> 00:04:17,439
Ralph.

5
00:04:17,522 --> 00:04:19,274
Coming.

6
00:04:19,357 --> 00:04:21,401
Don't run.

7
00:04:29,826 --> 00:04:31,870
Where's your father?

8
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,417
Cat got your tongue?
What's the matter with you?

9
00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:41,963
Regina, no lunch, thank you.
We're eating at Government House.

10
00:04:42,047 --> 00:04:44,090
Thank you, madam.

11
00:04:45,383 --> 00:04:48,970
- You scrubbed up well, Popeye.
- Don't call me that, Dad.

12
00:04:49,054 --> 00:04:51,306
- Especially not in public.
- Of course I won't.

13
00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:52,807
- Popeye.
- Dad!

14
00:04:52,891 --> 00:04:56,102
- Ask your father for the car keys.
- They're in her handbag.

15
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:01,691
You might just make an effort.
Just this once, on this one occasion.

16
00:05:01,775 --> 00:05:04,611
I suppose that would be asking
just a little too much.

17
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,407
Take no notice. Let's go, Popeye.

18
00:05:12,869 --> 00:05:15,330
- Sauwubona, Mrs Compton.
- Dozen.

19
00:05:17,832 --> 00:05:20,293
- Sauwubona, Dozen.
- Sauwubona, Mr Compton.

20
00:05:23,171 --> 00:05:25,006
Siyabonga, Dozen.

21
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:46,444
May I open my window, please?

22
00:05:47,654 --> 00:05:50,115
My hair will get ruined.

23
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:59,791
To our trusty and well-beloved
Harry Childs Compton,

24
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:06,089
for 22 years of exemplary service
for education here in Swaziland.

25
00:06:15,056 --> 00:06:19,394
This tenth day of June, 1969,

26
00:06:19,477 --> 00:06:23,857
in the 18th year of our reign,
by the Sovereign's command,

27
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,984
Elizabeth II.

28
00:06:28,778 --> 00:06:31,114
- Well done, Dad.
- Thank you, Popeye.

29
00:06:38,205 --> 00:06:40,415
- Well done, old bean.
- Thank you, Charles.

30
00:06:40,498 --> 00:06:42,918
- Congratulations, lumpkin.
- Hear, hear.

31
00:06:43,001 --> 00:06:45,128
- Welcome to the club.
- Oh, thank you.

32
00:06:45,212 --> 00:06:47,255
You're looking ravishing, June.

33
00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:49,382
- Am I really?
- Oh, yes, you are.

34
00:06:49,466 --> 00:06:52,469
- Gwennie, I didn't see you there.
- Don't mind me.

35
00:06:52,552 --> 00:06:55,222
Huge congratulations, Harry.

36
00:06:55,305 --> 00:06:57,599
- Thank you, Gwennie.
- So proud of you.

37
00:06:57,682 --> 00:07:01,728
- Congratulations, Harry.
- You've got some bloody front, Traherne.

38
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,903
- You must be ever so proud...
- Bugger off.

39
00:07:13,823 --> 00:07:16,910
- Would anybody like a cigarette?
- Thank you, Gwennie.

40
00:07:25,502 --> 00:07:27,212
Is this some new game?

41
00:07:29,047 --> 00:07:30,882
Am I missing something?

42
00:07:30,966 --> 00:07:33,009
- What's up?
- Why don't you ask him?

43
00:07:37,597 --> 00:07:39,641
Nine months.

44
00:07:40,851 --> 00:07:43,770
Nine months. No speaks.

45
00:07:43,854 --> 00:07:49,150
Go on. I dare you. Just once,
break your epic bloody sulk.

46
00:07:49,234 --> 00:07:52,362
Answer me this.
Where were you last night?

47
00:07:54,155 --> 00:07:56,616
We all left the club at the same time.

48
00:07:59,411 --> 00:08:01,454
Another flat tyre?

49
00:08:06,084 --> 00:08:07,961
Do you think he doesn't know?

50
00:08:19,055 --> 00:08:23,018
Regina, you can remove
all these silly cards now, thank you.

51
00:08:25,061 --> 00:08:26,354
Yes, sir.

52
00:08:29,107 --> 00:08:32,736
How dare you contradict me
in front of a servant?

53
00:08:32,819 --> 00:08:35,572
The Sphinx has spoken.

54
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:39,659
What's a gong, Dad?

55
00:08:39,743 --> 00:08:42,579
That stupid piece of metal bird shit
they gave your father.

56
00:08:42,662 --> 00:08:44,539
Take no notice.

57
00:08:44,623 --> 00:08:46,666
Ask your mother to pass the salt.

58
00:08:59,971 --> 00:09:02,182
Why is Daddy's medal stupid?

59
00:09:03,517 --> 00:09:07,854
Because all those idiots, dressed up
like bloody vanilla ice creams,

60
00:09:07,938 --> 00:09:14,194
think that it's a suitable reward
for enduring a lifetime of boredom

61
00:09:14,277 --> 00:09:18,823
out here in this...
middle of bloody nowhere, that's why!

62
00:09:20,367 --> 00:09:22,202
If anyone deserves a medal, it's me.

63
00:09:23,203 --> 00:09:26,623
- I need another drink.
- I bet you do.

64
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:32,504
You're pathetic. Pathetic.

65
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,131
Always have been, always will be.

66
00:09:35,215 --> 00:09:40,887
Why is this house stuffed to the
gunwales with cards and telegrams?

67
00:09:40,971 --> 00:09:44,724
Toadying arselickers, the lot of them!

68
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:17,674
Wake up, darling.

69
00:10:18,592 --> 00:10:19,759
Ralphie.

70
00:10:20,302 --> 00:10:21,928
What?

71
00:10:22,012 --> 00:10:24,306
This is the hardest thing
I've ever had to say.

72
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:26,892
There is no easy way to say this but...

73
00:10:26,975 --> 00:10:29,352
Darling, Mummy's leaving.

74
00:10:29,436 --> 00:10:31,479
How do you mean?

75
00:10:34,107 --> 00:10:37,319
You won't have to go to school today.

76
00:10:37,402 --> 00:10:41,072
It's just that I can't carry on
any more like this.

77
00:10:41,698 --> 00:10:44,993
But I love you very, very much. Bye, angel.

78
00:10:45,076 --> 00:10:48,121
- Please don't go. I beg of you.
- I must.

79
00:10:48,205 --> 00:10:51,082
Then take me with you. Please.

80
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:54,127
I can't.

81
00:11:04,429 --> 00:11:06,264
I'll call you.

82
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,244
Dad.

83
00:12:09,744 --> 00:12:11,580
When's she coming back?

84
00:12:12,706 --> 00:12:14,749
I don't know, Popeye.

85
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,004
A long time or a little time?

86
00:12:20,463 --> 00:12:23,049
Maybe a long time.

87
00:12:23,842 --> 00:12:26,219
Maybe never?

88
00:12:26,303 --> 00:12:28,096
Maybe.

89
00:12:29,389 --> 00:12:32,350
- Doesn't she love me any more?
- Of course she does.

90
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:36,229
Then how could she leave?

91
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:00,754
She's very well, thank you.

92
00:13:01,922 --> 00:13:03,965
This is Mr Compton.

93
00:13:05,383 --> 00:13:07,886
- Morning, sir.
- Good morning, class.

94
00:13:07,969 --> 00:13:09,721
You may sit down, thank you.

95
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:18,647
All right, let's see.

96
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,444
Very good.

97
00:13:25,654 --> 00:13:27,697
Excellent. Very difficult one.

98
00:13:28,573 --> 00:13:30,617
Yes?

99
00:13:31,993 --> 00:13:34,412
I'm begging you. Lauren, please.

100
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:40,377
Just give me a chance.
Is that too much to bloody ask?

101
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,504
It'ss over.

102
00:13:42,587 --> 00:13:44,631
I'sm never coming back.

103
00:13:45,632 --> 00:13:47,676
Where'ss Ralph?

104
00:13:50,387 --> 00:13:52,639
He's right here.

105
00:13:52,722 --> 00:13:54,766
You ask her, Popeye.

106
00:13:59,896 --> 00:14:01,731
Are you there already?

107
00:14:01,815 --> 00:14:03,859
Just got here, darling.

108
00:14:04,734 --> 00:14:07,195
When are you coming home?

109
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,699
I can't. Not for a while.

110
00:14:10,782 --> 00:14:14,828
But I'll eat all my vegetables, I promise.

111
00:14:14,911 --> 00:14:17,455
Please, Mummy.

112
00:14:17,539 --> 00:14:19,916
I beg of you. Please.

113
00:14:20,709 --> 00:14:23,753
It'sll be much better once
you'sre settled at boarding school.

114
00:14:23,837 --> 00:14:26,423
I love you. I have to go.

115
00:14:26,506 --> 00:14:28,550
Bye-bye, Ralphie.

116
00:14:44,816 --> 00:14:48,486
Thank you, Lord, for the love you give.
Thank you, Lord, for the life we live.

117
00:14:49,613 --> 00:14:54,326
Please make my mummy come back again
and fix our broken family.

118
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:57,037
Amen.

119
00:15:12,427 --> 00:15:14,429
Please, wake up.

120
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:19,226
Please don't be dead.

121
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,983
Don't worry, Dad.

122
00:15:27,859 --> 00:15:29,903
It'll be all right.

123
00:15:34,241 --> 00:15:36,284
It'll be all right, Dad.

124
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:54,219
- Good morning, class.
- Good morning, Mr Parker.

125
00:15:57,722 --> 00:16:00,433
Stand up. Yes, you two.

126
00:16:02,644 --> 00:16:04,688
Read it out loud and clear.

127
00:16:06,982 --> 00:16:08,900
Chop, chop, Compton.
We're all waiting.

128
00:16:11,528 --> 00:16:13,697
Speak up. We haven't got all day.

129
00:16:16,449 --> 00:16:19,494
- "Where's your mum?"
- Meaning?

130
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:21,872
- Nothing, sir.
- Clare?

131
00:16:21,955 --> 00:16:25,500
- His mother's adulterated, sir.
- Bugger you.

132
00:16:26,793 --> 00:16:29,212
Come back in here, young man. Be quiet.

133
00:16:32,757 --> 00:16:33,967
Bugger you.

134
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:37,512
No, bugger you. Bugger you both.

135
00:16:39,681 --> 00:16:41,725
Can I come in?

136
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:46,605
This is marvellous. Absolutely marvellous.

137
00:16:46,688 --> 00:16:48,857
How did you make it?

138
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:51,234
Just out of an old shoebox and lollipop sticks.

139
00:16:51,318 --> 00:16:54,946
It's very, very clever. Show me how it works.

140
00:16:57,324 --> 00:16:59,284
What happened at school today, Popeye?

141
00:16:59,367 --> 00:17:02,412
I'm not cross. I just want to know, that's all.

142
00:17:02,495 --> 00:17:04,372
Mummy ran away too.

143
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:07,209
That's different. She fell out of love with me.

144
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:10,795
- Why did she leave me?
- One day you'll understand.

145
00:17:10,879 --> 00:17:14,007
- When you're older.
- But you don't understand.

146
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:15,425
And you are older.

147
00:17:16,843 --> 00:17:19,930
That is very true, smarty-pants.

148
00:17:20,347 --> 00:17:22,724
Hello.

149
00:17:22,807 --> 00:17:24,476
Cooee.

150
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,103
Why does she have to come round all the time?

151
00:17:27,187 --> 00:17:28,897
Auntie Gwen's very upset.

152
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:32,943
Mummy went away with her husband.
We're going to be very nice to her.

153
00:17:37,155 --> 00:17:38,740
Anybody in?

154
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:48,375
You gave me the fright of my life, you two did.

155
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:51,711
Come here and give your Auntie Gwen
a nice big kiss.

156
00:17:55,382 --> 00:17:58,051
- Hello, Gwennie.
- Hello, Harry.

157
00:17:58,134 --> 00:18:01,388
- Would you like a drink?
- I could murder something soft.

158
00:18:01,471 --> 00:18:04,933
With maybe just a teensy-weensy
little squidge of whisky.

159
00:18:05,016 --> 00:18:08,353
- How are you, Harry?
- You know, Gwennie, bearing up.

160
00:18:10,564 --> 00:18:13,316
- And you?
- Don't ask.

161
00:18:14,818 --> 00:18:17,571
I've cooked you boys a homemade curry.

162
00:18:17,654 --> 00:18:19,948
You shouldn't have, really, Gwennie.

163
00:18:22,742 --> 00:18:24,494
It's a pleasure.

164
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:29,332
Thanks, angel.
Just what the doctor ordered.

165
00:18:31,334 --> 00:18:34,129
- Cheers, boys.
- This is not too stiff for you?

166
00:18:34,212 --> 00:18:36,840
- No.
- How's your sunstroke?

167
00:18:36,923 --> 00:18:40,135
- I beg yours?
- Mummy said you had sunstroke.

168
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:45,307
She said it made you speak slurry
and walk all wobbly.

169
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:48,518
- Is she back, then?
- No. He's just pulling your leg.

170
00:18:48,602 --> 00:18:52,147
- Aren't you, Popeye? Relax, Gwen.
- Evening, chaps.

171
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:54,274
- June.
- Don't get up.

172
00:18:56,484 --> 00:18:58,528
- Good to see you.
- Hello, Gwennie.

173
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,283
I spy with my little eye
someone who's beaten me to it.

174
00:19:03,825 --> 00:19:06,411
- One of your curries?
- Yeah.

175
00:19:08,538 --> 00:19:11,166
Family allergy
to all things curried after India.

176
00:19:11,249 --> 00:19:13,335
Can't stomach the stuff.

177
00:19:16,296 --> 00:19:18,131
Where's your husband?

178
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:23,094
Not him too? What, gone?

179
00:19:23,178 --> 00:19:26,890
- Can't keep up.
- Yes, I'm afraid so, June.

180
00:19:26,973 --> 00:19:29,768
- You poor thing. Have a hanky.
- Thank you.

181
00:19:29,851 --> 00:19:32,854
Lauren's not skedaddled back yet,
has she, Ralphie?

182
00:19:34,105 --> 00:19:36,149
Well, at least I got that right.

183
00:19:36,233 --> 00:19:39,861
Now, I've baked you chaps a Dundee.

184
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:47,369
- Can't stay. Must trot.
- So sweet of you.

185
00:19:48,745 --> 00:19:50,789
Ta-ta.

186
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:56,002
I'll kill that bitch!

187
00:20:05,512 --> 00:20:07,556
Harry Compton.

188
00:20:09,099 --> 00:20:12,519
I love you. I do, you know.

189
00:20:12,602 --> 00:20:14,646
I really do.

190
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:21,862
I've come to say good night.

191
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:28,577
Come and give your Auntie Gwen
a good-night ki...

192
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,704
Are you all right, old girl?

193
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:33,498
- I'm fine.
- You're not my aunt.

194
00:20:33,582 --> 00:20:36,334
Steady on, Ralphie.
What's gotten into you, old boy?

195
00:20:39,588 --> 00:20:41,173
Come here.

196
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:45,760
- Leave me alone.
- I know this is hard, Popeye.

197
00:20:47,345 --> 00:20:51,641
- Gwen's on our side, remember?
- Only cos she's in love with you.

198
00:20:51,725 --> 00:20:55,187
- Don't be daft.
- It's true.

199
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:59,399
Mummy stole her husband
and now she wants you. It's obvious.

200
00:20:59,482 --> 00:21:01,526
And Auntie June is after you, too.

201
00:21:02,569 --> 00:21:06,406
Nonsense, we're all just a little upset, that's all.

202
00:21:06,489 --> 00:21:07,991
Then why are you laughing?

203
00:21:08,074 --> 00:21:12,078
Because I am not going to get remarried.

204
00:21:12,162 --> 00:21:14,915
- God, your breath stinks.
- Enough backchat from you.

205
00:21:14,998 --> 00:21:17,042
Now, go to sleep.

206
00:21:21,129 --> 00:21:23,173
Good night.

207
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:27,928
- Morning.
- Morning, Gwennie.

208
00:21:28,011 --> 00:21:30,805
- Good morning, all.
- Forgotten all your manners?

209
00:21:32,265 --> 00:21:36,645
Regina, could you bring an extra cup
and plate for Mrs Traherne. Tea?

210
00:21:36,728 --> 00:21:40,106
Lovely. I'm sorry about last night, Ralphie.

211
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:43,026
- It was a touch of my sunstroke.
- What did I tell you?

212
00:21:43,985 --> 00:21:47,781
- I slept on the couch, you know.
- Does madam eat the kipper?

213
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,621
It might be better if I did go to a boarding school.

214
00:21:54,704 --> 00:21:57,624
- Like Mummy wanted.
- Done.

215
00:21:57,707 --> 00:22:02,420
Ralphie, I didn't mean that, Popeye.
You can't go. I'd be all alone.

216
00:22:02,504 --> 00:22:04,965
Doesn't look like it.

217
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:53,346
I won't ever let you down, Popeye.

218
00:22:56,224 --> 00:22:58,268
I'll miss you so much.

219
00:23:05,025 --> 00:23:06,985
All right. Go. Go on.

220
00:25:11,067 --> 00:25:12,694
What happened?

221
00:25:13,612 --> 00:25:15,655
I'm so sorry I'm late.

222
00:25:20,327 --> 00:25:22,704
Flat tyre. How old are you?

223
00:25:22,787 --> 00:25:25,373
I can't remember.

224
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:27,876
Neither can I.

225
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:30,003
- You look different.
- Yes, I've...

226
00:25:31,505 --> 00:25:33,798
- I've got remarried.
- You've what?

227
00:25:36,801 --> 00:25:39,679
- Who? Auntie Gwen?
- No, you daft fool.

228
00:25:39,763 --> 00:25:41,806
She's American.

229
00:25:45,685 --> 00:25:47,562
- How long have you known her?
- Six weeks.

230
00:25:47,646 --> 00:25:48,855
Fuck.

231
00:26:12,379 --> 00:26:14,256
You're a very big boy now.

232
00:26:22,973 --> 00:26:24,432
Hi, Ralph.

233
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:27,727
- I'm Ruby. Hi, honey.
- And I'm Neil Armstrong.

234
00:26:27,811 --> 00:26:34,025
You are funny. God, look at you.
You are so handsome too.

235
00:26:35,193 --> 00:26:37,237
Fix me a drink, please, hon.

236
00:26:39,614 --> 00:26:41,408
- How do you do?
- Just fabulously.

237
00:26:41,491 --> 00:26:45,120
I've heard so much about you.
I was getting worried about you guys.

238
00:26:45,203 --> 00:26:47,289
- What happened, honey?
- Flat tyre, darling.

239
00:26:47,372 --> 00:26:49,207
Really, again? God.

240
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:53,712
You must be starving.
First thing I'm gonna do is feed you up a little.

241
00:26:53,795 --> 00:26:55,463
You eat pasta?

242
00:26:55,881 --> 00:26:57,174
What happened here?

243
00:26:57,257 --> 00:27:00,343
- You like it? I just love it.
- Here you go, darling.

244
00:27:00,427 --> 00:27:03,430
- Bottoms up.
- Isn't she just gorgeous?

245
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:07,309
- Excuse me, please.
- You go right ahead.

246
00:27:11,188 --> 00:27:14,232
Everything OK?
I got a gift to welcome you home.

247
00:27:14,316 --> 00:27:16,776
- You wanna open it?
- Thank you.

248
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:19,404
- I'd rather not just yet, thanks.
- Take your time.

249
00:27:19,487 --> 00:27:21,656
Don't worry, this is weird for me too.

250
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:25,660
Please don't call me Mom.
Just Ruby, or Rube, whatever.

251
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,083
All right, Popeye?

252
00:27:41,801 --> 00:27:43,845
Puppets.

253
00:28:12,499 --> 00:28:14,543
Listen.

254
00:28:15,961 --> 00:28:18,922
I'm sorry you've chosen to take it this way.

255
00:28:19,005 --> 00:28:21,383
I didn't have any choice, did I?

256
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:23,844
But what was I supposed to have done?

257
00:28:23,927 --> 00:28:26,304
You could've warned me.

258
00:28:26,388 --> 00:28:28,890
Ruby's wonderful. You'll see.

259
00:28:29,891 --> 00:28:31,935
Just give it time.

260
00:28:33,103 --> 00:28:35,146
You mean like you did?

261
00:28:36,106 --> 00:28:38,650
What?

262
00:28:38,733 --> 00:28:41,903
- Nothing.
- No, no, you said something.

263
00:28:41,987 --> 00:28:44,030
Spit it out.

264
00:28:47,325 --> 00:28:49,369
She's not my mum.

265
00:28:50,203 --> 00:28:51,872
True.

266
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:54,875
Yes, run!

267
00:28:57,961 --> 00:29:01,256
- When's your mum coming down?
- What do you think?

268
00:29:01,339 --> 00:29:03,466
- It's been two years.
- Bloody hell.

269
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:04,634
Shush!

270
00:29:05,969 --> 00:29:10,724
I say. The sort of people who go caravanning.
Can you imagine?

271
00:29:10,807 --> 00:29:14,519
Sleeping on four wheels by choice. I ask you.

272
00:29:15,437 --> 00:29:17,898
- Very good.
- Go get them, Harry.

273
00:29:20,483 --> 00:29:22,986
Harry said I'd be bored stiff but I love it.

274
00:29:24,654 --> 00:29:27,199
- Hey, hi.
- I beg your pardon.

275
00:29:27,282 --> 00:29:28,825
Granted.

276
00:29:28,909 --> 00:29:32,370
Lady Hardwick is the wife of
our high commissioner, Sir Gifford.

277
00:29:32,454 --> 00:29:36,124
- Good for you, girl.
- Lady Hardwick to you.

278
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:39,085
- And who might you be?
- Gwen Traherne.

279
00:29:40,086 --> 00:29:42,923
My husband... ex-husband is the engineer.

280
00:29:44,007 --> 00:29:46,009
We have met.

281
00:29:46,092 --> 00:29:47,886
Four times.

282
00:29:48,803 --> 00:29:51,556
- I don't think so.
- Come on, girls, relax.

283
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:55,560
- I'm an American.
- How very hubbly-jubbly for you.

284
00:29:56,895 --> 00:29:59,397
- Hubbly-jubbly.
- Excuse me.

285
00:30:02,192 --> 00:30:03,693
What's with her?

286
00:30:04,236 --> 00:30:05,862
That's our family done for.

287
00:30:05,946 --> 00:30:07,739
- Bollocks.
- You watch.

288
00:30:08,865 --> 00:30:12,869
- What am I doing, Gwen?
- There was a to-do with Lady Riva.

289
00:30:12,953 --> 00:30:16,081
- Good God. Lady Riva's erupted.
- What?

290
00:30:16,164 --> 00:30:18,208
Ruby, you're an angel.

291
00:30:21,962 --> 00:30:24,422
- What did I tell you?
- You're kidding me?

292
00:30:29,261 --> 00:30:32,722
I'm being sent home. You guys want a ride?

293
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:41,982
Toodle-pip.

294
00:30:44,734 --> 00:30:47,320
- Damn them all.
- Go, Ruby!

295
00:30:53,702 --> 00:30:55,996
Lady Riva's upset? What about poor Gwen?

296
00:30:56,079 --> 00:30:58,290
She simply introduced me to the old woman.

297
00:30:58,373 --> 00:31:00,125
She's not a woman, she's a lady.

298
00:31:00,208 --> 00:31:02,669
Not by my reckoning, she's not.
What was Gwen's crime?

299
00:31:02,752 --> 00:31:05,922
She spoke to Lady Hardwick first
before waiting to be spoken to.

300
00:31:06,006 --> 00:31:08,717
- It's just not done.
- Oh, come on, Charles.

301
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,888
I've been to college.
I've flown around the globe a couple of times.

302
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:15,223
You're telling me I have to hold my tongue

303
00:31:15,307 --> 00:31:17,767
till old Lady Doodah chooses to speak to me?

304
00:31:17,851 --> 00:31:20,854
- For the sake of peace.
- I'll give that old witch a piece...

305
00:31:20,937 --> 00:31:23,148
- Children present.
- She was rude.

306
00:31:23,231 --> 00:31:26,484
- They were my witnesses.
- Right, well.

307
00:31:26,568 --> 00:31:29,863
Oh, by the way, Harry, we've just had
confirmation that you-know-who

308
00:31:29,946 --> 00:31:32,824
will be here for the independence
handover brouhaha.

309
00:31:32,908 --> 00:31:36,661
- Who? Who is you-know-who?
- Hush-hush, I'm afraid.

310
00:31:36,745 --> 00:31:39,456
I'll let myself out, thank you. Toodle-pip, all.

311
00:31:39,539 --> 00:31:41,875
Toodle-pip, Charles.

312
00:31:43,126 --> 00:31:45,712
Toodle-pip? Toodle-pip and hush-hush?

313
00:31:45,795 --> 00:31:49,216
Why do they all speak in
this snooty baby-talk all the time?

314
00:31:49,299 --> 00:31:52,886
Blah-blah this, ta-ta that,
hubbly-jubbly, hoity-toity,

315
00:31:52,969 --> 00:31:55,889
toodle-loo, ding-dong.

316
00:31:55,972 --> 00:31:58,099
Sounds like a load of old wah-wah.

317
00:32:46,481 --> 00:32:48,358
How very hubbly-jubbly.

318
00:32:49,651 --> 00:32:51,695
It's all just wah-wah to me.

319
00:32:54,948 --> 00:32:59,744
- She's all right, isn't she?
- Maybe. Maybe not.

320
00:32:59,828 --> 00:33:02,038
Happiest I've ever seen your old man.

321
00:33:02,122 --> 00:33:05,208
Maybe. Still feels weird, though.

322
00:33:05,292 --> 00:33:09,504
- Vernon, your mom wants you home.
- Thanks, Mrs Compton.

323
00:33:09,588 --> 00:33:12,299
- Call me Ruby.
- All right.

324
00:33:12,382 --> 00:33:14,217
Cheers, Ruby. See you, mate.

325
00:33:14,301 --> 00:33:17,137
Glad you didn't throw those puppets away, then?

326
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:19,931
- I'm sorry.
- No problem.

327
00:33:20,015 --> 00:33:22,517
Can you remember the first time you did it?

328
00:33:22,601 --> 00:33:24,644
Did what?

329
00:33:26,146 --> 00:33:28,190
- I've stopped.
- Go on.

330
00:33:28,273 --> 00:33:30,650
I dare you. Just once.

331
00:33:34,362 --> 00:33:36,406
Come on.

332
00:33:54,424 --> 00:33:56,843
I'd say they're all out now, wouldn't you?

333
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:19,324
Here comes the porcupine.

334
00:34:20,575 --> 00:34:23,119
I've had the most incredible idea.

335
00:34:24,204 --> 00:34:30,335
We might gift the Swazi nation with
a diddly-doozup swansong of our own.

336
00:34:31,419 --> 00:34:33,171
Plain English, please, Charles.

337
00:34:33,255 --> 00:34:36,675
I propose we mount a farewell musical
for Her Most Royal Highness.

338
00:34:37,551 --> 00:34:39,886
- What do you have in mind?
- Camelot.

339
00:34:41,888 --> 00:34:43,932
All those in favour say aye.

340
00:34:44,891 --> 00:34:48,019
- Can I be in it?
- Which royal highness?

341
00:34:48,103 --> 00:34:50,689
I'm afraid that's still hush-hush, Gwennie.

342
00:34:50,772 --> 00:34:53,525
The good news is Tobias
has agreed to produce the show

343
00:34:53,608 --> 00:34:55,360
once we get the tra-la-la from HQ.

344
00:34:55,443 --> 00:34:59,489
- On condition we can find singers.
- Tobias, of course we can.

345
00:34:59,573 --> 00:35:02,784
Dozen sings like a dream.

346
00:35:07,622 --> 00:35:09,708
I'm afraid it's for club members only.

347
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:13,503
- Great. I'll propose him, then.
- Bravo. Hear, hear.

348
00:35:15,672 --> 00:35:17,716
I take it, then, I have your support?

349
00:35:19,092 --> 00:35:23,471
Hang on, you want to mount a medieval
musical for a minor British royal.

350
00:35:23,555 --> 00:35:27,017
Aren't we supposed to be celebrating
African independence here?

351
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:30,645
- It's a symbolic gesture.
- What do you think, Dr Zim?

352
00:35:30,729 --> 00:35:33,773
Excellent idea.
A perfect antidote for Princess Margaret

353
00:35:33,857 --> 00:35:37,360
before she endures a whole day
of Swazi tribal dancing.

354
00:35:37,444 --> 00:35:39,279
Princess Margaret!

355
00:35:39,362 --> 00:35:41,323
Who told you it was Princess Margaret?

356
00:35:41,406 --> 00:35:43,450
You did, Charles.

357
00:35:48,163 --> 00:35:50,540
The other Mrs Compton is here.

358
00:35:57,714 --> 00:36:01,760
Don't wish to intrude. Charles. June.

359
00:36:02,636 --> 00:36:06,306
Sorry I'm late. Excuse me, please.

360
00:36:12,145 --> 00:36:14,189
Where's my husband?

361
00:36:14,272 --> 00:36:15,899
- Come on.
- Mum.

362
00:36:15,982 --> 00:36:18,735
- Where's my husband?
- What are you doing here?

363
00:36:18,818 --> 00:36:20,153
I had no choice.

364
00:36:20,237 --> 00:36:23,698
I've been stuck at Shadler & Shadler,
trying to sort out visiting rights.

365
00:36:23,782 --> 00:36:26,660
- Where's my husband?
- You were coming down next weekend.

366
00:36:26,743 --> 00:36:29,454
Is that what he told you? Damn liar.

367
00:36:29,538 --> 00:36:32,415
- Answer me.
- Shut up. Keep out of this.

368
00:36:32,499 --> 00:36:34,543
- Where is he?
- I warned you.

369
00:36:37,671 --> 00:36:39,339
I saw you, Mum.

370
00:36:40,048 --> 00:36:41,508
I beg your pardon?

371
00:36:41,591 --> 00:36:43,426
Two years ago with Uncle John.

372
00:36:45,136 --> 00:36:47,305
That night, in the car with him.

373
00:36:49,266 --> 00:36:51,309
You're imagining things, darling.

374
00:36:55,355 --> 00:36:56,898
I can explain...

375
00:37:05,365 --> 00:37:09,244
- Ralphie, are you all right?
- Hang on. Shadler & Shadler.

376
00:37:17,711 --> 00:37:21,506
"Our client has experienced
frustration and delay

377
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:24,176
and the placing of obstacles
in the way of exercising

378
00:37:24,259 --> 00:37:26,011
her rights of access to her child.

379
00:37:26,094 --> 00:37:28,722
Your client has
wilfully misinterpreted attempts..."

380
00:37:28,805 --> 00:37:30,223
Bastard!

381
00:37:31,349 --> 00:37:33,393
I'm so sorry, my boy.

382
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:37,022
Why did Lauren choose to show up today?

383
00:37:37,105 --> 00:37:41,234
Don't you think for one moment
that I don't understand...

384
00:37:44,404 --> 00:37:45,906
Sorry I'm late.

385
00:37:48,783 --> 00:37:51,786
- So, what day is it today?
- It's Saturday, sweetie.

386
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:56,124
Then it'll be the hen with its arse in the air.

387
00:37:56,208 --> 00:38:00,170
- No, thanks, sweetie, I'm not hungry.
- Hey, honey, please.

388
00:38:00,253 --> 00:38:03,590
Why do we always have chicken
on Saturday and beef on Sunday?

389
00:38:03,673 --> 00:38:05,050
Regina can't read.

390
00:38:05,133 --> 00:38:08,386
Dolly-boy's mother taught her
to do a different meal

391
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:11,097
for each day of the week. Clear?

392
00:38:11,181 --> 00:38:13,099
Got it? Comprende?

393
00:38:13,183 --> 00:38:16,394
- Then I'll teach her to read.
- The bloody hell you will.

394
00:38:16,478 --> 00:38:19,856
- What's wrong with you, Dad?
- Nothing wrong with me, sonny boy.

395
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:22,400
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Listen to yourself.

396
00:38:22,484 --> 00:38:27,155
Look at yourself. You're nothing
but a bloody common ex-air hostess.

397
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:28,949
Fuck you, Harry.

398
00:38:32,953 --> 00:38:34,246
Sorry.

399
00:38:41,044 --> 00:38:43,797
Quelle surprise! Hen with its arse in the air.

400
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:47,133
- Sit down.
- You knew Mum was coming to see me.

401
00:38:47,217 --> 00:38:48,969
So why didn't you bloody tell me?

402
00:38:49,052 --> 00:38:51,930
- Shut up.
- No. You shut up.

403
00:38:52,681 --> 00:38:54,391
Where do you think you're going?

404
00:38:58,687 --> 00:39:00,730
Shut up!

405
00:39:23,879 --> 00:39:25,422
What happened?

406
00:39:25,505 --> 00:39:27,507
Nothing.

407
00:39:27,591 --> 00:39:30,010
- Well, what, then?
- Nothing.

408
00:39:30,093 --> 00:39:31,678
It doesn't matter.

409
00:39:32,179 --> 00:39:33,763
Where's Uncle John?

410
00:39:34,806 --> 00:39:36,850
Playing golf.

411
00:39:39,853 --> 00:39:41,605
So, what do you want to do today?

412
00:39:42,731 --> 00:39:45,400
Don't know. Maybe drop me off at the club later?

413
00:39:47,068 --> 00:39:49,112
All right. What's on?

414
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:59,998
- Hello, mate. What you doing here?
- Don't ask.

415
00:40:00,081 --> 00:40:02,375
Have a gander at this.

416
00:40:02,459 --> 00:40:05,795
They can't sing, can't dance, all of them too old.

417
00:40:05,879 --> 00:40:08,340
- But we're not. Come on.
- No chance.

418
00:40:08,423 --> 00:40:10,592
Come on, you great dimbo.

419
00:40:10,675 --> 00:40:13,220
No, no, she won't do, Tobias.

420
00:40:13,303 --> 00:40:15,889
You can't have a royal played
by a commoner with no neck.

421
00:40:15,972 --> 00:40:18,683
- At least she can sing, Lady H.
- Who's she?

422
00:40:18,767 --> 00:40:21,102
Monica. Taj Mahal's daughter.

423
00:40:21,186 --> 00:40:24,314
How can she be?
They look like different species.

424
00:40:26,066 --> 00:40:28,735
I say, do you mind?
We're trying to take notes here.

425
00:40:28,818 --> 00:40:32,572
Right, which of you little buggers
is gonna bleat for us first?

426
00:40:32,656 --> 00:40:34,157
- Go on.
- Not the one in stripes.

427
00:40:34,241 --> 00:40:38,620
- Go on, my boy.
- Come on, Ralph, hurry up.

428
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:43,083
Bunny will give you the intro.

429
00:40:49,923 --> 00:40:57,722
# All things bright and beautiful
All creatures great and small

430
00:40:57,806 --> 00:41:05,146
# All things wise and wonderful
The Lord God made them all

431
00:41:05,856 --> 00:41:09,609
# Each little flower that opens

432
00:41:09,693 --> 00:41:13,613
# Each little bird that sings

433
00:41:13,697 --> 00:41:22,330
# He made their glowing colours
He made their tiny wings

434
00:41:22,914 --> 00:41:30,088
# All things bright and beautiful
All creatures great and small

435
00:41:31,089 --> 00:41:39,973
# All things wise and wonderful
The Lord God made them all

436
00:41:41,683 --> 00:41:43,727
- Well done.
- Very good.

437
00:41:47,272 --> 00:41:50,108
- I did my audition.
- Fabulous. You get the part?

438
00:41:51,318 --> 00:41:55,155
- I have to wait and see.
- Over my dead bloody body.

439
00:41:55,238 --> 00:41:57,616
Where's the key?

440
00:41:57,699 --> 00:41:59,910
- Cat got your tongue?
- Haven't you had enough?

441
00:41:59,993 --> 00:42:03,788
Stop trying to control me all the
time, woman. Where's the bloody key?

442
00:42:03,872 --> 00:42:06,499
Please, Dad, I'm asking you really nicely.

443
00:42:06,583 --> 00:42:09,920
- Give me the bloody key.
- Please, Dad, don't have any more.

444
00:42:10,754 --> 00:42:14,633
- Stay out of this. Get me some ice.
- Honey, let's have an early night.

445
00:42:14,716 --> 00:42:17,969
- Are you deaf?
- Stop it. Will you stop it?

446
00:42:18,053 --> 00:42:20,555
Please, Dad, don't. Please don't.

447
00:42:38,823 --> 00:42:42,536
I suppose you think this is all so bloody easy.

448
00:42:42,619 --> 00:42:44,663
Well, wake up.

449
00:42:45,330 --> 00:42:48,792
Just you wait until you lose everything.

450
00:42:48,875 --> 00:42:51,294
And I mean everything.

451
00:42:51,378 --> 00:42:56,550
Wife, position, future.
The whole damn kit and caboodle.

452
00:42:56,633 --> 00:42:59,761
Come independence,
we're all on the scrapheap.

453
00:42:59,845 --> 00:43:02,222
- So wake up.
- Spare us the martyrdom, Dad.

454
00:43:02,305 --> 00:43:04,307
You're drunk.

455
00:43:04,391 --> 00:43:07,227
I've had enough of you, you pompous little shit.

456
00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:11,231
- Forget about your fucking Camelot.
- And you're a liar. And a loser.

457
00:43:11,314 --> 00:43:13,984
- I'll knock your bloody block off.
- Stop it.

458
00:43:17,529 --> 00:43:21,575
Open this door. Open this bloody door.

459
00:43:21,658 --> 00:43:28,081
Open it. Open this door!
I'll knock your bloody block off!

460
00:43:28,164 --> 00:43:30,876
Open this door.

461
00:43:30,959 --> 00:43:33,587
Open this bloody door!

462
00:43:35,213 --> 00:43:41,595
Nothing that I said or did last night...

463
00:43:43,013 --> 00:43:45,056
...was the truth.

464
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,643
None of it.

465
00:43:50,061 --> 00:43:52,105
That clear?

466
00:43:56,359 --> 00:44:00,113
- It's what you always say, Dad.
- It'll be different this time.

467
00:44:01,573 --> 00:44:04,034
- Is it because of me?
- No.

468
00:44:06,912 --> 00:44:08,914
- Me?
- No.

469
00:44:20,509 --> 00:44:22,552
I must go, I'm...

470
00:44:22,636 --> 00:44:24,679
I'm late for work.

471
00:44:28,808 --> 00:44:31,394
Did you mean what you said about Camelot?

472
00:44:31,478 --> 00:44:33,522
Of course not, no.

473
00:44:39,027 --> 00:44:40,946
I can't deal with this.

474
00:44:41,446 --> 00:44:42,948
I knew he drank but...

475
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:45,784
Doesn't everyone out here?

476
00:44:48,411 --> 00:44:50,455
Not like him.

477
00:44:53,959 --> 00:44:57,170
He gets really legless
when no-one else is around except us.

478
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:22,195
# Onward, Christian soldiers

479
00:45:22,279 --> 00:45:25,949
# Marching as to war

480
00:45:26,491 --> 00:45:33,582
# With the cross of Jesus going on before

481
00:45:34,749 --> 00:45:36,793
Bravo.

482
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:40,213
Charles.

483
00:45:45,844 --> 00:45:47,345
What?

484
00:45:47,429 --> 00:45:49,598
Who is this Dozen person?

485
00:45:50,515 --> 00:45:52,017
- Our gardener.
- What?

486
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:54,436
A, He's not a club member.

487
00:45:54,519 --> 00:45:57,147
And B, Lancelot is supposed to be French.

488
00:45:57,230 --> 00:45:59,816
- French?
- This is an outrage. Tobias!

489
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:02,652
A, Dozen is a club member as of today and B,

490
00:46:02,736 --> 00:46:05,363
he is the only man who can reach
the top notes and stay in tune.

491
00:46:05,447 --> 00:46:09,659
You will not have the last word
on this, Tobias Brown. That is my prerogative.

492
00:46:10,702 --> 00:46:12,746
Charles! Chop, chop.

493
00:46:14,331 --> 00:46:18,126
I can't believe I'm playing the Queen
and you're playing Mordred.

494
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:19,586
Congratulations.

495
00:46:20,921 --> 00:46:23,048
- You too.
- Well done, Ralphie.

496
00:46:27,719 --> 00:46:29,596
I think I'm in love, Vern.

497
00:46:29,679 --> 00:46:33,725
- You haven't got a chance, matey.
- Watch me.

498
00:46:37,103 --> 00:46:39,564
I got the part. I got the part.

499
00:46:39,648 --> 00:46:41,650
I knew you would.

500
00:46:41,733 --> 00:46:46,029
- Dozen is going to be Lancelot.
- God, that'll teach the old bat.

501
00:46:46,112 --> 00:46:49,282
- Too right.
- Who sanctioned Dozen to audition?

502
00:46:49,366 --> 00:46:52,702
Oh, hush-hush, I'm afraid, Charles. Drink?

503
00:46:52,786 --> 00:46:56,873
That's not funny.
I don't think you realise just what you've done.

504
00:46:56,957 --> 00:46:59,584
Lady Hardwick is throttling
for your blood right now.

505
00:46:59,668 --> 00:47:03,338
- Does Harry know about all this?
- Know about what?

506
00:47:03,421 --> 00:47:05,423
It's hush-hush, I'm afraid, honey.

507
00:47:08,301 --> 00:47:10,554
Attagirl, you're catching on.

508
00:47:10,637 --> 00:47:16,017
- Whose side are you on, Harry?
- OK, toodly-pip-pip-pip, Charles.

509
00:47:16,101 --> 00:47:22,148
- I got the part, Dad.
- Congratulations, Popeye. Well done.

510
00:47:22,232 --> 00:47:25,610
Can I stay at Vern's tonight?
We've got rehearsals. He lives closer.

511
00:47:25,694 --> 00:47:29,072
- So long as your mom doesn't mind.
- I'll grab my bag.

512
00:47:32,409 --> 00:47:34,452
Look and learn.

513
00:47:35,745 --> 00:47:37,205
Evening, Mrs Malaga.

514
00:47:37,289 --> 00:47:40,041
Has anyone ever told you
who you're the spitting image of?

515
00:47:40,125 --> 00:47:43,044
- No, love, who?
- Elizabeth Taylor.

516
00:47:43,128 --> 00:47:45,505
Scout's honour.

517
00:47:45,589 --> 00:47:49,301
Look, I know it's an 18,
but we're studying the book at school

518
00:47:49,384 --> 00:47:51,887
and wondered if you could make
an academic exception.

519
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:53,722
Just this once. Please.

520
00:47:57,934 --> 00:47:59,978
These are on the house, love.

521
00:48:00,061 --> 00:48:01,938
But not a word to anyone.

522
00:48:04,149 --> 00:48:05,317
Thanks.

523
00:48:10,363 --> 00:48:13,533
- You're shameless, you are.
- Got us in, didn't it?

524
00:48:16,411 --> 00:48:18,663
That's disgusting. Where's Charlie's wife?

525
00:48:18,747 --> 00:48:21,875
- Home leave in England.
- How are we gonna get out?

526
00:48:21,958 --> 00:48:24,002
Crawl out, just before the end.

527
00:49:02,123 --> 00:49:04,167
- See you, Liz.
- Thanks, Liz.

528
00:49:07,504 --> 00:49:10,090
P is for pot.

529
00:49:10,173 --> 00:49:13,969
Hey, Ralph, come here.
We'll do some more later, Regina.

530
00:49:14,052 --> 00:49:15,428
Thank you.

531
00:49:15,512 --> 00:49:17,889
- Where were you last night?
- You know where.

532
00:49:17,973 --> 00:49:21,101
- Singing rehearsals.
- Singing rehearsals. Who was there?

533
00:49:21,184 --> 00:49:23,520
- The usual bunch.
- What did you sing?

534
00:49:23,603 --> 00:49:26,439
- Songs from the show.
- Don't lie. I know where you were.

535
00:49:29,401 --> 00:49:30,861
Sit down.

536
00:49:33,530 --> 00:49:37,659
- What's eating you? Dad drunk again?
- Answer my question. Don't be rude.

537
00:49:37,742 --> 00:49:40,495
What's it got to do with you?
You're not my real mother.

538
00:49:40,579 --> 00:49:43,748
Oh, oh, oh, I've been waiting for that one.

539
00:49:43,832 --> 00:49:46,126
- Someone saw you, Ralph.
- So?

540
00:49:46,209 --> 00:49:49,045
- So it's illegal.
- So what?

541
00:49:49,129 --> 00:49:53,216
- Think an X-flick compares with this house?
- I don't give a damn about ratings.

542
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:55,677
I won't stand being lied to.

543
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:59,097
We all lie.
Everyone's bonking everyone round here.

544
00:49:59,181 --> 00:50:01,808
Because they're not divorced,
we pretend they're not.

545
00:50:01,892 --> 00:50:04,144
Like we pretend Dad's not a total drunk.

546
00:50:04,227 --> 00:50:06,396
- Bullshit.
- What would you know, anyway?

547
00:50:06,479 --> 00:50:08,773
You're nothing but a common little air hostess.

548
00:50:12,485 --> 00:50:14,696
- What's going on?
- You deal with this.

549
00:50:17,199 --> 00:50:19,242
- She hit me.
- I'm sure she's very sorry.

550
00:50:19,326 --> 00:50:22,037
May I remind you that Ruby is not the enemy?

551
00:50:22,621 --> 00:50:25,040
- She cares a great deal about you.
- You can talk.

552
00:50:25,123 --> 00:50:27,459
- You called her common.
- I did nothing of the sort.

553
00:50:27,542 --> 00:50:30,086
Yes, you did. You were drunk. Ask her.

554
00:50:30,170 --> 00:50:32,672
That's it. You're grounded. Go to your room.

555
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:46,937
- You can't stay. Scarper.
- I can't. Let me in.

556
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:51,316
- Vernon, are you still in there?
- No, this is a recording.

557
00:50:53,568 --> 00:50:56,696
- Since when did you smoke?
- Since forever.

558
00:50:58,031 --> 00:51:00,700
- Do you want some, or not?
- I'll fall off my bike.

559
00:51:01,701 --> 00:51:03,745
Suit yourself.

560
00:51:11,461 --> 00:51:14,089
- What'll happen now?
- Only everything.

561
00:51:15,841 --> 00:51:17,884
Ralph, give us it back.

562
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:28,937
And what are you two doing here?

563
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:32,941
- What's it look like, Charlie?
- Uncle Charles to you, thank you.

564
00:51:33,024 --> 00:51:35,610
- I am not a Charlie.
- You could've fooled me.

565
00:51:35,694 --> 00:51:38,196
- You're not my uncle, either.
- Stop laughing.

566
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:41,700
- Aren't you both grounded?
- So it was you who grassed on us!

567
00:51:41,783 --> 00:51:43,952
Of course. Your pornographic behaviour

568
00:51:44,035 --> 00:51:45,787
is a consequence of seeing that filth.

569
00:51:45,871 --> 00:51:49,416
- You ought to be ashamed of yourselves.
- Not half as ashamed as we were of you.

570
00:51:49,499 --> 00:51:51,293
I beg your pardon!

571
00:51:51,751 --> 00:51:53,170
We saw you there.

572
00:51:53,253 --> 00:51:57,716
- With what's her name?
- January, February...

573
00:51:57,799 --> 00:51:59,384
- March...
- April...

574
00:51:59,467 --> 00:52:01,219
- May...
- June. So what?

575
00:52:01,303 --> 00:52:05,891
So you're a married man, Charlie,
snogging another man's wife.

576
00:52:05,974 --> 00:52:09,603
- You want seeing to, you two.
- Don't beat us, sir, we're under age!

577
00:52:10,979 --> 00:52:13,440
You're late, late, late. Too late.

578
00:52:13,523 --> 00:52:15,317
- Sorry, Tobias.
- It's not good enough.

579
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:17,152
I can hardly inform Her Highness

580
00:52:17,235 --> 00:52:21,114
Mordred has forgotten his song and
dance because he's too late, can we?

581
00:52:21,198 --> 00:52:24,117
- I told you we shouldn't cast him.
- Please, Riva.

582
00:52:24,201 --> 00:52:26,119
Out, both of you!

583
00:52:26,203 --> 00:52:29,581
I'd already told them. Now, skedaddle!

584
00:52:29,664 --> 00:52:33,126
And I expect you to be word-perfect
and punctual next time.

585
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:35,378
Understood?

586
00:52:41,134 --> 00:52:43,428
- Dance!
- All right.

587
00:52:44,971 --> 00:52:47,015
Ready, Gwen? Lovely, long neck.

588
00:52:47,933 --> 00:52:50,644
And one and two.

589
00:52:50,727 --> 00:52:53,230
Where the bloody hell
have you been gallivanting

590
00:52:53,313 --> 00:52:58,401
or have you forgotten
that you've been grounded until further notice,

591
00:52:58,485 --> 00:53:00,195
Tarzan?

592
00:53:00,278 --> 00:53:04,199
- At rehearsals.
- Rehearsals, my arse.

593
00:53:04,282 --> 00:53:06,952
You haven't even the decency
to apologise, have you?

594
00:53:07,035 --> 00:53:11,623
Prancing around like a pansified little ponce.

595
00:53:11,706 --> 00:53:14,584
- Drop it. It doesn't matter.
- Yes, it does.

596
00:53:14,668 --> 00:53:17,587
Who the hell do you think you are?
Margot fucking Fonteyn?

597
00:53:17,671 --> 00:53:20,757
- No, your fucking son.
- Stop it, both of you.

598
00:53:20,841 --> 00:53:24,177
You stay out of this.
This is between me and him.

599
00:53:24,261 --> 00:53:26,054
I don't care about an apology.

600
00:53:26,137 --> 00:53:32,227
Don't you ever use that language
in front of me again, young man.

601
00:53:33,019 --> 00:53:35,730
- That understood?
- Yes, sir.

602
00:53:35,814 --> 00:53:39,526
Loud and fucking clearly.
And you're drunk, just for a change.

603
00:53:39,609 --> 00:53:42,362
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- You stay right here.

604
00:53:42,445 --> 00:53:46,324
- You stay where you fucking are. I'm outta here.
- Come back, I'm talking to you.

605
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:55,166
Mark my words.
This time, I'll knock your bloody block off.

606
00:53:56,042 --> 00:53:58,336
Stay where you are.

607
00:53:58,420 --> 00:54:00,463
Ruby.

608
00:54:01,047 --> 00:54:03,091
Ruby, open this door.

609
00:54:06,803 --> 00:54:08,847
Open up this bloody door!

610
00:54:12,392 --> 00:54:14,436
Bastard.

611
00:54:31,912 --> 00:54:34,247
What do you think you're doing?

612
00:54:53,433 --> 00:54:56,520
Stay where you are. Fucking fairy.

613
00:54:58,063 --> 00:55:01,191
Not so bloody smart now, are you?

614
00:55:03,610 --> 00:55:05,612
Go on. Do it.

615
00:55:08,114 --> 00:55:09,324
Shoot.

616
00:55:21,837 --> 00:55:23,755
Go on.

617
00:55:35,183 --> 00:55:37,227
Ralph.

618
00:56:03,962 --> 00:56:06,006
Come on, please, Ralphie, get in.

619
00:56:16,391 --> 00:56:20,145
Come on, please, Ralphie.
He is desperate to talk to you.

620
00:56:24,983 --> 00:56:28,653
- I'm scared of him.
- Don't be scared. Come on, get in.

621
00:56:37,078 --> 00:56:40,373
That monster isn't really him, you know that.

622
00:56:41,333 --> 00:56:45,337
- Then why do you stay?
- I love him. I love him.

623
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:50,383
I love your dad with every fibre of my being.
I can't help it.

624
00:56:50,467 --> 00:56:52,761
And I know you do, too.

625
00:56:52,844 --> 00:56:54,971
Why does he do this to us?

626
00:56:55,055 --> 00:56:58,391
Honestly, you know,
I don't think he can help himself.

627
00:56:58,475 --> 00:57:01,603
But I can. I'm getting out of here
the day I finish school.

628
00:57:02,270 --> 00:57:06,900
That may be, Ralphie, but you never
really get away, you know.

629
00:57:06,983 --> 00:57:11,488
- It's called family.
- Maybe. Maybe not.

630
00:57:13,031 --> 00:57:17,494
It's just weird that every time my mother makes
any kind of contact, he goes ballistic.

631
00:57:50,610 --> 00:57:52,654
Ruby told me what happened.

632
00:57:54,906 --> 00:57:56,908
I don't remember a bloody thing.

633
00:57:59,911 --> 00:58:02,163
I'm so terribly sorry, Popeye.

634
00:58:03,748 --> 00:58:07,127
I'm begging you for one last chance.

635
00:58:08,670 --> 00:58:10,714
Please, Popeye.

636
00:58:11,464 --> 00:58:14,009
What do you say?

637
00:58:14,092 --> 00:58:16,136
Nothing to say.

638
00:58:17,846 --> 00:58:19,890
Please, Popeye.

639
00:58:21,975 --> 00:58:23,393
Please.

640
00:58:44,289 --> 00:58:46,666
Come in. So...

641
00:58:47,792 --> 00:58:50,921
- How can I help you?
- I don't know how to say this.

642
00:58:51,004 --> 00:58:54,299
Don't you worry. There isn't much
I haven't seen or heard in here.

643
00:58:55,217 --> 00:58:58,386
I think... I think my dad's an alcoholic.

644
00:59:01,723 --> 00:59:04,643
Look, most of us have a bit
of a tipple from time to time.

645
00:59:04,726 --> 00:59:08,146
- How much is a tipple?
- Varies. The odd bottle.

646
00:59:08,230 --> 00:59:10,273
How about a bottle of Scotch per day?

647
00:59:12,734 --> 00:59:14,778
I had no idea.

648
00:59:16,279 --> 00:59:18,156
He tried to shoot me.

649
00:59:24,371 --> 00:59:27,749
- When did this start?
- The night my mother left.

650
00:59:29,292 --> 00:59:31,336
- Can you help me?
- Of course I will, but...

651
00:59:31,419 --> 00:59:33,839
no-one else must know about this.

652
00:59:33,922 --> 00:59:37,551
He's too highly respected in this
country for anyone else to find out.

653
00:59:41,263 --> 00:59:43,306
Thank you.

654
01:00:04,995 --> 01:00:08,331
That you, my boy? Don't get up.

655
01:00:08,415 --> 01:00:10,458
Where's Dad?

656
01:00:10,542 --> 01:00:15,505
He's at the hospital. He's had to see
Dr Zim about something or other.

657
01:00:16,590 --> 01:00:18,758
What's the matter?

658
01:00:18,842 --> 01:00:21,011
I'm sorry to have to say this.

659
01:00:23,847 --> 01:00:25,807
But Ruby's leaving.

660
01:00:26,850 --> 01:00:28,268
What do you mean?

661
01:00:28,351 --> 01:00:32,522
She's staying with me at the moment
till she gets herself sorted out.

662
01:00:32,606 --> 01:00:35,567
She asked me to tell you
because she's just too upset

663
01:00:35,650 --> 01:00:38,570
to see you herself at the moment.

664
01:00:38,653 --> 01:00:41,406
I've just come to collect the rest of her things.

665
01:00:42,449 --> 01:00:45,368
- This is all my fault.
- Not at all.

666
01:00:45,452 --> 01:00:48,455
It's nothing to do with you. Come here.

667
01:00:55,754 --> 01:00:57,797
Ah, my angel boy.

668
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:23,323
Dr Zim has prescribed these anti-booze pills

669
01:01:23,406 --> 01:01:27,452
which will make me sick as a dog
if I so much as touch a drop.

670
01:01:27,536 --> 01:01:31,331
- How did he find out?
- Suppose Ruby told him before she left.

671
01:01:33,792 --> 01:01:37,087
- What are we going to do, Dad?
- I don't know.

672
01:01:37,170 --> 01:01:41,258
Your mother has asked me
for a second chance.

673
01:01:41,341 --> 01:01:43,134
But you're married to Ruby.

674
01:01:44,261 --> 01:01:47,764
Yes. Yes, I know, Popeye, but...

675
01:01:49,432 --> 01:01:52,185
...it doesn't look as if she'll be coming back.

676
01:01:53,562 --> 01:01:57,440
She says the situation is too... conflicted.

677
01:01:58,567 --> 01:02:01,778
So for once, I think your mother may be right.

678
01:02:03,238 --> 01:02:07,325
And I don't want to stand in the way
of that possibility.

679
01:02:08,243 --> 01:02:11,496
But only if you agree, of course.

680
01:02:11,580 --> 01:02:15,292
- What am I supposed to say?
- Yes.

681
01:02:15,375 --> 01:02:17,169
If that's what you want.

682
01:02:24,509 --> 01:02:26,553
Where is she?

683
01:02:59,586 --> 01:03:02,047
I've missed you so much.

684
01:03:07,427 --> 01:03:11,515
You've really done a remarkable job.
This looks wonderful.

685
01:03:11,598 --> 01:03:13,558
Thank you.

686
01:03:13,642 --> 01:03:15,519
Whose idea was all this?

687
01:03:16,228 --> 01:03:17,437
Ruby's.

688
01:03:18,563 --> 01:03:20,607
But everyone helped out.

689
01:03:24,903 --> 01:03:27,113
Do you still use the puppets I gave you?

690
01:03:27,197 --> 01:03:28,281
Of course.

691
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:35,247
- You must do me a show some time.
- OK.

692
01:03:38,708 --> 01:03:40,544
I'll look forward to that.

693
01:03:52,097 --> 01:03:54,140
This looks lovely.

694
01:03:56,309 --> 01:03:58,353
Who did all this?

695
01:04:01,523 --> 01:04:03,275
Thank you.

696
01:04:10,574 --> 01:04:14,244
Thank you, Regina. What have we here?

697
01:04:14,327 --> 01:04:15,954
Spaghetti, madam.

698
01:04:17,330 --> 01:04:18,915
I'm learning to read.

699
01:04:23,211 --> 01:04:26,840
Could you ask your mother to pass the salt,
please?

700
01:04:57,662 --> 01:04:59,706
Don't move.

701
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:22,062
# Stay as sweet as you are

702
01:05:23,647 --> 01:05:29,986
# Don't let a thing ever change you

703
01:05:31,530 --> 01:05:34,866
# Stay as sweet as you are

704
01:05:36,034 --> 01:05:42,332
# Don't let a soul rearrange you

705
01:05:43,917 --> 01:05:47,838
# Don't ever lose

706
01:05:48,588 --> 01:05:52,843
# All the charm you possess

707
01:05:55,262 --> 01:05:58,598
# Your loveliness

708
01:05:59,891 --> 01:06:06,690
# Darling, the way you say yes

709
01:06:08,108 --> 01:06:11,695
# Stay as sweet as you are

710
01:06:12,612 --> 01:06:15,031
# Discreet as you are

711
01:06:16,283 --> 01:06:19,202
# You'sre divine, dear

712
01:06:20,620 --> 01:06:24,457
# Stay as grand as you are

713
01:06:24,541 --> 01:06:31,131
# And as you are,
tell me that you'sre mine, dear

714
01:06:32,799 --> 01:06:34,843
June.

715
01:06:40,390 --> 01:06:42,309
I spy with my little eye.

716
01:06:42,392 --> 01:06:45,103
- Hello, Ralphie.
- Auntie June.

717
01:06:45,187 --> 01:06:48,315
- Morning, ma'am.
- Haven't seen you at rehearsals lately.

718
01:06:48,398 --> 01:06:50,442
I've had to miss a few.

719
01:06:51,484 --> 01:06:53,528
Where's the American?

720
01:06:54,529 --> 01:06:56,573
Good morning, ladies.

721
01:06:59,701 --> 01:07:02,871
Ralph, you must come riding some time.

722
01:07:02,954 --> 01:07:06,041
- I'd like to, thank you.
- Toodle-pip. Trot on.

723
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:10,587
I'm not invisible, you know.

724
01:07:11,796 --> 01:07:15,425
No, you're a divorcee, which is far worse.

725
01:07:18,220 --> 01:07:19,679
Excuse me.

726
01:07:20,972 --> 01:07:22,182
We're leaving.

727
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:39,241
How dare they?

728
01:07:39,324 --> 01:07:41,368
How dare they blank me?

729
01:07:42,827 --> 01:07:45,288
And then judge me.

730
01:07:45,372 --> 01:07:48,917
None of them has got
a monogamous bone in their bodies.

731
01:07:58,593 --> 01:08:00,428
What was I supposed to have done?

732
01:08:00,512 --> 01:08:04,808
I honestly thought giving your father
custody was the kindest option.

733
01:08:04,891 --> 01:08:06,726
You'd be at home, have your friends.

734
01:08:06,810 --> 01:08:11,648
Now I'm being vilified like some...
scarlet woman.

735
01:08:13,984 --> 01:08:17,195
My God, I've been a damn fool to
think I could ever come back in here

736
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:20,407
and do battle with that coven of bitches.

737
01:08:21,324 --> 01:08:23,994
What did Uncle John have that Dad didn't?

738
01:08:26,746 --> 01:08:28,665
He says what he means.

739
01:08:28,748 --> 01:08:32,085
Unlike every damned Englishman.

740
01:08:32,169 --> 01:08:35,213
He hasn't got an ironic
or effete bone in his body.

741
01:08:35,297 --> 01:08:37,799
- Is he going back to Auntie Gwen?
- Don't be daft.

742
01:08:37,883 --> 01:08:39,926
He's been transferred to Peru.

743
01:08:51,146 --> 01:08:53,148
Please don't look at me.

744
01:09:25,722 --> 01:09:27,766
Come back.

745
01:09:29,017 --> 01:09:30,769
Please come back.

746
01:09:32,229 --> 01:09:34,272
So that's why she asked to come back.

747
01:09:37,484 --> 01:09:39,528
- Where is she?
- Who cares?

748
01:09:45,867 --> 01:09:47,285
Harry.

749
01:09:50,247 --> 01:09:52,916
- I've lost Ralph.
- You most certainly have.

750
01:09:52,999 --> 01:09:55,669
- What? What do you mean?
- Why didn't you tell me?

751
01:09:55,752 --> 01:09:58,171
Come on, don't play games.

752
01:09:58,255 --> 01:10:01,258
Is he here? Where is he?

753
01:10:01,341 --> 01:10:03,385
Why don't you try Peru?

754
01:10:07,764 --> 01:10:09,599
- I see.
- Do you?

755
01:10:09,683 --> 01:10:12,727
Pity I didn't. I think it best that you leave.

756
01:10:13,895 --> 01:10:15,897
- Immediately.
- Don't be ridiculous.

757
01:10:15,981 --> 01:10:18,149
God, you've changed your tune, haven't you?

758
01:10:18,233 --> 01:10:20,360
Not that long ago, you were begging me to stay.

759
01:10:20,443 --> 01:10:22,320
Just leave. Please.

760
01:10:22,404 --> 01:10:25,365
- I need to speak to Ralph.
- He doesn't want to see you.

761
01:10:25,448 --> 01:10:28,243
- Don't be stupid. I'm his mother.
- Were.

762
01:10:30,996 --> 01:10:33,331
Harry, let me in! Regina.

763
01:10:34,791 --> 01:10:36,835
Regina, let me in.

764
01:10:41,506 --> 01:10:43,550
Let me in.

765
01:11:34,809 --> 01:11:36,853
How many friends do you have?

766
01:11:39,397 --> 01:11:44,402
My father claimed that if you had
five true friends in your life,

767
01:11:44,486 --> 01:11:46,530
you were a rich man.

768
01:11:48,698 --> 01:11:53,119
- Who do you truly love?
- You make it sound so easy, Popeye.

769
01:11:57,791 --> 01:12:00,627
It is easy, Dad. Just call her.

770
01:12:01,753 --> 01:12:03,171
Who?

771
01:12:03,255 --> 01:12:05,048
Who do you think?

01:12:28,572 --> 01:12:31,533
# He was this famous trumpet man
from out Chicago way

773
01:12:31,616 --> 01:12:33,827
# He had a boogie style that no-one else...

774
01:12:33,910 --> 01:12:36,246
- I'm so sorry.
- Me too.

775
01:12:36,746 --> 01:12:40,041
# But then his number came up
and he was gone with the draft

776
01:12:40,125 --> 01:12:42,460
# He'ss in the army now a-blowing reveille

777
01:12:42,544 --> 01:12:44,921
# He'ss the boogie-woogie bugle boy
of Company B

778
01:12:45,005 --> 01:12:47,382
- Quits?
- Quits.

779
01:12:49,509 --> 01:12:51,636
Yes, I was an air hostess...

780
01:12:52,637 --> 01:12:56,349
Just long enough to learn how to deal
with very difficult passengers.

781
01:12:56,433 --> 01:13:01,146
I hate to intrude, folks, but we do
need Mordred back in rehearsals.

782
01:13:01,229 --> 01:13:03,273
Up to Ralph, right?

783
01:13:05,442 --> 01:13:07,194
- Are you sure?
- Damn sure.

784
01:13:07,277 --> 01:13:09,321
Come on, then. Can we take the car?

785
01:13:15,076 --> 01:13:17,954
# He makes the companyjump
when he plays reveille

786
01:13:18,038 --> 01:13:20,790
# He'ss the boogie-woogie bugle boy
of Company B

787
01:13:24,002 --> 01:13:27,339
I'd like to apologise for calling you
by your first name, Uncle Charles.

788
01:13:27,422 --> 01:13:29,174
Gratefully accepted.

789
01:13:29,257 --> 01:13:32,385
When you turn 16,
I shall invite you to drop the "Uncle".

790
01:13:32,761 --> 01:13:34,971
Thank you, sir.

791
01:13:35,055 --> 01:13:38,391
That is it.
We simply cannot wait any longer, June.

792
01:13:38,475 --> 01:13:42,729
- Lancelot will have to walk on.
- Don't shout. You'll scare him.

793
01:13:43,939 --> 01:13:46,733
That is it. Out now.

794
01:13:46,816 --> 01:13:50,403
- I warned you about that horse.
- Excuse me, Lady Riva.

795
01:13:50,487 --> 01:13:53,156
I shall repair to the bar
for approximately 17 minutes.

796
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:56,409
- Do I make myself clear?
- Well, I say.

797
01:13:56,493 --> 01:13:59,246
- I can't work like this.
- It'll be so bad it'll be brilliant.

798
01:13:59,329 --> 01:14:03,875
I heard that. Right, you lot, take
it from the top. Bunny, our note.

799
01:14:03,959 --> 01:14:05,877
One, two, three, four.

800
01:14:05,961 --> 01:14:07,170
# Camelot

801
01:14:07,671 --> 01:14:09,381
# Camelot

802
01:14:09,464 --> 01:14:11,508
# I know it sounds a bit bizarre

803
01:14:13,176 --> 01:14:15,595
# But in Camelot

804
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:17,514
# Camelot

805
01:14:17,597 --> 01:14:19,516
# That's how conditions are

806
01:14:19,599 --> 01:14:22,102
- Hi, guys, how were rehearsals?
- Brilliant.

807
01:14:22,185 --> 01:14:25,146
- Tobias threw a fit.
- What else is new?

808
01:14:25,230 --> 01:14:27,440
- Where's Dad?
- He didn't pick you up?

809
01:14:27,524 --> 01:14:31,319
- We came back on my bike.
- Maybe he had a flat tyre.

810
01:14:31,403 --> 01:14:33,864
OK, I'll go call the club.

811
01:14:33,947 --> 01:14:36,074
- I better get going.
- Thanks, Vern.

812
01:14:36,157 --> 01:14:37,534
See you, mate.

813
01:14:44,291 --> 01:14:46,334
He's not there.

814
01:14:48,336 --> 01:14:51,381
He also refused to take his pill this morning.

815
01:14:52,299 --> 01:14:54,885
I knew I should've made him
swallow the damn thing.

816
01:14:58,263 --> 01:15:01,016
Just act normal, OK?

817
01:15:01,099 --> 01:15:03,143
No matter what, OK?

818
01:15:05,896 --> 01:15:07,939
Ah, the welcoming committee.

819
01:15:08,023 --> 01:15:11,026
Perfect timing.
Don't you want to know where I've been?

820
01:15:11,109 --> 01:15:12,903
Where have you been?

821
01:15:12,986 --> 01:15:18,033
A post-independence educational
strategy and budgeting meeting,

822
01:15:18,116 --> 01:15:20,160
if you really want to know.

823
01:15:21,703 --> 01:15:23,788
Translation, please.

824
01:15:25,999 --> 01:15:28,001
They've asked me to stay on.

825
01:15:30,962 --> 01:15:33,590
Honorary advisor, full salary, full perks.

826
01:15:33,673 --> 01:15:36,968
All post-independence.
What do you think of that?

827
01:15:37,052 --> 01:15:39,721
- You bastard.
- Language.

828
01:15:40,472 --> 01:15:42,557
How could you do that to us?

829
01:15:42,641 --> 01:15:45,435
And you thought I was back
on the old you-know-what.

830
01:15:45,519 --> 01:15:47,938
Oh, you bastard.

831
01:15:48,939 --> 01:15:51,816
- But this is fabulous news, honey.
- Yes.

832
01:15:51,900 --> 01:15:53,944
My God, oh, my God!

833
01:15:57,322 --> 01:16:00,742
My mother wants to know which night
you've booked to see Camelot.

834
01:16:00,825 --> 01:16:03,078
First night. She can go see any of the others.

835
01:16:03,161 --> 01:16:05,747
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

836
01:16:08,625 --> 01:16:10,669
I am so proud of you.

837
01:16:14,214 --> 01:16:16,341
Can you help me with these buttons?

838
01:16:16,424 --> 01:16:19,553
Hurry up, you're nearly on. I can't wait.

839
01:16:19,636 --> 01:16:21,680
Let me help you.

840
01:16:26,977 --> 01:16:28,436
Sorry.

841
01:16:44,411 --> 01:16:45,829
Quick.

842
01:16:45,912 --> 01:16:47,956
You jammy bastard, how'd you do it?

843
01:16:48,039 --> 01:16:49,875
Charisma, my man.

844
01:16:49,958 --> 01:16:52,210
Smile as if your lives depend on it.

845
01:16:52,294 --> 01:16:55,839
Let's see you all curtsy deeply...

846
01:16:56,631 --> 01:17:01,219
...as Her Most Royal Highness
parades past you.

847
01:17:01,303 --> 01:17:03,346
Yes, Uncle Charles.

848
01:17:03,430 --> 01:17:08,727
It's going to be a triumph.
A T-R-l-U-M-P-H, triumph.

849
01:17:26,369 --> 01:17:29,706
- It's like National Geographic.
- Only better.

850
01:17:30,540 --> 01:17:32,459
Countdown, my man.

851
01:17:32,542 --> 01:17:36,379
- Know where you're going next yet?
- Yeah, only bloody Bahrain.

852
01:17:36,463 --> 01:17:38,507
- Where's that?
- Exactly.

853
01:18:27,556 --> 01:18:29,808
- Come on, we can't be late, Dad.
- Come in.

854
01:18:29,891 --> 01:18:32,561
- Ruby.
- Yeah, yeah. Relax, I'm coming.

855
01:18:32,644 --> 01:18:35,480
- Dad, I have a big favour to ask.
- Ask away, Popeye.

856
01:18:37,232 --> 01:18:39,860
Promise me you won't... you-know-what.

857
01:18:41,611 --> 01:18:43,363
- Thank you.
- Had to be done.

858
01:18:43,446 --> 01:18:46,616
- He knows I didn't call Dr Zim.
- That was very brave of you.

859
01:18:46,700 --> 01:18:50,203
There's something you can do for me. Here.

860
01:18:50,287 --> 01:18:53,456
- I can't, Dad.
- There's no such thing as can't.

861
01:18:54,624 --> 01:18:57,669
- Only one thing we want.
- I know, Popeye.

862
01:18:57,752 --> 01:18:59,838
I promise you, I won't let you down.

863
01:18:59,921 --> 01:19:02,799
By the way, good luck tonight.

864
01:19:04,843 --> 01:19:08,305
- How do I look?
- Only fit to meet a princess.

865
01:19:08,388 --> 01:19:10,432
Right answer.

866
01:19:12,601 --> 01:19:14,644
God, you look beautiful.

867
01:19:21,151 --> 01:19:23,737
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, ya.

868
01:19:23,820 --> 01:19:26,114
- Come on.
- Now, concentrate.

869
01:19:26,198 --> 01:19:29,659
And stay calm.
You're all going to be magical.

870
01:19:31,286 --> 01:19:34,539
Her Royal Highness is on her way.

871
01:19:50,263 --> 01:19:51,473
Shit.

872
01:19:51,556 --> 01:19:54,100
- Let's see.
- Please don't, Auntie Gwen.

873
01:19:54,184 --> 01:19:56,228
Come on, Ralphie.

874
01:19:59,523 --> 01:20:01,024
Shit.

875
01:20:11,159 --> 01:20:14,454
Now, it's all up to you.

876
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:18,542
Break a leg. I'll be rooting for you. In the bar.

877
01:20:18,625 --> 01:20:21,878
Thank you. See you later.
Break a leg. Good luck.

878
01:20:25,924 --> 01:20:28,218
Where's Gwen? Where is Gwen?

879
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:34,558
- Out for the count.
- My God.

880
01:20:34,641 --> 01:20:36,810
Run to the bar and fetch Tobias quickly.

881
01:20:37,853 --> 01:20:42,190
- Philip, ice and black coffee fast.
- What the hell are you doing here?

882
01:20:42,274 --> 01:20:45,360
- Guinevere's a goner.
- God, not tonight of all nights.

883
01:20:49,698 --> 01:20:51,616
For heaven's sake.

884
01:20:52,617 --> 01:20:56,204
Come on, girl. Come on, Gwen.

885
01:20:56,288 --> 01:20:59,082
Come on, girl. Come on.

886
01:20:59,165 --> 01:21:01,293
I told you she was too common to play a queen.

887
01:21:01,376 --> 01:21:03,879
She's proved common
beyond commonness incarnate.

888
01:21:03,962 --> 01:21:06,256
Shut up, Riva.

889
01:21:06,339 --> 01:21:11,720
Common I may be,
but you can't act, you can't cook,

890
01:21:11,803 --> 01:21:16,224
you can't even keep His Lordship's
cock out of everybody else's clumps.

891
01:21:17,726 --> 01:21:19,769
Ice bucket, quick.

892
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:25,692
- Get her on stage.
- That's better.

893
01:21:30,113 --> 01:21:32,115
Give her some air.

894
01:21:32,199 --> 01:21:35,702
# No matter the pain
he ought to be unwinceable

895
01:21:36,244 --> 01:21:39,748
# lmpossible deeds should be his daily fare

896
01:21:40,248 --> 01:21:48,507
# But where in the world,
is there in the world a man so extraordinaire?

897
01:21:51,468 --> 01:21:54,971
# C'est moi, c'est moi
I'm forced to admit

898
01:21:55,055 --> 01:21:58,058
# 'Tis I, I humbly reply

899
01:21:58,141 --> 01:22:00,852
# That mortal who these marvels can do

900
01:22:00,936 --> 01:22:03,396
# C'est moi, c'est moi, 'tis I

901
01:22:05,273 --> 01:22:07,317
Well done, Gwen.

902
01:22:09,152 --> 01:22:12,531
It's a triumph, a medieval triumph.

903
01:22:12,614 --> 01:22:14,950
No, it's not, it's a bloody disaster.

904
01:22:15,033 --> 01:22:16,993
- I beg your pardon?
- What do you mean?

905
01:22:17,077 --> 01:22:19,120
Her Royal Highness has departed.

906
01:22:19,204 --> 01:22:21,706
- But it's only the interval.
- Precisely.

907
01:22:21,790 --> 01:22:25,293
- Claims she has an upset stomach.
- Probably the local water.

908
01:22:25,377 --> 01:22:27,420
- Water, my arse.
- Tobias.

909
01:22:29,923 --> 01:22:33,927
- I'm very, very upset.
- Oh, honestly.

910
01:22:45,272 --> 01:22:47,065
# Camelot

911
01:22:48,316 --> 01:22:49,734
# Camelot

912
01:22:49,818 --> 01:22:51,862
Yes, Camelot, my boy.

913
01:22:54,030 --> 01:22:58,201
# Where once it never rained till after sundown

914
01:22:58,285 --> 01:23:02,205
# By 8.00am, the morning fog had flown

915
01:23:02,998 --> 01:23:08,044
# Don't let it be forgot
that once there was a spot

916
01:23:08,128 --> 01:23:15,218
# For one brief, shining moment
that was known as

917
01:23:15,302 --> 01:23:18,638
# Camelot

918
01:23:18,722 --> 01:23:21,474
Run, boy! Run!

919
01:23:42,370 --> 01:23:45,874
You were just so great, it was just so great.

920
01:23:49,794 --> 01:23:51,838
Well done, Ralphie.

921
01:23:53,882 --> 01:23:55,926
You were just fabulous, Popeye.

922
01:23:58,011 --> 01:23:59,012
Marvellous.

923
01:23:59,095 --> 01:24:02,474
Fancy the royal personage leaving
in the interval like that.

924
01:24:02,557 --> 01:24:05,060
- I know.
- Food poisoning, my arse.

925
01:24:06,228 --> 01:24:08,688
Wait till she gets a dose of tribal dancing.

926
01:24:11,441 --> 01:24:13,068
My darling.

927
01:24:14,194 --> 01:24:16,238
My son did very well, didn't he?

928
01:24:23,787 --> 01:24:27,249
Hi, I'm Ruby. He was great.

929
01:24:28,333 --> 01:24:30,377
Aren't you going to Peru?

930
01:24:32,003 --> 01:24:33,255
Come on.

931
01:24:33,338 --> 01:24:36,091
- I thought you were coming tomorrow.
- I wouldn't miss this.

932
01:24:36,174 --> 01:24:38,677
- You've got the pool party, right?
- Wrong.

933
01:24:38,760 --> 01:24:43,431
Just because you married my husband
faster than a sandwich doesn't give you rights.

934
01:24:43,515 --> 01:24:45,308
Don't ever try to turn my son against me.

935
01:24:45,392 --> 01:24:49,396
- You coming, superstar?
- I can't, Mum. I'm really sorry.

936
01:24:51,022 --> 01:24:54,985
- I've come all this way to see you.
- Come on, mate, let's go.

937
01:24:55,068 --> 01:24:57,112
You guys stay as long as you like.

938
01:24:58,905 --> 01:25:00,907
Cuddle, puddle.

939
01:25:07,122 --> 01:25:09,583
- Thank you for saving me.
- My pleasure.

940
01:25:13,753 --> 01:25:17,549
Bye-bye, Swaziland!

941
01:25:19,384 --> 01:25:25,599
# We're all buggered
All busted and bewildered

942
01:25:25,682 --> 01:25:32,314
# We've all got to get our arses out of here

943
01:25:32,397 --> 01:25:37,903
# They don't want us to rule or cause a rumpus

944
01:25:37,986 --> 01:25:44,326
# They just want to kick our arses out of here

945
01:25:45,452 --> 01:25:51,291
# We're all buggered
All busted and bewildered

946
01:25:55,837 --> 01:25:57,881
Take it off!

947
01:26:38,296 --> 01:26:40,173
This is it.

948
01:26:59,234 --> 01:27:02,362
- She's minute.
- Isn't she just marvellous?

949
01:27:13,915 --> 01:27:17,878
- Not quite Cheltenham, is it?
- I wish my mum was alive to see me.

950
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:05,675
No more lah-di-dah, hoity-toity,
hooty-snooty, wah-wah any more.

951
01:28:07,135 --> 01:28:10,055
- Wasn't that just incredible?
- Incredible.

952
01:28:10,805 --> 01:28:13,934
What do you think this little piece
of metal is worth, Popeye?

953
01:28:14,935 --> 01:28:16,853
A big pile of money?

954
01:28:17,145 --> 01:28:19,231
No.

955
01:28:19,314 --> 01:28:22,609
Just a lifetime, old boy. My lifetime.

956
01:28:23,735 --> 01:28:25,695
- You deserve it, Dad.
- Bollocks.

957
01:28:25,779 --> 01:28:29,032
- We are so proud of you.
- Bollocks.

958
01:28:48,552 --> 01:28:50,679
Goddamn it.

959
01:28:50,762 --> 01:28:54,558
I can't feel... I can't feel my bloody arm.

960
01:28:56,601 --> 01:28:59,938
Go and lie down, honey. I'm gonna call Dr Zim.

961
01:29:00,021 --> 01:29:03,316
- Come on.
- No, I'm fine, really.

962
01:29:06,027 --> 01:29:08,864
Don't panic. I'm fine, really.

963
01:29:11,283 --> 01:29:13,410
He won't be able to speak for much longer.

964
01:29:13,493 --> 01:29:16,037
Pressure on the brain will be too great.

965
01:29:16,121 --> 01:29:18,623
Therefore, I propose
that we operate immediately,

966
01:29:18,707 --> 01:29:21,126
try to remove the tumour,

967
01:29:21,209 --> 01:29:23,837
buy him a little more time.

968
01:29:23,920 --> 01:29:26,214
What are you saying, Dr Zim?

969
01:29:26,298 --> 01:29:29,217
At best, we are talking about
just another couple of months.

970
01:29:29,301 --> 01:29:31,052
To what?

971
01:29:33,180 --> 01:29:35,223
To live.

972
01:31:10,151 --> 01:31:13,947
So... we've decided to join forces.

973
01:31:14,030 --> 01:31:16,908
- What about your wife?
- Bolted, I'm afraid.

974
01:31:17,826 --> 01:31:19,244
Staying in Blighty.

975
01:31:19,327 --> 01:31:21,496
You'll never guess where we're headed.

976
01:31:21,580 --> 01:31:24,749
Rhodesia. Isn't that something?

977
01:31:25,417 --> 01:31:28,753
I wonder, would you tell me exactly
whereabouts?

978
01:31:28,837 --> 01:31:32,090
- She doesn't know.
- Sorry, Lady H, he's still asleep.

979
01:31:32,174 --> 01:31:37,512
Terrible business. One just has to
brace oneself. Where's the American?

980
01:31:37,596 --> 01:31:40,390
Whatever you have to say,
say it and say it fast.

981
01:31:41,183 --> 01:31:45,395
Look, I shan't pretend there's been
any love lost between us.

982
01:31:45,478 --> 01:31:49,733
I've come to apologise as I won't be
attending the funeral. Don't do them.

983
01:31:50,650 --> 01:31:55,322
- I'd hate you to think I snubbed it.
- He's not dead yet. Get out.

984
01:32:03,163 --> 01:32:06,208
...the Director-General of the BBC.
They wanted something different,

985
01:32:06,291 --> 01:32:09,336
so I popped down to a little agency
in the Charing Cross Road.

986
01:32:09,419 --> 01:32:12,172
It was called Bona Performers.

987
01:32:12,255 --> 01:32:13,590
Anybody there?

988
01:32:13,673 --> 01:32:16,259
Hello, I'sm Julian. This is my friend Sandy.

989
01:32:18,845 --> 01:32:22,098
- We'sre Bona Performers.
- Bona performers, we are.

990
01:32:22,182 --> 01:32:27,896
It'ss Mr Horne.
How nice to vada yourjolly old eek again.

991
01:32:27,979 --> 01:32:30,440
What brings you trolling in here?

992
01:32:30,524 --> 01:32:34,069
I'sve been asked to organise
a cabaret for the BBC on the 15th.

993
01:32:34,152 --> 01:32:36,196
I was wondering if you could fix me up.

994
01:32:36,279 --> 01:32:37,864
Yes, duckie.

995
01:32:39,491 --> 01:32:42,536
No, we'sd be glad to fix you up any time.

996
01:32:43,328 --> 01:32:46,122
BBC, is it?

997
01:32:46,206 --> 01:32:50,502
You want something a bit risque for that mob.
How about Queenie?

998
01:32:51,628 --> 01:32:53,672
What does Queenie do?

999
01:32:53,755 --> 01:32:56,091
She does strip-tease with a difference.

1000
01:32:56,174 --> 01:32:58,218
Normally she'ss the bearded lady...

1001
01:33:06,309 --> 01:33:08,353
Take my watch.

1002
01:33:19,072 --> 01:33:21,116
Thank you, Popeye.

1003
01:33:30,750 --> 01:33:33,545
I never stopped loving your mother.

1004
01:34:53,959 --> 01:34:58,129
So we say farewell to Mahlaganipani.

1005
01:34:58,213 --> 01:35:04,386
Five friends was his measure of wealth.

1006
01:35:04,469 --> 01:35:09,391
And judging by the numbers around me,
he was indeed a very rich man.

1007
01:35:31,746 --> 01:35:33,790
Toodle-pip, sweetie.

1008
01:35:48,805 --> 01:35:50,849
I loved him so much.

1009
