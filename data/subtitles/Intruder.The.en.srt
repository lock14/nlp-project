1
00:00:20,697 --> 00:00:25,975
INNOCENT

2
00:02:25,337 --> 00:02:27,456
Carriage for Mr. Hermil

3
00:02:27,457 --> 00:02:31,017
-Very good, Mr. Hermil - Thanks

4
00:02:32,177 --> 00:02:35,176
- Here is your carriage, Sire - Thanks

5
00:02:35,177 --> 00:02:39,696
Continue tomorrow. I must rush,
by now I am late. I must go

6
00:02:39,697 --> 00:02:42,767
- agreed, tomorrow - tomorrow

7
00:02:43,617 --> 00:02:45,606
Please?

8
00:02:48,617 --> 00:02:50,606
On guard

9
00:02:52,109 --> 00:02:53,819
I have not understood

10
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:58,056
Well yes, I said that for me the
coldness of English is a myth...

11
00:02:58,057 --> 00:03:01,456
... pure invention - and
who would be the inventor?

12
00:03:01,457 --> 00:03:04,776
- The Italians, perhaps - and
why invent such a thing?

13
00:03:04,777 --> 00:03:07,736
- For envy - Indeed?  Why do you say that?

14
00:03:07,737 --> 00:03:09,726
You don't say?

15
00:04:14,017 --> 00:04:16,276
- Good evening - Good evening

16
00:04:16,277 --> 00:04:21,287
- And how did it end, contessa?
- and he said endure or not

17
00:04:24,617 --> 00:04:26,976
Is it tonight for her to sing Speranza?

18
00:04:26,977 --> 00:04:30,696
- Not, next tuesday
- That's a pity, I shall not be there

19
00:04:32,417 --> 00:04:37,729
- They say that she is extraordinary
- As singer or as woman?

20
00:04:37,817 --> 00:04:40,096
I only mean of song

21
00:04:40,097 --> 00:04:44,616
If the princess knew the little
invites that you come for music...

22
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:49,610
She knows very well they are
like a penance that inflicts us

23
00:04:49,737 --> 00:04:52,896
We come here to court the
contessa Teresa Raffo...

24
00:04:52,897 --> 00:04:56,969
... for penance Mozart, two
Schubert and four Liszt

25
00:04:59,017 --> 00:05:02,008
- That appeals too - Good Evening,

26
00:05:09,097 --> 00:05:11,246
Good evening, beloved

27
00:05:11,417 --> 00:05:16,436
- What sin makes you arrives late
- The guilt is mine, princess

28
00:05:16,437 --> 00:05:19,056
I am more than convinced

29
00:05:19,057 --> 00:05:25,096
You missed a beautiful Liszt and Mozart.
Sit near me.

30
00:05:25,097 --> 00:05:28,133
She interprets Chopin very well

31
00:06:10,817 --> 00:06:15,216
I wanted to thank you,
princess, I have to leave

32
00:06:15,217 --> 00:06:18,536
Go already?  That's too bad!

33
00:06:18,537 --> 00:06:22,776
- She is an extraordinary pianist
- I think so

34
00:06:22,777 --> 00:06:24,766
Goodbye

35
00:06:45,217 --> 00:06:47,206
Where do you go?

36
00:06:47,497 --> 00:06:50,096
Stay if you are with her

37
00:06:50,097 --> 00:06:53,691
- I did not know that she would come
- Yes I know

38
00:06:54,017 --> 00:06:56,616
Farewell.  Enjoy yourself

39
00:06:56,617 --> 00:07:00,576
- Teresa, please - You come walk with me?

40
00:07:00,577 --> 00:07:02,416
I cannot, you understand

41
00:07:02,417 --> 00:07:06,616
you come out with me now, or this
is the last time that you see me...

42
00:07:06,617 --> 00:07:09,608
... the last time, and I speak seriously

43
00:07:13,777 --> 00:07:19,096
Tullio Beloved, don't forget that the
Princess invited him, if he goes

44
00:07:19,097 --> 00:07:22,133
It does not matter to me, prince

45
00:07:25,257 --> 00:07:27,326
I have an other festivity

46
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:33,736
- You want to tell Conte Egano
that I am waiting for him?

47
00:07:33,737 --> 00:07:35,726
I will Contessa

48
00:07:35,897 --> 00:07:38,330
It doesn't matter, here he is

49
00:07:38,557 --> 00:07:43,055
Stefano Beloved!  I want to go early

50
00:07:47,017 --> 00:07:49,006
Come, Tullio

51
00:07:52,457 --> 00:07:55,816
I want to go back in before
the ossessa recommences

52
00:07:55,817 --> 00:07:58,536
My wife takes much offense
if she does not see me...

53
00:07:58,537 --> 00:08:02,176
... little enough to make them happy

54
00:08:12,017 --> 00:08:14,848
Thanks

55
00:08:18,937 --> 00:08:20,416
I will return to take you later

56
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:22,816
But, why?
- I will send back the carriage...

57
00:08:22,817 --> 00:08:24,936
... I don't believe that I
will return, I am not well

58
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:29,009
I'll come with you
- Let's not complicate. Later

59
00:08:48,217 --> 00:08:50,411
Come in

60
00:08:52,097 --> 00:08:55,292
As you see I know you enough well...

61
00:08:56,897 --> 00:08:59,535
... I knew that you would come

62
00:09:00,977 --> 00:09:04,656
Ah, I would have preferred to wait
for you before leaving again...

63
00:09:04,657 --> 00:09:09,889
... more rather than to risk
finding you on my return tonight

64
00:09:10,017 --> 00:09:12,211
Give me the keys of the house

65
00:09:16,617 --> 00:09:19,536
I could not come here come with you

66
00:09:19,537 --> 00:09:23,816
My wife wanted me to accompany her
to the concert of her best friend

67
00:09:23,817 --> 00:09:26,728
Why have you not told me that
you would have gone too?

68
00:09:27,777 --> 00:09:32,816
I went just because I knew
that you would have gone

69
00:09:33,017 --> 00:09:36,372
It was time for you to face the situation.
Don't you think?

70
00:09:37,657 --> 00:09:42,856
Up to now you have succeeded,
with the ability of prestige...

71
00:09:42,857 --> 00:09:45,416
... to not understand
things as they truly are

72
00:09:45,417 --> 00:09:49,656
- and therefore I have taken the initiative
- What did you want to discover?

73
00:09:49,657 --> 00:09:53,171
That I am married?  You have always known

74
00:09:53,977 --> 00:09:56,296
- I accept - Then?

75
00:09:56,297 --> 00:09:58,576
But from what you say, is
that much of the time...

76
00:09:58,577 --> 00:10:02,216
... that the relationships between
you and your wife would be... formal

77
00:10:02,217 --> 00:10:04,616
- So they are - Not true

78
00:10:04,617 --> 00:10:08,006
Enough to see you together to see it

79
00:10:09,577 --> 00:10:14,896
You are like all the bourgeois
husbands of this world, my beloved

80
00:10:14,897 --> 00:10:17,376
You vow to the lover not to have
relationships with the wife...

81
00:10:17,377 --> 00:10:20,016
... and to the wife swear
to not have a lover

82
00:10:20,017 --> 00:10:22,576
Is it not mean, that denial

83
00:10:22,577 --> 00:10:28,332
I am a free woman, really,
not only a word... like you

84
00:10:28,457 --> 00:10:30,810
You are jealous of her?

85
00:10:32,377 --> 00:10:36,536
I do not share a man with an other woman...

86
00:10:36,537 --> 00:10:39,528
... even if she is his wife

87
00:10:40,457 --> 00:10:44,256
You do not share me with
anyone, and you know

88
00:10:44,257 --> 00:10:48,776
Do not think that I do not
have you within me, always

89
00:10:48,777 --> 00:10:53,087
That presence is made felt
continuously, obstinate...

90
00:10:53,097 --> 00:10:55,530
...even an enemy.

91
00:10:56,657 --> 00:11:03,657
You must leave. You return to your wife.
You leave me

92
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:08,333
No, I do not leave you

93
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:12,565
You remain with me

94
00:11:27,617 --> 00:11:32,576
- Still wide awake ?
- You had said that you were not well...

95
00:11:33,377 --> 00:11:37,976
Stupid me , I was worried

96
00:11:37,977 --> 00:11:41,571
I have opened the window one hundred
times in order to see you return

97
00:11:42,057 --> 00:11:46,413
See what I was doing?  I was writing to you

98
00:11:47,097 --> 00:11:49,610
But now that you are here...

99
00:11:53,417 --> 00:11:57,887
Tomorrow I leave for Florence, I do
not know how long I will be away

100
00:11:59,817 --> 00:12:03,016
This time is no laughing
matter, I must tell you

101
00:12:03,017 --> 00:12:09,933
- You go forever?
- Forever. Such a large word

102
00:12:11,937 --> 00:12:13,926
I feel, Giuliana...

103
00:12:15,457 --> 00:12:19,936
... I have not never spoken
to you of it but I am sure...

104
00:12:19,937 --> 00:12:26,937
... that some pious spirit will have
told you of my acts of infidelity to you

105
00:12:27,697 --> 00:12:33,213
I have not spoken you of it because they

106
00:12:33,297 --> 00:12:36,296
were not important and above
all because between us

107
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:41,051
...since the beginning is clearly a pact.
From our wedding

108
00:12:43,617 --> 00:12:46,216
Love is hard until ...

109
00:12:46,217 --> 00:12:50,776
... after become common affection,
esteem, friendship, interests...

110
00:12:50,777 --> 00:12:53,456
Always that it is possible, clear

111
00:12:53,457 --> 00:12:58,176
and therefore have been
because you have accepted...

112
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:03,409
... without to rebel to you, a
situation that exists from much time

113
00:13:03,417 --> 00:13:07,170
Were history without
importance, like you say

114
00:13:07,417 --> 00:13:10,692
for I have tried to ignore them,
do not give matter to us...

115
00:13:11,817 --> 00:13:15,570
- For me marriage must...
- Yes, our marriage had...

116
00:13:15,657 --> 00:13:21,056
... to be defended also
from own resentments

117
00:13:21,057 --> 00:13:24,776
and you have reason.  You are extraordinary

118
00:13:26,057 --> 00:13:28,695
although my love for you has...

119
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:33,576
... faded , as is fated to happen...

120
00:13:33,577 --> 00:13:36,656
... the affection and the
respect I have only increased

121
00:13:36,657 --> 00:13:39,215
I love you and I respect you..

122
00:13:41,337 --> 00:13:46,410
... as the sweetest sister of
which I could not make less

123
00:13:47,057 --> 00:13:50,207
I understand that you would
have the right to leave me...

124
00:13:50,777 --> 00:13:54,536
... but I would suffer
much if you abandoned me.

125
00:13:54,537 --> 00:13:56,776
I want you to continue living with me?
To help me?

126
00:13:56,777 --> 00:13:59,449
To help you?  In what sense?

127
00:14:00,417 --> 00:14:04,776
Support me.  To face a situation that...

128
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:09,565
...according to the ways of our
society, I would surely be criticized

129
00:14:09,737 --> 00:14:13,016
- the woman who I love - Teresa Raffo

130
00:14:13,017 --> 00:14:16,690
- Yes, Teresa - She is a widow, free...

131
00:14:16,737 --> 00:14:19,216
... Then what prevents you living
with her, if you have want?

132
00:14:19,217 --> 00:14:23,496
I have said to you that I love
Teresa, not that I want to marry her

133
00:14:23,497 --> 00:14:28,012
She is a sensual woman, beautiful

134
00:14:28,897 --> 00:14:30,886
I desire her

135
00:14:33,977 --> 00:14:39,368
No woman has ever succeeded in
occupying me with herself... like she

136
00:15:00,657 --> 00:15:02,694
But how would it be? I
arrive and she leaves.

137
00:15:02,695 --> 00:15:05,496
Hey, anyone home?

138
00:15:05,497 --> 00:15:07,486
Federico

139
00:15:07,937 --> 00:15:10,165
- Tullio - Federico

140
00:15:10,257 --> 00:15:13,016
I have three days of leave,
I arrive, and you leave?

141
00:15:13,017 --> 00:15:15,176
No, I go alone

142
00:15:15,177 --> 00:15:17,616
- Fortunate that you are here
- Must you go?

143
00:15:17,617 --> 00:15:20,016
Truly...  How many leave days have you?

144
00:15:20,017 --> 00:15:22,848
Three, three and half, exactly

145
00:15:23,337 --> 00:15:24,816
I feel, I...

146
00:15:24,817 --> 00:15:26,936
... I am in one situation...

147
00:15:26,937 --> 00:15:29,296
... that I do not know how to define

148
00:15:29,297 --> 00:15:31,736
I must leave and Giuliana remains alone

149
00:15:31,737 --> 00:15:33,936
I do not want to martyr her, but...

150
00:15:33,937 --> 00:15:36,856
... to only know that you
are here will calm me a lot

151
00:15:36,857 --> 00:15:42,496
I want to pass the three days in
Rome, but not with my sister-in-law

152
00:15:42,497 --> 00:15:46,256
- a delicious, adorable Creature...
- No, you can do what you want...

153
00:15:46,257 --> 00:15:48,696
... To me it is enough to
know that you are here

154
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:54,096
Enough that in the evening before going
out, you step into her apartment

155
00:15:54,097 --> 00:15:59,648
say hello and tell her what you do. She
will be content, it is a delicate gesture

156
00:16:04,977 --> 00:16:08,296
You are the only tenant in this house?
From outside it seems therefore large

157
00:16:08,297 --> 00:16:12,696
I will explain how they happen, if
it will not disappoint you too much

158
00:16:12,697 --> 00:16:15,616
I promised to show them one of the
most beautiful houses in Rome and...

159
00:16:15,617 --> 00:16:18,536
I did not say that it is not beautiful,
is very beautiful, only that...

160
00:16:18,537 --> 00:16:20,376
Not, it is not beautiful

161
00:16:20,377 --> 00:16:22,736
This villa was made to
instructions of my mother...

162
00:16:22,737 --> 00:16:25,096
... wanted trees around...

163
00:16:25,097 --> 00:16:27,056
... to see the green even
if we were in cities

164
00:16:27,057 --> 00:16:29,616
My father did all in order to please her...

165
00:16:29,617 --> 00:16:32,616
... but, died he, my mother returned to
Badiola, the house in the country...

166
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:34,976
... where there are many more
trees, much more green than here

167
00:16:34,977 --> 00:16:38,536
When my brother married, he
came here here with his wife...

168
00:16:38,537 --> 00:16:41,616
... I have held for me these three
rooms, I am really independent

169
00:16:41,617 --> 00:16:43,552
Then this is not truly your house

170
00:16:43,553 --> 00:16:47,496
Yes, yes, this is true also I assure you

171
00:16:47,497 --> 00:16:51,011
Federico!  Federico!

172
00:16:55,217 --> 00:17:00,688
Giuliana, what has happened? What
happens to you, Giuliana? answer

173
00:17:02,217 --> 00:17:04,411
Please, help me

174
00:17:05,617 --> 00:17:09,529
- I go to call the doctor
- Wait here, Gentleman

175
00:17:21,217 --> 00:17:24,776
She has not passed out.
Must have taken something

176
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:27,449
is nobody at home, you are alone?

177
00:17:27,537 --> 00:17:32,052
Not, they already have
gone to sleep except me

178
00:17:32,577 --> 00:17:38,412
I was depressed and I have taken
something in order to sleep

179
00:17:38,417 --> 00:17:40,456
and instead calming me...

180
00:17:40,457 --> 00:17:44,927
... it brought anguish, fear...

181
00:17:47,137 --> 00:17:51,976
- I did not want to remain alone
- We are here, how do you feel?

182
00:17:51,977 --> 00:17:55,816
- It is nothing, I am stupid - Feel better?

183
00:17:55,817 --> 00:17:57,932
Yes, better

184
00:17:58,617 --> 00:18:00,836
Forgive me for having disturbed you

185
00:18:00,837 --> 00:18:03,252
Do not raise you

186
00:18:04,137 --> 00:18:07,296
This is my friend Filippo
D'Arborio, he is a writer...

187
00:18:07,297 --> 00:18:10,492
... you do not think that you
had such important friends, eh?

188
00:18:11,617 --> 00:18:13,652
Ulterico Vinicci

189
00:18:14,617 --> 00:18:16,976
Signora Elviretta, my
sister-in-law Giuliana

190
00:18:16,977 --> 00:18:17,436
- Good evening

191
00:18:17,437 --> 00:18:20,496
I ask excuse all...... I
have ruined your supper...

192
00:18:20,497 --> 00:18:24,728
... return to table,
- You cannot remain alone, this evening

193
00:18:25,937 --> 00:18:27,926
Come

194
00:18:35,937 --> 00:18:39,053
When you have to sleep as I say...

195
00:18:39,297 --> 00:18:41,856
... or, you can sleep here,
rocked from our voices

196
00:18:41,857 --> 00:18:45,896
- When I was intern with Filippo...
- You were in college together!

197
00:18:45,897 --> 00:18:48,091
I was a poor boy...

198
00:18:48,417 --> 00:18:52,614
... my family did not have
sufficient means for me to study

199
00:18:52,897 --> 00:18:56,896
I lived in college, in a room
by reputation the smallest

200
00:18:56,897 --> 00:19:01,336
- next to which there was Federico
- He went to sleep before me always

201
00:19:01,337 --> 00:19:05,976
Just so, as soon as I began to
speak he fell asleep. Perhaps

202
00:19:05,977 --> 00:19:09,696
... it was the tone of my voice
that produced this effect

203
00:19:11,137 --> 00:19:14,492
it would appeal to me that also this time
it would succeed in making her sleep

204
00:19:29,777 --> 00:19:32,529
breakfast is served

205
00:20:11,217 --> 00:20:14,173
What scent!

206
00:20:14,697 --> 00:20:17,050
They are lillies?

207
00:20:18,137 --> 00:20:23,369
In this season?  How you have found them?

208
00:20:26,537 --> 00:20:28,936
How kind !

209
00:20:34,017 --> 00:20:38,168
They are from, it appears, Stefano Egano

210
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:41,409
How can you allow that imbecile?

211
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:49,689
It's not good to read the letters of others

212
00:20:52,617 --> 00:20:55,494
You are being foolish...

213
00:20:55,657 --> 00:20:59,096
... if I have wanted someone,
I would be with him, not you

214
00:20:59,097 --> 00:21:03,692
I did promise to go to see
his horses race at Cascine

215
00:21:04,257 --> 00:21:06,690
and instead I am here with you

216
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:10,245
Are you complaining?

217
00:21:19,697 --> 00:21:22,733
I hoped to see you yesterday at the races

218
00:21:23,177 --> 00:21:25,736
my horses won prizes

219
00:21:25,737 --> 00:21:27,996
There are too many people, I have had fear

220
00:21:27,997 --> 00:21:31,528
Tomorrow are the steeplechases

221
00:21:31,697 --> 00:21:37,213
I have two horses entered. I can
make them to have the major places

222
00:21:37,557 --> 00:21:40,695
I'm afraid that will not be possible for me

223
00:21:41,377 --> 00:21:45,050
In case you change your mind...

224
00:21:45,697 --> 00:21:49,165
I can assure you that Contessa
Raffo will not change her mind

225
00:21:50,457 --> 00:21:54,494
- I would like to talk to the contessa
- I explain to you, that's enough

226
00:21:57,737 --> 00:22:00,534
If you change your mind...

227
00:22:00,577 --> 00:22:02,771
She is busy

228
00:22:05,177 --> 00:22:07,166
Of course

229
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:05,056
Many friends of Egano say
that he has returned to Rome

230
00:23:05,057 --> 00:23:07,376
and also it seems

231
00:23:07,377 --> 00:23:12,290
She has broken with Tullio.
You have done well to come

232
00:23:12,537 --> 00:23:17,936
Forget those that make comments.
They do not commiserate with you

233
00:23:17,937 --> 00:23:22,376
Do not accept the role of the
betrayed and abandoned wife

234
00:23:22,377 --> 00:23:25,368
You are here in order to
demonstrate to contrary

235
00:25:18,417 --> 00:25:20,896
I hoped to arrive on time
to say not coming...

236
00:25:20,897 --> 00:25:23,330
... would have certainly come ..

237
00:25:23,457 --> 00:25:25,936
...but my train was delayed

238
00:25:28,383 --> 00:25:33,209
While I fought with some idiot in
Florence, she left saying nothing

239
00:25:33,777 --> 00:25:37,368
she wants to see again
the cost of a scandal

240
00:25:40,297 --> 00:25:43,686
She is a liar, false, unseizable

241
00:25:44,097 --> 00:25:48,576
In the moment that you feel
she is yours, she escapes

242
00:25:48,577 --> 00:25:52,967
You already feel that I am
chasing other fantasies

243
00:25:54,697 --> 00:25:57,736
I must find the strength to make
it finish, not to see her anymore

244
00:25:57,737 --> 00:25:59,886
and you must help me.

245
00:25:59,897 --> 00:26:03,889
- What I can do?
- I do not know, many things

246
00:26:04,537 --> 00:26:08,813
To remind me of my purpose not
to see her more, to convince me

247
00:26:09,537 --> 00:26:14,166
Nobody can less convince you than me

248
00:26:14,377 --> 00:26:17,896
Not true

249
00:26:17,897 --> 00:26:20,936
The most dangerous thing is the
desperation which I find, that makes...

250
00:26:20,937 --> 00:26:26,533
... me feel therefore unhappy but at
the same time renders me alive, vital

251
00:26:28,617 --> 00:26:32,415
This is the first time that I find
myself in a situation as this

252
00:26:32,817 --> 00:26:36,856
It is true that a man ends by
selling his soul for his youth

253
00:26:36,857 --> 00:26:40,056
and then finds himself
in love without defense

254
00:26:40,057 --> 00:26:43,093
You talk as if I never existed

255
00:26:46,057 --> 00:26:52,016
You have reason, I am unjust. Excuse
you must have patience with me...

256
00:26:52,017 --> 00:26:54,016
... like with a sick

257
00:26:54,017 --> 00:26:58,009
sick one that felt sorry
for it's own disease

258
00:28:35,607 --> 00:28:39,691
- Was it you singing?  - Yes

259
00:28:41,657 --> 00:28:43,276
- You go out?  - Yes.

260
00:28:43,277 --> 00:28:47,306
- Where are you going?
- To the auction of Di-Castro

261
00:29:25,377 --> 00:29:29,096
I do not succeed to pin
my veil, help me, please?

262
00:29:30,417 --> 00:29:32,406
Thanks

263
00:29:36,377 --> 00:29:39,816
You have a new scent?  What is?

264
00:29:39,817 --> 00:29:43,206
Crab-apple, an English scent

265
00:29:54,737 --> 00:29:57,011
La Fiamma

266
00:30:03,057 --> 00:30:06,696
To Giuliana Hermil, Turris
Eburnea dishonourably I offer...

267
00:30:06,697 --> 00:30:09,176
... Filippo D' Arborio - You do not leave?

268
00:30:09,177 --> 00:30:11,296
- Do you know D'Arborio?  - Yes

269
00:30:11,297 --> 00:30:15,096
- I did not know, from when?
- Your brother introduced me to him.

270
00:30:15,097 --> 00:30:20,488
- Have you read it?
- Yes, I have leafed through some pages

271
00:30:20,617 --> 00:30:22,816
He is a mediocre writer...

272
00:30:22,817 --> 00:30:25,648
... does he not seem to you?  - No

273
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:28,496
He has a haughty, emphatic style ...

274
00:30:28,497 --> 00:30:32,896
... insufferable
- How can you talk like that?

275
00:30:32,897 --> 00:30:37,256
He has an extraordinary style,
bewitching to me, like music

276
00:30:37,257 --> 00:30:42,296
you cannot judge an artist
having read only a few pages

277
00:30:42,297 --> 00:30:44,456
You take him to heart!

278
00:30:44,457 --> 00:30:48,336
He may be a great writer, like you
say, but he is badly educated...

279
00:30:48,337 --> 00:30:50,486
... this I will acknowledge to you

280
00:30:50,897 --> 00:30:54,096
The dedication that he has written
to you is not only emphatic...

281
00:30:54,097 --> 00:30:56,816
... but also inopportune if it
is believed that it is meant...

282
00:30:56,817 --> 00:31:00,456
...for a lady met a single time

283
00:31:00,497 --> 00:31:05,092
I have seen him other times
since Federico introduced me

284
00:31:06,697 --> 00:31:08,812
Take the carriage?

285
00:31:09,177 --> 00:31:11,769
No, I prefer to walk

286
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:14,606
See you later

287
00:31:27,097 --> 00:31:29,216
I have seen all

288
00:31:29,217 --> 00:31:32,296
4500 Liras and 4500 Liras twice

289
00:31:32,297 --> 00:31:35,156
- Contessa Raffo, compliments!  - Thanks

290
00:31:35,157 --> 00:31:40,735
Now a pin in dove shape.
Diamonds, rose and rubies

291
00:31:41,537 --> 00:31:45,936
Value estimated at 5-6000
we start from 1000 for this

292
00:31:45,937 --> 00:31:49,176
1000, 1100, 1400, 1600...

293
00:31:49,177 --> 00:31:52,293
... 2000, 2200 mrs.

294
00:31:53,017 --> 00:31:58,408
2400, 2800, 3000...

295
00:31:59,977 --> 00:32:04,656
... 3500 here in bottom, 4000 in
front of the bench, 4500 the mrs....

296
00:32:04,657 --> 00:32:08,096
... 5000 here.  I feel the room heating up

297
00:32:08,097 --> 00:32:12,296
Good evening, Mr. Hermil.
6000, I adjudicate to 6000...

298
00:32:12,297 --> 00:32:17,416
6500, 7000, 7500.  It makes it appeal to

299
00:32:17,417 --> 00:32:22,736
8000, 8500, 9000, 9500, 11000

300
00:32:22,737 --> 00:32:29,737
Selling for 11000, 11000 and
one and two, 11000... sold!

301
00:32:31,137 --> 00:32:36,016
Now for auction a beautiful fashionable
bracelet, of most recent invoice...

302
00:32:36,017 --> 00:32:39,696
... with more than one hundred diamonds
and sapphires, mounted in platinum

303
00:32:39,697 --> 00:32:43,016
Estimated 10000.  Start with 1000

304
00:32:43,017 --> 00:32:47,496
Who offers more? Thousands, thousand
Liras, two thousand, two thousand Liras

305
00:32:47,497 --> 00:32:50,533
-Good evening my lady - Good evening Emilio

306
00:32:52,137 --> 00:32:55,492
- Mr. Tullio is at home?
- No, my lady, he has gone out

307
00:33:04,497 --> 00:33:06,336
Tell the kitchen that I
have already had supper

308
00:33:06,337 --> 00:33:09,726
- Good night - Good night , my lady

309
00:33:55,457 --> 00:34:00,370
I have passed entire nights
downstairs, watching your windows

310
00:34:01,357 --> 00:34:06,445
I know,  I have seen you

311
00:34:08,537 --> 00:34:10,606
and you have not called me

312
00:34:12,017 --> 00:34:14,689
Why are you so cruel to me?

313
00:34:15,577 --> 00:34:20,889
You are one of those men made to suffer

314
00:34:23,177 --> 00:34:27,376
Egoist, proud...

315
00:34:27,377 --> 00:34:32,450
... controlling, and master of love

316
00:34:33,817 --> 00:34:36,536
If you knew how much it has
cost to me to resist...

317
00:34:36,537 --> 00:34:39,528
... to want to call to you

318
00:34:39,977 --> 00:34:42,126
But they have succeeded...

319
00:34:42,617 --> 00:34:46,211
... so you had to come to seek for me today

320
00:34:54,377 --> 00:34:57,336
But I did not seek for you today

321
00:34:57,337 --> 00:35:00,293
I was at home

322
00:35:01,497 --> 00:35:04,613
- it is not true - Yes, I swear to you

323
00:35:05,417 --> 00:35:08,294
I was at home from where I did not leave

324
00:35:08,497 --> 00:35:12,170
My wife has said me that she
went to the auction, and then...

325
00:35:14,817 --> 00:35:17,045
That was what your wife said?

326
00:35:17,337 --> 00:35:20,096
But she was not there, I assure you

327
00:35:20,097 --> 00:35:23,816
I did not have anything to do,
and arrived half an hour early

328
00:35:23,817 --> 00:35:27,251
I , that arrives everywhere late

329
00:35:28,057 --> 00:35:31,890
I saw all enter, one by one

330
00:35:37,057 --> 00:35:39,696
Oh God, I ruined it

331
00:35:39,697 --> 00:35:44,007
Your wife does not say the
truth to you, she deceives you

332
00:35:44,017 --> 00:35:46,928
perhaps she has a lover

333
00:35:51,137 --> 00:35:53,570
Sorry, I joke

334
00:35:56,257 --> 00:35:59,725
I have only seen people that were within

335
00:36:01,697 --> 00:36:05,052
... and I have not seen
those that arrived after

336
00:36:06,817 --> 00:36:09,648
Not after I had seen you

337
00:36:20,057 --> 00:36:22,456
- Good evening, Sir - My wife has returned?

338
00:36:22,457 --> 00:36:24,896
Yes, an hour ago, but then she has left

339
00:36:24,897 --> 00:36:29,816
She made to take the train at 20:30

340
00:36:29,817 --> 00:36:33,176
She said that she went to see
your mother in the Badiola...

341
00:36:33,177 --> 00:36:36,486
... I believe she has
left a note in the study

342
00:36:57,977 --> 00:37:00,656
Mr.Hermil, is waiting

343
00:37:00,657 --> 00:37:05,491
He is the only punctual roman,
I introduce Filippo D' Arborio

344
00:37:10,377 --> 00:37:13,208
- Tullio Hermil - D'Arborio

345
00:37:13,257 --> 00:37:15,776
- Do you make an academic bout?
- If it appeals

346
00:37:15,777 --> 00:37:17,766
- Yes - Please

347
00:37:19,817 --> 00:37:23,490
Blades in line?  Salute

348
00:37:25,937 --> 00:37:27,926
Mask...

349
00:37:30,377 --> 00:37:32,366
...on guard

350
00:37:34,617 --> 00:37:36,891
Gentlemen, to it

351
00:38:30,217 --> 00:38:32,811
Tell me if I have done well

352
00:38:33,377 --> 00:38:35,816
Who do you want next to you at table?

353
00:38:35,817 --> 00:38:39,889
To right Prince Fondi, who
you prefer on the left?

354
00:38:40,097 --> 00:38:42,769
But I do not know

355
00:38:44,937 --> 00:38:48,416
- That book  appeals to you?  - No

356
00:38:48,417 --> 00:38:52,376
To me, yes. And also the
person who has written it

357
00:38:52,377 --> 00:38:55,176
I had invited him this
evening, but he is not in Rome

358
00:38:55,177 --> 00:38:57,296
D'Arborio?

359
00:38:57,297 --> 00:39:00,492
I will see what will remake his
life, as soon as he returns

360
00:39:01,377 --> 00:39:05,416
I will organize another evening, I
want you to get to know each other

361
00:39:05,417 --> 00:39:08,816
- I know him, thanks
- So how can I have known that?

362
00:39:08,817 --> 00:39:13,446
- You are in a bad humor?  - Not at all

363
00:39:14,897 --> 00:39:19,253
Then, give your approval to
me for the table places?

364
00:39:25,497 --> 00:39:30,775
Do not forget that we must give an
answer this evening to Dampierre

365
00:39:32,097 --> 00:39:36,453
What do you say? Are we
going to Paris or not?

366
00:39:36,697 --> 00:39:39,255
It was you that was invited

367
00:39:39,777 --> 00:39:42,733
I'll go if you come also

368
00:39:43,137 --> 00:39:48,255
How many things you want me to do? To
give a lunch to D'Arborio, travels...

369
00:39:49,817 --> 00:39:56,817
To become a bachelor again and give to me

370
00:40:03,737 --> 00:40:10,737
I am here, the ambassador to my
right and Dampiere on the left...

371
00:40:11,497 --> 00:40:16,012
... Good?  - Yes, its good...

372
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:24,856
I have put Dampierre close to
me to talk about next week...

373
00:40:24,857 --> 00:40:28,291
...if we will go to Paris with them - OK

374
00:40:35,497 --> 00:40:37,486
Thanks

375
00:40:51,017 --> 00:40:53,166
Tullio

376
00:41:00,377 --> 00:41:03,368
- How are you, Giuseppe?  - Well, thanks

377
00:41:11,817 --> 00:41:14,656
- Tullio, beloved - Mother, how are you?

378
00:41:14,657 --> 00:41:18,936
You are all alike, you arrive all
at once when one least expects you

379
00:41:18,937 --> 00:41:23,009
- and Giuliana?
- Well, also she waited for you

380
00:41:28,017 --> 00:41:30,376
Where is Mrs. Giuliana?  - In the garden

381
00:41:30,377 --> 00:41:33,496
Go to call her. Tell her please
that Mr. Tullio has arrived

382
00:41:33,497 --> 00:41:35,486
Yes, my lady.

383
00:41:43,337 --> 00:41:45,896
How is Giuliana? How
does she spend her days?

384
00:41:45,897 --> 00:41:49,216
- Fortunately she has friends - Friends?

385
00:41:49,217 --> 00:41:52,016
Her friends from Rome are
staying with the Torrigiani...

386
00:41:52,017 --> 00:41:54,296
... Giuliana says that they
are likeable persons...

387
00:41:54,297 --> 00:41:59,496
... and therefore at least pass the time.
I never do go out, I see nobody

388
00:41:59,497 --> 00:42:02,370
I have said to her to invite who she
wants, but in order not to disturb,

389
00:42:02,371 --> 00:42:04,499
Giuliana goes out

390
00:42:05,579 --> 00:42:08,954
It will be a beautiful surprise
for her to find you here

391
00:42:22,737 --> 00:42:26,896
- I find You well - I was not expecting you

392
00:42:26,897 --> 00:42:29,816
To tell the truth, not even I wait for you

393
00:42:29,817 --> 00:42:33,570
I was at the station, I had
already a ticket for Paris...

394
00:42:34,017 --> 00:42:38,805
... Then I saw a train that came
here and I have changed my route

395
00:42:41,017 --> 00:42:46,010
I know that Tullio was a little
crazy, but until this point

396
00:42:47,937 --> 00:42:49,926
Wait

397
00:42:50,977 --> 00:42:54,935
Will it displease you if he
occupies a room in the left wing?

398
00:42:55,617 --> 00:42:59,616
Tullio reads until late and
keeps me wide awake...

399
00:42:59,617 --> 00:43:04,053
... therefore in order not to disturb
each other we sleep in separate rooms

400
00:43:04,417 --> 00:43:08,170
As you want, there are many rooms

401
00:43:08,657 --> 00:43:11,170
Take them there please

402
00:43:19,177 --> 00:43:22,771
- You want tea?  - No, thanks

403
00:43:25,377 --> 00:43:27,412
Thanks

404
00:43:35,937 --> 00:43:40,736
Ever been to Villalilla?
- No, I never go there

405
00:43:40,737 --> 00:43:43,936
- Like never?  - We have not been

406
00:43:43,937 --> 00:43:46,016
We will have to speak about Villalilla

407
00:43:46,017 --> 00:43:51,772
There is a former English diplomat who is
in love with it and it wants to buy it

408
00:43:52,857 --> 00:43:55,576
I said that an optimal
transaction could be made...

409
00:43:55,577 --> 00:43:59,496
... but I am contrary to sell it.
I should rent it but

410
00:43:59,497 --> 00:44:02,776
Think how much that costs ourselves...

411
00:44:02,777 --> 00:44:04,575
... when just married you
said that you wanted

412
00:44:04,576 --> 00:44:07,176
to live there six
months of the year...

413
00:44:07,177 --> 00:44:09,610
I have never thought of us there

414
00:44:10,297 --> 00:44:15,616
If I rent it we recover
expenses of maintenance

415
00:44:15,617 --> 00:44:21,486
uninhabited houses suffer
depreciation before time

416
00:44:23,657 --> 00:44:28,650
Think about it. I do
not speak for interest

417
00:44:28,897 --> 00:44:32,730
For me it will be always your house

418
00:44:34,057 --> 00:44:39,448
Mother is right, for less I
would have to go to see it

419
00:44:42,617 --> 00:44:46,415
If tomorrow you do not have
other engagements, I will go

420
00:44:52,577 --> 00:44:56,136
Welcome Sir.  Welcome Mrs.

421
00:44:56,137 --> 00:44:58,126
Hello, Callisto

422
00:45:02,017 --> 00:45:03,816
Give a drink to the horses

423
00:45:03,817 --> 00:45:04,936
and also a little graze

424
00:45:04,937 --> 00:45:08,056
For fifteen days I open the windows
to give air to the house...

425
00:45:08,057 --> 00:45:09,936
... I knew that the
gentleman was at Badiola

426
00:45:09,937 --> 00:45:14,725
I have been late to come, because
I waited for that time, so..

427
00:46:06,697 --> 00:46:09,892
Do you have to do like you told your mother

428
00:46:10,497 --> 00:46:12,612
Rent it

429
00:46:16,337 --> 00:46:20,693
Yes, would be the more reasonable thing

430
00:46:20,897 --> 00:46:24,127
If the diplomatic Englishman would take it

431
00:46:25,497 --> 00:46:27,771
I would be sorry

432
00:46:54,697 --> 00:46:56,766
Are you not very well?

433
00:48:40,697 --> 00:48:43,616
You have the same air,
halting and afraid...

434
00:48:43,617 --> 00:48:46,608
... of before the time that we have come

435
00:48:47,177 --> 00:48:52,456
here were the same flowers, same scent

436
00:48:52,457 --> 00:48:56,335
Yes, it was the same season

437
00:50:38,317 --> 00:50:43,026
Try to be two new persons,
at their first encounter

438
00:50:43,757 --> 00:50:46,395
Depend only on us...

439
00:50:47,717 --> 00:50:52,356
... if we do not succeed we
will return to our unhappiness

440
00:50:52,357 --> 00:50:54,915
... to our miseries

441
00:50:57,037 --> 00:51:01,427
It is not possible, do not torment me

442
00:51:02,157 --> 00:51:08,072
Because? You are my wife, my sister...

443
00:51:08,397 --> 00:51:10,910
... but you are never my lover

444
00:51:13,677 --> 00:51:20,388
love is not just this... above all this

445
00:51:28,197 --> 00:51:31,074
and I have not never taught you...

446
00:51:31,757 --> 00:51:36,466
... has been guilt mine, has mistaken

447
00:51:42,717 --> 00:51:48,116
Tell me that you want to
make love with me, tell me

448
00:51:48,117 --> 00:51:52,587
Tell me that you want me also, tell me

449
00:52:33,017 --> 00:52:37,350
I began to think you stayed,
I wanted to send someone

450
00:52:39,197 --> 00:52:41,710
How goes it?

451
00:52:43,757 --> 00:52:47,510
- You want me to accompany you?
- No, thanks

452
00:52:47,837 --> 00:52:49,826
Hello, mother

453
00:52:50,957 --> 00:52:56,236
Giuliana is not well, I wanted to
remain, but she did not want to

454
00:52:56,237 --> 00:52:58,516
- She is ill?  - Nothing serious...

455
00:52:58,517 --> 00:53:01,826
a light malaise, perhaps
she has caught a chill

456
00:53:03,677 --> 00:53:06,676
You are right when you say that it
is a sin to leave the villa empty

457
00:53:06,677 --> 00:53:11,716
But not for the English diplomat,
we would go to live there....

458
00:53:11,717 --> 00:53:13,356
... at least some months of the year

459
00:53:13,357 --> 00:53:15,876
- But...
- Yes... I know you don't believe me

460
00:53:15,877 --> 00:53:18,676
... But you should see. It
was there beautiful today...

461
00:53:18,677 --> 00:53:20,816
... The scent of the lillies
will be why Giuliana felt ...

462
00:53:20,817 --> 00:53:23,296
...a little unwell, the
scent went to her head

463
00:53:24,346 --> 00:53:27,636
I will go to tell Giuliana to
remain in bed, it is prudent

464
00:53:27,637 --> 00:53:29,476
I will get the doctor to come quickly

465
00:53:29,477 --> 00:53:33,150
I wanted to get him to come last
week, but Giuliana did not wish it.

466
00:53:33,437 --> 00:53:36,836
Giuseppe will not have detached
the gig yet, tell himi to go for

467
00:53:36,837 --> 00:53:39,586
... Doctor Milani, it will
please me if he comes tonight

468
00:53:39,587 --> 00:53:42,978
Calm, calm, mother, you are
exaggerating without need

469
00:53:42,979 --> 00:53:46,560
... Giuliana is well, you
worry about nothing.

470
00:53:47,837 --> 00:53:50,436
Giuliana has forbidden
me to speak to you of...

471
00:53:50,437 --> 00:53:53,956
... until we were sure, but
by now there are no doubts...

472
00:53:53,957 --> 00:53:55,716
... and I will speak to you of it ...

473
00:53:55,717 --> 00:54:01,472
... why she does not ride
the gig for that journey

474
00:54:02,917 --> 00:54:05,555
Giuliana is pregnant

475
00:54:09,157 --> 00:54:11,356
- Pregnant ?  - Yes

476
00:54:11,357 --> 00:54:12,476
She has told you?

477
00:54:12,477 --> 00:54:16,156
No, I have worked it out. She has
had many malaises, like today...

478
00:54:16,157 --> 00:54:20,596
... Nausea, dizziness, insomnia,
the things that you imagine...

479
00:54:20,597 --> 00:54:24,356
... I have asked. She has said to
me that perhaps she was pregnant...

480
00:54:24,357 --> 00:54:26,796
... but wanted to be sure of
it before speaking with you...

481
00:54:26,797 --> 00:54:29,736
... in order to not deceive you and
to not disappoint you, naturally

482
00:54:29,737 --> 00:54:32,876
I myself recommended she see the doctor...

483
00:54:32,877 --> 00:54:38,008
... because even if I tell her to take
precautions, she does not believe me

484
00:54:38,009 --> 00:54:42,997
She will be in the third month. But you,
do not betray me, wait for her to tell you

485
00:54:42,998 --> 00:54:45,566
I have asked for this
with much insistence...

486
00:54:45,567 --> 00:54:48,330
I am so happy!

487
00:54:48,331 --> 00:54:53,442
I have yearned for this moment!

488
00:54:53,443 --> 00:54:58,036
Now we must be prudent, the first
months are most dangerous...

489
00:54:58,037 --> 00:55:02,556
... above all for her, she is so  delicate,

490
00:55:02,557 --> 00:55:05,752
Beloved, our beloved creature

491
00:55:31,677 --> 00:55:34,876
Goodnight mother.  I go to sleep

492
00:55:34,877 --> 00:55:36,516
If Giuliana is awake, I hear it

493
00:55:36,517 --> 00:55:39,076
Yes, did you see the doctor?

494
00:55:39,077 --> 00:55:42,272
If Giuseppe had found him ,
he already would have arrived

495
00:55:43,957 --> 00:55:48,029
- If you have need of something
- No, thanks, goodnight

496
00:56:14,077 --> 00:56:16,351
Tullio...

497
00:56:17,277 --> 00:56:22,873
...do not go away, I fear to be alone

498
00:56:42,597 --> 00:56:47,351
you have taken something in order to sleep?

499
00:57:19,797 --> 00:57:24,676
Tullio, you have slept here all night?

500
00:57:25,437 --> 00:57:30,396
- What has happened? - you have
asked to me to remain here

501
00:57:30,517 --> 00:57:33,906
I?  When?

502
00:57:34,037 --> 00:57:35,947
You do not remember?

503
00:57:37,117 --> 00:57:41,951
I had taken a sleeping pill...

504
00:57:42,157 --> 00:57:44,756
... perhaps more than usual

505
00:57:44,757 --> 00:57:47,156
Since when do you take sleeping pills?
The doctor knows it?

506
00:57:47,157 --> 00:57:49,076
Yes

507
00:57:49,077 --> 00:57:55,197
- Show me what you take
- I do not remember where I have put it

508
00:57:55,877 --> 00:57:57,866
I waiting

509
00:58:07,797 --> 00:58:09,786
I believe..

510
00:58:11,797 --> 00:58:16,028
... I have finished all and I
have thrown out the bottle

511
00:58:18,237 --> 00:58:21,307
Is it true what my mother has said to me?

512
00:58:22,677 --> 00:58:24,871
That you are pregnant?

513
00:58:36,837 --> 00:58:38,826
Yes, it's true

514
00:58:41,797 --> 00:58:45,756
I wanted to tell you. I tried
to say it to you at Villalilla

515
00:58:45,757 --> 00:58:50,276
- For this you left Rome?
- Yes, but still I did not know

516
00:58:50,277 --> 00:58:54,349
- and he has followed you
here - followed? Who?

517
00:58:54,597 --> 00:58:58,111
We were already all ended
before I came here...

518
00:58:58,357 --> 00:59:01,109
... before I knew that I was...

519
00:59:01,317 --> 00:59:05,876
... so.  I had found the strength...

520
00:59:05,877 --> 00:59:12,877
... to overcome the loss.  I was alone, sad

521
00:59:13,277 --> 00:59:17,314
I do not want to justify
myself, or to accuse to you

522
00:59:19,517 --> 00:59:25,033
I was deprived of hope, so desparate

523
00:59:27,197 --> 00:59:31,712
But I came after, you rather...

524
00:59:35,957 --> 00:59:39,676
That which I have always said
for me, were worth also for you

525
00:59:40,757 --> 00:59:46,035
We  are two friends, two free persons

526
00:59:48,637 --> 00:59:50,476
At least you could...

527
00:59:50,477 --> 00:59:55,311
It would have not been in order to reclaim
a right, but I never thought to have

528
00:59:56,917 --> 01:00:00,385
I swore fidelity to you for always

529
01:00:01,997 --> 01:00:04,828
For you it was different...

530
01:00:05,277 --> 01:00:07,392
... but I...

531
01:00:15,997 --> 01:00:18,669
There is one thing that I want to know

532
01:00:18,877 --> 01:00:21,576
And it is uniquely important

533
01:00:21,577 --> 01:00:25,869
Our life until now does
not interest me anymore

534
01:00:25,997 --> 01:00:29,716
In these last days I have
returned from you many changes

535
01:00:29,717 --> 01:00:33,156
- and yesterday at Villalilla...
- I pray to You... You I pray

536
01:00:33,157 --> 01:00:38,796
I felt I have found you again and I
believed that you were agreed ...

537
01:00:38,797 --> 01:00:41,076
... that it would have been beautiful
to recommence all from the beginning

538
01:00:41,077 --> 01:00:45,752
For a moment I believed that
all that had happened...

539
01:00:46,277 --> 01:00:50,110
... was that not a dream, a nightmare

540
01:00:50,557 --> 01:00:55,436
It was you and I, like when we just married

541
01:00:55,437 --> 01:00:57,665
You are sincere?

542
01:01:01,077 --> 01:01:04,511
Nobody must suspect anything

543
01:01:05,437 --> 01:01:08,155
Why?

544
01:01:08,877 --> 01:01:11,396
You want that I remain with you?

545
01:01:11,397 --> 01:01:13,386
Yes

546
01:01:18,617 --> 01:01:21,289
I see that you are wide awake

547
01:01:26,777 --> 01:01:29,976
I came to tell you that I am enrolled
in the international championship

548
01:01:29,977 --> 01:01:31,756
I have need of your help. You will not
want that I dishonour the family?

549
01:01:31,757 --> 01:01:34,993
I will have to be at least well placed.
You will come down?

550
01:01:35,497 --> 01:01:37,856
- I'll catch up to you soon.
Good day, Giuliana

551
01:01:37,857 --> 01:01:40,846
Good day, Federico

552
01:01:50,617 --> 01:01:51,776
Touche, Bravo

553
01:01:51,777 --> 01:01:53,432
Why do you not go you to the
championship in my place?

554
01:01:53,433 --> 01:01:56,056
You still fence beautifully

555
01:01:56,057 --> 01:01:58,046
In guard, Tullio

556
01:02:25,777 --> 01:02:28,733
Calm boys, be careful

557
01:02:33,737 --> 01:02:36,216
What are you doing?  Are you crazy?

558
01:02:36,217 --> 01:02:40,334
Not right, tell me what's happened

559
01:02:41,097 --> 01:02:43,456
Not now, I am tired

560
01:02:43,457 --> 01:02:45,256
Boys now enough!

561
01:02:45,257 --> 01:02:49,856
The doctor is with Giuliana .
If you want to speak to him,

562
01:02:49,857 --> 01:02:51,576
All is good

563
01:02:51,577 --> 01:02:54,496
But he wants Giuliana to
remain in bed some days...

564
01:02:54,497 --> 01:02:59,096
... is more prudent. So, he
will talk to you. You go!

565
01:02:59,097 --> 01:03:02,576
No, I am sweating, I want to change...

566
01:03:02,577 --> 01:03:05,966
... I would make him wait
for me, make my excuses

567
01:03:18,857 --> 01:03:20,736
It is useless to pretend

568
01:03:20,737 --> 01:03:23,616
As you can yourself imagine,
mother has told me already

569
01:03:23,617 --> 01:03:27,416
I am really happy. Also because therefore
she will stop tormenting me...

570
01:03:27,417 --> 01:03:28,976
... to marry

571
01:03:28,977 --> 01:03:32,376
An heir has been assured. Congratulations

572
01:03:32,377 --> 01:03:34,896
Do you allow me to speak
them also to Giuliana?

573
01:03:34,897 --> 01:03:37,410
Best not now

574
01:03:37,777 --> 01:03:41,556
Better Mother had kept quiet.
Giuliana is not well

575
01:03:41,557 --> 01:03:43,636
It is probable that she will not
carry this pregnancy through

576
01:03:43,637 --> 01:03:46,529
But the doctor?  What does he feel?

577
01:03:46,937 --> 01:03:49,776
There was another time, when
Giuliana was pregnant...

578
01:03:49,777 --> 01:03:52,369
... a little after we were married...

579
01:03:52,457 --> 01:03:55,049
... said that all was good

580
01:03:55,337 --> 01:03:57,611
and it did not go at all well

581
01:04:02,057 --> 01:04:04,456
If you left suddenly, against
the advice of the doctor well,

582
01:04:04,457 --> 01:04:06,295
... my mother would make a tragedy.
Therefore

583
01:04:06,296 --> 01:04:09,132
you will remain
here for some days

584
01:04:09,177 --> 01:04:12,016
I meanwhile will go to Rome to
speak with Professor Magli...

585
01:04:12,017 --> 01:04:13,936
... and to prepare all

586
01:04:13,937 --> 01:04:17,371
However I will have to ask some details...

587
01:04:17,937 --> 01:04:21,216
- In what month are you?
- I have ended the second...

588
01:04:21,217 --> 01:04:23,136
... a few days ago

589
01:04:23,137 --> 01:04:26,128
For how much of it I know,
it is not still dangerous...

590
01:04:26,217 --> 01:04:28,889
... if  due precautions are taken

591
01:04:30,457 --> 01:04:33,095
I do not understand

592
01:04:34,017 --> 01:04:37,096
My love, you do not want to
carry the pregnancy ahead?

593
01:04:37,097 --> 01:04:40,816
you have already had a miscarriage...

594
01:04:40,817 --> 01:04:43,887
... and that will make a
second pass unnoticed

595
01:04:44,657 --> 01:04:48,296
I speak for my mother, my brother and
for all those that I know already

596
01:04:48,297 --> 01:04:50,536
To professor Magli I know what I must say

597
01:04:50,537 --> 01:04:52,652
But I cannot

598
01:04:54,657 --> 01:04:57,966
- you cannot what?  - I cannot

599
01:05:00,537 --> 01:05:05,496
Because you cannot? Why you have
fear or because you do not want?

600
01:05:07,537 --> 01:05:10,175
I cannot because it is a crime

601
01:05:23,457 --> 01:05:25,492
A crime?

602
01:05:27,097 --> 01:05:29,530
How can you think that I...?

603
01:05:30,497 --> 01:05:33,016
While you can calmly give my name,...

604
01:05:33,017 --> 01:05:36,896
... my affection to a stranger

605
01:05:36,897 --> 01:05:39,967
This for you is not a crime?

606
01:05:44,097 --> 01:05:46,246
Why do you not answer

607
01:05:49,617 --> 01:05:52,812
I have said that I want to help you

608
01:05:55,977 --> 01:06:00,096
I love you and I do not have
rancour for what you have done

609
01:06:00,097 --> 01:06:03,696
I am grateful to you, very grateful, but...

610
01:06:03,697 --> 01:06:05,686
But what?

611
01:06:13,577 --> 01:06:15,736
you have said that is history...

612
01:06:15,737 --> 01:06:19,570
... those refusals, that you
do not want to remember

613
01:06:20,297 --> 01:06:24,296
are not true, because
if therefore it were...

614
01:06:24,297 --> 01:06:28,776
... as you can think that...?
- Impossible, in fact. I recognize

615
01:06:28,777 --> 01:06:32,616
I must always allow you.

616
01:06:32,617 --> 01:06:38,088
Giuliana , the true crime
is what you want to commit

617
01:06:38,937 --> 01:06:42,376
Before the remorse of having been
with another man torments you

618
01:06:42,377 --> 01:06:46,376
... But of this guilt you
acquit yourself alone...

619
01:06:46,377 --> 01:06:49,176
... and begin to torment to you instead for
the consequences of the relationship...

620
01:06:49,177 --> 01:06:52,536
... and conditions acquittal with such
a hard punishment all the life...

621
01:06:52,537 --> 01:06:58,657
... not only for you. You see
the absurdity of your behavior?

622
01:07:00,057 --> 01:07:02,285
I am atheist...

623
01:07:02,337 --> 01:07:06,336
... That does not mean that I do
not have moral problems, indeed

624
01:07:06,337 --> 01:07:09,496
I face them with full knowledge
of all that it involves

625
01:07:09,497 --> 01:07:13,016
Because I do not delegate to divinity
the decision of what is right

626
01:07:13,017 --> 01:07:16,736
I Assume awareness of the responsibility...

627
01:07:16,737 --> 01:07:22,606
... I know that my sins if sins I have...

628
01:07:22,697 --> 01:07:25,016
... are not redeemed with repentance...

629
01:07:25,017 --> 01:07:28,008
... or the inflicting  of punishments

630
01:07:28,017 --> 01:07:30,370
I am a free man

631
01:07:30,457 --> 01:07:35,052
the earth is my single country
because it does not live temporarily

632
01:07:35,257 --> 01:07:37,936
my story begins and ends here...

633
01:07:37,937 --> 01:07:40,656
... I do not have a hell to fear...

634
01:07:40,657 --> 01:07:42,856
... neither heaven in which to hope

635
01:07:42,857 --> 01:07:46,576
Secondly we can only count on ourselves

636
01:07:46,577 --> 01:07:49,966
that is not a comfortable
solution that I propose to you...

637
01:07:50,137 --> 01:07:55,096
... a solution that faces the
truth of the existence...

638
01:08:06,097 --> 01:08:08,936
... that it is not
sheltered in the faith...

639
01:08:08,937 --> 01:08:12,176
... of a God manifactured
from our fantasy...

640
01:08:12,177 --> 01:08:15,771
... and of another life that
assigns the prize or pain

641
01:08:21,937 --> 01:08:24,768
If I could think like you...

642
01:08:26,897 --> 01:08:29,728
... to have your security

643
01:08:31,257 --> 01:08:36,170
To live in fundamental freedom...

644
01:08:37,337 --> 01:08:39,326
... without fears

645
01:08:40,697 --> 01:08:46,327
Reflect, it is for you to decide

646
01:09:04,577 --> 01:09:08,489
However, tomorrow I go to to you Rome
and I arrange all as I have said

647
01:09:11,737 --> 01:09:14,170
You come after me soon

648
01:09:15,457 --> 01:09:17,856
you must do me a favour

649
01:09:20,097 --> 01:09:23,696
you must let me meet your
friend Filippo D'Arborio

650
01:09:23,697 --> 01:09:26,972
and I must go to Rome for this?

651
01:09:27,417 --> 01:09:31,696
If you write a letter, he will
be happy to come, we are friends

652
01:09:31,697 --> 01:09:35,656
He will run, with the hope
of seeing Giuliana again

653
01:09:35,657 --> 01:09:39,176
They met one evening at my house
and was as if struck by lightning

654
01:09:39,177 --> 01:09:41,849
when he took her for a walk...

655
01:09:42,737 --> 01:09:45,250
I do not want to invite him, I want...

656
01:09:45,537 --> 01:09:49,136
... to see him at your house.
You invite him

657
01:09:49,137 --> 01:09:51,695
and I will visit your house

658
01:09:53,337 --> 01:09:56,612
It is a delicate matter which
I cannot explain to you

659
01:10:05,697 --> 01:10:09,576
The mistake is mine. With this
warmth, we said to ourselves...

660
01:10:09,577 --> 01:10:12,693
... that the gentleman will
not come back for sure

661
01:10:13,577 --> 01:10:16,576
and since there was need, one
covered up downstairs...

662
01:10:16,577 --> 01:10:21,695
... to make to beat the carpets,
therefore I have thought...

663
01:10:28,737 --> 01:10:30,886
I want you to replace them

664
01:10:30,937 --> 01:10:33,575
In about a week Madam arrives

665
01:10:36,137 --> 01:10:41,369
- Who is in house? - the
cook, Virginia, Alfredo...

666
01:10:47,937 --> 01:10:50,495
Sir has instructions?

667
01:10:54,297 --> 01:10:56,136
Like?

668
01:10:56,137 --> 01:10:59,376
Ah yes, I have need someone
to deliver a telegram

669
01:10:59,377 --> 01:11:04,256
I will send the coachman
or if you want, I will go

670
01:11:13,137 --> 01:11:16,207
OK I call when it's ready

671
01:11:42,697 --> 01:11:44,096
Then?

672
01:11:44,097 --> 01:11:47,999
I would have caught up to You, as I wrote
to you and as I have telegraphed to you...

673
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,998
Not even for a moment I have thought
that you would be returned so soon

674
01:11:50,999 --> 01:11:52,536
you are contradicting yourself

675
01:11:52,537 --> 01:11:55,408
you had thought of us

676
01:11:55,409 --> 01:11:58,332
In fact today you have sent the
waiter here, then to Paris

677
01:11:58,333 --> 01:12:02,576
I was not in anxiety, I did not have
your news, before I started my journey

678
01:12:02,577 --> 01:12:04,296
You want to make me believe

679
01:12:04,297 --> 01:12:06,816
... that you wanted truly
to catch up to me to Paris?

680
01:12:06,817 --> 01:12:12,095
- No - you see?  I have done good to return

681
01:12:12,377 --> 01:12:18,132
I believe that the truth never
does not say itself to four eyes

682
01:12:18,737 --> 01:12:23,456
So many factors takes part in
the intimate relations, and...

683
01:12:23,457 --> 01:12:27,767
... most times nothing is understood more

684
01:12:29,817 --> 01:12:34,207
- But to understand what?
- That for you it is finished, my beloved

685
01:12:35,977 --> 01:12:38,171
Time for the truth...

686
01:12:40,457 --> 01:12:42,526
...  soon

687
01:12:47,137 --> 01:12:52,335
It is not beautiful for a woman to be left

688
01:12:52,937 --> 01:12:58,294
There are those ready companions
and they do not appeal to me

689
01:12:58,457 --> 01:13:01,616
There are those that will put
in doubt her fascination

690
01:13:01,617 --> 01:13:04,016
and this does not please me

691
01:13:04,177 --> 01:13:07,176
You sent me a note when I was
already on the train, saying...

692
01:13:07,177 --> 01:13:10,213
... that serious transactions of family...

693
01:13:13,297 --> 01:13:18,176
Not even an employee of the land
registery would use such little words

694
01:13:18,377 --> 01:13:22,733
has sincerely believed, to a catastrophe

695
01:13:24,057 --> 01:13:28,493
I wanted to go to Paris, yes,
in order to amuse myself

696
01:13:28,937 --> 01:13:32,936
I arrived in Paris and I
have not even unpacked

697
01:13:32,937 --> 01:13:36,776
I am returned immediately, I
thought that you had problems...

698
01:13:36,777 --> 01:13:39,495
... you would intend to have come to me

699
01:13:40,537 --> 01:13:43,528
my friends will laugh for sure...

700
01:13:43,737 --> 01:13:48,889
... when I will tell the
history to them of my defeat

701
01:13:51,897 --> 01:13:56,173
What you say ? You still want
to have supper together?

702
01:13:56,777 --> 01:13:58,926
As you prefer

703
01:13:59,057 --> 01:14:02,176
- No compliments - Please, Teresa...

704
01:14:02,177 --> 01:14:06,055
... You are only person in the world to
which I will perhaps be able to say...

705
01:14:10,097 --> 01:14:14,214
has left me. I hope that there
is not another day, for us

706
01:14:50,497 --> 01:14:54,256
Good evening.  I ask to excuse

707
01:14:54,257 --> 01:14:57,566
My brother Federico, Contessa Raffo

708
01:14:58,257 --> 01:15:01,696
Contessa. Osvaldo has said
to me that you were here

709
01:15:01,697 --> 01:15:06,256
You are upset.  Insomnia,near enough

710
01:15:06,257 --> 01:15:09,816
I have gone to do what you know,
but have not found my friend

711
01:15:09,817 --> 01:15:12,776
I did not seen him again
before he left for the field

712
01:15:12,777 --> 01:15:16,536
I did not know not even that he
had gone to Africa. In Africa,

713
01:15:16,537 --> 01:15:21,132
to do what? Now he is found
in isolation in hospital

714
01:15:21,217 --> 01:15:26,335
He has been taken by a very serious disease

715
01:15:28,017 --> 01:15:31,256
also you perhaps know my friend

716
01:15:31,257 --> 01:15:33,994
- writer Filippo D' Arborio
- I was introduced to him

717
01:15:33,995 --> 01:15:36,416
I am one of his admirers

718
01:15:37,297 --> 01:15:40,056
He is between life and
death, they have said to me

719
01:15:40,057 --> 01:15:42,896
The truth is that they understand
nothing of tropical diseases...

720
01:15:42,897 --> 01:15:47,287
... To the danger of the disease add
that too many do not know how to cure it

721
01:15:47,897 --> 01:15:49,496
Sad news

722
01:15:49,497 --> 01:15:54,376
I am sorry to be bearer of these... indeed

723
01:15:54,777 --> 01:15:56,536
Come to me when you go

724
01:15:56,537 --> 01:15:58,976
We will meet tomorrow, too late tonight

725
01:15:58,977 --> 01:16:02,336
You come to me, I will wait for you
- As you wish

726
01:16:02,337 --> 01:16:04,326
Good night

727
01:16:11,177 --> 01:16:13,256
Know what I say to you?

728
01:16:13,257 --> 01:16:15,815
I suffer less than how much you believed

729
01:16:16,737 --> 01:16:20,456
Perhaps will come a day I will
listen what you have to tell me

730
01:16:25,937 --> 01:16:27,926
What's happening?

731
01:16:33,137 --> 01:16:35,776
- Nothing - What nothing?

732
01:16:35,777 --> 01:16:40,611
the door was open . You said
to me to come to any hour

733
01:16:41,057 --> 01:16:43,536
Ah yes, I wanted...

734
01:16:43,777 --> 01:16:46,736
... I wanted to know in what
hospital is D'Arborio recovering

735
01:16:46,737 --> 01:16:51,525
In the Policlinico block, they
do not allow approach to anybody

736
01:16:51,537 --> 01:16:54,687
Now you must explain to
me what you want from him

737
01:16:54,897 --> 01:16:57,016
When you asked me to know it...

738
01:16:57,017 --> 01:16:58,496
... I do not hide to you
that I have thought

739
01:16:58,497 --> 01:17:00,096
you feared that there was
something between...

740
01:17:00,097 --> 01:17:01,896
... D'Arborio and Teresa Raffo

741
01:17:01,897 --> 01:17:06,456
Logical , in as much as all the
gentlemen of Rome of are in love

742
01:17:06,457 --> 01:17:11,296
On the other part, your Teresa Raffo,
without offenses, of course...

743
01:17:11,297 --> 01:17:14,976
... are not at all type to refuse a whim

744
01:17:14,977 --> 01:17:18,936
and instead nothing. They are
informed to me, who meet her

745
01:17:18,937 --> 01:17:20,776
She has seeen only you...

746
01:17:20,777 --> 01:17:23,376
... did not know not
even that you were sick

747
01:17:23,377 --> 01:17:25,256
and so?  What are all these mysteries?

748
01:17:25,257 --> 01:17:28,930
I cannot tell you anything

749
01:17:31,577 --> 01:17:35,171
Is a issue that regards a personal friend

750
01:17:35,257 --> 01:17:39,215
Beh, I go to sleep, day is made, by now

751
01:17:39,897 --> 01:17:42,016
at least tell me when...

752
01:17:42,017 --> 01:17:44,976
... when he has left for Africa

753
01:17:44,977 --> 01:17:49,576
I inquire myself, but advise
your friend to leave it in peace

754
01:17:49,577 --> 01:17:53,936
D'Arborio is ill, very ill. He
is a man who deserves respect

755
01:17:53,937 --> 01:17:57,451
He is not only a great
writer also he is an angel

756
01:17:57,857 --> 01:18:02,133
the only person , thinking next
to which I have a sense of shame

757
01:18:05,017 --> 01:18:06,832
because?

758
01:18:06,833 --> 01:18:09,496
It is those thoughts makes
us understand us, even you

759
01:18:09,497 --> 01:18:14,896
We are intelligent, we have
travelled, we have studied...

760
01:18:14,897 --> 01:18:18,411
... we amuse ourselves well
therefore, we are rich...

761
01:18:18,697 --> 01:18:22,816
... and then?
- That piffle you are saying?

762
01:18:22,817 --> 01:18:24,776
I do not know even that.  Goodnight

763
01:18:24,777 --> 01:18:29,770
At what time are we going to the circle?
You must fight me again

764
01:18:30,577 --> 01:18:32,566
I do not know

765
01:18:32,977 --> 01:18:34,736
I do not know what happens tomorrow

766
01:18:34,737 --> 01:18:37,728
- Goodnight - Goodnight

767
01:19:12,937 --> 01:19:16,936
Good day. Mrs. Giuliana has
need of lighter clothes...

768
01:19:16,937 --> 01:19:21,296
... and has sent me to take them.
The weather is warm in Badiola

769
01:19:21,297 --> 01:19:24,296
mrs. has not said to you that she will
come in the next few days to Rome?

770
01:19:24,297 --> 01:19:26,286
No, Sir

771
01:19:27,697 --> 01:19:30,050
My excuses, my head!

772
01:19:32,737 --> 01:19:34,772
These are from Mrs.

773
01:19:50,537 --> 01:19:53,767
I have some jobs to do
on behalf of your mother

774
01:19:56,217 --> 01:20:00,496
I hope to be able to leave this evening,
if the gentleman has instructions...

775
01:20:00,497 --> 01:20:03,772
No, not anything, I will arrive before

776
01:20:04,017 --> 01:20:06,576
I cannot do what you ask me

777
01:20:06,577 --> 01:20:09,568
I prefer to go, to disappear
from your life...

778
01:20:09,577 --> 01:20:12,408
... but I cannot commit a crime

779
01:20:13,417 --> 01:20:15,656
- I have spoken about it also ...
- With who have you spoken of it ?

780
01:20:15,657 --> 01:20:18,090
With my priest

781
01:20:22,297 --> 01:20:24,256
Has it been him that advised
you to go through with it?

782
01:20:24,257 --> 01:20:27,248
He approves of it, but he has let me decide

783
01:20:27,897 --> 01:20:31,650
I hope that he will help to
give my name to the child

784
01:20:34,617 --> 01:20:36,296
and why not its father?

785
01:20:36,297 --> 01:20:39,174
He does not know anything
neither must he know it

786
01:20:40,057 --> 01:20:42,729
Is that true or do you say words?

787
01:20:45,857 --> 01:20:49,496
you know what it will happen
if you decide to leave me?

788
01:20:50,017 --> 01:20:53,656
It is not important to me, none
of the scandal, that's very clear

789
01:20:54,097 --> 01:20:56,296
But your situation as a single woman...

790
01:20:56,297 --> 01:21:01,176
... that has deceived to save its
child depriving it of father

791
01:21:01,417 --> 01:21:04,456
Be sure that your decision is
dictated only from yours...

792
01:21:04,457 --> 01:21:08,574
... religion, or morals,
call them as you want...

793
01:21:09,977 --> 01:21:13,013
... if I felt you were mine only mine...

794
01:21:14,537 --> 01:21:17,334
... I could support anything

795
01:21:21,617 --> 01:21:24,847
the sons are of him who
educates them and raises them

796
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:15,879
Hello?  Good day madam, it is nine o'clock

797
01:22:15,880 --> 01:22:19,633
Come, come, I'm wide awake

798
01:23:16,760 --> 01:23:18,875
have you seen it

799
01:23:25,080 --> 01:23:28,310
It was known in Rome that
he was seriously sick

800
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:33,794
You have nothing to  say?  strange

801
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:40,429
What!

802
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:45,313
I would have sworn you
would have said about it

803
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,752
One disease taken in Africa?

804
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:13,875
Why you do not look at me?

805
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:17,789
What are you thinking?

806
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:25,436
Why do you torment yourself

807
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:55,749
Here is the doctor

808
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:02,669
I'll go meet him

809
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:09,479
Good evening, is the
obstetrician here already?

810
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:11,469
Yes

811
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:19,475
Come with me doctor

812
01:25:21,240 --> 01:25:23,759
The doctor has come, the doctor!

813
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:27,911
- He comes at last, - doctor.
I must say one thing

814
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:32,271
and want to declare it
in presence of my mother

815
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:34,679
the last time that you visited my wife...

816
01:25:34,680 --> 01:25:38,797
... you said to me that an
alternative could be introduced

817
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:42,599
It is very clear, and I assume
all the responsibility for it...

818
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:45,679
... that if this unfortunate
circumstance were to occur...

819
01:25:45,680 --> 01:25:47,959
... we want to save the life of the mother

820
01:25:47,960 --> 01:25:51,959
I hope that we will not face this choice

821
01:25:51,960 --> 01:25:56,079
We are grateful however of being
exempt from all responsibility

822
01:25:56,080 --> 01:26:00,119
- I know that the catholic religion...
- I know. No there is no need

823
01:26:00,120 --> 01:26:03,999
It is an immoral, criminal law.
I do not regard it

824
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,399
Come doctor

825
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:53,279
Breaths

826
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:57,238
Good, long breaths

827
01:26:58,320 --> 01:27:00,389
Calm

828
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:03,870
So , good

829
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:12,749
Mr. Tullio!  Mr. Tullio!

830
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:20,159
Mr. Tullio!  Mr. Tullio it's a boy

831
01:27:20,160 --> 01:27:22,673
he has already opened his eyes

832
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:26,479
here safe and sound both.  we have done

833
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:29,919
Compliments.  A most beautiful child

834
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:31,759
All has gone well

835
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:35,319
Go also to the Madam, but do
not let anybody enter the room

836
01:27:35,320 --> 01:27:38,879
She had a fleeting crisis. She
is well, but she is very weak

837
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:42,399
It is nothing, do not worry.

838
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:46,039
Yes, insomnia has one curious
psychical reaction...

839
01:27:46,040 --> 01:27:50,350
... do not want to see the child, cry

840
01:28:28,040 --> 01:28:32,476
How beautiful! God bless him

841
01:28:33,080 --> 01:28:38,631
Raimondo, Raimondo, of grandmother

842
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:55,719
Tell the truth! he is not the most
beautiful child of the world?

843
01:28:55,720 --> 01:28:58,679
Look at the eyes, I pray you make
a good impression of your uncle

844
01:28:58,680 --> 01:29:02,679
Don't cry, treasure. Nothing
but to eat and to sleep

845
01:29:02,680 --> 01:29:06,599
Look at the hands. It comes high, eh?
But how beautiful ,eh?

846
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:10,639
Like all the babies. The
foals distinguish themselves

847
01:29:10,640 --> 01:29:12,994
- You saw what has been born to Zara - Beh?

848
01:29:12,995 --> 01:29:15,399
Gray silver, one splendor.  But a child...

849
01:29:15,400 --> 01:29:18,759
you say that in order to make me angry.
What do you know of children?

850
01:29:18,760 --> 01:29:21,719
When you had been born you were most ugly.
Red, wrinkled...

851
01:29:21,720 --> 01:29:25,234
... you were not at all like he.

852
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:28,079
Talk to Tullio, instead of making humour

853
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:31,079
You must say: Tullio your son
is as beautiful as the sun

854
01:29:31,080 --> 01:29:33,319
- That must say I?  - Yes

855
01:29:33,320 --> 01:29:38,029
Nanny, you close the windows against
the cold, it is an ugly day

856
01:29:40,040 --> 01:29:44,239
You have fear of saying to him that
the foal is better than Raimondo?

857
01:29:44,240 --> 01:29:48,879
Don't worry, Mother. I will say
that never has a wonder similar

858
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:51,518
been seen and that he is
proud of coming from father

859
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:53,599
Who is?

860
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:58,999
You joke, but I am deprived
of hope, deprived of hope

861
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:03,356
- But what do you say?
- But you do not have any idea

862
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:07,119
I do not take with Giuliana why
she has told the doctor...

863
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:10,959
... it was the reaction
to the state of tension

864
01:30:10,960 --> 01:30:14,918
But your brother! So strange!

865
01:30:15,800 --> 01:30:19,519
Before he was taking care for
her, and can understand it...

866
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:22,112
... but now that all has gone well

867
01:30:22,840 --> 01:30:25,637
Do you know that he never
looked at the child?

868
01:30:26,600 --> 01:30:30,990
Like if it did not exist,
nor even speak of it

869
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:36,512
only thing that your brother
has known tells me..

870
01:30:36,680 --> 01:30:40,679
... is that if we want to christen
it, we do it on our behalf...

871
01:30:40,680 --> 01:30:43,919
... without receptions, nothing

872
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:47,070
you had made me scared, that's all?

873
01:30:47,080 --> 01:30:50,959
You know that Tullio is not religious.
He has his ideas

874
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:54,199
You want to say that the reception
we will make on an other occasion

875
01:30:54,200 --> 01:30:57,191
- You care about this?  - Yes, a lot

876
01:30:57,280 --> 01:30:59,508
and above all

877
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:04,519
Always blocks from him about that...
Hostile

878
01:31:04,520 --> 01:31:06,999
But no, these are good news

879
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,719
For a while we will not have
the trouble of reception

880
01:31:09,720 --> 01:31:13,279
and then Tullio and Giuliana
come to agreement...

881
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:15,038
... and are forgotting
even they have a son.

882
01:31:15,039 --> 01:31:16,919
On, then all will be well

883
01:31:16,920 --> 01:31:22,239
Tullio will come into church,
good like when he married

884
01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:25,959
and Raimondo, it is decided that
Raimondo he will be called?

885
01:32:09,960 --> 01:32:13,319
Your crazy husband has has decided
to make mother deprived of hope

886
01:32:13,320 --> 01:32:17,756
It was better if you did not come, if you
had to make that apparition from devil

887
01:32:18,120 --> 01:32:21,919
I have said to mother and the nanny to
come to drink a little champagne...

888
01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:24,319
... therefore calm down

889
01:32:24,600 --> 01:32:27,279
Are champagne,  not holy water

890
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:29,599
Come in

891
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:35,599
Oh!  Bravo, come, come

892
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,911
No, not here, go

893
01:32:41,720 --> 01:32:45,314
Giuliana must not be made tired.
You go also

894
01:32:47,978 --> 01:32:48,724
Let's go, Federico

895
01:32:48,725 --> 01:32:52,670
Indeed, does it not please you if
we are here with you, Giuliana?

896
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:58,199
The doctor has said that if you can move
little, the effort would do you good

897
01:32:58,200 --> 01:33:00,872
Come, make an effort

898
01:33:00,880 --> 01:33:03,239
-Come away, Federico - For me

899
01:33:03,240 --> 01:33:06,276
Go on, see you later

900
01:33:17,080 --> 01:33:19,679
I want to prepare a beautiful
christmas to make peace with mother

901
01:33:19,680 --> 01:33:22,352
You have some ideas

902
01:33:22,840 --> 01:33:25,796
Do not count on me, I won't be here

903
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:28,679
So? You do not remain
here for the festivities?

904
01:33:28,680 --> 01:33:29,799
Mother has told me for sure

905
01:33:29,800 --> 01:33:33,553
I am sorry to disappoint her
but I have changed my mind

906
01:33:33,560 --> 01:33:35,549
I do not make it

907
01:33:37,280 --> 01:33:40,669
There is an atmosphere here,
than does not appeal to me

908
01:33:41,400 --> 01:33:44,879
I wish well to all, but
I too have my problems

909
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:48,919
and I need to pass the few days
leave that I have peacefully

910
01:33:48,920 --> 01:33:51,592
I will celebrate elsewhere

911
01:33:56,600 --> 01:33:58,510
He has fed

912
01:34:00,840 --> 01:34:03,751
I hoped to find him awake

913
01:34:06,160 --> 01:34:10,550
He is well covered? It seems
to me that he has cold hands

914
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:14,399
- Shall we put his mittens on?
- No, no, Madam, do not worry

915
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:16,753
...he is beautifully warm

916
01:34:18,280 --> 01:34:20,359
He is fast asleep, do not have fear

917
01:34:20,360 --> 01:34:22,559
It is soothing for children
to hear our voices...

918
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:25,596
... to know that are not alone

919
01:34:29,960 --> 01:34:32,279
I am going to sleep also , goodnight

920
01:34:32,280 --> 01:34:34,793
Goodnight, Madam.

921
01:34:52,080 --> 01:34:56,277
Nights I spy on you and that
I see you goto cosset it

922
01:34:56,880 --> 01:35:00,439
Scream to the four winds
what you want , do not lie

923
01:35:00,440 --> 01:35:03,351
have at least the courage to say truth

924
01:35:06,920 --> 01:35:09,959
I have come here because
I seemed to feel a call

925
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:11,399
This has happened other times to me

926
01:35:11,400 --> 01:35:13,999
I seem to feel a call as
if something had happened

927
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:17,479
It is not true, you were seen also
when you get up hidden in the dark...

928
01:35:17,480 --> 01:35:20,839
... trying not to make noise
- What bad have I done?

929
01:35:20,840 --> 01:35:25,071
Also you come here in the
night, the nanny has told me

930
01:35:29,920 --> 01:35:33,195
It's true, it's true

931
01:35:33,320 --> 01:35:35,399
But it is not the same thing

932
01:35:35,400 --> 01:35:38,479
I try to discover your
secret by watching you

933
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:42,959
I try to overcome, to forget.
But I do not succeed!

934
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:45,359
Cursed be the day on which
I accepted this torture

935
01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:49,839
You are not the same as when he is there.
You are happy!

936
01:35:49,840 --> 01:35:53,559
So why do I not satiate
myself here to watch

937
01:35:54,600 --> 01:35:57,795
and you are not the cure for my suffering

938
01:35:57,960 --> 01:36:04,080
You I do love, and loving him
you think and love his father

939
01:36:06,560 --> 01:36:08,879
You know that is not true

940
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:13,673
I have even wished that
he died when he was born

941
01:36:14,280 --> 01:36:17,430
That is horrible, but is so

942
01:36:19,120 --> 01:36:21,997
Also I feel anguish in his presence

943
01:36:22,880 --> 01:36:28,078
Yes, I also hate him for the
suffering he brings to me

944
01:36:29,120 --> 01:36:32,680
You cannot see that, why
do you not believe me?

945
01:36:33,080 --> 01:36:36,196
It's true, I hate him.  I swear

946
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:42,034
You think thus?

947
01:36:57,200 --> 01:37:00,879
Yes, because he has been put between us...

948
01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:03,598
... and I would want that you and I...

949
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:23,879
Let's go away. We will
be happy away from here

950
01:37:25,040 --> 01:37:29,191
We will leave after Christmas.
I promise you

951
01:37:36,480 --> 01:37:38,519
Mother is downstairs.  We go to mass

952
01:37:38,520 --> 01:37:42,557
- Fine. I will wait for to you here
- Your cape, madam.

953
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:49,111
Take that away.  You do not wear my gift?

954
01:37:49,200 --> 01:37:52,479
It does not seem the right
event, it is too opulent

955
01:37:52,480 --> 01:37:58,600
Nonsense, it pleases the peasants
to see their masters well dressed.

956
01:38:00,720 --> 01:38:04,999
The bells have already played twice Madam!

957
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:06,989
We must hurry. - I am coming

958
01:39:40,840 --> 01:39:43,999
Nanny, you can go to mass if you want.
I remain here

959
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:48,390
Thank you, Sir. I will go.
The child is fast asleep.

960
01:40:06,520 --> 01:40:10,193
Goodnight, Sir.  Happy Christmas

961
01:40:10,200 --> 01:40:12,269
Goodnight

962
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:24,039
Giuseppe, serve supper immediately

963
01:44:24,040 --> 01:44:26,439
Of course,Madam...Immediately

964
01:44:39,480 --> 01:44:43,278
and so this Christmas is passed

965
01:44:47,760 --> 01:44:52,958
and we will leave here, as we have promised

966
01:44:53,080 --> 01:44:57,038
After Christmas, but when?

967
01:44:57,440 --> 01:45:01,910
When you want, tomorrow even

968
01:45:05,960 --> 01:45:10,319
- Madam!  Madam!  - What is it?

969
01:45:10,320 --> 01:45:13,470
- Come. The child does not breathe
- My God!

970
01:45:39,800 --> 01:45:44,509
He does not breathe!  My God !?

971
01:45:44,640 --> 01:45:48,916
Oh my God !  Oh my God!

972
01:45:52,920 --> 01:45:58,835
I do not want you to go in there

973
01:45:59,480 --> 01:46:01,708
Why?

974
01:46:02,400 --> 01:46:08,315
Stay with me, I am so afraid.

975
01:46:10,760 --> 01:46:12,795
Come

976
01:46:21,200 --> 01:46:24,156
Mr. Hermil, Mr. Hermil!

977
01:46:49,280 --> 01:46:55,115
No!  It is not true!  It is not true!!

978
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:12,112
He is dead?

979
01:47:14,360 --> 01:47:16,395
Yes

980
01:47:18,280 --> 01:47:21,271
Get off, do not touch me

981
01:47:21,880 --> 01:47:27,679
- I am not your accomplice
- Be quiet, Giuliana, I beg you

982
01:47:27,680 --> 01:47:31,239
- It is you
- Why do you say this? You knew all

983
01:47:31,240 --> 01:47:34,039
The guilt is yours, yours. I hate you

984
01:47:34,040 --> 01:47:37,399
Not, you have also said you hate him

985
01:47:37,400 --> 01:47:41,519
No, I wanted to save him, with
all my strength, from you

986
01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:44,399
- All I have done in order to save him
- But what are you saying

987
01:47:44,400 --> 01:47:49,319
Yes, everything I have done with you,
I have only done in order to save him

988
01:47:49,320 --> 01:47:52,439
and now, and for the rest of my days...

989
01:47:52,440 --> 01:47:56,398
... I will have to living
with this sin on my spirit

990
01:47:57,360 --> 01:47:59,399
My God, help me!

991
01:47:59,400 --> 01:48:02,960
It will make you as unhappy as I am Tullio

992
01:48:03,160 --> 01:48:07,719
You lie to yourself . You
have always wished him to die

993
01:48:07,720 --> 01:48:12,639
Not even a moment have I
wished to be free of him...

994
01:48:12,640 --> 01:48:14,679
... because I loved him

995
01:48:14,680 --> 01:48:19,389
My poor creature, a thousand
times I disown those words

996
01:48:20,080 --> 01:48:24,399
And well that you know that , therefore
you will understand that it is all ended

997
01:48:24,400 --> 01:48:28,679
I have loved and I will love
always the father of that creature

998
01:48:28,680 --> 01:48:33,958
Until the end of my days, you
I can only hate, hate...

999
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,399
... and despise you

1000
01:48:37,160 --> 01:48:40,599
Is extraordinary, the
faculty that women have ...

1001
01:48:40,600 --> 01:48:45,354
... to adapt the truth to the romantic
ideals of the worst literature

1002
01:48:45,880 --> 01:48:50,111
The adventure of my wife with
Filippo D'Arborio lasted...

1003
01:48:50,880 --> 01:48:53,479
..the time of a sigh

1004
01:48:53,480 --> 01:48:56,879
So like many of your friends have said...

1005
01:48:56,880 --> 01:49:00,119
...it would have been whimsy
of our fashionable writer...

1006
01:49:00,120 --> 01:49:03,639
... that it has been his fate to catch
a horrendous disease in Africa...

1007
01:49:03,640 --> 01:49:06,299
... that he has paid respect to his creator

1008
01:49:06,300 --> 01:49:10,919
All here. I am sorry to
only have contributed ...

1009
01:49:10,920 --> 01:49:15,279
... to supply elements for
this pessimistic serial

1010
01:49:15,280 --> 01:49:17,319
They will not think that really

1011
01:49:17,320 --> 01:49:20,914
it would have been you to have
caused the death of that innocent?

1012
01:49:21,840 --> 01:49:23,319
I do see it as strange when

1013
01:49:23,320 --> 01:49:25,079
a newly born child has...

1014
01:49:25,080 --> 01:49:29,231
... extraordinary resistance. It
takes more than the cold to kill it

1015
01:49:29,680 --> 01:49:32,591
And therefore, do not make remorse

1016
01:49:32,920 --> 01:49:35,479
If he is dead, it is sure
because it had one...

1017
01:49:35,480 --> 01:49:37,799
No, that does not have importance

1018
01:49:37,800 --> 01:49:42,475
What more concerns me are
the intentions that drive

1019
01:49:43,080 --> 01:49:47,436
and in my intentions there
are no possible doubts

1020
01:49:47,840 --> 01:49:52,039
I have I acted with perfect
clarity of conscience...

1021
01:49:52,040 --> 01:49:55,679
I do not have remorse,
I am not justifying it

1022
01:49:55,680 --> 01:49:58,989
The justice of men does
not touch me because

1023
01:49:59,480 --> 01:50:02,835
... no court on earth will
be able to convict me

1024
01:50:05,320 --> 01:50:08,914
I have bored you?  Sorry

1025
01:50:10,040 --> 01:50:14,999
Is still early.  We still can be together?

1026
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,592
you would give me great pleasure

1027
01:50:51,120 --> 01:50:53,348
Your house pleases me

1028
01:50:55,360 --> 01:50:59,432
You know how many times I
have tried to imagine it...

1029
01:51:01,040 --> 01:51:03,917
... without ever succeeding

1030
01:51:20,480 --> 01:51:24,472
It's strange, because it is similar

1031
01:51:41,760 --> 01:51:43,679
Indeed

1032
01:51:43,680 --> 01:51:46,875
- With all that which is in you
- so beautiful... and so ugly

1033
01:51:48,840 --> 01:51:52,593
What is there ugly.  What we feel

1034
01:51:54,160 --> 01:51:57,196
slowly without haste

1035
01:51:57,600 --> 01:52:00,079
I must watch well...

1036
01:52:02,880 --> 01:52:05,108
... and to reflect

1037
01:52:14,920 --> 01:52:18,593
- you offer me something to drink?  - Sure

1038
01:52:51,600 --> 01:52:55,359
So?  You have decided?

1039
01:52:55,360 --> 01:52:58,237
What is ugly in me?

1040
01:52:59,160 --> 01:53:01,559
You want me to tell you

1041
01:53:03,240 --> 01:53:05,832
let me drink

1042
01:53:13,840 --> 01:53:17,877
I should not. I have drunk
a lot with supper...

1043
01:53:18,480 --> 01:53:21,072
you have put to Me a lot of...

1044
01:53:21,520 --> 01:53:23,873
... melancholy

1045
01:53:31,520 --> 01:53:33,919
Give me another

1046
01:53:35,320 --> 01:53:41,269
A little ago you have asked to me what
I thought about what you have told me

1047
01:53:43,280 --> 01:53:45,395
Now I say to you

1048
01:53:46,800 --> 01:53:50,678
I think you will always
be in love with your wife

1049
01:53:52,680 --> 01:53:56,353
Enamoured to make pity

1050
01:53:57,960 --> 01:54:00,109
That is not my spirit.

1051
01:54:01,920 --> 01:54:05,559
I admit I have had, in these past months...

1052
01:54:05,560 --> 01:54:12,032
... a drunken, clouded
experience, if you want morbid

1053
01:54:12,640 --> 01:54:15,756
Only pure ones are capable of such excesses

1054
01:54:16,560 --> 01:54:20,039
Think of the life of ascetics

1055
01:54:20,040 --> 01:54:22,598
You are still enamoured of her

1056
01:54:23,280 --> 01:54:26,589
Since the first time you were defeated

1057
01:54:27,600 --> 01:54:30,636
you are still fighting...

1058
01:54:31,040 --> 01:54:33,399
... because he has died.

1059
01:54:33,400 --> 01:54:35,753
Poor Tullio

1060
01:54:37,720 --> 01:54:39,994
But that nonsense you say?

1061
01:54:40,240 --> 01:54:44,073
If there is one defeated in
this lugubrious history...

1062
01:54:44,680 --> 01:54:46,795
... It is my wife

1063
01:54:48,400 --> 01:54:53,393
she that decides to live with
the ghosts of the cemetaries...

1064
01:54:53,440 --> 01:54:56,829
... instead of living her life freely

1065
01:54:57,080 --> 01:55:00,230
Refusing to believe

1066
01:55:01,040 --> 01:55:05,559
... that our problems are
resolved on the earth...

1067
01:55:05,560 --> 01:55:08,278
... and not in a hypothetical afterlife

1068
01:55:10,520 --> 01:55:13,476
I instead am what I am

1069
01:55:13,720 --> 01:55:16,950
Without illusions, without repentances

1070
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:23,437
The day in which I will no
longer have pleasure for life...

1071
01:55:23,680 --> 01:55:26,318
... no curiosity...

1072
01:55:27,240 --> 01:55:29,355
... I would make an end of it.

1073
01:55:30,640 --> 01:55:33,232
There are those that say

1074
01:55:34,280 --> 01:55:38,716
instead when the moment comes
in which you stop living...

1075
01:55:39,920 --> 01:55:43,388
... you are only begun to exist

1076
01:55:45,720 --> 01:55:48,679
But if of it we do not explain

1077
01:55:48,680 --> 01:55:52,839
and if unfortunately we do not notice it...

1078
01:55:52,840 --> 01:55:56,229
... we hope for eternal life

1079
01:55:57,240 --> 01:56:00,800
That is not my case,  I swear

1080
01:56:03,120 --> 01:56:08,716
What do you know of it? It will
always be the same for you

1081
01:56:10,520 --> 01:56:12,139
and instead we know nothing of what

1082
01:56:12,140 --> 01:56:14,910
the future reserve us

1083
01:56:15,080 --> 01:56:17,308
Not even a little

1084
01:56:27,920 --> 01:56:30,879
... crazy with desire and jealousy

1085
01:56:30,880 --> 01:56:35,719
I committed many platitudes...

1086
01:56:35,720 --> 01:56:38,551
In order to suffocate my love for you

1087
01:56:39,480 --> 01:56:42,999
Goodness knows because you men...

1088
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:46,159
... with one hand us you want
to always raise us to stars...

1089
01:56:46,160 --> 01:56:49,037
... and with the other drag us down?

1090
01:56:49,240 --> 01:56:53,755
Why do you not let us walk beside you?

1091
01:56:54,120 --> 01:56:59,599
Creature beside creature,
woman beside her man

1092
01:56:59,600 --> 01:57:03,559
None more, none less

1093
01:57:03,560 --> 01:57:05,549
Sure

1094
01:57:06,360 --> 01:57:09,351
I have decided to live with you...

1095
01:57:11,280 --> 01:57:14,032
Live with me?

1096
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:19,389
But I do not love you more treasure

1097
01:57:20,240 --> 01:57:22,912
You are a monster

1098
01:57:24,120 --> 01:57:26,917
Not for what you have told me this evening

1099
01:57:28,160 --> 01:57:33,915
Further, that is not the
natural conclusion of all

1100
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:41,679
You are the most attractive man who
has never held me in his arms...

1101
01:57:41,680 --> 01:57:48,357
... But if one day you persuaded me
of being the arbitrator of my life...

1102
01:57:48,760 --> 01:57:51,910
... I would not want to feel dishonourable

1103
01:58:05,800 --> 01:58:08,438
Now leave me Tullio

1104
01:58:19,400 --> 01:58:22,516
What happens if I lived here?

1105
01:58:23,200 --> 01:58:25,189
You sleep?  Perhaps

1106
01:58:28,040 --> 01:58:30,871
I have drunk too much

1107
01:58:33,320 --> 01:58:35,389
Do not sleep.  I beg You

1108
01:58:37,240 --> 01:58:42,199
Impossible.  I must sleep

1109
01:58:57,200 --> 01:58:59,918
Do not sleep, Teresa

1110
01:59:00,160 --> 01:59:03,549
I want to make you to see
that I know how to finish
