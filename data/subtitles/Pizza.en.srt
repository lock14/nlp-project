2
00:01:21,717 --> 00:01:22,843
The place that we are standing now

3
00:01:22,589 --> 00:01:29,419
Is the same where a big fire accident took place in 1997, killing 17 people, the J.K Polytechnic college

4
00:01:30,033 --> 00:01:32,198
14 years on since the incident took place

5
00:01:32,185 --> 00:01:33,416
The college has always been closed

6
00:01:33,518 --> 00:01:35,026
Nobody ever comes this way

7
00:01:35,072 --> 00:01:40,056
After the fire accident, people around here say that ghosts roam around this college

8
00:01:40,156 --> 00:01:41,202
One Minute

9
00:01:42,648 --> 00:01:44,468
He is Mr.Perumaal

10
00:01:44,781 --> 00:01:47,387
When people here are scared as shit to speak about this college

11
00:01:47,442 --> 00:01:49,850
He remains the only person whose got the guts to talk about it

12
00:01:49,949 --> 00:01:51,237
Yes Mr.Perumall?

13
00:01:51,343 --> 00:01:53,375
Dont you believe in ghosts et all?

14
00:01:53,423 --> 00:01:54,223
I believe

15
00:01:54,355 --> 00:01:55,839
I've seen em myself 4-5 times

16
00:01:56,021 --> 00:01:58,048
But i aint scared and all

17
00:01:58,275 --> 00:02:00,246
I was an attender in this very same college

18
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:00,880
So

19
00:02:00,967 --> 00:02:04,427
It is in this J.K polytechnic college which the whole town seems to scared about that we are going to stay toight

20
00:02:04,538 --> 00:02:13,139
We are going to stay and find out if there is any truth at all to the claims that people in this town have been making

21
00:02:15,496 --> 00:02:16,896
Dude, Careful

22
00:02:18,173 --> 00:02:19,993
This is the classroom

23
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:24,086
Ya, go up

24
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,072
What is this?

25
00:02:34,707 --> 00:02:36,552
This is only the library

26
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,121
Thousands of books, burnt to ashes

27
00:02:40,121 --> 00:02:42,221
These are the only remaining ones

28
00:02:44,262 --> 00:02:47,047
It is here that 4 students died,their bodies as black as charcoal

29
00:02:51,929 --> 00:02:52,856
What's this?

30
00:02:53,134 --> 00:02:54,215
EM spiter

31
00:02:54,248 --> 00:02:54,989
Meaning?

32
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:56,449
In short,

33
00:02:56,495 --> 00:02:58,023
Should a ghost come by

34
00:02:57,928 --> 00:02:59,074
This pointer will start moving

35
00:03:00,952 --> 00:03:01,979
Yeah bro

36
00:03:02,361 --> 00:03:07,289
should we take a video when this pointer moves, the ghost if at all present, will show up on the video

37
00:03:07,289 --> 00:03:09,475
Hence am keeping it with me at all times

38
00:03:10,366 --> 00:03:12,073
bro, is the pointer moving?

39
00:03:12,187 --> 00:03:13,307
No

40
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,040
Ask some of your friends to come?

41
00:03:16,435 --> 00:03:17,555
Dudes come

42
00:03:17,834 --> 00:03:18,842
Small Boys

00:03:21,186 --> 00:03:22,746
Guys, stop fooling around

45
00:03:22,806 --> 00:03:24,508
You might do some crap and leave

46
00:03:24,546 --> 00:03:26,105
It will mean our dead bodies in the future

00:03:26,446 --> 00:03:29,075

00:03:54,023 --> 00:03:55,787
We are aware that someone has come here?

59
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:59,939
It is for you that we've been waiting so long

60
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,589
It is only to see you that we've all come here

This is our job.Shut up and stay quiet

64
00:04:12,618 --> 00:04:13,973
Are we allowed to stay here?

65
00:04:15,346 --> 00:04:23,749
Or do we leave?
If you want us to leave, tell us, show some signal or come and stand infront of us

66
00:04:23,822 --> 00:04:25,082

There was some other sound here

72
00:04:44,307 --> 00:04:46,804
We cant take these sounds and all as your signal

73
00:04:48,105 --> 00:04:49,777
We expect to be told even more clearly

74
00:04:51,551 --> 00:04:53,761
Otherwise we will stay here only

75
00:04:54,455 --> 00:04:56,555

76
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:00,376

00:05:04,726 --> 00:05:05,842
It went from left to right

82
00:05:06,046 --> 00:05:11,220
Then it surely must have been recorded on this camera.
yeah it surely must have.
Prem

83
00:05:17,931 --> 00:05:19,227
It has gone through that door only

84
00:05:19,229 --> 00:05:20,133
Guys,we'll leave

85
00:05:22,972 --> 00:05:25,262
Guys, listen to my words please

86
00:05:34,326 --> 00:05:36,426
Someone is pushing from inside

87
00:05:36,924 --> 00:05:38,754
Look at this

88
00:05:42,317 --> 00:05:44,909
Guys please please listen. Dont do anything

89
00:05:56,949 --> 00:05:57,971

00:05:58,216 --> 00:05:58,762
Give it

91
00:06:01,393 --> 00:06:03,539
Fool, It got over

92
00:06:06,603 --> 00:06:07,578
Now what?

93
00:06:07,797 --> 00:06:09,502
There must've been a very dangerous ghost in that room right?

94
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:11,875
I see that everyday no?

95
00:06:11,988 --> 00:06:13,073
Its so Boring

96
00:06:20,897 --> 00:06:21,744
Sadist

97
00:06:21,857 --> 00:06:23,377
you changed it right at the end of the film

98
00:06:25,231 --> 00:06:26,899
The ghost will come out of the TV and get hold of you or what?

99
00:06:26,955 --> 00:06:28,332
Pussy

100
00:06:30,221 --> 00:06:31,692
Hey, Does this  look like a house to you?

101
00:06:32,253 --> 00:06:34,402
As if you are studying to be a professional ghost hunter

102
00:06:34,473 --> 00:06:37,750
all around ghost books, ghost Dvds,ghost programs

103
00:06:37,722 --> 00:06:40,344
I sometimes find myself seething with doubts if am in love with the devil itself

104
00:06:43,983 --> 00:06:47,203
I've told you countless number of times i aint doin all these for time pass

105
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:49,223
They are research for the novel am writing

106
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:50,562
Keep repeating the same excuse over and over

107
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:53,284
So much for a dumb novel that you are writing..

108
00:06:53,337 --> 00:06:53,971
Hey

109
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:59,255
Someday my novel is going to get published and grab all the awards thats at stake.Just wait and see

110
00:07:02,837 --> 00:07:04,184
Am seriously asking you

111
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,858
Whatever we watch on TV is true eh?

112
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:06,937
You think its not?

113
00:07:06,977 --> 00:07:07,830
You think its the truth?

114
00:07:07,983 --> 00:07:10,010
A ghost will come and walk befor your eyes or what?

115
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:11,823
Its possible

116
00:07:12,684 --> 00:07:14,894
It can.i've seen it myself.

117
00:07:18,564 --> 00:07:19,700
Where?

118
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:20,622
In my first year,

119
00:07:20,735 --> 00:07:21,818
My hostel mate

120
00:07:21,968 --> 00:07:23,522
There was a girl by the name, Deepa

121
00:07:23,783 --> 00:07:26,676
We were gossiping untill 4 in the morning

122
00:07:26,676 --> 00:07:27,776
Before she left for her room

123
00:07:27,944 --> 00:07:30,068
I went to my room and dozed off

124
00:07:30,181 --> 00:07:34,128
When we got up in the morning, shw wasnt alive.

125
00:07:34,915 --> 00:07:36,190
suicide

126
00:07:38,415 --> 00:07:39,888
Have you ever seen someone hanging by the neck?

127
00:07:39,888 --> 00:07:41,008
No

128
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:44,173
The tongue will be hanging out till here

129
00:07:45,503 --> 00:07:47,870
After that i couldnt sleep at night

130
00:07:48,304 --> 00:07:49,560
all of a sudden i'd hear her voices

131
00:07:49,924 --> 00:07:51,457
Like she's close by me

132
00:07:51,689 --> 00:07:53,012
Like she's touching me

133
00:07:53,136 --> 00:07:55,502
i'd feel like someone was always there in my room

134
00:07:55,736 --> 00:07:57,512
one day night i woke up all of a sudden

135
00:07:58,179 --> 00:07:59,135
To see her

136
00:07:59,273 --> 00:08:00,148
on my bed

137
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:01,581
near my legs

138
00:08:01,753 --> 00:08:03,144
Her! It was Her

139
00:08:03,227 --> 00:08:05,253
She was right there and looking at me

140
00:08:05,367 --> 00:08:06,785
She was telling me something

141
00:08:06,967 --> 00:08:08,236
I quickly turned on the lights

142
00:08:08,361 --> 00:08:09,701
to find no one in the room

143
00:08:09,795 --> 00:08:10,442
hey

144
00:08:10,442 --> 00:08:12,387
You aint getting scared are you?

145
00:08:12,475 --> 00:08:13,867
No no. go on

146
00:08:14,274 --> 00:08:16,699
The college itself was talking about that only for a few days

147
00:08:16,961 --> 00:08:19,757
After that, i was not able to stay at that hostel at all

148
00:08:19,813 --> 00:08:21,254
Changing different rooms

149
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:23,032
And here i am in this house, 2 years from then

150
00:08:23,107 --> 00:08:24,885
without any problems

151
00:08:28,855 --> 00:08:30,264
have you seen her after that?

152
00:08:30,335 --> 00:08:31,212
mmm

153
00:08:32,755 --> 00:08:33,853
i've seen her

154
00:08:33,903 --> 00:08:34,458
but

155
00:08:34,498 --> 00:08:35,398
i got used to it

156
00:08:35,804 --> 00:08:38,258
the creepiness disappeared paving the way for interest

157
00:08:38,624 --> 00:08:40,558
i once even tried talking to her

158
00:08:40,869 --> 00:08:41,576
But

159
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:43,042
She didnt talk back

160
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:45,083
why?

161
00:08:45,236 --> 00:08:46,746
Even now she could be in this very room

162
00:08:49,616 --> 00:08:53,116
She could be sitting closeby and listening in to whatever we are talking

163
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:17,834
actually if something like this happens to someone close to us,
thoughts such as these would often come and go

164
00:09:17,872 --> 00:09:18,652
you are using them and exagger

165
00:09:18,652 --> 00:09:19,725
These are not mere thoughts

166
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:20,964
They do exist

167
00:09:21,038 --> 00:09:24,924
Did you know that in chennai alone there are 100-200 people commiting suicide every year?

168
00:09:24,944 --> 00:09:26,477
How many of them are dying in accidents?

169
00:09:26,497 --> 00:09:27,498
What became of them?

170
00:09:27,531 --> 00:09:31,944
Even recently they showed in idhayam program about a building in chennai where ghosts are apparently on the loose

171
00:09:31,944 --> 00:09:32,584
saw that?

172
00:09:35,265 --> 00:09:40,946
Two years back the death of two policemen at the entrance of the same house remains a mystery till date

173
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:43,885
Where is that building by the way?

174
00:09:43,906 --> 00:09:44,322
why?

175
00:09:44,906 --> 00:09:46,773
to feel freaked out everytime you pass by that side eh?

176
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:50,087
Like you've told me very less now

177
00:09:51,267 --> 00:09:52,834
you're so freaked out just hearing about it

178
00:09:52,834 --> 00:09:54,507
what will you do should you witness it?

179
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:57,036
Stuff like these, rather than witnessing it for real

180
00:09:57,036 --> 00:10:00,400
it is even more scary when people like you have to narrate it

181
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:11,670
Honestly, these devils, ghosts exist eh?

182
00:10:11,845 --> 00:10:13,237
For everyone, there will come a moment in life

183
00:10:13,531 --> 00:10:16,143
a moment that makes the unbelievable, believable

184
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:19,491

271
00:15:11,691 --> 00:15:13,006

272
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:15,514

288
00:16:16,347 --> 00:16:17,215

294
00:16:23,547 --> 00:16:25,603
the salary that i get, it aint enough for our expenses itself

295
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,673
now a baby also

296
00:16:28,224 --> 00:16:30,259
already we've bribed the watch-man to manage in this out-house

297
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,692

298
00:16:34,808 --> 00:16:36,206

323
00:18:29,164 --> 00:18:29,670

Laughing forever like a mad-ass

337
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:49,098
Why is this 'Father' sir looking so serious now?

338
00:19:49,197 --> 00:19:51,140
if this had been my place, they'd have beat him black and blue

339
00:19:51,275 --> 00:19:52,948
and they themselves would've bought him new clothes

340
00:19:52,948 --> 00:19:54,496
 and conducted the marriage

341
00:19:55,101 --> 00:19:56,541
he'll drive an aeroplane it seems

342
00:19:56,718 --> 00:19:58,878
 but hesitate to get the license driving an 8

343
00:19:59,793 --> 00:20:00,573
what brother?

344
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:02,574

345
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:03,447
Boss

346
00:20:03,806 --> 00:20:05,294
we've both been in love since our schooldays

347
00:20:06,184 --> 00:20:07,734
any day, it is she who will be my wife

348
00:20:09,024 --> 00:20:09,537
what?

349
00:20:09,857 --> 00:20:12,106
how brother with this salary? marriage? children?

350
00:20:12,567 --> 00:20:13,848
How do i manage brother?

351
00:20:15,447 --> 00:20:18,496
you say that the two of you lived all along together in the same room

352
00:20:19,057 --> 00:20:20,412
Had something like this happened before?

353
00:20:20,824 --> 00:20:22,330
all this is god's gift dude

354
00:20:24,852 --> 00:20:25,487
Hello boss?

355
00:20:25,525 --> 00:20:25,892
what?

356
00:20:27,139 --> 00:20:28,014
dont annoy

357
00:20:28,546 --> 00:20:29,179
whats up with him?

358
00:20:29,295 --> 00:20:31,395
So, that and all is a sin

359
00:20:31,735 --> 00:20:32,753
You should not do abortion

360
00:20:32,753 --> 00:20:33,841
 you should not at all

361
00:20:33,935 --> 00:20:34,869
What do you say to this?

362
00:20:35,162 --> 00:20:35,731
Is that so?

363
00:20:35,802 --> 00:20:36,383
what?

364
00:20:36,408 --> 00:20:38,085
Shall we put a case on the company?

365
00:20:54,478 --> 00:20:55,509
michael

366
00:20:56,127 --> 00:20:59,373
You are saying that, no matter what, it is that girl that you are going to marry

367
00:20:59,552 --> 00:21:04,115
Most of the people today who come asking for divorce,come only in costly cars

368
00:21:04,727 --> 00:21:07,220
So rather than fretting yourself over money,

369
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:09,677
 shut and go get yourself married

370
00:21:09,929 --> 00:21:10,904
What am saying is correct only no?

371
00:21:10,904 --> 00:21:12,153
yeah
marry her

00:30:13,938 --> 00:30:15,166
if you expect something radical,

446
00:30:15,166 --> 00:30:16,843
am quite ready to stoop to those levels

447
00:30:16,998 --> 00:30:18,738
Dont delay any longer and send it as soon as possible

448
00:30:25,069 --> 00:30:25,824

456
00:30:34,853 --> 00:30:35,860
This christmas

457
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:36,888

the best plan

462
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,180
rather than inviting everyone, spending

463
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:48,881
Fighting over the taste of the dishes offered

464
00:30:49,049 --> 00:30:49,793

Do you want to see somebody?

00:33:11,118 --> 00:33:12,889
are you angry over someone?

518
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,889
or do you seek revenge over something?

519
00:33:35,313 --> 00:33:36,900

520
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,048

522
00:33:40,527 --> 00:33:41,201

528
00:33:53,721 --> 00:33:55,821
Dont tell this to anyone outside

529
00:33:56,283 --> 00:33:57,152
girl-child

530
00:33:58,637 --> 00:33:59,577

531
00:33:59,883 --> 00:34:00,773
ok sir

532
00:34:01,452 --> 00:34:02,529
the guy was asking her

533
00:34:03,162 --> 00:34:04,457
if she wanted to see someone

534
00:34:05,096 --> 00:34:06,429
if she was angry over someone

535
00:34:06,534 --> 00:34:08,230
if she seeked revenge

536
00:34:09,883 --> 00:34:11,291
She turns her head then

537
00:34:11,291 --> 00:34:12,281
And looks at me

538
00:34:12,281 --> 00:34:13,015
In a very weird way

539
00:34:13,682 --> 00:34:14,520
an angry look

540
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:16,222
that very instant, i started shivering

541
00:34:17,175 --> 00:34:18,466
didnt i say the other day itself?

542
00:34:19,408 --> 00:34:20,546
your moment came, see?

543
00:34:35,369 --> 00:34:38,039
you can guess the presence of ghosts with certain signals

544
00:34:38,039 --> 00:34:38,902
How?

545
00:34:38,937 --> 00:34:42,338
Somewher in the distance, a dog will...

546
00:34:55,229 --> 00:34:55,229
buffalo, buffalo

547
00:34:56,922 --> 00:34:58,532
i'd have died you fool

548
00:35:11,628 --> 00:35:13,143
i've known priya from when she was young

549
00:35:13,242 --> 00:35:14,418
A very good girl

550
00:35:14,418 --> 00:35:16,198
only in the last 2 years that its become like this

551
00:35:16,259 --> 00:35:17,980
She'd been to some friend's place

552
00:35:17,999 --> 00:35:19,062
and had returned by night

553
00:35:19,065 --> 00:35:20,639
and started screaming all of a sudden

554
00:35:20,779 --> 00:35:23,629
ever since, she's been suffering like this

555
00:35:23,658 --> 00:35:27,285
ever since there's not a temple or priest or sorcerer that shanmugam has spared

556
00:35:40,674 --> 00:35:42,055
one night around 1.30

557
00:35:42,281 --> 00:35:43,606
i was smoking on the terrace

558
00:35:44,455 --> 00:35:45,654
there was a railway track behind

559
00:35:46,229 --> 00:35:47,484
in the distance i saw a woman standing

560
00:35:48,309 --> 00:35:50,610
how fast do you think a woman can walk on a railway track?

561
00:35:50,919 --> 00:35:52,407
There will be stones all right?

562
00:35:52,732 --> 00:35:53,713
i kept watching

563
00:35:53,713 --> 00:35:55,209
She went like a flash from that end to this end

564
00:36:27,718 --> 00:36:28,281
Brother

565
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:28,786

01:33:20,670 --> 01:33:22,663
a guy who was suspicious over his wife,

1136
01:33:22,663 --> 01:33:24,063
killed her

1137
01:33:24,749 --> 01:33:26,157
shot their child also

1138
01:33:26,497 --> 01:33:27,748
and commited suicide

1139
01:33:27,857 --> 01:33:29,770
that has been locked since

1140
01:33:29,959 --> 01:33:31,854
those people near the house

1141
01:33:31,891 --> 01:33:34,347
they believe that there are ghosts in there

1142
01:33:34,512 --> 01:33:35,758
even two years back

1143
01:33:35,758 --> 01:33:38,329
2 policemen were found dead there

1144
01:33:38,432 --> 01:33:40,437
till date no one knows how they died

1145
01:33:41,019 --> 01:33:44,200
the case is still open in the police department

1146
01:33:44,512 --> 01:33:45,968
these are the details of the house

1147
01:33:48,929 --> 01:33:51,029
this, small girl,who died

1148
01:33:51,688 --> 01:33:52,809
her name's nithya eh?

1149
01:33:54,786 --> 01:33:56,886
the lady's name was smitha

1150
01:33:57,966 --> 01:33:59,366
kid's name?

1151
01:34:00,453 --> 01:34:01,730
i'll ask them to enquire

1152
01:34:10,449 --> 01:34:11,867
the other day doctor prescribed right?

1153
01:34:11,867 --> 01:34:12,721
inhaler

1154
01:34:12,721 --> 01:34:15,291
use it when you have difficulty breathing

1155
01:34:15,516 --> 01:34:16,389
you know how to use it right?

1156
01:34:16,389 --> 01:34:16,860
i know

1157
01:34:20,365 --> 01:34:21,841
ok i'll have bath and come

1158
01:34:23,165 --> 01:34:25,451
the watchman of this house was a total drunkard sir

1159
01:34:25,652 --> 01:34:28,194
he only rented out the outhouse to them

1160
01:34:28,326 --> 01:34:31,126
Micheal brother only used to come and go often

1161
01:34:32,146 --> 01:34:33,546
the girl..

1162
01:34:33,793 --> 01:34:34,715
i've hardly seen her

1163
01:34:34,734 --> 01:34:37,534
both of them grew up in an orphanage in madurai

1164
01:34:38,028 --> 01:34:39,199
when i asked him,

1165
01:34:39,199 --> 01:34:43,524
he said they left the ashram 5 years back

1166
01:34:41,408 --> 01:34:44,908
it seems nobody in the ashram knew about the marriage either

1167
01:34:43,749 --> 01:34:44,944
i enquired in the college

1168
01:34:45,626 --> 01:34:48,312
it seems she came 2 months back to get her arrears application

1169
01:34:48,533 --> 01:34:51,168
after that there's been no contact from her side

1170
01:34:51,675 --> 01:34:53,207
nothing's clear here

1171
01:34:53,335 --> 01:34:55,031
if we dont any clues

1172
01:34:55,031 --> 01:34:56,794
the way we enquire itself will be radically different

1173
01:34:57,255 --> 01:34:59,144
what if he himself had killed and buried her?

1174
01:35:00,301 --> 01:35:01,395
he's not that kind of a person sir

1175
01:35:02,132 --> 01:35:05,659
huh? there are people who even kill infants!

1176
01:35:09,054 --> 01:35:10,065
anu wouldnt have gone anywhere

1177
01:35:10,065 --> 01:35:11,434
we'll sure find her

1178
01:35:13,207 --> 01:35:14,941
you first get out of that room, outside

1179
01:35:15,230 --> 01:35:17,457
stupid thoughts'll come to you should you keep to yourself

1180
01:35:17,615 --> 01:35:18,170
First

1181
01:35:18,276 --> 01:35:19,045
you've to come for work

1182
01:35:19,283 --> 01:35:20,749
then only you will have some sort of diversion

1183
01:35:25,654 --> 01:35:27,474
brother? brother..

1184
01:35:28,299 --> 01:35:29,185
what?

1185
01:35:29,365 --> 01:35:30,050
inside

1186
01:35:30,865 --> 01:35:32,193
something black

1187
01:35:32,200 --> 01:35:33,320
some figure

1188
01:35:33,864 --> 01:35:34,792
what are you talking about?

1189
01:35:34,792 --> 01:35:35,514
inside

1190
01:35:45,955 --> 01:35:47,109
no one's in here

1191
01:35:49,628 --> 01:35:50,137
go

1192
01:35:52,548 --> 01:35:53,668
go

1193
01:35:56,074 --> 01:35:56,994
the other day

1194
01:35:56,994 --> 01:35:58,193
i went for this kottiyokam delivery remember?

1195
01:35:58,193 --> 01:35:59,321
around 10.30

1196
01:36:00,392 --> 01:36:00,962
then

1197
01:36:01,135 --> 01:36:03,235
there was some sudden breeze

1198
01:36:03,985 --> 01:36:05,283
like something went inside me

1199
01:36:06,223 --> 01:36:07,430
some sort of bad smell

1200
01:36:07,950 --> 01:36:08,442
i...

1201
01:36:08,442 --> 01:36:09,491
just freaked out

1202
01:36:09,716 --> 01:36:10,643
can you please

1203
01:36:10,643 --> 01:36:12,343
send pandi out on late nights?

1204
01:36:35,208 --> 01:36:36,479
you're okay right?

1205
01:36:42,326 --> 01:36:43,061
brother?

1206
01:36:43,060 --> 01:36:45,160
see if there's any bleeding here?

1207
01:36:46,806 --> 01:36:47,981
there's nothing there

1208
01:36:48,634 --> 01:36:50,034
this side?

1209
01:36:55,083 --> 01:36:56,570
seriously there's nothing

1210
01:36:57,158 --> 01:36:58,274
nothing ah?

1211
01:37:01,796 --> 01:37:03,165
all of a sudden he freaks out

1212
01:37:03,288 --> 01:37:04,776
He cries thinking about the girl

1213
01:37:04,935 --> 01:37:07,152
he's asking to check if there's blood in his back and all

1214
01:37:08,379 --> 01:37:11,018
its so hard for me to see him suffering in the room uncle

1215
01:37:15,622 --> 01:37:16,286
that..

1216
01:37:16,286 --> 01:37:17,665
any news on the girl?

1217
01:37:18,728 --> 01:37:19,687
but

1218
01:37:20,191 --> 01:37:22,291
when we were packing at his place,

1219
01:37:22,386 --> 01:37:24,638
there was no trace of a girl having lived there

1220
01:37:24,751 --> 01:37:25,430
what?

1221
01:37:27,022 --> 01:37:28,142
yeah

1222
01:37:29,402 --> 01:37:30,430
how much longer?

1223
01:37:30,430 --> 01:37:32,048
do you want us to clear the body or not?

1224
01:37:32,048 --> 01:37:32,768
Dont come nearby

1225
01:37:32,768 --> 01:37:33,858
Move, move, move

1226
01:37:39,296 --> 01:37:40,416
what?

1227
01:37:41,212 --> 01:37:41,752
know her?

1228
01:37:41,752 --> 01:37:42,522
no sir

1229
01:37:42,522 --> 01:37:43,642
ok ok clear the place

1230
01:37:44,428 --> 01:37:46,039
all of you leave the place, leave leave

1231
01:37:49,246 --> 01:37:50,150
dont cry

1232
01:37:50,716 --> 01:37:51,836
its not her right?

1233
01:37:57,995 --> 01:38:02,195
you've intentionally or unintentionally done something bad to the kid, nithya

1234
01:38:02,716 --> 01:38:04,146
her spirit only

1235
01:38:04,145 --> 01:38:08,235
is seeking a blood-thirsty revenge over you

1236
01:38:09,411 --> 01:38:10,628
whatever happened till date

1237
01:38:10,628 --> 01:38:11,785
whatever's happening now

1238
01:38:11,785 --> 01:38:13,885
its all her actions,her game

1239
01:38:14,090 --> 01:38:17,094
she is trying to make you, come to her place,with her game

1240
01:38:17,544 --> 01:38:18,849
with god's grace

1241
01:38:19,096 --> 01:38:20,506
we should put this ghost down in the right way

1242
01:38:21,190 --> 01:38:23,990
or bad events such as these wont stop occuring

1243
01:38:24,951 --> 01:38:25,679
Not just that

1244
01:38:25,847 --> 01:38:27,527
even murder might take place

1245
01:38:27,726 --> 01:38:28,901
if you agreed to it

1246
01:38:29,126 --> 01:38:31,121
there's a malayalee sorceror i know

1247
01:38:31,368 --> 01:38:33,210
he's a specialist in controlling ghosts

1248
01:38:33,708 --> 01:38:34,848
we'll invite him and

1249
01:38:34,848 --> 01:38:36,564
do a pooja this full moon

1250
01:38:37,841 --> 01:38:39,534
the order came from thist area only

1251
01:38:39,727 --> 01:38:41,294
but he never went to the house from which the order came

1252
01:38:41,561 --> 01:38:43,666
like he said, his bike was outside this house only

1253
01:38:43,937 --> 01:38:44,797
so, like he says,

1254
01:38:44,797 --> 01:38:45,964
the bag must be in here only

1255
01:38:46,271 --> 01:38:47,675
shall we go inside and just take it?

1256
01:38:54,763 --> 01:38:55,570
it feels creepy only

1257
01:38:55,569 --> 01:38:56,017
but what do we do now?

1258
01:38:56,918 --> 01:38:58,607
it already has killed 2

1259
01:38:59,492 --> 01:39:00,589
dont be hasty

1260
01:39:02,198 --> 01:39:03,427
if its there,it'll be inside only right?

1261
01:39:04,746 --> 01:39:06,846
the sorcerer's coming from kerala

1262
01:39:07,353 --> 01:39:08,640
we'll do a pooja at full moon

1263
01:39:09,573 --> 01:39:10,543
and go inside with their help

1264
01:39:20,567 --> 01:39:22,158
he's not troubled by ghosts all

1265
01:39:22,598 --> 01:39:23,881
but it aint looking like he's lying either

1266
01:39:24,651 --> 01:39:25,771
but

1267
01:39:26,391 --> 01:39:27,563
he's seen something

1268
01:39:27,798 --> 01:39:29,289
and has become terribly scared

1269
01:39:29,592 --> 01:39:31,824
he keeps talking about a girl, anu

1270
01:39:32,692 --> 01:39:34,182
if that girl is not found,

1271
01:39:34,676 --> 01:39:36,661
it is very hard to get him back to normalcy

1272
01:39:38,302 --> 01:39:39,530
the girl,anu

1273
01:39:39,800 --> 01:39:40,863
does she really exist?

1274
01:39:43,312 --> 01:39:44,629
have any of you seen her?

1275
01:39:45,506 --> 01:39:46,284
why sir?

1276
01:39:47,666 --> 01:39:49,366
it is possible that the girl's an imagination

1277
01:39:51,123 --> 01:39:52,484
could be a ghost also

1278
01:40:06,713 --> 01:40:07,538
brother?

1279
01:40:27,250 --> 01:40:28,124
sit down

1280
01:40:30,657 --> 01:40:31,714
how are you?

1281
01:40:32,163 --> 01:40:33,031

1283
01:40:35,491 --> 01:40:36,217

1284
01:40:37,438 --> 01:40:40,005

1285
01:40:40,265 --> 01:40:41,040

1286
01:40:41,378 --> 01:40:43,205
but i dont go anywhere after 8 sir

1287
01:40:44,438 --> 01:40:46,253
the other day when i was walking down the road

1288
01:40:46,339 --> 01:40:48,141
there was a sort of breeze

1289
01:40:48,673 --> 01:40:50,773
like something got into me

1290
01:40:51,246 --> 01:40:52,807
some weird smell

1291
01:40:52,917 --> 01:40:53,596
here

1292
01:40:58,404 --> 01:40:59,804

pray to the amman and sleep

01:41:06,024 --> 01:41:07,288

1298
01:41:14,304 --> 01:41:15,473

nothing would've happened to anu

1300
01:41:19,155 --> 01:41:20,573

1301
01:41:20,795 --> 01:41:23,595
Troubling you so much at such a young age

1302
01:41:25,693 --> 01:41:27,093
dont cry

1303
01:41:27,820 --> 01:41:28,904
nothing will happen

1304
01:41:29,227 --> 01:41:30,407
god will save us

1305
01:41:30,707 --> 01:41:32,044

1345
01:44:44,870 --> 01:44:46,066

1346
01:44:46,718 --> 01:44:47,150

1347
01:44:47,150 --> 01:44:47,749

1351
01:44:49,970 --> 01:44:51,190
go see if anything happened to the pizza

1352
01:44:51,270 --> 01:44:52,654

1353
01:44:59,427 --> 01:45:00,361

1354
01:45:01,579 --> 01:45:02,587

1355
01:45:03,066 --> 01:45:04,602
if i dont deliver it within 15 mins

1356
01:45:04,769 --> 01:45:06,227
it will show on my salary

1357
01:45:34,890 --> 01:45:36,390
it is worth a minimum of 2 crores

1358
01:45:39,305 --> 01:45:40,423
shall we take it and run away?

1359
01:45:42,565 --> 01:45:43,538
quit joking

1360
01:45:43,792 --> 01:45:44,538

1361
01:45:45,132 --> 01:45:47,003

1362
01:45:47,343 --> 01:45:48,694
a life selling pizzas

1363
01:45:48,950 --> 01:45:50,331

1364
01:45:50,331 --> 01:45:51,612
search a job

1365
01:45:52,370 --> 01:45:53,317
think a little

1366
01:45:53,451 --> 01:45:55,954
we'll be able to settle in UK/US in 1 month

1367
01:45:56,345 --> 01:45:57,830
you're serious eh?

1368
01:45:59,504 --> 01:46:03,004
if you dont deliver the pizzzas within 30 mins, you dont collect money na?

1369
01:46:03,200 --> 01:46:03,761
why?

1370
01:46:04,064 --> 01:46:06,188
anything that you dont get on time is a waste only

1371
01:46:06,297 --> 01:46:08,913
whats the point in being a rich man at 50?

1372
01:46:08,964 --> 01:46:14,077
we've spent almost half our lives wearing donated clothes and donated food, from the ashram

1373
01:46:14,101 --> 01:46:15,633
it is now that we are going to enjoy life

1374
01:46:16,302 --> 01:46:19,171
even if not for our sake, let it be for the sake of our child

1375
01:46:21,422 --> 01:46:22,888
But sir is a very good man

1376
01:46:23,082 --> 01:46:24,101
we too are michael

1377
01:46:39,074 --> 01:46:40,014
but how?

1378
01:46:40,701 --> 01:46:41,607
with this money

1379
01:46:41,607 --> 01:46:42,343
within 10 days

1380
01:46:42,342 --> 01:46:45,267
we will be able to get fake passports, visas and degree certificates

1381
01:46:46,107 --> 01:46:48,166
we will be at some other place untill we board the flight

1382
01:46:49,113 --> 01:46:50,210
where shall we go?

1383
01:46:52,483 --> 01:46:53,981
we'll go to banglore

1384
01:46:54,203 --> 01:46:55,843
there will be a bus now

1385
01:46:56,257 --> 01:46:57,768
first we'll leave this place

1386
01:46:58,279 --> 01:47:00,697
within few minutes they will start searching for the missing you

1387
01:47:26,529 --> 01:47:28,324
but we need not leave together

1388
01:47:28,324 --> 01:47:29,790
doubts will be cast

1389
01:47:30,539 --> 01:47:32,058
untill now, none of them have seen you

1390
01:47:32,380 --> 01:47:34,517
so you pack your things and leave first

1391
01:47:34,820 --> 01:47:36,048
me........

1392
01:47:36,633 --> 01:47:38,076
i cant leave the bike like this and come

1393
01:47:38,612 --> 01:47:39,782
after doing something to cover that

1394
01:47:40,168 --> 01:47:41,288
i will board a bus tonight

1395
01:47:41,325 --> 01:47:43,519
we'll meet tomorrow morning in banglore

1396
01:47:44,540 --> 01:47:45,972
what if you get caught before boarding the bus?

1397
01:47:46,738 --> 01:47:47,858
if i get caught?

1398
01:47:52,136 --> 01:47:54,310
they'll ask me where i wnet for so long

1399
01:47:56,936 --> 01:47:58,614
they'll ask where's that box right?

1400
01:48:01,218 --> 01:48:02,819
but i dont know that these are inside the box right?

1401
01:48:03,106 --> 01:48:05,075
they'll ask you what happened to the bike and bag

1402
01:48:05,159 --> 01:48:05,823
what do we tell?

1403
01:48:07,950 --> 01:48:08,728
what shall we tell?

1404
01:48:13,038 --> 01:48:13,776
Accident?

1405
01:48:14,878 --> 01:48:17,188
an accident everything but the vehicle is in proper shape eh?

1406
01:48:17,709 --> 01:48:19,369
what if you say someone stole it?

1407
01:48:21,989 --> 01:48:23,198
a police complaint will be made

1408
01:48:23,596 --> 01:48:24,412
we'll get caught

1409
01:48:26,953 --> 01:48:29,269
we should be able to sell a story that they'll believe

1410
01:48:36,364 --> 01:48:37,272
a ghost story?

1411
01:48:42,310 --> 01:48:44,185
everyone have their own weaknesses

1412
01:48:44,764 --> 01:48:45,760
for some, money

1413
01:48:46,064 --> 01:48:47,245
for some, god

1414
01:48:47,588 --> 01:48:48,816
for some, girls

1415
01:48:49,262 --> 01:48:50,219
for your boss?

1416
01:48:53,722 --> 01:48:54,295
spirits

1417
01:48:54,512 --> 01:48:55,202
ghosts

1418
01:48:55,272 --> 01:48:56,080
devils

1419
01:49:06,312 --> 01:49:07,880
you've read my novel right?

1420
01:49:08,072 --> 01:49:09,406
in that , your boss

1421
01:49:09,406 --> 01:49:10,520
his daughter

1422
01:49:10,700 --> 01:49:12,100
some bungalow

1423
01:49:12,792 --> 01:49:14,788
incorporate all these and tell him a believable story

1424
01:49:14,891 --> 01:49:17,674
the other day they were talking in a TV program about some haunted house right?

1425
01:49:17,811 --> 01:49:18,818
smitha bungalow

1426
01:49:18,845 --> 01:49:20,290
what name did priya say that day?

1427
01:49:24,498 --> 01:49:27,560
two constables were also found dead in the bungalow

1428
01:49:27,845 --> 01:49:28,828
enough ah?

1429
01:49:28,828 --> 01:49:30,790
we can use all this and make a ghost film itself

1430
01:49:31,593 --> 01:49:32,477
that is all fine

1431
01:49:32,476 --> 01:49:33,905
what if they ask me where my wife is?

1432
01:49:34,647 --> 01:49:36,579
tell something and manage

1433
01:49:36,613 --> 01:49:37,853
first, we'll leave this place

1434
01:49:40,080 --> 01:49:41,009
stay safe

1435
01:49:41,314 --> 01:49:42,434
when there's no one around,

1436
01:49:42,575 --> 01:49:44,008
leave the bike infront of the house

1437
01:49:44,101 --> 01:49:44,754
board a bus

1438
01:49:44,868 --> 01:49:46,032
call me on my vodafone number

1439
01:49:47,178 --> 01:49:48,305
they've already started doubting

1440
01:49:48,305 --> 01:49:49,447
you first leave the place

1441
01:49:52,207 --> 01:49:54,484
hey, everything will be fine right?

1442
01:49:54,772 --> 01:49:56,592
it must, it should

1443
01:49:56,998 --> 01:49:57,590

1444
01:50:03,074 --> 01:50:03,972

1445
01:50:13,441 --> 01:50:14,571
hey, have you boarded the bus?

1446
01:50:15,274 --> 01:50:17,149

1447
01:50:17,294 --> 01:50:19,277

1463
01:51:05,723 --> 01:51:07,543
he's struggling to speak

1464
01:51:08,109 --> 01:51:10,032

if she's also not there

1476
01:51:58,558 --> 01:51:59,857
