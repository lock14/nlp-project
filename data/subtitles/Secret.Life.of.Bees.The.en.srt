1
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:07,199
<i>Deborah?</i>

2
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,325
- Where you been?
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry, T.

3
00:01:09,435 --> 00:01:11,335
- Are you cheating on me?
- No, no! I'm not cheating on you.

4
00:01:11,437 --> 00:01:13,928
- What...
- Stop it! What are you doing?

5
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,031
- T! Stop it!
- You ain't leaving me!

6
00:01:16,142 --> 00:01:19,077
- Who is it?
- Nobody! It's you! I hate you!

7
00:01:19,178 --> 00:01:22,204
T. Ray, just let me go!

8
00:01:22,315 --> 00:01:25,341
No!

9
00:01:25,451 --> 00:01:28,007
<i>T. Ray, damn it!
Get off me!</i>

10
00:01:28,187 --> 00:01:29,714
Lily!

11
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:41,064
<i>I killed my mother when I was four years old.</i>

12
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:43,863
<i>That's what I knew about myself.</i>

13
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:46,837
<i>She was all I wanted,</i>
<i>and I took her away.</i>

14
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:50,041
<i>Nothin' else much mattered.</i>

15
00:02:38,457 --> 00:02:39,924
- T. Ray!
- What?

16
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:42,187
There's bees in my room!
Hundreds of' em! You've gotta see!

17
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:44,786
- What is it? Jesus Christ, Lily.
- They're in my room! Come see.

18
00:02:44,897 --> 00:02:46,865
What?

19
00:02:57,944 --> 00:02:59,844
Goddamn it, Lily.
This ain't funny.

20
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:02,346
But they were here.
They were flyin' everywhere.

21
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:04,814
You wake me again,
I'm gonna get out the grits.

22
00:03:04,917 --> 00:03:06,885
You hear me?

23
00:03:09,755 --> 00:03:11,723
<i>Goddamn it.</i>

24
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:26,763
<i>The bees came the summer of'64...</i>

25
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:31,742
<i>The summer I turned 14 and my whole life</i>
<i>went spinnin' off into a whole new orbit.</i>

26
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:35,644
<i>Lookin' back on it,</i>
<i>I wanna say they were sent to me.</i>

27
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:40,208
<i>I wanna say they showed up like</i>
<i>the Angel Gabriel appearing to the Virgin Mary.</i>

28
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,583
<i>I know it's forward to compare</i>
<i>my small life to hers...</i>

29
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:47,983
<i>but I have good reason</i>
<i>to believe she wouldn't mind.</i>

30
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:19,582
So, um, my birthday is tomorrow.

31
00:04:21,996 --> 00:04:24,590
Most girls want...

32
00:04:24,698 --> 00:04:29,726
one of them little silver charm bracelets
they have down at the mercantile.

33
00:04:29,837 --> 00:04:33,432
Think I'm the only girl in junior high
doesn't have one.

34
00:04:37,111 --> 00:04:40,638
But I was just thinking you could tell me
about my mother instead.

35
00:04:40,748 --> 00:04:44,650
<i>All you ever said is she's from Virginia</i>
<i>and she's an only child like I am.</i>

36
00:04:44,752 --> 00:04:46,982
<i>I don't even know what</i>
<i>her favorite food was...</i>

37
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:50,716
<i>and what she liked</i>
<i>to do and...nothin;</i>

38
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:02,193
- You wanna know about your mama?
- Yeah.

39
00:05:03,304 --> 00:05:06,273
Mm-hmm.

40
00:05:06,373 --> 00:05:09,399
She used to spend hours
lurin' roaches and whatnot...

41
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:12,206
out of the house with graham crackers
and marshmallows.

42
00:05:13,247 --> 00:05:15,909
Swear to God.

43
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:24,013
She was a lunatic about savin' bugs.

44
00:05:39,106 --> 00:05:40,300
Here you go.

45
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:54,669
<i>Hey, Lily! Nice ass!</i>

46
00:05:54,781 --> 00:05:56,749
Oh!

47
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:07,593
Gotcha.

48
00:06:10,563 --> 00:06:14,294
Rosaleen.
Look at this thing fight.

49
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,426
- What you doin' with that?
- Catching bees to show T. Ray.

50
00:06:17,537 --> 00:06:19,437
He thinks I'm making it up.

51
00:06:19,539 --> 00:06:22,201
Get yourself stung,
don't come cryin' to me.

52
00:06:22,308 --> 00:06:25,471
- Come fix this.
- For the future...

53
00:06:25,578 --> 00:06:27,159
What'd they do?
Drop the atom bomb or somethin'?

54
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,741
Hush.

55
00:06:28,848 --> 00:06:33,046
It does say that there are those
who are equal before God...

56
00:06:33,152 --> 00:06:36,451
shall now also be equal
in the polling booths...

57
00:06:36,556 --> 00:06:38,888
in the classrooms,
in the factories...

58
00:06:38,992 --> 00:06:40,641
and in hotels and restaurants
and movie theaters...

59
00:06:40,642 --> 00:06:42,291
Holy shit.

60
00:06:42,395 --> 00:06:44,329
And other places that provide
service to the public.

61
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,955
Today, July the 2nd, 1964...

62
00:06:47,066 --> 00:06:49,694
President Johnson signed
the Civil Rights bill into law.

63
00:07:09,322 --> 00:07:12,257
Fifteen, 16, 17, 18...

64
00:07:12,358 --> 00:07:15,486
19, 20, 21, 22.

65
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:33,868
<i>When's my hair gonna</i>
<i>look like yours?</i>

66
00:08:35,642 --> 00:08:39,669
I bet mine used to drive you crazy the way
it goes off in 11 wrong directions.

67
00:08:41,414 --> 00:08:45,248
I bet you used to brush it a hundred times a day
just to get it to lay down.

68
00:08:47,387 --> 00:08:49,855
I bet you did.

69
00:08:50,923 --> 00:08:54,882
<i> Lily!</i>

70
00:08:54,994 --> 00:08:56,962
<i>Lily!</i>

71
00:08:58,631 --> 00:09:00,599
<i>Lily!</i>

72
00:09:05,705 --> 00:09:07,935
- Who you out here with?
- What?

73
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:11,602
- Who's out there?
- Nobody. There's no one here but me. It's just me.

74
00:09:11,711 --> 00:09:13,645
Get up from there.

75
00:09:18,985 --> 00:09:21,351
Get in here.

76
00:09:21,454 --> 00:09:25,618
No! You think you're grown? Huh?

77
00:09:26,826 --> 00:09:29,818
Out there doing God knows what.

78
00:09:29,929 --> 00:09:33,160
You'll get yourself pregnant
and then what? Huh?

79
00:09:33,266 --> 00:09:35,291
Huh?

80
00:10:39,332 --> 00:10:41,300
You can go.

81
00:10:51,944 --> 00:10:54,879
Mornin'.

82
00:10:54,981 --> 00:10:57,609
How long your dad
keep you on these grits?

83
00:10:57,717 --> 00:10:59,685
Hour.

84
00:11:03,756 --> 00:11:05,747
Look at ya.

85
00:11:08,227 --> 00:11:10,354
Happy birthday.

86
00:11:11,664 --> 00:11:13,564
I didn't know you made me a cake.

87
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:15,600
Of course I did.
It's your birthday.

88
00:11:15,701 --> 00:11:17,931
- How big a piece you want?
- Real big.

89
00:11:23,276 --> 00:11:25,676
You should be in the stand already.

90
00:11:25,778 --> 00:11:28,008
It's a big peach day.

91
00:11:32,185 --> 00:11:35,154
- Takin' her to town with me.
- What for?

92
00:11:35,254 --> 00:11:39,418
She needs a training bra.
She gots to get measured.

93
00:11:43,529 --> 00:11:45,520
How much something like that cost?

94
00:12:01,551 --> 00:12:03,815
Happy birthday.

95
00:12:10,927 --> 00:12:12,895
So what's in town anyway?

96
00:12:14,431 --> 00:12:17,025
I'm registerin' to vote.

97
00:12:17,134 --> 00:12:21,764
Rosaleen, news said a colored man in Mississippi
was killed for doing that.

98
00:12:22,906 --> 00:12:25,067
Good thing we ain't
in Mississippi then.

99
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:33,474
I saw you scribblin' one of your stories
in the stand yesterday.

100
00:12:34,751 --> 00:12:36,776
Go on. Tell it.

101
00:12:36,887 --> 00:12:39,151
All right.

102
00:12:39,256 --> 00:12:41,315
So The Supremes,
they're heading down Highway 4...

103
00:12:41,424 --> 00:12:43,915
because they're going to Charleston
for a real big concert.

104
00:12:44,027 --> 00:12:45,927
But suddenly, their back tire blows up...

105
00:12:46,029 --> 00:12:48,259
and they go skiddin' across the road
and into a ditch.

106
00:12:48,365 --> 00:12:51,425
So then two are saying
that Diana's burnin' the peach cobbler.

107
00:12:51,535 --> 00:12:55,562
But she blocks the oven and she says, "I'm the
lead singer, and it's done when I say it's done."

108
00:12:55,672 --> 00:12:58,505
So I don't know what to do.
The Supremes are having a fight in my kitchen.

109
00:12:58,608 --> 00:13:01,509
- But then suddenly we hear...
- Hey.

110
00:13:01,611 --> 00:13:04,205
Ain't you Terence Ray's little girl?

111
00:13:04,314 --> 00:13:06,714
Yes, sir. Lily.

112
00:13:06,817 --> 00:13:09,718
<i>Daddy know you out here with her?</i>

113
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:12,880
Rosaleen works for us.

114
00:13:12,989 --> 00:13:16,322
Whole lot of niggers been
coming through here today.

115
00:13:16,426 --> 00:13:18,986
You wouldn't be going to
that secret meetin', would ya?

116
00:13:19,095 --> 00:13:22,587
Well, hell, we ain't gotta
worry about this one.

117
00:13:22,699 --> 00:13:25,896
Can't register to vote
if you can't write your own name.

118
00:13:26,002 --> 00:13:30,371
Tell me, Lily. She a smart nigger
or a dumb nigger?

119
00:13:30,473 --> 00:13:32,168
- Please, mister, we really need...
- Answer me, girl.

120
00:13:39,115 --> 00:13:47,352
R-O-S-A-L-E-E-N.

121
00:13:49,092 --> 00:13:51,890
No!

122
00:13:53,163 --> 00:13:55,654
- Rosaleen! Stop!
- Put her there!

123
00:13:57,701 --> 00:14:00,329
Apologize!

124
00:14:00,437 --> 00:14:02,337
<i>Stop! No!</i>

125
00:14:02,439 --> 00:14:05,067
- Apologize!
- <i> Rosaleen, just apologize!</i>

126
00:14:06,309 --> 00:14:08,209
<i>Help! Somebody help!</i>

127
00:14:08,311 --> 00:14:10,211
Quiet.

128
00:14:10,313 --> 00:14:11,871
- Can somebody help?
- Apologize.

129
00:14:11,982 --> 00:14:13,745
Daddy!

130
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,754
Your black ass gonna apologize
one way or the other.

131
00:14:24,661 --> 00:14:27,027
Rosaleen. Rosaleen.

132
00:14:32,202 --> 00:14:34,363
- Thank you, Sheriff.
- You have to help her.

133
00:14:34,471 --> 00:14:36,200
- <i> Get in the goddamn truck.</i>
- <i>I ain't restin;...</i>

134
00:14:36,306 --> 00:14:38,274
- till your nigger apologizes.
- I'm sorry, Frank!

135
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:42,402
- I promised her!
- Get in the goddamn truck.

136
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,449
She dumped snuff juice
on a white man...

137
00:14:46,549 --> 00:14:49,143
on Frank Posey, for Christ's sake.

138
00:14:49,252 --> 00:14:52,585
I wouldn't be surprised
if he flat-out kills her.

139
00:14:52,689 --> 00:14:57,456
You don't mean that.
He wouldn't really kill her.

140
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:00,893
Sheriff s gonna take her to the hospital.
She'll be fine.

141
00:15:00,997 --> 00:15:03,488
Goddamn it. What the hell
were you thinkin'?

142
00:15:18,014 --> 00:15:20,312
Don't you leave this room, you hear?
I gotta settle payroll with...

143
00:15:20,417 --> 00:15:22,681
You don't scare me.

144
00:15:22,786 --> 00:15:25,254
- What'd you say?
- You're a coward.

145
00:15:27,254 --> 00:15:30,815
My mother would never let you touch me!

146
00:15:30,925 --> 00:15:33,519
That goddamn woman
give a shit about you.

147
00:15:33,628 --> 00:15:35,755
She loved me.

148
00:15:35,863 --> 00:15:38,161
I hate you!

149
00:15:47,608 --> 00:15:50,600
<i>Now you listen here.</i>

150
00:15:50,711 --> 00:15:55,546
Truth is, your sorry mama,
she ran off and left you.

151
00:15:57,385 --> 00:16:02,322
<i>On the day she died, she come back</i>
<i>for the rest of her things...not you.</i>

152
00:16:02,423 --> 00:16:04,288
That ain't true.

153
00:16:06,927 --> 00:16:09,327
It's not.

154
00:16:41,228 --> 00:16:43,628
<i>Dr. Cash, please call the page.</i>

155
00:16:43,731 --> 00:16:46,757
<i>Dr. Cash, please call</i>
<i>the page operator.</i>

156
00:16:57,178 --> 00:16:59,612
Rosaleen.

157
00:16:59,714 --> 00:17:01,511
They beat you again?

158
00:17:01,615 --> 00:17:04,948
We gotta get you out of here.

159
00:17:05,052 --> 00:17:08,419
- I can't get out of here. I'm in jail.
- You shouldn't be.

160
00:17:08,522 --> 00:17:10,990
That's gotta go.

161
00:17:17,264 --> 00:17:19,926
Rosaleen.

162
00:17:26,841 --> 00:17:30,208
- This is crazy.
- Oh, it'll be all right.

163
00:17:30,311 --> 00:17:32,108
It'll be all right.

164
00:17:38,052 --> 00:17:40,543
Shh.

165
00:17:55,836 --> 00:17:59,636
- A white girl come by here?
- Uh, no, sir. Nobody. I ain't moved from this spot.

166
00:18:22,096 --> 00:18:25,998
<i>When I was born</i>

167
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:29,558
<i>My daddy said I was broken</i>

168
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:32,639
<i>Beginning of the end</i>

169
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:37,939
- You gals be careful now.
- <i>The life I hadn't chosen</i>

170
00:19:02,636 --> 00:19:04,797
Let me get this straight.

171
00:19:04,905 --> 00:19:07,135
You got us goin' to Tiburon...

172
00:19:07,241 --> 00:19:10,404
'cause your mama got a picture
with that town written on the back?

173
00:19:10,511 --> 00:19:12,536
That's it?

174
00:19:12,646 --> 00:19:14,910
T. Ray said my mother left me
way before she died.

175
00:19:19,687 --> 00:19:22,383
Well, it's not true.

176
00:19:22,489 --> 00:19:24,957
He only made it up to punish me.
I know he did.

177
00:19:25,059 --> 00:19:27,084
Knowing your daddy,
he could do a thing like that.

178
00:19:27,194 --> 00:19:29,856
And my mother could never do
what he said she did.

179
00:19:33,334 --> 00:19:35,234
Huh.

180
00:19:36,337 --> 00:19:38,396
I get it.

181
00:19:38,505 --> 00:19:40,530
You ran off 'cause of
what he said, didn't you?

182
00:19:41,976 --> 00:19:45,207
It ain't had nothin' to do
with me being in jail.

183
00:19:45,312 --> 00:19:50,375
And here you got me worrying myself sick
about you getting in trouble 'cause of me.

184
00:19:50,484 --> 00:19:54,750
So what you fixin' to do? Go door-to-door
askin' folks about your mama?

185
00:19:54,855 --> 00:19:57,346
- That's your bright idea?
- I don't exactly have a plan, all right?

186
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:59,824
Well, you sure had one
back at the hospital.

187
00:19:59,927 --> 00:20:02,691
Comin' in there and sayin',
"We gonna do this, and we gonna do that."

188
00:20:02,796 --> 00:20:06,163
And I'm supposed to follow you
like some dumb nigger like they said.

189
00:20:06,267 --> 00:20:08,701
Well, you are dumb pouring your spit
on that man's shoe like that...

190
00:20:08,802 --> 00:20:11,600
and dumber not to say you're sorry
if sayin' it will save your life.

191
00:20:11,705 --> 00:20:13,798
That man was gonna come back
and kill you or worse.

192
00:20:13,908 --> 00:20:17,571
And I go and I get you out of there,
and this is how you thank me?

193
00:20:18,512 --> 00:20:21,003
Well, fine.

194
00:21:01,155 --> 00:21:03,055
Are you all right?

195
00:21:04,391 --> 00:21:06,484
I feel like I've been beaten
with a stick.

196
00:21:06,593 --> 00:21:08,857
You have been beaten, remember?

197
00:21:08,963 --> 00:21:11,761
But not with a stick.

198
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:23,169
I know you can't understand.

199
00:21:23,277 --> 00:21:27,680
Apologizing to those men
would've just been a different way of dyin'...

200
00:21:27,781 --> 00:21:30,011
'cept I have to live with it.

201
00:21:33,954 --> 00:21:37,856
If I can find someplace open,
I'll buy us some food.

202
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:40,119
What we gonna do for beds?

203
00:21:40,227 --> 00:21:42,559
Find a motel, I guess.

204
00:21:42,663 --> 00:21:45,757
Lily, there ain't gonna be a place
that'll take a colored woman.

205
00:21:45,866 --> 00:21:47,857
Well, what about
the Civil Rights Act?

206
00:21:50,004 --> 00:21:52,495
Ain't nothin' but a piece of paper.

207
00:22:02,616 --> 00:22:05,949
Excuse me, sir.
Are you serving food today?

208
00:22:06,053 --> 00:22:09,887
Oh, yes, ma'am. We have
a Sunday plate special: Barbecued pork.

209
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:12,481
Um, we'll take two of those,
please, and two Cokes.

210
00:22:15,295 --> 00:22:16,887
I don't believe
I've seen you before.

211
00:22:16,997 --> 00:22:19,932
I'm not from here.
I'm... I'm just visiting my grandmother.

212
00:22:20,034 --> 00:22:22,366
<i>Your daddy's gonna be so proud of you.</i>

213
00:22:22,469 --> 00:22:24,266
- Afternoon, Carol.
- Hi.

214
00:22:24,371 --> 00:22:25,838
- Why, don't you two look smart.
- When we get home...

215
00:22:25,939 --> 00:22:29,272
You come on in, and I'll wrap
those up for you to go.

216
00:22:43,357 --> 00:22:45,985
Miss, you change your mind?

217
00:22:46,093 --> 00:22:49,426
- Where did you get those?
- Oh, I know what you mean.

218
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:52,055
<i>Virgin Mary's pictured</i>
<i>as a colored woman.</i>

219
00:22:52,166 --> 00:22:55,135
<i>But, see, the woman that makes</i>
<i>the honey is colored herself.</i>

220
00:22:55,235 --> 00:22:57,533
Best honey in South Carolina.

221
00:22:57,638 --> 00:22:59,299
What is her name?

222
00:22:59,406 --> 00:23:02,204
August Boatwright.

223
00:23:02,309 --> 00:23:04,402
Do you know where she lives?

224
00:23:04,511 --> 00:23:09,107
Darnedest house you ever saw. Painted like
Pepto-Bismol. Your grandma's probably seen it.

225
00:23:15,122 --> 00:23:16,953
<i>What do you think's goin' on?</i>

226
00:23:17,057 --> 00:23:20,493
Look like they dressed for church.

227
00:23:20,594 --> 00:23:23,154
- Bye-bye!
- <i> You think one of them's August?</i>

228
00:23:23,263 --> 00:23:25,288
Whoever she is, I hope she make honey...

229
00:23:25,399 --> 00:23:27,560
better than she picks out paint.

230
00:23:28,602 --> 00:23:30,832
I like it.

231
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:53,325
Now, don't go gettin'
your hopes up, all right?

232
00:23:53,427 --> 00:23:55,691
They got nowhere else to go.

233
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,043
Yes?

234
00:24:15,149 --> 00:24:18,380
- Are you August Boatwright?
- <i>No.</i>

235
00:24:18,485 --> 00:24:22,444
I'm June Boatwright.
August is my sister.

236
00:24:23,657 --> 00:24:27,525
- You came to see her?
- Hi. I'm May Boatwright.

237
00:24:27,628 --> 00:24:31,086
I'm August's sister too.

238
00:24:31,198 --> 00:24:33,462
Is she expecting you?

239
00:24:33,567 --> 00:24:35,865
Um, I just saw some honey at the store,
and the man said that...

240
00:24:35,969 --> 00:24:37,960
You come for honey?

241
00:24:38,071 --> 00:24:42,371
Why didn't you say so?
Come into the parlor. I'll go get her.

242
00:24:42,476 --> 00:24:45,968
Then after that she gonna go get
September and October.

243
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,520
<i>Who we got here?</i>

244
00:25:32,059 --> 00:25:34,687
I'm Lily and this is Rosaleen.

245
00:25:36,863 --> 00:25:39,423
We need a place to stay.

246
00:25:43,136 --> 00:25:46,469
You see, my mother died of tularemia when
I was little, and my daddy just got killed...

247
00:25:46,573 --> 00:25:49,633
in a tractor accident on our farm in
Spartanburg County, so me and Rosaleen...

248
00:25:49,743 --> 00:25:52,769
she's our housekeeper... we're on our way
to Virginia to stay with my Aunt Bernie.

249
00:25:52,879 --> 00:25:55,211
'Cept I don't have money
for a train ticket or a motel...

250
00:25:55,315 --> 00:25:57,340
and not that anyone
would take in a Negro woman...

251
00:25:57,451 --> 00:25:59,681
even though it's a violation
of the Civil Rights Act.

252
00:26:07,494 --> 00:26:11,555
- Looks like you've been beaten.
- She fell down some steps when we were leavin'.

253
00:26:11,665 --> 00:26:14,327
Must've been a lot of steps.

254
00:26:34,288 --> 00:26:37,655
May, honey, go on out to the wall
and finish your crying.

255
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:45,425
Is she all right?

256
00:26:45,532 --> 00:26:47,864
I'm sorry.
We can't help you.

257
00:26:49,269 --> 00:26:52,500
We can't have 'em living
on the side of the road.

258
00:26:52,606 --> 00:26:56,042
Why don't you call your aunt,
see about her sending you some train fare?

259
00:26:56,143 --> 00:27:01,979
I would, but she just had a real big operation
and she's still stayin' in the hospital.

260
00:27:02,082 --> 00:27:06,451
<i>So maybe Rosaleen and I could just work</i>
<i>for the money, and then just be on our way.</i>

261
00:27:10,057 --> 00:27:12,525
Well...

262
00:27:12,626 --> 00:27:15,891
I guess Rosaleen can help
May in the kitchen...

263
00:27:15,996 --> 00:27:18,021
and you can help me and Zach
with the bees.

264
00:27:18,131 --> 00:27:20,463
August.

265
00:27:20,567 --> 00:27:22,899
We have the cots in the honey house.

266
00:27:26,239 --> 00:27:29,970
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

267
00:27:32,946 --> 00:27:34,937
<i>I hope y'all like the smell of honey.</i>

268
00:27:35,048 --> 00:27:36,948
<i>It can be a bit overwhelming at first...</i>

269
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:39,018
<i>but you'll get used to it.</i>

270
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:43,749
Zach and I sleep out here come in December
when we harvestin' honey round the clock.

271
00:27:45,158 --> 00:27:48,855
It can get hot out here,
so you wanna keep that on.

272
00:27:48,962 --> 00:27:50,862
You'll have to use
the bathroom in the house.

273
00:27:50,964 --> 00:27:54,695
We never lock the door, so just come on in
whenever you need to.

274
00:27:54,801 --> 00:27:58,202
- There you go.
- This ain't charity. I'll pay you back for it.

275
00:27:58,305 --> 00:28:00,739
Oh, yeah, you can work it off.

276
00:28:00,841 --> 00:28:03,810
I imagine y'all two wanna rest up.

277
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:09,678
If you get hungry, there's some sweet potato
biscuits on the stove. They're May's specialty.

278
00:28:09,783 --> 00:28:11,410
Thank you again, Miss August.

279
00:28:19,326 --> 00:28:23,353
I'm sure sorry to hear about T. Ray.
Aunt Bernie too.

280
00:28:23,463 --> 00:28:25,522
I know it wasn't right to lie,
but I didn't have a choice.

281
00:28:25,632 --> 00:28:28,226
How come you ain't say nothin'
about your mama or show that picture?

282
00:28:28,335 --> 00:28:30,235
Ain't that why we're here
in the first place?

283
00:28:30,337 --> 00:28:33,135
If they knew I ran away,
they'd have to call T. Ray to come get me.

284
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:36,835
Then they'd find out you a fugitive
and they'd have to call the police.

285
00:28:36,943 --> 00:28:41,573
I feel like I'm where I'm supposed to be.
I really do.

286
00:28:41,681 --> 00:28:46,482
I just need some time to figure out why,
so don't say anything.

287
00:28:46,586 --> 00:28:49,646
Your secret.
You do what you want with it.

288
00:28:52,092 --> 00:28:54,322
They're so cultured.

289
00:28:56,229 --> 00:28:58,254
I never met Negro women
like them before.

290
00:28:58,365 --> 00:29:02,392
- Just us dumb ignorant ones.
- That's not what I'm sayin'.

291
00:29:06,206 --> 00:29:08,731
Guess I never met Negro women
like them neither.

292
00:29:08,842 --> 00:29:12,403
- How much land did she say they got?
- Twenty-eight acres.

293
00:29:12,512 --> 00:29:16,881
It's like it's got its own spot in the world,
where the outside don't come in.

294
00:29:16,983 --> 00:29:18,814
<i>Well, that's a good thing.</i>

295
00:29:18,919 --> 00:29:21,285
We'll be safe here, right?

296
00:29:37,571 --> 00:29:39,471
<i>This is bullshit.</i>

297
00:29:39,573 --> 00:29:41,564
You know she in
some kind of trouble.

298
00:29:41,675 --> 00:29:44,337
Well, who's gonna
take 'em in if we don't?

299
00:29:44,444 --> 00:29:47,140
No one around here.

300
00:29:47,247 --> 00:29:49,477
So what if that trouble follow 'em?

301
00:29:53,286 --> 00:29:55,652
I need to do this, all right?

302
00:30:22,349 --> 00:30:27,446
<i>I went down to the water</i>

303
00:30:28,388 --> 00:30:30,879
<i>All night long</i>

304
00:30:33,827 --> 00:30:38,890
<i>I put my feet in</i>

305
00:30:39,699 --> 00:30:42,327
<i>All night long</i>

306
00:30:42,435 --> 00:30:46,269
<i>And I went down</i>

307
00:30:46,373 --> 00:30:51,003
<i>To the water</i>

308
00:30:51,111 --> 00:30:54,512
<i>All night long</i>

309
00:30:54,614 --> 00:31:01,315
<i>And I put my dreams in</i>

310
00:31:02,622 --> 00:31:07,059
<i>All night long</i>

311
00:31:08,461 --> 00:31:11,919
<i>And what you did to me</i>

312
00:31:14,034 --> 00:31:18,061
<i>I can't take no more</i>

313
00:31:20,407 --> 00:31:22,841
<i>I'll take these bad things</i>

314
00:31:22,943 --> 00:31:25,275
<i>And I'll</i>

315
00:31:25,378 --> 00:31:33,285
<i>Lay them at the shore</i>

316
00:31:57,210 --> 00:31:59,735
<i>You gonna break my car?</i>

317
00:31:59,846 --> 00:32:01,746
<i>No, I'm not gonna break your car.</i>

318
00:32:01,848 --> 00:32:03,213
<i>I'm just askin: 'cause you're</i>
<i>lookin' a little confused.</i>

319
00:32:04,684 --> 00:32:08,017
<i>It is hotter than a pot of rice, and you got nerve</i>
<i>to give me a hard time? Give me that wrench.</i>

320
00:32:08,121 --> 00:32:11,454
- No, you get it.
- Not gonna play, June Bug?

321
00:32:11,558 --> 00:32:13,583
You gonna play?

322
00:32:15,095 --> 00:32:17,120
- Come here.
- No. What?

323
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:19,323
- Come here now.
- What are you doing?

324
00:32:19,432 --> 00:32:20,899
- You know what we doing.
- I don't dance.

325
00:32:21,001 --> 00:32:23,663
- Oh, you're dancin' now.
- No, I don't. I don't dance.

326
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:27,103
- No, no. Get off.
- Come here.

327
00:32:28,608 --> 00:32:31,839
- <i>Come on, June.</i>
- Don't you pick me up.

328
00:32:31,945 --> 00:32:33,776
Stop it.

329
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,348
Place a beehive on my grave

330
00:32:36,449 --> 00:32:40,010
<i>And let the honey</i>
<i>soak through</i>

331
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,782
When I'm dead and gone

332
00:32:42,889 --> 00:32:45,824
- That's what I want from you
- Oh, thank you.

333
00:32:45,925 --> 00:32:48,792
The streets of heaven
are gold and sunny

334
00:32:48,895 --> 00:32:51,693
- <i>But I'll stick with my plot</i>
- <i> Mornin;</i>

335
00:32:51,798 --> 00:32:54,028
- Mornin'.
- You sleep all right?

336
00:32:54,134 --> 00:32:56,694
- Yes, ma'am.
- <i>Come on. Grab yourself a chair.</i>

337
00:32:56,803 --> 00:32:59,897
- Okay.
- Hey.

338
00:33:00,006 --> 00:33:03,339
- This one's yours.
- Thank you.

339
00:33:09,182 --> 00:33:12,515
- So, who's that man out there?
- <i> Oh, that's Neil.</i>

340
00:33:12,619 --> 00:33:15,019
He teaches at the school
where June teaches music.

341
00:33:15,121 --> 00:33:18,648
- He's sweet on her.
- It seems like she's sweet on him too.

342
00:33:18,758 --> 00:33:20,919
Yeah, but she won't say so.

343
00:33:21,027 --> 00:33:24,463
He tried every which way to get her
to marry him, but she won't.

344
00:33:24,564 --> 00:33:27,533
- How come?
- Too scared.

345
00:33:27,634 --> 00:33:30,535
<i>May, June might think that's a little personal.</i>

346
00:33:30,637 --> 00:33:33,697
<i>Hell, I'll tell any folk that'll listen</i>
<i>I threw my man out.</i>

347
00:33:33,807 --> 00:33:35,655
Put his brain in a bird
and the bird'll fly backwards.

348
00:33:42,549 --> 00:33:44,915
<i>Mmm.</i>

349
00:33:45,018 --> 00:33:48,181
How come y'all got names
from a calendar?

350
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:50,017
Our mama loved spring and summer.

351
00:33:52,959 --> 00:33:56,895
We had an April too, but...

352
00:33:58,231 --> 00:34:00,699
she died when she was little.

353
00:34:10,844 --> 00:34:13,540
- You ain't gonna fix that car.
- I'm gonna fix it.

354
00:34:17,751 --> 00:34:20,219
- What set May off?

355
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,948
She upset 'cause
you won't marry Neil.

356
00:34:24,858 --> 00:34:27,486
See that? You should go on and marry me
and quit upsettin' your sister.

357
00:34:27,594 --> 00:34:29,789
Get out of here.

358
00:34:29,896 --> 00:34:32,626
No, woman, you promised me pancakes,
and I ain't leavin' till I get 'em.

359
00:34:32,732 --> 00:34:36,259
You must be Rosaleen. Neil.

360
00:34:36,369 --> 00:34:37,836
- And you must be Lily.
- Yes, sir.

361
00:34:37,937 --> 00:34:40,963
What's burnin'?

362
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,508
Don't worry.
We'll just make you another one.

363
00:34:49,616 --> 00:34:52,141
Or how about some grits?

364
00:34:52,252 --> 00:34:54,846
No. Thank you.
That's... That's all right.

365
00:34:54,954 --> 00:34:56,751
I'm just not really hungry.

366
00:34:56,856 --> 00:34:59,188
Then let's get to work.

367
00:34:59,292 --> 00:35:01,089
Check on May.

368
00:35:01,194 --> 00:35:04,527
I'm going to the N.A.A.C.P. Offices.
We're canvassing voters this morning.

369
00:35:04,631 --> 00:35:06,299
<i>Uh, wait.</i>
<i>What about my pancakes?</i>

370
00:35:06,299 --> 00:35:07,698
<i>Uh, wait.</i>
<i>What about my pancakes?</i>

371
00:35:07,801 --> 00:35:09,462
The batter's right there
by the griddle.

372
00:35:12,772 --> 00:35:15,036
Now how could beauty be so evil?

373
00:35:16,843 --> 00:35:21,507
I've been stung so many times,
I have immunity.

374
00:35:21,614 --> 00:35:23,809
They barely even hurt me.

375
00:35:23,917 --> 00:35:27,683
But since you don't, you need
to know beeyard etiquette.

376
00:35:27,787 --> 00:35:31,018
- Beeyard etiquette?
- You see...

377
00:35:31,124 --> 00:35:33,115
the world's really
just one big beeyard.

378
00:35:33,226 --> 00:35:35,990
The same rules work in both places.

379
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:41,992
Don't be afraid, as no life-lovin' bee
wants to sting you.

380
00:35:42,101 --> 00:35:47,129
But don't be an idiot.
That's why we wear long sleeves and long pants.

381
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:51,836
And don't swat.
Don't even think about swattin'.

382
00:35:51,945 --> 00:35:54,709
And above all, send the bees love.

383
00:35:54,814 --> 00:35:58,648
Every little thing wants to be loved.

384
00:36:01,087 --> 00:36:03,078
Let's go.

385
00:36:26,779 --> 00:36:30,306
Now, we'll constantly
be checking the hives.

386
00:36:30,416 --> 00:36:35,251
We have to make sure the queens have enough
room to lay their eggs, otherwise we get swarms.

387
00:36:36,956 --> 00:36:38,685
What do you mean, a swarm?

388
00:36:38,791 --> 00:36:43,023
When you get a queen and a group
of independent-minded bees...

389
00:36:43,129 --> 00:36:49,090
that split off and look for another place to live,
then you get swarms.

390
00:36:49,202 --> 00:36:51,170
And I lose my bees.

391
00:36:51,271 --> 00:36:54,536
So, what we have to do is...

392
00:36:56,009 --> 00:36:57,601
take out the frames
filled with honey...

393
00:36:59,245 --> 00:37:01,042
and put in empty ones.

394
00:37:09,255 --> 00:37:13,214
Now, the smoke, it calms the bees...

395
00:37:13,326 --> 00:37:17,126
and it masks the alarm scent
released by the guard bees.

396
00:37:37,083 --> 00:37:39,745
Why, you ain't scared a lick, huh?

397
00:37:39,852 --> 00:37:43,811
I love you. I love you. I love you.
I love you. I love you.

398
00:37:43,923 --> 00:37:45,914
All right.

399
00:37:55,401 --> 00:37:57,301
Easy movement.

400
00:38:03,376 --> 00:38:04,934
See right there, Lily?

401
00:38:05,044 --> 00:38:09,140
That's the queen... the large one.

402
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,784
<i>That wall behind the house...</i>

403
00:38:16,889 --> 00:38:19,483
Why does it have little pieces
of paper in it?

404
00:38:19,592 --> 00:38:22,254
Oh, well, that's May's wall.

405
00:38:22,362 --> 00:38:24,830
She made it herself.

406
00:38:24,931 --> 00:38:27,491
I guess you noticed
she a little different, huh?

407
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,500
She sure gets upset easy.

408
00:38:32,205 --> 00:38:34,400
She had a twin sister, April.

409
00:38:34,507 --> 00:38:36,941
- The one who died.
- Mm-hmm.

410
00:38:37,043 --> 00:38:41,139
It's like the two of them were
one soul sharing two bodies.

411
00:38:41,247 --> 00:38:44,580
If April got a toothache,
May's gum would plump up red.

412
00:38:44,684 --> 00:38:47,676
One time my father used
a belt strap on April.

413
00:38:47,787 --> 00:38:51,188
I swear, welts rose up
on May's legs too.

414
00:38:53,693 --> 00:38:57,720
When April died, it was like the whole world
became May's twin sister.

415
00:38:57,830 --> 00:39:00,094
And we tried for years
to get her help...

416
00:39:00,199 --> 00:39:03,760
but the doctors just kept
telling us to put her away.

417
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:07,397
So June and I come up with
this idea of the "wailing wall."

418
00:39:07,507 --> 00:39:12,001
- What kind of wall?
- The "wailing wall," like the one in Jerusalem.

419
00:39:12,111 --> 00:39:17,014
The Jewish people go there to mourn. See,
they write their prayers on tiny pieces of paper...

420
00:39:17,116 --> 00:39:19,050
and then they tuck 'em in the wall.

421
00:39:19,152 --> 00:39:22,417
And that's what Miss May does.

422
00:39:22,522 --> 00:39:28,119
Those bits of paper are
all the heavy feelings May carries around.

423
00:39:28,227 --> 00:39:30,821
Seems like the only thing
that helps her.

424
00:39:34,867 --> 00:39:37,461
Poor Miss May.

425
00:39:39,539 --> 00:39:42,303
Yeah. Poor Miss May.

426
00:39:53,286 --> 00:39:55,379
That's Zach's car.
He must be in the honey house.

427
00:39:55,488 --> 00:39:57,718
Why don't you go in and say hello.

428
00:40:02,862 --> 00:40:05,695
All right, this one's dedicated
to all my honeys.

429
00:40:05,798 --> 00:40:08,494
Oh... Don't worry.
You my honey too.

430
00:40:08,601 --> 00:40:13,129
<i>Baby, I need your lovin'</i>

431
00:40:13,239 --> 00:40:16,504
Got to have all of your lovin'

432
00:40:16,609 --> 00:40:20,978
Baby, I need your lovin'

433
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,241
Got to have all of your lovin'

434
00:40:30,423 --> 00:40:33,119
I w... I was just singin'.

435
00:40:33,226 --> 00:40:35,524
I'm Lily.

436
00:40:35,628 --> 00:40:37,755
I'm staying with Miss August
and them for a while.

437
00:40:37,864 --> 00:40:41,766
Oh. Well, um, I'm-I'm Zachary Taylor,
her godson.

438
00:40:41,868 --> 00:40:43,665
Zachary Taylor was a president.

439
00:40:43,769 --> 00:40:47,637
Yeah, so I heard.

440
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:50,436
Come here. Look.

441
00:40:50,543 --> 00:40:54,035
See? "Zachary Lincoln Taylor."

442
00:40:58,853 --> 00:41:03,916
Uh, Miss August told me about
you bein' here helpin' out.

443
00:41:04,025 --> 00:41:05,993
She didn't mention anything
about you being white.

444
00:41:07,462 --> 00:41:09,362
Maybe she didn't notice.

445
00:41:26,915 --> 00:41:28,815
Ooh.

446
00:41:35,457 --> 00:41:37,357
- Mmm, mmm.
- Just put it in.

447
00:41:37,459 --> 00:41:40,292
Miss August, you know
I got stung today, right?

448
00:41:40,395 --> 00:41:42,295
Did you? Where?

449
00:41:42,397 --> 00:41:44,831
Right there.
Probably can't see it much.

450
00:41:52,273 --> 00:41:54,298
No, I'm telling you that
they don't intend on voting.

451
00:41:54,409 --> 00:41:56,400
<i>But you gotta see it from the other side.</i>

452
00:41:56,511 --> 00:41:59,810
<i>The time is right</i>

453
00:41:59,914 --> 00:42:03,941
<i>I'm gonna pack my bags</i>

454
00:42:04,052 --> 00:42:09,888
<i>And take that journey</i>
<i>down the road</i>

455
00:42:11,092 --> 00:42:14,027
<i>'Cause over the mountain</i>

456
00:42:14,129 --> 00:42:17,098
- <i>I see the bright sunshine</i>
- Go. Let it go.

457
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:23,003
<i>But I want to live inside the glow</i>

458
00:42:26,541 --> 00:42:29,009
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

459
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:32,341
<i>I wanna go</i>
<i>to the place where</i>

460
00:42:32,447 --> 00:42:36,281
<i>I am nothing and everything</i>

461
00:42:36,384 --> 00:42:39,217
<i>That exists between</i>

462
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:42,687
<i>Here and nowhere</i>

463
00:42:44,626 --> 00:42:47,959
<i>I wanna go the place where</i>

464
00:42:48,063 --> 00:42:50,429
<i>Time has no consequences</i>
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

465
00:42:50,532 --> 00:42:52,432
- Hear the poppin'?
- Yeah.

466
00:42:52,534 --> 00:42:54,502
- <i>The sky opens to</i>
- It's from capping. Now you try.

467
00:42:54,602 --> 00:42:57,196
- Whoa. Whoa.
- I'm sorry.

468
00:42:57,305 --> 00:42:59,865
<i>I wanna go to beautiful</i>

469
00:42:59,974 --> 00:43:02,374
<i>Beautiful</i>

470
00:43:02,477 --> 00:43:06,140
- Put the uncapped frames in the spinner.
- <i>Beautiful, I wanna go to</i>

471
00:43:06,247 --> 00:43:09,683
- Pushes out all the honey.
- <i>Beautiful, beautiful</i>

472
00:43:09,784 --> 00:43:11,752
<i>Beautiful</i>

473
00:43:11,853 --> 00:43:15,084
<i>I wanna go to</i>
<i>beautiful, beautiful</i>

474
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:18,284
Miss August says you can run like Wilma Rudolph.

475
00:43:18,393 --> 00:43:21,624
Yeah, in a championship game
I was running everywhere like...

476
00:43:21,729 --> 00:43:25,221
- Uh, hey, hey.
- Oh, no!

477
00:43:25,333 --> 00:43:28,268
<i>Beautiful</i>
<i>I wanna go to</i>

478
00:43:28,369 --> 00:43:31,566
<i>Beautiful, beautiful</i>

479
00:43:31,673 --> 00:43:34,767
<i>Beautiful</i>
<i>I wanna go to</i>

480
00:43:34,876 --> 00:43:37,106
<i>Beautiful</i>

481
00:43:38,346 --> 00:43:40,246
Hmm.

482
00:43:40,348 --> 00:43:43,010
- You want me to light your candle?
- Yes, ma'am.

483
00:43:49,724 --> 00:43:51,783
You all enjoy.

484
00:43:51,893 --> 00:43:54,020
Thank you, Miss May.

485
00:43:54,129 --> 00:43:57,860
She calls it a candlestick salad.

486
00:43:57,966 --> 00:44:00,799
She's been making 'em for me
since I was little.

487
00:44:00,902 --> 00:44:04,394
- It looks like...
- Yeah. Yeah, I know. I know.

488
00:44:04,506 --> 00:44:07,100
<i>May?</i>

489
00:44:07,208 --> 00:44:11,167
So, what's your favorite
subject in school?

490
00:44:11,279 --> 00:44:14,771
English. I was plannin' on
being a writer.

491
00:44:16,451 --> 00:44:20,854
I don't really think I got much of
a future now, being an orphan and all.

492
00:44:20,955 --> 00:44:26,086
Don't writers, like,
just imagine things you don't see?

493
00:44:27,996 --> 00:44:31,159
You should imagine yourself
having a future.

494
00:44:31,266 --> 00:44:33,791
That's what I do.

495
00:44:33,902 --> 00:44:37,360
Playing professional football?

496
00:44:37,472 --> 00:44:41,033
Why do white people always think sports
is the only way we could be successful?

497
00:44:41,142 --> 00:44:42,609
I wanna be a lawyer.

498
00:44:46,085 --> 00:44:49,418
I'm sorry. I just thought
'cause you were good at it.

499
00:44:49,522 --> 00:44:51,490
I've never heard of a Negro lawyer.

500
00:44:51,590 --> 00:44:54,024
You never heard of
Thurgood Marshall?

501
00:44:54,126 --> 00:44:56,788
- No.
- Forget it.

502
00:45:03,769 --> 00:45:07,865
All right. I'm picturing you
as a lawyer.

503
00:45:07,973 --> 00:45:12,103
Take the case of a girl who's wrongly accused
of hurtin' somebody.

504
00:45:12,211 --> 00:45:16,671
At the very last minute, you get the truth by
trickin' the real bad guy on the witness stand.

505
00:45:17,817 --> 00:45:20,980
You bust his ass with the truth.

506
00:45:23,956 --> 00:45:26,481
Yeah.

507
00:45:26,592 --> 00:45:29,857
Zach, the ass-bustin' lawyer.

508
00:45:33,666 --> 00:45:35,930
Oh. Thank you, May.

509
00:45:36,035 --> 00:45:38,003
- Here.
- No gravy.

510
00:45:38,103 --> 00:45:40,970
- Smells good.
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

511
00:45:46,645 --> 00:45:49,170
So how are things coming
with you, Lily?

512
00:45:49,281 --> 00:45:53,308
Things are coming fine,
Miss June. Thank you.

513
00:45:53,419 --> 00:45:57,219
- I made banana daisy...
- You've been here almost a week now.

514
00:45:57,323 --> 00:46:00,656
Your aunt must be worried.

515
00:46:00,759 --> 00:46:04,024
If you want us to leave,
me and Rosaleen will be on our way.

516
00:46:04,129 --> 00:46:08,566
Oh, heavens to Betsy, Lily. Nobody wants you
to leave till you're good and ready.

517
00:46:13,942 --> 00:46:15,967
Why do you put a Negro Mary
on your honey?

518
00:46:16,077 --> 00:46:18,807
<i>You mean why is she black...</i>

519
00:46:20,115 --> 00:46:22,083
or why is she on the honey?

520
00:46:23,485 --> 00:46:26,579
- I guess both.
- <i> Tell her, August.</i>

521
00:46:30,992 --> 00:46:33,927
- I'm Sugar Girl.
- I'm Cressie.

522
00:46:35,763 --> 00:46:40,132
- I'm Doll.
- And I'm her daughter, Violet.

523
00:46:40,235 --> 00:46:43,170
And I'm Greta, Zachary's mama.

524
00:46:43,271 --> 00:46:45,364
Mmm, I love Sundays.

525
00:46:45,473 --> 00:46:47,441
What the hell kind
of church is this?

526
00:46:47,542 --> 00:46:50,557
It's been a while since
we told the story of our Mary.

527
00:46:50,558 --> 00:46:53,572
Mm-hmm.

528
00:46:53,681 --> 00:46:58,277
And since we have visitors here who've
never heard it, I thought we'd tell it again.

529
00:46:58,386 --> 00:47:01,287
- That's right. Tell the story.
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

530
00:47:01,389 --> 00:47:03,380
<i>Back in the days of slavery...</i>

531
00:47:03,491 --> 00:47:07,018
our people would go
to the praise house on Sunday...

532
00:47:07,128 --> 00:47:09,619
and ask the Lord
to send them rescue.

533
00:47:09,731 --> 00:47:14,134
<i>One day a slave named Obadiah</i>
<i>was loading bricks onto a boat...</i>

534
00:47:14,235 --> 00:47:18,638
<i>and he saw somethin' that had</i>
<i>washed up on the shore.</i>

535
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:21,004
<i>Movin'closer...</i>

536
00:47:21,109 --> 00:47:25,011
<i>he saw that it was the wooden figure of a woman.</i>

537
00:47:25,113 --> 00:47:28,571
<i>Her body was growin'</i>
<i>out of a block of wood.</i>

538
00:47:28,683 --> 00:47:31,379
<i>A black woman...</i>

539
00:47:31,486 --> 00:47:34,353
With her arm lifted up
and her fist balled out.

540
00:47:34,455 --> 00:47:36,184
<i>Mmm.</i>

541
00:47:36,291 --> 00:47:40,284
<i>Obadiah knelt down on</i>
<i>the wet sand before her...</i>

542
00:47:40,395 --> 00:47:45,355
- and to his shock he heard her voice clear as day.
- <i>Mm-hmm!</i>

543
00:47:45,466 --> 00:47:50,426
- She said, "It's all right."
- "It's all right."

544
00:47:50,538 --> 00:47:52,062
- <i>"I'm here."</i>
- "I'm here."

545
00:47:52,173 --> 00:47:54,073
"I'll be taking care of you now."

546
00:47:54,175 --> 00:47:58,509
<i>And Obadiah knew at that moment</i>
<i>that God had sent her.</i>

547
00:48:00,348 --> 00:48:04,546
Now, everyone knew the mother of Jesus' name
was Mary, and that she was strong...

548
00:48:04,652 --> 00:48:09,453
- <i>Come on.</i>
- And constant and had a mother's heart.

549
00:48:09,557 --> 00:48:12,253
<i>And here she was...</i>

550
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:15,523
<i>sent to them across</i>
<i>the same waters...</i>

551
00:48:15,630 --> 00:48:18,793
<i>that had brought them</i>
<i>there in chains.</i>

552
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:22,267
- Seemed like she knew everything they suffered.
- Everything!

553
00:48:22,370 --> 00:48:26,898
<i>And so the people went up</i>
<i>one at a time...</i>

554
00:48:28,243 --> 00:48:31,269
and touched their hand
to her chest...

555
00:48:31,379 --> 00:48:35,713
wantin' to grab on to
the solace in her heart.

556
00:48:35,817 --> 00:48:39,913
- Mary filled their hearts with fearlessness.
- She filled their hearts!

557
00:48:40,021 --> 00:48:42,888
And if they ever grew weak...

558
00:48:42,991 --> 00:48:44,891
they had only to touch
her heart again.

559
00:48:44,993 --> 00:48:46,927
Touch her heart!

560
00:48:47,028 --> 00:48:49,826
- Touch her heart.
- Touch her heart.

561
00:49:37,645 --> 00:49:39,704
<i>Touch her heart.</i>

562
00:49:41,316 --> 00:49:43,682
Lily.

563
00:49:43,785 --> 00:49:47,277
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

564
00:49:47,388 --> 00:49:49,288
No!

565
00:49:49,390 --> 00:49:51,153
- I'm your husband!
- Lily!

566
00:49:51,259 --> 00:49:53,159
...and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

567
00:49:53,261 --> 00:49:54,956
<i>Just let me go!</i>

568
00:49:55,063 --> 00:49:57,531
No!

569
00:49:57,632 --> 00:50:01,068
<i>... pray for us sinners now...</i>

570
00:50:01,169 --> 00:50:03,228
and at the hour of our death.

571
00:50:03,338 --> 00:50:06,000
- <i>Amen.</i>
- Lily!

572
00:50:08,509 --> 00:50:11,239
No!

573
00:50:11,346 --> 00:50:13,371
<i>June, what's gotten into you?</i>

574
00:50:14,248 --> 00:50:17,775
Oh!

575
00:50:17,885 --> 00:50:19,876
Lily.

576
00:50:23,791 --> 00:50:25,759
Girl, since when
you started faintin'?

577
00:50:29,263 --> 00:50:31,163
Could I get some water?

578
00:50:32,266 --> 00:50:35,531
- Of course.
- Wait. Um...

579
00:50:35,636 --> 00:50:37,729
Rosaleen, could you get it, please?

580
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:54,788
This your room?

581
00:50:56,290 --> 00:51:00,727
- Blue is my favorite color.
- Mine too.

582
00:51:00,828 --> 00:51:03,388
Birds of a feather.

583
00:51:03,498 --> 00:51:07,298
- Sorry I messed up your church.
- Oh, that's all right.

584
00:51:07,402 --> 00:51:10,769
We go on all day if somebody
don't stop us.

585
00:51:10,872 --> 00:51:12,772
I just hope you all right.

586
00:51:18,379 --> 00:51:20,279
I think it was the heat.

587
00:51:21,449 --> 00:51:23,815
<i>Felt like it was</i>
<i>90 degrees in there.</i>

588
00:51:27,855 --> 00:51:30,483
Yes, the heat.

589
00:51:32,293 --> 00:51:35,751
Heat'll make a person
do strange things.

590
00:52:03,509 --> 00:52:07,946
I've made my reservation
I'm leaving town tomorrow

591
00:52:08,047 --> 00:52:10,248
I'll find somebody new
and there'll be no more sorrow

592
00:52:12,551 --> 00:52:15,019
That's what I do each time
but I can't follow through

593
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:19,420
I can't break away
though you make me cry

594
00:52:19,525 --> 00:52:23,928
I can't break away
I can't say good-bye

595
00:52:24,029 --> 00:52:27,726
No, I'll never, ever
break away from you

596
00:52:27,833 --> 00:52:31,360
No, no
No, no, no, no

597
00:52:31,470 --> 00:52:33,665
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no

598
00:52:33,772 --> 00:52:36,639
Who can think with all that?

599
00:52:36,742 --> 00:52:41,577
<i>Well, that's your problem...</i>
<i>You think too much.</i>

600
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:45,343
Try going with your feelings
once in a blue moon.

601
00:52:45,451 --> 00:52:47,419
You won't believe what
people in town are sayin'.

602
00:52:47,519 --> 00:52:51,683
Sayin' Jack Palance is coming to Tiburon,
and he's bringing a Negro woman with him.

603
00:52:51,790 --> 00:52:53,451
<i>What in the world?</i>

604
00:52:53,559 --> 00:52:57,086
- Who's Jack Palance?
- He's a movie star... a white one.

605
00:52:57,196 --> 00:53:00,597
I ain't never heard...
l... I have never heard of him.

606
00:53:00,699 --> 00:53:02,894
<i>They say his sister lives here.</i>
<i>He's comin' to visit her...</i>

607
00:53:03,002 --> 00:53:05,368
and he intend to take this woman
to the theater on Friday.

608
00:53:05,471 --> 00:53:09,373
- <i>White folks talkin' about standin' guard outside.</i>
- <i> That's just talk.</i>

609
00:53:09,475 --> 00:53:11,272
<i>And these idiots are determined</i>
<i>to fight this law till they...</i>

610
00:53:11,377 --> 00:53:12,867
Shh, shh, shh. Shh.

611
00:53:16,448 --> 00:53:17,915
- Miss May?
- Mm-hmm?

612
00:53:18,017 --> 00:53:21,077
I saw how nice you did
Rosaleen's hair...

613
00:53:21,186 --> 00:53:24,087
and I was wonderin' if maybe
you could help me with mine.

614
00:53:26,191 --> 00:53:27,806
That'll be easy.

615
00:53:29,374 --> 00:53:31,274
<i>Hmm.</i>

616
00:53:37,761 --> 00:53:40,821
It's ironic how white people
hate us so much...

617
00:53:40,931 --> 00:53:43,297
when so many of 'em
been raised by black women.

618
00:53:45,235 --> 00:53:47,897
- Place a beehive on my grave
- Ooh.

619
00:53:49,239 --> 00:53:52,970
June Bug! June, I know you hear me.

620
00:53:53,076 --> 00:53:55,840
If I make this shot, you'll give me your hand?
Watch this.

621
00:54:00,984 --> 00:54:02,975
<i>What you laughin' at?</i>

622
00:54:08,792 --> 00:54:12,023
You think somethin' bein' an impossibility
makes you think about it even more?

623
00:54:12,128 --> 00:54:14,596
- Like what?
- I don't know.

624
00:54:14,698 --> 00:54:17,223
Like... kissin'.

625
00:54:17,334 --> 00:54:19,962
That ain't impossible.

626
00:54:20,070 --> 00:54:24,063
When I was 15, I made
a 7 UP cake for this boy.

627
00:54:24,174 --> 00:54:26,904
After that,
he kissed me all the time.

628
00:54:27,010 --> 00:54:29,103
What'd it feel like?

629
00:54:29,212 --> 00:54:31,373
Like I was gonna burst.

630
00:54:36,186 --> 00:54:39,019
Miss May, I know you get
real sad sometimes.

631
00:54:40,056 --> 00:54:43,150
My daddy never feels.

632
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:46,058
He never felt anything.

633
00:54:46,162 --> 00:54:48,596
I had rather be like you.

634
00:54:53,570 --> 00:54:56,232
A worker bee weigh less
than a flower petal...

635
00:54:56,339 --> 00:55:00,901
but she can fly with a load
heavier than her.

636
00:55:01,011 --> 00:55:04,572
But she only lives
four or five weeks.

637
00:55:06,283 --> 00:55:10,652
Sometimes not feelin' is
the only way you can survive.

638
00:55:19,829 --> 00:55:22,457
You want me to help you
make a 7 UP cake?

639
00:55:24,134 --> 00:55:27,126
Hold that.

640
00:55:40,717 --> 00:55:43,515
- It's purple.
- Yeah.

641
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:47,351
When the weather turns hot,
the flowers, they start to dry up.

642
00:55:47,457 --> 00:55:49,925
The bees, they start sucking
on that elderberry.

643
00:55:50,961 --> 00:55:52,986
That makes purple honey.

644
00:55:54,130 --> 00:55:57,122
There. See?

645
00:55:57,233 --> 00:56:01,135
People'll pay two dollars a jar
for purple honey.

646
00:56:50,086 --> 00:56:51,986
- <i> I'm so lonely</i>
- You all right?

647
00:56:52,088 --> 00:56:54,147
<i> She'll be fine.</i>

648
00:56:56,359 --> 00:56:58,190
- <i> Because.</i>
- <i> No. Why?</i>

649
00:56:58,294 --> 00:57:00,990
- Why does it always have to come back to this?
- Because I love you and you me.

650
00:57:01,097 --> 00:57:02,797
Neil, I don't wanna get married.
I don't wanna get married.

651
00:57:02,798 --> 00:57:04,498
That's what people in love do.

652
00:57:04,601 --> 00:57:05,835
I don't wanna be married today
or tomorrow or ever.

653
00:57:05,836 --> 00:57:07,069
It's about that time!

654
00:57:07,170 --> 00:57:09,570
- What are you so scared of?
- I'm not scared of anything!

655
00:57:13,209 --> 00:57:15,575
Then you are the most
selfish bitch I ever met.

656
00:57:19,182 --> 00:57:21,082
What?

657
00:57:21,184 --> 00:57:23,084
What did you just say to me?

658
00:57:23,186 --> 00:57:25,450
- Oh, Lord.
- <i>What did you just call me?</i>

659
00:57:25,555 --> 00:57:28,251
<i>How dare you call me that, Neil.</i>
<i>Neil, I'm talkin' to you.</i>

660
00:57:28,358 --> 00:57:30,918
You better turn around
and listen to me right now.

661
00:57:31,027 --> 00:57:33,052
You better come back here
and apologize right now!

662
00:57:33,163 --> 00:57:36,599
<i>Don't you ever plan on comin' back then!</i>
<i>I don't even need you in my life!</i>

663
00:57:37,801 --> 00:57:40,861
How dare... Don't come back!

664
00:57:40,970 --> 00:57:43,962
- <i> Don't worry, May.</i>
- <i> Don't come back!</i>

665
00:57:49,045 --> 00:57:51,912
<i> I bet they'll be back holdin' hands</i>
<i>on the porch swing tomorrow.</i>

666
00:57:52,015 --> 00:57:56,714
I don't know, Lily.
Some people rather die than forgive.

667
00:57:56,820 --> 00:57:58,981
And June is one of 'em.

668
00:57:59,089 --> 00:58:03,355
She still hasn't forgiven me for paintin'
the house, and that was 10 years ago.

669
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:06,952
Well, how come, if your favorite color is blue,
you painted the house so pink?

670
00:58:07,063 --> 00:58:09,395
That was May's doin'.

671
00:58:09,499 --> 00:58:11,899
She was with me the day
I went to the paint store...

672
00:58:12,001 --> 00:58:15,903
and she latched onto this sample
called Caribbean Pink.

673
00:58:16,005 --> 00:58:19,998
Said it made her wanna dance
a Spanish flamenco.

674
00:58:20,110 --> 00:58:23,705
I thought it was the tackiest color
I ever seen in my life.

675
00:58:23,813 --> 00:58:27,681
But if it could lift May's heart,
then I guess she ought to live in it.

676
00:58:27,784 --> 00:58:29,752
Well, that was sure nice of you.

677
00:58:29,853 --> 00:58:33,380
Well, some things
don't matter that much, Lily.

678
00:58:33,490 --> 00:58:36,357
Like the color
of a house and whatnot.

679
00:58:36,459 --> 00:58:39,087
But liftin' someone's heart...
now <i>that</i> matters.

680
00:58:40,597 --> 00:58:44,124
- Were you ever in love?
- Course I was.

681
00:58:44,234 --> 00:58:47,169
- But you didn't love him enough to marry him.
- Well, I loved him enough.

682
00:58:47,270 --> 00:58:50,433
I just loved my freedom more.

683
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:55,136
I can't think of one thing I'd rather have
than somebody loving me.

684
00:58:59,315 --> 00:59:00,805
Where are all the bees?

685
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:08,667
You hear that?

686
00:59:08,769 --> 00:59:10,964
They're coolin' the hive.

687
00:59:11,072 --> 00:59:15,008
That's the sound of 100,000
bee wings fannin' the air.

688
00:59:18,145 --> 00:59:22,605
People have no idea about the complicated life
goin' on inside a beehive.

689
00:59:22,717 --> 00:59:24,981
Here. Let me help you with that.

690
00:59:25,086 --> 00:59:29,955
See, bees have a secret life
we don't know anything about.

691
00:59:41,235 --> 00:59:43,169
<i>Yeah!</i>

692
00:59:44,505 --> 00:59:47,065
<i>Well, if this ain't the livin' end.</i>

693
00:59:47,174 --> 00:59:48,835
Now come over here. You gonna get wet.

694
00:59:48,943 --> 00:59:52,071
Oh, Lord, Lord!

695
00:59:54,949 --> 00:59:59,386
Would you keep it down?

696
00:59:59,487 --> 01:00:03,184
- Keep it down! I'm practicin'.
- You come over here, you gonna get wet.

697
01:00:05,026 --> 01:00:07,654
- Oh, damn it to hell!
- Run, Lily!

698
01:00:07,762 --> 01:00:09,730
Oh, damn it to hell!

699
01:00:12,099 --> 01:00:14,693
How dare you!

700
01:00:14,802 --> 01:00:17,327
- <i> You out of your mind?</i>
- All right now, June.

701
01:00:20,341 --> 01:00:22,502
<i>Come on, June.</i>

702
01:01:24,405 --> 01:01:26,669
- Where you goin', June?
- June?

703
01:01:26,774 --> 01:01:29,208
Come on back.

704
01:01:36,183 --> 01:01:38,913
<i>Oh. Miss May.</i>

705
01:01:39,019 --> 01:01:41,954
Got thirsty.

706
01:01:59,733 --> 01:02:02,167
I saw a roach.

707
01:02:20,620 --> 01:02:25,148
<i>The roaches will</i>
<i>follow this right out the door.</i>

708
01:02:25,258 --> 01:02:27,522
Works every time.

709
01:02:30,764 --> 01:02:33,528
Miss May?

710
01:02:33,633 --> 01:02:35,897
Did you know a Deborah?

711
01:02:36,002 --> 01:02:37,902
Deborah Owens?

712
01:02:38,004 --> 01:02:41,405
<i>She's a white woman from Virginia.</i>

713
01:02:42,542 --> 01:02:45,306
It would've been a long time ago.

714
01:02:45,412 --> 01:02:47,676
Oh, yes.

715
01:02:47,781 --> 01:02:50,147
Deborah Owens.

716
01:02:50,250 --> 01:02:53,083
She stayed out in the honey house.

717
01:02:53,186 --> 01:02:56,417
She was the sweetest thing.

718
01:03:12,372 --> 01:03:15,170
Think I'll go out
to the wall for a while.

719
01:03:34,361 --> 01:03:37,262
Give it back!

720
01:03:42,936 --> 01:03:45,370
<i>Zach! Come back here.</i>

721
01:03:51,211 --> 01:03:53,111
Thank you.

722
01:03:56,583 --> 01:03:59,347
<i>Hey. Lily, come ride with me.</i>

723
01:03:59,452 --> 01:04:02,649
Uh, I gotta drop some honey off
to Mr. Forrest. I want you to meet him.

724
01:04:02,756 --> 01:04:05,156
Oh, I gotta talk to Miss August.
You know where she is?

725
01:04:05,258 --> 01:04:09,251
Uh, she went to Columbia to go pick up
a new blade for the spinner.

726
01:04:09,362 --> 01:04:11,262
Oh.

727
01:04:22,675 --> 01:04:27,112
<i>Thought a new notebook might</i>
<i>help you start writin' again.</i>

728
01:04:29,916 --> 01:04:31,816
Whoa.

729
01:04:39,526 --> 01:04:42,324
My mother stayed in
the honey house, just like me.

730
01:04:42,429 --> 01:04:45,626
What? When?

731
01:04:45,732 --> 01:04:48,929
I don't know.
I don't know anything about her.

732
01:04:49,035 --> 01:04:53,631
Maybe it was before I was born.
Or maybe she left me like my daddy said.

733
01:04:53,740 --> 01:04:55,640
So, wait.

734
01:04:57,410 --> 01:04:59,640
You mean to tell me...

735
01:04:59,746 --> 01:05:02,180
all that stuff about your aunt...

736
01:05:02,282 --> 01:05:04,876
and... and just passin' through...

737
01:05:04,984 --> 01:05:07,282
You made that up?

738
01:05:09,022 --> 01:05:11,286
Why not just tell the truth?

739
01:05:12,826 --> 01:05:15,192
'Cause I'm afraid the truth
is gonna wreck everything.

740
01:05:39,986 --> 01:05:41,886
<i>There he is.</i>

741
01:05:41,988 --> 01:05:43,819
And who might
this pretty young lady be?

742
01:05:43,923 --> 01:05:47,017
This is Lily.
She's stayin' with Miss August.

743
01:05:47,126 --> 01:05:50,323
- You stayin' in her house?
- Yes, ma'am.

744
01:05:50,430 --> 01:05:54,730
Well, Miss August is a good friend of mine.
I hope you're enjoyin' yourself.

745
01:05:54,834 --> 01:05:57,667
- Yes, sir.
- I have an appointment with the dentist.

746
01:05:57,770 --> 01:05:59,567
Okay.

747
01:05:59,672 --> 01:06:04,075
- <i> What you working on?</i>
- <i>Run-of-the-mill stuff.</i>

748
01:06:04,177 --> 01:06:07,578
<i>Hey, I got somethin' for you.</i>
<i>Wanna head up to the office?</i>

749
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:10,410
Are you, uh, lookin' forward
to school gettin' started up?

750
01:06:10,411 --> 01:06:13,141
Yes, sir. And football season...

751
01:06:13,253 --> 01:06:15,483
Oh, yeah.
We're lookin' forward to that.

752
01:06:49,556 --> 01:06:51,456
Hello. Operator.

753
01:06:51,558 --> 01:06:54,925
I'd like to make a call
to Sylvan 7-1710.

754
01:06:55,028 --> 01:06:57,963
Hold while I connect
your call, please.

755
01:07:02,368 --> 01:07:05,394
Hello? Hello!

756
01:07:10,910 --> 01:07:14,676
Look what he gave me.
I'm startin' my law library.

757
01:07:14,781 --> 01:07:16,942
That's nice.

758
01:07:17,050 --> 01:07:18,950
Hey.

759
01:07:21,921 --> 01:07:25,152
Lily, I know you're scared
the truth is gonna wreck things.

760
01:07:25,258 --> 01:07:27,988
Findin' out the truth
is only half of it.

761
01:07:29,195 --> 01:07:32,028
It's what you do with it
that matters.

762
01:07:32,131 --> 01:07:34,031
Right?

763
01:07:41,474 --> 01:07:43,806
When's the last time
you seen a movie?

764
01:07:43,910 --> 01:07:45,810
I don't remember.

765
01:07:45,912 --> 01:07:48,039
Come on. We gonna go see <i>Surf Party.</i>

766
01:07:48,147 --> 01:07:51,605
- But what...
- But nothin'. Come on. Let's go.

767
01:08:00,126 --> 01:08:01,923
- One adult, please.
- Here you go.

768
01:08:03,771 --> 01:08:04,863
It can't hurt, you know?

769
01:08:08,843 --> 01:08:10,834
<i>One adult and one child.</i>

770
01:08:13,314 --> 01:08:15,544
<i>Everybody waxed up?</i>

771
01:08:15,649 --> 01:08:19,415
- <i>This is a surfboard.</i>
- <i> You're kidding.</i>

772
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:22,978
<i>This is the nose.</i>
<i>The sides are called rails.</i>

773
01:08:24,692 --> 01:08:26,660
Thank you.

774
01:08:29,763 --> 01:08:32,129
- <i>The first step</i> is...
- <i> Come on!</i>

775
01:08:32,933 --> 01:08:35,367
Hey, boy!

776
01:08:35,469 --> 01:08:38,029
- We're gonna teach you a lesson, boy!
- Hey! It's not his fault!

777
01:08:38,139 --> 01:08:39,868
Let him go!

778
01:08:39,974 --> 01:08:42,738
Shut your mouth, nigger lover!

779
01:08:42,843 --> 01:08:46,870
- <i> Where are they takin' him?</i>
- Get him in the truck.

780
01:08:46,981 --> 01:08:49,745
- Just trying to gather up all the pieces.
- You're wastin' time!

781
01:08:49,850 --> 01:08:51,750
- You know who took him.
- Is that right?

782
01:08:51,852 --> 01:08:54,320
- <i>Yeah, that's right.</i>
- All right. Now hold on here, folks.

783
01:08:54,421 --> 01:08:56,855
<i>Soon as we know anything,</i>
<i>we'll get back to you.</i>

784
01:08:56,957 --> 01:08:59,687
Neil, counselor, ladies.
Come on. Let's go.

785
01:09:02,630 --> 01:09:06,066
I'm gonna get some men together.
We'll look ourselves.

786
01:09:06,167 --> 01:09:08,829
If you'll have me,
I'm willin' to help.

787
01:09:16,343 --> 01:09:18,368
May doesn't need to know about this.

788
01:09:23,184 --> 01:09:25,914
Nah, it'll be too much.

789
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:35,620
<i>Black boys don't come back, August.</i>

790
01:09:35,729 --> 01:09:39,130
<i> He's gonna be found,</i>
<i>and he's gonna be all right.</i>

791
01:09:39,233 --> 01:09:41,929
- <i> How could you say that?</i>
- <i>I have to.</i>

792
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:02,985
Please let him be okay.

793
01:10:23,444 --> 01:10:25,435
Lily's gonna look so pretty in this.

794
01:10:31,252 --> 01:10:33,982
August, where are your scissors?

795
01:10:35,689 --> 01:10:37,486
Uh, in my room.

796
01:10:50,337 --> 01:10:54,000
- <i>Hey, Greta.</i>
- Hey, May.

797
01:10:54,108 --> 01:10:56,008
You been to see Mary?

798
01:10:57,044 --> 01:10:58,978
Zach is still missin'.

799
01:11:03,784 --> 01:11:06,981
We have to pray, May.
You understand?

800
01:11:07,087 --> 01:11:09,282
We got to pray, May.

801
01:11:35,149 --> 01:11:38,550
- <i> Who was at the door?</i>
- <i>May, was somebody at the door?</i>

802
01:11:41,722 --> 01:11:43,622
Greta.

803
01:11:44,892 --> 01:11:47,292
No news on Zach.

804
01:11:56,437 --> 01:11:58,905
Why didn't you tell me?

805
01:12:00,741 --> 01:12:03,539
You all right?

806
01:12:05,779 --> 01:12:08,247
May?

807
01:12:08,349 --> 01:12:10,442
May!

808
01:12:11,552 --> 01:12:13,179
<i>Answer me, May.</i>
<i>You all right?</i>

809
01:12:13,287 --> 01:12:15,755
What's happened to her?
I never seen her like this.

810
01:12:15,856 --> 01:12:19,656
- May?
- May?

811
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:21,660
May.

812
01:12:23,797 --> 01:12:25,788
I'm all right.

813
01:12:28,068 --> 01:12:30,195
Glad to see you can talk.

814
01:12:31,739 --> 01:12:34,071
Come on, Sister.

815
01:12:34,174 --> 01:12:36,506
We gonna run you a nice hot bath.

816
01:12:37,878 --> 01:12:40,438
I need to go to the wall.

817
01:12:51,291 --> 01:12:53,191
May?

818
01:12:53,293 --> 01:12:55,727
Where's May?
Her bath is ready.

819
01:12:55,829 --> 01:12:57,990
She's still out there.

820
01:13:04,605 --> 01:13:06,664
May?

821
01:13:08,075 --> 01:13:09,975
May?

822
01:13:11,545 --> 01:13:13,445
May!

823
01:13:16,650 --> 01:13:18,675
May?

824
01:13:19,820 --> 01:13:22,015
<i>May!</i>

825
01:13:22,122 --> 01:13:24,420
- May?
- <i>May!</i>

826
01:13:26,293 --> 01:13:28,784
- May?
- <i>May!</i>

827
01:13:31,365 --> 01:13:33,856
<i>Come on, May.</i>

828
01:13:40,774 --> 01:13:42,674
<i>May?</i>

829
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:48,380
<i>May?</i>

830
01:13:51,585 --> 01:13:53,485
June?

831
01:13:56,156 --> 01:13:58,454
<i>May!</i>

832
01:14:05,332 --> 01:14:10,031
<i>June! June!</i>
<i></i>

833
01:14:10,137 --> 01:14:12,799
May!

834
01:14:12,906 --> 01:14:16,239
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God! August!

835
01:14:19,346 --> 01:14:21,541
August.

836
01:14:32,626 --> 01:14:37,063
No!
Oh, no!

837
01:14:37,164 --> 01:14:40,327
- Oh, no!
- Oh, May.

838
01:14:43,270 --> 01:14:46,671
<i> We gotta get her out.</i>
<i>We gotta get her out.</i>

839
01:14:54,147 --> 01:14:59,050
<i>May!</i>

840
01:14:59,152 --> 01:15:01,313
Why you do that?

841
01:16:06,553 --> 01:16:08,919
Sweet Mary.

842
01:16:16,496 --> 01:16:18,964
<i>Zach!</i>

843
01:16:20,934 --> 01:16:23,095
Zach.

844
01:16:27,074 --> 01:16:29,599
<i>Oh.</i>

845
01:16:29,710 --> 01:16:31,610
I'm so sorry.

846
01:16:31,712 --> 01:16:33,771
Miss May did what she did
'cause of me.

847
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:36,474
<i>Come on, now.</i>
<i>It was May who did it.</i>

848
01:16:36,583 --> 01:16:39,984
It's all right.
She wouldn't want you blaming yourself.

849
01:16:44,191 --> 01:16:46,489
Oh. It's gonna be okay.

850
01:16:49,696 --> 01:16:51,755
It's good. It's good.

851
01:17:20,127 --> 01:17:23,619
<i>Dear August and June...</i>

852
01:17:23,730 --> 01:17:26,858
<i>I'm sorry to leave you like this.</i>

853
01:17:26,967 --> 01:17:29,595
<i>But I know Zach is okay.</i>

854
01:17:29,703 --> 01:17:32,570
<i>My heart is telling me so.</i>

855
01:17:32,673 --> 01:17:34,573
<i>I hate you bein'sad...</i>

856
01:17:34,675 --> 01:17:38,736
<i>but think how happy I'll be</i>
<i>with April, Mama and Papa.</i>

857
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:42,947
<i>I'm tired of carrying around</i>
<i>the weight of the world.</i>

858
01:17:43,050 --> 01:17:45,109
<i>I'm just gonna lay it down now.</i>

859
01:17:46,753 --> 01:17:48,653
<i>It's my time to die...</i>

860
01:17:48,755 --> 01:17:51,451
<i>and it's your time to live.</i>

861
01:17:51,558 --> 01:17:54,686
<i>Don't mess it up.</i>

862
01:17:55,896 --> 01:17:57,454
<i>Love, May.</i>

863
01:18:10,677 --> 01:18:12,577
<i>I saw Mary</i>

864
01:18:12,679 --> 01:18:15,842
<i>She was walkin' on the water</i>

865
01:18:15,949 --> 01:18:18,611
<i>Smilin' at me</i>

866
01:18:18,719 --> 01:18:22,917
<i>Hummin' her river song</i>

867
01:18:23,023 --> 01:18:24,923
<i>And I tried wavin'</i>

868
01:18:25,025 --> 01:18:27,755
<i>But she was walkin' away</i>

869
01:18:27,861 --> 01:18:31,524
<i>She said that</i>
<i>she'd been waitin' on me</i>

870
01:18:31,631 --> 01:18:35,294
<i>All day long</i>

871
01:18:46,913 --> 01:18:51,612
<i>I tried to call her and said</i>
<i>Please come back</i>

872
01:18:51,718 --> 01:18:57,088
<i>'Cause I didn't mean</i>
<i>to make you sad</i>

873
01:18:57,190 --> 01:18:59,090
<i>She said</i>

874
01:18:59,192 --> 01:19:03,526
<i>Well, don't you worry</i>
<i>'cause I'll see you again</i>

875
01:19:03,630 --> 01:19:06,656
<i>But I hear my mother call</i>

876
01:19:06,767 --> 01:19:09,736
<i>And I have to go</i>

877
01:20:04,191 --> 01:20:09,356
Place a beehive on my grave

878
01:20:09,462 --> 01:20:13,057
And let the honey
soak through

879
01:20:14,501 --> 01:20:18,369
When I'm dead and gone

880
01:20:18,471 --> 01:20:23,101
That's what I want from you

881
01:20:23,210 --> 01:20:28,170
The streets of heaven
are gold and sunny

882
01:20:28,281 --> 01:20:31,011
But I'll stick with my plot

883
01:20:31,117 --> 01:20:34,484
And a pot of honey

884
01:20:34,588 --> 01:20:39,150
Place a beehive on my grave

885
01:20:39,259 --> 01:20:43,252
And let the honey
soak through

886
01:20:46,533 --> 01:20:48,433
Hmm.

887
01:20:53,740 --> 01:20:55,640
<i>I see you liked yours.</i>

888
01:20:55,742 --> 01:20:57,573
- Mm-hmm. It's the last one.
- Mmm.

889
01:20:57,677 --> 01:20:59,736
Mmm, girl, you did all right.

890
01:20:59,846 --> 01:21:02,371
Aw. I'm the eldest.

891
01:21:02,482 --> 01:21:05,246
- And the slowest.
- I'll make some more.

892
01:21:05,352 --> 01:21:08,412
- You hear that, June?
- Hmm.

893
01:21:08,521 --> 01:21:12,252
Think we might need
to change your name, Rosaleen.

894
01:21:12,359 --> 01:21:16,056
From now on, we gonna call you July.

895
01:21:18,265 --> 01:21:21,428
<i>Hmm. I concur.</i>

896
01:21:23,203 --> 01:21:25,569
<i>Some more of these.</i>

897
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:30,134
<i>Mmm.</i>

898
01:21:35,115 --> 01:21:37,777
Sure you gonna be
all right in here by yourself?

899
01:21:43,290 --> 01:21:45,588
I don't mind sharing May's room.

900
01:21:45,692 --> 01:21:48,593
Just wanna be near her spirit.

901
01:21:48,695 --> 01:21:50,595
I'll be fine.

902
01:21:52,799 --> 01:21:54,699
See you in the mornin' then.

903
01:22:24,898 --> 01:22:26,798
Hey, Lily.

904
01:22:27,901 --> 01:22:30,199
This is my mother.

905
01:22:37,911 --> 01:22:39,811
I know, honey.

906
01:22:41,214 --> 01:22:45,048
Your mama was
Deborah Fontanel Owens.

907
01:22:45,151 --> 01:22:47,051
You've known all this time?

908
01:22:47,153 --> 01:22:50,987
I knew she had a daughter.
But I thought it couldn't be you.

909
01:22:51,091 --> 01:22:55,858
But one look at you,
all I could see is Deborah at your age.

910
01:22:55,962 --> 01:22:57,759
You knew her when she was little?

911
01:22:57,864 --> 01:23:00,833
I took care of her.

912
01:23:00,934 --> 01:23:03,596
Why didn't you tell me?

913
01:23:03,703 --> 01:23:07,036
Somethin' told me you wasn't
quite ready to know about her.

914
01:23:07,140 --> 01:23:12,043
I just wanted to give you a chance
to get on solid ground first.

915
01:23:14,647 --> 01:23:16,808
T. Ray...

916
01:23:16,916 --> 01:23:18,941
he told me that my mo...

917
01:23:20,253 --> 01:23:23,450
He told me my mother
left me and ran away.

918
01:23:26,259 --> 01:23:29,490
I don't have any memory of her, but...

919
01:23:29,596 --> 01:23:33,896
I know he's lyin'
'cause some things aren't possible.

920
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,560
Children just don't have two parents
who refuse to love 'em.

921
01:23:36,669 --> 01:23:40,127
Is that what made you leave?

922
01:23:40,240 --> 01:23:44,438
I know what I did was wrong.
I just seem to do all the wrong things.

923
01:23:46,146 --> 01:23:49,274
I don't mean to be a bad person,
but I just can't help it.

924
01:23:49,382 --> 01:23:53,580
So that's why I gotta go.
I brought the outside in here.

925
01:23:53,686 --> 01:23:56,814
And what happened
to Zach and Miss May...

926
01:23:56,923 --> 01:23:59,949
If I'd never come here,
it would've never happened.

927
01:24:00,060 --> 01:24:02,153
- Lily... Lily, that wasn't your fault.
- I wreck everything.

928
01:24:02,262 --> 01:24:04,321
Yes, it was.

929
01:24:04,431 --> 01:24:08,231
They were fightin' and screamin' and...

930
01:24:08,334 --> 01:24:12,065
She grabbed a gun, and he took it away from her,
and I just wanted to help her.

931
01:24:12,172 --> 01:24:14,868
I just wanted to
give it back to her.

932
01:24:14,974 --> 01:24:17,238
- And I killed her.
- Who, Lily?

933
01:24:17,343 --> 01:24:20,642
My mother.
I killed my mother.

934
01:24:22,382 --> 01:24:25,010
I'm unlovable.

935
01:24:31,191 --> 01:24:33,318
Oh, Lily.

936
01:24:34,594 --> 01:24:36,494
You listen to me now.

937
01:24:39,566 --> 01:24:42,467
That's a terrible,
terrible thing for you to live with.

938
01:24:44,003 --> 01:24:47,404
But you're not unlovable, child.

939
01:24:47,507 --> 01:24:49,805
There's love all around you.

940
01:24:53,713 --> 01:24:56,375
Gimme your hand.

941
01:25:03,253 --> 01:25:06,814
<i>I started takin' care of Deborah</i>
<i>when she was nine, back in Virginia.</i>

942
01:25:06,924 --> 01:25:08,915
<i>Over seven years.</i>

943
01:25:09,026 --> 01:25:12,962
<i>Till my grandmama died</i>
<i>and left me this place.</i>

944
01:25:13,063 --> 01:25:16,521
That's why June
resented you at first.

945
01:25:16,633 --> 01:25:20,364
She never got over me
workin' in your mama's house.

946
01:25:20,471 --> 01:25:22,371
How did my mother get down here?

947
01:25:24,475 --> 01:25:28,036
She had an old friend from high school,
moved to Sylvan.

948
01:25:28,145 --> 01:25:32,172
Told her there were jobs,
and men back from the war.

949
01:25:32,282 --> 01:25:34,250
So she moved.

950
01:25:34,351 --> 01:25:36,410
I think it was 'cause of me though.

951
01:25:36,520 --> 01:25:39,284
I just think she wanted me nearby.

952
01:25:39,390 --> 01:25:43,952
So my mother came to Sylvan,
met T. Ray and got married.

953
01:25:44,061 --> 01:25:45,961
That's right.

954
01:25:46,063 --> 01:25:48,122
But what I don't get
is why she married him.

955
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:54,664
I think Deborah liked the fact
that he was decorated in the war.

956
01:25:54,772 --> 01:25:56,672
She thought he was brave.

957
01:25:56,774 --> 01:25:58,833
Said he treated her like a princess.

958
01:25:58,942 --> 01:26:01,536
It's not the same T. Ray.
I can tell you that right now.

959
01:26:03,747 --> 01:26:07,239
You know, Lily,
people can start out one way...

960
01:26:07,351 --> 01:26:12,516
<i>and by the time life get through with 'em,</i>
<i>end up completely different.</i>

961
01:26:12,623 --> 01:26:16,719
<i>I mean, I don't doubt that he started off</i>
<i>lovin' her. Fact, he worshipped her.</i>

962
01:26:16,827 --> 01:26:22,026
<i>But after about six months or so,</i>
<i>her love wore off.</i>

963
01:26:22,132 --> 01:26:24,396
But she married him?

964
01:26:24,501 --> 01:26:27,902
<i>But if the love had worn off,</i>
<i>why did she marry him?</i>

965
01:26:29,873 --> 01:26:33,365
Honey, Deborah was pregnant.

966
01:26:33,477 --> 01:26:35,377
That's why.

967
01:26:42,252 --> 01:26:44,220
She called me
soon after you were born.

968
01:26:44,321 --> 01:26:48,223
<i>I got letters and phone calls,</i>
<i>mostly about you.</i>

969
01:26:48,325 --> 01:26:52,921
How you were sittin' up
and takin' your first steps.

970
01:26:53,030 --> 01:26:55,464
<i>Playin' patty-cake.</i>

971
01:26:56,800 --> 01:27:01,134
<i>But then the letters</i>
<i>start comin' less and less.</i>

972
01:27:01,238 --> 01:27:03,798
And one day she called me up...

973
01:27:03,907 --> 01:27:06,774
and she said she was leavin' T. Ray.

974
01:27:06,877 --> 01:27:09,038
- Thank you.
- Yes, ma'am.

975
01:27:09,146 --> 01:27:12,309
<i> When I picked her up</i>
<i>from the bus station...</i>

976
01:27:12,416 --> 01:27:14,316
<i>she didn't even look like herself.</i>

977
01:27:15,586 --> 01:27:17,486
<i>She had gotten so thin.</i>

978
01:27:17,588 --> 01:27:20,682
I was with her when you picked her up
from the bus station, right?

979
01:27:23,093 --> 01:27:25,027
<i>She brought me along, didn't she?</i>

980
01:27:28,465 --> 01:27:30,831
<i>No. She came by herself, honey.</i>

981
01:27:34,605 --> 01:27:37,335
<i>Why?</i>

982
01:27:37,441 --> 01:27:39,341
Why didn't she bring me?

983
01:27:41,645 --> 01:27:45,342
All I know, Lily,
is she was fallin' apart.

984
01:27:45,449 --> 01:27:47,349
Depressed people do things
they wouldn't ordinarily do.

985
01:27:47,451 --> 01:27:50,818
It was easy for her to leave me
'cause she never wanted me in the first place.

986
01:27:50,921 --> 01:27:52,821
Lily.

987
01:27:54,892 --> 01:27:57,725
<i>After she was here</i>
<i>for a few months...</i>

988
01:27:57,828 --> 01:28:01,525
and started feelin' better, she...
she start talkin' about how much she missed you.

989
01:28:03,467 --> 01:28:05,697
Then she went back
to Sylvan to see you.

990
01:28:06,803 --> 01:28:09,397
She was just comin' for her things.

991
01:28:09,506 --> 01:28:13,306
- I believe she came back for you.
- I'm goin' to bed.

992
01:28:13,410 --> 01:28:14,900
<i>Lily!</i>

993
01:28:15,012 --> 01:28:18,140
Now your mama
made a terrible mistake.

994
01:28:18,248 --> 01:28:20,148
But I believe she tried to fix it.

995
01:28:20,250 --> 01:28:22,150
Good night.

996
01:28:27,257 --> 01:28:30,055
Damn it, Deborah.

997
01:28:43,340 --> 01:28:44,898
I hate you!

998
01:28:45,008 --> 01:28:47,602
I hate your guts!

999
01:29:06,396 --> 01:29:08,864
Why didn't you love me?

1000
01:30:19,403 --> 01:30:21,303
Tiburon.

1001
01:30:25,075 --> 01:30:26,975
Lily.

1002
01:30:30,781 --> 01:30:33,011
What in Mary's name happened here?

1003
01:30:37,654 --> 01:30:39,554
Answer me.

1004
01:30:47,030 --> 01:30:49,521
T. Ray was right about my mother.

1005
01:30:51,768 --> 01:30:53,668
She left me.

1006
01:30:59,576 --> 01:31:02,238
<i>Hi.</i>

1007
01:31:02,346 --> 01:31:04,246
Hi.

1008
01:31:04,348 --> 01:31:07,283
I brought some
of your mama's belongings.

1009
01:31:12,482 --> 01:31:16,680
It's just a handful of things your mama left
when she went back to get you.

1010
01:31:19,522 --> 01:31:21,513
Been in this box...

1011
01:31:22,992 --> 01:31:25,187
10 years, I guess.

1012
01:31:27,564 --> 01:31:29,691
You really loved her.

1013
01:31:33,870 --> 01:31:37,271
It was complicated.
But, yes, I did.

1014
01:31:38,374 --> 01:31:41,275
How was it complicated?

1015
01:31:41,377 --> 01:31:43,709
I was her nanny.

1016
01:31:43,813 --> 01:31:47,044
Things were different
in her world than mine.

1017
01:31:49,752 --> 01:31:53,210
We like to think
that love is pure and limitless.

1018
01:31:53,323 --> 01:31:57,589
But love like that
can't exist in a hateful time.

1019
01:32:00,163 --> 01:32:02,996
But she made me love her anyway.

1020
01:32:05,835 --> 01:32:09,498
There is no perfect love, Lily.

1021
01:32:26,856 --> 01:32:29,188
Your mama's pocket mirror.

1022
01:32:30,860 --> 01:32:35,058
If you look in here,
you see your mama looking back at you.

1023
01:32:56,886 --> 01:32:58,820
Well, I'll be.

1024
01:33:05,294 --> 01:33:08,525
She was wearin' that pin
the day she got here.

1025
01:33:25,148 --> 01:33:27,173
There's just one last thing.

1026
01:34:09,025 --> 01:34:11,516
Hey.

1027
01:34:11,627 --> 01:34:13,595
Hey.

1028
01:34:23,673 --> 01:34:25,766
- What happened to you?
- What about it?

1029
01:34:25,875 --> 01:34:28,241
It changed you, didn't it?

1030
01:34:33,216 --> 01:34:37,585
Sometimes, Lily, l...

1031
01:34:37,687 --> 01:34:39,587
I get so angry.

1032
01:34:40,957 --> 01:34:43,187
I just want to kill somethin'.

1033
01:34:43,292 --> 01:34:46,159
The men that took you...

1034
01:34:46,262 --> 01:34:48,662
they're angry like that too.

1035
01:34:48,765 --> 01:34:50,926
Makes 'em mean.

1036
01:34:53,236 --> 01:34:55,761
You have to promise me, Zach,
that you won't be like them.

1037
01:34:55,872 --> 01:34:58,136
I don't want to.

1038
01:34:58,241 --> 01:35:00,766
Me either.

1039
01:35:26,969 --> 01:35:29,802
No way I'm not
becomin' a lawyer now.

1040
01:35:31,641 --> 01:35:34,769
I'm gonna be one of them drum majors
Dr. King talks about.

1041
01:35:34,877 --> 01:35:37,004
I know you will.

1042
01:35:37,113 --> 01:35:41,982
And... 10, maybe
15 years from now...

1043
01:35:43,252 --> 01:35:45,152
we'll be at your book signin'.

1044
01:36:03,372 --> 01:36:06,466
So don't forget our story, all right?

1045
01:36:08,444 --> 01:36:10,309
I won't.

1046
01:36:21,257 --> 01:36:25,023
<i>I have you know I am now a registered voter.</i>

1047
01:36:25,127 --> 01:36:27,322
- Really?
- I'll be castin' my vote for...

1048
01:36:27,430 --> 01:36:29,364
Lyndon Johnson and Hubert Humphrey.

1049
01:36:35,004 --> 01:36:37,165
I love you, Miss Rosaleen.

1050
01:36:51,487 --> 01:36:54,217
- Neil.
- Hello, ladies.

1051
01:37:12,508 --> 01:37:14,373
Hi.

1052
01:37:14,477 --> 01:37:17,344
Hi.

1053
01:37:17,446 --> 01:37:21,382
Didn't you call me here to talk?
I'm a little busy.

1054
01:37:21,484 --> 01:37:23,401
You ain't the only one busy.

1055
01:37:23,402 --> 01:37:25,318
I'm just supposed to stand
here and watch how busy you are?

1056
01:37:25,421 --> 01:37:26,752
No.

1057
01:37:34,397 --> 01:37:37,332
I was...

1058
01:37:41,404 --> 01:37:44,271
I was wonderin' if you'd be
willin' to ask again.

1059
01:37:44,373 --> 01:37:46,568
Ask what?

1060
01:37:49,979 --> 01:37:52,072
This supposed to be funny?

1061
01:38:02,191 --> 01:38:04,819
June Boatwright, will you marry me?

1062
01:38:09,699 --> 01:38:11,599
Yes.

1063
01:38:11,701 --> 01:38:13,794
Yes?

1064
01:38:15,071 --> 01:38:16,971
Yes? Yes?

1065
01:38:17,073 --> 01:38:19,701
Yes.

1066
01:38:23,446 --> 01:38:26,540
She said yes.

1067
01:38:26,649 --> 01:38:28,810
- Oh, my God.
- Good for you.

1068
01:38:28,918 --> 01:38:30,909
Come on. We're goin' to
the jewelry store right now...

1069
01:38:31,020 --> 01:38:33,181
pickin' out a ring before you
change your mind, all right?

1070
01:38:33,289 --> 01:38:35,416
What? You don't already have one?

1071
01:38:35,524 --> 01:38:37,424
Girl, come on.

1072
01:38:37,526 --> 01:38:39,790
How come you don't have one?

1073
01:39:08,224 --> 01:39:11,682
Well, well, well.
Look who's here.

1074
01:39:14,530 --> 01:39:16,521
Won't you come in?

1075
01:39:22,838 --> 01:39:25,068
<i>Well, all right, goddamn it.</i>

1076
01:39:25,174 --> 01:39:28,940
<i>You wanna pretend</i>
<i>I'm making a social visit, we'll pretend.</i>

1077
01:39:29,045 --> 01:39:31,843
I'm gonna take you out of here nice and quiet
or kickin' and screamin'.

1078
01:39:31,947 --> 01:39:34,006
<i>Don't matter which one to me.</i>

1079
01:39:34,116 --> 01:39:36,084
Have a seat if you want to.

1080
01:39:49,765 --> 01:39:51,790
So you been here the whole time?

1081
01:39:53,002 --> 01:39:54,902
With colored women?

1082
01:39:55,004 --> 01:39:58,030
- <i>Jesus Christ.</i>
- How'd you find me?

1083
01:40:00,709 --> 01:40:03,439
That map on your wall.

1084
01:40:03,546 --> 01:40:05,707
Came here, started askin' around.

1085
01:40:05,815 --> 01:40:10,081
Some old lady secretary at the law office
was more than happy to fill me in.

1086
01:40:13,556 --> 01:40:16,889
- Where's Rosaleen?
- She took off a long time ago.

1087
01:40:35,377 --> 01:40:38,710
Where'd you get that?

1088
01:40:38,814 --> 01:40:41,112
- Miss August gave it to me.
- Don't you lie to me.

1089
01:40:42,218 --> 01:40:44,118
I'm not lyin'.

1090
01:40:44,220 --> 01:40:46,654
She said it belonged to my...

1091
01:40:49,892 --> 01:40:53,328
I gave that pin to your mama
on her 22nd birthday.

1092
01:40:55,297 --> 01:40:58,095
Now you tell me right now.

1093
01:40:58,200 --> 01:41:00,862
- How'd this August woman get it?
- You gave this to my mother?

1094
01:41:00,970 --> 01:41:02,938
- Answer me.
- You did?

1095
01:41:05,541 --> 01:41:08,533
This is where my mother came
when she ran away from us.

1096
01:41:09,678 --> 01:41:11,873
She was wearin' it
the day she got here.

1097
01:41:22,758 --> 01:41:25,852
Miss August used to take care of her
when she was a little girl.

1098
01:41:36,105 --> 01:41:38,835
I looked for her
everywhere I could think.

1099
01:41:40,943 --> 01:41:42,877
And she was right here.

1100
01:41:44,413 --> 01:41:46,881
Jesus Christ, she was right here.

1101
01:41:59,428 --> 01:42:02,261
Goddamn you, Deborah!

1102
01:42:02,364 --> 01:42:04,229
You ain't leavin' me again!

1103
01:42:04,333 --> 01:42:06,198
Get back here!

1104
01:42:06,302 --> 01:42:08,497
T. Ray, it's me, Lily!

1105
01:42:08,604 --> 01:42:10,595
Daddy!

1106
01:42:26,088 --> 01:42:29,148
You... You look like her.

1107
01:42:37,466 --> 01:42:40,731
My whole life's
been nothin' but a hole...

1108
01:42:40,836 --> 01:42:43,669
where my mother should've been.

1109
01:42:43,772 --> 01:42:45,967
It left me always achin'.

1110
01:42:48,077 --> 01:42:50,272
But I never thought about
what it did to you.

1111
01:42:59,355 --> 01:43:01,949
- We're goin' home.
- I'm stayin' here.

1112
01:43:05,227 --> 01:43:07,991
<i>You think I'm gonna</i>
<i>walk out of here and leave you?</i>

1113
01:43:08,097 --> 01:43:10,088
I don't even know these damn people.

1114
01:43:10,199 --> 01:43:12,099
I know them.

1115
01:43:13,269 --> 01:43:15,396
And August Boatwright
is a good person.

1116
01:43:15,504 --> 01:43:18,234
<i>Now, what makes you think</i>
<i>she'd even want you here?</i>

1117
01:43:18,340 --> 01:43:21,571
Lily can have a home here
as long as she wants.

1118
01:43:24,980 --> 01:43:26,845
Lily said you'd run off.

1119
01:43:26,949 --> 01:43:29,349
Well, I guess I'm back now.

1120
01:43:29,451 --> 01:43:33,911
<i>Well, I don't really care</i>
<i>where you end up...</i>

1121
01:43:35,124 --> 01:43:37,058
but Lily's comin' with me.

1122
01:43:45,100 --> 01:43:47,000
Everybody all right?

1123
01:43:48,570 --> 01:43:50,538
We all right.

1124
01:43:50,639 --> 01:43:52,664
This is Mr. Owens...

1125
01:43:52,775 --> 01:43:54,675
Lily's father.

1126
01:43:54,777 --> 01:43:57,268
He came here for a visit.

1127
01:44:00,449 --> 01:44:02,849
<i>Mr. Owens...</i>

1128
01:44:02,951 --> 01:44:07,888
you'd be doing Lily and us
a big favor by leavin' her here.

1129
01:44:07,990 --> 01:44:11,949
I made her my apprentice beekeeper.
She learnin' the whole business.

1130
01:44:14,997 --> 01:44:16,862
We love Lily.

1131
01:44:18,634 --> 01:44:21,535
<i>We'll get her started in school.</i>

1132
01:44:21,637 --> 01:44:24,970
We'll take care of her.
I promise you that.

1133
01:44:34,083 --> 01:44:36,142
Well...

1134
01:44:38,520 --> 01:44:40,420
good riddance.

1135
01:45:09,218 --> 01:45:11,914
<i>Stop! Stop!</i>

1136
01:45:16,792 --> 01:45:20,728
The day my mother died, you said
she was only comin' back for her things.

1137
01:45:22,131 --> 01:45:24,258
Is that true?

1138
01:45:27,102 --> 01:45:29,002
No.

1139
01:45:30,439 --> 01:45:32,964
No. She was comin' for you.

1140
01:45:36,845 --> 01:45:38,938
Why did you lie?

1141
01:45:42,317 --> 01:45:44,512
'Cause she didn't come for me.

1142
01:46:20,389 --> 01:46:24,382
<i> I still tell myself</i>
<i>that when T. Ray drove away that day...</i>

1143
01:46:24,493 --> 01:46:27,621
<i>he wasn't sayin: "Good riddance."</i>

1144
01:46:27,729 --> 01:46:32,826
<i>He was sayin: "Lily, you are better off there</i>
<i>with all these mothers. "

1145
01:46:34,203 --> 01:46:38,469
<i>I have more mothers than</i>
<i>any three girls off the street.</i>

1146
01:46:39,775 --> 01:46:41,970
<i>They are the moons</i>
<i>shinin' over me.</i>

1147
01:46:48,016 --> 01:46:50,246
<i>I guess I have forgiven myself.</i>

1148
01:46:50,352 --> 01:46:55,153
<i>Although sometimes in the night,</i>
<i>my dreams will take me back to sadness...</i>

1149
01:46:55,257 --> 01:46:59,057
<i>and I have to wake up and forgive again.</i>

1150
01:46:59,161 --> 01:47:02,187
<i>But Mary is always there.</i>

1151
01:47:03,665 --> 01:47:06,133
<i>I feel her at unexpected moments.</i>

1152
01:47:07,503 --> 01:47:09,698
<i>She will suddenly rise.</i>

1153
01:47:09,805 --> 01:47:14,640
<i>And when she does,</i>
<i>she does not go up into the sky...</i>

1154
01:47:14,743 --> 01:47:17,109
<i>but further inside of me.</i>

1155
01:48:15,470 --> 01:48:19,930
<i>If you think</i>
<i>the sky is falling</i>

1156
01:48:20,042 --> 01:48:23,136
<i>Comin' undone</i>

1157
01:48:23,245 --> 01:48:24,803
<i>Hmm</i>

1158
01:48:24,913 --> 01:48:29,373
<i>All the pieces crumble</i>

1159
01:48:29,484 --> 01:48:32,120
<i>You're on the run</i>

1160
01:48:34,356 --> 01:48:38,986
<i>All the wrong you've taken</i>

1161
01:48:39,094 --> 01:48:43,656
<i>All the rules</i>
<i>you're breakin'</i>

1162
01:48:43,765 --> 01:48:48,168
<i>Don't you know</i>
<i>the solid truth is</i>

1163
01:48:48,270 --> 01:48:50,704
<i>It comes back to you</i>

1164
01:48:50,806 --> 01:48:55,436
<i>Don't you know</i>
<i>the sky is blue</i>

1165
01:48:55,544 --> 01:49:00,174
<i>Can't you see the sun</i>
<i>is breakin' through</i>

1166
01:49:00,282 --> 01:49:04,776
<i>Have a little faith in you</i>

1167
01:49:04,886 --> 01:49:10,324
<i>Don't you know</i>
<i>the sky is blue</i>

1168
01:49:10,425 --> 01:49:11,915
<i>Huh</i>

1169
01:49:12,027 --> 01:49:16,589
<i>Every time you</i>
<i>walk out that door</i>

1170
01:49:16,698 --> 01:49:19,895
<i>Cursin' the sky</i>

1171
01:49:21,336 --> 01:49:25,966
<i>Feelin' like</i>
<i>you've been cheated</i>

1172
01:49:26,074 --> 01:49:28,406
<i>Ripped from inside</i>

1173
01:49:28,510 --> 01:49:33,106
<i>Don't you know</i>
<i>the sky is blue</i>

1174
