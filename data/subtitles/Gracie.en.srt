1
00:00:18,684 --> 00:00:21,414
#I'll sleep all day,
out all night #

2
00:00:21,453 --> 00:00:24,217
# I know where you're going #

3
00:00:24,256 --> 00:00:26,747
# I don't think
that's acting right #

4
00:00:26,792 --> 00:00:30,125
# You don't think it's showing #

5
00:00:32,197 --> 00:00:33,755
I'm hearing reservations.

6
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:35,790
Ten yards out, for you?

7
00:00:35,834 --> 00:00:37,768
Come on, man. It's like
hitting the side of a barn.

8
00:00:38,837 --> 00:00:40,464
Come on, Johnny. We're late.

9
00:00:40,939 --> 00:00:43,271
All right.
So then, let's sweeten the pot.

10
00:00:43,308 --> 00:00:45,367
We'll back it up to twenty,
and I won't be the shooter.

11
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:47,378
My sister will be.

12
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:49,811
What? Her?

13
00:00:49,848 --> 00:00:50,837
Me?

14
00:00:50,883 --> 00:00:52,043
Yeah.

15
00:00:53,619 --> 00:00:56,452
Five bucks says it's so cake,
even my sister can do it.

16
00:00:56,488 --> 00:00:57,750
There's no way I can hit that.

17
00:00:57,789 --> 00:00:58,881
She says she can't do it.

18
00:00:58,924 --> 00:00:59,913
I'll be right behind you.

19
00:00:59,958 --> 00:01:01,755
No, look.

20
00:01:01,793 --> 00:01:03,260
What's she doing?

21
00:01:03,295 --> 00:01:04,660
Flip-flops.

22
00:01:06,798 --> 00:01:07,958
Well, so, take 'em off.

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,399
#... all your plans #

24
00:01:09,434 --> 00:01:11,732
What you tryin'
to hand me?

25
00:01:14,773 --> 00:01:17,367
Five bucks. One shot.

26
00:01:17,409 --> 00:01:19,240
And the chick's
gonna shoot barefoot?

27
00:01:19,278 --> 00:01:20,575
Her name's Gracie.

28
00:01:20,612 --> 00:01:21,943
Yeah, whatever.

29
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:23,572
You're on.

30
00:01:23,615 --> 00:01:25,014
It's your money.

31
00:01:26,919 --> 00:01:28,216
Okay, see the target?

32
00:01:28,253 --> 00:01:29,379
Yeah.

33
00:01:29,421 --> 00:01:30,410
You don't want to
look at the target.

34
00:01:30,455 --> 00:01:31,683
You want to keep
your ankle locked...

35
00:01:31,723 --> 00:01:33,281
and your toes pointing down.

36
00:01:33,325 --> 00:01:34,553
- Got it.
- Right. Okay, good.

37
00:01:34,593 --> 00:01:36,288
So when you strike the ball...

38
00:01:36,328 --> 00:01:37,920
you want to make solid contact
with your instep here.

39
00:01:37,963 --> 00:01:39,396
You're gonna follow
through the target.

40
00:01:39,431 --> 00:01:41,058
All right, come on, man.
Let's go.

41
00:01:41,099 --> 00:01:43,260
Okay. Now, your plant foot...

42
00:01:43,302 --> 00:01:44,894
you want
to keep even with the ball...

43
00:01:44,937 --> 00:01:47,098
and then your kicking foot
is gonna go over the ball.

44
00:01:47,139 --> 00:01:48,265
It's too much to remember.

45
00:01:48,307 --> 00:01:49,399
Don't worry about it.

46
00:01:49,441 --> 00:01:51,466
Just wait till you're ready

47
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:53,569
You can do anything.

48
00:02:32,618 --> 00:02:33,812
Fun game. What's it called?

49
00:02:38,957 --> 00:02:42,017
#Don't look back,
a new day is breaking #

50
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,049
# It's been too long #

51
00:02:43,095 --> 00:02:44,289
Here.

52
00:02:44,329 --> 00:02:47,162
# Since I felt this way
I don't mind #

53
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:48,860
Johnny, here.

54
00:02:50,402 --> 00:02:51,926
Johnny.

55
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:54,268
# Today is the day #

56
00:02:54,306 --> 00:02:55,796
Come on, come on.

57
00:02:55,841 --> 00:02:58,309
Over here. Whoops.

58
00:03:00,345 --> 00:03:04,247
# I'm much too strong
not to compromise #

59
00:03:04,283 --> 00:03:05,910
Johnny. Here.

60
00:03:07,552 --> 00:03:09,543
Whoa.

61
00:03:11,857 --> 00:03:13,688
Barefoot?

62
00:03:13,725 --> 00:03:15,590
Never a doubt in my mind.

63
00:03:15,627 --> 00:03:17,254
You owe me a pair of flip-flops.

64
00:03:17,296 --> 00:03:18,285
Let's go.
Get back. Get back.

65
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:19,695
Shit.

66
00:03:19,731 --> 00:03:20,720
Come on. You got to move
your feet faster.

67
00:03:20,766 --> 00:03:23,792
Mike, catch up.
Cross over. Get moving.

68
00:03:23,835 --> 00:03:25,166
That's it. That's it.

69
00:03:27,406 --> 00:03:29,033
Where the hell were you?

70
00:03:29,074 --> 00:03:31,838
I took off overtime hours.
Peter and your brothers made it.

71
00:03:33,612 --> 00:03:36,945
All right, Johnny.
Let's go. Pass and shoot drill.

72
00:03:36,982 --> 00:03:38,313
I'll be the goalie.

73
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:39,749
Mike, Daniel, get in the goal.

74
00:03:39,785 --> 00:03:42,219
Hustle, hustle.

75
00:03:42,254 --> 00:03:43,983
Here you go, Peter.

76
00:03:44,022 --> 00:03:45,785
I want clean passes.
That's it.

77
00:03:45,824 --> 00:03:47,155
And shot.

78
00:03:47,192 --> 00:03:48,454
All right, Johnny, let's see it.

79
00:03:48,493 --> 00:03:50,120
And shot.
That's it. That's it.

80
00:03:50,162 --> 00:03:51,789
I could shag balls.

81
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:54,060
Peter, get it to him.

82
00:03:54,099 --> 00:03:55,623
Oh, your mom
was calling you before.

83
00:03:56,568 --> 00:03:57,762
Shoot, Johnny.

84
00:03:57,803 --> 00:04:00,294
That's it. What a shot.

85
00:04:00,339 --> 00:04:01,363
Good left foot.

86
00:04:04,476 --> 00:04:05,602
Here, honey.

87
00:04:05,644 --> 00:04:06,941
Paper says
you're gonna beat Kingston.

88
00:04:06,978 --> 00:04:08,468
They're gonna take State.
It's a done deal.

89
00:04:08,513 --> 00:04:11,107
No, no, no.
Johnny will take 'em down.

90
00:04:11,149 --> 00:04:12,639
They're animals.

91
00:04:12,684 --> 00:04:14,276
They're bigger.
They're stronger.

92
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:15,843
How's that view
from the bench?

93
00:04:15,887 --> 00:04:17,218
It's better than yours
from the stands.

94
00:04:17,255 --> 00:04:19,553
You gotta want it more, Johnny.

95
00:04:19,591 --> 00:04:20,819
Here, Dad.

96
00:04:20,859 --> 00:04:22,292
But they've got the giant.

97
00:04:22,327 --> 00:04:23,521
But he can't play soccer.

98
00:04:23,562 --> 00:04:25,189
He just knocks
everybody over. No skills.

99
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:26,390
This is our year.

100
00:04:26,431 --> 00:04:28,626
Can we talk
about something else, please?

101
00:04:28,667 --> 00:04:29,656
There is nothing else.

102
00:04:29,701 --> 00:04:30,827
Oh, really?

103
00:04:30,869 --> 00:04:33,497
We should play a 44-2 and
double-team that guy McMann?

104
00:04:33,538 --> 00:04:35,438
And you read that
on what cereal box?

105
00:04:35,474 --> 00:04:36,964
Daniel.

106
00:04:37,008 --> 00:04:39,374
Questions give the impression
one is interested.

107
00:04:39,411 --> 00:04:40,935
And you're not interested?

108
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:42,844
To what she says?

109
00:04:42,881 --> 00:04:45,076
Girls lose their brains
when their boobs grow.

110
00:04:45,117 --> 00:04:47,210
Then Grace must be really smart.

111
00:04:50,422 --> 00:04:51,684
You guys
both took four meatballs.

112
00:04:51,723 --> 00:04:53,088
Fill that for her.

113
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:55,855
We played. She didn't.

114
00:04:55,894 --> 00:04:57,589
It's not like
you eat here every night...

115
00:04:57,629 --> 00:04:59,324
just because the food's good.

116
00:04:59,364 --> 00:05:00,922
All right, fine.
It's her pick then.

117
00:05:00,966 --> 00:05:02,297
Take what you want, Grace.

118
00:05:03,602 --> 00:05:05,126
I'll take this one.

119
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:09,834
And I'll have this
for maximum boob growth.

120
00:05:11,076 --> 00:05:12,065
Elmer's hungry, huh?

121
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:13,975
That bird's never gonna fly.

122
00:05:14,012 --> 00:05:16,037
Tell him that
and he never will.

123
00:05:16,081 --> 00:05:17,514
You stretch out?

124
00:05:17,549 --> 00:05:18,538
Yeah. Yeah.

125
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:20,380
Yeah. Yeah.

126
00:05:20,419 --> 00:05:23,115
Well, don't stretch out too
fast, so you don't cramp up.

127
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,781
Is Johnny still
polishing his cleats?

128
00:05:27,993 --> 00:05:30,052
It's been almost
an hour already.

129
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:32,963
He does it for luck.

130
00:05:32,998 --> 00:05:34,625
He does it because
he's afraid to lose.

131
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:36,896
Could have
some rain tonight.

132
00:05:36,935 --> 00:05:38,596
You know what they do
in baseball, of course.

133
00:05:38,637 --> 00:05:40,070
They roll out a tarp
and everybody goes...

134
00:05:40,105 --> 00:05:41,766
to the locker room
and put their street clothes on.

135
00:05:42,974 --> 00:05:44,305
Not in soccer, you know,
you just play through...

136
00:05:44,342 --> 00:05:46,674
and in football
they just keep stopping.

137
00:05:46,711 --> 00:05:47,973
You stretch out yet?

138
00:05:48,013 --> 00:05:49,105
Yeah, Dad. Yeah.

139
00:05:49,147 --> 00:05:50,341
Well, do it again
before the game starts...

140
00:05:50,382 --> 00:05:51,508
and just do it slow.

141
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:52,539
You don't want to cramp up.

142
00:05:52,584 --> 00:05:55,519
Maybe they'll call it off.

143
00:05:58,723 --> 00:05:59,951
All right,
let's play some offense here!

144
00:06:01,927 --> 00:06:03,451
- Go! Let's go!
- To the side.

145
00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:09,066
Watch where you're goin'!

146
00:06:10,068 --> 00:06:11,057
Look for him, Johnny.

147
00:06:11,102 --> 00:06:12,399
Look for him. He's open.

148
00:06:14,005 --> 00:06:15,029
Good hustle, Johnny!

149
00:06:20,745 --> 00:06:21,734
Come on!

150
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:22,804
Let's go.

151
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:28,343
Coming your way.

152
00:06:30,155 --> 00:06:31,452
Hey.

153
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:34,085
What are you doing?
You don't even like soccer.

154
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,596
I'm here for Donny...

155
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,860
Teddy...

156
00:06:40,899 --> 00:06:42,423
and Kyle.

157
00:06:43,435 --> 00:06:45,300
All right, let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!

158
00:06:45,337 --> 00:06:47,202
Move the ball!
Move the ball!

159
00:06:48,106 --> 00:06:50,802
Move it! Move it! Move it!
Pass it to Johnny!

160
00:06:56,548 --> 00:06:58,106
There it is! There it is1

161
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:00,139
Yes!

162
00:07:00,185 --> 00:07:01,209
Yeah!

163
00:07:09,094 --> 00:07:10,823
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

164
00:07:13,298 --> 00:07:14,925
For you.

165
00:07:14,966 --> 00:07:17,833
Dude, he totally likes you.

166
00:07:17,869 --> 00:07:19,928
Why won't you go out with him?
You should.

167
00:07:22,374 --> 00:07:24,171
Never said I didn't.

168
00:07:24,209 --> 00:07:26,143
I mean, come on, the only guy
hotter is, like, your dad.

169
00:07:27,546 --> 00:07:29,173
I'm just kidding.
Your dad is old.

170
00:07:29,214 --> 00:07:30,272
Pick up your man!

171
00:07:30,882 --> 00:07:31,871
That's it!

172
00:07:31,917 --> 00:07:32,975
Yeah!

173
00:07:33,018 --> 00:07:34,679
Pick up the giant!

174
00:07:34,719 --> 00:07:36,914
Pick him up! Pick him up!

175
00:07:36,955 --> 00:07:38,479
Yeah!

176
00:07:39,057 --> 00:07:40,524
He walked in there!

177
00:07:44,563 --> 00:07:46,463
Yeah!

178
00:07:46,498 --> 00:07:47,863
That's one.

179
00:07:47,899 --> 00:07:49,491
That's it? We lost?

180
00:07:49,534 --> 00:07:52,230
No, we're going
into penalty kicks.

181
00:07:57,876 --> 00:07:59,173
Get 'em!
All right, let's go.

182
00:08:00,679 --> 00:08:02,044
All right, all right,
all right.

183
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:22,957
Yes!

184
00:08:23,001 --> 00:08:25,401
Chuck! Chuck!

185
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:29,630
Kingston! Kingston!

186
00:08:29,674 --> 00:08:31,869
Kingston! Kingston!

187
00:08:36,047 --> 00:08:37,571
Yeah!

188
00:08:37,616 --> 00:08:38,981
Did Kingston win?

189
00:08:39,017 --> 00:08:40,245
No.
They have the go-ahead goal.

190
00:08:40,285 --> 00:08:41,980
If we don't score, we lose.

191
00:08:43,955 --> 00:08:46,583
Let's go. Let's go.

192
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:48,252
Come on, now.
Shoot 'em dead, Johnny.

193
00:09:04,275 --> 00:09:05,606
Miss it!

194
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:33,403
Come on, Johnny!

195
00:09:34,706 --> 00:09:37,266
Wait till you're ready.

196
00:09:37,308 --> 00:09:38,741
- You can do anything.
- You can do anything.

197
00:09:54,225 --> 00:09:56,386
Kingston! Kingston!

198
00:09:56,428 --> 00:09:59,295
Kingston! Kingston!
Kingston!

199
00:10:22,921 --> 00:10:24,513
Hey, is he in there?

200
00:10:24,556 --> 00:10:25,580
Last one.

201
00:10:36,367 --> 00:10:37,629
Hey.

202
00:10:41,906 --> 00:10:45,069
You scored a great goal.

203
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:47,169
Did Dad send you?

204
00:10:47,212 --> 00:10:48,338
No.

205
00:10:50,348 --> 00:10:52,543
You're not supposed
to be in here.

206
00:10:52,584 --> 00:10:54,017
Your team's waiting.

207
00:10:58,456 --> 00:11:00,947
It was supposed to go in.

208
00:11:00,992 --> 00:11:03,187
I put it right there.

209
00:11:03,228 --> 00:11:04,559
I blew it.

210
00:11:13,872 --> 00:11:15,601
"You know what, son?

211
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,609
"You win as a team
and you lose as a team."

212
00:11:18,643 --> 00:11:20,770
Yeah, screw Dad.

213
00:11:23,214 --> 00:11:24,704
You know what? You're right.

214
00:11:24,749 --> 00:11:26,580
You really sucked out there.

215
00:11:29,354 --> 00:11:31,515
Yeah, I did. Big time.

216
00:11:36,194 --> 00:11:37,218
Come on. Let's go.

217
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:53,938
Love you.

218
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,104
Come on, Johnny.
Let's roll.

219
00:12:22,473 --> 00:12:25,067
A drunk driver.
He was pulled from the car.

220
00:12:25,109 --> 00:12:27,168
The other boys are banged up.

221
00:12:27,212 --> 00:12:30,181
Where's Johnny?
Which hospital is he in?

222
00:12:31,449 --> 00:12:32,916
Lindsay, Johnny didn't make it.

223
00:12:32,951 --> 00:12:34,350
I'm gonna get my purse.

224
00:12:34,385 --> 00:12:35,477
Lindsay, Johnny didn't make it.

225
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,420
No!

226
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:40,655
Oh, no!

227
00:12:44,395 --> 00:12:47,330
No! No!

228
00:14:19,457 --> 00:14:20,583
Aah!

229
00:14:33,972 --> 00:14:36,440
What color was the car?

230
00:14:36,474 --> 00:14:39,238
It's the Walker's car.
It's maroon.

231
00:14:39,277 --> 00:14:40,403
How fast was it going?

232
00:14:40,445 --> 00:14:41,434
I don't know.

233
00:14:41,479 --> 00:14:43,071
What if somebody
asks something?

234
00:14:43,114 --> 00:14:44,581
Tell them the truth,
that he died in a car accident.

235
00:14:44,615 --> 00:14:46,014
What if they want details?

236
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:47,745
There are no details.

237
00:14:47,785 --> 00:14:50,754
He died instantly.
He didn't see it coming.

238
00:14:50,788 --> 00:14:51,880
And dying doesn't hurt.

239
00:14:51,923 --> 00:14:52,947
Was there lots of blood?

240
00:14:52,991 --> 00:14:55,755
No. No more questions, okay?

241
00:14:56,661 --> 00:14:58,356
Hey, Peter, come on in.

242
00:14:58,963 --> 00:15:00,931
Still giving rides to school?

243
00:15:00,965 --> 00:15:02,660
Do we have to go?

244
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:05,066
Yes. Everybody goes today...

245
00:15:06,704 --> 00:15:08,296
and tonight.

246
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:10,534
You're taking
your grandpa, okay?

247
00:15:10,575 --> 00:15:12,475
Here, Dad.

248
00:15:14,545 --> 00:15:17,708
The most improved
junior varsity player...

249
00:15:17,749 --> 00:15:20,912
a player who surprised us all
this year with 15 assists...

250
00:15:20,952 --> 00:15:22,249
Neil Nielson.

251
00:15:22,286 --> 00:15:23,685
Come on up here, Neil.

252
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:27,082
Congratulations.

253
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:28,422
Thanks, Mr. C.

254
00:15:28,459 --> 00:15:29,653
We're all proud of you, son.

255
00:15:35,066 --> 00:15:36,624
I couldn't let
this evening pass...

256
00:15:36,667 --> 00:15:39,431
without saying a few words
about a boy who is not here.

257
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:40,459
A boy who was not only...

258
00:15:40,505 --> 00:15:42,268
an extraordinarily
gifted athlete...

259
00:15:42,306 --> 00:15:46,072
but also the best
all-around human being...

260
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:48,305
I've ever had
the honor of coaching.

261
00:15:48,346 --> 00:15:50,871
Bryan, would you like to come
up here and say a few words?

262
00:15:55,686 --> 00:15:56,812
Thanks.

263
00:15:59,257 --> 00:16:00,815
Um, thanks, Coach.

264
00:16:00,858 --> 00:16:03,418
Um, Johnny
really loved you guys...

265
00:16:03,461 --> 00:16:05,656
and he loved this game.

266
00:16:05,696 --> 00:16:07,129
He loved this place.

267
00:16:08,766 --> 00:16:10,859
More than anything...

268
00:16:10,902 --> 00:16:14,133
he wanted to beat Kingston
and make our town proud.

269
00:16:15,106 --> 00:16:16,630
Never saw that win.

270
00:16:20,445 --> 00:16:22,242
But don't be sad for him.

271
00:16:27,085 --> 00:16:28,245
You know what? Just go out
there next season...

272
00:16:28,286 --> 00:16:30,345
and beat those bastards,
all right?

273
00:16:32,557 --> 00:16:34,320
You can still do it.
It's what he wanted.

274
00:16:37,395 --> 00:16:40,592
You can make it happen...
for Johnny.

275
00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:49,717
I have an announcement.

276
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,250
She got her period.

277
00:18:52,396 --> 00:18:54,489
I know how to beat Kingston
next season.

278
00:18:54,532 --> 00:18:56,523
I'm gonna play
in Johnny's place.

279
00:18:56,567 --> 00:18:57,727
Dad's gonna train me.

280
00:18:57,768 --> 00:18:59,793
We have nine months
before tryouts.

281
00:19:12,149 --> 00:19:14,515
You had to laugh?

282
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,387
Grace, sweetie, I'm sorry.

283
00:19:17,421 --> 00:19:18,410
You wouldn't have laughed
if it was Mike or Danny.

284
00:19:18,456 --> 00:19:20,390
Well, they're boys.

285
00:19:20,424 --> 00:19:21,550
You said at the banquet...

286
00:19:21,592 --> 00:19:22,889
you said, "Go out there
and beat Kingston."

287
00:19:22,927 --> 00:19:24,189
I didn't mean you.

288
00:19:27,698 --> 00:19:29,632
Watch this. Top corner.

289
00:19:30,635 --> 00:19:32,603
Good, but not good enough.

290
00:19:32,637 --> 00:19:33,899
What are you talking about?

291
00:19:33,938 --> 00:19:35,462
That was right
in the upper corner.

292
00:19:35,506 --> 00:19:36,803
There's no goalie.
Nobody blocking you.

293
00:19:36,841 --> 00:19:38,035
There's nothing on it.

294
00:19:38,075 --> 00:19:39,064
I drilled it.

295
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:41,840
It was a terrible shot.
You hit the post.

296
00:19:41,879 --> 00:19:42,868
That's crap.

297
00:19:42,913 --> 00:19:43,902
It was a meatball.

298
00:19:43,948 --> 00:19:44,937
My grandmother could have
knocked it down...

299
00:19:44,982 --> 00:19:46,108
with her handbag.

300
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:49,779
Peter. Peter, get out here.
You're playin'.

301
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,720
Come on. I want you
one-on-one to the goal.

302
00:19:51,756 --> 00:19:52,780
You want to play soccer?

303
00:19:52,823 --> 00:19:54,085
Don't go easy on me.

304
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:55,683
There's the ball. Play ball.

305
00:19:55,726 --> 00:19:57,751
Wide right.

306
00:19:57,795 --> 00:20:01,060
Again. Right now. Play ball.

307
00:20:02,033 --> 00:20:04,433
Get around him.

308
00:20:04,468 --> 00:20:05,457
Oh.

309
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,697
Bryan, that's enough.

310
00:20:06,737 --> 00:20:07,931
Again.

311
00:20:07,972 --> 00:20:08,961
You're gonna do it.

312
00:20:09,006 --> 00:20:10,906
Come on. Show me.

313
00:20:16,347 --> 00:20:17,678
Bryan, I said that's enough!

314
00:20:17,715 --> 00:20:18,704
Get out of here!

315
00:20:18,749 --> 00:20:20,876
Peter, get dry.
Get in the house.

316
00:20:20,918 --> 00:20:22,579
I'm calling it, Grace.

317
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,019
Dad, I can do this!

318
00:20:24,055 --> 00:20:25,716
- No. No, you can't.
- Yes, I can!

319
00:20:25,756 --> 00:20:28,020
You can't even beat him, and
he's not on the starting team!

320
00:20:28,059 --> 00:20:29,083
Yes, I can!

321
00:20:29,126 --> 00:20:31,026
It's this simple.
You're not tough enough.

322
00:20:31,062 --> 00:20:32,086
They're gonna cream you.

323
00:20:32,963 --> 00:20:34,123
It's not gonna happen.

324
00:20:38,736 --> 00:20:42,866
Grace. Grace, sweetheart.

325
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:46,836
- Stop. Stop.

326
00:20:46,877 --> 00:20:47,969
- No.
- Stop it.

327
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:53,939
Daddy.

328
00:20:53,984 --> 00:20:56,646
Dad, please help me.

329
00:21:00,424 --> 00:21:01,618
No.

330
00:21:21,912 --> 00:21:23,709
Not everything's possible.

331
00:21:25,082 --> 00:21:26,743
It was for Johnny.

332
00:21:28,652 --> 00:21:30,051
It's different for you
because you're a girl.

333
00:21:30,087 --> 00:21:31,987
It's just a lot harder.

334
00:21:33,591 --> 00:21:35,991
You know, my mom used to say
that for us girls...

335
00:21:36,026 --> 00:21:39,757
life is one big shit sandwich,
and we all got to take a bite.

336
00:21:42,867 --> 00:21:44,994
Is that what you did?

337
00:22:49,633 --> 00:22:51,328
It was a series
of personal hardships...

338
00:22:51,368 --> 00:22:52,357
and political defeats...

339
00:22:52,403 --> 00:22:54,268
that gave him
the moral courage to stand up...

340
00:22:54,305 --> 00:22:55,567
and face
these presidential races.

341
00:22:55,606 --> 00:22:57,130
Hey, you know, I want
those outlines tomorrow.

342
00:22:57,174 --> 00:22:58,471
I have some exams here.

343
00:22:58,509 --> 00:23:01,000
Himmelman, Sanchez...

344
00:23:01,045 --> 00:23:02,672
Gracie, can I see you a sec?

345
00:23:04,315 --> 00:23:08,684
Your exam was totally blank.
Should I fail you?

346
00:23:08,719 --> 00:23:11,882
Gracie, you're gonna have
to step up for the next one. L...

347
00:23:11,922 --> 00:23:13,583
I can overlook this one.

348
00:23:13,624 --> 00:23:15,216
I gotta get going.

349
00:23:15,259 --> 00:23:18,422
Do you want to talk
to somebody? The nurse?

350
00:23:19,663 --> 00:23:22,393
My mother is the nurse.

351
00:23:22,433 --> 00:23:23,866
Gracie, like this.

352
00:23:23,901 --> 00:23:28,998
# Don't leave me hanging
on the telephone #

353
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,939
This way, the smoke
won't burn your eyes.

354
00:23:30,975 --> 00:23:32,374
Kyle's gonna be captain
next year.

355
00:23:32,409 --> 00:23:33,933
He tell you?

356
00:23:33,978 --> 00:23:37,072
Yeah, he told me when I told
him I'd be his girlfriend.

357
00:23:37,114 --> 00:23:38,809
Kyle?

358
00:23:38,849 --> 00:23:42,945
He's gonna have expectations.

359
00:23:42,987 --> 00:23:44,921
I know.

360
00:23:44,955 --> 00:23:47,423
I can't miss Bio again.

361
00:23:48,592 --> 00:23:50,423
I can.

362
00:23:50,461 --> 00:23:53,953
# I like to talk when I can
show you my affection #

363
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:57,590
So who gets the room?

364
00:23:59,803 --> 00:24:01,896
Daniel, Mike.

365
00:24:03,807 --> 00:24:05,240
It's mine!

366
00:24:05,276 --> 00:24:07,608
No, it's mine! I'm older!

367
00:24:07,645 --> 00:24:08,669
I'm smarter.

368
00:24:08,712 --> 00:24:09,974
Yeah, right, dumbo.

369
00:24:10,014 --> 00:24:12,039
You're dumbo, too.

370
00:24:12,082 --> 00:24:15,984
You're the most dumbo.

371
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:18,284
I knew if I asked you,
you'd say no.

372
00:24:24,795 --> 00:24:26,888
From Hollywood...

373
00:24:33,737 --> 00:24:37,730
- inviting you to join Johnny
and his guests George Carlin...

374
00:24:37,775 --> 00:24:40,767
Lola Falana,
Charles Grant, and...

375
00:25:04,735 --> 00:25:07,704
Grace just got
into Kyle Rhodes' car.

376
00:25:07,738 --> 00:25:08,932
What?

377
00:25:14,845 --> 00:25:18,542
I said that Grace just
drove off in Kyle Rhodes' car.

378
00:25:20,184 --> 00:25:21,674
I can't do it.

379
00:25:21,719 --> 00:25:22,811
I can't do it
all by myself, Bryan.

380
00:25:22,853 --> 00:25:24,013
I need your help.

381
00:25:24,054 --> 00:25:25,544
I'm not asking you to.

382
00:25:25,589 --> 00:25:29,218
Yes, you are. You're asking
me to do it all alone.

383
00:25:29,259 --> 00:25:30,556
What do you want me to do?

384
00:25:31,629 --> 00:25:33,529
I don't know. I don't know.

385
00:25:33,564 --> 00:25:34,690
But we're here.
We're still here.

386
00:25:34,732 --> 00:25:36,996
You've got three children
who are still here.

387
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:00,321
# Born under the wrong sign #

388
00:26:01,525 --> 00:26:02,685
# Trouble is my middle name #

389
00:26:02,726 --> 00:26:04,626
Wow.

390
00:26:04,662 --> 00:26:07,426
Your skin is so soft.

391
00:26:09,533 --> 00:26:12,297
So, uh, do you have
these freckle things everywhere?

392
00:26:15,606 --> 00:26:18,006
Where are you going?

393
00:26:22,813 --> 00:26:25,077
Gracie.
Gracie, what are you doing?

394
00:26:30,454 --> 00:26:31,887
What are you, crazy?

395
00:26:31,922 --> 00:26:33,913
Gracie, what are you doing?

396
00:26:37,961 --> 00:26:39,929
Your g's backwards.

397
00:26:39,963 --> 00:26:41,760
It's a "j."

398
00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:43,266
Who for?

399
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,063
Johnny.

400
00:26:45,102 --> 00:26:48,765
Ah. Yeah,
that's... That's really...

401
00:26:48,806 --> 00:26:50,239
That's really sweet.

402
00:26:52,943 --> 00:26:55,070
Car. Gracie.

403
00:27:07,991 --> 00:27:13,395
Kyle, do you really like me?

404
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:16,593
Yeah, yeah.

405
00:27:16,633 --> 00:27:18,260
I really do.

406
00:27:19,436 --> 00:27:21,666
You think a girl
could ever play soccer?

407
00:27:22,606 --> 00:27:25,166
That's a good one.

408
00:27:25,209 --> 00:27:26,938
Gracie.

409
00:27:28,178 --> 00:27:30,578
What is up with you?

410
00:27:34,852 --> 00:27:36,251
...White House window box.

411
00:28:04,148 --> 00:28:06,139
I am tough enough.

412
00:28:13,056 --> 00:28:16,856
WPLJ music specials feature
on Saturday night at ten...

413
00:28:16,894 --> 00:28:19,124
oh, my,
Paul McCartney and Wings...

414
00:28:19,163 --> 00:28:21,290
Sunday night at ten,
the Rolling Stones.

415
00:28:21,331 --> 00:28:23,299
There you go.
I'm Carroll Miller.

416
00:28:23,333 --> 00:28:24,664
It's always great music
for you right here...

417
00:28:24,701 --> 00:28:29,138
with Bruce Springsteen on WPLJ,
New York's top album station.

418
00:28:29,173 --> 00:28:33,075
# Well, I stood stone-like
at midnight #

419
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:36,546
# Suspended in my masquerade #

420
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:40,141
# And I combed my hair
till it was just right #

421
00:28:40,184 --> 00:28:43,813
# And commanded
the night brigade

422
00:28:43,854 --> 00:28:47,915
# I was open to pain
and crossed by the rain #

423
00:28:47,958 --> 00:28:50,859
# And I walked
on a crooked crutch #

424
00:28:50,894 --> 00:28:55,092
# I strolled all alone
through a fallout zone #

425
00:28:55,132 --> 00:28:58,590
# And came out
with my soul untouched #

426
00:28:58,635 --> 00:29:02,036
# I hid in the clouded wrath
of the crowd #

427
00:29:02,072 --> 00:29:04,336
# When they said, "Sit down,"
I stood up #

428
00:29:04,374 --> 00:29:06,342
Hey, Gracie.

429
00:29:06,376 --> 00:29:07,968
# Ooh-ooh #

430
00:29:08,011 --> 00:29:09,911
I'm not gonna wait forever.

431
00:29:09,947 --> 00:29:14,281
# Growin' up #

432
00:29:14,318 --> 00:29:15,342
When?

433
00:29:16,887 --> 00:29:20,118
# And the flag of piracy
flew from my mast #

434
00:29:20,157 --> 00:29:23,854
# My sails were set
wing to wing #

435
00:29:23,894 --> 00:29:27,796
# I had a jukebox graduate
for first mate #

436
00:29:27,831 --> 00:29:31,460
# She couldn't sail,
but she sure could sing #

437
00:29:31,501 --> 00:29:34,868
# And I pushed B-52
and bombed 'em with the blues #

438
00:29:34,905 --> 00:29:38,602
# With my gear set stubborn
on standing #

439
00:29:38,642 --> 00:29:42,237
# I broke all the rules,
strafed my old high school #

440
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:45,578
# Never once
gave thought to landing #

441
00:29:45,616 --> 00:29:48,449
The weight room
doesn't open till eight.

442
00:29:48,485 --> 00:29:51,113
It's for boys only.

443
00:29:51,154 --> 00:29:54,954
Are these written policies
or just common practice?

444
00:29:57,861 --> 00:29:59,852
The girls' gym
doesn't have any weights.

445
00:29:59,897 --> 00:30:02,161
I can be here early
and nobody would even know.

446
00:30:02,199 --> 00:30:03,257
I'd know.

447
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,995
Is that such a burden?

448
00:30:05,035 --> 00:30:07,367
I can't break rules for you.

449
00:30:09,306 --> 00:30:10,637
Fine.

450
00:30:10,674 --> 00:30:13,609
# But my feet they finally
took root in the earth #

451
00:30:13,644 --> 00:30:17,580
# But I got me a nice
little place in the stars #

452
00:30:17,614 --> 00:30:21,744
# And I swear I found the key
to the universe #

453
00:30:21,785 --> 00:30:25,186
# In the engine
of an old parked car #

454
00:30:25,222 --> 00:30:28,658
# I hid in the mother breast
of the crowd #

455
00:30:28,692 --> 00:30:32,992
# When they said, "Pull down,"
I pulled up #

456
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:36,557
# Ooh-ooh #

457
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:40,058
# Growin' up #

458
00:30:40,103 --> 00:30:43,834
# Ooh-ooh #

459
00:30:43,874 --> 00:30:47,605
# Growin' up #

460
00:30:47,644 --> 00:30:49,544
- Hey.
- Hey, yourself.

461
00:30:49,579 --> 00:30:52,173
I so dig this music,
don't you?

462
00:30:55,252 --> 00:30:56,776
I'm burning
to ask you something.

463
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:59,118
- What's that?
- Don't you ever get a break?

464
00:30:59,156 --> 00:31:02,023
Working the door.

465
00:31:02,059 --> 00:31:03,856
'Cause if you did...

466
00:31:03,894 --> 00:31:06,556
I was thinking
that maybe we could dance.

467
00:31:08,098 --> 00:31:10,123
You got an I.D?

468
00:31:10,167 --> 00:31:11,361
No.

469
00:31:12,536 --> 00:31:15,061
Go on.

470
00:31:15,105 --> 00:31:18,563
# Baby, baby,
let's get together #

471
00:31:18,608 --> 00:31:19,836
# Party hearty #

472
00:31:19,876 --> 00:31:21,741
Where did you
learn to do that?

473
00:31:21,778 --> 00:31:23,746
From you.

474
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:25,907
Kyle's here.
You didn't tell me.

475
00:31:25,949 --> 00:31:27,507
I didn't know.

476
00:31:27,551 --> 00:31:28,916
Liar.

477
00:31:28,952 --> 00:31:31,011
# That we like to do #

478
00:31:31,054 --> 00:31:34,023
# Aw, do a little dance #

479
00:31:34,057 --> 00:31:37,788
# Make a little love,
get down tonight #

480
00:31:37,828 --> 00:31:40,991
Hey, you showed.

481
00:31:41,031 --> 00:31:44,694
# Do a little dance,
make a little love #

482
00:31:44,735 --> 00:31:46,760
# Get down tonight #

483
00:31:46,803 --> 00:31:48,771
# Get down tonight, baby #

484
00:32:08,025 --> 00:32:10,459
So are we gonna do this?

485
00:32:24,841 --> 00:32:26,638
Let's do this.

486
00:32:31,014 --> 00:32:33,312
Just relax.

487
00:32:34,184 --> 00:32:35,776
Stop.

488
00:32:35,819 --> 00:32:38,049
Hey, you're the one
who brought me out here.

489
00:32:38,088 --> 00:32:39,715
I mean,
look what you're wearing.

490
00:32:42,993 --> 00:32:44,290
Stop.

491
00:32:48,265 --> 00:32:51,598
Hey. I told you
a Bowen can't go all the way.

492
00:32:54,471 --> 00:32:56,200
You're way out
of your league, sweetheart.

493
00:32:57,274 --> 00:32:59,742
You owe me 20 bucks, Curt.

494
00:32:59,776 --> 00:33:02,210
Yeah, whatever.

495
00:33:04,681 --> 00:33:06,546
Oh, my God.

496
00:33:15,559 --> 00:33:17,686
Bryan.

497
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:23,299
Did anyone tell you
why we're here?

498
00:33:24,534 --> 00:33:26,468
Mr. Bowen? Lindsay.

499
00:33:26,503 --> 00:33:29,995
Your daughter Grace,
on her last History exam...

500
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,804
copied word for word
from Jena Walpen's paper.

501
00:33:32,843 --> 00:33:34,868
I hated to do it,
but I had to fail her.

502
00:33:34,911 --> 00:33:36,879
Both girls are on probation.

503
00:33:40,584 --> 00:33:42,313
Goal! Goal!

504
00:33:42,352 --> 00:33:44,877
Why is Peter here?

505
00:33:44,921 --> 00:33:47,822
I think the boys wanted
someone to practice with.

506
00:33:47,858 --> 00:33:51,191
Oh, yeah!
Yes! Oh! Yes!

507
00:33:51,228 --> 00:33:54,197
Would you like to go
with me on Saturday?

508
00:33:54,231 --> 00:33:55,255
I thought
we could get you a trim...

509
00:33:55,298 --> 00:33:56,492
get the hair off your face.

510
00:33:56,533 --> 00:33:58,057
I like my hair.

511
00:33:59,536 --> 00:34:02,130
But, honey,
nobody can see you.

512
00:34:02,172 --> 00:34:04,402
We could go to the mall
and get you some new tops.

513
00:34:04,441 --> 00:34:06,466
I don't like the clothes
they have there.

514
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:08,341
Okay. Anything you want.
You choose.

515
00:34:08,378 --> 00:34:11,313
Honey, what is going on?

516
00:34:11,348 --> 00:34:13,009
I'm just busy.

517
00:34:13,049 --> 00:34:16,610
Well, with what?
A boy? Kyle?

518
00:34:16,653 --> 00:34:17,915
Just things, you know.

519
00:34:17,954 --> 00:34:20,047
I don't know.
That's why I'm asking.

520
00:34:20,924 --> 00:34:24,121
We saw
Principal Enright today.

521
00:34:24,161 --> 00:34:26,721
Grace, you flunked History.

522
00:34:26,763 --> 00:34:28,230
So what, I'm grounded?

523
00:34:28,265 --> 00:34:30,460
Uh, sh... well...
Uh, I didn't say that.

524
00:34:34,004 --> 00:34:36,097
Well, not yet anyway.

525
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:38,039
Well, let me know when
you decide on something.

526
00:34:48,552 --> 00:34:50,019
What's going on?

527
00:34:51,188 --> 00:34:52,712
Do I have to check
your homework every night?

528
00:34:52,756 --> 00:34:54,348
Good boy.

529
00:34:54,391 --> 00:34:56,825
If you're gonna act like a kid,
that's how I'll treat you.

530
00:35:00,197 --> 00:35:01,664
Show me your homework.

531
00:35:01,698 --> 00:35:03,723
- Didn't do it.
- Do it now.

532
00:35:03,767 --> 00:35:05,632
Can't.
Didn't bring my books home.

533
00:35:11,408 --> 00:35:13,774
You're grounded.
Come straight home from school.

534
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:15,641
And if your grades
don't come up, summer school.

535
00:35:19,749 --> 00:35:21,614
I want to do something
I've never done before.

536
00:35:21,651 --> 00:35:22,640
Really?

537
00:35:22,686 --> 00:35:24,517
Something you've
never done before.

538
00:35:24,554 --> 00:35:25,987
I can think of a few things.

539
00:35:26,022 --> 00:35:28,081
I want to do 'em all at once,
right now.

540
00:35:31,261 --> 00:35:32,523
Come on. Go.

541
00:35:32,562 --> 00:35:33,995
Come on.

542
00:35:35,498 --> 00:35:36,931
You got a license?

543
00:35:36,967 --> 00:35:38,662
Yeah.
Right here. My mom's.

544
00:35:38,702 --> 00:35:40,727
Let's go. Come on.

545
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:42,362
Shh! Shh!

546
00:35:42,405 --> 00:35:43,838
Right here. Come on.

547
00:35:45,442 --> 00:35:47,876
Bye, boys.

548
00:35:52,616 --> 00:35:57,110
# I don't want
to know your name #

549
00:35:58,455 --> 00:36:01,891
# 'Cause you don't
look the same #

550
00:36:01,925 --> 00:36:07,659
# The way you did before #

551
00:36:07,697 --> 00:36:09,995
# Fox on the run #

552
00:36:10,033 --> 00:36:11,261
# You scream #

553
00:36:11,301 --> 00:36:15,362
# And everybody comes
a-running #

554
00:36:15,405 --> 00:36:20,342
# Take a run
and hide yourself away #

555
00:36:51,174 --> 00:36:53,165
Enough sun.
Let's go to the club.

556
00:36:54,311 --> 00:36:58,304
# Once I had a love,
and it was a gas #

557
00:36:58,348 --> 00:36:59,815
# Soon turned out #

558
00:36:59,849 --> 00:37:01,373
What college you go to?

559
00:37:01,418 --> 00:37:02,851
Up in Boston.

560
00:37:02,886 --> 00:37:04,114
Oh, cool. Which one?

561
00:37:05,722 --> 00:37:08,384
I want to go dance.
You want to come dance with me?

562
00:37:12,696 --> 00:37:15,494
All right.

563
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,697
# Once I had a love,
and it was divine #

564
00:37:20,737 --> 00:37:23,001
He majors in astrology
so he can read girls' hands.

565
00:37:23,039 --> 00:37:25,337
Like, you know, like...

566
00:37:25,375 --> 00:37:27,809
# Seemed like the real thing,
but I was so blind #

567
00:37:27,844 --> 00:37:29,402
Like this is
your love line.

568
00:37:29,446 --> 00:37:31,778
It goes all the way up and...

569
00:37:31,815 --> 00:37:33,942
I'll be right back.

570
00:37:33,983 --> 00:37:36,543
Okay.

571
00:37:36,586 --> 00:37:40,044
# In between
what I find is pleasing #

572
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:42,456
# And I'm feeling fine #

573
00:37:42,492 --> 00:37:44,084
# Love is so confusing #

574
00:37:44,127 --> 00:37:48,587
# There's no peace of mind
if I fear I'm losing you #

575
00:37:48,631 --> 00:37:52,624
# It's just no good
you teasing like you do #

576
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:56,104
# Ooh-ooh, oh-oh #

577
00:37:57,374 --> 00:38:00,434
# Ooh-ooh, oh-oh #

578
00:38:02,912 --> 00:38:04,174
So you're from Beantown?

579
00:38:04,214 --> 00:38:06,079
Yeah. Yeah.

580
00:38:06,116 --> 00:38:08,482
I've been there a lot actually.
I go to college there.

581
00:38:08,518 --> 00:38:10,247
Oh, yeah? Which one?

582
00:38:10,286 --> 00:38:12,720
BBC.

583
00:38:14,257 --> 00:38:15,781
BBC?

584
00:38:15,825 --> 00:38:16,917
Mm-hmm.

585
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,621
Yeah. How old are you?

586
00:38:18,661 --> 00:38:19,787
I'm old enough.

587
00:38:21,264 --> 00:38:23,232
Yeah. I don't... I don't
think this is a good idea.

588
00:38:23,266 --> 00:38:24,324
Let's go back.

589
00:38:25,835 --> 00:38:28,099
No. Come on.

590
00:38:29,873 --> 00:38:31,204
I have a car.

591
00:38:32,275 --> 00:38:35,574
# Ooh-hoo, Jackie Blue #

592
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:40,416
# Making wishes
that never come true #

593
00:38:41,684 --> 00:38:44,915
# Going places
where you've never been #

594
00:38:46,122 --> 00:38:49,455
# Ooh, Jackie,
you're going again #

595
00:38:52,395 --> 00:38:55,023
Come on, baby.

596
00:38:55,064 --> 00:38:57,294
- What was that?
- Nothing.

597
00:39:00,603 --> 00:39:03,197
Gracie. Gracie.

598
00:39:03,239 --> 00:39:05,036
- Oh, shit.
- Gracie, get out of the car.

599
00:39:05,074 --> 00:39:06,063
Who's that?

600
00:39:06,109 --> 00:39:07,269
Out, out. Get out.

601
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:08,641
Where's my shirt?

602
00:39:08,678 --> 00:39:09,770
Come on, punk.
Get packing.

603
00:39:14,083 --> 00:39:17,018
Gracie, come on out.
Right now.

604
00:39:19,022 --> 00:39:20,512
Gracie, you all right?

605
00:39:20,557 --> 00:39:22,149
Oh, yeah. She's fine.

606
00:39:22,192 --> 00:39:23,420
I owe you one, Sal.

607
00:39:25,795 --> 00:39:27,160
You can stop
acting like you care.

608
00:39:27,197 --> 00:39:28,892
Nobody can see you.

609
00:39:28,932 --> 00:39:31,332
You're just lucky
you didn't get hurt.

610
00:39:31,367 --> 00:39:33,392
Gracie, what the hell
were you thinking?

611
00:39:33,436 --> 00:39:35,529
Do you really want to have
this conversation?

612
00:39:36,706 --> 00:39:38,196
I do.

613
00:39:38,241 --> 00:39:40,505
Then talk.

614
00:39:53,323 --> 00:39:54,984
Come on, Dad.

615
00:40:39,402 --> 00:40:40,960
Gracie, get up. Come on.
Get dressed.

616
00:40:43,006 --> 00:40:45,372
Two feet on the floor.
Let's go.

617
00:40:46,776 --> 00:40:47,834
Dad.

618
00:40:49,812 --> 00:40:51,439
Don't make me get the ice water.

619
00:40:51,481 --> 00:40:52,505
Go away.

620
00:40:52,549 --> 00:40:55,279
You want to talk?
This is me talking.

621
00:41:02,825 --> 00:41:05,225
I can't do anything
about the weight room.

622
00:41:05,261 --> 00:41:07,525
Grace wants to play
varsity soccer.

623
00:41:07,564 --> 00:41:09,327
That's terrific.

624
00:41:09,365 --> 00:41:12,198
Really great, but Columbia
doesn't have a girls' team.

625
00:41:12,235 --> 00:41:13,827
That's why she's trying out
for the boys' team.

626
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:15,963
- No, I'm not.
- Grace.

627
00:41:16,005 --> 00:41:17,666
You can't play a girl
on a boys' team.

628
00:41:17,707 --> 00:41:18,867
There's no law against it.

629
00:41:18,908 --> 00:41:21,968
There's no law for it.
She could get injured.

630
00:41:22,011 --> 00:41:23,171
So what?

631
00:41:23,212 --> 00:41:24,440
Look.

632
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,846
I'm not risking the success
of my team for one girl.

633
00:41:26,883 --> 00:41:28,646
I've got the team this year
to win the whole thing.

634
00:41:28,685 --> 00:41:30,983
Well, maybe she can
help you do it.

635
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:32,578
Have you seen her play?

636
00:41:32,622 --> 00:41:34,249
Coach, we're not asking
for any special treatment.

637
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:36,781
Just a tryout. She can
either do it or she can't.

638
00:41:36,826 --> 00:41:40,694
It's not my call. Take it up
with the school board.

639
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:41,719
What the hell was that?

640
00:41:41,764 --> 00:41:43,595
You wanted to play,
let's petition the board.

641
00:41:43,633 --> 00:41:44,657
Like you care.

642
00:41:44,701 --> 00:41:45,690
You take summer school
in the morning...

643
00:41:45,735 --> 00:41:46,861
train with me
in the afternoon.

644
00:41:46,903 --> 00:41:48,268
Tryouts are in two months,
you know.

645
00:41:48,304 --> 00:41:50,795
Why now?

646
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,307
Where were you
when I was begging you?

647
00:41:52,342 --> 00:41:54,708
Where have you been
my entire freakin' life?

648
00:41:54,744 --> 00:41:56,336
Everything's always been
about Johnny, about your boys.

649
00:41:56,379 --> 00:41:59,507
You don't even care about me
because I'm not one of 'em.

650
00:41:59,549 --> 00:42:01,642
- Oh, come on, Gracie.
- Shut up!

651
00:42:01,684 --> 00:42:03,311
Hey, you can't talk
to me like that.

652
00:42:03,353 --> 00:42:04,684
Listen, you think anybody
got better on their own?

653
00:42:04,721 --> 00:42:06,018
I coached Johnny.

654
00:42:06,055 --> 00:42:07,317
Johnny was a natural.

655
00:42:07,357 --> 00:42:08,585
Johnny was a boy!

656
00:42:15,431 --> 00:42:17,763
You know, I never had
anybody care about me.

657
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:21,361
Nobody ever gave me
their damn time.

658
00:42:21,404 --> 00:42:23,895
My knee's killing me.

659
00:42:31,414 --> 00:42:34,975
Grace, I don't know if
you are good enough, but...

660
00:42:36,919 --> 00:42:39,217
let me help you.

661
00:43:31,307 --> 00:43:33,434
Here.
The school board letter.

662
00:43:34,711 --> 00:43:35,735
You write this?

663
00:43:35,778 --> 00:43:36,938
Yeah. You sign it, too.

664
00:43:38,314 --> 00:43:40,942
The sooner we mail it,
the sooner they say yes.

665
00:43:42,385 --> 00:43:43,909
Those boys are gonna
try and take you out.

666
00:43:43,953 --> 00:43:45,750
They're gonna go after you.

667
00:43:45,788 --> 00:43:48,552
So I'll teach you how to
take it, how to give it back.

668
00:43:48,591 --> 00:43:50,252
It's mental
as much as it is physical.

669
00:43:51,461 --> 00:43:54,453
First, we work on speed,
toughness...

670
00:43:54,497 --> 00:43:56,522
then we work with the ball.

671
00:43:56,566 --> 00:43:58,056
You want to do this?

672
00:43:59,936 --> 00:44:01,927
Let's go.

673
00:44:03,906 --> 00:44:06,136
- Tired?
- No.

674
00:44:06,175 --> 00:44:07,540
'Cause if you want
to take a break.

675
00:44:07,577 --> 00:44:09,067
- No. You?
- You seem a little sluggish.

676
00:44:09,112 --> 00:44:11,444
I'm just taking it easy on you.

677
00:44:13,416 --> 00:44:15,714
Gracie.

678
00:44:19,922 --> 00:44:21,822
Dad.

679
00:44:31,501 --> 00:44:32,968
Not done.

680
00:44:34,303 --> 00:44:36,794
Really fast speed now.
Double up. That's it.

681
00:44:36,839 --> 00:44:39,330
That's it.
Get your knees up.

682
00:44:40,643 --> 00:44:43,271
Dad's training her
for the boys' team.

683
00:44:46,015 --> 00:44:47,380
They're both delusional.

684
00:44:47,416 --> 00:44:50,317
Go, go, go, go.
Faster feet. Like this.

685
00:45:03,833 --> 00:45:06,131
My God,
I think I'm gonna puke.

686
00:45:06,169 --> 00:45:08,569
So puke.

687
00:45:08,604 --> 00:45:10,799
Finish your suicides.
You owe me four more.

688
00:45:12,475 --> 00:45:13,806
You jerk.

689
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:19,441
Hundred and fifty dollars.

690
00:45:19,482 --> 00:45:22,576
You know, your paychecks haven't
been going into the account.

691
00:45:22,618 --> 00:45:24,882
Have you been cashing them?

692
00:45:28,424 --> 00:45:30,119
I quit my job.

693
00:45:31,894 --> 00:45:33,725
What?

694
00:45:35,565 --> 00:45:38,159
You didn't even
talk to me about it?

695
00:45:39,836 --> 00:45:42,566
Where have you been going?

696
00:45:42,605 --> 00:45:44,596
I just couldn't tell you.

697
00:45:47,076 --> 00:45:49,044
Something will turn up.

698
00:45:49,078 --> 00:45:50,909
What are we gonna live on?

699
00:45:52,148 --> 00:45:53,809
I'm not gonna lose
another child.

700
00:45:55,384 --> 00:45:57,784
Forty-seven.

701
00:45:57,820 --> 00:45:59,981
Forty-eight.

702
00:46:00,022 --> 00:46:01,649
Forty-nine.

703
00:46:01,691 --> 00:46:03,056
All right. Chin-up.

704
00:46:03,092 --> 00:46:04,957
- What?
- Let's go.

705
00:46:08,197 --> 00:46:09,994
All right, give me ten.

706
00:46:10,032 --> 00:46:11,522
Did Johnny do ten?

707
00:46:11,567 --> 00:46:12,795
At least. Let's go.

708
00:46:16,105 --> 00:46:18,164
One.

709
00:46:20,977 --> 00:46:22,569
Two.

710
00:46:22,612 --> 00:46:25,706
Check the pot pie
in about twenty minutes.

711
00:46:25,748 --> 00:46:27,875
Where are you going, Mom?

712
00:46:27,917 --> 00:46:29,282
My other job.

713
00:46:29,318 --> 00:46:31,445
Ask your father.

714
00:46:34,757 --> 00:46:36,224
'Cause I'm not working...

715
00:46:36,259 --> 00:46:39,956
she picked up a couple
extra shifts at the hospital.

716
00:46:41,097 --> 00:46:43,031
Let's go.

717
00:46:43,065 --> 00:46:44,589
Come on.

718
00:46:47,169 --> 00:46:48,864
Here's the itinerary.

719
00:46:50,273 --> 00:46:51,740
We get to this club...

720
00:46:51,774 --> 00:46:53,332
that's having
this battle of the bands, right?

721
00:46:53,376 --> 00:46:55,139
It's gonna be amazing.

722
00:46:55,177 --> 00:46:56,439
You're gonna love it.

723
00:46:56,479 --> 00:46:58,037
But, Jena,
it is a school night.

724
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:59,308
It's the summer.

725
00:46:59,348 --> 00:47:02,249
I have summer session,
plus I'm training.

726
00:47:02,285 --> 00:47:04,446
People are talking.

727
00:47:04,487 --> 00:47:06,648
You're committing
social suicide.

728
00:47:06,689 --> 00:47:07,883
I don't care.

729
00:47:07,924 --> 00:47:09,357
Hold my feet.

730
00:47:09,392 --> 00:47:14,386
Gracie, you've always had
your athletic interests.

731
00:47:14,430 --> 00:47:15,727
But come on...

732
00:47:15,765 --> 00:47:20,668
girls who play sports at our age
are considered lesbos.

733
00:47:22,171 --> 00:47:23,661
I can like boys and sports.

734
00:47:23,706 --> 00:47:25,731
I know that,
and you know that...

735
00:47:25,775 --> 00:47:30,109
but that's not how they see it.

736
00:47:31,247 --> 00:47:32,874
They or you?

737
00:47:34,183 --> 00:47:35,707
Well, if they think
you're a dyke...

738
00:47:35,751 --> 00:47:38,549
then I am, too,
by association.

739
00:47:38,587 --> 00:47:40,214
Well, then, don't associate.

740
00:47:41,657 --> 00:47:44,626
Fine. You know what?
Maybe you are a lesbo.

741
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:46,218
You were just
the last one to know.

742
00:47:47,596 --> 00:47:50,326
And that bird's too freaking big
for that cage, by the way.

743
00:47:52,435 --> 00:47:53,697
Come here.

744
00:47:53,736 --> 00:47:55,363
What?

745
00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:59,132
I'm gonna toss this little guy.
Catch and cradle it.

746
00:47:59,175 --> 00:48:01,905
- Don't let it break.
- Okay.

747
00:48:01,944 --> 00:48:03,969
With your foot.

748
00:48:04,013 --> 00:48:05,776
With my foot?

749
00:48:05,815 --> 00:48:07,077
Watch.

750
00:48:09,752 --> 00:48:11,777
Soft as a pillow.

751
00:48:11,821 --> 00:48:13,880
Ooh, ooh, ooh.
Here you go. Ready?

752
00:48:15,891 --> 00:48:17,586
You try.

753
00:48:23,866 --> 00:48:24,890
Oh.

754
00:48:28,070 --> 00:48:30,004
Just cradle it.

755
00:48:31,741 --> 00:48:34,642
Okay, here. You try.

756
00:48:38,214 --> 00:48:40,808
So boys' varsity team...

757
00:48:40,850 --> 00:48:42,340
think I can do it?

758
00:48:42,385 --> 00:48:44,012
Try out or make the team?

759
00:48:44,053 --> 00:48:46,283
The boys are just...

760
00:48:46,322 --> 00:48:47,880
Worried about all of them
or just one?

761
00:48:50,726 --> 00:48:53,320
Kyle's a jerk.

762
00:48:53,362 --> 00:48:55,592
If you want to
play with boys...

763
00:48:55,631 --> 00:48:57,258
you're gonna have to start
training with them.

764
00:49:01,937 --> 00:49:05,202
# Tonight there's gonna be
a jailbreak #

765
00:49:05,241 --> 00:49:08,677
# Somewhere in this town #

766
00:49:08,711 --> 00:49:12,078
# See, me and the boys
we don't like it #

767
00:49:12,114 --> 00:49:15,777
# So we're getting up
and going down #

768
00:49:15,818 --> 00:49:19,379
# Hiding low,
looking right to left #

769
00:49:19,422 --> 00:49:23,188
# If you see us coming,
I think it's best to move away #

770
00:49:23,225 --> 00:49:28,629
# Do you hear what I say
from under my breath? #

771
00:49:28,664 --> 00:49:31,963
# Tonight there's
gonna be a jailbreak #

772
00:49:32,001 --> 00:49:34,196
Hey, Gracie.
Did you see that, huh?

773
00:49:34,236 --> 00:49:38,104
That's how you do it,
unless you did.

774
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:40,438
All right,
set it up again, boys.

775
00:49:40,476 --> 00:49:43,274
Okay.

776
00:49:43,312 --> 00:49:47,612
Hey, if you're going, go.
Forget Kyle.

777
00:49:52,888 --> 00:49:54,412
Gracie's gonna play.

778
00:49:57,393 --> 00:49:59,793
- All right. You take it.
- All right.

779
00:49:59,829 --> 00:50:01,023
Yeah.

780
00:50:01,063 --> 00:50:02,826
Curt, step out for a second.
Donny, Scott.

781
00:50:02,865 --> 00:50:04,730
Craig, step back.

782
00:50:04,767 --> 00:50:06,598
No, no, no, no.

783
00:50:06,635 --> 00:50:07,727
Let Gracie take it.

784
00:50:07,770 --> 00:50:09,032
Yeah.

785
00:50:09,071 --> 00:50:10,333
You gotta have some
natural talent in there, right?

786
00:50:10,372 --> 00:50:11,839
Yeah, come on, Gracie.
Show us what you got.

787
00:50:11,874 --> 00:50:13,501
She is a Bowen.

788
00:50:13,542 --> 00:50:14,873
Oh, oh, oh.

789
00:50:14,910 --> 00:50:16,741
Oh, come on.

790
00:50:16,779 --> 00:50:19,714
- Yeah, she got you beat, man.
- You can, Gracie.

791
00:50:19,748 --> 00:50:22,148
Come on, Gracie.

792
00:50:22,184 --> 00:50:24,152
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

793
00:50:28,224 --> 00:50:30,158
There you go.

794
00:50:30,192 --> 00:50:31,989
You gotta be quicker, Gracie.

795
00:50:32,027 --> 00:50:33,221
Man, that's all right.

796
00:50:33,262 --> 00:50:35,253
Ooh hoo hoo hoo!

797
00:50:38,134 --> 00:50:40,659
Yeah, yeah.
You gotta be good.

798
00:50:40,703 --> 00:50:43,501
Hey, Donny.
Show her your moves.

799
00:50:43,539 --> 00:50:44,631
Boogie-woogie. Boogie.

800
00:50:48,410 --> 00:50:50,275
Come on. Come on.

801
00:50:50,312 --> 00:50:51,711
Here it is. You comin'?

802
00:50:51,747 --> 00:50:53,146
Here it is!

803
00:50:53,182 --> 00:50:54,274
Take it, come on.

804
00:50:54,884 --> 00:50:55,873
Boo.

805
00:50:55,918 --> 00:50:57,715
You want the ball?
Go get it.

806
00:51:00,823 --> 00:51:01,881
Whoo.

807
00:51:01,924 --> 00:51:04,620
Oh, oh, oh.

808
00:51:07,663 --> 00:51:08,652
Gracie.

809
00:51:08,697 --> 00:51:10,665
What the hell are you doing?

810
00:51:10,699 --> 00:51:11,961
It wasn't hard.

811
00:51:13,102 --> 00:51:16,196
- You all right?
- Gracie, don't go.

812
00:51:18,274 --> 00:51:20,037
Is that all she's got?

813
00:51:20,075 --> 00:51:21,940
Bye-bye, Gracie.

814
00:51:25,481 --> 00:51:26,641
Watch it.

815
00:51:28,317 --> 00:51:29,944
I'm ready
for my real training.

816
00:51:29,985 --> 00:51:31,282
Oh, you think you're ready?

817
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:33,618
With the ball.

818
00:51:33,656 --> 00:51:35,590
I don't want to just
barely survive out there.

819
00:51:35,624 --> 00:51:38,092
I want you to train me
like you did Johnny.

820
00:51:39,828 --> 00:51:41,261
If you want to
compete, Gracie...

821
00:51:41,297 --> 00:51:43,390
- Yeah?
- You gotta win the ball.

822
00:51:43,432 --> 00:51:46,924
You gotta take position.
Ready? Get the ball.

823
00:51:46,969 --> 00:51:49,130
Go, go, go, go.
Peter. Peter.

824
00:51:49,171 --> 00:51:50,331
You're not
helping anybody.

825
00:51:50,372 --> 00:51:51,999
What did he do?

826
00:51:52,041 --> 00:51:53,201
He let you get the ball.

827
00:51:53,242 --> 00:51:54,368
- All right?
- No, he didn't.

828
00:51:54,410 --> 00:51:56,275
Don't do that.
You get it, all right?

829
00:51:56,312 --> 00:51:57,836
Just so much...
Be aggressive, tougher.

830
00:51:57,880 --> 00:51:59,905
You gotta want and believe
that you can take the ball.

831
00:51:59,949 --> 00:52:01,348
Go, go, go.

832
00:52:03,219 --> 00:52:05,380
Did you hear me?

833
00:52:05,421 --> 00:52:06,911
You gotta get your body
in front of his.

834
00:52:06,956 --> 00:52:08,821
Just like that, all right?
Help me out here.

835
00:52:08,857 --> 00:52:09,949
You played with Johnny,
right?

836
00:52:09,992 --> 00:52:12,256
- We goofed around.
- You did drills.

837
00:52:12,294 --> 00:52:13,693
We didn't really
call them that.

838
00:52:13,729 --> 00:52:15,390
Gracie.

839
00:52:15,431 --> 00:52:16,625
How did you teach Johnny?

840
00:52:16,665 --> 00:52:19,099
I didn't.
He was a natural, remember?

841
00:52:29,511 --> 00:52:31,672
Wow. Is that Johnny?

842
00:52:31,714 --> 00:52:33,204
That's me.

843
00:52:33,249 --> 00:52:34,477
You guys had
the same number?

844
00:52:34,516 --> 00:52:35,881
Yeah, number seven,
both of us.

845
00:52:37,253 --> 00:52:41,212
It's junior year.
You saw this before, Grace.

846
00:52:41,257 --> 00:52:42,849
Never.

847
00:52:42,891 --> 00:52:44,859
That was before
I hurt my knee.

848
00:52:44,893 --> 00:52:48,522
Oh, oh, wait. Wait.
You gotta watch this move.

849
00:52:50,733 --> 00:52:52,223
- Ooh.
- Whoa.

850
00:52:52,268 --> 00:52:54,202
Smoked him.

851
00:52:54,236 --> 00:52:55,225
Baff. Right there.

852
00:52:55,271 --> 00:52:57,671
- Oh!
- Smoked that guy.

853
00:52:57,706 --> 00:52:59,333
You were like a star.

854
00:52:59,375 --> 00:53:00,740
Well, not so much.

855
00:53:01,944 --> 00:53:04,071
Didn't have anybody
looking out for me.

856
00:53:04,113 --> 00:53:05,671
What about Granddad?

857
00:53:05,714 --> 00:53:08,444
What about him?

858
00:53:09,652 --> 00:53:11,381
He never saw anything in me.

859
00:53:23,899 --> 00:53:25,230
This is what I used to do.
Simple move.

860
00:53:25,267 --> 00:53:26,529
You just wait for the guy's
weight to shift...

861
00:53:26,568 --> 00:53:28,001
and then cut the ball.
Simple like this.

862
00:53:28,037 --> 00:53:29,800
Come on.
Come on. Come on. Right?

863
00:53:29,838 --> 00:53:31,533
Bam. Baff.

864
00:53:31,573 --> 00:53:32,597
I'm gonna try
and take it from you.

865
00:53:32,641 --> 00:53:34,302
If the angle's not sharp enough,
I'm gonna take it.

866
00:53:34,343 --> 00:53:36,072
Just look at what I do
and do it.

867
00:53:38,147 --> 00:53:41,446
No, no, Grace. No.
Now, try this. Ready?

868
00:53:41,483 --> 00:53:43,178
- Are you paying attention?
- Yeah.

869
00:53:43,218 --> 00:53:44,651
Good. You gotta get it.
Watch this.

870
00:53:44,687 --> 00:53:46,382
Like that. Block, and over.

871
00:53:46,422 --> 00:53:47,616
Baff. Goal.

872
00:53:47,656 --> 00:53:49,590
Come on.

873
00:53:49,625 --> 00:53:51,490
You see what I did, right?

874
00:53:54,263 --> 00:53:55,457
Come on, Grace.

875
00:53:55,497 --> 00:53:58,057
One last time,
I'll show you. Ready?

876
00:53:59,435 --> 00:54:01,699
Baff. Goal.

877
00:54:01,737 --> 00:54:03,898
Kingston, October 23rd.

878
00:54:03,939 --> 00:54:05,600
I think it's time to stop.

879
00:54:05,641 --> 00:54:07,472
We got a couple more minutes.

880
00:54:07,509 --> 00:54:09,602
I think
it's too much for her.

881
00:54:09,645 --> 00:54:11,010
Too much for her?

882
00:54:11,046 --> 00:54:12,843
Does it look like
it's too much for her, huh?

883
00:54:14,049 --> 00:54:17,109
One, two...

884
00:54:17,152 --> 00:54:18,676
three...

885
00:54:18,721 --> 00:54:20,552
four...

886
00:54:20,589 --> 00:54:21,783
five.

887
00:54:21,824 --> 00:54:25,191
Carp, carp, shift.

888
00:54:25,227 --> 00:54:26,489
Carp, carp, shift.

889
00:54:30,999 --> 00:54:32,091
# Rock steady, baby #

890
00:54:32,134 --> 00:54:33,328
Stretch it! Stretch it!

891
00:54:33,369 --> 00:54:35,997
Stretch!

892
00:54:36,038 --> 00:54:37,027
# Let's call this song #

893
00:54:37,072 --> 00:54:40,064
Yeah! Yeah! Goal!

894
00:54:40,109 --> 00:54:41,098
Whoo-hoo!

895
00:54:41,143 --> 00:54:42,269
# Step n' move your hips
with a feelin' #

896
00:54:42,311 --> 00:54:44,973
# From side to side #

897
00:54:45,013 --> 00:54:47,243
# Sit yourself down
in your car #

898
00:54:47,282 --> 00:54:49,750
# And take a ride,
and while you're movin' #

899
00:54:49,785 --> 00:54:53,221
# Rock steady,
rock steady, baby #

900
00:54:54,356 --> 00:54:57,382
# Let's call this song
exactly what it is #

901
00:54:57,426 --> 00:54:58,450
# What it is,
what it is, what it is #

902
00:54:58,494 --> 00:54:59,688
Come on, Grace.
Quicker, quicker.

903
00:54:59,728 --> 00:55:01,889
# And, Lord, I feel it #

904
00:55:01,930 --> 00:55:03,124
# Come dance around #

905
00:55:03,165 --> 00:55:05,861
# What it is
'cause I might be doin' #

906
00:55:05,901 --> 00:55:08,028
# This funky dance
all night, oh #

907
00:55:08,070 --> 00:55:10,630
Three, four, five.

908
00:55:10,672 --> 00:55:14,073
Three, four, five.

909
00:55:14,109 --> 00:55:16,873
One, two, three.

910
00:55:16,912 --> 00:55:18,903
One, two...

911
00:55:18,947 --> 00:55:22,849
Six... come on... seven, eight.

912
00:55:24,086 --> 00:55:26,316
Strike it.

913
00:55:26,889 --> 00:55:29,255
Go. Strike it.

914
00:55:35,297 --> 00:55:37,356
# Rock #

915
00:55:37,399 --> 00:55:39,594
# Steady #

916
00:55:39,635 --> 00:55:41,899
# Rock #

917
00:55:41,937 --> 00:55:44,371
# Steady #

918
00:55:44,406 --> 00:55:46,601
# Rock #

919
00:55:46,642 --> 00:55:48,974
# Steady #

920
00:55:49,011 --> 00:55:51,070
# Rock #

921
00:55:51,113 --> 00:55:52,307
# Steady #

922
00:56:00,122 --> 00:56:02,022
Good. Good.

923
00:56:04,827 --> 00:56:06,852
You're doin' good, Grace.

924
00:56:22,244 --> 00:56:24,405
What?

925
00:56:24,446 --> 00:56:26,778
This came today
from the school board.

926
00:56:26,815 --> 00:56:28,339
Here, Mike.

927
00:56:30,252 --> 00:56:31,844
They're not
gonna let you play.

928
00:56:31,887 --> 00:56:34,117
What?

929
00:56:34,156 --> 00:56:36,420
No.

930
00:56:36,458 --> 00:56:38,449
No.

931
00:56:40,295 --> 00:56:41,728
How could they turn me down?

932
00:56:41,763 --> 00:56:45,290
Gracie, you're in great shape,
and if you want...

933
00:56:45,334 --> 00:56:46,358
Dad talked to Mr. C...

934
00:56:46,401 --> 00:56:48,096
and he said
you can play field hockey.

935
00:56:48,136 --> 00:56:50,229
Field hockey?

936
00:56:51,306 --> 00:56:54,798
You never thought
I was good enough.

937
00:56:54,843 --> 00:56:56,936
You didn't think
I could do this, did you?

938
00:57:01,483 --> 00:57:02,882
What?

939
00:57:02,918 --> 00:57:04,579
You went behind her back?

940
00:57:10,926 --> 00:57:11,984
My dad wants me
to play field hockey.

941
00:57:12,027 --> 00:57:14,188
This is unbelievable.

942
00:57:14,229 --> 00:57:16,129
Hey, Peter, you coming?

943
00:57:16,164 --> 00:57:18,155
We only got the field
for an hour.

944
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:19,690
I gotta go, Grace.

945
00:57:21,203 --> 00:57:23,262
Yeah, you better.

946
00:57:26,041 --> 00:57:27,303
I get it.

947
00:57:27,342 --> 00:57:29,003
You're hoping that Kyle's
gonna help you...

948
00:57:29,044 --> 00:57:30,409
get a spot on the team, right?

949
00:57:30,445 --> 00:57:32,845
And I was just there
to help improve your game.

950
00:57:32,881 --> 00:57:35,372
Peter, let's go.

951
00:57:43,625 --> 00:57:46,185
Shut up.

952
00:57:48,564 --> 00:57:50,122
Happy?

953
00:57:50,165 --> 00:57:52,099
This isn't you,
lying around here...

954
00:57:52,134 --> 00:57:53,863
when you could be fighting back.

955
00:57:53,902 --> 00:57:55,369
The tryouts are this Saturday.

956
00:57:55,404 --> 00:57:57,736
You don't want me to play.

957
00:57:57,773 --> 00:58:00,708
Yeah, that's true. I don't.

958
00:58:00,742 --> 00:58:02,232
That's not my choice.

959
00:58:04,346 --> 00:58:05,870
Do you know
what I wanted to be?

960
00:58:05,914 --> 00:58:07,779
What?

961
00:58:07,816 --> 00:58:09,613
I wanted to be a surgeon.

962
00:58:09,651 --> 00:58:10,640
You?

963
00:58:10,686 --> 00:58:11,846
Mm-hmm.

964
00:58:11,887 --> 00:58:15,050
I wanted to be
in the emergency room.

965
00:58:15,090 --> 00:58:17,354
So now I'm a nurse.

966
00:58:17,392 --> 00:58:19,622
That's as close as I could get.

967
00:58:21,830 --> 00:58:25,027
So if you want to
limit yourself, that's fine.

968
00:58:25,067 --> 00:58:28,195
But don't let other people
do it for you.

969
00:58:37,546 --> 00:58:39,070
Excuse me.

970
00:58:39,114 --> 00:58:42,277
I'm here
to see a C. Bowsher.

971
00:58:42,317 --> 00:58:43,841
And you are?

972
00:58:43,885 --> 00:58:45,375
I really need to see him.

973
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:46,682
Her.

974
00:58:46,722 --> 00:58:48,553
I'm Connie Bowsher.

975
00:58:48,590 --> 00:58:50,785
Can we talk about this?

976
00:58:55,597 --> 00:58:57,087
Couldn't change their mind?

977
00:58:57,132 --> 00:58:58,997
I have to file an appeal
by tomorrow.

978
00:58:59,034 --> 00:59:01,969
- Need help?
- From you?

979
00:59:14,983 --> 00:59:16,007
Gracie.

980
00:59:20,689 --> 00:59:22,281
Gracie, come out.

981
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:46,614
Bowsher just called.

982
00:59:46,648 --> 00:59:48,445
The board's gonna hold
a hearing for her.

983
00:59:48,483 --> 00:59:50,246
Have you told her yet?

984
00:59:50,285 --> 00:59:52,412
I'm on my way.

985
00:59:52,454 --> 00:59:55,787
Bryan, is she good enough?

986
00:59:55,824 --> 00:59:58,486
If they let her play,
can she do it?

987
00:59:58,527 --> 01:00:01,223
Yeah. Sure.

988
01:00:01,263 --> 01:00:03,857
Well, if you don't
believe in her...

989
01:00:10,672 --> 01:00:15,041
And, finally, Title lx
of the federal mandate...

990
01:00:15,077 --> 01:00:18,137
requires equal access
to sports for girls.

991
01:00:18,180 --> 01:00:20,671
Thank you.

992
01:00:20,716 --> 01:00:24,083
Coach Connors, tell us
what about Title lx?

993
01:00:24,119 --> 01:00:27,646
Title lx means there's money
for a girls' soccer team...

994
01:00:27,689 --> 01:00:28,917
but there's no interest.

995
01:00:28,957 --> 01:00:30,254
Why is that?

996
01:00:30,292 --> 01:00:32,487
Soccer's not considered
a girls' sport.

997
01:00:32,527 --> 01:00:35,223
The girls I know would rather
watch it than play it.

998
01:00:35,263 --> 01:00:37,823
We offer girls' gymnastics...

999
01:00:37,866 --> 01:00:42,701
field hockey, badminton,
tennis, swimming, softball.

1000
01:00:42,738 --> 01:00:44,433
Any one of them could use
a skilled athlete...

1001
01:00:44,473 --> 01:00:45,701
like Miss Bowen.

1002
01:00:45,741 --> 01:00:47,971
Everyone would
be afraid to play hard...

1003
01:00:48,009 --> 01:00:50,842
because they'll be worried
about her breaking something...

1004
01:00:50,879 --> 01:00:52,369
or whining
'cause she's bleeding.

1005
01:00:52,414 --> 01:00:54,814
She can't run as fast.

1006
01:00:54,850 --> 01:00:57,546
She can't kick as hard.

1007
01:00:57,586 --> 01:01:00,214
I don't want to lose
'cause of her.

1008
01:01:04,226 --> 01:01:06,194
Just because she's
Johnny's sister and he died...

1009
01:01:06,228 --> 01:01:07,718
doesn't mean
she should play.

1010
01:01:07,763 --> 01:01:11,927
I look for speed,
ball control, passing ability.

1011
01:01:11,967 --> 01:01:15,994
All abilities a girl could
demonstrate as well as a boy.

1012
01:01:16,037 --> 01:01:17,868
Never seen it.

1013
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:20,439
I'd like to say something.

1014
01:01:22,444 --> 01:01:23,433
Yes?

1015
01:01:23,478 --> 01:01:25,002
I'm Lindsay Bowen.

1016
01:01:25,046 --> 01:01:26,638
I'm Gracie's mother.

1017
01:01:26,681 --> 01:01:28,615
You have to be
on the sheet to speak.

1018
01:01:31,787 --> 01:01:34,813
There. She's on the sheet.

1019
01:01:34,856 --> 01:01:38,053
Please, Mrs. Bowen,
go ahead.

1020
01:01:39,961 --> 01:01:44,694
I know that all of you
must be asking if you were me...

1021
01:01:44,733 --> 01:01:48,032
would you let your daughter play
on a boys' team?

1022
01:01:48,069 --> 01:01:50,970
Boys play really rough,
and, um, she could get hurt.

1023
01:01:51,006 --> 01:01:52,667
But I've seen her.

1024
01:01:52,707 --> 01:01:55,733
I've seen her go out
in the cold, in the rain...

1025
01:01:55,777 --> 01:01:57,176
in the dark.

1026
01:01:57,212 --> 01:01:58,702
She is fierce.

1027
01:01:58,747 --> 01:02:01,181
She wants to win.

1028
01:02:01,216 --> 01:02:04,242
She will not give up
because she has a dream.

1029
01:02:04,286 --> 01:02:07,722
For all of my boys,
soccer is and was...

1030
01:02:07,756 --> 01:02:09,189
the most important thing
in their life...

1031
01:02:09,224 --> 01:02:12,716
and it is
the same for Gracie.

1032
01:02:12,761 --> 01:02:14,285
She loves competing.

1033
01:02:14,329 --> 01:02:17,628
She loves
that win-or-lose life.

1034
01:02:17,666 --> 01:02:20,066
L... I don't.

1035
01:02:23,872 --> 01:02:25,703
It's been lonely.

1036
01:02:27,475 --> 01:02:29,409
Gracie's my only daughter...

1037
01:02:29,444 --> 01:02:31,674
but I would rather miss her
than have her miss something...

1038
01:02:31,713 --> 01:02:34,705
that is
so very part of her being.

1039
01:02:36,585 --> 01:02:38,553
Thank you.

1040
01:02:54,870 --> 01:02:56,667
The board split.

1041
01:02:56,705 --> 01:02:58,639
I'm afraid I had
to cast the final vote.

1042
01:02:58,673 --> 01:02:59,697
She gets to play?

1043
01:02:59,741 --> 01:03:01,470
To try out.

1044
01:03:01,509 --> 01:03:03,500
Thank you so much.

1045
01:03:03,545 --> 01:03:05,035
It's up to Coach Colasanti...

1046
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:07,014
to decide
if you'll make the team.

1047
01:03:07,048 --> 01:03:08,913
It's up to Gracie.

1048
01:03:08,950 --> 01:03:11,441
- You got to stretch out.
- Yeah, Dad.

1049
01:03:11,486 --> 01:03:13,511
Yeah. But don't
stretch out too fast.

1050
01:03:13,555 --> 01:03:14,715
I don't want you to cramp up.

1051
01:03:14,756 --> 01:03:15,950
I got it.

1052
01:03:20,128 --> 01:03:22,187
There's Johnny.

1053
01:03:22,230 --> 01:03:25,165
Dad, did you ever wish
I was a boy?

1054
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:27,293
No. No.

1055
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:33,437
Grace, it's different.

1056
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:47,545
Just easier with Johnny.

1057
01:03:47,589 --> 01:03:49,523
I don't know why.

1058
01:03:52,294 --> 01:03:54,728
Sometimes I just
had trouble talking to you.

1059
01:04:00,268 --> 01:04:01,701
Is that
why you coached Johnny?

1060
01:04:05,807 --> 01:04:07,274
I coach you now.

1061
01:04:13,882 --> 01:04:17,113
Okay, boys, let's go.

1062
01:04:23,625 --> 01:04:26,321
Coach is gonna make
three cuts today...

1063
01:04:26,361 --> 01:04:28,226
this morning, after lunch,
then tonight.

1064
01:04:28,263 --> 01:04:30,959
So, uh, don't show him
everything in the first hour.

1065
01:04:30,999 --> 01:04:32,762
Can you hand me that?

1066
01:04:36,805 --> 01:04:38,966
Just pace yourself.
Be a team player.

1067
01:04:39,007 --> 01:04:41,441
Yeah, like I'm not gonna
stick out already.

1068
01:04:41,476 --> 01:04:44,070
Hey, Johnny once told me
about an amazing girl...

1069
01:04:44,112 --> 01:04:46,080
who hit a bottle off
the hood of a car...

1070
01:04:46,114 --> 01:04:48,139
barefooted
from twenty yards out.

1071
01:04:53,121 --> 01:04:58,286
Hey, Gracie,
I know you can do this.

1072
01:05:00,295 --> 01:05:05,062
Group A: Rhodes, Manley,
Jasko, Wicker, Fogel.

1073
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:07,830
Group B:
Keshawn, Mulstock...

1074
01:05:07,869 --> 01:05:10,667
Martho, McCarthy,
Abbott, Delilo...

1075
01:05:10,705 --> 01:05:13,833
Alston, Ross, Gracie Bowen.

1076
01:05:19,214 --> 01:05:20,306
All right, break.

1077
01:05:23,318 --> 01:05:25,377
Quicker, quicker, quicker.

1078
01:05:34,963 --> 01:05:36,828
Switch.

1079
01:05:48,143 --> 01:05:50,077
Come on.
Teddy, Teddy, come on.

1080
01:05:50,111 --> 01:05:52,204
Quicker, quicker. Switch.

1081
01:05:55,316 --> 01:05:57,477
Call for it. Call for it.

1082
01:05:57,519 --> 01:05:58,918
There you go.
Come on.

1083
01:05:58,953 --> 01:06:01,080
Quicker, quicker, quicker.

1084
01:06:03,525 --> 01:06:05,459
Right here.

1085
01:06:11,399 --> 01:06:13,959
She's not bad.

1086
01:06:14,002 --> 01:06:15,697
I've seen better.

1087
01:06:31,119 --> 01:06:33,053
Go. Come on, Teddy.
See some fight.

1088
01:06:33,088 --> 01:06:36,251
Go. Go.

1089
01:06:36,291 --> 01:06:37,883
See? Come on. Go.

1090
01:06:37,926 --> 01:06:39,587
Get there, Jerome. Get there.

1091
01:06:41,062 --> 01:06:43,724
How's she doin'?

1092
01:06:43,765 --> 01:06:45,824
Yeah.

1093
01:06:45,867 --> 01:06:48,802
Let's go. Let's go.

1094
01:06:48,837 --> 01:06:50,168
Who's gonna be first?

1095
01:06:51,539 --> 01:06:53,370
Let's go.

1096
01:06:54,242 --> 01:06:56,142
Let's go.

1097
01:06:57,078 --> 01:06:58,409
Go.

1098
01:07:01,549 --> 01:07:03,244
Go.

1099
01:07:09,357 --> 01:07:10,722
Shoot it. Shoot it.

1100
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:15,027
Bowen, look at me.

1101
01:07:15,063 --> 01:07:17,964
When I say "shoot it,"
damn it, you shoot it.

1102
01:07:25,874 --> 01:07:29,207
I made it.
Only one more cut.

1103
01:07:29,244 --> 01:07:30,541
What's wrong?

1104
01:07:30,578 --> 01:07:32,637
You passed 'cause you
didn't want to get hit.

1105
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:35,114
Yeah, because they were
kicking my butt.

1106
01:07:35,150 --> 01:07:37,710
You got to take it, Gracie.
Then you got to give it.

1107
01:07:37,752 --> 01:07:40,721
You got to show 'em
you're no different.

1108
01:07:40,755 --> 01:07:43,053
What the hell's Mr. C.
Thinkin' anyway?

1109
01:07:43,091 --> 01:07:44,456
He has
to make it look real.

1110
01:07:44,492 --> 01:07:46,687
He'll cut her tonight.

1111
01:07:48,096 --> 01:07:50,257
Eat.

1112
01:07:50,298 --> 01:07:51,822
Go on. Eat.

1113
01:07:55,003 --> 01:07:57,301
No way she
finishes tonight.

1114
01:08:08,249 --> 01:08:11,776
Listen up.
I got four yellow shirts here.

1115
01:08:11,819 --> 01:08:15,846
I want to see
who can score a goal.

1116
01:08:15,890 --> 01:08:18,290
Only two of you make the team.

1117
01:08:19,661 --> 01:08:21,526
Break.

1118
01:08:22,830 --> 01:08:24,764
Ready?

1119
01:08:34,709 --> 01:08:37,007
Give me the ball!
Give me the ball!

1120
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:47,312
- Oh!
- She can take it.

1121
01:08:47,355 --> 01:08:49,823
Sorry.

1122
01:08:49,857 --> 01:08:51,848
Bite me.

1123
01:08:53,328 --> 01:08:55,387
Good work.

1124
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:01,462
Come on.
Here, here, here, here, here.

1125
01:09:01,502 --> 01:09:03,367
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

1126
01:09:03,404 --> 01:09:05,668
Coming left. Coming left.
Here.

1127
01:09:05,707 --> 01:09:07,265
Left.

1128
01:09:11,212 --> 01:09:13,806
Okay. Okay.

1129
01:09:14,482 --> 01:09:15,847
You all right?

1130
01:09:15,883 --> 01:09:17,475
I was wondering the same
about your whistle.

1131
01:09:17,518 --> 01:09:20,146
Feel free to blow it
at any time.

1132
01:09:20,188 --> 01:09:21,951
You wanted to play
with the boys.

1133
01:09:36,938 --> 01:09:38,667
Come on.

1134
01:09:40,108 --> 01:09:42,576
Come on.

1135
01:09:48,349 --> 01:09:49,839
Go, go, cross.

1136
01:09:49,884 --> 01:09:51,545
Pass it.

1137
01:09:55,890 --> 01:09:56,914
Yes.

1138
01:09:58,159 --> 01:10:00,855
- Yes! Yes! Yes!
- That's my girl!

1139
01:10:05,466 --> 01:10:07,195
All right.
Split into pairs.

1140
01:10:07,235 --> 01:10:09,260
We'll finish up with headers.

1141
01:10:09,304 --> 01:10:11,898
Last hour of tryouts.

1142
01:10:11,939 --> 01:10:13,998
Cutting it a little close,
aren't we?

1143
01:10:14,042 --> 01:10:16,636
Coach C. Said to switch.
Work with someone new.

1144
01:10:16,678 --> 01:10:18,703
I didn't hear him say nothin'.

1145
01:10:18,746 --> 01:10:21,647
That's 'cause you got your
head up your ass. Now, move.

1146
01:10:24,252 --> 01:10:26,482
All right. Let's go for it.

1147
01:10:34,996 --> 01:10:36,258
What was that?

1148
01:10:36,297 --> 01:10:39,357
I saw that, Rhodes!

1149
01:10:42,670 --> 01:10:44,604
Bowen, you're out.

1150
01:10:44,639 --> 01:10:46,163
Screw you.

1151
01:10:46,207 --> 01:10:49,643
- What did you say?
- "Good luck to all of you."

1152
01:10:49,677 --> 01:10:51,474
That's what I thought.

1153
01:10:51,512 --> 01:10:53,605
Get lost, Bowen, before
my hearing comes back.

1154
01:11:00,755 --> 01:11:03,815
Yeah, yeah. I know.

1155
01:11:03,858 --> 01:11:05,655
Yes.

1156
01:11:22,777 --> 01:11:24,039
Gracie. Gracie.

1157
01:11:29,150 --> 01:11:30,344
I know what you're gonna say.

1158
01:11:30,385 --> 01:11:31,818
I am good enough.

1159
01:11:31,853 --> 01:11:33,218
That's why your name's
on the board.

1160
01:11:33,254 --> 01:11:34,243
Yeah? Where?

1161
01:11:34,288 --> 01:11:36,688
- Junior varsity.
- Junior varsity.

1162
01:11:36,724 --> 01:11:38,248
If you're gonna be
the first girl on my team...

1163
01:11:38,292 --> 01:11:40,226
then you got
to be better than good.

1164
01:11:40,261 --> 01:11:42,092
And you got to act
like you deserve to be there.

1165
01:11:42,130 --> 01:11:44,690
- I do deserve it.
- I don't see it.

1166
01:11:46,634 --> 01:11:48,499
I offered your dad
a coaching job.

1167
01:11:58,312 --> 01:11:59,540
Hey.

1168
01:12:03,351 --> 01:12:05,148
I'm goin' back.

1169
01:12:05,186 --> 01:12:08,349
The supervisor put it down
as a leave of absence.

1170
01:12:08,389 --> 01:12:09,822
You hate that place.

1171
01:12:09,857 --> 01:12:14,021
Yep. And I'm working nights
at the warehouse.

1172
01:12:14,061 --> 01:12:17,189
But after work,
you get to coach.

1173
01:12:17,231 --> 01:12:19,165
I'm glad it
all worked out for you.

1174
01:12:20,268 --> 01:12:21,326
Hey.

1175
01:12:29,210 --> 01:12:30,871
Sometimes, you just take
what you're offered...

1176
01:12:30,912 --> 01:12:32,004
and make the best of it,
you know.

1177
01:12:32,046 --> 01:12:34,037
Yeah, and eat
the shit sandwich.

1178
01:12:34,081 --> 01:12:36,174
I'm not doin' it. I quit.

1179
01:12:38,486 --> 01:12:39,817
Johnny was a star...

1180
01:12:39,854 --> 01:12:41,515
I don't want to hear about
Johnny.

1181
01:12:41,556 --> 01:12:43,023
Johnny's dead.

1182
01:12:48,196 --> 01:12:51,393
Johnny played more for me
than he played for himself.

1183
01:12:51,432 --> 01:12:53,764
You're different.
You truly love this game.

1184
01:12:53,801 --> 01:12:55,564
That's coaching crap.

1185
01:12:55,603 --> 01:12:57,332
Quit, why don't you, then?

1186
01:12:57,371 --> 01:12:58,998
But quit 'cause
you're not good enough.

1187
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:00,769
Quit 'cause you're never
gonna be good enough.

1188
01:13:00,808 --> 01:13:02,207
Don't quit because you got
your feelings hurt...

1189
01:13:02,243 --> 01:13:03,642
like a little girl!

1190
01:13:10,918 --> 01:13:13,443
You got to dig deep
and go out there...

1191
01:13:13,488 --> 01:13:15,217
as tough and strong as anyone.

1192
01:13:15,256 --> 01:13:16,416
I did.

1193
01:13:16,457 --> 01:13:19,017
No, you didn't.
I know what you can do.

1194
01:13:19,060 --> 01:13:20,391
But it's not enough
that I believe in you.

1195
01:13:20,428 --> 01:13:22,225
You got to make them all
believe in you.

1196
01:13:22,263 --> 01:13:24,823
And how do I do that?

1197
01:13:24,866 --> 01:13:27,096
You know what to do.

1198
01:13:59,333 --> 01:14:00,561
Good boy.

1199
01:14:21,622 --> 01:14:24,182
They practice today?

1200
01:14:24,225 --> 01:14:25,886
Are you gonna play J. V?

1201
01:14:25,927 --> 01:14:29,192
Yep. But I won't
be back till late.

1202
01:14:38,272 --> 01:14:40,001
Let's go, let's go.

1203
01:14:40,041 --> 01:14:41,167
- Down.
- G-O.

1204
01:14:41,208 --> 01:14:42,539
Let's go, let's go.

1205
01:14:42,577 --> 01:14:43,874
G-O.

1206
01:14:43,911 --> 01:14:46,004
Let's go, let's go.

1207
01:14:46,047 --> 01:14:47,036
G-O. Let's go, let's go.

1208
01:14:47,081 --> 01:14:49,276
Hey, Gracie.

1209
01:14:49,317 --> 01:14:51,376
Go get 'em.

1210
01:14:51,419 --> 01:14:52,716
G-O.

1211
01:14:52,753 --> 01:14:54,778
Let's go, let's go.

1212
01:14:59,894 --> 01:15:02,294
Down. Up.

1213
01:15:40,234 --> 01:15:42,327
Kyle didn't even want me
on the team, Gracie.

1214
01:15:42,370 --> 01:15:45,305
He just wanted to hang out
so we could talk about you.

1215
01:15:50,544 --> 01:15:53,012
I loved Johnny, Gracie.

1216
01:15:54,815 --> 01:15:56,783
He left me, too.

1217
01:15:59,620 --> 01:16:03,249
Anyway, I already have
a new best friend...

1218
01:16:03,290 --> 01:16:05,281
and I'm gonna stay here
with her until she's done.

1219
01:16:07,928 --> 01:16:11,728
If she decides she wants
some food, it's here, too.

1220
01:16:21,108 --> 01:16:23,167
Heard that's a good book.

1221
01:16:30,151 --> 01:16:31,641
We drew Kingston
for our first game.

1222
01:16:31,686 --> 01:16:32,914
The whole town's comin' out.

1223
01:16:35,423 --> 01:16:36,913
I want you there.

1224
01:16:36,957 --> 01:16:38,015
To play?

1225
01:16:38,059 --> 01:16:39,549
To support your team.

1226
01:16:39,593 --> 01:16:41,220
You mean to sit on the bench.

1227
01:16:44,432 --> 01:16:46,525
The team's
wearin' armbands for Johnny.

1228
01:17:15,963 --> 01:17:17,362
Go on.

1229
01:17:18,966 --> 01:17:20,558
Go.

1230
01:17:20,601 --> 01:17:22,796
You can do it.

1231
01:17:22,837 --> 01:17:24,828
Go.

1232
01:17:35,449 --> 01:17:36,575
You'll be fine.

1233
01:17:54,335 --> 01:17:55,324
- Let's go, boys.
- Yes, sir!

1234
01:17:55,369 --> 01:17:56,358
Go, go, go.

1235
01:17:56,403 --> 01:17:57,392
- Right.
- Let's move it up.

1236
01:17:57,438 --> 01:17:58,427
Yes...

1237
01:17:58,472 --> 01:18:00,497
We got a game to win.

1238
01:18:02,910 --> 01:18:05,435
G-O.

1239
01:18:05,479 --> 01:18:08,346
Let's go.

1240
01:18:20,728 --> 01:18:21,717
Let's go, boys.

1241
01:18:21,762 --> 01:18:23,423
Go, go, go!

1242
01:18:27,368 --> 01:18:28,892
I'm here
for the game, Coach.

1243
01:18:28,936 --> 01:18:29,925
Hey.

1244
01:18:29,970 --> 01:18:31,995
I got a jersey for you.

1245
01:18:39,814 --> 01:18:41,281
This was Johnny's.

1246
01:18:41,315 --> 01:18:44,011
Now it's yours.

1247
01:18:51,892 --> 01:18:53,723
Switch it. Switch it.

1248
01:18:53,761 --> 01:18:55,228
Close it up. Close it up.

1249
01:18:55,262 --> 01:18:57,355
Then move. Come on. Go on.

1250
01:18:57,398 --> 01:18:58,422
Take him out.

1251
01:18:59,867 --> 01:19:01,562
There it is.
There it is.

1252
01:19:02,870 --> 01:19:05,839
Oh!

1253
01:19:07,241 --> 01:19:08,799
Come on,
get back on defense!

1254
01:19:08,843 --> 01:19:10,071
Move it back!

1255
01:19:12,446 --> 01:19:15,176
Flatten out here.
Flatten out.

1256
01:19:16,717 --> 01:19:18,912
No cross.

1257
01:19:18,953 --> 01:19:20,477
Move it up.

1258
01:19:20,521 --> 01:19:22,352
Move it up, boys.

1259
01:19:24,225 --> 01:19:26,386
Switch it, switch it.
Switch the field.

1260
01:19:26,427 --> 01:19:28,190
Pressure.
Get pressure in there.

1261
01:19:29,964 --> 01:19:32,194
Yeah.

1262
01:19:38,372 --> 01:19:40,670
That's what we want!
That's what we want!

1263
01:19:40,708 --> 01:19:42,471
I'm on it. I'm on it.

1264
01:19:42,509 --> 01:19:44,909
I told you to cover
the far post.

1265
01:19:44,945 --> 01:19:47,937
Wicker, go in for Polo.

1266
01:19:49,116 --> 01:19:50,981
Move it, Wicker.

1267
01:19:51,018 --> 01:19:53,282
Pick him up.
Pick him up, pick him up.

1268
01:19:53,320 --> 01:19:55,049
Squeeze him, Donny,
squeeze him.

1269
01:19:57,758 --> 01:19:59,191
Pick it up. Pick it up.

1270
01:20:00,828 --> 01:20:02,227
Pick up the side.

1271
01:20:06,233 --> 01:20:07,461
Whoo-hoo!

1272
01:20:08,569 --> 01:20:09,934
Did you see that?

1273
01:20:09,970 --> 01:20:12,666
Did anybody pick him up?
No! He just walked in there!

1274
01:20:12,706 --> 01:20:14,037
Yeah!

1275
01:20:18,846 --> 01:20:21,644
It's sudden death overtime.
Whoever scores wins.

1276
01:20:21,682 --> 01:20:23,445
I'm not a moron.

1277
01:20:37,364 --> 01:20:38,422
That's a nice hit.

1278
01:20:40,901 --> 01:20:43,096
Peter. Peter.

1279
01:20:43,137 --> 01:20:44,502
Tell Kyle
to stay down. Hurry.

1280
01:20:47,174 --> 01:20:49,335
Ref, I'm makin' a change.

1281
01:20:49,376 --> 01:20:51,970
Coach, Coach, I'm fine.
I can still play.

1282
01:20:52,012 --> 01:20:53,741
Bowen.

1283
01:20:55,449 --> 01:20:57,314
Bowen.

1284
01:20:57,351 --> 01:20:59,080
Get up here.

1285
01:21:04,191 --> 01:21:07,092
I want you to take
the free kick.

1286
01:21:07,127 --> 01:21:08,651
Can you do it?

1287
01:21:14,268 --> 01:21:16,600
Okay, get in there.

1288
01:21:20,341 --> 01:21:23,071
Whatever you do,
hit the target.

1289
01:21:26,246 --> 01:21:28,544
Big freakin' mistake.

1290
01:21:28,582 --> 01:21:29,708
Colasanti.

1291
01:21:29,750 --> 01:21:31,217
Sit down.

1292
01:21:37,391 --> 01:21:38,858
What are you doing?

1293
01:21:38,892 --> 01:21:41,053
I'm taking the shot.

1294
01:21:41,095 --> 01:21:42,255
You got to be kidding me.

1295
01:21:42,296 --> 01:21:43,854
This better be good.

1296
01:21:47,267 --> 01:21:48,393
Don't blow it.

1297
01:21:51,271 --> 01:21:54,035
Come on, Gracie.

1298
01:21:55,642 --> 01:21:57,507
You can do this.

1299
01:22:14,595 --> 01:22:16,187
Wait till you're ready.

1300
01:22:18,165 --> 01:22:20,224
You can do anything.

1301
01:22:23,003 --> 01:22:24,231
I... I can't look.

1302
01:23:05,813 --> 01:23:07,542
Bowen, what are you doin'?

1303
01:23:07,581 --> 01:23:08,980
Get your head in the game.

1304
01:23:09,016 --> 01:23:10,210
You got corner.

1305
01:23:10,250 --> 01:23:11,945
You better be there.

1306
01:23:19,593 --> 01:23:21,288
Get back. Get back.

1307
01:23:21,328 --> 01:23:23,455
Let's get back!

1308
01:23:28,335 --> 01:23:29,893
Tighten up.

1309
01:23:44,051 --> 01:23:45,746
I told you to cover
the far post.

1310
01:23:45,786 --> 01:23:47,617
You don't want to do it,
you get off the field.

1311
01:23:47,654 --> 01:23:48,882
Give me the ball.

1312
01:23:48,922 --> 01:23:50,253
Bowen, what are you doin!?

1313
01:23:51,492 --> 01:23:52,925
You're playing forward.

1314
01:24:03,737 --> 01:24:07,298
Give me the ball.
Give me the ball.

1315
01:24:11,345 --> 01:24:13,313
Get rid of it, Bowen.
Get rid of it.

1316
01:24:19,286 --> 01:24:20,719
Oh!

1317
01:24:27,628 --> 01:24:29,391
Ref, that's a foul.

1318
01:24:42,609 --> 01:24:46,739
Come on, Bowen.
Get off the field.

1319
01:24:55,455 --> 01:24:57,946
Off the field.

1320
01:25:26,687 --> 01:25:29,087
Give me the ball.

1321
01:26:25,012 --> 01:26:27,776
Pass it. I'm open. Pass it.

1322
01:26:27,814 --> 01:26:29,304
Pass it! Pass it!

1323
01:26:43,297 --> 01:26:44,321
Finish it. Finish it.

1324
01:26:57,110 --> 01:26:58,338
Yeah!

1325
01:27:08,588 --> 01:27:10,681
She did it!

1326
01:27:10,724 --> 01:27:12,419
She did it!

1327
01:27:12,459 --> 01:27:15,257
She did it!

1328
01:27:40,487 --> 01:27:43,047
Yeah!

1329
01:28:09,583 --> 01:28:11,813
Gracie!

1330
01:28:16,189 --> 01:28:18,020
Dad!

1331
01:28:22,429 --> 01:28:24,920
Daddy!

1332
01:28:28,735 --> 01:28:30,965
Gracie!

1333
01:28:37,277 --> 01:28:38,403
Gracie!

1334
01:28:38,445 --> 01:28:40,242
Gracie! Gracie!

1335
01:28:40,280 --> 01:28:41,679
Gracie! Gracie!

1336
01:28:41,715 --> 01:28:43,410
Gracie! Gracie!

1337
01:28:43,450 --> 01:28:45,111
Gracie! Gracie!

1338
01:28:45,152 --> 01:28:46,744
Gracie! Gracie!

1339
01:28:46,787 --> 01:28:48,550
Gracie! Gracie!

1340
01:28:48,588 --> 01:28:50,317
Gracie!

1341
01:29:43,410 --> 01:29:47,141
# Well, I stood stone-like
at midnight #

1342
01:29:47,180 --> 01:29:50,741
# Suspended in my masquerade #

1343
01:29:50,784 --> 01:29:54,413
# And I combed my hair
till it was just right #

1344
01:29:54,454 --> 01:29:58,288
# And commanded
the night brigade #

1345
01:29:58,325 --> 01:30:02,318
# I was open to pain
and crossed by the rain #

1346
01:30:02,362 --> 01:30:04,990
# And I walked
on a crooked crutch #

1347
01:30:05,031 --> 01:30:09,092
# I strolled all alone
through a fallout zone #

1348
01:30:09,135 --> 01:30:13,265
# Came out
with my soul untouched #

1349
01:30:13,306 --> 01:30:16,400
# I hid in the clouded wrath
of the crowd #

1350
01:30:16,443 --> 01:30:20,539
# When they said, "Sit down,"
I stood up #

1351
01:30:20,580 --> 01:30:24,141
# Ooh #

1352
01:30:24,184 --> 01:30:29,121
# Growin' up #

1353
01:30:31,057 --> 01:30:34,390
# The flag of piracy
flew from my mast #

1354
01:30:34,427 --> 01:30:38,193
# My sails were set
wing to wing #

1355
01:30:38,231 --> 01:30:41,632
# I had a jukebox
graduate for first mate #

1356
01:30:41,668 --> 01:30:45,331
# She couldn't sail,
but she sure could sing #

1357
01:30:45,372 --> 01:30:49,240
# And I pushed b-52
and bombed them with the blues #

1358
01:30:49,276 --> 01:30:52,905
# With my gear set stubborn
on standing #

1359
01:30:52,946 --> 01:30:56,575
# I broke all the rules,
strafed my own high school #

1360
01:30:56,616 --> 01:31:00,279
# Never once gave thought
to landing #

1361
01:31:00,320 --> 01:31:03,187
# I hid in the clouded warmth
of the crowd #

1362
01:31:03,223 --> 01:31:07,785
# When they said, "Come down,"
I threw up #

1363
01:31:07,827 --> 01:31:11,388
# Ooh #

1364
01:31:11,431 --> 01:31:15,094
# Growin' up #

1365
01:31:15,135 --> 01:31:18,798
# Ooh #

1366
01:31:18,838 --> 01:31:22,103
# Growin' up #
