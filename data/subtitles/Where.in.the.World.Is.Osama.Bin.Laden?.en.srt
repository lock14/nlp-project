00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:22,937
And I got a tip where
to find his uncle, Mahfouz Azzam.

165
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:27,679
If he can tell me where the A-man is,
odds are Osama won't be too far away.

166
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,520
- Hello.
- Hello. Mahfouz? [speaks Arabic]

167
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:33,490
- It's nice to see you. Welcome.
- Nice to see you.

168
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:34,992
- Thank you.
- Please.

169
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:38,053
- It's a beautiful day today. Very nice.
- Yeah.

170
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:41,626
- [Morgan] So do you know where he is?
- [man in Arabic] No.

171
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,066
Where do you think he is?

172
00:11:43,135 --> 00:11:48,198
[in Arabic] If you learn where
he is, I beg you, let me know.

173
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:53,341
I just want to make sure he is OK.

174
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:59,146
He won't let me know by phone
because you kill people with the phone.

175
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:03,917
The Russians killed the president
of Chechnya with the phone,

176
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:10,421
and you Americans have killed
people with the phone.

177
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:15,661
This, a telephone,
has become a lethal weapon!

178
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,670
And every month my bank account
gets killed by my phone.

179
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:21,901
- [laughing]
- Which makes it even worse.

180
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:25,238
So, if you knew where he was,

181
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:27,836
you wouldn't turn him in
for the $25,000,000?

182
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,041
[laughs]

183
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:34,450
I would like to tell you something,

184
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,954
the hungry

185
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:41,015
who cannot find bread to eat

186
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,960
in Afghanistan

187
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:47,055
they wouldn't accept
these $25 million of yours

188
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:51,467
to turn in a Muslim they know
is waging jihad for them.

189
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:53,562
So he's in Afghanistan?

190
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,404
- You say so.
- You said so. You just told me.

191
00:12:57,476 --> 00:13:00,104
America says so. America says so.

192
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:02,875
- Do you think he's in Afghanistan?
- America says.

193
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:08,511
So if Al-Zawahiri and Osama bin Laden
just disappeared tomorrow,

194
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:10,054
would things change?

195
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:15,115
The seed that was sown by America,

196
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:18,493
a seed of spitefulness, hate,

197
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:21,328
aggression and killing,

198
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:26,337
cannot disappear in the short term.

199
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:32,969
There has to be another foreign
policy to uproot this seed.

200
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:36,446
[Morgan] It's easy to criticize
American foreign policy,

201
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:39,177
with the second most wanted
terrorist in the family.

202
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:42,277
I should find regular folks
who might be more objective.

203
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:44,845
What do you guys hear about Americans?

204
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:48,883
[in Arabic] The Americans
are known to be fighting

205
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:52,021
the Egyptians, Palestinians and lraqis.

206
00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:54,657
- We're fighting you?
- [laughing]

207
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:57,293
- Yes.
- Really? I didn't even know that.

208
00:13:57,369 --> 00:13:59,462
What are we fighting the Egyptians for?

209
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:01,802
[speaking Arabic]

210
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:04,633
You want to occupy Egypt.

211
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:05,972
[Morgan] Do we? Why?

212
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:08,878
We're not that well versed in politics

213
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:11,815
but that's what we hear on TV and stuff.

214
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:13,215
What do you think about America?

215
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:16,982
[in Arabic] They are good people, but
we reject the American foreign policy.

216
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:19,854
[Morgan] How can he be against
American foreign policy?

217
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:24,225
Egypt is one of our best friends in the
region and in the global war on terror.

218
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:28,528
At the same time, it was home to five
of the founding fathers of Al-Qaeda.

219
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:31,764
The guy who tried to blow up
the World Trade Center in '93,

220
00:14:31,837 --> 00:14:34,704
and the ringleader
of the 9/1 1 hijackings.

221
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:39,210
Maybe university students could tell me
why Osama's making so many friends here.

222
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:42,543
It's about oppression, because
Egypt is a developing country,

223
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:45,550
so, like, the people who are
oppressed are kind of more...

224
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:48,678
So it develops more terrorists,
and that's it.

225
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:54,090
[in Arabic] These would be
the minority, the rotten type.

226
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:55,990
Every society has the same.

227
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:58,256
Every society has good and bad.

228
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:01,561
In Egypt, people have no freedom.

229
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:06,264
And they try and prove to the government
that they have freedom, deserve freedom,

230
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:08,238
by committing terrorist attacks.

231
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:10,775
Did you vote in the last
presidential election?

232
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:12,743
- No.
- No.

233
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:15,371
- You weren't old enough yet?
- It's not that.

234
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:18,416
I don't believe in it.
I know it's rigged.

235
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:22,580
I know that Hosni Mubarak
would have won anyway.

236
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:26,421
They call this a democratic country,
but it's not.

237
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:30,019
In Egypt, if a president wants
to stay in power, he'll stay in power.

238
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:31,096
[applause]

239
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:34,860
[Morgan] And Hosni Mubarak has
been in power for more than 26 years.

240
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:40,934
The United States has got a close
and meaningful relationship with Egypt.

241
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:42,439
[cheering]

242
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:46,376
This relationship is a cornerstone
for our policy in the Middle East.

243
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:49,539
[Morgan] Policy that includes
giving Mubarak an aid package,

244
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,948
while looking the other way
as he uses riot police and hired thugs

245
00:15:53,018 --> 00:15:56,351
armed with sticks, knives,
swords and Molotov cocktails

246
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:59,152
to keep the opposition
from voting on election day.

247
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:03,888
You might say about Mubarak the same
thing FDR said about another dictator.

248
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:08,229
He may be a son of a bitch,
but he's our son of a bitch.

249
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,064
[Morgan] See, we've had a policy
of propping up dictators

250
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:14,401
for more than 50 years now.
When the Cold War started heating up,

251
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:18,000
we decided to do what it took
to stop communism from taking over.

252
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:21,569
And the United States started mixing
with a rougher crowd.

253
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,239
Hmm!

254
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:27,308
In 1 953, the CIA helped the Shah of
Iran overthrow the Iranian government,

255
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:29,286
to become their supreme ruler.

256
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:33,348
Sure, the Shah tortured or killed
anyone who publicly disagreed with him.

257
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:37,225
Even went as far as shoving broken glass
up the nether regions of critics.

258
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:39,696
But he totally hated Communism.

259
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:43,428
Now, he was a son of a bitch,
but he was our son of a bitch.

260
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:46,528
The Shah kept Iran
in our corner until 1 979,

261
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:49,972
when Ayatollah Khomeini's
Islamic revolution swept to power,

262
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:52,374
and held 52 Americans hostage
for 15 months.

263
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:55,743
That's when we made friends
with Saddam Hussein over in Iraq.

264
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:58,180
Now, he was an SOB too,
but for ten years,

265
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:01,777
while he was fighting the Iranians,
he was our SOB.

266
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:06,450
In fact, by the mid-'80s, we had sons of
bitches all the way from Latin America

267
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:10,427
to the Middle East, but, hey,
pimping freedom ain't easy.

268
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:13,488
[hip-hop music plays]

269
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:16,867
[Morgan] We needed to keep
our SOBs happy and on our side.

270
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:20,871
So we provided them with tanks,
guns, planes and more money.

271
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:24,670
Today we give Egypt more than 2 billion
dollars a year in weapons and aid.

272
00:17:24,743 --> 00:17:28,270
Sure, there's torture, murder
and rampant political corruption,

273
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:30,747
but somewhere along the way
we decided that,

274
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:32,784
in order to protect our own freedom,

275
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:35,649
it was all right to sacrifice
the freedom of others.

276
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:40,723
Does lack of democracy, human rights,
in countries like Egypt

277
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:44,729
encourage people to get involved
in extremist radical groups?

278
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:47,561
Of course. There's no doubt about this.

279
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:51,899
It's the one thing that
I agree with George W. Bush about.

280
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:54,268
That people join terrorist organizations

281
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:56,705
because there is
no other way to be active.

282
00:17:56,775 --> 00:18:01,474
The threat of terrorism created the
climate of fear that is being exploited

283
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:05,176
by the Mubarak regime
and by George Bush.

284
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,151
We're going through
a very difficult time now.

285
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,552
I mean, we have terrorists on one side,

286
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:15,389
and opportunist, exploitative regimes
on the other side.

287
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:17,895
The U.S. can no longer
claim the moral ground.

288
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:23,196
People have learned to expect a lot
less from the U.S. than they used to.

289
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:26,726
[Arabic music plays]

290
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:39,815
[man in Arabic] The United States is
the main problem in the region, frankly.

291
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:44,584
We love the American people, but
we hate the American government.

292
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:47,489
[in Arabic] We pray to God
to destroy you

293
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:50,722
because of what's happening.

294
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:54,459
[Morgan] America's filled with people
who want people to live peacefully,

295
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:56,296
to co-exist together, just like me.

296
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:59,633
OK, I don't want you to be there
when it happens.

297
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:01,138
Have a smell.

298
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:04,107
[Morgan] You know, being in the States,
all we get on the news

299
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:07,145
are the crazy nuts
that like to scream, "Death to you!"

300
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:09,373
And so you're like,
"Oh, man. Go get them."

301
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:12,682
But we've been in Egypt for a week now,

302
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:16,016
talking to people, who are real people,
just like you and me.

303
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:19,983
One after another after another
everybody said,

304
00:19:20,058 --> 00:19:23,755
"This government's corrupt
and it's backed by the U. S. "

305
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:28,528
- [chanting]
- It's hard for me to see how damaged

306
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:33,162
the image of the country that
I love and care about has become.

307
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:40,069
[phone rings]

308
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:43,842
- [Morgan] Hello?
- I got your postcard from Egypt today.

309
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:46,646
Oh, nice. You sound good.

310
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:51,178
I am good. Just promise you'll be here
when it's really important. OK?

311
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:52,985
I promise.

312
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:57,620
[woman] He has to be back by the
first week of November, because I'm due

313
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:00,426
the end of November, early December.

314
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:03,832
And, if he misses that,
I'm going to be so upset.

315
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:05,597
And he's going to be upset.

316
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:10,131
But, also, he's going to these places
that are so dangerous.

317
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:14,709
And I don't want him to miss anything.
And I don't want him to get hurt.

318
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:16,874
[man singing in Arabic]

319
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:20,350
[man in Arabic] While we are
living in these troubled times,

320
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:24,919
we need to be merciful.

321
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:28,926
So get mercy through praises
and prayers upon Him...

322
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:33,658
...because He is mercy.

323
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:37,691
And He puts compassion in your heart.

324
00:20:41,773 --> 00:20:45,573
As a Muslim I am taught
that God has honored humankind.

325
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:49,671
He did not say he honored Muslims and
everyone else is a second class citizen.

326
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:52,683
[speaking Arabic]
We have honored the children of heaven.

327
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:56,744
[singing in Arabic]

328
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:05,763
[man] Your average Egyptian's struggling
like your average American

329
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:06,923
to make ends meet,

330
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:10,196
to get a decent job, provide
for his family, educate his kids.

331
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,930
The same concerns all over.

332
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:17,232
[Morgan] Torek is an Egyptian-American
studying law at Al Azhar University.

333
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:20,005
He's a new dad and wants
the world's view of Islam

334
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:22,103
to change for the sake
of his young son.

335
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,807
[Torek] We need to rectify this,

336
00:21:23,882 --> 00:21:26,783
Muslims are over one fifth
of the world population.

337
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:31,050
That's a lot of people. It's not
some Polynesian island somewhere.

338
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,421
- [Morgan laughs]
- That's a lot of people!

339
00:21:33,492 --> 00:21:36,290
If four-fifths of the world
are scared of one-fifth,

340
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:39,330
what kind of civilization and humanity
are we gonna have?

341
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:42,799
- [laughing]
- [speaking Arabic]

342
00:21:47,939 --> 00:21:50,464
Now they're going to think
all we do is pray.

343
00:21:52,878 --> 00:21:55,403
- Even the kids!
- I'm working on the voice-over.

344
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:59,109
From a very young age,
they start manipulating the children.

345
00:21:59,184 --> 00:22:00,173
[laughing]

346
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:04,621
[Torek] We need to differentiate between
extreme factions in a population,

347
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:07,090
and the regular,
vast majority of people.

348
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,684
What do you think of the War on Terror?

349
00:22:09,761 --> 00:22:12,389
It's a bogus term.
I don't think it means anything.

350
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:13,829
I think some guy

351
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:17,596
that had too much to drink in the
Pentagon, one night, came up with that.

352
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:20,035
- Dude, I got a great idea.
- A war on terrorism.

353
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:22,596
We had a war on drugs.
We didn't win that, either.

354
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:25,472
[Torek] But is it really
a war on terror?

355
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:28,479
Have we eradicated terror?
Or are we exporting terror?

356
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:33,879
I think that... Unfortunately,
I think that we're exporting it.

357
00:22:33,952 --> 00:22:38,719
I think that we lit the flame on a bomb.

358
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:42,089
[Morgan] The bomb Torek is speaking of

359
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,253
is the explosive rise
in terrorist attacks

360
00:22:44,329 --> 00:22:45,887
during the last seven years.

361
00:22:45,964 --> 00:22:48,398
Al-Qaeda has now become
a global franchise,

362
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:52,164
serving up an unhealthy dose of j ihad
to more and more people each year.

363
00:22:52,237 --> 00:22:55,104
Ooh! Can I help you?

364
00:22:55,173 --> 00:22:59,576
[Morgan] Despite the U. S. spending over
$500 billion fighting the war on terror,

365
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:02,909
Al-Qaeda continues to find
new markets to expand into.

366
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:07,475
Thanks to heavy worldwide recruitment,
which included having interested people

367
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:12,251
filling out job applications,
AQ is now back to its pre-9/1 1 strength.

368
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:15,488
Two of the U. S. 's closest allies,
Spain and England,

369
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,120
were both attacked
by homegrown Al-Qaeda cells.

370
00:23:18,196 --> 00:23:21,893
Even Muslim countries are finding
they are in Al-Qaeda's crosshairs,

371
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:24,128
often becoming the victims of terrorism

372
00:23:24,202 --> 00:23:27,330
and feeling the influence
of Osama bin Laden firsthand.

373
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:29,397
[Arabic music plays]

374
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,521
[Morgan] Where is Osama bin Laden?

375
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:53,962
[in Arabic] He might be
somewhere here in Morocco.

376
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,601
[in Arabic] How should I know?

377
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,807
- Bin Laden? I am not a politic man.
- Yeah.

378
00:24:04,876 --> 00:24:08,243
I don't know nothing about...
I'm a carpet dealer. I sell carpet.

379
00:24:08,313 --> 00:24:10,474
[Morgan] How many years
has this tannery been here?

380
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:12,176
[in Arabic] Centuries.

381
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:15,583
What do you think about people
who cause violence in the name of lslam?

382
00:24:15,654 --> 00:24:20,648
[in Arabic] It is not from lslam
to kill innocent people

383
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:25,355
or to blow yourself up.

384
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:28,699
I'm disgusted by that.

385
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:32,100
[Morgan] Do you ever worry that your
sons may get involved with terrorists?

386
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:33,535
We worry about that.

387
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:37,939
We don't want them to get involved
with that kind of crowd.

388
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:42,105
That's why we have to take care
of them financially.

389
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:50,413
[man in Arabic] Americans are
causing all the trouble in the world.

390
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:51,581
But... Were the...

391
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:54,352
But this is my opinion
of the American government,

392
00:24:54,426 --> 00:24:55,757
not the American people.

393
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:58,455
[in Arabic] These are all
the problems that Bush created.

394
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:00,395
I heard that they want
to eradicate lslam.

395
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:07,636
[Morgan] What do you think
about Osama bin Laden?

396
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:09,697
[speaking Arabic]

397
00:25:09,774 --> 00:25:13,835
[Morgan laughs] He's crazy?

398
00:25:14,112 --> 00:25:16,103
[in Arabic] Osama bin Laden,
look how many people he's killed,

399
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:18,513
how many have died.
And what has he accomplished?

400
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:22,246
He's accomplished a wave
of suicide bombings in Morocco

401
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,585
killing more than 50 people
over the last four years.

402
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:27,818
The first attack was in May of 2003,

403
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:31,989
when recruiters outside the country came
to town and convinced 14 young men

404
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:36,090
to blow themselves up in exchange
for money and the rewards of paradise.

405
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:39,864
They all grew up on the exact same
street in the desperately poor ghetto

406
00:25:39,938 --> 00:25:42,133
of Sidi Moumen.

407
00:25:42,741 --> 00:25:44,470
I met journalist Aboubakr Jamai,

408
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:47,774
to find out what'd drive young men
to cause such destruction.

409
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:51,045
[Jamai] I think it's
a mix of ingredients.

410
00:25:51,116 --> 00:25:53,414
And, depending on the situation,

411
00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:56,750
one of the ingredients
is more important than the others.

412
00:25:56,821 --> 00:25:59,654
And, these ingredients,
I think in the case of Morocco,

413
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:02,784
the socio-economic ingredient
is the most important one.

414
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:08,299
It's not a coincidence that all
of the guys who blew themselves up

415
00:26:08,366 --> 00:26:13,497
in the 1 6th of May, uh, 2003,
came from this shantytown.

416
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:17,133
They were either unemployed
or had menial jobs.

417
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:20,769
And they were completely outcast
in their own society.

418
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:22,904
[Morgan] What do you think
is the solution?

419
00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:25,575
[Jamai] The problem in Morocco,
with the people here,

420
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:28,915
is that we fail to give them
an economic voice and a political voice.

421
00:26:28,987 --> 00:26:33,083
To me, that's the solution. Need to
give opportunity, economically speaking,

422
00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:35,922
because extremism
nourishes itself from darkness.

423
00:26:35,994 --> 00:26:38,622
[ Ernest Ranglin
and Baaba Maal: Haayo]

424
00:26:48,673 --> 00:26:51,904
[Morgan] That evening I was invited
to dinner with Ahmed and his family,

425
00:26:51,977 --> 00:26:54,411
in the same 200 square-foot house
he grew up in.

426
00:26:54,479 --> 00:26:58,973
Ahmed doesn't want his children to fall
prey to the same people the bombers did.

427
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:01,678
But with a poor education system
and little money,

428
00:27:01,753 --> 00:27:03,653
he fears they could be exploited.

429
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:06,782
Thank you for letting us come here.
This is a great thing.

430
00:27:06,858 --> 00:27:10,350
[in Arabic] lslam obligates us to be
this way, to be brothers with everyone.

431
00:27:10,428 --> 00:27:14,626
[Morgan] I'm about to have a baby in
December. Give me some fatherly advice.

432
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:18,931
You should take care of your wife.

433
00:27:19,004 --> 00:27:20,869
I've got a good wife, so that's good.

434
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:24,133
If your relationship is based
on love and good values,

435
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:26,939
you will have good children.

436
00:27:27,012 --> 00:27:28,274
[Morgan] Wow.

437
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,206
What kind of fish is that?

438
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:32,472
It's like a sardine.

439
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:33,574
It's delicious.

440
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,517
I'm glad. Eat with good health.

441
00:27:36,755 --> 00:27:40,191
So, I want you to tell me,
what do you hope for your kids?

442
00:27:40,258 --> 00:27:43,284
I want my kids to get an education.

443
00:27:43,361 --> 00:27:47,127
The people who aren't educated won't
accomplish anything in their life.

444
00:27:47,198 --> 00:27:48,460
How did you do in school?

445
00:27:48,533 --> 00:27:51,331
- [laughter]
- She's laughing!

446
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:59,671
She teases me. Sometimes
she and the kids gang up on me.

447
00:27:59,744 --> 00:28:01,871
So do I have that to look forward to?

448
00:28:01,946 --> 00:28:04,244
When you have your child
they will do the same to you.

449
00:28:06,051 --> 00:28:09,487
How hard is it to get
a good education living in this area?

450
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:12,523
You can't get well educated living here,

451
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,080
because of the poverty.

452
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,925
I'd like to hear your opinion. When we
hear about all these people who...

453
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:21,261
...commit acts of violence
in the name of lslam,

454
00:28:21,332 --> 00:28:24,233
what are your thoughts on those people?

455
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:27,827
Those people do not belong to lslam.

456
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:32,138
Even the terrorism that happened
here was masterminded abroad.

457
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:35,805
The people who blew themselves
up were tempted,

458
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,974
some tempted by money
and some by Paradise.

459
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:43,783
It is much harder for this generation
than it was for my generation.

460
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:59,869
[woman in French] Violence is birthed
by the economic dead ends

461
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:01,530
that confront our youth

462
00:29:01,606 --> 00:29:05,599
who happen to be Muslim
with an lslamic outlook.

463
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:10,512
How do you feel that we, as Americans,
or how do we as a world culture...

464
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,607
...start to end the fighting?

465
00:29:12,684 --> 00:29:17,018
I believe that there is an enormous
anger with American policy.

466
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:20,785
It's too bad it's the American people
who have to pay for that anger.

467
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:25,626
And so we have the obligation
not to fail our future,

468
00:29:25,697 --> 00:29:28,996
we have to reach out
to each other,

469
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:32,366
ignore official political lines

470
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:37,204
and create unofficial bridges
between civilian societies

471
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:38,572
in order to bring about change.

472
00:29:38,643 --> 00:29:42,670
What were your thoughts
after 9/1 1 happened?

473
00:29:42,881 --> 00:29:45,816
If it were truly
Osama bin Laden, who did that,

474
00:29:45,884 --> 00:29:47,715
then he dealt us a bad hand.

475
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:51,916
He legitimized the American
presence in the Middle East.

476
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:55,653
He was the reason for the adoption
of all the anti-terrorist laws

477
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:59,128
that have pushed us further
under the yoke

478
00:29:59,197 --> 00:30:02,166
of our own local political leaders.

479
00:30:02,233 --> 00:30:07,364
I was astonished on many levels.
It's horrible.

480
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:20,185
[beeping]

481
00:30:20,185 --> 00:30:22,847
[beeping]

482
00:30:28,593 --> 00:30:31,960
[Morgan] Osama bin Laden says one
reason for the creation of Al-Qaeda

483
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:35,022
and attacks against the West,
is the existence of Israel,

484
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:38,933
America's support of her and the
treatment of the Palestinian people.

485
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:41,471
If Osama cares
about the Palestinians so much,

486
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:44,167
I wanted to see if the feeling
was mutual. If it is,

487
00:30:44,242 --> 00:30:47,541
I'm sure someone
can help me narrow in on it.

488
00:30:47,612 --> 00:30:50,775
[Morgan] How do you feel about
Al-Qaeda causing acts of terrorism

489
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:54,182
- in the name of the Palestinian people?
- I don't agree with Al-Qaeda.

490
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:55,310
Yeah.

491
00:30:55,386 --> 00:30:57,911
I'll leave that alone.
I don't agree with them at all.

492
00:30:57,989 --> 00:31:01,186
It is none of their business
to do anything for us.

493
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:03,022
We can do for ourselves.

494
00:31:03,094 --> 00:31:07,690
We are fighting to make our homeland
free. It's none of their business.

495
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:13,728
[Morgan] I was wondering if you
could help? Looking for Osama bin Laden.

496
00:31:13,805 --> 00:31:16,171
- [man] Go to Tora Bora. No.
- Not here in Ramallah?

497
00:31:16,241 --> 00:31:18,232
- No?
- They hate Osama bin Laden.

498
00:31:18,309 --> 00:31:20,106
- Palestinians?
- Palestinians.

499
00:31:20,178 --> 00:31:22,442
- And you know, if...
- Why do they hate him?

500
00:31:23,348 --> 00:31:26,112
Because he likes blood. You know?

501
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:29,915
He is a ridiculous Muslim.
He gives a bad picture about lslam.

502
00:31:29,988 --> 00:31:32,980
[Arabic hip-hop plays]

503
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:43,594
We've heard Hamas is on the
same level as Al-Qaeda. Is that true?

504
00:31:43,668 --> 00:31:47,502
[in Arabic] Ours is
not a religious conflict.

505
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:51,565
We don't fight the Jews
because they are Jews.

506
00:31:51,643 --> 00:31:54,703
No, we fight them
because they occupy our lands.

507
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:58,875
And Al-Qaeda, it holds
all of the West as an enemy.

508
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:01,145
But the number one reason
they say they do it

509
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:05,087
is because of the Palestinian conflict.
Because of what's happening here.

510
00:32:05,156 --> 00:32:11,061
Any Arab leader, all Arab movements
have adopted the Palestinian issue

511
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:16,431
because they know the Palestinian issue
is what triggers the emotions and

512
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:19,197
nationalistic feelings
in all Arab and Muslim people.

513
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:23,138
But, at the same point, they're using
you guys as, like, this battle cry,

514
00:32:23,207 --> 00:32:27,143
but they're doing nothing to help you.
That's the reality.

515
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:28,972
Without the Palestinian issue,

516
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:33,711
they won't get any attention

517
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:37,118
on the global level.

518
00:32:37,188 --> 00:32:40,351
It is strategic on their part
to adopt the Palestinian issue.

519
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:57,804
[Morgan] Unbelievable how many
walls are here, the separation.

520
00:32:57,875 --> 00:33:00,901
Everywhere you go there's a wall,
a fence, barbed wire.

521
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:03,948
It's not for a human being.
It's good for a zoo.

522
00:33:04,182 --> 00:33:05,979
[in Arabic] If this
was happening in lsrael,

523
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:08,280
America and all the other
countries would protest it.

524
00:33:08,353 --> 00:33:10,878
- The peace of life, we don't have it.
- Yeah.

525
00:33:10,955 --> 00:33:14,789
And we are living in very big prison.

526
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:19,262
[in Arabic] I wish we had somebody
like Osama bin Laden in Palestine.

527
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:22,857
Just to destroy the state of lsrael.

528
00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:27,769
It's a political struggle, a military
struggle. But the biggest thing is this.

529
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,466
All of this is about land.

530
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:33,202
Scattered through the hills
of the Palestinian West Bank,

531
00:33:33,277 --> 00:33:37,304
are Israeli settlements, built to expand
the Jewish presence in the region.

532
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:40,515
How does it feel,
being overlooked by settlements?

533
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:44,544
It's not only overlooking us,
but we are always under their foot.

534
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:47,617
[in Arabic] They can come and take over
my home, where I live, by force.

535
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:51,184
What can I do? I can't do anything.

536
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:56,357
[man] Tears and blood were shed today
as Israel began the forced evacuation

537
00:33:56,434 --> 00:33:58,698
of Jewish settlers from their homes.

538
00:33:59,937 --> 00:34:02,269
[Morgan] The settlements
are a cause of violence

539
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,331
between settlers and Palestinians,

540
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:07,606
they are also a contentious issue
within Israeli politics.

541
00:34:07,678 --> 00:34:11,808
With one side seeing the settlements
as another obstacle in achieving peace,

542
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:14,477
while the other sees it
as a divine right.

543
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:17,919
We Jews are the rightful owner
of this land.

544
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:19,957
- Mm-hmm.
- It was a land that was promised

545
00:34:20,024 --> 00:34:24,324
to them by the Almighty, who kept
his promise and brought us back.

546
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:28,195
After we realized
there's going to be a struggle

547
00:34:28,266 --> 00:34:31,565
about every centimeter of the land,

548
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:35,003
we realized we have to
settle on the outposts

549
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:38,474
to enlarge the area.

550
00:34:38,543 --> 00:34:40,477
This outpost, for instance, it's...

551
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:43,673
- So is that legal to do that?
- It's illegal in the moment,

552
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:46,876
as it is in the process
of being legalized.

553
00:34:57,328 --> 00:34:59,592
[Morgan] What is your thought
on the Palestinian conflict?

554
00:34:59,664 --> 00:35:03,361
When we were kids, there was
this game where you play music

555
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:06,335
- and there's a circle of chairs.
- Yeah. Musical chairs.

556
00:35:06,404 --> 00:35:10,033
Musical chairs. This is a bit
like a musical chair tragedy.

557
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:12,440
Somebody is left without a chair.

558
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:15,104
But everybody needs to sit somewhere.

559
00:35:17,048 --> 00:35:19,346
[Morgan] Should lsraelis
move out of the settlements?

560
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:22,875
IsraeI'll have to let go
of the territories.

561
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:26,515
We are not holding the territories,
the territories are holding us.

562
00:35:27,091 --> 00:35:29,286
The tragedy of this place

563
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:33,854
is that everybody knows exactly
what would be the solution in the end,

564
00:35:33,931 --> 00:35:38,334
the end of the story. Two countries
that are connected, but separated.

565
00:35:38,402 --> 00:35:40,461
And this is the way it's going to end.

566
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:44,770
Every person in his right mind knows
this is the way it's going to end.

567
00:35:44,842 --> 00:35:47,902
One thing we don't know is
how many people are going to die,

568
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:51,210
and how much time is going to pass.
But the end is very clear.

569
00:35:51,282 --> 00:35:53,011
- Yeah.
- That's tragic.

570
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:55,951
Are there politicians
working towards a solution?

571
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:59,786
Yes, there are politicians
who are working for peace.

572
00:35:59,857 --> 00:36:04,521
The problem is, if you have
three buses exploding in Tel Aviv,

573
00:36:04,595 --> 00:36:06,028
- it will stop.
- Yeah.

574
00:36:06,097 --> 00:36:08,895
And we can progress
the peace process once again,

575
00:36:08,966 --> 00:36:13,994
and then if a settler in the territories

576
00:36:14,071 --> 00:36:16,198
will kill somebody, it will stop again.

577
00:36:16,274 --> 00:36:20,608
And so, we're being held hostage
by the extremists from both sides.

578
00:36:32,056 --> 00:36:35,822
So this is basically lsrael,
and that's the Gaza Strip.

579
00:36:35,893 --> 00:36:37,724
And...

580
00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:42,198
It's pretty... It's pretty scary.

581
00:36:42,767 --> 00:36:47,898
It is really scary. Imagine that rolling
up over your hill, coming at your house.

582
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:53,842
Imagine living like this. Imagine
this is how you live every single day.

583
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:55,902
[explosion]

584
00:36:58,316 --> 00:36:59,943
Oh, shit.

585
00:37:00,651 --> 00:37:05,088
[woman] A Qassam touched down next to
a daycare center in Sderot this morning.

586
00:37:05,156 --> 00:37:06,817
No one was wounded in the attack,

587
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:11,555
but the Hamas chief warned the
rocket attacks on Israel will continue.

588
00:37:24,008 --> 00:37:27,842
[Morgan] So this classroom was blown up
about eight and a half hours ago.

589
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:32,042
Luckily, there were no kids in it.
Rocket came from the Gaza Strip.

590
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:35,947
If there had been kids in here,
half of them would be dead.

591
00:37:37,054 --> 00:37:39,784
You see this and get a sense
of how wrong things are.

592
00:37:39,857 --> 00:37:42,690
I can't imagine raising my kid
up in a place like this.

593
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:46,093
I couldn't imagine living in a place
where my kid went to school,

594
00:37:46,163 --> 00:37:48,631
and this is something
that can happen every day.

595
00:37:54,305 --> 00:37:58,105
[woman] I think everything's going
pretty good with the pregnancy.

596
00:37:58,175 --> 00:38:01,076
Thirty weeks, it's very active,

597
00:38:01,145 --> 00:38:06,276
and it's positioned the right way,
and everything's good.

598
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:08,875
Take deep, full breaths into the belly.

599
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:11,854
I never imagined I would
spend my pregnancy like this,

600
00:38:11,922 --> 00:38:14,948
separated from my partner,
but, then again,

601
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:19,690
before Morgan, I never thought
I would have kids, so... [laughs]

602
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:22,324
You just never can tell, can you?

603
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:26,369
[siren wails]

604
00:38:26,437 --> 00:38:29,429
Here with the lsraeli Police
Bomb Squad, they got a call.

605
00:38:29,507 --> 00:38:31,998
Two calls, actually.
Going to check them out.

606
00:38:32,076 --> 00:38:34,044
[siren wails]

607
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:40,248
- Is it right here?
- Yeah. Right, few feet of us.

608
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,785
Let's go!

609
00:38:41,852 --> 00:38:45,117
[in Hebrew] The suspicious object
is here, past the garbage can.

610
00:38:45,189 --> 00:38:47,248
[man in Hebrew] Listen up.
Good evening to everyone.

611
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:48,986
There is
a suspicious object there.

612
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:52,359
I am asking everyone
who is in this area of Allenby

613
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:55,092
and the area of the boardwalk
to move away from the area.

614
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:06,634
The man on the hotel balcony,
get inside.

615
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:13,409
Everyone is requested to be
behind the police gates.

616
00:39:14,552 --> 00:39:17,453
Pay attention. This is the bomb squad.

617
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:20,251
I am about to conduct a controlled
explosion on the suspicious object.

618
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:24,624
[Morgan] It's so scary.
And this happens every day.

619
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:27,425
Eight to ten times a day,
he said, sometimes up to 1 8.

620
00:39:27,498 --> 00:39:30,524
Don't stand near the windows.

621
00:39:46,951 --> 00:39:51,217
[man] Three... two... one. Go.

622
00:39:57,128 --> 00:39:59,028
There's a bikini inside.

623
00:39:59,096 --> 00:40:01,257
[laughs] Check it out.

624
00:40:04,702 --> 00:40:07,933
Well, my heart's pounding
and it's a bikini. [laughs]

625
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:14,904
Nice job, pal. You did good.

626
00:40:15,045 --> 00:40:17,104
- [beeps]
- Good job, buddy.

627
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:20,975
No, come on.
Don't be so hard on yourself.

628
00:40:21,051 --> 00:40:24,509
- [beeping]
- There'll be plenty more chances.

629
00:40:35,966 --> 00:40:38,628
- [Morgan] Can we ask you questions?
- [man] About what?

630
00:40:38,702 --> 00:40:40,363
- About....
- Political?

631
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:42,269
- A little bit. [laughs]
- No, no.

632
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:47,767
I'd love to hear your thoughts on the
current conflict. It's all an illusion?

633
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:49,005
Yes.

634
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:53,379
Wow. That guy is one of the
greatest optimists I've ever seen.

635
00:40:54,652 --> 00:40:57,212
How you doing?
Can I ask you a couple of questions?

636
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:59,119
[splashing]

637
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:01,158
So somebody just threw
a water balloon at us.

638
00:41:01,225 --> 00:41:03,056
[man in Hebrew]
Get the hell out of here!

639
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:06,324
And now there's
a crowd gathering because

640
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:09,833
they're going to chase us away.
They're gathering numbers now.

641
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,801
There's a big flock of people
that's going to chase us.

642
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:14,667
- Go off!
- [man in Hebrew] Get out of here!

643
00:41:14,738 --> 00:41:15,727
This is not your land.

644
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:18,070
I'm not allowed to talk
to anybody in the country?

645
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:20,633
[man in Hebrew]
Get the hell out of here!

646
00:41:20,711 --> 00:41:23,612
- I'd say...
- Get out of here!

647
00:41:23,681 --> 00:41:26,115
...we're not very wanted around here.

648
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,785
[in Hebrew] I'm going to break this.

649
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:39,953
This place is no joke. We were down
there just trying to talk to people.

650
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:45,263
So what you see here, majority
of people here don't think like them.

651
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:49,329
Yeah, I think we've found
enough peace here today.

652
00:41:49,406 --> 00:41:52,933
Out of here, get out of here,
get out of here!

653
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:55,444
It is... It's no joke.

654
00:41:55,813 --> 00:41:58,008
Go off! Go off!

655
00:41:58,082 --> 00:42:00,414
- I'm going to my car.
- Go off!

656
00:42:02,486 --> 00:42:03,851
Dude.

657
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:05,980
- Yeah.
- Jewish?

658
00:42:06,056 --> 00:42:08,251
I'm going to my car.

659
00:42:08,325 --> 00:42:11,692
- No Jewish.
- [shouting]

660
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:16,261
There's so many things
that are wrong on both sides.

661
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:20,869
If this was solved tomorrow,
if, suddenly, there were two states,

662
00:42:20,938 --> 00:42:24,374
and people were living in peace,
would bin Laden go away?

663
00:42:24,441 --> 00:42:26,033
I don't think it would happen.

664
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:29,011
What you're doing,
is you're taking an argument away.

665
00:42:29,413 --> 00:42:31,677
It isn't. It's messed up.

666
00:42:31,916 --> 00:42:33,213
[shouting]

667
00:42:33,284 --> 00:42:36,845
There goes my friend. See you.

668
00:42:55,205 --> 00:42:58,470
[Morgan] How hard is it for you
to be in the minority in this region,

669
00:42:58,542 --> 00:43:00,271
a Christian in a Muslim country?

670
00:43:00,344 --> 00:43:05,247
I have no problem whatsoever,
living with the Muslims.

671
00:43:05,316 --> 00:43:06,806
We are worshipping Allah.

672
00:43:07,518 --> 00:43:12,080
And, uh, I am worshipping the same God,

673
00:43:12,156 --> 00:43:16,991
that the Christians and the Muslims
and the Jews are worshipping.

674
00:43:17,061 --> 00:43:18,619
The one God.

675
00:43:18,696 --> 00:43:24,635
Religion is being used as a mask
to hide the cruelty...

676
00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:28,600
...the ugliness of violence.

677
00:43:28,672 --> 00:43:34,508
Moderates, they are the majority,
but their voices are not loud enough.

678
00:43:34,578 --> 00:43:37,479
[Morgan] What are your thoughts
on the global war on terror?

679
00:43:37,548 --> 00:43:41,644
9/1 1 breaks the hearts
of every human being,

680
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:45,553
but I think the best way
is not to fight only.

681
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:50,322
You have to look for
the root of the problem.

682
00:43:50,394 --> 00:43:55,764
What our American brothers
and friends need is a cultural strategy.

683
00:43:56,867 --> 00:44:01,270
Without understanding each other,
without this mutual respect,

684
00:44:01,338 --> 00:44:04,171
there's no peace. It's impossible.

685
00:44:04,775 --> 00:44:07,369
Mission is impossible.

686
00:44:08,746 --> 00:44:12,182
[Morgan] Not only is it impossible,
it's downright scary.

687
00:44:12,249 --> 00:44:14,274
Just ask journalist Fouad Hussein.

688
00:44:14,351 --> 00:44:18,412
Ten years ago while he was jailed for
criticizing Jordan's economic policies,

689
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:22,084
he met Abu Musab al-Zarqawi,
leader of Al-Qaeda in Iraq.

690
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:26,027
They remained pen pals
up until Zarqawi was killed in 2006.

691
00:44:26,096 --> 00:44:28,121
According to what Zarqawi told him,

692
00:44:28,198 --> 00:44:30,996
America is playing
right into Al-Qaeda's hands.

693
00:44:31,235 --> 00:44:35,672
[in Arabic] Al-Qaeda attacked New York
and Washington on September 1 1th.

694
00:44:35,739 --> 00:44:40,972
Because Al-Qaeda can't fight the U.S. on
its soil, they drew them to Arabic land

695
00:44:41,045 --> 00:44:42,945
so that they will fight them here.

696
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:45,709
[Morgan] Had we left Afghanistan
and said "That's it."

697
00:44:45,783 --> 00:44:48,809
You know, "We're done."
What would have happened?

698
00:44:48,886 --> 00:44:54,483
After Afghanistan, Al-Qaeda
didn't have anywhere to operate.

699
00:44:54,558 --> 00:44:56,048
If the United States
hadn't entered lraq,

700
00:44:56,126 --> 00:44:58,993
Al-Qaeda wouldn't be
the same as they are now.

701
00:44:59,063 --> 00:45:01,258
It would have ended
by the end of Afghanistan.

702
00:45:01,331 --> 00:45:03,561
The psychology of the Arabs and Muslims

703
00:45:03,634 --> 00:45:06,432
is to side
with whoever fights the occupier.

704
00:45:08,572 --> 00:45:11,473
If bin Laden would be
caught or killed right now,

705
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:13,737
- would it make any difference?
- Nothing.

706
00:45:13,811 --> 00:45:15,142
Nothing whatsoever.

707
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:18,477
Zarqawi was killed
and nothing happened.

708
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:21,814
And if bin Laden and Zawahiri
got killed, nothing will happen.

709
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:25,412
Because Al-Qaeda has become
an intercontinental idea,

710
00:45:25,489 --> 00:45:27,719
the same as globalization.

711
00:45:29,426 --> 00:45:32,520
[Morgan] And that idea is reaching
more and more people each day.

712
00:45:32,596 --> 00:45:35,531
With Operation Special Delivery
only seven weeks away,

713
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:37,328
I need to go back to the beginning.

714
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:40,564
And the beginning for Osama
is Saudi Arabia.

715
00:45:41,638 --> 00:45:43,970
Saudi Arabia is a country
ruled by one family,

716
00:45:44,041 --> 00:45:48,444
and governed by one brand
of fundamental Islam, Wahhabism.

717
00:45:48,512 --> 00:45:51,345
Osama was born here.
He went to school here.

718
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:54,543
And, in the late '70s,
he was radicalized here.

719
00:45:54,985 --> 00:45:58,944
[man in Arabic] O God, one leader
to lead jihad for your sake.

720
00:45:59,022 --> 00:46:01,047
To liberate the land of Palestine.

721
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:03,059
And the land of lraq
from the Christians.

722
00:46:03,127 --> 00:46:04,560
O God, the strong and noble one.

723
00:46:04,628 --> 00:46:07,028
O God, go after the Christians.

724
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:09,088
O God, make wars in their homes.

725
00:46:09,166 --> 00:46:11,760
O God, release your armies upon them.

726
00:46:11,835 --> 00:46:15,066
O God, make the land of Palestine
a graveyard for the Jews.

727
00:46:15,139 --> 00:46:18,802
O God, make the land of lraq
a graveyard for the Christians.

728
00:46:18,876 --> 00:46:21,401
[Morgan] Do you feel America
is trying to fight a war

729
00:46:21,478 --> 00:46:23,002
against the religion of lslam?

730
00:46:25,315 --> 00:46:28,250
[in Arabic] Well, look at what
you did in lraq and Afghanistan.

731
00:46:28,585 --> 00:46:31,884
Well, they went to Afghanistan
to get Osama bin Laden.

732
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:34,287
And the Taliban wouldn't give him up.

733
00:46:34,358 --> 00:46:36,451
Was it an act of aggression or not?

734
00:46:36,527 --> 00:46:38,586
We were seeking peace in Afghanistan.

735
00:46:38,662 --> 00:46:41,324
You went there with an ambulance
or with a tank?

736
00:46:41,398 --> 00:46:43,229
[laughter]

737
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:46,792
That's a good question. Do you think
Osama bin Laden caused 9/1 1?

738
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:51,432
If one man in a cave
was able to do this...

739
00:46:51,508 --> 00:46:53,999
What if all Muslims were
to resist against America

740
00:46:54,077 --> 00:46:55,840
under the leadership of one man?

741
00:46:55,913 --> 00:46:59,644
See, but I don't think 1.2 billion
Muslims think the same way you think.

742
00:46:59,716 --> 00:47:02,241
One single verse from the Koran
and they will come.

743
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:04,480
So why has no one said that verse yet?

744
00:47:04,555 --> 00:47:07,023
These things get planned.
Don't disregard it as unlikely.

745
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:10,992
What if we were to burn the refineries,
just to deprive you of the oil?

746
00:47:17,935 --> 00:47:20,563
[Morgan] You said Saudi Arabia
is a country divided.

747
00:47:20,637 --> 00:47:21,865
What do you mean by that?

748
00:47:21,939 --> 00:47:27,502
Not divided, but not yet building
the national unity we are looking for.

749
00:47:27,578 --> 00:47:31,241
One important issue in the Kingdom,
is to organize the relation between

750
00:47:31,315 --> 00:47:34,773
the religious establishment
and the political establishment.

751
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:38,185
This issue hasn't been resolved yet,
and it must be resolved.

752
00:47:38,255 --> 00:47:43,659
Otherwise, extremists, terrorists, may
dictate some of their ideologies on us.

753
00:47:43,727 --> 00:47:47,754
And we still have so many people,
who are refusing to accept the reality.

754
00:47:47,831 --> 00:47:50,197
Are there still radicals
within the country?

755
00:47:50,267 --> 00:47:53,794
We still have a lot.
And they are dangerous, by the way.

756
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:58,205
We should not underestimate
the ability of the extremists.

757
00:47:58,275 --> 00:48:02,143
Those people are ready to die.
Those people are ready to destroy.

758
00:48:02,646 --> 00:48:06,047
Those people are ready
to kill themselves, kill their families,

759
00:48:06,116 --> 00:48:08,482
they don't care about life.

760
00:48:09,019 --> 00:48:12,113
Therefore, I think they are
a threat us, in Saudi Arabia,

761
00:48:12,189 --> 00:48:14,714
then to other countries,
then to the world.

762
00:48:15,759 --> 00:48:18,660
[man] In an unprecedented
nine month operation

763
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:22,221
netting more than
170 Al-Qaeda suspects,

764
00:48:22,299 --> 00:48:24,233
and more than five million dollars,

765
00:48:24,301 --> 00:48:27,293
Saudi intelligence officials
say they thwarted plans

766
00:48:27,371 --> 00:48:31,705
to fly aircraft into oil facilities,
attack security installations,

767
00:48:31,775 --> 00:48:36,337
kill senior officials
and send money to Al-Qaeda in Iraq.

768
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:40,372
But the raids reveal a far more
worrying trend for the Saudis.

769
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:44,477
The war in Iraq is spilling over
into Saudi Arabia.

770
00:48:49,826 --> 00:48:53,660
Right in front of the head office
of the Mutawwa'un, the religious police,

771
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:56,563
is Chop Chop Square.
I'm standing right on the drain

772
00:48:56,633 --> 00:48:58,430
where they...
[makes slicing noises]

773
00:48:58,502 --> 00:49:01,835
...cut people's heads off,
and the blood goes into that drain.

774
00:49:01,905 --> 00:49:04,373
Everybody stands around and watches.

775
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:06,636
They kill people
in the morning and then

776
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:09,736
play soccer in the afternoons.

777
00:49:09,813 --> 00:49:11,246
What a place.

778
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:16,279
[Morgan] It's complete culture shock
for me to be in Saudi Arabia.

779
00:49:16,353 --> 00:49:19,789
An absolute other world,
from anything I've ever experienced,

780
00:49:19,856 --> 00:49:21,153
any place I've ever been.

781
00:49:21,224 --> 00:49:26,389
We've been to Egypt and Morocco and
Jordan, and the Palestinian territories,

782
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:30,331
and these places are
so progressive by comparison.

783
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,595
There is no separation
of church and state.

784
00:49:32,669 --> 00:49:34,933
Church is the state,
state is the church.

785
00:49:35,005 --> 00:49:38,133
The religion and the ideology
is what runs everything.

786
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:43,002
Boys and girls separated
from the time they're ten.

787
00:49:44,581 --> 00:49:47,141
You can't see La Perla's brassiere ad.

788
00:49:47,217 --> 00:49:51,085
That's wrong. Oh, you can't
see Posh Spice's shoulder.

789
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:53,349
You can't see the knee or the thigh.

790
00:49:53,423 --> 00:49:56,017
- Can't I police my own thoughts?
- No.

791
00:49:56,093 --> 00:49:59,153
[Morgan] That's the problem
when a country's built entirely on

792
00:49:59,229 --> 00:50:02,756
marriage between church and state.
There isn't much room for moderates.

793
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:05,427
There's no freedom of speech
or freedom of the press,

794
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:09,131
speaking or writing anything
critical of the royal family is illegal.

795
00:50:09,206 --> 00:50:11,572
Public protest is actually forbidden.

796
00:50:11,641 --> 00:50:15,372
The Ministry of Information monitors
the Web for any immoral content,

797
00:50:15,445 --> 00:50:19,313
but websites supporting Al-Qaeda
seem to get through just fine.

798
00:50:19,383 --> 00:50:21,851
[Morgan] What do fundamentalists
hope to achieve?

799
00:50:21,918 --> 00:50:24,978
Power in the name of God.
That's where I don't like it.

800
00:50:25,055 --> 00:50:27,319
They manipulate the lslamic teachings

801
00:50:27,391 --> 00:50:30,326
to fit different situations,
different conditions,

802
00:50:30,394 --> 00:50:32,760
- to, ultimately, lead them to power.
- Yeah.

803
00:50:32,829 --> 00:50:37,266
I don't think a religious person,
be it Christian, Jewish or Muslim,

804
00:50:37,334 --> 00:50:42,237
by his own upbringing and teaching,
is qualified to be a public official.

805
00:50:42,305 --> 00:50:47,743
He's just not. Politics is
completely different from religion.

806
00:50:48,512 --> 00:50:52,380
I don't think any religious person
is qualified to be a public official.

807
00:50:52,449 --> 00:50:58,445
A good amount of secularism in every
Arab political system is badly needed.

808
00:50:58,522 --> 00:51:02,151
Drawing clear lines
between where an lmam,

809
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:04,853
a priest role, a responsibility ends,

810
00:51:04,928 --> 00:51:08,830
and a politician, or a
public official's responsibility begins.

811
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:10,628
We need it for stability.

812
00:51:11,535 --> 00:51:14,834
I'd love to hear your thoughts
on Osama bin Laden.

813
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:18,033
Osama bin Laden, per se,
is not the problem.

814
00:51:18,108 --> 00:51:20,235
The school of thought, the followers,

815
00:51:20,310 --> 00:51:24,110

in lslamic countries,

816
00:51:24,181 --> 00:51:25,614
in the Muslim world,

817
00:51:25,682 --> 00:51:28,879
is where the restructuring
and the fight should begin.

818
00:51:28,952 --> 00:51:32,820
It's unfortunate, but he is a product
of the system, the establishment.

819
00:51:32,889 --> 00:51:36,052
There's no denying that.
We have to accept that.

820
00:51:36,126 --> 00:51:39,721
[Morgan] I went to a school to find what
kids are being taught about the west.

[ Jon Spurney: School Days]

822

open-minded, free-thinking students,

00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:51,729

are the two I'm allowed to speak to.

principal be present the whole time.

[Morgan] How old are you guys?

826
00:51:57,481 --> 00:51:58,539
[man in Arabic] Eighteen.

827
00:51:58,615 --> 00:51:59,912
Eighteen, yeah.

828
00:51:59,983 --> 00:52:03,111
So how is it being 1 8 in Saudi Arabia?

829
00:52:03,186 --> 00:52:05,586
[in Arabic] Great.

830
00:52:05,655 --> 00:52:08,886
We have no worries or troubles.

831
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:12,554
What did you learn about the
United States while you were in school?

832
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:15,765
Actually, we did not study

833
00:52:15,832 --> 00:52:19,632
the United States specifically.

834
00:52:19,703 --> 00:52:23,662
What's your opinion
of the United States?

835
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:29,571
I have no definite opinion...
no specific opinion.

836
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:32,114
I'm just curious
what you think about the U.S.

837
00:52:32,182 --> 00:52:36,915
In the United States we hear
one idea about Muslim countries,

838
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:40,388
Saudi Arabia is where
the hijackers came from.

839
00:52:40,457 --> 00:52:43,824
Saudi Arabia is the country
that...

840
00:52:43,894 --> 00:52:45,862
...makes a lot of money off of oil.

841
00:52:45,929 --> 00:52:49,421
So I'm curious what you guys
hear about the United States.

842
00:52:50,267 --> 00:52:51,291
No answer.

843
00:52:51,368 --> 00:52:53,666
You have no answer? No? How about you?

844
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:58,335
Their view is...

845
00:52:58,408 --> 00:53:04,404
Americans always want to dominate...

846
00:53:05,715 --> 00:53:10,345
No, that was the wrong answer...

847
00:53:12,889 --> 00:53:17,189
One of the things we hear a lot
in the United States,

848
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:22,027
is that there's a lot of anti-Western,
or anti-Semitic things taught in school.

849
00:53:22,098 --> 00:53:24,589
What are you taught about lsrael?

- They want to stop.

852
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:32,140
- They want to stop the whole thing?
- Yes.

853
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:33,870
OK. [laughs]

How are you to have a discussion,
if he can't talk about things?

855
00:53:43,353 --> 00:53:46,516
How are things supposed to change
if you can't address them?

Could I ask you guys a question? No?

860
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:30,866
Do you know anybody who could
get me in touch with Osama bin Laden?

861
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:34,131
Osama bin Laden?
[in Arabic] No, I have no leads.

862
00:54:35,805 --> 00:54:39,639
It's becoming more obvious,
Osama never went to the mall.

- [woman] Yeah.

- Yeah.

- Where can I find Osama bin Laden?
- What?

- Yes.

- Was he down past the Nutella?

Is he in Saudi Arabia?

00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:05,595
- Maybe.
- Maybe. OK.

871
00:55:05,669 --> 00:55:08,365
Maybe you can ask his family.
Maybe they can help you.

- Yeah.

- Cool, I'll do that. Thanks. Bye.
- OK. Bye.

number if your last name was bin Laden?

the very first thing I would have done.

Hopefully, he could point me
in the right direction.

was said to be one of the hijackers.

- [in Arabic] Yes.
- Yeah. Was he?

921
00:58:18,761 --> 00:58:20,422
No.

922
00:58:21,598 --> 00:58:24,692
After 9/1 1, there was video

923
00:58:24,767 --> 00:58:28,863
of a lot of the hijackers.
A lot of them released video statements.

924
00:58:28,938 --> 00:58:33,568
Do you not think that connects them
in some way to what happened?

925
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:38,511
I don't believe that is solid proof.

and technologies in the world.

the lion, the dog and the pig,

928
00:58:46,422 --> 00:58:49,585
we've seen them in many movies
talking like humans.

929
00:58:50,293 --> 00:58:53,820
I feel very uncomfortable
with this conversation.

930
00:58:53,897 --> 00:58:57,697
What do you think
would drive some people

931
00:58:57,767 --> 00:59:00,327
towards wanting to join
a group like Al-Qaeda?

932
00:59:00,403 --> 00:59:04,703
What would make them want to go off
and fight, possibly lose their lives?

933
00:59:04,807 --> 00:59:09,267
They go because they feel
like America...

934
00:59:09,345 --> 00:59:11,506

00:59:11,581 --> 00:59:13,742

of ways to dominate

936
00:59:13,816 --> 00:59:16,148

on the entire world,

937
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:18,210
especially on the Muslim world.

938

Have you had friends who
have gone off to wage jihad?

939
00:59:22,425 --> 00:59:23,983
Yes, of course.

940
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:25,352
Where did they go?

941
00:59:25,428 --> 00:59:29,057
These youth went first to Afghanistan.

942
00:59:29,132 --> 00:59:33,034
Then America went into lraq,
and they followed.

943
00:59:33,102 --> 00:59:35,002
How many people do you know that went?

944
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:37,164
- A lot.
- [man] A lot.

945
00:59:38,808 --> 00:59:41,072
And how many have come back?

946
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:45,309
Unfortunately, nobody came back.

947
00:59:46,783 --> 00:59:48,751

948
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:04,533
[Morgan] Afghanistan is a country at war
for more than 30 years,

949
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:05,727
and it feels like it.

950
01:00:12,208 --> 01:00:15,541
From when the Soviet Union invaded,
to civil war, to the Taliban,

951
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:18,046
and now the arrival
of U. S. and NATO forces,

952
01:00:18,114 --> 01:00:20,105
its impact is everywhere.

953
01:00:20,183 --> 01:00:23,778
Wherever you go there's barricades,
barbed wire, people with guns,

954
01:00:23,853 --> 01:00:25,844
checkpoints, more people with guns.

955
01:00:28,658 --> 01:00:32,219
And, in the middle of all this,
is just this incredible poverty.

956
01:00:34,597 --> 01:00:37,657
I thought the first place to look
in Afghanistan for Osama

957
01:00:37,734 --> 01:00:41,602
was the last place that he was seen.
So we're heading out to Tora Bora.

need to worry about it at all."

in this area?

No, not on the path...

964
01:01:16,072 --> 01:01:17,972
- Really?
- Really.

965
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:19,664
OK.

966
01:01:22,645 --> 01:01:26,342
[Morgan] So, this area here, this
was the beginning of Al-Qaeda's base?

967
01:01:26,416 --> 01:01:30,978
[man in Arabic] This is where
Osama's headquarters was.

968
01:01:31,054 --> 01:01:33,887
There are large caves on this
side and the other side too.

969
01:01:33,956 --> 01:01:39,826
They were full of ammunition, weapons,
and food such as tea, sugar and rice.

970
01:01:39,896 --> 01:01:42,524
Look, up there, should we go?

971
01:01:42,932 --> 01:01:45,696
One of our soldiers
is shaking the nuts off the tree,

972
01:01:45,768 --> 01:01:48,703
'cause, apparently,,
if you eat 20 of these nuts...

973
01:01:49,672 --> 01:01:51,731
All night long.

01:01:51,808 --> 01:01:55,107
It's the word on the street.
You can rock and roll all night.

975
01:01:56,079 --> 01:02:00,106
Look at that, we got a guy
up in the tree to get the magic nuts.

976
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:03,115
Dude, look at that.

977
01:02:03,186 --> 01:02:07,213
While these guys are playing with their
nuts, I think I'll head out on my own.

978
01:02:27,376 --> 01:02:31,403
President Bush said that he wanted to
capture Osama bin Laden dead or alive.

979
01:02:31,481 --> 01:02:34,575
The U. S. had its best chance
in late November of 2001,

980
01:02:34,650 --> 01:02:37,175
when elements of both
Afghan and American forces

981
01:02:37,253 --> 01:02:39,778
closed in on Osama's mountain hideout.

982
01:02:39,856 --> 01:02:43,587
The following days saw some of the
heaviest fighting in all of the war.

983
01:02:43,659 --> 01:02:47,390
Yoo-hoo! Osama!

984
01:02:47,463 --> 01:02:50,296
And, rather than commit
additional U. S. ground forces,

985
01:02:50,366 --> 01:02:53,927
the U. S. chose to rely on local
Afghan fighters to bring in OBL.

986
01:02:54,003 --> 01:02:56,995
When the dust had settled,
Osama was gone.

987
01:02:57,073 --> 01:03:00,770
The governor of the province has
ideas how to bring the excitement back.

988
01:03:00,843 --> 01:03:03,903
[in foreign language] Our plan
and goal is that Tora Bora

989
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:06,710
should become an international
tourism center.

990
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:10,742
So we want to build a grand
amusement park in Tora Bora.

991
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:11,878
What kind of rides?

992
01:03:11,988 --> 01:03:12,977
Everything will be built.

993
01:03:13,055 --> 01:03:14,044
Maybe a roller coaster.

994
01:03:14,123 --> 01:03:15,112
Everything will be built.

995
01:03:15,191 --> 01:03:16,954
- Water slides?
- Absolutely.

996
01:03:17,026 --> 01:03:20,086
- Ferris wheels? All of it?
- Yes. Yes.

997
01:03:20,163 --> 01:03:22,597
You could say,
"Tora Bora. It's the bomb."

998
01:03:22,665 --> 01:03:25,896
[crickets chirping]

999
01:03:25,968 --> 01:03:28,960
[Morgan] I'm not sure how much fun
Afghanistan is ready for.

1000
01:03:30,506 --> 01:03:34,499
Seems to me they could use a lot more
than just roller coasters around here.

1001
01:03:38,748 --> 01:03:42,081
[in foreign language] No one
has done anything for us.

1002
01:03:42,151 --> 01:03:45,951
All the international aid
goes to those at the top.

1003
01:03:46,022 --> 01:03:47,011
It never makes its way down to us.

1004
01:03:47,089 --> 01:03:48,886
You got a tent from the UN.

1005
01:03:49,425 --> 01:03:50,653
No, we bought it
in the black market!

1006
01:03:50,726 --> 01:03:54,162
- No, we buy it in the black market.
- [laughing]

1007
01:03:55,231 --> 01:03:59,497
They haven't helped us with land,
money or to fix our tent or anything.

1008
01:04:01,204 --> 01:04:04,264
Look at this troublemaker!
When we're traveling at night,

1009
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:08,504
we have to constantly check the camel to
make sure we didn't leave him somewhere.

1010
01:04:08,578 --> 01:04:09,875
Have you left him behind before?

1011
01:04:09,946 --> 01:04:12,847
Yeah, all the time!

1012
01:04:12,915 --> 01:04:14,439
We've lost them many times!

1013
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:17,452
Our lives already passed. We are
concerned about our children.

1014
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:20,318
They should be able
to have a better life.

1015
01:04:22,825 --> 01:04:24,554
[man] The international community

1016
01:04:24,627 --> 01:04:27,061
is failing to help this country
get on its feet.

1017
01:04:27,129 --> 01:04:31,657
Organizations such as USA gauge success
by how much money they spend.

1018
01:04:31,734 --> 01:04:33,759
Not by what it achieves.

1019
01:04:33,836 --> 01:04:36,896
The bigger budget they have,
the more impressed they are.

1020
01:04:36,973 --> 01:04:40,670
The fact that it doesn't achieve
anything, all the clinics don't exist,

1021
01:04:40,743 --> 01:04:44,770
no one seems to care back in the States,
that information doesn't get there.

1022
01:04:47,483 --> 01:04:49,576
[in foreign language]
No one is helping this place,

1023
01:04:49,652 --> 01:04:51,415
and if there is,
no one is distributing it.

1024
01:04:53,956 --> 01:04:59,417
There are more than 800 houses
here but no school or hospital.

1025
01:05:01,964 --> 01:05:04,762
We are living the same now
as we were under the Taliban.

1026
01:05:04,834 --> 01:05:07,894
America must hold
our government accountable.

1027
01:05:07,970 --> 01:05:12,634
America must ask why didn't you pave
the streets with the money we gave you.

1028
01:05:14,944 --> 01:05:18,072
All those houses were destroyed
by foreign countries.

1029
01:05:18,147 --> 01:05:21,014
Why don't they rebuild those houses?

1030
01:05:21,083 --> 01:05:23,551
They haven't done
anything positive here.

1031
01:05:35,998 --> 01:05:38,831
Two years ago, the U.S. Ambassador
came here and said,

1032
01:05:38,901 --> 01:05:42,530
"We're going to make a pledge to rebuild
the school." It's been two years.

1033
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:45,267
Look at this place.
This is hearts and minds.

1034
01:05:45,341 --> 01:05:47,366
It looks like a bomb went off yesterday.

1035
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:52,274
There's bullet holes. The front of the
building is riddled with bullet holes.

1036
01:05:52,348 --> 01:05:53,940
Blast holes.

1037
01:05:56,018 --> 01:05:57,713
Nothing's being done.

1038
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:00,949
We've got to do something
for these kids.

1039
01:06:01,023 --> 01:06:04,925
We've gotta do something for these kids
to say, "Somebody cares about us.

1040
01:06:04,994 --> 01:06:07,292
Somebody cares about
us getting educated.

1041
01:06:07,363 --> 01:06:10,059
Somebody wants us
to be in a safe environment."

1042
01:06:14,503 --> 01:06:17,631
[Morgan] As somebody about to
become a father for the first time,

1043
01:06:17,707 --> 01:06:22,110
it's so instilling in me, reminding me,
of the things that I want for my family.

1044
01:06:22,912 --> 01:06:26,848
I don't ever want my child to be in
a position where they can't be educated.

1045
01:06:26,916 --> 01:06:30,909
Or can't feel like they can better
themselves, like that this is it.

1046
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:33,387
That this is as good
as it gets for their life,

1047
01:06:33,456 --> 01:06:36,550
and to not have hope
that tomorrow is going to be better.

1048
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:46,702
- [phone ringing]
- Ow.

1049
01:06:46,702 --> 01:06:48,897
- [phone ringing]
- Ow.

1050
01:06:48,971 --> 01:06:52,065
Man, this baby starts kicking
as soon as your phone rings.

1051
01:06:52,908 --> 01:06:55,035
- Baby knew I was calling.
- We miss you.

1052
01:06:55,111 --> 01:06:57,204
Baby knew. Ow!

1053
01:06:57,279 --> 01:06:59,975
- Oh, I miss you so much.
- Yeah. Me, too.

1054
01:07:00,816 --> 01:07:02,807
[Morgan] I dreamt we had
a girl last night.

1055
01:07:02,885 --> 01:07:04,477
[woman] That's cute.

1056
01:07:14,296 --> 01:07:16,491
[Morgan] Ever see
Osama bin Laden around here?

1057
01:07:16,565 --> 01:07:18,999
[in foreign language] God know,
if we catch him, we will tear him apart.

1058
01:07:19,068 --> 01:07:22,196
Osama bin Laden's Afghan's enemies.

1059
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:26,341
[in foreign language] Who is Osama?

1060
01:07:26,409 --> 01:07:29,640
He is the one who destroyed
those buildings in America.

1061
01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:31,873
Fuck him.
And fuck America.

1062
01:07:34,450 --> 01:07:36,918
I'm looking for Osama bin Laden.

1063
01:07:36,986 --> 01:07:39,887
- Pakistan.
- Pakistan?

1064
01:07:39,955 --> 01:07:41,718
- Pakistan.
- OK!

1065
01:07:42,558 --> 01:07:44,355
Pakistan? Pakistan.

1066
01:07:44,427 --> 01:07:46,418
[in foreign language]
It is very obvious to the world

1067
01:07:46,495 --> 01:07:47,587
that he is hiding in Pakistan.

1068
01:07:47,663 --> 01:07:50,928
You should find him
so we have peace in the world.

1069
01:07:52,868 --> 01:07:54,995
[Morgan] I'm looking for
Osama bin Laden.

1070
01:07:55,104 --> 01:07:57,163
[in foreign language] Tribal area.

1071
01:07:57,239 --> 01:07:58,399
Near Peshawar?

1072
01:07:58,474 --> 01:08:01,500
[heart beat on speaker]

1073
01:08:01,577 --> 01:08:03,704
That is so cool.
I love you so much.

1074
01:08:03,779 --> 01:08:05,747
I love you too, baby.

1075
01:08:06,082 --> 01:08:08,016
[imitating heartbeat]

1076
01:08:08,084 --> 01:08:10,382
That was my baby's
little disco heartbeat.

1077
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:17,025
What will happen if I go
to Pakistan to look for him?

1078
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:18,720
[in foreign language]
You will find him.

1079
01:08:18,794 --> 01:08:19,783
I will find him?

1080
01:08:21,297 --> 01:08:23,731
You want to come look for him with me?

1081
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:28,502
No? [laughing]

1082
01:08:28,571 --> 01:08:30,129
Why not?

1083
01:08:33,309 --> 01:08:34,298
I'll miss my family.

1084
01:08:34,376 --> 01:08:37,072
- [man] I'm gonna miss my family.
- You'll miss your family.

1085
01:08:37,146 --> 01:08:38,511
I miss my family very much.

1086
01:08:40,182 --> 01:08:42,650
If I went into the tribal area,
you think I'd be OK?

1087
01:08:42,718 --> 01:08:46,085
[in foreign language] God knows
what will happen if you go there.

1088
01:08:46,155 --> 01:08:48,988
Something terrible will happen to you.

1089
01:08:49,992 --> 01:08:52,051
You're finished.

1090
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:54,153
The Taliban will cut your head.

1091
01:08:54,230 --> 01:08:56,460
- They'll cut my head? Yeah.
- Yeah.

1092
01:08:57,233 --> 01:08:58,530
Ugh!

1093
01:08:59,735 --> 01:09:03,034
So Alex started getting
contractions last night.

1094
01:09:03,105 --> 01:09:07,474
Braxton Hicks contractions,
which aren't real contractions,

1095
01:09:07,543 --> 01:09:10,637
but it's your body
preparing for a contraction.

1096
01:09:10,713 --> 01:09:12,348
And, here I am, missing it all.

1097
01:09:12,348 --> 01:09:14,248
And, here I am, missing it all.

1098
01:09:14,316 --> 01:09:17,410
Missing it all, man, missing it all.

1099
01:09:17,486 --> 01:09:19,454
[man singing in Arabic]

1100
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:35,593
[Morgan] We just found out from U.S.
military that we can go out on an embed.

1101
01:09:35,671 --> 01:09:40,199
And it's frightening. But the most
important thing, for me, is to try and,

1102
01:09:40,276 --> 01:09:43,245
hopefully, just narrow down the path

1103
01:09:43,312 --> 01:09:47,305
to finding the most wanted man
on the planet.

1104
01:09:47,383 --> 01:09:51,547
How much they're actually looking for
this guy, who knows? But we'll find out.

1105
01:09:52,855 --> 01:09:54,584
This stuff is so heavy.

1106
01:09:59,728 --> 01:10:04,131
Everything in your body tells you
you shouldn't be going to a job,

1107
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:07,499
or doing something where you
gotta wear a bulletproof vest.

1108
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:14,331
[man] The next thing
you'll see here in America...

1109
01:10:16,045 --> 01:10:17,774
...you'll see terrorism.

1110
01:10:20,249 --> 01:10:23,548
If you don't think you'll see,
you're blinding yourself to the

1111
01:10:23,619 --> 01:10:28,113
historic development of everything
taking place on this earth.

1112
01:10:36,131 --> 01:10:37,860
Terrorism.

1113
01:10:39,969 --> 01:10:41,231
Terrorism.

1114
01:10:41,303 --> 01:10:45,535
[man] First of all, I'd like to welcome
all of you guys to Firebase Apache.

1115
01:10:45,608 --> 01:10:48,668
- What questions do you have?
- Will we be able to speak

1116
01:10:48,744 --> 01:10:52,703
to any of the people in the area
who actually live in the local villages?

1117
01:10:53,115 --> 01:10:56,243
Um, when you go out to 4-2, yeah.

1118
01:10:56,318 --> 01:10:58,809
- There's a village right next to them.
- OK.

1119
01:10:58,887 --> 01:11:02,345
And that village also happens
to be full of Taliban.

1120
01:11:02,424 --> 01:11:06,053
[woman] I'd like to remind you, while
talking about going outside the wire.

1121
01:11:06,128 --> 01:11:09,564
When whoever we're with, whoever's
escorting us says, "Let's go,"

1122
01:11:09,632 --> 01:11:12,897
get in the vehicle and go.
It doesn't mean finish your question.

1123
01:11:12,968 --> 01:11:14,526
It means go now.

1124
01:11:14,603 --> 01:11:17,731
[Leppert] This is hardcore
Taliban country, let me tell you.

1125
01:11:19,508 --> 01:11:21,874
Over those mountains,
that's Afghanistan.

1126
01:11:21,944 --> 01:11:25,004
If you go over those mountains,
that's Pakistan.

1127
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:28,140
We're centrally located
with a lot of activity around us.

1128
01:11:28,217 --> 01:11:30,344
[Morgan] Will we stop
in a village tomorrow?

1129
01:11:30,419 --> 01:11:33,252
- Yes, we will.
- What's the plan for the afternoon?

1130
01:11:33,322 --> 01:11:36,780
We're fogbound, we'll test fire
weapons, talk, whatever you want.

1131
01:11:36,859 --> 01:11:37,951
You've got free rein.

1132
01:11:50,539 --> 01:11:52,837
I had a lot of grouping
right beside the guy.

1133
01:11:53,676 --> 01:11:56,406
Well, if nothing else,
it scared the hell out of him.

1134
01:11:57,746 --> 01:11:59,611
Can I try a rocket launcher?

1135
01:12:13,262 --> 01:12:15,696
[laughing] That was awesome.

1136
01:12:15,764 --> 01:12:18,790
You've been here six months.
You might be able to tell me.

1137
01:12:18,867 --> 01:12:20,095
Where is Osama bin Laden?

1138
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:22,433
[Leppert] We ask that
every time we go out.

1139
01:12:22,504 --> 01:12:28,204
"Hey? You guys know where Osama's at?"
They always point up to the mountains.

1140
01:12:28,277 --> 01:12:29,938
[in foreign language] Where's Osama?

1141
01:12:30,012 --> 01:12:31,809
[laughter]

1142
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:34,872
- [Morgan] Where's Osama bin Laden?
- I have no clue.

1143
01:12:34,950 --> 01:12:35,939
Is he alive?

1144
01:12:36,018 --> 01:12:38,077
Even if he was,
I don't think we'd know.

1145
01:12:44,727 --> 01:12:49,687
We are going to stop
and speak to villagers.

1146
01:12:49,765 --> 01:12:53,030
They said I should
write my blood type on

1147
01:12:53,102 --> 01:12:57,436
anything that'd be attached to me.

1148
01:12:58,974 --> 01:13:01,067
Scary as shit, man.

1149
01:13:01,877 --> 01:13:05,779
What we're concentrating on
is your security. That's it.

1150
01:13:05,848 --> 01:13:08,408
In a firefight I'm going to come in.

1151
01:13:08,484 --> 01:13:11,942
Come to this effect, bring you in
and we'll grab you to here.

1152
01:13:12,020 --> 01:13:14,853
As soon as I do,
I'm going to try to grab you again.

1153
01:13:14,923 --> 01:13:17,585
As soon as it's safe,
then we're going to move out.

1154
01:13:17,659 --> 01:13:21,925
When we go out, we expect to have
contact. We expect to get shot at.

1155
01:13:21,997 --> 01:13:25,558
Anything goes out there. We always
got to be ready for everything.

1156
01:13:42,184 --> 01:13:44,652
[man] This is what we call
a "friendly village."

1157
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:47,848
[laughter]

1158
01:13:47,923 --> 01:13:51,086
[man] Once they understand
it's their choice to talk,

1159
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:52,718
the forces will stand back.

1160
01:13:52,795 --> 01:13:56,128
And then whoever wants to talk to you
will talk to you.

1161
01:13:56,198 --> 01:13:58,325
[man] Morgan, come up,
let's introduce you.

1162
01:13:58,400 --> 01:13:59,867
Yes, sir.

1163
01:13:59,935 --> 01:14:01,732
[in foreign language]
This person is a civilian

1164
01:14:01,804 --> 01:14:03,772
from America and wants
to ask you some questions.

1165
01:14:03,839 --> 01:14:06,899
His name is Morgan.

1166
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:09,443
[Morgan] I was hoping you could
tell me your thoughts

1167
01:14:09,511 --> 01:14:11,979
on the Taliban and
the current conflict happening.

1168
01:14:12,047 --> 01:14:13,446
[in foreign language]
What do you think,

1169
01:14:13,515 --> 01:14:14,914
who is happy with battles?
No one is happy with battles.

1170
01:14:14,983 --> 01:14:17,952
We are not happy.

1171
01:14:18,020 --> 01:14:21,217
We don't like the war.
We want a peaceful life.

1172
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:24,555
We are neither your friends nor the
Taliban's. We just want a simple life.

1173
01:14:24,626 --> 01:14:28,062
What are things, when you look
at your village, you need the most?

1174
01:14:28,130 --> 01:14:29,324
In terms of assistance.

1175
01:14:29,398 --> 01:14:34,233
The most important problem
is the lack of water.

1176
01:14:34,303 --> 01:14:37,431
Before the base drilled their well

1177
01:14:37,506 --> 01:14:40,566
we didn't have any water problems.

1178
01:14:40,642 --> 01:14:43,167
- What do you think of Osama bin Laden?
- [man] Morgan!

1179
01:14:43,245 --> 01:14:45,713
Let's go now! Now!

1180
01:14:47,416 --> 01:14:49,407
- Come on!
- Let's go now!

1181
01:14:55,691 --> 01:14:58,751
[man on radio] Be advised, I've
just been informed of an ambush,

1182
01:14:58,827 --> 01:15:01,193
possibly the governor's convoy.

1183
01:15:01,263 --> 01:15:04,790
[man 2] And we are in pursuit
of two individuals on foot.

1184
01:15:10,272 --> 01:15:15,266
Jedi-1, we're at 2-0-6. That village to
our left is where the Taliban went to.

1185
01:15:21,483 --> 01:15:23,314
We have one downed Taliban.

1186
01:15:23,385 --> 01:15:26,013
We have their motorcycle
in our possession. Over.

1187
01:15:34,329 --> 01:15:38,789
[Morgan] People have said Afghanistan is
a winnable war. What are your thoughts?

1188
01:15:38,867 --> 01:15:41,358
In counter-insurgency,
killing doesn't work.

1189
01:15:41,436 --> 01:15:45,133
Got to work on the center of gravity,
the people.

1190
01:15:45,207 --> 01:15:48,005
They like having clean water,
having a medical clinic.

1191
01:15:48,076 --> 01:15:50,544
They like seeing
their kids go to school.

1192
01:15:50,612 --> 01:15:53,672
It just makes it more difficult
for the Taliban to change the tide

1193
01:15:53,749 --> 01:15:55,239
and get the people
to go to the other side.

1194
01:15:55,317 --> 01:15:57,785
[in foreign language] Thank you
and please tell your commander

1195
01:15:57,853 --> 01:15:58,911
the father of Taza Gui
says peace.

1196
01:15:58,987 --> 01:16:02,980
[Morgan] What would have happened if
we had sent more troops here in 2002?

1197
01:16:03,058 --> 01:16:05,788
You would have killed more Taliban,

1198
01:16:05,861 --> 01:16:08,694
but, I mean, we're killing
a lot of Taliban right now.

1199
01:16:08,764 --> 01:16:12,860
And they've got the open sieve
from the madrassas of Pakistan

1200
01:16:12,935 --> 01:16:17,338
in the refugee camps that go to
these young kids who don't have a job,

1201
01:16:17,406 --> 01:16:21,672
who have no positive outlook in life.
They sell them with a lot of propaganda.

1202
01:16:21,743 --> 01:16:25,406
Tell them they're going to give
their family money, bring them here.

1203
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:27,846
- Where is Osama?
- I think he's in Pakistan.

1204
01:16:27,950 --> 01:16:29,941
[beeping]

1205
01:16:36,692 --> 01:16:40,184
I think it's quite likely
that Osama bin Laden is in Pakistan.

1206
01:16:40,262 --> 01:16:43,322
[woman] The latest intelligence
has always seemed to indicate

1207
01:16:43,398 --> 01:16:45,025
that he is in Pakistan.

1208
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:47,864
[man] He's probably somewhere
along that border region.

1209
01:16:47,936 --> 01:16:50,404
- Pakistan.
- Along that border.

1210
01:16:50,472 --> 01:16:52,133
Tribal areas of Pakistan.

1211
01:16:52,207 --> 01:16:55,074
Senior leadership,
number one and two are there.

1212
01:16:55,143 --> 01:16:59,375
On the Pakistan border it's particularly
dangerous, a region where terror rules.

1213
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:02,747
And where many believe
Osama bin Laden could be hiding.

1214
01:17:03,685 --> 01:17:07,018
Everyone I've spoken to
said this is where Osama's hiding out.

1215
01:17:07,089 --> 01:17:09,785
[Morgan] Everyone, that is,
except for Pakistanis.

1216
01:17:09,858 --> 01:17:11,553
- Where is Osama?
- [Morgan] You tell me.

1217
01:17:11,627 --> 01:17:14,790
- Where is Osama?
- I'm looking for him. You tell me.

1218
01:17:14,863 --> 01:17:16,387
[in foreign language]
He's in Afghanistan.

1219
01:17:16,465 --> 01:17:18,160
Osama bin Laden is here.

1220
01:17:18,233 --> 01:17:19,222
Afghanistan.

1221
01:17:19,301 --> 01:17:21,394
Osama bin Laden...

1222
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:23,301
Which animal is that?

1223
01:17:23,372 --> 01:17:27,331
I don't where he is, but it's also
a question if he's alive or dead.

1224
01:17:27,409 --> 01:17:30,845
But, um, his influence is here.

1225
01:17:31,146 --> 01:17:33,444
[in foreign language] He is
a great soldier of the Muslims.

1226
01:17:33,515 --> 01:17:36,177
He is fighting for righteousness.

1227
01:17:36,251 --> 01:17:38,082
He's a diamond.

1228
01:17:38,153 --> 01:17:40,144
Osama is exploiting the root causes.

1229
01:17:40,222 --> 01:17:44,090
If we find the root causes,
we'll solve everything.

1230
01:17:44,159 --> 01:17:47,822
- Osama bin Laden is nothing, sir.
- He is only one! One person!

1231
01:17:49,031 --> 01:17:53,161
Dude, look at that.
Even in Pakistan they love wrestling.

1232
01:17:53,235 --> 01:17:56,966
- All the people like the wrestling.
- Tell me why you like wrestling.

1233
01:17:57,039 --> 01:18:01,305
- Because wrestling is fair.
- Can I let you in on a little secret?

1234
01:18:01,376 --> 01:18:02,570
- It's fixed.
- Fixed?

1235
01:18:02,644 --> 01:18:04,908
- Fixed. It's not real.
- Maybe.

1236
01:18:04,980 --> 01:18:07,710
- You are right. I know. You are right.
- OK. Good.

1237
01:18:07,783 --> 01:18:11,719
But when it is for a belt,

1238
01:18:11,787 --> 01:18:13,379
then it is not fixed.

1239
01:18:16,525 --> 01:18:19,585
I'm looking, uh... How are you?

1240
01:18:20,162 --> 01:18:22,096
How are you? Hi.

1241
01:18:22,164 --> 01:18:23,688
I'm just looking...

1242
01:18:25,167 --> 01:18:28,864
[Morgan] Just based on what everybody
has said, I got to think we're within

1243
01:18:28,937 --> 01:18:32,236
a couple hundred miles of where he is.
Maybe even less.

1244
01:18:32,307 --> 01:18:34,571
Yeah, OK. OK. Thank you.

1245
01:18:44,019 --> 01:18:47,887
Tomorrow we're heading into
this area of the tribal regions,

1246
01:18:47,956 --> 01:18:53,053
just past Peshawar, where everyone
has told me Osama bin Laden is.

1247
01:18:55,630 --> 01:18:58,360
I mean, I have no idea
what to expect when I get there.

1248
01:19:02,337 --> 01:19:06,205
I've been traveling for months
to try and find this person

1249
01:19:06,274 --> 01:19:11,871
that everybody we talk to...
You know, they all say,

1250
01:19:11,947 --> 01:19:16,350
"Why are you looking for this person?
What is he? He's one man?"

1251
01:19:18,787 --> 01:19:21,551
The thing that I've realized
is that this whole trip

1252
01:19:21,623 --> 01:19:27,186
is a chance to actually go out
and see and talk to those people

1253
01:19:27,262 --> 01:19:30,060
that we're told to be
so scared of all the time.

1254
01:19:30,699 --> 01:19:33,668
I'm not somebody who thinks we can
sit around the campfire

1255
01:19:33,735 --> 01:19:36,932
and sing Kumbaya, you know?
That's ridiculous.

1256
01:19:37,005 --> 01:19:38,996
[laughing]

1257
01:19:39,074 --> 01:19:44,273
But I believe that we create
these demons within ourselves.

1258
01:19:44,346 --> 01:19:46,746
And we create these demons
within the media.

1259
01:19:46,815 --> 01:19:51,514
And we create these visions
that are so beyond reality.

1260
01:19:52,187 --> 01:19:54,621
They start feeding themselves
after a while.

1261
01:19:54,689 --> 01:19:58,250
Our fear just becomes exponential.

1262
01:20:13,809 --> 01:20:17,210
They say when you go
looking for trouble, you'll find it.

1263
01:20:17,279 --> 01:20:20,976
It's not that I'm looking for trouble.
I'm just looking for answers.

1264
01:20:21,049 --> 01:20:23,040
And I think I've found a lot.

1265
01:20:23,852 --> 01:20:26,286
I think I've found a lot on this trip.

1266
01:20:27,022 --> 01:20:30,514
"Attention. Entry of foreigners
is prohibited beyond this point."

1267
01:20:32,961 --> 01:20:35,589
Even if I go over the border
to find Osama,

1268
01:20:35,664 --> 01:20:38,895
it's not going to, suddenly,
make the world safer for my kid.

1269
01:20:38,967 --> 01:20:42,266
The things that are pushing people
to follow him and his ideas

1270
01:20:42,337 --> 01:20:45,738
are still going to be there.
And that's what we have to change.

1271
01:20:47,709 --> 01:20:50,041
I think that we need
to take a step back...

1272
01:20:51,813 --> 01:20:55,510
...and really ask ourselves, "What kind
of a world do we want to live in?

1273
01:20:56,351 --> 01:20:58,216
What do we want that world to be?"

1274
01:21:04,059 --> 01:21:06,254
It's not worth it.

1275
01:21:17,839 --> 01:21:20,637
So her water just broke,
which is very exciting.

1276
01:21:20,709 --> 01:21:23,109
So, I'm that much closer.

1277
01:21:27,582 --> 01:21:29,914
- OK.
- OK? You want to get up?

[laughter]

1280
01:21:44,766 --> 01:21:46,097
[woman] It's your son!

1281
01:21:46,167 --> 01:21:50,365
- [Morgan] It's a boy!
- [Alex] We have a baby boy!

1282
01:21:50,438 --> 01:21:53,669
- We have a baby boy.
- Oh, my God! He's beautiful.

1283
01:21:53,742 --> 01:21:57,803
- [crying]
- [laughter]

1284
01:22:00,815 --> 01:22:02,874
[Morgan] So,
I didn't end up finding Osama.

1285
01:22:02,951 --> 01:22:06,079
What I did find, is that there
are a lot more people out there

1286
01:22:06,154 --> 01:22:09,123
who are just like us,
than there are who are just like him.

1287
01:22:09,190 --> 01:22:13,388
I'll always bet on the billions of
regular people to win over the crazies.

1288
01:22:13,461 --> 01:22:16,589
After all, we all want
the same things for our families.

1289
01:22:16,665 --> 01:22:20,294
We want the world to be a place
where we can raise and love our kids.

1290
01:22:20,368 --> 01:22:23,701
Where they can have everything
they need to be happy, healthy,

1291
01:22:23,772 --> 01:22:25,763
without it blowing up around them.

1292
01:22:26,074 --> 01:22:30,238
It's not going to be easy. And all that
reward money sure would have helped but,

1293
01:22:30,312 --> 01:22:34,339
hey, you know what?
He's going to love public school.
