1
00:00:25,484 --> 00:00:27,945
<i>Girl, I'm glad you decided
to let me cut your hair.</i>

2
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:30,948
<i>Hair is a form of expression...</i>

3
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:33,033
<i>especially in the black community.</i>

4
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:35,327
<i>It serves as a form of identity...</i>

5
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:38,330
<i>a way of characterizing
who you are...</i>

6
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:41,583
<i>- an expression of your own individual personality.</i>

7
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:46,839
<i>And often, it doesn't even
have to be your own hair...</i>

8
00:00:46,922 --> 00:00:49,800
<i>in order for it to be
your form of expression.</i>

9
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,844
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

10
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:54,304
<i>See, the way I figure it...</i>

11
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:57,850
<i>horse hair, camel hair,
raccoon hair...</i>

12
00:00:57,933 --> 00:00:59,852
<i>whatever type ofhair...</i>

13
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:03,355
<i>Girlfriend, if you bought it, it's yours.</i>

14
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:06,316
<i>Now, since hair is
so important to sisters...</i>

15
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,152
<i>you may find that we spend
a lot of time gathering...</i>

16
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:11,196
<i>in the place where we get it done.</i>

17
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:13,240
<i>That place is...</i>

18
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:58,387
<i>You're watching 2 News, Baltimore.</i>

19
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,389
<i>Ten days ago, Mayor Martin O'Malley...</i>

20
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:02,766
<i>kicked off the
Baltimore Believe program...</i>

21
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:04,810
a massive drug-fighting
campaign and an effort...

22
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:06,812
to get people to take back
their neighborhoods.

23
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:09,356
You may have already
seen the spots on TV.

24
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,441
<i>It's a serious campaign
for a serious problem.</i>

25
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:13,986
- Trey?
- Yeah?

26
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:17,239
- Have you finished eatin' your breakfast?
- Yeah.

27
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:24,621
And you'd better not be
playing that Nintendo.

28
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:27,082
<i>Of course, while not everyone has seen the ads...</i>

29
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:31,086
<i>those who have are buying
into its powerful message.</i>

30
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:33,463
Hey.

31
00:03:38,594 --> 00:03:41,430
Oh.

32
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:43,640
- Mmm.
- Ah.

33
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:47,853
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

34
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:52,024
Mmm.

35
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:58,447
You know, every time
I look at this tennis bracelet...

36
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,449
it just turns me on more.

37
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:02,451
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

38
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:04,453
I like it when
you turned on, baby.

39
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:07,372
- Look at it some more. Look at it some more.
- God, I love it.

40
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:09,374
- You know...
- Uh-huh?

41
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,376
- When basketball season starts again...
- Mm-hmm?

42
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,171
- get my check and get you another one, baby.
- Mm-hmm.

43
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:17,007
- Yeah? You like that, huh?
- Mmm. I like the sound of that.

44
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:20,719
So many diamonds.
Yes, take me, baby.

45
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,814
<i>Okay, uh, get me one of those,
three of those...</i>

46
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:37,069
five of those, mmm,
three of those...

47
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:41,240
- and seven of those, yeah.
- Think you have enough there?

48
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,536
Huh? What?

49
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:49,540
Wait, just 'cause I'm a big girl,
you think you can call me out like that?

50
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:52,084
Oh. No, no, no. No offense.
I was just saying...

51
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:54,837
You were just saying what?
What was you just saying? Huh? Huh?

52
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,548
Say another smart remark, you gonna
be saying it up off the ground.

53
00:04:57,589 --> 00:05:01,718
How about that? Don't let your mouth
write a check your ass can't cash, buddy.

54
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:05,097
A sister like me don't play that.

55
00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:07,891
- Lashaunna. Come on!
- What?

56
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:10,018
I'm comin'!

57
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:35,210
What you lookin' at?

58
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:38,255
Nothing. Trust me,
I ain't looking at a damn thing.

59
00:05:38,297 --> 00:05:44,136
<i>- Hey, baby,
don't forget to pick me up at lunchtime.
- Okay, l... I won't.</i>

60
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:47,431
I don't wanna be standing out here
like I'm an idiot or something. Be on time.

61
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:50,267
- Okay.
- And Mr. Gay Man,
I suggest you fix that little look...

62
00:05:50,309 --> 00:05:52,936
on your face before I come over
there and fix it for you.

63
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:57,065
Try it, Mr. Man. Try it, 'cause I will scratch
your eyes out... right out of the socket.

64
00:05:57,149 --> 00:06:01,361
<i>Gay don't mean I can't fight. Come on over
here and see if I don't embarrass you.</i>

65
00:06:01,445 --> 00:06:03,405
- What? Take it.
- Check your man.

66
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,407
- Take it.
- I'm not playing with him anymore.

67
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,911
And I ain't playin'
with you no more either. What?

68
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:12,414
That's right. Take your ass to work,
Mr. Gas Station Man. Go, go, go, go, go, go!

69
00:06:12,498 --> 00:06:14,750
D.D! You don't
have to do all that.

70
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:17,252
<i>Why you let him treat you
like that?</i>

71
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:20,214
- He don't mean it like that. He loves me.

72
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:22,466
He sure has a funny way
of showin' it.

73
00:06:22,508 --> 00:06:25,135
<i>Now what makes
a beauty shop such a unique spot...</i>

74
00:06:25,177 --> 00:06:28,013
<i>is that it really is
a microcosm of society...</i>

75
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:30,390
<i>a cross section
of the black community.</i>

76
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:34,895
<i>It serves as everything from a cosmetic fix
to an escape from the real world.</i>

77
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:38,774
<i>And everybody
has their different reasons for coming here.</i>

78
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:41,693
<i>But when you sit in that chair
for those few hours...</i>

79
00:06:41,777 --> 00:06:45,280
<i>it's as though you become one
with your beautician, with the environment.</i>

80
00:06:45,364 --> 00:06:48,158
<i>For those few hours,
you and your beautician are best of friends.</i>

81
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,870
I finally did like you said.
I cut off all forms of sex with him.

82
00:06:51,954 --> 00:06:53,664
See? That's what I'm talkin' about.

83
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:57,793
<i>Broke down his whole little game plan.
I got stuff working like a charm.</i>

84
00:06:57,876 --> 00:06:59,795
<i>- What up, Rick?
- What up, Jen?</i>

85
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:03,048
I learnt that trick from Shante
in "Two Can Play That Game."
Should be required watching.

86
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,050
Wanda, don't let
that girl steer you wrong.

87
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:07,970
Come on now. Lashaunna ain't never
steered nobody wrong in her life.

88
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:10,347
Now don't tell that lie.
Please.

89
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,559
I don't let no man get up on me.
I got to stay up on the game.

90
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:18,814
- Oh, what, game recognize game?
- That's right. Game recognize game, baby.
And you know this!

91
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:22,818
- Hey, girl, take a seat in my chair. I'll be right out.
- Hold your ear.

92
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:38,542
$128,000.

93
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:42,087
Wow.

94
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:53,849
Please. Come on. That's a movie.
It's a damn fable. Them little tricks don't work.

95
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:56,894
Yes, they do.
'Cause I done tried it several times.

96
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:59,605
Whatever.
Let me tell you all something, man.

97
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:04,109
A true player can juggle all of his women,
plus keep everybody happy and never get caught.

98
00:08:04,193 --> 00:08:06,111
Trust me when I tell you, all right?

99
00:08:06,195 --> 00:08:08,864
<i>Put that on everything
I know, dawg. I mean, sis.</i>

100
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:11,992
Whatever, bro.
Mr. Player-Player.

101
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:14,036
Somebody gonna catch you
one of these days.

102
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:16,872
- Never. That day'll never come.
- Never say "never."

103
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:19,208
Never. Let me say it
one more time: "Never."

104
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:22,211
- Like you havin' a husband... never?
- How you doing, Shelly?

105
00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:24,755
<i>- I'm good. I can't complain.
- What you gonna get today?</i>

106
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:27,591
- Girl, I need a touch-up. Look at my color.
- I see it.

107
00:08:27,633 --> 00:08:30,385
- You guys know what I mean?
- What you two fools arguing about?

108
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:32,763
Talking about her
shavin' her chest.

109
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:35,933
- Talking about his little secret.
He only got one ball.

110
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:39,811
She need to shave that. We got customers in here.
She gonna chase customers away.

111
00:08:39,895 --> 00:08:44,107
<i>It was an accident, right? One of them little
hoochies he was dealing with bit it off.</i>

112
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:46,777
- Player! Gotcha!
- I'm telling you, you gotta get
some tweezers or something.

113
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:49,112
- D.D.'s in the house!
- Oh, Lord.

114
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:52,950
D.D.'s in the house.
Say it. Party can begin. Mmm!

115
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:55,410
- Hey, baby.
- Oh, girl, gay and fine.

116
00:08:55,494 --> 00:08:58,622
- I've been workin'. D.D., work it.
- Hey, guys.

117
00:08:58,664 --> 00:09:00,624
- Hey, Brenda.
- Hey, Brenda, baby.

118
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,793
<i>- Mmm! Mmm!
- Say, say, say, say, man.</i>

119
00:09:02,835 --> 00:09:05,420
You mind not prancing
your little gay ass in front of me?

120
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:08,674
Don't knock it till you try it. Mmm, mmm.
Don't knock it till you try it.

121
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:10,676
Trust me.
You just might like it.

122
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:13,136
Move your ass out of the way.
I ain't playing that.

123
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,722
Oh! Girl,
I'm feeling good today.

124
00:09:15,806 --> 00:09:17,766
- Yes, I am!
- It's too early for all of this.

125
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:20,811
D.D., sit your happy ass down.

126
00:09:20,853 --> 00:09:23,522
Girl, I'm about to work me up
a sweat early in the morning.

127
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:28,193
<i>Honey, you should have seen me
in my modeling days. Baby, I was fierce!</i>

128
00:09:28,277 --> 00:09:30,612
I doubt that.

129
00:09:30,696 --> 00:09:33,198
Look, fish in the corner,
don't start with me today, okay?

130
00:09:33,282 --> 00:09:35,659
I'm in a good mood,
and I don't feel like hearing your trap.

131
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:38,161
Don't call me "fish," little girl.

132
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:42,833
Well, from the amount of men that you had
from waist down, she sure smell like one.

133
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:46,837
- Ouch!
- Y'all, he just jealous 'cause he don't look like this.

134
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,631
<i>Girl, jealous? Please.
Everything about you is fake.</i>

135
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:54,553
<i>But I guess if I had the money, I'd have no
choice but to buy it too, if I looked like you.</i>

136
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:56,847
Oh, D.D., please.
You know Miss Trina work it.

137
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,974
Work it, not.
D.D. in the house.

138
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:02,936
<i>Well, D.D. need to get out
the house. Go to your station.</i>

139
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:05,022
What you readin', Brenda?

140
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:07,149
My daily word.

141
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:09,693
<i>What's the word today?</i>

142
00:10:09,735 --> 00:10:13,989
- It's about believin' in yourself.
- That's right.

143
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:17,576
Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my gosh, girl.

144
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:21,747
- I am fittin' to go to work,
but I got some news for you.
- Here we go with "Ricki Lake."

145
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,708
- Don't act like you don't wanna
hear what she got to say.
- I don't.

146
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,668
- Yes, you do.
- No, I don't.

147
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:28,879
<i>That's all that women stuff.</i>

148
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:32,382
Hey, look, this is all man here.
I ain't tryin' to hear that.

149
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:35,427
You all man workin' up in a beauty shop?
Please. You sound real stupid.

150
00:10:35,511 --> 00:10:38,931
No, you know what sound real stupid,
is that girlie nasal talk you been doin'.

151
00:10:39,014 --> 00:10:42,017
Please, don't even let me get started
on what sound stupid, Mr. Man.

152
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:46,063
I'm having a good day, and I don't want you
or nobody else in here to ruin that, okay?

153
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:50,108
- Go ahead and get started, homegirl.
- Y'all shut up! Shut it up!

154
00:10:50,192 --> 00:10:52,402
- You mad at me?
- Shut it up!

155
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:57,282
- Now what's the news, girl? Go ahead.
- You remember my girl, Linda?

156
00:10:57,366 --> 00:10:59,868
Was always trying to give advice
because she got...

157
00:10:59,952 --> 00:11:02,371
- the perfect relationship with her boyfriend?
- Mm-hmm.

158
00:11:02,454 --> 00:11:05,249
<i>Well, Linda come home last night
and found her boyfriend...</i>

159
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,626
in her bed with a white woman!

160
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:10,420
- Oh!
- Uh-uh.

161
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:13,257
- Oh! Girl, what'd she do?
- Girl, she damn near killed them!

162
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,801
<i>She went to the kitchen,
got herself a butcher knife...</i>

163
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:18,554
chased both him and the white bitch
out the house, butt naked!

164
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:20,639
<i>- Damn!
- That's right! That's right!</i>

165
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:23,100
- That's gonna happen to you.
- The police came and everything.

166
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,602
It was a fiasco.

167
00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:27,604
I'm taking this new
vocabulary course, you know.

168
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:29,606
- Trying to get articulate.
- Go on, girl.

169
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:33,986
- It ain't workin'.
- Yes it is, hater.

170
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:37,239
Look, I'm late for work.
I gotta go, but I'll be back on my break.

171
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:40,284
- All right. I'll see you later, girl.
- Please don't.

172
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:42,327
<i>Oh, God.
Ricky, tell me something.</i>

173
00:11:42,411 --> 00:11:45,247
- Huh?
- What is it with black men and white women?

174
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,583
- What's the big fascination?
- What you askin' me for?

175
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:50,460
'Cause I know you done
had a few yourself.

176
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:54,131
What you talking about, girl? I don't be
messing with no white women. Don't even try it.

177
00:11:54,173 --> 00:11:56,800
- Not too sure about that.
- Don't be too sure about what?

178
00:11:56,884 --> 00:12:00,596
I know I'm sure about one thing.
You get down into some other things.

179
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:05,934
- What other things, raisin in the sun?
- You know, other "thingsss."

180
00:12:06,018 --> 00:12:09,021
What other "thingsss"?
Everything don't have an "S" at the end of it.

181
00:12:09,104 --> 00:12:11,315
<i>- Mmm. Okay.
- Come on, Ricky.</i>

182
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:14,109
<i>You gotta admit it. I mean,
what is it with them, all right?</i>

183
00:12:14,193 --> 00:12:16,987
Is it their docile
and subservient attitude?

184
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:20,991
Or maybe it's their nice, flat asses.

185
00:12:21,033 --> 00:12:23,952
- Yeah, just like "sha-shing"!
- Why you always ridin' me, man?

186
00:12:24,036 --> 00:12:27,706
- 'Cause, we know you into white women.
- It's cool. Snowflake.

187
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:29,708
- Hey, do the little pink toe.
- Mm-hmm.

188
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,835
<i>You know, that pisses me off.</i>

189
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:34,838
'Cause there are not enough available
black men out there as it is.

190
00:12:34,922 --> 00:12:37,841
- True.
- Either they're dead, gay...

191
00:12:37,883 --> 00:12:40,177
- Hey!
- or in jail.

192
00:12:40,219 --> 00:12:42,221
And now we gotta lose them
to white women?

193
00:12:42,304 --> 00:12:45,182
<i>Ooh, ooh, ooh!
I got a joke for you.</i>

194
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:48,894
What do you call jail
for a gay man?

195
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:50,979
- What?
- Paradise!

196
00:12:51,063 --> 00:12:54,525
Shut it down.

197
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:58,070
<i>I can't even front. I know I said a lot of things
about white folks, right?</i>

198
00:12:58,153 --> 00:13:00,656
But that Ben Affleck...

199
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:05,869
- Ooh, that is one fine white boy!
- Daredevil!

200
00:13:05,953 --> 00:13:09,206
<i>- Girl, you ain't never lied.
- Whoo!</i>

201
00:13:09,248 --> 00:13:12,209
I ain't never lied about that one, girl.

202
00:13:12,251 --> 00:13:14,378
Ooh, yeah. Honey, let me
tell you something now.

203
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:17,548
- My three top white men in the world:
- Mmm!

204
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:19,842
- Ben Affleck.
- Okay.
- Brad Pitt.

205
00:13:19,925 --> 00:13:22,386
- Oh, he could be a friend of mine.
- Ooh, yes.

206
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:25,180
- And Bill Clinton.
- Bill Clinton?

207
00:13:25,264 --> 00:13:27,724
- Who?
- Oh, hell, yeah!
- Bill?

208
00:13:27,766 --> 00:13:30,853
- Oh, Bill is fine, honey!
- That man is old.

209
00:13:30,936 --> 00:13:34,398
<i>Honey, I would have done exactly
what Monica did and more, honey.</i>

210
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:37,067
'Cause I got big lips.
It's all up in here.

211
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,778
- T.M.I. T.M.I.

212
00:13:39,862 --> 00:13:44,074
He is the president of the United States,
the most powerful man in the world.

213
00:13:44,116 --> 00:13:46,577
- Oh, girl.
- And he black too.

214
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:49,079
I'd have been like,
"Uh, my bad, Hillary.

215
00:13:49,121 --> 00:13:52,082
I got to do this
for my country."

216
00:13:54,126 --> 00:13:56,879
<i>- That made me a little hot right there.
- Let me ask you something.</i>

217
00:13:56,962 --> 00:13:59,214
Would you do George Bush?

218
00:13:59,298 --> 00:14:02,593
- You couldn't pay me to do George Bush.
- Girl!

219
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:06,096
- Black folks love them some Clinton, boy.
- Yeah, sure do. Sure do.

220
00:14:06,138 --> 00:14:08,140
<i>- Mm-hmm.
- Clinton's my dawg.</i>

221
00:14:08,182 --> 00:14:11,101
- Ooh, I wish he could have
run for a third term, girl.

222
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,986
Phone.

223
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:23,822
Get the phone! You ain't doin' nothin'.

224
00:14:23,906 --> 00:14:26,408
Look, I am not the secretary.
I'm a stylist.

225
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:28,744
- Get it right.
- Lazy. You need to fire her.

226
00:14:28,827 --> 00:14:30,579
<i>- Shut up!
- Strut, girl.</i>

227
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:33,123
Get the phone, Cookie Crisp.

228
00:14:33,165 --> 00:14:35,667
<i>- Hello?
- Always complaining about somethin'.</i>

229
00:14:35,751 --> 00:14:40,923
Yes. One moment please.

230
00:14:41,006 --> 00:14:43,342
<i>It's for you, Jenny.
It's the principal at Trey's school.</i>

231
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:46,637
- Uh-oh.
- What?

232
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:53,769
Hello? Yes.

233
00:14:55,521 --> 00:14:58,148
Yes, I see.

234
00:14:59,858 --> 00:15:01,860
I'll be right there.

235
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:22,381
Get in the car, boy.
Get in this car.

236
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:33,684
You know you in trouble.
You know you in trouble, right?

237
00:15:33,725 --> 00:15:36,812
- Man!
- Don't "man" me when I'm talkin' to you.

238
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:40,065
And don't turn your head away from me.
Look at me when I'm talkin' to you.

239
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:44,695
The principal said you got suspended
for fightin' in school.

240
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:46,697
Fightin' in school, Trey?

241
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,074
Like I ain't got enough issues
I gotta deal with...

242
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:52,161
- now I got to deal with you fightin' in school?
- It wasn't my fault. l...

243
00:15:52,244 --> 00:15:56,540
Do not interrupt me when I'm talkin' to you.
Are you crazy? Have you lost your mind?

244
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:59,376
When I'm talkin' to you,
you keep your mouth shut, you hear me?

245
00:16:01,253 --> 00:16:03,755
I had to take off time
from work to pick you up...

246
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,841
'cause you gettin'
suspended from school.

247
00:16:05,924 --> 00:16:09,011
What's the matter with you, huh?
Answer me when I'm talkin' to you.

248
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:11,763
- But you said to keep my mouth shut.
- I know what I said.

249
00:16:11,847 --> 00:16:13,849
I'm talkin' about
when you interrupted me.

250
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:17,561
- Well, I'm confused.
- You confused? You confused?

251
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:21,023
Oh, you gonna be real confused
when I finish with your little butt.

252
00:16:21,106 --> 00:16:26,028
Up there fightin'. What you think?
You think you a man now?

253
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:30,032
<i>You think you a man now
'cause you can ball up your fist and fight?</i>

254
00:16:30,115 --> 00:16:33,160
Actin' like you ain't
got no home trainin'?

255
00:16:33,243 --> 00:16:36,914
Got that white man thinkin' that you ain't
got no sense and I ain't raised you right.

256
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:40,042
What was you fightin' about? Huh?

257
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:43,212
- What was you fightin' about anyway?
- I ain't gonna tell you.

258
00:16:43,295 --> 00:16:45,464
- You ain't gonna what?
- I ain't gonna tell you.

259
00:16:47,466 --> 00:16:51,261
Lord, where is my belt?
Lord, I'm about to kill this boy this morning.

260
00:16:51,303 --> 00:16:55,557
You can whup me if you want to,
but I still ain't gonna tell you.

261
00:16:55,641 --> 00:16:58,227
Lord, give me the strength
to deal with this child this morning.

262
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:03,774
I'm about to send him up to you,
and he gonna be your problem.

263
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:08,237
'Cause this ain't my son talkin' to me like this.
This right here ain't my son.

264
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:20,791
<i>- Somebody get the phone!</i>

265
00:17:21,917 --> 00:17:24,419
<i>Get the phone!
I gotta do everything.</i>

266
00:17:24,503 --> 00:17:28,340
Where is the little cotton-haired girl?
Little OutKast reject.

267
00:17:28,423 --> 00:17:30,467
- Hello, beauty shop.
- Lashaunna...

268
00:17:30,551 --> 00:17:33,136
I'm meeting a lawyer in there
by the name of Michael Edward.

269
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:36,139
<i>- Okay.
- lfhe gets there before I get back,
you take care ofhim?</i>

270
00:17:36,181 --> 00:17:38,141
- All right, cool.
- Thanks.

271
00:17:38,183 --> 00:17:40,185
All right.

272
00:17:40,269 --> 00:17:42,646
Can somebody please get the phone
when the phone is ringin'?

273
00:17:45,566 --> 00:17:49,152
Trey, you lucky I gotta meet somebody
back at the beauty shop.

274
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:54,366
Otherwise, it would be me and you and one
of them switches out there talkin'. Hmm?

275
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:25,355
- Hey, Ricky.
- Huh?

276
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:27,482
Here comes your
little girlfriend.

277
00:18:27,566 --> 00:18:31,236
She's my client, thank you very much.

278
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:35,240
Mm-hmm. That's what your mouth says.
That little bulge in your pants...

279
00:18:35,324 --> 00:18:37,910
that says, "That's my girlfriend.
She's coming."

280
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,331
Goddamn!

281
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:50,172
Whoo-whee!
Goddamn!

282
00:18:50,255 --> 00:18:54,176
<i>Look at this ho...</i>

283
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:57,888
walkin' across the street
like she a superstar.

284
00:18:57,971 --> 00:19:00,682
- Hey, look, can we be a little cordial to my client?
- Please.

285
00:19:00,766 --> 00:19:03,602
She comes here every week.
Can we just not give her a hard time?

286
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:06,897
- Just today? Please? Can we try that?
- Okay. Chill.

287
00:19:06,939 --> 00:19:09,942
<i>Hey! Hey, baby!
Goldilocks!</i>

288
00:19:10,025 --> 00:19:12,069
<i>Over here, baby!</i>

289
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:15,405
Urban renewal!

290
00:19:15,447 --> 00:19:18,909
Come on, y'all. She is a client.
Let's be professional.

291
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:21,411
Personally, I like her.
I ain't gonna give her no hard time.

292
00:19:21,453 --> 00:19:25,749
Me either, Ricky. I don't like her, but I ain't
gonna give her a hard time, just for you.

293
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:27,751
Thank you, Trina.
I appreciate that.

294
00:19:29,378 --> 00:19:31,380
- Hi, guys.
- Hey.

295
00:19:31,463 --> 00:19:33,423
Hey, girl!

296
00:19:33,507 --> 00:19:35,884
- Beeyotch!

297
00:19:35,968 --> 00:19:38,470
<i>Oops, my bad. It slipped.
For real. It really slipped.</i>

298
00:19:38,554 --> 00:19:41,765
- I see nothing's changed.
- Not a damn thing.

299
00:19:41,807 --> 00:19:45,519
Hey, girl. How are you?
How you doin'?

300
00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:47,771
- What up, girl?
- Ooh, look at those pumps.

301
00:19:47,813 --> 00:19:50,524
<i>Honey, they are fierce.
I gotta get me some of those.</i>

302
00:19:50,607 --> 00:19:53,819
Thank you, girl. I just picked these up
last week at Barneys.

303
00:19:53,902 --> 00:19:56,154
Them cheap shoes
ain't from no Barneys.

304
00:19:56,238 --> 00:19:58,699
This is one sharp white woman.

305
00:19:58,782 --> 00:20:00,742
Aw, why, thanks, D.D.

306
00:20:00,826 --> 00:20:04,079
- You're welcome.
- She is so damn sweet!

307
00:20:04,163 --> 00:20:06,790
- Oh!
- Oh, my God! Did she just kiss D.D. on the lips?

308
00:20:06,874 --> 00:20:10,169
So sit down, she.

309
00:20:10,252 --> 00:20:11,920
- Gonna have a cold sore in the mornin'.
- D.D., mmm.

310
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:25,684
So you still not gonna talk?

311
00:20:26,727 --> 00:20:29,479
Fine, don't talk.
Come here.

312
00:20:30,898 --> 00:20:33,108
Now as soon as I finish
handling my business...

313
00:20:33,192 --> 00:20:36,361
oh, I'm gonna handle
some business, all right.

314
00:20:39,198 --> 00:20:41,158
Come on, boy.

315
00:20:43,952 --> 00:20:48,165
Get your little butt in here. Now I want you
to sit in that corner and do your homework...

316
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:51,793
and I don't want to hear another word
out of you, you hear me?

317
00:20:51,835 --> 00:20:53,795
- I said, "Did you hear me?"
- Yes, ma'am.

318
00:20:53,837 --> 00:20:55,881
<i>All right.</i>

319
00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:01,220
- What happened?
- Girl, that boy got suspended from school
today for fightin'.

320
00:21:01,303 --> 00:21:05,682
- For fightin'!
- Oh, come on. He's a boy. That's what boys do.

321
00:21:05,724 --> 00:21:08,352
- Right, big man? What's the big problem?
- I don't condone violence.

322
00:21:08,393 --> 00:21:11,563
Jenny, he's a boy. That's a good sign.
At least he wasn't wearin' a dress...

323
00:21:11,647 --> 00:21:13,982
<i>or talkin'about
buyin'some fierce pumps.</i>

324
00:21:14,066 --> 00:21:16,568
<i>What then?
What ifhe was then, Mr. Man, huh?</i>

325
00:21:16,652 --> 00:21:18,737
Then that's when you'd worry.

326
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:22,658
<i>- Oh, he looks so sad.
- Brenda, don't pamper him.</i>

327
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:24,827
I don't want him to think
what he done was right.

328
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:26,537
- Well, you look mad.
- I am mad.

329
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,872
- I'm so mad I could spit right now.
- Ooh, that's nasty.

330
00:21:28,956 --> 00:21:32,084
<i>- You didn't whup him, did you?
- I was about to tear his little butt up.</i>

331
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:35,671
Holy Toledo.
You guys actually spank your kids?

332
00:21:35,754 --> 00:21:37,881
<i>- "Spank"?
- "Holy Toledo"?</i>

333
00:21:37,965 --> 00:21:41,385
- Did she just say "spank"?
- Hell, yeah, we spank our kids!

334
00:21:41,426 --> 00:21:44,221
Why? I mean, why can't you
just give 'em a time-out?

335
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:47,349
- Time-out?
- Time-out?

336
00:21:47,432 --> 00:21:49,434
- Black folks... we don't give no time-out.
- Okay?

337
00:21:49,518 --> 00:21:52,396
- Stupid.
- What's wrong with you?
The only time-out I had growing up...

338
00:21:52,437 --> 00:21:55,065
was the time my mama took a time-out
from whuppin' my ass.

339
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:57,776
- Right.
- Okay? Okay?

340
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:00,737
<i>Took a break, caught her breath
and started whuppin'my ass again.</i>

341
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:03,073
<i>- Okay? All right?
- Yeah, that is so true.</i>

342
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:05,701
Your mama ever whup you
till she got tired?

343
00:22:05,742 --> 00:22:07,578
<i>- No.
- Hell, yeah! All the time girl!</i>

344
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:10,038
She'd be all out of breath, wheezing.

345
00:22:10,122 --> 00:22:13,041
<i>"Get your little fat ass
over here! I'm gonna get you!"</i>

346
00:22:14,835 --> 00:22:16,837
<i>"You'd better not laugh either,
'cause what's gonna happen?</i>

347
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:20,382
Gonna whup your ass again. Mm-hmm.
One more again. How about that?"

348
00:22:20,465 --> 00:22:22,467
<i>Oh, they'll whup your ass
with all kinds of stuff...</i>

349
00:22:22,551 --> 00:22:24,928
Hot Wheel tracks,
dishrag, electrical cord.

350
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:26,930
<i>What about that, huh?</i>

351
00:22:26,972 --> 00:22:29,641
Make you go outside
and get your own switch.

352
00:22:29,725 --> 00:22:31,560
- Oh, hated that one.
- Are you serious?

353
00:22:31,643 --> 00:22:36,565
- Hell, yeah. That was the worst.
- You got to go out to a bush, grab a branch off...

354
00:22:36,648 --> 00:22:39,067
- so your mama can whup your ass.
- Right.

355
00:22:39,151 --> 00:22:40,819
- For reals?
- Baby, please.

356
00:22:40,903 --> 00:22:42,905
- Better not get one of them little ones either.
- No.

357
00:22:42,946 --> 00:22:45,616
- 'Cause what gonna happen?
- She gonna send you back to get another one.

358
00:22:45,657 --> 00:22:48,160
<i>- Or a couple of'em.
- Okay?</i>

359
00:22:48,243 --> 00:22:51,955
Then she gonna yell out, "You better go ahead
and get the one that I would pick!

360
00:22:51,997 --> 00:22:53,957
<i>You don't want me
to come out there. Okay?"</i>

361
00:22:53,999 --> 00:22:57,586
One time my mama went out there
and whupped my ass with the whole tree.

362
00:22:57,669 --> 00:23:02,299
<i>That's why I don't like trees. You don't see
no bushes, no foliage around my station, okay?</i>

363
00:23:06,261 --> 00:23:08,597
One time I was in church,
just talkin'.

364
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,682
My mama whupped me
with the Bible.

365
00:23:10,766 --> 00:23:14,937
<i>Oh! Hold up. Now, the Bible... I don't think...
I think that's against the rules.</i>

366
00:23:14,978 --> 00:23:17,314
- Your mama was whupping some ass!
- How you gonna whup some...

367
00:23:17,356 --> 00:23:20,150
I'm sittin' and she..."You better be quiet
while you're in church!"

368
00:23:20,192 --> 00:23:22,486
- That man ain't never been to church.
- To this day...

369
00:23:22,569 --> 00:23:25,489
- I will not read nothin'
out of the book of Corinthians.

370
00:23:25,572 --> 00:23:27,950
- Oh, don't stray from the Bible, baby.
- Okay, wait a minute.

371
00:23:27,991 --> 00:23:29,952
Wait a minute.
Isn't that, like, abuse?

372
00:23:29,993 --> 00:23:32,329
- "Abuse"?
- "Abuse."
- No way.

373
00:23:32,412 --> 00:23:36,500
<i>"Abuse"? That's that drownin'shit
y'all white folks do.</i>

374
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:39,127
Okay? Stay away
from the water, baby.

375
00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:41,171
Oh, y'all white folks
kill me with that "abuse."

376
00:23:41,255 --> 00:23:44,299
I mean, we all Americans and everything
like that. We live in the same country.

377
00:23:44,383 --> 00:23:47,469
- Mm-hmm.
- But, uh, culturally, we completely different.

378
00:23:47,553 --> 00:23:51,306
- Definitely.
- Look, I know that I'm the white girl in here, okay?

379
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:54,726
And I'm fully aware of the cultural differences.
But studies have shown...

380
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:58,021
- B-b-baby, "study"? Who's that? Is that a man?
- We don't care about no studies.

381
00:23:58,063 --> 00:24:00,148
- Right.
- You don't care about no studies?

382
00:24:00,232 --> 00:24:03,026
- Studies have shown that kids
that experience paddling...
- "Paddling"?

383
00:24:05,195 --> 00:24:07,865
We don't know nothin' about no paddling,
no boat or nothin' like that.

384
00:24:07,906 --> 00:24:11,743
<i>All we know about is whuppings.
Everybody say it with me.</i>

385
00:24:11,827 --> 00:24:13,745
Whuppings!

386
00:24:13,829 --> 00:24:18,208
Fine. Studies have shown that kids that
experience paddlin', whuppin', whatever...

387
00:24:18,292 --> 00:24:21,170
<i>Physical punishment
among kids...</i>

388
00:24:21,211 --> 00:24:24,173
produces violent behavior
in adolescents.

389
00:24:24,214 --> 00:24:26,717
<i>- You just too deep. You been watchin' "Oprah."
- You know what?</i>

390
00:24:26,758 --> 00:24:29,928
- With all due respect, Tami,
I don't believe those studies.
- Come on.

391
00:24:30,012 --> 00:24:32,723
You don't believe those studies?
Well, it's a scientific fact.

392
00:24:32,806 --> 00:24:36,435
- According to whom?
- According to child psychologists...

393
00:24:36,518 --> 00:24:41,064
people who make it their business to know
and understand children's behavioral patterns.

394
00:24:41,148 --> 00:24:45,194
My mama used to say,
"Spare the rod, spoil the child."

395
00:24:45,235 --> 00:24:47,404
- Your mama was right too, girl.
- Mm-hmm. See?

396
00:24:47,487 --> 00:24:50,908
<i>- Okay, you're my client, all right? And I love you...
- I heard that.</i>

397
00:24:50,991 --> 00:24:53,535
- Quiet.
- That man loves you.
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.

398
00:24:53,619 --> 00:24:57,122
If it wasn't for the fact that my mama gave me
whuppings when I was growing up...

399
00:24:57,206 --> 00:24:59,917
- I'd probably be in jail today, seriously.
- I disagree with you.

400
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,920
<i>Tami, you seem like an educated young woman,
and, you know, that's good.</i>

401
00:25:02,961 --> 00:25:06,173
<i>I know we up in here
speakin'slang and everything...</i>

402
00:25:06,256 --> 00:25:08,300
- but I have a little education myself.
- Come on.

403
00:25:08,383 --> 00:25:11,220
- And I don't believe everything
that's printed in a book.
- Mm-hmm.

404
00:25:11,261 --> 00:25:14,389
You know, I don't know about the focus groups
that are associated with those studies.

405
00:25:14,473 --> 00:25:16,558
- Mm-hmm.
- And quite frankly, I don't think...

406
00:25:16,642 --> 00:25:19,269
that they considered all of the elements
when conducting those experiments.

407
00:25:19,353 --> 00:25:22,481
<i>- Okay? 'Cause, see, I believe that race...
- Right.</i>

408
00:25:22,564 --> 00:25:24,566
- culture, and environment...
- Well.

409
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:27,778
- Preach it, girl.
- have a lot to do with the results of those studies.

410
00:25:27,861 --> 00:25:32,407
- Come on.
- And many of them are made
by white people for white people.

411
00:25:32,491 --> 00:25:34,409
- Come on now! Speak, black woman.
- That's right.

412
00:25:34,493 --> 00:25:37,454
<i>So, until they start
conducting it FUBU style...</i>

413
00:25:37,496 --> 00:25:39,748
that means "for us, by us"...

414
00:25:39,832 --> 00:25:42,084
- Well?
- You see that little boy over there?

415
00:25:42,125 --> 00:25:44,837
- I'm gonna tear his ass up
every time he does wrong.
- How about that?

416
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,965
- Okay, fine!
- You understand? That's my child.

417
00:25:52,845 --> 00:25:54,805
Mmm!

418
00:25:56,348 --> 00:25:58,809
Mmm!

419
00:26:03,146 --> 00:26:06,108
Mmm!

420
00:26:06,149 --> 00:26:08,485
Oh!

421
00:26:09,695 --> 00:26:12,114
My gosh!

422
00:26:13,699 --> 00:26:16,326
Hello, hello.

423
00:26:17,578 --> 00:26:20,205
<i>Hi. Can I help you
with anything?</i>

424
00:26:20,289 --> 00:26:23,959
Yes, I'm here
to see Miss Smithe.

425
00:26:24,001 --> 00:26:28,130
Hello, Michael. I've been expecting you.
Why don't you come back this way.

426
00:26:30,465 --> 00:26:34,052
- So this is the gentleman you've been waiting for.
- Yeah.

427
00:26:34,136 --> 00:26:36,138
Can I get you some cream
with that coffee?

428
00:26:36,221 --> 00:26:38,098
- How are you today?
- I'm well. I'm well.

429
00:26:38,182 --> 00:26:39,975
- Good.
- What's up, dawg?

430
00:26:40,017 --> 00:26:45,147
<i>Ooh! Life is a box of chocolates,
and I think that one got nuts in it.</i>

431
00:26:45,189 --> 00:26:48,692
- Y'all stupid.
- Oh!

432
00:26:48,775 --> 00:26:50,694
Up, up, up, up!

433
00:26:50,777 --> 00:26:52,821
<i>D.D., what are you doin'?</i>

434
00:26:52,905 --> 00:26:56,867
I'm puttin' on my makeup, so I can look my best
when that man come out of there, baby.

435
00:26:56,909 --> 00:26:59,203
<i>Out of control, boo.</i>

436
00:27:01,246 --> 00:27:04,082
<i>Miss Smithe, I don't come
bearing good news.</i>

437
00:27:04,166 --> 00:27:06,919
<i>Apparently, D. W.P. 's
position remains firm.</i>

438
00:27:07,002 --> 00:27:10,547
They intend on moving forth
with their plans of expansion.

439
00:27:10,631 --> 00:27:13,008
Unfortunately for you,
that comes with the cost...

440
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:15,719
of you having to relocate
your business...

441
00:27:15,802 --> 00:27:18,931
and us scheduling
this building for demolition.

442
00:27:19,014 --> 00:27:21,391
So there's nothing
I can do about this?

443
00:27:21,433 --> 00:27:24,728
Well, it appears that eminent domain
does apply under this case.

444
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:28,565
- What's eminent domain?
- You see, the government has the right...

445
00:27:28,649 --> 00:27:31,109
to take private property,
if they so choose...

446
00:27:31,193 --> 00:27:33,570
<i>and use it for public use.</i>

447
00:27:33,612 --> 00:27:35,906
This building has sentimental value.

448
00:27:35,989 --> 00:27:37,908
It's been in my family for years.

449
00:27:37,991 --> 00:27:41,537
Yes, but the government
is not concerned with that.

450
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:44,540
I see.

451
00:27:44,581 --> 00:27:47,793
Eminent domain, huh?

452
00:27:47,876 --> 00:27:50,754
Just another fancy word to explain
that the government is takin' my building...

453
00:27:50,838 --> 00:27:52,756
and puttin' me out of business.

454
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:56,093
Miss Smithe,
if it's any consolation...

455
00:27:56,176 --> 00:27:59,930
- I feel deeply for you and your situation.
- Yeah, you already said that.

456
00:27:59,972 --> 00:28:02,558
And against
my better judgment...

457
00:28:02,641 --> 00:28:06,645
I persuaded my client to reimburse you
an additional 10%...

458
00:28:06,728 --> 00:28:11,650
<i>making the value of the property
and your combined relocation fee
to be a 130% of market value.</i>

459
00:28:11,733 --> 00:28:16,738
Well, that's awfully nice
of you, Mr. Edward...

460
00:28:16,822 --> 00:28:20,075
coming down here
in your Armani suit.

461
00:28:20,117 --> 00:28:22,327
But let me tell you somethin'.

462
00:28:22,411 --> 00:28:25,414
There's no consolation for
uprooting me from my business...

463
00:28:25,455 --> 00:28:28,458
just because you guys want
to build a bigger parking lot.

464
00:28:31,712 --> 00:28:34,840
Yes, well, I see you have
the other check over there.

465
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:40,637
Here's the additional $25,000.

466
00:28:42,639 --> 00:28:46,310
Once again, I apologize
for the inconvenience.

467
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:50,689
- Hey, yo, check out this right here!
- Yeah, man!

468
00:28:50,772 --> 00:28:53,275
Make that thing hop!

469
00:28:55,569 --> 00:28:57,487
- Yeah! Here we go!
- Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

470
00:29:01,533 --> 00:29:04,119
This is the part of my job
that I don't enjoy.

471
00:29:04,203 --> 00:29:06,830
So believe me when I tell you
I feel for you.

472
00:29:06,914 --> 00:29:09,875
I don't mean
to sound harsh, Mr. Edward...

473
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:13,420
but your feeling for me isn't
gonna help my situation any.

474
00:29:13,504 --> 00:29:17,674
I need help. So why don't you get in
your nice little sports car...

475
00:29:17,758 --> 00:29:20,219
and go back to your big cases
and your big clients.

476
00:29:20,302 --> 00:29:23,138
- Window!
- Look, I know you not touching me!
You better get off!

477
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:25,349
<i>What do you think they talkin'about?
- It'll be all right.</i>

478
00:29:25,432 --> 00:29:29,311
I'm sure it won't take you long to forget
about me and my little beauty shop here.

479
00:29:30,687 --> 00:29:34,066
Why don't you just go? Go.

480
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:37,152
Well, I'm sorry.

481
00:29:55,087 --> 00:29:59,675
- Here she comes!
- Just act normal. Oh, I forgot you gay.

482
00:29:59,758 --> 00:30:01,760
Shut up, Nemo.

483
00:30:05,931 --> 00:30:08,976
Shh, shh, shh, shh!

484
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:30,581
- Jenny, girl, that man sure was fine! Mmm!
- Mmm!

485
00:30:30,664 --> 00:30:33,208
Is he married?
Does he have a girlfriend?

486
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:35,502
Why you asking?
That ain't never stopped you before.

487
00:30:35,586 --> 00:30:38,589
- Hey, you right.
- I'm not sure he got somebody,
but he wasn't my type.

488
00:30:38,672 --> 00:30:40,966
- Ooh, ooh, hey! G-G-Girl, can I have him?
- D.D.

489
00:30:41,049 --> 00:30:44,803
Look, I saw him first.
What does he do? Is he rich?

490
00:30:44,887 --> 00:30:47,806
Will you vultures back off? Damn!

491
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:50,100
Can't you see she's upset?

492
00:30:50,142 --> 00:30:52,144
What's the matter, Jen?
What'd he want?

493
00:30:52,227 --> 00:30:54,605
Oh, girl, just nonsense.
Nothing for y'all to worry about.

494
00:30:54,646 --> 00:30:58,442
No. For real though,
that man was fine. I mean fine.

495
00:30:58,525 --> 00:31:01,278
I don't look at other men.
I only see Patrick.

496
00:31:01,361 --> 00:31:03,572
- Patrick?
- That's my man.

497
00:31:03,614 --> 00:31:05,741
Girl, please.
Tami, what you think, honey?

498
00:31:05,824 --> 00:31:07,784
- Oh, me?
- Mm-hmm.

499
00:31:07,868 --> 00:31:12,748
- Definitely a looker. Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, and I don't like the way
you was looking at him either.

500
00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:14,791
What, I can't admire him too
just because I'm white?

501
00:31:14,875 --> 00:31:17,419
- No, you can't.
- Oh, that's some bullshit.

502
00:31:17,461 --> 00:31:19,796
Ooh!

503
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:24,468
What? I am so tired of black women
telling me who I can and can't date.

504
00:31:24,551 --> 00:31:28,805
I hear you all talk in here. "Oh, the black men
are only with the white women...

505
00:31:28,889 --> 00:31:31,934
- 'cause they all easy and docile and submissive."
- Well, you are.

506
00:31:31,975 --> 00:31:34,811
I mean, please. All right?
Those days are done.

507
00:31:34,895 --> 00:31:38,815
- We have just as much sass and attitude as y'all do.
- But not ass though.

508
00:31:38,857 --> 00:31:41,151
- Real flat. It's real flat.
- I didn't say that.

509
00:31:41,235 --> 00:31:43,654
<i>- Had to get you.
- I'll give you that one.</i>

510
00:31:43,737 --> 00:31:47,491
But I'm serious. I mean, when I walk
down the street with a brother...

511
00:31:47,533 --> 00:31:50,828
all I get are harsh looks
from the sisters...

512
00:31:50,869 --> 00:31:54,331
who are obviously trying
to display their disapproval.

513
00:31:54,373 --> 00:31:56,917
I mean, how is that any different
from rednecks in the South...

514
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,711
when they judge people
by the color of their skin, huh?

515
00:31:59,795 --> 00:32:03,715
- I mean, I'm sick of it all.
- Well, if you so sick of it, stop doing it.

516
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:05,968
Hey, hey, hey! Hold up.
This is my client now.

517
00:32:06,009 --> 00:32:09,137
Whatever. I really don't care. Know what?
Let me just break it down to you.

518
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:13,141
<i>The reason why black women don't like
to see white women with black men...</i>

519
00:32:13,225 --> 00:32:16,061
is because there are not
enough black men to go around.

520
00:32:16,144 --> 00:32:19,898
And then we gotta
share them with y'all? Oh, hell, no!

521
00:32:19,982 --> 00:32:23,902
<i>Look, I know I'm supposed to be Miss Docile
White Woman in the beauty shop...</i>

522
00:32:23,986 --> 00:32:25,988
but I am not havin' this, okay?

523
00:32:26,029 --> 00:32:28,073
I'm gonna tell you
exactly what I think.

524
00:32:28,157 --> 00:32:31,368
Black men are not a commodity.

525
00:32:31,451 --> 00:32:33,579
You don't own them.
They're not yours.

526
00:32:33,662 --> 00:32:36,081
- They don't belong to you.
- Oh, Jesus!

527
00:32:36,165 --> 00:32:39,168
<i>All right? And another thing...
They have a choice in the matter.</i>

528
00:32:39,251 --> 00:32:41,211
I can't help it if they choose me.

529
00:32:41,253 --> 00:32:44,047
Well, that... You know, that's because
y'all make it real easy.

530
00:32:44,131 --> 00:32:48,719
Just be throwin' it all up in a brother's face,
makin' it harder for us black women.

531
00:32:48,802 --> 00:32:51,013
<i>- Hold on. Hold on. Wait. Whoa. Wait a minute.
- Sistas!</i>

532
00:32:51,054 --> 00:32:54,516
Y'all know that's not true, 'cause some of y'all
be throwin' it up on the first date.

533
00:32:54,558 --> 00:32:58,187
- Mm-hmm. Thank you.
- Uh, Lashaunna. So it ain't just white women.

534
00:32:58,270 --> 00:33:01,607
You know what? I don't care.
I'm just real sick of y'all white bitches.

535
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:05,235
- Oh, Trina!
- What? Well, she's a bitch. What?

536
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:07,863
<i>- Oh, no. You did not just say that.
- Yeah I did.</i>

537
00:33:07,905 --> 00:33:10,240
I ain't gonna be too many
more white bitches, okay?

538
00:33:10,324 --> 00:33:13,452
You say you can fight?
I'm about to make you prove that.

539
00:33:13,535 --> 00:33:17,080
- Say what?
- Uh, the white girl says she ain't havin' it.

540
00:33:17,164 --> 00:33:19,041
- That's exactly what I said.
- What did you say?

541
00:33:19,082 --> 00:33:22,252
- You heard me!
- What? Girl, I will hurt you!

542
00:33:22,336 --> 00:33:26,423
- Do you know I will hurt you? I will hurt you!
- Hey, Trina, chill!

543
00:33:27,508 --> 00:33:29,927
Now, look, y'all,
this is my beauty shop.

544
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:32,387
- And she's right. She is a client, so...
- I'm fine.

545
00:33:32,429 --> 00:33:35,891
- I'm fine.
- Come on. She comin' down
to our hood, runnin' her mouth.

546
00:33:35,974 --> 00:33:37,935
How's that any different
than anybody else?

547
00:33:37,976 --> 00:33:40,312
- Shoot, everybody be running
their mouth up in here.
- Exactly.

548
00:33:40,395 --> 00:33:43,899
Well, it's because she's white,
and I'm fittin' to whup her ass!

549
00:33:43,982 --> 00:33:47,945
- You're gonna whup my ass?
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!

550
00:33:47,986 --> 00:33:50,280
Girl, you are not gonna
whup my ass. You know why?

551
00:33:50,322 --> 00:33:54,576
Because that would be a job for a super bitch.
And you... you're just a regular bitch.

552
00:34:02,251 --> 00:34:05,838
Put them scissors down!
Put them scissors down!

553
00:34:05,921 --> 00:34:09,174
Oh, damn!

554
00:34:10,676 --> 00:34:13,178
Hey! She got you,
all right?

555
00:34:13,262 --> 00:34:17,099
<i>All right. You just go back to your station
and chill, missy. Live to fight another day.</i>

556
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:20,477
All right. You got that one.

557
00:34:20,519 --> 00:34:22,479
<i>- That was a good one.
- That was good.</i>

558
00:34:22,521 --> 00:34:24,815
I still don't like your ass,
but that was pretty good.

559
00:34:24,898 --> 00:34:27,150
- Yeah, one for the white girl.
- Chill.

560
00:34:27,234 --> 00:34:29,361
- Tami don't play.
- "Tami don't play."

561
00:34:29,444 --> 00:34:33,282
- Tami don't play, mm-mmm
Tami don't play, mm-mmm
- Girl, sit down.

562
00:34:36,034 --> 00:34:37,452
Oh!

563
00:34:37,494 --> 00:34:39,538
What's that?

564
00:34:39,621 --> 00:34:41,874
Oh, man!

565
00:34:41,957 --> 00:34:43,834
<i>Damn.</i>

566
00:34:43,917 --> 00:34:46,670
- Oh, no.
- I knew something like that was gonna happen.

567
00:34:46,753 --> 00:34:49,339
<i>How long we been beggin'them
to put a light right there?</i>

568
00:34:49,423 --> 00:34:52,092
- Okay. Too long.
- Forever.

569
00:34:52,176 --> 00:34:54,928
Just another example how we can't get
nothin' done in our neighborhood.

570
00:34:55,012 --> 00:34:57,472
- Okay.
- Government don't care nothin' 'bout us.

571
00:35:01,185 --> 00:35:04,313
I seen it, man!
I seen the whole thing!

572
00:35:04,354 --> 00:35:07,149
I seen it all!
He come out!

573
00:35:07,191 --> 00:35:10,319
He came around
and then boom!

574
00:35:10,402 --> 00:35:12,988
Hit him! He hit him!

575
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:16,366
- Be a kid next time.
- You ain't lyin'. That truck is big too.

576
00:35:16,408 --> 00:35:20,537
You goin' to jail!
And you goin' to jail too!

577
00:35:20,621 --> 00:35:22,664
Simple as that!

578
00:35:22,706 --> 00:35:24,708
What you got in here?

579
00:35:43,143 --> 00:35:45,354
Mike?

580
00:35:45,395 --> 00:35:47,523
<i>- Hey. Mike, how'd it go?
- Fine.</i>

581
00:35:47,564 --> 00:35:51,401
- Everything work out?
- Yep. Everything's cool. Just great.

582
00:35:51,443 --> 00:35:55,197
All right.
So... what's the problem?

583
00:35:55,239 --> 00:35:59,952
I don't know, Bob. It's just that sometimes
always bein' the bad guy gets to me. That's all.

584
00:36:00,035 --> 00:36:03,956
Oh. It's thatJenny girl, isn't it?

585
00:36:04,039 --> 00:36:06,458
You like her.

586
00:36:06,542 --> 00:36:10,337
<i>Mike, look.
Lawyer rule number one:</i>

587
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:13,924
Don't get emotionally involved with the issues
of the clients. Don't get confused.

588
00:36:14,007 --> 00:36:16,552
We represent the government and
the interest of the D.W.P. here.

589
00:36:16,635 --> 00:36:19,096
<i>- They're the guys that pay the bills.
- What about the little guy?</i>

590
00:36:19,179 --> 00:36:23,392
What about the little guy? Look, I don't
disagree with you. Sometimes life isn't fair.

591
00:36:23,433 --> 00:36:26,436
But we got a job to do.
We took an oath. We're lawyers.

592
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:29,314
<i>We protect our clients at all costs,
even ifhe is the big guy.</i>

593
00:36:29,398 --> 00:36:31,608
And what if what
the big guy is doing is wrong?

594
00:36:31,692 --> 00:36:36,446
- Well, you know, then you've got a moral dilemma.

595
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:41,285
And she's probably a very nice
moral dilemma to have. Mike?

596
00:36:41,326 --> 00:36:43,287
Mike?

597
00:36:43,328 --> 00:36:45,289
Look at me.

598
00:36:46,832 --> 00:36:48,959
I'm your friend.

599
00:36:49,042 --> 00:36:52,588
- Don't you do whatever it is
you're thinkin' about doing.
- Don't do what?

600
00:36:52,671 --> 00:36:56,758
I don't know what,
but don't do it. I know you.

601
00:36:56,842 --> 00:37:02,139
You're playing with fire here, and he who
plays with fire gets burnt. So don't do it!

602
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:05,475
- All right?

603
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:09,855
- Yeah.
- You're right.

604
00:37:09,938 --> 00:37:12,107
- Yeah.
- You're right. I'm trippin'.

605
00:37:12,149 --> 00:37:14,151
- You're trippin'?
- I'm trippin'.

606
00:37:14,234 --> 00:37:17,321
You're all... You mean like...
like trippin', okay.

607
00:37:19,656 --> 00:37:23,327
- What was I thinking?
- I don't know. I don't know
what you were thinking.

608
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:26,121
<i>Are you thinking now?
Yeah, good. Don't think.</i>

609
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:35,631
Hey! Hey, girl!

610
00:37:35,672 --> 00:37:37,883
Ha! Hey, girl!

611
00:37:37,966 --> 00:37:42,304
<i>You're out here working
kinda early this morning, ain't ya?</i>

612
00:37:42,346 --> 00:37:46,141
Hey, y'all some
hardworking bitches!

613
00:37:46,183 --> 00:37:49,686
- Just move!
- Hey, hey, baby, come here.
Look, look. Look here, baby.

614
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:51,772
I got...

615
00:37:53,065 --> 00:37:56,318
I got 75 cents right here.
What's that get me?

616
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,320
- An ass whuppin'.
- An ass whuppin'.

617
00:37:58,362 --> 00:38:00,989
Oh, baby, come on. Seventy-five cents
ought to get me somethin'.

618
00:38:01,073 --> 00:38:05,077
- A feel or somethin'.
- You better not let our pimp
catch you talkin' to us.

619
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,830
- He will whup your drunk ass. So just move!
- Oh!

620
00:38:07,871 --> 00:38:09,998
- Girl, come on.
- I ain't scared!

621
00:38:10,082 --> 00:38:15,045
Hey, I get a fifth of liquor
in me, and I got no fear!

622
00:38:15,128 --> 00:38:18,507
No fear whatsoever!
Come on! I'll bring my... Ow!

623
00:38:18,549 --> 00:38:20,926
- Y'all be glue, man!
- Keep talkin'!

624
00:38:21,009 --> 00:38:24,388
I don't want your
old stinky tail anyway!

625
00:38:24,471 --> 00:38:27,015
I'm on my way out to the club
last weekend, about to...

626
00:38:27,057 --> 00:38:29,768
<i>get my groove on, when I noticed
my gas tank was almost empty.</i>

627
00:38:29,852 --> 00:38:32,729
So I pulled up to the full-service side
of this gas station.

628
00:38:32,771 --> 00:38:37,442
I sit in my car and I wait,
and I wait, and I wait.

629
00:38:37,526 --> 00:38:40,237
<i>I can't understand for the life of me
why the gas serving attendant...</i>

630
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,866
is takin' so long, since I'm the only
car that's there.

631
00:38:43,949 --> 00:38:47,536
Well, you know me, baby.
I refuse to be disrespected, okay?

632
00:38:47,578 --> 00:38:51,290
<i>I get out of my car, walk into the gas station,
and there was this redneck there...</i>

633
00:38:51,373 --> 00:38:54,209
foot up on the counter,
pickin' his nose, watchin' TV.

634
00:38:54,251 --> 00:38:57,880
- That's nasty.
- So, I said...

635
00:38:57,963 --> 00:39:02,926
"Excuse me, but I have been
waiting quite some time for service."

636
00:39:02,968 --> 00:39:05,304
And this fool had the nerve
to say to me...

637
00:39:05,387 --> 00:39:07,431
"I don't pump gas for faggots."

638
00:39:07,514 --> 00:39:09,474
Ooh! D.D., what did you do?

639
00:39:09,558 --> 00:39:11,768
Girl, almost went postal
up in that place.

640
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:14,146
'Cause you know, I was not
takin' that. Like Mama said...

641
00:39:14,229 --> 00:39:17,232
- "Don't start no 'sh,' and there won't be no 'it."'
- That's right.

642
00:39:17,274 --> 00:39:19,359
Girl, I turned around,
put my hands on my hip...

643
00:39:19,443 --> 00:39:22,154
and I stared at him dead in his
bloodshot eyes and I said...

644
00:39:22,237 --> 00:39:25,240
I bet that scared him to death.

645
00:39:25,282 --> 00:39:27,451
And I said, "Let me
tell you something...

646
00:39:27,534 --> 00:39:30,204
"you overall wearin',
rotten-tooth redneck.

647
00:39:30,287 --> 00:39:33,248
"You can sit there with your
five-dollar-an-hour job, pickin' your nose...

648
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:36,126
"thinkin' you better than somebody,
but let me tell you somethin'.

649
00:39:36,168 --> 00:39:39,963
"I will buy you, sell you and then throw away
the change. Up there, calling me a faggot.

650
00:39:40,005 --> 00:39:43,675
"I'm more man than you will ever be and more
woman than you will ever hope to get.

651
00:39:43,759 --> 00:39:46,470
- What? Take it. Rrrrr!"
- Whoo!

652
00:39:46,553 --> 00:39:48,597
<i>Rrrrr! Yes, yes.</i>

653
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:51,600
- Okay, and then what'd you do?
- Girl, I ran.

654
00:39:51,642 --> 00:39:55,270
<i>Jethro reached from under that counter
with that big old gun, and I was out of there.</i>

655
00:39:55,312 --> 00:39:59,149
I'm tellin' you, America is not as liberal
as we think we are. Turn around, baby.

656
00:39:59,191 --> 00:40:03,320
<i>- We have a long way to go.
- Lord, yes.</i>

657
00:40:03,403 --> 00:40:05,948
That's true.

658
00:40:06,031 --> 00:40:10,327
- Hey, Jenny, can I talk to you for a minute?
- Yeah.

659
00:40:10,369 --> 00:40:12,955
- Outside?
- Sure.

660
00:40:12,996 --> 00:40:14,957
Jethro.

661
00:40:14,998 --> 00:40:19,002
"Look here, Fruity Pebbles, pump your own gas."

662
00:40:19,086 --> 00:40:22,840
- Takes one to know one.
Been called by better. Mm-hmm.

663
00:40:22,881 --> 00:40:24,967
What's up?

664
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:27,135
- All right. What's goin' on?
- What?

665
00:40:27,219 --> 00:40:30,222
Come on. Now, you can fool
the others in there, but you can't fool me.

666
00:40:30,305 --> 00:40:34,017
Now, ever since that pretty boy came by,
you ain't been actin' right.

667
00:40:34,101 --> 00:40:36,228
What's up, Jen?

668
00:40:38,605 --> 00:40:41,024
Lashaunna, that guy's a lawyer
representin' the D.W. P"..."

669
00:40:41,066 --> 00:40:44,653
- and he just told me that we gonna have to move.
- What?

670
00:40:44,736 --> 00:40:47,656
The government wants to tear down
the building and turn it into a parkin' lot.

671
00:40:47,698 --> 00:40:50,242
- And ain't nothing we can do about it.
- Say what?

672
00:40:50,325 --> 00:40:52,619
Yeah.
Now, they gonna hook me up.

673
00:40:52,703 --> 00:40:55,664
They gonna pay me... quite well,
as a matter of fact...

674
00:40:55,747 --> 00:40:58,542
<i>- but the bad part is...
- Hey, SisterJenny!</i>

675
00:40:58,584 --> 00:41:02,087
<i>- Hey, Reverend. How you doin'?
- Good. Missed you
at Empowerment Temple Sunday.</i>

676
00:41:02,171 --> 00:41:05,048
I had to handle some business with the shop.
I'll be back next week.

677
00:41:05,132 --> 00:41:07,176
- All right. I'm holding a seat for you.
- All right.

678
00:41:07,217 --> 00:41:10,679
- All right. Have a good one.
- The bad part is...

679
00:41:10,762 --> 00:41:13,348
<i>Hey, Jenny!
What's up, baby?</i>

680
00:41:13,432 --> 00:41:17,519
- How you doin'?
- You on a diet? You just don't
want this chocolate no more?

681
00:41:17,561 --> 00:41:19,563
Boy, go on somewhere. Keep it movin'.

682
00:41:19,646 --> 00:41:21,565
Girl, for you, I'd take this ring off!

683
00:41:21,648 --> 00:41:23,859
<i>- All right, baby.
- That's all he takin'off.</i>

684
00:41:23,901 --> 00:41:28,071
<i>- Holler at your boy!
- The bad part is, I almost wanna do it.</i>

685
00:41:28,155 --> 00:41:30,365
- Oh.
- I mean, look how we livin' up here.

686
00:41:30,407 --> 00:41:33,744
<i>Pimps up, hos down, bums.</i>

687
00:41:33,827 --> 00:41:36,622
My son is having
trouble in school.

688
00:41:36,705 --> 00:41:39,708
What the hell am I fightin' for?
What am I fightin' for?

689
00:41:41,043 --> 00:41:43,795
Nobody else seems to care.
Why should I?

690
00:41:43,879 --> 00:41:46,256
'Cause you can.

691
00:41:46,298 --> 00:41:49,635
Now, you have an opportunity,
with this shop, to make a difference.

692
00:41:49,718 --> 00:41:52,137
Okay, how many black people
you know own their own business?

693
00:41:52,221 --> 00:41:55,641
How many black women you know that can
provide honest employment for eight people?

694
00:41:55,724 --> 00:41:58,477
Oh, no, you right.
This is a raggedy neighborhood.

695
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:01,563
We got pimps and hos
and buildings falling down.

696
00:42:01,647 --> 00:42:03,607
But it's ours.

697
00:42:03,649 --> 00:42:06,610
And if we can fight for it,
we should.

698
00:42:08,028 --> 00:42:10,489
What you gonna do?

699
00:42:12,699 --> 00:42:14,618
I don't know.

700
00:42:17,162 --> 00:42:20,040
But do me a favor.
Keep this between me and you.

701
00:42:20,123 --> 00:42:22,167
I ain't gonna stress
the others out with this.

702
00:42:22,251 --> 00:42:24,169
I'll figure out somethin'.

703
00:42:24,253 --> 00:42:26,296
All right, girl.

704
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:29,633
<i>What up, Lashaunna?</i>

705
00:42:29,716 --> 00:42:32,261
- What up, Jenny?
- Hey, Percy.

706
00:42:32,302 --> 00:42:34,513
My two favorite women
in the whole wide world.

707
00:42:34,596 --> 00:42:38,308
Y'all like my little
adopted granddaughters.

708
00:42:38,392 --> 00:42:41,144
Uh-oh. What you doin' outside?
Get back to work.

709
00:42:41,186 --> 00:42:43,981
- Make me some money.
- All right. We be in.

710
00:42:44,147 --> 00:42:45,983
All right.

711
00:42:46,024 --> 00:42:48,944
Well, look what the cat done drug in.

712
00:42:48,986 --> 00:42:53,115
Well, if it isn't that little sweet boy.
Boy got sugar in his blood.

713
00:42:53,198 --> 00:42:56,702
- A little sugar ain't never hurt nobody.
- In that case, I am diabetic.

714
00:42:56,785 --> 00:42:59,163
- Me too!
- I bet you is.

715
00:42:59,204 --> 00:43:03,208
<i>- Percy.
- Oh, Nefertiti.</i>

716
00:43:03,292 --> 00:43:05,544
I'm in love again.

717
00:43:05,627 --> 00:43:09,173
Yo. What up, junior?
What you sittin' in the corner all quiet for?

718
00:43:09,256 --> 00:43:11,800
- 'Cause I'm on punishment.
- For what? What'd you do?

719
00:43:11,884 --> 00:43:14,469
- Fightin'.
- Did you win?

720
00:43:14,553 --> 00:43:17,389
- Yeah.
- Then that's all that matters then.

721
00:43:17,472 --> 00:43:19,892
Percy!

722
00:43:19,975 --> 00:43:23,061
<i>- Don't be teaching my son no bad habits now.
- Aw, Jenny.</i>

723
00:43:23,145 --> 00:43:26,023
<i>- Let the boy be a boy.
- That's what I said, P-Funk.</i>

724
00:43:26,064 --> 00:43:29,359
<i>That's not what you said. You said
somethin'else. But I know your little secret.</i>

725
00:43:29,443 --> 00:43:33,071
- What secret?
- Your little secret.

726
00:43:33,155 --> 00:43:35,073
- You'd better...

727
00:43:35,157 --> 00:43:37,826
<i>- I'm gonna tell you, I'm gonna hurt him.
- Ooh.</i>

728
00:43:37,868 --> 00:43:43,081
- So, Brenda, talk to me.
- Talk to you about what, Percy?

729
00:43:43,165 --> 00:43:46,043
- You still with that no-good boy at the gas station?

730
00:43:46,126 --> 00:43:48,170
Percy, not today, all right?

731
00:43:48,212 --> 00:43:50,714
What you mean by "not today"?
It's gonna be today...

732
00:43:50,756 --> 00:43:53,008
<i>and every other day
till you get rid ofhim.</i>

733
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:55,177
- Right.
- You put up with all his garbage, don't you?

734
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:58,847
Percy, can we talk about somethin'
other than my personal business, please?

735
00:43:58,931 --> 00:44:01,350
He done whipped it on you, didn't he?

736
00:44:01,391 --> 00:44:03,519
- Percy!

737
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:06,230
That's the "onliest" time...
When a woman act like this...

738
00:44:06,313 --> 00:44:08,732
<i>puttin'up with all kinds
of crazy stuff...</i>

739
00:44:08,774 --> 00:44:10,859
- that's when a man done whipped it on you.
- Right.

740
00:44:10,943 --> 00:44:13,779
- Otherwise you would've been done
and left him a long time ago.
- That's true.

741
00:44:13,862 --> 00:44:15,572
- It's not true.
- It is true.

742
00:44:15,656 --> 00:44:17,616
It is true, Brenda,
and you know it's true.

743
00:44:17,699 --> 00:44:22,079
<i>That boy must got somethin'serious
goin'on, 'cause he ain't got nothin'else.</i>

744
00:44:22,162 --> 00:44:24,039
Okay. Keep it real.
Tell the truth.

745
00:44:24,081 --> 00:44:29,711
What is that bomb they use in the Iraq War
to hit somethin' deep in the ground...

746
00:44:29,795 --> 00:44:32,589
- to go to the bottom of the buildin'?
- Uh, the bunker buster.

747
00:44:32,673 --> 00:44:37,219
- Ah! That boy must got that
bunker buster in his pants.
- Bam!

748
00:44:37,261 --> 00:44:40,389
<i>lfhe's happy with you, he's knocked
the bottom out of your buildin'.</i>

749
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:44,309
<i>- Yes, sir!
- Got that bunker buster lovin'.</i>

750
00:44:44,393 --> 00:44:48,146
Put you on "shock and awe" campaign.

751
00:44:51,483 --> 00:44:53,443
I got your shock and awe.

752
00:44:53,527 --> 00:44:56,238
Ooh!

753
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:58,782
Percy, you know you're a fool.
Sit in on down now.

754
00:44:58,824 --> 00:45:02,161
I'd knock me out.

755
00:45:02,244 --> 00:45:04,454
That's my man right there.
That's my ace.

756
00:45:04,496 --> 00:45:06,582
How's daddy?
Go ahead, man.

757
00:45:06,623 --> 00:45:08,500
<i>Okay. See you later.</i>

758
00:45:08,584 --> 00:45:13,297
<i>- Bunker buster, I tell you.
- Oh, you're goin'?</i>

759
00:45:13,338 --> 00:45:15,591
Ah-ah-ah. Where you goin'?
Where you goin'?

760
00:45:15,632 --> 00:45:18,135
<i>It ain't even 12:00.
Where you fittin'to go and shack up?</i>

761
00:45:18,177 --> 00:45:19,970
- Ooh.
- Percy, mind your business.

762
00:45:20,053 --> 00:45:24,683
- Where your wife at?
- What you mean where my wife at?
She's in her skin. What?

763
00:45:24,766 --> 00:45:26,310
<i>Uh-uh.</i>

764
00:45:26,393 --> 00:45:29,229
Dang! Where is Afro girl at?

765
00:45:29,313 --> 00:45:31,773
Hello. Beauty shop.
This is D.D.

766
00:45:31,815 --> 00:45:34,818
Just one second.
Jenny, for you.

767
00:45:36,737 --> 00:45:39,448
Girl, it's a man. Yeah.

768
00:45:39,490 --> 00:45:42,701
Stop. Hello?

769
00:45:42,784 --> 00:45:44,953
Miss Smithe, Michael Edward here.
How are you?

770
00:45:45,037 --> 00:45:47,039
Fine.

771
00:45:47,122 --> 00:45:49,666
I thought about what you said earlier,
about needing help.

772
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:53,045
And, um, against
my better judgment...

773
00:45:53,128 --> 00:45:55,130
I've... I've decided
to inform you...

774
00:45:55,172 --> 00:45:59,510
that there, in fact, is a final hearing today
at 3:00 before the city review board...

775
00:45:59,593 --> 00:46:01,512
regarding your issue.

776
00:46:01,595 --> 00:46:07,142
Now, traditionally, the review board
is really just a... a formality...

777
00:46:07,226 --> 00:46:12,189
but you can show up and plead your case
in front of them if you'd like.

778
00:46:12,272 --> 00:46:16,026
Me being opposing counsel, well...

779
00:46:16,068 --> 00:46:19,988
- I won't object to it.
- You'd do that for me?

780
00:46:21,698 --> 00:46:24,993
Now, Miss Smithe,
now I'm not promising anything...

781
00:46:25,035 --> 00:46:27,996
and quite frankly,
I think it's a waste of time.

782
00:46:28,038 --> 00:46:31,667
But, um, yes, I'd do that for you.

783
00:46:32,709 --> 00:46:35,170
- Thank you, Michael.
- You're welcome.

784
00:46:36,839 --> 00:46:39,299
Hey, um, Michael...

785
00:46:39,383 --> 00:46:42,135
Iook, I was wondering, um...

786
00:46:42,219 --> 00:46:46,056
I'm about to go to lunch in about an hour.
Would you care to join me?

787
00:46:47,349 --> 00:46:49,852
- Miss Smithe...
- Call meJenny.

788
00:46:51,728 --> 00:46:54,398
Okay, Jenny.

789
00:46:54,481 --> 00:46:56,567
I don't think
that's a good idea.

790
00:46:58,485 --> 00:47:00,863
As a matter of fact,
I think it's a bad idea.

791
00:47:00,904 --> 00:47:02,906
But, um...

792
00:47:04,783 --> 00:47:06,952
yeah, I'd...
I'd like to join you.

793
00:47:12,875 --> 00:47:17,629
Whoo! Oh, my gosh!
My feet are killin' me.

794
00:47:17,713 --> 00:47:20,090
And we just started our day.

795
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:27,639
Trey, come here, baby.

796
00:47:27,723 --> 00:47:29,892
<i>Did you get some
of your homework done?</i>

797
00:47:29,933 --> 00:47:32,561
- Yes, ma'am.
- Why don't you finish
the rest upstairs for me, all right?

798
00:47:32,644 --> 00:47:35,981
- Okay.
- All right. I need to holler at you for a minute.

799
00:47:36,064 --> 00:47:38,567
<i>Well, if it isn't
the ladies of the night.</i>

800
00:47:38,609 --> 00:47:41,570
- Or sometimes, the afternoon.

801
00:47:41,612 --> 00:47:43,614
What's goin' on, y'all?

802
00:47:43,697 --> 00:47:46,325
- Oh, honey, we just came in here
to get off our feet.
- Ooh!

803
00:47:46,408 --> 00:47:49,244
I thought that was your job, to get off your feet.

804
00:47:49,286 --> 00:47:51,914
<i>Mmm! And be on your back.</i>

805
00:47:51,955 --> 00:47:55,000
Uh-uh. Peaches, did you hear
somebody talking to us?

806
00:47:55,083 --> 00:47:57,753
<i>- Nope.
- See, now you know what?</i>

807
00:47:57,794 --> 00:48:00,088
That's funny...

808
00:48:00,130 --> 00:48:03,800
'cause I thought I heard the voice of D.D.,
that old doo-doo chaser.

809
00:48:03,884 --> 00:48:05,802
Oh, damn!

810
00:48:05,886 --> 00:48:08,931
Oh, you did not just go there.
Miss Thing did not go there.

811
00:48:08,972 --> 00:48:10,849
- Sounds to me like she did.
- Me too.

812
00:48:10,933 --> 00:48:15,270
<i>Uh-uh. Let me tell you something,
Miss Skank Number One and Skank Number Two.</i>

813
00:48:15,312 --> 00:48:18,106
- What you got to say, D.D.?
- Bring it.

814
00:48:18,148 --> 00:48:22,611
All right, toucan tuna, you both look like little
"la poubelles." All right, baby?

815
00:48:22,653 --> 00:48:26,657
He called to tell me that I should come
to a review board hearing today at 3:00.

816
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:29,660
Now, I really shouldn't come
because it's just a formality...

817
00:48:29,701 --> 00:48:32,329
but, uh, he stuck
his neck out for me.

818
00:48:32,412 --> 00:48:34,623
Okay, good.
That's a good thing.

819
00:48:34,665 --> 00:48:37,960
Yeah, but then
I invited him to lunch.

820
00:48:38,001 --> 00:48:41,463
Uh, how long you known this guy?

821
00:48:41,505 --> 00:48:43,465
About a month now.

822
00:48:43,507 --> 00:48:46,844
I've been seein' him on and off,
you know, about the case.

823
00:48:46,885 --> 00:48:50,514
But this time, I felt a little personal.

824
00:48:50,597 --> 00:48:53,517
- I think you like him.
- Is that a crime?

825
00:48:53,559 --> 00:48:56,854
I don't know.
It just seems like a sticky situation.

826
00:48:56,895 --> 00:49:00,691
- But you know what? Go to your little lunch.
- Thank you.

827
00:49:00,774 --> 00:49:04,486
Hey, well, don't let your heart talk
when your head should be talking.

828
00:49:04,528 --> 00:49:06,864
- All right, girl.
- Mm-hmm.

829
00:49:06,947 --> 00:49:09,741
- Uh-huh.
- Mm-hmm.

830
00:49:09,825 --> 00:49:12,077
Furthermore, I'm a beautician,
and I'm good at my job.

831
00:49:12,161 --> 00:49:14,079
<i>You all are at
the bottom of the rung.</i>

832
00:49:14,163 --> 00:49:16,415
Givin' head for five dollars.
Ain't that good at it either.

833
00:49:16,498 --> 00:49:20,669
- Hey, I got five dollars.
- Probably could show you a thing or two about it.

834
00:49:20,711 --> 00:49:24,173
<i>Come on. Talk to me, child. I might be able
to contribute to your work ethics...</i>

835
00:49:24,214 --> 00:49:27,551
'cause you can't possibly be good workin'
the streets walkin' in this neighborhood.

836
00:49:27,593 --> 00:49:32,264
If you gonna be a ho, be an ambitious ho.
Work uptown or something.

837
00:49:32,347 --> 00:49:34,266
Oh, please!

838
00:49:34,349 --> 00:49:36,435
You cannot teach me nothin'.

839
00:49:36,518 --> 00:49:40,689
Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Can we stop
this disgusting conversation, please?

840
00:49:40,731 --> 00:49:43,734
It is not disgusting.
It's natural". Naturale."

841
00:49:43,817 --> 00:49:46,612
It's not "naturale"
for a man, woman.

842
00:49:49,698 --> 00:49:52,910
<i>- Here's a banana. Show us.
- He does his homework,
he's still on punishment.</i>

843
00:49:52,951 --> 00:49:56,538
<i>Hey, y'all, I'll be back.
Take care of my client for me, all right?</i>

844
00:49:56,622 --> 00:49:58,582
<i>- Good luck, girl.
- Thanks.</i>

845
00:49:58,624 --> 00:50:00,250
- Later,J.
- Bye, Jenny.

846
00:50:00,334 --> 00:50:03,795
- Come on. Show us.
- I ain't showin' y'all nothin'.

847
00:50:03,879 --> 00:50:06,965
- You're scared.
- Um, excuse me, miss. Uh, actually, he's right.

848
00:50:07,049 --> 00:50:09,426
Uh, maybe, you know, you should
show us a little somethin'.

849
00:50:09,468 --> 00:50:12,554
Uh, can I watch?

850
00:50:12,596 --> 00:50:17,059
- For you, baby, I'll do it.
- My girl. Thank you.

851
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:19,061
<i>That's what I'm talkin'about.</i>

852
00:50:19,102 --> 00:50:21,313
<i>Christmas came early.
Oh, Lord have mercy.</i>

853
00:50:21,396 --> 00:50:23,565
The Superwoman suit on.
Uh-huh.

854
00:50:23,649 --> 00:50:26,735
<i>It's killin'me. Yes, please.</i>

855
00:50:26,819 --> 00:50:30,239
<i>Oh, yes. Hit that.
Hey, don't be so violent.</i>

856
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:35,118
<i>Lady. Mmm.
Oh, please peel that.</i>

857
00:50:39,039 --> 00:50:42,167
<i>- That's what I'm talkin' about.
- I'm gonna see you in
the back. That is for certain.</i>

858
00:50:42,251 --> 00:50:45,337
- How much I got?
- Look at that. Girl, you second rate.

859
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:47,798
<i>- I'm good.
- Give me this.</i>

860
00:50:47,881 --> 00:50:52,302
Say what you want, but I'm a man,
and I know what men like.

861
00:50:55,180 --> 00:50:57,432
A little demonstration for you.

862
00:50:57,474 --> 00:51:00,310
All right. All right.

863
00:51:00,352 --> 00:51:03,272
- Please don't do that.
That's gonna make me throw up.
- Come on. School me.

864
00:51:03,313 --> 00:51:05,941
- Oh, Lord help us.
- Y'all doin' too much.

865
00:51:06,024 --> 00:51:07,818
- It's nothin'.
- Whatever. I'm eatin' this banana.

866
00:51:07,901 --> 00:51:10,988
Excuse me. I have to regurgitate.
Thank you very much.

867
00:51:11,071 --> 00:51:15,117
- I'm good. I know I'm good. Hey.
- Man, get the hell away from me.

868
00:51:15,159 --> 00:51:18,453
- Look at you, lookin' at me all differently now.
- Get the hell out of here, man.

869
00:51:18,495 --> 00:51:20,914
Changed the game on you, huh?
Now, all of a sudden...

870
00:51:20,998 --> 00:51:23,667
you lookin' at the brother all differently,
with lust and admiration.

871
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:28,297
- But stop! Can't have none of this.
You ain't my type.
- Oh, well, I'm all broken up.

872
00:51:28,338 --> 00:51:32,301
I just bet you are, Mr. Man. My gaydar tells me
you got a little sugar in your tank.

873
00:51:32,342 --> 00:51:35,262
- A little Sweet'n Low.
- Unlike Eddie Griffin...

874
00:51:35,345 --> 00:51:37,973
you are the real
undercover brother.

875
00:51:38,015 --> 00:51:40,851
You know what?

876
00:51:40,893 --> 00:51:42,895
<i>Why gay people always
tryin'to say somebody gay?</i>

877
00:51:42,978 --> 00:51:46,190
Always trying to bring somebody over to their
team. Homosexuals are likeJehovah's Witnesses.

878
00:51:46,273 --> 00:51:48,692
You always tryin' to convert somebody.
Get away from me, man.

879
00:51:48,775 --> 00:51:51,653
Wait a minute. Don't even get it twisted.
Ain't nobody tryin' to convert you.

880
00:51:51,695 --> 00:51:54,740
But check it.
Any time a man is actin' all manly...

881
00:51:54,823 --> 00:51:57,201
<i>and talking about sex and all
the trimmings he be gettin'...</i>

882
00:51:57,284 --> 00:52:00,329
and how he can't stay stand
gay people, somethin' wrong.

883
00:52:00,370 --> 00:52:02,873
<i>Somethin'wrong.
It's a sign of somethin'.</i>

884
00:52:02,956 --> 00:52:05,417
- Man, you better back off me.
- Come on. Give me a kiss.

885
00:52:05,501 --> 00:52:07,503
- Get the hell away from me!
- Give me a kiss.

886
00:52:07,586 --> 00:52:10,547
<i>You better get the hell
away from me, man! Get outta here!</i>

887
00:52:10,589 --> 00:52:13,050
Stop, Ricky.

888
00:52:16,053 --> 00:52:18,347
What you hos doin' up in here?

889
00:52:18,388 --> 00:52:21,350
<i>You better get your ass back on that street
and make me some money.</i>

890
00:52:21,391 --> 00:52:23,769
- Okay.
- You understand me? Get your ass out there!

891
00:52:23,852 --> 00:52:27,356
<i>- Sorry.
- Hurry up! Don't let me catch you up in here again.</i>

892
00:52:27,439 --> 00:52:29,942
<i>Okay, baby.</i>

893
00:52:30,025 --> 00:52:33,612
Mm-hmm. Big bad Silk.
Why you so hard on those girls?

894
00:52:33,695 --> 00:52:35,697
Lashaunna, stay out
of my business, all right?

895
00:52:35,739 --> 00:52:38,742
- Ooh, you're so tough.

896
00:52:38,784 --> 00:52:41,370
How your mama doin'?

897
00:52:41,411 --> 00:52:44,581
- Tell her I'll be over for that bid whist game.

898
00:52:44,665 --> 00:52:47,793
- I've known him since he was a
little boy. Oh, now he a pimp.

899
00:52:47,876 --> 00:52:50,379
Got him some hos. Please.

900
00:53:00,764 --> 00:53:03,392
- Hello, Michael.
- Hey.

901
00:53:03,433 --> 00:53:05,853
Thank you.

902
00:53:05,936 --> 00:53:09,064
Jenny, you know,
I must admit I'm really glad...

903
00:53:09,106 --> 00:53:11,108
- you invited me out to lunch.
- Me too.

904
00:53:11,191 --> 00:53:13,944
And I know you must think
I'm completely irresponsible...

905
00:53:13,986 --> 00:53:16,572
for taking you up on your offer,
but, uh, here I am.

906
00:53:18,949 --> 00:53:21,118
Yeah, here you are.

907
00:53:21,201 --> 00:53:24,621
Look, Jenny,
I want to be clear.

908
00:53:24,705 --> 00:53:27,833
<i>When you meet with the committee today,
I have a job to do.</i>

909
00:53:27,916 --> 00:53:31,795
I am opposing counsel, and l...
I have to represent my client.

910
00:53:33,338 --> 00:53:35,340
So I'm sort of
warning you that there's a...

911
00:53:35,424 --> 00:53:38,135
there's a limit to the type
of help that I can provide.

912
00:53:38,218 --> 00:53:41,805
- Things may get a little uncomfortable.
- I understand, Michael.

913
00:53:41,889 --> 00:53:44,850
You have a job to do,
and I respect that, okay?

914
00:53:44,933 --> 00:53:47,436
Okay.

915
00:53:47,519 --> 00:53:51,398
And just so you know...

916
00:53:51,482 --> 00:53:53,817
you've been a big enough
help already, all right?

917
00:53:53,859 --> 00:53:56,778
All right.

918
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:04,161
- So, enough about work.
- Okay.

919
00:54:04,244 --> 00:54:07,456
- I wanna know what's up with you.
- Well, what do you want to know?

920
00:54:07,498 --> 00:54:10,459
- Everything.
- Everything... well, that's a lot.

921
00:54:10,501 --> 00:54:12,961
Hmm. We gotta start
somewhere, right?

922
00:54:13,003 --> 00:54:16,340
- Yes, we do.

923
00:54:26,683 --> 00:54:30,020
Yeah, baby, I had a really
good time, and I love this ring.

924
00:54:30,062 --> 00:54:32,022
Oh, it's so beautiful.

925
00:54:32,064 --> 00:54:36,026
Uh-huh! Caught your cheatin' ass!

926
00:54:36,068 --> 00:54:38,362
- So, you take it easy, all right?
- All right, baby.

927
00:54:38,445 --> 00:54:40,364
- We'll hook up later.
- Okay.

928
00:54:40,447 --> 00:54:43,492
- I'll see you later.
- Ooh!

929
00:54:43,575 --> 00:54:46,745
Oh, my God! I'm gonna... Ooh!

930
00:54:46,829 --> 00:54:49,122
Oh!

931
00:54:49,206 --> 00:54:51,166
Again. Oh!

932
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:53,710
- My man!
- I knew it.

933
00:54:55,379 --> 00:54:59,007
- What you grinnin' about?
- Mmm! Everybody just a-cheesin'!

934
00:54:59,049 --> 00:55:02,427
<i>- Did you wash?
- Girl, you been gone for an hour and a half.</i>

935
00:55:02,511 --> 00:55:05,722
- Girl, ain't you got no shame?
We know what you been doin'.
- Mm-hmm. Right.

936
00:55:05,764 --> 00:55:08,392
- Mind your business.
- I don't know why I ask.

937
00:55:08,475 --> 00:55:11,728
- Everybody up in here already
know what you been doin'.
- What have I been doin', Percy?

938
00:55:11,812 --> 00:55:15,691
- Hiding the salami.

939
00:55:15,732 --> 00:55:18,360
Look, I don't make no bones
about what I do, all right?

940
00:55:18,402 --> 00:55:20,737
I like men that got it goin' on.

941
00:55:20,821 --> 00:55:22,948
I only deal with
ballers and shot callers.

942
00:55:23,031 --> 00:55:25,868
<i>See, I'm bisexual.</i>

943
00:55:25,909 --> 00:55:29,121
You wanna have sex with me,
you got to "buy" me somethin'.

944
00:55:29,204 --> 00:55:32,875
Ooh.

945
00:55:32,916 --> 00:55:37,379
- Okay. That was good.
- Hey, Shaunna, check out
this new friendship ring I got.

946
00:55:37,421 --> 00:55:40,048
- Oh, that is cute.
- Diamond studded, baby.

947
00:55:40,132 --> 00:55:41,925
Thank you, girl.
See you next week.

948
00:55:42,009 --> 00:55:45,554
- Diamonds are a girl's best friend.
- Yeah, cubic zirconia.

949
00:55:45,637 --> 00:55:50,475
What time is it? Aw, man, I gotta go get
Patrick from the gas station.

950
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:52,561
- Patrick.
- Don't let him bully you.

951
00:55:52,603 --> 00:55:56,231
<i>- What are you doin'?
- Goin' to lunch.</i>

952
00:55:56,273 --> 00:55:59,109
- Mmm! Silly girl.
- So, um, Trina...

953
00:55:59,193 --> 00:56:01,487
<i>what'd you have to do
to get that ring?</i>

954
00:56:01,570 --> 00:56:03,739
Nothin' I wouldn't
be doin' anyways.

955
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:07,117
You know, baby, you really shouldn't use
your body as a commodity.

956
00:56:07,201 --> 00:56:09,244
<i>Baby, you ain't
gotta do that.</i>

957
00:56:09,286 --> 00:56:11,288
You're smarter than that.

958
00:56:11,330 --> 00:56:14,249
Look, can I do me, please?

959
00:56:14,291 --> 00:56:18,837
Thanks. I'm sick of y'all lecturin' me
on what I should and shouldn't be doin'.

960
00:56:18,921 --> 00:56:22,132
I'm a grown-ass woman.
Y'all are gettin' on my nerves.

961
00:56:22,174 --> 00:56:26,678
- Mmm.
- All right. Whatever. Go to the clinic on your own.

962
00:56:26,762 --> 00:56:29,515
What's up with her?

963
00:56:29,598 --> 00:56:32,684
<i>Everybodyjust a-cheesin'today?
What's going on?</i>

964
00:56:32,768 --> 00:56:36,188
What, I can't smile? Something got to be
wrong 'cause I'm smiling?

965
00:56:36,271 --> 00:56:38,857
- Uh-huh.
- Uh-huh.

966
00:56:38,941 --> 00:56:42,778
Miss Carter, sorry I'm late.
Had to pick up my son some lunch.

967
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:45,781
<i>I'll be right with you, okay?</i>

968
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:49,409
<i>Trey? Come on
down here, baby.</i>

969
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:53,121
Now, Trey, were you a good boy?

970
00:56:53,163 --> 00:56:55,123
- Yes.
- Yes, ma'am.

971
00:56:55,165 --> 00:56:58,502
<i>- Yes, ma'am.
- Here's some lunch.
Wash your hands before you eat.</i>

972
00:56:58,585 --> 00:57:00,504
- Okay. Thanks, Mom.
- You're welcome, baby.

973
00:57:01,588 --> 00:57:03,632
<i>All right, Jenny.
So how'd it go?</i>

974
00:57:03,715 --> 00:57:07,678
- Good. I'm gonna go down there at
3:00 and handle that business.
- That's what I'm talkin' about.

975
00:57:07,719 --> 00:57:09,680
<i>- Hello!
- Back again?</i>

976
00:57:09,721 --> 00:57:12,683
Back again. Hey, Ricky, I just wanted
to introduce you to my friend.

977
00:57:12,724 --> 00:57:15,185
She's here visiting from Sweden.
And she loved my hair so much...

978
00:57:15,227 --> 00:57:17,521
she wanted to know if you
could do hers as well.

979
00:57:17,563 --> 00:57:19,523
- Do you have some time?
- Sure.

980
00:57:19,565 --> 00:57:21,692
<i>- Ah!
- White girls.</i>

981
00:57:21,775 --> 00:57:24,570
- Sit down.
- He'll take good care of you.

982
00:57:24,653 --> 00:57:28,282
Uh, take note, shop.
This is what happens when you do good work.

983
00:57:28,365 --> 00:57:30,409
You get referrals.
Half my clients are referrals.

984
00:57:30,492 --> 00:57:32,661
And half of your referrals,
you're sleeping with.

985
00:57:36,039 --> 00:57:38,542
<i>- A little pink toe.
- Here you are.</i>

986
00:57:38,584 --> 00:57:41,670
Holler at your boy.
Holler at your boy. Back again.

987
00:57:41,712 --> 00:57:45,174

I got Evelyn "Champagne" King, Kool Moe Dee.

988
00:57:45,257 --> 00:57:47,718
<i>Uh, got theJay-Z. Holler at your boy.
What you need?</i>

989
00:57:47,759 --> 00:57:51,722
- Hey, dawg, just throw that in the box
so I can check it out.
- Okay, I got that.

990
00:57:51,805 --> 00:57:54,892
- Backstreet Boys?
- Can I get a whoop, whoop?
Nah, I ain't got no Backstreet...

991
00:57:54,975 --> 00:57:57,853
The last CD you brought up in here
was you singin' in the shower.

992
00:57:57,895 --> 00:57:59,855
That's all right though.
Sound good, didn't it?

993
00:57:59,897 --> 00:58:01,857
<i>- No. You can't beat Beyonce.</i>

994
00:58:01,899 --> 00:58:04,943
Oh, yeah. You gonna love this.
You gonna love this.

995
00:58:07,029 --> 00:58:09,698
Ah, you know what I mean?
I been waitin' on that one.

996
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:12,868
<i>This is it. You know?
You be up in the club. I'll show you this.</i>

997
00:58:12,951 --> 00:58:15,787
- Whoo, whoo!

998
00:58:15,871 --> 00:58:18,749
<i>- Oh, snizap!

999
00:58:18,790 --> 00:58:20,876
- Oh, I'm feelin' that.
- You know what I'm talking about.

1000
00:58:20,918 --> 00:58:23,045
Let me tell ya.
That's my shit.

1001
00:58:23,086 --> 00:58:25,380
<i>- Ooh, I like that.
- Ahhh!</i>

1002
00:58:25,422 --> 00:58:27,591
<i>That's my cut right there, boy!</i>

1003
00:58:27,674 --> 00:58:29,593
Ooh, yeah!

1004
00:58:29,676 --> 00:58:31,637
What? What?

00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:35,390
What? What?
Mmm! Hey!

00:58:35,474 --> 00:58:38,977
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

1007
00:58:59,915 --> 00:59:04,336
- What took you so long?
- I'm sorry I'm late, Patrick,
but there was heavy traffic.

1008
00:59:04,419 --> 00:59:06,505
I've been standin' out here,
like, 15 minutes, man.

1009
00:59:06,588 --> 00:59:09,800
- I'm sorry.
- You know, that's the problem. You always sorry.

1010
00:59:09,883 --> 00:59:12,219
<i>You know what?
I don't even want to go to lunch.</i>

1011
00:59:12,302 --> 00:59:15,138
<i>- Why?
- You go back to the beauty shop.
Do whatever you gotta do.</i>

1012
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:17,015
- Why?
- 'Cause you done disrupted my mood.

1013
00:59:17,099 --> 00:59:21,186
- You know what? Get out the car. Gimme the keys.
- Patrick...

1014
00:59:21,270 --> 00:59:23,772
Get out the car, man.
Move, man.

1015
00:59:25,566 --> 00:59:29,361
<i>You can walk. You can catch a cab,
catch a bus and do whatever you gotta do, man.</i>

1016
00:59:29,444 --> 00:59:32,447
- Don't have me standin' outside.
- Patrick, don't. I need my bag.

1017
00:59:32,489 --> 00:59:35,534
- Yeah. You can get it later.
- Wait. Don't drive off, Patrick. I need my bag!

1018
00:59:35,617 --> 00:59:38,287
Throw the bag out the window or somethin'.
Patrick, I need my bag!

1019
00:59:38,370 --> 00:59:40,372
You know what?

1020
00:59:41,415 --> 00:59:43,333
<i>Take the bag.</i>

1021
01:00:06,482 --> 01:00:09,026
Go, white girls! Go, white girls!

1022
01:00:09,109 --> 01:00:12,237
<i>Go, white girls! Go, white girls!</i>

1023
01:00:35,511 --> 01:00:40,015
<i>Go, Trey! Go, Trey! Go, Trey!</i>

1024
01:00:40,098 --> 01:00:42,893
<i>- Go, Trey!

01:00:42,976 --> 01:00:44,937

Go, Shaunna!

1029
01:01:07,417 --> 01:01:09,878
Oh!

1030
01:01:19,137 --> 01:01:21,139
- Crazy.
- Oh, my God.

1031
01:01:22,558 --> 01:01:25,394
Oh, my God.

1032
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:31,650
Wow. I really love this place.

1033
01:01:34,153 --> 01:01:37,156
- It's crazy, but I love it.

1034
01:01:38,907 --> 01:01:40,826
Gone all the time.

1035
01:01:40,909 --> 01:01:43,954
- What's the matter, Anna-Mae?
Why are you upset?
- Don't ask me nothin'.

1036
01:01:44,037 --> 01:01:47,749
Oh, come on. The sun is shining.
It's a beautiful day. What's the matter?

1037
01:01:47,791 --> 01:01:50,335
- Where's Percy?
- That's a real good question.

1038
01:01:50,419 --> 01:01:53,589
<i>I'd like to know where he at
my damn self.</i>

1039
01:01:53,672 --> 01:01:59,303
<i>Over there hangin'out at that... beauty shop__
that cesspool of sin.</i>

1040
01:01:59,386 --> 01:02:04,016
- Anna-Mae...
- But, Lord, do somethin' to him.

1041
01:02:04,099 --> 01:02:08,812
Strike his old ass,
please, Jesus, please.

1042
01:02:08,854 --> 01:02:14,443
If you can't strike him, strike that beauty shop
so I can get my husband back.

1043
01:02:14,526 --> 01:02:18,822
Amen, ha-ha! Amen.

1044
01:02:20,365 --> 01:02:22,826
- What are you doin' now, Anna-Mae?
- I'm goin' down there...

1045
01:02:22,910 --> 01:02:24,828
and give him
a "piece" of my mind.

1046
01:02:24,912 --> 01:02:27,247
Oh, all right then.

1047
01:02:30,125 --> 01:02:32,628
Yo.

1048
01:02:32,711 --> 01:02:35,672
Fine, then.
I ain't... standin' up for that...

1049
01:02:35,714 --> 01:02:39,218
<i>- Girl, I hear you.
- Gonna sit down.</i>

1050
01:02:40,302 --> 01:02:42,221
It's hotter than...

1051
01:02:43,472 --> 01:02:45,516
<i>Mmm. I love them shoes.</i>

1052
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:48,352
- Girl, you can have 'em.
- I don't know how you walk on 'em.

1053
01:02:48,393 --> 01:02:50,813
These aren't even my highest heels,
and my feet are killin' me.

1054
01:02:50,854 --> 01:02:52,815
<i>Girl...</i>

1055
01:02:52,856 --> 01:02:56,902
Hey, don't you sit down, girl!
Don't you sit down.

1056
01:02:56,985 --> 01:03:00,906
Don't you ever let me catch you sittin' down
on the job again, you understand me?

1057
01:03:00,989 --> 01:03:03,992
- We just sat down.
- Time is money. And every second
you not on your feet...

1058
01:03:04,034 --> 01:03:06,370
and not on your back,
you costin' me money.

1059
01:03:06,411 --> 01:03:10,207
Don't mess with my money, ho.
Don't you ever mess with a pimp's money.

1060
01:03:10,290 --> 01:03:12,376
Now get back to work.
Get back.

1061
01:03:12,459 --> 01:03:15,379
<i>- Mmm-mmm.
- That's ridiculous.</i>

1062
01:03:15,462 --> 01:03:19,925
- It's a damn shame is what it is.
- Watchin' stuff like that just pisses me off.

1063
01:03:20,008 --> 01:03:22,261
<i>I can't even stand to look at it.</i>

1064
01:03:22,344 --> 01:03:24,847
<i>This neighborhood is
in a vicious cycle, girl.</i>

1065
01:03:24,888 --> 01:03:26,932
- Somethin' needs to change.
- Got that right.

1066
01:03:27,015 --> 01:03:30,561
<i>Yeah! And don't you ever mess
with a pimp's money!</i>

1067
01:03:30,644 --> 01:03:33,564
Yeah.

1068
01:03:33,647 --> 01:03:36,984
Well, look, girl, it's 2:30.
I'm gonna head on downtown. Wish me luck.

1069
01:03:37,067 --> 01:03:38,986
Good luck.

1070
01:03:40,654 --> 01:03:44,575
You know, every time I see the Oscars,
I gotta aks myself the same question:

1071
01:03:44,658 --> 01:03:46,827
Why did Halle Berry
win that award?

1072
01:03:46,910 --> 01:03:50,539
- What did she do to deserve an Oscar?
- Screw Billy Bob Thornton.

1073
01:03:50,622 --> 01:03:53,584
- Oh!
- Oh, my God. Did y'all see "Monster's Ball?"

1074
01:03:53,625 --> 01:03:56,837
<i>Billy Bob had her
butt naked on the floor...</i>

1075
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:59,882
screwed her like a ho,
and they gave her an award for that.

1076
01:03:59,923 --> 01:04:05,888
- Right. That's how they do it.
- She's arguably the prettiest
black woman in the country...

1077
01:04:05,929 --> 01:04:08,474
and they give her an award
for screwin' Billy Bob?

1078
01:04:08,557 --> 01:04:11,560
- That's Hollywood.
- That's not the only reason she got the award.

1079
01:04:11,602 --> 01:04:14,563
What happened to Angela Bassett
in "What's Love Got to Do with It?"

1080
01:04:14,605 --> 01:04:17,816
- Exactly.
- Or Cicely Tyson.
- She put it down.

1081
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:21,069
- Or even Oprah Winfrey in "Beloved?"
- They were all great. Yeah.

1082
01:04:21,153 --> 01:04:25,324
You mean to tell me that that was the best
performance that we've seen from a black woman...

1083
01:04:25,407 --> 01:04:27,326
in 74 years?

1084
01:04:27,409 --> 01:04:29,328
No, you right.
You right about that.

1085
01:04:29,411 --> 01:04:32,706
And the first black woman
in a leading role to receive an Oscar...

1086
01:04:32,789 --> 01:04:36,418
and she gets it for gettin' butt naked
and screwin' Billy Bob Thornton.

1087
01:04:36,502 --> 01:04:40,506
- That's Hollywood.
- I was so upset about that.

1088
01:04:40,589 --> 01:04:43,884
Me too. A lot of black people was upset.
Just goes to show you...

1089
01:04:43,967 --> 01:04:47,763
get butt naked for the white man,
and you win an award.

1090
01:04:47,804 --> 01:04:49,598
- Okay, right.
- Okay.

1091
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:51,934
You know what?
In defense of Halle, though, she was good.

1092
01:04:51,975 --> 01:04:55,270
Look, I ain't mad at Halle.
This has nothin' to do with Halle.

1093
01:04:55,312 --> 01:04:58,774
This has everything to do with the mentality
of the nominating committee.

1094
01:04:58,816 --> 01:05:00,776
It just goes to show a lot.

1095
01:05:00,818 --> 01:05:04,696
Plus, ain't nobody
was lookin' at her actin'.

1096
01:05:04,780 --> 01:05:08,700
She was butt naked.
That's what I was lookin' at.

1097
01:05:08,784 --> 01:05:13,038
I couldn't see past the actin'.
All I saw was naked.

1098
01:05:13,121 --> 01:05:16,291
Naked. Naked. Right.

1099
01:05:16,333 --> 01:05:18,293
- Percy, you crazy.
- Naked.

1100
01:05:21,713 --> 01:05:25,843
'Cause I'm sick and tired.
Yes. Huh.

1101
01:05:27,010 --> 01:05:29,513
<i>You look gorgeous.
Take a look.</i>

1102
01:05:29,596 --> 01:05:33,559
- Oh, Tami, I love it!
- Isn't it wonderful?

1103
01:05:33,642 --> 01:05:37,062
Oh, Ricky,
you do good head.

1104
01:05:37,146 --> 01:05:40,190
<i>- - Can you explain it to her later?</i>

1105
01:05:40,274 --> 01:05:42,985
- Thank you so much. It's beautiful.
- Oh, snap.

1106
01:05:43,026 --> 01:05:45,487
<i>- Oh, snap!
- Oh, snap.</i>

1107
01:05:45,529 --> 01:05:49,324
Okay. Nice.
Two of'em. All right. Thank you.

1108
01:05:49,366 --> 01:05:51,410
- Bye.
- See you later, baby. Take care of that girl.

1109
01:05:51,493 --> 01:05:53,412
- All right.
- All right.

1110
01:05:53,495 --> 01:05:56,248
White chicks.
Whoa. Phew.

1111
01:06:04,882 --> 01:06:07,092
Okay. Who used
the bathroom last, huh?

1112
01:06:07,176 --> 01:06:10,721
- Who used the bathroom last?
- What you lookin' at me for?

1113
01:06:10,804 --> 01:06:13,807
<i>How many times I got to tell y'all?
If you gonna use the bathroom...</i>

1114
01:06:13,891 --> 01:06:16,018
to stop the toilet from runnin',
what you gotta do?

1115
01:06:16,059 --> 01:06:18,562
- Jiggle the handle.
- That's right. Jiggle the handle.

1116
01:06:18,645 --> 01:06:21,857
Open up the top and play with the little
ball-thing. What's the matter with y'all?

1117
01:06:21,899 --> 01:06:26,278
And who took the screwdriver? We need the
screwdriver to open and close the bathroom door.

1118
01:06:26,361 --> 01:06:29,364
<i>My goodness. Those thievin'-ass people...
stealin'stuff for nothin'.</i>

1119
01:06:29,448 --> 01:06:33,744
What you gonna do with a screwdriver? How
many times we gonna replace the screwdriver?

1120
01:06:33,827 --> 01:06:36,955
- Why not just put a doorknob on it?
- Are you gonna put it on there?

1121
01:06:38,248 --> 01:06:41,585
All right then. Shut up.

1122
01:06:41,627 --> 01:06:44,254
You know what?
I'm goin' to lunch.

1123
01:06:44,338 --> 01:06:47,716
- God.
- What you laughin' at?

1124
01:06:47,758 --> 01:06:50,761
<i>Y'all funny. Y'all are funny.</i>

1125
01:06:55,307 --> 01:06:58,352
- Percy was the one that used the bathroom last.
- What you talkin' about?

1126
01:06:58,435 --> 01:07:01,772
- I ain't used it. Did you see me use it?
- Yes, I saw you.

1127
01:07:01,855 --> 01:07:03,565
- You didn't see me do nothin'.
- I did.

1128
01:07:03,607 --> 01:07:06,109
- No, you didn't. No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did. Yes, I did.

1129
01:07:06,193 --> 01:07:08,403
Whatever. I'm goin' to get some K.F.C.
Anybody want some?

1130
01:07:08,445 --> 01:07:10,447
- Man, get on, man.
- Didn't!

1131
01:07:12,282 --> 01:07:14,201
Guess not.

1132
01:07:14,284 --> 01:07:17,120
- Where's your car?
- Patrick's borrowing it.

1133
01:07:17,162 --> 01:07:20,666
- Where he at? I ain't see him drop you off.
- Uh, I took a cab.

1134
01:07:20,749 --> 01:07:24,253
<i>You took a cab?
That's your car, and you took a cab?</i>

1135
01:07:24,336 --> 01:07:26,630
<i>You know what?
That's on you.</i>

1136
01:07:26,713 --> 01:07:29,132
You wanna deal with him
the rest of your life, that's your business.

1137
01:07:29,174 --> 01:07:32,261
<i>I'm gonna start mindin'my own business,
'cause people in this beauty shop...</i>

1138
01:07:32,344 --> 01:07:35,055
<i>just gettin'weirder every day.</i>

1139
01:07:41,854 --> 01:07:44,439
- What?
- Nothin'.

1140
01:07:44,481 --> 01:07:48,026
You walkin'? Takin' cabs?
This chick is crazy.

1141
01:07:48,110 --> 01:07:52,739
<i>Bunker buster. Yeah, it's that bunker buster,
all right.</i>

1142
01:07:52,823 --> 01:07:56,451
I'm tired.
How much must a sister put up with?

1143
01:07:56,493 --> 01:08:02,207
Tired's good. Change only comes when
a woman gets fed up. That's right. Get tired.

1144
01:08:02,291 --> 01:08:06,295
<i>Uh-oh!
'Cause when a woman's fed up</i>

1145
01:08:07,629 --> 01:08:10,299
<i>It ain't nothin'
you can do about it</i>

1146
01:08:10,340 --> 01:08:14,178
R. Kelly broke it down, right?
It's like runnin' out of love

1147
01:08:14,261 --> 01:08:18,182
Ah!
And it's too late to talk about it

1148
01:08:18,223 --> 01:08:21,685
- Say what, Brenda?
- Ricky. Ricky, shut up, okay?

1149
01:08:21,768 --> 01:08:24,480
- I was breakin' it down for her, tryin' to...
- Why you ridin' me?

1150
01:08:24,521 --> 01:08:28,233
I don't be talkin' about you and your little
white girls you be humpin' on the low.

1151
01:08:28,317 --> 01:08:31,987
- Ricky, will you please shut up?

1152
01:09:00,474 --> 01:09:03,685
Here goes.

1153
01:09:18,826 --> 01:09:22,538
<i>- Mike, what is she doin'here?
- Ah, beats me.</i>

1154
01:09:22,621 --> 01:09:25,415
<i>I know you had
something to do with this, and it's not good.</i>

1155
01:09:25,499 --> 01:09:28,418
Look. You said it earlier. I'm a lawyer.
I'm here to represent my client.

1156
01:09:28,502 --> 01:09:31,505
<i>Now, I may be treading
close to the line, but I won't cross over it.</i>

1157
01:09:31,588 --> 01:09:34,758
<i>- I sure hope you know what you're doin', buddy.
- I don't. Let me handle this.</i>

1158
01:09:34,842 --> 01:09:37,302
It's your case, your bar license.
You'd better know what you're doin'.

1159
01:09:37,386 --> 01:09:39,888
Thank you. Miss Smithe,
imagine seein' you here.

1160
01:09:39,972 --> 01:09:42,683
- Yeah, imagine. How y'all doin'?
- Good.

1161
01:09:42,766 --> 01:09:45,727
- Good. Yeah. So, you're goin' into the...
- The review board.

1162
01:09:45,811 --> 01:09:47,896
- Uh-huh.
- I'll see you inside.
- All right.

1163
01:09:49,898 --> 01:09:51,817
Y...

1164
01:09:51,900 --> 01:09:54,111
Hey, look at this
faggot-ass nigga, yo.

1165
01:09:54,194 --> 01:09:56,155
Stop it.

1166
01:09:56,238 --> 01:09:59,449
What you got, some faggot treats?

1167
01:09:59,533 --> 01:10:02,327
Leave me alone.

1168
01:10:02,411 --> 01:10:05,289
Not a good day for this.
Y'all better stop it and leave me alone.

1169
01:10:10,878 --> 01:10:12,588
- Hey, faggot. I'm talkin' to you.
- Yeah, you.

1170
01:10:12,671 --> 01:10:15,174
If I'm a faggot, then what does that
make your daddy?

1171
01:10:15,257 --> 01:10:18,510
- Aw-w-w!
- What?

1172
01:10:20,512 --> 01:10:22,514
- Hey, man, what you say?
- You heard me.

1173
01:10:22,598 --> 01:10:26,852
What you say, man?

1174
01:10:26,935 --> 01:10:29,938
<i>- Let's get this faggot-ass nigga, yo.
- Open this shit, yo.</i>

1175
01:10:29,980 --> 01:10:32,983
- You little faggot! What's up, nigga?

1176
01:10:33,066 --> 01:10:35,611
- What's up "now," nigga? What? Now, what?

1177
01:10:35,694 --> 01:10:38,989
Faggot-ass. Faggot-ass.
What's up, faggot-ass nigga?

1178
01:10:44,536 --> 01:10:46,497
Get in! Get in!

1179
01:10:50,751 --> 01:10:55,464
"Jiggle, jiggle, jiggle.
Celebrating the power of pink."

1180
01:10:57,508 --> 01:11:01,470
<i>- I'm gonna kill 'em.
- What the hell's goin'on?</i>

1181
01:11:01,512 --> 01:11:04,139
Oh, my gosh. Somebody egged him.

1182
01:11:04,223 --> 01:11:07,810
- Oh, no! Hey, now wait a minute.
- D.D! D.D! Get...

1183
01:11:07,893 --> 01:11:10,312
- Get off of me!
- Where do you think you're goin' with that?

1184
01:11:10,354 --> 01:11:12,731
- Get... D.D!
- Hey, D.D., man?

1185
01:11:12,815 --> 01:11:15,484
You cannot go out there messin'
with those boys, man. They got guns.

1186
01:11:15,526 --> 01:11:20,489
- They might just look like they 16,
but they got guns.
- I don't care. Get off of me.

1187
01:11:20,572 --> 01:11:22,825
Hey, you ain't goin'
back out there.

1188
01:11:22,866 --> 01:11:25,577
- Come on, baby. Come on.
- Get off of me.

1189
01:11:25,661 --> 01:11:28,705
- Get the scissors. Lashaunna, get the scissors.
- I got 'em. I got 'em.

1190
01:11:34,002 --> 01:11:36,213
Hey, yo, man, what the hell's
the matter with y'all?

1191
01:11:36,296 --> 01:11:39,716
Who's this nigga talkin' to?
Who are you, man?

1192
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:42,344
Hey, man, go back inside the shop, man.
Who is you, dawg?

1193
01:11:42,427 --> 01:11:45,430
- You know, you need to back up
off us, or somethin' happen.
- Or what?

1194
01:11:45,514 --> 01:11:49,017
What you mean, what? This ain't even your
concern. We beefin' with him, so fall back.

1195
01:11:49,101 --> 01:11:52,187
If you beefin' with him or anybody else
in that shop, you beefin' with me.

1196
01:11:52,229 --> 01:11:54,857
- Man, what you protectin' the faggot for?
- What's your problem?

1197
01:11:54,940 --> 01:11:57,568
Call him a faggot again.
See what happens. Call him a faggot again!

1198
01:11:57,651 --> 01:12:00,195
It's cool, son. It ain't even that serious.
We were just playin'.

1199
01:12:00,237 --> 01:12:03,615
- Well, then play your ass somewhere else.
- Punk ass.

1200
01:12:03,699 --> 01:12:06,618
<i>Don't think we won't be back.</i>

1201
01:12:07,828 --> 01:12:09,830
Nice meetin' you, dawg.

1202
01:12:17,671 --> 01:12:22,342
<i>Ricky, are you crazy,
takin'on them boys like that?</i>

1203
01:12:22,426 --> 01:12:25,762
- What's wrong with you?
- I must be.

1204
01:12:25,846 --> 01:12:27,764
Just chased 'em off with a banana.

1205
01:12:27,848 --> 01:12:30,601
- Oh, my God! That is too stupid.

1206
01:12:30,684 --> 01:12:33,395
Go on, boy!

1207
01:12:33,479 --> 01:12:35,856
Ricky just chased 'em off with a banana.

1208
01:12:46,366 --> 01:12:48,368
You all right?

1209
01:12:51,205 --> 01:12:54,917
Yeah, I'm just...

1210
01:12:57,836 --> 01:13:03,175
I'm... I'm sick...
I'm tired of this.

1211
01:13:03,258 --> 01:13:06,553
I mean, it's like, if you gay and you live
in this country...

1212
01:13:06,637 --> 01:13:08,764
it's like the civil rights movement
all over again.

1213
01:13:08,806 --> 01:13:12,810
I mean, I can't even walk down the street
and mind my own business and be safe.

1214
01:13:12,893 --> 01:13:15,229
It's not right, Ricky.

1215
01:13:15,312 --> 01:13:17,689
<i>And America is so hypocritical
about this issue.</i>

1216
01:13:17,773 --> 01:13:21,652
I mean, what is this whole military
"don't ask, don't tell" policy, huh?

1217
01:13:21,693 --> 01:13:26,657
It's bullshit. It's just another example
of America tryin' to avoid the issues...

1218
01:13:26,698 --> 01:13:29,076
that gays are here,
and we're here to stay.

1219
01:13:29,159 --> 01:13:34,331
We're people, Ricky.
We're family and friends, with feelings.

1220
01:13:34,414 --> 01:13:38,043
<i>And many of the same politicians
that oppose our rights...</i>

1221
01:13:38,126 --> 01:13:43,465
and reinforce this gay-bashin' mentality
are in fact closet gays themselves...

1222
01:13:43,507 --> 01:13:46,552
afraid to appear gay 'cause they
don't wanna be the subject of ridicule.

1223
01:13:46,635 --> 01:13:51,849
<i>I chose a different approach.
I consider myself an activist.</i>

1224
01:13:51,932 --> 01:13:55,477
The flamboyance that you and everybody
else see is a political statement.

1225
01:13:55,561 --> 01:13:58,772
It says that I'm gay.
And I'm proud to be gay...

1226
01:13:58,856 --> 01:14:01,066
even if that means
gettin' egged or worse.

1227
01:14:01,150 --> 01:14:03,068
But I'm gonna
let everyone know it.

1228
01:14:13,412 --> 01:14:15,372
Thanks for stickin' up
for me out there though.

1229
01:14:16,707 --> 01:14:18,667
You're welcome, man.

1230
01:14:20,210 --> 01:14:24,173
For what you did, I would give you a hug,
but... I know how you are.

1231
01:14:24,214 --> 01:14:26,175
So just give me pound.

1232
01:14:26,216 --> 01:14:28,385
- Word.
- You too, fighter.

1233
01:14:34,766 --> 01:14:36,768
- You should just go over...
- So I'm gonna go over...

1234
01:14:36,852 --> 01:14:39,563
Yeah, over there.
I'm just gonna chill... hang out for a while.

1235
01:14:41,857 --> 01:14:44,860
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
Mr. Chairman...

1236
01:14:44,943 --> 01:14:49,406
I'd like to thank you for allowing me
to speak on behalf of my beauty shop.

1237
01:14:49,490 --> 01:14:53,410
I'd just like to say that this shop
has been in my family for years...

1238
01:14:53,494 --> 01:14:56,872
and it's somewhat of a pillar
in the community.

1239
01:14:56,914 --> 01:15:00,375
It provides service and jobs in almost
every aspect of the community.

1240
01:15:00,459 --> 01:15:04,463
<i>- At what point were you planning
on objecting, Michael? Hmm?
...a tragedy to tear it down...</i>

1241
01:15:04,546 --> 01:15:07,007
to put up a parking lot
for the D.W.P.

1242
01:15:07,090 --> 01:15:10,469
Now according to a property survey
that I have here...

1243
01:15:10,552 --> 01:15:15,849
<i>the D. W.P. owns half an acre behind
the building that they are using for storage...</i>

1244
01:15:15,933 --> 01:15:19,645
and another adjacent lot that
they use as a basketball court.

1245
01:15:19,728 --> 01:15:21,897
Michael, objection.
Objection, Michael.

1246
01:15:21,980 --> 01:15:25,984
<i>- Bob, let me handle this, okay?
- It seems to me that the D. W.P.
could make greater use of...</i>

1247
01:15:26,068 --> 01:15:28,320
the land that they have
and are doing nothing with...

1248
01:15:28,403 --> 01:15:32,157
<i>- Let's go. Let's go, Michael.
- rather than petitioning the city to take mine.</i>

1249
01:15:32,241 --> 01:15:34,451
- So I'd like...
- Mr. Chairman, if you'd permit me to interject.

1250
01:15:34,535 --> 01:15:39,122
- Go ahead, Mr. Edward.
- This really isn't the forum
for this sort of discussion.

1251
01:15:39,206 --> 01:15:42,251
<i>Preliminary reports have substantiated
a need for the expansion...</i>

1252
01:15:42,334 --> 01:15:47,089
<i>reports, mind you,
from certified independent agencies...</i>

1253
01:15:47,130 --> 01:15:51,760
not the ramblings and whimsical plea
of an East Side beautician.

1254
01:15:51,844 --> 01:15:54,930
<i>If Miss Smithe was privy
to the information in those reports...</i>

1255
01:15:54,972 --> 01:15:58,433
she'd know that those lots
do not have the same direct street access...

1256
01:15:58,475 --> 01:16:02,980
<i>that her existing lot would provide,
which is why the D. W.P. deems it useful.</i>

1257
01:16:03,063 --> 01:16:08,110
<i>Now, I think the committee has
demonstrated its good nature and its liberality...</i>

1258
01:16:08,152 --> 01:16:10,654
by even allowing Miss Smithe
to speak here today...

1259
01:16:10,737 --> 01:16:13,907
<i>but, Chairman, l...
I see no reason to further subject my client...</i>

1260
01:16:13,991 --> 01:16:17,035
<i>to this unnecessary
and quite futile debate.</i>

1261
01:16:17,119 --> 01:16:21,665
<i>I tend to agree with Mr. Edward.
Miss Smithe, this is not the proper forum...</i>

1262
01:16:21,748 --> 01:16:24,710
<i>and furthermore,
we've already ruled on this issue.</i>

1263
01:16:24,793 --> 01:16:27,296
If you had presented something
a little more substantial...

1264
01:16:27,379 --> 01:16:29,798
<i>perhaps I would continue
to hear it.</i>

1265
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:35,137
<i>But from where I stand, I see nothing
to prevent this action from going through.</i>

1266
01:16:43,103 --> 01:16:45,522
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

1267
01:16:49,610 --> 01:16:51,695
If the committee
would please excuse me for a moment.

1268
01:16:53,489 --> 01:16:56,867
Um, uh, Michael? Mi...

1269
01:16:58,494 --> 01:17:00,662
- Jenny, hold on a sec.
- Just get away from me, Michael.

1270
01:17:00,746 --> 01:17:02,831
Get away.

1271
01:17:06,043 --> 01:17:09,379
Jenny!

1272
01:17:13,383 --> 01:17:15,511
Here we go.

1273
01:17:15,594 --> 01:17:18,096
- It's him. He's so sexy.
- Oh, my God. Wait, wait.

1274
01:17:21,433 --> 01:17:23,519
Go and get him.
Go. Go over there.

1275
01:17:23,602 --> 01:17:26,271
Groupies.

1276
01:17:26,355 --> 01:17:28,941
- So who would I be signin' this to?
- Porsche.

1277
01:17:31,068 --> 01:17:33,570
Thank you.

1278
01:17:33,654 --> 01:17:37,699
- And what's your name, baby?
- Mercedes... you know, like the fancy car?

1279
01:17:37,741 --> 01:17:41,620
Yo, why are black people always namin'
their kids after cars they can't afford?

1280
01:17:41,703 --> 01:17:44,081
You, no move hand!

1281
01:17:44,164 --> 01:17:47,584
<i>- A damn shame.
- So what's your name? Jaguar?</i>

1282
01:17:47,668 --> 01:17:52,047
- No. Tameka Laquana Shameka Johnson!
- So ghetto.

1283
01:17:52,089 --> 01:17:55,092
Is that American?

1284
01:17:55,133 --> 01:17:57,719
- That's cool.
- I love you so much.

1285
01:17:57,803 --> 01:18:01,682
Bye. He signed mine first.

1286
01:18:01,765 --> 01:18:04,893
- He touched my paper. He touched my paper!
- He signed mine first.

1287
01:18:04,935 --> 01:18:07,104
- I love you!
- I love you!

1288
01:18:09,189 --> 01:18:13,402
Well, you must be special. May-Kym came in
on her day off to do your nails. Mmm.

1289
01:18:13,443 --> 01:18:17,406
<i>Huh. May-Kym, you're
the only Asian woman I know take a day off.</i>

1290
01:18:17,447 --> 01:18:21,743
Every other Asian woman work 24-7,
eight days a week. What's goin' on, huh?

1291
01:18:21,785 --> 01:18:27,416
May-Kym American now.
I come to work "rate" and have bad attitude.

1292
01:18:27,457 --> 01:18:31,253
- Mmm. Sucky-sucky.
- You, go get girlfriend!

1293
01:18:31,295 --> 01:18:33,964
- I'm gay.
- I know you're the gay.

1294
01:18:34,047 --> 01:18:37,259
All right, why don't you go
and sit in a little corner and eat some rice.

1295
01:18:37,301 --> 01:18:39,803
- Cross your legs.
- Why don't you go eat some fried chicken!

1296
01:18:39,887 --> 01:18:42,764
Uh-uh. Girlfriend did not go there.

1297
01:18:46,768 --> 01:18:50,272
<i>May-Kym true American now.
I go and vote on "erection"day.</i>

1298
01:18:50,314 --> 01:18:54,526
<i>- Um, I'm sorry. On what day?
- I vote on "erection"day.</i>

1299
01:18:54,610 --> 01:18:58,739
<i>- On "erection"...You... No, no.
- Yeah. I vote democrat.</i>

1300
01:18:58,822 --> 01:19:02,951
<i>- Um, look. "Election"day.
- Can I get the next seat?</i>

1301
01:19:03,035 --> 01:19:05,454
- Yeah.
- Yeah. I'm open. Come on.

1302
01:19:09,541 --> 01:19:11,293
Okay.

1303
01:19:11,335 --> 01:19:13,504
- Right.
- Here you go.

1304
01:19:30,771 --> 01:19:33,565
Oh, girl, those are
some nice rings you got on.

1305
01:19:33,649 --> 01:19:36,026
Thank you. And that's a nice ring
you have on too.

1306
01:19:36,109 --> 01:19:38,529
Oh, you like it?
My new man bought it for me.

1307
01:19:38,612 --> 01:19:41,031
Oh, come on.
Not the ring again!

1308
01:19:41,114 --> 01:19:45,869
He's a doctor. He really isn't all that fine,
but he "is" loaded.

1309
01:19:45,953 --> 01:19:49,331
- Hmm. For real?
- Yeah, child. And that's just the beginnin'.

1310
01:19:49,373 --> 01:19:55,045
- The brother got paper, okay?
A big house and a Benz.
- Hey.

1311
01:19:55,128 --> 01:19:58,841
I'm talkin' some serious loot.
This is just a friendship ring, okay?

1312
01:19:58,924 --> 01:20:01,885
But wait till I get my hooks
in him real good.

1313
01:20:01,927 --> 01:20:05,055
I'm gonna bring a whole new meanin'
to the term "gold digger."

1314
01:20:06,932 --> 01:20:10,018
- I learned my skills from Robin Givens.
- What?

1315
01:20:10,060 --> 01:20:13,856
But ain't nobody bigger than
the queen of the gold diggers.

1316
01:20:13,897 --> 01:20:16,859
- Anna Nicole Smith.
- She hoochie mama.

1317
01:20:18,652 --> 01:20:21,864
- Anna Nicole Smith... that's my girl.
- That girl is crazy.

1318
01:20:21,905 --> 01:20:25,742
- Mmm. I aspire to be just like her.
- So, uh, did you sleep with him?

1319
01:20:25,826 --> 01:20:30,038
Oh, you know I whipped it on him
two or three times, okay?

1320
01:20:30,122 --> 01:20:32,916
I mean, he really isn't
that bad-lookin'.

1321
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,627
Got a cute tattoo
on his shoulder too.

1322
01:20:35,711 --> 01:20:39,131
Does that tattoo have a little heart
with a cute little arrow goin' through it?

1323
01:20:39,214 --> 01:20:41,592
- Yeah. How'd you know?
- 'Cause he's my husband...

1324
01:20:41,675 --> 01:20:44,219
and you the ho
that's been sleepin' with him!

1325
01:20:44,303 --> 01:20:47,806
Oh, da-a-amn!

1326
01:20:47,890 --> 01:20:51,268
- Break it up! Break it up!
- Stop it!

1327
01:20:51,351 --> 01:20:54,313
<i>- Break it up, you guys.
- God!</i>

1328
01:20:54,396 --> 01:20:56,899
- Won't someone help him?
- No, no, no. Let 'em fight, man.

1329
01:20:56,940 --> 01:20:59,651
- It's like gettin' free pay-per-view. You crazy?
- Stop it! Stop it!

1330
01:20:59,735 --> 01:21:01,612
- Stop!
- Break it up!

1331
01:21:01,653 --> 01:21:04,615
<i>Stop it! Stop it!</i>

1332
01:21:10,204 --> 01:21:13,457
- My wig!
- Oh, the bitch is bald!

1333
01:21:13,540 --> 01:21:16,627
Oh, Jesus! Everybody, just calm down. Calm down!

1334
01:21:16,710 --> 01:21:19,922
<i>I'm gonna mess both of y'all up!</i>

1335
01:21:23,467 --> 01:21:25,511
What the hell is goin' on here?

1336
01:21:25,594 --> 01:21:28,597
What the hell is goin' on here?

1337
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:30,682
- That's a good question.
- Oh, Lord.

1338
01:21:30,766 --> 01:21:35,354
This is where I find you...
here in the center of all this havoc...

1339
01:21:35,437 --> 01:21:38,106
<i>runnin'your mouth all day.</i>

1340
01:21:38,190 --> 01:21:40,192
Lord, do somethin'!

1341
01:21:40,275 --> 01:21:43,278
<i>Do somethin'to make
this old man settle.</i>

1342
01:21:43,362 --> 01:21:45,322
<i>
Trey, come on down, baby.</i>

1343
01:21:45,364 --> 01:21:49,034
<i>You better get your old ass back to the
nursin'home and get there pretty damn quick!</i>

1344
01:21:49,117 --> 01:21:53,163
<i>- Woman, don't bother me right now.
- Somebody hold me back...</i>

1345
01:21:53,247 --> 01:21:56,500
'cause I'm gonna kick your ass,
PercevalJohnson!

1346
01:21:56,583 --> 01:21:59,336
- "Perceval"?
- Look, I gotta go, y'all.

1347
01:21:59,419 --> 01:22:02,214
Yeah, that's right.
Let's go. Come on!

1348
01:22:02,297 --> 01:22:07,010
Excuse me, ladies.
I gotta handle some business.

1349
01:22:07,094 --> 01:22:09,304
Handle it.
Yeah, that's right. Handle it.

1350
01:22:09,346 --> 01:22:12,891
<i>- Y'all see what I gotta put up with?
- Percy, come on outta here.</i>

1351
01:22:12,975 --> 01:22:18,021
Ricky, don't ever get married.
Stay young and single as long as you can.

1352
01:22:18,105 --> 01:22:20,691
<i>- Trust me. Take it from an old man.
- Don't worry.</i>

1353
01:22:20,774 --> 01:22:23,318
- Percy!
- All right!

1354
01:22:23,402 --> 01:22:25,904
Damn!

1355
01:22:33,036 --> 01:22:36,039
You know what?
This is crazy.

1356
01:22:38,917 --> 01:22:42,004
I just finished beggin' a review board
to keep this store open.

1357
01:22:45,048 --> 01:22:47,009
And for what?

1358
01:22:47,050 --> 01:22:50,095
For this?

1359
01:22:52,264 --> 01:22:56,935
I'm fightin'... for this.

1360
01:23:02,107 --> 01:23:04,359
Come on, Trey. Let's go.

1361
01:23:04,443 --> 01:23:06,904
Review board? What...
What's she talkin' about?

1362
01:23:06,987 --> 01:23:09,865
<i>Jen, well, how'd it go?</i>

1363
01:23:11,283 --> 01:23:14,036
- We lost, Lashaunna.
- Damn.

1364
01:23:15,078 --> 01:23:17,831
I should have told y'all
this before...

1365
01:23:17,915 --> 01:23:20,375
but the government's gonna
shut this building down, all right?

1366
01:23:21,543 --> 01:23:24,004
<i>So you know what?
Y'all go ahead.</i>

1367
01:23:24,087 --> 01:23:28,342
Fight. Fight all you want.
You can rip this place apart...

1368
01:23:28,425 --> 01:23:33,388
because the government is gonna demolish
this building and turn it into a parkin' lot anyway.

1369
01:23:33,430 --> 01:23:35,557
Jenny.

1370
01:23:37,768 --> 01:23:39,728
Go ahead.

1371
01:23:43,649 --> 01:23:45,651
Let's go, Trey.

1372
01:23:46,860 --> 01:23:48,862
- D.D., you son of a...
- Don't start that right now.

1373
01:23:51,448 --> 01:23:54,201
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Get out! Get out!

1374
01:24:06,213 --> 01:24:08,215
Hey, what up? This is Jenny.

1375
01:24:08,298 --> 01:24:10,968
If I'm not here,
I'm at the beauty shop doin' things.

1376
01:24:11,051 --> 01:24:14,263
- So hit me down there. Peace.

1377
01:24:14,346 --> 01:24:20,269
Jenny. Jenny, I know you're there.
Please pick up. Let me explain.

1378
01:24:20,310 --> 01:24:25,440
<i>- All right, this is my third time calling.</i>

1379
01:24:25,482 --> 01:24:28,402
<i>You know my number.
Just call me.</i>

1380
01:24:41,373 --> 01:24:43,417
I'm ready.

1381
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:46,378
- Ready for what, baby?
- You're not gonna give me my whuppin'?

1382
01:24:48,172 --> 01:24:52,301
To be honest with you, Trey, I don't feel
like givin' out no whuppings right now.

1383
01:24:52,342 --> 01:24:56,805
- I'm cool with that.
- Yeah. I'm sure you are.

1384
01:24:56,889 --> 01:25:01,101
- Oh, I made you somethin' to eat too.
- Oh, yeah?

1385
01:25:02,269 --> 01:25:04,980
- What you make me to eat?
- A bologna sandwich.

1386
01:25:07,441 --> 01:25:09,985
All right.

1387
01:25:20,454 --> 01:25:26,126
<i>I figured I'd chip in and help,
since I know you wasn't feeling well.</i>

1388
01:25:29,588 --> 01:25:31,590
Come here.

1389
01:25:36,261 --> 01:25:38,639
- I love you, Trey.
- I love you too, Mom.

1390
01:25:42,267 --> 01:25:46,271
Man, now that the shop is closin'...

1391
01:25:46,355 --> 01:25:48,273
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

1392
01:25:48,357 --> 01:25:50,275
Me either.

1393
01:25:51,401 --> 01:25:54,363
I'm missin' this place already.

1394
01:25:54,446 --> 01:25:57,741
Doin' hair kept me off the streets.

1395
01:25:59,117 --> 01:26:02,287
Without the beauty shop,
what do I have?

1396
01:26:02,371 --> 01:26:05,707
<i>I have nothin'.</i>

1397
01:26:05,749 --> 01:26:09,378
Perce, what you doin' here? You better not
let your wife catch you back here.

1398
01:26:09,419 --> 01:26:11,880
Hey, "I" run things, okay?

1399
01:26:11,922 --> 01:26:14,258
Oh, no, no.

1400
01:26:14,299 --> 01:26:18,887
Yeah, um, for real.
Um, I gotta be home in an hour.

1401
01:26:18,971 --> 01:26:23,100
- What?
- Hey, don't go lookin' at me like that, youngblood.

1402
01:26:23,183 --> 01:26:28,730
Every married man knows that after
you say, "I do," you don't run a damn thing.

1403
01:26:28,772 --> 01:26:31,400
Okay. Ain't that the truth.

1404
01:26:31,441 --> 01:26:34,194
Look, I just wanted to...

1405
01:26:34,278 --> 01:26:38,157
tellJenny that I heard the news,
and I'm... I'm sorry.

1406
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:41,910
<i>Uh, this place has meant
a whole lot to me...</i>

1407
01:26:41,994 --> 01:26:44,246
just like, I'm sure,
it's meant a whole lot to y'all.

1408
01:26:46,915 --> 01:26:51,128
- I've been here for 15 years.
- Hmm. I've been here for seven.

1409
01:26:53,964 --> 01:26:58,927
<i>As much as we... fuss and fight,
to some degree, y'all like my family.</i>

1410
01:26:58,969 --> 01:27:01,597
Aw, D.D.

1411
01:27:05,767 --> 01:27:11,648
I remember
when this street was brand-new...

1412
01:27:11,732 --> 01:27:13,859
<i>and people took pride
in their community.</i>

1413
01:27:13,942 --> 01:27:18,739
And now...
nobody gives a damn, man.

1414
01:27:30,709 --> 01:27:35,506
Mmm-mmm-hmm. Mama's
good old-fashioned milk shake.

1415
01:27:35,547 --> 01:27:37,716
You know, your grandmother
used to make these for me.

1416
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:41,178
- I want some strawberries in mine.
- You got it.

1417
01:27:41,261 --> 01:27:44,014
Two for you...

1418
01:27:45,265 --> 01:27:47,810
<i>pow... and one for me.</i>

1419
01:27:49,895 --> 01:27:55,234
Ma, I'm ready to tell you
why I was fightin' in school today.

1420
01:27:56,735 --> 01:27:59,238
Okay.

1421
01:27:59,321 --> 01:28:04,535
It all started in history class.
We were talkin' about American history...

1422
01:28:04,618 --> 01:28:10,541
and EddieJones said, black people
ain't do nothin' to add to the American history.

1423
01:28:10,624 --> 01:28:15,879
<i>He said his daddy said we're nothing but slaves.
We ain't doin'nothing important.</i>

1424
01:28:15,963 --> 01:28:19,675
<i>And that's when I called him
and "his daddy a liar."</i>

1425
01:28:19,716 --> 01:28:23,887
And that's when he called "me" a liar.
And that's when I popped him in the mouth.

1426
01:28:26,140 --> 01:28:29,560
- You popped him in the mouth?
- Yep. Three times: two lefts and one right.

1427
01:28:29,601 --> 01:28:32,563
<i>And then his mouth swole up
and he started to cry.</i>

1428
01:28:32,646 --> 01:28:35,941
And then the teacher
told me to apologize.

1429
01:28:36,024 --> 01:28:38,277
<i>And I said no.</i>

1430
01:28:41,238 --> 01:28:45,868
Ma, we ain't do nothing important
in American history?

1431
01:28:48,120 --> 01:28:52,541
Of course we did.
We did a lot of things.

1432
01:28:52,583 --> 01:28:55,544
Come here.
Let me show you somethin'.

1433
01:29:00,048 --> 01:29:04,052
A lot of black people have contributed
to this country, all right?

1434
01:29:04,094 --> 01:29:08,098
And sometimes you don't have to be real big
to make a difference.

1435
01:29:08,182 --> 01:29:12,019
I want you to remember
that the little man counts too.

1436
01:29:12,102 --> 01:29:17,274
So the next time that EddieJones
says that to you...

1437
01:29:17,357 --> 01:29:20,152
I want you to tell him this:

1438
01:29:20,235 --> 01:29:25,574
All right, back in 1871,
we had seven black congressmen... seven.

1439
01:29:25,616 --> 01:29:29,953
And in 1893, a black man by the name
of Dr. Daniel Hale Williams...

1440
01:29:30,037 --> 01:29:32,414
did the first successful
open-heart surgery.

1441
01:29:32,456 --> 01:29:34,791
He wouldn't even be able
to ride his bike...

1442
01:29:34,833 --> 01:29:38,921
because a black man named IsaacJohnson
invented the bike frame.

1443
01:29:39,004 --> 01:29:41,215
And if he went inside, he'd be hot...

1444
01:29:41,298 --> 01:29:45,427
because a black man by the name of
FrederickJones invented the air conditioner.

1445
01:29:45,469 --> 01:29:48,639
Tell him he wouldn't even be able to play
his Nintendo game...

1446
01:29:48,722 --> 01:29:53,477
because a black man named Granville T. Woods
invented the electrolyte battery.

1447
01:29:53,560 --> 01:29:55,646
We've contributed
in a lot of ways.

1448
01:29:55,729 --> 01:29:59,191
<i>A black man invented
the modern-day fuse, the fountain pen...</i>

1449
01:29:59,274 --> 01:30:01,652
the gas mask,
air brakes for buses...

1450
01:30:01,693 --> 01:30:06,281
<i>the rotary engine, automatic transmission
on cars, the traffic light...</i>

1451
01:30:06,365 --> 01:30:10,577
Shoot, we did a whole bunch of stuff.

1452
01:30:10,661 --> 01:30:14,289
Tell him he wouldn't even be able
to use the bathroom, because a black man...

1453
01:30:14,373 --> 01:30:16,708
named J.B. Rhodes
invented the toilet.

1454
01:30:21,171 --> 01:30:23,882
- He couldn't use the toilet?
- He sure couldn't.

1455
01:30:23,966 --> 01:30:25,968
Listen to me.

1456
01:30:28,554 --> 01:30:30,806
We've contributed a lot
to American history...

1457
01:30:30,889 --> 01:30:34,810
so don't you let anybody
tell you we haven't.

1458
01:30:36,812 --> 01:30:40,023
Your grandmama... she used to force me
to read this book all the time.

1459
01:30:40,107 --> 01:30:44,820
- It's all about black history.
- Okay, Jenny, I know I'm not
supposed to be down here...

1460
01:30:44,903 --> 01:30:46,905
and you have every right
to be mad at me.

1461
01:30:46,989 --> 01:30:50,492
But I'm standin' out in the rain
getting wet in my Armani suit.

1462
01:30:50,534 --> 01:30:56,498
I'm in my Armani suit, getting wet...
standin' outside in the rain in a $1,500 suit.

1463
01:30:56,540 --> 01:30:58,542
I'm not doin' it.

1464
01:31:00,335 --> 01:31:05,007
Just do it. Just do it.
Stop bein' a punk and just do it.

1465
01:31:09,219 --> 01:31:12,014
I'm not doin' it.
I'm not doin' it.

1466
01:31:12,097 --> 01:31:16,727
- Who's that man right there?
- That's Frederick Douglass.
He's a human rights leader.

1467
01:31:16,810 --> 01:31:21,815
- Well, he needs a haircut.
- You ain't lyin'.

1468
01:31:24,485 --> 01:31:27,196
Oh, my gosh.

1469
01:31:27,279 --> 01:31:30,574
<i>- Oh, my goodness.
- That looks like the beauty shop.</i>

1470
01:31:32,493 --> 01:31:35,287
Oh, my God. It sure does, baby.

1471
01:31:35,370 --> 01:31:38,999
Michael, what is the matter with you?

1472
01:31:39,082 --> 01:31:42,377
Just do it.
Just do it.

1473
01:31:42,419 --> 01:31:47,257
Stop bein' a punk and just do it.

1474
01:31:53,764 --> 01:31:55,724
Hold that.

1475
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:02,397
- Jenny, I know this is unorthodox, but l...
- Michael!

1476
01:32:02,439 --> 01:32:06,568
I am so glad to see you. I am so glad to see you.
I gotta show you somethin', okay?

1477
01:32:06,610 --> 01:32:09,655
- Wait. Wait right here. Trey, give me this book.
- Okay.

1478
01:32:09,738 --> 01:32:14,117
Okay. Check this out.
What do you think of that?

1479
01:32:14,201 --> 01:32:17,037
<i>Mmm.</i>

1480
01:32:18,288 --> 01:32:21,333
Frederick Douglass
in front of his house.

1481
01:32:21,416 --> 01:32:23,961
Wait. Is that your shop?

1482
01:32:24,044 --> 01:32:28,006
Yep. That's my shop.

1483
01:32:34,221 --> 01:32:37,975
<i>- What's takin'them so long?
- I don't know.</i>

1484
01:32:38,058 --> 01:32:41,186
You think it'd be rude of me
if I poked my head in, see what's...

1485
01:32:41,270 --> 01:32:45,399
Yeah. We need to just wait forJenny
to come out, all right?

1486
01:32:45,482 --> 01:32:47,818
<i>D.D., if you don't
watch out for my feet, we fightin'.</i>

1487
01:32:47,901 --> 01:32:50,487
- I tell you, boy, if you don't...
- I'm so nervous, I gotta tinkle.

1488
01:32:50,571 --> 01:32:52,614
- You gotta what?
- I gotta pee-pee!

1489
01:32:55,868 --> 01:32:58,328
- Pee-pee! Gotta pee-pee!
- D. D"..."

1490
01:33:17,681 --> 01:33:21,894
Well, in view of the recent information
presented by Miss Smithe...

1491
01:33:21,977 --> 01:33:25,022
in this well-presented package...

1492
01:33:25,105 --> 01:33:29,067
<i>I have no choice but to deny
the D. W.P. 's claim on this property...</i>

1493
01:33:29,151 --> 01:33:32,321
<i>under the grounds
that this may be an historical site.</i>

1494
01:33:39,203 --> 01:33:42,039
- That's what I'm talkin' about!
- We did it! Ooh!

1495
01:33:48,170 --> 01:33:52,174
- We did it! We did it! We did it!
- What you do? What you do?

1496
01:33:52,216 --> 01:33:54,510
- You ain't do nothin'.
- Don't start with me, Miss Thing.

1497
01:33:54,593 --> 01:33:57,763
- Hey, did you have anything to do with...

1498
01:33:57,846 --> 01:34:00,349
- Bob, it's over.
- Okay. Okay, buddy.

1499
01:34:07,231 --> 01:34:09,233
Thank you, Michael.

1500
01:34:09,316 --> 01:34:12,319
No. Thank you.

1501
01:34:14,780 --> 01:34:16,782
You're welcome.

1502
01:34:20,285 --> 01:34:23,997
Hey, wait a minute.

1503
01:34:24,081 --> 01:34:26,917
Hey, now!
Hey, now! Hey, now!

1504
01:34:26,959 --> 01:34:30,379
Hey, now! Hey, now!

1505
01:35:42,284 --> 01:35:45,204
<i>Hey, listen.
Answer me this:</i>

1506
01:35:45,287 --> 01:35:47,956
How come y'all
never have a sale?

1507
01:35:47,998 --> 01:35:51,668
You know, like
"buy one, get one free"?

1508
01:35:51,752 --> 01:35:53,796
- Oh, the ho sto'?
- Yeah!

1509
01:35:53,837 --> 01:35:57,800
The ho sto'! I like that.

1510
01:35:57,841 --> 01:36:00,010
<i>- Damn. My feet are killing me.
- Whoo!</i>

1511
01:36:00,093 --> 01:36:03,055
Yeah? Well, baby,
here come your pimp.

1512
01:36:03,138 --> 01:36:05,974
<i>- Here come your pimp.
- No, no, no. Here come your pimp.</i>

1513
01:36:06,016 --> 01:36:09,686
- Here come your pimp.
- Sittin' down on the job? Y'all sittin' down? Huh?

1514
01:36:12,731 --> 01:36:14,858
Say, Silk!

1515
01:36:14,942 --> 01:36:17,694
- Leave 'em alone!
- Get over here!

1516
01:36:17,778 --> 01:36:22,157
<i>Get over here!</i>

1517
01:36:22,199 --> 01:36:24,159
Hey, Silk.
Leave 'em alone, man!

1518
01:36:24,201 --> 01:36:27,538
Or what? Huh?
What you gonna do?

1519
01:36:27,621 --> 01:36:30,082
Oh! Oh, no!

1520
01:36:30,165 --> 01:36:33,335
<i>- That's what I'm gonna do. Right there.
- Damn!</i>

1521
01:36:33,377 --> 01:36:38,841
He got knocked the fuck out!

1522
01:36:38,924 --> 01:36:43,428
Oh, hey, go call an ambulance!
Go call the police!

1523
01:36:43,512 --> 01:36:47,599
Go! Hurry up!
Hurry up! Go call somebody.

1524
01:36:47,683 --> 01:36:50,978
Quick! Get 'em here.

1525
01:36:51,061 --> 01:36:53,021
Mmm. Oh, "ja."

1526
01:36:54,189 --> 01:36:56,108
Mmm. Oh.

1527
01:36:59,027 --> 01:37:03,407
Oh, my goodness. I knew it!
I knew you was into white girls.

1528
01:37:03,448 --> 01:37:05,409
- Don't say nothin'.
- Ricky?

1529
01:37:05,450 --> 01:37:07,744
- D.D., please don't tell nobody.
- Ricky?

1530
01:37:07,828 --> 01:37:11,915
- What you gonna do for me?
- Whatever you want. What?

1531
01:37:11,999 --> 01:37:16,295
- No! Except that. Go ahead.
Tell whoever you're gonna tell.
- I'm tellin' everybody.

1532
01:37:16,378 --> 01:37:18,464
- Ricky, open door.
- D.D., wait!

1533
01:37:18,547 --> 01:37:22,926
Ricky? Ricky, open door.

1534
01:37:23,010 --> 01:37:25,804
There he is.

1535
01:37:32,686 --> 01:37:35,981
You're on time.

1536
01:37:36,064 --> 01:37:38,567
Yeah. I'm on time.

1537
01:37:38,609 --> 01:37:41,278
- Good.
- But not to pick you up.

1538
01:37:41,361 --> 01:37:45,073
See, I'm tired of you treatin' me the way
you do, and I ain't havin' it no more.

1539
01:37:45,115 --> 01:37:47,576
Ooh.

1540
01:37:49,495 --> 01:37:52,498
That's all you.

1541
01:37:52,581 --> 01:37:54,333
Bye.

1542
01:37:54,416 --> 01:37:56,668
What am I supposed
to do with this?

1543
01:37:56,752 --> 01:38:01,298
I don't know. Maybe do like Erykah Badu say.

1544
01:38:01,381 --> 01:38:04,426
- But you can't use my phone.
- Can't use it.

1545
01:38:06,970 --> 01:38:10,265
Bye, Mr. Man.
Rrrrr. What?

1546
01:38:10,349 --> 01:38:14,311
- Take it, gas station man!
- Stop, D.D.

1547
01:38:18,398 --> 01:38:21,860
My two most favorite men
in the world.
