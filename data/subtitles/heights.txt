00:01:09,503 --> 00:01:10,470
Come on! Let's go!

3
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,475
<i>I got him! I got him!</i>

4
00:01:17,344 --> 00:01:18,645
Aah!

5
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:52,079
Shh.

6
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:57,017
Gunter?

7
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:11,999
<i>Guten morgen.</i>

8
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:24,211
<i>Commandant!</i>

9
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:44,264
Let's just get this over with.

10
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,604
Just kill me.

11
00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:54,007
He wants to hear you squeal
like a puppy.

12
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:59,999
Beg for your life.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,313
Beg for your life.

14
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:03,749
<i>Herr commandant!</i>

15
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,419
<i>Herr commandant.</i>

16
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:26,338
<i>Get down! Get down!</i>

17
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:27,674
Get back!

18
00:03:29,443 --> 00:03:29,999
Now it's your turn
to do some begging.

19
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,510
Now it's your turn
to do some begging.

20
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:33,180
Please!

21
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:52,131
Mom, this really isn't
a good time.

22
00:03:52,132 --> 00:03:53,466
Tell your mother to pick us up
in an hour.

23
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:54,700
In an hour,
you'll still be dead.

24
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:56,202
Can you pick me
and dad up in an hour?

25
00:03:56,203 --> 00:03:57,503
And you're not even
supposed to have that.

26
00:03:57,504 --> 00:03:59,238
I'm busy right now.
I can't talk.

27
00:03:59,239 --> 00:03:59,999
Like you're one to talk
about the rules.

28
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,207
Like you're one to talk
about the rules.

29
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:02,541
Excuse me? Listen.

30
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:05,111
It's not my fault you guys suck, okay?
<i>Goodbye, mom.</i>

31
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:06,446
<i>It's not my fault. Goodbye!</i>

32
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:09,648
- Pull back!
- Pull back!

33
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:11,017
There's too many!

34
00:04:17,124 --> 00:04:19,225
<i>That's it for today, folks.</i>

35
00:04:19,226 --> 00:04:22,161
<i>Join us next week for the
attack on the siegfried line.</i>

36
00:04:22,162 --> 00:04:23,696
<i>Hey, there, death wish.</i>

37
00:04:23,697 --> 00:04:25,197
You got a name?

38
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:26,398
Bart bowland.

39
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,000
Bart bowland.

40
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:29,999
Name's Kelly ernswiler.

41
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,003
Name's Kelly ernswiler.

42
00:04:30,004 --> 00:04:31,670
Nice to meet you.

43
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:33,206
Same.

44
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:37,009
<i>Whereabouts you live?</i>

45
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,577
Shaker heights.

46
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:41,213
You live in shaker heights?
I'm from the same place.

47
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:42,348
What street?

48
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:43,682
It's outside shaker.

49
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:46,720
But... I go to shaker high.

50
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:52,191
Langley prep.

51
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:54,527
You don't go to Langley.

52
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:55,694
You go to Langley?

53
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:57,429
Well, I would've went
to Langley.

54
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,999
If only my Polo pony
hadn't died.

55
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,200
If only my Polo pony
hadn't died.

56
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:03,736
Kelly, uh...

57
00:05:03,737 --> 00:05:06,472
I've had three complaints
about you today.

58
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:08,207
I mean, you go off script.

59
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:11,177
Y-you steal a uniform
at knifepoint. So?

60
00:05:11,178 --> 00:05:13,445
Well, the brigade's
been talking.

61
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:15,514
And if you don't chill out,

62
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:17,716
we're gonna follow
the regulatory procedures

63
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:19,285
for an official reprimand.

64
00:05:19,286 --> 00:05:22,388
<i>Ooh. The threat of bureaucracy.
You got me shaking.</i>

65
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:26,458
You know, we could all easily
vote to permanently bar you

66
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:27,660
from any further partic--

67
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:29,095
He gets it, Duncan.

68
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:38,038
Don't waste your time.

69
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:42,675
So, is this willys yours?
Oh, yeah.

70
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:46,111
If you're still feeling suicidal, I
can run you over in her if you want.

71
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:47,580
I think the moment's passed.

72
00:05:47,581 --> 00:05:49,081
All right.

73
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:50,382
Can I get a lift, though?

74
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:52,519
Want a lift?

75
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:56,589
I don't get it.

76
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,624
You go to the battles,
but you don't like the rules?

77
00:05:58,625 --> 00:05:59,999
Well, I mean, I never met a rule
I didn't want to break.

78
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,993
Well, I mean, I never met a rule
I didn't want to break.

79
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:02,328
So what's the appeal?

80
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:05,231
Ladies love a man
in uniform, Bart.

81
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:07,399
My Langley uniform
hasn't done much for me.

82
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,969
It's a theory, you know?
It's yet to be proven.

83
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:13,372
<i>♪ Drowning in my ID ♪</i>

84
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,307

85

This is it here.

<i>♪ No matter

87
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:20,379
Oh, well, of course it is.

88
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,549

93
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:37,263
You got quite a crib. You
should come over some time.

94
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:38,698
You can service our lawnmower.

95
00:06:40,367 --> 00:06:43,969
I would, but, uh, then I might
soil my croquet whites.

96
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:46,205
You understand. Yeah.

97
00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:49,175
See you around. All right. I'll
see you next weekend, Bart.

98
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:16,969
Sergeant Keller.

99
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,004
How was the war?

100
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:20,440
We win?

101
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:24,143
I'm making sandwiches
for care house.

102
00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:27,012
Hey, pull up a chair.

103
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:29,014
<i>That's really nice, ming.</i>

104
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:29,999
It's really coming along.

105
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,116
It's really coming along.

106
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:33,552
Son of Eve, you look very dirty.

107
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:35,554
Oh, this is nothing.
You should see the other guy.

108
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:37,089
<i>Don't touch anything, okay?</i>

109
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:39,191
We're getting ready
for the starving artists show.

110
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:40,492
Can I talk to you, please?

111
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:43,329
<i>The gold has to be
more feathery.</i>

112
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,164
Like this. Not gloppy.

113
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:46,598
<i>Okay? Now you try it.</i>

114
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:49,068
Ma, do you know why we never
have food in this house?

115
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:51,203
I'm not having that argument
with you again.

116
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:52,504
Well, I'll tell you why.

117
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:55,240
Ming, now, you remember
what we said about the eyes?

118
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:58,978
They need to have
a little bit more empathy.

119
00:07:58,979 --> 00:07:59,999
<i>We really need people
to feel like this horse</i>

120
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,613
<i>we really need people
to feel like this horse</i>

121
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:03,315
understands them, okay? Uh-huh.

122
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,117
That's why it's our biggest seller.
<i>I'll tell you why.</i>

123
00:08:05,118 --> 00:08:07,152
It's because your husband
comes in here

124
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,054
and steals food
from his own family

125
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:11,156
to feed every druggie
in Cleveland

126
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,358
like it's not a problem.

127
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:14,360
Well, honey,
pick up a paintbrush.

128
00:08:14,361 --> 00:08:15,694
We're ordering pizza later.

129
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:18,197
<i>No.
Some people have to work, mom.</i>

130
00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:21,467
Can you drop this off
at the cleaners for me?

131
00:08:21,468 --> 00:08:23,202
Oh, sweetie,
you know what we said

132
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:24,970
about paying for the war things.

133
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:26,272
<i>We don't support that.</i>

134
00:08:51,431 --> 00:08:53,165
I don't understand
how you can reenact

135
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:55,701
the battle of the bulge
in 72-degree weather.

136
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:58,203
Didn't all those guys
freeze to death?

137
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,999
Well, a portable toilet fell
on a couple of guys.

138
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,274
Well, a portable toilet fell
on a couple of guys.

139
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:04,109
That's disgusting.

140
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,577
Well, war is hell.

141
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:07,680
Well, then why do you do it?

142
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,015
I feel you're never more alive

143
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:12,585
than when you're faced
with simulated death.

144
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:17,190
Maybe I should try it sometime.

145
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:21,393
You're William James Raleigh
of 101st airborne...

146
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:22,728
Hey! Pinned down in noville.

147
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:24,263
The Germans have the
high ground <i>whoa!</i>

148
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:25,697
<i>And are shelling
your position heavily.</i>

149
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:27,666
You're holed up in a stone barn,
running low on ammo. <i>Kelly!</i>

150
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:29,999
The cries of wounded men fill the air
like cries of hungry babies. <i>Ow!</i>

151
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,370
The cries of wounded men fill the air
like cries of hungry babies. <i>Ow!</i>

152
00:09:30,371 --> 00:09:33,172
At 1:00 P.M., you lose radio
contact with headquarters.

153
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:35,107
<i>What do you do? What do you do?
What do you do?</i>

154
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:37,143
Kelly, stop it.

155
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:41,080
Battle of the bulge.

156
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:43,248
Southern shoulder, December '44.

157
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:46,051
Sorry I asked.

158
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:47,586
Hey.

159
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:51,357
<i>At least I wasn't, you know,
restocking rump roasts.</i>

160
00:09:57,697 --> 00:09:59,698
<i>I'd like to remind everybody</i>

161
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:00,000
<i>about our upcoming field trip
to the battlefields.</i>

162
00:10:00,001 --> 00:10:02,534
<i>About our upcoming field trip
to the battlefields.</i>

163
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:07,673
Uh, so far only two of you
have signed up.

164
00:10:07,674 --> 00:10:09,408
<i>Um...</i>

165
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:13,412
Well, anyway, let's, uh,
let's move on to gettysburg.

166
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:15,414
At gettysburg, the union
soldiers,

167
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:19,017
they fought bravely on,
giving their lives

168
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:22,221
so that we may enjoy
the freedoms that we have today.

169
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:24,022
Bullshit.

170
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:26,725
Do you have something to say,
Mr. ernswiler?

171
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:29,999
Excuse me? No.

172
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,029
Excuse me? No.

173
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,531
It seems that you do.

174
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,535
Come on. Isn't your analysis
a tad simplistic?

175
00:10:36,536 --> 00:10:39,371
I mean, maybe for a second-grade
history class, fine.

176
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:42,307
But to characterize the civil
war as some moral struggle, sir?

177
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,377
That's a joke. <i>A joke?</i>

178
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,179
Lance,
you're not helping things.

179
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,715
Da-- Mr. Norway.

180
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:53,452
Well, we -- we --
We all have our own opinions.

181
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:55,287
<i>Opinions? Soldiers were drafted.</i>

182
00:10:55,288 --> 00:10:58,557
And the only ones who didn't have to fight
were the ones that could pay their way out.

183
00:10:58,558 --> 00:10:59,999
Yes.

184
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,460
Yes.

185
00:11:00,461 --> 00:11:03,629
Why don't you ever talk
about the draft riots, huh?

186
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:04,997
<i>Why don't you show slides</i>

187
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:06,732
o-of the victims tortured
and murdered

188
00:11:06,733 --> 00:11:09,334
by the bloodthirsty mob
that was at those draft riots?

189
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,336
<i>How can you teach something</i>

190
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,572
<i>that you don't know
anything about?</i>

191
00:11:13,573 --> 00:11:15,607
Kelly, we have to
stop meeting like this.

192
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:18,343
I mean, it's not my fault
the teachers here suck.

193
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,378
Listen.

194
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:21,580
I know that some
of the teachers around here

195
00:11:21,581 --> 00:11:23,382
can be pretty trying
for you sometimes.

196
00:11:23,383 --> 00:11:27,186
<i>But you've got to learn to work
in the system, not against it.</i>

197
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,287
Why is that?

198
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:29,999
Because growing up is
a hard enough process as it is.

199
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,724
Because growing up is
a hard enough process as it is.

200
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:35,662
Is that what your box
of tissues is for?

201
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:43,135
I see you're not going
to college next year.

202
00:11:43,136 --> 00:11:44,737
What are your plans?

203
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,510
How am I gonna
get through to you?

204
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:54,313
Well, advertising executives
use status and sex

205
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:56,716
to appeal to my demographic.

206
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:05,390
Hey, g.I. Jane.

207
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:08,293
You disrespected my dad.
Give me a break.

208
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:11,530
I think you need to apologize to him.
To that chump? No way.

209
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:13,432
Why are you dicking with me,
you little dick?!

210
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:16,101
You want to play, dickface?

211
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:17,369
Wait.

212
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:20,305
You just used "dick" as a noun,
adjective, and a verb.

213
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:21,440
That's pretty impressive.

214
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:22,976
Thank you.

215
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,110
Okay.

216
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:27,346
Let's see what
little beetle Bailey

217
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:29,999
keeps in his knapsack
that makes him so intelligent.

218
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,016
Keeps in his knapsack
that makes him so intelligent.

219
00:12:31,017 --> 00:12:33,018
Yard-sale crap!

220
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:34,286
Stop!

221
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:37,190
Hey, private!
Thanks for the hat.

222
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:58,410
<i>♪ Today is gonna be
a beautiful day ♪</i>

223
00:12:58,411 --> 00:12:59,999
No. Come on!

224
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,246
No. Come on!

225
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:03,548
Foxy, it's me. Please.

226
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:05,284
Don't do this to me!

227
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,720
<i>♪ ...the usual thing ♪</i>

228
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:14,727
<i>♪ don't dare waste your time ♪</i>

229
00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:21,400
<i>♪ Yesterday ♪</i>

230
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:25,037
<i>♪ no more waiting
for the usual thing ♪</i>

231
00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:28,206
Keep moving, assholes.
Nothing to see here.

232
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:29,574
<i>Nice one.</i>

233
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:30,000
They should transfer you
to the signal corps.

234
00:13:30,001 --> 00:13:32,478
They should transfer you
to the signal corps.

235
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:38,717
What happened?

236
00:13:38,718 --> 00:13:41,687
Oh, man. Where do I start?

237
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:43,989
<i>Well, I can't do anything
about your Jeep.</i>

238
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,592
<i>But I can probably find you
another hat.</i>

239
00:13:49,729 --> 00:13:51,663
Oh.

240
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,131
What?

241
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:54,633
Very impressive, man.

242
00:13:54,634 --> 00:13:57,169
My dad's really into collecting.

243
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,604
What the hell?

244
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:00,000
What's this?

245
00:14:00,001 --> 00:14:00,706
What's this?

246
00:14:00,707 --> 00:14:02,607
It's Grant's field flask.

247
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:05,210
<i>He never went into battle
without it.</i>

248
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:06,211
You know what?

249
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:08,013
Oh!

250
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:10,215
Your dad should really meet
my history teacher.

251
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:12,284
The guy sent me
up the river today

252
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:16,088
for questioning his g-rated
interpretation of the civil war.

253
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:17,589
Here.

254
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:20,660
Take this. It'll shut him up.

255
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:23,495
Stonewall Jackson's.

256
00:14:23,496 --> 00:14:25,497
What?

257
00:14:25,498 --> 00:14:27,366
My dad's got so much junk
crammed in here

258
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,334
he doesn't even notice
when it's missing.

259
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:29,999
Before this,
it was antique duck decoys.

260
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,504
Before this,
it was antique duck decoys.

261
00:14:32,505 --> 00:14:34,506
Ah, here it is.

262
00:14:34,507 --> 00:14:36,408
I think it was Montgomery's.

263
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:38,276
It's yours now.

264
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:39,378
Are you serious?

265
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:41,113
- Yeah.
<i>- Bart?</i>

266
00:14:41,114 --> 00:14:41,747
<i>Bart?</i>

267
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:44,049
Hey, dad. Hmm.

268
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:47,419
I was just, um, showing Kelly
some of your pieces.

269
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,187
He's really into this stuff.

270
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:50,523
Oh.

271
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:52,992
<i>Yeah.</i>

272
00:14:55,328 --> 00:14:58,630
Is -- is that a... A field stool
from the New York 3rd?

273
00:14:58,631 --> 00:14:59,999
My great-great-grandfather
was in the New York 3rd.

274
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,966
My great-great-grandfather
was in the New York 3rd.

275
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:02,501
That's amazing.

276
00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:05,270
Kelly. Nice to meet you.

277
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:06,438
Nice to meet you.

278
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:08,140
It's a pleasure.
Knowledgeable young man.

279
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:09,508
I try.

280
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:12,077
You know, I used to share your
fascination for all things military.

281
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:14,513
Yeah, I can see.

282
00:15:14,514 --> 00:15:15,981
Lately, though,
I've been exploring

283
00:15:15,982 --> 00:15:18,283
a somewhat lighter side
of human culture.

284
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:20,085
Come on.

285
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:23,623
Um, I know I don't have to tell you, but
put everything back as you found it.

286
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:28,226
<i>The origin of nesting dolls
is shrouded in mystery.</i>

287
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:29,999
Some say the oldest
are from China.

288
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,296
Some say the oldest
are from China.

289
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:33,265
Still others say Japan.

290
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:36,201
<i>I don't have any of those, but the
ones I do have are from Russia.</i>

291
00:15:36,202 --> 00:15:40,672
And the Russians perfected
the art of nesting dolls.

292
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:42,407
Now, this particular one here,

293
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:45,110
this is the crown Jewel
of my collection.

294
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:47,145
It has 13 levels,

295
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:51,283
going all the way down
to the teeny tiniest.

296
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:53,985
The baby.

297
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:55,287
Ruby.

298
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:57,756
Ruby. Huh.

299
00:15:57,757 --> 00:15:59,999
Yeah. It's silly.
I call her Ruby.

300
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,057
Yeah. It's silly.
I call her Ruby.

301
00:16:00,058 --> 00:16:02,694
Because if you look closely at her two
little eyes, they look like rubies.

302
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:04,463
My little Ruby baby.

303
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:08,067
Whoa! Oh, good god.

304
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:11,571
We should've just taken
the damn hat.

305
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:15,240
We'll get you one.

306
00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:16,475
Ah.

307
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:19,045
I-I, uh, I have to get
a flashlight.

308
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:22,647
So why'd you let someone
take it?

309
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,616
My hat? Oh, I didn't let
anybody take it.

310
00:16:24,617 --> 00:16:27,452
I just, uh, mouthed off
to the wrong person.

311
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:29,999
Sounds like your mouth gets you
in trouble a lot. It does.

312
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,089
Sounds like your mouth gets you
in trouble a lot. It does.

313
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:31,056
Is mom here?

314
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:33,058
I need to go over the music
with her.

315
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:35,193
Does it look like mom's here?

316
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:37,629
Your mom went shopping.
She'll be back in about an hour.

317
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:40,599
Oh, tabby, have you met
Bart's new friend Kelly?

318
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,634
Hi.

319
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:46,438
<i>Whatever you do,
do not give him any money.</i>

320
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:48,006
Hey, shut up.

321
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:51,743
Hey, you shut up.
He's wanted in three states.

322
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:53,078
That's funny.

323
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:55,480
We're paying attention
to you now. You happy?

324
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:56,715
I'm really happy.

325
00:16:56,716 --> 00:16:58,350
I'm gonna go take a bath.

326
00:16:58,351 --> 00:16:59,999
Will you tell me
when miner gets here?

327
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,386
Will you tell me
when miner gets here?

328
00:17:00,387 --> 00:17:02,021
Thank you.

329
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:06,091
Who's miner?

330
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:07,526
Fiance.

331
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:09,528
<i>Aha!</i>

332
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:11,264
Ruby.

333
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:15,267
<i>Oh, you know, that frozen-food lady
came in today again with her kids.</i>

334
00:17:15,268 --> 00:17:17,135
Oh, yeah? <i>They must eat out of</i>

335
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:20,205
those little cardboard trays
every day.

336
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:24,010
I think one of her kids even
looks like a piece of cardboard.

337
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:28,246
You know we have more flavors of cat
food here than we do baby food?

338
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:29,247
Really?

339
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:29,999
<i>Yeah.</i>

340
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,500
<i>Yeah.</i>

341
00:17:31,117 --> 00:17:33,652
What do you think that says
about our culture?

342
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:36,988
I don't know what it says.
What do you think?

343
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:38,490
Mm.

344
00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:41,293
I think working here is
very depressing.

345
00:17:41,294 --> 00:17:43,295
<i>Well, then you should quit.</i>

346
00:17:43,296 --> 00:17:45,564
I mean, you could get
any job you wanted to.

347
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:47,532
You think so? <i>Heck, yeah.</i>

348
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:48,667
Come on.

349
00:17:48,668 --> 00:17:50,702
You're smart.

350
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:52,203
You got a good eye.

351
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:54,673
And you do the best promo stuff
in this store.

352
00:17:54,674 --> 00:17:56,107
Well...

353
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:58,510
I mean, the thing you did
with juice boxes.

354
00:17:58,511 --> 00:17:59,644
That was genius.

355
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:00,000
<i>Thanks.</i>

356
00:18:00,001 --> 00:18:01,146
<i>Thanks.</i>

357
00:18:01,147 --> 00:18:04,482
What are you gonna do? Enlist?

358
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:06,618
In the army?

359
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:08,687
And lose this?

360
00:18:08,688 --> 00:18:10,055
No way.

361
00:18:10,056 --> 00:18:10,755
<i>Hello?! Are you crazy?</i>

362
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,390
No way. Not happening.

363
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:13,525
Unh-unh. Hello?

364
00:18:13,526 --> 00:18:15,560
If the store is closed,

365
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:18,697
it shouldn't have a sign
that says 24 hours!

366
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:20,098
Okay. I'll be right there.

367
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,968
I don't want to be here
when my coupons expire.

368
00:18:22,969 --> 00:18:24,470
Okay.

369
00:18:39,185 --> 00:18:41,019
Morning, private Ryan.

370
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:43,054
Like my new hat?

371
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:45,023
Yeah, actually.
I got one just like it.

372
00:18:45,024 --> 00:18:46,725
It's just mine's
infested with lice.

373
00:18:46,726 --> 00:18:49,295
Really? You're just a regular
carrot top, aren't you?

374
00:18:51,764 --> 00:18:53,065
Oh, my god.

375
00:18:55,034 --> 00:18:57,569
<i>You know, one day,
me and you are gonna be alone.</i>

376
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:59,170
Won't that be nice?

377
00:18:59,171 --> 00:18:59,999
Too bad my mom
won't let me date yet, huh?

378
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,339
Too bad my mom
won't let me date yet, huh?

379
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,308
<i>That's a good one, buddy.
You got dental insurance?</i>

380
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:06,044
Why do you mess with him?
You're right.

381
00:19:06,045 --> 00:19:08,347
I should give him a break.
I mean it.

382
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:12,517
<i>The allies launched
a counteroffensive</i>

383
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:14,019
<i>two days before the new year.</i>

384
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,488
Kelly, you're home.
Thank goodness.

385
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:18,056
<i>Move.</i>

386
00:19:18,057 --> 00:19:19,758
I need you to go
to the art supply store for me.

387
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:21,326
I'm not going. Get Abe to do it.

388
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:24,730
Abe was going -- he had to lead
a meeting at care house.

389
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:28,066
What do you need?

390
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:29,999
I phoned in the order.

391
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,202
I phoned in the order.

392
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:32,470
Is it a big order?

393
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:34,973
No. Thank you.

394
00:19:34,974 --> 00:19:37,109
It better not be a big order.

395
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,469
<i>Kelly, right?</i>

396
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:05,738
Hi.

397
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:11,543
Uh, so they're having
a glitter sale... Looks like.

398
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:13,344
What happened to you?

399
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:15,113
What happened --
Oh, my eye.

400
00:20:15,114 --> 00:20:17,549
Uh, I had a tennis injury
a while back.

401
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,718
No big thing.

402
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:25,423
So, you paint?

403
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:29,027
Uh, yeah, y-you know.
It's a weird question to ask.

404
00:20:29,028 --> 00:20:29,999
How so?

405
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,263
How so?

406
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:34,099
I don't feel comfortable
calling anything done

407
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,301
since the renaissance
painting, you know?

408
00:20:36,302 --> 00:20:38,269
<i>I mean, we might have
more experimental interaction</i>

409
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,638
with the picture plane,
but as far as skills go,

410
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:42,707
you know, we're suffering
a great deal.

411
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:44,109
Okay.

412
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:46,711
Uh, so, uh, I-i got a question.

413
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:49,013
<i>I see you're working
with acrylics.</i>

414
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:51,683
Mm-hmm. Why? Isn't
oil much richer?

415
00:20:51,684 --> 00:20:53,451
Oh, not another oil snob.

416
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:57,021
I'm not an oil snob. It's just
isn't acrylic a bit jejune?

417
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:58,289
Jejune?

418
00:20:58,290 --> 00:20:59,691
Yeah. Well, it means --

419
00:20:59,692 --> 00:21:00,000
I know what it means.

420
00:21:00,001 --> 00:21:01,427
I know what it means.

421
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:08,666
How old are you, anyway?

422
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:10,535
Older than my years.

423
00:21:10,536 --> 00:21:12,370
Really? Yeah.

424
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:14,139
And you paint?

425
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,007
Well, you know, my mom's
an artist, so I --

426
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:18,977
Oh, that explains it.

427
00:21:18,978 --> 00:21:20,712
That explains --
What does that explain?

428
00:21:20,713 --> 00:21:22,413
<i>Wait, wait, wait.</i>

429
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:25,083
Doesn't anybody believe in
innate knowledge anymore?

430
00:21:25,084 --> 00:21:28,019
I mean, you know, Michelangelo
was 15 when he painted the inf--

431
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,988
Uh, far-- far--
Farness.

432
00:21:29,989 --> 00:21:29,998
The infanta. Fanta.
That's what I meant.

433
00:21:29,999 --> 00:21:31,456
The infanta. Fanta.
That's what I meant.

434
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:34,058
Well, actually,
infantas are Spanish.

435
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:35,493
Michelangelo was Italian.

436
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:38,329
Spanish, yeah.
Well, uh, exactly.

437
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:40,431
Y-you know, one world,
one people.

438
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:43,368
Just like Jesse Jackson
envisioned, you know?

439
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:45,470
Smart guy. Hi, sweetie.

440
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:48,039
Oh, I'm just running errands
right now.

441
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:51,342
Yeah. I should be home
in about an hour.

442
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:53,579
See you later. All right.

443
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:59,999
What the hell did I just say?

444
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,119
What the hell did I just say?

445
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,320
What the hell did I just say?

446
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,189
Jesse Jackson?

447
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:05,624
Christ.

448
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:23,275
Dad?

449
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:29,999
<i>Dad?</i>

450
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,649
<i>Dad?</i>

451
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:34,253
Dad, get up. <i>Aah!</i>

452
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:41,260
Sorry.

453
00:22:46,398 --> 00:22:48,399
Hey, pop.

454
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,968
Keller.

455
00:22:49,969 --> 00:22:52,003
<i>You know, a funny thing
just happened to me.</i>

456
00:22:52,004 --> 00:22:54,539
I thought you were dead
on the couch.

457
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,107
Oh, you mean Emmett.

458
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:59,010
Oh, they didn't have
any empty beds at care house.

459
00:22:59,011 --> 00:22:59,999
<i>Emmett?</i> Uh-huh.

460
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,112
<i>Emmett?</i> Uh-huh.

461
00:23:00,113 --> 00:23:02,280
So you bring him to our house?

462
00:23:02,281 --> 00:23:03,381
Why don't you
ever think about --

463
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:06,217
Maybe he might be dangerous
to me and mom.

464
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:08,586
<i>Hmm?
Or steal all of our furniture.</i>

465
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:10,989
He needed a place
to sleep tonight.

466
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:14,526
Well, having him here makes it
feel more like home, anyway.

467
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:19,297
Hey, I've been straight
for five years, almost six.

468
00:23:19,298 --> 00:23:20,632
That's a third of your life.

469
00:23:20,633 --> 00:23:22,400
Big deal.

470
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,970
I've been straight
the whole time.

471
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:43,655
<i>That there's
actual sand from iwo jima.</i>

472
00:23:43,656 --> 00:23:45,556
Or your sister's fish tank.

473
00:23:45,557 --> 00:23:48,126
<i>Well, it don't come with no
certificate of authenticity.</i>

474
00:23:48,127 --> 00:23:50,295
<i>Actually, I'm in the market
for an airborne cap.</i>

475
00:23:50,296 --> 00:23:53,331
<i>It's for my friend here.</i>

476
00:23:53,332 --> 00:23:56,034
I got one.
Can't sell it to you, though.

477
00:23:56,035 --> 00:23:57,135
You sure?

478
00:23:57,136 --> 00:23:59,003
Has a lot of sentimental value.

479
00:23:59,004 --> 00:23:59,999
Yeah. How much?

480
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,105
Yeah. How much?

481
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,308
A lot.

482
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,514
What's this?

483
00:24:09,515 --> 00:24:14,086
General ulysses s. Grant's
field flask, my friend.

484
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,622
And if that's the collected works
of baudelaire, throw it in.

485
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:19,425
We'll call it even.

486
00:24:21,593 --> 00:24:24,062
Listen, Bart.
I really don't need it that bad.

487
00:24:24,063 --> 00:24:26,331
No worries.

488
00:24:26,332 --> 00:24:28,166
See, you got it all wrong.

489
00:24:28,167 --> 00:24:29,999
War is just failed diplomacy.

490
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,035
War is just failed diplomacy.

491
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:33,538
Well, if you hate it so much, why
do you keep going to the battles?

492
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:35,740
Mm.

493
00:24:35,741 --> 00:24:38,142
It looks good
on college applications.

494
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:39,477
You're going to college?

495
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,546
I got no choice.

496
00:24:41,547 --> 00:24:42,613
Mm.

497
00:24:42,614 --> 00:24:44,248
What happened to your face?

498
00:24:44,249 --> 00:24:45,450
Oh.

499
00:24:45,451 --> 00:24:48,486
Uh, remember that guy Lance
I told you about?

500
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:49,587
The same guy?

501
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:51,756
<i>He's one pissed off
little munchkin.</i>

502
00:24:51,757 --> 00:24:54,225
What are you gonna do about it?

503
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:55,326
Nothing.

504
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:58,229
Nothing?
W-what do you mean, nothing?

505
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,999
On the battlefield, you were running
around like Rambo on steroids.

506
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,599
On the battlefield, you were running
around like Rambo on steroids.

507
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,736
That's different. I mean, that's
just playing around, you know?

508
00:25:04,737 --> 00:25:06,571
So?

509
00:25:06,572 --> 00:25:10,041
Haven't you ever heard of the
193rd special operations wing?

510
00:25:10,042 --> 00:25:11,442
Never.

511
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:13,244
You want to get this guy?

512
00:25:13,245 --> 00:25:14,479
<i>Target?</i>

513
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,014
<i>Lance Norway.</i>

514
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:17,015
<i>Objective?</i>

515
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:18,616
Humiliation.

516
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:21,319
Rage. Despair.

517
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,653
Easy enough.

518
00:25:22,654 --> 00:25:26,090
Nam's probably our go-to war
for that sort of thing. Okay.

519
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:27,392
I got the declassified briefs

520
00:25:27,393 --> 00:25:29,560
from the Phoenix project
around here.

521
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:30,000
I knew my dad's crap
would come in handy.

522
00:25:30,001 --> 00:25:32,030
I knew my dad's crap
would come in handy.

523
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:33,131
Hey, guys.

524
00:25:33,132 --> 00:25:35,333
I've got some stretcher bars
out in my car.

525
00:25:35,334 --> 00:25:37,035
Do you think one of you
can help me bring them in?

526
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:38,703
Of course.

527
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:42,206
We'll drop what we're doing because what
you're doing must be more important.

528
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:43,441
It is.

529
00:25:43,442 --> 00:25:45,176
Sure.

530
00:25:45,177 --> 00:25:47,678
I mean, uh, I'll help.

531
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,113
<i>Thanks.</i>

532
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:50,648
What is your...

533
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:53,052
I'll find those reports.

534
00:26:02,428 --> 00:26:04,997
Perfect. Thanks.

535
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,705
It's the waterfront.

536
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:17,642
No. As the viewer,
I get to decide what it is.

537
00:26:17,643 --> 00:26:20,011
And it doesn't look anything
like a waterfront to me.

538
00:26:20,012 --> 00:26:22,480
It's the light.
I was playing with diffusion.

539
00:26:22,481 --> 00:26:25,049
Put it away when you're done
with it, all right?

540
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:27,419
Very funny.

541
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:29,999
This is really nice, though.

542
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,022
This is really nice, though.

543
00:26:30,023 --> 00:26:32,590
It must be nice to have a place
like this to get away to, huh?

544
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:35,461
Yeah, it is. It's great.

545
00:26:37,296 --> 00:26:39,363
So, w-what about farmer?

546
00:26:39,364 --> 00:26:41,299
Farmer?

547
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,000
Yeah, the boyfriend.

548
00:26:43,001 --> 00:26:44,001
Miner?

549
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:45,269
Miner. I'm sorry.

550
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,139
<i>Miner. Okay.</i>

551
00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:51,209
Well, what about --
Is -- is he an artist, too?

552
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:54,245
So, you said your mom
was a painter?

553
00:26:54,246 --> 00:26:56,114
Oh, she used to be.

554
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:58,015
She -- she still is, I guess.

555
00:26:58,016 --> 00:26:59,999
Uh, she had to turn it into
a business, so, you know --

556
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,385
Uh, she had to turn it into
a business, so, you know --

557
00:27:00,386 --> 00:27:01,586
'cause my dad stopped working.

558
00:27:01,587 --> 00:27:03,988
So now we got this -- this
family of Chinese immigrants

559
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:05,690
living in the house,
making them for her.

560
00:27:05,691 --> 00:27:08,025
Kind of like
Andy warhol's factory?

561
00:27:08,026 --> 00:27:09,594
No, not his factory.

562
00:27:09,595 --> 00:27:14,332
More like, uh, more like
Andy warhol's toolshed.

563
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:16,701
<i>It's nice, though, you know?
I'm not -- I'm not dissing it.</i>

564
00:27:16,702 --> 00:27:18,503
<i>I used to have my playpen
in her studio.</i>

565
00:27:18,504 --> 00:27:21,507
Huh.
So, why'd your dad stop working?

566
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:26,445
H-he's a vh1 documentary
without the music.

567
00:27:27,746 --> 00:27:28,746
Damn it, Kelly.

568
00:27:28,747 --> 00:27:29,999
<i>I can't plan your revenge
by myself.</i>

569
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,349
<i>I can't plan your revenge
by myself.</i>

570
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:33,317
Come on!

571
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:34,685
Have fun, boys.

572
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:37,255
Fun. If only war were fun.

573
00:27:37,256 --> 00:27:39,591
War is deadly serious, ma'am.

574
00:27:42,728 --> 00:27:44,595
You know, I'm kind of worried

575
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:47,331
about you playing
with diffusion unsupervised.

576
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,066
Are you? <i>Yeah.</i>

577
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:53,204
Might have to come by and show you
some of the proper safety procedures.

578
00:27:53,205 --> 00:27:56,508
I don't think I have room
in here for a playpen.

579
00:28:06,218 --> 00:28:08,786
<i>Hey, Sarah, wait up. Wait up. Uh,
do you got the math homework?</i>

580
00:28:09,102 --> 00:28:10,236
<i>Why? So you can cheat?</i>

581
00:28:10,237 --> 00:28:11,304
<i>Well, yeah. Can I?</i>

582
00:28:11,305 --> 00:28:12,538
<i>No.</i>

583
00:28:12,539 --> 00:28:14,307
<i>Um, but I-I'll tell you what.</i>

584
00:28:14,308 --> 00:28:17,543
I have, um, an extra ticket
to aerosmith on Friday night.

585
00:28:17,544 --> 00:28:20,213
Is that gonna be loud?

586
00:28:20,214 --> 00:28:23,549
Yeah. I-it's gonna be loud.
It's music.

587
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:25,519
Yeah.

588
00:28:26,753 --> 00:28:29,355
Well, you know, it might be
really good for you to get out

589
00:28:29,356 --> 00:28:29,999
and mingle
with some normal people.

590
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,557
And mingle
with some normal people.

591
00:28:31,558 --> 00:28:34,660
Something could rub off
on you... I hope.

592
00:28:34,661 --> 00:28:37,997
Well, we'll talk about it
on the night shift, yes?

593
00:28:37,998 --> 00:28:39,166
Okay.

594
00:28:44,404 --> 00:28:46,038
<i>Citizens,</i>

595
00:28:46,039 --> 00:28:48,407
<i>this is the emergency broadcast
notification system.</i>

596
00:28:48,408 --> 00:28:50,409
This is not a test
of the system.

597
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:52,111
<i>This is an actual no--</i>

598
00:28:52,112 --> 00:28:53,713
Damn.

599
00:28:53,714 --> 00:28:56,015
That was pretty good
except for the end.

600
00:28:56,016 --> 00:28:57,316
Nah.

601
00:28:57,317 --> 00:28:59,719
Don't you love being a minor?
I mean, think about it.

602
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,000
There's no consequences
for illegal activities.

603
00:29:00,001 --> 00:29:02,388
There's no consequences
for illegal activities.

604
00:29:02,389 --> 00:29:04,557
You're not responsible
if the economy goes bad.

605
00:29:04,558 --> 00:29:06,993
<i>No drinking. No credit.</i>

606
00:29:06,994 --> 00:29:09,595
No freedom.
At least not in my house.

607
00:29:09,596 --> 00:29:11,998
You know, you talk about it,
but I never see it.

608
00:29:11,999 --> 00:29:14,400
My parents do their best work
without an audience.

609
00:29:14,401 --> 00:29:17,704
Oh, yeah? Like what?

610
00:29:18,705 --> 00:29:21,374
Do you think I picked dartmouth?

611
00:29:21,375 --> 00:29:22,575
You didn't pick it?

612
00:29:22,576 --> 00:29:24,444
No.

613
00:29:25,445 --> 00:29:26,746
What about tabby?

614
00:29:26,747 --> 00:29:28,347
Tabby.

615
00:29:28,348 --> 00:29:29,999
She got to go where she wanted.
Sarah Lawrence.

616
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,250
She got to go where she wanted.
Sarah Lawrence.

617
00:29:31,251 --> 00:29:33,653
Six years.

618
00:29:33,654 --> 00:29:36,756
She's going to grad school,
though. Yale.

619
00:29:36,757 --> 00:29:38,691
She goes to Yale?

620
00:29:38,692 --> 00:29:41,495
Wow. I didn't even think
people went to Yale.

621
00:29:42,329 --> 00:29:47,033
Well, she drives off in her car
in September.

622
00:29:47,034 --> 00:29:49,702
<i>But for all we know,
she pulls over in Albany</i>

623
00:29:49,703 --> 00:29:52,371
and sleeps there until may.

624
00:29:52,372 --> 00:29:54,440
What do you mean?

625
00:29:54,441 --> 00:29:56,108
Joke.

626
00:29:56,109 --> 00:29:58,744
That was a joke? That's
what they sound like? <i>Yeah.</i>

627
00:29:58,745 --> 00:29:59,999
For some reason, I always
thought they'd be funnier.

628
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,613
For some reason, I always
thought they'd be funnier.

629
00:30:00,614 --> 00:30:03,049
Well...

630
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:05,686
Wait. I-isn't Sarah Lawrence
a school for lesbians?

631
00:30:07,454 --> 00:30:09,089
How's their football team?

632
00:30:12,326 --> 00:30:14,493
<i>Vermont!</i>

633
00:30:14,494 --> 00:30:16,028
<i>Oh, remember the milbecks' place</i>

634
00:30:16,029 --> 00:30:18,331
<i>in lake champlain, darling?</i>

635
00:30:18,332 --> 00:30:20,466
<i>And what was
that wonderful cheese</i>

636
00:30:20,467 --> 00:30:22,702
<i>that we had on the sandwiches
in the restaurant there?</i>

637
00:30:22,703 --> 00:30:24,203
Gouda.

638
00:30:24,204 --> 00:30:26,005
Yes. Gouda.

639
00:30:26,006 --> 00:30:27,473
Are you sure? Yes. Gouda.

640
00:30:27,474 --> 00:30:29,508
Anyway, the great thing
about middlebury

641
00:30:29,509 --> 00:30:30,000
is that the French department
is awesome.

642
00:30:30,001 --> 00:30:32,078
Is that the French department
is awesome.

643
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:35,014
French. What are you going to do
with that, write poetry?

644
00:30:35,015 --> 00:30:38,084
<i>You know,
they predict that China</i>

645
00:30:38,085 --> 00:30:40,353
is going to be the largest
market of the 21st century.

646
00:30:40,354 --> 00:30:42,088
Maybe I should
take Chinese, then.

647
00:30:42,089 --> 00:30:44,423
<i>Mandarin is actually
the most-spoken dialect.</i>

648
00:30:44,424 --> 00:30:47,159
But the Chinese speak hundreds
of different distinct languages.

649
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,561
<i>Speaking of which, tabby, honey,</i>

650
00:30:48,562 --> 00:30:50,262
have you finished
the seating arrangement yet?

651
00:30:50,263 --> 00:30:53,265
Mom, can we just talk about
something else for once?

652
00:30:53,266 --> 00:30:56,169
Well, darling, we have to take
the list to the calligrapher.

653
00:30:59,473 --> 00:30:59,999
Hmm.

654
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,173
Hmm.

655
00:31:01,174 --> 00:31:03,377
<i>Tabby?</i>

656
00:31:04,511 --> 00:31:07,346
Well, you know, uh...

657
00:31:07,347 --> 00:31:11,083
Speaking of calligraphy
and the Chinese...

658
00:31:11,084 --> 00:31:13,219
<i>The...</i>

659
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:17,723
The Chinese peoples
invented calligraphy.

660
00:31:17,724 --> 00:31:19,426
They did.

661
00:31:20,594 --> 00:31:24,230
But I-i tend to stray away from
saying, um, "invent" too often

662
00:31:24,231 --> 00:31:27,433
just because it reinforces
patriarchal stereotypes.

663
00:31:27,434 --> 00:31:29,736
<i>As we all know.</i>

664
00:31:32,272 --> 00:31:34,206
Exactly.

665
00:31:34,207 --> 00:31:36,142
Men invent. Women give birth.

666
00:31:36,143 --> 00:31:37,710
<i>Although...</i>

667
00:31:37,711 --> 00:31:40,346
Women invented babies.

668
00:31:40,347 --> 00:31:42,114
<i>Right, uh, but...</i>

669
00:31:42,115 --> 00:31:44,151
Babies gave birth to man.

670
00:31:47,988 --> 00:31:50,523
What an unusual conversation.

671
00:31:50,524 --> 00:31:52,324
Do you have discussions
like this at home

672
00:31:52,325 --> 00:31:53,692
with your family, Kelly?

673
00:31:53,693 --> 00:31:57,196
My family, uh, they're similar.
Little different.

674
00:31:57,197 --> 00:31:59,098
<i>He does know how to talk
about art.</i>

675
00:31:59,099 --> 00:31:59,999
Do you?

676
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,033
Do you?

677
00:32:00,034 --> 00:32:01,367
You do?

678
00:32:01,368 --> 00:32:03,002
Uh, my mother's
kind of an artist.

679
00:32:03,003 --> 00:32:05,304
So I pick up very quickly
on that kind of stuff.

680
00:32:05,305 --> 00:32:07,706
So you come from
a creative family, do you?

681
00:32:07,707 --> 00:32:09,742
I do.

682
00:32:09,743 --> 00:32:11,477
<i>Oh, I wish I could get
my boys to talk to me</i>

683
00:32:11,478 --> 00:32:13,179
<i>about any of my passions.</i>

684
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:15,748
Just try to get them near
the subject of my garden.

685
00:32:15,749 --> 00:32:18,050
Oh. <i>Speaking of, Mrs. bowland,</i>

686
00:32:18,051 --> 00:32:20,286
I saw your magnolias.
Very fine specimens.

687
00:32:20,287 --> 00:32:21,454
<i>Oh, thank you.</i>

688
00:32:21,455 --> 00:32:23,289
They are fine, aren't they?

689
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:25,558
They're gorgeous.

690
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:28,561
I just think that flowers
are so... Sen--

691
00:32:28,562 --> 00:32:29,999
Sensual.

692
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,031
Sensual.

693
00:32:43,143 --> 00:32:45,010
<i>Yep. It looks empty.</i>

694
00:32:45,011 --> 00:32:47,580
<i>Lance must be out torturing
puppies or something.</i>

695
00:32:47,581 --> 00:32:49,049
<i>Let me see.</i>

696
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:56,188
So, you have a thing
for my sister?

697
00:32:56,189 --> 00:32:59,158
What? No.

698
00:32:59,159 --> 00:32:59,999
Everybody does.

699
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,460
Everybody does.

700
00:33:00,461 --> 00:33:03,529
I don't.

701
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:05,397
Bart, I don't.

702
00:33:05,398 --> 00:33:07,500
All right. The coast is clear.

703
00:33:07,501 --> 00:33:09,002
Let's get a closer look.

704
00:33:14,074 --> 00:33:15,509
Come on.

705
00:33:25,085 --> 00:33:27,220
Tabby and I just have
a few things in common.

706
00:33:28,588 --> 00:33:29,999
Oh, really? Like what?

707
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,023
Oh, really? Like what?

708
00:33:31,024 --> 00:33:32,391
Like what?
I can't tell you about that.

709
00:33:32,392 --> 00:33:34,360
It's my feminine side.

710
00:33:34,361 --> 00:33:36,128
You don't wear
women's clothes, do you?

711
00:33:36,129 --> 00:33:38,531
Hey, feeling pretty
is not a crime, all right?

712
00:33:38,532 --> 00:33:40,232
Whatever.

713
00:33:40,233 --> 00:33:42,101
Bart.

714
00:33:42,102 --> 00:33:43,335
<i>Bart, why?</i>

715
00:33:43,336 --> 00:33:46,772
What -- Bart! Bart!

716
00:33:46,773 --> 00:33:48,141
Bart!

717
00:33:55,315 --> 00:33:57,083
Bart!

718
00:33:59,753 --> 00:34:00,000
Can I help you, young man?

719
00:34:00,001 --> 00:34:02,355
Can I help you, young man?

720
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:06,392
Uh, what? What?

721
00:34:06,393 --> 00:34:08,761
Kelly?

722
00:34:08,762 --> 00:34:11,031
Mr. Norway!

723
00:34:11,998 --> 00:34:14,134
I was looking for my Merlin.

724
00:34:15,368 --> 00:34:16,468
Your what?

725
00:34:16,469 --> 00:34:19,338
Uh, I had a box
of purple kiffnits.

726
00:34:19,339 --> 00:34:22,207
My friends threw it over.
A little purple box.

727
00:34:22,208 --> 00:34:23,342
Pardon?

728
00:34:23,343 --> 00:34:25,411
You haven't seen it?
Yeah, I'm coming.

729
00:34:25,412 --> 00:34:27,780
Will you excuse me for a second?

730
00:34:27,781 --> 00:34:29,516
What?

731
00:34:37,390 --> 00:34:39,059
Bart.

732
00:34:44,531 --> 00:34:46,299
Shit.

733
00:34:55,308 --> 00:34:57,210
Bart!

734
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:11,557
Are you crazy? Yes.

735
00:35:11,558 --> 00:35:14,427
But now we know the layout of
the entire house. Come on!

736
00:35:16,029 --> 00:35:19,298
<i>Okay. Duncan said he'd get
like 10 guys to help us out.</i>

737
00:35:19,299 --> 00:35:22,434
<i>Cool. Cool.</i> And one of them's
gonna videotape the whole thing.

738
00:35:22,435 --> 00:35:24,403
And I'll -- I'll tell you
something, Bart.

739
00:35:24,404 --> 00:35:28,340
Is that once we get that tape
played on the school TV station,

740
00:35:28,341 --> 00:35:29,999
it's gonna be all over but the
shouting, you know what I mean?

741
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,210
It's gonna be all over but the
shouting, you know what I mean?

742
00:35:31,211 --> 00:35:34,413
Only a few more days
till the field trip

743
00:35:34,414 --> 00:35:36,181
<i>and operation mincemeat.</i>

744
00:35:36,182 --> 00:35:39,318
To mincemeat.

745
00:35:39,319 --> 00:35:40,452
To enemies.

746
00:35:40,453 --> 00:35:43,122
To enemies, too.

747
00:35:43,123 --> 00:35:44,257
<i>Man.</i>

748
00:35:54,367 --> 00:35:58,337
You know what's funny?
It's funny.

749
00:35:58,338 --> 00:35:59,999
It's like everything was good
for a while, you know?

750
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,506
It's like everything was good
for a while, you know?

751
00:36:00,507 --> 00:36:02,307
Everything was fine.

752
00:36:02,308 --> 00:36:07,246
And then, uh...
I got angry, you know?

753
00:36:07,247 --> 00:36:09,615
<i>At my dad, mostly.</i>

754
00:36:09,616 --> 00:36:11,250
And then I just started...

755
00:36:11,251 --> 00:36:15,054
I just started saying
whatever popped into my head.

756
00:36:15,055 --> 00:36:18,224
And now I... Can't stop.

757
00:36:22,262 --> 00:36:23,663
Know what I mean?

758
00:36:25,765 --> 00:36:29,235
Bart?

759
00:37:04,471 --> 00:37:06,138
Hey.

760
00:37:06,139 --> 00:37:08,174
I warned you I'd come.

761
00:37:17,183 --> 00:37:19,051
All right. I'm gonna go, then.

762
00:37:19,052 --> 00:37:21,120
<i>What do you want?</i>

763
00:37:21,121 --> 00:37:23,656
<i>Um...</i>

764
00:37:24,624 --> 00:37:27,126
Inspiration.

765
00:37:27,127 --> 00:37:28,694
I had this idea for a painting.

766
00:37:28,695 --> 00:37:29,999
Thought maybe I could
come in here and paint it.

767
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,396
Thought maybe I could
come in here and paint it.

768
00:37:31,397 --> 00:37:32,631
Okay.

769
00:37:32,632 --> 00:37:35,167
You can, uh, grab a canvas
in the corner.

770
00:37:35,168 --> 00:37:37,669
<i>There's paintbrushes in the jar.</i>

771
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:39,138
<i>Paint's on the shelves.</i>

772
00:37:39,139 --> 00:37:40,306
Okay.

773
00:37:54,754 --> 00:37:56,421
Oh, I don't have much time --

774
00:37:56,422 --> 00:37:58,557
<i>Am I messing up your concentration,
me being here like this?</i>

775
00:37:58,558 --> 00:37:59,999
No. It's fine.

776
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:00,520
No. It's fine.

777
00:38:09,402 --> 00:38:12,571
<i>So, um, when's -- when's
your wedding happening?</i>

778
00:38:12,572 --> 00:38:16,009
Uh, next week.

779
00:38:17,777 --> 00:38:20,312
I'd rather not talk about it.

780
00:38:20,313 --> 00:38:21,747
Why? Is something wrong?

781
00:38:21,748 --> 00:38:23,583
No.

782
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:29,155
What are you painting?

783
00:38:31,624 --> 00:38:33,759
I'm painting...

784
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,428
Really, there's just --
There's just so many layers

785
00:38:36,429 --> 00:38:38,363
of imaginistic symbolism in here

786
00:38:38,364 --> 00:38:41,633
that I wouldn't even feel
comfortable summing it all up.

787
00:38:41,634 --> 00:38:43,202
<i>All right.</i>

788
00:38:43,203 --> 00:38:45,137
It's this reoccurring
dream I have

789
00:38:45,138 --> 00:38:47,072
of a mermaid riding
a rocket ship.

790
00:38:47,073 --> 00:38:49,641
A rocket ship? How?

791
00:38:49,642 --> 00:38:52,211
Well, she's riding it
sidesaddle.

792
00:38:52,212 --> 00:38:54,413
She's a mermaid. She's got a
fish tail, for Christ's sake.

793
00:38:54,414 --> 00:38:56,349
Okay.

794
00:38:57,617 --> 00:38:59,651
The most important thing,
of course, though,

795
00:38:59,652 --> 00:39:00,000
um, is empathy.

796
00:39:00,001 --> 00:39:03,355
Um, is empathy.

797
00:39:03,356 --> 00:39:05,123
Just 'cause you want
the viewer to feel like

798
00:39:05,124 --> 00:39:08,493
the mermaid understands them,
you know?

799
00:39:08,494 --> 00:39:11,363
Do you have any idea
what you're talking about?

800
00:39:11,364 --> 00:39:13,365
Does it matter? <i>Well, I mean,</i>

801
00:39:13,366 --> 00:39:16,001
sometimes people say
what they really think.

802
00:39:16,002 --> 00:39:17,169
Okay, smarty.

803
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:19,037
Well, then, w-what if --
What if, uh,

804
00:39:19,038 --> 00:39:20,739
people don't know
what they really think?

805
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:22,642
Doesn't matter.

806
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:28,413
You just... Be yourself.

807
00:39:28,414 --> 00:39:29,999
Well, that sounds boring to me.

808
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,216
Well, that sounds boring to me.

809
00:39:31,217 --> 00:39:33,619
No. It's not boring.

810
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:38,123
It's scary and wonderful
and exciting.

811
00:39:38,124 --> 00:39:40,259
Really? What's so exciting
about being yourself?

812
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:42,094
<i>Hey. Hi.</i>

813
00:39:42,095 --> 00:39:44,030
There you are.

814
00:39:45,765 --> 00:39:47,433
<i>Hi.</i> Hi.

815
00:39:50,036 --> 00:39:52,004
Hey. Miner weber.

816
00:39:52,005 --> 00:39:53,538
Weber miner.

817
00:39:53,539 --> 00:39:55,407
Kelly.

818
00:39:55,408 --> 00:39:57,442
This is Kelly.

819
00:39:57,443 --> 00:39:59,611
Kelly ernswiler.
It's a pleasure.

820
00:39:59,612 --> 00:40:00,000
Uh, so, what have we got,

821
00:40:00,001 --> 00:40:01,480
uh, so, what have we got,

822
00:40:01,481 --> 00:40:03,115
a little painting class
going on here, huh?

823
00:40:03,116 --> 00:40:06,351
He's one of Bart's friends. He paints.
Yeah? That's great. Listen.

824
00:40:06,352 --> 00:40:08,320
<i>If we're gonna be on time for
dinner, we got to get going.</i>

825
00:40:08,321 --> 00:40:10,122
Okay. I'm gonna grab my coat.

826
00:40:10,123 --> 00:40:11,291
All right.

827
00:40:13,159 --> 00:40:15,294
So you paint, huh?

828
00:40:15,295 --> 00:40:17,162
Yeah. You know, just started.

829
00:40:17,163 --> 00:40:19,097
Right.

830
00:40:19,098 --> 00:40:21,066
<i>So, what do you do
in your spare time?</i>

831
00:40:21,067 --> 00:40:22,702
You a hobby man?

832
00:40:25,138 --> 00:40:27,339
You're still in high school?

833
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:29,207
Yeah, I am.

834
00:40:29,208 --> 00:40:29,999
But I also moonlight as a
stock boy over at the shop ease.

835
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,544
But I also moonlight as a
stock boy over at the shop ease.

836
00:40:32,545 --> 00:40:35,047
And president don kaminsky says
every employee is part owner.

837
00:40:35,048 --> 00:40:37,683
So I guess you could say
I'm a captain of industry

838
00:40:37,684 --> 00:40:39,017
<i>in training.</i>

839
00:40:39,018 --> 00:40:43,188
Sort of, um, a capitalist larva.

840
00:40:43,189 --> 00:40:46,158
Wow. That's quite an image.

841
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:47,693
Only if you see
the most magical part.

842
00:40:47,694 --> 00:40:49,027
Do you see it?

843
00:40:49,028 --> 00:40:50,996
No. What is it?

844
00:40:50,997 --> 00:40:54,566
One day, I'm gonna be
a beautiful butterfly, right?

845
00:40:54,567 --> 00:40:56,435
<i>But first, I have to be a pupa.</i>

846
00:40:56,436 --> 00:40:58,537
And pupas don't really
go out that much,

847
00:40:58,538 --> 00:40:59,999
so I don't think I'm gonna be
going out that much.

848
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,274
So I don't think I'm gonna be
going out that much.

849
00:41:02,275 --> 00:41:03,776
Pupa.

850
00:41:05,078 --> 00:41:08,347
The awkward adolescents
of the insect world.

851
00:41:08,348 --> 00:41:09,781
<i>All set.</i>

852
00:41:09,782 --> 00:41:13,285
Um, about time. Let's go.

853
00:41:13,286 --> 00:41:15,153
Oh, Kelly, if you want,
you can stay.

854
00:41:15,154 --> 00:41:17,123
No, thanks. I got to go to work.

855
00:41:45,485 --> 00:41:47,652
Know what this is right here?

856
00:41:47,653 --> 00:41:50,989
What? 18 volts of pure freedom.

857
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:54,026
Have you been in
the cough syrup aisle again?

858
00:41:54,027 --> 00:41:55,361
Perhaps.

859
00:41:57,430 --> 00:41:59,999
Hey, have you thought any more
about that concert?

860
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,960
Hey, have you thought any more
about that concert?

861
00:42:02,001 --> 00:42:04,436
Um, yeah, Sarah.

862
00:42:04,437 --> 00:42:07,305
I don't really think
that's a good idea.

863
00:42:07,306 --> 00:42:09,608
Why not?

864
00:42:09,609 --> 00:42:12,778
It's kind of a date, isn't it?

865
00:42:12,779 --> 00:42:14,379
Um...

866
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:16,481
I don't know.

867
00:42:16,482 --> 00:42:18,183
'Cause if it is,
I'm not gonna be able to go

868
00:42:18,184 --> 00:42:21,586
'cause I'm kind of seeing
somebody at the moment.

869
00:42:21,587 --> 00:42:23,088
You're seeing somebody?

870
00:42:23,089 --> 00:42:25,390
I'm not --
I'm not <i>seeing</i> her.

871
00:42:25,391 --> 00:42:29,294
But, uh, we're about to see...
I'm about to see her.

872
00:42:29,295 --> 00:42:29,999
Yeah. Well, who --
I mean...

873
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,396
Yeah. Well, who --
I mean...

874
00:42:31,397 --> 00:42:33,665
You know, if you don't mind
me asking, who is she?

875
00:42:33,666 --> 00:42:38,203
S-she's, uh...

876
00:42:38,204 --> 00:42:39,171
You don't know her.

877
00:42:39,172 --> 00:42:41,474
She's not, you know,
somebody you know.

878
00:42:42,408 --> 00:42:45,144
Is she a mail-order bride
or something?

879
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:10,168
Okay. That's good, Jeffrey.

880
00:43:10,169 --> 00:43:11,637
Hey, numbnuts.

881
00:43:13,172 --> 00:43:14,306
Trying to do a project here.

882
00:43:14,307 --> 00:43:16,109
Why don't you pull
a little weight?

883
00:43:17,343 --> 00:43:20,479
Oh, I think you can color inside
the lines by yourself, don't you?

884
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,646
You know, I think so.

885
00:43:21,647 --> 00:43:23,515
But actually,
I forgot my nontoxic crayons.

886
00:43:23,516 --> 00:43:27,286
So why don't you do it for me,
diaper baby?

887
00:43:41,667 --> 00:43:44,336
<i>My dad has this friend
who's a director.</i>

888
00:43:44,337 --> 00:43:46,638
<i>He's shooting a documentary
for the history channel.</i>

889
00:43:46,639 --> 00:43:48,173
That's cool.

890
00:43:48,174 --> 00:43:50,575
He needs some guys
to reenact a battle

891
00:43:50,576 --> 00:43:52,477
from the allied offensive
for him.

892
00:43:52,478 --> 00:43:55,747
We're gonna be
on the history channel?

893
00:43:55,748 --> 00:43:57,215
I haven't asked you yet.

894
00:43:57,216 --> 00:43:59,117
Well, ask me, then.

895
00:43:59,118 --> 00:43:59,999
Stop. Seriously. Put it away.
Come on. Ask me.

896
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,219
Stop. Seriously. Put it away.
Come on. Ask me.

897
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:03,054
Ask me.

898
00:44:03,055 --> 00:44:05,257
Well, if you want to, next week.

899
00:44:05,258 --> 00:44:07,526
But you have to
take it seriously.

900
00:44:07,527 --> 00:44:10,195
Of course I will.
I always take it seriously.

901
00:44:10,196 --> 00:44:11,496
From what I've seen,

902
00:44:11,497 --> 00:44:15,467
you play fast and loose
with your characterizations.

903
00:44:15,468 --> 00:44:17,469
I'm fast and loose?

904
00:44:17,470 --> 00:44:19,371
You're fast and loose.

905
00:44:19,372 --> 00:44:22,040
I play the emotional truth.
I make it real.

906
00:44:22,041 --> 00:44:23,543
Like back in the dining room?

907
00:44:25,211 --> 00:44:27,079
What was that?

908
00:44:28,648 --> 00:44:29,999
"I've noticed your magnolias.
Very fine specimens."

909
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,218
"I've noticed your magnolias.
Very fine specimens."

910
00:44:33,219 --> 00:44:35,353
That was real?

911
00:44:35,354 --> 00:44:37,756
What the hell does that
have to do with anything?

912
00:44:37,757 --> 00:44:40,559
You seem to have
your own agenda, that's all.

913
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,594
Well, Bart,
I do have my own agenda.

914
00:44:42,595 --> 00:44:44,462
What other reason is there
to do anything?

915
00:44:44,463 --> 00:44:46,231
I'm just saying,

916
00:44:46,232 --> 00:44:48,700
I know the difference
between fantasy and reality.

917
00:44:48,701 --> 00:44:50,235
Oh, okay.

918
00:44:50,236 --> 00:44:53,238
So you're saying that
I-i don't know the difference?

919
00:44:53,239 --> 00:44:55,373
I don't --
I don't know.

920
00:44:55,374 --> 00:44:57,175
You don't know what, Bart?

921
00:44:57,176 --> 00:44:59,145
You don't know
if you just said that to me?

922
00:45:02,582 --> 00:45:04,616
<i>It's just...</i>

923
00:45:04,617 --> 00:45:07,152
It's just nervous energy
before a big mission.

924
00:45:07,153 --> 00:45:09,354
It's natural.

925
00:45:09,355 --> 00:45:10,989
Right.

926
00:45:10,990 --> 00:45:12,991
Nerves.

927
00:45:12,992 --> 00:45:14,993
See you at 0400.

928
00:45:14,994 --> 00:45:17,163
I'll be there at 0400.

929
00:45:19,031 --> 00:45:20,699
<i>And if I don't sell them there,</i>

930
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:23,001
<i>I'll set up on the corner
of Stevenson Lane.</i>

931
00:45:23,002 --> 00:45:25,037
That's a good location.

932
00:45:26,172 --> 00:45:28,707
Are you listening to me?

933
00:45:28,708 --> 00:45:29,999
Did you put more red pepper
in this than usual?

934
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,543
Did you put more red pepper
in this than usual?

935
00:45:31,544 --> 00:45:35,146
No. It's the same as always.

936
00:45:35,147 --> 00:45:38,083
<i>Honey, you should eat.</i>

937
00:45:38,084 --> 00:45:39,518
I'm not hungry.

938
00:45:41,721 --> 00:45:43,421
Kelly, want some dinner?

939
00:45:43,422 --> 00:45:45,157
I ate.

940
00:45:50,062 --> 00:45:52,198
One day, we'll all be happy.

941
00:45:53,499 --> 00:45:55,735
I won't know what to do
with myself.

942
00:46:07,179 --> 00:46:09,514
<i>This is shaker heights.</i>

943
00:46:09,515 --> 00:46:11,716
<i>We're under attack.
I repeat, under attack.</i>

944
00:46:11,717 --> 00:46:13,618
<i>This is not a test or a drill.</i>

945
00:46:13,619 --> 00:46:15,553
<i>This is an actual emergency.</i>

946
00:46:15,554 --> 00:46:17,289
<i>Enemy troops are fanning out,</i>

947
00:46:17,290 --> 00:46:20,058
<i>and we're not quite sure where
they're coming from just yet.</i>

948
00:46:20,059 --> 00:46:23,061
<i>In fact, very little is known about
our invaders at the present time.</i>

949
00:46:23,062 --> 00:46:25,730
<i>What little we know is that
they're ruthless, organized,</i>

950
00:46:25,731 --> 00:46:28,133
<i>and we strongly urge you
to stay inside your homes</i>

951
00:46:28,134 --> 00:46:29,668
<i>and do not try
to defend yourselves!</i>

952
00:46:29,669 --> 00:46:30,000
<i>These people are
easily pissed off</i>

953
00:46:30,001 --> 00:46:31,169
<i>these people are
easily pissed off</i>

954
00:46:31,170 --> 00:46:33,138
<i>and extremely dangerous!
 That's correct, bill.</i>

955
00:46:33,139 --> 00:46:36,074
<i>We've just received word that the local
police force has been overthrown.</i>

956
00:46:36,075 --> 00:46:38,143
<i>Just the sheer size
of this invasion is staggering.</i>

957
00:46:38,144 --> 00:46:39,678
<i>Also, we've been told
by a reliable source</i>

958
00:46:39,679 --> 00:46:41,781
<i>that any aggressive action
toward the attackers...</i>

959
00:46:44,350 --> 00:46:47,552
<i>They're everywhere! People,
please, don't risk any action.</i>

960
00:46:47,553 --> 00:46:51,056
<i>There's really little that anyone
can do to stop these people.</i>

961
00:46:51,057 --> 00:46:54,192
<i>Get under a table.
Cover your head.</i>

962
00:46:54,193 --> 00:46:56,062
Aah!

963
00:46:58,464 --> 00:46:59,999
<i>They're in the building!</i>

964
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:00,960
<i>They're in the building!</i>

965
00:47:02,535 --> 00:47:04,402
Get him!

966
00:47:04,403 --> 00:47:05,670
Aah!

967
00:47:05,671 --> 00:47:07,739
Bring him down here.
Come on. Drag him outside.

968
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:09,140
Let go of me! Let go!

969
00:47:09,141 --> 00:47:11,242
Come on!

970
00:47:11,243 --> 00:47:13,078
<i>Please! Put him down!</i>

971
00:47:13,079 --> 00:47:14,513
Right there!

972
00:47:16,082 --> 00:47:18,216
Where are the purple kiffnits?

973
00:47:18,217 --> 00:47:19,284
What?

974
00:47:19,285 --> 00:47:20,752
Give us the Merlins!

975
00:47:20,753 --> 00:47:23,221
What?! <i>Cooperate
or die like dog!</i>

976
00:47:23,222 --> 00:47:24,589
Please don't hurt me!

977
00:47:24,590 --> 00:47:27,359
<i>Please don't hurt me.</i>
You know too much already.

978
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:29,627
Look, please! I'm not --
I'm not gonna tell anybody.

979
00:47:29,628 --> 00:47:30,000
Your whimpering sickens us.
You die now!

980
00:47:30,001 --> 00:47:31,496
Your whimpering sickens us.
You die now!

981
00:47:31,497 --> 00:47:32,564
Please don't do it!

982
00:47:32,565 --> 00:47:34,700
Enough!

983
00:47:43,008 --> 00:47:44,609
Oh, damn.

984
00:47:44,610 --> 00:47:46,411
Mission accomplished, I'd say.

985
00:47:46,412 --> 00:47:48,680
Yeah. Can't ask for
more than that.

986
00:47:48,681 --> 00:47:50,616
Move out! Go! Go! Go!

987
00:48:05,097 --> 00:48:06,664
We have to talk.

988
00:48:06,665 --> 00:48:08,466
Not now. I got to go to school.

989
00:48:08,467 --> 00:48:11,302
Your father's in the hospital.

990
00:48:11,303 --> 00:48:12,337
Again?

991
00:48:12,338 --> 00:48:14,205
Unbelievable.
Which junkie is it now?

992
00:48:14,206 --> 00:48:16,142
It's him.

993
00:48:36,529 --> 00:48:41,466
<i>They called the western front
the "sausage factory."</i>

994
00:48:41,467 --> 00:48:43,501
And not in --
In a positive sense.

995
00:48:43,502 --> 00:48:45,303
<i>Sure, we all like hot dogs.</i>

996
00:48:45,304 --> 00:48:50,542
<i>But this had a decidedly
negative connotation.</i>

997
00:48:50,543 --> 00:48:53,678
Anything to add, Mr. ernswiler?

998
00:48:53,679 --> 00:48:56,314
Uh, no, sir.

999
00:48:56,315 --> 00:48:57,982
Good.

1000
00:48:57,983 --> 00:48:59,999
<i>Now, uh, on to the --
The offensive weaponry.</i>

1001
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:00,186
<i>Now, uh, on to the --
The offensive weaponry.</i>

1002
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:03,289
Um, mustard gas.

1003
00:49:08,127 --> 00:49:10,595
<i>So, filming on Saturday.</i>

1004
00:49:10,596 --> 00:49:12,298
Are you excited?

1005
00:49:13,999 --> 00:49:16,134
He's got an explosive
expert coming.

1006
00:49:16,135 --> 00:49:17,769
It's gonna be awesome.

1007
00:49:17,770 --> 00:49:20,104
They want you to come dressed
like wonder woman.

1008
00:49:20,105 --> 00:49:21,740
<i>That cool?</i>

1009
00:49:22,741 --> 00:49:24,743
What's the matter with you?

1010
00:49:26,145 --> 00:49:29,047
Well, he hasn't been
at school in two days.

1011
00:49:29,048 --> 00:49:29,999
You know, I'm starting to worry
a little bit.

1012
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:30,982
You know, I'm starting to worry
a little bit.

1013
00:49:30,983 --> 00:49:33,451
I'm sure he's fine.

1014
00:49:33,452 --> 00:49:35,053
Are you sure he's fine?

1015
00:49:35,054 --> 00:49:37,056
<i>How are you so sure?</i>

1016
00:49:45,464 --> 00:49:46,599
Who are you calling?

1017
00:49:50,069 --> 00:49:51,436
<i>Hello?</i>

1018
00:49:51,437 --> 00:49:53,037
Lance, please.

1019
00:49:53,038 --> 00:49:54,272
<i>Just a minute.</i>

1020
00:49:54,273 --> 00:49:56,474
Give me the phone. <i>Lance, honey!</i>

1021
00:49:56,475 --> 00:49:57,542
<i>Phone!</i>

1022
00:49:57,543 --> 00:49:58,743
Give me the phone.

1023
00:49:58,744 --> 00:49:59,999
<i>I got it, dad.</i>

1024
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:00,612
<i>I got it, dad.</i>

1025
00:50:00,613 --> 00:50:03,015
See that? He's fine.

1026
00:50:04,617 --> 00:50:06,551
Maybe you should think about
something else,

1027
00:50:06,552 --> 00:50:11,389
like... What are you gonna do
after graduation?

1028
00:50:11,390 --> 00:50:13,458
Well, nice segue.

1029
00:50:13,459 --> 00:50:14,759
<i>You sound like your dad.</i>

1030
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:16,227
All right. You can joke.

1031
00:50:16,228 --> 00:50:19,531
But he was talking about
helping you out.

1032
00:50:19,532 --> 00:50:21,766
You want to go to dartmouth?

1033
00:50:21,767 --> 00:50:23,234
Are you serious?

1034
00:50:23,235 --> 00:50:24,435
He was.

1035
00:50:24,436 --> 00:50:26,437
<i>He could pull some strings.</i>

1036
00:50:26,438 --> 00:50:28,573
I don't know, man.

1037
00:50:28,574 --> 00:50:29,999
I don't know if that'll work
for me, you know?

1038
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,210
I don't know if that'll work
for me, you know?

1039
00:50:32,211 --> 00:50:34,279
I'm not socially ready for that.
You know what I mean?

1040
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:35,780
<i>Well, tell that to my family.</i>

1041
00:50:35,781 --> 00:50:37,482
They're like
your little fan club.

1042
00:50:37,483 --> 00:50:39,017
<i>Even tabby likes you.</i>

1043
00:50:39,018 --> 00:50:40,985
She say that to you?

1044
00:50:40,986 --> 00:50:43,054
You read it in her diary
or something?

1045
00:50:43,055 --> 00:50:45,424
Well, she invited you
to the wedding.

1046
00:50:46,358 --> 00:50:49,027
<i>But you probably
wouldn't want to do that.</i>

1047
00:50:49,028 --> 00:50:50,228
<i>So I'll --</i>
What -- weddings?

1048
00:50:50,229 --> 00:50:52,030
Bro, I love weddings.

1049
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:55,033
Me and weddings.
Right here. Like this.

1050
00:50:55,034 --> 00:50:56,701
In fact, every time
I'm at weddings,

1051
00:50:56,702 --> 00:50:59,637
<i>I usually get wasted and --
And dry-hump someone's aunt.</i>

1052
00:50:59,638 --> 00:51:00,000
Well, good.

1053
00:51:00,001 --> 00:51:01,072
Well, good.

1054
00:51:01,073 --> 00:51:03,274
I'll, uh, call
my mom's aunt Maureen

1055
00:51:03,275 --> 00:51:05,677
and, uh, tell her to expect
a little action.

1056
00:51:05,678 --> 00:51:09,113
Maureen, huh? Pretty name.

1057
00:51:09,114 --> 00:51:12,317
Yeah. Little advice, though.
Don't look right at the goiter.

1058
00:51:12,318 --> 00:51:14,019
It's...

1059
00:51:35,307 --> 00:51:36,742
Tabby?

1060
00:51:40,179 --> 00:51:43,048
So, you invited me
to your wedding?

1061
00:51:43,616 --> 00:51:45,683
There isn't gonna be a wedding.

1062
00:51:45,684 --> 00:51:48,487
W-why? W-what happened?

1063
00:51:49,588 --> 00:51:53,759
Miner kissed this woman
he works with.

1064
00:52:00,232 --> 00:52:01,299
Honestly, I didn't think

1065
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:03,735
you guys were right
for each other, anyway.

1066
00:52:03,736 --> 00:52:06,572
You didn't, huh?

1067
00:52:10,142 --> 00:52:13,077
Like -- like this painting,
for instance.

1068
00:52:13,078 --> 00:52:15,179
You see this painting?

1069
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:17,048
If you were to stare at this
for too long,

1070
00:52:17,049 --> 00:52:18,383
<i>you wouldn't know what it was.</i>

1071
00:52:18,384 --> 00:52:20,652
<i>But for somebody who just
comes in and sees it,</i>

1072
00:52:20,653 --> 00:52:22,687
they know exactly what it is,
you know what I mean?

1073
00:52:22,688 --> 00:52:25,591
I don't need any bullshit
right now.

1074
00:52:28,327 --> 00:52:29,999
He couldn't understand you,
tabby.

1075
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:30,628
He couldn't understand you,
tabby.

1076
00:52:30,629 --> 00:52:33,297
I'm not as complicated
as you think.

1077
00:52:33,298 --> 00:52:37,269
I...I didn't say
you were complicated.

1078
00:52:41,407 --> 00:52:43,475
I'm really sorry, tabby.

1079
00:52:45,778 --> 00:52:47,479
<i>Come on. Don't cry.</i>

1080
00:52:49,014 --> 00:52:51,416
No. Don't cry.

1081
00:52:51,417 --> 00:52:53,285
Please.

1082
00:52:56,188 --> 00:52:58,090
There you go.

1083
00:53:07,433 --> 00:53:09,668
You like me, don't you?

1084
00:53:11,437 --> 00:53:13,571
Of course.

1085
00:53:13,572 --> 00:53:15,641
No. I mean...

1086
00:53:17,443 --> 00:53:19,645
You like me.

1087
00:53:31,190 --> 00:53:33,292
I think you're amazing.

1088
00:54:28,347 --> 00:54:29,999
<i>Bart!
What are you doing out there?</i>

1089
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,360
<i>Bart!
What are you doing out there?</i>

1090
00:54:58,343 --> 00:54:59,999
<i>Mom?</i>

1091
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:00,500
<i>Mom?</i>

1092
00:55:18,130 --> 00:55:20,198
<i>Uh, vehicles are
supposed to show up.</i>

1093
00:55:20,199 --> 00:55:22,334
<i>Let me know what shows up.</i>

1094
00:55:26,505 --> 00:55:28,206
You look perfect.

1095
00:55:28,207 --> 00:55:29,440
You think so?

1096
00:55:29,441 --> 00:55:29,999
Yeah, it's been seasoning
under my bed for a little bit.

1097
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,742
Yeah, it's been seasoning
under my bed for a little bit.

1098
00:55:31,743 --> 00:55:34,212
Put a little work into it.

1099
00:55:34,213 --> 00:55:37,682
Uh, some of the other boys are
over at craft services.

1100
00:55:37,683 --> 00:55:39,284
Okay.

1101
00:55:40,686 --> 00:55:42,688
The snack table.

1102
00:55:44,122 --> 00:55:46,023
Oh, craft services is
the snack table. Okay.

1103
00:55:46,024 --> 00:55:47,625
Um, uh, let me show --

1104
00:55:47,626 --> 00:55:50,061
Know what kind of vehicles
show up before lunch because --

1105
00:55:50,062 --> 00:55:51,329
Is Bart bowland here?

1106
00:55:51,330 --> 00:55:53,464
I have no idea. Excuse me.

1107
00:55:53,465 --> 00:55:56,235
So, I want a medium shot
coming down from here with...

1108
00:56:05,410 --> 00:56:07,478
All right, everybody.
We're gonna start positioning.

1109
00:56:07,479 --> 00:56:10,248
Uh, you, you, and you,
I want you over by that tree.

1110
00:56:10,249 --> 00:56:12,483
You and all of you guys,
you're up behind the hill.

1111
00:56:12,484 --> 00:56:14,285
All right. Whose Jeep is that?

1112
00:56:14,286 --> 00:56:15,753
That mg? <i>Yeah.</i>

1113
00:56:15,754 --> 00:56:17,221
She's mine.

1114
00:56:17,222 --> 00:56:18,356
Great.
We're gonna need to use it.

1115
00:56:18,357 --> 00:56:20,591
Can you take it up behind
the hill over there?

1116
00:56:20,592 --> 00:56:22,126
Sure.

1117
00:56:22,127 --> 00:56:24,161
Um, did Bart bowland
check in yet?

1118
00:56:24,162 --> 00:56:26,564
<i>I don't know. It doesn't matter.
We've got enough people.</i>

1119
00:56:26,565 --> 00:56:29,734
Well, he's gonna -- <i>all right.
Places, please!</i>

1120
00:56:29,735 --> 00:56:30,000
Let's go!

1121
00:56:30,001 --> 00:56:31,670
Let's go!

1122
00:56:42,781 --> 00:56:45,650
Password!

1123
00:56:45,651 --> 00:56:47,653
Where the hell you been?

1124
00:56:49,121 --> 00:56:50,354
Nowhere.

1125
00:56:50,355 --> 00:56:51,689
<i>It really wasn't smart
of you, man.</i>

1126
00:56:51,690 --> 00:56:53,224
I mean, they got me
driving old lippy.

1127
00:56:53,225 --> 00:56:55,259
And I'm gonna get
a crapload of close-ups.

1128
00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:57,261
And what are you wearing?

1129
00:56:57,262 --> 00:56:59,397
Where's your kit at?

1130
00:56:59,398 --> 00:56:59,999
I ought to kill you right now.

1131
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,366
I ought to kill you right now.

1132
00:57:02,567 --> 00:57:03,701
What?

1133
00:57:03,702 --> 00:57:06,170
You had to do it.

1134
00:57:06,171 --> 00:57:08,439
What are you --
Do what?

1135
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:11,442
You just... Do
whatever the hell you want.

1136
00:57:11,443 --> 00:57:14,313
And consequences,
they don't matter, do they?

1137
00:57:15,414 --> 00:57:17,381
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1138
00:57:17,382 --> 00:57:19,417
I'm talking about
your agenda again, Kelly,

1139
00:57:19,418 --> 00:57:22,320
which apparently includes
hitting on my sister!

1140
00:57:22,321 --> 00:57:24,689
<i>Okay. Picture is up.</i>

1141
00:57:24,690 --> 00:57:26,557
<i>Roll camera.</i> mark.

1142
00:57:26,558 --> 00:57:28,326
What did you think
she was gonna do?

1143
00:57:28,327 --> 00:57:29,660
Run off with you?

1144
00:57:29,661 --> 00:57:30,000
<i>You're a 17-year-old bag boy.</i>

1145
00:57:30,001 --> 00:57:32,163
<i>You're a 17-year-old bag boy.</i>

1146
00:57:32,164 --> 00:57:34,432
She is a Yale grad student.

1147
00:57:34,433 --> 00:57:36,734
Talk about living in
a fucking fantasy world!

1148
00:57:36,735 --> 00:57:38,370
Action!

1149
00:57:39,404 --> 00:57:41,138
Cue the Jeep!

1150
00:57:41,139 --> 00:57:42,606
Bart, what do you want me to do?

1151
00:57:42,607 --> 00:57:44,742
You want me to be miserable
like you are? I can do that.

1152
00:57:44,743 --> 00:57:47,211
Will it make it any better?

1153
00:57:47,212 --> 00:57:49,113
You got it all figured out,
don't you?

1154
00:57:49,114 --> 00:57:50,681
<i>Cue the Jeep!</i>
Better than you do...

1155
00:57:50,682 --> 00:57:52,718
Daddy's boy.

1156
00:57:54,486 --> 00:57:56,488
Aah! Hey! Hey!

1157
00:57:57,689 --> 00:57:59,358
Cue the Jeep!

1158
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:03,395
Hey! Get out of the way!

1159
00:58:24,750 --> 00:58:26,450
<i>It's cool. We can use it.
We can just --</i>

1160
00:58:26,451 --> 00:58:28,686
We'll -- we'll edit it together
with some newsreel footage.

1161
00:58:28,687 --> 00:58:29,999
It -- it'll be fine.

1162
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:30,800
It -- it'll be fine.

1163
00:58:31,423 --> 00:58:32,657
What?

1164
00:59:16,535 --> 00:59:18,736
Where have you been?

1165
00:59:18,737 --> 00:59:20,004
Listen, ma.

1166
00:59:20,005 --> 00:59:23,040
Can we talk about this tomorrow?

1167
00:59:23,041 --> 00:59:27,211
Your father's gone downhill.
They have him on dialysis.

1168
00:59:27,212 --> 00:59:29,213
Well, that's perfect.

1169
00:59:29,214 --> 00:59:29,999
Why would you say
something like that?

1170
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,982
Why would you say
something like that?

1171
00:59:31,983 --> 00:59:35,386
I don't know.
It just seems to fit.

1172
00:59:35,387 --> 00:59:38,456
Seems to fit?

1173
00:59:38,457 --> 00:59:40,424
Do you understand
what I just said?

1174
00:59:40,425 --> 00:59:43,360
No, ma.
Why don't you say it again?

1175
00:59:43,361 --> 00:59:46,530
When are you going to
forgive him?

1176
00:59:46,531 --> 00:59:49,101
When am I gonna forgive him?

1177
00:59:50,001 --> 00:59:52,369
<i>That's quite a question, ma.</i>

1178
00:59:52,370 --> 00:59:56,073
When am I gonna forgive him?
Hmm.

1179
00:59:56,074 --> 00:59:57,241
I-I don't know.

1180
00:59:57,242 --> 00:59:58,609
Maybe -- maybe when I forget
all the lyrics

1181
00:59:58,610 --> 00:59:59,999
to "the little mermaid"
soundtrack that he'd play

1182
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:00,511
to "the little mermaid"
soundtrack that he'd play

1183
01:00:00,512 --> 01:00:03,180
every time he'd take me
so he could go score.

1184
01:00:03,181 --> 01:00:06,550
<i>Maybe when we don't live in
a house that's always for sale.</i>

1185
01:00:06,551 --> 01:00:08,052
I don't know. I don't --

1186
01:00:08,053 --> 01:00:10,354
You know, I'll forgive him
when I go to college.

1187
01:00:10,355 --> 01:00:12,323
That's when I'll forgive him.

1188
01:00:12,324 --> 01:00:15,092
<i>I can't go, can I?</i>

1189
01:00:15,093 --> 01:00:17,161
'Cause he took all the money
out of my college fund

1190
01:00:17,162 --> 01:00:18,996
and bought Mexican black tar
with it.

1191
01:00:18,997 --> 01:00:20,731
And you're asking me
to forgive this guy.

1192
01:00:20,732 --> 01:00:22,500
No way.

1193
01:00:22,501 --> 01:00:25,736
All right.
Come with me to the hospital.

1194
01:00:25,737 --> 01:00:27,571
Okay.

1195
01:00:27,572 --> 01:00:29,999
This isn't about you anymore.

1196
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:30,075
This isn't about you anymore.

1197
01:00:30,076 --> 01:00:31,175
It's never about me.

1198
01:00:31,176 --> 01:00:33,477
What is wrong with you?

1199
01:00:33,478 --> 01:00:36,480
<i>I'm so sick of you being angry.</i>

1200
01:00:36,481 --> 01:00:38,349
<i>I want to be angry.</i> Mom, enough.

1201
01:00:38,350 --> 01:00:42,486
You will not tell me
what is enough.

1202
01:00:42,487 --> 01:00:46,023
You don't know about anything.
You...

1203
01:00:46,024 --> 01:00:50,595
I'm talking about the man
I love.

1204
01:01:08,547 --> 01:01:11,148
Hey, Kelly.

1205
01:01:11,149 --> 01:01:12,283
Hey, look. I just --

1206
01:01:12,284 --> 01:01:15,253
I thought you should know
that I gave my notice, okay?

1207
01:01:16,688 --> 01:01:18,223
<i>Kelly?</i>

1208
01:01:26,031 --> 01:01:27,298
<i>Kelly?</i>

1209
01:01:27,299 --> 01:01:29,166
Oh, hi, Mrs. bowland.

1210
01:01:29,167 --> 01:01:29,999
Bart's not here, honey.

1211
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:30,501
Bart's not here, honey.

1212
01:01:30,502 --> 01:01:33,437
Actually, I was, uh,
going to see tabby.

1213
01:01:33,438 --> 01:01:34,638
Oh.

1214
01:01:34,639 --> 01:01:37,341
Uh, well, tabby's
at her final fitting.

1215
01:01:37,342 --> 01:01:39,644
Wedding's tomorrow.

1216
01:02:02,434 --> 01:02:04,569
Damn it!

1217
01:02:11,743 --> 01:02:13,612
God damn.

1218
01:02:29,127 --> 01:02:29,999
Oh...

1219
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:30,500
Oh...

1220
01:02:45,043 --> 01:02:46,310
<i>Is everyone in their places?</i>

1221
01:02:46,311 --> 01:02:47,778
Yes.

1222
01:02:47,779 --> 01:02:49,179
And the organist?

1223
01:02:49,180 --> 01:02:50,448
Ready.

1224
01:02:52,117 --> 01:02:54,418
Where are the cars?

1225
01:02:54,419 --> 01:02:56,287
They'll be here
in a few minutes.

1226
01:02:56,288 --> 01:02:57,289
Calm down.

1227
01:03:06,197 --> 01:03:08,032
What the hell are you doing?

1228
01:03:08,033 --> 01:03:09,166
What do you mean? I was invited.

1229
01:03:09,167 --> 01:03:11,001
I uninvited you.

1230
01:03:11,002 --> 01:03:13,705
You unin--
It's not your wedding, Bart.

1231
01:03:17,342 --> 01:03:19,110
Why are you wearing that?

1232
01:03:21,713 --> 01:03:24,716
Look. I can't let you come in.

1233
01:03:25,717 --> 01:03:27,318
Why not?

1234
01:03:27,319 --> 01:03:28,686
Because you know why.

1235
01:03:28,687 --> 01:03:29,999
Just go home.

1236
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:30,622
Just go home.

1237
01:03:32,190 --> 01:03:33,358
Bart...

1238
01:03:48,506 --> 01:03:49,473
Kelly!

1239
01:03:49,474 --> 01:03:52,142
What are you doing?

1240
01:03:52,143 --> 01:03:54,478
Just listen.

1241
01:03:54,479 --> 01:03:55,679
This is my wedding day.

1242
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:58,716
I know what day it is.
I know what day it is.

1243
01:03:58,717 --> 01:03:59,999
Where do I fit in
in all of this? Huh?

1244
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,485
Where do I fit in
in all of this? Huh?

1245
01:04:01,486 --> 01:04:03,987
<i>I mean, I-i thought
we really had something.</i>

1246
01:04:03,988 --> 01:04:05,622
You know it wasn't like that.

1247
01:04:05,623 --> 01:04:08,158
No, I don't know
it wasn't like that.

1248
01:04:08,159 --> 01:04:10,361
<i>What was it?</i>

1249
01:04:10,362 --> 01:04:12,496
It was a moment.

1250
01:04:12,497 --> 01:04:15,999
A moment? What the hell is that?

1251
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,402
What do you want to do?
Do you want to stop the wedding?

1252
01:04:18,403 --> 01:04:21,739
No. I don't --
I...

1253
01:04:21,740 --> 01:04:22,639
Oh, come on.

1254
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:26,110
You... You shouldn't marry
this guy.

1255
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:27,044
Why?

1256
01:04:27,045 --> 01:04:29,580
You're an artist.
Do you know what I mean?

1257
01:04:29,581 --> 01:04:30,000
You're an artist, and he --

1258
01:04:30,001 --> 01:04:31,081
You're an artist, and he --

1259
01:04:31,082 --> 01:04:33,250
He's not into --
You know what I mean?

1260
01:04:33,251 --> 01:04:34,551
He's, um...

1261
01:04:34,552 --> 01:04:36,520
What is he? What does he do?

1262
01:04:36,521 --> 01:04:38,088
I still don't know.

1263
01:04:38,089 --> 01:04:42,026
<i>He's like a corporate,
money-making money manager.</i>

1264
01:04:42,994 --> 01:04:44,461
It just doesn't add up.

1265
01:04:44,462 --> 01:04:46,130
But that's the thing.

1266
01:04:46,131 --> 01:04:48,065
It -- it doesn't always add up.

1267
01:04:48,066 --> 01:04:50,067
<i>Tabby, honey,
are you coming out?</i>

1268
01:04:50,068 --> 01:04:54,071
<i>Kissing you made me feel
something I needed to.</i>

1269
01:04:54,072 --> 01:04:56,473
<i>That's all it was.</i>

1270
01:04:56,474 --> 01:04:57,741
I'm getting married right now.

1271
01:04:57,742 --> 01:04:59,999
And I would like you
to be happy for me.

1272
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,560
And I would like you
to be happy for me.

1273
01:05:03,281 --> 01:05:04,682
Okay?

1274
01:05:08,453 --> 01:05:10,522
<i>Here she is!</i>

1275
01:05:41,152 --> 01:05:43,020
<i>Kelly.</i>

1276
01:05:43,021 --> 01:05:44,555
Hey.

1277
01:05:44,556 --> 01:05:48,692
<i>We're just about to start.
What, are you taking off?</i>

1278
01:05:48,693 --> 01:05:51,295
Yeah.

1279
01:05:51,296 --> 01:05:53,664
What are you wearing?

1280
01:05:53,665 --> 01:05:56,066
I grew out of my old suit.

1281
01:05:56,067 --> 01:05:57,167
<i>Oh, yeah? Me too.</i>

1282
01:05:57,168 --> 01:05:59,999
Check it out. Rental.

1283
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:00,171
Check it out. Rental.

1284
01:06:00,172 --> 01:06:01,705
It's funny, you know?
A day like this in a guy's life,

1285
01:06:01,706 --> 01:06:03,740
he doesn't even wear
his own clothes.

1286
01:06:03,741 --> 01:06:05,209
Yeah.

1287
01:06:05,210 --> 01:06:08,612
It's just another thing that
doesn't feel real, you know?

1288
01:06:08,613 --> 01:06:12,282
<i>Especially after everything
tabby and I have been through.</i>

1289
01:06:12,283 --> 01:06:13,651
No.

1290
01:06:15,153 --> 01:06:17,721
It shouldn't feel that way,
you know?

1291
01:06:17,722 --> 01:06:20,124
Today's the most important day
of your life.

1292
01:06:25,063 --> 01:06:26,397
No.

1293
01:06:27,332 --> 01:06:29,999
No, man.
This is just the beginning.

1294
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:30,601
No, man.
This is just the beginning.

1295
01:06:30,602 --> 01:06:32,302
<i>I mean, everybody screws up.</i>

1296
01:06:32,303 --> 01:06:35,573
<i>But it's what you do afterwards
that counts, you know?</i>

1297
01:06:38,610 --> 01:06:40,377
Got to go.

1298
01:06:40,378 --> 01:06:42,347
See you.

1299
01:07:56,387 --> 01:07:58,555
You're looking good.

1300
01:07:58,556 --> 01:07:59,999
Keller.

1301
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,060
Keller.

1302
01:08:04,696 --> 01:08:06,129
Out of bed, huh?

1303
01:08:06,130 --> 01:08:07,097
Yeah.

1304
01:08:07,098 --> 01:08:08,131
Feeling better?

1305
01:08:08,132 --> 01:08:10,468
Yeah. Better.

1306
01:08:14,372 --> 01:08:15,740
They don't give you shoes?

1307
01:08:17,141 --> 01:08:19,777
No, no. They're over there.

1308
01:08:21,479 --> 01:08:25,216
You, uh, you want to watch
some TV?

1309
01:08:26,551 --> 01:08:28,685
<i>Look at that.
They bolted it to the wall.</i>

1310
01:08:28,686 --> 01:08:29,999
My reputation precedes me.

1311
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,423
My reputation precedes me.

1312
01:08:34,692 --> 01:08:36,494
Come on.

1313
01:09:02,153 --> 01:09:06,323
So, any, uh,
any battles this weekend?

1314
01:09:06,324 --> 01:09:08,593
A few.

1315
01:09:20,471 --> 01:09:22,206
He looks good.

1316
01:09:37,221 --> 01:09:39,357
So, you're new here, huh?

1317
01:09:43,695 --> 01:09:46,030
You got any hobbies?

1318
01:09:51,235 --> 01:09:53,771
Well, that's good.

1319
01:10:02,146 --> 01:10:05,249
Thanks for your help. Really.

1320
01:10:07,618 --> 01:10:10,053
<i>I'm not gonna tell anybody! Your
whimpering sickens us! You die now!</i>

1321
01:10:10,054 --> 01:10:12,223
Please don't do it! <i>Enough!</i>

1322
01:10:19,997 --> 01:10:21,431
<i>If you'd like to leave a message</i>

1323
01:10:21,432 --> 01:10:25,102
<i>for the bowlands, or Ruby,
please do so after the beep.</i>

1324
01:10:25,103 --> 01:10:26,737
<i>Uh, hey, bowlands.</i>

1325
01:10:26,738 --> 01:10:29,999
<i>Um... It's Kelly.</i>

1326
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:30,141
<i>Um... It's Kelly</i>

1327
01:10:30,142 --> 01:10:34,544
<i>just calling to say
that, um, I'm really sorry</i>

1328
01:10:34,545 --> 01:10:36,613
<i>that I made a mess
out of the festivities</i>

1329
01:10:36,614 --> 01:10:38,315
<i>that happened last week.</i>

1330
01:10:38,316 --> 01:10:40,650
<i>And, um...</i>

1331
01:10:40,651 --> 01:10:43,720
<i>And, Bart, uh, you know, I'm
heading down to the rat's nest</i>

1332
01:10:43,721 --> 01:10:46,423
<i>to sell off some of my stuff, so any --
any chance you want to catch me there,</i>

1333
01:10:46,424 --> 01:10:49,293
<i>uh, that's where
I can be caught.</i>

1334
01:10:57,335 --> 01:10:59,436
You're gonna make a killing.

1335
01:10:59,437 --> 01:10:59,999
Yeah.

1336
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,105
Yeah.

1337
01:11:06,110 --> 01:11:09,012
<i>♪ Will we both be happy ♪</i>

1338
01:11:09,013 --> 01:11:11,982
<i>♪ to stand alone? ♪</i>

1339
01:11:11,983 --> 01:11:13,216
Here.

1340
01:11:13,217 --> 01:11:14,317
Mnh-mnh.

1341
01:11:14,318 --> 01:11:17,020
Here. Keep it.

1342
01:11:17,021 --> 01:11:19,290
Here. Hold it for me, then.

1343
01:11:26,030 --> 01:11:28,298
Sounds like you really made
an ass out of yourself.

1344
01:11:28,299 --> 01:11:29,999
I did. I did, man.

1345
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,335
I did. I did, man.

1346
01:11:32,103 --> 01:11:33,770
So, if you like
this girl Sarah so much,

1347
01:11:33,771 --> 01:11:36,540
<i>why didn't you
ask her out before?</i>

1348
01:11:36,541 --> 01:11:38,441
<i>Well, because it was
forbidden love.</i>

1349
01:11:38,442 --> 01:11:39,476
<i>What?</i>

1350
01:11:39,477 --> 01:11:41,745
<i>Well, fraternizing
is against the, uh,</i>

1351
01:11:41,746 --> 01:11:44,314
<i>the shop ease code of conduct,
you know?</i>

1352
01:11:44,315 --> 01:11:46,483
<i>Code of conduct?
Dude, it's a grocery store.</i>

1353
01:11:46,484 --> 01:11:48,653
<i>Hey, remember, I'm part owner,
all right?</i>

1354
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:58,128
Can you hold on for a second?
I'm just gonna go --

1355
01:11:58,129 --> 01:11:59,462
Kelly. Real quick. Hold on.

1356
01:11:59,463 --> 01:11:59,999
Are you sure? Please?

1357
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,364
Are you sure? Please?

1358
01:12:01,365 --> 01:12:02,733
Wait up.

1359
01:12:03,601 --> 01:12:05,369
One second.

1360
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:10,374
Lance.

1361
01:12:11,576 --> 01:12:13,410
I'm unarmed.

1362
01:12:13,411 --> 01:12:16,313
What, did you lose your pony,
you little pretty pony boy?

1363
01:12:16,314 --> 01:12:18,348
No. Come on.

1364
01:12:18,349 --> 01:12:19,716
I wanted to apologize.

1365
01:12:19,717 --> 01:12:21,351
For what, your existence?

1366
01:12:21,352 --> 01:12:24,421
No. I...

1367
01:12:24,422 --> 01:12:26,591
Me and my friends staged
the invasion that...

1368
01:12:29,093 --> 01:12:29,999
I'm not laughing
'cause it's funny.

1369
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:30,461
I'm not laughing
'cause it's funny.

1370
01:12:30,462 --> 01:12:32,429
I'm laughing 'cause I'm nervous.
We, uh...

1371
01:12:32,430 --> 01:12:33,763
Well, you know, actually,
it never happened.

1372
01:12:33,764 --> 01:12:36,100
It was a dream you had.

1373
01:12:37,635 --> 01:12:40,136
Well, I'm sorry
for the dream, okay?

1374
01:12:40,137 --> 01:12:42,440
All right. Fine.

1375
01:12:45,142 --> 01:12:46,509
We're good?

1376
01:12:46,510 --> 01:12:48,479
Almost.

1377
01:12:49,146 --> 01:12:50,414
What do you mean, almost?

1378
01:12:55,620 --> 01:12:57,488
Kelly!

1379
01:12:58,756 --> 01:12:59,999
Hey, Kelly.

1380
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:00,258
Hey, Kelly.

1381
01:13:00,259 --> 01:13:02,727
Hey. Hey.

1382
01:13:04,729 --> 01:13:05,695
Are you okay?

1383
01:13:05,696 --> 01:13:07,698
Yeah, I'm fine.

1384
01:13:11,035 --> 01:13:13,570
I deserved it.

1385
01:13:13,571 --> 01:13:15,672
Is it getting big?

1386
01:13:15,673 --> 01:13:17,041
Uh...

1387
01:13:18,476 --> 01:13:20,277
Better.

1388
01:13:20,278 --> 01:13:23,113
Are you finished now? No, no.

1389
01:13:23,114 --> 01:13:25,081
No. This is just the beginning.

1390
01:13:25,082 --> 01:13:27,250
See, because I find

1391
01:13:27,251 --> 01:13:29,999
that in order to get where
you need to go -- hey!

1392
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:30,121
That in order to get where
you need to go -- hey!

1393
01:13:30,122 --> 01:13:31,554
You know, you got to --

1394
01:13:31,555 --> 01:13:33,623
You got to cut through
all the other stuff first.

1395
01:13:33,624 --> 01:13:35,158
So, you know what I mean,
kind of?

1396
01:13:35,159 --> 01:13:37,127
Wait.
What are you talking about?

1397
01:13:37,128 --> 01:13:38,763
Wait!

1398
01:13:39,530 --> 01:13:42,165
Here. Give me a piggyback.
Give me a piggyback. Uh, no.

1399
