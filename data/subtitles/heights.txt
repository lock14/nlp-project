Come on! Let's go!



<i>I got him! I got him!</i>



Aah!



Shh.



Gunter?



<i>Guten morgen.</i>



<i>Commandant!</i>



Let's just get this over with.



Just kill me.



He wants to hear you squeal
like a puppy.



Beg for your life.



Beg for your life.



<i>Herr commandant!</i>



<i>Herr commandant.</i>



<i>Get down! Get down!</i>



Get back!



Now it's your turn
to do some begging.



Now it's your turn
to do some begging.



Please!



Mom, this really isn't
a good time.



Tell your mother to pick us up
in an hour.



In an hour,
you'll still be dead.



Can you pick me
and dad up in an hour?



And you're not even
supposed to have that.



I'm busy right now.
I can't talk.



Like you're one to talk
about the rules.



Like you're one to talk
about the rules.



Excuse me? Listen.



It's not my fault you guys suck, okay?
<i>Goodbye, mom.</i>



<i>It's not my fault. Goodbye!</i>



- Pull back!
- Pull back!



There's too many!



<i>That's it for today, folks.</i>



<i>Join us next week for the
attack on the siegfried line.</i>



<i>Hey, there, death wish.</i>



You got a name?



Bart bowland.



Bart bowland.



Name's Kelly ernswiler.



Name's Kelly ernswiler.



Nice to meet you.



Same.



<i>Whereabouts you live?</i>



Shaker heights.



You live in shaker heights?
I'm from the same place.



What street?



It's outside shaker.



But... I go to shaker high.



Langley prep.



You don't go to Langley.



You go to Langley?



Well, I would've went
to Langley.



If only my Polo pony
hadn't died.



If only my Polo pony
hadn't died.



Kelly, uh...



I've had three complaints
about you today.



I mean, you go off script.



Y-you steal a uniform
at knifepoint. So?



Well, the brigade's
been talking.



And if you don't chill out,



we're gonna follow
the regulatory procedures



for an official reprimand.



<i>Ooh. The threat of bureaucracy.
You got me shaking.</i>



You know, we could all easily
vote to permanently bar you



from any further partic--



He gets it, Duncan.



Don't waste your time.



So, is this willys yours?
Oh, yeah.



If you're still feeling suicidal, I
can run you over in her if you want.



I think the moment's passed.



All right.



Can I get a lift, though?



Want a lift?



I don't get it.



You go to the battles,
but you don't like the rules?



Well, I mean, I never met a rule
I didn't want to break.



Well, I mean, I never met a rule
I didn't want to break.



So what's the appeal?



Ladies love a man
in uniform, Bart.



My Langley uniform
hasn't done much for me.



It's a theory, you know?
It's yet to be proven.

You got quite a crib. You
should come over some time.



You can service our lawnmower.



I would, but, uh, then I might
soil my croquet whites.



You understand. Yeah.



See you around. All right. I'll
see you next weekend, Bart.



Sergeant Keller.



How was the war?



We win?



I'm making sandwiches
for care house.



Hey, pull up a chair.



<i>That's really nice, ming.</i>



It's really coming along.



It's really coming along.



Son of Eve, you look very dirty.



Oh, this is nothing.
You should see the other guy.



<i>Don't touch anything, okay?</i>



We're getting ready
for the starving artists show.



Can I talk to you, please?



<i>The gold has to be
more feathery.</i>



Like this. Not gloppy.



<i>Okay? Now you try it.</i>



Ma, do you know why we never
have food in this house?



I'm not having that argument
with you again.



Well, I'll tell you why.



Ming, now, you remember
what we said about the eyes?



They need to have
a little bit more empathy.



<i>We really need people
to feel like this horse</i>



<i>we really need people
to feel like this horse</i>



understands them, okay? Uh-huh.



That's why it's our biggest seller.
<i>I'll tell you why.</i>



It's because your husband
comes in here



and steals food
from his own family



to feed every druggie
in Cleveland



like it's not a problem.



Well, honey,
pick up a paintbrush.



We're ordering pizza later.



<i>No.
Some people have to work, mom.</i>



Can you drop this off
at the cleaners for me?



Oh, sweetie,
you know what we said



about paying for the war things.



<i>We don't support that.</i>



I don't understand
how you can reenact



the battle of the bulge
in 72-degree weather.



Didn't all those guys
freeze to death?



Well, a portable toilet fell
on a couple of guys.



Well, a portable toilet fell
on a couple of guys.



That's disgusting.



Well, war is hell.



Well, then why do you do it?



I feel you're never more alive



than when you're faced
with simulated death.



Maybe I should try it sometime.



You're William James Raleigh
of 101st airborne...



Hey! Pinned down in noville.



The Germans have the
high ground <i>whoa!</i>



<i>And are shelling
your position heavily.</i>



You're holed up in a stone barn,
running low on ammo. <i>Kelly!</i>



The cries of wounded men fill the air
like cries of hungry babies. <i>Ow!</i>



The cries of wounded men fill the air
like cries of hungry babies. <i>Ow!</i>



At 1:00 P.M., you lose radio
contact with headquarters.



<i>What do you do? What do you do?
What do you do?</i>



Kelly, stop it.



Battle of the bulge.



Southern shoulder, December '44.



Sorry I asked.



Hey.



<i>At least I wasn't, you know,
restocking rump roasts.</i>



<i>I'd like to remind everybody</i>



<i>about our upcoming field trip
to the battlefields.</i>



<i>About our upcoming field trip
to the battlefields.</i>



Uh, so far only two of you
have signed up.



<i>Um...</i>



Well, anyway, let's, uh,
let's move on to gettysburg.



At gettysburg, the union
soldiers,



they fought bravely on,
giving their lives



so that we may enjoy
the freedoms that we have today.



Bullshit.



Do you have something to say,
Mr. ernswiler?



Excuse me? No.



Excuse me? No.



It seems that you do.



Come on. Isn't your analysis
a tad simplistic?



I mean, maybe for a second-grade
history class, fine.



But to characterize the civil
war as some moral struggle, sir?



That's a joke. <i>A joke?</i>



Lance,
you're not helping things.



Da-- Mr. Norway.



Well, we -- we --
We all have our own opinions.



<i>Opinions? Soldiers were drafted.</i>



And the only ones who didn't have to fight
were the ones that could pay their way out.



Yes.



Yes.



Why don't you ever talk
about the draft riots, huh?



<i>Why don't you show slides</i>



o-of the victims tortured
and murdered



by the bloodthirsty mob
that was at those draft riots?



<i>How can you teach something</i>



<i>that you don't know
anything about?</i>



Kelly, we have to
stop meeting like this.



I mean, it's not my fault
the teachers here suck.



Listen.



I know that some
of the teachers around here



can be pretty trying
for you sometimes.



<i>But you've got to learn to work
in the system, not against it.</i>



Why is that?



Because growing up is
a hard enough process as it is.



Because growing up is
a hard enough process as it is.



Is that what your box
of tissues is for?



I see you're not going
to college next year.



What are your plans?



How am I gonna
get through to you?



Well, advertising executives
use status and sex



to appeal to my demographic.



Hey, g.I. Jane.



You disrespected my dad.
Give me a break.



I think you need to apologize to him.
To that chump? No way.



Why are you dicking with me,
you little dick?!



You want to play, dickface?



Wait.



You just used "dick" as a noun,
adjective, and a verb.



That's pretty impressive.



Thank you.



Okay.



Let's see what
little beetle Bailey



keeps in his knapsack
that makes him so intelligent.



Keeps in his knapsack
that makes him so intelligent.



Yard-sale crap!



Stop!



Hey, private!
Thanks for the hat.



<i>♪ Today is gonna be
a beautiful day ♪</i>



No. Come on!



No. Come on!



Foxy, it's me. Please.



Don't do this to me!



<i>♪ ...the usual thing ♪</i>

Keep moving, assholes.
Nothing to see here.



<i>Nice one.</i>



They should transfer you
to the signal corps.



They should transfer you
to the signal corps.



What happened?



Oh, man. Where do I start?



<i>Well, I can't do anything
about your Jeep.</i>



<i>But I can probably find you
another hat.</i>



Oh.



What?



Very impressive, man.



My dad's really into collecting.



What the hell?



What's this?



What's this?



It's Grant's field flask.



<i>He never went into battle
without it.</i>



You know what?



Oh!



Your dad should really meet
my history teacher.



The guy sent me
up the river today



for questioning his g-rated
interpretation of the civil war.



Here.



Take this. It'll shut him up.



Stonewall Jackson's.



What?



My dad's got so much junk
crammed in here



he doesn't even notice
when it's missing.



Before this,
it was antique duck decoys.



Before this,
it was antique duck decoys.



Ah, here it is.



I think it was Montgomery's.



It's yours now.



Are you serious?



- Yeah.
<i>- Bart?</i>



<i>Bart?</i>



Hey, dad. Hmm.



I was just, um, showing Kelly
some of your pieces.



He's really into this stuff.



Oh.



<i>Yeah.</i>



Is -- is that a... A field stool
from the New York 3rd?



My great-great-grandfather
was in the New York 3rd.



My great-great-grandfather
was in the New York 3rd.



That's amazing.



Kelly. Nice to meet you.



Nice to meet you.



It's a pleasure.
Knowledgeable young man.



I try.



You know, I used to share your
fascination for all things military.



Yeah, I can see.



Lately, though,
I've been exploring



a somewhat lighter side
of human culture.



Come on.



Um, I know I don't have to tell you, but
put everything back as you found it.



<i>The origin of nesting dolls
is shrouded in mystery.</i>



Some say the oldest
are from China.



Some say the oldest
are from China.



Still others say Japan.



<i>I don't have any of those, but the
ones I do have are from Russia.</i>



And the Russians perfected
the art of nesting dolls.



Now, this particular one here,



this is the crown Jewel
of my collection.



It has 13 levels,



going all the way down
to the teeny tiniest.



The baby.



Ruby.



Ruby. Huh.



Yeah. It's silly.
I call her Ruby.



Yeah. It's silly.
I call her Ruby.



Because if you look closely at her two
little eyes, they look like rubies.



My little Ruby baby.



Whoa! Oh, good god.



We should've just taken
the damn hat.



We'll get you one.



Ah.



I-I, uh, I have to get
a flashlight.



So why'd you let someone
take it?



My hat? Oh, I didn't let
anybody take it.



I just, uh, mouthed off
to the wrong person.



Sounds like your mouth gets you
in trouble a lot. It does.



Sounds like your mouth gets you
in trouble a lot. It does.



Is mom here?



I need to go over the music
with her.



Does it look like mom's here?



Your mom went shopping.
She'll be back in about an hour.



Oh, tabby, have you met
Bart's new friend Kelly?



Hi.



<i>Whatever you do,
do not give him any money.</i>



Hey, shut up.



Hey, you shut up.
He's wanted in three states.



That's funny.



We're paying attention
to you now. You happy?



I'm really happy.



I'm gonna go take a bath.



Will you tell me
when miner gets here?



Will you tell me
when miner gets here?



Thank you.



Who's miner?



Fiance.



<i>Aha!</i>



Ruby.



<i>Oh, you know, that frozen-food lady
came in today again with her kids.</i>



Oh, yeah? <i>They must eat out of</i>



those little cardboard trays
every day.



I think one of her kids even
looks like a piece of cardboard.



You know we have more flavors of cat
food here than we do baby food?



Really?



<i>Yeah.</i>



<i>Yeah.</i>



What do you think that says
about our culture?



I don't know what it says.
What do you think?



Mm.



I think working here is
very depressing.



<i>Well, then you should quit.</i>



I mean, you could get
any job you wanted to.



You think so? <i>Heck, yeah.</i>



Come on.



You're smart.



You got a good eye.



And you do the best promo stuff
in this store.



Well...



I mean, the thing you did
with juice boxes.



That was genius.



<i>Thanks.</i>



<i>Thanks.</i>



What are you gonna do? Enlist?



In the army?



And lose this?



No way.



<i>Hello?! Are you crazy?</i>



No way. Not happening.



Unh-unh. Hello?



If the store is closed,



it shouldn't have a sign
that says 24 hours!



Okay. I'll be right there.



I don't want to be here
when my coupons expire.



Okay.



Morning, private Ryan.



Like my new hat?



Yeah, actually.
I got one just like it.



It's just mine's
infested with lice.



Really? You're just a regular
carrot top, aren't you?



Oh, my god.



<i>You know, one day,
me and you are gonna be alone.</i>



Won't that be nice?



Too bad my mom
won't let me date yet, huh?



Too bad my mom
won't let me date yet, huh?



<i>That's a good one, buddy.
You got dental insurance?</i>



Why do you mess with him?
You're right.



I should give him a break.
I mean it.



<i>The allies launched
a counteroffensive</i>



<i>two days before the new year.</i>



Kelly, you're home.
Thank goodness.



<i>Move.</i>



I need you to go
to the art supply store for me.



I'm not going. Get Abe to do it.



Abe was going -- he had to lead
a meeting at care house.



What do you need?



I phoned in the order.



I phoned in the order.



Is it a big order?



No. Thank you.



It better not be a big order.



<i>Kelly, right?</i>



Hi.



Uh, so they're having
a glitter sale... Looks like.



What happened to you?



What happened --
Oh, my eye.



Uh, I had a tennis injury
a while back.



No big thing.



So, you paint?



Uh, yeah, y-you know.
It's a weird question to ask.



How so?



How so?



I don't feel comfortable
calling anything done



since the renaissance
painting, you know?



<i>I mean, we might have
more experimental interaction</i>



with the picture plane,
but as far as skills go,



you know, we're suffering
a great deal.



Okay.



Uh, so, uh, I-i got a question.



<i>I see you're working
with acrylics.</i>



Mm-hmm. Why? Isn't
oil much richer?



Oh, not another oil snob.



I'm not an oil snob. It's just
isn't acrylic a bit jejune?



Jejune?



Yeah. Well, it means --



I know what it means.



I know what it means.



How old are you, anyway?



Older than my years.



Really? Yeah.



And you paint?



Well, you know, my mom's
an artist, so I --



Oh, that explains it.



That explains --
What does that explain?



<i>Wait, wait, wait.</i>



Doesn't anybody believe in
innate knowledge anymore?



I mean, you know, Michelangelo
was 15 when he painted the inf--



Uh, far-- far--
Farness.



The infanta. Fanta.
That's what I meant.



The infanta. Fanta.
That's what I meant.



Well, actually,
infantas are Spanish.



Michelangelo was Italian.



Spanish, yeah.
Well, uh, exactly.



Y-you know, one world,
one people.



Just like Jesse Jackson
envisioned, you know?



Smart guy. Hi, sweetie.



Oh, I'm just running errands
right now.



Yeah. I should be home
in about an hour.



See you later. All right.



What the hell did I just say?



What the hell did I just say?



What the hell did I just say?



Jesse Jackson?



Christ.



Dad?



<i>Dad?</i>



<i>Dad?</i>



Dad, get up. <i>Aah!</i>



Sorry.



Hey, pop.



Keller.



<i>You know, a funny thing
just happened to me.</i>



I thought you were dead
on the couch.



Oh, you mean Emmett.



Oh, they didn't have
any empty beds at care house.



<i>Emmett?</i> Uh-huh.



<i>Emmett?</i> Uh-huh.



So you bring him to our house?



Why don't you
ever think about --



Maybe he might be dangerous
to me and mom.



<i>Hmm?
Or steal all of our furniture.</i>



He needed a place
to sleep tonight.



Well, having him here makes it
feel more like home, anyway.



Hey, I've been straight
for five years, almost six.



That's a third of your life.



Big deal.



I've been straight
the whole time.



<i>That there's
actual sand from iwo jima.</i>



Or your sister's fish tank.



<i>Well, it don't come with no
certificate of authenticity.</i>



<i>Actually, I'm in the market
for an airborne cap.</i>



<i>It's for my friend here.</i>



I got one.
Can't sell it to you, though.



You sure?



Has a lot of sentimental value.



Yeah. How much?



Yeah. How much?



A lot.



What's this?



General ulysses s. Grant's
field flask, my friend.



And if that's the collected works
of baudelaire, throw it in.



We'll call it even.



Listen, Bart.
I really don't need it that bad.



No worries.



See, you got it all wrong.



War is just failed diplomacy.



War is just failed diplomacy.



Well, if you hate it so much, why
do you keep going to the battles?



Mm.



It looks good
on college applications.



You're going to college?



I got no choice.



Mm.



What happened to your face?



Oh.



Uh, remember that guy Lance
I told you about?



The same guy?



<i>He's one pissed off
little munchkin.</i>



What are you gonna do about it?



Nothing.



Nothing?
W-what do you mean, nothing?



On the battlefield, you were running
around like Rambo on steroids.



On the battlefield, you were running
around like Rambo on steroids.



That's different. I mean, that's
just playing around, you know?



So?



Haven't you ever heard of the
193rd special operations wing?



Never.



You want to get this guy?



<i>Target?</i>



<i>Lance Norway.</i>



<i>Objective?</i>



Humiliation.



Rage. Despair.



Easy enough.



Nam's probably our go-to war
for that sort of thing. Okay.



I got the declassified briefs



from the Phoenix project
around here.



I knew my dad's crap
would come in handy.



I knew my dad's crap
would come in handy.



Hey, guys.



I've got some stretcher bars
out in my car.



Do you think one of you
can help me bring them in?



Of course.



We'll drop what we're doing because what
you're doing must be more important.



It is.



Sure.



I mean, uh, I'll help.



<i>Thanks.</i>



What is your...



I'll find those reports.



Perfect. Thanks.



It's the waterfront.



No. As the viewer,
I get to decide what it is.



And it doesn't look anything
like a waterfront to me.



It's the light.
I was playing with diffusion.



Put it away when you're done
with it, all right?



Very funny.



This is really nice, though.



This is really nice, though.



It must be nice to have a place
like this to get away to, huh?



Yeah, it is. It's great.



So, w-what about farmer?



Farmer?



Yeah, the boyfriend.



Miner?



Miner. I'm sorry.



<i>Miner. Okay.</i>



Well, what about --
Is -- is he an artist, too?



So, you said your mom
was a painter?



Oh, she used to be.



She -- she still is, I guess.



Uh, she had to turn it into
a business, so, you know --



Uh, she had to turn it into
a business, so, you know --



'cause my dad stopped working.



So now we got this -- this
family of Chinese immigrants



living in the house,
making them for her.



Kind of like
Andy warhol's factory?



No, not his factory.



More like, uh, more like
Andy warhol's toolshed.



<i>It's nice, though, you know?
I'm not -- I'm not dissing it.</i>



<i>I used to have my playpen
in her studio.</i>



Huh.
So, why'd your dad stop working?



H-he's a vh1 documentary
without the music.



Damn it, Kelly.



<i>I can't plan your revenge
by myself.</i>



<i>I can't plan your revenge
by myself.</i>



Come on!



Have fun, boys.



Fun. If only war were fun.



War is deadly serious, ma'am.



You know, I'm kind of worried



about you playing
with diffusion unsupervised.



Are you? <i>Yeah.</i>



Might have to come by and show you
some of the proper safety procedures.



I don't think I have room
in here for a playpen.



<i>Hey, Sarah, wait up. Wait up. Uh,
do you got the math homework?</i>



<i>Why? So you can cheat?</i>



<i>Well, yeah. Can I?</i>



<i>No.</i>



<i>Um, but I-I'll tell you what.</i>



I have, um, an extra ticket
to aerosmith on Friday night.



Is that gonna be loud?



Yeah. I-it's gonna be loud.
It's music.



Yeah.



Well, you know, it might be
really good for you to get out



and mingle
with some normal people.



And mingle
with some normal people.



Something could rub off
on you... I hope.



Well, we'll talk about it
on the night shift, yes?



Okay.



<i>Citizens,</i>



<i>this is the emergency broadcast
notification system.</i>



This is not a test
of the system.



<i>This is an actual no--</i>



Damn.



That was pretty good
except for the end.



Nah.



Don't you love being a minor?
I mean, think about it.



There's no consequences
for illegal activities.



There's no consequences
for illegal activities.



You're not responsible
if the economy goes bad.



<i>No drinking. No credit.</i>



No freedom.
At least not in my house.



You know, you talk about it,
but I never see it.



My parents do their best work
without an audience.



Oh, yeah? Like what?



Do you think I picked dartmouth?



You didn't pick it?



No.



What about tabby?



Tabby.



She got to go where she wanted.
Sarah Lawrence.



She got to go where she wanted.
Sarah Lawrence.



Six years.



She's going to grad school,
though. Yale.



She goes to Yale?



Wow. I didn't even think
people went to Yale.



Well, she drives off in her car
in September.



<i>But for all we know,
she pulls over in Albany</i>



and sleeps there until may.



What do you mean?



Joke.



That was a joke? That's
what they sound like? <i>Yeah.</i>



For some reason, I always
thought they'd be funnier.



For some reason, I always
thought they'd be funnier.



Well...



Wait. I-isn't Sarah Lawrence
a school for lesbians?



How's their football team?



<i>Vermont!</i>



<i>Oh, remember the milbecks' place</i>



<i>in lake champlain, darling?</i>



<i>And what was
that wonderful cheese</i>



<i>that we had on the sandwiches
in the restaurant there?</i>



Gouda.



Yes. Gouda.



Are you sure? Yes. Gouda.



Anyway, the great thing
about middlebury



is that the French department
is awesome.



Is that the French department
is awesome.



French. What are you going to do
with that, write poetry?



<i>You know,
they predict that China</i>



is going to be the largest
market of the 21st century.



Maybe I should
take Chinese, then.



<i>Mandarin is actually
the most-spoken dialect.</i>



But the Chinese speak hundreds
of different distinct languages.



<i>Speaking of which, tabby, honey,</i>



have you finished
the seating arrangement yet?



Mom, can we just talk about
something else for once?



Well, darling, we have to take
the list to the calligrapher.



Hmm.



Hmm.



<i>Tabby?</i>



Well, you know, uh...



Speaking of calligraphy
and the Chinese...



<i>The...</i>



The Chinese peoples
invented calligraphy.



They did.



But I-i tend to stray away from
saying, um, "invent" too often



just because it reinforces
patriarchal stereotypes.



<i>As we all know.</i>



Exactly.



Men invent. Women give birth.



<i>Although...</i>



Women invented babies.



<i>Right, uh, but...</i>



Babies gave birth to man.



What an unusual conversation.



Do you have discussions
like this at home



with your family, Kelly?



My family, uh, they're similar.
Little different.



<i>He does know how to talk
about art.</i>



Do you?



Do you?



You do?



Uh, my mother's
kind of an artist.



So I pick up very quickly
on that kind of stuff.



So you come from
a creative family, do you?



I do.



<i>Oh, I wish I could get
my boys to talk to me</i>



<i>about any of my passions.</i>



Just try to get them near
the subject of my garden.



Oh. <i>Speaking of, Mrs. bowland,</i>



I saw your magnolias.
Very fine specimens.



<i>Oh, thank you.</i>



They are fine, aren't they?



They're gorgeous.



I just think that flowers
are so... Sen--



Sensual.



Sensual.



<i>Yep. It looks empty.</i>



<i>Lance must be out torturing
puppies or something.</i>



<i>Let me see.</i>



So, you have a thing
for my sister?



What? No.



Everybody does.



Everybody does.



I don't.



Bart, I don't.



All right. The coast is clear.



Let's get a closer look.



Come on.



Tabby and I just have
a few things in common.



Oh, really? Like what?



Oh, really? Like what?



Like what?
I can't tell you about that.



It's my feminine side.



You don't wear
women's clothes, do you?



Hey, feeling pretty
is not a crime, all right?



Whatever.



Bart.



<i>Bart, why?</i>



What -- Bart! Bart!



Bart!



Bart!



Can I help you, young man?



Can I help you, young man?



Uh, what? What?



Kelly?



Mr. Norway!



I was looking for my Merlin.



Your what?



Uh, I had a box
of purple kiffnits.



My friends threw it over.
A little purple box.



Pardon?



You haven't seen it?
Yeah, I'm coming.



Will you excuse me for a second?



What?



Bart.



Shit.



Bart!



Are you crazy? Yes.



But now we know the layout of
the entire house. Come on!



<i>Okay. Duncan said he'd get
like 10 guys to help us out.</i>



<i>Cool. Cool.</i> And one of them's
gonna videotape the whole thing.



And I'll -- I'll tell you
something, Bart.



Is that once we get that tape
played on the school TV station,



it's gonna be all over but the
shouting, you know what I mean?



It's gonna be all over but the
shouting, you know what I mean?



Only a few more days
till the field trip



<i>and operation mincemeat.</i>



To mincemeat.



To enemies.



To enemies, too.



<i>Man.</i>



You know what's funny?
It's funny.



It's like everything was good
for a while, you know?



It's like everything was good
for a while, you know?



Everything was fine.



And then, uh...
I got angry, you know?



<i>At my dad, mostly.</i>



And then I just started...



I just started saying
whatever popped into my head.



And now I... Can't stop.



Know what I mean?



Bart?



Hey.



I warned you I'd come.



All right. I'm gonna go, then.



<i>What do you want?</i>



<i>Um...</i>



Inspiration.



I had this idea for a painting.



Thought maybe I could
come in here and paint it.



Thought maybe I could
come in here and paint it.



Okay.



You can, uh, grab a canvas
in the corner.



<i>There's paintbrushes in the jar.</i>



<i>Paint's on the shelves.</i>



Okay.



Oh, I don't have much time --



<i>Am I messing up your concentration,
me being here like this?</i>



No. It's fine.



No. It's fine.



<i>So, um, when's -- when's
your wedding happening?</i>



Uh, next week.



I'd rather not talk about it.



Why? Is something wrong?



No.



What are you painting?



I'm painting...



Really, there's just --
There's just so many layers



of imaginistic symbolism in here



that I wouldn't even feel
comfortable summing it all up.



<i>All right.</i>



It's this reoccurring
dream I have



of a mermaid riding
a rocket ship.



A rocket ship? How?



Well, she's riding it
sidesaddle.



She's a mermaid. She's got a
fish tail, for Christ's sake.



Okay.



The most important thing,
of course, though,



um, is empathy.



Um, is empathy.



Just 'cause you want
the viewer to feel like



the mermaid understands them,
you know?



Do you have any idea
what you're talking about?



Does it matter? <i>Well, I mean,</i>



sometimes people say
what they really think.



Okay, smarty.



Well, then, w-what if --
What if, uh,



people don't know
what they really think?



Doesn't matter.



You just... Be yourself.



Well, that sounds boring to me.



Well, that sounds boring to me.



No. It's not boring.



It's scary and wonderful
and exciting.



Really? What's so exciting
about being yourself?



<i>Hey. Hi.</i>



There you are.



<i>Hi.</i> Hi.



Hey. Miner weber.



Weber miner.



Kelly.



This is Kelly.



Kelly ernswiler.
It's a pleasure.



Uh, so, what have we got,



uh, so, what have we got,



a little painting class
going on here, huh?



He's one of Bart's friends. He paints.
Yeah? That's great. Listen.



<i>If we're gonna be on time for
dinner, we got to get going.</i>



Okay. I'm gonna grab my coat.



All right.



So you paint, huh?



Yeah. You know, just started.



Right.



<i>So, what do you do
in your spare time?</i>



You a hobby man?



You're still in high school?



Yeah, I am.



But I also moonlight as a
stock boy over at the shop ease.



But I also moonlight as a
stock boy over at the shop ease.



And president don kaminsky says
every employee is part owner.



So I guess you could say
I'm a captain of industry



<i>in training.</i>



Sort of, um, a capitalist larva.



Wow. That's quite an image.



Only if you see
the most magical part.



Do you see it?



No. What is it?



One day, I'm gonna be
a beautiful butterfly, right?



<i>But first, I have to be a pupa.</i>



And pupas don't really
go out that much,



so I don't think I'm gonna be
going out that much.



So I don't think I'm gonna be
going out that much.



Pupa.



The awkward adolescents
of the insect world.



<i>All set.</i>



Um, about time. Let's go.



Oh, Kelly, if you want,
you can stay.



No, thanks. I got to go to work.



Know what this is right here?



What? 18 volts of pure freedom.



Have you been in
the cough syrup aisle again?



Perhaps.



Hey, have you thought any more
about that concert?



Hey, have you thought any more
about that concert?



Um, yeah, Sarah.



I don't really think
that's a good idea.



Why not?



It's kind of a date, isn't it?



Um...



I don't know.



'Cause if it is,
I'm not gonna be able to go



'cause I'm kind of seeing
somebody at the moment.



You're seeing somebody?



I'm not --
I'm not <i>seeing</i> her.



But, uh, we're about to see...
I'm about to see her.



Yeah. Well, who --
I mean...



Yeah. Well, who --
I mean...



You know, if you don't mind
me asking, who is she?



S-she's, uh...



You don't know her.



She's not, you know,
somebody you know.



Is she a mail-order bride
or something?



Okay. That's good, Jeffrey.



Hey, numbnuts.



Trying to do a project here.



Why don't you pull
a little weight?



Oh, I think you can color inside
the lines by yourself, don't you?



You know, I think so.



But actually,
I forgot my nontoxic crayons.



So why don't you do it for me,
diaper baby?



<i>My dad has this friend
who's a director.</i>



<i>He's shooting a documentary
for the history channel.</i>



That's cool.



He needs some guys
to reenact a battle



from the allied offensive
for him.



We're gonna be
on the history channel?



I haven't asked you yet.



Well, ask me, then.



Stop. Seriously. Put it away.
Come on. Ask me.



Stop. Seriously. Put it away.
Come on. Ask me.



Ask me.



Well, if you want to, next week.



But you have to
take it seriously.



Of course I will.
I always take it seriously.



From what I've seen,



you play fast and loose
with your characterizations.



I'm fast and loose?



You're fast and loose.



I play the emotional truth.
I make it real.



Like back in the dining room?



What was that?



"I've noticed your magnolias.
Very fine specimens."



"I've noticed your magnolias.
Very fine specimens."



That was real?



What the hell does that
have to do with anything?



You seem to have
your own agenda, that's all.



Well, Bart,
I do have my own agenda.



What other reason is there
to do anything?



I'm just saying,



I know the difference
between fantasy and reality.



Oh, okay.



So you're saying that
I-i don't know the difference?



I don't --
I don't know.



You don't know what, Bart?



You don't know
if you just said that to me?



<i>It's just...</i>



It's just nervous energy
before a big mission.



It's natural.



Right.



Nerves.



See you at 0400.



I'll be there at 0400.



<i>And if I don't sell them there,</i>



<i>I'll set up on the corner
of Stevenson Lane.</i>



That's a good location.



Are you listening to me?



Did you put more red pepper
in this than usual?



Did you put more red pepper
in this than usual?



No. It's the same as always.



<i>Honey, you should eat.</i>



I'm not hungry.



Kelly, want some dinner?



I ate.



One day, we'll all be happy.



I won't know what to do
with myself.



<i>This is shaker heights.</i>



<i>We're under attack.
I repeat, under attack.</i>



<i>This is not a test or a drill.</i>



<i>This is an actual emergency.</i>



<i>Enemy troops are fanning out,</i>



<i>and we're not quite sure where
they're coming from just yet.</i>



<i>In fact, very little is known about
our invaders at the present time.</i>



<i>What little we know is that
they're ruthless, organized,</i>



<i>and we strongly urge you
to stay inside your homes</i>



<i>and do not try
to defend yourselves!</i>



<i>These people are
easily pissed off</i>



<i>these people are
easily pissed off</i>



<i>and extremely dangerous!
 That's correct, bill.</i>



<i>We've just received word that the local
police force has been overthrown.</i>



<i>Just the sheer size
of this invasion is staggering.</i>



<i>Also, we've been told
by a reliable source</i>



<i>that any aggressive action
toward the attackers...</i>



<i>They're everywhere! People,
please, don't risk any action.</i>



<i>There's really little that anyone
can do to stop these people.</i>



<i>Get under a table.
Cover your head.</i>



Aah!



<i>They're in the building!</i>



<i>They're in the building!</i>



Get him!



Aah!



Bring him down here.
Come on. Drag him outside.



Let go of me! Let go!



Come on!



<i>Please! Put him down!</i>



Right there!



Where are the purple kiffnits?



What?



Give us the Merlins!



What?! <i>Cooperate
or die like dog!</i>



Please don't hurt me!



<i>Please don't hurt me.</i>
You know too much already.



Look, please! I'm not --
I'm not gonna tell anybody.



Your whimpering sickens us.
You die now!



Your whimpering sickens us.
You die now!



Please don't do it!



Enough!



Oh, damn.



Mission accomplished, I'd say.



Yeah. Can't ask for
more than that.



Move out! Go! Go! Go!



We have to talk.



Not now. I got to go to school.



Your father's in the hospital.



Again?



Unbelievable.
Which junkie is it now?



It's him.



<i>They called the western front
the "sausage factory."</i>



And not in --
In a positive sense.



<i>Sure, we all like hot dogs.</i>



<i>But this had a decidedly
negative connotation.</i>



Anything to add, Mr. ernswiler?



Uh, no, sir.



Good.



<i>Now, uh, on to the --
The offensive weaponry.</i>



<i>Now, uh, on to the --
The offensive weaponry.</i>



Um, mustard gas.



<i>So, filming on Saturday.</i>



Are you excited?



He's got an explosive
expert coming.



It's gonna be awesome.



They want you to come dressed
like wonder woman.



<i>That cool?</i>



What's the matter with you?



Well, he hasn't been
at school in two days.



You know, I'm starting to worry
a little bit.



You know, I'm starting to worry
a little bit.



I'm sure he's fine.



Are you sure he's fine?



<i>How are you so sure?</i>



Who are you calling?



<i>Hello?</i>



Lance, please.



<i>Just a minute.</i>



Give me the phone. <i>Lance, honey!</i>



<i>Phone!</i>



Give me the phone.



<i>I got it, dad.</i>



<i>I got it, dad.</i>



See that? He's fine.



Maybe you should think about
something else,



like... What are you gonna do
after graduation?



Well, nice segue.



<i>You sound like your dad.</i>



All right. You can joke.



But he was talking about
helping you out.



You want to go to dartmouth?



Are you serious?



He was.



<i>He could pull some strings.</i>



I don't know, man.



I don't know if that'll work
for me, you know?



I don't know if that'll work
for me, you know?



I'm not socially ready for that.
You know what I mean?



<i>Well, tell that to my family.</i>



They're like
your little fan club.



<i>Even tabby likes you.</i>



She say that to you?



You read it in her diary
or something?



Well, she invited you
to the wedding.



<i>But you probably
wouldn't want to do that.</i>



<i>So I'll --</i>
What -- weddings?



Bro, I love weddings.



Me and weddings.
Right here. Like this.



In fact, every time
I'm at weddings,



<i>I usually get wasted and --
And dry-hump someone's aunt.</i>



Well, good.



Well, good.



I'll, uh, call
my mom's aunt Maureen



and, uh, tell her to expect
a little action.



Maureen, huh? Pretty name.



Yeah. Little advice, though.
Don't look right at the goiter.



It's...



Tabby?



So, you invited me
to your wedding?



There isn't gonna be a wedding.



W-why? W-what happened?



Miner kissed this woman
he works with.



Honestly, I didn't think



you guys were right
for each other, anyway.



You didn't, huh?



Like -- like this painting,
for instance.



You see this painting?



If you were to stare at this
for too long,



<i>you wouldn't know what it was.</i>



<i>But for somebody who just
comes in and sees it,</i>



they know exactly what it is,
you know what I mean?



I don't need any bullshit
right now.



He couldn't understand you,
tabby.



He couldn't understand you,
tabby.



I'm not as complicated
as you think.



I...I didn't say
you were complicated.



I'm really sorry, tabby.



<i>Come on. Don't cry.</i>



No. Don't cry.



Please.



There you go.



You like me, don't you?



Of course.



No. I mean...



You like me.



I think you're amazing.



<i>Bart!
What are you doing out there?</i>



<i>Bart!
What are you doing out there?</i>



<i>Mom?</i>



<i>Mom?</i>



<i>Uh, vehicles are
supposed to show up.</i>



<i>Let me know what shows up.</i>



You look perfect.



You think so?



Yeah, it's been seasoning
under my bed for a little bit.



Yeah, it's been seasoning
under my bed for a little bit.



Put a little work into it.



Uh, some of the other boys are
over at craft services.



Okay.



The snack table.



Oh, craft services is
the snack table. Okay.



Um, uh, let me show --



Know what kind of vehicles
show up before lunch because --



Is Bart bowland here?



I have no idea. Excuse me.



So, I want a medium shot
coming down from here with...



All right, everybody.
We're gonna start positioning.



Uh, you, you, and you,
I want you over by that tree.



You and all of you guys,
you're up behind the hill.



All right. Whose Jeep is that?



That mg? <i>Yeah.</i>



She's mine.



Great.
We're gonna need to use it.



Can you take it up behind
the hill over there?



Sure.



Um, did Bart bowland
check in yet?



<i>I don't know. It doesn't matter.
We've got enough people.</i>



Well, he's gonna -- <i>all right.
Places, please!</i>



Let's go!



Let's go!



Password!



Where the hell you been?



Nowhere.



<i>It really wasn't smart
of you, man.</i>



I mean, they got me
driving old lippy.



And I'm gonna get
a crapload of close-ups.



And what are you wearing?



Where's your kit at?



I ought to kill you right now.



I ought to kill you right now.



What?



You had to do it.



What are you --
Do what?



You just... Do
whatever the hell you want.



And consequences,
they don't matter, do they?



I don't know
what you're talking about.



I'm talking about
your agenda again, Kelly,



which apparently includes
hitting on my sister!



<i>Okay. Picture is up.</i>



<i>Roll camera.</i> mark.



What did you think
she was gonna do?



Run off with you?



<i>You're a 17-year-old bag boy.</i>



<i>You're a 17-year-old bag boy.</i>



She is a Yale grad student.



Talk about living in
a fucking fantasy world!



Action!



Cue the Jeep!



Bart, what do you want me to do?



You want me to be miserable
like you are? I can do that.



Will it make it any better?



You got it all figured out,
don't you?



<i>Cue the Jeep!</i>
Better than you do...



Daddy's boy.



Aah! Hey! Hey!



Cue the Jeep!



Hey! Get out of the way!



<i>It's cool. We can use it.
We can just --</i>



We'll -- we'll edit it together
with some newsreel footage.



It -- it'll be fine.



It -- it'll be fine.



What?



Where have you been?



Listen, ma.



Can we talk about this tomorrow?



Your father's gone downhill.
They have him on dialysis.



Well, that's perfect.



Why would you say
something like that?



Why would you say
something like that?



I don't know.
It just seems to fit.



Seems to fit?



Do you understand
what I just said?



No, ma.
Why don't you say it again?



When are you going to
forgive him?



When am I gonna forgive him?



<i>That's quite a question, ma.</i>



When am I gonna forgive him?
Hmm.



I-I don't know.



Maybe -- maybe when I forget
all the lyrics



to "the little mermaid"
soundtrack that he'd play



to "the little mermaid"
soundtrack that he'd play



every time he'd take me
so he could go score.



<i>Maybe when we don't live in
a house that's always for sale.</i>



I don't know. I don't --



You know, I'll forgive him
when I go to college.



That's when I'll forgive him.



<i>I can't go, can I?</i>



'Cause he took all the money
out of my college fund



and bought Mexican black tar
with it.



And you're asking me
to forgive this guy.



No way.



All right.
Come with me to the hospital.



Okay.



This isn't about you anymore.



This isn't about you anymore.



It's never about me.



What is wrong with you?



<i>I'm so sick of you being angry.</i>



<i>I want to be angry.</i> Mom, enough.



You will not tell me
what is enough.



You don't know about anything.
You...



I'm talking about the man
I love.



Hey, Kelly.



Hey, look. I just --



I thought you should know
that I gave my notice, okay?



<i>Kelly?</i>



<i>Kelly?</i>



Oh, hi, Mrs. bowland.



Bart's not here, honey.



Bart's not here, honey.



Actually, I was, uh,
going to see tabby.



Oh.



Uh, well, tabby's
at her final fitting.



Wedding's tomorrow.



Damn it!



God damn.



Oh...



Oh...



<i>Is everyone in their places?</i>



Yes.



And the organist?



Ready.



Where are the cars?



They'll be here
in a few minutes.



Calm down.



What the hell are you doing?



What do you mean? I was invited.



I uninvited you.



You unin--
It's not your wedding, Bart.



Why are you wearing that?



Look. I can't let you come in.



Why not?



Because you know why.



Just go home.



Just go home.



Bart...



Kelly!



What are you doing?



Just listen.



This is my wedding day.



I know what day it is.
I know what day it is.



Where do I fit in
in all of this? Huh?



Where do I fit in
in all of this? Huh?



<i>I mean, I-i thought
we really had something.</i>



You know it wasn't like that.



No, I don't know
it wasn't like that.



<i>What was it?</i>



It was a moment.



A moment? What the hell is that?



What do you want to do?
Do you want to stop the wedding?



No. I don't --
I...



Oh, come on.



You... You shouldn't marry
this guy.



Why?



You're an artist.
Do you know what I mean?



You're an artist, and he --



You're an artist, and he --



He's not into --
You know what I mean?



He's, um...



What is he? What does he do?



I still don't know.



<i>He's like a corporate,
money-making money manager.</i>



It just doesn't add up.



But that's the thing.



It -- it doesn't always add up.



<i>Tabby, honey,
are you coming out?</i>



<i>Kissing you made me feel
something I needed to.</i>



<i>That's all it was.</i>



I'm getting married right now.



And I would like you
to be happy for me.



And I would like you
to be happy for me.



Okay?



<i>Here she is!</i>



<i>Kelly.</i>



Hey.



<i>We're just about to start.
What, are you taking off?</i>



Yeah.



What are you wearing?



I grew out of my old suit.



<i>Oh, yeah? Me too.</i>



Check it out. Rental.



Check it out. Rental.



It's funny, you know?
A day like this in a guy's life,



he doesn't even wear
his own clothes.



Yeah.



It's just another thing that
doesn't feel real, you know?



<i>Especially after everything
tabby and I have been through.</i>



No.



It shouldn't feel that way,
you know?



Today's the most important day
of your life.



No.



No, man.
This is just the beginning.



No, man.
This is just the beginning.



<i>I mean, everybody screws up.</i>



<i>But it's what you do afterwards
that counts, you know?</i>



Got to go.



See you.



You're looking good.



Keller.



Keller.



Out of bed, huh?



Yeah.



Feeling better?



Yeah. Better.



They don't give you shoes?



No, no. They're over there.



You, uh, you want to watch
some TV?



<i>Look at that.
They bolted it to the wall.</i>



My reputation precedes me.



My reputation precedes me.



Come on.



So, any, uh,
any battles this weekend?



A few.



He looks good.



So, you're new here, huh?



You got any hobbies?



Well, that's good.



Thanks for your help. Really.



<i>I'm not gonna tell anybody! Your
whimpering sickens us! You die now!</i>



Please don't do it! <i>Enough!</i>



<i>If you'd like to leave a message</i>



<i>for the bowlands, or Ruby,
please do so after the beep.</i>



<i>Uh, hey, bowlands.</i>



<i>Um... It's Kelly.</i>



<i>Um... It's Kelly</i>



<i>just calling to say
that, um, I'm really sorry</i>



<i>that I made a mess
out of the festivities</i>



<i>that happened last week.</i>



<i>And, um...</i>



<i>And, Bart, uh, you know, I'm
heading down to the rat's nest</i>



<i>to sell off some of my stuff, so any --
any chance you want to catch me there,</i>



<i>uh, that's where
I can be caught.</i>



You're gonna make a killing.



Yeah.



Yeah.
