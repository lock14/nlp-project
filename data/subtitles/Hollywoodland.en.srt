2
00:01:11,322 --> 00:01:14,241
- Now how the hell should I know?
- You said he was distraught.

3
00:01:14,325 --> 00:01:15,659
I didn't say I knew why.

4
00:01:15,785 --> 00:01:17,953
I mean, you don't
look too happy, either.

5
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:20,497
Will you excuse me?

6
00:01:20,665 --> 00:01:24,626
That's the fiancée of the deceased.
Miss Leonore Lemmon.

7
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:28,672
The one on the end is a houseguest.
Robert Condon.

8
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:32,384
The other two are friends,
Carol Van Ronkel and Bill Bliss.

9
00:01:32,468 --> 00:01:33,760
Bliss found the body.

10
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:36,346
- What time the party start?
- Just after midnight.

11
00:01:36,764 --> 00:01:39,933
He woke up, came downstairs,
20 minutes, half an hour,

12
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:42,143
said good night and went back to bed.

13
00:01:42,228 --> 00:01:45,021
The coroner's ruling,
it indicated suicide.

14
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:50,485
Paterson.

15
00:01:51,988 --> 00:01:53,154
Yeah.

16
00:02:06,168 --> 00:02:08,712
The fiancée said he was depressed.

17
00:02:10,298 --> 00:02:12,716
Also predicted he would do it.

18
00:02:13,551 --> 00:02:17,095
He went upstairs, she told her pals
he was going to shoot himself.

19
00:02:18,222 --> 00:02:19,723
So, why didn't she stop him?

20
00:02:21,183 --> 00:02:23,810
Maybe she believed
what she saw on TV.

21
00:02:24,937 --> 00:02:26,104
On TV?

22
00:02:31,444 --> 00:02:32,819
What, him?

23
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:34,779
Faster than a speeding bullet.

24
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:48,144
Oh, hi.

25
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:52,732
I have new information.

26
00:03:58,155 --> 00:03:59,280
Good.

27
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:03,535
I went to the office on Rossmore.

28
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:06,830
The office
is occupied by an orthodontist.

29
00:04:08,207 --> 00:04:11,000
You can imagine my consternation.

30
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:13,878
We're setting up in a better location.

31
00:04:14,672 --> 00:04:17,715
It's right off Wilshire,
adding an operative.

32
00:04:17,967 --> 00:04:22,053
But delays, phone lines.
So, the time being...

33
00:04:22,138 --> 00:04:26,015
We have reason to believe that
my wife continues to engage in illicit

34
00:04:27,435 --> 00:04:28,935
carnal relations.

35
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:33,731
I'm gonna take care of the mail.

36
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:35,316
Good.

37
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,072
Mr Sinclair.

38
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:46,619
We did check into that and
there was nothing we came up with.

39
00:04:46,704 --> 00:04:49,414
Yes, well, in that regard,
I blame myself.

40
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:52,250
How's that?

41
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:59,424
My wife became aware
of a change in my demeanour

42
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:02,260
and curtailed her activities accordingly.

43
00:05:06,724 --> 00:05:10,226
- She still at Western Costume?
- I drop her off there every morning.

44
00:05:10,728 --> 00:05:12,270
What transpires after that...

45
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:14,564
- All right, the fee is...
- $50 a day.

46
00:05:14,607 --> 00:05:16,816
Three-day minimum, in advance.

47
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:25,909
We'll do everything we can.

48
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:39,506
It's not right, you know.

49
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:41,758
His money.

50
00:05:42,218 --> 00:05:43,551
He's nuts.

51
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:55,855
Don't give me grief, okay? Nobody said
you had to stay in Van Nuys.

52
00:05:56,065 --> 00:05:58,691
You're the one that wanted a backyard.

53
00:06:01,904 --> 00:06:03,446
What did I say?

54
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,455
Disneyland.

55
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:15,124
He like it?

56
00:06:15,251 --> 00:06:18,461
Russ took him on a canoe,
the Indian Village.

57
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:20,129
Seemed to go all right.

58
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:21,339
Russ...

59
00:06:22,508 --> 00:06:23,800
Russell.

60
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:26,135
Rusty...

61
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:29,681
Am I supposed to ask your permission?

62
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:33,017
I just want to make sure
his intentions are honourable.

63
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:37,814
- Keeping busy?
- Yeah. May be something big.

64
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:43,069
- You don't believe me?
- Oh, I always believed you.

65
00:06:44,113 --> 00:06:45,488
Every time.

66
00:06:47,783 --> 00:06:49,200
Where's Evan?

67
00:06:59,545 --> 00:07:00,753
What's going on?

68
00:07:00,838 --> 00:07:03,965
That actor who shot himself,
the one who plays Superman.

69
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:08,595
- What about him?
- It's made him very upset.

70
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,265
He told you that?

71
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:15,268
Every kid on the block is upset.

72
00:07:18,814 --> 00:07:22,525
Scout. Come on.
Your old pops is taking you to school.

73
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:27,530
What's on your mind, Scout?

74
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:29,032
Nothing.

75
00:07:31,452 --> 00:07:32,702
Nothing?

76
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:34,537
Nothing.

77
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,834
You know, things you see on TV,

78
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:43,463
you know,
someone's a cowboy or a spaceman,

79
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:46,007
it's just pretend, right?

80
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:47,383
I know.

81
00:07:47,426 --> 00:07:50,511
- You remember we talked about that?
- I remember.

82
00:07:51,347 --> 00:07:52,430
Okay.

83
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:58,061
- Hey, what's this?
- I don't know.

84
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:00,063
Well, why don't you find out?

85
00:08:06,779 --> 00:08:09,739
- Do you like that?
- Kind of.

86
00:08:10,491 --> 00:08:12,992
All right, come on, turn the knobs.

87
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:16,097
2:00 in the morning, I'm thinking,
maybe I ain't the best PI in California,

88
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:18,641
but if I catch a one-eyed Negro Jew

89
00:09:18,726 --> 00:09:22,311
sneaking into a house in Beverly Hills,
it's time to pack it in.

90
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:24,981
Davis is a very talented performer.

91
00:09:25,441 --> 00:09:26,858
What'd Rick do?

92
00:09:27,693 --> 00:09:31,320
What's the matter, Ace? Alpha Beta
not hiring any more parking lot guards?

93
00:09:31,447 --> 00:09:33,489
Not with you moonlighting, Chuck.

94
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:37,910
Study this gentleman.
Observe him closely.

95
00:09:38,162 --> 00:09:39,704
The haircut, the getup.

96
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:42,540
Nobody told him the world don't need
two Ralph Meekers.

97
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,876
Listen to him, kid.

98
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,129
And don't start smoking, either.
Filthy habit.

99
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:50,423
This isn't show business, pal.

100
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:53,926
It's just a job. You punch in every day.

101
00:09:55,012 --> 00:09:57,764
- Let's get out of here.
- I'm still eating, Chuck.

102
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:00,641
Come on.

103
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:09,066
Sweetheart, cheque please.

104
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,280
Hey, Del.

105
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:21,120
- Rick working you hard?
- Payroll scam at Warners.

106
00:10:21,205 --> 00:10:25,124
- Well, that's real detective work.
- I'm a real detective.

107
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:29,879
Anything you guys throwing away?

108
00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:32,256
- Jesus, Lou...
- Look, I'm asking.

109
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:34,383
The shit you won't touch, come on.

110
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:35,718
You will?

111
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:39,430
If it puts me in a Fleetwood
bigger than Ricky Harris', yeah.

112
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:42,475
- He drives a Lincoln.
- Come on, Del, feed me something.

113
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,394
- Why should I?
- 'Cause you owe me, partner.

114
00:10:55,531 --> 00:10:56,656
What?

115
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:02,829
What, the guy who used to play
Superman? He shot himself, what?

116
00:11:02,913 --> 00:11:04,914
Someone thinks he didn't.

117
00:11:05,249 --> 00:11:06,916
Oh, yeah? Who?

118
00:11:08,627 --> 00:11:10,920
- His mother.
- His mother.

119
00:11:12,381 --> 00:11:15,758
- How do you know what she thinks?
- She tried to hire us this morning.

120
00:11:17,261 --> 00:11:18,803
What does she have the cops don't?

121
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:21,514
Look, you like a headline,
there's a headline.

122
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:28,896
What did Rick say?

123
00:11:28,939 --> 00:11:33,192
Maybe you forgot, we're paid
to keep things out of the newspaper.

124
00:11:37,573 --> 00:11:40,283
Helen Bessolo. She's in from Illinois.

125
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:43,619
At the Ambassador.
And you don't work for Rick Harris.

126
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:46,414
- What?
- When you pitch her,

127
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:49,125
you're not an associate,
you're not a stringer.

128
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:51,294
Who said I'm pitching her?

129
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:53,337
I'm done eating.

130
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:57,842
Oh, I forgot.

131
00:11:58,594 --> 00:11:59,886
Have one.

132
00:12:01,847 --> 00:12:04,932
- Guess who's a daddy?
- It's a boy.

133
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,162
Mrs Bessolo? I'm Louis Simo.

134
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:27,997
I called.

135
00:12:39,301 --> 00:12:40,968
Our children, yes.

136
00:12:42,721 --> 00:12:44,764
They'll always be our babies.

137
00:12:44,848 --> 00:12:46,807
You work for Mr Harris?

138
00:12:48,477 --> 00:12:52,521
I was an operative at the agency.
I branched out on my own.

139
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:55,316
May I?

140
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,153
Now, there are certain situations

141
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:03,991
the agency is not prepared to handle.

142
00:13:04,493 --> 00:13:06,118
They come to me.

143
00:13:08,664 --> 00:13:10,665
Your house full of strangers.

144
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:13,834
- How's that?
- The ones there, that night.

145
00:13:14,378 --> 00:13:18,172
Van Ronkel, Bliss. And that woman.

146
00:13:18,215 --> 00:13:20,549
This is Lenore? The fiancée?

147
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:22,802
Leonore.

148
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:26,555
How could you trust anything they say?

149
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:32,061
Did he give any indication to you?

150
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:35,731
About what?

151
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:37,650
Being, you know,

152
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:40,528
despondent?

153
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:42,697
Why would he be?

154
00:13:48,245 --> 00:13:53,207
When was, if I may,
the last time you spoke with your son?

155
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:01,924
Do you know a Herbert Spirakis?

156
00:14:03,427 --> 00:14:04,719
No.

157
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:08,472
He's also an investigator here.
Very professional.

158
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:11,350
He says I have a case.

159
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:15,354
Mrs Bessolo, I'm gonna level with you,
all right?

160
00:14:15,439 --> 00:14:19,734
LAPD, Los Angeles Police Department,
they don't like to be shown up.

161
00:14:21,236 --> 00:14:25,114
Okay, they've already closed the door
on your son. It's a suicide. End of story.

162
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:27,074
You want that door open again?

163
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:30,077
You want to make the cops
and the DA pay attention?

164
00:14:31,455 --> 00:14:35,291
You need a headline this big,
only with the truth.

165
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:40,254
So that everybody knows. Okay?
You got to shove it in their faces.

166
00:14:40,297 --> 00:14:42,882
Did Herbert Spirakis tell you that?

167
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:47,636
I have to pay by cheque.

168
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:51,432
Five minutes. I didn't let you in.

169
00:14:56,021 --> 00:14:58,314
Hey. The $20?

170
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:00,816
Right.

171
00:15:02,778 --> 00:15:03,944
Sorry.

172
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:18,834
Say, you know who people
wanted to see? Lana Turner's guy,

173
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:21,754
- Stompanato.
- No kidding.

174
00:15:23,465 --> 00:15:25,007
I tell you, that kid of hers,

175
00:15:25,092 --> 00:15:27,927
the knife was practically
sticking out of his ass.

176
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:30,763
- Think about how hard...
- What are these?

177
00:15:31,098 --> 00:15:32,223
Huh?

178
00:15:33,725 --> 00:15:35,101
These marks?

179
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:39,563
What'd he do,
beat himself up before he shot himself?

180
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:41,148
I don't know.

181
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:50,199
Don't do that. Hey.

182
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:54,203
- I didn't say you could touch anything.
- Don't worry about it.

183
00:15:54,246 --> 00:15:57,164
Put it down, the coroner's
gonna be back. You hear?

184
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,876
Okay, that's it, you gotta go.

185
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:07,174
So, pal, who's T.M.?

186
00:16:10,137 --> 00:16:14,056
Come on, what do you say?
You help me, I'll help you.

187
00:16:15,267 --> 00:16:17,852
George. George.

188
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:19,395
Yes?

189
00:16:19,521 --> 00:16:21,564
Don't order any more drinks,
I can't afford it.

190
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:24,733
We couldn't afford the cover, Nati.
Drinks are just gravy. Hello.

191
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:27,069
Billy Wilder. Hire me, please.

192
00:16:27,112 --> 00:16:28,571
We're two steps from the men's room.

193
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:30,990
Anyone sees us,
they'll think we're queer.

194
00:16:31,074 --> 00:16:32,992
You do look fetching tonight.

195
00:16:33,952 --> 00:16:35,578
- Okay. I'm leaving.
- No, you're not.

196
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:37,288
You're gonna stay right here

197
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:40,040
and wait for the casting guy
from Fox, right there.

198
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:42,501
You and I are going to practise
the fine art of being noticed

199
00:16:42,586 --> 00:16:45,671
without looking like you're trying.
Fred Zinnemann.

200
00:16:47,174 --> 00:16:50,092
- Who?
- He's a director. Pictures.

201
00:16:50,177 --> 00:16:51,510
He hires people.

202
00:16:51,595 --> 00:16:54,054
George, no one's going to
hire me, anyway.

203
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,187
That's Rita Hayworth.

204
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:04,565
George.

205
00:17:07,152 --> 00:17:08,903
That's Rita Hayworth.

206
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:14,408
You look absolutely ravishing, Rita.

207
00:17:17,913 --> 00:17:19,997
- Miss Hayworth!
- This way.

208
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:21,248
Thank you.

209
00:17:23,627 --> 00:17:25,211
Just made it.

210
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:27,755
- I beg your pardon?
- Into the picture.

211
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:30,674
Was someone taking a picture?
I hadn't noticed.

212
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:38,307
- My, we're awfully well-trained. Mr...
- George Reeves.

213
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:41,810
Was it the line or the delivery?

214
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:44,146
- I laugh when I'm happy.
- I see.

215
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:46,482
Who is it that I'm making so happy?

216
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:49,610
- I'm Toni.
- Just a poor girl with no last name.

217
00:17:52,197 --> 00:17:54,198
I had no idea
I could spread this much joy.

218
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:56,951
Well, who knows
what you might be spreading?

219
00:17:58,328 --> 00:18:01,455
- Your turn.
- I'm afraid you got me.

220
00:18:01,665 --> 00:18:03,332
This way, please.

221
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:04,708
Thank you.

222
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:10,339
For you, sir.

223
00:18:13,176 --> 00:18:14,843
Oh, George, George, George...

224
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:22,101
- That was your first picture?
- That was my very first paid acting role.

225
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,145
Your very first paid acting role
was in Gone with the Wind,

226
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,855
- the biggest picture ever?
- That's right.

227
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,357
And yet, I don't remember you.

228
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,359
You don't? How's this?

229
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:33,821
"We want all your waltzes, first Brent,
then me, then Brent, then me..."

230
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:35,489
- You were Tarleton!
- I was.

231
00:18:35,532 --> 00:18:38,325
- Your hair was orange!
- Hardly. It was tangerine.

232
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:39,660
Ah, well.

233
00:18:40,245 --> 00:18:43,872
All right, then. That was your first.
What was your last?

234
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:47,543
- That I'm fairly certain you didn't see.
- Try me.

235
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:51,338
The Adventures of Sir Galahad,
boldest knight of the round table.

236
00:18:51,423 --> 00:18:54,216
Saturday morning serial, very cheap,
we all rode the same horse.

237
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:56,260
Well, I'm sure you
did a wonderful, professional job

238
00:18:56,344 --> 00:18:57,845
and the children loved you.

239
00:18:57,929 --> 00:19:00,931
I don't know, it's a lot of waiting.

240
00:19:01,433 --> 00:19:05,728
A lot of wanting, and somehow,
that's your life.

241
00:19:06,563 --> 00:19:08,897
- How dare you.
- What?

242
00:19:09,024 --> 00:19:11,066
How dare you to permit me
to talk about myself

243
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:14,236
when I'm standing next to
the most beautiful woman?

244
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:16,405
Well, you're an actor.

245
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:23,412
And how about you?
Those friends of yours, over at Ciro's?

246
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:26,206
I know some of them.

247
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:30,085
- Good people to know?
- Not if you know them.

248
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:32,838
Really? That sounded sad.

249
00:19:33,131 --> 00:19:35,883
Not at all. I was aiming for mysterious.

250
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:38,010
Mysterious is like this.

251
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:41,055
Oh, that's good. Do another one.

252
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:44,058
Noble.

253
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,517
Stoic.

254
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:47,478
Heroic.

255
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:49,897
Bad shellfish?

256
00:19:51,316 --> 00:19:53,067
Very good, exactly.

257
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:56,320
Well, you don't seem sad.

258
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:58,197
What if I were?

259
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:01,200
I won't allow it.

260
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,423
I'm much too old for you, you know.

261
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:28,894
- We don't give out that information.
- Here's the thing, though.

262
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:32,689
Mr... The person I work for, he...

263
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:38,445
If I come back empty-handed,
I'll lose my job.

264
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:40,864
"Get me that watch that George had,"
he told me.

265
00:20:40,949 --> 00:20:43,450
- George?
- George Reeves.

266
00:20:43,535 --> 00:20:45,202
Oh, Mr Reeves.

267
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:48,288
Yeah, they were very close.
Like brothers.

268
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:52,000
You know,
they spoke every week, until...

269
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,671
Who do you work for?

270
00:20:57,549 --> 00:21:00,843
No, I can't, I can't.
I just do what I'm told.

271
00:21:01,553 --> 00:21:05,597
If the rest of the world knew
what these stars were really like...

272
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:09,101
Well, we got some stories, right?

273
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:11,353
Hold on.

274
00:21:18,862 --> 00:21:23,866
A gold Chopard Quattro.
Unfortunately, no longer made.

275
00:21:26,995 --> 00:21:29,037
Well, he was a good customer?

276
00:21:29,164 --> 00:21:32,916
No, these are
Mrs Mannix's account. She...

277
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:35,377
She bought him
a lot of things, you know.

278
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:37,379
Of course. Say no more.

279
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:42,301
- Maybe there's some old stock.
- I'd be grateful.

280
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:55,230
No luck, huh?

281
00:21:57,192 --> 00:22:00,819
- I'll go break the bad news.
- If I showed you something else?

282
00:22:00,904 --> 00:22:03,405
No, I don't think that's gonna help.

283
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:06,033
Spencer Tracy.

284
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:11,914
- Now, how the heck did you...
- I'd heard he can be difficult.

285
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:16,001
Oh, between you and me?
Complete prick.

286
00:23:34,455 --> 00:23:35,914
Good morning.

287
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,709
Good morning,

288
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:41,753
Mrs Mannix.

289
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:04,234
I don't have a problem
with a man drinking before breakfast,

290
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:07,029
but it is impolite not to offer me any.

291
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:20,042
Your husband
is the general manager of MGM.

292
00:24:21,628 --> 00:24:25,047
He gives the word, I'm stuck doing
serials for the rest of my life, at best.

293
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:27,758
- He would never do that.
- No? Why not?

294
00:24:30,261 --> 00:24:32,471
Because it would hurt me.

295
00:24:32,555 --> 00:24:35,599
- What about me?
- It would hurt both of us.

296
00:24:39,437 --> 00:24:41,605
Look, whatever I said last night...

297
00:24:41,689 --> 00:24:43,315
It sounded true.

298
00:24:44,525 --> 00:24:47,361
Was it? Or were you acting?

299
00:24:50,323 --> 00:24:51,698
It was true.

300
00:24:54,369 --> 00:24:58,080
Listen, Eddie's got a mistress.

301
00:24:58,206 --> 00:25:00,207
Japanese girl, very sweet.

302
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,252
An apartment in Brentwood,
a cabin up in Big Bear.

303
00:25:04,962 --> 00:25:06,797
And what do you have?

304
00:25:09,676 --> 00:25:14,388
I have another seven good years.
Then my ass drops like a duffel bag.

305
00:25:15,348 --> 00:25:18,934
- Well, it seems all right now.
- Thank you for noticing.

306
00:25:23,231 --> 00:25:26,650
Tell me the truth.
Did you think I could help you?

307
00:25:29,195 --> 00:25:32,948
I thought that you were
the most beautiful girl in the room.

308
00:25:33,908 --> 00:25:35,450
And, yes, I did.

309
00:25:37,995 --> 00:25:40,330
Do you know who you looked like?

310
00:25:40,623 --> 00:25:41,998
Sir Galahad.

311
00:25:46,838 --> 00:25:50,716
George, nobody ever asked
to be happy later.

312
00:25:52,802 --> 00:25:54,720
Tell me what you want.

313
00:25:55,805 --> 00:25:57,389
You can have it.

314
00:26:04,939 --> 00:26:06,481
Should I leave?

315
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:10,277
No. You should stay.

316
00:26:21,581 --> 00:26:23,707
I got a fiancée, I got a mistress...

317
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:26,084
Well, former mistress.
I'm not really sure on that yet,

318
00:26:26,169 --> 00:26:28,795
but I got bruises on the body... What?

319
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:37,471
After you dropped her off,

320
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:40,307
she never left the building, Mr Sinclair.

321
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:43,477
I can't swear that nothing went on
in there, but she never left the building.

322
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:45,854
There's an entrance in the rear.

323
00:26:46,314 --> 00:26:48,732
- Okay.
- And a loading dock.

324
00:26:49,692 --> 00:26:52,861
Neither would be visible
from your vantage point.

325
00:26:56,532 --> 00:27:01,244
Look, Mr Sinclair, maybe,
you know, you and your wife,

326
00:27:01,329 --> 00:27:03,997
you sit down,
you have a conversation and you see...

327
00:27:04,081 --> 00:27:06,333
This man. Here.

328
00:27:06,417 --> 00:27:09,711
- He works there.
- No. I've seen him before.

329
00:27:10,838 --> 00:27:13,799
Mr Simo, I have utter faith
in your abilities,

330
00:27:13,883 --> 00:27:16,218
but you might wish to
entertain the notion

331
00:27:16,344 --> 00:27:18,762
there is more going on
than you realise.

332
00:27:21,682 --> 00:27:23,350
"I, George Bessolo Reeves,

333
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:25,936
"being of sound and disposing
mind and memory,

334
00:27:26,062 --> 00:27:28,271
"do declare this
my last will and testament.

335
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:32,108
"I hereby give, devise and bequeath
all monies and personal property

336
00:27:32,235 --> 00:27:36,947
"owned by me at the time of
my death to Toni Lanier Mannix."

337
00:27:37,031 --> 00:27:38,114
What?

338
00:27:39,784 --> 00:27:42,869
- Maybe there's another will.
- There goddamn better be.

339
00:27:42,954 --> 00:27:44,871
Miss Lemmon,
can I talk to you for a minute?

340
00:27:44,914 --> 00:27:47,833
I'm Louis Simo,
I'm a private investigator.

341
00:27:48,251 --> 00:27:51,211
I've been retained by Helen,
the bereaved mother...

342
00:27:51,254 --> 00:27:53,213
- Bitch!
- I agree.

343
00:27:53,256 --> 00:27:55,423
...of your late fiancé.
I was just wanting to know

344
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:56,591
if I could ask you a couple of questions.

345
00:27:56,717 --> 00:27:58,218
You're not an investigator.

346
00:27:58,261 --> 00:28:01,513
Yes, I am, ma'am. I am licensed
by the State of California...

347
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:03,932
You know what he is? A catfish.

348
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:06,643
Go clean the mud out of your whiskers.

349
00:28:10,773 --> 00:28:12,148
"A catfish"?

350
00:28:19,782 --> 00:28:23,785
- Excuse me. You the Times?
- I'm the Times.

351
00:28:25,246 --> 00:28:26,580
You're the Times?

352
00:28:26,622 --> 00:28:28,999
What do you think about
Superman offing himself

353
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:31,501
and cutting his beloved fiancée
out of the picture?

354
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:35,839
Leaving the green to Eddie Mannix's
wife, huh? Like she needs the dough.

355
00:28:35,965 --> 00:28:37,799
Hell hath no fury, huh?

356
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:40,635
I mean, people get killed
for less than that.

357
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,721
You saying
George Reeves was murdered?

358
00:28:42,805 --> 00:28:45,265
That's a heck of a question.

359
00:28:45,349 --> 00:28:46,516
What's your name?

360
00:28:46,601 --> 00:28:49,936
Louis Simo. S-I-M-O.

361
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:12,042
- Did you go to the doctor?
- I went.

362
00:29:12,168 --> 00:29:16,338
- What did he say?
- Those guys, they're all frauds.

363
00:29:17,381 --> 00:29:19,799
Not a very helpful attitude.

364
00:29:19,884 --> 00:29:22,928
Well, something
has to kill you, don't it?

365
00:29:24,388 --> 00:29:26,097
Oh, I guess so.

366
00:29:26,182 --> 00:29:29,142
- You under contract?
- I was, at Warners.

367
00:29:29,226 --> 00:29:32,437
- But now you're not.
- Now, no, no.

368
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:37,025
- Tough game.
- Well, I'm always ready to play.

369
00:29:42,198 --> 00:29:44,074
George was in
Gone With The Wind, Eddie.

370
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,284
That picture made money.

371
00:29:51,248 --> 00:29:54,250
So, what brought you to Los Angeles,
Miss Yoshida...

372
00:29:54,335 --> 00:29:57,087
- Don't talk to her.
- I'm sorry?

373
00:29:57,755 --> 00:30:00,590
- She doesn't speak English.
- Oh.

374
00:30:00,675 --> 00:30:02,842
Oh, yes.

375
00:30:09,892 --> 00:30:12,894
Eddie, I found a darling little place
up on Benedict.

376
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:17,065
It's about $12,000. I'd like to buy it.

377
00:30:18,484 --> 00:30:19,609
Well,

378
00:30:21,237 --> 00:30:23,446
it's a good investment. Right?

379
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:26,199
Well, you know
what they say about land.

380
00:30:26,283 --> 00:30:28,284
They ain't making more of it.

381
00:30:29,412 --> 00:30:30,787
What's not on the menu?

382
00:30:30,871 --> 00:30:33,581
We have some very nice
blue points set aside, Mr Mannix.

383
00:30:33,666 --> 00:30:36,459
- How's the flank steak?
- The flank steak is very good.

384
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:40,714
Bring me that, Cobb salad,
dressing on the side, baked...

385
00:30:41,716 --> 00:30:43,174
I'm sorry.

386
00:30:45,469 --> 00:30:47,929
My wife will take another Gibson.

387
00:30:51,934 --> 00:30:53,977
Well, what do you think?

388
00:30:54,103 --> 00:30:56,938
The most I ever got from a girlfriend
was a tie.

389
00:30:56,981 --> 00:31:00,692
- Just how Toni does things, I guess.
- You should be happy, George.

390
00:31:00,776 --> 00:31:02,027
Wouldn't mind a job.

391
00:31:02,111 --> 00:31:05,864
Well, maybe she can put in a word.
With her... You know.

392
00:31:05,948 --> 00:31:08,450
Hey, take it.

393
00:31:09,285 --> 00:31:11,661
- What's this?
- It's a couple of hundred.

394
00:31:11,746 --> 00:31:15,498
- I see, but why are you giving it to me?
- Because I got it, you need it.

395
00:31:15,583 --> 00:31:17,709
Go ahead, kid, make your first million.

396
00:31:17,793 --> 00:31:20,628
- Your talent is required.
- All right.

397
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:07,258
"Lois and Jimmy,
what have you done with them?"

398
00:32:07,343 --> 00:32:09,052
"They're safe for now, Superman.

399
00:32:09,136 --> 00:32:11,721
"Just don't get any big ideas
about stopping the robbery."

400
00:32:12,056 --> 00:32:14,099
"All right. You win this time.

401
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:15,809
"But if something happens to them,

402
00:32:16,102 --> 00:32:19,395
"I promise you'll wish
this day never arrived."

403
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:23,358
Whenever you're ready, George.

404
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:25,610
All right.

405
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:29,572
"They're safe for now, Superman.

406
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:33,368
"Just don't get any big ideas
about stopping the robbery."

407
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:36,788
Actually, George,
you're reading the other role.

408
00:32:36,872 --> 00:32:39,749
- Oh, Superman.
- Yeah.

409
00:32:40,584 --> 00:32:43,044
He's, you know, the hero.

410
00:32:43,129 --> 00:32:46,339
I suppose I've always felt
more the criminal type.

411
00:32:46,757 --> 00:32:48,800
We're looking for
a new take here, George.

412
00:32:48,884 --> 00:32:53,304
Someone the kids will buy, sure,
but adults, too. It needs a real actor.

413
00:32:54,223 --> 00:32:57,892
What's the worst that could happen?
We offer you the part.

414
00:33:01,147 --> 00:33:02,814
Well, okay.

415
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:11,322
"All right, Mr Prince, I got
your message. What is it you want?"

416
00:33:11,407 --> 00:33:13,283
"It's not what I want, Superman,
it's what you want."

417
00:33:13,367 --> 00:33:15,952
"Listen. I'm not in the mood for games,

418
00:33:16,036 --> 00:33:17,662
"but I promise you this.

419
00:33:17,746 --> 00:33:19,998
"If anything happens to
Lois or to Jimmy..."

420
00:33:24,837 --> 00:33:29,549
An actor can't always act.
Sometimes he has to work.

421
00:33:29,592 --> 00:33:33,428
You're talking to the man who defended
Camelot with a cardboard sword.

422
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:35,305
I enjoyed you in that.

423
00:33:35,431 --> 00:33:37,932
You were the oldest boy
in the theatre, Art.

424
00:33:37,975 --> 00:33:41,811
Look, it's a dirt-cheap kiddie show.
It doesn't even have a sponsor.

425
00:33:41,896 --> 00:33:45,481
- Odds are no one's ever gonna see it.
- It's just sounding better and better.

426
00:33:45,566 --> 00:33:47,817
And you need the money.

427
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:51,696
- There's money.
- I mean money of your own.

428
00:33:56,035 --> 00:33:57,785
Oh, come on, George.

429
00:33:59,288 --> 00:34:01,122
What do you want from life?

430
00:34:01,165 --> 00:34:04,626
Oh, I don't know.
I'd settle for Clark Gable's career.

431
00:34:05,836 --> 00:34:08,296
Take the job, cash the cheque.

432
00:34:11,467 --> 00:34:13,885
Can I tell you something, Art?
Seriously.

433
00:34:14,136 --> 00:34:15,428
Of course.

434
00:34:15,721 --> 00:34:18,848
You're beautiful
when you take your glasses off.

435
00:34:20,309 --> 00:34:22,769
So, does this mean we're saying yes?

436
00:34:24,605 --> 00:34:28,441
Why is it so drab?
Superman wears blue and red.

437
00:34:28,484 --> 00:34:31,277
Not on TV, not enough contrast.

438
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:34,822
But, maybe if the show flies,
they might film in colour.

439
00:34:34,865 --> 00:34:37,909
For when the colour sets come out.

440
00:34:37,993 --> 00:34:40,745
Then I'll get to wear the blue and red.

441
00:34:50,464 --> 00:34:52,465
I look like a damn fool.

442
00:35:18,409 --> 00:35:21,244
- Nice car.
- That's my baby.

443
00:35:22,246 --> 00:35:23,788
- Lou?
- Yeah.

444
00:35:23,872 --> 00:35:26,374
Hey. I'm Russ Taylor. We're...

445
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:27,625
Yeah, Goofy.

446
00:35:28,544 --> 00:35:31,462
- I'm sorry?
- You went to Disneyland.

447
00:35:31,547 --> 00:35:33,923
Oh, yeah, that's right, last week.

448
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:40,638
She's a little upset. I happened to
be in the neighbourhood, so...

449
00:35:40,848 --> 00:35:42,515
That's convenient.

450
00:35:44,727 --> 00:35:46,519
Hey, he's a good kid.

451
00:35:48,022 --> 00:35:49,856
I saw that right off.

452
00:35:51,066 --> 00:35:54,485
Well, you would know, huh, Russ?

453
00:36:03,912 --> 00:36:06,247
The policy will cover it.
That's not a problem.

454
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:08,750
But she's concerned.

455
00:36:08,792 --> 00:36:12,628
He took charcoal fluid, poured it
all over it and put it on the couch.

456
00:36:12,713 --> 00:36:14,589
Put what on the couch?

457
00:36:23,057 --> 00:36:24,932
What's the deal, Scout?

458
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:37,278
Your mom is very upset with you.

459
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:48,247
What if you
burnt the house down? Huh?

460
00:36:48,999 --> 00:36:51,000
You wouldn't have a place to live.

461
00:36:51,085 --> 00:36:54,879
You know people get killed in fires?
Huh? Use your noggin.

462
00:36:56,632 --> 00:37:00,176
- It was just to get rid of it.
- What, the costume?

463
00:37:01,303 --> 00:37:03,846
Scout, you begged me for that thing.

464
00:37:04,765 --> 00:37:08,643
- You wanted it so bad, you remember?
- Not any more.

465
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:10,144
Why?

466
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:14,524
He shot himself in the head
with a Luger.

467
00:37:15,275 --> 00:37:17,068
That's a Nazi pistol.

468
00:37:25,911 --> 00:37:28,955
So, you know this man?
He was an actor.

469
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:32,375
And if he did shoot... Whatever he did.

470
00:37:33,836 --> 00:37:36,671
You can still
watch him on TV, can't you?

471
00:37:38,298 --> 00:37:40,341
Scout, I asked a question.

472
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:45,763
- Evan, you hear what I'm saying?
- All right.

473
00:37:45,848 --> 00:37:48,307
Evan, you answer when I talk.

474
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:51,686
Evan! Put it down!
Come on, what are you doing?

475
00:37:51,728 --> 00:37:53,563
- Let's leave it.
- Put it down.

476
00:37:53,689 --> 00:37:55,523
- Evan. Put it down!
- Louis!

477
00:37:55,566 --> 00:37:57,692
Stop it, okay, God damn it!

478
00:38:02,573 --> 00:38:03,948
This kid...

479
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:10,121
- Why do you even bother calling me?
- I don't know. Possibly you might care

480
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:12,707
- that your son is having a...
- Maybe you should take a breath.

481
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:15,710
I do care.
I care very much, he's my son.

482
00:38:15,836 --> 00:38:17,462
Just 'cause I don't have
every minute of the day...

483
00:38:17,546 --> 00:38:19,714
No, you have so much going on.

484
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:22,884
Is that what this is? 'Cause I've heard it
already a thousand times from you.

485
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:24,427
The actor. This gimmick you're pulling.

486
00:38:24,553 --> 00:38:26,721
We noticed the item in the paper.

487
00:38:26,847 --> 00:38:28,556
- What? I was hired.
- Can't you see

488
00:38:28,682 --> 00:38:30,725
what these
endless little tricks wind up...

489
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:31,893
This is how I make my fucking living.

490
00:38:31,935 --> 00:38:33,060
Lou, that kind of language...

491
00:38:33,103 --> 00:38:34,770
This is how I make money
that I send you.

492
00:38:34,897 --> 00:38:37,607
- I'm sorry, is this his business?
- I'm just trying to keep things civil.

493
00:38:37,691 --> 00:38:40,651
Russ, this is between Louis and me.

494
00:38:40,736 --> 00:38:44,906
Listen, Lou. He asked for you.
I wasn't gonna call you.

495
00:38:46,742 --> 00:38:48,034
He asked.

496
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:58,044
Well, I'm sorry I couldn't be more help
but, after all, I'm not Superman.

497
00:38:58,086 --> 00:38:59,754
Jeepers, no, Mr Kent.

498
00:38:59,796 --> 00:39:02,423
I suppose that would be
too much to ask.

499
00:39:03,008 --> 00:39:06,093
I suppose it would, Lois.
I suppose it would.

500
00:39:10,098 --> 00:39:11,474
Sorry, that's me.

501
00:39:11,558 --> 00:39:13,267
Keep rolling.
Take it back a line, George.

502
00:39:13,352 --> 00:39:15,102
All right, Tommy. Where were we?

503
00:39:15,187 --> 00:39:18,356
Lois, would you like to see
the real Man of Steel?

504
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,608
Well, sure I would.

505
00:39:20,734 --> 00:39:22,944
All right then, here he is!

506
00:39:23,946 --> 00:39:26,239
You're next, Jimmy!
Leave the bowtie on!

507
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:28,241
Great Caesar's ghost!

508
00:39:28,283 --> 00:39:31,786
More powerful than a locomotive,
Chief! No one is safe!

509
00:39:34,957 --> 00:39:36,666
What did you think?

510
00:39:38,126 --> 00:39:42,129
The scripts are awful.
And everything looks cheap.

511
00:39:43,006 --> 00:39:46,092
- You were charming.
- Well, that's all that matters.

512
00:39:49,638 --> 00:39:51,472
She's a lesbian, you know.

513
00:39:51,557 --> 00:39:53,641
- Who?
- The one playing Lois.

514
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:57,311
- Mr Reeves?
- Hello?

515
00:39:57,437 --> 00:39:59,564
- Whenever you're ready.
- All right.

516
00:39:59,648 --> 00:40:01,983
- Phyllis? Is she really?
- No.

517
00:40:02,985 --> 00:40:05,736
She is now. As far as you're concerned.

518
00:40:07,698 --> 00:40:09,824
Well. There it is.

519
00:40:12,786 --> 00:40:14,036
Cue fans!

520
00:40:16,081 --> 00:40:18,332
Action, George! One!

521
00:40:19,459 --> 00:40:20,501
Two!

522
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:23,337
Three!

523
00:40:36,643 --> 00:40:38,436
Cut it! Cut it!

524
00:40:39,021 --> 00:40:40,354
Unhook him!

525
00:40:42,316 --> 00:40:44,150
- You all right, George?
- Leave him alone.

526
00:40:44,234 --> 00:40:46,444
All right, let him go.
All right, all right.

527
00:40:49,156 --> 00:40:51,741
I'd like to thank the Academy

528
00:40:52,534 --> 00:40:55,578
and all the good people
of Galesburg, Illinois,

529
00:40:55,704 --> 00:40:57,872
for making me who I am today.

530
00:41:00,584 --> 00:41:02,460
Okay, everybody, let's take 10.

531
00:41:02,461 --> 00:41:02,543
Okay, everybody, let's take 10.

532
00:41:26,109 --> 00:41:27,234
Okay.

533
00:41:31,114 --> 00:41:33,908
Who was that next to you
when I came in?

534
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:37,411
Chad. He's in my acting class.

535
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:39,246
Yeah?

536
00:41:41,124 --> 00:41:44,293
- He any good?
- He's okay, I guess.

537
00:41:46,004 --> 00:41:50,007
You shouldn't hang around people
who are less talented than you.

538
00:41:51,593 --> 00:41:53,594
You've never seen me act.

539
00:41:54,763 --> 00:41:55,763
So?

540
00:41:56,807 --> 00:41:59,392
So, you don't know if I'm talented.

541
00:42:02,521 --> 00:42:04,855
You don't know what I could do.

542
00:42:06,983 --> 00:42:09,777
You don't know
a thing about me, do you?

543
00:42:32,634 --> 00:42:34,343
You ever going to tell me
how you got that?

544
00:42:34,469 --> 00:42:36,470
- What?
- Under your armpit.

545
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,892
- Something stupid.
- A fight?

546
00:42:45,063 --> 00:42:48,482
My pop,
he was on the gate at Warners.

547
00:42:48,984 --> 00:42:50,151
A guard?

548
00:42:50,277 --> 00:42:53,654
Yeah, he used to go to work
in this uniform.

549
00:42:53,739 --> 00:42:56,615
You know, crease in the pants
like a knife.

550
00:42:58,326 --> 00:43:01,328
I used to think
he was the Chief of Police.

551
00:43:02,664 --> 00:43:04,331
He... He did that?

552
00:43:06,168 --> 00:43:08,461
I was a month out of the Army.

553
00:43:09,379 --> 00:43:13,716
It was 1946, so no job.
You know, Pop got me set up.

554
00:43:14,676 --> 00:43:19,263
And there was a strike at the studios.
So, keep the union guys off the lot.

555
00:43:20,849 --> 00:43:24,351
You know, platoon around the gate,
me and 40 other saps.

556
00:43:26,188 --> 00:43:29,857
You know, bats and billy clubs.
Got out of hand.

557
00:43:32,194 --> 00:43:35,237
Little Teamster shit
came at me with a razor.

558
00:43:35,322 --> 00:43:38,032
Two years in North Africa,
all I get are crabs.

559
00:43:38,116 --> 00:43:41,827
Six days in Burbank, and... Man.

560
00:43:45,957 --> 00:43:47,875
And my pop apologised.

561
00:43:49,461 --> 00:43:50,711
To you?

562
00:43:53,298 --> 00:43:54,799
To the studio.

563
00:43:56,009 --> 00:43:58,010
For his son screwing up.

564
00:44:00,055 --> 00:44:02,598
Like the chicken-shit peasant he was.

565
00:44:09,815 --> 00:44:12,817
- What's that look?
- I'm just watching you.

566
00:44:18,448 --> 00:44:21,617
- Mrs Bessolo.
- I don't need this.

567
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:24,328
I do. Sit down, please.

568
00:44:24,746 --> 00:44:26,247
Mrs Bessolo.

569
00:44:28,792 --> 00:44:30,167
Right here.

570
00:44:31,336 --> 00:44:32,920
- Mrs Bessolo.
- Mrs Bessolo.

571
00:44:33,004 --> 00:44:35,339
I'm James Engelmann,
from RKO-Pathe Studios.

572
00:44:35,423 --> 00:44:37,883
- The what?
- Superman was filmed on our lot.

573
00:44:37,968 --> 00:44:41,929
And I'm here to express
how saddened we are over your loss.

574
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:45,724
My son was not lost, Mr Engelmann.
He was taken.

575
00:44:46,268 --> 00:44:49,353
- One more, Mrs Bessolo.
- Over here, Mrs Bessolo.

576
00:44:51,231 --> 00:44:53,399
What the hell
did you drag them here for?

577
00:44:53,441 --> 00:44:55,442
Freedom of the press, right?

578
00:45:09,165 --> 00:45:12,501
- These in the report?
- They weren't there then.

579
00:45:14,921 --> 00:45:18,465
Hang on there, Mrs Bessolo, hang on,
hang on. Come on.

580
00:45:19,551 --> 00:45:22,136
- Just let me sit for a minute.
- Okay.

581
00:45:22,262 --> 00:45:23,929
Come on, make yourself useful,
grab a chair.

582
00:45:23,972 --> 00:45:26,932
- Sure.
- Come on, let's get her out of here.

583
00:45:26,975 --> 00:45:28,475
There you go.

584
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:31,020
There you go.

585
00:45:33,523 --> 00:45:37,985
Okay? There you go, very good.
Okay, good.

586
00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:39,361
Here.

587
00:45:40,363 --> 00:45:44,116
Okay? I'm gonna go handle this.
You just relax.

588
00:45:45,827 --> 00:45:49,455
- Is she all right?
- That's her boy's blood. You tell me.

589
00:45:52,751 --> 00:45:55,002
The deceased woke up,

590
00:45:55,086 --> 00:45:57,504
joined his guests
for approximately half an hour,

591
00:45:57,631 --> 00:46:01,884
returned to bed, no sign of forced entry
or physical struggle.

592
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:06,388
The Luger, found there on the floor,
heavily oiled. No prints.

593
00:46:07,057 --> 00:46:09,224
He kept it in the nightstand.

594
00:46:09,559 --> 00:46:12,311
The slug, there.

595
00:46:13,438 --> 00:46:16,982
And the casing, on the bed,
underneath the body.

596
00:46:17,067 --> 00:46:20,194
You want to explain to me
how a man can shoot himself

597
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:21,862
and end up on top of the shell?

598
00:46:21,988 --> 00:46:24,531
Is this your strategy, Mr Simo?
To impugn the laws of physics?

599
00:46:24,658 --> 00:46:26,116
There's no prints on the gun.

600
00:46:26,201 --> 00:46:28,494
What, did he wipe it clean
after putting that hole in his head?

601
00:46:28,536 --> 00:46:31,330
Prints aren't automatic.
Certain conditions have to be present.

602
00:46:31,373 --> 00:46:32,915
Did you question the people
in the house?

603
00:46:33,041 --> 00:46:34,249
They all signed sworn statements.

604
00:46:34,376 --> 00:46:36,085
Forty-five minutes to call the cops.

605
00:46:36,169 --> 00:46:38,629
That's plenty of time to come up
with some bogus story.

606
00:46:38,713 --> 00:46:41,215
- But you got sworn statements.
- You accusing me of something?

607
00:46:41,299 --> 00:46:43,050
Was Reeves
checked for powder burns?

608
00:46:43,134 --> 00:46:45,344
It's a suicide shot to the temple.
Where's the burn?

609
00:46:45,428 --> 00:46:47,388
When a gun is discharged
directly against...

610
00:46:47,472 --> 00:46:49,014
Listen, the coroner never checked.

611
00:46:49,099 --> 00:46:50,849
He didn't notice
the bruises on the body, either.

612
00:46:50,934 --> 00:46:53,727
Which, by the way,
aren't automatic, okay?

613
00:46:53,812 --> 00:46:56,063
Certain conditions have to be present.

614
00:46:56,147 --> 00:46:58,941
Like, maybe a fight with a guy
that's about to...

615
00:47:00,944 --> 00:47:02,903
Cause your expiration.

616
00:47:17,585 --> 00:47:20,170
He won't be buried in that cape.

617
00:47:20,255 --> 00:47:23,340
Mrs Bessolo,
RKO-Pathe would be honoured

618
00:47:23,425 --> 00:47:26,677
to help you pay
for any sort of a floral tribute

619
00:47:26,761 --> 00:47:29,388
that you might deem
appropriate for your son.

620
00:47:35,937 --> 00:47:39,773
Since when do suicides miss twice,
lay down a rug and start over?

621
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:43,527
Is that normal? Just asking.

622
00:47:45,113 --> 00:47:48,741
That cost the studio 15 grand.

623
00:47:49,242 --> 00:47:51,201
You think you're worth that?

624
00:47:51,286 --> 00:47:52,327
We were just...

625
00:47:52,412 --> 00:47:55,122
This Farmer's Daughter picture.
What is it?

626
00:47:56,458 --> 00:47:59,793
- The Mating Game.
- A $1 million investment.

627
00:47:59,878 --> 00:48:02,129
You think I'm going to
let you fuck with that?

628
00:48:02,213 --> 00:48:03,714
You think you're gonna be a star?

629
00:48:03,798 --> 00:48:06,300
- Our concern here is...
- You're a face.

630
00:48:06,426 --> 00:48:08,761
- Faces change.
- What Mr Mannix means...

631
00:48:08,803 --> 00:48:11,972
He knows what I mean.
Out of my sight.

632
00:48:20,732 --> 00:48:22,399
Set something up.

633
00:48:23,026 --> 00:48:26,361
Him and some starlet.

634
00:48:28,073 --> 00:48:31,158
Picnic, soda pop.

635
00:48:31,242 --> 00:48:32,576
Already arranged.

636
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:35,579
They treat their contract
like shit, Howard.

637
00:48:37,415 --> 00:48:39,583
Whatever the fuck they want.

638
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,003
The business is changing.

639
00:48:44,297 --> 00:48:46,048
Fags and television.

640
00:48:48,843 --> 00:48:50,677
And what are we, huh?

641
00:48:51,805 --> 00:48:53,847
The Last of the Mohicans.

642
00:48:55,391 --> 00:48:57,601
That was a UA picture, Eddie.

643
00:49:00,105 --> 00:49:02,606
That spic,

644
00:49:03,942 --> 00:49:06,777
wop, prick detective.

645
00:49:06,861 --> 00:49:09,863
I sent Jim Engelmann over.
He used to work for us.

646
00:49:09,948 --> 00:49:12,032
I'm sure you don't want
MGM coming into it.

647
00:49:12,158 --> 00:49:14,618
- And?
- Louis Simo.

648
00:49:15,453 --> 00:49:17,287
Two years with Rick Harris.

649
00:49:17,372 --> 00:49:19,373
He shot his mouth off
about Susan Humphries

650
00:49:19,415 --> 00:49:22,584
to Confidential for $5,000.
Harris fired him.

651
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:25,420
- Susan Humphries?
- Jennifer Jones type.

652
00:49:25,547 --> 00:49:28,132
Under contract at Fox. Heroin addict.

653
00:49:28,883 --> 00:49:32,678
- Drove off Topanga doing 90.
- You have a good memory, Eddie.

654
00:49:33,888 --> 00:49:37,891
- What's the prick want?
- Money. Press. Whatever he can grab.

655
00:49:39,894 --> 00:49:43,272
- What's he got?
- Some questions.

656
00:49:58,746 --> 00:50:00,956
My wife won't get out of bed.

657
00:50:02,417 --> 00:50:05,669
It's been almost a week,
she won't get out.

658
00:50:05,753 --> 00:50:09,631
- I'll stop by and see her.
- Do that. Cheer her up.

659
00:50:10,592 --> 00:50:12,384
She always liked you.

660
00:50:14,679 --> 00:50:17,055
- Eddie.
- Yeah?

661
00:50:17,682 --> 00:50:20,851
- You have anything to tell me?
- About what?

662
00:50:20,935 --> 00:50:24,771
Anything I need to
have a story ready for.

663
00:50:34,616 --> 00:50:37,117
- She's not here.
- Miss Lemmon?

664
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:39,828
- That's interesting.
- What is?

665
00:50:40,288 --> 00:50:44,458
That you thought I wanted to
talk to her, since this is your house.

666
00:50:51,841 --> 00:50:53,675
Is that your father?

667
00:50:55,053 --> 00:50:57,221
- My husband.
- Oh, sorry.

668
00:50:59,307 --> 00:51:01,141
He's a screenwriter.

669
00:51:02,101 --> 00:51:03,936
Well, no one could blame you
for wanting to hang around

670
00:51:03,978 --> 00:51:06,146
people your own age.

671
00:51:06,189 --> 00:51:09,316
What was his name again?
Robert Condon?

672
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:10,817
I'm sure you're just friends.

673
00:51:13,488 --> 00:51:14,863
Around back.

674
00:51:27,293 --> 00:51:29,670
You really ought to prune these.

675
00:51:30,421 --> 00:51:34,508
My husband does the gardening.
It takes his mind off his writing.

676
00:51:35,343 --> 00:51:38,345
Well, what do you do,
Mrs Van Ronkel?

677
00:51:39,806 --> 00:51:42,140
I don't go around
trying to get my picture in the paper.

678
00:51:42,183 --> 00:51:44,059
You saw that, huh?

679
00:51:44,185 --> 00:51:47,729
What are you going to do
when this blows up in your face?

680
00:51:48,564 --> 00:51:50,691
There are two holes
in the bedroom floor.

681
00:51:50,775 --> 00:51:52,567
What do you know about that?

682
00:51:52,694 --> 00:51:54,194
- Leonore made them.
- Yeah?

683
00:51:54,279 --> 00:51:56,280
- Months ago.
- Why?

684
00:51:56,948 --> 00:51:58,240
I asked her to.

685
00:51:58,366 --> 00:52:01,034
You asked her
to shoot a gun in the floor.

686
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:03,787
When you're drunk, everything's funny.

687
00:52:06,124 --> 00:52:09,293
He shoots himself, you all wait
45 minutes to call the police.

688
00:52:09,377 --> 00:52:10,877
That's unusual.

689
00:52:11,421 --> 00:52:14,631
You ever been to a party where a man
goes upstairs and blows his head off?

690
00:52:14,716 --> 00:52:15,799
No.

691
00:52:15,883 --> 00:52:17,759
Then how do you know
what's unusual?

692
00:52:20,555 --> 00:52:24,349
- So how do I find Miss Lemmon?
- She's not the way you think she is.

693
00:52:24,392 --> 00:52:26,977
Yeah? What way is she?

694
00:52:28,730 --> 00:52:30,981
She was only looking for love.

695
00:52:33,568 --> 00:52:36,611
I just want to remember that one.
That's good.

696
00:52:41,826 --> 00:52:44,911
That's nice, it's very futuristic.

697
00:52:46,331 --> 00:52:49,291
- Hey, you're a detective, right?
- Yeah.

698
00:52:50,001 --> 00:52:54,087
So, men hire you to find out what
their wives are up to, that sort of thing?

699
00:52:54,213 --> 00:52:55,922
Yeah, they do that.

700
00:52:56,007 --> 00:52:58,425
Does the truth make them happier?

701
00:52:59,969 --> 00:53:01,428
Hardly ever.

702
00:53:04,307 --> 00:53:07,100
You know,
he wasn't going to marry her.

703
00:53:08,853 --> 00:53:10,103
Reeves?

704
00:53:10,605 --> 00:53:11,688
How do you know?

705
00:53:11,773 --> 00:53:14,483
Oh, she ran over here
when he told her.

706
00:53:15,485 --> 00:53:17,235
I heard every word.

707
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:21,531
And how did Miss Lemmon react?

708
00:53:23,368 --> 00:53:26,578
Like a longshoreman on a bender.

709
00:54:07,245 --> 00:54:08,412
- Christ!
- Fuck you.

710
00:54:08,496 --> 00:54:11,123
Nobody wants to hear
your mopey singing.

711
00:54:11,165 --> 00:54:12,833
This is my house.

712
00:54:12,875 --> 00:54:15,460
I'm tired of you treating it
like a goddamn bus station.

713
00:54:15,503 --> 00:54:17,212
Woe is fucking me.

714
00:54:22,427 --> 00:54:24,719
You goddamn miserable son of a bitch.

715
00:54:24,804 --> 00:54:26,596
- Christ!
- Don't you walk away from me.

716
00:54:26,681 --> 00:54:27,889
Shut up!

717
00:54:27,974 --> 00:54:30,016
I haul myself out
to this shithole burg for you,

718
00:54:30,101 --> 00:54:32,144
and you have the balls
to tell me it's off?

719
00:54:32,228 --> 00:54:36,273
God damn it.
Listen, what are you doing?

720
00:54:36,357 --> 00:54:39,192
- Put that...
- I'm the fucking man in this room!

721
00:54:39,277 --> 00:54:41,194
- You're a fool!
- Do something, all right?

722
00:54:41,279 --> 00:54:44,281
- You has-been! You sad old drunk!
- Give it to me! God damn it!

723
00:54:50,913 --> 00:54:52,205
Georgie?

724
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:24,589
I had to take a leak.
What's your excuse?

725
00:56:24,674 --> 00:56:26,383
This is a sealed crime scene.

726
00:56:26,926 --> 00:56:30,470
Then I guess we both deserve
to get our bottoms spanked.

727
00:56:38,646 --> 00:56:39,688
What's that?

728
00:56:39,814 --> 00:56:43,400
Last I looked, it was $4,000
in traveller's cheques.

729
00:56:44,694 --> 00:56:47,404
Georgie put it aside
for our honeymoon.

730
00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:51,199
- That's off the plate now, isn't it?
- Is that why you killed him?

731
00:56:51,325 --> 00:56:55,912
You think he was rich?
That Superman gig paid shit.

732
00:56:55,997 --> 00:56:59,666
Oh, yeah? Well, maybe you found out
a little too late.

733
00:57:03,504 --> 00:57:08,466
He was fun, knocked back the booze
like nobody's business.

734
00:57:09,927 --> 00:57:12,971
Pretty good in the sack. Yeah.

735
00:57:13,514 --> 00:57:14,639
Yeah?

736
00:57:16,017 --> 00:57:18,685
Lady, I can nail you with this.

737
00:57:18,728 --> 00:57:23,565
D'Artagnan, you couldn't nail me
with roses and a trip to Vegas.

738
00:57:24,692 --> 00:57:26,526
And you're not a cop.

739
00:57:27,737 --> 00:57:29,362
So what the hell are you doing
following me

740
00:57:29,447 --> 00:57:31,448
into my dead fiancé's bedroom?

741
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:37,287
"And then, Mr Simo showed me
his member, Your Honour.

742
00:57:38,664 --> 00:57:40,707
"And I became frightened."

743
00:57:43,961 --> 00:57:45,629
You're in my way.

744
00:57:48,382 --> 00:57:52,886
- I'm going to be on you, Miss Lemmon.
- Not unless you dope me first.

745
00:58:00,728 --> 00:58:03,730
See how I got us in the paper?
Look at this.

746
00:58:06,651 --> 00:58:09,694
Guaranteed, LAPD
is going to sweat this.

747
00:58:09,779 --> 00:58:11,905
Now, the more heat they feel,

748
00:58:11,989 --> 00:58:13,698
the more pressure they're under
to reopen the case.

749
00:58:13,783 --> 00:58:16,910
- The police reopened the case?
- No.

750
00:58:16,994 --> 00:58:18,912
They will if I keep it up.

751
00:58:18,996 --> 00:58:21,498
Which requires a financial commitment
from you

752
00:58:21,582 --> 00:58:23,583
so I can go on hammering.

753
00:58:27,213 --> 00:58:30,090
I did get a copy of the police report.
Lots of holes.

754
00:58:30,216 --> 00:58:32,592
And I'm not talking about the ones
in the floor.

755
00:58:32,635 --> 00:58:36,096
Plus, something else.
Your son called the wedding off.

756
00:58:36,347 --> 00:58:38,515
That's a new motive
for Miss Lemmon, okay?

757
00:58:38,599 --> 00:58:42,268
- And I intend to go...
- She was never going to be his wife.

758
00:58:42,937 --> 00:58:44,646
Oh, yeah? You knew that
he didn't plan on...

759
00:58:44,730 --> 00:58:47,899
Do you think my own son
would get married without telling me?

760
00:58:47,983 --> 00:58:50,276
And to a greedy slut like that?

761
00:58:55,866 --> 00:58:57,617
All these people...

762
00:59:01,622 --> 00:59:02,789
What about them?

763
00:59:02,915 --> 00:59:05,625
They're sitting around
like they're so big.

764
00:59:06,252 --> 00:59:08,294
I don't know who they are.

765
00:59:10,172 --> 00:59:14,300
George starred with
Sinatra, with Gable.

766
00:59:15,052 --> 00:59:17,345
He was an important film actor.

767
00:59:27,273 --> 00:59:31,609
- Someone else can do that, you know.
- Well, now, it's a beautiful car.

768
00:59:31,694 --> 00:59:33,486
Ought to keep it clean.

769
00:59:33,571 --> 00:59:37,031
Why? Does this offend
your delicate sensibilities?

770
00:59:37,158 --> 00:59:40,660
Yes. But you're new on the job,
so I'll let it pass.

771
00:59:44,832 --> 00:59:48,418
Art got a call.
They're picking up Superman.

772
00:59:49,170 --> 00:59:50,670
They're what?

773
00:59:51,338 --> 00:59:53,339
Kellogg's. They bought it.

774
00:59:53,424 --> 00:59:56,134
- After two years?
- That's right.

775
00:59:56,218 --> 00:59:58,720
I will be on television in a month.

776
00:59:59,638 --> 01:00:02,098
Wearing brown and grey underpants.

777
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:03,725
Well?

778
01:00:04,852 --> 01:00:06,811
- Hooray!
- Christ.

779
01:00:08,439 --> 01:00:10,231
Well, maybe it wasn't
your proudest moment.

780
01:00:10,357 --> 01:00:12,192
No, I'm quite sure it wasn't.

781
01:00:12,234 --> 01:00:17,697
But you did create a very likeable,
very attractive, very heroic character.

782
01:00:17,740 --> 01:00:19,199
Is that right?

783
01:00:20,451 --> 01:00:22,452
I'd fuck you in a second.

784
01:00:23,454 --> 01:00:25,872
Well, one thing we can be sure of.

785
01:00:25,956 --> 01:00:28,792
No one with a lick of sense
would watch that show.

786
01:00:37,802 --> 01:00:40,053
Faster than a speeding bullet.

787
01:00:40,679 --> 01:00:43,056
More powerful than a locomotive.

788
01:00:44,016 --> 01:00:46,935
Able to leap tall buildings
in a single bound.

789
01:00:47,061 --> 01:00:48,436
- Look!
- Up in the sky!

790
01:00:48,562 --> 01:00:49,896
- It's a bird!
- It's a plane!

791
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:51,272
It's Superman!

792
01:00:51,398 --> 01:00:52,816
Yes, it's Superman!

793
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:54,442
Strange visitor from another planet

794
01:00:54,568 --> 01:00:56,778
who can change the course
of mighty rivers,

795
01:00:56,904 --> 01:00:59,113
bend steel in his bare hands,

796
01:00:59,198 --> 01:01:02,951
and who, disguised as Clark Kent,
fights a never-ending battle

797
01:01:03,035 --> 01:01:06,371
for truth, justice,
and the American way!

798
01:01:08,123 --> 01:01:11,918
"Homes with children.
Adventures of Superman,

799
01:01:12,670 --> 01:01:14,921
"91 rating."

800
01:01:15,339 --> 01:01:17,423
What does that mean?
No adults are watching?

801
01:01:17,508 --> 01:01:20,927
No, they're watching
with the kids, George. Families.

802
01:01:21,428 --> 01:01:25,098
Kellogg's has ordered 26 more.
They want to film in colour.

803
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:28,476
Well, I'll get to wear the blue and red.

804
01:01:34,191 --> 01:01:37,277
- Maybe you ought to put that out.
- What for?

805
01:01:44,618 --> 01:01:46,494
Superman doesn't smoke.

806
01:01:54,795 --> 01:01:56,421
- Sir.
- Thank you.

807
01:02:11,353 --> 01:02:15,940
Art, I'm coming right back.
Keep your mitts off my grub.

808
01:02:17,526 --> 01:02:18,902
All right.

809
01:02:38,714 --> 01:02:40,214
George Reeves?

810
01:02:49,725 --> 01:02:51,726
Excuse me, Mr Zinnemann.

811
01:02:52,186 --> 01:02:55,855
George Reeves will be reading
for the role of Maylon Stark.

812
01:02:57,024 --> 01:02:59,025
Good morning, one and all.

813
01:03:00,653 --> 01:03:02,779
Superman was on pain pills.

814
01:03:05,574 --> 01:03:08,284
So he crashed his car
a couple of months back.

815
01:03:08,369 --> 01:03:10,870
- Almost got killed.
- Drunk?

816
01:03:10,955 --> 01:03:14,791
- There wasn't any brake fluid.
- How do you know that?

817
01:03:15,876 --> 01:03:19,295
I went down to the Esso station
at the bottom of Benedict.

818
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:23,424
I said I was from the insurance
company. I spoke to a Mr Phelps.

819
01:03:23,509 --> 01:03:26,636
- He was very friendly.
- Leak in the lining?

820
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:30,640
Mr Phelps couldn't find one.
Not bad, huh?

821
01:03:30,724 --> 01:03:34,352
But they were still getting married,
at least then, as far as she knew.

822
01:03:34,395 --> 01:03:36,729
Well, wouldn't that be why?

823
01:03:36,855 --> 01:03:41,234
- Why Leonore drains his brake fluid?
- Why Mrs Mannix does.

824
01:03:41,276 --> 01:03:43,820
He leaves her, right?
For this younger woman.

825
01:03:43,904 --> 01:03:46,990
- She can't bear it...
- And Toni wants him dead.

826
01:03:47,866 --> 01:03:50,118
Well, wouldn't that be better?

827
01:03:52,413 --> 01:03:55,331
Help! Help!
They've robbed the Docville Bank!

828
01:04:09,221 --> 01:04:10,596
Superman!

829
01:04:14,601 --> 01:04:16,144
Stop right there!

830
01:04:18,022 --> 01:04:20,648
What's that? Someone's in need.

831
01:04:31,493 --> 01:04:33,828
You can't see my penis, can you?

832
01:05:21,835 --> 01:05:25,505
Hey, Superman! Hey, Superman!

833
01:05:25,881 --> 01:05:28,174
Well, hello there, young man,
what's your name?

834
01:05:28,258 --> 01:05:31,844
Kenneth Giles. Can I shoot you?

835
01:05:42,898 --> 01:05:46,859
Kenneth, why would you want
to do something like that?

836
01:05:47,194 --> 01:05:49,779
So the bullet bounces off. Can I?

837
01:05:52,449 --> 01:05:57,870
Well, if you did shoot me
and the bullet bounced off,

838
01:05:57,913 --> 01:06:00,623
it might accidentally hit someone else.

839
01:06:01,083 --> 01:06:03,918
- We don't want that to happen, do we?
- No.

840
01:06:05,712 --> 01:06:09,966
Why don't you just, you and I...
Here we go, partner.

841
01:06:10,467 --> 01:06:13,928
Why don't you just give me that?
Just hand me that...

842
01:06:14,012 --> 01:06:15,471
One minute...

843
01:06:17,307 --> 01:06:20,059
You think
I don't see what you're doing?

844
01:06:20,185 --> 01:06:22,979
- I'm sorry?
- Day after day, taking pictures.

845
01:06:23,063 --> 01:06:25,064
I'm just waiting for the traffic.

846
01:06:25,149 --> 01:06:27,191
He leaves those where I can see them.

847
01:06:27,234 --> 01:06:31,028
And then he pretends
he doesn't know what I'm talking about.

848
01:06:31,655 --> 01:06:34,490
- Miss Sinclair...
- What is he paying you?

849
01:06:34,575 --> 01:06:35,783
That's confidential.

850
01:06:35,868 --> 01:06:38,369
He's been out of work
for seven months.

851
01:06:38,453 --> 01:06:41,289
I don't know what he does all day.
He won't tell me.

852
01:06:41,373 --> 01:06:43,875
Now, why don't you investigate that?

853
01:06:45,752 --> 01:06:50,089
Ma'am, I'm just trying
to turn a buck here, that's all.

854
01:06:50,174 --> 01:06:51,757
If there's a problem between you two,

855
01:06:51,884 --> 01:06:55,386
maybe you should talk to a priest
or whatever.

856
01:06:55,429 --> 01:06:56,846
Hash it out.

857
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:02,560
I can't fix your marriage, ma'am.

858
01:07:05,939 --> 01:07:08,107
I don't know,
I thought you might put in a word.

859
01:07:08,192 --> 01:07:10,943
- What do you suggest I say?
- He drops a hint to Zinnemann.

860
01:07:11,028 --> 01:07:12,486
That's how
these things work, you know.

861
01:07:12,571 --> 01:07:14,780
It was a very solid audition.

862
01:07:14,865 --> 01:07:17,867
It's Harry Cohn's picture.
Eddie's at MGM.

863
01:07:17,951 --> 01:07:21,162
Well, what ever happened to honour
among thieves?

864
01:07:21,246 --> 01:07:23,414
Let's just save it
for something important.

865
01:07:23,498 --> 01:07:26,542
Oh, I see.
This isn't important at all. Wow.

866
01:07:32,799 --> 01:07:33,925
Here.

867
01:07:34,968 --> 01:07:37,303
Because you've had a rough week.

868
01:07:40,974 --> 01:07:44,227
Well, who needs another watch?

869
01:07:45,062 --> 01:07:48,147
I just don't want some drunk finishing
what that horrid child started.

870
01:07:48,232 --> 01:07:49,732
I don't know that a gun is the answer.

871
01:07:49,816 --> 01:07:51,651
It would just make me feel
more comfortable knowing...

872
01:07:51,735 --> 01:07:54,445
What would make me feel safe
is not prancing around in a monkey suit

873
01:07:54,529 --> 01:07:56,405
in front of 8,000 screaming...

874
01:07:56,490 --> 01:07:59,659
You'd be gone, George, all right?

875
01:07:59,785 --> 01:08:01,911
And then what happens to me?

876
01:08:10,671 --> 01:08:12,171
Mrs Mannix, please.

877
01:08:12,297 --> 01:08:13,839
Who shall I say is calling?

878
01:08:13,966 --> 01:08:17,218
Lawrence Farmer,
from the St. Jude's Foundation.

879
01:08:17,344 --> 01:08:20,763
- To thank her for her generosity.
- One moment, please.

880
01:08:47,499 --> 01:08:48,708
Mr Simo.

881
01:08:53,547 --> 01:08:55,464
- Do I know you?
- No.

882
01:08:56,550 --> 01:08:58,134
But I'm familiar with you.

883
01:08:58,218 --> 01:09:00,553
Everybody reads the Times, huh?

884
01:09:01,638 --> 01:09:04,932
I'm Howard Strickling.
I handle publicity at MGM.

885
01:09:05,017 --> 01:09:06,309
How do you do?

886
01:09:06,393 --> 01:09:08,394
And I'm wondering
why you would be trying

887
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:11,022
to approach Mrs Mannix
under false pretences.

888
01:09:11,064 --> 01:09:12,565
Are you speaking professionally?

889
01:09:12,691 --> 01:09:15,067
I'm speaking
as a friend of the Mannixs.

890
01:09:15,110 --> 01:09:18,029
- Can I see Mrs Mannix?
- She's not well.

891
01:09:18,071 --> 01:09:19,613
And frankly,
neither she nor her husband

892
01:09:19,740 --> 01:09:21,574
appreciate being dragged
into this business.

893
01:09:21,616 --> 01:09:24,785
- What business is that?
- Your business, Mr Simo.

894
01:09:30,417 --> 01:09:32,126
You didn't have to go and do that.

895
01:09:32,210 --> 01:09:35,463
You seem to have an inflated sense
of your importance.

896
01:09:35,547 --> 01:09:37,631
They're on routine patrol.

897
01:09:48,143 --> 01:09:52,146
Could you pass along a message
to Mrs Mannix?

898
01:09:52,272 --> 01:09:54,148
And what would that be?

899
01:09:56,485 --> 01:09:58,819
Hope to see her at the funeral.

900
01:10:14,586 --> 01:10:19,090
Art! Where's the boy?
I've been hunting all over.

901
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:21,467
He's over there.

902
01:10:22,636 --> 01:10:25,763
Zinnemann sure did keep us hanging
long enough.

903
01:10:25,806 --> 01:10:28,015
But I knew it would pan out.

904
01:10:28,141 --> 01:10:31,227
- How did you know that?
- What choice did I have?

905
01:10:33,313 --> 01:10:36,816
And, Toni, thank you.

906
01:10:37,150 --> 01:10:38,401
For what?

907
01:10:39,736 --> 01:10:42,363
Whatever you did to help.

908
01:10:42,864 --> 01:10:45,324
You know how much he needed this.

909
01:10:49,663 --> 01:10:51,455
Hi, George.

910
01:10:51,498 --> 01:10:53,833
- Hello.
- Hi.

911
01:11:01,842 --> 01:11:05,761
Mr Weissman?
I don't want to disturb you, but I...

912
01:11:05,846 --> 01:11:08,848
- You knew George?
- No.

913
01:11:10,183 --> 01:11:13,436
- I'm Louis Simo. I'm a...
- I'm no speechmaker.

914
01:11:14,271 --> 01:11:17,898
Saying what you really feel, it's hard.

915
01:11:19,568 --> 01:11:21,360
Thank you for coming.

916
01:11:22,696 --> 01:11:25,698
Mr Weissman,
I was just wondering if you...

917
01:11:29,035 --> 01:11:31,203
Seeing me off the grounds again?

918
01:11:31,246 --> 01:11:33,164
Mrs Mannix was unable to attend.

919
01:11:33,206 --> 01:11:35,749
For reasons
I'm sure you can understand.

920
01:11:35,876 --> 01:11:38,085
You do a lot for your friends.

921
01:11:40,547 --> 01:11:44,216
And you're just doing your job.
But I am concerned.

922
01:11:44,468 --> 01:11:46,844
- Yeah? About what?
- Your history.

923
01:11:46,928 --> 01:11:50,473
People are rarely afforded the chance
to make the same mistake twice.

924
01:11:50,557 --> 01:11:53,601
- Are you threatening me?
- I'm offering you an opportunity.

925
01:11:54,394 --> 01:11:57,897
There's a place for you at Metro
if you'd like. The pay can be generous.

926
01:11:58,023 --> 01:12:00,816
- I'd rather talk to Mrs Mannix.
- There's nothing there for you.

927
01:12:00,901 --> 01:12:03,611
Yeah? Then why are you pitching me?

928
01:12:03,737 --> 01:12:08,073
When it comes to publicity, what's
true or false really doesn't matter.

929
01:12:08,116 --> 01:12:12,286
If it hurts the studio, if it stops
one person from buying a ticket,

930
01:12:12,412 --> 01:12:15,331
I have to fix it. That's my job.

931
01:12:16,666 --> 01:12:18,459
The offer's sincere.

932
01:12:18,585 --> 01:12:22,087
Don't let pride stand in the way.
It won't get you what you want.

933
01:12:25,050 --> 01:12:28,552
Sad day, huh, boys?
Tell you what's sadder.

934
01:12:28,595 --> 01:12:31,347
Calling it suicide
when it's really murder.

935
01:12:31,431 --> 01:12:32,932
Now why would the cops do that?

936
01:12:33,016 --> 01:12:36,769
- Sing us a new song, Simo.
- What, you don't love me any more?

937
01:12:37,270 --> 01:12:38,771
Two months ago, somebody drained

938
01:12:38,897 --> 01:12:41,440
all the fluid
out of George Reeves' brake line.

939
01:12:41,483 --> 01:12:44,610
Almost bought it right then.
Coincidence, right?

940
01:12:45,445 --> 01:12:48,656
I mean, LAPD don't make mistakes.
Huh, Paterson?

941
01:12:48,782 --> 01:12:50,950
What's the truth, huh, boys?

942
01:12:50,992 --> 01:12:52,451
Who wanted him dead?

943
01:12:52,536 --> 01:12:54,328
You guys might be lazy,
but nobody said you're dumb.

944
01:12:54,412 --> 01:12:56,705
- Give me that.
- Name some names.

945
01:12:56,790 --> 01:12:59,667
- You want me to write it for you, too?
- Hey, you got a story or not?

946
01:12:59,751 --> 01:13:02,628
You want names? Ask this guy.

947
01:13:03,296 --> 01:13:06,632
He's got the names.
The names, pictures.

948
01:13:06,758 --> 01:13:09,969
What's he doing here when MGM
never cut Reeves a cheque in his life?

949
01:13:10,053 --> 01:13:12,304
Huh? Come on,
do some work, will you?

950
01:13:12,430 --> 01:13:15,015
Hey, Capa,
lift the fucking camera, will you.

951
01:13:16,977 --> 01:13:19,144
There you go. Say, "Cheese."

952
01:13:29,948 --> 01:13:31,574
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

953
01:13:31,658 --> 01:13:35,286
- Hi, Bobby.
- Hi, Bobby. Good to see you.

954
01:13:35,328 --> 01:13:36,495
- Thank you so much.
- Good luck.

955
01:13:36,621 --> 01:13:39,123
How you doing, kid? Good to see you.

956
01:14:01,980 --> 01:14:04,523
Well, buddy, they love it so far.

957
01:14:08,028 --> 01:14:10,654
You got any prejudices against girls?

958
01:14:12,782 --> 01:14:14,700
That's what I thought.

959
01:14:16,870 --> 01:14:19,538
Well, now, it looks like
you're all primed for a big night, Tom.

960
01:14:19,581 --> 01:14:21,373
- Hello, Stark.
- Want some company?

961
01:14:21,416 --> 01:14:22,916
No, thanks, all tied up.

962
01:14:23,043 --> 01:14:24,710
Leva tells me you've been
eyeing the Captain's wife

963
01:14:24,836 --> 01:14:27,046
- like a hound dog at hunting time.
- He has, huh?

964
01:14:27,088 --> 01:14:28,881
Superman.

965
01:14:28,923 --> 01:14:31,258
Took up with a lot of men back there
at Fort Bliss.

966
01:14:31,384 --> 01:14:33,302
Well, I wouldn't put stock
in stories like that.

967
01:14:33,386 --> 01:14:34,887
This ain't no story.

968
01:14:34,971 --> 01:14:37,222
Look up on the screen!

969
01:14:37,307 --> 01:14:39,183
Not for long, though.

970
01:14:39,267 --> 01:14:41,644
More powerful than a locomotive!

971
01:14:44,147 --> 01:14:45,731
People can see you.

972
01:14:45,857 --> 01:14:48,067
Faster than a speeding bullet.

973
01:14:48,735 --> 01:14:50,736
Hey, where's Lois Lane?

974
01:14:51,404 --> 01:14:52,571
Hello.

975
01:14:52,906 --> 01:14:55,949
- I didn't think you were coming.
- Why not? I ain't late.

976
01:14:55,950 --> 01:14:56,033
- I didn't think you were coming.
- Why not? I ain't late.

977
01:15:15,512 --> 01:15:18,222
I'll always take care of my boy.

978
01:15:35,156 --> 01:15:36,782
Nice shot, Louie.

979
01:15:52,132 --> 01:15:53,215
Kit?

980
01:16:02,016 --> 01:16:03,517
You listening?

981
01:16:04,602 --> 01:16:06,812
Get the fuck out of my house!

982
01:16:07,313 --> 01:16:10,315
Are you listening? Nod your head.

983
01:16:19,033 --> 01:16:21,493
Be smart. Let it go.

984
01:16:22,912 --> 01:16:25,998
What, your mother's snatch?
She won't let me.

985
01:16:26,082 --> 01:16:27,833
Here's what I mean.

986
01:16:40,221 --> 01:16:42,514
Louis? Louis?

987
01:16:44,225 --> 01:16:47,519
Louis, can you hear me? Louis?

988
01:16:51,858 --> 01:16:55,944
- I'm calling a doctor, all right?
- I don't wanna go to the doctor.

989
01:16:56,029 --> 01:16:58,030
Well, at least some ice.

990
01:16:59,073 --> 01:17:00,949
There's no ice in the fridge.

991
01:17:01,034 --> 01:17:04,369
Stop being stubborn, all right?
You were unconscious.

992
01:17:04,704 --> 01:17:08,081
There's no ice. What did you say?

993
01:17:08,875 --> 01:17:10,417
There's no ice.

994
01:17:16,758 --> 01:17:18,050
Sit down.

995
01:17:24,766 --> 01:17:26,433
What's this about?

996
01:17:32,607 --> 01:17:35,400
This murder bullshit I've been slinging.

997
01:17:36,861 --> 01:17:38,862
I think it might be true.

998
01:17:39,739 --> 01:17:42,616
I can help.
Oh, come on, you know I can.

999
01:17:42,742 --> 01:17:45,244
Kit, let's call it a day, all right?

1000
01:17:45,370 --> 01:17:47,746
- What?
- You shouldn't be around me.

1001
01:17:48,581 --> 01:17:51,124
This isn't some TV show
you wanna be in.

1002
01:17:51,251 --> 01:17:54,586
This is just a fucked-up little business.

1003
01:17:54,671 --> 01:17:57,840
It makes you go around,
and you find out how shitty people are

1004
01:17:57,924 --> 01:17:59,424
to make the rent.

1005
01:17:59,509 --> 01:18:02,427
You don't really believe that.
I know you care about what you do.

1006
01:18:02,512 --> 01:18:04,805
You know what I care about?

1007
01:18:04,889 --> 01:18:09,351
That you're balling this Chad kid
and you don't got the guts to tell me.

1008
01:18:14,774 --> 01:18:15,899
Well, I was...

1009
01:18:15,942 --> 01:18:18,610
Going to. Yeah.
So, now you don't have to.

1010
01:18:24,450 --> 01:18:26,451
Do you want me here today?

1011
01:18:27,161 --> 01:18:29,162
No, I don't think I do.

1012
01:19:18,671 --> 01:19:20,339
Let's go outside.

1013
01:19:25,219 --> 01:19:28,555
- You packing?
- Not when I cross the street for lunch.

1014
01:19:28,681 --> 01:19:30,557
Lou, I do what I'm told.

1015
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:35,312
You took the cash from that rag,
same as me!

1016
01:19:35,396 --> 01:19:37,731
$2,500 for ratting on
some hop-head actress

1017
01:19:37,815 --> 01:19:39,191
and I never said a word!

1018
01:19:39,275 --> 01:19:42,361
'Cause I'm loyal!
To my fucking partner!

1019
01:19:43,613 --> 01:19:44,947
- Rick.
- Why?

1020
01:19:45,031 --> 01:19:48,367
- Didn't say. Just, "Take care of it."
- You tell me why!

1021
01:19:49,285 --> 01:19:53,413
Look, when I helped you out
with the old lady,

1022
01:19:53,539 --> 01:19:56,375
I should've kept my mouth shut.
I had to make good.

1023
01:19:56,417 --> 01:19:58,710
You would have done the same thing,
don't bullshit me!

1024
01:19:58,753 --> 01:20:01,213
That's how the mortgage gets paid!

1025
01:21:06,571 --> 01:21:07,654
What?

1026
01:21:08,614 --> 01:21:09,865
Mr Simo.

1027
01:21:10,324 --> 01:21:11,825
Mr Sinclair?

1028
01:21:12,702 --> 01:21:14,369
You have to stop, okay, I'm not gonna...

1029
01:21:14,454 --> 01:21:16,455
I need your help.

1030
01:21:17,665 --> 01:21:19,166
Things are...

1031
01:21:22,086 --> 01:21:24,212
They're not what they seem.

1032
01:21:25,506 --> 01:21:28,633
- What are you saying?
- I've misjudged terribly.

1033
01:21:29,802 --> 01:21:30,969
And...

1034
01:21:31,846 --> 01:21:35,474
Can you meet with me, Mr Simo?
I won't bother you again.

1035
01:21:38,061 --> 01:21:39,311
Please.

1036
01:21:40,021 --> 01:21:41,563
Meet you where?

1037
01:22:50,883 --> 01:22:52,884
What are you doing here?

1038
01:22:53,386 --> 01:22:55,762
I... My client...

1039
01:22:55,847 --> 01:22:57,639
She was your client?

1040
01:23:02,228 --> 01:23:04,104
Shot her in the throat,

1041
01:23:04,897 --> 01:23:06,106
the heart

1042
01:23:07,692 --> 01:23:09,109
and then the vagina.

1043
01:23:09,235 --> 01:23:10,443
Mr Simo.

1044
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:13,905
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1045
01:23:13,948 --> 01:23:16,950
I do wish you'd been prompt.
I suppose the fault is mine

1046
01:23:17,076 --> 01:23:20,245
for failing to see that you and
your whore were not aiding me,

1047
01:23:20,329 --> 01:23:23,498
but guarding the rampant fornications
of my wife.

1048
01:23:24,750 --> 01:23:26,793
I hope you've learnt the meaning
of justice.

1049
01:23:26,878 --> 01:23:28,128
Come on.

1050
01:23:36,971 --> 01:23:38,638
This one's easier

1051
01:23:40,933 --> 01:23:42,809
than your other murder.

1052
01:23:59,035 --> 01:24:01,077
So, what's the emergency?

1053
01:24:02,163 --> 01:24:03,872
Better have a drink, Art.

1054
01:24:03,956 --> 01:24:07,125
It's 10:30 in the morning. What?

1055
01:24:08,461 --> 01:24:11,004
- It's pretty bad.
- What is?

1056
01:24:12,506 --> 01:24:15,008
Enough, George. Let's deal with it.

1057
01:24:16,677 --> 01:24:18,303
We're cancelled.

1058
01:24:25,853 --> 01:24:27,520
I just don't see the point.

1059
01:24:27,605 --> 01:24:30,357
The point
is it's my production company.

1060
01:24:30,441 --> 01:24:32,108
If I don't sell myself, who will?

1061
01:24:32,610 --> 01:24:36,404
- The business is here, George.
- Yes, but the money's in New York.

1062
01:24:36,489 --> 01:24:38,823
I can get in the papers there.

1063
01:24:38,866 --> 01:24:41,660
- It's a lot of bother.
- I want to do this.

1064
01:24:41,702 --> 01:24:44,663
I'm looking forward to it.
I'll take charge of my own life.

1065
01:24:44,705 --> 01:24:47,916
- I see.
- No, you don't.

1066
01:24:48,542 --> 01:24:50,669
You think I should just sit around here,
doing God knows what,

1067
01:24:50,711 --> 01:24:53,046
- while the both of us...
- Yes?

1068
01:24:53,172 --> 01:24:54,881
While the both of us what?

1069
01:24:54,966 --> 01:24:58,176
My love, this makes sense to me.

1070
01:24:59,345 --> 01:25:03,431
I can set up my own projects.
Direct and produce and...

1071
01:25:03,516 --> 01:25:07,143
We'll get some other sap
to jump around in coloured underwear.

1072
01:25:07,228 --> 01:25:10,313
Who knows,
maybe I'll direct a picture for MGM.

1073
01:25:13,150 --> 01:25:15,193
I'll be back in two weeks.

1074
01:25:17,405 --> 01:25:18,697
Kiss me.

1075
01:25:19,198 --> 01:25:21,574
- Let me close this.
- You have to.

1076
01:25:25,746 --> 01:25:26,997
Kiss me.

1077
01:25:28,749 --> 01:25:30,542
I have to go. Toni...

1078
01:25:30,626 --> 01:25:32,210
- George, kiss me.
- All right.

1079
01:25:34,964 --> 01:25:36,298
All right.

1080
01:25:56,652 --> 01:25:57,736
Shit.

1081
01:25:57,820 --> 01:26:00,405
That bitch who hired you,
you think she loved Georgie?

1082
01:26:00,489 --> 01:26:03,283
- Who is this?
- He grew up without a father.

1083
01:26:03,367 --> 01:26:07,495
When he's old enough, she finally
tells him what happened to Daddy.

1084
01:26:07,580 --> 01:26:09,414
- Miss Lemmon?
- Suicide.

1085
01:26:09,498 --> 01:26:12,459
Pistol in the mouth. Georgie
never stopped thinking about it.

1086
01:26:12,543 --> 01:26:16,880
Fifteen years later, he gets a visitor.
His father, alive.

1087
01:26:17,298 --> 01:26:20,884
All he'd done was dump the bitch
for another woman. Left Georgie, too.

1088
01:26:21,260 --> 01:26:24,637
So Mommy tells baby,
"Daddy killed himself."

1089
01:26:24,764 --> 01:26:26,639
She tells her own son.

1090
01:26:26,766 --> 01:26:29,642
Georgie swore
he'd never speak to her again.

1091
01:26:30,811 --> 01:26:32,562
This lets you off the hook?

1092
01:26:32,646 --> 01:26:35,648
I didn't screw his head on backwards,
she did.

1093
01:26:36,984 --> 01:26:39,110
Why are you telling me now?

1094
01:26:41,947 --> 01:26:43,156
I'm...

1095
01:26:43,824 --> 01:26:46,201
I'm just a little blotto, sugar.

1096
01:26:47,912 --> 01:26:49,412
Kind of horny.

1097
01:26:50,956 --> 01:26:53,166
And pretty goddamn all alone.

1098
01:26:53,626 --> 01:26:55,668
- So...
- I don't know.

1099
01:26:57,463 --> 01:27:00,507
And I thought maybe
we had something in common.

1100
01:27:31,831 --> 01:27:33,248
Mrs Bessolo?

1101
01:27:44,135 --> 01:27:45,593
Mrs Bessolo.

1102
01:27:46,971 --> 01:27:48,471
Mrs Bessolo!

1103
01:27:52,393 --> 01:27:56,146
I won't be needing your services
any longer, Mr Simo.

1104
01:27:56,188 --> 01:27:59,691
- And when were you going to tell me?
- I intend to mail you a cheque.

1105
01:27:59,733 --> 01:28:02,569
A cheque? That's it?

1106
01:28:02,695 --> 01:28:04,446
I don't owe you anything else.

1107
01:28:04,530 --> 01:28:06,281
How about an explanation?

1108
01:28:06,365 --> 01:28:08,908
How about telling me your son
wouldn't give you the time of day?

1109
01:28:08,993 --> 01:28:11,327
Don't you use that tone with me!

1110
01:28:12,997 --> 01:28:15,707
- Mr Strickling gave me his word.
- Strickling?

1111
01:28:15,791 --> 01:28:17,584
A statue would be erected...

1112
01:28:17,668 --> 01:28:19,419
- A what?
- ...in my son's honour,

1113
01:28:19,503 --> 01:28:21,629
outside the Chinese Theatre.

1114
01:28:23,466 --> 01:28:26,259
You never gave a shit, did you?

1115
01:28:26,385 --> 01:28:27,927
You'll be paid.

1116
01:28:28,721 --> 01:28:30,722
Keep your goddamn cheque.

1117
01:28:31,140 --> 01:28:33,141
My son was a great star.

1118
01:28:34,226 --> 01:28:36,269
He deserves a statue.

1119
01:28:46,780 --> 01:28:49,365
- Can I take your picture?
- Sure.

1120
01:28:49,450 --> 01:28:52,660
- Wait, wait. I blinked, take another one.
- Sorry, no retakes.

1121
01:28:52,745 --> 01:28:54,871
My goddamn eyes were closed.

1122
01:28:57,917 --> 01:29:00,293
- You know who that is over there?
- Can I take your picture?

1123
01:29:00,419 --> 01:29:01,628
Superman.

1124
01:29:03,297 --> 01:29:06,633
Right. He's got to be loaded.

1125
01:29:06,759 --> 01:29:09,969
You know, my little cousins
are glued to that show.

1126
01:29:13,766 --> 01:29:15,350
Look at her ass.

1127
01:29:15,809 --> 01:29:17,185
Len, look.

1128
01:29:21,815 --> 01:29:23,525
What's really exciting to me...

1129
01:29:23,609 --> 01:29:25,151
Earl Wilson.

1130
01:29:25,236 --> 01:29:28,780
Look at you all dressed up.
I haven't seen you since...

1131
01:29:28,906 --> 01:29:31,616
You punched a waiter at Sardi's
and broke his nose.

1132
01:29:31,742 --> 01:29:33,409
I left a nice tip.

1133
01:29:35,955 --> 01:29:38,373
- Find something funny, junior?
- No, no, no.

1134
01:29:38,457 --> 01:29:41,668
- I know when I'm out of my league.
- Don't sell yourself short.

1135
01:29:41,794 --> 01:29:43,461
I got a big heart.

1136
01:29:43,504 --> 01:29:46,005
I'll bet you've got a big one, too.

1137
01:29:48,217 --> 01:29:50,969
That's very nice of you to say, Miss...

1138
01:29:51,762 --> 01:29:54,514
- Leonore Lemmon.
- Miss Lemmon.

1139
01:29:55,516 --> 01:29:59,769
So, how about an autograph
for my poor crippled nephew?

1140
01:29:59,853 --> 01:30:02,730
- Is he in an iron lung?
- He's in Yonkers.

1141
01:30:10,531 --> 01:30:12,699
Superman wants to get laid.

1142
01:30:27,381 --> 01:30:28,673
God damn!

1143
01:30:29,133 --> 01:30:31,384
Make room for fucking Daddy!

1144
01:30:33,178 --> 01:30:35,388
- You know what, stallion?
- What?

1145
01:30:35,472 --> 01:30:38,600
I think you're starting to
get the hang of this.

1146
01:30:41,312 --> 01:30:42,979
Let's do it again.

1147
01:31:01,123 --> 01:31:02,498
Hey, Scout.

1148
01:31:03,208 --> 01:31:06,711
- Mom's picking me up.
- I know that. I just wanted to...

1149
01:31:07,880 --> 01:31:09,672
I got you something.

1150
01:31:14,845 --> 01:31:16,721
I left it in the car.

1151
01:31:16,847 --> 01:31:19,849
I'll give it to you when we go home.
Come on. Let's go.

1152
01:31:22,144 --> 01:31:24,312
How come you're not at work?

1153
01:31:25,397 --> 01:31:29,359
'Cause I don't sit in an office, okay?
That's for suckers.

1154
01:31:29,443 --> 01:31:32,403
Your pop's an investigator, all right?

1155
01:31:32,821 --> 01:31:34,656
Come on, let's go.

1156
01:31:34,740 --> 01:31:36,991
I'm supposed to wait for Mom.

1157
01:31:37,951 --> 01:31:41,454
- What?
- I'm supposed to wait for Mom.

1158
01:31:48,545 --> 01:31:50,797
Your mom and me, we don't...

1159
01:31:55,177 --> 01:31:56,302
Evan.

1160
01:31:58,347 --> 01:31:59,472
Evan.

1161
01:32:01,767 --> 01:32:03,685
Nobody has magic powers.

1162
01:32:04,561 --> 01:32:06,354
You got to be tough.

1163
01:32:08,357 --> 01:32:11,484
You got to show them
what you're made of, you know?

1164
01:32:11,568 --> 01:32:13,861
My father never taught me that.

1165
01:32:16,990 --> 01:32:19,033
Okay, here we go. Come on.

1166
01:32:24,998 --> 01:32:26,290
I'm fine.

1167
01:32:31,630 --> 01:32:35,299
I'm his son. He's my son, he is.

1168
01:32:36,635 --> 01:32:38,386
Tell him, Scout. Just tell him.

1169
01:32:38,470 --> 01:32:40,722
Evan, tell him, please. Come on.

1170
01:32:40,806 --> 01:32:42,348
Evan. Evan.

1171
01:32:46,645 --> 01:32:48,646
Honey, what's the matter?

1172
01:32:49,857 --> 01:32:51,190
Oh, Jesus.

1173
01:32:52,401 --> 01:32:55,236
- Could you take him... Just take him...
- Sure.

1174
01:33:14,381 --> 01:33:16,924
Whatever you want to say, you know.

1175
01:33:18,302 --> 01:33:20,762
Are you going to fight everybody?

1176
01:33:21,597 --> 01:33:23,931
I thought you liked tough guys.

1177
01:33:39,406 --> 01:33:42,784
- You're saying this why?
- I want to be honest with you.

1178
01:33:42,868 --> 01:33:44,535
My, that's noble.

1179
01:33:45,370 --> 01:33:48,790
What is that, from some script
you auditioned for in the '40s?

1180
01:33:48,874 --> 01:33:51,292
No. It's just me, talking to you.

1181
01:33:51,752 --> 01:33:53,377
I'm so grateful.

1182
01:33:53,796 --> 01:33:55,171
Straight arrow George!

1183
01:33:55,255 --> 01:33:57,173
You go to New York,
and you fuck some whore,

1184
01:33:57,257 --> 01:33:58,549
and you run back to tell me!

1185
01:33:58,634 --> 01:34:00,384
She's not a whore.

1186
01:34:00,469 --> 01:34:03,262
She's an actress. A singer?

1187
01:34:03,972 --> 01:34:06,724
Does she blow smoke rings
with her cunt?

1188
01:34:08,727 --> 01:34:10,561
Is it a fling you want?

1189
01:34:10,604 --> 01:34:13,231
- It's not a fling.
- Oh, you're in love!

1190
01:34:14,066 --> 01:34:17,443
- Two weeks in a hotel room?
- She makes me feel young.

1191
01:34:20,739 --> 01:34:23,032
Have you seen yourself, George?

1192
01:34:23,659 --> 01:34:25,993
- Your face is going.
- Don't do this.

1193
01:34:26,078 --> 01:34:27,578
Here, your eyes, your hair,
your stomach.

1194
01:34:27,663 --> 01:34:28,830
Stop it.

1195
01:34:28,914 --> 01:34:30,498
- You think no one notices?
- Toni, don't do this.

1196
01:34:30,582 --> 01:34:32,333
But you've got your projects,
haven't you?

1197
01:34:32,417 --> 01:34:34,126
You're going to be a director.

1198
01:34:34,211 --> 01:34:36,838
You'll sit in your little canvas chair,
polishing your balls.

1199
01:34:36,922 --> 01:34:38,714
Thank God I'm rid of that hag
I had to screw.

1200
01:34:38,757 --> 01:34:40,591
What was her name?
The one who paid for everything!

1201
01:34:40,717 --> 01:34:42,260
The one who
bought me a fucking house!

1202
01:34:42,344 --> 01:34:43,427
For God's sake!

1203
01:34:43,470 --> 01:34:47,098
You want publicity?
You'll get it. I'll say you're a Red.

1204
01:34:47,474 --> 01:34:50,268
And a faggot. A lush.
Nobody can call that a lie.

1205
01:34:50,310 --> 01:34:52,770
You know what? You've never
helped me. You never helped me!

1206
01:34:52,813 --> 01:34:53,938
You could've talked to Eddie.

1207
01:34:53,981 --> 01:34:55,690
You could've gotten me something,
but you didn't!

1208
01:34:55,774 --> 01:34:58,442
Because you liked me where I was,
in a fucking red suit!

1209
01:34:58,527 --> 01:35:01,028
You liked that! Well, that's not
who I am, you understand?

1210
01:35:01,113 --> 01:35:02,530
God damn you!

1211
01:35:03,407 --> 01:35:05,491
But, George, that's all
you were good for.

1212
01:35:05,576 --> 01:35:07,702
Ten-year-olds and shut-ins.

1213
01:35:08,036 --> 01:35:10,872
That was the best
you were ever going to be.

1214
01:35:10,956 --> 01:35:14,083
I knew that. Why didn't you?

1215
01:35:19,965 --> 01:35:23,467
They rushed it and closed the case.
I didn't like it from the start.

1216
01:35:23,552 --> 01:35:24,635
Why?

1217
01:35:27,973 --> 01:35:29,724
There was pressure.

1218
01:35:30,434 --> 01:35:32,184
Oh, yeah? From who?

1219
01:35:33,061 --> 01:35:36,230
Look, I can't do what you can do.
Understand?

1220
01:35:36,315 --> 01:35:40,276
I got a wife, kids, car payments.

1221
01:35:40,360 --> 01:35:44,071
- Look, I'm in for 20 and a pension.
- But I got nothing to lose, huh?

1222
01:35:44,156 --> 01:35:47,283
Look, think it through.
MGM buys off the mother.

1223
01:35:47,326 --> 01:35:49,410
I'm not getting paid, pal.

1224
01:35:49,828 --> 01:35:52,455
- That's all it's about for you.
- Hey.

1225
01:35:55,626 --> 01:35:58,920
I got that woman killed.
For nothing, okay?

1226
01:35:59,004 --> 01:36:01,088
Fifty bucks a day,
I'm stringing her husband along

1227
01:36:01,173 --> 01:36:04,342
like I'm running him 'cause
I can't see straight in front of me.

1228
01:36:04,384 --> 01:36:06,677
No. I'm done.

1229
01:36:06,762 --> 01:36:09,430
Look, this is how they work
and it just gets buried.

1230
01:36:09,514 --> 01:36:12,099
Don't you want to know about this guy?

1231
01:36:12,184 --> 01:36:15,269
Why don't you get on the right side
of something for once?

1232
01:36:15,354 --> 01:36:18,230
Where do you come off
telling me what I should do?

1233
01:36:18,315 --> 01:36:21,442
Well, I'm not the one
with the guilty conscience, am I?

1234
01:38:09,134 --> 01:38:13,304
- Who wants me to wrestle?
- Professional circuit. They're serious.

1235
01:38:14,222 --> 01:38:16,557
You might get a kick out of it.

1236
01:38:17,017 --> 01:38:18,392
What do you got, a party?

1237
01:38:18,477 --> 01:38:21,729
No. Just a few friends
of Leonore's making a racket.

1238
01:38:21,813 --> 01:38:24,732
So now when that old bitch calls,
this gizmo records it automatically.

1239
01:38:24,816 --> 01:38:27,068
- So at least the cops believe us.
- I got a delivery for Mr Reeves.

1240
01:38:27,152 --> 01:38:29,153
Hey, in there! Excuse me.

1241
01:38:29,738 --> 01:38:30,905
Sorry.

1242
01:38:32,866 --> 01:38:34,700
Put that on the table.

1243
01:38:35,744 --> 01:38:38,579
Georgie, why don't you show this boy
how much we love him?

1244
01:38:38,663 --> 01:38:39,747
All right.

1245
01:38:39,831 --> 01:38:42,666
Why don't we take it easy
on this batch, Len?

1246
01:38:46,046 --> 01:38:49,423
All right, kid, here's $100.
Go make your first million.

1247
01:38:49,508 --> 01:38:52,551
Georgie, you are directing
your own movie in a month.

1248
01:38:52,677 --> 01:38:54,261
Live a little, okay?
Or take a headache pill.

1249
01:38:54,346 --> 01:38:56,263
- Just don't ruin the party, okay?
- All right.

1250
01:38:56,348 --> 01:38:59,433
Give me a kiss. Go. Go on.

1251
01:38:59,518 --> 01:39:02,186
- All right, all right.
- I'll fix you a drink, all right?

1252
01:39:45,313 --> 01:39:46,480
Yeah?

1253
01:39:46,982 --> 01:39:48,440
That actor...

1254
01:39:48,984 --> 01:39:52,570
Eddie, it's very late.

1255
01:39:53,029 --> 01:39:56,073
What's he plan to do
with the rest of his life?

1256
01:39:56,199 --> 01:40:00,828
He has some spaceman script set up
with Wasserman.

1257
01:40:01,663 --> 01:40:02,830
To direct.

1258
01:40:02,914 --> 01:40:04,331
If you offered some kind of...

1259
01:40:04,416 --> 01:40:06,917
Yeah, yeah. I know how to handle it.

1260
01:40:21,641 --> 01:40:23,267
Well, all right.

1261
01:40:24,686 --> 01:40:26,020
Very nice.

1262
01:40:26,897 --> 01:40:29,106
Thank you. You're very kind.

1263
01:40:29,733 --> 01:40:33,152
What did you think,
my sweetest dream? Moved to tears?

1264
01:40:33,278 --> 01:40:36,155
I thought you sounded
like a goddamn beaner.

1265
01:40:36,615 --> 01:40:38,616
Well, and so good night.

1266
01:40:58,303 --> 01:40:59,386
Hey!

1267
01:41:21,243 --> 01:41:24,912
Universal is not the only studio.
Get him in the door someplace else.

1268
01:41:24,996 --> 01:41:27,039
- I already tried.
- Try harder.

1269
01:41:27,123 --> 01:41:29,291
He's your only client.
What kind of bullshit agent are you?

1270
01:41:29,376 --> 01:41:30,709
- Leonore.
- You come around here,

1271
01:41:30,794 --> 01:41:32,336
dragging around
like a wet goddamn dog!

1272
01:41:32,420 --> 01:41:34,004
Leonore, stop it!

1273
01:41:36,341 --> 01:41:39,134
Art, we talked about this.

1274
01:41:39,803 --> 01:41:42,429
This picture's important. Or it was.

1275
01:41:44,099 --> 01:41:46,767
These people don't want me.
They don't know what I can do.

1276
01:41:46,851 --> 01:41:50,062
And we got to show it to them, show
them I can do something different.

1277
01:41:50,146 --> 01:41:52,856
We got to cook something up
for me now.

1278
01:41:53,483 --> 01:41:55,276
The wrestling offer.

1279
01:41:58,530 --> 01:41:59,863
Does it pay?

1280
01:41:59,948 --> 01:42:04,994
Their only concern,
are you up to it physically?

1281
01:42:08,373 --> 01:42:09,999
Well, we'll...

1282
01:42:10,041 --> 01:42:13,335
You can film me, so they can see.

1283
01:42:13,378 --> 01:42:16,213
Why don't you just join
the goddamn circus?

1284
01:42:59,007 --> 01:43:00,674
How are you doing?

1285
01:43:31,998 --> 01:43:33,374
Mrs Mannix?

1286
01:43:35,752 --> 01:43:37,753
I'll just put it on the bed.

1287
01:44:03,238 --> 01:44:04,655
Mrs Mannix?

1288
01:44:11,079 --> 01:44:13,372
Mrs Mannix, can I talk to you?

1289
01:44:13,456 --> 01:44:15,124
It's about George.

1290
01:44:19,754 --> 01:44:23,424
George shot himself.

1291
01:44:24,259 --> 01:44:25,843
He was shot.

1292
01:44:26,719 --> 01:44:29,430
Someone shot him,
is that what you mean?

1293
01:44:29,681 --> 01:44:31,181
Who did that?

1294
01:44:33,643 --> 01:44:35,018
Mrs Mannix.

1295
01:44:36,688 --> 01:44:38,856
Can you help me understand?

1296
01:44:40,442 --> 01:44:42,192
Will you please help me?

1297
01:44:42,235 --> 01:44:44,027
Did you know George?

1298
01:44:46,406 --> 01:44:48,740
Why don't you tell me about him?

1299
01:44:49,492 --> 01:44:53,662
He really was the most beautiful boy.

1300
01:44:54,038 --> 01:44:56,039
Mrs Mannix, please,
if I could just come in.

1301
01:44:56,124 --> 01:44:58,041
You're not invited, Simo.

1302
01:45:00,712 --> 01:45:02,921
- Were you?
- We're working.

1303
01:45:03,006 --> 01:45:04,214
Come on.

1304
01:45:10,263 --> 01:45:12,139
Why don't you lay off?

1305
01:45:15,560 --> 01:45:18,312
- Mr Harris.
- Hello, Louis.

1306
01:45:18,396 --> 01:45:21,315
You come up from Palos Verdes
just to see me?

1307
01:45:21,399 --> 01:45:24,526
I came here
to celebrate my friends' anniversary.

1308
01:45:25,236 --> 01:45:29,448
- You've met Mr Mannix.
- No, but we got people in common.

1309
01:45:30,950 --> 01:45:32,659
Ain't that right, Eddie?

1310
01:45:32,744 --> 01:45:35,287
I've got nothing in common with you.

1311
01:45:38,166 --> 01:45:40,542
Bernice, the first missus.

1312
01:45:41,586 --> 01:45:44,379
You like that car crash gimmick, huh?

1313
01:45:44,422 --> 01:45:46,256
- Rick...
- Riva Watson.

1314
01:45:47,592 --> 01:45:49,593
She get all clingy?

1315
01:45:49,636 --> 01:45:51,762
How'd it feel, pounding her face in?

1316
01:45:51,804 --> 01:45:54,264
- Happy times, huh, Ed?
- Richard, please.

1317
01:45:54,307 --> 01:45:56,266
- George Reeves...
- That's enough, Louis.

1318
01:45:56,309 --> 01:45:59,728
Am I being indiscreet?
Bad for business, huh?

1319
01:45:59,812 --> 01:46:02,397
- Louis, your problems are your own.
- Ricky, you cover for this prick?

1320
01:46:02,482 --> 01:46:04,107
Whatever you're pursuing here.
Whatever fantasy...

1321
01:46:04,192 --> 01:46:05,943
You had a bullet put in Reeves' head!

1322
01:46:06,027 --> 01:46:07,444
...you constructed
will not alter your past.

1323
01:46:07,529 --> 01:46:09,655
He used the studio and the cops...

1324
01:46:13,034 --> 01:46:15,786
You're going to burn in hell,
you son of a bitch!

1325
01:46:20,667 --> 01:46:22,084
Come here.

1326
01:46:25,880 --> 01:46:27,631
You don't know me.

1327
01:46:28,383 --> 01:46:31,218
You don't know what I think. What I do.

1328
01:46:32,262 --> 01:46:33,595
I don't let you.

1329
01:46:33,680 --> 01:46:35,681
You're an old man, Eddie.

1330
01:46:36,391 --> 01:46:38,100
Who's going to wipe the blood
off your hands?

1331
01:46:38,184 --> 01:46:39,810
My hands?

1332
01:46:39,894 --> 01:46:41,979
I'm in the picture business.

1333
01:46:42,063 --> 01:46:43,939
No, you're a murderer.

1334
01:46:45,400 --> 01:46:46,650
Prove it.

1335
01:46:47,485 --> 01:46:51,488
You hear me? Go on, I'm ready.

1336
01:46:52,407 --> 01:46:54,783
Prove one fucking thing.

1337
01:47:04,877 --> 01:47:06,169
Oh, God.

1338
01:47:39,078 --> 01:47:42,205
People are waiting. You coming down?

1339
01:47:44,626 --> 01:47:46,752
- Help with the dress.
- Yeah.

1340
01:47:55,053 --> 01:47:56,178
Okay?

1341
01:47:58,931 --> 01:48:01,058
I'm gonna let some light in.

1342
01:48:14,906 --> 01:48:17,074
I want to tell you something.

1343
01:48:18,826 --> 01:48:21,495
You know I'll always take care of you.

1344
01:48:22,789 --> 01:48:24,706
Whatever's happened...

1345
01:48:26,709 --> 01:48:30,337
Whatever might have been done.
It doesn't matter.

1346
01:48:31,547 --> 01:48:33,674
Nobody's going to hurt you.

1347
01:48:35,468 --> 01:48:39,304
Nobody gets to ask. I won't allow it.

1348
01:48:40,932 --> 01:48:44,434
You're safe with me.
With your husband.

1349
01:48:48,106 --> 01:48:50,357
Let me see what you look like.

1350
01:49:03,871 --> 01:49:05,497
You're beautiful.

1351
01:49:09,752 --> 01:49:11,545
You always will be.

1352
01:49:17,969 --> 01:49:19,636
I see the pieces.

1353
01:49:21,055 --> 01:49:22,806
How they should fit.

1354
01:49:24,726 --> 01:49:26,643
How I want them to fit.

1355
01:49:29,147 --> 01:49:30,605
But I can't.

1356
01:49:39,157 --> 01:49:40,991
I looked in his face.

1357
01:49:42,201 --> 01:49:45,287
I know he could do it.
Wouldn't think about it twice.

1358
01:49:45,371 --> 01:49:47,456
- Eddie Mannix?
- Yeah.

1359
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,835
No, I would never say
it wasn't possible.

1360
01:49:54,172 --> 01:49:56,089
What about Mrs Mannix?

1361
01:49:56,174 --> 01:49:58,759
You had to like her. Such brightness.

1362
01:49:59,844 --> 01:50:02,512
Could she have done
what you're saying?

1363
01:50:05,141 --> 01:50:07,267
I don't want to think that.

1364
01:50:08,102 --> 01:50:09,478
And Leonore?

1365
01:50:09,562 --> 01:50:12,314
We never got along. Leave it there.

1366
01:50:19,989 --> 01:50:21,364
Mr Reeves?

1367
01:50:22,450 --> 01:50:24,117
A charming man.

1368
01:50:26,537 --> 01:50:28,705
Funny. Handsome.

1369
01:50:29,707 --> 01:50:33,710
Not like the ones today.
All the squinting and the mumbling.

1370
01:50:33,753 --> 01:50:35,420
A movie-star face.

1371
01:50:38,216 --> 01:50:39,841
Why wasn't he one?

1372
01:50:42,887 --> 01:50:47,474
Where he wound up,
it should have been enough, right?

1373
01:50:48,601 --> 01:50:50,268
Enough for a life.

1374
01:50:52,188 --> 01:50:53,647
But George...

1375
01:50:57,735 --> 01:50:58,860
Yeah?

1376
01:51:08,079 --> 01:51:11,248
I never showed this.
I knew it wouldn't help.

1377
01:51:14,418 --> 01:51:15,877
You watch it.

1378
01:51:19,632 --> 01:51:21,466
Tell me what you see.

1379
01:54:02,837 --> 01:54:04,254
Good night.

1380
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:08,060
