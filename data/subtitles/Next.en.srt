1
00:00:02,286 --> 00:00:05,165
I've just got to hand this in
to Armstrong. I'll see you later.

2
00:00:22,727 --> 00:00:24,327
So, I'm telling
my mom that joke...

3
00:00:24,327 --> 00:00:25,806
you know, the one about the duck?

4
00:00:25,806 --> 00:00:27,286
That one's pretty good.

5
00:00:27,286 --> 00:00:30,882
And when I tell her the punchline,
she spews milk out of her <i>nose.</i>

6
00:00:33,286 --> 00:00:34,767
Uh, Emma?

7
00:00:34,767 --> 00:00:38,207
Milk. Out of my mom's nose. Funny?

8
00:00:38,207 --> 00:00:39,326
Huh?

9
00:00:39,326 --> 00:00:40,840
Oh, yeah. Funny, J.T.

10
00:00:45,926 --> 00:00:47,406
What's going on?

11
00:00:47,406 --> 00:00:49,125
Nothing. Just writing some emails.

12
00:00:50,686 --> 00:00:52,966
Um, I wanted to ask you...

13
00:00:52,966 --> 00:00:55,686
I saw you and Armstrong
this morning.

14
00:00:55,686 --> 00:00:57,726
And what's your point?

15
00:00:57,726 --> 00:01:01,207
Uh, it looked like...

16
00:01:01,207 --> 00:01:02,887
Looked like what?

17
00:01:02,887 --> 00:01:05,686
I had a few questions
about equations.

18
00:01:05,686 --> 00:01:07,165
So?

19
00:01:08,167 --> 00:01:11,486
Are you trying to read my emails?
No, not at all.

20
00:01:11,486 --> 00:01:13,637
Emails are private.
Mind your own business.

21
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
<b><font color="#0E7521">Corrected By mstoll</font></b>

22
00:02:13,407 --> 00:02:15,567
Don't you think
you're being a bit obvious?

23
00:02:15,567 --> 00:02:18,206
About what?
Sean.

24
00:02:18,206 --> 00:02:20,800
If you stare any harder,
your eyeballs will pop out.

25
00:02:21,806 --> 00:02:23,806
J.T., what do you think
of Armstrong?

26
00:02:23,806 --> 00:02:25,966
I mean, as a person.

27
00:02:25,966 --> 00:02:27,687
Teachers aren't people.

28
00:02:27,687 --> 00:02:30,847
They're... teachers.

29
00:02:30,847 --> 00:02:32,687
You know what I mean.

30
00:02:32,687 --> 00:02:34,687
Do you think he's... OK?

31
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:38,606
Oh, yeah. Armstrong's given me
lots of extra help.

32
00:02:38,606 --> 00:02:41,727
He's been really nice. To me, anyway.

33
00:02:41,727 --> 00:02:44,764
Yeah. Come to think of it,
he's nice to everyone.

34
00:03:02,366 --> 00:03:04,247
You going to eat that?
Huh?

35
00:03:04,247 --> 00:03:05,725
No. You take it.

36
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:10,126
Something I said?

37
00:03:12,766 --> 00:03:14,961
Hey, Sheila. Two specials, please.

38
00:03:17,926 --> 00:03:19,847
What is that? Nuclear waste?

39
00:03:19,847 --> 00:03:21,723
I don't want to hear about it,
Gavin.

40
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:25,847
Hey, guys. Did you see
the sign in the bathroom?

41
00:03:25,847 --> 00:03:27,926
"Flush twice...
it's a long way to the cafeteria'.

42
00:03:27,926 --> 00:03:29,407
Gavin.

43
00:03:29,407 --> 00:03:31,247
It might take you
a few extra years,

44
00:03:31,247 --> 00:03:33,807
but I can't wait
for the day you graduate.

45
00:03:49,966 --> 00:03:51,447
Oh, man!

46
00:03:51,447 --> 00:03:53,727
Eugh! What is it? Eugh! Eugh!

47
00:03:53,727 --> 00:03:56,766
Sheila, there's a bug in my squash.

48
00:03:56,766 --> 00:04:00,486
Yeah. I think the joke goes,
"Waiter, there's a fly in my soup."

49
00:04:00,486 --> 00:04:02,556
I'm serious. It's right up...

50
00:04:04,887 --> 00:04:06,366
Yeah. Nice try, Gavin.

51
00:04:06,366 --> 00:04:09,486
By the way, don't forget to pay
for that. It's $4.99 plus tax.

52
00:04:09,486 --> 00:04:10,966
Next.

53
00:04:15,727 --> 00:04:19,406
So, Em, for Media Immersion,
should we use HTML?

54
00:04:19,406 --> 00:04:21,398
Yeah, sure. Whatever.

55
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:26,238
Manny, has Armstrong
ever touched you?

56
00:04:27,846 --> 00:04:29,447
What?! No.

57
00:04:29,447 --> 00:04:30,927
Did he touch <i>you'?</i>

58
00:04:30,927 --> 00:04:34,007
No, no, not me. Liberty.

59
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:35,803
I saw him touching Liberty.

60
00:04:37,286 --> 00:04:38,766
Are you sure?

61
00:04:40,567 --> 00:04:43,286
Yeah. I know what I saw.

62
00:04:43,286 --> 00:04:44,966
I don't know, Em.

63
00:04:44,966 --> 00:04:48,086
Armstrong's a pretty physical guy.

64
00:04:48,086 --> 00:04:49,726
Maybe you got the wrong idea.

65
00:04:49,726 --> 00:04:51,206
I hope so.

66
00:04:52,887 --> 00:04:55,687
But this morning
he had his arm around Liberty.

67
00:04:55,687 --> 00:04:58,086
And I saw him pass her a note
outside.

68
00:04:58,086 --> 00:05:01,007
It really looked like
he was coming on to her.

69
00:05:01,007 --> 00:05:02,966
Mr Armstrong?

70
00:05:02,966 --> 00:05:04,726
You've got
to be making this up.

71
00:05:04,726 --> 00:05:06,206
No, I swear.

72
00:05:06,206 --> 00:05:08,406
It just so happens you're always
complaining about the food

73
00:05:08,406 --> 00:05:09,887
and now you find a bug?

74
00:05:09,887 --> 00:05:11,646
Hmm.
Paige. Come on.

75
00:05:11,646 --> 00:05:14,127
Does this look like
the face of a liar?

76
00:05:14,127 --> 00:05:16,047
You want an honest answer?

77
00:05:16,047 --> 00:05:17,927
Why won't anyone believe me?

78
00:05:17,927 --> 00:05:19,406
Tell her, Jimmy.

79
00:05:19,406 --> 00:05:22,247
There was some kind of weirdness
on his plate.

80
00:05:22,247 --> 00:05:24,086
Are you sure it wasn't just a hair?

81
00:05:24,086 --> 00:05:27,406
A moth, I think.
An earwig, dude. An earwig.

82
00:05:27,406 --> 00:05:30,000
See? You two can't even
get your story straight.

83
00:05:31,807 --> 00:05:33,286
Boycott the caff!

84
00:05:33,286 --> 00:05:36,766
Hey, guys. The caff has bugs.
Boycott the caff!

85
00:05:36,766 --> 00:05:38,404
That's a serious accusation.

86
00:05:39,726 --> 00:05:43,367
Ms Kwan, I found a bug in my food...
an earwig.

87
00:05:43,367 --> 00:05:45,367
And where's this offensive creature
now?

88
00:05:45,367 --> 00:05:47,526
Stuck to a kid's shoe.

89
00:05:47,526 --> 00:05:49,567
Gavin, defamation
and rumour-mongering

90
00:05:49,567 --> 00:05:51,047
are serious offences.

91
00:05:51,047 --> 00:05:54,278
The next time you have an accusation
like that, you'd better have proof!

92
00:06:08,726 --> 00:06:11,127
What's with you?
You look awful.

93
00:06:11,127 --> 00:06:12,606
Thanks, Paige.

94
00:06:12,606 --> 00:06:14,846
No. I mean, what's going on?

95
00:06:14,846 --> 00:06:17,887
It's good to get things off your
chest. You'll feel way better.

96
00:06:17,887 --> 00:06:19,639
I guess so, but...

97
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:22,887
Terri, we're friends, right?

98
00:06:22,887 --> 00:06:24,444
Friends talk to each other.

99
00:06:25,687 --> 00:06:28,807
OK. But you have to promise
to keep it a secret.

100
00:06:28,807 --> 00:06:30,966
I really mean it.
Of course.

101
00:06:30,966 --> 00:06:32,447
What is it?

102
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:35,687
You know Liberty?
That kid in seventh grade?

103
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:39,156
Well, I heard
Armstrong was coming on to her.

104
00:06:42,487 --> 00:06:45,167
Eugh! You're kidding, right?

105
00:06:45,167 --> 00:06:47,447
No. I overheard Emma.

106
00:06:47,447 --> 00:06:49,247
She saw him with his arm around her.

107
00:06:49,247 --> 00:06:51,247
And on the steps,
he gave her a love note.

108
00:06:51,247 --> 00:06:53,047
So, what do we do? Report it?

109
00:06:53,047 --> 00:06:55,766
Hon, you can't report a rumour.

110
00:07:03,406 --> 00:07:04,886
Afternoon, everyone.

111
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:10,367
Is something wrong, girls?

112
00:07:10,367 --> 00:07:14,485
Oh.
No, nothing, Mr Armstrong.

113
00:07:16,646 --> 00:07:18,127
OK.

114
00:07:18,127 --> 00:07:21,084
Today we're going to take a look
at distributive properties.

115
00:07:23,286 --> 00:07:27,247
Alright, in review, you'll remember
the three main rules...

116
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:29,526
do the operations in the brackets,

117
00:07:29,526 --> 00:07:31,721
multiplication, division...

118
00:07:42,887 --> 00:07:47,047
Get this... Liberty and Armstrong
were seen kissing outside.

119
00:07:47,047 --> 00:07:50,356
Yeah. They were in his car, kissing,
in front of everybody.

120
00:07:52,526 --> 00:07:54,726
She got a ride in with him
this morning.

121
00:07:54,726 --> 00:07:56,766
Do you think
they spent the night together?

122
00:07:56,766 --> 00:07:58,836
How could Coach Armstrong do that?!

123
00:08:02,367 --> 00:08:05,439
Dude, Liberty and Armstrong
are doing it!

124
00:08:35,126 --> 00:08:36,606
There she is!

125
00:08:38,086 --> 00:08:41,687
Next on the agenda, the motion that
Liberty put forward last meeting.

126
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,647
Right. About the talent show.

127
00:08:43,647 --> 00:08:45,726
So, what do you think, Ashley?
Should we have one?

128
00:08:45,726 --> 00:08:47,318
Sure. Sounds great.

129
00:08:50,886 --> 00:08:52,366
Wow. That was easy.

130
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:54,517
We argued about it for hours
last week.

131
00:08:55,606 --> 00:08:57,086
Yeah, I know.

132
00:08:57,086 --> 00:08:59,726
Guys, you can stop whispering.
I know what you're talking about.

133
00:08:59,726 --> 00:09:02,567
Um, you do?
Of course.

134
00:09:02,567 --> 00:09:05,206
Everyone knows what happened,
so we might as well discuss it.

135
00:09:05,206 --> 00:09:10,047
Um... OK. But don't you want
to discuss it in private?

136
00:09:10,047 --> 00:09:11,886
It's no secret, Ashley.

137
00:09:11,886 --> 00:09:15,287
We all know some microphones
were stolen at last year's show.

138
00:09:15,287 --> 00:09:18,164
But it won't happen this year.
I promise.

139
00:09:22,047 --> 00:09:23,639
Liberty?

140
00:09:25,086 --> 00:09:27,807
If it's about the microphones...
It's not.

141
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:30,400
Do you even know what's going on?

142
00:09:31,606 --> 00:09:34,447
People are talking
about you and Armstrong,

143
00:09:34,447 --> 00:09:36,767
that you're pretty close.

144
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,527
What does that mean?

145
00:09:38,527 --> 00:09:42,807
It means that people think
you two are, um...

146
00:09:42,807 --> 00:09:44,923
...extra friendly.

147
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:49,246
They... they think
he's doing things to me?

148
00:09:49,246 --> 00:09:52,886
Yes. Is it true?
Of course not!

149
00:09:52,886 --> 00:09:55,927
If it is, we have to report it.

150
00:09:55,927 --> 00:09:58,884
Liberty, please, just wait.
We can talk.

151
00:10:14,807 --> 00:10:16,767
I <i>knew</i> something was going on.

152
00:10:16,767 --> 00:10:18,246
You did?

153
00:10:18,246 --> 00:10:19,726
We talked about it yesterday.

154
00:10:19,726 --> 00:10:22,527
I just couldn't believe it.
I still can't.

155
00:10:22,527 --> 00:10:24,326
Maybe we should report it.

156
00:10:24,326 --> 00:10:26,287
Armstrong would be toast.

157
00:10:26,287 --> 00:10:28,527
That's true. We should wait
and find out for sure.

158
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:31,447
This whole thing, it's disgusting.

159
00:10:31,447 --> 00:10:33,126
Just the thought of it. Ugh!

160
00:10:33,126 --> 00:10:34,726
It makes me want to take a shower.

161
00:10:34,726 --> 00:10:37,047
That wouldn't be such a bad idea.

162
00:10:37,047 --> 00:10:38,605
So, what do we do now?

163
00:10:59,287 --> 00:11:00,879
Leave me alone, Emma.

164
00:11:01,886 --> 00:11:05,326
Liberty, what you need right now
is a friend, someone to talk to.

165
00:11:05,326 --> 00:11:07,167
But there's nothing to talk about.

166
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:11,006
It's OK. You can tell me.
I <i>am</i> telling you!

167
00:11:11,006 --> 00:11:12,687
Are you sure you're not lying?

168
00:11:12,687 --> 00:11:14,206
Because we really have to report it.

169
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:18,407
Emma! I swear on my life
that nothing's going on.

170
00:11:18,407 --> 00:11:20,246
The whole school is talking.

171
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:23,486
I know. And it's just
a vicious rumour, honest.

172
00:11:23,486 --> 00:11:25,606
What if it gets to Raditch?

173
00:11:25,606 --> 00:11:27,278
To my parents?

174
00:11:28,326 --> 00:11:31,125
What'll Mr Armstrong say
when he hears this?

175
00:11:34,167 --> 00:11:36,126
Then there's only one way
to handle this...

176
00:11:36,126 --> 00:11:38,527
stop the rumour
and track down its source.

177
00:11:38,527 --> 00:11:41,846
Then give whoever started it...
A good, swift kick?

178
00:11:41,846 --> 00:11:44,725
I was going to say a good talking-to,
but that'll do.

179
00:11:54,287 --> 00:11:56,846
Hey, Spinner. Find any bugs
in your breakfast this morning?

180
00:11:56,846 --> 00:11:58,326
Very funny.

181
00:11:58,326 --> 00:11:59,806
So I made a mistake.

182
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:03,006
Why did you say you made a mistake?

183
00:12:03,006 --> 00:12:04,486
Because I did.

184
00:12:04,486 --> 00:12:06,606
What?!

185
00:12:06,606 --> 00:12:08,846
I'm always complaining
about the food, right?

186
00:12:08,846 --> 00:12:10,886
So I must've made it up.

187
00:12:10,886 --> 00:12:13,047
OK. Now I'm completely confused.

188
00:12:13,047 --> 00:12:16,246
It would've been totally different
if someone else found that bug.

189
00:12:16,246 --> 00:12:19,246
Then everyone would believe it,
even the "Wrath of Kwan'.

190
00:12:19,246 --> 00:12:20,725
I guess so.

191
00:12:29,807 --> 00:12:31,923
Better not be tuna salad in here.

192
00:12:35,206 --> 00:12:36,206
Ugh!

193
00:12:36,206 --> 00:12:38,807
Today's special... earwig surprise.

194
00:12:38,807 --> 00:12:40,479
It took me hours to collect them.

195
00:12:42,206 --> 00:12:45,721
When I get done, the caff'll
be closed... permanently.

196
00:12:50,567 --> 00:12:52,287
Are you sure it isn't true, though?

197
00:12:52,287 --> 00:12:55,006
When I talked to Liberty yesterday,
she was really defensive,

198
00:12:55,006 --> 00:12:57,447
like she was hiding something.

199
00:12:57,447 --> 00:13:00,767
She was probably just upset.
Wouldn't you be?

200
00:13:00,767 --> 00:13:02,366
Yeah, I would.

201
00:13:02,366 --> 00:13:05,246
Poor girl.
Who would spread a rumour like that?

202
00:13:05,246 --> 00:13:06,807
That's what I'm trying to figure out.

203
00:13:06,807 --> 00:13:08,285
Who did you hear it from, Ashley?

204
00:13:09,846 --> 00:13:12,884
It was Jimmy.
But he heard it from Spinner.

205
00:13:14,047 --> 00:13:16,326
Hey. It wasn't me who started it.

206
00:13:16,326 --> 00:13:18,407
Talk to this guy.
Sean?!

207
00:13:18,407 --> 00:13:20,767
What?
He's the one who told me.

208
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,447
About Coach Armstrong and Liberty?

209
00:13:22,447 --> 00:13:24,006
Oh, man. That's just sick!

210
00:13:24,006 --> 00:13:25,485
It's not true, Sean.

211
00:13:26,567 --> 00:13:28,726
It isn't?
No.

212
00:13:28,726 --> 00:13:31,846
Man! I knew it sounded fake.

213
00:13:31,846 --> 00:13:33,726
I should've never believed her.

214
00:13:33,726 --> 00:13:35,284
Believed who?

215
00:13:36,846 --> 00:13:39,086
I'm innocent. Talk to Paige.

216
00:13:41,846 --> 00:13:44,126
I was merely imparting information.

217
00:13:44,126 --> 00:13:46,326
And besides, I heard it from Terri.

218
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:47,918
She's the one you need to speak to.

219
00:13:55,326 --> 00:13:56,807
I need to talk to you.

220
00:13:56,807 --> 00:13:58,287
OK.

221
00:13:58,287 --> 00:14:00,527
The whole school's gossiping
about Liberty and Armstrong.

222
00:14:00,527 --> 00:14:02,407
Oh, no kidding. I have ears too.

223
00:14:02,407 --> 00:14:04,486
Well, it's not true.
It's just a rumour.

224
00:14:04,486 --> 00:14:06,567
Paige spread it around,
but she heard it from you.

225
00:14:06,567 --> 00:14:08,527
I swore her to secrecy.

226
00:14:08,527 --> 00:14:11,407
As if she'd keep quiet!
Paige lives for rumours.

227
00:14:11,407 --> 00:14:13,527
I was upset, OK? I was shocked.

228
00:14:13,527 --> 00:14:16,006
I had to tell someone. I'm sorry.

229
00:14:16,006 --> 00:14:17,886
Well, too late. I hope you're happy.

230
00:14:17,886 --> 00:14:19,447
Me?
Hello!

231
00:14:19,447 --> 00:14:21,086
You're the one
who started the rumour.

232
00:14:21,086 --> 00:14:22,687
I hate to tell you, but no.

233
00:14:22,687 --> 00:14:24,366
It was right here yesterday.

234
00:14:24,366 --> 00:14:27,167
You were talking to Manny about
Liberty and Armstrong, remember?

235
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:29,123
You started the rumour, Emma.

236
00:14:33,366 --> 00:14:35,562
Spin, are you sure
you want to do this?

237
00:14:36,567 --> 00:14:38,086
Don't you think it's a bit drastic?

238
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:42,763
Nope. All is fair in love and war.
And, dude, this is war.

239
00:14:48,486 --> 00:14:50,366
You're eating
the cafeteria food again?

240
00:14:50,366 --> 00:14:54,407
I decided to be, you know, mature.

241
00:14:54,407 --> 00:14:57,047
I probably never even saw that bug.

242
00:14:57,047 --> 00:14:59,126
Good for you, Spinner.

243
00:14:59,126 --> 00:15:00,798
Jimmy, can you pass me the pepper?

244
00:15:07,287 --> 00:15:08,765
Thanks.

245
00:15:10,886 --> 00:15:12,365
What are you smiling at?

246
00:15:16,846 --> 00:15:18,047
Oh!

247
00:15:18,047 --> 00:15:19,846
You put bugs on <i>her</i> tray?!

248
00:15:19,846 --> 00:15:22,807
Nobody believes me,
but they'll believe her.

249
00:15:22,807 --> 00:15:24,527
Oh, Spinner, you idiot!

250
00:15:24,527 --> 00:15:28,326
Ash, calm down. I told you...
there's bugs in the food.

251
00:15:28,326 --> 00:15:30,044
Because you put them there.

252
00:15:31,246 --> 00:15:32,725
What's in that container?

253
00:15:33,726 --> 00:15:35,206
Nothing.

254
00:15:38,287 --> 00:15:39,765
Ugh!

255
00:15:43,527 --> 00:15:45,518
Gavin,
what is going on here?!

256
00:15:52,366 --> 00:15:55,836
Math class.
I've been dreading this all day.

257
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,764
So, did you track down the rumour?

258
00:16:10,606 --> 00:16:13,366
Yeah. But I need
to say something to you first.

259
00:16:16,567 --> 00:16:19,246
OK. Today we're going
to be working on equations.

260
00:16:19,246 --> 00:16:22,927
Now, in dealing with equations,
we always use the BEDMAS rule.

261
00:16:22,927 --> 00:16:24,758
Now, who can tell me
what that stands for?

262
00:16:29,206 --> 00:16:30,798
What's with everyone today?

263
00:16:36,326 --> 00:16:39,407
OK. Why don't you tell us, Liberty?
You and I have been working on it.

264
00:16:49,527 --> 00:16:51,005
What is so funny?

265
00:16:52,687 --> 00:16:54,165
That's enough.

266
00:16:55,886 --> 00:16:57,886
Mr Armstrong, could I have
five minutes of your time?

267
00:16:57,886 --> 00:16:59,726
I was just about
to get started here.

268
00:16:59,726 --> 00:17:01,842
Mrs Smith will take over the class.

269
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:07,126
Right. Uh, OK.

270
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:09,606
Uh, class, I want you to begin
working on

271
00:17:09,606 --> 00:17:13,042
the order of operations exercises,
on page 129.

272
00:17:16,487 --> 00:17:18,364
Liberty, would you join us, please?

273
00:17:46,646 --> 00:17:48,204
What are you doing here?

274
00:17:49,207 --> 00:17:51,166
Emma, go back to class.

275
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:53,606
I need to talk to you, Mr Raditch.

276
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:56,207
Well, it'll have to wait. I'm in
the middle of something right now.

277
00:17:56,207 --> 00:17:57,686
It can't wait.

278
00:17:57,686 --> 00:17:59,165
You see...

279
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:02,118
...I'm in the middle of it too.

280
00:18:09,527 --> 00:18:11,007
You'll help me serve at every lunch

281
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:13,326
and then after school
you can help me clean up.

282
00:18:14,807 --> 00:18:18,287
Oh, and, uh, don't forget about this.

283
00:18:18,287 --> 00:18:20,967
I'm not wearing that.

284
00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:23,727
Health regulations, princess.

285
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:25,797
You do know about health regulations?

286
00:18:35,646 --> 00:18:37,886
Hey, Spin. How long are you...

287
00:18:40,326 --> 00:18:43,762
Nice net, Spinner.

288
00:18:48,606 --> 00:18:52,122
Oh, cheer up. It won't be for long...
only for about two months.

289
00:18:53,207 --> 00:18:54,686
Two months?

290
00:18:54,686 --> 00:18:56,527
You owe the school $300.

291
00:18:56,527 --> 00:18:59,007
That's what it'll cost
to exterminate the cafeteria.

292
00:18:59,007 --> 00:19:01,807
But the caff needed
to be exterminated anyway!

293
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:05,685
Sure it did, Gavin.
Sure it did.

294
00:19:10,446 --> 00:19:11,925
Liberty?

295
00:19:15,527 --> 00:19:17,006
I know you're in here.

296
00:19:19,086 --> 00:19:22,965
I <i>was</i> responsible for the rumour
starting, but I didn't spread it.

297
00:19:26,767 --> 00:19:28,886
And there's a difference?!

298
00:19:28,886 --> 00:19:31,846
You're lucky Mr Armstrong
didn't lose his job.

299
00:19:31,846 --> 00:19:33,926
And you know
what makes me really mad?

300
00:19:33,926 --> 00:19:35,967
That you thought I could do that!

301
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:37,719
Do what? Be violated?

302
00:19:39,086 --> 00:19:41,567
And what were you doing
with Mr Armstrong, anyway?

303
00:19:41,567 --> 00:19:43,406
He had his arm around you.

304
00:19:43,406 --> 00:19:45,125
Passed you a note.

305
00:19:46,846 --> 00:19:48,439
You want to see my note?

306
00:19:52,047 --> 00:19:53,886
"Dyscalculia'?

307
00:19:53,886 --> 00:19:57,596
It's a learning disorder,
like dyslexia, but with numbers.

308
00:19:58,646 --> 00:20:00,406
I've been really upset about it.

309
00:20:00,406 --> 00:20:02,203
Mr Armstrong's been helping me.

310
00:20:03,406 --> 00:20:05,126
So that's the explanation?

311
00:20:05,126 --> 00:20:07,003
Why didn't you say something?

312
00:20:10,406 --> 00:20:12,007
Because it means you're not perfect?

313
00:20:12,007 --> 00:20:13,767
Because it means I'm stupid!

314
00:20:13,767 --> 00:20:16,207
Stupid?! You're one of the
smartest kids in school!

315
00:20:16,207 --> 00:20:18,047
Not in math, I'm not.

316
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:20,247
Who cares?
I do!

317
00:20:20,247 --> 00:20:22,567
It's important to me to be the best.

318
00:20:22,567 --> 00:20:24,318
You don't understand.

319
00:20:26,527 --> 00:20:28,686
Liberty, I feel really bad.

320
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:31,567
Is there something
I can do... to help?

321
00:20:31,567 --> 00:20:35,406
No, Emma. Go back to saving
rainforests and whales.

322
00:20:35,406 --> 00:20:38,285
'Cause when it comes
to helping people, you suck.
