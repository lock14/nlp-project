TANGUS KINGDOM

3
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:17,845
The monk you sent
to find your wife is dead.

4
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:21,140
Did you hear?

5
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:50,545
When I was 9 years old...

6
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:54,090
...my father took me to the
Merkit clan to choose a bride.

7
00:02:57,052 --> 00:03:01,264
He stole my mother from the Merkits...

8
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:04,517
...and they never forgot it.

9
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:08,729
Now he needed peace...

10
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:12,942
...so I had to take a Merkit bride.

11
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:22,326
I couldn't say no to my father.

12
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,294
My friend Dai Sachen lives here.

13
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:34,797
Let's stop here for a night.

14
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:58,404
Welcome, my friend Esugei!

15
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:01,616
Good to see you.

16
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,244
Your son got big.

17
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:15,171
What's your name?

18
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:17,465
Temudgin.

19
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:20,301
It's me that should ask first.

20
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:25,848
How old are you?

21
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:28,976
Nine.

22
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,024
You're even younger than me.

23
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,026
By a lot?

24
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:39,570
By a whole year.

25
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,989
Why did you come here?

26
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:45,242
I'm going to the Merkits
to choose a bride.

27
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,078
I'm here for the night.

28
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:50,331
Smart people choose us for brides.

29
00:04:54,378 --> 00:04:56,045
Goodbye, Temudgin.

30
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:02,551
Wait. What's your name?

31
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:05,888
Borte. Temudgin.

32
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:09,517
You should choose me!

33
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:32,832
Let's fight, Targutai!

34
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,668
I'm drunk, you can beat me.

35
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:54,895
You're not just a fool, you're weak.

36
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:26,552
These mosquitoes are hungry.

37
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,013
I want to look for a bride here.

38
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:36,896
This clan's weak.

39
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:40,816
People come here for brides.

40
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:48,324
I must make peace with the Merkits.

41
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:51,994
I want to practice.

42
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:56,916
You can't just practice.
They'll be offended.

43
00:06:57,084 --> 00:07:00,669
If they're weak, let them be offended.

44
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,760
Listen carefully to what I tell you.

45
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:11,722
Don't make a mistake
when you choose a bride.

46
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:16,727
Her face has to be flat like a salt lake.

47
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:21,565
Her eyes have to be narrow.

48
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:25,277
Evil spirits dive into big eyes...

49
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,906
...and she will go mad...

50
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:35,037
...seeing things that aren't there.

51
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:41,085
And most important:

52
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:43,170
Don't forget to look at her legs.

53
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:46,048
A woman has to have strong legs...

54
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:48,968
...to make a man happy.

55
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:50,553
Understand?

56
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,582
I choose you.

57
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:22,585
I agree.

58
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:29,842
I have chosen my bride.

59
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:44,773
I'll give a sable coat for her.

60
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:49,195
Your son made a good choice,
Esugei.

61
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:54,283
For sure, he saved us time.

62
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:56,493
We can ride back home now.

63
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:58,245
You're right!

64
00:08:58,413 --> 00:09:01,957
For my clan, it is a great honor.

65
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:05,794
They can marry in five years.

66
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:13,594
This is a wishbone from a white raven.

67
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:18,307
Rub it and make your wish.

68
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:23,479
I'll be back in five years.

69
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:29,735
Why didn't you listen to me?

70
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:31,487
You're stubborn.

71
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:36,575
I saw her and I knew...

72
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:38,077
...she's my wife.

73
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:41,247
What will I say to the Merkits now?

74
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,707
My head hurts thinking about it.

75
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:46,585
Merkits will never forget this offense.

76
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:53,592
We rode back home.

77
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:57,763
My father didn't talk.

78
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:03,352
Finally he said to me:

79
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,020
"You did good.

80
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:08,649
A man has to choose his wife."

81
00:10:12,988 --> 00:10:16,031
I didn't know that day...

82
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:20,661
...would change my life forever.

83
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,352
Scared?

84
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:48,731
Yes.

85
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,233
Thunder means...

86
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:57,990
...our god Tengri is angry.

87
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:03,787
All Mongols are afraid of it.

88
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:26,935
Enemies.

89
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:28,604
So what?

90
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:31,065
You can't spill blood by a place of rest.

91
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:58,300
Accept this milk from my master.

92
00:11:58,468 --> 00:11:59,927
Thanks. Sit.

93
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:22,241
Thank you.

94
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:35,045
Esugei, let the servant drink it first.

95
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:37,506
See how they're looking at us.

96
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:42,511
They're our enemies.

97
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:46,515
But if I, Khan Esugei,
start breaking the customs...

98
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:51,562
...the world will turn upside down.

99
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,384
Are you sick, Esugei?

100
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:25,220
Let's stop.

101
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:28,182
Shut up! It's not for you to decide.

102
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,084
They've poisoned our khan!

103
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:07,095
You little bastard!

104
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,945
I'm leaving you, my son.

105
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:25,656
You'll be khan now.

106
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:28,867
Be strong...

107
00:14:29,244 --> 00:14:31,954
...and ask our lord
of the blue sky, great Tengri...

108
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,414
...to help you.

109
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,793
Take everything!

110
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:31,430
Don't you dare!

111
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:36,101
That's the herd of your khan.

112
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:39,521
He protected you!

113
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:42,149
Get away from there!

114
00:15:42,317 --> 00:15:45,527
Stop it!

115
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:56,204
You ungrateful piece of shit!

116
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,461
You're not afraid to steal, Targutai?

117
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:05,547
No. Khan Esugei is dead.

118
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:11,720
My son is khan now. He'll avenge us!

119
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:18,560
You want me to kill him?

120
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,193
Run! Quick!

121
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:27,569
Catch him!

122
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:28,945
Run!

123
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:45,087
You have the devil in you!

124
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:46,880
Targutai!

125
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:53,095
What's come over you?

126
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,347
Mongols don't kill children!

127
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,982
I curse you.

128
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:10,987
Rot in hell!

129
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:18,620
As Esugei said:

130
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:22,290
Never break the customs,
even if you want to.

131
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:27,629
When he grows up, I'll kill him.

132
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:50,736
He will grow up soon.

133
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:53,697
We'll come after him in the winter.

134
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:06,877
Someday...

135
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:10,046
...you'll have to kill him.

136
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:18,597
But save yourself first.

137
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:33,528
That winter, I had no place to hide.

138
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:43,205
I went to the sacred mountain...

139
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:46,500
...to ask our god Tengri to help me.

140
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:51,421
I was on my own.

141
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:55,884
The mountain was far away.

142
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:59,304
And I ran for my life.

143
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:04,494
Hey!

144
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,336
I'm Jamukha.

145
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:14,963
What's your name?

146
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,925
My name is Temudgin.

147
00:20:29,312 --> 00:20:31,104
A Mongol has to be on a horse.

148
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:34,149
My enemy Targutai took all our horses.

149
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:47,454
You helped me, Jamukha.

150
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:50,457
Will you be my brother?

151
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:32,958
Taichar, give me a rag.

152
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:46,888
We're blood brothers now.

153
00:21:47,098 --> 00:21:49,891
When I become khan, I'll
make you my second-in-command.

154
00:21:50,685 --> 00:21:52,811
Jamukha...

155
00:21:53,062 --> 00:21:56,481
...I must kill my enemy, Targutai, first.

156
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:59,943
How can you? You have no horse.

157
00:22:07,118 --> 00:22:09,619
My bride has strong legs.

158
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:16,292
Who cares about legs?

159
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:24,426
My father said it makes a man happy.

160
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:29,264
You need a horse more than a woman.

161
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,331
Run!

162
00:23:49,804 --> 00:23:51,179
Targutai!

163
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:59,437
Tell people I don't want to be khan.

164
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:01,856
You're a dog.

165
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:04,150
Nobody cares about you anymore.

166
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:08,029
Why do you still want to kill me?

167
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:10,198
I'll sleep better.

168
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:14,035
I'll kill you!

169
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:19,082
I'll kill you first.

170
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,417
Bastard!

171
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:47,902
You need to be strong. Eat.

172
00:24:51,574 --> 00:24:53,408
Drink.

173
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:04,419
These flies...

174
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:07,672
...suck your blood.

175
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:14,929
Temudgin!

176
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:16,389
Your family is safe.

177
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:19,767
Don't worry.

178
00:25:23,731 --> 00:25:26,149
Jamukha. Find my bride.

179
00:25:26,317 --> 00:25:29,402
Tell her to wait for me.

180
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:35,533
He's still short.

181
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:37,785
Feed him more.

182
00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:39,787
When I get back...

183
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:43,458
...I want him grown.

184
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:13,047
Great Tengri, lord of the blue sky.

185
00:27:13,215 --> 00:27:15,091
I bow before you.

186
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:18,052
Free me, great Tengri.

187
00:29:54,585 --> 00:30:00,131
No matter how far the wolf runs...

188
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,633
...he comes home one day.

189
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:27,742
Temudgin.

190
00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:36,584
I've been waiting for you.

191
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:40,421
I'm khan now.

192
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:44,967
I'm smarter than your father.

193
00:30:45,135 --> 00:30:46,511
He was a fool.

194
00:30:47,888 --> 00:30:49,055
You call yourself khan?

195
00:30:51,517 --> 00:30:54,352
Shit is always shit.

196
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:59,065
I won't just kill you.

197
00:30:59,233 --> 00:31:02,568
I'll kill you piece by piece.

198
00:31:07,449 --> 00:31:09,116
You see the wooden donkey?

199
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:13,955
I'll nail you to it myself!

200
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:17,458
It takes a week to die!

201
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:41,482
Come closer, old man.

202
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:52,118
You scare me.

203
00:31:56,999 --> 00:31:58,624
If I don't die...

204
00:31:58,792 --> 00:32:00,835
...I'll forgive all of you.

205
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:06,674
You won't forgive any of us.

206
00:32:31,617 --> 00:32:33,200
Come here.

207
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:35,369
Give me water.

208
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:40,291
You idiot.

209
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:42,501
Shut up!

210
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:47,715
I'll show you who's an idiot.

211
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:46,440
Don't move!

212
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:01,372
I'm Temudgin.

213
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,832
I'm Boorchu.

214
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:05,126
Why are you helping me?

215
00:34:06,253 --> 00:34:10,214
I know who you are. Take my horse.

216
00:34:14,428 --> 00:34:16,637
I won't forget you, Boorchu.

217
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:49,044
Great Tengri watched over me
and I survived.

218
00:34:51,548 --> 00:34:54,925
I was ready to face my enemies...

219
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:59,847
...and take back what was mine.

220
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:07,521
But first I had to find my bride, Borte.

221
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:20,242
I thought you were dead.

222
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:22,203
I'm not.

223
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,789
You know why I came.

224
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:29,627
You chose her years ago.

225
00:35:29,795 --> 00:35:32,213
I don't know...

226
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:35,049
...if Borte still wants you.

227
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:52,817
My Temudgin came back.

228
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:56,028
Father...

229
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:59,073
...I have to go with Temudgin.

230
00:36:04,746 --> 00:36:08,165
Bring the sable coat. Quick.

231
00:36:46,288 --> 00:36:48,622
Don't you want to touch me,
Temudgin?

232
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:53,419
My touch will break you in two.

233
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:07,808
My son.

234
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:10,644
Temudgin.

235
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:25,117
I like you.

236
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:29,830
You're strong, like me.

237
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:35,127
You're good.

238
00:37:42,594 --> 00:37:44,970
This is my dowry. Take it.

239
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:50,100
For me.

240
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:51,518
It's too much.

241
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:03,030
This is for you.

242
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:25,219
Brother, when will you put up your yurt?

243
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:27,638
Tomorrow.

244
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:31,809
It's good to have our brother back.

245
00:38:31,977 --> 00:38:34,436
And with such a beautiful wife.

246
00:39:02,257 --> 00:39:03,549
I caught you.

247
00:39:03,717 --> 00:39:06,135
Only because I let you.

248
00:39:08,805 --> 00:39:11,015
I'll make a good wife.

249
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:13,142
I know.

250
00:39:21,276 --> 00:39:22,735
Stay here!

251
00:39:23,445 --> 00:39:25,529
Oelun!

252
00:39:26,406 --> 00:39:28,407
Oelun!

253
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:31,118
Oelun!

254
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,123
Chiledu?

255
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,001
You remember my voice?

256
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:43,630
A woman never forgets her first husband.

257
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:47,009
Get down. I want to see your face.

258
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:52,264
Why should I look at you,
old woman?

259
00:39:52,432 --> 00:39:54,266
I want Temudgin's bride.

260
00:39:54,768 --> 00:39:57,061
Get out of here. Leave us alone!

261
00:39:58,104 --> 00:39:59,396
They're not here!

262
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:01,106
Go!

263
00:40:01,274 --> 00:40:03,025
Shut up!

264
00:40:21,336 --> 00:40:23,420
Khasar, watch out!

265
00:40:28,718 --> 00:40:30,385
Where are they?

266
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:32,346
Speak!

267
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:36,225
I found their tracks.

268
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:38,060
Let's go!

269
00:40:45,527 --> 00:40:49,696
Temudgin, I waited so long for you.

270
00:40:51,074 --> 00:40:53,367
I rubbed this wishbone
so many times.

271
00:40:53,535 --> 00:40:55,536
I had only one wish.

272
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:58,205
That you would come back.

273
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:05,671
I always want to be with you, Temudgin.

274
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:08,715
I promise.

275
00:41:17,142 --> 00:41:18,684
Merkits.

276
00:43:03,206 --> 00:43:05,207
Go home!

277
00:43:55,508 --> 00:43:57,843
When Temudgin's father...

278
00:43:58,011 --> 00:44:01,138
...stole my bride...

279
00:44:01,306 --> 00:44:03,307
...I swore revenge.

280
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:06,643
You're mine now.

281
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:08,437
Take her!

282
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:23,952
My son.

283
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,873
My brother.

284
00:44:36,591 --> 00:44:39,468
What did they do to you?

285
00:45:04,786 --> 00:45:07,287
How are you, Jamukha, my brother?

286
00:45:16,381 --> 00:45:19,049
I'm glad you're alive, brother.

287
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:22,636
Accept my gift, brother.

288
00:45:46,411 --> 00:45:52,249
When I heard that the Merkits
had stolen your wife...

289
00:45:52,792 --> 00:45:55,794
...my liver began to ache.

290
00:45:56,838 --> 00:45:59,256
I want to talk to you.

291
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:11,101
Mongols don't make war over a woman.

292
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:17,190
I'll tell Taichar now and
he'll bring you two new wives.

293
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:21,903
I want Borte back.

294
00:46:24,866 --> 00:46:29,995
Temudgin, have you
never tried another one?

295
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:34,749
And you think she's the only one
with strong legs?

296
00:46:40,131 --> 00:46:41,548
My time is short.

297
00:46:55,897 --> 00:46:57,105
Say welcome.

298
00:47:03,112 --> 00:47:04,738
Taichar...

299
00:47:05,615 --> 00:47:07,824
...Merkits have offended my brother.

300
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:22,756
How many warriors can you bring?

301
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:27,385
I have my sword and some people.

302
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:31,097
That's not enough, brother.

303
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:34,476
That's why I came to you.

304
00:48:03,172 --> 00:48:05,215
I'll do it.

305
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:10,136
Next year.

306
00:48:11,222 --> 00:48:13,890
That's too late.

307
00:48:16,811 --> 00:48:19,354
Next year's better.

308
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:21,314
We wait.

309
00:48:29,699 --> 00:48:33,827
Don't tell anyone we went to war
over a woman.

310
00:48:55,391 --> 00:48:56,975
This is Merkit territory.

311
00:52:07,041 --> 00:52:08,124
Who the hell are you?

312
00:53:23,784 --> 00:53:26,160
I knew you would come for me.

313
00:53:32,001 --> 00:53:35,962
Borte, I can't stay away from you.

314
00:53:49,143 --> 00:53:51,227
This is my son.

315
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:07,076
I see.

316
00:54:52,414 --> 00:54:55,291
Are you happy to have your wife back?

317
00:55:01,382 --> 00:55:05,385
I wouldn't sleep with such a woman.

318
00:55:11,475 --> 00:55:13,643
You're brave.

319
00:55:17,189 --> 00:55:18,773
Very brave!

320
00:55:31,954 --> 00:55:34,497
I want to thank you, brother.

321
00:55:35,874 --> 00:55:38,918
You'll stay with me now.

322
00:55:39,837 --> 00:55:43,589
I'm used to being my own master.

323
00:55:46,552 --> 00:55:48,678
You don't know Mongols.

324
00:55:48,846 --> 00:55:52,098
You won't survive on your own.

325
00:55:52,266 --> 00:55:57,353
You'll be my second-in-command.

326
00:55:58,772 --> 00:56:00,940
Temudgin, your people are waiting.

327
00:56:02,568 --> 00:56:03,568
I have to go.

328
00:56:03,736 --> 00:56:06,112
Go.

329
00:56:17,499 --> 00:56:21,586
Temudgin, I grabbed
the best sword for you.

330
00:56:24,465 --> 00:56:26,299
Jamukha took most of the plunder.

331
00:56:26,467 --> 00:56:28,760
Tell us how to divide what's left.

332
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:36,726
I'll take a tenth portion.

333
00:56:36,894 --> 00:56:39,228
Divide the rest between the warriors.

334
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:41,814
Don't forget the families
of the warriors who died.

335
00:56:44,443 --> 00:56:45,818
This is for you.

336
00:56:47,488 --> 00:56:49,697
Thank you, Temudgin.

337
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:55,328
Listen, everyone.
Temudgin is generous to us.

338
00:57:01,085 --> 00:57:04,003
Everyone gets their share.

339
00:57:09,968 --> 00:57:11,761
Look at him.

340
00:57:11,929 --> 00:57:15,056
He gave away all his plunder.

341
00:57:16,892 --> 00:57:18,559
Next time he'll take it all.

342
00:57:18,727 --> 00:57:21,979
He's taking a Merkit child into his yurt.

343
00:57:23,816 --> 00:57:25,691
Don't speak ill of my brother.

344
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:29,028
What brother is he to you?
I'm your brother.

345
00:58:55,073 --> 00:59:01,204
You can't cook two ram heads
in one pot...

346
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:02,997
...Temudgin.

347
00:59:11,048 --> 00:59:12,798
Wake up.

348
00:59:23,685 --> 00:59:27,146
My brother left me.

349
00:59:28,148 --> 00:59:31,234
He's stubborn.

350
00:59:37,074 --> 00:59:38,658
Get up!

351
00:59:41,370 --> 00:59:42,870
Daritai!

352
00:59:43,038 --> 00:59:44,997
Altan!

353
00:59:50,003 --> 00:59:51,837
Daritai!

354
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:56,634
Taichar.

355
00:59:59,513 --> 01:00:01,305
Where's Daritai?

356
01:00:01,515 --> 01:00:03,391
Where's Altan?

357
01:00:04,101 --> 01:00:09,188
They should be close to my boots.

358
01:00:10,232 --> 01:00:12,525
They left with Temudgin.

359
01:00:15,112 --> 01:00:16,737
What?

360
01:00:18,490 --> 01:00:21,200
They left with Temudgin.

361
01:00:53,317 --> 01:00:54,358
Brother.

362
01:00:56,236 --> 01:00:58,904
You didn't say goodbye to me.

363
01:00:59,448 --> 01:01:02,533
You were sleeping, brother.

364
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:08,789
My people are with you now.
Why, brother?

365
01:01:11,585 --> 01:01:16,005
Mongols change their masters
when they want to.

366
01:01:21,845 --> 01:01:23,471
Daritai.

367
01:01:23,722 --> 01:01:25,431
Altan.

368
01:01:26,183 --> 01:01:28,726
Why have you deserted me?

369
01:01:29,561 --> 01:01:31,354
Temudgin...

370
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:33,064
...is fair to his warriors.

371
01:01:33,231 --> 01:01:35,107
Give us back our horses!

372
01:01:35,275 --> 01:01:37,777
You gave me this horse, so it's mine.

373
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:44,241
Daritai, I'm the law.

374
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:48,287
I'll tear your rotting liver out.

375
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:51,248
Try.

376
01:01:52,459 --> 01:01:53,501
My liver...

377
01:01:55,045 --> 01:01:56,420
...has a new master now!

378
01:02:10,477 --> 01:02:13,104
I can't send them back to you, brother.

379
01:02:13,271 --> 01:02:15,981
Mongols have the right to choose.

380
01:02:41,299 --> 01:02:44,593
Look after our horse. I'll be back!

381
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:59,775
Daritai! Thieves are stealing
Temudgin's horses!

382
01:03:50,243 --> 01:03:54,246
Jamukha's people
tried to steal your horses.

383
01:03:57,667 --> 01:04:02,463
We killed one of them.

384
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:05,382
One less thief.

385
01:04:09,429 --> 01:04:12,264
We killed Jamukha's brother.

386
01:04:13,016 --> 01:04:14,767
Taichar.

387
01:04:16,311 --> 01:04:18,187
Who killed him?

388
01:04:20,607 --> 01:04:21,941
I did.

389
01:04:22,108 --> 01:04:24,902
I didn't recognize him.

390
01:04:25,070 --> 01:04:28,489
You saved the horses...

391
01:04:28,657 --> 01:04:30,282
...but you brought us war.

392
01:04:31,618 --> 01:04:34,411
Forgive me, lord.

393
01:04:34,704 --> 01:04:37,790
Send my head to Jamukha.

394
01:04:48,802 --> 01:04:51,762
He guarded your herd well.

395
01:04:52,597 --> 01:04:56,934
If you hand him over,
what will people say?

396
01:05:31,303 --> 01:05:35,514
I've heard of your sorrow,
Jamukha.

397
01:05:43,732 --> 01:05:48,444
I'll help you get revenge.

398
01:05:58,663 --> 01:06:02,833
I want to tie Temudgin's head
to the tail of my horse.

399
01:06:03,001 --> 01:06:05,044
Do it.

400
01:06:11,051 --> 01:06:12,885
Without you...

401
01:06:14,012 --> 01:06:15,387
...I can't.

402
01:06:23,521 --> 01:06:25,272
Are you afraid, Targutai?

403
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:35,199
What kind of khan are you?

404
01:06:37,077 --> 01:06:42,706
There are only two strong Mongols
in the steppe.

405
01:06:42,874 --> 01:06:44,792
Me...

406
01:06:44,959 --> 01:06:46,418
...and my brother Temudgin.

407
01:06:49,089 --> 01:06:50,547
Understand?

408
01:06:52,842 --> 01:06:56,595
I'll bring all my horsemen.
Give me Temudgin!

409
01:07:47,397 --> 01:07:49,982
Temudgin, Jamukha
is following your tracks.

410
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:53,944
There will be 10 of them
for each of us.

411
01:07:54,112 --> 01:07:56,238
Tell us what to do.

412
01:07:56,823 --> 01:07:58,699
I won't leave our families behind.

413
01:07:58,867 --> 01:08:02,578
If we save ourselves,
we can come back for them.

414
01:08:02,746 --> 01:08:03,829
It's the only way.

415
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:10,335
Altan, Daritai. You trusted me
with your families.

416
01:08:10,754 --> 01:08:13,005
Jamukha will show them no mercy.

417
01:08:13,506 --> 01:08:16,425
Are you ready to abandon them?

418
01:08:19,763 --> 01:08:21,805
You decide, Temudgin.

419
01:08:24,517 --> 01:08:25,684
Temudgin.

420
01:08:27,145 --> 01:08:29,229
Leave us.

421
01:08:29,397 --> 01:08:30,773
Save yourself.

422
01:08:33,818 --> 01:08:36,153
Do as all Mongols do.

423
01:08:36,321 --> 01:08:38,864
Everyone will understand.

424
01:08:39,741 --> 01:08:41,450
Not me.

425
01:08:51,544 --> 01:08:53,212
Go to the mountains, quick!

426
01:09:04,307 --> 01:09:08,185
Let's move, Jamukha.
What are you waiting for?

427
01:09:08,353 --> 01:09:10,729
What's the rush, Targutai?

428
01:09:11,689 --> 01:09:15,734
Temudgin will run away.
We'll never find him.

429
01:09:18,905 --> 01:09:23,325
You don't know my brother.

430
01:09:45,098 --> 01:09:47,432
-Are you ready?
-Ready, Temudgin.

431
01:09:59,612 --> 01:10:01,071
Khasar.

432
01:10:02,699 --> 01:10:06,368
Take enough men
to protect our families.

433
01:10:42,447 --> 01:10:45,616
Temudgin, we're staying with you.

434
01:11:04,302 --> 01:11:05,344
It's time to go.

435
01:11:08,306 --> 01:11:10,724
Look after yourself and our son.

436
01:11:11,559 --> 01:11:13,810
Stay alive, Temudgin.

437
01:11:28,618 --> 01:11:29,910
Don't forget us.

438
01:12:37,437 --> 01:12:40,272
You see how smart my brother is?

439
01:12:40,732 --> 01:12:43,316
It won't be easy to take him.

440
01:12:58,875 --> 01:13:00,959
Attack!

441
01:14:52,822 --> 01:14:56,741
I want Temudgin alive.

442
01:14:59,495 --> 01:15:01,163
Me too.

443
01:15:57,511 --> 01:16:00,931
You promised, he's mine.

444
01:16:02,016 --> 01:16:05,518
Everything here is mine, Targutai.

445
01:16:06,062 --> 01:16:08,605
And you're mine too.

446
01:16:40,263 --> 01:16:42,264
You say nothing.

447
01:16:48,312 --> 01:16:50,772
At least beg me for mercy.

448
01:16:53,693 --> 01:16:57,153
You want to die, Temudgin?

449
01:17:02,451 --> 01:17:07,998
I'm not a beggar, brother.

450
01:17:12,586 --> 01:17:15,422
Beg me for your life.

451
01:17:18,592 --> 01:17:20,552
I can't.

452
01:17:24,932 --> 01:17:27,058
I'm asking you.

453
01:17:31,230 --> 01:17:33,773
Forgive me, brother.

454
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:40,071
I'm not your brother.

455
01:17:42,408 --> 01:17:44,743
I'm your khan.

456
01:17:51,208 --> 01:17:54,669
And you are my slave!

457
01:17:57,757 --> 01:17:59,257
Take him.

458
01:18:27,995 --> 01:18:29,788
Hold on.

459
01:18:38,464 --> 01:18:40,382
I can't go on.

460
01:18:42,551 --> 01:18:47,305
Forgive me, I lost the battle.

461
01:18:49,892 --> 01:18:52,185
You fought well.

462
01:18:52,353 --> 01:18:56,272
You saved our families.

463
01:18:56,440 --> 01:19:00,318
Now Mongols know your name,
Temudgin.

464
01:19:28,055 --> 01:19:29,931
Get up.

465
01:19:33,269 --> 01:19:34,519
Go! Push!

466
01:19:37,857 --> 01:19:40,150
I'm finished.

467
01:20:21,817 --> 01:20:23,735
How are you, garrison chief?

468
01:20:23,903 --> 01:20:25,528
Stop here.

469
01:20:27,114 --> 01:20:29,240
Want to buy slaves?

470
01:20:30,075 --> 01:20:31,409
How much?

471
01:20:32,703 --> 01:20:34,871
One rope of Tangut money.

472
01:20:35,039 --> 01:20:36,748
That one is two.

473
01:20:41,253 --> 01:20:42,587
And that one...

474
01:20:46,091 --> 01:20:47,759
...five ropes.

475
01:20:49,470 --> 01:20:51,346
Too high. Three.

476
01:20:53,140 --> 01:20:54,807
I can't go lower.

477
01:20:54,975 --> 01:20:58,937
This one killed my best guard.

478
01:20:59,897 --> 01:21:03,066
Don't buy that one.
He will bring sorrow upon us.

479
01:21:03,234 --> 01:21:07,278
What sorrow can a slave bring?
We have thousands of them.

480
01:21:10,574 --> 01:21:14,285
He'll never forgive
the humiliation. Let him go.

481
01:21:14,453 --> 01:21:16,120
Foolish talk, old monk.

482
01:21:17,206 --> 01:21:21,709
He's a slave, and he'll die a slave.

483
01:21:23,045 --> 01:21:26,130
I see hordes of Mongol horsemen...

484
01:21:26,298 --> 01:21:31,052
...ravaging your land, death.

485
01:21:35,891 --> 01:21:37,642
Hey, Mongol.

486
01:21:38,394 --> 01:21:40,853
You want to destroy my kingdom?

487
01:21:49,488 --> 01:21:53,032
I know what to do with him.

488
01:22:30,821 --> 01:22:34,115
I haven't been paid in months.

489
01:22:37,995 --> 01:22:39,078
Listen.

490
01:22:39,246 --> 01:22:41,372
Let's sell the beast.

491
01:22:44,627 --> 01:22:46,711
Who'd buy him?

492
01:23:14,740 --> 01:23:18,076
Hey, Mongol! Show us your teeth.

493
01:23:18,243 --> 01:23:24,165
MONGOL WHO WANTED
TO DESTROY TANGUT KINGDOM

494
01:23:46,689 --> 01:23:50,817
Forgive us.

495
01:24:01,328 --> 01:24:05,289
Mongols die in cages.

496
01:24:06,709 --> 01:24:09,460
I'm alive.

497
01:24:10,713 --> 01:24:13,005
Your spirit is strong.

498
01:24:14,049 --> 01:24:16,843
I am here to ask you...

499
01:24:17,010 --> 01:24:19,971
...when the terrible time comes...

500
01:24:20,806 --> 01:24:23,766
...do not destroy our monastery.

501
01:24:25,978 --> 01:24:29,355
Kill the guard tonight...

502
01:24:29,523 --> 01:24:33,401
...bring me the key.

503
01:24:34,486 --> 01:24:38,364
My faith does not allow me to kill.

504
01:24:38,991 --> 01:24:41,617
My faith does.

505
01:24:43,620 --> 01:24:47,039
The monastery has many sacred books.

506
01:24:47,291 --> 01:24:49,751
They must be saved.

507
01:24:51,795 --> 01:24:53,880
I can't read.

508
01:24:58,844 --> 01:25:02,388
Go to the merchants
who trade with Mongols.

509
01:25:02,556 --> 01:25:05,683
Ask them to find Temudgin's clan
and give this bone to Borte.

510
01:25:08,854 --> 01:25:13,024
Remember, Borte.

511
01:25:21,825 --> 01:25:23,910
I'll do it.

512
01:25:25,954 --> 01:25:31,209
In Mongolia, everyone gets robbed.

513
01:25:31,543 --> 01:25:34,587
Among us merchants,
only Golden Earring goes there.

514
01:25:34,797 --> 01:25:36,881
But he's a thief himself.

515
01:25:37,841 --> 01:25:40,384
Nobody knows when he comes...

516
01:25:42,054 --> 01:25:47,433
...or when he goes.

517
01:25:47,684 --> 01:25:50,186
Nobody can help you, old monk.

518
01:27:37,294 --> 01:27:39,962
Juchi. Juchi.

519
01:27:40,631 --> 01:27:42,506
We must go.

520
01:29:07,342 --> 01:29:09,051
I know how to bury a monk.

521
01:29:18,395 --> 01:29:20,271
What are you waiting for?

522
01:29:20,814 --> 01:29:22,648
A caravan.

523
01:29:23,150 --> 01:29:25,776
I'm the last caravan...

524
01:29:26,403 --> 01:29:28,696
...and I won't be back soon.

525
01:29:38,790 --> 01:29:40,583
Take us with you now!

526
01:29:44,755 --> 01:29:46,005
It's a long road.

527
01:29:46,173 --> 01:29:47,840
I can see you have no money.

528
01:29:56,975 --> 01:29:58,309
How will you pay me?

529
01:29:58,477 --> 01:30:00,978
You know how I'll pay you.

530
01:32:58,990 --> 01:33:00,241
Not enough.

531
01:33:00,408 --> 01:33:01,492
We had a deal.

532
01:33:03,995 --> 01:33:06,163
He wants more.

533
01:33:06,331 --> 01:33:08,040
Or he'll tell on me.

534
01:33:08,458 --> 01:33:09,708
I haven't got any more.

535
01:33:13,630 --> 01:33:16,423
You don't look like a poor woman.

536
01:33:25,934 --> 01:33:28,018
I want to talk to you.

537
01:33:29,271 --> 01:33:31,855
Don't try to cross me.

538
01:33:34,901 --> 01:33:36,443
Give me the key.

539
01:34:59,736 --> 01:35:02,154
What's her name?

540
01:35:02,947 --> 01:35:04,281
Mongen.

541
01:35:08,703 --> 01:35:11,705
I am your father, Mongen.

542
01:35:17,712 --> 01:35:20,214
Where is my other father?

543
01:35:20,924 --> 01:35:22,049
Forget him.

544
01:35:22,217 --> 01:35:23,884
This is your father now.

545
01:36:46,593 --> 01:36:48,469
Go and sleep.

546
01:38:13,513 --> 01:38:16,598
Don't worry, he's our father.

547
01:39:30,548 --> 01:39:32,716
Do you want to play too?

548
01:39:43,728 --> 01:39:45,228
Father.

549
01:39:45,647 --> 01:39:48,440
Why don't you braid your hair?

550
01:39:49,067 --> 01:39:52,069
Shouldn't a man always braid his hair?

551
01:39:53,488 --> 01:39:55,739
Not me.

552
01:40:09,879 --> 01:40:11,171
We call this "meat."

553
01:40:11,339 --> 01:40:12,964
Meat.

554
01:40:19,430 --> 01:40:23,850
Our language is the most beautiful.

555
01:40:24,268 --> 01:40:28,814
Someday, everyone
will understand Mongol.

556
01:40:29,941 --> 01:40:32,859
Listen to how beautiful it sounds:

557
01:40:33,027 --> 01:40:34,653
Meat.

558
01:40:49,961 --> 01:40:52,587
Juchi, how old are you?

559
01:40:52,755 --> 01:40:54,005
Ten, Father.

560
01:40:54,424 --> 01:40:57,467
You must choose a bride soon.

561
01:40:59,303 --> 01:41:01,012
How do I choose?

562
01:41:02,140 --> 01:41:03,682
I will teach you...

563
01:41:03,850 --> 01:41:07,561
...because finding a good woman
is the hardest thing.

564
01:41:07,729 --> 01:41:09,146
I agree.

565
01:41:14,277 --> 01:41:16,695
I told you not to be scared.

566
01:41:16,863 --> 01:41:20,282
I'm not scared.
Our father is very funny.

567
01:41:28,791 --> 01:41:32,419
I have names for the sons
you will bear me.

568
01:41:35,465 --> 01:41:38,550
Don't you know
what Mongols are like?

569
01:41:40,219 --> 01:41:43,221
I'm Mongol. I know.

570
01:41:45,767 --> 01:41:47,642
They are worse than ever.

571
01:41:47,810 --> 01:41:49,811
All they do is kill and steal.

572
01:41:49,979 --> 01:41:52,773
They don't even spare the children.

573
01:42:05,620 --> 01:42:09,998
I know what to do with Mongols.

574
01:42:17,840 --> 01:42:20,717
Take the children and go home.

575
01:42:29,769 --> 01:42:31,228
When will you be back?

576
01:42:31,813 --> 01:42:32,979
A year?

577
01:42:33,147 --> 01:42:35,023
Two years?

578
01:42:43,825 --> 01:42:45,784
I won't see you soon, Temudgin.

579
01:43:24,448 --> 01:43:26,867
Lord of the blue sky, great Tengri.

580
01:43:27,034 --> 01:43:30,120
I bow before you.

581
01:43:30,288 --> 01:43:33,748
Give me the strength.

582
01:43:56,105 --> 01:43:58,440
Mongols need laws.

583
01:43:58,608 --> 01:44:01,109
I will make them obey...

584
01:44:01,736 --> 01:44:08,199
...even if I have to kill half of them.

585
01:44:19,962 --> 01:44:24,174
Our laws will be simple.

586
01:44:27,553 --> 01:44:33,475
Don't kill women or children.

587
01:44:33,643 --> 01:44:36,436
Don't forget your debts.

588
01:44:38,105 --> 01:44:41,191
Fight enemies to the end.

589
01:44:44,320 --> 01:44:47,948
And never betray your khan.

590
01:45:04,590 --> 01:45:09,469
Many warriors came under my banner.

591
01:45:11,514 --> 01:45:17,227
They knew I wanted to
unite all Mongols...

592
01:45:17,770 --> 01:45:20,271
...to make us strong.

593
01:45:25,820 --> 01:45:30,824
But Jamukha tried to tear us apart.

594
01:45:32,201 --> 01:45:33,910
The time came...

595
01:45:34,078 --> 01:45:37,038
...for our final battle to decide...

596
01:45:38,040 --> 01:45:40,834
...who would rule Mongolia.

597
01:45:51,512 --> 01:45:53,805
Jamukha's army was bigger.

598
01:45:54,682 --> 01:45:57,767
But I had my strategy...

599
01:45:57,935 --> 01:46:00,437
...and I knew how to win.

600
01:46:02,481 --> 01:46:04,441
I still needed Tengri...

601
01:46:04,608 --> 01:46:06,568
...lord of the blue sky...

602
01:46:09,405 --> 01:46:11,948
...to be on my side.

603
01:46:35,222 --> 01:46:39,642
My brother's warriors shoot well.

604
01:46:42,813 --> 01:46:45,648
Let's attack, Jamukha.

605
01:46:49,737 --> 01:46:51,654
My brother...

606
01:46:54,241 --> 01:46:57,077
...is crafty as a wolf.

607
01:47:03,584 --> 01:47:06,002
First detachment.

608
01:51:40,986 --> 01:51:42,236
Attack!

609
01:52:14,103 --> 01:52:15,812
Go!

610
01:54:32,032 --> 01:54:35,451
Temudgin.
We throw our khan at your feet.

611
01:54:35,994 --> 01:54:38,663
He tried to run, but we killed him.

612
01:54:39,706 --> 01:54:40,748
Who is this?

613
01:54:41,416 --> 01:54:43,626
Your enemy, Targutai.

614
01:54:54,721 --> 01:54:56,055
Kill them.

615
01:54:56,223 --> 01:54:57,515
For what?

616
01:55:01,395 --> 01:55:02,979
Altan!

617
01:55:03,146 --> 01:55:05,481
What did we do wrong?

618
01:55:05,649 --> 01:55:07,733
You broke the law.

619
01:55:07,901 --> 01:55:10,653
You betrayed your khan.

620
01:55:11,947 --> 01:55:14,490
We didn't know!

621
01:55:22,916 --> 01:55:25,459
How are you, old man?

622
01:55:26,295 --> 01:55:30,840
Thank you for remembering,
Khan Temudgin.

623
01:55:36,305 --> 01:55:39,640
Give him 100 horses
and put his yurt next to mine.

624
01:55:47,024 --> 01:55:48,899
Take all these men into my army.

625
01:55:52,195 --> 01:55:55,156
Temudgin. We caught him.

626
01:56:14,134 --> 01:56:15,176
Temudgin.

627
01:56:17,804 --> 01:56:20,097
Now you're khan and I'm at your feet.

628
01:56:21,558 --> 01:56:23,434
Are you happy?

629
01:56:33,111 --> 01:56:35,905
I forgive you, brother.

630
01:56:36,281 --> 01:56:38,240
It's too late.

631
01:56:42,245 --> 01:56:47,458
I'll always be a rock in your boot.

632
01:56:53,465 --> 01:56:55,466
I want to ask you:

633
01:56:55,634 --> 01:56:59,345
All Mongols fear the thunder...

634
01:57:01,640 --> 01:57:03,766
...but not you?

635
01:57:06,269 --> 01:57:11,482
I had no place to hide
from the thunder...

636
01:57:12,693 --> 01:57:17,405
...so I wasn't afraid anymore.

637
01:57:25,831 --> 01:57:31,961
What are you going to
do with me, Temudgin?

638
01:57:33,422 --> 01:57:37,967
What would you do?

639
01:57:40,303 --> 01:57:43,097
I would kill me, brother.

640
01:58:01,116 --> 01:58:02,825
Go.

641
01:58:13,420 --> 01:58:16,213
You're letting your enemy go.

642
01:58:19,217 --> 01:58:21,927
I'm letting my brother go.

643
01:58:31,980 --> 01:58:33,522
Father!

644
01:58:34,649 --> 01:58:37,276
When will we go to choose my bride?

645
01:58:37,444 --> 01:58:39,862
You must keep your promise.

646
01:58:41,156 --> 01:58:43,365
We'll go soon.

647
01:58:57,172 --> 01:58:59,632
See how well I chose your mother.

648
01:59:00,509 --> 01:59:02,843
Temudgin, I chose you.

649
01:59:11,019 --> 01:59:12,061
True!

650
01:59:36,878 --> 01:59:39,922
I have to finish what I started.

651
01:59:50,976 --> 01:59:53,644
You're a good wife, Borte.

652
02:00:06,700 --> 02:00:09,535
You know I'll always come back.

653
02:00:25,552 --> 02:00:26,594
Old man...

654
02:00:27,721 --> 02:00:29,805
...tell me, what's my future?

655
02:00:29,973 --> 02:00:32,057
Don't be afraid.

656
02:00:47,324 --> 02:00:53,329
You know your future, great khan.

657
02:05:32,984 --> 02:05:34,985
[ENGLISH]

658
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:38,106
