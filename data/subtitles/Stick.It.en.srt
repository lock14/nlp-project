1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
STICK IT (2006)

2
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:55,941
No. No, no. Sorry, bro.

3
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,671
<i>This casa's not su casa.
No way.</i>

4
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:01,976
- Get out.
- There's like six other empty pools.

5
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:04,573
- That aren't as deep.
- You're not that good.

6
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,350
Off this roof,

7
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,717
onto the slide

8
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:11,120
and into the pool stays.

9
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:21,723
- Let's do it, Cracker!
- Go, GC!

10
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:23,234
Yo, let me use your phone.

11
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:26,204
Why? It's gonna be done
by the time anyone gets here.

12
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:28,763
I'm not gonna call anyone.

13
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:31,332
I'm gonna take
some shots of the blood.

14
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:53,258
- Go.
- Come on, Cracker.

15
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,858
All right, you can do this!

16
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:19,652
Dude, that was insane!

17
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,006
You OK?

18
00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:42,876
Now the alarm goes off?

19
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:46,043
Guys, guys, guys, gots to go! Leave it!

20
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,180
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

21
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,635
<i>This isn't the first time</i>

22
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:11,540
<i>I've made out
with law enforcement.</i>

23
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:13,738
<i>We've kinda had
this ongoing flirtation.</i>

24
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:16,738
<i>We've been on some dates.</i>

25
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:19,080
<i>You know, broken up,
got back together.</i>

26
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,416
<i>But honestly, until now...</i>

27
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:25,255
<i>...I haven't been ready
for anything steady.</i>

28
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:29,691
<i>You're pushing it, Haley.</i>

29
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:32,492
<i>But, you know,
people change.</i>

30
00:05:32,565 --> 00:05:34,726
<i>And I felt like
maybe I was ready</i>

31
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:37,565
<i>for a more serious courtship.</i>

32
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,440
<i>Meet the court.</i>

33
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:48,344
It looks to be about, uh,
14,000 in property damage.

34
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:51,042
Haley, I assure you
that juvenile incarceration

35
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:52,709
is not as much fun
as it sounds.

36
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:55,276
So we're going to
give you one more chance.

37
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:58,017
Your father is willing
to subsidize two options...

38
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:00,218
- I'll take her.
- Over my dead body.

39
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:02,386
You dumped us, remember?

40
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:04,657
The Texas Military Academy

41
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:07,632
or a facility...

42
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,827
...called VGA.

43
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:13,303
Are you crazy?!
This is not OK. VGA?!

44
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,841
- Let me have custody, Your Honor.
- Alice!

45
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:17,876
All right, now stop this, both of you.

46
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:20,003
Haley, I leave it to you to decide.

47
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:21,512
Where would you like to go?

48
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:23,412
Texas Military Academy,
Your Honor.

49
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:25,348
- VGA it is.
- What?

50
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:28,785
<i>Meet my worst nightmare.</i>

51
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:32,154
Brice! VGA, are you crazy?
Don't do this to her!

52
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:37,992
So it's about a three-hour drive.

53
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,760
Take as much time as you need.

54
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:18,794
Where's my shit?

55
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:27,971
- Right there.
- So you're just dumping me?

56
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:30,481
Huh? Just giving up
and not even talking to me?

57
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:34,008
You're the one that gave up.
Guess you learned that from your mom.

58
00:07:35,254 --> 00:07:36,846
Don't send me to VGA.

59
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:39,187
And what do you think
I should do? Huh?

60
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,151
I don't know what
to do with you.

61
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,792
You used to be
such a good kid.

62
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,303
That's so interesting.

63
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:57,776
You used to be a good dad.

64
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:00,439
Guess we're even.

65
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:04,345
- Cracker!
- Cracker, wait up!

66
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:06,612
Aww.

67
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,519
I can't believe you didn't name names.

68
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,182
I would never do that to you guys.

69
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:14,488
- So, what happened?
- Yeah, where you goin'?

70
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,960
Uh... juvy.
Outside of Houston.

71
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:19,463
- Can we visit?
- Yeah, when you bust me out.

72
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:21,523
Know how I feel.
Consider it done.

73
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:23,159
Well done.
Charred to a crisp.

74
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:25,864
- OK, we have to go, guys.
- Wait, wait. Take my phone.

75
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:27,303
Use it if they don't take it.

76
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:29,534
- What'll you use?
- I'll steal my brother's.

77
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:31,543
I got really good shots of that jump.

78
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:34,375
- That shit was legendary.
- Off the hook!

79
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:36,714
Later, Cracker!

80
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:39,216
Yeah!

81
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:41,583
- Did you catch that?
- What?

82
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:43,918
That I'm totally
her favorite?

83
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:47,221
Dude, why do you always gotta
bite my moment? It taste good?

84
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:48,851
Delicious.

85
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:09,072
Anybody home?

86
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:11,412
Anybody care?

87
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:38,207
<i>VGA.</i>

88
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:41,542
<i>Otherwise known as the
Vickerman Gymnastics Academy.</i>

89
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:45,340
<i>There's only one thing worse</i>

90
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,352
<i>than having no control
over your life.</i>

91
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,446
<i>It's being forced to live it
with people who hate you.</i>

92
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:52,150
<i>And I was suddenly the filling</i>

93
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:54,317
<i>in the middle
of an "I hate you" sandwich.</i>

94
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:56,293
<i>Meet the bread.</i>

95
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:59,923
Ladies, read my mind.

96
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:02,092
Read my mind, ladies.

97
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:05,001
<i>Burt Vickerman used to
whip up the best gymnasts</i>

98
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:06,663
<i>west of the Mississippi.</i>

99
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:08,798
<i>That is, until his gym
starting producing</i>

100
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:11,274
<i>more injuries than champions.</i>

101
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:15,041
<i>We'd never met, and I'd been
hoping to keep it that way.</i>

102
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:17,275
Is my mind saying "relax"?

103
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:21,787
Maybe you can read my mind,
and it's completely lost.

104
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:23,378
Have I lost my mind?

105
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:26,118
Is that why you're
staring off into space?

106
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:28,626
Ah.

107
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:31,424
- Join us.
- What is she doing here?

108
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:33,722
<i>Joanne Charis.</i>

109
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:38,133
<i>Four-time national team member,
five-time national Haley-hater.</i>

110
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:40,900
<i>Why all the hate?</i>

111
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:44,568
<i>Well, when you walk out on Worlds
and lose Team USA some team gold,</i>

112
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,477
<i>it's not personal.
It's national.</i>

113
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:49,673
<i>And in the world of gymnastics,</i>

114
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:52,274
<i>hating me was practically a sport...</i>

115
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:53,818
<i>...in and of itself.</i>

116
00:10:53,886 --> 00:10:55,877
Everyone...

117
00:10:57,256 --> 00:11:01,192
...Haley Graham...
has very graciously

118
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:05,094
come out of retirement to join us.

119
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:10,124
Being out of shape isn't funny.
No making fun of her.

120
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:13,330
- Get dressed, Haley.
- Yeah, uh...

121
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:15,931
I accidentally burned
all my leotards last year.

122
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:17,373
Hope this is OK.

123
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:21,777
- You warmed up?
- What, to you? No.

124
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:28,318
Stretch and join vault rotation.
Let's see where you're at.

125
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,080
We're warmin' up Yurchenkos.

126
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:36,720
Super. I'm goin' for a "Butt-ahara. "

127
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:40,027
- You mean a Tsukahara?
- No. I mean a "Butt-ahara. "

128
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:07,552
Bing! Hm?

129
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:13,555
I know. My landing was a little off.

130
00:12:13,632 --> 00:12:17,363
Oh, no. Take a seat.

131
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:20,405
Just need to pick up
your run a little bit.

132
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:23,772
- Ivan can help you with that.
- Hmm?

133
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:27,470
Ivan.

134
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:38,348
Don't you dare fart.

135
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:42,258
Put me down, Shrek. Ow!

136
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:44,421
This isn't the real world.

137
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:48,564
This is my world.

138
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:51,102
You don't have to like me
or like it here.

139
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,297
But you do have to respect it.

140
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:59,939
Respect?
Is this how you respect people?

141
00:13:00,012 --> 00:13:03,880
You throw 'em over a shoulder
and violate their personal space?

142
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:06,474
Oh, goody.

143
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:09,043
I heard you were like this.
I'm so glad it's true.

144
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:11,521
What is it that you've
done to earn my respect?

145
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:14,491
We have rules.
We have rules for training.

146
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,549
Oh.

147
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,926
And the reason
that we have rules...

148
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:21,455
...and coaches is because
this is gymnastics.

149
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:23,297
Hey!

150
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,570
That was rude.

151
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,166
While danger and risk is the reality
of what we do, it's calculated.

152
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:33,507
Can't be calculated
if you don't respect the laws.

153
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:37,948
Uh-huh.

154
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:42,483
The laws of gravity,
for instance.

155
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,423
OK, what's your point?

156
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:49,018
Look, I want you
to be back here tomorrow

157
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:50,925
at 10am, ready to train.

158
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:54,989
Or we can call the judge,
and you can go to jail.

159
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:58,032
Hey, you decide.

160
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:02,233
Don't expect me to train.

161
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:05,004
- And lose the hat tomorrow.
- Lose the gum.

162
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:08,377
Good morning, ladies.

163
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:11,243
How's your neck?
Feeling better?

164
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:13,080
- It feels much better.
- Good, good.

165
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:15,017
Now, remember, stretch. Yeah?

166
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:17,588
'Morning, Haley.

167
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:19,681
- Hey.
- Be with you in a minute.

168
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:24,327
Now... Well, you know
about your daughter.

169
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:26,830
Your daughter is
the best one, I've gotta say.

170
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:29,367
I've never seen
anything quite like her.

171
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:32,165
We'd like to fast-track her
towards becoming an elite.

172
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:35,401
- That's 20 hours a week.
- Well, she's a star.

173
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:37,533
- She's six.
- Oh...

174
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:41,205
I've got two other kids.
That is a big commitment.

175
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:45,046
We'd have her nationally ranked
by the time she's ten.

176
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:48,018
Olympic track by age 13.
That's the gold.

177
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:52,285
- You mean the goal.
- Did I say gold?

178
00:14:54,493 --> 00:14:56,017
Well, you see?

179
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:59,462
I guess Madison and gold
are becoming synonymous for me.

180
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,632
- I'll have the check Tuesday.
- Wonderful.

181
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:07,695
Uh, yeah.

182
00:15:07,773 --> 00:15:10,139
You got a lot of people
going to the Olympics.

183
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:13,635
Just wondering, um, what country
are they gonna represent?

184
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:15,873
State of Delusion?

185
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:36,468
- Good, job, girls.
- I'm so hot. It's so hot outside.

186
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:40,403
Vick! When can we scrap
the old long-sleeve leotards?

187
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:42,633
We need new ones
for championships.

188
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:45,142
Every college will be scouting me.

189
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:49,646
Not that you have
to worry about any of that.

190
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:53,041
New leotard might distract,
you know, the judges and scouts

191
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:56,952
from your lack of talent.
It's a solid strategy.

192
00:15:57,022 --> 00:16:00,924
Gee, Pariah Carey, I wonder
why no one's scouting you.

193
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:05,122
Oh, I forgot, you don't matter.

194
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:11,536
That she can even say
the word "college"

195
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:13,798
is an indictment
against the institution.

196
00:16:13,872 --> 00:16:17,000
Hey, Filibuster, no one cares.

197
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:19,874
Wei Wei. Those moves are
throwing off your routines.

198
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:21,810
Sorry.

199
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,815
Chalk.
Storage closet. Now.

200
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:30,021
Pretty feet, pretty feet.

201
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:33,650
Point them hard
and win the meet.

202
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:34,954
Very good. Yes.

203
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:37,086
Dorrie, did you
see the last one?

204
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:42,657
Wow.

205
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:45,533
Déjà-jealous, Haley?
Bring back memories?

206
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:47,936
We trained together
at Defrank's for how long?

207
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,373
That would be, uh... too long.

208
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:54,503
And he'd give you so much
attention because you sucked.

209
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:56,780
Right.

210
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:59,181
Yeah, I sucked my way to Worlds.

211
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:03,210
Glad to see you haven't lost
your love of accuracy, Joanne.

212
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:07,384
Well, at least I didn't make it
all the way to Worlds and...

213
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:09,950
...um, choke.

214
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,964
Here, let me show you how,

215
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,897
you little...

216
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:17,162
Hey!
Stop right now! Stop it!

217
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:22,003
I said, pointy feet,
not pointy words.

218
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:24,975
Pointy words
are mouth turds. God!

219
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,979
I'm OK. She's crazy.

220
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,413
I'm so jealous of Joanne
that I've actually

221
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:32,916
already memorized
her preschool beam routine.

222
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:35,852
Hey, easy.
I choreographed that routine.

223
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:38,981
Your secret is safe with me.

224
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:46,092
We got some finger-flickin'
good choreography.

225
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:48,565
And the classic butt shelf.

226
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:51,432
Joanne, how embarrassing.

227
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:54,165
Then we have some
useless bits of fluff

228
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:57,208
to get us from
point A to point B.

229
00:17:57,276 --> 00:18:00,837
And induces the urge to vacuum.

230
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:07,512
- Mina, right?
- Yeah, Mina.

231
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,417
Mina, put down the phone.

232
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:12,889
Can you tell Joanne I'm gonna
take over and do a real dismount?

233
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:16,223
Joanne, Haley's on the phone.
She's gonna do a real dismount.

234
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:18,195
I heard her, thank you.

235
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:20,754
How 'bout a double back?

236
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:23,734
You will not throw a double back
without training it first.

237
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:26,202
- Close your eyes.
- Over my dead body.

238
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,933
- Little CPR might do you good.
- Haley!

239
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:37,379
Ahh...

240
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:41,283
Shall we share our philosophy
with Haley, ladies?

241
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:45,153
Speak my mind.
What are we about?

242
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:48,990
Clean, safe routines,
guaranteed to stick.

243
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:54,697
Is he keeping
your brains in jars?

244
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:57,064
Or should I be concerned
about the water?

245
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,969
Shall we show Haley
what discipline is all about?

246
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:01,801
Please join us, Haley.

247
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:06,072
Ehh. No, thanks.
I'm kinda tired.

248
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:10,673
Oh, all right. Fine.
Ladies, outside, now!

249
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:14,412
Point your toes, ladies.

250
00:19:17,122 --> 00:19:20,580
You're gonna keep going
until Haley participates.

251
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:23,492
This is, like, globally unfair.

252
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:27,999
- We're gonna be here all night.
- Lift your knees... Joanne.

253
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:31,297
This is totally
violating the penile code.

254
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:40,604
Hey!

255
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:44,044
Hey! You guys.

256
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:46,482
What, do you want me
to pick the lock, or what?

257
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:48,816
Can you come let me in?

258
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:51,617
Oh, right. Thank you.

259
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,124
Get lost!

260
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:12,410
Haley, let's go for a drive.

261
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:15,846
...deserve to be.
- A what?

262
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:17,939
Thank you, Lorelei,
that was delicious.

263
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:20,644
Actually, you know what?
I'm gonna finish this off...

264
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,277
- No, no.
... if that's OK.

265
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:24,219
- Thank you.
- Are you serious?

266
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:25,984
I heard you were
strict about diet,

267
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,821
but this is just rude.

268
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,487
Hey, you piss where I eat,
you don't eat.

269
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:31,961
Oh, but you do?

270
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,964
Does this mean
you're eating my piss?

271
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:36,023
Well, that's disgusting.

272
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,672
What a charming
young lady you are.

273
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,469
Yeah, that's what they say.

274
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:48,513
Listen, I don't suppose,
uh, college gymnastics

275
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,172
is on your to-do list, right?

276
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:53,377
Correct. College gymnastics
is one big fat to-don't.

277
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:55,420
Great. Then in
addition to sparing

278
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:58,285
innocent collegiate
gymnastics coaches everywhere,

279
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:01,383
you can keep any purse money
that you might win, free and clear.

280
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:04,258
I'm not competing
or training again. Ever.

281
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:08,197
Oh, you're gonna piss off
the judge and kiss 18 goodbye?

282
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,326
I guess.

283
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:15,198
- Hey.
- What the?

284
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,799
The IG Classic is
comin' up in a month.

285
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:19,537
Now, you apply yourself,

286
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,636
you could win
some restitution money.

287
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:23,943
It could get ya outta here.
What do you think?

288
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:26,280
I think if you showed up
at the Classic with me

289
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:28,114
an angry mob would cut your brakes.

290
00:21:28,186 --> 00:21:31,212
- I got insurance.
- Oh, really? Well, no, thank you.

291
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,520
This sport is a total joke.

292
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:35,856
You know this.

293
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:39,260
Sorry to dis your
life's work and all. No offense.

294
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:40,958
Hey, none taken.

295
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:43,763
There's nothin' fair about
a girl landing a double pike

296
00:21:43,835 --> 00:21:46,326
and losing a tenth 'cause
her toes weren't pointed.

297
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:49,306
Nothin' fair about judges
who don't have instant replay,

298
00:21:49,374 --> 00:21:51,205
and they're lookin'
for perfection.

299
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:53,744
Can you imagine football
without instant replay?

300
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:55,746
- What about the rules?
- It'd be mayhem.

301
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,042
The Code of Point? Hey...

302
00:21:57,115 --> 00:21:59,948
Yeah. It makes conventionality
good and innovation bad.

303
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:01,916
What's the point?

304
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:04,217
How 'bout the fact
that you were one

305
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:07,452
of the greatest natural talents
the sport's ever seen? Hmm?

306
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:09,585
C'mon, you coulda been great.

307
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,925
You're not actually pushing

308
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,760
the "you coulda been great" speech.

309
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:16,460
You are a total cliché.
You realize that, right?

310
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:19,504
Oh, OK, come on, uh,
Original Recipe, let's hear it.

311
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:21,095
You give me the speech.

312
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,437
Fine. Uh...

313
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:24,600
Talent out of the ass.

314
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:27,008
Natural ability that
half the world's gymnasts

315
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:29,240
would kill for,
and you're flushing it away.

316
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:30,906
Don't flush your life away, kid.

317
00:22:30,982 --> 00:22:33,382
Step away from the bowl.

318
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:35,386
Whatever.

319
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:41,387
Well, you got
the words right anyway.

320
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:45,726
I wasn't great. I was obedient.

321
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,897
I'm sick and tired of being judged.
I don't need it.

322
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:01,238
- Fascinating.
- What?

323
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:03,144
For someone who
hates being judged,

324
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:05,911
you're one of the most
judgmental people I've ever met.

325
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:07,008
Come on.

326
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:17,822
Well, it's only about
five miles to the gym.

327
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:20,421
Just down here.
Hang a right at the gas station.

328
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:21,727
I know how to get back.

329
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,324
Oh, good. Hey.

330
00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:26,364
Hey, Miss Rebel Without Applause.

331
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:28,736
Tell you what...

332
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:32,106
...you choose to compete in the
IG Classic, you can come back.

333
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:33,906
How's that?

334
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:39,846
Hike'll give you a chance
to think things over.

335
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:42,011
Well, what if I choose
not to come back?

336
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:44,487
Haley...

337
00:23:44,556 --> 00:23:46,524
...tell you the truth...

338
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:49,560
...nobody cares.

339
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:51,619
Nobody cares what ya do.

340
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,461
Wait.

341
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:05,366
I don't...

342
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:10,043
I have nowhere else to go.

343
00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:13,344
Yeah, I know.

344
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:02,997
- Hey.
- Ew.

345
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:04,501
What?

346
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:12,103
Oh, how was
your run last night?

347
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:14,338
- Oh, fantastic, thank you.
- Yeah?

348
00:25:14,412 --> 00:25:16,437
Listen, are you
being serious with me?

349
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:19,313
Because I've had enough
of lunatic adults for a while.

350
00:25:19,384 --> 00:25:21,545
- I'll do what I said I'd do.
- For real.

351
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:24,646
I'll train you for the Classic.
Help you win the purse.

352
00:25:24,723 --> 00:25:26,623
Great. So then here's the deal:

353
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:30,149
Uh, I'm not struggling
in front of those robots.

354
00:25:30,228 --> 00:25:32,492
All right. I'll let you train
at the old gym

355
00:25:32,564 --> 00:25:34,327
till you're ready to face the music.

356
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:35,889
- How's that?
- You'll trust me

357
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:38,197
to be in there alone,
and if anything happens,

358
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:40,295
- I don't wanna hear...
- I got insurance.

359
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:44,068
Come on, get goin'.
You're in training, kid.

360
00:25:44,142 --> 00:25:46,167
- Get goin'!
- What are you talking about?

361
00:25:46,244 --> 00:25:50,112
No, I'm... We just discussed...
I... You suck!

362
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:02,550
<i>Gymnastics
tells you "no" all day long.</i>

363
00:26:02,627 --> 00:26:05,357
<i>It mocks you
over and over again.</i>

364
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:07,193
<i>Telling you, you're an idiot.</i>

365
00:26:07,265 --> 00:26:09,825
<i>That you're crazy.</i>

366
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:13,735
<i>If you like running full speed
towards a stationary object,</i>

367
00:26:13,805 --> 00:26:15,397
<i>vault's for you.</i>

368
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:20,472
<i>If you like peeling pieces of skin</i>

369
00:26:20,545 --> 00:26:23,810
<i>the size of quarters off your hands,
bars is for you.</i>

370
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:27,108
<i>Because the only thing
more fun than rips</i>

371
00:26:27,185 --> 00:26:29,415
<i>is when your rips get rips.</i>

372
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:32,217
<i>It's super sexy.</i>

373
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:34,554
<i>And floor...
Are you serious?</i>

374
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:37,117
<i>I mean, who doesn't wanna
parade around in a leotard</i>

375
00:26:37,195 --> 00:26:39,527
<i>getting wedgies and
doing dorky choreography?</i>

376
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:43,526
<i>It's delicious.</i>

377
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:06,446
<i>If you like falling,</i>

378
00:27:06,524 --> 00:27:09,049
<i>then gymnastics
is the sport for you.</i>

379
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:10,151
Oh!

380
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:12,093
<i>You get to fall on your face,</i>

381
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:16,998
<i>your ass, your back,
your knees and your pride.</i>

382
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:22,562
<i>Good thing
I didn't like falling.</i>

383
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:24,074
<i>I loved it!</i>

384
00:27:33,018 --> 00:27:34,952
Hey.

385
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,113
This mean you can
finally walk again?

386
00:27:37,188 --> 00:27:39,452
Or should we keep the
icemaker on overdrive?

387
00:27:39,524 --> 00:27:43,221
Question, they say
those who can't do, coach.

388
00:27:43,294 --> 00:27:45,558
So I was wondering,
what's your excuse?

389
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:48,565
Ha, ha, ha. No excuse.

390
00:27:48,633 --> 00:27:51,659
Missed a release move on
high bar, fractured my spine.

391
00:27:51,736 --> 00:27:53,727
No biggie.

392
00:27:55,373 --> 00:27:57,841
When I finally got
the OK to train...

393
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:02,272
...got back up
on the tramp and,

394
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:04,338
you know,
things were different.

395
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:09,249
Threw a layout.
Threw a full. And, uh...

396
00:28:13,158 --> 00:28:15,956
You know what?
I'm not tellin' you this story.

397
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:18,154
It's not even a story.
It's a nonevent.

398
00:28:18,229 --> 00:28:20,663
Huh. You were scared.

399
00:28:21,966 --> 00:28:24,230
Ow! Ow.

400
00:28:24,302 --> 00:28:27,999
No. I was done.

401
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:30,166
I know exactly
what that feels like.

402
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:31,731
You chose to be done.

403
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:33,801
I didn't choose it,
my body did.

404
00:28:35,313 --> 00:28:38,009
Well, you know, I think you
should get back on the tramp.

405
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:39,846
To make sure you
still suck, ya know?

406
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:41,078
Yeah. No, thanks.

407
00:28:41,152 --> 00:28:44,053
Get off that thing and start
workin' skills on floor.

408
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:46,454
- You gonna be ready soon?
- Yep.

409
00:28:46,524 --> 00:28:50,858
- Yeah? You gonna hurt yourself?
- Probably.

410
00:28:52,797 --> 00:28:55,891
Just as long as you don't
get blood on the equipment.

411
00:28:55,967 --> 00:28:57,992
Too late.

412
00:29:04,442 --> 00:29:06,410
You tackle the guard,
I'll grab Haley.

413
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:09,140
Why do I have to
tackle the guard? You're bigger.

414
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:12,672
- I'll tackle the warden, you find her.
- Oh, now it's a warden.

415
00:29:21,459 --> 00:29:23,484
- Shh!
- What?

416
00:29:29,567 --> 00:29:31,398
Stairs.

417
00:29:34,205 --> 00:29:35,866
May I help you?

418
00:29:39,177 --> 00:29:42,374
May we?

419
00:29:46,484 --> 00:29:47,542
Haley.

420
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:50,877
Ouch.

421
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:52,889
- Oh.
- These yours?

422
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:55,357
- Holy shit!
- Damn.

423
00:29:55,426 --> 00:29:59,089
- What are you guys doing here?
- What's up? Cracker.

424
00:29:59,164 --> 00:30:02,622
- Juvy, huh? You call this juvy?
- Hmm.

425
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:05,260
OK, trust me, Poot, this is
hard time, OK? He's crazy.

426
00:30:05,336 --> 00:30:07,930
- You've no idea.
- We had maneuvers. Check this out.

427
00:30:08,006 --> 00:30:10,270
OK, boys. Time to go.

428
00:30:10,341 --> 00:30:11,740
- We're cool. Thanks.
- Yeah.

429
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:14,278
Come on, even prisons
have visiting hours.

430
00:30:14,345 --> 00:30:17,781
They're scarin' the minivans
outta the moms next door.

431
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:19,874
Those mommies
were totally hitting on us.

432
00:30:19,951 --> 00:30:21,612
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hitting on us?

433
00:30:21,686 --> 00:30:24,018
Mommies and me, dude.
Mommies and me.

434
00:30:24,088 --> 00:30:27,854
It's the devil's candy, boys.
Trust me. Say goodbye.

435
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:29,223
What've you been doing?

436
00:30:29,294 --> 00:30:32,161
- Probably riding a ton.
- We've got this new location...

437
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:34,460
Out!

438
00:30:34,532 --> 00:30:37,330
- What's up your butt?
- What'd you say about my butt?

439
00:30:38,036 --> 00:30:39,594
I... Um...

440
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,400
Whatever it is, it's sideways.

441
00:30:41,472 --> 00:30:44,202
Come on! Out! Out! Come on!

442
00:30:44,943 --> 00:30:47,002
No, but seriously,
you gotta come with us.

443
00:30:47,078 --> 00:30:49,740
- We found this new, uh...
- I got new...

444
00:30:49,814 --> 00:30:51,543
- Let's go. Come on.
- Whoa, gramps.

445
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:53,675
<i># Every party needs a Poot</i>

446
00:30:53,751 --> 00:30:56,083
<i># That's why we invited you
party pooper #</i>

447
00:31:01,826 --> 00:31:04,260
Let's go.

448
00:31:04,829 --> 00:31:06,660
You suck.

449
00:31:06,731 --> 00:31:10,758
<i>The only reason I'm doing
these tricks is because somebody said,</i>

450
00:31:10,835 --> 00:31:14,794
<i>"I don't care if this is nuts, and I
don't care if it hurts. I'm doing it.</i>

451
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,365
<i>I'm gonna climb this
insanely high mountain.</i>

452
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:22,038
<i>Watch me. " When you're the first to
climb a new mountain in gymnastics,</i>

453
00:31:22,113 --> 00:31:24,877
<i>they name it after you.
A Gienger.</i>

454
00:31:24,949 --> 00:31:27,747
<i>A Rulfova.
A Tchusovitina.</i>

455
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:30,515
<i>A Shaposhnikova.
They all rocked.</i>

456
00:31:30,588 --> 00:31:32,249
<i>And we salute you.</i>

457
00:31:32,323 --> 00:31:35,451
Can you imagine making it
all the way to Worlds and walking out?

458
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:37,357
It's totally insane.

459
00:31:37,428 --> 00:31:40,295
I heard she was tanking her
double pikes in warm-ups.

460
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:42,333
I think she just choked.

461
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,164
I can hear you...
and I'll kill you.

462
00:32:07,825 --> 00:32:10,851
You're poppin' the clutch.
Losin' traction.

463
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,954
I'm not poppin' shit.

464
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:15,158
Oh, really?
You sure?

465
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:17,463
I'm so sure
I'm practically deodorant.

466
00:32:17,535 --> 00:32:20,129
You are such a con artist.

467
00:32:20,204 --> 00:32:21,569
- What?
- Haley...

468
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:24,267
I'm not the one sellin' tickets
to the Olympic podium.

469
00:32:24,342 --> 00:32:26,936
Why not throw something
you can actually land, hm?

470
00:32:27,011 --> 00:32:29,571
Even better, why not live
to tell about it? Come here.

471
00:32:29,647 --> 00:32:31,615
I'm competing this pass
at the Classic.

472
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:33,048
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

473
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:34,641
- No.
- Yes, I am. Know what?

474
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:37,119
If you think I'm getting
on the competition floor

475
00:32:37,188 --> 00:32:40,055
with some stupid, watered-down,
cookie-cutter routine,

476
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:41,421
you are seriously senile.

477
00:32:41,492 --> 00:32:43,483
Have you ever seen
anyone blow a knee?

478
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:45,495
- No.
- Do you wanna keep it that way,

479
00:32:45,563 --> 00:32:47,827
or should we have an
ambulance on call for ya?

480
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:49,594
Call 'em up.

481
00:32:50,401 --> 00:32:52,995
Do a handstand. Now.

482
00:32:56,874 --> 00:32:59,809
You're pushin' it.

483
00:32:59,877 --> 00:33:02,641
Let your clutch out slower.
Get some traction.

484
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:05,478
That way you won't be
fishtailing all over the place.

485
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,211
You won't crash.

486
00:33:07,285 --> 00:33:10,812
- Stop flooring it.
- Way to build trust.

487
00:33:10,888 --> 00:33:12,879
Couldn't resist.

488
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:18,321
You're poppin' your clutch.

489
00:33:19,197 --> 00:33:21,995
Haley, I'm not gonna tell ya
to play it safe,

490
00:33:22,066 --> 00:33:23,590
'cause I'd be wasting my time.

491
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:26,000
You wanna throw hard tricks,
throw hard tricks.

492
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:28,698
When you wanna control them,
see me. Hmm?

493
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:33,374
Mat burn.

494
00:33:33,444 --> 00:33:36,106
<i>...World Championships
two years ago.</i>

495
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,114
<i>Team USA was just
one rotation away</i>

496
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:39,945
<i>from winning the gold medal.</i>

497
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:43,818
<i>Haley Graham was set to go for
the Americans, last up on the floor.</i>

498
00:33:43,888 --> 00:33:47,346
<i>Instead, she stunned
her teammates, spectators</i>

499
00:33:47,425 --> 00:33:50,917
<i>and coaches alike by
walking out of the arena</i>

500
00:33:50,995 --> 00:33:53,657
<i>and into an automatic
disqualification.</i>

501
00:33:53,731 --> 00:33:55,358
Why'd she walk out?

502
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:58,231
<i>Few can forget the image
of teammate Tricia Skilken</i>

503
00:33:58,302 --> 00:34:00,964
<i>crying as her dreams
of gold melted away.</i>

504
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,234
<i>Later this year, at 23, Tricia will try</i>

505
00:34:03,307 --> 00:34:05,798
<i>to make that World Championship
team one more time,</i>

506
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:09,643
<i>and win that elusive World
Championship hardware.</i>

507
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:40,299
How much are these?

508
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:58,522
Tumble track, ladies.
Come on, warm up.

509
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:02,191
Ahh. And to what
do we owe this pleasure?

510
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:05,358
Don't make me say it.

511
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:06,960
Say what?

512
00:35:12,076 --> 00:35:16,308
- I wanna control my tricks.
- What was that? Did you say something?

513
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:22,108
I want
to control my tricks.

514
00:35:22,186 --> 00:35:24,780
Sorry, I'm having a very
difficult time hearing you.

515
00:35:24,856 --> 00:35:27,791
Right. I'm not... I know you
can hear me. You can hear me.

516
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:29,121
- Speak up.
- OK, great.

517
00:35:29,193 --> 00:35:31,661
I want to control my tricks. OK?

518
00:35:31,729 --> 00:35:34,596
Oh, you wanna learn control.

519
00:35:34,665 --> 00:35:37,293
You know everything.
What could I possibly show you?

520
00:35:37,368 --> 00:35:41,498
Vick? Can we retire the old
long sleeve competition leos?

521
00:35:41,572 --> 00:35:43,836
I have a constitutional right
to bear arms.

522
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:49,241
Woo-hoo. Bailey's back.

523
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:52,373
Joanne, go do
your independent study.

524
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:58,281
Well, doesn't she
have to homeschool?

525
00:35:58,356 --> 00:35:59,482
Mina?

526
00:36:01,225 --> 00:36:03,716
Tell the foxy moron
I got my GED when I was 15.

527
00:36:03,794 --> 00:36:06,991
Joanne, Haley got her
GED when she was 15.

528
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:09,191
What's with all
the closed captioning?

529
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:12,668
OK? I'm not mute.

530
00:36:12,737 --> 00:36:18,107
And GED? What does drunk driving
have to do with school?

531
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:24,606
I know it's tough.
Chest up if you can manage it.

532
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:26,047
Tight knees.

533
00:36:26,117 --> 00:36:29,678
Feet above the beam.
Tight. Tight.

534
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:33,053
Tight knees. Tight.
That's seven.

535
00:36:33,124 --> 00:36:35,752
Come on, just three more
skin the cats, ladies.

536
00:36:36,794 --> 00:36:39,262
Flat hips on those levers.

537
00:36:41,966 --> 00:36:43,695
Aw, come on,
those skin the cats

538
00:36:43,768 --> 00:36:47,499
belong in the litter box, ladies.
Come on. Concentrate.

539
00:36:47,572 --> 00:36:49,164
Get used to this kinda pain.

540
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,140
You know you've
got to endure this.

541
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:54,508
<i>Elite gymnastics is
like the Navy SEALs, only harder.</i>

542
00:36:54,579 --> 00:36:56,137
We're only a half hour in.

543
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:58,239
<i>And there are
like 2,000 Navy SEALs,</i>

544
00:36:58,316 --> 00:37:01,479
<i>but there are
only like 200 elite gymnasts.</i>

545
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:05,181
<i>I guess because most kids'd rather
have a life than spend six hours a day</i>

546
00:37:05,256 --> 00:37:09,750
<i>training tricks that could kill you.
Don't be fooled by the leotards, people.</i>

547
00:37:09,827 --> 00:37:12,660
<i>The things gymnasts do make
Navy SEALs look like wusses.</i>

548
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,891
<i>And we do them without a gun.</i>

549
00:37:14,966 --> 00:37:18,094
Relax your face.
Relax your face.

550
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:20,865
Relax your face.
Here, here, here.

551
00:37:20,938 --> 00:37:22,303
Relax that.

552
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:23,533
Your muscles.

553
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:45,452
Based on progress and
consistency in workouts,

554
00:37:45,529 --> 00:37:47,258
I've selected
the four athletes

555
00:37:47,331 --> 00:37:49,595
who will compete
in the IG Classic.

556
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:52,431
They are... Lacey...

557
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,705
...Devon...

558
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:58,571
...Brooke...

559
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:01,641
...and Joanne.

560
00:38:04,649 --> 00:38:07,914
What? What about me?

561
00:38:07,985 --> 00:38:09,885
- What about you?
- Our deal?

562
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:13,390
The selection's based on who's ready.
If you were, you'd be on the list.

563
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:15,891
- You just get to decide?
- Yes.

564
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,622
They get spots handed to them?
What about us?

565
00:38:18,696 --> 00:38:20,721
I don't like what
you're instimulating.

566
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:23,062
- "Instimulating"?
- I totally earned my spot.

567
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:25,102
- Girls.
- I'm practically a Dalmatian.

568
00:38:25,169 --> 00:38:27,069
Dalmatians are born with spots.

569
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:29,470
They don't earn them,
which is exactly my point.

570
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:32,031
Dogs are people too, Haley.

571
00:38:32,743 --> 00:38:35,234
Very nice, Joanne. Touché.

572
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:36,871
Thank you.

573
00:38:36,947 --> 00:38:39,415
All right. You know what?

574
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:40,973
Take whoever, Vick.

575
00:38:41,052 --> 00:38:45,318
Nobody cares.
Nobody cares what ya do, Vick.

576
00:38:45,389 --> 00:38:47,721
Nobody cares what you do.

577
00:38:49,527 --> 00:38:51,051
They're all lazy.

578
00:38:51,128 --> 00:38:54,723
Put some fire under their
gluteus and make competition.

579
00:38:54,799 --> 00:38:56,926
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

580
00:38:57,001 --> 00:39:00,334
You know, Haley
makes a good point.

581
00:39:00,404 --> 00:39:02,395
Why not an in-house competition?

582
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:06,006
Because we no lo need-o.

583
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:08,136
Let's get back to work, ladies.

584
00:39:08,212 --> 00:39:10,305
No killing Haley in her sleep.

585
00:39:54,191 --> 00:39:58,525
You know, I would be nervous
if I were you too.

586
00:39:58,596 --> 00:40:01,429
The judge on the end
is a tumbling tyrant.

587
00:40:01,499 --> 00:40:04,491
If you even think about
under-rotating, she'll deduct.

588
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:05,626
Yeah, I know.

589
00:40:05,703 --> 00:40:06,863
The one next to her,

590
00:40:06,937 --> 00:40:09,405
obsessive-compulsive
about handstands.

591
00:40:09,473 --> 00:40:12,931
I'm talking, hit your vertical
or die, ladies.

592
00:40:14,311 --> 00:40:15,710
And please,
please, for me,

593
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,271
watch out for the
vault dick on the end.

594
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:20,442
If you don't stick it, you don't exist.

595
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:23,248
- Am I right, Haley?
- Are you still pimping that speech?

596
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,379
I don't know what
you're talking about.

597
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:30,321
She's psychin' you out.
Look, ignore her.

598
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:33,889
When I get nervous,
I have this ritual. OK?

599
00:40:33,964 --> 00:40:35,591
I just look at the judges,

600
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:37,463
and I picture them in their ugly

601
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:39,594
blue blazers,
trying to do what I can do.

602
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:18,097
Whatever ya do...
don't picture them naked.

603
00:41:18,175 --> 00:41:21,008
- It's really gross.
- Too late.

604
00:42:47,831 --> 00:42:51,267
So the winner today is...

605
00:42:51,335 --> 00:42:53,269
...Wei Wei.

606
00:42:53,337 --> 00:42:57,569
Mina was second,
followed by Haley.

607
00:42:57,641 --> 00:42:59,575
- And then...
- Mm? Huh?

608
00:42:59,643 --> 00:43:02,771
...Lacey.
Joanne will be an alternate.

609
00:43:02,846 --> 00:43:04,404
What?!

610
00:43:04,481 --> 00:43:08,941
I am nationally ranked.
I am not an alternate.

611
00:43:09,019 --> 00:43:11,579
Joanne, you already
qualified for Championships.

612
00:43:11,655 --> 00:43:13,646
- Mom.
- The Classic could be a qualifier

613
00:43:13,724 --> 00:43:16,522
for those who aren't currently ranked.
Fair is fair.

614
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:19,085
This meet was a joke.

615
00:43:19,163 --> 00:43:21,631
Come on.

616
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:24,964
Déjà-jealous, Joanne?

617
00:43:28,906 --> 00:43:30,533
Do you have anything
to say to me?

618
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:33,771
Yeah. Who taught you
to control your landing? Hm?

619
00:43:33,844 --> 00:43:35,675
Some guy.

620
00:43:41,218 --> 00:43:44,244
- Watch your rotation.
- Morning, ladies.

621
00:43:45,089 --> 00:43:47,649
- Whoa.
- Don't force it, Lacey. Easy.

622
00:43:47,725 --> 00:43:50,626
- Joanne.
- Hmm?

623
00:43:50,694 --> 00:43:53,390
I need you to lend Haley
your team leo for the Classic.

624
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:56,661
- Ew!
- Ew! Unsanitary.

625
00:43:56,734 --> 00:43:58,964
- Yeah.
- Ow!

626
00:43:59,036 --> 00:44:00,833
Ohh!

627
00:44:04,108 --> 00:44:07,669
Joanne, pack your bags.

628
00:44:07,745 --> 00:44:12,079
Lacey, I need you to lend
Haley your leo for the Classic.

629
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:15,785
Yes!

630
00:44:24,194 --> 00:44:27,129
- Good luck, girls.
- Later.

631
00:44:27,197 --> 00:44:29,961
Wait. Do you have a license
to practice gymnastics?

632
00:44:30,034 --> 00:44:31,899
It was revoked. Get in.

633
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:35,104
I'll see ya in there.

634
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:48,113
- Hey.
- Hi.

635
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:49,982
What do they have
that we don't have?

636
00:44:50,054 --> 00:44:52,147
- Yeah.
- Uh, lives.

637
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:54,655
Time.

638
00:44:55,492 --> 00:44:57,323
Boobs.

639
00:45:08,238 --> 00:45:10,570
Just ignore 'em.

640
00:45:10,641 --> 00:45:12,734
You're gonna
shut up and drive.

641
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:33,291
Well, at least
no one here hates you.

642
00:45:33,363 --> 00:45:36,958
Yet. I mean, you're new.

643
00:45:37,034 --> 00:45:39,559
You can make a splash.
Let it rip.

644
00:45:39,636 --> 00:45:40,694
Let what rip?

645
00:45:40,771 --> 00:45:44,537
Make the judges look. But I'm not
talking about putting a cute smile

646
00:45:44,608 --> 00:45:46,735
on your face as if
they're doing you a favor.

647
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:50,405
Make them look. If you're
gonna eat mat, ya eat mat hard.

648
00:45:50,481 --> 00:45:52,540
Don't play it safe.

649
00:45:52,616 --> 00:45:56,245
Ya gotta throw your best tricks
as hard as you can.

650
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,754
- Haley!
- Hey, Haley! What's up?

651
00:46:00,324 --> 00:46:01,951
- Woo!
- Hey, man.

652
00:46:02,025 --> 00:46:03,617
Hey.

653
00:46:05,829 --> 00:46:07,387
That was for Worlds.

654
00:46:07,464 --> 00:46:09,864
What?!
Are you kidding me?!

655
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:11,025
- You see that?
- What?

656
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:13,069
You OK?

657
00:46:15,172 --> 00:46:17,140
Take a minute. Go clean up.

658
00:46:17,207 --> 00:46:19,732
Buy yourself a new leo
at the concession stand.

659
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:22,142
- Here. You OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

660
00:46:22,212 --> 00:46:24,772
- Hmm?
- Yeah, I can handle it.

661
00:46:28,652 --> 00:46:30,313
Ugly...

662
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:32,349
Hey.

663
00:46:32,422 --> 00:46:35,152
Can you believe this?

664
00:46:35,225 --> 00:46:36,886
- Did you see it?
- Yeah, I saw it.

665
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,258
Are you... totally covered
in soda or what?

666
00:46:39,329 --> 00:46:41,297
- Thank you.
- I'm so pissed at that kid.

667
00:46:41,365 --> 00:46:44,425
We were totally gonna throw drinks
on you. I feel so upstaged.

668
00:46:44,501 --> 00:46:46,560
They think they can just hate on you?

669
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:48,264
I know. Who do
they think they are?

670
00:46:48,338 --> 00:46:50,772
They're fakers.
Can't stand fake Haley-haters.

671
00:46:50,841 --> 00:46:52,103
It's a bloody outrage.

672
00:46:52,176 --> 00:46:54,235
We hate Haley more, people,
so get in line!

673
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:55,642
Would you shut up?

674
00:46:55,712 --> 00:46:58,476
- Can't I be upset?
- Can I go compete now?

675
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:03,551
Can I eat?

676
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:06,020
- I'm so hungry.
- Let's get some nachos.

677
00:47:07,791 --> 00:47:09,554
You know boys?

678
00:47:09,626 --> 00:47:13,585
Yes. They're called friends.
You should try it sometime.

679
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:26,768
OK, Wei Wei,
control it now.

680
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:28,505
Let's focus.

681
00:47:28,579 --> 00:47:31,446
- Come on, Wei Wei, let's go!
- You got it. Come on, let it rip.

682
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:33,506
Tighten up. Push up.

683
00:47:33,584 --> 00:47:36,018
Let it rip.

684
00:47:36,086 --> 00:47:37,678
You know what you're doing.

685
00:47:37,754 --> 00:47:39,085
Let's go. Come on!

686
00:47:47,965 --> 00:47:50,331
Dude.

687
00:47:52,269 --> 00:47:54,601
- All right, Wei Wei.
- Way to go!

688
00:47:54,671 --> 00:47:57,037
Good job, Wei Wei.

689
00:47:57,107 --> 00:47:59,837
Hm? What happened?

690
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:02,140
Looked like you were
goin' for a one and a half?

691
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:04,510
- What happened?
- Uh... I don't know.

692
00:48:04,581 --> 00:48:07,106
It's OK now.
Shake it off.

693
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:12,050
Get in on the board now.

694
00:48:18,262 --> 00:48:20,992
Oh!

695
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:23,089
How did we not know
about this sport?

696
00:48:24,368 --> 00:48:26,393
What the hell was that?!

697
00:48:32,976 --> 00:48:35,672
Since when are you
throwin' double fronts?

698
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:37,043
Hmm?

699
00:48:37,114 --> 00:48:40,413
- What was that?
- Nothing.

700
00:48:43,987 --> 00:48:45,477
Nice double front.

701
00:48:45,555 --> 00:48:48,615
That was amazing.
Who cares if you took a few steps?

702
00:48:48,692 --> 00:48:52,287
- The judges.
- Whatever. You rock.

703
00:48:55,499 --> 00:48:57,524
What're you doing? Hmm?

704
00:48:58,568 --> 00:49:01,196
I'm doing what I practiced.
I won't make you look bad.

705
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:04,138
This isn't about that.
You're not here to coach the girls.

706
00:49:04,207 --> 00:49:06,801
You're here to place top three,
win money and get out.

707
00:49:06,877 --> 00:49:08,401
You do your job,
let me do mine.

708
00:49:08,478 --> 00:49:10,469
Fine, then I'm flooring it.

709
00:49:10,547 --> 00:49:12,742
You should really
try it some time.

710
00:49:12,816 --> 00:49:14,681
Don't do it.

711
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:17,811
- Come on, Haley, let it rip.
- Woo! Let's go, Haley!

712
00:49:17,888 --> 00:49:18,877
Come on, you got it.

713
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:46,472
- All right, Haley!
- Woo! Yeah...

714
00:49:52,189 --> 00:49:54,987
Too much rock
for one hand, baby!

715
00:50:32,963 --> 00:50:34,396
Yeah!

716
00:50:40,137 --> 00:50:42,401
- It's all right.
- Nice stick, Wei Wei.

717
00:50:42,472 --> 00:50:44,269
Stop being so nasty, Joanne.

718
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,673
It's not called "gym-nice-tics. "

719
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:57,349
Don't you see?
She wants you to do

720
00:50:57,421 --> 00:51:00,219
your hardest tricks because
she knows you'll mess up.

721
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:03,851
She's been practicing that stuff
in the old gym for weeks now.

722
00:51:03,927 --> 00:51:05,895
She's trying to
get you guys to mess up

723
00:51:05,962 --> 00:51:09,898
so she can win
the prize money. Duh.

724
00:51:36,626 --> 00:51:41,063
Can you believe Chris Defrank
is here with Gloria? Pipsqueak.

725
00:51:41,131 --> 00:51:45,033
We trained together at
Defrank's for what, five years?

726
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:47,730
Ugh, I can't stand him.

727
00:51:47,804 --> 00:51:50,773
She should get at least two-tenths
deducted for that hair.

728
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:54,433
Or not.

729
00:51:57,481 --> 00:52:00,848
Haley! Haley!
Over here.

730
00:52:00,917 --> 00:52:02,976
Hi, honey.
I miss you, sweetheart.

731
00:52:03,053 --> 00:52:06,648
I missed you so much.
Hey, you're doin' a great job.

732
00:52:06,723 --> 00:52:09,089
I need to talk about
comin' back with Chris.

733
00:52:09,159 --> 00:52:12,094
Doesn't look good, having you
trainin' with somebody else.

734
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:14,963
- No.
- Hey, hey, hey.

735
00:52:15,031 --> 00:52:16,692
You owe Chris some respect.

736
00:52:16,766 --> 00:52:19,166
I don't respect people
who don't respect me.

737
00:52:19,236 --> 00:52:21,568
And you think
Burt Vickerman respects you.

738
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:23,663
Yeah. Actually, I do.

739
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:26,607
The only thing Burt Vickerman
respects is money.

740
00:52:26,676 --> 00:52:28,610
He cares about
cash and cashing in.

741
00:52:28,678 --> 00:52:30,578
And if your daddy
hadn't paid him off,

742
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:33,115
you'd be sittin' at Texas
Military Academy now.

743
00:52:33,183 --> 00:52:35,913
What do you mean, "paid him off"?
Everybody there pays.

744
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:38,819
Your daddy called
every elite gym in the country.

745
00:52:38,889 --> 00:52:41,221
Nobody wanted you.

746
00:52:41,291 --> 00:52:44,192
Honey, your dad's
payin' four times

747
00:52:44,261 --> 00:52:46,456
what every other
girl there is payin'.

748
00:52:51,201 --> 00:52:53,692
You thought
he was on your side?

749
00:52:54,538 --> 00:52:56,836
Haley.

750
00:52:56,907 --> 00:53:00,775
He only has one side. His.

751
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:03,608
- I gotta go warm up beam.
- Haley.

752
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:06,713
- You need some lipstick.
- No. Mom.

753
00:53:06,783 --> 00:53:08,944
- Let me, let me, let me...
- Don't!

754
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:13,580
Keep it up, hon.
You're doin' great.

755
00:53:13,657 --> 00:53:16,524
Stand up straight.
Eyes and teeth, sugar.

756
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:21,892
Arms. Arms. Spot.
That's it.

757
00:53:21,965 --> 00:53:24,763
- Nice.
- What?

758
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:28,570
You wanna win the purse,
we get it.

759
00:53:28,638 --> 00:53:32,404
Yeah. I hope we ate mat
hard enough for you.

760
00:53:38,114 --> 00:53:40,048
Flat hips.

761
00:53:40,116 --> 00:53:42,311
Today's not just
about you, ya know.

762
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:46,451
Expected more out of you.

763
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:51,758
OK, tight knees now.

764
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:07,467
Whoo!

765
00:54:09,813 --> 00:54:12,714
Oww!

766
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:22,080
Oh!

767
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:42,911
- It's all right. Let's go!
- Come on, Haley!

768
00:55:48,078 --> 00:55:50,171
Shake it off, Haley.
Come on.

769
00:55:51,715 --> 00:55:54,445
You got another event.
Let's finish big.

770
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:56,883
Warm up, Mina.

771
00:55:56,953 --> 00:55:58,887
Let's go. 'Scuse me.

772
00:56:01,558 --> 00:56:02,889
Haley.

773
00:56:02,959 --> 00:56:04,722
Don't do this again.

774
00:56:04,794 --> 00:56:07,854
Let's go back in there
and finish this meet. Come on.

775
00:56:07,931 --> 00:56:11,492
Don't bail again. Finish the meet.
Finish it for yourself!

776
00:56:11,568 --> 00:56:14,935
Me? Yeah, you said something
about the fact that this was about me.

777
00:56:15,004 --> 00:56:17,666
You know, helping me.
My freedom.

778
00:56:17,741 --> 00:56:20,869
You forgot to tell me about the
part you were cashing in on it.

779
00:56:22,278 --> 00:56:24,473
Haley. I meant everything I said.

780
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:25,741
I never lied to you.

781
00:56:25,815 --> 00:56:29,581
Everything you said was insurance
to get those fat checks from my father.

782
00:56:29,652 --> 00:56:32,018
Haley, you're not leaving like this.

783
00:56:32,088 --> 00:56:35,319
You're gonna go back in there.
Finish this meet.

784
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:37,724
Don't make this another Worlds.

785
00:56:37,794 --> 00:56:39,125
- No.
- Don't bail.

786
00:56:39,195 --> 00:56:41,459
You don't know
the first thing about Worlds.

787
00:56:41,531 --> 00:56:43,829
Fine, I give up.
You know, we gave it a shot.

788
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:47,063
I'll talk to your father.
Maybe you should go back to Defrank's.

789
00:56:47,137 --> 00:56:49,401
- Chris Defrank's?
- Hey...

790
00:56:49,472 --> 00:56:54,000
- You want me to go back to Defrank's?
- Well, you don't listen to me.

791
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:56,568
Clearly you listened
to him long enough to...

792
00:56:56,646 --> 00:56:59,638
Yeah, long enough to
hook up with my mom.

793
00:57:04,187 --> 00:57:06,348
Hmm?

794
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,094
Long enough for him to...

795
00:57:12,162 --> 00:57:15,393
...rip my family apart.

796
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:20,865
Oh, hey. When d?

797
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:23,735
When did ya find this out?

798
00:57:26,209 --> 00:57:28,177
Before floor...

799
00:57:28,244 --> 00:57:30,235
...at Worlds.

800
00:57:33,483 --> 00:57:35,610
Aw, Haley, I...

801
00:57:35,685 --> 00:57:38,210
I had no idea.

802
00:57:39,823 --> 00:57:41,950
- I'm sorry.
- You know what?

803
00:57:44,527 --> 00:57:47,496
You didn't owe it to me
to be a decent coach.

804
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:52,693
You owed it to me to be
a decent human being.

805
00:58:26,202 --> 00:58:29,194
You tanked like a rock star.
That was insane.

806
00:58:29,272 --> 00:58:31,263
Yeah, right.

807
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:35,444
Hey, Haley, can I
ask you something?

808
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:38,777
And I'm being
completely serious.

809
00:58:38,848 --> 00:58:41,783
Why do girls wear so much
glitter and clippage in their hair?

810
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:44,376
I mean, that is some
uptight friggin' hair. Right?

811
00:58:44,454 --> 00:58:46,422
How do leotards not
ride up their butts?

812
00:58:46,489 --> 00:58:48,218
- Yeah, good one.
- Tuf-Skin.

813
00:58:48,291 --> 00:58:50,452
Aww.
They have ass calluses?

814
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:52,461
No. Uh...

815
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:54,963
It's just this sticky stuff
you spray on your butt

816
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:56,555
so the leotard doesn't ride up.

817
00:58:56,633 --> 00:58:59,431
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Can I get that job? I wanna be Tuf-Skin.

818
00:58:59,502 --> 00:59:00,833
- Shut up.
- Hey.

819
00:59:00,904 --> 00:59:02,269
What would happen if you put

820
00:59:02,338 --> 00:59:04,670
some of that Tuf-Skin
stuff on tough skin?

821
00:59:04,741 --> 00:59:06,641
Your head would stick to your butt.

822
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:08,643
Why would my head stick to my butt?

823
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:11,646
'Cause your head's
already up there! Ah!

824
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:14,615
Don't worry, Frank...

825
00:59:14,684 --> 00:59:16,982
...my head's up my butt too.

826
00:59:17,053 --> 00:59:19,214
Far.

827
00:59:28,031 --> 00:59:30,295
Oh. Have a seat, Haley.

828
00:59:32,268 --> 00:59:34,998
I'd like you to read something
for me, please, out loud.

829
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:36,834
Second paragraph.

830
00:59:38,875 --> 00:59:41,639
Uh... "The gymnastics world,
like the real world,

831
00:59:41,711 --> 00:59:43,736
can be a very unforgiving place.

832
00:59:43,813 --> 00:59:47,476
As I know all too well, there might be
too much chalk on the blackboard

833
00:59:47,550 --> 00:59:50,986
for her to get a clean slate,
competing with me or anyone else.

834
00:59:51,054 --> 00:59:54,717
And Haley has earned
the right to a clean slate.

835
00:59:54,791 --> 00:59:57,453
She's quite capable of
deciding what's best for her.

836
00:59:57,527 --> 01:00:00,087
And I encourage the court
to include her perspective

837
01:00:00,163 --> 01:00:03,257
in its decision.
Sincerely, Burt Vickerman. "

838
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:10,573
That's all, Haley.
You're free to go.

839
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:12,870
What about the restitution?

840
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:15,240
Oh, that's been taken care of.

841
01:00:15,311 --> 01:00:17,302
Be good.

842
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:19,177
Sounds like you're built for it.

843
01:00:21,517 --> 01:00:22,882
Thank you.

844
01:00:27,857 --> 01:00:29,154
You know, Haley,

845
01:00:29,225 --> 01:00:32,353
there are a lot
of great people

846
01:00:32,428 --> 01:00:35,420
who had jerks for parents.

847
01:00:36,566 --> 01:00:39,501
We gotta stick together.

848
01:00:44,507 --> 01:00:47,999
- The tights?
- What are they? In Special Ed?

849
01:00:48,077 --> 01:00:49,305
- You'd know, huh?
- Nice.

850
01:00:49,379 --> 01:00:50,903
Whatever.

851
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:54,177
Hey, guys, I have a gut feelin'
somethin' bad's gonna happen.

852
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:56,184
- What?
- What do you mean, dude?

853
01:00:57,820 --> 01:01:02,189
Oh! Dude, keep it over there!

854
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:04,849
Whoo!

855
01:01:04,927 --> 01:01:07,862
- Oh!
- What? I can't hold it.

856
01:01:08,798 --> 01:01:10,959
Stay tight in the air.

857
01:01:11,034 --> 01:01:14,060
Oh, nice! Nice. Nice.

858
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:23,506
You got through an entire letter
without using the word "gold. "

859
01:01:23,579 --> 01:01:25,513
It was tough.

860
01:01:25,581 --> 01:01:27,674
And the restitution.
I mean, was that?

861
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:30,947
Dev?
Give us a sec, would ya?

862
01:01:34,624 --> 01:01:37,388
Look, don't... uh,
don't read anything into it.

863
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:39,121
- You didn't have to do that.
- I...

864
01:01:39,195 --> 01:01:41,925
I paid with your father's money.

865
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:47,165
You know what? I, uh...

866
01:01:47,236 --> 01:01:51,229
I completely misjudged you.

867
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:55,439
Hmm.

868
01:02:00,817 --> 01:02:03,809
I've decided I'm gonna
take you to Championships.

869
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:05,877
You know, show you
how to really do it.

870
01:02:05,955 --> 01:02:07,923
Come on,
you're high on chalk.

871
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:12,259
Who even said you could stay?
I didn't say you could stay.

872
01:02:12,328 --> 01:02:13,386
- Haley!
- Hey, Mina.

873
01:02:13,463 --> 01:02:15,021
- Hey.
- Hey, Wei Wei.

874
01:02:15,098 --> 01:02:16,258
- We're so sorry.
- Yeah.

875
01:02:16,332 --> 01:02:18,027
Joanne kind of misrepresented...

876
01:02:18,101 --> 01:02:20,569
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Don't worry, I understand.

877
01:02:20,636 --> 01:02:22,604
Listen, I'll stay
on one condition.

878
01:02:22,672 --> 01:02:23,969
Oh, this I gotta hear.

879
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:26,702
Does it involve you
and self-imposed silence?

880
01:02:26,776 --> 01:02:28,004
Get back on the tramp.

881
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:30,602
You girls
wanna see Vick do a layout?

882
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:32,875
He's so, like, old, though.

883
01:02:32,949 --> 01:02:34,917
- Hey.
- Uh, he might break a hip.

884
01:02:34,984 --> 01:02:38,920
No. He'll be fine.
Come on.

885
01:02:38,988 --> 01:02:42,185
I'll go to Championships if
you get on the tramp right now,

886
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:43,748
and you do a layout.

887
01:02:43,826 --> 01:02:46,090
- It's your call.
- Don't do it, Vick.

888
01:02:46,162 --> 01:02:49,757
- This is a really bad idea.
- Come on, Vick.

889
01:02:49,832 --> 01:02:52,801
Vick!
Vick! Vick! Vick!

890
01:02:52,869 --> 01:02:56,305
If you get on this tramp,
you will have a cardiovasectomy.

891
01:02:56,372 --> 01:02:58,465
I will have
a cardiovasectomy.

892
01:02:58,541 --> 01:03:00,566
Come on, Vick!
Come on! Come on, Vick!

893
01:03:00,643 --> 01:03:03,305
- You can do it!
- Peer pressure.

894
01:03:03,379 --> 01:03:05,847
- Ah!
- Think about your weenus.

895
01:03:08,885 --> 01:03:11,285
- Come on, Vick!
- Go, Vick!

896
01:03:11,354 --> 01:03:13,549
Vick! Vick!
Vick! Vick!

897
01:03:19,061 --> 01:03:22,588
- Layout!
- Layout! Layout!

898
01:03:22,665 --> 01:03:25,657
Layout! Layout! Layout!

899
01:03:25,735 --> 01:03:30,331
OK, you can come down now.

900
01:03:31,541 --> 01:03:33,975
How 'bout a full?

901
01:03:34,043 --> 01:03:35,806
- What?
- Yeah, boy!

902
01:03:35,878 --> 01:03:38,642
Yeah!

903
01:03:38,714 --> 01:03:41,410
- Oh, no!
- Oh, my God.

904
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:42,576
I told you so.

905
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:48,147
Call 911. Ohh!

906
01:03:52,929 --> 01:03:54,863
- Bye, Vick.
- He can't hear you.

907
01:03:58,935 --> 01:04:01,529
- What's up?
- Hiya.

908
01:04:01,604 --> 01:04:03,697
Hey, ladies!
How ya doin'?

909
01:04:03,773 --> 01:04:04,831
Hi.

910
01:04:04,907 --> 01:04:07,307
I'm Poot, and this is
my hetero life-mate, Frank.

911
01:04:07,376 --> 01:04:09,469
We're here to be
your hosts for this evening

912
01:04:09,545 --> 01:04:11,843
'cause we're goin' out! Ow!

913
01:04:11,914 --> 01:04:13,541
No, we aren't.

914
01:04:13,616 --> 01:04:15,447
We have workouts to finish.

915
01:04:15,518 --> 01:04:17,679
Who died and made you Nadia?

916
01:04:17,753 --> 01:04:19,311
You know you wanna go.

917
01:04:19,388 --> 01:04:22,585
We can't just leave.
Championships are three weeks away.

918
01:04:22,658 --> 01:04:24,353
Our routines need to be perfect.

919
01:04:24,427 --> 01:04:27,624
Put some clothes on and get
in the truck. We're goin' out.

920
01:04:28,764 --> 01:04:30,493
- Come on!
- Yeah!

921
01:04:30,566 --> 01:04:32,966
Come on.

922
01:04:34,403 --> 01:04:35,768
Can you speak?

923
01:04:36,405 --> 01:04:39,169
Can you do anything
besides gymnastics?

924
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:45,639
OK. Anything to
get out of this 'tard.

925
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:48,343
That's "leotard"
without the "leo. "

926
01:04:48,417 --> 01:04:50,009
In case
you were wondering.

927
01:04:53,489 --> 01:04:55,252
Dude, she's hot.

928
01:04:55,324 --> 01:04:57,792
What? You don't think
she's hot? I think she's hot.

929
01:04:57,860 --> 01:04:59,384
Dude, she has an apple butt.

930
01:04:59,462 --> 01:05:01,692
- A what?
- An apple butt.

931
01:05:01,764 --> 01:05:04,232
<i>[# Fannypack: Nu Nu</i>

932
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:06,632
Whoops.

933
01:05:06,702 --> 01:05:08,397
OK, now my turn.

934
01:05:08,471 --> 01:05:11,463
So is Frank your, like,
boyfriend or something?

935
01:05:11,540 --> 01:05:13,565
Like, no.

936
01:05:13,643 --> 01:05:15,975
- Is Poot?
- No.

937
01:05:16,045 --> 01:05:18,377
- Why not?
- Ew!

938
01:05:18,447 --> 01:05:20,210
So they're, like, fair game?

939
01:05:20,283 --> 01:05:22,148
- Ye...
- Hey, stupid.

940
01:05:22,218 --> 01:05:24,311
I prefer the term
"meat," please.

941
01:05:24,387 --> 01:05:26,150
That was spastic.

942
01:05:26,222 --> 01:05:27,712
Thank you.

943
01:05:27,790 --> 01:05:30,088
May I accompany you
to the jellybeans?

944
01:05:30,593 --> 01:05:32,026
You may.

945
01:05:32,094 --> 01:05:33,721
After you, milady.

946
01:05:33,796 --> 01:05:35,491
Yes!

947
01:06:12,802 --> 01:06:15,896
We're out of the starlet blue.
We're out, we're out, we're out.

948
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:18,668
- Excuse me. I'll take this one.
- OK.

949
01:06:18,741 --> 01:06:22,507
- And I'm so sorry about them.
- Why? It's hilarious.

950
01:06:23,412 --> 01:06:24,504
- Hey.
- Hey.

951
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:26,912
We also have that style
with spaghetti straps.

952
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:30,248
Huh. So, uh, why
are you buying a dress?

953
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:32,344
Because you're
taking me to your prom.

954
01:06:32,421 --> 01:06:35,185
Well, shouldn't you
be buying a tux? Just kidding.

955
01:06:35,257 --> 01:06:36,724
We can both wear dresses.

956
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:42,153
- Don't worry. I'll totally shave.
- OK.

957
01:06:43,566 --> 01:06:46,262
I have a feelin'
somethin' bad's gonna happen.

958
01:06:46,335 --> 01:06:48,428
Dude!

959
01:06:48,504 --> 01:06:51,268
Woo-hoo!

960
01:06:55,111 --> 01:06:56,271
- Bye-ya.
- Later.

961
01:06:56,345 --> 01:06:57,869
- Call you guys later.
- Sweet.

962
01:06:57,947 --> 01:06:59,346
Maybe. Maybe not.
Depends.

963
01:06:59,415 --> 01:07:00,575
- Poot?
- Yes.

964
01:07:00,649 --> 01:07:02,617
- We have a lot to review.
- We do?

965
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:03,947
Bye, geeks, I'm out.

966
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:05,385
- Later.
- See ya.

967
01:07:06,188 --> 01:07:07,416
When is your prom?

968
01:07:07,490 --> 01:07:10,357
I need time, dates, transportation.

969
01:07:10,426 --> 01:07:12,291
And you better be
getting me a corsage.

970
01:07:12,361 --> 01:07:14,295
Are you kidding me?
She's a bitch.

971
01:07:14,363 --> 01:07:15,625
- Dude.
- What?

972
01:07:15,698 --> 01:07:18,394
You heard me, Miss Bossy Booty.
I don't like how you act.

973
01:07:18,467 --> 01:07:19,934
I totally
hate you right now.

974
01:07:21,804 --> 01:07:24,466
Uh, see, what Frank is
really tryin' to say is,

975
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:27,168
um, it would be my honor.

976
01:07:27,243 --> 01:07:28,767
You think I'm a bitch?

977
01:07:31,213 --> 01:07:33,443
No.

978
01:07:33,516 --> 01:07:35,040
Yeah, kinda, I do.

979
01:07:35,117 --> 01:07:37,984
But I don't have the problem
with it that Frank does.

980
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:39,954
I mean, he's gay.

981
01:07:43,793 --> 01:07:46,557
- Call me.
- Stalk you.

982
01:07:50,232 --> 01:07:52,223
Dude, I don't even
know you anymore.

983
01:07:53,135 --> 01:07:54,397
What's a corsage?

984
01:07:54,470 --> 01:07:57,234
Universal sign for...
... whipped.

985
01:07:57,306 --> 01:07:59,433
Dude, what's so wrong
about bein' whipped?

986
01:07:59,508 --> 01:08:01,738
When is that
a bad thing? Ever?

987
01:08:01,811 --> 01:08:04,177
Huh. Good point.

988
01:08:05,281 --> 01:08:07,044
<i># I'm going to prom</i>

989
01:08:07,116 --> 01:08:08,947
<i># I'm going to prom
I'm going to prom #</i>

990
01:08:09,018 --> 01:08:10,918
I'm going to prom.
Can you believe it?

991
01:08:10,986 --> 01:08:13,284
Mommy, I'm going to prom.

992
01:08:13,355 --> 01:08:15,653
- No. No. No.
- I'm going to prom.

993
01:08:15,724 --> 01:08:16,986
Josie.

994
01:08:17,059 --> 01:08:19,084
We did not...
Stop dancing.

995
01:08:19,161 --> 01:08:21,356
Stop it!

996
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:24,729
We did not move here from
Wichita so you could go to prom.

997
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:26,427
I just wanna go to one prom.

998
01:08:26,502 --> 01:08:28,936
They don't give out
tiaras at Championships.

999
01:08:29,004 --> 01:08:33,441
We moved here so you
could go to the Olympics.

1000
01:08:33,509 --> 01:08:35,204
- Phyllis.
- Mom.

1001
01:08:35,277 --> 01:08:37,541
The Olympics are ages away.

1002
01:08:37,613 --> 01:08:39,342
Prom is, like, any minute.

1003
01:08:39,415 --> 01:08:40,905
- OK.
- Phyllis.

1004
01:08:40,983 --> 01:08:43,247
You are a 24-hour gymnast.

1005
01:08:43,319 --> 01:08:45,150
Not part-time.
Full-time.

1006
01:08:45,221 --> 01:08:46,313
I know.

1007
01:08:46,388 --> 01:08:49,824
- Phyllis.
- And... we have an agreement

1008
01:08:49,892 --> 01:08:51,359
that you agreed to honor.

1009
01:08:52,394 --> 01:08:55,261
You are not going to the prom.
End of discussion.

1010
01:08:55,331 --> 01:08:56,696
- OK.
- May I?

1011
01:08:58,033 --> 01:09:01,594
Phyllis, now Joanne
is a lovely gymnast.

1012
01:09:01,670 --> 01:09:04,002
I think we oughta get real
about her chances

1013
01:09:04,073 --> 01:09:05,472
of making the Olympic team.

1014
01:09:08,410 --> 01:09:14,315
The only reason we're here
is because we agreed

1015
01:09:14,383 --> 01:09:18,012
that she'd be going
to the Olympics.

1016
01:09:18,587 --> 01:09:21,454
I know. I know.

1017
01:09:21,524 --> 01:09:23,151
I, uh...

1018
01:09:26,162 --> 01:09:28,824
I guess I lied. Hmm?

1019
01:09:32,668 --> 01:09:34,431
Look, everyone...

1020
01:09:34,503 --> 01:09:37,529
Everyone wants to hear
that their kid is special.

1021
01:09:37,606 --> 01:09:39,540
And they are.

1022
01:09:39,608 --> 01:09:43,169
And maybe they're
going to the Olympics.

1023
01:09:43,245 --> 01:09:45,008
- "Maybe. "
- Yes. Maybe they will.

1024
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:47,742
We don't pay for "maybe. "

1025
01:09:47,816 --> 01:09:51,252
People told me I was nuts
to bring Joanne here.

1026
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:54,255
And they were right.

1027
01:09:54,323 --> 01:09:58,623
I'm just glad that I'm
getting her out of here in one piece.

1028
01:09:58,694 --> 01:10:01,993
A coach who's a has-been

1029
01:10:02,064 --> 01:10:05,329
doesn't coach champions.

1030
01:10:05,401 --> 01:10:08,131
He just makes more has-beens.

1031
01:10:08,871 --> 01:10:09,929
Goodbye, Burt.

1032
01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:14,031
You will miss me.

1033
01:10:15,578 --> 01:10:17,910
Championships are three weeks away.

1034
01:10:17,980 --> 01:10:20,448
- Where we gonna go?
- I'll coach you myself.

1035
01:10:21,450 --> 01:10:23,281
I thought you
wanted her to win.

1036
01:10:24,453 --> 01:10:27,047
And what would you know
about winning?

1037
01:10:29,558 --> 01:10:33,221
Joanne. You're more
than welcome to stay.

1038
01:10:34,863 --> 01:10:36,854
Josie, let's go.

1039
01:10:45,407 --> 01:10:48,774
I think I'm gonna
go to prom first.

1040
01:11:05,361 --> 01:11:07,795
Are you OK?

1041
01:11:07,863 --> 01:11:11,526
Oh, it's just... I haven't
had four girls qualify

1042
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,693
for Championships
in a long time.

1043
01:11:14,370 --> 01:11:16,031
Define "long. "

1044
01:11:16,105 --> 01:11:20,769
Actually, I haven't
had four girls qualify...

1045
01:11:20,843 --> 01:11:22,834
...ever.

1046
01:11:24,513 --> 01:11:26,242
Are you gonna cry?

1047
01:11:27,383 --> 01:11:28,850
No, I'm not gonna cry.

1048
01:11:28,917 --> 01:11:30,179
It's just...

1049
01:11:30,252 --> 01:11:33,483
It's a nice thing.
It's beautiful.

1050
01:11:33,555 --> 01:11:36,956
- Jesus, Hay.
- What? You can cry.

1051
01:11:37,026 --> 01:11:39,119
Doesn't make you
any less of a man, Vicki.

1052
01:11:39,194 --> 01:11:40,923
Come on,
I won't tell the parents.

1053
01:11:47,569 --> 01:11:51,300
Welcome to the Neutrogena
National Gymnastics Championships.

1054
01:11:51,373 --> 01:11:53,466
Hello, everybody.
I'm Tim Dagget,

1055
01:11:53,542 --> 01:11:55,533
joined along
with Elfi Schlegel.

1056
01:11:55,611 --> 01:11:59,069
It is two days of gymnastics
competition on tap.

1057
01:11:59,148 --> 01:12:00,843
Today, the all-around finals.

1058
01:12:00,916 --> 01:12:03,908
Day two, the individual event finals.

1059
01:12:03,986 --> 01:12:06,648
Think of the difference
as a jack-of-all-trades

1060
01:12:06,722 --> 01:12:09,452
versus an individual-event specialist.

1061
01:12:09,525 --> 01:12:11,390
She should do her routine
then warm up.

1062
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:13,587
- They stretched.
- They need to warm up.

1063
01:12:13,662 --> 01:12:15,254
- No.
- They've been stretching.

1064
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:17,822
Oh, crap.

1065
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:21,961
Hm, Vickerman. Must be
some crutches around somewhere.

1066
01:12:22,037 --> 01:12:23,971
Tonight, the all-around competition,

1067
01:12:24,039 --> 01:12:27,167
where the top six qualify
for a berth on the World Team.

1068
01:12:27,242 --> 01:12:29,472
The longtime favorite,
Tricia Skilken,

1069
01:12:29,545 --> 01:12:32,036
is hoping to make her
fifth and final World Team

1070
01:12:32,114 --> 01:12:34,275
before her retirement.

1071
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:37,080
While gymnastics wild child,
Haley Graham, has come out

1072
01:12:37,152 --> 01:12:39,677
of retirement to try to
make it for the second time.

1073
01:12:39,755 --> 01:12:42,849
Will her pyrotechnics
rise to the occasion?

1074
01:12:42,925 --> 01:12:44,950
Or will she simply flame out?

1075
01:12:45,027 --> 01:12:47,222
Few can forget
Haley Graham's walkout

1076
01:12:47,296 --> 01:12:49,526
of the World Championships
two years ago.

1077
01:12:49,598 --> 01:12:51,657
Haley was last to go
on the floor exercise

1078
01:12:51,734 --> 01:12:54,828
when she shocked fans
and teammates by exiting the arena

1079
01:12:54,903 --> 01:12:57,872
and walking into an
automatic disqualification.

1080
01:12:57,940 --> 01:12:59,874
That stroll knocked Team USA

1081
01:12:59,942 --> 01:13:03,378
completely out of medal position.
If ever there was a score to settle,

1082
01:13:03,445 --> 01:13:05,811
it's between Tricia Skilken
and Haley Graham.

1083
01:13:05,881 --> 01:13:07,314
Tricia.

1084
01:13:09,318 --> 01:13:11,309
I didn't mean
to wreck your Worlds.

1085
01:13:11,387 --> 01:13:13,412
Mine was disintegrating and...

1086
01:13:13,489 --> 01:13:16,219
I wrote you a note, apologizing.

1087
01:13:16,291 --> 01:13:18,987
I don't know
if you got it or not.

1088
01:13:21,263 --> 01:13:24,755
We have a tremendous amount
of talented athletes out on the floor.

1089
01:13:24,833 --> 01:13:28,997
One of them, Haley Graham, brings
a lot of potential to this US team.

1090
01:13:29,071 --> 01:13:32,563
She could medal internationally
on virtually all of the apparatus.

1091
01:13:32,641 --> 01:13:35,109
Super power, huge difficulty,

1092
01:13:35,177 --> 01:13:37,668
but she is not known
for her consistency.

1093
01:13:37,746 --> 01:13:40,772
And, Elfi, when you get right
down to it, in gymnastics,

1094
01:13:40,849 --> 01:13:43,682
consistency over flash
is what rules the day.

1095
01:13:43,752 --> 01:13:46,414
And, Tim, we have
to remember that for Haley,

1096
01:13:46,488 --> 01:13:49,150
it's her record
and her reputation that will

1097
01:13:49,224 --> 01:13:51,556
really be the only thing
stopping them

1098
01:13:51,627 --> 01:13:54,653
from handing her that valuable
one-way ticket to Rome

1099
01:13:54,730 --> 01:13:57,392
and the World Championships,
later on this year.

1100
01:14:01,103 --> 01:14:03,162
<i>It's the
same old Championships,</i>

1101
01:14:03,238 --> 01:14:05,399
<i>but I am a totally
different person.</i>

1102
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:10,704
<i>And even though I'm pretty
sure that I'll be judged</i>

1103
01:14:10,779 --> 01:14:12,747
<i>for who I was
and not who I am,</i>

1104
01:14:12,815 --> 01:14:14,180
<i>I know I have to face this.</i>

1105
01:14:20,489 --> 01:14:22,423
<i>Four events and
four judges per event.</i>

1106
01:14:22,491 --> 01:14:25,983
<i>That's 16 judges ready to
tell us just how badly we suck.</i>

1107
01:14:26,061 --> 01:14:30,088
<i>Sixteen people ready to tell us
just how perfect we're not.</i>

1108
01:14:30,165 --> 01:14:33,828
<i>But here we are...
chasing perfection.</i>

1109
01:14:35,771 --> 01:14:38,569
<i>The problem is,
perfection doesn't exist.</i>

1110
01:14:40,509 --> 01:14:42,636
<i>But just try telling that
to the judges.</i>

1111
01:14:50,819 --> 01:14:52,218
Where'd ya find deductions?

1112
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:54,448
- The floor? Trash?
- 'Scuse me? Can you move?

1113
01:14:54,523 --> 01:14:58,482
Very clever. No, we decided her start
value is a nine-point-eight, not a ten.

1114
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:02,394
You know the strength required for that?
You realize what you're doin' to her?

1115
01:15:02,464 --> 01:15:04,625
- I'm quite aware.
- This about her routine?

1116
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:06,565
We don't want to encourage the girls

1117
01:15:06,635 --> 01:15:09,195
to attempt such a
dangerous skill and risk injury.

1118
01:15:09,271 --> 01:15:12,069
Surely, you know,
with your track record,

1119
01:15:12,140 --> 01:15:14,973
you could understand that.
I mean, probably, anyway.

1120
01:15:15,043 --> 01:15:17,637
- I understand. Believe me.
- Could you move, please?

1121
01:15:20,282 --> 01:15:23,149
<i>Doesn't matter how
hard we run or how high we flip.</i>

1122
01:15:23,218 --> 01:15:26,654
<i>Leave your hands
on the vault table too long, deduction.</i>

1123
01:15:26,722 --> 01:15:29,316
<i>If you use one arm instead
of two, big deduction.</i>

1124
01:15:29,391 --> 01:15:30,881
<i>And if your feet
clip the vault</i>

1125
01:15:30,959 --> 01:15:34,156
<i>before they hit the floor...
you're done.</i>

1126
01:15:34,229 --> 01:15:36,629
<i>So you say you want lyrics
in your floor music?</i>

1127
01:15:36,698 --> 01:15:38,893
<i>Huge deduction.</i>

1128
01:15:38,967 --> 01:15:40,525
<i>Music finishes,
but you don't?</i>

1129
01:15:40,602 --> 01:15:41,933
<i>Two-tenths deduction.</i>

1130
01:15:44,306 --> 01:15:46,137
<i>It doesn't matter
how well you do.</i>

1131
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:48,403
<i>It's how well
you follow their rules.</i>

1132
01:15:48,477 --> 01:15:51,469
<i>And that just blows.</i>

1133
01:15:51,547 --> 01:15:53,481
It's a little bit crazy, Elfi,

1134
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:57,349
that Nastia Liukin threw
a quad twist on floor exercise

1135
01:15:57,419 --> 01:15:59,683
and got a deduction
on a silly technicality.

1136
01:15:59,755 --> 01:16:01,017
I can't believe it.

1137
01:16:01,089 --> 01:16:04,388
It's a commentary on judging
and how it's gotta change.

1138
01:16:04,459 --> 01:16:07,519
Haley Graham gave the
performance of her life tonight.

1139
01:16:07,596 --> 01:16:10,565
No way she should've ended up
seventh in the standing.

1140
01:16:10,632 --> 01:16:13,123
She might've been
shut out of the all-around,

1141
01:16:13,201 --> 01:16:16,068
but judges can't keep her
outta the event finals tomorrow.

1142
01:16:16,138 --> 01:16:17,503
Tricia, congratulations.

1143
01:16:17,573 --> 01:16:20,303
How does this win compare
to other competitions for you?

1144
01:16:20,375 --> 01:16:23,469
It felt so great. I just wanted
to go in and hit four for four

1145
01:16:23,545 --> 01:16:25,513
and qualify for Worlds
one last time.

1146
01:16:25,581 --> 01:16:27,708
And, um, winning was
just icing on the cake.

1147
01:16:27,783 --> 01:16:29,478
What about
Haley Graham out there?

1148
01:16:29,551 --> 01:16:32,543
Given your history,
how did it feel competing with her?

1149
01:16:32,621 --> 01:16:34,748
It was so great
competing with Haley again.

1150
01:16:34,823 --> 01:16:37,053
Um, I wish her
all the very best.

1151
01:16:37,125 --> 01:16:39,252
- OK. Good luck in the future.
- Thank you.

1152
01:16:39,328 --> 01:16:40,989
Your routines were amazing.

1153
01:16:41,063 --> 01:16:43,156
You'll win floor at
event finals for sure.

1154
01:16:43,231 --> 01:16:46,689
- No. I didn't even qualify.
- That is so lame.

1155
01:16:46,768 --> 01:16:48,929
Boo-hoo.
Stop whining.

1156
01:16:49,004 --> 01:16:51,768
- Diva.
- Dee-vil.

1157
01:16:58,780 --> 01:17:01,214
I think you are a very good coach.

1158
01:17:01,283 --> 01:17:03,410
- Really?
- I do.

1159
01:17:03,485 --> 01:17:05,578
A little action in the back section?

1160
01:17:05,654 --> 01:17:07,645
- That's not too bad.
- Not... not good.

1161
01:17:07,723 --> 01:17:10,157
I wouldn't, ya know...
Oh, yikes. Those two.

1162
01:17:10,225 --> 01:17:12,318
I worked with her last year.
Nightmare.

1163
01:17:12,394 --> 01:17:13,884
On Elm Street.

1164
01:17:13,962 --> 01:17:17,329
Have you seen her face?

1165
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:20,191
- Hey. Scotch. Neat, please.
- Yes, sir.

1166
01:17:20,268 --> 01:17:22,532
Hey, Burt, how ya doin'?
Good job today.

1167
01:17:23,538 --> 01:17:25,768
That Haley is a handful,
isn't she?

1168
01:17:25,841 --> 01:17:27,638
What do ya mean?

1169
01:17:27,709 --> 01:17:30,109
Oh, come on, Burt,
I built that kid.

1170
01:17:30,178 --> 01:17:33,636
I mean, you can glom on for the ride,
but everyone knows who built her.

1171
01:17:33,715 --> 01:17:34,943
Make no mistake, buddy.

1172
01:17:35,017 --> 01:17:36,917
Yeah, that "kid"...

1173
01:17:36,985 --> 01:17:40,421
That kid is here
in spite of you, Chris.

1174
01:17:41,023 --> 01:17:42,615
You're kidding.

1175
01:17:42,691 --> 01:17:44,056
You know,

1176
01:17:44,126 --> 01:17:46,185
if I didn't have
four girls competing,

1177
01:17:46,261 --> 01:17:49,287
I'd kick your ass for thinking
you had anything to do with her.

1178
01:17:49,364 --> 01:17:50,831
She might not have medaled,

1179
01:17:50,899 --> 01:17:52,764
but at least she can
still walk, right?

1180
01:17:55,671 --> 01:17:57,639
Good job, Burt.

1181
01:18:04,579 --> 01:18:06,513
Unbelievable.

1182
01:18:10,118 --> 01:18:12,609
<i>Every girl here
wants the same thing:</i>

1183
01:18:12,688 --> 01:18:15,623
<i>To justify this
crazy thing we do</i>

1184
01:18:15,691 --> 01:18:17,659
<i>and stand on that podium
and be the best.</i>

1185
01:18:17,726 --> 01:18:20,752
<i>And we want it so bad we will
fight each other for it.</i>

1186
01:18:22,464 --> 01:18:24,557
<i>But who are we really
competing against?</i>

1187
01:18:24,633 --> 01:18:26,430
<i>I mean, we all wanna win,</i>

1188
01:18:26,501 --> 01:18:28,526
<i>but should we be
fighting each other...</i>

1189
01:18:31,406 --> 01:18:33,033
<i>...or the officials?</i>

1190
01:18:33,108 --> 01:18:36,407
<i>You know, maybe they judge us
so harshly because of one thing:</i>

1191
01:18:36,478 --> 01:18:40,107
<i>They really wanna be like us.
I mean, everyone knows...</i>

1192
01:18:40,182 --> 01:18:42,207
<i>...they're just jealous.</i>

1193
01:18:47,389 --> 01:18:48,720
Phyllis?

1194
01:18:48,790 --> 01:18:50,883
- Alice!
- How are you?

1195
01:18:50,959 --> 01:18:52,392
Oh!

1196
01:18:52,461 --> 01:18:53,860
Did you have
work done?

1197
01:18:53,929 --> 01:18:56,022
You look great.
I'll see ya later.

1198
01:18:56,098 --> 01:18:57,588
- Thanks!
- We'll talk later?

1199
01:18:57,666 --> 01:18:59,190
That's not an answer.

1200
01:18:59,267 --> 01:19:01,428
First up on vault is Mina Hoyt.

1201
01:19:01,503 --> 01:19:02,800
And, Elfi, she is vaulting

1202
01:19:02,871 --> 01:19:05,032
a handspring
double front somersault.

1203
01:19:05,107 --> 01:19:07,735
Has a start value out of a 10.0.

1204
01:19:07,809 --> 01:19:10,039
Very few gymnasts
perform this vault

1205
01:19:10,112 --> 01:19:12,546
because it is so
incredibly difficult.

1206
01:19:12,614 --> 01:19:15,344
I haven't seen one done
since Produnova of Russia

1207
01:19:15,417 --> 01:19:17,851
dominated with it
nearly a decade ago.

1208
01:19:17,919 --> 01:19:20,752
Her body will flip over
three times in the air

1209
01:19:20,822 --> 01:19:22,847
and somehow
find the floor.

1210
01:19:22,924 --> 01:19:25,051
Tim, I just saw
her do it moments ago

1211
01:19:25,127 --> 01:19:28,062
in the warm-up.
It is unbelievable.

1212
01:19:28,130 --> 01:19:30,155
Come on, Mina.
Let's go.

1213
01:19:30,232 --> 01:19:32,666
Let's go, Mina.

1214
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:53,078
Go, Mina!

1215
01:19:53,155 --> 01:19:55,646
That was incredible.

1216
01:19:55,724 --> 01:19:58,659
The height, the distance.
Bam! The stuck landing.

1217
01:19:58,727 --> 01:20:01,890
If they don't give her a ten
on this, there is no justice.

1218
01:20:01,963 --> 01:20:03,555
Come on, judges,
give her a ten.

1219
01:20:03,632 --> 01:20:05,156
How can they not?

1220
01:20:07,302 --> 01:20:08,929
What?

1221
01:20:09,004 --> 01:20:11,438
Elfi. Whoa,
I can't believe it.

1222
01:20:11,506 --> 01:20:14,498
A nine-five?
This is an outrage.

1223
01:20:14,576 --> 01:20:17,636
- Tim, I'm shocked.
- Oh, crap.

1224
01:20:18,079 --> 01:20:20,240
You're not supposed
to be up here, Burt.

1225
01:20:20,315 --> 01:20:22,840
Where is this deduction
coming from? Hmm?

1226
01:20:24,319 --> 01:20:27,584
Her bra strap
was showing, Burt.

1227
01:20:27,656 --> 01:20:29,351
It's an automatic deduction...

1228
01:20:29,424 --> 01:20:31,654
- Come on!
... if an undergarment's showing.

1229
01:20:31,726 --> 01:20:32,886
That rule...

1230
01:20:32,961 --> 01:20:36,089
Doris, she's
flipping through the air.

1231
01:20:36,164 --> 01:20:39,133
She's spinning, Doris.
Of course her bra popped out.

1232
01:20:39,201 --> 01:20:41,169
That rule is ancient.

1233
01:20:41,236 --> 01:20:43,830
Apparently, so is her bra.

1234
01:20:48,710 --> 01:20:50,735
Don't make me
red card you, Burt.

1235
01:20:50,812 --> 01:20:52,939
I really don't
wanna red card you, OK?

1236
01:20:53,014 --> 01:20:57,508
Vick.
Vick, don't. Come on.

1237
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:00,654
Even I think that's low.

1238
01:21:00,722 --> 01:21:03,486
And I should be happy.
I mean, I wanna win.

1239
01:21:04,893 --> 01:21:07,293
Your bra was sticking out.

1240
01:21:08,496 --> 01:21:11,556
One-tenth off
because her bra was sticking out.

1241
01:21:13,468 --> 01:21:14,958
I've never even heard of that.

1242
01:21:15,036 --> 01:21:17,095
They didn't deduct her
because of her bra.

1243
01:21:17,172 --> 01:21:19,732
They deducted her
because I'm her coach.

1244
01:21:21,109 --> 01:21:23,043
Come on, Haley. You're up.

1245
01:21:23,111 --> 01:21:25,204
This is where
the sport loses fans.

1246
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:27,942
The system, the judging,
it's too confusing.

1247
01:21:28,016 --> 01:21:30,541
The crowd just saw
a spectacular skill.

1248
01:21:30,619 --> 01:21:34,578
They don't understand
why a gymnast is not rewarded for it.

1249
01:21:34,656 --> 01:21:36,851
- That's wrong.
- Come on. You got it.

1250
01:21:44,833 --> 01:21:46,391
Come on, Haley.

1251
01:21:58,580 --> 01:22:00,445
Come on, Haley.

1252
01:22:29,344 --> 01:22:30,538
Did she just scratch?

1253
01:22:30,612 --> 01:22:34,981
An intentional scratch
from Haley Graham in event finals.

1254
01:22:35,050 --> 01:22:37,143
This has never happened before.

1255
01:22:40,956 --> 01:22:42,548
Way to stick it.

1256
01:22:42,624 --> 01:22:45,991
Next time you should
stick out your tongue too.

1257
01:22:46,061 --> 01:22:49,724
I would, but my coach likes it
when I control my tricks.

1258
01:22:56,504 --> 01:22:57,937
That was for you.

1259
01:22:59,007 --> 01:23:01,066
Come on, Joanne.
Let's get out there.

1260
01:23:03,244 --> 01:23:07,146
- Come on. You got it.
- Joanne!

1261
01:23:27,702 --> 01:23:30,330
She is walking
down the runway?

1262
01:23:30,405 --> 01:23:33,306
There is something really weird
going on here today, Elfi.

1263
01:23:33,375 --> 01:23:35,172
You can say
that again, Tim.

1264
01:23:35,243 --> 01:23:38,906
There is something really
weird going on here today, Elfi.

1265
01:23:43,485 --> 01:23:46,613
Elfi, I have
never seen this before.

1266
01:23:46,688 --> 01:23:49,782
Back-to-back athletes
scratching intentionally.

1267
01:24:06,374 --> 01:24:09,639
Beautiful! Beautiful.

1268
01:24:10,979 --> 01:24:13,072
I couldn't let you have
all the attention.

1269
01:24:23,591 --> 01:24:26,151
'Cause of the scratching,
looks like Mina Hoyt

1270
01:24:26,227 --> 01:24:28,559
is going to be the
new national vault champion.

1271
01:24:28,630 --> 01:24:30,689
This is unprecedented.

1272
01:24:31,666 --> 01:24:33,190
My God, I'm the new vault champ.

1273
01:24:33,268 --> 01:24:34,292
- I know!
- Woo!

1274
01:24:34,369 --> 01:24:36,064
And I loved not going.

1275
01:24:36,137 --> 01:24:40,005
I mean, if we chose
the winner on every event,

1276
01:24:40,075 --> 01:24:43,567
we could actually control
the results for a change.

1277
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:47,271
Oh, my God, you're right.

1278
01:24:49,184 --> 01:24:51,152
Since when
are you brilliant?

1279
01:24:51,219 --> 01:24:53,949
I don't know.
Since now.

1280
01:24:54,022 --> 01:24:58,356
You guys, we are going to
scratch and let Nastia...

1281
01:24:58,426 --> 01:25:00,394
- Yeah. Absolutely.
- She's the best.

1282
01:25:10,505 --> 01:25:12,735
- This is ridiculous.
- Woo!

1283
01:25:15,110 --> 01:25:17,544
Whoo! Good job, Gloria!

1284
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:35,120
The judges are
trying to figure out

1285
01:25:35,196 --> 01:25:38,393
what is gonna happen.
I'm not so sure either, Elfi.

1286
01:25:38,466 --> 01:25:40,696
- Come on, Nastia!
- She's goin' for it.

1287
01:25:40,768 --> 01:25:42,633
Well, we've seen five athletes,

1288
01:25:42,704 --> 01:25:44,831
and no one's done that,
there, an element.

1289
01:25:44,906 --> 01:25:47,272
That means that she is
going to be the uneven bar

1290
01:25:47,342 --> 01:25:50,311
champion just by that skill alone.

1291
01:26:07,929 --> 01:26:09,419
Whoo-hoo!

1292
01:26:09,497 --> 01:26:12,557
Way to go, Nastia!
Amazing. She's amazing.

1293
01:26:12,634 --> 01:26:14,363
- I'm so glad we picked her.
- Whoo!

1294
01:26:14,435 --> 01:26:16,562
- I'm so glad we picked her.
- Picked her?

1295
01:26:33,988 --> 01:26:36,013
Unreal.
That rocked.

1296
01:26:36,090 --> 01:26:39,992
Nastia Liukin will be
the new uneven bar champion.

1297
01:26:40,061 --> 01:26:41,653
Well, the athletes have spoken.

1298
01:26:41,729 --> 01:26:45,790
And there will be no silver,
no bronze medals on bars today.

1299
01:26:45,867 --> 01:26:47,664
Thanks.

1300
01:26:47,735 --> 01:26:49,532
It was everybody.

1301
01:26:49,604 --> 01:26:53,472
After what happened to Nastia
Liukin and Wei Wei Yong yesterday

1302
01:26:53,541 --> 01:26:55,008
and Mina Hoyt today,

1303
01:26:55,076 --> 01:26:58,273
it's safe to say the athletes
are sending the judges a message.

1304
01:26:58,346 --> 01:26:59,870
This is historic, Tim.

1305
01:26:59,948 --> 01:27:03,281
I've never seen this kind of
organized rebellion before.

1306
01:27:03,351 --> 01:27:07,048
Are you going to tell me who is
going to compete and who isn't?

1307
01:27:09,023 --> 01:27:11,321
You're not going
to tell me, are you?

1308
01:27:14,262 --> 01:27:15,524
Oops.

1309
01:27:17,432 --> 01:27:20,560
'Cause there are alternates
who would like to compete.

1310
01:27:24,939 --> 01:27:28,375
They can't do anything.
He's trying to save his butt.

1311
01:27:32,280 --> 01:27:36,114
Tricia's gonna compete.
So selfish.

1312
01:27:37,051 --> 01:27:39,781
Game over.

1313
01:27:47,962 --> 01:27:51,420
I don't have to go. I can scratch,
and we can still make our point.

1314
01:27:51,499 --> 01:27:54,093
No, no, no, we picked you.
We wanna see your routine.

1315
01:27:54,168 --> 01:27:55,658
It's your call.

1316
01:27:58,206 --> 01:28:01,107
OK. Cool.

1317
01:28:02,310 --> 01:28:04,471
We have seen
scratch after scratch.

1318
01:28:04,545 --> 01:28:07,013
The meet director,
prior to this event,

1319
01:28:07,081 --> 01:28:10,141
he decided to put in
the alternate, Tricia Skilken,

1320
01:28:10,218 --> 01:28:13,085
because he thought for sure
he'd get a routine out of her.

1321
01:28:13,154 --> 01:28:14,246
We'll see.

1322
01:28:14,322 --> 01:28:17,416
Here comes her big
acrobatic moment right here.

1323
01:28:17,492 --> 01:28:18,823
Connected together.

1324
01:28:18,893 --> 01:28:22,056
Two aerial skills,
very nicely done.

1325
01:28:22,130 --> 01:28:25,065
Is this how you feel
when you watch my routine?

1326
01:28:25,133 --> 01:28:27,067
Uh, yeah.

1327
01:28:27,835 --> 01:28:30,633
I am so sorry.

1328
01:28:30,705 --> 01:28:34,266
She's looking
really secure in this routine.

1329
01:28:34,342 --> 01:28:36,674
Vary exact in all her movements.

1330
01:28:36,744 --> 01:28:38,837
Now, she does do
a very interesting skill

1331
01:28:38,913 --> 01:28:40,175
that's coming up here.

1332
01:28:40,248 --> 01:28:43,308
Two in a row. Nicely done.
Illusions, they're called.

1333
01:28:43,384 --> 01:28:46,444
What'd I miss?
Just kidding.

1334
01:28:48,990 --> 01:28:50,617
Just the dismount left.

1335
01:28:51,826 --> 01:28:54,226
Double twist. Excellent job.

1336
01:29:00,201 --> 01:29:01,759
Why don't you just make out.

1337
01:29:01,836 --> 01:29:04,600
Whaddya think, huh, Wei Wei?
Beat that.

1338
01:29:06,541 --> 01:29:09,066
Oh! I'm so shakin' things up.

1339
01:29:09,143 --> 01:29:10,269
That's right.

1340
01:29:10,345 --> 01:29:12,711
- Come on. You got this.
- Let's see what ya got.

1341
01:29:12,780 --> 01:29:15,874
- Come on, Wei Wei!
- Come on, Wei Wei! Whoo!

1342
01:29:15,950 --> 01:29:18,475
I think the judges
are trying to figure out

1343
01:29:18,553 --> 01:29:21,488
what is gonna happen.
I'm not so sure either, Elfi.

1344
01:29:21,556 --> 01:29:22,887
She's goin' for it.

1345
01:29:22,957 --> 01:29:25,517
Yeah, looks like
we got another routine.

1346
01:29:28,996 --> 01:29:30,588
Good job!

1347
01:29:32,567 --> 01:29:34,558
All right, Wei Wei!

1348
01:29:42,443 --> 01:29:44,570
<i>Come Baby Come]</i>

1349
01:30:04,899 --> 01:30:07,231
Whoa!

1350
01:30:56,651 --> 01:30:59,313
It's very original,
but I'm afraid the judges

1351
01:30:59,387 --> 01:31:01,912
won't know what
to do with that routine, Elfi.

1352
01:31:01,989 --> 01:31:04,617
With those scores,
Tricia will get the gold,

1353
01:31:04,692 --> 01:31:07,160
and Wei Wei will
take home a silver.

1354
01:31:08,996 --> 01:31:11,487
So it is old school
versus new school.

1355
01:31:11,566 --> 01:31:14,933
Tricia Skilken,
a longtime judges' favorite.

1356
01:31:15,002 --> 01:31:17,129
- Very consistent.
- Lookin' good.

1357
01:31:17,205 --> 01:31:20,663
In contrast, Haley,
raw power, huge start values,

1358
01:31:20,741 --> 01:31:23,301
but she is not known
for her consistency.

1359
01:31:23,377 --> 01:31:25,937
Elfi, when ya get right
down to it, in gymnastics,

1360
01:31:26,013 --> 01:31:29,039
consistency over flash
is what rules the day.

1361
01:31:29,116 --> 01:31:32,552
Go ahead, scratch.
You're all zeroes anyway.

1362
01:31:35,556 --> 01:31:38,184
Tricia, this is
not about winning.

1363
01:31:38,259 --> 01:31:40,352
I'm not here
to screw you over.

1364
01:31:40,428 --> 01:31:42,828
Oh. Too late.

1365
01:31:42,897 --> 01:31:45,559
Fine. Then I'll scratch
if you want the moment.

1366
01:31:45,633 --> 01:31:47,100
But this?

1367
01:31:47,168 --> 01:31:49,432
This is much bigger
than you and me.

1368
01:31:51,272 --> 01:31:54,366
Well, like we said, they
were warming up their tumbling,

1369
01:31:54,442 --> 01:31:57,843
but we've seen four athletes scratch,
so who knows what

1370
01:31:57,912 --> 01:31:59,311
Haley's gonna decide to do?

1371
01:31:59,380 --> 01:32:02,315
If she's gonna do the whole thing,
if she's gonna do nothin'.

1372
01:32:02,383 --> 01:32:04,283
- Come on!
- I don't have a clue.

1373
01:32:04,352 --> 01:32:07,515
- You got it!
- Go, Haley!

1374
01:32:07,588 --> 01:32:10,421
<i>There are things you
wish for before big moments.</i>

1375
01:32:10,491 --> 01:32:12,755
<i>I wish my friends were here.</i>

1376
01:32:12,827 --> 01:32:16,661
<i>God. I wish
my parents were different.</i>

1377
01:32:16,731 --> 01:32:20,531
<i>I wish there was someone
who got what was happening,</i>

1378
01:32:20,601 --> 01:32:24,162
<i>and could just look at me
and tell me we weren't crazy.</i>

1379
01:32:24,238 --> 01:32:26,433
<i>That we weren't being stupid.</i>

1380
01:32:27,508 --> 01:32:29,442
<i>Someone to say,</i>

1381
01:32:29,510 --> 01:32:31,171
<i>"I'm proud of you.</i>

1382
01:32:31,245 --> 01:32:34,408
<i>And I got your back.
No matter what. "</i>

1383
01:32:34,482 --> 01:32:36,109
Haley, Haley.

1384
01:32:37,985 --> 01:32:39,145
What's wrong?

1385
01:32:39,220 --> 01:32:42,212
Nothing. Listen...

1386
01:32:42,290 --> 01:32:46,727
I, uh... I just
want you to know...

1387
01:32:47,194 --> 01:32:48,855
What?

1388
01:32:48,930 --> 01:32:51,262
That, uh...

1389
01:32:52,967 --> 01:32:55,401
- I'm so...
- Don't.

1390
01:32:55,469 --> 01:32:59,735
No, no, no, no, no.
I'm so...

1391
01:33:00,908 --> 01:33:03,775
...proud to be your coach.

1392
01:33:12,153 --> 01:33:14,678
Now, don't you dare hold back.

1393
01:33:14,755 --> 01:33:17,588
And floor it. Mm-hm?

1394
01:33:18,993 --> 01:33:21,427
Let's go, Haley!
Come on!

1395
01:33:24,498 --> 01:33:27,126
Come on, Haley.
Let it rip!

1396
01:33:34,342 --> 01:33:37,539
<i>[# Fall Out Boy: Our Lawyers Made Us
Change the Name of This Song</i>

1397
01:33:37,712 --> 01:33:39,304
<i>So We Wouldn't Get Sued]</i>

1398
01:33:53,661 --> 01:33:56,494
- Come on!
- You can do it! Come on, Haley!

1399
01:33:56,564 --> 01:33:58,555
Come on, Haley!

1400
01:34:03,371 --> 01:34:04,998
Come on.
Let's see it!

1401
01:34:50,885 --> 01:34:53,012
Go, Haley!

1402
01:34:56,190 --> 01:34:57,885
Yeah, Haley!

1403
01:34:59,460 --> 01:35:02,224
Yeah, Haley!

1404
01:35:28,222 --> 01:35:29,917
Selfish.

1405
01:36:04,191 --> 01:36:05,783
What?

1406
01:36:13,400 --> 01:36:15,493
Whoo!

1407
01:36:20,741 --> 01:36:23,676
<i>As we got our totally
fake first-place medals,</i>

1408
01:36:23,744 --> 01:36:27,976
<i>I realized gymnastics wasn't
there to judge me or dis me.</i>

1409
01:36:28,048 --> 01:36:29,845
<i>Only I could do that.</i>

1410
01:36:29,917 --> 01:36:32,511
<i>I couldn't look back and
think it was about the judges</i>

1411
01:36:32,586 --> 01:36:34,486
<i>or the parents
or the coaches at all.</i>

1412
01:36:34,555 --> 01:36:36,989
<i>It was about us.
And for us.</i>

1413
01:36:37,458 --> 01:36:38,584
Haley!

1414
01:36:38,659 --> 01:36:42,755
<i>And that felt totally
first-place real to me.</i>

1415
01:36:42,830 --> 01:36:46,596
I'm glad it did. It's important
that we controlled the results for once.

1416
01:36:46,667 --> 01:36:48,828
<i>and give the judges...</i>

1417
01:36:48,903 --> 01:36:51,394
Oh, excuse me.

1418
01:36:51,472 --> 01:36:53,633
Hey, what's up?

1419
01:36:53,707 --> 01:36:56,505
Yeah, just one second.
She's right here.

1420
01:36:56,577 --> 01:37:00,104
Technically, I was the second to
scratch, but I got the ball rolling...

1421
01:37:00,181 --> 01:37:02,376
I'm sorry.
Just one second. This is for you.

1422
01:37:02,449 --> 01:37:08,445
Poot? I wanted a pink corsage,
but white will work.

1423
01:37:10,291 --> 01:37:12,225
You'll never guess
what I did today.

1424
01:37:12,293 --> 01:37:14,352
Carly!

1425
01:37:14,428 --> 01:37:16,726
One second, guys.
Would y'all sign my program?

1426
01:37:16,797 --> 01:37:18,697
- Wha?!
- Oh, my gosh...

1427
01:37:18,766 --> 01:37:19,926
...yes!

1428
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:21,467
So amazing.

1429
01:37:21,535 --> 01:37:22,968
Haley. Haley.

1430
01:37:23,037 --> 01:37:24,527
- I need to talk to you.
- OK.

1431
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:28,308
I got some really
bad news to tell ya.

1432
01:37:28,375 --> 01:37:29,808
What?

1433
01:37:29,877 --> 01:37:32,402
How much do ya hate
college gymnastics? Hmm?

1434
01:37:32,479 --> 01:37:35,141
I decided not to hate things
I've never tried.

1435
01:37:35,983 --> 01:37:38,008
All these schools want me?

1436
01:37:38,085 --> 01:37:40,918
- Well, where should I go?
- Eh, you'll figure it out.

1437
01:37:40,988 --> 01:37:44,583
- Maybe I should tell 'em to stick it.
- Yeah, like you know how to stick it.

1438
01:37:44,658 --> 01:37:47,627
- Uh, my feet were glued.
- Yeah, to a high-speed bus.

1439
01:37:47,695 --> 01:37:49,629
You're the one that
told me to floor it.

1440
01:37:49,697 --> 01:37:52,962
Yeah,
you floored it all right.

1441
01:37:57,238 --> 01:37:58,705
Huh?

1442
01:37:59,673 --> 01:38:01,732
You did it, kid.
