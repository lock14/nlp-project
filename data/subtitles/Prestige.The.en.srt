1
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,899
Are you watching closely?

2
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:09,200
Every magic trick consists of three parts, or acts.

3
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,680
The first part is called "the pledge".

4
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:16,120
The magician shows you something ordinary.

5
00:01:16,189 --> 00:01:19,650
A deck of cards, a bird or a man.

6
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,700
He shows you this object.

7
00:01:28,769 --> 00:01:31,359
Perhaps he asks you to inspect it,

8
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,460
to see that it is indeed real,

9
00:01:34,539 --> 00:01:37,599
unaltered, normal.

10
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:44,150
But, of course, it probably isn't.

11
00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:46,009
Where do you think you're going?

12
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,450
I'm part of the bloody act, you fool.

13
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:03,829
The second act is called "the turn".

14
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:21,340
The magician takes the ordinary something

15
00:02:22,949 --> 00:02:26,009
and makes it do something extraordinary.

16
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:34,620
Now you're looking for the secret, but you won't find it,

17
00:02:34,699 --> 00:02:38,530
because, of course, you're not really looking.

18
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:40,229
You don't really want to know.

19
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:45,870
You want to be... fooled.

20
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:49,979
But you wouldn't clap yet,

21
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:54,210
because making something disappear isn't enough.

22
00:02:54,289 --> 00:02:57,879
You have to bring it back.

23
00:02:59,389 --> 00:03:03,159
That's why every magic trick has a third act.

24
00:03:03,229 --> 00:03:04,889
The hardest part.

25
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,490
The part we call...

26
00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:08,900
...".the prestige".

27
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,879
The prestige? And did Robert Angier, the Great Danton, your employer,

28
00:03:23,949 --> 00:03:26,379
get to that final part of his trick that night?

29
00:03:26,449 --> 00:03:28,539
- No, sir. Something went wrong.
- What went wrong?

30
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:33,210
I saw someone making their way below stage.

31
00:03:33,289 --> 00:03:35,189
I followed him.

32
00:03:35,259 --> 00:03:38,520
It was Borden, watching Mr. Angier drown.

33
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:42,030
Would you please describe your occupation to the jury, Mr. Cutter.

34
00:03:42,099 --> 00:03:44,469
I'm an ingèŒ…nieur, I design illusions

35
00:03:44,539 --> 00:03:47,699
and construct the apparatus necessary for performing them.

36
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:52,210
So, Mr. Cutter, was this water-filled tank beneath the stage

37
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,870
part of Mr. Angier's illusion?

38
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:57,810
No. The tank was brought on for the first trick

39
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:59,849
and then taken offstage.

40
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,219
Borden must have placed it under the trap door after the end of it.

41
00:04:03,289 --> 00:04:04,849
How large was this tank?

42
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:07,520
It's a normal tank for escape under water,

43
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:09,719
about 400 or 500 gallons.

44
00:04:09,789 --> 00:04:12,280
How do you think he was able to move the tank

45
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,729
under the trap door without anyone noticing?

46
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,160
He's a magician, ask him.

47
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,329
I ask again,

48
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,629
would this man explain the mechanics of Mr. Angier's illusion.

49
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:25,040
The Real Transported Man is one of the most sought after illusions

50
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:26,300
in this business.

51
00:04:26,379 --> 00:04:27,939
I have the right to sell it on.

52
00:04:28,009 --> 00:04:30,639
If I reveal the method here, the trick is worthless.

53
00:04:30,709 --> 00:04:32,980
How can we know that the tank wasn't simply

54
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:35,519
some part of the trick that went wrong?

55
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:37,649
Mr. Cutter, I see your predicament.

56
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,120
But Alfred Borden's life hangs in the balance.

57
00:04:40,189 --> 00:04:43,350
If you were prepared to disclose the details to me in private,

58
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:46,259
I might be able to judge their relevance to the case.

59
00:04:46,329 --> 00:04:48,959
Might this be an acceptable compromise?

60
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:10,620
I'm going to have to ask you to turn out your pockets.

61
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:18,319
Not my idea, sir. The warden saw his show in Manchester last year

62
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:20,259
where he vanished into thin air.

63
00:05:20,329 --> 00:05:22,819
He's convinced he'll try and escape.

64
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,029
I told him the only way Borden's going to disappear

65
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:31,540
is if I leave him out there with the other inmates.

66
00:05:37,409 --> 00:05:38,750
Check the locks...

67
00:05:40,449 --> 00:05:42,009
...twice.

68
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:51,620
My name is Owens.

69
00:05:51,699 --> 00:05:53,959
I'm a solicitor.

70
00:05:54,029 --> 00:05:57,689
I represent Lord Caldlow, an accomplished amateur magician and...

71
00:05:57,769 --> 00:06:00,360
How much?

72
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:02,769
- He is interested...
- How much for my tricks?

73
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:04,430
Five thousand pounds.

74
00:06:04,509 --> 00:06:07,000
Talk to Fallon, my ingèŒ…nieur. Money's for him.

75
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:10,769
Yes, I did. He offered to sell me your tricks.

76
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:13,720
All except the most valuable one, The Transported Man.

77
00:06:13,779 --> 00:06:17,079
Well, I won't forgive myself for selling my greatest trick.

78
00:06:17,149 --> 00:06:18,589
Even for your daughter?

79
00:06:20,259 --> 00:06:24,589
If you are for the drop, your daughter is going to need looking after.

80
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,389
Fallon will take care of her.

81
00:06:26,459 --> 00:06:28,189
Perfect, Fallon.

82
00:06:28,269 --> 00:06:30,290
A man with a past as obscure as your own.

83
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:35,399
The courts have motioned she be removed from his care. She will be an orphan.

84
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:37,740
I know you're no stranger to the workhouse.

85
00:06:38,509 --> 00:06:40,340
It's better than here?

86
00:06:40,409 --> 00:06:43,639
I'm offering you a way to wrap up your affairs with dignity.

87
00:06:43,709 --> 00:06:45,680
I'm offering your daughter a future.

88
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,779
As Lord Caldlow's ward, she will want for nothing...

89
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:50,680
...ever.

90
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:53,750
Well, think it over.

91
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:57,590
And Lord Caldlow would like you to have this,

92
00:06:57,659 --> 00:07:00,189
as a show of good faith. It might be of interest.

93
00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:03,790
Robert Angier's diary, including the time he spent in Colorado

94
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,129
Iearning your trick.

95
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,899
- He never learned it.
- Really?

96
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:10,500
On his return, he mounted a version of The Transported Man

97
00:07:10,569 --> 00:07:14,529
that the papers said was better even than your original.

98
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:15,910
If you want Angier's secrets,

99
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:21,439
you go dig him up and ask him yourself.

100
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:23,379
I want your secret, Mr. Borden.

101
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,759
Consider your daughter.

102
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,170
A cipher,

103
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:39,259
an enigma...

104
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:43,000
...a search,

105
00:07:43,069 --> 00:07:44,060
a search for answers.

106
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:55,550
Even if Colorado is the end of my journey,

107
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:58,819
it'll take much longer to unravel

108
00:07:58,889 --> 00:08:00,790
the rest of Borden's secrets.

109
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:04,829
See, the cipher in his notebook is

110
00:08:04,899 --> 00:08:07,389
unlocked by a single word,

111
00:08:07,459 --> 00:08:10,430
but it will still take months to translate his writing.

112
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,269
And to know his mind.

113
00:08:16,209 --> 00:08:18,540
Well, my passion is equal to the task.

114
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:35,149
Mr. Angier, welcome to Colorado Springs.

115
00:08:50,539 --> 00:08:53,600
- The whole town has electricity.
- Yes, sir.

116
00:09:10,789 --> 00:09:12,279
Well...

117
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,850
...quite a reception.

118
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:16,419
You're our first guest of the season, Mr. Angier.

119
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,990
Your telegram didn't indicate how long you'd be staying with us.

120
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:21,700
As long as it takes.

121
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:25,039
I will need a coach tomorrow to take me up the mountain.

122
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:26,840
Well, the peak's closed, sir.

123
00:09:26,909 --> 00:09:28,740
For scientific experimentation.

124
00:09:28,809 --> 00:09:30,779
Yes, I know.

125
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:32,139
That's why I'm here.

126
00:09:39,389 --> 00:09:41,620
Whoa. Whoa.

127
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:46,259
You'll have to walk the rest, I'm afraid, sir.

128
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:25,029
I'm amazed how many of you newspaper writers

129
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,159
can't read my sign.

130
00:10:31,909 --> 00:10:34,500
Not the welcome I was expecting.

131
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,539
I know you.

132
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,039
You're the Great Danton.

133
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,419
I saw your show in London.

134
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:50,259
Seven times you guessed every object

135
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:52,559
the audience had in their pockets.

136
00:10:52,629 --> 00:10:56,690
I'm Alley. Sorry about the fence. People keep interfering with our work.

137
00:10:56,769 --> 00:10:59,429
- I've come to see Tesla.
- Why?

138
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:03,559
He made a machine for a colleague of mine some time ago.

139
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:07,129
- Can you get me a meeting with him?
- Impossible, I'm afraid.

140
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:09,440
I've brought a lot of money.

141
00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:11,169
I'm sorry, Mr. Angier.

142
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,909
I simply can't help.

143
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:19,110
I'll be staying at the hotel, indefinitely.

144
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:24,549
Hey, what am I holding?

145
00:11:24,629 --> 00:11:25,929
Your watch.

146
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:34,230
Borden's journal entry for April 3,1897,

147
00:11:34,299 --> 00:11:36,399
describes a show at the Orpheum Theatre.

148
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:39,370
That was just days after he first met me.

149
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:45,480
We were two young men at the start of a great career,

150
00:11:45,549 --> 00:11:47,879
two young men devoted to an illusion,

151
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:50,509
two young men who never intended to hurt anyone.

152
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:52,350
Which of you brave souls

153
00:11:52,419 --> 00:11:55,149
is willing to bind this lovely young woman?

154
00:11:56,929 --> 00:11:58,860
Me!

155
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,860
If you would tie her wrists,

156
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:11,840
bind her feet...

157
00:12:11,909 --> 00:12:14,429
...around the ankle.

158
00:12:14,509 --> 00:12:16,600
Are either of you two gentlemen sailors?

159
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:18,509
- No.
- No.

160
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,409
I'm sure you can both tie a strong knot.

161
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,110
He's complacent, he's predictable, he's boring.

162
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:31,750
Milton has gotten success, whatever that means,

163
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:35,049
so now he's scared. He won't take any risks at all.

164
00:13:35,129 --> 00:13:38,190
He's squandering the goodwill of his audience with tired,

165
00:13:38,259 --> 00:13:40,860
- second-rate tricks...
- They're all favorites.

166
00:13:40,929 --> 00:13:44,419
Give me something fresh. He won't even try a bloody bullet catch.

167
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,330
A bullet catch is suicide.

168
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,399
All it takes is some smartass volunteer to put a button in the barrel.

169
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:52,740
- Use a plant.
- You can't for every trick.

170
00:13:52,909 --> 00:13:54,779
No seats left for the punters.

171
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:58,649
All right, no bullet catch, whatever, but the point is a real magician

172
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,340
tries to invent something new

173
00:14:00,419 --> 00:14:03,279
that other magicians will scratch their heads over.

174
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:05,549
Then you sell it to him for a small fortune.

175
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:08,720
- What?
- I suppose you have such a trick?

176
00:14:08,789 --> 00:14:11,350
- I sure do.
- Would you care to sell it to me?

177
00:14:11,429 --> 00:14:13,019
No. No one else can do my trick.

178
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,220
- Any trick can be duplicated.
- Wrong.

179
00:14:15,299 --> 00:14:19,029
If Mr. Borden has invented his masterpiece,

180
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,000
he's prepared to do it.

181
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:23,200
Milton is a showman, but Borden is right,

182
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:24,899
he won't get his hands dirty.

183
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:28,539
If you want to see what it takes to make real magic,

184
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:32,450
go to the Tenley. There's a Chinaman there and he really has what it takes.

185
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:34,750
- Chung Ling Soo.
- I can't afford that.

186
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,549
I know the bloke run the door.

187
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:40,950
You two go and see that show, and whichever one of you can tell me

188
00:14:41,019 --> 00:14:44,120
how he does the goldfish bowl trick gets the prize.

189
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:46,460
- Which is?
- Ten minutes onstage

190
00:14:46,529 --> 00:14:48,360
with my old friend, Mr. Ackerman.

191
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:49,860
- Really?
- Who's Ackerman?

192
00:14:49,929 --> 00:14:52,990
The top theatrical agent in London.

193
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:56,059
- I saw you drop the knot again.
- I turned my wrists.

194
00:14:56,139 --> 00:14:58,769
Some nights you just don't get it, do you?

195
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,710
I mean, if that knot slips and Julia's on the hoist,

196
00:15:01,779 --> 00:15:02,870
she'll break her leg.

197
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:04,570
It's the wrong knot.

198
00:15:04,649 --> 00:15:07,519
Like I said, the Langford double will hold tighter.

199
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:11,110
The Langford double isn't a wet knot. It's too dangerous.

200
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:13,419
If the rope swells, she can't slip it.

201
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:16,720
- I can slip a Langford underwater.
- We can practice.

202
00:15:16,789 --> 00:15:20,730
- Borden, he said no.
- Oh, you know knots better than me?

203
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:22,789
Listen, no more mistakes.

204
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:25,559
All right. Yeah? Do you? You want to take over?

205
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:28,570
- Just leave.
- I didn't think so.

206
00:15:33,009 --> 00:15:34,840
Hey, Cutter, where's he from?

207
00:15:34,909 --> 00:15:38,210
Where are you from? He shifts props for Virgil at the hall.

208
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:41,440
- Worried he'll steal your tricks?
- Doesn't deal in methods.

209
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,580
- How do you know?
- Because I hired him

210
00:15:44,649 --> 00:15:47,889
to find out how Virgil does the orange trick.

211
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,289
- I don't trust him.
- He's a natural magician.

212
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,450
'Course you can't trust him.

213
00:15:52,529 --> 00:15:53,889
I think he's all right.

214
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,299
- You think everyone's all right.
- Even you.

215
00:15:56,370 --> 00:16:00,200
Watch your sightlines. If I can see you kiss your wife's leg every night,

216
00:16:00,269 --> 00:16:02,929
so can the blokes at the ends of rows three and four!

217
00:16:35,009 --> 00:16:37,440
You're wrong. It can't be.

218
00:16:37,509 --> 00:16:41,240
- Look at the man.
- This is the trick.

219
00:16:41,309 --> 00:16:43,340
This is the performance. Right here.

220
00:16:43,409 --> 00:16:45,779
This is why no one can detect his method.

221
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:49,139
Total devotion to his art.

222
00:16:50,149 --> 00:16:51,879
A lot of self-sacrifice.

223
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,320
You know.

224
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:57,090
It's the only way to escape...

225
00:16:57,159 --> 00:16:59,590
...all this, you know?

226
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:07,059
I can barely lift this thing and it's not even filled with water.

227
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:11,039
Or fish, look.

228
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:13,369
I don't know. Hang on a second.

229
00:17:15,309 --> 00:17:18,009
He must be strong as an ox.

230
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:23,480
He's been pretending to be a cripple for years.

231
00:17:23,549 --> 00:17:27,150
Any time he's in public, any time he goes out. It's unthinkable.

232
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:30,160
Borden saw it at once. But I couldn't fathom it.

233
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:33,089
Living my whole life pretending to be someone else.

234
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,890
You are pretending.

235
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,990
I don't think changing a name compares.

236
00:17:37,069 --> 00:17:39,539
Not your name. Who you are and where you're from.

237
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:43,559
I promised I wouldn't embarrass my family with my theatrical endeavors.

238
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:47,339
I thought of a name for you.

239
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:52,200
The Great Danton.

240
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:55,250
Do you like it? But it's sophisticated.

241
00:17:55,319 --> 00:17:56,750
It's French.

242
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:06,890
Borden writes as if no one but he understood the true nature of magic.

243
00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:15,269
But what does he know of self-sacrifice?

244
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:22,500
You bloody fool.

245
00:18:50,069 --> 00:18:53,670
- He killed it.
- It's OK.

246
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:57,579
- He killed it.
- He didn't.

247
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:03,349
Look, now he'll bring it back.

248
00:19:05,589 --> 00:19:08,519
- No, he killed it.
- No, he didn't.

249
00:19:16,829 --> 00:19:19,799
Look, see, he's all right. He's fine.

250
00:19:19,869 --> 00:19:23,970
- Look at him.
- But where's his brother?

251
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:29,940
He's a sharp lad, your son.

252
00:19:30,009 --> 00:19:32,609
Oh, he's my nephew.

253
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,170
Ah.

254
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,910
You're the lucky one today.

255
00:20:00,509 --> 00:20:03,670
Are you watching closely?

256
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:07,940
Look closer.

257
00:20:11,019 --> 00:20:12,819
Never show anyone.

258
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:15,619
They'll beg you and flatter you for the secret,

259
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:19,180
but as soon as you give it up, you'll be nothing to them.

260
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:21,529
You understand? Nothing.

261
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:24,660
The secret impresses no one.

262
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:28,329
The trick you use it for is everything.

263
00:20:32,579 --> 00:20:35,509
Well, thank you for lunch, Mr. Borden.

264
00:20:35,579 --> 00:20:37,069
You're welcome.

265
00:20:38,509 --> 00:20:40,180
Alfred, it's Alfred.

266
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,839
Alfred.

267
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,890
So I could use a cup of tea.

268
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:48,480
I can't allow... It's the landlord. It's not...

269
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:53,160
You think that's... Is that enough to keep me out?

270
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:56,460
I think so.

271
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:59,059
So I'll see you again?

272
00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:10,769
Milk and sugar?

273
00:21:31,869 --> 00:21:33,839
What's in there?

274
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,839
Angier's machine.

275
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:46,039
You built this, Mr. Cutter?

276
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:48,980
Oh, no, sir. This wasn't built by a magician.

277
00:21:49,049 --> 00:21:51,079
This was built by a wizard.

278
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:56,150
A man who can actually do what magicians pretend to do.

279
00:21:56,230 --> 00:22:00,420
Tell me, Your Honor, what happens with these things after the trial?

280
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,460
They've been sold to a Lord Caldlow.

281
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:05,299
An avid collector, very interested in the case.

282
00:22:05,369 --> 00:22:07,859
Yeah. Well, don't let him take this.

283
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:10,740
- Why ever not?
- It's too dangerous.

284
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:12,970
I'm sure beneath its bells and whistles

285
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:15,339
it's got a simple and disappointing trick.

286
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:17,849
The most disappointing of all, sir.

287
00:22:20,019 --> 00:22:21,710
It has no trick.

288
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:25,750
It's real.

289
00:22:28,859 --> 00:22:31,160
This is the tank Angier drowned in?

290
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:33,289
Yes.

291
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:35,519
This is the...

292
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:38,660
...place where the performer's hand reaches through

293
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,000
to the trick padlock.

294
00:22:40,069 --> 00:22:42,329
A standard magical apparatus for escapes?

295
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:44,900
Yeah, with one important difference.

296
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:47,000
This isn't a trick lock.

297
00:22:47,079 --> 00:22:49,039
It's been switched for a real one.

298
00:22:49,109 --> 00:22:51,079
What a way to kill someone.

299
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:53,839
They're magicians, Your Honor.

300
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:59,319
Showmen, men who live by dressing up plain and sometimes brutal truths,

301
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,490
to amaze, to shock.

302
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:04,720
Even without an audience?

303
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,859
There was an audience.

304
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,759
You see, this water tank

305
00:23:10,829 --> 00:23:14,269
was of particular significance to these two men.

306
00:23:15,569 --> 00:23:18,099
Particularly awful significance.

307
00:23:21,009 --> 00:23:26,000
Which of you brave souls is willing to bind this lovely young woman?

308
00:23:28,579 --> 00:23:30,069
If you would tie her wrists,

309
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:32,309
bind her feet around the ankle.

310
00:23:45,539 --> 00:23:48,130
- Are either of you gentlemen sailors?
- No.

311
00:23:50,109 --> 00:23:52,299
I'm sure you can both tie a strong knot.

312
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,690
Robert!

313
00:25:10,849 --> 00:25:12,250
No, no.

314
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:18,750
Julia. Julia!

315
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,309
I knew an old sailor once.

316
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:09,279
They told me he went overboard,

317
00:26:09,349 --> 00:26:11,440
tangled in the sails.

318
00:26:11,509 --> 00:26:13,309
They pulled him out,

319
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:17,279
but it took him five minutes to cough.

320
00:26:17,349 --> 00:26:19,380
He said it was like...

321
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:21,289
...going home.

322
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:28,960
What do you want, Borden?

323
00:26:35,769 --> 00:26:37,799
I'm sorry for your loss, Angier.

324
00:26:41,609 --> 00:26:43,670
Which knot did you tie?

325
00:26:46,819 --> 00:26:49,750
I keep asking myself that.

326
00:26:49,819 --> 00:26:51,809
- And?
- And...

327
00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:56,420
I'm sorry, I just don't know.

328
00:26:58,490 --> 00:26:59,980
You don't know?

329
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:03,769
I'm sorry.

330
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:07,329
You don't know?

331
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:13,140
You don't know?!

332
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:22,750
- Alfred?
- Good news. We got our first booking.

333
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:25,150
I don't think we've had the pleasure.

334
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:28,250
- Mr. Fallon is my ingèŒ…nieur.
- Where did you get all...?

335
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:32,319
- I had to borrow and... don't ask.
- He's a very enterprising soul

336
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,190
is... is Mr. Fallon. So...

337
00:27:34,259 --> 00:27:37,700
- We can't afford to pay him.
- The money will come with the audience.

338
00:27:37,769 --> 00:27:41,460
But what about until then? What I earn, it's barely enough for us.

339
00:27:41,539 --> 00:27:45,500
Don't worry about it. I'll share half my food with him or something.

340
00:27:45,569 --> 00:27:48,539
You're going to be doing that with someone else.

341
00:27:48,609 --> 00:27:50,509
No. You're...

342
00:27:50,579 --> 00:27:52,839
Having a baby.

343
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,819
Oh, my God.

344
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:58,720
We should have told Fallon. That is great.

345
00:27:58,789 --> 00:28:01,259
Oh, come here.

346
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:04,289
Oh.

347
00:28:04,359 --> 00:28:05,880
Alfred, what is this?

348
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:10,130
Oh, this is just the trick to work Ackerman up at the end of my act.

349
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,900
Is it the masterpiece, the great trick?

350
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:15,730
No, no, no, the world is not ready for that one yet.

351
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:20,140
This is just your run-of-the-mill, daring, spectacular bullet catch.

352
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:22,730
- A bullet catch.
- Yeah, but it's safe.

353
00:28:22,809 --> 00:28:25,109
I promise. Look.

354
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,750
- Shoot me.
- Shoot you?

355
00:28:29,819 --> 00:28:31,049
Go on, shoot me.

356
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:35,579
- Right there.
- No, I can't.

357
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:38,220
No, no, not there. Shoot me here. Don't...

358
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:45,329
How's that?

359
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:48,730
That's very good. Tell me how you do it.

360
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:49,930
No, I can't do that.

361
00:28:52,009 --> 00:28:54,869
- Well, then you can't do it.
- I can't do it?

362
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:58,279
I'm sorry, but I can't raise a child on my own.

363
00:28:58,349 --> 00:29:00,680
You don't tell anybody that I told you.

364
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:03,079
- OK.
- Gunpowder.

365
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:06,779
Wadding.

366
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:10,519
Then the bullet.

367
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:12,859
Ramrod.

368
00:29:17,569 --> 00:29:19,559
Hold out your hand.

369
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:25,569
The bullet is not even in the gun when the charge is fired.

370
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:29,410
Once you know, it's actually very obvious.

371
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,470
Well, I mean, you still get...

372
00:29:32,549 --> 00:29:34,140
It's dangerous.

373
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:36,410
- People still get killed doing that.
- How?

374
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:39,220
You get some smartass who could put a penny or a button

375
00:29:39,289 --> 00:29:42,619
or, God forbid, Sarah, somebody could put a bullet down there.

376
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:45,890
Don't worry. Don't worry,

377
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:49,230
because I'm not gonna let anything happen.

378
00:29:49,299 --> 00:29:52,170
Everything's gonna be all right because...

379
00:29:53,539 --> 00:29:56,799
...I love you very much.

380
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,740
- Say it again.
- I love you.

381
00:30:03,809 --> 00:30:06,279
- Not today.
- What?

382
00:30:06,349 --> 00:30:09,509
Well, some days it's not true, and today you don't mean it.

383
00:30:09,589 --> 00:30:12,819
Maybe today you're more in love with magic than me.

384
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:15,519
I like being able to tell the difference.

385
00:30:15,589 --> 00:30:18,390
It makes the days it is true

386
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:20,789
mean something.

387
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:23,859
All right.

388
00:30:42,849 --> 00:30:46,150
Metal rings, ladies and gentlemen.

389
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:48,880
If there are any ladies and gentlemen here.

390
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,329
- Solid metal.
- Seen that already.

391
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:04,059
Who threw that?

392
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:22,450
This is what you came for, is it?

393
00:31:26,299 --> 00:31:27,789
So...

394
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,799
...who wants to volunteer?

395
00:31:30,869 --> 00:31:32,630
- I do!
- Me!

396
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:41,430
Me.

397
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:45,269
Me.

398
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:01,190
Are you man enough, sir?

399
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:08,000
Yes.

400
00:32:18,779 --> 00:32:20,839
Which knot did you tie, Borden?

401
00:32:27,059 --> 00:32:29,319
Which knot did you tie, Borden?

402
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:32,190
I don't know.

403
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:51,410
He came in to demand an answer, and I told him the truth.

404
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:54,640
That I have fought with myself over that night,

405
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,049
one half of me swearing blind that I tied a simple slipknot,

406
00:32:58,119 --> 00:33:01,490
the other half convinced that I tied the Langford double.

407
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:03,579
I can never know for sure.

408
00:33:06,529 --> 00:33:08,789
How can he not know!

409
00:33:08,859 --> 00:33:10,630
How can he not know?

410
00:33:12,269 --> 00:33:14,759
He must know what he did.

411
00:33:14,839 --> 00:33:16,240
He must.

412
00:33:18,869 --> 00:33:20,869
Sarah, that bloody hurts.

413
00:33:21,579 --> 00:33:24,210
I don't understand how it can be bleeding again.

414
00:33:24,279 --> 00:33:26,710
It's as bad as the day it happened.

415
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:32,390
- We have to get a doctor back.
- We can't afford the doctor back.

416
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:37,549
- You've woken her.
- Great.

417
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:40,529
I'm sorry, I need this to heal so I can get back to work.

418
00:33:40,599 --> 00:33:44,359
You've got to face things. What tricks can you perform with this injury?

419
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:47,890
I can do car pulls. I can do some prop tricks.

420
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:52,339
I can still do that. I can do the trick I've been telling you about.

421
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:54,539
The one that they're gonna remember me for.

422
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:58,500
Come on.

423
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:27,269
I never thought I'd find an answer at the bottom of a pint glass.

424
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,929
Hasn't stopped your looking.

425
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:37,019
Heard about a booking. Nice little theater.

426
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:39,920
- Young, up-and-coming magician.
- Who?

427
00:34:39,989 --> 00:34:42,719
- You.
- Me? Booking? Why?

428
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:44,880
I want to keep on working.

429
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,190
Who's going to hire the ingèŒ…nieur that killed Julia McCullough

430
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:50,389
in front of a sellout crowd at the Orpheum?

431
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:53,360
Someone who knows it wasn't your fault.

432
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,929
Someone who knows Alfred Borden and his repertoire of exotic knots.

433
00:34:57,010 --> 00:35:00,530
I hear he had a spot of bad luck catching a bullet south of the river.

434
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:03,409
That's a dangerous trick, that one.

435
00:35:08,619 --> 00:35:10,590
We'll have to whitewash the windows,

436
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:14,349
confound the more curious members of the public, but it will do.

437
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:19,820
- We should see about an assistant.
- I've made some arrangements.

438
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:22,489
You settled on a name?

439
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,059
Yes, I have.

440
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:27,000
The Great Danton.

441
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:29,590
It's a bit old-fashioned, isn't it?

442
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:33,239
No, it's sophisticated.

443
00:35:33,309 --> 00:35:36,070
The birdcage can't be our climax. Everybody knows it.

444
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:38,550
- Not like this.
- I don't want to kill doves.

445
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:40,480
Then stay off the stage.

446
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:42,239
You're a magician, not a wizard.

447
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:46,190
You got to get your hands dirty, if you're going to achieve the impossible.

448
00:35:47,659 --> 00:35:50,019
In here, Miss Wenscombe.

449
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:54,550
No point in meeting Mr. Angier if you don't fit. On the right.

450
00:35:57,730 --> 00:35:59,760
- What's so hard about this?
- Nothing.

451
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:02,360
You're going... down here.

452
00:36:08,179 --> 00:36:11,039
- And this will conceal, right?
- Oh, sure.

453
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:13,309
- Tighten up on there.
- Yep.

454
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,409
OK.

455
00:36:16,519 --> 00:36:17,579
This ties up here?

456
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:19,050
- Ties in the back.
- Good.

457
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:27,320
Breathe as little as possible.

458
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,460
Now, you see?

459
00:36:36,539 --> 00:36:37,940
- That's it.
- OK.

460
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:43,210
She's not experienced,

461
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,300
but she knows how to present herself.

462
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:49,980
A pretty assistant is the most effective form of misdirection.

463
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:53,420
Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, for my final trick,

464
00:36:53,489 --> 00:36:56,250
I will require the assistance of two volunteers.

465
00:36:56,329 --> 00:36:58,590
Mr. Merrit, if you would oblige me?

466
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,019
Yep.

467
00:37:03,829 --> 00:37:05,530
- Under?
- Under, yeah.

468
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:08,400
Come around his foot.

469
00:37:08,469 --> 00:37:09,900
- Careful.
- It's all right.

470
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:33,019
- Your volunteer, put their hand there.
- Yeah?

471
00:37:33,099 --> 00:37:34,929
And another one here.

472
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,519
If you'll place your hands on either side of the cage, please.

473
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:39,929
Thank you, Olivia.

474
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,769
You best not be intending to hurt this animal, Mr. Angier.

475
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:46,210
- Of course not.
- Ready? Right.

476
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:49,769
- One...
- Two...

477
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:51,769
Three.

478
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:57,579
That's bloody marvelous, Cutter.

479
00:37:58,590 --> 00:37:59,780
Very nice.

480
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,650
And the best part is...

481
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:09,460
I thought you said I had to get my hands dirty.

482
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:11,429
Someday, perhaps you will.

483
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,059
I just had to know that you can.

484
00:38:13,139 --> 00:38:15,070
Very nice. Very nice, indeed.

485
00:38:15,139 --> 00:38:18,800
I haven't had the chance to compliment you on your beautiful theater.

486
00:38:18,869 --> 00:38:21,239
It'll be a lot more beautiful when it's full.

487
00:38:21,309 --> 00:38:22,300
Don't worry.

488
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:24,610
You all say that. Why should I worry?

489
00:38:24,679 --> 00:38:27,550
If your tricks don't get them in, somebody else's will.

490
00:38:27,619 --> 00:38:31,710
Maybe somebody willing to do a bullet catch or a water escape?

491
00:38:31,789 --> 00:38:33,349
Cheap thrills, Mr. Merrit.

492
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:37,090
People hoping for an accident, likely to see one too.

493
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:39,150
What would that do for your business?

494
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:42,090
You got a week, John.

495
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:45,530
Thank you, Mr. Merrit.

496
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:54,869
Thank you.

497
00:38:56,679 --> 00:39:00,309
Uh... Sir, in the third row there.

498
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:03,079
Please stand up and show us your handkerchief.

499
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:06,880
This isn't mine.

500
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,409
Perhaps you'd return it to the lady in the aisle of the second row.

501
00:39:10,489 --> 00:39:12,789
I believe she has yours.

502
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:23,800
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm making so many mistakes. I'm so nervous.

503
00:39:23,869 --> 00:39:26,139
The audience doesn't seem to be responding.

504
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:28,440
They've seen a lot of tricks before,

505
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:31,000
but not this next one.

506
00:39:40,059 --> 00:39:41,820
Cloth over.

507
00:39:41,889 --> 00:39:43,650
Keep your fingers crossed.

508
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:45,989
I'll have the champagne ready.

509
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,769
- You've seen this one before?
- We've seen them all before.

510
00:40:03,849 --> 00:40:05,969
I'll make it a little harder then, shall I?

511
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:09,019
Two volunteers, please. A lady and a gentlemen.

512
00:40:09,079 --> 00:40:12,280
To hold this cage with me.

513
00:40:12,349 --> 00:40:14,320
I'll perform this feat in a manner

514
00:40:14,389 --> 00:40:18,920
never before seen by yourselves or any other audience anywhere in the world.

515
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:24,019
Madame, place one hand on the back of the cage,

516
00:40:24,099 --> 00:40:25,619
one hand on the front.

517
00:40:25,699 --> 00:40:28,070
Sir, one hand on the bottom of the cage

518
00:40:28,139 --> 00:40:29,659
one hand on the top.

519
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:45,909
- I should've spotted him.
- You had a lot of plates going.

520
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:48,139
- Don't suppose we can do this again.
- No.

521
00:40:48,219 --> 00:40:50,650
- So, what's the climax of our show?
- Show?

522
00:40:50,719 --> 00:40:53,849
- You don't have a show.
- We have a week's engagement.

523
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:57,519
To perform magic, not butcher birds and break my customers' fingers.

524
00:40:57,590 --> 00:41:00,289
Clear out, anything here in the morning gets burned.

525
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,800
- Mr. Merrit...
- It's done, John.

526
00:41:02,869 --> 00:41:05,659
I've hired a comedian. You know I hate comedians.

527
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,289
Well, there's plenty of good theaters.

528
00:41:10,369 --> 00:41:13,210
If we can come up with a new trick,

529
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,510
- change the name of the act.
- The name stays.

530
00:41:18,349 --> 00:41:23,480
Right, well, then the new trick's gonna have to be irresistible then.

531
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:25,579
I have a couple of methods to try out.

532
00:41:25,659 --> 00:41:28,889
And then we need a new angle on the presentation.

533
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,789
And if you need some inspiration,

534
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:34,019
there's a technical exposition at the Albert Hall this week.

535
00:41:34,099 --> 00:41:36,829
Engineers, scientists, you know?

536
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:40,199
That sort of thing captures the public's imagination.

537
00:41:57,250 --> 00:42:00,650
Mind if I join you? Tesla sends me down here during the storms.

538
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:03,949
Perfect excuse to come join the Great Danton for a drink.

539
00:42:04,929 --> 00:42:07,329
Two of them.

540
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:10,019
Beautiful, isn't it? God, I miss New York, though.

541
00:42:10,099 --> 00:42:12,530
- Why are you here?
- The lightning lives here.

542
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:14,230
And not much else.

543
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:15,829
Our work is secret.

544
00:42:16,469 --> 00:42:18,369
That a cipher?

545
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,599
A rotating transposition that shifts every day of the diary.

546
00:42:23,679 --> 00:42:27,670
Simple but time-consuming to translate, even with the five-letter keyword.

547
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:29,480
Which is?

548
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:31,539
We magicians have a circle of trust.

549
00:42:31,619 --> 00:42:35,719
You have a circle of trust with someone whose diary you stole?

550
00:42:35,789 --> 00:42:37,550
Maybe I bought it.

551
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:40,360
And you're hoping to find a great secret in there?

552
00:42:40,429 --> 00:42:42,730
I've already found it.

553
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,199
That's why I'm here.

554
00:42:50,409 --> 00:42:53,030
Tesla built one for another magician.

555
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:54,869
Why would you want the same thing?

556
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:56,940
Call it a professional rivalry.

557
00:42:57,010 --> 00:43:01,139
Mr. Tesla has built unusual machines for unusual people.

558
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:05,250
- But he would never talk about it.
- I understand discretion.

559
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,619
I just want the machine.

560
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,619
Finish your drink.

561
00:43:12,599 --> 00:43:15,289
I want to show you something. I think you'll have

562
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:17,590
a special appreciation for our work.

563
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:21,130
- I thought it was a secret.
- You're a magician.

564
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:22,929
Who's gonna believe you?

565
00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:26,300
Not long now.

566
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:28,840
Our equipment requires a great deal of current.

567
00:43:28,909 --> 00:43:30,639
Tesla electrified the whole town

568
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:33,769
in exchange for using the generators when we need them.

569
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:38,179
We do our tests when the townspeople are asleep.

570
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:40,949
Mr. Tesla doesn't want to scare anyone.

571
00:43:58,769 --> 00:44:00,800
Where are the wires?

572
00:44:02,179 --> 00:44:03,440
Exactly.

573
00:44:12,659 --> 00:44:15,349
Where's the generator?

574
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:16,860
You saw it last week.

575
00:44:16,929 --> 00:44:20,019
- That must be ten miles from here.
- Fifteen.

576
00:44:20,099 --> 00:44:24,190
And I have to ride all of them before I get to bed.

577
00:44:24,269 --> 00:44:26,960
I'll send word for you in a few days, Mr. Angier.

578
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:31,130
Magic. Real magic.

579
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:33,329
Now appearing, only here at London's Royal Albert Hall,

580
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:37,679
one of the miracles of our age.

581
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:42,340
A technological marvel. You've never seen anything like it in your lives.

582
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:45,150
Your eyes will not believe what they're witnessing.

583
00:44:45,219 --> 00:44:48,090
The miracle of Nikola Tesla, ladies and gentlemen.

584
00:44:48,159 --> 00:44:50,650
Free, clean power. Like to know the future?

585
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:53,789
The man who's speaking right now is going to change the world.

586
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:58,230
Come one, come all. Immediate seating, no waiting.

587
00:45:13,349 --> 00:45:14,579
Ladies and gentlemen,

588
00:45:16,690 --> 00:45:18,519
objections have been raised...

589
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:22,019
They should be raised. Does that look safe to you?

590
00:45:22,090 --> 00:45:24,650
Part of Thomas Edison's smear campaign

591
00:45:24,730 --> 00:45:30,429
against Mr. Tesla's superior alternating current.

592
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:33,329
We have asked Mr. Tesla to reconsider.

593
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,889
Which he will not!

594
00:45:35,969 --> 00:45:41,139
But I've been told he refuses to appear under any such restrictions.

595
00:45:41,210 --> 00:45:43,769
This thing's gonna blow.

596
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:47,550
Ladies and gentlemen, please.

597
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:27,380
Hey.

598
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:32,059
Hello, Jess.

599
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:38,329
Have you had a nice day with mommy? Huh?

600
00:46:39,269 --> 00:46:41,289
Sarah.

601
00:46:41,369 --> 00:46:44,269
- I love you.
- See, today it's true.

602
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:46,900
- Yeah.
- Hello.

603
00:46:48,809 --> 00:46:51,179
I saw happiness.

604
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:53,880
Happiness that should have been mine.

605
00:46:53,949 --> 00:46:55,969
But I was wrong.

606
00:46:56,050 --> 00:47:00,679
His notebook reveals that he never had the life that I envied.

607
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:03,380
The family life that he craves one minute,

608
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:07,760
he rails against the next, demanding freedom.

609
00:47:07,829 --> 00:47:10,820
His mind... his mind is a divided one.

610
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:12,329
His soul is restless.

611
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,530
His wife and child, tormented

612
00:47:14,599 --> 00:47:18,559
by his fickle and contradictory nature.

613
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:25,269
So, what do you think you'll call her?

614
00:47:25,349 --> 00:47:26,710
I don't know.

615
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:29,079
Everybody needs a name, so, what's hers?

616
00:47:29,989 --> 00:47:31,780
Maybe Sarah.

617
00:47:34,159 --> 00:47:36,559
That's a lovely name. That's a lovely name.

618
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:39,860
Well, you talk about what you want to do for the rest of the day.

619
00:47:39,929 --> 00:47:41,789
All right, go on, you talk with her.

620
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:48,500
Are they taking her away?

621
00:47:48,570 --> 00:47:50,469
To the workhouse?

622
00:47:53,309 --> 00:47:54,800
You keep talking.

623
00:47:57,510 --> 00:47:59,909
Tell Owens I've reconsidered. Take it.

624
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:01,780
Go on, take it.

625
00:48:05,349 --> 00:48:07,480
It's for the best.

626
00:48:12,289 --> 00:48:14,889
Let me see.

627
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:17,590
I'm gonna learn all the professor's secrets.

628
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:21,099
Only if I teach you how to read.

629
00:48:21,170 --> 00:48:23,539
They're just stupid tricks, right?

630
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:26,840
Haven't helped you get out of here, have they?

631
00:48:26,909 --> 00:48:30,239
Or can't you undo real locks, professor?

632
00:48:31,610 --> 00:48:34,280
Maybe I'm just biding my time.

633
00:48:34,349 --> 00:48:36,840
Maybe one day I'll...

634
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:39,550
...open my hand, get your attention,

635
00:48:39,619 --> 00:48:42,519
ask, "Are you watching closely?"

636
00:48:42,590 --> 00:48:44,679
Maybe a magic whirl or two.

637
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:49,130
And then I'll be gone.

638
00:48:52,739 --> 00:48:55,800
How'd you get so famous then?

639
00:48:56,710 --> 00:48:58,429
Magic.

640
00:49:00,909 --> 00:49:03,780
Oi! Borden, get back here!

641
00:49:03,849 --> 00:49:05,400
Thank you.

642
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:07,449
Shut up!

643
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:12,849
Where's the bloody key?!

644
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:21,929
February 8,1899.

645
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,119
Today, finally, a breakthrough.

646
00:49:24,199 --> 00:49:26,929
Tesla's agreed to see me.

647
00:49:34,679 --> 00:49:35,840
Perfectly safe.

648
00:49:57,369 --> 00:50:01,130
So this is the Great Danton.

649
00:50:01,199 --> 00:50:05,800
Mr. Alley has effused about your act to me on any number of occasions.

650
00:50:07,639 --> 00:50:09,199
Hold out other hand.

651
00:50:17,789 --> 00:50:21,590
- What's conducting the electricity?
- Our bodies, Mr. Angier.

652
00:50:21,659 --> 00:50:25,860
Quite capable of conducting and, indeed, producing energy.

653
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,460
Have you eaten, Mr. Angier?

654
00:50:31,369 --> 00:50:34,530
I need something impossible.

655
00:50:36,309 --> 00:50:41,070
You're familiar with the phrase, "Man's reach exceeds his grasp"?

656
00:50:41,139 --> 00:50:42,840
Is a lie.

657
00:50:42,909 --> 00:50:44,940
Man's grasp exceeds his nerve.

658
00:50:46,150 --> 00:50:49,019
Society only tolerates one change at a time.

659
00:50:50,489 --> 00:50:53,750
First time I tried to change the world,

660
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:55,590
I was hailed as a visionary.

661
00:50:56,090 --> 00:50:58,219
Second time...

662
00:50:58,289 --> 00:51:01,320
...I was asked politely to retire.

663
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:05,989
So here I am, enjoying my retirement.

664
00:51:06,070 --> 00:51:09,940
Nothing is impossible, Mr. Angier. What you want is simply expensive.

665
00:51:10,010 --> 00:51:12,239
If I were to build for you this machine,

666
00:51:12,309 --> 00:51:15,369
you would be presenting it merely as illusion?

667
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:18,780
Well, if people actually believed the things I did on stage,

668
00:51:18,849 --> 00:51:21,250
they wouldn't clap, they'd scream.

669
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:23,309
Think of sawing a woman in half.

670
00:51:23,389 --> 00:51:25,719
Have you considered the cost of this?

671
00:51:25,789 --> 00:51:27,719
Price is not an object.

672
00:51:27,789 --> 00:51:31,750
Perhaps not, but have you considered the cost?

673
00:51:32,730 --> 00:51:34,059
I'm not sure I follow.

674
00:51:35,130 --> 00:51:36,960
Go home, forget this thing.

675
00:51:37,030 --> 00:51:39,230
I can recognize an obsession.

676
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:43,329
- No good will come of it.
- Hasn't good come of your obsessions?

677
00:51:43,409 --> 00:51:46,639
At first, but I have followed them too long.

678
00:51:46,710 --> 00:51:48,639
I am their slave.

679
00:51:48,710 --> 00:51:51,800
And one day, they will choose to destroy me.

680
00:51:53,619 --> 00:51:58,050
If you understand an obsession, then you know you won't change my mind.

681
00:51:58,989 --> 00:51:59,980
So be it.

682
00:52:01,489 --> 00:52:02,820
Will you build it?

683
00:52:03,789 --> 00:52:07,349
I've already begun to build it, Mr. Angier.

684
00:52:07,429 --> 00:52:11,420
I hope you enjoy the mountain air. This will take some time.

685
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:38,050
Uh... I thought you'd gone.

686
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:41,659
I don't really have anywhere to go.

687
00:52:43,630 --> 00:52:45,530
You've been sleeping here?

688
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:50,329
Cutter said it'd be all right till we get another booking. What are you doing?

689
00:52:50,409 --> 00:52:52,639
Uh... research.

690
00:52:52,710 --> 00:52:54,139
Part of a magician's job

691
00:52:54,210 --> 00:52:57,079
is to... watch his competition, see what illusions...

692
00:52:57,150 --> 00:53:00,079
You're going to do something to that man, aren't you?

693
00:53:00,150 --> 00:53:02,010
Cutter's hoping you let things lie.

694
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:04,949
He says if Borden thinks things are even between you...

695
00:53:05,019 --> 00:53:06,849
Even?

696
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:09,480
My wife for a couple of his fingers?

697
00:53:09,559 --> 00:53:12,650
He has a family now and he's performing again.

698
00:53:12,730 --> 00:53:15,559
Borden is out there living his life just as he intended,

699
00:53:15,630 --> 00:53:18,329
as if nothing had happened and look at me.

700
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,889
I'm alone and no theater will touch me.

701
00:53:20,969 --> 00:53:22,559
Us.

702
00:53:22,639 --> 00:53:25,000
You're going to need a better disguise.

703
00:53:42,519 --> 00:53:44,719
I need a volunteer.

704
00:53:44,789 --> 00:53:46,260
What happened?

705
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:49,090
Did you hurt him?

706
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,300
What happened, Robert?

707
00:53:54,699 --> 00:53:58,659
You, sir. Just a rubber ball, yes?

708
00:53:58,739 --> 00:53:59,829
Thank you.

709
00:53:59,909 --> 00:54:02,500
Just a rubber ball? No.

710
00:54:02,579 --> 00:54:05,769
Not normal. Not a normal rubber ball.

711
00:54:05,849 --> 00:54:06,969
It's magic.

712
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:09,840
He had a new trick.

713
00:54:23,869 --> 00:54:25,420
Was it good?

714
00:54:28,909 --> 00:54:33,760
It was the greatest magic trick I've ever seen.

715
00:54:37,679 --> 00:54:38,909
Did they applaud when you saw it?

716
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:43,750
It was too good. It was too simple. The audience hardly had time to see it.

717
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:46,690
- He's a dreadful magician.
- A wonderful magician.

718
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:49,280
He's a dreadful showman. He doesn't dress it up,

719
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:51,190
- how to sell it.
- How does he do it?

720
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:53,280
- He uses a double.
- No, it's too simple.

721
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:54,849
This is a complex illusion.

722
00:54:54,929 --> 00:54:57,329
You say that because you don't know the method.

723
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:59,800
It's a double that comes out. It's the only way.

724
00:54:59,869 --> 00:55:03,769
I've seen him perform it three times. The prestige is the same man.

725
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:07,369
- No, it's not.
- The same man comes out of the cabinet.

726
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:09,710
It's the same man.

727
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:12,469
He wears padded gloves to hide his damaged fingers,

728
00:55:12,550 --> 00:55:15,139
but, if you look closely, you can tell.

729
00:55:16,849 --> 00:55:19,719
He doesn't know how to sell it to an audience, but I do.

730
00:55:19,789 --> 00:55:22,219
Yeah, we could use it as a climax to the show.

731
00:55:22,289 --> 00:55:24,690
Yes.

732
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:27,960
The man stole my life, I'm gonna steal his trick.

733
00:55:28,030 --> 00:55:30,190
We got to find someone who looks like you.

734
00:55:30,269 --> 00:55:33,789
- He doesn't use a double.
- I don't know how Borden does it.

735
00:55:33,869 --> 00:55:38,360
Either... You either wait for him to retire and buy the secret,

736
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:40,239
or you listen to how I would do it.

737
00:55:40,309 --> 00:55:42,829
And the only way that I know how to do it

738
00:55:42,909 --> 00:55:45,380
is to find you a bloody good double.

739
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:47,780
All right.

740
00:55:49,219 --> 00:55:51,710
Take a good look. Let's get out there and find me.

741
00:55:51,789 --> 00:55:53,909
Whoo!

742
00:55:53,989 --> 00:55:55,480
Look, look.

743
00:56:00,030 --> 00:56:01,550
What's that?

744
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:07,199
- It's for you.
- What's this for?

745
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:09,670
Come.

746
00:56:11,909 --> 00:56:14,570
You...

747
00:56:14,639 --> 00:56:18,670
- I asked you last week...
- You caught me in a wrong mood.

748
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:20,940
- But you won't ever...
- Sarah,

749
00:56:21,019 --> 00:56:24,179
I'm gonna have to change my mind, aren't I?

750
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:28,920
The act is taking off. Soon we'll be in a bigger theater, things will work out.

751
00:56:31,489 --> 00:56:35,289
I can't believe it. Thank you. Thank you. It's beautiful.

752
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:45,030
- Gerry?
- Darling, look at you.

753
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:48,079
Mr. Cutter, Mr. Angier, I'd like you to meet Gerald Root.

754
00:56:48,139 --> 00:56:50,300
Mm-hm.

755
00:56:53,150 --> 00:56:57,079
A pleasure. Pleasure to meet you fine gentlemen.

756
00:56:57,150 --> 00:57:00,880
Would you like for me to tell you a little joke? Come here.

757
00:57:03,929 --> 00:57:07,019
Yes. Are you laughing now?

758
00:57:10,469 --> 00:57:12,090
I have to take a piss.

759
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:16,599
- He's out of his mind.
- Of course, he's an out-of-work actor.

760
00:57:16,670 --> 00:57:18,570
He's perfect. He needs a little help.

761
00:57:18,639 --> 00:57:21,610
But when I get done with him, he could be your brother.

762
00:57:21,679 --> 00:57:24,269
I don't need him to be my brother, I need him to be me.

763
00:57:24,349 --> 00:57:26,039
Give me a month.

764
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:35,449
So you open the door...

765
00:57:35,519 --> 00:57:36,989
...and...

766
00:57:44,369 --> 00:57:46,130
Come on.

767
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:51,769
Couldn't you have found a softer one?

768
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:54,170
Well, it's not for sleeping on.

769
00:57:54,239 --> 00:57:56,300
So, if you come down through there...

770
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:02,010
- ...does Root go up through there?
- Yep.

771
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:04,139
It's going to be amazing.

772
00:58:04,219 --> 00:58:07,679
Well, it has to be. Borden's trick is getting noticed.

773
00:58:10,530 --> 00:58:12,889
The place was packed today.

774
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:16,289
You went and saw his show again.

775
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:18,800
Ready to meet yourself, Mr. Angier?

776
00:58:27,179 --> 00:58:29,510
All I have to do is keep myself stinking drunk,

777
00:58:29,579 --> 00:58:31,909
and no one will be able to tell the difference.

778
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:34,070
Have a little faith, sir.

779
00:58:34,150 --> 00:58:38,050
Now, would you favor us with a performance, Mr. Root?

780
00:58:57,909 --> 00:59:02,969
You'd drink, too, if you knew the world half as well as I do.

781
00:59:06,679 --> 00:59:08,380
Did you think you were unique?

782
00:59:08,449 --> 00:59:11,150
I've been Caesar, I've played Faust.

783
00:59:11,219 --> 00:59:14,309
How difficult could it possibly be to play the Great Danton?

784
00:59:14,389 --> 00:59:17,519
You can go back to being yourself now, Root, for nothing.

785
00:59:17,590 --> 00:59:19,860
I'd rather be him for now.

786
00:59:19,929 --> 00:59:22,690
I find it, uh... amusing.

787
00:59:26,130 --> 00:59:27,860
"My liege,

788
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:31,269
I did deny no prisoners."

789
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:33,500
- You look wonderful.
- Oh, thank you.

790
00:59:33,579 --> 00:59:36,840
Root has to keep a low profile. Anyone sees him, the game's up.

791
00:59:36,909 --> 00:59:39,710
I don't know how you do things. I'm not sure I wanna know.

792
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:42,110
Have you thought what we should call it?

793
00:59:42,179 --> 00:59:46,349
There's no point being coy. Borden calls his trick The Transported Man.

794
00:59:50,260 --> 00:59:53,420
Ladies and gentlemen, much of what you've seen may be termed

795
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:57,260
as illusions or entertaining trifles.

796
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:02,989
Alas...

797
01:00:05,170 --> 01:00:07,699
...I cannot claim this next feat as illusion.

798
01:00:08,610 --> 01:00:09,800
Watch carefully.

799
01:00:11,250 --> 01:00:13,679
You will see no trickery,

800
01:00:13,750 --> 01:00:16,840
for no trickery is employed.

801
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:20,289
Merely a technique familiar to certain citizens of the Orient

802
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:22,519
and various holy men of the Himalayas.

803
01:00:25,789 --> 01:00:28,820
Indeed, many of you may be familiar with this technique,

804
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:32,059
but for those of you who are not, do not be alarmed.

805
01:00:32,130 --> 01:00:35,190
What you're about to see is considered safe.

806
01:01:06,769 --> 01:01:09,829
To our achievement.

807
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:12,670
The manager says he's never seen a reaction like it.

808
01:01:12,739 --> 01:01:16,039
At least he saw it. I spent the ovation hiding under the stage.

809
01:01:16,110 --> 01:01:18,440
No one cares about the man who disappears.

810
01:01:18,510 --> 01:01:20,500
They care about the one who comes out.

811
01:01:20,579 --> 01:01:22,639
I care about the man in the box.

812
01:01:22,719 --> 01:01:27,019
Thank you. I don't know, maybe we could switch before the trick.

813
01:01:27,090 --> 01:01:29,250
I'm the prestige, and Root's below stage.

814
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:32,260
No, the anticipation of the trick is everything.

815
01:01:32,329 --> 01:01:35,389
We need your showmanship to build up the suspense.

816
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:39,019
Once Root opens his mouth, it's over. He can't introduce this trick.

817
01:01:39,099 --> 01:01:41,829
Of course I can. I'm the Great Danton.

818
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:45,500
Root, you bloody fool, get out of that wardrobe and makeup.

819
01:01:45,570 --> 01:01:48,239
Anyone could walk in here at any minute.

820
01:01:48,309 --> 01:01:50,369
Congratulations, all.

821
01:01:50,449 --> 01:01:54,139
Life is not full of these moments. We worked hard.

822
01:01:54,219 --> 01:01:55,880
We need to celebrate properly.

823
01:01:59,619 --> 01:02:02,090
What's wrong? Is it your wife?

824
01:02:02,159 --> 01:02:04,460
No, it's the trick. It isn't good enough.

825
01:02:04,530 --> 01:02:07,860
Borden's trick is nothing compared to ours. He has no style.

826
01:02:07,929 --> 01:02:11,800
He doesn't spend the finale hiding under the stage.

827
01:02:11,869 --> 01:02:14,769
- I need to know how he does it.
- Why?

828
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:17,329
So I can do it better.

829
01:02:19,409 --> 01:02:21,880
I need you to go and work for him.

830
01:02:24,909 --> 01:02:26,639
Work for him? Are you joking?

831
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:29,110
You'll be my spy.

832
01:02:29,179 --> 01:02:31,380
We just got our start. You want me to leave?

833
01:02:31,449 --> 01:02:33,550
That's how we advance. Think of it.

834
01:02:33,619 --> 01:02:36,820
People are excited by Cutter's version. Imagine what we'd do

835
01:02:36,889 --> 01:02:41,329
with the real illusion. We'd have the greatest magic act anyone's ever seen.

836
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:45,159
- He knows I work for you.
- Exactly why he'll want to hire you.

837
01:02:45,230 --> 01:02:47,789
- He'll want my secret.
- Why would he trust me?

838
01:02:47,869 --> 01:02:50,570
Because you're gonna tell him the truth.

839
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:55,309
Hmm?

840
01:03:02,849 --> 01:03:03,980
Good girl.

841
01:03:07,159 --> 01:03:10,679
You must be curious to see what so much money has bought you.

842
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:14,260
Fitting you should be here for her maiden voyage.

843
01:03:14,329 --> 01:03:16,159
Your hat.

844
01:03:24,110 --> 01:03:26,699
You might want to stand back.

845
01:03:47,159 --> 01:03:48,289
I don't understand.

846
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:50,699
Perhaps it would be best if you left us to it.

847
01:03:50,769 --> 01:03:52,389
Is there a problem, Mr. Tesla?

848
01:03:52,469 --> 01:03:54,489
- No. Come back next week.
- Next week?

849
01:03:54,570 --> 01:03:57,130
- Next week, it will be fine.
- Tesla!

850
01:03:57,210 --> 01:03:58,929
Just a little temperamental.

851
01:04:04,780 --> 01:04:07,679
- Interesting workshop.
- Yeah, we make do.

852
01:04:07,750 --> 01:04:09,909
- My name is Olivia...
- I know who you are.

853
01:04:09,980 --> 01:04:11,650
Here to steal the rest of my show?

854
01:04:11,719 --> 01:04:13,619
To give your show what it's missing.

855
01:04:13,690 --> 01:04:16,920
- Yeah, what might that be?
- Me.

856
01:04:16,989 --> 01:04:21,449
I was just saying that, wasn't I?

857
01:04:21,530 --> 01:04:23,829
- A woman's touch.
- I've left Angier.

858
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:25,960
- All right.
- I want a job.

859
01:04:26,030 --> 01:04:27,369
Yeah.

860
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:29,269
I know you've no reason to trust me.

861
01:04:29,340 --> 01:04:30,900
Why wouldn't I trust you?

862
01:04:30,969 --> 01:04:34,409
You're only the mistress of my enemy. Why wouldn't I trust you?

863
01:04:36,079 --> 01:04:38,010
- Mr. Borden.
- Alfred.

864
01:04:40,449 --> 01:04:42,110
I'm going to tell you the truth.

865
01:04:42,179 --> 01:04:44,409
Now that is a slippery notion

866
01:04:44,489 --> 01:04:46,820
in our line of work, isn't it, Miss Wenscombe?

867
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:51,590
I am here because he sent me here.

868
01:04:51,659 --> 01:04:54,130
He wants me to work for you and steal your secret.

869
01:04:54,199 --> 01:04:57,559
What does he need my secret for? His trick is topnotch.

870
01:04:57,630 --> 01:05:00,230
He vanishes, and then he reappears instantly

871
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:02,789
on the other side of the stage, mute, overweight

872
01:05:02,869 --> 01:05:05,429
and, unless I'm mistaken, very drunk.

873
01:05:05,510 --> 01:05:09,000
It's astonishing. How does he do it? And tell me, Olivia,

874
01:05:09,079 --> 01:05:12,539
does he enjoy taking his bows under the stage?

875
01:05:12,610 --> 01:05:15,909
It's killing him. He's obsessed with discovering your methods.

876
01:05:15,980 --> 01:05:19,039
He thinks of nothing else, takes no pleasure in our success.

877
01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:20,610
And I've had enough.

878
01:05:20,690 --> 01:05:23,090
There is no future with him.

879
01:05:24,230 --> 01:05:27,960
He sent me here to steal your secrets, but I've come to offer you his.

880
01:05:28,030 --> 01:05:31,929
This is the truth... is it?

881
01:05:36,469 --> 01:05:38,769
Think you'd better get dressed, sir.

882
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:42,869
Root, you're late and more drunk than usual. Get down below stairs right away.

883
01:05:42,940 --> 01:05:44,670
No.

884
01:05:44,750 --> 01:05:48,110
No, we need to have a little chat, Mr. Cutter.

885
01:05:48,179 --> 01:05:52,519
We have a problem. Cutter, Borden is performing right across the street.

886
01:05:52,590 --> 01:05:55,849
Yeah, we have a bigger problem.

887
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:58,920
Root. He's realized that he can make demands.

888
01:05:58,989 --> 01:06:01,090
Wha...? He's blackmailing us?

889
01:06:01,159 --> 01:06:03,130
I was surprised, to tell you the truth.

890
01:06:03,199 --> 01:06:05,789
It usually takes them a lot longer to figure it out.

891
01:06:05,869 --> 01:06:08,429
- How much does he want?
- It makes no difference.

892
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:11,960
- We've got to stop doing the trick.
- Stop the trick? Look at this.

893
01:06:12,039 --> 01:06:17,880
Last week they said you were the premier stage performer in London.

894
01:06:17,949 --> 01:06:21,309
Not magician, mind you. Performer of any kind.

895
01:06:21,380 --> 01:06:24,610
- What's your point?
- My point is, you've climbed too high

896
01:06:24,690 --> 01:06:27,119
to get away with professional embarrassment.

897
01:06:27,190 --> 01:06:30,559
We don't do any tricks we can't control.

898
01:06:32,730 --> 01:06:36,030
Just pay him for now. We keep doing the trick until Borden opens,

899
01:06:36,099 --> 01:06:38,070
and then we'll phase it out.

900
01:06:38,969 --> 01:06:40,460
All right.

901
01:06:43,239 --> 01:06:45,360
Cutter was always surprised

902
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:47,340
how fast Root turned bad.

903
01:06:47,409 --> 01:06:51,969
To what do I owe the pleasure of this rather welcome pint of ale?

904
01:06:52,050 --> 01:06:55,170
- You're the Great Danton, aren't you?
- Sh, sh, sh, sh, sh.

905
01:06:55,250 --> 01:06:58,909
Of course I am, but don't advertise it, because I'll be mobbed with fans.

906
01:06:58,989 --> 01:07:01,420
We paid him enough to keep him in beers.

907
01:07:01,489 --> 01:07:03,579
You wouldn't expect him to rock the boat.

908
01:07:03,659 --> 01:07:06,250
Many of you may be familiar with this technique,

909
01:07:06,329 --> 01:07:09,820
but for those of you who aren't, do not be alarmed.

910
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:13,059
What you're about to see is considered safe.

911
01:07:13,130 --> 01:07:16,760
- And who are you?
- I am a humble admirer

912
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:19,429
and a fellow practitioner.

913
01:07:19,510 --> 01:07:21,869
Mmm. Very good.

914
01:07:31,250 --> 01:07:34,090
- Another one?
- Oh, if you insist.

915
01:07:34,159 --> 01:07:36,889
- Another.
- I'm not performing tonight.

916
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:38,980
I'm only doing one show, but to be frank,

917
01:07:39,059 --> 01:07:41,389
my people pretty much run things these days.

918
01:07:41,460 --> 01:07:42,659
Get up there.

919
01:07:44,030 --> 01:07:45,090
Get up!

920
01:07:45,170 --> 01:07:47,929
Your illusion, The Transported Man,

921
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,599
I'm not claiming to know your methods,

922
01:07:50,670 --> 01:07:54,869
but I had a similar trick in my act,

923
01:07:54,940 --> 01:07:57,780
and, uh...I used a double.

924
01:07:57,849 --> 01:08:03,039
- Mm, I see, very good.
- Well, it was, and then it went bad.

925
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:06,519
What I didn't count on was that when I incorporated this bloke

926
01:08:06,590 --> 01:08:08,679
into my act,

927
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:10,750
he had complete power over me.

928
01:08:11,889 --> 01:08:13,519
Complete power, you say?

929
01:08:29,510 --> 01:08:30,939
Ohh!

930
01:08:31,010 --> 01:08:36,279
Be very careful giving someone that power over you.

931
01:08:36,350 --> 01:08:40,680
Huh. Thank you. Um...

932
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:43,619
Yes, thank you for the warning.

933
01:08:43,689 --> 01:08:46,390
Hmm. Cheers.

934
01:08:47,829 --> 01:08:49,960
I cannot claim this next feat as illusion.

935
01:08:50,029 --> 01:08:53,399
What you're about to see is considered safe.

936
01:08:57,710 --> 01:08:59,399
Ahh!

937
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:36,600
Oh! The Great Danton.

938
01:09:42,819 --> 01:09:44,680
I apologize.

939
01:09:44,750 --> 01:09:48,520
There simply is too much magic...

940
01:09:48,590 --> 01:09:51,350
...for my stage at The Pantages

941
01:09:51,430 --> 01:09:53,590
across the street.

942
01:09:57,630 --> 01:10:00,569
Pardon my intrusion.

943
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:07,039
And go easy on the poor chap. He does try so very hard.

944
01:10:09,909 --> 01:10:12,350
I don't know how Borden found him.

945
01:10:12,409 --> 01:10:14,310
Kept him under wraps. I was careful.

946
01:10:14,380 --> 01:10:16,039
Yeah, well, he did.

947
01:10:17,220 --> 01:10:19,210
Do you think it was her?

948
01:10:25,460 --> 01:10:28,430
You weren't expecting me?

949
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:31,229
I expected you sooner. Your message said afternoon.

950
01:10:31,300 --> 01:10:33,560
It takes a bit for me to get around these days.

951
01:10:33,630 --> 01:10:37,699
He's taken everything from me. My wife, my career,

952
01:10:37,770 --> 01:10:39,640
- now you.
- You sent me.

953
01:10:39,710 --> 01:10:42,770
I sent you to steal his secret, not to improve his act.

954
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:44,399
- It's my job.
- Or fall in love!

955
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:47,239
- I did everything you asked!
- Yes? Yes?

956
01:10:47,319 --> 01:10:48,909
- How does he do it?
- Cutter was right, a double.

957
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:52,109
-'Course he said that.
- He didn't say it.

958
01:10:52,189 --> 01:10:55,619
I've seen things, makeup, glasses, wigs. We don't use for the show.

959
01:10:55,689 --> 01:10:58,420
- I've seen it hidden backstage.
- Misdirection.

960
01:10:58,489 --> 01:11:01,189
He leaves them lying around to make you think that.

961
01:11:01,260 --> 01:11:03,130
He doesn't know when I'm looking.

962
01:11:03,199 --> 01:11:06,430
All the time, Olivia! That's who he is!

963
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:07,760
That's what it takes!

964
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:10,270
He lives his act, don't you see?

965
01:11:12,310 --> 01:11:15,670
Just because you're sleeping with him doesn't mean he trusts you.

966
01:11:15,739 --> 01:11:18,140
You think you can see everything, don't you?

967
01:11:18,210 --> 01:11:21,050
The Great Danton is a blind fool.

968
01:11:21,119 --> 01:11:22,510
His notebook.

969
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:26,149
You stole it?

970
01:11:26,220 --> 01:11:28,020
I borrowed it for tonight.

971
01:11:28,090 --> 01:11:30,279
I thought you could translate some of it...

972
01:11:30,359 --> 01:11:34,420
I can't. No one can. It's a cipher.

973
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:37,930
Even with the keyword, it will take months to decode.

974
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,899
- And without the keyword?
- Perhaps never.

975
01:11:40,970 --> 01:11:42,600
- We'll see.
- We will not see.

976
01:11:42,670 --> 01:11:45,609
If I don't get that back by tomorrow he'll know I took it.

977
01:11:45,670 --> 01:11:47,970
- Leave him.
- I can't. He knows where I live.

978
01:11:49,310 --> 01:11:54,109
This is his diary, Olivia. All of his secrets are right here in my hands.

979
01:11:54,779 --> 01:11:56,369
It won't bring your wife back.

980
01:11:56,449 --> 01:11:59,149
I don't care about my wife. I care about his secret.

981
01:12:12,399 --> 01:12:15,130
Look, I'll, um...

982
01:12:15,199 --> 01:12:17,529
I'll go to his workshop and stage a break-in.

983
01:12:17,609 --> 01:12:20,800
- He'll know you took it.
- Yes, me. Not you.

984
01:12:21,909 --> 01:12:23,899
Understand?

985
01:12:32,350 --> 01:12:33,340
Robert.

986
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:38,550
I have fallen in love with him.

987
01:12:39,460 --> 01:12:41,930
Then I know how hard this has been for you.

988
01:12:50,470 --> 01:12:51,960
Notebook?

989
01:12:54,609 --> 01:12:56,600
Then he's just getting started.

990
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:27,310
Professor!

991
01:13:27,369 --> 01:13:28,859
Good evening.

992
01:13:33,750 --> 01:13:35,369
I'm walking tonight.

993
01:13:35,449 --> 01:13:38,010
Let him come. I don't care.

994
01:13:38,090 --> 01:13:40,779
Professor! Professor!

995
01:15:03,170 --> 01:15:04,600
Ahh!

996
01:15:04,670 --> 01:15:07,229
- You all right?
- I'm alive.

997
01:15:07,310 --> 01:15:09,399
Saves me cutting you an air hole.

998
01:15:23,489 --> 01:15:26,050
- I'm impressed.
- Why is that?

999
01:15:26,130 --> 01:15:29,100
You're finally getting your hands dirty.

1000
01:15:29,159 --> 01:15:32,060
It's what a good trick costs, Angier.

1001
01:15:32,130 --> 01:15:34,930
Risk, sacrifice.

1002
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,489
The sacrifice, I'm afraid, is all gonna be yours,

1003
01:15:37,569 --> 01:15:39,199
unless you give me what I want.

1004
01:15:40,569 --> 01:15:42,699
- Which is?
- Your secret.

1005
01:15:42,779 --> 01:15:44,180
My secret?

1006
01:15:44,250 --> 01:15:47,369
Your method for The Transported Man.

1007
01:15:47,449 --> 01:15:50,279
Fallon wouldn't tell me. He doesn't talk at all.

1008
01:15:50,350 --> 01:15:53,840
- You have my notebook.
- Useless without the keyword.

1009
01:15:55,319 --> 01:15:58,880
Write down your method, Mr. Borden, describe it in full.

1010
01:16:12,010 --> 01:16:14,369
I want the whole method, not the keyword.

1011
01:16:14,439 --> 01:16:16,840
I don't know if your secret's in your notebook.

1012
01:16:16,909 --> 01:16:19,380
The keyword is the method.

1013
01:16:23,380 --> 01:16:24,680
Where's my ingèŒ…nieur?

1014
01:16:31,829 --> 01:16:34,449
- Alive?
- How fast can you dig?

1015
01:16:36,930 --> 01:16:39,960
Fallon, you hear me? Fallon!

1016
01:16:41,270 --> 01:16:43,930
- How's the arm?
- Still attached.

1017
01:16:45,369 --> 01:16:46,930
Did you find your answer?

1018
01:16:47,010 --> 01:16:50,770
Our answer, Cutter. I haven't looked yet. I wanted you to share this.

1019
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:53,279
I already know how he does it, Robert.

1020
01:16:53,350 --> 01:16:56,439
Same way he always has, the same way as we do.

1021
01:16:56,520 --> 01:16:58,989
It's just that you want something more.

1022
01:16:59,050 --> 01:17:01,819
Well, let's find out then, shall we?

1023
01:17:06,130 --> 01:17:07,560
What does it mean?

1024
01:17:15,399 --> 01:17:17,869
It means, Cutter, we have a journey ahead of us.

1025
01:17:17,939 --> 01:17:19,909
- To America.
- Robert?

1026
01:17:20,869 --> 01:17:23,840
Listen to me.

1027
01:17:23,909 --> 01:17:27,369
Obsession is a young man's game.

1028
01:17:27,449 --> 01:17:28,970
Come on.

1029
01:17:29,050 --> 01:17:31,520
I can't follow you any further in it.

1030
01:17:32,590 --> 01:17:34,520
I can't, I'm sorry.

1031
01:17:38,630 --> 01:17:40,319
Then the rest is up to me.

1032
01:17:42,399 --> 01:17:43,920
I'm sorry.

1033
01:17:49,239 --> 01:17:52,829
Good evening. Hello, darling.

1034
01:17:52,909 --> 01:17:54,399
Champagne, your finest.

1035
01:17:54,479 --> 01:17:57,170
I didn't know we were going to be joined for dinner.

1036
01:17:57,239 --> 01:17:59,539
Absolutely, we are celebrating.

1037
01:17:59,609 --> 01:18:01,310
Miss Wenscombe, Mr. Fallon.

1038
01:18:02,319 --> 01:18:05,180
- What are we celebrating?
- We've hit upon a new trick.

1039
01:18:05,250 --> 01:18:07,310
- Haven't we?
- What trick, Freddie?

1040
01:18:07,390 --> 01:18:09,409
Yes, Freddie, what trick?

1041
01:18:09,489 --> 01:18:13,890
I am going to bury myself alive every night,

1042
01:18:13,960 --> 01:18:17,829
and then someone will come along and dig me up. Wonderful.

1043
01:18:17,899 --> 01:18:20,989
- I think he's had quite enough...
- No, pour the champagne.

1044
01:18:21,069 --> 01:18:24,770
Pour the... Sarah, don't talk to me like that. I'm not a bloody child.

1045
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:28,039
- Perhaps it would be better...
- Mr. Fallon, escort her home.

1046
01:18:28,109 --> 01:18:30,939
- My husband's being a bore.
- Oh, please.

1047
01:18:31,010 --> 01:18:34,810
- I see no reason you should suffer.
- Don't ruin this evening.

1048
01:18:37,220 --> 01:18:40,119
Good night, Mrs. Borden. Good night, Freddie.

1049
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:46,859
- Freddie?
- That's my name.

1050
01:18:46,930 --> 01:18:50,289
- Not at home.
- I'm not always at home, am I?

1051
01:18:52,100 --> 01:18:54,760
Couldn't you have at least taken off the beard?

1052
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:59,000
Sarah, I just came from the bloody theater just now.

1053
01:18:59,069 --> 01:19:02,130
All right? I'm out in public. Everybody else loves it.

1054
01:19:02,210 --> 01:19:04,140
Why are you being like this?

1055
01:19:04,210 --> 01:19:07,109
I had a terrible ordeal today.

1056
01:19:07,180 --> 01:19:10,949
I thought that something very precious...

1057
01:19:12,119 --> 01:19:14,050
...had been lost to me.

1058
01:19:14,119 --> 01:19:17,250
So I just wanted to celebrate just a little.

1059
01:19:17,319 --> 01:19:20,779
All right, what? What did you lose?

1060
01:19:25,930 --> 01:19:27,489
I see, more secrets.

1061
01:19:28,439 --> 01:19:31,600
Sarah, secrets are my life.

1062
01:19:33,539 --> 01:19:35,909
- Our life.
- No, Alfred, stop, this isn't you.

1063
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:39,350
Stop performing.

1064
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:06,000
I thought I had the place to myself.

1065
01:20:06,069 --> 01:20:09,369
Unexpected guests, not very polite.

1066
01:20:09,439 --> 01:20:11,270
A lot of questions.

1067
01:20:11,350 --> 01:20:14,140
At first, I thought they worked for the government.

1068
01:20:14,210 --> 01:20:17,880
- No?
- Worse, they work for Thomas Edison.

1069
01:20:19,850 --> 01:20:22,340
Today, a most curious development.

1070
01:20:22,420 --> 01:20:25,479
His assistant came to us with a proposition.

1071
01:20:27,130 --> 01:20:30,529
Obviously, Angier has sent her and told her to admit as much.

1072
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:33,399
Does he enjoy taking his bows under the stage?

1073
01:20:33,470 --> 01:20:37,229
He sent me here to steal your secrets, but I've come to offer you his.

1074
01:20:37,300 --> 01:20:40,270
This is the truth...

1075
01:20:40,340 --> 01:20:41,329
...is it?

1076
01:20:49,380 --> 01:20:52,840
No, that's what he told me to tell you. The truth...

1077
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:56,750
...is that I loved him and I stood by him and he sent me to you,

1078
01:20:56,819 --> 01:21:00,350
like he would send a stagehand to pick up his shirts.

1079
01:21:00,430 --> 01:21:03,229
I hate him for that.

1080
01:21:03,300 --> 01:21:06,529
I could spot Angier's methods from the back of the theater.

1081
01:21:08,239 --> 01:21:10,500
So, what could you possibly have to offer me?

1082
01:21:10,569 --> 01:21:12,199
You may know his tricks,

1083
01:21:12,270 --> 01:21:15,329
but you can't understand why no one sees yours are better.

1084
01:21:15,409 --> 01:21:17,970
You hide this. I had to look very closely

1085
01:21:18,050 --> 01:21:20,380
to spot it during The Transported Man,

1086
01:21:20,449 --> 01:21:23,279
but this makes you unique.

1087
01:21:23,350 --> 01:21:25,380
It shows you aren't using a double.

1088
01:21:25,449 --> 01:21:27,939
You mustn't hide it. You must display it proudly.

1089
01:21:28,020 --> 01:21:32,789
I'm sure it takes great skill to perform illusions with one good hand.

1090
01:21:32,859 --> 01:21:34,619
Yeah, it does.

1091
01:21:36,399 --> 01:21:39,560
So let people know.

1092
01:21:39,630 --> 01:21:43,130
You can be so much more than he is and I can show you how.

1093
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:47,430
I think she's telling the truth.

1094
01:21:47,510 --> 01:21:49,630
I think we cannot trust her.

1095
01:21:53,180 --> 01:21:55,649
But I love her. I need her.

1096
01:21:56,850 --> 01:22:00,180
To open myself to such a relationship,

1097
01:22:00,250 --> 01:22:04,090
to the dangers of such an affair,

1098
01:22:04,159 --> 01:22:08,960
I need assurances of fidelity, of love.

1099
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:11,590
But how to be sure?

1100
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:18,130
I know a way. It's the only way to know her mind.

1101
01:22:18,210 --> 01:22:20,039
How could he send you away?

1102
01:22:21,909 --> 01:22:25,000
She must help me rid ourselves of Angier.

1103
01:22:31,619 --> 01:22:34,609
Today, my mistress proves her truthfulness.

1104
01:22:34,689 --> 01:22:36,420
Not to me, you understand.

1105
01:22:36,489 --> 01:22:39,119
I've been convinced since she led me to Root.

1106
01:22:39,189 --> 01:22:42,720
Today, Olivia proves her love for me

1107
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:45,260
to you, Angier.

1108
01:22:45,329 --> 01:22:49,739
Yes, Angier, she gave you this notebook at my request.

1109
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:53,239
And yes, "Tesla" is merely the key to my dairy,

1110
01:22:53,310 --> 01:22:56,100
not to my trick. You really think I'd part

1111
01:22:56,180 --> 01:22:59,300
with my secret so easily after so much?

1112
01:22:59,380 --> 01:23:01,039
Goodbye, Angier.

1113
01:23:01,109 --> 01:23:03,479
May you find solace for your forward ambition

1114
01:23:03,550 --> 01:23:05,350
back in your American home.

1115
01:23:14,859 --> 01:23:16,489
Tesla!

1116
01:23:18,430 --> 01:23:20,829
Tesla! Alley!

1117
01:23:22,039 --> 01:23:23,020
Alley!

1118
01:23:23,100 --> 01:23:25,699
Tesla never made a machine like the one I asked for.

1119
01:23:25,770 --> 01:23:28,569
- I never said he had.
- You let me believe that he had.

1120
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:31,340
You stole my money because your funding was cut off.

1121
01:23:31,409 --> 01:23:34,310
You've been shooting sparks in my top hat,

1122
01:23:34,380 --> 01:23:37,869
Iaughing at me all along, while using my money to stave off ruin.

1123
01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:40,850
- I have seen Edison's men.
- Where?

1124
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:43,409
In the hotel, I have a mind to bring them up here.

1125
01:23:43,489 --> 01:23:46,189
That would be unwise, Mr. Angier.

1126
01:23:46,260 --> 01:23:49,390
It is true that you are our last remaining financier,

1127
01:23:49,460 --> 01:23:51,329
but we have not stolen your money.

1128
01:23:51,399 --> 01:23:52,869
This is my cat.

1129
01:23:52,930 --> 01:23:55,989
When I told you I could make you a machine, I spoke a truth.

1130
01:23:56,069 --> 01:23:57,159
Why isn't it working?

1131
01:23:57,239 --> 01:23:59,569
Because exact science, Mr. Angier,

1132
01:23:59,640 --> 01:24:01,039
is not an exact science.

1133
01:24:01,109 --> 01:24:04,270
The machine simply does not operate as expected.

1134
01:24:04,340 --> 01:24:08,369
- It requires further examination.
- So where did my top hat go?

1135
01:24:08,449 --> 01:24:09,510
Nowhere.

1136
01:24:09,579 --> 01:24:12,380
We tried the damn thing a dozen times.

1137
01:24:12,449 --> 01:24:14,079
The hat went nowhere.

1138
01:24:14,149 --> 01:24:16,050
We need to try different material.

1139
01:24:16,119 --> 01:24:18,279
It may provoke a different result.

1140
01:24:20,930 --> 01:24:22,489
Great.

1141
01:24:29,640 --> 01:24:33,600
You are responsible for whatever happens to this animal, doctor.

1142
01:24:55,130 --> 01:24:57,760
I hope whatever you were really doing with my money

1143
01:24:57,829 --> 01:25:00,270
was more worthwhile, Mr. Tesla.

1144
01:25:56,189 --> 01:25:57,180
Alley!

1145
01:26:00,260 --> 01:26:01,989
So the machine was working?

1146
01:26:02,060 --> 01:26:05,689
I never checked the calibration, 'cause the hat never moved.

1147
01:26:05,770 --> 01:26:08,630
These things never quite work as you expect them to.

1148
01:26:08,699 --> 01:26:11,189
That's one of the principal beauties of science.

1149
01:26:11,270 --> 01:26:14,729
I'll need a couple of weeks to iron out the problems with the machine.

1150
01:26:14,909 --> 01:26:16,869
We'll send word when it's ready.

1151
01:26:19,079 --> 01:26:22,050
Don't forget your hat.

1152
01:26:22,119 --> 01:26:25,850
- Well, which one is mine?
- They are all your hats.

1153
01:26:31,789 --> 01:26:34,779
You look so pretty in this new dress of yours.

1154
01:26:34,859 --> 01:26:38,699
- Are we going to the zoo?
- No, Daddy has some errands to run.

1155
01:26:38,770 --> 01:26:41,000
- But you promised.
- I promised, did I?

1156
01:26:41,069 --> 01:26:43,369
Then go to the zoo, we shall.

1157
01:26:43,439 --> 01:26:46,890
Daddy will go run his errands, and I'll be back before you know it.

1158
01:26:46,970 --> 01:26:50,699
So you go get ready. We'll go see those chimpanzees.

1159
01:26:53,710 --> 01:26:57,109
Sarah... what are you doing?

1160
01:27:00,789 --> 01:27:03,779
Each of us have our vices.

1161
01:27:06,890 --> 01:27:09,359
Sarah, whatever you may think...

1162
01:27:10,930 --> 01:27:14,560
...your only competition for my affections is our little girl.

1163
01:27:14,630 --> 01:27:17,600
I love you. I will always love you

1164
01:27:17,670 --> 01:27:19,100
and you alone.

1165
01:27:20,970 --> 01:27:24,770
- You mean it today.
- Absolutely.

1166
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:28,680
Which makes it so much harder when you don't.

1167
01:27:38,020 --> 01:27:40,819
More shopping. She does love the smell of money.

1168
01:27:40,890 --> 01:27:45,189
The little lady wants to go to the zoo, so I thought you could take her, yeah?

1169
01:27:45,270 --> 01:27:47,630
I mean, I can do it tomorrow, if not.

1170
01:27:47,699 --> 01:27:51,000
And, uh... Sarah,

1171
01:27:51,069 --> 01:27:53,199
she knows.

1172
01:27:53,270 --> 01:27:57,439
Uh, at least she knows that something is not right,

1173
01:27:57,510 --> 01:28:00,409
so if you can just do whatever you can to help me.

1174
01:28:00,479 --> 01:28:05,039
Talk to her, just convince her that I do love her.

1175
01:28:15,699 --> 01:28:17,659
What is it, Freddie?

1176
01:28:17,729 --> 01:28:20,029
Listen, don't call me that, please.

1177
01:28:20,100 --> 01:28:23,970
It's nothing. It's just that sometimes it seems wrong.

1178
01:28:24,039 --> 01:28:26,529
I told you, when you're with me, you're with me.

1179
01:28:26,609 --> 01:28:29,630
Leave your family at home where they belong.

1180
01:28:29,710 --> 01:28:32,970
I'm trying. I'm trying, Olivia.

1181
01:28:33,050 --> 01:28:35,409
- I'll get dressed.
- Yeah.

1182
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:39,939
I saw Fallon hanging around again.

1183
01:28:40,020 --> 01:28:42,489
There's something about that man I don't trust.

1184
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:45,619
You trust me? Then trust Fallon.

1185
01:28:45,689 --> 01:28:48,350
He protects the things that I care about.

1186
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:29,090
We're sorry to see you go, Mr. Angier.

1187
01:29:29,170 --> 01:29:31,729
We were sorry to see Mr. Tesla leave, as well.

1188
01:29:31,909 --> 01:29:33,899
He's very good to Colorado Springs.

1189
01:29:33,970 --> 01:29:36,640
Mr. Angier,

1190
01:29:36,710 --> 01:29:40,340
I didn't think it was necessary to tell Edison's men about the box.

1191
01:29:40,409 --> 01:29:42,069
What box?

1192
01:30:07,409 --> 01:30:09,909
I apologize for leaving without saying goodbye.

1193
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:16,109
But I seem to have outstayed my welcome in Colorado.

1194
01:30:16,180 --> 01:30:20,680
The truly extraordinary is not permitted in science and industry.

1195
01:30:20,750 --> 01:30:23,550
Perhaps you'll find more luck in your field,

1196
01:30:23,619 --> 01:30:26,289
where people are happy to be mystified.

1197
01:30:26,359 --> 01:30:30,319
You will find what you are looking for in this box.

1198
01:30:30,399 --> 01:30:34,829
Alley has written you a thorough set of instructions.

1199
01:30:34,899 --> 01:30:39,630
I add only one suggestion on using the machine.

1200
01:30:39,710 --> 01:30:41,670
Destroy it.

1201
01:30:41,739 --> 01:30:45,039
Drop it to the bottom of the deepest ocean.

1202
01:30:45,109 --> 01:30:48,510
Such a thing will bring you only misery.

1203
01:30:52,390 --> 01:30:56,010
Tesla's warning is as unheeded as he knew it would be.

1204
01:30:56,090 --> 01:30:59,649
Today I tested the machine. Taking precautions in case

1205
01:30:59,729 --> 01:31:02,699
Tesla hadn't ironed out the kinks in its operation.

1206
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:04,560
But if it went wrong,

1207
01:31:04,630 --> 01:31:06,789
I would not want to live like that for long.

1208
01:31:26,250 --> 01:31:30,380
But here at the turn, I must leave you, Borden.

1209
01:31:30,460 --> 01:31:32,689
Yes, you, Borden,

1210
01:31:32,760 --> 01:31:35,130
sitting there in your cell,

1211
01:31:35,199 --> 01:31:39,220
reading my diary, awaiting your death,

1212
01:31:39,300 --> 01:31:41,289
for my murder.

1213
01:31:46,640 --> 01:31:49,939
Angier's journal, that gesture of good faith, that's a fake.

1214
01:31:50,010 --> 01:31:51,310
I assure you, it's not.

1215
01:31:51,380 --> 01:31:54,310
The provenance of the journal is clear and under no doubt.

1216
01:31:54,380 --> 01:31:58,869
And it's written in Angier's own hand, for which we have numerous examples.

1217
01:32:00,750 --> 01:32:02,649
It don't matter.

1218
01:32:04,590 --> 01:32:06,619
So my tricks.

1219
01:32:09,859 --> 01:32:13,319
- All of them.
- Including The Transported Man?

1220
01:32:14,770 --> 01:32:17,960
- Lord Caldlow will be very pleased.
- No, he won't.

1221
01:32:18,039 --> 01:32:20,399
They're not complete.

1222
01:32:20,470 --> 01:32:23,199
It's just the pledge and the turn for each.

1223
01:32:23,279 --> 01:32:27,340
Without the prestige for these tricks, these are worthless.

1224
01:32:27,409 --> 01:32:29,439
Yeah.

1225
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:33,039
You get the rest of it... when you bring my daughter here.

1226
01:32:35,789 --> 01:32:38,020
I want to say goodbye.

1227
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:42,920
We have to go through it now. We have to go through it now.

1228
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,359
Now, listen to me, deny it all you want.

1229
01:32:45,430 --> 01:32:47,800
Olivia means nothing.

1230
01:32:47,869 --> 01:32:49,659
- Olivia?
- I need an assistant.

1231
01:32:49,739 --> 01:32:52,569
- I'll go to her, I'll tell her.
- You'll tell her what?

1232
01:32:52,640 --> 01:32:54,699
I know what you really are, Alfred.

1233
01:32:55,909 --> 01:32:58,569
- I know.
- Sarah, Sarah, Sarah.

1234
01:32:58,649 --> 01:33:01,270
- I can't keep it in.
- You can't talk like this.

1235
01:33:01,350 --> 01:33:03,869
- No. No.
- Sarah, shut up! Sarah, shut up!

1236
01:33:03,949 --> 01:33:08,079
I don't want to hear it anymore. You can't talk like this.

1237
01:33:10,689 --> 01:33:14,090
You can't hide it anymore, because I know, Alfred, I know.

1238
01:33:14,159 --> 01:33:17,600
I know what you really are, Alfred.

1239
01:33:17,659 --> 01:33:20,460
I can't live like this.

1240
01:33:20,529 --> 01:33:22,659
Oh, well, you think I can live like this?

1241
01:33:22,739 --> 01:33:25,899
You think I bloody enjoy living like this?

1242
01:33:25,970 --> 01:33:30,380
We have this beautiful house, lovely little girl, we're married.

1243
01:33:30,439 --> 01:33:32,100
What is so wrong with your life?

1244
01:33:32,180 --> 01:33:34,770
Alfred, I can't live like this!

1245
01:33:34,850 --> 01:33:37,210
Well, what do you want from me?

1246
01:33:40,550 --> 01:33:44,250
I... I want...

1247
01:33:44,319 --> 01:33:47,380
I want you to be... honest with me.

1248
01:33:50,130 --> 01:33:52,600
No tricks.

1249
01:33:52,670 --> 01:33:54,760
No lies.

1250
01:33:54,829 --> 01:33:58,630
And no secrets.

1251
01:34:04,909 --> 01:34:08,239
Do you... do you love me?

1252
01:34:11,319 --> 01:34:12,939
Not today.

1253
01:34:15,090 --> 01:34:16,149
No.

1254
01:35:53,819 --> 01:35:54,840
Who's there?

1255
01:35:57,989 --> 01:36:00,079
I'm looking for an old friend.

1256
01:36:00,159 --> 01:36:03,090
I heard about a booking, nice little theater,

1257
01:36:03,159 --> 01:36:05,600
- good up-and-coming magician.
- You're back.

1258
01:36:05,670 --> 01:36:07,260
It's good to see you, John.

1259
01:36:08,029 --> 01:36:10,760
Good rehearsal space.

1260
01:36:10,840 --> 01:36:13,600
Blind stagehands, I like it.

1261
01:36:13,670 --> 01:36:16,340
You always had a good eye for publicity.

1262
01:36:16,409 --> 01:36:17,739
I need your help, John.

1263
01:36:17,810 --> 01:36:20,609
It's my last show. A limited engagement.

1264
01:36:20,680 --> 01:36:22,310
Your last show?

1265
01:36:22,380 --> 01:36:26,510
A wise man once told me obsession was a young man's game.

1266
01:36:26,590 --> 01:36:30,149
I'm almost done. There's one thing left.

1267
01:36:31,159 --> 01:36:33,680
The Real Transported Man.

1268
01:36:35,500 --> 01:36:37,489
You want to design a show around it?

1269
01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:40,430
I don't want you backstage I need you in front managing.

1270
01:36:40,500 --> 01:36:43,159
Call in any favors or connections you have left

1271
01:36:43,239 --> 01:36:44,699
to get us the right booking.

1272
01:36:44,770 --> 01:36:46,859
What sort of booking you after?

1273
01:36:46,939 --> 01:36:49,340
The sort that Borden can't ignore.

1274
01:36:55,720 --> 01:36:58,949
Oh, what an honor it is to see you again, sir.

1275
01:36:59,020 --> 01:37:02,979
You told me you only wanted to show me one trick that'd pique my interest.

1276
01:37:03,060 --> 01:37:06,220
- It's a very clever trick.
- Pleased to meet you, Mr. Ackerman.

1277
01:37:06,289 --> 01:37:09,159
Likewise, I'm sure. Let's get on, shall we?

1278
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:14,560
Turn it on, gentlemen.

1279
01:37:18,909 --> 01:37:20,930
Very pretty.

1280
01:37:31,979 --> 01:37:35,649
That's it, Cutter? He simply disappears?

1281
01:37:35,720 --> 01:37:38,090
That's not a trick. He has to come back.

1282
01:37:38,159 --> 01:37:40,319
- There has to be a...
- A prestige?

1283
01:37:40,390 --> 01:37:41,380
Exactly.

1284
01:37:44,399 --> 01:37:47,060
Pardon me.

1285
01:37:47,130 --> 01:37:50,399
It's very rare to see...

1286
01:37:50,470 --> 01:37:51,939
...real magic.

1287
01:37:53,439 --> 01:37:55,130
It's been many years since...

1288
01:37:55,210 --> 01:37:56,939
Are you interested in helping us?

1289
01:37:59,010 --> 01:38:02,739
Yes... but you'll have to dress it up a little.

1290
01:38:05,020 --> 01:38:06,680
Disguise it.

1291
01:38:08,350 --> 01:38:10,850
Give them enough reason to doubt it.

1292
01:38:11,659 --> 01:38:14,890
You haven't spoken about her, Freddie, not once.

1293
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:18,659
Why would I talk about her to you, hm?

1294
01:38:18,729 --> 01:38:22,600
Because she was a part of your life and now she's gone.

1295
01:38:25,569 --> 01:38:30,069
You know, the day before she killed herself she said she wanted to meet me.

1296
01:38:30,140 --> 01:38:33,079
That she had something to tell me about you.

1297
01:38:33,149 --> 01:38:36,739
I was such a coward, I couldn't bring myself to face her.

1298
01:38:36,819 --> 01:38:38,310
But...

1299
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:41,779
...what would she have said?

1300
01:38:41,850 --> 01:38:44,949
You want to know the truth about me?

1301
01:38:46,229 --> 01:38:48,720
The truth is that...

1302
01:38:50,899 --> 01:38:52,890
...I never loved Sarah.

1303
01:38:54,100 --> 01:38:55,590
I never loved her.

1304
01:38:55,670 --> 01:38:57,899
You married her, you had a child with her.

1305
01:38:57,970 --> 01:39:01,060
Yes. Part of me. Part of me did, but...

1306
01:39:01,140 --> 01:39:03,069
...the other part didn't.

1307
01:39:03,140 --> 01:39:07,369
The part that found you, the part that's sitting here right now.

1308
01:39:07,449 --> 01:39:10,510
I love you. No, Olivia, I love you.

1309
01:39:10,579 --> 01:39:12,550
That's the truth.

1310
01:39:12,619 --> 01:39:15,020
That is the truth that matters.

1311
01:39:15,090 --> 01:39:19,489
You could be in some other restaurant with some other woman right now,

1312
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:21,149
talking about me that way.

1313
01:39:21,229 --> 01:39:23,350
- No.
- Yes.

1314
01:39:26,800 --> 01:39:30,529
It's inhuman to be so cold.

1315
01:39:36,210 --> 01:39:37,470
He's back.

1316
01:39:38,380 --> 01:39:41,640
After two years, he's got a new trick.

1317
01:39:41,710 --> 01:39:44,380
They're saying it's the best London's ever seen.

1318
01:39:46,590 --> 01:39:49,050
You should see the look on your face, Professor.

1319
01:39:50,920 --> 01:39:52,859
You should go to him.

1320
01:39:52,930 --> 01:39:55,449
You two deserve each other.

1321
01:40:00,430 --> 01:40:04,369
But I'm afraid I'm booked. The Moscow Ballet plays through next year.

1322
01:40:04,439 --> 01:40:09,000
Then get rid of them. There will be 100 performances, no more, no less.

1323
01:40:09,079 --> 01:40:11,569
Five performances a week, no matinees.

1324
01:40:13,380 --> 01:40:16,409
That's what you'll charge for each ticket. Good day.

1325
01:40:39,140 --> 01:40:43,770
Ladies and gentlemen, my first trick of the evening involves considerable risk.

1326
01:40:45,010 --> 01:40:46,380
Anyone in the audience

1327
01:40:46,449 --> 01:40:49,279
who would be irrevocably damaged by seeing a man drown

1328
01:40:49,350 --> 01:40:50,939
should leave now.

1329
01:40:51,020 --> 01:40:53,810
When I tell you the lady who taught me this illusion

1330
01:40:53,890 --> 01:40:55,880
actually died performing it,

1331
01:40:55,960 --> 01:40:59,250
you'll understand the seriousness of the dangers involved.

1332
01:41:01,430 --> 01:41:03,829
Let's begin.

1333
01:41:13,539 --> 01:41:16,170
In my travels, I have seen the future.

1334
01:41:17,979 --> 01:41:21,569
And it is a strange future, indeed.

1335
01:41:21,649 --> 01:41:22,909
The world, ladies and gentlemen,

1336
01:41:23,880 --> 01:41:26,180
is on the brink of new

1337
01:41:26,250 --> 01:41:27,979
and terrifying possibilities.

1338
01:41:48,470 --> 01:41:51,930
What you're about to witness is not magic.

1339
01:41:53,109 --> 01:41:54,510
It's purely science.

1340
01:41:54,579 --> 01:41:57,010
I'd like to invite you to come up on stage now

1341
01:41:57,079 --> 01:42:00,069
so that you can examine the machine for yourselves.

1342
01:42:55,369 --> 01:42:57,210
Man's reach

1343
01:42:57,279 --> 01:43:00,399
exceeds his imagination.

1344
01:43:11,689 --> 01:43:13,060
Bravo!

1345
01:43:21,100 --> 01:43:23,829
One hundred performances. Why?

1346
01:43:23,899 --> 01:43:25,460
Does his method dictate that?

1347
01:43:25,539 --> 01:43:27,439
Is it a publicity move? What is it?

1348
01:43:27,510 --> 01:43:29,869
He's a no-talent magician, and they call him

1349
01:43:29,939 --> 01:43:32,340
the bloody best in England. Why?

1350
01:43:32,409 --> 01:43:35,180
Fifty yards in a second! In a second!

1351
01:43:35,250 --> 01:43:38,340
And all that we know is he uses a trap door.

1352
01:43:38,420 --> 01:43:42,680
Brilliant! What is going on under that stage? Huh?!

1353
01:43:42,760 --> 01:43:45,189
Why can't you out-think him?

1354
01:44:00,310 --> 01:44:05,510
They do this every night, after each performance. Yeah?

1355
01:44:31,800 --> 01:44:33,140
Huh.

1356
01:44:34,010 --> 01:44:36,979
We're done.

1357
01:44:38,279 --> 01:44:39,840
All right?

1358
01:44:41,149 --> 01:44:42,909
Let him have his trick.

1359
01:44:42,979 --> 01:44:45,470
I don't need his secret.

1360
01:44:45,550 --> 01:44:47,039
So...

1361
01:44:48,550 --> 01:44:51,520
...don't go back there, you leave him alone.

1362
01:44:51,590 --> 01:44:54,859
Both of us... just leave him alone.

1363
01:44:54,930 --> 01:44:56,550
We're done.

1364
01:45:05,300 --> 01:45:07,359
I told you, John.

1365
01:45:07,439 --> 01:45:09,529
I don't want you backstage on this one.

1366
01:45:11,180 --> 01:45:13,579
I would like to invite you onstage now

1367
01:45:13,649 --> 01:45:16,340
so that you can examine the machine for yourselves.

1368
01:45:45,539 --> 01:45:49,279
- Hey, where do you think...?
- I'm part of the bloody act, you fool.

1369
01:45:58,289 --> 01:45:59,279
Who was that?

1370
01:46:55,850 --> 01:46:59,979
Hey! Where's the bloody key?!

1371
01:47:00,050 --> 01:47:01,609
Where's the bloody key?!

1372
01:47:04,060 --> 01:47:07,789
Where's the bloody key?! He's bloody drowning!

1373
01:47:17,039 --> 01:47:18,020
Hold on!

1374
01:47:23,340 --> 01:47:23,909
What have you done?

1375
01:47:46,630 --> 01:47:52,069
Alfred Borden, you have been found guilty of the murder of Robert Angier.

1376
01:47:52,140 --> 01:47:56,369
You will be hanged by the neck until dead.

1377
01:47:56,439 --> 01:47:59,409
May the Lord have mercy on your soul.

1378
01:48:01,180 --> 01:48:03,340
Mr. Cutter?

1379
01:48:03,420 --> 01:48:05,039
Owens.

1380
01:48:05,119 --> 01:48:07,949
Oh, thank you for coming, Mr. Owens.

1381
01:48:08,020 --> 01:48:12,390
It has fallen to me to dispose of Mr. Angier's equipment.

1382
01:48:12,460 --> 01:48:14,050
But I notice from this manifest

1383
01:48:14,130 --> 01:48:17,819
that Lord Caldlow has purchased the bulk of the items.

1384
01:48:17,899 --> 01:48:21,199
Mr. Cutter, if you need to know where to deliver these items...

1385
01:48:21,270 --> 01:48:24,859
No, it's just there is one particular item,

1386
01:48:25,800 --> 01:48:28,399
this item, in fact,

1387
01:48:28,470 --> 01:48:30,739
- I would like to...
- You would like to...

1388
01:48:30,909 --> 01:48:31,899
...buy.

1389
01:48:31,979 --> 01:48:33,880
- Buy yourself?
- Yeah, I suppose so.

1390
01:48:35,109 --> 01:48:37,050
- This is the machine?
- Yes.

1391
01:48:37,119 --> 01:48:39,350
Well, I'm afraid Lord Caldlow was adamant

1392
01:48:39,420 --> 01:48:41,649
about purchasing this particular item.

1393
01:48:41,720 --> 01:48:44,810
Do you think I could talk to Lord Caldlow in person?

1394
01:48:44,890 --> 01:48:47,649
Out of the question, I'm afraid.

1395
01:48:50,100 --> 01:48:52,000
Of course,

1396
01:48:52,060 --> 01:48:55,300
I suppose if, in the course of your delivery arrangements,

1397
01:48:55,369 --> 01:48:59,829
your paths were to cross, I can't stop you speaking your mind.

1398
01:48:59,909 --> 01:49:01,930
Thank you.

1399
01:49:03,510 --> 01:49:05,670
- Still here, Borden?
- For now.

1400
01:49:06,279 --> 01:49:09,250
You got a visitor. Lord Caldlow.

1401
01:49:09,310 --> 01:49:11,409
With a little girl.

1402
01:49:19,689 --> 01:49:21,590
Jess?

1403
01:49:21,659 --> 01:49:23,289
Hello, my love.

1404
01:49:23,359 --> 01:49:26,819
How are you? I've missed you so much.

1405
01:49:26,899 --> 01:49:29,029
Fallon's missed you too. We both have.

1406
01:49:29,100 --> 01:49:31,430
Daddy, can I come in there?

1407
01:49:32,069 --> 01:49:34,699
Not right now. Not right now, darling.

1408
01:49:34,770 --> 01:49:37,039
No, but everything is gonna be all right.

1409
01:49:38,609 --> 01:49:40,340
You must be Lord Caldlow?

1410
01:49:40,409 --> 01:49:44,140
Caldlow. Yes, I am. I always have been.

1411
01:49:49,189 --> 01:49:51,380
They flatter you with all those chains.

1412
01:49:51,460 --> 01:49:54,479
Don't they know you can't escape without your rubber ball?

1413
01:49:54,560 --> 01:49:57,550
I pulled you out... out of that tank.

1414
01:49:57,630 --> 01:50:01,460
All I wanted to do was prove that I was a better magician.

1415
01:50:01,529 --> 01:50:03,430
But you couldn't leave me alone.

1416
01:50:04,939 --> 01:50:07,029
I don't know what you've done.

1417
01:50:08,939 --> 01:50:12,640
But you're not afraid to get your hands dirty anymore, are you?

1418
01:50:12,710 --> 01:50:15,979
No, not anymore. And I win.

1419
01:50:16,050 --> 01:50:19,380
No one cares about the man in the box, the man who disappears.

1420
01:50:19,449 --> 01:50:20,579
You win?

1421
01:50:22,020 --> 01:50:26,680
This ain't a bloody competition anymore. This is my little girl's life.

1422
01:50:26,760 --> 01:50:29,750
And don't you dare put her in the middle of this.

1423
01:50:29,829 --> 01:50:32,819
Oh, I know how hard it is to have someone so special

1424
01:50:32,899 --> 01:50:35,260
taken away from you, don't I, Borden?

1425
01:50:36,270 --> 01:50:39,000
And you can't take it with you, now, can you?

1426
01:50:39,069 --> 01:50:40,970
Oh, she'll be looked after.

1427
01:50:41,039 --> 01:50:43,060
Goodbye, Professor. Come on, darling.

1428
01:50:43,140 --> 01:50:44,899
No, no, no, no, stop, my darling.

1429
01:50:44,979 --> 01:50:47,100
Look, here.

1430
01:50:48,649 --> 01:50:51,909
That's what you're after. That's what this is about.

1431
01:50:52,720 --> 01:50:54,079
Take it.

1432
01:50:54,149 --> 01:50:55,850
- Your secret?
- Yeah.

1433
01:50:59,060 --> 01:51:02,619
You always were the better magician. We both know that.

1434
01:51:03,260 --> 01:51:05,859
Whatever your secret was, you have to agree,

1435
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:08,329
mine is better.

1436
01:51:10,039 --> 01:51:13,399
Don't do this. Don't do this, Angier. Jess, Jess!

1437
01:51:13,470 --> 01:51:17,000
Jess, I'm gonna take you home soon. I promise.

1438
01:51:17,079 --> 01:51:19,640
- For God's sake.
- I promise. Look!

1439
01:51:23,479 --> 01:51:27,079
I promise. I love you, Jess.

1440
01:51:27,149 --> 01:51:28,810
I love you.

1441
01:51:28,890 --> 01:51:30,510
- Come on.
- I love you.

1442
01:51:30,590 --> 01:51:32,279
I love you, Jess.

1443
01:51:32,359 --> 01:51:34,689
Angier! Angier!

1444
01:51:34,760 --> 01:51:36,850
What, do you think this place can hold me?

1445
01:51:36,930 --> 01:51:39,949
Angier! They're gonna bloody hang me!

1446
01:51:40,029 --> 01:51:42,560
And you can put a stop to this now!

1447
01:51:43,199 --> 01:51:45,399
Listen! Listen! That man...

1448
01:51:45,470 --> 01:51:47,840
Listen, that man is the one I'm in for killing!

1449
01:51:47,909 --> 01:51:52,239
Listen! If he's alive, I'm not guilty!

1450
01:51:52,310 --> 01:51:54,569
- I'm not guilty!
- I don't care!

1451
01:51:54,649 --> 01:51:56,739
- Get hold of him.
- Angier!

1452
01:52:01,420 --> 01:52:03,979
Run along now.

1453
01:52:04,060 --> 01:52:06,579
Sir, there's a gentleman waiting.

1454
01:52:23,409 --> 01:52:26,140
- Dear God.
- Hello, Cutter.

1455
01:52:27,109 --> 01:52:29,550
You're still alive.

1456
01:52:29,609 --> 01:52:31,479
How is it you're still alive?

1457
01:52:31,550 --> 01:52:33,949
I saw you on a slab, for God's sake.

1458
01:52:36,960 --> 01:52:38,979
- Child.
- Good night, sir.

1459
01:52:39,060 --> 01:52:41,029
Good night, Jess.

1460
01:52:42,260 --> 01:52:43,920
I've seen her before.

1461
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,520
I saw her in court with...

1462
01:52:47,470 --> 01:52:49,090
...Fallon.

1463
01:52:51,199 --> 01:52:53,800
- What have you done?
- She needs looking after.

1464
01:52:53,869 --> 01:52:56,359
She needs her father.

1465
01:52:56,439 --> 01:52:59,409
You're letting him hang, and I helped you.

1466
01:52:59,479 --> 01:53:04,420
I came here to beg Lord Caldlow to let me destroy that machine.

1467
01:53:05,880 --> 01:53:09,319
I am not going to beg you for anything.

1468
01:53:09,390 --> 01:53:12,649
You don't have to. I'm gonna make sure it is never used again.

1469
01:53:13,789 --> 01:53:16,890
Then, Lord Caldlow...

1470
01:53:19,430 --> 01:53:21,489
...where do you want me to deliver it?

1471
01:53:21,569 --> 01:53:25,329
My theater. It belongs with the prestige materials.

1472
01:53:25,800 --> 01:53:28,399
John, I tried not to involve you.

1473
01:53:41,350 --> 01:53:43,619
So...

1474
01:53:45,659 --> 01:53:48,250
We go alone now.

1475
01:53:48,329 --> 01:53:50,760
Both of us.

1476
01:53:53,569 --> 01:53:56,970
I mean, I don't have as far to go as you.

1477
01:54:02,270 --> 01:54:03,609
No.

1478
01:54:05,140 --> 01:54:08,199
You were right. I should have left him to his damn trick.

1479
01:54:09,979 --> 01:54:12,069
I'm sorry.

1480
01:54:13,619 --> 01:54:15,949
I'm sorry for a lot of things.

1481
01:54:17,090 --> 01:54:19,819
I'm sorry about Sarah.

1482
01:54:20,930 --> 01:54:24,380
Didn't mean to hurt her, I didn't.

1483
01:54:26,260 --> 01:54:30,600
You go live your life in full now, all right? You live for both of us.

1484
01:54:39,439 --> 01:54:40,930
Goodbye.

1485
01:55:26,729 --> 01:55:29,159
Are you watching closely?

1486
01:56:00,529 --> 01:56:02,460
Put it down on the end.

1487
01:56:35,859 --> 01:56:39,630
Take a minute to consider your achievement.

1488
01:56:40,699 --> 01:56:43,500
I once told you about a sailor

1489
01:56:43,569 --> 01:56:45,869
who described drowning to me.

1490
01:56:45,939 --> 01:56:48,130
Yes, he said it was like going home.

1491
01:56:49,239 --> 01:56:53,010
I was lying. He said it was agony.

1492
01:57:32,750 --> 01:57:36,920
Alfred Borden, this day, in the name of the king

1493
01:57:36,989 --> 01:57:38,979
and the High Court of England,

1494
01:57:39,060 --> 01:57:40,890
you will meet your end.

1495
01:57:42,989 --> 01:57:45,020
No one cares about the man in the box.

1496
01:57:49,869 --> 01:57:51,600
Cutter?

1497
01:57:56,270 --> 01:57:57,800
Cutter!

1498
01:57:59,680 --> 01:58:01,939
Do you have anything to say?

1499
01:58:06,680 --> 01:58:08,079
Abracadabra.

1500
01:58:44,720 --> 01:58:47,449
A brother? A twin?

1501
01:58:49,289 --> 01:58:51,659
You were Fallon.

1502
01:58:53,159 --> 01:58:55,829
- The whole time?
- No.

1503
01:58:56,869 --> 01:58:59,199
We were both Fallon.

1504
01:58:59,270 --> 01:59:01,170
We were both Borden.

1505
01:59:06,539 --> 01:59:09,510
Were you the one who went into the box?

1506
01:59:09,579 --> 01:59:11,279
Or the one who came back out?

1507
01:59:12,579 --> 01:59:14,880
We took turns.

1508
01:59:19,689 --> 01:59:21,750
The trick is where we would swap.

1509
01:59:27,970 --> 01:59:29,869
Cutter knew. Cutter knew.

1510
01:59:29,930 --> 01:59:32,199
But I told him it was too simple, too easy.

1511
01:59:33,399 --> 01:59:34,390
No.

1512
01:59:35,939 --> 01:59:37,909
Simple, maybe, but not easy.

1513
01:59:37,979 --> 01:59:41,739
There's nothing easy about two men sharing one life.

1514
01:59:47,420 --> 01:59:50,619
I don't understand, how it can be bleeding again?

1515
01:59:54,090 --> 01:59:56,890
Wha... What about Olivia and your wife?

1516
01:59:57,899 --> 01:59:59,800
We each loved one of them.

1517
02:00:03,430 --> 02:00:06,159
I loved Sarah.

1518
02:00:06,239 --> 02:00:08,760
He loved Olivia.

1519
02:00:08,840 --> 02:00:11,270
We each had half of a full life,

1520
02:00:11,340 --> 02:00:14,329
really, which was enough for us...

1521
02:00:14,409 --> 02:00:15,399
...just.

1522
02:00:18,050 --> 02:00:19,779
But not for them.

1523
02:00:22,350 --> 02:00:24,579
See, sacrifice, Robert,

1524
02:00:24,659 --> 02:00:27,390
that's the price of a good trick.

1525
02:00:29,430 --> 02:00:31,989
You wouldn't know anything about that, would you?

1526
02:00:35,270 --> 02:00:37,199
I've... I've made sacrifices.

1527
02:00:37,270 --> 02:00:39,239
- No.
- Yes.

1528
02:00:39,699 --> 02:00:42,800
It takes nothing to steal another man's work.

1529
02:00:42,869 --> 02:00:45,640
Yeah, it takes everything.

1530
02:01:05,699 --> 02:01:07,819
No, no, wait, I'm not...

1531
02:01:14,510 --> 02:01:17,130
It took courage.

1532
02:01:19,140 --> 02:01:22,340
It took courage to climb into that machine every night,

1533
02:01:23,149 --> 02:01:25,579
not knowing...

1534
02:01:25,649 --> 02:01:27,779
...if I'd be the man in the box...

1535
02:01:30,819 --> 02:01:32,079
...or in the prestige.

1536
02:01:33,420 --> 02:01:36,449
Do you want to see...

1537
02:01:36,529 --> 02:01:38,829
...what it cost me?

1538
02:01:38,899 --> 02:01:41,659
You didn't see where you are, did you?

1539
02:01:42,569 --> 02:01:44,970
Look. Look.

1540
02:01:46,069 --> 02:01:47,560
I don't care.

1541
02:01:52,279 --> 02:01:55,840
You went halfway around the world.

1542
02:01:55,909 --> 02:01:58,680
You spent a fortune.

1543
02:02:00,750 --> 02:02:03,279
You did terrible things.

1544
02:02:04,289 --> 02:02:06,760
Really terrible things, Robert.

1545
02:02:08,789 --> 02:02:10,279
And all for nothing.

1546
02:02:11,260 --> 02:02:12,460
For nothing?

1547
02:02:12,529 --> 02:02:13,859
Yeah.

1548
02:02:17,539 --> 02:02:20,159
You never understood...

1549
02:02:20,239 --> 02:02:22,229
...why we did this.

1550
02:02:25,340 --> 02:02:27,899
The audience knows the truth.

1551
02:02:29,050 --> 02:02:31,479
The world is simple.

1552
02:02:31,550 --> 02:02:33,279
It's miserable.

1553
02:02:33,350 --> 02:02:37,050
Solid... Solid all the way through.

1554
02:02:39,390 --> 02:02:41,720
But if you could fool them,

1555
02:02:41,789 --> 02:02:43,949
even for a second...

1556
02:02:45,500 --> 02:02:47,899
...then you could make them wonder.

1557
02:02:49,029 --> 02:02:51,229
And then you...

1558
02:02:51,300 --> 02:02:53,529
Then you got to see something

1559
02:02:53,600 --> 02:02:55,270
very special.

1560
02:02:59,579 --> 02:03:02,100
You really don't know.

1561
02:03:05,180 --> 02:03:06,840
It was...

1562
02:03:07,920 --> 02:03:10,890
...it was the look on their faces.

1563
02:03:26,069 --> 02:03:30,909
Every magic trick consists of three parts, or acts.

1564
02:03:34,350 --> 02:03:37,800
The first part is called "the pledge".

1565
02:03:37,880 --> 02:03:40,649
The magician shows you something ordinary.

1566
02:03:41,789 --> 02:03:44,720
The second act is called "the turn".

1567
02:03:46,189 --> 02:03:49,060
The magician takes the ordinary something

1568
02:03:49,130 --> 02:03:51,989
and makes it into something extraordinary.

1569
02:03:53,329 --> 02:03:57,229
But you wouldn't clap yet, because making something disappear

1570
02:03:57,300 --> 02:04:01,399
isn't enough. You have to bring it back.

1571
02:04:35,840 --> 02:04:38,270
Now you're looking for the secret.

1572
02:04:41,210 --> 02:04:44,939
But you won't find it, because, of course, you're not really looking.

1573
02:04:48,050 --> 02:04:51,489
You don't really want to work it out.

1574
02:04:54,289 --> 02:04:56,590
You want to be fooled.
