2
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:32,331
I'm out in the prime cut
of the big green.

3
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:37,062
Behind me is Ed and Rowdy, members
of an up-and-coming subadult gang.

4
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,469
They're challenging everything, including me.
Goes with the territory.

5
00:00:40,573 --> 00:00:44,407
If I show weakness,
if I retreat,

6
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:46,706
I may be hurt,
I may be killed.

7
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:50,214
I must hold my own
if I'm gonna stay within this land.

8
00:00:50,316 --> 00:00:52,978
For once there is weakness,
they will exploit it, they will take me out,

9
00:00:53,086 --> 00:00:56,852
they will decapitate me,
they will chop me into bits and pieces.

10
00:00:56,956 --> 00:00:58,924
I'm dead.

11
00:00:59,025 --> 00:01:03,086
But so far, I persevere.

12
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:04,629
Persevere.

13
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,630
Most times
I'm a kind warrior out here.

14
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:13,536
Most times, I am gentle,
I am like a flower,

15
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,269
I'm like... I'm like
a fly on the wall,

16
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:21,473
observing, noncommittal,
noninvasive in any way.

17
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:24,243
Occasionally I am challenged.
And in that case,

18
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:27,547
the kind warrior must,
must, must become a samurai.

19
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:29,679
Must become so,

20
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,782
so formidable,

21
00:01:33,993 --> 00:01:36,461
so fearless of death,

22
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:37,996
so strong

23
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:41,794
that he will win, he will win.

24
00:01:41,901 --> 00:01:45,632
Even the bears will believe
that you are more powerful.

25
00:01:45,738 --> 00:01:49,139
And in a sense
you must be more powerful

26
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:53,372
if you are to survive in this land
with the bear.

27
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,916
No one knew that.
No one ever friggin' knew

28
00:01:57,016 --> 00:02:01,214
that there are times when my life
is on the precipice of death

29
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:04,552
and that these bears can bite,
they can kill.

30
00:02:04,657 --> 00:02:07,091
And if I am weak,
I go down.

31
00:02:07,193 --> 00:02:09,127
I love them with all my heart.
I will protect them.

32
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:13,757
I will die for them, but I will not die
at their claws and paws.

33
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:17,359
I will fight. I will be strong.
I'll be one of them.

34
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,268
I will be... the master.

35
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:25,374
But still a kind warrior.

36
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:34,911
Love you, Rowdy.

37
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:37,512
Give it to me, baby.

38
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:39,649
That's what I'm talkin' about.
That's what I'm talkin' about.

39
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:41,624
That's what I'm talkin' about.

40
00:02:44,397 --> 00:02:48,163
I can smell death
all over my fingers.

41
00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:16,858
<i>All these majestic creatures were filmed
by Timothy Treadwell</i>

42
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:21,332
<i>who lived among wild grizzlies
for 13 summers.</i>

43
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:27,064
<i>He went to remote areas
of the Alaskan peninsula</i>

44
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:29,437
<i>believing that
he was needed there</i>

45
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:34,309
<i>to protect these animals
and educate the public.</i>

46
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:37,406
<i>During his last five years
out there,</i>

47
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:39,542
<i>he took along a video camera</i>

48
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:43,679
<i>and shot over 100 hours
of footage.</i>

49
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:49,057
<i>What Treadwell intended was to show
these bears in their natural habitat.</i>

50
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:54,689
<i>Having myself filmed
in the wilderness of jungles,</i>

51
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:57,565
<i>I found that beyond
the wildlife film,</i>

52
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:00,332
<i>in his material lay
dormant a story</i>

53
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,068
<i>of astonishing beauty
and depth.</i>

54
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:08,405
<i>I discovered a film
of human ecstasies</i>

55
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:11,449
<i>and darkest inner turmoil.</i>

56
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:14,748
<i>As if there was
a desire in him</i>

57
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:18,119
<i>to leave the confinements
of his humanness</i>

58
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:20,158
<i>and bond with the bears,</i>

59
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:25,197
<i>Treadwell reached out,
seeking a primordial encounter.</i>

60
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:30,031
<i>But in doing so, he crossed
an invisible borderline.</i>

61
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,809
Go back and play.

62
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:59,488
Go ahead back. Go back.

63
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:01,692
Go back.

64
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:06,437
This is a subadult.
And this is what happens to them.

65
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:09,906
They work together,
and they get really powerful.

66
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:12,842
As you can see,
I'm just feet away.

67
00:05:12,945 --> 00:05:15,778
You just relax.
You just relax.

68
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:20,651
He's now moving away from me.

69
00:05:20,753 --> 00:05:25,918
I've now proven myself as being able to hold
my ground and therefore earning their respect.

70
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:29,222
This is Rowdy, the bear.
And he's rowdy.

71
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,297
He's gettin' bigger.

72
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:36,668
Knew him from... He was a little dot
a couple of years ago.

73
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:39,499
He's gettin' to be a big boy.
Anyway, we're doing just fine.

74
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,467
But that was a challenge,

75
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:45,510
and you have to remain cool
in the challenge, in the moment.

76
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:47,476
If you don't, you're dead.

77
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:51,676
They can kill. They can bite.
They can decapitate.

78
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:22,906
Excuse me. Hey.

79
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:25,711
Hey!

80
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:28,946
It's okay, it's okay. It's okay.

81
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,922
I didn't mean to get in your way.

82
00:06:32,024 --> 00:06:35,357
Wow. It's okay.
You're the boss.

83
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:39,795
Nice job. Wow! Nice job.

84
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:42,795
I gotta think, he was over ten-feet high,
don't you?

85
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,735
He's a big bear!
He's a big bear!

86
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:48,136
A very big bear! Wow!

87
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:52,303
Anyway, he's over here
rub-a-dub-dubbing.

88
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,039
He's a big bear!

89
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:56,809
<i>The excitement Treadwell felt</i>

90
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,817
<i>connected him immediately
with children.</i>

91
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,479
<i>In his campaign
to create awareness,</i>

92
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:05,318
<i>he reached thousands and thousands
of school children</i>

93
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,985
<i>who would remember
his fabulous storytelling</i>

94
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:12,087
<i>as one of the highlights
of their school years.</i>

95
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:14,689
<i>He took his mission
so seriously</i>

96
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:17,668
<i>that he never solicited for a fee.</i>

97
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:23,737
<i>Over time, he reached the status
of a national celebrity.</i>

98
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:28,342
<i>Timothy Treadwell is crazy
about grizzly bears.</i>

99
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,348
<i>How crazy? Sometimes...</i>

100
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,918
<i>It was as if he had become a star</i>

101
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:35,487
<i>by virtue of his own invention.</i>

102
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:39,684
I would be within
the physical presence of bears

103
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:42,886
24 hours a day
for months at a time.

104
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:46,431
<i>This is... crazy.
This is nuts.</i>

105
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:49,023
These are the most dangerous animals
on the face of the earth.

106
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,228
- Well...
- And you want to go

107
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:53,703
and put yourself in harm's way
24 hours a day?

108
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,501
I think they've been misunderstood.

109
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:59,476
<i>How can I believe that if you are
about to be killed by a bear,</i>

110
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:03,709
that you wouldn't say, "I made a mistake.
I'd like to have a gun"?

111
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:06,683
I would never, ever kill a bear
in defense of my own life.

112
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:09,880
Would not go into a bear's home
and kill a bear.

113
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:16,823
One day, I came home

114
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:20,296
and I was sitting on my patio.

115
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:23,493
My wife was in the bedroom
with the TV on.

116
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:26,629
And I heard her scream.

117
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,441
And I thought
she'd fallen or something.

118
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:34,570
I came in and she was sitting
on the edge of the bed,

119
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,841
staring at the television.

120
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:39,417
I looked at the television,

121
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,612
and I saw Timmy's face.

122
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:44,519
I hadn't heard the sound
or the news yet,

123
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:47,593
but I knew just by seeing
Timmy's face on TV

124
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:50,287
and hearing
my wife's reaction,

125
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:52,921
that the worst had happened.

126
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,830
Not necessarily a surprise,

127
00:08:57,003 --> 00:09:00,131
but... the worst.

128
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:04,633
<i>I never have days
when I grieve for Timmy</i>

129
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:08,145
<i>as I have with other friends
who have died.</i>

130
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:10,442
<i>They feel dead.</i>

131
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,040
<i>Timmy doesn't feel dead.</i>

132
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:18,985
<i>This is the last photo
of Timothy Treadwell.</i>

133
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:22,185
<i>It was taken at the beginning
of his 13th summer</i>

134
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:24,729
<i>in the wilds of Alaska.</i>

135
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:29,767
<i>With him is Amie Huguenard,
who would die by his side.</i>

136
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:34,237
<i>The man who took the photo
was Willy Fulton,</i>

137
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,137
<i>a close friend of Timothy's,</i>

138
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:39,268
<i>and the pilot
who would bring him to this remote part</i>

139
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:41,676
<i>of the Alaskan peninsula.</i>

140
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:47,217
<i>Treadwell saw himself
as the guardian of this land</i>

141
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,312
<i>and stylized himself
as Prince Valiant,</i>

142
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:55,383
<i>fighting the bad guys with their schemes
to do harm to the bears.</i>

143
00:09:55,494 --> 00:09:59,453
<i>But all this land is
a federally protected reserve,</i>

144
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:02,193
<i>part of Katmai National Park.</i>

145
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:16,279
<i>This big plain,
Treadwell called "The Sanctuary."</i>

146
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:18,873
<i>Here he would spend
the early summer months</i>

147
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:21,419
<i>before moving along
some 35 miles</i>

148
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,920
<i>to this densely overgrown area</i>

149
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:25,923
<i>which he called
"The Grizzly Maze"</i>

150
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:29,461
<i>where he would observe
the late summer salmon run.</i>

151
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:36,025
<i>It was here that Fulton
would pick him up in the fall.</i>

152
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:41,540
<i>On October 6 last year,
this is the spot here at Kaflia Lake</i>

153
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,337
<i>where I pulled in
to pick up Tim and Amie.</i>

154
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:49,614
<i>Typical day out here.
Rain, foggy, a lot of wind.</i>

155
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,941
<i>It was kinda strange.
Didn't see him, didn't hear anything.</i>

156
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:57,181
<i>No gear on the beach
or anything.</i>

157
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:59,814
I tied up, and I started
yelling a little bit.

158
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:03,486
"Tim! Amie!" And no answer.

159
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:07,191
I caught a little tiny bit
of movement up on the hill,

160
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:10,757
so I'm like, it was windy, maybe they
just couldn't hear me or something.

161
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:13,930
So I decided I'd go up
in the camp,

162
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,065
and see what was going on.

163
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:19,372
And headed off
up through the alders.

164
00:11:19,478 --> 00:11:22,311
It's kind of a thick trail
up into camp there.

165
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,841
Got about three-quarters
of the way up the hill,

166
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:31,514
and something just didn't feel right at all,
something seemed strange.

167
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:35,390
I'm yelling and no answer.
So I turned around

168
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:38,588
and started coming back down the trail
at a pretty good clip, I guess.

169
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:41,690
I was kinda... trottin' along.

170
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:45,703
And as I got in the thickest
part of the alders right here,

171
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:48,569
as I got near the airplane,
I just happened to turn around.

172
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:51,837
And I turned around
and looked and...

173
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:58,482
Pretty nasty-Iooking bear
that I had seen here before

174
00:11:58,584 --> 00:12:02,281
is just sneaking slow,
with his head down.

175
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:06,381
Just the meanest-Iooking thing
coming through the brush.

176
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:08,756
So I jumped on the airplane
real quick and untied it.

177
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:12,820
And took off. Turned around,
flew over camp there.

178
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:17,895
Just looked down
and saw a human rib cage

179
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:21,939
that I knew had to be
either Tim or Amie laying there.

180
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:24,441
And he was just eating that.

181
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:26,977
And as l...
So I circled around again.

182
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:29,411
<i>Got really low,
and tried to run him off.</i>

183
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:33,349
<i>Just over and over again with the airplane.
Every time I would come over,</i>

184
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:36,979
he'd just start eating faster
and faster and crouch over

185
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:39,580
this rib cage there.

186
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:42,058
And right at that time,

187
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:45,927
<i>I just realized, "Wow!</i>

188
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:49,967
I was pretty close to gettin' eaten myself"
is what I thought.

189
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:53,197
And this shot of adrenalin like
I've never had just came over me.

190
00:12:53,305 --> 00:12:56,468
And my throat went...
couldn't breathe.

191
00:12:56,575 --> 00:13:00,306
My face went numb.
My arms and legs went numb.

192
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:03,040
And then I called back...

193
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:05,413
back to the office,

194
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:07,952
and told them what happened out here,
what I thought had happened.

195
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:13,491
And that we would need some assistance
out here. That we had some problems.

196
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:20,355
After the Park Service arrived,
then I'm leading them up through the alders.

197
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:23,594
This is the same trail
that I'd come up the first time.

198
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:27,138
We got to about right here,
and we just stopped.

199
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:29,673
We stopped just to take
a look around.

200
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:34,735
Right then, one guy with us
just yells, "Bear!"

201
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:38,044
And they all spin around. These gun barrels
come over the top of my head.

202
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,243
Boy, they just start
firing them off.

203
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:42,411
I ducked down 'cause
they hadn't given me a gun.

204
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:45,217
I'd look up, and they'd fire
over and over again.

205
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:50,557
Then I look up when they're done firing
and there's just a cloud of smoke here.

206
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:53,359
I look over, and the bear
is laying right there.

207
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:56,059
They're yelling at me,
just don't go near the bear.

208
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,136
I knew he was dead.

209
00:13:58,237 --> 00:14:02,071
He'd been shot in the head
and the neck and everywhere.

210
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:05,905
He was just laying here
pretty much lifeless.

211
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:10,243
And this is right where...
where the bear...

212
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:13,443
I told them at the time, I said,
"This is the bear that killed Tim."

213
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:16,783
I knew, 'cause that was the same bear
that I had seen down here

214
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:20,757
looking at me right through
the alder bushes there.

215
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,727
So I knew this was the bear.
I said, "Yep, that'll be the one."

216
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:26,764
That wound up being the bear

217
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:30,267
that they found Tim in.

218
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:35,272
I'm here on camera with Olie, the big old bear.
The big old grumpy bear.

219
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:39,242
He just took Cracker
out of the creek area.

220
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:41,506
There's not a lot of fish here

221
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:44,310
so you can understand him wanting
to have control of the creek.

222
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:47,146
He's acting like
an alpha male here.

223
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:51,622
Which, I guess, for the fact that he is
the only male here, he is the alpha male.

224
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,818
At any rate, he's also...
He's a surly bear.

225
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:57,020
I met him on the path
the other day,

226
00:14:57,129 --> 00:15:01,293
after feeling sorry for him, thinking
that he was a bit thin, a bit gaunt...

227
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,461
And he promptly charged me
with the intent to probably strike.

228
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,766
I know the language
of the bear.

229
00:15:07,873 --> 00:15:11,536
I was able to deter him from doing that,
and I'm fine.

230
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:13,578
But I will tell you something.

231
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:17,979
It is the old bear, one who is struggling
for survival,

232
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:21,610
and an aggressive one at that,

233
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,086
who is the one
that you must be very careful of.

234
00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:27,158
For these are the bears,
that on occasion,

235
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:31,423
do, for survival,
kill and eat humans.

236
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:35,398
Could Olie, the big old bear,
possibly kill and eat Timothy Treadwell?

237
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:40,097
What do you think, Olie?
I think if you were weak around him,

238
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:43,766
you're going down his gullet,
going down the pipe.

239
00:15:45,544 --> 00:15:47,842
<i>Right up top of the hill here
is where we found</i>

240
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,882
<i>what was left of Tim's body...
his head and a little bit of backbone.</i>

241
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:53,679
And we found

242
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:57,313
a hand, arm,
wristwatch still on the arm.

243
00:15:57,423 --> 00:16:00,790
I remember the watch.
Shoot, I can remember the watch.

244
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:02,861
And here's a guy

245
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:06,659
that used to dive in the lake down here
naked to scare the airplanes away.

246
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:10,758
And here I'm finding his watch
and arm on top of the hill.

247
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:15,568
And here's about all that's left
of the bear that killed him.

248
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:18,939
A few pieces of rib bone.

249
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:22,480
This bear was shot,
and drug off and eaten

250
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:25,846
by other bears here,
right in this area.

251
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:30,388
The tough thing out of all this is Tim would
have never wanted to see any bears killed.

252
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:33,185
Even if they had killed him,
he would've...

253
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:36,750
He would've been happy
if nobody found him.

254
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:40,423
Nobody found any remains.
Nobody found his camp or anything.

255
00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:43,160
He would've been
perfectly content.

256
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:46,499
He definitely lived
on the edge. But he...

257
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,568
He was a little smarter than everyone
gave him credit for.

258
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:53,144
He made it out here a long time
before they caught up with him.

259
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:56,646
And actually the bear
that wound up killing him

260
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:59,684
was just a dirty rotten bear
that he didn't like anyway.

261
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:02,379
He wanted to be friends with,
but never happened.

262
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:07,248
I want to introduce you to one of the key
role players in this year's expedition.

263
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,190
The bear's name is The Grinch.

264
00:17:09,294 --> 00:17:11,956
The Grinch has come on
to be one of the more

265
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:15,693
<i>frequent bears
here in the Grizzly Maze.</i>

266
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:18,599
The Grinch is a female
of about five years of age.

267
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:21,036
Oh, hi, Grinch. Hi.

268
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,700
And she has kind of
an aggressive attitude.

269
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:25,504
Hi.

270
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:30,048
If I turn around too much, she'll bite me.
It's okay. Hi. How are you?

271
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:31,980
How are you?

272
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:39,249
Don't you do that.
Don't you do that!

273
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:42,389
Back off!

274
00:17:49,768 --> 00:17:51,736
Don't do it.

275
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:53,862
It's okay. I love you.

276
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:57,100
I love you. I love you.
I love you.

277
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:59,302
I love you. I'm sorry.

278
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:02,276
I'm Sam Egli.

279
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:05,009
I was called out as a helicopter pilot

280
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:10,749
to assist on the cleanup after
the Treadwell tragedy of last winter.

281
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:12,790
I was in there the morning

282
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:16,292
<i>the Fish and Game officers
were there examining</i>

283
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:20,957
<i>the bear that had done
the killing.</i>

284
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:22,829
<i>The bear was all cut open.</i>

285
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:27,338
It was full of people.
It was full of clothing. It was...

286
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:31,671
We hauled away
four garbage bags of people

287
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,540
out of that bear.

288
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:39,380
Treadwell was, I think,

289
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:41,612
meaning well, trying to do things

290
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:45,417
to help the resource of the bears.

291
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:49,551
But to me
he was acting like...

292
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:53,222
like he was working with people

293
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:57,393
wearing bear costumes out there
instead of wild animals.

294
00:18:58,737 --> 00:19:01,331
Those bears are big
and ferocious,

295
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,876
and they come equipped
to kill ya and eat ya.

296
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:09,107
And that's just what
Treadwell was asking for.

297
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:11,307
He got what
he was asking for.

298
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:14,510
He got what he deserved,
in my opinion.

299
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:19,080
The tragedy of it
was taking the girl with him.

300
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:22,493
I think the only reason

301
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:27,554
that Treadwell lasted
as long in the game as he did

302
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:32,694
was that the bears probably thought
there was something wrong with him.

303
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:36,968
Like he was mentally retarded
or something.

304
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:44,411
That bear, I think,
that day decided that he had

305
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:48,213
either had enough
of Tim Treadwell,

306
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,882
or that something clicked
in that bear's head

307
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:56,392
that he thought, "Hey, you know,
he might be good to eat."

308
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:00,398
<i>My opinion,
I think Treadwell thought</i>

309
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:04,435
<i>these bears were big,
scary looking, harmless creatures</i>

310
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:07,334
<i>that he could go up and pet
and sing to,</i>

311
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:10,203
<i>- and they would bond
- Look it there!</i>

312
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:13,972
<i>As children of the universe
or some odd.</i>

313
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:19,540
<i>I think he had lost sight
of what was really going on.</i>

314
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:35,062
<i>He wanted to become like the bear.</i>

315
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:38,603
Perhaps it was religious,
but not in the true sense of religion.

316
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:42,504
I think perhaps he wanted to

317
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:44,007
mutate into a wild animal

318
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:46,339
as he says in this last letter.

319
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:49,972
He says, "I have to mutually
mutate into a wild animal

320
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,209
to handle the life
I live out here."

321
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:55,252
I think there's
a religious sense in that

322
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:59,984
in the sense of connecting so deeply
that you're no longer human.

323
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,686
And that is a religious experience.

324
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:05,861
Here's another example.

325
00:21:05,964 --> 00:21:10,401
"There are many times that
I feel death is the best option.

326
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:13,699
My work would be
much more seriously looked at

327
00:21:13,805 --> 00:21:17,400
and possibly make the difference
that in living, I can't do."

328
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:20,808
I think that was
sort of a paradox for him.

329
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:25,406
That he felt not worthy enough
to get his message across at times.

330
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:28,008
And so, maybe,
in the drama of death

331
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,487
his message would be more poignant
and reach out to more people.

332
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:35,390
<i>But his message stirred
a lot of controversy.</i>

333
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:39,362
<i>The Gaedes have collected
thousands of angry letters.</i>

334
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:41,523
I can read you some of...

335
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:45,569
I picked out three
of these vitriolic hate mails.

336
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:48,640
They cover the gamut.

337
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:53,005
"Stereotypical environmentalist.

338
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:55,341
Just as long as the donations
keep coming,

339
00:21:55,447 --> 00:21:59,975
furthering the antihuman
eco-religion as a noble cause,

340
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:02,053
who cares about reality?"

341
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:05,317
And the very idea

342
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:09,326
that Timothy made a lot of money
doing what he did

343
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:13,455
is absolutely preposterous, 'cause
he's one of the poorest people we knew.

344
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:15,726
Another one.

345
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:19,736
"A bear diet consists
of liberals and Dems,"

346
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,362
meaning Democrats.

347
00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:25,239
"A bear diet consists of liberals and Dems
and wacko environmentalists

348
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:29,110
that think the spotted owl
is the most important thing in the world.

349
00:22:29,214 --> 00:22:33,378
We need to somehow drastically increase
the number of bears in America,

350
00:22:33,485 --> 00:22:37,751
especially in such key spots
as the Berkeley campus."

351
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:44,322
<i>I, too, would like to step in here
in his defense,</i>

352
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:48,229
<i>not as an ecologist,
but as a filmmaker.</i>

353
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:51,928
<i>He captured such glorious
improvised moments,</i>

354
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:54,198
<i>the likes of which
the studio directors,</i>

355
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:57,707
<i>with their union crews,
can never dream of.</i>

356
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,179
Okay.

357
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:11,978
What are you doing up there?
That's where you're sitting?

358
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:23,897
There. Go.

359
00:23:24,002 --> 00:23:28,564
Go! Go! Go!

360
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:31,906
Come on! Come on!

361
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:35,739
Come on! Run home!

362
00:23:46,191 --> 00:23:48,022
Come on!

363
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:10,778
Hi.

364
00:24:10,882 --> 00:24:13,180
Hey, you little champion.

365
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,480
Hi. How are you?

366
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:17,452
You're such a good champion.

367
00:24:17,556 --> 00:24:20,047
I love you. I love you.

368
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:23,684
Get up there,
and guard that tent.

369
00:24:32,103 --> 00:24:34,571
I'm here with one of my favorite bears.
It's Mr. Chocolate.

370
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:36,607
Hi, Mr. Chocolate.

371
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:40,337
He is the star of many people
across the country:

372
00:24:40,445 --> 00:24:42,436
Children, people, adults.

373
00:24:42,547 --> 00:24:44,412
<i>And we're here
in the Grizzly Sanctuary.</i>

374
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:47,144
<i>But I'm wrapping up my work
in the Grizzly Sanctuary. Why is that?</i>

375
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:49,117
<i>Because I'm on my way
to the Grizzly Maze</i>

376
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:53,590
where bears do not have human protection,
but are under human threat.

377
00:24:53,692 --> 00:24:57,822
Bears like Aunt Melissa. Bears like Demon,
Hatchet, Downey and Tabitha.

378
00:24:57,929 --> 00:24:59,863
And it's time for me
to go to protect them.

379
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:02,024
I wish I could bring
Mr. Chocolate with me.

380
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:04,033
You'd be great protection there.

381
00:25:04,135 --> 00:25:07,798
He's been with me for over a decade, and he's
been my good friend and I appreciate it.

382
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:10,431
Thank you, Mr. Chocolate.
I'll see you again next year.

383
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:14,000
No. I'll see him again at expedition...
end of this expedition.

384
00:25:14,112 --> 00:25:17,411
I'll be back here to join you again.
Back with Mr. Chocolate.

385
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:22,146
<i>But first, it's off to the exciting
and often dangerous Grizzly Maze.</i>

386
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:26,322
<i>Now the scene seems to be over.</i>

387
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:30,292
<i>But as a filmmaker,
sometimes things fall into your lap</i>

388
00:25:30,395 --> 00:25:32,955
<i>which you couldn't expect,
never even dream of.</i>

389
00:25:33,064 --> 00:25:34,793
Hi, Spirit.

390
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:38,563
<i>There is something like
an inexplicable magic of cinema.</i>

391
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:41,497
Hi, Spirit.

392
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:48,903
Well, I'm here with Mr. Chocolate
and Spirit, the fox.

393
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:51,881
And here comes
some of her pups. Yea!

394
00:25:51,983 --> 00:25:53,814
Here comes
some of her pups.

395
00:25:56,021 --> 00:25:57,784
Hi.

396
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:02,559
Hi, Spirit.

397
00:26:04,496 --> 00:26:06,293
Hi, Spirit. Hello, baby.

398
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,860
Coming down.

399
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:18,070
What are you doing to that hat?

400
00:26:18,176 --> 00:26:19,905
Where's that hat going?

401
00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:40,191
Hey, who's stealing that hat?

402
00:26:40,298 --> 00:26:43,961
Let me see that hat.
Ghost, I want that hat.

403
00:26:45,036 --> 00:26:47,698
Man! Ghost is bad.

404
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:51,305
Ghost, what are you doing
with that hat?

405
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:54,003
Ghost, that hat
is a very important hat.

406
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:56,808
Drop it! Hey!

407
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:00,509
Oh, goddamn it!

408
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:03,144
I can't believe this!

409
00:27:03,254 --> 00:27:05,119
Ghost!

410
00:27:05,223 --> 00:27:07,316
Ghost, where's that fucking hat?

411
00:27:07,425 --> 00:27:10,861
That hat is so frigging valuable
for this trip.

412
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:14,090
Ghost, you come back here
with that friggin' hat.

413
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:17,225
If it's in the den,
I'm gonna fucking explode.

414
00:27:17,335 --> 00:27:19,166
Ghost, where's that hat?

415
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:21,363
It's not okay for you to steal it.

416
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:24,806
Oh, man!

417
00:27:24,909 --> 00:27:26,274
Oh, man!

418
00:27:27,412 --> 00:27:29,642
It's a friggin' den.

419
00:27:29,914 --> 00:27:32,439
One of the things I've
heard about Mr. Treadwell,

420
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:34,643
and you can see
in a lot of his films,

421
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:37,654
is that he tended
to want to become a bear.

422
00:27:37,756 --> 00:27:41,556
Some people that I've spoken with would
encounter him in the field,

423
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,924
and he would act like a bear,
he would "woof" at them.

424
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:48,796
He would act in the same way a bear
would when they were surprised.

425
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:53,997
Why he did this is only known to him.
No one really knows for sure.

426
00:27:54,105 --> 00:27:56,369
But when you spend
a lot of time with bears,

427
00:27:56,474 --> 00:27:59,568
especially when you're in the field
with them day after day,

428
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:01,737
there's a siren song,
there's a calling

429
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:04,440
that makes you wanna come in
and spend more time in the world.

430
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:06,779
<i>Because it is a simpler world.</i>

431
00:28:06,885 --> 00:28:08,910
<i>It is a wonderful thing,</i>

432
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,079
<i>but in fact
it's a harsh world.</i>

433
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:14,022
<i>It's a different world that bears
live in than we do.</i>

434
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:16,958
<i>So there is that desire
to get into their world,</i>

435
00:28:17,062 --> 00:28:21,055
<i>but the reality is we never can because
we're very different than they are.</i>

436
00:28:39,851 --> 00:28:41,944
<i>The line between bear and human</i>

437
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:45,284
<i>has apparently always
been respected</i>

438
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,915
<i>by the native communities
of Alaska.</i>

439
00:28:48,026 --> 00:28:51,928
<i>We visited the curator
of Kodiak's Alutiiq Museum,</i>

440
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:57,593
<i>which had recently been raided
by tourists out of control.</i>

441
00:28:57,702 --> 00:29:01,229
Somebody wanted it so much,
they cut the paw off.

442
00:29:01,339 --> 00:29:03,705
They stole it from here.

443
00:29:03,808 --> 00:29:07,471
It was quite tragic for us
because it's on loan

444
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:11,106
and they came in and took it.

445
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:15,784
And how do you see
Timothy Treadwell's story?

446
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:18,981
I see it as something that's both...

447
00:29:20,225 --> 00:29:23,456
It's tragic because,

448
00:29:23,561 --> 00:29:25,756
yeah, he died
and his girlfriend died

449
00:29:25,864 --> 00:29:28,765
because he tried to be a bear.

450
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:32,826
He tried to act like a bear, and for us
on the island, you don't do that.

451
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:36,065
You don't invade
on their territory.

452
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:37,471
You...

453
00:29:37,575 --> 00:29:39,873
When you're in their territory,
you know you're there.

454
00:29:39,978 --> 00:29:42,776
And when you're nearby,

455
00:29:42,881 --> 00:29:45,748
you make sure that
they know you're around.

456
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:51,478
You know, for him to act
like a bear the way he did,

457
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:53,352
would be...

458
00:29:54,492 --> 00:29:56,392
I don't know.
To me, it was the ultimate

459
00:29:56,494 --> 00:29:59,952
of disrespecting the bear
and what the bear represents.

460
00:30:00,064 --> 00:30:03,625
But he tried to protect the bears,
didn't he?

461
00:30:05,503 --> 00:30:07,801
I think he did more damage
to the bears than he did...

462
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:12,502
Because when you habituate bears to
humans, they think all humans are safe.

463
00:30:13,711 --> 00:30:17,272
<i>Where I grew up, the bears avoid us
and we avoid them.</i>

464
00:30:17,382 --> 00:30:19,612
<i>They're not habituated to us.</i>

465
00:30:19,717 --> 00:30:23,050
<i>If I look at it from my culture,
Timothy Treadwell crossed a boundary</i>

466
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:26,646
<i>that we have lived with
for 7,000 years.</i>

467
00:30:26,758 --> 00:30:28,726
<i>It's an unspoken boundary,
an unknown boundary.</i>

468
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:31,557
<i>But when we know
we've crossed it,</i>

469
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:33,927
<i>we pay the price.</i>

470
00:31:08,499 --> 00:31:10,558
<i>Jewel, I apologize</i>

471
00:31:10,668 --> 00:31:14,968
that this wristwatch
is still in an evidence bag.

472
00:31:15,073 --> 00:31:18,975
However, I want you to have this watch.

473
00:31:19,077 --> 00:31:22,410
I think that it is important
that you have it.

474
00:31:23,781 --> 00:31:26,215
You knew Timothy for a long time.

475
00:31:26,317 --> 00:31:29,309
My understanding is that you lived together
for three years.

476
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,320
You were very close to him.

477
00:31:31,422 --> 00:31:33,652
Yeah. He was my boyfriend for three years.
He was my boss.

478
00:31:33,758 --> 00:31:37,285
He was a lot of things
to me in 20 years.

479
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:41,161
I understand that. And that's the reason
I want you to have this.

480
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:43,359
This really should be yours.

481
00:31:44,836 --> 00:31:46,963
- This watch is still running.
- Oh, wow.

482
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:51,269
It has been running continuously
since the time that I received it.

483
00:31:51,376 --> 00:31:54,607
This was taken off Timothy's wrist.

484
00:31:55,713 --> 00:31:58,807
Wow! There it is.

485
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:02,717
It's still running. I can't even believe it.
I can't believe it.

486
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,219
I'm gonna wear it.

487
00:32:04,322 --> 00:32:07,849
And I'm gonna remember him,
and I'm gonna remember Amie.

488
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:10,621
Can you speak about Amie?

489
00:32:12,163 --> 00:32:16,600
Amie was brave
and Amie was strong.

490
00:32:16,701 --> 00:32:19,636
Amie was my friend
and she was Timothy's friend.

491
00:32:19,737 --> 00:32:23,332
She was his girlfriend, but most important,
she was his friend.

492
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:24,931
And...

493
00:32:26,177 --> 00:32:31,114
And I believe that
I'm gonna honor their choice.

494
00:32:31,215 --> 00:32:35,049
I'm always gonna respect them for
what they did, and for how they did it.

495
00:32:35,153 --> 00:32:38,554
And for being out there,
and for protecting bears

496
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:41,090
and living in wild nature.

497
00:32:41,192 --> 00:32:44,389
And living their life to the fullest.

498
00:32:44,495 --> 00:32:47,862
They truly died
doing what they lived for.

499
00:32:49,834 --> 00:32:51,802
Representing Timothy.

500
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:55,871
And then I'll fill in the rest.
That's the specific number.

501
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,942
- So there it is.
- So there it is.

502
00:32:58,042 --> 00:33:01,205
Full circle. I've got it all.
I can't even believe it.

503
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:05,180
- Hopefully it will continue to run a long time.
- I think it will.

504
00:33:05,283 --> 00:33:06,750
Very good.

505
00:33:16,394 --> 00:33:18,294
It's the last thing that's left.

506
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:24,363
Thanks, Franc.

507
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:28,101
Jewel Palovak,

508
00:33:29,907 --> 00:33:32,899
you were very close
to Timothy Treadwell.

509
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:35,912
Do you sometimes
feel like his widow?

510
00:33:36,948 --> 00:33:39,041
Do I feel like his widow?

511
00:33:41,285 --> 00:33:43,810
Yeah, you know,
in some ways I do.

512
00:33:43,921 --> 00:33:46,981
I feel like his widow because

513
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:52,620
everything that he had,
everything that he worked for,

514
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:54,755
he left to me.

515
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:57,562
<i>I was his girlfriend.</i>

516
00:33:57,668 --> 00:34:00,296
<i>I was his employee.</i>

517
00:34:00,405 --> 00:34:05,468
<i>I was the person that figured
all the last-minute details out.</i>

518
00:34:05,576 --> 00:34:08,909
You also founded a foundation
with him?

519
00:34:09,013 --> 00:34:11,174
<i>Yeah. We did.
We founded Grizzly People,</i>

520
00:34:11,282 --> 00:34:15,275
whose mission is to protect
and preserve habitat worldwide.

521
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:21,652
<i>For Treadwell, who had
a natural tendency towards chaos,</i>

522
00:34:21,759 --> 00:34:25,490
<i>Grizzly People served
as his organized platform,</i>

523
00:34:25,596 --> 00:34:29,430
<i>and Jewel was his
most trusted co-combatant.</i>

524
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,733
<i>I met him in a restaurant.</i>

525
00:34:32,837 --> 00:34:35,362
<i>We both worked at this place
called Gulliver's.</i>

526
00:34:35,473 --> 00:34:38,442
<i>It was a prime rib restaurant.
It was huge and theatrical.</i>

527
00:34:38,543 --> 00:34:40,977
Timothy was a squire,
'cause it was set in the time...

528
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,309
<i>It was based
on Gulliver's Travels.</i>

529
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:46,406
<i>He had a chintzy felt hat</i>

530
00:34:46,517 --> 00:34:49,350
and a cheap plastic apron
and some knickers

531
00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:51,945
and that blond hair
just sticking out.

532
00:34:52,056 --> 00:34:55,617
And me, I would be your English
serving wench for the evening.

533
00:34:55,726 --> 00:34:58,217
You had to toss the salad
with aplomb,

534
00:34:58,329 --> 00:35:01,423
and you had to boil the soup
and serve it to the people.

535
00:35:01,532 --> 00:35:04,467
I had seen Timothy,
and he was kind of fun.

536
00:35:04,569 --> 00:35:06,560
I didn't really know who he was.

537
00:35:06,671 --> 00:35:08,662
And one night, I just wasn't
in the best of moods.

538
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:11,742
I had a huge table.
A family of people that wanted me

539
00:35:11,843 --> 00:35:14,903
to make it the best dining experience
of their life.

540
00:35:15,012 --> 00:35:18,743
Do it up big. Make the soup big, you know.
Use the vernacular.

541
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:23,150
There was grandmas and babies
and hairdos and coats.

542
00:35:23,254 --> 00:35:26,917
So I thought, "You know what? I'll make it.
I'll make it big for ya.

543
00:35:27,024 --> 00:35:30,585
I'll make it really big.
You'll never forget this birthday."

544
00:35:30,695 --> 00:35:33,687
So, one of the parts
was you'd take the soup cart,

545
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:37,290
and you'd light it up with this gas
so that the soup was bubbling and boiling.

546
00:35:37,401 --> 00:35:39,460
You could smell
the deliciousness.

547
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:42,232
And I decided to make it
really big.

548
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:45,832
So I trailed a little bit
extra of the lighter fluid

549
00:35:45,943 --> 00:35:47,911
around the polyester cloth,

550
00:35:48,012 --> 00:35:52,676
and I kind of miscalculated
because the soup exploded.

551
00:35:52,783 --> 00:35:56,014
The people screamed,
the fire went everywhere.

552
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:59,214
So I was called into the office
in the next couple of days.

553
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:02,622
And who do I see
when I sit down in the office,

554
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:06,288
waiting like you're in the jail or
you're in the principal's office?

555
00:36:06,397 --> 00:36:08,456
I see Timothy Treadwell.

556
00:36:08,566 --> 00:36:11,626
I was like, "Hey, How are you?
I know I've seen you. I'm Jewel."

557
00:36:11,736 --> 00:36:14,204
He said, "I'm Tim."
I said, "What are you in for?"

558
00:36:14,305 --> 00:36:17,001
He said, "I'm in for walking funny
in the dining room."

559
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:19,474
He said, "What did you do?"
I said, "I lit the soup cart on fire."

560
00:36:19,577 --> 00:36:23,274
He said, "That was you?"
And you know,

561
00:36:23,381 --> 00:36:27,044
it wasn't love at first sight,
but it was certainly kindred spirits.

562
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:32,322
Only Timmy is the boss
of all foxes and all bears.

563
00:36:32,423 --> 00:36:34,448
You're their ruler.

564
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:36,459
Look at that face.

565
00:36:37,762 --> 00:36:40,230
Hey, thanks for being my friend.

566
00:36:40,331 --> 00:36:43,732
This is so good.
Does that feel good?

567
00:36:45,169 --> 00:36:47,330
<i>We patrol the Grizzly Sanctuary together.
How did we meet?</i>

568
00:36:47,438 --> 00:36:50,601
Over a decade ago.
He left his mother and father's side,

569
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:54,235
promptly peed on my shoes,
pooped on my clothes, that was it.

570
00:36:54,345 --> 00:36:58,577
<i>He was my friend. Timmy, the fox. Yep.
And we watch over things.</i>

571
00:36:58,683 --> 00:37:01,447
<i>And he's the boss.
Takes care of everything.</i>

572
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:04,749
<i>Yep, yep. He says,
"I love the way you pet."</i>

573
00:37:04,855 --> 00:37:08,916
I think one of the things that's really important
is you can see the bond

574
00:37:09,026 --> 00:37:12,154
that has developed between
this very wild animal

575
00:37:12,263 --> 00:37:15,596
and this very,
fairly wild person.

576
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,691
<i>And you realize
he has this gorgeous fur,</i>

577
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:19,793
and people are trying
to kill him for it

578
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:22,873
with steel door traps
and cruel farming practices.

579
00:37:22,974 --> 00:37:25,636
And other people run him down
on horses for sport.

580
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:28,837
Fox hunting.
We want this to end.

581
00:37:28,946 --> 00:37:32,677
Between Timmy, the fox, this beautiful fox,
and me, we ask the public,

582
00:37:32,783 --> 00:37:38,085
please stop killing and hurting these foxes
and torturing them.

583
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:39,850
Don't you think?

584
00:37:39,957 --> 00:37:42,323
If they knew how beautiful he was,
and how sweet he was,

585
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:44,451
they would never hurt him.

586
00:37:44,562 --> 00:37:46,257
Thanks.

587
00:37:46,364 --> 00:37:50,596
<i>Timothy used his camera as a tool
to get his message across.</i>

588
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:53,261
<i>Sometimes it was very playful.</i>

589
00:37:53,371 --> 00:37:57,068
Do another take here. I fucked up the last
one. Almost fell off the cliff.

590
00:37:57,174 --> 00:38:00,109
I'm a fucking asshole.

591
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:02,441
<i>Behind me is the Grizzly Sanctuary
and also behind me,</i>

592
00:38:02,546 --> 00:38:06,676
hidden down below in those trees somewhere,
is my camp.

593
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:10,242
I must stay incognito.
I must hide from the authorities.

594
00:38:10,354 --> 00:38:12,754
I must hide from people
who would harm me.

595
00:38:12,857 --> 00:38:15,519
I must now hide from people
that seek me out

596
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:18,356
because I've made some sort of,

597
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:20,453
I don't want to say celebrity,

598
00:38:20,564 --> 00:38:23,362
but they come to Alaska
and hear about Treadwell in the bush

599
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:25,492
and they want to go find him.

600
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:27,901
Well, they can't.
I'm hidden down below.

601
00:38:28,005 --> 00:38:31,372
No one knows where I am.
Even I don't know where I am.

602
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:33,102
That's pretty shitty.

603
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:35,576
Let's do a really short take here.

604
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,615
<i>But as a filmmaker,
he was methodical.</i>

605
00:38:38,716 --> 00:38:41,549
<i>- Whatever.
- Often repeating takes 15 times.</i>

606
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:43,745
One more really short,
excellent take.

607
00:38:43,854 --> 00:38:48,848
Let's just really sum it up. Here we go.
This is gonna be the motherfucker.

608
00:38:48,959 --> 00:38:52,554
<i>Behind me is the Grizzly Sanctuary,
and also hidden below is my camp.</i>

609
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:56,895
For I must now remain hidden from the
authorities, from people who would harm me,

610
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:59,162
from people who would
seek me out as a story.

611
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:01,568
My future helping the animals
depends on it.

612
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:04,505
I must be a spirit
in the wilderness.

613
00:39:06,944 --> 00:39:09,674
<i>With himself as the central character,</i>

614
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:12,271
<i>he began to craft his own movie,</i>

615
00:39:12,383 --> 00:39:15,716
<i>something way beyond
the wildlife film.</i>

616
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:18,220
There is going to be a number of takes
I'm gonna do.

617
00:39:18,322 --> 00:39:20,222
These are called
"Wild Timmy Jungle Scenes."

618
00:39:20,324 --> 00:39:22,451
We're gonna do
several takes of each

619
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,927
where I'll do it with a bandanna on,
maybe a bandanna off.

620
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,998
Maybe two different
colored bandannas.

621
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:29,726
Some without a bandanna,

622
00:39:29,834 --> 00:39:32,564
some with the camera
being held.

623
00:39:35,172 --> 00:39:38,938
I kind of stumbled.
Let's do it again.

624
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:43,503
So the basic deal is that this stuff
could be cut into a show later on,

625
00:39:43,614 --> 00:39:48,551
but who knows what look I had, whether
I had the black bandanna or no bandanna.

626
00:39:48,652 --> 00:39:52,053
Very rarely the camo one,
but I like the camo look.

627
00:39:55,526 --> 00:39:59,053
Both cameras rolling. Both cameras rolling.
Both cameras rolling!

628
00:40:00,998 --> 00:40:04,058
Sexy green bandanna,
last take of the evening.

629
00:40:04,168 --> 00:40:06,102
I'm on my way to the creek.
I need to get water.

630
00:40:06,203 --> 00:40:10,503
And there's a super-duper low tide.
Full moon tonight, and action.

631
00:40:10,608 --> 00:40:12,667
<i>In his action movie mode,</i>

632
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:15,109
<i>Treadwell probably did not realize</i>

633
00:40:15,212 --> 00:40:20,616
<i>that seemingly empty moments
had a strange, secret beauty.</i>

634
00:40:20,718 --> 00:40:24,586
<i>Sometimes images themselves
developed their own life,</i>

635
00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:27,657
<i>their own mysterious stardom.</i>

636
00:40:39,703 --> 00:40:41,500
Starsky and Hutch. Over.

637
00:40:45,509 --> 00:40:47,409
<i>Beyond his posings,</i>

638
00:40:47,511 --> 00:40:51,174
<i>the camera was his only
present companion.</i>

639
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:55,150
<i>It was his instrument to explore
the wilderness around him,</i>

640
00:40:55,252 --> 00:40:59,154
<i>but increasingly
it became something more.</i>

641
00:40:59,256 --> 00:41:02,521
<i>He started to scrutinize
his innermost being,</i>

642
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:06,153
<i>his demons,
his exhilarations.</i>

643
00:41:06,263 --> 00:41:11,200
<i>Facing the lens of a camera took
on the quality of a confessional.</i>

644
00:41:14,371 --> 00:41:16,430
<i>Covering various years,</i>

645
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:20,306
<i>the following samples illustrate
the search for himself.</i>

646
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:23,947
If there... I have no idea
if there's a God.

647
00:41:24,048 --> 00:41:27,245
But if there's a God, God would
be very, very... pleased with me.

648
00:41:27,351 --> 00:41:29,546
If he could just watch me here,
how much I love them,

649
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:33,350
how much I adore them,
how respectful I am to them.

650
00:41:33,457 --> 00:41:35,357
How I am one of them.

651
00:41:35,459 --> 00:41:39,054
And how the studies they give me,
the photographs, the video...

652
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:41,825
And take that around
for no charge

653
00:41:41,932 --> 00:41:44,594
to people around the world.

654
00:41:44,702 --> 00:41:48,103
It's good work. I feel good about it.
I feel good about myself doing it.

655
00:41:48,205 --> 00:41:52,642
And I want to continue, and I hope I can.
I really hope I can.

656
00:41:52,743 --> 00:41:55,803
But if not, be warned.

657
00:41:55,913 --> 00:41:59,872
I will die for these animals. I will die for
these animals. I will die for these animals.

658
00:41:59,984 --> 00:42:02,282
Thank you so much
for letting me do this.

659
00:42:02,386 --> 00:42:06,482
Thank you so much for these animals,
for giving me a life.

660
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:10,458
I had no life.
Now I have a life.

661
00:42:17,968 --> 00:42:19,936
Now, enough of that.

662
00:42:21,572 --> 00:42:24,370
Now let the expedition continue.
It's off to Timmy, the fox.

663
00:42:24,475 --> 00:42:26,773
We've gotta find Banjo.
He's missing!

664
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:29,243
And that's my story here,

665
00:42:29,346 --> 00:42:31,940
for me, Timothy Treadwell,

666
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:34,244
the kind warrior.

667
00:42:34,351 --> 00:42:36,819
Can I take it?

668
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:38,786
I'm trying.

669
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:41,016
Okay, yeah, I can do it.

670
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:43,559
Yeah. Why not? Why not?

671
00:42:44,628 --> 00:42:46,960
I've crossed the halfway point.

672
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:50,795
Government's given me
all they have. So far.

673
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:53,199
I've stood up to it.

674
00:42:53,304 --> 00:42:56,762
I've had danger in the boat, almost died.
I've almost fallen off a cliff.

675
00:42:56,874 --> 00:43:00,310
<i>Yeah. The danger factor's
about to amp up in the Maze.</i>

676
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:02,845
<i>The Maze is always
the most dangerous.</i>

677
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:06,541
Lord, I do not want
to be hurt by a bear.

678
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:08,481
I do not.

679
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:12,613
I always cannot understand why girls
don't wanna be with me for a long time,

680
00:43:12,723 --> 00:43:15,089
because I have really
a nice personality.

681
00:43:15,192 --> 00:43:17,126
I'm fun.

682
00:43:17,227 --> 00:43:20,719
I'm very, very good in the... You're not
supposed to say that when you're a guy.

683
00:43:20,831 --> 00:43:23,265
But I know I am.
They know I am.

684
00:43:23,367 --> 00:43:25,528
And...

685
00:43:28,505 --> 00:43:31,531
I don't fight with them,
I'm so passive.

686
00:43:31,642 --> 00:43:33,542
Bit of a patsy!

687
00:43:33,644 --> 00:43:36,374
Is that a turnoff to girls,
to be a patsy?

688
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:40,280
I mean it's not... it's not
that I'm a total great guy.

689
00:43:40,384 --> 00:43:43,410
I'm a lot of fun
and have a good life going.

690
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,216
I don't know what's going on.

691
00:43:46,323 --> 00:43:49,190
I always wished I was gay.
Would've been a lot easier.

692
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:51,284
You know?
You can just "bing-bing-bing."

693
00:43:51,395 --> 00:43:55,297
Gay guys have no problem. I mean,
they go to restrooms and truck stops,

694
00:43:55,399 --> 00:43:57,959
and they perform sex.

695
00:43:58,068 --> 00:44:00,662
It's like so easy for 'em and stuff.

696
00:44:00,771 --> 00:44:04,969
But you know what?
Alas, Timothy Treadwell is not gay. Bummer!

697
00:44:05,075 --> 00:44:08,408
I love girls! And girls...

698
00:44:08,512 --> 00:44:10,810
Girls need a lot more...

699
00:44:10,914 --> 00:44:13,815
need a lot more, you know,

700
00:44:13,917 --> 00:44:18,752
finesse and care,
and I like that a bit.

701
00:44:18,856 --> 00:44:21,222
But when it goes bad
and you're alone,

702
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:22,883
it's like...

703
00:44:23,927 --> 00:44:25,189
Well,

704
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:30,027
you know, you can't rebound
like you can if you were gay.

705
00:44:30,134 --> 00:44:32,068
I'm sure gay people
have problems too,

706
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:36,162
but not as much as one goofy straight guy
named Timothy Treadwell.

707
00:44:36,273 --> 00:44:39,674
Anyway, that's my story.
That's my story.

708
00:44:41,412 --> 00:44:44,609
I love you. Look at you.

709
00:44:44,715 --> 00:44:47,275
You're the best little fox.

710
00:44:47,384 --> 00:44:49,818
But how did I come
into this work, Iris?

711
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,785
Did you ever get the story?

712
00:44:51,889 --> 00:44:55,586
I was troubled. I was troubled.
I drank a lot.

713
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:57,957
Did you know that?
You wouldn't even know what that is.

714
00:44:58,062 --> 00:45:02,465
But I used to drink
to the point of

715
00:45:02,566 --> 00:45:07,265
that I guess I was either gonna die
from it or break free of it.

716
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:11,307
But nothing, nothing, Iris,
could get me from... to stop drinking.

717
00:45:11,408 --> 00:45:15,003
Nothing! I went to programs.
I tried quitting myself.

718
00:45:15,112 --> 00:45:18,946
I did everything that I could
to try not to drink,

719
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:21,517
and then I did everything
I could to drink.

720
00:45:21,618 --> 00:45:24,018
And... And it was killing me

721
00:45:24,121 --> 00:45:27,113
until I discovered
this land of bears

722
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:30,557
<i>and realized that they were in
such great danger</i>

723
00:45:30,661 --> 00:45:34,062
<i>that they needed a caretaker, they needed
someone to look after them.</i>

724
00:45:34,164 --> 00:45:36,325
<i>But not a drunk person.
Not a person messed up.</i>

725
00:45:36,433 --> 00:45:40,802
<i>So I promised the bears
that if I would look over them,</i>

726
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:45,773
<i>would they please help me
be a better person and</i>

727
00:45:45,876 --> 00:45:48,709
they've become so inspirational,

728
00:45:48,812 --> 00:45:51,576
and living with the foxes too,

729
00:45:51,682 --> 00:45:53,616
that I did, I gave up the drinking.

730
00:45:53,717 --> 00:45:55,617
It was a miracle.
It was an absolute miracle.

731
00:45:55,719 --> 00:45:59,280
And the miracle was animals.
The miracle was animals.

732
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:07,052
I live here. It's very dangerous.
It's really dangerous.

733
00:46:07,164 --> 00:46:09,997
I run wild with the bears.
I run so wild, so free,

734
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:14,059
so like a child
with these animals.

735
00:46:14,171 --> 00:46:18,335
It's really cool.
And it's very serious.

736
00:46:19,676 --> 00:46:22,008
<i>I'm here alone,
and when you're all alone</i>

737
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:24,842
<i>you do get... you get lonely.</i>

738
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:27,815
<i>Oh, duhl Right?
You get pretty lonely.</i>

739
00:46:32,923 --> 00:46:36,723
Oh, no. I'm gonna do all this stuff because
I'm supposed to be alone.

740
00:46:36,827 --> 00:46:38,158
Oh. Okay.

741
00:46:40,531 --> 00:46:42,522
<i>Part of the mythical character</i>

742
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:45,067
<i>Treadwell was transforming
himself into</i>

743
00:46:45,169 --> 00:46:49,833
<i>required him to be seen
as being completely alone.</i>

744
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:53,467
<i>He was mostly alone,
but he did spend time with women</i>

745
00:46:53,577 --> 00:46:56,375
<i>who will here
remain anonymous.</i>

746
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,846
<i>The truth is that
Amie Huguenard</i>

747
00:46:58,949 --> 00:47:02,146
<i>accompanied him for parts
of his last two summers.</i>

748
00:47:02,252 --> 00:47:05,881
<i>A fact which was out of step
with his stylization</i>

749
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:08,981
<i>as the lone guardian
of the grizzlies.</i>

750
00:47:11,595 --> 00:47:16,328
<i>It's July 26, and I've been dropped off
all alone again here in the Grizzly Maze.</i>

751
00:47:16,433 --> 00:47:19,527
And it's always such a surreal
feeling as the plane takes off.

752
00:47:19,636 --> 00:47:23,595
And it doesn't quite sink
into you just how alone you are.

753
00:47:23,707 --> 00:47:25,698
That for the next
two months or more

754
00:47:25,809 --> 00:47:28,175
you will be alone
in this wild wilderness,

755
00:47:28,278 --> 00:47:32,078
this jungle that the bears
have carved tunnels through.

756
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:34,275
<i>And that's the Grizzly Maze.</i>

757
00:47:34,384 --> 00:47:36,818
It's July 26.
I hope to survive

758
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:39,650
and to be able to record
the secret world of the bears.

759
00:47:39,756 --> 00:47:43,214
And come September when people
might come to harm these animals,

760
00:47:43,327 --> 00:47:46,125
I'll look after them,
I'll make sure they're safe.

761
00:47:51,268 --> 00:47:54,795
It is so weird, though,
when it sinks in,

762
00:47:54,905 --> 00:47:57,339
how alone you are.

763
00:48:01,812 --> 00:48:06,875
<i>Amie Huguenard remains
a great unknown of this film.</i>

764
00:48:06,984 --> 00:48:09,953
<i>Her family declined
to appear on camera,</i>

765
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:13,989
<i>and Amie herself remains hidden
in Treadwell's footage.</i>

766
00:48:14,091 --> 00:48:16,992
<i>In nearly 100 hours
of his video,</i>

767
00:48:17,094 --> 00:48:20,427
<i>she appears
exactly two times.</i>

768
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:25,627
<i>Here disembarking from the plane
in the year of her death.</i>

769
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:27,499
<i>We never see her face.</i>

770
00:48:27,604 --> 00:48:31,335
<i>Here it is obscured
by her hands and her hair.</i>

771
00:48:31,441 --> 00:48:33,932
Greetings, children of America.

772
00:48:36,113 --> 00:48:40,015
<i>The second shot that we have
doesn't show her face either.</i>

773
00:48:40,117 --> 00:48:43,609
<i>She remains a mystery,
veiled by a mosquito net,</i>

774
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,688
<i>obscured, unknown.</i>

775
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:49,749
<i>Only through Treadwell's diaries</i>

776
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:52,988
<i>do we know that
she was frightened of bears.</i>

777
00:48:58,568 --> 00:49:01,401
<i>The only other hint
we have of her presence</i>

778
00:49:01,505 --> 00:49:03,871
<i>is this shot here of Treadwell.</i>

779
00:49:03,974 --> 00:49:06,807
<i>It is handheld,
and we can only deduct</i>

780
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:10,311
<i>it must have been Amie
operating the camera.</i>

781
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:22,824
Timothy Treadwell
and Amie Huguenard's remains

782
00:49:22,926 --> 00:49:25,224
came in this large metal can.

783
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:30,125
Inside this metal can
was a plastic bag,

784
00:49:30,233 --> 00:49:32,793
one for Timothy, and one for Amie.

785
00:49:32,903 --> 00:49:37,237
I mean, these are human beings.
And the question I ask is first of all:

786
00:49:37,341 --> 00:49:39,309
Who are you, Timothy?

787
00:49:39,409 --> 00:49:42,708
Who are you, Amie?
And what happened to you?

788
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:47,341
In the case of Timothy and Amie,
what I had were body parts.

789
00:49:47,451 --> 00:49:50,852
Just the visual input of seeing

790
00:49:50,954 --> 00:49:54,355
a detached human being
before my eyes

791
00:49:54,458 --> 00:49:58,485
makes my heart race, makes
the hair stand up on the back of my head.

792
00:49:58,595 --> 00:50:02,292
Particularly in combination
with the contents of a tape,

793
00:50:02,399 --> 00:50:06,631
an audiotape that is the sound portion
of the videotape.

794
00:50:06,737 --> 00:50:09,604
And when I find out
from other investigators

795
00:50:09,706 --> 00:50:13,506
that the shoes neatly placed
at the entrance to a tent,

796
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:16,408
and the cap left
on a camera so that

797
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:19,505
the visual part
could not be recorded,

798
00:50:19,616 --> 00:50:24,553
yet the tape is running so that we can
hear the sounds of Amie screaming

799
00:50:24,654 --> 00:50:28,454
and the sounds
of Timothy moaning,

800
00:50:28,558 --> 00:50:31,391
tells me that this event
occurred very, very quickly,

801
00:50:31,495 --> 00:50:33,520
suddenly and unexpectedly.

802
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:38,693
I clearly can hear her screaming,
"Stop" and "Go away."

803
00:50:38,802 --> 00:50:42,294
Maybe "Run away."
There's a lot of background noise.

804
00:50:42,406 --> 00:50:43,964
Timothy is moaning.

805
00:50:44,074 --> 00:50:49,410
And I hear Amie beating on the top
of this bear's head with a frying pan.

806
00:50:49,513 --> 00:50:53,711
And Timothy is saying,
"Run away. Let go!

807
00:50:53,817 --> 00:50:58,584
Run away. Run away, Amie.
Run away."

808
00:50:58,688 --> 00:51:01,885
Amie had a great deal
of conviction.

809
00:51:01,992 --> 00:51:06,326
She had a great deal of conviction
in this relationship. We know that.

810
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:09,922
Although in the past,
she was more standoffish.

811
00:51:10,033 --> 00:51:13,696
She didn't get as close
to the bear as Timothy did.

812
00:51:13,804 --> 00:51:16,329
She was more cautious.

813
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:19,898
However, I know,
that at the moment of death,

814
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:25,209
when one is being tried
to the maximum of one's ability

815
00:51:25,315 --> 00:51:29,752
to be faithful,
to stick to a situation,

816
00:51:29,853 --> 00:51:32,981
to be loyal, if one can say that,
to Timothy,

817
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:36,526
she stayed there,
and she fought with Timothy.

818
00:51:36,626 --> 00:51:38,685
She did not run away.

819
00:51:38,795 --> 00:51:43,129
Amie, we know, fought back
for approximately six minutes.

820
00:51:43,233 --> 00:51:48,261
Amie stayed with her lover,

821
00:51:48,371 --> 00:51:51,499
with her partner, with her mate,

822
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:53,542
and with the bear.

823
00:51:53,643 --> 00:51:58,842
Ultimately she stayed
with the bear in the situation.

824
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:17,532
<i>This is Timothy's camera.</i>

825
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:19,431
<i>During the fatal attack,</i>

826
00:52:19,536 --> 00:52:22,733
<i>there was no time
to remove the lens cap.</i>

827
00:52:22,839 --> 00:52:26,866
<i>Jewel Palovak allowed me
to listen to the audio.</i>

828
00:52:31,548 --> 00:52:33,778
I hear rain, and I hear Amie,

829
00:52:33,884 --> 00:52:37,047
"Get away! Get away!
Go away!"

830
00:52:59,075 --> 00:53:01,100
Can you turn it off?

831
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:22,490
Jewel, you must never
listen to this.

832
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:26,865
I know, Werner.
I'm never going to.

833
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:30,770
And you must never look at the photos
I've seen at the coroner's office.

834
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:33,900
- I will never look at them.
- Yeah.

835
00:53:39,516 --> 00:53:42,485
They said it was bad.

836
00:53:45,188 --> 00:53:48,783
Now you know why
no one's gonna hear it.

837
00:53:53,663 --> 00:53:57,224
I think you, you should not keep it.
You should destroy it.

838
00:53:57,334 --> 00:54:00,462
- Yeah.
- I think that's what you should do.

839
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:01,594
Okay.

840
00:54:01,705 --> 00:54:05,607
Because it will be the white elephant
in your room all your life.

841
00:57:05,388 --> 00:57:07,322
Here I am at the scene
of the fight.

842
00:57:07,424 --> 00:57:10,086
It looks as if tractors tore
the land up,

843
00:57:10,193 --> 00:57:12,388
raked it, rototilled it,
tossed it about.

844
00:57:12,495 --> 00:57:15,794
There is fur everywhere, and in the camera
foreground excreted waste.

845
00:57:15,899 --> 00:57:18,834
In the middle of the fight
so violent, so upsetting

846
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:22,200
that Sergeant Brown
went to the bathroom,

847
00:57:22,305 --> 00:57:25,832
did a number two during his fight.

848
00:57:25,942 --> 00:57:29,537
Extremely emotional,
extremely powerful.

849
00:57:29,646 --> 00:57:32,513
And yet, both bears
back in pursuit of Saturn,

850
00:57:32,615 --> 00:57:36,608
including Mickey, who appears
to have gotten the worse for the wear

851
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:39,847
in the fight between
Sergeant Brown and Mickey

852
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:44,325
<i>for the right to court Saturn,
the queen of the Grizzly Sanctuary.</i>

853
00:57:44,427 --> 00:57:46,486
<i>Amazing.</i>

854
00:57:46,596 --> 00:57:49,588
Oh, Mickey, I love you. And Mickey's
now the closest bear to Saturn.

855
00:57:49,699 --> 00:57:53,157
Back in like a horse in a race
that does not give up.

856
00:57:53,269 --> 00:57:56,238
We love that bear. Mickey!
We love him! We love him.

857
00:57:56,339 --> 00:57:59,433
But, Mickey,
I've been down that street.

858
00:57:59,542 --> 00:58:01,806
You don't always get the chick you want.
Let me tell you.

859
00:58:01,911 --> 00:58:04,379
It doesn't always often work out.

860
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:06,381
Hey, he's after my own heart.

861
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:09,281
He don't give up,
even when it looks shitty.

862
00:58:09,385 --> 00:58:12,320
All right, love you, Mickey.
Love you, Mickey.

863
00:58:19,262 --> 00:58:22,459
I just wanna discuss that fight
with Mickey bear right here.

864
00:58:22,565 --> 00:58:24,931
<i>He's right next to me here
in the Grizzly Sanctuary on the tide fly.</i>

865
00:58:25,034 --> 00:58:27,229
Saturn off to camera left.

866
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:32,502
Mick, you underestimated Sergeant Brown.
You went in for the head.

867
00:58:32,609 --> 00:58:35,305
He seemed to be rope-a-doping you
like he wasn't that tough.

868
00:58:35,411 --> 00:58:38,107
And then once you
banged into him,

869
00:58:38,214 --> 00:58:41,411
man, he turned out to be
one heck of a rough bear,

870
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:43,213
a very rough bear.

871
00:58:43,319 --> 00:58:47,016
I was so scared, I almost got sick
to my stomach watching you fight.

872
00:58:47,123 --> 00:58:49,921
Then when he knocked you down
and you were down on your back,

873
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:53,325
it was terrible,
it was terrible!

874
00:58:53,429 --> 00:58:55,693
I'm not duking it out for any girl like that.
I'm telling you right now.

875
00:58:55,798 --> 00:58:58,892
I'm not duking it out
for any girl, but l...

876
00:58:59,002 --> 00:59:01,493
Well, I've had my troubles
with the girls. Yeah, yeah.

877
00:59:01,604 --> 00:59:04,198
And I'll tell you something.
If Saturn was a female human...

878
00:59:04,307 --> 00:59:07,401
I can just see how beautiful
she is as a bear.

879
00:59:07,510 --> 00:59:11,344
I've always called her the Michelle Pfeiffer
of bears out here.

880
00:59:13,082 --> 00:59:15,448
All right, you lay there.
I'm gonna go off with your girlfriend.

881
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:17,452
Don't beat me up over it.

882
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:20,614
I'm cool, I'm cool. I'm respectful.

883
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:22,953
Things are bad for me
with the human women,

884
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:25,254
but not so bad that I have
to be hitting on bears yet.

885
00:59:25,361 --> 00:59:27,454
Okay? Okay.

886
00:59:30,767 --> 00:59:32,394
<i>In his diaries,</i>

887
00:59:32,502 --> 00:59:37,064
<i>Treadwell speaks often of the human world
as something foreign.</i>

888
00:59:37,173 --> 00:59:41,269
<i>He made a clear distinction between
the bears and the people's world</i>

889
00:59:41,377 --> 00:59:44,710
<i>which moved further and further
into the distance.</i>

890
00:59:46,549 --> 00:59:51,486
<i>Wild, primordial nature was
where he felt truly at home.</i>

891
00:59:55,792 --> 01:00:00,957
<i>We explored the glacier in the back country
of his Grizzly Sanctuary.</i>

892
01:00:01,064 --> 01:00:05,228
<i>This gigantic complexity
of tumbling ice and abysses</i>

893
01:00:05,335 --> 01:00:08,668
<i>separated Treadwell
from the world out there.</i>

894
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:13,470
<i>And more so, it seems to me
that this landscape in turmoil</i>

895
01:00:13,576 --> 01:00:16,067
<i>is a metaphor of his soul.</i>

896
01:00:27,357 --> 01:00:31,225
<i>Off there in the distance
is his bay and his campsite</i>

897
01:00:31,327 --> 01:00:33,727
<i>where he battled his demons.</i>

898
01:00:35,965 --> 01:00:38,832
<i>What drove Timothy
into the wild?</i>

899
01:00:39,102 --> 01:00:42,401
<i>We visited his parents
in Florida.</i>

900
01:00:44,907 --> 01:00:48,035
<i>Timothy grew up with
four siblings in Long Island</i>

901
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:50,203
<i>in a solid middle-class family</i>

902
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:54,010
<i>where the father worked as the foreman
of a construction team</i>

903
01:00:54,117 --> 01:00:56,847
<i>for a telephone company.</i>

904
01:00:56,953 --> 01:00:59,421
<i>There must have been
an urge to escape</i>

905
01:00:59,522 --> 01:01:03,856
<i>the safety of
his protected environment.</i>

906
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:08,294
<i>I was moved to find that among
all memorabilia in the house,</i>

907
01:01:08,398 --> 01:01:11,799
<i>his mother was clutching
Timothy's favorite bear.</i>

908
01:01:11,901 --> 01:01:15,462
This has been to Alaska
many times.

909
01:01:15,571 --> 01:01:18,301
I'm sure he loved it
to the end, you know?

910
01:01:18,408 --> 01:01:22,344
It's just... his childhood toy.

911
01:01:22,445 --> 01:01:27,041
<i>Tim's childhood pointed towards
nothing extraordinary.</i>

912
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:29,641
A normal everyday kid.

913
01:01:29,752 --> 01:01:34,052
Never any trouble in school.
Always a good student.

914
01:01:34,157 --> 01:01:36,489
Not an "A" student,
a "B" student.

915
01:01:36,592 --> 01:01:41,029
And got along great
with kids and animals.

916
01:01:41,130 --> 01:01:44,190
<i>Him and I were extremely connected
to animals in the house.</i>

917
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:46,996
<i>I think more so
than anybody else.</i>

918
01:01:48,404 --> 01:01:50,702
<i>This squirrel named Willie</i>

919
01:01:50,807 --> 01:01:53,708
<i>became Timothy's best friend.</i>

920
01:01:53,810 --> 01:01:56,938
<i>Teddy bears meant a lot to him.</i>

921
01:01:57,046 --> 01:02:02,279
<i>He seemed to develop into
an all-American boy, handsome,</i>

922
01:02:02,418 --> 01:02:05,581
<i>athletic, full of promise.</i>

923
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:11,220
<i>He excelled on
his high school swim team.</i>

924
01:02:11,327 --> 01:02:16,287
<i>He went to Bradley University
on a diving scholarship.</i>

925
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:20,130
I think he started drinking
out there and having,

926
01:02:20,236 --> 01:02:22,568
you know, just hanging out
with the wrong people.

927
01:02:22,672 --> 01:02:25,140
Then he injured his back.
And he ended up

928
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:28,836
losing his scholarship
and coming back home.

929
01:02:28,945 --> 01:02:32,312
He did attempt to smoke
marijuana in the house.

930
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:34,406
Yeah, he did.

931
01:02:34,517 --> 01:02:36,280
But I put the kibosh on that.

932
01:02:36,385 --> 01:02:39,047
But obviously he was
doing it elsewhere, so...

933
01:02:39,155 --> 01:02:43,091
He really wanted a new start,
a fresh start.

934
01:02:43,192 --> 01:02:47,492
So when he went out to California,
he was 19 or 20.

935
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:51,863
He wasn't a young 15 or 16-year-old.
He was of age.

936
01:02:51,968 --> 01:02:57,235
He'd gotten a job just to make money
on the Queen Mary at the gift shop.

937
01:02:57,340 --> 01:03:00,070
He did hire an agent.

938
01:03:00,176 --> 01:03:05,478
He did change his name
to Treadwell to be theatrical.

939
01:03:05,581 --> 01:03:08,175
And it was a family name.

940
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:13,279
I know he got on

941
01:03:13,389 --> 01:03:15,482
<i>Love Connection
with Chuck Woolery.</i>

942
01:03:15,591 --> 01:03:18,992
I think he got on another show.

943
01:03:19,095 --> 01:03:22,428
There were promises made
that never came true.

944
01:03:22,532 --> 01:03:25,023
And he tested with the actors

945
01:03:25,134 --> 01:03:28,797
<i>to get the bartender job
on Cheers.</i>

946
01:03:28,905 --> 01:03:33,433
And allegedly he came in second
to Woody Harrelson.

947
01:03:33,543 --> 01:03:36,137
How close a second?
I don't know.

948
01:03:36,245 --> 01:03:39,214
But that is what
really destroyed him.

949
01:03:39,315 --> 01:03:42,910
<i>That he did not get
that job on Cheers.</i>

950
01:03:45,087 --> 01:03:47,419
He spiraled down.

951
01:03:51,127 --> 01:03:53,925
Timmy used to body surf out here.

952
01:03:54,030 --> 01:03:58,467
He had a boogie board
with the Union Jack on it.

953
01:03:58,568 --> 01:04:02,436
And he was totally fearless.

954
01:04:02,538 --> 01:04:05,735
<i>The amazing thing about Timmy
was he did...</i>

955
01:04:05,842 --> 01:04:08,402
He had this Prince Valiant haircut.

956
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:12,311
And he could surf
and go under water,

957
01:04:12,415 --> 01:04:16,784
and yet still that hair would hide
his receding hairline.

958
01:04:16,886 --> 01:04:19,150
<i>It was the most
amazing thing I'd ever seen.</i>

959
01:04:19,255 --> 01:04:21,416
No matter how rough the surf,

960
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:23,685
you never saw Timmy's forehead.

961
01:04:23,793 --> 01:04:25,852
I don't know how he did that.

962
01:04:27,430 --> 01:04:29,159
How's the hair look?

963
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:32,759
<i>At some point in Timmy's life,</i>

964
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:35,463
he had a near fatal overdose.

965
01:04:35,571 --> 01:04:38,472
How he survived it,
I don't know.

966
01:04:38,574 --> 01:04:40,565
He was a tough guy.

967
01:04:40,676 --> 01:04:42,940
But I guess it was
an epiphany for him.

968
01:04:43,045 --> 01:04:47,539
After that he was looking
for a different persona.

969
01:04:49,619 --> 01:04:52,554
I guess that's when
he came up with

970
01:04:52,655 --> 01:04:56,091
where he was from
and his delightful accent.

971
01:04:56,192 --> 01:04:57,921
<i>I never questioned it.</i>

972
01:04:58,928 --> 01:05:02,125
<i>Treadwell's need to invent
a new persona for himself</i>

973
01:05:02,231 --> 01:05:04,995
<i>led him to elaborate
fabrications.</i>

974
01:05:05,101 --> 01:05:07,797
<i>He claimed to be an orphan
from Australia,</i>

975
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:12,136
<i>and even checked out details
of a small town in the Australian outback</i>

976
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:15,074
<i>in order to sound convincing.</i>

977
01:05:15,177 --> 01:05:18,669
<i>His accent, though,
remained suspicious.</i>

978
01:05:18,781 --> 01:05:22,512
<i>It almost sounded more Kennedy-esque
than Australian.</i>

979
01:05:22,618 --> 01:05:25,348
After Timmy's death,

980
01:05:25,454 --> 01:05:30,858
people said, "Well, don't you feel
betrayed that he did that?

981
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:34,760
That he didn't tell you the truth
about his accent or his origins?"

982
01:05:35,998 --> 01:05:37,932
And that never bothered me.

983
01:05:38,034 --> 01:05:40,366
Timmy always amused me.

984
01:05:40,469 --> 01:05:42,403
There's an old saying
on the farm,

985
01:05:42,505 --> 01:05:45,633
"If it doesn't scare the cows,
who cares?"

986
01:05:45,741 --> 01:05:49,006
Well, I don't think
Timmy ever scared the cows,

987
01:05:49,111 --> 01:05:51,102
so who cares?

988
01:05:51,213 --> 01:05:54,944
He was troubled.
I mean, it...

989
01:05:56,819 --> 01:05:59,344
One time he went to a doctor.

990
01:05:59,455 --> 01:06:02,947
They wanted to put him on some kind
of an antidepressant or something

991
01:06:03,059 --> 01:06:06,961
to keep his mood, 'cause his moods
were so up and down.

992
01:06:07,063 --> 01:06:10,999
And he started taking it for a while,
and then he stopped.

993
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:13,159
He said, "I had to stop."
I said, "Why?"

994
01:06:13,269 --> 01:06:18,138
He said, "Because I can't stop.
I can't have the middle grounds.

995
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:20,470
I have to have the highs
and the lows.

996
01:06:20,576 --> 01:06:22,976
It's a part of my life,
it's a part of my personality."

997
01:06:23,079 --> 01:06:25,343
He definitely had a dark side.

998
01:06:25,448 --> 01:06:30,647
He was mixed up in drugs which makes you
mixed up in bad people, people with guns.

999
01:06:30,753 --> 01:06:35,315
Timothy always had a sense of justice
that was his own.

1000
01:06:35,424 --> 01:06:39,622
So he got into a lot,
a lot of trouble.

1001
01:06:39,729 --> 01:06:41,629
I think that...

1002
01:06:41,731 --> 01:06:43,631
How dangerous?

1003
01:06:43,733 --> 01:06:45,530
How dangerous? I mean...

1004
01:06:47,570 --> 01:06:50,266
I don't think he would've ever...
He couldn't have ever killed anybody.

1005
01:06:50,373 --> 01:06:53,399
He always kept it in check. One thing
that we did every once in a while

1006
01:06:53,509 --> 01:06:56,569
<i>which just seems so bizarre
by now, but it's...</i>

1007
01:06:56,679 --> 01:06:59,375
We would go, when we lived in the Valley,
to the Van Nuys courthouse.

1008
01:06:59,482 --> 01:07:02,918
We would watch when criminals
were being sentenced.

1009
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:05,783
We would watch people
getting their sentence.

1010
01:07:05,888 --> 01:07:09,517
And I think we did it...
I did it just for shock value,

1011
01:07:09,625 --> 01:07:11,616
and because it was something
I had never done.

1012
01:07:11,727 --> 01:07:15,322
But he did it, I think,
to remind him

1013
01:07:15,431 --> 01:07:19,891
if he went to that dark place,
what his life would be.

1014
01:07:22,104 --> 01:07:24,038
I'm in love
with my animal friends.

1015
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:27,507
I'm in love with my animal friends!
In love with my animal friends.

1016
01:07:27,610 --> 01:07:30,044
I'm very, very troubled.

1017
01:07:36,318 --> 01:07:38,286
It's very emotional.

1018
01:07:39,588 --> 01:07:42,250
It's probably not cool
even looking like this.

1019
01:07:42,358 --> 01:07:47,489
I'm so in love with them, and they're
so f-ed over, which so sucks.

1020
01:07:49,799 --> 01:07:52,495
Do you know you're the star
for all the children.

1021
01:07:54,370 --> 01:07:58,272
They love you. And I love you so much,
and thank you.

1022
01:08:00,810 --> 01:08:03,404
Thank you for being my friend.

1023
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:14,084
Isn't this... so sad?

1024
01:08:15,191 --> 01:08:18,388
This is a bumblebee

1025
01:08:18,494 --> 01:08:22,260
who expired as it was working

1026
01:08:22,364 --> 01:08:26,095
at doing the pollen thing
on this Alaskan fireweed.

1027
01:08:26,202 --> 01:08:31,139
And it just is... Just has
really touched me to no end.

1028
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:35,700
It was doing its duty,
it was flying around.

1029
01:08:35,811 --> 01:08:41,408
Working busy as a bee,
and it died right there.

1030
01:08:41,517 --> 01:08:44,452
It's beautiful, it's sad,
it's tragic.

1031
01:08:44,553 --> 01:08:46,748
I love that bee.

1032
01:08:49,492 --> 01:08:51,585
Well, the bee moved.

1033
01:08:53,362 --> 01:08:55,421
Was it sleeping?

1034
01:09:12,348 --> 01:09:14,248
There's your poop.

1035
01:09:15,651 --> 01:09:17,812
It just came out of her butt.

1036
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:20,718
I can feel it.

1037
01:09:22,858 --> 01:09:25,793
I can feel the poop.

1038
01:09:25,895 --> 01:09:28,887
It's warm.
It just came from her butt.

1039
01:09:29,965 --> 01:09:31,956
This was just inside of her.

1040
01:09:32,067 --> 01:09:34,228
My girl.

1041
01:09:34,336 --> 01:09:36,236
I'm touching it.

1042
01:09:37,406 --> 01:09:39,169
It's her poop.
It's Wendy's poop.

1043
01:09:39,275 --> 01:09:43,974
I know it may seem weird that I touched
her poop, but it was inside of her.

1044
01:09:44,079 --> 01:09:47,139
It's what... It's her life!

1045
01:09:47,249 --> 01:09:49,444
It's her! And she's
so precious to me.

1046
01:09:49,552 --> 01:09:53,113
She gave me Downey.
Downey's... I adore Downey.

1047
01:09:54,490 --> 01:09:57,186
Everything about them is perfect.

1048
01:09:57,293 --> 01:10:00,228
<i>Perfection belonged to the bears.</i>

1049
01:10:00,329 --> 01:10:03,162
<i>But once in a while,
Treadwell came face-to-face</i>

1050
01:10:03,265 --> 01:10:06,393
<i>with the harsh reality
of wild nature.</i>

1051
01:10:06,502 --> 01:10:09,471
<i>This did not fit into
his sentimentalized view</i>

1052
01:10:09,572 --> 01:10:11,699
<i>that everything out there
was good,</i>

1053
01:10:11,807 --> 01:10:15,743
<i>and the universe in balance
and in harmony.</i>

1054
01:10:15,844 --> 01:10:21,077
<i>Male bears sometimes kill cubs to stop
the females from lactating,</i>

1055
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:24,949
<i>and thus have them ready again
for fornication.</i>

1056
01:10:36,565 --> 01:10:38,499
Oh, God!

1057
01:10:39,902 --> 01:10:41,699
I love you.

1058
01:10:43,172 --> 01:10:45,936
I love you and I

1059
01:10:47,509 --> 01:10:49,909
don't understand.

1060
01:10:51,413 --> 01:10:53,244
It's a painful world.

1061
01:10:53,349 --> 01:10:55,340
<i>Here I differ with Treadwell.</i>

1062
01:10:55,451 --> 01:10:59,649
<i>He seemed to ignore the fact that
in nature there are predators.</i>

1063
01:10:59,755 --> 01:11:03,919
<i>I believe the common denominator
of the universe is not harmony,</i>

1064
01:11:04,026 --> 01:11:07,792
<i>but chaos, hostility and murder.</i>

1065
01:11:07,896 --> 01:11:09,796
He wandered too far
from the den.

1066
01:11:09,898 --> 01:11:12,924
And the wolves last night
that I heard howling,

1067
01:11:13,035 --> 01:11:16,061
screeching in glee
and excitement,

1068
01:11:16,171 --> 01:11:20,164
it was over the termination
of one of the babies.

1069
01:11:20,276 --> 01:11:23,404
This Expedition 2001
has taken a sad turn,

1070
01:11:23,512 --> 01:11:25,446
but it is a real turn.

1071
01:11:25,547 --> 01:11:29,711
And I mourn the death
of this gorgeous baby fox.

1072
01:11:29,818 --> 01:11:31,786
Good-bye, little fox.

1073
01:11:35,357 --> 01:11:38,121
Get out of his eye,
you friggin' fly!

1074
01:11:38,227 --> 01:11:41,958
Don't do it when I'm around.
Have some respect, you fucker.

1075
01:11:42,264 --> 01:11:44,425
<i>Most disturbing for him</i>

1076
01:11:44,533 --> 01:11:47,502
<i>was to find the skull
of a young bear.</i>

1077
01:11:47,603 --> 01:11:50,868
<i>In the summer of 2000
came an extended drought.</i>

1078
01:11:50,973 --> 01:11:55,000
<i>The creek was so low that for weeks
there was no salmon run,</i>

1079
01:11:55,110 --> 01:11:57,704
<i>and starving bears
simply ate their own.</i>

1080
01:11:59,915 --> 01:12:05,217
It has been only five, not even six days
since the baby died.

1081
01:12:05,321 --> 01:12:09,052
And this is all that's left
of the little tyke.

1082
01:12:09,158 --> 01:12:11,558
That's it!
There's nothing else left.

1083
01:12:11,660 --> 01:12:14,128
They've eaten everything.

1084
01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:20,362
It's so sad.
She was so cute.

1085
01:12:21,704 --> 01:12:25,504
Five days and all
that's left is a skull.

1086
01:12:27,643 --> 01:12:30,476
<i>This called for desperate measures.</i>

1087
01:12:30,579 --> 01:12:35,107
There are fish lining up
about to try to make a run.

1088
01:12:35,217 --> 01:12:39,210
And now they have a good reason for going
because I have built them a corridor.

1089
01:12:39,321 --> 01:12:42,779
Let's have a look at it.
What I have done is... Have a look.

1090
01:12:42,891 --> 01:12:48,124
I've constructed a runway for them,
a navigational trail.

1091
01:12:48,230 --> 01:12:51,165
<i>When interference with nature
was not enough,</i>

1092
01:12:51,266 --> 01:12:54,258
<i>he had to invoke higher powers.</i>

1093
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:58,238
Oh, live TV.
Live on tape.

1094
01:12:58,340 --> 01:13:02,367
Okay, so here's the deal.
Pull this down a little bit.

1095
01:13:04,646 --> 01:13:06,546
It's September 20.

1096
01:13:06,648 --> 01:13:09,549
It's the year 2000.
It's Expedition 2000.

1097
01:13:09,651 --> 01:13:12,381
There has not been a substantial rainfall
for almost two months.

1098
01:13:12,488 --> 01:13:16,185
The fish have not run since
about August 2, August 3.

1099
01:13:16,291 --> 01:13:20,057
We are now getting our first rain,
but it has just slowed down.

1100
01:13:20,162 --> 01:13:23,757
We need at least 2 inches,
I think even 3 inches of rain.

1101
01:13:23,866 --> 01:13:27,358
In the last two hours, we're up
a little over.20 inches of rain.

1102
01:13:27,469 --> 01:13:32,304
That is not enough. We're gonna
need more rain. We need more rain!

1103
01:13:32,408 --> 01:13:35,639
Downey is hungry!
Tabitha's hungry!

1104
01:13:35,744 --> 01:13:38,212
Melissa is eating her babies.

1105
01:13:39,615 --> 01:13:43,642
I'm like a fucking nut.
We've got to have some rain.

1106
01:13:43,752 --> 01:13:46,312
I'm not a religious guy. No.

1107
01:13:46,422 --> 01:13:50,654
But I'm telling ya,
I'm just pissed because...

1108
01:13:52,161 --> 01:13:54,425
It just doesn't seem right.
It just doesn't seem right.

1109
01:13:54,530 --> 01:13:57,397
I know it's just weather
and crap like that, and it's...

1110
01:13:57,499 --> 01:13:59,729
I don't know what
the variables are.

1111
01:13:59,835 --> 01:14:02,167
But we've gotta have
some goddamn rain!

1112
01:14:02,271 --> 01:14:05,832
So if there's a God,
Downey needs to eat!

1113
01:14:05,941 --> 01:14:07,841
Dump on us. Hurt us!

1114
01:14:07,943 --> 01:14:09,376
Come on!

1115
01:14:14,483 --> 01:14:16,383
Think rain.

1116
01:14:18,620 --> 01:14:20,918
Think rain.

1117
01:14:21,023 --> 01:14:24,789
Just a crappy little shower right now.
What kind of crappy... Come on!

1118
01:14:24,893 --> 01:14:26,485
Take this again.

1119
01:14:26,595 --> 01:14:29,689
Does not make me
very, very happy.

1120
01:14:29,798 --> 01:14:34,963
I want rain. I want, if there's a God,
to kick some ass down here.

1121
01:14:35,070 --> 01:14:36,970
Let's have some water!

1122
01:14:37,072 --> 01:14:39,802
Jesus, boy!
Let's have some water!

1123
01:14:39,908 --> 01:14:42,308
Christ man or Allah

1124
01:14:42,411 --> 01:14:46,211
or Hindu floaty thing,

1125
01:14:46,315 --> 01:14:50,251
let's have some fucking water
for these animals!

1126
01:14:58,393 --> 01:15:04,161
It is now September 21, Thursday
of the year 2000. Expedition 2000.

1127
01:15:04,266 --> 01:15:06,234
I am the Lord's humble servant.

1128
01:15:06,335 --> 01:15:09,566
I am Allah's disciple.

1129
01:15:09,671 --> 01:15:14,131
I am the floaty thing's go-for boy.

1130
01:15:14,243 --> 01:15:17,804
There has been a miracle here.
There has been an absolute miracle.

1131
01:15:17,913 --> 01:15:21,872
It has rained 1.65 inches
of rain today.

1132
01:15:21,984 --> 01:15:25,920
We have over 2 inches now in the storm,
and it is not stopping.

1133
01:15:26,021 --> 01:15:28,012
It may hit 3 inches of rain.

1134
01:15:28,123 --> 01:15:31,854
<i>It went from a trickle to a flood.
And it's amazing.</i>

1135
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:34,121
And we have a really,
really great chance

1136
01:15:34,229 --> 01:15:37,562
of a run of fish for the animals.

1137
01:15:37,666 --> 01:15:40,635
And what is even more miraculous,

1138
01:15:40,736 --> 01:15:44,297
according to my radio,
it is not raining much

1139
01:15:44,406 --> 01:15:46,567
around anywhere else
but around here.

1140
01:15:50,512 --> 01:15:52,537
Oops.

1141
01:15:55,350 --> 01:15:59,810
Well, it's now after 2:00
on October 4.

1142
01:15:59,922 --> 01:16:02,516
And the tent has caved in
due to the storm.

1143
01:16:02,624 --> 01:16:05,286
I'm still here with my little teddy bear,
Tabitha bear.

1144
01:16:05,394 --> 01:16:08,454
And I think the storm's actually
gotten a little weaker, but

1145
01:16:08,564 --> 01:16:12,762
in the course of it getting stronger,
it crushed the wall in and bent the poles.

1146
01:16:12,868 --> 01:16:15,803
And you really can't do much about it
because once they get like that,

1147
01:16:15,904 --> 01:16:20,364
they just stay kind of bent in
and you're screwed and all that.

1148
01:16:21,910 --> 01:16:24,970
This is my life.
This is what I do.

1149
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:27,571
And l... I love it. I love it.

1150
01:16:27,683 --> 01:16:29,446
Even this, I love it.

1151
01:16:30,652 --> 01:16:34,645
My tent crushed in. I love it.
It's pathetic, but I love it.

1152
01:16:34,756 --> 01:16:37,452
<i>Hello, hello, hello</i>

1153
01:16:41,196 --> 01:16:42,959
Are you scared, little bear?

1154
01:16:43,065 --> 01:16:45,295
The storm's gonna go on
and on and on.

1155
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:48,665
It doesn't look like I may get outta here
for another week or so.

1156
01:16:51,006 --> 01:16:55,807
Oh, look at this. I put my tripod
up to shore up the tent.

1157
01:16:55,911 --> 01:16:59,074
I put a pole up there, so now I got a tent.
That's a pretty good idea, huh?

1158
01:16:59,181 --> 01:17:01,706
Aha! Pretty good for me.

1159
01:17:13,462 --> 01:17:18,365
<i>We have about 35,000 brown
grizzly bears here in Alaska.</i>

1160
01:17:18,467 --> 01:17:22,631
What we can tell, it's a very healthy population,
it's a stable population.

1161
01:17:22,738 --> 01:17:25,730
Of course, you have to be careful with bears
because they have unique needs,

1162
01:17:25,841 --> 01:17:27,775
<i>especially the grizzly bear.</i>

1163
01:17:27,876 --> 01:17:31,312
They need large areas.
They have low reproductive rates.

1164
01:17:31,413 --> 01:17:34,075
<i>You have to be cautious in the way
you utilize those animals.</i>

1165
01:17:34,182 --> 01:17:36,082
Bear hunting, as an example,

1166
01:17:36,184 --> 01:17:38,550
is a very important aspect
of the economy.

1167
01:17:38,654 --> 01:17:41,817
$4,500,000 a year
is spent on bear hunts.

1168
01:17:41,923 --> 01:17:45,882
Here on Kodiak Island
we have about 3,000 bears.

1169
01:17:45,994 --> 01:17:49,054
Each year we harvest
about 160 of those.

1170
01:17:49,164 --> 01:17:53,760
Through our research, we found that you can
harvest about 6% of the population annually

1171
01:17:53,869 --> 01:17:56,497
and still have
a healthy group of bears.

1172
01:17:57,539 --> 01:17:59,336
And poaching?

1173
01:17:59,441 --> 01:18:01,875
Poaching is not as big
a concern around here

1174
01:18:01,977 --> 01:18:06,209
as it has been in Russia, for instance,
and some other locations.

1175
01:18:06,314 --> 01:18:08,544
There is some poaching
that occurs for gall bladders

1176
01:18:08,650 --> 01:18:10,709
or some bears that
are just killed wantonly

1177
01:18:10,819 --> 01:18:13,879
because people don't like them
or they're afraid of them.

1178
01:18:13,989 --> 01:18:17,390
But for the most part, here on Kodiak
and on the Alaska peninsula,

1179
01:18:17,492 --> 01:18:20,484
it is a very rare occurrence
in the last 20 years.

1180
01:18:21,630 --> 01:18:23,598
<i>Despite the statistics,</i>

1181
01:18:23,699 --> 01:18:26,099
<i>Treadwell became
increasingly paranoid</i>

1182
01:18:26,201 --> 01:18:28,931
<i>about his enemy, the poacher.</i>

1183
01:18:29,037 --> 01:18:32,200
And it's gotten to be September,
near October.

1184
01:18:32,307 --> 01:18:34,502
It's the time of year
where poachers can come around.

1185
01:18:34,609 --> 01:18:37,669
It's time for me to go in my guerrilla-style
camouflage outfit.

1186
01:18:37,779 --> 01:18:41,112
<i>Downey still recognizes me
by talking to her. Don't you?</i>

1187
01:18:41,216 --> 01:18:44,447
<i>Yeah, I'm the big crazy guy with the...
or the skinny crazy guy</i>

1188
01:18:44,553 --> 01:18:47,784
with the camouflage makeup on.

1189
01:18:52,828 --> 01:18:56,696
They're armed with pepper spray
and rocks.

1190
01:18:56,798 --> 01:18:59,892
<i>In all his video recordings
over the years,</i>

1191
01:19:00,001 --> 01:19:04,199
<i>this is Treadwell's closest
encounter with intruders.</i>

1192
01:19:04,306 --> 01:19:07,275
I believe the guide is the person
with the camera.

1193
01:19:07,375 --> 01:19:11,209
The big camera on the tripod.
There we go. Got a nice close-up of him.

1194
01:19:11,313 --> 01:19:14,976
He's the one who threw the rock
at Freckles, the bear.

1195
01:19:15,083 --> 01:19:18,746
It's Quincy.

1196
01:19:18,854 --> 01:19:20,845
They're throwing rocks at him.

1197
01:19:20,956 --> 01:19:23,891
They're throwing rocks
at my Quincy.

1198
01:19:23,992 --> 01:19:26,460
They're gonna stone him,
and then they're gonna photograph him.

1199
01:19:34,803 --> 01:19:36,532
Oh, that's it!

1200
01:19:36,638 --> 01:19:38,663
That's enough of this.

1201
01:19:38,774 --> 01:19:41,607
That's... I can... They hit Quincy.

1202
01:19:45,547 --> 01:19:48,311
I don't wanna expose myself
to them.

1203
01:19:48,416 --> 01:19:52,682
I'm submitting this
as Sunday, August 1.

1204
01:19:52,788 --> 01:19:58,055
It is 4:35 and 18 seconds
on this day.

1205
01:20:00,295 --> 01:20:02,456
It's hard to say,
but it's a warning of a sort.

1206
01:20:02,564 --> 01:20:05,556
And it's obviously here
to upset me.

1207
01:20:07,435 --> 01:20:11,769
"Hi, Timothy.
See you in summer of 2001."

1208
01:20:11,873 --> 01:20:14,273
Now it doesn't say, "Hi, Timothy.
We're gonna fucking kill you."

1209
01:20:14,376 --> 01:20:17,903
It doesn't say, "Hi, Timothy. You're fucking
dead. We're gonna chop your legs off.

1210
01:20:18,013 --> 01:20:20,140
Hey, Timothy,
get the fuck out."

1211
01:20:20,248 --> 01:20:23,445
It just says, "See you
in the summer of 2001."

1212
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:25,486
But it is some sort
of a warning.

1213
01:20:25,587 --> 01:20:27,919
It is some sort of a ha-ha.

1214
01:20:28,023 --> 01:20:29,991
I don't think it's friendly.

1215
01:20:30,091 --> 01:20:34,152
Well, it's gotten
a little worse here.

1216
01:20:34,262 --> 01:20:37,356
The warning, "Hi, Timothy.
See you summer of 2001."

1217
01:20:37,465 --> 01:20:41,765
Now I find this big stack of rocks that were,
you know, put some labor here.

1218
01:20:41,870 --> 01:20:46,807
We're not calling this
the building of the pyramids.

1219
01:20:46,908 --> 01:20:49,570
But we are saying
there's a bit of trouble.

1220
01:20:49,678 --> 01:20:52,841
Now, I'm gonna walk back,
I'm gonna bring you back here.

1221
01:20:54,983 --> 01:20:59,147
Through my camp.
Let's come through here. Pathway.

1222
01:20:59,254 --> 01:21:01,188
Here's where...

1223
01:21:01,289 --> 01:21:05,089
Here's where the sign was, here.
Which is where my tent is.

1224
01:21:05,193 --> 01:21:08,651
And then we go over where
my bear-proof barrels would be.

1225
01:21:08,763 --> 01:21:12,961
And we find boulders piled up...

1226
01:21:13,068 --> 01:21:15,093
Boulders piled up

1227
01:21:15,203 --> 01:21:20,072
and a happy face indelibly
painted into the rock,

1228
01:21:20,175 --> 01:21:22,200
like looking at me.

1229
01:21:25,013 --> 01:21:27,914
Very, very frickin' frightening, huh?

1230
01:21:28,016 --> 01:21:29,984
Whoever put it there,

1231
01:21:32,888 --> 01:21:36,016
knew what they were doing.

1232
01:21:36,124 --> 01:21:37,785
It's a warning.

1233
01:21:37,893 --> 01:21:42,592
And the thing is, it's better
than a warning, than...

1234
01:21:42,697 --> 01:21:45,325
It's better than like,
"You're fucking dead" type of thing.

1235
01:21:45,433 --> 01:21:47,993
It's creepy, baby!
It's creepy.

1236
01:21:48,103 --> 01:21:50,071
It's Freddy Krueger creepy.

1237
01:21:52,574 --> 01:21:54,735
<i>There were visitors
every now and then.</i>

1238
01:21:54,843 --> 01:21:57,869
<i>But for Treadwell,
they were just intruders.</i>

1239
01:21:57,979 --> 01:22:02,507
<i>An encroaching threat upon what
he considered his Eden.</i>

1240
01:22:04,986 --> 01:22:08,012
<i>Even the Park Service itself
became an enemy</i>

1241
01:22:08,123 --> 01:22:10,557
<i>because of its restrictions.</i>

1242
01:22:11,927 --> 01:22:15,124
I have decided to violate
a federal rule

1243
01:22:15,230 --> 01:22:18,256
which states
I must camp one mile...

1244
01:22:18,366 --> 01:22:22,427
Every week I must move one mile after
staying for seven consecutive days.

1245
01:22:22,537 --> 01:22:24,437
If I was to do that,

1246
01:22:24,539 --> 01:22:27,406
I would not be able to study these bears,
not be able to protect them.

1247
01:22:27,509 --> 01:22:31,036
I'd have to move out of the bay
to get a mile out.

1248
01:22:31,146 --> 01:22:35,549
Therefore I have decided to protest
the United States government

1249
01:22:35,650 --> 01:22:38,380
and guard these bears anyway
and stay, and I have...

1250
01:22:38,486 --> 01:22:43,287
<i>In order to get around the rule of not
camping permanently in one spot,</i>

1251
01:22:43,391 --> 01:22:47,919
<i>he would camouflage and hide
his tent from the Park Service.</i>

1252
01:22:48,029 --> 01:22:51,328
<i>But more than that,
he was in constant violation</i>

1253
01:22:51,433 --> 01:22:54,231
<i>of another very reasonable
park rule:</i>

1254
01:22:54,336 --> 01:22:59,672
<i>That you have to maintain at least 100 yards
distance from the bears.</i>

1255
01:22:59,774 --> 01:23:01,605
Ding.

1256
01:23:02,978 --> 01:23:06,038
Hi. Go back to your friend.
Go back to your friend.

1257
01:23:07,315 --> 01:23:09,613
Shh, shh, shh.
It's okay.

1258
01:23:09,718 --> 01:23:11,845
It's okay.

1259
01:23:11,953 --> 01:23:15,081
You're awfully close.
You're awfully close.

1260
01:23:15,190 --> 01:23:17,590
Hi. Oh, hi, there!

1261
01:23:17,692 --> 01:23:21,492
<i>The park restrictions made him
increasingly irate.</i>

1262
01:23:25,934 --> 01:23:29,665
Well, we're into autumn now.
Expedition 2001 coming to an end.

1263
01:23:29,771 --> 01:23:32,205
The bears moving safely
towards their winter dens.

1264
01:23:32,307 --> 01:23:34,241
The foxes hiding in the woods,

1265
01:23:34,342 --> 01:23:37,175
safe from the humans
that would come to harm them.

1266
01:23:37,278 --> 01:23:39,974
<i>It's been an amazing season.
It's been difficult.</i>

1267
01:23:40,081 --> 01:23:44,074
But I came, I served,
I protected and I studied.

1268
01:23:44,185 --> 01:23:46,619
And I promise, I'll be back.

1269
01:23:56,398 --> 01:23:58,992
My hair.

1270
01:23:59,100 --> 01:24:03,594
<i>Expedition 2001 coming to an end for
Grizzly People, for me, Timothy Treadwell.</i>

1271
01:24:03,705 --> 01:24:06,196
I came here and protected
the animals as best I could.

1272
01:24:06,307 --> 01:24:09,504
In fact, I'm the only protection
for these animals out here.

1273
01:24:09,611 --> 01:24:13,012
The government flying over a total
of two times in two months.

1274
01:24:13,114 --> 01:24:16,106
How dare they!
How dare they challenge me!

1275
01:24:16,217 --> 01:24:18,777
How dare they smear me
with their campaigns!

1276
01:24:18,887 --> 01:24:21,583
How dare they, when they do not
look after these animals,

1277
01:24:21,689 --> 01:24:24,180
and I come here in peace
and in love,

1278
01:24:24,292 --> 01:24:26,624
neutral in respect.

1279
01:24:28,329 --> 01:24:30,263
I will continue to do this.
I will fight them.

1280
01:24:30,365 --> 01:24:32,799
I will be an American dissident
if I need be.

1281
01:24:32,901 --> 01:24:34,869
There's a patriotic time
going on right now,

1282
01:24:34,969 --> 01:24:36,994
but as far as this
fucking government's concerned,

1283
01:24:37,105 --> 01:24:39,471
fuck you,
motherfucking Park Service!

1284
01:24:39,574 --> 01:24:42,372
<i>Now Treadwell crosses a line
with the Park Service</i>

1285
01:24:42,477 --> 01:24:44,775
<i>which we will not cross.</i>

1286
01:24:44,879 --> 01:24:50,112
<i>He attacks the individuals with
whom he worked for 13 years.</i>

1287
01:24:50,218 --> 01:24:52,914
I beat your fucking asses!
I protected the animals!

1288
01:24:53,021 --> 01:24:55,649
I did it! Fuck you!

1289
01:24:56,825 --> 01:24:59,919
Animals rule.
Timothy conquered.

1290
01:25:00,028 --> 01:25:02,622
Fuck you, Park Service!

1291
01:25:04,332 --> 01:25:05,856
Okay.

1292
01:25:05,967 --> 01:25:08,834
<i>It is clear to me that the Park Service</i>

1293
01:25:08,937 --> 01:25:12,373
<i>is not Treadwell's real enemy.</i>

1294
01:25:12,474 --> 01:25:16,205
<i>There's a larger, more
implacable adversary out there:</i>

1295
01:25:16,311 --> 01:25:19,178
<i>The people's world
and civilization.</i>

1296
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:22,181
"Oh, Timothy, I'm getting
a bad feeling about you."

1297
01:25:22,283 --> 01:25:25,616
<i>He only has mockery
and contempt for it.</i>

1298
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:29,622
<i>"I saw you on David Letterman.
You're fairly entertaining."</i>

1299
01:25:29,724 --> 01:25:34,218
<i>His rage is almost
incandescent, artistic.</i>

1300
01:25:34,329 --> 01:25:38,527
<i>The actor in his film has
taken over from the filmmaker.</i>

1301
01:25:38,633 --> 01:25:42,364
<i>I have seen this madness
before on a film set.</i>

1302
01:25:42,470 --> 01:25:47,533
<i>But Treadwell is not an actor in opposition
to a director or a producer.</i>

1303
01:25:47,642 --> 01:25:51,601
<i>He's fighting civilization itself.</i>

1304
01:25:51,713 --> 01:25:55,945
<i>It is the same civilization
that cast Thoreau out of Walden</i>

1305
01:25:56,050 --> 01:25:58,814
<i>and John Muir into the wild.</i>

1306
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:00,581
Animals rule.

1307
01:26:02,390 --> 01:26:05,518
All right.
That's my happy stuff.

1308
01:26:05,627 --> 01:26:07,822
Let's do a couple
of nice takes now.

1309
01:26:07,929 --> 01:26:10,295
Oh, man, did I get angry!
Fuck them, right?

1310
01:26:10,398 --> 01:26:12,662
They do not watch these animals.
They don't care about these animals.

1311
01:26:12,767 --> 01:26:16,066
All they wanna do
is screw people like me around.

1312
01:26:16,171 --> 01:26:18,503
<i>It's amazing. "Let the fishermen
fucking shoot the animals.</i>

1313
01:26:18,606 --> 01:26:20,437
Let the fucking poachers
come in here and fuck 'em.

1314
01:26:20,542 --> 01:26:22,442
Let the fucking commercial
people fuck them around

1315
01:26:22,544 --> 01:26:25,138
with their fucking cameras
and the tourists.

1316
01:26:25,246 --> 01:26:27,077
But we're gonna go screw
with Timothy Treadwell

1317
01:26:27,182 --> 01:26:29,912
because he loves animals
and teaches kids for free.

1318
01:26:30,018 --> 01:26:31,713
Let's go. Let's do that.
That's what we're gonna do."

1319
01:26:31,819 --> 01:26:35,186
Well, fuck them. Fuck them.
I beat you, motherfuckers. I beat you.

1320
01:26:35,290 --> 01:26:37,190
Beat ya, so fuck you.

1321
01:26:37,292 --> 01:26:39,852
I beat ya. I beat ya.

1322
01:26:39,961 --> 01:26:41,519
I'm the champion.
I'm the fucking champion.

1323
01:26:41,629 --> 01:26:44,757
I beat you.
I beat your fucking asses.

1324
01:26:44,866 --> 01:26:48,597
Fucking losers!
Fucking nobodies!

1325
01:26:48,703 --> 01:26:50,568
Fuck!

1326
01:26:50,672 --> 01:26:53,664
Fucking fucks!

1327
01:26:55,777 --> 01:26:57,745
Well, Expedition 2001
coming to an end.

1328
01:26:57,845 --> 01:27:01,611
The bears safely moving into their winter dens,
the foxes hiding in the woods.

1329
01:27:01,716 --> 01:27:05,482
I came here. I studied them,
protected them.

1330
01:27:05,587 --> 01:27:11,355
<i>And I promise you, I promise the
Grizzly People, I will be back. I will be back.</i>

1331
01:27:11,459 --> 01:27:15,589
And I thank the animals for keeping
me safe and for inspiring me.

1332
01:27:15,697 --> 01:27:17,995
I thank them so very much.

1333
01:27:19,167 --> 01:27:21,101
Good-bye.

1334
01:27:23,137 --> 01:27:25,401
This is my favorite.

1335
01:27:25,506 --> 01:27:27,440
This is my cowboy.

1336
01:27:27,542 --> 01:27:30,170
Always in black.
Always sunglasses.

1337
01:27:30,278 --> 01:27:32,303
And always a bandanna.

1338
01:27:33,948 --> 01:27:36,542
I miss you terribly.

1339
01:27:38,319 --> 01:27:40,480
He was very dear to my heart.

1340
01:27:40,588 --> 01:27:42,783
Very dear to my heart.

1341
01:27:45,693 --> 01:27:48,719
My heart hurts every day
for him.

1342
01:27:48,830 --> 01:27:50,661
He was a good friend.

1343
01:27:53,935 --> 01:27:56,028
I've known him 13 years.

1344
01:27:56,137 --> 01:27:58,105
And he just was a good friend.

1345
01:27:58,206 --> 01:28:00,970
He was a distant friend
in the winter

1346
01:28:01,075 --> 01:28:03,202
and a close friend
in the summer.

1347
01:28:03,311 --> 01:28:07,372
And... I helped him do
quite a few things here.

1348
01:28:08,416 --> 01:28:10,247
He'd always come back.

1349
01:28:10,351 --> 01:28:13,115
And I was kind of
his confidante here.

1350
01:28:15,356 --> 01:28:16,789
But I miss him.

1351
01:28:16,891 --> 01:28:21,055
I miss his... rambunctious personality

1352
01:28:21,162 --> 01:28:23,790
and his outgoing... his heart,

1353
01:28:23,898 --> 01:28:26,992
you know, just everything
about him, I think.

1354
01:28:28,303 --> 01:28:30,271
<i>Kathleen Parker still holds</i>

1355
01:28:30,371 --> 01:28:33,169
<i>some of
Timothy Treadwell's ashes.</i>

1356
01:28:33,274 --> 01:28:37,506
<i>She insists that she was
a platonic friend only.</i>

1357
01:28:37,612 --> 01:28:41,605
<i>She stored his gear in her basement
during the winters.</i>

1358
01:28:41,716 --> 01:28:45,584
<i>He would set out into
the wilderness from her house.</i>

1359
01:28:45,687 --> 01:28:49,919
When he would leave,
he would say at my back door,

1360
01:28:50,024 --> 01:28:51,992
he says, "I love you."

1361
01:28:52,093 --> 01:28:56,120
He says, "This is going to be
the best year of my life out there."

1362
01:28:56,230 --> 01:28:59,324
And he says,
"If I don't come back,

1363
01:28:59,434 --> 01:29:03,029
it's what I want,
this is the way I wanna go."

1364
01:29:06,207 --> 01:29:10,109
His last camp was just right
in the right-hand edge of this slope.

1365
01:29:10,211 --> 01:29:12,304
Patch of trees here.

1366
01:29:15,450 --> 01:29:19,546
Right down here in this...
very end of these trees here.

1367
01:29:38,806 --> 01:29:40,774
This is his ashes.

1368
01:29:40,875 --> 01:29:43,571
Some of them for me to spread.

1369
01:29:43,678 --> 01:29:47,739
And some bear hair, fur.

1370
01:29:47,849 --> 01:29:51,444
And some weeds.
And what else is in there?

1371
01:29:51,552 --> 01:29:54,885
There's a little bit of lupin,
there's a little bit of iris.

1372
01:29:54,989 --> 01:29:58,755
- There's, I think...
- Where did you get the bear fur?

1373
01:29:58,860 --> 01:30:01,556
- We picked it up off the ground.
- Cool. Cool.

1374
01:30:01,662 --> 01:30:03,527
Where are we?

1375
01:30:03,631 --> 01:30:06,998
We are at a campsite
where Timothy last camped.

1376
01:30:07,101 --> 01:30:12,368
Not where he was killed.
But over here in Hallo Bay.

1377
01:30:12,473 --> 01:30:15,533
And, Willie, you can...
'cause you brought him over here.

1378
01:30:15,643 --> 01:30:19,170
His last campsite was right here
in the trees here.

1379
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:22,010
<i>He camped there because
he was right between two fox dens.</i>

1380
01:30:22,116 --> 01:30:23,947
<i>I'd been in the camp there.</i>

1381
01:30:24,051 --> 01:30:29,387
<i>The fox would come right to the edge
of the tent, and go in their dens.</i>

1382
01:30:29,490 --> 01:30:33,824
<i>So I think that's probably the main reason
he camped right there.</i>

1383
01:30:35,596 --> 01:30:37,359
<i>Okay, Timothy.</i>

1384
01:30:39,300 --> 01:30:40,858
I love you.

1385
01:30:43,538 --> 01:30:46,063
And rest peacefully.

1386
01:30:49,377 --> 01:30:51,777
Rest peacefully, my love.

1387
01:30:54,749 --> 01:30:57,843
Finally figured a way out
to live here forever.

1388
01:30:57,952 --> 01:30:59,579
He's here forever.

1389
01:31:05,560 --> 01:31:08,552
<i>This is Timothy Treadwell's
and Amie Huguenard's route</i>

1390
01:31:08,663 --> 01:31:11,461
<i>to the site of their death.</i>

1391
01:31:11,566 --> 01:31:15,002
<i>There was a certain absurdity
in their end.</i>

1392
01:31:15,102 --> 01:31:19,163
<i>As usual, the expedition was over
by the end of September,</i>

1393
01:31:19,273 --> 01:31:24,074
<i>and both had returned to Kodiak
on their way back to California.</i>

1394
01:31:25,446 --> 01:31:28,472
<i>Treadwell writes in his diary
that at the airport</i>

1395
01:31:28,583 --> 01:31:32,075
<i>he had an altercation
with an obese airline agent</i>

1396
01:31:32,186 --> 01:31:35,178
<i>over the validity of his ticket.</i>

1397
01:31:35,289 --> 01:31:38,520
<i>"How much I hate
the people's world, " he writes.</i>

1398
01:31:38,626 --> 01:31:40,821
<i>And disgusted,
he decides right then</i>

1399
01:31:40,928 --> 01:31:44,261
<i>to return to this spot
and his bears.</i>

1400
01:31:46,133 --> 01:31:50,467
<i>Once back in the Grizzly Maze,
Amie had mixed feelings.</i>

1401
01:31:50,571 --> 01:31:52,562
<i>She was afraid of the bears</i>

1402
01:31:52,673 --> 01:31:55,506
<i>and had a deadline to return
for a new job</i>

1403
01:31:55,610 --> 01:31:59,444
<i>and spoke openly
about leaving him for good.</i>

1404
01:31:59,547 --> 01:32:03,608
<i>According to one of the last entries
in Treadwell's diary,</i>

1405
01:32:03,718 --> 01:32:08,246
<i>Amie called him hell-bent
on destruction.</i>

1406
01:32:08,356 --> 01:32:13,419
<i>And yet, inexplicably, she remained
with him here in the Maze.</i>

1407
01:32:20,067 --> 01:32:24,197
<i>Normally Treadwell would not
be here this late in the year.</i>

1408
01:32:24,305 --> 01:32:26,705
<i>And upon their return,</i>

1409
01:32:26,807 --> 01:32:31,141
<i>he discovered that many of his bear friends
had gone into hibernation.</i>

1410
01:32:31,245 --> 01:32:34,442
<i>And scary,
unknown and wilder bears</i>

1411
01:32:34,549 --> 01:32:36,949
<i>from the interior had moved in.</i>

1412
01:32:39,620 --> 01:32:43,351
<i>This is the spot where
they set up their last camp.</i>

1413
01:32:52,633 --> 01:32:54,567
Let me tell you.

1414
01:32:54,669 --> 01:32:59,663
<i>Honestly, camping in grizzly country
is dangerous.</i>

1415
01:32:59,774 --> 01:33:02,572
<i>People who camp in grizzly country
should camp out in the open</i>

1416
01:33:02,677 --> 01:33:05,339
to let the bears know
where the tent is.

1417
01:33:05,446 --> 01:33:07,414
My camp is unseen.

1418
01:33:07,515 --> 01:33:10,882
It is the most dangerous camping,
the most dangerous living

1419
01:33:10,985 --> 01:33:13,749
in the history of the world
by any human being.

1420
01:33:13,854 --> 01:33:18,587
<i>I have lived longer with wild brown
grizzly bears, without weapons,</i>

1421
01:33:18,693 --> 01:33:21,093
and that's the key, without weapons,
in modern history

1422
01:33:21,195 --> 01:33:24,995
than any human on earth,
any human.

1423
01:33:25,099 --> 01:33:26,999
And I have remained safe.

1424
01:33:27,101 --> 01:33:31,470
But every second of every day that I move
through this jungle, or even at the tent,

1425
01:33:31,572 --> 01:33:36,737
I am right on the precipice
of great bodily harm or even death.

1426
01:33:39,180 --> 01:33:41,978
And I am so thankful
for every minute of every day

1427
01:33:42,083 --> 01:33:44,017
that I found the bears

1428
01:33:44,118 --> 01:33:46,313
<i>and this place,
the Grizzly Maze.</i>

1429
01:33:51,892 --> 01:33:53,723
But let me tell you, ladies and gentlemen.

1430
01:33:53,828 --> 01:33:57,457
There is no, no, no
other place in the world

1431
01:33:57,565 --> 01:34:01,797
<i>that is more dangerous, more exciting
than the Grizzly Maze.</i>

1432
01:34:01,902 --> 01:34:04,336
Come here and camp here.
Come here and try to do what I do.

1433
01:34:04,438 --> 01:34:07,032
You will die.
You will die here.

1434
01:34:07,141 --> 01:34:10,372
You will frickin' die here.
They will get you.

1435
01:34:10,478 --> 01:34:13,845
I found a way. I found a way
to survive with them.

1436
01:34:13,948 --> 01:34:16,348
Am I a great person?
I don't know. I don't know.

1437
01:34:16,450 --> 01:34:20,147
We're all great people. Everyone has
something in them that's wonderful.

1438
01:34:20,254 --> 01:34:25,453
I'm just different. And I love these bears
enough to do it right.

1439
01:34:25,559 --> 01:34:29,723
And I'm edgy enough
and I'm tough enough.

1440
01:34:29,830 --> 01:34:35,132
But mostly I love these bears enough
to survive and do it right.

1441
01:34:35,236 --> 01:34:37,170
And I'm never giving this up.
Never giving it up.

1442
01:34:37,271 --> 01:34:40,434
<i>Never giving up the Maze.
Never.</i>

1443
01:34:40,541 --> 01:34:43,101
This is it.
This is my life.

1444
01:34:43,210 --> 01:34:45,405
This is my land.

1445
01:34:51,986 --> 01:34:55,149
<i>Very late in the process
of editing this film,</i>

1446
01:34:55,256 --> 01:34:59,022
<i>we were given access
to Treadwell's last videotape.</i>

1447
01:35:00,227 --> 01:35:03,594
<i>Here he may have filmed
his murderer.</i>

1448
01:35:06,934 --> 01:35:09,129
<i>The killer bear we know
was a male</i>

1449
01:35:09,236 --> 01:35:13,332
<i>whom years earlier
the Park Service had anesthetized.</i>

1450
01:35:13,441 --> 01:35:16,035
<i>They extracted a tooth
which established him</i>

1451
01:35:16,143 --> 01:35:19,374
<i>as being 28
at the time of the attack.</i>

1452
01:35:19,480 --> 01:35:21,880
<i>Quite old for a bear.</i>

1453
01:35:21,982 --> 01:35:26,419
<i>They also tagged him
via a tattoo on his inner lip.</i>

1454
01:35:26,520 --> 01:35:30,547
<i>They had given him
a number only, 141.</i>

1455
01:35:30,658 --> 01:35:34,685
<i>Bear 141.
That's all we know of him.</i>

1456
01:35:39,166 --> 01:35:43,125
<i>And here.
Could this one be Bear 141?</i>

1457
01:35:47,975 --> 01:35:51,502
<i>What looks playful
could be desperation.</i>

1458
01:35:51,612 --> 01:35:55,013
<i>So late in the season,
the bear is diving deep</i>

1459
01:35:55,116 --> 01:35:58,142
<i>for one of the few
remaining salmon carcasses</i>

1460
01:35:58,252 --> 01:36:00,516
<i>at the bottom of the lake.</i>

1461
01:36:20,341 --> 01:36:24,835
<i>Treadwell keeps filming the bear
with a strange persistence.</i>

1462
01:36:28,516 --> 01:36:31,110
<i>And all of a sudden, this.</i>

1463
01:36:33,754 --> 01:36:37,190
<i>Is Amie trying
to get out of the shot?</i>

1464
01:36:39,026 --> 01:36:43,827
<i>Did Treadwell wait till his last tape
to put her in his film?</i>

1465
01:36:49,069 --> 01:36:51,867
<i>And what haunts me,
is that in all the faces</i>

1466
01:36:51,972 --> 01:36:55,066
<i>of all the bears
that Treadwell ever filmed,</i>

1467
01:36:55,176 --> 01:36:59,408
<i>I discover no kinship,
no understanding, no mercy.</i>

1468
01:36:59,513 --> 01:37:04,951
<i>I see only the overwhelming
indifference of nature.</i>

1469
01:37:05,052 --> 01:37:09,955
<i>To me, there is no such thing
as a secret world of the bears.</i>

1470
01:37:10,057 --> 01:37:15,586
<i>And this blank stare speaks
only of a half-bored interest in food.</i>

1471
01:37:15,696 --> 01:37:20,998
<i>But for Timothy Treadwell,
this bear was a friend, a savior.</i>

1472
01:37:23,304 --> 01:37:25,204
<i>Amie Huguenard was screaming.</i>

1473
01:37:25,306 --> 01:37:29,367
All of a sudden, the intensity
of Amie's screaming

1474
01:37:29,476 --> 01:37:33,276
reached a new height
and became very, very loud.

1475
01:37:33,380 --> 01:37:37,612
And she really now was screaming
at the top of her lungs.

1476
01:37:37,718 --> 01:37:41,984
These horrifying screams
were punctuated by Timothy saying,

1477
01:37:42,089 --> 01:37:46,048
"Go away. Leave me.
Go away. Run! Get out of here."

1478
01:37:46,160 --> 01:37:49,789
In other words, Timothy is trying
now to save Amie's life

1479
01:37:49,897 --> 01:37:54,596
<i>because Timothy realizes,
at this point in time during this attack,</i>

1480
01:37:54,702 --> 01:37:56,829
Timothy knows he's gonna die.

1481
01:37:56,937 --> 01:37:58,871
He knows that.

1482
01:37:58,973 --> 01:38:01,669
My sense of listening
to this tape

1483
01:38:01,775 --> 01:38:04,676
is that the bear let go,
probably let go

1484
01:38:04,778 --> 01:38:08,270
of the top of his head where
I found massive lacerations.

1485
01:38:08,382 --> 01:38:12,250
That is tears of the scalp
away from his head.

1486
01:38:12,353 --> 01:38:15,186
Suddenly, though, the bear,
after letting go,

1487
01:38:15,289 --> 01:38:19,783
grabbed Timothy somewhere
in the high leg area.

1488
01:38:19,894 --> 01:38:25,093
And Timothy, appropriately in my opinion,
as a human being,

1489
01:38:25,199 --> 01:38:29,659
decided now is the time
to save one life anyway.

1490
01:38:29,770 --> 01:38:33,501
If his life was going away,
if his life was fading away,

1491
01:38:33,607 --> 01:38:36,974
<i>now was the time
for Amie to get out.</i>

1492
01:38:40,014 --> 01:38:42,949
The expedition coming close to a close,

1493
01:38:43,050 --> 01:38:45,348
but I'm still here.

1494
01:38:45,452 --> 01:38:47,283
It's been over four months
in the wilderness.

1495
01:38:47,388 --> 01:38:49,549
And a hurricane-force
storm now building.

1496
01:38:49,657 --> 01:38:53,718
Over 50-mile-an-hour winds,
soon over 70.

1497
01:38:53,827 --> 01:38:56,227
The bears safely
heading for their dens.

1498
01:38:56,330 --> 01:38:59,026
The work...
the work successful.

1499
01:38:59,133 --> 01:39:02,796
I'm over 20 pounds lighter.
My clothes are rags.

1500
01:39:02,903 --> 01:39:06,839
I've tried hard. I bleed for them,
I live for them, I die for them.

1501
01:39:07,942 --> 01:39:10,570
I love them. I love this.

1502
01:39:14,048 --> 01:39:15,845
It's tough work.

1503
01:39:17,952 --> 01:39:21,945
But it's the only work I know.
It's the only work I'll ever want.

1504
01:39:23,757 --> 01:39:26,920
Take care of these animals.
Take care of this land.

1505
01:39:27,027 --> 01:39:32,124
<i>He seems to hesitate in leaving
the last frame of his own film.</i>

1506
01:39:32,232 --> 01:39:35,065
It's the only thing I know.

1507
01:39:35,169 --> 01:39:37,694
It's the only thing
I wanna know.

1508
01:39:47,715 --> 01:39:49,808
<i>Treadwell is gone.</i>

1509
01:39:49,917 --> 01:39:52,943
<i>The argument how wrong
or how right he was</i>

1510
01:39:53,053 --> 01:39:56,853
<i>disappears into a distance
into a fog.</i>

1511
01:39:56,957 --> 01:40:00,290
<i>What remains is his footage.</i>

1512
01:40:00,394 --> 01:40:04,387
<i>And while we watch the animals
in their joys of being,</i>

1513
01:40:04,498 --> 01:40:06,966
<i>in their grace
and ferociousness,</i>

1514
01:40:07,067 --> 01:40:09,763
<i>a thought becomes
more and more clear.</i>

1515
01:40:09,870 --> 01:40:12,805
<i>That it is not so much
a look at wild nature</i>

1516
01:40:12,906 --> 01:40:17,138
<i>as it is an insight
into ourselves, our nature.</i>

1517
01:40:18,746 --> 01:40:21,806
<i>And that, for me,
beyond his mission,</i>

1518
01:40:21,915 --> 01:40:25,908
<i>gives meaning to his life
and to his death.</i>

1519
01:40:48,609 --> 01:40:51,134
<i>Now the longhorns are gone</i>

1520
01:40:51,245 --> 01:40:53,645
<i>And the drovers are gone</i>

1521
01:40:53,747 --> 01:40:56,147
<i>The Comanches are gone</i>

1522
01:40:56,250 --> 01:40:58,980
<i>And the outlaws are gone</i>

1523
01:40:59,086 --> 01:41:01,145
<i>Geronimo's gone</i>

1524
01:41:01,255 --> 01:41:03,780
<i>And Sam Bass is gone</i>

1525
01:41:03,891 --> 01:41:06,325
<i>And the lion is gone</i>

1526
01:41:06,427 --> 01:41:10,693
<i>- And the red wolf is gone
- And Treadwell is gone</i>

1527
01:41:12,332 --> 01:41:16,462
<i>Well, he cursed all the roads
and the old mule</i>

1528
01:41:17,571 --> 01:41:21,029
<i>And he cursed the automobile</i>

1529
01:41:22,543 --> 01:41:26,775
<i>Said this is no place
for an hombre like I am</i>

1530
01:41:28,215 --> 01:41:32,276
<i>In this new world
of asphalt and steel</i>

1531
01:41:33,921 --> 01:41:37,857
<i>Then he'd look off
someplace in the distance</i>

1532
01:41:39,059 --> 01:41:42,551
<i>At something
only he could see</i>

1533
01:41:44,131 --> 01:41:48,227
<i>He'd say all that's left now
are the old days</i>

1534
01:41:49,803 --> 01:41:54,103
<i>Damned old coyotes and me</i>

1535
01:41:54,208 --> 01:41:55,869
<i>And they'd go</i>

1536
01:42:15,295 --> 01:42:17,729
<i>Now the longhorns are gone</i>

1537
01:42:17,831 --> 01:42:20,231
<i>And the drovers are gone</i>

1538
01:42:20,334 --> 01:42:22,962
<i>The Comanches are gone</i>

1539
01:42:23,070 --> 01:42:25,334
<i>The outlaws are gone</i>

1540
01:42:25,439 --> 01:42:27,669
<i>Now Quantrill is gone</i>

1541
01:42:27,774 --> 01:42:30,368
<i>Stan Wanty is gone</i>

1542
01:42:30,477 --> 01:42:32,968
<i>And the lion is gone</i>

1543
01:42:33,080 --> 01:42:36,277
<i>And the red wolf is gone</i>

1544
01:42:40,320 --> 01:42:44,313
<i>One morning they searched
his adobe</i>

1545
01:42:45,559 --> 01:42:49,461
<i>He disappeared
without even a word</i>

1546
01:42:51,131 --> 01:42:55,261
<i>But that night as the moon
crossed the mountain</i>

1547
01:42:56,904 --> 01:43:00,863
<i>One more coyote was heard</i>

1548
01:43:03,577 --> 01:43:05,442
<i>And he'd go</i>

1549
01:43:08,442 --> 01:43:12,442
