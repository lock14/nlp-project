<i>The accused is sentenced
to three months in jail.</i>



- We have to find a way.
- It's empty in here.



What can you tell me about Blomkvist?



I think he was set up.



Henrik Vanger from the Vanger Group?



It's Harriet Vanger.
She used to babysit you.



- Who sends them to you?
- Harriet's killer.



You don't know my family.



One of them killed Harriet.



Look at the window.
That's the last picture of Harriet.



So now you're working for the big capitalists?



Give it up before you become obsessed
yourself. There is no answer.



- What is she looking at?
- Her killer.



- What are you up to?
- Henrik will invest in <i>Millennium.</i>



If you give me
any kind of trouble,



I'll make sure you spend the
rest of your life in a closed ward.



I know all about your mental problems
and your violent background.



Are you a good girl?



- Lisbeth Salander?
- Who are you?



Give it a rest.



How much do you know about my assignment?



It's a 40-year-old murder
of a 16-year-old girl.



I need your help.



PART 2



THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO



Welcome.



Yes...



Yes...



So he'll live?



Can I visit him?



Lisbeth Salander's here.



Yes.



OK, Frode.
Talk to you soon. Thanks.



IF A WOMAN APPROACHES AN ANIMAL
TO HAVE SEXUAL RELATIONS...



As we've been sharing files lately,
I assume you're up to date.



Yes.



Everyone here is a suspect.



They were all on the island
when Harriet disappeared,



except for Richard and Gottfried,
who were dead.



We know that she's afraid of someone
on the other side of the street.



Bible passages, blood and death.



Brutal content in a girl's diary.



The day she disappeared,
Harriet talked to the local vicar,



Otto Falk.
We know that they used to meet.



Harriet was 16
and came from a non-religious family.



Suddenly she starts quoting the Bible
and hobnobbing with the vicar.



- Why don't you have a car?
- To spare the environment.



Do you also try to save African children?



You should know that.
It's in the report.



Are we taking that?



- Were you planning to take the bus?
- Holy crap.



What the hell.



Hold onto the bike!



Yes, Harriet, the poor girl.
She came to a tragic end.



Do you remember what you talked about?



Why did she suddenly get
so interested in religion?



She wasn't a true believer.



Like many young people, Harriet
regarded God like a fashion accessory.



- She was a restless girl.
- She wrote these down.



- Do they make sense to you?
- Strange girl.



No, they seem completely random.



She didn't take anything seriously.
She was a little trouble-maker.



- Others say she was withdrawn.
- No, she was a lively girl.



Always looking for excitement.



Sweden wasn't big enough for her.



I expect that's why she moved abroad.



- Moved?
- Yes, to London.



- He's thinking of Anita.
- You've got it all mixed up, Dad.



No. She got cancer, poor girl.



They did look a bit alike,
and they were best friends.



Anita moved to London,
and she died of cancer a few years ago.



- You are thinking of Anita.
- That's right. Anita.



- That's what I said.
- It's OK, Dad.



Anita and Harriet were cousins,
and you knew both girls?



- We went to the same school.
- Was Harriet a religious person?



- No.
- How about after Gottfried's death?



She became more introvert,
but she wasn't a Christian.



You know... What if these quotes
don't have anything to do with God?



What if it's a code?



Sara Witt was found murdered
in her family's barn,



not far from Vilhelmina in 1962.



Sara? What else does it say?



"Between 2 and 3 a.m.,
the victim was lured ..."



"The woman's body was mutilated,
possibly from a religious ritual."



"The police won't disclose
anymore details."



Mutilated, possibly religious...
Did they find the killer?



No. The case was never solved.



- It's a long shot.
- I know.



- How far is it to Vilhelmina?
- Too far on a motorcycle.



What are we waiting for?



- You want to drive?
- Why?



- I haven't driven since my divorce.
- Then it's about time.



Funny how female names always
bring you to porn sites.



What are you doing?



I'm getting the computer to search
all the newspaper databases.



What was the name of the
journalist who wrote about Sara?



Witt? Gunnar Brännlund.



- Gunnar.
- Hi. Mikael.



Hi. Gunnar.



Let's go to the barn.



They couldn't sell the
farm after what happened.



It's been empty ever since.



This is where she was found?



Yes. Her husband found her.
It was horrific for him. Horrific.



She was lying right here.



In this stall.
Pinioned and tortured.



Were the animals also harmed?



How did you know?



Several cows had been mistreated.
A few even had to be put down.



- Anyone have a theory?
- No.



But they arrested a deviant who might
have been capable of such a crime.



- A deviant?
- He batted for the other team.



- You mean he was gay.
- Yes.



- But he wasn't convicted of the murder?
- No. Only of the other sordid stuff.



It was against the law back then.



And for good reason, if you ask me.



"If a woman approaches an animal
to have sexual relations with it,



kill both the woman and the animal."



- It might be a coincidence.
- Yes.



Holy shit, Lisbeth.



If the others also fit...



I've found an old TV guide.



A programme from 1999 about
a murder in Dalarna.



Go on.



"The series <i>Swedish Murders</i> looks
at the case of Magda Lovisa Sjöberg



from Dalarna."



Magda...



"A brutal murder puzzle from November
1954 that baffled the police."



Didn't we have a Magda reference?



Leviticus, Chapter 1, Verse 12.



"He is to cut it into pieces...
including the head and the fat."



"And the priest shall arrange them...
on the burning wood on the altar."



That was verbatim.



You quoted it word for word.



I think I've found another one,
a 17-year-old girl from Uppsala.



- Shit. When?
- 1964.



"Desperate search for witnesses."



"Mari's murder keeps locals indoors."



And our ratings were sky-high,
so we're planning another season.



New episodes showcasing old murder mysteries.



That's our host, Sally.



Let me see what I can find in the basement.



Thank you.



Sally?



You landed me with overtime.
I had to do some digging. Follow me.



As far as I know, Magda's body
was found after only six hours.



A farmer saw the smoke from the fire.



He thought it was some kids having a party.



Someone cut out fat from the body.



That's right. They found remains
of fat together with the head.



Awful.



- Thanks for your help.
- Let me know if there's anything else.



Actually, there is.



Could we have copies of this material?



Sure.



What the hell?
Relax!



I just wanted to wake you up.
We're here.



Can I come in?



Here's your bag.



Are you OK?



Yes, I'm OK.



I can't find anyone who fits the initials BJ.



But LI could be Liv Ingvartsson.



A prostitute who disappeared in Ånge
and was found on a building site.



What was that quote again?



"... she is to bring two doves
or two young pigeons,



one for a burnt offering
and the other for a sin offering."



"The priest will make atonement
for her, and she will be clean."



Ånge That's miles away in
the direction we came from.



There.



Now we've got Sara, Mari,
Magda and Liv. Four murders.



Now we only need BJ, who's been circled.



Harriet can't have known them.



Liv was murdered in 1949. Harriet was
born in 1950. What's the connection?



She makes a list of murdered
women and disappears.



- She must've known who the killer was.
- Yes.



- This is great stuff, Janne.
- Glad you like it.



But, remember, we can't publish a line
without solid sources.



- Can I have a word, Erika?
- Sure.



- Don't forget to call them.
- No.



- That's good, Janne.
- All right.



I've discovered that Janne
communicates with Wennerström.



How do you know this?



I checked his email.
I happened to see something.



He gets a copy of every communication
passing through our office.



Janne forwards Wennerström
everything where he's mentioned.



Janne.



So he's Wennerström's errand boy.



Fucking hell.



What will you do?



I've got to fire him ASAP.



Is that really the best option?



- What do you mean?
- I was thinking...



Isn't this a golden opportunity
to control what Wennerström knows?



Malin, what are you doing here at <i>Millennium</i>?



Huh? You're a politician.



Man, I could use a shower!



What is it?



Somebody's been here.



The pictures have been touched.



The Bible is pointing in the other direction.



- Look.
- What the hell?



Someone has been curious.



I'll buy a new lock tomorrow.



Lisbeth...
do you have a photographic memory?



I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to upset you.



It's fantastic if you do.
I wish that I had it.



Fuck, you scared me!



What is it?



What are you doing?



Are you sure it's a good idea?



- Are you leaving?
- Good night.



- Good morning.
- Good morning.



Did you sleep well?



- I'm updating Henrik. Want to come?
- I hate hospitals.



OK.



But that's...
That's totally absurd.



You've found out more than I'd hoped for.



- Your assistant, is she good?
- She's... good.



I'm sorry about checking up on you,
but I had to make sure



not to give the wrong person
access to my private business.



No worries.



Just concentrate on getting well.



- When will you be discharged?
- Not anytime soon.



But I'll get well, no matter how much
that will annoy the Vangers.



They've called a meeting
and you're at the top of the agenda.



- Me?
- Harriet's mother wants you to quit.



I'll continue... all the way.



I'll keep you updated.



Regarding the last reference...



- The last name.
- BJ.



Ask Morell if he can help you.



He wasn't thrilled about me.



He's just as obsessed about this case as I am.



Give him another chance.
He deserves it.



Morell! Morell!



I'll be damned!
Five murders!



- They weren't phone numbers.
- If it's any consolation,



it wasn't me who cracked it.
We need your help, Morell.



- Just ask.
- We can't find out who "BJ" was.



She's circled as if she's particularly
important. It's the last reference.



We'll get the local police
forces to check their records.



If there's a woman with these initials
who died in the '40s, '50s or '60s,



we've got to find her. Do the victims
have anything in common?



- Something significant to their killer?
- No, it seems random.



Apart from the passages and their gender.



Do you realise what this means?



If the first murder took place in 1949,



the man sending flowers must be very old.



It reduces the number of suspects considerably.



- Mikael. Nice of you to come. Welcome.
- Thank you.



- Harald couldn't make it. He's hunting.
- I see.



To what do I owe the honour?



Have you read the local paper recently?



- I've been out of town.
- That's right.



They're bringing out
quite an interesting serial



on your exile here on Hedeby.



BLOMKVIST'S NEW YOUNG GIRLFRIEND



OK...



VANGER INVESTS IN FAILING MAGAZINE



- And?
- You must realise we don't like it.



Henrik is dying, and there's
one scandal after another.



My private life has nothing to do
with my work for Henrik.



It does, if it affects
everybody in the Vanger Group.



Haven't you done enough harm?
You'll give Henrik a heart attack



by poking around in my daughter's death



and forcing him to invest
in your propaganda sheet.



Calm down, now. Mikael has simply
done what Henrik paid him to do.



- Maybe it's time to call it a day.
- What do you mean?



You're making matters worse
by coming here with your whore.



Mother, don't use that tone.



But maybe you should take a break now.
It's been a pretty hard deal.



- I'm needed here.
- And at <i>Millennium.</i>



What has <i>Millennium</i> got to do with it?



I'm standing in while Henrik is ill.



Henrik agreed to leave the
content solely up to us.



- Mikael, as your friend...
- Excuse me.



I'd like to make a comment.
Henrik signed a contract.



As long as he lives, it cannot be cancelled.



So whether Mikael likes it or not,
he has to continue.



I'm sorry that had to be so dramatic.



- Why do you wear Harriet's necklace?
- What do you mean?



Harriet was wearing it when she
disappeared. Now you're wearing it.



What are you trying to say?
Are you accusing me?



Just tell me where you got it from.



I inherited it from Anita.
It never belonged to Harriet.



Anita, your sister?



When you came here, I was relieved.



I thought it would be good with
some new blood in this hostile colony.



But you're just as bad.
You're as obsessed as Henrik!



<i>Micke.</i>



<i>Micke!</i>



<i>Everything all right?</i>



Anita is Harriet.
I was mistaken. It's not her.



What are you talking about?



They both looked after me that summer.
It's Anita's necklace.



Yes, it's Anita.
Shit, those two were so alike.



- What do we know about Anita Vanger?
- Cousin and Harriet's closest friend.



They were together each summer.
She had no alibi but wasn't a suspect.



Right after Harriet's death,
she moved to London to study.



She had a brilliant career but died
from breast cancer when she was 37.



She died 20 years ago.



She didn't tell Morell it
was her in the window.



- Maybe she had something to hide.
- Maybe to cover for the killer.



Yeah.



HI PLAGUE. PLS RUN CHECK
ON ANITA VANGER. WILL PAY...



- Plague?
- If there is anything, he'll find it.



- What happened?
- Some idiot shot at me.



Let me take a look.



- Did you see who?
- No. Damn.



Let's get you under a hot shower.



Shit.



We must be very close now.
And someone doesn't like it.



Give me my phone.
We have to call the police.



- What can they do?
- Go and get it.



- Then I'm out of here.
- Lisbeth!



- Let's not jump to any conclusions.
- Stop it.



- It could be a hunting accident.
- No.



- I'll get to the bottom of this.
- I hope so.



If it's not an accident, then you're not safe.



I think you should go home.
At least for a while.



Ever since I came here,
everyone wants me to leave.



Anything new on BJ?



We didn't find a BJ in the system.
But we'll keep on searching.



There are no bullets here.



No casing.
We can't find anything at all.



- What happened?
- I spent seven hours at the station.



They believe it's a hunting accident.



What's all this?



It's from Milton Security.
They sent it from Stockholm.



Two cameras outside and five inside,
connected to motion detectors.



I've got the whole place covered.



Fantastic.



You're not planning to leave, are you?



No, I'm not.



So now we've got it on tape?



Yes.
It's already on the Internet.



- What are you doing?
- Sorry?



- Go and sleep in your own bed.
- I want to be close to you.



OK, but I want to sleep.



What has happened to you?
How did you turn out this way?



You know everything about me.
I don't know shit about you.



Not a damn thing.



That's the way it is.



- Who is it?
- Morell.



I've found the last one.



Rebecka Jacobsson, nickname Bea.



BJ.



That's why we didn't find her.



"A man or a woman who is a medium
or a spiritist among you...



must be put to death.
You are to stone them."



It's her.



- Where was she killed?
- In Karlstad.



But that's not the interesting part.



Rebecka worked for the Vanger Group
until her death in January 1965.



As a secretary for Gottfried Vanger.



Gottfried died before
Harriet disappeared. So it wasn't him.



But we've got to check if she knew
other members of the Vanger family.



- Do you have the reports?
- Karlstad is sending them.



- Hold on.
- What?



Rebecka and Sara are Jewish names.



- Magda...
- Magdalena.



Mari, Maria. But Liv?



Liv means Eve. I bet
Liv Ingvartsson was Jewish as well.



Racist murders.
It fits the pseudo religious rituals.



But what about Harriet?



Harriet died because she discovered a pattern.



How the hell could we miss it?



They're Jewish names. There were
three Nazis in the Vanger family.



Only one was still alive when Harriet died.



Harald.



Who happened to be hunting
when you were running in the woods.



The first murder took place there in 1949.



Then Dalarna, Vilhelmina, Uppsala, Karlstad.



If Harald has been there, he's left traces.



- What do you mean?
- The accounts of the Vanger Group.



Business travels. There must be
evidence. Restaurant and hotel bills.



You think he got a tax deduction for murder?



Well, I know about businessmen.



Even if we can prove he's been
everywhere, it's not enough.



- Maybe he's hunting now.
- You suggest we break in?



We keep a staff of accountants in Hedestad.



Do you think they keep records that far back?



I think so.
May I ask what you're looking for?



I'd rather you didn't,
but we'll get back to you.



- I'll arrange it with Frode.
- Thanks.



Mikael.



I'm sorry about the meeting.
I didn't mean to be difficult.



But protecting the family
is an ingrained response.



No problem.



- How's your head?
- Fine, thanks.



Look after yourself.



We need to go back quite a few years.



89... 89...



We need the accounts from 1949 until 1966.



Thank Henrik for his old-fashioned
business practices.



Otherwise, they would've
been shredded long ago.



Well, it's all there.
Knock yourself out.



Miss Salander, what exactly
have you found so far?



Thank you, that was all.



IN THE NAME OF THE FÜHRER
I BESTOW...



What the hell are you doing here?
Answer me!



- Huh?
- Take it easy.



You're gonna write about me
in your damn communist magazine?



I'm leaving now. Don't shoot.



You broke into my home,
so I'm free to kill you.



What the hell is going on here?



- Freeze!
- Drop the gun, Harald.



- Come on, drop it.
- Stay out of it!



Drop the gun. Drop it.



Are you OK?



How the hell could Gottfried
have such a wuss of a son?



HARALD NO
MALMÖ



HARALD IMPOSSIBLE
HOTEL IN STOCKHOLM



HARALD NO
HAMBURG



Harald...



No.



No.



- We've got to call Morell.
- We can call him from my place.



Harald's not going anywhere.
Come on.



Gottfried?



Gottfried.



Uppsala 1964!



January, February...



April...



VANGER OFFICES IN SWEDEN



Wasn't there a group photo?



What the hell?



Can that be right?



Blue sweater.



What the fuck?



Shit.



Is it helping?



- He gave me a hell of a scare.
- You don't mess with Harald.



What were you doing in his house?



Harriet discovered a handful
of murders from the '40s to the '60s.



We know she found a pattern
the police didn't know about.



We believe that's why she was killed.



But that...
It sounds totally insane.



We've found a pattern regarding the victims.



They all had Jewish names.



Well, Harald isn't exactly
crazy about Abraham's kin.



No. So I went to his house
to see if I could find anything.



- And?
- What do I know?



He turned up so soon.



But he didn't exactly act all innocent.



No.



If Lisbeth can track down
his travel activities from the accounts,



we've got evidence against him.
Bills, invoices.



She's going through everything.



Very well. I'll call the police.



Try Morell.



What were you doing at Harald's?



There, there.



Scream as much as you want to, Mikael.
Scream as much as you can.



You think anyone'll hear you?



We both know how it's going to end for you.



Why?



Why what?



- All of this.
- Why not?



I'm doing what every man dreams of.
I take what I want.



How many women after the first?



I don't know.
I've lost count.



I had a girl in that cage
when we were dining upstairs.



Those kinds of women disappear
all the time. Nobody misses them.



Whores, immigrants.



Fucking hell.



What do you do with them?



What about the references, the mutilations...



That was my father's project. He mixed
his hobby with race and religion.



But it was a mistake.
You shouldn't leave the bodies behind.



I take them for a trip in my boat
and then I drop them in the sea.



Mikael?



Mari was my first.



'64.



You were 16 years old.



It was Dad, Gottfried, who taught me
how I should strangle her.



It's sick.



It's mainly for the sex.



When I put them down, it's only
a logical consequence of the rape.



You can't leave any witnesses.



Even though I have to admit
I love seeing their disappointment.



- Disappointment?
- They don't realise that they'll die.



It doesn't really fit into
their scheme of things.



They always think I'll show them mercy.



It's a fantastic moment...



when they realise
they're not getting away.



When the eyes...



switch off and die.



You'll experience that yourself.



And your sister? What did it feel like
when your sister's eyes died?



- Harriet disappeared.
- You want me to believe that?



Believe what the hell you want to.



I would have enjoyed killing her.
But she disappeared.



Just like you'll disappear.



Do you want some water?



Sure.



Thanks.



You see...
you're just like everybody else.



It only takes a simple human gesture
to ignite a small hope



that I might let you go after all.



Right?



Take it easy.
It'll be quick.



I'm mostly looking forward
to your little girlfriend.



Come on, you little cunt.



Are you OK?



Fuck!



I can't...



I can't...



I can't move.



I can't move.



Help me.



Please help me.



- Where's Martin?
- He's not coming back.



What do you mean?



He drove to his death.



- He's finished.
- Are you positive?



What the hell did you do?



He died in a car accident.
We don't know anything. OK?



Blomkvist!



- What the hell happened here?
- The cellar.



What happened out there?



He didn't die in an accident, did he?



Damn it, Lisbeth.



His father taught him to kill
when he was 16 years old.



That would make anybody sick in the brain.



Don't make him into a fucking victim.
He nearly killed you.



He was a killer and a rapist,
and he enjoyed it.



He had the same chances as everyone
else. You choose who you want to be.



He wasn't a victim. He was
an evil motherfucker who hated women.



How did he die?



He burned to death.



- Could you have saved him?
- Yes.



- But you let him burn.
- Yes.



I would never have done that, Lisbeth.



But I understand why you did it.



I don't know what you've been through.



But I almost died in that cellar...



and you saved my life.



Whatever it is you've been through,



you don't have to tell me.



I'm just glad you're here.



Thanks.



For the first time in my life I feel old.



Well... What do we do now?



We'll have to identify all the victims.



Notify their next of kin.



Get in touch with the ones we can find
and tell them what happened.



How can one ever make it up to them?



By providing some kind
of financial compensation? No.



Well, Mikael, it's the story of the decade.



You've got your work cut out for you
while you're in prison.



It's a good story.



But I'm not going to write about it.



I don't know how to thank you.



You solved a mystery that occupied
far too many years of my life.



Well, it was my very first case.



How fitting that it would be my last.



We're not finished yet.



What do you mean?



Harriet wasn't one of Martin's victims.



What are you saying?



Martin didn't kill Harriet.



Lisbeth?



Lisbeth?



THERE ARE TWO ANITA VANGERS.
ONE OF THEM DIED IN LONDON.



THE OTHER ONE LIVES IN AUSTRALIA.
FIRST ENTRY INTO THE COUNTRY IN 1966.



Harriet?



Harriet Vanger?



Harriet Vanger?



Yes. You and your cousin babysat me
when I was a small boy.



But I'm here on behalf of Henrik Vanger.



Does he know I'm alive?



Not yet.



Is this to do with my brother's
death in a car accident?



- How did you know that?
- We do have Internet access here.



Your brother did this.



He nearly killed me.



It doesn't surprise me.



I'm here to visit Agneta Salander.



- Who can I say it is?
- Her daughter.



Her daughter?
Are you Agneta's daughter?



I'm sorry, it's just...
I've never seen you before.



A visitor for Agneta Salander.



OK.



Room 314.



Hi, Mum.



Mum?



It's me. Lisbeth.



Lisbeth...



Are you Lisbeth?



I wanted to come a long time ago.



You look so different now.



- Do you have kids?
- No.



A boyfriend?



There is someone...



but you should never fall in love.



You know that better than anyone.



Right, Mum?



I should have picked a better father for you.



Mum...
It was you he harmed.



Mum...



Come in.



Mikael. Welcome back.



I've got a nice surprise. Promise me
you won't have a heart attack.



With all the pills I'm popping at the moment,



I think it's physically impossible
to have a heart attack.



Harriet?



Forgive me.



I'm sorry.



I'm sorry.



I was 14 when Dad raped me for the first time.



A year later he took me to his cottage.



Then Martin joined in.



They abused me again several times after that.



One day I'd had enough.



<i>Dad was drunk as usual.</i>



<i>He reeled off Bible verses and boasted
about all the women he'd killed.</i>



I took the oar and hit him hard.



<i>I forced him underwater until
the surface became still.</i>



Then I pushed the boat out
to make it look like an accident.



<i>But when I turned around...</i>



<i>Martin was there.</i>



<i>Martin treated me even worse than Gottfried.</i>



<i>You sent him to a boarding school in Uppsala,</i>



<i>but on Children's Day he came back.</i>



<i>I was terrified it would start all over again.</i>



And then you went to Anita?



Anita helped me out of here.



When the bridge was opened, she drove the car.



I was in the back seat under a blanket.



I've been thinking of you all these years.



I sent you the framed flowers...



because I wanted to tell you
that I was out there somewhere.



So I was sad to hear Mikael tell me
what you'd read into them.



If you hadn't sent them,
you wouldn't be sitting here now.



No.



Lisbeth, it's me again.



Call me if you get this.



I hope you're all right.
Call me.



You've got a visitor.



Thirty minutes.



I'm so happy to see you.



Here.



- What's this?
- A bit of reading.



- Don't you want to sit down?
- I just wanted to give you that.



I've only got one and a half months left.



EVERYBODY'S GOT SECRETS



WENNERSTRÖM'S EMPIRE RESEMBLES
A LIVING, BREATHING ORGANISM...



<i>Reporter Mikael Blomkvist,
who's served a sentence</i>



<i>for libelling
the tycoon Hans-Erik Wennerström,</i>



<i>now accuses Wennerström again.</i>



<i>In the magazine</i> Millennium,



<i>Blomkvist accuses Wennerström
of using his companies</i>



<i>to commit serious financial crimes.</i>



- Why are you going after him again?
- It makes you wonder.



- What will happen to Wennerström?
- There's an empty cell now.



<i>It's a tangled web, where the value
of Wennerström Group holdings</i>



<i>has been inflated by investments
in fictitious "mailbox firms".</i>



<i>Blomkvist describes an empire
founded on phoney options, accounts,</i>



<i>loan guarantees and foreign
exchange transactions.</i>



Millennium <i>also reveals that</i>
<i>the group supports Third World cartels,</i>



<i>cartels that are involved
in drug trafficking and gunrunning.</i>



Janne.



<i>And a member of the</i> Millennium <i>staff</i>
<i>has been on the group's payroll,</i>



<i>feeding them with information and
undermining the publication's efforts.</i>



<i>This is the latest of many
shocking developments...</i>



Really special.



There he is!



Micke! Micke! Micke!



- Cheers!
- Cheers!



<i>The wanted tycoon Wennerström</i>



<i>was found dead this morning
in an apartment in Marbella, Spain.</i>



<i>A cleaning lady found
the 44-year-old tycoon.</i>



<i>According to the police, it was suicide.</i>



<i>There's no suspicion of a crime.</i>



<i>Yet another interesting turn of events
in the Wennerström case.</i>



<i>When the police examined
all of Wennerström's bank accounts,</i>



<i>it appeared that a large sum has been withdrawn</i>



<i>from an account in the Cayman Islands.</i>



<i>Several million Swedish
kroner have been withdrawn.</i>



<i>Police are now investigating
an unidentified woman</i>



<i>who was caught by a surveillance camera.</i>



Lisbeth.
