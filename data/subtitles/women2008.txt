1
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,834
<i>The accused is sentenced
to three months in jail.</i>

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,212
- We have to find a way.
- It's empty in here.

3
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:39,798
What can you tell me about Blomkvist?

4
00:00:39,966 --> 00:00:41,341
I think he was set up.

5
00:00:41,509 --> 00:00:43,469
Henrik Vanger from the Vanger Group?

6
00:00:43,636 --> 00:00:47,097
It's Harriet Vanger.
She used to babysit you.

7
00:00:47,265 --> 00:00:49,267
- Who sends them to you?
- Harriet's killer.

8
00:00:49,433 --> 00:00:51,018
You don't know my family.

9
00:00:51,185 --> 00:00:53,813
One of them killed Harriet.

10
00:00:53,979 --> 00:00:57,524
Look at the window.
That's the last picture of Harriet.

11
00:00:57,692 --> 00:00:59,694
So now you're working for the big capitalists?

12
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:03,323
Give it up before you become obsessed
yourself. There is no answer.

13
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:06,367
- What is she looking at?
- Her killer.

14
00:01:07,034 --> 00:01:09,329
- What are you up to?
- Henrik will invest in <i>Millennium.</i>

15
00:01:11,914 --> 00:01:13,370
If you give me
any kind of trouble,

16
00:01:13,471 --> 00:01:16,001
I'll make sure you spend the
rest of your life in a closed ward.

17
00:01:16,168 --> 00:01:19,796
I know all about your mental problems
and your violent background.

18
00:01:19,963 --> 00:01:21,215
Are you a good girl?

19
00:01:23,134 --> 00:01:25,093
- Lisbeth Salander?
- Who are you?

20
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,304
Give it a rest.

21
00:01:26,471 --> 00:01:28,430
How much do you know about my assignment?

22
00:01:28,597 --> 00:01:30,849
It's a 40-year-old murder
of a 16-year-old girl.

23
00:01:31,016 --> 00:01:32,060
I need your help.

24
00:01:37,606 --> 00:01:40,984
PART 2

25
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:10,824
THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO

26
00:04:04,127 --> 00:04:06,087
Welcome.

27
00:04:06,254 --> 00:04:07,423
Yes...

28
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:11,885
Yes...

29
00:04:14,472 --> 00:04:16,766
So he'll live?

30
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:23,898
Can I visit him?

31
00:04:26,192 --> 00:04:28,694
Lisbeth Salander's here.

32
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:34,074
Yes.

33
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:38,995
OK, Frode.
Talk to you soon. Thanks.

34
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:58,807
IF A WOMAN APPROACHES AN ANIMAL
TO HAVE SEXUAL RELATIONS...

35
00:05:00,725 --> 00:05:04,646
As we've been sharing files lately,
I assume you're up to date.

36
00:05:06,023 --> 00:05:07,608
Yes.

37
00:05:13,572 --> 00:05:16,324
Everyone here is a suspect.

38
00:05:17,326 --> 00:05:20,204
They were all on the island
when Harriet disappeared,

39
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:23,874
except for Richard and Gottfried,
who were dead.

40
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:28,545
We know that she's afraid of someone
on the other side of the street.

41
00:05:28,713 --> 00:05:32,341
Bible passages, blood and death.

42
00:05:32,507 --> 00:05:35,261
Brutal content in a girl's diary.

43
00:05:35,427 --> 00:05:38,680
The day she disappeared,
Harriet talked to the local vicar,

44
00:05:38,848 --> 00:05:42,393
Otto Falk.
We know that they used to meet.

45
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:48,024
Harriet was 16
and came from a non-religious family.

46
00:05:48,189 --> 00:05:53,278
Suddenly she starts quoting the Bible
and hobnobbing with the vicar.

47
00:05:56,115 --> 00:05:58,951
- Why don't you have a car?
- To spare the environment.

48
00:05:59,117 --> 00:06:00,995
Do you also try to save African children?

49
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:04,540
You should know that.
It's in the report.

50
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:08,418
Are we taking that?

51
00:06:14,716 --> 00:06:18,220
- Were you planning to take the bus?
- Holy crap.

52
00:06:20,473 --> 00:06:22,557
What the hell.

53
00:06:24,601 --> 00:06:26,312
Hold onto the bike!

54
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:49,918
Yes, Harriet, the poor girl.
She came to a tragic end.

55
00:06:50,086 --> 00:06:52,338
Do you remember what you talked about?

56
00:06:52,504 --> 00:06:55,716
Why did she suddenly get
so interested in religion?

57
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:59,762
She wasn't a true believer.

58
00:06:59,928 --> 00:07:05,892
Like many young people, Harriet
regarded God like a fashion accessory.

59
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:09,689
- She was a restless girl.
- She wrote these down.

60
00:07:09,855 --> 00:07:14,067
- Do they make sense to you?
- Strange girl.

61
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:19,740
No, they seem completely random.

62
00:07:20,658 --> 00:07:26,372
She didn't take anything seriously.
She was a little trouble-maker.

63
00:07:26,538 --> 00:07:32,545
- Others say she was withdrawn.
- No, she was a lively girl.

64
00:07:32,711 --> 00:07:35,338
Always looking for excitement.

65
00:07:36,548 --> 00:07:39,218
Sweden wasn't big enough for her.

66
00:07:40,261 --> 00:07:43,596
I expect that's why she moved abroad.

67
00:07:43,764 --> 00:07:45,891
- Moved?
- Yes, to London.

68
00:07:46,057 --> 00:07:50,396
- He's thinking of Anita.
- You've got it all mixed up, Dad.

69
00:07:50,562 --> 00:07:53,064
No. She got cancer, poor girl.

70
00:07:53,231 --> 00:07:58,028
They did look a bit alike,
and they were best friends.

71
00:07:58,194 --> 00:08:01,574
Anita moved to London,
and she died of cancer a few years ago.

72
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:06,120
- You are thinking of Anita.
- That's right. Anita.

73
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:10,624
- That's what I said.
- It's OK, Dad.

74
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:14,127
Anita and Harriet were cousins,
and you knew both girls?

75
00:08:14,295 --> 00:08:17,630
- We went to the same school.
- Was Harriet a religious person?

76
00:08:17,798 --> 00:08:20,800
- No.
- How about after Gottfried's death?

77
00:08:20,968 --> 00:08:26,932
She became more introvert,
but she wasn't a Christian.

78
00:08:32,687 --> 00:08:37,610
You know... What if these quotes
don't have anything to do with God?

79
00:08:37,777 --> 00:08:40,361
What if it's a code?

80
00:08:40,528 --> 00:08:43,698
Sara Witt was found murdered
in her family's barn,

81
00:08:43,865 --> 00:08:46,994
not far from Vilhelmina in 1962.

82
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:49,913
Sara? What else does it say?

83
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,793
"Between 2 and 3 a.m.,
the victim was lured ..."

84
00:08:56,711 --> 00:09:01,549
"The woman's body was mutilated,
possibly from a religious ritual."

85
00:09:01,716 --> 00:09:04,345
"The police won't disclose
anymore details."

86
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:08,765
Mutilated, possibly religious...
Did they find the killer?

87
00:09:12,186 --> 00:09:14,813
No. The case was never solved.

88
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:21,320
- It's a long shot.
- I know.

89
00:09:22,238 --> 00:09:26,616
- How far is it to Vilhelmina?
- Too far on a motorcycle.

90
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,596
What are we waiting for?

91
00:09:48,764 --> 00:09:51,182
- You want to drive?
- Why?

92
00:09:52,768 --> 00:09:57,523
- I haven't driven since my divorce.
- Then it's about time.

93
00:10:27,344 --> 00:10:30,471
Funny how female names always
bring you to porn sites.

94
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:32,682
What are you doing?

95
00:10:34,225 --> 00:10:38,438
I'm getting the computer to search
all the newspaper databases.

96
00:11:02,254 --> 00:11:06,258
What was the name of the
journalist who wrote about Sara?

97
00:11:06,424 --> 00:11:09,427
Witt? Gunnar Brännlund.

98
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:26,278
- Gunnar.
- Hi. Mikael.

99
00:11:26,445 --> 00:11:27,988
Hi. Gunnar.

100
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:30,950
Let's go to the barn.

101
00:11:34,244 --> 00:11:37,373
They couldn't sell the
farm after what happened.

102
00:11:37,538 --> 00:11:40,584
It's been empty ever since.

103
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:48,634
This is where she was found?

104
00:11:48,801 --> 00:11:53,846
Yes. Her husband found her.
It was horrific for him. Horrific.

105
00:11:56,225 --> 00:11:58,268
She was lying right here.

106
00:12:01,062 --> 00:12:06,485
In this stall.
Pinioned and tortured.

107
00:12:16,412 --> 00:12:18,956
Were the animals also harmed?

108
00:12:19,999 --> 00:12:22,375
How did you know?

109
00:12:24,128 --> 00:12:31,051
Several cows had been mistreated.
A few even had to be put down.

110
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:33,928
- Anyone have a theory?
- No.

111
00:12:34,096 --> 00:12:38,182
But they arrested a deviant who might
have been capable of such a crime.

112
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:42,187
- A deviant?
- He batted for the other team.

113
00:12:42,354 --> 00:12:44,981
- You mean he was gay.
- Yes.

114
00:12:45,149 --> 00:12:49,695
- But he wasn't convicted of the murder?
- No. Only of the other sordid stuff.

115
00:12:49,861 --> 00:12:52,614
It was against the law back then.

116
00:12:53,907 --> 00:12:57,119
And for good reason, if you ask me.

117
00:12:59,663 --> 00:13:03,082
"If a woman approaches an animal
to have sexual relations with it,

118
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,753
kill both the woman and the animal."

119
00:13:08,964 --> 00:13:12,091
- It might be a coincidence.
- Yes.

120
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:19,475
Holy shit, Lisbeth.

121
00:13:21,184 --> 00:13:23,937
If the others also fit...

122
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:39,411
I've found an old TV guide.

123
00:13:42,748 --> 00:13:46,293
A programme from 1999 about
a murder in Dalarna.

124
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,543
Go on.

125
00:13:47,711 --> 00:13:51,631
"The series <i>Swedish Murders</i> looks
at the case of Magda Lovisa Sjöberg

126
00:13:51,798 --> 00:13:53,466
from Dalarna."

127
00:13:54,802 --> 00:13:56,677
Magda...

128
00:13:56,845 --> 00:14:01,140
"A brutal murder puzzle from November
1954 that baffled the police."

129
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:03,811
Didn't we have a Magda reference?

130
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:06,730
Leviticus, Chapter 1, Verse 12.

131
00:14:06,897 --> 00:14:09,982
"He is to cut it into pieces...
including the head and the fat."

132
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:14,278
"And the priest shall arrange them...
on the burning wood on the altar."

133
00:14:15,364 --> 00:14:17,407
That was verbatim.

134
00:14:19,993 --> 00:14:22,453
You quoted it word for word.

135
00:14:46,687 --> 00:14:50,774
I think I've found another one,
a 17-year-old girl from Uppsala.

136
00:14:52,275 --> 00:14:56,529
- Shit. When?
- 1964.

137
00:15:00,741 --> 00:15:03,995
"Desperate search for witnesses."

138
00:15:06,164 --> 00:15:08,500
"Mari's murder keeps locals indoors."

139
00:15:55,213 --> 00:16:00,427
And our ratings were sky-high,
so we're planning another season.

140
00:16:00,594 --> 00:16:04,014
New episodes showcasing old murder mysteries.

141
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:09,061
That's our host, Sally.

142
00:16:14,441 --> 00:16:17,068
Let me see what I can find in the basement.

143
00:16:17,235 --> 00:16:18,861
Thank you.

144
00:16:22,407 --> 00:16:24,659
Sally?

145
00:16:32,918 --> 00:16:38,548
You landed me with overtime.
I had to do some digging. Follow me.

146
00:16:50,686 --> 00:16:55,315
As far as I know, Magda's body
was found after only six hours.

147
00:16:56,357 --> 00:16:59,110
A farmer saw the smoke from the fire.

148
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:02,614
He thought it was some kids having a party.

149
00:17:04,407 --> 00:17:07,035
Someone cut out fat from the body.

150
00:17:09,663 --> 00:17:15,711
That's right. They found remains
of fat together with the head.

151
00:17:16,836 --> 00:17:19,047
Awful.

152
00:17:21,717 --> 00:17:26,762
- Thanks for your help.
- Let me know if there's anything else.

153
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:29,057
Actually, there is.

154
00:17:30,224 --> 00:17:32,728
Could we have copies of this material?

155
00:17:37,273 --> 00:17:38,900
Sure.

156
00:18:18,022 --> 00:18:20,025
What the hell?
Relax!

157
00:18:21,692 --> 00:18:24,820
I just wanted to wake you up.
We're here.

158
00:18:40,378 --> 00:18:42,172
Can I come in?

159
00:18:45,967 --> 00:18:47,635
Here's your bag.

160
00:18:54,726 --> 00:18:56,228
Are you OK?

161
00:18:58,063 --> 00:18:59,940
Yes, I'm OK.

162
00:19:35,182 --> 00:19:38,019
I can't find anyone who fits the initials BJ.

163
00:19:39,229 --> 00:19:42,898
But LI could be Liv Ingvartsson.

164
00:19:43,066 --> 00:19:47,112
A prostitute who disappeared in Ånge
and was found on a building site.

165
00:19:47,278 --> 00:19:48,947
What was that quote again?

166
00:19:49,114 --> 00:19:51,365
"... she is to bring two doves
or two young pigeons,

167
00:19:51,532 --> 00:19:53,868
one for a burnt offering
and the other for a sin offering."

168
00:19:54,035 --> 00:19:56,997
"The priest will make atonement
for her, and she will be clean."

169
00:19:57,163 --> 00:20:01,084
Ånge That's miles away in
the direction we came from.

170
00:20:24,023 --> 00:20:25,650
There.

171
00:20:27,943 --> 00:20:32,365
Now we've got Sara, Mari,
Magda and Liv. Four murders.

172
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:35,743
Now we only need BJ, who's been circled.

173
00:20:35,911 --> 00:20:38,121
Harriet can't have known them.

174
00:20:38,288 --> 00:20:44,294
Liv was murdered in 1949. Harriet was
born in 1950. What's the connection?

175
00:20:45,503 --> 00:20:48,507
She makes a list of murdered
women and disappears.

176
00:20:48,673 --> 00:20:52,426
- She must've known who the killer was.
- Yes.

177
00:21:01,353 --> 00:21:03,771
- This is great stuff, Janne.
- Glad you like it.

178
00:21:03,939 --> 00:21:08,734
But, remember, we can't publish a line
without solid sources.

179
00:21:10,487 --> 00:21:12,905
- Can I have a word, Erika?
- Sure.

180
00:21:13,073 --> 00:21:15,032
- Don't forget to call them.
- No.

181
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,036
- That's good, Janne.
- All right.

182
00:21:20,997 --> 00:21:24,709
I've discovered that Janne
communicates with Wennerström.

183
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:29,673
How do you know this?

184
00:21:30,548 --> 00:21:34,009
I checked his email.
I happened to see something.

185
00:21:34,176 --> 00:21:40,307
He gets a copy of every communication
passing through our office.

186
00:21:41,934 --> 00:21:46,439
Janne forwards Wennerström
everything where he's mentioned.

187
00:21:51,111 --> 00:21:53,028
Janne.

188
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:57,450
So he's Wennerström's errand boy.

189
00:21:58,867 --> 00:22:00,912
Fucking hell.

190
00:22:02,038 --> 00:22:04,540
What will you do?

191
00:22:07,419 --> 00:22:10,171
I've got to fire him ASAP.

192
00:22:11,423 --> 00:22:13,508
Is that really the best option?

193
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:18,555
- What do you mean?
- I was thinking...

194
00:22:18,721 --> 00:22:23,518
Isn't this a golden opportunity
to control what Wennerström knows?

195
00:22:30,858 --> 00:22:33,403
Malin, what are you doing here at <i>Millennium</i>?

196
00:22:34,528 --> 00:22:37,406
Huh? You're a politician.

197
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,984
Man, I could use a shower!

198
00:23:15,487 --> 00:23:17,029
What is it?

199
00:23:18,198 --> 00:23:20,282
Somebody's been here.

200
00:23:23,369 --> 00:23:25,872
The pictures have been touched.

201
00:23:27,082 --> 00:23:29,209
The Bible is pointing in the other direction.

202
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,797
- Look.
- What the hell?

203
00:23:33,962 --> 00:23:38,050
Someone has been curious.

204
00:23:49,479 --> 00:23:51,772
I'll buy a new lock tomorrow.

205
00:24:04,993 --> 00:24:08,288
Lisbeth...
do you have a photographic memory?

206
00:24:29,144 --> 00:24:32,271
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to upset you.

207
00:24:32,439 --> 00:24:36,608
It's fantastic if you do.
I wish that I had it.

208
00:25:12,186 --> 00:25:15,064
Fuck, you scared me!

209
00:25:16,441 --> 00:25:18,026
What is it?

210
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,201
What are you doing?

211
00:25:43,801 --> 00:25:46,011
Are you sure it's a good idea?

212
00:26:38,815 --> 00:26:41,733
- Are you leaving?
- Good night.

213
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:04,840
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

214
00:27:28,071 --> 00:27:30,157
Did you sleep well?

215
00:27:43,922 --> 00:27:48,175
- I'm updating Henrik. Want to come?
- I hate hospitals.

216
00:27:50,636 --> 00:27:52,512
OK.

217
00:28:00,104 --> 00:28:03,566
But that's...
That's totally absurd.

218
00:28:05,401 --> 00:28:09,446
You've found out more than I'd hoped for.

219
00:28:09,614 --> 00:28:16,203
- Your assistant, is she good?
- She's... good.

220
00:28:16,371 --> 00:28:19,958
I'm sorry about checking up on you,
but I had to make sure

221
00:28:20,124 --> 00:28:23,294
not to give the wrong person
access to my private business.

222
00:28:23,461 --> 00:28:25,421
No worries.

223
00:28:27,464 --> 00:28:30,218
Just concentrate on getting well.

224
00:28:33,261 --> 00:28:37,432
- When will you be discharged?
- Not anytime soon.

225
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:42,105
But I'll get well, no matter how much
that will annoy the Vangers.

226
00:28:44,106 --> 00:28:48,277
They've called a meeting
and you're at the top of the agenda.

227
00:28:48,443 --> 00:28:52,615
- Me?
- Harriet's mother wants you to quit.

228
00:28:54,366 --> 00:28:56,536
I'll continue... all the way.

229
00:28:56,702 --> 00:28:59,247
I'll keep you updated.

230
00:28:59,413 --> 00:29:02,000
Regarding the last reference...

231
00:29:02,165 --> 00:29:04,460
- The last name.
- BJ.

232
00:29:04,626 --> 00:29:07,255
Ask Morell if he can help you.

233
00:29:07,422 --> 00:29:09,798
He wasn't thrilled about me.

234
00:29:09,965 --> 00:29:13,469
He's just as obsessed about this case as I am.

235
00:29:13,635 --> 00:29:16,013
Give him another chance.
He deserves it.

236
00:29:28,108 --> 00:29:31,028
Morell! Morell!

237
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:40,078
I'll be damned!
Five murders!

238
00:29:42,457 --> 00:29:45,667
- They weren't phone numbers.
- If it's any consolation,

239
00:29:45,835 --> 00:29:49,797
it wasn't me who cracked it.
We need your help, Morell.

240
00:29:49,963 --> 00:29:54,093
- Just ask.
- We can't find out who "BJ" was.

241
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:58,221
She's circled as if she's particularly
important. It's the last reference.

242
00:29:58,388 --> 00:30:02,894
We'll get the local police
forces to check their records.

243
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:08,356
If there's a woman with these initials
who died in the '40s, '50s or '60s,

244
00:30:08,523 --> 00:30:13,653
we've got to find her. Do the victims
have anything in common?

245
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:17,282
- Something significant to their killer?
- No, it seems random.

246
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:20,619
Apart from the passages and their gender.

247
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:25,875
Do you realise what this means?

248
00:30:26,041 --> 00:30:28,461
If the first murder took place in 1949,

249
00:30:28,627 --> 00:30:31,963
the man sending flowers must be very old.

250
00:30:32,131 --> 00:30:35,634
It reduces the number of suspects considerably.

251
00:31:02,994 --> 00:31:07,666
- Mikael. Nice of you to come. Welcome.
- Thank you.

252
00:31:07,834 --> 00:31:11,921
- Harald couldn't make it. He's hunting.
- I see.

253
00:31:14,714 --> 00:31:16,592
To what do I owe the honour?

254
00:31:16,759 --> 00:31:20,221
Have you read the local paper recently?

255
00:31:20,387 --> 00:31:22,640
- I've been out of town.
- That's right.

256
00:31:22,807 --> 00:31:27,353
They're bringing out
quite an interesting serial

257
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,980
on your exile here on Hedeby.

258
00:31:30,147 --> 00:31:33,233
BLOMKVIST'S NEW YOUNG GIRLFRIEND

259
00:31:34,277 --> 00:31:35,318
OK...

260
00:31:35,486 --> 00:31:38,114
VANGER INVESTS IN FAILING MAGAZINE

261
00:31:38,573 --> 00:31:42,576
- And?
- You must realise we don't like it.

262
00:31:42,742 --> 00:31:47,707
Henrik is dying, and there's
one scandal after another.

263
00:31:47,874 --> 00:31:51,501
My private life has nothing to do
with my work for Henrik.

264
00:31:51,669 --> 00:31:55,839
It does, if it affects
everybody in the Vanger Group.

265
00:31:56,007 --> 00:32:00,094
Haven't you done enough harm?
You'll give Henrik a heart attack

266
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:03,013
by poking around in my daughter's death

267
00:32:03,181 --> 00:32:06,851
and forcing him to invest
in your propaganda sheet.

268
00:32:07,018 --> 00:32:13,273
Calm down, now. Mikael has simply
done what Henrik paid him to do.

269
00:32:14,107 --> 00:32:18,653
- Maybe it's time to call it a day.
- What do you mean?

270
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:22,575
You're making matters worse
by coming here with your whore.

271
00:32:22,741 --> 00:32:24,701
Mother, don't use that tone.

272
00:32:24,868 --> 00:32:29,957
But maybe you should take a break now.
It's been a pretty hard deal.

273
00:32:31,875 --> 00:32:35,462
- I'm needed here.
- And at <i>Millennium.</i>

274
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:38,007
What has <i>Millennium</i> got to do with it?

275
00:32:38,173 --> 00:32:41,509
I'm standing in while Henrik is ill.

276
00:32:41,676 --> 00:32:46,097
Henrik agreed to leave the
content solely up to us.

277
00:32:46,265 --> 00:32:48,601
- Mikael, as your friend...
- Excuse me.

278
00:32:48,768 --> 00:32:54,815
I'd like to make a comment.
Henrik signed a contract.

279
00:32:55,607 --> 00:32:59,653
As long as he lives, it cannot be cancelled.

280
00:32:59,819 --> 00:33:04,407
So whether Mikael likes it or not,
he has to continue.

281
00:33:19,382 --> 00:33:22,884
I'm sorry that had to be so dramatic.

282
00:33:23,051 --> 00:33:26,763
- Why do you wear Harriet's necklace?
- What do you mean?

283
00:33:27,807 --> 00:33:31,559
Harriet was wearing it when she
disappeared. Now you're wearing it.

284
00:33:31,727 --> 00:33:34,896
What are you trying to say?
Are you accusing me?

285
00:33:36,273 --> 00:33:38,567
Just tell me where you got it from.

286
00:33:38,733 --> 00:33:43,530
I inherited it from Anita.
It never belonged to Harriet.

287
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,746
Anita, your sister?

288
00:33:50,913 --> 00:33:53,374
When you came here, I was relieved.

289
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:58,170
I thought it would be good with
some new blood in this hostile colony.

290
00:33:58,336 --> 00:34:02,633
But you're just as bad.
You're as obsessed as Henrik!

291
00:34:13,268 --> 00:34:14,686
<i>Micke.</i>

292
00:34:15,896 --> 00:34:17,606
<i>Micke!</i>

293
00:34:20,233 --> 00:34:22,652
<i>Everything all right?</i>

294
00:34:53,309 --> 00:34:56,353
Anita is Harriet.
I was mistaken. It's not her.

295
00:34:56,519 --> 00:34:58,396
What are you talking about?

296
00:34:58,563 --> 00:35:02,400
They both looked after me that summer.
It's Anita's necklace.

297
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:16,123
Yes, it's Anita.
Shit, those two were so alike.

298
00:35:16,289 --> 00:35:20,378
- What do we know about Anita Vanger?
- Cousin and Harriet's closest friend.

299
00:35:20,543 --> 00:35:24,340
They were together each summer.
She had no alibi but wasn't a suspect.

300
00:35:24,507 --> 00:35:27,760
Right after Harriet's death,
she moved to London to study.

301
00:35:27,927 --> 00:35:32,181
She had a brilliant career but died
from breast cancer when she was 37.

302
00:35:32,347 --> 00:35:34,516
She died 20 years ago.

303
00:35:35,684 --> 00:35:37,936
She didn't tell Morell it
was her in the window.

304
00:35:38,103 --> 00:35:42,273
- Maybe she had something to hide.
- Maybe to cover for the killer.

305
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,068
Yeah.

306
00:35:52,576 --> 00:35:56,079
HI PLAGUE. PLS RUN CHECK
ON ANITA VANGER. WILL PAY...

307
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:04,045
- Plague?
- If there is anything, he'll find it.

308
00:37:42,018 --> 00:37:45,313
- What happened?
- Some idiot shot at me.

309
00:37:47,775 --> 00:37:50,318
Let me take a look.

310
00:37:55,699 --> 00:37:59,202
- Did you see who?
- No. Damn.

311
00:38:00,579 --> 00:38:02,664
Let's get you under a hot shower.

312
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,835
Shit.

313
00:38:10,922 --> 00:38:14,717
We must be very close now.
And someone doesn't like it.

314
00:38:14,885 --> 00:38:17,679
Give me my phone.
We have to call the police.

315
00:38:17,846 --> 00:38:20,306
- What can they do?
- Go and get it.

316
00:38:20,474 --> 00:38:22,601
- Then I'm out of here.
- Lisbeth!

317
00:38:29,942 --> 00:38:33,403
- Let's not jump to any conclusions.
- Stop it.

318
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:37,157
- It could be a hunting accident.
- No.

319
00:38:37,324 --> 00:38:41,244
- I'll get to the bottom of this.
- I hope so.

320
00:38:42,161 --> 00:38:44,623
If it's not an accident, then you're not safe.

321
00:38:47,208 --> 00:38:50,795
I think you should go home.
At least for a while.

322
00:38:52,047 --> 00:38:55,300
Ever since I came here,
everyone wants me to leave.

323
00:38:58,304 --> 00:39:00,389
Anything new on BJ?

324
00:39:00,556 --> 00:39:06,186
We didn't find a BJ in the system.
But we'll keep on searching.

325
00:39:06,353 --> 00:39:08,688
There are no bullets here.

326
00:39:08,856 --> 00:39:13,402
No casing.
We can't find anything at all.

327
00:39:33,463 --> 00:39:37,467
- What happened?
- I spent seven hours at the station.

328
00:39:37,635 --> 00:39:40,387
They believe it's a hunting accident.

329
00:39:45,224 --> 00:39:46,851
What's all this?

330
00:39:47,018 --> 00:39:51,148
It's from Milton Security.
They sent it from Stockholm.

331
00:39:51,315 --> 00:39:55,152
Two cameras outside and five inside,
connected to motion detectors.

332
00:39:55,318 --> 00:39:57,112
I've got the whole place covered.

333
00:40:00,199 --> 00:40:02,159
Fantastic.

334
00:40:11,793 --> 00:40:14,295
You're not planning to leave, are you?

335
00:40:17,465 --> 00:40:19,342
No, I'm not.

336
00:40:29,394 --> 00:40:31,521
So now we've got it on tape?

337
00:40:34,148 --> 00:40:37,235
Yes.
It's already on the Internet.

338
00:40:54,503 --> 00:40:56,713
- What are you doing?
- Sorry?

339
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,675
- Go and sleep in your own bed.
- I want to be close to you.

340
00:41:03,887 --> 00:41:06,097
OK, but I want to sleep.

341
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:21,320
What has happened to you?
How did you turn out this way?

342
00:41:25,784 --> 00:41:30,581
You know everything about me.
I don't know shit about you.

343
00:41:32,623 --> 00:41:34,668
Not a damn thing.

344
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:38,505
That's the way it is.

345
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:18,711
- Who is it?
- Morell.

346
00:42:22,173 --> 00:42:24,717
I've found the last one.

347
00:42:24,885 --> 00:42:28,472
Rebecka Jacobsson, nickname Bea.

348
00:42:29,764 --> 00:42:31,016
BJ.

349
00:42:32,518 --> 00:42:35,436
That's why we didn't find her.

350
00:42:36,063 --> 00:42:40,608
"A man or a woman who is a medium
or a spiritist among you...

351
00:42:40,775 --> 00:42:44,070
must be put to death.
You are to stone them."

352
00:42:47,074 --> 00:42:49,117
It's her.

353
00:42:50,202 --> 00:42:52,954
- Where was she killed?
- In Karlstad.

354
00:42:53,121 --> 00:42:55,456
But that's not the interesting part.

355
00:42:55,623 --> 00:43:01,045
Rebecka worked for the Vanger Group
until her death in January 1965.

356
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:05,384
As a secretary for Gottfried Vanger.

357
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:08,887
Gottfried died before
Harriet disappeared. So it wasn't him.

358
00:43:09,054 --> 00:43:13,391
But we've got to check if she knew
other members of the Vanger family.

359
00:43:13,559 --> 00:43:17,980
- Do you have the reports?
- Karlstad is sending them.

360
00:43:34,788 --> 00:43:36,956
- Hold on.
- What?

361
00:43:37,123 --> 00:43:39,668
Rebecka and Sara are Jewish names.

362
00:43:39,835 --> 00:43:41,628
- Magda...
- Magdalena.

363
00:43:43,547 --> 00:43:46,257
Mari, Maria. But Liv?

364
00:43:50,429 --> 00:43:54,807
Liv means Eve. I bet
Liv Ingvartsson was Jewish as well.

365
00:43:54,974 --> 00:43:59,438
Racist murders.
It fits the pseudo religious rituals.

366
00:44:01,481 --> 00:44:03,858
But what about Harriet?

367
00:44:04,025 --> 00:44:07,612
Harriet died because she discovered a pattern.

368
00:44:07,778 --> 00:44:10,197
How the hell could we miss it?

369
00:44:10,364 --> 00:44:14,161
They're Jewish names. There were
three Nazis in the Vanger family.

370
00:44:14,327 --> 00:44:17,039
Only one was still alive when Harriet died.

371
00:44:17,831 --> 00:44:19,416
Harald.

372
00:44:21,083 --> 00:44:24,378
Who happened to be hunting
when you were running in the woods.

373
00:44:32,637 --> 00:44:35,389
The first murder took place there in 1949.

374
00:44:36,182 --> 00:44:39,978
Then Dalarna, Vilhelmina, Uppsala, Karlstad.

375
00:44:40,144 --> 00:44:43,690
If Harald has been there, he's left traces.

376
00:44:43,856 --> 00:44:48,027
- What do you mean?
- The accounts of the Vanger Group.

377
00:44:48,195 --> 00:44:52,907
Business travels. There must be
evidence. Restaurant and hotel bills.

378
00:44:53,074 --> 00:44:55,786
You think he got a tax deduction for murder?

379
00:44:55,952 --> 00:44:59,539
Well, I know about businessmen.

380
00:45:00,581 --> 00:45:04,293
Even if we can prove he's been
everywhere, it's not enough.

381
00:45:09,007 --> 00:45:13,302
- Maybe he's hunting now.
- You suggest we break in?

382
00:45:18,432 --> 00:45:21,936
We keep a staff of accountants in Hedestad.

383
00:45:22,103 --> 00:45:24,898
Do you think they keep records that far back?

384
00:45:25,065 --> 00:45:30,237
I think so.
May I ask what you're looking for?

385
00:45:30,403 --> 00:45:33,407
I'd rather you didn't,
but we'll get back to you.

386
00:45:33,572 --> 00:45:36,117
- I'll arrange it with Frode.
- Thanks.

387
00:45:36,284 --> 00:45:38,202
Mikael.

388
00:45:38,369 --> 00:45:43,250
I'm sorry about the meeting.
I didn't mean to be difficult.

389
00:45:43,416 --> 00:45:47,795
But protecting the family
is an ingrained response.

390
00:45:47,963 --> 00:45:49,422
No problem.

391
00:45:49,588 --> 00:45:52,217
- How's your head?
- Fine, thanks.

392
00:45:52,384 --> 00:45:54,344
Look after yourself.

393
00:45:56,596 --> 00:45:59,349
We need to go back quite a few years.

394
00:46:00,726 --> 00:46:04,021
89... 89...

395
00:46:05,813 --> 00:46:08,525
We need the accounts from 1949 until 1966.

396
00:46:08,692 --> 00:46:11,987
Thank Henrik for his old-fashioned
business practices.

397
00:46:12,153 --> 00:46:15,322
Otherwise, they would've
been shredded long ago.

398
00:46:15,574 --> 00:46:18,784
Well, it's all there.
Knock yourself out.

399
00:46:21,204 --> 00:46:25,833
Miss Salander, what exactly
have you found so far?

400
00:46:26,001 --> 00:46:28,461
Thank you, that was all.

401
00:48:13,608 --> 00:48:16,360
IN THE NAME OF THE FÜHRER
I BESTOW...

402
00:48:54,106 --> 00:48:57,818
What the hell are you doing here?
Answer me!

403
00:48:58,737 --> 00:49:00,487
- Huh?
- Take it easy.

404
00:49:00,655 --> 00:49:05,702
You're gonna write about me
in your damn communist magazine?

405
00:49:05,869 --> 00:49:07,913
I'm leaving now. Don't shoot.

406
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:12,416
You broke into my home,
so I'm free to kill you.

407
00:49:12,583 --> 00:49:15,211
What the hell is going on here?

408
00:49:16,253 --> 00:49:19,173
- Freeze!
- Drop the gun, Harald.

409
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:22,427
- Come on, drop it.
- Stay out of it!

410
00:49:24,637 --> 00:49:26,847
Drop the gun. Drop it.

411
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:41,570
Are you OK?

412
00:49:42,489 --> 00:49:46,659
How the hell could Gottfried
have such a wuss of a son?

413
00:49:50,579 --> 00:49:52,581
HARALD NO
MALMÖ

414
00:49:54,918 --> 00:49:57,253
HARALD IMPOSSIBLE
HOTEL IN STOCKHOLM

415
00:49:57,420 --> 00:49:59,547
HARALD NO
HAMBURG

416
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:02,300
Harald...

417
00:50:07,264 --> 00:50:08,597
No.

418
00:50:17,690 --> 00:50:19,150
No.

419
00:50:25,447 --> 00:50:29,619
- We've got to call Morell.
- We can call him from my place.

420
00:50:31,621 --> 00:50:35,666
Harald's not going anywhere.
Come on.

421
00:50:59,273 --> 00:51:01,318
Gottfried?

422
00:51:12,244 --> 00:51:13,788
Gottfried.

423
00:51:28,427 --> 00:51:30,554
Uppsala 1964!

424
00:51:47,697 --> 00:51:49,657
January, February...

425
00:51:50,532 --> 00:51:52,284
April...

426
00:51:57,664 --> 00:51:58,791
VANGER OFFICES IN SWEDEN

427
00:51:58,958 --> 00:52:01,001
Wasn't there a group photo?

428
00:52:05,507 --> 00:52:07,967
What the hell?

429
00:52:09,594 --> 00:52:11,721
Can that be right?

430
00:52:18,853 --> 00:52:20,688
Blue sweater.

431
00:52:31,699 --> 00:52:33,492
What the fuck?

432
00:52:34,994 --> 00:52:36,663
Shit.

433
00:52:54,639 --> 00:52:56,641
Is it helping?

434
00:52:56,807 --> 00:53:00,728
- He gave me a hell of a scare.
- You don't mess with Harald.

435
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:04,606
What were you doing in his house?

436
00:53:06,192 --> 00:53:11,739
Harriet discovered a handful
of murders from the '40s to the '60s.

437
00:53:11,905 --> 00:53:16,034
We know she found a pattern
the police didn't know about.

438
00:53:16,202 --> 00:53:19,164
We believe that's why she was killed.

439
00:53:20,581 --> 00:53:24,918
But that...
It sounds totally insane.

440
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:29,007
We've found a pattern regarding the victims.

441
00:53:29,548 --> 00:53:32,135
They all had Jewish names.

442
00:53:32,302 --> 00:53:37,724
Well, Harald isn't exactly
crazy about Abraham's kin.

443
00:53:37,891 --> 00:53:41,478
No. So I went to his house
to see if I could find anything.

444
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:46,106
- And?
- What do I know?

445
00:53:47,983 --> 00:53:50,110
He turned up so soon.

446
00:53:51,195 --> 00:53:55,365
But he didn't exactly act all innocent.

447
00:53:55,532 --> 00:53:57,242
No.

448
00:53:57,409 --> 00:54:00,954
If Lisbeth can track down
his travel activities from the accounts,

449
00:54:01,121 --> 00:54:04,958
we've got evidence against him.
Bills, invoices.

450
00:54:05,126 --> 00:54:07,003
She's going through everything.

451
00:54:20,349 --> 00:54:23,018
Very well. I'll call the police.

452
00:54:24,103 --> 00:54:25,938
Try Morell.

453
00:54:52,382 --> 00:54:54,634
What were you doing at Harald's?

454
00:54:57,344 --> 00:54:59,264
There, there.

455
00:55:37,302 --> 00:55:41,389
Scream as much as you want to, Mikael.
Scream as much as you can.

456
00:55:41,556 --> 00:55:43,682
You think anyone'll hear you?

457
00:56:11,543 --> 00:56:14,838
We both know how it's going to end for you.

458
00:56:25,016 --> 00:56:26,851
Why?

459
00:56:27,893 --> 00:56:29,728
Why what?

460
00:56:30,605 --> 00:56:33,023
- All of this.
- Why not?

461
00:56:34,442 --> 00:56:38,278
I'm doing what every man dreams of.
I take what I want.

462
00:56:40,947 --> 00:56:43,701
How many women after the first?

463
00:56:45,161 --> 00:56:48,498
I don't know.
I've lost count.

464
00:56:48,664 --> 00:56:52,960
I had a girl in that cage
when we were dining upstairs.

465
00:56:54,628 --> 00:56:58,965
Those kinds of women disappear
all the time. Nobody misses them.

466
00:57:00,134 --> 00:57:02,679
Whores, immigrants.

467
00:57:04,514 --> 00:57:06,932
Fucking hell.

468
00:57:14,398 --> 00:57:17,443
What do you do with them?

469
00:57:17,610 --> 00:57:19,987
What about the references, the mutilations...

470
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:28,454
That was my father's project. He mixed
his hobby with race and religion.

471
00:57:28,621 --> 00:57:33,668
But it was a mistake.
You shouldn't leave the bodies behind.

472
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:42,844
I take them for a trip in my boat
and then I drop them in the sea.

473
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,442
Mikael?

474
00:58:31,099 --> 00:58:33,186
Mari was my first.

475
00:58:36,563 --> 00:58:38,023
'64.

476
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:41,110
You were 16 years old.

477
00:58:41,277 --> 00:58:46,907
It was Dad, Gottfried, who taught me
how I should strangle her.

478
00:58:56,166 --> 00:58:58,085
It's sick.

479
00:58:58,753 --> 00:59:00,963
It's mainly for the sex.

480
00:59:02,422 --> 00:59:07,512
When I put them down, it's only
a logical consequence of the rape.

481
00:59:07,677 --> 00:59:10,097
You can't leave any witnesses.

482
00:59:10,264 --> 00:59:15,186
Even though I have to admit
I love seeing their disappointment.

483
00:59:18,021 --> 00:59:22,235
- Disappointment?
- They don't realise that they'll die.

484
00:59:23,277 --> 00:59:28,282
It doesn't really fit into
their scheme of things.

485
00:59:28,449 --> 00:59:31,827
They always think I'll show them mercy.

486
00:59:34,329 --> 00:59:36,833
It's a fantastic moment...

487
00:59:38,918 --> 00:59:42,170
when they realise
they're not getting away.

488
00:59:44,215 --> 00:59:46,217
When the eyes...

489
00:59:47,217 --> 00:59:49,679
switch off and die.

490
00:59:51,681 --> 00:59:54,141
You'll experience that yourself.

491
00:59:57,644 --> 01:00:01,731
And your sister? What did it feel like
when your sister's eyes died?

492
01:00:01,898 --> 01:00:04,985
- Harriet disappeared.
- You want me to believe that?

493
01:00:05,152 --> 01:00:07,362
Believe what the hell you want to.

494
01:00:10,574 --> 01:00:14,244
I would have enjoyed killing her.
But she disappeared.

495
01:00:15,036 --> 01:00:17,123
Just like you'll disappear.

496
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:26,090
Do you want some water?

497
01:00:29,719 --> 01:00:31,094
Sure.

498
01:00:46,027 --> 01:00:47,402
Thanks.

499
01:00:48,905 --> 01:00:52,657
You see...
you're just like everybody else.

500
01:00:54,159 --> 01:00:59,789
It only takes a simple human gesture
to ignite a small hope

501
01:00:59,956 --> 01:01:03,543
that I might let you go after all.

502
01:01:07,005 --> 01:01:08,507
Right?

503
01:01:41,248 --> 01:01:44,543
Take it easy.
It'll be quick.

504
01:01:47,128 --> 01:01:50,800
I'm mostly looking forward
to your little girlfriend.

505
01:02:06,023 --> 01:02:08,025
Come on, you little cunt.

506
01:02:24,916 --> 01:02:26,876
Are you OK?

507
01:03:09,586 --> 01:03:11,422
Fuck!

508
01:04:31,168 --> 01:04:33,628
I can't...

509
01:04:34,797 --> 01:04:36,632
I can't...

510
01:04:38,759 --> 01:04:40,969
I can't move.

511
01:04:43,472 --> 01:04:46,099
I can't move.

512
01:04:49,311 --> 01:04:51,146
Help me.

513
01:04:53,731 --> 01:04:56,235
Please help me.

514
01:06:54,603 --> 01:06:59,525
- Where's Martin?
- He's not coming back.

515
01:07:03,070 --> 01:07:04,989
What do you mean?

516
01:07:06,907 --> 01:07:09,076
He drove to his death.

517
01:07:14,164 --> 01:07:17,041
- He's finished.
- Are you positive?

518
01:07:20,670 --> 01:07:22,922
What the hell did you do?

519
01:07:24,842 --> 01:07:28,469
He died in a car accident.
We don't know anything. OK?

520
01:07:38,856 --> 01:07:40,231
Blomkvist!

521
01:07:42,818 --> 01:07:45,945
- What the hell happened here?
- The cellar.

522
01:08:10,262 --> 01:08:12,347
What happened out there?

523
01:08:17,644 --> 01:08:20,021
He didn't die in an accident, did he?

524
01:08:24,693 --> 01:08:26,694
Damn it, Lisbeth.

525
01:08:26,862 --> 01:08:31,408
His father taught him to kill
when he was 16 years old.

526
01:08:32,493 --> 01:08:35,578
That would make anybody sick in the brain.

527
01:08:35,746 --> 01:08:39,750
Don't make him into a fucking victim.
He nearly killed you.

528
01:08:39,917 --> 01:08:42,668
He was a killer and a rapist,
and he enjoyed it.

529
01:08:42,836 --> 01:08:47,091
He had the same chances as everyone
else. You choose who you want to be.

530
01:08:47,256 --> 01:08:51,677
He wasn't a victim. He was
an evil motherfucker who hated women.

531
01:08:56,850 --> 01:08:58,851
How did he die?

532
01:09:04,233 --> 01:09:05,984
He burned to death.

533
01:09:11,198 --> 01:09:14,784
- Could you have saved him?
- Yes.

534
01:09:14,952 --> 01:09:17,996
- But you let him burn.
- Yes.

535
01:10:03,667 --> 01:10:06,502
I would never have done that, Lisbeth.

536
01:10:08,296 --> 01:10:11,425
But I understand why you did it.

537
01:10:14,761 --> 01:10:17,389
I don't know what you've been through.

538
01:10:20,766 --> 01:10:23,854
But I almost died in that cellar...

539
01:10:25,189 --> 01:10:27,440
and you saved my life.

540
01:10:33,613 --> 01:10:35,948
Whatever it is you've been through,

541
01:10:38,493 --> 01:10:41,121
you don't have to tell me.

542
01:10:44,582 --> 01:10:47,043
I'm just glad you're here.

543
01:10:58,430 --> 01:10:59,931
Thanks.

544
01:11:17,157 --> 01:11:20,493
For the first time in my life I feel old.

545
01:11:30,503 --> 01:11:34,216
Well... What do we do now?

546
01:11:37,176 --> 01:11:40,180
We'll have to identify all the victims.

547
01:11:43,350 --> 01:11:45,269
Notify their next of kin.

548
01:11:47,854 --> 01:11:52,024
Get in touch with the ones we can find
and tell them what happened.

549
01:11:54,235 --> 01:11:56,363
How can one ever make it up to them?

550
01:11:59,198 --> 01:12:03,787
By providing some kind
of financial compensation? No.

551
01:12:04,662 --> 01:12:09,876
Well, Mikael, it's the story of the decade.

552
01:12:12,212 --> 01:12:15,881
You've got your work cut out for you
while you're in prison.

553
01:12:18,885 --> 01:12:21,430
It's a good story.

554
01:12:22,221 --> 01:12:24,265
But I'm not going to write about it.

555
01:12:28,311 --> 01:12:30,439
I don't know how to thank you.

556
01:12:30,605 --> 01:12:33,734
You solved a mystery that occupied
far too many years of my life.

557
01:12:36,778 --> 01:12:41,115
Well, it was my very first case.

558
01:12:42,408 --> 01:12:44,661
How fitting that it would be my last.

559
01:12:50,958 --> 01:12:53,295
We're not finished yet.

560
01:12:54,546 --> 01:12:56,131
What do you mean?

561
01:12:56,297 --> 01:12:58,966
Harriet wasn't one of Martin's victims.

562
01:12:59,134 --> 01:13:00,469
What are you saying?

563
01:13:00,636 --> 01:13:03,387
Martin didn't kill Harriet.

564
01:13:11,771 --> 01:13:13,939
Lisbeth?

565
01:13:16,777 --> 01:13:18,487
Lisbeth?

566
01:13:42,677 --> 01:13:46,972
THERE ARE TWO ANITA VANGERS.
ONE OF THEM DIED IN LONDON.

567
01:13:47,140 --> 01:13:52,813
THE OTHER ONE LIVES IN AUSTRALIA.
FIRST ENTRY INTO THE COUNTRY IN 1966.

568
01:15:02,423 --> 01:15:04,301
Harriet?

569
01:15:07,679 --> 01:15:09,597
Harriet Vanger?

570
01:15:20,358 --> 01:15:22,234
Harriet Vanger?

571
01:15:35,539 --> 01:15:40,503
Yes. You and your cousin babysat me
when I was a small boy.

572
01:15:43,297 --> 01:15:46,426
But I'm here on behalf of Henrik Vanger.

573
01:15:59,523 --> 01:16:01,608
Does he know I'm alive?

574
01:16:06,488 --> 01:16:08,198
Not yet.

575
01:16:11,076 --> 01:16:15,247
Is this to do with my brother's
death in a car accident?

576
01:16:15,412 --> 01:16:19,376
- How did you know that?
- We do have Internet access here.

577
01:16:25,881 --> 01:16:28,301
Your brother did this.

578
01:16:30,554 --> 01:16:32,555
He nearly killed me.

579
01:16:41,146 --> 01:16:43,274
It doesn't surprise me.

580
01:16:49,363 --> 01:16:51,908
I'm here to visit Agneta Salander.

581
01:16:52,074 --> 01:16:55,453
- Who can I say it is?
- Her daughter.

582
01:16:55,619 --> 01:16:59,123
Her daughter?
Are you Agneta's daughter?

583
01:17:01,292 --> 01:17:04,796
I'm sorry, it's just...
I've never seen you before.

584
01:17:06,131 --> 01:17:08,675
A visitor for Agneta Salander.

585
01:17:10,092 --> 01:17:11,886
OK.

586
01:17:12,052 --> 01:17:13,721
Room 314.

587
01:17:51,342 --> 01:17:53,011
Hi, Mum.

588
01:17:56,514 --> 01:17:57,974
Mum?

589
01:18:00,518 --> 01:18:02,811
It's me. Lisbeth.

590
01:18:11,738 --> 01:18:13,530
Lisbeth...

591
01:18:22,039 --> 01:18:24,083
Are you Lisbeth?

592
01:18:26,002 --> 01:18:28,921
I wanted to come a long time ago.

593
01:18:37,430 --> 01:18:39,724
You look so different now.

594
01:18:46,523 --> 01:18:49,943
- Do you have kids?
- No.

595
01:18:53,779 --> 01:18:55,698
A boyfriend?

596
01:19:00,619 --> 01:19:02,579
There is someone...

597
01:19:08,502 --> 01:19:11,088
but you should never fall in love.

598
01:19:11,922 --> 01:19:14,634
You know that better than anyone.

599
01:19:19,805 --> 01:19:21,725
Right, Mum?

600
01:19:29,899 --> 01:19:33,069
I should have picked a better father for you.

601
01:19:34,570 --> 01:19:38,742
Mum...
It was you he harmed.

602
01:19:46,750 --> 01:19:48,460
Mum...

603
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:01,555
Come in.

604
01:20:07,186 --> 01:20:10,064
Mikael. Welcome back.

605
01:20:12,649 --> 01:20:17,113
I've got a nice surprise. Promise me
you won't have a heart attack.

606
01:20:17,279 --> 01:20:21,367
With all the pills I'm popping at the moment,

607
01:20:21,533 --> 01:20:25,121
I think it's physically impossible
to have a heart attack.

608
01:20:52,899 --> 01:20:54,734
Harriet?

609
01:21:16,588 --> 01:21:18,423
Forgive me.

610
01:21:29,101 --> 01:21:31,020
I'm sorry.

611
01:21:34,106 --> 01:21:35,984
I'm sorry.

612
01:21:46,411 --> 01:21:50,081
I was 14 when Dad raped me for the first time.

613
01:21:51,541 --> 01:21:54,586
A year later he took me to his cottage.

614
01:21:56,837 --> 01:21:58,715
Then Martin joined in.

615
01:22:02,010 --> 01:22:07,140
They abused me again several times after that.

616
01:22:11,019 --> 01:22:13,145
One day I'd had enough.

617
01:22:17,567 --> 01:22:20,153
<i>Dad was drunk as usual.</i>

618
01:22:28,368 --> 01:22:33,416
<i>He reeled off Bible verses and boasted
about all the women he'd killed.</i>

619
01:22:41,216 --> 01:22:43,885
I took the oar and hit him hard.

620
01:22:53,185 --> 01:22:56,730
<i>I forced him underwater until
the surface became still.</i>

621
01:23:14,832 --> 01:23:18,418
Then I pushed the boat out
to make it look like an accident.

622
01:23:20,712 --> 01:23:23,091
<i>But when I turned around...</i>

623
01:23:25,969 --> 01:23:28,345
<i>Martin was there.</i>

624
01:23:31,056 --> 01:23:34,351
<i>Martin treated me even worse than Gottfried.</i>

625
01:23:35,603 --> 01:23:38,939
<i>You sent him to a boarding school in Uppsala,</i>

626
01:23:39,106 --> 01:23:42,443
<i>but on Children's Day he came back.</i>

627
01:23:44,569 --> 01:23:48,115
<i>I was terrified it would start all over again.</i>

628
01:23:56,623 --> 01:23:58,917
And then you went to Anita?

629
01:23:59,752 --> 01:24:03,881
Anita helped me out of here.

630
01:24:04,047 --> 01:24:08,511
When the bridge was opened, she drove the car.

631
01:24:08,677 --> 01:24:13,099
I was in the back seat under a blanket.

632
01:24:17,478 --> 01:24:20,314
I've been thinking of you all these years.

633
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:25,653
I sent you the framed flowers...

634
01:24:25,819 --> 01:24:29,990
because I wanted to tell you
that I was out there somewhere.

635
01:24:32,909 --> 01:24:38,373
So I was sad to hear Mikael tell me
what you'd read into them.

636
01:24:39,207 --> 01:24:44,505
If you hadn't sent them,
you wouldn't be sitting here now.

637
01:24:54,474 --> 01:24:55,932
No.

638
01:25:12,449 --> 01:25:14,743
Lisbeth, it's me again.

639
01:25:16,371 --> 01:25:18,706
Call me if you get this.

640
01:25:21,501 --> 01:25:25,380
I hope you're all right.
Call me.

641
01:25:38,475 --> 01:25:40,228
You've got a visitor.

642
01:25:40,811 --> 01:25:42,563
Thirty minutes.

643
01:25:50,529 --> 01:25:53,073
I'm so happy to see you.

644
01:26:00,163 --> 01:26:01,498
Here.

645
01:26:02,332 --> 01:26:05,002
- What's this?
- A bit of reading.

646
01:26:12,176 --> 01:26:16,430
- Don't you want to sit down?
- I just wanted to give you that.

647
01:26:35,449 --> 01:26:38,286
I've only got one and a half months left.

648
01:27:09,108 --> 01:27:11,569
EVERYBODY'S GOT SECRETS

649
01:27:54,487 --> 01:28:00,408
WENNERSTRÖM'S EMPIRE RESEMBLES
A LIVING, BREATHING ORGANISM...

650
01:28:02,787 --> 01:28:06,791
<i>Reporter Mikael Blomkvist,
who's served a sentence</i>

651
01:28:06,957 --> 01:28:10,127
<i>for libelling
the tycoon Hans-Erik Wennerström,</i>

652
01:28:10,293 --> 01:28:12,712
<i>now accuses Wennerström again.</i>

653
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:15,507
<i>In the magazine</i> Millennium,

654
01:28:15,675 --> 01:28:19,554
<i>Blomkvist accuses Wennerström
of using his companies</i>

655
01:28:19,720 --> 01:28:22,556
<i>to commit serious financial crimes.</i>

656
01:28:22,722 --> 01:28:26,351
- Why are you going after him again?
- It makes you wonder.

657
01:28:26,519 --> 01:28:29,896
- What will happen to Wennerström?
- There's an empty cell now.

658
01:28:30,064 --> 01:28:35,903
<i>It's a tangled web, where the value
of Wennerström Group holdings</i>

659
01:28:36,069 --> 01:28:40,658
<i>has been inflated by investments
in fictitious "mailbox firms".</i>

660
01:28:40,824 --> 01:28:46,663
<i>Blomkvist describes an empire
founded on phoney options, accounts,</i>

661
01:28:46,831 --> 01:28:50,792
<i>loan guarantees and foreign

662
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:56,090

<i>the group supports Third World cartels,</i>

663

<i>cartels that are involved

Janne.

665
01:29:05,975 --> 01:29:12,480
<i>And a member of the</i> Millennium <i>staff</i>
<i>has been on the group's payroll,</i>

666
01:29:12,648 --> 01:29:19,697

undermining the publication's efforts.</i>

667
01:29:19,863 --> 01:29:23,576
<i>This is the latest of many
shocking developments...</i>

668
01:29:35,296 --> 01:29:37,256
Really special.

669
01:29:37,422 --> 01:29:39,091
There he is!

670
01:29:42,094 --> 01:29:44,180
Micke! Micke! Micke!

671
01:29:50,226 --> 01:29:52,520
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

672
01:30:00,112 --> 01:30:03,740
<i>The wanted tycoon Wennerström</i>

673
01:30:03,908 --> 01:30:08,078
<i>was found dead this morning
in an apartment in Marbella, Spain.</i>

674
01:30:08,244 --> 01:30:12,707
<i>A cleaning lady found
the 44-year-old tycoon.</i>

675
01:30:12,875 --> 01:30:16,045
<i>According to the police, it was suicide.</i>

676
01:30:16,212 --> 01:30:18,546
<i>There's no suspicion of a crime.</i>

677
01:31:04,176 --> 01:31:08,264
<i>Yet another interesting turn of events
in the Wennerström case.</i>

678
01:31:08,430 --> 01:31:13,644
<i>When the police examined
all of Wennerström's bank accounts,</i>

679
01:31:13,810 --> 01:31:17,648
<i>it appeared that a large sum has been withdrawn</i>

01:31:20,609 --> 01:31:24,779
