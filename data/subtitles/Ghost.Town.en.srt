1
00:00:58,872 --> 00:01:01,705
Hello? Is anybody there?

2
00:01:03,444 --> 00:01:05,742
Hey, honey, what's up?

3
00:01:05,813 --> 00:01:08,941
Slow down. Who are you talking about?

4
00:01:09,016 --> 00:01:12,452
No, I don't know! Sweetheart,
I don't have a clue what you're...

5
00:01:12,753 --> 00:01:14,243
An apartment?

6
00:01:16,824 --> 00:01:19,122
No, no! Of course I'm not
looking at an apartment!

7
00:01:19,193 --> 00:01:21,821
Why would I be
looking at an apartment?

8
00:01:23,464 --> 00:01:25,227
Wait a sec, wait. I know what this is.

9
00:01:25,299 --> 00:01:30,032
Oldest trick in the book. Yeah.
Did a realtor call you? Yeah.

10
00:01:30,104 --> 00:01:33,540
Yeah, realtor calls the wife, says,
"Oh, yeah, I spoke to the husband.

11
00:01:33,607 --> 00:01:35,734
"I'm looking at a... "

12
00:01:35,809 --> 00:01:38,937
My card? My business card?
I don't know.

13
00:01:41,348 --> 00:01:43,646
That I don't know. I don't know
why he has my business card.

14
00:01:43,717 --> 00:01:45,082
Maybe he...

15
00:01:46,386 --> 00:01:48,445
Maybe he or she, then.

16
00:01:50,591 --> 00:01:51,888
Yeah.

17
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:54,257
Okay, surprise ruined.

18
00:01:54,328 --> 00:01:55,727
No, no, it's all right.

19
00:01:55,796 --> 00:01:57,787
It was gonna be for our anniversary,
but I...

20
00:01:57,865 --> 00:01:59,958
Yeah, it's just a little one-bedroom
in the West Village,

21
00:02:00,033 --> 00:02:01,295
but you're gonna love it.

22
00:02:01,368 --> 00:02:03,859
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

23
00:02:03,971 --> 00:02:06,303
Hey, listen, the car never picked me up
for this thing at the Waldorf.

24
00:02:06,373 --> 00:02:09,501
I got to go. I'll see you at home tonight,
okay, honey?

25
00:02:09,576 --> 00:02:12,044
I love you, too.

26
00:02:12,112 --> 00:02:14,512
It's okay. Big kiss.

27
00:02:14,581 --> 00:02:16,606
All right, then. Bye-bye.

28
00:02:24,992 --> 00:02:26,550
Hey, let me ask you a question.

29
00:02:26,627 --> 00:02:28,754
You a real estate broker
or a professional fucking idiot?

30
00:02:31,498 --> 00:02:33,932
Babe, I really think
we ought to let the super do that.

31
00:02:34,001 --> 00:02:35,764
No, I got it, I got it.
Just move that stuff.

32
00:02:35,836 --> 00:02:38,304
No, I did not say
my wife needs to see the apartment.

33
00:02:38,372 --> 00:02:41,808
I said Amber needs
to see the apartment. Amber.

34
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:44,969
Amber sound like the wife
of a man my age to you?

35
00:02:45,746 --> 00:02:47,577
- Careful with my table!
- Yeah, picked it up right now.

36
00:02:47,648 --> 00:02:48,706
Okay, just get the cord for me, will you?

37
00:02:48,782 --> 00:02:50,943
Okay, all right. I got it, baby.
What do you want me to do with it?

38
00:02:51,018 --> 00:02:53,043
Just keep it out of my way.

39
00:02:53,687 --> 00:02:55,382
Well, it's not exactly a love nest

40
00:02:55,455 --> 00:02:58,015
if my wife's there picking out
the goddamned curtains, is it?

41
00:02:58,091 --> 00:03:00,059
Careful, just get the window,
get the window.

42
00:03:00,127 --> 00:03:01,526
- Okay?
- Ready?

43
00:03:01,595 --> 00:03:03,119
Yeah, just pull it down, and inside.

44
00:03:03,197 --> 00:03:06,291
No, I'm telling you right now,
stop talking.

45
00:03:06,366 --> 00:03:07,890
Because I'm thinking.

46
00:03:07,968 --> 00:03:11,995
No, I'm thinking! I don't...
You know what? Just kill it.

47
00:03:12,072 --> 00:03:14,336
No, kill it. Kill the whole thing.

48
00:03:14,408 --> 00:03:17,707
- There, good.
- See? DIY. "Do It Yourself. "

49
00:03:17,778 --> 00:03:19,006
Oh, no!

50
00:03:22,983 --> 00:03:24,917
Call me over the weekend.
Leave a message on the home machine

51
00:03:24,985 --> 00:03:26,748
saying the seller's
had a change of heart,

52
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,220
and that the whole thing's...

53
00:03:29,289 --> 00:03:31,348
- Oh, my God!
... dead.

54
00:03:37,264 --> 00:03:39,129
You are not gonna believe
what almost just happened!

55
00:03:42,703 --> 00:03:45,194
- Did you see that?
- Someone call 911!

56
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:48,837
- Oh, my God, is he dead?
- He ain't happy.

57
00:04:02,122 --> 00:04:03,487
What?

58
00:04:08,295 --> 00:04:10,627
You cannot be serious!

59
00:04:14,968 --> 00:04:16,367
Not now.

60
00:05:32,646 --> 00:05:34,637
Okay, go ahead and spit.

61
00:05:37,884 --> 00:05:41,285
So, anyway, the very first scene
just takes your breath away.

62
00:05:41,355 --> 00:05:43,949
You have to remind yourself that
you're in the theater watching a play.

63
00:05:44,024 --> 00:05:47,357
My five-year-old, Alex, just adored it.

64
00:05:47,427 --> 00:05:50,123
He wanted his father to see it with us.

65
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:54,026
That's better.

66
00:05:54,101 --> 00:05:57,696
Anyway, I think he really,
really enjoyed the costumes...

67
00:05:59,306 --> 00:06:01,570
Dr. Pincus? Hi.

68
00:06:01,641 --> 00:06:03,939
I'm gonna need
the panoramic X-ray machine

69
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:05,204
for most of the morning tomorrow,

70
00:06:05,278 --> 00:06:07,644
so if that fits in
with your appointments...

71
00:06:07,714 --> 00:06:09,682
Fine.
I've cleared my schedule for tomorrow.

72
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,944
Really?

73
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:16,646
I hear it's supposed to be a lovely day.

74
00:06:19,493 --> 00:06:20,551
And?

75
00:06:21,461 --> 00:06:25,864
No, I just thought that maybe
you were taking the day off to go and...

76
00:06:29,069 --> 00:06:31,799
Right. Sorry to bother you.

77
00:06:34,074 --> 00:06:36,975
You know, we brought some cake.

78
00:06:37,377 --> 00:06:40,778
Mrs. Prashar and I
just had our baby, so...

79
00:06:43,717 --> 00:06:45,378
Yeah, it's a girl,

80
00:06:45,452 --> 00:06:52,153
and we're having a little cake
and I brought some pictures, so, if you...

81
00:06:52,225 --> 00:06:54,056
That'd be delightful.

82
00:06:56,096 --> 00:06:57,757
Start without me.

83
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:02,897
Great, great. Okay, so...

84
00:07:08,575 --> 00:07:10,805
What a cute baby. She is so cute.

85
00:07:10,877 --> 00:07:13,038
- Yeah, she really is.
- How long was the labor?

86
00:07:13,113 --> 00:07:14,876
- Ten hours.
- Ten hours?

87
00:07:14,948 --> 00:07:16,176
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

88
00:07:16,249 --> 00:07:20,015
- That seems like a really long time.
- No, not really.

89
00:07:20,086 --> 00:07:21,815
- It's not?
- Not really.

90
00:07:21,888 --> 00:07:23,947
- See, that's, like, too long.
- It's so worth it.

91
00:07:24,024 --> 00:07:26,515
I'll just get a cat, you know?

92
00:07:26,593 --> 00:07:30,689
Like, 10 hours is a long time
to get something, you know?

93
00:07:30,764 --> 00:07:32,163
- Look at that.
- So cute.

94
00:07:42,542 --> 00:07:44,305
Stop global warming?

95
00:07:54,588 --> 00:07:57,580
Yeah, just a tiny...
It might take a little jiggle.

96
00:07:57,657 --> 00:07:59,454
Good evening, Doctor.

97
00:08:00,193 --> 00:08:02,718
You know what? Let me just open it.

98
00:08:04,598 --> 00:08:08,159
Hey! Can you hold the elevator?
Please?

99
00:08:08,235 --> 00:08:11,033
- Yeah. Holding.
- Thank you.

100
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:17,403
- Sorry!
- Wait, hold. Hey! Hey!

101
00:09:29,482 --> 00:09:31,382
Good. Still some more.

102
00:09:44,631 --> 00:09:46,223
Come on, come on, come on,

103
00:09:46,299 --> 00:09:48,392
make it, make it, make it,
make it, make it, make it.

104
00:09:48,468 --> 00:09:51,835
<i>Paging Dr. Michael,
Dr. Michael to Pediatrics, please.</i>

105
00:09:51,905 --> 00:09:53,600
- Charts come back up, yet?
- They're there.

106
00:09:53,673 --> 00:09:54,731
I appreciate it.

107
00:09:54,808 --> 00:09:57,868
<b>- Spell it.
- P-I-N-C-U-S.</b>

108
00:09:57,944 --> 00:10:00,538
- Date of birth?
- Why?

109
00:10:00,614 --> 00:10:02,013
What day were you born?

110
00:10:02,082 --> 00:10:04,880
No, I understood the question.
Why do you need to know that?

111
00:10:04,951 --> 00:10:07,476
Let's leave it blank. Weight?

112
00:10:07,554 --> 00:10:09,454
- Last night or this morning?
- You pick.

113
00:10:09,522 --> 00:10:11,183
Hundred and eighty-two pounds.

114
00:10:11,257 --> 00:10:13,623
Number of alcoholic beverages
consumed per week?

115
00:10:13,693 --> 00:10:16,059
- Why do you need to know that?
- Well, they want to know.

116
00:10:16,129 --> 00:10:17,596
Well, I'm sure
"they" want to know a lot of things,

117
00:10:17,664 --> 00:10:19,359
but I don't want my intimate details

118
00:10:19,432 --> 00:10:21,627
auctioned off to the highest bidder,
willy-nilly.

119
00:10:21,701 --> 00:10:22,895
I'll put zero.

120
00:10:22,969 --> 00:10:24,960
- Marital status?
- Pass.

121
00:10:25,038 --> 00:10:26,972
- Profession?
- Irrelevant.

122
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,305
- Food allergies?
- I'm not gonna be eating here.

123
00:10:30,377 --> 00:10:33,346
- Are you allergic to sticking plaster?
- What a ludicrous question.

124
00:10:33,413 --> 00:10:34,710
I'm not answering
any more of these, really.

125
00:10:34,781 --> 00:10:36,408
- Do you smoke?
- Stop it.

126
00:10:36,483 --> 00:10:38,508
- Do you wear dentures?
- Madame, listen.

127
00:10:38,585 --> 00:10:43,352
- When was the last time you ate?
- A pertinent question at last.

128
00:10:43,423 --> 00:10:45,323
Yesterday, lunchtime.
Thanks for asking.

129
00:10:45,392 --> 00:10:47,519
I had a tuna sandwich.
Toast was soggy, but...

130
00:10:47,594 --> 00:10:50,688
- Did you drink the laxative solution?
- Yes.

131
00:10:50,764 --> 00:10:52,163
Did it work?

132
00:10:53,099 --> 00:10:56,227
It was as advertised.

133
00:10:56,302 --> 00:10:58,463
Did you evacuate your bowels?

134
00:10:58,538 --> 00:11:01,564
I drank copious amounts
of drain-cleaning fluid.

135
00:11:01,641 --> 00:11:03,506
<i>What followed was fait accompli.</i>

136
00:11:03,576 --> 00:11:05,100
Sir, what I'm asking is if you were...

137
00:11:05,178 --> 00:11:10,343
I shat. Okay? Good. Again and again.

138
00:11:10,417 --> 00:11:13,944
It was like a terrorist attack down there
in the darkness and the chaos,

139
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,851
the running and the screaming, okay?

140
00:11:15,922 --> 00:11:18,413
- Fine with me.
- Good.

141
00:11:18,491 --> 00:11:20,584
Gross invasion of my privacy, this.

142
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:23,151
Wait till they get you in the back.

143
00:11:24,764 --> 00:11:26,857
- Good morning, Dr. Pincus.
- Hi.

144
00:11:26,933 --> 00:11:28,264
Don't anticipate any difficulties today.

145
00:11:28,334 --> 00:11:30,165
We'll have you up
and on your feet in no time.

146
00:11:30,236 --> 00:11:31,260
- Okay.
- Quick question.

147
00:11:31,337 --> 00:11:33,430
I notice you requested
a general anesthetic.

148
00:11:33,506 --> 00:11:35,997
It's not really typical
for this type of procedure.

149
00:11:36,076 --> 00:11:37,634
- It's not necessary and we normally...
- Sorry.

150
00:11:37,711 --> 00:11:40,509
I have no intention of being around
when they go where they're going.

151
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,775
When does the surgeon arrive?

152
00:11:42,849 --> 00:11:44,077
I'm the surgeon.

153
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:45,947
- Really?
- Yeah.

154
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:47,577
- Why do you look that tan?
- Thanks for noticing.

155
00:11:47,654 --> 00:11:50,122
I got a spray tan
on my way to work today.

156
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:53,023
- Looks natural.
- Yes. It's better for you.

157
00:11:53,093 --> 00:11:55,186
<b>It's moisturizing
and it doesn't cause UV damage, so...</b>

158
00:11:55,261 --> 00:11:56,353
Yeah.

159
00:11:56,463 --> 00:11:58,624
It has an odd smell.
I can't quite place it.

160
00:11:58,698 --> 00:12:01,531
- I don't know if...
- No, I don't want to smell your fake tan!

161
00:12:01,601 --> 00:12:03,262
- What are you...
- It's like dirt.

162
00:12:03,336 --> 00:12:06,669
But like a garden dirt, like a good dirt.
Not like a garbage dirt.

163
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:09,504
- You gonna go darker?
- I think I am. I think I'd like to go darker.

164
00:12:09,576 --> 00:12:11,203
It's really gonna make my eyes pop.

165
00:12:11,277 --> 00:12:13,768
You could get your teeth whitened
like I did.

166
00:12:13,847 --> 00:12:14,973
- Yeah, that makes a difference.
- Very nice.

167
00:12:15,048 --> 00:12:18,176
Yeah, I don't like having trays
in my mouth and my teeth are small.

168
00:12:18,251 --> 00:12:19,582
Sorry, you babbling idiots.

169
00:12:19,652 --> 00:12:22,951
Can we talk about my bowels?
Wouldn't that be a good idea?

170
00:12:23,022 --> 00:12:25,252
Looks like the sodium thiopental's
really kicking in, huh?

171
00:12:25,325 --> 00:12:28,294
- Makes people say crazy things.
- I haven't given it to him yet.

172
00:12:28,361 --> 00:12:30,454
- Going in now.
- How old are you?

173
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:33,260
So are you here on a school field trip?

174
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,959
Not a real people person are you,
Dr. Pincus?

175
00:12:36,035 --> 00:12:39,698
Not really. Given a choice between
a few people and loads of people,

176
00:12:39,773 --> 00:12:42,071
I choose my cat. She hunts dwarves.

177
00:12:42,142 --> 00:12:44,042
She takes them up the tree.
They're still alive.

178
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:45,577
You can see their little legs going.

179
00:12:45,645 --> 00:12:48,443
Sounds like Norah Jones
when she plays the piano.

180
00:12:56,156 --> 00:12:59,023
Wow, you must be excited
to get home and see your cat.

181
00:12:59,092 --> 00:13:00,150
What cat?

182
00:13:00,226 --> 00:13:02,091
I thought yesterday
you said you had a cat.

183
00:13:02,162 --> 00:13:06,758
I despise cats. What sort of men
waste their affection on a cat? Pathetic.

184
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:09,267
I had a cat once, when I was a little girl.

185
00:13:09,369 --> 00:13:12,099
My father, right before he died,
he took me to the shelter and he said,

186
00:13:12,172 --> 00:13:13,469
"Debra, take a look
at all these lonely cats... "

187
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:15,405
What a wonderful man
he must have been.

188
00:13:15,475 --> 00:13:16,567
Now, listen.

189
00:13:16,643 --> 00:13:18,133
All those people in my room last night,

190
00:13:18,211 --> 00:13:19,906
I thought I was dreaming at first,
but I wasn't.

191
00:13:19,979 --> 00:13:21,469
Who were they?

192
00:13:22,182 --> 00:13:24,446
- I don't know anything about that.
- Right.

193
00:13:24,517 --> 00:13:28,180
- Here you go. Clean bill of health.
- All right, thank you.

194
00:13:29,355 --> 00:13:31,380
Come back soon!

195
00:13:31,457 --> 00:13:34,358
What a terrible thing to say
in a hospital.

196
00:13:47,907 --> 00:13:49,067
Nice.

197
00:13:49,776 --> 00:13:52,745
Fine example for healthcare workers.

198
00:13:52,812 --> 00:13:56,009
Still, I suppose
smoking serves a purpose.

199
00:13:56,082 --> 00:13:59,574
- Thins the herd. Weeds out the stupid.
- Are you speaking to me?

200
00:13:59,652 --> 00:14:01,552
Yeah, but I was having a go at them,
not you.

201
00:14:01,621 --> 00:14:02,883
Oh, good.

202
00:14:02,956 --> 00:14:06,687
I picked one that should be
in a straightjacket. My mistake.

203
00:14:13,433 --> 00:14:17,062
Show it some attention,
it follows you home. Unbelievable.

204
00:14:19,172 --> 00:14:20,400
Sorry!

205
00:14:24,344 --> 00:14:26,107
Did he see you, too?

206
00:14:31,084 --> 00:14:32,415
- He can see us!
- Who?

207
00:14:32,485 --> 00:14:33,782
That guy?

208
00:14:40,026 --> 00:14:42,494
Hey, why don't you open your eyes?

209
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:52,198
Hey!

210
00:14:53,239 --> 00:14:54,706
Hey, mister!

211
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:57,372
Please, just hold up!

212
00:14:58,077 --> 00:15:00,068
- Idiot. Get out of the road.
- Wait! Hey!

213
00:15:00,146 --> 00:15:03,172
- Listen, I just need two minutes...
- Look out!

214
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,047
...of your time!

215
00:15:10,089 --> 00:15:11,886
You can see me, huh?

216
00:15:13,826 --> 00:15:15,623
And you're not like us.

217
00:15:15,695 --> 00:15:18,789
I know you're not, because back there,
that cab almost hit you!

218
00:15:18,865 --> 00:15:21,698
And he honked at you,
and he yelled at you!

219
00:15:22,235 --> 00:15:24,931
I don't feel well. Why on earth...

220
00:15:26,239 --> 00:15:27,331
Hey!

221
00:15:35,915 --> 00:15:37,678
Officer, there's loony weirdoes.

222
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,547
I don't know why they're here.
I'm a dentist.

223
00:15:39,619 --> 00:15:41,849
- Hey, man, you can see me.
- Oh, good.

224
00:15:41,921 --> 00:15:44,151
Hey, come back here!
I wanna talk to you!

225
00:15:44,223 --> 00:15:45,713
Hey, don't be scared! I'm a cop!

226
00:15:45,792 --> 00:15:47,953
- He can see us?
- Who? That guy?

227
00:16:19,692 --> 00:16:21,319
...from the moment I left the hospital.

228
00:16:21,394 --> 00:16:24,158
- What kind of side effects?
- Hallucinations.

229
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:25,959
- Okay, visual or aural?
- Both.

230
00:16:26,032 --> 00:16:31,436
And really vivid, really realistic, weird.
I mean, that's not normal.

231
00:16:31,504 --> 00:16:35,304
Well, you know.
What's normal, you know? Really.

232
00:16:37,176 --> 00:16:39,041
Not having hallucinations,
I'd have thought.

233
00:16:39,112 --> 00:16:42,411
Did anything unusual happen
during my procedure?

234
00:16:42,482 --> 00:16:44,109
- Did any...
- Did any what...

235
00:16:44,183 --> 00:16:46,845
- Sorry, but did anything...
- Where?

236
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:49,319
- Why do you just keep talking while...
- I didn't hear what...

237
00:16:49,389 --> 00:16:52,517
- Why do you keep interrupting me?
- No, well...

238
00:16:52,592 --> 00:16:55,755
- Did anything unusual happen...
- You kind of interrupted me a little bit.

239
00:16:55,828 --> 00:16:57,420
- Just answer the...
- Just.

240
00:16:57,497 --> 00:16:59,260
- Did anything unusual happen?
- Where?

241
00:16:59,332 --> 00:17:02,893
What do you mean, where?
That's not a proper... Yes or no?

242
00:17:02,969 --> 00:17:04,869
Did anything unusual happen
during my procedure?

243
00:17:04,937 --> 00:17:05,961
- Yeah.
- What?

244
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:08,064
- No.
- You said "yes" first.

245
00:17:08,141 --> 00:17:13,511
"No" is what I ended with.
"Yes, no" means no.

246
00:17:15,882 --> 00:17:18,282
Did anything unusual happen
during my procedure?

247
00:17:18,351 --> 00:17:21,218
- And if so...
- Can you hold on one...

248
00:17:21,287 --> 00:17:23,312
Can you hold on a second?

249
00:17:25,658 --> 00:17:27,148
Yeah, it's me.

250
00:17:27,794 --> 00:17:31,594
Can you stop what you're doing
and come down here right away?

251
00:17:33,366 --> 00:17:35,994
It's that thing that we talked about.

252
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:40,562
Yeah, well, you told me to call you
if it came back, and it came back, so...

253
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,005
Okay.

254
00:17:42,075 --> 00:17:44,703
What was that? What's the thing?
You told someone the thing came back.

255
00:17:44,777 --> 00:17:48,907
I have a rash on my back.
It came back, so I had to call my doctor.

256
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:51,781
You... Miss!

257
00:17:51,851 --> 00:17:52,875
- Yes?
- Me!

258
00:17:52,952 --> 00:17:55,580
- What the... What?
- Can you...

259
00:17:55,688 --> 00:17:57,280
- Can I... Yes.
- Follow you?

260
00:17:57,356 --> 00:17:59,119
- To the...
- To my office.

261
00:17:59,192 --> 00:18:01,524
- And then you'll tell me.
- Yeah.

262
00:18:04,764 --> 00:18:05,890
What?

263
00:18:09,469 --> 00:18:11,699
Did anything unusual... What?

264
00:18:13,072 --> 00:18:16,007
Jesus Christ! Sorry, I wasn't...

265
00:18:16,209 --> 00:18:20,373
We have a meeting in a couple minutes,
so we just have to be quick.

266
00:18:22,615 --> 00:18:26,984
Did anything unusual happen
during my procedure? What's he...

267
00:18:27,053 --> 00:18:29,385
Can you please define "unusual"?

268
00:18:31,224 --> 00:18:34,125
Out of the ordinary,
bizarre, unanticipated.

269
00:18:38,064 --> 00:18:39,554
No, this went well.

270
00:18:39,632 --> 00:18:42,328
- It was good. Okay, normal.
- Right.

271
00:18:42,401 --> 00:18:44,596
Yes, good. Well, the cessation maybe,

272
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:47,503
- but after that, you responded...
- The cessation of what?

273
00:18:47,573 --> 00:18:50,064
Dr. Pincus, I really...
I don't need to tell you that

274
00:18:50,143 --> 00:18:52,873
every medical procedure
doesn't follow the same path.

275
00:18:52,945 --> 00:18:53,969
- Everyone's different.
- Yeah.

276
00:18:54,046 --> 00:18:56,378
There are subtle variations
in even the simplest surgical...

277
00:18:56,449 --> 00:18:59,213
What would a subtle variation be
in my case, for example?

278
00:18:59,285 --> 00:19:02,277
- Well, one doesn't wish to use jargon.
- No.

279
00:19:02,355 --> 00:19:05,518
- But, you know, technically...
- Yep.

280
00:19:05,591 --> 00:19:07,889
...medically, it's beginning...

281
00:19:11,397 --> 00:19:13,160
Okay. Yeah.

282
00:19:13,232 --> 00:19:15,223
- You died.
- I died?

283
00:19:15,301 --> 00:19:17,462
- Little bit.
- For how long?

284
00:19:17,537 --> 00:19:19,437
- Seven minutes.
- A bit less.

285
00:19:19,505 --> 00:19:20,767
I died for seven minutes.

286
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,864
- A bit less.
- Approximately seven...

287
00:19:21,941 --> 00:19:24,034
That's really the only thing
that I can think of...

288
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:26,340
How did I die?

289
00:19:26,412 --> 00:19:30,075
For the record, we did not recommend
that you use the general anesthesia.

290
00:19:30,149 --> 00:19:33,983
When you use anesthesia,
there is a chance, although it is small,

291
00:19:34,053 --> 00:19:37,022
of a biochemical anomaly.

292
00:19:37,089 --> 00:19:39,887
Where's the anesthesiologist?
I want to see him now.

293
00:19:39,959 --> 00:19:41,392
He does not work here anymore.

294
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,451
You'll be happy to know
that at Saint Victor's,

295
00:19:43,529 --> 00:19:46,396
we have a very strict
three-strikes policy.

296
00:19:48,034 --> 00:19:50,400
My anesthesiologist had two strikes?

297
00:19:50,469 --> 00:19:53,336
Okay, let's all calm down.

298
00:19:53,406 --> 00:19:57,035
Let's just not overdramatize
the situation.

299
00:19:57,109 --> 00:19:59,009
Why is he calming down?

300
00:20:01,013 --> 00:20:02,571
Everybody dies.

301
00:20:05,618 --> 00:20:09,110
Yeah, but usually at the end of their life,
and just the once and forever.

302
00:20:09,188 --> 00:20:10,849
Everybody's different.

303
00:20:10,923 --> 00:20:12,686
And you weren't even gonna tell me.

304
00:20:12,758 --> 00:20:14,658
- No, we did tell you. We told you...
- No, you didn't.

305
00:20:14,727 --> 00:20:16,627
We told you that night.
We gave you the full report.

306
00:20:16,696 --> 00:20:19,995
- No, I don't remember that.
- Yes. Yeah, we...

307
00:20:20,066 --> 00:20:24,400
It says here that you gurgled to me

308
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:28,372
before you rolled your eyes back
in your head, a little bit.

309
00:20:32,378 --> 00:20:36,542
Have you any idea
how much I'm gonna sue you for?

310
00:20:36,616 --> 00:20:38,948
- Nothing, I'm afraid.
- He's perked up. Go on.

311
00:20:39,018 --> 00:20:41,145
You signed a general release
and a quitclaim form,

312
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,347
relieving your surgeon,
your anesthesiologist,

313
00:20:43,422 --> 00:20:46,118
Saint Victor's Hospital and Cooperative
Institutional Health Partners

314
00:20:46,192 --> 00:20:47,489
from any liability related

315
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,585
to your anesthetic-induced cessation
of heart function.

316
00:20:49,695 --> 00:20:51,287
I definitely did not.

317
00:20:51,364 --> 00:20:54,424
- Is this your signature at the bottom?
- When did I sign that?

318
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,934
Right after you passed
the post-operative responsiveness test,

319
00:20:57,003 --> 00:20:58,903
legally mandated
by the state of New York.

320
00:20:58,971 --> 00:21:01,132
Obviously I didn't know
what I was doing!

321
00:21:01,207 --> 00:21:02,834
You knew enough to sign your name.

322
00:21:02,908 --> 00:21:05,809
I dotted the "i" with a little love heart!

323
00:21:05,878 --> 00:21:08,312
You were happy to be alive, right?

324
00:21:09,348 --> 00:21:12,943
Now, about these hallucinations.
What are you seeing?

325
00:21:13,019 --> 00:21:14,213
People.

326
00:21:31,937 --> 00:21:33,461
Hey, got a sec?

327
00:21:37,176 --> 00:21:40,111
Never get used to that.
You're the guy, huh?

328
00:21:40,179 --> 00:21:43,307
No. I'm not the guy.
It's another guy. Go away.

329
00:21:43,382 --> 00:21:45,373
Real quick, got to hit you up for a favor.

330
00:21:45,451 --> 00:21:48,215
No, no, no, no.
No, he's still there. Unbelievable.

331
00:21:48,287 --> 00:21:51,188
- Thank you!
- Good, excellent. Thank you!

332
00:21:51,257 --> 00:21:52,849
Hey. Wait a minute. Wait, what?

333
00:21:52,925 --> 00:21:55,257
- Drive!
- No, no, no.

334
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:57,159
- Where to, buddy?
- Don't do that!

335
00:21:57,229 --> 00:21:59,527
You're a busy little guy.
Let me get right to the point.

336
00:21:59,598 --> 00:22:01,498
That woman whose cab
you just snaked, that's my wife.

337
00:22:01,567 --> 00:22:03,364
- That's perfect.
- My widow.

338
00:22:03,436 --> 00:22:07,270
She's got a very serious problem.
I need your help to fix it.

339
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:09,774
- Where do you want to go, pal?
- Tell him 54th and Madison.

340
00:22:09,842 --> 00:22:11,707
I don't want to go to 54th and Madison!

341
00:22:11,777 --> 00:22:13,176
Okay, that narrows it down.

342
00:22:13,346 --> 00:22:15,177
I don't want a Sapphire martini
up with olives.

343
00:22:15,247 --> 00:22:17,442
Okay, that narrows it down.

344
00:22:17,516 --> 00:22:19,143
Yeah, you're making kind of a fool
out of yourself.

345
00:22:19,218 --> 00:22:21,243
You can't talk to me
when somebody's standing there.

346
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,982
- Campari and soda.
- Campari soda.

347
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:26,048
No.

348
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,461
- Pimm's Cup.
- Pimm's Cup.

349
00:22:30,529 --> 00:22:33,225
Pimm's Cup? Pimm's?

350
00:22:33,299 --> 00:22:34,823
- Just get a real drink.
- Shut the fuck up!

351
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,561
Okay! Sorry.

352
00:22:36,635 --> 00:22:40,571
Can I have the first thing I said?

353
00:22:40,639 --> 00:22:42,971
Sapphire martini up with olives.

354
00:22:46,979 --> 00:22:49,607
- Shut up.
- Wow. You need to adjust, right?

355
00:22:49,682 --> 00:22:51,115
No, it's okay, it's okay.

356
00:22:51,183 --> 00:22:53,651
It's okay.
You need a little time to adjust. I get it.

357
00:22:53,719 --> 00:22:55,152
I haven't done jack in 14 months.

358
00:22:55,221 --> 00:22:58,816
- I've been here, believe me, I can wait...
- I died today!

359
00:23:01,293 --> 00:23:02,954
What do you mean?

360
00:23:03,629 --> 00:23:06,257
- I was dead. For seven minutes.
- Yeah?

361
00:23:07,099 --> 00:23:08,999
And then when they brought me back,
I can...

362
00:23:09,068 --> 00:23:11,935
Yeah, well, look, that's the thing.
New York is lousy with ghosts.

363
00:23:12,004 --> 00:23:13,767
I mean, they're everywhere,

364
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:16,467
and they're a noisy,
pushy, demanding bunch,

365
00:23:16,542 --> 00:23:19,204
same as when they were alive,
and frustrated, too.

366
00:23:19,278 --> 00:23:20,677
The dead have
a lot of unfinished business,

367
00:23:20,746 --> 00:23:22,611
which is why we're still here.

368
00:23:22,681 --> 00:23:24,876
And normally, we can't talk to the living

369
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:27,316
and, suddenly, you come along,
and you can imagine.

370
00:23:27,386 --> 00:23:29,286
A lot of excitement.

371
00:23:29,355 --> 00:23:31,516
Why are you dressed like that?
Were you a maÏïtre d'?

372
00:23:31,624 --> 00:23:33,387
- I'm gonna ignore that, okay?
- You shouldn't.

373
00:23:33,459 --> 00:23:35,791
You wear what you died in.
At least I look nice.

374
00:23:35,861 --> 00:23:38,193
- Sapphire martini up with olives.
- Thank you.

375
00:23:38,264 --> 00:23:39,595
- Drink your drink.
- I'm gonna drink my drink.

376
00:23:39,665 --> 00:23:41,656
- All right.
- Just shut up.

377
00:23:42,401 --> 00:23:44,335
Aesthetically pleasing.

378
00:23:45,037 --> 00:23:47,130
Am I still dead? I'm still dead, aren't I?

379
00:23:47,206 --> 00:23:49,299
This is heaven.
Can't be heaven, you wouldn't be here.

380
00:23:49,375 --> 00:23:52,344
I'm lying on the operating table,
they're gonna bring me around, and...

381
00:23:52,411 --> 00:23:54,276
It's all gonna be a dream.

382
00:23:54,346 --> 00:23:58,248
Yeah. Don't overthink it.
You were gone, now you're back.

383
00:23:58,317 --> 00:24:01,411
Have a drink. Have another one.
God knows I would if I could.

384
00:24:01,487 --> 00:24:04,684
- You can take your BlackBerry with you?
- I guess.

385
00:24:04,757 --> 00:24:05,985
What, have you got a signal?

386
00:24:06,058 --> 00:24:08,083
- Not yet, but I keep trying.
- Not yet.

387
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:11,186
Thank goodness
I downloaded Tetris before I went.

388
00:24:11,263 --> 00:24:13,322
Damn it! How'd you die?

389
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:15,561
Something went wrong
with the anesthetic.

390
00:24:15,634 --> 00:24:17,727
I went in for a colonoscopy
and it went all...

391
00:24:17,803 --> 00:24:18,827
Yeah, I never got one of those.

392
00:24:18,904 --> 00:24:19,928
I don't think
you have to worry about it now.

393
00:24:20,005 --> 00:24:22,303
- What kind of anesthetic did they use?
- They didn't want to use any.

394
00:24:22,374 --> 00:24:23,374
- What?
- Yeah.

395
00:24:23,442 --> 00:24:24,807
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

396
00:24:24,877 --> 00:24:27,710
- Expected me...
- What about your ass feelings?

397
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:31,773
Don't actually say "ass feelings. "
I knew what you meant with that.

398
00:24:31,851 --> 00:24:34,684
- Lf we're gonna be hanging out, I just...
- We're not gonna be hanging out!

399
00:24:34,753 --> 00:24:36,550
May I ask you a question, young man?

400
00:24:36,622 --> 00:24:39,750
It's about my daughter.
She lives in Far Rockaway.

401
00:24:39,825 --> 00:24:42,726
- She won't speak to her sister...
- Back off, Marjorie!

402
00:24:42,795 --> 00:24:45,025
All right? I'm talking to him.
Whatever you do, don't talk to them.

403
00:24:45,097 --> 00:24:47,827
I certainly see no harm
in making a request of the young man.

404
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,629
How about the fact
that I found him first?

405
00:24:49,702 --> 00:24:53,763
Look what you did. You upset him.
No, no, you, you, you, you, you.

406
00:25:06,752 --> 00:25:09,380
Yeah, very good. I know you're there.

407
00:25:09,455 --> 00:25:12,151
Let's start over, huh? Come on.

408
00:25:12,224 --> 00:25:14,055
You had a rough day.
You're tense, you're keyed up.

409
00:25:14,126 --> 00:25:16,617
You do yoga? You do yoga?

410
00:25:16,695 --> 00:25:18,595
My girlfriend's got a studio.
I'll show you where it is.

411
00:25:18,664 --> 00:25:20,859
Girlfriend?
I thought you said you were married.

412
00:25:20,933 --> 00:25:22,366
Did I say I was a perfect person?

413
00:25:22,434 --> 00:25:25,028
- Come on, let's hail a cab. She's hot.
- You don't exist, okay?

414
00:25:25,104 --> 00:25:27,937
You're the bizarre aftereffects
of some poorly-administered anesthetic.

415
00:25:28,007 --> 00:25:30,305
I'm gonna go home to bed,
and when I wake up in the morning,

416
00:25:30,376 --> 00:25:32,276
with any luck, you'll be gone.

417
00:25:32,344 --> 00:25:34,005
That would be truly rotten luck
for my wife

418
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:36,240
who just needs a little bit of your help.

419
00:25:36,315 --> 00:25:39,148
- Lf you would come through for me...
- I'm not listening anymore.

420
00:25:39,218 --> 00:25:41,880
Hey, I don't want to play hardball
with you, but I will if I have to.

421
00:25:41,954 --> 00:25:43,444
- It's Pink-Ass, right?
- Pincus.

422
00:25:43,522 --> 00:25:46,150
Pincus? Pincus?
This is a matter of life or death.

423
00:25:46,225 --> 00:25:47,715
- It's my wife, okay? She lives right...
- Widow.

424
00:25:47,793 --> 00:25:49,693
She lives right here in this building,
all right?

425
00:25:49,762 --> 00:25:50,990
She's getting married
in a couple of months

426
00:25:51,063 --> 00:25:53,327
to a real scumbag lawyer,
a bad, bad guy.

427
00:25:53,399 --> 00:25:54,423
Somebody's got to stop this.

428
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,832
What do you care?
You were having an affair.

429
00:25:56,902 --> 00:25:59,996
Never been married, right? Okay.
You need time.

430
00:26:00,072 --> 00:26:02,540
- It's all right, I can take a hint.
- It's not a hint.

431
00:26:02,608 --> 00:26:05,543
- Good evening, Dr. Pincus.
- Just go to hell.

432
00:26:53,258 --> 00:26:55,021
- What?
- Is this a bad time?

433
00:26:55,094 --> 00:26:56,857
My letter went under the carpet.

434
00:26:56,929 --> 00:26:59,397
He lost something important,
and I know where it is.

435
00:26:59,465 --> 00:27:02,025
She won't wear a helmet
because of me, but that's nuts!

436
00:27:06,338 --> 00:27:07,362
Gee, I'm sorry, Doctor,

437
00:27:07,439 --> 00:27:10,738
did I accidentally give everybody
your home address?

438
00:27:16,782 --> 00:27:19,307
If you don't help her, she won't...

439
00:27:20,085 --> 00:27:23,782
I got to tell you, nobody was
more excited than Naked Guy. He's...

440
00:27:32,564 --> 00:27:34,122
Leave me alone.

441
00:27:35,134 --> 00:27:37,432
- Dr. Pincus?
- Back off!

442
00:27:37,503 --> 00:27:40,233
- Sorry?
- Oh, sorry. Never mind.

443
00:27:42,875 --> 00:27:45,275
- Bless you.
- Oh, God. Thank you.

444
00:27:47,479 --> 00:27:51,839
- Bless you.
- Thank you.

445
00:27:52,584 --> 00:27:53,778
- Bless you.
- Stop it.

446
00:27:53,852 --> 00:27:56,844
If I sneeze again, I'll assume...
Thank you. Just...

447
00:27:56,922 --> 00:28:00,289
I'm not very well. It's not you.
It's a bit you.

448
00:28:01,293 --> 00:28:05,024
Mainly... You can't... But you're adding.

449
00:28:08,901 --> 00:28:11,335
Don't you see, Pincus,
there's a reason I'm here and this is it.

450
00:28:11,403 --> 00:28:15,703
I mean, this slimeball, he's using Gwen,
trying to get his hands on her money.

451
00:28:15,774 --> 00:28:17,298
I left her a good chunk of change,
you know.

452
00:28:17,376 --> 00:28:20,072
- My head. It's throbbing.
- I'm like her guardian angel.

453
00:28:20,145 --> 00:28:21,635
You can be
the guardian angel's assistant.

454
00:28:21,714 --> 00:28:22,714
- Pass.
- What?

455
00:28:22,781 --> 00:28:23,907
You don't want to help me
earn my wings?

456
00:28:23,982 --> 00:28:25,210
I don't care.

457
00:28:25,284 --> 00:28:28,583
- You don't want to at least help Gwen?
- She's beyond help, okay?

458
00:28:28,654 --> 00:28:30,019
She chose you, didn't she?

459
00:28:30,089 --> 00:28:32,649
And now she's got a new slimeball,
and if that doesn't work out,

460
00:28:32,725 --> 00:28:34,625
I'm sure another Mr. Wrong
will come along,

461
00:28:34,693 --> 00:28:35,921
'cause that seems to be her thing.

462
00:28:35,994 --> 00:28:38,292
Now, leave me alone.

463
00:28:38,363 --> 00:28:40,524
I've got a crown at 8:00 a. m.

464
00:28:41,967 --> 00:28:45,664
I see! I understand, I get it.

465
00:28:45,738 --> 00:28:49,037
- What? What do you get?
- You. Just this whole self-loathing thing.

466
00:28:49,108 --> 00:28:51,076
- No, it's you I loathe.
- Oh, please.

467
00:28:51,143 --> 00:28:52,804
Frankie spent some time on the couch.

468
00:28:52,878 --> 00:28:54,470
You know, dentists have
one of the highest suicide rates

469
00:28:54,546 --> 00:28:55,604
of any other profession.

470
00:28:55,681 --> 00:28:57,080
But this might really give you a chance

471
00:28:57,149 --> 00:28:59,174
- to connect with another human being...
- Shut up. Shut up!

472
00:28:59,251 --> 00:29:02,311
Okay? Don't you understand?
I don't give a shit! I like what I do.

473
00:29:02,387 --> 00:29:04,082
Do you know why? It suits me.

474
00:29:04,156 --> 00:29:06,215
Because 90%% % of the people
I come into contact with

475
00:29:06,291 --> 00:29:08,225
have cotton wool
shoved in their mouths.

476
00:29:08,293 --> 00:29:10,318
I'm not interested
in their political opinions.

477
00:29:10,395 --> 00:29:12,260
<i>I don't care
what they thought of Spamalot.</i>

478
00:29:12,331 --> 00:29:16,028
I don't care about their lives.
I just like the quiet!

479
00:29:17,069 --> 00:29:18,832
You are a sad little man.

480
00:29:18,904 --> 00:29:21,304
- And you're a lying, bigamist corpse.
- No, no, I'm not a bigamist.

481
00:29:21,373 --> 00:29:22,738
I'm an adulterer.
It's a whole different thing.

482
00:29:22,808 --> 00:29:26,107
Sorry, my mistake.
You were a real catch.

483
00:29:26,178 --> 00:29:29,636
Come on. You don't think
I'm gonna find you in a hotel?

484
00:29:33,352 --> 00:29:34,944
This is crazy, all right?

485
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:38,012
You want your quiet life back?
I'll make you a deal. Okay?

486
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:40,820
I'll talk to them for you,
get them to leave you alone.

487
00:29:40,893 --> 00:29:43,487
I'm good at talking people into things.
It's what I do.

488
00:29:43,562 --> 00:29:44,620
Did.

489
00:29:46,465 --> 00:29:47,727
Look, you do this one thing for me,

490
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,701
you'll never see any of us
ever again, okay?

491
00:29:52,905 --> 00:29:54,429
Problem solved.

492
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:58,310
Yeah, okay.

493
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:04,708
<i>The mummy's been examined
by virologists,</i>

494
00:30:04,783 --> 00:30:07,047
<i>oncologists, forensic pathologists,</i>

495
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:09,383
<i>searching for signs of foul play,</i>

496
00:30:09,454 --> 00:30:14,050
but Pepi the Third's cause of death
at the relatively young age of 23

497
00:30:14,126 --> 00:30:15,753
still remains a mystery.

498
00:30:15,828 --> 00:30:17,591
It can't be that hard
to break up a relationship.

499
00:30:17,663 --> 00:30:19,426
I used to screw
these things up all the time.

500
00:30:19,498 --> 00:30:22,592
Maybe we ought to just hire a broad to
seduce him and videotape it, you know?

501
00:30:22,668 --> 00:30:23,828
That woman lives in my building?

502
00:30:23,902 --> 00:30:26,871
Or we send her an anonymous letter
from his other family.

503
00:30:26,939 --> 00:30:28,600
- I've never seen her before.
- One of those things?

504
00:30:28,674 --> 00:30:31,302
- You stole her cab, remember?
- I've never noticed her, then.

505
00:30:31,376 --> 00:30:33,776
Never noticed her?
Open your eyes, man.

506
00:30:33,846 --> 00:30:35,871
What are you, a brain in a jar?

507
00:30:35,948 --> 00:30:37,916
Okay.
I want to hear what she's got to say.

508
00:30:37,983 --> 00:30:39,143
- Really?
- Yes.

509
00:30:39,218 --> 00:30:44,019
And the grand manner in which
Mummy 1999.1.4 was preserved

510
00:30:44,089 --> 00:30:48,321
also suggests that he was embalmed
by royal mummifiers,

511
00:30:48,393 --> 00:30:51,829
as opposed to
curbside-marketplace perverts...

512
00:30:51,897 --> 00:30:53,296
Preservists.

513
00:30:54,166 --> 00:30:55,326
That's awkward.

514
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,892
I suppose
the simplest way to break it up

515
00:30:58,971 --> 00:31:01,838
would be to plant a seed of doubt
in her mind.

516
00:31:01,907 --> 00:31:04,967
- Give her another option.
- I don't get it.

517
00:31:05,043 --> 00:31:07,705
- Present her with an alternative.
- Yeah, yeah, I thought of that.

518
00:31:07,779 --> 00:31:09,508
You mean hire
a good-looking male model...

519
00:31:09,581 --> 00:31:12,243
Don't hire anyone. Don't...
No, don't need...

520
00:31:12,317 --> 00:31:14,683
- Don't need a male model or a fireman.
- Somebody handsome, right?

521
00:31:14,753 --> 00:31:17,551
Not too handsome. Not chiseled,
just approachable. Sort of...

522
00:31:17,623 --> 00:31:19,955
'Cause I was thinking, like,
rugged and somebody tough.

523
00:31:20,025 --> 00:31:23,085
...round-faced, if anything and sensitive.

524
00:31:23,161 --> 00:31:24,822
Well, he's gonna have to have
a lot of cash, though.

525
00:31:24,897 --> 00:31:26,387
If he's sensible with his money,

526
00:31:26,465 --> 00:31:28,296
he's probably invested well,
and that would be attractive.

527
00:31:28,367 --> 00:31:30,028
- Really?
- Yeah.

528
00:31:30,102 --> 00:31:31,729
- She might like that.
- Yeah.

529
00:31:31,803 --> 00:31:33,566
But he's gonna have to be tall.
Tall is important.

530
00:31:33,639 --> 00:31:35,732
No, no, no, no, no, he's not.
No, no. Average.

531
00:31:35,807 --> 00:31:38,503
- Really?
- Yeah. Bordering on the short.

532
00:31:39,344 --> 00:31:41,369
Oh, my word, you mean you.

533
00:31:46,652 --> 00:31:47,983
- I'm... Hey! Hey! Hey!
- Forget it.

534
00:31:48,053 --> 00:31:52,251
Don't walk away mad!
Come here! Pink-Ass!

535
00:31:52,357 --> 00:31:59,286
I would like to elaborate further on
Mummy 1999.1.4's burial site. Here...

536
00:31:59,531 --> 00:32:01,089
- I'm sorry.
- Forget it.

537
00:32:01,166 --> 00:32:05,068
That's okay. I mean, a lot of great ideas
sound completely ridiculous at first.

538
00:32:05,137 --> 00:32:06,331
Sorry I even brought it up.

539
00:32:06,405 --> 00:32:09,568
I'm still thinking about it.
You know, it might work.

540
00:32:09,641 --> 00:32:11,438
I mean, all you're gonna have to do
is be charming enough

541
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:15,071
to give her a few second thoughts,
you know?

542
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:16,738
Be a challenge.

543
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:20,545
Almost impossible.

544
00:32:20,652 --> 00:32:23,120
But I'd be there, you know?
Pulling the strings.

545
00:32:23,188 --> 00:32:27,784
Guy in the bushes calling the plays.
You know, I think I can do it.

546
00:32:28,961 --> 00:32:34,092
- Really. I can do this. I can do it.
- Forget it.

547
00:32:34,166 --> 00:32:35,963
No, no, no, you're not...
You're not married, are you?

548
00:32:36,034 --> 00:32:38,969
- Good God, no.
- No? You got a girlfriend?

549
00:32:39,037 --> 00:32:43,599
No, just between us, currently.

550
00:32:44,676 --> 00:32:49,579
- So you use hookers.
- No, I don't use hookers.

551
00:32:49,648 --> 00:32:52,583
We've also conducted
extensive CT scans

552
00:32:52,651 --> 00:32:55,984
to search for orthopedic trauma,
which may have led to infection,

553
00:32:56,054 --> 00:32:59,182
as you may remember was the case
with Tutankhamen

554
00:32:59,257 --> 00:33:02,090
as shown here on slide 43.

555
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,388
Nope, nope, you know what?

556
00:33:03,462 --> 00:33:05,020
It's possible
that she could actually go for you.

557
00:33:05,097 --> 00:33:09,591
I mean, she likes athletic guys.
I mean, you work out or...

558
00:33:09,668 --> 00:33:10,965
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

559
00:33:11,036 --> 00:33:14,164
- Twice a week. Free weights.
- Okay. All right.

560
00:33:14,272 --> 00:33:16,866
- You got a nice, thick head of hair.
- Protein shampoo.

561
00:33:16,942 --> 00:33:18,239
- She's gonna like that.
- Yeah.

562
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:20,039
- Look after your scalp.
- Right.

563
00:33:20,112 --> 00:33:22,239
All we got to do is find a way
to get you two together, you know?

564
00:33:22,314 --> 00:33:27,251
At her apartment, you show up as
the cable guy or innocent pizza boy or...

565
00:33:27,319 --> 00:33:29,913
- You watch a lot of porn, don't you?
- No.

566
00:33:29,988 --> 00:33:34,391
I was inclined to regard this injury
as the result of attempts by plunderers

567
00:33:34,459 --> 00:33:37,155
to hastily remove
the wrappings from the mummy.

568
00:33:37,229 --> 00:33:38,253
I tell you what I'm gonna do.

569
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:39,797
I'm gonna go over there
when she's finished,

570
00:33:39,865 --> 00:33:42,527
and strike up a conversation with her.

571
00:33:43,702 --> 00:33:45,431
- Yeah.
- I know.

572
00:33:47,072 --> 00:33:49,472
- What?
- I don't know.

573
00:33:49,574 --> 00:33:52,202
I'm just thinking,
in the smock, better not.

574
00:33:52,277 --> 00:33:53,608
- Yes. I came straight from work.
- Okay.

575
00:33:53,678 --> 00:33:56,670
- I'm a dentist. This is what we wear.
- Yeah. Yeah.

576
00:33:56,748 --> 00:34:00,240
- This is how we do it, baby.
- Okay.

577
00:34:01,253 --> 00:34:05,019
And remember that the show officially
opens on Friday, the 12th.

578
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:07,888
Thank you,
thank you very much for coming.

579
00:34:14,499 --> 00:34:17,696
You know, it's an interesting story.
My daughter went to Egypt.

580
00:34:17,769 --> 00:34:20,067
- Oh, really? Did she?
- Oh, yeah.

581
00:34:22,374 --> 00:34:23,966
Good, all right.

582
00:34:27,345 --> 00:34:29,370
I owe you an apology.

583
00:34:31,716 --> 00:34:35,675
Do you mean for stealing my cab
or for not holding the elevator?

584
00:34:36,354 --> 00:34:37,912
- Don't remember the second one.
- Oh, no, no. I know.

585
00:34:37,989 --> 00:34:39,581
Maybe it was for that time that

586
00:34:39,658 --> 00:34:42,650
you told the super that
somebody down on nine was cooking

587
00:34:42,727 --> 00:34:46,060
stenchy ethnic food
that stings the eyes?

588
00:34:46,131 --> 00:34:48,429
- Was that you?
- It was tacos.

589
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:52,436
They told me that any complaints
would be kept anonymous.

590
00:34:52,537 --> 00:34:56,530
Or, you know, maybe it was for
the eight or ten times that I said,

591
00:34:56,608 --> 00:35:00,305
"Hello," or "Good morning" or whatever,
and you never even looked at me.

592
00:35:00,745 --> 00:35:02,679
I'm a very private person.

593
00:35:02,747 --> 00:35:05,739
What you are is a little bit of a jerk.

594
00:35:07,052 --> 00:35:09,680
- Bertram Pincus, D.D.S.
- So I've read.

595
00:35:12,924 --> 00:35:16,951
- I enjoyed your lecture very much.
- Thank you.

596
00:35:17,963 --> 00:35:22,400
- Don't take the walk-outs personally.
- I hadn't noticed.

597
00:35:22,467 --> 00:35:26,062
But, you know,
thank you for that encouragement.

598
00:35:26,138 --> 00:35:29,073
Quite a few, quite a few.
What do they know?

599
00:35:32,444 --> 00:35:34,571
- Atrocious dental hygiene.
- I'm sorry?

600
00:35:34,646 --> 00:35:37,615
Your mummy. 1999.1.4.

601
00:35:37,682 --> 00:35:39,377
He was no flosser.

602
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:43,110
Dental humor.

603
00:35:45,223 --> 00:35:47,214
Is there something else?

604
00:35:50,862 --> 00:35:56,232
Shoes. Your shoes are comfortable.

605
00:35:57,302 --> 00:35:58,394
Bye.

606
00:36:02,474 --> 00:36:04,374
<i>I knew you were gonna come off scary.</i>

607
00:36:04,442 --> 00:36:06,603
I wasn't scary.
I caught her at a bad time.

608
00:36:06,678 --> 00:36:09,272
- Right, and it scared her.
- I'm not scary!

609
00:36:09,347 --> 00:36:10,939
Don't make eye contact.

610
00:36:11,016 --> 00:36:13,280
Let me... No, no, no.
Let me preface this.

611
00:36:13,351 --> 00:36:15,216
- What the hell is your problem?
- I don't have a problem.

612
00:36:15,287 --> 00:36:16,845
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.
- No, no.

613
00:36:16,922 --> 00:36:19,049
You got a big problem.
Big problem with women.

614
00:36:19,124 --> 00:36:20,853
No, I take it back.
You got a problem with people.

615
00:36:20,926 --> 00:36:24,157
- Yeah, they suck.
- Would you quit banging that drum?

616
00:36:24,229 --> 00:36:27,323
What's the drama? Some big, bad lady
went and broke your heart?

617
00:36:27,432 --> 00:36:28,626
Well, get over it. It's in the past.

618
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:29,997
You know nothing about my past,
do you?

619
00:36:30,068 --> 00:36:32,434
I know you got to forget about this
and let it go.

620
00:36:32,504 --> 00:36:33,869
It's not helping you out there.

621
00:36:33,939 --> 00:36:35,406
Listen, the thing with women
is that they...

622
00:36:35,473 --> 00:36:38,101
I do fine with women.
Thanks very much.

623
00:36:39,177 --> 00:36:41,611
You know, for the sake of time,
I'm gonna agree with that insane point,

624
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,910
and say, "Yeah, you do great
with women. You do great. "

625
00:36:43,982 --> 00:36:47,179
But you stink with this one.
So we got work to do.

626
00:36:49,421 --> 00:36:51,150
And she likes a man who's a man.

627
00:36:51,223 --> 00:36:54,420
She likes you to order for her
in a restaurant. And don't get bossy!

628
00:36:54,492 --> 00:36:55,982
Don't ever tell her
to take it easy, Pincus.

629
00:36:56,061 --> 00:36:58,757
- This will make her absolutely nuts.
- Yeah.

630
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:01,162
I do know how to talk to people.

631
00:37:02,033 --> 00:37:05,434
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, you got a gift, don't you? Yeah.

632
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:07,260
Once you're with her,
you got to show her you care.

633
00:37:07,339 --> 00:37:09,705
You got to be jealous,
got to be suspicious.

634
00:37:09,774 --> 00:37:11,799
Why on earth would I do that?

635
00:37:11,876 --> 00:37:13,309
'Cause it shows you're interested.

636
00:37:13,378 --> 00:37:17,109
This is the worst advice
I've ever had in my life.

637
00:37:17,182 --> 00:37:19,810
But she's jealous, too,
and she's no dummy.

638
00:37:19,884 --> 00:37:24,116
She thinks you're lying, she'll raise
one eyebrow and cock her head.

639
00:37:24,189 --> 00:37:27,647
I call it her pirate look.
Rattles the hell out of you.

640
00:37:30,629 --> 00:37:32,859
- Hi.
- I'm gonna get the next one.

641
00:37:32,931 --> 00:37:35,195
Don't be silly. Get in here.

642
00:37:35,267 --> 00:37:37,064
I don't want to... Okay.

643
00:37:38,236 --> 00:37:39,396
Pincus.

644
00:37:41,072 --> 00:37:45,065
Okay, just don't say anything.
No, no, no, no, no, you're not ready.

645
00:37:45,143 --> 00:37:48,135
You're not ready.
Just ride in silence, okay?

646
00:37:48,213 --> 00:37:52,582
Don't do this. And get that face off.
You're not... Don't do it!

647
00:37:53,518 --> 00:37:57,181
I've been thinking
about your decaying jawbone.

648
00:37:57,255 --> 00:37:58,449
Pitting is what I'm talking.

649
00:37:58,523 --> 00:37:59,854
Saw it on the slideshow,

650
00:37:59,924 --> 00:38:04,224
which would indicate to me,
a trained dentist, some bone loss,

651
00:38:04,296 --> 00:38:07,663
and on the upper left
mandibular gum line.

652
00:38:07,732 --> 00:38:08,926
The mummy.

653
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,128
Open invitation to a little vitis
called "Gingi. "

654
00:38:12,203 --> 00:38:13,602
Gingivitis?

655
00:38:14,472 --> 00:38:18,101
More dental humor.
This time bone-based, but essentially...

656
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:22,941
Check out the mandibular bone loss,
if I...

657
00:38:23,014 --> 00:38:26,177
But wouldn't that just be
ordinary wear and tear?

658
00:38:27,719 --> 00:38:30,711
Not if it's only on one side, you idiot.

659
00:38:30,789 --> 00:38:32,381
I don't think so.

660
00:38:32,457 --> 00:38:35,119
How do the ladies resist
that rap of yours?

661
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:45,563
All right, all right. Not a total disaster.

662
00:38:45,637 --> 00:38:47,901
Next time, you just got to listen
to what it is that I'm saying.

663
00:38:47,972 --> 00:38:49,769
Excuse me?

664
00:38:49,841 --> 00:38:54,437
Do you think maybe you could come by
someday and maybe examine him?

665
00:38:54,512 --> 00:38:56,673
Let's have a look, shall we?

666
00:39:01,953 --> 00:39:03,477
- Okay.
- Okay.

667
00:39:03,555 --> 00:39:06,547
No, today's out, tomorrow is out. That.

668
00:39:06,624 --> 00:39:10,788
Cannot move that. Cannot move that.
That is set in stone.

669
00:39:10,862 --> 00:39:14,059
And that little puppy
is hunkered in good.

670
00:39:14,132 --> 00:39:16,123
Hunkerty, dunkerty, dock.

671
00:39:16,968 --> 00:39:22,929
I don't want to move that,
but I can't do that, either.

672
00:39:23,007 --> 00:39:24,440
Busy bee.

673
00:39:24,509 --> 00:39:27,137
- It's okay.
- It seems to me, I think, commitments

674
00:39:27,212 --> 00:39:28,873
abound.

675
00:39:29,647 --> 00:39:35,586
Pack 'em in, move 'em out, Rawhide.
No way is that gonna...

676
00:39:37,856 --> 00:39:41,724
- For the love of God!
- 4:00 Thursday seems totally free, so...

677
00:39:42,527 --> 00:39:46,554
- Great. Okay.
- Good. See you then.

678
00:40:01,346 --> 00:40:04,509
Way to go, Frank. Oh, God.

679
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:09,844
Oh, thank God you're back.

680
00:40:09,921 --> 00:40:12,151
You left the newspaper
on a cell phone ad, you sadist!

681
00:40:12,223 --> 00:40:14,191
- I'm sorry.
- No, forget it.

682
00:40:14,259 --> 00:40:16,386
I'm not in the mood anymore.

683
00:40:17,962 --> 00:40:20,260
Where have you been?

684
00:40:20,331 --> 00:40:23,858
I sit around here all day long,
and you're out God knows where.

685
00:40:23,935 --> 00:40:26,062
You meet interesting people.
You have a career.

686
00:40:26,137 --> 00:40:28,037
Hey, is that a new shirt?

687
00:40:28,106 --> 00:40:30,768
Hey, it is a new shirt,
and it's got sleeves.

688
00:40:30,842 --> 00:40:34,938
Well, well, well. Pinky's got himself
a brand new shirt for the big...

689
00:41:03,241 --> 00:41:05,368
Hi. Hi.

690
00:41:07,345 --> 00:41:08,778
Yeah, it's my yacht, yeah.

691
00:41:16,521 --> 00:41:18,648
Quite the little heartbreaker, huh?

692
00:41:18,723 --> 00:41:22,124
You should have seen the state
he was in when we found him.

693
00:41:22,193 --> 00:41:25,993
Blackened skin, multiple fractures
from extensive marauding,

694
00:41:26,064 --> 00:41:27,463
fully retreated lips.

695
00:41:27,532 --> 00:41:30,899
Five thousand years of acid reflux
will do that to you.

696
00:41:32,937 --> 00:41:37,374
Deep down, you know, the preservation
was exquisite New Kingdom work,

697
00:41:37,442 --> 00:41:40,138
and it's what's underneath that counts.

698
00:41:40,945 --> 00:41:44,244
First, they suctioned his brain out
through his nose.

699
00:41:44,315 --> 00:41:46,749
And then they make a slit
in the side of the abdomen,

700
00:41:46,818 --> 00:41:50,515
so that they can remove
the stomach, liver, intestines...

701
00:41:50,588 --> 00:41:51,680
Beautiful.

702
00:41:51,756 --> 00:41:54,190
...so that they could be separately
preserved in Canopic jars.

703
00:41:54,259 --> 00:41:58,286
But what's really exciting about Pepi is
how they handled his organ.

704
00:41:58,396 --> 00:42:00,489
- His organ?
- Yeah, his dick.

705
00:42:01,165 --> 00:42:03,793
I got it right here. You wanna see it?

706
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:06,698
Please.

707
00:42:07,705 --> 00:42:11,539
There's nothing unusual
about the phallus itself.

708
00:42:11,609 --> 00:42:13,270
- Sure.
- It's the way it was stored.

709
00:42:13,344 --> 00:42:15,904
You know, normally, the penis
and the heart are kept together

710
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:17,971
and mummified along with the body,

711
00:42:18,049 --> 00:42:19,175
but in Pepi's case,

712
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:24,552
they removed it and preserved it
in this separate gold-encrusted jar.

713
00:42:25,957 --> 00:42:29,222
God. I can see why he was king.

714
00:42:29,294 --> 00:42:30,386
- You okay?
- Yeah.

715
00:42:30,461 --> 00:42:33,055
I've got to get used to looking down
at a shriveled, old penis, eventually.

716
00:42:33,131 --> 00:42:36,396
Oh, geez. I see he died happy.

717
00:42:38,036 --> 00:42:39,970
That's it. That's enough.

718
00:42:40,038 --> 00:42:41,300
He must have had huge hands.

719
00:42:41,372 --> 00:42:43,340
- No, no.
- Yeah.

720
00:42:43,408 --> 00:42:45,672
Is this here the pitting
that you were referring to?

721
00:42:45,743 --> 00:42:50,043
Yeah.
Here, here, and look, really bad there.

722
00:42:50,114 --> 00:42:52,674
We just assumed
that was post-mortal decay.

723
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:54,775
Don't be naive.

724
00:42:54,852 --> 00:42:57,286
That is the work
of an untreated abscess.

725
00:42:57,355 --> 00:43:00,756
That was a absolute magic carpet
of bacterial infection.

726
00:43:00,825 --> 00:43:01,985
And that could have killed him?

727
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:04,722
Yeah, if it was severe, that would
have led to something more systemic,

728
00:43:04,796 --> 00:43:07,094
and as soon as the infection
hit the spinal column,

729
00:43:07,165 --> 00:43:10,259
he'd have pennies on his eyes
in no time at all.

730
00:43:10,335 --> 00:43:12,860
Well, the mouth. A coin in the mouth.

731
00:43:12,937 --> 00:43:14,962
It was a Greek tradition, you know,

732
00:43:15,039 --> 00:43:18,202
to pay the boatman to ferry you across
the River Styx, but...

733
00:43:18,276 --> 00:43:20,244
I mean,
this is an amazing breakthrough,

734
00:43:20,311 --> 00:43:22,506
and just in time
for our opening next Thursday.

735
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:24,741
- Hey, will you come?
- What?

736
00:43:24,816 --> 00:43:26,875
- Big opening with loads of people...
- Yeah.

737
00:43:26,951 --> 00:43:28,543
- No. That's...
- You don't like crowds?

738
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:33,023
It's not so much the crowd as
the individuals in the crowd I don't like.

739
00:43:33,558 --> 00:43:36,322
Well, if you change your mind,
you let me know.

740
00:43:37,495 --> 00:43:41,397
Just seems so obvious now.
Why didn't I call a dentist sooner?

741
00:43:41,466 --> 00:43:44,629
Everybody waits until it's too late.

742
00:43:44,702 --> 00:43:46,727
So you're a funny dentist.

743
00:43:48,706 --> 00:43:50,264
You wanna touch him?

744
00:43:50,341 --> 00:43:52,639
- This is my lucky day.
- Yeah.

745
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:56,146
- No, no. Really, really touch him. Yeah.
- More, yeah.

746
00:43:56,247 --> 00:43:58,238
- No, like...
- Down there.

747
00:43:58,316 --> 00:44:01,547
- Isn't that amazing?
- Wow. Brilliant.

748
00:44:04,422 --> 00:44:06,890
Don't you just love that smell?

749
00:44:07,659 --> 00:44:10,526
It's not decay. It's the resin. It's pine.

750
00:44:10,595 --> 00:44:13,530
- They imported it from North Africa.
- Oh, good.

751
00:44:14,766 --> 00:44:18,361
After a couple of hours,
the smell that was initially so sweet,

752
00:44:18,436 --> 00:44:20,870
it triggers your vomit impulse.

753
00:44:20,938 --> 00:44:22,997
Like visiting your grandmother.

754
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,941
Sugar-free treat?

755
00:44:32,316 --> 00:44:34,409
Sure. Okay.

756
00:44:36,521 --> 00:44:38,648
It's sweetened with Splenda.

757
00:44:44,062 --> 00:44:46,030
Surprisingly delightful.

758
00:44:47,198 --> 00:44:50,861
- Have you lived in the building long?
- Four years and one month.

759
00:44:50,935 --> 00:44:53,927
Originally born and raised in England,
obviously, and then...

760
00:44:54,005 --> 00:44:58,533
- Why'd you move?
- London. Just too much.

761
00:44:58,609 --> 00:45:03,137
Overcrowded, just no privacy.
Just too many people.

762
00:45:03,214 --> 00:45:05,614
So you picked Manhattan?

763
00:45:05,683 --> 00:45:09,847
The reasoning is a little bit convoluted.
It's difficult to explain.

764
00:45:10,822 --> 00:45:12,915
- What's her name?
- Sarah.

765
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:13,990
- Wife?
- No.

766
00:45:14,058 --> 00:45:15,525
- Girlfriend?
- Yeah.

767
00:45:15,593 --> 00:45:17,117
Still together?

768
00:45:17,895 --> 00:45:20,796
Possibly.
I haven't spoken to her for years.

769
00:45:21,632 --> 00:45:24,123
No, she died, actually. Quite sad.

770
00:45:24,202 --> 00:45:28,002
She had a rare condition.
Have you heard of auto-cannibalism?

771
00:45:28,072 --> 00:45:30,063
She actually ate herself.

772
00:45:32,009 --> 00:45:34,204
I made that up. I was joking.

773
00:45:35,046 --> 00:45:37,947
- But that's not funny.
- Funnier than the truth.

774
00:45:38,015 --> 00:45:42,076
- Okay, and the truth about Sarah is...
- Very boring and ordinary.

775
00:45:43,955 --> 00:45:45,946
How long you been here?

776
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:48,722
Can you just hold on one second?

777
00:45:48,793 --> 00:45:51,887
This is so stupid,
but my keychain broke,

778
00:45:51,963 --> 00:45:54,454
and I can never find my keys.

779
00:45:54,532 --> 00:45:59,469
I moved back to the city about
a year ago, just after my husband died.

780
00:46:00,304 --> 00:46:03,034
You lost your husband?
I'm sorry to hear that.

781
00:46:03,107 --> 00:46:04,335
Thanks.

782
00:46:06,744 --> 00:46:10,874
I want to ask you something,
and you tell me if it's inappropriate.

783
00:46:11,516 --> 00:46:12,642
Okay.

784
00:46:14,085 --> 00:46:15,177
Okay.

785
00:46:17,121 --> 00:46:18,645
This tooth.

786
00:46:18,723 --> 00:46:22,557
It kills whenever I drink anything cold.
I mean, it's just...

787
00:46:22,627 --> 00:46:26,757
- Should I make an appointment?
- No, just warm the drinks up.

788
00:46:26,831 --> 00:46:30,164
Let's have a look.
Head back. Open wide.

789
00:46:30,234 --> 00:46:32,225
You want me to say, "Ah"?

790
00:46:35,306 --> 00:46:36,568
Hey, Dentist!

791
00:46:36,641 --> 00:46:37,938
I need you to clip a guy for me.

792
00:46:38,009 --> 00:46:40,136
- Can you tell what it is?
- It's bad molar contact.

793
00:46:40,211 --> 00:46:41,235
You see, Dentist, in life,

794
00:46:41,312 --> 00:46:43,610
I accepted payment for a job
which I wasn't able to complete.

795
00:46:43,681 --> 00:46:46,912
Bad molar contact?
I mean, is it really very serious?

796
00:46:46,984 --> 00:46:48,542
- You should come and see me.
- Should I?

797
00:46:48,619 --> 00:46:49,643
- You have to finish it for me.
- Yeah.

798
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:52,587
There's a.38 snub-nose taped
under the seat of my mother's Cadillac.

799
00:46:52,657 --> 00:46:55,592
You just give him two in the head.
Leave the gun on the floor.

800
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:57,423
- Maybe I will.
- Okay.

801
00:46:58,863 --> 00:47:02,128
- What the...
- Is now a good time?

802
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:04,299
Is everything okay?

803
00:47:04,368 --> 00:47:06,632
- Yeah, it's just the...
- 'Cause you look a little... Oh, geez.

804
00:47:06,704 --> 00:47:08,934
Oh, no, don't... Careful.

805
00:47:09,006 --> 00:47:10,439
Look, right in the ear nearly.

806
00:47:10,508 --> 00:47:13,136
It's just... I saw you talking to
Irish Eddie and I figured, you know...

807
00:47:13,211 --> 00:47:16,112
Hi, there. Hey!

808
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:18,671
Good. Another one.

809
00:47:18,749 --> 00:47:22,207
- Hey, honey.
- Oh, hey! I didn't see you.

810
00:47:22,286 --> 00:47:23,947
- Hi.
- Oh, alive.

811
00:47:24,488 --> 00:47:27,651
Why did this fellow have his hands
in your mouth?

812
00:47:29,126 --> 00:47:31,822
Sorry, Dr. Pincus, this is Richard,
my fiancé.

813
00:47:32,663 --> 00:47:33,891
Richard, this is Dr. Pincus,

814
00:47:33,965 --> 00:47:35,762
that dentist that I told you about
in the building.

815
00:47:35,833 --> 00:47:39,166
I think he's got a really terrific idea
about what might have killed Pepi.

816
00:47:39,237 --> 00:47:40,795
Really? That's fantastic.

817
00:47:40,872 --> 00:47:43,272
You know, I've been needing
to find a dentist, myself.

818
00:47:43,341 --> 00:47:46,970
Why don't you join us for dinner
tomorrow night, Doctor? At Gwen's.

819
00:47:47,044 --> 00:47:48,705
I'm making curry.

820
00:47:49,113 --> 00:47:51,513
- She's really cute.
- Don't...

821
00:47:52,216 --> 00:47:54,184
- Doctor?
- Yes, love to.

822
00:47:54,952 --> 00:47:57,819
- Great.
- I'm in 9F, right below you.

823
00:47:58,789 --> 00:48:00,154
Thank you.

824
00:48:02,693 --> 00:48:05,753
- I hope it was edible.
- Best curry I've ever tasted.

825
00:48:05,830 --> 00:48:08,628
- Stop complimenting him!
- You're too kind.

826
00:48:10,368 --> 00:48:14,327
- Where did you learn to cook?
- Idiot Boy, you're making him look good.

827
00:48:14,405 --> 00:48:18,341
I had a friend
who was generous with her time.

828
00:48:18,409 --> 00:48:20,172
Richard's being modest.

829
00:48:20,244 --> 00:48:23,736
He worked for three years
with homeless prostitutes in Bengal.

830
00:48:23,848 --> 00:48:26,442
You still in the sex trade or...

831
00:48:28,219 --> 00:48:30,312
That's inappropriate.

832
00:48:34,225 --> 00:48:35,487
You know, Doctor,

833
00:48:35,559 --> 00:48:39,290
I confess an ulterior motive
in asking you here tonight.

834
00:48:40,398 --> 00:48:41,490
As a dentist,

835
00:48:41,565 --> 00:48:44,056
you could do an awful lot of good
in the developing world.

836
00:48:44,135 --> 00:48:46,103
They're in desperate need
of modern dental care.

837
00:48:46,170 --> 00:48:48,035
"Modern dental care. "
You believe this guy?

838
00:48:48,105 --> 00:48:51,370
Now, the political will is there,
the money's there.

839
00:48:51,442 --> 00:48:53,433
What an act. So pompous!

840
00:48:54,178 --> 00:48:56,908
- Sorry. What is that?
- My new puppy.

841
00:48:56,981 --> 00:48:59,006
NGOs are being supported.
Record levels.

842
00:48:59,083 --> 00:49:01,381
- I need you to punch him.
- But what we really need...

843
00:49:01,452 --> 00:49:03,079
- Come on!
... are boots on the ground.

844
00:49:03,154 --> 00:49:04,815
Kick his self-righteous teeth in!

845
00:49:04,889 --> 00:49:07,221
How can teeth be self-righteous?

846
00:49:10,661 --> 00:49:16,327
Is a strange thing for a dentist
to burst out with over curry,

847
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:20,200
but, you know, it needs to be...
I mean, I know the answer.

848
00:49:20,271 --> 00:49:22,171
Well, I'll tell you, they can't.

849
00:49:22,239 --> 00:49:25,675
What is essentially dentin and enamel

850
00:49:25,743 --> 00:49:29,975
outcrops from various mandibles
are inanimate,

851
00:49:30,047 --> 00:49:31,605
and therefore, have no moral code.

852
00:49:31,682 --> 00:49:35,914
All they can do is chew and grind,
and that's passive.

853
00:49:35,987 --> 00:49:39,650
It's mainly
the cheek muscles do that, from...

854
00:49:40,524 --> 00:49:42,151
What were you saying?

855
00:49:42,226 --> 00:49:46,754
I was... I was... I was saying, we need...

856
00:49:46,831 --> 00:49:50,995
We need people like you
who can bring their expertise to bear

857
00:49:51,068 --> 00:49:54,731
in places like Peru,
Cambodia, sub-Saharan Africa.

858
00:49:54,805 --> 00:50:00,573
Mainly those sort of really hot,
sticky places.

859
00:50:00,644 --> 00:50:03,875
I mean, I'm just not a humidy person.

860
00:50:03,948 --> 00:50:08,885
I mean, what is the dental care like in,
say, I don't know, Palm Springs?

861
00:50:08,953 --> 00:50:10,215
There's breezes.

862
00:50:10,287 --> 00:50:13,222
You know,
what are the teeth like in Saint-Tropez?

863
00:50:13,290 --> 00:50:16,225
I mean, I could do veneers.
Oh, they love to smile, the French.

864
00:50:16,293 --> 00:50:18,193
Shrugging and smiling.

865
00:50:22,066 --> 00:50:24,000
He's kidding, sweetie.

866
00:50:35,346 --> 00:50:37,644
I'm sorry, I have to take this.

867
00:50:38,749 --> 00:50:41,115
Boy, he'd be handy
on a camping trip, huh?

868
00:50:41,185 --> 00:50:42,652
Do you want some more wine?

869
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:45,314
- That tent pole stuck up his ass.
- Please.

870
00:50:45,423 --> 00:50:46,515
Okay.

871
00:50:50,561 --> 00:50:53,155
Well, that is perfectly unacceptable.

872
00:50:53,664 --> 00:50:55,461
- Shut...
- What?

873
00:50:55,533 --> 00:50:57,194
What?
Am I throwing you off your game?

874
00:50:57,268 --> 00:51:00,635
If I am, just give me a fake cough
and I'll...

875
00:51:02,273 --> 00:51:04,173
Okay, was that...

876
00:51:04,241 --> 00:51:07,335
Was that a coincidence?
Okay, okay! I'm gone.

877
00:51:11,782 --> 00:51:16,651
Richard's a human rights lawyer,
so, well, he takes his job very seriously.

878
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:18,449
Oh, well, so you should
with human rights.

879
00:51:18,522 --> 00:51:20,319
I take human rights seriously.

880
00:51:20,391 --> 00:51:25,158
You know, everybody's equal,
color, creed or circumstance.

881
00:51:26,263 --> 00:51:28,891
We're all the same on this planet.

882
00:51:31,068 --> 00:51:33,502
- Except the Chinese.
- What?

883
00:51:33,571 --> 00:51:36,335
No, they are. They're the odd ones out
if you had to pick one.

884
00:51:36,407 --> 00:51:37,965
No, I'm not having a go.

885
00:51:38,042 --> 00:51:40,203
I'm just saying, you know,
not their faces.

886
00:51:40,277 --> 00:51:42,177
I mean... No, no.
But they call each other

887
00:51:42,246 --> 00:51:43,406
- things like Kwok...
- Stop it. You're gonna...

888
00:51:43,481 --> 00:51:46,041
...and that's their choice,
and they don't have to call a kid Kwok.

889
00:51:46,117 --> 00:51:48,711
And they... No.
Some people are called Pong...

890
00:51:48,786 --> 00:51:51,220
- Stop, please, stop.
... and there's about a million Wangs.

891
00:51:51,288 --> 00:51:52,687
You can have... You have one kid,

892
00:51:52,756 --> 00:51:54,883
you can use all those names
on one little...

893
00:51:54,959 --> 00:51:58,156
You could call a kid Kwok Pong Wang.

894
00:51:58,229 --> 00:52:01,687
Ming Wa Men and Ho Lee Park
have been arrested in Shaolin.

895
00:52:01,765 --> 00:52:04,165
I have to get down to the office.

896
00:52:05,536 --> 00:52:07,367
Well, they're being arraigned
in 30 minutes

897
00:52:07,438 --> 00:52:08,735
- and the government will only allow...
- Not again.

898
00:52:08,806 --> 00:52:11,036
...their attorneys to appear
by closed-circuit.

899
00:52:11,108 --> 00:52:12,234
- I'm sorry.
- I'm afraid I have to go.

900
00:52:12,309 --> 00:52:13,867
Doctor, it's been a...

901
00:52:13,944 --> 00:52:19,041
Yeah, so you guys stay
and have fun and finish up.

902
00:52:24,188 --> 00:52:26,622
Oh, gosh, poor Leonard.
Do you mind if I let him out?

903
00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:29,386
- No, not at all.
- Okay, be right back.

904
00:52:35,666 --> 00:52:37,463
When did you get your horse?

905
00:52:37,535 --> 00:52:38,968
A couple of months ago.

906
00:52:39,036 --> 00:52:41,004
I found him at this shelter
in Long Island.

907
00:52:41,071 --> 00:52:43,369
They were gonna put him down.

908
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,931
Then they lost their nerve, did they?

909
00:52:48,646 --> 00:52:51,137
The smell? Yeah, I know.

910
00:52:51,215 --> 00:52:55,242
His mood levelers give him
this ulcerating skin rash.

911
00:53:04,962 --> 00:53:06,429
Are you okay?

912
00:53:07,965 --> 00:53:10,627
Got a very sensitive gag reflex.

913
00:53:10,701 --> 00:53:13,636
Oh, dear.
And the mixture of that and that.

914
00:53:16,574 --> 00:53:19,771
- Are you all right? Do you want to...
- Sorry.

915
00:53:20,945 --> 00:53:22,674
You know what?
I think he needs to go out.

916
00:53:22,746 --> 00:53:26,045
Do you want to maybe walk him now
or we could finish up and...

917
00:53:26,116 --> 00:53:30,815
Now is good, yeah.
Get some air with some oxygen in it.

918
00:53:49,607 --> 00:53:52,838
Leonard, you good boy!

919
00:53:52,910 --> 00:53:54,969
That is so healthy!

920
00:53:55,045 --> 00:53:58,913
Good, good boy! That's a good boy!

921
00:53:58,983 --> 00:54:01,008
That's a good boy!

922
00:54:02,286 --> 00:54:04,516
You wanna finish dinner?

923
00:54:04,588 --> 00:54:07,182
I don't think I'm quite ready for
solid foods just yet.

924
00:54:07,258 --> 00:54:09,749
- I'll have a drink, though.
- Sure.

925
00:54:11,362 --> 00:54:13,694
There's...
Bemelmans is just around the corner.

926
00:54:13,764 --> 00:54:16,597
Or, no, have you ever been
to that new...

927
00:54:23,707 --> 00:54:25,641
I know, yeah. No, I like Sting

928
00:54:25,709 --> 00:54:27,643
because you can hear
he's educated in his lyrics.

929
00:54:27,711 --> 00:54:30,544
- Pimm's Cup for the lady.
- Thank you.

930
00:54:30,614 --> 00:54:33,674
And a Sapphire martini up with olives.

931
00:54:33,751 --> 00:54:35,343
Thank you.

932
00:54:35,419 --> 00:54:37,216
You know,
that was Frank's favorite drink.

933
00:54:37,288 --> 00:54:39,188
Oh, yeah, I forgot. Sorry.

934
00:54:39,256 --> 00:54:40,587
You forgot?

935
00:54:41,392 --> 00:54:42,984
You forgot what?

936
00:54:44,194 --> 00:54:46,594
Forgot? Yeah.

937
00:54:47,631 --> 00:54:48,791
You recently lost your husband,

938
00:54:48,866 --> 00:54:50,629
and the polite thing to do
in this situation

939
00:54:50,701 --> 00:54:53,169
would have been to check
what the deceased's drink was

940
00:54:53,237 --> 00:54:57,697
as not to evoke any horrible memories.

941
00:54:57,775 --> 00:55:00,608
Why would you assume
that they were horrible?

942
00:55:00,678 --> 00:55:03,374
Painful. Not necessarily horrible.

943
00:55:03,447 --> 00:55:08,077
Just all the memories, nonetheless,
of drink-related death memory.

944
00:55:10,988 --> 00:55:12,319
I like a Pimm's Cup.

945
00:55:12,389 --> 00:55:15,950
This is exactly the kind of girly drink
that Frank would have teased me about.

946
00:55:16,026 --> 00:55:20,520
Once when we were in Anguilla,
I ordered a Screaming Orgasm.

947
00:55:20,597 --> 00:55:23,464
And then...
So Frank goes up to the waiter,

948
00:55:23,534 --> 00:55:25,263
and he grabs him
by the lapels and he goes,

949
00:55:25,336 --> 00:55:27,099
"Hey, I'm the only one giving... "

950
00:55:27,171 --> 00:55:28,604
Oh, for God's sake!

951
00:55:28,672 --> 00:55:30,799
Sorry. Just running
on about my dead husband.

952
00:55:30,874 --> 00:55:34,105
No, no, no, it wasn't you. No, no.
I've just seen someone I hate. It's...

953
00:55:34,178 --> 00:55:36,373
Oh, that's sweet.
They never get over Frankie.

954
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:39,143
- Someone I really hate.
- Well, do you wanna leave?

955
00:55:39,216 --> 00:55:41,343
No, no, no. He should leave.

956
00:55:42,586 --> 00:55:46,249
Let's do some... You were saying that
Frank had his flaws.

957
00:55:46,323 --> 00:55:48,257
- I was?
- Yeah, and that's really healthy

958
00:55:48,325 --> 00:55:50,452
because you should not
romanticize the dead.

959
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:52,688
You should remember their faults.

960
00:55:52,763 --> 00:55:55,789
Oh, well, I remember them.

961
00:55:55,866 --> 00:55:58,426
Oh, good. Well, let's make a list.

962
00:55:59,570 --> 00:56:00,935
What the hell do you think you're doing?

963
00:56:01,004 --> 00:56:04,565
This is therapeutic, actually.
You can trust me. I'm a dentist.

964
00:56:04,641 --> 00:56:06,472
- Come on, then.
- Okay.

965
00:56:07,177 --> 00:56:09,270
His faults. Number one.

966
00:56:09,346 --> 00:56:12,144
Well, Frank could be a little controlling.

967
00:56:12,649 --> 00:56:13,673
Well, that's what made me successful.

968
00:56:13,751 --> 00:56:15,548
But that's probably why
he was so good at his job, so...

969
00:56:15,619 --> 00:56:18,520
No, no, don't apologize for him.
If he was obnoxious, say so.

970
00:56:18,589 --> 00:56:21,285
Okay, he was occasionally obnoxious.

971
00:56:21,358 --> 00:56:22,518
Regularly, I imagine.

972
00:56:22,593 --> 00:56:23,924
- No, no, no, you walked her into that.
- "Obnoxious. "

973
00:56:23,994 --> 00:56:25,757
That didn't count, Pincus.

974
00:56:25,829 --> 00:56:28,525
Hey, what are you doing, Marjorie?
You rubbernecking?

975
00:56:28,599 --> 00:56:32,467
Oh, be quiet! Let them talk.
You could learn something.

976
00:56:33,270 --> 00:56:35,465
He had a shoe fetish.

977
00:56:35,539 --> 00:56:38,599
That is so embarrassing,
because it starts on shoes,

978
00:56:38,675 --> 00:56:42,771
and go to gloves
and hats and socks, up the...

979
00:56:42,846 --> 00:56:44,609
Right. "Pervert. "

980
00:56:44,681 --> 00:56:48,640
And he was rude to waiters.
And I hate that.

981
00:56:48,719 --> 00:56:51,449
- So do I.
- You mind?

982
00:56:51,522 --> 00:56:53,080
Because they're just doing a job,
aren't they?

983
00:56:53,157 --> 00:56:54,454
What a nasty piece of work.

984
00:56:54,525 --> 00:56:56,390
So what about
his physical characteristics?

985
00:56:56,460 --> 00:56:58,428
I'll bet he was really into fitness,

986
00:56:58,495 --> 00:57:00,861
because he was
a scrawny little runt, was he?

987
00:57:00,931 --> 00:57:02,922
No, but, you know,
he was actually starting

988
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,230
to get into yoga at the end there.

989
00:57:05,302 --> 00:57:08,931
- I'll bet he was.
- But he spent a lot of time at the gym.

990
00:57:09,006 --> 00:57:11,065
Yeah. Okay, this is shaping up nicely.

991
00:57:11,141 --> 00:57:15,271
So now we've got
a narcissistic, obnoxious pervert

992
00:57:15,345 --> 00:57:16,812
who's rude to waiters.

993
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:18,245
It's a good list.

994
00:57:18,315 --> 00:57:20,840
I don't have to listen to this shit.

995
00:57:21,552 --> 00:57:22,883
Disloyal.

996
00:57:34,998 --> 00:57:37,364
Yeah, I think that's enough.

997
00:57:43,941 --> 00:57:45,841
I didn't know you knew.

998
00:57:47,644 --> 00:57:52,081
I didn't find out until the day he died.
Can you imagine?

999
00:57:53,951 --> 00:57:56,078
I didn't get the chance to say,
"Hey, go to hell,"

1000
00:57:56,153 --> 00:57:59,418
you know, "I want a divorce,"
like a normal person.

1001
00:58:06,663 --> 00:58:08,688
Well, I'm sorry. I...

1002
00:58:08,765 --> 00:58:11,097
- That must feel...
- Unfinished.

1003
00:58:26,283 --> 00:58:30,014
She used to travel
a lot for her work, Sarah.

1004
00:58:31,321 --> 00:58:35,257
And the trips got longer and longer.

1005
00:58:35,325 --> 00:58:38,852
And then one trip,
she didn't come back at all.

1006
00:58:40,597 --> 00:58:42,622
Married a man in Portland.

1007
00:58:45,269 --> 00:58:46,600
Sorry.

1008
00:58:51,875 --> 00:58:54,639
Travel will do that to a relationship.

1009
00:58:56,547 --> 00:58:57,912
Yep.

1010
00:58:57,981 --> 00:59:01,382
I just got this amazing offer
to go map tombs

1011
00:59:01,451 --> 00:59:04,614
in the Valley of the Kings for six months.

1012
00:59:04,688 --> 00:59:07,384
But I think I'm gonna say no this time.

1013
00:59:09,526 --> 00:59:11,255
Because of Richard.

1014
00:59:12,429 --> 00:59:13,623
Yeah.

1015
00:59:15,499 --> 00:59:17,524
- Good night.
- Good night.

1016
00:59:22,005 --> 00:59:25,805
Your story, it's not boring
and ordinary, by the way.

1017
00:59:26,610 --> 00:59:29,306
I mean, we just get the one life,
you know?

1018
00:59:29,379 --> 00:59:33,816
Just one. You can't live someone else's
or think it's more important,

1019
00:59:33,884 --> 00:59:35,909
just because it's more dramatic.

1020
00:59:35,986 --> 00:59:37,817
What happens matters.

1021
00:59:38,722 --> 00:59:42,021
Maybe only to us, but it matters.

1022
00:59:43,594 --> 00:59:45,084
Good night.

1023
00:59:46,163 --> 00:59:47,528
Good night.

1024
00:59:58,875 --> 01:00:00,069
What?

1025
01:00:00,911 --> 01:00:02,742
What's with the doom and gloom?
It's going good.

1026
01:00:02,813 --> 01:00:04,041
You're weaseling your way
right in there.

1027
01:00:04,114 --> 01:00:05,513
This is gonna work.

1028
01:00:05,582 --> 01:00:09,348
This Richard fellow, I just...
I think Gwen really loves him.

1029
01:00:10,587 --> 01:00:12,145
You know he's a human rights lawyer.

1030
01:00:12,222 --> 01:00:13,587
Hey, when the devil shows up,

1031
01:00:13,657 --> 01:00:16,387
you think he's gonna have
little red horns and carry a pitchfork?

1032
01:00:16,460 --> 01:00:18,394
No, he's gonna work for
Amnesty International,

1033
01:00:18,462 --> 01:00:20,430
and he's gonna give
all of his money to the homeless.

1034
01:00:20,497 --> 01:00:24,160
Well, if he did all that,
wouldn't he lose the title "the devil"?

1035
01:00:24,234 --> 01:00:25,326
You know what I mean.

1036
01:00:25,402 --> 01:00:26,892
Pincus, I got better things
to do with my time.

1037
01:00:26,970 --> 01:00:28,562
I wouldn't just be hanging out here.

1038
01:00:28,639 --> 01:00:30,869
What, exactly,
is your problem with Richard?

1039
01:00:30,941 --> 01:00:32,272
I told you!

1040
01:00:32,342 --> 01:00:34,401
The guy is setting her up
to rob her blind.

1041
01:00:34,478 --> 01:00:36,105
And what proof have you got? I don't...

1042
01:00:36,179 --> 01:00:37,612
What are you basing this on?

1043
01:00:37,681 --> 01:00:41,242
I saw things with my own two eyes.

1044
01:00:41,318 --> 01:00:43,809
- Saw what?
- Just enough to know.

1045
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:45,911
Come on. What did he do?

1046
01:00:46,556 --> 01:00:49,650
Well, that's... He's...

1047
01:00:49,726 --> 01:00:52,126
Okay, all right, fine.
They're out at a restaurant, okay?

1048
01:00:52,195 --> 01:00:53,526
- Yeah.
- And they're eating.

1049
01:00:53,597 --> 01:00:54,894
- Yeah.
- And the check came,

1050
01:00:54,965 --> 01:00:58,833
and this clown says
that his wallet is in his coat.

1051
01:00:58,902 --> 01:01:00,870
It's over at the coat check.

1052
01:01:00,937 --> 01:01:02,336
- How convenient, right?
- Right.

1053
01:01:02,406 --> 01:01:03,930
So he goes over to go get it,

1054
01:01:04,007 --> 01:01:06,407
makes a big show
about the whole thing, too,

1055
01:01:06,476 --> 01:01:10,344
and she says, "No, no, let me get this. "

1056
01:01:13,850 --> 01:01:15,750
- Yeah?
- And he accepted.

1057
01:01:17,954 --> 01:01:20,149
There's nothing
wrong with him, is there?

1058
01:01:20,223 --> 01:01:22,714
No, no, don't you see?
He showed his true colors.

1059
01:01:22,793 --> 01:01:23,987
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1060
01:01:24,061 --> 01:01:25,995
Listen, he's a perfectly
lovely human being.

1061
01:01:26,063 --> 01:01:27,894
Pincus, there are other things!

1062
01:01:27,964 --> 01:01:30,330
- He took five grand from her.
- He what?

1063
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:32,425
Yeah. $5,000.

1064
01:01:32,502 --> 01:01:34,299
I saw her write the check
with my own two eyes,

1065
01:01:34,371 --> 01:01:37,568
put it right in his sweaty little fist.
It was...

1066
01:01:38,408 --> 01:01:40,342
For charity.
He was fundraising, wasn't he?

1067
01:01:40,410 --> 01:01:42,071
Or shaking the money tree,
see what drops.

1068
01:01:42,145 --> 01:01:43,237
- I don't know.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1069
01:01:43,313 --> 01:01:44,610
- What was it, AIDS?
- No.

1070
01:01:44,681 --> 01:01:46,114
Refugees?

1071
01:01:46,183 --> 01:01:48,981
Orphans? Orphans. Good.

1072
01:01:49,052 --> 01:01:50,383
- You're missing the point.
- Yeah.

1073
01:01:50,454 --> 01:01:53,719
- You really are. This guy, he's a lawyer.
- Yeah.

1074
01:01:53,790 --> 01:01:57,590
A lawyer who fights to protect the rights
of the underprivileged. Come on!

1075
01:01:57,661 --> 01:01:59,595
There must be
something wrong with him.

1076
01:01:59,663 --> 01:02:02,188
There must be some reason
why all this is happening.

1077
01:02:02,265 --> 01:02:05,496
Otherwise, what am I doing here?

1078
01:02:07,370 --> 01:02:08,860
I'm out.

1079
01:02:08,939 --> 01:02:11,806
What? No, no. What do you mean?

1080
01:02:12,976 --> 01:02:15,604
I mean, I'm not gonna interfere
with Gwen's life anymore.

1081
01:02:15,679 --> 01:02:17,169
And I can't lie to her.

1082
01:02:17,247 --> 01:02:18,976
You were right about the pirate look.
She threw that at me,

1083
01:02:19,049 --> 01:02:20,539
and I nearly confessed
to everything there and then.

1084
01:02:20,617 --> 01:02:22,642
You can't abandon her to this creep.

1085
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:24,584
- She loves him.
- She doesn't love him!

1086
01:02:24,654 --> 01:02:26,849
I haven't seen her laugh
once with this guy!

1087
01:02:26,923 --> 01:02:28,652
He's a good man.

1088
01:02:28,725 --> 01:02:32,161
You actually like him,
with his whole Mother Teresa schtick?

1089
01:02:32,229 --> 01:02:33,696
I hate him. Okay?

1090
01:02:33,764 --> 01:02:37,962
I want to run him over
with his own little stupid, electric car.

1091
01:02:38,068 --> 01:02:39,092
But he's what Gwen wants.

1092
01:02:39,169 --> 01:02:41,729
And after what
she's been through with you,

1093
01:02:41,805 --> 01:02:44,433
she deserves a bit of happiness.

1094
01:02:44,508 --> 01:02:46,476
You're in love with her.

1095
01:02:49,312 --> 01:02:51,940
You are. I knew it.

1096
01:02:55,886 --> 01:02:58,116
That little Grinch heart of yours
actually started beating,

1097
01:02:58,188 --> 01:03:01,123
and now you want to take it back
to your cave and crush it with a rock.

1098
01:03:01,191 --> 01:03:03,182
That's what you wanna do.

1099
01:03:03,994 --> 01:03:06,292
- I quit.
- You can't quit.

1100
01:03:06,363 --> 01:03:08,797
I'll make your life a living hell.

1101
01:03:11,001 --> 01:03:12,491
It already is.

1102
01:03:37,294 --> 01:03:41,253
There you go. That's such a good boy.
Such a good boy.

1103
01:03:41,331 --> 01:03:44,664
Leonard, Leonard, open, open.

1104
01:03:44,734 --> 01:03:47,601
Come on. Come on, sweetie. Come on.

1105
01:03:47,671 --> 01:03:51,072
Leonard, Leonard, Leonard.
Don't be a jerk. Come on.

1106
01:03:51,141 --> 01:03:55,373
God damn it. Come on. Come on.

1107
01:03:55,445 --> 01:03:59,176
You don't wanna wait until
it's too late, do you, sweetie?

1108
01:04:02,018 --> 01:04:03,144
Wait.

1109
01:04:04,688 --> 01:04:08,249
Leonard! It is too late.

1110
01:04:14,431 --> 01:04:15,864
Too late.

1111
01:04:21,204 --> 01:04:22,831
And so Alex says to me,

1112
01:04:22,906 --> 01:04:26,307
"Mommy, I know that babies come
from inside a lady's tummy,

1113
01:04:26,376 --> 01:04:30,073
"but what I really want to know is,
how do they get there?"

1114
01:04:30,814 --> 01:04:32,543
Can you believe? And, of course,

1115
01:04:32,616 --> 01:04:33,878
- I have no clue what to say...
- Head back.

1116
01:04:33,950 --> 01:04:35,781
...but I have to come up with something,
because his father...

1117
01:04:35,852 --> 01:04:39,811
Oh, no talking,
not when we're popping this in.

1118
01:04:39,890 --> 01:04:41,221
- Okay.
- Bite down there.

1119
01:04:41,291 --> 01:04:43,759
There you go. Good.

1120
01:04:43,827 --> 01:04:45,727
Just leave that there.

1121
01:04:46,496 --> 01:04:49,659
Isn't that good? So much better.

1122
01:04:49,733 --> 01:04:55,467
You're resting your jaw, and I'm resting
my ears and we're all winners.

1123
01:04:58,008 --> 01:04:59,805
Can you get these over to the lab?
A little rush job.

1124
01:04:59,876 --> 01:05:01,810
Mr. Harriman's bridge
is on the verge of...

1125
01:05:01,878 --> 01:05:04,472
I thought I was through
for the day after this.

1126
01:05:04,547 --> 01:05:07,277
- You are through.
- What about the...

1127
01:05:10,487 --> 01:05:12,114
What about what?

1128
01:05:12,656 --> 01:05:14,351
- Frank.
- Who?

1129
01:05:15,258 --> 01:05:16,987
I don't know who you mean.

1130
01:05:17,060 --> 01:05:18,857
What are you... Who? I've never...

1131
01:05:18,929 --> 01:05:22,160
Okay, my opinion is that
you didn't make sense just now.

1132
01:05:22,232 --> 01:05:23,756
Well, I don't know
who you're talking about.

1133
01:05:23,833 --> 01:05:27,030
Can I have the bathroom key, please?
I'm having a bit of a...

1134
01:05:27,103 --> 01:05:28,730
- No, no, he'll run.
- That's him!

1135
01:05:28,805 --> 01:05:31,501
- Dentist, don't piss me off!
- Thank you.

1136
01:05:43,820 --> 01:05:45,378
He's not in the office!

1137
01:05:50,794 --> 01:05:53,092
Well, then he must be upstairs.

1138
01:05:58,468 --> 01:06:00,561
Good afternoon, Doctor.

1139
01:06:00,637 --> 01:06:02,969
Good to see you. You look smart.

1140
01:06:10,180 --> 01:06:12,171
Just been to the toilet.

1141
01:06:13,917 --> 01:06:16,010
Different route back, around the...

1142
01:06:16,086 --> 01:06:19,317
I mean, I finished earlier than I thought,
so I just took my time.

1143
01:06:19,389 --> 01:06:22,085
I mean, you can take a long time
next time if you...

1144
01:06:25,061 --> 01:06:26,460
Good. Okay.

1145
01:06:27,931 --> 01:06:29,296
That's set.

1146
01:06:30,567 --> 01:06:32,398
Okay, it has to be...

1147
01:06:33,837 --> 01:06:35,134
Good.

1148
01:06:35,205 --> 01:06:37,901
Can you take a new walk-in
before you leave, Dr. Pincus?

1149
01:06:37,974 --> 01:06:40,408
He seems to be in a lot of pain.

1150
01:06:40,477 --> 01:06:42,342
Life is pain.

1151
01:06:44,114 --> 01:06:46,149
Does that mean yes?

1152
01:06:47,717 --> 01:06:50,914
So we have an emergency
on our hands. I'm Dr. Pincus.

1153
01:06:50,987 --> 01:06:53,421
- Yes, we've met.
- Oh, hi.

1154
01:06:54,257 --> 01:06:56,418
- Thanks for seeing me.
- Yep.

1155
01:06:56,493 --> 01:06:57,926
What seems to be the problem?

1156
01:06:57,994 --> 01:07:01,122
I don't know.
I think I must have cracked a filling.

1157
01:07:01,197 --> 01:07:02,721
That was silly.

1158
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:05,629
Head back.

1159
01:07:05,702 --> 01:07:08,466
Let's have a look, shall we? Open up.

1160
01:07:10,073 --> 01:07:11,700
Oh, yeah, there it is.

1161
01:07:11,775 --> 01:07:13,766
Well, you've got the bite of an Inuit.

1162
01:07:13,843 --> 01:07:15,003
Have you been chewing seal hide?

1163
01:07:15,078 --> 01:07:16,943
Yeah, well,
I tend to grind my teeth pretty hard

1164
01:07:17,013 --> 01:07:19,413
when I'm stressed and I'm...

1165
01:07:19,482 --> 01:07:21,575
I don't know.
Last night was a tough one.

1166
01:07:21,651 --> 01:07:24,085
- I came home and Gwen was...
- What?

1167
01:07:25,255 --> 01:07:27,314
- Gwen was...
- Oh, no, never mind.

1168
01:07:27,390 --> 01:07:29,381
No, you were gonna
say something about...

1169
01:07:29,459 --> 01:07:31,427
Well, she was just...

1170
01:07:33,363 --> 01:07:35,695
- No, forget about it.
- No, I can't forget about it.

1171
01:07:35,765 --> 01:07:37,027
- Just...
- Well, it's nothing.

1172
01:07:37,100 --> 01:07:38,192
- Can we just get this...
- Well, it is something

1173
01:07:38,268 --> 01:07:40,293
or you wouldn't have brought it up.
And, you know...

1174
01:07:40,370 --> 01:07:41,803
- It's personal.
- I know that,

1175
01:07:41,871 --> 01:07:43,463
but, I mean just to...

1176
01:07:43,540 --> 01:07:44,666
I'd rather not talk about it.

1177
01:07:44,741 --> 01:07:47,232
- Why don't we just...
- "Finish what you started" is my motto.

1178
01:07:47,310 --> 01:07:50,473
- I'm a good listener. Please.
- I'd rather not talk about it.

1179
01:07:50,547 --> 01:07:52,014
- Can we just...
- Well, can you wait a minute then?

1180
01:07:52,082 --> 01:07:53,913
- I'm in pain.
- Please.

1181
01:07:58,288 --> 01:07:59,880
Dr. Prashar?

1182
01:08:04,694 --> 01:08:07,663
Jahangir? That's his first name.

1183
01:08:10,767 --> 01:08:13,565
You're from a scary country, aren't you?

1184
01:08:14,737 --> 01:08:16,136
Excuse me.

1185
01:08:16,773 --> 01:08:18,638
- I'm from India.
- Yeah.

1186
01:08:18,708 --> 01:08:21,199
So you're not a Christian, like us.

1187
01:08:22,946 --> 01:08:24,641
No, I'm a Hindu.

1188
01:08:27,984 --> 01:08:31,147
How would you extract information
from a hostile?

1189
01:08:34,624 --> 01:08:37,821
Well, as a Hindu person,

1190
01:08:37,894 --> 01:08:41,694
I would ask them politely.

1191
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:47,766
Yeah, I just need a technique.

1192
01:08:47,837 --> 01:08:51,329
- Doctor, I'm with a patient.
- Yeah. Okay.

1193
01:08:56,012 --> 01:08:57,172
So where were we?

1194
01:08:57,247 --> 01:08:58,942
You were telling me about Gwen.
Something...

1195
01:08:59,015 --> 01:09:02,109
- No, I wasn't. I meant my tooth, yeah.
- Tooth.

1196
01:09:02,218 --> 01:09:05,483
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Let's do this professionally.

1197
01:09:05,555 --> 01:09:11,255
All work and no play makes Jack
a valuable member of society.

1198
01:09:12,495 --> 01:09:13,860
Open up.

1199
01:09:16,166 --> 01:09:19,602
- That hurts.
- Did it? Well, take your word for that.

1200
01:09:19,669 --> 01:09:22,763
But it almost certainly would
in this situation.

1201
01:09:23,773 --> 01:09:27,504
Do you know the worst thing
in the world for teeth?

1202
01:09:28,211 --> 01:09:29,974
- Sugar?
- Secrets.

1203
01:09:31,047 --> 01:09:32,878
If you tell me what's on your mind,
you will feel better.

1204
01:09:32,949 --> 01:09:35,850
As I said before, Doctor, it's private.

1205
01:09:35,919 --> 01:09:38,854
I really would like to keep this
on a professional footing.

1206
01:09:38,922 --> 01:09:40,355
Yes, please.

1207
01:09:41,758 --> 01:09:44,750
We can play it any way you want to.

1208
01:09:48,565 --> 01:09:50,192
Actually.

1209
01:09:57,707 --> 01:09:59,675
That's not Novocain.

1210
01:09:59,742 --> 01:10:03,678
No, it is a little dab of nitrous oxide.

1211
01:10:03,746 --> 01:10:07,341
Nitrous? I didn't know you guys
still used nitrous.

1212
01:10:07,417 --> 01:10:09,544
- Are there any side effects?
- A few.

1213
01:10:09,619 --> 01:10:12,452
Some people laugh.
Some people get sleepy.

1214
01:10:13,356 --> 01:10:14,983
But they all talk.

1215
01:10:22,165 --> 01:10:25,532
Hey, Frankie! Fancy seeing you here.

1216
01:10:25,602 --> 01:10:29,299
You back on the job yet
or you need me to send more?

1217
01:10:29,372 --> 01:10:31,966
I got a couple Civil War
re-enactors that'll talk your ear off.

1218
01:10:32,041 --> 01:10:34,202
- They used live ammo.
- Didn't get the news.

1219
01:10:34,277 --> 01:10:36,541
Job's done. Richard's history.

1220
01:10:36,613 --> 01:10:39,241
- What?
- She dumped him last night.

1221
01:10:39,315 --> 01:10:42,375
- How do you know?
- He told me. The marriage is off.

1222
01:10:42,452 --> 01:10:43,976
So he's out completely?

1223
01:10:44,053 --> 01:10:46,647
Well, he wants to stay friends,
but she's done with him.

1224
01:10:46,723 --> 01:10:48,247
She said she was confused
about her feelings

1225
01:10:48,324 --> 01:10:51,225
and it wasn't right
to string him along, so...

1226
01:10:52,061 --> 01:10:53,528
Why would Richard tell you all this?

1227
01:10:53,596 --> 01:10:56,497
Because I gave him
700 milliliters of nitrous oxide.

1228
01:10:56,566 --> 01:10:59,831
- Is that a lot?
- No. It's not fatal till 750.

1229
01:10:59,902 --> 01:11:02,393
You know, I think this sounds
a lot like a premarital spat.

1230
01:11:02,472 --> 01:11:04,463
- I mean, young couples at this stage...
- No. Definitely not.

1231
01:11:04,540 --> 01:11:05,768
- Very normal for them to start...
- No, no, no.

1232
01:11:05,842 --> 01:11:08,538
...to get into this...
- She's taken the job in Egypt.

1233
01:11:08,611 --> 01:11:10,442
She's going there for six months.

1234
01:11:10,513 --> 01:11:15,075
It's the real thing. She leaves Thursday,
right after the exhibition opens.

1235
01:11:16,586 --> 01:11:18,850
- Well, this is great news.
- Yeah.

1236
01:11:18,921 --> 01:11:22,618
Yeah, we should maybe go celebrate,
I guess.

1237
01:11:22,692 --> 01:11:25,217
- I can't.
- Me, neither.

1238
01:11:25,295 --> 01:11:27,422
- Well, wait! What's in the bag?
- Nothing.

1239
01:11:27,497 --> 01:11:28,691
Is that from a jewelry store?

1240
01:11:28,765 --> 01:11:31,325
- Oh, my gosh. Is that for Gwen?
- It doesn't matter.

1241
01:11:31,401 --> 01:11:33,961
Well, whatever happened
to the "I will not interfere" thing?

1242
01:11:34,037 --> 01:11:35,937
There's nothing to interfere with now,
is there?

1243
01:11:36,005 --> 01:11:38,530
The relationship's over!
She doesn't love him.

1244
01:11:38,608 --> 01:11:39,802
And you think she's gonna love you?

1245
01:11:39,876 --> 01:11:42,606
A smock-wearing tooth jockey?
I mean, I'm sorry.

1246
01:11:42,679 --> 01:11:45,341
You said that if I broke up the marriage,
you'd leave me alone!

1247
01:11:45,415 --> 01:11:46,814
I broke up the marriage!
Leave me alone!

1248
01:11:46,883 --> 01:11:48,783
Well, you should at least let me
help you pick out something!

1249
01:11:48,851 --> 01:11:51,183
Do you have any idea how much
"Please forgive me" jewelry

1250
01:11:51,254 --> 01:11:52,721
- I bought her over the years?
- I can take it from here!

1251
01:11:52,789 --> 01:11:54,120
She loves Peruvian gold, but, Pincus,

1252
01:11:54,190 --> 01:11:56,283
- you're rushing things, I'm telling you!
- Frank! Listen!

1253
01:11:56,359 --> 01:11:59,328
Our time together, as we both know,
has been rather unpleasant.

1254
01:11:59,395 --> 01:12:02,057
But I will say this.
Even though you're a vulgar man,

1255
01:12:02,131 --> 01:12:06,500
boorish, distasteful, uncouth,
uneducated, stupid, at least...

1256
01:12:10,907 --> 01:12:13,137
- You gonna finish?
- Done.

1257
01:12:14,477 --> 01:12:17,037
- Okay.
- The point is this,

1258
01:12:17,113 --> 01:12:19,843
we finished what you had to finish.
And who knows?

1259
01:12:19,916 --> 01:12:22,646
One day, not too soon I hope,
we meet up again.

1260
01:12:22,719 --> 01:12:26,211
- Until then, this is our fond farewell.
- Yeah, but...

1261
01:12:29,525 --> 01:12:31,493
But why am I still here?

1262
01:12:36,833 --> 01:12:39,131
Construction crane dropped
two tons of steel on us.

1263
01:12:39,202 --> 01:12:40,328
That must have hurt.

1264
01:12:40,403 --> 01:12:42,735
It was a hydraulic leak. An act of God!

1265
01:12:42,805 --> 01:12:44,568
Why does he do those things?

1266
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:46,835
But the crane operator,
he thinks it's all his fault.

1267
01:12:46,909 --> 01:12:48,536
Oh, therapy time!

1268
01:12:58,154 --> 01:13:00,179
Don't panic. It's nothing.

1269
01:13:04,861 --> 01:13:06,260
A key chain.

1270
01:13:07,130 --> 01:13:08,961
I needed a key chain!

1271
01:13:09,565 --> 01:13:11,590
- I love it!
- Oh, good.

1272
01:13:12,869 --> 01:13:16,361
I can't believe you remembered.
That is just...

1273
01:13:16,439 --> 01:13:19,431
What a strange
and practical man you are.

1274
01:13:19,509 --> 01:13:22,706
It was down to that
or a set of socket wrenches.

1275
01:13:23,513 --> 01:13:25,140
Well, I hope you didn't spend too much.

1276
01:13:25,214 --> 01:13:27,307
$140. The receipt's in the box.

1277
01:13:27,383 --> 01:13:30,352
No, well, you don't actually
have to tell people in that situation.

1278
01:13:30,420 --> 01:13:32,911
No, no, no.
I'm just saying it was no big deal.

1279
01:13:32,989 --> 01:13:35,219
It's not like
it's Peruvian gold or anything.

1280
01:13:35,291 --> 01:13:38,852
And the reason I say that
is because there was a set of earrings

1281
01:13:38,928 --> 01:13:40,987
made from Peruvian gold in the shop,

1282
01:13:41,063 --> 01:13:42,530
and I thought, "Gwen would like those,

1283
01:13:42,598 --> 01:13:44,429
"but sorry,
a little bit out of my price range. "

1284
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:45,626
So...

1285
01:13:46,736 --> 01:13:49,204
What? Stop giving me the pirate look.

1286
01:13:49,272 --> 01:13:54,608
I just got you a gift and, you know,
nothing ostentatious or pushy.

1287
01:13:54,677 --> 01:13:57,077
Just a little gesture to let you know
I've been thinking about you,

1288
01:13:57,146 --> 01:13:58,943
and I think you should accept it

1289
01:13:59,015 --> 01:14:02,974
in the spirit of friendship
with which it was given.

1290
01:14:03,052 --> 01:14:06,385
"Pirate look"? How could you
possibly know about that?

1291
01:14:06,456 --> 01:14:08,287
- I don't.
- You do.

1292
01:14:09,025 --> 01:14:11,391
- Common expression?
- No.

1293
01:14:11,461 --> 01:14:13,224
How do you know
about any of this stuff?

1294
01:14:13,296 --> 01:14:16,288
- Pirate look? Peruvian gold?
- Everyone knows about Peruvian gold.

1295
01:14:16,365 --> 01:14:18,629
And then the other night,
Frank's favorite drink?

1296
01:14:19,168 --> 01:14:21,227
Come on, take it easy.

1297
01:14:21,604 --> 01:14:23,799
- Don't tell me to take it easy.
- You hate that.

1298
01:14:23,873 --> 01:14:25,636
How do you know what I hate?

1299
01:14:25,708 --> 01:14:27,733
Lucky guess. Can we start again?

1300
01:14:27,810 --> 01:14:30,870
Why don't you just tell her?
Come on, spill it.

1301
01:14:31,347 --> 01:14:33,076
She's leaving anyway in a few days.

1302
01:14:33,149 --> 01:14:35,276
Gonna have to go with the truth,
Dentist, no choice.

1303
01:14:35,351 --> 01:14:37,683
You've got about 10 seconds
to start talking, buddy,

1304
01:14:37,753 --> 01:14:39,118
and then I'm out of here.

1305
01:14:39,188 --> 01:14:41,952
How do you know
this stuff from my life with Frank?

1306
01:14:42,024 --> 01:14:43,582
- It'll sound crazy.
- Try her.

1307
01:14:43,659 --> 01:14:44,853
Try me.

1308
01:14:46,329 --> 01:14:49,025
A couple of weeks ago, I went into
hospital for a routine operation,

1309
01:14:49,098 --> 01:14:53,558
but there was complications.
And I died. Just for a few minutes...

1310
01:14:56,239 --> 01:14:58,799
It's true! I can prove it!
He's here, right now, with us.

1311
01:14:58,875 --> 01:15:01,844
You know what? Just stop.
What you're doing, it's cruel.

1312
01:15:01,911 --> 01:15:03,242
How else would I know
all the things I know?

1313
01:15:03,312 --> 01:15:05,473
Well, you must have known Frank.

1314
01:15:05,548 --> 01:15:07,448
I don't know,
maybe you were his dentist.

1315
01:15:07,517 --> 01:15:10,213
Ask me something else, then.
Something that I couldn't possibly know.

1316
01:15:10,286 --> 01:15:12,550
- How do you get like you?
- Please.

1317
01:15:12,622 --> 01:15:16,524
One question, and if I get it wrong,
you'll never see me again.

1318
01:15:18,594 --> 01:15:22,086
Frank used to have this nightmare
over and over.

1319
01:15:22,164 --> 01:15:25,622
He'd wake up in tears and he never told
anybody else about it, but me.

1320
01:15:25,701 --> 01:15:27,100
What was it?

1321
01:15:27,904 --> 01:15:29,201
Drowning.

1322
01:15:30,072 --> 01:15:33,439
I'd dream that I dove into the water,
and I went down deep,

1323
01:15:33,509 --> 01:15:36,103
but when I turned around
to make it back to the top,

1324
01:15:36,178 --> 01:15:37,736
I couldn't, no matter how hard I swam.

1325
01:15:37,813 --> 01:15:39,405
Drowning. He dived into the water,

1326
01:15:39,482 --> 01:15:44,215
and it didn't matter how hard he tried
to get back to the surface, he couldn't.

1327
01:15:45,454 --> 01:15:47,354
That's right, isn't it?

1328
01:15:47,857 --> 01:15:49,449
Not even close.

1329
01:15:52,128 --> 01:15:53,152
No!

1330
01:15:54,196 --> 01:15:56,562
You know the first time I met you?

1331
01:15:56,632 --> 01:16:01,968
And then the next 10 or 12 times
after that, I thought, "What a jerk. "

1332
01:16:02,505 --> 01:16:04,735
But then I got to know you
a little bit, right?

1333
01:16:04,807 --> 01:16:07,708
And I convinced myself
that I saw something human in you.

1334
01:16:07,777 --> 01:16:09,745
You know,
"Maybe he's just a little eccentric,

1335
01:16:09,812 --> 01:16:12,076
"needs a little work. "

1336
01:16:12,148 --> 01:16:15,481
But to use intimate details
about my dead husband

1337
01:16:15,551 --> 01:16:19,180
in order to get close to me,
or for God knows what other reason,

1338
01:16:19,255 --> 01:16:21,223
that's unforgivable.

1339
01:16:22,191 --> 01:16:23,624
You're sick.

1340
01:16:26,395 --> 01:16:28,863
- I love you.
- Don't call me!

1341
01:16:35,404 --> 01:16:37,736
You lied. Why would you do that?

1342
01:16:42,178 --> 01:16:44,578
Because you're
a heartless son of a bitch

1343
01:16:44,647 --> 01:16:48,083
who doesn't give a rat's ass
about anyone but himself.

1344
01:16:51,454 --> 01:16:53,752
She's already had one of those.

1345
01:16:55,324 --> 01:16:57,292
See you around, Dentist.

1346
01:17:38,934 --> 01:17:40,902
- What?
- It's my daughter.

1347
01:17:40,970 --> 01:17:42,528
Yeah, you mentioned
something about that.

1348
01:17:42,605 --> 01:17:45,165
She won't speak to her sister,
her only sister.

1349
01:17:45,241 --> 01:17:47,971
She's so angry about the necklace I left,

1350
01:17:48,044 --> 01:17:51,241
but I slipped a letter under her door
the day before I died.

1351
01:17:51,313 --> 01:17:53,577
It explained everything.

1352
01:17:53,649 --> 01:17:56,413
But there was carpeting in the entryway.

1353
01:17:56,485 --> 01:17:59,977
I didn't know
the letter went under the carpet.

1354
01:18:00,056 --> 01:18:01,284
She never got it.

1355
01:18:01,357 --> 01:18:03,791
My God, you're boring, aren't you?

1356
01:18:06,462 --> 01:18:09,431
My little boy has a stuffed animal,
a squirrel.

1357
01:18:09,498 --> 01:18:11,261
It was his favorite.
He took it everywhere.

1358
01:18:11,333 --> 01:18:15,235
Couldn't get to sleep without it.
But he lost it on the day I died.

1359
01:18:15,304 --> 01:18:17,067
They don't know it's just
under the front seat of the car.

1360
01:18:17,139 --> 01:18:19,004
It's right there, they just can't see it.

1361
01:18:19,075 --> 01:18:21,942
So now, he cries himself to sleep
without it every night,

1362
01:18:22,011 --> 01:18:24,479
because to him that toy is me.

1363
01:18:25,147 --> 01:18:26,842
I can't help you.

1364
01:18:27,750 --> 01:18:30,082
You mean you won't help us.

1365
01:18:30,152 --> 01:18:31,949
Isn't that the truth?

1366
01:18:32,021 --> 01:18:35,149
Yeah, I'll tell you
what else is true, shall I?

1367
01:18:36,392 --> 01:18:39,293
We live alone and then we die alone.

1368
01:18:39,862 --> 01:18:42,797
And, apparently, we stay alone.

1369
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:46,634
That's the truth, too, isn't it?

1370
01:19:48,597 --> 01:19:50,758
- You idiot!
- I'm sorry!

1371
01:20:02,344 --> 01:20:04,403
<b>Unbelievable! Come on.</b>

1372
01:21:04,707 --> 01:21:06,698
- Hello.
- What a day.

1373
01:21:07,843 --> 01:21:11,176
Yeah, well, it appears that
winter is upon us.

1374
01:21:11,247 --> 01:21:13,078
- Hail.
- What?

1375
01:21:13,148 --> 01:21:15,946
It doesn't even have
the decency to snow.

1376
01:21:17,019 --> 01:21:20,580
Is there any more stupid form
of precipitation than hail?

1377
01:21:22,258 --> 01:21:26,592
- No, I suppose that is the stupidest.
- Jahangir?

1378
01:21:26,662 --> 01:21:28,562
- Yeah.
- We're friends.

1379
01:21:28,631 --> 01:21:29,723
- Well...
- Associates.

1380
01:21:29,798 --> 01:21:32,232
- Yeah.
- We have things in common.

1381
01:21:32,301 --> 01:21:34,394
- Yeah.
- We share stuff and...

1382
01:21:34,470 --> 01:21:36,700
Panoramic X-ray machine, for example.

1383
01:21:36,772 --> 01:21:37,796
- Yeah.
- We're close.

1384
01:21:37,873 --> 01:21:40,706
- No, I wouldn't say that.
- Not close, but... What the...

1385
01:21:40,776 --> 01:21:43,336
Well, that's not the point, is it?

1386
01:21:44,580 --> 01:21:45,911
Listen.

1387
01:21:46,982 --> 01:21:48,540
I met a woman.

1388
01:21:50,052 --> 01:21:52,043
The kind of a woman that

1389
01:21:52,121 --> 01:21:55,215
makes you want to go back in time
to before you met her.

1390
01:21:55,291 --> 01:22:00,126
Whatever the hell life was like then,
it's not as bad as the hell now.

1391
01:22:01,931 --> 01:22:04,991
Knowing she's out there
and you can't have her.

1392
01:22:06,201 --> 01:22:08,669
What I'm trying to say is

1393
01:22:10,039 --> 01:22:13,099
could you write me
a prescription for Percocet?

1394
01:22:14,310 --> 01:22:15,800
What?

1395
01:22:15,878 --> 01:22:17,368
Well, I can't prescribe myself, can I?

1396
01:22:17,446 --> 01:22:21,906
Legally. It's for my sleep
and to pretend she never happened.

1397
01:22:22,685 --> 01:22:24,152
Or Darvon.

1398
01:22:24,219 --> 01:22:25,652
Or Vicodin.

1399
01:22:25,721 --> 01:22:28,849
Just like a 30 count, or 60,
if you don't want

1400
01:22:29,892 --> 01:22:33,020
me to keep bothering you.
And I'll be out of your hair.

1401
01:22:33,095 --> 01:22:35,825
I'm not even gonna ask for morphine.

1402
01:22:39,635 --> 01:22:41,102
Come with me.

1403
01:22:46,108 --> 01:22:47,200
- What are we doing?
- Just sit down.

1404
01:22:47,276 --> 01:22:48,504
- No.
- Sit down.

1405
01:22:48,577 --> 01:22:50,374
- Why?
- Just sit down.

1406
01:22:57,119 --> 01:23:00,452
- Oh, look, never mind.
- This is important. Look.

1407
01:23:05,427 --> 01:23:07,554
- Brilliant.
- The other one.

1408
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:15,102
Yep. As mass-produced poster
slogans go, that's good.

1409
01:23:15,170 --> 01:23:18,333
Dr. Pincus, at some point in your life,
you're gonna have to stop,

1410
01:23:18,407 --> 01:23:21,103
and ask yourself the ultimate question.

1411
01:23:22,211 --> 01:23:23,803
"This business of

1412
01:23:24,947 --> 01:23:28,178
"being such a fucking prick,

1413
01:23:29,585 --> 01:23:31,780
"what is it really getting me?"

1414
01:24:05,554 --> 01:24:07,988
You said something about a letter.

1415
01:25:21,663 --> 01:25:23,460
You should try it on.

1416
01:25:40,749 --> 01:25:43,309
Mom! Look what I found!

1417
01:25:43,385 --> 01:25:46,616
What? Where'd you find this?
Where did it come from?

1418
01:25:46,688 --> 01:25:48,815
It fell out of his backpack.

1419
01:25:49,658 --> 01:25:51,057
Thank you.

1420
01:25:53,829 --> 01:25:55,194
Dr. Pincus?

1421
01:26:00,135 --> 01:26:02,433
Hi. Sorry, I didn't...

1422
01:26:06,241 --> 01:26:08,436
Thank you. Thank you so much!

1423
01:26:09,111 --> 01:26:10,806
I never realized.

1424
01:27:38,066 --> 01:27:39,260
Thanks.

1425
01:27:42,137 --> 01:27:45,106
...many insights into the life
and death of King Pepi.

1426
01:27:45,173 --> 01:27:47,437
Thank you. Thank you very much.

1427
01:27:52,014 --> 01:27:54,574
Thank you very much. Thank you.

1428
01:27:54,650 --> 01:27:55,742
Gwen!

1429
01:27:58,587 --> 01:28:00,179
What are you doing here?

1430
01:28:00,255 --> 01:28:02,189
I've got to talk to
you. I've figured it out.

1431
01:28:02,257 --> 01:28:03,815
Please leave me alone.

1432
01:28:03,892 --> 01:28:05,792
It's all rubbish.
What they tell us in ghost stories,

1433
01:28:05,861 --> 01:28:07,488
I think they've got it completely wrong.

1434
01:28:07,562 --> 01:28:11,328
Ghost stories.
Could you not do this here tonight?

1435
01:28:11,400 --> 01:28:15,234
Look at Pepi. Okay, they buried him with
everything a dead guy doesn't need.

1436
01:28:15,304 --> 01:28:17,602
Household pets, money.

1437
01:28:17,673 --> 01:28:21,302
They even put his penis in a big jar.
Why would they do that?

1438
01:28:21,376 --> 01:28:25,176
But you saw that penis.
It wouldn't have fit in a little jar.

1439
01:28:26,114 --> 01:28:28,674
No, not why did they put it in a big...

1440
01:28:28,750 --> 01:28:31,048
Why'd they put it in a jar at all? Why?

1441
01:28:31,119 --> 01:28:32,177
What?

1442
01:28:32,254 --> 01:28:36,691
Why would they go to all that trouble for
someone they'll never see again?

1443
01:28:36,758 --> 01:28:38,157
Because they love him

1444
01:28:38,226 --> 01:28:40,592
and they want to make sure
he'll be okay.

1445
01:28:40,662 --> 01:28:42,186
Because if they know he's okay...

1446
01:28:42,264 --> 01:28:43,663
- Yes, they can let him go.
- You were fabulous.

1447
01:28:43,732 --> 01:28:46,462
Thank you. That's very sweet of you.
Appreciate it.

1448
01:28:46,535 --> 01:28:48,935
Exactly. They can let him go.

1449
01:28:49,838 --> 01:28:52,363
Frank's haunting you, Gwen. Let him go.

1450
01:28:52,441 --> 01:28:54,841
If he's haunting me,
then shouldn't he let me go?

1451
01:28:54,910 --> 01:28:57,344
No. He can't. It's not him. It's you.

1452
01:28:57,412 --> 01:29:01,473
All this stuff about ghosts
having unfinished business,

1453
01:29:01,550 --> 01:29:04,144
it's us that are unfinished.

1454
01:29:04,219 --> 01:29:05,686
Let Frank go.

1455
01:29:06,355 --> 01:29:08,949
Let the pervert decay in peace.

1456
01:29:10,459 --> 01:29:12,723
Please, stop following me.

1457
01:29:17,699 --> 01:29:20,725
- It was wonderful! Thank you so much.
- Yes, it's nice to see you both.

1458
01:29:20,802 --> 01:29:21,894
That came out all wrong.

1459
01:29:21,970 --> 01:29:24,336
I don't care how you knew
all that stuff about Frank, okay?

1460
01:29:24,406 --> 01:29:25,600
- I don't care.
- I told you, I'm trying to...

1461
01:29:25,674 --> 01:29:26,936
Maybe you guys were
a couple of buddies.

1462
01:29:27,008 --> 01:29:28,100
- How about that?
- No, no, no, no, no...

1463
01:29:28,176 --> 01:29:29,404
Two regular guys while he was alive,

1464
01:29:29,478 --> 01:29:32,174
and you went out drinking
and went to strip clubs

1465
01:29:32,247 --> 01:29:33,544
- and talked about your girlfriends...
- Oh, my God.

1466
01:29:33,615 --> 01:29:34,707
...and laughed at your wives...

1467
01:29:34,783 --> 01:29:37,877
- I swear.
- What was the matter with me?

1468
01:29:37,953 --> 01:29:39,614
Why didn't he love me?

1469
01:29:39,688 --> 01:29:41,656
I did love you. I still do.

1470
01:29:41,723 --> 01:29:43,315
He did love you.

1471
01:29:45,494 --> 01:29:47,553
Then why wasn't I enough?

1472
01:29:53,835 --> 01:29:55,359
You've got nothing to say to that,
have you?

1473
01:29:55,437 --> 01:29:56,995
- What?
- Useless.

1474
01:29:57,072 --> 01:29:59,233
Please. What do you think
I'm gonna do, change?

1475
01:29:59,307 --> 01:30:00,467
- Well...
- In all your life,

1476
01:30:00,542 --> 01:30:03,136
have you ever actually known anybody
who's changed at all, ever?

1477
01:30:03,211 --> 01:30:05,304
Why can't you make an effort,
just for a few seconds?

1478
01:30:05,380 --> 01:30:06,404
I am who I am.

1479
01:30:06,481 --> 01:30:07,812
I suppose you're talking
to him right now?

1480
01:30:07,883 --> 01:30:10,044
- Is that what you want me to believe?
- What do you want to tell him?

1481
01:30:10,118 --> 01:30:13,019
- What do you want to say?
- I want an answer!

1482
01:30:13,688 --> 01:30:15,417
I want to know
why I wasn't enough for him.

1483
01:30:15,490 --> 01:30:20,158
It wasn't you that wasn't enough.

1484
01:30:20,228 --> 01:30:22,628
I don't know why I did the shit that I did.

1485
01:30:22,697 --> 01:30:25,222
And he doesn't know
why he did the things he did.

1486
01:30:25,300 --> 01:30:27,734
And you don't get any smarter
just because you're dead.

1487
01:30:27,803 --> 01:30:30,328
You don't get smarter after you die.

1488
01:30:30,405 --> 01:30:33,932
But I did see one thing,
how much I hurt you.

1489
01:30:34,009 --> 01:30:37,570
But he's seen
how much he hurt you. And...

1490
01:30:42,651 --> 01:30:44,414
I'm so sorry, honey.

1491
01:30:46,888 --> 01:30:49,914
- What? What'd he say?
- He said he's sorry.

1492
01:30:52,060 --> 01:30:53,425
That's it?

1493
01:30:54,496 --> 01:30:55,861
He's sorry?

1494
01:30:55,931 --> 01:30:58,229
Well, it was the way he said it, it was...

1495
01:30:58,300 --> 01:31:00,598
He's sorry. He's sorry.

1496
01:31:01,369 --> 01:31:04,770
- Heartfelt.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Heartfelt.

1497
01:31:04,840 --> 01:31:07,638
Good guess. I got to go pack.

1498
01:31:07,709 --> 01:31:10,200
No, you should have heard it!
I'm really not doing it justice!

1499
01:31:11,279 --> 01:31:12,746
Gwen! Wait!

1500
01:31:13,482 --> 01:31:14,779
Why should I talk to you?

1501
01:31:14,850 --> 01:31:17,080
You couldn't even get his dream right!

1502
01:31:17,152 --> 01:31:19,245
No, because he told me the wrong
dream to try to make me look bad.

1503
01:31:19,321 --> 01:31:20,720
He stitched me up.

1504
01:31:20,789 --> 01:31:22,882
Then what's the right one?

1505
01:31:22,958 --> 01:31:23,958
Well, he's not here right now, is he?

1506
01:31:24,025 --> 01:31:25,424
- I can't check with him.
- Oh, that's convenient.

1507
01:31:25,494 --> 01:31:27,325
No, it's not convenient.
It's really inconvenient.

1508
01:31:27,395 --> 01:31:29,386
Listen, I'm not a liar, okay?

1509
01:31:29,464 --> 01:31:32,831
I've been a lot of things.
I've been cold, selfish, self-centered.

1510
01:31:32,901 --> 01:31:34,266
I'm not a liar and I'm not lying now.

1511
01:31:34,336 --> 01:31:36,770
Gwen, I've lived more
in the last few days

1512
01:31:36,838 --> 01:31:42,174
that I've spent with you, since I died,
than I ever lived before I died,

1513
01:31:42,244 --> 01:31:46,010
back when I was living, the first time.
Right? Do you know what I mean?

1514
01:31:46,081 --> 01:31:47,173
Nope.

1515
01:31:47,249 --> 01:31:49,547
Right. I'm born and then...

1516
01:31:57,626 --> 01:31:59,685
Someone call an ambulance!

1517
01:32:00,662 --> 01:32:02,357
Try to get help!

1518
01:32:04,399 --> 01:32:06,390
Somebody do something!

1519
01:32:06,468 --> 01:32:07,901
Oh, my God.

1520
01:32:08,570 --> 01:32:11,505
Now that is a real shame.

1521
01:32:11,573 --> 01:32:13,438
You were really getting
somewhere with her, too.

1522
01:32:13,508 --> 01:32:15,772
- What's happening?
- You ate it, pal.

1523
01:32:15,844 --> 01:32:17,368
Goddamned MTA strikes again.

1524
01:32:17,445 --> 01:32:19,470
These drivers, I mean,
it's a menace, right?

1525
01:32:19,548 --> 01:32:21,243
No! No, I'm not dead!

1526
01:32:21,316 --> 01:32:23,147
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

1527
01:32:25,820 --> 01:32:27,651
I'm sorry, kiddo.

1528
01:32:29,357 --> 01:32:31,450
Come here, you. Kind of nice.

1529
01:32:31,526 --> 01:32:33,687
- Feels good.
- I was just getting started!

1530
01:32:33,762 --> 01:32:36,754
Everything else, every minute up till now
has just been a waste of time!

1531
01:32:36,831 --> 01:32:38,162
Just a warm-up!

1532
01:32:38,233 --> 01:32:39,427
Yeah.

1533
01:32:41,369 --> 01:32:44,202
- This is the worst part.
- Somebody do...

1534
01:32:44,272 --> 01:32:46,240
- Watching her cry.
- Do something!

1535
01:32:46,308 --> 01:32:50,870
Knowing she needs somebody to
comfort her and knowing it can't be you.

1536
01:32:50,946 --> 01:32:52,846
Has anyone called 911?

1537
01:32:52,914 --> 01:32:55,314
- Wait a minute.
- You got to be kidding me.

1538
01:32:55,383 --> 01:32:56,475
Well, call them!

1539
01:32:56,551 --> 01:32:59,987
- Wait a minute.
- Space! Give me space!

1540
01:33:02,390 --> 01:33:05,382
He's doing CPR. He knows CPR.
Of course! He knows CPR.

1541
01:33:05,460 --> 01:33:07,894
Give him space, he needs space.

1542
01:33:07,963 --> 01:33:09,294
He's probably gonna
cut open your chest

1543
01:33:09,364 --> 01:33:11,059
and massage your heart back
to life with his bare hands.

1544
01:33:11,132 --> 01:33:14,260
Oh, Lord! Spare this man!

1545
01:33:14,336 --> 01:33:15,735
Okay, I really can't take
this guy anymore.

1546
01:33:15,804 --> 01:33:18,432
Honestly, really, I can't.

1547
01:33:18,506 --> 01:33:19,734
Come on!

1548
01:33:39,427 --> 01:33:42,624
Hey, Pincus, there's something
I should tell you.

1549
01:33:42,697 --> 01:33:45,222
It might come in handy
if you make it back.

1550
01:33:45,300 --> 01:33:48,030
You're gonna help me? Why?

1551
01:33:48,837 --> 01:33:50,828
Those tears she's crying,

1552
01:33:54,542 --> 01:33:56,442
those are for you, now.

1553
01:34:01,683 --> 01:34:03,048
Listen up.

1554
01:34:06,388 --> 01:34:08,288
I think my ride's here.

1555
01:34:33,581 --> 01:34:36,072
Dr. Pincus, always good to see you.

1556
01:34:36,718 --> 01:34:38,447
What happened?

1557
01:34:38,520 --> 01:34:40,545
You crossed the street when it said,
"Don't walk. "

1558
01:34:40,622 --> 01:34:43,056
Not much of a lawsuit, I'm afraid.

1559
01:34:44,292 --> 01:34:45,384
Gwen.

1560
01:34:46,227 --> 01:34:47,524
Was there a woman here?

1561
01:34:47,595 --> 01:34:50,587
It's possible, but if she was unable
to provide proof of kinship,

1562
01:34:50,665 --> 01:34:53,930
security would have escorted her
off the premises.

1563
01:34:54,002 --> 01:34:55,594
Nice work, guys.

1564
01:35:00,175 --> 01:35:02,871
- You went darker.
- I went darker, yes.

1565
01:35:04,345 --> 01:35:06,836
Looks good. Makes your eyes pop.

1566
01:35:14,422 --> 01:35:15,980
Okay, Mr. Goldman, six months.

1567
01:35:16,057 --> 01:35:18,992
Remember, only floss
the ones you wanna keep.

1568
01:35:20,628 --> 01:35:21,890
Hi.

1569
01:35:32,907 --> 01:35:35,171
I didn't know you were back.

1570
01:35:35,243 --> 01:35:37,268
- Hi.
- Hi.

1571
01:35:37,345 --> 01:35:39,506
I thought you were in Egypt.

1572
01:35:39,914 --> 01:35:43,145
I felt like sticking around. You're okay?

1573
01:35:43,785 --> 01:35:46,083
Yeah. Under the circumstances.

1574
01:35:46,988 --> 01:35:49,786
You know, I tried visiting you
at the hospital, but they wouldn't...

1575
01:35:49,858 --> 01:35:51,758
Yeah, they run a tight ship over there

1576
01:35:51,826 --> 01:35:54,761
at Cooperative Institutional
Health Bastards.

1577
01:35:56,264 --> 01:35:57,856
You okay?

1578
01:35:57,932 --> 01:35:59,957
I have bad molar contact.

1579
01:36:01,302 --> 01:36:03,497
Sit down.
I was wondering if you had that seen to.

1580
01:36:03,571 --> 01:36:06,131
I'm not. I actually made
the appointment with Dr. Prashar.

1581
01:36:06,207 --> 01:36:09,370
- Oh, no, of course. No... He's...
- Well, I didn't know...

1582
01:36:11,045 --> 01:36:12,808
He's a lovely man.

1583
01:36:12,881 --> 01:36:16,840
And he's a better dentist than me,
but don't tell him I said so.

1584
01:36:18,987 --> 01:36:22,252
Anyway, I'm glad to see
you're looking well.

1585
01:36:23,725 --> 01:36:25,158
And you.

1586
01:36:28,163 --> 01:36:30,529
He's eight years old.

1587
01:36:30,598 --> 01:36:32,964
- Sorry? What?
- Frank.

1588
01:36:33,034 --> 01:36:35,264
In his dream. The real one.

1589
01:36:35,336 --> 01:36:37,998
And he's walking in the woods
with his dad.

1590
01:36:38,072 --> 01:36:40,768
He's holding hands,
but then suddenly, his dad's not there.

1591
01:36:40,842 --> 01:36:44,437
He tries to find his way back
the way he came,

1592
01:36:44,512 --> 01:36:47,743
but he keeps ending up
back where he started,

1593
01:36:47,816 --> 01:36:49,716
and that's his nightmare.

1594
01:36:50,118 --> 01:36:53,485
That he's lost
and he can't find his way home.

1595
01:36:53,555 --> 01:36:54,988
That's it.

1596
01:36:56,491 --> 01:36:58,288
Do you still see him?

1597
01:36:59,160 --> 01:37:01,025
He found his way home.

1598
01:37:01,896 --> 01:37:03,295
That's good.

1599
01:37:36,231 --> 01:37:38,096
It hurts when I smile.

1600
01:37:41,936 --> 01:37:43,335
I can fix that for you.
