{1640}{1677}{y:i}In the morning
{1680}{1781}{y:i}when I wake up and listen to the sound
{1807}{1900}{y:i}Of the birds outside on the roof
{1979}{2075}{y:i}I try to ignore what the paper says
{2131}{2237}{y:i}And I try not to read all the news
{2299}{2416}{y:i}And I'll hold you if you had a bad dream
{2453}{2570}{y:i}And I hope it never comes true
{2627}{2743}{y:i}'Cause you and I been through|{y:i}so many things together
{2782}{2883}{y:i}And the sun starts climbing the roof
{2948}{2995}{y:i}It's a dream
{2998}{3065}{y:i}Only a dream
{3106}{3167}{y:i}And it's fading now
{3242}{3293}{y:i}Fading away
{3329}{3388}{y:i}Only a dream
{3433}{3478}{y:i}Just a memory
{3480}{3509}{y:i}without anywhere
{3512}{3602}You come here to make a record,|and you got great musicians...
{3605}{3674}you know, and I always gather|my own friends around...
{3676}{3718}that I pick, you know, to play.
{3721}{3831}I don't really go|for the studio musician guys that much.
{3835}{3910}You know, I don't come in and say,|"Get me this," and "Get me that."
{3913}{3964}But I have my own band.
{3966}{4044}And I like to play on the road|with the same band I use in the studio.
{4046}{4119}I've been working with Neil for 35...|Since '70.
{4178}{4296}And we cut "Harvest" here in Nashville.|He was doing "The Johnny Cash Show..."
{4298}{4377}and he showed up at that studio,|Quadrafonic...
{4379}{4434}down on Grand Avenue, I think.
{4453}{4550}And he wanted to do some music...
{4553}{4632}that he'd written recently,|and this was in the '70s.
{4653}{4715}And he stopped...
{4718}{4776}One of the engineers|stopped a bass player...
{4778}{4826}who was walking down the street...
{4828}{4917}and said, "You wanna come in|and do some music with Neil Young?"
{4919}{4972}And he said, "Sure." So he came in.
{4974}{5030}It was Tim Drummond,|was the bass player's name.
{5054}{5138}And they asked him|if Neil wanted a steel guitar player...
{5141}{5199}and I lived about two blocks|down the street.
{5234}{5311}And so he called me up,|and I came down...
{5314}{5378}and they were|already recording at the time...
{5382}{5461}and I set up my steel|and kind of snuck in there...
{5463}{5529}and started playing.
{5545}{5656}And we did five songs before we ever|stopped and introduced ourselves.
{5672}{5757}My family used to drive up|from Birmingham, Alabama area.
{5822}{5871}And we would go...
{5874}{5926}Try to make it up|at least once a month...
{5929}{5990}but a lot of times we made it up|twice a month...
{5993}{6067}to come to the Ryman|to see the Grand Ole Opry...
{6070}{6182}and have "breakfast with the stars" as|they said down on Broadway back then.
{6203}{6293}It was a little radio show that...
{6297}{6354}the people that was gonna go|to the Ryman that night...
{6356}{6428}could go down and eat breakfast|with all the people...
{6436}{6520}that were sober enough|the next morning...
{6535}{6575}to have breakfast.
{6578}{6640}I've performed at the Ryman one time...
{6642}{6699}with my songwriting friend Dan Penn.
{6704}{6798}And we were invited to play with...
{6800}{6889}They called it the Legendary|Songwriter's Series or something...
{6894}{6938}and that was a lot of fun, you know.
{6941}{7023}And that place has great acoustics,|I think.
{7026}{7058}You know, it's just...
{7076}{7133}You can crank it out|without trying too hard.
{7135}{7217}A lot of, you know, the volume carries|real well there, seem like.
{7219}{7274}The Ryman Auditorium,|there's such a vibe in there.
{7285}{7373}There's this sound in there|that is unlike any other place.
{7421}{7493}And that's really nice|because some places...
{7496}{7558}you come,|and they sound like a big tin can.
{7561}{7594}And there is something about it.
{7597}{7647}Obviously,|there's a lot of stories in this building.
{7650}{7694}And I'm sure glad|they didn't tear it down.
{7697}{7756}They were apparently|gonna tear it down.
{7759}{7810}But now they're building a high rise...
{7813}{7879}on the side where those beautiful|stained glass windows are.
{7882}{7935}It's gonna block out the light.
{7938}{7984}And I don't know how anybody could...
{7986}{8023}That should be illegal.
{8026}{8144}You know, like, the artistic police|or the aesthetic police should...
{8179}{8249}if there was such a thing,|should come and arrest them.
{8278}{8341}On this last project, I mean,|he made a statement to me...
{8343}{8371}and I didn't believe it.
{8378}{8493}He said, "It's been two years|since I've wrote something, right?"
{8495}{8565}And when he got to the hotel|around his old buddies again...
{8567}{8609}you couldn't get him from writing.
{8612}{8661}You couldn't stop him from writing,|you know.
{8663}{8688}That's just how it comes.
{8690}{8779}- I had no idea that there was.|- But there was a little, to be honest...
{8783}{8809}there was a little bit of, kind of...
{8812}{8848}We just picked up on a little bit of, like...
{8850}{8916}something's going on.|We don't know what's going on, exactly.
{8918}{9004}When he made this record, it was right|after he found out he had the aneurysm.
{9006}{9086}And I think of it as like,|his life flashing before his eyes.
{9090}{9195}And just remembering all these things,|and wanting to say these things.
{9198}{9234}'Cause, you know, you don't...
{9237}{9290}We didn't really know|what was gonna happen.
{9294}{9358}He said, "I got this brain aneurysm."
{9362}{9473}And, I mean, the world stopped.|To me, it was just like, "You what?"
{9478}{9564}And he said, "Yeah.|I've got this brain aneurysm...
{9566}{9643}"and I'm gonna go to New York|next Tuesday...
{9646}{9719}"and they're gonna...|You know, they're gonna do this thing."
{9723}{9775}He goes, "And it's really wild,|what they're gonna do."
{9778}{9806}I said, "Well, what are they gonna do?"
{9809}{9886}He said,|"Well, they're gonna go in there...
{9889}{9982}"and they're gonna put|these little bitty springs in there...
{9988}{10079}"and they're biodegradable.|And what that does is, that makes...
{10086}{10179}"the body produce the scar tissue,|which then negates the aneurysm."
{10182}{10244}I'm sitting there going, "What?"|You know.
{10246}{10328}And,|"Why are you sitting here right now?
{10332}{10382}"How is that?" You know.
{10385}{10473}"How can it be|that you're going there next Tuesday...
{10476}{10533}"and we're sitting here recording?"
{10538}{10589}I'm just going, "What's..."
{11173}{11245}{y:i}Prairie wind blowing through my head
{11361}{11430}{y:i}Prairie wind blowing through my head
{11484}{11585}We don't use a tenor saxophone,|we use two baritone parts instead...
{11590}{11669}so that the part of the tenor|has a lot of bite to it.
{11713}{11803}{y:i}Trying to remember what Daddy said
{12154}{12249}B45. "Heart of Gold,"|written and recorded. "Old Man..."
{12288}{12330}{y:i}Check. One, two.
{12345}{12373}{y:i}You wanna come out?
{12376}{12408}{y:i}Check. One, two. Check. One, two.
{12408}{12442}{y:i}Check. One, two. Check. One, two.
{12724}{12772}All right.|Just keep this with you all night.
{12774}{12845}Every time you come outside|you need it to get back in. Thanks.
{12965}{13020}{y:i}I just wanna play well and I wanna...
{13022}{13077}{y:i}you know,|{y:i}share the stage with my friends...
{13082}{13122}{y:i}give the best I can.
{13130}{13215}{y:i}We're gonna get in there|{y:i}and let the muse have us.
{13224}{13253}{y:i}Take a shot.
{13279}{13306}{y:i}Send it out.
{13633}{13704}{y:i}Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,|{y:i}and welcome to the Ryman.
{13706}{13781}{y:i}And the world premiere|"of Neil Young's" Prairie Wind.
{14104}{14157}{y:i}The painter stood
{14166}{14209}{y:i}Before her work
{14227}{14304}{y:i}She looked around everywhere
{14364}{14456}{y:i}She saw the pictures|{y:i}and she painted them
{14508}{14581}{y:i}Picking colors from the air
{14645}{14697}{y:i}Green to green
{14715}{14750}{y:i}Red to red
{14770}{14856}{y:i}Yellow to yellow|{y:i}In the light
{14912}{15008}{y:i}Black to black|{y:i}When the evening comes
{15047}{15128}{y:i}Blue to blue|{y:i}Through the night
{15418}{15473}{y:i}It's a long road
{15560}{15613}{y:i}Behind me
{15686}{15740}{y:i}It's a long road
{15830}{15884}{y:i}Ahead
{15886}{15997}{y:i}If you follow every dream
{16015}{16070}{y:i}You might get lost
{16147}{16257}{y:i}If you follow every dream
{16301}{16336}{y:i}You might
{16338}{16372}{y:i}Get
{16374}{16415}{y:i}Lost
{16642}{16698}{y:i}She toed the line
{16710}{16762}{y:i}She held her end up
{16777}{16857}{y:i}She did the work of two men
{16907}{16993}{y:i}But in the end|{y:i}She fell down
{17043}{17121}{y:i}Before she got up again
{17178}{17282}{y:i}I have my friends eternally
{17312}{17397}{y:i}We leave our tracks in the sound
{17460}{17540}{y:i}Some of them are with me now
{17590}{17672}{y:i}Some of them can't be found
{17962}{18014}{y:i}It's a long road
{18107}{18152}{y:i}Behind me
{18222}{18285}{y:i}And I miss you now
{18426}{18538}{y:i}If you follow every dream
{18553}{18628}{y:i}You might get lost
{18697}{18810}{y:i}If you follow every dream
{18835}{18878}{y:i}You might
{18881}{18913}{y:i}Get
{18916}{18955}{y:i}Lost
{19195}{19248}{y:i}Green to green
{19266}{19309}{y:i}Red to red
{19321}{19392}{y:i}Yellow to yellow|{y:i}In the light
{19458}{19543}{y:i}Black to black|{y:i}When the evening comes
{19590}{19674}{y:i}Blue to blue|{y:i}Through the night
{20438}{20513}{y:i}See the bluebird fly
{20515}{20584}{y:i}easy as a dream
{20586}{20650}{y:i}Dipping and bobbing in the sun
{20723}{20777}{y:i}Could she be the one
{20782}{20841}{y:i}I saw so long ago
{20872}{20967}{y:i}Could she be the one to take me home
{21005}{21062}{y:i}This pasture is green
{21070}{21131}{y:i}I'm walking in the sun
{21144}{21229}{y:i}It's turning brown|{y:i}I'm standing in the rain
{21279}{21341}{y:i}My overcoat is worn
{21344}{21409}{y:i}The pockets are all torn
{21420}{21500}{y:i}I'm moving away from the pain
{21569}{21616}{y:i}Tick-tock
{21633}{21685}{y:i}The clock on the wall
{21701}{21782}{y:i}No wonder we're losing time
{21845}{21901}{y:i}Ring, ring
{21914}{21969}{y:i}The old church bell
{21985}{22092}{y:i}The bride and her love
{22114}{22230}{y:i}Seeking guidance from above
{22674}{22789}{y:i}Amber waves of grain|{y:i}bow in the prairie wind
{22810}{22927}{y:i}I'm hearing Willie singing|{y:i}on the radio again
{22949}{23068}{y:i}That song from 9/11|{y:i}keeps ringing in my head
{23090}{23205}{y:i}I'll always remember|{y:i}something Chris Rock said
{23227}{23285}{y:i}Don't send no more candles
{23294}{23344}{y:i}No matter what you do
{23359}{23413}{y:i}Then Willie stopped singing
{23428}{23485}{y:i}And the prairie wind blew
{23502}{23619}{y:i}The green kept rolling on|{y:i}For miles and miles
{23652}{23741}{y:i}Fields of fuel rolling on for miles
{23787}{23836}{y:i}Tick-tock
{23857}{23919}{y:i}The clock on the wall
{23922}{24004}{y:i}No wonder we're losing time
{24064}{24128}{y:i}Toll, toll
{24137}{24196}{y:i}The fallen soldier bell
{24202}{24294}{y:i}The old church on the hill
{24338}{24455}{y:i}Still standing when so many fell
{25162}{25276}{y:i}Back when I was young|{y:i}the birds blocked out the sun
{25290}{25363}{y:i}Before the great migration south
{25432}{25548}{y:i}We only shot a few|{y:i}They last the winter through
{25566}{25656}{y:i}Mother cooked them good|{y:i}and served them up
{25710}{25821}{y:i}Somewhere a senator|{y:i}sits in a leather chair
{25841}{25939}{y:i}Behind a big wooden desk
{25976}{26091}{y:i}The caribou we kill|{y:i}mean nothing to him
{26107}{26210}{y:i}He took his money just like all the rest
{26248}{26297}{y:i}Tick-tock
{26322}{26367}{y:i}The clock on the wall
{26382}{26479}{y:i}No wonder we're losing time
{26531}{26581}{y:i}Ring, ring
{26599}{26663}{y:i}Ring the wedding bells
{26669}{26774}{y:i}The bride takes the ring
{26794}{26900}{y:i}And the happy people sing
{29068}{29110}{y:i}I just want to thank you
{29113}{29182}{y:i}For all of the things you've done
{29259}{29325}{y:i}I've been thinking about you
{29328}{29403}{y:i}I just want to send my love
{29491}{29550}{y:i}I send my best to you
{29552}{29622}{y:i}That's my message of love
{29702}{29793}{y:i}For all the things you did|{y:i}I never thank you enough
{29898}{29947}{y:i}Feel like I'm falling
{29951}{30028}{y:i}Falling off the face of the Earth
{30058}{30133}{y:i}Falling off the face of the Earth
{30163}{30235}{y:i}Falling off the face of the Earth
{30270}{30343}{y:i}Falling off the face of the Earth
{30947}{30997}{y:i}I just want to tell you
{31002}{31069}{y:i}You sure mean a lot to me
{31158}{31200}{y:i}It may sound simple
{31202}{31272}{y:i}But you are the world to me
{31376}{31420}{y:i}It's such a precious thing
{31422}{31473}{y:i}The time we shared together
{31580}{31633}{y:i}I must apologize
{31636}{31682}{y:i}For the troubled times
{31785}{31828}{y:i}Feel like I'm falling
{31838}{31896}{y:i}Falling off the face of the Earth
{31940}{31997}{y:i}Falling off the face of the Earth
{32042}{32112}{y:i}Falling off the face of the Earth
{32157}{32233}{y:i}Falling off the face of the Earth
{32827}{32884}{y:i}Feel like I'm falling
{32886}{32963}{y:i}Falling off the face of the Earth
{32987}{33040}{y:i}Falling off the face of the Earth
{33090}{33145}{y:i}Falling off the face of the Earth
{33200}{33251}{y:i}Falling off the face of the Earth
{33302}{33353}{y:i}Falling off the face of the Earth
{33458}{33505}{y:i}Feel like I'm falling
{33507}{33562}{y:i}Falling off the face of the Earth
{34412}{34449}This is a song here...
{34451}{34513}When I first started playing guitar...
{34526}{34585}I was a chicken farmer at the time...
{34604}{34679}I was about seven|or eight years old or something and...
{34682}{34721}Maybe a little older than that.
{34735}{34841}But my daddy brought me|an Arthur Godfrey ukulele...
{34843}{34885}a little plastic one.
{34898}{34963}And, now, I didn't know|what to do with it or anything...
{34966}{35020}but he said, "You might need this."
{35023}{35110}And then he sang me a song...
{35158}{35191}which I never heard him sing before,|or anything.
{35194}{35263}And then he got this funny grin|on his face and he was looking at me.
{35266}{35310}And I was watching him.
{35324}{35389}Then I had to go feed the chickens.
{35510}{35558}One, two, three...
{35947}{36021}{y:i}When I was a growing boy
{36037}{36107}{y:i}Rocking on my daddy's knee
{36145}{36218}{y:i}Daddy took an old guitar and sang
{36242}{36296}{y:i}Bury me on the Ione prairie
{36324}{36389}{y:i}Uncle Bob sat at the piano
{36422}{36490}{y:i}My girl cousins sang harmony
{36532}{36612}{y:i}Those were the good old family times
{36633}{36695}{y:i}That left a big mark on me
{37130}{37193}{y:i}Bury me out on the prairie
{37219}{37292}{y:i}Where the buffalo used to roam
{37311}{37397}{y:i}Where the Canada geese|{y:i}once filled the sky
{37424}{37489}{y:i}And then I won't be far from home
{37519}{37586}{y:i}Yeah, bury me out on the prairie
{37610}{37682}{y:i}Where the buffalo used to roam
{37718}{37807}{y:i}You won't have to shed a tear for me
{37819}{37890}{y:i}'Cause then I won't be far from home
{38314}{38383}{y:i}Out on the Trans-Canada Highway
{38402}{38471}{y:i}I was talking to a firefly
{38511}{38593}{y:i}Trying to make my way|{y:i}to Nashville, Tennessee
{38602}{38668}{y:i}When another car passed me by
{38691}{38762}{y:i}Some day I'm gonna make big money
{38798}{38865}{y:i}And buy myself a big old car
{38882}{38967}{y:i}Make my way on down|{y:i}to the Promised Land
{38997}{39073}{y:i}And then I'm gonna really go far
{39482}{39552}{y:i}Bury me out on the prairie
{39575}{39647}{y:i}Where the buffalo used to roam
{39675}{39756}{y:i}Where the Canada geese|{y:i}once filled the sky
{39776}{39848}{y:i}And then I won't be far from home
{39866}{39943}{y:i}Just bury me out on the prairie
{39962}{40036}{y:i}Where the buffalo used to roam
{40064}{40157}{y:i}You won't have to shed a tear for me
{40166}{40237}{y:i}'Cause then I won't be far from home
{40951}{40989}You know,|to look around Nashville today...
{40991}{41057}there's a lot more cars,|there's a lot more new buildings.
{41060}{41133}I often wonder what Hank Williams|would have thought...
{41154}{41218}if he stepped out of that stage door...
{41221}{41255}on his way to Tootsie's, and looked up...
{41258}{41322}and saw the Gaylord|Entertainment Center sitting there.
{41406}{41497}So things have changed, I think.|But the spirit's still here...
{41514}{41567}and that's a beautiful thing.
{42120}{42162}{y:i}In the morning
{42165}{42264}{y:i}when I wake up and listen to the sound
{42294}{42393}{y:i}Of the birds outside on the roof
{42474}{42588}{y:i}I try to ignore what the paper says
{42635}{42745}{y:i}And I try not to read all the news
{42806}{42919}{y:i}And I'll hold you if you had a bad dream
{42978}{43088}{y:i}And I hope that it never comes true
{43155}{43268}{y:i}'Cause you and I been through|{y:i}so many things together
{43319}{43428}{y:i}And the sun starts climbing the roof
{43492}{43538}{y:i}It's a dream
{43541}{43596}{y:i}It's only a dream
{43658}{43714}{y:i}Just a memory
{43796}{43842}{y:i}Fading away
{43884}{43942}{y:i}It's only a dream
{43995}{44051}{y:i}Just a memory
{44062}{44099}{y:i}without anywhere
{44168}{44209}{y:i}to stay
{44503}{44620}{y:i}Red River still flows|{y:i}through my hometown
{44692}{44785}{y:i}Rollin' and tumblin' on its way
{44857}{44960}{y:i}Swirling around the old bridge pylons
{45018}{45117}{y:i}Where a boy fishes the morning away
{45198}{45308}{y:i}A bicycle leans on an oak tree
{45362}{45471}{y:i}While the cars rumble over his head
{45539}{45655}{y:i}An airplane leaves a trail|{y:i}in an empty blue sky
{45702}{45789}{y:i}And the young birds call out to be fed
{45858}{45897}{y:i}It's a dream
{45910}{45965}{y:i}It's only a dream
{46025}{46084}{y:i}And it's fading now
{46165}{46214}{y:i}Fading away
{46243}{46300}{y:i}It's only a dream
{46359}{46408}{y:i}Just a memory
{46413}{46469}{y:i}without anywhere
{46534}{46581}{y:i}to stay
{47226}{47342}{y:i}An old man walks along on the sidewalk
{47382}{47495}{y:i}With sunglasses and an old Stetson hat
{47566}{47683}{y:i}The four winds blow the back|{y:i}of his overcoat away
{47729}{47809}{y:i}As he stops with a policeman to chat
{47895}{47997}{y:i}And a train rolls out of the station
{48058}{48170}{y:i}That was really something in its day
{48233}{48280}{y:i}Picking up speed
{48303}{48362}{y:i}on the straight prairie rails
{48397}{48508}{y:i}As it carries its passengers away
{48558}{48602}{y:i}It's gone
{48605}{48666}{y:i}It's only a dream
{48720}{48773}{y:i}And it's fading now
{48855}{48906}{y:i}Fading away
{48938}{48990}{y:i}It's only a dream
{49056}{49106}{y:i}Just a memory
{49109}{49153}{y:i}without anywhere
{49229}{49285}{y:i}to stay
{49565}{49611}{y:i}It's a dream
{49614}{49668}{y:i}It's only a dream
{49731}{49787}{y:i}And it's fading now
{49871}{49921}{y:i}Fading away
{49951}{50008}{y:i}It's only a dream
{50083}{50115}{y:i}Just a memory
{50118}{50166}{y:i}without anywhere
{50238}{50286}{y:i}to stay
{50574}{50620}{y:i}It's a dream
{50628}{50681}{y:i}It's only a dream
{50746}{50807}{y:i}And it's fading now
{50893}{50940}{y:i}Fading away
{51658}{51701}Thank you, Nashville.
{52070}{52139}Well, it sure is great to be here tonight|with all of you.
{52302}{52398}You know, getting to be|about that time, some of us are...
{52409}{52468}starting to lose our parents and stuff.
{52522}{52599}My daddy passed away|a couple of months ago...
{52664}{52736}and in the last part of his life,|he had dementia.
{52763}{52799}And that's...
{52810}{52882}I know some of you know|what that's like...
{52934}{53033}and it's something else to see|your loved ones living in the moment.
{53048}{53076}But...
{53116}{53188}when he passed,|we had a nice service for him...
{53198}{53274}and my little cousin, or niece...
{53278}{53354}she was about this high, and|she came up to me, said, you know:
{53360}{53454}"Daddy was okay.|He knew what was going on.
{53555}{53614}"Once a police car pulled up|behind him...
{53633}{53686}"right behind him,|there was this police car...
{53689}{53730}"and he said, 'Cop.'
{53759}{53806}"So I know he was okay."
{54884}{54973}{y:i}Trying to remember what my daddy said
{55063}{55161}{y:i}Before too much time|{y:i}took away his head
{55253}{55367}{y:i}He said we're gonna go back|{y:i}and I'll show you what I'm talking about
{55454}{55573}{y:i}Back to Cypress River|{y:i}back to the old farmhouse
{55757}{55849}{y:i}Prairie wind blowing through my head
{55950}{56044}{y:i}Prairie wind blowing through my head
{56127}{56194}{y:i}Trying to remember what Daddy said
{56329}{56400}{y:i}Prairie wind blowing through my head
{56403}{56508}{y:i}Well, I tried to tell the people|{y:i}but they never heard a word I said
{56582}{56681}{y:i}They say there's nothing out there|{y:i}but wheat fields anyway
{56781}{56876}{y:i}Just a farmer's wife hanging laundry|{y:i}in her back yard
{56978}{57077}{y:i}Out on the prairie|{y:i}where the wind blows long and hard
{57281}{57367}{y:i}Prairie wind blowing through my head
{57472}{57556}{y:i}Prairie wind blowing through my head
{57650}{57725}{y:i}Trying to remember what Daddy said
{57850}{57926}{y:i}Prairie wind blowing through my head
{58497}{58589}{y:i}Late at night|{y:i}lights dancing in the northern sky
{58859}{58967}{y:i}Just the Indian spirits|{y:i}trying to show me how to fly
{59237}{59348}{y:i}You can see into the future|{y:i}but it may be a mirage
{59616}{59725}{y:i}Like a new car sitting there|{y:i}in your old garage
{59922}{59998}{y:i}Prairie wind blowing through my head
{60107}{60178}{y:i}Prairie wind blowing through my head
{60738}{60843}{y:i}Well, there's a place on the prairie|{y:i}where evil and goodness play
{60933}{61037}{y:i}Daddy told me all about it|{y:i}but I don't remember what he said
{61104}{61152}{y:i}Well, it may be afternoon
{61155}{61224}{y:i}and it may be the dead of night
{61298}{61408}{y:i}But you'll know when you see it|{y:i}'cause it sure is a hell of a sight
{61600}{61677}{y:i}Prairie wind blowing through my head
{61694}{61773}{y:i}Prairie wind blowing through my head
{61790}{61843}{y:i}Prairie wind blowing through my head
{61862}{61941}{y:i}Trying to remember what my daddy said
{61975}{62043}{y:i}Prairie wind blowing through my head
{62046}{62124}{y:i}Before too much time|{y:i}took away his head
{62162}{62229}{y:i}Prairie wind blowing through my head
{62232}{62347}{y:i}So we're gonna go back|{y:i}and I'll show you what I'm talking about
{62350}{62421}{y:i}Prairie wind blowing through my head
{62537}{62607}{y:i}Prairie wind blowing through my head
{62610}{62724}{y:i}Going back to Cypress River|{y:i}back to the old farmhouse
{62726}{62793}{y:i}Prairie wind blowing through my head
{62910}{62981}{y:i}Prairie wind blowing through my head
{63098}{63166}{y:i}Prairie wind blowing through my head
{63290}{63360}{y:i}Prairie wind blowing through my head
{63478}{63554}{y:i}Prairie wind blowing through my head
{63667}{63743}{y:i}Prairie wind blowing through my head
{64282}{64313}Thank you.
{64433}{64496}You know, I got a beautiful young girl.
{64517}{64586}She's just turned 21.
{64612}{64706}She's going back|for her last year of college pretty soon.
{64773}{64857}She'd probably be embarrassed|if I said anything more about her.
{64871}{64938}You know how that is? Can't say much.
{64993}{65075}Anyway, there was a time|I used to write these kind of songs...
{65078}{65121}for girls my own age.
{65277}{65361}- You still got a few good years.|- Yeah. I got a few left in me.
{65579}{65670}So this is what you might call|kind of an empty-nester song.
{65690}{65721}It's a new genre...
{65723}{65806}and they might even have|a new kind of radio station for them.
{66287}{66377}{y:i}When your summer days|{y:i}come tumbling down
{66394}{66466}{y:i}And you find yourself alone
{66500}{66562}{y:i}You can come back
{66576}{66619}{y:i}and be with me
{66703}{66786}{y:i}Just close your eyes and I'll be there
{66834}{66889}{y:i}Listen to the sound
{66920}{66978}{y:i}Of this old heart
{66999}{67063}{y:i}beating for you
{67162}{67209}{y:i}Yes, I miss you
{67245}{67319}{y:i}But I never want to hold you down
{67372}{67410}{y:i}You might say
{67424}{67480}{y:i}I'm here for you
{68006}{68085}{y:i}When the winter comes|{y:i}to your new home
{68110}{68182}{y:i}And snowflakes are falling down
{68204}{68252}{y:i}You can come back
{68292}{68334}{y:i}and be with me
{68426}{68506}{y:i}Just close your eyes and I'll be there
{68546}{68604}{y:i}Listen to the sound
{68631}{68672}{y:i}Of this old heart
{68717}{68771}{y:i}beating for you
{68871}{68922}{y:i}Yes, I miss you
{68950}{69021}{y:i}But I never want to hold you down
{69083}{69134}{y:i}You might say
{69158}{69211}{y:i}I'm here for you
{69317}{69424}{y:i}In the spring|{y:i}protective arms surrounded you
{69525}{69604}{y:i}In the fall, we let you go your way
{69728}{69844}{y:i}Happiness I know will always find you
{69946}{70047}{y:i}And when it does, I hope that it will stay
{70986}{71026}{y:i}Yes, I miss you
{71057}{71149}{y:i}But I never want to hold you down
{71195}{71240}{y:i}You might say
{71267}{71324}{y:i}I'm here for you
{71430}{71485}{y:i}Yes, I miss you
{71502}{71594}{y:i}But I never want to hold you down
{71638}{71666}{y:i}You might say
{71701}{71765}{y:i}I'm here for you
{71848}{71888}{y:i}I'll always be
{71924}{71994}{y:i}here for you
{72276}{72308}Thank you.
{72552}{72584}You know...
{72606}{72704}one of my favorite guitars in the world|is Willie Nelson's guitar...
{72712}{72760}and the way it looks.
{72805}{72843}And this guitar here...
{72860}{72924}my friend Grant, Grant Boatwright...
{72930}{73007}found this guitar for me|about 30 years ago...
{73017}{73073}and I bought it from Tuck Taylor.
{73085}{73151}And this is Hank's old guitar.
{73342}{73453}It was here in 1951, I think,|and that was Hank's last show here.
{73460}{73512}Maybe, I think it was...
{73522}{73575}Maybe he got back.|He got fired, I know that.
{73578}{73656}But maybe he came back|one more time, I'm not sure but...
{73672}{73754}don't think so.|So I'm glad to see it back here...
{73757}{73792}and I'm glad...
{74229}{74274}Anyway, here's a tune for you.
{74486}{74562}{y:i}This old guitar ain't mine to keep
{74643}{74707}{y:i}I'm taking care of it now
{74804}{74898}{y:i}It's been around for years and years
{74956}{75033}{y:i}Just waiting in its old case
{75108}{75209}{y:i}It's been up and down the country roads
{75286}{75357}{y:i}It brought a tear and a smile
{75438}{75529}{y:i}It's had its share of dreams and hopes
{75603}{75676}{y:i}It never went out of style
{75759}{75850}{y:i}The more I play it, the better it sounds
{75923}{75991}{y:i}It cries when I leave it alone
{76079}{76162}{y:i}Silently it waits for me
{76239}{76299}{y:i}Or someone else I suppose
{76398}{76437}{y:i}This old guitar
{76585}{76638}{y:i}This old guitar
{76718}{76757}{y:i}This old guitar
{77558}{77645}{y:i}This old guitar has caught some breaks
{77706}{77776}{y:i}But it never searched for gold
{77868}{77961}{y:i}It can't be blamed for my mistakes
{78028}{78096}{y:i}It only does what it's told
{78183}{78266}{y:i}It's been a messenger|{y:i}in times of trouble
{78337}{78400}{y:i}In times of hope and fear
{78493}{78577}{y:i}When I get drunk and seeing double
{78646}{78731}{y:i}It jumps behind the wheel and steers
{78802}{78893}{y:i}This old guitar ain't mine to keep
{78960}{79022}{y:i}It's mine to play for a while
{79115}{79198}{y:i}This old guitar ain't mine to keep
{79274}{79335}{y:i}It's only mine for a while
{79429}{79477}{y:i}This old guitar
{79608}{79659}{y:i}This old guitar
{79736}{79782}{y:i}This old guitar
{79914}{79969}{y:i}This old guitar
{80042}{80097}{y:i}This old guitar
{80962}{81033}{y:i}Was he thinkin' about my country
{81091}{81176}{y:i}Or the color of my skin?
{81222}{81307}{y:i}Was he thinkin' about my religion
{81353}{81442}{y:i}And the way I worshipped him?
{81487}{81588}{y:i}Did he create just me in his image
{81629}{81718}{y:i}Or every living thing?
{81770}{81863}{y:i}When God made me
{81908}{82001}{y:i}When God made me
{82306}{82399}{y:i}Was he planning only for believers
{82436}{82523}{y:i}Or for those who just have faith?
{82570}{82654}{y:i}Did he envision all the wars
{82701}{82787}{y:i}That were fought in his name?
{82832}{82919}{y:i}Did he think there was only one way
{82985}{83043}{y:i}To be close to him?
{83102}{83199}{y:i}When God made me
{83241}{83337}{y:i}When God made me
{83650}{83723}{y:i}Did he give us the gift of love
{83785}{83869}{y:i}To say who we could choose?
{83925}{84023}{y:i}When God made me
{84067}{84164}{y:i}When God made me
{84203}{84299}{y:i}When God made me
{84353}{84448}{y:i}When God made me
{84486}{84552}{y:i}Did he give me the gift of voice
{84614}{84676}{y:i}So some could silence me?
{84749}{84832}{y:i}Did he give me the gift of vision
{84882}{84972}{y:i}Not knowing what I might see?
{85012}{85100}{y:i}Did he give us the gift of compassion
{85156}{85242}{y:i}To help our fellow man?
{85290}{85388}{y:i}When God made me
{85440}{85534}{y:i}When God made me
{85584}{85680}{y:i}When God made me
{85727}{85824}{y:i}When God made me
{86782}{86834}{y:i}I am a child
{86855}{86904}{y:i}I'll last a while
{86926}{86968}{y:i}You can't conceive
{86983}{87040}{y:i}of the pleasure in my smile
{87077}{87128}{y:i}You hold my hand
{87149}{87207}{y:i}rough up my hair
{87226}{87302}{y:i}It's lots of fun|{y:i}to have you there
{87373}{87471}{y:i}I gave to you|{y:i}now you give to me
{87519}{87596}{y:i}I'd like to know|{y:i}what you've learned
{87663}{87774}{y:i}The sky is blue|{y:i}and so is the sea
{87814}{87858}{y:i}What is the color
{87881}{87937}{y:i}when black is burned?
{87962}{88013}{y:i}What is the color?
{88388}{88435}{y:i}You are a man
{88457}{88505}{y:i}you understand
{88529}{88572}{y:i}You pick me up
{88574}{88636}{y:i}then you lay me down again
{88674}{88729}{y:i}You make the rules
{88745}{88800}{y:i}you say what's fair
{88816}{88891}{y:i}It's lots of fun|{y:i}to have you there
{88960}{89062}{y:i}I gave to you|{y:i}now you give to me
{89106}{89181}{y:i}I'd like to know|{y:i}what you've learned
{89250}{89324}{y:i}The sky is blue|{y:i}and so is the sea
{89401}{89448}{y:i}What is the color
{89464}{89521}{y:i}when black is burned?
{89545}{89590}{y:i}What is the color?
{90726}{90798}{y:i}Come a little bit closer
{90832}{90894}{y:i}Hear what I have to say
{91137}{91203}{y:i}Just like children sleeping
{91250}{91312}{y:i}We could dream this night away
{91544}{91612}{y:i}But there's a full moon rising
{91650}{91719}{y:i}Let's go dancing in the light
{91965}{92030}{y:i}We know where the music's playing
{92069}{92148}{y:i}Let's go out and feel the night
{92381}{92466}{y:i}Because I'm still in love with you
{92499}{92571}{y:i}I want to see you dance again
{92595}{92682}{y:i}Because I'm still in love with you
{92721}{92783}{y:i}On this harvest moon
{93243}{93304}{y:i}When we were strangers
{93346}{93409}{y:i}I watched you from afar
{93663}{93717}{y:i}When we were lovers
{93755}{93840}{y:i}I loved you with all my heart
{94058}{94123}{y:i}But now it's gettin' late
{94175}{94242}{y:i}And the moon is climbin' high
{94469}{94540}{y:i}I want to celebrate
{94587}{94676}{y:i}See it shinin' in your eye
{94898}{94993}{y:i}Because I'm still in love with you
{95017}{95088}{y:i}I want to see you dance again
{95120}{95197}{y:i}Because I'm still in love with you
{95243}{95304}{y:i}On this harvest moon
{96557}{96658}{y:i}Because I'm still in love with you
{96675}{96745}{y:i}I want to see you dance again
{96773}{96847}{y:i}Because I'm still in love with you
{96897}{96954}{y:i}On this harvest moon
{97346}{97399}{y:i}Harvest moon
{98469}{98524}{y:i}I want to live
{98537}{98588}{y:i}I want to give
{98607}{98704}{y:i}I've been a miner|{y:i}for a heart of gold

{102416}{102485}About that time when I wrote that song|and I was touring...
{102488}{102524}I had also...
{102539}{102618}just, you know,|being a rich hippie for the first time...
{102625}{102676}had purchased a ranch.
{102690}{102722}And...
{102738}{102798}I still live there today.
{102809}{102876}And there was a couple living on it...
{102879}{102937}that were the caretakers and...
{102970}{103048}Old gentleman named Louis Avela...
{103052}{103091}and his wife, Clara.
{103104}{103156}And there was this old blue jeep there.
{103159}{103227}And Louis took me for a...
{103255}{103296}took me for a ride...
{103303}{103345}in this blue jeep.
{103353}{103418}And he gets me up there|on the top side of the place...
{103421}{103507}and there's this lake up there|that fed all the pastures...
{103509}{103576}and he says, "Well, tell me,|how does a young man like yourself...
{103579}{103640}"have enough money|to buy a place like this?"
{103656}{103752}And I said, "Well, I'm just lucky, Louis.|Just real lucky."
{103770}{103848}He said, "Well,|that's the darnedest thing I ever heard."
{103940}{103985}And then I wrote this song for him.
{104438}{104496}{y:i}Old man, look at my life
{104514}{104592}{y:i}I'm a lot like you were
{104653}{104713}{y:i}Old man, look at my life
{104728}{104807}{y:i}I'm a lot like you were
{105121}{105180}{y:i}Old man, look at my life
{105206}{105277}{y:i}Twenty-four|{y:i}and there's so much more
{105287}{105352}{y:i}Live alone in a paradise
{105360}{105425}{y:i}That makes me think of two
{105456}{105519}{y:i}Love lost, such a cost
{105537}{105609}{y:i}Give me things|{y:i}that don't get lost
{105623}{105695}{y:i}Like a coin that won't get tossed
{105697}{105755}{y:i}Rolling home to you
{105955}{106015}{y:i}Old man, take a look at my life
{106017}{106072}{y:i}I'm a lot like you
{106121}{106180}{y:i}I need someone to love me
{106182}{106244}{y:i}the whole day through
{106285}{106348}{y:i}Ah, one look in my eyes
{106355}{106417}{y:i}and you can tell that's true
{106792}{106861}{y:i}Lullabies, look in your eyes
{106877}{106946}{y:i}Run around in the same old town
{106958}{107028}{y:i}Doesn't mean that much to me
{107030}{107095}{y:i}To mean that much to you
{107125}{107189}{y:i}I've been first and last
{107208}{107280}{y:i}Look at how the time goes past
{107297}{107359}{y:i}But I'm all alone at last
{107368}{107419}{y:i}Rolling home to you
{107623}{107687}{y:i}Old man, take a look at my life
{107689}{107747}{y:i}I'm a lot like you
{107790}{107852}{y:i}I need someone to love me
{107854}{107916}{y:i}the whole day through
{107960}{108020}{y:i}Ah, one look in my eyes
{108022}{108088}{y:i}and you can tell that's true
{108343}{108402}{y:i}Old man, look at my life
{108414}{108476}{y:i}I'm a lot like you were
{108553}{108610}{y:i}Old man, look at my life
{108625}{108688}{y:i}I'm a lot like you were
{109479}{109560}{y:i}I caught you knockin'|{y:i}at my cellar door
{109583}{109662}{y:i}I love you, baby|{y:i}can I have some more
{109691}{109794}{y:i}Oh, the damage done
{109884}{109955}{y:i}I hit the city|{y:i}and I lost my band
{109983}{110060}{y:i}I watched the needle|{y:i}take another man
{110088}{110195}{y:i}Gone, gone, the damage done
{110692}{110768}{y:i}I sing the song|{y:i}because I love the man
{110790}{110866}{y:i}I know that some|{y:i}of you don't understand
{110897}{110945}{y:i}Milk-blood
{110957}{111069}{y:i}to keep from running out
{111097}{111172}{y:i}I've seen the needle|{y:i}and the damage done
{111199}{111270}{y:i}A little part of it in everyone
{111301}{111369}{y:i}But every junkie's|{y:i}like a settin' sun
{112597}{112664}{y:i}King went a-runnin' after deer
{112667}{112731}{y:i}Wasn't scared of jumpin'|{y:i}off the truck in high gear
{112733}{112800}{y:i}King went a-sniffin'|{y:i}and he would go
{112802}{112904}{y:i}Was the best old hound dog|{y:i}I ever did know
{112908}{112970}{y:i}I had a dog and his name was King
{112973}{113041}{y:i}I told the dog about everything
{113044}{113107}"There in my truck, the dog and I
{113111}{113188}{y:i}Then one day the King up and died
{113457}{113532}{y:i}Then I thought about|{y:i}the times we had
{113534}{113599}{y:i}Once when I kicked him|{y:i}when he was bad
{113602}{113663}{y:i}Old King sure meant a lot to me
{113665}{113767}{y:i}But that hound dog is history
{114018}{114086}{y:i}King went a-howlin' after deer
{114089}{114156}{y:i}Wasn't scared of jumpin'|{y:i}off the truck in high gear
{114161}{114223}{y:i}King went a-sniffin'|{y:i}and he would go
{114225}{114327}{y:i}Was the best old hound dog|{y:i}I ever did know
{114816}{114886}{y:i}That old King was a friend of mine
{114889}{114957}{y:i}Never knew a dog|{y:i}that was half as fine
{114959}{115021}{y:i}I may find one, you never do know
{115024}{115101}{y:i}'Cause I still got a long way to go
{115505}{115579}{y:i}I had a dog and his name was King
{115581}{115648}{y:i}I told the dog about everything
{115650}{115713}{y:i}Old King sure meant a lot to me
{115716}{115800}{y:i}But that hound dog is history
{117413}{117484}{y:i}King went a-howlin' after deer
{117487}{117552}{y:i}Wasn't scared of jumpin'|{y:i}off the truck in high gear
{117554}{117618}{y:i}King went a-sniffin'|{y:i}and he would go
{117621}{117705}{y:i}Was the best old hound dog|{y:i}I ever did know
{118251}{118305}Is there a guitar player in the house?
{118384}{118469}This song here,|I recorded here in Nashville...
{118532}{118593}and Nicolette Larson|sang this song with me.
{118598}{118657}I'd really like to do this one for her.
{118828}{118879}{y:i}Comes a time
{118917}{118978}{y:i}when you're driftin'
{118997}{119070}{y:i}Comes a time|{y:i}when you settle down
{119125}{119177}{y:i}Comes a light
{119196}{119250}{y:i}feelin's lifting
{119261}{119356}{y:i}Lift that baby|{y:i}right up off the ground
{119395}{119513}{y:i}Oh, this old world
{119519}{119575}{y:i}keeps spinning round
{119597}{119659}{y:i}It's a wonder tall trees
{119661}{119709}{y:i}ain't layin' down
{119740}{119799}{y:i}There comes a time
{119893}{119939}"You and I
{119973}{120014}{y:i}we were captured
{120041}{120131}{y:i}We took our souls|{y:i}and we flew away
{120181}{120293}{y:i}We were right|{y:i}we were giving
{120316}{120414}{y:i}That's how we kept|{y:i}what we gave away
{120460}{120570}{y:i}Oh, this old world
{120573}{120632}{y:i}keeps spinnin' round

{123085}{123154}This song here was written|by lan Tyson.
{123157}{123184}He's a Canadian.
{123186}{123261}He's living out in Calgary,|on his ranch, right now...
{123268}{123345}But when I was just a kid,|16 years or 17 years old...
{123348}{123441}I went to this place near Winnipeg|where I grew up...
{123444}{123491}and it's called Falcon Lake.
{123493}{123529}And it's just one of those first times...
{123532}{123602}when you really got away from home|and were on your own.
{123605}{123670}I was just kind of feeling it|for the first time.
{123675}{123723}And there was this little...
{123725}{123797}kind of a restaurant place|with a jukebox in it that was there...
{123799}{123845}and I used to go there.
{123847}{123896}And I think I spent all my money...
{123899}{123978}playing this next song|over and over again.
{123981}{124053}It was the most beautiful record|that I've ever heard in my life...
{124056}{124103}and I just could not get enough of it.
{124106}{124184}And so, I don't have the record|with me here...
{124189}{124288}but I'm gonna sing it with my friends,|and we'll see what we can do.
{124853}{124923}{y:i}Think I'll go out to Alberta
{124959}{125024}{y:i}Weather's good there in the fall
{125060}{125135}{y:i}I got some friends that I could go
{125153}{125205}{y:i}to working for
{125266}{125339}{y:i}Still I wish you'd change your mind
{125375}{125440}{y:i}If I ask you one more time
{125470}{125584}{y:i}But we've been through that|{y:i}a hundred times or more
{125670}{125743}{y:i}Four strong winds that blow Ionely
{125778}{125841}{y:i}Seven seas that run high
{125878}{125952}{y:i}All those things that don't change
{125981}{126031}{y:i}Come what may
{126090}{126177}{y:i}If the good times are all gone
{126192}{126256}{y:i}Then I'm bound for moving on
{126297}{126416}{y:i}I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way
{126505}{126584}{y:i}If I get there before the snow flies
{126615}{126681}{y:i}And if things are looking good
{126711}{126755}{y:i}You could meet me
{126757}{126825}{y:i}if I send you down the fare
{126913}{126995}{y:i}But by then it would be winter
{127011}{127093}{y:i}Not too much for you to do
{127124}{127200}{y:i}And those winds sure can blow cold
{127213}{127261}{y:i}way out there
{127325}{127415}{y:i}Four strong winds that blow Ionely
{127434}{127497}{y:i}Seven seas that run high
{127533}{127611}{y:i}All those things that don't change
{127635}{127688}{y:i}Come what may
{127738}{127811}{y:i}If the good times are all gone
{127847}{127913}{y:i}Then I'm bound for moving on
{127953}{128064}{y:i}I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way
{128557}{128647}{y:i}Still I wish you'd change your mind
{128664}{128748}{y:i}If I ask you one more time
{128782}{128901}{y:i}But we've been through that|{y:i}a hundred times or more
{128981}{129056}{y:i}Four strong winds that blow Ionely

{129282}{129331}{y:i}Come what may
{129397}{129468}{y:i}If the good times are all gone
{129508}{129574}{y:i}Then I'm bound for moving on
{129605}{129721}{y:i}I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way
{129818}{129935}{y:i}I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way
{130858}{130916}{y:i}One of these days
