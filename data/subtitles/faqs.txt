4
00:01:32,992 --> 00:01:35,859
Joey, eu preciso que você
ligue para o Stan.

5
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:38,055
Diga que eu preciso dele.
É uma emergência.

6
00:01:39,165 --> 00:01:40,359
Traga camisinhas.

7
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,567
Yeah.
It's ''Popping the Cherry''.

8
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:50,867
I'm at the Xanadu.

9
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:08,928
Want some dope?

10
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:11,163
What you got?

11
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:16,233
Tell me what you want.
I got it.

12
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,468
You wan t something
that gets you... horny?

13
00:02:23,576 --> 00:02:26,306
You know, all worked up
so you can really...

14
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:29,547
You know.

15
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:38,350
I'm fine, thanks.

16
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:40,958
Suit yourself, kid.

17
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,223
They told me it was a girl.

18
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:17,462
Hey, I gotta get this done,
this is important.

19
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:18,929
The other kid's in jail.

20
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,966
Well, I don't wanna do
any more boys.

21
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:22,967
It's bad for my image.

22
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:25,629
You wanna take it up?
That's what you wanna do?

23
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:27,330
Make me tell them
you wouldn't do it?

24
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:31,475
Hey, I'm not the problem.

25
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:33,045
Hey, you're becoming
the problem.

26
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:37,416
I don't want to do this fag
stuff any more than you do.

27
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,485
Hey, are we doing this or what?

28
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:46,049
I want my money.

29
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:50,961
Awe, fuck it.

30
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,589
Hey wait,
save it for the camera.

31
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:57,699
So what's the deal here?
Rape?

32
00:03:57,804 --> 00:03:58,896
He's my son?
What?

33
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:02,573
He's a kid who owes you
money and he can't pay you.

34
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:04,074
Oh, a punishment fuck.

35
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:06,503
That's not what you said.

36
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:08,911
I'm not doing that.
I want more money.

37
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:10,880
We've already negotiated
the cash, kid,

38
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:12,042
that's all you're getting.

39
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:13,482
Fine, I'm not doing it.

40
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:14,644
Stay there,
you little fuck.

41
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:15,482
Hey, fuck you.

42
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:17,821
Come on, you little bitch.

43
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:21,985
Christ.

44
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:26,898
There is no
punishment fucking,

45
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,298
or angry fucking or
anything like that.

46
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:31,165
Sex is supposed to be fun.

47
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,966
I only do fun sex.

48
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:36,902
I should beat the shit out
of that little faggot.

49
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:39,075
Forget it, man.
I'm walking.

50
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:40,577
Now, now listen kid.

51
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,082
Take it easy.

52
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,542
We'll raise you 50 percent.

53
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:47,675
Fine.

54
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:49,285
I'm gonna top.

55
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:50,720
No fucking way.

56
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:52,256
Just pretend you're a Marine.

57
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:54,087
Don't worry,
I won't kiss you.

58
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:56,821
Kid, you're too fucking
smart for your own good.

59
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,990
This isn't gonna
make the guys happy.

60
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:03,263
Who are these guys?

61
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:07,738
You know, the guys... the people
who run things like this.

62
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,400
Oh, the mob.
The mob is gonna get me.

63
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,602
Uh-huh.
Whatever.

64
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:12,871
Look, I'm not getting
under that thing.

65
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,970
Can you just sit on it?

66
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:16,742
Hey guys, I'm right here.
I'm not a thing.

67
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:19,077
As long as I'm not under him.

68
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:23,250
Christ. All right.
Stan, get on the bed.

69
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:24,846
Get your thing going.

70
00:05:24,957 --> 00:05:25,821
Get going!

71
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:27,426
Ready, kid?

72
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:28,585
Ready when he is.

73
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,297
I'm working on it.
I'm working on it.

74
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:35,863
Hmm.
Nice ass, fag boy.

75
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:47,443
We rented the room for
another hour sonny boy,

76
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:49,412
but you have to
get out after that.

77
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:53,149
Money's on the dresser.

78
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:56,522
I'm going home to
the wife and kids.

79
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,085
Later.

80
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,058
Nice fuck, by the way.

81
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:04,822
Yeah, that was nice, kid.
You're one hot faggot.

82
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:09,593
Don't call me that.

83
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:15,539
What do I call you?
Queer? Homo? Punk?

84
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:17,108
I never know what's
in at the moment.

85
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:19,973
Call me by my name.

86
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:27,075
Yeah, that's a good idea.

87
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:28,813
I don't even know your name.

88
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,756
Bye, Stan.

89
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:02,877
// Fashion Playhouse.
Give us poison. Make us... //

90
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:10,154
Yo.

91
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:12,925
What do you want?

92
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:14,864
I want a hamburger.

93
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:17,060
No, two hamburgers.
Lots of fries.

94
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,730
And, uh,
maybe even another hamburger.

95
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,003
How you want them?

96
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,604
Uh, I don't think I'll be
having any hamburgers.

97
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:32,382
Well, look, if you sit here,
you gotta eat.

98
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:34,953
That's the boss's policy.
He's a really evil son-of-a-bitch.

99
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:37,751
What's with the
newspaper clippings?

100
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:39,781
It's from a porn director.

101
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:43,089
-You just did a porn?
-That's me. Freshly fucked.

102
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,328
Please don't leak anything
on the seat.

103
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:47,126
I gotta clean it up later.

104
00:07:57,577 --> 00:07:58,566
You got a light?

105
00:07:58,678 --> 00:07:59,645
Don't smoke.

106
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:01,679
Fuck.
I wanna smoke so bad.

107
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:03,514
Hey, you pay Roland?

108
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:04,378
Huh?

109
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,115
This is Roland's territory.

110
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,586
You wanna cruise here,
you pay Roland.

111
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:14,353
Well, let's say I don't
pay this mysterious Roland.

112
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:17,395
You wind up shot dead
and tossed in a dumpster...

113
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,657
out near San Pedro.

114
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:20,322
That's what happens.

115
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:23,296
These tricks are mine.

116
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:25,097
Yeah, don't forget to
pay Roland his cut.

117
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:28,697
Hey, queers.

118
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:30,776
Oh, your price just
went up, jerk.

119
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:32,367
Turning you on just tripled.

120
00:08:32,478 --> 00:08:34,139
Queer, I'm gonna
turn you out.

121
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:35,805
We've got protection, jerk-off.

122
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:37,507
Move on, straight boys.

123
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,011
Fuck you, faggots.

124
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:42,053
Oh fuck you,
fuck you, fuck you.

125
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:44,179
All this fuck you sounds
like a come on to me.

126
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,155
Oh.
Queers, you're dead meat.

127
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:46,782
Yeah?

128
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:48,690
I know a particularly
lethal martial art.

129
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:50,827
Hey, you queers
are supposed to run.

130
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:51,328
Yeah.

131
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:03,133
You better get out of here.

132
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:04,266
-I'll go call Roland.
-You do that.

133
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,542
Get in the Jeep.
Go.

134
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:32,800
Well, well, well.

135
00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:51,720
Drop the crow bar, baby.

136
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:54,486
You ain't gonna shoot us.

137
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:03,734
Drop the crow bar, baby.

138
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,641
You bashers are
invariably attracted to...

139
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:15,311
the very thing
you're bashing.

140
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:17,781
Fuck.

141
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:20,215
Get down... on the pavement.

142
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:27,883
You okay?

143
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:30,053
They were gonna kill me.

144
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:32,153
You want me to
kill them?

145
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:33,231
Yes.

146
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:46,834
You got them?

147
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:47,708
Oh, yeah.

148
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,940
If they move, aim for the balls.

149
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:51,813
Where you going?

150
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:55,286
I've got a special trick.

151
00:10:56,322 --> 00:11:00,019
-I know how to make assholes cry.
-What you gonna do?

152
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:08,964
I'm gonna give you
something to remember us by.

153
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:15,064
Sort of like a kiss.
A real tough, kiss.

154
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:24,473
Fuck.

155
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,109
Shut up.

156
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:31,417
I am really tired of
all this... sordidness.

157
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,831
Now get up, boys.

158
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:51,902
-That's a nice coat.
-Thanks.

159
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:53,535
-Don't talk to them.
-Quit it.

160
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:55,443
Take it off
and shut up.

161
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:58,708
-I am not...
-Take it off...

162
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:00,376
and give it to my man here.

163
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:25,434
Now... get out of my sight.

164
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:40,819
What are you
doing on the street?

165
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:43,828
My Dad said he was
going to kill me.

166
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:47,865
So where you're from I guess
it's okay to kill people?

167
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:50,162
I'm from Colorado.

168
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:53,898
Oh, Republican. Yes, it's
okay to kill people there.

169
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,204
No smoking, bitch...
or whatever you are.

170
00:12:58,377 --> 00:12:59,810
My place is for
normal people.

171
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:01,311
Not for perverts like you.

172
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:07,051
And I don't want to hear anything
about the Republican Party.

173
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,281
Because they're the only
thing between what's right...

174
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:13,187
and the shithole you inhabit.

175
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:17,388
I want to go home,
so pay up and get out.

176
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:19,754
You want some
more coffee, kid?

177
00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:21,332
More coffee.

178
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:29,798
So... what brought you
to Hollywood?

179
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:32,305
I thought it would be warm.

180
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:34,444
Where you staying?

181
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,747
Under the Cahuenga overpass.

182
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:38,508
How long you been there?

183
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:41,044
About three weeks.

184
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,621
You done?

185
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:46,588
Done.

186
00:13:50,696 --> 00:13:52,220
Come and stay with me.

187
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,060
At least till
you get on your feet.

188
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,035
Pay up and get out.

189
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:07,570
She's got the money.

190
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,551
Hey, where you going?

191
00:14:15,654 --> 00:14:17,144
I'm talking to you, she-male.

192
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:05,163
What's that smell?

193
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:06,932
Well, you know what they say...

194
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:09,872
where there's smoke there's fire.

195
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:11,442
Ain't that right,
Herr Goering?

196
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:16,941
-You ready?
-Done.

197
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:20,582
Come on, sunshine.

198
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:26,619
That must be a big fire.

199
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:28,090
Probably.

200
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:30,423
Why, that restaurant
might even burn down.

201
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:41,733
Do you always carry a gun?

202
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,342
Only when I run into
straight people.

203
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:51,978
What's your name?

204
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:55,316
Destiny.

205
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:57,889
Hi, Destiny.
I'm India.

206
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:30,155
Now, I don't want
no drugs in my house.

207
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:33,622
No crystal.
You on crystal, you out...

208
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:35,887
and your clothes will be
following you out the window.

209
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:36,723
You got that?

210
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:39,324
Uh-huh.
Check.

211
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:41,126
And I recommend you take
self defense classes...

212
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:42,666
at the Gay and Lesbian Center.

213
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:45,328
You into Kung Fu,
we'll get you a Dojo.

214
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:47,970
But you got to be ready when
those straight people...

215
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:49,040
come looking for you.

216
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:56,312
Yes, Miss Destiny.
Check.

217
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:00,616
And one more thing, buster.

218
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:03,085
I don't care if you bring
back ten or twelve boys...

219
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,678
and have yourself an orgy...

220
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,186
but you ain't doing
it without a condom.

221
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:10,957
You hear me?

222
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:12,325
Okay.

223
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:13,523
Condoms.

224
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:15,398
Check.

225
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:24,836
You're the sweetest boy.

226
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:31,944
I just don't know what's
wrong with this world...

227
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,211
you out on the street.

228
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:38,390
I just don't know what's
wrong with straight people.

229
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:45,791
Okay, welcome to
The Ministry of Truth.

230
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:46,956
That's from Orwell.

231
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,261
We're far from 1984
now, honey.

232
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:51,495
This here is
The Ministry of Truth.

233
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:53,935
And I'm the Minister.
The Minister of truth.

234
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:59,471
You got to spend two hours
every day naked.

235
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:00,772
Naked. Nude.

236
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:03,473
We're proud of the bodies we got.

237
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,379
Okay.
Two hours, honey.

238
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:06,917
And do it while we're awake.

239
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:08,008
Yeah, well...

240
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,855
Sweety, what you got to be
embarrassed about?

241
00:18:10,956 --> 00:18:11,945
You're as cute as can be.

242
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:15,993
Well, we only got one bed.

243
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:19,591
But if you want to sleep on
the couch, it's okay...

244
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:22,428
but if you want to sleep
on a bed, this is it.

245
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:23,899
Towels and stuff
are in the bathroom.

246
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:25,765
Have yourself a nice bath...

247
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:27,964
and go to sleep.

248
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:31,135
I was on my way to see a friend,
honey, when I ran into you.

249
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:32,335
I'll see you later.

250
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:33,376
Thank you.

251
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:40,975
Oh, Lester will
be coming home soon.

252
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:42,747
Lester's another one of my orphans.

253
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:44,254
I want you two to
get along, you hear?

254
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,262
What the fuck?

255
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:52,787
Lester?

256
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:55,428
Who the fuck let
you in here, asshole?

257
00:18:56,835 --> 00:18:57,824
Destiny.

258
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:00,872
It's her place.

259
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:04,006
I'm India.

260
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:10,413
God, another cock.
Super. Super.

261
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:14,446
Nice to meet you.

262
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:16,350
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

263
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:27,262
That's my side.

264
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:28,298
Sorry.

265
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:38,843
You tell anybody I got tits,
you're dead meat, cock boy.

266
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:23,549
Hey dear, honey,
make mama some coffee.

267
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:25,680
Mama needs some coffee bad.

268
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:49,137
Mama needs some sugar
with her coffee too, baby.

269
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:08,831
I don't know why you
want to be a woman, Destiny.

270
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,232
You are one hot man.

271
00:21:11,336 --> 00:21:13,270
It's too early for all that.

272
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:15,067
All right, Stud.

273
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:18,968
I am seriously considering
you as the devil's spawn.

274
00:21:19,077 --> 00:21:19,941
Sorry.

275
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,275
What do you do, Destiny?

276
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:31,413
I'm a photographer of men,
in passionate positions.

277
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:35,124
What's that?

278
00:21:38,096 --> 00:21:39,358
I'm a porn director.

279
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:43,134
Oh.

280
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:46,000
Something wrong, India?

281
00:21:46,104 --> 00:21:48,504
Um, no, um...

282
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:50,373
Look, um...

283
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:53,136
You okay, India?

284
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:54,371
Uh, yeah, sure.

285
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:55,707
Thanks for the
dinner and the bath.

286
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,611
It was really great.
I needed that.

287
00:21:58,483 --> 00:21:59,882
I've got to go.

288
00:22:48,266 --> 00:22:49,733
You've been really good to me.

289
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:50,995
Well, I adopted you, baby.

290
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:53,464
Yeah, yeah,
that was great but...

291
00:22:54,673 --> 00:22:55,697
I've got to go now.

292
00:22:55,807 --> 00:22:57,035
Where you gotta go?

293
00:22:57,142 --> 00:22:58,837
You know, out.

294
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:00,738
What are you gonna do?

295
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:02,737
How you gonna make money?

296
00:23:04,683 --> 00:23:05,877
You gonna work at a coffee shop?

297
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:07,576
You need an address
and phone number for that.

298
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,453
You gonna sell your body?

299
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:12,022
Hmm.

300
00:23:13,358 --> 00:23:14,825
It's a tough world, baby.

301
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:26,967
I was in a porn last night
and they stiffed me.

302
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,403
So you think we're all like that?

303
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:30,907
-I don't know you.
-I saved your life.

304
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:32,943
-You want to use me.
-I want to help you.

305
00:23:33,044 --> 00:23:34,773
You're just like the others,
you're just like my father.

306
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,539
You're just like them all.

307
00:23:35,647 --> 00:23:36,306
India.

308
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:39,009
Don't call me that.
That's my name, mine.

309
00:23:39,117 --> 00:23:40,175
Okay.

310
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:41,217
Okay.

311
00:23:41,953 --> 00:23:43,079
You're a pornographer.

312
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:45,156
I photograph men in
moments of passion, yes.

313
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:46,246
You know this old guy...

314
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:47,848
smokes a cigar,
carries his own light kit,

315
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:49,517
he picked me up
on Hollywood boulevard.

316
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:50,993
Popping the Cherry?

317
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:54,822
Shit. He's been doing
that for 20 years.

318
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:57,297
He used me and
then he stiffed me.

319
00:23:57,402 --> 00:24:00,098
I sold my body to him, all I wanted
to do was eat a real meal.

320
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:04,768
I want to kill him.

321
00:24:07,312 --> 00:24:08,939
-And that'll make you feel better?
-Yeah.

322
00:24:14,686 --> 00:24:15,414
Let's go.

323
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:19,014
You want to kill him?

324
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:21,649
Yeah, I want to kill every
straight fucking asshole.

325
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:25,018
Let's go.

326
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:55,922
Vinnie, that you?
I'm in the bedroom.

327
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:05,662
Hey! Get...
Don't. Wait.

328
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:07,101
No. Wait. No.

329
00:25:08,139 --> 00:25:10,107
-You stiffed me.
-No. Kid, don't.

330
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:11,641
You thought you could
fuck me because I'm gay.

331
00:25:11,743 --> 00:25:12,505
Wait.

332
00:25:12,611 --> 00:25:14,169
Well, you're not fucking
with this queer anymore.

333
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:16,314
Kid.

334
00:25:16,414 --> 00:25:19,144
This is for you, for
stealing from me.

335
00:25:20,118 --> 00:25:21,346
Kid, no.

336
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:23,683
Kid, wait. No.

337
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:28,223
This is for you dad.

338
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:29,719
Mom.

339
00:25:57,923 --> 00:25:59,151
There are too many.

340
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,625
There are too many
straights, Destiny.

341
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:06,993
I couldn't get them all
even if I still wanted to.

342
00:26:07,098 --> 00:26:08,759
I can't get all the hatred.

343
00:26:12,504 --> 00:26:14,131
How do we deal
with all the hate?

344
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,866
I'm already tired of
dealing with the hate.

345
00:26:19,778 --> 00:26:21,006
Why do they hate us?

346
00:26:56,514 --> 00:26:58,072
I brought you
something to eat.

347
00:26:58,183 --> 00:26:59,081
If you're hungry.

348
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:01,942
That's cool.
I'm really hungry.

349
00:27:04,923 --> 00:27:06,288
You're a good bro, Lester.

350
00:27:07,225 --> 00:27:07,987
Ow!

351
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:10,761
Come on, that didn't
hurt, you wuss.

352
00:27:10,862 --> 00:27:12,261
Man, you're tough.

353
00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:14,332
I am tough.
I am one tough mutha-fucker.

354
00:27:14,432 --> 00:27:16,662
I'm not tough enough.
I need to be tougher.

355
00:27:16,768 --> 00:27:17,996
You're tough, man.

356
00:27:18,103 --> 00:27:20,663
It took balls to go and face
that fucking pornographer.

357
00:27:20,772 --> 00:27:21,500
Yeah?

358
00:27:21,606 --> 00:27:24,097
You didn't even think twice,
you just went for it.

359
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:26,177
Yeah, that's true.
I guess that's true.

360
00:27:27,712 --> 00:27:29,236
That's some tough shit.

361
00:27:29,347 --> 00:27:31,815
-Tough shit for him, huh?
-Hey, the fucker earned it.

362
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:34,346
I can't get rid of them all.

363
00:27:34,452 --> 00:27:38,320
Fuck the straights, India.
Look out for yourself.

364
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:42,619
I feel really good
with you and Destiny.

365
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:43,921
That's cause we're tough.

366
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:45,291
Nobody's tougher
than Destiny.

367
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:46,489
I'm second toughest.

368
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:48,498
-Yeah, that's true.
-Fuckin' ain't?

369
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,534
But I feel like you
like me, you know...

370
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:51,260
even though I'm a queer.

371
00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:53,496
Like, you're not going
to take advantage of me.

372
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:55,505
We like you because
you're a queer, dude...

373
00:27:55,607 --> 00:27:56,938
and you're tough.

374
00:27:57,042 --> 00:27:58,737
-Okey Dokey.
-Queen.

375
00:27:58,843 --> 00:27:59,901
-Bulldozer.
-Cocksucker.

376
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:01,808
I never understood why
straights call people...

377
00:28:01,913 --> 00:28:03,938
they don't like cocksuckers,
or say things suck.

378
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:05,448
Cocksucking is great.

379
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:08,644
That's cause they're
twisted fucks, you big homo.

380
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:15,216
I gotta get moving, um...

381
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:18,625
I'm getting a new job and
I need to find somebody...

382
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:20,425
to replace me at my current job.

383
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:23,763
-That's a lotta jobs.
-I gotta work, cockboy.

384
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:28,604
All you gotta do is
give out flyers...

385
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:30,971
outside bars in Santa Monica.

386
00:28:32,777 --> 00:28:33,744
The only bad thing
is the hours,

387
00:28:33,845 --> 00:28:36,006
it's like from 10 till 2 or 3.

388
00:28:36,781 --> 00:28:39,011
I'm not sponging
off Destiny for good.

389
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:40,846
I'm starting at a garage.

390
00:28:40,952 --> 00:28:43,318
I'm gonna be an auto-mechanic.

391
00:28:43,421 --> 00:28:44,319
For real?

392
00:28:44,422 --> 00:28:46,185
I feel so fucking lucky.

393
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:48,350
You can twist
my nuts anytime.

394
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:51,918
With a 10-foot
wrench maybe... yuck.

395
00:28:54,032 --> 00:28:56,227
-You want the job.
-Yeah, I want the job.

396
00:29:33,071 --> 00:29:33,833
Here's a flyer.

397
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:37,341
Hey.

398
00:29:41,146 --> 00:29:42,670
-Hey.
-Hey.

399
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:43,941
You got a place to stay?

400
00:29:44,048 --> 00:29:46,482
Maybe.
You got a place to stay?

401
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:49,476
-Yeah.
-Well, so do I.

402
00:29:49,587 --> 00:29:50,918
I don't have any
coffee though.

403
00:29:51,022 --> 00:29:52,717
Wanna buy me some coffee?

404
00:29:52,824 --> 00:29:54,291
-I'll buy you some coffee.
-All right.

405
00:29:54,392 --> 00:29:55,222
Let's go.

406
00:30:18,249 --> 00:30:25,155
// Welcome me home now,
see how weary I am. //

407
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:31,318
// Don 't you know
I've been down for a while, //

408
00:30:31,429 --> 00:30:36,799
// I need your smile...
at the light show. //

409
00:30:43,074 --> 00:30:44,974
// In Wonderland. //

410
00:31:12,103 --> 00:31:13,297
Don't let me bother you.

411
00:31:20,778 --> 00:31:22,370
You got condoms under there?

412
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:22,946
Uh-huh.

413
00:31:25,149 --> 00:31:26,047
Carry on.

414
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:33,987
She's like my Mom and
my sister. And my boyfriend.

415
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:35,923
That's cool.

416
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:38,962
-Your ass is hot.
-You haven't seen my ass yet.

417
00:31:51,175 --> 00:31:51,800
Hey.

418
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:13,488
Lester!

419
00:32:14,632 --> 00:32:18,124
Honey, make mama some coffee.
Mama needs some coffee bad.

420
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,575
We represent
everything they want.

421
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,147
-Right.
-No, really, think about it.

422
00:32:30,248 --> 00:32:32,512
We're fabulously attractive,
we have a lot of fun,

423
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:35,177
we go out with whoever we
want, and more importantly,

424
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:37,345
we do just exactly
what we want.

425
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:38,888
I mean, just look at Destiny.

426
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,981
You mean, because we don't
buy gender as destiny,

427
00:32:41,092 --> 00:32:44,255
and have lots of sex,
breeders get upset.

428
00:32:44,362 --> 00:32:45,989
If they could do that,
everything they...

429
00:32:46,097 --> 00:32:48,224
supposedly believe
in would fall apart.

430
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:52,394
Religion, work, all their
so-called culture, everything.

431
00:32:52,503 --> 00:32:54,494
So they try to get rid of us.

432
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:56,368
You and me and
beautiful here,

433
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:58,066
we expose their corruption.

434
00:32:58,176 --> 00:33:00,838
We are living proof
there's another way.

435
00:33:00,945 --> 00:33:02,412
-We're outlaws.
-Uh-huh.

436
00:33:02,513 --> 00:33:04,071
And we can cause the collapse
of the straight world.

437
00:33:04,182 --> 00:33:05,012
Say it, India.

438
00:33:05,783 --> 00:33:06,943
You know what they
do to outlaws?

439
00:33:07,051 --> 00:33:08,985
I saw Bonnie and Clyde.
I've been bashed.

440
00:33:10,421 --> 00:33:13,754
Collapse of the straight world.
That sounds like a good idea.

441
00:33:13,858 --> 00:33:14,688
Do you really think that?

442
00:33:14,792 --> 00:33:16,987
-Think about it.
-Okay. I will.

443
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:18,494
Is there a date
on this collapse?

444
00:33:18,596 --> 00:33:20,029
Destiny's working
on that one.

445
00:33:20,131 --> 00:33:21,792
Are you referring to that
unconditional love thing?

446
00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:23,423
It doesn't apply if
you're not one of them.

447
00:33:23,534 --> 00:33:26,128
And if you're not one of them,
it doesn't count.

448
00:33:26,237 --> 00:33:28,467
Blood doesn't count
if you're gay.

449
00:33:28,573 --> 00:33:30,507
Apparently not, baby.
Except for AIDS.

450
00:33:30,608 --> 00:33:31,768
Well, I love you both.

451
00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:36,508
-And a few others.
-A few thousand others.

452
00:33:36,614 --> 00:33:37,842
No, really.

453
00:33:41,886 --> 00:33:44,286
He's just got a whole
lotta love to give.

454
00:33:44,389 --> 00:33:45,981
-Whew!
-And I'm cute.

455
00:33:53,297 --> 00:33:54,264
No, really.

456
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:56,333
Honey, we gotta
get a bigger place...

457
00:33:56,434 --> 00:33:58,959
just to accomodate all your
boyfriends.

458
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,059
Ha ha.

459
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:02,002
But it's true though, we
all got thrown out for...

460
00:34:02,106 --> 00:34:03,266
not being like them.

461
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:04,841
I guess that's part of
our kind of growing up,

462
00:34:04,942 --> 00:34:07,240
you know, getting thrown
out by angry biologicals.

463
00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:09,836
And that's why I think creating our
own family structure is so important.

464
00:34:09,947 --> 00:34:12,745
-Hey, Dad, can I get twenty?
-Oh, God.

465
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:16,584
-Who would throw this one out?
-Somebody with no money.

466
00:34:16,687 --> 00:34:18,382
Honey, somebody
with no boudoir.

467
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:21,219
Cause this one needs the bedroom.

468
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:40,476
Great stencil.
What do you do?

469
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:41,977
Oh, I'm a bomber.

470
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,810
Cool.
You live around here?

471
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:48,875
For a few days.
I'm in town on business.

472
00:34:52,056 --> 00:34:53,353
Got a place to stay?

473
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:56,490
Lord.

474
00:35:09,207 --> 00:35:12,040
This is Spencer.
He's going shopping with us.

475
00:35:12,143 --> 00:35:13,633
Destiny. Lester.

476
00:35:13,744 --> 00:35:15,336
-This is your mom?
-Yup.

477
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:16,708
Yo, Ms. Cleaver.

478
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:20,910
-Son.
-Spencer.

479
00:35:21,018 --> 00:35:23,509
-You got a place to stay?
-You some kind of pervert?

480
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:25,179
Only the best kind, baby.

481
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:26,347
You can't whip
me or anything.

482
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:28,925
-I'm not getting in a sling.
-You do drugs?

483
00:35:29,026 --> 00:35:32,257
Well, I don't sniff or smoke anything
I can make in a suburban garage.

484
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:34,160
-Son!
-Mom!

485
00:35:34,265 --> 00:35:36,859
-Can I fuck my brother?
-Only in the best families.

486
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:38,765
Cool! I'm gonna get
fucked by my brother!

487
00:35:40,171 --> 00:35:42,230
Okay, I have got to get
to work and bring home the bacon...

488
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:44,205
for my evergrowing family.

489
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:46,606
Get yourself some school clothes.

490
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:50,775
Bye mom.

491
00:35:52,216 --> 00:35:55,049
Mom.
Child, I feel like Mrs. Brady.

492
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:56,848
So white and so suburban.

493
00:35:56,954 --> 00:35:58,649
I'm gonna have to get me
a pert blonde wig, honey.

494
00:35:58,756 --> 00:36:00,951
Cause I just feel
pert, pert, pert.

495
00:36:01,058 --> 00:36:02,616
Bye, kids.
I got to go.

496
00:36:17,909 --> 00:36:18,739
It's not fair.

497
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:20,208
You guys can take
your shirt off.

498
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:21,403
So can you.

499
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:22,342
Right.

500
00:36:25,816 --> 00:36:26,680
Here.

501
00:36:46,604 --> 00:36:48,333
-That was so cool.
-You're so cool.

502
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:50,805
Lester is one cool dude.

503
00:36:51,842 --> 00:36:52,672
Fucking faggots.

504
00:36:52,777 --> 00:36:55,746
He thinks I'm a boy.
I'm a working man.

505
00:36:55,846 --> 00:36:57,404
See you fags later.

506
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:00,508
What was that all about?

507
00:37:00,618 --> 00:37:02,347
Lester got a job
as an auto-mechanic.

508
00:37:18,536 --> 00:37:21,801
And Destiny's got this rule:
two hours of nudity a day.

509
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,498
-Yeah?
-Yeah

510
00:37:23,608 --> 00:37:24,575
Crazy.

511
00:37:24,675 --> 00:37:27,166
It's all about how we're
ashamed of our bodies.

512
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,478
-We're gonna do our two hours now.
-Okay.

513
00:40:18,315 --> 00:40:19,839
We've got to go
get ready for work.

514
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:21,941
Now?
I'm all ready...

515
00:40:22,052 --> 00:40:23,610
-Now.
-Dude.

516
00:40:23,721 --> 00:40:24,449
Up! Up!

517
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:42,803
Nice coat.

518
00:40:42,907 --> 00:40:45,432
Yeah, Destiny and I
took it from a basher.

519
00:40:45,543 --> 00:40:46,840
No shit.

520
00:40:48,212 --> 00:40:49,509
Yeah.
He was gonna fuck me up.

521
00:40:51,649 --> 00:40:52,741
Hey.
What's this?

522
00:40:55,252 --> 00:40:58,653
It's his address.
Let's go bash him.

523
00:40:58,756 --> 00:41:01,190
You know, Destiny thinks
bashers are closet queers.

524
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:02,884
Oh, Jesus was a closet queer.

525
00:41:07,398 --> 00:41:10,458
-Where you buy bullets at?
-Wal-Mart.

526
00:41:10,568 --> 00:41:14,698
-The prices good there?
-So far that's what I've found.

527
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:17,399
You gotta have a card,
and you gotta deal with...

528
00:41:17,508 --> 00:41:18,975
all those people
that go to Wal-Mart.

529
00:41:21,345 --> 00:41:23,779
I'm thinking of going
from a .38 to a .45.

530
00:41:23,881 --> 00:41:25,007
Oh.

531
00:41:25,115 --> 00:41:29,211
It's very visual...
and the feel is so nice.

532
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:32,915
Honey, a .45 with a chrome handle
and it is Dirty Harry time.

533
00:41:50,207 --> 00:41:51,697
Well, well, well.

534
00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:54,801
Hello, Destiny.
Matinee.

535
00:41:54,912 --> 00:41:56,470
Is this a social call?

536
00:41:56,580 --> 00:42:00,380
Well we've been hearing reports
about roving bands of drag queens...

537
00:42:00,484 --> 00:42:03,248
brandishing guns
in West Hollywood.

538
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:04,150
Ohh.

539
00:42:04,255 --> 00:42:06,223
A band of roving drag queens.

540
00:42:06,624 --> 00:42:07,921
Do you know anything about that?

541
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:10,493
That sounds like an urban
legend to me.

542
00:42:10,594 --> 00:42:13,290
Honey, all we care about
are wigs and make-up.

543
00:42:13,397 --> 00:42:15,228
And gowns and shit.

544
00:42:16,734 --> 00:42:18,759
We let bashers
beat up all over us.

545
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:21,030
That's what we do.

546
00:42:21,138 --> 00:42:23,663
That's what I told
the other detectives,

547
00:42:23,774 --> 00:42:26,004
but they're
interested anyway.

548
00:42:26,777 --> 00:42:29,507
Maybe they're
interested in payoffs.

549
00:42:29,613 --> 00:42:30,978
Possible.

550
00:42:31,081 --> 00:42:32,708
It's worth thinking about.

551
00:42:32,816 --> 00:42:35,512
Maybe they're interested in
killing some drag queens,

552
00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:38,110
and making them do some
Rodney King dance steps.

553
00:42:39,423 --> 00:42:42,654
Damone, why are you always
coming around here?

554
00:42:46,297 --> 00:42:48,026
Is this business or pleasure?

555
00:42:51,101 --> 00:42:53,092
Is there one of us
that you like?

556
00:42:53,203 --> 00:42:55,364
One of us that you prefer?

557
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:04,737
You on duty, officer Damone?

558
00:43:06,383 --> 00:43:07,441
Is this official?

559
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:11,016
No.

560
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:16,486
I know you're here
to warn me about cops.

561
00:43:18,395 --> 00:43:20,454
We already look
out for the cops.

562
00:43:20,564 --> 00:43:22,464
We look out for Christians.

563
00:43:22,566 --> 00:43:25,330
We look out for fucking rednecks.
We look out for everybody.

564
00:43:27,137 --> 00:43:30,300
That's what we do;
we look out.

565
00:43:33,844 --> 00:43:36,312
Hey, I'd like to take
some pictures of you guys.

566
00:43:36,413 --> 00:43:37,641
We want some coffee.

567
00:43:37,748 --> 00:43:39,875
Will you buy us some coffee
if we let you take pictures?

568
00:43:39,984 --> 00:43:41,178
Sure.

569
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:43,617
I want a Latte.
Nonfat.

570
00:43:43,721 --> 00:43:47,282
A Latte, nonfat.
I'm Land, by the way.

571
00:43:47,391 --> 00:43:48,483
-I'm India.
-Hey.

572
00:43:48,592 --> 00:43:49,422
Spencer.

573
00:44:16,887 --> 00:44:18,115
What's that scar on your leg?

574
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:21,587
Oh, my Dad hit me
with a golf club there.

575
00:44:21,692 --> 00:44:22,852
Oh.

576
00:44:23,794 --> 00:44:25,819
That one was two
weeks in the hospital.

577
00:44:28,932 --> 00:44:30,263
That one on your shoulder?

578
00:44:30,367 --> 00:44:32,733
I don't know,
I was real little.

579
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:35,396
Whatever it was,
it must have been really gay.

580
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:36,973
It looks like it hurt.

581
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:41,202
That one on your neck?

582
00:44:42,913 --> 00:44:45,381
Once, riding the school bus,

583
00:44:45,482 --> 00:44:48,508
I watched this kid
heat up his zippo lighter.

584
00:44:48,619 --> 00:44:51,144
I didn't know what he was doing
or who the fuck he was,

585
00:44:51,255 --> 00:44:54,190
he knew I was queer.

586
00:44:54,291 --> 00:44:56,782
Anyway, he heated it up
really hot and grabbed me,

587
00:44:56,894 --> 00:44:58,657
he held it against my neck.

588
00:45:00,064 --> 00:45:02,726
I was just sitting there,
I wasn't prepared for that one...

589
00:45:02,833 --> 00:45:05,825
but because I was gay,
I was a fair target.

590
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:09,267
That burned the
fuck out of me.

591
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:13,742
I tried to beat him up later, but
he was like four grades ahead of me.

592
00:45:13,844 --> 00:45:14,868
Twice as big.

593
00:45:17,648 --> 00:45:18,945
That's a lot of scars.

594
00:45:21,518 --> 00:45:23,645
Even when I was a
little kid, Mom and Pop,

595
00:45:23,754 --> 00:45:25,016
they'd just hit me.

596
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:29,048
Sometimes they'd tell me
it was for my own good,

597
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:32,356
how it hurt them...
and sometimes they'd just hit me.

598
00:45:32,463 --> 00:45:34,226
I was too little
to understand.

599
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,825
I never knew when they
were going to strike.

600
00:45:38,936 --> 00:45:41,598
These kids pushed me
under a moving car once.

601
00:45:43,273 --> 00:45:46,367
In junior high school,
that's when, that's when...

602
00:45:48,512 --> 00:45:49,570
that's when...

603
00:45:56,453 --> 00:45:58,444
It's okay, I don't
let anyone in anymore.

604
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:00,857
Ever?

605
00:46:02,526 --> 00:46:03,891
Not really.

606
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:06,156
Maybe you will some day.

607
00:46:07,698 --> 00:46:09,165
Maybe one day you will.

608
00:46:10,901 --> 00:46:12,459
Maybe I don't want to.

609
00:46:12,569 --> 00:46:15,367
Feelings just cause you pain.
It's better not to feel.

610
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:23,037
We'll protect you
from the straights.

611
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:57,508
C'mon.

612
00:47:01,251 --> 00:47:02,718
What did we do
with the keys.

613
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:03,912
They're in my bag.

614
00:47:11,695 --> 00:47:12,923
What the hell is this?

615
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:14,429
Oh, it's a detonator.

616
00:47:15,766 --> 00:47:17,631
-For a bomb.
-For straights.

617
00:47:20,537 --> 00:47:23,028
It's just a little one.
It's for my parents.

618
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:26,598
-They're in town on a convention.
-Spencer, you can't make bombs.

619
00:47:27,411 --> 00:47:30,005
It's so straight. It's weird redneck
stuff from back in the woods.

620
00:47:30,113 --> 00:47:32,604
They can beat and maime me
and I can't do anything?

621
00:47:33,483 --> 00:47:34,916
Look at me.
Look at me.

622
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:38,282
I really like you.

623
00:47:39,556 --> 00:47:40,682
Yeah, it's good.

624
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:43,383
I'd really like if
you'd stick around.

625
00:47:45,295 --> 00:47:48,662
-Yeah, okay.
-I'm pushing too hard.

626
00:47:53,637 --> 00:47:55,002
Let's go save a queer.

627
00:47:55,472 --> 00:47:56,063
Come on.

628
00:48:04,348 --> 00:48:05,406
No bombs.

629
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:44,719
That's his address.
Up the street there.

630
00:48:45,322 --> 00:48:47,153
This place is awful.
It's scary.

631
00:48:47,691 --> 00:48:50,854
Yeah. No wonder the
guy's fucked up.

632
00:48:50,961 --> 00:48:54,192
-What's the plan, Stan?
-Why Stan?

633
00:48:54,965 --> 00:48:56,489
It's just a rhyme.
Relax.

634
00:48:58,335 --> 00:48:59,700
Plan.
I don't know.

635
00:48:59,803 --> 00:49:00,997
I guess I just thought
something would come up...

636
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:03,095
as soon as we found the place.

637
00:49:03,206 --> 00:49:05,572
Stan's one of the guys
in that porn ring.

638
00:49:05,676 --> 00:49:07,200
Sorry.

639
00:49:08,879 --> 00:49:11,006
What if his buddy finds us first?

640
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:12,741
What if Destiny's
theory is cracked?

641
00:49:12,849 --> 00:49:14,214
And he's not one of us?

642
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:16,149
Or if he's so self-hating
he can't deal?

643
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:18,944
Maybe we better
get out of here.

644
00:49:19,056 --> 00:49:20,421
Until we get a plan.

645
00:49:22,592 --> 00:49:24,457
Just being me's bad enough.

646
00:49:24,561 --> 00:49:27,428
This is straight redneck country.
I don't want to start a war.

647
00:49:27,531 --> 00:49:29,624
Hey man, the trees
aren't too big, relax.

648
00:49:29,733 --> 00:49:32,031
They can string you up
from telephone poles too.

649
00:49:33,937 --> 00:49:35,063
Hey.

650
00:49:35,172 --> 00:49:38,141
Do you think it's self-hating if
I say I thought he was kind of cute?

651
00:49:38,241 --> 00:49:40,368
-It all depends.
-On what?

652
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:43,344
Whether you feel that way after
he puts you in the hospital.

653
00:49:45,048 --> 00:49:47,209
I think plenty of gay
guys are cute too. You know?

654
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:49,911
Like you.
You're really cute.

655
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:54,514
I'm not cute. I'm hot.
I'm transgressive.

656
00:49:54,624 --> 00:49:56,615
I'm into fucking my brother.

657
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:05,227
Fuck! He's coming
the other way, bro.

658
00:50:11,408 --> 00:50:12,568
He's hot.

659
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:15,076
Yeah, but I'm hot
and I'm available.

660
00:50:17,447 --> 00:50:18,505
What the fuck?

661
00:50:24,221 --> 00:50:25,051
Hey!

662
00:50:32,963 --> 00:50:34,089
This is yours.

663
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:38,231
Thanks for letting
me borrow it.

664
00:51:13,003 --> 00:51:15,836
-Thanks.
-You okay?

665
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:18,635
Yeah.

666
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:21,476
Will you meet me around the corner.

667
00:51:22,779 --> 00:51:23,711
Yeah.

668
00:51:26,149 --> 00:51:26,877
Thanks.

669
00:51:48,338 --> 00:51:50,533
-What was that about?
-He said to meet him at the corner.

670
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:53,438
-We're not going.
-Yes, we are.

671
00:51:53,543 --> 00:51:55,033
He's just calling his thugs.

672
00:51:55,145 --> 00:51:56,806
Okay, we'll park
so we can take off.

673
00:52:00,217 --> 00:52:01,377
That's a gun.

674
00:52:01,485 --> 00:52:03,953
I wouldn't be alive if
I trusted these people.

675
00:52:04,054 --> 00:52:06,921
Spence, we're gonna save him,
not kill him.

676
00:52:07,023 --> 00:52:09,321
I'm not gonna
let him hurt you.

677
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:12,658
Fine. I'm gonna save
my gay brother.

678
00:52:12,762 --> 00:52:14,059
You're gonna get hurt.

679
00:52:14,164 --> 00:52:15,756
You don't know
straights like I do.

680
00:52:15,866 --> 00:52:16,833
He's not straight.

681
00:52:17,868 --> 00:52:18,766
You have enough boys.

682
00:52:18,869 --> 00:52:21,030
You have every man and
boy in West Hollywood.

683
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:22,196
We're helping him.

684
00:52:24,441 --> 00:52:25,635
You just want to
fuck a straight.

685
00:52:25,742 --> 00:52:27,300
Look, I told you,
he's not straight.

686
00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:29,071
Look, I'm just gonna take this
till we get home.

687
00:52:32,716 --> 00:52:33,808
I hope you're right.

688
00:52:35,519 --> 00:52:36,508
I've got you to fuck.

689
00:52:56,473 --> 00:52:59,636
-So it's true.
-Yeah, I guess it is.

690
00:53:01,978 --> 00:53:04,412
Give it up, man.
Give it up.

691
00:53:05,916 --> 00:53:06,974
It's great that
you're so nice to me...

692
00:53:07,083 --> 00:53:08,880
but you don't understand
this neighborhood.

693
00:53:08,985 --> 00:53:10,009
I don't know how to act.

694
00:53:11,788 --> 00:53:12,880
Just do what you want.

695
00:53:14,958 --> 00:53:16,016
Yeah?

696
00:53:17,928 --> 00:53:18,860
Yeah.

697
00:53:38,848 --> 00:53:41,476
-I guess I really am gay.
-Yeah, I guess you are.

698
00:54:01,538 --> 00:54:05,474
Oh.
That feels good.

699
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:07,668
Hey, I finally got
the fucking motor started.

700
00:54:07,777 --> 00:54:09,074
It was the ignition,
wasn't it?

701
00:54:09,179 --> 00:54:10,806
Yup.
Doing laundry?

702
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:12,142
What the hell?

703
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:13,079
This is clean.

704
00:54:14,217 --> 00:54:16,515
What are you folding shit for?

705
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:18,087
I'm moving.

706
00:54:18,188 --> 00:54:19,621
Where the fuck you going?

707
00:54:19,723 --> 00:54:20,747
Hollywood.

708
00:54:22,125 --> 00:54:23,149
Hollywood?

709
00:54:27,864 --> 00:54:29,729
Yeah.
West Hollywood.

710
00:54:32,369 --> 00:54:34,599
Guy, fags live in West
fucking Hollywood.

711
00:54:35,705 --> 00:54:36,637
I know.

712
00:54:51,655 --> 00:54:57,890
Look, Guy, I won't tell anyone
you're a fag if you stay.

713
00:55:04,668 --> 00:55:05,896
You can come live with me.

714
00:55:06,002 --> 00:55:09,028
What the fuck!
I'm not a fucking fag.

715
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:11,107
-Okay, okay.
-You're saying I'm a fag.

716
00:55:12,275 --> 00:55:14,140
I'm saying you could
come live with me.

717
00:55:14,244 --> 00:55:15,233
Fuck you.

718
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:18,472
Is that what you want?

719
00:55:19,749 --> 00:55:21,046
What?

720
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:22,379
You want to fuck me?

721
00:55:25,689 --> 00:55:26,621
What the fuck?

722
00:55:50,747 --> 00:55:51,645
Fuck this.

723
00:55:52,716 --> 00:55:54,411
Come on. Come on,
fight back, you fag.

724
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:55,279
Fight back.

725
00:55:55,385 --> 00:55:56,181
Come on.

726
00:55:56,286 --> 00:55:59,449
You love me and...
I love you.

727
00:55:59,556 --> 00:56:02,116
Fuck, we're just two
guys who love each other.

728
00:56:02,225 --> 00:56:03,351
Deal with it, Q.

729
00:56:05,929 --> 00:56:06,691
Fuck.

730
00:56:37,093 --> 00:56:39,653
I told you to clean
the fucking kitchen up.

731
00:56:39,763 --> 00:56:41,890
You do what I
say around here.

732
00:56:41,998 --> 00:56:43,260
Get in there and clean that fucking...

733
00:56:43,366 --> 00:56:45,266
What the fuck are you
doing with my gun?

734
00:56:48,271 --> 00:56:49,966
You trying to kill yourself?

735
00:56:51,174 --> 00:56:52,573
Christ, if mom were here...

736
00:56:57,614 --> 00:57:00,412
What, the baby's gonna cry again?

737
00:57:00,517 --> 00:57:02,075
Baah, baah.

738
00:57:02,185 --> 00:57:03,709
When the fuck you
gonna grow up?

739
00:57:04,721 --> 00:57:06,348
Fuck... you.

740
00:57:06,489 --> 00:57:09,253
What? What was that,
you fucking pussy?

741
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:10,917
Fuck you, Daryl.

742
00:57:11,027 --> 00:57:13,996
What the fuck you
talking about? Fuck you.

743
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:16,861
Fuck you, kid, fuck you!

744
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:20,601
You are not a man. You're not
going to make it out there.

745
00:57:21,504 --> 00:57:23,734
These fucking pricks'll
eat you alive.

746
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:26,866
Don't come sniveling
back to me.

747
00:57:32,048 --> 00:57:33,777
Yeah.
Come on, shoot me.

748
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:37,143
I'm a homo... big man.

749
00:57:37,253 --> 00:57:38,481
Your little brother is a fag.

750
00:57:38,588 --> 00:57:40,055
Your little brother's
a cocksucking queer.

751
00:57:40,156 --> 00:57:41,714
What the fuck you
talking about, stupid?

752
00:57:41,825 --> 00:57:44,589
Your little brother is a
cocksucking queer.

753
00:57:44,694 --> 00:57:47,026
Go ahead, shoot your
brother, asshole.

754
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:48,688
Get away!
Get the fuck away from me.

755
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:50,527
Come on!
Come on, man!

756
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:51,930
Shoot the fag!

757
00:58:13,389 --> 00:58:15,755
Take the fucking gun
and shoot yourself, you faggot.

758
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:17,687
Don't come back here.

759
00:58:31,875 --> 00:58:34,810
I am going to be disbarred
from the drag queen union.

760
00:58:36,813 --> 00:58:38,804
I'm going to have to run around
with you in shame...

761
00:58:38,915 --> 00:58:40,212
wearing sunglasses.

762
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:43,978
I can't believe
I'm in love with a cop.

763
00:58:44,087 --> 00:58:45,111
The man.

764
00:58:48,992 --> 00:58:50,926
Well, the man is in love
with you too, baby.

765
00:58:52,228 --> 00:58:56,062
Why officer Damone,
you say the damnedest things.

766
00:59:02,005 --> 00:59:03,404
My mom loved the Vic.

767
00:59:03,506 --> 00:59:04,734
Victor Damone.

768
00:59:08,845 --> 00:59:10,403
What do you think
the kids are gonna say?

769
00:59:12,115 --> 00:59:15,983
Well, we're all family.
We are there for each other.

770
00:59:16,085 --> 00:59:18,519
We're there for you too.

771
00:59:23,426 --> 00:59:24,552
You'd better get to work.

772
00:59:25,595 --> 00:59:26,789
I'm not going to work.

773
00:59:31,801 --> 00:59:34,099
Baby, they're gonna think
you're in the hospital.

774
00:59:35,104 --> 00:59:35,695
Freak.

775
00:59:35,805 --> 00:59:36,635
You should talk, freak.

776
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:38,730
-You're the freak.
-You're the freak.

777
00:59:38,841 --> 00:59:39,739
You're the freak.

778
00:59:39,842 --> 00:59:40,604
Freak.

779
00:59:55,658 --> 00:59:56,852
Go to work.

780
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:59,121
I'll be here
when you get off.

781
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:06,260
// Turn off the lights and
tell me that you need me. //

782
01:00:06,369 --> 01:00:09,065
// Turn me on.
I'm Hollywood electric. //

783
01:00:11,741 --> 01:00:15,541
// Be my slave. Worship me.
You're nothing. //

784
01:00:15,645 --> 01:00:18,307
// Kiss my feet.
Be my slave... //

785
01:00:18,414 --> 01:00:20,905
// Worship me.
You're nothing. //

786
01:00:21,017 --> 01:00:23,577
// Kiss my feet.
Be my slave... //

787
01:00:23,686 --> 01:00:26,246
// Worship me.
You're nothing. //

788
01:00:26,356 --> 01:00:28,984
// Kiss my feet.
Be my slave... //

789
01:00:29,092 --> 01:00:31,686
// Worship me.
You're nothing. //

790
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:33,125
// Kiss my feet. //

791
01:00:33,229 --> 01:00:34,287
// Queen of the world. //

792
01:00:34,397 --> 01:00:35,557
// Queen of the world. //

793
01:00:35,665 --> 01:00:39,066
// Queen of the world... //

794
01:00:50,613 --> 01:00:52,911
Am I high or am I
seeing threes?

795
01:00:53,016 --> 01:00:55,109
What was that that just
came out of here?

796
01:00:55,218 --> 01:00:57,743
Honey, I have been
arrested by love.

797
01:00:57,854 --> 01:00:59,082
Uh-huh.

798
01:00:59,188 --> 01:01:02,123
-Mentally arrested.
-Don't be judgmental, India.

799
01:01:02,225 --> 01:01:04,785
It's a good thing Lester's not here.
Lester hates cops.

800
01:01:04,894 --> 01:01:06,828
He's not a real cop.
He's a gay cop.

801
01:01:06,929 --> 01:01:08,055
Uh-huh.

802
01:01:08,164 --> 01:01:11,099
-He pulled a gun on us.
-He was just playing with you boys.

803
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:13,065
Everybody wants to
play with you boys.

804
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:16,134
Who are all you boys anyway?

805
01:01:16,239 --> 01:01:18,139
This is Guy.
Destiny. Guy.

806
01:01:18,241 --> 01:01:19,731
Hey, Miss Destiny.

807
01:01:19,842 --> 01:01:21,833
Where'd you pick up
this youngster?

808
01:01:21,944 --> 01:01:24,139
You should remember him.
He tried to kill us.

809
01:01:24,247 --> 01:01:24,906
What?

810
01:01:25,014 --> 01:01:26,982
He's one of the bashers
from the night you met me.

811
01:01:29,085 --> 01:01:30,245
What the hell
is he doing here?

812
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:31,752
You said most bashers are gay.

813
01:01:31,854 --> 01:01:34,084
Oh, no, no, no, no.
They're violent bastards.

814
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:40,390
That's right. Go.

815
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:46,397
Destiny, you can't
throw him out.

816
01:01:46,502 --> 01:01:47,594
You take gay kids in.

817
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:49,604
I sure as hell can throw out
this attempted murderer.

818
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:52,675
I'm not interested in
a new Minister of Murder.

819
01:01:54,043 --> 01:01:56,341
It's all right, India.
I'll go.

820
01:02:08,925 --> 01:02:10,825
If he goes... I go.

821
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:18,959
-What's with the cop, Destiny?
-He's not like the others.

822
01:02:19,068 --> 01:02:19,625
Yeah?

823
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:20,703
We're just supposed to take
your word for it?

824
01:02:20,803 --> 01:02:21,428
That's right.

825
01:02:21,537 --> 01:02:22,970
Well, that's how
we feel about Guy.

826
01:02:23,072 --> 01:02:24,369
He's not like the others.

827
01:02:24,474 --> 01:02:25,702
It's not the same.

828
01:02:26,609 --> 01:02:27,667
He's a killer.

829
01:02:27,777 --> 01:02:28,675
And cops aren't?

830
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:31,342
I've been thrown out
a window or two.

831
01:02:31,447 --> 01:02:33,438
You want to tell me
cops aren't violent?

832
01:02:33,549 --> 01:02:35,915
You wanna tell me about cops?
Go ahead, tell me about cops!

833
01:02:36,018 --> 01:02:38,452
This one tried to
kill India and myself...

834
01:02:38,554 --> 01:02:41,022
and if not for Ms .45,
we would both be dead.

835
01:02:41,124 --> 01:02:42,591
Then I guess we
have a stalemate.

836
01:02:42,692 --> 01:02:44,319
Our friend versus your cop.

837
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:45,724
He pointed his gun at us
on the way out the door.

838
01:02:45,828 --> 01:02:47,796
-What?
-Ask him.

839
01:02:47,997 --> 01:02:52,263
For what it's worth, I
didn't want to hurt you guys.

840
01:02:52,368 --> 01:02:55,303
I was just so...
Quentin means so much to me.

841
01:02:55,404 --> 01:02:57,235
I'd do whatever he told me to do.

842
01:02:58,608 --> 01:02:59,802
This is all wrong.

843
01:02:59,909 --> 01:03:01,809
This fighting, the arguing,
the yelling.

844
01:03:01,911 --> 01:03:05,108
That's what I got away from.
This is my fault.

845
01:03:07,817 --> 01:03:08,943
I'm sorry.

846
01:03:09,051 --> 01:03:10,177
This is my fault.

847
01:03:13,656 --> 01:03:14,884
It's not his fault.

848
01:03:14,991 --> 01:03:15,787
It's not your fault.

849
01:03:15,892 --> 01:03:17,154
This has nothing to do with you.

850
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:21,026
-You went and got him?
-He had his address in his coat.

851
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:22,119
It was his nice coat.

852
01:03:24,066 --> 01:03:26,432
He wore his nice coat
to go gay-bashing.

853
01:04:02,305 --> 01:04:05,672
Saving people is
what you're all about.

854
01:04:05,775 --> 01:04:08,209
You can't throw a
lost gay guy out.

855
01:04:09,779 --> 01:04:11,406
He can be on probation.

856
01:04:11,514 --> 01:04:14,142
Destiny's cop can be
his probation officer.

857
01:04:21,958 --> 01:04:24,119
Yeah, we'll watch over them both.

858
01:04:26,262 --> 01:04:26,853
Go get him.

859
01:04:27,897 --> 01:04:28,591
Guy.

860
01:04:56,792 --> 01:04:57,884
He's not here.

861
01:04:59,095 --> 01:04:59,925
Come on, Spence.

862
01:05:05,167 --> 01:05:05,895
Guy!

863
01:05:06,569 --> 01:05:07,058
Guy!

864
01:05:15,044 --> 01:05:21,472
// Hmmm, hmmmm.
Hmmm, hmmmm. //

865
01:05:23,552 --> 01:05:25,747
You can't stop me from being gay.

866
01:05:25,855 --> 01:05:27,550
You do understand that,
don't you?

867
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:33,221
Why's the front
door wide open?

868
01:05:33,329 --> 01:05:35,820
Am I the only person worried
about crime around here?

869
01:05:38,134 --> 01:05:39,362
God.

870
01:05:39,468 --> 01:05:41,663
Another cock?

871
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:43,068
Fuck.

872
01:05:43,172 --> 01:05:44,867
This one tried to kill me.

873
01:05:44,974 --> 01:05:46,100
Fuck!

874
01:05:46,208 --> 01:05:48,768
It was a while back.
I didn't mean anything by it.

875
01:05:51,948 --> 01:05:52,846
Hey, Killer.

876
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:54,712
You're not gonna try to
mess us up, are you?

877
01:05:54,817 --> 01:05:56,216
I'll have to fuck you up.

878
01:05:56,319 --> 01:05:57,616
Naah.

879
01:05:57,720 --> 01:05:59,244
Killer.
I'm watching you.

880
01:06:00,523 --> 01:06:01,490
Go ahead.
Watch me.

881
01:06:01,590 --> 01:06:02,989
Just let me be myself.

882
01:06:05,194 --> 01:06:06,627
Okay, Killer.

883
01:06:08,030 --> 01:06:09,395
Hand me a towel, Killer.

884
01:06:13,869 --> 01:06:16,303
I really am sorry for
trying to kill you.

885
01:06:34,757 --> 01:06:36,520
I couldn't find him.

886
01:06:36,625 --> 01:06:38,456
We lost him.

887
01:06:39,795 --> 01:06:41,023
Killer's in here.

888
01:06:43,966 --> 01:06:45,399
-I named him.
-Uh oh.

889
01:06:45,501 --> 01:06:47,833
Killer.
Can I keep him?

890
01:06:47,937 --> 01:06:50,167
-Only if you take care of him.
-I promise.

891
01:06:50,272 --> 01:06:52,604
I'll feed him and
clean up after him.

892
01:06:53,476 --> 01:06:55,910
Well, maybe not
the clean up part.

893
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:57,036
Then you can keep him.

894
01:06:57,146 --> 01:07:00,513
Killer, here killer.
You can stay.

895
01:07:00,616 --> 01:07:01,640
Thanks, Lester.

896
01:07:17,266 --> 01:07:18,631
Do it.
C'mon.

897
01:07:18,734 --> 01:07:22,067
-What are you doing?
-Don't ask.

898
01:07:22,171 --> 01:07:24,696
You're just lucky I haven't
started field testing.

899
01:07:25,274 --> 01:07:27,504
-Come on, do it.
-I can't.

900
01:07:28,944 --> 01:07:30,536
This one's for you, Guy.

901
01:07:35,518 --> 01:07:36,780
This one's for you, faggots.

902
01:07:41,490 --> 01:07:44,050
Hey, Quen?
You there? Pick up, man.

903
01:07:45,194 --> 01:07:48,186
Come on, Q.
I don't like the way we left it.

904
01:07:48,297 --> 01:07:50,128
And I'd really like to see you.

905
01:08:03,779 --> 01:08:05,041
I really need to talk to you.

906
01:08:06,582 --> 01:08:08,948
I know you're not working at
the shop this afternoon, so...

907
01:08:11,187 --> 01:08:13,121
Tell him where we are...
so you can talk in person.

908
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:15,913
What?

909
01:08:16,025 --> 01:08:18,084
Give him the address
so he can see you.

910
01:08:19,562 --> 01:08:21,223
Okay. I'm staying
with these guys...

911
01:08:21,330 --> 01:08:25,130
at 1414 Haven Street,
right off Santa Monica.

912
01:08:25,234 --> 01:08:26,667
I'd really like
to see you, man.

913
01:08:26,769 --> 01:08:28,760
I miss you a lot already, Q.

914
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:38,205
-You faggot, get the fuck down!
-Ow!

915
01:08:38,314 --> 01:08:40,441
Fuck you, huh?
Fuck you!

916
01:08:40,549 --> 01:08:42,915
I'm gonna fucking kill you,
you fucker!

917
01:08:46,155 --> 01:08:46,985
Drop the bat.

918
01:08:56,732 --> 01:08:57,460
Fuck you.

919
01:09:11,180 --> 01:09:14,672
My parents threw me out when
I was 13 because I was a lesbian.

920
01:09:14,783 --> 01:09:16,410
Hell, I didn't even
know I was a lesbian...

921
01:09:16,518 --> 01:09:18,008
but they threw me out anyways.

922
01:09:19,755 --> 01:09:23,282
They were Christians and the
Bible told them to throw me out.

923
01:09:25,928 --> 01:09:27,259
Destiny saved my life.

924
01:09:28,564 --> 01:09:31,055
Got me back everything the
straights ever took away.

925
01:09:35,337 --> 01:09:36,235
God.

926
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:39,264
No, Destiny.

927
01:10:11,507 --> 01:10:12,838
You going with us?

928
01:10:12,941 --> 01:10:16,035
And watch you touch each other
all day? No, thanks.

929
01:10:18,580 --> 01:10:20,775
I'm meeting this
cool girl for coffee.

930
01:10:22,451 --> 01:10:23,440
Later, Spence.

931
01:10:24,219 --> 01:10:25,777
Later, cockboy.

932
01:10:28,957 --> 01:10:31,391
-Hey Spence!
-Yeah.

933
01:10:31,493 --> 01:10:33,927
I really like you.
I think you're cool.

934
01:10:34,029 --> 01:10:35,087
Okay.

935
01:10:35,197 --> 01:10:36,824
I just wanted you
to know that.

936
01:10:36,932 --> 01:10:38,559
Okay.
Thanks.

937
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:43,504
Laundry day's got you all giddy.

938
01:10:43,605 --> 01:10:45,300
Being with you
makes me giddy.

939
01:10:45,407 --> 01:10:48,001
Hey, what do you wanna do
tonight after we're done?

940
01:10:48,110 --> 01:10:52,410
Well, I'm not gonna hang out.
I'm going to the convention center...

941
01:10:52,514 --> 01:10:55,005
and see my parents, you know...

942
01:10:59,121 --> 01:10:59,985
Oh.

943
01:11:03,659 --> 01:11:05,559
I don't want you to go.

944
01:11:05,661 --> 01:11:06,889
Well, it will only be
a couple minutes.

945
01:11:07,429 --> 01:11:09,624
I'm not coming back after that,
Spence.

946
01:11:09,731 --> 01:11:11,358
I don't want you to leave.

947
01:11:37,059 --> 01:11:38,458
Hi, babe.

948
01:11:43,532 --> 01:11:44,658
How's that kid doing?

949
01:11:46,735 --> 01:11:47,827
Not too good.

950
01:11:53,408 --> 01:11:54,340
Damone...

951
01:11:56,478 --> 01:11:58,537
You gotta be careful around my kids.

952
01:12:00,349 --> 01:12:03,876
They got guns pointed at them
and us and me every day.

953
01:12:06,255 --> 01:12:10,191
They all got police stories...
and they're not fairy tales.

954
01:12:12,094 --> 01:12:13,356
I don't know.

955
01:12:15,731 --> 01:12:19,132
Maybe queer fairy tales are
about evil cops and bashers.

956
01:12:23,972 --> 01:12:25,098
I don't see it that way.

957
01:12:26,775 --> 01:12:27,799
That's how it is.

958
01:12:29,845 --> 01:12:32,313
-I'm sorry.
-We can talk about that.

959
01:12:39,321 --> 01:12:40,219
You ashamed?

960
01:12:41,723 --> 01:12:42,621
No.

961
01:12:44,459 --> 01:12:46,154
-I love you.
-I love you too, Victor Damone.

962
01:13:20,329 --> 01:13:21,057
Lips.

963
01:13:25,567 --> 01:13:26,363
Lips.

964
01:13:35,978 --> 01:13:36,740
Ears.

965
01:13:43,719 --> 01:13:44,515
Ears.

966
01:13:51,526 --> 01:13:52,686
Nipples.

967
01:14:18,820 --> 01:14:20,014
-Ass.
-Ass.

968
01:14:23,792 --> 01:14:25,225
That's enough.
Stop right there.

969
01:14:25,327 --> 01:14:26,294
Guy, get your shirt.

970
01:14:26,762 --> 01:14:27,558
Don't move, queer.

971
01:14:32,067 --> 01:14:33,034
I'm not going back.

972
01:14:35,003 --> 01:14:38,131
Then I'm killing you.
Straight or dead.

973
01:14:39,274 --> 01:14:40,798
It's for your own good, man.

974
01:14:43,345 --> 01:14:44,334
Straight or dead.

975
01:14:46,014 --> 01:14:48,141
Either come with me, or I'll
kill you and these queers.

976
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:49,182
Stop it.

977
01:14:49,284 --> 01:14:51,718
-Come on then.
-I know why you're here.

978
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:53,549
You love Guy.

979
01:14:55,424 --> 01:14:56,618
Quen, I love you.

980
01:14:56,725 --> 01:14:57,987
Guy, stop it!

981
01:14:58,093 --> 01:15:00,220
-You can't love me.
-I love you so much.

982
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:01,990
-Stop it, stop it!
-You love Guy.

983
01:15:02,097 --> 01:15:03,359
That's why you came here.

984
01:15:03,465 --> 01:15:04,830
You're after him
because you love him.

985
01:15:06,201 --> 01:15:08,601
You're not gonna
kill him... or us.

986
01:15:14,409 --> 01:15:15,307
I love you.

987
01:15:21,950 --> 01:15:22,678
Fuck.

988
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:34,292
I love you so fucking much,
I feel crazy sometimes.

989
01:15:36,365 --> 01:15:37,559
And all I want is...

990
01:15:40,202 --> 01:15:41,260
What?

991
01:15:44,373 --> 01:15:46,568
I want to kiss you, man.

992
01:15:46,675 --> 01:15:48,199
I want you to kiss me back.

993
01:15:49,611 --> 01:15:54,105
I want to sleep with you and
I want you to touch me all over.

994
01:15:55,717 --> 01:15:58,652
I want you to be with
me all the fucking time.

995
01:15:58,754 --> 01:16:00,745
I'm going crazy.

996
01:16:00,856 --> 01:16:04,758
Then put down the gun.
Violence is for straights.

997
01:16:04,860 --> 01:16:06,384
And you're not straight.

998
01:16:06,495 --> 01:16:08,588
We're just a couple
of queers, Quentin.

999
01:16:12,501 --> 01:16:13,331
No.

1000
01:16:14,770 --> 01:16:16,101
No!
You love him.

1001
01:16:16,204 --> 01:16:17,603
You told him.
You told all of us.

1002
01:16:17,706 --> 01:16:18,832
We all know now.

1003
01:16:18,940 --> 01:16:20,430
I've got you, man.

1004
01:16:20,542 --> 01:16:22,533
There's nothing
to hide anymore.

1005
01:16:26,448 --> 01:16:27,176
For real?

1006
01:16:28,383 --> 01:16:29,111
Yeah.

1007
01:16:30,051 --> 01:16:31,018
For real.

1008
01:16:54,276 --> 01:16:55,868
Don't ever do that again.

1009
01:16:55,977 --> 01:16:57,001
Save a queer?

1010
01:16:57,112 --> 01:17:00,548
Sorry... I learned
from the best.

1011
01:17:00,649 --> 01:17:01,513
Destiny.

1012
01:17:01,616 --> 01:17:03,083
You got in front of a gun.

1013
01:17:03,185 --> 01:17:04,516
You don't know straights.

1014
01:17:04,619 --> 01:17:07,918
Look, Spence, I can't live my
life worried about them.

1015
01:17:08,023 --> 01:17:09,957
I've have to live
my life for me.

1016
01:17:13,361 --> 01:17:14,259
For us.

1017
01:17:16,331 --> 01:17:17,298
Look, Spence...

1018
01:17:19,835 --> 01:17:21,496
I don't know
how to say this but...

1019
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:25,699
I know you wanna blow up
your parents and go away...

1020
01:17:25,807 --> 01:17:26,705
tonight.

1021
01:17:28,443 --> 01:17:31,378
I say fuck 'em, but if you
have to blow them away,

1022
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:34,210
then let's get Miss Ross
and drive right up...

1023
01:17:34,316 --> 01:17:37,308
to their fucking front door
and keep on going,

1024
01:17:37,419 --> 01:17:40,445
right into the living room
and get out of the car,

1025
01:17:40,555 --> 01:17:42,750
right in front of your parents,
sitting in front of the TV...

1026
01:17:42,858 --> 01:17:45,486
watching some straight crazies
and you can introduce me...

1027
01:17:45,594 --> 01:17:48,927
as your lover,
your special friend,

1028
01:17:49,030 --> 01:17:51,931
your fuck buddy,
your boyfriend,

1029
01:17:52,033 --> 01:17:54,194
the guy who sucks your cock,

1030
01:17:54,302 --> 01:17:57,931
fucks your ass and
loves your soul...

1031
01:17:58,039 --> 01:18:02,135
loves you because you're
a queer, for what you are,

1032
01:18:02,244 --> 01:18:03,905
You know what?

1033
01:18:04,012 --> 01:18:06,640
You can't get rid of
them with their weapons.

1034
01:18:06,748 --> 01:18:08,943
I tried that with
the porno guy.

1035
01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:12,914
We have to use our weapons.

1036
01:18:17,993 --> 01:18:18,891
I mean...

1037
01:18:21,763 --> 01:18:25,699
I love you, and
if you have to blow them up,

1038
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:28,928
I'll help you,
like Destiny helped me.

1039
01:18:30,438 --> 01:18:32,167
But if we really
want to fuck them up...

1040
01:18:34,709 --> 01:18:36,802
all we've got to do is kiss.

1041
01:18:36,912 --> 01:18:40,040
Cause when two guys kiss,
its like a bomb goes off...

1042
01:18:40,148 --> 01:18:41,342
in straight world.

1043
01:18:42,717 --> 01:18:44,548
Our kisses are
louder than bombs.

1044
01:18:51,459 --> 01:18:53,791
Love is not an option,
not for me.

1045
01:18:54,262 --> 01:18:56,230
Spence, you have to let
go of them.

1046
01:18:56,331 --> 01:18:59,562
If you blow them up, you're just
going to hang on to their damage
forever.

1047
01:19:01,069 --> 01:19:05,233
You want to blow them up?
Then stay with me. Let me love you.

1048
01:19:06,775 --> 01:19:09,767
Kisses are louder than bombs.
Let's blow them away.

1049
01:19:15,951 --> 01:19:16,610
I can't.

1050
01:19:36,271 --> 01:19:37,169
I can't.

1051
01:19:53,688 --> 01:19:54,620
I love you.

1052
01:19:56,091 --> 01:19:57,058
I love you too.

1053
01:20:00,228 --> 01:20:01,490
No, I mean I really love you.

1054
01:20:07,836 --> 01:20:09,133
I love you so much,
it hurts.

1055
01:20:14,242 --> 01:20:16,142
I never loved anyone before.

1056
01:20:21,349 --> 01:20:22,839
I've had sex
with a lot of guys,

1057
01:20:25,954 --> 01:20:33,122
but to love someone, to want
to be together, always.

1058
01:20:40,068 --> 01:20:41,626
There was a moment
back there when...

1059
01:20:43,738 --> 01:20:45,000
I thought...

1060
01:20:50,078 --> 01:20:52,046
I never expected this to happen.

1061
01:20:55,016 --> 01:20:56,142
Not for me.

1062
01:20:59,387 --> 01:21:01,719
I feel strange when
I'm not with you...

1063
01:21:01,823 --> 01:21:06,089
and when I'm with you, I want
to touch you all the time.

1064
01:21:08,596 --> 01:21:10,154
I can't keep my hands off you.

1065
01:21:13,234 --> 01:21:16,067
My cock is hard, all the time
when I'm with you.

1066
01:21:19,307 --> 01:21:20,797
It's a problem.

1067
01:21:23,244 --> 01:21:25,212
I'm losing control.

1068
01:21:25,313 --> 01:21:26,245
Spence.

1069
01:21:38,426 --> 01:21:41,190
I feel like I'm...
ten years old.

1070
01:21:45,533 --> 01:21:46,397
I feel safe.

1071
01:21:49,938 --> 01:21:50,962
I feel like I'm home.

1072
01:21:53,208 --> 01:21:54,903
You are home.

1073
01:21:55,009 --> 01:21:56,874
I'm home.

1074
01:21:56,978 --> 01:21:58,445
This is it.

1075
01:22:00,115 --> 01:22:02,640
Wherever we are,
that's home.

1076
01:22:12,293 --> 01:22:13,555
Let's go!

1077
01:22:13,661 --> 01:22:14,787
Let's blow them away!

1078
01:22:22,303 --> 01:22:23,099
That was The Pentagon.

1079
01:22:29,077 --> 01:22:30,066
That was The White House.

1080
01:22:31,446 --> 01:22:32,344
This one's Congress.

1081
01:22:37,485 --> 01:22:39,146
Let's blow up the
whole straight world.

1082
01:23:23,431 --> 01:23:24,125
It's open.

1083
01:23:44,953 --> 01:23:45,920
That, okay kid?

1084
01:23:46,020 --> 01:23:46,884
Yeah.

1085
01:23:48,056 --> 01:23:49,387
That's what we
agreed upon, right?

1086
01:23:49,490 --> 01:23:51,458
Yeah, 200.

1087
01:23:51,559 --> 01:23:52,821
No problems, now?

1088
01:23:52,927 --> 01:23:53,791
Nope.

1089
01:23:55,597 --> 01:23:57,360
Now watch that,
take care of it.

1090
01:23:57,465 --> 01:24:00,832
-I know you probably need it.
-Yeah.

1091
01:24:00,935 --> 01:24:02,527
You need anything?

1092
01:24:02,637 --> 01:24:05,902
-Water?
-Nope. Nope.

1093
01:24:06,007 --> 01:24:07,804
Stan'll be here
in a few minutes so...

1094
01:24:07,909 --> 01:24:10,810
I'll film him stripping,
then you and he can get it on.

1095
01:24:10,912 --> 01:24:11,810
Okay?

1096
01:24:11,913 --> 01:24:12,607
Sure.
