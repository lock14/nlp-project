00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:21,719
# Oh, Mr. Pit, oh, Mr. Pit,
Mr. Pitiful #

2
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:24,879
# who let you down? #

3
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:29,039
# who let you down?
Who let you down? #

4
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,679
# You still
don't believe, #

5
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:35,119
# you don't believe,
you don't believe #

6
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:38,359
# and your grievances
show #

7
00:00:38,359 --> 00:00:42,600
# when your soapbox
unfolds #

8
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,000
# but please come down #

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,600
# from that cloud
you're sitting on #

10
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,359
# I don't expect you
to admit #

11
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:53,119
# that you were wrong #

12
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:56,880
# just want to know
how you've been #

13
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,799
# it don't make me
feel bad #

14
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:00,719

15
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,399
# mulling it over
in my bed #

16
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:05,319
# I hope that you see #

17
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:07,040
# through your big yard #

18
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,280
# and white picket fence #

19
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:14,640
# well, I don't believe,
I don't believe #

20
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,560
# I don't believe #

21
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,480
# everything I see #

22
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,159
# and you don't like
the movie #

23
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:23,560
# then quit acting #

24
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,640
# but please come down #

25
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,400
# from that cloud
you're sitting on #

26
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,319
# I don't expect you
to admit #

27
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:33,240
# that you were wrong #

28
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,000

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,879

35
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:57,520

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,959
# still be my friend #

37
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:06,760
# still be my friend. #

38
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,400
We would like to do
a full expose on Arlen Faber.

39
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,319
It would coincide
with the release

40
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:13,240
of the 20th anniversary
of "Me and God."

41
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,400
People want to read
this story.

42
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,879
I've red "Me and God"
12 times, for Chrissake.

43
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:21,240
Sorry.
He listens to you, Terry.

44
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,800
If I could get
five minutes with him,

45
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,719
it would mean everything.

46
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:27,960
He redefined spirituality
for an entire generation.

47
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,280
It's been translated
into over 100 languages.

48
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,079
This book...

49
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:34,439
Arlen Faber isn't going
to talk to you

50
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:35,879
This year or any year.

51
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:38,520
Arlen Faber
doesn't do interviews.

52
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,920
He's refused an audience
with the Dalai Lama.

53
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,199
He has turned down millions
in appearance fees.

54
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:45,960
What would make a man
do this, you ask?

55
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:49,400
Because Arlen Faber
came in direct contact

56
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,879
With the creator himself.

57
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,240
Can you imagine how much
that would change you?

58
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,199
He isn't even
like us anymore.

59
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:59,479
He has no concern
for worldly affairs

60
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:00,840
or possessions.

61
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,039
He has been touched
by the divine

62
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:05,319
and he has given us
the only thing that he could,

63
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:08,120
which is "Me and God."

64
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,039
And if that isn't
enough for you,

65
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:11,960
Then God help you.

66
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,360
Fuck! Shit!
Motherfucker!

67
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,039
Fucking cock.

68
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:23,560
Get a fucking
machine.

69
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,439
Fucking goddamn.
Fuck. Fuck.

70
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,920
Oh, terrific.

71
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,920
I didn't want to leave
this on the doorstep.

72
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,840
It might be important.

73
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,000
You never know
who might snatch it.

74
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,920
Mr. Faber sure gets
a lot of mail.

75
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,840
Is he here to sign
for this today?

76
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,159
No, he isn't.

77
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:45,639
Ever since I took this job,
I've been hoping to meet him.

78
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,719
Tough break.

79
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:50,639
Yeah.

80
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:53,439
Would you mind signing
for it today, please?

81
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,199
My hands are shaking.
I apologize.

82
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:07,639
- Prince Berefton.
- That's me.

83
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:09,599
There you are.

84
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,400
Can I ask you
a small question?

85
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,599
What is
Mr. Faber like?

86
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:16,360
You'd hate him.

87
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,600
Hey, we have

88
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,839
delicious life bacon.

89
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,199
It's for your life.
It's delicious,

90
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:10,079
tastes just like bacon
except...

91
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:12,000
But with delicious
soy protein

92
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,120
sweetened with cane juice
and tomato pulp.

93
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,759
Exactly, and yummy
egg whites

94
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,160
Scrambled just the way
you like them,

95
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,040
which is the scrambly
delicious way.

96
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,879
Uh... Okay.

97
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:27,879
Okay, mommy has
her drink.

98
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:46,199
All out
who's getting out.

99
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:53,279
Bye.

100
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,199
Hurry hurry.

101
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,680
- Here's your lunch.
- Thank you.

102
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,920
Be careful.
Have fun.

103
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:03,040
Be careful.
Have fun.

104
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,079
remember what I said about fear.

105
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:26,920
Fuck everything
and run.

106
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,839
Or face everything
and relax.

107
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:30,759
I know.

108
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:32,639
Remember, when you get out of here,
the first thing you want to do...

109
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,840
I know. "Stay sober.
Get a sponsor and stay sober."

110
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,720
Dad, I'm home.

111
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,920
free unlimited texting and of course

112
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,120
Dad.

113
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,399
I'm back.

114
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:18,920
Don't be mad!
Hey, Kris, don't be mad.

115
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,839
Okay, it's not a big deal,
but don't be mad.

116
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:23,399
Just... okay,
just don't be mad, okay?

117
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:26,079
Um...

118
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:28,319
You lost the keys
for 27 days.

119
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,639
Yeah.

120
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:35,279
The store was closed
for 27 days.

121
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:37,600
I didn't have
anyone else to call.

122
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,279
So I had to wait
for you to be released.

123
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:42,199
Released?

124
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:44,439
I wasn't released.
I'm not a criminal.

125
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:46,840
I was having a problem
with alcohol.

126
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,159
You attacked my umbrella.

127
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:53,079
What?

128
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:55,000
You did.
You were screaming at me

129
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,879
and you were really drunk.
And it was scary.

130
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,040
I'm sorry
I scared you, Dahlia.

131
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,079
I'm sorry
I lost the keys

132
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:15,480
and the store
was closed, Kris.

133
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,399
I actually sat
in his presence.

134
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,440
He actually said to me,
"Dominica, you are awake."

135
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,360
And I said, "I actually
thought I was

136
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,080
Because my guru said I was,
but then somebody said I wasn't,

137
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,039
- so I actually wasn't sure."
- That is, like...

138
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:26,879
Hey, pretend person,
if you're done hallucinating,

139
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:28,960
I'd love a shot at being
a customer in this place.

140
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,399
Welcome back.

141
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:35,039
Can I help you?

142
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:37,720
Yes, these don't work.
I'd like to sell them.

143
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,519
If my conscience would
allow it, I'd burn them,

144
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,320
but instead I'll take
pennies on the dollar.

145
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:45,120
You've read all 21 volumes of "Unlocking
the Door to the Heaven Within"?

146
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,759
Yep, and it still lacked.

147
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:51,440
I'm sorry. I'm afraid we can't
buy any books right now.

148
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,720
Oh, well, I'm afraid I can't keep these
in my house right now, so...

149
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,799
So if you could just
come back next month...

150
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:58,799
So if you could just
get the manager...

151
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:00,679
Oh...

152
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:03,360
I am the manager.

153
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,320
I can't afford it. It's been a
tough couple of months.

154
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,799
Fine.
That's just fine.

155
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:17,759
You can have them
free of charge... my gift to you.

156
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:20,279
I'm not supposed to owe
anyone anything right now.

157
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:21,759
Uh-huh.

158
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:23,679
Stop!

159
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:26,039
Look, it's been
a little slow.

160
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:28,080
The store's been closed
for a while.

161
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,240
We're just getting
back up to speed.

162
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,080
Let me guess...
you were off

163
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,279
giving lap dances
at the piercing festival.

164
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:40,039
God grant me the serenity

165
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:42,679
to accept the terrifying
bullshit I cannot change.

166
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:44,600
I'm sorry.

167
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,480
Maybe next month.

168
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,200
Right now
I can't afford it.

169
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:54,679
Fine.

170
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:00,399
That is just fine.

171
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,320
All right, well,

172
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,200
Let me tell you something,
my little friend.

173
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,799
You...

174
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:16,159
You are gonna
take these books.

175
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,360
Come again.

176
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,159
Okay, Anne, 5:00.

177
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:44,080
Oh, that's fine.

178
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,720
Leave it.

179
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,080
Anne, it's fine.

180
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,519
Look, everything is
gonna be fine.

181
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,159
Debt, waitressing,
chiropractic school...

182
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:59,759
I did not go through four
years of doubt and terror

183
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:02,360
to tank in the first month.
Everything is gonna be fine.

184
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,559
Fine.

185
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:05,039
- Bye.
- Good night.

186
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,879
Well, a great day, huh?

187
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,759
Great.

188
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:27,960
Relax.
I need to relax.

189
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:41,879
# Isn't it romantic? #

190
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:43,879
Oh!

191
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:46,919
No, I refuse
to accept this.

192
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:48,840
No, I do not
accept this.

193
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,320
This is bullshit.
I do not accept it.

194
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,840
# Isn't it romantic? #

195
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:58,080
# moving shadows write #

196
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:03,320
# the oldest
magic word... #

197
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,519
Agh!

198
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:10,320
# I hear
the breezes playing #

199
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,360
# in the trees above... #

200
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:32,759
# isn't it romantic? #

201
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:36,440
# music in the night #

202
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,759
# a dream that can be heard #

203
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:45,399
# Isn't it romantic? #

204
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:49,879
So what do you think?
Are you ready to grab a bite?

205
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:52,360
No.

206
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,679
- I'm sorry?
- No, I'm not ready.

207
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:56,519
Is there
something wrong?

208
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:59,279
No no, everything's great.
You seem great.

209
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:02,519
It's just if there's
a strong reason

210
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:04,440
For me to have someone
in my life,

211
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,360
I'll fight for them.

212
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,519
Okay.

213
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,440
And I can already tell

214
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,960
I'm never going
to fight for you.

215
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,279
I'm so sorry.

216
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:16,080
We just met.

217
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,759
I know. Sad.

218
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:21,519
Wait, when did you stop
fighting for me?

219
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,600
'Cause, hey,
I'd fight for you.

220
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,600
Thank you.

221
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,639
I missed watching
this with you

222
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:33,840
When you were gone.

223
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,120
You know,
I've been thinking...

224
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:40,799
Maybe it might be good
if you and I

225
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:42,399
took a trip together,
you know,

226
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,320
just get the heck
out of here, huh?

227
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,440
Remember that time
we went camping?

228
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,960
We didn't go camping, dad.
We got lost in the woods.

229
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,200
Usually campers have
a tent, water, food.

230
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:57,080
Yeah, camping, just like
the good old days.

231
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,360
Might do you
some good, you know.

232
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,639
I have to go.

233
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:01,480
I'm gonna go
meet some friends.

234
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:16,720
Excuse me.

235
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,000
Yeah?

236
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,919
Did you just have
a meeting in there?

237
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,080
Yeah.

238
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:24,399
I just got through
having 28 in a row.

239
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,559
Good for you.

240
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:28,279
Ross.

241
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,120
Okay.

242
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:35,279
Well, we have
meetings here

243
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,000
all the time,
if you're interested.

244
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,240
Okay, maybe I'll
check one out sometime.

245
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,000
Sure. We're here
if you need us.

246
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,080
#...like a lover's
kiss #

247
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,679
Phone.

248
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:53,600
Terry. Home.

249
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,440
Hello.

250
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,519
Terry, Terry,
you have to come over.

251
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,000
Why are you yelling?

252
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,919
My back is out.

253
00:16:12,919 --> 00:16:14,600
Now I need you
to come over.

254
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,360
Again?

255
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,240
Try asking God for help.

256
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,600
He won't take my calls.
You do.

257
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,600
I'm on the floor.
Get over here.

258
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,200
Terry?

259
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:52,960
After seven years it might be
time to have that looked at.

260
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,720
I have.

261
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,600
But it didn't help,
obviously.

262
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,519
Shall I take a picture
for your fan club?

263
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,920
Thank you for
turning the music off.

264
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,400
I mean it.
Thank you.

265
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,079
Now help me.

266
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,319
You know,
I was a nobody

267
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:17,720
in a big firm of somebodys
when I found your book...

268
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,960
Just a stack of
scribbled pages, really,

269
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:23,079
Sitting on a coffee table
at a party for God-knows-who.

270
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:25,119
Conveniently, nobody
wanted to talk to me,

271
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,480
so I sat there

272
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,759
and I read it.

273
00:17:28,759 --> 00:17:30,920
It was marvelous.

274
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,279
You gave me a career.

275
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:36,079
You changed my life.

276
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:39,200
And now if I don't help you,
you will probably shit your pants.

277
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,720
Agreed.
Help me.

278
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,759
You are a disaster,
Arlen.

279
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:44,480
And these days you're not
my only disaster.

280
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,839
I'm successful
and therefore have many.

281
00:17:46,839 --> 00:17:49,680
Is there a rest stop
between me and the end of this story?

282
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,720
What did you think of the book
I sent over for the 20th anniversary?

283
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,359
- Did you like it?
- Not now, Terry.

284
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:56,799
Did you like the jacket
with the raised gold letters?

285
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:59,160
I loved the gold letters,
loved them.

286
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,000
How about the picture?

287
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,880
God damn it,
it doesn't matter.

288
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,880
It's all meaningless
bullshit.

289
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:09,119
It's not meaningless,
fuckface.

290
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:11,240
I won't help you
if you won't help me.

291
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:16,079
All right, you win.

292
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:19,000
I loved the gold letters

293
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,599
and the picture
was fantastic.

294
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,839
Now help me.

295
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:25,240
There is no picture.

296
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,240
And the letters
are blue.

297
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:33,279
# Do you mean #

298
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:37,000
# that I will fall #

299
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,599
# in love perchance #

300
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:42,519
# isn't it... #

301
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:45,519
# isn't it, isn't it... #

302
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:52,519
# isn't it, isn't it... #

303
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,680
# isn't it, isn't it #

304
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:08,880
# isn't it,
isn't it #

305
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,799
# isn't it, isn't it #

306
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:14,519
# isn't it,
isn't it #

307
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:17,599
# isn't it, isn't it #

308
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:19,519
# isn't it... #

309
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:20,680
I'm lying on my back.

310
00:20:22,599 --> 00:20:24,640
I think I'm ready to buy,
enlarge my portfolio.

311
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:38,039
Any objection
to me being next?

312
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:40,119
Next?

313
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:42,720
Uh, do you have
an appointment?

314
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:45,519
Does it look
like I planned this?

315
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:47,799
So you're a new patient.

316
00:20:47,799 --> 00:20:51,200
I just need you to fill out
this paperwork.

317
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:57,240
But you can't do that.
I'm gonna take your picture,

318
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:01,000
because that's what we do
with all new patients.

319
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,920
Okay.

320
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:09,480
When I can stand,

321
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,359
I will kill you.

322
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,519
I'm just gonna let
the doctor know you're here.

323
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:19,880
- Elizabeth.
- Yeah?

324
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,559
He's a little disgruntled.
I tried to take his picture.

325
00:21:21,559 --> 00:21:23,200
He said he was gonna kill me.

326
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,319
Okay, I'll take care of it.
Hi, follow me.

327
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:28,240
- Not you.
- Oh, okay, right.

328
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,519
Right this way.
Follow me.

329
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:37,200
You're doing great.
My name is Elizabeth and...

330
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,559
Please don't show me that
lame little rubber model of vertebrae.

331
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:41,480
Let's just focus of me
being able to walk out

332
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,400
of this little tea party forever.

333
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,200
What do you say?

334
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,160
All done?

335
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:52,000
Please help me.

336
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,920
Okay, is the pain here?

337
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,119
Yeah, okay, I'm gonna
get you up on the table.

338
00:21:56,119 --> 00:21:58,079
You can do it.
I'm gonna help you.

339
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:00,400
You can do this.
All right.

340
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,519
Okay, yeah.

341
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:05,880
Okay, good.

342
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,240
Okay.

343
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,920
Okay, yeah.

344
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,079
Okay, I'm gonna be
right back.

345
00:22:15,079 --> 00:22:16,880
Don't leave me here.

346
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,440
I just have to tell Anne to clear
my patients for the next hour.

347
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,279
I'll be right back.

348
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:25,000
- We have a real patient.
- Yay!

349
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,200
Shh, be professional.

350
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,119
What was that?

351
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:33,160
A happy customer.

352
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:37,160
Alrighty, so...
What's your name?

353
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:40,720
My name?

354
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,720
Yes, your name.
Who are you?

355
00:22:46,519 --> 00:22:47,599
Arlen.

356
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:51,319
Okay, Arlen,
I'm gonna help you.

357
00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:53,799
And when you leave here
today, you might not be cured,

358
00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:56,279
But you're gonna feel
a lot better, I promise.

359
00:22:56,279 --> 00:22:57,839
Agh!

360
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,839
Okay.

361
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:28,640
I think
you're good for now.

362
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:35,759
Sit up nice and slow.

363
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,920
Walk across the room.

364
00:23:52,279 --> 00:23:54,000
Better?

365
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,960
You are so...

366
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,599
amazing.

367
00:24:04,759 --> 00:24:07,160
I mean, no one has ever
done that before...

368
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,880
No one.
How did you do that?

369
00:24:10,039 --> 00:24:12,640
So, well, I don't know.

370
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,559
You're still a little
out of whack.

371
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:18,400
But you resemble something further
along the evolutionary chart.

372
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,720
How much do I owe you?

373
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,319
Two hours... $175.

374
00:24:31,319 --> 00:24:33,279
Okay.

375
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,200
Oh, no, that's too much.

376
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,839
Take it.
You're a miracle worker.

377
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:41,640
When can l...
should I come back?

378
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,480
You should be fine
for about a week, so next week.

379
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,920
Thank you, Arlen.

380
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,440
Faber.

381
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:53,240
My name is Arlen Faber.

382
00:24:58,039 --> 00:25:02,480
My name is Arlen Faber.

383
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:06,279
I believe you.

384
00:25:06,279 --> 00:25:07,960
Next week, Arlen.

385
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,839
Thank you.

386
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,559
That's Arlen Faber?

387
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,599
Who's Arlen Faber?

388
00:25:30,039 --> 00:25:32,119
So that's Arlen Faber.

389
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:34,240
That's Arlen Faber.

390
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,000
I forgot one.

391
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,519
- Have a good one, Mr. Faber.
- Bye.

392
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:44,119
I knew it!
You're Arlen Faber.

393
00:25:44,119 --> 00:25:45,960
Oh, I can't believe it.

394
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,920
I have read "me and god,"
like, 40 times.

395
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:53,279
My mother is not gonna
believe this.

396
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,640
Oh my god.

397
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,240
Oh, I feel like I'm shaking
the hand of god himself.

398
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,440
Can I ask you
a question?

399
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:03,160
Yes, I will pray
for you, believe me.

400
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:06,200
No, that's not my question.
Just one, please.

401
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,799
One question,
on condition

402
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,720
That you can never,
and I mean never,

403
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,960
Tell anyone
that I live here. Swear it.

404
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,839
I swear it.
I swear it.

405
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:18,319
Mr. Faber,

406
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:21,240
Is there such a place
as hell?

407
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,519
Yes, there is.

408
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:27,319
I think it was Sartreartre
who said it best, really,

409
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:29,240
When he said,
and I quote,

410
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:32,160
"hell is other people."

411
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,359
"...Attempts to
contact you in the past have failed,

412
00:26:38,359 --> 00:26:41,200
so we are forced to resort
to this final action."

413
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,160
Excuse me, I'd like
to sell you this book.

414
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,079
Okay.

415
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:48,519
"consciousness
without an object."

416
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:52,200
Wow, sixth grade is different
than I remember it.

417
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,799
Why do you want
to get rid of this?

418
00:26:53,799 --> 00:26:55,720
I just found...

419
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:59,799
I found...

420
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:05,200
I find the idea

421
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,240
That you can use
a conscious object

422
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:10,519
To consider non-objective
consciousness absurd.

423
00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:13,359
This book is
poison to me.

424
00:27:16,279 --> 00:27:19,599
Uh, I'm sorry.

425
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:22,519
I'm afraid we can't buy
any books right now.

426
00:27:22,519 --> 00:27:24,359
How did he get you
to do this?

427
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,680
He said he'd split
the money with me.

428
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:41,400
Do not split this
with him.

429
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,119
- thank you.
- bye.

430
00:27:44,119 --> 00:27:47,279
That guy does not want
his books. God.

431
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,880
Where were we?

432
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:53,559
If you do not respond
to our request for full payment,

433
00:27:53,559 --> 00:27:55,759
We will have no other choice
but to blah-blah-blah,

434
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:58,519
Red words, blah-blah,
hate, rescind.

435
00:27:58,519 --> 00:28:02,359
Sincerely, first masters bank,
celebrating 150 years of your success."

436
00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:03,759
No.

437
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:05,200
Hi.

438
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,799
Hi. Can I?

439
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:10,519
- Oh, post away.
- Thanks.

440
00:28:18,359 --> 00:28:19,640
Okay.

441
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:22,200
"Mr. Lucas,
you have failed.

442
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,559
We have no other choice but to
celebrate 150 years of your success.

443
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:28,400
That's better. Yay.

444
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:32,799
Excuse me, do you have
"Me and God"?

445
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:24,119
Oh, God,
it's bad... bad.

446
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:27,079
Elizabeth will be with you
in just one minute, Mr. Faber.

447
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:29,759
I think I can sit.

448
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:50,880
What?

449
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:57,440
You have a lot of tension
in your upper back today.

450
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,599
I was out running
the other day, had a little fall.

451
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:01,640
Okay.

452
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,680
I'II just let you sit
for a couple of minutes

453
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,599
and I'll be right back.

454
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:08,240
Stay.

455
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:12,160
And talk to me.

456
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,160
What do you want
to talk about?

457
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,599
Let's talk about you.

458
00:30:16,599 --> 00:30:20,160
Okay.

459
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:23,279
I moved here
from San Francisco.

460
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:27,519
Um, this is new.
I just opened.

461
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:29,440
I have a son
who's seven years old.

462
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,640
A son?

463
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,039
I love kids.

464
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:35,880
They're short, highly emotional people
who don't know anything.

465
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,319
They rely on their
creativity and imagination

466
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:41,039
to get by in the world... a world,
I might add, filled with giants...

467
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,839
an amazing feat.

468
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:46,799
That's lovely. I never
thought about it like that.

469
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:52,759
What about me? Don't you want
to hear my story?

470
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:56,400
Yes.

471
00:30:58,039 --> 00:30:59,640
Okay, thank you.

472
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:02,680
I moved to Philadelphia
10 years go.

473
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:05,319
I'm trying to write a book
about the history of monsters

474
00:31:05,319 --> 00:31:07,240
in movies
and literature.

475
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,160
One day I hope
to find a cure

476
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,839
for people who
listen to techno.

477
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,319
I read your book.

478
00:31:15,319 --> 00:31:17,640
- Oh, great.
- Careful.

479
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,559
I mean, thank you.

480
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,400
I don't know
what I was expecting,

481
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,640
but it wasn't that.

482
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,119
Is that good?

483
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:28,960
Yes, yes.

484
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,279
Oh.

485
00:31:30,279 --> 00:31:33,640
Those were some of the best
answers I've ever heard.

486
00:31:35,079 --> 00:31:37,799
It's beautiful, really.

487
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,200
Does God still
talk to you?

488
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:47,160
Now more than ever.

489
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:04,359
Dad.

490
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:06,400
I made breakfast burritos.
You want one?

491
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,599
No, thanks.

492
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:09,920
Just coffee.

493
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,160
It's like liquid angels.

494
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,200
Ha.

495
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,000
Things aren't going too
well at the bookstore, huh?

496
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,880
I'm not panicked yet,
probably because I'm sober.

497
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:40,240
You still going
to them A.A. Classes?

498
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,680
Uh, a couple.

499
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,000
It's good sometimes.

500
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,720
I don't know.
I don't know.

501
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,839
It's a lot of whining,
I guess.

502
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:57,160
I went to
one of those once.

503
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,599
People there
made me feel

504
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:02,079
like the luckiest guy alive,
you know what I mean?

505
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:04,920
Yeah.

506
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,759
If you want
to go again,

507
00:34:06,759 --> 00:34:08,400
I could scout out
some meetings for you.

508
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,760
- I could.
- No.

509
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,440
You look good, son.

510
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,639
I'm glad.

511
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,679
I'm glad.

512
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,960
Hello, Mr. Arlen Faber.

513
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,719
I just wanted to stop by
and drop off this letter.

514
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:37,480
Who are these people?

515
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,760
Oh, I hope you don't mind.
I was out with my family

516
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,639
- and I remembered that I had that.
- You told. Liar, you swore.

517
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:43,840
Now if you just
give us one moment...

518
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,000
I can't help you.
Do you understand that?

519
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,480
Go away now.

520
00:34:49,039 --> 00:34:53,440
# What a friend
we have in Arlen #

521
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,079
You gotta be
fucking kidding.

522
00:34:55,079 --> 00:34:59,519
# all our sins and griefs
to bear... #

523
00:35:01,719 --> 00:35:04,079
Everybody's been asking
for Robert B. Parker.

524
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:06,440
I don't think we're gonna
get any for two weeks,

525
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,440
Maybe three.

526
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,360
Do you mind
if I wait?

527
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:23,400
Hey.

528
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:26,440
Sir, sir.

529
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,559
Sir.

530
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:30,880
Sir, sir.

531
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,880
Terry.

532
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,519
It's time, Arlen.

533
00:35:57,519 --> 00:36:00,119
No.

534
00:36:01,639 --> 00:36:03,800
It is not time.
No, it isn't.

535
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,320
You promised me
a foreword.

536
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,480
I already sent you
something.

537
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,639
Yes, you did.

538
00:36:09,639 --> 00:36:12,599
You wrote, "get your own
imaginary friend,"

539
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:15,920
followed by a multiple-choice
question about Tom Selleck.

540
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,519
Write whatever you want
and I'll sign it.

541
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:23,719
Listen, you have 10%
of the God market... 10%.

542
00:36:23,719 --> 00:36:27,280
And I, the only person
alive who loves you,

543
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,480
am asking you to write
a couple of pages

544
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:33,320
about the book that you,
Arlen, wrote about him... God.

545
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,760
I've said
all I can say.

546
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,079
Arlen, we have let you out
of every responsibility...

547
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:42,519
every appearance, every book
signing for the last 20 years.

548
00:36:42,519 --> 00:36:45,800
All we are asking is that you write
a couple of pages on the subject.

549
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,920
What is so hard
about that?

550
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,440
Try it sometime
and find out.

551
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,039
I've been
thinking it over

552
00:37:04,039 --> 00:37:05,559
and I want to give you
my phone number.

553
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:09,719
I have a boyfriend.

554
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,199
Not for you.

555
00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:17,480
In case you guys are too busy and
have to cancel an appointment.

556
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,880
That's the reason.

557
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,719
Do you really
have a boyfriend?

558
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:31,960
No.

559
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:35,639
If you did, would you want
to go on walks with him?

560
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,679
Yes.

561
00:37:38,679 --> 00:37:41,440
Good.

562
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:49,599
Hey, you want
to walk around?

563
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:01,639
Another day,

564
00:38:01,639 --> 00:38:03,719
another stroll
with a famous author.

565
00:38:03,719 --> 00:38:05,119
Must be exhausting.

566
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:07,400
Oh, you have no idea.

567
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,920
I hope we're not breaking
some doctor-patient rule here.

568
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,000
No, it's part
of the service.

569
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:22,679
No, I only have
three rules:

570
00:38:22,679 --> 00:38:25,639
Don't take advice from someone
you wouldn't trade places with;

571
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:27,639
try not to do something
you can't take back;

572
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:32,039
and something is what it is
and it's not something else.

573
00:38:32,039 --> 00:38:33,639
I forget my rule,
but I think

574
00:38:33,639 --> 00:38:35,679
it has something to do
with square dancing.

575
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:43,960
Well, this is a street
I probably won't live on.

576
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,880
Oh, you never know.
Anything can happen.

577
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,800
Yeah. In the meantime,
looking's free.

578
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,599
Well, you know
what he says.

579
00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:54,440
No, I sure don't.

580
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:57,320
"For you and you alone
I have made this place

581
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:00,519
kaleidoscope with wonder
to keep your eye upon

582
00:39:00,519 --> 00:39:02,960
as I turn, turn
the world."

583
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,880
Hmm, I don't remember that
from the book.

584
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:15,000
# Beautiful dreamer #

585
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,400
# wake unto me #

586
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,800
# starlight and dewdrops #

587
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:24,519
# are waiting for thee... #

588
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,920
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

589
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,960
Do you know where
Arlen Faber lives?

590
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,239
I do.

591
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:43,079
- 2032, five blocks down.
- Thanks.

592
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:45,519
- He threw water on my family.
- I'm sorry, what?

593
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:49,280
We were singing the hymn and he
threw a bucket of water on us.

594
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,719
Be careful with him.

595
00:39:51,719 --> 00:39:54,519
Maybe he wrote "Me and God,"
but he did not read it.

596
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:07,039
So you're Arlen Faber.

597
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:10,000
You had no idea I'd be
this handsome, did you?

598
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,199
- I really liked your book.
- I know.

599
00:40:11,199 --> 00:40:13,400
But I need to be straight
with you right now.

600
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,639
Shoot.

601
00:40:14,639 --> 00:40:16,440
I can't accept any more
books right now.

602
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,400
And it seems you really
want to get rid of some books.

603
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,960
Oh, you noticed,
did you?

604
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,000
I'm willing
to make you a deal.

605
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,119
I could use a little
advice every now and then,

606
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:26,280
even from someone
as obviously crazy as yourself.

607
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,360
So here's
what I propose:

608
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,039
I'll let you trade me
books for questions.

609
00:40:30,039 --> 00:40:31,960
I have a question...

610
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,639
can you guess how much
I hate this idea?

611
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,800
More than you would hate

612
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,119
every single new-age
sandal-wearing

613
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:41,800
yoga-practicing fanatic
who walks into my store

614
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,960
knowing where you live?

615
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:47,000
Come on, just
three books per visit...

616
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,079
no one knows
where you live,

617
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:50,440
Except for the guy
whose family you drenched.

618
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:07,159
Five books, and you
don't get to argue with me.

619
00:41:07,159 --> 00:41:09,199
You ask, I answer.
That's it.

620
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:11,480
- Deal.
- Now if we have completed

621
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,840
our little Faustian bargain, I would
like to go back inside

622
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,079
and weep for the life
I used to have.

623
00:41:15,079 --> 00:41:18,719
- I didn't get to ask you...
- Yes, you did.

624
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,679
So how are you today?

625
00:41:28,679 --> 00:41:31,599
Good good.
A little stiff, but better.

626
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:33,639
You?

627
00:41:33,639 --> 00:41:36,559
I'm great,
really really great.

628
00:41:36,559 --> 00:41:38,519
Yeah?
And why is that?

629
00:41:38,519 --> 00:41:40,320
My son got a 4
on his paper yesterday

630
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:43,039
And he feels
really great.

631
00:41:43,039 --> 00:41:45,000
What happened to an "A"?

632
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,360
Why isn't a 1 perfect?
A 4?

633
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:49,280
I have no idea.

634
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,159
Okay, and on three.

635
00:41:51,159 --> 00:41:54,599
One, two, three.

636
00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:58,199
Oh! Ahh.

637
00:41:58,199 --> 00:42:00,039
Would you like
to meet him?

638
00:42:02,679 --> 00:42:04,599
Alex, this is
my friend Arlen.

639
00:42:04,599 --> 00:42:06,519
Arlen, this is Alex.

640
00:42:06,519 --> 00:42:08,920
Word on the street is
you got a 4.

641
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,920
- Any truth to that?
- Yes.

642
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:13,800
- Well, congratulations.
- Thank you.

643
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,719
- It's nice meeting you.
- Nice meeting you.

644
00:42:18,039 --> 00:42:20,000
I'll be right back.

645
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,400
A great kid.

646
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,360
Yeah? Thanks.

647
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,920
You want to know
something cool

648
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,599
About shaking hands
with little people?

649
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:33,760
Uh, okay.

650
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,880
They see us shaking hands,
but they don't know

651
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,800
that we squeeze
the other person's hand.

652
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,559
So they just hold hands
with you for a couple of seconds.

653
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:43,119
- That is cool.
- Yeah yeah, it really is.

654
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:48,360
See you soon.

655
00:42:58,679 --> 00:43:01,400
Hey.

656
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,719
Why is everybody
shaking my hand?

657
00:43:15,239 --> 00:43:17,159
Why can't I do
the things I want to do?

658
00:43:17,159 --> 00:43:19,079
There's so much I know
I'm capable of

659
00:43:19,079 --> 00:43:21,000
that I never actually do.
Why is that?

660
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,159
The trick is to realize that you're
always doing what you want to do...

661
00:43:23,159 --> 00:43:24,840
always.

662
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,760
Nobody's making you
do anything.

663
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,679
Once you get that,
you see that you're free

664
00:43:28,679 --> 00:43:30,920
and that life is really
just a series of choices.

665
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:33,480
Nothing happens to you.
You choose.

666
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:42,039
There's seven books here.

667
00:43:42,039 --> 00:43:44,679
A pre-coffee penalty...
two extra books.

668
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:50,760
If God made everything,

669
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,840
then why are
some things bad,

670
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:55,280
like, for example, the whole
pain-and-suffering thing?

671
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,760
Opposites...

672
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:59,719
without things that suck, you would have
no idea what good was

673
00:43:59,719 --> 00:44:01,320
and therefore would be
directionless.

674
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:03,360
You smell shit,
and you walk the other way.

675
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:20,840
Do I have a destiny,
or is it all free will?

676
00:44:22,199 --> 00:44:24,159
Destiny or free will?

677
00:44:24,159 --> 00:44:27,480
Free will... moving toward
or away from a purpose.

678
00:44:41,239 --> 00:44:43,159
Hello, "straighten up"
healing center.

679
00:44:43,159 --> 00:44:45,079
This is Arlen.

680
00:44:45,079 --> 00:44:47,559
Elizabeth, I felt
that our walk was

681
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:50,280
Too short the other day.
I asked you to go for a walk.

682
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:52,199
Perhaps it wasn't
as long as it should be

683
00:44:52,199 --> 00:44:54,440
when someone asks
for that.

684
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:57,519
I don't usually
go for walks with people.

685
00:44:57,519 --> 00:44:59,679
I forget the protocol.

686
00:44:59,679 --> 00:45:01,599
What the
hell am I talking about?

687
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:03,519
I know there's no
walk protocol per se.

688
00:45:03,519 --> 00:45:05,639
I mean, what would that be?
What could it be?

689
00:45:05,639 --> 00:45:07,280
Fuck. Fuck!

690
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,760
You know, I hate answering
machines. For this very reason.

691
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,360
They're like life... you can't
take anything back.

692
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:16,639
I would like to go out with
you. I would like to go out with you.

693
00:45:16,639 --> 00:45:18,960
Did I already say that?
Tomorrow night.

694
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,480
And I hope
you will call me back

695
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:23,400
on my phone...

696
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:26,159
the one here
at my home.

697
00:45:26,159 --> 00:45:28,679
Fuck.

698
00:45:28,679 --> 00:45:30,599
That was weird.

699
00:45:32,159 --> 00:45:33,880
Play it again.

700
00:45:35,559 --> 00:45:38,239
Are you ready
to take control of your life?

701
00:45:38,239 --> 00:45:39,880
Yes.

702
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:42,119
There is one
who has all the answers.

703
00:45:42,119 --> 00:45:44,039
All you have to do
is ask.

704
00:45:44,039 --> 00:45:47,159
Ask. Ask.

705
00:45:47,159 --> 00:45:50,840
I want her
to like me, but...

706
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:53,360
Peace is your birthright.

707
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:55,559
Ask and you shall receive.

708
00:45:55,559 --> 00:45:56,800
Stop interrupting.

709
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,159
Wisdom is like
a fox in winter.

710
00:45:59,159 --> 00:46:01,440
And the ice is
where he dances.

711
00:46:12,159 --> 00:46:14,440
Kris, listen,
I gotta go.

712
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:16,360
I don't have time
to tell you why we dream

713
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:18,559
or help you manifest
sanity. Maybe tomorrow.

714
00:46:18,559 --> 00:46:21,119
I'm trying to stay sober
and my dad won't stop drinking.

715
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:23,320
How can I love him even though
he's selfish and he's scaring me?

716
00:46:24,679 --> 00:46:27,719
Um,

717
00:46:27,719 --> 00:46:29,079
that's hard.

718
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,440
I guess what's getting in the way
are your expectations...

719
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,960
If he would do "x",
then you'd be happy.

720
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:40,599
It doesn't work
that way.

721
00:46:40,599 --> 00:46:42,320
I think you have to
let go of that

722
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:44,239
and maybe what you want
will happen

723
00:46:44,239 --> 00:46:45,840
and maybe it won't.

724
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,480
Either way,
you're better off.

725
00:46:50,039 --> 00:46:51,880
And you should go
to A.A. Meetings.

726
00:46:53,559 --> 00:46:56,239
- It's hard.
- Yes, it is.

727
00:47:00,239 --> 00:47:01,719
So you want to give me
some books or something?

728
00:47:03,199 --> 00:47:06,079
Oh, twice as many
next time.

729
00:47:08,519 --> 00:47:10,440
I'm sorry about
when we met...

730
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:13,760
the lap-dancing-
piercing-festival comment.

731
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,480
I didn't know you were
having such a hard time.

732
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:19,480
So you're only awful
to people that don't have problems.

733
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:21,320
It's good to know.

734
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:33,000
I'm ready to take control of my life.

735
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,760
I'm ready to take
control of my life.

736
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:38,639
I'm ready
to take control...

737
00:47:41,239 --> 00:47:43,159
Of my life.

738
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:54,480
I thought I heard you out
here. What are you doing?

739
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:57,079
Uh, stretching.
I was...

740
00:47:57,079 --> 00:48:00,159
I always stretch
before I knock.

741
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,400
Anne, we're going.

742
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:10,559
- Hi, Arlen.
- Hi, Alex.

743
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,199
Hi, Anne.

744
00:48:14,199 --> 00:48:16,360
- You wear a lot of hats.
- Yeah.

745
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:19,559
- Okay, be good for Annie.
- Okay.

746
00:48:19,559 --> 00:48:22,199
Mommy will give you a kiss when
she gets home. It won't be too late.

747
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:25,119
You know what to do. No sweets tonight,
okay? Just popcorn.

748
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:27,320
Call me if you need
anything. Use the fruit spray.

749
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:30,480
- There's light bulbs.
- You're freaking out.

750
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,880
Can he tell?

751
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,960
- Not yet.
- Not yet what?

752
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:37,239
Nothing.

753
00:48:37,239 --> 00:48:39,559
And there's just a few
more things I put down for you...

754
00:48:39,559 --> 00:48:42,199
- Just a few.
- I've done this before.

755
00:48:42,199 --> 00:48:44,519
I love you, baby.
Mm, I love you.

756
00:48:44,519 --> 00:48:46,440
- I love you too, mom.
- I love you. Okay.

757
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,360
I love you.
I love you.

758
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:51,400
- Mwah!
- Have fun.

759
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:53,760
The Air Force should be dropping
off supplies in the next couple of days.

760
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,239
So see if you can
hold on till then.

761
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:07,480
You look beautiful.

762
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:09,440
Thank you.

763
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:13,360
Take me out, Arlen.

764
00:49:38,119 --> 00:49:40,519
This is nice.

765
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:43,000
I bet this is where you take
all your chiropractors.

766
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,599
Is it obvious?

767
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:49,119
So how did you come to be
the angel of alignment?

768
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:55,079
Well, I needed
to start over.

769
00:49:55,079 --> 00:49:57,239
I needed a change.

770
00:49:57,239 --> 00:49:59,880
And I liked
the immediacy of it.

771
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:02,760
People walk in,
or crawl in, hurt,

772
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:05,400
And when they leave
they feel better, and I did it.

773
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:07,480
- And the legend is born.
- Oh.

774
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:10,039
What good are the gifts we
have if we don't share them?

775
00:50:10,039 --> 00:50:12,440
I like that we have that
in common.

776
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:15,880
To a great chiropractor.

777
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:19,559
To a great...

778
00:50:19,559 --> 00:50:23,159
transcriber of thoughts
from outer space.

779
00:50:27,039 --> 00:50:29,320
Tell me about Alexander.

780
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:31,559
Alex.
He hates "A lexander."

781
00:50:31,559 --> 00:50:33,360
Alex.

782
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:34,800
He's great.
He's a great kid.

783
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:38,079
He keeps me together
just by being around, you know?

784
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:40,280
How often does he see
his dad?

785
00:50:43,039 --> 00:50:45,199
Oh, well,

786
00:50:45,199 --> 00:50:48,760
he hasn't seen his father
in over three years.

787
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:50,760
What happened?

788
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:59,400
Alex's dad
was one of those guys

789
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:01,639
who always has
a great new idea,

790
00:51:01,639 --> 00:51:04,960
and for a while
that was us.

791
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:07,119
And then one day

792
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:09,280
he took Alex
to the park

793
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:12,719
and told him that he had
to go away for a little while,

794
00:51:12,719 --> 00:51:15,440
but he would be back
in two weeks... two weeks.

795
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,559
And that turned into
three years.

796
00:51:17,559 --> 00:51:19,679
Alex was just so little

797
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:22,679
that I hope he,
you know, forgot.

798
00:51:24,599 --> 00:51:26,480
Really, I should have
known better.

799
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,199
- Oh, no.
- Are you okay?

800
00:51:28,199 --> 00:51:30,119
- Fuck no.
- Arlen?

801
00:51:30,119 --> 00:51:32,440
Don't move.

802
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:38,079
If you don't stop
playing that song,

803
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:40,519
I will chew
through my wrists.

804
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:51,320
Where were we?

805
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:54,599
I guess I was just boring you
with stories about my life.

806
00:51:54,599 --> 00:51:56,320
No no no, please.
I'm sorry.

807
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:58,280
No, this is a nice place
and I'm bringing it down.

808
00:51:58,280 --> 00:51:59,639
No, I'm listening.

809
00:51:59,639 --> 00:52:01,800
He's listening.

810
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:07,119
What do you want to hear?
You want to hear about

811
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:09,719
How I'm so freaked out that
I'm not doing everything I can;

812
00:52:09,719 --> 00:52:11,639
That I'm so freaked out
all the time;

813
00:52:11,639 --> 00:52:14,639
That I'm afraid
that I'm not doing enough;

814
00:52:14,639 --> 00:52:17,320
And that that fear is turning me
into somebody I don't want to be

815
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:19,719
and I can't stop it?
You have no idea what it's like

816
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:22,559
to be pulled all the time...
I mean, not by Alex

817
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:24,920
but by this idea
that I'm not doing enough;

818
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:28,320
That I am not enough.

819
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:31,559
He knows.

820
00:52:31,559 --> 00:52:33,480
And he wants you to know

821
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:35,719
that you are enough
and so much more.

822
00:52:35,719 --> 00:52:40,199
You are here so God can experience
the world through your eyes,

823
00:52:40,199 --> 00:52:43,519
see what you see,
feel what you feel.

824
00:52:43,519 --> 00:52:46,159
Every day he can't wait

825
00:52:46,159 --> 00:52:48,679
to see what you'll do,

826
00:52:48,679 --> 00:52:50,760
what makes you laugh,
what moves you...

827
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:53,760
He can't wait.
Every day through you

828
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:56,880
He falls in love
with the world all over again.

829
00:52:59,559 --> 00:53:02,679
Elizabeth,
you are his muse.

830
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:11,880
Thank you.

831
00:53:15,719 --> 00:53:18,960
Oh my God,
it's so beautiful.

832
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:20,320
Yes, it is.

833
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:22,559
I bet you have
some great parties here.

834
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:25,599
Oh, no one has been
in here for five years.

835
00:53:27,239 --> 00:53:28,400
Five years?

836
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:31,079
Since my father died.

837
00:53:31,079 --> 00:53:33,960
Oh, I'm sorry.

838
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:36,360
Me too.

839
00:53:39,239 --> 00:53:41,960
Don't touch that.

840
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:43,800
I won't.

841
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:46,480
Hey, I want
to show you something.

842
00:53:48,639 --> 00:53:50,559
Okay.

843
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:06,760
This is my office.

844
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:08,519
I know.
I saw the sign.

845
00:54:08,519 --> 00:54:10,119
Why are there
signs everywhere?

846
00:54:10,119 --> 00:54:12,039
Because my dad
had Alzheimer's

847
00:54:12,039 --> 00:54:14,760
and in the end it was hard
for him to remember things.

848
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:16,920
So the signs helped
for a while.

849
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:24,119
Ta-dah!

850
00:54:24,119 --> 00:54:26,000
- Wow.
- I kind of collect them.

851
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,800
My dad and I used to watch
monster movies together.

852
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,360
And I kept the models
from when I was a kid.

853
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:34,079
And over the years, you know,
I'd pick up another one at a garage sale

854
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:36,360
or a science-fiction expo.

855
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:38,760
I really like them.

856
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:41,320
And I think I've got
a pretty good collection,

857
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:44,360
If you like
that sort of thing.

858
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:46,519
Maybe not.
It's not for everybody.

859
00:54:46,519 --> 00:54:48,559
It's dumb, I guess.
We should go.

860
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:50,239
No, I love 'em.

861
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:54,719
I think
they're wonderful.

862
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:56,679
- You do?
- Yeah.

863
00:54:58,239 --> 00:54:59,840
What are they doing
all crammed in here, though?

864
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:02,679
You should put them out.
God knows you have the room.

865
00:55:02,679 --> 00:55:04,519
Where are you going?

866
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:12,000
There, that's better.

867
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,639
But I don't want it there. I want it
back with the other monsters.

868
00:55:14,639 --> 00:55:17,920
Okay, just try it out.

869
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:19,679
Consider it an experiment.

870
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:24,960
- Arlen.
- Hmm?

871
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:26,719
Thank you
for bringing me here.

872
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:28,480
Oh...

873
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:30,599
You caught me
off-guard tonight.

874
00:55:30,599 --> 00:55:34,920
Tell me,
am I the first girl

875
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:36,960
to see your monsters?

876
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:38,239
I'm sorry.

877
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:40,079
Just give me one second,
all right?

878
00:55:43,559 --> 00:55:45,480
Don't go away.

879
00:55:48,119 --> 00:55:50,480
I'm blowing it again,
aren't I?

880
00:55:52,199 --> 00:55:54,119
No, I love it

881
00:55:54,119 --> 00:55:55,519
when I'm about
to kiss someone

882
00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:57,760
and they leave me
to protect a plastic toy.

883
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:02,760
But...

884
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:05,159
a kiss is
so much better

885
00:56:05,159 --> 00:56:07,159
knowing they're safe.

886
00:56:18,679 --> 00:56:21,519
I gotta just remember to let that shit
go, you know what I mean?

887
00:56:21,519 --> 00:56:25,079
It's just a car, right?
It's not life-or-death.

888
00:56:25,079 --> 00:56:27,719
Wasn't that long ago,
if somebody cut me off

889
00:56:27,719 --> 00:56:29,199
I'd go on
a three-day binge.

890
00:56:29,199 --> 00:56:33,280
And now I just pray
silently for their death.

891
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:41,360
Hi, my name is Ross
and I'm an alcoholic.

892
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:43,559
Hi, Ross.

893
00:56:43,559 --> 00:56:45,519
That's about all the time
that we have,

894
00:56:45,519 --> 00:56:48,039
unless anyone has
a burning desire.

895
00:56:49,199 --> 00:56:50,440
What about you...

896
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:52,360
The newcomer?

897
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:58,960
Fine. You want me
to say something?

898
00:57:00,239 --> 00:57:02,800
How about this?

899
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,719
I fucking hate this.

900
00:57:04,719 --> 00:57:06,679
I fucking hate
that I have to be here.

901
00:57:06,679 --> 00:57:08,559
And I fucking hate
all of you

902
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:09,840
and your pathetic
little stories.

903
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:11,840
I can't believe
I've ended up here.

904
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:15,159
It's fucked.
I'm fucked.

905
00:57:15,159 --> 00:57:16,760
And you're fucked too.

906
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:19,119
- I hear that.
- I hear that.

907
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:21,079
- I hear that too.
- Right on.

908
00:57:22,199 --> 00:57:24,119
Listen, I've got
a great plan.

909
00:57:24,119 --> 00:57:26,719
I think what I'll do is walk around
at night tripping the locals,

910
00:57:26,719 --> 00:57:28,639
throwing their backs
out of alignment.

911
00:57:28,639 --> 00:57:30,679
It's tough work,
but the war needs soldiers.

912
00:57:30,679 --> 00:57:34,920
Well, that sounds great.
When can you start?

913
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:37,480
Good luck on the moon.
We always knew you could do it.

914
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:39,199
Thanks.

915
00:57:41,519 --> 00:57:43,440
Gee, you think
he's gonna be safe?

916
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:45,480
Are you
making fun of me?

917
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:48,360
No, I was just making fun

918
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:50,280
of that inquisition holdover
of a car seat.

919
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:53,400
One more strap... I think
you could get him to confess.

920
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:55,880
Keeps him safe.

921
00:57:58,159 --> 00:58:00,480
- Okay, I'll see you later.
- Yeah, mm-hmm.

922
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:14,000
So what's the deal with
heaven and hell anyway?

923
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,800
I've seen hell, and it's name is
Reno, Nevada.

924
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:24,039
I can't believe God would
punish people for not believing in him.

925
00:58:24,039 --> 00:58:25,960
Ah, the rapture.

926
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:27,880
What's that?

927
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:30,440
Well, I like to think
of it as a monster movie.

928
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:33,800
The monster destroys
some people and spares others.

929
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:36,840
So who is the monster?

930
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:38,760
God.

931
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:41,239
God is the monster.

932
00:58:46,119 --> 00:58:48,639
Have you been to
the chiropractor recently?

933
00:58:48,639 --> 00:58:50,559
"Straighten up"
healing center...

934
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:52,639
We'll heal you
as you straighten.

935
00:58:52,639 --> 00:58:54,000
No way.

936
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,239
"Straighten up"
healing center.

937
00:58:55,239 --> 00:58:57,760
Have you been to
the chiropractor recently?

938
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:00,079
What are you doing?

939
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:02,480
Elizabeth said we needed
to get the word out.

940
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:04,360
Nobody wants to talk
to a spine.

941
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:06,239
We're offering
a discount.

942
00:59:06,239 --> 00:59:09,119
- A spine?
- I don't mind.

943
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:10,519
"Straighten up"
healing center.

944
00:59:10,519 --> 00:59:13,199
- A spine?
- I don't mind.

945
00:59:13,199 --> 00:59:14,920
Bye, Mr. Mankowitz.
See you next week.

946
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:17,039
We're a new business.
We have to advertise.

947
00:59:17,039 --> 00:59:19,320
Is that helping
your business?

948
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:20,320
Oh, no.

949
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:23,960
Honey, how did
that happen?

950
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:25,880
- We got you.
- Hang in there, Anne.

951
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:28,360
We've got a bone saw
around here somewhere.

952
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:30,360
That's so funny.

953
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:32,000
Honey, we'll get you
out of it.

954
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,960
- Oh.
- Oh, no. Are you okay?

955
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:36,320
- I'll go home.
- Go home now?

956
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:38,639
- Well, that sucked.
- Oh, no.

957
00:59:38,639 --> 00:59:42,480
I'm so sorry.
Are you coming back?

958
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,960
Do you want me
to call you later?

959
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:48,559
What are we
gonna do with you?

960
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:49,920
I can take him
to the park.

961
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:51,840
- Okay.
- No, that's okay.

962
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:53,760
It's more complicated
than you think.

963
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:55,800
I can take a kid
to a park.

964
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:58,320
Right.

965
00:59:58,320 --> 01:00:00,239
- Wanna do that?
- Yes.

966
01:00:00,239 --> 01:00:01,440
Yes?

967
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:03,360
- Okay, go to the park.
- Come on.

968
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:05,480
Just to the park, though,
right? Be careful.

969
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:07,760
I mean, have fun.
Be careful.

970
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:10,800
Just the park.
Have fun.

971
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:15,880
I don't ever want
to step on a nail.

972
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:18,440
Got it.

973
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:25,159
In your house, do you
have a favorite towel?

974
01:00:25,159 --> 01:00:26,800
Yes.

975
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:31,719
I can read
upside down.

976
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:38,199
Hey, I got something
for you.

977
01:00:44,679 --> 01:00:46,960
It's a proper vehicle

978
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:49,199
For future missions.

979
01:00:52,639 --> 01:00:54,559
What are you waiting for?
Go play already.

980
01:00:54,559 --> 01:00:56,280
- Can I?
- Yeah, get out of here.

981
01:01:03,039 --> 01:01:05,000
I don't really have
a favorite towel.

982
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,400
Me neither.

983
01:01:13,199 --> 01:01:15,039
Bring it in.
Bring it in.

984
01:01:15,039 --> 01:01:16,960
That's it.
Come on.

985
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:19,320
Circle the airport.
Circle the airport.

986
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:22,800
That's it.
Bring it in.

987
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:30,480
Kris, now is
not a good time.

988
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:33,159
My dad died today.

989
01:01:33,159 --> 01:01:35,280
Hi.

990
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:37,920
- My dad died today.
- Oh my God.

991
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:39,840
I didn't know where else to
go, so I just came here.

992
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:41,440
I know it's not
our regular time,

993
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:43,440
So you can give me some extra
books if you want to.

994
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:44,719
- What's he talking about?
- Nothing. Kris,

995
01:01:44,719 --> 01:01:46,480
now is not a good time.

996
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:48,599
I'm thirsty.

997
01:01:48,599 --> 01:01:50,519
Yeah, Arlen, get him
something to drink.

998
01:01:50,519 --> 01:01:52,440
Sure.

999
01:01:53,679 --> 01:01:55,599
I've never been in here.

1000
01:01:55,599 --> 01:01:58,079
- The place is huge.
- It is.

1001
01:01:58,079 --> 01:02:00,000
He's got nice stuff.

1002
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:10,119
Thanks.

1003
01:02:16,239 --> 01:02:19,079
So I came home
and I found him.

1004
01:02:19,079 --> 01:02:21,679
He was sitting
at the table

1005
01:02:21,679 --> 01:02:23,840
doing a crossword puzzle.

1006
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:25,559
He never does
crossword puzzles.

1007
01:02:25,559 --> 01:02:27,480
Kris just got out
of rehab.

1008
01:02:29,519 --> 01:02:31,679
Oh.
Are you okay?

1009
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:35,480
Hey, let's not talk.
Let's just sit here.

1010
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:37,719
That's a good idea.

1011
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:43,119
What did you mean
about extra books?

1012
01:02:43,119 --> 01:02:45,800
I own a little bookstore...
"Book Trader."

1013
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:47,320
Oh, yeah, that's where
I bought your book.

1014
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:48,800
Perfect.

1015
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:51,159
Arlen tried to sell me back
some books and I couldn't afford it.

1016
01:02:51,159 --> 01:02:53,039
So he freaked out.
And now I come to his house

1017
01:02:53,039 --> 01:02:54,840
and exchange books
for questions.

1018
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:57,159
You make him pay for his
questions with books?

1019
01:02:57,159 --> 01:02:59,159
- Totally fair.
- No, it's not. It's awful.

1020
01:02:59,159 --> 01:03:01,559
You haven't heard
the questions.

1021
01:03:01,559 --> 01:03:03,480
Arlen, I can't
feel anything...

1022
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:04,800
Nothing.

1023
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:06,679
I should be able
to feel something, shouldn't I?

1024
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:20,800
Do you like
working at the bookstore?

1025
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:21,880
I love the bookstore...

1026
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:25,519
All those ideas
somebody cared enough about

1027
01:03:25,519 --> 01:03:27,440
To put all that
work into.

1028
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:29,519
I could never do
anything like that.

1029
01:03:29,519 --> 01:03:32,679
Sometimes I'll just stand in
the middle of the store at night

1030
01:03:32,679 --> 01:03:35,639
and imagine that all those
authors are surrounding me.

1031
01:03:35,639 --> 01:03:39,679
I close my eyes and pretend that
they're trying to tell me something.

1032
01:03:39,679 --> 01:03:41,920
They are. They're saying,
"Give me your money."

1033
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:48,360
What else?

1034
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:51,840
What else do you love
about the bookstore?

1035
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:59,280
I love that I feel
safe there.

1036
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:02,440
Safe from what?

1037
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:05,079
- I don't know.
- Yes, you do.

1038
01:04:05,079 --> 01:04:06,440
No.

1039
01:04:07,519 --> 01:04:10,199
Come on,
safe from what?

1040
01:04:13,119 --> 01:04:16,800
Safe...

1041
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:20,039
Safe from being scared
all the time...

1042
01:04:20,039 --> 01:04:22,679
all the time.

1043
01:04:22,679 --> 01:04:25,480
I get so tired of it.

1044
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:28,119
I get so tired
of being scared.

1045
01:04:28,119 --> 01:04:30,159
I get...

1046
01:04:39,159 --> 01:04:40,920
My dad died today.

1047
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:42,800
I know, baby.

1048
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:45,360
I know.

1049
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:47,760
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

1050
01:04:55,639 --> 01:04:57,840
- Will you be okay?
- Yeah.

1051
01:04:57,840 --> 01:04:59,840
Come by the office
this week, okay...

1052
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:01,760
A free adjustment?

1053
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:03,679
Okay.

1054
01:05:09,199 --> 01:05:11,760
Hey, I'm around, you know. If you need
anything, you can come by.

1055
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:13,880
We'll see.

1056
01:05:16,199 --> 01:05:18,400
- Hey, you want to...?
- I need to go.

1057
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:22,800
Oh. Oh.

1058
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:25,920
Why is it that
when you're with me

1059
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:27,599
you say the most
amazing things,

1060
01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:30,480
but when some broken-down kid
who's lost his dad needs you...

1061
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:33,320
Nothing.
Why is that?

1062
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:34,639
It's complicated.

1063
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:36,559
Really?

1064
01:05:36,559 --> 01:05:39,159
I would think something like
that is easy for Arlen Faber.

1065
01:05:39,159 --> 01:05:41,480
Hey, would you just...?

1066
01:05:43,199 --> 01:05:44,880
What?
What is it, Arlen?

1067
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:46,800
What are you hiding?

1068
01:05:49,679 --> 01:05:51,599
Time's up.

1069
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:55,800
You can't do this.

1070
01:05:57,360 --> 01:06:00,239
I showed you
my monsters.

1071
01:06:04,679 --> 01:06:06,039
Are you really
Arlen Faber?

1072
01:06:07,719 --> 01:06:09,119
No.

1073
01:06:09,119 --> 01:06:11,760
And neither is
Arlen Faber.

1074
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:53,519
Anne, it's me.
I'm calling again. I'm so sorry.

1075
01:06:53,519 --> 01:06:54,880
I promised I wouldn't call
again. I know, I know.

1076
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:57,159
I just wanted to tell you
one more time I'm so sorry.

1077
01:06:57,159 --> 01:06:58,320
I'll never make you wear
a costume again.

1078
01:06:58,320 --> 01:06:59,920
Just a minute.

1079
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:01,719
I promise, not even
for Halloween.

1080
01:07:01,719 --> 01:07:03,679
So please,
if there's...

1081
01:07:09,159 --> 01:07:11,280
So when I figured out
it was him, he agreed to help me

1082
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:13,199
as long as I didn't
tell anybody who he is.

1083
01:07:13,199 --> 01:07:15,519
Why doesn't he want
anyone to know who he is?

1084
01:07:15,519 --> 01:07:17,440
I don't know.

1085
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:20,039
Maybe it's because he's supposed
to have all the answers,

1086
01:07:20,039 --> 01:07:21,679
and he's a disaster.

1087
01:07:25,039 --> 01:07:27,199
Are you his girlfriend
or something?

1088
01:07:27,199 --> 01:07:29,519
No.

1089
01:07:29,519 --> 01:07:32,280
Were you before I told you
he wore a disguise?

1090
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:33,519
No, but that
didn't help.

1091
01:07:33,519 --> 01:07:35,400
Do you like him?

1092
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:39,320
Doesn't matter.

1093
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:40,360
All done.

1094
01:07:44,119 --> 01:07:46,079
Well, I'll come by
the bookstore this week.

1095
01:07:46,079 --> 01:07:49,679
Better hurry. Might be
going-out-of-business sale time for me.

1096
01:07:49,679 --> 01:07:50,639
Oh.

1097
01:07:53,559 --> 01:07:56,280
Yeah, the first one's free,
then they own you.

1098
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:09,960
Hello.

1099
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:11,920
Hi, it's Elizabeth.

1100
01:08:13,679 --> 01:08:15,159
Calling to apologize?

1101
01:08:15,159 --> 01:08:17,880
No, look, I need
to ask you a favor.

1102
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:20,439
Well, word on the street is
I don't help anyone.

1103
01:08:20,439 --> 01:08:23,199
Look, Anne isn't here.

1104
01:08:23,199 --> 01:08:25,880
I have a client.
I'm stuck.

1105
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:27,239
I'm not hearing
a favor in here.

1106
01:08:27,239 --> 01:08:28,600
I can't believe I'm
gonna ask you to do this,

1107
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:30,920
but could you please go
and pick up Alex from school

1108
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:33,000
and bring him to your place
and I'll pick him up later?

1109
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
And do not talk
to anyone.

1110
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,920
No talking.

1111
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:39,159
And I told them
you're my brother.

1112
01:08:39,159 --> 01:08:40,920
- You what?
- I had to.

1113
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:44,359
Just please go and get him
and bring him back.

1114
01:08:44,359 --> 01:08:46,680
Just get in
and get out.

1115
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:49,920
Pick him up, bring him back,
do not talk. Got it.

1116
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:56,199
Hey, buddy.

1117
01:08:56,199 --> 01:08:58,800
Your mom asked me
to come and get you.

1118
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:00,680
Okay.

1119
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:05,159
Are you here
for Alexander?

1120
01:09:05,159 --> 01:09:06,319
Yes, Alex.

1121
01:09:06,319 --> 01:09:09,079
- Oh, you must be the brother.
- Correct.

1122
01:09:09,079 --> 01:09:12,239
Oh, I was expecting
to see her today.

1123
01:09:12,239 --> 01:09:13,760
Today is
conference day.

1124
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:16,000
She had a medical
emergency.

1125
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,159
So I'm just gonna
take Alex home now.

1126
01:09:17,159 --> 01:09:18,880
See, I'm afraid
that could affect

1127
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:21,279
Alexander getting into
the advanced program.

1128
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:24,720
Oh, well, you could
just tell me.

1129
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:26,079
After all,
I'm her brother.

1130
01:09:26,079 --> 01:09:27,960
Fine. Okay.

1131
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:30,479
- This will just take a minute.
- Okay.

1132
01:09:30,479 --> 01:09:32,800
Okay, well,
come on in.

1133
01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:36,239
Shit.

1134
01:09:38,159 --> 01:09:40,079
Where are my...?

1135
01:09:40,079 --> 01:09:42,000
If you would...

1136
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,920
That's nice.

1137
01:09:57,760 --> 01:09:59,039
I don't believe
we've met.

1138
01:10:01,159 --> 01:10:02,760
I'm Zebulon.

1139
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:06,239
Uncle Zebulon.

1140
01:10:06,239 --> 01:10:08,520
Ta-dah!

1141
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:10,880
Well, Alexander...

1142
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:13,760
First let me say what a joy
he is to have in class.

1143
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:15,680
He's a very
creative child

1144
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:17,159
and he makes friends
with everyone.

1145
01:10:17,159 --> 01:10:19,720
If one of the other students
is hurt or upset,

1146
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:22,640
Alexander's always the first
one to show them comfort.

1147
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:25,279
He's quite empathetic.

1148
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:27,520
And empathetic is good.

1149
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:29,840
- Great.
- But in some of the other areas...

1150
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:32,479
Empathy, reading,
friendship... what else is there?

1151
01:10:32,479 --> 01:10:34,560
Well, math.

1152
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:36,399
He's far behind
the other students.

1153
01:10:36,399 --> 01:10:38,039
He still struggles
with arithmetic

1154
01:10:38,039 --> 01:10:41,159
while the other students
have moved on to multiplication.

1155
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:45,079
Well, you're the teacher.
Aren't you supposed to be able

1156
01:10:45,079 --> 01:10:47,439
to find a way
to teach it to him?

1157
01:10:50,239 --> 01:10:52,039
I have 26 students.

1158
01:10:52,039 --> 01:10:55,119
I can't devote all of my
time to one student.

1159
01:10:55,119 --> 01:10:56,840
And Alexander
still needs to learn

1160
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:59,119
our very first lesson.

1161
01:11:02,239 --> 01:11:05,479
And he's also...
oh, how do I say this?

1162
01:11:07,279 --> 01:11:10,000
Well, immature.

1163
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,760
He's seven.

1164
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:14,079
Yes, but he still jokes

1165
01:11:14,079 --> 01:11:15,680
with his seatmates
during a lesson

1166
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:18,840
and sometimes while
we're trying to have peaceful time.

1167
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:21,239
The other students still have to learn
all the same lessons,

1168
01:11:21,239 --> 01:11:24,399
and Alexander often
makes this difficult.

1169
01:11:24,399 --> 01:11:25,920
I think if Alexander's
really going to thrive...

1170
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:27,039
Let me stop you right there.

1171
01:11:27,039 --> 01:11:28,920
I'm gonna tell you
a couple of things.

1172
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:31,800
All kids develop
in different ways

1173
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:34,600
at different times and
in different directions.

1174
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:37,640
Now I am confident
that Alex at some point

1175
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:40,920
will be able to tell time
and make change,

1176
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:43,720
which, let's face it,
just about covers it.

1177
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:46,640
I don't think
you're hearing me.

1178
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:49,239
What I am hearing
is that Alex is not a good candidate

1179
01:11:49,239 --> 01:11:52,560
to be a robot
in your clone army.

1180
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:54,119
Zebulon...

1181
01:11:54,119 --> 01:11:56,039
We're gonna work
on the math, okay?

1182
01:11:56,039 --> 01:11:58,119
In the meantime, why
don't you try not making him feel

1183
01:11:58,119 --> 01:12:00,560
like being who he is
is the problem?

1184
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:04,079
That's what happened
to you and me, remember?

1185
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:07,880
Oh, and by the way,
his name is Alex.

1186
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:11,319
He fucking hates
"Alexander."

1187
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:17,720
Am I in trouble?

1188
01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:19,359
I think we got her
right where we want her.

1189
01:12:19,359 --> 01:12:21,119
She says you're a great kid,

1190
01:12:21,119 --> 01:12:23,359
but maybe you could not
tell jokes while she's talking.

1191
01:12:23,359 --> 01:12:25,439
- Okay.
- Oh, and by the way,

1192
01:12:25,439 --> 01:12:28,199
If she asks...
I'm your uncle.

1193
01:12:28,199 --> 01:12:30,439
My name is Zebulon.
Zebulon...

1194
01:12:30,439 --> 01:12:33,000
A Hebrew name,
means "exalted."

1195
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:37,520
What's up?

1196
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:39,800
My mom says
that meat is poisonous

1197
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:42,119
And it can
make you sick.

1198
01:12:42,119 --> 01:12:44,079
And I say

1199
01:12:44,079 --> 01:12:46,000
if that's not
the best hamburger

1200
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,920
you have ever had
in your life,

1201
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:49,840
I'll change my name
to Denise

1202
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:51,800
and run into the sea.

1203
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:53,760
Okay.

1204
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:00,880
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

1205
01:13:27,439 --> 01:13:29,359
This is a nice piano.

1206
01:13:29,359 --> 01:13:32,000
Yes, it is.

1207
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,399
- Can you play it?
- A little.

1208
01:13:34,399 --> 01:13:36,399
Will you play me
something?

1209
01:13:36,399 --> 01:13:38,079
No, I don't want to.

1210
01:13:38,079 --> 01:13:40,520
How come?

1211
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:43,920
Well, it was my father's
and he died

1212
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:46,720
and playing it
reminds me of him.

1213
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:48,600
Was he nice?

1214
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:51,319
Yes, he was.

1215
01:13:51,319 --> 01:13:52,880
Do you miss him?

1216
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:54,640
Very much.

1217
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:56,920
Yes, I do.

1218
01:13:56,920 --> 01:13:58,680
Me too.

1219
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,319
- Can I ask you a question?
- Mm-hmm.

1220
01:14:05,239 --> 01:14:07,720
How long is two weeks?

1221
01:14:13,279 --> 01:14:15,199
It's okay.
I don't know either.

1222
01:14:25,399 --> 01:14:27,319
Hi.
Hi, buddy.

1223
01:14:27,319 --> 01:14:29,079
Oh, a big hug.

1224
01:14:29,079 --> 01:14:32,159
Thanks for watching him.
It won't happen again.

1225
01:14:32,159 --> 01:14:33,640
No problem, really.

1226
01:14:33,640 --> 01:14:35,119
- Bye, Arlen.
- Bye.

1227
01:14:35,119 --> 01:14:36,920
Sorry for the imposition.

1228
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:39,359
We had a good time.

1229
01:14:39,359 --> 01:14:41,920
- Elizabeth.
- Yeah?

1230
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:44,800
Nothing.

1231
01:14:51,119 --> 01:14:53,199
Come on, you.
Did you have fun?

1232
01:14:53,199 --> 01:14:55,760
Hamburgers?

1233
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:58,079
Who thought that was
a good idea?

1234
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:29,880
Kris.

1235
01:15:32,319 --> 01:15:34,640
- Kris, are you there?
- Go away.

1236
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:55,640
What's up
with the bottle?

1237
01:15:55,640 --> 01:15:59,479
My dad's funeral
was today.

1238
01:15:59,479 --> 01:16:01,399
I was the only person
that knew.

1239
01:16:01,399 --> 01:16:04,279
Oh, well, I'm sure
there were some people

1240
01:16:04,279 --> 01:16:05,840
who couldn't make it,
you know.

1241
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:07,560
No.

1242
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:09,960
You said everyone's life

1243
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:12,359
is either moving toward
or away from a purpose.

1244
01:16:12,359 --> 01:16:15,359
Maybe my purpose
is to drink.

1245
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:20,600
That's not what I meant.

1246
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:24,960
When I came to you,
I really thought you could help me.

1247
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:26,920
And you know what?
You did.

1248
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:30,199
You helped me realize that
all my worst fears are true.

1249
01:16:30,199 --> 01:16:32,640
I mean, you had
the man on the phone,

1250
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:36,479
and this is
what it did for you.

1251
01:16:41,119 --> 01:16:43,199
So I may as well
go ahead and drink.

1252
01:16:43,199 --> 01:16:46,319
That's not what I meant.

1253
01:16:48,359 --> 01:16:51,159
Congratulations, Arlen.

1254
01:16:51,159 --> 01:16:52,840
You can have
your life back now.

1255
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:54,800
Isn't that
what you want?

1256
01:16:58,079 --> 01:17:00,079
Get out.

1257
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:33,960
- Hello.
- Hello, Arlen,

1258
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:36,560
or should I say Zebulon?

1259
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:38,359
It means "exalted."
do you want...?

1260
01:17:38,359 --> 01:17:43,039
I can't believe I forgot
about the conference.

1261
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:44,399
Lucky for you,
I was there.

1262
01:17:44,399 --> 01:17:46,279
What did you say to her?

1263
01:17:46,279 --> 01:17:48,760
Nothing.

1264
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:51,720
"Kids develop," you know,
"friendship, reading,"

1265
01:17:51,720 --> 01:17:53,560
maybe something
about robots.

1266
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:55,600
Arlen, Mrs. Gold
called me and said

1267
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:58,039
that she wants to recommend
Alex for the advanced program.

1268
01:17:58,039 --> 01:18:01,199
Oh, well, that's
totally amazing.

1269
01:18:01,199 --> 01:18:04,479
Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

1270
01:18:04,479 --> 01:18:06,359
Just when I give up
on you...

1271
01:18:06,359 --> 01:18:08,880
Yeah, a program
of advanced what?

1272
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:10,800
Placement in learning.

1273
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:12,199
- Learning what?
- I don't know what you mean.

1274
01:18:12,199 --> 01:18:16,279
I mean, Mrs. Gold is kind of an
uptight little control weasel,

1275
01:18:16,279 --> 01:18:19,640
And I think that school
you love so much is bullshit.

1276
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:23,439
I would keep my kid far
away from people like that.

1277
01:18:23,439 --> 01:18:24,880
What that kid needs
is confidence.

1278
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:29,479
I'm sorry, when did this go from me
thanking you to you attacking me?

1279
01:18:29,479 --> 01:18:32,000
I'm sorry.
You're welcome.

1280
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,680
I'm glad you got
what you wanted.

1281
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:36,640
Are you saying Alex
doesn't have any confidence?

1282
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:39,279
I'm saying he's
just a little guy.

1283
01:18:39,279 --> 01:18:41,279
And all that pressure
is gonna fuck him up

1284
01:18:41,279 --> 01:18:42,880
or turn him into
a salesman of some kind.

1285
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:46,319
I'm sorry, when did you become
an expert in child raising?

1286
01:18:46,319 --> 01:18:49,560
I'm not the one who straps
him into some death harness

1287
01:18:49,560 --> 01:18:51,000
and then buys
pretend food

1288
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,840
that's supposed to be
better than the real thing.

1289
01:18:54,239 --> 01:18:57,760
You're trying to turn him
into your idea of who he should be

1290
01:18:57,760 --> 01:19:00,319
instead of looking at
who he is, and that's...

1291
01:19:00,319 --> 01:19:03,640
Who are you to judge me?
Alex is everything to me

1292
01:19:03,640 --> 01:19:05,479
and I want to give him
the very best.

1293
01:19:05,479 --> 01:19:07,640
While you're giving him
your best,

1294
01:19:07,640 --> 01:19:09,279
you might want to tell him
his dad's not coming back.

1295
01:19:13,399 --> 01:19:15,439
What did you
say to him?

1296
01:19:17,319 --> 01:19:19,640
What did you
say to him?

1297
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:22,359
Nothing. He asked me
how long two weeks was.

1298
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:26,039
I didn't say anything.

1299
01:19:26,039 --> 01:19:27,960
Look, he knows the truth,

1300
01:19:27,960 --> 01:19:30,079
but he needs
to hear it from you.

1301
01:19:30,079 --> 01:19:33,520
Let me guess,
God told you that.

1302
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:36,279
He said, "They're having
a rough time, Arlen.

1303
01:19:36,279 --> 01:19:38,600
You should go
and help them."

1304
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:41,720
No? Of course not.
Because you don't want to help anybody.

1305
01:19:41,720 --> 01:19:43,920
You don't want to know anybody.
You just want to sit in here

1306
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:45,520
and hide and watch while the rest
of us try to work it out.

1307
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:47,840
It must be hilarious.

1308
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:49,479
It's not like that.

1309
01:19:49,479 --> 01:19:51,760
You know, I feel
more alone now

1310
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:53,399
than I did
before we met.

1311
01:21:29,079 --> 01:21:31,159
Excuse me.

1312
01:21:41,720 --> 01:21:44,159
Hi.

1313
01:21:44,159 --> 01:21:46,720
You must be Kris.

1314
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:48,640
I'm Terry...

1315
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:51,319
Terry Fraser,
Arlen's agent.

1316
01:21:51,319 --> 01:21:53,239
How did you do it?

1317
01:21:53,239 --> 01:21:55,359
Wait, I don't want to know.
I don't care.

1318
01:21:57,199 --> 01:21:59,800
- What's going on?
- You don't know?

1319
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:02,920
Arlen is coming here to speak for
the 20th-anniversary of "Me and God."

1320
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:05,560
It's a miracle. He phoned me
and told me to get the books over here,

1321
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:09,680
said he's already sent word
to all of the websites... all of them.

1322
01:22:09,680 --> 01:22:12,000
Get over here.

1323
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,520
What's going on?

1324
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:17,079
ThatTerry lady came in this morningg
with all these boxes of books

1325
01:22:17,079 --> 01:22:19,279
And said that your
pal Arlen is speaking here today

1326
01:22:19,279 --> 01:22:20,600
and we'd better
get busy.

1327
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:22,720
We don't have any money
to buy books.

1328
01:22:22,720 --> 01:22:24,479
Kris, it was a gift.

1329
01:22:28,079 --> 01:22:29,880
- Where is he?
- He's coming.

1330
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:32,560
No, Kris.
Who's gonna help me...?

1331
01:22:35,199 --> 01:22:36,319
Hi, you guys.

1332
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:44,760
I'll be with you in one minute.

1333
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:46,640
There you go.
Just fill that out.

1334
01:22:46,640 --> 01:22:47,960
We'll get to all of you,
I promise.

1335
01:22:52,359 --> 01:22:55,479
- What are you doing right now?
- We're kind of busy.

1336
01:22:55,479 --> 01:22:58,520
Arlen's going to speak
at the bookstore.

1337
01:23:01,279 --> 01:23:04,479
- Arlen who?
- Arlen Faber.

1338
01:23:12,760 --> 01:23:14,159
There he is.

1339
01:23:17,960 --> 01:23:21,159
- I love your book, Arlen.
- You rock, Arlen.

1340
01:23:21,159 --> 01:23:22,760
ladies and gentlemen, this is

1341
01:23:22,760 --> 01:23:25,119
a very special occasion
for all of us,

1342
01:23:25,119 --> 01:23:29,920
something that we have
waited for for 20 years.

1343
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:31,920
The author
of "Me and God,"

1344
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:34,880
the man who showed us
a glimpse of heaven...

1345
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:36,960
Arlen Faber.

1346
01:23:44,439 --> 01:23:46,359
Thank you, Terry.
You were right.

1347
01:23:46,359 --> 01:23:48,279
I should have done this
a long time ago.

1348
01:23:48,279 --> 01:23:51,159
Thank you for coming.

1349
01:23:51,159 --> 01:23:53,239
I would also like
to thank

1350
01:23:53,239 --> 01:23:55,520
Kris Lucas
and "Book Trader"

1351
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:57,520
for allowing me
to use their store today.

1352
01:23:57,520 --> 01:24:00,000
This is the best bookstore
in Philadelphia.

1353
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,920
Whoo!

1354
01:24:03,560 --> 01:24:07,239
Now those of you
who liked the book,

1355
01:24:07,239 --> 01:24:10,039
one person had
the insight to see

1356
01:24:10,039 --> 01:24:12,720
that this book might be
useful to people... one...

1357
01:24:12,720 --> 01:24:14,960
Terry Fraser.

1358
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:17,239
Terry is the one person

1359
01:24:17,239 --> 01:24:20,000
who saw the value there.

1360
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,319
All right, now I came here
to tell you something,

1361
01:24:22,319 --> 01:24:24,720
so just hold your applause
until the end, all right?

1362
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:28,560
Now I know
many of you have questions.

1363
01:24:38,199 --> 01:24:39,960
I can't talk to God.

1364
01:24:48,159 --> 01:24:51,640
Here's the deal...

1365
01:24:51,640 --> 01:24:53,560
A little over
20 years ago

1366
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:55,479
I found out that my father
had an illness.

1367
01:24:55,479 --> 01:24:58,920
Everything he had
and everything that we did together

1368
01:24:58,920 --> 01:25:02,359
would be taken from him
one memory at a time.

1369
01:25:02,359 --> 01:25:04,359
Now I got this news

1370
01:25:04,359 --> 01:25:07,000
and I begged for help
from, you know, whomever.

1371
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,720
I pleaded...

1372
01:25:09,720 --> 01:25:12,760
Nothing.

1373
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:15,840
I had questions.
I wanted answers,

1374
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:17,760
needed them.

1375
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:21,279
You know
what it's like.

1376
01:25:21,279 --> 01:25:24,520
Well, guess what happened.

1377
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:26,439
I didn't get them.

1378
01:25:26,439 --> 01:25:28,359
And it really
pissed me off.

1379
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:35,399
So one day

1380
01:25:35,399 --> 01:25:38,600
I started to write
the questions down.

1381
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:42,439
And then some answers
to those questions came to me

1382
01:25:42,439 --> 01:25:46,239
and I wrote
them down too.

1383
01:25:46,239 --> 01:25:49,239
Before I knew it,
I had all these pages.

1384
01:25:49,239 --> 01:25:52,840
One thing led to another

1385
01:25:52,840 --> 01:25:54,880
And that's how
"Me and God" came to be.

1386
01:25:57,880 --> 01:26:00,760
That's it.

1387
01:26:00,760 --> 01:26:05,159
I didn't even really think
that much of it at the time.

1388
01:26:07,199 --> 01:26:10,359
I wish it were
more amazing than that, I really do.

1389
01:26:10,359 --> 01:26:12,640
Are you saying
you made it all up?

1390
01:26:15,159 --> 01:26:17,319
I don't know.

1391
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:20,920
Maybe.

1392
01:26:20,920 --> 01:26:25,000
Maybe whoever's up there
just used my anger and pain

1393
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,640
to make me part
of some divine plan.

1394
01:26:30,319 --> 01:26:33,680
And if he did, he sure as
hell didn't let me in on it.

1395
01:26:37,239 --> 01:26:41,199
I'm not
a guy with answers.

1396
01:26:51,399 --> 01:26:53,319
I'm just a guy

1397
01:26:53,319 --> 01:26:55,640
who recently crawled back
to civilization

1398
01:26:55,640 --> 01:26:58,760
on all fours.

1399
01:27:03,199 --> 01:27:05,520
Hang on, so all those
questions...

1400
01:27:08,680 --> 01:27:10,880
The best advice I had at the time,
and I meant every word.

1401
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:13,039
I'm sorry,
I have to go now.

1402
01:27:13,039 --> 01:27:14,600
So you're just like
the rest of us.

1403
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:17,600
Not yet,
but I'm trying.

1404
01:27:21,880 --> 01:27:23,800
Oh, God.

1405
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:26,760
Stop following me.

1406
01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:29,079
Stop, will you,
just for a minute?

1407
01:27:29,079 --> 01:27:30,199
This is dumb.

1408
01:27:30,199 --> 01:27:32,840
You're right.
This is dumb.

1409
01:27:32,840 --> 01:27:36,199
Look, you're complicated
and confusing.

1410
01:27:36,199 --> 01:27:38,800
Alex and I
don't need that

1411
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:40,199
- in our lives right now.
- Yes, you do.

1412
01:27:40,199 --> 01:27:41,640
- No.
- Listen, you can leave...

1413
01:27:41,640 --> 01:27:44,439
No, you'll just
make something up. And I know...

1414
01:27:44,439 --> 01:27:46,920
Shut up, Elizabeth.
Look, everything I said was true, okay?

1415
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:50,079
It just didn't come
from some invisible super being.

1416
01:27:50,079 --> 01:27:52,920
It came from me... me.

1417
01:27:55,479 --> 01:27:58,359
What do you want me to say,
"It's okay that you lied"?

1418
01:27:58,359 --> 01:28:00,479
You want me
to fall in your arms

1419
01:28:00,479 --> 01:28:02,479
and say,
"All is forgiven"?

1420
01:28:02,479 --> 01:28:05,159
I understand,
all right?

1421
01:28:05,159 --> 01:28:07,800
You were protecting
yourself and you freaked out.

1422
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:10,760
Happens to
the best of us.

1423
01:28:10,760 --> 01:28:13,279
Let's just leave it
at that.

1424
01:28:13,279 --> 01:28:16,119
That's not good enough.

1425
01:28:18,279 --> 01:28:20,920
Yes, I lied.
Yes, I'm sorry.

1426
01:28:20,920 --> 01:28:22,880
Yes, I led you on.
Yes to all of it.

1427
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:26,960
But just so you know,

1428
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:30,520
the answer to every
questions I ever had

1429
01:28:30,520 --> 01:28:32,840
is a kid like Alex who's got a mom
like you.

1430
01:28:57,079 --> 01:29:01,159
If we could maybe
just start again,

1431
01:29:01,159 --> 01:29:03,079
I think this might
end better.

1432
01:29:08,319 --> 01:29:10,600
Maybe it would.

1433
01:29:19,479 --> 01:29:20,800
Elizabeth.

1434
01:29:23,960 --> 01:29:25,239
I'm Arlen.

1435
01:30:15,119 --> 01:30:17,039
# You can cry #

1436
01:30:17,039 --> 01:30:19,399
# a million tears #

1437
01:30:19,399 --> 01:30:21,319
# you can wait #

1438
01:30:21,319 --> 01:30:23,199
# a million years #

1439
01:30:23,199 --> 01:30:26,159
# if you think that time #

1440
01:30:26,159 --> 01:30:28,399
# will change your ways #

1441
01:30:28,399 --> 01:30:31,840
# don't wait too long #

1442
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:34,439
# when your morning #

1443
01:30:34,439 --> 01:30:36,359
# turns to night #

1444
01:30:36,359 --> 01:30:38,600
# who'll be loving you #

1445
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:40,520
# by candlelight? #

1446
01:30:40,520 --> 01:30:43,479
# if you think that time #

1447
01:30:43,479 --> 01:30:45,680
# will change your ways #

1448
01:30:45,680 --> 01:30:49,479
# don't wait too long #

1449
01:30:49,479 --> 01:30:51,399
# maybe I've got #

1450
01:30:51,399 --> 01:30:53,840
# a lot to learn #

1451
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:56,560
# time can slip away #

1452
01:30:57,720 --> 01:30:59,800
# sometimes #

1453
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:02,680
# you've gotta
lose it all #

1454
01:31:02,680 --> 01:31:05,319
# before you find
your way #

1455
01:31:07,079 --> 01:31:09,079
# take a chance #

1456
01:31:09,079 --> 01:31:11,319
# and play your part #

1457
01:31:11,319 --> 01:31:13,760
# make romance #

1458
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:16,119
# it might
break your heart #

1459
01:31:16,119 --> 01:31:18,479
# but if you think
that time #

1460
01:31:18,479 --> 01:31:20,560
# will change your ways #

1461
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:23,760
# don't wait too long #

1462
01:31:41,479 --> 01:31:43,840
# it may rain #

1463
01:31:43,840 --> 01:31:46,279
# it may shine #

1464
01:31:46,279 --> 01:31:48,399
# love may age #

1465
01:31:48,399 --> 01:31:50,680
# like fine red wine #

1466
01:31:50,680 --> 01:31:53,560
# but if you think
that time #

1467
01:31:53,560 --> 01:31:55,800

1470
01:32:01,720 --> 01:32:04,119
# got a lot to learn #

1471
01:32:04,119 --> 01:32:06,760
# don't want to waste
another day #

1472
01:32:08,319 --> 01:32:12,760
# maybe you've gotta

1473
01:32:12,760 --> 01:32:16,600
