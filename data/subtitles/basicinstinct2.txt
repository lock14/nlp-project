1
00:01:52,324 --> 00:01:53,985
Guess what.

2
00:01:54,193 --> 00:01:55,820
What?

3
00:01:57,162 --> 00:01:58,959
I can't move.

4
00:02:00,266 --> 00:02:04,225
Yeah, well, you don't have to.
You're in a car.

5
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:12,035
Am I driving?

6
00:02:13,613 --> 00:02:15,171
Like a pro.

7
00:04:05,698 --> 00:04:08,861
Come on, wake up, you fuck.
Come on.

8
00:05:17,074 --> 00:05:19,372
Did you try to help him get free?

9
00:05:21,345 --> 00:05:23,006
Briefly.

10
00:05:23,214 --> 00:05:24,613
Briefly?

11
00:05:24,815 --> 00:05:29,912
When it came down to it, my life
was more important to me than his.

12
00:05:31,655 --> 00:05:33,384
Selfish, huh?

13
00:05:38,663 --> 00:05:40,961
We found these...

14
00:05:43,068 --> 00:05:46,299
...in your Spider.

15
00:05:46,505 --> 00:05:49,440
Actually, I don't drive a Spider anymore.

16
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:52,007
Now I have a C8 Laviolette.

17
00:05:52,211 --> 00:05:54,270
It's lighter, faster...

18
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,380
...swims better.

19
00:06:18,772 --> 00:06:20,137
Right.

20
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:23,002
These three contain traces of ketamine...

21
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:26,111
...the same as we found in your blood and his.

22
00:06:26,314 --> 00:06:31,513
This one had pure D-Tubocurarine,
DTC...

23
00:06:31,719 --> 00:06:34,381
...which we only found in him.

24
00:06:34,923 --> 00:06:37,619
Must've been something he took at the party.

25
00:06:37,825 --> 00:06:40,316
No. DTC is not a party drug.

26
00:06:40,528 --> 00:06:43,861
Along with the other stuff in his
blood, it paralyzed his lungs.

27
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:46,326
Kevin Franks did not drown.

28
00:06:46,535 --> 00:06:51,370
He had already stopped breathing
by the time you drove off the road.

29
00:06:51,574 --> 00:06:53,667
He was breathing when we went off the road.

30
00:06:53,876 --> 00:06:54,865
How do you know?

31
00:06:55,077 --> 00:06:56,442
He was making me come.

32
00:06:57,846 --> 00:07:01,976
What? You were having sex
at 100 miles an hour?

33
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,119
Hundred and ten.
I must've hit a pothole.

34
00:07:07,424 --> 00:07:09,688
Your friend, Dickie Pep...

35
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:14,556
...says he sold you 15 milliliters
of DTC last Thursday.

36
00:07:14,764 --> 00:07:18,461
I don't know any Dickie Pep, but he's lying.

37
00:07:18,669 --> 00:07:19,693
Or you are.

38
00:07:19,937 --> 00:07:20,904
Why would he lie?

39
00:07:21,105 --> 00:07:24,632
You got him on some other charge
and he's trying to deal his way out.

40
00:07:24,842 --> 00:07:26,173
If he even exists.

41
00:07:29,614 --> 00:07:33,015
You don't seem too upset by what's happened.

42
00:07:33,218 --> 00:07:35,448
Of course I am, I'm traumatized.

43
00:07:37,756 --> 00:07:40,384
Who knows if I'll ever come again?

44
00:07:43,829 --> 00:07:45,820
I want that cunt in jail.

45
00:07:46,031 --> 00:07:47,828
We haven't got a case, Roy.

46
00:07:48,033 --> 00:07:52,129
Well, just fucking make one. Please.

47
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:54,898
They'll order a psychiatric for bail.

48
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:57,941
I'll make sure we get somebody good and tough.

49
00:08:21,568 --> 00:08:26,062
Dr. Glass. I'm Henry Rose,
Miss Tramell's solicitor.

50
00:08:26,274 --> 00:08:28,504
This is Catherine Tramell.

51
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:31,740
I shall be present during the evaluation.

52
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:34,109
Well, that's fine by me.

53
00:08:34,315 --> 00:08:38,684
I'll be asking fairly personal questions.
If she doesn't mind your presence...

54
00:08:38,887 --> 00:08:42,186
My client understands and agrees
I should be present for...

55
00:08:42,391 --> 00:08:45,417
Maybe Dr. Glass is right
and we should be alone for this.

56
00:08:45,628 --> 00:08:48,529
I strongly advise you
not to contemplate having...

57
00:08:48,731 --> 00:08:51,393
So is this where we're going to do it?

58
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:09,978
Mr. Rose told you the purpose
of this evaluation.

59
00:09:10,187 --> 00:09:12,553
I'm applying for bail in a murder case.

60
00:09:12,756 --> 00:09:16,590
The Crown wants to know
if I'm a danger to myself or others.

61
00:09:16,794 --> 00:09:19,854
You're the Crown's shrink,
so you'll say I'm dangerous.

62
00:09:20,064 --> 00:09:23,124
My shrink will say I'm not,
and the judge will flip a coin.

63
00:09:24,535 --> 00:09:27,868
Anything you tell me can be quoted
verbatim in testimony...

64
00:09:28,072 --> 00:09:29,369
...and can affect your case.

65
00:09:29,574 --> 00:09:31,201
You can quote me all you want.

66
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:32,377
Thank you.

67
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,110
Well, I see that you're a writer.

68
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:40,142
What do you write about?

69
00:09:40,352 --> 00:09:43,082
Murder, sex, violence.

70
00:09:43,288 --> 00:09:45,518
Do you ever write about yourself?

71
00:09:45,724 --> 00:09:47,692
Not into autobiography.

72
00:09:47,893 --> 00:09:49,224
Really? Why not?

73
00:09:49,429 --> 00:09:53,661
Maybe I like to just sit back and get
other people to reveal themselves.

74
00:09:56,503 --> 00:09:59,336
For instance, you look a little divorced.

75
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,966
What makes you think I'm divorced?

76
00:10:02,175 --> 00:10:04,268
The ring line hasn't faded.

77
00:10:07,414 --> 00:10:08,938
You're very observant.

78
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,050
Yeah, but am I wrong?

79
00:10:11,318 --> 00:10:13,411
Would it bother you if you were wrong?

80
00:10:13,621 --> 00:10:15,782
Would it bother you if I was right?

81
00:10:20,861 --> 00:10:23,887
Tell me something you're afraid of.

82
00:10:28,937 --> 00:10:30,063
Boredom.

83
00:10:30,272 --> 00:10:32,103
Is that why you like to take risks?

84
00:10:33,108 --> 00:10:35,372
I do like to take risks.

85
00:10:35,577 --> 00:10:38,876
Like taking drugs and having sex
in a speeding car?

86
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:42,106
Like talking to me
without having your lawyer present?

87
00:10:43,553 --> 00:10:46,021
Actually, that was your idea.

88
00:10:46,222 --> 00:10:50,420
Like being on trial for murder? That's
risky. You could end up in prison.

89
00:10:50,626 --> 00:10:51,684
Not if I'm innocent.

90
00:10:51,894 --> 00:10:54,294
Innocent people end up in prison all the time.

91
00:10:54,497 --> 00:10:58,092
Not rich, innocent people who are
represented by Henry Rose.

92
00:10:58,302 --> 00:11:01,533
In that case, it isn't really exciting
unless you're guilty.

93
00:11:05,108 --> 00:11:09,704
Oh, I bet you like to take risks,
don't you, Dr. Glass?

94
00:11:09,913 --> 00:11:12,438
But I'm not the one who's on trial for murder.

95
00:11:12,649 --> 00:11:14,082
Not yet.

96
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:23,219
Sorry, you're not allowed to smoke in here.

97
00:11:31,003 --> 00:11:33,437
You know what I like about you?

98
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:36,437
You enjoy being in control.

99
00:11:42,548 --> 00:11:44,038
Like me.

100
00:11:58,665 --> 00:12:01,065
Sorry, sir. Can't let you through here.

101
00:12:02,235 --> 00:12:06,535
Well, I would say extremely intelligent.
Gifted, accomplished.

102
00:12:06,741 --> 00:12:08,038
Yet inside, I believe...

103
00:12:08,242 --> 00:12:11,837
...she vacillates between
a feeling of godlike omnipotence...

104
00:12:12,046 --> 00:12:14,844
...and a sense that she simply doesn't exist...

105
00:12:15,049 --> 00:12:17,244
...which, of course, is intolerable.

106
00:12:17,451 --> 00:12:21,285
Do you consider Miss Tramell to be
mentally impaired?

107
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:24,425
Not by legal definition, no. Not at all.

108
00:12:24,626 --> 00:12:29,063
If released, is she likely
to commit a violent crime?

109
00:12:30,432 --> 00:12:34,232
I believe her behavior is driven
by what we call a risk addiction.

110
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:38,137
A compulsive need to prove to herself
that she can take risks...

111
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:40,366
...and survive dangers others can't.

112
00:12:40,576 --> 00:12:45,570
Especially the subsequent encounters
with the police or the powers that be.

113
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,573
Why would a person do that?

114
00:12:47,784 --> 00:12:51,481
The greater the risk, the greater the
proof of her omnipotence.

115
00:12:51,955 --> 00:12:53,946
Her existence, really.

116
00:12:54,157 --> 00:12:57,684
When you say she has a risk addiction...

117
00:12:57,895 --> 00:13:00,363
...is this condition likely to get worse?

118
00:13:00,564 --> 00:13:02,031
All addiction is progressive.

119
00:13:02,232 --> 00:13:04,792
The addict always needs to take greater risks.

120
00:13:05,002 --> 00:13:07,436
If other people are hurt or killed...

121
00:13:07,638 --> 00:13:11,005
...as a result of her behavior,
that's not likely to stop her?

122
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:13,733
I think the only thing that'd stop her...

123
00:13:18,016 --> 00:13:21,383
I suspect the only limit for her
would be her own death.

124
00:13:24,589 --> 00:13:27,114
Then she is a danger to herself.

125
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,423
Yes, I believe she is.

126
00:13:37,937 --> 00:13:40,371
Nice work, Michael. Well done.

127
00:13:42,141 --> 00:13:45,440
Dr. Glass, did Catherine Tramell
kill Kevin Franks?

128
00:13:45,644 --> 00:13:48,078
No, I can't make any comment, sorry.

129
00:13:48,281 --> 00:13:50,647
Can you please tell us about the bail?

130
00:13:52,619 --> 00:13:57,454
Dr. Michael Glass. What a big thing
you are all of a sudden.

131
00:13:57,657 --> 00:14:02,151
What are you doing here, Adam?
Don't say you're writing about Tramell.

132
00:14:02,362 --> 00:14:05,160
A sexy, omnipotent killer
with a Random House contract.

133
00:14:05,366 --> 00:14:06,492
Why would I write that?

134
00:14:06,701 --> 00:14:08,259
You don't know she's a killer.

135
00:14:08,469 --> 00:14:12,064
No, but I hope she is, though.
I mean, I pray to God she is.

136
00:14:12,273 --> 00:14:15,299
By the way, I hear you were brilliant in there.

137
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:18,673
You're so lucid sometimes, it's just disgusting.

138
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,041
You thought about daytime television?

139
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:24,777
Denise always says you were born
for the small screen.

140
00:14:24,987 --> 00:14:27,683
And how is my wife these days?
Having fun?

141
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:31,223
Ex-wife, Michael. Ex-wife.

142
00:14:31,427 --> 00:14:33,793
While we're chatting about killers...

143
00:14:33,996 --> 00:14:37,090
...is there any chance of talking about
George Cheslav?

144
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,200
Who told you about Cheslav?

145
00:14:39,402 --> 00:14:40,630
Denise?

146
00:14:40,837 --> 00:14:44,102
That's got to be any shrink's worst nightmare.

147
00:14:44,307 --> 00:14:47,367
A patient in your care suddenly runs amok...

148
00:14:47,577 --> 00:14:49,442
...beats his girlfriend to death
with a brick.

149
00:14:49,646 --> 00:14:52,308
That was seven years ago, why talk about it now?

150
00:14:52,515 --> 00:14:55,507
Not quite seven, actually.
Seven in July.

151
00:14:55,719 --> 00:15:00,679
But you talked to him twice a week.
He never indicated he'd harm the girl?

152
00:15:00,891 --> 00:15:03,325
I don't talk about my patients.

153
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:07,224
Cheslav's dead. Can't you talk
about them when they're dead?

154
00:15:07,431 --> 00:15:10,127
No, not even when they're dead.

155
00:15:38,397 --> 00:15:40,160
Michael, what are you doing here?

156
00:15:40,366 --> 00:15:43,699
What did you tell Adam Towers
about George Cheslav?

157
00:15:43,903 --> 00:15:45,336
Nothing.

158
00:15:46,773 --> 00:15:48,741
Can you give us a minute?

159
00:15:50,277 --> 00:15:51,869
He already knew.

160
00:15:54,781 --> 00:15:58,342
Really? Because he said you told him.

161
00:15:58,552 --> 00:16:00,645
No, all I said was...

162
00:16:00,854 --> 00:16:04,290
If he writes about that, if he puts it
on his magazine cover...

163
00:16:04,492 --> 00:16:06,483
He won't. You're just being paranoid.

164
00:16:06,694 --> 00:16:08,161
You didn't do anything wrong.

165
00:16:08,363 --> 00:16:12,697
Right. I didn't. I was treating a patient
that killed his pregnant girlfriend.

166
00:16:12,901 --> 00:16:15,802
End of story.
You make sure he gets that.

167
00:16:16,004 --> 00:16:17,369
Don't worry.

168
00:16:25,314 --> 00:16:27,908
I'm up for the Douglas Chair at the university.

169
00:16:28,117 --> 00:16:32,019
You know what that means to me.
Do you think this is going to help?

170
00:16:32,221 --> 00:16:33,984
I can't tell Adam what to write.

171
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:35,157
Why not?

172
00:16:35,357 --> 00:16:36,324
Don't be stupid.

173
00:16:36,526 --> 00:16:40,462
I think you're entitled to since you've
been fucking him for over a year.

174
00:16:40,664 --> 00:16:43,599
Do you think I didn't know when it started?

175
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,327
It's a pity you never asked yourself
why it started.

176
00:16:56,681 --> 00:16:59,548
How was the court case with the mystery writer?

177
00:16:59,784 --> 00:17:01,342
I hear she looks fabulous.

178
00:17:01,552 --> 00:17:05,386
Also very intelligent.
Pathological liar. Narcissistic.

179
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:07,888
Seductive, manipulative.

180
00:17:08,092 --> 00:17:10,219
Do you think she killed the footballer?

181
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:11,396
I have no idea.

182
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:14,623
Everything she does is so perfectly composed.

183
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:17,301
It's designed to confuse or confound you.

184
00:17:17,502 --> 00:17:21,598
You never know what's truth
and what isn't. She's brilliant, really.

185
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:23,832
The masked psychotic. Your favorite.

186
00:17:24,042 --> 00:17:27,500
I'm already working it into a paper:
"Risk Addiction and Omnipotence."

187
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:28,976
You're writing another already?

188
00:17:29,182 --> 00:17:31,514
I'm writing two, but this
is the more interesting.

189
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:33,413
I'll catch you up.

190
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:34,917
Hello?

191
00:17:35,121 --> 00:17:38,716
Glass? It's Roy Washburn.
Are you near a television set?

192
00:17:38,925 --> 00:17:41,689
If you'll be quiet, I'll make a statement.

193
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:42,861
What happened?

194
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,324
The judge let her go.

195
00:17:44,598 --> 00:17:45,587
Let her go? Why?

196
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:48,063
The guy who said he sold her the DTC...

197
00:17:48,269 --> 00:17:51,363
...the judge found out he'd perjured
himself in another case...

198
00:17:51,572 --> 00:17:55,303
...and disqualified him as a witness.
But I'll make you a bet.

199
00:17:55,509 --> 00:17:56,498
What's that?

200
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:57,972
She'll do it again.

201
00:17:58,178 --> 00:17:59,270
And soon.

202
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:03,473
Only this time I will fucking nail the bitch.

203
00:18:21,337 --> 00:18:25,603
So we've been considering those who
wish to control others...

204
00:18:25,808 --> 00:18:28,902
...through their insecurity and their
narcissism.

205
00:18:29,111 --> 00:18:33,548
To study Nietzsche
psycho-biographically may seem naive.

206
00:18:33,749 --> 00:18:36,149
Wasn't it Nietzsche's work itself, which...

207
00:18:36,353 --> 00:18:39,413
...through deconstructive and
post-structuralist readings...

208
00:18:39,623 --> 00:18:42,148
...induced the death of
psycho-biography?

209
00:18:46,596 --> 00:18:51,465
Paul Portman said he might go
to Tavistock. I'm thinking I might go.

210
00:18:51,668 --> 00:18:55,126
Just be patient.
Stay where you are for about a year.

211
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:58,036
- But there's nothing holding me.
- Trust me.

212
00:18:58,242 --> 00:18:59,470
You know Dr. Gerst?

213
00:18:59,877 --> 00:19:01,572
Michael Glass.

214
00:19:01,779 --> 00:19:03,542
It's a pleasure.

215
00:19:03,881 --> 00:19:06,145
I saw your review of my book.

216
00:19:06,351 --> 00:19:10,048
You didn't understand what I was
saying about the analytic field.

217
00:19:10,255 --> 00:19:14,419
Towards the end you made one or two
interesting remarks.

218
00:19:14,626 --> 00:19:17,322
Maybe one of these days we can discuss it.

219
00:19:17,763 --> 00:19:20,061
I'd be honored. Thank you very much.

220
00:19:22,267 --> 00:19:24,462
"One or two interesting remarks"?

221
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:28,902
That was a compliment, Michelle.
Dr. Gerst was very impressed.

222
00:19:29,109 --> 00:19:32,476
And it appears that our Michael
has just been knighted.

223
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,942
Cheers.

224
00:19:36,883 --> 00:19:38,612
Congratulations.

225
00:20:19,823 --> 00:20:21,814
Excuse me. Dr. Glass?

226
00:20:22,026 --> 00:20:24,426
I'm Peter Ristedes.
Adam Towers' assistant.

227
00:20:24,862 --> 00:20:26,853
Urbane magazine.

228
00:20:29,099 --> 00:20:30,999
Mind if I join you?

229
00:20:31,202 --> 00:20:35,798
Adam asked me to see if you'd give us
a quote for the article he's writing.

230
00:20:36,007 --> 00:20:37,975
I believe he mentioned it to you.

231
00:20:39,277 --> 00:20:42,303
He didn't seem to think
you'd want to talk to him.

232
00:20:49,355 --> 00:20:51,915
I'll take that as a "no comment," then?

233
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:10,867
Dr. Glass?

234
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,213
Miss Tramell.

235
00:21:16,716 --> 00:21:18,047
What are you doing here?

236
00:21:18,518 --> 00:21:20,418
I wanted to talk to you.

237
00:21:20,621 --> 00:21:22,418
About the evaluation.

238
00:21:23,624 --> 00:21:27,958
Some of the things you said,
I've been thinking about them a lot.

239
00:21:30,465 --> 00:21:32,763
I'm sorry you had to hear all that.

240
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:37,702
Got a minute?

241
00:21:42,678 --> 00:21:44,111
Come through.

242
00:21:53,155 --> 00:21:58,422
What you said about me being addicted to risk...

243
00:21:58,628 --> 00:22:01,825
...about having to do more and more
dangerous things...

244
00:22:02,031 --> 00:22:05,330
Well, after you said it...

245
00:22:05,869 --> 00:22:08,269
...I realized I was...

246
00:22:08,471 --> 00:22:09,995
...scared.

247
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,769
What exactly scared you?

248
00:22:15,112 --> 00:22:19,481
For weeks before the accident
I was having the same...

249
00:22:20,784 --> 00:22:23,548
...fantasy over and over again.

250
00:22:24,889 --> 00:22:26,982
I even wrote about it.

251
00:22:27,191 --> 00:22:32,356
The woman's driving in the car,
the man's making her come.

252
00:22:32,564 --> 00:22:36,295
She drives off the road, the man's killed.

253
00:22:36,635 --> 00:22:40,071
I feel like maybe I made it all happen.

254
00:22:41,907 --> 00:22:43,772
That's why I'm here.

255
00:22:43,975 --> 00:22:46,876
Are you saying you'd like to go into treatment?

256
00:22:49,815 --> 00:22:50,873
Yeah.

257
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:53,483
Well, I think that's a very good idea.

258
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:58,950
I wouldn't be able to treat you, but I'd
be happy to refer you to a colleague.

259
00:22:59,158 --> 00:23:00,420
Why can't you treat me?

260
00:23:00,626 --> 00:23:04,084
It's not advisable for a doctor who's
done a forensic evaluation...

261
00:23:04,298 --> 00:23:06,266
...to then become that person's
therapist.

262
00:23:06,466 --> 00:23:07,433
Why not?

263
00:23:07,634 --> 00:23:12,071
Therapy requires a great deal of trust,
which is difficult for most people.

264
00:23:12,272 --> 00:23:15,002
It's best to start with a clean slate.

265
00:23:15,209 --> 00:23:17,700
You mean you don't trust me.

266
00:23:20,682 --> 00:23:24,482
What I said about you at the hearing
must have seemed very negative.

267
00:23:24,686 --> 00:23:26,586
I'm sure you've got feelings about that.

268
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:29,388
I'd be happy referring you to another doctor.

269
00:23:29,757 --> 00:23:33,386
This is Dr. Milena Gardosh.
She has a clinic here in London.

270
00:23:33,595 --> 00:23:35,392
You want to know the truth?

271
00:23:35,597 --> 00:23:40,296
The reason I agreed to the evaluation
was because I thought it would be fun.

272
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:41,833
I never...

273
00:23:43,806 --> 00:23:46,366
I never talked to anyone who...

274
00:24:02,158 --> 00:24:03,750
My patient's here.

275
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,594
What do I owe you?

276
00:24:11,802 --> 00:24:13,827
You don't owe me anything.

277
00:24:14,038 --> 00:24:18,941
But if you'd like to call Dr. Gardosh,
I'm sure she can help you.

278
00:24:19,143 --> 00:24:21,134
I don't shop around.

279
00:24:21,345 --> 00:24:24,508
Like you said, trust is very hard to come by.

280
00:24:26,183 --> 00:24:29,482
I was hoping I might find it with you.

281
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:36,959
Listen, why don't we schedule another meeting.

282
00:24:37,162 --> 00:24:40,723
And then we can talk about this
when we're not so rushed.

283
00:25:26,281 --> 00:25:29,717
You look different today. More relaxed.

284
00:25:30,118 --> 00:25:34,384
The more nervous I am,
the more relaxed people think I am.

285
00:25:35,458 --> 00:25:39,087
I wanted to talk about something you
brought up last Wednesday.

286
00:25:39,295 --> 00:25:40,887
You said before the accident...

287
00:25:41,097 --> 00:25:45,033
...you had fantasies of sexual
excitement and driving off the road.

288
00:25:45,401 --> 00:25:47,892
Do you often have fantasies like that?

289
00:25:48,104 --> 00:25:49,969
I have fantasies all the time.

290
00:25:51,073 --> 00:25:54,873
Fantasies involving violence, death?

291
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,038
People die in my novels.

292
00:25:58,248 --> 00:26:01,217
I have to think of new and interesting
ways to kill them.

293
00:26:03,253 --> 00:26:05,778
What happens when you don't take risks?

294
00:26:13,431 --> 00:26:17,299
I'm sorry, there's no smoking in here.
It's a rule.

295
00:26:17,502 --> 00:26:18,969
I don't like rules.

296
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:21,536
I have some of them, and that's one of them.

297
00:26:26,344 --> 00:26:28,574
After the hearing...

298
00:26:28,781 --> 00:26:32,808
...I was interviewed by a reporter
from Urbane magazine.

299
00:26:36,288 --> 00:26:39,917
Adam Towers. He said he knew you.

300
00:26:40,125 --> 00:26:41,922
Slightly. Why?

301
00:26:43,897 --> 00:26:46,957
He told me about the Cheslav case.

302
00:26:47,167 --> 00:26:50,034
I was impressed by what you did.

303
00:26:50,236 --> 00:26:53,535
You knew Cheslav was dangerous.

304
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:55,970
Still you protected him.

305
00:26:57,177 --> 00:26:59,645
You honored his confidentiality...

306
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:02,843
...even at risk to yourself.

307
00:27:04,351 --> 00:27:07,184
Do you think you made the right decision?

308
00:27:07,388 --> 00:27:09,481
Or do you think you fucked up?

309
00:27:11,559 --> 00:27:15,359
Given what I knew at the time,
I made the right decision.

310
00:27:17,766 --> 00:27:21,862
So you still believe in confidentiality.

311
00:27:22,304 --> 00:27:25,740
Within legal limits.
What exactly are you concerned with?

312
00:27:32,581 --> 00:27:36,779
If I told you that I killed Kevin Franks...

313
00:27:36,986 --> 00:27:39,682
...would you report me to the police?

314
00:27:42,558 --> 00:27:43,923
No.

315
00:27:44,126 --> 00:27:48,426
Anything that happened in the past,
I wouldn't discuss outside this room.

316
00:27:51,133 --> 00:27:54,864
But if you told me you were going to
murder someone specifically...

317
00:27:55,072 --> 00:27:57,336
...and I thought you were serious...

318
00:27:57,541 --> 00:27:59,975
...then, yes, I'd go to the police.

319
00:28:01,144 --> 00:28:05,342
I might be manipulating you
to create risk for myself.

320
00:28:08,987 --> 00:28:11,751
Do you want to talk about
what happened to Kevin?

321
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,721
No, not really.

322
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:20,796
I was just checking your policy.

323
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:24,826
So have you decided?

324
00:28:26,405 --> 00:28:29,033
About taking me on as a patient.

325
00:28:33,979 --> 00:28:36,709
Shooter had an ex-wife,
a drinking problem...

326
00:28:36,916 --> 00:28:40,875
...a drug problem, a complicated sex
problem he was barely aware of.

327
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:43,987
And a tremendous amount of
free-floating rage.

328
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:48,183
In short, he was a cop and a very good one.

329
00:28:48,395 --> 00:28:49,487
On March 3rd...

330
00:28:49,696 --> 00:28:52,221
The woman knelt naked at the foot of the bed.

331
00:28:52,432 --> 00:28:54,662
Her back to him, her head on a pillow.

332
00:28:54,868 --> 00:28:59,202
Shooter raked his fingers through her
blond hair and twisted it tight.

333
00:28:59,407 --> 00:29:01,500
She groaned, her breath catching...

334
00:29:01,709 --> 00:29:05,907
...as he suddenly yanked her hair like
a rider pulling on a horse's mane.

335
00:29:06,113 --> 00:29:10,777
The veins on his arms bulged as
he roughly drew her onto him.

336
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,548
Do you remember that cop Washburn?

337
00:29:15,923 --> 00:29:21,156
T o him, the fact that I wasn't upset
about Kevin Franks...

338
00:29:21,363 --> 00:29:24,093
...was proof that I must've killed him.

339
00:29:25,867 --> 00:29:28,961
Then, when I wouldn't break down...

340
00:29:29,171 --> 00:29:31,230
...he hit on me.

341
00:29:33,141 --> 00:29:34,438
Hit on you?

342
00:29:34,644 --> 00:29:35,702
Yeah.

343
00:29:35,912 --> 00:29:39,313
He said that if I fucked him things
would go easier.

344
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:43,451
Homicide cops are usually smarter than that.

345
00:29:44,988 --> 00:29:48,856
I knew one once, in San Francisco.

346
00:29:50,527 --> 00:29:52,461
Nick Curran.

347
00:29:52,663 --> 00:29:54,688
They called him Shooter.

348
00:29:54,898 --> 00:29:58,197
We used to get in his car and ride around...

349
00:29:58,402 --> 00:30:01,599
...Listening to 911 calls on his
scanner...

350
00:30:01,805 --> 00:30:03,568
...then speed over.

351
00:30:03,774 --> 00:30:07,335
Have you ever been to a murder scene
right after it happened?

352
00:30:11,383 --> 00:30:13,749
The body's still warm.

353
00:30:15,086 --> 00:30:17,554
The watch is still ticking.

354
00:30:18,723 --> 00:30:20,748
You can smell the blood.

355
00:30:22,627 --> 00:30:25,425
We'd hang around for a while and then...

356
00:30:25,631 --> 00:30:28,122
...go have sex in Nick's car.

357
00:30:33,305 --> 00:30:35,239
Nick used to say:

358
00:30:35,441 --> 00:30:40,902
"Death is always there.
It's the only thing that's real."

359
00:30:41,113 --> 00:30:44,276
Except maybe sex sometimes.

360
00:30:44,484 --> 00:30:47,078
But only sometimes?

361
00:30:47,287 --> 00:30:49,084
Well...

362
00:30:49,423 --> 00:30:52,620
...I fucked this guy last night.

363
00:30:52,826 --> 00:30:54,987
I fucked him for hours.

364
00:30:55,195 --> 00:30:57,925
You know, we did everything to each other.

365
00:30:59,267 --> 00:31:04,534
The full screaming Masters
and Johnson's greatest hits.

366
00:31:05,006 --> 00:31:10,501
But you know, a week from now,
I probably won't even remember him.

367
00:31:10,712 --> 00:31:14,546
But, if I was with him when he died...

368
00:31:17,152 --> 00:31:18,380
Now...

369
00:31:19,722 --> 00:31:24,682
...I probably would never forget that.

370
00:31:26,729 --> 00:31:27,923
Would I?

371
00:31:29,631 --> 00:31:32,259
Were you ever with anyone when they died?

372
00:31:36,606 --> 00:31:37,698
No.

373
00:31:39,609 --> 00:31:41,076
Christ.

374
00:31:46,249 --> 00:31:48,183
We still have 20 minutes left.

375
00:31:48,384 --> 00:31:50,511
I feel like a cigarette.

376
00:31:50,721 --> 00:31:52,416
See you tomorrow.

377
00:31:53,524 --> 00:31:54,821
She just walked out?

378
00:31:56,994 --> 00:31:58,086
How Lacanian.

379
00:31:58,295 --> 00:32:00,092
For her, time's a weapon.

380
00:32:00,297 --> 00:32:03,289
Everything's a weapon.
Everybody's an enemy.

381
00:32:04,401 --> 00:32:08,462
Do you think she made it up about
the policeman? Washburn?

382
00:32:08,673 --> 00:32:12,234
I don't know. It's so hard to believe
anything she says.

383
00:32:12,444 --> 00:32:14,207
She's trying to seduce you.

384
00:32:14,412 --> 00:32:16,437
They always try to seduce you.

385
00:32:16,648 --> 00:32:19,310
Yes, but this one's different, isn't it?

386
00:32:20,685 --> 00:32:23,483
I don't know. More fun maybe.

387
00:32:23,689 --> 00:32:25,680
Be careful, Michael.

388
00:32:28,528 --> 00:32:32,055
By the way, I got a call from that
reporter, Adam Towers.

389
00:32:33,432 --> 00:32:34,558
What did he want?

390
00:32:34,767 --> 00:32:38,430
I made everything sound boring.
I assured him he didn't have a story.

391
00:32:38,638 --> 00:32:41,334
What if he calls others?
What if he calls Gerst?

392
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:45,638
Gerst won't talk to a popular magazine
reporter. Are you kidding?

393
00:33:00,795 --> 00:33:02,786
Anyway, it was a successful paper.

394
00:33:02,997 --> 00:33:05,693
Published, on this occasion,
under sole authorship.

395
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,561
Well, thank God for that.

396
00:33:07,769 --> 00:33:09,896
Speaking of God, is Gerst coming?

397
00:33:10,104 --> 00:33:12,072
We can only hope and pray.

398
00:33:12,273 --> 00:33:14,434
That he comes or he doesn't?

399
00:33:15,878 --> 00:33:20,440
I'm going for a smoke. Don't talk about
anything interesting till I get back.

400
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:23,509
How long have you lived here?

401
00:33:23,719 --> 00:33:27,314
About six years, something like that.
Seven.

402
00:33:37,601 --> 00:33:38,590
Hi, Dominic.

403
00:33:38,802 --> 00:33:39,962
Hi, Milena.

404
00:33:48,211 --> 00:33:49,178
Thank you.

405
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:54,411
The beauty about antisocial behavior...

406
00:33:54,619 --> 00:33:58,146
...is that it takes you away from other
people, however briefly.

407
00:34:00,224 --> 00:34:01,953
You're not an analyst.

408
00:34:04,395 --> 00:34:05,760
I'm a writer.

409
00:34:05,964 --> 00:34:08,398
Really? What do you write about?

410
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:12,627
Oh, the lurid, the sexual, the violent.

411
00:34:12,838 --> 00:34:14,533
The basic instincts.

412
00:34:15,607 --> 00:34:17,438
They're the most powerful, aren't they?

413
00:34:29,856 --> 00:34:31,084
Milena.

414
00:34:31,291 --> 00:34:32,588
Oh, Michael.

415
00:34:32,792 --> 00:34:35,226
I'm sorry, I didn't ask your name.

416
00:34:35,428 --> 00:34:38,591
Catherine Tramell. Milena Gardosh.

417
00:34:39,667 --> 00:34:42,192
Oh, you're Dr. Gardosh.

418
00:34:42,403 --> 00:34:45,429
I've heard so many wonderful things about you.

419
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:46,970
Catherine.

420
00:34:48,175 --> 00:34:49,540
There you are.

421
00:34:52,379 --> 00:34:56,042
Milena, Dr. Glass.
I see you've met Catherine.

422
00:34:56,251 --> 00:35:00,711
She's doing research for a novel about
an eminent psychoanalyst.

423
00:35:00,922 --> 00:35:03,891
I thought she might enjoy an occasion like this.

424
00:35:06,594 --> 00:35:08,459
Well, may I take your coats?

425
00:35:09,931 --> 00:35:11,694
Thank you.

426
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,197
Excuse me.

427
00:35:15,638 --> 00:35:18,038
Would you put that in my pocket?

428
00:35:19,809 --> 00:35:20,776
Certainly.

429
00:35:22,678 --> 00:35:25,078
Catherine, come this way.

430
00:35:26,482 --> 00:35:30,475
What's going on? What was Gerst
thinking of, bringing her here?

431
00:35:30,687 --> 00:35:33,087
I'm sure he's no idea who she is.

432
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:35,019
Where did he meet her?

433
00:35:35,225 --> 00:35:37,489
She would have met him, believe me.

434
00:35:38,528 --> 00:35:42,157
I can't stay here while I've got
a patient here. I have to go.

435
00:35:42,366 --> 00:35:43,594
I understand.

436
00:35:46,169 --> 00:35:49,070
If you follow inter-subjectivity to its
natural end...

437
00:35:49,273 --> 00:35:52,436
...aren't you asking who's the patient
and who's the doctor?

438
00:35:52,643 --> 00:35:54,508
Those were my very words.

439
00:35:54,712 --> 00:35:56,009
Very good.

440
00:35:57,148 --> 00:35:59,639
Note that one for future reference.

441
00:36:09,061 --> 00:36:11,256
Are you leaving because of me?

442
00:36:14,733 --> 00:36:16,633
You must have known I'd be here.

443
00:36:16,835 --> 00:36:18,666
Is that a problem?

444
00:36:18,871 --> 00:36:22,068
I know some people who play tennis
with their shrinks.

445
00:36:22,275 --> 00:36:23,674
I'm sure you do.

446
00:36:23,877 --> 00:36:27,938
Have sex with them. Sell them drugs.
Work on their screenplays.

447
00:36:28,148 --> 00:36:29,706
But I don't do that.

448
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:34,681
I was upset about our session today.

449
00:36:34,888 --> 00:36:37,857
I felt I owed you an apology.

450
00:36:38,225 --> 00:36:40,250
That's why I came.

451
00:36:41,862 --> 00:36:43,989
We can go into that tomorrow.

452
00:36:44,498 --> 00:36:46,466
I've got a better idea.

453
00:36:46,667 --> 00:36:50,728
How about I ditch everybody
and we go somewhere for a drink.

454
00:36:51,172 --> 00:36:54,801
I told you, I don't socialize with my patients.

455
00:36:55,243 --> 00:36:57,575
Another one of your rules?

456
00:36:57,779 --> 00:37:00,145
Don't you get kind of tired of them?

457
00:37:00,348 --> 00:37:03,715
You know, that's the nightmare
of Shrinkdom, doctor.

458
00:37:03,919 --> 00:37:06,547
Too many answers, too many questions...

459
00:37:06,755 --> 00:37:08,245
...nobody gets laid.

460
00:37:13,663 --> 00:37:16,461
Okay, forget getting laid.

461
00:37:18,668 --> 00:37:20,135
We'll just talk.

462
00:37:21,504 --> 00:37:23,472
We'll talk tomorrow.

463
00:37:42,359 --> 00:37:44,953
Michael. There you are.

464
00:37:45,162 --> 00:37:49,565
Oh, my God. Did you see that woman
that Gerst brought with him?

465
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:51,029
No.

466
00:37:51,236 --> 00:37:53,898
Actually, I was just looking for you.

467
00:37:55,173 --> 00:37:56,333
What, in there?

468
00:37:56,541 --> 00:37:59,533
I was looking for your coat.
I thought we could go for a drink.

469
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:00,711
If that's all right?

470
00:38:03,816 --> 00:38:05,613
Yeah. Great.

471
00:38:46,994 --> 00:38:48,655
What's wrong?

472
00:38:48,863 --> 00:38:50,057
Turn around.

473
00:38:50,264 --> 00:38:51,231
What?

474
00:38:51,432 --> 00:38:52,729
Turn around.

475
00:39:16,945 --> 00:39:18,139
Oh, God!

476
00:39:19,347 --> 00:39:23,443
Michael, it's Denise!
Please pick up the phone! Please!

477
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:26,086
Michael, please pick up the phone!

478
00:39:26,288 --> 00:39:27,721
Denise?

479
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:30,420
Hey, hey, hey. What's happened?

480
00:39:45,542 --> 00:39:47,339
Thanks, guv.

481
00:39:51,615 --> 00:39:53,606
Come in, Michael.

482
00:39:53,817 --> 00:39:55,409
Hey, you okay?

483
00:39:58,021 --> 00:39:59,818
Hey, what's going on?

484
00:40:00,023 --> 00:40:02,491
It's okay, I'm here now. Okay?

485
00:40:02,694 --> 00:40:04,127
Who lives here?

486
00:40:04,329 --> 00:40:06,126
It's Adam's place.

487
00:40:43,136 --> 00:40:44,330
Jesus.

488
00:40:44,904 --> 00:40:46,599
What happened?

489
00:40:46,806 --> 00:40:51,470
I don't know. The door was unlocked
and I just came in.

490
00:40:51,678 --> 00:40:53,646
I just saw him lying there.

491
00:40:56,117 --> 00:40:58,051
Have you called the police?

492
00:40:58,252 --> 00:41:00,152
No. I was afraid.

493
00:41:48,872 --> 00:41:50,669
Hello, Michael.

494
00:41:50,874 --> 00:41:52,739
What are you doing here?

495
00:41:52,943 --> 00:41:55,207
It's my wife. Well, my ex-wife.

496
00:41:55,412 --> 00:41:58,142
She found him like that, then she called me.

497
00:42:04,556 --> 00:42:05,784
I see.

498
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:10,017
And how did she happen to find him like that?

499
00:42:11,062 --> 00:42:13,792
They'd been seeing each other and...

500
00:42:16,167 --> 00:42:17,634
Oh, really?

501
00:42:17,837 --> 00:42:19,395
Since when?

502
00:42:20,806 --> 00:42:22,569
It's why I moved out.

503
00:42:24,076 --> 00:42:27,773
So I assume you weren't the best of friends?

504
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:29,038
No.

505
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:34,510
Yet I saw you talking to him
after the Tramell hearing.

506
00:42:34,721 --> 00:42:36,382
It was just journalist stuff.

507
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:39,423
He was asking me questions about Tramell.

508
00:42:39,626 --> 00:42:41,491
Do you think she killed him?

509
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:44,188
Who?

510
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,163
Denise? No.

511
00:42:49,369 --> 00:42:51,496
No, not a chance.

512
00:42:51,706 --> 00:42:55,164
I've known her for a long time.
She could never do anything like that.

513
00:42:57,311 --> 00:43:01,372
Listen, Roy, I've told my story twice
over. Is it all right if I go home?

514
00:43:03,084 --> 00:43:04,176
All right.

515
00:43:06,754 --> 00:43:08,244
Oh, by the way...

516
00:43:11,093 --> 00:43:12,253
...this yours?

517
00:43:15,831 --> 00:43:18,800
No, I just found it on the floor.

518
00:43:20,269 --> 00:43:22,601
How did it end up in the rubbish?

519
00:43:22,971 --> 00:43:27,271
I stepped on it. It was leaking.
I just threw it away.

520
00:43:30,747 --> 00:43:32,214
Can I go?

521
00:43:35,852 --> 00:43:37,615
Yes, by all means.

522
00:44:41,755 --> 00:44:44,417
I assume you know Adam Towers was killed.

523
00:44:45,859 --> 00:44:47,520
Why would I know?

524
00:44:47,928 --> 00:44:50,453
Because of Denise.

525
00:44:50,665 --> 00:44:51,962
Denise?

526
00:44:52,166 --> 00:44:53,656
Your wife. Your ex-wife.

527
00:44:53,868 --> 00:44:56,268
I know who she is.
How do you know her?

528
00:44:56,804 --> 00:45:00,001
Adam introduced us a couple of times.

529
00:45:00,208 --> 00:45:04,235
It was all very open. I knew about her,
she knew about me.

530
00:45:04,445 --> 00:45:05,912
Knew what about you?

531
00:45:09,051 --> 00:45:11,246
That I was seeing him too.

532
00:45:12,421 --> 00:45:14,981
The Masters and Johnson guy.
That was him.

533
00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:18,284
So... You were sleeping
with Adam Towers?

534
00:45:18,827 --> 00:45:20,658
Occasionally.

535
00:45:23,999 --> 00:45:26,433
So, of course, Washburn thinks I killed him.

536
00:45:26,636 --> 00:45:28,194
Why would he think that?

537
00:45:29,572 --> 00:45:34,566
I kill because I'm addicted to risk.
Or to prove that I exist.

538
00:45:34,778 --> 00:45:36,245
I'm not sure which one it is.

539
00:45:36,446 --> 00:45:38,414
I never said you killed anybody.

540
00:45:38,615 --> 00:45:39,877
But you think I did.

541
00:45:40,083 --> 00:45:44,884
You think I killed Kevin, and now
you're wondering if I killed Adam.

542
00:45:45,089 --> 00:45:48,786
Why don't you just ask me?
Or is that too direct for you?

543
00:45:51,295 --> 00:45:52,785
Did you kill him?

544
00:45:53,764 --> 00:45:57,063
If I said I didn't, would you believe me?

545
00:46:00,706 --> 00:46:01,695
Depends.

546
00:46:02,174 --> 00:46:05,940
On what?
The quality of my performance?

547
00:46:06,144 --> 00:46:09,944
You know what?
I'm glad Adam Towers is dead.

548
00:46:10,148 --> 00:46:11,809
And you should be glad too.

549
00:46:12,017 --> 00:46:14,815
If you're too uptight, I'll be glad for you.

550
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:17,147
Whoever killed him did you a favor.

551
00:46:17,357 --> 00:46:18,517
Favor?

552
00:46:18,791 --> 00:46:23,057
If he'd written that article on Cheslav,
it would've ruined your career.

553
00:46:23,496 --> 00:46:26,522
You haven't told me if you killed him.
Can you put that out?

554
00:46:29,635 --> 00:46:32,570
Put it out now or you can leave, okay?!

555
00:46:39,847 --> 00:46:41,178
Is that better?

556
00:47:20,256 --> 00:47:24,090
When you think about fucking me...

557
00:47:24,294 --> 00:47:26,694
...and I know you do...

558
00:47:26,897 --> 00:47:30,560
...how do you picture it, doctor?

559
00:47:33,170 --> 00:47:37,334
Oh, I know you can't answer me,
so just think it.

560
00:47:38,475 --> 00:47:40,306
Do you want it straight up?

561
00:47:40,511 --> 00:47:41,978
You on top?

562
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:43,613
Me on top?

563
00:47:45,383 --> 00:47:48,147
Do you want it from behind...

564
00:47:51,022 --> 00:47:54,890
...on your knees,
my face in the pillow?

565
00:47:56,194 --> 00:47:58,992
Do you want to beat me up...

566
00:47:59,531 --> 00:48:01,726
...just a little?

567
00:48:01,934 --> 00:48:03,902
Not too hard.

568
00:48:05,671 --> 00:48:08,572
Oh, a little harder than that.

569
00:48:11,743 --> 00:48:14,405
Do you want to come in my mouth?

570
00:48:17,217 --> 00:48:22,450
What if I told you that I masturbate
thinking about you?

571
00:48:23,823 --> 00:48:25,950
That I make myself come...

572
00:48:26,159 --> 00:48:30,289
...thinking about you
making yourself come.

573
00:48:40,841 --> 00:48:43,241
I guess we're out of time for today.

574
00:48:53,922 --> 00:48:55,856
I'm terminating therapy.

575
00:48:56,057 --> 00:48:57,615
Send me the bill.

576
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:09,405
Miss Tramell, it's Dr. Glass here.

577
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:13,340
Listen, I'm concerned about how our
session ended today.

578
00:49:13,546 --> 00:49:16,242
I'd like to talk through
any misunderstandings...

579
00:49:16,449 --> 00:49:18,474
...there might be between us.

580
00:49:18,684 --> 00:49:21,778
As soon as you get this message,
please give me a...

581
00:49:23,122 --> 00:49:25,317
Just call me when you can.

582
00:49:25,526 --> 00:49:27,357
Evening, Dr. Glass.

583
00:49:28,395 --> 00:49:29,987
Could I have a word?

584
00:49:30,197 --> 00:49:32,165
Sure. Upstairs.

585
00:49:37,037 --> 00:49:38,732
Is that German?

586
00:49:38,939 --> 00:49:40,406
Can I get you anything?

587
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:41,801
No.

588
00:49:42,010 --> 00:49:43,944
So here's a surprise.

589
00:49:44,145 --> 00:49:48,514
Adam Towers had a girlfriend besides Denise.

590
00:49:48,716 --> 00:49:50,013
Guess who.

591
00:49:51,453 --> 00:49:53,182
Catherine Tramell.

592
00:49:54,622 --> 00:49:55,953
You don't look surprised.

593
00:49:56,157 --> 00:49:58,091
She's a private patient of mine.

594
00:49:58,294 --> 00:49:59,761
I see. Since when?

595
00:49:59,962 --> 00:50:01,020
Not long.

596
00:50:02,264 --> 00:50:06,963
So your ex and your private patient
were both screwing Adam Towers.

597
00:50:07,169 --> 00:50:10,297
That's quite a coincidence.
Did they know each other?

598
00:50:10,506 --> 00:50:13,031
I don't know. I don't think so.
Did you...?

599
00:50:15,612 --> 00:50:20,811
Tramell's prints were all over Towers'
apartment, along with others.

600
00:50:21,017 --> 00:50:25,181
But what's interesting is the last call
he made was to her mobile phone...

601
00:50:25,388 --> 00:50:27,481
...90 minutes before he died.

602
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:29,989
Her story is she was out walking all that time.

603
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:33,993
Two hours strolling around Clerkenwell
and nobody saw her, so...

604
00:50:34,198 --> 00:50:37,167
Come on, Michael. Talk to me.

605
00:50:38,236 --> 00:50:42,104
I can't tell you anything. Even if I
knew something, which I don't.

606
00:50:43,641 --> 00:50:47,668
Franks was first. Towers second.
There's bound to be a third.

607
00:50:47,879 --> 00:50:49,642
This goes beyond confidentiality.

608
00:50:49,848 --> 00:50:53,409
You've got a legal obligation to protect
a potential victim.

609
00:50:53,619 --> 00:50:57,612
You can't lock somebody up because
you think they might do something.

610
00:50:57,823 --> 00:51:01,224
Why don't you tell me what you know
about this article...

611
00:51:01,426 --> 00:51:04,884
...Towers was writing about you
and our old friend George Cheslav.

612
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:09,530
Who told you he was writing an article?

613
00:51:09,836 --> 00:51:11,030
His editor.

614
00:51:11,237 --> 00:51:14,297
He'd been very busy.
He had a lot of information on you.

615
00:51:16,109 --> 00:51:17,804
What, and you think I killed him...

616
00:51:18,011 --> 00:51:20,275
...to stop him writing
some stupid article?

617
00:51:20,947 --> 00:51:26,351
No. But just for the record, why don't
you tell me how you spent last night.

618
00:51:26,554 --> 00:51:29,455
Between, say,
7 p.m. and 2 in the morning.

619
00:51:29,657 --> 00:51:32,148
You know, broad strokes.

620
00:51:34,695 --> 00:51:37,061
I had patients until 8 p.m.

621
00:51:37,264 --> 00:51:39,357
Then went to a party in Collingham Gardens.

622
00:51:39,567 --> 00:51:41,296
I left there about 11 with a woman.

623
00:51:41,503 --> 00:51:45,269
We came here and I was on my knees
fucking her when Denise called.

624
00:51:49,611 --> 00:51:51,340
On your knees, eh?

625
00:51:52,547 --> 00:51:55,607
Sounds like your evening was better than mine.

626
00:51:55,817 --> 00:51:59,913
Could I get her name?
So there are no loose ends.

627
00:52:02,191 --> 00:52:05,922
Look, Michael, Adam Towers
was fucking your ex-wife...

628
00:52:06,128 --> 00:52:10,462
...and about to do the same
to your career. I've got to ask.

629
00:52:15,305 --> 00:52:16,863
Michelle Broadwin.

630
00:52:18,442 --> 00:52:22,902
She's a psycho-pharmacologist at
Victoria Psychiatric Hospital.

631
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:27,342
Thank you.

632
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:31,210
I'll be in touch.

633
00:52:36,394 --> 00:52:37,554
What does that mean?

634
00:52:41,399 --> 00:52:42,991
I smell blood.

635
00:52:58,050 --> 00:53:03,078
Yeah, not all of them, of course, but,
you know, some of them.

636
00:53:03,289 --> 00:53:07,157
They're all so sanctimonious...

637
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:09,487
...so judgmental.

638
00:53:09,696 --> 00:53:15,191
All my friends, they drink too much.
They snort too much coke.

639
00:53:15,402 --> 00:53:17,836
Miss Tramell,
it's Dr. Glass here again.

640
00:53:18,038 --> 00:53:20,802
I'm a little concerned I haven't heard from you.

641
00:53:21,007 --> 00:53:23,339
I was wondering whether you're okay.

642
00:53:23,544 --> 00:53:27,571
Look, let me give you
my home number. It's 0207...

643
00:53:27,782 --> 00:53:32,014
Sorry, it really got to me and I don't
know why it seems to be doing that.

644
00:53:32,219 --> 00:53:36,417
Why it's getting worse.
I mean, I was really excited.

645
00:53:36,624 --> 00:53:39,593
You have no new messages.

646
00:54:06,889 --> 00:54:08,789
The thing about Gerst is this:

647
00:54:08,991 --> 00:54:11,789
The selection committee is just a formality.

648
00:54:11,994 --> 00:54:13,928
This is the real interview.

649
00:54:15,666 --> 00:54:17,429
Relax.

650
00:54:17,634 --> 00:54:20,603
Be direct, candid.

651
00:54:20,804 --> 00:54:23,238
But not too candid.

652
00:54:25,376 --> 00:54:29,244
Very good time. They always get lost
on the way. Come in.

653
00:54:29,446 --> 00:54:31,277
Meet my new Mughal painting.

654
00:54:31,483 --> 00:54:33,246
Not another one.

655
00:54:33,451 --> 00:54:37,649
An Indian goddess at peace. It has a
tranquility to it, don't you think?

656
00:54:38,289 --> 00:54:42,191
I wonder what the males are doing,
loitering so close to her?

657
00:54:42,394 --> 00:54:45,886
It's obvious. They're worshiping her.

658
00:54:46,097 --> 00:54:47,291
As they should.

659
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:51,227
Perhaps that's why she has eight arms
to fend them off.

660
00:54:51,437 --> 00:54:55,771
Why don't you girls go outside
while Dr. Glass and I have our chat.

661
00:54:57,209 --> 00:54:59,439
Come. Come.

662
00:55:00,045 --> 00:55:03,014
Come with me. You'll enjoy it.

663
00:55:07,421 --> 00:55:10,447
So, Dr. Glass, I have a question:

664
00:55:10,857 --> 00:55:12,620
Do you think I'm insane?

665
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:15,361
Pardon?

666
00:55:15,929 --> 00:55:18,090
Nuts? Bonkers? Off my trolley?

667
00:55:18,899 --> 00:55:20,594
No, not at all.

668
00:55:21,169 --> 00:55:24,434
But I might be if I recommended you
for the Douglas Chair.

669
00:55:26,874 --> 00:55:28,171
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

670
00:55:28,843 --> 00:55:30,777
George Cheslav.

671
00:55:31,412 --> 00:55:36,509
A major drug dealer, under your care,
brutally murders his girlfriend.

672
00:55:36,717 --> 00:55:38,878
An inquiry is held...

673
00:55:39,087 --> 00:55:42,818
...where Detective Roy Washburn...

674
00:55:43,025 --> 00:55:46,358
...testifies that you acted
professionally at all times.

675
00:55:46,562 --> 00:55:47,551
You're blameless.

676
00:55:47,763 --> 00:55:48,855
That's right, I was.

677
00:55:49,832 --> 00:55:53,563
However, after the trial...

678
00:55:53,769 --> 00:55:57,535
...you experienced what we might term
an emotional meltdown:

679
00:55:57,774 --> 00:55:59,036
Depression...

680
00:55:59,242 --> 00:56:01,403
...occupational underachievement...

681
00:56:01,611 --> 00:56:03,272
...marital problems...

682
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:06,916
...and questionable professional
conduct...

683
00:56:07,116 --> 00:56:11,018
...much discussed at dinner parties
around our great city.

684
00:56:13,424 --> 00:56:14,482
I'm sorry?

685
00:56:15,793 --> 00:56:18,557
Now you want my support for the Douglas Chair.

686
00:56:23,634 --> 00:56:25,864
No more Cheslavs, Michael.

687
00:56:28,839 --> 00:56:29,999
No.

688
00:56:36,248 --> 00:56:38,011
No more Cheslavs.

689
00:58:18,122 --> 00:58:19,146
Catherine!

690
00:58:33,171 --> 00:58:36,538
Sorry. All right.
Sorry, I'm just looking for someone.

691
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:19,905
Not love. It's...

692
01:00:22,144 --> 01:00:23,577
I don't know.

693
01:00:28,183 --> 01:00:31,346
You have to terminate this therapy, right away.

694
01:00:32,621 --> 01:00:35,784
Well, it's already done.
She terminated it herself.

695
01:00:35,991 --> 01:00:36,958
Good.

696
01:00:37,993 --> 01:00:41,087
If she calls again, give her my number.

697
01:00:45,267 --> 01:00:47,258
I'm a woman.

698
01:00:47,469 --> 01:00:50,302
She'll relate to me differently.

699
01:01:33,515 --> 01:01:35,483
What are you doing here?

700
01:01:35,684 --> 01:01:37,879
Where she goes, I go.

701
01:01:38,086 --> 01:01:39,246
Since when?

702
01:01:39,454 --> 01:01:43,083
Since she started coming
to your office five days a week.

703
01:01:45,827 --> 01:01:50,662
So, Adam Towers.
Seems his research has gone missing.

704
01:01:50,866 --> 01:01:53,858
All his notebooks, audiotapes,
even his hard drive.

705
01:01:54,069 --> 01:01:56,799
Everything on George Cheslav and Michael Glass.

706
01:01:57,005 --> 01:01:59,599
- You think Catherine has it?
- I know she does.

707
01:01:59,808 --> 01:02:03,209
She ever tell you about them
when she's chatting on the couch?

708
01:02:03,411 --> 01:02:04,639
You know I can't discuss that.

709
01:02:04,846 --> 01:02:08,111
Come on. I've been very good to you
these past few years.

710
01:02:08,316 --> 01:02:11,114
I'm practically a psychopath delivery service.

711
01:02:11,319 --> 01:02:12,877
I can't break privilege.

712
01:02:13,088 --> 01:02:16,421
Pity. I have something
you might like to know about.

713
01:02:16,625 --> 01:02:20,061
Someone says you'd been lying
at the Cheslav inquest.

714
01:02:20,262 --> 01:02:21,729
Who?

715
01:02:21,930 --> 01:02:24,524
You want me to break privilege?

716
01:02:25,967 --> 01:02:29,425
Since you're a friend,
it was your ex-wife.

717
01:02:29,638 --> 01:02:31,162
Denise?

718
01:02:31,373 --> 01:02:33,170
You want to sort her out.

719
01:02:33,375 --> 01:02:37,334
Who knows, she might tell you
where Towers' notes went.

720
01:02:59,668 --> 01:03:04,002
Someone's here.
Do you want us to say?

721
01:03:04,206 --> 01:03:06,606
I'll be all right. Don't worry.

722
01:03:06,808 --> 01:03:08,366
We'll see you later.

723
01:03:11,713 --> 01:03:12,839
How you doing?

724
01:03:14,549 --> 01:03:15,709
Okay.

725
01:03:17,419 --> 01:03:18,716
Do you want a drink?

726
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:21,184
No, I have to go.

727
01:03:21,389 --> 01:03:24,085
I'm meeting someone at the Atlantic Bar.

728
01:03:25,193 --> 01:03:30,062
Denise, did you tell Towers that
I lied at the Cheslav inquiry?

729
01:03:31,499 --> 01:03:34,593
Of course, there's always an agenda.

730
01:03:34,803 --> 01:03:38,739
No. I said you knew he was going
to kill his girlfriend.

731
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:40,202
I didn't. That's a lie.

732
01:03:40,408 --> 01:03:41,636
Yes, you did.

733
01:03:41,843 --> 01:03:46,371
You kept saying how you knew
and should have gone to the police.

734
01:03:46,581 --> 01:03:51,177
I didn't know. I sensed. And I told you
that as my wife in confidence.

735
01:03:51,386 --> 01:03:55,379
I didn't think you'd go and repeat it
in bed to some moron reporter.

736
01:03:57,826 --> 01:04:01,455
Do you want to ruin my life, is that it?
You want to ruin my practice?

737
01:04:02,731 --> 01:04:06,132
Your life? Your practice?

738
01:04:06,334 --> 01:04:09,633
Catherine was right,
everything's always about you.

739
01:04:09,838 --> 01:04:12,932
What about me? Adam's dead
and I'm a murder suspect.

740
01:04:13,141 --> 01:04:17,601
Washburn keeps going on about me
not cooperating, like I'm a liar.

741
01:04:17,812 --> 01:04:19,780
I don't know where Adam's notes are.

742
01:04:19,981 --> 01:04:23,348
I'm scared to go home. I'm scared
to go out. I'm going out of my mind.

743
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:24,848
Be careful about Catherine.

744
01:04:25,053 --> 01:04:26,418
Don't tell me what to do!

745
01:04:26,621 --> 01:04:27,588
Just calm down.

746
01:04:27,789 --> 01:04:29,814
Don't tell me to fucking calm down!

747
01:04:30,025 --> 01:04:30,992
Hey, come on.

748
01:04:31,192 --> 01:04:34,320
That's my wife, okay?
This is a private conversation.

749
01:04:34,529 --> 01:04:36,554
Get out of my way! Out of my way!

750
01:06:41,589 --> 01:06:44,114
Denise. Oh, Denise!

751
01:06:44,325 --> 01:06:45,622
Come on.

752
01:06:46,694 --> 01:06:48,719
Come on, come on.

753
01:06:55,737 --> 01:06:58,365
Come on, Denise. Look at me.

754
01:06:59,574 --> 01:07:01,007
Call an ambulance!

755
01:07:01,509 --> 01:07:03,136
Do it now!

756
01:07:04,179 --> 01:07:06,113
Come on. Let's go.

757
01:07:07,515 --> 01:07:10,678
Stay with me. Come on. Stay with me.

758
01:07:11,986 --> 01:07:13,851
Come on. Stay with me.

759
01:07:46,855 --> 01:07:49,119
You have a problem, Michael.

760
01:07:50,925 --> 01:07:54,759
Witnesses say they saw you arguing.
She was crying.

761
01:07:54,963 --> 01:07:57,989
You grabbed her.
She almost fell down.

762
01:07:58,199 --> 01:08:01,760
Five minutes later, somebody slits her throat.

763
01:08:03,605 --> 01:08:07,598
Also, there are people here who think
you killed Towers.

764
01:08:07,809 --> 01:08:11,176
Towers? Didn't you speak to Michelle?

765
01:08:11,379 --> 01:08:15,145
Yes. But now I'm hearing about this
cigarette lighter with your prints on it.

766
01:08:15,350 --> 01:08:16,442
I just picked that up.

767
01:08:16,651 --> 01:08:21,486
And your ex is in a coma just as she's
to say something inconvenient for you.

768
01:08:21,689 --> 01:08:23,657
I was trying to save her life.

769
01:08:28,062 --> 01:08:31,998
Look, I spoke to Towers' assistant
at Urbane magazine.

770
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:36,102
He expected Denise to say that you
perjured yourself at Cheslav's inquiry.

771
01:08:36,304 --> 01:08:37,794
She wasn't going to say that.

772
01:08:38,006 --> 01:08:39,803
What was she going to say?

773
01:08:45,980 --> 01:08:47,208
Sorry, guv.

774
01:08:57,225 --> 01:08:58,817
You wait there.

775
01:09:56,384 --> 01:09:57,612
So...

776
01:09:59,153 --> 01:10:04,318
Your ex and Catherine Tramell
were girl buddies. Did you know that?

777
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:07,685
What do you mean "girl buddies"?

778
01:10:07,895 --> 01:10:12,423
According to Catherine,
they met through Towers and hit it off.

779
01:10:15,970 --> 01:10:19,098
Denise told Catherine that Towers had
been pressuring her...

780
01:10:19,307 --> 01:10:22,105
...into saying that you'd perjured
yourself.

781
01:10:22,310 --> 01:10:26,246
But Denise wasn't having it.
She was going to say you were clean.

782
01:10:27,815 --> 01:10:31,114
You didn't know Cheslav was going to
kill his girlfriend, did you?

783
01:10:31,319 --> 01:10:34,083
In fact, it came
as a complete surprise, didn't it?

784
01:10:39,127 --> 01:10:41,391
- Of course she's lying.
- How do you know?

785
01:10:41,596 --> 01:10:45,760
Everything that comes out of her is a
lie. Even the truth's a lie with her.

786
01:10:45,967 --> 01:10:48,993
It's her way of getting you to think
what she wants you to think.

787
01:10:49,203 --> 01:10:51,398
That's her art. The art of mind-fucking.

788
01:10:51,606 --> 01:10:53,335
She might be a talented writer.

789
01:10:53,541 --> 01:10:56,806
When it comes to mind-fucking,
she's the all-time genius.

790
01:11:00,214 --> 01:11:02,307
She really got to you, didn't she?

791
01:11:05,653 --> 01:11:08,747
What do you mean?
What did she tell you about me?

792
01:11:09,290 --> 01:11:11,850
Well, what is there to tell?

793
01:11:12,060 --> 01:11:15,962
Don't play games with me.
She can pull it off, you can't.

794
01:11:20,335 --> 01:11:21,563
Where are you going?

795
01:11:21,769 --> 01:11:25,728
Someplace else. Unless
you have evidence to charge me.

796
01:11:27,008 --> 01:11:28,236
Do you?

797
01:11:30,211 --> 01:11:31,838
I didn't think so.

798
01:12:10,518 --> 01:12:12,679
He let you go, finally.

799
01:12:12,887 --> 01:12:14,411
I was worried.

800
01:12:15,423 --> 01:12:18,620
You lied to Washburn for me. Why?

801
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:21,690
I knew you hadn't hurt Denise.

802
01:12:21,896 --> 01:12:24,387
How could you know that?

803
01:12:24,599 --> 01:12:27,534
Because I know you.

804
01:12:27,735 --> 01:12:31,398
And I know the cops were keeping you
just to play some kind of game.

805
01:12:31,606 --> 01:12:34,006
What, like getting me to talk about you?

806
01:12:34,208 --> 01:12:39,111
Yeah, but you wouldn't do that,
because you're into confidentiality.

807
01:12:42,350 --> 01:12:44,341
Why were you meeting with Denise?

808
01:12:44,852 --> 01:12:47,480
Research for my novel.

809
01:12:47,889 --> 01:12:49,220
Research.

810
01:12:49,424 --> 01:12:50,550
About what?

811
01:12:50,758 --> 01:12:52,487
About you.

812
01:12:52,693 --> 01:12:55,662
And Cheslav, the masked psychotic.

813
01:12:58,699 --> 01:13:02,226
The analyst in my book is obsessed
with that sort of thing.

814
01:13:04,238 --> 01:13:07,207
Washburn thinks that you slit Denise's throat.

815
01:13:08,843 --> 01:13:12,301
Me? You're the one that hated her.

816
01:13:12,513 --> 01:13:15,539
Maybe I'm acting out your unconscious impulses.

817
01:13:15,817 --> 01:13:17,079
Stop it!

818
01:13:20,154 --> 01:13:24,318
Do you think it's possible that
you want me to be the killer?

819
01:13:24,525 --> 01:13:28,894
You know, how some guys are into blonds...

820
01:13:29,096 --> 01:13:31,462
...and some guys are into killers.

821
01:13:33,100 --> 01:13:34,829
Isn't that what you're into?

822
01:13:38,039 --> 01:13:40,599
Isn't that what turns you on?

823
01:13:42,977 --> 01:13:44,342
Turns me on?

824
01:13:48,983 --> 01:13:51,349
Isn't that why you're over here?

825
01:14:34,695 --> 01:14:35,719
Okay.

826
01:14:36,931 --> 01:14:38,523
I trust you.

827
01:14:39,867 --> 01:14:41,334
You trust me.

828
01:16:03,384 --> 01:16:05,784
Is there somewhere we can talk?

829
01:16:05,986 --> 01:16:07,419
Over there.

830
01:16:22,736 --> 01:16:24,294
Can I guess where you got it?

831
01:16:24,505 --> 01:16:26,336
Let's find out what it is first.

832
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:31,102
It would be highly improper of me to
accept any evidence in this fashion.

833
01:16:31,312 --> 01:16:32,506
Fine.

834
01:16:32,713 --> 01:16:36,080
It'll take me a few days to get it analyzed.

835
01:16:36,283 --> 01:16:39,184
You'd have made a good cop, Michael.

836
01:16:39,386 --> 01:16:41,650
You like the smell of blood.

837
01:16:50,197 --> 01:16:52,222
Dr. Glass.

838
01:16:52,433 --> 01:16:54,230
Hold on.

839
01:16:54,435 --> 01:16:57,165
I was just thinking about you.

840
01:16:57,371 --> 01:17:00,772
I might have more
psychiatric evaluations for you.

841
01:17:00,975 --> 01:17:03,102
That's nice, but I'm busy at the moment.

842
01:17:03,744 --> 01:17:08,272
Oh, that's a pity.
You were so good with Catherine.

843
01:17:08,482 --> 01:17:11,781
She tells me you're very perceptive.

844
01:17:11,986 --> 01:17:14,386
She's very perceptive herself.

845
01:17:17,825 --> 01:17:22,660
I hope Detective Washburn isn't giving
you cause for...

846
01:17:22,863 --> 01:17:24,125
...concern?

847
01:17:25,466 --> 01:17:26,990
What do you mean?

848
01:17:27,201 --> 01:17:29,795
Well, given his past record.

849
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:34,398
What past record?

850
01:18:37,037 --> 01:18:38,561
I want to talk to you.

851
01:18:38,772 --> 01:18:40,569
Oh, so now you want to talk.

852
01:18:40,774 --> 01:18:44,733
Look, this "Dirtiest Cop in London,"
it doesn't mention him by name.

853
01:18:44,945 --> 01:18:48,472
But this "Detective X," is that Roy Washburn?

854
01:18:51,452 --> 01:18:53,079
Is it Washburn?

855
01:18:54,154 --> 01:18:55,485
Excuse me?

856
01:18:59,526 --> 01:19:01,357
Yeah, it's him.

857
01:19:04,832 --> 01:19:05,924
Are you sure?

858
01:19:06,133 --> 01:19:10,229
Adam may have been a sloppy writer,
but he had excellent sources.

859
01:19:10,437 --> 01:19:14,840
What about perjury, intimidation,
falsifying evidence. Is that true?

860
01:19:15,042 --> 01:19:16,669
A policeman fabricating evidence.

861
01:19:16,877 --> 01:19:17,935
But you have proof?

862
01:19:18,145 --> 01:19:21,273
How about Kevin Franks
and the Case of the Killer Orgasm?

863
01:19:21,482 --> 01:19:24,645
When I did Catherine Tramell's
assessment, I read that report.

864
01:19:24,852 --> 01:19:27,548
Those syringes found in the car contained DTC.

865
01:19:27,754 --> 01:19:30,917
Yeah, well, who found the syringes in the car?

866
01:19:31,125 --> 01:19:33,150
But why would Washburn do that?

867
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:35,692
Adam thought he did it to set up
Catherine Tramell.

868
01:19:35,896 --> 01:19:37,659
Why didn't he write about it?

869
01:19:40,667 --> 01:19:42,328
That's the whole point.

870
01:19:43,370 --> 01:19:45,133
He was going to.

871
01:19:46,273 --> 01:19:47,968
Then he got killed.

872
01:20:11,265 --> 01:20:14,860
I owe you an apology.
About Roy Washburn. I...

873
01:20:15,068 --> 01:20:16,501
I don't like apologies.

874
01:20:19,439 --> 01:20:24,399
I also don't like people stealing things
from my apartment.

875
01:20:27,080 --> 01:20:31,540
The insulin? In case you haven't had it
analyzed yet.

876
01:20:32,819 --> 01:20:33,786
Insulin?

877
01:20:33,987 --> 01:20:35,887
My friend's diabetic.

878
01:20:36,089 --> 01:20:38,717
Let yourself out, doctor.

879
01:21:34,248 --> 01:21:35,738
Hello, Michael.

880
01:21:39,253 --> 01:21:40,311
What do you want?

881
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:42,454
I got the lab analysis back.

882
01:21:42,656 --> 01:21:46,183
D-Tubocurarine. Funny that.

883
01:21:47,995 --> 01:21:49,792
You're sure it's not insulin?

884
01:21:50,297 --> 01:21:51,821
Insulin?

885
01:21:52,032 --> 01:21:53,158
No.

886
01:21:53,367 --> 01:21:55,426
Can I see the report?

887
01:21:57,170 --> 01:22:01,766
You've got some trust issues there.
You might want to work on that.

888
01:22:10,984 --> 01:22:14,715
This isn't an official Forensic Services report.

889
01:22:14,921 --> 01:22:19,688
No. Because an unpreserved or
contaminated chain of evidence...

890
01:22:19,893 --> 01:22:25,195
...will be deemed inadmissible
in a future trial, Inspector Clouseau.

891
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:28,991
So do you want to tell me where you found it?

892
01:22:34,808 --> 01:22:36,173
She's not worth it.

893
01:22:36,376 --> 01:22:39,174
People are dying and I will have her for it.

894
01:22:39,379 --> 01:22:41,904
If you stand in my way, I'll have you as well.

895
01:22:42,115 --> 01:22:44,083
I can fucking promise you that.

896
01:22:48,989 --> 01:22:51,787
I've got something to show you.
Get in the car.

897
01:22:55,262 --> 01:22:56,559
Get in!

898
01:23:12,279 --> 01:23:14,645
Medical examiner's on his way.

899
01:23:28,862 --> 01:23:30,295
Hello, guv.

900
01:23:38,538 --> 01:23:41,666
Were you working that night?

901
01:23:41,875 --> 01:23:43,843
No, I don't know.

902
01:23:45,045 --> 01:23:48,708
Did you see or hear
anything suspicious yesterday?

903
01:23:48,915 --> 01:23:50,576
Not yesterday. No.

904
01:23:50,784 --> 01:23:53,150
- Nothing?
- No.

905
01:23:53,353 --> 01:23:54,843
How long have you worked here?

906
01:23:55,055 --> 01:23:56,454
Four months.

907
01:23:56,656 --> 01:23:57,918
Four months?

908
01:23:59,092 --> 01:24:01,026
Where were you before that?

909
01:24:06,166 --> 01:24:07,133
Ted.

910
01:24:07,334 --> 01:24:08,460
Hi, guv.

911
01:24:08,668 --> 01:24:11,535
- -remember I talked to Vice earlier and
they said...

912
01:24:11,738 --> 01:24:13,467
Fergie, give me a minute.

913
01:24:13,673 --> 01:24:14,765
Let's go.

914
01:24:35,529 --> 01:24:37,053
Who is he?

915
01:24:37,264 --> 01:24:41,997
Richard Pepovic.
Known to his friends as Dickie Pep.

916
01:24:45,505 --> 01:24:46,904
You know him?

917
01:24:47,107 --> 01:24:48,540
No.

918
01:24:48,742 --> 01:24:50,334
Look at this.

919
01:24:58,652 --> 01:25:03,521
Now, we'll have to wait for the lab
results, of course...

920
01:25:03,723 --> 01:25:08,160
...but what's the betting he's oozing
Tubocurarine?

921
01:25:10,330 --> 01:25:13,231
Now do you want to tell me
who gave you the sample?

922
01:25:19,339 --> 01:25:21,204
You don't know she did it.

923
01:25:22,409 --> 01:25:23,501
No.

924
01:25:25,545 --> 01:25:29,208
But then again, maybe I killed him.

925
01:25:30,250 --> 01:25:32,218
Isn't that what she's gonna tell you?

926
01:25:32,419 --> 01:25:34,546
He had something on me, so I killed him.

927
01:25:34,754 --> 01:25:37,689
Then I jerked him off even though he was dead...

928
01:25:37,891 --> 01:25:40,223
...to make it look like
there was come everywhere...

929
01:25:40,427 --> 01:25:42,054
...to make it look like it was her.

930
01:25:45,232 --> 01:25:50,260
Look, Towers was right about me,
I put them away whatever it takes.

931
01:25:50,470 --> 01:25:52,836
So, fine, don't trust me.

932
01:25:53,039 --> 01:25:55,030
You know Catherine better than me.

933
01:25:55,242 --> 01:25:57,506
If you have five seconds
when you're not dizzy...

934
01:25:57,711 --> 01:26:01,169
...with the smell of her pussy,
ask yourself: Do you trust her?

935
01:26:02,682 --> 01:26:03,808
Do you?

936
01:26:09,422 --> 01:26:13,324
She's George Cheslav, times three.
We both know it.

937
01:26:13,527 --> 01:26:15,722
The question is:
How do we put her away?

938
01:26:15,929 --> 01:26:20,298
If you tell the courts that she's made a
direct threat against someone...

939
01:26:20,500 --> 01:26:21,626
But she hasn't.

940
01:26:21,835 --> 01:26:24,998
If you say she did, and that got her put
on a psych ward...

941
01:26:25,205 --> 01:26:28,368
...stopped her from killing again,
wouldn't that be worth it?

942
01:26:28,575 --> 01:26:32,238
Some kind of redemption for Cheslav at last?

943
01:26:35,882 --> 01:26:38,874
Look, I'm prejudiced.

944
01:26:39,085 --> 01:26:41,417
Don't take my word for it.

945
01:26:42,722 --> 01:26:44,519
Talk to this guy.

946
01:26:49,095 --> 01:26:50,790
Listen to him.

947
01:27:16,556 --> 01:27:19,150
Lieutenant Walker. It's Michael.

948
01:27:19,359 --> 01:27:21,384
Look, thanks for talking to me.

949
01:27:21,595 --> 01:27:24,894
It's just that I did an evaluation
of Miss Tramell...

950
01:27:33,106 --> 01:27:37,338
Darkness had fallen and even before
the buzzer sounded...

951
01:27:37,544 --> 01:27:40,775
...Kelly knew it would be the doctor.

952
01:27:40,981 --> 01:27:44,109
He'd come to accuse her of more crimes.

953
01:27:44,317 --> 01:27:46,808
They'd fight about that and then have sex...

954
01:27:47,020 --> 01:27:49,511
...and everything would be
all right again.

955
01:27:49,723 --> 01:27:51,315
Except it wouldn't be...

956
01:27:51,524 --> 01:27:53,515
...if he didn't trust her.

957
01:28:29,462 --> 01:28:30,622
Hi, handsome.

958
01:28:31,031 --> 01:28:32,498
My new novel.

959
01:28:32,699 --> 01:28:35,327
I'm anxious to hear what you think about it.

960
01:28:36,670 --> 01:28:39,332
I've been speaking to Lieutenant Phil Walker...

961
01:28:39,539 --> 01:28:42,303
...the San Francisco
Police Department.

962
01:28:42,509 --> 01:28:47,310
Paranoid Phil.
Now there's a blast from the past.

963
01:28:47,514 --> 01:28:52,008
He said you murdered a Johnny Boz
and two detectives in San Francisco.

964
01:28:52,218 --> 01:28:54,482
I was never even charged.

965
01:28:54,688 --> 01:28:58,283
Grand jury said that Nick Curran's
girlfriend did it.

966
01:29:00,694 --> 01:29:04,755
I'm going to take a Jacuzzi.
Care to join me?

967
01:29:10,704 --> 01:29:15,038
All right, all right.
I killed Johnny Boz.

968
01:29:15,241 --> 01:29:16,435
Why?

969
01:29:16,643 --> 01:29:18,838
I didn't like him.

970
01:29:19,045 --> 01:29:20,945
For the money.

971
01:29:21,147 --> 01:29:23,741
To see if I could get away with it.

972
01:29:25,418 --> 01:29:29,218
To show that death really isn't very important.

973
01:29:29,422 --> 01:29:30,855
Because I was bored.

974
01:29:31,057 --> 01:29:33,548
And you know how I hate being bored.

975
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:35,557
What about Denise, huh?

976
01:29:35,762 --> 01:29:36,956
Adam Towers?

977
01:29:37,163 --> 01:29:39,393
Adam was insufferable.

978
01:29:39,599 --> 01:29:41,692
And you are something special.

979
01:29:42,936 --> 01:29:47,635
Adam was trying to ruin you just
out of spite, and I couldn't bear it.

980
01:29:49,476 --> 01:29:51,205
This is wonderful.

981
01:29:57,217 --> 01:29:58,479
Denise.

982
01:29:59,018 --> 01:30:02,715
Denise... Denise was good in bed.

983
01:30:02,922 --> 01:30:06,414
Denise would have spoiled
everything I'd accomplished...

984
01:30:06,626 --> 01:30:08,594
...by killing Adam Towers.

985
01:30:09,763 --> 01:30:12,926
God, you can't tell the truth
about anything, can you?

986
01:30:15,068 --> 01:30:17,662
You don't believe me when I say I did it.

987
01:30:17,871 --> 01:30:20,840
You don't believe me when I say I didn't do it.

988
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:24,066
What is the point of talking to you, anyway?

989
01:30:27,714 --> 01:30:29,443
Oh, come on.

990
01:30:31,885 --> 01:30:34,945
Why don't you take your clothes off
and get in, huh?

991
01:30:47,066 --> 01:30:50,695
This is worse than Cheslav, isn't it?

992
01:30:50,904 --> 01:30:54,601
This time you knew
right from the start what I was.

993
01:30:56,709 --> 01:31:00,042
And you let it happen again, didn't you?

994
01:31:01,548 --> 01:31:05,006
It's almost like you killed them yourself.

995
01:31:13,827 --> 01:31:16,694
Who do you think I'm going to kill next?

996
01:31:22,035 --> 01:31:23,764
Come on.

997
01:31:23,970 --> 01:31:26,700
You can figure it out.

998
01:33:18,351 --> 01:33:22,117
Kelly met the analyst during her little
stay at Holloway Prison.

999
01:33:23,423 --> 01:33:26,756
His eyes were a beautiful shade of blue.

1000
01:33:26,960 --> 01:33:29,428
Did Kelly trust the doctor?

1001
01:33:29,629 --> 01:33:32,826
Did she mean it
when she told him she wanted help?

1002
01:33:33,032 --> 01:33:35,023
Even she wasn't sure.

1003
01:33:35,234 --> 01:33:37,828
If things went well, then she meant it.

1004
01:33:38,037 --> 01:33:39,504
If not, she didn't.

1005
01:33:39,706 --> 01:33:41,469
That way, she'd be protected.

1006
01:33:41,674 --> 01:33:43,699
She remembered the first time she met Irena...

1007
01:33:43,910 --> 01:33:45,275
...at the party in Bloomsbury.

1008
01:33:45,478 --> 01:33:47,571
She felt a deep affinity for the older woman.

1009
01:33:47,780 --> 01:33:50,943
As if the two of them leaning against
the wall, silently smoking...

1010
01:33:51,150 --> 01:33:53,050
The next time they saw each other...

1011
01:33:53,252 --> 01:33:55,584
...only brought
the two women even closer.

1012
01:33:55,788 --> 01:33:58,120
Even as Dr. Green watched them
through the window...

1013
01:33:58,324 --> 01:34:00,554
...looking for any sign of conspiracy.

1014
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:04,059
Kelly found herself opening up,
trusting the older woman...

1015
01:34:04,263 --> 01:34:06,390
...revealing things about herself...

1016
01:34:06,599 --> 01:34:08,999
Yes, Kelly thought. She liked Irena.

1017
01:34:09,202 --> 01:34:13,730
She was trustworthy, intelligent,
beautiful, dignified.

1018
01:34:13,940 --> 01:34:18,377
It was a pity
Kelly was going to have to kill her.

1019
01:34:33,226 --> 01:34:35,091
She dressed carefully.

1020
01:34:35,294 --> 01:34:38,821
She liked to be well-dressed
when she killed.

1021
01:34:39,032 --> 01:34:42,832
Killing Irena and telling Dr. Green
she was planning to do it...

1022
01:34:43,036 --> 01:34:46,005
... that was the riskiest thing
she could do.

1023
01:34:48,307 --> 01:34:49,899
Come on, Milena.

1024
01:34:54,080 --> 01:34:56,275
Come on, Milena, answer the phone

1025
01:34:58,051 --> 01:35:02,283
It's Michael Glass here. Can you call
me as soon as you get this message?

1026
01:35:03,723 --> 01:35:06,248
As much as Kelly hated her shrink...

1027
01:35:06,459 --> 01:35:09,257
...she also loved him.

1028
01:35:09,462 --> 01:35:13,330
She took a last glance at herself in the mirror.

1029
01:35:13,533 --> 01:35:18,368
Irena deserved a good death.
And Kelly would give it to her.

1030
01:35:18,571 --> 01:35:21,631
Hello, this is Roy Washburn,
please leave a message.

1031
01:35:21,841 --> 01:35:25,277
Roy. It's Michael Glass.
Come as soon as you can.

1032
01:35:25,478 --> 01:35:28,970
23 Highgate Street. Hampstead.

1033
01:35:29,182 --> 01:35:33,346
I think Catherine is going to kill
Milena Gardosh.

1034
01:35:40,159 --> 01:35:45,324
It was almost midnight by the time
Dr. Green got to Hampstead.

1035
01:36:01,614 --> 01:36:02,581
What is it?

1036
01:36:02,782 --> 01:36:05,774
Thank God.
Listen, we don't have much time.

1037
01:36:05,985 --> 01:36:08,715
You're in danger.
She's going to try and kill you.

1038
01:36:08,921 --> 01:36:11,014
What? Who's trying to kill me?

1039
01:36:11,424 --> 01:36:12,618
Catherine.

1040
01:36:16,929 --> 01:36:19,454
I thought I could help her but I was wrong.

1041
01:36:19,665 --> 01:36:23,396
I'll try and get her sectioned.
It's the only thing that'll stop her.

1042
01:36:24,604 --> 01:36:26,697
I've already spoken to Catherine.

1043
01:36:30,810 --> 01:36:33,506
She's very upset. You terrified her.

1044
01:36:35,081 --> 01:36:39,211
I terrified her? She's a murderer.
She's already admitted it.

1045
01:36:39,418 --> 01:36:42,080
For Christ sake, you had sex with your patient.

1046
01:36:42,288 --> 01:36:44,586
You assaulted her.
She nearly drowned.

1047
01:36:46,826 --> 01:36:50,853
You've broken the law, not to mention
the ethical canon of our profession.

1048
01:36:51,063 --> 01:36:52,121
It wasn't like that.

1049
01:36:52,331 --> 01:36:54,458
Michael, listen to me, please.

1050
01:36:54,667 --> 01:36:56,464
You're not well.

1051
01:36:57,737 --> 01:36:59,500
You're the one who needs help.

1052
01:37:04,043 --> 01:37:05,806
I've spoken to Gerst...

1053
01:37:06,012 --> 01:37:10,642
...and he thinks that if you volunteer
for a 28-day observation...

1054
01:37:10,850 --> 01:37:13,819
...you might be able to avoid
criminal charges.

1055
01:37:15,054 --> 01:37:19,548
However, they will have to revoke your license.

1056
01:37:20,593 --> 01:37:21,651
I'm sorry.

1057
01:37:22,762 --> 01:37:24,161
She's right.

1058
01:37:24,597 --> 01:37:27,157
It's for your own good, Michael.

1059
01:37:32,672 --> 01:37:35,334
She asked me to take over her treatment.

1060
01:37:36,676 --> 01:37:38,644
She's my patient now.

1061
01:37:41,080 --> 01:37:42,445
Please, don't.

1062
01:37:46,285 --> 01:37:48,753
You've no idea what you're getting into.

1063
01:37:50,523 --> 01:37:51,922
Tell her the truth.

1064
01:37:54,527 --> 01:37:55,960
Tell her the truth.

1065
01:37:58,130 --> 01:37:59,563
I'll make you tell her the truth.

1066
01:38:05,137 --> 01:38:06,161
God.

1067
01:38:07,740 --> 01:38:08,729
Come on.

1068
01:38:15,414 --> 01:38:17,780
She's right, you know.

1069
01:38:17,984 --> 01:38:20,748
You really do need help.

1070
01:38:26,826 --> 01:38:27,884
Bitch.

1071
01:38:33,466 --> 01:38:35,195
So, what's this about?

1072
01:38:37,436 --> 01:38:38,630
Protection.

1073
01:38:39,038 --> 01:38:40,903
Oh, yeah? From who?

1074
01:38:43,643 --> 01:38:45,042
Washburn.

1075
01:38:49,348 --> 01:38:50,713
Go ahead.

1076
01:38:55,621 --> 01:38:59,250
Kelly Lash kills Irena,
Dr. Green's colleague.

1077
01:38:59,458 --> 01:39:01,426
No, I read your book.

1078
01:39:01,627 --> 01:39:05,290
So you just rushed right over here to save her?

1079
01:39:05,498 --> 01:39:09,764
It's just a story, doctor.
Or maybe I really am omnipotent.

1080
01:39:12,071 --> 01:39:17,373
Congratulations,
the control freak finally lets go.

1081
01:39:17,576 --> 01:39:21,478
This is what you wanted from the start,
wasn't it? To ruin me, to fuck me up!

1082
01:39:22,782 --> 01:39:24,807
Feels good, doesn't it?

1083
01:39:26,986 --> 01:39:32,481
No more "I should've stopped Cheslav
from killing his girlfriend."

1084
01:39:32,692 --> 01:39:35,957
No more whining over nothing.

1085
01:39:36,329 --> 01:39:39,025
- It wasn't over nothing.
- Yes, it was.

1086
01:39:39,231 --> 01:39:42,359
Cheslav did not kill his girlfriend.

1087
01:39:43,436 --> 01:39:45,165
Washburn did.

1088
01:39:47,006 --> 01:39:48,234
Washburn?

1089
01:39:48,441 --> 01:39:52,434
What do you think Adam Towers was
writing about when he was killed?

1090
01:39:52,945 --> 01:39:57,245
You're lying.
You're a lying fucking bitch.

1091
01:39:57,450 --> 01:40:00,977
Sure I am, if it makes it easier for you.

1092
01:40:02,555 --> 01:40:06,514
Why? Why would he kill
the girlfriend?

1093
01:40:08,961 --> 01:40:10,986
To nail Cheslav.

1094
01:40:21,874 --> 01:40:23,432
That's right.

1095
01:40:24,844 --> 01:40:26,744
Your seven years of hell.

1096
01:40:27,980 --> 01:40:29,777
Your meltdown.

1097
01:40:29,982 --> 01:40:31,677
Your divorce.

1098
01:40:33,252 --> 01:40:38,053
Just so your good friend Roy
could nail a drug dealer.

1099
01:40:48,667 --> 01:40:50,362
Don't take it so hard.

1100
01:40:50,569 --> 01:40:54,061
Even Oedipus didn't see his mother coming.

1101
01:41:01,514 --> 01:41:03,709
It's Roy Washburn.

1102
01:41:05,551 --> 01:41:08,019
Give me the gun. Give me the gun!

1103
01:41:08,421 --> 01:41:09,683
Fuck off!

1104
01:41:09,889 --> 01:41:14,383
Give me the gun! He knows I've got
Towers' notes. He wants me dead.

1105
01:41:14,593 --> 01:41:16,527
Open the door!

1106
01:41:16,729 --> 01:41:19,197
He's going to kill me and say you did it.

1107
01:41:19,765 --> 01:41:23,326
No. No, this is all fucked up.

1108
01:41:23,536 --> 01:41:27,597
You don't know what you're doing.
Give me the gun. He's going to kill me.

1109
01:41:27,807 --> 01:41:29,138
You...!

1110
01:41:33,145 --> 01:41:34,874
Go ahead, then, baby.

1111
01:41:50,930 --> 01:41:53,763
Whatever she told you, she's lying.

1112
01:41:56,802 --> 01:41:58,269
Kill her!

1113
01:41:58,471 --> 01:42:00,996
It's the only chance you've got.

1114
01:42:37,343 --> 01:42:38,970
Let go of the gun!

1115
01:42:39,178 --> 01:42:40,611
Clear the weapon!

1116
01:42:40,813 --> 01:42:43,145
- Stay still!
- Get off me!

1117
01:42:43,349 --> 01:42:45,943
Stop struggling! Stop struggling!

1118
01:42:46,151 --> 01:42:50,178
Stay down! I'm telling you
to stay down. Okay?! Stay down!

1119
01:42:50,623 --> 01:42:52,113
Get the cuffs on him.

1120
01:42:53,492 --> 01:42:55,255
- Call an ambulance!
- Keep still!

1121
01:42:55,461 --> 01:42:57,486
Call an ambulance!

1122
01:43:08,474 --> 01:43:10,032
Stay down!

1123
01:43:38,504 --> 01:43:40,995
Calm down! Calm down!

1124
01:43:41,206 --> 01:43:42,969
Nighttime! Nighttime!

1125
01:43:43,175 --> 01:43:44,870
You'll be home soon.

1126
01:44:11,537 --> 01:44:12,970
Hello, Michael.

1127
01:44:18,944 --> 01:44:20,809
I brought you a present.

1128
01:44:23,415 --> 01:44:27,818
I know you read an earlier draft.
But you gave me a better ending.

1129
01:44:29,788 --> 01:44:30,846
So, thank you.

1130
01:44:43,135 --> 01:44:45,695
Would you like me to tell you the plot?

1131
01:44:50,909 --> 01:44:52,877
It's about an American.

1132
01:44:54,113 --> 01:44:55,444
A blond.

1133
01:44:55,648 --> 01:44:57,309
A novelist.

1134
01:44:57,516 --> 01:45:00,576
People around her just keep dying.

1135
01:45:00,786 --> 01:45:02,413
But the question is:

1136
01:45:02,621 --> 01:45:04,213
Who's killing them?

1137
01:45:05,824 --> 01:45:10,488
Is the beautiful blond novelist a serial killer?

1138
01:45:12,197 --> 01:45:14,495
Or is it the crooked cop?

1139
01:45:15,801 --> 01:45:17,496
Her analyst isn't sure.

1140
01:45:17,870 --> 01:45:21,306
But he goes crazy trying to find out.

1141
01:45:22,541 --> 01:45:24,668
But that's just half the story.

1142
01:45:24,877 --> 01:45:26,174
There's a twist.

1143
01:45:28,347 --> 01:45:33,250
You see, the novelist
never really killed anybody.

1144
01:45:33,452 --> 01:45:35,818
And neither did the cop.

1145
01:45:36,021 --> 01:45:39,047
The real killer all along...

1146
01:45:39,258 --> 01:45:41,021
...was the shrink.

1147
01:45:56,909 --> 01:46:00,037
Yeah, from the moment he saw her...

1148
01:46:00,245 --> 01:46:04,614
...he knew she was the smoke screen
he was looking for.

1149
01:46:08,487 --> 01:46:11,320
His best opportunity to get even.

1150
01:46:14,259 --> 01:46:15,453
First...

1151
01:46:16,662 --> 01:46:20,826
...he'd deal with that scumbag
journalist.

1152
01:46:22,935 --> 01:46:27,167
You see, you don't just go around
stealing another man's wife.

1153
01:46:30,509 --> 01:46:31,976
It's humiliating.

1154
01:46:39,017 --> 01:46:42,043
Not that she was a complete innocent.

1155
01:46:42,254 --> 01:46:44,119
That weekend slut.

1156
01:46:46,325 --> 01:46:51,456
Jesus, how could she
let that sleazebag touch her?

1157
01:46:57,636 --> 01:46:59,001
It's hurtful.

1158
01:47:00,906 --> 01:47:04,205
And there's some hurts you don't just get over.

1159
01:47:09,381 --> 01:47:10,746
Jealousy.

1160
01:47:14,720 --> 01:47:17,951
Jealousy can make us do crazy things.

1161
01:47:27,833 --> 01:47:29,892
But getting away with it...

1162
01:47:33,605 --> 01:47:35,766
...that was genius.

1163
01:47:38,010 --> 01:47:40,570
"Unfit to stand trial."

1164
01:47:41,980 --> 01:47:45,040
No prison for him, just a happy ending...

1165
01:47:45,417 --> 01:47:50,787
...in a quiet, sunlit, peaceful
psychiatric institute.

1166
01:47:58,564 --> 01:48:02,523
Of course, that could all be a fiction.

1167
01:48:05,103 --> 01:48:07,731
He might really be insane.

1168
01:48:41,306 --> 01:48:43,206
Come back soon, baby.

1169
01:48:45,611 --> 01:48:47,203
I miss you.
