I'm Anjelika.
- Marvellously. What ever that we are looking for,
that we don't know what it is,
there has to be a hideout.
There should be a base.
For example - theese caves here.
Theese are just old gobetween.
Well, we just have to go 
from the other side.
There's another way.
Well I guess we will 
go on foot now
Why don't we go from here?
- Why?
Eaven the animals 
won't go from there.
No weapons.
- Weapons?
We are staying on a level.
We work with other instruments.
It's difficult. Maybe this complicated
technics are strange for you.
What's it doing?
Now. . .
It looks safe.
The journey is exciting. 
And it's very strange.
Like there's some force 
whereever you look.
I wan't to say, that this place
is sacred.
We are not in our territory now.
Territory?
Will, look at this!
You should a worned us.
In the middle of the forest.
They destroyed her.
And she grow back.
Why the animals don't come here?
The animals don't drink from the spring.
Sh*t!
You feel this?
Like bread. . .
Like a smell.
Everything is allright.
You are not afraid like 
the others, right?
Well. . .
What happend here?
Kristin came back, to
destroy the tower.
But she was killed.
Awfull story.
They are looking.
One year before the plague came.
- Jake,
we have to check out the tower.
There's no entrense.
It never was.
Anjelika, look at me.
You see that window?
In the high.
After many centuries
she lived there.
She was respected from all Europe.
She was very famous 
with her beaty.
But she was selfish
and the world was her reflection.
It was the weadding day
of the princess,
when the plague came.
The king died first.
He's bride build him a tower.
She locked her self 
away from the horror.
When she was watching 
from the window
the plague was in the air.
When she was ill for 
the first time
and her wonderfull skin started to
resolve,
they say you can hear her 
screaming near the oceans
My princess is not the bride is she?
This is just an old legend.
Daddy is here to protect you.
Ill kill you,you damn crows!
Creepy.
I'm afraid that my instruments aren't
loocate nothing.
Whet's get home before it's dark.
We have to go.
