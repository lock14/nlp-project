00:01:20,432 --> 00:01:22,733
# Mas que nada #

2
00:01:22,801 --> 00:01:24,622
# We came to make it hotter #

3
00:01:24,688 --> 00:01:26,957
# We beat the party starters #

4
00:01:27,024 --> 00:01:28,911
# Bubblin' up just like lava #

5
00:01:28,975 --> 00:01:31,395
# Like lava,
heat it like a sauna #

6
00:01:31,471 --> 00:01:33,805
# Penetrate
into your body armor #

7
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:35,941
# Rhythmically we massage ya #

8
00:01:36,014 --> 00:01:38,119
# With hip-hop mixed up
with samba #

9
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:39,848
# With samba
So yes, yes, y'all #

10
00:01:39,918 --> 00:01:40,844
# Yes, y'all, y'all #

11
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:41,988
# You know we never stop,
we never rest, y'all #

12
00:01:42,061 --> 00:01:42,988
# Rest, y'all, y'all #

13
00:01:43,053 --> 00:01:44,393
# We can keep it
funky fresh, y'all #

14
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,442
# Fresh, y'all, y'all #

15
00:01:45,516 --> 00:01:47,206
# And we won't stop
until we get ya #

16
00:01:47,276 --> 00:01:48,868
# Till we get y'all sayin' #

17
00:01:57,514 --> 00:01:58,975
# Yo, Peter Piper
picked peppers #

18
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:00,326
# But Tab rocked ryhmes #

19
00:02:00,394 --> 00:02:02,302
- # On one two, three,
four, several times #
- Oh, Miss. Miss.

20
00:02:02,377 --> 00:02:04,416
We have a lot
of vegetarians...

21
00:02:04,489 --> 00:02:06,975
so I wanna make sure every tray
has a vegetarian item...

22
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:08,991
and a non-vegetarian item.
Got it?

23
00:02:09,064 --> 00:02:10,787
And they can't touch. Okay?

24
00:02:10,856 --> 00:02:12,643
And if you run out of either,
go back and refill.

25
00:02:12,712 --> 00:02:14,599
Don't just circulate with one.
Got it?

26
00:02:14,663 --> 00:02:16,222
And if you get the feeling
one is running out faster...

27
00:02:16,295 --> 00:02:17,701
than the other,
then just load the trays...

28
00:02:17,766 --> 00:02:18,693
according to that ratio.

29
00:02:18,758 --> 00:02:19,685
You got it?

30
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:20,677
Okay, what else?

31
00:02:20,743 --> 00:02:21,669
- Hey!
- Um... Ooh!

32
00:02:21,733 --> 00:02:23,707
It's your wedding day. Relax.

33
00:02:23,781 --> 00:02:25,154
Hey.

34
00:02:25,221 --> 00:02:27,457
I find a little stress
goes a long way.

35
00:02:27,524 --> 00:02:30,426
If I worry now, then
I can relax during the ceremony.

36
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,735
You're not gonna relax
during the ceremony.

37
00:02:32,804 --> 00:02:34,145
You're right.

38
00:02:34,212 --> 00:02:35,160
You should, though.

39
00:02:35,236 --> 00:02:36,217
It's gonna be perfect.

40
00:02:37,155 --> 00:02:38,561
It's really coming together,
isn't it?

41
00:02:39,427 --> 00:02:41,947
You know,
I think we should probab...

42
00:02:42,018 --> 00:02:43,260
What in the heck?

43
00:02:44,578 --> 00:02:45,886
Well, hello, little lady.

44
00:02:45,953 --> 00:02:47,741
What can I do for you?

45
00:02:47,809 --> 00:02:49,052
What the hell is this?

46
00:02:49,121 --> 00:02:50,462
Why, it's the angel...

47
00:02:50,529 --> 00:02:52,055
just like your ordered.

48
00:02:52,128 --> 00:02:54,493
No, but she doesn't have wings.

49
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,184
Yeah. So?

50
00:02:56,255 --> 00:02:58,491
So angels have wings.

51
00:02:58,559 --> 00:03:00,085
This is just a lady.

52
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,907
No. No, no, no.
It's... It's an angel.

53
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:05,559
See, beautiful,
all-knowing smile...

54
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:09,589
eyes that have seen
a thousand eternities... angel.

55
00:03:10,685 --> 00:03:13,717
Chloe, do angels have wings?

56
00:03:14,428 --> 00:03:15,355
Sometimes?

57
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,346
Always!

58
00:03:16,411 --> 00:03:19,706
That's the difference between
a person and an angel: Wings.

59
00:03:19,771 --> 00:03:21,396
Why do angels
have to have wings?

60
00:03:21,468 --> 00:03:22,842
So they can fly.

61
00:03:22,907 --> 00:03:24,432
No, but angels are magical.

62
00:03:24,506 --> 00:03:26,000
They don't need wings to fly.

63
00:03:26,074 --> 00:03:27,501
What, does God have wings?

64
00:03:27,578 --> 00:03:30,927
Okay, I'm not gonna stand here
and debate theology with you.

65
00:03:31,001 --> 00:03:33,716
So just take it back
and bring me one with wings.

66
00:03:33,785 --> 00:03:35,857
All right, no.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, little miss.

67
00:03:35,928 --> 00:03:37,519
This is a ice sculpture.

68
00:03:37,591 --> 00:03:40,405
I sculpted it out of ice,
then it melts...

69
00:03:40,471 --> 00:03:42,642
and I don't have a lot of them
just lyin' around.

70
00:03:42,711 --> 00:03:45,098
So sculpt some wings
and stick them on. I don't care.

71
00:03:45,174 --> 00:03:46,961
This isn't what I ordered,
and I'm not accepting it.

72
00:03:47,029 --> 00:03:48,971
- Yeah. But l...
- Tut-tut-tut, take it back.

73
00:03:50,773 --> 00:03:52,398
I made an angel.

74
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:53,995
Oh, yoo-hoo.

75
00:03:54,068 --> 00:03:55,442
Oh, not done with you.

76
00:03:55,509 --> 00:03:56,686
Not so fast.

77
00:03:56,757 --> 00:03:58,316
Um, did you get
the appetizers down?

78
00:03:58,388 --> 00:03:59,533
Do I need
to go through it again?

79
00:03:59,604 --> 00:04:00,749
No.

80
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,958
Are you nodding to signal yes,
or is your neck broken?

81
00:04:03,028 --> 00:04:04,750
Oh, yes, appetizers. Yes.

82
00:04:04,818 --> 00:04:05,930
Dinner.

83
00:04:06,003 --> 00:04:06,951
I want this on a schedule.

84
00:04:07,027 --> 00:04:08,335
So I want you to get
the salads down...

85
00:04:08,401 --> 00:04:11,434
even if the people aren't...
My gardenias!

86
00:04:11,506 --> 00:04:12,433
Your what?

87
00:04:12,497 --> 00:04:13,674
- Stop! You're gonna run over...
- Doesn't seem to be a reason...

88
00:04:13,746 --> 00:04:15,271
- my gardenias!
- Why we didn't do that.

89
00:04:15,345 --> 00:04:17,548
You idiot! Stop your truck!

90
00:04:17,616 --> 00:04:19,142
I'm just doing what
I'm supposed to be doing. L...

91
00:04:19,215 --> 00:04:20,425
- Stop the truck!
- Huh?

92
00:04:20,496 --> 00:04:21,478
Stop!

93
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:23,526
- What are you talkin' about?
- Stop the truck!

94
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,191
- Stop!
- Oh!

95
00:04:28,398 --> 00:04:29,380
Huh?

96
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:48,298
Who the hell are you?

97
00:04:48,362 --> 00:04:50,052
Kate, I know this must be...

98
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,529
That idiot with the truck!

99
00:04:51,594 --> 00:04:52,608
I'm gonna kill him.

100
00:04:52,682 --> 00:04:54,088
I'm gonna sue him,
and then I'm gonna kill him!

101
00:04:54,154 --> 00:04:55,081
What time is it?

102
00:04:55,145 --> 00:04:56,421
That's not really important
right now.

103
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:57,438
Don't tell me what's important.

104
00:04:57,513 --> 00:04:58,461
I'm getting married today.

105
00:04:58,537 --> 00:04:59,746
No, you're not.

106
00:04:59,817 --> 00:05:01,245
How long
have I been unconscious?

107
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,465
- What kind of hospital is this?
- Will you please stop...

108
00:05:02,536 --> 00:05:03,997
interrupting and just listen.

109
00:05:04,072 --> 00:05:05,477
Look, my insurance pays
your salary...

110
00:05:05,543 --> 00:05:07,648
so if I want some information,
just do me the courtesy...

111
00:05:07,719 --> 00:05:08,928
Will you shut up? You're dead!

112
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,644
Is that some kind of sick joke?

113
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:13,986
Look around you.
There are no walls.

114
00:05:14,055 --> 00:05:15,037
Hello?
Where do you think you are?

115
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:16,123
Okay, you were crushed to death.

116
00:05:17,477 --> 00:05:18,971
I'm sorry. I lost my cool.

117
00:05:19,044 --> 00:05:20,287
I don't usually do that.

118
00:05:20,773 --> 00:05:21,700
I'm dead?

119
00:05:21,764 --> 00:05:22,941
I'm sorry.

120
00:05:23,012 --> 00:05:24,189
Now, we don't have much time.

121
00:05:24,261 --> 00:05:25,635
- Is this heaven?
- Not exactly.

122
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,608
- Hell?
- No. Just listen, please.

123
00:05:27,684 --> 00:05:29,090
There are some important things
for you to know.

124
00:05:29,156 --> 00:05:30,583
Well, who are you?

125
00:05:30,658 --> 00:05:32,086
I'm an angel.

126
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:38,621
Who put you up to this?

127
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:39,616
Put me up to what?

128
00:05:39,681 --> 00:05:41,950
For the last damn time,
angels have wings.

129
00:05:42,016 --> 00:05:43,357
Wings!

130
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,949
Oh, my God, you're disappearing.

131
00:05:46,017 --> 00:05:47,292
That's not good. I'm sorry.

132
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,555
You were saying something
about important information?

133
00:05:50,623 --> 00:05:52,051
Wait! Don't go!

134
00:05:52,127 --> 00:05:53,817
Hello?

135
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:55,097
Hello?!

136
00:05:59,133 --> 00:06:00,146
Crap!

137
00:06:01,789 --> 00:06:03,479
It's coming in clearer now.

138
00:06:04,381 --> 00:06:06,965
Definitely, coming in clearer.

139
00:06:10,076 --> 00:06:11,057
A boat.

140
00:06:12,507 --> 00:06:14,416
He left the money on your boat.

141
00:06:15,579 --> 00:06:17,465
We didn't have a boat.

142
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:18,512
No boat?

143
00:06:24,505 --> 00:06:25,487
Hold on.

144
00:06:27,417 --> 00:06:28,594
I'm getting something.

145
00:06:31,512 --> 00:06:33,170
- You're sure
you didn't have a boat?
- No boat.

146
00:06:33,239 --> 00:06:34,351
Maybe he had a boat
that you didn't know about.

147
00:06:34,423 --> 00:06:35,600
He was afraid of the water.

148
00:06:35,671 --> 00:06:36,914
A boot?

149
00:06:38,614 --> 00:06:39,596
Probably not?

150
00:06:40,886 --> 00:06:42,575
Let me see
if something else comes in.

151
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:44,938
Do you hear that, too?

152
00:06:45,013 --> 00:06:46,125
Yeah, I do.

153
00:06:46,198 --> 00:06:47,757
Is it from beyond?
Is that a message?

154
00:06:47,829 --> 00:06:49,651
No. I think it's my smoke alarm.

155
00:06:49,716 --> 00:06:51,025
Can you excuse me a second,
Mary?

156
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,350
Oh, God! Oh, no!

157
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,826
Oh, no!

158
00:06:55,892 --> 00:06:56,819
What, what, what?

159
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:58,092
- What is it?
- Uh, no, everything's fine.

160
00:06:58,163 --> 00:06:59,090
No, no, no.
It's under control.

161
00:06:59,154 --> 00:07:00,081
- It's just a little, uh...
- What is that?

162
00:07:00,147 --> 00:07:01,074
Just a little smoky, that's all.

163
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:03,047
- Oh, God. Move.
- It's the thing in that
silver pan that burned.

164
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:04,049
The osso bucco.

165
00:07:04,114 --> 00:07:05,520
I-I-I don't know.
Does the name matter?

166
00:07:05,586 --> 00:07:06,600
It's on fire.

167
00:07:06,673 --> 00:07:08,428
God, Dan,
you're like the worst cook ever.

168
00:07:08,496 --> 00:07:09,673
- Sorry. Sorry.
- Get the crab

169
00:07:09,745 --> 00:07:10,672
What are you...
Can you...

170
00:07:10,737 --> 00:07:11,663
I'm just... It's smoking.

171
00:07:11,727 --> 00:07:12,654
Can you...
Well, how's the crab dip going?

172
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,061
Crab dip is going great.
Oh, no, no.

173
00:07:14,128 --> 00:07:16,397
The crab dip is going
spectacularly well.

174
00:07:16,464 --> 00:07:17,707
That's the thing
in the little red bowl, right?

175
00:07:17,776 --> 00:07:19,563
- Yes. Can you just chop
something, please?
- Chopping, chopping.

176
00:07:20,431 --> 00:07:21,990
Oh, God, Dan.

177
00:07:28,366 --> 00:07:29,575
You know, as much as
I love you hovering around...

178
00:07:29,645 --> 00:07:31,619
and watching me while I work,
how's the reading going?

179
00:07:31,693 --> 00:07:33,546
- Oh, the reading. The reading.
- Okay.

180
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,682
I'm back.

181
00:07:35,756 --> 00:07:37,162
Listen, I gotta run.

182
00:07:37,228 --> 00:07:38,155
Oh, really?

183
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,266
Sorry about that, Mary.

184
00:07:39,339 --> 00:07:40,964
- I just...
- Oh, no. You did good.

185
00:07:41,035 --> 00:07:42,311
- Really?
- Absolutely.

186
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:43,806
Maybe we have a boat
I forgot about.

187
00:07:43,882 --> 00:07:45,027
- Yeah. I mean, you know...
- Yeah.

188
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:46,308
And remember, no...

189
00:07:46,379 --> 00:07:48,037
- driving on Mondays.
- Driving on Mondays.

190
00:07:48,106 --> 00:07:50,014
Right? Be careful.

191
00:07:50,089 --> 00:07:51,071
Bye.

192
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:53,416
Okay, Dan.

193
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,428
Why aren't you chopping?

194
00:07:54,505 --> 00:07:55,814
Hmm? Oh, small cut.

195
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,090
- What?
- It's fine. It's tiny.
It's all good.

196
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,207
- Really?
- Yeah. And most of the blood...

197
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,101
went into the tomato sauce,
so who's gonna know?

198
00:08:00,168 --> 00:08:02,753
Dan, look, I'm sorry
for leaving you alone.

199
00:08:02,822 --> 00:08:03,934
It's so unfair.

200
00:08:04,007 --> 00:08:06,210
You have my complete,
undivided attention now, okay?

201
00:08:10,341 --> 00:08:12,348
Stir the bearnaise sauce
before it separates, all right?

202
00:08:12,421 --> 00:08:13,467
You got it. Oh, bearnaise...

203
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:14,523
No, actually,
I know what that one is.

204
00:08:14,597 --> 00:08:16,058
- Good.
- Yeah, we're good. We're good.

205
00:08:21,316 --> 00:08:22,298
Damn it.

206
00:08:23,683 --> 00:08:24,610
- Hi.
- Hi.

207
00:08:24,674 --> 00:08:26,364
I'm Chloe.
I'm a friend of Beth's.

208
00:08:26,435 --> 00:08:28,257
She gave me your address
and told me to stop by.

209
00:08:28,322 --> 00:08:30,492
- Yeah. Hi.
- Hi. How are you?

210
00:08:30,562 --> 00:08:31,544
Beth. God, how is she?

211
00:08:31,618 --> 00:08:33,178
Ah, you know,
still with the drummer.

212
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,655
You are kidding me.
That guy is a mess.

213
00:08:34,721 --> 00:08:35,898
I thought they totally broke up.

214
00:08:35,969 --> 00:08:37,757
Which time? I think, it's
been like five times already.

215
00:08:37,825 --> 00:08:39,450
Do you know that girl Colleen,
who he used to date?

216
00:08:39,521 --> 00:08:40,632
- Do you know Colleen?
- Yeah.

217
00:08:40,704 --> 00:08:42,132
- Have we met before?
- You look really familiar.

218
00:08:42,207 --> 00:08:43,483
That's so weird, 'cause
when you opened the door...

219
00:08:43,552 --> 00:08:44,794
- I was like, "I think
I know that girl."
- Yeah.

220
00:08:44,863 --> 00:08:45,790
That's so funny.

221
00:08:45,855 --> 00:08:47,229
Oh, man.

222
00:08:47,295 --> 00:08:48,855
Uh... sorry.

223
00:08:48,927 --> 00:08:50,072
This is my brother, Henry.

224
00:08:50,143 --> 00:08:51,069
Hi.

225
00:08:51,134 --> 00:08:52,061
He needs your help.

226
00:08:52,126 --> 00:08:53,554
I don't know about that.

227
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:54,741
You promised.

228
00:08:55,389 --> 00:08:56,795
Well, come on in.

229
00:08:59,421 --> 00:09:01,110
Wow. God, Beth.

230
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,608
Haven't heard her name...

231
00:09:02,684 --> 00:09:03,698
long time.

232
00:09:03,772 --> 00:09:05,909
Um, how can I help you?

233
00:09:08,251 --> 00:09:09,461
I don't know if you can.

234
00:09:10,363 --> 00:09:13,111
Henry's fiancee passed away
about a year ago...

235
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:15,064
on their wedding day.

236
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:16,853
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

237
00:09:16,921 --> 00:09:18,000
Thank you.

238
00:09:18,073 --> 00:09:19,382
I hope you don't mind me asking,
but how, um...

239
00:09:19,449 --> 00:09:20,431
How did it happen?

240
00:09:21,497 --> 00:09:22,991
She was crushed by an angel...

241
00:09:24,056 --> 00:09:26,443
and as sad as I am,
I do appreciate the irony.

242
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:29,462
And, well, he's just...

243
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:30,869
He's not moving on.

244
00:09:30,936 --> 00:09:32,276
I don't think that's so unusual.

245
00:09:32,342 --> 00:09:33,487
You've changed.

246
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:34,736
You don't smile.

247
00:09:34,806 --> 00:09:36,627
You don't leave your apartment.

248
00:09:36,694 --> 00:09:37,741
I like my apartment.

249
00:09:37,814 --> 00:09:39,570
Nobody hassles me
if I don't smile there.

250
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:42,066
He's not letting go,
and I was just thinking...

251
00:09:42,132 --> 00:09:45,676
that maybe if he communicated
with his fiancee, Kate...

252
00:09:45,748 --> 00:09:48,268
that, um, maybe she would,
you know...

253
00:09:48,339 --> 00:09:50,924
convince him that it's okay
for him to move on in his life.

254
00:09:52,018 --> 00:09:53,097
Is that what you want?

255
00:09:53,171 --> 00:09:54,512
That's what she wants.

256
00:09:54,579 --> 00:09:55,821
And once she gets an idea
in her head...

257
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:57,264
it's best to just...

258
00:09:57,329 --> 00:09:59,750
I'm here, so, you know.

259
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,020
Okay. All right.

260
00:10:03,089 --> 00:10:04,779
Well, let's give it a shot.

261
00:10:06,096 --> 00:10:08,998
Um, how do you get
into all of this?

262
00:10:09,072 --> 00:10:10,119
Oh, what?
You mean, like being a psychic?

263
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:11,119
Yeah.

264
00:10:11,184 --> 00:10:12,361
Why? You think it's crap?

265
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:14,248
No. I keep an open mind.

266
00:10:14,319 --> 00:10:16,292
I mean, there are plenty
of things people can't explain.

267
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:17,444
You can be honest.

268
00:10:18,286 --> 00:10:20,457
Not crap, just unproven...

269
00:10:21,326 --> 00:10:23,845
after hundreds of years
and thousands of studies.

270
00:10:25,133 --> 00:10:26,309
But you're keeping an open mind.

271
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,362
Isn't it obvious?

272
00:10:29,676 --> 00:10:31,170
Well, what do you do
for a living?

273
00:10:31,244 --> 00:10:33,631
- I'm a vet.
- So a man of science?

274
00:10:33,707 --> 00:10:35,299
I suppose I am.

275
00:10:35,371 --> 00:10:36,449
Do you believe in heaven?

276
00:10:37,258 --> 00:10:38,403
Jury's out.

277
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:40,424
Wow.

278
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:42,791
See, that's just...
That's depressing to me.

279
00:10:42,858 --> 00:10:44,831
I mean, what a sad and
hopeless world it would be...

280
00:10:44,906 --> 00:10:46,466
if that was the case.

281
00:10:46,537 --> 00:10:49,470
I really believe that the people
we love never really leave us.

282
00:10:49,545 --> 00:10:51,966
You know, they're...
They're always watchin' over us.

283
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:55,039
And then, sometimes,
if we're lucky...

284
00:10:55,111 --> 00:10:56,605
we get to talk to them.

285
00:10:58,822 --> 00:10:59,901
So have you had
a lot of luck with this?

286
00:10:59,974 --> 00:11:01,283
Sometimes yes, sometimes no.

287
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:02,527
I know that's
not very scientific...

288
00:11:02,598 --> 00:11:03,546
but when it works...

289
00:11:03,622 --> 00:11:05,279
it really does
make people happy.

290
00:11:08,356 --> 00:11:09,370
You wanna give it a go?

291
00:11:11,748 --> 00:11:13,089
Okay. Give me your hands.

292
00:11:14,019 --> 00:11:15,328
Does this cost extra?

293
00:11:15,396 --> 00:11:18,177
Do you always use humor to cope
with uncomfortable situations?

294
00:11:18,243 --> 00:11:20,631
That reminds of this time
two rabbis walked into a bar.

295
00:11:20,707 --> 00:11:23,128
All right.
Come on, give me your hands.

296
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:27,391
Now, just think about the person
you're trying to contact.

297
00:11:28,673 --> 00:11:30,844
I am getting something, um,
but it's...

298
00:11:30,913 --> 00:11:31,895
But it's a man.

299
00:11:32,705 --> 00:11:36,500
He's in a, like, a blue suit
or, um, like a uniform.

300
00:11:36,576 --> 00:11:38,614
My father wore blue suits.

301
00:11:38,687 --> 00:11:39,614
He was a lawyer.

302
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:40,988
Are you trying to contact him?

303
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:43,707
No. He's still alive.

304
00:11:43,775 --> 00:11:45,464
- Retired.
- Oh.

305
00:11:45,534 --> 00:11:46,777
At least,
I think he's still alive.

306
00:11:46,846 --> 00:11:48,535
I haven't spoken with him
since last night.

307
00:11:48,605 --> 00:11:49,684
Maybe something happened
this morning.

308
00:11:49,757 --> 00:11:51,131
All right. Look, I get it.

309
00:11:51,197 --> 00:11:52,789
You don't believe in this stuff,
and you probably think...

310
00:11:52,861 --> 00:11:54,932
I'm some loon
who's just wasting your time.

311
00:11:55,004 --> 00:11:57,786
But you know what?
You're here, so why not?

312
00:11:57,853 --> 00:12:00,023
All I'm asking for is five
minutes for you to humor me.

313
00:12:02,491 --> 00:12:03,570
You're right. I'm sorry.

314
00:12:03,643 --> 00:12:04,657
Okay.

315
00:12:06,202 --> 00:12:08,405
Just relax. Give it a go.

316
00:12:11,769 --> 00:12:13,874
Okay. Just think about Kate.

317
00:12:13,945 --> 00:12:17,326
Picture her in your mind:
The way she made you feel...

318
00:12:17,401 --> 00:12:18,709
the way she looked.

319
00:12:18,775 --> 00:12:20,498
Think about Kate.

320
00:12:32,021 --> 00:12:33,963
- Oh, God.
- That didn't sound good.

321
00:12:34,037 --> 00:12:36,970
My assistant. Probably
just shish-kebabbed his tongue.

322
00:12:44,564 --> 00:12:45,873
Oh, God!

323
00:12:47,027 --> 00:12:48,172
Whoa! Oh!

324
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,344
Holy shit!

325
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:57,775
Um, you know,
I-I should get going.

326
00:12:57,841 --> 00:12:58,920
- Really?
- Yeah.

327
00:12:58,993 --> 00:13:00,846
- I wanna check on my dad.
- Oh.

328
00:13:05,008 --> 00:13:05,935
What do I owe you?

329
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,926
Oh, nothing. Nothing.

330
00:13:06,991 --> 00:13:10,088
Oh, no. But l...
I mean...

331
00:13:10,158 --> 00:13:11,172
No, no, no. I-I didn't...

332
00:13:11,246 --> 00:13:12,260
I didn't get anything, so...

333
00:13:12,334 --> 00:13:13,261
Yeah, but you tried.

334
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:14,984
If someone's pet dies
on the operating table...

335
00:13:15,054 --> 00:13:16,264
you don't charge them, right?
I mean...

336
00:13:17,805 --> 00:13:20,771
No. No, that...
That would make me a dick.

337
00:13:21,804 --> 00:13:23,691
Right.
It's a good thing you don't.

338
00:13:23,756 --> 00:13:26,472
Right. Yes, okay.

339
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:29,026
If I ever need any catering,
I'll know where to come.

340
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:30,146
I work cheap, so...

341
00:13:30,219 --> 00:13:31,810
I can see you
why you have two jobs.

342
00:13:31,882 --> 00:13:33,223
- Yeah.
- Nice meeting you, Ashley.

343
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:35,078
Oh. Nice to meet you.

344
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:40,263
Say, "Pretty. Pretty bird."

345
00:13:40,329 --> 00:13:41,789
Come on, say it.

346
00:13:41,865 --> 00:13:44,483
You know, I gave you a key
in case of emergencies.

347
00:13:44,552 --> 00:13:45,500
I think you and I just have...

348
00:13:45,576 --> 00:13:47,647
a different definition
of "emergency."

349
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,141
So, how'd it go with Ashley?

350
00:13:50,215 --> 00:13:53,280
Oh, that. Much to my surprise,
it was futile.

351
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:54,397
You didn't try.

352
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:55,680
I totally tried.

353
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:58,368
I chanted, you know, I played
with an eagle feather...

354
00:13:58,437 --> 00:13:59,865
listened to some Tori Amos.

355
00:14:00,677 --> 00:14:01,603
And nothing?

356
00:14:01,669 --> 00:14:03,523
I mean, she's really nice,
but, I mean...

357
00:14:03,589 --> 00:14:04,963
the whole thing
was kind of a joke.

358
00:14:05,029 --> 00:14:07,417
Well, does she want you
to come back?

359
00:14:07,492 --> 00:14:08,734
Chloe, enough, all right?

360
00:14:10,436 --> 00:14:11,482
Right. You know what?

361
00:14:12,547 --> 00:14:14,652
I'm never gonna help you again.

362
00:14:14,723 --> 00:14:15,933
Is that a promise?

363
00:14:16,003 --> 00:14:18,522
Well, unless it's an emergency.

364
00:14:20,769 --> 00:14:22,939
Hey, you never told me
how it went on Friday.

365
00:14:23,009 --> 00:14:24,503
Oh, what,
with the stockbroker?

366
00:14:24,577 --> 00:14:26,584
What is it about telling a guy
that you're a psychic...

367
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:27,900
that makes him think
that you'll sleep with him...

368
00:14:27,969 --> 00:14:29,429
on the first date?

369
00:14:29,504 --> 00:14:31,837
Well, maybe they think that,
because you're a psychic...

370
00:14:31,903 --> 00:14:33,113
you already know
that's all they're after...

371
00:14:33,183 --> 00:14:34,808
so they might
as well just go for it.

372
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:37,726
That is so your gay prejudice
towards straight men talking.

373
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:39,829
No, no, it's all men.

374
00:14:39,902 --> 00:14:42,388
Gay, straight, we're a real
goal-oriented gender...

375
00:14:42,461 --> 00:14:43,388
when it comes to sex.

376
00:14:43,453 --> 00:14:45,940
Dan, I think they're a little
more complicated than that.

377
00:14:46,013 --> 00:14:47,801
No, we're not.

378
00:14:47,869 --> 00:14:48,882
How's my ass look in this?

379
00:14:48,956 --> 00:14:50,482
I don't know.
Can you get a little closer?

380
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,442
I still have
some peripheral vision left.

381
00:14:52,507 --> 00:14:55,027
# Hey now now,
we're goin' down down #

382
00:14:55,099 --> 00:14:56,593
# And we ride the bus there #

383
00:14:56,667 --> 00:14:58,128
# Pay the bus fare #

384
00:14:58,203 --> 00:15:00,024
# Or we find a new reason #

385
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:01,202
# A new way of livin' #

386
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:03,761
# And we shout it out,
and try to... #

387
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:05,327
Good God, what the hell is that?

388
00:15:05,401 --> 00:15:08,270
Oh, Dr. Mills,
you know this is Beatrice.

389
00:15:08,346 --> 00:15:09,522
Lona, there are other ways
you can show your love...

390
00:15:09,592 --> 00:15:11,534
for Beatrice
besides giving her food.

391
00:15:11,608 --> 00:15:13,549
Take her for a walk,
throw her a Frisbee.

392
00:15:13,623 --> 00:15:15,346
She's gained a little weight,
I know.

393
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:17,325
I've driven cars
smaller than her.

394
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:19,504
She looks like a tick.

395
00:15:19,574 --> 00:15:21,875
The prettiest tick
you've ever seen.

396
00:15:21,942 --> 00:15:23,184
Well, let me grab
a couple of Sherpas.

397
00:15:23,254 --> 00:15:25,196
They can help me hoist her
on the table.

398
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:27,986
Hey, guys, Beatrice is here.

399
00:15:28,054 --> 00:15:30,125
Aw! I call head.

400
00:15:30,197 --> 00:15:32,106
No, I'm not taking the ass
two times in a row.

401
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,489
- Shoot you for it.
- And you...

402
00:15:33,556 --> 00:15:34,962
quit messin' with
whatever you're messing with.

403
00:15:35,027 --> 00:15:37,328
I'm not messing with anything.

404
00:15:37,396 --> 00:15:39,086
I make such a cute doctor.

405
00:15:39,156 --> 00:15:40,529
I should've stayed in college.

406
00:15:41,459 --> 00:15:42,571
These aren't toys.

407
00:15:42,643 --> 00:15:44,202
Oh, hey, just curious...

408
00:15:44,273 --> 00:15:46,923
do animal tranquilizers work
on people?

409
00:15:46,994 --> 00:15:48,270
How'd you get those
out of my cabinet?

410
00:15:50,002 --> 00:15:51,375
Here we go.

411
00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:53,383
Is that it,
or can I go back to, uh...

412
00:15:53,457 --> 00:15:54,535
Go ahead.

413
00:15:54,608 --> 00:15:57,193
Oh, hello,
the reason why I came here.

414
00:15:57,264 --> 00:16:00,046
Um, I've got somebody
I want you to meet.

415
00:16:00,112 --> 00:16:01,038
- Now hoist.
- Oh, God.

416
00:16:01,103 --> 00:16:02,793
Her name is Janet.

417
00:16:02,863 --> 00:16:04,388
- Okay.
- Janet.

418
00:16:04,462 --> 00:16:06,469
I can already tell
I won't like her.

419
00:16:06,542 --> 00:16:08,265
She sounds like somebody
with a dream catcher.

420
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:09,894
So, what,
are you never gonna date again?

421
00:16:10,861 --> 00:16:12,835
I'll date when the right person
comes along.

422
00:16:12,909 --> 00:16:14,468
Okay, well,
what if I told you...

423
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,507
she's an eighteen-year-old,
hot masseuse...

424
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:20,678
with huge natural breasts,
who loves to gourmet cook...

425
00:16:20,748 --> 00:16:22,918
watch sports,
perform oral sex...

426
00:16:22,987 --> 00:16:26,182
and when she's not doing
any of that, she saves whales.

427
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:29,417
I guess we could have lunch.

428
00:16:29,483 --> 00:16:30,562
Okay.

429
00:16:30,635 --> 00:16:32,422
What if she doesn't do
any of those things?

430
00:16:32,489 --> 00:16:33,634
Goodbye, Chloe.

431
00:16:33,705 --> 00:16:35,646
Tell me when you wanna start
dating again, okay?

432
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,508
Two years, five years, what?

433
00:16:37,576 --> 00:16:38,786
I had the person I was gonna
spend my life with...

434
00:16:38,856 --> 00:16:39,783
and I lost her.

435
00:16:39,848 --> 00:16:43,076
So you're just gonna spend
the rest of your life alone?

436
00:16:43,143 --> 00:16:44,571
No, I've got you.
I've got my work.

437
00:16:44,647 --> 00:16:45,725
I'm sure
you're gonna get married...

438
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:48,613
and have kids or adopt
a slew of Nigerian children...

439
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:50,020
and I'm gonna get
to be Uncle Henry.

440
00:16:50,087 --> 00:16:51,166
Um...

441
00:16:52,294 --> 00:16:53,820
- Man down!
- There's a man down.

442
00:16:53,893 --> 00:16:55,233
All right, I've got to get...

443
00:16:57,797 --> 00:16:58,811
Why would you even want these?

444
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:00,826
They're just cool.

445
00:17:00,901 --> 00:17:02,558
They're so big.

446
00:17:04,388 --> 00:17:05,761
I can't move my legs.

447
00:17:05,827 --> 00:17:06,906
Oh!

448
00:17:13,537 --> 00:17:14,846
I'm so sorry to bother you.

449
00:17:14,914 --> 00:17:17,662
I was wondering if you would
maybe try again with Henry.

450
00:17:17,728 --> 00:17:19,004
I mean, he really liked you...

451
00:17:19,073 --> 00:17:20,599
and if
he's ever gonna believe...

452
00:17:20,673 --> 00:17:23,159
that anyone is talking to Kate,
then I think it's gonna be you.

453
00:17:23,232 --> 00:17:24,824
Yeah, I mean,
I think that's a great idea.

454
00:17:24,896 --> 00:17:27,480
I just... I don't know
if he'll go for it.

455
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:29,307
I don't think
he would come to you...

456
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:31,447
but if you would go to him...

457
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:33,623
and you could prove
that you heard from Kate...

458
00:17:34,814 --> 00:17:35,893
But I didn't.

459
00:17:35,966 --> 00:17:37,525
- You could fake it.
- Oh, no, no, no.

460
00:17:37,597 --> 00:17:38,742
I can't do that...

461
00:17:38,813 --> 00:17:41,365
'cause I'm not like a,
you know, scam artist.

462
00:17:41,437 --> 00:17:42,962
This is Kate's diary.
I, um...

463
00:17:43,036 --> 00:17:44,562
I went into Henry's apartment
when he wasn't there...

464
00:17:44,636 --> 00:17:46,010
you know, looking for letters
or anything...

465
00:17:46,076 --> 00:17:47,089
that would have information...

466
00:17:47,163 --> 00:17:48,853
that only the two of them
would know, and, I mean...

467
00:17:48,923 --> 00:17:50,297
Henry doesn't even know
this exists.

468
00:17:50,363 --> 00:17:51,573
Right. I just... I really...

469
00:17:51,643 --> 00:17:53,202
Look, I know that you've heard
the story before...

470
00:17:53,274 --> 00:17:54,932
but would you really think
about it?

471
00:17:55,003 --> 00:17:57,303
Do you really think that Henry's
better off sitting alone...

472
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:59,093
in his apartment
for the rest of his life?

473
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:00,306
Do you really think
that Kate's ghost...

474
00:18:00,377 --> 00:18:01,718
doesn't want him to date again?

475
00:18:01,785 --> 00:18:05,264
I'm just asking you to tell
one little lie...

476
00:18:05,336 --> 00:18:06,741
to salvage someone's life.

477
00:18:06,808 --> 00:18:08,531
Is that so impossible?

478
00:18:15,382 --> 00:18:17,999
Hey. Ashley, right?

479
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:19,444
- Yeah.
- Henry.

480
00:18:19,509 --> 00:18:20,915
Henry. Hi.

481
00:18:20,981 --> 00:18:22,257
- How are you?
- Yeah, good, good.

482
00:18:22,326 --> 00:18:23,373
You shop here?

483
00:18:23,446 --> 00:18:25,135
Yeah, they, uh... They have
really great tomatoes here...

484
00:18:25,205 --> 00:18:29,459
so I just...
Oh, I see. Okay.

485
00:18:29,523 --> 00:18:32,839
Uh, tomatoes are vegetables
that you buy fresh...

486
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:34,540
and then you cook them in food.

487
00:18:34,611 --> 00:18:36,017
I've heard about these, yeah.

488
00:18:36,082 --> 00:18:37,706
I always wondered what was
on this side of the store.

489
00:18:37,778 --> 00:18:39,566
- So colorful.
- Yeah.

490
00:18:39,634 --> 00:18:41,008
How's business?

491
00:18:41,074 --> 00:18:42,284
Oh, you know, sucks.

492
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:44,774
- So it's looking up.
- Look up, right.

493
00:18:45,777 --> 00:18:46,922
Well, you know,
I'll let you go...

494
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:48,397
but, uh, if you're
ever in the area...

495
00:18:48,464 --> 00:18:49,925
you should stop by,
and I'll cook you a...

496
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,374
I'll cook you a real meal.

497
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,650
All right.
Well, maybe I'll do that.

498
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,668
- Okay.
- Nice seeing you.

499
00:18:53,744 --> 00:18:54,757
Nice seeing you.

500
00:18:59,502 --> 00:19:00,712
It was raining.

501
00:19:00,782 --> 00:19:01,709
It was raining
when you met her...

502
00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:02,853
the woman you were trying
to contact.

503
00:19:02,926 --> 00:19:06,154
It was nighttime,
and it was raining.

504
00:19:06,221 --> 00:19:07,595
You tried to steal her cab?

505
00:19:08,492 --> 00:19:09,419
Yeah.

506
00:19:09,484 --> 00:19:11,589
And you two...
You two got into a fight...

507
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,252
but you rode with her
all the way home...

508
00:19:13,324 --> 00:19:15,461
even though you lived
in totally opposite directions.

509
00:19:15,532 --> 00:19:17,386
That's exactly what happened.

510
00:19:17,452 --> 00:19:18,563
And she stiffed me.

511
00:19:18,634 --> 00:19:20,706
I wound up paying eighty bucks
for that cab ride.

512
00:19:22,058 --> 00:19:23,781
Do you wanna go somewhere else,
so we can talk?

513
00:19:25,737 --> 00:19:26,719
Yeah, it's...

514
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:29,214
Yeah.

515
00:19:31,656 --> 00:19:33,478
So I noticed you didn't have
any animals in your apartment.

516
00:19:33,544 --> 00:19:35,681
Oh, well, my building
doesn't allow pets...

517
00:19:35,751 --> 00:19:37,245
but I always grew up with cats.

518
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:38,464
Oh.

519
00:19:39,623 --> 00:19:40,735
When I get a new a place,
I think I might...

520
00:19:40,806 --> 00:19:42,147
Wait. Why'd you go, "Oh"?

521
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:44,188
"Oh, you had cats.
That's nice."

522
00:19:44,263 --> 00:19:47,164
No, that was more like,
"Ah, you had cats. Figures."

523
00:19:47,238 --> 00:19:48,383
I'm a vet. I love cats.

524
00:19:48,454 --> 00:19:50,307
Right.
And the women who have them?

525
00:19:51,204 --> 00:19:53,113
They're insane,
across the board.

526
00:19:53,189 --> 00:19:54,399
You know, they wear,
like, sweatshirts...

527
00:19:54,469 --> 00:19:55,646
- with their cat on them.
- Oh.

528
00:19:55,717 --> 00:19:57,625
You know, "Hang in there."

529
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:00,000
Hey, look,
let me ask you, when...

530
00:20:00,067 --> 00:20:03,776
In the market,
were you, like...

531
00:20:03,843 --> 00:20:05,304
Were you hearing someone?

532
00:20:05,379 --> 00:20:07,265
Um, yeah, I mean, I think...
I think so.

533
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:09,272
I think it was Kate.

534
00:20:09,346 --> 00:20:11,384
Seems a little hard to believe.

535
00:20:11,456 --> 00:20:13,725
I know,
but do you wanna try again?

536
00:20:16,225 --> 00:20:17,598
What do you got to lose?

537
00:20:19,744 --> 00:20:20,670
All right.

538
00:20:20,735 --> 00:20:23,036
Let me just get
your hand, like... Okay.

539
00:20:25,695 --> 00:20:27,122
This restaurant
reminds her of something.

540
00:20:28,254 --> 00:20:30,195
New York. It was snowing.

541
00:20:31,613 --> 00:20:34,133
We went...
We went there for Christmas.

542
00:20:34,205 --> 00:20:36,092
You refused to admit
that you didn't speak French...

543
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,743
so you ordered the pancreas?

544
00:20:40,124 --> 00:20:42,992
And then, later,
after you threw up all...

545
00:20:46,747 --> 00:20:48,404
Hello. No, yeah.

546
00:20:48,475 --> 00:20:49,685
No, no, no,
I'm just eating right now.

547
00:20:49,754 --> 00:20:50,865
You're not interrupting
anything.

548
00:20:50,937 --> 00:20:52,879
Are you serious?

549
00:20:52,953 --> 00:20:53,880
Just so you know,
that wasn't me.

550
00:20:53,945 --> 00:20:55,351
- That was J.W. I swear.
- Wow.

551
00:20:55,417 --> 00:20:56,431
What else?
Are you getting anything else?

552
00:20:56,506 --> 00:20:58,359
- Okay, listen, we'll
come over tonight...
- Yeah, I'm just, I gotta...

553
00:20:58,425 --> 00:20:59,570
I gotta get back into it.

554
00:20:59,641 --> 00:21:00,623
- Okay?
- And we can meet afterwards.

555
00:21:00,697 --> 00:21:01,644
Great.

556
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:04,140
Look, bro, when I see four girls
in matching bowling shirts...

557
00:21:04,215 --> 00:21:05,458
that's how I roll, man.

558
00:21:05,527 --> 00:21:07,087
It's totally true.

559
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,271
Sorry, I'm,
like, totally thrown...

560
00:21:08,342 --> 00:21:09,269
No, it was great.

561
00:21:09,335 --> 00:21:11,243
- With the cell phone guy, um...
- I don't know where to begin.

562
00:21:11,317 --> 00:21:13,291
- We should
just try another time.
- We started out with a donkey.

563
00:21:13,366 --> 00:21:14,892
Yeah,
I have to get going anyway.

564
00:21:14,965 --> 00:21:15,892
What are the odds there was...

565
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:17,681
- two chicks named Darla?
- Oh. When'd you give her
your card?

566
00:21:17,749 --> 00:21:20,136
That's all right. You got
your tricks, I've got mine.

567
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:21,639
- Wow.
- Seriously?

568
00:21:21,716 --> 00:21:23,090
Yeah, but you don't really have
to be tricky...

569
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:25,359
if you wanna pay for lunch,
because I won't fight ya.

570
00:21:25,428 --> 00:21:26,922
Yup. Cat person.

571
00:21:26,996 --> 00:21:28,587
I thought it was the one
without her.

572
00:21:28,659 --> 00:21:29,641
Thank you.

573
00:21:29,714 --> 00:21:31,404
I was actually really nervous
at first...

574
00:21:31,473 --> 00:21:32,585
but then it was so easy.

575
00:21:32,658 --> 00:21:33,640
I almost wanted it
to be harder...

576
00:21:33,714 --> 00:21:35,502
so I wouldn't feel bad
about the situation.

577
00:21:36,914 --> 00:21:37,961
- What?
- Ashley.

578
00:21:39,889 --> 00:21:41,612
- No.
- Look in my eyes.

579
00:21:41,681 --> 00:21:43,108
- No.
- It's time for a reality check.

580
00:21:43,184 --> 00:21:44,231
I don't want a reality check.

581
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:45,547
You don't want one,
because you know you need one.

582
00:21:45,616 --> 00:21:47,655
Tell me you are done with this.

583
00:21:47,728 --> 00:21:48,709
I'm done...

584
00:21:49,967 --> 00:21:50,894
right after this next meeting.

585
00:21:50,959 --> 00:21:52,201
Why are you doing all this?

586
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,513
I'm... I'm helping someone.

587
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:56,168
Is he cute?

588
00:21:56,238 --> 00:21:57,547
I don't see what that has to do
with anything.

589
00:21:57,614 --> 00:21:58,541
Stay with me here.

590
00:21:58,606 --> 00:22:00,033
You, ahem...
You hate doing this.

591
00:22:00,109 --> 00:22:01,865
Yeah, it goes against
everything I believe.

592
00:22:01,934 --> 00:22:03,307
All right,
but instead of just doing it

593
00:22:03,372 --> 00:22:05,608
and getting it over with,
you're stretching it out.

594
00:22:05,676 --> 00:22:06,886
Well, he's very skeptical.

595
00:22:06,956 --> 00:22:08,994
I can't just blurt it out,
or else he'd never believe me.

596
00:22:09,067 --> 00:22:11,433
Today, you had lunch.
Tomorrow, who knows, dinner?

597
00:22:11,499 --> 00:22:12,643
Maybe you'll go to a movie...

598
00:22:12,714 --> 00:22:13,826
channel his fiancee there.

599
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:15,044
- So off base.
- What does he do?

600
00:22:15,115 --> 00:22:16,871
- Veterinarian.
- A doctor.

601
00:22:16,939 --> 00:22:18,018
If you weren't gay,
I'd think you're jealous.

602
00:22:18,091 --> 00:22:19,018
If you weren't blushing...

603
00:22:19,082 --> 00:22:20,193
I'd think you were telling
the truth.

604
00:22:22,217 --> 00:22:24,158
So you like
David Foster Wallace, huh?

605
00:22:24,232 --> 00:22:25,508
I couldn't get past page 20.

606
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:27,431
I keep it there
because it makes me look smart.

607
00:22:28,328 --> 00:22:29,755
Oh. Huh.

608
00:22:30,983 --> 00:22:32,805
Oh, God, is he, like, a friend
of yours or something?

609
00:22:36,935 --> 00:22:38,211
You got me a gift?

610
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:40,252
Well, you won't charge me,
and I'm taking up your time...

611
00:22:40,326 --> 00:22:41,984
so, you know,
I had to do something.

612
00:22:44,805 --> 00:22:45,982
David Foster Wallace!

613
00:22:46,053 --> 00:22:47,613
I love him.

614
00:22:47,685 --> 00:22:49,757
I saw the book last time,
so I figured you were a fan.

615
00:22:49,828 --> 00:22:51,321
I am. I am.

616
00:22:51,395 --> 00:22:52,856
I can't wait to not read this.

617
00:22:52,932 --> 00:22:53,858
Yeah, they're short stories...

618
00:22:53,922 --> 00:22:55,383
so you could read
the first paragraph...

619
00:22:55,459 --> 00:22:56,604
of each one and then just quit.

620
00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:57,657
That's... That's great.

621
00:22:57,731 --> 00:22:59,618
No, this is, um...
This was really sweet of you.

622
00:22:59,682 --> 00:23:00,663
Thank you.

623
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:02,744
Should we get started?

624
00:23:02,818 --> 00:23:03,896
- Yeah.
- Okay.

625
00:23:04,737 --> 00:23:08,086
Oh, before we start, I've been
doing a little research.

626
00:23:09,185 --> 00:23:10,297
Okay.

627
00:23:10,369 --> 00:23:12,823
Some of the things you've said
are pretty unbelievable...

628
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:14,869
and I think I know
how you're doing it.

629
00:23:15,807 --> 00:23:16,734
Really?

630
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,173
Normally, in these readings...

631
00:23:18,239 --> 00:23:20,954
the person that's getting read
gives out unconscious signals.

632
00:23:21,022 --> 00:23:22,614
Like you could
suggest something...

633
00:23:22,686 --> 00:23:25,140
and then I'll
shake my head no or nod...

634
00:23:25,213 --> 00:23:27,100
and I don't even realize it,
but you pick up on it...

635
00:23:27,165 --> 00:23:28,408
and then you get closer
and closer...

636
00:23:28,477 --> 00:23:29,720
until you actually get
something.

637
00:23:30,493 --> 00:23:32,597
All right,
well, that makes sense.

638
00:23:32,668 --> 00:23:34,228
How do you...
How do you wanna deal with that?

639
00:23:34,299 --> 00:23:35,640
Well, I'm gonna concentrate
really hard...

640
00:23:35,707 --> 00:23:36,950
on not giving you anything.

641
00:23:37,019 --> 00:23:38,644
I mean,
keep my body very still...

642
00:23:38,716 --> 00:23:40,755
not change my voice. Nothin'.

643
00:23:40,827 --> 00:23:42,484
Okay. Sounds good.

644
00:23:42,555 --> 00:23:43,732
Uh, let's start.

645
00:23:43,802 --> 00:23:44,848
Okay.

646
00:23:46,394 --> 00:23:47,954
You're gonna talk like that
the whole time?

647
00:23:48,025 --> 00:23:49,301
Yes.

648
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:50,352
You know what?

649
00:23:50,426 --> 00:23:52,694
I'm still picking up a slight
bit of emotion from you...

650
00:23:52,761 --> 00:23:53,938
so what I think
we should do...

651
00:23:54,009 --> 00:23:57,553
is turn our chairs back to back
so I can't see you at all.

652
00:23:57,623 --> 00:23:58,605
- Okay.
- Okay?

653
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:05,644
- Better?
- Yes.

654
00:24:06,677 --> 00:24:07,604
You know what?

655
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:09,709
To be safe, I think we should be
in separate rooms.

656
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:11,691
Oh, but then
I'm gonna have to shout.

657
00:24:11,765 --> 00:24:13,651
Yeah, all right. Now you're
just messing with me, right?

658
00:24:15,636 --> 00:24:17,064
Yes.

659
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:19,027
That's pretty stupid, huh?

660
00:24:19,091 --> 00:24:20,073
Yes.

661
00:24:20,148 --> 00:24:21,195
You wanna
go get something to eat?

662
00:24:21,267 --> 00:24:22,248
Yes.

663
00:24:26,161 --> 00:24:28,070
So, you bring
all your psychics here?

664
00:24:28,146 --> 00:24:29,706
Well, you really should know
the answer to that.

665
00:24:31,282 --> 00:24:32,906
But this is a cool place
that you picked...

666
00:24:32,977 --> 00:24:33,904
I'll give you that.

667
00:24:33,969 --> 00:24:35,430
Kate showed it to me.

668
00:24:40,176 --> 00:24:41,736
You know,
I'm getting the feeling...

669
00:24:41,808 --> 00:24:43,879
like she wants you
to be happy again...

670
00:24:43,951 --> 00:24:45,576
like when you used to come here.

671
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:48,324
I'm getting that feeling, too.

672
00:24:58,508 --> 00:25:00,166
You are so screwed.

673
00:25:00,236 --> 00:25:02,123
- What?
- I didn't say anything.

674
00:25:02,989 --> 00:25:05,126
Oh. Right.

675
00:25:09,066 --> 00:25:10,048
Traitors.

676
00:25:10,122 --> 00:25:13,536
Lying, cheating,
red-headed hussy.

677
00:25:13,609 --> 00:25:14,754
I'll wring her neck.

678
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:19,325
Throw her in front of a car,
throw her down some stairs.

679
00:25:19,401 --> 00:25:22,270
# She had blonde hair,
blue eyes, too #

680
00:25:22,344 --> 00:25:24,230
# And she had
a little itty-bitty #

681
00:25:24,296 --> 00:25:25,757
# Hootchie-cootchie-coo #

682
00:25:25,831 --> 00:25:27,586
You. You bastard.

683
00:25:27,654 --> 00:25:29,541
Whoa. Hey, evening, Miss.

684
00:25:30,407 --> 00:25:31,334
You can hear me?

685
00:25:31,399 --> 00:25:32,511
Unfortunately.

686
00:25:32,583 --> 00:25:33,510
Are you psychic?

687
00:25:33,575 --> 00:25:34,784
No, dead.

688
00:25:35,366 --> 00:25:36,740
Good. What happened?

689
00:25:36,806 --> 00:25:38,627
Drunk driving accident.

690
00:25:38,693 --> 00:25:40,416
Oh, so backing over me
with your truck wasn't enough...

691
00:25:40,484 --> 00:25:42,109
to get you to stop
drinking and driving?

692
00:25:42,181 --> 00:25:43,358
I'm not proud.

693
00:25:43,429 --> 00:25:44,442
What are you doing here?

694
00:25:44,515 --> 00:25:45,594
Same as you.

695
00:25:45,668 --> 00:25:48,798
Takin' care
of unfinished business.

696
00:25:48,867 --> 00:25:50,012
Are you sure
that's why you're here?

697
00:25:50,083 --> 00:25:51,293
That's what the lady told me.

698
00:25:51,363 --> 00:25:52,889
- The lady in the white room?
- 'Course.

699
00:25:52,963 --> 00:25:54,303
Why, what'd she tell you?

700
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:55,352
None of your business.

701
00:25:56,162 --> 00:25:57,568
Did she give you any hints?

702
00:25:57,633 --> 00:25:59,323
How... How specific was she?

703
00:26:00,481 --> 00:26:02,488
Ah, you didn't talk to her,
did you?

704
00:26:03,393 --> 00:26:04,733
What'd you do, piss her off?

705
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,043
Unfinished business.

706
00:26:08,735 --> 00:26:09,717
Well, that's it.

707
00:26:11,167 --> 00:26:12,628
I got to protect Henry.

708
00:26:12,703 --> 00:26:13,685
Yeah.

709
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,384
Wh... Hey, hey!

710
00:26:16,606 --> 00:26:17,588
You're welcome.

711
00:26:21,021 --> 00:26:22,843
Hey. Can I help you?

712
00:26:22,909 --> 00:26:24,152
Hi. Um, I'm sorry.

713
00:26:24,221 --> 00:26:25,365
I called, and no one answered.

714
00:26:25,436 --> 00:26:28,152
Um, my friend gave me
your number in yoga class.

715
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,745
Well, I'm just having
a really bad day.

716
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:33,136
My... My friend died,
and we had a fight.

717
00:26:33,212 --> 00:26:35,763
Oh, okay, okay.
Sure, sure, sure, come in.

718
00:26:35,835 --> 00:26:37,012
Come in. It's fine.

719
00:26:37,083 --> 00:26:38,293
Thank you.

720
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:41,969
Okay. Come right this way.

721
00:26:44,154 --> 00:26:45,713
I'm sorry,
I didn't catch your name.

722
00:26:45,785 --> 00:26:48,151
Oh, it's Kay... eleen.

723
00:26:48,216 --> 00:26:49,643
- Kayleen?
- Mm-hmm.

724
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,246
Great.
Um, why don't you come this way.

725
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,399
Uh, just have a seat.

726
00:26:52,471 --> 00:26:54,380
Do you want a drink or anything?

727
00:26:54,456 --> 00:26:55,383
No, I'm fine.

728
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:56,373
Okay, great.

729
00:26:56,439 --> 00:26:58,162
Make yourself comfortable.

730
00:26:59,381 --> 00:27:00,690
Okay.

731
00:27:02,677 --> 00:27:04,051
So, you talk to dead people?

732
00:27:04,118 --> 00:27:06,124
Well, I can't promise results...

733
00:27:06,197 --> 00:27:08,106
but, yes,
I have had some success.

734
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:10,088
Comes in nice and clear, huh?

735
00:27:10,164 --> 00:27:11,091
No mistaking it?

736
00:27:11,155 --> 00:27:12,267
Sometimes, yeah.

737
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,354
Great. Can't wait.

738
00:27:13,427 --> 00:27:14,637
All right, so the first thing
I'm gonna have you do...

739
00:27:14,708 --> 00:27:15,853
is give me your hands.

740
00:27:15,924 --> 00:27:17,865
Uh, you...
Uh, we probably shouldn't...

741
00:27:17,939 --> 00:27:20,109
because I'm, uh,
coming down with a cold.

742
00:27:26,609 --> 00:27:29,391
Okay. Um, great.

743
00:27:29,457 --> 00:27:30,699
Okay, this is what
we'll do then.

744
00:27:30,768 --> 00:27:34,248
Um, why don't you concentrate
on your friend, okay?

745
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,327
And let's try to see
if she can come through to us.

746
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,024
- You're the psychic.
- Great.

747
00:27:44,366 --> 00:27:46,438
Yeah, wow,
I'm getting something.

748
00:27:46,511 --> 00:27:50,305
Ashley Clark, you have made
a mockery of the gifts...

749
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:51,808
you've been given.

750
00:27:51,884 --> 00:27:53,771
Uh, Kayleen?

751
00:27:53,837 --> 00:27:56,203
You speak falsely for the dead.

752
00:27:56,268 --> 00:27:59,114
We have been sent here
to give you a warning.

753
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:03,041
Stop now or suffer
a terrible fate.

754
00:28:03,115 --> 00:28:04,489
Is this some sort of joke?

755
00:28:04,554 --> 00:28:05,830
This is no joke.

756
00:28:05,899 --> 00:28:08,712
We see and hear everything.

757
00:28:08,778 --> 00:28:12,192
We saw you drop the tray
of meatballs last night...

758
00:28:12,265 --> 00:28:14,436
and still serve them.

759
00:28:14,504 --> 00:28:17,406
We saw what you did
in the shower last night...

760
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,068
and it's nothing
to be ashamed of...

761
00:28:20,136 --> 00:28:22,338
but we still saw.

762
00:28:22,407 --> 00:28:24,229
And we see
what you're trying to do...

763
00:28:24,295 --> 00:28:25,723
to Henry Mills.

764
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:27,653
L... I'm just...

765
00:28:27,718 --> 00:28:28,797
You, of all people...

766
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:31,618
should know the consequences
of defaming the dead.

767
00:28:31,684 --> 00:28:33,538
Leave Henry Mills alone...

768
00:28:33,604 --> 00:28:36,222
or you will never
find peace again.

769
00:28:36,293 --> 00:28:39,423
You will lose your possessions,
your friends...

770
00:28:39,492 --> 00:28:42,720
and eventually your life.

771
00:28:42,787 --> 00:28:46,649
This is the only time
we will visit you.

772
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:54,398
Oh, I must've dozed off.

773
00:28:54,465 --> 00:28:55,926
Did you contact my friend?

774
00:28:57,025 --> 00:28:58,301
Ashley, are you okay?

775
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,748
Please go.

776
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:03,765
Well, you look
like you've seen a ghost.

777
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:05,944
Can you go now, please?

778
00:29:06,015 --> 00:29:06,997
Just go.

779
00:29:26,268 --> 00:29:27,609
You'll never guess
who I ran into.

780
00:29:27,675 --> 00:29:28,885
- Who?
- Ashley.

781
00:29:30,138 --> 00:29:31,479
Ashley...

782
00:29:31,546 --> 00:29:33,071
I know so many Ashleys.

783
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:34,073
The psychic.

784
00:29:34,137 --> 00:29:36,144
Oh, that Ashley.

785
00:29:36,218 --> 00:29:38,127
- What did she say?
- Well, it was really weird.

786
00:29:38,202 --> 00:29:41,714
I mean, she got these images,
really specific stuff.

787
00:29:41,785 --> 00:29:43,442
Really? Wow.

788
00:29:43,511 --> 00:29:44,590
Will she get a message
from Kate?

789
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,312
- Like what?
- Huh?

790
00:29:47,384 --> 00:29:48,693
- What?
- What?

791
00:29:49,622 --> 00:29:52,621
Anyway, we're, you know,
gonna try it again.

792
00:29:52,695 --> 00:29:54,384
That's great.
That's... I really...

793
00:29:54,454 --> 00:29:55,980
I feel like
she can help you, Henry.

794
00:29:56,501 --> 00:29:57,995
Come on, Ashley!

795
00:29:59,477 --> 00:30:00,785
Ashley, come on!

796
00:30:00,853 --> 00:30:02,314
She's not home?

797
00:30:03,412 --> 00:30:05,419
Uh, why?

798
00:30:05,491 --> 00:30:06,473
Are you here to meet her?

799
00:30:06,547 --> 00:30:08,335
No, we had, um, an appointment.

800
00:30:08,404 --> 00:30:10,062
Wait a second.
Are you Henry...

801
00:30:10,131 --> 00:30:11,723
the-the veterinarian?

802
00:30:11,795 --> 00:30:12,940
She mentioned me?

803
00:30:13,011 --> 00:30:14,220
No, it's just
a really lucky guess.

804
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:15,631
I'm good like that.

805
00:30:15,698 --> 00:30:17,072
I'm Dan, the catering partner.

806
00:30:17,138 --> 00:30:18,479
- Right. Hi, Dan.
- Hi.

807
00:30:18,546 --> 00:30:20,106
Yeah, we were supposed to meet
an hour and a half ago...

808
00:30:20,178 --> 00:30:22,348
at this restaurant, but
she's not answering her phone.

809
00:30:22,417 --> 00:30:24,074
I know.
I've been calling her all day.

810
00:30:24,144 --> 00:30:25,126
Do you mind if I try?

811
00:30:25,968 --> 00:30:27,528
Knocking?

812
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,283
Please. No, please.
Help yourself.

813
00:30:30,352 --> 00:30:32,173
Maybe later you can come
jab an elevator button...

814
00:30:32,239 --> 00:30:33,831
a hundred times
after I've already pushed it.

815
00:30:36,366 --> 00:30:37,293
Ashley!

816
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:39,431
Ashley, it's Henry.
Are you there?

817
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:42,087
Henry, I'm sick!

818
00:30:42,158 --> 00:30:44,612
I tried to call.

819
00:30:44,685 --> 00:30:46,888
I might be sick
for a really long time.

820
00:30:48,269 --> 00:30:49,578
Okay, do you need anything?

821
00:30:49,644 --> 00:30:53,058
No. I'll call you
if I ever feel better.

822
00:30:53,131 --> 00:30:54,407
Ashley?

823
00:30:55,018 --> 00:30:56,097
Ashley!

824
00:30:59,914 --> 00:31:01,091
Got more than you did.

825
00:31:05,193 --> 00:31:07,494
Hey, it's Ashley,
psychic-slash-caterer...

826
00:31:07,561 --> 00:31:08,837
leave an awesome message.

827
00:31:08,904 --> 00:31:10,398
Good morning. It's Henry.

828
00:31:10,473 --> 00:31:11,966
Just thought I'd check in
since you didn't...

829
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,495
- # This little light of mine #
- sound so good last night,
see if you're all right.

830
00:31:14,568 --> 00:31:17,633
- So, um, you all right?
- # I'm gonna let it shine #

831
00:31:17,703 --> 00:31:18,946
Morning again.

832
00:31:19,015 --> 00:31:20,771
It's, uh, Henry again.

833
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:22,660
That's some cold.
I hope you didn't get it...

834
00:31:22,725 --> 00:31:23,870
when we went out
the other night.

835
00:31:23,941 --> 00:31:25,086
Anyway, I was gonna...

836
00:31:25,156 --> 00:31:27,228
you know, come by and drop off
some soup or something...

837
00:31:27,301 --> 00:31:29,472
so, um, maybe I'll see you.

838
00:31:30,885 --> 00:31:33,153
# Shine, let it shine #

839
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:36,317
# Even if it burns your eyes #

840
00:31:36,387 --> 00:31:38,972
# This light of mine is mine #

841
00:31:39,042 --> 00:31:40,732
- # And I'm gonna let it shine #
- It's Henry.

842
00:31:40,803 --> 00:31:43,485
The sandwich was gone, so,
you know, that's a good sign.

843
00:31:43,554 --> 00:31:44,797
Buying a sandwich for someone...

844
00:31:44,866 --> 00:31:45,977
you've never
had a sandwich with...

845
00:31:46,049 --> 00:31:47,259
is a lot harder than you think.

846
00:31:47,329 --> 00:31:48,670
I mean, just the bread.

847
00:31:48,737 --> 00:31:50,143
I started off
with whole wheat...

848
00:31:50,209 --> 00:31:52,096
but then I worried that,
you know, I'm saying...

849
00:31:52,161 --> 00:31:53,534
you're kind
of a crunchy person...

850
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,192
who only eats whole wheat.

851
00:31:55,264 --> 00:31:57,651
I almost went with pumpernickel,
but then I'd look like...

852
00:31:57,728 --> 00:31:59,156
the kind of guy
who wants to impose...

853
00:31:59,231 --> 00:32:01,467
my weird bread fetish
on everyone and...

854
00:32:01,535 --> 00:32:04,086
You know, now, I'm one of those
idiots who just prattles on...

855
00:32:04,158 --> 00:32:05,586
in, uh, answering machines...

856
00:32:07,005 --> 00:32:08,728
and also uses a word
like "prattles."

857
00:32:09,885 --> 00:32:12,154
So the only thing I can think of
is that, uh, you really just...

858
00:32:12,222 --> 00:32:13,431
you don't
wanna talk to me anymore.

859
00:32:14,493 --> 00:32:17,939
Um, if that's right,
well, um...

860
00:32:18,011 --> 00:32:19,320
I don't know, I guess just...

861
00:32:19,388 --> 00:32:20,980
kinda keep doin'
what you're doin'.

862
00:32:22,524 --> 00:32:24,824
- # Shine, let it shine #
- So, take care of yourself...

863
00:32:24,891 --> 00:32:27,857
- # Even if it burns your eyes #
- Ashley.

864
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:30,385
# This light of mine is mine #

865
00:32:30,458 --> 00:32:32,727
# And I'm gonna let it shine #

866
00:32:33,656 --> 00:32:35,117
There you are.

867
00:32:35,193 --> 00:32:36,272
Why have you been avoiding
my brother?

868
00:32:36,344 --> 00:32:37,935
Uh, I can explain.

869
00:32:38,007 --> 00:32:39,021
Um...

870
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:44,403
I guess I can't explain.

871
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:45,418
Okay,
if you didn't wanna do this...

872
00:32:45,495 --> 00:32:46,422
you should've just said so...

873
00:32:46,486 --> 00:32:47,564
but to lead him on
and let him think...

874
00:32:47,638 --> 00:32:49,198
that you can help him
and then just disappear?

875
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:51,600
I mean, he's worse off,
if that's possible.

876
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:52,684
I just couldn't do it anymore,
all right?

877
00:32:52,758 --> 00:32:53,685
I'm sorry.

878
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:55,025
Please tell him I'm sorry.

879
00:32:55,093 --> 00:32:56,205
Did you run out of things
to say?

880
00:32:56,277 --> 00:32:57,204
- No, it's not that.
It's not that.
- Because I have...

881
00:32:57,268 --> 00:32:58,195
- It's not...
- more information.

882
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,634
I have letters
and some pictures and...

883
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,226
- Is that her?
- Yeah, that's Kate.

884
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:07,878
Oh, God!

885
00:33:07,954 --> 00:33:08,881
Wait, what do...
What does that mean?

886
00:33:08,946 --> 00:33:10,636
Do... Do you want the letters?

887
00:33:10,706 --> 00:33:13,389
All right, show's over.

888
00:33:14,449 --> 00:33:16,271
Come out. I know who you are...

889
00:33:16,338 --> 00:33:17,265
Kate.

890
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:18,538
- Boo.
- God.

891
00:33:19,408 --> 00:33:22,222
God, it's really you.
This is unbelievable.

892
00:33:22,288 --> 00:33:23,749
- Are you really like a...
- Ghost?

893
00:33:24,687 --> 00:33:25,864
It's the only way
I can explain it.

894
00:33:25,936 --> 00:33:27,113
That is awesome.

895
00:33:28,014 --> 00:33:29,355
Here, catch.

896
00:33:33,422 --> 00:33:34,349
Nice throw.

897
00:33:34,415 --> 00:33:35,461
Crap.

898
00:33:36,525 --> 00:33:38,247
Hey, what was that
the other day, man?

899
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:40,388
I was just trying to help out
the situation.

900
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:41,387
Help?

901
00:33:41,452 --> 00:33:43,012
You were helping yourself
to Henry.

902
00:33:44,236 --> 00:33:45,217
Okay, so, like, I'm like...

903
00:33:45,291 --> 00:33:47,396
I'm like
slightly attracted to him.

904
00:33:47,467 --> 00:33:48,513
Well, he's not right for you.

905
00:33:48,586 --> 00:33:49,698
Yes, he is.

906
00:33:49,771 --> 00:33:53,349
He is considerate, and
he is sweet, and, you know...

907
00:33:53,418 --> 00:33:55,240
pulls the chair out for me
when I sit.

908
00:33:55,305 --> 00:33:56,232
Big deal.

909
00:33:56,297 --> 00:33:57,922
It is a big deal,
and you know it, okay?

910
00:33:57,994 --> 00:33:59,618
He's been wonderful to me
from the second he met me...

911
00:33:59,688 --> 00:34:01,313
even though he probably thought
I was a little crazy.

912
00:34:01,385 --> 00:34:02,312
Well, you do
talk to dead people.

913
00:34:02,376 --> 00:34:03,303
That's a little crazy.

914
00:34:03,369 --> 00:34:04,514
Oh, I'm crazy?

915
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:07,233
You're the one who's spying
on me in the frickin' shower.

916
00:34:08,231 --> 00:34:10,717
You're right.
I'm sorry about that.

917
00:34:10,791 --> 00:34:14,020
You know what, girl to girl,
you're gettin' a little hippy.

918
00:34:14,086 --> 00:34:15,580
You might wanna cut back
on the pasta.

919
00:34:17,573 --> 00:34:18,521
All right, what do you want?

920
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:20,571
I'm serious. Why are you here?

921
00:34:20,645 --> 00:34:21,822
Look, we got off
on the wrong foot...

922
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,649
and that's partly my fault...

923
00:34:23,717 --> 00:34:25,178
with the threats
from beyond and all.

924
00:34:25,253 --> 00:34:26,495
- Yeah.
- But here's the thing.

925
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:28,702
I was sent back to earth
to protect Henry.

926
00:34:28,772 --> 00:34:30,559
Really? How do you know that?

927
00:34:30,627 --> 00:34:33,758
Because when you die,
you go to this white room...

928
00:34:33,827 --> 00:34:37,371
and there's a woman who may
or may not be an angel...

929
00:34:37,442 --> 00:34:41,718
and she says that, you know,
just, you know...

930
00:34:41,793 --> 00:34:43,549
stuff, and I just know.

931
00:34:45,057 --> 00:34:47,477
So, like, I have to like
stay away from Henry now?

932
00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:50,038
Oh, that would be so great.
Thank you.

933
00:34:52,031 --> 00:34:53,525
Wait a second.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

934
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:54,973
But you're dead.

935
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,534
I still don't want you
to see him.

936
00:34:56,608 --> 00:34:57,981
Yeah, I know,
but for argument's sake...

937
00:34:58,046 --> 00:34:59,093
I mean,
if I wanted to see him...

938
00:34:59,166 --> 00:35:00,659
there's not a whole hell
of a lot you could do about it.

939
00:35:00,733 --> 00:35:01,715
Really?

940
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:04,473
Then why have you been hiding
in your bedroom for a week?

941
00:35:05,309 --> 00:35:06,421
Well, I'm done hiding.

942
00:35:06,493 --> 00:35:07,866
Let's not let this get ugly.

943
00:35:07,932 --> 00:35:08,859
I think it already has.

944
00:35:08,925 --> 00:35:10,135
You have no idea.

945
00:35:12,924 --> 00:35:13,906
Ashley?

946
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,638
Hi, Henry.

947
00:35:15,708 --> 00:35:17,017
Oh, sorry.

948
00:35:17,083 --> 00:35:18,030
"Dr. Mills."

949
00:35:18,106 --> 00:35:19,894
Oh, hey, you're alive.

950
00:35:19,962 --> 00:35:21,270
Yeah, thanks to you.

951
00:35:23,834 --> 00:35:24,816
You're a real lifesaver.

952
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:25,817
Know... You know,
the food that you left me...

953
00:35:25,881 --> 00:35:27,287
was the only thing
that kept me going.

954
00:35:27,354 --> 00:35:28,530
Oh, you got that. Good.

955
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,974
I left a couple
of messages, but...

956
00:35:30,041 --> 00:35:32,079
I know. I'm so sorry.
I, um...

957
00:35:32,152 --> 00:35:34,388
I just... I felt so ill
that I couldn't talk to anyone.

958
00:35:34,455 --> 00:35:35,382
But the minute I felt better...

959
00:35:35,448 --> 00:35:37,619
I wanted to come down here
and thank you in person.

960
00:35:37,686 --> 00:35:38,896
I hope you're not mad at me.

961
00:35:38,967 --> 00:35:40,527
No, not at all. L...

962
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:42,190
I'm sorry that I called
and bothered you.

963
00:35:42,262 --> 00:35:43,788
I mean, you said that you'd call
when you felt better...

964
00:35:43,862 --> 00:35:45,356
and here you are.

965
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:46,771
Do you wanna go out tonight?

966
00:35:50,389 --> 00:35:52,176
Yeah. All right. I'd love to.

967
00:35:52,244 --> 00:35:53,738
Okay, great.

968
00:35:53,812 --> 00:35:55,240
Oh, great. Oh, great.

969
00:35:55,315 --> 00:35:57,649
I'll let you get back
to saving animals' lives...

970
00:35:57,716 --> 00:35:59,176
and everything.

971
00:35:59,251 --> 00:36:00,363
Okay.

972
00:36:08,945 --> 00:36:10,603
And what seems to be
the trouble with Margaret?

973
00:36:10,673 --> 00:36:12,013
Ltchy ass.

974
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,225
Excellent.

975
00:36:29,614 --> 00:36:30,541
Oh!

976
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:32,165
Oh, God!

977
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:34,347
Ashley, hello.

978
00:36:34,413 --> 00:36:35,722
What was that crash?
I heard a crash.

979
00:36:36,908 --> 00:36:38,020
- Ashley, hello.
- Shit.

980
00:36:38,093 --> 00:36:39,368
What is going on?
Is there someone there?

981
00:36:39,435 --> 00:36:40,362
Is someone at your place?

982
00:36:40,427 --> 00:36:41,354
- Hello.
- You know what...

983
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:43,175
- Hello!
- I'm callin' the police.

984
00:36:43,243 --> 00:36:44,803
I'm giving you ten seconds
to pick up.

985
00:36:44,874 --> 00:36:49,542
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,
five, four, three, two, one.

986
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:51,235
Dan. Sorry.

987
00:36:51,305 --> 00:36:52,710
The phone scared me,
so I killed it.

988
00:36:52,777 --> 00:36:54,533
What's going on?
Where have you been?

989
00:36:54,601 --> 00:36:56,423
- Why haven't you talked to me?
- It's a long story.

990
00:36:56,489 --> 00:36:57,568
I've got time.

991
00:36:57,641 --> 00:36:58,818
L... I can't talk right now.

992
00:36:58,889 --> 00:36:59,815
Why don't you
come over tomorrow...

993
00:36:59,879 --> 00:37:01,089
we'll work on the Spencer party.
I got to go.

994
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,174
Where are you off to?

995
00:37:02,248 --> 00:37:03,773
The gym. Okay?
I got to go. Bye.

996
00:37:03,911 --> 00:37:05,765
- Oh, wait, Dan!
- Yeah?

997
00:37:05,831 --> 00:37:07,140
Would you say I'm hippy?

998
00:37:08,007 --> 00:37:10,209
# Goddess on the mountain top #

999
00:37:10,278 --> 00:37:12,928
# Burning like a silver flame #

1000
00:37:12,998 --> 00:37:15,517
# The summit
of beauty and love #

1001
00:37:15,588 --> 00:37:16,733
# And Venus was her name #

1002
00:37:16,805 --> 00:37:18,114
# Whoa #

1003
00:37:19,749 --> 00:37:21,340
There's a gas leak
in the building.

1004
00:37:21,412 --> 00:37:23,102
Everyone get out now.

1005
00:37:23,172 --> 00:37:24,381
This is an emergency.

1006
00:37:29,059 --> 00:37:30,552
It'll be fine
if we just don't freak out!

1007
00:37:30,626 --> 00:37:32,120
It's all right! It's okay!

1008
00:37:32,194 --> 00:37:34,080
We'll be right
if we just stay cool!

1009
00:37:34,145 --> 00:37:36,414
Just stay cool, guys!
Just don't light a match!

1010
00:37:38,625 --> 00:37:40,053
What... Everyone out!

1011
00:37:42,432 --> 00:37:43,359
Oh, no.

1012
00:37:43,424 --> 00:37:44,699
- Miss?
- The...

1013
00:37:44,767 --> 00:37:46,261
It was just the P.A.

1014
00:37:47,423 --> 00:37:48,568
Was there an announcement
on the P. A?

1015
00:37:49,951 --> 00:37:51,095
What P. A?

1016
00:37:51,166 --> 00:37:55,059
Stairmaster's open,
you know, for your... Mm-hmm.

1017
00:37:55,677 --> 00:37:57,619
Miss.

1018
00:37:57,693 --> 00:38:00,148
Yeah. I was just...

1019
00:38:00,221 --> 00:38:02,489
Well, look at me, hmm?

1020
00:38:02,557 --> 00:38:04,182
Naked in there, okay.

1021
00:38:04,252 --> 00:38:06,290
Just kidding.
Sorry about that, you guys.

1022
00:38:06,363 --> 00:38:07,606
I'm crazy.

1023
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:12,084
So, do you have any idea
where you wanna eat?

1024
00:38:12,155 --> 00:38:13,082
Um, no.

1025
00:38:13,146 --> 00:38:14,770
I mean, if you have a place...
some place in mind or...

1026
00:38:14,842 --> 00:38:16,434
No, it's your treat,
so, you know...

1027
00:38:16,506 --> 00:38:17,433
I'm gonna let you choose.

1028
00:38:17,498 --> 00:38:21,043
Oh, well, in that case, I just...
I know just the place, actually.

1029
00:38:21,689 --> 00:38:22,768
No, I was... I was kidding.

1030
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,767
Do you wanna get some seafood?

1031
00:38:23,833 --> 00:38:24,911
Oh, no, no, big talker...

1032
00:38:24,984 --> 00:38:26,871
you're now gonna eat
a hot dog out of a cart.

1033
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,680
- Hey.
- Sor... Oh, sorry.

1034
00:38:29,751 --> 00:38:31,343
Uh, one Italian sausage.

1035
00:38:32,087 --> 00:38:33,777
- Thank you.
- No, make it two.

1036
00:38:33,846 --> 00:38:35,251
If you're sure you wouldn't
rather have seafood.

1037
00:38:35,318 --> 00:38:36,659
No, we're...
No, we're fine with the two.

1038
00:38:36,726 --> 00:38:38,154
Two Italian sausage.
Thank you.

1039
00:38:41,206 --> 00:38:42,928
Are you going to treat me
to a funnel cake, too?

1040
00:38:42,997 --> 00:38:44,306
Only if you're a good boy.

1041
00:38:45,876 --> 00:38:47,053
Watch out for that.

1042
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,929
Stop it, please.
It's really not funny.

1043
00:38:50,996 --> 00:38:52,555
No, you're right.
That's horrible.

1044
00:38:56,338 --> 00:38:58,476
Stop, 'cause if you wanna play,
I'll play that game.

1045
00:38:58,546 --> 00:38:59,822
You wanna play that game?

1046
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:01,678
Oh, my God! Oh!

1047
00:39:01,746 --> 00:39:03,883
Ohh!

1048
00:39:03,953 --> 00:39:05,262
Oh.

1049
00:39:05,329 --> 00:39:06,310
Let me just...

1050
00:39:13,615 --> 00:39:14,825
You got a little somethin', uh...

1051
00:39:16,494 --> 00:39:17,704
I can't believe
you're not embarrassed...

1052
00:39:17,775 --> 00:39:19,597
to be seen with me right now.

1053
00:39:19,662 --> 00:39:21,068
Oh, God, no, no, I totally am.

1054
00:39:21,134 --> 00:39:22,181
- Oh.
- Yeah.

1055
00:39:22,254 --> 00:39:23,627
If I run into anybody
that I know...

1056
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:25,286
I'm gonna pretend
you're a German tourist.

1057
00:39:26,029 --> 00:39:27,337
I don't wanna be associated
with you.

1058
00:39:27,404 --> 00:39:28,451
Do you know any German?

1059
00:39:28,845 --> 00:39:31,812
Uh... Ich machen dachen
zeit yachen...

1060
00:39:31,884 --> 00:39:33,737
tick wagen
fahr Fig Newton...

1061
00:39:33,803 --> 00:39:35,559
in BMW en zag.

1062
00:39:35,627 --> 00:39:36,902
It's kinda like
a Swedish German.

1063
00:39:36,971 --> 00:39:38,181
- Yeah.
- Nice.

1064
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:39,232
- It's not. Yeah.
- It's good.

1065
00:39:39,307 --> 00:39:41,194
Yes, no, I think the bathrooms
are over there...

1066
00:39:41,259 --> 00:39:43,908
German lady,
who's from also Sweden...

1067
00:39:43,978 --> 00:39:44,992
that I don't even know.

1068
00:39:46,792 --> 00:39:48,220
Hey, I feel kind of weird
bringing this up...

1069
00:39:48,297 --> 00:39:50,752
but have you thought
about Kate lately?

1070
00:39:52,713 --> 00:39:55,745
Um, yeah, not really.

1071
00:39:55,816 --> 00:39:57,920
I mean, you know
how I feel about all that...

1072
00:39:57,991 --> 00:40:00,379
but you said
some pretty amazing things.

1073
00:40:00,455 --> 00:40:02,080
Can I ask you a question?

1074
00:40:02,151 --> 00:40:03,198
Sure.

1075
00:40:04,165 --> 00:40:06,336
Um, there's no right
or wrong answer to this...

1076
00:40:06,406 --> 00:40:09,601
so you can just be honest,
but, um, are we...

1077
00:40:10,373 --> 00:40:12,609
Are we out to talk about Kate...

1078
00:40:12,677 --> 00:40:16,669
or-or are we,
you know, just out?

1079
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:19,422
Because, either way
is totally fine with me.

1080
00:40:19,491 --> 00:40:22,043
I just... If it's both...

1081
00:40:23,363 --> 00:40:26,711
then it probably gets, like,
a little complicated for me.

1082
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:29,791
Yeah, I was kind of wondering
the same thing, actually.

1083
00:40:29,857 --> 00:40:32,093
I mean, are we out
because I'm your client...

1084
00:40:32,161 --> 00:40:34,103
or are we out?

1085
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:59,313
Oh, great, I'm your client.

1086
00:41:02,236 --> 00:41:03,218
That sucks.

1087
00:41:08,251 --> 00:41:09,177
I had a good time.

1088
00:41:09,241 --> 00:41:10,353
Me, too.

1089
00:41:12,026 --> 00:41:13,040
I'll call you tomorrow.

1090
00:41:13,114 --> 00:41:14,161
Okay, you don't have to.

1091
00:41:14,233 --> 00:41:15,247
No, I want to.

1092
00:41:15,322 --> 00:41:17,492
Okay. Okay, me, too.

1093
00:41:18,424 --> 00:41:19,405
Okay.

1094
00:41:22,328 --> 00:41:23,310
Bye.

1095
00:41:40,148 --> 00:41:41,522
Forgetting something?

1096
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:44,652
Was I somehow unclear
about what I wanted you to do?

1097
00:41:45,524 --> 00:41:47,017
Oh, were you expecting Henry?

1098
00:41:47,091 --> 00:41:49,904
I was hoping.
He's quite a kisser.

1099
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:51,464
You're really gonna
throw that in my face?

1100
00:41:51,538 --> 00:41:53,163
Isn't that tactic
a little beneath you?

1101
00:41:53,234 --> 00:41:54,161
You're one to talk!

1102
00:41:54,226 --> 00:41:56,646
I had to show a room
full of guys my naked breasts...

1103
00:41:56,721 --> 00:41:57,898
because of you!

1104
00:42:00,497 --> 00:42:03,049
That's a nice gesture,
but unnecessary, dear.

1105
00:42:03,121 --> 00:42:04,811
Oh, I was... Um...

1106
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,123
Good night.

1107
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,365
Bingo, come on.

1108
00:42:11,438 --> 00:42:12,365
That dog just sniffed you.

1109
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:14,252
God, I think
the animals can see you.

1110
00:42:14,318 --> 00:42:15,300
That is so cool.

1111
00:42:15,374 --> 00:42:16,322
That's great.

1112
00:42:16,399 --> 00:42:17,958
Wonder how I can use that
against you?

1113
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:18,957
Hey, I showed it to you.

1114
00:42:19,021 --> 00:42:20,361
Yeah, that was dumb.

1115
00:42:21,613 --> 00:42:22,540
I don't understand.

1116
00:42:22,604 --> 00:42:24,873
If you weren't sick,
then what was the problem?

1117
00:42:24,941 --> 00:42:25,868
I can't get into it...

1118
00:42:25,932 --> 00:42:27,108
because you're
gonna think I'm crazy.

1119
00:42:27,179 --> 00:42:28,106
No, no, no. I'll hide it.

1120
00:42:28,172 --> 00:42:31,105
I promise, I'll look at you
really sincerely and say...

1121
00:42:31,178 --> 00:42:32,454
"I understand."

1122
00:42:34,506 --> 00:42:36,894
- Okay. Fine.
- Good.

1123
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:38,180
You remember Henry, right?

1124
00:42:38,249 --> 00:42:39,558
Yeah, yeah.
The guy with the wife...

1125
00:42:39,626 --> 00:42:40,673
that was the crushed
by the angel.

1126
00:42:40,745 --> 00:42:42,173
Right. I saw her.

1127
00:42:43,977 --> 00:42:46,082
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

1128
00:42:46,153 --> 00:42:49,730
Uh, now,
when you say, uh, you saw her...

1129
00:42:51,399 --> 00:42:52,413
you mean you saw...

1130
00:42:52,486 --> 00:42:54,144
- Her ghost, yes.
- Mm.

1131
00:42:54,215 --> 00:42:55,775
Yeah, she's been hassling me.

1132
00:42:55,847 --> 00:42:57,057
I understand.

1133
00:42:57,127 --> 00:42:59,100
No, Dan, this is not a joke.

1134
00:42:59,174 --> 00:43:00,930
Look, I've heard voices
before and stuff like that...

1135
00:43:00,998 --> 00:43:02,458
but I've actually seen her.

1136
00:43:02,533 --> 00:43:03,612
Do you see her right now?

1137
00:43:03,685 --> 00:43:04,994
No, I only see her
when she wants me to see her...

1138
00:43:05,061 --> 00:43:06,206
I think. I don't know.

1139
00:43:07,269 --> 00:43:08,696
You know what?
Never mind. I'm kidding.

1140
00:43:08,772 --> 00:43:10,200
I seriously was kidding.
I totally made that up.

1141
00:43:10,276 --> 00:43:11,355
Let's cook. I bought salmon.

1142
00:43:11,428 --> 00:43:13,249
You... You really believe this,
don't you?

1143
00:43:13,315 --> 00:43:14,329
It's really happening.

1144
00:43:14,403 --> 00:43:16,704
And it's only you.
No one else can see or hear her?

1145
00:43:16,771 --> 00:43:18,493
Yeah. I don't know why I'm
the only one who can see her.

1146
00:43:18,562 --> 00:43:20,471
Maybe because I'm after the guy
she was supposed to marry.

1147
00:43:20,546 --> 00:43:22,105
Maybe that's sufficient
motivation for her...

1148
00:43:22,177 --> 00:43:23,486
to come back from the dead.
I don't know.

1149
00:43:23,553 --> 00:43:26,040
I note that
during your little rant...

1150
00:43:26,113 --> 00:43:28,894
defending your sanity,
you admit you're after him.

1151
00:43:32,063 --> 00:43:33,208
Well, yeah, I mean,
we're like...

1152
00:43:33,279 --> 00:43:35,002
We're like... We're
sort of dating or whatever.

1153
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:36,821
Ashley.

1154
00:43:38,144 --> 00:43:40,248
No, I don't want
a reality check.

1155
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:42,009
This is what happens
when you lie...

1156
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:43,900
about talking
to a man's dead fiancee.

1157
00:43:43,965 --> 00:43:44,979
I've seen it a thousand times.

1158
00:43:45,054 --> 00:43:46,712
No, because I'm not lying, okay?

1159
00:43:46,782 --> 00:43:48,724
I can actually talk to her.
That's different.

1160
00:43:48,798 --> 00:43:50,553
Okay, I was lying before...

1161
00:43:50,621 --> 00:43:51,668
because I actually
couldn't talk to her.

1162
00:43:51,741 --> 00:43:53,365
And also, admittedly...

1163
00:43:53,436 --> 00:43:54,810
I lied to you
about being interested in him.

1164
00:43:54,875 --> 00:43:55,987
So I am sorry about that.

1165
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:57,008
Yeah, listen,
while you work that out...

1166
00:43:57,084 --> 00:43:58,872
maybe this can bubble
into your subconscious.

1167
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:00,116
Run away!

1168
00:44:00,186 --> 00:44:01,942
I mean, you have dated guys
with every problem there is...

1169
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:04,310
but this one, apparently,
has a ghost?

1170
00:44:04,377 --> 00:44:05,969
Yeah, but it's not his fault
his fiancee's haunting me.

1171
00:44:06,041 --> 00:44:08,277
- Mm.
- Look, it's impossible
to find a great guy...

1172
00:44:08,346 --> 00:44:09,588
and I'm not gonna
let a little thing...

1173
00:44:09,657 --> 00:44:10,802
like a ghost stop me, okay?

1174
00:44:10,873 --> 00:44:12,214
I'm not gonna let her win.

1175
00:44:12,281 --> 00:44:13,207
You mean her ghost?

1176
00:44:13,271 --> 00:44:14,350
- Right.
- I understand.

1177
00:44:14,423 --> 00:44:15,797
I'm going to the market.
Bone the fish.

1178
00:44:30,645 --> 00:44:32,433
Are you all right?
Why are you screaming?

1179
00:44:33,332 --> 00:44:34,673
No, I wasn't.

1180
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:35,787
I was... I was singing.

1181
00:44:38,132 --> 00:44:39,146
Thanks.

1182
00:44:46,034 --> 00:44:47,113
Father Marks?

1183
00:44:47,186 --> 00:44:48,113
Ashley.

1184
00:44:48,178 --> 00:44:49,192
That's me.

1185
00:44:49,266 --> 00:44:52,810
I haven't seen you in,
what's it been, ten years?

1186
00:44:52,881 --> 00:44:55,214
I've been
to a few Christmas services.

1187
00:44:55,281 --> 00:44:57,550
Well, next Christmas, why don't
you come up and say hello?

1188
00:44:57,616 --> 00:44:59,623
Absolutely.
I will put that in my calendar.

1189
00:44:59,696 --> 00:45:01,221
December the 25th.

1190
00:45:01,296 --> 00:45:02,921
Got it.

1191
00:45:02,991 --> 00:45:04,005
Well, you didn't come here...

1192
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:06,467
so I could make you squirm
about your attendance.

1193
00:45:06,543 --> 00:45:07,655
Now that you mention it.

1194
00:45:08,623 --> 00:45:13,772
Um... Father, um, I've... I've...

1195
00:45:13,837 --> 00:45:15,112
I've had an encounter...

1196
00:45:16,653 --> 00:45:18,475
encounters with a ghost.

1197
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:19,717
Well, you musn't be
completely surprised...

1198
00:45:19,789 --> 00:45:21,511
that this is happening to you.

1199
00:45:21,579 --> 00:45:22,756
I mean, if you dabble
with the occult...

1200
00:45:22,827 --> 00:45:25,160
you're bound to get
these kind of incidents.

1201
00:45:25,227 --> 00:45:26,568
- I know.
- Well, all right.

1202
00:45:26,635 --> 00:45:28,391
You're not here
to get a lecture from me.

1203
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:29,887
So why did you come here?

1204
00:45:31,754 --> 00:45:32,931
I want you to get rid of her.

1205
00:45:34,952 --> 00:45:37,024
Do you see the ghost now?

1206
00:45:37,097 --> 00:45:38,024
No.

1207
00:45:38,088 --> 00:45:40,870
And this room is where
you've seen her the most?

1208
00:45:40,937 --> 00:45:42,364
Definitely.
This is definitely the room...

1209
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:43,716
where I see her most.

1210
00:45:46,343 --> 00:45:48,415
So, uh, is there a script
for this sort of thing?

1211
00:45:48,486 --> 00:45:50,525
For exorcism? Oh sure, sure.

1212
00:45:50,599 --> 00:45:51,776
No, when you're
casting out spirits...

1213
00:45:51,846 --> 00:45:54,180
the Church doesn't really
like us to wing it.

1214
00:45:54,245 --> 00:45:55,389
Right. Of course.

1215
00:45:57,637 --> 00:45:59,327
- Shall we?
- Yes.

1216
00:45:59,397 --> 00:46:00,858
Yes.

1217
00:46:00,933 --> 00:46:03,582
"I address thee, spirit,
in the name of the Father...

1218
00:46:03,652 --> 00:46:06,301
"and of the Son
and of the Holy Spirit.

1219
00:46:06,371 --> 00:46:09,218
"Come out
and leave this servant of God."

1220
00:46:09,283 --> 00:46:10,624
You don't really believe
this is gonna work.

1221
00:46:10,691 --> 00:46:12,217
I see her. She's right there.

1222
00:46:14,851 --> 00:46:17,151
"It is time
for your soul to pass on.

1223
00:46:17,217 --> 00:46:20,064
"Hear the command
of God himself...

1224
00:46:20,129 --> 00:46:21,241
"who did
walk upon the sea...

1225
00:46:21,314 --> 00:46:23,003
"and extend his right hand
to Peter."

1226
00:46:23,072 --> 00:46:25,373
You really don't believe
in all this hocus-pocus, do you?

1227
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,348
"In the name of God, the
Almighty Father...

1228
00:46:27,424 --> 00:46:29,529
- "that thou depart..."
- Oh, that's not good.

1229
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:31,290
It's working. It's working.

1230
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:33,181
Uh, okay, Ashley, listen.

1231
00:46:33,246 --> 00:46:35,831
I've been reconsidering,
and I think we can come...

1232
00:46:35,903 --> 00:46:37,909
- to some sort of understanding.
- "Let the Holy Spirit...

1233
00:46:37,982 --> 00:46:39,225
"dwell therein."

1234
00:46:39,294 --> 00:46:40,854
Okay, uh, s-s-some of the...

1235
00:46:40,925 --> 00:46:43,290
some of the things I did,
a little out of hand...

1236
00:46:43,356 --> 00:46:45,974
and I'd like to take
this opportunity to apologize.

1237
00:46:46,044 --> 00:46:49,490
You know, the whole naked
in the gym thing, not cool.

1238
00:46:49,563 --> 00:46:50,545
I get it now.

1239
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:54,546
- What's happening?
- "Therefore,
restless spirit...

1240
00:46:54,618 --> 00:46:55,566
Oh, make it stop!

1241
00:46:55,643 --> 00:46:57,584
"Acknowledge
that your time has ended."

1242
00:46:57,657 --> 00:47:00,656
Please, I don't wanna go.
I don't wanna go!

1243
00:47:04,568 --> 00:47:05,550
She's gone.

1244
00:47:08,568 --> 00:47:09,550
Yeah.

1245
00:47:10,872 --> 00:47:12,082
You did it.

1246
00:47:12,152 --> 00:47:13,493
- You sure?
- Yeah.

1247
00:47:13,559 --> 00:47:15,827
I'm... I'm... I'm sure.

1248
00:47:15,895 --> 00:47:16,877
She was right there...

1249
00:47:18,134 --> 00:47:19,759
and then she vanished.

1250
00:47:19,830 --> 00:47:21,204
Well, bugger me.

1251
00:47:22,486 --> 00:47:23,468
Good.

1252
00:47:24,437 --> 00:47:25,997
- Good.
- Very good.

1253
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:32,173
So, you're, uh, finished
with your psychic work?

1254
00:47:32,244 --> 00:47:34,098
Oh, yeah. I mean, it's over.

1255
00:47:34,163 --> 00:47:36,650
And we'll see you in church
on a regular basis?

1256
00:47:36,723 --> 00:47:38,183
We didn't agree to that
before we started.

1257
00:47:38,259 --> 00:47:39,720
Oh, I'll bring her back.

1258
00:47:40,594 --> 00:47:41,903
It's a deal. It's a deal.
I promise.

1259
00:47:41,970 --> 00:47:44,173
Okay. No more of these games.

1260
00:47:44,242 --> 00:47:45,997
- I know. I'm sorry.
- Take care of yourself...

1261
00:47:46,065 --> 00:47:46,992
- Ashley Clark.
- Bye-bye.

1262
00:47:49,265 --> 00:47:50,759
He sounded so serious.

1263
00:47:50,833 --> 00:47:52,687
No! No!

1264
00:47:52,753 --> 00:47:53,735
Did you like
that disappearing thing?

1265
00:47:53,809 --> 00:47:54,756
I just made that up.

1266
00:47:54,831 --> 00:47:56,205
I didn't even know
I could do that before now.

1267
00:47:56,879 --> 00:47:58,765
Okay, time to get to work.

1268
00:47:58,830 --> 00:48:01,612
Tonight, instead of sleeping,
I thought I'd tell you...

1269
00:48:01,678 --> 00:48:04,612
all the stories
of all the pets I've ever owned.

1270
00:48:05,453 --> 00:48:07,492
- Oh, people love pet stories.
- Just... Just...

1271
00:48:07,565 --> 00:48:09,985
So, I'm gonna start
with the first pet I ever had.

1272
00:48:10,061 --> 00:48:13,192
It was a turtle named Ernie,
and I must've been eight.

1273
00:48:13,261 --> 00:48:14,471
She actually had kittens.

1274
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:16,099
She had baby kittens,
and then we named them all.

1275
00:48:16,172 --> 00:48:18,756
And we used to call him Boots,
because he was all white...

1276
00:48:18,826 --> 00:48:20,135
and he had these little black...

1277
00:48:20,202 --> 00:48:21,958
- Boots?
- Exactly.

1278
00:48:22,027 --> 00:48:25,408
At least that's what we called
him until "he" had kittens.

1279
00:48:25,482 --> 00:48:27,554
Then we named him Mrs. Piggy.

1280
00:48:27,625 --> 00:48:30,526
And there were six kittens.
What were their names?

1281
00:48:35,433 --> 00:48:36,446
Was that you?

1282
00:48:37,256 --> 00:48:38,565
The doorbell?

1283
00:48:38,631 --> 00:48:40,036
Yeah, that was me.
Don't answer that.

1284
00:48:52,869 --> 00:48:54,691
I remember the kittens' names!

1285
00:48:54,757 --> 00:48:57,887
It was Willy, Betty, Whiskers...

1286
00:48:57,956 --> 00:48:59,711
Fang, Teddy, and Nugget!

1287
00:48:59,779 --> 00:49:02,266
And then there was Buffy,
who was my last dog.

1288
00:49:02,339 --> 00:49:03,899
But after he died, that was it.

1289
00:49:05,091 --> 00:49:06,464
God, I think that's all my pets.

1290
00:49:07,074 --> 00:49:08,383
You should get some sleep.

1291
00:49:08,450 --> 00:49:10,074
Mmm... thank you.

1292
00:49:14,017 --> 00:49:15,194
Good morning.

1293
00:49:15,265 --> 00:49:17,369
- The time is 7 A.M.
- You have a busy day
in front of you...

1294
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:18,846
- Good morning, everyone.
- So I thought you might
like to hear...

1295
00:49:18,912 --> 00:49:21,082
all my favorite colors
and numbers.

1296
00:49:21,152 --> 00:49:24,534
- Blue, seven, seventeen...
- Good morning, everyone! Well...

1297
00:49:24,607 --> 00:49:28,861
Lime green, forest green,
yellow, one, blue.

1298
00:49:28,927 --> 00:49:30,780
Oh, crap,
did I already say blue?

1299
00:49:30,846 --> 00:49:32,788
You know what?
I'm gonna start over.

1300
00:49:33,309 --> 00:49:34,934
- Blue.
- Ow!

1301
00:49:35,005 --> 00:49:36,914
Oh, God!

1302
00:49:38,077 --> 00:49:40,280
Gettin' tired? Unable to
function?

1303
00:49:41,244 --> 00:49:42,291
I'm fine.

1304
00:49:42,364 --> 00:49:43,291
You know,
you really should think...

1305
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:44,631
about what you're
getting into here.

1306
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:45,627
I don't need sleep.

1307
00:49:45,692 --> 00:49:47,665
I can hound you
every second of every day.

1308
00:49:47,738 --> 00:49:48,665
You're never gonna know...

1309
00:49:48,731 --> 00:49:50,137
if something you hear
is real or not.

1310
00:49:50,203 --> 00:49:51,958
I can keep you
from sleeping and eating...

1311
00:49:52,026 --> 00:49:53,302
- and drinking...
- Enough!

1312
00:49:53,370 --> 00:49:55,758
Enough, okay?
Congratulations, you win.

1313
00:49:57,497 --> 00:49:59,439
I love spending time with Henry,
but it's not worth it.

1314
00:50:00,824 --> 00:50:03,092
Good.
Then my work here is done.

1315
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:05,490
But if you ever try
to see him again...

1316
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:07,120
- You'll be back.
- You can count on it.

1317
00:50:07,192 --> 00:50:08,173
Go.

1318
00:50:09,303 --> 00:50:10,285
Hey, wait, Kate.

1319
00:50:11,254 --> 00:50:12,431
Look, is there, um...

1320
00:50:13,238 --> 00:50:14,644
Is there anything
you wanna tell him?

1321
00:50:15,254 --> 00:50:16,181
What do you mean?

1322
00:50:16,246 --> 00:50:17,935
Well, Henry came to me...

1323
00:50:18,005 --> 00:50:19,215
because he wanted
to talk to you...

1324
00:50:19,285 --> 00:50:22,000
and I definitely think
I can deliver on that.

1325
00:50:23,412 --> 00:50:24,655
So is there anything
you wanna say to him?

1326
00:50:27,893 --> 00:50:30,510
Kate contacted me from beyond...

1327
00:50:31,443 --> 00:50:33,776
not like before, but clearer.

1328
00:50:34,322 --> 00:50:36,427
Clearer than anything
that I have ever experienced.

1329
00:50:36,498 --> 00:50:37,545
What did she say?

1330
00:50:39,249 --> 00:50:40,655
Hi, Henry.

1331
00:50:43,312 --> 00:50:45,286
She says, "Hi, Henry."

1332
00:50:46,896 --> 00:50:48,967
I know. Um, you know what?

1333
00:50:50,064 --> 00:50:51,689
Ask me questions.

1334
00:50:51,759 --> 00:50:56,231
Just, uh, ask me as
many questions as you'd like...

1335
00:50:56,302 --> 00:50:58,276
and just keep asking me
until you're convinced.

1336
00:50:59,373 --> 00:51:00,518
What was her favorite food?

1337
00:51:01,805 --> 00:51:03,658
The three berry cake
at Sweet Lady Jane's.

1338
00:51:03,724 --> 00:51:05,414
She says ask a tough one.

1339
00:51:06,125 --> 00:51:09,320
Um, what was
her first pet's name?

1340
00:51:09,387 --> 00:51:11,721
Ernie the turtle.
She told me that earlier today.

1341
00:51:13,483 --> 00:51:14,759
Her favorite Hawaiian island?

1342
00:51:16,843 --> 00:51:20,158
She's only been to Maui, and
she got stung by a jellyfish.

1343
00:51:22,122 --> 00:51:23,298
You really, uh...

1344
00:51:25,193 --> 00:51:26,175
What else?

1345
00:51:27,785 --> 00:51:28,962
She always hated this chair.

1346
00:51:29,033 --> 00:51:31,966
Her second toes are slightly
longer than her first.

1347
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:33,599
She always meant
to take guitar lessons.

1348
00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:36,004
Well, l...
Why did she come here?

1349
00:51:36,071 --> 00:51:37,597
I mean, what does
she wanna tell me?

1350
00:51:39,591 --> 00:51:41,084
She says that she can tell
that you're torn...

1351
00:51:41,158 --> 00:51:42,881
between being faithful
to her memory...

1352
00:51:42,950 --> 00:51:44,607
and the feelings
that you have for me.

1353
00:51:45,509 --> 00:51:46,588
The hell I did!

1354
00:51:47,301 --> 00:51:49,537
Ow! Oh! Ah!

1355
00:51:49,605 --> 00:51:51,742
- What happened?
- Seed in the eye! It's okay!

1356
00:51:51,812 --> 00:51:53,218
Tell him the truth!

1357
00:51:53,284 --> 00:51:55,617
She says she just wants you
to be happy, Henry...

1358
00:51:55,683 --> 00:51:57,952
and she can tell
that you're happier with me.

1359
00:51:58,851 --> 00:52:00,955
You are screwing
with the wrong woman.

1360
00:52:01,026 --> 00:52:03,295
That's it. I mean,
she wants you to move on.

1361
00:52:03,363 --> 00:52:05,271
Oh, she's gone.

1362
00:52:05,345 --> 00:52:06,272
No, I'm not!

1363
00:52:06,337 --> 00:52:07,482
I'm right here!

1364
00:52:07,554 --> 00:52:09,048
I'm right here!

1365
00:52:09,122 --> 00:52:11,259
I'm gonna be with you
every second of every day...

1366
00:52:11,328 --> 00:52:12,505
for the rest of your life!

1367
00:52:12,576 --> 00:52:13,503
Tell her thank you.

1368
00:52:13,569 --> 00:52:15,989
Thank you, Kate,
wherever you are.

1369
00:52:16,927 --> 00:52:17,854
Are you okay?

1370
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:19,829
You look at it, Doctor.

1371
00:52:19,903 --> 00:52:20,884
Oh!

1372
00:52:21,662 --> 00:52:22,589
It really hurts.

1373
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:24,344
Good. I hope it blinds you.

1374
00:52:25,982 --> 00:52:27,356
What would I do without you?

1375
00:52:28,606 --> 00:52:30,777
You are so dead.

1376
00:52:30,846 --> 00:52:33,779
I, Andy Chris, take you,
Natalia Yeroshik...

1377
00:52:33,852 --> 00:52:35,257
as my best friend for life.

1378
00:52:35,324 --> 00:52:37,178
I pledge to honor, encourage...

1379
00:52:37,244 --> 00:52:38,738
- and support you...
- Oh, you know the Lerner party?

1380
00:52:38,812 --> 00:52:40,240
You're gonna have
to do that alone.

1381
00:52:40,315 --> 00:52:44,307
Where, uh...
Where are you gonna be?

1382
00:52:44,379 --> 00:52:46,232
Uh, I gotta... I gotta...

1383
00:52:46,298 --> 00:52:49,232
I gotta go away. I'm...
Some... I've got a thing.

1384
00:52:49,306 --> 00:52:50,288
With... With who?

1385
00:52:51,481 --> 00:52:52,408
Shh.

1386
00:52:52,473 --> 00:52:55,057
With Henry? With Henry.

1387
00:52:55,128 --> 00:52:56,654
This is my solemn vow.

1388
00:52:56,728 --> 00:53:00,524
From this moment,
I, Natalia Yeroshik...

1389
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:01,527
take you, Andy Chris...

1390
00:53:01,592 --> 00:53:04,012
- What, Dan?
- Nothing. Nothing.

1391
00:53:04,087 --> 00:53:05,776
This is my solemn vow.

1392
00:53:05,846 --> 00:53:07,504
By the power vested in me...

1393
00:53:07,574 --> 00:53:10,640
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

1394
00:53:10,710 --> 00:53:12,050
You may kiss the bride.

1395
00:53:12,117 --> 00:53:13,611
Congratulations.

1396
00:53:13,685 --> 00:53:14,612
Yeah.

1397
00:53:14,677 --> 00:53:15,658
Yeah.

1398
00:53:18,324 --> 00:53:20,047
Three...

1399
00:53:20,116 --> 00:53:21,708
four...

1400
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:23,240
five...

1401
00:53:23,315 --> 00:53:24,242
- six.
- Ashley.

1402
00:53:24,307 --> 00:53:26,378
Shh!

1403
00:53:26,450 --> 00:53:28,392
Okay, where was I? I was on...

1404
00:53:28,466 --> 00:53:30,156
- Three.
- Thank you.

1405
00:53:30,226 --> 00:53:31,502
For what?

1406
00:53:31,571 --> 00:53:35,366
Three, four, five...

1407
00:53:35,441 --> 00:53:39,662
six, seven, eight.

1408
00:53:41,425 --> 00:53:42,352
I have to say something.

1409
00:53:42,416 --> 00:53:45,284
Now, you know I never get
involved in your love life.

1410
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:46,406
- Bullshit.
- Fine.

1411
00:53:46,478 --> 00:53:48,136
As someone who's always involved
in your love life...

1412
00:53:48,206 --> 00:53:49,253
I think you should listen to me.

1413
00:53:49,326 --> 00:53:50,820
You're making a huge mistake.

1414
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:52,170
No, I'm not.
Help me with the cart.

1415
00:53:52,238 --> 00:53:55,400
Okay, it's... It's not because
his fiancee's ghost...

1416
00:53:55,470 --> 00:53:57,803
is trying to drive you away,
and-and it's not because...

1417
00:53:57,869 --> 00:53:59,778
he's a client who you lie to...

1418
00:53:59,853 --> 00:54:01,892
but you talk about picking guys
with problems?

1419
00:54:01,965 --> 00:54:03,077
He just got out
of a relationship...

1420
00:54:03,148 --> 00:54:05,057
where his bride was killed
on their wedding day...

1421
00:54:05,131 --> 00:54:06,820
and you'll be the first girl
he dates.

1422
00:54:06,890 --> 00:54:08,832
That's a pretty serious rebound.

1423
00:54:08,907 --> 00:54:10,816
You really think
this is gonna end up well, huh?

1424
00:54:11,723 --> 00:54:14,143
Nice try. You're still handling
the Lerner party alone.

1425
00:54:15,690 --> 00:54:18,110
Ladies and gentlemen,
Cherries Jubilee.

1426
00:54:28,903 --> 00:54:30,790
Excuse me for a second.

1427
00:54:31,303 --> 00:54:33,026
I could feel the heat
all the way back here.

1428
00:54:33,095 --> 00:54:34,403
- Are you okay?
- You know, if I were dead...

1429
00:54:34,470 --> 00:54:36,608
I wouldn't be following around
one person, okay?

1430
00:54:36,678 --> 00:54:38,335
I'd be finding out
the meaning of life.

1431
00:54:38,405 --> 00:54:40,826
I would be talking to wise,
notable dead people.

1432
00:54:40,901 --> 00:54:41,883
Oh, like who?

1433
00:54:41,957 --> 00:54:44,094
Um, like Eleanor Roosevelt.

1434
00:54:44,165 --> 00:54:45,092
What would you ask her?

1435
00:54:45,156 --> 00:54:46,366
Like, all kinds of things.

1436
00:54:46,437 --> 00:54:47,419
Like what?

1437
00:54:47,491 --> 00:54:48,897
Um...

1438
00:54:48,964 --> 00:54:49,891
All right,
forget Eleanor Roosevelt.

1439
00:54:49,955 --> 00:54:51,547
You're the only dead person
I wanna talk to right now.

1440
00:54:51,619 --> 00:54:53,888
Oh, I think you burned off
a little bit of your eyebrow.

1441
00:54:53,955 --> 00:54:55,448
What? Where?

1442
00:54:55,522 --> 00:54:56,536
Right... Right there.

1443
00:54:58,241 --> 00:54:59,320
It's not gonna be even.

1444
00:55:00,289 --> 00:55:01,271
You know what? I don't care.

1445
00:55:01,345 --> 00:55:02,327
And you know what else?

1446
00:55:02,402 --> 00:55:03,612
I'm going away with Henry
this weekend...

1447
00:55:03,681 --> 00:55:05,403
whether you like it or not,
and I don't care what you do.

1448
00:55:05,473 --> 00:55:07,807
I don't care if you set me
on fire or yell and scream...

1449
00:55:07,872 --> 00:55:09,780
and talk about your dog
or watch me while I piss!

1450
00:55:09,855 --> 00:55:11,764
I don't care! So if you're
trying to make me look insane...

1451
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:12,985
it's not working!

1452
00:55:16,670 --> 00:55:17,652
So...

1453
00:55:18,845 --> 00:55:20,437
who's ready for cake?

1454
00:55:21,886 --> 00:55:22,868
Oy.

1455
00:55:23,806 --> 00:55:26,968
# I'll stop the world
and melt with you #

1456
00:55:29,628 --> 00:55:31,416
# You've seen the difference #

1457
00:55:31,484 --> 00:55:35,443
# And it's getting better
all the time #

1458
00:55:35,515 --> 00:55:37,457
- # There's nothing you and I #
- Ha! No!
- Yeah.

1459
00:55:37,531 --> 00:55:38,513
- # Won't do #
- Oh, my God.

1460
00:55:38,586 --> 00:55:40,690
- Pretty smooth.
- It is beautiful.

1461
00:55:40,762 --> 00:55:42,322
It's so weird
how much this place...

1462
00:55:42,394 --> 00:55:44,248
reminds me of my own apartment.

1463
00:55:46,265 --> 00:55:47,410
You know what we should do?

1464
00:55:47,481 --> 00:55:48,528
I saw some people
riding one of those...

1465
00:55:48,601 --> 00:55:49,810
like, two-person bikes.

1466
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:51,374
We should totally rent
one of those.

1467
00:55:51,448 --> 00:55:52,462
Yeah, absolutely.

1468
00:55:52,536 --> 00:55:53,550
Okay, cool.

1469
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:55,856
Now?

1470
00:55:55,927 --> 00:55:57,585
Yeah, why not?

1471
00:55:57,655 --> 00:55:59,061
We just got here.

1472
00:55:59,127 --> 00:56:01,133
Don't you want to unpack,
check out the room?

1473
00:56:03,958 --> 00:56:06,193
Oh, my God.

1474
00:56:06,261 --> 00:56:07,438
Did you think
that you could just bring me...

1475
00:56:07,509 --> 00:56:08,883
up here and never leave
the room?

1476
00:56:08,949 --> 00:56:10,770
Just put a "do not disturb" sign
on the door...

1477
00:56:10,836 --> 00:56:12,297
and lock ourselves
in for the weekend?

1478
00:56:12,372 --> 00:56:13,778
Um... yes?

1479
00:56:13,844 --> 00:56:15,054
Awesome.

1480
00:56:15,124 --> 00:56:16,399
I'll go freshen up.

1481
00:57:03,947 --> 00:57:04,929
Henry?

1482
00:57:06,122 --> 00:57:07,462
Yes?

1483
00:57:07,530 --> 00:57:09,384
You know I'm still
in the room, right?

1484
00:57:09,450 --> 00:57:10,693
Yeah.

1485
00:57:12,969 --> 00:57:14,856
- Okay.
- Okay.

1486
00:57:32,037 --> 00:57:33,019
That was gross.

1487
00:57:34,213 --> 00:57:35,227
Are you all right?

1488
00:57:36,230 --> 00:57:37,375
I'm fine!

1489
00:57:38,501 --> 00:57:39,483
Okay.

1490
00:57:42,595 --> 00:57:43,936
I should've known it was you.

1491
00:57:44,004 --> 00:57:45,083
You know, I never thought
farts were funny...

1492
00:57:45,155 --> 00:57:47,675
when I was alive,
but the look on your face.

1493
00:57:47,748 --> 00:57:48,990
You get out of here.

1494
00:57:50,434 --> 00:57:52,123
You're not having sex
with my husband.

1495
00:57:53,250 --> 00:57:54,177
He is not your husband.

1496
00:57:54,241 --> 00:57:55,767
And even if you did make it
down that aisle...

1497
00:57:55,841 --> 00:57:58,589
there's still that
"till death do us part" clause.

1498
00:57:58,657 --> 00:57:59,900
You're a ghost!

1499
00:57:59,969 --> 00:58:01,048
Did you say something?

1500
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:03,093
Yeah. The...

1501
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:06,490
There's potpourri!

1502
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:07,802
Don't do it!

1503
00:58:09,503 --> 00:58:10,517
Oh, I'm doin' it.

1504
00:58:17,182 --> 00:58:18,610
Oh, my God.

1505
00:58:18,686 --> 00:58:21,172
It looks even better
on the floor.

1506
00:58:23,004 --> 00:58:24,564
Best day ever.

1507
00:58:36,058 --> 00:58:37,519
Wow, this is gonna be awkward.

1508
00:58:37,594 --> 00:58:38,739
Oh, my God!

1509
00:58:40,153 --> 00:58:41,232
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

1510
00:58:41,305 --> 00:58:43,213
I just, you know,
it's just, "Oh, my God."

1511
00:58:45,144 --> 00:58:47,151
I'm surprised he didn't spring
for the suite.

1512
00:58:48,568 --> 00:58:49,908
- Hey!
- Are you sure you're okay?

1513
00:58:49,975 --> 00:58:51,218
- How's it going down there?
- Why? Yeah.

1514
00:58:51,287 --> 00:58:52,464
- Yeah.
- Yoo-hoo!

1515
00:58:52,535 --> 00:58:54,639
It's just you're closing
your eyes very energetically.

1516
00:58:54,710 --> 00:58:55,637
I think you're freakin' him out.

1517
00:58:55,702 --> 00:58:57,644
Oh, you like to kiss with
your eyes open? That's cool.

1518
00:58:57,718 --> 00:58:58,994
I mean, that's kind of kinky,
but all right, all right.

1519
00:58:59,062 --> 00:59:00,173
- I'm cool with that.
- Being on the bottom...

1520
00:59:00,245 --> 00:59:01,455
not your most flattering angle.

1521
00:59:02,805 --> 00:59:04,113
I was talking to another ghost
the other day...

1522
00:59:04,180 --> 00:59:05,838
and you'll never guess
who it was.

1523
00:59:05,908 --> 00:59:06,955
Remember that guy you
used to date in high school...

1524
00:59:07,028 --> 00:59:08,751
who got killed
in a motorcycle accident?

1525
00:59:08,821 --> 00:59:09,835
Ted?

1526
00:59:09,908 --> 00:59:11,117
- What?
- What?

1527
00:59:11,187 --> 00:59:12,463
You said Ted.

1528
00:59:12,531 --> 00:59:13,936
No, I didn't.

1529
00:59:14,002 --> 00:59:16,074
I just... I, um...
'cause I bumped my arm.

1530
00:59:16,147 --> 00:59:17,074
I'm okay now.

1531
00:59:17,138 --> 00:59:19,112
Anyway, this is
a little embarrassing...

1532
00:59:19,186 --> 00:59:21,192
but he said
you were a bad kisser.

1533
00:59:21,265 --> 00:59:23,468
Actually, he said you were
the worst kisser ever.

1534
00:59:23,537 --> 00:59:25,096
"Painful and overly wet,"
was his exact quote.

1535
00:59:25,168 --> 00:59:27,077
He made a noise like this.

1536
00:59:27,153 --> 00:59:28,713
- Talk dirty to me.
- What?

1537
00:59:28,784 --> 00:59:30,540
Talk dirty to me.
I love it. It turns me on.

1538
00:59:30,608 --> 00:59:31,817
Henry doesn't like that.

1539
00:59:31,887 --> 00:59:32,999
Do it loud.

1540
00:59:33,072 --> 00:59:35,754
Um... Oh, you're a dirty girl,
aren't you?

1541
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:37,098
She's a dirty little liar
is what she is.

1542
00:59:37,167 --> 00:59:38,661
Louder.

1543
00:59:38,734 --> 00:59:40,457
You're a dirty little thing.

1544
00:59:40,527 --> 00:59:41,474
You're a dirty girl...

1545
00:59:41,550 --> 00:59:43,338
- # I believe the children #
- aren't you?

1546
00:59:43,406 --> 00:59:44,746
- # Are our future #
- You're a dirty girl.

1547
00:59:44,812 --> 00:59:46,121
- Good, good. Louder
though, louder.
- # Teach them well #

1548
00:59:46,189 --> 00:59:48,523
- Like... Like you're trying to
drown out some annoying noise
- # And let them lead the way #

1549
00:59:48,588 --> 00:59:49,733
- # Show them all #
- Like this?!

1550
00:59:49,804 --> 00:59:50,752
- # The beauty #
- Yeah!

1551
00:59:50,829 --> 00:59:52,486
- # They possess inside #
- You're a dirty little girl,
aren't you?

1552
00:59:52,556 --> 00:59:54,312
- Louder, please!
- Aren't you
a dirty little thing?!

1553
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:55,361
You like the dirty stuff!

1554
00:59:55,435 --> 00:59:57,344
Aren't you a dirty...
That's just stupid.

1555
00:59:57,419 --> 00:59:58,498
I'm just yelling at you.

1556
01:00:01,099 --> 01:00:02,559
- Music!
- Is that annoying?

1557
01:00:06,665 --> 01:00:07,810
It's a little loud.

1558
01:00:07,881 --> 01:00:08,960
What?!

1559
01:00:09,033 --> 01:00:10,461
The music.
You like it this loud?

1560
01:00:10,537 --> 01:00:11,519
Oh, yeah, I love it.

1561
01:00:11,593 --> 01:00:13,217
Love this. Salsa.

1562
01:00:13,288 --> 01:00:15,196
Salsa makes me horny!

1563
01:00:20,103 --> 01:00:21,477
No, no, no, no!

1564
01:00:21,543 --> 01:00:22,687
Come on, just anything.

1565
01:00:22,758 --> 01:00:23,685
I like your hair!

1566
01:00:23,750 --> 01:00:24,829
Oh, God, I love it!

1567
01:00:24,902 --> 01:00:26,362
- It's looks really good!
- Louder!

1568
01:00:26,437 --> 01:00:27,484
Really?!

1569
01:00:30,310 --> 01:00:31,553
Sorry, sorry.

1570
01:00:31,622 --> 01:00:32,864
- Oh, hey.
- Hi.

1571
01:00:32,933 --> 01:00:34,339
- How you doin'?
- I'm good.

1572
01:00:35,140 --> 01:00:36,316
So, what's up?

1573
01:00:36,387 --> 01:00:37,947
You know that woman
you sent me to...

1574
01:00:38,019 --> 01:00:39,480
the, uh, psychic?

1575
01:00:39,556 --> 01:00:40,538
Believe me, you don't have
to whisper that...

1576
01:00:40,612 --> 01:00:41,539
in this neighborhood.

1577
01:00:41,603 --> 01:00:42,812
I mean, it's not like
I sent you to a...

1578
01:00:44,195 --> 01:00:45,209
Republican.

1579
01:00:46,529 --> 01:00:48,798
Well, She's, um... She's great.

1580
01:00:48,865 --> 01:00:50,970
I mean, really, I feel
a thousand times better.

1581
01:00:51,041 --> 01:00:53,047
Did she get a message from Kate?

1582
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:55,127
Yeah, and I think that Kate
really wants me to move on.

1583
01:00:56,191 --> 01:00:57,238
In fact, I'm dating her.

1584
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:58,847
Who?

1585
01:00:58,911 --> 01:01:00,023
Ashley.

1586
01:01:00,096 --> 01:01:01,502
Wait, so she told you
that Kate said...

1587
01:01:01,568 --> 01:01:03,192
that she wants you
to start dating again...

1588
01:01:03,262 --> 01:01:05,116
and then she went out with you?

1589
01:01:05,182 --> 01:01:06,707
Well, it didn't happen
exactly like that, but...

1590
01:01:06,782 --> 01:01:08,570
Oh, yeah,
I guess that is...

1591
01:01:08,638 --> 01:01:09,750
how it happened exactly, but...

1592
01:01:10,398 --> 01:01:11,380
Well, you got to stop.

1593
01:01:11,454 --> 01:01:12,697
Why?

1594
01:01:12,766 --> 01:01:13,910
She's a psychic.

1595
01:01:13,981 --> 01:01:15,475
Since when do you have
a problem with psychics?

1596
01:01:15,549 --> 01:01:16,562
L... You do.

1597
01:01:16,635 --> 01:01:18,009
You do. You hate them.

1598
01:01:18,076 --> 01:01:19,537
Look, Henry,
I think it's great...

1599
01:01:19,612 --> 01:01:23,092
that you're dating again,
but, I mean, you can't date her.

1600
01:01:23,803 --> 01:01:26,191
God, I thought
you'd be happy about this.

1601
01:01:27,162 --> 01:01:28,688
I guess, I-I should be.

1602
01:01:28,761 --> 01:01:31,127
I'm just... You're right.

1603
01:01:31,194 --> 01:01:32,720
I'm just surprised, I mean...

1604
01:01:32,794 --> 01:01:34,767
But I'm... I'm...
I'm coming around now.

1605
01:01:36,121 --> 01:01:39,218
I mean, look how happy I am now.

1606
01:01:39,288 --> 01:01:40,215
Chloe.

1607
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:41,425
I've been meaning
to call you, actually.

1608
01:01:41,496 --> 01:01:42,641
What's been stopping you, huh?

1609
01:01:42,712 --> 01:01:44,303
Pretending to talk
to my brother's dead fiancee...

1610
01:01:44,375 --> 01:01:45,302
so you could date him?

1611
01:01:45,367 --> 01:01:46,577
Come on in.

1612
01:01:46,647 --> 01:01:48,020
No, I'm okay.

1613
01:01:48,086 --> 01:01:50,257
I just...
I want Kate's diary back.

1614
01:01:50,326 --> 01:01:52,911
Okay. Um... yeah.

1615
01:01:58,388 --> 01:02:00,591
I'm not gonna tell him
that I gave this to you...

1616
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:03,048
because, somehow,
he does seem better.

1617
01:02:03,124 --> 01:02:04,171
I know it looks bad.

1618
01:02:04,243 --> 01:02:05,322
How could you do this?

1619
01:02:05,395 --> 01:02:08,077
I mean, uh, "I can't fake it.
I'm not some scam artist."

1620
01:02:08,146 --> 01:02:09,672
I mean, you totally
took advantage of him.

1621
01:02:09,746 --> 01:02:10,673
You asked me to do this.

1622
01:02:10,739 --> 01:02:12,495
Use fake psychic vision
to date him?

1623
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:14,503
Let me think.
No, I'd remember that.

1624
01:02:15,505 --> 01:02:17,892
Chloe, I really, really care
about him.

1625
01:02:17,968 --> 01:02:19,244
Worst part is that I did this.

1626
01:02:19,313 --> 01:02:21,287
I mean, I gave this to you.

1627
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:23,334
I handed you everything
that you needed.

1628
01:02:23,409 --> 01:02:24,554
You gave what to her?

1629
01:02:24,625 --> 01:02:26,511
No, what...
It's okay. Don't...

1630
01:02:27,248 --> 01:02:28,229
What's this?

1631
01:02:31,054 --> 01:02:32,101
This is Kate's diary.

1632
01:02:32,751 --> 01:02:33,678
Yeah.

1633
01:02:33,742 --> 01:02:34,756
Why would you give this to her?

1634
01:02:35,630 --> 01:02:36,775
How'd you even get it?

1635
01:02:41,933 --> 01:02:43,361
The story about the pancreas
is in here...

1636
01:02:43,436 --> 01:02:44,996
- Um...
- and how we met.

1637
01:02:50,507 --> 01:02:51,816
Henry. Henry!

1638
01:02:51,883 --> 01:02:52,865
Henry!

1639
01:03:00,233 --> 01:03:02,175
You were right.

1640
01:03:02,249 --> 01:03:06,241
It all fell apart, you know,
'cause I'm a horrible person.

1641
01:03:06,312 --> 01:03:08,351
No, no, you're not
a horrible person.

1642
01:03:08,424 --> 01:03:11,325
Yes, I am. I am.

1643
01:03:11,399 --> 01:03:14,181
I'm a liar,
and I'm a horrible person.

1644
01:03:14,247 --> 01:03:16,634
And you know what?
I never even deserved him.

1645
01:03:16,711 --> 01:03:17,888
- Okay, you... You kn...
- I didn't!

1646
01:03:17,958 --> 01:03:19,866
No, you know what?
He's an idiot to let you go.

1647
01:03:19,942 --> 01:03:20,890
- No!
- All right? No.

1648
01:03:20,965 --> 01:03:23,234
No matter what you did,
he's an idiot to let you go...

1649
01:03:23,301 --> 01:03:24,315
okay?

1650
01:03:24,390 --> 01:03:26,048
Anyone would be lucky
to have you.

1651
01:03:26,116 --> 01:03:27,457
You're just saying that.

1652
01:03:27,525 --> 01:03:28,670
Anyone.

1653
01:03:38,946 --> 01:03:40,024
What the hell was that?

1654
01:03:40,098 --> 01:03:41,308
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1655
01:03:41,377 --> 01:03:42,653
You're my friend.

1656
01:03:42,722 --> 01:03:43,649
You're gay.

1657
01:03:43,713 --> 01:03:44,727
You're my gay friend.

1658
01:03:45,794 --> 01:03:47,451
Ah, screw it.

1659
01:03:47,521 --> 01:03:48,982
I'm not gay.

1660
01:03:50,048 --> 01:03:50,975
What?

1661
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:52,413
I'm not gay!

1662
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:54,105
I've never been gay.

1663
01:03:54,176 --> 01:03:57,338
I don't have sex with men,
and they don't have sex with me.

1664
01:03:57,407 --> 01:03:58,835
Wow.

1665
01:03:58,910 --> 01:04:01,778
So when you just kissed me
just then, you were like...

1666
01:04:01,854 --> 01:04:03,282
I'm in love with you.

1667
01:04:03,357 --> 01:04:04,371
What?!

1668
01:04:04,446 --> 01:04:05,907
I've been in love with you
since I met you.

1669
01:04:05,981 --> 01:04:08,467
Every time you turn your back
to me, I sniff your hair.

1670
01:04:08,541 --> 01:04:10,874
I went into business with you,
so I could be near you.

1671
01:04:10,940 --> 01:04:11,888
I hate cooking!

1672
01:04:11,964 --> 01:04:13,971
I wanna throw up
every time I cut a fish.

1673
01:04:14,044 --> 01:04:15,931
God, you have got to be
the worst psychic...

1674
01:04:15,996 --> 01:04:16,923
in the history of time.

1675
01:04:16,987 --> 01:04:18,447
How could you not know
any of this?

1676
01:04:18,523 --> 01:04:20,943
Why didn't you just,
like, tell me?

1677
01:04:21,018 --> 01:04:23,832
Okay, remember when we met,

1678
01:04:23,898 --> 01:04:25,654
and-and-and
we started, you know...

1679
01:04:25,721 --> 01:04:27,215
going out to lunch and dinner...

1680
01:04:27,290 --> 01:04:32,143
and talking on the phone
all day and all night.

1681
01:04:32,216 --> 01:04:33,328
I thought we were dating.

1682
01:04:34,456 --> 01:04:35,699
And... And then...

1683
01:04:35,768 --> 01:04:38,734
And then, after a week,
we went to a movie.

1684
01:04:38,807 --> 01:04:42,483
I was just about to kiss you,
and you turned to me...

1685
01:04:42,550 --> 01:04:47,536
and you said, "I love having
a gay friend to talk to.

1686
01:04:47,606 --> 01:04:48,815
"I could never be
this comfortable...

1687
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:49,964
"with a straight man."

1688
01:04:54,164 --> 01:04:56,236
What was...
What was I supposed to do?

1689
01:04:56,308 --> 01:04:58,217
You waited a week
to make your move!

1690
01:04:58,292 --> 01:04:59,753
Of course,
I thought you were gay.

1691
01:04:59,827 --> 01:05:00,754
I was taking it slow.

1692
01:05:00,820 --> 01:05:03,274
Five years, one kiss?
That's not slow.

1693
01:05:03,347 --> 01:05:04,361
That's family.

1694
01:05:04,434 --> 01:05:05,743
I'm sorry.
I missed my window.

1695
01:05:05,810 --> 01:05:08,395
I was... I was waiting for it
to come back around again.

1696
01:05:09,106 --> 01:05:10,632
God, Dan, you've, like...

1697
01:05:12,304 --> 01:05:13,416
betrayed me.

1698
01:05:13,489 --> 01:05:15,343
- Betrayed you?
- Yeah.

1699
01:05:15,409 --> 01:05:17,099
Ashley, I love you.

1700
01:05:17,168 --> 01:05:19,141
You think it was easy for me
listening to you...

1701
01:05:19,216 --> 01:05:21,038
talk about other guys, huh?

1702
01:05:21,103 --> 01:05:24,101
Watching mind-numbingly
boring romantic movies...

1703
01:05:24,174 --> 01:05:25,351
and pretending to cry?

1704
01:05:25,423 --> 01:05:27,975
Going shopping with you and
giving you advice on clothes?

1705
01:05:28,047 --> 01:05:30,151
Do you know how much
of the last five years...

1706
01:05:30,222 --> 01:05:32,044
I have spent
learning about clothes?

1707
01:05:32,109 --> 01:05:36,166
This shirt cost me $175,
and I hate it!

1708
01:05:36,237 --> 01:05:37,185
I hate it!

1709
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:38,405
I love that shirt.

1710
01:05:38,476 --> 01:05:39,903
You know, before
this whole stupid thing...

1711
01:05:39,980 --> 01:05:42,249
I probably spent
$100 a year on clothes.

1712
01:05:42,316 --> 01:05:44,420
Now? Now, I spend that much
every three weeks...

1713
01:05:44,491 --> 01:05:46,825
on this haircut,
which I also hate!

1714
01:05:49,994 --> 01:05:51,237
God.

1715
01:05:51,306 --> 01:05:53,476
We took bubble baths together.

1716
01:05:53,545 --> 01:05:54,472
Yeah.

1717
01:05:54,537 --> 01:05:56,325
Now can you see
how hard it was for me?

1718
01:05:59,049 --> 01:06:02,910
I just wanted to cry
on my gay friend.

1719
01:06:08,487 --> 01:06:09,469
Yup.

1720
01:06:20,837 --> 01:06:21,982
I'll let myself out.

1721
01:06:26,179 --> 01:06:27,193
Okay.

1722
01:06:39,905 --> 01:06:41,627
All right, I'm ready.

1723
01:06:43,361 --> 01:06:44,920
You don't have a cat.

1724
01:06:44,992 --> 01:06:47,163
I rescued a stray,
so you'd talk to me.

1725
01:06:50,207 --> 01:06:51,188
Come in.

1726
01:06:55,134 --> 01:06:56,792
So, have you thought
about a name for him yet?

1727
01:06:56,862 --> 01:06:58,007
No. After we're done here...

1728
01:06:58,078 --> 01:06:59,670
I'm taking him
back to the pound.

1729
01:07:01,085 --> 01:07:02,295
I'm kidding.

1730
01:07:02,365 --> 01:07:05,363
It's a joke,
so you start laughing now...

1731
01:07:05,436 --> 01:07:08,731
breaks the tension,
and then we start talking again.

1732
01:07:08,795 --> 01:07:10,169
Pet's a big responsibility.

1733
01:07:10,236 --> 01:07:11,478
Did you ever think
about maybe just running...

1734
01:07:11,547 --> 01:07:12,474
into me on the street?

1735
01:07:12,539 --> 01:07:14,295
Listen, I didn't know
that Ashley was gonna use...

1736
01:07:14,363 --> 01:07:16,184
the information I gave her
to start dating you.

1737
01:07:16,250 --> 01:07:17,875
I mean, I really thought
that she was just...

1738
01:07:17,946 --> 01:07:19,636
gonna tell you that Kate
wanted you to move on.

1739
01:07:23,289 --> 01:07:25,426
We... Do you
really have to do that?

1740
01:07:25,496 --> 01:07:26,706
Yeah, he needs his shots.

1741
01:07:27,448 --> 01:07:30,611
Yeah.
I think he's already had them.

1742
01:07:31,448 --> 01:07:33,007
He's my neighbor's cat.

1743
01:07:33,623 --> 01:07:35,694
Your neighbor let you borrow
her cat to bring to the vet?

1744
01:07:37,238 --> 01:07:38,220
You stole a cat?

1745
01:07:38,294 --> 01:07:39,700
I'm gonna bring him back.

1746
01:07:39,766 --> 01:07:41,588
He was on a fire escape.
It's like a walk.

1747
01:07:41,654 --> 01:07:42,863
Would you quit doin'
stupid stuff...

1748
01:07:42,934 --> 01:07:44,275
because you think you know
you're right?

1749
01:07:44,341 --> 01:07:45,965
Whoa. You should hear yourself.

1750
01:07:46,036 --> 01:07:47,083
You sound like Mom and Dad.

1751
01:07:47,156 --> 01:07:48,716
And your friends
and your bosses...

1752
01:07:48,789 --> 01:07:50,861
and your teachers and strangers
that you meet on the street.

1753
01:07:50,932 --> 01:07:53,167
They all tell you this
because it's true.

1754
01:07:53,236 --> 01:07:54,730
I'm sorry you feel that way.

1755
01:07:54,804 --> 01:07:56,657
See if you can get the cat home
without killing it.

1756
01:07:56,723 --> 01:07:57,900
I think I can handle it.

1757
01:08:04,946 --> 01:08:05,927
He's fine.

1758
01:08:15,791 --> 01:08:16,772
Hi.

1759
01:08:18,575 --> 01:08:19,949
I read this.

1760
01:08:20,015 --> 01:08:21,837
Henry, I really wanna talk
to you about all this.

1761
01:08:21,902 --> 01:08:22,829
- It's just...
- How did you know...

1762
01:08:22,895 --> 01:08:25,544
about the cake
or Hawaii or the chair?

1763
01:08:25,614 --> 01:08:26,540
None of that's in here...

1764
01:08:26,605 --> 01:08:27,848
and no one else
knows about that.

1765
01:08:28,909 --> 01:08:32,520
All right, um,
your sister gave me the diary...

1766
01:08:32,589 --> 01:08:33,994
and she asked me to pretend...

1767
01:08:34,060 --> 01:08:36,644
that Kate had talked to me,
which is not her fault...

1768
01:08:36,715 --> 01:08:38,624
because I shouldn't have done it
in the first place, okay?

1769
01:08:40,555 --> 01:08:43,337
But I did, because
I thought, I don't know...

1770
01:08:43,403 --> 01:08:45,922
I thought maybe you needed it,
you know, to help you move on.

1771
01:08:48,265 --> 01:08:50,468
But I must have crossed
over some sort of line...

1772
01:08:50,537 --> 01:08:54,147
or something, because
then, suddenly, she appeared.

1773
01:08:54,216 --> 01:08:55,361
- Kate.
- Yeah.

1774
01:08:55,432 --> 01:08:59,686
And sh... And she tried
to scare me away from you.

1775
01:09:00,455 --> 01:09:05,407
But I just... I really
wanted to be with you...

1776
01:09:05,479 --> 01:09:07,332
so I didn't let it stop me.

1777
01:09:07,398 --> 01:09:09,853
You pretended that
she wanted us to be together...

1778
01:09:09,926 --> 01:09:11,354
because you thought that
that would make me...

1779
01:09:11,429 --> 01:09:12,476
fall in love with you.

1780
01:09:15,268 --> 01:09:16,445
Yeah, I guess I did.

1781
01:09:17,220 --> 01:09:18,528
I, um...

1782
01:09:18,595 --> 01:09:23,035
I hoped that you would love me
for other reasons, too.

1783
01:09:25,923 --> 01:09:27,994
- Is she here now?
- No, I haven't...

1784
01:09:28,065 --> 01:09:31,326
I haven't actually seen her,
um, since you broke up with me.

1785
01:09:32,481 --> 01:09:35,098
Guess it was her job
to get rid of me...

1786
01:09:35,169 --> 01:09:37,143
and, well, she did that.

1787
01:09:38,656 --> 01:09:40,630
So, she just sort of disappears?

1788
01:09:40,703 --> 01:09:42,044
I don't know.

1789
01:09:46,175 --> 01:09:47,157
Thank you.

1790

1804
01:10:40,724 --> 01:10:42,546
- cats or dogs.
- # Like I know you do #

1805
01:10:42,612 --> 01:10:44,073
Come in for some coffee?

1810
01:10:51,251 --> 01:10:53,039
Cats are really good
with tools...

1811
01:10:53,106 --> 01:10:55,691
- # When all
you gotta keep is strong #
- but dogs are better spellers.

1812
01:10:55,763 --> 01:10:57,584
- # Move along, move along #
- That's a... a joke.

1813
01:10:57,649 --> 01:10:59,405
- # Like I know you do #
- Dogs, actually.

1814
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:02,694
- That's a funny trick.
- # When all you gotta keep #

1815
01:11:02,769 --> 01:11:04,361
- Is there something
wrong with cats?
- # Is strong #

1816
01:11:04,433 --> 01:11:05,861
- No, cats are great.
- # Move along, move along #

1817
01:11:05,936 --> 01:11:08,585
- Their owners are nuts.
- # Like I know you do #

1818
01:11:09,648 --> 01:11:11,337
- # When all you gotta keep #
- How many cats do you have?

1819
01:11:11,407 --> 01:11:12,454
- # Is strong #
- Four.

1820
01:11:12,527 --> 01:11:14,730
- I'll call you, okay?
- # Move along, move along #

1821
01:11:14,799 --> 01:11:17,580
- Peace.
- # Like I know you do #

1822
01:11:17,645 --> 01:11:18,627
Do you wanna go
to the restaurant?

1823
01:11:18,701 --> 01:11:19,944
- I mean,
I can take you back now.
- # And even when your hope #

1824
01:11:20,013 --> 01:11:23,241
# Is gone,
move along, move along #

1825
01:11:23,309 --> 01:11:25,610
- # Just to make it through #
- Okay.

1826
01:11:26,669 --> 01:11:29,667
# When all you gotta keep

01:11:29,740 --> 01:11:31,593

1830
01:11:38,570 --> 01:11:41,416

01:11:41,481 --> 01:11:42,855
# We move along #

01:11:42,921 --> 01:11:46,914

1833
01:11:46,986 --> 01:11:49,734
# Right back what is wrong #

1834
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:51,260
- Ashley.
- # We move along #

1835
01:11:51,335 --> 01:11:54,204
- # Go on, go on, go on, go on #
- Hi.

1836
01:11:54,279 --> 01:11:56,962
- Okay, Hi. Hello.
- Hello.

1837
01:11:57,031 --> 01:11:58,720
- Long time.
- Yeah, could've gone longer.

1838
01:11:58,790 --> 01:12:00,218
Yeah, listen, I've...

1839
01:12:00,294 --> 01:12:01,918
I've been thinking
about what I did, and...

1840
01:12:01,990 --> 01:12:03,102
Can we stop walking?

1841
01:12:03,173 --> 01:12:05,060
I'm trying to...
trying to be sincere...

1842
01:12:05,125 --> 01:12:06,685
and the panting
is really killing my delivery.

1843
01:12:06,757 --> 01:12:07,869
Sorry.

1844
01:12:08,868 --> 01:12:10,907
- I screwed up.
- Yeah, you did.

1845
01:12:10,981 --> 01:12:12,703
Yeah, I did.
Definitely screwed up.

1846
01:12:12,771 --> 01:12:14,080
But look at it this way.

1847
01:12:14,148 --> 01:12:16,187
I pretended I was gay
for five years.

1848
01:12:16,259 --> 01:12:18,527
Has any other man ever done
anything like that for you, huh?

1849
01:12:18,595 --> 01:12:19,577
I mean,
I could see a guy pretending...

1850
01:12:19,651 --> 01:12:21,886
for two, three...

1851
01:12:21,953 --> 01:12:22,935
- three, three years tops...
- Okay.

1852
01:12:23,009 --> 01:12:24,765
- But five, come on, that's...
- Okay.

1853
01:12:27,265 --> 01:12:30,198
All right, listen, Ashley,
you know me.

1854
01:12:30,273 --> 01:12:32,638
You know me better
than anyone else does.

1855
01:12:33,696 --> 01:12:35,354
And I know you.

1856
01:12:35,424 --> 01:12:37,246
Even though
I did a stupid, stupid...

1857
01:12:37,311 --> 01:12:38,238
Really stupid.

1858
01:12:38,304 --> 01:12:42,099
Beyond crazy, stupid thing
by lying to you...

1859
01:12:44,094 --> 01:12:46,395
we have been best friends
for five years.

1860
01:12:48,286 --> 01:12:49,910
Yes, that is true.

1861
01:12:51,741 --> 01:12:52,667
Look, I don't...

1862
01:12:52,732 --> 01:12:55,187
I don't know
any more fancy way to say this.

1863
01:12:56,892 --> 01:12:59,793
I'm a good guy. I love you.

1864
01:12:59,867 --> 01:13:02,233
And l... I just...

1865
01:13:02,299 --> 01:13:05,331
I just really wish
you'd give me a chance, so...

1866
01:13:09,210 --> 01:13:11,248
Do I attract
screwed-up guys, or what?

1867
01:13:28,022 --> 01:13:29,004
Hiya.

1868
01:13:30,838 --> 01:13:32,179
- You.
- Yeah.

1869
01:13:32,981 --> 01:13:34,572
Well, he doesn't look so good,
does he?

1870
01:13:35,381 --> 01:13:36,363
No, he doesn't.

1871
01:13:37,332 --> 01:13:39,055
Finish your mission?

1872
01:13:39,125 --> 01:13:40,052
Yeah. You?

1873
01:13:40,116 --> 01:13:42,798
No, or I wouldn't still be here.

1874
01:13:42,868 --> 01:13:44,295
- Really?
- Mm.

1875
01:13:44,371 --> 01:13:46,672
So you do move on
once you finish...

1876
01:13:46,738 --> 01:13:48,526
- what you're supposed to do?
- Oh, shoot.

1877
01:13:48,594 --> 01:13:50,665
Did you listen
to anything she said?

1878
01:13:51,729 --> 01:13:54,378
- No.
- So I guess
you're not done yet.

1879
01:13:54,896 --> 01:13:56,357
Guess not.

1880
01:13:56,433 --> 01:13:59,116
Look, what do you think
you're supposed to do?

1881
01:14:00,145 --> 01:14:01,092
I don't know.

1882
01:14:01,167 --> 01:14:04,014
Well, what do you want more
than anything else right now?

1883
01:14:10,639 --> 01:14:11,565
For Henry to be happy.

1884
01:14:11,630 --> 01:14:12,557
Okay.

1885
01:14:12,622 --> 01:14:14,214
What do you think
would make Henry happy?

1886
01:14:19,597 --> 01:14:20,676
I don't know.

1887
01:14:20,749 --> 01:14:22,154
Think you do.

1888
01:14:22,220 --> 01:14:24,456
Damn it! Anything but that.

1889
01:14:26,891 --> 01:14:28,265
Wait, where are you going?

1890
01:14:28,331 --> 01:14:29,792
I'm done.

1891
01:14:29,867 --> 01:14:31,077
So your job was to...

1892
01:14:31,147 --> 01:14:33,000
Get you to do
the right thing, yeah.

1893
01:14:33,066 --> 01:14:34,822
Well, why didn't you just
tell me that in the first place?

1894
01:14:34,889 --> 01:14:37,255
Would you have believed me? Mmm.

1895
01:14:38,473 --> 01:14:39,999
See ya, up there.

1896
01:14:40,073 --> 01:14:42,014
Yeah? Well, if I see you,
I know I'm not in heaven.

1897
01:14:42,088 --> 01:14:43,516
That's the spirit.

1898
01:14:52,422 --> 01:14:54,047
The yellow dress?

1899
01:14:54,118 --> 01:14:56,538
Are you planning on wearing
that, or taking it to Goodwill?

1900
01:14:56,613 --> 01:14:58,303
I haven't talked to him
in months.

1901
01:14:58,373 --> 01:15:00,642
Wow. No, "Hello, Kate.

1902
01:15:00,710 --> 01:15:02,235
"How's the afterlife
treatin' you?"

1903
01:15:02,308 --> 01:15:03,649
You know, I think I lost weight.

1904
01:15:03,716 --> 01:15:05,624
I never looked this good
when I was alive.

1905
01:15:05,699 --> 01:15:06,681
What do you want, Kate?

1906
01:15:09,475 --> 01:15:13,270
Um... all right,
this isn't easy for me, so...

1907
01:15:14,147 --> 01:15:16,055
You at a loss for words?

1908
01:15:16,129 --> 01:15:17,438
That's a first.

1909
01:15:18,721 --> 01:15:20,608
Have you talked to Henry,
you know, since...

1910
01:15:20,674 --> 01:15:21,786
Since you broke us up?

1911
01:15:21,858 --> 01:15:23,417
No, I haven't.

1912
01:15:23,489 --> 01:15:25,627
As a matter of fact,
I'm, uh, dating someone else.

1913
01:15:26,304 --> 01:15:27,318
No, you're not. You can't be.

1914
01:15:28,159 --> 01:15:29,817
Yes, I can,
and we're goin' to Vegas.

1915
01:15:29,888 --> 01:15:31,775
Well, stop! What about Henry?

1916
01:15:31,839 --> 01:15:32,885
What about him? You know what?

1917
01:15:32,958 --> 01:15:34,135
I am not interested
in whatever sick game...

1918
01:15:34,207 --> 01:15:35,319
you're playing, Kate.

1919
01:15:35,391 --> 01:15:36,699
No, listen to me.
I'm being very serious.

1920
01:15:36,766 --> 01:15:38,489
I want you two together.

1921
01:15:39,517 --> 01:15:40,662
No sale.

1922
01:15:42,590 --> 01:15:44,727
I can't believe I'm begging you
to date my husband.

1923
01:15:45,693 --> 01:15:48,441
Okay, don't you still love him?

1924
01:15:50,556 --> 01:15:52,148
Even if you weren't
screwing with me right now...

1925
01:15:52,220 --> 01:15:54,073
which it's
so clear that you are...

1926
01:15:54,139 --> 01:15:55,251
the answer would be no.

1927
01:15:56,475 --> 01:15:57,488
I moved on.

1928
01:15:59,354 --> 01:16:01,241
I mean, it killed me to do it,
but I did it.

1929
01:16:02,618 --> 01:16:03,599
So just, um...

1930
01:16:04,793 --> 01:16:06,832
Can you leave me alone now?
Please?

1931
01:16:21,526 --> 01:16:22,508
Get up!

1932
01:16:22,582 --> 01:16:23,858
Get up!

1933
01:16:23,926 --> 01:16:24,852
Henry!

1934
01:16:24,918 --> 01:16:26,444
Why can't you hear me?

1935
01:16:26,517 --> 01:16:27,857
Get up!

1936
01:16:30,452 --> 01:16:31,946
Everything okay over there?

1937
01:16:32,020 --> 01:16:33,197
Who cares about the bird?

1938
01:16:33,268 --> 01:16:35,121
Call Ashley!

1939
01:16:35,187 --> 01:16:36,648
Ashley. Call Ashley.

1940
01:16:38,003 --> 01:16:38,985
Ashley.

1941
01:16:41,106 --> 01:16:42,088
Did you just say...

1942
01:16:42,162 --> 01:16:44,201
- Ashley.
- Who taught you that?

1943
01:16:44,275 --> 01:16:45,932
Call Ashley. Call Ashley.

1944
01:16:46,001 --> 01:16:47,146
You want me to call Ashley?

1945
01:16:47,217 --> 01:16:49,158
What do you...
I'm talking to my bird.

1946
01:16:49,232 --> 01:16:50,377
Get up. Get up.

1947
01:16:50,448 --> 01:16:51,789
Kate?

1948
01:16:53,457 --> 01:16:54,439
Is that you?

1949
01:16:55,855 --> 01:16:58,603
Are you talking to me
through my bird?

1950
01:16:58,671 --> 01:16:59,718
Yes.

1951
01:17:00,719 --> 01:17:01,646
Why do you want me to...

1952
01:17:01,710 --> 01:17:02,724
Call Ashley.

1953
01:17:14,125 --> 01:17:15,433
I got a machine.

1954
01:17:15,499 --> 01:17:17,473
- Airport.
- What?

1955
01:17:17,548 --> 01:17:18,530
Airport.

1956
01:17:21,355 --> 01:17:22,282
Take the bird.

1957
01:17:22,347 --> 01:17:23,361
Oh, yeah.

1958
01:17:29,385 --> 01:17:31,588
# Think of all the luck
you got #

1959
01:17:32,617 --> 01:17:35,779
- Taxi! Taxi!
- # You know that
it's not for naught #

1960
01:17:35,848 --> 01:17:37,735
Oh, hey, nice. Thanks.

1961
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:39,076
Welcome.

1962
01:17:39,143 --> 01:17:41,248
- # It's not like that anymore #
- Where to?

1963
01:17:41,319 --> 01:17:42,628
Airport. Airport.

1964
01:17:44,167 --> 01:17:45,246
What? You heard the bird.
The airport.

1965
01:17:46,151 --> 01:17:47,677
Why are we going to the airport?
Where is she goin'?

1966
01:17:47,750 --> 01:17:48,862
Las Vegas.

1967
01:17:48,935 --> 01:17:50,395
And you want me to stop her?
I thought you hated her.

1968
01:17:50,469 --> 01:17:51,548
What gave you that idea?

1969
01:17:51,621 --> 01:17:53,279
How do you even...
How do you know this?

1970
01:17:57,573 --> 01:17:58,587
What a day, right?

1971
01:17:59,971 --> 01:18:01,214
Got your bird with you, huh?

1972
01:18:01,283 --> 01:18:02,941
It's actually my, uh, fiancee.

1973
01:18:03,011 --> 01:18:05,312
- # What is this downside #
- Ah.

1974
01:18:05,379 --> 01:18:08,247
- I think.
- # That you speak of? #

1975
01:18:09,123 --> 01:18:11,064
# What is this feeling #

1976
01:18:11,137 --> 01:18:15,130
# You're so #

1977
01:18:15,202 --> 01:18:16,826
# Sure of? #

1978
01:18:20,736 --> 01:18:23,223
# What is this downside #

1979
01:18:23,295 --> 01:18:24,309
Ashley!

1980
01:18:24,384 --> 01:18:26,009
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Back of the line, sir.

1981
01:18:26,079 --> 01:18:27,255
I just need to talk
to that woman for a second.

1982
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:28,985
The only way you get
through here is with a ticket.

1983
01:18:29,599 --> 01:18:30,907
Could you maybe get her then?

1984
01:18:31,806 --> 01:18:32,853
It's an emergency.

1985
01:18:32,926 --> 01:18:34,169
Oh, it's an emergency?

1986
01:18:34,238 --> 01:18:35,612
Well, by all means,
come on in, man.

1987
01:18:35,678 --> 01:18:36,790
You know,
people who have emergencies...

1988
01:18:36,862 --> 01:18:38,770
don't even have to go
through the metal detectors.

1989
01:18:39,645 --> 01:18:41,170
All right, there's
really no need for sarcasm.

1990
01:18:41,244 --> 01:18:42,487
Back of the line.

1991
01:18:43,004 --> 01:18:44,760
Hi. I need the cheapest
ticket you have.

1992
01:18:44,828 --> 01:18:45,776
Where do you wanna go, sir?

1993
01:18:45,852 --> 01:18:46,964
It doesn't matter.

1994
01:18:47,036 --> 01:18:49,140
Well, that's not
at all suspicious.

1995
01:18:50,075 --> 01:18:51,056
Hurry up, lard ass.

1996
01:18:52,090 --> 01:18:53,017
Excuse me?

1997
01:18:53,082 --> 01:18:54,707
Uh... no, that's, uh...

1998
01:18:54,778 --> 01:18:56,152
That's... That's my bird.

1999
01:18:56,218 --> 01:18:57,623
He says that to everybody.

2000
01:18:58,937 --> 01:19:00,365
Move those fat fingers, Helen.

2001
01:19:01,433 --> 01:19:02,807
All right, you know what?
That's enough.

2002
01:19:02,872 --> 01:19:03,854
Sorry.

2003
01:19:05,432 --> 01:19:09,108
One ticket to Miami, $1,350.

2004
01:19:09,175 --> 01:19:11,726
- That's the cheapest ticket...
- Don't be cheap. Buy it!

2005
01:19:11,798 --> 01:19:12,943
- All right, you know,
that's fine. That's fine.
- Buy it!

2006
01:19:14,615 --> 01:19:15,891
You know, I never really
thought about it...

2007
01:19:15,958 --> 01:19:18,226
but, uh, a psychic in Vegas?

2008
01:19:18,294 --> 01:19:19,919
We could really clean up,
you know?

2009
01:19:19,989 --> 01:19:21,548
Yeah.
Too bad I don't do that anymore.

2010
01:19:21,621 --> 01:19:22,548
All right.

2011
01:19:22,612 --> 01:19:23,539
Over there.

2012
01:19:23,605 --> 01:19:25,033
What?

2013
01:19:25,109 --> 01:19:26,352
What's the matter?

2014
01:19:26,421 --> 01:19:27,348
You don't wanna know.

2015
01:19:27,412 --> 01:19:28,621
Ashley.

2016
01:19:30,099 --> 01:19:31,081
What are you doing here?

2017
01:19:31,155 --> 01:19:33,226
I don't know.
The bird told me to come here.

2018
01:19:33,299 --> 01:19:34,226
Did you do this?

2019
01:19:34,290 --> 01:19:35,337
Who are you talking to?

2020
01:19:35,411 --> 01:19:37,582
Oh, let me...
Let me guess, uh, the ghost?

2021
01:19:37,651 --> 01:19:38,577
Why are you here?

2022
01:19:38,642 --> 01:19:40,584
Why is your arm around her?
You're gay.

2023
01:19:40,658 --> 01:19:42,183
No, I'm not...
I'm not gay. No, no.

2024
01:19:42,256 --> 01:19:43,532
No, I've never been gay.

2025
01:19:43,601 --> 01:19:45,029
Methinks
he doth protest too much.

2026
01:19:49,424 --> 01:19:50,406
Do you really want this?

2027
01:19:52,975 --> 01:19:54,381
Henry does.

2028
01:19:54,447 --> 01:19:55,374
Where is she?

2029
01:19:55,438 --> 01:19:56,550
She's right next to you.

2030
01:20:01,166 --> 01:20:02,757
You want Ashley and me
to be together?

2031
01:20:04,877 --> 01:20:05,924
I do.

2032
01:20:05,996 --> 01:20:08,646
I'm sorry I put you
through all of this.

2033
01:20:08,717 --> 01:20:10,985
She says she does,
and she's sorry...

2034
01:20:11,052 --> 01:20:12,676
for being such a royal bitch.

2035
01:20:13,451 --> 01:20:15,458
I mean, I'm... I'm paraphrasing.

2036
01:20:17,675 --> 01:20:18,657
Thank you, Kate.

2037
01:20:19,818 --> 01:20:20,963
You're welcome, Henry.

2038
01:20:26,889 --> 01:20:28,645
When we get to heaven,
all bets are off.

2039
01:20:30,793 --> 01:20:32,069
She says you're welcome.

2040
01:20:32,680 --> 01:20:34,915
So, Kate
wants us to be together.

2041
01:20:36,007 --> 01:20:37,413
I want us to be together.

2042
01:20:40,135 --> 01:20:41,117
What do you want?

2043
01:20:43,429 --> 01:20:45,436
Well, I wouldn't
wanna piss her off again.

2044
01:20:46,246 --> 01:20:48,798
# And love #

2045
01:20:48,870 --> 01:20:52,218
# Such a silly game
we play #

2046
01:20:52,292 --> 01:20:55,160
# Oh, like a summer's day
in May #

2047
01:20:55,236 --> 01:20:57,243
# What is love? What is love? #

2048
01:20:57,316 --> 01:21:00,664
- Hello?
- # I just want you
to be loved #

2049
01:21:00,739 --> 01:21:02,167
# Oh-oh-oh #

2050
01:21:02,243 --> 01:21:04,347
You know what? That probably
wasn't gonna work out anyway.

2051
01:21:04,418 --> 01:21:05,530
- I'm Bill, by the...
- I'm not gay!

2052
01:21:05,602 --> 01:21:06,529
- Okay.
- Okay.

2053
01:21:06,594 --> 01:21:07,521
- All right.
- Very good.

2054
01:21:07,585 --> 01:21:09,275
Me, neither. Not gay at all.

2055
01:21:09,345 --> 01:21:11,318
Um, maybe, though,
when we get to Vegas...

2056
01:21:11,393 --> 01:21:12,320
we can grab some dinner...

2057
01:21:12,384 --> 01:21:15,066
and talk about how,
you know, not gay we are.

2058
01:21:15,904 --> 01:21:17,332
# Ah, ah, ah #

2059
01:21:17,408 --> 01:21:19,677
# Love #

2060
01:21:19,744 --> 01:21:22,776
# Who could tell me
I am wrong? #

2061
01:21:24,127 --> 01:21:26,035
# I just think
that I am strong #

2062
01:21:26,110 --> 01:21:28,281
# What is love? What is love? #

2063
01:21:28,350 --> 01:21:31,480
# I just want you to be loved #

2064
01:21:31,549 --> 01:21:32,923
# Oh-oh oh-oh #

2065
01:21:32,989 --> 01:21:34,036
# Oh-oh #

2066
01:21:39,068 --> 01:21:41,969
I am so glad I met you.
You're hilarious.

2067
01:21:42,043 --> 01:21:43,766
I was just going
for ironically amusing.

2068
01:21:43,835 --> 01:21:45,110
Are you sure you haven't
been drinking already?

2069
01:21:45,178 --> 01:21:46,738
Oh, wait
till after the ceremony.

2070
01:21:46,810 --> 01:21:47,737
If you like me now...

2071
01:21:47,802 --> 01:21:49,558
you are gonna love me
when I'm drunk.

2072
01:22:00,665 --> 01:22:02,606
Wow. That was, um...

2073
01:22:03,447 --> 01:22:05,268
- really quick.
- Well, I'm not gay.

2074
01:22:05,334 --> 01:22:06,894
I'm not gay.

2075
01:22:06,966 --> 01:22:07,893
I just need...
I just wanna get that...

2076
01:22:07,958 --> 01:22:09,648
out there right now, so there's
no misunderstanding later.

2077
01:22:09,718 --> 01:22:12,684
I'm not...
So that's why we, uh... Okay.

2078
01:22:13,781 --> 01:22:14,860
There she is.

2079
01:22:24,340 --> 01:22:25,322
Oh, God, hold on, Dad.

2080
01:22:25,875 --> 01:22:27,467
One second. One second.

2081
01:22:31,602 --> 01:22:32,583
Hi.

2082
01:22:35,281 --> 01:22:36,970
Look, I know
this was supposed to be you...

2083
01:22:38,129 --> 01:22:39,208
so thank you.

2084
01:22:41,553 --> 01:22:43,112
Just make him happy, okay?

2085
01:22:45,168 --> 01:22:46,214
Or else, you know.

2086
01:22:48,495 --> 01:22:51,113
Wait, can you come back
and haunt me for that, or...

2087
01:22:51,183 --> 01:22:52,165
I... I don't know.

2088
01:22:52,239 --> 01:22:54,026
I kind of missed
the orientation speech.

2089
01:22:59,181 --> 01:23:00,522
Don't worry.

2090
01:23:01,741 --> 01:23:03,365
Kate, I will make him happy.

2091
01:23:08,075 --> 01:23:09,449
I love Gardenias.

2092
01:23:20,553 --> 01:23:21,535
Sorry.

2093
01:23:43,877 --> 01:23:46,079
We are gathered here
in the presence of God...

2094
01:23:46,148 --> 01:23:48,448
to witness the exchanging
of vows that will bind...

2095
01:23:48,516 --> 01:23:50,403
- # I can see clearly now #
- this couple together...

2096
01:23:50,468 --> 01:23:52,988
- # The rain is gone #
- in the covenant
and relationship of marriage.

2097
01:23:53,060 --> 01:23:55,644
When the ceremony has ended,
they will leave this place...

2098
01:23:55,714 --> 01:23:58,079
- # I can see all obstacles #
- as husband and wife...

2099
01:23:58,146 --> 01:24:00,088
- # In my way #
- for the very first time.

2100
01:24:02,850 --> 01:24:08,064
# Gone are the dark clouds
that had me blind #

2101
01:24:08,127 --> 01:24:10,036
# It's gonna be a bright #

2102
01:24:11,007 --> 01:24:13,723
# Bright, sunshiny day #

2103
01:24:15,231 --> 01:24:17,053
# Yeah #

2104
01:24:17,118 --> 01:24:18,775
# Look all around #

2105
01:24:18,846 --> 01:24:22,774
# There's nothin'
but blue skies #

2106
01:24:24,158 --> 01:24:25,618
# Look straight ahead #

2107
01:24:25,693 --> 01:24:30,961
# There's nothin'
but blue skies #

2108
01:24:31,036 --> 01:24:33,141
# I can see clearly now #

2109
01:24:33,212 --> 01:24:35,414
# The rain is gone #

2110
01:24:38,235 --> 01:24:42,424
# I can see all obstacles
in my way #

2111
01:24:45,370 --> 01:24:50,386
# Gone are the dark clouds
that had me blind #

2112
01:24:50,456 --> 01:24:52,398
- # It's gonna be a bright #
- Hello, Kate.

2113
01:24:52,473 --> 01:24:53,749
- # Bright #
- # Bright #

2114
01:24:53,816 --> 01:24:55,474
Not you again! Come on!

2115
01:24:55,545 --> 01:24:57,518
Relax! I'm just here
to congratulate you.

2116
01:24:57,591 --> 01:24:58,670
Really?

2117
01:24:58,743 --> 01:25:00,018
I did the right thing?

2118
01:25:00,086 --> 01:25:01,612
You certainly did.

2119
01:25:01,686 --> 01:25:03,278
Now just give me back
the orb of true light...

2120
01:25:03,350 --> 01:25:04,724
that you collected
from your loved ones...

2121
01:25:04,791 --> 01:25:06,251
and you can move on.

2122
01:25:06,870 --> 01:25:07,797
I'm sorry,
the orb of which what?

2123
01:25:07,861 --> 01:25:08,973
Oh, dear.

2124
01:25:09,046 --> 01:25:10,059
Are you screwing with me?

2125
01:25:10,132 --> 01:25:11,790
Are you allowed
to screw with me?

2126
01:25:11,861 --> 01:25:12,788
Hey, hey, no!

2127
01:25:12,852 --> 01:25:14,542
You are not disappearing
on another conversation!

2128
01:25:14,612 --> 01:25:16,433
You better hope I don't end up
in this room again!

2129
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:17,961
I'm gonna kick your ass!

2130
01:25:18,036 --> 01:25:19,213
Get back here!

2131
01:25:25,480 --> 01:25:35,315
THE END
