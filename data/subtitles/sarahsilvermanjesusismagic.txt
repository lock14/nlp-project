1
00:00:01,697 --> 00:00:04,179
I said 'Shut up, you stupid twat' And...

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:05,372
- Oh my God.
- I know.

3
00:00:05,373 --> 00:00:08,614
Because... And then I'm like:
'Oh fuck, what did I just do?'

4
00:00:08,615 --> 00:00:11,847
But then the audience loved it.
They went nuts.

5
00:00:11,848 --> 00:00:17,552
And she looked like an idiot, like they're all like,
she is a stupid twat that should shut up.

6
00:00:17,553 --> 00:00:20,619
- That's awesome.
- So it was like felt really good. So that's on the record.

7
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:26,088
It's all like... So many more copies.
Called someone a stupid twat on it.

8
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,676
Who knows. I just glut out
the record finally.

9
00:00:29,677 --> 00:00:31,495
It's so good, so good.

10
00:00:31,496 --> 00:00:34,088
Perhaps I'm a bit producing it. It's crazy.

11
00:00:34,089 --> 00:00:35,089
Wow!

12
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:40,362
And then this book. The stupid idea
I had about how guys are jerks.

13
00:00:40,363 --> 00:00:42,175
I went on Oprah with it.

14
00:00:42,176 --> 00:00:45,745
Oh my God, why didn't you tell me?
I would have loved to see that.

15
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:48,825
I didn't know how would it go,
I wanted it away. You know.

16
00:00:49,643 --> 00:00:52,104
- Can I come on to?
- Yeah, for sure.

17
00:00:52,105 --> 00:00:54,128
Oh my God, that's so cool.

18
00:00:54,129 --> 00:00:56,861
What's going on with you?
What about that pilot?

19
00:00:56,862 --> 00:00:59,137
- I got it.
- Awesome.

20
00:00:59,139 --> 00:01:03,914
I know. I'm waiting to hear for it's gonna get picked up.
And that looks really good. They really like it.

21
00:01:03,915 --> 00:01:04,915
Awesome!

22
00:01:04,916 --> 00:01:05,916
It's so great!

23
00:01:05,917 --> 00:01:07,640
And Dacky was in it.

24
00:01:07,641 --> 00:01:13,339
Cause I brought him to the table reading they needed
a dog for one scene and then like "He's perfect"

25
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,134
He is perfect.

26
00:01:15,953 --> 00:01:19,392
And then I sold that script
to this Comedy Central.

27
00:01:19,393 --> 00:01:21,650
- A sports thing.
- Sport show of all things.

28
00:01:21,651 --> 00:01:23,833
I know. I don't even know
anything about sports.

29
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:24,834
Who loves.

30
00:01:26,615 --> 00:01:28,613
It's concept, I guess.

31
00:01:28,614 --> 00:01:31,296
What about a...
What about you?

32
00:01:31,297 --> 00:01:33,787
What's been going on?
I haven't seen you in a while.

33
00:01:36,383 --> 00:01:38,113
So much.

34
00:01:38,114 --> 00:01:40,933
- Wow, really?
- Yeah.

35
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:44,737
I'm doing a lot. So...

36
00:01:44,738 --> 00:01:46,442
You've been getting out a lot.

37
00:01:46,443 --> 00:01:50,577
I actually wrote a show.

38
00:01:50,578 --> 00:01:51,537
Wow, cool.

39
00:01:51,538 --> 00:01:53,841
Are you shopping it around or...?

40
00:01:54,235 --> 00:01:58,471
No it's doing it.
I mean it's...

41
00:02:00,422 --> 00:02:06,048
- I mean it's gonna be on. It's a show.
- On TV?

42
00:02:06,049 --> 00:02:14,556
No, but it's actually
like a play slash movie.

43
00:02:14,557 --> 00:02:16,878
- It's cool. Like in a theatre.
- Wow.

44
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:18,688
Yeah.

45
00:02:18,689 --> 00:02:25,204
It sounds amazing. What is it? What's it about?
Are you like the star of it? What is it?

46
00:02:25,205 --> 00:02:27,921
It's about a ...

47
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:33,106
the Holocaust.

48
00:02:33,107 --> 00:02:38,539
Yeah. And it's kind of a...

49
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,925
But it's funny.

50
00:02:42,502 --> 00:02:46,438
And it's also musical.

51
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:49,514
- Oh my God, that sounds awesome.
- I know.

52
00:02:49,515 --> 00:02:51,021
When are you doing it?

53
00:02:51,022 --> 00:02:53,150
It's a real opus, you know.

54
00:02:53,151 --> 00:03:02,043
You know what, tonight. And it's
actually tonight so I'd better skid detail.

55
00:03:02,044 --> 00:03:06,918
- Right now?
- Yeah. I've got a bunch of stuff to do pre-pro.

56
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:10,435
Can we come see it?
I wanna see it.

57
00:03:12,834 --> 00:03:19,557
Shit. It sold out. It's totally sold out,
every scene. I know, it sucks.

58
00:03:19,558 --> 00:03:23,713
What if we just hang backstage and
like watch from the wings or something?

59
00:03:23,714 --> 00:03:28,187
Yeah. Can we just be backstage?

60
00:03:28,663 --> 00:03:32,578
We can stand by the
curtains and be quiet.

61
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:35,128
I can't think why not.

62
00:03:38,545 --> 00:03:41,755
- So will you let us know...?
- Yeah, sure, definitely.

63
00:03:41,756 --> 00:03:44,623
I'm excited. I'm totally excited.

64
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:46,963
So see you guys tonight.

65
00:03:46,964 --> 00:03:48,909
- Good luck.
- See you at the show.

66
00:03:56,623 --> 00:03:58,000
Fuck!

67
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:08,695
"Here I go again with my big mouth."

68
00:04:08,696 --> 00:04:12,292
"Spelling off like I got some going."

69
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:15,476
"I wrote a show and it's playing tonight?"

70
00:04:15,477 --> 00:04:19,070
"I'm so foolish shit man. What was I thinking?"

71
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:25,902
"I gotta write a show but how am I gonna
do a show. And I don't even have a show to write."

72
00:04:25,903 --> 00:04:32,904
"I never wrote a show, but if I ever wrote a show,
I bet that all of them would know and thinking bites."

73
00:04:32,905 --> 00:04:35,701
"You know what. Fuck down."

74
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,864
"I could write a show."

75
00:04:38,865 --> 00:04:43,561
"I could write a show. I'll just do it."

76
00:04:44,475 --> 00:04:46,616
"I'll write a show."

77
00:04:46,617 --> 00:04:49,654
"All it takes is elbow grease"

78
00:04:49,655 --> 00:04:51,753
"And I could write a show."

79
00:04:51,754 --> 00:04:54,888
"I'll write a show tonight."

80
00:04:54,889 --> 00:04:58,415
"I hope I do it right."

81
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:05,683
"I could take this mixed up
world and put it in a show."

82
00:05:05,684 --> 00:05:09,380
"I'll write a show alright."

83
00:05:09,381 --> 00:05:11,948
"And I'll have it by tonight."

84
00:05:14,186 --> 00:05:20,418
"All I need is a theatre space
and a bag of weed and a star."

85
00:05:20,419 --> 00:05:21,948
"A star!"

86
00:05:21,949 --> 00:05:23,039
"Great!"

87
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:28,810
"Good job, Sarah. I'm writing a whole show for tonight.
I don't even have a star. Who's gonna be my star?"

88
00:05:28,811 --> 00:05:32,203
"She's gotta be pretty and
she's gotta be smart."

89
00:05:32,204 --> 00:05:35,084
"She's gotta be funny and
she's gotta be hot."

90
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:38,878
"She's gotta have a perfect
smile just like me."

91
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:42,201
"I just need a star
but who could it be?"

92
00:05:42,202 --> 00:05:43,385
"Julia Roberts?"

93
00:05:43,386 --> 00:05:45,204
"Nah."

94
00:05:45,205 --> 00:05:46,750
"Nicole Kidman?"

95
00:05:46,751 --> 00:05:48,775
"Are you kidding, man?"

96
00:05:48,776 --> 00:05:50,235
"Sandra Bullock?"

97
00:05:51,131 --> 00:05:52,263
"Sandra Bullock."

98
00:05:55,434 --> 00:05:59,359
"She's gotta be the kind of
girl that blows your mind,"

99
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,895
"She ought to be better than
those three twats combined."

100
00:06:02,898 --> 00:06:09,638
"She's gotta have a thing
that you just can't define."

101
00:06:12,864 --> 00:06:14,829
Me.

102
00:06:16,269 --> 00:06:17,758
It's me.

103
00:06:21,396 --> 00:06:23,546
You are beautiful.

104
00:06:33,401 --> 00:06:34,837
No.

105
00:06:35,535 --> 00:06:37,134
Not like this.

106
00:06:40,698 --> 00:06:41,988
Alright.

107
00:06:41,989 --> 00:06:43,779
I'll do it.

108
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:50,627
"I got what it takes. Got what it needs.
Got what a show needs."

109
00:06:50,628 --> 00:06:57,502
"I, I'll show them more, little of me.
I'm what the world needs."

110
00:07:00,613 --> 00:07:03,902
"Hear the train coming
it's coming for me."

111
00:07:03,903 --> 00:07:06,019
"I'm going to Star Town."

112
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:09,100
"Hear the train coming it's coming for me."

113
00:07:09,101 --> 00:07:12,036
"I'm gonna be a star now."

114
00:07:12,037 --> 00:07:14,469
I'm a comedian, that's what I do.

115
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:16,819
How do we become whatever
it is that we become?

116
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:20,351
How is he a lawyer,
how is she a hooker?

117
00:07:20,352 --> 00:07:23,297
How are we whatever
it is we become?

118
00:07:23,298 --> 00:07:29,000
I think what it is, it's like
as we grow up from child.

119
00:07:29,001 --> 00:07:35,861
You know. In our childhood we have all these disfunctions and
they kind of... they melt together and they form a formula.

120
00:07:35,862 --> 00:07:39,884
An individual formula,
it drives us to be whatever it is.

121
00:07:39,885 --> 00:07:46,131
We're driven to be, you know. For comedians
it's definitely like any kind of humiliation, you know.

122
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,467
I know for me.

123
00:07:47,468 --> 00:08:01,210
I was a bad wetter willing to my teens.  And continue
to have a bevy of, you know, unwanted hairs. And I...

124
00:08:03,728 --> 00:08:13,849
I was raped by a doctor, which is
a so bitter-sweet for a Jewish girl.

125
00:08:17,631 --> 00:08:19,144
Thank you.

126
00:08:21,307 --> 00:08:24,225
I knew something good
would come out of that.

127
00:08:24,226 --> 00:08:26,607
Out of rape.

128
00:08:28,652 --> 00:08:29,741
I am...

129
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:36,793
I wear this saint Christopher medal sometimes because
I'm Jewish but my boyfriend is Catholic and it was just....

130
00:08:36,794 --> 00:08:42,724
It was cute the way he gave it to me, you know.
He said if it doesn't burn through my skin it will protect me.

131
00:08:45,729 --> 00:08:49,307
Who cares. Different religions,
you know. I mean...

132
00:08:49,308 --> 00:08:52,809
I guess if you in time with an issue, I suppose
would be like if you're having a baby...

133
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:56,058
You got to figure out like how
you wanna raise your baby.

134
00:08:56,172 --> 00:09:03,411
...or whatever, you know. Which wouldn't even still
not be an issue for us because we'd be honest, you know...

135
00:09:03,412 --> 00:09:11,151
... and just say, you know like Mammy
is one of the chosen people and ...

136
00:09:11,152 --> 00:09:15,670
... and daddy believes
that Jesus is magic.

137
00:09:18,867 --> 00:09:20,836
That's not nice.

138
00:09:22,406 --> 00:09:28,949
You know Jesus is magic you know
because he turn water to wine and he...

139
00:09:30,429 --> 00:09:33,259
I think he made the
Stature of Liberty disappear.

140
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,980
... or something.

141
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:39,921
You know that Jews got all,
you know they don't want.

142
00:09:39,922 --> 00:09:44,323
But then Jesus movie came out, you know,
and but now the Jews didn't want people to see it.

143
00:09:44,324 --> 00:09:46,272
Because they felt...

144
00:09:46,273 --> 00:09:52,247
Everybody blames the Jews for killing Christ
and then the Jews try to pass it off on the Romans.

145
00:09:52,248 --> 00:09:56,356
I'm one of the few people that
believes it was the blacks.

146
00:10:00,172 --> 00:10:07,179
I don't care. Good. I hope the Jews did kill Christ.
I'd do it again, I'd fucking do it again on the second.

147
00:10:07,812 --> 00:10:10,280
By here is breaking stocks clacking.

148
00:10:10,281 --> 00:10:11,668
This way.

149
00:10:19,935 --> 00:10:24,636
My boyfriend and I were on like second or
third stage, you know, we're like...

150
00:10:24,637 --> 00:10:26,903
...we're finally comfortable.
You know around.

151
00:10:26,904 --> 00:10:32,558
Like I'm finally comfortable enough to pee in front
of my boyfriend, which is so great, you know.

152
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:34,814
Cause now I'm gonna try
it in the bathroom.

153
00:10:34,815 --> 00:10:37,047
And...

154
00:10:37,048 --> 00:10:43,167
...we take showers together
and you know it's really...

155
00:10:43,168 --> 00:10:52,783
I guarantee if you take a shower with your boyfriend, by the time
you step out of that shower your breasts will be sparkling clean.

156
00:10:52,784 --> 00:10:54,583
Sparkle in.

157
00:10:58,826 --> 00:11:04,339
I was licking jelly out of my boyfriend's
penis and all of a sudden...

158
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:07,975
...all of a sudden I'm thinking "Oh my God,
 I'm turning into my mother."

159
00:11:07,976 --> 00:11:09,632
You know it's like...

160
00:11:11,484 --> 00:11:13,492
Those clues. You know.

161
00:11:13,493 --> 00:11:16,306
Of becoming our parents. It's scary.

162
00:11:17,643 --> 00:11:20,411
So scary.

163
00:11:20,412 --> 00:11:23,525
Try to get that lilts like that.

164
00:11:23,526 --> 00:11:26,280
It's a fun. What if fun cut.

165
00:11:26,281 --> 00:11:29,129
So scary.

166
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:32,373
Can I steal you for a minute?
Like that kind of voice.

167
00:11:32,374 --> 00:11:33,493
I'm so into that.

168
00:11:33,494 --> 00:11:35,515
I don't know why it's fun.

169
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:43,720
Can I steal you for a minute?

170
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:48,800
I'm on a birth control pill.
Cause I do a lot of fucking.

171
00:11:51,614 --> 00:11:56,058
But I want like I wanna try something else,
because it's really hormonian and...

172
00:11:56,059 --> 00:11:59,783
I'm always looking... I'm always asking my
friends what they use for birth control.

173
00:11:59,784 --> 00:12:05,795
...take a little poll, like I ask my friend
Charlie what he and his wife use for birth controlling.

174
00:12:05,796 --> 00:12:09,870
He said he just cums
all over her face.

175
00:12:15,984 --> 00:12:17,654
I'm gonna try that.

176
00:12:19,199 --> 00:12:27,914
He has kids already. My boyfriend, he has kids. I mean they’re like...
He's got a boy and a girl, they’re nine and eleven.  And they’re great.

177
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:34,645
You know what, he actually made them those
ages to commemorate 911, which I hate.

178
00:12:36,347 --> 00:12:38,809
You know it has a lot more than a pin.

179
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:45,935
I always think like I should get on it
if I wanna have kids. I just...

180
00:12:45,936 --> 00:12:53,227
You know, once you had thirty you know you've got to decide fast
Cause it can be difficult to conceive, it can be dangerous.

181
00:12:53,228 --> 00:12:55,907
And the best time to have a baby
is when you're black teenager.

182
00:13:09,573 --> 00:13:14,397
I'm not like a hoydie-toydie kind of girl.

183
00:13:14,398 --> 00:13:16,947
I don’t wanna jewels. I'm not like...

184
00:13:16,948 --> 00:13:20,075
I don't really... I'm not into jewelry or anything.

185
00:13:20,076 --> 00:13:21,076
I'm such a hypocrite.

186
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:25,396
There's a jewel that I think is ...
I guess I'm in such a jap.

187
00:13:25,397 --> 00:13:33,802
There is one jewel that I think is stunning. That I...
It's just like a classic. By jap I mean Japanese.

188
00:13:33,803 --> 00:13:39,511
But it's a... It's just gorgeous. You know.
And it's really... It’s rare.

189
00:13:39,512 --> 00:13:45,694
You know it's only found like on the tip of
the tailbone of Ethiopian babies.

190
00:13:48,355 --> 00:13:50,605
They debone the babies.

191
00:13:50,606 --> 00:13:54,140
I know that sounds so bad
when you say it out aloud.

192
00:13:54,141 --> 00:13:58,526
But no, if you saw it...

193
00:13:59,956 --> 00:14:02,447
So worth it.

194
00:14:02,448 --> 00:14:05,213
You know it's like...
How do I even describe it like a...

195
00:14:05,214 --> 00:14:10,640
...like if a diamond had
that newborn baby smell.

196
00:14:13,622 --> 00:14:26,608
I have a moral issue with it obviously cause they're
treating the unions that debone the babies really bad.

197
00:14:27,732 --> 00:14:30,852
Pick your battles I guess. It's so cute.

198
00:14:34,645 --> 00:14:39,088
I can't wait till Sunday I'm gonna see my
favorite niece and my other niece.

199
00:14:40,888 --> 00:14:49,014
I shouldn't have favorites, I know I shouldn't but I just
can't help that she is crazy about me and I just love that in people.

200
00:14:49,015 --> 00:14:56,983
And I can make her laugh so easily. I've always been able
to make her laugh. Like literally since she was a baby.

201
00:14:56,984 --> 00:14:59,415
I could make her laugh, which is so great.

202
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:01,534
And you know what babies love.

203
00:15:01,535 --> 00:15:04,072
Ethnic jokes.

204
00:15:08,434 --> 00:15:12,165
She came out of the closet
recently, my niece.

205
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:15,031
Announced to the family that she is a lesbian.

206
00:15:15,032 --> 00:15:17,748
She is seven. Did I mention that?

207
00:15:17,749 --> 00:15:23,192
And I don't even know she knows what a
lesbian is. But I support her completely.

208
00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:25,967
I'll tell you it's heartbreaking.

209
00:15:28,015 --> 00:15:31,093
My sister punished her for it.

210
00:15:31,094 --> 00:15:33,971
Can you believe that?

211
00:15:33,972 --> 00:15:36,387
No pussy for a week.

212
00:15:36,388 --> 00:15:47,249
Which to us may not sound likable, but when you're seven.
You know, week is a long time. You know. It's like...

213
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:55,091
She goes to a school where the kids are not
allowed to play tag on the playground.

214
00:15:56,423 --> 00:16:03,858
And the reason that they give is that they say, you know,
if a kid loses a tag it could give him low self-esteem.

215
00:16:05,606 --> 00:16:09,014
First of all it's fucking retarded. Okay.

216
00:16:09,015 --> 00:16:12,062
And, I'm sorry. I know I shouldn't say that.

217
00:16:12,063 --> 00:16:15,474
And by retarded I mean,
they can do anything.

218
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:29,365
I think self-esteem is born out of things like,
you know, I don't know preserving pasts...

219
00:16:29,366 --> 00:16:37,472
...losing, you know, or getting through disappointment. Like that.
Maybe we should be giving these kids a reason to win.

220
00:16:37,473 --> 00:16:39,906
We should be giving them motivation....

221
00:16:39,907 --> 00:16:42,259
...you know, to win.

222
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:47,139
I tell my niece every time she
loses a tag an angel get AIDS.

223
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,835
For instance.

224
00:16:51,516 --> 00:16:53,958
You have to speak her language.
You know what I mean.

225
00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:59,480
I tell her, you know, that a beautiful angel...

226
00:16:59,605 --> 00:17:02,108
...gets full blown-ins.

227
00:17:05,313 --> 00:17:07,802
And you know what, she wins.

228
00:17:07,803 --> 00:17:10,260
So think about that.

229
00:17:10,261 --> 00:17:14,005
I tell her that when God gives you AIDS...

230
00:17:14,006 --> 00:17:17,327
When God does give you
AIDS by the way? I don't know.

231
00:17:19,274 --> 00:17:21,790
Make lemonades.

232
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:28,461
It's called, it's positive spin. You know.

233
00:17:28,462 --> 00:17:29,612
I mean it's...

234
00:17:29,613 --> 00:17:32,537
That's what we should steal
from corporate America, you know.

235
00:17:32,538 --> 00:17:37,433
That's what we should steal, one positive
thing we should take from the man, you know.

236
00:17:37,434 --> 00:17:46,142
Is positive spin. The whole idea of taking something terrible,
something tragic and spin it up into something good.

237
00:17:46,143 --> 00:17:53,730
And if American Airlines were smart their slogan would be:
"American Airlines - first through the towers."

238
00:17:59,084 --> 00:18:04,236
Because it is something in which
they came firsts. Right?

239
00:18:04,237 --> 00:18:05,106
Right.

240
00:18:06,973 --> 00:18:13,059
Obviously I'm not trying to be literal
of the events of the September 11.

241
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:17,921
They were devastating. And
they were beyond devastating.

242
00:18:17,922 --> 00:18:22,924
You know, I don’t wanna say especially for
these people or especially for these people.

243
00:18:22,925 --> 00:18:24,707
But especially for me.

244
00:18:26,379 --> 00:18:36,841
Because it happened to be the same exact day that
found out that the soy cholate is like 900 calories.

245
00:18:39,157 --> 00:18:42,066
I had been drinking them everyday.

246
00:18:43,528 --> 00:18:48,477
Cause you hear soy.
You know you think healthy.

247
00:18:48,478 --> 00:18:49,941
And it's a lie.

248
00:18:54,281 --> 00:18:58,154
But it was also the day we were attacked.

249
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:04,122
Devastating.

250
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:12,966
Remember the rage, you know. And then
there is no place to put it. Where do you put it?

251
00:19:12,967 --> 00:19:16,214
I'll tell you what I did
- domain names.

252
00:19:18,987 --> 00:19:25,192
I bought OsamaBinLaden.com,
OsamaBinLaden.net, OsamaBinLaden.org.

253
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,639
And who's he gotta come to, big ass.

254
00:19:32,313 --> 00:19:34,915
Guess what, it's not for sale.

255
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:45,530
Looks like you're gonna have to be Osama 1.

256
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:51,541
And then who is laughing last - America.

257
00:19:51,542 --> 00:19:54,264
America is.

258
00:19:56,129 --> 00:20:02,007
Was a tough year for me, I actually... it was the
same year I suit my manager for sexual harassment.

259
00:20:02,008 --> 00:20:06,773
which, I don't know if you know anything
about show business, but something that...

260
00:20:06,774 --> 00:20:11,727
...boy, you know for a struggling actress to
suit her manager out here in Hollywood

261
00:20:11,728 --> 00:20:17,037
It's something that ...
It takes a lot of guts to do. You know.

262
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:20,451
Especially because he didn't do anything.

263
00:20:23,802 --> 00:20:27,711
We were in Scotland for a tress camp.

264
00:20:27,712 --> 00:20:29,419
The whole agency went.

265
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:32,354
Oh Jesus!

266
00:20:32,355 --> 00:20:35,071
- That's horrible. What happened?
- What the fuck is this, Karl?

267
00:20:35,072 --> 00:20:35,841
You got fire.

268
00:20:35,842 --> 00:20:37,532
What?

269
00:20:37,533 --> 00:20:38,555
What!?

270
00:20:38,556 --> 00:20:40,447
Wochie water.

271
00:20:40,448 --> 00:20:44,145
I'm fucking jam this up somebody's ass.

272
00:20:44,146 --> 00:20:47,385
I mean come on Sarah.
You asked for it.

273
00:20:47,386 --> 00:20:50,457
I asked you for use your jam up your own ass, Karl.

274
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:52,203
Would you ask me for it?

275
00:20:52,204 --> 00:20:55,818
Fidgy water! I only drink Fidgy water

276
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:59,440
Did you ask for Fidgy water?

277
00:21:00,566 --> 00:21:02,116
Cause I'll...

278
00:21:02,117 --> 00:21:05,828
Okay, now I'm mad.

279
00:21:05,829 --> 00:21:08,198
Now you got me mad.

280
00:21:08,199 --> 00:21:11,211
I don't drink this water.
It tastes thick.

281
00:21:11,212 --> 00:21:14,833
Listen to me. I would break down
walls for you okay?

282
00:21:14,834 --> 00:21:22,888
I will go into my guy's office and I will personally,
you know, masturbate him into a cup for you.

283
00:21:22,889 --> 00:21:24,575
Is that what you want?

284
00:21:24,576 --> 00:21:26,409
What do you want me to do?

285
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:30,192
You wanna me go liposuction Herbie Weinstein...

286
00:21:30,193 --> 00:21:32,051
...and give you some of his fat?

287
00:21:32,052 --> 00:21:35,554
What is it you dream of?
I wanna be a part of a Sarah's dream.

288
00:21:36,919 --> 00:21:41,137
I want you to take your dreams and
I want you to use me as a tool.

289
00:21:41,138 --> 00:21:46,364
And I want you to carve your
dreams out of wood, real wood.

290
00:21:46,532 --> 00:21:47,713
Oak.

291
00:21:49,704 --> 00:21:51,559
And then I want you to...

292
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,080
...deepen in what you lack.

293
00:21:55,115 --> 00:21:57,091
So they never change.

294
00:21:57,092 --> 00:21:59,058
Never change.

295
00:22:04,022 --> 00:22:06,524
What did the agency
send you for the show?

296
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:08,163
I told them to send you a gift.

297
00:22:08,164 --> 00:22:09,803
Cheese in sausage platter.

298
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:11,446
Cheese in sausage?

299
00:22:12,867 --> 00:22:14,286
I wanna take this.

300
00:22:14,287 --> 00:22:17,499
I have an early morning meeting.

301
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:25,687
Best part of a strawberry.
Best part.

302
00:22:28,836 --> 00:22:30,412
Are you ready to do the show?

303
00:22:30,413 --> 00:22:35,447
No I'm not ready to do the show, because
I can't even lubricate my fuck damn throat.

304
00:22:37,455 --> 00:22:38,756
- You know what.
- I'm gonna call...

305
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:44,193
I'm gonna call Gogie Water and
I'm gonna get mad at myself.

306
00:22:44,194 --> 00:22:46,679
I'll get my phone number.
I wish I had my cell.

307
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:49,069
No, you know what, Karl. Forget it.

308
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:51,921
Right. You just have my
fucking understudy do it.

309
00:22:56,699 --> 00:22:59,051
You're up for a show?

310
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,286
Get out there and knock them dead, alright?

311
00:23:14,081 --> 00:23:19,750
This is so gay. I just promised myself that I'm...

312
00:23:19,751 --> 00:23:24,869
..totally should stop the show for a second...
But I just promised myself that I would...

313
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:27,734
...dedicate this performance to my nana.

314
00:23:27,735 --> 00:23:34,760
Who although this mean I'll be your cup of tea specifically.
But she was very supportive of me.

315
00:23:34,761 --> 00:23:37,739
And we were very close.

316
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:40,484
And she passed away a year ago.

317
00:23:41,569 --> 00:23:43,279
This is for you nana.

318
00:23:47,781 --> 00:23:49,809
I'm sorry.

319
00:23:58,696 --> 00:24:04,280
She was ninety-six so obviously
I suspect fowl play.

320
00:24:08,689 --> 00:24:15,187
I am spending my own money and
I'm getting her body exhumed.

321
00:24:17,101 --> 00:24:22,378
And I am going to get a
full rape exam performed.

322
00:24:25,451 --> 00:24:28,819
And I'm gonna get to the bottom of this.

323
00:24:33,127 --> 00:24:36,551
And my parents are not behind me.

324
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:41,162
What else is new?

325
00:24:44,094 --> 00:24:45,508
They never are.

326
00:24:45,509 --> 00:24:48,541
They don't believe in me.

327
00:24:49,805 --> 00:24:52,000
So they're wrong this time.

328
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:54,986
That sucks for them.

329
00:25:06,745 --> 00:25:11,521
Oh God please let them find semen in
my dead grandmother's vagina.

330
00:25:21,056 --> 00:25:28,794
My shit and I'm sorry
and that belongs offstage.

331
00:25:34,413 --> 00:25:38,120
"Can you blow your old nose,
can you tie your own shoe?"

332
00:25:38,121 --> 00:25:42,171
"If you had go grey once would
you even know what to do?"

333
00:25:42,172 --> 00:25:46,082
"When you make the duty is it in your pants?"

334
00:25:46,083 --> 00:25:49,546
"Or trousers as they suddenly damp?"

335
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:53,304
"Are you mad because your grandson is gay?"

336
00:25:53,305 --> 00:25:57,363
"Is it a bummer that your pubes are all grey?"

337
00:25:57,364 --> 00:26:01,398
"When you clear your throat
is it really disgusting?"

338
00:26:01,399 --> 00:26:05,207
"Does it go on for hours and miles?"

339
00:26:05,208 --> 00:26:09,353
"You're gonna die soon,
you're gonna die soon."

340
00:26:09,354 --> 00:26:12,914
"It's not cold in here you're just dying."

341
00:26:12,915 --> 00:26:17,090
"You're gonna die soon,
you're gonna die soon."

342
00:26:17,091 --> 00:26:21,015
"You in the back, you are dying soon."

343
00:26:21,016 --> 00:26:24,653
"You're gonna die soon,
you're gonna die soon."

344
00:26:24,654 --> 00:26:28,742
"We're all gonna die but
not as soon as you, guys."

345
00:26:28,743 --> 00:26:35,942
"You're gonna die, you're gonna die.
You're dying."

346
00:26:39,384 --> 00:26:40,842
"Do you think I'm lazy?"

347
00:26:40,843 --> 00:26:42,955
"That's hilarious."

348
00:26:42,956 --> 00:26:46,036
"You're seen around,
dye your hair and take drugs."

349
00:26:46,037 --> 00:26:49,027
"The more you shrink,
the bigger your mouth gets."

350
00:26:49,028 --> 00:26:52,441
"It drives me crazy how you chew your vomits."

351
00:26:52,442 --> 00:26:54,207
"You told me you hated my perve."

352
00:26:54,208 --> 00:26:55,760
"I've been within you."

353
00:26:55,761 --> 00:27:00,229
"Pick up your prescription.
I'm not your candyman. Bagabooms."

354
00:27:01,524 --> 00:27:06,462
"You're gonna die soon,
you're gonna die. You're dying."

355
00:27:08,057 --> 00:27:16,110
I'm just sensitive and my skin is peeper thin.

356
00:27:16,111 --> 00:27:20,263
And people don't realize that
cause I'm sassy and I'm brassy.

357
00:27:20,903 --> 00:27:24,075
But I am... I just...

358
00:27:25,367 --> 00:27:32,529
You know I see care commercials with these
little kids with the giant bellies and the flies.

359
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:37,211
And these are one and two
year-old babies, you know.

360
00:27:37,212 --> 00:27:38,737
Nine months pregnant.

361
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:46,231
It breaks my heart in two.

362
00:27:49,069 --> 00:27:51,941
It breaks my heart in half.

363
00:27:52,281 --> 00:27:56,040
And I don't give money cause I don't
want them to spend it on drugs.

364
00:28:01,201 --> 00:28:02,535
I give.

365
00:28:02,536 --> 00:28:06,603
You know I give.

366
00:28:06,604 --> 00:28:17,071
You know, I mean I dispass summer sent
15 really fun sweaters to this village in Africa.

367
00:28:17,072 --> 00:28:20,192
In really fun colors.

368
00:28:20,193 --> 00:28:22,939
Expecting nothing by the way.

369
00:28:25,906 --> 00:28:32,154
They called their money together,
whatever they call it.

370
00:28:32,155 --> 00:28:39,307
And bought a stamp and sent
me a postcard, thanking me.

371
00:28:39,308 --> 00:28:41,561
And it's a, you know, "Thank you".

372
00:28:42,317 --> 00:28:47,797
That day we had enough sweaters for
every single member of the village to get one.

373
00:28:47,798 --> 00:28:50,854
And that they were delicious.

374
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:15,974
I am working on an open
letter and it goes like this

375
00:29:15,975 --> 00:29:23,548
'Guess what, Martin Luther King.
I had a fucking dream too.

376
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:37,071
I had a dream that I was in my living-room. It wasn't my
living room, but it was like play in my living room in the dream.

377
00:29:37,907 --> 00:29:44,869
And I walk through to the backyard and
there's a pool and as I'm diving in there's a shark...

378
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:50,875
...coming up from the water with braces.'

379
00:29:50,876 --> 00:29:54,251
So maybe you're no so fucking special.

380
00:29:59,287 --> 00:30:01,595
Martin Looser King.

381
00:30:03,699 --> 00:30:04,626
Yeah.

382
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:10,738
I wanna be the first comic ever
to shit on Martin Luther King.

383
00:30:11,732 --> 00:30:14,084
People only talk about the good things.

384
00:30:15,156 --> 00:30:18,774
They don't mention he was a litterbug.

385
00:30:22,137 --> 00:30:23,941
He would lock...

386
00:30:23,942 --> 00:30:29,610
He'd roll up all the windows and lock
them and fart in the car with the heat up.

387
00:30:31,438 --> 00:30:38,271
Well his family suffered
and he would laugh.

388
00:30:41,087 --> 00:30:43,442
I just think people
should know everything.

389
00:30:44,518 --> 00:30:46,691
Before they give someone a day.

390
00:30:51,861 --> 00:30:53,544
I'm a comic I've something to say.

391
00:30:54,372 --> 00:30:56,129
That's the difference.

392
00:30:59,373 --> 00:31:02,257
Learnmedy, that's what I call it.

393
00:31:09,449 --> 00:31:10,949
When I was  a...

394
00:31:11,642 --> 00:31:15,750
When I was little I saw my father's
penis by accident and I just...

395
00:31:15,751 --> 00:31:19,683
I wasn't scarred by now but I think it really
affected me just because I was so young.

396
00:31:19,684 --> 00:31:20,888
You know. And so drunk.

397
00:31:23,609 --> 00:31:25,115
I did...

398
00:31:25,116 --> 00:31:26,125
This is fucked up.

399
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:32,460
When I was in high school I went out with my
father's best friend and that's embarrassing, you know.

400
00:31:32,461 --> 00:31:37,176
My father having a fourteen
year old best friend.

401
00:31:42,216 --> 00:31:47,978
It's like the way you treat your kids. You know the
way you raise them it forms everything they become.

402
00:31:47,979 --> 00:31:51,231
All the hang-ups or
whatever they had.

403
00:31:51,232 --> 00:31:56,469
I went to get some water, I went to liquor
store down the street to get some water.

404
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:59,860
Some delicious Fidgy water actually.

405
00:31:59,861 --> 00:32:02,381
Which for some reason just tastes better.

406
00:32:04,901 --> 00:32:09,434
And as I'm walking in. There's a
man standing outside of the door.

407
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:16,322
Leutering outside the door. And as
I walk by he goes 'I want pussy'.

408
00:32:19,323 --> 00:32:25,513
First of all I'm not considered or
anything I just... But he, you know...

409
00:32:26,648 --> 00:32:28,886
He was talking to me.

410
00:32:32,175 --> 00:32:35,608
He definitely was talking to me
and he was like 'I want pussy'.

411
00:32:35,609 --> 00:32:38,670
I think it was more like 'I want pussy'.

412
00:32:38,671 --> 00:32:41,154
I can't do these accents.

413
00:32:43,821 --> 00:32:51,892
The point is I had every reason to be offended, to be
angry, you know, or whatever, but I felt sorry for him.

414
00:32:53,258 --> 00:32:57,212
It made me sad, because
he was so obvious to me.

415
00:32:57,213 --> 00:33:06,681
That this is the person who grew up, who was a child you know,
whose mother and father probably never gave him any pussy.

416
00:33:09,733 --> 00:33:15,579
You got to think before you judge people.
There's the point. Because it's a cycle.

417
00:33:18,126 --> 00:33:20,980
I have a joke to that part but. Anyway.

418
00:33:20,981 --> 00:33:24,264
The point I'm trying to say is
that kids need role models.

419
00:33:24,265 --> 00:33:32,106
They need adults in their lives that they can mold their own lives after.
Otherwise they gonna grow up and they're gonna be fucked up.

420
00:33:32,107 --> 00:33:34,205
Look at strippers.

421
00:33:34,206 --> 00:33:40,696
Right? Strippers should be
role models for little girls.

422
00:33:41,748 --> 00:33:45,571
If only for the fact that
they wax their assholes.

423
00:33:47,908 --> 00:33:49,923
I don't have the guts.

424
00:33:49,924 --> 00:33:53,105
And I don't think a lot of you do either.

425
00:33:53,106 --> 00:33:55,307
You excluded, sir.

426
00:33:58,853 --> 00:34:02,017
They deserve the purple heart
for that, the purple asshole.

427
00:34:03,399 --> 00:34:12,599
I have never... I mean the closest I've ever come to
waxing my asshole is once I got it washed and styled.

428
00:34:16,814 --> 00:34:22,699
They say, you know, strippers,
they end up being in porn.

429
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:26,460
It's like a gateway job to porn.

430
00:34:28,186 --> 00:34:29,439
I don't know.
What you gonna do?

431
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:34,282
I'd never do it.  And I could if
I wanted to up in approached.

432
00:34:36,385 --> 00:34:40,416
Or if I did it would be purely,
you know, for political reasons...

433
00:34:40,542 --> 00:34:47,098
...because I do not think there are enough
Jewish women represented in porn.

434
00:34:47,099 --> 00:34:49,092
Fuck my tokus!

435
00:34:53,057 --> 00:34:54,807
I'm a bad Jew.

436
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:58,160
I'm a dirty Jew.

437
00:34:59,209 --> 00:35:02,553
Fucking dirty Jew.
Fuck my fucking tokus.

438
00:35:05,798 --> 00:35:07,361
We have fun.

439
00:35:08,842 --> 00:35:11,431
Can I steal you?

440
00:35:14,459 --> 00:35:18,473
People think Jewish women aren't sexy.
That's such a bullshit, you know.

441
00:35:18,474 --> 00:35:20,680
Put on a sexy neglige.

442
00:35:33,645 --> 00:35:39,803
I have a long neck, that's probably one of my best
features. Out of many good features. But it's...

443
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:44,186
I've a very swan-like neck.

444
00:35:44,187 --> 00:35:48,746
And my neck is actually six inches long,
completely flaccid.

445
00:35:50,921 --> 00:35:55,012
I am cheating. I'm measuring
from the base of my balls.

446
00:36:02,186 --> 00:36:16,001
I was watching a porn and it was like series of vignettes and this one
scene featured Ron Jeremy, very famous pornographic lesbian.

447
00:36:16,002 --> 00:36:20,755
And he, in the scene he's
masturbating on to a lady.

448
00:36:23,193 --> 00:36:26,987
But I noticed that his pinky was out.

449
00:36:26,988 --> 00:36:38,663
And found out why he does that. I found out why he
masturbates with his pinky out. It's because he's classy.

450
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:45,291
I'd like to sing a song.

451
00:36:46,228 --> 00:36:48,440
If I may. With your permission.

452
00:36:48,441 --> 00:36:55,051
This is a song dedicated to all the porn
actors and porn actresses out there..

453
00:36:55,052 --> 00:37:00,468
I know that my guitar is Steve.
Did porn for a wile, gay porn.

454
00:37:02,609 --> 00:37:08,610
Ladies it was work, it was a job.
Trust me, but...

455
00:37:08,611 --> 00:37:10,210
I was in gafro.

456
00:37:11,943 --> 00:37:13,720
You got gafroed all over your face.

457
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:17,900
But seriously, let's take it down a second.

458
00:37:17,901 --> 00:37:21,038
Jennifer, can we take it down,
get some mood light in here?

459
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:23,380
Wow, sexy. Sexy lighting.

460
00:37:24,037 --> 00:37:28,197
This is a song... Is there anything on me at all?

461
00:37:30,763 --> 00:37:40,379
"You give yourself to all lovers."

462
00:37:42,864 --> 00:37:49,789
"Sharing all your liquidness."

463
00:37:50,584 --> 00:37:58,227
"Temporary happiness."

464
00:37:58,228 --> 00:38:01,595
"It's you."

465
00:38:05,226 --> 00:38:08,848
"There's a hole in your butt.
Where the duty comes out."

466
00:38:08,849 --> 00:38:12,658
"There's a hole in your butt
where the penis goes in."

467
00:38:12,659 --> 00:38:19,416
"Your vagina had so many penises in, that you might
as well talk about the times they were not in it."

468
00:38:19,417 --> 00:38:24,634
"Just roll on the times
that are more unique."

469
00:38:26,479 --> 00:38:32,359
"Do you ever take drugs so that
you can have sex without crying?"

470
00:38:33,662 --> 00:38:39,317
"Do you ever take drugs so that
you can have sex without crying?"

471
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:48,054
"There's a dream in your head that will never come true.
There's a sticking this all over and it didn't come from you."

472
00:38:48,055 --> 00:38:55,129
"You wish your dad had been there but more often times he was not.
You can't put your arms around the dirty gang-bang cumshot."

473
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:56,833
"But that's all you get."

474
00:38:57,357 --> 00:38:59,419
"That's all you get."

475
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:07,217
"Do you ever take drugs so that
you can have sex without crying?"

476
00:39:08,575 --> 00:39:14,364
"Do you ever take drugs so that
you can have sex without crying?"

477
00:39:16,091 --> 00:39:25,765
"There's a hole in your heart where the sorrow poures out.
There's a hole in your heart where ambivalence sets in."

478
00:39:28,887 --> 00:39:34,941
"All the penises in the country."

479
00:39:37,071 --> 00:39:44,826
"All the penises in the world."

480
00:39:47,056 --> 00:39:54,200
"All the penises in the galaxy."

481
00:39:58,409 --> 00:40:06,392
"Want your hard hole"

482
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:26,046
Thank you.

483
00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:29,376
Thank you for this Silverman.

484
00:40:38,986 --> 00:40:44,142
You know who has a tiny vagina?

485
00:40:45,343 --> 00:40:47,304
Barbie.

486
00:40:49,603 --> 00:40:51,170
Not Klaus Barbie.

487
00:40:51,171 --> 00:40:53,593
The anthem is Nazi.

488
00:40:53,594 --> 00:40:54,802
Okay.

489
00:40:55,487 --> 00:40:58,257
Nazis are assholoes.
And I'll be the first one to say it.

490
00:40:58,258 --> 00:40:59,551
Some edgy.

491
00:41:02,635 --> 00:41:07,919
Nazis are motherfucking
asshole wipes, dicks.

492
00:41:10,367 --> 00:41:13,536
They cute when they’re little. I will get that.

493
00:41:13,537 --> 00:41:16,463
You're so cute. Why can they be so small?

494
00:41:21,712 --> 00:41:24,760
I always know when its Hitler's birthday.

495
00:41:24,761 --> 00:41:29,171
Cause they announced it on Entertainment Tonight.

496
00:41:29,172 --> 00:41:32,188
Right before they got a commercial,
you see like a silhouette.

497
00:41:32,189 --> 00:41:38,678
And then they say, you know,"This man is
responsible for the deaths of six million Jews."

498
00:41:38,679 --> 00:41:41,758
Is it Ted Danson?

499
00:41:45,684 --> 00:41:47,901
Patrick Doughy?

500
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:57,370
My niece is... my lesbian niece, they all families for
a Julian. She goes to hebrew school and loves it.

501
00:41:57,371 --> 00:42:04,405
And she called me up and she's like, you know
"Aunt Sarah, did you know that Hitler killed sixty million Jews?"

502
00:42:04,406 --> 00:42:12,513
And I corrected her and said you know,
I think he is responsible for killing six million Jews.

503
00:42:12,514 --> 00:42:18,415
And she said "Oh yes, six million, I knew that
but seriously, I mean what's the difference?"

504
00:42:21,517 --> 00:42:27,207
The difference is sixty million
is unforgivable, young lady.

505
00:42:29,137 --> 00:42:31,132
Kids, you know.

506
00:42:31,133 --> 00:42:34,188
Try to figure them out.
I can't. Who could?

507
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:45,422
My nana was a survivor of the Holocaust.
I'm sorry, alleged Holocaust.

508
00:42:45,423 --> 00:42:53,358
And he had the tattoo, you know, the number and thank
God she was at one of the better concentration camps.

509
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:57,717
She had a vanity number,
it's said a... "Bedazzled."

510
00:42:57,718 --> 00:42:59,497
Just kind of fun.

511
00:43:00,649 --> 00:43:05,002
You know I don't understand the...

512
00:43:05,003 --> 00:43:09,098
... Jewish people who
drive German cars.

513
00:43:09,099 --> 00:43:11,090
It's so...

514
00:43:11,091 --> 00:43:18,022
It's not a secret. that companies like Mercedes and
BMW and you know, Hitler commissioned Volkswagen.

515
00:43:18,023 --> 00:43:21,833
These are companies that
built cars for the Nazi war affair.

516
00:43:22,478 --> 00:43:29,527
Jewish people who drive German cars it's so gay.

517
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:31,680
It's just gay.

518
00:43:31,681 --> 00:43:36,841
And on the other side of the thing there's companies,
you know, there's Mercedes, companies like that who...

519
00:43:36,842 --> 00:43:42,526
Boy, you know, if they could have only had the foresight,
if they only could have seen into the future.

520
00:43:43,028 --> 00:43:49,122
The kind of business, you know, the amount of
money they'd be making from Jewish consumers.

521
00:43:50,163 --> 00:43:55,222
I don't know, maybe they'd help not
killed the Jews. But, you know...

522
00:43:55,223 --> 00:44:05,628
Instead they helped, facilitated genocide of a people
who would ultimately become their best customers.

523
00:44:08,046 --> 00:44:12,270
Any Jew will tell you it's just
bad business, you know.

524
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:19,103
And now I feel preachy. But I just ...
I really believe this to be true.

525
00:44:19,104 --> 00:44:30,956
I believe that if black people were in Germany during World War 2,
that the Holocaust would have never happened. I do, you know.

526
00:44:30,957 --> 00:44:34,071
Or not to Jews.

527
00:44:39,001 --> 00:44:44,296
I got in trouble for saying the word 'chink' on
a talk show. On the network talk show.

528
00:44:44,297 --> 00:44:49,207
It was in the context of a joke, you know.
Obviously that would be weird.

529
00:44:49,208 --> 00:44:51,156
I'd be like a really bad career choice.

530
00:44:52,572 --> 00:45:00,480
But nevertheless the president of an Asian-American watched
our group out here in Los Angeles. His name is Guy Ayoki.

531
00:45:00,481 --> 00:45:06,343
And he was up in arms about it. And he put
my name in all the papers, calling me a racist.

532
00:45:06,344 --> 00:45:13,606
And it hurts. I mean as a Jew, as a
member of the Jewish community...

533
00:45:13,607 --> 00:45:18,553
...I was really concerned that
we're loosing control of the media.

534
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:32,576
I'm right. I mean like what kind of world do we live in, where
a totally cute white girl can't say chink on network television?

535
00:45:35,389 --> 00:45:37,423
It's like the 50's.

536
00:45:37,424 --> 00:45:38,569
It's scary.

537
00:45:40,301 --> 00:45:45,979
There are only two Asian people that I
know that I have any problem with, at all.

538
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:55,894
One is Guy Ayoki, the other is my friend
Steve who actually went pee-pee in my coke.

539
00:45:57,017 --> 00:46:01,054
He's all 'Me Chinese, me play joke'

540
00:46:04,142 --> 00:46:08,614
If you have to explain it,
Steve, it's not funny.

541
00:46:10,690 --> 00:46:12,417
It's not funny.

542
00:46:12,418 --> 00:46:14,504
We have to break it down.

543
00:46:18,598 --> 00:46:22,136
You have to be able
to laugh at yourself. So...

544
00:46:22,137 --> 00:46:24,891
It's what I tell Asian people all the time.

545
00:46:26,214 --> 00:46:28,017
They don't listen.

546
00:46:30,710 --> 00:46:39,009
Midgets. You know the politically correct
word for 'midget' is 'little person'.

547
00:46:39,010 --> 00:46:47,613
Which just tickles me because it's like the only politically correct
word that actually more insulting than the original one.

548
00:46:47,614 --> 00:46:52,150
Midgets don't like being called 'little people'.

549
00:46:52,151 --> 00:46:56,369
They much prefer 'Yes you are!'

550
00:47:06,038 --> 00:47:09,127
Thank you for laughing at that.
I appreciate it.

551
00:47:09,128 --> 00:47:14,271
I always feel crappy when I do that joke.
It gets such a good laugh.

552
00:47:15,372 --> 00:47:22,410
I just feel like. What did midgets ever do?
You know as a people to deserve to be marked.

553
00:47:22,412 --> 00:47:27,092
They’re human beings born extra crazy small.

554
00:47:31,761 --> 00:47:36,065
I don't think like anybody here thinks
we should make fun of midgets.

555
00:47:37,496 --> 00:47:39,501
But we do anyway.

556
00:47:40,462 --> 00:47:45,016
I think it's because...

557
00:47:45,229 --> 00:47:47,483
I'll tell you why we make fun of midgets.

558
00:47:47,484 --> 00:47:49,197
We're not afraid of them.

559
00:47:49,198 --> 00:47:52,736
That's what it always boils down to,
cross the board.

560
00:47:53,859 --> 00:47:59,794
I mean, I had a joke with the word
'nigger' in it, that I thought was so edgy.

561
00:47:59,795 --> 00:48:01,314
And so hip.

562
00:48:01,315 --> 00:48:05,889
I was doing it all over town at comedy
clubs and I was at one this one club...

563
00:48:05,890 --> 00:48:13,071
...doing my show and I look in a front
row and a whole front table is black people.

564
00:48:13,072 --> 00:48:17,198
Or African American people.

565
00:48:17,199 --> 00:48:20,619
And you know what?
He was half and half.

566
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:21,928
I'm pretty sure.

567
00:48:24,801 --> 00:48:30,007
But the point is I didn't do the joke.

568
00:48:30,008 --> 00:48:35,418
And you get ask yourself, is that an
edgy joke or is that the racist joke?

569
00:48:35,419 --> 00:48:38,531
I didn't do it cause I was afraid of them.

570
00:48:41,353 --> 00:48:42,501
I didn't.

571
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:47,150
And I ended up changing that joke to chinks.

572
00:48:50,003 --> 00:48:53,661
So you live and you learn
and hopefully you grow.

573
00:48:56,746 --> 00:49:05,245
I was going... I was about to go on a talk show and talk about that whole
kind of idea how we make fun of people that we're not afraid of.

574
00:49:05,246 --> 00:49:10,039
But we refrain from making fun
of people we... that scare us.

575
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:14,482
And I was about  to go on and a segment
producer came over to me and he said.

576
00:49:14,483 --> 00:49:18,312
You know, instead of
niggers say the N word.

577
00:49:18,313 --> 00:49:23,207
And I said, great, what do you want me to
say for chink? And he said 'Say chink.'

578
00:49:23,208 --> 00:49:24,995
Why?

579
00:49:27,272 --> 00:49:30,518
I'd like to sing a song for you now.

580
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:45,405
It's twisted.

581
00:49:52,652 --> 00:49:54,152
A love song.

582
00:49:54,854 --> 00:49:57,774
Oh shit.

583
00:50:01,270 --> 00:50:06,237
I did that on rehearsal too, I forgot and the guy,
one of the guys working in a back said 'Plug it in'.

584
00:50:06,238 --> 00:50:09,739
And I said "Yeah, we will fucking rip it up".

585
00:50:10,607 --> 00:50:12,432
Plug it in.

586
00:50:16,075 --> 00:50:17,958
One, two, three, four.

587
00:50:17,959 --> 00:50:21,198
"I love you more than bears love honey."

588
00:50:21,199 --> 00:50:24,572
"I love you more than Jews love money."

589
00:50:24,573 --> 00:50:29,356
"I love you more than Asians are good at math."

590
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:34,496
"I love you even if it's not hip."

591
00:50:34,497 --> 00:50:37,652
"I love you more than black people don't tip."

592
00:50:37,653 --> 00:50:42,195
"I love you more than Puerto Ricans need baths."

593
00:50:44,436 --> 00:50:47,592
"I love you more than girls love dolls."

594
00:50:47,593 --> 00:50:50,743
"I love you more than dogs love balls."

595
00:50:50,744 --> 00:50:55,034
"I love you more than the white stuff in us it."

596
00:50:57,217 --> 00:51:00,537
"I love you like Gary Busey."

597
00:51:00,538 --> 00:51:03,919
"I love you more than Dikes love pussy."

598
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:08,360
"I love you more than my
after show monster bone heap."

599
00:51:19,555 --> 00:51:26,997
"Jewish people driving German cars."

600
00:51:26,998 --> 00:51:30,911
"Jewie people buying German cars."

601
00:51:30,912 --> 00:51:33,346
"What the cock is that shit?"

602
00:51:33,988 --> 00:51:37,683
"But maybe it's like take back for night."

603
00:51:37,684 --> 00:51:41,230
"Maybe it's like a bleeding hearts
grow old and swing to the right."

604
00:51:41,231 --> 00:51:45,834
"Maybe it's like when a faggot
calls himself a faggot."

605
00:51:45,835 --> 00:51:51,059
"Jewish people driving German cars."

606
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:54,074
"It's the opposite of foo-boo."

607
00:51:54,505 --> 00:52:02,034
"But maybe it's Patty Herst siding with her kidnappers, maybe it's
like African miner killing diamond-bering gangster robbers."

608
00:52:02,035 --> 00:52:07,696
"Maybe it's like when blackeyes
calls each other niggers."

609
00:52:50,539 --> 00:52:51,988
"Cha-cha-cha."

610
00:53:03,784 --> 00:53:13,201
My friend Ryan Lynch came for me tonight. We got drunk and...
he got drunk I don't drink, but I think I... something happened.

611
00:53:16,767 --> 00:53:23,762
I dared him to deep his balls into
his drink for a dollar, for a second.

612
00:53:23,763 --> 00:53:27,229
And would not do it.

613
00:53:27,230 --> 00:53:32,327
I just thought it'd be funny if he like,
I don't know, play... like pleate them in.

614
00:53:35,013 --> 00:53:40,483
He wouldn't do it. I just think it's interesting,
like I know exactly why he wouldn't do it.

615
00:53:40,706 --> 00:53:49,589
And this is interesting. He wouldn't do it because
he knew if he put them in his drink and they floated...

616
00:53:49,918 --> 00:53:53,441
...we would know that his balls are bewitched.

617
00:53:53,476 --> 00:53:57,566
And I just... love that, you know.

618
00:53:58,786 --> 00:54:02,454
I love like getting into the psychology of people.

619
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:10,558
I did not lose my virginity until was 26.

620
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:12,559
And that's true.

621
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:14,700
19 vaginally.

622
00:54:18,296 --> 00:54:22,602
But 26, you know, what my
boyfriend calls the 'real way'.

623
00:54:28,097 --> 00:54:31,879
You know what, that's a fucking
disgusting joke. And I don't do that.

624
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:33,515
That's a fictional.

625
00:54:33,516 --> 00:54:37,884
That's a joke, I mean I don't...
That's fucking nasty. And I don't...

626
00:54:37,885 --> 00:54:42,390
My asshole is...
It's totally for decoration.

627
00:54:42,391 --> 00:54:44,720
It's like an appendix.

628
00:54:44,721 --> 00:54:47,038
I tell people that I was shocked.

629
00:54:48,263 --> 00:54:49,566
I am...

630
00:54:51,754 --> 00:55:00,606
And my friend Mike was... he was like on last night
'Oh, you know, it's not disgusting, it's natural.'

631
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:03,563
It's like trying to sell me on it being natural.

632
00:55:04,297 --> 00:55:08,032
First of all duty comes out of there, okay.

633
00:55:08,033 --> 00:55:11,627
And second of all fucking
duty comes out of here.

634
00:55:11,628 --> 00:55:16,516
I don't need two reasons
when duties involved.

635
00:55:16,517 --> 00:55:22,552
I'm like going off and then remember
as I'm talking that Mike is gay.

636
00:55:22,553 --> 00:55:30,367
And I now have to backpedal and say like 'no,
your asshole is like your vagina. That's totally cool'.

637
00:55:33,225 --> 00:55:35,273
I think on my figs, I'm a comedian.

638
00:55:38,074 --> 00:55:45,105
And he took me to the gay march this year and it was blast,
I haven't been there before. And it's so fun and it's just crazy.

639
00:55:45,993 --> 00:55:52,445
I just don't want... like I don't wanna
be labeled as straight or labbled as gay.

640
00:55:52,446 --> 00:55:58,986
I just want people to look at me and see me.
You know that's white.

641
00:56:01,593 --> 00:56:05,547
I can say that, by the way, cause I used
to go out with a guy who was half black.

642
00:56:05,548 --> 00:56:08,932
Who totally broke up with me.
Cause I'm a fucking loser.

643
00:56:13,172 --> 00:56:15,603
I just heard myself say that.

644
00:56:15,604 --> 00:56:16,984
I'm such a pessimist.

645
00:56:16,985 --> 00:56:24,109
It was a worst attitude. He's a half-white.
And he totally broke up with me.

646
00:56:24,110 --> 00:56:34,422
And it's funny now, like what is it? King size 20-20 or whatever.
Like I know it so obvious to me now why he broke up with me.

647
00:56:34,423 --> 00:56:37,395
Cause he has so fucking low self esteem.

648
00:56:37,396 --> 00:56:44,956
And I can't compete with that, like everybody knows somebody
who... it's like anything you say to them they gonna take it.

649
00:56:44,957 --> 00:56:47,636
They gonna hear it in the most negative way.

650
00:56:47,637 --> 00:56:48,766
You know what I mean.

651
00:56:48,767 --> 00:56:50,281
And he was like. You could give him...

652
00:56:50,282 --> 00:56:58,377
Like I gave him a compliment, alright. I told him he probably
would have made like a really expensive slave.

653
00:57:01,696 --> 00:57:04,023
Like in the olden time days.

654
00:57:04,024 --> 00:57:05,708
Not now.

655
00:57:07,279 --> 00:57:18,082
What does he do? Right. It goes through the roobe gold
berg, you know craziest straw of his low self esteem.

656
00:57:18,083 --> 00:57:22,439
And it hit his ear and he
heard something. Fucked up.

657
00:57:26,072 --> 00:57:30,026
I can't control that.
Like I can't control what he hears.

658
00:57:30,929 --> 00:57:33,841
He has to learn how to love himself.

659
00:57:33,842 --> 00:57:37,963
Before I can stop hating his people.

660
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:40,635
As a people.

661
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:47,328
I don't care if you think I'm racist.
I just want you to think I'm thin.

662
00:57:57,708 --> 00:58:00,148
I do talk a little bit about race.

663
00:58:00,149 --> 00:58:11,119
The important thing it’s like the...
Like if I based my material on stereotypes.

664
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:19,654
That would be messed up. It would.
But I don't. Okay. I base it on facts.

665
00:58:21,671 --> 00:58:29,020
Fact the SAT test, the test that basically
decides whether you go to college or not.

666
00:58:29,021 --> 00:58:38,288
Is called truly byest towards Caucasians.
That's a fact. Okay, I heard that somewhere.

667
00:58:38,289 --> 00:58:39,711
Fact...

668
00:58:39,712 --> 00:58:48,443
It the year 2004 women still get paid 70 cents
to every dollar a men gets paid. And that's a fact.

669
00:58:49,588 --> 00:58:59,742
Okay. Fact, every 30 seconds in this country a person of color jumps
up and down and waves their arms behind a local news reporter.

670
00:59:08,112 --> 00:59:09,305
Fact.

671
00:59:14,876 --> 00:59:21,451
I went out with the Mexican man. Do racist people
go out with Mexican men? I don't think so.

672
00:59:24,229 --> 00:59:26,442
No, they're filthy.

673
00:59:32,647 --> 00:59:41,757
It's so hard like...  I feel about like it's jokes. You know like
this woman came up to me last night a she was Mexican and...

674
00:59:41,758 --> 00:59:51,596
...she was so irate, you know she was so angry. And ahe came
up to me ad she said 'You know I'm Mexican and I don't stink'

675
00:59:52,029 --> 01:00:00,121
And it's just broke my heart. Like I had to
explain to her like you can't smell yourself.

676
01:00:00,122 --> 01:00:02,185
Thanks a lot.

677
01:00:29,068 --> 01:00:35,069
Thank you so much. And we would
love to, and I mean the royal We,

678
01:00:35,070 --> 01:00:42,066
leave you with a song.
Something inspirational to live with.

679
01:00:42,067 --> 01:00:43,423
Amazing grace.

680
01:00:47,689 --> 01:00:55,253
"Amazing grace how sweet it sounds.
That save the rash like me."

681
01:00:55,254 --> 01:01:03,493
"I once was lost but now I'm found.
Was blind but now I see."

682
01:01:03,494 --> 01:01:11,217
"It was grace that taught my heart to fear.
And grace my fears relieved."

683
01:01:11,218 --> 01:01:19,132
"A precious day that grace appeared
the hour I first believed."

684
01:01:19,133 --> 01:01:27,221
"Amazing grace, how sweet it sounds,
that save the rash like me."

685
01:01:27,222 --> 01:01:33,884
"I once was lost but now
I'm found, was blind by now I..."

686
01:01:33,885 --> 01:01:35,812
"Was blind by now I'm..."

687
01:01:35,813 --> 01:01:43,311
"Blind by now I see."

688
01:01:52,255 --> 01:02:06,575
"I say no good people turn their hips each
day so satisfied I'm on my way."

689
01:02:06,576 --> 01:02:07,617
Good night!

690
01:02:43,828 --> 01:02:45,239
Come in.

691
01:02:46,121 --> 01:02:47,352
Hi.

692
01:02:47,353 --> 01:02:50,623
- Oh my God, you were so great.
- Thank you.

693
01:02:50,624 --> 01:02:51,941
It was awesome.

694
01:02:51,942 --> 01:02:53,516
It was amazing.

695
01:02:53,517 --> 01:02:56,055
It's like all new material.

696
01:02:56,056 --> 01:03:00,229
And rape, and AIDS and
Holocaust, just like you said.

697
01:03:00,230 --> 01:03:02,427
I was so cool.

698
01:03:02,428 --> 01:03:04,387
You must be so proud of yourself.

699
01:03:04,388 --> 01:03:05,729
- It is so great.
- I am.

700
01:03:05,730 --> 01:03:08,628
Wow, look at this, it's so pretty.

701
01:03:08,629 --> 01:03:10,037
It's beautiful.

702
01:03:10,038 --> 01:03:11,421
Oh my God what a spread.

703
01:03:11,422 --> 01:03:13,152
Do you guys want something?

704
01:03:13,153 --> 01:03:15,105
- I'm so hungry actually. I'm starving.
- Yeah I'm dying.

705
01:03:15,106 --> 01:03:16,541
This is like my dinner.

706
01:03:17,804 --> 01:03:20,983
I've got some Wochie water, delicious.

707
01:03:20,984 --> 01:03:22,251
If you want.

708
01:03:22,252 --> 01:03:24,756
Actually it's just the last one,
so just you can split it.

709
01:03:24,757 --> 01:03:26,777
When do you drink a whole water?

710
01:03:27,857 --> 01:03:29,573
I always leave it.

711
01:03:29,574 --> 01:03:31,420
- Do you want some?
- No I'm good.

712
01:03:31,421 --> 01:03:32,483
I can open.

713
01:03:33,481 --> 01:03:34,644
This one is open.

714
01:03:34,645 --> 01:03:36,631
Thanks for coming by.

715
01:03:36,632 --> 01:03:40,838
And I'm sorry I just think I want...

716
01:03:40,839 --> 01:03:43,182
... like me alone.

717
01:03:43,183 --> 01:03:45,633
Oh yeah, of course.

718
01:03:48,944 --> 01:03:51,842
- We all just, you know, we'll call you.
- Like now.

719
01:03:54,359 --> 01:03:55,579
Okay.

720
01:03:55,580 --> 01:03:56,236
It's okay.

721
01:03:56,237 --> 01:04:00,683
- We'll go get a drink.
- Great job.

722
01:04:02,809 --> 01:04:05,413
We gonna get a drink and...

723
01:04:05,414 --> 01:04:07,208
Have a good time.

724
01:04:11,582 --> 01:04:13,361
It was awesome.

725
01:04:14,364 --> 01:04:16,196
I know!

726
01:04:16,537 --> 01:04:17,720
Bye Sarah.

727
01:04:17,721 --> 01:04:18,642
Bye-bye.

728
01:04:20,042 --> 01:04:21,943
Thank you.

729
01:04:54,883 --> 01:04:56,067
You did it, kid.

730
01:05:00,728 --> 01:05:03,485
Come over here,
I got a secret for you.

731
01:05:07,688 --> 01:05:10,034
You're fucking amazing.

732
01:05:22,784 --> 01:05:24,161
You are a star.

733
01:05:26,434 --> 01:05:29,003
And I'm a star fucker.

734
01:05:56,805 --> 01:06:03,416
I didn't get any sleep. I went to sleep at 1 in the morning.
I woke up at 3 in the morning. Because I was just excited.

735
01:06:03,571 --> 01:06:06,426
I made myself stay in bed,
but it was like this in bed.

736
01:06:08,002 --> 01:06:08,951
What are you gonna do?

737
01:06:08,952 --> 01:06:10,703
Maybe I'll take a nap. You know.

738
01:06:13,321 --> 01:06:15,312
When I'm dead. Alright?

739
01:06:16,021 --> 01:06:17,159
Fuck yeah!

740
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:19,255
What is that noise,

741
01:06:19,763 --> 01:06:21,441
It's a child laughing.

742
01:06:21,595 --> 01:06:32,240
It's really hard, guys. Seriously don't go into acting,
cause it's totally like harder work than you think.

743
01:06:32,241 --> 01:06:36,832
You know what? It just like.. I just...
It helps me realize I'm alive.

744
01:06:36,833 --> 01:06:39,392
Going out with the guy
who drives German car.

745
01:06:39,393 --> 01:06:41,843
And I'm looking for a Yin to my Yang.

746
01:06:41,844 --> 01:06:48,348
Looking for a Yin to my Yang.
He hates women too and I love it.

747
01:06:48,349 --> 01:06:49,943
So fuck you.

748
01:06:49,944 --> 01:06:51,790
A bird shit on me.

749
01:06:51,791 --> 01:06:53,402
A day before yesterday.

750
01:06:55,308 --> 01:06:56,498
Do you feel lucky?

751
01:06:56,499 --> 01:06:59,259
I felt lucky.
Yeah. I was like...

752
01:07:05,231 --> 01:07:11,476
I imagine the birds, they lay eggs and they're like
'Oh my God, I can't believe it came out of my pussy'.

753
01:07:12,766 --> 01:07:16,968
My name is Laura Silverman
I'm actually Sarah's sister.

754
01:07:16,969 --> 01:07:18,605
In real life.

755
01:07:19,646 --> 01:07:23,592
And I'm playing her friend
which I'm not in real life.

756
01:07:23,593 --> 01:07:27,898
And I'm Brian Posehn, her friend.
And I'm actually playing her sister.

757
01:07:27,899 --> 01:07:28,937
Hey guys.

758
01:07:28,938 --> 01:07:32,057
-Hey. We're doing a little...
- Hi Sarah.

759
01:07:32,058 --> 01:07:33,579
Feature out.

760
01:07:33,580 --> 01:07:34,975
In the scene we sink in.

761
01:07:34,976 --> 01:07:35,704
- Cool.
- Yeah.

762
01:07:36,525 --> 01:07:37,097
No.

763
01:07:37,098 --> 01:07:38,946
We just doing joke...

764
01:07:41,809 --> 01:07:43,457
So how is it working with Sarah?

765
01:07:43,669 --> 01:07:45,912
It's horrib... great.

766
01:07:45,913 --> 01:07:52,380
It's if you really-really into Sarah it's great.
Because Jews into Sarah.

767
01:07:52,381 --> 01:07:52,988
Yeah.

768
01:07:52,989 --> 01:07:54,836
So we have a common interest.

769
01:07:58,516 --> 01:08:02,367
Three of the actors just died from that.

770
01:08:02,368 --> 01:08:07,088
I'm 1 year and 1 month pregnant I'm 13
months pregnant, I just found out.

771
01:08:07,089 --> 01:08:10,951
That's what Steve calls
his wife - the Cuntintsky.

772
01:08:10,952 --> 01:08:12,042
I'm not married.

773
01:08:12,043 --> 01:08:13,160
Whatever.

774
01:08:13,161 --> 01:08:14,301
Fuck you.

775
01:08:14,459 --> 01:08:15,445
Fucker.

776
01:08:15,490 --> 01:08:16,609
Alright you're good there.

777
01:08:16,850 --> 01:08:18,085
Motherfucker.

778
01:08:18,086 --> 01:08:19,026
Okay guys.

779
01:08:20,715 --> 01:08:22,540
I came in here to have gas.

780
01:08:22,541 --> 01:08:29,379
Like Marla Thomas that just walked in on her father
under a coffee table with girl take mission on it.

781
01:08:29,946 --> 01:08:31,634
What's f....

782
01:08:31,635 --> 01:08:32,649
What's funny?

783
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:34,722
I would love to know what's funny?

784
01:08:34,723 --> 01:08:37,654
You guys better go.
Thanks a lot.

785
01:08:39,376 --> 01:08:41,567
Fuck. Fucking take it!

786
01:08:46,952 --> 01:08:52,171
The best time to get pregnant
is when you're a black teenager.

787
01:09:03,981 --> 01:09:06,631
Nazis are assholoes.

788
01:09:06,632 --> 01:09:13,184
But that's totally not true because
they're cute when they're little.
