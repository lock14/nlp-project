00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,060
Zomcon presents...

2
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:10,630
A Bright New World.

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,400
From the darkest depths
of outer space

4
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:18,910
came an evil no man could predict.

5
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:22,910
A cloud of radiation engulfed
our great planet.

6
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,070
Scientists discovered
that these space particles

7
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:29,240
caused the reanimation
of dead bodies--

8
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:30,380
Zombies!

9
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:33,580
Creatures with but one
destructive need--

10
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:36,390
to devour the flesh of the living.

11
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:41,060
And so, we were forced
to defend our homeland.

12
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,760
The Zombie Wars--

13
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:47,330
mankind pitted against
legions of the undead.

14
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,430
But in our darkest hour,

15
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:51,840
a savior--

16
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:55,430
Zomcon, and our founder,

17
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:58,610
Dr. Reinhold Geiger.

18
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:02,130
Dr. Geiger discovered
that if the brain was destroyed,

19
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:05,130
the zombie was destroyed,

20
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:06,490
never to reanimate.

21
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:15,410
And so, the Zombie
Wars were won.

22
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,310
Zomcon built security systems

23
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,140
Iike the perimeter fence
that encloses our towns

24
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,480
in a wall of protective steel,

25
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:26,310
and surrounds other towns
right across this great land.

26
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,720
But even within the fence,
danger lurked.

27
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:34,660
Lingering radiation meant that
anyone who died became a zombie.

28
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,660
Be careful, Mrs. Smith.

29
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,630
He's not the man you married.

30
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:41,830
And then, a breakthrough--

31
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,990
the domestication collar.

32
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,340
With the collar in place,
a red light comes on,

33
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:51,670
telling us that the zombie's desire for
human flesh has been contained,

34
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:56,690
making the zombie as gentle
as a household pet.

35
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:01,030
But if the collar light
goes out, call Zomcon,

36
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:03,690
or push the nearest
safety button

37
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,240
and we'll be there to
handle any zombie problem,

38
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,930
Iarge or small.

39
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:18,050
Thanks to Zomcon, we can all become
productive members of society,

40
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:22,050
even after we die.

41
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:24,210
Or, for those who can afford it,

42
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,720
a Zomcon funeral,
complete with head coffin,

43
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:32,060
guarantees you a burial
you won't come back from.

44
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,060
Your tax dollars
allow Zomcon new ways

45
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:37,900
to protect our homeland
from the zombie threat,

46
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,170
giving us more time to relax
and be with our families.

47
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:47,590
So thank you, Zomcon,
for winning the Zombie Wars

48
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:49,750
and building a company
for tomorrow

49
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,920
that gives us a safer
future today.

50
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:58,160
Zomcon, a better life
through containment.

51
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:10,610
Well, I think
that informative film

52
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,610
taught us all a little bit more
about how Zomcon

53
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:14,440
helps make our world
a better place,

54
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:15,780
isn't that right, children?

55
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,110
Yes, Miss Mills.

56
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,280
Our special guest is here.

57
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:21,790
Everyone straighten your desks.

58
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:28,290
Children, I would like to introduce

59
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,560
Willard's new head of security
at Zomcon,

60
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:33,960
who is not only a decorated hero of
the Zombie Wars,

61
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:37,530
but is also Zomcon's
official safety expert.

62
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,980
Mr. Bottoms is the father
of our newest,

63
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,990
and I suspect our brightest student, Cindy.

64
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:51,490
Well, good afternoon,
boys and girls.

65
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:55,830
So how many of you have ever had
to kill a zombie?

66
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,420
Ooh. Not too many,

67
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:01,330
and that's the way I'd like to keep it.

68
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,340
My job at Zomcon is to make things safe
for young people just like you.

69
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,340
That's why I'm building
a taller fence,

70
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:12,350
and there are going to be
new safety vans patrolling our streets.

71
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:15,850
And we're going to take
everybody's picture

72
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:18,510
just in case one of you...
gets lost.

73
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,920
What do you think of that?

74
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:27,150
Children, does anyone
have a question for Mr. Bottoms?

75
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,420
Yes, Roy.

76
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:31,690
Stan and me--
I mean, me and Stan,

77
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,110
have been Zomcon Cadets
for two years, sir.

78
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:36,210
We think Zomcon's great.

79
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,110
That's terrific. Thank you.

80
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:41,380
Does anyone have
an actual question?

81
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,590
Timmy Robinson has a question.

82
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:48,720
Timmy, go on.

83
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,060
Ask a good question.

84
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,300
Timmy?

85
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,430
Are zombies dead or alive?

86
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:02,740
- What a stupid question.
- Really stupid.

87
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:07,750
Now, now, now.
There's no such thing as a stupid question.

88
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:11,750
The truth is, to some people,
zombies might seem human.

89
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,320
But make no mistake,

90
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,750
these creatures have
only one goal,

91
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:18,420
and that is to eat your flesh.

92
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:22,430
So without Zomcon,
we'd all be dead.

93
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,120
And then where would we be?

94
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:26,140
- Dead?
- Dead?

95
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,180
That's right.

96
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,140
So does that answer
your question, Timmy?

97
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,040
I guess.

98
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:33,450
You guess?

99
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:36,110
Well, this isn't a world
where we guess, young man.

100
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:38,050
You either know
something or you don't.

101
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:41,120
I was just thinking
about the zombies

102
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:44,130
who were buried too deep
to get out of their coffins.

103
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:47,130
Well, that's impossible.
We always bury the heads separately.

104
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:50,720
I mean people buried
before the space dust.

105
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:53,630
Couldn't some of them
still be in the graveyard right now,

106
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,470
trying to claw their way out?

107
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:57,970
Yuck.

108
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:05,470
Well, children, look at that.

109
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:08,310
It's time for outdoor education.

110
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:11,290
Let's show Mr. Bottoms
how good we are, hmm?

111
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,820
In the brain
and not the chest

112
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,650
Head shots are the very best

113
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,820
In the brain
and not the chest

114
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:21,670
Head shots are the very best

115
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:24,500
In the brain
and not the chest

116
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:27,080
Head shots are the very best

117
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,010
Trying to make
Zomcon look stupid?

118
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,450
That wouldn't be hard.

119
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,020
What did you say?

120
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,110
Nothing.

121
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,630
- Okay, mister.
- But it's out of bullets!

122
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:19,570
It felt empty.

123
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,580
A good cadet always knows
how many bullets he has left, son.

124
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,080
- You idiot.
- That's it.

125
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,240
Detention, the pair of you.

126
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:28,580
That's not fair.

127
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:32,250
But he said Zomcon was stupid.

128
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,260
Did you say that?

129
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,650
No, no.

130
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,810
Pick up the box.

131
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,390
Don't drop--

132
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:33,320
That's Mr. Bottoms' lamp.

133
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:34,980
If that could go to the den.

134
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:36,990
It's just to your right...

135
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,070
It's very fragile.

136
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,430
Hey, Timmy!

137
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:52,570
Hi, Mr. Theopolis.

138
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:03,460
That's no way to treat a bicycle.

139
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:06,870
Sorry, Mrs. Henderson.

140
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:10,200
What have I told you about
leaving you bike on the lawn?

141
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:11,640
Now put it away properly.

142
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,740
Was that so hard?

143
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:18,370
Yes, Mrs. Henderson.

144
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,710
What did you say?

145
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,410
I mean, no, Mrs. Henderson.

146
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,250
What are you looking at,
Theopolis?

147
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:39,730
I'm going to take this apple pie
over to our new neighbors.

148
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,400
See if they actually
own all those zombies.

149
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:44,060
They probably do.

150
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:46,400
He's the new
head of security at Zomcon.

151
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:49,770
The new head of security
moved into the Johnsons' old place.

152
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:54,260
Well, that's good news.

153
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,090
What on earth, Timmy?

154
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,600
That is a new shirt.

155
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,100
It was those bullies
I told you about.

156
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,470
They pushed me down,
and Stan pointed his gun at me.

157
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:07,100
What?

158
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:09,270
Did people see you like this?

159
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:11,640
I don't know.

160
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:15,040
Come here.

161
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,620
There you go.
Everything's going to be fine.

162
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:23,450
Just go and clean up,
put on a new shirt,

163
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,530
and we won't even have to
talk about those bullies.

164
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:36,540
Oh, there's one other thing.

165
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:15,920
Hi, honey.

166
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,420
Made just the way you like it.

167
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:28,860
A three olive martini.

168
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:31,830
What did I do to deserve this?

169
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:39,710
Helen, what are you up to?

170
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,380
I've had a long day.

171
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:45,220
Oh, Bill, honestly.
Sometimes I wonder about you.

172
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,550
I really do.

173
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,890
If you must know,

174
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,960
I have a surprise for you.

175
00:11:58,670 --> 00:11:59,870
Wow.

176
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:03,240
Hi, Dad.

177
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:05,570
Hiya, Tim.

178
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,770
- How's my boy?
- Fine.

179
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,070
- Are you ready?
- There's more?

180
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:11,710
Now, just relax.

181
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:32,610
Isn't it wonderful?

182
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,180
Now we're not the only ones
on the street without one.

183
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:54,500
Helen, could I speak to you
in the kitchen?

184
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,400
Of course, dear.
You're always so sensible.

185
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:02,640
Timmy, why don't you
go watch some television?

186
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:03,800
Yeah, but, Mom, I don't--

187
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:05,710
I'm sure there's
something wonderful on.

188
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,310
But, Bill, the neighbors.

189
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,480
Everybody has one except for us.

190
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:20,820
Well, Helen, in lndia
everyone has a tiger.

191
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:22,830
Why don't we just move there
and get a tiger?

192
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:25,330
Not everybody in lndia
has a tiger, Bill.

193
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:26,740
That's what I heard.

194
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:29,510
We can't afford a zombie.

195
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:32,680
I'm barely keeping up with
funeral payments as it is.

196
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:35,020
Funerals. Is that all you ever
think about, Bill?

197
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,350
I still can't believe you bought
a funeral savings plan for Timmy.

198
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,220
Come on, Helen.

199
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:42,350
The other kids hate him.

200
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,190
You said so yourself.

201
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,090
Bill!

202
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:50,370
I met our new neighbors today.

203
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:54,870
Did you know that he is the new head
of security for Zomcon?

204
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:56,870
Really?

205
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:59,210
That's who moved into
the old Johnson place?

206
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:06,550
Uh-huh. And did you know
that they have six zombies. Six!

207
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:08,710
And when his wife asked me
how many we had,

208
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:12,380
I didn't know what to say.

209
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:14,220
So I told her we had one.

210
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:15,380
You what?

211
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:16,550
What was I supposed to do?

212
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:19,330
Tell her that my husband
is afraid of zombies?

213
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,670
I'm not going to talk about this.

214
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:38,190
Hey.

215
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:39,260
Zombie?

216
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:45,660
The roast.

217
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,780
- Dad.
- Sorry.

218
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:08,690
I thought that was
a different button.

219
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:12,630
Whoops.

220
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,600
What are you doing?
It's hurting him.

221
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:17,140
Sorry. I...

222
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,970
You know,
I bet with our new neighbor,

223
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,310
we'll have the safest
street in Willard.

224
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:24,940
I can't argue with that.

225
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:26,980
And, obviously,
it will be chained up

226
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:28,820
in the backyard
when it's not doing chores.

227
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,890
Obviously.

228
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:33,820
It'll have to be.

229
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:36,160
Helen, propriety.

230
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,730
You're the boss, dear.

231
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:54,850
Afraid of zombies.

232
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:57,350
I'll tell you what
I'm afraid of, little lady.

233
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:59,540
Nothing, that's what.

234
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:04,910
Just stay right there.

235
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:15,540
Think I'm afraid of you?

236
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,040
Huh?

237
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:19,270
That what you think?

238
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:23,620
That's right.

239
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:32,960
That's right.

240
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:22,680
Nicely done, Tammy.

241
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:27,860
No.

242
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,370
Grandpa's fallen
and he's getting up.

243
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:50,980
The elderly.

244
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,820
They seem friendly enough,
but can you really trust them?

245
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:54,860
No.

246
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,660
So don't get caught off guard.

247
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:59,500
Buy the Zomcon Zombie Alert
heart monitor.

248
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,400
When the heart stops, we start.

249
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,550
Aren't you going to
help me practice, Dad?

250
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,750
Oh, is that today?

251
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:25,350
You already changed it
from yesterday.

252
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:28,520
But I've already got
the driving range booked.

253
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:31,500
Don't other dads take their kids
to the driving range?

254
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:36,700
No.

255
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:38,100
No, they don't.

256
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:51,550
Honey, honey.

257
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,720
Please don't play
baseball by yourself.

258
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:55,460
It makes you look lonely.

259
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:58,570
Now, I'm going over to meet
our new neighbors.

260
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,300
But you said you already
met the neighbors.

261
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:03,170
Timmy, I thought
you were on my side.

262
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:23,490
Give it here.

263
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,760
Come on, stupid. Throw it.

264
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:30,390
It's a baseball.

265
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,400
You throw it.

266
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:39,190
You throw like a girl.

267
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,830
Did it again.

268
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:32,540
It's so dumb.

269
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:34,020
Ow!

270
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,180
What are you doing?

271
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:36,520
It wasn't me.

272
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,590
You shot me with a B.B. gun.

273
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:43,520
Get him!

274
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,240
So, where do you want
to get shot?

275
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:54,030
Head shot, Roy.

276
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:56,700
That's the first smart thing
you've said all day.

277
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:58,280
- Roy!
- Leave me alone!

278
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:01,110
Ow, my arm.

279
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:02,770
My arm.

280
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:07,050
Stay away from me.

281
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:09,880
Stop, zombie! Stop!

282
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:11,790
Let's get out of here.

283
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:26,080
And that loser Stan,

284
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:28,080
I thought he was
going to pee himself.

285
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:31,580
Crying like a sucky baby.

286
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:35,250
They sure won't
pick on me again...

287
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,330
at least not when you're around.

288
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:44,090
What?

289
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,430
Do you want to play?

290
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,830
Okay.

291
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:58,400
We should get a name for you
before Mom does.

292
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:01,110
I know.

293
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,680
How about Fido?

294
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:11,360
Nice catch, Fido.

295
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:21,310
Well, if you're not going to catch it,

296
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:23,710
you got to go fetch it.

297
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,040
Go get it, boy.

298
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:32,490
Come on, boy.

299
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:35,320
You're disgusting.

300
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:37,400
Why don't you go home
and get some clothes on?

301
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,230
If your mother could see you now.

302
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:45,100
Can't bear to look at you.

303
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,850
You rotten zombie!

304
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:01,820
You nearly scared me half to death.

305
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,050
Stop that!

306
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:06,350
You're spoiling my quiet time!

307
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:23,380
Fido?

308
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:24,710
Hello?

309
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:28,620
Oh, jeez.

310
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:32,050
Fido!

311
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:52,150
Stupid collar.

312
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:57,580
That's Mrs. Henderson.

313
00:23:57,690 --> 00:23:59,980
What am I supposed
to tell Mom and Dad?

314
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:07,930
You're not supposed to
even be off your leash.

315
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,870
Dad's going to kill me.

316
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:12,840
Come on.
I got to get you cleaned up.

317
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:40,900
Hi, Cindy.

318
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:43,470
My mom and your mom
think we should be friends.

319
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:46,200
Oh.

320
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:47,280
Sorry.

321
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:49,140
That's okay. I don't mind.

322
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:51,650
Well, bye.

323
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:57,090
You're not allowed to have a zombie
without a leash.

324
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:58,160
You're a kid.

325
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:00,630
I don't care about
stupid Zomcon rules.

326
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:05,400
Here comes my dad,
and he sure cares.

327
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:18,550
- Hello, Tommy.
- It's Timmy.

328
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:20,590
Right you are, sweetheart.

329
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,220
Is that blood on your zombie?

330
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:30,130
Uh, it was a nosebleed.

331
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:32,530
Well, that's not a fresh zombie.

332
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:34,930
Only fresh zombies bleed, son.

333
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,370
I meant my nose.

334
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:40,530
How did blood from your nose
get on to your zombie, then?

335
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,700
I wiped it there.

336
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,210
Daddy, can we go now?

337
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:47,870
I can't be late for
my first ballet class.

338
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:50,540
All right, princess.
Get in. Come on.

339
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:54,530
Okay. Bye, Timmy.

340
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:56,120
I hate ballet.

341
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:12,310
I think we're in trouble, boy.

342
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:27,860
Hmm.
Heart attack, eh?

343
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:31,160
My grandpa had a heart attack.

344
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:41,770
You're not so bad, are you, boy?

345
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:44,540
Too bad you had to go
and eat Mrs. Henderson.

346
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,130
- I don't even want to ask.
- He got dirty.

347
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:53,460
And how on earth did he get dirty?

348
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,970
We were just in the park--

349
00:26:56,070 --> 00:27:01,030
What were you doing
in the park with the zombie?

350
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:08,640
You stupid zombie.

351
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:12,150
Look at what you've done.

352
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:15,150
I'll never get it cleaned up in time,

353
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:17,660
and in your father's garage!

354
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,820
You're not allowed in here.
You know that, Timmy.

355
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:22,090
Mom, when we were
in the park--

356
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,500
Timmy, are you listening to me?

357
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,500
Your father is going to
send the zombie back.

358
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,830
No, Dad always does
what you say.

359
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,670
No, not this time.

360
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:34,500
Not with a zombie.

361
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:37,480
And then what are
people going to say?

362
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:40,680
They're going to say

363
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:43,190
that the Robinsons are strange,

364
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:44,760
and they're going to be right.

365
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,130
It's nothing, Mom.

366
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:51,700
We'll clean this mess up.

367
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,000
Dad won't even know.

368
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:56,870
I promise.

369
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:02,380
What was so important that
you needed to tell me, Timmy?

370
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,210
Um, it's Fido.

371
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,150
He protected me
from the bullies.

372
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:09,450
Fido? Who's Fido?

373
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:15,190
Fido.

374
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:17,890
What kind of
a stupid name is Fido?

375
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,230
Who names their zombie, anyway?

376
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:22,560
Lots of people name
their zombies.

377
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:25,900
Mr. Theopolis has a name for his.

378
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,240
I bet he does.

379
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:34,250
At any rate,
zombies don't have heart attacks.

380
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:37,420
No, I mean before,

381
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:39,430
when he was alive.

382
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:43,160
That's what killed him,
like Grandpa.

383
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:51,840
What--

384
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:01,150
You know you're not
supposed to talk about your grandfather.

385
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:03,270
Sorry.

386
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,440
I forgot.

387
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:06,950
Well, that's quite a thing to forget.

388
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:16,560
And she's missing since this morning?

389
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:19,100
Well, she's always
wandering off on her own.

390
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,460
I'm sure she'll turn up.

391
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:24,370
Mr. Henderson should have put her
in a retirement home years ago.

392
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:26,310
Really, Bill!

393
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:29,750
What would Francis do without her?
He'd be all alone.

394
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:33,150
Those homes are very comfortable
and...secure.

395
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:36,820
They're only secure because
they use the old prison.

396
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:44,770
Well...she is over 65, Helen,

397
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:47,530
and old people can't be trusted.

398
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,940
Isn't that right?

399
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:52,070
Yeah, we had a lot of trouble
with old people during the war.

400
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:53,400
Jonathan, please.

401
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:56,640
He never gets tired of talking about
that dreadful war.

402
00:29:58,150 --> 00:29:59,480
You must have been, what, 1 0?

403
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,910
Uh... 1 1.

404
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:03,510
Any kills?

405
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:06,650
Just...one.

406
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,350
Someone close to home?

407
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:13,850
It was his father.

408
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:17,530
But you're fine now, aren't you, honey?

409
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,810
Yep.

410
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:21,750
Well, you did what
you had to, Robinson.

411
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:24,370
It's a terrible thing,
the Zombie War.

412
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:27,110
Families having to kill their own.

413
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,920
Never lose sight of that.

414
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:31,120
I'd take Dee Dee's head off
in a second if I had to.

415
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,290
He always says that.

416
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,830
Don't let 'em get too close.

417
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:40,900
It makes it harder to pull the trigger.

418
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:53,780
Well, that went well.

419
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,310
What is it, Timmy?

420
00:30:57,420 --> 00:31:01,250
I just hope a zombie
didn't get Mrs. Henderson.

421
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,760
What a thing to say.

422
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:06,590
Well, what if somebody's
zombie did attack her?

423
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:07,790
What then?

424
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:10,520
Well, we all remember
what happened to the Johnsons

425
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:13,200
when their zombie
ate those Christmas carolers.

426
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:16,110
Did Zomcon really chuck them
into the Wild Zone?

427
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:18,770
That's probably how
the Bottoms got their house.

428
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,010
Bill.

429
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:23,490
Let's just say there's a very good reason
we don't have prisons anymore.

430
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,750
Bill.

431
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:27,520
Well, Helen,
he's gotta learn someday.

432
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:29,620
Can't keep denying it.

433
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:34,100
Timmy, I think it's nice that you're
caring so much about Mrs. Henderson.

434
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,500
But I think she's gonna be just fine.

435
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:08,530
Come here.
Come on! Come on!

436
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,010
Come on. No more mistakes
on Daddy's rug.

437
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:14,600
No, no, no. We're not going anywhere
until you do your business.

438
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,180
Spike, come here.

439
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,250
You're being a naughty boy
tonight, huh?

440
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:22,150
Why are you being such a naughty boy
tonight, huh?

441
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:06,040
Oh, no.

442
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:17,520
Stay away, Mrs. Henderson.

443
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:42,140
Sorry, Mrs. Henderson.

444
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:58,730
You weren't very nice,
Mrs. Henderson.

445
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:01,270
But I'm really sorry you're dead.

446
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:03,810
Now you're in a garden.

447
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:06,380
You always liked plants.

448
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,640
So I hope that's okay.

449
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:55,900
Shh. You'll wake up
Mom and Dad.

450
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,140
Fido?

451
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:04,910
Oh, no. Your collar.

452
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:08,440
Hey, Timmy?

453
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:10,990
Zombie troubles?

454
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:18,590
Okay.
Now, Tammy.

455
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,160
All right.

456
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:22,460
Okay.

457
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,290
It's okay, boy.

458
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:28,630
Hey!

459
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:30,600
You trying to get yourself killed?

460
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:32,140
No.

461
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,440
Let me tell you something.

462
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:36,780
I've had some pretty
close calls with my Tammy.

463
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,190
Lookee here.

464
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:41,630
You want that?

465
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:49,260
Not the teeth, Tammy.
Not the teeth, Tammy.

466
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:50,960
Good girl.

467
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:52,440
She looks good for a zombie.

468
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:54,740
Same as the day I met her.

469
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:59,250
She was shopping in the grocery store
for candy corn with her mom.

470
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:01,140
Had some kind of
a brain aneurysm.

471
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:05,280
They slapped a collar on her before
she even hit the floor.

472
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:08,290
Got her before there was
any decomposition.

473
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:10,690
Where'd you get all this stuff?

474
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:13,890
Part of my severance package
when I quit Zomcon.

475
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,500
Hey!
Will you look at that?

476
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,790
Watch this.

477
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,130
Here you go, Sparky.

478
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:29,600
You used to be a smoker, boy?

479
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:30,840
Old habits die hard.

480
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:36,020
You wanna rip
my face off, don't you.

481
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:39,460
Oh, yes.

482
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,930
You wanna eat me for dinner.

483
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:44,660
How come zombies wanna eat people?

484
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:47,360
You know...

485
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:49,170
I don't know.

486
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:53,070
Geiger used to say it was their way
of trying to come back to life.

487
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:55,540
Would that work?

488
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,880
Not a chance.

489
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:01,850
He was a strange bird, Geiger.

490
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:04,850
I think that when
his wife went zombie,

491
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,690
he couldn't stand the thought
of losing her.

492
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:10,820
That's why he invented the collar
in the first place.

493
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,790
Okay.

494
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,990
Go ahead, Tammy.

495
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:22,030
Now...

496
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:24,840
not a word of this to anyone.

497
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:27,920
Not your mom, not your dad.

498
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:30,180
This will be our little secret...

499
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:32,590
or it's free lawn mowing for a year.

500
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:33,960
Yes, sir.

501
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:22,350
Much better. There you go.

502
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:27,450
Is that Dad's suit?

503
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,720
Yes.

504
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:31,850
And we don't need to
mention it to your father.

505
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,290
He won't even notice.

506
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,590
You look great, boy.

507
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,460
Not bad at all.

508
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:48,210
Hurry, your father's waiting.

509
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:49,470
Do we have to go?

510
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:51,280
These Sunday drives are
very important to your father.

511
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:54,040
How would it look if we didn't
go together as a family?

512
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:56,180
But it's weird.

513
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:58,380
We never know anybody.

514
00:38:58,490 --> 00:39:00,290
Well, maybe this time we will.

515
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:33,360
Oh, I love this park.
It's so peaceful.

516
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:41,410
Come here, puppy.
Come on.

517
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:43,310
Come have some cheese.

518
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:45,840
Have some cheese.

519
00:39:57,730 --> 00:40:00,690
They seem, in the view
of the foolish, to be dead.

520
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:03,490
and their passing away
was part of affliction,

521
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:06,270
and their going forth
from us utter destruction.

522
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:09,110
But they are in peace.

523
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:12,440
For if before men indeed
they be punished...

524
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:15,350
Is that zombie wearing my suit?

525
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:17,850
What would you suggest, Bill?
That I buy him a new one?

526
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,980
Why didn't you leave him
the way he was?

527
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:22,220
They way he was dressed?
Come on, Bill.

528
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,530
Head coffin, please.

529
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,940
Head coffin.

530
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,510
This guy's not coming back,
you can bet on that.

531
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:37,940
Shh.

532
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,840
Look. This is the best part.

533
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:43,040
Emmitt Mitchell,
from dust have you come

534
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:44,940
and to dust shall you return...

535
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:49,250
...and from dust shall
you not be resurrected.

536
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:04,770
So if a person dies
and becomes a zombie,

537
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,810
then they're not really dead.

538
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,210
No, not really.

539
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,120
Well...

540
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:17,050
it's like being in purgatory
before going to heaven.

541
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:19,960
What is your father doing?

542
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:23,790
So...zombies are sinners?

543
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:28,860
I-- I suppose
we're all sinners, honey.

544
00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:32,170
But God sees
the good in everyone.

545
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:35,970
God loves zombies, too?
Even when they kill?

546
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:40,310
Well, l-- I think zombies kill
because it's their nature.

547
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:42,210
So then it's not their fault.

548
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:44,310
No, not really.

549
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:46,820
What are you so happy about?

550
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,850
I was just gonna
tell you something.

551
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,750
You know what Herman
the gravedigger just told me?

552
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:53,530
- Bill, Timmy was--
- Only 10% of people get funerals.

553
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:56,630
Most become zombies.
Can you believe that?

554
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:59,900
Well, they are expensive.

555
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:02,270
I'd rather be a zombie than dead.

556
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:04,010
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on there!

557
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:06,050
Timmy is making observations
about the world.

558
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:07,210
I think it's healthy.

559
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,720
Observation about the world?

560
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:11,250
He's a kid.
What does he know?

561
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,020
He knows a lot.

562
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:15,720
At least he's not
obsessed with funerals.

563
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:18,020
Better than focusing
on walking corpses...

564
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:20,190
who should be buried...

565
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:21,790
without their heads.

566
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:26,930
Hey!

567
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,700
We're all getting funerals.

568
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:30,830
All three of us!

569
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:34,930
Bill, get your own funeral.

570
00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:38,340
Timmy and I are going zombie.

571
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:53,230
Would you look at that?

572
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:56,970
Zomcon at the Hendersons'.

573
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:59,410
I wonder why they're
taking Francis away.

574
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:02,540
He probably gave her
an illegal funeral...

575
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:04,670
without a permit.

576
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:06,120
Is that bad?

577
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:07,350
Oh, yes.

578
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:14,820
Oh, dear!

579
00:43:14,930 --> 00:43:17,090
This is how it always starts.

580
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,930
Oh, Bill.

581
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:21,660
One wild zombie, Helen.
That's all it takes.

582
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:44,560
Hey, that's the schoolteacher.

583
00:43:46,270 --> 00:43:48,570
Any sign of the old lady?

584
00:43:51,310 --> 00:43:53,740
God, I hate old people!

585
00:43:55,510 --> 00:43:58,070
I'll be right back.

586
00:44:02,290 --> 00:44:04,410
It's just water, boy.
Come on!

587
00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:09,020
You missed a spot.

588
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:03,110
Hi, boys.

589
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:05,190
Hi, Mom.

590
00:45:05,290 --> 00:45:08,090
I thought you two might be thirsty.

591
00:45:12,370 --> 00:45:15,270
Timmy! Timmy!
Don't be cruel.

592
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:19,600
Timmy!

593
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:25,190
What's going on?

594
00:45:25,290 --> 00:45:28,520
I was just bringing
the boys something to drink.

595
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:30,680
Zombies don't drink, Helen.

596
00:45:30,790 --> 00:45:32,960
Yes, they can, Bill.
They just don't have to.

597
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,060
We can pretend, can't we?

598
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:38,330
It doesn't hurt anybody, does it?

599
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:40,130
Hey!

600
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:43,200
Give me that.

601
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:51,740
This is detail work.

602
00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:56,620
It needs to be done delicately
if you're gonna protect the finish.

603
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,420
That's why they call it
"a man's job."

604
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:01,550
Flesh-eating maniacs
need not apply.

605
00:46:09,770 --> 00:46:10,990
Hey, Helen.

606
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:12,730
Floyd.

607
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:14,740
Hey, get a move on, Robinson.

608
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:18,010
Um...

609
00:46:19,450 --> 00:46:22,080
Why don't you...
stay with us today,

610
00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:24,450
and we can be a family?

611
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:25,860
Besides, you don't even like Floyd.

612
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:27,720
You told me yourself.

613
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:29,820
I said Floyd cheats at golf.

614
00:46:29,930 --> 00:46:32,300
I didn't say I didn't like him.

615
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:36,100
Bill...

616
00:46:38,610 --> 00:46:41,070
I have a secret to tell you.

617
00:46:41,170 --> 00:46:44,410
You-- You're all wet, Helen.

618
00:46:46,850 --> 00:46:48,840
I only had one rule.

619
00:46:48,950 --> 00:46:50,140
Which rule was that?

620
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:52,410
Very funny, mister.

621
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:54,380
Get this zombie chained up.

622
00:46:57,620 --> 00:46:58,990
Now!

623
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:16,180
Bye, honey!

624
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,300
Now what is that?

625
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:32,530
This is her walker...thingy, sir.

626
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:35,830
At least that's what our witnesses say.

627
00:47:37,110 --> 00:47:41,010
We caught these two in the bushes
firing their.22s at the wild zombies.

628
00:47:42,210 --> 00:47:43,610
The little one?

629
00:47:43,710 --> 00:47:45,700
Shot Dougie in the leg.

630
00:47:48,390 --> 00:47:50,350
Get that out of sight, will ya?

631
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:56,050
It's a boot. Put it back.

632
00:47:57,230 --> 00:47:58,890
So let me get this straight.

633
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,760
You're saying that the Robinson zombie
tried to eat you

634
00:48:02,870 --> 00:48:05,850
and then moved on
to Mrs. Henderson.

635
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:07,380
Is that right?

636
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:09,740
Yes, sir.

637
00:48:09,850 --> 00:48:12,750
Well, I don't see any bite marks.

638
00:48:12,850 --> 00:48:15,250
Well, he actually didn't
try to bite us.

639
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:16,980
Shut up, Stan!

640
00:48:17,090 --> 00:48:18,790
He broke my arm.

641
00:48:18,890 --> 00:48:20,260
Do you know what I think?

642
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:26,930
I think that you shot the old lady
just like, uh...

643
00:48:27,030 --> 00:48:28,470
just like you shot
Dougie over there.

644
00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:33,400
No way! It's all
Timmy Robinson's fault.

645
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:41,650
You got nothing
to worry about now, boy.

646
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:43,380
Dad loves ya!

647
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:50,850
Come on!

648
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:54,880
They'll never split us up, Fido! Ever!

649
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,690
Whoo!

650
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:00,880
Come on, boy!

651
00:49:20,530 --> 00:49:23,860
That was fun, boy.

652
00:49:23,970 --> 00:49:25,370
Did you like swimming?

653
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:29,630
You know,
I didn't even know you could swim.

654
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:35,940
We gotta get you back
before Dad comes home.

655
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:42,750
Don't do anything, boy.

656
00:49:42,850 --> 00:49:43,980
"Boy"?

657
00:49:44,090 --> 00:49:45,420
Let's just shoot him now, Roy.

658
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:49,520
Nah. Let's stick to the plan.

659
00:49:52,270 --> 00:49:53,470
What are you doing?

660
00:49:53,570 --> 00:49:55,300
We're gonna be heroes.

661
00:49:55,410 --> 00:49:57,430
What-- What are you
talking about?

662
00:49:57,540 --> 00:49:59,440
We know your zombie
killed the old lady.

663
00:49:59,550 --> 00:50:03,280
We told Bottoms, and he's gonna send
your whole family to the Wild Zone.

664
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:04,480
- What?
- Shut up, Stan!

665
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:07,210
He would have believed us, too,
if you'd let me do the talking.

666
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:10,310
-You're the one who blew it.
- Shut up! You're wrecking the fun.

667
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:11,520
- I'm just saying--
- Shut up!

668
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:13,990
- Roy, stop telling me--
- Shut up!

669
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,090
Okay, Robinson...

670
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:21,100
I'm gonna shoot him dead
just before he gets to you.

671
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,690
I'm gonna save your life
from the zombie.

672
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,000
He's gonna pay for everything.

673
00:50:25,810 --> 00:50:27,640
Do it, Roy!

674
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:32,000
Jeez, Roy! Blast him!

675
00:50:39,550 --> 00:50:41,880
Oh, crap! You made me
shoot my stupid brother!

676
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:17,620
Oh, jeez!

677
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:26,200
Please don't eat me, Fido.

678
00:51:31,710 --> 00:51:33,910
I knew you wouldn't eat me, boy.

679
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:35,850
I knew it.

680
00:51:35,950 --> 00:51:37,350
Hurry and untie me.

681
00:51:39,770 --> 00:51:43,200
You're right, boy.
It's not gonna work.

682
00:51:47,870 --> 00:51:49,970
You gotta go for help.

683
00:51:53,750 --> 00:51:55,540
You better clean up first.

684
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:01,520
Quick, Fido.

685
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:03,110
Please!

686
00:52:06,090 --> 00:52:08,930
Good boy!
That'll hold him.

687
00:52:13,830 --> 00:52:15,560
Now go get Mom.

688
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:18,500
Fido, wait!

689
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:21,770
You promise not to eat Mom, right?

690
00:52:44,070 --> 00:52:45,600
I got it!

691
00:52:45,710 --> 00:52:47,970
I got it! Stand aside.

692
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:50,310
- It's Joe Peterson.
- Not anymore he ain't.

693
00:52:52,650 --> 00:52:54,410
Well...

694
00:53:03,890 --> 00:53:05,690
Little rusty.

695
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:07,130
Okay.

696
00:53:09,470 --> 00:53:11,190
Bull's-eye.

697
00:53:22,610 --> 00:53:24,480
Hey.

698
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:26,680
Nice shot.

699
00:53:33,730 --> 00:53:36,700
Goodness, Fido, you scared me.

700
00:53:40,170 --> 00:53:42,610
What is it?
Where's Timmy?

701
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:45,180
What...

702
00:53:47,810 --> 00:53:49,710
What...

703
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:52,840
Is something wrong?
Is Timmy in trouble?

704
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:07,620
Please, someone help!

705
00:54:12,170 --> 00:54:15,270
Which way, Fido?
Is this the right way?

706
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:18,980
Hold on.

707
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:28,560
Your collar!

708
00:54:37,810 --> 00:54:39,210
Why aren't you eating me?

709
00:54:42,610 --> 00:54:46,050
For goodness sake, Fido.

710
00:55:04,670 --> 00:55:06,730
Help!

711
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:08,360
Which way now, Fido?

712
00:55:28,970 --> 00:55:30,630
Help! Help!

713
00:55:30,740 --> 00:55:32,330
Get away!

714
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,330
Mom!

715
00:56:01,430 --> 00:56:03,130
Oh, Timmy!

716
00:56:04,170 --> 00:56:06,080
Thank God you're all right.

717
00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:12,080
God! Timmy!

718
00:56:14,820 --> 00:56:18,280
You crazy wonderful zombie.

719
00:56:50,390 --> 00:56:52,380
You never saw this.

720
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:09,650
They were zombies, and they
were going to kill you.

721
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:10,980
I know, Mom.

722
00:57:11,090 --> 00:57:12,460
I did what I had to do.

723
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:13,820
I know.

724
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:18,630
And I don't want you thinking that what we did
is normal or okay in any way.

725
00:57:19,730 --> 00:57:21,530
I don't.

726
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:52,540
- Nice shot.
- Thanks.

727
00:57:56,210 --> 00:57:58,610
It's so nice to see
Cindy with a friend.

728
00:57:58,710 --> 00:58:00,440
She doesn't have many?

729
00:58:00,550 --> 00:58:02,610
We're always moving.
It's...

730
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:05,280
It's hard for any of us
to make friends.

731
00:58:05,390 --> 00:58:08,320
Jonathan seems
to like it that way.

732
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:12,920
Bill's lived in Willard his entire life,
and he still doesn't have any friends.

733
00:58:13,030 --> 00:58:15,120
And he definitely likes it that way.

734
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:19,770
He must be excited
about the new baby.

735
00:58:21,270 --> 00:58:23,740
He hasn't even noticed.

736
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:26,770
How could he not notice?

737
00:58:32,210 --> 00:58:33,940
You want another beer?

738
00:58:34,050 --> 00:58:36,310
I wouldn't say no.

739
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:38,080
Dee Dee, get us a couple of
cold ones, will ya?

740
00:58:38,190 --> 00:58:39,550
Coming right up, dear.

741
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:43,350
Hey. You're not actually gonna get him
another beer, are you?

742
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:46,870
Get your own beer, Bill.

743
00:58:52,450 --> 00:58:55,070
Come on. Let me
show you the war room.

744
00:59:19,310 --> 00:59:21,770
So that Helen of yours...

745
00:59:23,410 --> 00:59:26,640
What a live wire.

746
00:59:26,750 --> 00:59:29,810
"Get your own beer, Bill."

747
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:33,580
Makes you wonder what's going on
in that little head of hers.

748
00:59:33,690 --> 00:59:35,850
You can say that again.

749
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:39,330
My first kill.

750
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:43,060
That is Uncle Bob.

751
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:50,700
Now, I gather it was
Helen's idea to get a zombie.

752
00:59:50,810 --> 00:59:53,680
Yes, it was.

753
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:56,410
She seems pretty friendly with it.

754
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:04,250
What are you suggesting?

755
01:00:05,290 --> 01:00:08,460
Look, Robinson, when people
get attached to their zombies,

756
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:11,120
it, uh-- it only spells trouble.

757
01:00:11,230 --> 01:00:15,140
Trouble for me,
trouble for you...

758
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:16,860
trouble for Mrs. Henderson.

759
01:00:18,610 --> 01:00:20,230
Mrs.-- Mrs. Henderson?

760
01:00:20,340 --> 01:00:21,830
Somebody's zombie got her.

761
01:00:21,940 --> 01:00:23,410
Did they?

762
01:00:23,510 --> 01:00:27,040
Well, I don't know, Robinson.
Why don't you tell me.

763
01:00:28,850 --> 01:00:32,960
Chances are you know
a lot more than you think.

764
01:00:37,540 --> 01:00:39,270
Well, that was fun.

765
01:00:40,510 --> 01:00:42,970
Timmy, go to bed.

766
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:45,910
Helen, we have to talk.

767
01:00:46,010 --> 01:00:48,610
Oh, lighten up, Bill.

768
01:00:48,710 --> 01:00:50,180
Helen.

769
01:00:54,350 --> 01:00:57,950
I am trying to have a serious discussion
with you, Helen.

770
01:00:59,830 --> 01:01:02,320
Turn that off, Helen!

771
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:06,930
What is that damn zombie
doing in my E-Z Boy?

772
01:01:10,070 --> 01:01:12,260
Bill.

773
01:01:12,370 --> 01:01:14,970
We haven't danced
since our wedding night.

774
01:01:15,070 --> 01:01:16,940
This is hardly the time.

775
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:19,880
Come on, Bill.
Dance with me.

776
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:21,640
I don't--

777
01:01:23,450 --> 01:01:25,520
Helen.

778
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:40,170
That...is enough.

779
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:45,700
Well, if you're not
gonna dance with me,

780
01:01:45,810 --> 01:01:48,040
I know someone who will.

781
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:29,600
Bill! Bill!

782
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:37,940
Nighty-night.

783
01:02:48,750 --> 01:02:51,550
I'm sorry about Bill.
He's...

784
01:02:51,660 --> 01:02:53,280
He's just...

785
01:03:01,100 --> 01:03:04,130
I wish I would have known you before.

786
01:03:06,540 --> 01:03:08,510
Before you died.

787
01:03:12,220 --> 01:03:13,920
Do you remember that?

788
01:03:37,850 --> 01:03:39,470
Can I see that?

789
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:52,130
"Timmy... R."

790
01:04:32,210 --> 01:04:33,470
Fido?

791
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:38,980
Fido!

792
01:04:47,630 --> 01:04:49,090
What are you doing with Fido?

793
01:04:49,190 --> 01:04:53,790
Oh, I think we both know
what's gonna happen to Fido.

794
01:04:53,900 --> 01:04:56,090
No! You can't!

795
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:58,200
He didn't do anything wrong!

796
01:04:58,310 --> 01:05:01,610
Well, maybe he didn't,
but you did.

797
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:03,740
And because you made
friends with a zombie,

798
01:05:03,850 --> 01:05:07,690
a lot of nice people
in this neighborhood got killed.

799
01:05:07,790 --> 01:05:10,950
You didn't think of that, did you?

800
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,260
Timmy...

801
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:20,320
do you know that I could
send you and your whole family

802
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:24,170
to the Wild Zone
for what you've done?

803
01:05:24,270 --> 01:05:27,330
How do you think
I got the Johnson place?

804
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:30,380
But I had a nice talk
with your parents,

805
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:33,510
and they assured me that nothing like this
would ever happen again.

806
01:05:33,620 --> 01:05:35,410
Isn't that right, Helen?

807
01:05:38,620 --> 01:05:40,090
Go to your room.

808
01:05:40,190 --> 01:05:42,020
Now.

809
01:05:48,460 --> 01:05:50,950
Yes, sir.

810
01:05:51,070 --> 01:05:55,100
These little problems are
all about containment.

811
01:06:57,890 --> 01:07:00,910
And Floyd hits this big slice into
the clubhouse,

812
01:07:01,020 --> 01:07:04,360
and the ball hits old man Patterson
right between the eyes.

813
01:07:04,460 --> 01:07:07,260
I thought we were gonna have
our first zombie golfer.

814
01:07:17,770 --> 01:07:22,540
How come they blame the bullies
for Mrs. Henderson getting killed?

815
01:07:25,450 --> 01:07:28,080
Well, we're just lucky to have a neighbor
like Mr. Bottoms.

816
01:07:28,180 --> 01:07:30,480
Your mother is right, Tim.

817
01:07:30,590 --> 01:07:32,180
But Fido had to die.

818
01:07:32,290 --> 01:07:34,410
The bullies got blamed
for it anyways.

819
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:36,920
Mom killed the bullies
and didn't tell anyone.

820
01:07:37,030 --> 01:07:40,200
How come she didn't
get in trouble?

821
01:07:42,110 --> 01:07:45,740
Why-- Why are we
talking about this?

822
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:49,870
I thought we agreed we weren't gonna have
to talk about this!

823
01:07:49,980 --> 01:07:51,970
Bill, where are you going?

824
01:08:01,130 --> 01:08:03,750
I loved Fido, too, you know.

825
01:08:03,860 --> 01:08:05,850
- You did?
- Yeah.

826
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:08,260
Well...

827
01:08:08,370 --> 01:08:10,430
in a way I did.

828
01:08:10,540 --> 01:08:13,060
Like Mr. Theopolis loves Tammy?

829
01:08:13,170 --> 01:08:14,930
No, he does not.

830
01:08:16,410 --> 01:08:19,470
Like a friend, Timmy.

831
01:08:19,580 --> 01:08:21,550
Just like that.

832
01:08:26,620 --> 01:08:31,260
You see, Timmy, the thing
about your dad...

833
01:08:31,370 --> 01:08:36,860
is that he is still
a part of this family.

834
01:08:36,970 --> 01:08:38,670
He is?

835
01:08:38,770 --> 01:08:42,470
Of course he is.

836
01:08:42,580 --> 01:08:46,040
Why would you say
something like that?

837
01:08:46,150 --> 01:08:48,580
I think he loves us.

838
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:50,710
I do.

839
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:54,580
I just think that
he's afraid to admit it.

840
01:08:58,330 --> 01:09:01,630
Dad, you just
passed the school.

841
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:04,530
Oh.

842
01:09:04,630 --> 01:09:06,600
So I did.

843
01:09:10,970 --> 01:09:12,230
Bye, Dad.

844
01:09:12,340 --> 01:09:14,600
Uh, Timmy...

845
01:09:14,710 --> 01:09:16,180
uh...

846
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:19,270
Look, l-- I know it's hard.

847
01:09:22,180 --> 01:09:23,480
I understand.

848
01:09:23,590 --> 01:09:25,060
You do?

849
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:26,530
Sure I do.

850
01:09:26,630 --> 01:09:30,090
Look, son...

851
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:32,470
I know when you're a kid,
you feel things.

852
01:09:32,570 --> 01:09:34,870
A lot of...

853
01:09:34,970 --> 01:09:36,460
things.

854
01:09:36,580 --> 01:09:38,770
But you have to get over that.

855
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:39,900
Get over what?

856
01:09:40,010 --> 01:09:41,540
Feelings.

857
01:09:42,410 --> 01:09:44,510
Feelings.

858
01:09:44,620 --> 01:09:47,450
Not important, okay?

859
01:09:47,550 --> 01:09:51,350
Being alive is what counts.

860
01:09:52,790 --> 01:09:54,690
Wait a minute. I got something.

861
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:02,960
Go on. Open it.

862
01:10:08,070 --> 01:10:10,170
- It's a gun.
- Take it out.

863
01:10:18,430 --> 01:10:21,090
I know you're not supposed to have
a handgun...

864
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:23,460
until you're 12...

865
01:10:23,570 --> 01:10:27,230
but it can come in real handy.

866
01:10:27,340 --> 01:10:30,030
What do you say?

867
01:10:30,140 --> 01:10:32,230
Thanks, Dad.

868
01:10:32,340 --> 01:10:34,830
This will just be between us.

869
01:10:34,940 --> 01:10:37,640
Keep it in your book bag.

870
01:10:37,750 --> 01:10:39,870
Don't forget the bullets.

871
01:10:44,950 --> 01:10:46,420
There you go.

872
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:50,890
Have a good day, Tim.

873
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:54,900
Bye, Dad.

874
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:11,280
Bill?

875
01:11:13,020 --> 01:11:17,090
Do you think we did the right thing
sending Fido back?

876
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:21,330
I had a great chat with Tim today.

877
01:11:21,430 --> 01:11:24,870
I think everything is
gonna be just fine.

878
01:11:24,970 --> 01:11:26,440
Really?

879
01:11:26,540 --> 01:11:28,730
Absolutely.

880
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:42,580
Bill, do you love me?

881
01:11:52,030 --> 01:11:53,430
I'm pregnant.

882
01:11:54,870 --> 01:11:56,300
Oh.

883
01:11:57,900 --> 01:12:01,860
I'm sure it's nothing.
You're just gaining a little weight.

884
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:10,720
Helen.

885
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:17,430
I just don't think on my salary
I can afford another funeral.

886
01:12:39,820 --> 01:12:42,950
- Are you sure?
- I heard Daddy on the phone.

887
01:12:43,060 --> 01:12:45,580
He said he never wastes
a good zombie.

888
01:12:45,690 --> 01:12:47,820
He's got him working the factory.

889
01:12:47,930 --> 01:12:49,830
Can you get us in there?

890
01:12:49,930 --> 01:12:52,400
Are you crazy?
My dad would kill me.

891
01:12:53,940 --> 01:12:56,130
No, I mean he really would kill me.

892
01:13:00,350 --> 01:13:02,380
But I know someone who can.

893
01:13:13,100 --> 01:13:16,190
Not the teeth, baby.
Good girl.

894
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:19,200
Mr. Theopolis?

895
01:13:19,300 --> 01:13:20,830
Yeah.

896
01:13:20,940 --> 01:13:22,340
Is Tammy your girlfriend?

897
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:24,840
What do you mean?

898
01:13:24,940 --> 01:13:27,280
Cindy says that she's your girlfriend,

899
01:13:27,380 --> 01:13:31,650
and you got fired from Zomcon
for having a zombie girlfriend.

900
01:13:31,750 --> 01:13:33,120
She said that?

901
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:37,350
Aren't you worried
they'll take her away?

902
01:13:37,460 --> 01:13:39,050
Nah.

903
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:41,680
I'll just get me another one,
the same vintage.

904
01:13:43,060 --> 01:13:45,120
Hey, I'm kidding.

905
01:13:47,930 --> 01:13:49,630
I went and hurt her feelings.

906
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:56,870
So, you clear on the plan?

907
01:13:56,990 --> 01:13:58,540
Yeah.

908
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:08,960
- Theopolis.
- Hi, Frank.

909
01:14:09,060 --> 01:14:10,590
What are you doing back here?

910
01:14:10,700 --> 01:14:13,760
Oh, you know, just bringing the old unit
in for a tune-up.

911
01:14:17,740 --> 01:14:21,270
It's, um...Tammy.

912
01:14:21,380 --> 01:14:23,840
- Right?
- That's right. Tammy.

913
01:14:26,580 --> 01:14:27,840
So...

914
01:14:31,550 --> 01:14:34,490
Okay, go ahead.

915
01:14:34,590 --> 01:14:35,850
Thanks, Frank.

916
01:14:42,430 --> 01:14:44,340
Timmy!

917
01:14:54,850 --> 01:14:56,380
Bill!

918
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:01,820
If Timmy hadn't broken
the rules in the first place,

919
01:15:01,930 --> 01:15:03,260
none of this would have happened.

920
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:05,420
He messed up, not me.

921
01:15:09,100 --> 01:15:11,160
I suppose you think he got so attached
to the damned thing

922
01:15:11,270 --> 01:15:13,460
because I'm a bad father.

923
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:20,770
I'd say I'm a pretty
darn good father.

924
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:22,370
My father tried to eat me.

925
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:24,510
I don't remember trying to eat Timmy.

926
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:29,320
Bill, just because your father
tried to eat you,

927
01:15:29,420 --> 01:15:32,220
does that mean we all have to be
unhappy...

928
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:33,980
forever?

929
01:15:37,060 --> 01:15:40,130
Welcome to Zomcon's
returns department.

930
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:44,010
Please... stay with your zombie
at all times,

931
01:15:44,110 --> 01:15:47,140
maintain an orderly line
between the railings,

932
01:15:47,250 --> 01:15:50,010
and use our conveniently
placed safety buttons...

933
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:51,610
Come on.

934
01:15:53,590 --> 01:15:55,280
- Are you all right, Mr. Theopolis?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

935
01:15:56,720 --> 01:15:59,750
Now, the door into the factory
is right behind the clerk.

936
01:15:59,860 --> 01:16:02,420
Are you ready?

937
01:16:07,170 --> 01:16:09,230
All right.

938
01:16:13,070 --> 01:16:14,870
Honey...

939
01:16:14,980 --> 01:16:16,670
I'm gonna be gone
for a little while,

940
01:16:16,780 --> 01:16:19,250
and then I'm gonna
come back, all right?

941
01:16:19,350 --> 01:16:21,250
You stay here.

942
01:16:30,830 --> 01:16:33,700
All right. Let's do this.

943
01:16:39,080 --> 01:16:42,310
Wild zombie! Wild zombie!

944
01:17:02,730 --> 01:17:05,500
That's my Tammy.

945
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:09,440
You-- You knucklehead!

946
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:14,870
Fido?

947
01:17:18,380 --> 01:17:21,050
All right, seal off the returns room...

948
01:17:21,150 --> 01:17:23,750
and shut off that damned alarm.

949
01:17:27,770 --> 01:17:30,570
You naughty little boy.

950
01:17:31,970 --> 01:17:33,840
No, not you.
I'll call you back.

951
01:17:43,650 --> 01:17:45,350
Fido?

952
01:17:46,790 --> 01:17:48,150
Fido?

953
01:17:55,100 --> 01:17:56,090
Fido!

954
01:17:57,700 --> 01:17:59,190
I'll be right down!

955
01:18:00,900 --> 01:18:02,800
Hello, Timmy.

956
01:18:02,900 --> 01:18:03,870
No!

957
01:18:18,700 --> 01:18:20,530
Turn the car around.

958
01:18:20,630 --> 01:18:22,220
We need to keep the road clear.

959
01:18:22,330 --> 01:18:23,770
Of course, Frank.

960
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:40,010
- What's happening here?
- I'll call it in!

961
01:18:44,790 --> 01:18:47,350
This way! This way!

962
01:18:49,460 --> 01:18:50,650
Timmy!

963
01:18:52,860 --> 01:18:54,350
Bill, give me that gun.
I'm going in.

964
01:18:54,470 --> 01:18:55,990
You stay here
in case Timmy shows up.

965
01:18:56,100 --> 01:18:58,760
No, l-- I want to.

966
01:18:58,870 --> 01:19:00,860
Bill, give me the shotgun.

967
01:19:00,970 --> 01:19:02,440
I am a good father.

968
01:19:04,780 --> 01:19:05,740
Bill!

969
01:19:07,550 --> 01:19:10,540
Remember, Helen...
head coffin.

970
01:19:22,040 --> 01:19:24,900
- I just wanna show you something.
- You can't make me go!

971
01:19:25,010 --> 01:19:26,470
- Come on!
- No!

972
01:19:26,570 --> 01:19:29,670
Now...take a look,
all right?

973
01:19:29,780 --> 01:19:32,770
Out there is chaos.

974
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:35,870
And in here is safety.

975
01:19:35,980 --> 01:19:39,080
People who don't understand that

976
01:19:39,190 --> 01:19:41,520
end up on the wrong side
of the fence.

977
01:19:41,620 --> 01:19:43,350
Now go on and make yourself
some friends.

978
01:19:43,460 --> 01:19:45,050
No! No!

979
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:47,150
Let me out! Please!

980
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:05,480
Stay away from me.

981
01:20:06,790 --> 01:20:08,820
Come on, Robinson.

982
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:13,720
All right. All right.

983
01:20:24,010 --> 01:20:25,410
Fido, it's you.

984
01:20:25,510 --> 01:20:27,600
Where's Timmy Boy?

985
01:20:27,710 --> 01:20:31,010
They're not particularly fast,
are they?

986
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:32,080
Fido!

987
01:20:34,520 --> 01:20:35,610
Dad!

988
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:37,150
Robinson?

989
01:20:37,260 --> 01:20:41,160
I'd like you to let my son
back inside the gate now, please.

990
01:20:41,260 --> 01:20:42,230
I don't think so.

991
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:48,660
Now you be quiet!

992
01:20:59,950 --> 01:21:00,920
Help!

993
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:14,390
Leave him alone!

994
01:21:18,670 --> 01:21:19,900
Dad!

995
01:21:30,420 --> 01:21:32,050
Get him, boy!

996
01:21:42,530 --> 01:21:44,690
Fido! Behind you!

997
01:21:54,550 --> 01:21:56,110
Mom!

998
01:21:56,220 --> 01:21:57,380
Where's your father?

999
01:22:17,170 --> 01:22:18,440
Get in.

1000
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:26,850
See you later, Frank.

1001
01:22:28,890 --> 01:22:31,220
My God.

1002
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:54,290
Zomcon forces spent
Saturday afternoon

1003
01:22:54,390 --> 01:22:56,150
securing a Wild Zone breach

1004
01:22:56,260 --> 01:22:59,720
within Willard's own
Zomcon Containment Center.

1005
01:22:59,830 --> 01:23:01,490
Human casualties were low,

1006
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:06,230
but the nation mourns one of its greatest
and most respected war heroes.

1007
01:23:06,330 --> 01:23:09,390
Zomcon Chief John Bottoms
died valiantly

1008
01:23:09,500 --> 01:23:10,990
while defending
the people of Willard

1009
01:23:11,110 --> 01:23:14,630
from a wild zombie outbreak
caused by this man...

1010
01:23:14,740 --> 01:23:16,040
Frank Murphy,

1011
01:23:16,140 --> 01:23:18,630
a once-trusted Zomcon
security guard,

1012
01:23:18,750 --> 01:23:20,370
who was caught accepting bribes

1013
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:22,950
from a renegade group
of wild zombie poachers.

1014
01:23:28,290 --> 01:23:29,480
Are you ready, dear?

1015
01:23:36,860 --> 01:23:39,140
Head coffin, please.

1016
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:48,950
Bill Robinson...

1017
01:23:49,050 --> 01:23:52,890
from dust have you come,
and to dust shall you return.

1018
01:23:52,990 --> 01:23:56,120
But from dust shall you not be
resurrected.

1019
01:24:00,130 --> 01:24:02,600
It's what he always wanted.

1020
01:24:11,580 --> 01:24:13,940
Okay, Tammy,
just what you ordered.

1021
01:24:16,810 --> 01:24:19,540
Now don't you move a muscle.

1022
01:24:19,650 --> 01:24:22,140
There's only one Tammy
in the world, right?

1023
01:24:40,780 --> 01:24:42,650
Nice catch!

1024
01:24:47,390 --> 01:24:49,190
Hi, Timmy. Hi, Fido.

1025
01:24:52,430 --> 01:24:53,830
Hi, Timmy.

1026
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:57,020
Surprised?

1027
01:24:57,130 --> 01:24:59,030
Sort of.

1028
01:24:59,130 --> 01:25:01,570
It's okay.
He's so cool in a way.

1029
01:25:01,670 --> 01:25:03,300
And he's a lot nicer.

1030
01:25:05,570 --> 01:25:08,240
- Do you wanna play catch?
- Sure.

1031
01:25:08,340 --> 01:25:10,540
Does, uh, your zombie
wanna play?

1032
01:25:13,610 --> 01:25:15,780
What do you call him, anyways?

1033
01:25:15,880 --> 01:25:17,410
I don't know.

1034
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:19,280
Right now I'm just calling him Daddy.

1035
01:25:19,390 --> 01:25:21,850
Sure. Okay.

1036
01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:23,890
Come on.

1037
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:25,870
Come on, Daddy.
