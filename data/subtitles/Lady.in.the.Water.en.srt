1
00:00:27,856 --> 00:00:34,024
<i>Once, man and those in the water</i>
<i>were linked.</i>

2
00:00:34,195 --> 00:00:36,484
<i>They inspired us.</i>

3
00:00:36,655 --> 00:00:38,898
<i>They spoke of the future.</i>

4
00:00:39,075 --> 00:00:43,820
<i>Man listened and it became real.</i>

5
00:00:44,412 --> 00:00:48,328
<i>But man does not listen very well.</i>

6
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:54,335
<i>Man's need to own everything</i>
<i>led him deeper into land.</i>

7
00:00:54,506 --> 00:00:57,959
<i>The magic world of the ones</i>
<i>that live in the ocean...</i>

8
00:00:58,134 --> 00:01:00,506
<i>... and the world of men...</i>

9
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:02,921
<i>... separated.</i>

10
00:01:03,099 --> 00:01:07,393
<i>Through the centuries, their world,</i>
<i>and all the inhabitants of it...</i>

11
00:01:07,561 --> 00:01:09,519
<i>... stopped trying.</i>

12
00:01:10,689 --> 00:01:13,807
<i>The world of man became more violent.</i>

13
00:01:13,983 --> 00:01:19,856
<i>War upon war played out,</i>
<i>as there were no guides to listen to.</i>

14
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:25,203
<i>Now those in the water</i>
<i>are trying again...</i>

15
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:27,990
<i>... trying to reach us.</i>

16
00:01:28,164 --> 00:01:33,121
<i>A handful of their precious young ones</i>
<i>have been sent into the world of man.</i>

17
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:35,998
<i>They are brought in the dead of night...</i>

18
00:01:36,171 --> 00:01:39,506
<i>... to where man lives.</i>

19
00:01:39,676 --> 00:01:42,545
<i>They need only be glimpsed...</i>

20
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:46,504
<i>... and the awakening of man</i>
<i>will happen.</i>

21
00:01:46,682 --> 00:01:50,051
<i>But their enemies roam the land.</i>

22
00:01:50,228 --> 00:01:53,727
<i>There are laws that are meant</i>
<i>to keep the young ones safe...</i>

23
00:01:53,897 --> 00:01:57,811
<i>... but they are sent</i>
<i>at great risk to their lives.</i>

24
00:01:57,985 --> 00:01:59,777
<i>Many...</i>

25
00:01:59,945 --> 00:02:01,984
<i>... do not return.</i>

26
00:02:05,075 --> 00:02:07,697
<i>Yet still they try...</i>

27
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:10,906
<i>... try to help man.</i>

28
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:17,829
<i>But man may have</i>
<i>forgotten how to listen.</i>

29
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:37,603
My daughter says to be careful,
Mr. Heep.

30
00:02:42,111 --> 00:02:46,439
Well, it's some kind
of a b... B... B... Bug.

31
00:02:46,615 --> 00:02:48,609
It's very big.

32
00:02:49,411 --> 00:02:51,367
It's very hairy.

33
00:02:55,540 --> 00:03:00,453
My other daughter says it's
some kind of creature the devil made.

34
00:03:00,629 --> 00:03:01,959
Tell her it's not a creature.

35
00:03:02,132 --> 00:03:05,334
There's no such thing as creatures,
all right?

36
00:03:05,843 --> 00:03:07,123
You...

37
00:03:07,302 --> 00:03:09,840
You might wanna turn away.

38
00:03:23,151 --> 00:03:26,151
Sorry this is taking so long.

39
00:03:39,502 --> 00:03:41,990
It's over. It's over.

40
00:03:42,295 --> 00:03:44,998
It's... It's safe.

41
00:03:51,012 --> 00:03:56,137
My daughter says
thank you for protecting them.

42
00:04:01,396 --> 00:04:02,938
Mr. Farber?

43
00:04:03,106 --> 00:04:06,025
I'm Cleveland Heep.
Welcome to the Cove.

44
00:04:06,443 --> 00:04:08,435
Mr. Heep!

45
00:04:14,492 --> 00:04:15,739
You are new tenant?

46
00:04:15,912 --> 00:04:19,446
Yeah, this is Mr. Farber. He's in 13B.

47
00:04:19,622 --> 00:04:23,074
Now, Mr. Farber, this is Young-Soon
Choi. She lives with her mother in 8A.

48
00:04:23,252 --> 00:04:26,620
She's a student at the university.

49
00:04:27,213 --> 00:04:29,502
Young-Soon, you don't know...

50
00:04:29,673 --> 00:04:33,423
...who's been swimming in the pool
the last few nights, do you?

51
00:04:33,595 --> 00:04:35,884
No, Mr. Heep.

52
00:04:36,555 --> 00:04:39,261
By the way, here. Thanks. I liked it.

53
00:04:39,435 --> 00:04:41,057
You're welcome.

54
00:04:41,226 --> 00:04:45,475
Mr. Heep loves learning.
He doesn't want people to know.

55
00:04:46,066 --> 00:04:50,726
Mr. Heep, pool man looking for you.
I tell him you come soon.

56
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:55,271
Could you wait here just a moment,
please?

57
00:04:55,699 --> 00:04:58,903
Gonna ask something. Answer straight.
You guys having parties in here?

58
00:04:59,077 --> 00:05:01,451
Bubble parties, bubble bath,
everyone skinny-dipping?

59
00:05:01,622 --> 00:05:02,867
No.

60
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,244
- Those bubbles make the water very slick.
- No.

61
00:05:07,586 --> 00:05:11,880
I'll trust you on that. But something
is making this water like this.

62
00:05:12,048 --> 00:05:15,750
There has been someone
swimming at nighttime.

63
00:05:15,927 --> 00:05:20,755
I hear sp... Sp... Sp...
Splashing some nights.

64
00:05:21,684 --> 00:05:24,934
I left here yesterday afternoon,
this filter was empty.

65
00:05:33,778 --> 00:05:37,528
You kind of look like maybe
you could work out a little bit, right?

66
00:05:38,449 --> 00:05:40,276
I could give you a vein like that.

67
00:05:40,451 --> 00:05:44,117
I could make it look just like this. Right?

68
00:05:44,956 --> 00:05:47,115
Most people say,
"What's wrong with you, Reggie?

69
00:05:47,292 --> 00:05:50,125
Why you only working out
on one side of your body?"

70
00:05:50,295 --> 00:05:54,956
I tell them it's like an experiment.
I'm like a scientist.

71
00:05:59,552 --> 00:06:03,336
This morning I measured my bicep.

72
00:06:04,641 --> 00:06:07,762
Four-and-a-half-inch difference
from one side to the other.

73
00:06:07,937 --> 00:06:09,514
Look at that.

74
00:06:09,687 --> 00:06:11,976
Take a guess at the difference
between my thighs.

75
00:06:12,483 --> 00:06:13,858
- Hello, Reggie.
- Hey.

76
00:06:14,026 --> 00:06:16,481
- Hey. Sorry.
- Hey.

77
00:06:16,778 --> 00:06:19,447
Me and the new guy,
we're talking science.

78
00:06:19,613 --> 00:06:22,235
Okay, that's great. Here we go, Mr. F...

79
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:24,735
Here we go. Come on.

80
00:06:26,622 --> 00:06:30,322
Don't hang out in the stairwell,
Reggie, please.

81
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,788
- Okay.
- All right.

82
00:06:32,961 --> 00:06:37,338
Just... People might trip.

83
00:06:37,507 --> 00:06:38,538
All right.

84
00:06:38,716 --> 00:06:41,670
Reggie's harmless.
He just wants to be special.

85
00:06:41,845 --> 00:06:44,086
He's working out
only one side of his body.

86
00:06:44,264 --> 00:06:47,016
Did he...? Did he tell you that?

87
00:06:47,183 --> 00:06:49,055
<i>- Be inside within minutes.</i>

88
00:06:49,226 --> 00:06:50,471
Hello, Mr. Leeds.

89
00:06:50,644 --> 00:06:54,346
<i>Those soldiers are only now beginning to</i>
<i>wonder how long they'll end up staying.</i>

90
00:06:54,524 --> 00:06:58,473
<i>If this does come to combat, we will not</i>
<i>be in the battle for the sake of the battle.</i>

91
00:06:58,653 --> 00:07:00,230
He's been here f... F... Forever.

92
00:07:00,403 --> 00:07:02,812
<i>- Will not be reached any other way.</i>

93
00:07:04,201 --> 00:07:08,944
Mrs. Bell, she takes in animals.
Smart lady. You'd like her.

94
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,160
- He... Not just because he died.
- There's a bunch of people better.

95
00:07:15,336 --> 00:07:17,826
- Name four people better.
- Name one better than Fred.

96
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:22,418
Axl Rose. Sebastian Bach.
Bret Michaels is better than he is.

97
00:07:22,593 --> 00:07:25,548
Bret Michaels.
I'd rather listen to Bon... Jon Bon Jovi.

98
00:07:25,721 --> 00:07:26,882
What? Are you...?

99
00:07:27,055 --> 00:07:28,716
This is you.

100
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:37,557
There's no smoking inside.

101
00:07:38,358 --> 00:07:42,356
And there's no swimming after 7.

102
00:07:45,408 --> 00:07:50,317
I hope it's okay to ask: What brings you
here from the West Coast, Mr. Farber?

103
00:07:50,495 --> 00:07:53,661
I've been hired to be the local film
and book critic for the paper.

104
00:07:53,831 --> 00:07:55,824
They flew you all the way
out here for that?

105
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,329
- They did.
- Well, you must be very good.

106
00:08:19,148 --> 00:08:21,057
<i>Mr. Heep, Betty Pen again.</i>

107
00:08:21,233 --> 00:08:25,231
<i>I smell something awful</i>
<i>coming from the upstairs apartment.</i>

108
00:08:25,403 --> 00:08:30,646
<i>I think someone may have died</i>
<i>and the body is decomposing.</i>

109
00:08:30,826 --> 00:08:34,195
<i>I know I said this last week, but...</i>

110
00:08:44,923 --> 00:08:48,456
<i>Not everyone here</i>
<i>spent Sunday practicing for war.</i>

111
00:08:48,634 --> 00:08:52,678
<i>At Sunday church services,</i>
<i>chaplains rallied the troops.</i>

112
00:08:52,846 --> 00:08:55,384
<i>For these Marines,</i>
<i>a moment for prayer...</i>

113
00:08:55,557 --> 00:09:01,144
<i>... at a service that many here believe</i>
<i>will be their last before going to war.</i>

114
00:09:02,649 --> 00:09:06,480
<i>U.S. Forces predicted today the enemy,</i>
<i>estimated at 3 to 4000...</i>

115
00:09:06,652 --> 00:09:08,312
<i>... may be willing...</i>

116
00:09:15,076 --> 00:09:17,403
<i>- a major... A major confrontation.</i>

117
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:22,323
<i>At the same time, the U.S. Military</i>
<i>will be fighting a propaganda war.</i>

118
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:26,332
<i>If there were a silver bullet,</i>
<i>we would've shot that a long time ago.</i>

119
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,769
Hey! I saw you!

120
00:10:30,942 --> 00:10:33,066
I saw you!

121
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:40,409
Come out of that pool right now!

122
00:10:41,577 --> 00:10:43,120
Hey!

123
00:10:46,584 --> 00:10:48,292
I'm gonna wait.

124
00:10:52,129 --> 00:10:53,672
Hey.

125
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,760
Hey.

126
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:06,515
Come on out, now. It's...

127
00:11:07,769 --> 00:11:10,225
It's... It's not safe.

128
00:11:12,817 --> 00:11:15,522
Come on out. This is not f...

129
00:11:16,278 --> 00:11:18,355
This is not funny.

130
00:11:24,578 --> 00:11:26,570
Please sto...

131
00:11:54,982 --> 00:11:56,691
God.

132
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:04,837
Did you pull me out?

133
00:13:12,393 --> 00:13:14,100
Where are you from?

134
00:13:14,394 --> 00:13:16,552
The Blue World.

135
00:13:16,812 --> 00:13:19,054
Is that an apartment?

136
00:13:20,315 --> 00:13:22,937
Do you feel an awakening?

137
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:25,562
I'm sorry?

138
00:13:25,739 --> 00:13:29,188
It will feel like pins and needles...

139
00:13:29,866 --> 00:13:31,775
...inside.

140
00:13:35,789 --> 00:13:37,912
It is not you.

141
00:13:44,548 --> 00:13:46,172
It's late.

142
00:13:46,966 --> 00:13:48,711
You really...

143
00:13:51,388 --> 00:13:53,594
You shouldn't be here.

144
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:58,470
I'm kind of old-fashioned that way.
I don't even know your name.

145
00:13:58,644 --> 00:14:00,352
My name is Story.

146
00:14:00,522 --> 00:14:02,679
I didn't mean for you to tell...

147
00:14:08,488 --> 00:14:10,480
Why am I not stuttering?

148
00:14:10,655 --> 00:14:12,115
What?

149
00:14:18,498 --> 00:14:21,368
Hello, Story, my name is Cleveland.

150
00:14:21,543 --> 00:14:23,499
"From the cliffs."

151
00:14:23,961 --> 00:14:26,630
That is what your name means.

152
00:14:26,797 --> 00:14:28,624
Where did you learn that?

153
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:30,708
From my studies.

154
00:14:32,802 --> 00:14:38,010
I promise that I will not
get you into trouble. You can go.

155
00:14:39,809 --> 00:14:41,967
I am scared.

156
00:14:43,312 --> 00:14:46,515
I will wait here with you, Cleveland.

157
00:14:47,567 --> 00:14:49,559
Why are you scared?

158
00:15:02,456 --> 00:15:05,706
You can wait here for a little bit...

159
00:15:05,876 --> 00:15:08,499
...until you feel not so scared.

160
00:15:12,676 --> 00:15:14,501
Are you okay?

161
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:24,471
Oh, my God. You're just a kid.

162
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,081
Hello.

163
00:15:56,177 --> 00:16:01,418
Okay. It's time to go. Story, come on.

164
00:16:09,605 --> 00:16:11,100
Okay.

165
00:16:11,274 --> 00:16:13,811
I think you need some fresh air.

166
00:16:14,693 --> 00:16:16,153
I'm just gonna take you outside.

167
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,609
I'm gonna put you
on one of the pool chairs.

168
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:21,153
I'm gonna get you some coffee...

169
00:16:21,325 --> 00:16:23,567
...and then you can wake up.

170
00:16:24,913 --> 00:16:27,153
Then I'll walk you home.

171
00:16:35,506 --> 00:16:38,755
Tell me, who in the world
are you, anyway?

172
00:16:40,052 --> 00:16:43,336
- Narf.
- What?

173
00:16:49,102 --> 00:16:51,142
Okay. Come on.

174
00:16:51,605 --> 00:16:53,182
Here we go.

175
00:17:05,618 --> 00:17:07,160
Okay.

176
00:18:23,194 --> 00:18:29,066
It was sort of h... H... Hairy, but...
But matted, like clumps. You know?

177
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:31,945
And it was kind of g... Green.

178
00:18:32,118 --> 00:18:34,076
- You say green?
- Yeah.

179
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:37,746
I thought so. Matted is... Is not right.

180
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:43,255
It was f... F... Flat, and...
And thicker than hair.

181
00:18:44,548 --> 00:18:48,759
Like this. Like this.
Flat and this kind of a color.

182
00:18:48,926 --> 00:18:54,217
- And... Is this not helping you at all?
- Forget about its hair for a second.

183
00:18:54,391 --> 00:18:58,223
It's obviously some dumb animal
who muddied himself. About how tall?

184
00:18:58,394 --> 00:19:00,968
- What, was it a Great Dane?
- No, no, no. No, sir.

185
00:19:01,146 --> 00:19:05,145
I mean, are there any w... W...
Wolves in this area? Hyenas?

186
00:19:05,318 --> 00:19:08,853
Jack, this is Philadelphia.
Where do you think you're living?

187
00:19:11,574 --> 00:19:14,741
Sorry. Something keeps
setting off the sprinklers.

188
00:19:14,911 --> 00:19:18,113
I'll look around the forest and check
behind the dumpsters and stuff.

189
00:19:18,288 --> 00:19:20,531
An animal that size,
the one you're describing...

190
00:19:20,709 --> 00:19:22,500
...doesn't walk around and not be seen.

191
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:25,420
There's nowhere for
a dumb big animal to hide.

192
00:19:35,932 --> 00:19:36,962
Cleveland.

193
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:38,115
Hey.

194
00:20:38,826 --> 00:20:40,653
Got a lot of homework, huh?

195
00:20:40,828 --> 00:20:43,318
University gives many pages of reading.

196
00:20:43,497 --> 00:20:46,332
What they think, I have no social life?

197
00:20:47,335 --> 00:20:49,326
I got more books for you.

198
00:20:49,502 --> 00:20:53,452
Could you look up
the word "narf" for me?

199
00:20:54,467 --> 00:20:58,298
It's an Eastern bedtime story, Mr. Heep.

200
00:20:58,471 --> 00:20:59,669
I do not remember it.

201
00:20:59,846 --> 00:21:02,800
My great-grandmother
used to tell it when she was alive.

202
00:21:02,973 --> 00:21:05,512
A b... B... B...

203
00:21:06,603 --> 00:21:08,845
Bedtime story?

204
00:21:09,021 --> 00:21:10,931
What's the story?

205
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:14,142
I do not remember.

206
00:21:16,363 --> 00:21:18,355
How about your mother?

207
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:32,828
Hello, Mrs. Choi. Hello.

208
00:21:39,219 --> 00:21:41,461
She wants to know
who told you this word.

209
00:21:41,636 --> 00:21:46,215
Oh, j... Just a friend. I don't...
I don't... I don't know her very well.

210
00:21:50,145 --> 00:21:52,767
She said that her grandmother...

211
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:59,059
...used to tell this story like a prayer.
Like it was true.

212
00:22:00,198 --> 00:22:05,867
She said that she knew someone
who knew someone who saw one.

213
00:22:06,036 --> 00:22:07,826
Saw one what?

214
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:16,205
A narf, the bedtime story says,
is a sea nymph.

215
00:22:19,465 --> 00:22:23,298
I s... What...
What happens in the story, please?

216
00:22:31,228 --> 00:22:33,267
No. Mrs...

217
00:22:41,612 --> 00:22:43,022
In the bedtime story...

218
00:22:44,699 --> 00:22:48,614
...she must be seen
by the one human chosen for her.

219
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:57,786
This person is called the vessel.

220
00:22:57,961 --> 00:23:03,038
Seeing the narf will awaken something
in the chosen one.

221
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:06,134
If she's successful in this...

222
00:23:07,762 --> 00:23:13,386
...she will return with the Great Eatlon,
a giant eagle...

223
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,968
...and become free.

224
00:23:17,355 --> 00:23:19,596
She won't tell me more.

225
00:23:19,775 --> 00:23:23,688
She said, why can't I be like
my older sister. She married a dentist.

226
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,833
Story?

227
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:43,663
Story?

228
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:48,336
Cleveland.

229
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:57,266
Story, could you
put something back on, please?

230
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:13,694
Are you here to meet someone,
see someone in this building?

231
00:24:17,705 --> 00:24:21,075
Is somebody supposed to see you?

232
00:24:25,756 --> 00:24:26,869
Is...?

233
00:24:30,134 --> 00:24:31,250
I...

234
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:38,556
It is a writer.

235
00:24:45,065 --> 00:24:47,105
Do you know his name?

236
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,569
Do you know what he looks like?

237
00:24:58,161 --> 00:25:02,111
Do you know if it's a...?
A woman or a man?

238
00:25:06,878 --> 00:25:09,713
Is there something
that you wanna tell me?

239
00:25:16,055 --> 00:25:20,799
Is this person
writing something important?

240
00:25:27,647 --> 00:25:29,605
When do you have to leave?

241
00:25:29,776 --> 00:25:33,690
I can leave tonight if I meet this person.

242
00:25:33,863 --> 00:25:36,152
I'm gonna help you get home.

243
00:25:37,241 --> 00:25:39,614
Thank you, Cleveland.

244
00:25:43,707 --> 00:25:45,532
I have to go.

245
00:25:51,005 --> 00:25:53,578
Hello. I... I...

246
00:25:54,133 --> 00:25:56,257
I wanted to ask you
something about your work.

247
00:25:56,426 --> 00:25:59,843
Your c... C... Critic work.

248
00:26:00,013 --> 00:26:03,798
How's it... How's... How's...
How's it going?

249
00:26:03,976 --> 00:26:08,886
I'm seeing a romance film tonight.
Not my cup of tea.

250
00:26:09,065 --> 00:26:11,603
So you... You...
You haven't written anything yet?

251
00:26:11,775 --> 00:26:13,603
Haven't written anything
for some time.

252
00:26:14,111 --> 00:26:16,683
You were right about that one tenant.

253
00:26:16,864 --> 00:26:18,987
I spoke with Mrs. Bell.

254
00:26:19,157 --> 00:26:22,904
We got along.
She's very good with animals.

255
00:26:23,994 --> 00:26:26,070
You know she wrote a book?

256
00:26:27,373 --> 00:26:31,241
Mr. Heep,
I will be taking the cat in directly.

257
00:26:31,795 --> 00:26:33,454
Don't worry, Mrs. Bell.

258
00:26:36,798 --> 00:26:38,507
Lookie here.

259
00:26:40,345 --> 00:26:44,009
My, there's a lot of butterflies
around this building.

260
00:26:44,974 --> 00:26:49,682
Strange behavior for them.
They're not usually so trusting.

261
00:26:51,439 --> 00:26:56,147
I understand that you're a writer,
Mrs. Bell.

262
00:26:56,318 --> 00:26:57,896
Now, where'd you hear such things?

263
00:26:58,695 --> 00:27:04,651
Maybe I read your book.

264
00:27:04,827 --> 00:27:08,611
That'd be quite a trick.
It's been out of print for 20 years.

265
00:27:08,788 --> 00:27:12,240
Twenty years?
So you haven't written anything recently?

266
00:27:12,417 --> 00:27:15,952
Mr. Farber has been speaking
out of turn.

267
00:27:19,382 --> 00:27:21,375
Look at this cereal character's picture,
Dad.

268
00:27:21,551 --> 00:27:25,798
Looks like Aunt Sylvia when she found out
everybody hated her fruit-bowl painting.

269
00:27:27,266 --> 00:27:31,642
I need a nine-letter word
for "in human form."

270
00:27:32,394 --> 00:27:34,721
You'll figure it out, Dad.

271
00:27:35,147 --> 00:27:36,726
I...

272
00:27:36,983 --> 00:27:41,443
You know, the color on this box
look just like the colors of your car, Dad.

273
00:27:41,613 --> 00:27:44,150
Maybe we should take your car
and go visit Aunt Sylvia.

274
00:27:44,325 --> 00:27:45,982
Incarnate.

275
00:27:48,451 --> 00:27:52,950
Well, you're very good
with those word puzzles, Mr. Dury.

276
00:27:53,125 --> 00:27:56,659
He's a grand-master level.
I'm gonna be just like him.

277
00:27:56,836 --> 00:27:59,955
- So you like words a lot, huh?
- I adore them.

278
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:03,382
Are you... Are you writing anything,
Mr. Dury?

279
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:05,045
A book, maybe?

280
00:28:05,219 --> 00:28:06,416
No, I...

281
00:28:06,596 --> 00:28:11,423
I'm afraid my skills are limited
to crossword puzzles.

282
00:28:12,934 --> 00:28:15,259
That's some serious reekage, man.

283
00:28:15,436 --> 00:28:18,010
You don't even speak English anymore.

284
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:21,807
What, reekage? Damn straight
it's English. The state of reek.

285
00:28:21,984 --> 00:28:24,227
There's no "reekage," man.

286
00:28:24,403 --> 00:28:29,861
Some toker just like us made it up
somewhere, and here you are speaking it.

287
00:28:30,201 --> 00:28:34,280
Let's make up a witty phrase.
It'll become famous.

288
00:28:34,454 --> 00:28:37,576
It needs to be on some T-shirt
or something, you ass.

289
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:43,088
No, it doesn't. It just catches on.
People just start saying it.

290
00:28:43,256 --> 00:28:45,165
Blim-blam.

291
00:28:45,342 --> 00:28:47,666
What? Blim-blam?

292
00:28:47,844 --> 00:28:49,920
Somebody already said that.

293
00:28:51,972 --> 00:28:55,805
Gentlemen, I don't suppose...

294
00:28:55,977 --> 00:29:00,769
...any of you have written
anything lately.

295
00:29:01,565 --> 00:29:06,144
An essay or something?

296
00:29:07,237 --> 00:29:09,942
Something important?

297
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:11,943
No essays here, my man.

298
00:29:14,036 --> 00:29:18,615
Okay. Stop putting your clothes
in the garbage disposal...

299
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:21,282
...and stop smoking.

300
00:29:28,592 --> 00:29:30,833
Baby's on the half-tip.

301
00:29:33,262 --> 00:29:34,508
- Snap!
- Yeah.

302
00:29:34,681 --> 00:29:37,087
There you go. There you go.

303
00:29:37,433 --> 00:29:38,465
Mr. Heep.

304
00:29:38,644 --> 00:29:41,929
She told me a little bit more of the story
before she throw cushion at me.

305
00:29:42,105 --> 00:29:43,302
Young-Soon.

306
00:29:44,023 --> 00:29:46,941
You're not writing anything, are you?

307
00:29:47,109 --> 00:29:50,608
A p... P... P... Paper, maybe?

308
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:53,270
Writing? No, Mr. Heep.

309
00:29:53,449 --> 00:29:58,740
This semester all multiple-choice
courses. Young-Soon is not stupid.

310
00:30:00,248 --> 00:30:03,497
She told me about a bad guy in story.

311
00:30:03,667 --> 00:30:07,000
These creatures are called scrunts.

312
00:30:07,172 --> 00:30:10,872
They are meant to kill a narf
when she is out of the water.

313
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:13,720
They can lay completely flat.

314
00:30:13,886 --> 00:30:16,589
Their back is covered in grass.

315
00:30:16,763 --> 00:30:20,430
My great-grandmother said
that's why man never sees them.

316
00:30:20,601 --> 00:30:23,886
They will appear
as a bump in the lawns.

317
00:31:14,778 --> 00:31:16,320
Vick. Anna.

318
00:31:16,489 --> 00:31:19,988
Mr. Heep, the light over my desk
is still not working.

319
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:23,409
I promise I'll get to it.
How's the writing?

320
00:31:23,578 --> 00:31:27,196
- Slow.
- You look tired, Mr. Heep.

321
00:31:29,876 --> 00:31:32,333
How long have you been writing, Vick?

322
00:31:32,796 --> 00:31:34,670
Six months.

323
00:31:35,965 --> 00:31:38,124
What? I should finish, right?

324
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:41,505
It just... It just sits on his desk.
My brother's scared.

325
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,552
He'll do anything to get out of writing.

326
00:31:43,722 --> 00:31:47,057
See this? It's the third load of laundry
he's done this week.

327
00:31:48,686 --> 00:31:51,307
I can fix that light now, if you want.

328
00:32:34,815 --> 00:32:36,557
A cookbook.

329
00:32:39,068 --> 00:32:41,773
This has gotten s... S...

330
00:32:45,075 --> 00:32:46,781
Silly.

331
00:32:50,955 --> 00:32:53,991
- That's not how you fold.
- Mr. Heep, tell her to stop annoying me.

332
00:32:54,166 --> 00:32:55,412
I fixed the light.

333
00:32:55,585 --> 00:32:57,541
I'll make you dinner, Mr. Heep.
Thank you.

334
00:32:57,712 --> 00:32:59,123
You're both cooks?

335
00:32:59,297 --> 00:33:03,508
Who, him? He can't cook.
He's banned from the kitchen.

336
00:33:09,557 --> 00:33:11,548
Wait a minute,
I don't understand something.

337
00:33:11,724 --> 00:33:14,263
I'm sorry. My... My ladder...

338
00:33:14,979 --> 00:33:18,097
...accidentally bumped into your desk.

339
00:33:18,272 --> 00:33:21,807
I ended up seeing the title
of what it is you're writing.

340
00:33:21,984 --> 00:33:23,645
It said <i>The Cookbook.</i>

341
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:26,061
I know, it's a bad title, right?

342
00:33:26,239 --> 00:33:31,364
It's actually, you know, just my thoughts
on all our cultural problems...

343
00:33:31,537 --> 00:33:33,742
...and thoughts on leaders and stuff.

344
00:33:33,913 --> 00:33:36,914
I don't know who's gonna
wanna publish the thing.

345
00:33:38,586 --> 00:33:40,957
That is not how you fold.

346
00:33:52,557 --> 00:33:55,047
Your thoughts are very sad.

347
00:33:58,563 --> 00:34:01,136
Most are of one night.

348
00:34:02,817 --> 00:34:06,766
A night a man entered your home
when you were not there.

349
00:34:09,114 --> 00:34:12,614
He stole many things
and killed your wife and children.

350
00:34:13,786 --> 00:34:16,740
That is when you stopped being happy.

351
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:21,789
You were a doctor.

352
00:34:24,295 --> 00:34:26,967
I am very sorry for you.

353
00:34:28,132 --> 00:34:31,382
You believe you have no purpose.

354
00:34:31,802 --> 00:34:34,128
You help all that live here.

355
00:34:34,306 --> 00:34:37,177
Anybody can do this job, Story.

356
00:34:37,351 --> 00:34:39,639
You have a purpose.

357
00:34:40,519 --> 00:34:43,226
All beings have a purpose.

358
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:51,480
I know who you are.

359
00:34:52,699 --> 00:34:56,483
And I think that I've found your vessel.

360
00:34:56,827 --> 00:34:59,579
You know what I'm talking about, right?

361
00:35:02,291 --> 00:35:04,663
He's outside.
Do you need to see him alone...

362
00:35:04,835 --> 00:35:07,125
...or does he just need to see you?

363
00:35:17,514 --> 00:35:19,637
Cover yourself up.

364
00:35:24,186 --> 00:35:25,432
Hey.

365
00:35:25,606 --> 00:35:28,179
Mr. Heep, I know I sent in that form.

366
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,730
- I gave it to you on the stairs.
- Okay.

367
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:35,188
- My sister's all angry at me now.
- Well, I'll check again.

368
00:35:36,699 --> 00:35:39,369
By the way, this is my friend, Story.

369
00:35:42,539 --> 00:35:44,032
Hi.

370
00:35:59,722 --> 00:36:02,260
Yeah, you were right. Here it is.

371
00:36:03,601 --> 00:36:05,059
Great.

372
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:11,356
You all right? You look a little...

373
00:36:15,028 --> 00:36:17,318
I'm feeling a little funny. It's nothing.

374
00:36:18,074 --> 00:36:21,822
Is it a pins-and-needles kind of feeling?

375
00:36:23,286 --> 00:36:25,077
Yeah, kind of.

376
00:36:27,166 --> 00:36:28,708
Yeah.

377
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:32,748
Maybe you should go lie down.

378
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,420
Nice meeting you.

379
00:36:40,597 --> 00:36:44,510
I'm so very happy we saw each other.

380
00:37:06,913 --> 00:37:10,032
You don't have to leave right now,
do you?

381
00:37:11,208 --> 00:37:14,458
I have to go finish a couple of things.
I'll be back.

382
00:37:14,628 --> 00:37:16,253
Is that okay?

383
00:37:16,422 --> 00:37:19,043
Your words are very beautiful.

384
00:37:19,634 --> 00:37:23,632
Your heart is very big.

385
00:37:34,146 --> 00:37:37,398
No one knows about my family here.

386
00:37:39,445 --> 00:37:44,402
Please do not bring it up again.

387
00:37:56,293 --> 00:37:57,871
Coming.

388
00:37:59,213 --> 00:38:03,960
Sorry I'm late, Mrs. Bubchik.
It's... It's been a long day.

389
00:38:04,135 --> 00:38:05,510
Come on.

390
00:38:08,014 --> 00:38:11,632
Listen, he's on the toilet.
He's been having some gas issues.

391
00:38:11,809 --> 00:38:13,007
Don't tell him I told you.

392
00:38:13,186 --> 00:38:16,103
I... I thought the toilet was broken.
That's why I came.

393
00:38:16,271 --> 00:38:20,934
He may just be looking in the mirror.
I mean, he's got this growth on his ass.

394
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:23,862
Don't tell him I told you.

395
00:38:25,447 --> 00:38:29,030
Honey, Cleveland's here.
He's come to fix the toilet.

396
00:38:29,202 --> 00:38:32,237
Tell him I had it fixed already.
I called the plumber this morning.

397
00:38:32,413 --> 00:38:35,532
- Don't let it hurt his feelings.
- Right.

398
00:38:36,208 --> 00:38:38,960
It's... It's... It's okay.

399
00:38:39,128 --> 00:38:42,710
I should come when you call.
It's my job.

400
00:38:44,342 --> 00:38:47,460
What if that thing's out there?
It'll try to get you?

401
00:38:47,635 --> 00:38:50,469
There are laws. It will be safe.

402
00:38:50,637 --> 00:38:53,213
I'm allowed to leave this night.

403
00:39:02,358 --> 00:39:04,931
- How long do you think?
- It is time.

404
00:39:05,112 --> 00:39:06,391
You must not watch.

405
00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:09,027
Am I not allowed to watch you leave?

406
00:39:10,032 --> 00:39:11,277
I won't watch.

407
00:39:11,451 --> 00:39:14,570
Thank you for letting me wear
your beautiful shirt.

408
00:39:14,746 --> 00:39:16,405
You keep it.

409
00:40:47,876 --> 00:40:49,786
What happened?

410
00:40:51,172 --> 00:40:53,746
Okay. Okay.

411
00:40:53,925 --> 00:40:58,503
Hey. Calm down. Calm down.

412
00:40:58,679 --> 00:41:00,802
How'd you get those scratches?

413
00:41:01,766 --> 00:41:04,054
Did the eagle come?

414
00:41:05,938 --> 00:41:08,809
Did something go wrong? Story.

415
00:41:08,981 --> 00:41:12,398
Story. Was it that dog again?

416
00:41:19,699 --> 00:41:22,452
What's happening?
I thought it was gonna be safe.

417
00:41:35,217 --> 00:41:39,378
Your face doesn't look right.
Are you okay?

418
00:41:41,679 --> 00:41:44,005
Mr. Heep is here. He has a friend.

419
00:41:44,181 --> 00:41:45,974
She's beautiful.

420
00:41:46,143 --> 00:41:48,385
She's not feeling that well:

421
00:41:48,561 --> 00:41:50,389
So she's lying down in my room.

422
00:41:50,563 --> 00:41:52,971
Why is she here?
Why isn't she at his place?

423
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:56,317
Well, she got sick
in the stairwell downstairs.

424
00:41:57,445 --> 00:42:01,739
She's wearing no clothes
under his shirt.

425
00:42:01,909 --> 00:42:03,318
Blim-blam.

426
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:08,454
Mr. Heep is a player.

427
00:42:15,588 --> 00:42:18,423
- I hope it's all right.
- It's fine.

428
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:20,298
Do we need to take her to a hospital?

429
00:42:20,469 --> 00:42:23,255
- Oh, no. No, no, no. That's f... F... F...
- Fine?

430
00:42:24,139 --> 00:42:26,047
Thank you.

431
00:42:27,099 --> 00:42:28,724
No, she just needs some rest.

432
00:42:28,893 --> 00:42:31,217
She can stay here
as long as she needs to.

433
00:42:32,606 --> 00:42:34,893
You started writing again?

434
00:42:36,943 --> 00:42:38,436
Yeah.

435
00:42:39,027 --> 00:42:41,601
I'll be right back. Okay?

436
00:42:50,039 --> 00:42:54,414
Hello. M... Mrs. Choi,
is Young-Soon at home?

437
00:42:54,585 --> 00:42:55,960
No home.

438
00:42:56,126 --> 00:42:58,878
Great. Unbelievable.

439
00:43:05,052 --> 00:43:07,543
Hey. Hey.

440
00:43:09,724 --> 00:43:11,266
Thanks.

441
00:43:12,309 --> 00:43:14,800
- Yeah, hello?
- <i>Mr. Heep?</i>

442
00:43:14,978 --> 00:43:17,471
- Where are you?
- <i>At a club.</i>

443
00:43:17,648 --> 00:43:20,186
<i>Don't tell my mother.</i>
<i>She thinks I'm at a dance class.</i>

444
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:21,639
Okay.

445
00:43:22,027 --> 00:43:25,313
What happens if a narf gets scratched?

446
00:43:25,489 --> 00:43:29,487
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>Put my mother on, I'll ask her.</i>

447
00:43:30,954 --> 00:43:33,326
Mrs... Mrs. Choi. Mrs...

448
00:43:48,012 --> 00:43:50,418
- Hey.
- Hey. Thank you.

449
00:43:51,597 --> 00:43:54,266
Oh, she... She... She...
She doesn't look happy.

450
00:43:54,434 --> 00:43:57,056
<i>She said the story</i>
<i>her grandmother told...</i>

451
00:43:57,228 --> 00:44:00,431
<i>... said a scrunt has poison</i>
<i>that kill narfs.</i>

452
00:44:00,608 --> 00:44:04,853
<i>But she said</i>
<i>narfs can protect themselves.</i>

453
00:44:05,028 --> 00:44:08,777
<i>They are given a mud called Kii</i>
<i>that cures them.</i>

454
00:44:08,949 --> 00:44:11,273
<i>They keep it where they live.</i>

455
00:44:11,702 --> 00:44:14,193
Okay, okay.

456
00:44:14,369 --> 00:44:20,539
All right. Now, you said that the eagle
comes to take them back.

457
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:23,545
Right.
Now, what stops this green thing...

458
00:44:23,713 --> 00:44:27,876
...from attacking them
when the eagle comes?

459
00:44:28,052 --> 00:44:29,628
<i>You're funny, Mr. Heep.</i>

460
00:44:29,802 --> 00:44:32,092
- Yeah, I know.
- <i>You really thought about this.</i>

461
00:44:32,262 --> 00:44:34,469
<i>Put my mom on.</i>

462
00:44:56,119 --> 00:44:58,907
- Hey.
- Yeah. Hey. I'm sorry.

463
00:44:59,456 --> 00:45:00,701
Yes?

464
00:45:00,875 --> 00:45:03,909
<i>She said only a rogue scrunt</i>
<i>will break the law of that night...</i>

465
00:45:04,085 --> 00:45:05,911
<i>... because most scrunts are afraid.</i>

466
00:45:06,086 --> 00:45:07,831
Afraid of what?

467
00:45:08,007 --> 00:45:12,833
<i>Tartutic. They are the law keepers</i>
<i>in this bedtime story.</i>

468
00:45:13,012 --> 00:45:15,847
<i>Her grandmother said</i>
<i>there are three of them...</i>

469
00:45:16,014 --> 00:45:19,179
<i>... but they are called one name:</i>
<i>Tartutic.</i>

470
00:45:19,351 --> 00:45:23,597
<i>They live in the trees.</i>
<i>They are said to look like monkeys.</i>

471
00:45:24,021 --> 00:45:29,181
<i>No one knows for sure because</i>
<i>no one who has seen them has lived.</i>

472
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:33,405
<i>The legend says</i>
<i>that they were born so evil...</i>

473
00:45:33,574 --> 00:45:37,106
<i>... that they killed their parents</i>
<i>on the night they were born.</i>

474
00:45:37,284 --> 00:45:42,527
<i>The fear of them has kept justice</i>
<i>in The Blue World for centuries.</i>

475
00:45:42,706 --> 00:45:44,664
<i>Bye, Mr. Heep.</i>

476
00:45:51,257 --> 00:45:52,750
Thanks.

477
00:46:10,317 --> 00:46:14,099
<i>They are given a mud called Kii</i>
<i>that cures them.</i>

478
00:46:14,278 --> 00:46:16,603
<i>They keep it where they live.</i>

479
00:49:15,831 --> 00:49:19,163
My mom figured out I was at a club.
She made me come home.

480
00:49:19,335 --> 00:49:21,125
She tell me more of the story.

481
00:49:21,295 --> 00:49:23,998
- Why you wet?
- That's... Apartment business.

482
00:49:26,217 --> 00:49:30,592
Listen, Mr. Heep,
my mother thinks of you as stranger.

483
00:49:30,885 --> 00:49:34,385
You have to make her
see you as a child, innocent.

484
00:49:34,556 --> 00:49:37,512
Then she will tell you the bedtime story.

485
00:49:37,809 --> 00:49:40,300
There is a reason
the rules might be broken.

486
00:49:41,396 --> 00:49:44,148
<i>A Thousand Narfs</i>
is about a rare narf...

487
00:49:44,317 --> 00:49:46,688
...who comes once
in a generation of narfs...

488
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:49,862
...who is called the Madam Narf.

489
00:49:50,030 --> 00:49:53,530
Her vessel is important.
This vessel will cause change.

490
00:49:53,701 --> 00:49:58,527
But it is the Madam Narf herself
that is truly the key.

491
00:49:58,706 --> 00:50:02,206
She's considered
a queen to her people.

492
00:50:02,376 --> 00:50:06,123
Her return will be seen
as a great inspiration.

493
00:50:06,295 --> 00:50:09,831
A scrunt will do anything
to kill a Madam Narf...

494
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:12,713
...even forget his fears of the Tartutic.

495
00:50:12,885 --> 00:50:16,255
He might break the rules for that,
Mr. Heep.

496
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:19,846
Will she know
that she's a Madam Narf?

497
00:50:20,018 --> 00:50:23,635
No, that is moral of bedtime story.

498
00:50:23,813 --> 00:50:26,849
No one is ever told who they are.

499
00:50:27,025 --> 00:50:28,983
I think we are linked.

500
00:50:29,152 --> 00:50:31,690
It's more than just a story to me too.

501
00:50:31,864 --> 00:50:34,353
I actually want to believe it.

502
00:50:35,534 --> 00:50:37,242
Goodbye, Mr. Heep.

503
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:56,164
You have saved my life again.

504
00:50:57,972 --> 00:51:00,130
You made that room.

505
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:06,599
The cracks that I saw. Is that room
supposed to collapse eventually?

506
00:51:06,771 --> 00:51:10,222
I'm not allowed to speak
of The Blue World.

507
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,106
Well, the door needs a little work.

508
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:19,237
I noticed that you took things
from the apartment...

509
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:21,947
...that people left around the pool.

510
00:51:23,289 --> 00:51:28,115
That's how I saw you.
You were taking something off of a chair.

511
00:51:34,882 --> 00:51:38,501
I think I might know why
the scrunt needs to get you so bad.

512
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:41,382
Why did he break the rules tonight?

513
00:51:41,556 --> 00:51:45,554
As it turns out,
I think that you're someone...

514
00:51:45,976 --> 00:51:49,594
...very important to everyone.

515
00:52:28,643 --> 00:52:32,342
I tried to tell them about you.
I don't know if I did the right thing.

516
00:52:32,898 --> 00:52:35,351
I'm not sure how they're gonna react.

517
00:52:35,525 --> 00:52:37,481
I trust you.

518
00:52:37,777 --> 00:52:40,527
I believe you are here to protect me.

519
00:52:44,867 --> 00:52:46,693
Is the Kii working?

520
00:52:46,869 --> 00:52:48,909
Yes, thank you.

521
00:52:49,871 --> 00:52:52,827
If it is true that I am...

522
00:52:53,001 --> 00:52:55,324
He will keep coming after me.

523
00:52:55,503 --> 00:52:58,289
I will not be safe until...

524
00:52:58,463 --> 00:53:00,789
Until Tartutic comes.

525
00:53:15,021 --> 00:53:17,976
My mother said she saw a ghost once,
in the basement.

526
00:53:18,150 --> 00:53:20,771
I was the only one who believed her.

527
00:53:20,945 --> 00:53:23,400
She's not an apparition, Anna.

528
00:53:25,114 --> 00:53:27,487
I don't know who you are...

529
00:53:28,702 --> 00:53:31,157
...but you did something to me.

530
00:53:33,414 --> 00:53:35,324
My thoughts.

531
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:41,911
Everything became clearer.

532
00:53:43,090 --> 00:53:47,253
The fears that were muddling
my thoughts just went away.

533
00:53:48,054 --> 00:53:50,177
I can hear myself.

534
00:53:52,599 --> 00:53:55,222
Do you wish to know your future?

535
00:54:01,108 --> 00:54:04,311
A boy in the Midwest of this land...

536
00:54:04,487 --> 00:54:08,900
...will grow up in a home where your book
will be on the shelf and spoken of often.

537
00:54:09,074 --> 00:54:12,277
He will grow up
with these ideas in his head.

538
00:54:12,704 --> 00:54:15,786
He will grow into a great orator.

539
00:54:16,373 --> 00:54:19,327
He will speak and his words
will be heard throughout this land...

540
00:54:19,501 --> 00:54:21,789
...and throughout the world.

541
00:54:22,586 --> 00:54:26,880
This boy will become
leader of this country...

542
00:54:27,050 --> 00:54:29,920
...and begin a movement
of great change.

543
00:54:30,679 --> 00:54:33,715
He will speak of you and your words.

544
00:54:34,432 --> 00:54:38,300
Your book will be the seeds
of many of his great thoughts.

545
00:54:40,481 --> 00:54:43,150
It will be the seeds of change.

546
00:54:45,735 --> 00:54:47,775
<i>The Cookbook?</i>

547
00:54:55,827 --> 00:54:58,663
One, two, three.

548
00:55:33,032 --> 00:55:34,739
Oh, jeez.

549
00:55:43,541 --> 00:55:48,583
Could you tell her that I was interested
in hearing more of the story?

550
00:56:21,202 --> 00:56:24,239
Tell her it's a beautiful story.

551
00:56:25,583 --> 00:56:28,914
Are there... Are there any parts
that might be good to hear?

552
00:56:52,568 --> 00:56:54,606
- How is she?
- The medicine's helping her.

553
00:56:54,777 --> 00:56:57,695
I told her to stay under the shower.
She does better with water.

554
00:56:57,864 --> 00:57:00,900
I need to talk with her.
And Vick should be there too.

555
00:57:02,409 --> 00:57:06,739
I told them to wait right outside.
I'll tell them what you have to say.

556
00:57:07,539 --> 00:57:11,123
Tell her I know that she is not allowed
to tell about her world...

557
00:57:11,293 --> 00:57:15,588
...but maybe I could ask some questions,
and she can just say if it's right or wrong.

558
00:57:16,257 --> 00:57:20,300
Know what I did when I was little and me
and my girlfriends would get in trouble?

559
00:57:20,469 --> 00:57:22,628
My mom always wanted to know
what happened...

560
00:57:22,804 --> 00:57:25,010
...but I was like,
"I can't tell on my friends."

561
00:57:25,181 --> 00:57:29,594
So she came up with this way
of me telling her things without talking.

562
00:57:29,769 --> 00:57:33,815
She would say, " Touch your ear
or something if the answer is yes."

563
00:57:33,983 --> 00:57:36,518
So I would, and then
she would know certain things...

564
00:57:36,693 --> 00:57:39,693
...but I didn't really feel
like I told on my friends.

565
00:57:40,822 --> 00:57:44,405
It was cheating, I know,
but made me feel better.

566
00:57:44,992 --> 00:57:46,108
We're ready.

567
00:57:49,204 --> 00:57:52,324
So in this bedtime story...

568
00:57:52,498 --> 00:57:55,666
...the narf has come
to a preordained place.

569
00:57:55,835 --> 00:57:59,371
She must leave from the same spot.

570
00:57:59,548 --> 00:58:02,300
This eagle, the Great Eatlon,
coming to take her back...

571
00:58:02,469 --> 00:58:04,010
...is really very important.

572
00:58:04,179 --> 00:58:06,170
And here's the good stuff.

573
00:58:06,347 --> 00:58:10,262
There are humans
with powers that can help her.

574
00:58:10,434 --> 00:58:12,972
And these people
have been unconsciously drawn...

575
00:58:13,146 --> 00:58:15,302
...to live near the vessel.

576
00:58:15,481 --> 00:58:18,018
Now, these humans
don't know who they are...

577
00:58:18,192 --> 00:58:21,394
...and they always
appear in the story earlier.

578
00:58:21,570 --> 00:58:24,356
Are there humans with powers
that can help you...

579
00:58:24,530 --> 00:58:26,108
...but don't know who they are?

580
00:58:27,659 --> 00:58:28,690
That's a yes!

581
00:58:30,829 --> 00:58:35,489
They've got weird names:
A Symbolist, a Guardian and a Guild.

582
00:58:35,666 --> 00:58:36,829
Ask her if that's right.

583
00:58:40,088 --> 00:58:42,210
You want something.

584
00:58:43,050 --> 00:58:45,755
One of them. Vick.

585
00:58:45,927 --> 00:58:50,635
Mr. Heep. Mr. Heep is one of them.

586
00:58:51,891 --> 00:58:54,677
Which one? Guild, Guardian?

587
00:58:56,855 --> 00:58:59,097
She thinks Mr. Heep is the Guardian.

588
00:59:00,690 --> 00:59:03,858
I was told that there's a Symbolist...

589
00:59:04,027 --> 00:59:07,396
...an interpreter who can read signs
in clouds and other forms.

590
00:59:07,572 --> 00:59:09,898
He will interpret messages...

591
00:59:10,909 --> 00:59:13,697
...from the universe
if problems should arise.

592
00:59:13,871 --> 00:59:16,990
Do you know who the Symbolist
or Interpreter is?

593
00:59:17,456 --> 00:59:19,414
That's a no.

594
00:59:21,045 --> 00:59:23,583
And I was told that there is a Guild...

595
00:59:23,755 --> 00:59:26,543
...whose many hands
will combine to help.

596
00:59:26,717 --> 00:59:28,626
Does she know who they are?

597
00:59:28,802 --> 00:59:31,009
There is a Guild or something.

598
00:59:31,179 --> 00:59:33,965
They're supposed to help
with their hands.

599
00:59:34,682 --> 00:59:36,592
That's another no.

600
00:59:38,269 --> 00:59:39,597
All right, there's one other.

601
00:59:39,771 --> 00:59:43,389
I don't know if it's worth mentioning.
It's not in the stories all the time.

602
00:59:43,567 --> 00:59:47,065
It's a human, usually a female...

603
00:59:47,237 --> 00:59:48,945
...so full of hope...

604
00:59:49,114 --> 00:59:53,940
...that they can awaken
the life force in all things.

605
00:59:54,117 --> 00:59:56,277
Now, that one is called the Healer.

606
00:59:56,454 --> 00:59:58,612
And you can tell
that they're in the story...

607
00:59:58,791 --> 01:00:01,744
...because butterflies
are drawn to the Healer.

608
01:00:03,670 --> 01:00:06,373
- Butterflies.
- The last one's a Healer.

609
01:00:06,547 --> 01:00:09,121
You don't know
any of these people, do you?

610
01:00:14,806 --> 01:00:17,972
Reading? A book?

611
01:00:18,143 --> 01:00:20,050
Learning.

612
01:00:21,855 --> 01:00:24,059
She thinks it has to be learned.

613
01:00:24,231 --> 01:00:26,519
Is the eagle
going to come back for her?

614
01:00:29,902 --> 01:00:31,362
Only one last time.

615
01:00:31,905 --> 01:00:34,028
Mr. Heep,
you know the people in this building.

616
01:00:34,199 --> 01:00:35,824
You have to find them.

617
01:00:43,291 --> 01:00:44,833
What is it?

618
01:00:45,001 --> 01:00:47,208
You know these walls are paper-thin?

619
01:00:47,378 --> 01:00:50,748
I can hear all that bloody noise
downstairs like they were in my kitchen.

620
01:00:50,925 --> 01:00:53,213
Can you do anything about that?

621
01:00:55,137 --> 01:00:56,880
Of course not.

622
01:00:57,514 --> 01:01:01,641
- What is it you want, anyway?
- Well, I had a question.

623
01:01:01,809 --> 01:01:05,806
You're an expert on p... P... Plots, right?

624
01:01:05,981 --> 01:01:10,773
You know who's gonna do what in a book
or a movie even at the beginning, yes?

625
01:01:10,943 --> 01:01:14,311
There is no originality left in the world,
Mr. Heep.

626
01:01:14,489 --> 01:01:16,528
That is a sad fact I've come to live with.

627
01:01:16,699 --> 01:01:21,240
Well, if there was a mystery...

628
01:01:21,411 --> 01:01:24,780
...and a guy had to figure out
who some people were...

629
01:01:24,956 --> 01:01:28,206
...like he had to find a symbol guy...

630
01:01:28,376 --> 01:01:31,543
...someone who can
figure out messages...

631
01:01:31,713 --> 01:01:37,632
...and a guild of people who are going
to be important at the end as a group.

632
01:01:38,137 --> 01:01:40,507
How would you figure that out?

633
01:01:41,764 --> 01:01:44,599
The symbol person should be simple.

634
01:01:45,018 --> 01:01:48,516
Look for any character
who is doing something mundane...

635
01:01:48,688 --> 01:01:50,396
...but required analysis.

636
01:01:50,565 --> 01:01:53,934
Someone who was skilled at puzzles.

637
01:01:54,110 --> 01:01:56,400
Joey, you can't have cereal for lunch.

638
01:01:56,572 --> 01:02:00,652
This picture on the cereal box
is supposed to make you feel happy.

639
01:02:01,074 --> 01:02:05,074
I feel sad, like that time
you forgot to pick me up at school.

640
01:02:05,579 --> 01:02:10,822
Joey, Mr. Heep appears disquieted.
Can you give us a moment alone?

641
01:02:11,585 --> 01:02:13,494
Sure, Dad.

642
01:02:15,088 --> 01:02:16,963
<i>As for the guild...</i>

643
01:02:17,132 --> 01:02:20,253
...look for any group of characters
that are always seen together...

644
01:02:20,427 --> 01:02:23,298
...and have seemingly irrelevant
and tedious dialogue...

645
01:02:23,472 --> 01:02:25,760
...that seems to regurgitate forever.

646
01:02:25,932 --> 01:02:29,302
And you just sit around
and talk about nothing?

647
01:02:29,478 --> 01:02:32,349
Oh, we talk about serious issues.

648
01:02:32,523 --> 01:02:34,266
On occasion.

649
01:02:37,820 --> 01:02:41,603
We talked about Martin Luther King
at the Tequila Hut Tuesday night.

650
01:02:43,617 --> 01:02:44,992
You talked about that?

651
01:02:45,161 --> 01:02:48,114
<i>This is the writer's way</i>
<i>of establishing characters...</i>

652
01:02:48,289 --> 01:02:51,159
<i>... who will be important</i>
<i>further in the story.</i>

653
01:02:51,541 --> 01:02:54,661
Is there anything further
I can assist you with during my naptime?

654
01:02:54,836 --> 01:02:58,668
No. No, Mr. Farber. Thank you.

655
01:03:14,063 --> 01:03:17,146
Story, these young men are the Guild.

656
01:03:17,317 --> 01:03:20,351
And Mr. Dury... Mr. Dury?

657
01:03:21,695 --> 01:03:24,400
Mr. Dury is the Interpreter.

658
01:03:25,740 --> 01:03:29,608
And there's one other person.
Mrs. Bell, could you come in here, please?

659
01:03:30,327 --> 01:03:34,079
This is Mrs. Bell, the Healer.

660
01:03:35,458 --> 01:03:38,626
Story wants to go home and she can't.

661
01:03:38,795 --> 01:03:41,333
Tomorrow night is her last chance.

662
01:03:42,172 --> 01:03:44,380
Mr. Dury, please step forward.

663
01:03:44,552 --> 01:03:48,963
- Mr. Heep, you're not stuttering.
- Yes, I know. I know. It's only around her.

664
01:03:51,956 --> 01:03:56,034
Now, the Interpreter will tell us what
to do if something should go wrong.

665
01:03:56,210 --> 01:04:00,159
He will use an instrument
specific to him...

666
01:04:00,338 --> 01:04:02,211
...to interpret.

667
01:04:03,759 --> 01:04:05,585
- Try it, Mr. Dury.
- I don't...

668
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:08,251
Let's just see what happens.

669
01:04:08,846 --> 01:04:11,847
I think that there's
a message in there for us.

670
01:04:16,438 --> 01:04:21,394
Well, nine letters across
is the word "essential."

671
01:04:23,527 --> 01:04:26,280
And it touches...

672
01:04:26,782 --> 01:04:31,358
...27 down, which is "scheme."

673
01:04:31,534 --> 01:04:33,824
- Essential scheme.
- Yes.

674
01:04:33,996 --> 01:04:37,280
Now, those were the first two words
that I deciphered in this puzzle...

675
01:04:37,458 --> 01:04:40,827
...and I thought that was...
Well, I thought that was weird.

676
01:04:45,548 --> 01:04:47,708
There's a word that seems
out of place to me.

677
01:04:47,885 --> 01:04:51,467
- Yes.
- It's a six-letter word for "get-together."

678
01:04:51,639 --> 01:04:53,512
- "Soiree."
- Soiree.

679
01:04:54,266 --> 01:04:57,302
Soiree could mean "party." How
could a...? How does a party help us?

680
01:04:57,476 --> 01:05:00,264
Well, I guess I thought that, you know...

681
01:05:00,438 --> 01:05:05,599
...a party is interesting because
this thing out there is an animal...

682
01:05:05,777 --> 01:05:08,349
...and it probably has
a very keen sense of smell.

683
01:05:08,528 --> 01:05:12,362
- Why is everyone staring at me?
- Go on. Go on, Mr. Dury. Go on.

684
01:05:12,534 --> 01:05:16,282
Humans have a pungent smell
to animals...

685
01:05:16,454 --> 01:05:19,822
...so I thought that maybe everyone
gathered together would confuse him...

686
01:05:19,998 --> 01:05:23,748
...and he wouldn't be able to distinguish
her from amongst all of us.

687
01:05:23,918 --> 01:05:24,998
Does that sound right?

688
01:05:25,172 --> 01:05:27,791
He's hearing the voice of God
through a crossword puzzle.

689
01:05:27,965 --> 01:05:31,001
- We're just playing here, right?
- No. Wait, wait.

690
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:35,764
See, I don't think that the Great Eatlon...

691
01:05:35,931 --> 01:05:39,715
...will land in the presence
of beings not from its world.

692
01:05:40,059 --> 01:05:42,978
She didn't want me to watch
when the eagle came the first time.

693
01:05:43,146 --> 01:05:45,269
That's before she knew
that I was the Guardian.

694
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:47,184
Would I be able to watch now?

695
01:05:48,987 --> 01:05:52,353
But there will be...
There'll be hundreds of people at a party.

696
01:05:52,530 --> 01:05:56,195
It won't work. It won't work. See if
there's anything else in there, Mr. Dury.

697
01:05:57,744 --> 01:06:00,862
This word did give me great difficulty,
and then it came to me.

698
01:06:01,039 --> 01:06:04,539
- "Sonorous."
- Sonorous, sonorous.

699
01:06:04,710 --> 01:06:07,664
It could mean music, a band.

700
01:06:07,838 --> 01:06:12,250
Maybe we gather everyone inside
at the last minute to hear a band...

701
01:06:12,425 --> 01:06:15,876
...and we who are of the world
stay with her...

702
01:06:16,054 --> 01:06:19,838
...to help her with that thing and...

703
01:06:20,016 --> 01:06:21,760
Until she's taken.

704
01:06:22,851 --> 01:06:24,561
He's a prophet.

705
01:06:24,728 --> 01:06:27,896
We're all just seeing what we want to.
I just made all that up.

706
01:06:28,065 --> 01:06:30,771
No, I think that it worked.
I think that it worked.

707
01:06:30,943 --> 01:06:33,648
That is why they're the Guild.

708
01:06:33,822 --> 01:06:37,865
I think they're supposed
to use their hands to throw us a party.

709
01:06:38,034 --> 01:06:40,489
- Is he serious?
- We're gonna throw a party.

710
01:06:41,204 --> 01:06:44,737
- Huge party. We are serious.
- Tell them...

711
01:06:44,914 --> 01:06:48,034
Anything you can do for us,
all right? Tables...

712
01:06:48,210 --> 01:06:51,744
We definitely need a band. It's like
the most important thing. Oh, my God.

713
01:06:58,594 --> 01:07:01,465
You don't think this is gonna work,
do you?

714
01:07:03,266 --> 01:07:05,260
I'm nervous too.

715
01:07:06,186 --> 01:07:08,855
You being out there tomorrow night.

716
01:07:09,313 --> 01:07:12,516
Me not knowing what to do
as the Guardian.

717
01:07:14,818 --> 01:07:18,947
Think I can go out there tonight
and maybe face that thing without you?

718
01:07:20,157 --> 01:07:22,481
Get a little practice with him?

719
01:07:22,659 --> 01:07:24,617
Scare him, maybe?

720
01:07:24,788 --> 01:07:26,780
Show him who's boss?

721
01:07:30,418 --> 01:07:32,827
I know you wanna get home.

722
01:07:42,096 --> 01:07:44,219
You will need a mirror.

723
01:07:45,056 --> 01:07:47,512
<i>Can you hear me? I'm here.</i>

724
01:07:47,976 --> 01:07:50,266
Peer over your shoulder carefully.

725
01:07:50,438 --> 01:07:55,146
It is only through a mirror that one can
see the eyes of a scrunt in the grass.

726
01:07:55,317 --> 01:08:00,193
It will appear to you
as two red spots in the darkness.

727
01:08:01,824 --> 01:08:04,278
<i>Yeah, I... I don't... I...</i>

728
01:08:05,869 --> 01:08:07,411
Wait.

729
01:08:07,954 --> 01:08:09,782
I see him.

730
01:08:12,918 --> 01:08:15,588
The Guardian has instincts
of when the scrunt will attack.

731
01:08:15,755 --> 01:08:18,590
He is a great weapon against him.

732
01:08:19,257 --> 01:08:23,421
You should walk backwards
towards him.

733
01:08:23,595 --> 01:08:26,679
When you are close enough
to be certain of his position...

734
01:08:26,847 --> 01:08:29,421
...turn and face the hidden scrunt.

735
01:08:34,021 --> 01:08:35,979
I'm facing him.

736
01:08:37,108 --> 01:08:39,065
<i>I am scared.</i>

737
01:08:39,527 --> 01:08:42,314
<i>It is about to get very dangerous.</i>

738
01:08:42,613 --> 01:08:44,404
Okay.

739
01:08:46,201 --> 01:08:47,992
I'm ready.

740
01:08:48,952 --> 01:08:54,029
You must invoke the ancient words
<i>"Nef Ra Mora."</i>

741
01:08:54,207 --> 01:08:59,498
It is a command to rise
and a challenge to fight.

742
01:09:08,596 --> 01:09:10,470
<i>What is happening?</i>

743
01:09:12,393 --> 01:09:14,551
He's rising out of the grass.

744
01:09:16,020 --> 01:09:19,354
His legs are bending and coiling...

745
01:09:20,233 --> 01:09:21,976
...underneath him.

746
01:09:22,277 --> 01:09:26,439
Oh, my God. Oh, my... Oh, no.

747
01:09:27,157 --> 01:09:28,614
<i>He's standing in front of me.</i>

748
01:09:28,783 --> 01:09:30,492
The Guardian can hypnotize a scrunt.

749
01:09:30,661 --> 01:09:33,233
If the Guardian looks directly
into the scrunt's eyes...

750
01:09:33,412 --> 01:09:37,030
...it will be compelled to stay frozen
or move backwards.

751
01:09:37,585 --> 01:09:40,418
What is the J.G. Scrunt's reaction?
Is he frightened?

752
01:09:40,587 --> 01:09:42,079
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

753
01:09:42,255 --> 01:09:44,377
- Look into his eyes.
- <i>I am.</i>

754
01:09:44,548 --> 01:09:47,122
- Is he moving away?
- <i>No.</i>

755
01:09:47,301 --> 01:09:49,423
The Guardian can control his mind.

756
01:09:49,595 --> 01:09:52,465
The J.G. Scrunt will not
be able to attack.

757
01:09:52,765 --> 01:09:57,426
- Okay.
- <i>You must look into his eyes.</i>

758
01:09:57,604 --> 01:09:59,346
I think something's wrong.

759
01:09:59,521 --> 01:10:01,597
<i>He's stepping forward.</i>

760
01:10:02,231 --> 01:10:03,810
He's stepping forward?

761
01:10:03,984 --> 01:10:05,975
Something's wrong!

762
01:10:08,405 --> 01:10:10,944
Cleveland, run!

763
01:10:16,872 --> 01:10:20,204
What is it you are doing?

764
01:10:21,792 --> 01:10:23,537
Hey there.

765
01:10:25,381 --> 01:10:30,421
Anything I can do for you there,
Mr. F... F... F... Farber?

766
01:10:30,886 --> 01:10:32,378
No.

767
01:10:39,353 --> 01:10:43,136
So how was the m... Movie?

768
01:10:43,314 --> 01:10:44,974
- Sucked.
- Oh, what a... What a shame.

769
01:10:45,149 --> 01:10:48,814
Characters were walking around
saying their thoughts out loud.

770
01:10:48,985 --> 01:10:50,564
Who does that?

771
01:10:50,738 --> 01:10:51,981
And a typical romance...

772
01:10:52,155 --> 01:10:56,368
...where the couple finally tell each other
they love one another in the rain.

773
01:10:57,078 --> 01:11:01,157
Why does everyone like to stand around
and talk in the rain in movies?

774
01:11:01,747 --> 01:11:03,907
Well, maybe...

775
01:11:04,335 --> 01:11:08,545
Maybe it's a metaphor for purification,
starting new.

776
01:11:09,673 --> 01:11:12,509
No. It's not.

777
01:11:13,010 --> 01:11:14,918
Are you okay?

778
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:19,800
He'll choose to move
only when no one is looking.

779
01:11:19,975 --> 01:11:22,097
They're masters of hiding.

780
01:11:22,269 --> 01:11:26,182
A scrunt will hide unless
he cannot hide in his environment.

781
01:11:26,355 --> 01:11:29,391
If a tenant hadn't walked by...

782
01:11:29,567 --> 01:11:32,189
...I'd have been eaten alive.

783
01:11:33,988 --> 01:11:36,561
I had no powers over him.

784
01:11:36,742 --> 01:11:39,149
You are not the Guardian.

785
01:11:40,662 --> 01:11:43,118
I do not understand.

786
01:11:49,377 --> 01:11:51,917
I cannot protect you.

787
01:11:52,798 --> 01:11:55,170
Where are the Tartutic?

788
01:11:55,342 --> 01:11:57,713
Why isn't he being punished?

789
01:11:58,512 --> 01:12:01,002
Where is the justice?

790
01:12:19,823 --> 01:12:22,279
How come you don't ask
about bedtime story anymore?

791
01:12:26,581 --> 01:12:28,242
I've been busy.

792
01:12:34,046 --> 01:12:36,963
You... You coming to the party tonight?

793
01:12:37,341 --> 01:12:39,168
I have to study.

794
01:12:39,344 --> 01:12:41,171
Bye, Mr. Heep.

795
01:12:47,726 --> 01:12:51,011
Mr. Leeds,
did you hear about the p... Party?

796
01:12:55,484 --> 01:12:56,729
You coming?

797
01:12:56,903 --> 01:12:58,775
<i>- A picture here</i>
<i>of the enemy they're...</i>

798
01:12:58,945 --> 01:13:01,271
Does man deserve to be saved,
Mr. Heep?

799
01:13:01,448 --> 01:13:03,572
- What?
- Man.

800
01:13:07,078 --> 01:13:08,573
Yes.

801
01:13:09,038 --> 01:13:10,829
That's not the answer I expected.

802
01:13:10,998 --> 01:13:14,618
Why'd you a... Ask me that?

803
01:13:14,962 --> 01:13:17,167
I know about your family.

804
01:13:17,756 --> 01:13:20,627
I looked you up
when you started working here.

805
01:13:21,386 --> 01:13:23,673
I know someone killed them.

806
01:13:23,845 --> 01:13:28,341
But you can't give up.
You can't hide here, son.

807
01:13:29,893 --> 01:13:31,435
I know.

808
01:13:31,601 --> 01:13:34,011
You don't wanna become like me.

809
01:13:35,271 --> 01:13:39,186
By the way, your invitation would sound
more real if it had the guy's name on it.

810
01:13:39,862 --> 01:13:42,432
There's something strange going on
around this building.

811
01:13:42,613 --> 01:13:44,488
Don't think I haven't noticed.

812
01:13:51,704 --> 01:13:53,365
It is finished?

813
01:13:56,502 --> 01:13:59,041
You can see things in the future?

814
01:13:59,213 --> 01:14:01,206
Some things.

815
01:14:01,715 --> 01:14:04,171
I have a question to ask you.

816
01:14:05,010 --> 01:14:08,296
I will do my best to answer it.

817
01:14:08,471 --> 01:14:10,679
You'll tell me the truth, right?

818
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:13,643
Yes.

819
01:14:14,686 --> 01:14:18,220
Change doesn't happen the way
you say it's gonna happen...

820
01:14:18,398 --> 01:14:22,016
...without dramatic events
that accelerate thinking.

821
01:14:23,028 --> 01:14:24,309
I wrote this thing.

822
01:14:24,487 --> 01:14:28,152
It might take decades or longer
to create a reaction...

823
01:14:28,617 --> 01:14:31,653
...before it anchors
in the consciousness.

824
01:14:32,328 --> 01:14:35,993
That's not the type of change
you're telling me is gonna happen, right?

825
01:14:37,792 --> 01:14:40,792
I was wondering
why he didn't meet me...

826
01:14:41,921 --> 01:14:44,458
...this leader who's just a boy.

827
01:14:45,050 --> 01:14:49,591
If he was so inspired by my words,
why didn't he try to meet me?

828
01:14:50,845 --> 01:14:54,891
There's a lot of things in <i>The Cookbook</i>
people won't like to hear.

829
01:14:57,394 --> 01:15:02,685
I'm not anything, you know?
I don't think I'm anything special.

830
01:15:02,859 --> 01:15:06,024
So I started thinking,
"How is this gonna happen?

831
01:15:06,194 --> 01:15:10,145
Why are people gonna suddenly
take me seriously?

832
01:15:11,074 --> 01:15:13,363
And why didn't he meet me?"

833
01:15:16,579 --> 01:15:19,118
And I thought of how it could happen.

834
01:15:19,582 --> 01:15:24,541
Story, I wanted to ask you,
is something gonna happen to me?

835
01:15:25,756 --> 01:15:29,125
Is someone gonna kill me
because I write this?

836
01:15:29,592 --> 01:15:31,252
Yes.

837
01:15:31,761 --> 01:15:35,426
Man thinks they're each alone
in this world.

838
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:37,805
It is not true.

839
01:15:38,393 --> 01:15:40,719
You are all connected.

840
01:15:41,270 --> 01:15:44,935
One act can one day affect all.

841
01:15:50,113 --> 01:15:53,528
What are you guys whispering about?

842
01:15:53,699 --> 01:15:56,735
Is he trying to get you to tell him
how many kids he's gonna have?

843
01:15:56,911 --> 01:15:59,994
I told him eight, all bratty boys.

844
01:16:00,164 --> 01:16:03,283
I asked her if she knew the name
of the deaf, dumb and blind guy...

845
01:16:03,458 --> 01:16:05,118
...that's gonna marry you.

846
01:16:05,293 --> 01:16:08,461
Very funny, Herb.

847
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:21,135
Okay.

848
01:16:22,853 --> 01:16:25,225
Don't tell my sister.

849
01:16:56,344 --> 01:17:00,212
Hi. I'm Mr. Farber.

850
01:17:02,182 --> 01:17:04,639
I wanted to thank you.

851
01:17:05,101 --> 01:17:10,145
I was completely surprised by all of this.

852
01:17:10,608 --> 01:17:14,688
I was expecting some kind of greeting,
of course.

853
01:17:16,113 --> 01:17:19,113
But this is beyond my expectations.

854
01:17:21,533 --> 01:17:23,610
I'm 13B.

855
01:17:24,496 --> 01:17:27,698
- Oh, yeah. How you doing? What's up?
- Oh, yeah. Good for you.

856
01:17:29,333 --> 01:17:32,335
I know of your future, Cleveland.

857
01:17:32,838 --> 01:17:34,913
Do you wanna hear it?

858
01:17:35,091 --> 01:17:36,548
No.

859
01:17:39,177 --> 01:17:42,878
Tell me what happens
when the eagle takes you back.

860
01:17:43,305 --> 01:17:46,426
It is only what I have been told
by others.

861
01:17:46,893 --> 01:17:52,231
They tell us the world will line up
and reveal we are on the right path...

862
01:17:52,399 --> 01:17:54,771
...that the universe will give us signs.

863
01:17:55,609 --> 01:17:57,851
The Tartutic could have not come yet.

864
01:17:58,029 --> 01:18:01,398
I can still sense
the scrunt's presence near.

865
01:18:01,908 --> 01:18:07,032
You have to believe
that this all makes sense somehow.

866
01:18:10,416 --> 01:18:13,251
I don't know why I'm the Madam Narf.

867
01:18:13,418 --> 01:18:18,496
I'm not special. I'm clumsy.
They make fun of me.

868
01:18:18,675 --> 01:18:21,082
I don't know how to lead.

869
01:18:22,802 --> 01:18:26,846
Do you get sick
every time you break a rule?

870
01:18:27,557 --> 01:18:30,891
Every time that you tell me
something that you shouldn't?

871
01:18:34,064 --> 01:18:36,636
There's a storm coming.

872
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:44,442
- I am scared.
- It's okay to be scared.

873
01:18:44,783 --> 01:18:47,356
I do not have courage.

874
01:18:48,036 --> 01:18:50,158
I do not want to be a Madam Narf.

875
01:18:50,329 --> 01:18:52,654
You do what you think is right.

876
01:18:52,832 --> 01:18:55,288
You are very brave.

877
01:18:56,168 --> 01:18:59,585
You were always meant to lead, Story.

878
01:19:02,716 --> 01:19:04,509
Cleveland...

879
01:19:05,886 --> 01:19:08,555
...the Great Eatlon is coming.

880
01:20:21,168 --> 01:20:22,579
Okay.

881
01:20:26,256 --> 01:20:28,546
I'm glad you read my journal.

882
01:20:29,676 --> 01:20:33,377
Don't worry. We're all watching you.

883
01:21:07,421 --> 01:21:10,505
Oh, come on.
The music should have started already.

884
01:21:12,217 --> 01:21:14,840
Do not leave this spot.

885
01:21:17,515 --> 01:21:19,672
- Yo, come on.
- Hey.

886
01:21:28,275 --> 01:21:30,480
Find a mirror.

887
01:22:24,496 --> 01:22:27,699
Why hasn't the m... Music started?

888
01:22:27,875 --> 01:22:31,326
It's been working smooth.
We've been playing with it all night.

889
01:22:32,671 --> 01:22:34,960
You used up the battery.

890
01:22:35,215 --> 01:22:37,006
Wave to him.

891
01:22:46,643 --> 01:22:48,930
They told her that the universe
would line up...

892
01:22:49,103 --> 01:22:53,019
...and reveal that we're
on the right p... Path.

893
01:22:53,399 --> 01:22:55,605
Why isn't this working?

894
01:23:23,387 --> 01:23:24,965
Okay.

895
01:23:38,318 --> 01:23:41,734
Sometimes animals just look dead.

896
01:23:46,411 --> 01:23:50,573
Something went wrong.
They took her inside, up by the pool.

897
01:24:20,609 --> 01:24:23,564
It is not time for you to go.

898
01:24:25,864 --> 01:24:30,407
It is not time for you to go.

899
01:24:37,961 --> 01:24:40,877
Isn't this supposed to work?

900
01:24:45,301 --> 01:24:48,751
Fourteen across.

901
01:24:50,805 --> 01:24:52,430
No. No.

902
01:24:57,438 --> 01:24:59,180
I don't know.

903
01:25:00,733 --> 01:25:02,523
I don't know.

904
01:25:05,944 --> 01:25:10,488
This world is about finding
your purpose, right?

905
01:25:10,658 --> 01:25:14,988
And the only way to do that is to find
your own voice. You told us that.

906
01:25:15,497 --> 01:25:18,996
I don't feel like an Interpreter.

907
01:25:19,582 --> 01:25:22,833
Is it possible that that isn't my purpose?

908
01:25:24,171 --> 01:25:28,465
I mean, I don't see anything
in these words, and I didn't before.

909
01:25:31,261 --> 01:25:33,836
And finding one's purpose
is a profound thing.

910
01:25:34,015 --> 01:25:37,015
Sometimes it isn't always
what it seems.

911
01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:42,478
What if these young men
are not the Guild?

912
01:25:42,646 --> 01:25:44,225
Look at what happened at the party.

913
01:25:44,399 --> 01:25:46,806
These things haven't seemed right
from the beginning.

914
01:25:46,985 --> 01:25:50,604
Why are you so certain that I am
the Interpreter and they are the Guild?

915
01:25:55,327 --> 01:25:57,864
He was so sure.

916
01:25:58,037 --> 01:25:59,448
What?

917
01:25:59,914 --> 01:26:01,574
I...

918
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:05,247
...asked someone.

919
01:26:05,420 --> 01:26:07,662
He acted like he knew.

920
01:26:07,838 --> 01:26:09,796
What kind of person
would be so arrogant...

921
01:26:09,966 --> 01:26:12,717
...to presume to know the intention
of another human being?

922
01:26:12,886 --> 01:26:14,961
Who put this young girl's life
in jeopardy?

923
01:26:22,103 --> 01:26:23,845
Hello?

924
01:26:31,237 --> 01:26:34,569
Is the bathroom on this level working?

925
01:26:36,908 --> 01:26:39,198
A dog inside the building.

926
01:26:39,369 --> 01:26:42,323
Go. Shoo!

927
01:26:47,668 --> 01:26:49,412
Why, you're not a dog at all.

928
01:26:53,132 --> 01:26:54,793
My God.

929
01:26:55,426 --> 01:26:58,511
This is like a moment
from a horror movie.

930
01:27:00,265 --> 01:27:03,467
It is precisely the moment
where the mutation or beast...

931
01:27:03,643 --> 01:27:07,307
...will attempt to kill
an unlikable side character.

932
01:27:07,479 --> 01:27:11,644
But in stories where there
has been no prior cursing, nudity...

933
01:27:11,819 --> 01:27:15,020
...killing or death,
such as in a family film...

934
01:27:15,195 --> 01:27:19,109
...the unlikable character
will narrowly escape his encounter...

935
01:27:19,283 --> 01:27:21,655
...and be referenced again
later in the story...

936
01:27:21,828 --> 01:27:24,994
...having learned valuable lessons.

937
01:27:25,581 --> 01:27:27,454
He may even be given
a humorous moment...

938
01:27:27,625 --> 01:27:30,661
...to allow the audience
to feel good about him.

939
01:27:32,838 --> 01:27:35,873
This is where I turn to run.

940
01:27:36,050 --> 01:27:38,457
You will leap for me.

941
01:27:38,636 --> 01:27:40,628
I will shut the door.

942
01:27:40,805 --> 01:27:45,300
And you will land
a fraction of a second too late.

943
01:27:48,561 --> 01:27:50,389
Why would they lie to her
about Tartutic?

944
01:27:50,564 --> 01:27:54,064
These cannot just be fairy tales
they tell to make the narfs risk their lives.

945
01:27:54,234 --> 01:27:55,693
This has gotta be about faith.

946
01:27:55,860 --> 01:27:58,895
Her world works by different rules
than ours. She may not be dead.

947
01:27:59,073 --> 01:28:02,025
- We need to be told what to do.
- We need to find the Interpreter.

948
01:28:02,199 --> 01:28:04,738
How are we suddenly
going to realize someone's purpose?

949
01:28:04,912 --> 01:28:08,326
This is someone doing something ancient.
An ancient thing in modern times.

950
01:28:08,497 --> 01:28:11,332
It could be someone who sees purity
in what we see as mundane.

951
01:28:11,501 --> 01:28:13,494
Sees the voice of God
in the ordinary.

952
01:28:13,670 --> 01:28:15,828
He is someone who sees meaning
in the ordinary.

953
01:28:16,006 --> 01:28:19,503
Does anyone have any idea
who this is?

954
01:28:21,677 --> 01:28:23,220
My God.

955
01:28:25,346 --> 01:28:26,807
I do.

956
01:28:27,891 --> 01:28:30,097
There is a message.

957
01:28:32,771 --> 01:28:35,179
There is a ceremony to be done.

958
01:28:35,358 --> 01:28:37,646
You're doing great, Joey.

959
01:28:39,613 --> 01:28:44,108
The hands of the Guild will be needed,
plus two others.

960
01:28:44,283 --> 01:28:47,118
Joey, who is the Guild?

961
01:28:49,497 --> 01:28:52,865
It is a ceremony of seven sisters.

962
01:28:53,042 --> 01:28:55,578
Sisters? The Guild is women?

963
01:28:56,877 --> 01:28:59,880
They will touch together
with their hearts as one...

964
01:29:00,047 --> 01:29:02,503
...to bring strength to the moment.

965
01:29:02,676 --> 01:29:04,502
Nice, Joey.

966
01:29:07,055 --> 01:29:09,890
You will need a man
who has no secrets...

967
01:29:10,059 --> 01:29:13,841
...and one whose opinion
is highly respected as witnesses.

968
01:29:15,270 --> 01:29:20,064
All must hurry.
This will all be over in moments.

969
01:29:49,721 --> 01:29:52,212
Mr. Perez de la Torre.

970
01:29:52,890 --> 01:29:58,265
I need to speak with your
f... F... F... F... Five daughters.

971
01:30:02,859 --> 01:30:06,939
Honey? Honey,
there's some people here to see you.

972
01:30:13,994 --> 01:30:15,489
Sweetheart?

973
01:30:17,122 --> 01:30:19,530
He's probably rinsing his mouth.

974
01:30:19,708 --> 01:30:21,618
He's got terrible breath.

975
01:30:21,795 --> 01:30:24,332
Don't tell him I told you.

976
01:30:38,726 --> 01:30:42,676
<i>- Huge explosions</i>
<i>right in the very heart of the capital.</i>

977
01:30:42,856 --> 01:30:48,100
<i>Several explosions, I felt at least four</i>
<i>very close to the center of the city.</i>

978
01:31:55,636 --> 01:31:58,173
I think we have everybody.

979
01:32:01,057 --> 01:32:05,101
A man who has no secrets...

980
01:32:05,270 --> 01:32:10,726
...and one whose opinion
I greatly respect.

981
01:32:10,900 --> 01:32:15,064
They will be w... W... Witnesses.

982
01:32:15,238 --> 01:32:19,614
Will the Guild please come forward?

983
01:32:24,247 --> 01:32:25,824
Yeah.

984
01:32:27,041 --> 01:32:29,034
And you make seven.

985
01:32:29,752 --> 01:32:31,744
Seven sisters.

986
01:32:34,256 --> 01:32:36,166
Come, come.

987
01:32:38,511 --> 01:32:40,006
Yeah.

988
01:32:40,764 --> 01:32:43,052
Everything's right now.

989
01:32:47,810 --> 01:32:50,052
Come back to us now.

990
01:32:51,189 --> 01:32:55,354
Come back to us now, honey.
Come back to us.

991
01:33:02,283 --> 01:33:03,481
I can't believe it.

992
01:33:03,659 --> 01:33:07,492
This is crazy. This woman
is probably dying as we're talking.

993
01:33:07,663 --> 01:33:09,289
She needs to get to a hospital.

994
01:33:09,458 --> 01:33:13,668
This is not right. We can't just stand here
playing make-believe.

995
01:33:13,837 --> 01:33:16,623
I wanted to believe more than most.

996
01:33:17,215 --> 01:33:19,622
I wanna be like a child again.

997
01:33:20,134 --> 01:33:23,136
I needed to believe there's more
than this awfulness around us...

998
01:33:23,304 --> 01:33:25,012
...but at some point we have to stop.

999
01:33:25,181 --> 01:33:30,341
Mr. Leeds, it is time to prove
some stories are real.

1000
01:33:31,439 --> 01:33:33,476
I read it wrong.

1001
01:33:38,402 --> 01:33:40,145
It was my first time.

1002
01:33:40,319 --> 01:33:43,322
I thought it said, "She will lead
a ceremony of seven sisters...

1003
01:33:43,489 --> 01:33:45,815
...to bring strength to the moment."

1004
01:33:46,493 --> 01:33:50,194
I looked at it again. It says "he."

1005
01:33:50,372 --> 01:33:56,162
"He will lead a ceremony of seven sisters
to bring strength to the moment."

1006
01:33:56,336 --> 01:33:59,622
Mrs. Bell is not the Healer.

1007
01:33:59,797 --> 01:34:02,005
It said the Healer could be a man.

1008
01:34:02,176 --> 01:34:04,713
But I... But I...
I saw a butterfly land right on her.

1009
01:34:04,886 --> 01:34:06,001
Butterflies?

1010
01:34:06,179 --> 01:34:09,631
Yeah, the bedtime story
said butterflies are drawn to the Healer.

1011
01:34:09,807 --> 01:34:12,262
But, Mr. Heep,
you brought that butterfly to me.

1012
01:34:12,435 --> 01:34:15,886
It caught my eye as you walked over.

1013
01:34:18,359 --> 01:34:19,769
I did?

1014
01:34:26,448 --> 01:34:28,274
Wait, no.

1015
01:34:28,451 --> 01:34:30,243
You must try.

1016
01:34:30,411 --> 01:34:33,614
- There's no time.
- I can't. I can't. I can't.

1017
01:34:33,789 --> 01:34:35,367
Shut up...

1018
01:34:36,376 --> 01:34:37,917
...and try.

1019
01:35:19,083 --> 01:35:22,335
Say something to bring out your energy.

1020
01:35:26,341 --> 01:35:29,341
I'm sorry I couldn't protect you.

1021
01:35:35,307 --> 01:35:37,135
I should have been there.

1022
01:35:37,310 --> 01:35:39,635
I am always gonna regret...

1023
01:35:41,771 --> 01:35:44,264
...just not being there.

1024
01:35:49,947 --> 01:35:52,438
I'll miss your faces.

1025
01:35:55,286 --> 01:35:57,954
Oh, they remind me of God.

1026
01:36:04,127 --> 01:36:07,045
I'm so lost without you guys.

I met this very nice lady,
and her name's Story.

1028
01:36:19,518 --> 01:36:21,925
And I think you would've liked her.

1029
01:36:24,814 --> 01:36:27,020
I think she might be...

1030
01:36:28,777 --> 01:36:30,768
...an angel...

1031
01:36:32,988 --> 01:36:35,658
...because she has to go home.

1032
01:36:40,537 --> 01:36:42,695
I love you all.

1033
01:36:44,251 --> 01:36:46,917
I love you all so much.

1034
01:37:32,713 --> 01:37:35,832
Thank you for all you have done.

1035
01:37:47,311 --> 01:37:50,645
Your sister will have seven children.

1036
01:37:50,815 --> 01:37:53,021
You will see the first two.

1037
01:40:08,532 --> 01:40:12,399
Oh, my God. He's the Guardian.

1038
01:40:12,953 --> 01:40:14,198
Reggie!

1039
01:40:14,372 --> 01:40:16,659
Reggie! Reggie,
just keep looking in his eyes!

1040
01:40:16,832 --> 01:40:19,239
Keep looking in his eyes!

1041
01:42:05,438 --> 01:42:08,143
