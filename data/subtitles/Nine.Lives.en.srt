1
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,200
You think this is cute, don't you?

2
00:00:59,299 --> 00:01:02,509
You think there's a real connection there.

3
00:01:02,619 --> 00:01:05,225
So you feed it,

4
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:07,347
you dress it up.

5
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,069
But a cat doesn't care if you live or die

6
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,950
as long as someone
gives it Friskies twice a day.

7
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:29,469
But people are so desperate
for someone to hold onto

8
00:01:29,539 --> 00:01:31,429
they'll take whatever they can get.

9
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:34,905
I found him on the street,
months after the accident

10
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:37,027
and I dress him like Masao.

11
00:01:37,099 --> 00:01:40,661
I know my son has come back
to me in this cat.

12
00:01:40,819 --> 00:01:44,301
But no matter how lonely you are,

13
00:01:44,379 --> 00:01:47,668
a cat is not a person.

14
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,346
Okay. Super helpful, uh...

15
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:15,543
Oh, so marketing wants
sign-off on the new billboard.

16
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:17,905
What do you think?

17
00:02:17,979 --> 00:02:19,868
It might be a little
heavy on the Photoshop.

18
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:20,986
Get me a real F-16.

19
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,106
We'll take some real pictures.

20
00:02:22,219 --> 00:02:23,949
No, they said they don't
have the budget for it.

21
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,384
Fire the marketing department!

22
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,747
You wanna fire the entire
marketing department?

23
00:02:27,819 --> 00:02:30,789
No. I wanna fly a real F-16. What's next?

24
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,509
I'm supposed to remind you,

25
00:02:32,579 --> 00:02:33,819
Lara's left two messages.

26
00:02:33,939 --> 00:02:35,384
Why is she calling?

27
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,985
Because she's your wife.

28
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:39,426
I put together some talking points

29
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,831
for your press conference.

30
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,186
How old are you again?

31
00:02:42,259 --> 00:02:43,307
Twenty-eight.

32
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:44,426
That's how long I've been
talking to the press.

33
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,501
I'll be fine.

34
00:02:45,579 --> 00:02:46,627
Sir, we're ready.

35
00:02:48,579 --> 00:02:50,183
Why don't you jump with me today?

36
00:02:50,259 --> 00:02:52,706
Oh, yeah, no. I just had breakfast, so...

37
00:02:52,819 --> 00:02:53,901
Come on!

38
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,182
Dad, I can't. I can't.

39
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,191
All right.

40
00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:02,062
Chicken!

41
00:03:06,139 --> 00:03:07,664
Good one, Dad.

42
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:26,781
Yeah!

43
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,271
Very nice, very nice!

44
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:30,950
Perfect landing.

45
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,350
Thank you.

46
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,104
Thank you very much. Thank you.

47
00:03:35,379 --> 00:03:36,620
Good morning, everyone.

48
00:03:36,699 --> 00:03:37,860
What an incredible view.

49
00:03:37,939 --> 00:03:40,829
And I mean all of you that I get
to look at this fine morning.

50
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,186
Thank you for coming.

51
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,903
Now, when we open this building

52
00:03:43,979 --> 00:03:45,390
one month from today.

53
00:03:45,579 --> 00:03:48,424
The FireBrand Tower will be the tallest
building in North America.

54
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,860
And that means that we can
finally move out of that dump

55
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:53,102
we've all been forced to work in
all these years down the block.

56
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,341
Tell us about Chicago.

57
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,865
Mr. Brand, any comment
on the Paragon Tower?

58
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,067
Oh, you mean that tin shack
they're gluing together

59
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:00,265
over there in Chicago?

60
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,387
No. No comment on that.

61
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,508
Rumor is they're beating you by 60 feet.

62
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,663
Well, no. There's not a chance of that.

63
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,588
No, no. Look, I'd love to
answer more questions,

64
00:04:07,699 --> 00:04:09,145
but I gotta get back to the office.

65
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:13,783
All right. I wanna move fast here.

66
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,544
Have legal review this overnight.

67
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:17,343
They're all tied up with the tower.

68
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,069
Listen, I know we got to keep him happy,

69
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:21,062
but we can't let this building
distract us from...

70
00:04:21,139 --> 00:04:22,744
Why? You've got something better to do?

71
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,100
Oh.

72
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,420
How was the press conference?

73
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,389
Well, apparently it was a distraction.

74
00:04:27,459 --> 00:04:30,031
I pulled some staff to explore
a public offering.

75
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:32,540
I'm sorry.
Did I ask you to sell my company?

76
00:04:32,659 --> 00:04:33,740
Are we taking bids?

77
00:04:33,819 --> 00:04:34,901
How much can we get for Gary?

78
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,341
We ran some rough numbers...

79
00:04:37,459 --> 00:04:39,622
Yeah. Well, first, why is the press
asking me about Chicago?

80
00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:41,428
You're winning. Yours is bigger.

81
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:44,019
Well, finally there's our new slogan.

82
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,625
Where are we with the opening ceremony?

83
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:47,622
We're gonna rig the entire
building with fireworks.

84
00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:49,709
Oh, so, wait. When I cut the ribbon...

85
00:04:49,779 --> 00:04:50,781
Fireworks go off.

86
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,987
Oh, my God. Ian, that is just spectacular,

87
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,540
you know, if we were doing
a Fourth of July celebration

88
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,064
or a really rousing Oktoberfest.

89
00:04:57,139 --> 00:04:58,221
Tom, we can't keep...

90
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,870
Look, we are just about to cap off

91
00:04:59,939 --> 00:05:01,783
the tallest building
in the Northern Hemisphere

92
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,180
and I can't brag about it
if I don't own it.

93
00:05:04,339 --> 00:05:05,341
Yeah.

94
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,706
This is the distraction.

95
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,826
Okay, everybody,
let's pretend that that didn't just happen.

96
00:05:28,459 --> 00:05:29,699
- What's that?
- It's a surprise.

97
00:05:29,779 --> 00:05:30,781
For my birthday?

98
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,788
- What are you watching?
- Dad.

99
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,144
Did he tell you to record this?

100
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,824
No, but I just wanted to see him.

101
00:05:37,899 --> 00:05:39,026
Look. Watch.

102
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:41,427
And that means that we can
finally move out of that dump

103
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,831
we've all been forced to work in

104
00:05:42,899 --> 00:05:44,425
all these years down the block.

105
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,590
How many times have you watched this?

106
00:05:46,899 --> 00:05:47,867
Um...

107
00:05:47,939 --> 00:05:48,941
Eighty-three.

108
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:50,790
And now it's 84.

109
00:05:51,019 --> 00:05:52,465
We're worried about costs.

110
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,860
Well, that's why we call this
a "Board meeting."

111
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,146
Please take a message.

112
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,221
- Tom, these are serious concerns.
- I know.

113
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,824
- Look, I understand...
- Lara Brand.

114
00:06:03,779 --> 00:06:06,350
- Lara Brand.
- Oh, no, go ahead. Just take it outside.

115
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,747
Ian, where's Tom?
I can't get ahold of him.

116
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:13,470
I can't pry him away from the Board.

117
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:17,430
I wanna show you all that I take
your concerns very seriously.

118
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:20,190
Our operating costs
are up 30% from last quarter.

119
00:06:20,259 --> 00:06:24,470
And my first concern is why is Ian
coming at us with this IPO crap?

120
00:06:24,579 --> 00:06:25,819
He's been with the Board all day?

121
00:06:25,899 --> 00:06:27,105
It's hard to get Tom's attention.

122
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,386
Maybe I should join the Board.

123
00:06:28,459 --> 00:06:30,860
Or you can take my job. Please.

124
00:06:30,939 --> 00:06:32,704
Ian approached us with the idea.

125
00:06:32,779 --> 00:06:34,987
He's put together
a very attractive proposal.

126
00:06:35,139 --> 00:06:37,620
A public offering means
a big payday for all of us.

127
00:06:37,779 --> 00:06:40,624
Now, we've sunk years of revenue
into that building, Tom.

128
00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:41,985
It's time to cash out.

129
00:06:42,139 --> 00:06:44,427
Come on, we got plenty of cash, don't we?

130
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,500
And why?

131
00:06:45,579 --> 00:06:48,470
Because we built airlines and retail
chains and phone companies,

132
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,668
but no one is gonna remember any of those

133
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:52,151
because they keep changing hands.

134
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,903
But 100 years from now,

135
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,459
when people look out their windows
and they see that tower,

136
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,382
they're gonna see the name "Brand"

137
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:00,269
and that's a name they will never forget.

138
00:07:00,339 --> 00:07:03,627
And that is not something
that I am willing to sell.

139
00:07:03,699 --> 00:07:05,827
We're not running a charity
for your ego, Tom.

140
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:08,141
Okay. Well, then instead,
let's play a little game.

141
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,824
You know, just for the fun of it.

142
00:07:10,019 --> 00:07:13,661
Raise your hand if your name
is on the company letterhead.

143
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,668
- Tom...
- No, no. Come on, we'll just call it a vote.

144
00:07:15,819 --> 00:07:18,663
- Tom...
- Fifty-one percent!

145
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,423
Feels good to win.

146
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,184
You can sell shares at my funeral.

147
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:24,547
And the next time Ian wants to play CEO,

148
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:27,901
we can fire him together.

149
00:07:28,379 --> 00:07:30,302
- Hey, can I borrow you for a minute?
- Not now.

150
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,069
It's about the tower.

151
00:07:36,259 --> 00:07:38,466
I already talked to your dad about this.
We're 100 feet taller.

152
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:39,627
I know that's the projection.

153
00:07:39,699 --> 00:07:40,747
But that's printed to scale.

154
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,191
Chicago's beating us by 60.

155
00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:43,420
Am I missing something here? We're taller.

156
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,189
There's too much steel in their roof.

157
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,341
So?

158
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,185
So that's rated for 760 tons,
and there's nothing on it.

159
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:50,545
But if they laid that much steel...

160
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,261
They're not done.

161
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,341
No, that's not in their plans.

162
00:07:54,459 --> 00:07:55,461
They know we have their plans.

163
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,901
They want us to think we're winning
but they got a permit for that

164
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,425
and they are beating us by 60 feet.

165
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,865
David!

166
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,709
Right. Keep this quiet.

167
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:08,190
Oh, Ian, let's make that call
to Madrid before they take their siesta.

168
00:08:08,259 --> 00:08:09,420
Absolutely.

169
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:12,028
You know, we do have janitors.

170
00:08:12,139 --> 00:08:13,903
- Yeah. I've been busy.
- I got you something.

171
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,060
Ow!

172
00:08:23,139 --> 00:08:24,425
Thanks, Dad.

173
00:08:30,819 --> 00:08:33,426
I'm sorry to break up your dinner,
but I need that report.

174
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,501
Well, tell your wife the check's on me.

175
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,264
Yeah, but she gets another
anniversary next year.

176
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,784
I don't really care.

177
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:43,741
Oh, excuse me,
have you seen my wife anywhere?

178
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,025
What does she look like?

179
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:49,344
She is the most beautiful woman
in the entire world.

180
00:08:49,419 --> 00:08:51,548
Oh, well, maybe I have seen her.
Let me see.

181
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:55,067
Oh, here we go. Is this her?

182
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,350
Oh, let's give her a call.

183
00:08:57,419 --> 00:08:59,865
Yeah, it was a busy day. What did I miss?

184
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,424
Uh, my birthday was last month.

185
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,110
You're joking me right now?

186
00:09:04,299 --> 00:09:06,268
You're gonna have to give me
more to work with than that.

187
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,542
- Oh, damn it. It's not today?
- Tomorrow.

188
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,030
Oh, well, then I haven't missed it.

189
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,544
Father of the year.

190
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,985
So, what did we get her?

191
00:09:15,059 --> 00:09:16,186
Oh, we didn't get her anything.

192
00:09:16,299 --> 00:09:20,225
You were too busy to talk for five minutes,
so I got her a makeup kit.

193
00:09:20,379 --> 00:09:23,428
Oh, well, couldn't we say that
the makeup kit's from both of us?

194
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,423
- No.
- Fine.

195
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:26,626
What should I get her?

196
00:09:27,259 --> 00:09:29,500
Maybe you should ask her what she wants.

197
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,070
Try getting to know her a little bit

198
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:32,585
before she heads off to college.

199
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,663
Come on. I still got seven years left.

200
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,788
Or, no, six years. I'm kidding.

201
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:38,350
Is this how you raised David?

202
00:09:38,419 --> 00:09:40,024
- My son turned out just fine.
- Mmm.

203
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,148
He had to apply for a job to see his dad.

204
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,664
Well, of course.
His mother got full custody.

205
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:44,740
I had a terrible lawyer.

206
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,230
When you come to Rebecca's party...

207
00:09:46,299 --> 00:09:48,701
Look, we are a month away from opening
the tallest building in...

208
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:51,431
Tom! When you come to Rebecca's party,

209
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,470
you gotta be here and you have
to bring an exceptional gift.

210
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:55,661
Daddy!

211
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,947
Hey, baby.

212
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:00,791
Oh, my goodness.
Those are such fancy pajamas.

213
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:01,860
Yeah, aren't they?

214
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,424
- They're not pajamas.
- They're not?

215
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,389
But isn't it your bedtime?
What time is her bedtime?

216
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,985
She's coming with us.

217
00:10:07,179 --> 00:10:08,466
Mom says I get to meet the Mayor.

218
00:10:08,539 --> 00:10:09,541
Really?

219
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:11,863
Quality father-daughter bonding time.

220
00:10:12,659 --> 00:10:14,184
Will there be food?

221
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,421
It's $10,000 a plate.

222
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,500
You're gonna eat like a queen.

223
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,990
Will there be pizza?

224
00:10:18,059 --> 00:10:20,107
Yes, $10,000 pizza.

225
00:10:23,899 --> 00:10:26,870
The children's fund has thrived
under the Mayor's leadership.

226
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:29,745
And to make sure Mayor Edwards
gets something out of it,

227
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,548
he's gonna lower the voting age to ten.

228
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:35,301
Everyone asks me why my husband

229
00:10:35,419 --> 00:10:37,548
is hosting a charity event.

230
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,020
The truth is Tom loves children.

231
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,142
He says they make the best smartphones.

232
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:43,860
I don't get it.

233
00:10:43,899 --> 00:10:45,424
- She just burned your dad.
- Oh.

234
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,264
They say there is no substitute

235
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,943
for time with your children.

236
00:10:49,059 --> 00:10:51,984
Although, we know, in this room,
money comes close.

237
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:56,426
And that's why this charity is so popular.

238
00:10:56,539 --> 00:10:57,951
If you don't have time for kids,

239
00:10:58,019 --> 00:10:59,544
we'll ease your guilt
by taking your dough.

240
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:04,461
Which is why Tom Brand has agreed
to host this benefit

241
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:06,621
for the next seven years.

242
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,509
So without further ado,
please welcome my husband,

243
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,548
a real pussy cat, Tom Brand.

244
00:11:18,019 --> 00:11:19,988
So, today is the big day.

245
00:11:20,059 --> 00:11:21,471
Have you thought about what you want?

246
00:11:21,539 --> 00:11:22,666
I want a cat.

247
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:23,980
Oh, I don't think our building takes pets.

248
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:25,221
You own the building.

249
00:11:25,299 --> 00:11:26,711
Wait, didn't you ask for a cat last year?

250
00:11:26,779 --> 00:11:28,668
Yeah, and you got me a foosball table.

251
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,548
Honey, most kids would kill
for a foosball table.

252
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,224
Yeah, but none of my friends
play foosball.

253
00:11:32,299 --> 00:11:34,381
So, at least if I have a cat,
I can play with the cat.

254
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,985
All right, all right.
I'll make you a deal.

255
00:11:36,059 --> 00:11:38,380
- I will think about it. How about that?
- Yes!

256
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:42,071
Get her jewelry. Girls love jewelry.

257
00:11:42,139 --> 00:11:43,140
Pull some strings with Apple,

258
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,745
get her a prototype of the new iPhone.

259
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:45,866
How about a private concert?

260
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,429
- You know what band she is into?
- No.

261
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,911
I have a radical suggestion.

262
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,709
Have you tried asking Rebecca
what she wants?

263
00:11:50,779 --> 00:11:52,748
Yes, she wants a cat.

264
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:53,980
Well, that's in your price range.

265
00:11:54,059 --> 00:11:55,186
I hate cats.

266
00:11:55,259 --> 00:11:57,261
They puke all over the house.
They shed all over everything.

267
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,149
I got an ex-wife, a wife and two kids,

268
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,426
I don't need another thing to feed.

269
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,065
What about a pony?

270
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:12,143
Could you smile? It's a party.

271
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,380
Why do we always come here?

272
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:15,269
They're family. More or less.

273
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:18,346
What are you barking at?
There are no squirrels in the elevator.

274
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:21,664
Here, take him.

275
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,029
Just pretend you're having fun.

276
00:12:26,139 --> 00:12:28,062
Seriously?

277
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,423
Happy birthday!

278
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,822
I love this yearly ritual

279
00:12:37,899 --> 00:12:39,629
where Tom forgets Rebecca's birthdays

280
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,100
and you forget that Tom
forgets Rebecca's birthdays.

281
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:43,226
He kind of remembered.

282
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,581
- You'd have to fire a warning shot.
- Madison!

283
00:12:45,659 --> 00:12:47,866
When Tom and I divorced,
he got the younger model.

284
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,066
I'm blushing.

285
00:12:49,179 --> 00:12:50,750
If he loses you, it's jailbait.

286
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,105
Well, that's romantic.

287
00:12:52,179 --> 00:12:54,581
I want you to call my lawyer.

288
00:12:54,659 --> 00:12:56,230
Do you get a finder's fee?

289
00:12:56,299 --> 00:12:58,347
Lara, the day Tom and I divorced

290
00:12:58,419 --> 00:12:59,990
was the happiest day of my life.

291
00:13:00,059 --> 00:13:02,107
I want that happiness for you.

292
00:13:02,179 --> 00:13:04,386
Come on, help me out before
your hands get all shaky.

293
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:08,469
This is for the road.
I don't want Tom catching us together.

294
00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:10,780
What's he gonna do? Divorce you again?

295
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,865
He would if he could.

296
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,866
Are there gonna be any boys at the party?

297
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,509
No.

298
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:20,144
You're turning 11, Rebecca.

299
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,951
Now's the time.
I could help you, you know.

300
00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:24,828
Like how my mom helps your mom.

301
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:26,708
- What?
- Never mind.

302
00:13:26,779 --> 00:13:27,860
I love your room.

303
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,100
Thank you.

304
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,948
My dad actually likes
spending time with me,

305
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:33,022
so he never has to buy me off.

306
00:13:34,379 --> 00:13:37,065
Come on. Smile for Instagram.

307
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,264
What if you got her a plush cat?

308
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:43,750
See, technically, it's a cat.

309
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,225
No, technically, it's not a cat.

310
00:13:45,539 --> 00:13:46,985
Chicago just announced.

311
00:13:47,299 --> 00:13:49,302
Hang on. I got it, I got it, I got it.

312
00:13:49,379 --> 00:13:51,780
Take a look at Tashirojima,

313
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,988
also known as Cat Island.

314
00:13:54,059 --> 00:13:55,299
Put her up there with a nanny.

315
00:13:55,379 --> 00:13:57,109
Best part, you don't
even have to be there.

316
00:13:57,179 --> 00:13:58,147
That's interesting.

317
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,426
She asks for a cat every single year.

318
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:00,666
You can't just buy your way out.

319
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,504
Mr. Brand, I think the fact that

320
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:04,183
you've had us put so much time
and thought into this

321
00:14:04,259 --> 00:14:05,591
is really gonna show her you care.

322
00:14:05,659 --> 00:14:06,946
If you wanna show her you really care,

323
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:08,259
just get her what she really wants.

324
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,469
A cat.

325
00:14:11,539 --> 00:14:13,224
Jeez.

326
00:14:29,659 --> 00:14:32,981
Nearest pet shop, 1.7 miles.

327
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:40,821
Damn it.

328
00:14:40,899 --> 00:14:42,061
Recalculating.

329
00:14:43,899 --> 00:14:47,790
In one-tenth of a mile, make a right turn.

330
00:14:53,419 --> 00:14:55,149
Make a left turn.

331
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,985
You have arrived.

332
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:08,020
Jeez!

333
00:16:05,139 --> 00:16:06,551
Get away from me.

334
00:16:08,059 --> 00:16:09,061
Shut up.

335
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:12,145
Hello? Hello?

336
00:16:15,019 --> 00:16:16,749
- Oh, hello.
- Hi.

337
00:16:20,419 --> 00:16:22,308
You look familiar. Have we met?

338
00:16:22,379 --> 00:16:23,541
Oh, I doubt it.

339
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,349
I know you from somewhere.

340
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:27,188
Well, I'm on TV a lot.

341
00:16:27,259 --> 00:16:29,661
Yes! Animal Planet. I love that show.

342
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:30,946
No, not Animal Planet.

343
00:16:31,059 --> 00:16:34,029
- I'm Tom Brand. I own FireBrand.
- There you go.

344
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,500
I use newspaper in the poopy boxes,

345
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,980
and I see your face all the time.

346
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,179
Look, I'm a little late for something,

347
00:16:41,259 --> 00:16:43,024
so if we could just get on with it?

348
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:45,221
- Meow!
- Sure.

349
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:46,984
You don't like cats, do you, Mr. Brand?

350
00:16:47,059 --> 00:16:48,823
Look, can I just pick one out?
And then I'll be on my way.

351
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:50,902
You don't pick a cat. The cat picks you.

352
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,663
Look, I make million-dollar
decisions for lunch.

353
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,071
I'm pretty sure I can pick out a cat.

354
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:55,982
See that? He likes you.

355
00:16:56,059 --> 00:16:59,381
It figures because he's
attracted to troubled souls.

356
00:17:01,419 --> 00:17:03,104
Used up seven lives already.

357
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:06,548
Meow, meow, meow,
meow, meow, meow, meow, meow

358
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:09,191
Meow, meow, meow, meow Meow, meow, meow

359
00:17:09,539 --> 00:17:12,749
That'll give Chicago the tallest
building in North America

360
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:15,103
which leaves New York
and FireBrand in second place.

361
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,864
You should pick a bowl.

362
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:18,145
The company could not
be reached for comment.

363
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:20,108
But with the opening ceremony
just a month away...

364
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,909
"Mister Fuzzypants."

365
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:24,631
Yeah. Yeah. Good.

366
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,180
Good choice.

367
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,070
Yeah. Could you just wrap it up for me?

368
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,186
Sure.

369
00:17:30,779 --> 00:17:32,111
You know, I get it.

370
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:34,625
"Brand" because your name is Brand.

371
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:38,382
- But why "Fire"?
- How much do I owe you?

372
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,905
I ask because I did the same thing, see.

373
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:44,189
My name is Perkins,

374
00:17:44,259 --> 00:17:48,151
so I call my store "Purrkins."

375
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:50,871
Oh, I see there.

376
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,945
We're just like two peas in a pod.

377
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,425
Yeah. Keep the change.

378
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,026
Oh, wow.

379
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:04,109
- You might not wanna take that.
- I'm sorry?

380
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,784
You're running late, it's a gift.

381
00:18:05,859 --> 00:18:07,099
You don't want to be late.

382
00:18:09,779 --> 00:18:11,862
For the party?

383
00:18:16,339 --> 00:18:17,340
Right.

384
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,743
Ian, what the hell is going on?

385
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:25,824
Okay, cats.

386
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,142
Let's do this.

387
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,825
Oh, good job.

388
00:18:35,339 --> 00:18:37,387
- Happy birthday, baby.
- Thank you.

389
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,029
Okay, first piece for the birthday girl.

390
00:18:39,099 --> 00:18:40,464
And save some for Daddy.

391
00:18:40,539 --> 00:18:42,906
Just put it in the freezer
next to last year's slice.

392
00:18:43,019 --> 00:18:44,863
- Mmm.
- What?

393
00:18:50,779 --> 00:18:52,111
Wait here.

394
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,224
Shut up.

395
00:19:28,059 --> 00:19:29,185
Went with the cat.

396
00:19:29,259 --> 00:19:30,307
Smart move.

397
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,790
Was that news report a joke?

398
00:19:31,859 --> 00:19:33,544
Tom, we can turn this around.

399
00:19:33,619 --> 00:19:34,701
Just look up there.

400
00:19:34,779 --> 00:19:36,191
That antenna's 47 feet.

401
00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:37,385
I spoke to our engineers,

402
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:39,780
and if we install support lines,
we can raise it up.

403
00:19:39,859 --> 00:19:40,941
That's what they did at One World Trade.

404
00:19:41,019 --> 00:19:42,749
Stop. You dragged me across town

405
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,628
and up 1,900 feet to tell me this?

406
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,701
This is a solution.

407
00:19:45,779 --> 00:19:47,269
- That antenna is...
- Antenna?

408
00:19:47,339 --> 00:19:49,865
I wanted the tallest building,
Ian, not the best reception.

409
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,351
Well, maybe we can add more floors.

410
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,830
Do you know how much planning
went into this?

411
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,470
To get permission to build it this height?

412
00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:56,065
You blew it. We're now standing

413
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,630
on the second tallest
building in North America.

414
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,588
Number two, because you were busy

415
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,708
trying to sell my company behind my back.

416
00:20:01,819 --> 00:20:03,151
- Tom...
- Pack up your office!

417
00:20:04,539 --> 00:20:06,109
I'm late. I know. Stop calling.

418
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,710
- Pull me up.
- You're firing me?

419
00:20:23,779 --> 00:20:24,780
Take my hand!

420
00:20:43,779 --> 00:20:45,144
That hurt.

421
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,740
BP holding steady.

422
00:20:48,819 --> 00:20:50,151
Okay, let's do this on three.

423
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,221
Ready?

424
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:53,301
One, two, three.

425
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,949
What about that guy?

426
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:03,063
Huh, this little guy looks fine.

427
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,431
Wow, that guy looks worse off than me.

428
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,151
And he's wearing my clothes.

429
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,788
And that's my belt.

430
00:21:19,859 --> 00:21:21,224
Seriously?

431
00:21:25,259 --> 00:21:27,182
It's just a bad dream!

432
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,105
The good news is your husband made it

433
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,909
through surgery with no complications,

434
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:37,346
but he had severe head trauma
and is unresponsive.

435
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,023
You call this unresponsive?

436
00:21:39,619 --> 00:21:40,746
When will he wake up?

437
00:21:40,819 --> 00:21:42,230
Mrs. Brand, your husband's in a coma.

438
00:21:42,299 --> 00:21:45,462
Once the swelling in the brain is
reduced over the next couple of days,

439
00:21:45,539 --> 00:21:47,508
that's when we're more likely
to see a recovery.

440
00:21:47,579 --> 00:21:48,990
But right now, he's not in there.

441
00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:50,346
That's because I'm in here!

442
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:52,262
Lara, listen to me! It's me!

443
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:56,904
Thank God. You can hear me.

444
00:21:58,539 --> 00:22:00,348
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

445
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,500
No, no, no, no.

446
00:22:01,579 --> 00:22:03,308
Don't leave me back there.

447
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:05,428
Hey, leave me with me.

448
00:22:09,579 --> 00:22:10,626
Hi.

449
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,460
Hi, baby.

450
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,425
Can I see Daddy?

451
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,742
Well, he is sleeping right now
so he can't talk to us,

452
00:22:18,819 --> 00:22:20,584
but maybe he can hear us.

453
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,150
We'll go in together, okay?

454
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,710
- Come on.
- Shall we see?

455
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,548
Oh, this is so humiliating.

456
00:22:26,619 --> 00:22:27,984
Hey, Lara. I tried to lift him up,

457
00:22:28,059 --> 00:22:29,185
but I wasn't strong enough.

458
00:22:29,299 --> 00:22:30,664
- Judas.
- No, it's not your fault.

459
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:31,980
Whose cat is that?

460
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:33,346
I think he's yours.

461
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,990
I think your dad got him. Let's go see.

462
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,501
Daddy got me a cat?

463
00:22:37,579 --> 00:22:39,263
Amazing, isn't it?

464
00:22:49,099 --> 00:22:50,146
I said I'd call.

465
00:22:59,099 --> 00:23:00,864
Hello, someone, anyone.

466
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:03,340
I'm trapped inside a cat's body.

467
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,700
Somebody help me!

468
00:23:04,779 --> 00:23:07,259
You, in the horrible green jacket.

469
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,503
So, how are you doin' in there?

470
00:23:13,579 --> 00:23:15,548
The nightmare continues.

471
00:23:15,619 --> 00:23:17,861
Mr. Brand, this is no dream.

472
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,351
- You can hear me?
- Shh.

473
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,262
I'm a cat whisperer.

474
00:23:21,339 --> 00:23:23,387
And I'm the only one who can hear you.

475
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:24,621
What did you do to me?

476
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,701
I didn't do anything. You fell off a roof.

477
00:23:26,779 --> 00:23:28,430
Fine. How do I get out of this?

478
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,944
Wrong question.

479
00:23:30,019 --> 00:23:32,500
You should ask, "How did I get into this?"

480
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:34,183
Fine! How did I get into this?

481
00:23:34,259 --> 00:23:35,829
Keep asking that question.

482
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,390
I hope you figure it out.

483
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:39,064
What does that mean?

484
00:23:39,579 --> 00:23:40,786
Your body won't last long.

485
00:23:40,859 --> 00:23:43,625
If it expires, you're gonna
be stuck in there

486
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,030
for the rest of your life.

487
00:23:45,099 --> 00:23:46,589
You get me out of here, you son of a...

488
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:47,990
Calm down, Mr. Brand.

489
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:49,585
You're a cat.

490
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,391
It's not the end of the world.

491
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,269
I hate cats.

492
00:23:53,339 --> 00:23:55,468
That's what makes this so perfect.

493
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,625
All right.

494
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,429
Calm down.

495
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:03,151
I thought Daddy would get me a kitten.

496
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:04,664
He is scruffy, isn't he?

497
00:24:05,339 --> 00:24:06,865
What, you want to trade him in.

498
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:07,980
No!

499
00:24:08,059 --> 00:24:09,585
I didn't think so.

500
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,741
All right, welcome home, cat.

501
00:24:11,859 --> 00:24:12,861
Oh.

502
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,503
Maybe we should let him get comfortable.

503
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:18,345
He wants to explore.

504
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,945
Can I sleep with you tonight, Mommy?

505
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,065
Yeah, kiddo.

506
00:24:24,019 --> 00:24:25,784
I could use the company.

507
00:24:25,859 --> 00:24:28,545
Message. Let them know I'm me.

508
00:24:28,619 --> 00:24:29,666
Write a message.

509
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:31,105
Simple.

510
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:33,228
"Oh, hi, it's Tom.

511
00:24:33,339 --> 00:24:34,625
"Get me out of here."

512
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:38,465
Just need a few words.

513
00:24:38,539 --> 00:24:40,029
Nothing complicated.

514
00:25:17,579 --> 00:25:20,026
Dear Lara, don't panic. It's Tom.

515
00:25:20,099 --> 00:25:22,467
I seem to be trapped in the body of a cat.

516
00:25:22,539 --> 00:25:23,701
This is not a joke.

517
00:25:23,779 --> 00:25:25,862
Your loving husband, Tom.

518
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,505
Okay, that didn't work.

519
00:25:30,579 --> 00:25:32,901
Although, not bad for a cat.

520
00:25:45,779 --> 00:25:48,942
Ironically, I could really
use a mouse right now.

521
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:58,980
Mommy, when is Daddy gonna come home?

522
00:25:59,059 --> 00:26:00,505
Just as soon as he wakes up.

523
00:26:00,619 --> 00:26:02,941
They should use a really big alarm clock.

524
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:04,942
You'd be a great doctor.

525
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,421
What do you want, kitty?

526
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:26,060
Money clip, plus license equals...

527
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,380
I'm stuck in a cat!

528
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,825
He wants to play.

529
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:33,871
Well, sorry, kitty. It is bedtime in here.

530
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:35,624
But we can play tomorrow.

531
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:36,780
Tomorrow?

532
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,580
Okay.

533
00:26:47,259 --> 00:26:48,785
Where were we?

534
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:46,748
If I'm in a cat's body,

535
00:28:46,819 --> 00:28:49,141
is a cat in my body?

536
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:52,230
Oh...

537
00:28:52,299 --> 00:28:54,461
I always hated that rug.

538
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,701
Whoa!

539
00:28:58,539 --> 00:29:00,304
This is good scotch.

540
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:26,901
Rough night?

541
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,868
No. I was just contemplating

542
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:31,625
the rest of my life as a cat.

543
00:29:32,619 --> 00:29:33,621
Hmm.

544
00:29:40,059 --> 00:29:41,788
Okay.

545
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,549
Jesus!

546
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,344
Who's hungry?

547
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,500
Oh...

548
00:29:55,019 --> 00:29:56,020
Yum yum.

549
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:04,261
Looks like a cat already ate this.

550
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:06,064
Bon appétit.

551
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:08,107
French. That'll sell this stuff.

552
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:17,711
All right.

553
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,145
There's your litter box.

554
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,063
No, thank you, I have the rug.

555
00:30:36,099 --> 00:30:38,147
I had a really good excuse.

556
00:30:40,099 --> 00:30:42,102
Here come the floodgates.

557
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:48,471
You probably think I'm crazy
crying over a piece of cake.

558
00:30:48,539 --> 00:30:51,019
Or that your husband's
in the hospital in a coma.

559
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:52,864
He's gonna wake up.

560
00:30:53,779 --> 00:30:54,826
Right?

561
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:57,780
Oh, I really gotta find that Perkins guy.

562
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:02,990
Hangover!

563
00:31:05,099 --> 00:31:06,625
Hello, kitty.

564
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:08,305
What should we call you?

565
00:31:09,819 --> 00:31:12,391
Is that your name? Mister Fuzzypants?

566
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:13,790
I hate karma.

567
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:16,425
You're the best gift I ever got.

568
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,944
No, too sweet.

569
00:31:20,059 --> 00:31:21,788
That wasn't funny.

570
00:31:23,619 --> 00:31:25,144
What are you two laughing at?

571
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:27,382
I don't think it's funny.

572
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:28,665
See, this is my point of view.

573
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:31,549
We don't need high rises,
we need strategic growth.

574
00:31:31,619 --> 00:31:32,859
And that's what we've all been saying.

575
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:35,181
We shouldn't even be
talking about this now.

576
00:31:35,259 --> 00:31:36,500
This isn't a crisis.

577
00:31:36,579 --> 00:31:38,263
This is an opportunity.

578
00:31:55,619 --> 00:31:56,666
What?

579
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,625
What do you need?

580
00:32:14,819 --> 00:32:16,788
If you want food, it's in the bowl.

581
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:22,540
Fruity Pebbles

582
00:32:23,539 --> 00:32:26,191
or that?

583
00:32:29,539 --> 00:32:30,621
Fruity Pebbles.

584
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:41,307
Be the cat, be the cat, be the cat,
be the cat, be the cat!

585
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:44,901
Graceful.

586
00:32:46,019 --> 00:32:47,351
Yeah? You try it.

587
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:04,828
And, nailed it!

588
00:33:05,619 --> 00:33:06,666
I called your mom, too.

589
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:08,344
I just wanted to get everyone together.

590
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,625
Well, it smells great.

591
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:11,349
What are you cooking?

592
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:14,823
Roast cat.

593
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:17,228
Maybe its head got screwed up in the fall.

594
00:33:17,299 --> 00:33:18,825
He's an alcoholic. I can't get him to eat,

595
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,140
but I found an empty decanter,

596
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:22,108
of 50-year-old Macallan
with fur all over it.

597
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,829
Well, at least he has good taste.

598
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:26,141
Maybe I should mix scotch into his food.

599
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,346
Can I use Dad's office for a bit?

600
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,467
Yeah, what's up?

601
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:30,190
I just want to see
if I can find anything else

602
00:33:30,259 --> 00:33:32,148
that might help me
with this whole Chicago...

603
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:36,028
Do they make MRIs for cats?

604
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,904
You mean CAT scans?

605
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:40,903
I should have landed on the knives.

606
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:44,111
I'll be in the office.

607
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,230
Hi.

608
00:33:59,539 --> 00:34:00,586
So,

609
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:02,030
are you like Dad now?

610
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:03,507
What do you mean?

611
00:34:03,619 --> 00:34:05,030
Are you president of the company?

612
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:08,550
No, I'm doing the same job,
just without Dad.

613
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:10,545
Can you come out soon?

614
00:34:10,619 --> 00:34:12,110
Yeah, in a minute.

615
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:14,422
You're so totally like Dad.

616
00:34:18,539 --> 00:34:19,826
Lara!

617
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:22,266
Oh, good! Satan's over for dinner.

618
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:25,864
So sorry about Tom.
I always thought it would be skydiving,

619
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,385
or that his secretary would just snap

620
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:28,949
and bring an Uzi to the office.

621
00:34:29,099 --> 00:34:31,306
I thought you'd die from a Botox overdose.

622
00:34:31,579 --> 00:34:33,230
Oh, you brought the dogs.

623
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:35,784
Princess, Jeanette!

624
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:49,349
You know Tom's unconscious, right?
You can take the night off.

625
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,342
Yeah, well, someone
has to keep things going.

626
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:53,940
I never understood why you wanted
to work for him anyway.

627
00:34:54,019 --> 00:34:55,862
- Mom, if we could not talk...
- Hey.

628
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:57,987
This isn't healthy.

629
00:35:15,619 --> 00:35:17,269
Chicken soup for grief.

630
00:35:20,059 --> 00:35:21,505
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

631
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,351
Stop it. Get out of here.

632
00:35:33,179 --> 00:35:34,181
Heel!

633
00:35:35,539 --> 00:35:37,702
Can you please take them away?
They're really scaring him.

634
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:40,306
They have a very strong sense
about other animals.

635
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,382
- Where'd your dad get him?
- Why?

636
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:44,507
Well, did he just
pick him up off the streets?

637
00:35:44,579 --> 00:35:46,264
He's just a little messy.

638
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:48,507
I know you're upset
because your dad's dying...

639
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:51,385
He's not dying. He's just unconscious.

640
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:54,389
My mom says your mom should be
more realistic about his condition.

641
00:35:56,139 --> 00:35:57,903
Princess, Jeanette, heel!

642
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:01,344
T

643
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:03,663
O

644
00:36:04,059 --> 00:36:05,221
M.

645
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:10,384
Madison, David, Rebecca, Nicole.

646
00:36:11,619 --> 00:36:12,621
What?

647
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,186
I set a place for Tom.

648
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:17,748
Well, that's a weird habit.
It's not like he's usually here for dinner.

649
00:36:18,099 --> 00:36:19,545
Madison, not tonight.

650
00:36:19,739 --> 00:36:21,981
I'd say the same thing if he were here.

651
00:36:22,059 --> 00:36:23,505
Yes, that's why nobody likes you.

652
00:36:23,579 --> 00:36:25,661
But there's a reason
you've been seeing Josh.

653
00:36:25,739 --> 00:36:26,786
Josh?

654
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,510
Oh, I can't even think
about that right now.

655
00:36:28,579 --> 00:36:31,663
Now's the perfect time.
It's not like Tom could catch you.

656
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:35,905
Who needs a litter box?

657
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:50,182
Oh, Madison? I've been a bad kitty.

658
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,429
Hey! You...

659
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:58,626
Oh...

660
00:36:59,059 --> 00:37:00,471
Cheese!

661
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:14,384
Sorry, everybody.

662
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,347
- Wait.
- What?

663
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:19,300
Nothing, I just thought
I saw... Nothing. It's okay.

664
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,581
Lara, that cat needs to be put down.

665
00:37:21,659 --> 00:37:22,661
Hey!

666
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:24,059
I'll buy you a new bag, Madison.

667
00:37:24,139 --> 00:37:27,268
Hire a trainer,
a cat whisperer, I don't care.

668
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,664
Let's get you a new martini.

669
00:37:30,019 --> 00:37:31,101
Yes.

670
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:34,382
Well, someone's gotta talk
about the empty chair.

671
00:37:35,139 --> 00:37:37,541
- Should we do toasts?
- It's not a wake, Mom.

672
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,827
This isn't Tom's
first time in the hospital.

673
00:37:40,139 --> 00:37:41,983
Remember when he launched the airline?

674
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:44,108
He was always on the phone, never slept.

675
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:45,420
You know what you asked me?

676
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,547
Vampire.

677
00:37:46,619 --> 00:37:48,269
Why is Daddy a vampire?

678
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,867
Because Mommy sucked all his blood.

679
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,668
He'd stay awake all night working out,

680
00:37:52,739 --> 00:37:55,425
and then one day, he just fell
asleep on a moving treadmill.

681
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,228
He was in the hospital for a week.

682
00:37:57,619 --> 00:37:59,304
Best vacation I ever had.

683
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:01,347
I'd wake up and find him
on the balcony at 4:00 a.m.

684
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:03,262
just staring at his tower.

685
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:04,387
I'll say this for Tom.

686
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:05,621
There was never another woman.

687
00:38:05,699 --> 00:38:06,860
With me, it was an airline.

688
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:08,942
With you, it's a big skyscraper.

689
00:38:09,019 --> 00:38:10,431
Ignore everything you hear tonight.

690
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:12,463
I'm not a role model, Rebecca.

691
00:38:12,539 --> 00:38:13,871
You're used to it.

692
00:38:14,099 --> 00:38:15,704
- How about that toast?
- Mmm-hmm.

693
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:18,181
- To Dad. Wake up soon.
- We miss you.

694
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:19,864
Or your tower misses you.

695
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:35,744
Sleep well?

696
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:40,262
Rebecca Alison Brand,
your cat destroyed the yellow pages!

697
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:42,030
What's a yellow pages?

698
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:10,344
That cat you got,

699
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:11,387
he's lucky you're in here

700
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:13,110
or you'd have killed him by now.

701
00:39:13,219 --> 00:39:14,505
I got a plan to beat Chicago.

702
00:39:14,579 --> 00:39:16,422
I just need to sell it to the Board.

703
00:39:16,739 --> 00:39:19,141
When you wake up, we might be number one.

704
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,706
We're doing the best that we can do.

705
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:23,384
Okay. Thank you so much.

706
00:39:29,179 --> 00:39:30,420
What are you doing here?

707
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,786
Sprained my wrist. That's why
I couldn't hold on to your Dad.

708
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:34,782
You're seeing my Dad's neurologist
about your wrist?

709
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:36,021
The Board needs updates on his status.

710
00:39:36,099 --> 00:39:37,260
So ask me.

711
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:39,661
We're not going to take medical
advice from the grieving son.

712
00:39:39,739 --> 00:39:40,980
It's a massive transition for the company.

713
00:39:41,059 --> 00:39:42,186
What transition?

714
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:44,706
Big day at the office.
Good luck with the Board.

715
00:39:47,099 --> 00:39:48,385
We're losing by that much.

716
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:49,905
We get 70 feet, we're number one.

717
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:52,061
Now, our structure
can't support another floor,

718
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:55,507
and unfortunately we can't just
smuggle a wrecking ball into Chicago,

719
00:39:55,579 --> 00:39:57,150
so we need to shed weight.

720
00:39:57,219 --> 00:39:58,346
I thought we were making it taller.

721
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:00,465
We lose one floor,

722
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:02,065
it buys us this.

723
00:40:02,139 --> 00:40:03,380
That's gonna collapse.

724
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:04,585
Not if we use titanium.

725
00:40:04,659 --> 00:40:05,865
Why don't we just build it out of gold?

726
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,822
It's as strong as steel
and half the weight.

727
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:10,260
I don't know what problem
you're trying to solve here.

728
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:11,340
Excuse me?

729
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:13,746
This is a stack of prime real
estate in Manhattan.

730
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:15,231
We can't charge rent on a jungle gym.

731
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:16,983
My father didn't build
the tallest skyscraper

732
00:40:17,059 --> 00:40:19,188
in the Northern Hemisphere
for a little rent money.

733
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:20,670
It's not the tallest skyscraper.

734
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:22,231
Because you screwed up.

735
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:23,300
Hmm.

736
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:29,670
Look. If Tom were here, you know
this is exactly what he would do.

737
00:40:29,739 --> 00:40:32,744
I appreciate that you want
to honor your father, David.

738
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:33,981
We need to watch the books.

739
00:40:34,059 --> 00:40:37,347
Our company can't keep diverting
funds into Tom's pet projects.

740
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:38,985
It's his company.

741
00:40:39,059 --> 00:40:40,106
Thank you, David.

742
00:40:40,659 --> 00:40:42,184
He's not dead.

743
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:56,623
- Meow.
- Meow.

744
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:57,947
You wanna try?

745
00:40:58,019 --> 00:40:59,021
You wanna try?

746
00:40:59,099 --> 00:41:00,340
Lord help me.

747
00:41:01,099 --> 00:41:04,626
Okay, let's try "A purse
is not a litter box."

748
00:41:05,179 --> 00:41:07,103
A purse is not a litter box.

749
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:12,786
Mr. Fuzzypants was the last thing
her father gave her,

750
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:14,349
so she's really latched on.

751
00:41:14,539 --> 00:41:17,224
Mmm. He wants attention, obviously.

752
00:41:17,539 --> 00:41:19,382
- This is our daughter, Rebecca.
- Hello.

753
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:21,548
You are going to tell
them every word I say.

754
00:41:24,659 --> 00:41:25,865
Good move. Nice.

755
00:41:26,139 --> 00:41:27,300
You try it.

756
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:30,190
Your dad bought this cat at my store.
Did you know that?

757
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:31,989
Who cares? Just translate.

758
00:41:32,059 --> 00:41:35,222
I remember, he said he wanted you
to have exactly what you asked for.

759
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:38,184
Hey, cat freak, I didn't call you
down here to ignore me.

760
00:41:39,019 --> 00:41:41,260
Could we have a moment of privacy, please?

761
00:41:43,139 --> 00:41:44,300
You and the cat?

762
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:45,380
- Yeah.
- Okay.

763
00:41:52,139 --> 00:41:54,380
You don't have time for games, Mr. Brand.

764
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:55,949
Tell them who I am.

765
00:41:56,019 --> 00:41:57,590
I'm not your press agent.

766
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:01,505
Well, you're a cat whisperer,

767
00:42:01,579 --> 00:42:03,581
and I'm pretty sure I'm still a cat!

768
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:07,501
Have you asked yourself

769
00:42:07,579 --> 00:42:09,150
how you got into this position?

770
00:42:09,219 --> 00:42:10,380
I tried googling it, but you know,

771
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:12,507
they don't make keyboards for paws!

772
00:42:12,579 --> 00:42:15,628
You're acting like a beast
and you're driving your family crazy.

773
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:18,385
These doctors can't
keep you alive forever,

774
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:22,101
so if you want to get out of this,
you have to behave.

775
00:42:22,699 --> 00:42:25,431
And if your human body goes,
get used to those paws.

776
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,103
You'll be a cat forever.

777
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,467
I am not eating cat food.

778
00:42:33,739 --> 00:42:35,230
You'll eat cat food or else.

779
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:37,023
Oh, I'm 10 pounds and covered in fur.

780
00:42:37,099 --> 00:42:38,864
What else could you possibly do to me?

781
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:40,829
This cat has not been fixed.

782
00:42:41,219 --> 00:42:42,266
Don't you dare.

783
00:42:42,739 --> 00:42:44,867
Oh, should I take him to the vet?

784
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:46,179
- Perkins...
- Let's wait.

785
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:47,864
- ...if you so much as lay a finger on...
- He's made progress.

786
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,668
He's gonna be better now.

787
00:42:49,739 --> 00:42:52,630
If he's not eating his food,
using his poopy box,

788
00:42:53,019 --> 00:42:55,306
give me a call. I'll clip him myself.

789
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:56,621
You hear that, Fuzzypants?

790
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:58,940
I am the sixth richest
person in Manhattan!

791
00:42:59,019 --> 00:43:00,067
A well-behaved pet

792
00:43:00,139 --> 00:43:02,141
brings love and comfort to a home.

793
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:05,505
And your family needs that right now,

794
00:43:05,619 --> 00:43:06,701
so are you gonna behave?

795
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:09,068
You need to be a cat.

796
00:43:10,139 --> 00:43:12,063
Okay, I'll be a cat.

797
00:43:12,139 --> 00:43:13,141
Behave.

798
00:43:15,139 --> 00:43:16,221
No clipping.

799
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:19,311
All the best.

800
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:23,021
All the best.

801
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:26,309
Who needs to be fixed?

802
00:43:26,659 --> 00:43:30,380
Yes, letting salmon breathe
all day really brings out the flavor.

803
00:43:33,619 --> 00:43:35,543
Lord, help me.

804
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:38,588
How do cats eat this stuff?

805
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:43,266
Ah... I can't.

806
00:43:46,179 --> 00:43:48,751
I'm starving.

807
00:44:01,059 --> 00:44:04,860
Come on. Come on, Fuzzypants,
you can do it. Come on.

808
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:06,791
Hold it, hold it still.

809
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:09,465
Hold it still, hold it, hold it still.

810
00:44:09,699 --> 00:44:11,224
Is this supposed to be fun?

811
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:13,460
Yeah.

812
00:44:14,219 --> 00:44:15,550
Just drown me.

813
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:22,789
Well, that's an improvement.

814
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:24,585
Look.

815
00:44:24,659 --> 00:44:25,820
Seriously?

816
00:44:46,019 --> 00:44:47,067
Good kitty.

817
00:44:48,099 --> 00:44:49,590
Public humiliation.

818
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:51,820
Hi, Josh.

819
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:52,947
Josh?

820
00:44:53,059 --> 00:44:55,108
I got something I have to show you.

821
00:44:55,179 --> 00:44:56,750
Look, I can't keep doing this.

822
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:59,027
No, I'm not taking no for an answer.
I'm already on my way.

823
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:00,943
Yeah, I'm not gonna...

824
00:45:01,579 --> 00:45:03,025
I'll text you the address, okay?

825
00:45:09,219 --> 00:45:10,744
Don't even think about it.

826
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:12,344
Come on, get out of there.
I gotta get going.

827
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:13,420
Let's go.

828
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:27,949
Missing something?

829
00:45:29,739 --> 00:45:31,867
Here, kitty. Here, kitty.
Here, kitty. Here, kitty.

830
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:32,987
Kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

831
00:45:33,099 --> 00:45:34,510
Oh!

832
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:35,860
Sorry, honey.

833
00:45:36,619 --> 00:45:38,588
Kitty, kitty. Come on, kitty, kitty.

834
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:48,626
Of all the cats in the world,

835
00:45:48,739 --> 00:45:50,902
of course Tom picked you.
You're just like him.

836
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:52,550
That's what I've been trying to tell you.

837
00:45:52,659 --> 00:45:55,266
Stubborn and selfish and shedding.

838
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:56,704
But here's the difference.

839
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:59,101
I'm legally barred
from castrating my husband.

840
00:46:00,059 --> 00:46:01,221
Drop 'em.

841
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:04,507
Good kitty.

842
00:46:41,699 --> 00:46:43,110
Nailed it!

843
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:01,264
Excuse me, who are you?

844
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:04,226
Who are you?

845
00:47:04,619 --> 00:47:05,951
None of your business.

846
00:47:09,539 --> 00:47:11,065
We've only got one day in Ohio, so...

847
00:47:11,139 --> 00:47:13,222
- You're selling the company.
- I'll call you back.

848
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:15,028
You're cutting the books,
you're lining up a roadshow,

849
00:47:15,099 --> 00:47:17,181
and you got Goldman Sachs camped out
in the conference room.

850
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:18,420
We're taking FireBrand public.

851
00:47:18,659 --> 00:47:20,742
- With the CEO in a coma?
- The odds that he recovers...

852
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:22,231
- When he wakes up...
- If.

853
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:25,628
He is gonna fire every single one of you.

854
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:26,985
Calculated risk.

855
00:47:27,059 --> 00:47:29,630
David, when this deal goes through,
your family makes billions.

856
00:47:29,699 --> 00:47:32,465
Just take the money.
You don't owe Tom Brand a thing.

857
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:49,625
Hi, Josh.

858
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:51,340
This is pretty.

859
00:47:51,619 --> 00:47:52,905
It's gorgeous, right?

860
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:54,902
He's an Abercrombie model?

861
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:56,219
Wait till you see this view.

862
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:03,465
- Hi, Josh.
- Hi.

863
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:05,501
We need to talk.

864
00:48:05,579 --> 00:48:06,626
Let's talk inside.

865
00:48:06,699 --> 00:48:08,782
No, let's just do it out here.

866
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:10,425
Where, in the grass?

867
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:12,389
I know that we've been at this for months,

868
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:14,940
and you must be anxious
for some kind of decision.

869
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:16,871
I can't keep seeing you.

870
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:18,981
Lara, just take a look at...

871
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:23,626
Mr. Fuzzypants?

872
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:24,780
Seriously?

873
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:27,302
What are you doing here?

874
00:48:27,579 --> 00:48:30,389
You know, getting out of the city
is really great for a pet.

875
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:31,905
And this place just went
on the market today.

876
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:34,027
- Market?
- I can't look at any more houses.

877
00:48:34,099 --> 00:48:35,101
What?

878
00:48:38,139 --> 00:48:39,186
When Madison introduced us,

879
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:40,590
she said you were ready to buy.

880
00:48:40,659 --> 00:48:41,661
I thought I was.

881
00:48:41,739 --> 00:48:44,983
New house, new job,
I was ready to leave Tom.

882
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:46,789
She was leaving me.

883
00:48:47,139 --> 00:48:49,141
So, what's changed?

884
00:48:49,219 --> 00:48:52,349
Well, what's changed is
I have this shaggy gremlin,

885
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:54,103
and even when he's stalking me,

886
00:48:54,179 --> 00:48:58,070
he's a constant reminder, the last thing
Tom did was for his daughter,

887
00:48:58,179 --> 00:48:59,306
and I love him.

888
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:00,380
And I love you.

889
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:02,349
- I need to go.
- I never stopped.

890
00:49:05,699 --> 00:49:06,746
Are you happy now?

891
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:08,548
Not until you are.

892
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:13,829
- Dr. Cole.
- Uh-oh.

893
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:15,626
Bad news?

894
00:49:22,059 --> 00:49:25,826
Rebecca, I was just visiting Daddy.

895
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:27,501
He is still sleeping.

896
00:49:27,579 --> 00:49:29,581
He's getting better, though, right?

897
00:49:29,659 --> 00:49:31,548
His body is getting better,

898
00:49:31,619 --> 00:49:33,702
but he's been sleeping so long,

899
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:36,306
Dr. Cole doesn't know
if he's gonna wake up.

900
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:37,869
But he could.

901
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:39,626
He could.

902
00:49:39,699 --> 00:49:41,862
Mom, then it's gonna be okay.

903
00:49:42,579 --> 00:49:46,744
Dad's been working so hard,
he just needs extra sleep.

904
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:56,108
Three cool cats

905
00:49:57,460 --> 00:49:59,746
Three cool cats

906
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:04,429
Parked on the corner in a beat-up car

907
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:08,068
Dividing up a nickel candy bar

908
00:50:09,219 --> 00:50:11,871
Talking all about how sharp they are

909
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:14,260
These three cool cats

910
00:50:17,099 --> 00:50:18,340
I'm so sorry, baby.

911
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:19,581
Not now.

912
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:22,826
Three cool chicks

913
00:50:24,099 --> 00:50:27,547
Walkin' down the street
Swingin' their hips

914
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:31,184
Splitting up a bag of potato chips

915
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:35,106
And three cool cats
did three big flips for

916
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:37,786
Three cool chicks

917
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:42,981
Up popped the first cool cat
He said, "Man, look at that!

918
00:50:43,139 --> 00:50:46,586
"Man, do you see what I see?"

919
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:50,340
- "I want that middle chick!"
- "I want that little chick!"

920
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:53,509
"Hey, man, save one chick for me!"

921
00:50:54,139 --> 00:50:56,949
Three cool chicks

922
00:50:58,099 --> 00:50:59,943
Three cool chicks

923
00:51:01,539 --> 00:51:05,226
They look like angels from up above

924
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:09,146
And three cool cats really fell in love

925
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:13,231
But three cool chicks
made three fools of these

926
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:15,461
Three cool cats

927
00:51:17,059 --> 00:51:18,902
Three cool cats

928
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:20,141
What?

929
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:22,987
Three cool cats

930
00:51:28,099 --> 00:51:29,590
What's wrong?

931
00:51:34,739 --> 00:51:35,980
Oh, boy.

932
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:38,989
I'm an idiot.

933
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:48,347
I should have been a better dad.

934
00:51:55,539 --> 00:51:56,586
Hey.

935
00:51:56,659 --> 00:51:58,469
My mom said you needed company right now,

936
00:51:58,539 --> 00:52:00,507
so I'm volunteering my time.

937
00:52:00,579 --> 00:52:02,264
I kind of wanna be alone right now.

938
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:06,030
You should go wash your face.

939
00:52:06,099 --> 00:52:08,864
Crying really doesn't work
with your complexion.

940
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:18,510
She's a wreck.

941
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:26,380
Hey!

942
00:52:34,699 --> 00:52:35,666
Your stupid cat took my...

943
00:52:35,739 --> 00:52:37,469
Why would you share this?

944
00:52:37,539 --> 00:52:39,463
I wanted to show some boys.

945
00:52:39,539 --> 00:52:41,143
If they see you when you're vulnerable,

946
00:52:41,219 --> 00:52:42,300
they'll wanna take care of you and...

947
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:44,222
You sent this one to half our class.

948
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:45,347
That was a joke.

949
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:47,184
You know what, my dad is in the hospital.

950
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:48,704
Explain the joke to me.

951
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:50,463
I was just trying to help.

952
00:52:50,579 --> 00:52:51,911
That's what friends do.

953
00:52:51,980 --> 00:52:54,221
You know what,
my mom is friends with your mom,

954
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:55,789
and I see you over here a lot,

955
00:52:55,860 --> 00:52:57,099
but stop pretending, Nicole.

956
00:52:57,179 --> 00:52:58,750
We're not friends!

957
00:53:05,539 --> 00:53:07,621
I can't believe you just did that!

958
00:53:09,619 --> 00:53:12,987
Good work, but why did you grab her phone?

959
00:53:13,099 --> 00:53:14,590
Because I'm your daddy.

960
00:53:15,579 --> 00:53:16,581
Ew!

961
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:29,028
Livanto, round and balanced.

962
00:53:29,099 --> 00:53:31,306
I can't play, Mr. Fuzzypants.

963
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:38,581
That was the right answer.

964
00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:49,067
If this is what it takes to become human,

965
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:55,230
I will be the best cat that ever lived.

966
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:28,708
Hey, I brought something
that's gonna wake you up.

967
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:31,268
An invitation to the grand opening

968
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:33,820
of the tallest lightning rod

969
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:36,141
in the Northern Hemisphere.

970
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:40,985
I miss sharing things with you, Tom.

971
00:54:42,179 --> 00:54:44,228
That's why you need to wake up.

972
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:47,509
I'm not going to this thing
without a date.

973
00:55:06,179 --> 00:55:07,943
Are you figuring this out?

974
00:55:08,019 --> 00:55:09,670
Hey. I just want
another look at Dad's files.

975
00:55:09,739 --> 00:55:10,786
Okay.

976
00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:12,588
Is everything all right?

977
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:16,907
They locked up investors this morning.

978
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:19,027
FireBrand's going to the
New York Stock Exchange.

979
00:55:19,099 --> 00:55:20,181
When?

980
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:23,945
They're announcing it
when they open the tower.

981
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:25,989
Ian totally went behind our back.

982
00:55:26,059 --> 00:55:28,061
He's lined up Benson and Stein
and the rest of the Board

983
00:55:28,139 --> 00:55:29,141
in a secret deal.

984
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:32,822
Turns out, Ian's been working
on this plan for months

985
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:34,344
and was waiting for the right time.

986
00:55:36,139 --> 00:55:37,266
Tom would kill them.

987
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:38,943
They don't care.

988
00:55:43,739 --> 00:55:46,710
Did he leave any directives or anything?

989
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:49,630
Uh, there's a will, but he's not dead.

990
00:55:49,699 --> 00:55:51,588
Yeah, I know, I know. I know.

991
00:55:51,659 --> 00:55:53,230
I just hope there's something in here

992
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:56,030
that'll help me fight this thing.

993
00:56:03,659 --> 00:56:06,139
Damn. I'm everywhere.

994
00:56:35,139 --> 00:56:36,789
David Brand.

995
00:56:37,219 --> 00:56:39,268
You're gonna need a raise.

996
00:56:44,619 --> 00:56:47,702
But first, let's give you a promotion.

997
00:57:02,139 --> 00:57:04,666
David's pulling files from legal.
He's gonna fight this.

998
00:57:04,739 --> 00:57:06,309
As long as we get to market,
he can't do anything.

999
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:17,340
Articles of incorporation. Where are they?

1000
00:57:18,179 --> 00:57:20,262
I did find this in Tom's desk.

1001
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:22,706
He left all his voting shares to David.

1002
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:24,708
Did the audit find anything like this?

1003
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:25,780
No.

1004
00:57:26,019 --> 00:57:27,704
David knows. He has to know.

1005
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:29,748
If he knew, we wouldn't be here.

1006
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:31,503
I never saw Tom hug David.

1007
00:57:31,579 --> 00:57:32,740
I'm not much of a hugger.

1008
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:35,101
He's got him working
out of that broom closet.

1009
00:57:35,179 --> 00:57:37,068
I keep wanting to call Child Services.

1010
00:57:37,139 --> 00:57:38,824
Yo!

1011
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:40,664
Well then,

1012
00:57:40,739 --> 00:57:43,311
I never saw this. Did you?

1013
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:44,380
Never.

1014
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:47,463
We all appreciate the way
you've handled this situation.

1015
00:57:47,539 --> 00:57:51,260
If Tom doesn't pull through,
we want you to take the helm.

1016
00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:52,666
- Okay, thank you.
- Hmm.

1017
00:57:56,460 --> 00:57:58,110
- Hang in there.
- Yeah.

1018
00:59:21,699 --> 00:59:22,780
Hey, Mom.

1019
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:24,827
I hand you the keys
to a multi-billion dollar company

1020
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:25,900
and you call your mother?

1021
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:27,869
Do you still have the files
from the divorce?

1022
00:59:28,059 --> 00:59:29,630
Oh, yeah.

1023
00:59:29,699 --> 00:59:32,385
Princess, Jeanette, shut it!

1024
00:59:33,099 --> 00:59:36,387
All of the company records
for the first 10 years are in here.

1025
00:59:36,460 --> 00:59:39,588
Should probably get rid of this stuff,
but it makes me nostalgic.

1026
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:40,740
- For Dad?
- His money.

1027
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:42,150
Well, at least you got half.

1028
00:59:42,699 --> 00:59:45,146
I don't know how he did it,
building this company from scratch.

1029
00:59:45,219 --> 00:59:48,030
He never came home. That's how he did it.

1030
00:59:48,099 --> 00:59:49,226
Why are you doing this?

1031
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:51,028
Are you waiting for
him to say, "Good job"?

1032
00:59:51,099 --> 00:59:52,864
'Cause your father is
never gonna give you that.

1033
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:55,221
- What's this?
- Well...

1034
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:56,380
What?

1035
00:59:56,460 --> 00:59:57,541
When your father was just starting off,

1036
00:59:57,619 --> 00:59:59,224
he couldn't think of
a name for the company,

1037
00:59:59,340 --> 01:00:01,740
and then one day,
you drew a picture of him.

1038
01:00:01,820 --> 01:00:03,822
He was never there, but he loved you.

1039
01:00:05,179 --> 01:00:06,590
It's your company, too.

1040
01:00:06,659 --> 01:00:08,661
You named the damn thing.

1041
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:11,746
It's rare for a company
to be so interested in a patient.

1042
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:13,503
Tom wasn't just a boss, he was a friend.

1043
01:00:13,579 --> 01:00:14,581
I want to know how he's doing.

1044
01:00:14,659 --> 01:00:16,503
He could wake up tomorrow,
he could stay like this forever.

1045
01:00:16,579 --> 01:00:17,706
We really don't know.

1046
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:19,384
- Well, what are the odds?
- It's hard to say.

1047
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:20,985
At this point, less than 1%?

1048
01:00:21,059 --> 01:00:23,027
If you've done your research,
I don't know what else you want.

1049
01:00:23,099 --> 01:00:24,943
I'm concerned that you're
giving his wife false hope.

1050
01:00:25,019 --> 01:00:26,306
I told her we don't know.

1051
01:00:26,380 --> 01:00:28,951
Well, you know, that makes it sound
like it could go either way.

1052
01:00:29,019 --> 01:00:29,987
I can't tell her what to do.

1053
01:00:30,059 --> 01:00:31,471
I just want you to tell her the truth.

1054
01:00:31,579 --> 01:00:34,186
Dragging this out
is so hard on this family.

1055
01:00:34,699 --> 01:00:36,110
Just think about it.

1056
01:01:10,059 --> 01:01:12,300
Lara, you're so beautiful.

1057
01:01:12,380 --> 01:01:14,268
Did I tell you often enough?

1058
01:01:21,659 --> 01:01:22,661
Oh.

1059
01:01:22,739 --> 01:01:25,505
I just wanna say that I'm...

1060
01:01:25,579 --> 01:01:26,547
I'm sorry.

1061
01:01:26,619 --> 01:01:28,588
Hello, there. Come here.

1062
01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:31,630
I'm not in the mood for crazy tonight.

1063
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:33,500
Good boy.

1064
01:01:37,219 --> 01:01:40,541
I guess this isn't easy for you,
huh, Mr. Fuzzypants?

1065
01:01:40,619 --> 01:01:43,021
Meeting a family like this?

1066
01:01:43,099 --> 01:01:44,704
Do you need a cuddle?

1067
01:01:44,820 --> 01:01:46,628
Somebody need a cuddle tonight?

1068
01:01:52,619 --> 01:01:53,701
Okay.

1069
01:01:53,780 --> 01:01:56,146
This is a special treat just for us.

1070
01:01:57,099 --> 01:01:58,101
Don't tell.

1071
01:01:58,179 --> 01:02:00,467
Sadly, I've got no one to tell.

1072
01:02:05,619 --> 01:02:07,588
How does that feel, huh?

1073
01:02:07,659 --> 01:02:09,230
Very, very sad.

1074
01:02:11,019 --> 01:02:12,465
Good night.

1075
01:02:15,219 --> 01:02:16,630
I love you.

1076
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:24,141
Lara.

1077
01:02:24,579 --> 01:02:26,105
Lara, wake up.

1078
01:02:32,820 --> 01:02:34,389
Are you trying to be my hairdresser?

1079
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:38,380
Hello?

1080
01:02:40,059 --> 01:02:41,505
Send him right up.

1081
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:47,619
Do you have a company to sell?

1082
01:02:47,699 --> 01:02:48,905
No, the tower opening's tonight

1083
01:02:48,980 --> 01:02:50,061
and I didn't see your name on the list.

1084
01:02:50,139 --> 01:02:51,266
I'm not getting out much.

1085
01:02:51,980 --> 01:02:52,981
We'd love to have you.

1086
01:02:53,059 --> 01:02:54,266
I'm sure you would.

1087
01:02:54,659 --> 01:02:56,822
Lara, we all miss Tom very much.

1088
01:02:57,420 --> 01:03:01,186
And maybe it's not my place
to say this, but you have to know.

1089
01:03:01,460 --> 01:03:03,588
- He's not coming back.
- Mom?

1090
01:03:03,820 --> 01:03:05,184
Go back to your room, Rebecca.

1091
01:03:05,260 --> 01:03:06,625
What is he talking about?

1092
01:03:06,699 --> 01:03:08,702
Just get ready for school, okay, sweetie?

1093
01:03:13,860 --> 01:03:15,146
You don't know what you're talking about.

1094
01:03:15,219 --> 01:03:16,460
The doctors say he has a chance.

1095
01:03:16,579 --> 01:03:18,070
I understand. If I were you,

1096
01:03:18,139 --> 01:03:20,347
I would do anything to keep him alive.

1097
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:22,822
- But this could go on for months.
- I can wait.

1098
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:24,947
Or years. And he never wakes up.

1099
01:03:25,179 --> 01:03:26,625
And Rebecca, she needs to mourn,

1100
01:03:26,699 --> 01:03:27,985
she can't do that if she's waiting

1101
01:03:28,059 --> 01:03:29,471
for a father who's never coming home.

1102
01:03:29,539 --> 01:03:30,541
Ian, don't...

1103
01:03:33,739 --> 01:03:34,900
- No!
- Oh!

1104
01:03:36,539 --> 01:03:38,268
Get this off of me!

1105
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:43,427
Please! Get this beast off of me.

1106
01:03:47,699 --> 01:03:48,701
All right, in the cage.

1107
01:03:48,820 --> 01:03:49,820
What did I do?

1108
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:51,186
You are going into the cage.

1109
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:54,070
That cat is feral, and you need
to take it to the pound.

1110
01:03:54,139 --> 01:03:55,300
This is a brand new suit!

1111
01:03:58,019 --> 01:03:59,987
He just clawed you before I could.

1112
01:04:00,059 --> 01:04:01,869
- Lara...
- I am not an idiot.

1113
01:04:01,940 --> 01:04:03,543
You're not here because you care about me

1114
01:04:03,619 --> 01:04:04,985
or about Rebecca or about Tom.

1115
01:04:05,059 --> 01:04:07,949
And I am not unplugging my husband
to help your bottom line.

1116
01:04:08,019 --> 01:04:09,987
- Bye, Mom.
- Wait, honey, I'll walk you to school.

1117
01:04:10,059 --> 01:04:13,143
No, it's okay, Mom. It's only
a couple of blocks and I'm 11.

1118
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:14,385
Okay.

1119
01:04:22,219 --> 01:04:25,268
I understand. You want to protect Rebecca.

1120
01:04:25,340 --> 01:04:27,501
And I want to protect the company.

1121
01:04:27,579 --> 01:04:29,105
But we both need the same thing.

1122
01:04:30,619 --> 01:04:31,621
Goodbye, Ian.

1123
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:47,911
Where's my dry cleaning?

1124
01:04:47,980 --> 01:04:49,469
Mr. Cox, you're scheduled at the tower.

1125
01:04:49,539 --> 01:04:50,780
Yeah, I know.
Tell the Board I'm running late.

1126
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:52,947
- Oh, they're in Mr. Brand's office.
- What?

1127
01:04:53,019 --> 01:04:55,101
But I moved up your meeting
with the event planner.

1128
01:04:57,820 --> 01:04:58,981
Why aren't you at the tower?

1129
01:04:59,059 --> 01:05:00,550
- You called a meeting.
- I didn't call a meeting.

1130
01:05:00,619 --> 01:05:02,190
David called the meeting.

1131
01:05:02,260 --> 01:05:03,306
Were you gonna tell me?

1132
01:05:03,380 --> 01:05:05,143
He said he just needed the Board.

1133
01:05:13,460 --> 01:05:15,382
You figured it out.

1134
01:05:24,139 --> 01:05:25,141
Where's the Board?

1135
01:05:25,219 --> 01:05:26,630
I sent them ahead to the tower.

1136
01:05:26,699 --> 01:05:27,780
Sorry they missed your meeting.

1137
01:05:27,860 --> 01:05:28,985
That's okay. We'll do it there.

1138
01:05:29,059 --> 01:05:30,141
We're gonna have a little vote.

1139
01:05:30,219 --> 01:05:31,630
Yeah, you know,
you're not going to the opening.

1140
01:05:31,699 --> 01:05:34,146
- Really?
- Yeah. Mr. Brand no longer works for us.

1141
01:05:34,219 --> 01:05:35,664
He's right. I own the company.

1142
01:05:35,739 --> 01:05:37,628
Not yet. Please escort
him off the property.

1143
01:05:37,699 --> 01:05:38,701
Don't touch me.

1144
01:05:38,780 --> 01:05:41,306
Ian, you do this, I will come
at you with an army of lawyers.

1145
01:05:41,539 --> 01:05:42,826
Go ahead. Sue me.

1146
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:44,503
Do it tomorrow when we're both rich.

1147
01:05:44,579 --> 01:05:47,059
Do you really think you can steal
FireBrand with a couple of bouncers?

1148
01:05:47,139 --> 01:05:48,949
And you think you can stop me
with a note from Daddy?

1149
01:05:49,019 --> 01:05:50,704
Your father's dying. You lost his company.

1150
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:53,021
At the end of the day,
you're not Tom Brand.

1151
01:06:16,019 --> 01:06:17,146
Look who's back.

1152
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:20,228
I knew you'd be back.

1153
01:06:21,260 --> 01:06:22,989
Look who's here.

1154
01:06:31,980 --> 01:06:33,902
What can I do for you, birthday girl?

1155
01:06:33,980 --> 01:06:35,664
I want you to take the cat back.

1156
01:06:35,739 --> 01:06:37,309
What's he done?

1157
01:06:38,860 --> 01:06:40,748
He's been great. It's just...

1158
01:06:40,820 --> 01:06:42,867
I think they might wanna take him away

1159
01:06:42,940 --> 01:06:45,146
and maybe he'd be better off back here.

1160
01:06:45,420 --> 01:06:47,740
I get returns all the time.

1161
01:06:48,019 --> 01:06:50,545
Some cats just don't take
to their new family.

1162
01:06:50,860 --> 01:06:53,750
When I met your father,
I hoped it would work out.

1163
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:56,422
I know it's stupid, but sometimes I feel

1164
01:06:56,500 --> 01:06:58,740
like my dad's looking out
for me through the cat.

1165
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:00,025
You miss him.

1166
01:07:00,340 --> 01:07:03,264
I do. I love my dad so much.

1167
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:04,501
And he loves you,

1168
01:07:04,579 --> 01:07:07,469
but it's not enough
to say you love someone.

1169
01:07:07,539 --> 01:07:09,429
You have to show it. Sometimes,

1170
01:07:10,579 --> 01:07:12,105
love means sacrifice.

1171
01:07:13,019 --> 01:07:14,306
You have to show it.

1172
01:07:16,940 --> 01:07:20,148
When you came to the house,
you were talking to him.

1173
01:07:20,579 --> 01:07:22,786
It's what I do. I'm a cat whisperer.

1174
01:07:23,579 --> 01:07:26,947
Yeah, but you were talking
to him like he was a person.

1175
01:07:29,099 --> 01:07:30,545
Is this cat my dad?

1176
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:32,902
Perkins, listen. You have to tell her.

1177
01:07:33,179 --> 01:07:34,829
- What do you think?
- Well,

1178
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:39,110
he makes me feel like my dad's still
around more than he ever was before.

1179
01:07:39,619 --> 01:07:40,621
Sometimes,

1180
01:07:41,260 --> 01:07:43,661
I almost wish my daddy
was more like the cat.

1181
01:07:44,780 --> 01:07:47,590
But I really just want my daddy back.

1182
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:50,139
Excuse me a minute.

1183
01:07:52,219 --> 01:07:54,222
I'm gonna show you something.

1184
01:08:07,300 --> 01:08:08,983
I'll be right back.

1185
01:08:10,099 --> 01:08:11,101
Wait.

1186
01:08:17,579 --> 01:08:18,627
You should stay with us.

1187
01:08:18,699 --> 01:08:20,509
A cat's life is so much better.

1188
01:08:20,579 --> 01:08:22,184
Thanks, but no thanks.

1189
01:08:22,739 --> 01:08:25,060
We're cold, selfish,
and people still love us.

1190
01:08:25,340 --> 01:08:27,229
That's not who I wanna be.

1191
01:08:27,340 --> 01:08:29,502
Three cool cats

1192
01:08:30,979 --> 01:08:33,346
Three cool cats

1193
01:08:34,579 --> 01:08:36,104
May I have this dance?

1194
01:08:36,180 --> 01:08:38,023
Parked on the corner in a beat-up car

1195
01:08:38,699 --> 01:08:41,943
Dividing up a nickel candy bar

1196
01:08:42,460 --> 01:08:45,463
Talking all about how sharp they are

1197
01:08:45,699 --> 01:08:47,862
These three cool cats

1198
01:08:50,180 --> 01:08:52,466
Three cool chicks

1199
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:02,301
Clear.

1200
01:09:07,619 --> 01:09:09,145
Rebecca's gonna kill me.

1201
01:09:16,579 --> 01:09:17,627
Hello.

1202
01:09:20,180 --> 01:09:24,025
- "I want that middle chick!"
- "I want that little chick!"

1203
01:09:24,100 --> 01:09:26,751
"Hey, man, save one chick for me!"

1204
01:09:27,779 --> 01:09:30,100
Three cool chicks

1205
01:09:31,579 --> 01:09:33,662
Three cool chicks

1206
01:09:37,579 --> 01:09:38,944
Hey, everything all right?

1207
01:09:39,140 --> 01:09:42,587
And three cool cats really fell in love

1208
01:09:42,659 --> 01:09:46,631
But three cool chicks
made three fools of these

1209
01:09:46,699 --> 01:09:49,270
Three cool cats

1210
01:09:50,579 --> 01:09:57,509
Three cool cats

1211
01:10:01,699 --> 01:10:03,747
You still wanna return the cat?

1212
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:06,069
No.

1213
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:09,230
If you want your dad back,
you should get going.

1214
01:10:15,380 --> 01:10:18,270
I think he might be running out of time.

1215
01:10:20,939 --> 01:10:23,101
Dad, when they open the tower tonight...

1216
01:10:37,220 --> 01:10:38,631
Get down.

1217
01:10:40,300 --> 01:10:42,381
We're not seeing
any cerebral activity at all.

1218
01:10:42,460 --> 01:10:44,542
I just don't want to give you false hope.

1219
01:10:44,619 --> 01:10:46,827
There's a possibility
he's not coming back.

1220
01:10:47,979 --> 01:10:49,823
Mom, Dad's still here.

1221
01:10:50,020 --> 01:10:51,145
Can you give us a minute?

1222
01:10:51,220 --> 01:10:52,744
You know how the cat's been acting funny?

1223
01:10:52,819 --> 01:10:54,230
Well, that's because it's Dad.

1224
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:56,701
- Rebecca...
- Listen, I can prove it.

1225
01:10:56,819 --> 01:10:58,230
Let's talk outside.

1226
01:10:59,220 --> 01:11:00,460
Come on.

1227
01:11:02,340 --> 01:11:04,149
Mom, I'm not making it up.

1228
01:11:04,739 --> 01:11:07,823
Oh, look, I know how you feel.
I miss him, too.

1229
01:11:07,899 --> 01:11:11,109
You'll see, Mommy.
He's really alive in the cat.

1230
01:11:13,180 --> 01:11:14,625
I screwed up, Dad.

1231
01:11:14,819 --> 01:11:15,945
What are you talking about?

1232
01:11:16,420 --> 01:11:19,742
I spent my whole life waiting for
a sign that I was making you proud.

1233
01:11:20,020 --> 01:11:21,430
When I finally got it,

1234
01:11:22,340 --> 01:11:23,671
I let you down.

1235
01:11:24,100 --> 01:11:25,670
I lost everything.

1236
01:11:26,979 --> 01:11:28,185
I can't live with that.

1237
01:11:34,380 --> 01:11:36,029
I don't know if you're still in there,

1238
01:11:37,100 --> 01:11:38,386
but you won't wanna miss this.

1239
01:11:54,739 --> 01:11:56,662
'Cause I'm gonna take my first jump.

1240
01:11:58,380 --> 01:12:01,350
And my last jump right off of that tower.

1241
01:12:01,420 --> 01:12:02,546
No, David!

1242
01:12:03,819 --> 01:12:06,345
Goodbye, Dad. I love you.

1243
01:12:15,539 --> 01:12:17,109
So how does this work?

1244
01:12:17,939 --> 01:12:19,225
You'll need to sign a DNR.

1245
01:12:19,899 --> 01:12:20,900
DNR?

1246
01:12:21,140 --> 01:12:22,789
They're pulling the plug on me?

1247
01:12:22,859 --> 01:12:24,862
And then we'll take out the respirator.

1248
01:12:25,060 --> 01:12:26,060
Daddy.

1249
01:12:26,260 --> 01:12:28,990
Mom, remember how me and Dad
used to dance together?

1250
01:12:29,060 --> 01:12:31,461
- Yeah.
- Just watch, okay? We'll show you, okay?

1251
01:12:31,539 --> 01:12:32,541
Daddy, come here.

1252
01:12:32,979 --> 01:12:34,708
Daddy. Daddy.

1253
01:12:34,899 --> 01:12:36,503
We need to show Mommy our dance.

1254
01:12:36,819 --> 01:12:37,820
Come here.

1255
01:12:39,260 --> 01:12:40,261
Daddy.

1256
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:44,149
Love means sacrifice.

1257
01:12:45,020 --> 01:12:46,350
Love means sacrifice.

1258
01:12:46,420 --> 01:12:48,149
Daddy! Daddy!

1259
01:12:48,420 --> 01:12:50,945
I'm spending the rest
of my life in a litter box.

1260
01:12:51,420 --> 01:12:52,421
Daddy.

1261
01:12:52,659 --> 01:12:53,661
Daddy!

1262
01:12:54,340 --> 01:12:57,548
Daddy! Daddy, come here!
We have to show her!

1263
01:12:58,180 --> 01:13:00,751
- Daddy! Daddy! What are you doing?
- My baby.

1264
01:13:01,779 --> 01:13:03,828
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

1265
01:13:06,899 --> 01:13:09,380
Thank you. Isn't she beautiful?

1266
01:13:09,739 --> 01:13:12,220
1,900 feet of glass and steel.

1267
01:13:12,380 --> 01:13:15,224
Now, you can tell
I'm a bit of a numbers guy,

1268
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:17,621
so, for me, this tower's
more than a legacy.

1269
01:13:17,739 --> 01:13:21,949
Its 2.8 million square feet
of pristine office space.

1270
01:13:34,020 --> 01:13:35,510
Before I even cut a ribbon,

1271
01:13:35,579 --> 01:13:39,301
we've leased 65%
of the tallest building in New York.

1272
01:13:39,380 --> 01:13:41,427
And we're already in negotiations
for the rest of it.

1273
01:13:51,899 --> 01:13:53,503
We can be so much more.

1274
01:13:53,899 --> 01:13:56,948
But this company is greater
than the sum of its parts.

1275
01:13:57,020 --> 01:13:59,546
Beyond real estate, in the last year,

1276
01:13:59,619 --> 01:14:01,462
we've enjoyed record earnings.

1277
01:14:02,539 --> 01:14:04,269
Global retail.

1278
01:14:04,340 --> 01:14:06,229
But before we move on
with our big announcement,

1279
01:14:06,300 --> 01:14:08,462
we have a special guest
who'd like to say a few words.

1280
01:14:08,539 --> 01:14:10,144
Please welcome Mayor Edwards.

1281
01:14:10,220 --> 01:14:11,426
Thank you, Ian.

1282
01:14:13,699 --> 01:14:14,860
New York...

1283
01:14:15,300 --> 01:14:17,506
We're gonna tell Daddy
how much we love him.

1284
01:14:20,819 --> 01:14:21,820
David?

1285
01:14:25,659 --> 01:14:26,820
- I like to take a moment of...
- Hey.

1286
01:14:26,899 --> 01:14:28,265
Wake up in there. Let me in.

1287
01:14:28,340 --> 01:14:30,149
For the dreamer
who made all this possible.

1288
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:32,539
Tom Brand.

1289
01:14:33,619 --> 01:14:35,384
Now I'm gonna turn this back to Mr. Cox.

1290
01:14:35,460 --> 01:14:38,304
We all wish Tom was here,
but someone's gotta cut the ribbon.

1291
01:14:40,779 --> 01:14:42,668
Oh, come on!

1292
01:14:53,180 --> 01:14:54,180
Wait!

1293
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:57,184
Thank goodness you found him.

1294
01:14:57,260 --> 01:14:58,546
That thing is yours?

1295
01:14:58,619 --> 01:15:01,748
That's Mr. Fuzzypants. He keeps escaping.

1296
01:15:02,260 --> 01:15:04,069
What kind of name is Fuzzypants?

1297
01:15:04,340 --> 01:15:05,751
Please.

1298
01:15:06,779 --> 01:15:07,780
Thank you.

1299
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:10,786
You little Houdini.

1300
01:15:10,859 --> 01:15:12,828
He won't bother you anymore. I promise.

1301
01:15:12,899 --> 01:15:14,185
He tried to scratch me.

1302
01:15:14,779 --> 01:15:16,588
That must have been so scary for you.

1303
01:15:17,220 --> 01:15:18,904
Fuzzypants.

1304
01:15:19,539 --> 01:15:20,541
Thank you.

1305
01:15:26,420 --> 01:15:29,344
That was some bold move you
made back there, Mr. Brand.

1306
01:15:29,699 --> 01:15:31,110
Thank you, Perkins.

1307
01:15:34,100 --> 01:15:35,386
If it was me,

1308
01:15:35,460 --> 01:15:37,189
I'd have stayed at the hospital.

1309
01:15:37,260 --> 01:15:38,944
Guess I'm moving into your shop.

1310
01:15:39,020 --> 01:15:40,350
No,

1311
01:15:40,420 --> 01:15:42,945
'cause you're not gonna make it.

1312
01:15:43,220 --> 01:15:44,345
What? Wait!

1313
01:15:54,100 --> 01:15:55,465
Wait, this is the best part.

1314
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:57,342
Whoa!

1315
01:16:01,619 --> 01:16:02,621
Whoa!

1316
01:16:06,260 --> 01:16:07,261
Whoa.

1317
01:16:07,779 --> 01:16:09,430
- Should we call animal control?
- No.

1318
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:10,661
We got Tasers.

1319
01:16:10,739 --> 01:16:12,868
Right. Let's do this.

1320
01:16:22,220 --> 01:16:24,791
All right, kitty, just stand still.

1321
01:16:24,859 --> 01:16:27,466
The sad thing is
I'll never get to fire you.

1322
01:16:27,699 --> 01:16:29,702
We're gonna break the Internet.

1323
01:16:34,539 --> 01:16:35,587
Sorry! Sorry!

1324
01:16:35,659 --> 01:16:37,548
Did you have to set it to boil?

1325
01:16:42,619 --> 01:16:43,746
Look, you idiot.

1326
01:16:44,739 --> 01:16:45,740
Oh, God.

1327
01:16:46,659 --> 01:16:49,470
We got a man on the roof.
We are gonna need fire, paramedics...

1328
01:16:49,539 --> 01:16:50,826
And animal control.

1329
01:16:51,340 --> 01:16:53,069
We got a man on the roof.
We got a man on the roof.

1330
01:16:53,140 --> 01:16:54,743
Who's on the roof?

1331
01:16:54,899 --> 01:16:55,947
He's going to jump!

1332
01:16:58,340 --> 01:16:59,341
David.

1333
01:17:08,020 --> 01:17:09,350
Don't even think about it.

1334
01:17:14,340 --> 01:17:15,579
Sir, get down from there.

1335
01:17:15,659 --> 01:17:17,264
Step away from the ledge.

1336
01:17:20,020 --> 01:17:21,180
David, wait!

1337
01:17:42,460 --> 01:17:43,461
Oh.

1338
01:17:59,420 --> 01:18:00,944
Mr. Fuzzypants?

1339
01:18:13,420 --> 01:18:15,104
- My son...
- Whoo.

1340
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:18,502
You were a man all along.

1341
01:18:40,140 --> 01:18:41,551
Meow, that hurt.

1342
01:18:41,619 --> 01:18:42,780
- Tom? Tom?
- Dad.

1343
01:18:43,579 --> 01:18:46,150
Oh, baby. Oh, I missed you so much.

1344
01:18:46,779 --> 01:18:48,747
Well, it's good to see
Tom's spirit alive and well.

1345
01:18:48,819 --> 01:18:50,503
As soon as security takes care of this...

1346
01:18:55,020 --> 01:18:56,067
Come on.

1347
01:18:56,460 --> 01:18:57,949
Whoo!

1348
01:19:00,819 --> 01:19:02,265
Good evening, everybody.

1349
01:19:03,220 --> 01:19:06,144
So, I hear Ian doesn't want
to talk about Chicago.

1350
01:19:06,619 --> 01:19:08,384
You know, we may not have
the tallest building,

1351
01:19:08,460 --> 01:19:09,949
but we do have the tallest building

1352
01:19:10,020 --> 01:19:11,430
anyone has ever BASE jumped off.

1353
01:19:11,979 --> 01:19:13,265
Let's hear it for David Brand.

1354
01:19:17,819 --> 01:19:20,551
And I'm proud to announce
that tomorrow, FireBrand...

1355
01:19:20,619 --> 01:19:23,065
FireBrand has always been
a family business

1356
01:19:23,140 --> 01:19:25,188
and nothing is going to change that.

1357
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:26,909
I see the Board's all here.

1358
01:19:26,979 --> 01:19:28,140
Let's take a vote.

1359
01:19:28,619 --> 01:19:30,827
Fifty-one percent against going public.

1360
01:19:31,260 --> 01:19:32,466
- And you're fired.
- Good luck.

1361
01:19:32,699 --> 01:19:34,429
Thank you very much!

1362
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:36,309
Ian Cox, ladies and gentlemen.

1363
01:19:36,380 --> 01:19:37,904
Give the little guy a hand.

1364
01:19:41,180 --> 01:19:42,180
Lara?

1365
01:19:42,659 --> 01:19:44,787
David. David, he's awake.

1366
01:19:44,899 --> 01:19:46,105
- Yep.
- Your dad's awake.

1367
01:19:46,180 --> 01:19:47,670
Okay, I'll be right there.

1368
01:19:49,579 --> 01:19:51,264
Welcome back, Dad.

1369
01:19:53,500 --> 01:19:55,740
No, I can handle the SEC.

1370
01:19:55,859 --> 01:19:57,908
- Just get me on the phone with Goldman...
- Sir...

1371
01:19:58,100 --> 01:19:59,863
- You might want to hang up.
- Excuse me?

1372
01:20:00,180 --> 01:20:01,944
You're not going to like
where this call is going.

1373
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:04,707
Thank you. Sorry, some nutcase.

1374
01:20:04,939 --> 01:20:06,668
Listen, we can still take him to court.

1375
01:20:10,100 --> 01:20:11,146
Ian...

1376
01:20:12,300 --> 01:20:13,301
Ian?

1377
01:20:13,380 --> 01:20:14,984
Gotta be honest.

1378
01:20:15,460 --> 01:20:17,224
I don't know
how you're gonna get out of this.

1379
01:20:18,140 --> 01:20:19,551
I hate cats.

1380
01:20:20,659 --> 01:20:22,980
That's what makes this so perfect.

1381
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:31,627
You probably want to hear that
I've learned something,

1382
01:20:31,699 --> 01:20:33,463
that I've changed...

1383
01:20:34,220 --> 01:20:36,587
Well, I still think
cats are horrible beasts

1384
01:20:36,699 --> 01:20:38,828
that would eat you in your sleep
if they ran out of food.

1385
01:20:38,899 --> 01:20:41,220
They're selfish animals. That's for sure.

1386
01:20:41,619 --> 01:20:43,667
But I'm not one of them.

1387
01:20:44,300 --> 01:20:45,301
Not anymore.

1388
01:20:51,060 --> 01:20:52,710
Be quiet. Shush.

1389
01:20:54,140 --> 01:20:55,345
Mr. Brand.

1390
01:20:55,739 --> 01:20:57,548
You look like a new man.

1391
01:20:58,899 --> 01:21:00,265
What can I do for you?

1392
01:21:01,579 --> 01:21:03,662
I know we can't replace Fuzzypants,

1393
01:21:03,739 --> 01:21:05,503
but we were wondering...

1394
01:21:05,579 --> 01:21:07,309
If you have any dogs.

1395
01:21:08,060 --> 01:21:09,060
No.

1396
01:21:09,859 --> 01:21:13,341
But only yesterday,
an old friend stopped by.

1397
01:21:13,899 --> 01:21:15,868
Used up eight of his lives,

1398
01:21:15,939 --> 01:21:17,590
and he tells me

1399
01:21:19,140 --> 01:21:21,666
he'd like to spend his last life

1400
01:21:22,579 --> 01:21:23,627
with you.

1401
01:21:25,060 --> 01:21:26,470
Fuzzypants.

1402
01:21:28,100 --> 01:21:30,466
So, that's a no on the dog, then.
