9
00:01:39,475 --> 00:01:40,602
<i>Just like Humpty Dumpty</i>

10
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:44,271
<i>I'm gonna fall</i>

00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:48,777

<i>I'm gettin' my share</i>

16
00:01:59,287 --> 00:02:01,121
<i>I've only got one suit, just one</i>

17
00:02:01,206 --> 00:02:02,331
Move along.

18
00:02:02,415 --> 00:02:04,417
<i>That's all I can wear</i>

19
00:02:04,501 --> 00:02:06,960
<i>A bundle of money</i>

20
00:02:07,045 --> 00:02:09,421
<i>Don't make me feel gay</i>

21
00:02:09,506 --> 00:02:11,883
<i>A sweet little honey</i>

22
00:02:11,966 --> 00:02:15,385
<i>ls making me say</i>

23
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:19,890
<i>And I'm sittin', sittin'

00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:22,519

25
00:02:22,602 --> 00:02:25,729

00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:35,448

29
00:02:35,531 --> 00:02:38,659
<i>Glory hallelujah!
I just told the parson</i>

30
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:41,496
<i>"Hey, Par, get ready to call"</i>

31
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:43,331
<i>Just like Humpty Dumpty</i>

32
00:02:45,834 --> 00:02:46,835
<i>I'm gonna fall</i>

33
00:02:46,918 --> 00:02:50,921
<i>Yeah! I'm sittin'
on top, top of the world</i>

34
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,090
Oh!

35
00:02:52,173 --> 00:02:53,758
<i>I'm rollin' along</i>

36
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:56,802
<i>Rollin' along</i>

37
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:10,066
That's a funny one.
Isn't that funnier?

38
00:03:10,149 --> 00:03:11,359
It's hysterical, Manny.

39
00:03:11,442 --> 00:03:14,361
As long as we're laughing,
we won't cry over the box office.

40
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,030
Talk about depressing.

41
00:03:16,114 --> 00:03:19,616
Twenty girls in feather boas
prancing around like circus ponies.

42
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,201
That's depressing.

43
00:03:21,286 --> 00:03:23,621
I love a good chorus line.

44
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:28,209
- What's this?
- It's a play.

45
00:03:28,293 --> 00:03:29,794
Who wrote it, Annie?

46
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:31,670
Some guy. Driscoll.

47
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:33,381
Driscoll.

48
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,300
From the Federal Theater.

49
00:03:35,383 --> 00:03:38,760
Don't knock it, honey.
At least they got an audience.

50
00:03:39,429 --> 00:03:42,348
It'll pick up.
Isn't that right, Manny?

51
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,603
It always does.

52
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:49,563
See you tomorrow.

53
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:53,776
The trick is to start to build
right from the back of your throat.

54
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:57,447
Works well
out through the nose, too.

55
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:59,198
Have you eaten today?

56
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:00,491
Oh...

57
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:02,993
I'm not hungry.
Don't worry about me.

58
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,245
Hey.

59
00:04:05,496 --> 00:04:07,289
You're all I've got.

60
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,002
Come on, take me to dinner.

61
00:04:11,836 --> 00:04:13,003
Okay.

62
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:16,173
You think the kitchen will
still be open on Third?

63
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:18,800
Ah! Soup and biscuits. Perfect.

64
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,810
Harry, what's going on?

65
00:04:29,062 --> 00:04:32,314
- Hey, open up! We work here.
- Not any more, lady.

66
00:04:32,398 --> 00:04:35,944
It's all right for you. We haven't
had a paycheck in two weeks.

67
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:37,694
How we gonna eat?

68
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:40,906
- They're not getting away with this!
- They just did.

69
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:43,408
Ann, it's no use.

70
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:46,411
The show, it's over. It's done.

71
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:48,497
I'm done.

72
00:04:50,917 --> 00:04:52,668
I'm leaving, Annie.

73
00:04:54,379 --> 00:04:56,422
I'm going back to Chicago.

74
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,882
I'm sorry.

75
00:05:00,009 --> 00:05:01,636
I'm sorry, Annie.

76
00:05:03,596 --> 00:05:07,057
Ever since you were small,
people been letting you down.

77
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:11,019
You gotta think of yourself now.

78
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:13,898
You should try out for that part.

79
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:18,944
Oh, I know what you're thinking.

80
00:05:19,612 --> 00:05:22,906
Every time you reach out
for something you care about,

81
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,742
fate comes along
and snatches it away.

82
00:05:26,411 --> 00:05:28,413
But not this time, Annie.

83
00:05:28,997 --> 00:05:30,497
Not this time.

84
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,754
- Oh, hello, Mr. Weston.
- Oh, jeez.

85
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:40,882
Look, miss, I told you already,
call my office.

86
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:42,884
Leave your résumé with my secretary.

87
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:46,014
Now, why would I Want to do that
when we can talk about it in person?

88
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:47,723
Because that's what
a smart girl would do.

89
00:05:47,807 --> 00:05:50,268
But I already sent you my resume.
You returned it unopened.

90
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,353
What can I say? Jack Driscoll's very
particular about who he works with.

91
00:05:53,437 --> 00:05:55,105
Please, just an audition.
That's all I'm asking.

92
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:56,356
Jesus, you don't give up, do you?

93
00:05:56,441 --> 00:05:58,026
Mr. Weston,
I know this role backwards.

94
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:01,028
Well, that's too bad, 'cause we just
gave the part to someone else.

95
00:06:01,112 --> 00:06:03,531
I'm sorry, kid. The play is cast.

96
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,286
I know times are tough.

97
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:11,372
You want my advice?

98
00:06:11,622 --> 00:06:14,750
Use what you got.
You're not bad-looking.

99
00:06:14,834 --> 00:06:17,461
A girl like you
doesn't have to starve.

100
00:06:19,672 --> 00:06:22,175
There's a new place. It just opened

101
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:30,391
Now listen, princess, this gig
ain't the Palace, you understand?

102
00:06:30,475 --> 00:06:33,478
Ask for Kenny K.
Tell him I sent you.

103
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:37,148
Just play the date,
take the money,

104
00:06:38,149 --> 00:06:40,151
forget you was ever there.

105
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:12,182
How much more is there?

106
00:07:12,725 --> 00:07:14,476
Another five reels.

107
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,187
Lights up

108
00:07:24,028 --> 00:07:25,403
This is it?

109
00:07:26,072 --> 00:07:28,281
This is what we get
for our $40,000, Denham?

110
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:29,992
Another one of your safari pictures?

111
00:07:30,076 --> 00:07:33,161
You promised us romantic scenes with
Bruce Baxter and Maureen McKenzie!

112
00:07:33,245 --> 00:07:34,956
Come on, fellows, you know the deal.

113
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:36,624
We agreed to push
Maureen's start date

114
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,250
so she could get her teeth fixed.

115
00:07:38,334 --> 00:07:41,129
It's not the principle of the thing,
it's the money.

116
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:44,090
Carl, you've been in production
for over two months.

117
00:07:44,173 --> 00:07:46,134
Trust me, Bruce and Maureen
are gonna steam up the screen

118
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:48,093
once we get them on the ship.

119
00:07:49,262 --> 00:07:50,596
What ship?

120
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:53,473
The one that we hired
to get to the location.

121
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:57,353
What location? Carl! You're supposed
to be shooting on the back lot.

122
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:58,980
Yes, I understand that.

123
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:01,399
But, fellows, we're not
making that film any more,

124
00:08:01,482 --> 00:08:02,733
and I'll tell you why.

125
00:08:02,817 --> 00:08:05,653
The story has changed.
The script has been rewritten.

126
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,863
Life intervened.

127
00:08:08,781 --> 00:08:11,324
I've come into possession of a map.

128
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:15,745
The sole surviving record
of an uncharted island.

129
00:08:15,913 --> 00:08:18,957
A place that was thought to exist
only in myth.

130
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,293
Until now.

131
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:22,377
Whoa, Carl, slow down.

132
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:23,795
Is he asking for more money?

133
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:26,464
He's asking us to fund
a wild goose chase.

134
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:31,012
I'm talking about a primitive world
never before seen by man.

135
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:35,182
The ruins of an entire civilization.

136
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:39,352
The most spectacular thing
you've ever seen.

137
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:42,899
That's where I'll shoot my picture.

138
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,278
Will there be boobies?

139
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:49,739
Boobies?

140
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:52,908
Jigglies. Jiblonkas. Bazooms.

141
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:55,745
In my experience,
people only go to these films

142
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:59,206
to observe the undraped form
of the native girls.

143
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:00,832
What are you, an idiot?

144
00:09:00,917 --> 00:09:04,086
You think they asked De Mille if he
would waste his time on nudie shots?

145
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:07,798
No! They respected the filmmaker.
They showed some class.

146
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:11,344
Not that you'd know what that means,
you cheap lowlife!

147
00:09:15,514 --> 00:09:18,142
Would you step out
for a moment, Carl?

148
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,364
Zelman and Associates.

149
00:09:31,822 --> 00:09:33,615
Give me that, quick.

150
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:37,286
You won't like it.
It's non-alcoholic.

151
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:41,499
Preston, you have a lot to learn
about the motion picture business.

152
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:47,046
Don't write him off, fellows.
He's hotheaded, sure,

153
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:50,048
but Carl Denham's made
some interesting pictures.

154
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:52,426
He's had a lot of near-success.

155
00:09:52,969 --> 00:09:54,928
He's a preening self-promoter.

156
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:58,265
An ambitious no-talent. The guy's
got "loser" written all over him.

157
00:09:58,349 --> 00:09:59,683
I understand
your disappointment...

158
00:09:59,767 --> 00:10:00,850
He can't direct.

159
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:03,604
- He doesn't have the smarts.
- He's washed up.

160
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:05,398
It's all over town.

161
00:10:05,773 --> 00:10:08,442
This jumped-up little turd's
gonna bankrupt us.

162
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:10,318
The animal footage has value.

163
00:10:10,403 --> 00:10:12,822
Sure. Universal are desperate
for stock footage.

164
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:15,323
Then sell it! Scrap the picture.

165
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:20,745
We got to retrieve something
from this debacle.

166
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:24,250
Get him back in.

167
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,876
Mr. Denham.

168
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,091
I want the cast and crew on the ship
within the hour.

169
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:33,301
No, Carl, you can't do this.

170
00:10:33,384 --> 00:10:35,510
Tell them the studio pressured us
into an early departure.

171
00:10:35,594 --> 00:10:37,638
- It's not ethical!
- What are they gonna do, sue me? Huh?

172
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:38,806
They can get in line.

173
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:40,307
I'm not gonna let them
kill my film.

174
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:43,811
You realize that none of
the camera equipment is on board?

175
00:10:43,894 --> 00:10:46,647
We have no permits, no visas.

176
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,356
That's why I have you, Preston.

177
00:10:48,441 --> 00:10:50,525
We have no insurance,
we have no foreign currency.

178
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:52,528
In fact, we have no currency
of any kind.

179
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:53,611
He's there.

180
00:10:53,696 --> 00:10:55,489
- Get in there.
- Who's gonna pay for the ship?

181
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:56,698
Get in.

182
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:03,163
- You get out of there! Come here!
- Step on it! Step on it!

183
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:06,292
Get out! You're finished, Denham!

184
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:12,505
Don't worry, Preston.
I've had a lot of practice at this.

185
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:16,134
I'm real good
at crapping the crappers.

186
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:21,474
Red Label, 80 % proof,
to be packed in a crate marked "lemonade."

187
00:11:21,557 --> 00:11:22,600
You got it.

188
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,019
Tell Maureen she doesn't have
six hours to put on her face.

189
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,395
If she wants to be in this picture,
she's gotta be on that boat.

190
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,106
She doesn't wanna be
in this picture.

191
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:33,860
- Maureen pulled out.
- She pulled out?

192
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:36,072
Yesterday. I told you.

193
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:38,740
You said we were shooting
in Singapore, right?

194
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,826
That's what you told her.

195
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:43,870
Yeah,
but we're not shooting in Singapore.

196
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:48,292
God damn it, Preston, all you had to
do was look her in the eye and lie.

197
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:51,044
I got to get to a phone,
talk to Harlow's people.

198
00:11:51,128 --> 00:11:52,546
She's unavailable.

199
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:55,423
Myrna Loy? Clara Bow? Mae West?

200
00:11:55,508 --> 00:11:57,842
You'll never get her into a size four.

201
00:11:57,927 --> 00:12:01,471
You gotta get a girl
that'll fit into Maureen's costumes.

202
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,058
Fay's a size four.

203
00:12:05,142 --> 00:12:08,645
Yes, she is,
but she's doing a picture with RKO.

204
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:11,690
Cooper, huh?

205
00:12:13,484 --> 00:12:15,235
I might have known.

206
00:12:16,028 --> 00:12:17,988
You're not listening.
We got to delay the shoot.

207
00:12:18,072 --> 00:12:20,533
Shut production down.
We can't sail tonight.

208
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:22,033
- Not an option.
- Carl.

209
00:12:22,118 --> 00:12:23,576
I said I'd find a girl.

210
00:12:23,661 --> 00:12:25,913
For God's sake, Preston,
think like a winner!

211
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:28,832
Call Jack.
I need that goddamn screenplay!

212
00:12:30,668 --> 00:12:32,753
Defeat is always momentary.

213
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:07,788
What?

214
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:05,386
Hey! You gonna pay for this?

215
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:07,972
Excuse me.

216
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:12,519
Ma'am, I think you dropped this.

217
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,739
Vaudeville, huh?

218
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:26,866
I worked vaudeville once.
That is a tough audience.

219
00:14:26,951 --> 00:14:28,701
If you don't kill them fast,
they kill you.

220
00:14:28,786 --> 00:14:30,287
Mr. Denham,

221
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:32,288
I want you to know

222
00:14:32,373 --> 00:14:35,167
that I'm not in the habit
of accepting charity from strangers.

223
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,126
Or, for that matter,

224
00:14:37,753 --> 00:14:39,712
taking things
that don't belong to me.

225
00:14:39,797 --> 00:14:41,715
It was obviously
a terrible misunderstanding.

226
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:43,716
It's just that
I haven't been paid in a while.

227
00:14:43,801 --> 00:14:47,221
That's awful.
Anyway, Ann... May I call you Ann?

228
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:53,686
You wouldn't happen to be
a size four, by any chance?

229
00:14:56,272 --> 00:14:58,231
No, no. Oh, God, no.

230
00:14:58,315 --> 00:15:00,859
You've got me all wrong.
Miss Darrow, please.

231
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:03,028
I'm not that type of person at all.

232
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:04,779
What type of person are you?

233
00:15:04,863 --> 00:15:07,825
I'm someone you can trust, Ann.
I'm a movie producer.

234
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:11,995
Believe me, I am on the level.
No funny business. Please sit down.

235
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:14,623
Please. Please.

236
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:19,628
Okay.

237
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:23,131
Ann, I want you to imagine

238
00:15:23,215 --> 00:15:25,884
a handsome explorer
bound for the Far East.

239
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:28,261
You're filming in the Far East?

240
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,846
Singapore.

241
00:15:31,849 --> 00:15:34,684
On board ship,
he meets a mysterious girl.

242
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:38,563
She's beautiful,
she's fragile, haunted.

243
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:42,317
And she can't escape the feeling
that forces beyond her control

244
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:46,322
are compelling her down a road
from which she cannot draw back.

245
00:15:46,614 --> 00:15:50,576
It's as if her whole life
has been a prelude to this moment,

246
00:15:52,411 --> 00:15:56,331
this fateful meeting
that changes everything.

247
00:15:57,374 --> 00:16:00,961
And sure enough,
against her better judgment...

248
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:02,712
She falls in love.

249
00:16:03,422 --> 00:16:04,505
Yes.

250
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:06,634
But she doesn't trust it.

251
00:16:06,884 --> 00:16:09,761
She's not even sure
if she believes in love.

252
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:12,221
Uh,

253
00:16:12,306 --> 00:16:13,514
really?

254
00:16:13,682 --> 00:16:16,018
If she loves someone, it's doomed.

255
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,519
Why is that?

256
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:20,522
Good things never last, Mr. Denham.

257
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:23,734
Huh.

258
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,572
So you're interested.
Good. That's settled, then.

259
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:31,158
Now, I don't wanna rush you,
but we are under some time pressure.

260
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,661
- Well, I really...
- Ann, I'm telling you,

261
00:16:33,744 --> 00:16:35,078
you're perfect. Look at you.

262
00:16:35,162 --> 00:16:37,163
You're the saddest girl
I've ever met.

263
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:41,335
You're gonna make them weep, Ann.
You're gonna break their hearts.

264
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:44,672
See, that's where you're wrong,
Mr. Denham.

265
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:47,383
I make people laugh,
that's what I do.

266
00:16:47,883 --> 00:16:50,009
Good luck with your picture.

267
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:55,390
Ann? Miss Darrow, please!

268
00:16:55,474 --> 00:16:56,850
I'm offering you money.

269
00:16:56,933 --> 00:17:00,604
Adventure, fame, the thrill of
a lifetime, and a long sea voyage.

270
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:01,772
You want to read a script?

271
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:04,942
Jack Driscoll's turning in a draft
as we speak.

272
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:08,278
Jack Driscoll?

273
00:17:08,362 --> 00:17:09,696
Sure. Why?

274
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:11,781
Wait. You know him?

275
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:16,412
No, not personally.
I've seen his plays.

276
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:18,454
What a writer, huh?
And let me tell you, Ann,

277
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:21,541
Jack Driscoll does not want just
anyone starring in this picture.

278
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,000
He said to me, "Carl,

279
00:17:23,085 --> 00:17:26,422
"somewhere out there
is a woman born to play this role."

280
00:17:26,505 --> 00:17:28,923
And as soon as I saw you, I knew.

281
00:17:31,218 --> 00:17:32,552
Knew what?

282
00:17:34,555 --> 00:17:36,807
It was always going to be you.

283
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:51,320
- How much do I owe you?
- Make it a quarter.

284
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:52,990
Keep the change.

285
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,410
Is this the moving picture ship?

286
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:57,661
Hmm?

287
00:17:57,827 --> 00:17:59,872
Uh, not exactly.

288
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:02,332
It's actually this one over here.

289
00:18:11,884 --> 00:18:16,012
Don't let appearances deceive you.
It's much more spacious on board.

290
00:18:17,306 --> 00:18:18,932
- Is this all of the equipment?
- Yeah.

291
00:18:19,016 --> 00:18:20,099
- This is all of it?
- Yeah.

292
00:18:20,183 --> 00:18:21,769
- We're taking the Bell & Howell?
- Yeah.

293
00:18:21,852 --> 00:18:24,563
- Good. You got all the lenses?
- Sure.

294
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:26,190
- Carl!
- Yes!

295
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:28,650
Get it on board, fellows, come on.

296
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:33,447
It's bad, it's bad.

297
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,406
They're on their way.
I've just had word.

298
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,617
- Who?
- Men in uniform.

299
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:39,787
The studio called the cops.

300
00:18:42,247 --> 00:18:44,290
Englehorn! Cast off!

301
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:46,250
Hoist up the mainsail,
raise the anchor,

302
00:18:46,335 --> 00:18:48,377
whatever the hell it is you do.
We gotta leave!

303
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:50,130
I cannot do that.

304
00:18:50,547 --> 00:18:52,465
We are waiting on the manifest.

305
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:55,009
What? Who? English, please.

306
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:57,136
Paperwork, Mr. Denham.

307
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:00,807
I'll give you another $1,000
to leave now.

308
00:19:00,891 --> 00:19:03,268
You haven't given me
the first $1,000 yet.

309
00:19:03,352 --> 00:19:05,311
Can we talk about this later?

310
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:08,481
Can't you see
we're in the company of a VIP guest?

311
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:15,571
Ma'am.

312
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:17,865
Ann Darrow.

313
00:19:19,034 --> 00:19:22,037
So you are ready for this voyage,
Miss Darrow?

314
00:19:22,287 --> 00:19:23,413
Sure.

315
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:26,541
Nervous?

316
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:31,087
Nervous? No.

317
00:19:31,547 --> 00:19:34,383
Why? Should <i>I</i> be?

318
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,552
It isn't every woman
who would take such a risk.

319
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:43,599
Why don't I
show Miss Darrow to her cabin?

320
00:19:44,101 --> 00:19:46,478
Wonderful idea. Thank you, Preston.

321
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:48,980
Miss Darrow, if you would just...

322
00:19:50,941 --> 00:19:54,403
Hi. My name is Preston.
Carl's assistant.

323
00:19:54,611 --> 00:19:57,489
$2,000. It's a deal.
Will you take a check?

324
00:19:58,115 --> 00:19:59,825
Do I have a choice?

325
00:20:00,992 --> 00:20:02,368
Please follow me.

326
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:04,704
If there's anything that you...
Excuse me, fellows.

327
00:20:04,788 --> 00:20:08,709
If there's anything that you need,
please don't hesitate to ask.

328
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:29,563
Oh, Jesus! Jack, you scared me.

329
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:34,026
Listen. If anyone comes to the door,
don't open it. You haven't seen me.

330
00:20:34,151 --> 00:20:36,694
Say I got depressed
and committed suicide.

331
00:20:36,778 --> 00:20:38,989
Say I stuck my head down the toilet.

332
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:41,950
- You want one?
- No. I can't stay, Carl.

333
00:20:42,034 --> 00:20:45,077
I got a rehearsal for which
I am now three hours late.

334
00:20:45,996 --> 00:20:48,332
- What's this?
- It's the script.

335
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,086
This is a script?

336
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:55,923
Jack, this is 15 pages.

337
00:20:56,006 --> 00:20:58,634
I know, but they're good. You've got
15 good pages there, Carl.

338
00:20:58,717 --> 00:21:00,719
I'm supposed to be making
a feature-length picture.

339
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:03,180
You told me I had more time.
I'm sorry. Look, I gotta go.

340
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,265
No, Jack, you can't do this to me.
I have a beginning,

341
00:21:05,348 --> 00:21:07,934
but I need a middle and an end.
I gotta have something to shoot.

342
00:21:08,018 --> 00:21:11,229
Look, you got my notes.
I got to go, pal. See you.

343
00:21:15,692 --> 00:21:18,194
All right, fine.
We might as well settle up.

344
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:21,073
You're gonna pay me?

345
00:21:21,155 --> 00:21:23,075
I'm not gonna stiff a friend.

346
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:28,079
I've never known you
to volunteer cash before.

347
00:21:28,163 --> 00:21:29,998
How's $2,000 sound?

348
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:33,085
Sounds great.

349
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:34,877
I thought it might.

350
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:37,506
- Sounds great.
- Okay.

351
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,633
Raise the spring line!

352
00:21:40,258 --> 00:21:42,176
Watch the aft!

353
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,186
And voila.

354
00:21:52,854 --> 00:21:54,064
Thanks.

355
00:21:56,817 --> 00:21:58,902
You've written "two grand."

356
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:04,740
So I did. Sorry about that.
Let's start from the beginning.

357
00:22:05,116 --> 00:22:07,536
"Two thousand dollars."

358
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:17,086
It is the 29th, isn't it?

359
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:19,964
Oh, come on, it's the 25th.
It's the 25th.

360
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,550
God, I'm sorry.
It'll just take a sec.

361
00:22:22,634 --> 00:22:24,803
Never mind, Carl.
Just pay me when you get back.

362
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:26,262
All right.

363
00:22:39,651 --> 00:22:42,695
Your cabin is the last on the left,
Mr. Baxter.

364
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:47,284
And may I just say how excited we
are to have you back with us, sir?

365
00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:49,161
Be a sport and lend a hand here,
would you?

366
00:22:49,243 --> 00:22:51,246
Excuse me.
I'm trying to... I gotta get...

367
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:55,500
Christ!

368
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:58,211
Appreciate the help, fellow.

369
00:22:58,295 --> 00:23:00,422
Let me get the door for you.

370
00:23:01,131 --> 00:23:03,674
Welcome to your stateroom, sir.

371
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:11,266
Dead slow ahead both, Mr. Hayes.

372
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:13,309
Dead slow ahead both, Captain.

373
00:23:21,151 --> 00:23:22,652
Oh, Christ!

374
00:23:32,037 --> 00:23:33,454
God damn it!

375
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:45,299
I keep telling you, Jack,
there's no money in theater.

376
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:49,846
Oh, no! No!

377
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:54,058
You're much better off
sticking with film.

378
00:23:54,308 --> 00:23:56,728
I don't do it for the money, Carl.

379
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:00,356
I happen to love the theater.

380
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:02,275
No, you don't.

381
00:24:03,527 --> 00:24:05,528
If you really loved it,

382
00:24:05,987 --> 00:24:07,571
you would have jumped.

383
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:13,244
You! This is your fault!

384
00:24:27,675 --> 00:24:30,804
This room very comfortable.
Plenty dim light, fresh straw.

385
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:32,931
Jesus. What do you keep down here?

386
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:35,349
Lion, tiger, hippo, you name it.

387
00:24:36,393 --> 00:24:38,103
You sell them to zoos?

388
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:39,770
Zoo, circus

389
00:24:40,063 --> 00:24:42,691
Skipper get big money
for rare animal.

390
00:24:42,816 --> 00:24:45,943
Careful.
Camel have bad accident on floor.

391
00:24:46,111 --> 00:24:47,778
Stain unremovable.

392
00:24:50,949 --> 00:24:53,367
Skipper catch
any wild animal you want.

393
00:24:53,451 --> 00:24:55,327
He'll do you real good price
on white rhino.

394
00:24:55,412 --> 00:24:56,538
Choy.

395
00:24:58,832 --> 00:25:02,169
My apologies for not being able
to offer you a cabin.

396
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:05,087
Have you found an enclosure
to your taste?

397
00:25:06,256 --> 00:25:07,590
Spoiled for choice.

398
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:10,426
What are you, Mr. Driscoll? A lion?

399
00:25:11,469 --> 00:25:13,221
Or a chimpanzee?

400
00:25:14,681 --> 00:25:16,307
I'll take this one.

401
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:30,905
I told you to lock it up.

402
00:25:30,989 --> 00:25:34,534
- Sorry, Skipper. Lumpy said...
- Lumpy doesn't give the orders!

403
00:25:34,617 --> 00:25:37,662
What are you trying to do?
Put the whole ship to sleep?

404
00:25:40,957 --> 00:25:42,791
Get them out of here.

405
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:20,788
- Compliments of the chef.
- Okay.

406
00:26:26,169 --> 00:26:28,171
Oh, Christ. Oh, God.

407
00:26:28,755 --> 00:26:31,090
Lamb's brains in walnut sauce.

408
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:37,931
Jimmy.

409
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:40,099
You run those ropes up on deck
like I told you?

410
00:26:40,182 --> 00:26:42,184
Doing it now, Mr. Hayes.

411
00:26:42,477 --> 00:26:46,355
How about
you return Mr. Driscoll's pen first?

412
00:26:54,197 --> 00:26:56,031
He don't mean no harm.

413
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,034
Thanks.

414
00:26:58,117 --> 00:26:59,868
- I'll keep him out of your way.
- It's okay.

415
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:02,454
It's just that
he likes it down here.

416
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:05,165
It's where I found him
four years ago.

417
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:08,086
Stowed away
in one of them back cages.

418
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:11,798
His arm was broken in two places.

419
00:27:13,008 --> 00:27:15,884
He was wilder
than half the animals in here.

420
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,388
Still won't tell me
where he came from.

421
00:27:20,557 --> 00:27:22,683
But it wasn't anyplace good.

422
00:27:25,353 --> 00:27:27,355
You got to straighten up.

423
00:27:27,605 --> 00:27:28,772
Jimmy.

424
00:27:29,566 --> 00:27:32,568
You don't want to be on this ship
the rest of your life.

425
00:27:32,652 --> 00:27:35,029
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don't, Jimmy.

426
00:27:35,238 --> 00:27:37,574
You got to be smart.
Get yourself educated.

427
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:39,576
Give yourself some options.
Take this seriously!

428
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:41,786
I do, Mr. Hayes, I do. Look

429
00:27:41,911 --> 00:27:43,413
I've been reading.

430
00:27:46,374 --> 00:27:48,084
Where'd you get this?

431
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:49,501
I borrowed it.

432
00:27:52,922 --> 00:27:54,840
On long-term loan.

433
00:27:55,342 --> 00:27:56,759
Look at this. Look, look.

434
00:27:56,843 --> 00:28:00,096
"Adventures on a tramp steamer."
See? Just like us.

435
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:09,814
It's so nice to meet you, Mr. Driscoll.

436
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:13,401
I'm actually quite familiar
with your work, yes.

437
00:28:17,364 --> 00:28:20,491
Hello, Mr. Driscoll.
It's so nice to meet you.

438
00:28:20,616 --> 00:28:23,536
Actually,
I'm quite familiar with your work.

439
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:25,829
I'm a huge fan.

440
00:28:25,913 --> 00:28:27,832
I've read everything
you've ever written.

441
00:28:27,915 --> 00:28:29,375
No, too much.

442
00:28:30,085 --> 00:28:33,337
Gonna have the ship's engines
all over the dialog.

443
00:28:34,088 --> 00:28:35,423
Seagulls.

444
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:38,550
Camera noise. Wind.
Christ knows what else.

445
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:39,802
I don't care, Mike.

446
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:42,305
You're the sound recordist.
Make it work.

447
00:28:43,765 --> 00:28:46,558
Ann! Come on in.
Let me introduce you to the crew.

448
00:28:46,643 --> 00:28:48,811
This is Herb, the cameraman.

449
00:28:49,395 --> 00:28:52,065
- Delighted to meet you, ma'am.
- Likewise.

450
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:54,317
May I say what a lovely dress?

451
00:28:54,401 --> 00:28:57,319
Oh, this old thing?
I just threw it on.

452
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:00,323
Isn't that
one of Maureen's costumes?

453
00:29:00,698 --> 00:29:04,411
Now, what does a girl have to do
around here to get some breakfast?

454
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:06,538
Lumpy, you heard the lady.

455
00:29:06,621 --> 00:29:10,083
Fancy my porridge a la walnuts?

456
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:16,839
Oh, Ann,
I don't believe you've met...

457
00:29:19,217 --> 00:29:20,300
Ann?

458
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:23,930
That's all right, Mr. Denham.
I know who this is.

459
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:32,855
Thrilled to meet you.
It's an honor to be a part of this.

460
00:29:34,065 --> 00:29:35,482
Gee, thanks.

461
00:29:36,067 --> 00:29:38,987
Actually,
I'm quite familiar with your work.

462
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:40,613
Really?

463
00:29:41,405 --> 00:29:43,450
Yes, and what I most admire

464
00:29:43,532 --> 00:29:47,119
is the way you've captured
the voice of the common people.

465
00:29:48,413 --> 00:29:50,205
Well, that's my job.

466
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:55,461
I'm sure you've heard this before,
Mr. Driscoll,

467
00:29:55,545 --> 00:29:56,962
if you don't mind me saying,

468
00:29:57,046 --> 00:30:00,133
but you don't look
at all like your photograph.

469
00:30:05,262 --> 00:30:06,972
- Excuse me.
- Wait a minute, Ann...

470
00:30:07,056 --> 00:30:09,808
He's so much younger in person.
And much better-looking.

471
00:30:09,893 --> 00:30:11,519
Ann, stop. Stop right there.

472
00:30:11,603 --> 00:30:13,770
You see, I was just afraid
that you might be

473
00:30:13,855 --> 00:30:16,648
one of those
self-obsessed literary types.

474
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:18,526
- I'm sorry, I'm not...
- You know,

475
00:30:18,609 --> 00:30:22,363
the tweedy twerp with his nose
in his book and his head up his...

476
00:30:26,576 --> 00:30:29,244
It's nice to meet you, too,
Miss Darrow.

477
00:30:43,134 --> 00:30:44,551
Good Christ!

478
00:31:11,037 --> 00:31:14,582
She's standing at the railing.
She doesn't know it yet,

479
00:31:15,833 --> 00:31:19,336
but they are sailing
towards disaster. You got that?

480
00:31:19,503 --> 00:31:21,256
Okay, so she turns,

481
00:31:22,548 --> 00:31:25,175
the first mate is staggering
towards her.

482
00:31:25,801 --> 00:31:28,387
There's a knife
sticking out of his back.

483
00:31:28,471 --> 00:31:31,391
Wait a sec.
We're killing off the first mate?

484
00:31:31,932 --> 00:31:34,102
That's assuming
she knows who the first mate is.

485
00:31:34,184 --> 00:31:37,020
Come on, Jack.
It was an honest mistake.

486
00:31:37,105 --> 00:31:39,648
Ann is nearsighted.
It could have happened to anyone.

487
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,317
I was joking, Carl.

488
00:31:41,401 --> 00:31:44,695
The point is, she's horrified.
She has to look away.

489
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:49,534
And that's when she sees it.

490
00:31:51,702 --> 00:31:53,078
Sees what?

491
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:55,455
What?

492
00:32:01,003 --> 00:32:02,337
The island.

493
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:10,471
We're filming on an island now?
When did this happen?

494
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:13,641
Jack, keep your voice down.

495
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:16,685
I don't want the crew
getting spooked.

496
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:20,272
Why would they get spooked?
What's it called?

497
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:22,400
All right. It has a local name,

498
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:24,986
but I'm warning you, Jack,
it doesn't sound good.

499
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:27,779
They call it Skull Island.

500
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,574
Did you get that?

501
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:31,701
What's wrong with this place?

502
00:32:31,784 --> 00:32:34,537
There's nothing
officially wrong with it.

503
00:32:34,703 --> 00:32:38,082
Because, technically,
it hasn't been discovered yet.

504
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,461
Okay. All right.

505
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:46,923
So we arrive at this place.

506
00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:48,718
S...

507
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:50,552
K...

508
00:32:51,596 --> 00:32:52,971
U...

509
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:55,182
L...

510
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:57,934
L-

511
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:04,776
Island.

512
00:33:09,071 --> 00:33:12,157
All right, everyone, from the top!
And action!

513
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:17,372
I think this is awfully exciting!
I've never been on a ship before.

514
00:33:17,454 --> 00:33:20,040
And I've never been on one
with a woman before.

515
00:33:20,124 --> 00:33:23,586
I guess you don't think much
of women on ships, do you?

516
00:33:23,961 --> 00:33:25,630
No, they're a nuisance.

517
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:29,384
- Well, I'll try not to be.
- Just being around is trouble.

518
00:33:37,642 --> 00:33:38,726
Cut!

519
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:41,186
It's great.

520
00:33:41,311 --> 00:33:45,525
Bruce, wonderful performance.
You can relax for 10 minutes.

521
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:48,528
That was very natural. I felt moved.

522
00:33:48,653 --> 00:33:52,155
What do you think, Driscoll?
Dialog's got some flow now, huh?

523
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,032
It was pure effluence.

524
00:33:54,116 --> 00:33:55,867
I beefed up the banter.

525
00:33:55,951 --> 00:33:58,121
Try to resist that impulse.

526
00:33:58,704 --> 00:34:00,373
It's just a little bit of humor,
bud.

527
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:02,916
What are you,
a Bolshevik or something?

528
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,210
Actors.

529
00:34:05,336 --> 00:34:08,630
Travel the world,
but all they ever see is a mirror.

530
00:34:21,143 --> 00:34:22,478
Good legs.

531
00:34:24,146 --> 00:34:26,733
Sea legs. Well, you know, sea legs.

532
00:34:29,318 --> 00:34:30,318
Yeah.

533
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:34,030
Not that you don't have good legs.
Just making conversation.

534
00:34:34,114 --> 00:34:36,409
Jesus. Miss Darrow!

535
00:34:38,369 --> 00:34:40,913
About the scene today
with you and Bruce,

536
00:34:40,996 --> 00:34:42,789
I know it wasn't what you wrote,

537
00:34:42,873 --> 00:34:46,918
but Mr. Baxter felt very strongly
that when a man likes a woman,

538
00:34:47,545 --> 00:34:49,213
he must ignore her.

539
00:34:49,297 --> 00:34:52,175
And if things turn really hostile,
then“.

540
00:34:53,009 --> 00:34:54,217
No?

541
00:34:54,302 --> 00:34:56,012
Interesting theory.

542
00:34:56,721 --> 00:34:58,764
I know. I should have...

543
00:34:58,889 --> 00:35:01,099
It wasn't what I had intended, but...

544
00:35:01,184 --> 00:35:02,726
I'm sorry. I was...

545
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:04,811
And you made it your own.

546
00:35:05,771 --> 00:35:07,273
I was nervous.

547
00:35:07,481 --> 00:35:10,108
It was funny, actually.
You were funny.

548
00:35:11,027 --> 00:35:13,320
Please don't say another word.
Good night.

549
00:35:13,403 --> 00:35:14,822
Miss Darrow.

550
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:22,663
You don't have to be nervous.

551
00:36:33,192 --> 00:36:34,527
Thank you.

552
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:37,070
Let's take it...

553
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:39,447
Would you please...
We're trying to shoot a scene.

554
00:36:39,532 --> 00:36:41,157
- Okay.
- Thank you.

555
00:36:41,576 --> 00:36:42,702
Okay, again.

556
00:36:57,257 --> 00:36:59,467
We're close. Turn southwest.

557
00:36:59,927 --> 00:37:03,097
There's no land southwest
for thousands of miles.

558
00:37:05,016 --> 00:37:07,559
It takes us way outside
the shipping lanes.

559
00:37:07,643 --> 00:37:10,146
I won't sail blind in these waters.

560
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:13,398
I'll make it worth your while.

561
00:37:14,692 --> 00:37:16,735
There's nothing out there.

562
00:37:17,445 --> 00:37:19,864
Well, then you've nothing to lose.

563
00:37:31,918 --> 00:37:35,880
If someone were to tell you this
ship was headed for Singapore,

564
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:39,090
what would you say?

565
00:37:39,175 --> 00:37:41,969
I would say they're full of it,
Mr. Hayes.

566
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:46,474
Well, we turned southwest last night.

567
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:48,351
Gentlemen, please.

568
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:52,271
- We're not looking for trouble.
- No.

569
00:37:53,606 --> 00:37:56,025
You're looking for something else.

570
00:37:59,362 --> 00:38:00,780
Yes, we are.

571
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:04,824
We're going to find Skull Island.

572
00:38:05,409 --> 00:38:08,244
Find it, film it, and show it to the world.

573
00:38:09,246 --> 00:38:13,041
For 25 cents, you get to see
the last blank space on the map.

574
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:15,628
I wouldn't be so sure of that.

575
00:38:17,922 --> 00:38:19,547
What do you mean?

576
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,885
Seven years ago, me and Mr. Hayes
were working our passage

577
00:38:22,969 --> 00:38:24,512
on a Norwegian bark.

578
00:38:24,594 --> 00:38:27,431
We picked up a castaway.
We found him in the water.

579
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:29,516
He'd been drifting for days.

580
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:32,978
His ship had run aground
on an island way west of Sumatra.

581
00:38:33,061 --> 00:38:36,565
An island hidden in fog.

582
00:38:38,317 --> 00:38:40,568
He spoke of a huge wall

583
00:38:41,862 --> 00:38:43,614
built so long ago,

584
00:38:44,114 --> 00:38:46,157
no one knew who'd made it.

585
00:38:46,409 --> 00:38:49,286
A wall 100 foot high,

586
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:52,414
as strong today as it was ages ago.

587
00:38:54,166 --> 00:38:56,168
Why'd they build the wall?

588
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:04,260
Well, the castaway,
he spoke of a creature

589
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:06,804
neither beast nor man,

590
00:39:07,304 --> 00:39:10,599
but something monstrous,
living behind that wall.

591
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:12,976
A lion or a tiger.

592
00:39:13,936 --> 00:39:16,230
A man-eater.
That's how all these stories start.

593
00:39:16,313 --> 00:39:18,106
What else did he say?

594
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,567
Nothing.

595
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:22,068
We found him the next morning.
He'd stuck a knife through his heart.

596
00:39:22,152 --> 00:39:23,820
Mmm-hmm.

597
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:26,990
Sorry, fellows.
You'll have to do better than that.

598
00:39:28,242 --> 00:39:30,494
Monsters belong in B movies.

599
00:39:30,577 --> 00:39:32,621
If you find this place,

600
00:39:33,121 --> 00:39:36,541
if you go ashore with your friends
and your cameras,

601
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:39,420
you won't come back.

602
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:42,922
Just as long as you understand that.

603
00:41:02,753 --> 00:41:05,630
How long do you expect us
to stay out here?

604
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:13,472
You're writing a stage comedy?

605
00:41:13,597 --> 00:41:15,516
I'm writing it for you.

606
00:41:17,684 --> 00:41:19,561
Why would you do that?

607
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:23,356
- Why would I write a play for you?
- Yes.

608
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:26,610
Isn't it obvious?

609
00:41:29,362 --> 00:41:30,697
Not to me.

610
00:41:34,534 --> 00:41:35,744
Well,

611
00:41:37,246 --> 00:41:39,081
it's in the subtext.

612
00:41:41,791 --> 00:41:44,043
I guess I must have missed it.

613
00:41:49,132 --> 00:41:50,925
It's not about words.

614
00:42:34,094 --> 00:42:36,096
Message for you, Captain.

615
00:42:54,489 --> 00:42:56,115
What's going on?

616
00:42:56,867 --> 00:42:59,702
Hayes, why are we changing course?

617
00:43:01,288 --> 00:43:03,539
- Englehorn, you can't just...
- Outside.

618
00:43:07,628 --> 00:43:10,213
There's a warrant out
for your arrest.

619
00:43:10,547 --> 00:43:12,173
Did you know that?

620
00:43:14,635 --> 00:43:17,262
I've been ordered
to divert to Rangoon.

621
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:24,728
Another week.
I haven't got a film yet.

622
00:43:26,021 --> 00:43:28,773
Please. I have risked
everything I have on this.

623
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:32,152
No, Denham.
You risked everything I have.

624
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:35,280
What do you want?

625
00:43:35,364 --> 00:43:37,615
Tell me what you want.
I'll give you anything.

626
00:43:37,699 --> 00:43:39,659
I want you off my ship.

627
00:43:42,204 --> 00:43:44,706
Set a course for Rangoon,
Mr. Hayes.

628
00:43:51,338 --> 00:43:52,797
I'm finished.

629
00:43:54,257 --> 00:43:56,135
It's over for me, Jack.

630
00:43:57,885 --> 00:44:00,389
How'd you think this would end,
Carl?

631
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:19,532
Check our position. Use the stars.

632
00:44:33,172 --> 00:44:35,298
There are no stars, Captain.

633
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,135
What is that?

634
00:44:41,096 --> 00:44:43,222
- What?
- That.

635
00:44:47,186 --> 00:44:48,853
That right there.

636
00:44:49,896 --> 00:44:52,648
I don't know.
What is it? A coffee stain?

637
00:46:30,998 --> 00:46:34,835
Station the forward lookout
and get me the depth by lead line.

638
00:46:35,126 --> 00:46:36,586
Aye, Captain.

639
00:46:47,889 --> 00:46:50,057
30 fathoms, no bottom!

640
00:46:51,893 --> 00:46:54,855
Reduce speed, steerage way only.

641
00:46:55,606 --> 00:46:57,483
Dead slow ahead, both.

642
00:47:00,527 --> 00:47:02,528
You should stop the ship.

643
00:47:03,905 --> 00:47:05,699
15 degrees port.

644
00:47:08,577 --> 00:47:10,286
We're getting out of here,
Mr. Hayes.

645
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:12,498
We'll find clear conditions.

646
00:47:13,164 --> 00:47:14,708
We have seabed!

647
00:47:20,422 --> 00:47:21,923
25 fathoms!

648
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:25,260
We're shallowing!

649
00:47:25,344 --> 00:47:26,677
20 degrees starboard!

650
00:47:26,762 --> 00:47:28,847
Captain, you don't know
where the hell you're going!

651
00:47:28,931 --> 00:47:30,556
Get me another reading!

652
00:47:33,768 --> 00:47:35,394
Another reading!

653
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:39,650
22 fathoms!

654
00:47:41,193 --> 00:47:43,277
- Douse the lights.
- Aye, Captain.

655
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:56,666
10 fathoms!

656
00:48:08,262 --> 00:48:11,056
Wall! There's a wall ahead!

657
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:29,824
Stop engines!

658
00:49:33,096 --> 00:49:34,889
Give me some power!
Half astern both.

659
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:37,059
Half astern both, Captain!

660
00:49:41,646 --> 00:49:42,856
Rocks!

661
00:49:45,942 --> 00:49:47,110
Rocks!

662
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:53,867
Rocks to starboard, Captain!

663
00:49:54,367 --> 00:49:56,744
To port! Rocks everywhere!

664
00:49:56,911 --> 00:49:58,496
Take the wheel, Hayes.

665
00:50:15,639 --> 00:50:16,889
Hang on!

666
00:50:40,329 --> 00:50:41,706
Full ahead!

667
00:50:47,503 --> 00:50:49,422
Rocks to port, Captain!

668
00:50:50,382 --> 00:50:53,135
- Turn, Captain!
- Starboard, starboard!

669
00:51:12,612 --> 00:51:13,822
Ah!

670
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:22,139
Shore up that breach!

671
00:52:22,224 --> 00:52:25,518
Get me more men down here now!
Come on, move, move!

672
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:29,856
- Hayes!
- She's taken a pounding!

673
00:52:32,108 --> 00:52:33,527
What about the prop?

674
00:52:33,610 --> 00:52:35,820
The shaft's not bent,
as far as we can tell.

675
00:52:35,903 --> 00:52:38,114
But she struck hard
against the rock!

676
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:40,367
Captain!

677
00:52:41,034 --> 00:52:42,786
Better come up quick!

678
00:52:44,663 --> 00:52:46,081
Right there!

679
00:53:00,887 --> 00:53:02,972
Want me to bring them back?

680
00:53:03,597 --> 00:53:05,307
I don't give a damn
about Carl Denham.

681
00:53:05,391 --> 00:53:08,853
I want this ship fixed and ready
to float on the next high tide!

682
00:53:08,936 --> 00:53:10,605
Come on, move it.

683
00:53:11,773 --> 00:53:13,775
We're leaving, Mr. Hayes.

684
00:53:21,157 --> 00:53:23,284
Can you believe this, Jack?

685
00:53:26,579 --> 00:53:28,456
We've got our picture.

686
00:54:26,056 --> 00:54:28,766
Why does Marlow
keep going up the river?

687
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:32,144
Why doesn't he turn back?

688
00:54:34,563 --> 00:54:37,400
There's a part of him
that wants to, Jimmy.

689
00:54:38,735 --> 00:54:41,905
A part deep inside himself
that sounds a warning.

690
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:45,824
But there's another part

691
00:54:46,952 --> 00:54:48,702
that needs to know.

692
00:54:51,914 --> 00:54:54,751
To defeat the thing
which makes him afraid.

693
00:54:56,628 --> 00:54:59,922
"We could not understand
because we were too far,

694
00:55:00,798 --> 00:55:01,967
<i>"and could not remember</i>

695
00:55:02,050 --> 00:55:05,594
<i>"because we were traveling
in the night of first ages,</i>

696
00:55:06,429 --> 00:55:08,722
<i>"of those ages that are gone,</i>

697
00:55:09,932 --> 00:55:12,643
<i>"leaving hardly a sign,
and no memories.</i>

698
00:55:15,521 --> 00:55:16,731
<i>"We are accustomed to look</i>

699
00:55:16,815 --> 00:55:19,985
<i>"upon the shackled form
of a conquered monster,</i>

700
00:55:22,445 --> 00:55:23,947
<i>"but there,</i>

701
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:29,077
<i>"there you could look
at a thing monstrous and free."</i>

702
00:55:39,086 --> 00:55:41,338
It's not an adventure story,

703
00:55:41,922 --> 00:55:43,550
is it, Mr. Hayes?

704
00:55:45,552 --> 00:55:46,885
No, Jimmy.

705
00:55:47,971 --> 00:55:49,389
It's not.

706
00:56:11,869 --> 00:56:14,246
- It's deserted.
- Of course it's deserted.

707
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:17,791
Use your eyes, Preston.
The place is a ruin.

708
00:56:19,210 --> 00:56:22,005
Nobody's lived here
for hundreds of years.

709
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:38,373
Mr. Denham,
I think we should go back.

710
00:57:38,456 --> 00:57:40,208
I will handle this.

711
00:57:45,630 --> 00:57:47,257
Look. Chocolate.

712
00:57:48,507 --> 00:57:50,217
You like chocolate?

713
00:57:53,054 --> 00:57:54,722
It's good to eat.

714
00:57:57,057 --> 00:57:58,309
You want?

715
00:58:04,315 --> 00:58:05,567
Take it.

716
00:58:13,282 --> 00:58:15,659
Here,
put it in your hand and take it.

717
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:24,168
For God's sakes, Denham,
leave the native alone.

718
00:58:24,251 --> 00:58:26,545
She doesn't want the chocolate.

719
00:58:28,422 --> 00:58:29,673
Ahhh!

720
00:58:51,778 --> 00:58:53,114
All right!

721
00:58:53,489 --> 00:58:55,992
Just a bunch of women and old folks!

722
00:58:57,784 --> 00:58:59,454
They're harmless!

723
01:00:21,202 --> 01:00:22,244
Ann!

724
01:01:49,748 --> 01:01:50,833
Jack.

725
01:02:05,056 --> 01:02:06,474
Seen enough?

726
01:02:14,315 --> 01:02:15,983
Lighten the ship!

727
01:02:16,483 --> 01:02:20,153
Anything that's not bolted down
goes overboard!

728
01:02:22,489 --> 01:02:23,990
Just heave it!

729
01:02:24,492 --> 01:02:25,742
We got away.

730
01:02:25,827 --> 01:02:27,536
We gotta be grateful for that,
gentlemen.

731
01:02:27,619 --> 01:02:31,373
What about Mike? He didn't get away!
He's still there!

732
01:02:32,083 --> 01:02:35,378
Mike died doing what he believed in!
He didn't die for nothing.

733
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:39,507
And I'll tell you something else.
I'm gonna finish this film for Mike!

734
01:02:45,972 --> 01:02:47,597
I'll finish it

735
01:02:49,516 --> 01:02:51,811
and I'll donate the proceeds

736
01:02:52,519 --> 01:02:54,313
to his wife and kids.

737
01:02:54,730 --> 01:02:58,317
Because that man is a hero,
and he deserves nothing less.

738
01:02:59,152 --> 01:03:00,485
Hear, hear!

739
01:03:39,025 --> 01:03:41,402
Chuck everything
except for the potatoes!

740
01:03:46,949 --> 01:03:49,784
- What's wrong now?
- Excuse me, Shakespeare.

741
01:03:50,286 --> 01:03:52,663
Come on, men! Come on, hurry!

742
01:04:03,925 --> 01:04:07,302
Drop those spare cables overboard!
Go on, just chuck it!

743
01:04:25,737 --> 01:04:26,864
- Where's Ann?
- What?

744
01:04:26,947 --> 01:04:28,114
Where's Ann?

745
01:04:33,496 --> 01:04:34,496
Ann!

746
01:04:54,307 --> 01:04:55,643
She's free!

747
01:05:01,983 --> 01:05:04,568
Full ahead, both engines!

748
01:05:11,826 --> 01:05:13,286
Ann!

749
01:05:35,349 --> 01:05:38,768
No! Stop! Turn back!

750
01:05:40,103 --> 01:05:41,355
Stop!

751
01:05:43,231 --> 01:05:45,025
We have to turn back.

752
01:05:45,233 --> 01:05:46,902
They've taken Ann.

753
01:05:59,331 --> 01:06:02,418
Kong! Kong! Kong!

754
01:06:44,585 --> 01:06:48,505
All hands going ashore!
Report to stations!

755
01:06:49,798 --> 01:06:52,259
Jump to it! Jump to it, gentlemen!

756
01:06:55,929 --> 01:06:57,639
We're doing it, Mr. Hayes!

757
01:07:04,938 --> 01:07:06,731
Come on, move it!

758
01:07:23,748 --> 01:07:25,418
Pull harder!

759
01:07:26,751 --> 01:07:28,628
ROW! ROW!

760
01:07:28,838 --> 01:07:30,047
Come on!

761
01:08:16,844 --> 01:08:18,011
Kong.

762
01:10:40,362 --> 01:10:42,155
Spread out! Find her!

763
01:10:50,997 --> 01:10:52,332
Miss Darrow!

764
01:10:52,541 --> 01:10:55,336
- Check up there, Jimmy!
- Everybody stay together!

765
01:10:58,796 --> 01:10:59,840
Ann!

766
01:11:01,966 --> 01:11:03,719
She's here somewhere!

767
01:11:08,431 --> 01:11:10,266
What in God's name was that?

768
01:11:16,649 --> 01:11:18,233
Behind the wall!

769
01:11:18,984 --> 01:11:20,569
Behind the wall!

770
01:12:12,246 --> 01:12:13,579
She's gone!

771
01:12:24,591 --> 01:12:26,342
Carl, what is it?

772
01:12:32,975 --> 01:12:34,643
You saw something.

773
01:12:41,817 --> 01:12:44,610
You can take Hayes and 15 others.

774
01:12:45,319 --> 01:12:48,073
I'll put a guard on the gate
until you return.

775
01:12:48,157 --> 01:12:50,658
The rest of you stay with the ship.

776
01:12:50,783 --> 01:12:51,868
Choy!

777
01:12:53,619 --> 01:12:55,204
Not you, Jimmy.

778
01:12:55,288 --> 01:12:57,416
Come on, Mr. Hayes. Look at them.

779
01:12:57,498 --> 01:12:59,251
None of them knows
which way to point a gun.

780
01:12:59,333 --> 01:13:00,668
Stay here.

781
01:13:01,170 --> 01:13:03,630
- Miss Darrow needs me!
- No!

782
01:13:08,510 --> 01:13:10,887
Bring the tripod
and all of the film stock.

783
01:13:10,970 --> 01:13:13,390
You wanna go with the 6-inch lens?

784
01:13:13,849 --> 01:13:16,268
The wide-angle will do just fine.

785
01:13:22,274 --> 01:13:25,194
You got guns.
You got food. You got the ammo.

786
01:13:25,652 --> 01:13:27,488
And you got 24 hours!

787
01:13:27,945 --> 01:13:29,363
24 hours?

788
01:13:29,614 --> 01:13:31,783
This time tomorrow, we haul anchor.

789
01:13:55,224 --> 01:13:56,766
Miss Darrow!

790
01:13:59,144 --> 01:14:00,270
Ann!

791
01:14:03,689 --> 01:14:05,067
Miss Darrow!

792
01:14:13,867 --> 01:14:15,284
Miss Darrow!

793
01:14:32,677 --> 01:14:34,345
What is it?

794
01:14:44,064 --> 01:14:45,356
Fire!

795
01:14:47,067 --> 01:14:48,443
Cut it out.

796
01:14:49,610 --> 01:14:51,195
Hold your fire.

797
01:14:51,404 --> 01:14:53,364
Hold your fire!

798
01:15:23,604 --> 01:15:26,523
Stay down, damn it. Stay down.

799
01:15:41,121 --> 01:15:44,791
Come on. Come on. Come on.

800
01:16:16,489 --> 01:16:18,492
Good shooting, Mr. Hayes.

801
01:16:22,621 --> 01:16:24,914
Aren't these things
supposed to be extinct?

802
01:16:25,164 --> 01:16:26,625
They are now.

803
01:16:32,338 --> 01:16:34,925
What the hell kind of a place is this?

804
01:16:50,481 --> 01:16:51,858
Miss Darrow!

805
01:16:56,570 --> 01:16:57,655
Ann!

806
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,211
- Ann!
- Miss Darrow!

807
01:18:42,802 --> 01:18:43,886
Ann!

808
01:18:53,354 --> 01:18:54,480
Ann!

809
01:19:31,350 --> 01:19:33,728
Christ, it's a bleeding boneyard!

810
01:19:35,146 --> 01:19:37,606
They've been ripped limb from limb.

811
01:19:39,442 --> 01:19:41,862
Ann! Ann!

812
01:19:55,125 --> 01:19:57,377
Just keep walking, Mr. Hayes.
Pretend you didn't see me.

813
01:19:57,460 --> 01:19:59,462
- Jesus, Jimmy.
- Hey, I need that!

814
01:19:59,546 --> 01:20:00,755
I'm not giving you a gun!

815
01:20:00,838 --> 01:20:02,841
You were younger than me
when they gave you one!

816
01:20:02,923 --> 01:20:06,511
I was in the army. I was trained.
I had a drill sergeant.

817
01:20:07,970 --> 01:20:10,097
I wanna help bring her back.

818
01:20:17,939 --> 01:20:19,899
Don't make me regret it.

819
01:20:47,260 --> 01:20:49,261
Conserve your ammunition!

820
01:20:58,604 --> 01:21:00,064
I'm knackered.

821
01:21:02,399 --> 01:21:04,444
- I can't breathe.
- I need a breather.

822
01:21:04,527 --> 01:21:05,987
Fellows,
we don't have time for this.

823
01:21:06,070 --> 01:21:08,530
We've lost too much ground already.
Come on, get up!

824
01:21:08,614 --> 01:21:12,034
They're not about to quit on you.
Cut them some slack.

825
01:21:12,159 --> 01:21:14,496
All right, you got five minutes!

826
01:21:14,746 --> 01:21:16,664
Everybody stay in sight.

827
01:21:20,668 --> 01:21:24,130
Over here. I'm gonna get
a wide shot of the valley.

828
01:21:54,327 --> 01:21:55,703
Bloody Nora!

829
01:22:02,836 --> 01:22:05,087
Is that what took Miss Darrow?

830
01:22:08,675 --> 01:22:12,804
There's only one creature capable
of leaving a footprint that size.

831
01:22:19,226 --> 01:22:21,145
The abominable snowman.

832
01:22:22,730 --> 01:22:25,442
- Yeah, a snowman.
- We dead meat.

833
01:22:26,150 --> 01:22:28,528
It's got to be what, 20, 25 feet?

834
01:22:30,654 --> 01:22:32,073
Carl saw it.

835
01:22:33,490 --> 01:22:34,993
Let's ask him.

836
01:22:37,078 --> 01:22:38,287
Denham!

837
01:22:40,873 --> 01:22:42,125
Where'd he go?

838
01:23:02,354 --> 01:23:04,104
Walk forward, Bruce.

839
01:23:04,646 --> 01:23:06,440
- What?
- You're the star of this picture.

840
01:23:06,524 --> 01:23:09,569
Get into character
and head toward the animals.

841
01:23:15,742 --> 01:23:18,328
What the hell
kind of a place is this?

842
01:23:28,546 --> 01:23:30,881
Are you sure about this, Denham?

843
01:23:31,382 --> 01:23:33,426
Don't we have a stand-in
for this type of thing?

844
01:23:33,510 --> 01:23:36,429
I need you in the shot,
or people will say they're fake.

845
01:23:36,512 --> 01:23:38,139
Nobody's gonna think these are fake.

846
01:23:47,399 --> 01:23:49,359
You're making them nervous.
No sudden movements.

847
01:23:49,442 --> 01:23:50,777
I'm not moving.

848
01:23:56,533 --> 01:23:58,868
Mother of God.

849
01:24:20,806 --> 01:24:22,182
What's this?

850
01:24:48,417 --> 01:24:49,877
What is it? What is it?
Where's Carl?

851
01:24:49,961 --> 01:24:52,755
Carl? He's up there, filming.

852
01:25:03,182 --> 01:25:04,600
Bugger this!

853
01:25:12,358 --> 01:25:13,775
Run, Jack!

854
01:25:16,613 --> 01:25:19,157
- Holy Christ.
- Go, Jimmy, run!

855
01:25:20,033 --> 01:25:21,533
Run, run, run!

856
01:25:28,416 --> 01:25:30,001
- Let go!
- I'm not leaving the camera!

857
01:25:30,083 --> 01:25:31,377
Let go, you idiot!

858
01:25:31,461 --> 01:25:33,296
Carl, run!

859
01:25:46,725 --> 01:25:48,019
Get down.

860
01:25:48,853 --> 01:25:49,895
Look out!

861
01:26:40,195 --> 01:26:41,738
Coming through!

862
01:27:46,011 --> 01:27:47,055
No!

863
01:28:30,139 --> 01:28:32,891
Carl! Carl!

864
01:28:36,061 --> 01:28:38,564
Get up! Come on. Come on.

865
01:28:53,412 --> 01:28:56,082
Mr. Denham! Mr. Denham!

866
01:28:56,791 --> 01:28:59,377
Herb! Herb, come on!

867
01:28:59,460 --> 01:29:01,212
Take the tripod!

868
01:29:01,421 --> 01:29:02,671
Come on!

869
01:29:03,881 --> 01:29:06,426
I'm pulling you up!
Hold on to your end!

870
01:29:06,509 --> 01:29:07,510
Go!

871
01:29:07,592 --> 01:29:09,302
No, I'm not going anywhere
without you!

872
01:29:09,970 --> 01:29:12,640
- You gotta leave me!
- Shut up and hold on!

873
01:30:20,373 --> 01:30:22,083
Jimmy, do a head count.

874
01:30:22,167 --> 01:30:24,712
I want to know how many are injured
and how bad.

875
01:30:24,796 --> 01:30:26,046
Injured?

876
01:30:27,465 --> 01:30:29,216
Four of us are dead!

877
01:30:35,931 --> 01:30:37,682
It's not your fault.

878
01:30:38,141 --> 01:30:40,853
What happened to Herb
is no one's fault.

879
01:30:41,311 --> 01:30:43,689
You're absolutely right, Preston.

880
01:30:44,105 --> 01:30:46,484
And I'll tell you something else.

881
01:30:46,567 --> 01:30:48,860
Herbert didn't die for nothing.

882
01:30:49,278 --> 01:30:52,073
He died for what he believed in,
and I'm gonna honor that.

883
01:30:52,155 --> 01:30:56,202
He died believing there was still
some mystery left in this world.

884
01:30:56,702 --> 01:30:59,287
And we could all
have a piece of it

885
01:30:59,497 --> 01:31:02,041
for the price
of an admission ticket.

886
01:31:02,250 --> 01:31:05,962
God damn it, Preston, we're gonna
finish this film for Herb.

887
01:31:06,378 --> 01:31:08,046
We'll finish it

888
01:31:08,130 --> 01:31:10,341
and donate the proceeds
to his wife and kids.

889
01:31:18,265 --> 01:31:19,809
Come on, guys. We need more rope.

890
01:31:22,353 --> 01:31:24,313
All right, we gotta get back to the ship.

891
01:31:24,396 --> 01:31:28,109
- Englehorn sails in nine hours.
- So? We gotta find Miss Darrow.

892
01:31:28,192 --> 01:31:30,819
Hey, do you hear me?
We're gonna be stranded here.

893
01:31:32,654 --> 01:31:36,074
Miss Darrow was a great gal, no question.

894
01:31:36,533 --> 01:31:37,909
And she was a wonderful person.

895
01:31:38,452 --> 01:31:41,706
It's a terrible loss
and we're all gonna miss her.

896
01:31:41,997 --> 01:31:45,876
I always knew you were nothing like
the tough guy you play on screen.

897
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:47,670
I just never figured you
for a coward.

898
01:31:47,752 --> 01:31:49,880
Hey, pal! Hey, wake up.

899
01:31:50,422 --> 01:31:52,882
Heroes don't look like me,
not in the real world.

900
01:31:52,966 --> 01:31:56,511
In the real world, they got bad
teeth, a bald spot, and a beer gut.

901
01:31:56,595 --> 01:32:00,140
I'm just an actor with a gun,
who's lost his motivation.

902
01:32:01,559 --> 01:32:03,060
Be seeing you.

903
01:32:04,311 --> 01:32:05,688
Anyone else?

904
01:32:07,230 --> 01:32:09,190
- Well, see you.
- Come on.

905
01:37:05,904 --> 01:37:07,113
No!

906
01:37:07,823 --> 01:37:09,240
I said no!

907
01:37:16,707 --> 01:37:20,293
That's all there is.
There isn't any more.

908
01:39:42,519 --> 01:39:45,314
Get them off the boat.
Get them off the boat.

909
01:39:47,690 --> 01:39:49,025
Keep paddling.

910
01:40:26,229 --> 01:40:28,106
What the hell was that?

911
01:41:09,148 --> 01:41:11,524
Come on. Get them out of there!

912
01:41:13,318 --> 01:41:14,653
Preston!

913
01:41:19,783 --> 01:41:21,451
Give me your hand.

914
01:41:22,034 --> 01:41:23,287
Jack!

915
01:41:28,708 --> 01:41:30,002
Jack!

916
01:41:34,797 --> 01:41:36,091
- Choy!
- Help!

917
01:41:36,175 --> 01:41:38,260
Swim, you filthy bugger.

918
01:42:47,203 --> 01:42:48,704
Choy!

919
01:42:50,623 --> 01:42:51,625
Stay with him.

920
01:42:51,707 --> 01:42:53,126
Swim to shore as fast as you can!

921
01:42:53,210 --> 01:42:54,336
Hold on. Preston!

922
01:42:55,002 --> 01:42:57,338
Whatever happens,
don't let go of the camera!

923
01:42:57,421 --> 01:42:59,048
Don't let go of the camera!

924
01:43:06,806 --> 01:43:08,600
Come on, get up out of that water.

925
01:43:10,101 --> 01:43:11,395
Get up!

926
01:43:51,225 --> 01:43:52,728
Come on, come on.

927
01:44:05,073 --> 01:44:06,992
Preston. Preston.

928
01:44:18,670 --> 01:44:19,921
It's working.

929
01:44:38,230 --> 01:44:40,233
Did you get that, did you?

930
01:45:40,585 --> 01:45:41,920
No!

931
01:45:42,753 --> 01:45:43,921
No.

932
01:45:48,217 --> 01:45:49,301
No.

933
01:46:39,935 --> 01:46:41,270
What is it?

934
01:46:45,817 --> 01:46:47,152
Mr. Hayes?

935
01:46:50,697 --> 01:46:53,283
If anything happens,
I want you to run.

936
01:46:53,783 --> 01:46:55,284
You understand?

937
01:46:55,577 --> 01:46:58,537
I'm not a coward. I ain't gonna run.

938
01:47:00,122 --> 01:47:02,583
It's not about being brave, Jimmy.

939
01:47:30,819 --> 01:47:31,988
Go back!

940
01:47:33,698 --> 01:47:35,367
Back across the log!

941
01:47:35,449 --> 01:47:38,118
- I ain't gonna run!
- Get Jimmy out of here!

942
01:47:38,203 --> 01:47:39,871
- No!
- Get back! Get back!

943
01:47:44,333 --> 01:47:45,668
Move back!

944
01:47:58,640 --> 01:48:01,016
- No! No!
- Stay back.

945
01:48:03,645 --> 01:48:04,688
No!

946
01:48:09,943 --> 01:48:11,360
Look at me.

947
01:48:13,529 --> 01:48:16,115
- Let him go!
- You got to run, Jimmy.

948
01:48:20,287 --> 01:48:21,787
Do as I say.

949
01:48:22,831 --> 01:48:24,332
Go with Jack.

950
01:48:26,835 --> 01:48:27,877
Run!

951
01:48:31,422 --> 01:48:33,882
- No!
- Shoot him!

952
01:48:35,385 --> 01:48:36,386
No!

953
01:48:51,359 --> 01:48:54,154
Here! Over here!

954
01:49:12,380 --> 01:49:14,341
Hold on! Hold on!

955
01:49:18,427 --> 01:49:20,639
Lumpy! Help me!

956
01:49:22,931 --> 01:49:24,350
Bloody hell, Choy!

957
01:54:46,296 --> 01:54:47,381
No!

958
01:54:51,594 --> 01:54:52,761
Oh, my!

959
02:01:28,239 --> 02:01:29,533
Wait!

960
02:02:19,041 --> 02:02:20,292
Carl.

961
02:02:25,256 --> 02:02:27,006
Jimmy. Jimmy.

962
02:02:27,716 --> 02:02:28,884
Jimmy.

963
02:02:29,717 --> 02:02:31,177
You all right?

964
02:03:20,935 --> 02:03:22,354
No.

965
02:04:14,489 --> 02:04:16,492
Get off! Get it off!

966
02:04:24,041 --> 02:04:25,083
Get off!

967
02:04:39,014 --> 02:04:40,390
Get it off!

968
02:05:45,997 --> 02:05:47,248
Kill it!

969
02:05:59,219 --> 02:06:00,595
Stop moving!

970
02:06:20,658 --> 02:06:22,408
Get it off my face!

971
02:06:23,368 --> 02:06:25,787
- Stay still.
- I am standing still.

972
02:06:28,289 --> 02:06:30,083
- Hold on.
- Be careful!

973
02:07:04,909 --> 02:07:07,537
Don't move!
Stay away from the walls!

974
02:07:08,204 --> 02:07:09,747
Coming through!

975
02:07:18,172 --> 02:07:20,551
Get out of there now! Climb!

976
02:07:27,850 --> 02:07:29,643
Nobody get in my way.

977
02:07:33,188 --> 02:07:34,773
Come on, Jimmy. Let's go.

978
02:07:34,856 --> 02:07:37,734
Get up the rope. Let's go. Hurry up.

979
02:08:03,635 --> 02:08:05,761
Jimmy, let's go.

980
02:08:10,391 --> 02:08:11,935
- Come on.
- Okay.

981
02:08:15,605 --> 02:08:16,773
Go.

982
02:08:21,110 --> 02:08:22,988
Just as you go down

983
02:08:24,030 --> 02:08:26,324
for the third and final time

984
02:08:27,367 --> 02:08:30,287
as your head disappears
beneath the waves

985
02:08:30,912 --> 02:08:33,289
and your lungs fill with water

986
02:08:33,582 --> 02:08:37,836
do you know what happens in those
last precious seconds before you drown?

987
02:08:38,127 --> 02:08:40,963
Come on, buddy. Get up the rope.
Come on. Get out of here. Come on.

988
02:08:41,047 --> 02:08:43,716
Your whole life passes before your eyes.

989
02:08:43,800 --> 02:08:46,261
And if you've lived as a true American

990
02:08:46,345 --> 02:08:48,430
you get to watch it all in color.

991
02:08:49,640 --> 02:08:51,225
Oh, and you will.

992
02:08:51,307 --> 02:08:53,976
Now, why don't you climb up the rope, huh?
Come on.

993
02:08:59,608 --> 02:09:01,693
Come on, Driscoll. Let's go.

994
02:11:56,451 --> 02:11:57,993
It's beautiful.

995
02:12:19,432 --> 02:12:20,766
Beautiful.

996
02:12:32,237 --> 02:12:33,572
Beautiful.

997
02:13:20,993 --> 02:13:22,203
There.

998
02:13:25,247 --> 02:13:28,376
- Thank God.
- Don't thank God. Thank Mr. Baxter.

999
02:13:28,502 --> 02:13:30,837
He insisted on a rescue mission.

1000
02:13:31,796 --> 02:13:35,257
Me? I knew you'd be okay.

1001
02:13:36,592 --> 02:13:38,845
That's the thing about cockroaches.

1002
02:13:38,929 --> 02:13:42,349
No matter how many times
you flush them down the toilet,

1003
02:13:42,431 --> 02:13:44,935
they always crawl back up the bowl.

1004
02:13:45,851 --> 02:13:48,688
Hey, buddy? I'm out of the bowl.

1005
02:13:49,439 --> 02:13:52,734
I'm drying off my wings
and trekking across the lid.

1006
02:14:00,074 --> 02:14:01,283
Driscoll!

1007
02:14:02,786 --> 02:14:06,456
Don't be a fool!
Give it up. It's useless!

1008
02:14:07,707 --> 02:14:09,083
She's dead.

1009
02:14:11,877 --> 02:14:13,462
She's not dead.

1010
02:14:17,341 --> 02:14:19,594
Jack's gonna bring her back

1011
02:14:20,554 --> 02:14:23,139
and the ape will be
hard on his heels.

1012
02:14:23,849 --> 02:14:26,600
We can still
come out of this thing okay.

1013
02:14:28,979 --> 02:14:30,564
More than okay.

1014
02:14:31,814 --> 02:14:33,358
Think about it.

1015
02:14:33,440 --> 02:14:37,112
You got a boat full of chloroform
we could put to good use.

1016
02:14:37,194 --> 02:14:39,113
You wanna trap the ape?

1017
02:14:45,953 --> 02:14:47,581
I don't think so.

1018
02:14:48,163 --> 02:14:51,585
Isn't that what you do?
Live animal capture?

1019
02:14:53,086 --> 02:14:55,130
I heard you were the best.

1020
02:15:02,970 --> 02:15:04,096
Jack!

1021
02:15:07,182 --> 02:15:08,935
Look after yourself!

1022
02:15:09,560 --> 02:15:11,479
Keep the gate open, will you?

1023
02:15:11,563 --> 02:15:13,230
Sure thing, buddy.

1024
02:15:14,024 --> 02:15:15,358
Good luck!

1025
02:15:28,622 --> 02:15:29,997
I'm sorry.

1026
02:18:08,864 --> 02:18:09,907
Ann.

1027
02:19:18,433 --> 02:19:19,560
Jack!

1028
02:19:20,435 --> 02:19:21,521
Run!

1029
02:19:51,800 --> 02:19:53,468
Jack, Jack!

1030
02:20:01,144 --> 02:20:02,311
Jack.

1031
02:20:11,361 --> 02:20:13,323
Ann, it's okay.

1032
02:20:14,156 --> 02:20:16,575
Ann, let's go. Let's go. Come on!

1033
02:20:29,838 --> 02:20:31,506
Let's go. Come on.

1034
02:20:31,966 --> 02:20:33,175
Come on!

1035
02:22:05,434 --> 02:22:06,560
Carl!

1036
02:22:06,727 --> 02:22:09,439
Please! Somebody help us!

1037
02:22:11,566 --> 02:22:13,025
They've gone.

1038
02:22:14,610 --> 02:22:16,654
Carl. Christ.

1039
02:22:17,237 --> 02:22:18,323
Carl!

1040
02:22:19,156 --> 02:22:21,325
Drop the bridge.
Do it now, for Christ's sake!

1041
02:22:21,408 --> 02:22:22,618
Not yet.

1042
02:22:24,077 --> 02:22:25,163
Wait.

1043
02:22:25,829 --> 02:22:26,956
Wait.

1044
02:22:31,084 --> 02:22:32,170
Wait!

1045
02:22:42,888 --> 02:22:44,139
Come on!

1046
02:23:56,586 --> 02:23:58,088
- Now!
- Throw them!

1047
02:23:58,172 --> 02:23:59,549
Throw!

1048
02:24:00,424 --> 02:24:01,467
No!

1049
02:24:03,844 --> 02:24:05,054
Hold him!

1050
02:24:05,138 --> 02:24:06,638
Are you out of your mind?

1051
02:24:15,355 --> 02:24:17,483
- Stop!
- Hold the line!

1052
02:24:18,234 --> 02:24:19,610
Keep him down!

1053
02:24:25,199 --> 02:24:26,200
Heave!

1054
02:24:27,243 --> 02:24:28,577
Please!

1055
02:24:29,036 --> 02:24:30,745
No! Stop!

1056
02:24:31,079 --> 02:24:32,081
Jack.

1057
02:24:33,123 --> 02:24:34,375
- No.
- Get her out of...

1058
02:24:34,459 --> 02:24:36,334
- They'll kill him!
- There's nothing we can do.

1059
02:24:36,418 --> 02:24:38,379
- No!
- Get her out of his sight!

1060
02:24:38,462 --> 02:24:40,423
- It's too late.
- Throw it!

1061
02:24:42,674 --> 02:24:43,759
Look out!

1062
02:24:46,094 --> 02:24:47,555
Let go of me.

1063
02:24:51,683 --> 02:24:53,310
We gotta go. Come on.

1064
02:24:53,895 --> 02:24:55,061
- Come on.
- Stop it.

1065
02:24:55,146 --> 02:24:56,689
Leave me alone!

1066
02:24:57,856 --> 02:24:59,399
Ann, please come on.

1067
02:25:06,699 --> 02:25:08,533
- Kill it!
- No. No!

1068
02:25:08,743 --> 02:25:10,995
It's over, you goddamn lunatic!

1069
02:25:13,039 --> 02:25:14,540
All of you, run!

1070
02:25:14,623 --> 02:25:16,291
Come on. Come on!

1071
02:25:33,391 --> 02:25:34,977
Look out!

1072
02:25:45,862 --> 02:25:47,364
Move it! Move it!

1073
02:25:49,742 --> 02:25:51,118
Come on, come on!

1074
02:26:00,043 --> 02:26:01,629
- Stay there!
- It's me he wants!

1075
02:26:01,711 --> 02:26:03,923
- Please stop this!
- Move! Hold onto her!

1076
02:26:04,005 --> 02:26:06,634
- Ann, go.
- Please, I can stop this!

1077
02:26:06,717 --> 02:26:08,261
- No!
- Ann, stay there!

1078
02:26:10,720 --> 02:26:12,138
Get it out!

1079
02:26:14,891 --> 02:26:16,727
Get the hell out of here!

1080
02:26:16,810 --> 02:26:18,813
- Come on!
- Jimmy, don't be crazy! Come on.

1081
02:26:18,896 --> 02:26:20,189
Don't be crazy.

1082
02:26:21,398 --> 02:26:22,483
Let me go!

1083
02:26:23,817 --> 02:26:25,278
Cast off!

1084
02:26:27,570 --> 02:26:28,656
Come on, Carl!

1085
02:26:30,324 --> 02:26:32,158
- Row!
- Wait.

1086
02:26:32,409 --> 02:26:34,577
Row, God damn it!

1087
02:26:44,797 --> 02:26:45,923
Go back.

1088
02:26:52,846 --> 02:26:53,972
Jimmy, no!

1089
02:27:00,938 --> 02:27:01,939
No!

1090
02:27:19,040 --> 02:27:20,875
No! Don't! Leave him alone!

1091
02:27:20,958 --> 02:27:22,459
Hide out in back!

1092
02:27:45,023 --> 02:27:46,649
- Wait!
- No!

1093
02:27:47,360 --> 02:27:49,986
No! No! Please don't!

1094
02:29:48,189 --> 02:29:50,733
The whole world will pay
to see this.

1095
02:29:53,443 --> 02:29:55,445
We're millionaires, boys!

1096
02:29:55,779 --> 02:29:57,989
I'll share it with all of you!

1097
02:29:58,490 --> 02:30:02,995
In a few months his name
will be up in lights on Broadway!

1098
02:30:05,164 --> 02:30:09,292
Kong!
The Eighth Wonder of the World!

1099
02:31:12,565 --> 02:31:14,608
What can I say? What can I say?

1100
02:31:14,691 --> 02:31:16,067
Any comments, sir?

1101
02:31:17,403 --> 02:31:19,029
The Mayor, thank you.

1102
02:31:20,238 --> 02:31:21,239
Ready.

1103
02:31:21,406 --> 02:31:22,740
What am I?

1104
02:31:23,157 --> 02:31:24,868
Thank you very much.

1105
02:31:28,706 --> 02:31:30,207
Get used to it.

1106
02:31:30,415 --> 02:31:33,627
- Listen, great to see you. Ready?
- I'm really appreciating that...

1107
02:31:33,710 --> 02:31:35,129
- Look at you!
- I remember you.

1108
02:31:35,211 --> 02:31:38,215
- You're a lucky guy, Denham.
- Am I a lucky guy?

1109
02:31:38,299 --> 02:31:40,092
Maybe you're the lucky guy.

1110
02:31:53,897 --> 02:31:55,065
Carl!

1111
02:31:56,941 --> 02:31:58,152
- Zelman!
- I told you.

1112
02:31:58,235 --> 02:31:59,611
I know you did and I appreciate it.

1113
02:31:59,694 --> 02:32:01,697
Let's get a shot of this.

1114
02:32:02,238 --> 02:32:03,364
Come on.

1115
02:32:04,074 --> 02:32:06,744
- Big smile.
- Yeah! That's great!

1116
02:32:08,787 --> 02:32:11,748
<i>Look at yourself.
Look at what you've become.</i>

1117
02:32:12,458 --> 02:32:15,002
- No woman is worth this.
- This woman is worth it.

1118
02:32:15,084 --> 02:32:17,046
I don't care what it takes,
I gotta win her back.

1119
02:32:17,129 --> 02:32:18,338
Oh, really?

1120
02:32:18,422 --> 02:32:20,090
She's not gonna buy this
for a second.

1121
02:32:20,174 --> 02:32:22,343
Shut up and hand me the grapefruit!

1122
02:32:24,511 --> 02:32:27,181
<i>- You're writing a comedy?
- Yes, I am.</i>

1123
02:32:27,931 --> 02:32:29,850
<i>I'm writing it for you.</i>

1124
02:32:31,769 --> 02:32:33,646
<i>Why would you do that?</i>

1125
02:32:34,647 --> 02:32:37,066
<i>Why would I write a play for you?</i>

1126
02:32:40,443 --> 02:32:42,111
<i>Isn't it obvious?</i>

1127
02:32:42,362 --> 02:32:43,863
Oh, I'm sorry.

1128
02:32:45,114 --> 02:32:47,283
I couldn't help but overhear.

1129
02:32:50,453 --> 02:32:53,207
So, he took me to
this fancy French restaurant,

1130
02:32:53,290 --> 02:32:56,042
and halfway through the
hors d'oeuvres, he clutches my hand.

1131
02:32:56,126 --> 02:32:58,336
And that's when he told you
how he felt?

1132
02:32:58,420 --> 02:33:01,130
- No. He never said it.
- He never said it?

1133
02:33:01,215 --> 02:33:03,174
He probably thought
he didn't need to say it.

1134
02:33:03,257 --> 02:33:05,260
Well, then how does she know
that it's real?

1135
02:33:05,343 --> 02:33:08,806
- He said it was not about the words.
- Oh, please!

1136
02:33:09,013 --> 02:33:13,143
If you feel it, you say it.
It's really very simple.

1137
02:33:13,519 --> 02:33:17,815
He said we'd talk about it later.
Only there was no later.

1138
02:33:19,566 --> 02:33:21,235
It never happened.

1139
02:33:22,152 --> 02:33:23,904
That's how it ended.

1140
02:33:24,029 --> 02:33:27,782
He just let you walk away?
He didn't try to save it?

1141
02:33:29,659 --> 02:33:32,995
I honestly believed
things might actually work out,

1142
02:33:34,122 --> 02:33:36,125
which was really very

1143
02:33:39,378 --> 02:33:40,629
foolish.

1144
02:33:40,837 --> 02:33:43,465
Men.
Oh, they'll give you the world,

1145
02:33:43,549 --> 02:33:45,925
but they let the one thing
that truly matters

1146
02:33:46,009 --> 02:33:47,927
slip through their fingers.

1147
02:33:48,011 --> 02:33:49,220
Typical.

1148
02:33:49,846 --> 02:33:53,516
They're so busy being brave,
they forget to use their brains.

1149
02:33:54,476 --> 02:33:56,352
Romance. Who needs it?

1150
02:34:21,128 --> 02:34:22,462
Thank you.

1151
02:34:23,297 --> 02:34:24,673
Thank you.

1152
02:34:27,593 --> 02:34:28,926
Thank you.

1153
02:34:30,720 --> 02:34:32,096
Thank you.

1154
02:34:33,890 --> 02:34:35,808
Ladies and gentlemen,

1155
02:34:36,977 --> 02:34:39,813
I'm here to tell you
a very strange story.

1156
02:34:40,229 --> 02:34:42,483
The story of our adventure

1157
02:34:42,816 --> 02:34:46,028
in which 17 of our party
suffered horrible deaths,

1158
02:34:46,736 --> 02:34:48,488
their lives lost

1159
02:34:49,031 --> 02:34:51,325
in pursuit of a savage beast,

1160
02:34:52,283 --> 02:34:54,912
a monstrous aberration of nature.

1161
02:34:56,120 --> 02:34:58,832
But even the meanest brute
can be tamed.

1162
02:34:58,998 --> 02:35:01,667
Yes, ladies and gentlemen,
as you will see,

1163
02:35:01,752 --> 02:35:03,754
the beast was no match

1164
02:35:04,046 --> 02:35:05,588
for the charms of a girl.

1165
02:35:09,092 --> 02:35:10,676
A girl from New York

1166
02:35:13,888 --> 02:35:15,682
who melted his heart,

1167
02:35:16,390 --> 02:35:19,269
bringing to mind
that old Arabian proverb,

1168
02:35:20,938 --> 02:35:24,273
"And lo, the beast looked
upon the face of beauty,

1169
02:35:25,108 --> 02:35:27,277
"and beauty stayed his hand.

1170
02:35:28,319 --> 02:35:32,199
"And from that day forward,
he was as one dead."

1171
02:35:39,957 --> 02:35:43,459
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
I'm going to show you

1172
02:35:43,584 --> 02:35:46,587
the greatest thing
your eyes have ever beheld.

1173
02:35:47,713 --> 02:35:52,386
He was a king in the world he knew,
but he comes to you now a captive.

1174
02:35:53,594 --> 02:35:55,221
Ladies and gentlemen,

1175
02:35:55,305 --> 02:35:59,852
I give you Kong,
The Eighth Wonder of the World!

1176
02:36:09,236 --> 02:36:12,363
Don't be alarmed.
It's perfectly safe.

1177
02:36:12,656 --> 02:36:16,118
These chains are made
of chrome steel!

1178
02:36:36,846 --> 02:36:38,682
Observe, if you will...

1179
02:36:41,934 --> 02:36:43,896
I am touching the beast.

1180
02:36:44,186 --> 02:36:48,441
I am actually laying my hand
on the 25-foot gorilla.

1181
02:36:55,574 --> 02:36:57,200
Crank them up, fellas.

1182
02:37:16,552 --> 02:37:18,721
And now, we have
in the auditorium tonight,

1183
02:37:18,805 --> 02:37:20,432
a surprise guest.

1184
02:37:21,224 --> 02:37:23,644
The real-life hero of this story.

1185
02:37:23,852 --> 02:37:26,563
The man who hunted down
the mighty Kong!

1186
02:37:27,940 --> 02:37:32,736
The man who risked all to win
the freedom of a helpless female.

1187
02:37:33,904 --> 02:37:36,238
A big hand for Mr. Bruce Baxter!

1188
02:37:41,870 --> 02:37:43,956
Thank you. Thank you.

1189
02:37:44,790 --> 02:37:45,998
Thank you.

1190
02:38:13,693 --> 02:38:15,111
He was right.

1191
02:38:16,697 --> 02:38:20,242
About there still being some mystery
left in this world,

1192
02:38:20,658 --> 02:38:22,952
and we can all have a piece of it

1193
02:38:23,327 --> 02:38:25,914
for the price
of an admission ticket.

1194
02:38:27,165 --> 02:38:30,209
That's the thing you come
to learn about Carl.

1195
02:38:31,585 --> 02:38:34,965
His unfailing ability
to destroy the things he loves.

1196
02:38:49,438 --> 02:38:52,023
Please remain calm,
ladies and gentlemen,

1197
02:38:52,106 --> 02:38:55,402
for we now come
to the climax of this savage ritual.

1198
02:38:55,610 --> 02:38:58,320
The sacrifice
of a beautiful young girl.

1199
02:38:58,863 --> 02:39:02,492
Behold her terror as she is
offered up to the mighty Kong!

1200
02:39:03,744 --> 02:39:07,831
A big hand, folks,
for the bravest girl I've ever met!

1201
02:39:08,540 --> 02:39:09,790
Miss Ann Darrow.

1202
02:39:57,798 --> 02:39:59,549
Save me from the beast!

1203
02:40:08,390 --> 02:40:09,643
Help me!

1204
02:40:13,772 --> 02:40:15,272
Where is she?

1205
02:40:16,233 --> 02:40:17,817
- Where's Ann?
- I have no idea.

1206
02:40:17,900 --> 02:40:21,279
I heard he offered her all kinds of
money and she turned him down flat.

1207
02:40:21,362 --> 02:40:26,075
<i>Pack up all my cares and woe</i>

1208
02:40:27,827 --> 02:40:29,870
<i>Here I go</i>

1209
02:40:30,579 --> 02:40:32,873
<i>Singing low</i>

1210
02:40:34,542 --> 02:40:37,754
<i>Bye bye</i>

1211
02:40:38,963 --> 02:40:42,424
<i>Blackbird</i>

1212
02:40:45,637 --> 02:40:50,183
<i>Where somebody waits for me</i>

1213
02:40:51,433 --> 02:40:53,019
<i>Sugar's sweet</i>

1214
02:40:54,436 --> 02:40:56,730
<i>So is he</i>

1215
02:40:58,566 --> 02:41:01,861
<i>Bye bye</i>

1216
02:41:02,404 --> 02:41:04,948
<i>Blackbird</i>

1217
02:41:07,117 --> 02:41:08,409
Here's your story, boys.

1218
02:41:08,493 --> 02:41:11,620
"Beauty and the man
who saved her from the beast."

1219
02:41:17,334 --> 02:41:18,335
No.

1220
02:41:26,677 --> 02:41:28,555
We have to get these people
out of here.

1221
02:41:28,638 --> 02:41:31,140
Everyone needs to leave, okay?
Come on.

1222
02:41:32,350 --> 02:41:34,935
Let him roar.
It makes a swell picture.

1223
02:41:36,396 --> 02:41:37,397
Head for the exits.

1224
02:41:37,479 --> 02:41:40,316
Get your own seat, buddy.
You're not having mine.

1225
02:41:48,115 --> 02:41:49,575
Excuse me, fellows.

1226
02:41:50,284 --> 02:41:52,995
Coming through.
Coming through, fellows.

1227
02:41:56,540 --> 02:41:59,543
Get me down! Help me, please!

1228
02:42:01,962 --> 02:42:04,799
Somebody! Somebody help me!

1229
02:42:08,261 --> 02:42:10,931
Go! Go! Get out!

1230
02:42:14,893 --> 02:42:16,394
GO! Go!

1231
02:43:51,406 --> 02:43:53,407
There they are.

1232
02:44:06,629 --> 02:44:08,298
- Go!
- Wait for me!

1233
02:44:09,215 --> 02:44:10,592
Go back!

1234
02:44:17,599 --> 02:44:18,850
This way!

1235
02:44:26,648 --> 02:44:27,816
MAN 3; Help!

1236
02:44:36,200 --> 02:44:37,201
MAN 41 No!

1237
02:45:17,117 --> 02:45:19,786
Taxi! Follow that ape.

1238
02:45:19,869 --> 02:45:21,328
Come on, pal, we gotta draw him off.

1239
02:45:21,413 --> 02:45:23,247
It's all yours, buddy.

1240
02:45:39,681 --> 02:45:41,390
Hey, get out of here, lady!

1241
02:46:02,120 --> 02:46:03,370
Come on.

1242
02:46:12,547 --> 02:46:13,548
Buddy!

1243
02:46:15,717 --> 02:46:17,135
Come on. Come on.

1244
02:46:35,778 --> 02:46:36,779
Look out.

1245
02:46:59,551 --> 02:47:00,802
Jesus Christ.

1246
02:52:24,292 --> 02:52:25,418
Fire!

1247
02:52:27,837 --> 02:52:28,923
Stop!

1248
02:52:44,188 --> 02:52:45,230
Listen up.

1249
02:52:45,314 --> 02:52:48,985
This is New York City,
and this is sacred ground.

1250
02:52:49,067 --> 02:52:50,528
You hear me?

1251
02:52:50,861 --> 02:52:53,406
It was built for humans, by humans.

1252
02:52:53,488 --> 02:52:55,907
Not for stinking lice-infested apes.

1253
02:52:56,367 --> 02:52:57,994
<i>The thought of some mutant gorilla</i>

1254
02:52:58,076 --> 02:53:02,790
<i>crapping all over the streets of this fair city,
fills me with disgust.</i>

1255
02:53:02,872 --> 02:53:04,750
<i>So this is how it's gonna be.</i>

1256
02:53:04,834 --> 02:53:07,253
We find it. We kill it.

1257
02:53:07,503 --> 02:53:10,590
We cut its ugly head off and we ram it up...

1258
02:53:30,900 --> 02:53:32,444
No. No.

1259
02:56:04,013 --> 02:56:05,346
Beautiful.

1260
02:56:11,771 --> 02:56:12,854
Yes.

1261
02:56:15,483 --> 02:56:16,859
Yes, it is.

1262
03:01:13,405 --> 03:01:14,531
Hey! Hey!

1263
03:01:14,781 --> 03:01:16,742
Nobody past this point.

1264
03:01:17,658 --> 03:01:19,536
You can't go in there!

1265
03:01:20,620 --> 03:01:21,621
Hey!

1266
03:01:23,748 --> 03:01:25,041
Stop him!

1267
03:01:28,128 --> 03:01:30,379
Hey! Get back.
You're not allowed up there!

1268
03:01:30,463 --> 03:01:32,131
- What's going on?
- Go!

1269
03:05:14,021 --> 03:05:15,314
No!

1270
03:05:16,480 --> 03:05:18,649
No!

1271
03:05:25,656 --> 03:05:28,284
Please! No!

1272
03:05:28,659 --> 03:05:29,827
No!

1273
03:08:26,462 --> 03:08:28,756
Ann. Ann.

1274
03:09:18,056 --> 03:09:19,390
Move along.

1275
03:09:19,849 --> 03:09:21,726
Just one shot! One shot!

1276
03:09:22,394 --> 03:09:24,478
- Come, come!
- Boys, how about a photo?

1277
03:09:24,563 --> 03:09:25,564
Look at me.

1278
03:09:25,689 --> 03:09:27,398
Come on, watch the camera.

1279
03:09:30,235 --> 03:09:31,778
Come a little closer.

1280
03:09:32,444 --> 03:09:34,656
That's it, folks. Show's over.
Step back!

1281
03:09:34,738 --> 03:09:36,907
Clear the area. That's it.
Shove off, boys.

1282
03:09:37,617 --> 03:09:39,201
Why'd he do that?

1283
03:09:39,494 --> 03:09:41,954
Climb up there
and get himself cornered.

1284
03:09:42,038 --> 03:09:44,332
The ape must have known
what was coming.

1285
03:09:44,415 --> 03:09:47,084
He's just a dumb animal
Didn't know nothing.

1286
03:09:53,299 --> 03:09:56,051
What does it matter?
Airplanes got him.

1287
03:09:58,596 --> 03:10:00,599
It wasn't the airplanes.

1288
03:10:04,935 --> 03:10:07,272
It was beauty killed the beast.

1289
03:14:19,816 --> 03:14:19,856
