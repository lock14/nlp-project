1
00:02:33,533 --> 00:02:39,301
This is Harvey Milk speaking
on Friday, November 18th.

2
00:02:40,673 --> 00:02:45,133
This is only to be played in the
event of my death by assassination.

3
00:02:48,881 --> 00:02:51,315
During one of
my early campaigns,

4
00:02:51,384 --> 00:02:57,289
I began to open speeches with a line
and it became kind of a signature.

5
00:02:57,957 --> 00:03:01,120
<i>My name is Harvey Milk
and I want to recruit you.</i>

6
00:03:02,895 --> 00:03:07,423
If I was speaking to a
slightly hostile audience

7
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,561
or a mostly straight one, I might
break the tension with a joke.

8
00:03:12,071 --> 00:03:14,471
I know. I know I'm
not what you expected,

9
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,132
but I left my
high heels at home.

10
00:03:19,645 --> 00:03:25,049
I fully realize that a person
who stands for what I stand for,

11
00:03:25,117 --> 00:03:26,584
an activist,
a gay activist,

12
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,448
<i>makes himself the target
for someone who is insecure,</i>

13
00:03:32,525 --> 00:03:35,653
<i>terrified, afraid
and disturbed themselves.</i>

14
00:03:35,728 --> 00:03:40,256
It's a very real possibility you
see, because in San Francisco,

15
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:44,133
we have broken a dam of major
prejudice in this country.

16
00:03:44,203 --> 00:03:47,229
<i>...room 200.
I'm in the mayor's office.</i>

17
00:03:47,306 --> 00:03:51,106
<i>We are trying
to ascertain what is happening.</i>

18
00:03:51,911 --> 00:03:54,038
As President of the
Board of Supervisors,

19
00:03:54,113 --> 00:03:56,547
it's my duty to
make this announcement.

20
00:03:57,483 --> 00:04:01,317
Both Mayor Moscone and
Supervisor Harvey Milk

21
00:04:02,355 --> 00:04:04,585
have been shot and killed.

22
00:04:08,661 --> 00:04:12,688
I wish I had time to explain
all the things that I did.

23
00:04:12,765 --> 00:04:15,700
Almost everything was done
with an eye on the gay movement.

24
00:04:25,244 --> 00:04:26,734
Hey. Hey.

25
00:04:28,714 --> 00:04:30,079
I'm Harvey.

26
00:04:30,516 --> 00:04:31,744
Okay, Harvey.

27
00:04:33,486 --> 00:04:34,851
Today's my birthday.

28
00:04:35,821 --> 00:04:39,518
No, hey, actually it is
my birthday. At midnight.

29
00:04:39,592 --> 00:04:40,650
Really?

30
00:04:41,494 --> 00:04:44,190
And, believe it or not,
I don't have any plans.

31
00:04:45,665 --> 00:04:48,133
Some people took
me out after work.

32
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:53,797
Hmm. And that would be at,
let me guess, Ma Bell or AT&T.

33
00:04:54,674 --> 00:04:56,539
The Great American
Insurance Company.

34
00:04:56,609 --> 00:04:57,701
Oh.

35
00:04:57,777 --> 00:05:00,803
I'm part of that corporate
establishment that,

36
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,815
let me guess, you think is the
cause of all the evil in the world,

37
00:05:03,883 --> 00:05:05,441
from Vietnam
to diaper rash.

38
00:05:05,518 --> 00:05:07,076
You left out bad breath.

39
00:05:10,356 --> 00:05:11,584
Just kidding.

40
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:17,787
You're not gonna let me spend my
birthday all by myself, are you?

41
00:05:20,466 --> 00:05:21,865
Listen, Harvey,

42
00:05:23,169 --> 00:05:25,160
you're pretty cute,

43
00:05:25,237 --> 00:05:27,205
but I don't
date guys over 40.

44
00:05:29,008 --> 00:05:31,340
Well, then, this
is my lucky night.

45
00:05:31,811 --> 00:05:33,176
Why is that?

46
00:05:33,245 --> 00:05:34,940
I'm still 39.

47
00:05:35,781 --> 00:05:37,476
It's only 11:15.

48
00:05:48,361 --> 00:05:49,658
Come on.

49
00:05:53,899 --> 00:05:55,662
What's your name?

50
00:05:55,735 --> 00:05:57,635
I'm Scott.

51
00:05:57,703 --> 00:06:00,638
Very nice to meet you,
Mr. Harvey, insurance man.

52
00:06:39,278 --> 00:06:41,439
Where are you from?

53
00:06:41,514 --> 00:06:43,345
Jackson, Mississippi.

54
00:06:45,418 --> 00:06:48,285
This isn't Jackson. You can't
respond to just every strange man

55
00:06:48,354 --> 00:06:49,981
that picks you up
on a subway platform.

56
00:06:50,055 --> 00:06:51,079
It's too dangerous.

57
00:06:51,157 --> 00:06:52,488
Hmm, now you tell me.

58
00:06:53,692 --> 00:06:55,421
The New York Police
are the toughest.

59
00:06:55,494 --> 00:06:57,223
They're arrogant
and they're everywhere.

60
00:06:57,296 --> 00:06:58,763
I'll show you all
the cruising spots,

61
00:06:58,831 --> 00:07:00,765
but you have to be very
careful, little Scotty-san.

62
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:03,199
Are you on
some uppers or something?

63
00:07:03,803 --> 00:07:06,601
No. This is
just plain me.

64
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,569
And you're scared
of the cops?

65
00:07:10,376 --> 00:07:12,901
I'm just discreet.
I know a lot of people.

66
00:07:12,978 --> 00:07:14,878
If they see me,
I could lose my job.

67
00:07:15,681 --> 00:07:17,410
Oh, you're one of those.

68
00:07:19,351 --> 00:07:23,447
Well, I think you need to find
a new scene. Some new friends.

69
00:07:26,459 --> 00:07:28,620
I need a change.
I know.

70
00:07:29,962 --> 00:07:31,589
Yeah, you're 40 now.

71
00:07:31,664 --> 00:07:32,653
Oh.

72
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:40,265
Forty years old and I haven't
done a thing I'm proud of.

73
00:07:40,339 --> 00:07:44,332
You keep eating this cake and you're
going to be fat by the time you're 50.

74
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:46,344
That's if I ever
get to 50. Oh!

75
00:07:47,012 --> 00:07:49,173
Happy birthday, old man.

76
00:07:53,652 --> 00:07:55,711
Why don't we
run away together?

77
00:07:55,788 --> 00:07:57,050
Where to?

78
00:08:10,936 --> 00:08:12,733
<i>HARVEY/ In the past, and still now,</i>

79
00:08:12,805 --> 00:08:16,138
<i>San Francisco was the place
where everyone wanted to go.</i>

80
00:08:16,742 --> 00:08:20,644
<i>To drop out,
to fall in love.</i>

81
00:08:21,814 --> 00:08:27,650
But by 1972, the Haight was boarded
up. Drug filled, crime filled.

82
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,245
The new place
for us refugees

83
00:08:30,322 --> 00:08:33,621
<i>was a little Irish Catholic
neighborhood in the Eureka Valley,</i>

84
00:08:34,693 --> 00:08:36,285
<i>six blocks square,</i>

85
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:39,225
<i>the Castro.</i>

86
00:09:24,977 --> 00:09:27,605
I cashed my last unemployment
check yesterday.

87
00:09:28,347 --> 00:09:31,180
Well, I hope you did
something useful with it.

88
00:09:32,885 --> 00:09:34,580
I bought
an ounce of pot.

89
00:09:34,653 --> 00:09:36,382
Don't
move for a second.

90
00:09:39,758 --> 00:09:41,988
I suppose
I can wait tables.

91
00:09:42,995 --> 00:09:44,519
I don't want you to go anywhere.

92
00:09:44,597 --> 00:09:47,031
I want you
right here with me.

93
00:09:48,033 --> 00:09:50,228
I was thinking
about a little shop.

94
00:09:50,302 --> 00:09:51,701
What kind of shop?

95
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:53,362
Just a little shop
with a little overhead.

96
00:09:53,439 --> 00:09:54,463
Not too much work.

97
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:57,202
Just like Morris and Minnie
Milk of Woodmere, New York.

98
00:09:57,876 --> 00:10:00,242
Did you see the little
place downstairs for rent?

99
00:10:00,312 --> 00:10:01,711
Yeah.

100
00:10:02,514 --> 00:10:04,072
What do you
think about that?

101
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:06,249
I think it sounds great.

102
00:10:06,318 --> 00:10:08,548
A little bit
up on the left.

103
00:10:13,926 --> 00:10:16,156
Oh, it looks great.
Looks great.

104
00:10:16,228 --> 00:10:17,559
Yeah.

105
00:10:18,163 --> 00:10:19,858
You're the
new renters?

106
00:10:20,633 --> 00:10:22,624
Well, hello.
Harvey Milk.

107
00:10:23,769 --> 00:10:25,134
McConnely.
Welcome to Castro Camera.

108
00:10:25,204 --> 00:10:26,466
Scott.

109
00:10:27,439 --> 00:10:29,407
Yeah. Like,
you know, I would like

110
00:10:29,475 --> 00:10:33,377
to join the, what's it called, The
Eureka Valley Merchants Association.

111
00:10:33,445 --> 00:10:34,639
I'm not an interloper.

112
00:10:34,713 --> 00:10:37,477
A Jew, perhaps, but I
hope you'll forgive that.

113
00:10:37,549 --> 00:10:39,039
If you open
those doors,

114
00:10:39,118 --> 00:10:42,087
the Merchants Association will
have the police pull your license.

115
00:10:42,154 --> 00:10:43,621
Under what law?

116
00:10:43,689 --> 00:10:45,384
Excuse me?

117
00:10:45,457 --> 00:10:48,517
There's man's law and there's
God's law in this neighborhood

118
00:10:48,594 --> 00:10:49,720
and in this city.

119
00:10:49,795 --> 00:10:51,319
You know,
we pay taxes.

120
00:10:51,397 --> 00:10:54,764
The San Francisco police force
is happy to enforce either.

121
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:55,891
Have a good day.

122
00:10:55,968 --> 00:10:59,131
Yeah, thank you for the warm
welcome to the neighborhood!

123
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:03,005
Schmuck!

124
00:11:03,842 --> 00:11:04,934
Well.

125
00:11:06,512 --> 00:11:07,672
Hey.

126
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,650
Okay.
Customers, come on in.

127
00:11:36,075 --> 00:11:38,839
We'll form our
own business association.

128
00:11:38,911 --> 00:11:41,106
We'll start with
the gay businesses.

129
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:45,082
We'll get the addresses of every customer
that comes in the store for a roll of film

130
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:48,517
and we'll ask them what they
want, what they need changed.

131
00:11:48,587 --> 00:11:51,750
We'll get some money rolling in
here. Revitalize the neighborhood.

132
00:11:51,824 --> 00:11:53,223
Can I come in now?

133
00:11:54,393 --> 00:11:55,985
One more minute.

134
00:11:58,297 --> 00:12:00,094
And I can go to
the neighborhood banks.

135
00:12:00,165 --> 00:12:02,065
They must have
some gay customers.

136
00:12:02,134 --> 00:12:05,797
Look, Harvey, what's with all
this political activist crap?

137
00:12:05,871 --> 00:12:08,431
I mean, I thought you
were a goddamn Republican.

138
00:12:08,507 --> 00:12:10,441
I'm a businessman, Scott.

139
00:12:10,509 --> 00:12:13,808
And businesses should be
good to their customers.

140
00:12:14,379 --> 00:12:16,677
Even if their
customers are gay.

141
00:12:16,749 --> 00:12:18,740
For God's sake,
it's San Francisco!

142
00:12:18,817 --> 00:12:21,650
Yeah. Well, it's just like
any other city in the country.

143
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,244
They hate us.
Real surprise.

144
00:12:23,322 --> 00:12:26,155
We should have at least one
block in one city, right?

145
00:12:26,225 --> 00:12:29,956
We start there and then we'll
take over the neighborhood.

146
00:12:30,028 --> 00:12:31,359
Maybe.

147
00:12:32,664 --> 00:12:33,892
I'm coming in.

148
00:12:33,966 --> 00:12:36,161
Okay,
you can come in now.

149
00:12:39,104 --> 00:12:41,504
Finally.
This better be good.

150
00:12:42,241 --> 00:12:43,572
Oh!

151
00:12:44,409 --> 00:12:45,808
Happy birthday!

152
00:12:48,814 --> 00:12:52,045
I had to do it! I had
to do it! I had to do it!

153
00:12:52,117 --> 00:12:54,244
Sanctuary, sanctuary!
Harvey Milk!

154
00:12:54,319 --> 00:12:55,308
Sanctuary!

155
00:12:55,854 --> 00:12:58,084
And Castro became
destination number one.

156
00:12:59,825 --> 00:13:03,625
Hundreds of gay men were coming
every week from all over the world.

157
00:13:04,329 --> 00:13:06,923
<i>It was our area.
Our own neighborhood.</i>

158
00:13:17,409 --> 00:13:20,640
<i>The police hated us. And
we hated them right back.</i>

159
00:13:21,313 --> 00:13:24,009
<i>They would come in and attack
us and beat us just for fun.</i>

160
00:13:24,082 --> 00:13:25,481
<i>But that wouldn't stop us.</i>

161
00:13:25,551 --> 00:13:29,715
<i>I made a list of shops that were
friendly to us and shops that weren't.</i>

162
00:13:29,788 --> 00:13:32,018
<i>Those shops that
worked with us thrived.</i>

163
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:34,388
<i>Those that didn't,
went out of business.</i>

164
00:13:34,459 --> 00:13:35,653
<i>Closed their doors.</i>

165
00:13:39,331 --> 00:13:41,356
Excuse me,
ladies and gentlemen.

166
00:13:41,433 --> 00:13:44,664
Mr. McConnely, I just came by
to see how business was doing.

167
00:13:44,736 --> 00:13:46,067
Just fine, Harvey.

168
00:13:46,138 --> 00:13:48,629
You don't mind having all
these homosexuals in here?

169
00:13:49,842 --> 00:13:52,276
Kidding, everybody. He
loves our kind. Spend away.

170
00:13:52,344 --> 00:13:53,675
Tell your wife I said hello.

171
00:13:55,247 --> 00:13:58,648
But people started
hanging around our store.

172
00:13:58,717 --> 00:14:01,652
Not customers.
Activists, kids,

173
00:14:02,521 --> 00:14:05,456
young people who were looking
for a home away from home.

174
00:14:26,778 --> 00:14:28,006
<i>There was Danny Nicoletta,</i>

175
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:31,675
<i>cute art student that I picked up
at Toad Hall, who worked in the shop.</i>

176
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:34,514
<i>Harvey, come on.
Opera is so passé.</i>

177
00:14:34,586 --> 00:14:35,985
You're not understanding
the spectacle of it,

178
00:14:36,054 --> 00:14:37,487
the bigger
than life emotions.

179
00:14:37,556 --> 00:14:39,456
The bigger
than life emotions?

180
00:14:44,663 --> 00:14:46,688
Jim Rivaldo, a great mind.

181
00:14:46,765 --> 00:14:51,930
Harvard graduate, which nobody cared
about in those days in the Castro.

182
00:14:52,004 --> 00:14:53,266
Including himself.

183
00:14:53,338 --> 00:14:56,205
<i>And somewhere along the
line, Jim picked up a protégé,</i>

184
00:14:56,275 --> 00:14:59,073
a cute political kid from
Wisconsin, Dick Pabich.

185
00:14:59,144 --> 00:15:01,544
And of course,
there was Dennis Peron,

186
00:15:01,613 --> 00:15:05,208
<i>who ran a very successful
business with the young kids.</i>

187
00:15:05,284 --> 00:15:08,515
And it wasn't only the gays
who noticed what was happening.

188
00:15:09,021 --> 00:15:10,545
Also the straight people.

189
00:15:11,556 --> 00:15:13,786
There were some
very unexpected ones.

190
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:17,988
Teamster leader Allan Baird
walked right into my shop

191
00:15:18,063 --> 00:15:22,090
<i>and asked me if I could get my
people to help boycott Coors beer.</i>

192
00:15:22,167 --> 00:15:24,761
<i>And the Coors beer boycott
had not been too successful.</i>

193
00:15:24,836 --> 00:15:29,034
<i>But I got my people to get all the
Coors beer out of all the gay bars,</i>

194
00:15:29,107 --> 00:15:32,599
<i>and immediately Coors fell
from number one and they caved.</i>

195
00:15:33,445 --> 00:15:36,710
<i>A week later, the Teamsters
union, for the very first time,</i>

196
00:15:36,782 --> 00:15:38,613
<i>hired openly gay drivers.</i>

197
00:15:38,684 --> 00:15:40,845
<i>We weren't just a bunch
of pansies anymore.</i>

198
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:43,251
<i>We had had our
first taste of power.</i>

199
00:15:43,322 --> 00:15:46,780
And it was about that time
that someone first called me

200
00:15:46,858 --> 00:15:51,693
the Mayor of Castro Street, or I
may have invented the term myself.

201
00:15:55,801 --> 00:15:57,428
The fucking cops, man.

202
00:15:57,502 --> 00:15:58,935
Cops are pulling
people out of Toad Hall.

203
00:15:59,004 --> 00:15:59,936
Why?
What did they do?

204
00:16:00,005 --> 00:16:01,734
They're sweeping the streets.
It's happening right now.

205
00:16:01,807 --> 00:16:03,172
Come on.
Come on.

206
00:16:28,433 --> 00:16:31,027
Through the door there,
the front door there,

207
00:16:31,103 --> 00:16:35,767
was just an explosion
of police charging in here.

208
00:16:35,841 --> 00:16:39,038
I ran into the bathroom to
hide with some other people.

209
00:16:39,878 --> 00:16:45,282
All we could hear was screaming
and crunching and smashing.

210
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:50,253
It was frankly the most terrifying
experience I've had in my life.

211
00:16:58,196 --> 00:16:59,720
If we had
someone in government

212
00:16:59,798 --> 00:17:02,733
who saw things the
way that we see them,

213
00:17:02,801 --> 00:17:07,363
like the black community has black
leaders that look out for their interests.

214
00:17:15,147 --> 00:17:17,240
Politics is theater.

215
00:17:17,315 --> 00:17:18,509
It doesn't matter
so much about winning.

216
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:19,607
You make a statement.

217
00:17:19,684 --> 00:17:23,313
You say, "I'm here. ' '
You get their attention.

218
00:17:25,123 --> 00:17:26,647
I mean, it'll be fun.

219
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:36,693
Even though the Castro was firmly our
area by 1973, it wasn't safe for us.

220
00:17:36,768 --> 00:17:40,704
We would have to wear whistles
on our necks or in our pockets.

221
00:17:40,772 --> 00:17:43,468
<i>And if you ever heard a
whistle, you would run to help.</i>

222
00:17:44,242 --> 00:17:47,973
Fruit was walking home with
his trick when he got jumped.

223
00:17:48,046 --> 00:17:50,606
Name's Robert Hillsborough.
Did you know him?

224
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:54,312
He used to come into my
shop. Are there any witnesses?

225
00:17:54,386 --> 00:17:56,684
Yeah, just
the trick, Jerry Taylor.

226
00:17:56,755 --> 00:17:59,280
Jerry's not his
trick, he's his lover.

227
00:17:59,357 --> 00:18:00,722
Hey,
call it what you will.

228
00:18:00,792 --> 00:18:04,250
All we know is he's our only witness and
he said he can't identify the attackers.

229
00:18:04,329 --> 00:18:06,695
Oh, you'd have a dozen witnesses
if they thought you boys had any

230
00:18:06,765 --> 00:18:08,790
real interest
in protecting them.

231
00:18:24,649 --> 00:18:27,743
<i>SCO TT ON PA/ Hey, come on. Come
over. Everyone gather around.</i>

232
00:18:27,819 --> 00:18:29,582
Hey, Milk,
good job on Coors.

233
00:18:29,654 --> 00:18:32,919
Thank you and we were very happy to
do that. We were very happy to do that.

234
00:18:32,991 --> 00:18:35,016
<i>Everyone over here,
gather around.</i>

235
00:18:40,098 --> 00:18:43,261
<i>Hello. I'm Harvey Milk.</i>

236
00:18:46,638 --> 00:18:48,128
<i>A week ago,</i>

237
00:18:49,674 --> 00:18:53,804
<i>police officers came into
our area with badges covered.</i>

238
00:18:55,347 --> 00:19:00,375
<i>They sent 14 of our people
to hospitals and to jail.</i>

239
00:19:00,452 --> 00:19:04,013
<i>The charges,
"Blocking the sidewalk. "</i>

240
00:19:06,191 --> 00:19:10,821
<i>Let's let our tax money go to our
protection, not our persecution.</i>

241
00:19:11,563 --> 00:19:15,021
<i>Worry about gun control,
not marijuana control.</i>

242
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:18,797
<i>School supplies, seniors,
not the books we read!</i>

243
00:19:24,142 --> 00:19:25,939
<i>My fellow degenerates,</i>

244
00:19:27,345 --> 00:19:32,783
<i>I would like to announce my candidacy
for San Francisco City Supervisor!</i>

245
00:19:37,255 --> 00:19:39,348
How are you, Lee?
Fine, thank you.

246
00:19:39,424 --> 00:19:41,415
Oh, I bought you some flowers
to brighten up your day.

247
00:19:41,493 --> 00:19:43,961
Could I leave some
flyers for your customers?

248
00:19:44,763 --> 00:19:45,923
Hello, everyone.

249
00:19:45,997 --> 00:19:47,521
Harvey Milk,
running for supervisor.

250
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:49,089
<i>We need your support.</i>

251
00:19:49,167 --> 00:19:51,135
Are you registered
to vote?

252
00:19:51,203 --> 00:19:53,433
Let me just give you that. It's for
Harvey Milk for supervisor, all right?

253
00:19:53,505 --> 00:19:55,973
<i>He's running for the Board of
Supervisors. Right. Thank you.</i>

254
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:57,201
<i>Take care.
Have a good day.</i>

255
00:19:57,275 --> 00:20:01,974
Harvey Milk for supervisor! Excuse
me, ma'am, are you registered to vote?

256
00:20:02,047 --> 00:20:03,639
Sir, are you
registered to vote?

257
00:20:03,715 --> 00:20:06,183
I'm Harvey Milk, sir.
I'm running for supervisor.

258
00:20:06,251 --> 00:20:08,776
I want you to know that my
campaign is very interested

259
00:20:08,853 --> 00:20:10,548
in taking care of
seniors in the area.

260
00:20:10,622 --> 00:20:12,146
<i>We've been doing
a lot about reaching out.</i>

261
00:20:12,224 --> 00:20:15,887
I'm Harvey Milk. Will you register
here if you're not registered?

262
00:20:16,494 --> 00:20:21,193
Hey, I like the way those pants
fit! Where are you from, kid?

263
00:20:21,266 --> 00:20:23,530
Sorry, old man,
not interested.

264
00:20:23,602 --> 00:20:25,661
Where's home?

265
00:20:25,737 --> 00:20:27,295
Phoenix.

266
00:20:27,372 --> 00:20:29,966
Come here.
Just come here a minute.

267
00:20:32,811 --> 00:20:35,644
I'm Harvey Milk. I'm
running for supervisor.

268
00:20:35,714 --> 00:20:36,840
What's your name?

269
00:20:36,915 --> 00:20:38,780
Cleve Jones.

270
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:41,080
Cleve Jones.
You're adorable.

271
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:45,112
We should get you over here and
get you registered, Mr. Jones.

272
00:20:46,391 --> 00:20:48,086
Fuck that.
Elections of any kind

273
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,252
are fucking
bourgeois affectation.

274
00:20:50,328 --> 00:20:51,989
Is that right?
Mmm-hmm.

275
00:20:52,063 --> 00:20:54,361
What do you do,
trick up on Polk Street?

276
00:20:57,469 --> 00:20:59,494
If I need the cash.

277
00:20:59,571 --> 00:21:02,039
But I'm a little bit more selective
about my clients than you are.

278
00:21:02,107 --> 00:21:04,871
Okay, let me ask you one thing
before you go back to work.

279
00:21:04,943 --> 00:21:07,036
What was it like to be
a little queer in Phoenix?

280
00:21:07,112 --> 00:21:09,603
Did all the jocks beat
you up in gym class?

281
00:21:13,351 --> 00:21:16,081
I faked a lung disease
to get out of P.E.

282
00:21:16,154 --> 00:21:18,782
So what, what are you?
Some kind of street shrink?

283
00:21:18,857 --> 00:21:20,290
Sometimes.

284
00:21:20,358 --> 00:21:23,486
But what I'm talking about
is that we can change Phoenix.

285
00:21:23,962 --> 00:21:26,157
But we have to
start with our street.

286
00:21:27,832 --> 00:21:32,929
Police abuse, rent control,
pot, parks, seniors issues.

287
00:21:33,004 --> 00:21:34,904
Good luck
with all that.

288
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,566
Good luck.

289
00:21:38,376 --> 00:21:40,241
You know what I think,
Cleve Jones?

290
00:21:40,312 --> 00:21:42,143
That you're gonna get
somewhere if you keep talking.

291
00:21:42,213 --> 00:21:44,443
No. I think you should
do what you do well.

292
00:21:44,516 --> 00:21:46,040
You should
be a prick.

293
00:21:46,117 --> 00:21:50,213
But come with us and be a prick.
Fight City Hall. Fight the cops.

294
00:21:50,288 --> 00:21:52,813
Fight the people that made you
come here to do what you do.

295
00:21:52,891 --> 00:21:55,758
Sorry, old man, I'm leaving
for Spain tomorrow. Europe.

296
00:21:55,827 --> 00:21:58,227
All the cash I need
is in my back pocket.

297
00:22:07,272 --> 00:22:10,400
I'm just saying that at this point,
it looks like all the big guns,

298
00:22:10,475 --> 00:22:12,033
all the gay money,
the real money,

299
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,475
is gonna get
behind Feinstein

300
00:22:13,545 --> 00:22:15,069
and all the straight candidates
they consider "gay-friendly. ' '

301
00:22:15,146 --> 00:22:16,977
Who cares about
those old queens?

302
00:22:17,048 --> 00:22:18,174
Well, you need
them to get elected.

303
00:22:18,249 --> 00:22:21,047
Why isn't my campaign
manager leading this meeting?

304
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:23,747
'Cause I'm exhausted. I've been
handing out pamphlets for seven hours.

305
00:22:23,822 --> 00:22:25,084
Yeah, in a bathhouse.

306
00:22:25,156 --> 00:22:27,056
And who are these so-called
gay leaders anyway?

307
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:29,650
Who appointed them?
What are you suggesting, Jim?

308
00:22:29,728 --> 00:22:31,923
That I go down there and
solicit their endorsement?

309
00:22:31,996 --> 00:22:35,124
I mean, we're down here trying to help
people on the streets. Where are they?

310
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,395
Yeah, I know, but... You
need an endorsement, Harvey.

311
00:22:37,469 --> 00:22:38,731
Take this.

312
00:22:38,803 --> 00:22:40,100
Checking the exposure.

313
00:22:40,171 --> 00:22:42,139
They're nice pictures.

314
00:22:42,207 --> 00:22:44,107
Is he your boyfriend?
Sort of.

315
00:22:44,542 --> 00:22:46,942
<i>Harvey, David Goodstein is a
publisher from The Advocate.</i>

316
00:22:47,011 --> 00:22:48,410
Harvey.
He's got a house...

317
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,678
Harvey, I think
you got to see this.

318
00:22:56,554 --> 00:22:58,988

have a dream journey

319
00:22:59,057 --> 00:23:02,117
"and nightmare to hell,

320
00:23:02,193 --> 00:23:07,290
"You will be stabbed and have your
genitals, cock, balls and prick cut off. ' '

321
00:23:08,466 --> 00:23:09,728
I'm calling the police.

322
00:23:09,801 --> 00:23:13,464
They probably wrote it.
Look, think of it this way.

323
00:23:13,538 --> 00:23:15,472
If they try to kill me,
I'll get the sympathy vote.

324
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,872
That might be
just the push we need.

325
00:23:17,942 --> 00:23:20,638
You think this is funny?
Look at it.

326
00:23:23,348 --> 00:23:24,610
It's a total joke.

327
00:23:24,682 --> 00:23:27,776
I mean, it's got no rhythm,
no humor. It's insulting.

328
00:23:31,523 --> 00:23:32,547
Don't do that.

329
00:23:32,624 --> 00:23:34,251
No, if you put it away,
you put it in a drawer,

330
00:23:34,325 --> 00:23:36,293
it just gets
bigger and scarier.

331
00:23:36,361 --> 00:23:39,262
Here, it's right here. We see
it every day. It can't get us.

332
00:23:41,099 --> 00:23:44,034
Gonna spend all this energy
to make yourself a target?

333
00:23:44,102 --> 00:23:45,899
For something you're
not gonna even win?

334
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:49,064
I keep telling you, it's
not just about winning.

00:23:59,317 --> 00:24:02,013
Hello. Hello, welcome
to Mr. Goodstein's.

339
00:24:02,086 --> 00:24:03,178
Milo.

340
00:24:04,923 --> 00:24:07,323
I worked for a financial
institution in New York.

341
00:24:07,392 --> 00:24:08,916
I was very discreet.

342
00:24:08,993 --> 00:24:11,052
One night I went to
the Metropolitan Opera,

343
00:24:11,129 --> 00:24:13,097
<i>II Trovatore, Verdi.</i>

344
00:24:13,164 --> 00:24:15,530
I was sitting in a
box, next to my lover.

345
00:24:16,334 --> 00:24:19,098
Someone spotted us.
Next day I was fired.

346
00:24:20,438 --> 00:24:22,269
So I decided to do
something about it.

347
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:25,207
<i>Came out here to San Francisco,
I bought The Advocate.</i>

348
00:24:25,643 --> 00:24:30,512
I use my money and my influence, in very
subtle and quiet ways, to do what I can.

349
00:24:31,316 --> 00:24:33,079
So you think that backing
straight candidates

350
00:24:33,151 --> 00:24:34,345
is the best
way to help us?

351
00:24:34,419 --> 00:24:36,387
Yeah, if they're
friendly to our cause.

352
00:24:36,454 --> 00:24:38,388
Supervisor is
a citywide office.

353
00:24:38,456 --> 00:24:40,185
Political alliances
have to be built.

354
00:24:40,258 --> 00:24:44,388
You can't just move here from across
the country and run for that office.

355
00:24:44,462 --> 00:24:45,929
But I am running for office.

356
00:24:45,997 --> 00:24:47,294
I'm on the ballot.

357
00:24:47,365 --> 00:24:49,492
I have the union rank and
file, I have the seniors.

358
00:24:49,567 --> 00:24:52,365
And I would like to have
your magazine's endorsement.

359
00:24:53,872 --> 00:24:56,807
Harvey, we're like
the Catholic church.

360
00:24:56,875 --> 00:25:00,402
We welcome converts, but we
don't make them Pope the same day.

361
00:25:00,478 --> 00:25:02,571
Why haven't
you run yet?

362
00:25:02,647 --> 00:25:05,616
Too early.
Especially from the Castro.

363
00:25:07,085 --> 00:25:08,518
What's wrong
with the Castro?

364
00:25:08,586 --> 00:25:11,521
Nobody works there. It's all
about sex and drugs and more sex.

365
00:25:11,589 --> 00:25:13,887
David, we need one
of our own in office.

366
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:19,863
Harvey, you can't demand
acceptance overnight.

367
00:25:19,931 --> 00:25:21,057
Why not?

368
00:25:21,132 --> 00:25:23,828
The more "out" you make us,
the more you incite them.

369
00:25:23,902 --> 00:25:26,803
Harvey, step back and quiet down.

370
00:25:26,871 --> 00:25:29,032
You're suggesting we should
go back in the closet?

371
00:25:29,107 --> 00:25:30,506
Is that what
you're saying?

372
00:25:30,575 --> 00:25:33,544
I spent more years in the
closet than I care to remember.

373
00:25:33,611 --> 00:25:35,238
Let's go, Scott.
Yeah.

374
00:25:35,313 --> 00:25:36,746
I don't need your
magazine's endorsement.

375
00:25:36,814 --> 00:25:39,908
And I'm not asking for anyone's
acceptance. I don't have time.

376
00:25:40,485 --> 00:25:43,511
For you,
politics is a game, a lark.

377
00:25:43,588 --> 00:25:46,421
It's like putting on a rock
festival or staging a love-in.

378
00:25:46,491 --> 00:25:48,584
You're too old to be
a hippie, Harvey Milk.

379
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:51,595
I am not a candidate.
I am part of a movement.

380
00:25:51,663 --> 00:25:54,689
The movement is the candidate.
There is a difference.

381
00:25:54,766 --> 00:25:56,700
You don't see it,
but I do.

382
00:25:58,836 --> 00:26:00,929
Sorry, I, uh,
pissed in the pool.

383
00:26:02,607 --> 00:26:07,704
So, on election day, out of 32
candidates vying for six seats,

384
00:26:07,779 --> 00:26:11,078
<i>we came in tenth.
We lost.</i>

385
00:26:11,149 --> 00:26:17,952
But only a few votes shy of my becoming
the first big eared, cock-sucking,

386
00:26:19,057 --> 00:26:21,958
queer as a
three-dollar-bill-man

387
00:26:22,026 --> 00:26:24,051
<i>to be elected
to public office.</i>

388
00:26:25,196 --> 00:26:28,324
So we decided to
try it again in 1975.

389
00:26:30,134 --> 00:26:32,193
<i>Only this time,
with a few adjustments.</i>

390
00:26:34,272 --> 00:26:38,299
No. No, not cute. I hate the shoes.

391
00:26:38,376 --> 00:26:40,207
I hate the hair.
You're not fooling anybody.

392
00:26:40,278 --> 00:26:42,542
I'm not gonna let those
little Pacific Heights biddies

393
00:26:42,614 --> 00:26:45,412
write me off anymore because
of a ponytail. I like it.

394
00:26:45,483 --> 00:26:50,045
No more bathhouses, no more
pot, for me and my little poo.

395
00:26:52,023 --> 00:26:53,354
Speak for yourself.
Come on.

396
00:26:53,424 --> 00:27:00,592
We ran and lost the supervisor's
race for the second time in 1975,

397
00:27:00,665 --> 00:27:03,657
but with more votes than ever before.

398
00:27:04,369 --> 00:27:09,602
So in 1976,
against everyone's advice,

399
00:27:09,674 --> 00:27:12,871
<i>I really pissed off
the political power houses</i>

400
00:27:12,944 --> 00:27:16,004
<i>in the Democratic party by
running against their man,</i>

401
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,675
<i>Art Agnos, who was part
of their political machine.</i>

402
00:27:19,751 --> 00:27:22,811
<i>And this time, not for
supervisor, but for a bigger job,</i>

403
00:27:22,887 --> 00:27:24,684
<i>for the California
State Assembly.</i>

404
00:27:24,756 --> 00:27:28,021
I don't think that State Assembly
seats should be the reward

405
00:27:28,092 --> 00:27:29,957
for service to the
Democratic party machine.

406
00:27:30,028 --> 00:27:32,622
Machines run on oil and
grease. They're dirty.

407
00:27:33,164 --> 00:27:37,157
They're dehumanizing. And they
tend to be entirely unresponsive

408
00:27:37,235 --> 00:27:40,261
to the needs of anybody,
but those of their operator.

409
00:27:40,705 --> 00:27:44,334
Mr. Milk, I've been a social
worker in this city for years.

410
00:27:44,409 --> 00:27:46,206
I know Sacramento.

411
00:27:46,277 --> 00:27:48,745
I know how to get done
what we all need done there.

412
00:27:48,813 --> 00:27:52,510
Tell me something, Mr. Agnos,
right here in the Castro,

413
00:27:52,583 --> 00:27:57,350
Robert Hillsbourough was murdered for
walking home with his longtime partner.

414
00:27:57,422 --> 00:27:59,287
He was stabbed 15 times.

415
00:28:00,024 --> 00:28:04,825
The last words he heard were,
"Faggot, faggot, faggot. ' '

416
00:28:04,896 --> 00:28:08,593
Now, you say
you're outraged.

417
00:28:10,034 --> 00:28:15,165
Why then does your liberal
establishment refuse to answer our calls?

418
00:28:15,239 --> 00:28:17,969
Why do they not bring
these murderers to justice?

419
00:28:21,779 --> 00:28:23,644
My God, you're handsome up close.

420
00:28:24,782 --> 00:28:27,649
Can't tell you how much I'm
looking forward to licking you,

421
00:28:27,719 --> 00:28:28,981
in the polls.

422
00:28:30,154 --> 00:28:32,952
You know, Harv, your
whole rap's a real downer.

423
00:28:33,991 --> 00:28:36,255
You talk a lot about
what you're against.

424
00:28:36,327 --> 00:28:37,919
But what are you for?

425
00:28:37,995 --> 00:28:42,364
In this town, you got to give them a
reason for optimism, or you're cooked.

426
00:28:46,437 --> 00:28:48,302
See you around.

427
00:28:48,372 --> 00:28:49,304
Okay, Art.

428
00:28:49,974 --> 00:28:51,805
You're gonna wanna
read that entire thing.

429
00:28:51,876 --> 00:28:53,207
Okay,
I'll take a look at it.

430
00:28:53,277 --> 00:28:54,642
Excuse me.

431
00:28:54,712 --> 00:28:56,680
Guys.
Don't touch that.

432
00:28:57,315 --> 00:29:00,375
Harvey. Harvey, dinner. Have
to get some union boys in there.

433
00:29:00,451 --> 00:29:02,885
They love me,
they love me.

434
00:29:06,224 --> 00:29:08,556
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

435
00:29:10,128 --> 00:29:12,221
Harvey, you have to eat.

436
00:29:12,296 --> 00:29:15,356
Everyone, the apartment
is now off limits!

437
00:29:15,433 --> 00:29:17,264
Good night.
Good night.

438
00:29:18,503 --> 00:29:20,437
Good night.
Whose jacket is this?

439
00:29:20,505 --> 00:29:22,336
Right here.
Here you go. Good night.

440
00:29:22,406 --> 00:29:25,204
Down the stairs.
Thank you. Thank you.

441
00:29:26,978 --> 00:29:28,377
Good night. Thank you.

442
00:29:28,446 --> 00:29:30,141
I think you got to call the guy,
'cause I can't talk to that guy.

443
00:29:30,214 --> 00:29:31,772
Sit.

444
00:29:33,084 --> 00:29:35,484
Don't say anything.

445
00:29:46,664 --> 00:29:48,029
Can I just tell you...

446
00:29:48,099 --> 00:29:51,262
If you say anything about
politics or the campaign,

447
00:29:51,335 --> 00:29:53,530
or what speech you
have to give or anything,

448
00:29:53,604 --> 00:29:56,164
I swear to God I'm gonna
stab you with this fork.

449
00:29:57,241 --> 00:30:03,237
I just wanted to say that this is the
most wonderful dinner I have ever had.

450
00:30:08,019 --> 00:30:11,955
If we lose this, it'll
just be you and me again.

451
00:30:12,023 --> 00:30:13,888
I promise.

452
00:30:13,958 --> 00:30:15,687
I'm sorry, I just...

453
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:19,890
No, I know.
I know, I know.

454
00:31:23,461 --> 00:31:24,689
Phoenix.

455
00:31:25,363 --> 00:31:27,194
At least now
you look gay.

456
00:31:34,572 --> 00:31:36,199
Let's go inside.

457
00:31:47,318 --> 00:31:49,411
Are you
staying up with me?

458
00:31:52,023 --> 00:31:54,651
The election's tomorrow.
I won't sleep anyway.

459
00:32:03,301 --> 00:32:04,563
Was he handsome?

460
00:32:04,635 --> 00:32:07,832
Oh, no!
He was hideous.

461
00:32:10,241 --> 00:32:14,610
Usually when my lovers leave, they
cheat with even more attractive men.

462
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:24,513
I actually thought we were gonna
spend the rest of our lives together.

463
00:32:30,928 --> 00:32:32,862
Well, guess what, Cleve Jones.

464
00:32:34,298 --> 00:32:35,390
What?

465
00:32:35,466 --> 00:32:39,596
You're going to meet the
most extraordinary men,

466
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:42,935
the sexiest, funniest, brightest men.

467
00:32:43,007 --> 00:32:45,532
You're going to meet so many of them,
fall in love with so many of them,

468
00:32:45,609 --> 00:32:47,167
you won't know till
the end of your life

469
00:32:47,244 --> 00:32:50,771
which ones were your greatest lovers
and which were your greatest friends.

470
00:32:51,983 --> 00:32:53,780
Is that supposed to help?

471
00:32:54,418 --> 00:32:57,182
Maybe a little. Or not.

472
00:33:07,131 --> 00:33:09,964
I went to
Spain last month.

473
00:33:10,034 --> 00:33:11,365
Long story.

474
00:33:15,439 --> 00:33:18,306
In Barcelona, there
was this memorial march

475
00:33:18,376 --> 00:33:20,970
for gay people that
had died under Franco.

476
00:33:22,446 --> 00:33:24,778
Of course, the police
tried to break it up.

477
00:33:24,849 --> 00:33:26,908
But these queens didn't run.
No.

478
00:33:26,984 --> 00:33:30,420
They turned around and
they started a fucking riot.

479
00:33:30,488 --> 00:33:33,321
I saw a bullet, one of
those big rubber bullets

480
00:33:33,391 --> 00:33:37,487
rip through a drag queen's
scalp, but she kept on fighting.

481
00:33:38,062 --> 00:33:41,088
She was screaming,
but she kept on fighting.

482
00:33:42,299 --> 00:33:43,288
I mean...

483
00:33:45,469 --> 00:33:46,834
Our lives.

484
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:52,707
There was blood literally
running in the gutter.

485
00:33:54,545 --> 00:33:56,274
In a gutter.

486
00:34:00,117 --> 00:34:02,813
We could have
a revolution here.

487
00:34:04,989 --> 00:34:08,481
But you can't use the
Castro just to cruise.

488
00:34:09,427 --> 00:34:10,985
You have to fight.

489
00:34:14,231 --> 00:34:15,823
You really think you'll win?

490
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:18,994
Winning is
not my strong suit.

491
00:34:20,104 --> 00:34:21,469
Well,

492
00:34:23,174 --> 00:34:25,472
I don't do losing, ever.

493
00:34:25,543 --> 00:34:28,842
Maybe I should run for office
and you can work for me.

494
00:34:28,913 --> 00:34:31,074
I mean, if you can do it...

495
00:34:31,148 --> 00:34:33,309
Can you assemble a
thousand people in an hour?

496
00:34:33,384 --> 00:34:34,510
Fuck, yeah.

497
00:34:34,585 --> 00:34:37,110
Well, if I run again,
you're gonna be my man.

498
00:34:38,289 --> 00:34:39,449
Lf?

499
00:34:40,424 --> 00:34:42,085
You're so adorable.

500
00:34:44,261 --> 00:34:46,229
The polls are open in 3 hours.

501
00:34:47,164 --> 00:34:49,428
How about you and
I hit the bus stops?

502
00:34:51,302 --> 00:34:52,291
Okay.

503
00:34:54,105 --> 00:34:59,008
<i>Yes, Jesus</i>

504
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:02,176
<i>Loves me</i>

505
00:35:02,246 --> 00:35:05,613
<i>Anita Bryant was once
known as an orange juice saleswoman.</i>

00:35:05,683 --> 00:35:09,278
<i>Hi, I'm Anita Bryant.</i>

507
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:11,310
<i>Hello, I'm Anita Bryant.</i>

508
00:35:11,388 --> 00:35:13,788
<i>With a religious fervor
that has made her America's most</i>

509
00:35:13,858 --> 00:35:15,655
<i>controversial woman overnight,</i>

510
00:35:15,726 --> 00:35:18,923
<i>her group is crusading to
repeal a new Dade County law,</i>

511
00:35:18,996 --> 00:35:21,726
<i>which protects homosexuals
in jobs and housing.</i>

512
00:35:21,799 --> 00:35:26,566
<i>I believe that more than ever
before, that there are evil forces</i>

513
00:35:29,707 --> 00:35:31,174
<i>round about us,</i>

514
00:35:32,443 --> 00:35:35,173
<i>even perhaps disguised
as something good,</i>

515
00:35:37,281 --> 00:35:39,841
<i>that would
want to tear down</i>

516
00:35:39,917 --> 00:35:44,513
<i>the very foundation, the family
unit, that holds America together.</i>

517
00:35:44,588 --> 00:35:46,385
<i>There are those people
who say that it is</i>

518
00:35:46,457 --> 00:35:48,857
<i>kind of an eye for an eye
law that is at work here,</i>

519
00:35:48,926 --> 00:35:51,451
<i>that you're denying homosexuals
many of their rights as well.</i>

520
00:35:51,529 --> 00:35:54,521
<i>You see, if homosexuals are
allowed their civil rights,</i>

521
00:35:54,598 --> 00:35:57,465
<i>then so would prostitutes
or thieves or anyone else.</i>

522
00:35:57,535 --> 00:35:59,799
<i>God puts it in
a category of morality.</i>

523
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:02,031
<i>Doesn't that necessarily
follow that you believe that</i>

524
00:36:02,106 --> 00:36:03,767
<i>homosexuality
ought to be illegal?</i>

525
00:36:03,841 --> 00:36:06,309
<i>ANITA/ I do believe that
it should be illegal.</i>

526
00:36:06,377 --> 00:36:08,777
Well, we lost, but
we didn't lose by much.

527
00:36:09,513 --> 00:36:11,879
More votes than ever!

528
00:36:14,919 --> 00:36:16,750
That used to
make you laugh.

529
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:21,517
Harvey, I got to
show you something.

530
00:36:22,993 --> 00:36:24,460
This is incredible.

531
00:36:27,665 --> 00:36:31,692
If we can get that new initiative
on district elections to go through,

532
00:36:31,769 --> 00:36:34,237
and we can, we can,

533
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:39,140
the boundary for the
new supervisor district

534
00:36:40,744 --> 00:36:42,939
is gonna go right
down Market Street,

535
00:36:45,082 --> 00:36:49,018
right around the
Haight like this,

536
00:36:51,889 --> 00:36:55,450
and right around
the Castro.

537
00:36:58,395 --> 00:37:00,955
The Haight and the Castro.
That's it.

538
00:37:01,999 --> 00:37:06,527
If these are the only people we have
to convince, the hippies and the gays,

539
00:37:07,471 --> 00:37:09,996
you win, you win.

540
00:37:11,508 --> 00:37:13,305
You win by a landslide.

541
00:37:17,281 --> 00:37:22,719
You'll be the first openly gay man
elected to major office in the U.S.

542
00:37:26,423 --> 00:37:29,881
I don't know if I
have another one in me.

543
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,518
Or Scotty.

544
00:37:34,632 --> 00:37:35,826
Yeah, well.

545
00:37:48,245 --> 00:37:51,806
Relentless man.
Oh, you're a relentless man.

546
00:37:58,289 --> 00:38:02,419
<i>This is the CBS
Evening News with Walter Cronkite.</i>

547
00:38:02,493 --> 00:38:06,156
<i>The battle over homosexual
rights in Dade County, Florida.</i>

548
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:08,095
<i>The battle pitting
singer Anita Bryant</i>

549
00:38:08,165 --> 00:38:11,862
<i>against gay rights activist
comes to a vote there Tuesday.</i>

550
00:38:11,935 --> 00:38:15,336
<i>The issue was whether or not to
repeal a four-month-old ordinance,</i>

551
00:38:15,406 --> 00:38:19,433
<i>which prohibits job and housing
discrimination against homosexuals.</i>

552
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:20,977
<i>In
anticipation of the vote,</i>

553
00:38:21,045 --> 00:38:23,036
<i>the gay community
has staged protests</i>

554
00:38:23,113 --> 00:38:26,480
<i>in New York and other major
cities across the country.</i>

555
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:30,316
<i>The vote is
going now 18,930 for repeal.</i>

556
00:38:30,387 --> 00:38:32,116
Oh, give me
a fucking break.

557
00:38:32,189 --> 00:38:34,180
<i>Eighty eight hundred
sixty nine against repeal.</i>

558
00:38:34,258 --> 00:38:37,421
<i>Virgil, is that enough for
you to make a projection?</i>

559
00:38:37,494 --> 00:38:43,126
<i>Yes, I think very definitely that
the ordinance is going to be repealed.</i>

560
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,395
<i>With this margin, it's over.</i>

561
00:38:45,469 --> 00:38:49,166
<i>Tonight, the laws of God</i>

562
00:38:49,239 --> 00:38:53,335
<i>and the cultural values
of man have been vindicated.</i>

563
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:57,073
<i>The people of Dade County,
the normal majority,</i>

564
00:38:57,147 --> 00:39:02,016

"Enough, enough, enough. "</i>

Scotty?

567
00:39:14,231 --> 00:39:16,665
I'm sorry, sir, I read
about you in the paper.

568
00:39:16,734 --> 00:39:19,202
<i>I'm sorry.
I can't talk right now.</i>

569
00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:21,328
Sir, I think I'm
gonna kill myself.

570
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,699
No. You don't
want to do that.

571
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:28,441
Where are you calling from?

572
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:29,809
<i>Minnesota.</i>

573
00:39:31,715 --> 00:39:34,479
You saw my picture in
the paper in Minnesota?

574
00:39:34,551 --> 00:39:35,575
How did I look?

575
00:39:35,652 --> 00:39:41,284
<i>My folks are gonna take me to this
place tomorrow. A hospital. To fix me.</i>

576
00:39:43,894 --> 00:39:46,260
There's nothing wrong
with you. Listen to me.

577
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:49,060
<i>You just get on a bus to
the nearest biggest city.</i>

578
00:39:49,133 --> 00:39:52,000
<i>Los Angeles or New
York or San Francisco,</i>

579
00:39:52,069 --> 00:39:53,536
<i>it doesn't matter,
you just leave.</i>

580
00:39:53,604 --> 00:39:56,072
And you are not sick,

581
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:58,973
and you are not wrong
and God does not hate you.

582
00:39:59,343 --> 00:40:00,401
Just leave.

583
00:40:02,846 --> 00:40:05,815
I can't.
I can't walk, sir.

584
00:40:05,883 --> 00:40:07,942
Paul, I need
you to come out here.

585
00:40:08,018 --> 00:40:09,076
Hello?

586
00:40:09,153 --> 00:40:11,144
Harvey!

587
00:40:11,221 --> 00:40:12,279
Hello?

588
00:40:13,624 --> 00:40:15,148
Oh, shit.

589
00:40:15,225 --> 00:40:18,353
Harvey, you better come down,
there's going to be a riot.

590
00:40:31,508 --> 00:40:33,669
Harvey, you should get to the stage.

591
00:40:33,744 --> 00:40:35,439
Bring him the stage, guys.

592
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:39,276
If you can't control
them, we will.

593
00:40:39,349 --> 00:40:41,749
Just get me permission
to march them.

594
00:40:41,819 --> 00:40:43,218
Where?

595
00:40:43,287 --> 00:40:44,379
Anywhere.

596
00:40:58,635 --> 00:41:00,603
Out of the bar
and into the streets!

597
00:41:00,671 --> 00:41:03,003
Anita Bryant's
coming for you!

598
00:41:04,374 --> 00:41:06,308
Out of the bar
and into the streets!

599
00:41:06,376 --> 00:41:08,674
Anita Bryant's
coming for you!

600
00:41:08,745 --> 00:41:28,631
We have vowed
to fight back!

601
00:41:36,607 --> 00:41:38,700
<i>I know you are angry.</i>

602
00:41:43,213 --> 00:41:45,044
<i>I am angry!</i>

603
00:41:47,084 --> 00:41:53,421
<i>Let's march the streets of San
Francisco and share our anger!</i>

604
00:42:01,598 --> 00:42:03,463
Gay rights now!

605
00:42:03,534 --> 00:42:06,799
Gay rights now!
Gay rights now!

606
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:11,500
Gay rights now! Gay
rights now! Gay rights now!

607
00:42:11,575 --> 00:42:14,373
Gay rights now!
Gay rights now!

608
00:42:14,444 --> 00:42:16,002
Gay rights now!

609
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:17,546
<i>Gay rights now!</i>

610
00:42:17,614 --> 00:42:18,638
<i>Gay rights now!
Gay rights now!</i>

611
00:42:18,715 --> 00:42:28,314
Gay rights now!
Gay rights now!

612
00:42:28,725 --> 00:42:34,893
Gay rights now!
Gay rights now!

613
00:42:50,013 --> 00:42:52,573
<i>My name is Harvey Milk
and I want to recruit you.</i>

614
00:42:55,886 --> 00:42:58,081
<i>I am here tonight to say</i>

615
00:42:59,056 --> 00:43:03,390
<i>that we will no longer
sit quietly in the closet.</i>

616
00:43:04,595 --> 00:43:06,654
<i>We must fight.</i>

617
00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:09,392
<i>And not only
in the Castro,</i>

618
00:43:09,466 --> 00:43:12,697
<i>not only in
San Francisco,</i>

619
00:43:12,769 --> 00:43:15,397
<i>but everywhere
the Anitas go.</i>

620
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,634
<i>Anita Bryant
did not win tonight.</i>

621
00:43:20,077 --> 00:43:23,513
<i>Anita Bryant
brought us together!</i>

622
00:43:26,216 --> 00:43:32,416
<i>She is going to create
a national gay force!</i>

623
00:43:37,361 --> 00:43:42,526
<i>And the young people
in Jackson, Mississippi,</i>

624
00:43:43,867 --> 00:43:47,428
<i>in Minnesota,
in the Richmond,</i>

625
00:43:48,538 --> 00:43:50,130
<i>in Woodmere, New York,</i>

626
00:43:51,541 --> 00:43:56,069
<i>who are hearing
her on television,</i>

627
00:43:56,146 --> 00:44:00,048
<i>hearing Anita Bryant
on television,</i>

628
00:44:00,117 --> 00:44:04,417
<i>telling them they are
sick, they are wrong,</i>

629
00:44:05,055 --> 00:44:09,617
<i>there is no place in this
great country for them,</i>

630
00:44:09,693 --> 00:44:12,253
<i>no place in this world,</i>

631
00:44:12,329 --> 00:44:15,821
<i>they are looking to us
for something tonight.</i>

632
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:19,291
<i>And I say</i>

633
00:44:19,369 --> 00:44:22,634
<i>we have got to
give them hope!</i>

634
00:44:25,709 --> 00:44:26,733
<i>Hope!</i>

635
00:44:26,977 --> 00:44:30,674
...for a better world.
Hope for a better tomorrow.

636
00:44:31,481 --> 00:44:34,780
Hope for a better place to come into
if the pressures at home are too great.

637
00:44:34,851 --> 00:44:38,685
Hope for the worker who
awakens from the American dream

638
00:44:38,755 --> 00:44:41,588
only to find that all the
jobs have left the country.

639
00:44:41,658 --> 00:44:43,649
We've got to
give them hope.

640
00:44:56,506 --> 00:44:59,998
When San Francisco
changed its voting rules,

641
00:45:00,077 --> 00:45:03,046
so that people could elect people
from their own neighborhood,

642
00:45:03,113 --> 00:45:07,209
so that the blacks could elect
a African-American supervisor,

643
00:45:07,284 --> 00:45:10,310
and in Chinatown, they could
elect a Chinese supervisor,

644
00:45:10,387 --> 00:45:14,448
and in the Castro, they could choose
between myself and Rick Stokes.

645
00:45:15,025 --> 00:45:16,925
<i>But decent art
begs balance, right?</i>

646
00:45:16,993 --> 00:45:20,394
<i>So, little district eight,
two miles south of the Castro,</i>

647
00:45:20,464 --> 00:45:24,560
<i>still very much the same.
Irish Catholic, conservative.</i>

648
00:45:24,634 --> 00:45:26,898
<i>And with just the
right amount of poetry,</i>

649
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:29,768
<i>they found themselves
a handsome ex-cop.</i>

650
00:45:30,173 --> 00:45:32,733
See, I'm not going to be
forced out of San Francisco

651
00:45:32,809 --> 00:45:37,940
by splinter groups of social radicals,
social deviants, and incorrigibles.

652
00:45:38,014 --> 00:45:41,916
Now you must realize that there are
thousands upon thousands of frustrated,

653
00:45:41,985 --> 00:45:44,647
angry people,
such as yourselves,

654
00:45:44,721 --> 00:45:47,918
just waiting to unleash
a fury that will eradicate

655
00:45:47,991 --> 00:45:50,926
the malignancies that
blight our beautiful city.

656
00:45:54,264 --> 00:45:57,700
Just one more. We can't let
Rick Stokes take this one.

657
00:45:57,768 --> 00:45:59,599
Let Rick Stokes
take it.

658
00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:08,407
Sorry.

659
00:46:11,348 --> 00:46:13,282
I can't do another one.

660
00:46:57,561 --> 00:47:01,292
Oh, God damn it.

661
00:47:23,253 --> 00:47:25,221
Bring out the old,
bring in the new.

662
00:47:25,288 --> 00:47:27,552
This is over. Done.

663
00:47:27,624 --> 00:47:30,559
I don't want to see one more thing
that says fucking Assembly on it.

664
00:47:30,627 --> 00:47:35,690
'Cause this three time faggot
loser is running for supervisor.

665
00:47:35,765 --> 00:47:37,824
There she is.
Who the heck is that?

666
00:47:37,901 --> 00:47:39,926
That's our
new campaign manager.

667
00:47:40,003 --> 00:47:43,063
She called last week to volunteer
and I asked for her help.

668
00:47:43,139 --> 00:47:45,869
Help or take over?
What about Scott?

669
00:47:45,942 --> 00:47:47,432
We need new blood.

670
00:47:47,510 --> 00:47:51,310
Gentlemen, Anne Kronenberg.
A woman.

671
00:47:51,381 --> 00:47:54,908
A woman who likes women.
And that's odd, isn't it?

672
00:47:54,985 --> 00:47:56,543
Hi, guys.

673
00:47:56,620 --> 00:48:00,283
Mr. Milk, Rick Stokes isn't pulling out.

674
00:48:00,357 --> 00:48:02,791
He's officially filed
to run against you.

675
00:48:02,859 --> 00:48:06,158
<i>My friend at The Advocate says
David Goodstein is backing him.</i>

676
00:48:06,229 --> 00:48:08,459
So, a gay candidate
against a gay candidate.

677
00:48:08,531 --> 00:48:09,964
That's unfortunate.

678
00:48:10,033 --> 00:48:11,295
Let's find out when they
are going to announce.

679
00:48:11,368 --> 00:48:13,199
So you replaced
Scott with a lesbian?

680
00:48:13,270 --> 00:48:15,568
Anne worked on a recycling
campaign up north.

681
00:48:15,639 --> 00:48:18,233
She's very, very organized.
We need that.

682
00:48:18,308 --> 00:48:20,333
How do you know she's
not a plant for Rick Stokes?

683
00:48:20,410 --> 00:48:22,640
Are you guys
always this paranoid?

684
00:48:22,712 --> 00:48:25,306
Yes. We take after Harvey.

685
00:48:25,382 --> 00:48:27,316
Don't you have someone's
laundry to do?

686
00:48:27,384 --> 00:48:29,249
Shouldn't you be at
a hairdressing convention?

687
00:48:30,687 --> 00:48:33,155
Sir, my girlfriends say
you guys don't like women.

688
00:48:33,223 --> 00:48:34,485
I'm just asking.

689
00:48:34,557 --> 00:48:38,288
Is there a place for us in all
this or are you all scared of girls?

690
00:48:41,264 --> 00:48:42,788
Okay, gentlemen,

691
00:48:42,866 --> 00:48:45,198
we've already got a tinker
bell, a lotus blossom.

692
00:48:45,268 --> 00:48:46,895
We've got Jim and Dick
in their three-piece suits.

693
00:48:46,970 --> 00:48:51,168
We need someone to manage
things. A woman this time.

694
00:48:52,409 --> 00:48:54,070
Plus,
she's the right price,

695
00:48:54,144 --> 00:48:56,612
and she's got bigger balls
than anybody else in here.

696
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:59,012
Just give me whatever is in the
register at the end of the day.

697
00:48:59,082 --> 00:49:04,816
<i>So should I call The Chronicle about
getting us an actual endorsement this time?</i>

698
00:49:04,888 --> 00:49:06,014
No?

699
00:49:06,089 --> 00:49:08,990
<i>Yeah, call The Chronicle,
sweetheart. Tell them I said hi.</i>

700
00:49:09,059 --> 00:49:11,892
Please call. In fact,
don't drive down there.

701
00:49:11,962 --> 00:49:13,759
You'll scare
the shit out of them.

702
00:49:15,532 --> 00:49:17,056
Call.

703
00:49:17,133 --> 00:49:18,225
All right.

704
00:49:18,301 --> 00:49:19,700
Hi, I'm Cleve.

705
00:49:19,769 --> 00:49:21,464
Anne. Good to meet you.

706
00:49:21,538 --> 00:49:24,302
I was telling Harvey we needed
some tough dykes around here, so...

707
00:49:24,374 --> 00:49:25,773
Well, you got one.

708
00:50:15,792 --> 00:50:16,884
All right.

709
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:19,952
First ever newspaper
endorsement.

710
00:50:20,030 --> 00:50:22,726
<i>And we got
the Bay Guardian,</i>

711
00:50:22,799 --> 00:50:25,529
<i>The Sentinel and
The Bay Area Reporter.</i>

712
00:50:28,972 --> 00:50:33,375
You are pulling your weight.
Oh, this is sensational!

713
00:50:34,778 --> 00:50:37,440
They endorsed you for
being a good businessman?

714
00:50:37,514 --> 00:50:40,415
Oh, my gosh, you really
are a miracle worker.

715
00:50:40,483 --> 00:50:42,815
Scott has got to read this.
He's just gonna piss himself.

716
00:50:42,886 --> 00:50:44,615
Yeah,
you should show him.

717
00:50:45,555 --> 00:50:46,817
You know what you should do, Cleve,

718
00:50:46,890 --> 00:50:50,189
you should get yourself a boy to
celebrate with, just in case we win.

719
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:51,659
Anybody want to
buy me a drink?

720
00:50:51,728 --> 00:50:53,559
Oh, I will buy you
a drink.

721
00:50:53,630 --> 00:50:55,097
How about a bottle
of champagne?

722
00:50:56,399 --> 00:50:59,630
We are going to The Stud
right fucking now.

723
00:50:59,702 --> 00:51:01,670
Harvey, are you going to
come? You're gonna miss out?

724
00:51:01,738 --> 00:51:04,468
Go, go, go, go. I want
to be with my newspaper.

725
00:51:07,310 --> 00:51:08,971
Come on, let's go.
Come on, I'm buying.

726
00:51:09,045 --> 00:51:11,570
You're not buying.
You don't have any money.

727
00:51:20,123 --> 00:51:21,852
Gonna win this time, Milk?

728
00:52:01,097 --> 00:52:03,361
You look more
handsome in the poster.

729
00:52:04,667 --> 00:52:05,793
Oh, thank you.

730
00:52:08,571 --> 00:52:12,302
You know, palominos
are my favorite horse.

731
00:52:12,809 --> 00:52:14,504
They're smart.

732
00:52:15,111 --> 00:52:17,443
But they're
compact and fast.

733
00:52:17,514 --> 00:52:19,448
I like that.

734
00:52:22,886 --> 00:52:26,788
You think I'm more
like a palomino,

735
00:52:28,391 --> 00:52:30,518
or a stallion?

736
00:52:31,294 --> 00:52:33,785
You know,
with big balls and...

737
00:52:33,863 --> 00:52:37,026
Oh, oh, oh, oh!
Here, let me help you.

738
00:52:39,469 --> 00:52:41,198
You okay?

739
00:52:41,271 --> 00:52:43,296
Yeah, it's...
Come in.

740
00:52:43,373 --> 00:52:46,137
Here, just lean on me.

741
00:52:46,209 --> 00:52:47,642
Thank you.
What happened?

742
00:52:47,710 --> 00:52:49,974
I don't know, these
boots are too big for me.

743
00:52:50,046 --> 00:52:54,039
Oh, well, let's get you in
and get those off your feet.

744
00:52:54,117 --> 00:52:56,415
Where you going?

745
00:52:56,486 --> 00:52:58,579
I have
some things to do.

746
00:52:58,655 --> 00:53:01,283
I got to go and meet
some friends. No, no, no.

747
00:53:12,101 --> 00:53:14,569
My father beat
me when he found out.

748
00:53:14,871 --> 00:53:17,271
So, that's
why I came here.

749
00:53:18,575 --> 00:53:24,844
But, I'm living with this
guy that... I don't know.

750
00:53:25,515 --> 00:53:27,380
I don't like him.

751
00:53:30,353 --> 00:53:32,548
Nobody will
ever beat you again.

752
00:53:37,427 --> 00:53:40,658
I love you.
I love you.

753
00:53:41,931 --> 00:53:43,899
Do you even
remember my name?

754
00:53:49,105 --> 00:53:50,732
No.

755
00:53:50,807 --> 00:53:52,001
Harvey.

756
00:53:53,376 --> 00:53:54,638
I'm Harvey.

757
00:53:55,945 --> 00:53:58,709
Harvey, I love you.

758
00:54:09,926 --> 00:54:11,018
Thanks.

759
00:54:11,094 --> 00:54:12,186
Thank you.

760
00:54:23,172 --> 00:54:25,902
<i>For the first
time, it all came together.</i>

761
00:54:25,975 --> 00:54:31,811
<i>The union boys, women, the
seniors, the gays and minorities.</i>

762
00:54:31,881 --> 00:54:34,179
<i>All of the "us's"
showed up.</i>

763
00:54:34,250 --> 00:54:36,184
<i>We can hear it,
we can't really see too much,</i>

764
00:54:36,252 --> 00:54:38,686
<i>but it looks and sounds
to you and to me</i>

765
00:54:38,755 --> 00:54:41,087
<i>like New Year's Eve
on Market Street.</i>

766
00:54:45,428 --> 00:54:47,658
We did it!

767
00:54:47,730 --> 00:54:49,664
I love you all!

768
00:55:05,481 --> 00:55:09,781
We are the movement. We are
the movement. Thank you so much.

769
00:55:10,386 --> 00:55:11,785
Come on, we just want
to congratulate him.

770
00:55:11,854 --> 00:55:14,414
No, I understand, but
right now we're all full.

771
00:55:18,127 --> 00:55:20,027
Harvey!

772
00:55:20,096 --> 00:55:21,222
Harvey!
Harvey!

773
00:55:21,297 --> 00:55:23,527
Hey, Harvey!

774
00:55:25,068 --> 00:55:26,160
Hey.

775
00:55:26,235 --> 00:55:29,636
Sorry, it's just so crowded.

776
00:55:29,706 --> 00:55:31,970
Come in, sorry, sorry.

777
00:55:32,041 --> 00:55:34,737
It's so crowded.
It's just so crowded.

778
00:55:35,578 --> 00:55:37,170
Harvey, man!

779
00:55:42,452 --> 00:55:43,544
Scotty!

780
00:55:45,188 --> 00:55:47,986
Is this all for you, Harvey?
Are you this famous, baby?

781
00:55:48,057 --> 00:55:50,025
No, we do this all the time.
You like it?

782
00:55:50,093 --> 00:55:51,151
Yeah.

783
00:55:51,227 --> 00:55:54,993
The new Mrs. Milk.
I give it a week.

784
00:55:55,064 --> 00:55:59,296
Gordon Lau, Carol Ruth Silver. It's the
most liberal board in years. In history!

785
00:55:59,969 --> 00:56:01,800
What about Dan White?
Did he win?

786
00:56:01,871 --> 00:56:04,169
We'll deal with him tomorrow. Oh, God.

787
00:56:16,452 --> 00:56:19,250
<i>Does this mean,
as many straights are concerned,</i>

788
00:56:19,322 --> 00:56:22,155
<i>maybe the gays are taking
over San Francisco?</i>

789
00:56:22,225 --> 00:56:25,422
<i>Are you going to be a
supervisor for all the people?</i>

790
00:56:25,495 --> 00:56:27,895
<i>Well, I have to be. That's
what I was elected for.</i>

791
00:56:27,964 --> 00:56:30,558
<i>I have to be there to
open for the dialogue,</i>

792
00:56:30,633 --> 00:56:33,602
<i>for the sensitivities of all
people and all their problems.</i>

793
00:56:33,669 --> 00:56:36,502
<i>The problems that affect
this city, affect us all.</i>

794
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:38,630
<i>Okay, well,
congratulations.</i>

795
00:56:38,708 --> 00:56:41,199
<i>Thank you.
Thank you, San Francisco!</i>

796
00:56:43,146 --> 00:56:44,477
<i>And that's Harvey Milk,</i>

797
00:56:44,547 --> 00:56:47,482
<i>celebrating his election to the
San Francisco Board of Supervisors.</i>

798
00:56:47,550 --> 00:56:49,848
<i>For Channel Five news,
I'm Mary Dilts.</i>

799
00:56:52,288 --> 00:56:56,589
<i>I, Harvey Milk,
do solemnly swear...</i>

800
00:56:56,659 --> 00:57:03,457
<i>That I will support and defend
the Constitution of the United States...</i>

801
00:57:03,533 --> 00:57:07,230
<i>During such time as I
hold the office of supervisor,</i>

802
00:57:07,303 --> 00:57:10,170
<i>City and County
of San Francisco.</i>

803
00:57:10,239 --> 00:57:13,902
During such time as I hold
the office of supervisor,

804
00:57:13,976 --> 00:57:16,570
City and County
of San Francisco.

805
00:57:16,646 --> 00:57:18,807
Congratulations, Harvey.
Thank you, Mayor.

806
00:57:22,018 --> 00:57:26,853
<i>Anita Bryant said that it was gay people
that brought the drought to California.</i>

807
00:57:27,557 --> 00:57:31,516
<i>Well, it looks to me as though
it's finally started raining.</i>

808
00:57:32,795 --> 00:57:34,422
<i>This will be
the first time in many years</i>

809
00:57:34,497 --> 00:57:37,466
<i>that we've seen so many new
faces on the Board of Supervisors.</i>

810
00:57:37,533 --> 00:57:40,525
Do you think such diversity
will cripple the board?

811
00:57:40,603 --> 00:57:43,902
Well, the name of the game is
six votes to get anything passed.

812
00:57:43,973 --> 00:57:45,463
So, whether you like it or not,

813
00:57:45,541 --> 00:57:47,702
Dan and I are
in bed together.

814
00:57:47,777 --> 00:57:49,267
Politically speaking.

815
00:57:49,679 --> 00:57:51,840
<i>You see, I've assured
Harvey here that, uh,</i>

816
00:57:51,914 --> 00:57:54,439
<i>my brochure's comments
about social deviants</i>

817
00:57:54,517 --> 00:57:57,452
<i>referred more to junkies
than to his people.</i>

818
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:59,647
<i>See, I'm about to
have my first child</i>

819
00:57:59,722 --> 00:58:03,488
<i>and I had to make sure that this city
remains a decent place to raise him.</i>

820
00:58:04,627 --> 00:58:07,425
<i>Well, thank you so much
for coming on the show, gentlemen,</i>

821
00:58:07,497 --> 00:58:09,124
<i>and we'll see what happens.</i>

822
00:58:09,198 --> 00:58:10,426
<i>HARVEY/ That's it?
It's over? We're finished?</i>

823
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:11,558
<i>Yes.</i>

824
00:58:11,634 --> 00:58:13,568
<i>That was quick.
Thank you.</i>

825
00:58:14,136 --> 00:58:15,831
How long were
you a fireman, Dan?

826
00:58:15,905 --> 00:58:17,304
A couple of years.

827
00:58:17,373 --> 00:58:19,398
And you were a police
officer before that?

828
00:58:19,475 --> 00:58:21,238
You got something
against cops, Harv?

829
00:58:21,310 --> 00:58:23,540
No, no. They tend
to against me though.

830
00:58:23,613 --> 00:58:26,047
But firefighters,
they're the true heroes.

831
00:58:26,115 --> 00:58:28,879
They supported me on my last
campaign. I fully support them.

832
00:58:28,951 --> 00:58:30,612
I appreciate that.

833
00:58:30,686 --> 00:58:32,654
I meant what I said.
I'd like to work together.

834
00:58:32,722 --> 00:58:34,349
Me, too.
I'll see you later.

835
00:58:34,423 --> 00:58:35,412
Okay.

836
00:58:48,938 --> 00:58:52,032
Oh. What do you think of my new theater?

837
00:58:52,108 --> 00:58:53,575
A bit over the top.

838
00:58:55,778 --> 00:58:57,575
You're
wearing a suit?

839
00:58:57,647 --> 00:58:58,978
I got it
from a friend.

840
00:58:59,048 --> 00:59:00,242
No, no, no, no.

841
00:59:00,316 --> 00:59:03,945
Anytime you come here, I want you
to wear the tightest jeans possible.

842
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:07,046
Never blend in. And
never take the elevator.

843
00:59:07,123 --> 00:59:08,385
Always use
the stairs.

844
00:59:08,457 --> 00:59:13,451
You can make such a grand
entrance by taking these stairs.

845
00:59:13,829 --> 00:59:15,023
Hello.

846
00:59:15,565 --> 00:59:17,089
Carol, friend.

847
00:59:18,534 --> 00:59:19,967
Dan White.

848
00:59:22,071 --> 00:59:23,299
Hello, Dianne.

849
00:59:25,374 --> 00:59:27,604
And then this is
Gordon Lau's office.

850
00:59:27,677 --> 00:59:29,235
Anne, can you set Cleve up on mail?

851
00:59:29,312 --> 00:59:30,472
Will do.

852
00:59:32,148 --> 00:59:33,547
Okay,

853
00:59:33,616 --> 00:59:35,811
first order of business
to come out of this office

854
00:59:35,885 --> 00:59:37,580
is a citywide
Gay Rights Ordinance,

855
00:59:37,653 --> 00:59:40,383
just like the one that Anita
shot down in Dade County.

856
00:59:40,456 --> 00:59:41,616
What do you think,
Lotus Blossom?

857
00:59:41,691 --> 00:59:43,818
I think it's good.
It's not great.

858
00:59:43,893 --> 00:59:47,886
Okay, so make it brilliant. We want
Anita's attention here in San Francisco.

859
00:59:47,964 --> 00:59:50,057
I want her to bring her fight to us.

860
00:59:50,132 --> 00:59:53,158
We need a unanimous
vote, we need headlines.

861
00:59:53,235 --> 00:59:54,862
Dan White is not
gonna vote for this.

862
00:59:54,937 --> 00:59:56,165
Dan White will be fine.

863
00:59:56,238 --> 00:59:58,502
Dan White is just
uneducated. We'll teach him.

864
00:59:58,574 --> 01:00:01,134
Hey, Harv,
committee meets at 9:30.

865
01:00:01,544 --> 01:00:02,670
Hey, you guys.

866
01:00:02,745 --> 01:00:05,509
Say, did you get the invitation
to my son's christening?

867
01:00:05,581 --> 01:00:07,378
I invited a few of
the other Supes, too.

868
01:00:07,450 --> 01:00:09,213
Oh, I'll be there.

869
01:00:09,285 --> 01:00:11,082
Great! Thanks.

870
01:00:12,021 --> 01:00:13,989
Did he hear you?
What the fuck!

871
01:00:14,056 --> 01:00:15,921
Are you going?

872
01:00:15,992 --> 01:00:19,189
I would let him christen me if it means
he's gonna vote for the Gay Rights Ordinance.

873
01:00:19,261 --> 01:00:21,889
We need allies.
We need everyone.

874
01:00:22,598 --> 01:00:24,088
I don't think
he heard you.

875
01:00:24,166 --> 01:00:25,895
Is it just me
or is he cute?

876
01:00:48,491 --> 01:00:49,651
Jack?

877
01:00:50,092 --> 01:00:53,994
Welcome home, Harvey.
I hope you're hungry.

878
01:00:54,430 --> 01:00:57,456
I just know how to cook one
thing, but I make it good.

879
01:00:58,701 --> 01:01:00,066
Come.

880
01:01:00,136 --> 01:01:01,967
Jack,
did you break in?

881
01:01:02,038 --> 01:01:05,474
No, no, no. I asked the little
boy downstairs to let me in.

882
01:01:05,541 --> 01:01:06,735
Danny?
Yeah.

883
01:01:06,809 --> 01:01:09,539
He wouldn't let me,
so I came in this way.

884
01:01:10,813 --> 01:01:13,407
You know, your friends aren't
very nice to me, Harvey.

885
01:01:13,482 --> 01:01:15,143
I have a Town Hall
meeting tonight.

886
01:01:15,217 --> 01:01:19,153
Sit down. Come, five minutes.
That's it. Come, please.

887
01:01:20,589 --> 01:01:22,216
There you go.

888
01:01:23,192 --> 01:01:26,025
I watched TV here
today, all day.

889
01:01:26,095 --> 01:01:27,926
<i>I saw All My Children.</i>

890
01:01:29,498 --> 01:01:32,661
And they killed Margo. But I
knew it was going to happen.

891
01:01:34,303 --> 01:01:37,534
You know, they always try and
trick you but it never works.

892
01:01:38,708 --> 01:01:40,505
You always
see it coming.

893
01:01:40,576 --> 01:01:45,707
What? Killing the blonde?
Yeah, I'm good with that.

894
01:01:50,586 --> 01:01:52,144
Jack.
What?

895
01:01:52,421 --> 01:01:54,150
If I make you a key,

896
01:01:55,424 --> 01:01:57,654
will you promise never
to break in again?

897
01:01:59,328 --> 01:02:00,795
That's right.

898
01:02:11,741 --> 01:02:15,768
Is it your will that Charles should
be baptized in the faith of the church

899
01:02:15,845 --> 01:02:17,710
which we have all
professed with you?

900
01:02:17,780 --> 01:02:19,304
It is.
It is.

901
01:02:23,185 --> 01:02:26,416
Charles, I baptize you
in the name of the Father

902
01:02:26,489 --> 01:02:29,856
and of the Son and
of the Holy Spirit.

903
01:02:36,465 --> 01:02:39,628
God, the father of our Lord Jesus
Christ has freed you from sin...

904
01:02:39,702 --> 01:02:41,966
I'm proposing
a citywide ordinance

905
01:02:42,037 --> 01:02:44,835
which would ensure that any
person who already has a job

906
01:02:44,907 --> 01:02:47,740
cannot be fired on the
basis of sexual orientation.

907
01:02:48,711 --> 01:02:51,703
I don't think my constituents
would favor that, Harvey.

908
01:02:54,483 --> 01:02:57,179
Is there anyone else here
from the board today, Dan?

909
01:02:58,087 --> 01:03:00,351
You're the only one
who showed, I think.

910
01:03:00,422 --> 01:03:01,548
Were you
christened here?

911
01:03:01,624 --> 01:03:04,149
I was. Right here, same parish.

912
01:03:04,226 --> 01:03:07,252
My grandma immigrated here when
this was an Irish Catholic city,

913
01:03:07,329 --> 01:03:09,024
the City of Saint Francis.

914
01:03:09,799 --> 01:03:11,391
But a lot's changed here
since then, you know.

915
01:03:11,467 --> 01:03:13,992
You're more like one
of us now, an outsider.

916
01:03:14,603 --> 01:03:17,470
You're not like most
homosexuals, are you, Harvey?

917
01:03:18,374 --> 01:03:20,842
Do you know a lot
of homosexuals, Dan?

918
01:03:23,546 --> 01:03:27,505
Hey, where do you stand
on the Psychiatric Center

919
01:03:27,583 --> 01:03:29,915
that the city's been
pushing into my district?

920
01:03:30,486 --> 01:03:32,545
Well, I'd have
to study it...

921
01:03:32,621 --> 01:03:36,990
It was a key piece on my platform.
Getting it out of my district.

922
01:03:37,059 --> 01:03:39,323
It only attracts arsonists, rapists,
that sort of thing, you know.

923
01:03:39,395 --> 01:03:40,692
A campaign promise.

924
01:03:40,763 --> 01:03:42,492
A big one.
Sure.

925
01:03:44,567 --> 01:03:48,628
What do you say we watch out for each
other's interests? I would really like that.

926
01:03:48,704 --> 01:03:50,831
I'd like that too, Dan.
Good.

927
01:03:51,473 --> 01:03:53,805
Sorry, hon, we just
slipped into some shop talk.

928
01:03:53,876 --> 01:03:56,003
The Gay Rights Ordinance.
My fault.

929
01:03:56,412 --> 01:03:58,676
Seems like an inappropriate
subject, don't you think?

930
01:03:58,747 --> 01:04:01,147
Oh, don't knock it
till you've tried it.

931
01:04:02,585 --> 01:04:06,681
Hello. Oh, oh, but you had
such a beautiful christening.

932
01:04:06,755 --> 01:04:08,814
Supervisors Silver and
Lau are asking you to vote

933
01:04:08,891 --> 01:04:10,882
to keep this Psychiatric
Center in Dan's district.

934
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:13,793
It'll go down six to five
if you vote to get rid of it.

935
01:04:13,863 --> 01:04:15,296
It's a youth
campus, Harvey.

936
01:04:15,364 --> 01:04:17,594
And these are kids that would
be displaced from families.

937
01:04:17,666 --> 01:04:19,827
I can't just dump Dan. He's
got nothing going for him.

938
01:04:19,902 --> 01:04:21,028
No friends...

939
01:04:21,103 --> 01:04:24,504
Oh, God, oh, God! Here we go,
here we go. Harvey to the rescue.

940
01:04:24,573 --> 01:04:26,871
Isn't it enough that we
have to put up with Jack?

941
01:04:26,942 --> 01:04:29,877
All right, lay off. He
registered 120 voters last week.

942
01:04:29,945 --> 01:04:31,378
Okay, so do any
of your volunteers,

943
01:04:31,447 --> 01:04:33,642
but you don't go and
make them all first lady.

944
01:04:33,716 --> 01:04:36,412
Harvey, what does
Dan White do for you?

945
01:04:36,485 --> 01:04:38,510
Really, politically.

946
01:04:39,521 --> 01:04:42,285
He intrigues me.
I think he may be one of us.

947
01:04:42,358 --> 01:04:43,518
No, no.

948
01:04:43,592 --> 01:04:45,253
It's just a theory.

949
01:04:45,327 --> 01:04:46,794
You just
think he's cute.

950
01:04:46,862 --> 01:04:50,093
No, no. I know what it's
like to live that life.

951
01:04:50,165 --> 01:04:53,896
That lie. I can see it in Dan's
eyes. That fear, the pressure.

952
01:05:00,509 --> 01:05:02,477
Good or bad?
Not great.

953
01:05:03,012 --> 01:05:07,346
State Senator John Briggs is Anita
Bryant's go-to guy in California for sure.

954
01:05:07,883 --> 01:05:10,909
He filed a petition for
a statewide referendum

955
01:05:10,986 --> 01:05:14,012
to fire all gay teachers
and anyone who supports them.

956
01:05:14,790 --> 01:05:16,883
How many signatures does he
need to get on the ballot?

957
01:05:16,959 --> 01:05:21,453
Oh, whatever. He can get them in two
Sundays at church in Orange fucking County.

958
01:05:24,433 --> 01:05:27,891
So, this means that
the fight is coming here,

959
01:05:29,171 --> 01:05:31,503
where we can do
something about it.

960
01:05:32,174 --> 01:05:34,369
<i>The issue in
California is whether school boards</i>

961
01:05:34,443 --> 01:05:37,742
<i>should be allowed to fire
teachers who are known homosexuals.</i>

962
01:05:37,813 --> 01:05:39,747
<i>The courts have
ruled they cannot.</i>

963
01:05:39,815 --> 01:05:43,808
<i>Boards must prove a teacher's
homosexuality adversely affects children</i>

964
01:05:43,886 --> 01:05:46,184
<i>and makes them unfit
for the classroom.</i>

965
01:05:46,255 --> 01:05:48,746
<i>State Senator John Briggs
wants to change that.</i>

966
01:05:48,824 --> 01:05:54,319
My proposition promises to protect our
children from these gay perverts and...

967
01:05:55,998 --> 01:05:59,798
These gay perverts and pedophiles
who recruit our children

968
01:05:59,868 --> 01:06:03,167
to participate in their
deviant lifestyle,

969
01:06:03,238 --> 01:06:06,264
including the ones who do
it in our public schools.

970
01:06:06,342 --> 01:06:10,506
The time has come
for us to root them out.

971
01:06:11,714 --> 01:06:13,944
How are you going to
determine who's homosexual?

972
01:06:14,016 --> 01:06:15,313
I'm sorry, sir, what?

973
01:06:15,384 --> 01:06:17,545
How are you going to
determine who's homosexual?

974
01:06:17,619 --> 01:06:20,645
Sir, my bill has procedures
for identifying homosexuals.

975
01:06:20,723 --> 01:06:23,521
Oh, yeah, how? Will you be
sucking them off, Briggs?

976
01:06:23,592 --> 01:06:26,891
Excuse me. You know what,
you can argue with me,

977
01:06:27,663 --> 01:06:29,654
you cannot
argue with God.

978
01:06:35,604 --> 01:06:37,196
Harvey, I can't believe it.

979
01:06:37,272 --> 01:06:40,571
No, he wants my job. You
want my job, you prick!

980
01:06:40,642 --> 01:06:43,770
<i>Sir, you were here when
State Senator Briggs was on the steps.</i>

981
01:06:43,846 --> 01:06:45,245
<i>What do you
think about that?</i>

982
01:06:45,314 --> 01:06:49,410
<i>Well, I think what you saw, you saw some
very committed opposition to his proposition.</i>

983
01:06:49,485 --> 01:06:51,715
<i>And I think that's
only going to continue.</i>

984
01:06:51,787 --> 01:06:54,415
<i>People have very emotional
reactions to this.</i>

985
01:06:54,490 --> 01:06:56,048
<i>This is their lives
that are on the line.</i>

986
01:06:56,125 --> 01:06:58,184
<i>What's going to happen?</i>

987
01:06:58,260 --> 01:07:00,956
<i>Well, look what
happened in Germany.</i>

988
01:07:01,030 --> 01:07:04,659
<i>I mean, Anita Bryant has already said that
the Jews and Muslims are going to hell.</i>

989
01:07:04,733 --> 01:07:07,167
<i>So, you know she
has a shopping list.</i>

990
01:07:07,236 --> 01:07:10,262
<i>And we are not going to let the
John Briggs' or the Anita Bryants</i>

991
01:07:10,339 --> 01:07:12,307
<i>legislate bigotry
in this state.</i>

992
01:07:16,945 --> 01:07:19,175
Hello, Harvey,
running late?

993
01:07:19,248 --> 01:07:21,614
Your boyfriend
is in the closet.

994
01:07:21,683 --> 01:07:23,014
Excuse me, David.

995
01:07:23,085 --> 01:07:26,418
The Latino has locked himself
in the closet upstairs.

996
01:07:26,488 --> 01:07:28,251
Harvey, Harvey,
Phil Burton is here.

997
01:07:28,323 --> 01:07:30,382
He's likely the next
Speaker of the House

998
01:07:30,459 --> 01:07:33,826
and a very important ally
against Proposition 6.

999
01:07:33,896 --> 01:07:35,887
So, please,
no scenes, all right?

1000
01:07:39,268 --> 01:07:41,259
You're right. I was late by 20 minutes.

1001
01:07:41,336 --> 01:07:42,394
So come on out, Jack.

1002
01:07:42,471 --> 01:07:46,305
Who were you with? Scott? Or with
a new boy you were trying to save?

1003
01:07:46,375 --> 01:07:49,173
I was at work. Come on out, sweet pea.

1004
01:07:49,244 --> 01:07:50,905
You embarrassed me,
Harvey.

1005
01:07:50,979 --> 01:07:53,880
I didn't know anyone down
there and they're bad people.

1006
01:07:55,517 --> 01:07:57,747
I just want to go, okay?

1007
01:07:57,820 --> 01:07:59,515
Then you should go home.

1008
01:08:00,722 --> 01:08:03,714
No, I want to stay.
I want to stay here.

1009
01:08:04,293 --> 01:08:07,160
So, you go away, okay?
Go away!

1010
01:08:12,034 --> 01:08:15,094
The Briggs initiative is polling
at 75% for approval statewide.

1011
01:08:15,170 --> 01:08:18,503
80% in other polls. Some even
have us losing San Francisco.

1012
01:08:18,574 --> 01:08:21,099
We deceive people into
thinking we can beat this,

1013
01:08:21,176 --> 01:08:23,474
we'll have riots and only
increase the backlash.

1014
01:08:23,545 --> 01:08:24,978
That's a good point, David.

1015
01:08:25,047 --> 01:08:28,414
Maybe we should just roll over and make
it easier for Briggs to fuck us in the ass.

1016
01:08:28,484 --> 01:08:30,714
We're taking this very
seriously in my office.

1017
01:08:30,786 --> 01:08:33,846
We want to send one of these to every
home in California and that takes money.

1018
01:08:33,922 --> 01:08:36,390
"Proposition 6 is
an affront to human rights.

1019
01:08:36,458 --> 01:08:40,656
"An invasion of the state into the
private lives of California citizens. ' '

1020
01:08:41,063 --> 01:08:43,896
Without a single mention of the
word gay on the entire flyer.

1021
01:08:43,966 --> 01:08:45,490
By design, Harvey.

1022
01:08:45,567 --> 01:08:47,467
Corey Wares is an out
gay teacher... Rick...

1023
01:08:47,536 --> 01:08:50,300
With the heat bearing down
on your movement right now,

1024
01:08:50,372 --> 01:08:53,535
we feel it's best to dodge the gay
bullet. Go for the human rights angle.

1025
01:08:53,609 --> 01:08:57,340
People need to know who it
is that's being affected.

1026
01:08:57,412 --> 01:09:00,006
You need at least one
old queer on this flyer.

1027
01:09:00,082 --> 01:09:01,982
Excuse me, yeah. Maybe you
should volunteer for that, David.

1028
01:09:02,050 --> 01:09:04,541
This is shit. This is
shit and masturbation.

1029
01:09:04,620 --> 01:09:07,521
It's just a coward's response
to a dangerous threat.

1030
01:09:16,765 --> 01:09:18,699
Come on, Jack.
It's time to go.

1031
01:09:19,101 --> 01:09:21,160
Get everyone
together at your place.

1032
01:09:21,236 --> 01:09:24,069
I want young people, I want
women, I want fresh heads.

1033
01:09:24,139 --> 01:09:27,870
Get organizers and fighters,
not politicians. Come on, Jack.

1034
01:09:27,943 --> 01:09:30,503
What about S-C-O-T-T?

1035
01:09:31,313 --> 01:09:32,439
Yeah.

1036
01:09:32,781 --> 01:09:34,510
Jack, come on.

1037
01:09:35,083 --> 01:09:36,141
We have to
fight the machine.

1038
01:09:36,218 --> 01:09:38,686
They don't want to change,
they want to stay in the past.

1039
01:09:38,754 --> 01:09:40,381
Stop and be
realistic about it.

1040
01:09:40,455 --> 01:09:44,414
Realistic? We're not interested in
staying in the closet, losing Prop 6.

1041
01:09:44,493 --> 01:09:46,927
We're all on the same side,
man, we're on the same side.

1042
01:09:48,330 --> 01:09:51,561
Hey, is anybody gonna pay the
pizza guy or we're just gonna stare?

1043
01:09:51,633 --> 01:09:53,260
How could
we not stare?

1044
01:09:54,803 --> 01:09:56,430
Here, put out your hand.

1045
01:09:58,140 --> 01:10:01,166
You are shameless.
You are shameless.

1046
01:10:01,243 --> 01:10:03,438
I mean, I'm proud of you
but you are hysterical.

1047
01:10:03,512 --> 01:10:04,501
Hey.

1048
01:10:11,019 --> 01:10:13,214
We're going to
convince the 90%

1049
01:10:14,389 --> 01:10:16,687
to give a shit
about us 10%.

1050
01:10:16,758 --> 01:10:19,852
We have to let them
know who we are.

1051
01:10:21,463 --> 01:10:24,227
Everybody has to come out.

1052
01:10:24,299 --> 01:10:27,166
Across the entire state,
no matter where they live.

1053
01:10:27,636 --> 01:10:29,194
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

1054
01:10:29,271 --> 01:10:32,707
If we're going to beat Prop 6,
we tell all of them to come out.

1055
01:10:32,774 --> 01:10:36,870
Every gay lawyer, teacher,
doctor, dog catcher.

1056
01:10:36,945 --> 01:10:38,970
We have to
leave the ghetto.

1057
01:10:39,047 --> 01:10:44,007
We have to let all those people out
there know that they know one of us.

1058
01:10:44,086 --> 01:10:46,316
And if somebody doesn't want
to step out of the closet,

1059
01:10:46,388 --> 01:10:48,356
we open the door for them.

1060
01:10:48,423 --> 01:10:49,583
Jesus.

1061
01:10:49,658 --> 01:10:51,990
The whole state isn't
San Francisco, Harvey.

1062
01:10:52,060 --> 01:10:53,322
Clearly, Scott.

1063
01:10:53,395 --> 01:10:54,987
Harvey, that could
be really, really dangerous.

1064
01:10:55,063 --> 01:10:57,293
I mean, there's such a
thing as a right to privacy.

1065
01:10:57,366 --> 01:10:58,890
Privacy.

1066
01:10:59,968 --> 01:11:01,959
In this movement,
at this time,

1067
01:11:02,037 --> 01:11:06,235
I'm not saying this as a
supervisor, privacy is the enemy.

1068
01:11:07,542 --> 01:11:12,275
And if you want real political
power, if that's what you want,

1069
01:11:12,347 --> 01:11:14,941
try telling the truth
for a change.

1070
01:11:15,017 --> 01:11:16,951
All right? Starting here.

1071
01:11:17,019 --> 01:11:20,079
If there's anyone in
this room, right now,

1072
01:11:21,089 --> 01:11:23,023
who hasn't told
their families,

1073
01:11:23,091 --> 01:11:25,423
their friends,
their employers,

1074
01:11:26,561 --> 01:11:27,994
do it now.

1075
01:11:28,730 --> 01:11:31,062
My folks know already.

1076
01:11:33,001 --> 01:11:35,026
My dad doesn't know yet.

1077
01:11:39,274 --> 01:11:41,401
They vote for us
two to one.

1078
01:11:42,144 --> 01:11:44,510
If they know,
they know one of us.

1079
01:11:55,157 --> 01:11:57,352
As much as I'm sure
you'd all like to watch,

1080
01:11:57,426 --> 01:11:59,724
I don't think
that's such a good idea.

1081
01:12:02,164 --> 01:12:06,533
Cleve, could you show Dick where there's
a phone where he could speak in private?

1082
01:12:07,636 --> 01:12:09,729
There's
one in the bedroom.

1083
01:12:24,686 --> 01:12:29,885
I just found myself clawing over
him, literally running to get him.

1084
01:12:29,958 --> 01:12:31,789
Oh, good night.
Good night.

1085
01:12:31,860 --> 01:12:33,452
<i>Ciao, gang.
Sleep tight.</i>

1086
01:12:33,528 --> 01:12:36,224
I thought
you got out of politics.

1087
01:12:36,298 --> 01:12:39,096
Politics.
Not the movement.

1088
01:12:39,968 --> 01:12:41,435
What the hell
was that in there?

1089
01:12:41,503 --> 01:12:43,061
The movement needs people to be upfront.

1090
01:12:43,138 --> 01:12:44,969
Why were you
fighting me in there?

1091
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:48,999
Those are kids in there. You're
asking them to lose their families.

1092
01:12:50,078 --> 01:12:52,774
If their families don't
love them for who they are,

1093
01:12:52,848 --> 01:12:55,180
who they really are, then
they should lose them.

1094
01:12:55,250 --> 01:12:57,013
That's fucking insane.

1095
01:12:57,085 --> 01:12:59,485
You were the biggest
closet case in New York.

1096
01:12:59,554 --> 01:13:02,079
You asked me and all your
boyfriends to keep our traps shut.

1097
01:13:02,157 --> 01:13:03,715
I mean, you're being the hypocrite.

1098
01:13:03,792 --> 01:13:07,421
My parents are gone. My brother
knew. I'm sure they knew.

1099
01:13:08,230 --> 01:13:12,667
How many times did I have
to listen to calls to Mom,

1100
01:13:12,734 --> 01:13:14,793
where you
denied my existence?

1101
01:13:14,870 --> 01:13:18,033
And you want to be normal like
anybody. More than anybody.

1102
01:13:21,777 --> 01:13:23,972
Who's he?
You live together?

1103
01:13:25,147 --> 01:13:26,705
Someone I'm seeing.

1104
01:13:27,449 --> 01:13:29,644
Keeps me out of
trouble, out of the bars.

1105
01:13:31,319 --> 01:13:32,980
I miss you.

1106
01:13:33,789 --> 01:13:35,222
Harvey,

1107
01:13:36,525 --> 01:13:37,958
what's that about?

1108
01:13:38,026 --> 01:13:39,926
Harvey.

1109
01:13:41,029 --> 01:13:42,587
He needs me.

1110
01:13:52,007 --> 01:13:56,307
If there is an air of dishonesty
with this board and its members,

1111
01:13:56,378 --> 01:13:57,572
that is repugnant...

1112
01:13:57,646 --> 01:14:00,638
I have told no lies today or
to Supervisor White in the past.

1113
01:14:00,715 --> 01:14:02,148
Supervisor Milk,
you will come to order.

1114
01:14:02,217 --> 01:14:04,811
I would like it
noted that I never promised

1115
01:14:04,886 --> 01:14:06,717
to back moving any
mental health centers.

1116
01:14:06,788 --> 01:14:10,849
And that with great respect to Supervisor
White, I would like his remarks stricken.

1117
01:14:10,926 --> 01:14:15,158
Duly noted. We will take a 10 minute
recess before recording the vote.

1118
01:14:16,965 --> 01:14:18,956
Thank you, Harvey.

1119
01:14:20,068 --> 01:14:23,629
Can I have a moment with
Harvey? Alone, please, Carol?

1120
01:14:28,777 --> 01:14:31,644
Why? Why are you
turning on me like this?

1121
01:14:31,713 --> 01:14:33,647
At the last minute?
What did I do?

1122
01:14:33,715 --> 01:14:34,807
I never
got the details.

1123
01:14:34,883 --> 01:14:37,408
Dan, if you want me to help
you draft another version of it

1124
01:14:37,486 --> 01:14:41,923
that doesn't shanghai every troubled
kid in your area, I'll be happy to.

1125
01:14:41,990 --> 01:14:46,757
Harvey, I can't go back to my family,
to my folks, to my district without this.

1126
01:14:46,828 --> 01:14:48,819
Don't do this. Well, I have
a lot of pressure on me.

1127
01:14:48,897 --> 01:14:50,455
So, you're just
stringing me along

1128
01:14:50,532 --> 01:14:51,999
and then you're just gonna throw
me to the wolves, is that it?

1129
01:14:52,067 --> 01:14:53,227
Dan, you only need one more vote.

1130
01:14:53,301 --> 01:14:55,997
You've got five other supervisors
you can convince besides me.

1131
01:14:56,071 --> 01:14:59,063
I'm gonna vote against your queer law
and I'm gonna get Quentin against it, too.

1132
01:14:59,140 --> 01:15:01,768
Oh, it's gonna pass anyway and you
can't keep alienating yourself here, Dan.

1133
01:15:01,843 --> 01:15:05,335
I gave you a chance, Harvey, okay?
I gave you a chance and you blew it!

1134
01:15:07,115 --> 01:15:08,639
You blew it.

1135
01:15:13,788 --> 01:15:16,018
<i>The city council in
St. Paul, Minnesota</i>

1136
01:15:16,091 --> 01:15:18,525
<i>passed a law guaranteeing,
among other things,</i>

1137
01:15:18,593 --> 01:15:21,721
<i>equal rights in housing,
employment and education,</i>

1138
01:15:21,796 --> 01:15:23,991
<i>regardless of
sexual preference.</i>

1139
01:15:24,065 --> 01:15:26,533
<i>Now, voters in that city have
made their disapproval clear.</i>

1140
01:15:26,601 --> 01:15:30,970
<i>Homosexuality is a question facing
the voters of Eugene, Oregon tomorrow.</i>

1141
01:15:31,039 --> 01:15:33,701
<i>A referendum to repeal
gay rights protection.</i>

1142
01:15:34,075 --> 01:15:39,240
So, while we were fighting
Proposition 6 and Briggs in California,

1143
01:15:40,382 --> 01:15:42,543
I needed to put
a show on the road.

1144
01:15:43,285 --> 01:15:46,618
And our next stop,
Wichita, Kansas.

1145
01:15:46,688 --> 01:15:50,351
<i>Voters of Wichita, Kansas
have overwhelmingly repealed</i>

1146
01:15:50,425 --> 01:15:52,586
<i>a city law
protecting homosexuals</i>

1147
01:15:52,661 --> 01:15:55,152
<i>against discrimination
in jobs and housing.</i>

1148
01:15:55,230 --> 01:15:57,494
<i>Only two hours
after the polls closed,</i>

1149
01:15:57,566 --> 01:16:01,900
<i>the church organization that started the
repeal action was celebrating victory.</i>

1150
01:16:06,107 --> 01:16:07,972
Hey, Lawrence, it's Cleve.

1151
01:16:08,043 --> 01:16:09,305
Hey, we're losing Wichita.

1152
01:16:09,377 --> 01:16:12,574
So rally tonight sundown
at Market and Castro, okay?

1153
01:16:12,647 --> 01:16:13,978
Okay, bye.

1154
01:16:16,284 --> 01:16:17,273
Hello?

1155
01:16:28,797 --> 01:16:32,699
Jerry. Hey,
we're losing Wichita...

1156
01:16:42,877 --> 01:16:44,367
They're moving.
I don't know where.

1157
01:16:44,446 --> 01:16:46,846
Did Jim call the press? You
get out there with your camera.

1158
01:16:46,915 --> 01:16:49,884
Press is covered. But we
don't have a permit to march.

1159
01:16:51,252 --> 01:16:52,378
Hurry up.

1160
01:16:59,260 --> 01:17:03,697
When I got Coors beer out of the
bars, the union boys gave me this.

1161
01:17:03,765 --> 01:17:05,756
I want you
to take it now.

1162
01:17:06,468 --> 01:17:08,026
What am I supposed
to do with this?

1163
01:17:08,103 --> 01:17:09,764
You're an activist now,
you're gonna march them.

1164
01:17:09,838 --> 01:17:12,170
I want you to march them right up
to the front doors of City Hall.

1165
01:17:12,240 --> 01:17:14,834
When things start
to look really bad,

1166
01:17:14,909 --> 01:17:19,073
the city's first gay supervisor
will come out and play peacemaker.

1167
01:17:20,849 --> 01:17:22,111
Do it with me.

1168
01:17:31,359 --> 01:17:32,519
<i>Hello.</i>

1169
01:17:33,695 --> 01:17:36,061
<i>Forty years ago, tonight,</i>

1170
01:17:36,131 --> 01:17:41,535
<i>the gay citizens of Germany found
out they no longer had civil rights.</i>

1171
01:17:44,439 --> 01:17:49,069
<i>Tomorrow morning, the gay citizens
of Wichita will also awaken</i>

1172
01:17:49,144 --> 01:17:53,171
<i>to find that they too
have lost their civil rights!</i>

1173
01:17:53,248 --> 01:17:57,685
<i>You have whistles. You use
them when we have been attacked.</i>

1174
01:17:58,153 --> 01:17:59,848
<i>Tonight we have been attacked.</i>

1175
01:17:59,921 --> 01:18:02,116
Come on, the crowd
is leaving without us!

1176
01:18:02,190 --> 01:18:03,680
Shit!

1177
01:18:29,184 --> 01:18:31,516
Get the press
to the marquee.

1178
01:18:31,586 --> 01:18:34,054
<i>Move left! Move left!</i>

1179
01:18:34,122 --> 01:18:36,181
What are you doing? What are
you doing? Where's Harvey?

1180
01:18:36,257 --> 01:18:38,691
We're shutting down traffic,
both directions.

1181
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:39,954
<i>Cameras are rolling.</i>

1182
01:18:40,028 --> 01:18:42,189
Okay, disconnect
the power arm!

1183
01:18:58,513 --> 01:19:05,143
<i>Civil rights or civil
war! Gay rights now!</i>

1184
01:19:16,131 --> 01:19:19,794
Civil rights
or civil war! Gay rights now!

1185
01:19:19,868 --> 01:19:26,998
Civil rights or civil war!
Gay rights now!

1186
01:19:27,075 --> 01:19:28,337
<i>Anita!</i>

1187
01:19:28,409 --> 01:19:32,539
<i>Anita, you're a liar!
We'll set your hair on fire!</i>

1188
01:19:32,614 --> 01:19:34,479
Anita, you're a liar!

1189
01:19:34,549 --> 01:19:41,416
Anita, you're a liar!
We'll set your hair on fire!

1190
01:20:07,849 --> 01:20:10,283
Okay, okay!

1191
01:20:11,686 --> 01:20:14,883
<i>My name is Harvey Milk
and I'm here to recruit you.</i>

1192
01:20:16,991 --> 01:20:20,290
They're calling it
a successful mediation.

1193
01:20:20,361 --> 01:20:24,525
You're a goddamn hero. Fuck,
we came this close to a riot.

1194
01:20:26,668 --> 01:20:28,135
Next time
put down the note cards.

1195
01:20:28,203 --> 01:20:32,162
You got to keep talking into that bullhorn
and tell them what they're feeling.

1196
01:20:32,240 --> 01:20:35,266
Oh, you're just jealous
it wasn't you out there.

1197
01:20:35,343 --> 01:20:37,811
We're losing
Proposition 6 by 60%,

1198
01:20:37,879 --> 01:20:39,847
and you're over there
celebrating a riot.

1199
01:20:39,914 --> 01:20:41,882
What we need is exposure.

1200
01:20:41,950 --> 01:20:43,474
If we're gonna
beat this thing,

1201
01:20:43,551 --> 01:20:45,781
we got to get Briggs
to acknowledge it.

1202
01:20:45,854 --> 01:20:49,290
Every paper's calling
Prop 6 the main event now.

1203
01:20:49,357 --> 01:20:52,918
We lose this, we'll have
anti-gay laws in all 50 states,

1204
01:20:52,994 --> 01:20:55,258
and Briggs won't answer our
calls for a public debate.

1205
01:20:55,330 --> 01:20:56,991
He's trying
to ignore us to death.

1206
01:20:57,065 --> 01:20:59,192
We need
something populist.

1207
01:21:00,935 --> 01:21:03,426
What's the number one
problem in this city?

1208
01:21:03,504 --> 01:21:05,995
The fucking piss
smell in the tenderloin.

1209
01:21:06,074 --> 01:21:07,234
Close.

1210
01:21:07,308 --> 01:21:08,673
Dog shit.

1211
01:21:09,711 --> 01:21:12,271
If you clean up the dog shit in
this town, you're the next mayor.

1212
01:21:12,347 --> 01:21:14,372
<i>Supervisor Milk
took to the grassy lawn</i>

1213
01:21:14,449 --> 01:21:17,077
<i>at Duboce Park this afternoon
to publicize the new law.</i>

1214
01:21:17,151 --> 01:21:20,120
Dog mess is a hazard and on
top of that, it's disgusting.

1215
01:21:20,188 --> 01:21:24,215
So under the new ordinance, all dog
owners who don't clean up their mess

1216
01:21:24,292 --> 01:21:25,384
will be fined.

1217
01:21:25,460 --> 01:21:28,395
<i>Milk put his foot down to
emphasize that the city intends to enforce,</i>

1218
01:21:28,463 --> 01:21:30,226
<i>and you guessed it.</i>

1219
01:21:30,298 --> 01:21:34,098
<i>In Supervisor Milk's words,
"This really is the bottom line. "</i>

1220
01:21:34,269 --> 01:21:35,429
<i>Aye.</i>

1221
01:21:35,503 --> 01:21:38,597
Lau, aye.
Supervisor Hutch?

1222
01:21:38,673 --> 01:21:39,731
Aye.

1223
01:21:39,807 --> 01:21:43,106
Hutch, aye.
Supervisor White?

1224
01:21:44,579 --> 01:21:45,671
No.

1225
01:21:45,747 --> 01:21:49,148
White, no.
Supervisor Silver?

1226
01:21:49,217 --> 01:21:50,548
Aye.

1227
01:21:50,618 --> 01:21:53,781
Silver, aye.
Supervisor Milk?

1228
01:21:54,889 --> 01:21:55,981
Aye.

1229
01:21:56,057 --> 01:21:57,957
Milk, aye.

1230
01:21:58,026 --> 01:22:02,224
Madam President, I have
ten ayes and one no.

1231
01:22:02,297 --> 01:22:05,027
The San Francisco
Gay Rights Ordinance

1232
01:22:05,099 --> 01:22:09,866
sponsored by Supervisors
Milk and Silver is passed.

1233
01:22:17,478 --> 01:22:19,912
I can't get my stories on page
ten, you're getting page one?

1234
01:22:19,981 --> 01:22:22,074
Doggy-doo is a
real issue, George.

1235
01:22:23,985 --> 01:22:27,546
A powder blue pen to sign the
city's first gay rights law.

1236
01:22:30,024 --> 01:22:33,653
I don't do this enough, taking
swift and unambiguous action

1237
01:22:33,728 --> 01:22:36,253
on a substantive
move for civil rights.

1238
01:22:38,933 --> 01:22:40,298
Congratulations.

1239
01:22:40,868 --> 01:22:42,733
George, we need your help with Briggs.

1240
01:22:42,804 --> 01:22:46,205
The gay community will have your
back on every issue from now on.

1241
01:22:46,274 --> 01:22:48,003
We hope you'll have ours.

1242
01:22:56,484 --> 01:22:58,679
What are you
working on, Dan?

1243
01:23:00,088 --> 01:23:01,555
If you have something
to discuss, Harvey,

1244
01:23:01,622 --> 01:23:04,853
you can have your aide make
an appointment with my aide.

1245
01:23:04,926 --> 01:23:07,952
Dan, I know you're upset
about the psychiatric center.

1246
01:23:09,931 --> 01:23:11,865
What else do you
have coming up?

1247
01:23:11,933 --> 01:23:13,662
Now you need
something from me.

1248
01:23:14,802 --> 01:23:18,465
What do you want, me to support the
queers against Prop 6, is that it?

1249
01:23:18,539 --> 01:23:21,030
We prefer the term gay, Dan.

1250
01:23:21,109 --> 01:23:25,068
Just as I'm sure you prefer the
term Irish-American instead of mick.

1251
01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:29,275
Harvey, a society can't
exist without the family.

1252
01:23:29,350 --> 01:23:31,045
We're not against that.
You're not?

1253
01:23:31,119 --> 01:23:32,882
What, can two men reproduce?

1254
01:23:32,954 --> 01:23:33,943
No.

1255
01:23:34,022 --> 01:23:35,785
But God knows
we keep trying.

1256
01:23:39,127 --> 01:23:40,958
This isn't you, Dan.

1257
01:23:41,029 --> 01:23:43,691
It's like you're
channeling Anita and Briggs.

1258
01:23:44,399 --> 01:23:47,197
We got to be able to work
together on something.

1259
01:23:49,003 --> 01:23:50,630
Okay, Milk,

1260
01:23:51,572 --> 01:23:54,564
introduce an initiative
for supervisor pay raises.

1261
01:23:54,642 --> 01:23:56,872
Dan, we both have elections
coming up. We can't do that.

1262
01:23:56,944 --> 01:23:59,071
No, you asked for something.

1263
01:23:59,147 --> 01:24:03,413
Introduce pay raises, 'cause I can't
take care of my family on our salaries.

1264
01:24:03,484 --> 01:24:06,282
You don't have that
problem, do you?

1265
01:24:15,663 --> 01:24:18,131
<i>Senator John Briggs
apparently has not flinched</i>

1266
01:24:18,199 --> 01:24:22,295
<i>in the face of statewide
criticism of his anti-gay crusade.</i>

1267
01:24:22,370 --> 01:24:25,828
<i>He says polls show most of the
people are still on his side.</i>

1268
01:24:25,907 --> 01:24:29,536
<i>Especially those concerned with the
preservation of the American family.</i>

1269
01:24:29,610 --> 01:24:34,377
<i>If these people are going to live
a life of such open homosexuality,</i>

1270
01:24:35,016 --> 01:24:39,112
<i>that they want a 21 gun salute
every time somebody walks by them,</i>

1271
01:24:40,421 --> 01:24:44,949
<i>those people are going to be in
danger of being removed from their job.</i>

1272
01:24:46,461 --> 01:24:50,955
<i>ALL/
Happy birthday to you</i>

1273
01:24:51,032 --> 01:24:56,834
<i>Happy birthday, dear Harvey</i>

1274
01:24:56,904 --> 01:25:01,967
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

1275
01:25:26,667 --> 01:25:28,134
What's wrong, taco?

1276
01:25:28,202 --> 01:25:30,295
It's just that
Cleve and Anne,

1277
01:25:30,371 --> 01:25:32,896
they tried to cut me
out of your table, baby.

1278
01:25:32,974 --> 01:25:35,704
I'm so sick of them.
You should fire them.

1279
01:25:37,011 --> 01:25:39,206
I'll take it
under consideration.

1280
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:41,714
Would you go
get us some cake?

1281
01:25:41,782 --> 01:25:43,010
Cake?
Yeah.

1282
01:25:43,084 --> 01:25:44,676
Whatever you want.

1283
01:25:49,724 --> 01:25:52,124
Don't let Cesar Chavez
hear you calling him taco.

1284
01:25:52,193 --> 01:25:55,959
He's getting much better. He's
enrolling in classes on Monday, I hope.

1285
01:25:56,030 --> 01:25:58,123
You know, I remember
when your birthdays were

1286
01:25:58,199 --> 01:26:00,190
a lot less lavish and
a little more intimate.

1287
01:26:00,268 --> 01:26:01,792
Who invited you? Anne?

1288
01:26:01,869 --> 01:26:05,100
No, my boyfriend.
I'm his plus one.

1289
01:26:06,774 --> 01:26:09,402
Well, congratulations. It
was a very hard ticket to get.

1290
01:26:09,477 --> 01:26:13,140
Congratulations to you. Looks like
you're part of the machine now.

1291
01:26:14,949 --> 01:26:16,974
By the way,
you can do better.

1292
01:26:17,685 --> 01:26:20,176
When I come home to Jack, I
don't have to talk politics,

1293
01:26:20,254 --> 01:26:23,587
I don't have to talk intelligently.
I don't have to talk at all.

1294
01:26:23,658 --> 01:26:28,027
And besides, where's an ugly old man like
me gonna find a handsome young man like that?

1295
01:26:28,095 --> 01:26:31,292
You're not that old
and you look handsome.

1296
01:26:32,466 --> 01:26:36,562
Happy 48. Looks like you're gonna
make it to 50 after all, Mr. Milk.

1297
01:26:42,176 --> 01:26:44,007
Harvey!

1298
01:26:54,455 --> 01:26:56,514
Harvey, Harvey!

1299
01:26:56,591 --> 01:26:58,491
Is your birthday party
over?

1300
01:26:58,559 --> 01:27:00,789
Well, it's just
winding down. Hi.

1301
01:27:00,861 --> 01:27:03,989
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I
missed your birthday party.

1302
01:27:04,065 --> 01:27:06,499
No, it's no problem.
It's good to see you, Dan.

1303
01:27:06,567 --> 01:27:08,797
I'm sorry. It's good
to see you too, Harvey.

1304
01:27:10,238 --> 01:27:14,675
Oh, I wanted to ask
you about the dog poop.

1305
01:27:14,742 --> 01:27:16,209
Yeah.

1306
01:27:16,277 --> 01:27:19,075
That's good.
It's a really good one.

1307
01:27:19,146 --> 01:27:20,670
It's a good one.

1308
01:27:20,748 --> 01:27:22,682
Hey, I got you
a little something.

1309
01:27:23,317 --> 01:27:24,511
You didn't have to.

1310
01:27:24,585 --> 01:27:26,052
I knew you were
going to say that.

1311
01:27:26,120 --> 01:27:27,849
Why do people
always say that?

1312
01:27:27,922 --> 01:27:30,857
"You didn't have to. ' '
I mean, of course, right?

1313
01:27:30,925 --> 01:27:32,790
But that's what
they always say.

1314
01:27:32,860 --> 01:27:35,158
They always say
things like that.

1315
01:27:35,229 --> 01:27:36,821
Always.

1316
01:27:37,832 --> 01:27:39,299
Are you okay, Dan?

1317
01:27:39,900 --> 01:27:41,458
Yeah.

1318
01:27:41,535 --> 01:27:43,059
Are you okay, Harvey?

1319
01:27:44,071 --> 01:27:45,936
Are we okay?
Okay.

1320
01:27:46,007 --> 01:27:48,475
I've learned a lot from
watching you. I doubt that.

1321
01:27:48,542 --> 01:27:52,205
No, I have. I've realized
you just gotta get out there.

1322
01:27:52,280 --> 01:27:55,181
You gotta be noticed, 'cause
that's how it all works.

1323
01:27:55,249 --> 01:27:58,685
But you have an issue.
See, that's your advantage.

1324
01:28:01,122 --> 01:28:02,521
That's an advantage.

1325
01:28:02,590 --> 01:28:05,354
Dan,
it's more than an issue.

1326
01:28:06,027 --> 01:28:07,619
What?
I...

1327
01:28:08,696 --> 01:28:13,133
Dan, I have had four
relationships in my life.

1328
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:16,397
And three of them have tried to
commit suicide. And that's my fault,

1329
01:28:16,470 --> 01:28:19,871
because I kept them hidden and quiet,
because I was closeted and weak.

1330
01:28:19,940 --> 01:28:22,500
You see what I'm saying?
Yes.

1331
01:28:22,576 --> 01:28:24,567
You do?
Mmm-hmm.

1332
01:28:24,645 --> 01:28:29,412
This is not just jobs or issues,
this is our lives we're fighting for.

1333
01:28:29,483 --> 01:28:31,178
Okay?
All right.

1334
01:28:31,252 --> 01:28:33,311
Okay, Dan... I've learned
a lot from you, Harvey.

1335
01:28:33,387 --> 01:28:34,649
I'm getting back
to my party now.

1336
01:28:34,722 --> 01:28:36,690
I'm going to get my
picture in the papers, too.

1337
01:28:36,757 --> 01:28:40,488
Why are you even here? Why did
you just show up from somewhere?

1338
01:28:40,561 --> 01:28:43,291
I've got my own issues.
Okay.

1339
01:28:43,364 --> 01:28:45,423
I've got my own issues.
Thank you.

1340
01:28:45,499 --> 01:28:47,865
"Thank you. ' ' Whatever.

1341
01:28:47,935 --> 01:28:53,567
I don't even know who you are. You just
showed up out of nowhere, Latino man.

1342
01:28:54,742 --> 01:28:57,267
Dan White's got an issue!

1343
01:28:59,780 --> 01:29:03,216
<i>John Briggs said this morning that Dade
County, Oklahoma, and St. Paul, Minnesota</i>

1344
01:29:03,284 --> 01:29:05,047
<i>were only preliminary battles.</i>

1345
01:29:05,119 --> 01:29:10,056
<i>He called his California campaign against
homosexual teachers the main event.</i>

1346
01:29:10,124 --> 01:29:12,752
<i>What it's doing, what
these people are doing is</i>

1347
01:29:12,827 --> 01:29:16,388
<i>changing our morals from our religious
background. And I don't want that.</i>

1348
01:30:03,210 --> 01:30:05,303
This came in
the mail today.

1349
01:30:06,714 --> 01:30:10,514
"You get the first bullet the minute
you stand at the microphone. ' '

1350
01:30:10,584 --> 01:30:12,142
<i>...Supervisor Harvey Milk.</i>

1351
01:30:12,219 --> 01:30:15,382
Well, publicity's working.

1352
01:30:15,456 --> 01:30:17,390
You don't have
to go up there.

1353
01:30:18,559 --> 01:30:21,357
The whole nation is watching.
I have to go.

1354
01:30:35,943 --> 01:30:40,573
<i>My name is Harvey Milk
and I'm here to recruit you!</i>

1355
01:30:42,817 --> 01:30:47,845
<i>I want to recruit you for the
fight to preserve your democracy!</i>

1356
01:30:47,922 --> 01:30:51,585
<i>Brothers and sisters,
you must come out!</i>

1357
01:30:51,659 --> 01:30:53,820
<i>Come out to your parents,</i>

1358
01:30:53,894 --> 01:30:58,194
<i>come out to your friends, if
indeed they are your friends.</i>

1359
01:30:58,265 --> 01:31:02,099
<i>Come out to your neighbors,
come out to your fellow workers.</i>

1360
01:31:02,169 --> 01:31:06,162
<i>Once and for all, let's
break down the myths</i>

1361
01:31:06,240 --> 01:31:09,971
<i>and destroy the lies
and distortions.</i>

1362
01:31:12,446 --> 01:31:16,314
<i>For your sake,
for their sake.</i>

1363
01:31:16,383 --> 01:31:21,047
<i>For the sake of all the
youngsters who've been scared</i>

1364
01:31:21,121 --> 01:31:24,090
<i>by the votes from Dade to Eugene.</i>

1365
01:31:27,962 --> 01:31:30,692
<i>On the Statue of Liberty,
it says,</i>

1366
01:31:31,565 --> 01:31:37,970
<i>"Give me your tired, your poor, your
huddled masses yearning to be free. "</i>

1367
01:31:40,407 --> 01:31:43,604
<i>In the Declaration of
Independence it is written,</i>

1368
01:31:44,178 --> 01:31:51,550
<i>"All men are created equal and endowed
with certain inalienable rights. "</i>

1369
01:31:59,093 --> 01:32:02,028
<i>So, for Mr. Briggs,</i>

1370
01:32:05,266 --> 01:32:06,597
<i>And Mrs. Bryant,</i>

1371
01:32:09,503 --> 01:32:12,267
<i>And all the bigots
out there,</i>

1372
01:32:13,807 --> 01:32:16,401
<i>no matter how hard you try,</i>

1373
01:32:16,477 --> 01:32:21,744
<i>you can never erase those words
from the Declaration of Independence!</i>

1374
01:32:21,815 --> 01:32:27,082
<i>No matter how hard you try,
you can never chip those words</i>

1375
01:32:27,154 --> 01:32:30,248
<i>from the base of
the Statue of Liberty!</i>

1376
01:32:30,324 --> 01:32:33,816
<i>That is where America is!</i>

1377
01:32:33,894 --> 01:32:36,124
<i>Love it or leave it!</i>

1378
01:32:46,073 --> 01:32:49,167
Okay, the mayor says Briggs is on his way
here and that he could intercept him for us.

1379
01:32:49,243 --> 01:32:51,006
We could get him face to face.
Go get the press.

1380
01:32:51,078 --> 01:32:52,409
All right.

1381
01:32:54,481 --> 01:32:58,212
Well, I see naked men walking
around, naked women walking around,

1382
01:32:58,285 --> 01:33:02,619
which doesn't bother me as far as
my personal standards of nudity,

1383
01:33:02,690 --> 01:33:07,559
but it's not proper. It wouldn't be allowed
for any other parade in San Francisco,

1384
01:33:07,628 --> 01:33:09,994
and it should not be
allowed for the Gay Parade.

1385
01:33:48,502 --> 01:33:50,561
I have a right to be at
this parade, Mr. Mayor.

1386
01:33:50,638 --> 01:33:52,572
I'm afraid it's not in the
interest of your safety,

1387
01:33:52,640 --> 01:33:55,768
or my public's safety to let
you into these parade grounds.

1388
01:33:57,411 --> 01:34:01,006
I'm Harvey Milk. It's an
honor to meet you, Mr. Briggs.

1389
01:34:02,850 --> 01:34:04,442
Yeah, no, I'm aware.

1390
01:34:04,518 --> 01:34:08,113
You know, it's sad, Mr. Milk, that
you're afraid to fight this out in public.

1391
01:34:08,188 --> 01:34:09,280
Oh, that's not true.

1392
01:34:09,356 --> 01:34:11,119
I'd very much like to have
a public debate with you.

1393
01:34:11,191 --> 01:34:13,421
I'm very interested in the
details of your argument.

1394
01:34:13,494 --> 01:34:16,793
Oh, well, you know,
you know the details.

1395
01:34:16,864 --> 01:34:20,766
I mean, just look at the votes across
this nation. The public is with me.

1396
01:34:20,834 --> 01:34:22,233
They are today.

1397
01:34:22,302 --> 01:34:24,532
Which is why
with my city's mayor

1398
01:34:24,605 --> 01:34:27,005
and the San Francisco
press as my witnesses,

1399
01:34:27,074 --> 01:34:29,634
I'd like to challenge
you to a public debate.

1400
01:34:34,915 --> 01:34:36,507
Oh, I think
that's a yes.

1401
01:34:38,986 --> 01:34:43,548
<i>You know, Mr. Milk, we don't allow
people who practice bestiality</i>

1402
01:34:43,624 --> 01:34:46,092
<i>To teach our children,
and... Excuse me,</i>

1403
01:34:46,160 --> 01:34:48,390
<i>and the reason we don't
is because it is illegal.</i>

1404
01:34:48,462 --> 01:34:51,556
<i>It is not illegal to be a
homosexual in California.</i>

1405
01:34:51,632 --> 01:34:53,566
<i>And your law goes
even further.</i>

1406
01:34:54,401 --> 01:34:58,064
<i>Any school employee who even
supports a gay person will be fired.</i>

1407
01:34:58,138 --> 01:35:00,936
<i>Well, that's true. But gay people
don't have any children of their own.</i>

1408
01:35:01,008 --> 01:35:03,568
<i>And if they don't recruit our
children, they'd all just die away.</i>

1409
01:35:04,878 --> 01:35:07,472
<i>You know? And that's why they're all
so interested in becoming teachers,</i>

1410
01:35:07,548 --> 01:35:11,507
<i>because they want to encourage
our children to join them.</i>

1411
01:35:13,487 --> 01:35:15,079
<i>And how do you
teach homosexuality?</i>

1412
01:35:15,155 --> 01:35:16,179
<i>It's like French?</i>

1413
01:35:19,126 --> 01:35:21,492
<i>I was born of
heterosexual parents,</i>

1414
01:35:21,562 --> 01:35:23,655
<i>taught by
heterosexual teachers</i>

1415
01:35:23,731 --> 01:35:26,359
<i>in a fiercely
heterosexual society.</i>

1416
01:35:26,433 --> 01:35:28,560
<i>So why then
am I homosexual?</i>

1417
01:35:28,635 --> 01:35:30,330
<i>And no offense meant,</i>

1418
01:35:30,404 --> 01:35:33,271
<i>but if it were true that
children mimicked their teachers,</i>

1419
01:35:33,340 --> 01:35:35,501
<i>we'd have a hell of a lot
more nuns running around.</i>

1420
01:35:43,450 --> 01:35:48,012
We were really, genuinely
frightened by Proposition 6.

1421
01:35:49,256 --> 01:35:53,454
And with Anita and Briggs gaining
strength, we were very pessimistic.

1422
01:35:54,495 --> 01:35:57,521
We didn't think that there was
any chance that we could beat it.

1423
01:35:57,598 --> 01:36:00,066
But what we did hope for

1424
01:36:00,134 --> 01:36:02,466
<i>is that we could
organize enough,</i>

1425
01:36:03,103 --> 01:36:07,005
<i>so that when we did lose,
all hell would break loose.</i>

1426
01:36:07,074 --> 01:36:10,202
We're still losing 60-30. We got
to take this show on the road.

1427
01:36:10,277 --> 01:36:11,676
Put out a press release.

1428
01:36:11,745 --> 01:36:14,805
Call Briggs' office, tell him he
can pick the audience, the town.

1429
01:36:14,882 --> 01:36:16,816
I'll tell my supporters
to stay away.

1430
01:36:16,884 --> 01:36:20,445
Harvey, his audiences are
intensely devout. You'll get killed.

1431
01:36:21,188 --> 01:36:23,122
Get me Orange County.

1432
01:36:23,690 --> 01:36:27,182
<i>In your statements here and all
these newspapers and tonight,</i>

1433
01:36:27,261 --> 01:36:30,059
<i>you say that child
molestation is not an issue.</i>

1434
01:36:30,130 --> 01:36:31,825
<i>If it's not an issue,</i>

1435
01:36:31,899 --> 01:36:35,391
<i>why do you put out literature
that hammers it home?</i>

1436
01:36:35,469 --> 01:36:38,905
<i>Why do you play on
this myth and fear?</i>

1437
01:36:38,972 --> 01:36:41,406
<i>Same thing with VD, Harvey,
we put out publications...</i>

1438
01:36:41,475 --> 01:36:42,635
<i>This is campaign
literature.</i>

1439
01:36:42,709 --> 01:36:46,304
<i>Well, we put out publications
about VD so you can avoid it.</i>

1440
01:36:53,153 --> 01:36:56,782
<i>You yourself had said that there's more
molestation in the heterosexual group,</i>

1441
01:36:56,857 --> 01:37:00,054
<i>So why not get rid of
the heterosexual teachers?</i>

1442
01:37:00,127 --> 01:37:03,790
<i>We are not talking about
homosex... About child molestation.</i>

1443
01:37:03,864 --> 01:37:09,632
<i>Nearly... The fact is, nearly 95
percent of the people are heterosexual,</i>

1444
01:37:09,703 --> 01:37:13,002
<i>so, if we took the heterosexuals
out and the homosexuals out,</i>

1445
01:37:13,073 --> 01:37:14,734
<i>you know what,
we'd have no teachers.</i>

1446
01:37:14,808 --> 01:37:16,036
<i>We'd have no teachers,
no more molestation.</i>

1447
01:37:16,109 --> 01:37:18,339
<i>So you're saying that the
percentage of the population</i>

1448
01:37:18,412 --> 01:37:19,674
<i>is equal to the percentage
of child molestation?</i>

1449
01:37:19,746 --> 01:37:21,714
<i>No, no, no,
I'm not saying that, no.</i>

1450
01:37:21,782 --> 01:37:23,249
<i>That's what
you just said.</i>

1451
01:37:23,317 --> 01:37:25,581
<i>No, no, no. I'm not saying that at
all. I am saying that we can't prevent</i>

1452
01:37:25,652 --> 01:37:28,246
<i>child molestation, so
let's just cut our odds down</i>

1453
01:37:28,322 --> 01:37:32,122
<i>by taking out the homosexuals and
keeping in the heterosexual groups.</i>

1454
01:37:34,962 --> 01:37:38,693
<i>Sir, in your drive
for personal power,</i>

1455
01:37:38,765 --> 01:37:41,359
<i>how many careers are you
willing to see destroyed?</i>

1456
01:37:41,435 --> 01:37:46,566
<i>How many lives, in your lust for power,
will you destroy and when will it stop?</i>

1457
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:01,548
Jack, what is it?

1458
01:38:01,622 --> 01:38:03,886
<i>Nothing. Just
wondering when you'll be home.</i>

1459
01:38:03,957 --> 01:38:07,415
You just had them pull me out of my big
vote on the dog shit ordinance for this?

1460
01:38:07,494 --> 01:38:09,394
What, do you do
this on purpose?

1461
01:38:09,463 --> 01:38:11,488
Fuck, Harvey,
it's poop, okay?

1462
01:38:11,565 --> 01:38:14,261
I just hope I'm more
important than poop.

1463
01:38:14,334 --> 01:38:18,703
<i>Look, it's... I just... I don't
know what time I'll be home.</i>

1464
01:38:18,772 --> 01:38:20,239
6:00 or 6:15.

1465
01:38:20,307 --> 01:38:21,797
<i>Okay.
Okay?</i>

1466
01:38:21,875 --> 01:38:23,604
I'm all right.
I'll see you then.

1467
01:38:23,677 --> 01:38:25,167
<i>Okay.
6/15, then.</i>

1468
01:38:28,882 --> 01:38:30,941
Dan, how's the baby?

1469
01:38:31,018 --> 01:38:33,418
You didn't bring up
supervisor pay raises?

1470
01:38:33,487 --> 01:38:36,615
In fact, I heard that you
plan to publicly oppose them.

1471
01:38:36,690 --> 01:38:38,658
Well, I heard that you planned
to vote against them, too.

1472
01:38:38,725 --> 01:38:40,124
Were you setting me up?

1473
01:38:40,193 --> 01:38:43,026
It's not a good time for
me, politically speaking.

1474
01:38:43,630 --> 01:38:46,895
Dan, there's a vote on the
Police Desegregation Settlement.

1475
01:38:46,967 --> 01:38:49,265
You give me that and I'll
consider backing pay raises.

1476
01:38:49,336 --> 01:38:51,429
I don't trade votes.

1477
01:38:51,505 --> 01:38:52,995
Unlike you,
the way I was raised,

1478
01:38:53,073 --> 01:38:56,008
we believe in right and
wrong. Moral and immoral.

1479
01:38:56,076 --> 01:38:58,670
Black skin and white
in the police department.

1480
01:38:58,745 --> 01:39:02,442
Dan, even Ronald Reagan
is opposed to Proposition 6.

1481
01:39:02,516 --> 01:39:04,416
You're looking more
and more out of touch.

1482
01:39:04,484 --> 01:39:07,214
Okay, if I come out against Prop 6,
it's only going to be for the invasion

1483
01:39:07,287 --> 01:39:08,811
of state's rights issue,
that's it.

1484
01:39:08,889 --> 01:39:11,084
And the potential witch hunt
against you straight people.

1485
01:39:13,894 --> 01:39:17,455
You can't humiliate
me, okay?

1486
01:39:18,131 --> 01:39:21,157
You will not demean me.

1487
01:39:25,706 --> 01:39:29,642
Harvey, we're doing the final
vote. We need to get you back.

1488
01:39:44,191 --> 01:39:45,351
Jack?

1489
01:39:49,029 --> 01:39:50,189
Jack?

1490
01:39:57,604 --> 01:39:58,730
Jack?

1491
01:40:13,320 --> 01:40:14,753
Oh!

1492
01:40:14,821 --> 01:40:16,846
No, Jack. Jack, no!

1493
01:40:16,923 --> 01:40:20,154
No, no, no. Jack, no.

1494
01:40:22,829 --> 01:40:23,818
Jack!

1495
01:40:24,731 --> 01:40:28,861
No, no, no, no!
Oh, no!

1496
01:40:35,075 --> 01:40:36,508
Harvey,

1497
01:40:37,978 --> 01:40:39,377
look at me.

1498
01:40:40,380 --> 01:40:42,245
Hey, look at me.

1499
01:40:43,316 --> 01:40:45,477
You did everything
that you could.

1500
01:40:48,555 --> 01:40:50,216
No, I didn't.

1501
01:40:51,691 --> 01:40:53,591
What more could
you have done?

1502
01:40:55,695 --> 01:41:00,758
I could have come back
at 6:00 instead of 6:15.

1503
01:41:03,770 --> 01:41:05,237
Shh.

1504
01:41:07,774 --> 01:41:10,834
Jack was gone. I didn't
have any time to mourn.

1505
01:41:10,911 --> 01:41:12,572
There was no choice.

1506
01:41:13,246 --> 01:41:16,613
I had to keep on...
Keep on fighting.

1507
01:41:18,652 --> 01:41:20,517
<i>Most
California political leaders,</i>

1508
01:41:20,587 --> 01:41:23,647
<i>from Governor Jerry Brown to
former Governor Ronald Reagan,</i>

1509
01:41:23,723 --> 01:41:27,352
<i>say there are already enough laws
on the books to protect children.</i>

1510
01:41:27,427 --> 01:41:29,827
<i>If you allow one,
just one human being</i>

1511
01:41:29,896 --> 01:41:33,195
<i>to be allowed to have his
rights taken away from him,</i>

1512
01:41:33,266 --> 01:41:35,097
<i>as a human being
then, pal,</i>

1513
01:41:35,168 --> 01:41:37,500
<i>you don't have any right when
they come to take away your rights!</i>

1514
01:41:37,571 --> 01:41:40,165
<i>You do what you want in
the privacy of your own home.</i>

1515
01:41:40,240 --> 01:41:42,538
<i>But don't tell me I got
to accept it in mine.</i>

1516
01:41:50,484 --> 01:41:52,816
San Bernadino is coming in.
Not good.

1517
01:41:52,886 --> 01:41:54,217
Of course not.
How not good?

1518
01:41:54,287 --> 01:41:56,687
60% for Briggs.
Same in Fresno.

1519
01:41:56,756 --> 01:41:58,747
Oh, dear God,
Lotus Blossom.

1520
01:41:58,825 --> 01:42:01,953
Imperial is
69% for so far.

1521
01:42:02,028 --> 01:42:03,461
Put it on the board.

1522
01:42:03,530 --> 01:42:06,761
<i>I love homosexuals,
if you can believe that.</i>

1523
01:42:06,833 --> 01:42:08,528
<i>I love them enough
to tell them the truth.</i>

1524
01:42:08,602 --> 01:42:12,504
<i>I think that if it were passed, it
would be just what some people would need</i>

1525
01:42:12,572 --> 01:42:14,301
<i>to conduct a very
severe witch hunt.</i>

1526
01:42:14,374 --> 01:42:17,775
<i>What I ask, everybody to
vote against Proposition 6.</i>

1527
01:42:23,750 --> 01:42:28,016
The whole world is watching. This is
San Francisco we're losing. You ready?

1528
01:42:28,822 --> 01:42:31,985
I can have 15,000
people here in an hour,

1529
01:42:32,058 --> 01:42:34,424
but there's gonna be
riots if this thing passes.

1530
01:42:34,494 --> 01:42:36,325
There goddamn
well better be.

1531
01:42:37,497 --> 01:42:39,089
What are you telling me?

1532
01:42:39,166 --> 01:42:41,600
I can't say this because
I'm a public official,

1533
01:42:41,668 --> 01:42:45,866
but if this thing passes,
fight the hell back.

1534
01:42:45,939 --> 01:42:48,499
<i>It was fundamentalist
Christians who helped Briggs</i>

1535
01:42:48,575 --> 01:42:52,136
<i>gather most of the signatures to
put Proposition 6 on today's ballot.</i>

1536
01:42:52,212 --> 01:42:54,442
<i>The Christian community
had never been involved</i>

1537
01:42:54,514 --> 01:42:56,744
<i>in any political
controversial issue.</i>

1538
01:42:56,816 --> 01:42:59,614
<i>And they're not only involved,
but they're committed.</i>

1539
01:42:59,686 --> 01:43:02,211
<i>They've not only been working very hard,
but they're going to come out and vote today.</i>

1540
01:43:02,289 --> 01:43:04,849
<i>"Thou shalt love thy
neighbor as thyself. "</i>

1541
01:43:04,925 --> 01:43:07,553
<i>And I would like to know
how you, Senator Briggs,</i>

1542
01:43:07,627 --> 01:43:12,690
<i>believe that Proposition 6 will help
children learn how to accept people</i>

1543
01:43:12,766 --> 01:43:14,256
<i>who are different
from themselves.</i>

1544
01:43:14,334 --> 01:43:16,529
Harvey,
Don Amador from LA.

1545
01:43:18,138 --> 01:43:19,366
Not a good time, Don.

1546
01:43:19,439 --> 01:43:22,169
<i>No, sir, this is Paul.
Don just gave me the phone.</i>

1547
01:43:22,242 --> 01:43:23,368
Paul who?

1548
01:43:23,443 --> 01:43:25,308
<i>You spoke to me on the
phone a year or so ago.</i>

1549
01:43:25,378 --> 01:43:28,575
<i>I'm in a wheelchair.
I'm from Minnesota.</i>

1550
01:43:28,648 --> 01:43:31,048
I thought you were
a goner, Paul.

1551
01:43:31,785 --> 01:43:34,948
When I saw that you
won the supervisor seat,

1552
01:43:35,021 --> 01:43:37,489
I got a friend to
put me on a bus to LA.

1553
01:43:37,557 --> 01:43:39,491
<i>Who do you know
in Los Angeles?</i>

1554
01:43:40,727 --> 01:43:42,319
Nobody.

1555
01:43:42,395 --> 01:43:43,987
That's the...

1556
01:43:46,166 --> 01:43:47,929
I just didn't
want to die anymore.

1557
01:43:48,001 --> 01:43:50,231
<i>I met your friend Don
down here.</i>

1558
01:43:50,303 --> 01:43:53,067
<i>I turned 18 and I voted
today against Prop 6.</i>

1559
01:43:53,139 --> 01:43:55,437
<i>I don't think I'd be alive
right now if it weren't for you.</i>

1560
01:43:55,508 --> 01:43:57,442
No, you did that all by yourself, Paul.

1561
01:43:57,510 --> 01:44:00,070
<i>Don wanted me to congratulate
you on what he says</i>

1562
01:44:00,146 --> 01:44:03,775
<i>looks like a big win for us
tonight. Congratulations, Mr. Milk.</i>

1563
01:44:08,989 --> 01:44:10,752
Yeah, I know,
it's incredible.

1564
01:44:10,824 --> 01:44:14,191
All the precincts have reported
we've won 65% in LA County.

1565
01:44:14,261 --> 01:44:15,922
<i>It's huge, Harvey.</i>

1566
01:44:15,996 --> 01:44:17,827
I got to go, Don.

1567
01:44:17,897 --> 01:44:22,766
We just took LA County by
65%. Put it up! Put it up!

1568
01:44:33,146 --> 01:44:34,340
Okay, okay.

1569
01:44:34,414 --> 01:44:36,245
What, Jim? Jim, what? Okay, okay!

1570
01:44:36,316 --> 01:44:38,614
The polls were way off.
Briggs is going down by 2 to 1.

1571
01:44:38,685 --> 01:44:42,018
The only place it's going to pass in
San Francisco is Dan White's district.

1572
01:44:43,189 --> 01:44:45,589
Somebody, cover up
Lady Liberty!

1573
01:44:45,659 --> 01:44:48,423
The cameras are
on the way here.

1574
01:45:32,138 --> 01:45:36,336
<i>Tonight, it's become clear
to everyone out there</i>

1575
01:45:36,409 --> 01:45:39,435
<i>that they do know one of us,
and now that they do,</i>

1576
01:45:39,512 --> 01:45:41,537
<i>they can see that
we're not sick.</i>

1577
01:45:42,349 --> 01:45:44,817
<i>They can feel that
we are not wrong.</i>

1578
01:45:45,719 --> 01:45:50,281
<i>And they know that there must
be, that there should be a place</i>

1579
01:45:50,357 --> 01:45:55,090
<i>for us in this great
country, in this world.</i>

1580
01:46:01,434 --> 01:46:06,462
A message of hope has been
sent to all those young people,

1581
01:46:06,539 --> 01:46:10,168
to all of those who've been
afraid by this wave of hate,

1582
01:46:10,243 --> 01:46:14,407
to all of those who have lost
their homes, lost their hometowns.

1583
01:46:14,481 --> 01:46:20,215
Tonight, we are clear that
there is a place for us!

1584
01:46:20,286 --> 01:46:23,585
My brothers and sisters,
we can come home again!

1585
01:46:48,014 --> 01:46:50,073
Oh, good morning, Dan.

1586
01:46:50,150 --> 01:46:53,278
Morning, Harvey,
I just resigned.

1587
01:46:54,020 --> 01:46:57,683
Congratulations. I'm sure you'll
be the next President of the Board.

1588
01:47:01,127 --> 01:47:04,426
Hey, Dan.
Just got word.

1589
01:47:04,497 --> 01:47:06,795
Can we talk to you for a minute?

1590
01:47:07,367 --> 01:47:08,629
Yeah, sure.

1591
01:47:08,701 --> 01:47:11,101
The association
meeting room.

1592
01:47:25,652 --> 01:47:28,780
<i>Well, now it starts all over
again, because this morning,</i>

1593
01:47:28,855 --> 01:47:34,054
<i>former Supervisor Dan White says he wants
to be called supervisor one more time.</i>

1594
01:47:34,127 --> 01:47:38,587
He gets dragged into this closed
door meeting at Police Association.

1595
01:47:38,665 --> 01:47:40,189
Suddenly
he wants his job back.

1596
01:47:40,266 --> 01:47:41,858
I mean, who knows what they
might have said to him in there.

1597
01:47:41,935 --> 01:47:43,869
Or what they may
have promised him.

1598
01:47:43,937 --> 01:47:45,427
Or worse yet, if they
had threatened him.

1599
01:47:45,505 --> 01:47:47,996
A man has the right to change
his mind. Give me some peace.

1600
01:47:48,074 --> 01:47:51,601
Dan White has been the vote on the
board that has stood in our way.

1601
01:47:51,678 --> 01:47:53,441
The vote.
I get it, Harvey.

1602
01:47:53,513 --> 01:47:55,378
I've been lobbied all week.
Enough.

1603
01:47:56,649 --> 01:47:59,846
Let me remind you of something,
you're up for re-election.

1604
01:47:59,919 --> 01:48:03,184
If you reappoint Dan White, you will
lose the gay vote. They listen to me.

1605
01:48:03,256 --> 01:48:05,417
You will not be
elected dog catcher.

1606
01:48:08,361 --> 01:48:10,693
I'll make
my decision on Monday.

1607
01:48:11,531 --> 01:48:13,829
You know who you
sounded like just now?

1608
01:48:13,900 --> 01:48:16,835
Boss Tweed
or Mayor Daly.

1609
01:48:19,005 --> 01:48:20,597
I like that.

1610
01:48:23,309 --> 01:48:25,869
A homosexual with power.

1611
01:48:27,247 --> 01:48:29,044
That's scary.

1612
01:49:38,184 --> 01:49:39,845
Hello.

1613
01:49:39,919 --> 01:49:41,648
Yes, hold on, please.

1614
01:49:43,690 --> 01:49:45,157
Thank you.

1615
01:49:46,225 --> 01:49:47,624
Yes, this is Dan White.

1616
01:49:47,694 --> 01:49:50,254
<i>Hi, Mr. White, this is
Barbara Taylor from KCBS.</i>

1617
01:49:50,330 --> 01:49:51,422
Mmm-hmm.

1618
01:49:51,497 --> 01:49:53,397
<i>I'm interested
in your reaction.</i>

1619
01:49:53,466 --> 01:49:56,196
<i>I've received information
from the mayor's office</i>

1620
01:49:56,269 --> 01:49:59,363
<i>that you're not
getting your job back.</i>

1621
01:50:01,374 --> 01:50:04,275
I'm sorry, I don't know
anything about that.

1622
01:50:21,995 --> 01:50:23,223
Hello?

1623
01:50:23,296 --> 01:50:24,923
<i>Did I wake you?</i>

1624
01:50:26,899 --> 01:50:29,231
Harvey?
Are you all right?

1625
01:50:29,902 --> 01:50:34,168
I went to the opera tonight.
Guess who I went with.

1626
01:50:35,241 --> 01:50:36,333
<i>Who?</i>

1627
01:50:36,409 --> 01:50:38,934
Bidu Sayao herself.

1628
01:50:39,012 --> 01:50:42,413
She was my first Puccini.
The crowd went wild.

1629
01:50:42,482 --> 01:50:46,782
I felt like I was young
again, being at my first opera.

1630
01:50:59,165 --> 01:51:02,032
Maybe you should tell me the
next time you go to the opera.

1631
01:51:03,136 --> 01:51:04,535
Really?

1632
01:51:04,604 --> 01:51:06,902
<i>Yeah. I'd go with you.</i>

1633
01:51:09,976 --> 01:51:11,500
I'd like that.

1634
01:51:27,627 --> 01:51:29,857
Look outside,
the sun's coming up.

1635
01:51:29,929 --> 01:51:31,920
<i>Okay, hang on.</i>

1636
01:51:56,723 --> 01:51:58,281
Hey, wait a minute.

1637
01:51:58,357 --> 01:52:00,484
My aide was supposed to come down here

1638
01:52:00,560 --> 01:52:02,585
and let me in the side door,
but she never showed up.

1639
01:52:02,662 --> 01:52:05,130
And you are? I'm Dan
White, City Supervisor.

1640
01:52:13,573 --> 01:52:14,699
Harvey,

1641
01:52:16,642 --> 01:52:19,110
I want you to know
that I am proud of you.

1642
01:53:00,853 --> 01:53:02,753
I don't wanna miss this.

1643
01:53:03,890 --> 01:53:05,517
<i>Miss what?</i>

1644
01:53:08,227 --> 01:53:09,285
This.

1645
01:53:13,866 --> 01:53:17,165
Is he here? Can I see
the mayor for a moment?

1646
01:53:18,371 --> 01:53:20,896
Just a minute,
I'll see if he's available.

1647
01:53:23,309 --> 01:53:25,675
Sir, Dan White
is here to see you.

1648
01:53:30,016 --> 01:53:32,041
So, who are they gonna replace Dan with?

1649
01:53:32,118 --> 01:53:35,383
That goddamn lefty
liberal, Don Horanzy?

1650
01:53:35,454 --> 01:53:37,285
That'll really
shake up the board.

1651
01:53:37,356 --> 01:53:40,086
All I know is that we're
getting a new supervisor today.

1652
01:53:40,159 --> 01:53:43,322
If Dan shows up,
just avoid him.

1653
01:53:43,396 --> 01:53:45,864
We don't need a scene
today, do we, Harvey?

1654
01:53:46,465 --> 01:53:47,955
God forbid, Dianne.

1655
01:53:50,436 --> 01:53:53,234
Mr. White,
the mayor will see you now.

1656
01:53:56,475 --> 01:53:57,806
Thanks.
You're welcome.

1657
01:53:57,877 --> 01:54:00,209
Dan, come on in.

1658
01:54:02,615 --> 01:54:04,446
It's not something that
I wanna calm down about.

1659
01:54:04,517 --> 01:54:06,280
You can't take
this away from me.

1660
01:54:06,352 --> 01:54:09,253
Dan, look,
you made a decision.

1661
01:54:09,322 --> 01:54:11,313
You know,
you made the decision.

1662
01:54:13,259 --> 01:54:16,854
The issue is what's fair to the
people of your district, Dan.

1663
01:54:16,929 --> 01:54:21,059
Now, look, take some time
off. Spend it with your family.

1664
01:55:07,413 --> 01:55:11,645
Tell President Carter we're coming
after him next, this time next year.

1665
01:55:11,717 --> 01:55:12,809
Hi, Dianne.

1666
01:55:12,885 --> 01:55:15,080
We're marching
to Washington D.C.

1667
01:55:18,024 --> 01:55:20,288
Hey, can I see you in
my office for a minute?

1668
01:55:22,662 --> 01:55:26,120
Sure. I'll be back.
Yeah.

1669
01:55:44,617 --> 01:55:45,845
No.

1670
01:56:27,693 --> 01:56:29,854
Well,
you know what I think?

1671
01:56:29,929 --> 01:56:32,659
I think you need
to find a new scene.

1672
01:56:32,732 --> 01:56:34,324
And some new friends.

1673
01:56:36,969 --> 01:56:38,800
I need a change.

1674
01:56:42,174 --> 01:56:44,267
You're 40 now.
Oh.

1675
01:56:49,148 --> 01:56:54,245
Forty years old and I haven't
done a thing I'm proud of.

1676
01:56:56,122 --> 01:57:00,718
Keep eating all that cake, you're gonna
be a fat-ass by the time you're 50.

1677
01:57:00,793 --> 01:57:03,762
No, I'll never make it to 50.

1678
01:57:49,275 --> 01:57:50,867
Where is everyone?

1679
01:57:51,877 --> 01:57:53,606
Doesn't anyone
give a damn?

1680
01:57:54,547 --> 01:57:57,380
Cleve's getting some people
together in the Castro.

1681
01:58:04,824 --> 01:58:09,386
Last week I got a phone call
from Altoona, Pennsylvania.

1682
01:58:10,496 --> 01:58:16,332
The voice was very young,
and the person said, "Thanks. ' '

1683
01:58:17,670 --> 01:58:22,403
<i>You've got to elect gay people
so that the young child</i>

1684
01:58:23,008 --> 01:58:26,136
<i>and the thousands upon
thousands just like him</i>

1685
01:58:27,046 --> 01:58:29,708
<i>will have hope
for a better life.</i>

1686
01:58:30,850 --> 01:58:33,250
<i>Hope for a better tomorrow.</i>

1687
01:58:50,736 --> 01:58:52,203
<i>I ask this,</i>

1688
01:58:53,739 --> 01:58:56,674
<i>that if there be
an assassination,</i>

1689
01:58:58,310 --> 01:59:04,510
<i>I would want five, ten,
a hundred, a thousand to rise.</i>

1690
01:59:09,255 --> 01:59:13,589
<i>If a bullet should enter my brain,
let it destroy every closet door.</i>

1691
01:59:15,127 --> 01:59:22,329
<i>I ask for the movement to continue
because it's not about personal gain,</i>

1692
01:59:22,401 --> 01:59:25,564
<i>and it's not about ego
and it's not about power.</i>

1693
01:59:26,338 --> 01:59:28,863
<i>It's about the
"us's" out there.</i>

1694
01:59:30,242 --> 01:59:34,008
<i>Not just the gays but
the blacks and the Asians</i>

1695
01:59:34,079 --> 01:59:35,979
<i>and the seniors
and the disabled.</i>

1696
01:59:36,048 --> 01:59:37,276
<i>The "us's. "</i>

1697
01:59:40,953 --> 01:59:44,320
<i>Without hope,
the "us's" give up.</i>

1698
01:59:46,525 --> 01:59:50,621
<i>And I know you can't
live on hope alone.</i>

1699
01:59:50,696 --> 01:59:55,395
<i>But without hope,
life is not worth living.</i>

1700
01:59:57,770 --> 01:59:59,169
<i>So you,</i>

1701
02:00:00,139 --> 02:00:01,697
<i>and you,</i>

1702
02:00:02,208 --> 02:00:03,573
<i>and you,</i>

1703
02:00:03,943 --> 02:00:05,968
you got to give them hope.

1704
02:00:07,813 --> 02:00:10,304
You got to give them hope.
