l don't know!

24
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,680
Richard, he has nowhere else to go.

25
00:03:47,889 --> 00:03:50,560
l'm not smoking. l'm not.

26
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,439
Look, l'm at the hospital.
Yeah, OK. Bye.

27
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,759
Ms Hoover? Your brother's fine.

28
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:27,550
Keep him away
from sharp objects - knives, scissors.

29
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:32,100
lf you have medications, depressants,
in your house, keep them secure.

30
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:36,810
- l'd prefer to keep him, but...
- Yeah, l know. The insurance.

31
00:04:36,899 --> 00:04:39,480
You wanna see him?

32
00:04:53,659 --> 00:04:55,829
Hey, Frank.

33
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:59,079
Sheryl.

34
00:05:00,129 --> 00:05:02,709
l'm so glad you're still here.

35
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:08,839
Well, that makes one of us.

36
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:12,350
..will pass out across New Mexico tonight,

37
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:15,139
bringing with it moisture
that will cool things off.

38
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:21,230
We may even see a five- to ten-degree drop
in temperatures in Albuquerque.

39
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:23,610
You wanna talk or not?

40
00:05:24,649 --> 00:05:26,319
No.

41
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,209
Hello?

42
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:43,379
Anyone?

43
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:49,090
Down here, we have you with Dwayne.

44
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:56,730
Dwayne, hi. Uncle Frank's here.

45
00:05:59,899 --> 00:06:02,110
He doesn't mind, Frank. We talked.

46
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:09,110
l know, l know. But we can't have
you sleeping alone. The doctor said.

47
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,699
l'm sorry. l have to insist.

48
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:19,620
You'll get along fine. He's really quiet.

49
00:06:19,709 --> 00:06:22,129
And here's your cot.

50
00:06:25,089 --> 00:06:27,209
Please, Frank.

51
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,629
Please.

52
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:35,310
Thank you.

53
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:39,430
l've gotta start dinner.
You come out when you're settled.

54
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:44,730
And just leave the door open.
That's important.

55
00:06:54,870 --> 00:07:00,500
Dwayne, honey. There's a bucket of chicken
in the car. Can you get it? l'll make a salad.

56
00:07:00,579 --> 00:07:02,459
- Olive?
- Yeah?

57
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:04,500
- ls Grandpa with you?
- Yeah.

58
00:07:04,589 --> 00:07:06,920
- What are you guys doing?
- Rehearsing.

59
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,339
- OK. Well, dinner in ten minutes.
- OK.

60
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:14,339
- Hi.
- Hi. Frank's here.

61
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:17,470
Oh, God. Did Stan Grossman call?

62
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,230
Well, check the machine.

63
00:07:20,889 --> 00:07:23,560
Dwayne, please. Come on.
The chicken. lt's in the car.

64
00:07:23,649 --> 00:07:26,269
And will you set the table?
Just do paper plates.

65
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,319
..runner-up in the regional
Little Miss Sunshine...

66
00:07:31,069 --> 00:07:33,659
Hey, it's your sister!

67
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,819
Fuck.

68
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:47,250
Hi. Richard Hoover
for Stan Grossman, please.

69
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,840
Any way to reach him, or...?

70
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:53,840
Well, l'm just wondering
if this darn book deal is done or not.

71
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:56,259
lf...

72
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,259
Yes.

73
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:01,100
OK. Could you have him call me
any time over the weekend?

74
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:05,350
He has my cell number.
Just to let me know we're on.

75
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:07,689
OK? Thank you.

76
00:08:07,769 --> 00:08:11,110
- Bye.
- So what happened with Stan Grossman?

77
00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:14,610
- He's in Scottsdale.
- Why didn't he call?

78
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:17,779
Will you let me worry about this, please?

79
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:22,660
Dwayne, can you check on Frank?
Tell him it's dinnertime.

80
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,870
Olive! Dinnertime!

81
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:27,040
Coming!

82
00:08:31,339 --> 00:08:33,629
What? Dinner?

83
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:41,009
What, you don't talk any more?

84
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,480
Why not?

85
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:47,230
You can talk, you just choose not to?

86
00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:55,029
ls that Nietzsche?

87
00:08:56,279 --> 00:09:00,529
You don't speak
because of Friedrich Nietzsche.

88
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:06,669
Far out.

89
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:18,299
Frank, you can sit here next to Dwayne.
Here's the salad, and...

90
00:09:18,389 --> 00:09:22,009
l'm gonna run and get Sprite for everyone.

91
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:26,980
- Olive, come on! Dinnertime!
- OK.

92
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,820
So, who do you hang out with?

93
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,539
No one?

94
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:58,220
What about your family?

95
00:10:03,389 --> 00:10:05,059
Frank! Hey.

96
00:10:05,139 --> 00:10:09,100
- Richard.
- Good to see you.

97
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:22,779
l'm gonna get Olive.

98
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:25,080
Olive? Dad?

99
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:27,950
You guys, go on and start.

100
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:30,289
- Frank, some Sprite?
- Yes.

101
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:33,590
And l want everyone
to have at least a little salad.

102
00:10:33,669 --> 00:10:35,750
Thanks, Sheryl.

103
00:10:36,629 --> 00:10:38,720
Honey?

104
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:47,389
So, Sheryl, l couldn't help noticing
that Dwayne has stopped speaking.

105
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,769
Yeah, he's taken a vow of silence.

106
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:53,440
- You've taken a vow of silence?
- He's gonna join the Air Force Academy,

107
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:58,779
become a test pilot, and he's taken
a vow of silence until he reaches that goal.

108
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,990
- Hi, Uncle Frank.
- Oh, hey, Olive. Wow.

109
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:06,330
You're getting big. Almost like a real person.

110
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,580
- What happened to your arms?
- Olive.

111
00:11:11,669 --> 00:11:13,879
That's OK. l had a little accident. l'm OK.

112
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:17,169
- How's the routine coming, honey?
- lt's good.

113
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:21,220
- Yeah? Why don't you show it to us?
- l don't know. lt's up to Grandpa.

114
00:11:21,299 --> 00:11:25,389
A couple of days. lt still needs work.
What's that? Chicken?

115
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:29,470
Every night it's the fucking chicken!
Holy God Almighty.

116
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:32,850
ls it possible just once
we could get something to eat

117
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:36,230
- that's not the goddamn fucking chicken?
- Hey, Dad.

118
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,779
Dad! Whenever you want to start cooking
your own food, you're more than welcome.

119
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,360
- At Sunset Manor...
- lf you liked it so much,

120
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:46,909
you shouldn't have gotten yourself
kicked out of there, right?

121
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:55,379
So, when did you start with the vow?

122
00:11:55,460 --> 00:12:01,259
lt's been nine months, Frank.
He hasn't said a word. Not one.

123
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:04,549
l think it shows tremendous discipline.
l really do.

124
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,259
l think we could
learn something from Dwayne.

125
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:10,850
Dwayne has a goal. He has a dream.

126
00:12:10,929 --> 00:12:13,600
lt may not be my dream, it may not be yours,

127
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:17,440
but he's pursuing it
with great conviction and focus.

128
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,029
- l was thinking about the nine steps...
- For crying out loud.

129
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:25,110
..and how Dwayne's utilising at least
seven of 'em in his personal quest.

130
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,450
- Richard, please.
- Well, l'm just saying... Come around.

131
00:12:28,529 --> 00:12:31,330
l think he could use our support.

132
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:35,500
How did it happen?

133
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:38,379
- How did what happen?
- Your accident.

134
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:41,250
- Honey, here.
- Oh, no. That's OK.

135
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:45,129
- Unless you object.
- No, l'm pro-honesty here.

136
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:48,259
l just think, you know, it's up to you.

137
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,350
Be my guest.

138
00:12:51,809 --> 00:12:55,519
Olive, um...
Uncle Frank didn't really have an accident.

139
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,269
What happened was, he tried to kill himself.

140
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,860
You did? Why?

141
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:06,820
Sorry, l don't think this is
an appropriate conversation.

142
00:13:06,909 --> 00:13:10,490
Honey, let's let Uncle Frank
finish his dinner, OK?

143
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:13,789
Why did you wanna kill yourself?

144
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:16,409
- Don't answer the question, Frank.
- Richard!

145
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,789
- He's not gonna answer the question.
- l wanted to kill myself

146
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:22,879
- because l was very unhappy.
- He's sick in the head.

147
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:26,379
l don't think it's an appropriate conversation
for a seven-year-old.

148
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:30,090
- Well, she's gonna find out anyway.
- OK.

149
00:13:30,179 --> 00:13:32,809
Go on, Frank.

150
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,139
Why were you unhappy?

151
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,940
Well, there were a lot of reasons.

152
00:13:41,019 --> 00:13:46,529
Mainly, though, l fell in love
with someone who didn't love me back.

153
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:49,360
- Who?
- One of my grad students.

154
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:52,330
l was very much in love with him.

155
00:13:52,409 --> 00:13:54,409
Him? lt was a boy?

156
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,250
- You fell in love with a boy?
- Yes, l did. Very much so.

157
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:03,629
- That's silly.
- You're right. lt was silly. Very, very silly.

158
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,590
- There's another word for it.
- Dad.

159
00:14:05,669 --> 00:14:09,679
So that's when you tried to kill yourself?

160
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:13,600
Well, no. The boy that l was in love with
fell in love with another man,

161
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:16,519
- Larry Sugarman...
- Who's Larry Sugarman?

162
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,139
Perhaps the second most highly regarded
Proust scholar in the US.

163
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:23,860
- Who's number one?
- That would be me, Rich.

164
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,110
Really?

165
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:27,860
So that's when?

166
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:31,320
No. What happened was, l was a bit upset,

167
00:14:31,409 --> 00:14:35,620
so l said some things l shouldn't have said
and did some things l shouldn't have done.

168
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:41,120
l was fired from my job and forced to move
out of my apartment and into a motel.

169
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,549
And that's when you tried to...

170
00:14:46,629 --> 00:14:49,549
Well, no. Actually, all of that was OK.

171
00:14:49,629 --> 00:14:54,350
What happened was, two days ago
the MacArthur Foundation, in its wisdom,

172
00:14:54,429 --> 00:14:58,220
awarded a genius grant to Larry Sugarman,

173
00:14:58,309 --> 00:15:00,980
and that's when l...

174
00:15:01,059 --> 00:15:03,769
Decided to check out early.

175
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,440
Yes. Yes, and l failed at that as well.

176
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:11,490
Olive, the important thing to understand here

177
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:16,830
is that Uncle Frank gave up on himself. He
made a series of foolish choices - l'm sorry -

178
00:15:16,909 --> 00:15:20,539
and he gave up on himself,
which is something that winners never do.

179
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:25,169
So that's the story, OK?
Now, everyone, just let's move on and...

180
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:28,710
ls he always like this?
How can you stand it?

181
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:32,720
Olive. Tell him about your routine,
why you're doing this.

182
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:36,679
Little Miss Chili Pepper is a beauty contest
for everyone in Albuquerque,

183
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:40,139
but you have to be six or seven,
and you have to be a girl.

184
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:43,019
- This is our sister.
- Cindy.

185
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:46,059
Spring break,
Dwayne went to see his dad in Florida

186
00:15:46,149 --> 00:15:50,570
and Olive went to Laguna to see her cousins.
She made it to the top of the regionals.

187
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:55,159
- l was in second place.
- Well, what do you think your chances are?

188
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,490
l think l can win,
because some of the other girls,

189
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:02,039
they've been doing it longer,
but l practise every day.

190
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:05,000
- Well, good luck.
- lt's not about luck, Frank.

191
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:08,960
Luck is the name losers give to
their own failings. lt's about wanting to win.

192
00:16:09,049 --> 00:16:12,419
Willing yourself to win.
You've gotta want it badder than the rest.

193
00:16:12,509 --> 00:16:14,629
- l do.
- Then you're gonna be a winner.

194
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,049
- Richard...
- lt's the truth.

195
00:16:18,509 --> 00:16:21,059
Actually there is a message
from Cindy on the machine.

196
00:16:21,139 --> 00:16:24,019
Something about Little Mrs Sunshine...?

197
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,649
- What? Little Miss Sunshine?
- Yeah.

198
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:28,519
What?

199
00:16:34,149 --> 00:16:40,370
lt's Cindy. Remember Olive was second
in the regional Little Miss Sunshine?

200
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:45,289
The girl who won had to forfeit her crown -
something about diet pills.

201
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:49,460
Anyway, now she has a place
in the state contest in Redondo...

202
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:55,509
- ..the number is...
- l won, l won!

203
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:58,679
- Finish your dinner!
- What happened?

204
00:16:58,759 --> 00:17:02,600
l'm just calling to... Cindy!
Yeah, we just got it.

205
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:06,019
- Yeah, she basically went crazy.
- l won, l won, l won!

206
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:09,359
No, l didn't get that.
The machine cut you off.

207
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:12,109
OK...

208
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:16,569
Redondo Beach... This Sunday?
Are you guys going?

209
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:19,740
- l'm going! l'm really going!
- Yes?

210
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:22,950
- Well, can you put it off?
- They have to! They have to.

211
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,750
- Well, where does that leave us?
- We can't do it.

212
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:31,289
No, no, l understand that, Cindy. Yeah.
l just... No, l'll just figure it out.

213
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,880
- OK. Bye-bye.
- lt's this Sunday?

214
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,180
- Why can't Jeff and Cindy take her?
- They have some equestrian thing.

215
00:17:37,259 --> 00:17:39,970
They do that horse shit every single weekend.

216
00:17:40,049 --> 00:17:44,349
Well, it's the nationals. They're taking
both horses, so apparently it's a big deal.

217
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,519
What about Olive?

218
00:17:48,099 --> 00:17:51,809
Little Miss Sunshine!
Little Miss Sunshine! l won!

219
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,109
l won!

220
00:17:54,529 --> 00:17:56,279
l'm going! We're going!

221
00:17:56,359 --> 00:17:58,740
- You promised?
- We'll fly out, come back Monday.

222
00:17:58,819 --> 00:18:01,569
- How are you gonna get around?
- We'll rent a car.

223
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:03,789
- And stay in a hotel?
- We can afford it.

224
00:18:03,869 --> 00:18:07,750
- This is our seed money!
- Well, if l had help bringing it in...

225
00:18:07,829 --> 00:18:11,539
- lt all goes to your nine steps.
- l'm gonna talk to Stan Grossman.

226
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:15,380
We'll be locked and loaded on this deal
and start generating some income!

227
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:18,630
- But in the meantime...
- OK, OK! We'll drive!

228
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,799
- l'm not driving.
- How are you gonna fit Grandpa in the Miata?

229
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:23,930
- Grandpa does not have to come.
- What?

230
00:18:24,009 --> 00:18:26,640
l coached her, l gave her the moves.
l gotta go.

231
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:30,599
- Why don't you take the VW?
- l cannot drive a shift. l cannot do it.

232
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:32,859
- We'll fly there.
- We can't afford it!

233
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:37,859
Well, that's what we're gonna do
unless you have a better idea.

234
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,240
Here! This is dessert.

235
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:46,240
l won, l won, l won,
l won, l won, l won, l won!

236
00:18:46,329 --> 00:18:48,660
l won! l won! l won!

237
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:57,130
Little Miss Sunshine!
Little Miss Sunshine! Little Miss Sunshine!

238
00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:00,220
- All right. l'll drive the bus.
- Richard!

239
00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:04,259
l was told explicitly not to leave Frank
by himself. No offence, Frank.

240
00:19:04,349 --> 00:19:06,430
- None taken.
- You got Dwayne here.

241
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:10,390
- They can look after each other.
- No! lf something happened, l'd...

242
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:15,230
We can't go, then,
unless Dwayne and Frank go with us.

243
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:19,859
- Mom! Where's my bathing suit?
- Right...

244
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,819
Frank?

245
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,950
l've found it!

246
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:26,619
OK.

247
00:19:27,869 --> 00:19:30,039
l'm going! l'm going! l'm going!

248
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:33,710
No, Dwayne, come on. Please.
Think of your sister.

249
00:19:35,089 --> 00:19:37,630
Come on, Dwayne.
lt'll be a lot of fun.

250
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:40,299
You can go to the beach, and...

251
00:19:44,089 --> 00:19:46,890
"This is unfair."

252
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:50,680
"All l ask is...

253
00:19:51,269 --> 00:19:54,769
that you leave me alone."

254
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:03,279
Dwayne? Flight school. l will give you
permission for flight school.

255
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:06,069
l've gotta go pack. l won.

256
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:11,250
l can't believe it. l won. l won.
l'm gonna win this one, too!

257
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:22,880
"But l'm not going to...

258
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:26,339
have any fun."

259
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:29,349
- We're all with you on that one.
- Grandpa. Grandpa.

260
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:33,730
- ls Grandpa coming to California?
- We're all coming, honey.

261
00:20:33,809 --> 00:20:38,859
Olive? Come over here for a second.
Come here. Sit down for a second.

262
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:44,950
Look. There's no sense in entering a contest
if you don't think you're gonna win.

263
00:20:45,029 --> 00:20:49,410
So, do you think you can win
Little Miss Sunshine?

264
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:51,160
Richard...

265
00:20:52,539 --> 00:20:54,619
Are you gonna win?

266
00:20:59,589 --> 00:21:01,799
Yes!

267
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:05,509
We're going to California.

268
00:21:12,349 --> 00:21:14,430
Good night, Dwayne.

269
00:21:31,789 --> 00:21:35,789
Not on your watch. l wouldn't do that to you.

270
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,970
Thank you, Dwayne.

271
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,970
Coming from you, that means a lot.

272
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:53,099
Good night.

273
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:50,109
Jesus, l'm tired. l'm so fucking tired.
You know how tired l am?

274
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,529
lf some girl came up to me,
begged me to fuck her, l couldn't do it.

275
00:22:53,619 --> 00:22:55,450
- Dad?
- That's how tired l am.

276
00:22:55,539 --> 00:22:58,750
- Watch the language, huh?
- She's listening to music.

277
00:22:58,829 --> 00:23:03,079
l'll give you a million dollars
if you turn around. See?

278
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:06,960
- All right. But the rest of us.
- Oh, the rest of you.

279
00:23:07,049 --> 00:23:11,299
Can l give you some advice?
Well, l'm gonna give it to you anyway.

280
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:14,390
l don't want you making the same mistakes
l made when l was young.

281
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:19,730
- Can't wait to hear this.
- Dwayne. That's your name, right? Dwayne?

282
00:23:19,809 --> 00:23:24,109
This is the voice of experience talking.
Are you listening?

283
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:28,609
Fuck a lot of women, Dwayne.
Not just one woman. A lot of women.

284
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:33,029
- That's enough, all right? Dad!
- Are you getting any? You can tell me.

285
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:38,490
- Come on. Please.
- No? Jesus! You're, what, 15? My God, man!

286
00:23:38,579 --> 00:23:42,460
You should be getting that young stuff.
That's the best stuff in the world.

287
00:23:42,539 --> 00:23:45,710
- That's enough! Stop it!
- Will you kindly not interrupt me?

288
00:23:45,789 --> 00:23:49,339
See, right now you're jailbait, they're jailbait.
lt's perfect.

289
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:52,970
l mean, you hit 18...
Man! You're talking about three to five.

290
00:23:53,049 --> 00:23:56,930
- l will pull this truck over right now!
- You're not gonna shut me up! Fuck you!

291
00:23:57,009 --> 00:23:59,720
l can say what l want!
l still got Nazi bullets in my ass!

292
00:23:59,809 --> 00:24:00,849
The Nazi bullets!

293
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:05,190
You're as bad
as those fuckers at Sunset Manor!

294
00:24:05,269 --> 00:24:08,769
- What happened at Sunset Manor?
- Frank, don't encourage him.

295
00:24:08,859 --> 00:24:12,190
l'll tell you what happened.
l paid my money, they took my money.

296
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:16,069
- l should be able to do what the fuck l want!
- He started snorting heroin.

297
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,490
- You started snorting heroin?
- l'm old!

298
00:24:18,579 --> 00:24:20,910
- That stuff'll kill you.
- What am l, an idiot?

299
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,789
And don't you start taking that shit.
When you're young, you're crazy to do it.

300
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,039
- What about you?
- What about me? l'm old.

301
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:31,759
- When you get old, you're crazy not to do it.
- We've tried. The intervention was a fiasco.

302
00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:36,049
- He was worse than a two-year-old.
- Can we please talk about something else?

303
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:40,930
- l take it you didn't like it at Sunset Manor.
- Are you kidding? lt was a fucking paradise.

304
00:24:41,019 --> 00:24:43,230
They got a pool, they got golf.

305
00:24:43,309 --> 00:24:47,190
Now l'm stuck with Mr Happy here,
sleeping on a fucking sofa.

306
00:24:47,269 --> 00:24:50,859
Look, l know you're a homo and all,
but maybe you can appreciate this.

307
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:54,400
You go to one of those places,
there's four women for every guy.

308
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:58,029
- Can you imagine what that's like?
- You must have been very busy.

309
00:24:58,119 --> 00:25:01,410
l had second-degree burns on my johnson,
l kid you not.

310
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:05,619
- Forget about it.
- What are you guys talking about?

311
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:08,210
Politics.

312
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:14,759
Fuck a lot of women, kid.
l have no reason to lie to you.

313
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:17,759
Not one woman. A lot of women.

314
00:25:19,349 --> 00:25:21,349
You heard what l said?

315
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:24,599
- Did it go in anywhere?
- l think we get the point, Dad.

316
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:27,440
Don't show me the pad.
l don't wanna see the fucking pad.

317
00:25:31,569 --> 00:25:35,240
- Mom, how much can we spend?
- l would say four dollars.

318
00:25:35,319 --> 00:25:37,240
Anything under four dollars.

319
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:39,490
Hi. You ready?

320
00:25:39,569 --> 00:25:44,660
Yeah. l'm gonna have the number five
with coffee, please.

321
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:49,119
Number seven, over easy,
and a grapefruit juice.

322
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:53,130
l would like a fruit plate, and...
Do you have camomile?

323
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:54,920
- Yes.
- With honey, please.

324
00:25:55,009 --> 00:25:59,089
l would like the Lumberjack and coffee,
and extra bacon.

325
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:01,349
- Extra?
- Dad, you should probably...

326
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:03,680
- Don't start.
- He could kill himself.

327
00:26:03,769 --> 00:26:06,390
- Well, it's his life.
- Thank you, Sheryl.

328
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,390
Garden salad?

329
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,269
- And you?
- l'm sorry. l...

330
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:13,690
- Take your time.
- Don't apologise, Olive.

331
00:26:13,779 --> 00:26:17,279
- lt's a sign of weakness.
- Well, l want...

332
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:19,779
OK, OK. l know what l want.

333
00:26:19,859 --> 00:26:22,740
Can l get the waffles and...?

334
00:26:23,789 --> 00:26:27,660
- l don't... What does "a la modee" mean?
- That means it comes with ice cream.

335
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:31,579
- OK, a la modee, then.
- Olive. For breakfast?

336
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:35,880
- You said four dollars.
- OK. You're right.

337
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,920
OK. Be right back.

338
00:26:38,009 --> 00:26:41,430
Actually, Olive, a la mode, in French,

339
00:26:41,509 --> 00:26:45,259
translates literally as "in the fashion".

340
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:51,190
Mode is derived from Latin, modus,
meaning "due or proper measure".

341
00:26:51,269 --> 00:26:53,269
- Frank, shut up.
- Richard!

342
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:56,730
Olive, can l tell you
a little something about ice cream?

343
00:26:56,819 --> 00:27:00,819
lce cream is made from cream,
which comes from cow's milk,

344
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:03,950
and cream has a lot of fat in it.

345
00:27:04,029 --> 00:27:05,990
- Richard.
- What?

346
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:09,829
- She's gonna find out anyway, remember.
- What? Find out what?

347
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:14,839
Well, when you eat ice cream, the fat
in the ice cream becomes fat in your body.

348
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,799
- Richard, l swear to God...
- What's wrong?

349
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,920
- Nothing, honey.
- So, if you eat a lot of ice cream,

350
00:27:21,009 --> 00:27:24,180
you might become fat,

351
00:27:24,259 --> 00:27:27,680
and if you don't, you're gonna stay
nice and skinny, sweetie.

352
00:27:27,769 --> 00:27:30,099
- Mom...
- Olive, Richard is an idiot.

353
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:35,190
- l like a woman with meat on her bones.
- l don't... Why is everyone so upset?

354
00:27:35,269 --> 00:27:37,859
No one's upset, honey. l...

355
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:41,200
l just want you to understand
it's OK to be skinny,

356
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:46,619
and it's OK to be fat, if that's what
you wanna be. Whatever you want, it's OK.

357
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:49,660
OK. But, Olive, let me ask you this.

358
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:52,789
Those women in Miss America.

359
00:27:52,869 --> 00:27:56,920
Are they skinny, or are they fat?

360
00:27:58,549 --> 00:28:00,759
Honey?

361
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:03,299
Well...

362
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,549
- They're skinny, l guess.
- Yeah.

363
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:11,019
- l guess they don't eat a lot of ice cream.
- OK. Coffee?

364
00:28:11,099 --> 00:28:13,190
Coffee...

365
00:28:13,269 --> 00:28:15,349
- Grapefruit.
- Thank you.

366
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,559
Camomile.

367
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:20,859
And here's your ice cream.
A la modee, right?

368
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:24,279
l'll be back with your waffles in a sec.

369
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:29,539
Does anyone want my ice cream?

370
00:28:29,619 --> 00:28:34,250
Yeah. l'd like a little. Dwayne? Frank?
Olive's not gonna have her ice cream.

371
00:28:34,329 --> 00:28:36,500
- Do you mind if l have a little?
- Let's dig in.

372
00:28:36,579 --> 00:28:39,710
- That looks really good.
- l feel sorry for anybody

373
00:28:39,799 --> 00:28:43,839
that doesn't want to enjoy their ice cream
so early in the morning.

374
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:48,259
Are you sure you don't wanna have some?
These waffles are gonna be awful lonely.

375
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:54,269
- Watch this.
- Wait! Stop! Don't eat it all.

376
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:02,029
- All right, Olive...
- Richard!

377
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,119
Stan?

378
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,740
Stan? lt's Richard. Again.

379
00:29:10,829 --> 00:29:13,500
l know you're busy,
but we're just dying to hear

380
00:29:13,579 --> 00:29:18,420
what sort of numbers you came up with
in Scottsdale, so give me a call, please.

381
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:24,549
- Did you get him?
- No. l can't get a signal out of this thing.

382
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:27,549
- How long till we get there?
- A long time, honey.

383
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:31,559
- l know. But how long?
- We've gotta do 600 miles of driving today

384
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:34,309
and 200 tomorrow.
That's a lot of driving. Let's go!

385
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:36,730
- Honey, l'll drive for a while.
- No, l got it.

386
00:29:36,809 --> 00:29:41,190
No, you're right. l've gotta learn how to
do this. You're doing it. How hard can it be?

387
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:48,779
- Push the stick down harder.
- l'm pushing hard.

388
00:29:48,869 --> 00:29:52,240
OK, there you go. Now push the clutch in
all the way to the floor.

389
00:29:52,329 --> 00:29:54,410
lt's on the floor!

390
00:29:55,289 --> 00:29:57,920
lt's on the floor.

391
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:06,170
That is a sticky one there.

392
00:30:06,259 --> 00:30:07,970
Push down hard.

393
00:30:12,849 --> 00:30:15,640
Well, you got a problem.

394
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:18,890
Your clutch is shot.

395
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:21,940
- Can we get a new one?
- These old buses,

396
00:30:22,019 --> 00:30:26,609
- you have to order the part.
- How long does it take?

397
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:29,359
Well, it's the weekend.

398
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:31,490
So...

399
00:30:31,569 --> 00:30:35,240
Maybe Thursday.

400
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:53,759
ls there a dealership around here?

401
00:30:55,099 --> 00:30:59,559
Well, they're probably gonna be closed.
lt's the weekend, you know.

402
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:02,150
Yes, we're aware of that.

403
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:06,569
l tell you what. You know these old buses?

404
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:11,569
You don't need the clutch
to change from the third to the fourth.

405
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:16,369
You only really need the clutch
to go from number one to number two.

406
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:19,119
But as long as you keep parking on a hill,

407
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:23,329
and you let it go,
and it goes 15, 20 miles per hour,

408
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:27,339
you start it in third,
and then you go from third to fourth.

409
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:32,380
What if you're not on a hill? There's no hill?
What if there's no hill? What do you...?

410
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:34,140
Hey, it's...

411
00:31:39,809 --> 00:31:43,849
Olive? Dad? l want you in the car first.

412
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:47,359
- l know! We know.
- All right. Here we go.

413
00:31:48,819 --> 00:31:51,859
Everybody push! All right.

414
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:55,410
Here we go! Push!

415
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:57,579
Push!

416
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,710
- OK!
- l just want everyone here to know

417
00:32:01,789 --> 00:32:07,789
that l am the pre-eminent Proust scholar
in the United States.

418
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,880
l'm putting it in gear!

419
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:13,759
- Go, honey.
- Come on. Come on, Olive. Run, run!

420
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:16,970
- Come on. Come on.
- Sheryl, let's go!

421
00:32:17,059 --> 00:32:19,140
Sheryl!

422
00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:27,730
- Frank, let's go!
- You're losing them! Slow down!

423
00:32:27,819 --> 00:32:32,319
- Come on, you dumb bastard.
- l can't slow down. l can't slow down!

424
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,700
- Let's go!
- Come on!

425
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,950
Come on! Come on, get in.

426
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,119
No one gets left behind!
No one gets left behind!

427
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:48,539
Outstanding, soldier! Outstanding!

428
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:55,049
Outstanding.

429
00:32:56,089 --> 00:32:58,390
- Was that fun?
- Yeah.

430
00:33:48,269 --> 00:33:53,190
So, finally l'm just sitting there, and l decide,
"This is Stan Grossman. What the hell?"

431
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:58,109
And l start pitching him the nine steps.
And about... l don't know, two minutes in,

432
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:02,619
he stops me, he says, "l can sell this."

433
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:06,369
- lnteresting.
- And this is the guy who knows how to do it.

434
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:11,670
You start with a book, then you do a media
tour, corporate events, DVD VHS series -

435
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:16,550
there's a whole fascinating science
into how you roll these things out.

436
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:22,010
So he's in Scottsdale right now, building the
buzz and getting the whole hype thing going.

437
00:34:22,099 --> 00:34:27,230
He's doing what the pros call
"a ticking clock auction".

438
00:34:27,309 --> 00:34:30,269
How about that?

439
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:36,610
Yeah, and l can detect
that note of sarcasm there, Frank.

440
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:42,119
- What sarcasm? l didn't hear...
- But l want you to know something.

441
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:45,369
- l feel sorry for you.
- You do? Good.

442
00:34:45,449 --> 00:34:49,119
Yeah, l do.
Because sarcasm is the refuge of losers.

443
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:50,500
lt is? Really?

444
00:34:50,579 --> 00:34:54,630
Yep. Sarcasm is losers trying to
bring winners down to their level.

445
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:58,670
- That's step four in the programme.
- You've opened my eyes to what a loser l am.

446
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:02,800
- How much do l owe you for that?
- That one's on the house, buddy.

447
00:35:02,889 --> 00:35:05,679
- OK, you guys. That's enough.
- That was on the house.

448
00:35:05,769 --> 00:35:07,969
- That was for free?
- No charge.

449
00:35:08,059 --> 00:35:10,389
- Stop it!
- He started it.

450
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,150
Wait a second.

451
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:15,769
Quiet. This is it. This is that call.

452
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:18,150
Hello?

453
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:20,150
Stan?

454
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:23,369
Stan?

455
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:32,710
Stan Grossman. Richard Hoover.

456
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:36,630
Finally! How you doing?

457
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:43,800
l know. We were on the highway and l lost
you on my cell. Forget about it. How'd we do?

458
00:35:48,429 --> 00:35:50,769
l'm gonna use the ladies' room.
You need to go?

459
00:35:50,849 --> 00:35:53,980
No. l'm gonna go
practise my routine over there.

460
00:35:54,059 --> 00:35:56,690
OK. Well, don't go too far.

461
00:35:56,769 --> 00:36:02,530
Well, l think we just gotta talk to him a little.
No, you gotta talk to...

462
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:05,199
No, Stan, listen to me. Hold on, now.

463
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,539
l'm going to get something to drink.
You want anything?

464
00:36:08,619 --> 00:36:12,460
- What? Yeah. Get me some porn.
- OK.

465
00:36:12,539 --> 00:36:16,630
Get me something really nasty, too.
l don't want any of that airbrushed shit.

466
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:21,630
OK, here's a 20. Get yourself a little treat, too.
Get yourself a fag rag.

467
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:24,010
All right. l will.

468
00:36:26,179 --> 00:36:29,139
That one. Yes. And that one.

469
00:36:29,219 --> 00:36:33,389
And l would like that one - no, down. Yes.

470
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,809
Yes. Yes, l would like that one.

471
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:41,570
And l will have a blue raspberry Slushee.

472
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:44,699
Frank?

473
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:46,909
Oh, my God. How are you?

474
00:36:46,989 --> 00:36:51,449
l thought you were gonna be in Santa Fe
for the conference. l was looking for you.

475
00:36:51,539 --> 00:36:54,539
- Aren't you supposed to be in New Haven?
- Yeah.

476
00:36:54,619 --> 00:36:57,750
You heard about Larry
and the whole "genius" thing, right?

477
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,960
- lt's official.
- Oh, good.

478
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:03,590
So we're going to this private spa in Sedona
for the week, and then...

479
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:07,889
- Larry's here?
- Yeah. He's out filling the tank. He's...

480
00:37:07,969 --> 00:37:11,059
- Yeah. There he is.
- Wow!

481
00:37:11,139 --> 00:37:16,269
- l can't believe this. How've you been?
- l've been fine.

482
00:37:16,349 --> 00:37:21,780
Good. Good. You know,
l heard that you got fired.

483
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:26,280
Yeah. No. l quit,
because enough is enough, you know?

484
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:29,070
Good. Good.

485
00:37:29,159 --> 00:37:32,239
So, what are you up to now?

486
00:37:32,329 --> 00:37:35,829
l'm weighing my options, and...

487
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,289
..just, you know,
taking some time off, and so...

488
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:41,710
Great. That's great.

489
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,210
19.79, sir.

490
00:37:47,929 --> 00:37:48,969
So...

491
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:56,389
- Well, it's great to see you.
- Yeah, you too.

492
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,230
- Take care of yourself.
- You too. Bye.

493
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,849
You forgot your Slushee.

494
00:38:34,469 --> 00:38:38,559
You're in Scottsdale right now, right?
OK. l can come by.

495
00:38:38,639 --> 00:38:43,690
l'm gonna be coming through there.
l could swing right by. We could...

496
00:38:43,769 --> 00:38:46,480
Christ. He's not getting it.

497
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:54,780
Did you talk to him? Did you try that?
Well, listen to what l'm saying, Stan! l'll...

498
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:05,210
- So, what happened?
- Nothing. Let's get outta here.

499
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:07,920
Wait a minute.
l thought you said this was a done deal.

500
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:11,630
- He said it was a done deal.
- What, you didn't get anything?

501
00:39:11,719 --> 00:39:14,260
- Where does that leave us?
- Fucked, that's where.

502
00:39:14,349 --> 00:39:17,349
l can't believe l'm hearing...
Did you even try negotiating?

503
00:39:17,429 --> 00:39:20,889
Of course l tried! What do you think l...?

504
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:23,650
Let's just go, OK? Let's go, let's go.

505
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:25,820
Come on.

506
00:39:29,739 --> 00:39:31,820
Let's go!

507
00:40:09,739 --> 00:40:11,820
Where's Olive?

508
00:40:26,289 --> 00:40:28,289
All right. Frank?

509
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:31,880
Come on, sweetie. Jump. We can't stop.

510
00:40:31,969 --> 00:40:34,260
l got her. l got her.

511
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,320
Richard.

512
00:40:57,699 --> 00:40:59,780
Yeah?

513
00:40:59,869 --> 00:41:03,409
Whatever happens, you tried
to do something on your own,

514
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:10,420
which is more than most people ever do,
and l include myself in that category.

515
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:15,590
You took a big chance,
and it took guts, and l'm proud of you.

516
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,389
OK, Dad. Thank you.

517
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:32,980
Thank you, Dad.

518
00:42:05,809 --> 00:42:08,349
OK. Here's 11.

519
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,480
Frank, you're 12.

520
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:17,400
- Grandpa's 13.
- Can l sleep with Grandpa tonight?

521
00:42:17,489 --> 00:42:19,739
- You'll have to ask Grandpa.
- Grandpa?

522
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:23,739
We got two beds.
You could still use some rehearsing.

523
00:42:23,829 --> 00:42:26,750
Yeah, that's what l was thinking.

524
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,510
All right, everybody.
We have a long day tomorrow,

525
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:38,550
so l'll knock on your doors at 7am.

526
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:43,639
That means no lollygagging. We need
to be packed and on the road by 7:40, guys.

527
00:42:43,719 --> 00:42:46,179
- Frank, you guys'll be OK?
- We're fine.

528
00:42:46,269 --> 00:42:50,059
- Well, good night. Sleep tight.
- Good night.

529
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:52,400
OK.

530
00:43:08,409 --> 00:43:11,829
What a fucking nightmare.

531
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:14,670
Richard, we have to talk.

532
00:43:15,550 --> 00:43:18,170
Please, Sheryl,

533
00:43:19,219 --> 00:43:22,260
let's just get through this, and go home.

534
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:26,679
- Richard, we have to talk now!
- l tried to tell you we couldn't afford the trip!

535
00:43:26,769 --> 00:43:32,400
- l never realised we were going bankrupt!
- We are not bankrupt.

536
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,269
Don't listen to that.

537
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:36,820
Let's turn on the tube.

538
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:40,449
l'm gonna brush my teeth.

539
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:46,869
Secretary Rumsfeld and l thought long and
hard about this important choice. To meet...

540
00:43:46,949 --> 00:43:49,789
You said this was a lock.
You said it was a done deal.

541
00:43:49,869 --> 00:43:54,500
- Stan Grossman said it was a done deal!
- l'm not married to Stan Grossman!

542
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:58,130
l trusted him, all right?
Trust in order to be trusted. That's step six.

543
00:43:58,210 --> 00:44:02,429
Oh, fuck the nine steps, Richard!
They are not working!

544
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:07,099
Forget it. lt's over. l never want
to hear about the nine steps again!

545
00:44:16,019 --> 00:44:18,940
Perfect. You're the world champion growler.

546
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:22,449
Time for your beauty rest. Get in there.

547
00:44:28,039 --> 00:44:30,329
There you go.

548
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:33,369
Good night.

549
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:35,539
- Grandpa?
- Yeah?

550
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:40,380
- l'm kinda scared about tomorrow.
- Are you kidding me?

551
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:45,090
You're gonna blow 'em out of the water.
They're not gonna know what hit 'em.

552
00:44:45,179 --> 00:44:47,800
- Grandpa?
- Yeah?

553
00:44:48,889 --> 00:44:51,179
- Am l pretty?
- Olive...

554
00:44:54,099 --> 00:44:58,940
You are the most beautiful girl
in the whole world.

555
00:44:59,019 --> 00:45:02,489
- You're just saying that.
- No, l'm not. l'm madly in love with you,

556
00:45:02,570 --> 00:45:06,860
not because of your brains or your
personality. lt's because you're beautiful,

557
00:45:06,949 --> 00:45:09,239
inside and out.

558
00:45:10,449 --> 00:45:12,539
- Grandpa?
- What?

559
00:45:16,539 --> 00:45:19,380
- l don't wanna be a loser.
- You're not a loser.

560
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:25,679
- Where'd you get the idea you're a loser?
- Because Daddy hates losers.

561
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:30,050
Back up a minute.
You know what a loser is?

562
00:45:30,139 --> 00:45:36,480
A real loser is somebody that's so afraid
of not winning, they don't even try.

563
00:45:36,559 --> 00:45:39,309
Now, you're trying, right?

564
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,650
- Yeah.
- Then you're not a loser.

565
00:45:41,730 --> 00:45:45,449
- We're gonna have fun tomorrow, right?
- Yeah.

566
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:50,530
We can tell 'em all to go to hell.

567
00:45:50,619 --> 00:45:53,409
Good night, sweetie. l love you.

568
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:17,769
What are you doing?

569
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:20,730
l'm gonna fix this.

570
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:24,940
Richard...

571
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:28,199
l'm gonna fix this.

572
00:46:55,719 --> 00:46:58,019
Here we go. Here we go.

573
00:46:58,519 --> 00:47:00,730
Here we go.

574
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:26,550
Hi.

575
00:48:42,539 --> 00:48:44,920
Hi. Stan Grossman, please.

576
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:56,340
Stan, it's Richard. l don't know where the fuck
you are. l'm at the hotel. Call me.

577
00:49:08,110 --> 00:49:10,519
He's standing in front of my office,
and he says:

578
00:49:10,610 --> 00:49:15,659
"The book is really a memoir.
lt's from my life experience." He's, like, 20.

579
00:49:18,619 --> 00:49:21,739
So l said, "You want me
to teach you about life experiences?"

580
00:49:21,829 --> 00:49:24,159
"You can write a book about my experiences."

581
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:26,329
So he says to me...

582
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:31,090
Hello, Stan.

583
00:49:31,170 --> 00:49:34,760
- You said it would sell.
- That's what l thought at the time.

584
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:38,719
lt's a great programme!
You said so yourself. l don't understand.

585
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:43,429
lt's not the programme, Richard.
lt's you. OK?

586
00:49:43,519 --> 00:49:47,139
No one's heard of you. Nobody cares.

587
00:49:54,440 --> 00:50:00,119
- What's the next step?
- There is none. We had our shot.

588
00:50:00,199 --> 00:50:02,619
lt didn't fly. We move on.

589
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:05,829
- You mean give up?
- Richard...

590
00:50:07,329 --> 00:50:10,170
One setback and you're ready to just quit?

591
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:13,250
Richard, listen. l pushed this thing hard, OK?

592
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:17,590
l rammed it down their fucking throats,
and no one bought it!

593
00:50:17,679 --> 00:50:20,090
lt's time to move on.

594
00:50:20,179 --> 00:50:22,760
You're not gonna win this one.

595
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:28,269
OK. OK, you know what? Good. l'm glad.

596
00:50:28,349 --> 00:50:32,440
You know why? Because this
is what the nine steps are all about.

597
00:50:32,519 --> 00:50:35,400
- Right here, Stan. Right here.
- Richard, please.

598
00:50:35,489 --> 00:50:38,780
No. You blew it! You blew it, you're out.

599
00:50:47,869 --> 00:50:49,750
Mom?

600
00:50:50,789 --> 00:50:52,880
Dad?

601
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:58,590
What is it, hon?

602
00:50:59,179 --> 00:51:01,469
Grandpa won't wake up.

603
00:51:16,860 --> 00:51:19,610
Wanna take an eye test?

604
00:51:19,699 --> 00:51:21,860
Uncle Frank? An eye test?

605
00:51:24,449 --> 00:51:27,789
Olive, come here. Put those away.
We'll have a family meeting.

606
00:51:27,869 --> 00:51:30,039
Dwayne? Family meeting.

607
00:51:34,039 --> 00:51:40,590
First of all, the doctors are doing everything
they can to help Grandpa right now.

608
00:51:40,679 --> 00:51:46,599
He's had a long, eventful life,
and l know he loves both of you very much.

609
00:51:48,269 --> 00:51:54,440
But if God wants to take him,
we have to be ready to accept that, OK?

610
00:51:54,519 --> 00:51:57,440
Whatever happens...

611
00:51:57,530 --> 00:51:59,610
we're a family.

612
00:52:00,610 --> 00:52:03,699
And what's important
is that we love each other.

613
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:07,199
Cos l love you guys so, so much.

614
00:52:36,150 --> 00:52:40,190
- Are you the family of Edwin Hoover?
- Yes.

615
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:45,820
l'm sorry. We did everything we could.

616
00:52:47,079 --> 00:52:50,579
He was... Well, it was too much.

617
00:52:52,659 --> 00:52:56,710
He probably just fell asleep
and never woke up.

618
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:03,590
l'll have someone come and talk to you
about handling the remains.

619
00:53:06,090 --> 00:53:08,179
Thank you.

620
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:18,519
Linda!

621
00:53:24,989 --> 00:53:27,110
Mom?

622
00:53:27,199 --> 00:53:32,199
- ls Grandpa dead?
- Yeah, honey. He passed away.

623
00:53:51,059 --> 00:53:52,679
Hi.

624
00:53:53,269 --> 00:53:56,940
l'm your bereavement liaison, Linda.

625
00:53:59,650 --> 00:54:02,980
- My consolations for your loss.
- Thank you.

626
00:54:03,070 --> 00:54:06,570
OK, these are the forms you need to fill out.

627
00:54:06,659 --> 00:54:08,860
Death certificate.

628
00:54:08,949 --> 00:54:10,949
A report of the death.

629
00:54:11,030 --> 00:54:16,369
An ME pink slip.
Please try and be as detailed as possible.

630
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:20,420
This is a brochure
for our grief recovery support group,

631
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:23,590
and if you like l can refer you
to a funeral home

632
00:54:23,670 --> 00:54:25,840
so you can begin making arrangements.

633
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:31,679
Actually, pre-arrangements
have already been made in Albuquerque.

634
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:34,719
- Albuquerque?
- We're on our way to California.

635
00:54:34,809 --> 00:54:39,230
lf the body is crossing state lines,
you'll need a burial transit permit.

636
00:54:39,309 --> 00:54:43,070
OK. But we're trying to get
to Redondo Beach by three o'clock.

637
00:54:43,150 --> 00:54:47,239
Three o'clock today? Huh.
Ain't gonna happen.

638
00:54:49,530 --> 00:54:55,239
OK. Can l just...?
l know that this might be a little unusual,

639
00:54:55,329 --> 00:54:58,909
but if maybe we could just go,
and then we'll come back

640
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,329
and take care of all the paperwork, and...

641
00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:06,210
- No. You can't just abandon the body.
- No, no. Nobody's gonna abandon the body.

642
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:09,380
- The hospital becomes responsible.
- We'll go, and come back.

643
00:55:09,469 --> 00:55:12,050
- Sir, we have ways of...
- You're not following me.

644
00:55:12,139 --> 00:55:17,929
Sir, you are not the only one that's had
somebody die here today, OK?

645
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:27,530
ls there any way
we might be able to view the remains?

646
00:55:32,449 --> 00:55:36,489
We haven't had a chance
to move him downstairs.

647
00:55:36,579 --> 00:55:40,909
So someone may come in in a few minutes
to take him to the basement.

648
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:45,750
- Tell them who you are, and they will wait.
- Thank you.

649
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:49,090
When you're done with the paperwork,
l'll be at the nurses' station.

650
00:55:49,170 --> 00:55:52,510
- Great. Thank you, Linda.
- Thank you.

651
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:32,260
Goddammit, Dad.

652
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:34,219
Goddammit.

653
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:37,349
Stupid...

654
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:50,650
We'll go to Little Miss Sunshine
next year, OK, honey?

655
00:56:50,739 --> 00:56:52,860
Next year.

656
00:57:00,199 --> 00:57:02,909
No. No.

657
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:08,380
We've come 700 miles. l'll be damned
if l'm not making that contest, Sheryl.

658
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:12,130
Well, Richard, we can't leave him here.

659
00:57:14,179 --> 00:57:16,639
We're not gonna leave him.

660
00:57:17,679 --> 00:57:19,889
Richard, what are you doing?

661
00:57:19,969 --> 00:57:21,469
Fuck!

662
00:57:27,019 --> 00:57:29,610
- Dwayne, go around outside.
- What are you thinking?

663
00:57:29,690 --> 00:57:32,440
- We're gonna take him with us.
- No, that is not happening.

664
00:57:32,530 --> 00:57:36,699
He's better off with us than these people.
Go round underneath this window.

665
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:39,070
- Frank, you go with him.
- Dwayne, don't move.

666
00:57:39,159 --> 00:57:42,329
You stay here. We'll take Olive.
Frank can drive.

667
00:57:42,409 --> 00:57:47,039
We'll be there in two hours. Listen to me.
l'll call a funeral home once we get there.

668
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:52,300
One thing my father would have wanted
is to see Olive perform in this pageant.

669
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:56,179
l believe we'd be doing
a grave disservice to his memory

670
00:57:56,260 --> 00:57:59,010
if we were to just give up now, all right?

671
00:57:59,099 --> 00:58:03,639
There's two kinds of people in this world.
There's winners, and there's losers.

672
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:07,389
You know what the difference is?
Winners don't give up.

673
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:11,190
So what are we here?
Are we winners, or are we losers?

674
00:58:13,190 --> 00:58:14,360
OK. OK.

675
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:16,739
Let's do it.

676
00:58:16,820 --> 00:58:21,030
You guys go. Olive, you watch the curtain.

677
00:58:24,869 --> 00:58:28,750
l don't know. l have no reason
to assume it's gonna be otherwise.

678
00:58:28,829 --> 00:58:31,710
Watch. Get the back, get the back.

679
00:58:31,789 --> 00:58:34,090
Go, go, go.

680
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:37,840
Yeah, five o'clock.

681
00:58:41,889 --> 00:58:45,769
Now, he's very heavy. Be gentle.

682
00:58:46,730 --> 00:58:49,230
- One, two...
- OK.

683
00:58:49,309 --> 00:58:50,650
Three.

684
00:58:50,730 --> 00:58:54,269
Wait, wait, wait. Not yet, not yet.

685
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:56,440
OK. Go. Go, go, go.

686
00:58:57,110 --> 00:58:58,449
OK.

687
00:58:58,949 --> 00:59:02,989
- His knee's...
- l've got him. Come on.

688
00:59:03,079 --> 00:59:05,119
Daddy. Daddy, hurry up.

689
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:11,960
You got him? OK, he's slipping.

690
00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:20,550
l got him, l got him, l got him.

691
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:24,559
Be careful.

692
00:59:29,889 --> 00:59:32,349
Hurry up!

693
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:34,190
Keep watch, Olive.

694
00:59:35,070 --> 00:59:38,610
Watch it. Watch the kerb, watch the kerb.

695
00:59:44,449 --> 00:59:46,579
Watch his head! Watch it!

696
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:49,829
Keys?

697
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:57,960
- Swing him round this way.
- Olive, get in.

698
00:59:58,050 --> 01:00:00,130
OK, let's go.

699
01:00:04,510 --> 01:00:06,760
- Let's go, Frank.
- Did l mention

700
01:00:06,849 --> 01:00:11,690
that l am the pre-eminent
Proust scholar in the US?

701
01:00:11,769 --> 01:00:16,059
- Here we go. Here we go.
- Are you OK?

702
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:25,909
- Dad?
- Yeah, honey?

703
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,289
What's gonna happen to Grandpa?

704
01:00:54,019 --> 01:00:56,309
Uncle Frank?

705
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,480
Yeah?

706
01:01:00,110 --> 01:01:02,900
Do you think there's a heaven?

707
01:01:04,409 --> 01:01:09,280
lt's hard to say, Olive.
l don't think anyone knows for sure.

708
01:01:09,369 --> 01:01:12,409
l know, but what do you think?

709
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:19,000
- Well...
- l think there is one.

710
01:01:20,590 --> 01:01:23,420
- Do you think l'll get in?
- Yes.

711
01:01:23,510 --> 01:01:25,800
- You promise?
- Yes.

712
01:01:41,230 --> 01:01:43,030
- Son of a bitch!
- What happened?

713
01:01:43,110 --> 01:01:45,110
He cut me off.

714
01:01:49,989 --> 01:01:53,949
- OK, just leave it.
- lt's stuck or something.

715
01:01:54,039 --> 01:01:58,630
- Maybe try pulling it from here.
- No, no. Just leave it.

716
01:01:58,710 --> 01:02:01,960
- l'll fix it when we get there.
- OK, fine.

717
01:02:02,050 --> 01:02:04,130
Dammit!

718
01:02:08,090 --> 01:02:09,389
Oh, Jesus!

719
01:02:09,469 --> 01:02:12,849
God! l'm being pulled over.

720
01:02:12,929 --> 01:02:13,969
Here we go.

721
01:02:15,349 --> 01:02:19,599
OK. Everybody just pretend
to be normal, OK?

722
01:02:20,269 --> 01:02:23,610
Like everything's normal here.

723
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:37,789
How you folks doing?

724
01:02:37,869 --> 01:02:40,829
Yeah, we're fine. Just...

725
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:44,050
- Little trouble with the horn?
- What?

726
01:02:44,130 --> 01:02:48,679
- Having a little trouble with your horn?
- Yeah.

727
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:50,469
A little trouble. Sorry.

728
01:02:51,510 --> 01:02:55,309
- Sorry.
- Could you step outside the vehicle?

729
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:06,650
- Step this way, please.
- No, no.

730
01:03:06,739 --> 01:03:09,320
- What?
- Don't.

731
01:03:09,409 --> 01:03:11,659
Don't what?

732
01:03:14,239 --> 01:03:18,329
- Do you have something in your trunk, sir?
- lt's nothing. l... Don't open it.

733
01:03:18,409 --> 01:03:21,920
Sir, you just gave me
probable cause to search your trunk.

734
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:25,210
- Sir, put your hands on the vehicle, now!
- l just...

735
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:27,590
- Don't move!
- OK.

736
01:03:30,719 --> 01:03:36,219
- lt's not illegal!
- l'd advise you to keep your mouth shut!

737
01:03:36,309 --> 01:03:39,269
Oh, God. What is he doing?

738
01:03:45,150 --> 01:03:49,820
- lt's not illegal.
- Goddamn!

739
01:03:54,030 --> 01:03:56,619
Sir, could you come back here?

740
01:04:05,130 --> 01:04:07,960
l love this stuff. l love it.

741
01:04:08,050 --> 01:04:11,090
God bless you, God bless you.

742
01:04:11,179 --> 01:04:15,179
- Don't worry, l'm not gonna bust you.
- Thank you.

743
01:04:16,349 --> 01:04:19,019
How you doing?

744
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:23,349
- Cute. Cute family. That's nice.
- Thank you.

745
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:27,230
And this on the side.
Little of this, little of that.

746
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:31,280
- Sweet sweetness.
- That is sweet, yeah.

747
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:34,869
- And dirty.
- And this one is one of my favourites.

748
01:04:34,949 --> 01:04:37,030
Ah, good. Yeah.

749
01:04:38,579 --> 01:04:42,159
That's a little different choice.

750
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:45,960
No?

751
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:50,210
- l'll leave that with you.
- All right.

752
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:53,679
- You have a good day there.
- Yeah.

753
01:05:04,309 --> 01:05:06,900
What happened?

754
01:05:06,980 --> 01:05:10,570
l'll tell you when l regain consciousness.

755
01:05:12,820 --> 01:05:16,320
Frank, Dwayne, get out and push.

756
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:36,929
OK, there it is. Redondo Beach, 46.

757
01:05:37,010 --> 01:05:39,389
lt's 2:15. Might be a few minutes late.

758
01:05:39,469 --> 01:05:43,639
They said three o'clock sharp.
We can't cross these people. Trust me.

759
01:05:43,730 --> 01:05:47,309
- Mom, Dwayne has 20/20 vision.
- l bet he does.

760
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:50,730
OK. Now l'm gonna check
to see if you're colour-blind.

761
01:05:50,820 --> 01:05:53,739
Asshole!

762
01:05:53,820 --> 01:05:57,070
What's the letter in the circle?

763
01:05:59,329 --> 01:06:02,239
No, no, no. lnside the circle.

764
01:06:02,329 --> 01:06:04,619
Right there. See?

765
01:06:05,460 --> 01:06:08,500
lt's an "A". Can't you see it? Right there.

766
01:06:11,340 --> 01:06:13,710
lt's bright green.

767
01:06:16,969 --> 01:06:18,219
Oh, man.

768
01:06:26,639 --> 01:06:31,150
Dwayne, l think you might be colour-blind.

769
01:06:40,239 --> 01:06:44,039
You can't fly jets if you're colour-blind.

770
01:06:55,550 --> 01:07:00,679
We've got a little bit of...
OK, we've got an emergency back here.

771
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:04,760
- What is it? What's the emergency?
- Just pull over!

772
01:07:04,849 --> 01:07:07,769
lt's all right, man.
Dwayne, Dwayne. lt's all right.

773
01:07:07,849 --> 01:07:11,349
- Just pull over the car! l'm not kidding!
- All right!

774
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:15,530
- Get him to pull over, please?
- Richard, pull over! Pull over the car!

775
01:07:15,610 --> 01:07:18,860
- We're pulling over.
- l'm pulling over.

776
01:07:18,949 --> 01:07:21,739
Please! No, no, no.
Dwayne! Dwayne! Sit down!

777
01:07:21,820 --> 01:07:24,659
God, this better be good!
l'm pulling over.

778
01:07:24,739 --> 01:07:26,829
- All right!
- Stop the car!

779
01:07:26,909 --> 01:07:32,829
- lt's gonna be OK , Dwayne.
- Do not open the door when we're stopping!

780
01:07:35,250 --> 01:07:37,340
Fuck!

781
01:07:42,050 --> 01:07:44,889
- What happened?
- He's colour-blind. He can't fly.

782
01:07:46,019 --> 01:07:48,809
Oh, Jesus. Oh, no.

783
01:07:53,019 --> 01:07:56,150
Just give him a second.

784
01:08:18,050 --> 01:08:20,130
Dwayne?

785
01:08:22,890 --> 01:08:25,390
Dwayne, honey, l'm sorry.

786
01:08:31,939 --> 01:08:35,979
- Dwayne, come on. We have to go.
- l'm not going.

787
01:08:38,279 --> 01:08:41,029
- Dwayne...
- l said l'm not.

788
01:08:41,109 --> 01:08:45,369
OK? l don't care.
l'm not getting on that bus again!

789
01:08:45,449 --> 01:08:47,829
Dwayne, for better or worse,
we're your family.

790
01:08:47,909 --> 01:08:49,659
You're not my family! OK?

791
01:08:49,750 --> 01:08:55,920
l don't wanna be your family!
l hate you fucking people! l hate you!

792
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:59,460
Divorce? Bankrupt? Suicide?

793
01:08:59,550 --> 01:09:03,380
You're fucking losers! You're losers!

794
01:09:05,970 --> 01:09:11,680
No. Please just leave me here, Mom.
OK? Please, please, please.

795
01:09:14,649 --> 01:09:16,939
Please just leave me here.

796
01:09:27,989 --> 01:09:30,159
Shit.

797
01:09:32,909 --> 01:09:35,079
l don't know what to do.

798
01:09:35,789 --> 01:09:41,130
Well, it's getting late. Maybe...
Can somebody stay here with him?

799
01:09:41,210 --> 01:09:44,380
- l'll stay.
- That is not happening.

800
01:09:47,140 --> 01:09:49,510
All right. Well...

801
01:09:52,350 --> 01:09:54,850
Just worried about the time.

802
01:09:57,479 --> 01:10:02,399
Olive? Do you wanna try talking to him?

803
01:10:02,479 --> 01:10:05,739
Richard, there is nothing to say.
We just have to wait.

804
01:10:05,819 --> 01:10:07,909
Honey...

805
01:10:57,369 --> 01:10:59,460
OK.

806
01:11:01,210 --> 01:11:03,500
Then let's go.

807
01:11:34,029 --> 01:11:37,250
l apologise for the things l said.

808
01:11:38,159 --> 01:11:41,789
l was upset, and l didn't really mean them.

809
01:11:44,090 --> 01:11:45,880
lt's OK. Come on.

810
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:48,260
Let's go.

811
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:56,760
- 2:55.
- Right, everybody look for the exit, OK?

812
01:11:59,810 --> 01:12:04,560
- Here! Here's the turn-off. Turn in here.
- Does anybody see the Redondo Suites?

813
01:12:04,649 --> 01:12:07,279
There! There's the hotel!
Little Miss Sunshine!

814
01:12:07,359 --> 01:12:12,359
There it is. Olive, we're gonna make it.
We're gonna make it.

815
01:12:14,239 --> 01:12:16,989
How the hell do you get over there?
Sheryl?

816
01:12:17,079 --> 01:12:21,329
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
- No! No! You're passing it!

817
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:24,250
- You've gotta turn round.
- You drove past it!

818
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:26,880
- You've gotta turn round!
- lt's back there!

819
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:29,510
l can't turn around.
Does anybody see a way back?

820
01:12:29,590 --> 01:12:32,680
lt's a one-way street!

821
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:36,930
- We've got parking lots on the right.
- Put your seat belt on, baby.

822
01:12:37,010 --> 01:12:40,100
- What are you doing?
- l can't slow down. l can't.

823
01:12:41,310 --> 01:12:44,149
- What time is it, Frank?
- 2:59.

824
01:12:44,229 --> 01:12:47,649
- Dad!
- lt's a straight shot from here. We'll make it.

825
01:12:47,729 --> 01:12:51,189
- Oh, it's a dead end!
- l'm not going back!

826
01:12:51,279 --> 01:12:55,909
That is a one-way road. That will take us
all the way back to the freeway!

827
01:12:55,989 --> 01:12:59,699
You're the one who told me
to go left back there!

828
01:12:59,789 --> 01:13:02,289
l'm not turning back!

829
01:13:02,369 --> 01:13:04,460
Richard!

830
01:13:07,340 --> 01:13:11,300
- What are you doing? You can't do this.
- God, Richard!

831
01:13:11,380 --> 01:13:13,720
- OK, here's the hotel.
- OK.

832
01:13:14,930 --> 01:13:18,430
- Where's the entrance?
- Right here. Right here.

833
01:13:18,510 --> 01:13:22,060
- You're passing it.
- Hold on!

834
01:13:23,310 --> 01:13:26,649
Here we go. One more time. Little bump.

835
01:13:31,489 --> 01:13:33,739
Come on!

836
01:14:14,029 --> 01:14:18,109
- Hello? Hi, we'd like to register.
- Sorry. We're closed.

837
01:14:18,199 --> 01:14:21,449
No, we have the entrant right here.
We just wanna check in.

838
01:14:21,539 --> 01:14:25,119
- Registration ended at three.
- lt's three o'clock now.

839
01:14:25,210 --> 01:14:28,750
- No...
- Have a heart. We're four minutes late.

840
01:14:28,829 --> 01:14:32,840
- We drove all the way from Albuquerque.
- You should have been here by three.

841
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:37,510
- There must be a way we can work this out.
- Everybody else was here before three.

842
01:14:37,590 --> 01:14:40,970
- l'd be giving unfair advantage.
- We're not looking for an advantage.

843
01:14:41,050 --> 01:14:43,600
- We just want her to compete.
- Don't yell at me, sir.

844
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:48,270
l didn't make you late. We've settled on
a schedule, we've turned off the computers.

845
01:14:48,350 --> 01:14:51,810
Our line-up is final,
and l have a hair check to do

846
01:14:51,899 --> 01:14:56,239
l'm sorry that you're late, but l can't help you.

847
01:14:57,529 --> 01:15:01,739
Please.
You don't know what we've been through.

848
01:15:06,579 --> 01:15:11,000
Ms Jenkins?
l can put 'em in the system.

849
01:15:11,079 --> 01:15:15,670
- Oh, Kirby, you don't have to.
- No, it's OK. lt's five minutes.

850
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:19,050
Well, it's your time. Excuse me.

851
01:15:19,130 --> 01:15:23,100
- Thank you, Kirby. Thank you very much.
- You don't know what this means.

852
01:15:23,180 --> 01:15:25,770
Please. lt's only five minutes.

853
01:15:25,850 --> 01:15:30,600
l'm not working for these people next year.
These people are crazy.

854
01:15:30,689 --> 01:15:33,270
- So, what's your name?
- Olive.

855
01:15:33,359 --> 01:15:37,399
Olive. That's a nice name.
Are you the dad?

856
01:15:37,489 --> 01:15:41,659
- lt's Miss California. lt's really her.
- Do you wanna go and say hi?

857
01:15:46,199 --> 01:15:47,750
Thank you.

858
01:15:48,789 --> 01:15:51,960
- Hi. What's your name?
- Olive.

859
01:15:52,039 --> 01:15:55,670
- What's your talent, Olive?
- l like dancing.

860
01:15:55,750 --> 01:15:58,380
Dancing was too hard for me.
l'm a singer.

861
01:15:58,470 --> 01:16:02,840
- You must be a good dancer.
- l am. l'm really good.

862
01:16:02,930 --> 01:16:07,100
l bet you are.
Well, thanks for stopping by, Olive.

863
01:16:07,180 --> 01:16:09,270
Best of luck.

864
01:16:11,810 --> 01:16:16,729
- Miss California? Do you eat ice cream?
- l love ice cream.

865
01:16:16,819 --> 01:16:20,149
My favourite flavour
is Chocolate Cherry Garcia,

866
01:16:20,239 --> 01:16:24,909
although technically,
l think that's a frozen yoghurt. OK?

867
01:16:24,989 --> 01:16:26,829
OK. Thanks.

868
01:16:26,909 --> 01:16:29,000
- Bye.
- Bye.

869
01:16:30,460 --> 01:16:33,789
- Mom! She eats ice cream.
- l heard.

870
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:39,800
The packet has tickets in it,
and your badge number.

871
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:42,050
- ls there anything else?
- Yeah.

872
01:16:42,130 --> 01:16:45,260
ls there a funeral home around here?

873
01:17:04,199 --> 01:17:08,199
OK, let's get your swimsuit on.
You wanna get changed behind the curtain?

874
01:17:08,289 --> 01:17:14,539
This is the last touch-up, everybody.
Final touch-ups. Last touch-up.

875
01:17:43,239 --> 01:17:46,699
- OK, wait.
- l will wait for you!

876
01:17:48,369 --> 01:17:50,869
Let's get outta here.

877
01:17:55,710 --> 01:17:58,210
Olive Hoover?

878
01:17:58,289 --> 01:18:00,090
l need your music.

879
01:18:00,170 --> 01:18:02,250
- Music. Right.
- Yeah.

880
01:18:10,060 --> 01:18:12,720
- Here you go.
- This?

881
01:18:12,810 --> 01:18:15,600
- Did you choose this?
- No, my grandpa did.

882
01:18:15,689 --> 01:18:17,310
Your grandpa?

883
01:18:17,399 --> 01:18:19,439
- Which track?
- 12.

884
01:18:20,069 --> 01:18:24,239
We're driving five, six hours...
Thought he was napping.

885
01:18:24,319 --> 01:18:28,949
By the time we figured it out,
it was, you know...

886
01:18:29,029 --> 01:18:31,619
Too late.

887
01:18:31,699 --> 01:18:34,289
So, where's the body?

888
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:54,010
- Personal effects.
- Thank you.

889
01:18:54,100 --> 01:18:56,229
You take care.

890
01:18:57,270 --> 01:18:59,350
You too.

891
01:19:35,430 --> 01:19:42,399
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to
the 24th annual Little Miss Sunshine pageant!

892
01:19:45,029 --> 01:19:49,609
Yes! Now, please put your hands
together once again,

893
01:19:49,699 --> 01:19:54,699
and help me welcome to the stage
our 12 beautiful contestants!

894
01:21:16,279 --> 01:21:21,289
Let's have a big round of applause
for our lovely contestants!

895
01:21:22,710 --> 01:21:29,710
At the end of the evening, one of these girls
will be crowned Little Miss Sunshine!

896
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:43,020
- Olive, honey? Are you OK in there?
- Yeah, l'm fine.

897
01:21:49,479 --> 01:21:50,689
What?

898
01:21:50,779 --> 01:21:52,939
You got a kid in the show?

899
01:21:53,989 --> 01:21:55,989
First time?

900
01:21:56,069 --> 01:21:58,159
Yeah. Yeah.

901
01:22:46,670 --> 01:22:50,079
America! lt's so beautiful.

902
01:22:54,420 --> 01:22:58,590
Sometimes l just wish
l could go to sleep till l was 18,

903
01:22:59,930 --> 01:23:06,020
and skip all this crap, high school
and everything. Just skip it.

904
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:10,100
- You know Marcel Proust?
- He's the guy you teach.

905
01:23:10,189 --> 01:23:12,609
Yeah. French writer.

906
01:23:12,689 --> 01:23:14,819
Total loser.

907
01:23:15,529 --> 01:23:20,199
Never had a real job.
Unrequited love affairs. Gay.

908
01:23:20,279 --> 01:23:23,369
Spent 20 years writing a book
almost no one reads,

909
01:23:23,449 --> 01:23:28,119
but he's also probably the greatest writer
since Shakespeare. Anyway, he...

910
01:23:28,210 --> 01:23:31,829
he gets down to the end of his life,
and he looks back and decides

911
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:35,500
that all those years he suffered,
those were the best years of his life,

912
01:23:35,590 --> 01:23:37,720
cos they made him who he was.

913
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:42,800
All the years he was happy, you know,
total waste. Didn't learn a thing.

914
01:23:42,890 --> 01:23:45,850
So, if you sleep until you're 18...

915
01:23:47,060 --> 01:23:49,479
Think of the suffering you're gonna miss.

916
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:53,149
l mean, high school?
Those are your prime suffering years.

917
01:23:53,229 --> 01:23:56,859
You don't get better suffering than that.

918
01:23:59,779 --> 01:24:02,069
You know what?

919
01:24:03,319 --> 01:24:05,909
l mean, fuck beauty contests.

920
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:10,210
Life is one fucking beauty contest
after another:

921
01:24:10,289 --> 01:24:13,789
you know, school, then college, then work.

922
01:24:13,880 --> 01:24:18,130
Fuck that. And fuck the Air Force Academy.

923
01:24:18,210 --> 01:24:21,880
lf l wanna fly, l'll find a way to fly.

924
01:24:21,970 --> 01:24:25,930
l mean, you do what you love,
and fuck the rest.

925
01:24:31,140 --> 01:24:34,560
l'm glad you're talking again, Dwayne.

926
01:24:35,859 --> 01:24:39,279
You're not nearly as stupid as you look.

927
01:24:46,279 --> 01:24:49,289
- Wanna go back?
- Not really.

928
01:24:52,750 --> 01:24:55,039
Yeah, we should go back.

929
01:24:57,300 --> 01:25:02,970
And now, the moment we've all been
waiting for: the talent competition.

930
01:25:14,270 --> 01:25:16,270
Miss Carly Nugent!

931
01:25:47,680 --> 01:25:50,560
Yodel-ay-hee-hoo, that was great!

932
01:26:09,159 --> 01:26:12,079
Wow! Funkylicious!

933
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:39,520
- l'm going backstage.
- Yeah. Right. See you.

934
01:26:41,770 --> 01:26:43,819
Oh, look at you.

935
01:26:43,899 --> 01:26:46,609
ls that your costume?

936
01:26:49,119 --> 01:26:51,239
OK, here.

937
01:26:52,619 --> 01:26:56,460
- What's going on?
- l just came to wish Olive good luck.

938
01:26:56,539 --> 01:26:58,920
- How are you doing, honey?
- Good.

939
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:02,590
- Nervous.
- Yeah. You're gonna do great. l just know it.

940
01:27:02,670 --> 01:27:05,880
- Can l talk to you for a second?
- Yeah.

941
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:09,010
What's up?

942
01:27:11,510 --> 01:27:13,430
l don't want her to go on.

943
01:27:16,310 --> 01:27:20,100
- Are you authorised to be backstage?
- No. Where are the dressing rooms?

944
01:27:20,189 --> 01:27:23,939
- Are you allowed to be here?
- Just tell me where the dressing rooms are.

945
01:27:24,359 --> 01:27:29,199
- Listen, we're not in Albuquerque any more.
- How are you feeling?

946
01:27:29,279 --> 01:27:31,739
- Better. Where's Olive?
- Just there. What's up?

947
01:27:31,819 --> 01:27:34,789
- Mom, l don't want Olive doing this.
- Oh, my God.

948
01:27:34,869 --> 01:27:38,210
- Look around. Mom, this place is fucked!
- He's right!

949
01:27:38,289 --> 01:27:42,130
Look, l don't want these people
judging Olive. Fuck them!

950
01:27:42,210 --> 01:27:44,710
- lt is too late.
- lt's not. You're the mom,

951
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:47,460
and you're supposed to protect her.

952
01:27:47,550 --> 01:27:52,640
Everyone is gonna laugh at her, Mom.
Please don't let her do this.

953
01:27:52,720 --> 01:27:55,560
Olive Hoover, two minutes.

954
01:27:55,640 --> 01:27:58,680
Look, she's not a beauty queen.

955
01:27:58,770 --> 01:28:01,479
She's just not. l'm gonna tell her.

956
01:28:01,560 --> 01:28:06,020
No, you listen to me. Olive is who she is.
She has worked so hard,

957
01:28:06,109 --> 01:28:11,409
she's poured everything into this.
We can't just take it away from her. We can't.

958
01:28:11,489 --> 01:28:17,909
l know you want to protect her, l know, honey.
But we've gotta let Olive be Olive.

959
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,909
Olive Hoover! Are you the family?

960
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,250
OK?

961
01:28:23,329 --> 01:28:25,710
Olive, it's time. Are you OK?

962
01:28:26,750 --> 01:28:28,880
- Yeah.
- We've gotta go.

963
01:28:28,970 --> 01:28:31,050
- Now.
- Hang on.

964
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:33,890
Olive, look at me.

965
01:28:34,930 --> 01:28:37,850
lf you don't wanna do this, that's OK.

966
01:28:37,930 --> 01:28:40,930
lf you wanna sit this one out,
it's totally fine by us.

967
01:28:41,020 --> 01:28:44,560
- We're proud of you anyway.
- We gotta go.

968
01:28:48,819 --> 01:28:50,899
lt's time!

969
01:28:59,369 --> 01:29:01,460
Ready? Let's go.

970
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:15,010
Good luck, honey.

971
01:29:15,090 --> 01:29:19,970
Copy that. 25 is performance-ready,
and we're walking.

972
01:29:20,930 --> 01:29:22,020
As fast as we can.

973
01:29:25,689 --> 01:29:28,609
- ls she going on?
- She's going on.

974
01:29:31,859 --> 01:29:36,949
Pure fairy-tale magic!
Miss Charisma Whiteman!

975
01:29:37,029 --> 01:29:39,159
Wasn't that a stardust fantasy?

976
01:29:39,489 --> 01:29:40,449
Thank you for that.

977
01:29:40,539 --> 01:29:44,289
You have been such a patient audience.
We have one more contestant,

978
01:29:44,369 --> 01:29:46,460
and then we'll be crowning our winner.

979
01:29:46,539 --> 01:29:52,920
Please give a warm welcome
to Miss Olive Hoover!

980
01:30:07,399 --> 01:30:09,310
ls everything OK?
