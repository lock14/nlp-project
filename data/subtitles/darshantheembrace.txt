some describe it so,
others hear of it so,
but no one truly knows it.

We take refuge at the guru's feet
We take refuge
with Amritanandamayi (Amma)
We take refuge at the guru's feet
We take refuge with Amrita (Amma)
Give her water. Not this.
Why are you giving her this?
It's a bad habit.
It's bad for her health.
Give her green leaves,
not sweet things.
Chew it!
Stop these bad habits.
The first time I met Amma
was in Paris.
I went because I'd heard about it
the week before.
When I arrived in the hall
with lots of people in white,
chanting,
and the books of her teachings,
I was a little afraid.
I wondered where I was,
who these people were.
And then...
I saw Indian families, with children,
and that reassured me.
I thought to myself,
"If there are Indians,
it means this is something traditional."
Then I saw children in Amma's arms,
their reaction
and her reaction to them,
and that put my mind at rest.
So I said to myself,
"She won't bite. Go for it!"
I went up and I was very moved.
But I didn't really understand.
I sat for a while then went home.
I didn't know I was supposed to stay.
I saw Amma again a few months later
when she returned.
For a while afterwards,
I sometimes had doubts.
I was scared.
Of the whole image thing,
the teacher, the people...
But I realised this entailed work.
Work regarding my upbringing
and what I had previously learnt.
I now have total peace of mind.
Having known Amma for a few years,
I am convinced,
from being close to her
and seeing her work,
of the purity of her intentions.
She is the irrefutable proof
that love truly exists.
Pure, unselfish, total,
infinite love.
Raise your hands
if you are without.
I have an announcement
about September 21.
- The buildings in New York...
- You mean September 11.
Listen to Amma first.
You know they were destroyed.
And now there are problems in Russia.
So for world peace,
phone and tell
your acquaintances...
It's 12 noon, right?
Tell them in e-mails,
on websites,
that for one minute,
people in shops,
in bathrooms, in bed,
in buses, wherever,
should pray for world peace.
I can't talk any louder,
I'm getting old.
All our branches should do that.
You should send out e-mails.
What is it?
I don't want it.
Like in Russia recently...
Terrorists are killing people
every day.
Even little children.
This is increasing.
The future looks bleak.
It's very dangerous,
so we must all pray.
We may not achieve peace,
but we shall pray for it.
In Russia it was a school.
Last week it was a school.
So let's pray.
We're heading
in the wrong direction.
We are going into the abyss.
Only divine grace can help us.
We shall pray.
Show us mercy.
One of the interesting things
about her is,
because of her love of all beings
Amma used to give her food away
to the birds and the animals.
She ate very little.
That's how she is.
The birds flew away when they saw us,
but came back when they saw Amma.
She used to meditate a lot.
Often, when we saw her like this,
we'd shake her,
but she wouldn't move.
Later, she would come in laughing.
The next morning,
in meditation,
she'd burst out crying and laughing.
We wondered if she had gone mental.
But a monk told us not to disturb her,
that she was in the ultimate
transcendental state: Bhava Samadhi.
Are you happy?
I'm happy because I have you.
How come you speak Malayalam?
Do you speak to people here
in Malayalam?
They told me,
"This is for Amma.
"Amma gives fruit as an offering.
"She'll give you sweets
as an offering,
"Amma gives everything."
They told me all that.
I learnt it by heart in Malayalam
so I could say it to Amma.
You got the offering?
You got it as they told you.
How many languages do you speak?
Five or six.
Which ones?
Kannada, Hindi, Tamil,
Telugu, Malayalam...
- English?
- English!
I realised early on
that there is an unchanged truth
for the changing universe.
Where I grew up as a child,
there were about 60 small houses.
I'd collect leftovers there.
In the evenings
I saw children of some families
lying around, tired and starving
while those of other families ate.
I also saw old people crying,
with no one to care for them,
wash their clothes or love them.
When I came face to face
with this life,
I wanted to die in fire, in pain.
Why was it like this? Was it their fate?
If someone falls into a pit
it's God's duty to help them.
That makes it my duty too.
That's how I began.
Let's pray that all sorrows
be removed from the world
and let out a sustained cry...
The poor girl's stiff from standing.
Everyone will have their turn.
I know you don't have
the energy to stand.
I thought I'd see you all,
even if I suffer.
But I don't have time
to give you Darshan or food.
Too many are here.
Fridays are like that.
I decided to give Darshan
on Fridays, food on Tuesdays,
but there are always too many people.
She's four
and hasn't started writing yet.
She'll start in her own time.
Mother, the house plans...
I saw them, I saw them.
Are they beautiful?
Are they enough, Mother?
You're a handsome boy!
It's enough that women
are attracted to you, not the house.
Who knows,
he may already have a love.
My child, my child...
There's no problem.
The pus will come out and it will dry.
Let it dry out.
My child...
Take some lemon rind and dry it.
- Won't they get upset?
- No. I asked them in advance.
Is it nice to ask?
Mother, I only told
thirty people that I know,
but they all wanted
to see you for Darshan.
My child, my child...
We'll give them food here.
Amma, I want to hug you.
He studies well,
but I'm afraid he's in love.
I'll retry in May.
If you quit that job,
what will you do?
Study hard, my child.
I want to open a shop.
Be careful.
She's trying to touch the elephant.
You've gained weight, haven't you?
Where's your father?
I put such problems in each episode.
- This one's...
- A waste. An utter waste.
What's "Amma Malayalam"?
Interviews with literary people.
I saw one with Prof. Bashkaran,
but just an interview.
If you had his songs in between,
it could be livelier.
You could insert his film songs.
- Like the first two lines?
- For example.
- This is good.
- Who's Mohan Nair?
He made Randu Penkuttikal,
Salini ente koottukaari...
Very good, positive stories.
People will be moved to tears.
Which way do we go?
I'll show you.
In Hinduism, creator and creation
are no different.
The creator is creation.
It's divine power that we see
in different forms.
The sea and the waves
are not different.
Waves originate from the sea.
When a sculptor sees a stone,
he sees a statue in his mind,
not a stone.
A bee sees honey, not the flower.
Thus I see the divine in everyone
and love and help them.
In my ears,
I hear the cries
of thousands of needy and poor.
But when I serve people,
I have no special experiences.
Nothing particular happens.
My mind is like butter
floating on water.
However I remain here
in this world,
my mind in my own hands.
"You have the right to act
but not to the fruit of action.
"Never make the fruit of action
your motive.
"Remain even-minded
in success and failure.
"Those whose motive is
the fruit of action deserve pity."
We were short of people
to wipe the women's faces.
Because we're asked to wipe faces
with too much sweat or make-up.
I arrived around 8 am,
thinking I'd stay a couple of hours.
But in fact, I was there
from 8 am to 4.30 pm,
when the Darshan finished.
I stood very close to Amma.
I wiped the faces
of women and children
during all that time.
Thousands of faces.
I had a very deep
emotional experience.
I was immerged
in that state of compassion and love.
In a flood of love.
My watch was moving
at an incredible pace.
Time ceased to exist.
Oh my! I thought you were singing
in the Calcutta language!
Lead us from the unreal to the real
From darkness to light
From death to immortality
Om... peace, peace, peace
Om... May all beings find happiness
We pay tribute to the guru
True gurus live for their disciples.
They're patient to forgive
their disciples' weaknesses
and enlighten them.
They expect nothing
from their disciples.
These are true gurus.
But now, disciples merely copy them.
They seek to become like them.
This can give gurus a bad name.
Gurus teach about the art of living.
Because there are two types
of education:
"Living", meaning your job,
and "life" which the gurus teach.
In the materialistic world,
teachers teach practical things.
In the spiritual world,
some things aren't clear.
Why are two spoons of tonic good
but a whole bottle dangerous?
Even if you travel with a map
bandits can still rob you.
Going to the moon
and learning about it are different.
I think we can stop there.
I don't want to discuss
the guru/disciple relationship
as people have differing views.
Say you go to a library
and pick out two books,
if they are both bad,
it doesn't mean
all the books there are bad.
But this is how people are now.
This is why I won't discuss it.
People ask why we die
despite the existence
of the supreme soul.
Death is only the failure
of the medium: The body.
The medium, or body,
is not strong.
In writing, we end a sentence
with a full stop
before starting the next one.
Death is like that full stop.
It doesn't mean an end.
We just go on to the next thing.
If one knows this principle,
then death is a joy.
It is a blissful experience,
like jumping into a pool.
We merely move on
to the next stage.
People say the River Ganges
is pure and divine.
Many mahatmas
have lived in Benares.
It's a divine place.
The mahatmas built
many temples there.
These great souls are like
transformers transmitting power.
If you go near a perfume factory,
you'll smell of that perfume.
So there's a good atmosphere.
Many people come here
with that belief in order to pray.
So naturally,
it becomes a place of grandeur,
with all these people
in concentrated prayer.
Concentrated prayer
certainly creates a power.
Like in Italy,
where St Francis of Assisi
prayed and died.
Many people go there to pray.
Benares is like that.
Many ascetics
go into samadhi there.
Divine mother,
give me devotion,
give me love,
protect me by giving me faith.
Say this prayer.
In Rama's age,
devils lived closer,
in a neighbouring land.
In Krishna's age,
devils lived in our families.
Now they are even closer,
they are inside us.
These devils,
we must kill them to succeed.
They are arrogance,
selfishness and greed.
To gain peace of mind,
we must be ready to battle.
Not to battle with real weapons,
but with love,
devotion and sacrifice.
A battle without bloodshed.
Only peace and love.
Look at our society.
We spend a lot of money
travelling to the depths
of the oceans and space to study them.
But we never travel
to our inner world,
which is so close at hand.
Everyone loves TVs
with bigger screens.
But as the screens get bigger,
our hearts get smaller.
We have vacuum cleaners
that suck up
the tiniest dirt.
Yet we are not ready
to clean the dirt from our minds.
Our minds make our lives
beautiful or ugly.
We try to learn
about the outside world,
but never the inner world.
We try to right the outside world
and forget to right ourselves.
We are slaves to the outside world.
We bear many physical
and mental scars.
We bear many unhealed wounds.
Total happiness cannot come
from the outside world.
It's like trying to hold the sky
or sail across land.
Life is short,
we must try to celebrate it.
You hold only this moment
in your hands.
Sensual feelings are fleeting.
Unaffected by them is the wise man,
who, equating pleasure and pain,
attains immortality.
That day Amma took 45000 people
into her arms for 21 hours.
23 million people
have received Amma's Darshan.
