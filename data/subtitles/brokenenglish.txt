00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:53,053
# Blue is where I want to be

2
00:01:53,846 --> 00:01:57,683
# When I'm down I'm in the sea

3
00:01:58,309 --> 00:02:03,188
# Looking up at monsters in the clouds

4
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:08,402
# Red's the colour when you're dead

5
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:11,822
# If you find me gone,
I'm just in bed

6
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:16,244
# Reading up on fairy tales instead

7
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:32,385
# Now I know so many things

8
00:02:32,511 --> 00:02:35,263
# Got feet and I got wings

9
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:39,434
# To carry me back home

10
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:45,064
# To my house that's made of bricks

11
00:02:45,107 --> 00:02:48,234
# Well, that's just such a fix

12
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:52,030
# To ever hold me down

13
00:02:54,074 --> 00:02:57,035
# White is what I was to start

14
00:02:57,077 --> 00:03:00,413
# Broken by my open heart

15
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:02,290
# Dum-de-dee-dee

16
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:05,084
# Dee-dee, dum-de-dum #

17
00:03:05,127 --> 00:03:06,753
Hi, Rick.

18
00:03:07,546 --> 00:03:08,921
Hi, Skunk.

19
00:03:09,049 --> 00:03:10,466
That looks good.

20
00:03:10,633 --> 00:03:12,384
Oh, um...

21
00:03:14,095 --> 00:03:18,223
Yeah, you have to do
the water first... Um...

22
00:03:18,266 --> 00:03:21,268
And then the suds
and then the water again,

23
00:03:22,062 --> 00:03:23,437
um, to like...

24
00:03:23,772 --> 00:03:25,397
rinse it.

25
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,607
Is it hard?

26
00:03:26,733 --> 00:03:28,609
Oh, it's... it's really hard.

27
00:03:28,985 --> 00:03:30,819
But I... I like it...
I like it when something's clean

28
00:03:30,945 --> 00:03:34,740
'cause you, you see it dirty
and then you clean it,

29
00:03:35,992 --> 00:03:39,244
and then it's... clean
and you wash it

30
00:03:40,121 --> 00:03:43,957
and it's clean
and then it's done.

31
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:46,126
Cool. I'll see you later, yeah?

32
00:03:46,795 --> 00:03:48,170
See you.

33
00:03:48,421 --> 00:03:49,797
Hi, Mr Oswald.

34
00:03:49,923 --> 00:03:51,298
Hello, darling.

35
00:03:52,425 --> 00:03:53,425
Ah!

36
00:03:57,138 --> 00:03:58,305
No! No!

37
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:21,788
Rick.

38
00:04:23,165 --> 00:04:24,499
Are you okay, Rick?

39
00:04:26,335 --> 00:04:28,503
Rick? Rick!

40
00:04:28,963 --> 00:04:30,547
Dave! Dave!

41
00:04:30,673 --> 00:04:32,507
Skunk, go home!
Go back into your house.

42
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:34,300
It was Mr Oswald.

43
00:04:34,343 --> 00:04:36,177
Oh, my God. Oh, my...

44
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,220
Dave!

45
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,472
My baby. My...

46
00:04:43,686 --> 00:04:45,186
Jed.

47
00:04:45,688 --> 00:04:47,480
Can I come with you?

48
00:04:47,523 --> 00:04:49,357
Can I come in the same car?

49
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,025
- Would that be okay, if I come with him?
- I'm afraid not.

50
00:04:51,152 --> 00:04:52,527
You're more than welcome to...

51
00:04:52,653 --> 00:04:53,862
We'll, um, drive down behind.

52
00:04:53,988 --> 00:04:56,699
I don't get it.
Why is Rick the one they arrest?

53
00:04:56,825 --> 00:04:58,200
I don't know.

54
00:05:20,015 --> 00:05:22,099
- Fucking give it to me!
- Dad, fuck off! No.

55
00:05:22,225 --> 00:05:24,685
Thank you. Come on, everyone.

56
00:05:24,728 --> 00:05:26,604
Dad!
What are you doing?

57
00:05:28,899 --> 00:05:30,399
Shut up!

58
00:05:30,442 --> 00:05:33,527
Shut up! You're too fat to sing.

59
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,905
Shut up.

60
00:05:36,531 --> 00:05:38,073
- Susan?
- Yeah?

61
00:05:38,116 --> 00:05:41,076
- Are you in my fucking room?
- No.

62
00:05:57,261 --> 00:05:59,888
What the fuck is this?

63
00:06:00,806 --> 00:06:02,599
- Who have you been having sex with?
- I haven't!

64
00:06:02,725 --> 00:06:04,434
I didn't even know what it was!

65
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,478
Oh, don't give me that bullshit.
Where did you get it?

66
00:06:06,604 --> 00:06:08,647
- I stole it.
- Bullshit. Stole it from who?

67
00:06:08,773 --> 00:06:09,981
- I ain't...
- Huh? I taught...

68
00:06:10,107 --> 00:06:11,399
Didn't I teach you?

69
00:06:11,442 --> 00:06:13,360
- What?
- Keep your fucking legs shut.

70
00:06:13,444 --> 00:06:15,612
Give me his name.
Give me his fucking name!

71
00:06:16,113 --> 00:06:18,031
Right. Here you...

72
00:06:18,115 --> 00:06:19,533
- No, Dad!
- Not the telly.

73
00:06:19,617 --> 00:06:20,742
I will!

74
00:06:20,785 --> 00:06:23,787
Give him his name,
you stupid fucking twat!

75
00:06:24,872 --> 00:06:26,206
# Up

76
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:28,458
# Across and thrust,
thrust, thrust

77
00:06:36,592 --> 00:06:38,385
What the hell are you looking at?

78
00:06:39,303 --> 00:06:40,470
You dirty perv.

79
00:06:44,476 --> 00:06:45,601
Rick Buckley.

80
00:06:47,229 --> 00:06:48,563
Rick Buckley?

81
00:06:53,944 --> 00:06:55,319
He forced himself on you,
didn't he?

82
00:06:55,445 --> 00:06:56,821
No, no, we, we...

83
00:06:56,947 --> 00:06:58,614
- Jesus Christ. The animal.
- Dad.

84
00:06:59,157 --> 00:07:01,284
The dirty, retarded fucking animal.

85
00:07:03,996 --> 00:07:05,580
- Hi, Mr Oswald.
- Hello, darling.

86
00:07:05,664 --> 00:07:06,664
Ah!

87
00:07:11,587 --> 00:07:14,255
- Hello, Mr Oswald.
- I want to report a rape.

88
00:07:23,265 --> 00:07:25,683
All right. You can put
your clothes back on.

89
00:07:26,351 --> 00:07:27,602
You are a fucking prick!

90
00:07:27,686 --> 00:07:29,770
- You do your fucking job!
- You talk to me like that...

91
00:07:29,855 --> 00:07:31,105
- This fucking rapist...
- Just calm...

92
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:32,690
- ... needs to be put behind bars!
- Calm down, Mr...

93
00:07:32,774 --> 00:07:35,652
Your daughter has not been raped.

94
00:07:36,362 --> 00:07:37,529
What the fuck are
you talking about?

95
00:07:37,655 --> 00:07:39,364
Your daughter's a virgin,
Mr Oswald.

96
00:07:39,449 --> 00:07:41,366
She's never had intercourse.

97
00:07:44,203 --> 00:07:47,205
- 'Course she fucking has! She's...
- Dad. Dad, she's right.

98
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:50,459
It never happened.

99
00:07:53,046 --> 00:07:54,046
Susan.

100
00:07:54,172 --> 00:07:56,214
- I only said it did because...
- Susan...

101
00:07:56,674 --> 00:08:00,010
You wouldn't believe what
I told you and I didn't want you

102
00:08:00,803 --> 00:08:04,306
- to smash up the telly.
- Susan, Susan, Susan. Susan.

103
00:08:06,351 --> 00:08:08,477
All right, you don't have to be afraid.

104
00:08:08,561 --> 00:08:10,145
- Mr Oswald...
- Shut up.

105
00:08:10,229 --> 00:08:11,647
- Mr Oswald...
- Shut up!

106
00:08:13,316 --> 00:08:15,192
Of them. Of him.

107
00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:17,569
You don't have to be afraid.

108
00:08:43,931 --> 00:08:48,601
Do you want to press charges,
Mr Buckley, against Mr Oswald?

109
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:53,189
I want to go home.

110
00:09:00,948 --> 00:09:02,865
They should all be put in a home.

111
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:04,742
- They should.
- Him in a jail.

112
00:09:07,705 --> 00:09:09,455
Are you all right, love?

113
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:15,128
Bloody animals.

114
00:09:56,337 --> 00:09:58,172
How are your levels?

115
00:09:58,256 --> 00:09:59,757
Good.

116
00:10:00,508 --> 00:10:02,509
How was your day?

117
00:10:10,685 --> 00:10:12,771
He hit him really hard, Dad.

118
00:10:13,814 --> 00:10:15,356
So I heard.

119
00:10:17,151 --> 00:10:18,777
You want to talk about it?

120
00:10:19,028 --> 00:10:20,528
No.

121
00:10:22,156 --> 00:10:24,532
Do you want me to stay with you
till you fall asleep?

122
00:10:24,658 --> 00:10:26,117
That's okay.

123
00:10:28,829 --> 00:10:31,372
- Can I have my hand back?
- Yeah.

124
00:10:34,043 --> 00:10:35,877
- Good night, love.
- Night.

125
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,228
- Where the hell did I put my glasses?
- Red sofa.

126
00:10:53,312 --> 00:10:55,063
Oh, right.

127
00:10:58,567 --> 00:10:59,984
- Archie.
- Yeah.

128
00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:02,070
It's Tuesday. My wages.

129
00:11:02,321 --> 00:11:05,407
Oh, crap. Um, can I pay you tonight?

130
00:11:06,076 --> 00:11:07,910
- I won't forget, I promise.
- Yeah.

131
00:11:08,036 --> 00:11:10,079
- Ooh. Early riser.
- What time is it?

132
00:11:10,163 --> 00:11:11,247
It's ten past eight.

133
00:11:11,373 --> 00:11:13,666
Oh, I thought it was like
eleven or something.

134
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,000
Where do you think
you're going?

135
00:11:15,085 --> 00:11:16,085
To lie down.

136
00:11:16,169 --> 00:11:17,753
No, you're not. Get back in here.
Get your breakfast.

137
00:11:17,838 --> 00:11:20,172
- Bye, Dad.
- Yeah, bye, love.

138
00:11:21,424 --> 00:11:22,883
All right?

139
00:11:23,718 --> 00:11:25,261
Scrambled egg?

140
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:27,263
Do we not have anything better?

141
00:11:27,347 --> 00:11:29,390
We have scrambled egg.

142
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:38,107
What?

143
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,902
Nothing. I'll be out in the back.

144
00:11:44,364 --> 00:11:45,781
What?

145
00:11:45,866 --> 00:11:48,784
I'm just saying, cancer and all.
You'll catch it.

146
00:11:49,035 --> 00:11:51,287
Yeah, well, you make your choices,
don't you?

147
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:54,790
So annoying.

148
00:12:08,723 --> 00:12:10,265
It's gonna be great.

149
00:12:10,308 --> 00:12:11,308
Mm-hm.

150
00:12:11,434 --> 00:12:13,602
- A secret room.
- Come on.

151
00:12:13,644 --> 00:12:15,979
Not a room. A camp.

152
00:12:16,147 --> 00:12:17,606
A base.

153
00:12:20,151 --> 00:12:21,610
A lair.

154
00:12:21,652 --> 00:12:22,986
What?

155
00:12:23,112 --> 00:12:24,321
Nothing.

156
00:12:24,405 --> 00:12:25,822
A lair.

157
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:28,325
- Quick, take my picture.
- What?

158
00:12:28,409 --> 00:12:30,744
- Take my picture in front of it.
- Christ.

159
00:12:30,828 --> 00:12:32,329
Come on!

160
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:45,592
Hi.

161
00:12:49,138 --> 00:12:50,680
I'm sorry.

162
00:13:02,444 --> 00:13:04,946
No, no. Stop.

163
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,489
No.

164
00:13:06,823 --> 00:13:08,199
Gross.

165
00:13:08,492 --> 00:13:09,867
Nice move.

166
00:13:09,993 --> 00:13:11,202
Stop, stop.

167
00:13:11,286 --> 00:13:12,536
Hi, guys.

168
00:13:12,663 --> 00:13:15,289
- Come on. Look, this is a six.
- That's cheating.

169
00:13:15,374 --> 00:13:17,792
- What? Stop doing that.
- This is a nine. Come on.

170
00:13:17,876 --> 00:13:19,543
- Mike.
- Yeah?

171
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:22,213
- When you're a teacher...
- Blue.

172
00:13:22,339 --> 00:13:24,173
...will you still bring us treats
and stuff?

173
00:13:24,216 --> 00:13:27,218
Uh, no.
That's all gonna have to end, Skunk.

174
00:13:27,302 --> 00:13:28,469
Really?

175
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:31,973
Well, you see, the relationship
between student and teacher

176
00:13:32,849 --> 00:13:34,892
- is by its nature...
- You won't be our teacher.

177
00:13:35,018 --> 00:13:36,560
- Well, you never know, Jed.
- Mike.

178
00:13:36,687 --> 00:13:38,729
- By nature is what?
- Well, it's adversarial.

179
00:13:39,064 --> 00:13:40,314
- What does that mean?
- Go.

180
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,901
Well, it means that it'll be my job
to see you as the enemy.

181
00:13:43,986 --> 00:13:46,738
- He's full of shit.
- Somebody only worthy of my contempt.

182
00:13:46,823 --> 00:13:48,156
- Mike!
- And you'll begin to see me

183
00:13:48,241 --> 00:13:49,241
- that way too.
- Mike!

184
00:13:50,076 --> 00:13:51,743
- Whose go is it?
- Yours.

185
00:13:51,828 --> 00:13:53,078
Okay.

186
00:13:53,204 --> 00:13:55,747
- I won't ever see you that way, Mike.
- Aw.

187
00:13:55,915 --> 00:13:58,083
- It's 'cause you're in love with him.
- No, I'm not!

188
00:13:58,167 --> 00:13:59,376
Guys, guys.

189
00:13:59,419 --> 00:14:02,587
In my experience, the person
who brings up the subject of love

190
00:14:02,672 --> 00:14:05,841
is more often than not
the person who is in love.

191
00:14:05,925 --> 00:14:07,259
- Really?
- Shut up.

192
00:14:07,385 --> 00:14:09,344
You're blushing, Jed.

193
00:14:09,429 --> 00:14:11,930
What about you two?
Are you in love?

194
00:14:12,098 --> 00:14:13,932
Mike and I?
Of course.

195
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,101
Then why aren't you married yet?

196
00:14:19,272 --> 00:14:20,522
That's the question.

197
00:14:28,281 --> 00:14:29,865
- All good?
- Uh-huh.

198
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,534
- Night.
- Night.

199
00:14:33,286 --> 00:14:34,453
Close your curtains.

200
00:14:42,546 --> 00:14:44,464
Have you called Dr Curtis?

201
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:47,925
Oh, yes, but he says, uh,
he can't act in any way

202
00:14:47,968 --> 00:14:50,386
without Rick's permission.

203
00:14:50,929 --> 00:14:52,805
- Which he won't give.
- This is what I'm saying.

204
00:14:52,931 --> 00:14:54,599
He won't come out
of his bedroom, Archie.

205
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:57,977
Janet sits outside
his door all day

206
00:14:58,062 --> 00:14:59,937
trying to talk to him,
and nothing.

207
00:15:05,986 --> 00:15:09,489
I'm sorry to drop in on you
like this, out of the blue,

208
00:15:09,573 --> 00:15:11,282
but I just...
You know, I just thought...

209
00:15:11,325 --> 00:15:13,993
I thought, "Well, Archie,
he's a... a solicitor and..."

210
00:15:14,119 --> 00:15:16,829
So you want...
you want to take this matter further?

211
00:15:16,955 --> 00:15:19,457
You want to make this a legal matter?

212
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,918
Bloody legal action?
No, no, no. Forget it. Uh...

213
00:15:22,002 --> 00:15:23,836
I don't want anything more
to do with the bastard.

214
00:15:24,338 --> 00:15:26,339
- Oswald?
- Yes.

215
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,007
Why not?

216
00:15:29,176 --> 00:15:31,178
Because I'm scared of him.

217
00:15:32,347 --> 00:15:34,431
I'm just really bloody scared of him.

218
00:15:35,642 --> 00:15:38,852
And you went under the water.

219
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:40,479
Five years old.

220
00:15:42,357 --> 00:15:47,277
And your father ran so fast
across those stones to get you.

221
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,446
And he got you.

222
00:15:51,032 --> 00:15:52,783
He saved you.

223
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:59,373
And then...

224
00:16:13,346 --> 00:16:16,974
Hello, Mrs Buckley.
Is Rick in?

225
00:16:17,225 --> 00:16:18,642
Why?

226
00:16:18,893 --> 00:16:20,352
Don't know.

227
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:22,688
Just thought he might like
to hang out or something.

228
00:16:22,772 --> 00:16:25,400
He's ill, love. He can't come out.

229
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,610
Oh...

230
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:30,113
- Okay, well...
- Goodbye now, love.

231
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:31,781
Bye.

232
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:53,678
And anyway...

233
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:58,766
Then we bought you
that Matchbox tank.

234
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,811
Do you remember?
For being so brave.

235
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:05,315
And you tried to give it
to your dad

236
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:07,984
because he'd cut his feet up

237
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,904
running over those stones.

238
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:13,865
So kind, you were, so...

239
00:17:19,122 --> 00:17:22,541
I mean,
what five-year-old in the world...

240
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:26,587
would have done that, huh?

241
00:17:37,182 --> 00:17:38,807
Um...

242
00:17:43,063 --> 00:17:45,814
Stupid.

243
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:58,786
- Hello, Archie.
- Bob.

244
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:00,704
What can I do for you?

245
00:18:01,456 --> 00:18:04,375
I was wondering if we
could have a little chat.

246
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:05,709
- Chat?
- Yeah.

247
00:18:05,794 --> 00:18:07,294
Yeah, absolutely.

248
00:18:12,051 --> 00:18:14,552
Okay, well, um...

249
00:18:16,389 --> 00:18:21,601
I know things have been... tough for you
since Barbara passed away, you know?

250
00:18:21,686 --> 00:18:24,271
For you and for the girls, you know?
And what with...

251
00:18:24,355 --> 00:18:26,606
everything that's
been happening lately...

252
00:18:26,691 --> 00:18:30,318
I just... I wanted you to know that,
you know, if ever you wanted to talk...

253
00:18:30,403 --> 00:18:31,528
- Talk?
- Yeah.

254
00:18:31,612 --> 00:18:32,946
Fuck off, Archie, will you?

255
00:18:38,035 --> 00:18:39,160
All right. Um...

256
00:18:39,829 --> 00:18:43,957
Well, what I wanted
to ask you was, uh...

257
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:49,379
if you could ask your girls
to give the Buckleys a break.

258
00:18:50,506 --> 00:18:52,048
They've been having
a tough time of it lately.

259
00:18:52,133 --> 00:18:53,216
- Have they?
- Yeah.

260
00:18:53,509 --> 00:18:56,094
That's really awful.

261
00:19:01,601 --> 00:19:03,811
When was the last time
you cried, Archie?

262
00:19:05,147 --> 00:19:06,355
- Cried?
- Yeah.

263
00:19:06,732 --> 00:19:08,816
- I don't know. Why?
- 'Cause the next time you will

264
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:11,402
is the next time that you criticise
my girls... No, hang on.

265
00:19:11,486 --> 00:19:13,904
...in any fucking way
whatsoever, all right?

266
00:19:13,989 --> 00:19:15,489
They're out of bounds.

267
00:19:16,033 --> 00:19:18,743
And if Buckley can't take
a little friendly fucking ribbing,

268
00:19:18,827 --> 00:19:22,079
then he's more of a pathetic prick
than I thought he was.

269
00:19:22,164 --> 00:19:24,206
Now, I'm having my dinner, mate,
so if you don't mind fucking off.

270
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:26,375
Thanks.

271
00:19:37,804 --> 00:19:39,221
You know what'd make it better?

272
00:19:39,306 --> 00:19:40,514
A Blu-ray player.

273
00:19:40,599 --> 00:19:41,807
Yeah, well,
you can't have everything, Jed.

274
00:19:41,892 --> 00:19:43,225
No, I'm just saying.

275
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:45,770
I got you that ashtray, didn't I?

276
00:19:46,021 --> 00:19:48,022
That's what I'm saying, Skunk.
It's brilliant.

277
00:19:48,231 --> 00:19:50,107
It's the best ever.

278
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:55,781
- Be great if we never had to go back.
- What, to school?

279
00:19:55,865 --> 00:19:56,990
Yeah.

280
00:19:57,075 --> 00:19:59,826
I don't know. I'm kind of
looking forward to going, actually.

281
00:19:59,911 --> 00:20:02,245
Oh, first year.

282
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:03,330
What?

283
00:20:03,414 --> 00:20:05,082
Sometimes when you're walking
down the corridors,

284
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:06,958
- the older kids will punch you.
- What?

285
00:20:07,043 --> 00:20:08,251
In the stomach.

286
00:20:09,504 --> 00:20:10,504
Idiots!

287
00:20:10,588 --> 00:20:12,172
- Watch where you're going, will you?
- Listen, mate,

288
00:20:12,298 --> 00:20:14,091
it's not our fault
you can't ride your bike.

289
00:20:14,175 --> 00:20:18,011
It's not my bike.
And I can ride it. Watch this.

290
00:20:18,096 --> 00:20:19,346
Whose is it, then?

291
00:20:20,431 --> 00:20:22,641
- That is a travesty.
- Hang on, hang on.

292
00:20:22,725 --> 00:20:24,309
Right, you ready?

293
00:20:27,146 --> 00:20:28,855
Hey! You thieving little spastic!

294
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:29,940
I'll kill you!

295
00:20:30,024 --> 00:20:32,526
I'll kill you! I'll bloody kill you!

296
00:20:34,028 --> 00:20:35,320
Twats!

297
00:20:36,823 --> 00:20:38,365
- Yes!
- What the fucking hell?

298
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:44,079
Fucking hell!

299
00:20:51,296 --> 00:20:53,005
So who do you live with, then?

300
00:20:53,215 --> 00:20:54,632
My auntie.

301
00:20:54,716 --> 00:20:57,218
- Where's your dad?
- He's dead.

302
00:20:57,845 --> 00:20:59,345
Dead?

303
00:20:59,763 --> 00:21:02,974
He was killed in a fire,
along with my mum.

304
00:21:03,058 --> 00:21:05,935
- That's terrible.
- And my sister.

305
00:21:09,982 --> 00:21:13,192
I don't give a shit.
I was only five or six at the time.

306
00:21:13,527 --> 00:21:15,111
Oh.

307
00:21:15,612 --> 00:21:17,613
Wow. Cool.

308
00:21:20,742 --> 00:21:23,870
Our mum ran away
with an accountant from Birmingham.

309
00:21:23,954 --> 00:21:27,123
Yeah? So are you a lesbian?

310
00:21:27,249 --> 00:21:28,708
No.

311
00:21:28,792 --> 00:21:30,209
You look like a lesbian.

312
00:21:30,294 --> 00:21:32,295
What does a lesbian look like?

313
00:21:34,256 --> 00:21:35,840
Kind of ugly.

314
00:21:36,049 --> 00:21:37,258
Oi, Skunk!

315
00:21:39,011 --> 00:21:40,804
No, but just stop
them taking him.

316
00:21:40,889 --> 00:21:42,389
Dave, why don't you
just go in there and do something?

317
00:21:42,474 --> 00:21:44,808
- Calm down. I'm really...
- Sort it out, for Christ's sake.

318
00:21:44,893 --> 00:21:46,351
He's coming!

319
00:21:46,478 --> 00:21:48,353
Rick, Rick. You've done
nothing wrong, Rick.

320
00:21:48,521 --> 00:21:50,147
Here he is.

321
00:21:50,231 --> 00:21:52,107
- Get the straitjacket.
- Stop it!

322
00:21:52,192 --> 00:21:54,943
- Lock him up!
- Rick! Rick! I love you.

323
00:21:55,028 --> 00:21:57,029
Put him in a padded fucking cell,
the psycho.

324
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,198
Cut his knob off.

325
00:22:00,617 --> 00:22:02,159
Feed it to him.

326
00:22:02,243 --> 00:22:04,203
His donkey fucking knob!

327
00:22:04,454 --> 00:22:06,079
Hee-haw, hee-haw!

328
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:10,167
Jed.

329
00:22:11,544 --> 00:22:13,670
- Has Rick gone mental?
- Shut up and go inside.

330
00:22:13,755 --> 00:22:15,172
Where are you going?

331
00:22:15,256 --> 00:22:17,132
- He's coming in to play Xbox.
- No, he's not.

332
00:22:17,217 --> 00:22:19,593
Bye-bye.
Off you go back to your halting site.

333
00:22:19,802 --> 00:22:22,387
- I ain't no pikey.
- That's racist, Kasia.

334
00:22:22,597 --> 00:22:24,556
- Sorry, mate. She's Polish.
- Skunk!

335
00:22:32,065 --> 00:22:34,317
- Bye.
- You don't look like a lesbian.

336
00:22:34,527 --> 00:22:36,528
No? So why'd you say I did, then?

337
00:22:37,613 --> 00:22:39,739
- I don't know.
- Because I'm ugly?

338
00:22:39,823 --> 00:22:40,823
No, you're not.

339
00:22:41,575 --> 00:22:43,201
You're really pretty.

340
00:22:44,828 --> 00:22:47,580
- Am I?
- No. You're ugly.

341
00:22:48,123 --> 00:22:49,415
See ya.

342
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:51,793
Well, sitting outside his bedroom
door all day's not gonna help.

343
00:22:51,877 --> 00:22:52,961
It's that kind of babying...

344
00:22:53,045 --> 00:22:54,170
- Babying?
- Yes.

345
00:22:54,255 --> 00:22:56,714
You don't know whether you're coming
or going. Look at yourself.

346
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:58,800
When did you last have a shower?

347
00:22:59,635 --> 00:23:02,053
- Our son is sick.
- Give him a break.

348
00:23:02,137 --> 00:23:05,306
- Our son needs to know I'm here!
- Calm down... Well, I'll...

349
00:23:05,391 --> 00:23:07,225
Please, don't. Please, don't.

350
00:23:07,309 --> 00:23:09,227
Rick, get out of this room!

351
00:23:09,311 --> 00:23:11,479
Rick, open this door.
If you don't open this door...

352
00:23:11,564 --> 00:23:13,898
I'm... Rick, I'm coming in, you...

353
00:23:14,942 --> 00:23:16,067
Ah!

354
00:23:25,953 --> 00:23:27,621
I asked the doctor they had there

355
00:23:28,206 --> 00:23:30,624
how long they could keep him in,
and, uh...

356
00:23:31,751 --> 00:23:34,128
he said, indefinitely.

357
00:23:34,671 --> 00:23:37,047
- Right.
- Is that true?

358
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:39,800
Well, um...

359
00:23:41,219 --> 00:23:44,054
If a patient's been sectioned,

360
00:23:44,139 --> 00:23:49,143
they have the right to keep them in
as long as they see fit.

361
00:23:49,352 --> 00:23:51,145
I see.

362
00:23:53,523 --> 00:23:55,524
I'm sorry, Dave.

363
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:04,742
What's it like?

364
00:24:04,826 --> 00:24:06,160
I don't know. I don't know.

365
00:24:06,369 --> 00:24:07,953
Is it like
'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest?'

366
00:24:09,623 --> 00:24:12,207
- Stop it!
- Wait, hang on. You saw that?

367
00:24:12,292 --> 00:24:14,460
Kasia fell asleep in front
of the telly one night.

368
00:24:14,669 --> 00:24:16,920
Oh, my God. Was she drinking?

369
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:18,797
What? I'm joking.

370
00:24:18,965 --> 00:24:20,675
- Ooh.
- They cut a part

371
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,843
- of his brain out.
- Who?

372
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:23,762
McMurphy.

373
00:24:23,846 --> 00:24:25,013
- Stop it!
- Jed.

374
00:24:25,097 --> 00:24:27,682
Look, listen, that is not
gonna happen to Rick, okay?

375
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:29,017
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

376
00:24:29,101 --> 00:24:31,227
- How do you know?
- Because I just know.

377
00:24:31,437 --> 00:24:33,813
That sort of stuff, you know,
it just isn't...

378
00:24:33,898 --> 00:24:36,858
- ...done any more.
- Ugh. Stop it.

379
00:24:36,942 --> 00:24:39,277
All right,
let's go and make these things fly.

380
00:24:44,492 --> 00:24:46,117
Whoa.

381
00:25:09,183 --> 00:25:12,018
...fucking obsessing!
Every single...

382
00:25:12,104 --> 00:25:15,231
It's because you're avoiding...
I'm not obsessing about a thing.

383
00:25:15,607 --> 00:25:16,982
Why can't we just have
a normal...

384
00:25:17,067 --> 00:25:19,777
Why can't we just have
a normal conversation?

385
00:25:19,861 --> 00:25:23,072
When I come over here,
it's my life, my life. What am I doing?

386
00:25:23,156 --> 00:25:25,783
Can I just live my life? I'm getting
this job because you asked me...

387
00:25:25,867 --> 00:25:27,076
What are you doing with me?

388
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,577
You know what, I am fucking out of here.

389
00:25:28,662 --> 00:25:30,746
I was just about to say
that you should...

390
00:25:30,831 --> 00:25:32,790
I'm actually going!
So there you go!

391
00:25:32,874 --> 00:25:36,168
- Where are you going now?
- Fucking home to my manky flat.

392
00:25:36,378 --> 00:25:37,545
Asshole.

393
00:25:37,629 --> 00:25:39,255
I mean, why the hell
are you with a person

394
00:25:39,339 --> 00:25:42,258
unless you plan
to stay with that person, you know?

395
00:25:42,342 --> 00:25:45,010
Fucking out of here!

396
00:25:45,095 --> 00:25:47,096
Fucking coward. Asshole.

397
00:25:54,938 --> 00:25:56,480
Are you and Mike splitting up?

398
00:25:58,108 --> 00:25:59,608
Go to bed.

399
00:25:59,901 --> 00:26:01,652
And the things he said to me...

400
00:26:01,737 --> 00:26:03,112
- You know what he called me?
- What?

401
00:26:03,196 --> 00:26:06,241
- Obsessive fucking bitch.
- Mm.

402
00:26:07,076 --> 00:26:08,076
Fuck you!

403
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:13,832
I'm just so worn out with it,
Archie, you know?

404
00:26:18,171 --> 00:26:21,381
Well, we could sue him, I suppose.

405
00:26:21,466 --> 00:26:23,717
- Yeah, for what?
- I don't know.

406
00:26:24,302 --> 00:26:26,386
Dereliction of premarital duty.

407
00:26:26,846 --> 00:26:31,183
Very funny.
How about just for being a dick?

408
00:26:31,267 --> 00:26:33,477
- Yeah, we could get him for that.
- A lazy dick.

409
00:26:33,561 --> 00:26:37,022
He values his freedom too much,
his comforts.

410
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:41,359
Well, most men do.
That's why we need that push.

411
00:26:41,652 --> 00:26:43,278
I've been pushing long enough.

412
00:26:43,613 --> 00:26:46,448
Four years.
I'm 35 years old, you know?

413
00:26:46,532 --> 00:26:48,784
- Really?
- Fuck off. I can't wait any more

414
00:26:48,868 --> 00:26:50,619
I just can't.

415
00:26:51,913 --> 00:26:53,705
- Is that my wine?
- No.

416
00:27:01,507 --> 00:27:03,591
What are you doing here?

417
00:27:03,717 --> 00:27:05,718
Just thought I'd knock about.

418
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:07,428
Jed isn't here.

419
00:27:13,352 --> 00:27:16,938
So angry. And she
was crying and...

420
00:27:17,022 --> 00:27:19,398
- I think she really loved him.
- Yeah?

421
00:27:19,608 --> 00:27:23,569
I think she wanted them to
get married. Or buy a house.

422
00:27:23,695 --> 00:27:26,113
- Or have a baby maybe.
- Right.

423
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,199
- I would have married him.
- Yeah?

424
00:27:28,283 --> 00:27:29,742
Mm.

425
00:27:36,041 --> 00:27:37,416
Oh, wow.

426
00:27:43,131 --> 00:27:44,590
Come on!

427
00:27:47,928 --> 00:27:49,595
Oh, wow.

428
00:27:58,648 --> 00:28:00,065
Dillon!

429
00:28:05,446 --> 00:28:07,906
This is really cool.
It's like...

430
00:28:08,241 --> 00:28:10,158
Come in.

431
00:28:12,453 --> 00:28:15,122
- You're a really cool girl.
- Thanks.

432
00:28:15,456 --> 00:28:16,456
For a lesbian.

433
00:28:25,008 --> 00:28:26,008
Do you want a Nik Nak?

434
00:28:27,677 --> 00:28:29,678
No, thanks.

435
00:28:31,556 --> 00:28:33,807
Must be a pain
not being able to eat what you want.

436
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:39,771
Do you want to be my girlfriend?

437
00:28:42,025 --> 00:28:43,650
Okay.

438
00:28:44,695 --> 00:28:45,737
Can I have a kiss?

439
00:28:47,114 --> 00:28:48,865
M... Maybe later.

440
00:28:49,366 --> 00:28:53,870
All right, but later
my mouth's gonna be all Nik-y Nak-y.

441
00:28:54,955 --> 00:28:58,625
All right. But not a splasher.

442
00:28:59,376 --> 00:29:01,085
- A what?
- No swirly tongues.

443
00:29:02,171 --> 00:29:04,505
Okay.

444
00:29:20,814 --> 00:29:22,941
Look, you've got pretty ears.
It doesn't hurt that much.

445
00:29:23,025 --> 00:29:25,109
- Get off. It hurts.
- Stop it.

446
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:30,073
Get your arms out.

447
00:29:30,157 --> 00:29:32,492
- There, one up your nose.
- No, no.

448
00:29:34,078 --> 00:29:37,122
Look, if you keep moving your arms,
I can't give you a lovely nose piercing.

449
00:29:39,751 --> 00:29:42,461
- Get off.
- You look so pretty.

450
00:29:45,173 --> 00:29:47,174
Give me your eyebrow.

451
00:29:49,928 --> 00:29:51,303
There we go.

452
00:29:51,388 --> 00:29:53,472
All right, guys.
Come on, bed.

453
00:29:53,556 --> 00:29:54,723
But we're doing our books.

454
00:29:54,933 --> 00:29:56,141
Bed.

455
00:29:56,309 --> 00:29:57,768
Dad.

456
00:29:57,852 --> 00:30:00,604
Come on, do as you're told.
Big day tomorrow.

457
00:30:01,815 --> 00:30:03,524
Night, Dad.

458
00:30:04,901 --> 00:30:06,694
- Good night, love.
- Good night.

459
00:30:06,778 --> 00:30:07,778
Very attractive.

460
00:30:07,862 --> 00:30:11,699
Yeah, all right, yeah.
Good, yeah.

461
00:30:13,284 --> 00:30:14,910
Hey, where's mine?

462
00:30:14,995 --> 00:30:16,412
Night, Kasia.

463
00:30:16,496 --> 00:30:18,038
Very funny.

464
00:30:18,123 --> 00:30:19,748
And don't forget teeth!

465
00:30:30,803 --> 00:30:32,303
You want a drink?

466
00:30:33,347 --> 00:30:35,807
And if you're wearing trainers,
they'll stomp on them. Bang!

467
00:30:35,891 --> 00:30:37,017
And if your hair's too long,

468
00:30:37,101 --> 00:30:38,643
what they'll do is
they'll grab it from behind.

469
00:30:38,728 --> 00:30:40,895
- All right. Stop!
- And they'll just start...

470
00:30:41,772 --> 00:30:44,232
You need to know
about this stuff, Skunk.

471
00:30:44,316 --> 00:30:46,735
The better prepared you are,
the better you'll do.

472
00:30:47,445 --> 00:30:50,822
So, what they do
is they grab your hair from behind

473
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:53,700
and they just start snipping away
with a pair of scissors.

474
00:30:53,784 --> 00:30:55,827
- So you pick your moment.
- Yeah.

475
00:30:56,287 --> 00:30:57,704
And you let them know
the arrangement.

476
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:59,664
Yeah... What?

477
00:30:59,749 --> 00:31:01,624
- The deal.
- Right.

478
00:31:02,877 --> 00:31:04,878
And then they know where they stand.

479
00:31:05,504 --> 00:31:07,589
- Yeah.
- Which is...

480
00:31:08,215 --> 00:31:11,301
- Nowhere.
- Absolutely fucking nowhere.

481
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:19,893
- It's funnier later on.
- Okay.

482
00:31:52,052 --> 00:31:54,053
What about Rachel?

483
00:31:56,890 --> 00:31:58,599
What about her?

484
00:31:58,892 --> 00:32:00,684
If she walked in right now,

485
00:32:01,728 --> 00:32:03,354
would you take her back?

486
00:32:03,438 --> 00:32:04,855
You must be joking.

487
00:32:07,567 --> 00:32:10,319
- Not even for the kids?
- Why?

488
00:32:10,737 --> 00:32:12,947
So they could live in fear
of her walking out again

489
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:15,784
whenever she felt like it?
No, thank you very much.

490
00:32:17,203 --> 00:32:18,829
They wouldn't even know

491
00:32:19,163 --> 00:32:20,789
who she was.

492
00:32:21,874 --> 00:32:23,291
Poor Archie.

493
00:32:27,213 --> 00:32:29,214
Poor Kasia.

494
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,821
I'm off to bed.

495
00:32:53,406 --> 00:32:55,407
All right, then.

496
00:32:57,368 --> 00:32:59,369
- Good night.
- Good night.

497
00:33:05,877 --> 00:33:07,878
You can follow me up if you want.

498
00:33:26,648 --> 00:33:28,274
Dad?

499
00:33:31,195 --> 00:33:32,737
Dad!

500
00:33:38,243 --> 00:33:39,911
Why aren't you in bed?

501
00:33:39,995 --> 00:33:43,164
Jed said I was gonna get my
head flushed down the toilet.

502
00:33:43,373 --> 00:33:45,583
- By who?
- In school.

503
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:49,754
- And you believed him?
- And punched in the stomach.

504
00:33:49,963 --> 00:33:51,923
Yeah, I believe him.
He said it's...

505
00:33:52,007 --> 00:33:53,090
He said it's tradition.

506
00:33:53,175 --> 00:33:55,718
I was told the very same thing
when I was your age.

507
00:33:55,802 --> 00:33:57,929
- That's the tradition.
- What is?

508
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:00,264
Putting the fear of God
into the first years.

509
00:34:00,349 --> 00:34:02,684
Nothing's gonna happen to you.

510
00:34:04,187 --> 00:34:06,730
Come on, then. Up you get.

511
00:34:08,691 --> 00:34:10,692
- Night.
- Good night.

512
00:34:14,072 --> 00:34:18,242
Dad, will you lie next to me
till I go to sleep?

513
00:34:26,751 --> 00:34:28,252
Dad!

514
00:34:57,533 --> 00:34:59,575
My God, Mike!

515
00:35:00,411 --> 00:35:04,914
- It's Mr Kiernan in school, Skunk.
- Oh.

516
00:35:04,999 --> 00:35:07,208
- Not Mike.
- Oh, right.

517
00:35:08,419 --> 00:35:11,212
Well, in that case
you can call me Miss Cunningham.

518
00:35:11,797 --> 00:35:13,965
Fair enough.

519
00:35:14,216 --> 00:35:16,467
Okay, everyone. My name is Mr Kiernan.

520
00:35:27,062 --> 00:35:28,813
Uh, Miss Cunningham.

521
00:35:28,897 --> 00:35:31,065
Yes, Mr Kiernan?

522
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:34,068
Um, how is Kasia?

523
00:35:34,153 --> 00:35:35,403
Kasia's fine.

524
00:35:36,405 --> 00:35:39,449
Will you, um, say hi to her for me?

525
00:35:39,575 --> 00:35:40,950
Do you have a message back?

526
00:35:41,452 --> 00:35:42,452
I do.

527
00:35:42,745 --> 00:35:43,911
Dick.

528
00:35:44,163 --> 00:35:45,163
Excuse me?

529
00:35:45,998 --> 00:35:47,666
It's what she said.

530
00:35:48,918 --> 00:35:50,169
How many did you get?

531
00:35:50,295 --> 00:35:51,920
- A hundred.
- Shit.

532
00:35:52,005 --> 00:35:53,422
And one of the long ones.

533
00:35:53,506 --> 00:35:55,257
"I must not use
inappropriate language..."

534
00:35:55,967 --> 00:35:57,801
What the hell did you just do that for?

535
00:35:57,886 --> 00:36:00,721
Sit down. Give me some money.

536
00:36:00,847 --> 00:36:02,556
- What?
- Some money.

537
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,099
- Why?
- 'Cause I want some.

538
00:36:04,184 --> 00:36:07,144
And if you don't, my sister's
gonna kick the fucking shit out of you.

539
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:10,397
- How much?
- All you got. Get it all out.

540
00:36:10,482 --> 00:36:11,815
You as well.

541
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:12,983
Go on, quick! Hurry up!

542
00:36:13,818 --> 00:36:18,155
Now, every week, from next week on,
I want £2 from each of you.

543
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:19,281
What?

544
00:36:19,366 --> 00:36:20,532
That's what it costs
to stay off the list.

545
00:36:20,617 --> 00:36:23,160
- What list?
- The list of fucking death, bitch.

546
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:27,581
Here's your shit fucking loser's
out-of-date fucking mobile.

547
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:30,876
- It's broken.
- What?

548
00:36:31,503 --> 00:36:35,714
The cow. The absolute fucking ugly...

549
00:36:36,132 --> 00:36:37,633
Go on.

550
00:36:38,593 --> 00:36:41,054
- How many did you get?
- Two hundred.

551
00:36:43,766 --> 00:36:45,558
Must be one of the bad ones.

552
00:36:47,228 --> 00:36:48,728
Can I get a new phone?

553
00:36:50,481 --> 00:36:52,315
- You've got a phone.
- It broke.

554
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,234
- Can I get a new one?
- No.

555
00:36:54,318 --> 00:36:55,527
Why not?

556
00:36:55,611 --> 00:36:57,570
You should have taken better care
of the old one.

557
00:36:59,949 --> 00:37:01,366
It would make me so happy.

558
00:37:01,617 --> 00:37:03,368
Quiet, Skunk.

559
00:37:04,578 --> 00:37:06,579
I'd just be the happiest child.

560
00:37:09,041 --> 00:37:10,458
I'm trying to work, love.

561
00:37:16,507 --> 00:37:18,591
# I'd be delirious! #

562
00:37:18,759 --> 00:37:20,844
It's just not fair.

563
00:37:20,928 --> 00:37:23,805
- I don't care.
- You don't care about me.

564
00:37:23,889 --> 00:37:25,682
Yeah, he doesn't care about me.

565
00:37:28,811 --> 00:37:30,353
Go away, Skunk!

566
00:37:30,438 --> 00:37:32,564
He hates me. That's what he said.

567
00:37:33,817 --> 00:37:34,984
- Please.
- Stop it.

568
00:37:35,068 --> 00:37:36,819
Please, Dad.

569
00:37:36,903 --> 00:37:39,071
- He wishes I was dead.
- What?

570
00:37:39,948 --> 00:37:41,615
Nothing.

571
00:37:43,118 --> 00:37:44,285
Please!

572
00:37:44,369 --> 00:37:46,203
Emily!

573
00:37:48,498 --> 00:37:50,332
I don't want to hear it again.

574
00:37:50,876 --> 00:37:52,376
Do you understand me?

575
00:37:52,919 --> 00:37:54,628
Do you understand me?!

576
00:37:57,799 --> 00:37:59,300
Emily.

577
00:38:17,694 --> 00:38:20,279
- What time is it?
- Ten past ten.

578
00:38:20,572 --> 00:38:22,573
Do you think he's learnt
his lesson yet?

579
00:38:22,657 --> 00:38:24,492
Who's this?

580
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:35,462
Susan Oswald.

581
00:38:36,964 --> 00:38:38,507
Slut.

582
00:38:38,966 --> 00:38:40,383
No, she's not.

583
00:38:43,262 --> 00:38:44,721
Told you.

584
00:38:48,142 --> 00:38:50,852
They call that fell-at-io.

585
00:38:55,691 --> 00:38:57,234
I have to go home.

586
00:39:01,197 --> 00:39:05,033
Where have you been?
Why didn't you call?

587
00:39:05,576 --> 00:39:07,410
I don't have a phone.

588
00:39:07,954 --> 00:39:12,624
You little brat!
How dare you do what you just did!

589
00:39:13,626 --> 00:39:15,168
Sit down!

590
00:39:23,387 --> 00:39:26,847
Yes, she's here. She's fine.

591
00:39:29,643 --> 00:39:31,018
Sorry, Dad.

592
00:39:55,210 --> 00:39:57,211
Dad.

593
00:39:57,671 --> 00:39:59,171
My levels are off.

594
00:40:01,883 --> 00:40:04,677
You can never forget
how important this is.

595
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,845
I know.

596
00:40:07,264 --> 00:40:10,558
I know it's routine,
I know it's hard...

597
00:40:11,518 --> 00:40:13,687
- Say it's okay, Dad.
- What?

598
00:40:14,522 --> 00:40:16,189
I said I was sorry.

599
00:40:17,025 --> 00:40:19,192
Now you have to say it's okay.

600
00:40:29,203 --> 00:40:30,454
It's okay.

601
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:39,588
What would you do if I died, Dad?

602
00:40:41,633 --> 00:40:43,800
I can't even answer that question.

603
00:40:43,885 --> 00:40:45,385
Would you cry?

604
00:40:45,428 --> 00:40:46,595
Uh-huh.

605
00:40:46,721 --> 00:40:48,055
A lot?

606
00:40:48,097 --> 00:40:50,098
I don't think I'd ever stop.

607
00:40:50,308 --> 00:40:51,642
What if I...

608
00:40:59,776 --> 00:41:01,652
Stop!

609
00:41:01,903 --> 00:41:03,320
- No.
- Get off!

610
00:41:03,404 --> 00:41:04,739
Get off!

611
00:41:07,618 --> 00:41:10,578
- Tell about the night I was born.
- No.

612
00:41:11,121 --> 00:41:13,164
- Go on.
- I don't know. Why?

613
00:41:13,248 --> 00:41:16,084
- The night, or the...
- The dream.

614
00:41:16,669 --> 00:41:18,419
- Please. Come on.
- No. Not again.

615
00:41:18,504 --> 00:41:20,088
- Tell me.
- Why do you...

616
00:41:20,172 --> 00:41:23,007
- I don't even know why you like this.
- I just do. Come on.

617
00:41:24,176 --> 00:41:27,428
- All right, well, it's about this woman.
- Mm-hm.

618
00:41:27,513 --> 00:41:30,515
- And different times in her life.
- Different moments. Yes.

619
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:32,141
- Different moments.
- Like what?

620
00:41:32,267 --> 00:41:34,185
- I can't remember.
- Think.

621
00:41:34,269 --> 00:41:36,145
- I can't remember.
- Try.

622
00:41:38,607 --> 00:41:42,193
- Um... Well, some of them are sad.
- Hmm.

623
00:41:43,195 --> 00:41:45,154
- But most of them are happy.
- Hmm.

624
00:41:45,989 --> 00:41:47,782
And the woman was me.

625
00:41:47,866 --> 00:41:49,283
And the woman was you.

626
00:41:49,785 --> 00:41:51,703
And the dream was my future.

627
00:41:51,787 --> 00:41:53,121
I don't know about that.

628
00:41:53,163 --> 00:41:56,290
I mean, that's what it felt like,
yeah, but, yeah...

629
00:41:58,002 --> 00:42:00,003
But what did I look like?

630
00:42:01,673 --> 00:42:02,965
Hideous.

631
00:42:03,717 --> 00:42:05,342
You're nice.

632
00:42:05,468 --> 00:42:06,719
Stunning.

633
00:42:07,637 --> 00:42:09,138
And then you woke.

634
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:12,725
And then I woke, and I was happy
and I was sad all at the same time.

635
00:42:12,809 --> 00:42:14,309
And Mum was there.

636
00:42:14,686 --> 00:42:17,020
She was the one that woke me up.

637
00:42:18,022 --> 00:42:19,648
And she said...

638
00:42:19,983 --> 00:42:22,484
"Archie, she's here."

639
00:42:23,987 --> 00:42:25,738
- Meaning me.
- Meaning you.

640
00:42:25,822 --> 00:42:27,364
Well, you were the one
about to be born, weren't you?

641
00:42:31,661 --> 00:42:33,078
Oh, Skunk.

642
00:42:33,163 --> 00:42:35,581
- I can't help it.
- I know.

643
00:42:42,338 --> 00:42:45,257
You're such a strange girl.

644
00:43:00,107 --> 00:43:01,441
Wah!

645
00:43:01,525 --> 00:43:03,359
Come on, let's get this done.

646
00:43:08,616 --> 00:43:11,242
Here, you do it.

647
00:43:25,049 --> 00:43:30,220
# Looking up at monsters
in the clouds

648
00:43:31,722 --> 00:43:34,933
# Red's the colour when you're dead

649
00:43:35,434 --> 00:43:38,812
# Find me gone, I'm just in bed

650
00:43:39,563 --> 00:43:42,607
# Reading up on fairy tales... #

651
00:43:47,322 --> 00:43:49,573
Skunk, we can go in now, love.

652
00:43:54,287 --> 00:43:55,913
- Hi, Skunk.
- Hi.

653
00:43:57,916 --> 00:43:59,416
Why don't you sit
down there, Skunk?

654
00:43:59,459 --> 00:44:00,918
Okay.

655
00:44:02,629 --> 00:44:05,464
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

656
00:44:05,590 --> 00:44:08,926
- Why are you talking like that?
- It's his medication.

657
00:44:09,010 --> 00:44:12,805
- Talking like what?
- Kind of groggy.

658
00:44:14,766 --> 00:44:15,850
Am I?

659
00:44:19,938 --> 00:44:21,647
Wow. You've got your own telly and all.

660
00:44:21,773 --> 00:44:24,316
Oh, yeah. You know, I...
I watch, um...

661
00:44:33,618 --> 00:44:36,287
- I'm sorry.
- No, no.

662
00:44:37,790 --> 00:44:40,041
- How's school?
- It's fine.

663
00:44:40,126 --> 00:44:41,376
We're actually on a half day today.

664
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:43,378
- Isn't she good to come, Rick?
- Yes, she is.

665
00:44:43,462 --> 00:44:45,714
- She asked to, you know.
- She's really good.

666
00:44:46,632 --> 00:44:49,384
I always thought
Skunk was really good, didn't I?

667
00:44:49,468 --> 00:44:50,844
- Uh-huh.
- I don't know.

668
00:44:54,724 --> 00:44:56,516
What was it like?

669
00:44:56,976 --> 00:44:58,184
Hmm?

670
00:44:58,311 --> 00:44:59,394
You know,
when you went kind of mad?

671
00:44:59,979 --> 00:45:02,689
- That's...
- Is it all right if I say that?

672
00:45:07,153 --> 00:45:09,863
Actually, it's really hard to describe.

673
00:45:11,490 --> 00:45:15,911
But it's kind of like
there was a toxic cloud.

674
00:45:16,495 --> 00:45:18,580
- A toxic cloud?
- Yeah, or a...

675
00:45:19,165 --> 00:45:22,375
a mist of evil or something.

676
00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:23,752
Really?

677
00:45:24,378 --> 00:45:25,921
- Or badness.
- Wow.

678
00:45:26,005 --> 00:45:27,839
Yeah.

679
00:45:28,424 --> 00:45:29,550
Is it there right now?

680
00:45:30,844 --> 00:45:32,428
Uh... Less.

681
00:45:32,512 --> 00:45:34,597
In fact, Dr Sinclair was saying
at this rate of improvement,

682
00:45:34,681 --> 00:45:36,182
Rick might be able to come home
for the weekend.

683
00:45:36,224 --> 00:45:37,516
- Isn't that right, son?
- When?

684
00:45:37,601 --> 00:45:39,518
- Not, not now.
- No, no, no.

685
00:45:39,561 --> 00:45:40,728
- No, not now.
- No, not now.

686
00:45:40,854 --> 00:45:42,229
But soon.

687
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:52,198
Il had an uncle who was
a nutter like that.

688
00:45:52,282 --> 00:45:54,408
- Thought he had worms in his hair.
- Oh, yeah?

689
00:45:54,534 --> 00:45:56,535
Yeah, like nesting there.

690
00:45:57,245 --> 00:46:00,247
Shaved it all off.
Been bald ever since.

691
00:46:00,374 --> 00:46:03,542
- Is he better, though?
- No, he's worse.

692
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:06,879
He lives in Florida now.
D'you know, they have lizards there.

693
00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:10,049
- What?
- Lizards, millions of 'em,

694
00:46:10,133 --> 00:46:12,218
just walking round the streets.

695
00:46:12,302 --> 00:46:13,886
"Hey, how you doin'?"

696
00:46:15,389 --> 00:46:17,598
You and I should go sometime,
d'you know that?

697
00:46:17,724 --> 00:46:18,808
When?

698
00:46:19,226 --> 00:46:21,560
I don't know. One day.

699
00:46:22,772 --> 00:46:24,439
Why? Would you come
if I asked you to?

700
00:46:24,565 --> 00:46:25,649
Yeah.

701
00:46:25,733 --> 00:46:27,401
What about that guy
you're in love with?

702
00:46:27,443 --> 00:46:29,403
- Mike.
- That teacher.

703
00:46:29,487 --> 00:46:32,406
He'd understand.
I'm in love with you as well.

704
00:46:33,116 --> 00:46:35,575
Sweet. They call that a
"Ménage à trois."

705
00:46:36,077 --> 00:46:37,119
What does that mean?

706
00:46:37,245 --> 00:46:38,578
Love triangle.

707
00:46:38,663 --> 00:46:40,414
- Give us a kiss.
- No.

708
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:50,424
Nice one.

709
00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:01,184
I don't know. It was like...

710
00:47:01,269 --> 00:47:04,688
I think he just switched off
or something. Click.

711
00:47:05,273 --> 00:47:08,942
Click and he just wasn't there
any more.

712
00:47:09,777 --> 00:47:11,111
Hello, fatty.

713
00:47:11,529 --> 00:47:12,863
I haven't got it.

714
00:47:13,698 --> 00:47:14,823
You haven't got it?

715
00:47:14,949 --> 00:47:18,369
- Are you fucking joking?
- Let me go.

716
00:47:18,454 --> 00:47:19,871
Let go!

717
00:47:23,333 --> 00:47:27,462
- Fucking laughing?
- No. I'm sorry, Sunrise.

718
00:47:27,629 --> 00:47:28,671
Bitch, you're gone!

719
00:47:28,797 --> 00:47:29,964
History, yeah?

720
00:47:30,007 --> 00:47:34,469
You're now officially on the list.
Just you fucking wait!

721
00:47:34,511 --> 00:47:36,137
Dumpy little turd.

722
00:47:39,391 --> 00:47:40,558
Does he die?

723
00:47:40,726 --> 00:47:41,893
I can't tell you if he dies or not

724
00:47:41,977 --> 00:47:44,520
because that's why we read,
to find out, okay?

725
00:47:44,646 --> 00:47:46,689
But let's just all agree
there is a chance

726
00:47:46,815 --> 00:47:48,566
that he may die, all right?

727
00:47:48,650 --> 00:47:50,318
- I don't want him to.
- All right.

728
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:53,237
Now, why do we think
he goes on? Kevin?

729
00:47:53,322 --> 00:47:54,489
Well, his life was rubbish, weren't it?

730
00:47:54,531 --> 00:47:55,823
And boring.

731
00:47:56,075 --> 00:47:57,992
Whereas through the doors
there could be wicked shit.

732
00:47:58,077 --> 00:48:00,495
- Like dragons.
- Like dragons and shit.

733
00:48:00,537 --> 00:48:02,205
- Trolls.
- Yeah, like teachers.

734
00:48:04,583 --> 00:48:05,917
Everyone, just wait, wait.

735
00:48:06,001 --> 00:48:07,543
That, what Kevin said,

736
00:48:07,878 --> 00:48:11,173
is the definition of courage. Right?

737
00:48:11,257 --> 00:48:12,841
Being afraid...

738
00:48:15,386 --> 00:48:17,513
but doing it anyway.

739
00:48:17,597 --> 00:48:19,515
- I still would not go.
- 'Course you wouldn't go.

740
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:21,058
I wouldn't want to die.

741
00:48:22,102 --> 00:48:24,895
- He doesn't die, Vikram.
- You told me the end!

742
00:48:25,021 --> 00:48:26,396
Why did you have to ruin it?

743
00:48:26,523 --> 00:48:29,024
Why? Why?

744
00:49:04,228 --> 00:49:05,728
You all right?

745
00:49:14,905 --> 00:49:17,073
- Please...
- Frigid slut.

746
00:49:17,324 --> 00:49:18,408
- Please.
- Hold her.

747
00:49:18,576 --> 00:49:19,909
I'm trying.

748
00:49:21,787 --> 00:49:24,247
- Well, kick her while she's
down, then. - I am!

749
00:49:24,290 --> 00:49:26,332
- Properly, in the ribs.
- I am! Watch! I am!

750
00:49:26,417 --> 00:49:28,585
- Do it harder than that.
- God, shut up!

751
00:49:28,627 --> 00:49:29,794
Do it in the ribs, not the arm.

752
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:32,255
- Shut up! I'll kick you next time!
- Harder!

753
00:49:32,339 --> 00:49:34,591
- What you doing?
- What the hell is going on here?

754
00:49:34,633 --> 00:49:35,675
Come on.

755
00:49:35,926 --> 00:49:37,343
Skunk, you all right?

756
00:49:37,428 --> 00:49:39,762
Listen, if you fucking touch me
like that again, I'll report you.

757
00:49:39,805 --> 00:49:40,847
- Oh, you'll report me, will you?
- Yeah.

758
00:49:40,931 --> 00:49:42,432
How old are you? Come on!

759
00:49:42,516 --> 00:49:44,100
- She's half your size.
- Oh, fuck off, you paedo.

760
00:49:44,185 --> 00:49:45,602
Go on, get out of here.
Get out of my sight.

761
00:49:45,644 --> 00:49:47,854
- Hey, Sunrise, get back here.
- What are you doing? That's my sister.

762
00:49:47,938 --> 00:49:49,355
- Stay right there.
- Don't talk to my sister like that.

763
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:50,481
Come here.

764
00:49:50,608 --> 00:49:52,275
- Fucking queer.
- Down there. Stand down there.

765
00:49:52,359 --> 00:49:54,028
- You, be quiet.
- Why are you listening to him for?

766
00:49:54,112 --> 00:49:56,197
- He's a teacher, Sas.
- Yeah, just get out of here!

767
00:49:56,781 --> 00:50:00,201
For the next two weeks,
you're gonna come here for...

768
00:50:00,285 --> 00:50:02,620
- Yeah, right.
- Sunrise, look at me.

769
00:50:05,498 --> 00:50:08,792
For an hour and a half's detention
after school, starting tomorrow.

770
00:50:09,628 --> 00:50:18,052
Do you understand?

771
00:50:19,804 --> 00:50:22,640
Good. Go home.

772
00:50:27,896 --> 00:50:29,647
She had a bit of a run-in
with another girl,

773
00:50:29,731 --> 00:50:31,732
but we sorted it out
and everything's fine,

774
00:50:31,816 --> 00:50:33,734
so don't worry, it's...

775
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:35,986
Mike rescued me.

776
00:50:36,071 --> 00:50:37,696
- Really?
- Hmm.

777
00:50:39,407 --> 00:50:41,659
- Can I have a jam sandwich?
- Okay.

778
00:50:43,578 --> 00:50:45,746
Go change out of your uniform first.

779
00:50:55,174 --> 00:50:57,217
Here, I'll... I'll get that.

780
00:51:00,429 --> 00:51:02,514
Butter...

781
00:51:15,361 --> 00:51:17,737
You know, it's kind of weird, isn't it,

782
00:51:17,863 --> 00:51:19,781
when you're in the middle of something,

783
00:51:19,865 --> 00:51:23,910
how things can be
so, uh, confusing, you know?

784
00:51:24,036 --> 00:51:25,620
- Unclear.
- What are you talking about?

785
00:51:25,705 --> 00:51:28,623
No. Whereas, you know,
what I'm saying is,

786
00:51:28,708 --> 00:51:34,212
whereas with a bit of time and
a bit of distance and perspective,

787
00:51:34,255 --> 00:51:35,880
things kind of...

788
00:51:39,928 --> 00:51:42,805
Look, whatever you want...

789
00:51:43,390 --> 00:51:44,557
Sorry?

790
00:51:44,975 --> 00:51:48,102
A house, a baby,

791
00:51:48,228 --> 00:51:51,147
whatever you want, I'll give you.

792
00:51:54,568 --> 00:51:56,402
- That's very kind of you, Mike.
- That's what I'm saying.

793
00:51:56,445 --> 00:51:58,571
It took me, I don't know,
stepping away...

794
00:51:58,613 --> 00:51:59,739
To get a perspective.

795
00:51:59,781 --> 00:52:03,409
Yes, and to realise
that the things that you want, Kasia,

796
00:52:03,493 --> 00:52:06,454
the things that you want are,
are the things that I want.

797
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:09,123
Mike, I'm with Archie now.

798
00:52:11,918 --> 00:52:13,252
I'm sorry.

799
00:52:14,087 --> 00:52:16,339
You're with fucking Ar... Archie?

800
00:52:16,757 --> 00:52:18,007
Yes.

801
00:52:18,091 --> 00:52:19,425
As lovers?

802
00:52:21,928 --> 00:52:25,431
Well, what? Are you in love?

803
00:52:26,933 --> 00:52:28,684
Yes.

804
00:52:31,021 --> 00:52:33,774
Well, I'm s... I'm so fucking...
I'm happy for you.

805
00:52:33,816 --> 00:52:35,817
I'm so fucking happy for you!

806
00:52:36,694 --> 00:52:38,779
Mike. Mike?

807
00:52:38,863 --> 00:52:42,366
# When I'm really old, one day

808
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:45,869
# One day, when I'm really old

809
00:52:45,953 --> 00:52:49,456
# And when my hair falls out

810
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:54,127
# I'll stick it back with a spoon

811
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:58,006
# Of the marmalade that you made

812
00:52:58,132 --> 00:52:59,299
Mike!

813
00:53:25,661 --> 00:53:26,994
What the fuck?

814
00:53:27,079 --> 00:53:31,499
# When I'm really old, one day

815
00:53:31,542 --> 00:53:34,001
# One day, when I'm really old

816
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:37,171
# We won't care who's winning

817
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:41,175
# Our wrinkles will
stretch to the moon

818
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:45,763
# When I'm really old, one day... #

819
00:53:57,025 --> 00:54:00,194
- What the fuck?
- Skunk.

820
00:54:03,198 --> 00:54:05,741
- What were you doing?
- You know what.

821
00:54:05,868 --> 00:54:07,243
Why?

822
00:54:08,537 --> 00:54:10,204
- I don't know.
- Why her?

823
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:12,039
I don't know!

824
00:54:12,875 --> 00:54:14,876
Just promise you won't tell anyone.

825
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:17,712
All right. I just really...

826
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:19,882
- You haven't promised.
- I promise.

827
00:54:27,223 --> 00:54:30,559
I just don't understand
why people would do that.

828
00:54:31,603 --> 00:54:34,438
- It's what you do when you're in love.
- You're in love?

829
00:54:34,939 --> 00:54:37,441
Well, I am. I don't know about her.

830
00:54:38,067 --> 00:54:40,444
- What if she's pregnant?
- She's not...

831
00:54:40,570 --> 00:54:41,737
- Well, what if?
- Skunk!

832
00:54:41,779 --> 00:54:43,447
Whose could it be?

833
00:54:43,781 --> 00:54:46,450
- Simon Malloy's.
- Okay.

834
00:54:46,576 --> 00:54:48,410
Jed Cunningham. Dennis Woods.

835
00:54:48,495 --> 00:54:50,078
Jed Cunningham?

836
00:54:50,163 --> 00:54:51,497
- Yeah.
- Ugh.

837
00:54:51,748 --> 00:54:52,998
Who else?

838
00:54:53,416 --> 00:54:55,417
A couple of guys,
I can't remember their names.

839
00:54:56,252 --> 00:54:58,921
- Who's that one with the dreadlocks?
- Brian Williams.

840
00:54:59,088 --> 00:55:01,924
- He's gonna fucking kill me, Sunrise!
- Shut up!

841
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:05,969
Just let me think.

842
00:55:21,362 --> 00:55:23,613
And when's the last time
you saw Miss Oswald?

843
00:55:24,782 --> 00:55:26,616
Uh... Last Tuesday.

844
00:55:27,618 --> 00:55:28,785
Where?

845
00:55:29,328 --> 00:55:30,787
Outside the school.

846
00:55:30,829 --> 00:55:36,125
Uh, she was attacking another child,
so I had to...

847
00:55:37,836 --> 00:55:40,797
Sorry, did you say Sunrise?

848
00:55:41,674 --> 00:55:44,551
- Sorry?
- Um, Sunrise Oswald?

849
00:55:45,386 --> 00:55:46,553
Susan.

850
00:55:46,637 --> 00:55:48,680
- What did we say?
- Susan.

851
00:55:48,806 --> 00:55:51,724
Oh, right, sorry,
'cause I don't know Susan.

852
00:55:52,184 --> 00:55:54,561
It was Sunrise who I reprimanded.

853
00:55:54,895 --> 00:55:57,355
- You don't know her?
- No.

854
00:55:57,481 --> 00:55:59,566
Well, I mean, I know her,
she's in the school,

855
00:55:59,650 --> 00:56:02,485
but I've never had
any contact with her.

856
00:56:04,739 --> 00:56:06,073
I see.

857
00:56:06,157 --> 00:56:07,575
Well, she claims
you've been having an affair.

858
00:56:11,162 --> 00:56:12,663
What?

859
00:56:17,669 --> 00:56:20,004
Well, that's insane. She's a child.

860
00:56:20,046 --> 00:56:22,089
She's 14 years old, Mr Kiernan.

861
00:56:22,549 --> 00:56:24,008
She's also pregnant.

862
00:56:33,685 --> 00:56:36,520
- Mr Kiernan?
- Can I help you?

863
00:56:37,230 --> 00:56:38,439
- Mr Kiernan?
- Yes.

864
00:56:43,069 --> 00:56:44,695
- It's all right, don't worry.
- Everybody, get out!

865
00:56:50,577 --> 00:56:52,036
Kids, out!

866
00:57:11,390 --> 00:57:12,557
Mike.

867
00:57:15,561 --> 00:57:17,729
They're coming, Dad!

868
00:57:19,106 --> 00:57:20,774
All right, all right, all right.

869
00:57:21,233 --> 00:57:23,735
Now, you know I'll be back, yeah?

870
00:57:23,778 --> 00:57:25,779
You know I'll make sure
everything's all right, yeah?

871
00:57:25,905 --> 00:57:28,156
- I love you so fucking much.
- Dad.

872
00:57:28,908 --> 00:57:30,075
Oh, thanks, love.

873
00:57:30,159 --> 00:57:34,162
And I love you so much, yeah?
Give us a kiss.

874
00:57:34,789 --> 00:57:37,082
Come here, come here. Come here.

875
00:57:37,124 --> 00:57:40,085
Oh, come on. Let's do a big
family fucking hug, yeah?

876
00:57:40,127 --> 00:57:41,586
- I love you, Dad.
- I love you so much.

877
00:57:41,671 --> 00:57:44,005
- I love you, Dad. I love you.
- I love you, I love you, I love you.

878
00:57:44,965 --> 00:57:46,841
I love you, I love you, I love you.

879
00:57:46,926 --> 00:57:48,843
I love you, I love you, I love you.
I love you, I love you.

880
00:57:48,928 --> 00:57:50,471
I love you, Dad.

881
00:57:53,809 --> 00:57:54,975
Can you not cause a scene, all right?

882
00:57:55,102 --> 00:57:57,103
Saskia, no boys, all right? No parties.

883
00:57:57,187 --> 00:57:59,438
Oh, fuck off.

884
00:57:59,523 --> 00:58:00,856
Fuck off, you cunt!

885
00:58:04,361 --> 00:58:07,488
- Girls, get back inside.
- Get the fuck out of here!

886
00:58:14,371 --> 00:58:16,455
I've a right to call a solicitor,
don't I?

887
00:58:16,665 --> 00:58:19,458
- Yes.
- I'd like to do that now.

888
00:58:20,669 --> 00:58:25,131
Sorry. Uh... Mr Kiernan's
solicitor's here.

889
00:58:29,970 --> 00:58:32,304
- So this is alleged?
- Yes.

890
00:58:33,515 --> 00:58:34,974
You haven't arrested my client?

891
00:58:35,058 --> 00:58:38,018
For the moment, he's helping
us with our inquiries.

892
00:58:38,228 --> 00:58:40,479
- Get your jacket on.
- Wait a minute.

893
00:58:40,564 --> 00:58:41,981
- No. She's a liar.
- What?

894
00:58:42,023 --> 00:58:43,817
She's done this type
of thing before.

895
00:58:43,901 --> 00:58:46,737
Another man,
another accusation, essentially of rape.

896
00:58:47,822 --> 00:58:49,865
Another lie.

897
00:58:49,991 --> 00:58:52,409
Look it up, Detective.

898
00:58:52,744 --> 00:58:54,327
So you have a decision to make.

899
00:58:54,412 --> 00:58:58,498
Either you release my client or...
you arrest him.

900
00:58:58,541 --> 00:59:02,169
And then we'll take this matter further
as her story falls apart.

901
00:59:08,176 --> 00:59:09,676
Thank you.

902
00:59:13,890 --> 00:59:16,224
You can thank Kasia.

903
00:59:17,685 --> 00:59:19,269
She's the one that asked me to...

904
00:59:19,353 --> 00:59:20,937
Right.

905
00:59:21,022 --> 00:59:23,356
- ...come in for you.
- Yeah. How are you two doing?

906
00:59:25,902 --> 00:59:27,527
Well, I don't really
want to talk about that.

907
00:59:27,570 --> 00:59:30,697
- Oh. Don't you?
- No.

908
00:59:30,782 --> 00:59:33,033
Why is that, Archie?

909
00:59:33,117 --> 00:59:35,702
Is that because what you have
is so fucking special

910
00:59:35,787 --> 00:59:37,079
it can't be articulated, huh?

911
00:59:37,206 --> 00:59:38,915
No, it's because
it's none of your business.

912
00:59:39,041 --> 00:59:40,124
Fuck you.

913
00:59:40,542 --> 00:59:42,543
You know what? Fuck you.

914
00:59:43,545 --> 00:59:47,381
The last thing I need beyond
losing the woman that I love

915
00:59:47,466 --> 00:59:50,259
is to be obliged to the man
who fucking stole her.

916
00:59:50,385 --> 00:59:52,053
- Well, I didn't steal her...
- Yeah, well, you fuck...

917
00:59:52,137 --> 00:59:53,387
And there's no obligation.

918
00:59:53,472 --> 00:59:54,722
Oh, fuck off, Archie!

919
00:59:55,057 --> 00:59:58,226
Man, you couldn't be
more fucking patronising if you tried.

920
01:00:02,606 --> 01:00:04,315
- Then what?
- I don't know, love.

921
01:00:04,399 --> 01:00:06,400
They'll probably give him
some kind of DNA test.

922
01:00:06,443 --> 01:00:07,902
- Right.
- Right.

923
01:00:07,986 --> 01:00:10,112
- You know what that is, do you?
- Yes.

924
01:00:11,490 --> 01:00:12,907
- No.
- It's a test

925
01:00:12,991 --> 01:00:16,077
- that'll show he isn't the father.
- But he isn't the father!

926
01:00:16,119 --> 01:00:17,578
- We know that, love.
- She's a liar.

927
01:00:17,663 --> 01:00:20,081
Everyone knows she's done it with...

928
01:00:21,625 --> 01:00:22,959
lots of boys.

929
01:00:23,085 --> 01:00:25,002
- It doesn't matter, Skunk.
- Why not?

930
01:00:25,087 --> 01:00:26,254
Because they're boys.

931
01:00:26,505 --> 01:00:28,506
Mike is an adult. You understand?

932
01:00:28,590 --> 01:00:30,676
A teacher. In this kind of situation,

933
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:33,512
they have to be absolutely sure
of his innocence.

934
01:00:35,098 --> 01:00:39,351
And until they are, they just can't
allow him to work with children.

935
01:00:39,435 --> 01:00:41,645
- So he's not coming back?
- Not at the moment, no.

936
01:00:43,481 --> 01:00:44,857
Sorry, love.

937
01:00:46,109 --> 01:00:48,318
Skunk, it's your boyfriend.

938
01:00:49,112 --> 01:00:50,195
Birmingham?

939
01:00:51,614 --> 01:00:55,450
But I thought... I thought you and
me were gonna go to Florida

940
01:00:55,535 --> 01:00:58,453
- and see... see the lizards and stuff.
- Yeah, I know, but...

941
01:00:58,496 --> 01:01:00,122
That was when we were older.

942
01:01:00,164 --> 01:01:01,790
Why not now, though?

943
01:01:01,833 --> 01:01:04,960
Because my aunt says
I have to go to Birmingham, Skunk.

944
01:01:05,044 --> 01:01:07,129
What am I gonna do without you?

945
01:01:10,884 --> 01:01:12,885
Here.

946
01:01:13,803 --> 01:01:16,972
- Will you take this?
- Why should I?

947
01:01:17,974 --> 01:01:20,058
To remember me by.

948
01:01:23,814 --> 01:01:25,815
When do you go?

949
01:01:26,525 --> 01:01:28,151
Tomorrow.

950
01:01:29,820 --> 01:01:32,655
Early. So I'm not
gonna get to see you again.

951
01:01:32,740 --> 01:01:34,657
How long did you know that?

952
01:01:37,161 --> 01:01:38,703
How long did you know, Dillon?!

953
01:01:38,829 --> 01:01:40,496
- Skunk.
- You're only telling me now!

954
01:01:40,539 --> 01:01:42,165
- Why haven't you told me?!
- Skunk, stop.

955
01:01:42,249 --> 01:01:43,333
You're an arsehole, Dillon.

956
01:01:43,417 --> 01:01:45,335
I wanted to tell you,
but I was afraid to.

957
01:01:46,253 --> 01:01:48,046
Please don't hate me.

958
01:01:48,172 --> 01:01:50,006
You're leaving me, Dillon.

959
01:01:50,507 --> 01:01:52,342
'Course I hate you.

960
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:54,510
I'll always hate you!

961
01:01:56,013 --> 01:01:58,514
Oh, it's lopsided.

962
01:01:58,599 --> 01:02:00,266
- It's okay.
- No, it's not.

963
01:02:00,351 --> 01:02:01,392
It's fine.

964
01:02:01,685 --> 01:02:02,852
Fine?

965
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:05,855
Well, I wanted it to be perfect.

966
01:02:06,607 --> 01:02:08,232
Is it edible?

967
01:02:09,526 --> 01:02:11,903
Well, of course it is.

968
01:02:12,029 --> 01:02:15,366
- Dave!
- Well, the message is...

969
01:02:15,408 --> 01:02:17,910
is clear enough.
That's all you want really, isn't it?

970
01:02:18,036 --> 01:02:21,580
Yeah, well... I suppose.

971
01:02:23,917 --> 01:02:25,542
Well, I'd better go.

972
01:02:25,585 --> 01:02:26,710
Hmm.

973
01:02:27,212 --> 01:02:28,253
He'll love it, Janet.

974
01:02:28,630 --> 01:02:29,755
Hmm.

975
01:03:03,164 --> 01:03:04,790
- Fuck off.
- Oi!

976
01:03:19,515 --> 01:03:22,600
Fuck off.

977
01:03:22,685 --> 01:03:24,769
Is anyone gonna get that?

978
01:03:24,854 --> 01:03:26,146
Saskia.

979
01:03:26,272 --> 01:03:27,772
You get it.

980
01:03:33,279 --> 01:03:35,321
Saskia. Saskia!

981
01:03:42,621 --> 01:03:44,706
- Yeah?
- All right?

982
01:03:45,458 --> 01:03:46,958
Can I ask you something?

983
01:03:47,001 --> 01:03:48,626
- What is it?
- Um...

984
01:03:50,212 --> 01:03:52,881
I just wanted you to know that,
if you wanted me to,

985
01:03:52,965 --> 01:03:54,632
I'd be the daddy.

986
01:03:55,051 --> 01:03:58,219
- The what?
- The... the dad.

987
01:03:58,471 --> 01:04:01,807
Uh... Of the baby.
T-Take responsibility for it.

988
01:04:02,392 --> 01:04:04,018
- You and me, we could get married.
- Jesus Christ.

989
01:04:04,144 --> 01:04:07,229
- Are you being serious?
- Yeah.

990
01:04:07,314 --> 01:04:10,066
Jed, we're having
a party in here, all right?

991
01:04:10,150 --> 01:04:13,319
- Just don't call over again.
- But...

992
01:04:27,501 --> 01:04:30,086
Skunk? Are you okay?

993
01:04:31,588 --> 01:04:34,924
Why didn't you tell me and Jed
about you and Kasia?

994
01:04:40,388 --> 01:04:42,389
I'm sorry.

995
01:04:43,350 --> 01:04:46,102
- I was trying to find the right moment.
- Are you gonna marry her?

996
01:04:46,186 --> 01:04:49,021
- I don't know.
- Kasia, I know you're there!

997
01:04:49,898 --> 01:04:51,023
- Are you?
- I don't know, love.

998
01:04:51,108 --> 01:04:53,400
Because she'll leave us, Dad,
the way she left Mike.

999
01:04:53,527 --> 01:04:55,695
Like Mum left us. Like everyone does.

1000
01:04:55,738 --> 01:04:58,532
- No, I won't.
- Yes, you will! Don't lie.

1001
01:04:58,574 --> 01:05:01,409
It'll all go wrong, Dad.
Everything always goes wrong.

1002
01:05:01,536 --> 01:05:03,745
- Why do only bad things happen?
- Good things happen.

1003
01:05:03,871 --> 01:05:05,539
Like what, your sex with Kasia?

1004
01:05:05,623 --> 01:05:09,793
- Skunk, listen. - What about
me or Jed or Rick or Mike?

1005
01:05:09,877 --> 01:05:12,087
- What about Mike, Kasia?
- Skunk, you need to stop.

1006
01:05:12,213 --> 01:05:16,091
I don't want to talk to either of you.
Just get out! It's my room!

1007
01:05:16,425 --> 01:05:18,135
So let's, as much as we can,

1008
01:05:18,219 --> 01:05:20,428
confine things to the home
for the weekend, okay?

1009
01:05:20,555 --> 01:05:22,806
- Yes. - Just to be safe
this first time out.

1010
01:05:22,890 --> 01:05:24,599
- Thank you, Doctor. Yes.
- Not at all.

1011
01:05:24,725 --> 01:05:25,934
- Best of luck, Rick.
- Thank you.

1012
01:05:26,060 --> 01:05:27,561
Have a great weekend.

1013
01:06:08,187 --> 01:06:12,356
Susan. Susan. Susan?

1014
01:06:12,441 --> 01:06:14,150
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1015
01:06:14,276 --> 01:06:16,611
Susan. Susan!

1016
01:06:16,945 --> 01:06:18,863
There's blood everywhere.
Why is there blood everywhere?

1017
01:06:18,947 --> 01:06:21,782
Call an ambulance!
Call an ambulance!

1018
01:06:21,825 --> 01:06:24,994
- Susan!
- Call a fucking ambulance!

1019
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:28,206
- What's the fucking number?
- 999, you twat!

1020
01:06:28,957 --> 01:06:31,542
I wonder if she means we
can't have a kick-about.

1021
01:06:31,627 --> 01:06:32,710
Hmm.

1022
01:06:32,794 --> 01:06:34,045
Wouldn't mind
a bit of a kick-about, eh, Rick?

1023
01:06:35,797 --> 01:06:37,798
I think I'd rather stay inside, Dad.

1024
01:06:37,841 --> 01:06:42,054
Oh, well, yes, you're probably right.
Best to... Best to play by the book.

1025
01:06:42,472 --> 01:06:48,310
Oh, Mum's made a cake that's...
It's... It's a bit lopsided.

1026
01:06:48,519 --> 01:06:51,521
Just, uh, thought
I should warn you.

1027
01:06:54,984 --> 01:06:59,154
Well, what's going on here?
Nothing changes.

1028
01:06:59,197 --> 01:07:02,115
Well, we won't let it bother us, huh?

1029
01:07:08,706 --> 01:07:12,042
Hello, my baby. Hello.

1030
01:07:12,168 --> 01:07:14,336
What's... What's happening?

1031
01:07:14,462 --> 01:07:16,964
Oh, just don't pay any attention.
Um... What are you doing?

1032
01:07:17,006 --> 01:07:18,548
Well, I've got to...
I forgot the milk,

1033
01:07:18,675 --> 01:07:20,509
so just put the kettle on,
I won't be long.

1034
01:07:20,635 --> 01:07:22,844
- Why isn't she talking?
- Let's just get her in the ambulance.

1035
01:07:22,929 --> 01:07:25,222
- She's not even moving.
- Move out the way, please.

1036
01:07:25,348 --> 01:07:26,682
Just hurry up and
get her in there.

1037
01:07:26,766 --> 01:07:28,267
Just tell them.

1038
01:07:28,601 --> 01:07:30,686
Rick. Come on, Rick.
Just... Just come inside.

1039
01:07:30,770 --> 01:07:33,606
There's nothing going on there
that's of any interest. Come on.

1040
01:07:34,275 --> 01:07:35,358
You getting a good look, are you?

1041
01:07:35,442 --> 01:07:37,360
Right, let's go in. Let's go in.

1042
01:07:37,403 --> 01:07:38,778
- Pervert!
- Rick, come on...

1043
01:07:38,862 --> 01:07:40,905
It's 'cause of fucking scum like
you that this is happening.

1044
01:07:41,031 --> 01:07:43,408
- Just go inside.
- You sicko!

1045
01:07:43,534 --> 01:07:45,743
Go on, just piss off inside,
you fucking pervert!

1046
01:07:46,870 --> 01:07:48,079
Fucking evil bastard!

1047
01:07:50,708 --> 01:07:51,791
You sick...

1048
01:07:58,716 --> 01:08:00,300
Cup of tea, love?

1049
01:08:03,304 --> 01:08:04,304
Hmm?

1050
01:08:08,642 --> 01:08:10,643
Where are you going?

1051
01:08:11,812 --> 01:08:14,564
- To... To my room.
- But...

1052
01:08:15,399 --> 01:08:18,568
- Just... Just for a little...
- But I made you a cake, love.

1053
01:08:19,111 --> 01:08:21,654
- I'll have some later, Mum.
- But you just got here.

1054
01:08:21,739 --> 01:08:23,740
Rick, please don't go
to your room. Please, don't.

1055
01:08:23,824 --> 01:08:25,743
Don't mind what those people say.
Please, don't.

1056
01:08:25,827 --> 01:08:29,747
- But they're right. They're right.
- No, they're not right.

1057
01:08:29,789 --> 01:08:33,792
They could not be more wrong.
Rick, you are kind and you are good!

1058
01:08:33,918 --> 01:08:35,753
- They're right!
- You are so good.

1059
01:08:35,837 --> 01:08:38,797
- No, they're right, Mum!
- No, stop it! Come back, Rick!

1060
01:08:38,923 --> 01:08:40,632
Don't go to your room!
Don't go, Rick!

1061
01:08:45,430 --> 01:08:47,598
Oh, hello, sir.
Your change, please.

1062
01:08:47,682 --> 01:08:48,766
Oh, sorry.

1063
01:08:48,850 --> 01:08:51,018
- Miles away. Thanks very much.
- Thank you. Good night.

1064
01:08:51,102 --> 01:08:52,311
Good night.

1065
01:09:33,854 --> 01:09:35,647
Janet?

1066
01:09:36,899 --> 01:09:38,525
Janet?

1067
01:09:39,485 --> 01:09:41,486
Oh, Christ.

1068
01:09:41,654 --> 01:09:43,071
Jesus Christ.

1069
01:09:44,073 --> 01:09:46,074
I'm sorry, Dad.

1070
01:09:50,204 --> 01:09:52,205
Rick?

1071
01:09:54,083 --> 01:09:58,044
- What did you do?
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1072
01:09:58,170 --> 01:09:59,671
What did you do?

1073
01:10:07,263 --> 01:10:09,264
I need to call someone.

1074
01:10:12,185 --> 01:10:14,520
- It's gonna be all right.
- They'll say I'm bad.

1075
01:10:14,604 --> 01:10:17,356
- No, no, no.
- They'll say that I'm bad like before.

1076
01:10:17,441 --> 01:10:18,774
They have to come and look
after your mother.

1077
01:10:18,859 --> 01:10:20,192
You don't have to tell them.

1078
01:10:20,277 --> 01:10:21,360
It's all right, Rick.

1079
01:10:21,403 --> 01:10:23,446
You'll be all right.
Everything's fine.

1080
01:10:23,530 --> 01:10:25,197
You don't have to tell them.

1081
01:10:25,282 --> 01:10:26,866
You don't have to tell them, Dad!

1082
01:10:41,256 --> 01:10:42,715
Mr Oswald?

1083
01:11:55,540 --> 01:11:57,124
Hi, Rick.

1084
01:12:50,763 --> 01:12:53,056
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1085
01:13:04,068 --> 01:13:05,902
I'm gonna kill her.

1086
01:13:06,112 --> 01:13:08,447
- Maybe...
- Maybe what? Maybe what?

1087
01:13:14,037 --> 01:13:16,872
She knows she can't come and go
as she pleases.

1088
01:13:18,541 --> 01:13:19,541
Call her again.

1089
01:13:19,626 --> 01:13:21,627
She knows that from the last time.

1090
01:13:27,216 --> 01:13:28,925
Skunk. Yeah, it's Dad.

1091
01:13:29,052 --> 01:13:32,387
Yeah, listen, love,
I'm really, really, really worried,

1092
01:13:32,430 --> 01:13:34,640
so could you call me, please, darling?

1093
01:13:34,932 --> 01:13:36,808
All right. It's Dad.

1094
01:13:38,603 --> 01:13:40,562
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to look for her.

1095
01:13:40,605 --> 01:13:42,397
- Dad.
- What?

1096
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:44,692
I think I might know where she is.

1097
01:14:01,335 --> 01:14:02,418
Archie!

1098
01:14:02,503 --> 01:14:04,837
- I'm sorry to ring so late.
- Mike.

1099
01:14:07,007 --> 01:14:09,967
- And you come here to...
- Just hang out.

1100
01:14:10,969 --> 01:14:14,097
- Whose are the cigarettes?
- They're not mine.

1101
01:14:14,181 --> 01:14:16,474
- Can I just... Can I talk to you?
- This really isn't a good time.

1102
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:19,519
- It's not gonna take long.
Please? - Okay.

1103
01:14:20,187 --> 01:14:24,691
I just wanted to ring this once,
just to say, I don't know...

1104
01:14:25,359 --> 01:14:26,859
Just to say sorry.

1105
01:14:26,944 --> 01:14:30,488
- All right.
- You know, thank you for today

1106
01:14:30,614 --> 01:14:33,449
and for, you know,
for helping me out,

1107
01:14:33,534 --> 01:14:35,660
- and for Archie, too...
- Okay.

1108
01:14:35,787 --> 01:14:39,456
Listen, I was really rude to him
and I didn't mean to be.

1109
01:14:40,208 --> 01:14:42,459
He's really a decent guy.

1110
01:14:42,961 --> 01:14:44,962
And I wish you the very best.

1111
01:14:45,964 --> 01:14:47,339
All right.

1112
01:14:47,674 --> 01:14:52,302
And I... Will you do
one thing for me?

1113
01:14:52,721 --> 01:14:54,346
Kids, they wander in...

1114
01:14:54,472 --> 01:14:57,975
Will you just apologise
to Skunk for me?

1115
01:14:58,059 --> 01:15:01,311
We've spoken to her friends.
We've spoken to all of her friends.

1116
01:15:01,354 --> 01:15:04,857
For all the embarrassing shit

1117
01:15:04,983 --> 01:15:07,901
- that she's had to witness.
- No. So my daughter...

1118
01:15:07,986 --> 01:15:08,986
Okay, Mike.

1119
01:15:09,070 --> 01:15:11,905
...has Type 1 diabetes,
do you understand?

1120
01:15:12,407 --> 01:15:14,241
She has Type 1 diabetes!

1121
01:15:14,325 --> 01:15:17,494
'Cause she's a terrific kid.

1122
01:15:17,871 --> 01:15:19,079
So without...

1123
01:15:19,164 --> 01:15:20,831
- If she doesn't stay monitored...
- Okay, now just...

1124
01:15:20,874 --> 01:15:21,999
- No! She could die!
- Dad!

1125
01:15:22,041 --> 01:15:23,751
Do you understand me?!

1126
01:15:23,918 --> 01:15:26,712
You know, and someday
she's just gonna blow us all away.

1127
01:15:28,590 --> 01:15:29,883
Do you reckon... She's...

1128
01:15:30,009 --> 01:15:33,928
Kasia, someday she's just gonna
blow us all away.

1129
01:15:36,182 --> 01:15:38,016
Anyway,
that's all I have to say.

1130
01:15:41,020 --> 01:15:43,521
Yeah, you have a good life, yeah?

1131
01:15:44,398 --> 01:15:46,274
You too, Mike.

1132
01:17:03,436 --> 01:17:04,436
Hi, Rick.

1133
01:17:17,952 --> 01:17:19,870
Don't be scared. Don't be scared.

1134
01:17:21,163 --> 01:17:23,707
I just want your goodness.

1135
01:17:26,961 --> 01:17:29,546
I just want your goodness.

1136
01:17:34,802 --> 01:17:37,137
I just want your goodness.

1137
01:17:38,306 --> 01:17:40,473
I just want your goodness.

1138
01:18:35,906 --> 01:18:37,615
Shh...

1139
01:18:45,248 --> 01:18:47,708
Stop it, please. Stop it.
You have to stop it.

1140
01:18:48,877 --> 01:18:50,878
Please stop it. Stop it.

1141
01:18:54,049 --> 01:18:55,383
No! No...

1142
01:18:57,094 --> 01:18:59,095
No, no, no, no!

1143
01:19:00,556 --> 01:19:03,100
No, no, no! Please!

1144
01:19:33,089 --> 01:19:34,548
Did Dad come home?

1145
01:19:34,632 --> 01:19:36,049
No.

1146
01:19:37,385 --> 01:19:39,386
Where is he?

1147
01:19:41,014 --> 01:19:43,015
Don't know.

1148
01:20:11,003 --> 01:20:13,004
Jesus Christ.

1149
01:20:16,258 --> 01:20:17,800
Rick?

1150
01:20:42,451 --> 01:20:44,452
Yeah, hello, hello.
Can I get an ambulance, please?

1151
01:20:44,661 --> 01:20:45,953
Archie!

1152
01:20:47,248 --> 01:20:48,916
It's in, uh... Archie!

1153
01:20:51,544 --> 01:20:53,712
Uh, six... 13 Drummond Close.

1154
01:20:54,130 --> 01:20:55,714
I don't fucking know.
Just... Archie!

1155
01:20:56,591 --> 01:21:00,886
What? I don't fucking know!
Some people have been stabbed as well.

1156
01:21:00,970 --> 01:21:01,970
Please!

1157
01:21:02,138 --> 01:21:04,807
Yes! Thank you. All right.

1158
01:21:04,891 --> 01:21:07,976
Archie! Archie!

1159
01:21:11,106 --> 01:21:13,690
Come on, darling.
Your daddy's coming.

1160
01:21:14,359 --> 01:21:17,361
Your daddy's coming.
You're all right. You're all right.

1161
01:21:17,570 --> 01:21:19,238
Sweetheart, sweetheart, sweetheart.
Daddy's coming.

1162
01:22:33,356 --> 01:22:34,773
Rick.

1163
01:22:43,408 --> 01:22:45,284
Where's my dad?

1164
01:22:53,418 --> 01:22:56,629
And there were different
times in her life.

1165
01:22:56,838 --> 01:22:58,714
Different moments.

1166
01:22:58,798 --> 01:23:04,261
Some of them were sad,
but most of them were happy.

1167
01:23:05,597 --> 01:23:09,767
And the woman was you.
And she was stunning.

1168
01:23:18,860 --> 01:23:20,861
And, um...

1169
01:23:27,119 --> 01:23:28,370
Are you ready?

1170
01:23:29,872 --> 01:23:31,539
What's it like there?

1171
01:23:34,168 --> 01:23:37,420
Then your mum woke me up
and she said,

1172
01:23:38,714 --> 01:23:42,092
"Archie, she's here."

1173
01:23:46,806 --> 01:23:48,390
Christ.

1174
01:23:53,312 --> 01:23:55,021
You're my...

1175
01:23:56,941 --> 01:23:59,276
You're my girl.

1176
01:24:03,572 --> 01:24:06,032
Come back, Skunk.

1177
01:24:08,119 --> 01:24:09,661
Please.

1178
01:24:11,747 --> 01:24:13,248
Shall we go?

1179
01:24:13,916 --> 01:24:15,458
Okay.

1180
01:24:21,466 --> 01:24:23,009
Skunk.

1181
01:24:27,973 --> 01:24:29,974
I'll be back in a minute.

1182
01:24:46,074 --> 01:24:48,492
Why won't you say goodbye?

1183
01:24:54,875 --> 01:24:57,960
Please, Dad, just...
just say goodbye.

1184
01:25:03,717 --> 01:25:05,217
Skunk?

1185
01:25:05,302 --> 01:25:07,303
Please.

1186
01:27:09,679 --> 01:27:12,764
# Blue is where I want to be

1187
01:27:12,849 --> 01:27:15,934
# When I'm down I'm in the sea

1188
01:27:16,019 --> 01:27:21,023
# Looking up at monsters in the clouds

1189
01:27:22,358 --> 01:27:25,444
# Red's the colour when you're dead

1190
01:27:25,528 --> 01:27:28,697
# If you find me gone,
I'm just in bed

1191
01:27:28,781 --> 01:27:33,744
# Reading up on fairy tales instead

1192
01:27:34,913 --> 01:27:38,874
# Now I know so many things

1193
01:27:39,125 --> 01:27:42,836
# Got feet and I got wings

1194
01:27:42,921 --> 01:27:47,591
# To carry me back home

1195
01:27:47,842 --> 01:27:51,763
# To my house just made of bricks

1196
01:27:51,847 --> 01:27:55,600
# Well that's just such a fix

1197
01:27:55,684 --> 01:28:00,438
# To ever hold me down

1198
01:28:00,564 --> 01:28:03,691
# White is what I was to start

1199
01:28:03,776 --> 01:28:06,819
# Broken by my open heart

1200
01:28:06,946 --> 01:28:11,449
# Falling down and falling up again

1201
01:28:13,327 --> 01:28:16,454
# Black is white the other way

1202
01:28:16,539 --> 01:28:19,582
# Paradise is in the grey

1203
01:28:19,667 --> 01:28:24,546
# All my colours mixing up again

1204
01:28:25,798 --> 01:28:29,926
# Now I know so many things

1205
01:28:30,010 --> 01:28:33,846
# Got feet and I got wings

1206
01:28:33,931 --> 01:28:38,560
# To carry me back home

1207
01:28:38,727 --> 01:28:42,565
# To my house just made of bricks

1208
01:28:42,649 --> 01:28:46,610
# Well, that's just such a fix

1209
01:28:46,695 --> 01:28:51,198
# To ever hold me down

1210
01:30:33,345 --> 01:30:37,264
# Now I know so many things

1211
01:30:37,349 --> 01:30:41,018
# Got feet and I got wings

1212
01:30:41,103 --> 01:30:45,064
# To carry me back home

1213
01:30:45,982 --> 01:30:49,985
# To my house just made of bricks

1214
01:30:50,070 --> 01:30:54,699
