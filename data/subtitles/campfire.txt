Tammy, open the door.|Tell them Dad's not home.
They're here to buy the car,|they don't need to know I'm a widow.
Tell them your father's not home,|but your Mom is. It's okay, go on.
Esty can go.|- I won't be part of this.
Hi, we're here about the Peugeot.
My father's not home.|- When is he due back?
I don't know.
It's about the car? Good,|come on in, I'll get the keys.
My husband just stepped out.|- We don't want to disturb...
I'll bring the papers.|- We work nearby.
We'll come back when your husband's|at home. Have a nice day.
See you.
My father died of cancer a year|ago, two weeks before Lag B'Omer.
I was 15 at the time.
This week|the year of mourning ended
and Mom finally decided|to sell Dad's car.
It's been sitting in the same spot|since Dad last parked it there.
Since these are hard times for the|people of Israel, Mom also decided
to join the founding group of|a new settlement in the West Bank.
But first she has to pass Motke|Kupfer's acceptance committee.
This is Motke.
He likes to have his picture taken|with important people.
Mom always says that Motke
is one of the most influential|people in Religious Zionism.
But I think that my father|didn't like him much.
Shula, his wife,|is a good friend of my mother's
and Ya'ir, their youngest son,|is in my youth group.
Even the Minister of Interior|came to his Bar Mitzva.
Okay, tell us what you do.
I'm a construction engineer,|I work for a building company.
I'm an insurance agent.|- I'm a lawyer in a Tel-Aviv office.
I'm a special-ed teacher. - I'm an|English teacher for 5th graders.
Tell him what you do in the army.
In reserve duty,|I'm a battalion commander.
I think that these days we|should all take the initiative
and strengthen these settlements.
We feel that this|is the need of the hour.
And quality of life for the kids.|We couldn't afford that in the city.
It's really important to us,|to have a house with a lawn...
We couldn't afford that in the city.|- Yes, of course.
But that's not the main reason...
If you were on|the acceptance committee,
what kind of people would you pick|as your neighbors?
People like us, I think.
People like us.
Mainly people like us.
People like you.
You know, establishing a settlement|isn't just having meetings.
It's also hard physical work.|Are you sure you can handle it?
Alone?|- I'm not alone.
I won't lie to you. The number|of trailers we have is limited.
And if you move into one of them...
it means one less man|for guard duty,
one less for the prayer quorum.
It's something I need to consider.
I can't complete a quorum,|but I can do guard duty.
I see no problem here.
Okay, Rachel. Let us think about it|and get back to you.
Keep up the good work!
I'd just like to tell you
that being a part of this settlement|is very important to me.
You don't need another guard.
You need someone|who believes in the cause.
Someone strong enough|to withstand the difficulties,
and I have that strength more than|most of the people you know here.
This is my dream.
His name is Yossi Moraly.|The sweetest man, a bachelor.
If it's okay, I'll give him|your number. He'll call you.
Say yes, Rachel.|What's there to lose?
I've been planning this|for a year now.
It will also help them see|that you're serious.
I'm very serious. That's why|I said what I did earlier.
I just hope they understood me.
So you agree?|Can I give him your number?
All right.|What did you say his name was?
Yossi.|Yossi Moraly.
Why do you have to beg them?
If they want you, they'll say so.|And if they don't,
there's nothing for you there|anyway.
What do you mean, "if they don't|want us?" They don't.
Didn't you see how they treated us?
As though we were lepers|or something.
Anyway I'm not moving to that place.|There's nothing for me there.
So where do you intend to live?|I'm renting out the apartment.
If you rent it, I'll live on the|street and become a prostitute.
You'll have one daughter a settler|and another daughter a hooker.
What will you do?|Drag me there by force?
I don't want to live in that|settlement with your friends.
And I decided that at all costs,|no matter what,
this year I'll be happy.
Ignore them.|- Tammy Gerlick!
What's up?
Tammy Gerlick, what's up?|Got your period today?
Do you know them?|- They're in my youth group.
Tammy Gerlick!
Can I help you? - Yes.|You can behave like a human being.
What's that?
Go on, turn around!|Why d'you stop?
Watch your mouth. You don't|know who you're dealing with!
You're right, absolutely right.|We're sorry.
In my time we didn't have|people like that in Bnei Akiva.
He's cute...
Hello.
Just a moment, I'm not sure.|I'll see.
Dad, it's for you!|About the car!
Dad!
Mom, is Dad home?|It's about the car.
Dad!
Would you stop that already?|It's not funny anymore.
Hello.
Hello.|I'm Yossi.
Rachel.|Nice to meet you.
Are you hungry? 'Cause I haven't|eaten all day. - Very hungry.
Here.|Sit here.
Everything okay?
Everything okay?
I can turn on the heating.|- No thanks, I'm fine.
How do you know...|- I can...
Sorry. - No, no. Go ahead.|What were you saying?
No, I just wanted to ask|how you know Motke and Shula.
I heard you were good friends.
Motke and I were in yeshiva|together.
And I knew Shula even before that.
She's been trying to marry me off|for twenty years now.
Electricity flows from your hands|Love me gently
Love me with your hands,|Slowly, desperately
Cheek, neck, shoulder...
Love me with your hands,|slowly...
I'll have the sweet and sour|chicken, please. - Same for me.
She says you could order|something else
and she'll put it in the middle.|- No.
Chicken is fine.|Let her bring chicken. Excellent.
But she should bring us bread,|for the blessing.
I don't think they have bread|in a Chinese restaurant.
Eggroll, bring eggrolls.|Eggrolls are good.
She should bring eggrolls.|I've tried them, they're delicious.
Nice place, isn't it?|- Yes.
Did we disturb you?
No.
Well, what do you think?|- About what?
Think you'll want to see me again?
It's okay,|you can say no.
I know we're not right|for each other.
But I enjoyed tonight anyway.|I enjoyed meeting you. Really.
Thank you.
Am I your first date|since your husband died?
So how was it?|Okay?
I think so. I don't know.|You tell me.
I've been on much worse dates.|- Worse than this?
Believe me.
Once I was fixed up with a woman,|on a blind date, just like this,
and when I came to pick her up|it turned out
we'd already been fixed up|a few years before.
What, you didn't remember her name?|- No.
Neither did she.|How can you remember so many names?
Why, how many dates are we talking|about? How many women did you meet?
Hundreds.
But I stopped all that.
In the last two years|I stopped saying yes.
Why?
It wasn't working.
I felt bad.
I felt people had given up on me.
Truth is,|I pretty much gave up on myself.
And tonight? - You know Shula.|She's really pushy.
I thought she'd|already given up on me,
but then she came up with this idea|that I have to meet you...
So I felt awkward.|I agreed.
And that's it.
And you're terrific.
Okay, let's take you home.
MiniYossi Bus Service -
The best of luck to you, Rachel.
Just don't despair, everything|will be okay, I'm telling you.
And if you ever need a ride|anywhere, call me.
Okay, thanks.|- Good night. - Good night.
Esty, be careful not to walk|barefoot here now.
What?
What are you doing?
No one locks doors in my house.
You want privacy?|Get married.
Tammy, be careful|not to walk barefoot here.
Are you out of your mind?
You're a total psycho! What's wrong|with you? You should be committed.
I swear, I'll call the police!
Tammy. Bring me the garbage-can.|- Does this seem normal to you?
Why are you helping this madwoman?
Think I care?|I'll show you privacy!
Help! There's a crazy woman here!|Someone call the police!
Help!
If you don't come inside,|I'll smash your guitar.
If you touch my guitar, I'll take|off my clothes for everyone to see!
We'll see what they think of that|at the acceptance committee.
Hello.
My Dad's in army reserve duty.|Call back in a month.
We've decided to accept you|to the founding group.
But for a trial period.
I'm very sorry, Rachel,|but you have to understand.
A settlement is like a|delicate plant. A tiny plant.
Too much wind, too much rain,|and the plant dies.
So before I put it in the ground,|I have to make sure
it's strong, that all|the elements are at their best.
Let me get this straight.|Am I in, or not?
Before we move to the site,|we'll have a vote.
Are there any other people|on a trial period?
No.
Don't worry, I'm sure they'll accept|you in the end. Not to worry.
Did you talk to Yossi?
I understand|you're not interested.
Still, I wanted to thank you.|I'm glad I did it.
I'm glad too.
Remember, this is a second marriage.|Don't expect any fireworks.
You have to get it into your head|that you're looking for...
I don't know, a good friend|who'll keep you company.
He doesn't need to be a knight in shinin|armor. He just needs to be a "mensch."
Look,|I have someone else for you,
but I don't want to bother him|for nothing.
Maybe you're not ready yet.|- I'm ready.
His name is Moshe Weinstock,|he's divorced.
Motke knows him from the army,|he was an army cantor.
He's a very impressive,|very wealthy man.
He gets invited from all over|the world to lead the prayers.
Do you know him?|- No.
But I think Shmuel once|went to see him sing at a concert.
So are you interested?|- I think so. I...
Good, I'll talk to him.
But Rachel, I have to know|that you're serious.
He's not someone to play games|with. He's no MiniYossi.
Okay.|I get it.
It stings a little, but don't worry.
You have to keep it on|for ten minutes.
Careful you don't eat it...
You do that all your life?
You wish! Soon you'll start|growing a beard too.
But don't get upset. It's well-known|that hairy women are smarter.
I'd rather be stupid|but not have a beard.
At least you got Dad's coloring.
Imagine what it's like to have|a mustache like mine and Mom's.
Enough already.|Make up.
Know why Dad died quickly?
The doctors said some people|live for years with his illness.
He knew Mom didn't have|the patience to take care of him.
Tammy!
Tammy, come to eat.
I know you don't like to hear|Zionist talk.
But still,|here are just a few clean words.
We're setting out on a mission|thousands of kilometers from here
in order to save Israelis.
Just because they're Israelis.|And Jews.
And if we don't do it,|no one else will do it for us.
This is a long and complicated|operation
and I want to emphasize
that the success or failure|of the mission
depends on us alone.|Good luck.
Blessed be the True Judge.
Yoni is dead.
Goslan, you nut! Don't you dare|show your face here again!
Rachel?|- Yes. Moshe?
Moshe. Moshe Weinstock.|Hello. Nice to meet you.
I hope you didn't wait long?|- No.
Nice hotel, no?|I like it a lot.
Exclusive.|But not too fancy-shmancy.
They have a cake here.|A cheesecake. Unbelievable.
I'm not just saying that.|It's world-class.
You have to taste it.
Do you come here often?|- You might say they know me here.
Shula tells me you're a cantor.|- Cantor...
I just lead the prayers once in|a while. No need to exaggerate.
Kol Nidrei...
This is my favorite part.|It's my father's melody.
Come on, what are you afraid of?
I'm not getting into trouble|with your mother.
There's no one here.|- Are you out of your mind?
I'm not going into that room.|Think I'm crazy?
What's the matter? Come on.|- Come downstairs.
I don't want to go downstairs.|Who cares about the door?
Stop it, Esty.|I'm not kidding. I'm leaving.
Okay then, leave.
Don't be crazy.|We can't be here with that door.
Your mother's due back any minute.
Okay. No one's forcing you|to stay here. Go.
I swear, you're even crazier|than your mother.
Are you nuts? Blowing up|bullets here in the Center?
But what a cool explosion!|- He'll kick you out.
What's the matter, Tammy Gerlick?|Too snotty to say hi?
What, we don't exist?
If you'd say hi,|I'd answer you.
Okay, but why did you stop?|Keep going. Get lost!
Hey, you moron!|Forget about him, Tammy.
He's a psycho.|You can stay.
Why is she staring at us?|- Why are you chasing her away?
I feel like it.|- Great.
It's okay.|I have to go anyway.
Tammy Gerlick, is it true|that you put out? Tammy Gerlick.
Tammy Gerlick!
Stop it.|Shut up already.
Wait a minute, Tammy.
Hi.
I just wanted to tell you|not to be offended by what happened.
That Goslan guy is insane.
It's okay.|But thanks.
Who's the soldier|who was with you the other day?
Who, llan?|- He's just Yaniv's brother.
He doesn't have any friends his age,|so he hangs out with us.
I hope that's not yours.
Actually, it is.
It's okay, you can sit.
No one's touched it for a year.
I bet the battery's dead.
You know about cars?|- A little. Why?
Nothing.|The battery's dead.
Not just the battery...
Is this weird for you?
Why didn't you want us to visit you|while you were mourning?
Who said I didn't want you to?
That's what they said.
Ya'ir and Ayala would come to|the Center, huddle-up in a corner,
and then they'd choose the|delegation to comfort you.
Whoever wasn't chosen would stay|at the meeting with all the geeks.
So you stayed with the geeks?
The geeks and the lowlifes.
But then I went home.
That's how it is, when Ya'ir|and Ayala and you aren't there,
there is no point in staying.|Don't you know that?
That's funny.
I'm always sure that wherever I am|is where it's the least interesting.
Shame you didn't come to comfort us,|you'd see I was right.
They said your family didn't want|too many people coming.
Actually, I wanted you to come.
I have to go.
See you at the bonfire? - I may not|go to the youth group's bonfire.
Why not?
I think we'll have our own bonfire.|All the geeks and lowlives.
Shame.|My birthday's on Lag B'Omer.
What, right on the day?
According to the Gregorian calender|it's the day before.
A day before doesn't count.
'Bye.
Did you call for a ride?|- Thank you.
The world is like Noah's Ark.
If you're not in a couple,|you're left out.
What's so bad about that?
Maybe it's easier for men.
I want you to know, I look at you|and think how lucky you are.
You have two daughters,|a nice apartment, a community.
That's a lot.
And you're still young|and beautiful.
I probably won't have children.
I have some friends...
You've never had a serious|relationship with a woman?
All those women you met?
I'm attracted to women,|if that's what you're asking.
No, of course...|I just didn't understand.
But I've never had sexual relations|with a woman.
When I was at the Yeshiva, I said,|"I'll wait till I'm married."
And it didn't happen.
I'm sorry.|I didn't mean to embarrass you.
It's not something that usually|comes up. - It's okay. Really.
Are your parents alive?
Brothers? Sisters?
I have three sisters.|They're all grandmothers by now.
So you're in touch|with your nephews?
When they were kids,|I was the cool uncle.
The one who brought presents.
But in the last few years|everything changed.
They're busy with their own lives.
Everyone's busy.
What do you do on Shabbat?
Sleep.
Well, I think I'll be going.|It's late.
Good night, Yossi.|- Good night. Rachel.
If you ever need a ride anywhere,|call me. - Sure.
Good night.|- Good night.
Happy birthday, Tammy.|- Thanks.
You're welcome.|It's your birthday.
And I think this a great opportunity|for us to sit down and talk.
Since Dad died|I may not have done enough
to find out what you're going through,|but I'd like to change that.
I want to hear everything|you have to say, really I do.
Tell me everything that's|on your mind. Let it all out.
Tammy, do you want to start?
Esty can start.
In the last year|you've completely lost it.
That thing with the door,|what was that about?
The whole settlement thing,|Dad would never move there.
I'm sure he wouldn't have sucked up|to them like you do.
If that committee told you to run|around naked,
you'd do it and the last thing|you'd care about would be us.
That's what's on my mind.
Tammy?
I know you're having a hard time,|Mom,
but sometimes I feel...
you try so hard|to show the world we're okay,
that you overlook the fact that|we have feelings too.
We can't lead our lives according|to what Shula and Motke decree.
Of course, of course.
I'll take that into consideration.
I just want you to know
that you are the most precious|thing in the world to me
and that your lack of consideration|and cooperation...
I just feel that you do it|to spite me.
I feel that you blame me|for Dad's death.
You're young,|you don't understand...
and I hope you never will,
but I want you to understand this:
We're living under|a magnifying glass.
I want you to know that if we're not|accepted into this new settlement,
I'll be left here without|one single set of friends.
What you're doing is simply|spitting in my face.
If you want to be left|without a mother too,
then this is the way to achieve it.|- I don't need this.
Happy birthday. Tammy.
So you came?
No, but I brought you|a birthday present.
Thank you.
Do this with your hand.
Happy Birthday, Rafi -
Thank you.
Well, I'm off. They're waiting|for me at the bonfire. 'Bye.
'Bye.
Rejoice and be happy,|praise the holy word
Shimon Peres is a stinking turd...
Sanctify your life,|with the Torah
And purify it|through the labor.
Boys! The fruit of your labor|will make you happy!
Girls! The fruit of your labor|will make you happy!
Well? I hear from Moshe|that it was a big success.
That's what he told you?|- He hinted that it could lead somewhere,
but he wouldn't tell me too much.|You tell me.
It's a real experience,|to meet him, isn't it?
I'm very surprised|that's what he told you.
See?
Soon we won't know where you are,|you'll be globe-trotting with him!
How long do you think|he can mess with that piece of wood?
His entire life.
Want to go to Rafi's bonfire?
Now?
Why not?|We'll say hi to Rafi and come back.
I don't know.
No one here's giving us|the time of day anyway.
No. Forget it.|I don't feel like it.
Okay, I'm going.
Cute little girl|take off your shirt
And if you're sweaty|take off your bra
An angel from heaven|will come and kiss your breasts...
Let's go back.|Suddenly I don't feel like going.
Go back?|We're there already.
Let's at least say hi.
Okay, but if I want to go,|you're coming with me.
I'm not going back alone.
Tammy the whore|opened the store
Everyone's standing in line|with a huge hard-on
Inbal the whore|opened the store
Everyone's standing in line|with a huge hard-on
Here I pass|Standing near the stone
Rocks and ridges|A black asphalt road,
Evening falls slowly,|A sea breeze blows
The first star shines|Over beit-Machsir
Bab-el-Wad, forever|remember our names
Convoys broke through|on their way to the city...
Anyway, he pays her,
She comes over and undresses him,|he does her and comes,
she gets dressed,|so he says to her: Just a minute,
this was a regular fuck,|what was Spanish about it?
So she says:|You're right, I forgot.
Ole!
Hey, you morons,|you don't get jokes.
No, that was funny.|Great joke.
Here's another. The same rabbit|walks in the forest.
Wait, wait a minute.|Enough of your rabbit.
Maybe the girls have a joke.
Give them a chance.
Go on, relax a bit.|Got a joke? Tell us.
I'll laugh for sure.|Here, I'm already laughing.
Okay, I have a joke.
I don't believe it.|- Not very funny, but never mind.
A guy decides to give his wife|a jacuzzi for her birthday.
She's happy, gives him a kiss.
They both undress|and get into the jacuzzi,
splash around in the water.
Suddenly the doorbell rings.
So the wife gets out,|puts on her robe
and goes to see who it is.
When she opens the door it's|the upstairs neighbor, Mr. Cohen.
He looks at her with her robe|half open and says:
I didn't know you were so pretty.
I'll give you 100 dollars if you|open your robe more at the neck.
Just a little.|Half an inch.
So she opens her robe a little|at the neck,
Mr. Cohen looks and gives her|100 dollars.
Wow, this is|such a stupid joke...
Why? - Go on. You can't stop in|the middle of a joke. It's the rule.
Okay.
So Mr. Cohen looks at her legs
and says: If you open the robe|a little on the bottom,
I'll give you 100 dollars.
Open it just a tiny bit.|- Wait, what about the husband?
He didn't notice that his|wife is opening her robe? - Shut up!
Don't you know this joke?
Everyone came.
It was a success, wasn't it?
It's always a success.
Pity we didn't invite|Moshe Weinstock tonight.
Well, he's not|in the founding group.
But maybe Rachel will persuade him|to join us.
It was really successful tonight.|- It was, wasn't it?
Good night.|- I'm glad you came.
See you tomorrow at the march.|- Yes, sure.
Good night.|- Good night.
Yossi?|Did I wake you?
It's Rachel.
Hello.
I thought you might want to come|to the march with me tomorrow.
Cool. I didn't know girls had jokes|like that. - You'd be surprised.
You're crazy. Girls are twice as|horny as guys.
Am I right?
If I knew what it's like for guys,|I'd tell you.
I can't believe|you're even answering him.
Okay, I'm cold.|I want to go back.
I have a jacket in the car.|Want it?
You sure?|- You coming?
Stay a bit longer.|Don't go.
Till the fire goes out,|then we'll walk you back.
Okay?
If you like, you can sit|in the car and warm up.
Come to the side for a moment.|- What? Why leave?
Till the fire goes out,|then we'll go. I promise.
Okay, I'll be in the car.
Shirt hanging out,|shoelaces untied.
Didn't know where I came from.
Like I'm a reserve guy,|he says:
Soldier, over here!|So immediately I start to limp.
Sorry, do you mind|if I put my hand there?
I think the fire's going out.|No?
Wait, sweetie,|where're you going?
I think I'd better go.
Yaniv, go get the jerrycan.|Do me a favor.
Wait a minute, what's the rush?|- Leave me alone, I want to go.
Okay, we said, till the fire|goes out. It's not out yet.
Yaniv, pour some on we'll see if|it's gone out. - Let go of her, llan.
Pour it!
What? Just a kiss.|What's the big deal?
You okay?
Just say if you're okay or not.|I don't want you to start screaming.
You okay?
I want to leave.|- No problem.
Anyone stopping you?
What about the others?
They don't deserve|a goodnight kiss?
What about Goslan?|He doesn't deserve one?
And my brother doesn't deserve one?
Come on, Goslan,|let's see what you can do.
I'm holding her,|do what you want.
Let her go,|you'll get into trouble.
She agrees.|What are you uptight about?
You agree, don't you?
What did she come here for?
Here, see?|She agrees.
What do you think?|That's how women are.
First they say no,|but then they enjoy it.
Do you think|she doesn't want it?
Sure she does.|She just won't say she wants it.
It feels good, right?|See? It's not so bad.
Can't you see she's crying?
Come on, let her go, Goslan.|Let her go!
What are you yelling about?|Are you her father?
We're just playing around.|No big deal.
Here, I'm letting her go.
If she touches my dick,|I'll let her go.
I swear.
Just touch it for a second,|and I'll let you go.
What do you care?|No force, just a little touch.
That's all.
Convince her to say yes,|and I'll let her go.
What's the big deal?
Here,|I'll give you ten shekels too.
Come on, Tammy.
I'll let you go right after.|I swear.
Just a tiny touch,|and you get to keep the money.
Don't play hard to get.
And then|you swear you'll let her go?
I swear.|I swear by my mother.
Do you agree?
Tammy! Tammy!
Tammy! Tammy! Tammy!
What's the matter, Rafi?|Are you okay?
Look,|I'm sorry I hit you earlier.
I just wanted|to tell you something.
It's better to fuck some bimbo|than to be a snitch.
I hope you understand that.
You're Tammy, right?|- Yes.
I'm Yossi.
I know.
Your mother asked me to|drive her to the march.
So I'm waiting for her.
Shall I get her?|- No.
We're supposed to meet in|ten minutes. I'm just early.
I don't want her to be pressured.
Were you at the bonfire all night?|- Yeah.
What fun.|How I miss those days.
I hope you had a good time.|- What?
Ayala and Ya'ir got home|two hours ago.
Can you tell me where you've been|till now? - With Inbal.
What's that smell?|Did you sit inside the bonfire?
By the way, your ride is here.
How was yesterday?|- It was nice. Pity you didn't come.
I thought only the founding group|was invited.
Maybe we shouldn't go to the march?
Really?|- Yes.
So where do you want to go?|- I don't know.
Maybe somewhere with less people.
I know just the place.
Gerlick -
Hello there.|- Hi.
Is Tammy home?|- Yes. Want to come in?
I'll get her.
What's your name?|- Rafi.
Just a second, Rafi.
I don't know.|She won't answer me.
Maybe you want to come back this|afternoon? - No, it's okay. Thanks.
'Bye.
Do you miss your husband?
The girls miss him.
And you?
I miss having a man in the house.
But my marriage wasn't very good.|I married so young...
So why did you stay with him?
I don't know.
He was good to me.
What's with all the questions?|- Sorry.
No, it's okay.|You can ask.
I don't mind.
What do you want to know?
Did he know you didn't love him?
I think so.
More questions.
I have one more,|but I'm afraid of your response.
Ask away.|Worst case, I won't answer.
Is there any chance of you sleeping|with a man you're not married to?
You're very direct.|- Sorry. I shouldn't have asked that.
And if I asked you|the same question?
I've decided I would.
Where's Tammy?|- In her room.
Tammy, did you lock the door?
Shall I bring the hammer?
Tammy, open the door. - She's been|locked in since this morning.
Tammy, are you all right?
What do you mean, since this|morning? - I mean this morning.
Which part don't you get?
Tammy, why did you lock the door?|You know we don't lock doors here.
I'm sorry.
What's this? Don't you want|to change? Take a shower?
I'm tired.|Tomorrow, okay, Mom?
Someone named Moshe Weinstock|called. Twice.
Said to tell you he's coming to that|scouting trip of yours tomorrow.
So what did you tell him? - Don't|worry, I didn't spoil it for you.
And the sons, and the sons|returned to their homeland...
Where the hell are we?
Motke, couldn't you settle|somewhere closer to the city?
What, Ramallah isn't a city?
Why did you leave?
You can't hear a thing anyway,|with all that wind.
Get used to it. Do you know what|the wind is like here at night?
There are rumors going around about|what happened at Rafi's bonfire.
What are you talking about?|- Rumors.
I just wanted to say,|I don't blame you or anything.
And if you want to talk about it,|you can talk to me.
I just think that if we're going to|live together in this settlement,
we should talk.
What did you hear? What rumors?|- All kinds of things.
Tell me.|I want to know what you heard.
Don't you know?
No.
That you put out.
That I put out?
But I told you,|I don't blame you.
It's natural.
Ya'ir, what are you doing?
Are you crazy?|What are you doing?
I thought you wanted to.|- Idiot!
What happened?
Hi.
It's not right. Why didn't they|say there'd be cows here?
So beautiful.
Tammy, go in.|I'm coming.
Good night.
I'm sorry, I didn't plan|for Moshe Weinstock to be there
but I couldn't hurt his feelings.|- I know. It's okay.
Though Weinstock doesn't seem|the type to take offense easily.
You've noticed.
He invited me|to come to his concert.
Are you going?|- I don't know.
I told him I'd have to see|if I can make it.
It's really funny, you know...
Shmuel, my husband, wanted to be|a cantor. He loved cantorial music.
And he had a good voice.
But he was too shy|to sing in front of people.
I really hated it. He'd try to|drag me to all these concerts.
We'd fight,|and finally he'd go alone.
Go to that concert.
I hear he's pretty good.
I have to go.|- Okay.
If you need a ride anywhere...|- I'll call.
I know you're waiting|for someone better than me.
I can even understand it. I just|want you to know that I love you.
I think you're|a very special woman.
It's okay.|You don't have to answer me.
Good night.|- Good night.
I'm not waiting for someone better|than you. Don't ever say that.
You're the nicest person|I've ever met.
So what are you waiting for?
I don't know.
I'm waiting to fall in love.
I'm 42 years old,|and I've never been in love.
Shula says I shouldn't|wait for fireworks,
but that's exactly|what I'm waiting for.
You're so self-centered, you don't|even hear what you're saying.
Good night, Rachel.
What's that?|- Holy shit!
- Tammy Gerlick's a whore -|My mother will die.
Each candidate commits himself|in writing to be able
to pay the settlement's|monthly taxes. - No, wait, wait.
I just don't think it's my job to|check other people's bank accounts.
No, but they can sign a statement|that they're able to pay the taxes.
That's what the committee|is for, right?
But it means that from the onset|people without money can't join.
I want to get this straight. Is that|the message we want to send out?
It's not about a message. It's|about reasonable administration.
We're about to start a settlement|with very low living expenses.
A trailer or a mobile home|hardly costs anything.
If you want to control the quality|of your neighbors, you have to make sure
they're not here just because|it's the cheapest solution. See?
But our goal is not just to settle|the land, but to unite the people.
So let the National Committee add|a clause about uniting the people.
I'm not moving to the middle|of nowhere to live in a slum.
That's the whole idea. An|ideological settlement. Simple.
And you should be the first to know|what I'm talking about, Rachel.
Could you tell me|what that's supposed to mean?
Take a walk around the neighborhood.|It's all over the walls.
Remember, these are the worst years.|From now on things will get better.
How many years, exactly,|until the worst part is over?
Two years, three at the most.
Just take a deep breath and hold|your nose till high school's over.
Then go do your National Service|in the desert, or somewhere.
As far away from here as possible.
Not like me. If Dad hadn't died,|I'd go serve in Eilat,
or even in Egypt.
How I hated it|when he smoked.
I miss him so much.
I know.|Me too.
Whenever I think of him I remember|how Mom would drive him crazy.
Poor guy.
Want to tell me|what happened at the bonfire?
Esty.|Esty, wake up.
What do you want?|- I need your help.
When are you coming back today?
Are you talking to me?|- Yes, I want us to buy you sandals.
I don't have time today.|- So find time.
Would you talk to me for one minute?|- I'm late.
Never mind. Be late.|I want to talk to you.
I'm not angry with you. I just want|to know what happened at the bonfire
Tammy, if you don't tell me,|I won't be able to help you.
If someone hurt you,|I have to know about it.
Mom, I beg you, don't do anything.|- That's exactly what hurts me.
You didn't come to me when it|happened. Am I your enemy?
It's good to know what hurts you.
I don't need your help.|- Why are you taking that tone with me?
You don't need my help?|Are you trying to punish me again?
My life isn't hard enough?
I need to hear from Shula Kupfer|that my daughter's a whore?
Do you have any idea|where I spent the night?
I went around erasing graffiti|from the walls.
Thank you very much|for your help.
I want to know where all the|counsellors were when it happened!
How's it possible that I send|a 15 year-old, innocent child
to a Bnei Akiva bonfire
and she ends up spending the|night with a bunch of hoodlums?
I won't keep quiet about this.
I'm telling you, no one will get|away with this! I promise you!
Hello.
No, my Dad died a year ago.|If you want to buy our car,
you'll have to talk to my mother.|Good luck.
We know who they are|and it's being taken care of.
Believe me, it is.
This isn't the first time|we've had trouble with them.
So what are they doing|at Bnei Akiva?
Why didn't they...|- It's not that simple, Rachel.
They didn't come to the Center,|your daughter came to them.
We can't control everything|that goes on outside the Center.
But what am I supposed to do?|It could happen to another girl.
The fact is,|it didn't happen to another girl.
Motke, I'm going to the police.
And you'll be sorry|for the rest of your life.
You really want some cop to start|questioning all of Tammy's friends?
You don't know what really|happened there, either.
You don't let out things|like this.
Believe me,|it'll make the papers
and the whole world will talk|about the slut from Bnei Akiva
who seduced the boys in her group.|- She didn't seduce them!
She's not a slut, she didn't seduce them|- That's not what I said.
I said that's what they'll say|if it comes out.
So what am I supposed to do?
Nothing. It'll blow over, Rachel.
I promise you.
Look from Heaven|and perceive
That we have become an object|of scorn and derision
among the nations
Yossi, it's Rachel.
I need a ride.|Urgently.
I don't know...
Are you okay?|- No.
I'm sorry. I'm a horrible person.|- No. You're not.
I hurt everyone around me.|Shmuel, my girls, now you.
Something's wrong with me.|- Not true.
Remember what you said that night,|under my house?
I'm trying to forget.|- Don't forget.
I want you to love me.
But I already love you.
I'm going to wake them.
You know Yossi, don't you?
Esty, you haven't met Yossi.|Yossi, Esty. Esty, Yossi.
I have two very important things|I want to discuss.
First...
I want to know what you think|of the new settlement.
Before Motke calls his vote,|I want us to have our own vote.
Who's against moving|to the new settlement?
Okay.|Now, Tammy...
I want to talk to you alone,|in your room.
I just want to know that you're|all right, that nobody hurt you.
If you don't want to tell me,|you don't have to.
You can tell someone else,
the school counselor,|a psychologist.
You can write it down on a piece|of paper if you're embarrassed.
But it's not good to keep silent.
Silence is what I want now, Mom.
I'm okay.
I believe you.
I trust you.
I'm okay.
Don't worry.
Are you leaving?
I have to work this morning.
Don't you want to drink something?|- No, thanks.
I'm really late already.|Thanks.
Need a ride to school?
Hang on, I'll bring my bag.
Why did you run away this morning?|- You ran away too, didn't you?
What do you mean?
Do you usually go to school|at six-twenty in the morning?
So you don't have to work?
My mother will be offended.|- You think?
She likes to take offense.
So maybe it's better not to tell her|I didn't have to work this morning.
Why didn't you ever get married?
I guess something's wrong with me.|- I'm serious.
So am I.
God doesn't want certain people|to marry, so they won't reproduce.
So He spoils something|in their personality.
Something little,|that you don't notice at first.
But that something|makes them stay alone.
That doesn't make sense to me.
I know some couples... I can't|believe God wants them to reproduce.
So you think you'll never marry?
Chances are, no.
My mother will be sad to wake up|and find you gone. - You think?
I think so.
So we won't see you anymore?
Hello. Come in.|- Hello.
We'll sit in the living room.|A drink? - No, thank you.
Shall I bring you coffee and cake?|- No, thank you.
How's Tammy? Is everything alright?|- Tammy's fine.
I'm glad to hear it.
It's terrible what's happening|at the Center...
Some kids in Tammy's group|come from very problematic homes.
You wouldn't believe the stories|I hear from Ya'ir.
But things will probably be|much easier in the settlement.
You're in. We had a vote yesterday,|and I insisted you'd be in.
That's it.
What, did I surprise you?
Now the real thing begins.|There's lots of work.
Before we start|with the real thing,
I came to tell you that|I don't want to join the settlement.
I'm giving up my place.
What do you mean?|- I don't want to be there.
I don't understand.
I'm in shock! Do you realize how|hard Motke worked to get you in?
It was your dream.|Can you tell me what happened?
Well, I'm sure you'll find|a good family to replace us.
Well...
I'm shocked. Simply shocked.|- Stop being shocked about everything.
Don't talk to me like that!
Well, I think I'll be on my way.
I wish you the best of luck.
By the way, if you don't want|a reputation for being picky,
you should return|Moshe Weinstock's calls.
It's not very considerate|towards us either.
How picky can I be if I've been|your friend for all those years?
How ungrateful!
Hi. - Hi.
How did you know where I live?|- You're on the contact list.
Rafi, you coming? - Just a minute,|Goslan. I'll be right there.
I feel so shitty about|what happened at the bonfire.
Why did you come over there,|anyway?
For you.
So we'll be seeing you?
Do you want to see me?|- Yes.
And I decided that at all costs,|no matter what,
this year I'll be happy.
Start it!
