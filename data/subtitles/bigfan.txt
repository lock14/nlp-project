1
00:00:03,501 --> 00:00:05,234
<i>Joe in Piscataway, now you know</i>

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:07,133
<i>why your wife doesn't</i>
<i>talk to you anymore.</i>

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,968
<i>Let's go to Nick</i>
<i>in Valley Stream.</i>

4
00:00:09,033 --> 00:00:11,100
<i>He just got done</i>
<i>shopping at the mall.</i>

5
00:00:11,167 --> 00:00:12,501
<i>Hey, what's goin' on, Sports Dogg?</i>

6
00:00:12,567 --> 00:00:14,834
<i>Hey, man, those Giants</i>
<i>are lookin' good this week.</i>

7
00:00:14,901 --> 00:00:15,968
<i>They tore those Vikings up...</i>

8
00:00:21,701 --> 00:00:23,467
<i>You know what the</i>
<i>key to that game was? It was simple.</i>

9
00:00:23,534 --> 00:00:25,200
<i>They shut down</i>
<i>Adrian Peterson.</i>

10
00:00:25,267 --> 00:00:27,133
<i>Q.B. was all over the field</i>
<i>making tackles.</i>

11
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,267
<i>They couldn't get</i>
<i>their running game going.</i>

12
00:00:29,334 --> 00:00:31,901
<i>And the minute they didn't have the</i>
<i>running game, Frerotte was doomed.</i>

13
00:00:31,968 --> 00:00:36,234
<i>Nobody's passing against the G-Men</i>
<i>defense these days. They're on fire...</i>

14
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,467
I can't tell you how sick I am.

15
00:00:39,534 --> 00:00:41,167
<i>Manning's</i>
<i>not turning the ball over.</i>

16
00:00:41,234 --> 00:00:42,868
<i>He's doin' everything right.</i>
<i>He's managing the game.</i>

17
00:00:42,934 --> 00:00:46,501
<i>And defensively, if you can</i>
<i>get past that front four,</i>

18
00:00:46,567 --> 00:00:49,234
<i>then good luck</i>
<i>getting past Bishop...</i>

19
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:52,801
I can't tell you how sick I am.

20
00:00:54,734 --> 00:00:56,300
<i>Eli's on the money.</i>

21
00:00:56,367 --> 00:00:59,067
<i>Third and 20, he throws that screen pass,</i>

22
00:00:59,133 --> 00:01:02,234
<i>gave the first down</i>
<i>to Ward. Unbelievable.</i>

23
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,400
<i>They are not missing</i>
<i>a beat.</i>

24
00:01:04,467 --> 00:01:07,467
<i>Nobody's got an offense</i>
<i>like them. They just</i>

25
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:08,634
<i>keep on going.</i>

26
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:11,033
<i>That defense,</i>
<i>that defensive line,</i>

27
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,801
<i>and those linebackers</i>
<i>are doing great.</i>

28
00:01:13,868 --> 00:01:18,067
<i>Now going from greatness to</i>
<i>the total opposite... the Knicks.</i>

29
00:01:18,133 --> 00:01:20,601
<i>What's with this team?</i>
<i>We're gonna have to</i>

30
00:01:20,667 --> 00:01:23,133
<i>drag out another</i>
<i>two years of misery</i>

31
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,701
<i>till they</i> finally <i>decide they
wanna get LeBron James?</i>

32
00:01:28,767 --> 00:01:31,667
<i>This is ridiculous what</i>
<i>they're doing with this team.</i>

33
00:01:31,734 --> 00:01:34,067
<i>Who wants to go see a Knick</i>
<i>game? They're horrible.</i>

34
00:01:34,133 --> 00:01:36,133
<i>The team is a joke.</i>

35
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,234
<i>I mean, we live in New York.</i>
<i>This is the kind of basketball...</i>

36
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,968
It's $5.00.

37
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:42,567
I was just in there
for, like, five minutes.

38
00:01:42,634 --> 00:01:45,534
I know. It-- It's $5.00
anything up to two hours.

39
00:01:45,601 --> 00:01:48,167
<i>He's got a guy on the bench-- Marbury.</i>

40
00:01:48,234 --> 00:01:50,167
<i>They paid him</i>
<i>$22 million not to play.</i>

41
00:01:50,234 --> 00:01:51,634
Yeah, have fun in your box.

42
00:01:51,701 --> 00:01:53,334
<i> It's ridiculous.</i>

43
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,334
<i>This is a comedy.</i>
<i>I can't even watch them, they're so bad.</i>

44
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,901
<i> Steve in Bayside</i>
<i>venting his spleen!</i> Dick.

45
00:01:59,968 --> 00:02:01,601
<i>Let's go to line three,</i>
<i>Philadelphia Phil.</i>

46
00:02:01,667 --> 00:02:02,767
<i>What's happening</i>
<i>down there, brother?</i>

47
00:02:02,834 --> 00:02:05,334
<i>Are you freakin'</i>
<i>kidding me?</i>

48
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,133
<i>You can't stop the run, your</i>
<i>secondary's a bunch of rookies,</i>

49
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,534
<i>and you're 23rd in the league</i>
<i>in red-zone offense.</i>

50
00:02:10,601 --> 00:02:13,501
<i>You may be 9 and 2, but you're</i>
<i>a weak, vulnerable 9 and 2.</i>

51
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:15,634
<i>All right? Take away</i>
<i>that fluke win in Dallas</i>

52
00:02:15,701 --> 00:02:18,200
<i>and the Buffalo blizzard game,</i>
<i>and you're 7 and 4,</i>

53
00:02:18,267 --> 00:02:20,734
<i>exact same record as us,</i>
<i>my friend. All right?</i>

54
00:02:20,801 --> 00:02:23,968
<i>Man, I cannot wait till Sunday when finally,</i>

55
00:02:24,033 --> 00:02:25,834
<i>finally, your weakness</i>
<i>is gonna be exposed</i>

56
00:02:25,901 --> 00:02:27,167
<i>for all the world to see.</i>
<i>Right?</i>

57
00:02:27,234 --> 00:02:29,100
<i>It's Judgment Day</i>

60
00:02:33,501 --> 00:02:35,767
<i>Philadelphia Phil,</i>
<i>always a pleasure.</i>

61
00:02:45,167 --> 00:02:47,267

<i>Get your rabies shots.</i>

64
00:02:53,434 --> 00:02:56,467
<i>Here comes The Dogg</i>
<i>on</i> Sports Radio,

65
00:02:56,534 --> 00:03:00,067
<i>760, New York.</i>

66
00:03:00,133 --> 00:03:02,534
<i>I can't even</i>
<i>believe how this Pittsburgh team</i>

67
00:03:02,601 --> 00:03:05,400
<i>owns the Rangers.</i>
<i>In the playoffs last year,</i>

68
00:03:05,467 --> 00:03:07,934
<i>last night,</i>
<i>Crosby's doing his thing.</i>

69
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,467
<i>Mulligan, it's like he's skating around.</i>
<i>No one can stop him.</i>

70
00:03:10,534 --> 00:03:12,300
<i>They don't play defense,</i>
<i>the Rangers.</i>

71
00:03:12,367 --> 00:03:15,567
<i>Their penalty killing is dead.</i>
<i>They got no power play.</i>

72
00:03:15,634 --> 00:03:17,467
<i>And Lundquist only plays
well on the--</i>

73
00:03:17,534 --> 00:03:18,467
<i>Paul.</i>

74
00:03:18,534 --> 00:03:19,467
Yo, hey.

75
00:03:19,534 --> 00:03:20,467
<i>You're up third.</i>

76
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:21,601
Okay. Thanks, Lar.

77
00:03:21,667 --> 00:03:22,901
<i>Go, Giants. Go, Eli!</i>

78
00:03:22,968 --> 00:03:24,834
<i>Jeff in Clifton, NJ, baby!...</i>

79
00:03:24,901 --> 00:03:27,267
<i>Let's go to my boy Paul</i>
<i>in Staten Island.</i>

80
00:03:27,334 --> 00:03:29,601
<i>He always brings the leverage.</i>
<i>What's on your mind, brother?</i>

81
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:31,367
Hey, Sports Dogg!
How ya doin'?

82
00:03:31,434 --> 00:03:35,501
I'm just calling to say
I can't wait for this Sunday

83
00:03:35,567 --> 00:03:39,667
when we finally shut these Philly
clowns up once and for all.

84
00:03:39,734 --> 00:03:43,167
I can't tell you how sick I am

85
00:03:43,234 --> 00:03:47,400
of Philadelphia Phil and
all these cheesesteak bozos

86
00:03:47,467 --> 00:03:50,367
goin' on
about Brian Westbrook this

87
00:03:50,434 --> 00:03:53,901
and how we can't stop
their passing game?

88
00:03:53,968 --> 00:03:56,267
Are-- Are you joking?

89
00:03:56,334 --> 00:03:59,300
You put-- You put the tiniest
bit of pressure on McNabb,

90
00:03:59,367 --> 00:04:01,133
that guy crumbles
like a cookie.

91
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,133
<i>Now, you guys may have put some</i>
<i>points up against the Skins last week,</i>

92
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,367
<i>and that's fine, but the G-Men are</i>
<i>a whole different story, my friend.</i>

93
00:04:09,434 --> 00:04:10,367
<i>You think you're gonna</i>

94
00:04:10,434 --> 00:04:12,968
throw for 388 yards

95
00:04:13,033 --> 00:04:16,534
with Quantrell Bishop
in your face all day long?

96
00:04:16,601 --> 00:04:19,033
It's not easy hitting a receive-- Paul.

97
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,834
It's not easy hitting the
receiver laid out on your back.

98
00:04:21,901 --> 00:04:24,334
So listen up, Philadelphia Phil, and all the rest

99
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,400
of you brotherly love jobronis who've
been-- It's the middle of the night!

100
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:31,100
...who've been talking smack
all week on this show,

101
00:04:31,167 --> 00:04:35,000
get out your forks because you're
gonna be eating your words big-time!

102
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:36,767
<i>I love his passion. Thanks, Paul.</i>

103
00:04:36,834 --> 00:04:38,400
Thanks, Sports Dogg.
You the man.

104
00:04:40,267 --> 00:04:42,000
Do you mind?

105
00:04:42,067 --> 00:04:44,300
Yes, I do.
I'm trying to sleep.

106
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:46,067
Hey, I'm--
I'm off. Okay?

107
00:04:46,133 --> 00:04:48,033
You try sleeping
with that racket.

108
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,567
I'm off.

109
00:04:49,634 --> 00:04:51,067
All night
with the calls.

110
00:04:51,133 --> 00:04:52,267
Go to bed, Mom.

111
00:04:53,801 --> 00:04:56,133
What kind of thing is that for a grown man?

112
00:04:57,801 --> 00:04:59,200
I'm quiet.

113
00:04:59,267 --> 00:05:01,234
That's quiet by you?

114
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,968
Yakking away like some kind of-- I'm quiet!

115
00:05:04,033 --> 00:05:06,934
I'm quiet, I'm quiet, I'm quiet!

116
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,400
Dude, you were on fire.

117
00:05:08,467 --> 00:05:09,400
<i>I f--</i>

118
00:05:10,834 --> 00:05:12,834
feel like it needed
to be said.

119
00:05:12,901 --> 00:05:15,501
<i>The part about how they should</i>
<i>get out their forks 'cause they're</i>

120
00:05:15,567 --> 00:05:18,567
gonna be eating their words?
That's fuckin' beautiful.

121
00:05:18,634 --> 00:05:20,767
Yeah. I guess
I just have a gift.

122
00:05:20,834 --> 00:05:23,200
I wish I could do that.

123
00:05:23,267 --> 00:05:24,501
Do it.

124
00:05:24,567 --> 00:05:25,801
I'd be too nervous.

125
00:05:25,868 --> 00:05:27,901
<i>It's easy.</i>

126
00:05:27,968 --> 00:05:28,901
<i>For you.</i>

127
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,834
What time you wanna
go tomorrow?

128
00:05:31,901 --> 00:05:35,400
I'll pick you up
around 10?

129
00:05:35,467 --> 00:05:36,501
Cool.

130
00:05:36,567 --> 00:05:38,400
All right.
Get some sleep. Big day.

131
00:05:42,334 --> 00:05:43,267
Uhh.

132
00:06:49,767 --> 00:06:50,834
Whoo!

133
00:06:52,133 --> 00:06:53,234
Whoo!

134
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,234
Here we go!
Here we go!

135
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,067
Here we go! Oh, yeah!

136
00:07:00,634 --> 00:07:01,567
Yeah!

137
00:07:02,701 --> 00:07:03,634
Yeah.

138
00:07:17,467 --> 00:07:18,400
Whoo-ee!

139
00:07:29,033 --> 00:07:30,734
Whoo! Yeah!

140
00:07:35,601 --> 00:07:37,300
Oh, forced to scramble!

141
00:07:45,467 --> 00:07:47,167
Here we go. Giants!

142
00:07:49,133 --> 00:07:50,467
Here we go! Giants!

143
00:07:51,801 --> 00:07:53,734
Giants.
Bishop with the sack!

144
00:07:53,801 --> 00:07:56,000
Bishop with the sack!
What a play by Strahan!

145
00:07:56,067 --> 00:07:58,901
Hey. Oh. Let's--
We should get our seats.

146
00:07:58,968 --> 00:08:00,934
Game day. Game day!

147
00:08:06,634 --> 00:08:08,234
<i>The Giants</i>
<i>have won the coin toss</i>

148
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,234
<i>and have elected</i>
<i>to receive the kick.</i>

149
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,234
<i>Back for the kick</i>
<i>is Ahmad Bradshaw.</i>

150
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,734
Here we go. Here we go. Let's do it.

151
00:08:14,801 --> 00:08:16,200
Here we go.
Let's do it.

152
00:08:16,267 --> 00:08:19,000
Here we go.
Let's tee it up.

153
00:08:19,067 --> 00:08:20,834
We're marching! <i>And that's the
third pass to Toomer on this point.</i>

154
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:22,467
We're marching up the field.

155
00:08:22,534 --> 00:08:24,234
We're marching up the field!

156
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,701
We're marching up the field! Whoo!

157
00:08:26,767 --> 00:08:27,734
Whoo!

158
00:08:27,801 --> 00:08:29,601
Yeah!
<i>Giants, first down.</i>

159
00:08:29,667 --> 00:08:31,534
<i>And the Eagles...</i>

160
00:08:31,601 --> 00:08:33,367
Come on, ref!

161
00:08:33,434 --> 00:08:34,868
You--
Yeah!

162
00:08:34,934 --> 00:08:36,667
Run the football!
Come on!

163
00:08:36,734 --> 00:08:38,167
They got no answer
for us!

164
00:08:38,234 --> 00:08:40,400
That's right. Yeah, go to your fuckin' huddle!

165
00:08:41,601 --> 00:08:42,534
Ohh!

166
00:08:42,601 --> 00:08:44,434
How the fuck is
that not called?

167
00:08:44,501 --> 00:08:46,734
<i>That is a ball you just can't drop.</i>

168
00:08:46,801 --> 00:08:48,801
<i>It is right--</i>

169
00:08:48,868 --> 00:08:51,067
<i>Oh, there's a flag</i>
<i>on the play.</i>

170
00:08:51,133 --> 00:08:54,033
<i>45 finally brought down</i>
<i>by Quantrell Bishop.</i>

171
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,934
Yeah! Oh! <i>Second sack of the day for Bishop.</i>

172
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,567
You show me nothing! You suck!

173
00:08:57,634 --> 00:08:59,667
You suck!
Throw the fuckin' flag!

174
00:09:01,968 --> 00:09:04,100
<i>And that's a flag</i>
<i>on the play.</i>

175
00:09:07,934 --> 00:09:11,133
<i>15! 10! 5! Touchdown!</i>

176
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,367
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

177
00:09:12,434 --> 00:09:15,467
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

178
00:09:15,534 --> 00:09:19,167
<i>Oh, man, am I feeling good tonight.</i>

179
00:09:19,234 --> 00:09:22,033
<i>I know you're not</i>
<i>talking about the Knicks, Romeo.</i>

180
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:25,334
<i>Ha ha. Yeah, boy.
I'm talking about the Giants, baby.</i>

181
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,234
<i>We rocked that field--</i>
Hello?

182
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,501
Can I pay?

183
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:31,033
Sorry. Sorry.

184
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,200
<i>He's running for his life.</i>

185
00:09:32,267 --> 00:09:34,100
<i>This game was over</i>
<i>in the second quarter.</i>

186
00:09:34,167 --> 00:09:36,200
<i>They should have just</i>
<i>stayed in the locker room</i>

187
00:09:36,267 --> 00:09:37,901
<i>and gotten on the bus</i>
<i>and gone to the airport.</i>

188
00:09:37,968 --> 00:09:39,734
<i>They had no
chance in the second half</i>

189
00:09:39,801 --> 00:09:41,467
<i>against Bishop and that defense.</i> Hello.

190
00:09:41,534 --> 00:09:42,534
You calling?

191
00:09:42,601 --> 00:09:44,234
In a minute.

192
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,667
<i>You know what</i>
<i>you're gonna say?</i>

193
00:09:45,734 --> 00:09:49,000
Oh, I'll probably just,
uh, wing it as usual.

194
00:09:49,067 --> 00:09:52,300
Dude, I can't wait to hear you
put that douche bag in his place.

195
00:09:52,367 --> 00:09:55,868
Oh, I will.
With a vengeance.

196
00:09:55,934 --> 00:09:58,634
<i>The Giants' defense</i>
<i>right now is sickening.</i>

197
00:09:58,701 --> 00:10:00,534
<i>Look at what Quantrell Bishop's doin' lately.</i>

198
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:03,767
<i>He's a monster.</i>
<i>He's harassing every team he's facing.</i>

199
00:10:03,834 --> 00:10:06,100
<i>They don't know what to do with him.</i>
<i>They can't even deal with him.</i>

200
00:10:06,167 --> 00:10:08,133
<i>Total domination</i>
<i>by the Giants.</i>

201
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,801
<i>I know my</i>
<i>boy Paul in Staten Island</i>

202
00:10:09,868 --> 00:10:11,467
<i>was loving life watching</i>
<i>that game yesterday.</i>

203
00:10:11,534 --> 00:10:12,467
<i>What do you got, bro?</i>

204
00:10:12,534 --> 00:10:14,434
Hey, Sports Dogg.
How ya doing?

205
00:10:14,501 --> 00:10:17,467
Um, I just got one thing to say to Eagle Nation,

206
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:19,767
especially a certain
Philadelphia Phil,

207
00:10:19,834 --> 00:10:23,801
and that is... ha!
Ha ha ha!

208
00:10:23,868 --> 00:10:27,467
Just like I promised,
we manhandled you on Sunday.

209
00:10:27,534 --> 00:10:30,434
For 60 solid minutes,
we dominated the line of scrimmage

210
00:10:30,501 --> 00:10:32,367
on both sides of the ball.

211
00:10:32,434 --> 00:10:36,701
Quantrell Bishop
was in your face all day long.

212
00:10:36,767 --> 00:10:39,667
What happened
to shutting him down?

213
00:10:39,734 --> 00:10:42,567
Two sacks, seven tackles,
two forced fumbles,

214
00:10:42,634 --> 00:10:44,200
and a fumble recovery?

215
00:10:44,267 --> 00:10:47,200
If that's shutting him down,
I'd hate to see not shutting him down!

216
00:10:47,267 --> 00:10:49,400
Ha! <i>Quantrell was in your backfield</i>

217
00:10:49,467 --> 00:10:51,767
so much, I almost
mistaked him for an Eagle!

218
00:10:53,334 --> 00:10:54,467
<i>I love that dude in Staten Island,</i>

219
00:10:54,534 --> 00:10:55,467
<i>bringing it hard</i>
<i>every night.</i>

220
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,467
Do we have to stay
for the whole thing?

221
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:01,767
Paul, stop it.

222
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:08,534
Welcome! Come on in.
Come in, come in, come in. Hi!

223
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:10,601
Hi!
Hey, Ma.

224
00:11:10,667 --> 00:11:12,534
Thank you. Thank you. All right.

225
00:11:12,601 --> 00:11:13,801
Oh, he's gonna love it. Mmm...

226
00:11:13,868 --> 00:11:15,200
Thank you.
Ohh...

227
00:11:17,167 --> 00:11:18,200
What's up, what's up?

228
00:11:18,267 --> 00:11:21,400
Let's get this party
started!

229
00:11:21,467 --> 00:11:23,467
The cake,
he's gonna love it.

230
00:11:23,534 --> 00:11:25,434
Are you kidding me?
He's gonna fuckin' freak.

231
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,634
I'm so proud of him.

232
00:11:35,868 --> 00:11:36,934
Okay, let's go.

233
00:12:00,734 --> 00:12:01,801
Yay!

234
00:12:01,868 --> 00:12:02,801
That's nice.

235
00:12:02,868 --> 00:12:04,200
Baby, that's your gift.

236
00:12:04,267 --> 00:12:05,801
Very good.

237
00:12:05,868 --> 00:12:06,801
Nice.

238
00:12:06,868 --> 00:12:08,000
Look at that.

239
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,067
Right now,
we're America's fastest-growing warehouse club.

240
00:12:15,133 --> 00:12:18,968
By 2012, there's gonna be 350
locations all across the country.

241
00:12:19,033 --> 00:12:20,267
Wow.
Costco

242
00:12:20,334 --> 00:12:22,100
right now is crapping
in their pants.

243
00:12:25,834 --> 00:12:28,067
So, Paul, you know the offer still stands.

244
00:12:28,133 --> 00:12:29,267
I have a job.

245
00:12:29,334 --> 00:12:30,367
Yeah, I know,
but I think

246
00:12:30,434 --> 00:12:31,901
you could really go far
in about five years--

247
00:12:31,968 --> 00:12:33,734
I have a job.

248
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,567
Don't you want
something better?

249
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:42,367
You know, what
if I offer youa job?

250
00:12:42,434 --> 00:12:44,367
I mean, maybe
I feel bad for you,

251
00:12:44,434 --> 00:12:46,968
stuck inside of a depressing
dentist's office.

252
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,701
How is a dentist's office
depressing?

253
00:12:51,167 --> 00:12:52,734
Gather round, folks!

254
00:12:58,434 --> 00:12:59,534
Showtime.

255
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,601
So exciting.

256
00:13:06,868 --> 00:13:08,767
I got goose bumps.

257
00:13:13,968 --> 00:13:15,000
Is it working?

258
00:13:26,801 --> 00:13:28,934
<i>I'm Jeff Aufiero,</i>

Nice!

My son,
the TV star!

271
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,434
Great, bro!

272
00:14:12,501 --> 00:14:13,868
Thank you.
That's fantastic.

273
00:14:13,934 --> 00:14:14,901
Yeah.

274
00:14:14,968 --> 00:14:16,968
He's another
Martin Scorsese!

275
00:14:17,033 --> 00:14:18,167
Very, very professional.

276
00:14:18,234 --> 00:14:20,100
How much did that cost ya? Couple of nickels.

277
00:14:20,167 --> 00:14:22,667
I like when you point
because you really meant it.

278
00:14:24,167 --> 00:14:26,467
Awesome. That was amazing, bro. Amazing.

279
00:14:26,534 --> 00:14:27,801
Thank you.
Thank you.

280
00:14:27,868 --> 00:14:29,000
Could we see it
again?

281
00:14:36,534 --> 00:14:39,467
What do you have
against Price Club?

282
00:14:39,534 --> 00:14:41,400
I'd rather not
discuss my career.

283
00:14:41,467 --> 00:14:43,434
You have a career?

284
00:14:43,501 --> 00:14:46,100
That's news to me.

285
00:14:48,734 --> 00:14:51,167
You could actually go
somewhere at Price Club.

286
00:14:51,234 --> 00:14:53,367
Yeah, like Dennis? Please.

287
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:56,901
He's doing extremely well
for himself.

288
00:14:56,968 --> 00:14:58,534
Okay.

289
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:03,767
Who knows?
You could probably meet somebody.

290
00:15:03,834 --> 00:15:04,934
Well, what
does that mean?

291
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,634
Your brother and sister
both found people at work.

292
00:15:07,701 --> 00:15:10,400
Yeah, Gina
was Jeff's secretary.

293
00:15:10,467 --> 00:15:11,801
He cheated on his wife
with her.

294
00:15:11,868 --> 00:15:14,167
She's a lot better for him
than that louse Roberta.

295
00:15:14,234 --> 00:15:16,567
He's a cheat. He fucked her
while he was still married.

296
00:15:16,634 --> 00:15:18,601
Don't say that word
in my car.

297
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:20,801
Which one? "Fucked" or "cheat"? You know.

298
00:15:20,868 --> 00:15:22,367
It's what he did.
He fucked her.

299
00:15:22,434 --> 00:15:24,767
For years while he was married. Stop it.

300
00:15:24,834 --> 00:15:26,167
I don't want
that language in my car.

301
00:15:26,234 --> 00:15:28,334
Oh, so it's worse for me to
say it than for him to do it?

302
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,467
Cut it out, Paul.

303
00:15:29,534 --> 00:15:31,701
No, I wanna know.
Is it worse for me

304
00:15:31,767 --> 00:15:35,234
to say the sentence, "Jeff fucked his secretary,"

305
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,467
than it is for Jeff
to fuck his secretary?

306
00:15:37,534 --> 00:15:39,634
You should only meet
somebody as good as Gina.

307
00:15:39,701 --> 00:15:41,467
Oh, boy, that'd
be tough to top.

308
00:15:41,534 --> 00:15:42,467
Yeah, for you.

309
00:15:42,534 --> 00:15:44,701
Yeah, give me
about an hour.

310
00:15:44,767 --> 00:15:47,467
You have to actually
date someone to top it.

311
00:15:47,534 --> 00:15:48,501
I date.

312
00:15:48,567 --> 00:15:50,501
Oh, sure. You're dating
lots of girls.

313
00:15:50,567 --> 00:15:51,934
You don't think I date?

314
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,434
I know exactly who you're
dating. Your hand.

315
00:15:54,501 --> 00:15:55,868
What did you just say?

316
00:15:55,934 --> 00:15:58,434
You think I don't see those
tissue balls in your garbage pail?

317
00:15:58,501 --> 00:16:00,133
What the hell!
Either that,

318
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,200
or you're just sneezing a lot.
Maybe you just had a very bad cold

319
00:16:03,267 --> 00:16:05,434
for the last 15 years.
I'm not hearing this.

320
00:16:05,501 --> 00:16:06,567
The kind of cold
where you sneeze

321
00:16:06,634 --> 00:16:08,234
out of your you-know-where! Oh, Jesus!

322
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,100
I'm not hearing this!
You probably don't think I don't see

323
00:16:10,167 --> 00:16:12,901
those doo-doo stains in your
underpants, neither. Oh, God.

324
00:16:12,968 --> 00:16:14,834
Leave it alone.
You don't like it?

325
00:16:14,901 --> 00:16:17,701
Do your own laundry. And keep
your hands off your privates!

326
00:16:17,767 --> 00:16:18,934
La la la la la la la!

327
00:16:25,467 --> 00:16:26,968
Man, how can you
eat that shit?

328
00:16:29,167 --> 00:16:30,801
It's the best.

329
00:16:30,868 --> 00:16:32,000
You ever try?

330
00:16:32,067 --> 00:16:34,667
Yeah. I think when it comes to pizza toppings,

331
00:16:34,734 --> 00:16:37,000
I'll trust the Italians
over the Hawaiians.

332
00:16:37,067 --> 00:16:38,000
Try it.

333
00:16:38,067 --> 00:16:39,000
No, thanks.

334
00:16:39,067 --> 00:16:40,567
You know,
you might like it.

335
00:16:40,634 --> 00:16:44,133
I don't need to drink piss
to know it tastes like piss.

336
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,367
Mmm.

337
00:16:52,434 --> 00:16:53,434
Mmm.

338
00:16:53,501 --> 00:16:54,467
You gonna give

339
00:16:54,534 --> 00:16:57,000
Philadelphia Phil
some more shit tonight?

340
00:16:57,067 --> 00:17:00,567
Know what I was thinking?
I let himmake the next move.

341
00:17:01,634 --> 00:17:02,634
That's a good strategy.

342
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:16,834
Holy shit.

343
00:17:19,567 --> 00:17:20,501
What?

344
00:17:24,801 --> 00:17:26,501
Oh, shit!

345
00:17:30,033 --> 00:17:31,501
No way.

346
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,033
Fuck's he doing
in Staten Island?

347
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,100
I don't know!

348
00:17:39,167 --> 00:17:40,801
Where's he going?
I don't know!

349
00:17:43,267 --> 00:17:45,734
Quantrell fuckin' Bishop!

350
00:17:57,567 --> 00:17:59,767
Fuckin' Stapleton.

351
00:18:04,801 --> 00:18:06,834
Oh, maybe he's here
to see the Wu-Tang.

352
00:18:24,267 --> 00:18:25,901
Who is that guy?

353
00:18:29,434 --> 00:18:31,801
I don't know. Maybe he played with him at UT.

354
00:18:34,434 --> 00:18:37,167
Maybe that's his house.
Maybe he lives in Stapleton.

355
00:18:45,467 --> 00:18:47,801
I really
gotta go to the bathroom.

356
00:19:00,968 --> 00:19:01,934
Sst. Look.

357
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,334
You think he's going
to a party or something?

358
00:19:18,501 --> 00:19:19,667
Mmm...

359
00:19:19,734 --> 00:19:21,601
It's a little late
to be first heading out.

360
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,200
Uh, hey, so do we, like-- So long, guys.

361
00:20:33,267 --> 00:20:34,701
Can't park here.

362
00:20:34,767 --> 00:20:35,834
Okay. Okay.

363
00:20:46,167 --> 00:20:48,534
There's no fuckin'
parking in Manhattan.

364
00:20:54,434 --> 00:20:57,033
Let's just put it in a garage. Fuck it.

365
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,033
Where?

366
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,934
Slow, slow. Slow. Slow.

367
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,701
On the right.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

368
00:21:01,767 --> 00:21:03,167
Yeah.

369
00:21:05,968 --> 00:21:07,734
Shut the fuck up! We're turning! Go around!

370
00:21:09,567 --> 00:21:11,334
Jesus Christ!

371
00:21:17,267 --> 00:21:21,200
"18 for the first..." Is that what that says?

372
00:21:22,934 --> 00:21:24,300
That's worse
than the hospital.

373
00:21:26,467 --> 00:21:27,567
Right this way.

374
00:21:31,834 --> 00:21:33,067
20.

375
00:21:36,801 --> 00:21:37,767
Each.

376
00:21:45,801 --> 00:21:48,434
Gentlemen, step up
for your drink, please.

377
00:21:55,968 --> 00:21:58,167
Yeah, uh, I'll get,
uh, a Bud Light.

378
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:00,834
Bud's fine?

379
00:22:00,901 --> 00:22:02,000
Bud's good, yeah.

380
00:22:02,067 --> 00:22:03,000
Uh, same.

381
00:22:03,067 --> 00:22:04,133
Two Buds.

382
00:22:10,467 --> 00:22:12,267
That'll be $9 each.

383
00:22:12,334 --> 00:22:13,934
Each? For a Bud?

384
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,234
Fuckin' Manhattan.

385
00:22:29,834 --> 00:22:32,167
Right fucking there.

386
00:22:34,801 --> 00:22:36,033
Hi, guys.
How are you?

387
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,000
Hey...

388
00:22:38,067 --> 00:22:39,534
My name is Christiana.

389
00:22:39,601 --> 00:22:41,300
Hi.
What's your name, baby?

390
00:22:41,367 --> 00:22:42,534
Uh, my name is Paul.

391
00:22:42,601 --> 00:22:43,968
Hi, Paul. Nice to meet you. Hi.

392
00:22:44,033 --> 00:22:45,067
You look so cute.
Hi.

393
00:22:45,133 --> 00:22:46,534
Oh, thank you.

394
00:22:46,601 --> 00:22:48,133
Where you from?

395
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,868
Uh, um,
I'm from Staten Island.

396
00:22:49,934 --> 00:22:50,901
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.

397
00:22:50,968 --> 00:22:52,200
It's your first time
you're here?

398
00:22:52,267 --> 00:22:53,834
It is. It is.

399
00:22:53,901 --> 00:22:55,400
Yeah? Do you
like this place?

400
00:22:55,467 --> 00:22:56,634
I do. It's great.

401
00:22:56,701 --> 00:22:58,634
Yeah? Do you
want a dance?

402
00:22:58,701 --> 00:23:02,601
Uh, that's-- that's very, uh, nice,
but I'm-- I'm gonna pass.

403
00:23:02,667 --> 00:23:04,234
Thank you.
Very nice. Thank you.

404
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,000
What about you, baby?
My name is Christiana.

405
00:23:10,067 --> 00:23:12,501
Oh. Would you like some dance?

406
00:23:12,567 --> 00:23:13,601
Uh, what's that?

407
00:23:14,901 --> 00:23:16,367
Do you want a dance?
Oh, dance.

408
00:23:16,434 --> 00:23:17,667
Can I dance for you?

409
00:23:18,734 --> 00:23:21,434
Um, yes, you may.
Um, later on.

410
00:23:21,501 --> 00:23:24,234
But right now I have to,
uh, I'm on a job.

411
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,968
Okay, I'll come back
later. No problem.

412
00:23:35,133 --> 00:23:36,567
God, I wish
I'd brought a Sharpie!

413
00:23:36,634 --> 00:23:37,834
What's he gonna sign?

414
00:23:37,901 --> 00:23:39,400
My balls. Who cares?

415
00:23:42,367 --> 00:23:43,734
Where's he going?

416
00:23:43,801 --> 00:23:45,067
Probably to take a leak.

417
00:23:47,934 --> 00:23:50,434
Maybe that would be a good
time to go up to him, you know,

418
00:23:50,501 --> 00:23:53,200
without his whole group
around.

419
00:23:53,267 --> 00:23:55,367
And it would be--
it'd be casual.

420
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:58,033
Just two guys, like...

421
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,734
pissing... chatting.

422
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,701
Man, those hos
look good tonight.

423
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:12,634
Man, did you see that one with the
big Brazilian bubble-butt, man?

424
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:14,000
Man, she got a phat ass.

425
00:24:14,067 --> 00:24:16,267
Man, she looks gorgeous, man. Let's get it.

426
00:24:16,334 --> 00:24:18,767
I'm taking her home tonight. Her and her friend.

427
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,267
Fuck!

428
00:24:33,467 --> 00:24:35,300
Um... now what?

429
00:24:44,801 --> 00:24:47,167
A drink. We buy him a drink.

430
00:24:47,234 --> 00:24:49,133
We send a drink over.
We say

431
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,767
it's from the two gentlemen
in the corner.

432
00:24:50,834 --> 00:24:54,200
He waves us over to thank us,
and we hang out with him.

433
00:24:57,167 --> 00:24:58,100
Fuckin' genius.

434
00:24:58,167 --> 00:24:59,300
Right.

435
00:24:59,367 --> 00:25:00,934
How much money
you have left?

436
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,167
Uh... six bucks.

437
00:25:05,234 --> 00:25:06,434
All right. Give it here.

438
00:25:10,868 --> 00:25:12,167
Ma'am!

439
00:25:14,968 --> 00:25:16,968
No, man. I love
what I do, man.

440
00:25:29,534 --> 00:25:30,801
Oh, look.
That's our drink.

441
00:25:30,868 --> 00:25:32,000
She's bringing it.
She's bringing it!

442
00:25:32,067 --> 00:25:33,000
Screwdriver.

443
00:25:33,067 --> 00:25:34,000
Who?

444
00:25:34,067 --> 00:25:35,567
It's from them.
Who?

445
00:25:37,434 --> 00:25:39,167
Screwdriver?
I'm good, baby.

446
00:25:39,234 --> 00:25:40,400
Take it away?
Yeah, I'm good.

447
00:25:40,467 --> 00:25:42,834
Can you see? I can't see. Did he take it?

448
00:25:48,567 --> 00:25:49,801
I think so. Yeah.

449
00:26:00,734 --> 00:26:02,100
We should go there.

450
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,501
Shouldn't they--
Shouldn't they wave usover?

451
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:09,767
There's no ru--
There's no rule.

452
00:26:11,834 --> 00:26:12,934
There's no rules.

453
00:26:14,234 --> 00:26:15,267
Let's go.

454
00:26:15,334 --> 00:26:16,267
Let's go.

455
00:26:24,067 --> 00:26:25,868
That's what
I'm talking about!

456
00:26:29,267 --> 00:26:30,400
How many bottles you had?

457
00:26:30,467 --> 00:26:32,868
I bought about
30 bottles, man!

458
00:26:32,934 --> 00:26:34,067
Club-- Club QB!

459
00:26:34,133 --> 00:26:35,267
Club U.P., man.

460
00:26:40,601 --> 00:26:41,834
Hey.

461
00:26:44,434 --> 00:26:45,634
Yeah.

462
00:26:45,701 --> 00:26:46,634
Sex.

463
00:26:47,801 --> 00:26:48,734
Hey!

464
00:26:50,601 --> 00:26:51,634
Hey, men.

465
00:26:56,601 --> 00:26:58,100
There's somebody here
to see you, man.

466
00:26:58,167 --> 00:26:59,400
Yeah.

467
00:26:59,467 --> 00:27:00,767
Look at this
motherfucker!

468
00:27:00,834 --> 00:27:01,801
Yes.

469
00:27:05,634 --> 00:27:07,968
Yeah, and he brought the
Nutty Professor with him!

470
00:27:11,868 --> 00:27:14,434
We really wanted to just meet you, Mr. Bishop.

471
00:27:16,734 --> 00:27:18,534
Hi. Yeah, yeah. So how y'all doin', man?

472
00:27:18,601 --> 00:27:19,734
Doin' good, man.

473
00:27:19,801 --> 00:27:20,801
You all right,
man?

474
00:27:20,868 --> 00:27:22,033
Yeah,
I'm-- I'm great.

475
00:27:23,334 --> 00:27:25,634
We're big fans.
Yeah.

476
00:27:25,701 --> 00:27:28,467
15 sacks'll get you
big fans, man!

477
00:27:28,534 --> 00:27:30,400
QB, baby! QB!

478
00:27:30,467 --> 00:27:32,367
Hey, I told you
I have fans, man.

479
00:27:32,434 --> 00:27:34,367
See, I told you I have.
QB, man!

480
00:27:34,434 --> 00:27:36,300
We came all the way
from Staten Island.

481
00:27:36,367 --> 00:27:38,100
Staten Island!

482
00:27:40,167 --> 00:27:43,067
With a-- With a little stop in Stapleton.

483
00:27:43,133 --> 00:27:46,200
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh!
Wh-What?

484
00:27:46,267 --> 00:27:47,801
Say Stapleton?
Stapleton?

485
00:27:47,868 --> 00:27:49,834
Yeah. We were just...
um...

486
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:51,534
Were you following us?

487
00:27:55,701 --> 00:27:57,400
Stapleton.
Stapleton.

488
00:27:57,467 --> 00:27:59,801
Um, look, Q-- You following us or something?

489
00:27:59,868 --> 00:28:01,968
No, no! We-- We just
wanted to say hi, and then--

490
00:28:02,033 --> 00:28:04,133
I guess I kinda
chickened out, so I--

491
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,501
Look, we don't-- They're just fans, yo. Just fans.

492
00:28:05,567 --> 00:28:07,067
Bullshit! Bullshit!
No, not at all.

493
00:28:07,133 --> 00:28:09,834
If it's not a good time...

494
00:28:09,901 --> 00:28:12,567
They just fans. Bullshit! Hold on!
Bullshit! They're stalkers, man!

495
00:28:12,634 --> 00:28:14,834
Hold on. You a motherfucking stalker, man!

496
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:17,934
Bullshit! These two motherfuckin' stalker, man!

497
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,667
Fuck with me, man?
You motherfucker--

498
00:28:19,734 --> 00:28:21,100
Look, I'm very sorry--

499
00:28:21,167 --> 00:28:22,901
No! No!

500
00:28:22,968 --> 00:28:24,834
Motherfucker!

501
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,968
Fucker, man!

502
00:28:40,033 --> 00:28:41,167
Let me go, man!

503
00:28:53,734 --> 00:28:55,567
<i>Dr. Lyon, line 5145.</i>

504
00:28:55,634 --> 00:28:57,901
<i>Dr. Lyon, 5145.</i>

505
00:29:11,501 --> 00:29:15,133
<i>Any available</i>
<i>transport dispatcher, please.</i>

506
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,267
<i>Any available</i>
<i>transport dispatcher.</i>

507
00:29:33,934 --> 00:29:36,634
Hematoma.
It's a bleeding from the vein

508
00:29:36,701 --> 00:29:38,767
between the brain
and the skull.

509
00:29:38,834 --> 00:29:41,300
Fortunately, we were able
to successfully drain it.

510
00:29:42,767 --> 00:29:43,767
So I'm gonna be okay?

511
00:29:43,834 --> 00:29:45,501
You sustained
some pretty heavy trauma,

512
00:29:45,567 --> 00:29:47,067
but long-run,
you should be.

513
00:29:47,133 --> 00:29:50,400
We do need to keep you another
few days for observation.

514
00:29:50,467 --> 00:29:53,667
Another... few days?
How long have I been here?

515
00:29:53,734 --> 00:29:55,067
Three days.

516
00:29:55,133 --> 00:29:56,067
Three days.

517
00:29:58,634 --> 00:30:01,968
So... So the day is...

518
00:30:04,701 --> 00:30:05,934
Sunday?

519
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,033
Monday.

520
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,400
Monday.

521
00:30:11,467 --> 00:30:12,601
How did we do?

522
00:30:17,234 --> 00:30:18,667
What was the score?

523
00:30:18,734 --> 00:30:20,334
41-28.

524
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,601
We gave up 41
to the Chiefs?

525
00:30:31,567 --> 00:30:33,100
Did Quantrell...

526
00:30:35,634 --> 00:30:36,868
Suspended?

527
00:30:38,067 --> 00:30:39,000
Yeah.

528
00:30:39,067 --> 00:30:40,167
For how long?

529
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,267
Game-by-game basis.

530
00:30:44,334 --> 00:30:46,934
They say it depends
on the investigation.

531
00:30:59,234 --> 00:31:00,767
Paul.

532
00:31:00,834 --> 00:31:01,901
There's someone
here to see you.

533
00:31:03,601 --> 00:31:04,634
Thanks, doc.

534
00:31:04,701 --> 00:31:06,634
Hey, Paul.
How you doing?

535
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:10,534
I'm from Midtown South.
I, uh,

536
00:31:10,601 --> 00:31:13,467
just got a few questions for you
about what happened the other night.

537
00:31:16,701 --> 00:31:17,901
So, uh...

538
00:31:20,467 --> 00:31:22,734
...h-how does this...
Well, it's pretty simple.

539
00:31:22,801 --> 00:31:25,367
You, uh, tell us
everything that happened,

540
00:31:25,434 --> 00:31:27,400
and then we, uh, we nail
the son of a bitch.

541
00:31:27,467 --> 00:31:28,567
Put him in jail?

542
00:31:28,634 --> 00:31:29,767
That's the idea.

543
00:31:33,734 --> 00:31:36,100
How much time could he get?

544
00:31:36,167 --> 00:31:38,567
Aggravated assault,
maybe three to five.

545
00:31:38,634 --> 00:31:41,434
A-Aggravated assault?
That's what it would be.

546
00:31:41,501 --> 00:31:43,767
No, it really depends on what he did.
So why don't you just tell me

547
00:31:43,834 --> 00:31:45,868
what he did, and we'll take it from there.

548
00:31:47,901 --> 00:31:49,100
He, uh...

549
00:31:53,334 --> 00:31:56,434
Now, look, let's, uh,
let's keep it simple.

550
00:31:56,501 --> 00:31:58,434
Why don't you, uh,
start at the beginning.

551
00:31:58,501 --> 00:32:00,000
Tell me where you
first saw Quantrell.

552
00:32:00,067 --> 00:32:03,067
Quantrell. Quantrell,
I first, uh...

553
00:32:05,234 --> 00:32:06,167
Um...

554
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:15,834
I just-- I just don't know
how... reliable...

555
00:32:20,601 --> 00:32:22,701
I'll tell you what.

556
00:32:22,767 --> 00:32:23,934
You've been through a lot.

557
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,801
So, uh... you get some rest.

558
00:32:26,868 --> 00:32:28,434
We can try this again
in a couple days.

559
00:32:28,501 --> 00:32:30,033
That'd be good.
Great.

560
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:32,100
That'd be good.
I'm sure it'll start to come back to you.

561
00:32:32,167 --> 00:32:34,801
No, I hope so,
yeah. I hope so.

562
00:32:34,868 --> 00:32:37,133
All right.
Take it easy, buddy.

563
00:32:38,467 --> 00:32:39,501
You, too.

564
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,300
<i>Or even a medium fly on a honey pile,</i>

565
00:32:43,367 --> 00:32:45,968
<i>nuts and bolts.</i>
<i>Hold on.</i>

566
00:32:46,033 --> 00:32:49,167
<i>Don't put it in the trash.</i>
<i>Put it back together, and it's ready to go.</i>

567
00:32:49,234 --> 00:32:51,434
<i>But I saved</i>
<i>the best for last.</i>

568
00:32:51,501 --> 00:32:54,434
<i>If you have wooden floors</i>
<i>or tile floors,</i>

569
00:32:54,501 --> 00:32:57,501
<i>you have to change the</i>
<i>settings, you have to sweep.</i>

570
00:32:57,567 --> 00:33:00,334
<i>This is wet vegetables</i>
<i>on wood floors.</i>

571
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,701
<i>This could be tile.</i>

572
00:33:01,767 --> 00:33:03,701
<i>This could be waterproof.</i>

573
00:33:03,767 --> 00:33:06,934
<i>Look at this.</i>
<i>It sneaks behind.</i>

574
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,234
<i>It's not the tile.</i>

575
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:12,567
<i>Picks up the carrots,</i>
<i>the peas, the corn.</i>

576
00:33:12,634 --> 00:33:14,834
<i>It gets 'em all</i>
<i>in one easy step.</i>

577
00:34:00,067 --> 00:34:01,334
Just put a little salve
on there...

578
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,067
Because if that stuff
gets in your eye...

579
00:34:03,133 --> 00:34:05,400
It's not. It's not just in my eye. That's what I'm--

580
00:34:05,467 --> 00:34:06,701
There he is!
Hey...

581
00:34:06,767 --> 00:34:08,434
There goes my brother.
There he is.

582
00:34:08,501 --> 00:34:10,868
Ohh... Hello-o!

583
00:34:10,934 --> 00:34:12,767
Let me look. What a palace. Look at this.

584
00:34:12,834 --> 00:34:14,467
My brother's living in a palace. Hello.

585
00:34:14,534 --> 00:34:16,901
Not too bad, not too bad. Nice TV set...

586
00:34:16,968 --> 00:34:18,801
All right. Look at you. Better than I thought.

587
00:34:18,868 --> 00:34:21,734
You should get the shit
kicked out of you more often.

588
00:34:21,801 --> 00:34:23,200
Jeffrey.

589
00:34:23,267 --> 00:34:25,634
Speaking of which,
I've been thinking.

590
00:34:25,701 --> 00:34:28,033
Oh... oh.
That's never good!

591
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,501
What this animal did to you,
he's gotta pay.

592
00:34:30,567 --> 00:34:31,734
Yeah. I'm-- I'm sure he will.

593
00:34:31,801 --> 00:34:33,067
Well,
let's make sure of it.

594
00:34:33,133 --> 00:34:35,067
Well, the cops are investigating. So?

595
00:34:35,133 --> 00:34:37,701
So he's gonna go to jail!
Jail's bullshit.

596
00:34:37,767 --> 00:34:39,367
We gotta hit him where it hurts-- in his wallet.

597
00:34:39,434 --> 00:34:42,501
I don't wanna be one of those
assholes that sues Burger King

598
00:34:42,567 --> 00:34:44,667
for 50 billion because
their Whopper's too hot.

599
00:34:44,734 --> 00:34:47,000
We are not talking about
Whoppers here, Paul.

600
00:34:47,067 --> 00:34:50,767
We are talking about a rich,
spoiled, millionaire athlete

601
00:34:50,834 --> 00:34:53,934
who viciously beat an innocent
man within an inch of his life.

602
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,901
Do you not think, we,
as a society, have an obligation

603
00:34:56,968 --> 00:34:58,567
to hold its celebrities to the
same-- What's that thing

604
00:34:58,634 --> 00:35:01,100
where instead of saying
"won't," you say "will not"?

605
00:35:01,167 --> 00:35:03,634
Or instead of saying
"can't," you say "cannot"?

606
00:35:04,868 --> 00:35:06,234
Contractions?

607
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:09,133
You stop using them whenever
you want to sound smart

608
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,767
or lawyerly-- Don't be a fuckin' wise ass, Paul!
This is serious!

609
00:35:11,834 --> 00:35:13,133
You should
listen to him.

610
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,267
You don't care about justice.
You just want money.

611
00:35:15,334 --> 00:35:18,167
Money isjustice.
We're talking aggravated assault and battery--

612
00:35:18,234 --> 00:35:19,534
3, 4 million easy.

613
00:35:19,601 --> 00:35:22,234
Wow. So now you're
a lawyer. That's--

614
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:24,667
Boy, the things they teach in secretary school.
Fuck you!

615
00:35:24,734 --> 00:35:27,033
He don't give a shit about you.
But I don't wanna sue.

616
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,567
What the fuck's wrong with you? That's enough.

617
00:35:29,634 --> 00:35:31,100
Thickheaded motherfucker,
you are.

618
00:35:31,167 --> 00:35:32,767
What is wrong with you?
This motherfucker

619
00:35:32,834 --> 00:35:34,601
does not give
a fuck about you.

620
00:35:34,667 --> 00:35:37,200
He is in his mansion playing his Xbox.
You never listen.

621
00:35:37,267 --> 00:35:38,701
That's because no one ever
says anything worth listening to.

622
00:35:38,767 --> 00:35:40,133
Look at where you are! This is a hospital.

623
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,300
It's not what you want.
It's what is right.

624
00:35:41,367 --> 00:35:42,634
You wanna live like this
for the rest of your life?

625
00:35:42,701 --> 00:35:44,501
Yes, I do. I wanna
live exactly like this.

626
00:35:47,434 --> 00:35:49,667
I had enough of this.
Good.

627
00:35:49,734 --> 00:35:51,267
Oi.

628
00:35:54,834 --> 00:35:57,334
How do you get a concussion
when you got no fuckin' brains?

629
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,634

00:38:57,968 --> 00:39:00,434
Hey, Dogg, how you doing?
Um, listen,

659
00:39:00,501 --> 00:39:04,934
I'm just calling in response to
that pea-brain Philadelphia Phil.

660
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,033
I'm listening here.
It's unbelievable!

661
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:11,234
I mean, you ever hear of
innocent until proved guilty?

662
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,767
It's a little thing called
the American Constitution.

663
00:39:13,834 --> 00:39:15,567
Maybe you should look it up.

664
00:39:15,634 --> 00:39:19,467
Now, we don't know what happened at that club.
We weren't there!

665
00:39:19,534 --> 00:39:21,234
I mean, maybe-- maybe...

666
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,467
unless-- unless they
charge QB with something,

667
00:39:23,534 --> 00:39:25,501
they gotta let him play.
They gotta let him play.

668
00:39:25,567 --> 00:39:27,934
Not that we need him...

669
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,801
because we got the horses,
and everything's cool.

670
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:31,968
This is-- You know
what this is?

671
00:39:32,033 --> 00:39:33,968
This is people
blowing something

672
00:39:34,033 --> 00:39:36,033
way out of proportion,
all right?

673
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:40,100
And not realizing that th--
this thing is not a thing.

674
00:39:41,534 --> 00:39:42,701
<i>Yeeaahh.</i>

675
00:40:05,067 --> 00:40:06,000
Hey, Paul.

676
00:40:09,634 --> 00:40:10,567
Feeling better?

677
00:40:12,067 --> 00:40:13,801
Yeah, I'm fine.
You know.

678
00:40:16,067 --> 00:40:18,067
This is a good time
to talk?

679
00:40:18,133 --> 00:40:20,300
Uh, it's not, uh... ideal.

680
00:40:21,734 --> 00:40:22,767
I got work.

681
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:26,901
What time
you get off?

682
00:40:26,968 --> 00:40:27,901
I don't...

683
00:40:29,567 --> 00:40:32,000
really know how much I can help you on this,
you know?

684
00:40:32,067 --> 00:40:34,300
Any help is help, Paul.

685
00:40:35,367 --> 00:40:38,033
Yeah. You know,
I think maybe...

686
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,601
You know, I think
I got amnesia.

687
00:40:42,767 --> 00:40:44,033
Amnesia.

688
00:40:54,467 --> 00:40:57,100
Yeah. Sounds
like you have amnesia.

689
00:40:58,834 --> 00:41:02,534
Is there-- Isn't there anyone else
you could talk to about this, or...

690
00:41:02,601 --> 00:41:04,734
You'd think so.

691
00:41:04,801 --> 00:41:07,434
A club that crowded.
But unfortunately, you know,

692
00:41:07,501 --> 00:41:10,367
everyone was either off in the
bathroom or the VIP lounge

693
00:41:10,434 --> 00:41:12,667
or havin' a smoke
when it all went down.

694
00:41:12,734 --> 00:41:13,834
Hmm. Well...

695
00:41:17,133 --> 00:41:20,601
Well... let's hope
that amnesia clears up.

696
00:41:22,534 --> 00:41:24,234
When it does, I want you
to give me a call.

697
00:41:27,167 --> 00:41:29,734
We wouldn't want a crime
like this to go unpunished.

698
00:41:31,334 --> 00:41:32,267
No.

699
00:41:43,067 --> 00:41:44,567
<i>Man, these Giants</i>
<i>are killin' me.</i>

700
00:41:44,634 --> 00:41:46,567
<i>I think I might have to</i>
<i>start watchin' the Jets.</i>

701
00:41:46,634 --> 00:41:47,734
<i>This is killin' me.</i>

702
00:41:47,801 --> 00:41:49,434
<i>Yeah,</i>
<i>I can feel you, Chuck.</i>

703
00:41:49,501 --> 00:41:51,968
<i>You can't tell me this</i>
<i>isn't botherin' the Giants.</i>

704
00:41:52,033 --> 00:41:55,033
<i>You can't tell me that this</i>
<i>isn't driving Coughlin nuts.</i>

705
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:58,434
<i>I mean, it's become a problem</i>
<i>that they've had to deal with</i>

706
00:41:58,501 --> 00:42:00,467
<i>day in, day out,</i>
<i>week to week.</i>

707
00:42:00,534 --> 00:42:04,167
<i>I don't even know how they maintain</i>
<i>their focus with this nightmare goin' on.</i>

708
00:42:04,234 --> 00:42:07,300
<i>The drama keeps playin' out,</i>
<i>the story's had legs forever.</i>

709
00:42:07,367 --> 00:42:09,734
<i>It won't go away. They haven't</i>
<i>made their minds up.</i>

710
00:42:09,801 --> 00:42:12,067
<i>The D.A. doesn't know</i>
<i>whether he's comin' or goin'.</i>

711
00:42:12,133 --> 00:42:14,000
<i>I mean, the D.A.'s office</i>
<i>gotta make their mind up.</i>

712
00:42:14,067 --> 00:42:15,901
<i>They can't let this thing</i>
<i>keep dragging out--</i>

713
00:42:15,968 --> 00:42:18,634
<i>Wait a minute, wait a minute.</i>
<i>We got breakin' news on this very subject.</i>

714
00:42:18,701 --> 00:42:20,734
<i>Let's go to Ed Rosen</i>
<i>right now.</i>

715
00:42:20,801 --> 00:42:22,400
<i>Well, Dogg, word has come down</i>

716
00:42:22,467 --> 00:42:25,834
<i>that Quantrell Bishop</i>
<i>will not be eligible to play</i>

717
00:42:25,901 --> 00:42:28,133
<i>in this Sunday's</i>
<i>key showdown in Dallas.</i>

718
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,834
<i>According</i> to
<i>a Giants' spokesman,</i>

719
00:42:29,901 --> 00:42:33,634
<i>the five-time pro-bowler will</i>
<i>remain on the ineligible list</i>

720
00:42:33,701 --> 00:42:35,234
<i>until further notice.</i>

721
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:38,968
<i>Once again, Quantrell Bishop</i>
<i>inactive this Sunday.</i>

722
00:42:39,033 --> 00:42:40,467
<i>That's it</i>
<i>from the Meadowlands,</i>

723
00:42:40,534 --> 00:42:44,234
<i>Ed Rosen on the Giants beat, 760, The Zone.</i>

724
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:47,067
<i>The Cowboys come</i>
<i>in with the number 3 ranked offense--</i>

725
00:42:47,133 --> 00:42:48,734
<i>first in the pass,</i>
<i>last in the run--</i>

726
00:42:48,801 --> 00:42:50,133
<i>led, of course, by Marion Barber.</i>
We're really good.

727
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,200
We're in good shape.
You slide Pierce over,

728
00:42:52,267 --> 00:42:53,534
you give Michael
some support, bada-bing,

729
00:42:53,601 --> 00:42:54,968
we're good.
Yeah.

730
00:42:55,033 --> 00:42:56,667
<i>And I see the Cowboys</i>
<i>trying to establish the run</i>

731
00:42:56,734 --> 00:43:00,234
<i>early and often today with the</i>
<i>absence of Quantrell Bishop.</i>

732
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:03,834
<i>Giants come in today,</i>
<i>a little shaky off of last week's loss, looking to...</i>

733
00:43:03,901 --> 00:43:05,033
No problem.

734
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:08,467
<i>This is gonna be a tough</i>
<i>contest and a tough--</i>

735
00:43:08,534 --> 00:43:11,267
What the fuck?!

736
00:43:11,334 --> 00:43:13,834
<i>The Cowboys 35</i>
<i>and the Giants 27.</i>

737
00:43:13,901 --> 00:43:16,434
<i>And, Chip, just like we talked</i>
<i>about before the game...</i> Fuck.

738
00:43:16,501 --> 00:43:19,601
<i>the Giants' defensive...</i>
You don't go for two when you're down four.

739
00:43:19,667 --> 00:43:22,200
<i>He had all day to pass,</i>
<i>and he made them pay.</i>

740
00:43:22,267 --> 00:43:24,000
You miss, you need
a touchdown to win!

741
00:43:24,067 --> 00:43:26,501
<i>...the Giants, but</i>
<i>without Quantrell Bishop...</i>

742
00:43:26,567 --> 00:43:29,701
The first-and-goal, you cannot take a sack there.

743
00:43:29,767 --> 00:43:30,801
Throw that shit away!

744
00:43:30,868 --> 00:43:32,267
<i>...way of the Giants'</i>
<i>defense,</i>

745
00:43:32,334 --> 00:43:33,634
<i>specifically attacking the spot</i>
It never should have come

746
00:43:33,701 --> 00:43:36,267
to that. <i>Quantrell Bishop normally occupies.</i>

747
00:43:36,334 --> 00:43:38,734
<i>Willington with an admirable</i>
<i>job at defensive end today,</i>

748
00:43:38,801 --> 00:43:40,267
We're fine. <i>but he is not Quantrell Bishop.</i>

749
00:43:40,334 --> 00:43:42,267
We only need to win
one of the next two,

750
00:43:42,334 --> 00:43:44,200
<i>...right from the get-go.</i>
or they lose one.

751
00:43:44,267 --> 00:43:45,467
<i>...Quantrell Bishop? You mean...</i>
They got, uh,

752
00:43:45,534 --> 00:43:47,567
Green Bay
at Lambeau.

753
00:43:47,634 --> 00:43:49,501
We're good.
We're fine.

754
00:43:49,567 --> 00:43:51,767
<i>...got right in there and stole</i>
<i>everything in the house.</i>

755
00:43:51,834 --> 00:43:54,601
<i>And, Chip, as we turn to the
NFC East race now,</i> You okay?

756
00:43:54,667 --> 00:43:57,267
<i>the Philadelphia Eagles are gaining</i>
<i>on the New York Football Giants,</i>

757
00:43:57,334 --> 00:43:59,901
<i>and it looked at one point as if we
had no race,</i> You know what, man?

758
00:43:59,968 --> 00:44:02,534
<i>but now, Chip, I think we have a</i>
<i>certifiable dogfight on our hands.</i>

759
00:44:02,601 --> 00:44:04,367
You really need
to lay off this shit.

760
00:44:04,434 --> 00:44:06,667
<i>Three weeks ago,</i>
<i>it looked like the Giants had firm control</i>

761
00:44:06,734 --> 00:44:09,000
<i>of the division.</i>
This is alien piss.

762
00:44:09,067 --> 00:44:12,067
<i>...walk away with this thing and now,
all of a sudden...</i> Can I make a suggestion?

763
00:44:12,133 --> 00:44:15,934
Drink this stuff.
It's much better for you. Root beer.

764
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,033
<i>...excessive problems,</i>
<i>they might buy-- they might be...</i>

765
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:20,701
This is root... beer.
<i>When it comes down to the wire, Chip...</i>

766
00:44:20,767 --> 00:44:24,467
Root beer.
It's like-- It's like earth's first beverage.

767
00:44:24,534 --> 00:44:25,968
I don't like root beer.

768
00:44:26,033 --> 00:44:29,834
Anything in a green bottle
is gonna kill you. Brown.

769
00:44:29,901 --> 00:44:31,467

<i>You hear that, baby?</i>

00:46:55,801 --> 00:46:57,334
How you doing,
Paul?

787
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:58,467
Hey!

788
00:46:58,534 --> 00:47:00,267
Ohh...
It's cold out, huh?

789
00:47:00,334 --> 00:47:01,434
Mmhh!

790
00:47:01,501 --> 00:47:02,901
Coffee?
Please.

791
00:47:06,667 --> 00:47:07,601
Thank you.

792
00:47:08,667 --> 00:47:10,801
Well... gotta be honest.

793
00:47:13,501 --> 00:47:14,901
Did not expect
to hear from you.

794
00:47:14,968 --> 00:47:16,567
Well...

795
00:47:17,801 --> 00:47:18,734
So.

796
00:47:21,667 --> 00:47:23,000
What do you got for me?

797
00:47:23,067 --> 00:47:25,467
Well, you know,
I've been, uh...

798
00:47:26,834 --> 00:47:30,367
...thinkin' a lot about...
what happened, and--

799
00:47:30,434 --> 00:47:31,934
and, you know...

800
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,567
trying to remember.

801
00:47:33,634 --> 00:47:34,968
Bring it.

802
00:47:35,033 --> 00:47:36,567
I just...

803
00:47:38,033 --> 00:47:39,133
I don't think...

804
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,701
that I'll, uh...

805
00:47:42,467 --> 00:47:43,701
be able...

806
00:47:48,868 --> 00:47:52,100
...to r-remember stuff.
I've been trying, you know,

807
00:47:52,167 --> 00:47:56,701
really hard, thinking about...
what happened, and I ju--

808
00:47:56,767 --> 00:47:59,267
I just can't-- I-- I just can't.

809
00:48:02,534 --> 00:48:04,767
Can't remember
or won't remember?

810
00:48:04,834 --> 00:48:09,133
I've been trying... like I said... um, to remember.

811
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:11,167
I just-- I can't...

812
00:48:11,234 --> 00:48:12,567

I'm sorry.

815
00:48:35,734 --> 00:48:37,834
Coulda told me this
over the fuckin' phone.

816
00:49:22,467 --> 00:49:23,701
Mmphh...

817
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:37,334
Bro, you okay?

818
00:49:38,868 --> 00:49:39,801
So, how you
feeling, bro?

819
00:49:42,467 --> 00:49:44,033
I'm pretty good.
Pretty good.

820
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:45,567
What'd
the doctor say?

821
00:49:45,634 --> 00:49:48,601
Oh, they don't know
what happened.

822
00:49:48,667 --> 00:49:50,067
They did
another CAT scan?

823
00:49:51,434 --> 00:49:54,167
Yeah. It didn't
show anything.

824
00:49:54,234 --> 00:49:56,334
Oh, really? It didn't pick up the fist prints?
They're not related.

825
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:57,701
Yeah. Sure.

826
00:49:57,767 --> 00:50:00,000
You don't know that.
Are you sniffing glue again?

827
00:50:00,067 --> 00:50:02,701
Is this like some kind of no-snitching thing?
Like the brothers?

828
00:50:02,767 --> 00:50:06,634
Oh, yeah. I heard the charges were dropped.
I'm sorry. You must be really upset about that.

829
00:50:06,701 --> 00:50:08,033
Come on, Jeff.

830
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:10,133
What? I'm sympathizing.
Well, stop.

831
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:11,601
He needs to hear this.

832
00:50:11,667 --> 00:50:13,334
He needs his rest.
He needs to get better.

833
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:15,067
Look at you.
He's right.

834
00:50:15,133 --> 00:50:16,200
Like a jadrool. Oh, please be quiet.

835
00:50:16,267 --> 00:50:17,634
Fuckin' jadrool.
Oh, my God.

836
00:50:17,701 --> 00:50:19,400
You're not gonna get through to him.

844
00:50:57,067 --> 00:50:59,000
<i>Get off the porch!</i>

845
00:50:59,067 --> 00:51:02,100
<i>You're in The Zone</i>
<i>with the Sports Dogg,</i>

846
00:51:02,167 --> 00:51:04,701
<i>on 760 Sports Radio,</i>
<i>New York.</i>

847
00:51:04,767 --> 00:51:06,000
<i>New York...</i>

848
00:51:06,067 --> 00:51:07,300
<i>Hey,</i>
<i>Paul From Staten Island,</i>

849
00:51:07,367 --> 00:51:08,367
<i>what do we got tonight?</i> Hey! Hey!

850
00:51:08,434 --> 00:51:10,834
What's up, Dogg?
Um, I gotta tell you,

851
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:12,868
I am feeling
good tonight

852
00:51:12,934 --> 00:51:15,334
because in a little less than 48 hours,

853
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:19,367
we are gonna brutally shatter any flicker of hope

854
00:51:19,434 --> 00:51:21,467
the cheesesteaks had going.

855
00:51:21,534 --> 00:51:23,901
We've been messing
with them the last few weeks,

856
00:51:23,968 --> 00:51:26,501
letting 'em get back in it
a little, making 'em think

857
00:51:26,567 --> 00:51:28,334
they had
a chance of catching us

858
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,534
just so we can see
the look on their faces

859
00:51:30,601 --> 00:51:32,534
when they come up short.

860
00:51:32,601 --> 00:51:35,801
Quantrell's back, baby,
and he is g-- Paul!

861
00:51:38,767 --> 00:51:40,400
Quantrell is back, baby,

862
00:51:40,467 --> 00:51:44,133
and he is ready to make up
for some lost time

863
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:45,601
against the Panthers.

864
00:51:45,667 --> 00:51:49,067
You better hope the scoreboard
is broken down there in St. Louis

865
00:51:49,133 --> 00:51:52,400
because the Eagles
are gonna be so crushed

866
00:51:52,467 --> 00:51:55,234
when they look up at it and see
the Giants-Panthers score.

867
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:57,601
They're not even gonna
be able to play.

868
00:51:57,667 --> 00:52:02,167
It's not even-- even gonna come down
to the head-to-head in week 17.

869
00:52:02,234 --> 00:52:04,834
We're gonna wrap
up the East in a nice little bow

870
00:52:04,901 --> 00:52:07,534
this coming-- People live here!

871
00:52:07,601 --> 00:52:09,000
Sorry. Sorry.

872
00:52:10,234 --> 00:52:13,868
This coming weekend,
after which, we will follow

873
00:52:13,934 --> 00:52:16,300
<i>our pre-destiny</i>
<i>to the Super Bowl</i>

874
00:52:16,367 --> 00:52:20,567
<i>as we ride the victory bus</i>
<i>to the championship.</i>

875
00:52:20,634 --> 00:52:23,534
And why? Why are we riding
in the victory bus

876
00:52:23,601 --> 00:52:26,100
to a championship
we haven't played?

877
00:52:26,167 --> 00:52:28,267
Because, as I said earlier,

878
00:52:28,334 --> 00:52:32,767
it is pre-destiny that we will
take the Super Bowl this year

879
00:52:32,834 --> 00:52:37,667
while at the same time
waving goodbye

880
00:52:37,734 --> 00:52:40,000
to... the... Eagles.

881
00:52:40,067 --> 00:52:42,300
<i>Thanks, Paul. Now,</i>
<i>that's a G-Men fan.</i>

882
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:43,834
Oh-- Thank you. <i>Thanks, buddy. </i>

883
00:52:43,901 --> 00:52:46,767
All ri-- Okay. Thanks,
Sports Dogg. Thank you.

884
00:53:02,834 --> 00:53:03,767
Boom.

885
00:53:10,834 --> 00:53:12,868
<i>Delhomme in the shotgun...</i>

886
00:53:12,934 --> 00:53:15,801
Big stop, big stop,
big stop, big stop.

887
00:53:15,868 --> 00:53:18,434
Go get him! Get him! Fuck!
<i>...breaks into a wide open...</i>

888
00:53:18,501 --> 00:53:20,133
<i>...hauls it in</i>
<i>at the 31 yard line...</i>

889
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:21,567
He had all day
back there.

890
00:53:21,634 --> 00:53:23,300
<i>And here</i>
<i>come the Panthers...</i>

891
00:53:23,367 --> 00:53:24,367
That's all right.

892
00:53:24,434 --> 00:53:26,467
The Panthers
always self-destruct.

893
00:53:26,534 --> 00:53:28,133
<i>...right out of the air</i>
<i>into his hands</i>

894
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:29,601
<i>and another first down.</i>

895
00:53:29,667 --> 00:53:31,067
<i>That's the sixth ball</i>
<i>he's caught today,</i>

896
00:53:31,133 --> 00:53:33,300
<i>and we're not even</i>
<i>in the second half.</i>

897
00:53:33,367 --> 00:53:35,300
<i>Steve Smith,</i>
<i>one of the players Coach Coughlin said</i>

898
00:53:35,367 --> 00:53:37,901
<i>the Giants had to stop.</i>
<i>The Giants with no answer--</i>

899
00:53:37,968 --> 00:53:41,234
<i>Jim Trainor, saying so long</i>
<i>from Giants Stadium.</i>

900
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:44,167
<i>Panthers 28, Giants 7--</i>

901
00:53:48,567 --> 00:53:50,234
You can't blame
the defense for this one.

902
00:53:55,734 --> 00:53:57,067
Panthers
got some weapons.

903
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,167
Quantrell played like shit.

904
00:54:02,901 --> 00:54:04,234
Well, he was
double-teamed.

905
00:54:09,067 --> 00:54:10,434
He was rusty.

906
00:54:13,501 --> 00:54:15,634
<i>Tied for first place!</i>

907
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:19,033
<i>Tied for first place!</i>

908
00:54:20,567 --> 00:54:22,367
<i>Tied for first place!</i>

909
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,801
<i>Hey, oh, oh, and one more thing I'd like to add.</i>

910
00:54:26,868 --> 00:54:28,968
<i>Tied for first place!</i>

911
00:54:48,133 --> 00:54:49,067
Huh.

912
00:54:55,968 --> 00:54:57,133
What's so funny?

913
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:04,501
You must have the world's biggest
collection of Chinese packets.

914
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:09,234
It's a sin to throw out food.

915
00:55:16,167 --> 00:55:18,767
My mother,
the soy-sauce squirrel.

916
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,734
It's a real riot,
not being wasteful.

917
00:55:26,834 --> 00:55:29,267
You know what's a riot?

918
00:55:29,334 --> 00:55:32,100
Is you spending 20 years

919
00:55:32,167 --> 00:55:33,868
collecting
all these sauce packets

920
00:55:33,934 --> 00:55:35,934
that you're never
gonna use. That's a riot.

921
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,734
You're a sick boy, you know
that, Paul? You need help.

922
00:55:38,801 --> 00:55:41,601
Yeah. And you need
6,000 egg rolls.

923
00:55:41,667 --> 00:55:43,400
To put all that stuff on!

924
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,300
Hello?

925
00:56:02,367 --> 00:56:05,300
<i>Good evening.</i>
<i>Is, uh, Paul home?</i>

926
00:56:05,367 --> 00:56:07,434
Uh, may I say who's calling?

927
00:56:07,501 --> 00:56:10,801
<i>This is Murray Pape.</i>
<i>I'm calling from the</i> Daily News.

928
00:56:10,868 --> 00:56:13,467
Uh, he's not here right now.
May I take a message?

929
00:56:13,534 --> 00:56:16,634
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>I'd just like to ask him a few quick questions...</i>

930
00:56:16,701 --> 00:56:18,067
<i>about the lawsuit.</i>

931
00:56:18,133 --> 00:56:20,400
<i>If you could, I'd really appreciate--</i> Lawsuit?

932
00:56:40,567 --> 00:56:42,167
Yeah. Excuse me.

933
00:56:42,234 --> 00:56:43,534
Paul, what the fuck?

934
00:56:43,601 --> 00:56:45,834
Paul. Paul. Paul.

935
00:56:45,901 --> 00:56:49,634
Hello? Hello?
Paul. Paul. Paul.

936
00:56:52,434 --> 00:56:56,334
"In an unexpected turn of events,
the lawyer for alleged--"

937
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,234
I'm taking a fuckin' dump here! "The lawyer

938
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:01,834
"for alleged Quantrell Bishop
beating victim Paul Aufiero

939
00:57:01,901 --> 00:57:04,968
yesterday filed
a $77 million lawsuit--"

940
00:57:05,033 --> 00:57:07,434
Can we discuss this
after I wipe my ass?

941
00:57:07,501 --> 00:57:09,167
"...against the star
linebacker in federal court

942
00:57:09,234 --> 00:57:10,834
on behalf of his client"?

943
00:57:10,901 --> 00:57:12,901
Jeff, what the fuck?
I'm acting in your best interests.

944
00:57:12,968 --> 00:57:14,334
You're not seeing
things clearly here.

945
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:16,901
You have no right.
I have a right if you're my brother

946
00:57:16,968 --> 00:57:18,968
and you're not mentally competent
to make decisions for yourself.

947
00:57:19,033 --> 00:57:21,300
I'm mentally competent!
You're a 36-year-old man

948
00:57:21,367 --> 00:57:22,901
who lives home
with his mother,

949
00:57:22,968 --> 00:57:24,801
who depends on her for food,
for laundry,

950
00:57:24,868 --> 00:57:26,901
and countless basic fuckin'
life necessities. All right?

951
00:57:26,968 --> 00:57:29,767
On paper you're basically a fuckin' vegetable!
Oh, fuck you!

952
00:57:29,834 --> 00:57:31,100
It's true!
You can't do this!

953
00:57:31,167 --> 00:57:33,033
I just did.
I--

954
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:36,334
Where the fuck did you get $77 million from?

955
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:38,033
I calculated it.
Yeah, outta your ass.

956
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:40,367
I know you're a fan of this guy,
but you gotta stop looking at him

957
00:57:40,434 --> 00:57:42,701
as some kind of fuckin' hero
and start looking at him

958
00:57:42,767 --> 00:57:45,133
as some big, black,
moulinyan jack-off asshole

959
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:46,968
that gave you brain damage!
Hey, my brain's fine.

960
00:57:47,033 --> 00:57:48,100
Yeah.
You--

961
00:57:48,167 --> 00:57:50,334
It was an accident.

962
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,801
The whole thing was a misunderstanding.
A misunderstanding?

963
00:57:52,868 --> 00:57:54,567
He was drunk!
That's no excuse.

964
00:57:54,634 --> 00:57:57,934
He-- I was bothering him.
Okay? He-- He was out

965
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,968
trying to have a good time with his friends.
Do you hear yourself?

966
00:58:00,033 --> 00:58:01,567
Do you actually
hear yourself?

967
00:58:01,634 --> 00:58:03,000
Lots of people
get beat up every day.

968
00:58:03,067 --> 00:58:04,534
I don't see you out there
suing for them.

969
00:58:04,601 --> 00:58:06,100
Well, none of them
are my brother. Okay?

970
00:58:06,167 --> 00:58:08,567
And for what it's worth, the
whole family supports it. Okay?

971
00:58:08,634 --> 00:58:11,400
Gina, Mom, Dennis, Christine, everybody.
For what it's worth,

972
00:58:11,467 --> 00:58:12,534
I'm not gonna
let you do it.

973
00:58:12,601 --> 00:58:14,133
Go ahead, stop me.
I will.

974
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:15,501
Go for it.

975
00:58:18,133 --> 00:58:19,767
Can I finish
my shit now?

976
00:58:30,667 --> 00:58:31,801
Can I borrow your Internet?

977
00:58:45,033 --> 00:58:47,934
Maybe "Stopping
a lawsuit"?

978
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:00,434
Man, they usually have
everything on there.

979
00:59:03,367 --> 00:59:06,467
Maybe the lawyers don't want
that information public.

980
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:09,868
Yeah,
that makes sense.

981
00:59:23,901 --> 00:59:25,767

<i>Yeah,</i>

1080
01:03:53,901 --> 01:03:55,501
<i>I can dig it.</i>

1081
01:03:55,567 --> 01:03:58,000
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>
<i>Oh, this is gonna be a huge call.</i>

1082
01:03:58,067 --> 01:04:02,734
<i>Line one, a world exclusive,</i>
<i>Paul from Staten Island.</i>

1083
01:04:02,801 --> 01:04:04,367
Hey, Sports Dogg.
How you doing?

1084
01:04:04,434 --> 01:04:05,801
<i>Hey! What's up,</i>
<i>Paul, man?</i>

1085
01:04:05,868 --> 01:04:07,801
<i>A lot of people have been</i>
<i>talkin' about you, brother.</i>

1086
01:04:07,868 --> 01:04:10,434
I know. And, uh,
I just wanted to say...

1087
01:04:10,501 --> 01:04:13,133
a-- a, uh, a lot of people

1088
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:15,234
have been talking
about me these days,

1089
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:17,267
and most of it is wrong.

1090
01:04:17,334 --> 01:04:20,467
So it's time I cleared
the record straight.

1091
01:04:20,534 --> 01:04:23,601
First off, with regarding
the alleged incident

1092
01:04:23,667 --> 01:04:25,868
between me
and Quantrell Bishop

1093
01:04:25,934 --> 01:04:29,734
on November 30th,
this was not an attack.

1094
01:04:29,801 --> 01:04:31,934
It was an unfortunate misunder-- Paul.

1095
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:35,934
It was an unfortunate misunderstanding

1096
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,534
between the two of us.

1097
01:04:37,601 --> 01:04:39,300
He did nothing-- Who are you talking to?

1098
01:04:40,868 --> 01:04:43,968
He did nothing wrong,
and I have no plans to sue.

1099
01:04:44,033 --> 01:04:46,300
The lawsuit
was accidentally filed

1100
01:04:46,367 --> 01:04:48,100
by a person in my family

1101
01:04:48,167 --> 01:04:50,000
who misunderstood the
situ-- <i> Paul, I have had it.</i>

1102
01:04:52,734 --> 01:04:54,534
Uh, get off the phone,
please?

1103
01:04:54,601 --> 01:04:57,167
<i>I have to be up</i>
<i>at 7:30.</i>

1104
01:04:57,234 --> 01:04:58,501
Hang up.

1105
01:04:58,567 --> 01:05:00,334
<i>Who is that?</i>

1106
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:03,667
<i>I have a doctor's appointment at 9.</i>

1107
01:05:03,734 --> 01:05:04,667
Okay.

1108
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:06,467
<i>It's surgery, Paul.</i>

1109
01:05:06,534 --> 01:05:07,901
<i>Is that his mother?</i>

1110
01:05:07,968 --> 01:05:10,234
<i>They're removing</i>
<i>my corn.</i>

1111
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:12,167
<i>If I don't get a good night's--</i> Fucking hang up

<i>No F-bombs, dude.</i>

<i>You know that.</i>
<i>I gotta let you go.</i>

Hello!

1117

Why are you
doing this to me?

1118
01:05:24,234 --> 01:05:26,400
I'm not doing nothing to you!
You do it all to yourself!

1119
01:05:26,467 --> 01:05:27,701
I'm sick of you
treating me like a baby!

1120

No, you're not!
Hey, I think I would know!

1125

Happy is family,
children!

1126

Oh, says you!
Says everybody!

1127
01:05:41,300 --> 01:05:44,067
There's basic stuff every person needs!
Oh, don't--

1128
01:05:44,133 --> 01:05:46,267
Your brother has 'em,
your sister has 'em, only you!

1129
01:05:46,334 --> 01:05:48,834
Hey! Hey! No! No! I don't want what they've got!

1130
01:05:48,901 --> 01:05:52,000
I don't want it! I don't want it! I don't want it!

We get to Wisconsin,

1165
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:13,167
as we're driving across the bridge into
Wisconsin. It was like a conquest.

1166

Right. We get to Wisconsin, he says,

1167
01:13:15,334 --> 01:13:17,334
"Hey, can you drive a stick?"
And I was like, "Huh?"

1168
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:20,434
I'm like, "Dude, I can drive a stick."

1169
01:13:20,501 --> 01:13:22,067
And he fucked her
in the back?

1170
01:13:22,133 --> 01:13:23,701
He fucked her in the back seat, but first,

1171
01:13:23,767 --> 01:13:25,934
the lady goes, "Fricking huge!"

1172
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,400
That was
frickin' huge.

1173
01:13:28,767 --> 01:13:31,133
That was big.
That was big for us.

1174
01:13:33,234 --> 01:13:35,467
Let's go on.
Bring it fuckin' home.

1175
01:13:35,534 --> 01:13:36,901
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

1176
01:13:40,901 --> 01:13:42,634
This is what you call
a game turner.

1177
01:13:44,167 --> 01:13:46,601
It's called a game "changer," you motherfucker.

1178
01:13:46,667 --> 01:13:47,701
Phil!

1179
01:13:52,100 --> 01:13:53,801

Let's go, let's go, let's go.
What you gonna do? Come on!

1181
01:13:58,801 --> 01:14:00,000
Throw it up his ass! Phil!

1182
01:14:00,067 --> 01:14:01,000
Let's go!

1183
01:14:07,434 --> 01:14:09,834
Yeah, you fuckin' asshole!

1184
01:14:09,901 --> 01:14:11,267
Yes! Oh, yes!

1185
01:14:11,334 --> 01:14:13,534
That's what I'm talking about! Yes.

1186
01:14:13,601 --> 01:14:15,534
That's what
I'm talking about!

1187
01:14:18,067 --> 01:14:19,734
Whoo!

1188
01:14:19,801 --> 01:14:21,334
We got this.
We got this.

1189
01:14:22,467 --> 01:14:24,000
Take away that bullshit
fumble call,

1190
01:14:24,067 --> 01:14:25,434
we'd be up 14.

1191
01:14:25,501 --> 01:14:27,701
Yeah, you know what?
Not to worry. It's about to get ugly.

1192
01:14:27,767 --> 01:14:29,167
Yeah, it's gonna
get fuckin' ugly.

1193
01:14:29,234 --> 01:14:30,234
Yeah.

1194
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:31,901
How's it going, bo?
Phil.

1195
01:14:31,968 --> 01:14:32,901
Oh. Mark.

1196
01:14:32,968 --> 01:14:34,667
How's it going?
Good, good.

1197
01:14:34,734 --> 01:14:36,601
I like the paint. You got your colors, right?

1198
01:14:36,667 --> 01:14:38,367
I'm flyin'

1199
01:14:38,434 --> 01:14:40,434
He's got his fucking colors on.
Fly them, man. Fly 'em.

Fuckin' queers. Douche, douche.

Douche, douche.

1204
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:56,067
Now-- Now I just want it to become, like,
an annihilation.

1205
01:14:56,133 --> 01:14:58,434
Like, I just want it
to become an abomination,

1206
01:14:58,501 --> 01:15:00,534
an annihilation,
a murder,

1207
01:15:00,601 --> 01:15:02,234
a mass fuckin' murder!

1208
01:15:02,300 --> 01:15:04,367
You fuck.

1209
01:15:05,801 --> 01:15:08,601
I want to mass fuckin' murder,

1343
01:23:14,667 --> 01:23:15,601
Hey.

1344
01:23:18,434 --> 01:23:19,367
How's it going?

1345
01:23:22,767 --> 01:23:25,434
Yeah.
Uh-huh.

1346
01:23:25,501 --> 01:23:28,601
So, um, yeah.

1347
01:23:28,667 --> 01:23:30,267
Your mom been by?

1348
01:23:30,334 --> 01:23:32,934
Uh, she came by
a few days ago.

1349
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:33,934
Um...

1350
01:23:35,601 --> 01:23:37,534
She's not really
taking this too well.

1351
01:23:37,601 --> 01:23:39,267
Yeah?
Yeah.

1352
01:23:43,534 --> 01:23:47,000
How about, uh, Jeff?

1353
01:23:47,067 --> 01:23:49,634
Jeff was supposed
to come by yesterday,

1354
01:23:49,701 --> 01:23:53,501
and then something with his kid or something...

1355
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:06,033
Oh, oh! Hey, hey, hey.

1356
01:24:06,100 --> 01:24:07,501
Hey...

1357
01:24:07,567 --> 01:24:08,634
What?

1358
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:18,434
It's out?

1359
01:24:18,501 --> 01:24:21,067
Hot off the press,
from today's <i>Post.</i>

1360
01:24:21,133 --> 01:24:22,567
Oh, my God.

1361
01:24:28,734 --> 01:24:29,968
This is cake!

1362
01:24:30,033 --> 01:24:31,267
Uh, that's what I said.

1363
01:24:31,334 --> 01:24:33,033
Francisco...

1364
01:24:33,100 --> 01:24:34,601
Miami...

1365
01:24:37,067 --> 01:24:38,734
13 and 3. Easy.

1366
01:24:38,801 --> 01:24:39,968
What are your
three losses?

1367
01:24:40,033 --> 01:24:42,834
Green Bay, New England,
Chargers.

1368
01:24:42,901 --> 01:24:44,734
We could easily
beat Green Bay.

1369
01:24:44,801 --> 01:24:45,901
14 and 2.

1370
01:24:49,601 --> 01:24:50,734
Oh. Oh, man.

1371
01:24:50,801 --> 01:24:51,901
What?

1372
01:24:53,434 --> 01:24:56,033
New England, December 20th.

1373
01:24:58,934 --> 01:25:00,601
I get out that week.

1374
01:25:00,667 --> 01:25:01,667
Oh, shit.

1375
01:25:01,734 --> 01:25:02,667
Patsies are toast.

1376
01:25:02,734 --> 01:25:03,767
There's no way we're losing

1377
01:25:03,834 --> 01:25:05,601
with us in the parking lot.
Not a chance.

1378
01:25:05,667 --> 01:25:07,868
15 and 1.

1379
01:25:07,934 --> 01:25:09,067
Totally realistic.

1380
01:25:10,601 --> 01:25:12,000
Oh, man.

1381
01:25:13,767 --> 01:25:15,467
Oh, man!

1382
01:25:20,434 --> 01:25:21,901
It's gonna be a great year.

1383
01:27:49,934 --> 01:27:52,868
