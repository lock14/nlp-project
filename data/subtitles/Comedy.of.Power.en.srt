"This film does not claim
to depict real events.

3
00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:33,665
Any resemblance to persons,
living or dead,

4
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:36,235
is, as they say, coincidental."

5
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:38,960
Yes.

6
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:40,471
No.

7
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:43,035
Maybe. I don't know.

8
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:46,943
Get the papers to me
at the Hotel Meurice bar by noon.

9
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,311
Hang on.

10
00:00:49,816 --> 00:00:52,284
Hello, darling?

11
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:54,250
Goddammit!

12
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:59,725
Okay for the Meurice?

13
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:03,091
Fine. See you there.

14
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,726
<i>Le Figaro</i> wants an interview.

15
00:01:10,837 --> 00:01:13,237
They can attend
the press conference.

16
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:16,866
They all ask the same questions.
One answer will do.

17
00:01:16,976 --> 00:01:19,171
My mother!
The French Open.

18
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:22,908
Get her a seat.
She needs to get out more.

19
00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:26,579
Hello, darling?

20
00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:29,883
We were cut off.
I don't know why.

21
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:31,456
I'm listening.

22
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:32,855
How much?

23
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:36,027
We'll see.
Meet you at the airport.

24
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:37,994
See you on Monday, sir.

25
00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:41,291
Sir?

26
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:45,999
Evelyne, did you reserve
the kids' trip?

27
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:49,667
Yes, the apartment's all theirs.

28
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,835
What about the tickets?

29
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:54,309
Have them sent to their mother.

30
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:04,924
See you on Monday.
Try to get some rest.

31
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:09,090
Michelle, did you do as I asked?

32
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:12,961
Yes, sir.
You'll be in the royal suite.

33
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:17,059
It's been entirely renovated.
I saw the photos. It looks...

34
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:19,161
- Sensational.
- Good.

35
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:23,841
- How are the mattresses?
- I'll find out.

36
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:27,445
- I'll mention your allergies.
- Yes, thank you.

37
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,311
See you on Monday, sir.

38
00:02:54,774 --> 00:02:56,742
Police.
Come with us.

39
00:02:56,843 --> 00:03:00,210
What is this?
Jean-Noël, my briefcase.

40
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:02,672
What's going on?

41
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:04,507
You know who I am?

42
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:20,958
COMEDY OF POWER

43
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,843
What's going on?
I want to see my lawyer.

44
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:16,183
He's been notified.
Everything's legal. Go on.

45
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:23,522
My watch, too?

46
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,621
Good idea.

47
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:48,850
Undress, please.

48
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:51,719
Are you out of your mind?
You know who I am?

49
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:53,815
Your jacket, please.

50
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,801
Now your pants.

51
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:23,081
You must understand.

52
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:27,922
There must be advantages
on all sides, or some get resentful.

53
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:33,661
In the sixties,
champagne blowjobs were the thing.

54
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:36,428
Here's how it worked:

55
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:39,232
The person giving it made out well.

56
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:42,570
For the receiver, it changed nothing.

57
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,165
Excuse me, gentlemen.

58
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:48,941
Senator Descarts,
the phone call you were expecting.

59
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:50,640
Yes, indeed.

60
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:53,374
I'll only be a minute.

61
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:55,077
Be my guest.

62
00:05:55,254 --> 00:05:57,245
Don't you have a cell?

63
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:01,725
Only for outgoing calls.
I'm no greenhorn!

64
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:04,361
What do you think?

65
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:07,699
It will go fine, believe me.

66
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,361
I've known him for 30 years.
He has friends in high places.

67
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,027
Even now?

68
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:15,232
This mustn't hurt my country.

69
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:18,434
Don't worry.
If you play fair, so will he.

70
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:22,543
Pardon my ignorance,
but what's his constituency?

71
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:26,517
The North, despite his accent.

72
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:31,657
Here's a humdinger.

73
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:35,816
Our friend Humeau got caged
this morning.

74
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:37,919
- Isn't that a problem?
- Not at all.

75
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:40,464
That will keep them busy.

76
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,932
He'll be interrogated later.

77
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:45,930
He's in for it.
It's Charmant-Killman.

78
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,705
You know what they call her
at the courthouse?

79
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:50,969
The Piranha!

80
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:52,841
The Piranha.

81
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,290
- Is it all set?
- Hope so.

82
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:12,488
I'll know soon.
Do you have the diskette?

83
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:14,657
The diskette?

84
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,033
The CD Rom.

85
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,494
It's all there.

86
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:22,196
Sweep it under the rug if you like.

87
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:25,175
Not a chance. I hate rugs.

88
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:27,135
I thought so.

89
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,815
Thank you for trusting me.

90
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:34,383
It's mine.

91
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,611
Hello?

92
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:40,525
Indeed. Let's say around 3:00
this afternoon.

93
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:44,229
Then bring him in at 2:30.

94
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,457
But notify his lawyer.

95
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:49,597
Okay, but make sure anyway.

96
00:07:49,702 --> 00:07:51,533
Thanks, see you later.

97
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:57,339
I shouldn't tell you this,
but I'm seeing our friend.

98
00:07:58,377 --> 00:08:00,345
Then don't tell me.

99
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,143
Straight from a jail cell.

100
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:09,219
Maybe it will help his skin cells.

101
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:11,588
That wasn't nice.

102
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:13,019
Not very nice, no.

103
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:44,216
- Hello, Madame.
- Hello, Benoît.

104
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:50,261
- Your customer's here.
- Since when?

105
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:51,555
A good 15 minutes.

106
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:07,806
Bring him in.

107
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,987
You can remove the handcuffs.

108
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:41,042
Hello, Mr. Chairman.

109
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,238
Benoît, a seat.

110
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:50,654
Thanks.

111
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,957
No one taught you manners?

112
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:58,158
We're off to a good start.

113
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,162
Thank you.

114
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:02,462
We started ages ago,
Mr. Chairman.

115
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:06,004
May I introduce myself?
I'm Jeanne Charmant-Killman.

116
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:08,805
I'm the investigating judge.

117
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:13,503
Jeanne Charmant-Killman!
I pictured you taller.

118
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:21,375
Let's hope competence
isn't a matter of inches.

119
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:22,681
Where's my lawyer?

120
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:26,315
- What time is it? They took my watch.
- I have mine.

121
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:28,450
He must be stuck in traffic.

122
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:32,496
This is an outrage!
I was arrested and put in prison!

123
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:34,728
That wasn't my doing.

124
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:37,297
What do you want?

125
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,131
That I can tell you.

126
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:41,468
To charge you
with abuse of public funds,

127
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:44,236
abuse of trust, account-rigging...

128
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,810
The rest when your lawyer arrives.
How is that?

129
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:50,279
You're the group's CEO.
So you open the festivities.

130
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:53,318
Then I'll question no. 2,
no. 3 and so on.

131
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:54,816
What's wrong?

132
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,882
A skin disease.
I need medication.

133
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,286
Come in.

134
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,862
Hello, Mr. Parlebas.

135
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:09,767
Hello, Madame.
This is a bit last minute.

136
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:13,769
But you're here.
Please, have a seat.

137
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:17,504
I won't last without medication.

138
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:20,579
- My client needs his medication.
- I heard.

139
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:25,947
A prison doctor will examine him,
as is the rule.

140
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,282
I haven't read the file.

141
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:31,548
You're in luck.
You have all afternoon.

142
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:33,386
To read all this?

143
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:36,820
Your client's kept me very busy.

144
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:41,925
Well, I'm done for the day.

145
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,570
You'll have time to catch up.

146
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:54,172
Your glove.

147
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:56,745
I saw it, thanks.

148
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:01,845
- See you tomorrow, then.
- I'm spending the night in jail?

149
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:04,046
As I said, not my doing.

150
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:06,351
But it's an experience.

151
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:08,518
And you're in the VIP block.

152
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:13,357
- You don't miss a trick.
- She wants her name in the papers.

153
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:17,096
Try another tack.
Benoît, you'll handle it?

154
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:20,036
I will, Madame.
See you tomorrow.

155
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:24,469
What's this?

156
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:34,678
You're in good spirits.
What's up?

157
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:38,589
Humeau.
I think I've got him.

158
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:41,057
He thought he'd slip
through my fingers.

159
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:45,195
Jacques Sibaud's been a great help.
He doesn't beat around the bush.

160
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:49,759
I said you ran a medical lab.

161
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:52,602
What's it to him?

162
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:56,132
It just came out in the conversation.

163
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:00,372
And how was your day?

164
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:04,477
The usual crap.

165
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:08,451
Five HIV positives.
And three new cases of salmonella.

166
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:11,080
Isn't life wonderful?

167
00:13:11,757 --> 00:13:15,523
At least your work is useful.
What's the bag in the hall?

168
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:17,756
Your worthless nephew.

169
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:21,765
That worthless nephew
is your brother's son.

170
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:26,371
Since I stopped talking to my family,
what's mine is yours, my dear.

171
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:30,740
I took a shower.

172
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:33,240
You did well.

173
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:37,476
Did Uncle explain?
Can I crash here?

174
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:40,313
No, but crash as long as you like.

175
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:44,583
A little youth will do us good.
Right, darling?

176
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:47,724
Of course.

177
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,521
Like I said, make yourself at home.

178
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:53,392
Careful!

179
00:13:53,498 --> 00:13:57,730
You should find a job. How could you
quit civil service school?

180
00:13:57,836 --> 00:14:01,067
- It was the highway to success.
- I doze off on highways.

181
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,107
And I was fed up.

182
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:05,506
And exhausted
like you wouldn't believe.

183
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,445
A lack of ambition?

184
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:11,812
Sorry to change the subject,
but where do you stand?

185
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:14,442
- Where do I stand?
- What case are you on?

186
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:17,421
A whopper.
I'll tell you about it.

187
00:14:17,522 --> 00:14:19,717
- What did I do wrong?
- It's backwards.

188
00:14:19,825 --> 00:14:21,554
You're right.

189
00:14:28,533 --> 00:14:31,400
No time to shop.
I'll order pizza.

190
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:36,573
What would you do if you were rich?

191
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:39,607
The issue has never come up.

192
00:14:39,978 --> 00:14:44,005
I'm asking. Simulate expenditures
to define the buying impulse.

193
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:48,381
- That's all they do in school.
- They do that in school?

194
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:52,253
Jeanne Charmant-Killman.
The usual address.

195
00:14:52,357 --> 00:14:54,120
Three Margherita pizzas.

196
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:55,724
Four Seasons for me.

197
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:59,420
Sorry, one Four Seasons,
two Margheritas.

198
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:01,328
Nice and hot.

199
00:15:03,101 --> 00:15:05,092
Thanks.

200
00:15:13,345 --> 00:15:15,245
Up early? Any dates?

201
00:15:15,647 --> 00:15:17,376
At noon, with my ex.

202
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:21,210
Ex, already?
Not very serious.

203
00:15:21,386 --> 00:15:22,944
Nothing is serious.

204
00:15:23,288 --> 00:15:27,315
- What do you mean?
- Everything is tragic.

205
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:29,360
But I can still love life.

206
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:31,588
Can I have another pillow?

207
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,441
What are you doing?

208
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:58,687
Stop smoking and come to bed.

209
00:15:59,691 --> 00:16:00,521
Jeanne.

210
00:16:00,692 --> 00:16:01,818
Jeanne!

211
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:06,122
Take out your earplugs.

212
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,840
Humeau's mistress...
The clothes she wears!

213
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:22,506
I'll check the prices.
That will make his day!

214
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:30,885
No kiss?

215
00:16:34,993 --> 00:16:37,086
Tonight?

216
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:40,156
How about tomorrow?

217
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:43,533
We'll be less tired.

218
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:50,132
I love you, you know.

219
00:16:54,746 --> 00:16:56,304
Good night.

220
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:01,144
Good night. See you tomorrow.

221
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:26,035
I'm listening.

222
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:30,147
I'm not sure I've seen
all the documents.

223
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:33,809
I seem to know less than the press.

224
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,547
No smoking in my office.

225
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:42,924
Go on, counselor.

226
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:44,886
What are you after?

227
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:49,594
- The end of my client's career?
- I'm just doing my job.

228
00:17:49,768 --> 00:17:52,601
Sibaud replaces me,
badmouths me...

229
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:55,035
Change your tone of voice.

230
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:57,300
Two governments trusted me.

231
00:17:57,943 --> 00:18:01,435
- And you've abused that trust.
- In what way?

232
00:18:01,546 --> 00:18:03,878
You know as well as I do.

233
00:18:06,651 --> 00:18:08,551
The commissions.

234
00:18:09,154 --> 00:18:10,746
I can't check everything.

235
00:18:10,889 --> 00:18:12,049
But I can.

236
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:13,884
It's not that simple.

237
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,060
It's not that hard.

238
00:18:17,095 --> 00:18:20,258
In macroeconomics,
there are different sectors.

239
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:27,203
Is that so?

240
00:18:29,107 --> 00:18:31,075
Back to reality,
I'll tell you what I think.

241
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:34,168
I think you shamelessly
used your situation

242
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:37,874
for your personal enrichment,
to benefit your family and friends.

243
00:18:38,049 --> 00:18:41,109
Not true and grotesque.
It shows you don't know me.

244
00:18:41,219 --> 00:18:43,619
My family knows
the value of hard work!

245
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:45,451
I didn't go to a big school.

246
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:48,993
I rose through the ranks,
thinking only of my profession.

247
00:18:50,595 --> 00:18:54,224
At least,
you left patriotism out of it.

248
00:18:59,137 --> 00:19:01,002
That's you, isn't it?

249
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:07,334
- Who is she?
- My former assistant.

250
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:09,808
I'll be more precise.

251
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:13,874
She's your former mistress,
whom you made your assistant.

252
00:19:13,985 --> 00:19:16,476
That dress looks nice on her.

253
00:19:16,821 --> 00:19:19,688
- How much is she wearing?
- How much what?

254
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:23,294
The dress, the jewelry...
Do you know what it all costs?

255
00:19:23,895 --> 00:19:25,328
No. Why?

256
00:19:27,532 --> 00:19:29,523
You dress her from head to toe,

257
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:33,069
you wine and dine her,
and you don't know the cost?

258
00:19:33,171 --> 00:19:35,071
Good thing I'm here.

259
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:43,310
Here's a statement of all the bills
paid with the company credit card.

260
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:46,282
- This is absurd!
- You're telling me!

261
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:54,588
If I may, Madame.
Regarding the company credit card...

262
00:19:55,927 --> 00:20:00,364
You know as well as I do
that it's an old custom.

263
00:20:00,565 --> 00:20:03,796
The private sector has bonuses
and stock options.

264
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:06,097
The public sector compensates

265
00:20:06,204 --> 00:20:09,833
with the company card
for minor expenses.

266
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:24,384
- May I keep this?
- Sure, if you like.

267
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:27,957
May I have a glass of water?

268
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,593
Of course.

269
00:20:32,063 --> 00:20:35,191
But first answer my question,
Mr. Chairman.

270
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:39,802
How do you justify these expenses?

271
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:41,934
<i>Your group, as I recall,</i>

272
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:45,908
<i>was founded after the war to ensure</i>
<i>France's economic independence,</i>

273
00:20:46,244 --> 00:20:49,702
<i>the hub of this independence</i>
<i>being francophone markets.</i>

274
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:54,214
<i>Jacques Sibaud, does your recent</i>
<i>nomination imply a new direction?</i>

275
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:56,219
<i>Most likely a new identity.</i>

276
00:20:56,621 --> 00:20:59,818
<i>Governments come and go,</i>
<i>structures remain.</i>

277
00:21:00,158 --> 00:21:03,650
- Who is this jerk?
- Sibaud.

278
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,821
Not so "beau."

279
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:09,834
Could you hit the switch?

280
00:21:18,143 --> 00:21:20,737
- What are you doing?
- Changing bulbs.

281
00:21:20,845 --> 00:21:25,077
- The others were dead?
- I think they were about to blow.

282
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:30,988
- Your mom called with congrats.
- I know. She called me on my cell.

283
00:21:31,156 --> 00:21:32,783
And what do you think?

284
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:39,655
Do you know my new name
at the lab?

285
00:21:40,665 --> 00:21:41,757
No. What?

286
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,963
Can't you guess?

287
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:48,365
I answer riddles all day long.

288
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:50,200
I guessed.

289
00:21:52,177 --> 00:21:54,975
- Shoot.
- Mr. Jeanne Charmant-Killman?

290
00:21:55,146 --> 00:21:56,773
That's stupid.

291
00:21:57,048 --> 00:21:58,948
Totally stupid.

292
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:01,951
It's really... Stupid.

293
00:22:04,189 --> 00:22:06,953
What do you think?

294
00:22:07,058 --> 00:22:08,855
I think it's funny.

295
00:22:10,061 --> 00:22:11,961
Me, too.

296
00:22:21,706 --> 00:22:25,608
He's edgy. It happens
every time I'm on a big case.

297
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:28,736
Take a vacation,
go relax somewhere.

298
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:31,008
You think that's the answer!

299
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:33,550
A slacker's idea, right?

300
00:22:33,651 --> 00:22:35,915
I'll say no more.

301
00:22:38,289 --> 00:22:41,554
- Is this the family silver?
- A wedding gift from your grandma.

302
00:22:41,659 --> 00:22:45,095
Knives only.
No surprise. She hated me.

303
00:22:45,196 --> 00:22:48,654
- Do they cut well, at least?
- Not like they used to.

304
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:50,098
Sharpen them.

305
00:22:58,743 --> 00:23:02,372
Can you take off my glasses?
They're fogged up.

306
00:23:04,382 --> 00:23:07,351
You approve of these frauds
lining their pockets?

307
00:23:07,452 --> 00:23:10,615
It's only normal.
Fraud has to be profitable.

308
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:15,421
Humeau dipped in the till.
It's easy to produce the figures.

309
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:18,587
You could do better.
Where do the knives go?

310
00:23:18,696 --> 00:23:19,822
In the drawer.

311
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:22,229
Do better?

312
00:23:25,603 --> 00:23:27,798
Put the knives away right.

313
00:23:31,509 --> 00:23:36,537
That group has often been accused
of bankrolling friendly heads of state

314
00:23:36,648 --> 00:23:39,446
or opposition leaders,
sometimes both.

315
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:42,679
- That's the real scandal.
- First things first.

316
00:23:42,787 --> 00:23:45,779
I can't play the bull
in the china shop.

317
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:49,018
What's surprising
is that your pal Sibaud...

318
00:23:49,127 --> 00:23:51,789
Oh, please!

319
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,455
He went after his predecessor.

320
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:57,296
That's unusual
in such a big corporation.

321
00:23:57,402 --> 00:24:00,565
You're right.
So he winds up in court.

322
00:24:00,672 --> 00:24:03,573
They expect that to keep me busy.
Wrong.

323
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:05,709
When a door opens, I go in.

324
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:07,539
Who is "they"?

325
00:24:07,879 --> 00:24:10,177
I'll tell you when I find out.

326
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:12,912
First, I'll get Humeau to confess.

327
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:15,448
He can't handle prison.
If he wants out...

328
00:24:20,892 --> 00:24:21,984
Hello.

329
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:25,094
This is for you.

330
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:30,699
Have a nice day.

331
00:24:39,611 --> 00:24:41,511
It's time.

332
00:24:42,714 --> 00:24:44,045
Out you go.

333
00:24:44,449 --> 00:24:46,349
You have 10 minutes.

334
00:24:48,286 --> 00:24:49,776
So I'm free?

335
00:24:50,088 --> 00:24:52,215
I wouldn't know.

336
00:24:52,424 --> 00:24:53,356
10 minutes.

337
00:25:00,031 --> 00:25:03,330
Could you hand me
that pair of clean pants?

338
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:05,494
Get them yourself.

339
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:20,116
Why are you staring at me like that?

340
00:25:20,785 --> 00:25:22,582
You want tickets to Disneyland?

341
00:25:39,003 --> 00:25:39,901
Hello.

342
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:42,068
Are you busy, my dear?

343
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:44,533
No, no.

344
00:25:44,642 --> 00:25:46,803
I hear you're on the warpath.

345
00:25:46,911 --> 00:25:48,503
You could say that.

346
00:25:48,613 --> 00:25:52,447
I just wanted to wish you the best
on your saint day. Am I right?

347
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:55,519
That's sweet, Jacques.
No one else remembered.

348
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,087
Really?

349
00:25:57,188 --> 00:25:59,884
Are you free for lunch any time soon?

350
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:02,585
I've got amusing stories for you.

351
00:26:03,628 --> 00:26:05,823
You're putting me on the spot.

352
00:26:06,164 --> 00:26:08,564
I'd love to,
but it's not very orthodox.

353
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,828
Of course,
if you look at it that way...

354
00:26:11,936 --> 00:26:15,201
Let me finish with Humeau...

355
00:26:15,306 --> 00:26:17,570
Certainly. I'm unforgivable.

356
00:26:17,675 --> 00:26:21,133
And I know you're
a stickler for principles.

357
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:23,771
I just hope you wrap it up soon.

358
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:26,407
I'm doing my best.

359
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:32,583
I have to go.
My customer is here.

360
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:34,681
Thanks again.
See you soon.

361
00:26:34,793 --> 00:26:36,385
See you soon, Jeanne.

362
00:26:43,001 --> 00:26:45,333
Hello, Mr. Chairman.

363
00:26:46,037 --> 00:26:49,097
I brought you here
to check a few things.

364
00:26:50,175 --> 00:26:52,735
Are these plantings recent?

365
00:26:53,478 --> 00:26:55,173
Fairly recent.

366
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:59,774
53 orange trees and 29 lemon trees.
You do have the invoices, right?

367
00:26:59,884 --> 00:27:03,752
- That's why you brought me out?
- It wasn't to get some fresh air.

368
00:27:04,989 --> 00:27:09,358
- Take these handcuffs off, please.
- Not until I check a few things.

369
00:27:27,011 --> 00:27:28,842
Nicole Humeau?

370
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:31,276
Why? What time is it?

371
00:27:31,616 --> 00:27:33,584
Justice Charmant-Killman.

372
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:36,848
It's 9:30 a.m.,
and I have a search warrant.

373
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:38,478
Don't worry, darling.

374
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:40,685
Are the kids home?

375
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:43,158
They're asleep.
They got in late.

376
00:27:43,528 --> 00:27:45,723
We won't search their rooms.

377
00:28:01,312 --> 00:28:05,305
I don't see your suits or shoes.
Don't you live at home?

378
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,853
Sorry if your husband
leads a double life.

379
00:28:12,323 --> 00:28:14,757
- This is vile.
- You don't say.

380
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:16,583
You're vile.

381
00:28:16,694 --> 00:28:20,061
My husband lives here.
He always dresses casually.

382
00:28:27,939 --> 00:28:31,932
In photos, he always wears a suit.
Never the same one.

383
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:36,143
Not to mention the shirts,
ties, cufflinks.

384
00:28:40,251 --> 00:28:43,049
A vast choice for telling time.

385
00:28:43,821 --> 00:28:47,018
An Omega, two Cartier...
A must!

386
00:28:47,191 --> 00:28:49,091
Company gifts.

387
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,319
You don't say.

388
00:28:53,264 --> 00:28:55,858
My husband did nothing wrong.

389
00:28:56,601 --> 00:29:01,402
His colleagues, other CEOs,
influential politicians,

390
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:03,440
all expressed their support.

391
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:07,101
He has an admirable wife,
in any case.

392
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:09,470
Back to the courthouse.

393
00:29:10,214 --> 00:29:12,774
So, no tree nursery invoice.

394
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:16,217
Now, this flat where
you set up your mistress,

395
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:19,882
5830 sq. ft.
in the most expensive part of town.

396
00:29:19,991 --> 00:29:21,891
Do I give you the price?

397
00:29:21,993 --> 00:29:25,690
I didn't buy the flat.
You can't prove it. You're bluffing.

398
00:29:25,797 --> 00:29:28,789
I'm bluffing and you're lily white.

399
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,869
- Next question.
- I won't answer.

400
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:34,165
I'll wait for my lawyer.

401
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:35,967
He's on his way. Sit down.

402
00:29:36,074 --> 00:29:39,009
I can't sit still!
I'm ill, you know!

403
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,805
The ball's in your court.

404
00:29:40,912 --> 00:29:43,904
Some people have done
much worse than I have.

405
00:29:44,015 --> 00:29:46,313
- Those who back you?
- I never said that!

406
00:29:51,656 --> 00:29:54,022
Why are you hounding me?

407
00:29:57,028 --> 00:30:01,226
To set an example, once and for all.

408
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:04,533
You won't come out too badly.

409
00:30:04,702 --> 00:30:06,932
And it will do the nation good.

410
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:09,904
You know what I think?

411
00:30:10,341 --> 00:30:11,865
Tell me.

412
00:31:33,825 --> 00:31:36,225
There's hot coffee in the kitchen.

413
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:47,436
This year we'll rent
a house on the beach.

414
00:31:48,673 --> 00:31:50,971
We'll be happy.

415
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:53,637
We'll be...

416
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:56,940
What did you use to say?

417
00:31:58,149 --> 00:32:02,051
- Visible for each other.
- That's right.

418
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:06,349
Visible for each other.
Is Felix home?

419
00:32:06,524 --> 00:32:08,617
He just got in.

420
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:10,985
He spent the night out.

421
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:12,528
Really?

422
00:32:13,731 --> 00:32:16,359
Look what I found in a drawer.

423
00:32:16,834 --> 00:32:20,429
This really takes us back.

424
00:32:20,938 --> 00:32:25,068
Remember?
I made this in a jiffy out of nothing.

425
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:30,974
You could always make things
in a jiffy out of nothing.

426
00:32:31,382 --> 00:32:33,509
You don't lack talent.

427
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:35,819
What do I lack?

428
00:32:37,321 --> 00:32:39,653
I'll tell you some day.

429
00:32:41,659 --> 00:32:42,785
See you tonight.

430
00:32:42,894 --> 00:32:44,725
See you tonight.

431
00:32:53,404 --> 00:32:56,567
<i>I don't intend to smear their leaders.</i>

432
00:32:56,674 --> 00:33:00,474
<i>Still, the interrogations</i>
<i>and indictments keep coming.</i>

433
00:33:00,578 --> 00:33:02,307
<i>Michel Humeau's in a bad way.</i>

434
00:33:02,413 --> 00:33:05,849
<i>I don't intend to intimidate</i>
<i>or destabilize anyone...</i>

435
00:33:07,785 --> 00:33:09,753
I hear you there, see you here!

436
00:33:09,854 --> 00:33:12,414
Turn it off. I can't stand it.

437
00:33:13,591 --> 00:33:15,286
So, you spent the night out?

438
00:33:15,693 --> 00:33:17,991
To my great benefit.

439
00:33:19,564 --> 00:33:20,656
What's that?

440
00:33:20,865 --> 00:33:23,561
Poker.
I cleaned a few people out.

441
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:26,637
It won't hurt them, as my aunt says.

442
00:33:26,804 --> 00:33:29,967
You intend to earn a living
playing poker?

443
00:33:30,241 --> 00:33:32,232
Get angry. I love it.

444
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:35,540
How about lunch,
a place with good wine?

445
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:38,541
Quick, then.
I'm seeing bigwigs at 2:00.

446
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,917
What are they doing?

447
00:33:45,122 --> 00:33:46,953
Playing soccer.

448
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:49,853
Only 12?
They don't have enough players.

449
00:33:49,961 --> 00:33:51,952
I'd better fix that.

450
00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:55,226
I'll show you his cell.

451
00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:00,166
- Isn't that what you wanted?
- Absolutely.

452
00:34:02,573 --> 00:34:07,567
When you're used to 5 stars,
it's a little barren.

453
00:34:07,678 --> 00:34:09,737
That's an understatement.

454
00:34:10,514 --> 00:34:14,416
Who is in charge of keeping
the place clean, warden?

455
00:34:14,518 --> 00:34:18,818
We had it repainted not long ago,
but we're short on funds.

456
00:34:18,923 --> 00:34:20,584
Ah, funding problems!

457
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:26,990
Beware of lawyers.

458
00:34:27,098 --> 00:34:30,067
They tend to slip in treats
during their visits.

459
00:34:30,167 --> 00:34:32,465
Do a search after each visit.

460
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:36,097
That's just what we try to do,
Madame.

461
00:34:36,307 --> 00:34:38,537
The other cells are identical.

462
00:34:38,643 --> 00:34:40,167
That's worrying!

463
00:34:51,188 --> 00:34:52,416
So, who won?

464
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,285
No one. We play for fun.

465
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:56,086
Then enjoy!

466
00:34:56,994 --> 00:35:01,693
I don't have a Swiss bank account.
I have no foreign accounts.

467
00:35:04,502 --> 00:35:08,199
- You're not taking it down?
- Your lawyer's not here.

468
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:12,698
- Why isn't he here?
- Ask him when he arrives.

469
00:35:13,678 --> 00:35:16,078
That doesn't mean we can't chat.

470
00:35:17,048 --> 00:35:21,917
How about those huge commissions
you've always paid left and right?

471
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:26,884
The Herod file.

472
00:35:29,026 --> 00:35:30,152
Is the sum right?

473
00:35:31,829 --> 00:35:34,957
Could be. It's common currency
in our business.

474
00:35:35,733 --> 00:35:37,894
Common currency.

475
00:35:38,002 --> 00:35:42,302
A charming term,
but not for the Revenue Court.

476
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:46,940
It seems you shamelessly
squandered state funds.

477
00:35:47,445 --> 00:35:51,882
How can you say that?
I brought in huge sums.

478
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:55,951
The payments I made
enriched the group and the nation.

479
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:59,351
And yourself as well.
Using front men.

480
00:36:02,626 --> 00:36:04,321
All because of a woman.

481
00:36:07,965 --> 00:36:09,125
But you loved her?

482
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,825
We broke up, you know that.

483
00:36:12,036 --> 00:36:14,436
You'd be the only one not to know.

484
00:36:15,373 --> 00:36:17,034
She's an ocean away.

485
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:21,467
An ocean away,
in a sumptuous flat you bought her,

486
00:36:21,612 --> 00:36:24,274
overlooking Central Park.

487
00:36:24,415 --> 00:36:26,315
She wrote you a letter. Shall I?

488
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:28,385
Please, don't.

489
00:36:29,954 --> 00:36:31,615
She's thirsty for blood.

490
00:36:31,722 --> 00:36:33,986
She's a compulsive liar,
and she's jealous, you see?

491
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:35,484
See what?

492
00:36:37,628 --> 00:36:40,028
I was crazy about her.
I gave her everything.

493
00:36:40,197 --> 00:36:42,529
Then virtually overnight...

494
00:36:49,673 --> 00:36:50,901
What happened?

495
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:54,637
I don't know.

496
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:56,808
My desire for her died.

497
00:36:58,349 --> 00:37:00,647
You got hot for something else?

498
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,020
Here's what she cost you:

499
00:37:08,926 --> 00:37:11,622
Swimming pool vacuum,
latest model.

500
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:13,560
4,000 euros.

501
00:37:14,198 --> 00:37:16,723
Swimming pool, 50,000 euros.

502
00:37:16,834 --> 00:37:20,964
Not including the pool-house and spa,
which she had moved.

503
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,903
Two spas, two drillings.

504
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,401
But I don't mean to scare you.

505
00:37:25,509 --> 00:37:27,374
All from the group's coffers.

506
00:37:28,312 --> 00:37:31,839
You know how many people earn
minimum wage in France?

507
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:36,881
You know this man?

508
00:37:37,822 --> 00:37:38,686
René Lange?

509
00:37:39,123 --> 00:37:40,454
Are you on good terms?

510
00:37:41,158 --> 00:37:45,390
He's a politician.
Politics isn't business.

511
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:47,360
Some people think so.

512
00:37:47,798 --> 00:37:49,356
Got a bone to pick?

513
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:52,133
Absolutely not.
He does as he wishes.

514
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:55,166
He dumped me, like the others did.

515
00:37:55,272 --> 00:37:59,538
- What others?
- Those I did favors for.

516
00:37:59,844 --> 00:38:04,838
Delombre, Holeo, Boldi.

517
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:09,648
They answered to you?
They dumped you, too?

518
00:38:11,322 --> 00:38:13,449
They all dumped me.

519
00:38:16,327 --> 00:38:17,885
Isn't that how it goes?

520
00:38:19,296 --> 00:38:21,127
It's that prison...

521
00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:24,830
You should hear the screams
at night.

522
00:38:24,935 --> 00:38:26,994
The new guys, the young ones...

523
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:29,462
As soon as they get there...

524
00:38:29,573 --> 00:38:31,541
They're in for it.

525
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:34,635
Not in the VIP block, I hope.

526
00:38:38,215 --> 00:38:40,080
I've had it.

527
00:38:41,318 --> 00:38:42,910
I can't take anymore.

528
00:38:43,587 --> 00:38:45,452
I can't take anymore.

529
00:38:56,133 --> 00:38:58,226
I'm exhausted!

530
00:38:58,969 --> 00:39:01,335
I need treatment!

531
00:39:02,306 --> 00:39:07,573
I do what I can, try to keep busy,
but I can't take anymore.

532
00:39:08,746 --> 00:39:11,044
Please, I'm begging you.

533
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:14,148
I'm begging you.

534
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:41,710
Okay, permission
for outside hospitalization.

535
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:18,113
Don't worry about it.
I still have work to do.

536
00:40:19,084 --> 00:40:21,814
- I'll do room 220, then.
- Okay.

537
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,945
I won't be long.

538
00:40:45,677 --> 00:40:47,167
Good night, Madame.

539
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:50,406
- You can do my office now.
- Thank you.

540
00:41:56,381 --> 00:41:57,712
Hello?

541
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:00,679
Christ almighty!

542
00:42:02,053 --> 00:42:03,384
What?

543
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:07,256
Was it an accident?

544
00:42:07,926 --> 00:42:09,484
Christ almighty!

545
00:43:09,187 --> 00:43:13,146
What is this?
What moron thought that one up?

546
00:43:13,258 --> 00:43:17,126
It could be just an accident.

547
00:43:24,469 --> 00:43:27,961
Looks more like a fuckup
than an accident.

548
00:43:28,072 --> 00:43:31,940
What a bunch of clowns
we're surrounded with!

549
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:34,101
Is she badly hurt?

550
00:43:34,212 --> 00:43:36,680
According to my sources, no.

551
00:43:36,781 --> 00:43:37,907
Pathetic.

552
00:43:38,016 --> 00:43:39,711
Pathetic!

553
00:43:39,817 --> 00:43:43,685
Let's go. She's starting again.

554
00:44:04,876 --> 00:44:07,276
They said you were unconscious,

555
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:10,808
they'd sedated you,
but that it's not serious.

556
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:14,448
I know all that.

557
00:44:15,453 --> 00:44:19,549
You never know when to quit.
You work like a lunatic.

558
00:44:20,792 --> 00:44:23,260
You fell asleep at the wheel.
Imagine!

559
00:44:23,361 --> 00:44:25,591
I imagine very well.

560
00:44:25,897 --> 00:44:29,264
I think they rigged
my brakes and steering.

561
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:32,497
Don't be silly.
You were just tired.

562
00:44:35,406 --> 00:44:37,397
Get me some hot chocolate.

563
00:44:37,942 --> 00:44:40,308
I'm craving hot chocolate.

564
00:44:41,279 --> 00:44:46,546
I can worry, can't I?
We have the right to live normally.

565
00:44:47,819 --> 00:44:54,657
You're out of luck with me, honey.
I'll never give up.

566
00:44:55,593 --> 00:44:58,721
They won't get away with this,
believe me.

567
00:44:59,664 --> 00:45:02,997
- You're crazy.
- Maybe, but I'll go all the way.

568
00:45:05,036 --> 00:45:06,936
I'll let you rest.

569
00:45:07,405 --> 00:45:09,236
I'll be back later.

570
00:45:10,742 --> 00:45:11,936
Ah, Felix!

571
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:17,002
- You're sweet to visit.
- I love hospitals.

572
00:45:17,382 --> 00:45:19,748
- Your hot chocolate?
- Black, no sugar.

573
00:45:21,185 --> 00:45:25,246
What a gorgeous bouquet!
We'll ask for a vase.

574
00:45:26,324 --> 00:45:28,918
I'll get one.
Black, no sugar.

575
00:45:29,327 --> 00:45:30,453
Thanks, sweetie.

576
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:47,205
Who are the guys outside?

577
00:45:47,612 --> 00:45:49,842
My bodyguards.

578
00:45:50,415 --> 00:45:52,042
So you won't worry.

579
00:45:56,287 --> 00:45:59,017
- You're hard on him.
- Me, hard?

580
00:45:59,123 --> 00:46:01,648
I don't think so.

581
00:46:01,893 --> 00:46:05,829
I was thinking earlier...
Do you have a picture of your son?

582
00:46:06,531 --> 00:46:08,692
I've never even seen him.

583
00:46:13,971 --> 00:46:15,598
He's awfully cute!

584
00:46:16,007 --> 00:46:19,204
- How old is he?
- Three.

585
00:46:19,310 --> 00:46:23,576
- Why don't you bring him over?
- He's always with his saintly mother.

586
00:46:23,681 --> 00:46:26,081
- Yes, and so?
- I'm not wild about saints.

587
00:46:26,184 --> 00:46:27,811
Me neither.

588
00:46:28,019 --> 00:46:30,886
I'm in good company these days!

589
00:46:31,122 --> 00:46:34,182
Could you get me the papers
over there?

590
00:46:36,727 --> 00:46:39,525
- Do you want your glasses?
- Yes, please.

591
00:46:40,364 --> 00:46:42,025
Thanks.

592
00:46:52,109 --> 00:46:54,577
Boy, he doesn't waste any time.

593
00:46:56,447 --> 00:46:58,608
I get it now! It was him.

594
00:46:58,716 --> 00:47:00,707
- Who?
- Humeau.

595
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:05,016
I let him out for first-class care,
and he has my car rigged.

596
00:47:05,122 --> 00:47:06,680
And I wind up in the hospital, too.

597
00:47:07,458 --> 00:47:08,857
Why him?

598
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:12,020
He was weird the last time.
He didn't scratch.

599
00:47:12,163 --> 00:47:15,223
He gave me shifty looks.
He was plotting it.

600
00:47:16,901 --> 00:47:20,564
- You're paranoid.
- Maybe, but I don't think so.

601
00:47:20,771 --> 00:47:24,172
- Humeau's an underling.
- That would surprise me.

602
00:47:24,275 --> 00:47:28,268
It surprised him to be the tree
that hides the forest.

603
00:47:28,379 --> 00:47:31,405
- What forest?
- The one growing silently.

604
00:47:31,516 --> 00:47:36,010
I've had a feeling all along.
I hate to say it, but I know them.

605
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:38,213
The big scams are elsewhere.

606
00:47:39,156 --> 00:47:40,646
I'll haul them all in.

607
00:47:40,758 --> 00:47:43,192
Right-hand men,
coworkers, advisors.

608
00:47:43,294 --> 00:47:45,956
They haven't seen the last of me.

609
00:47:47,131 --> 00:47:48,689
But...

610
00:47:49,166 --> 00:47:56,095
Why do you think they
gave me those bodyguards?

611
00:47:56,574 --> 00:48:01,102
Well chosen, aren't they?
Strong, impressive.

612
00:48:01,212 --> 00:48:04,613
- They're looking after you.
- To throw me off track?

613
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:10,085
If they're smart, and some are,
they'll take extra-good care of you.

614
00:48:10,955 --> 00:48:14,152
I'll take advantage of it, believe me.

615
00:48:15,059 --> 00:48:16,458
Come in.

616
00:48:19,363 --> 00:48:21,558
Aren't you spoiled!

617
00:48:21,666 --> 00:48:24,692
- Who brought that?
- Some florist.

618
00:48:24,802 --> 00:48:27,737
I've been outdone.
Shall I open the card?

619
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:29,533
Sure.

620
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:34,901
Jacques Sibaud. There's a note.

621
00:48:35,012 --> 00:48:38,709
- I told you he was a part of it.
- Of course! You think I'm stupid?

622
00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:41,944
Did you send those flowers
to charming Mrs. Charmant?

623
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,551
You're sure she got them?

624
00:48:45,222 --> 00:48:49,090
Always send flowers
to the unfortunate.

625
00:48:51,596 --> 00:48:54,463
You plan to let her go on with this?

626
00:48:56,500 --> 00:49:01,233
I think we should use
the promotion ploy on her.

627
00:49:01,639 --> 00:49:04,233
There's no promotion possible.

628
00:49:04,709 --> 00:49:09,578
I didn't say, "Give her a promotion,"
but "Use the promotion ploy."

629
00:49:10,581 --> 00:49:12,446
Come to think of it...

630
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:23,988
They're supposed to move from
the courthouse to a new building.

631
00:49:25,162 --> 00:49:26,857
Perfect!

632
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:28,329
Is it spacious?

633
00:49:28,733 --> 00:49:30,963
There's lots of room.

634
00:49:31,068 --> 00:49:32,865
She'll have a large office.

635
00:49:33,904 --> 00:49:36,270
That's always appreciated.

636
00:49:36,474 --> 00:49:38,965
She also asked for an assistant.

637
00:49:40,311 --> 00:49:41,869
Good idea.

638
00:49:42,013 --> 00:49:47,212
After this incident, and with all
those cases she has to deal with...

639
00:49:48,219 --> 00:49:51,450
But we mustn't end up
with two snoops instead of one.

640
00:49:51,622 --> 00:49:54,853
Got any women in stock?

641
00:49:57,895 --> 00:49:58,884
Why a woman?

642
00:50:00,231 --> 00:50:03,462
Because women love to do
dirty tricks to other women.

643
00:50:08,873 --> 00:50:12,036
"Justice Charmant promoted..."

644
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:15,544
How big is the new office?

645
00:50:15,646 --> 00:50:17,978
It's a surprise.

646
00:50:19,216 --> 00:50:21,946
- Can we help?
- You must be joking.

647
00:50:22,887 --> 00:50:26,345
We worked well here,
didn't we, Benoît?

648
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:32,588
This is from everybody here.

649
00:50:32,697 --> 00:50:34,597
How sweet.

650
00:50:35,332 --> 00:50:39,996
It was a toss-up with "Aubade"
but we chose "In Love Again."

651
00:50:44,341 --> 00:50:47,674
Smells nice.
You made the right choice.

652
00:50:47,778 --> 00:50:48,767
Thank you.

653
00:50:52,917 --> 00:50:56,409
They're all expecting you.
What flight are you taking?

654
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:58,249
None.

655
00:50:58,389 --> 00:51:01,517
I'll send it all by email.
Holeo will stand in as usual.

656
00:51:01,625 --> 00:51:04,856
That's his job,
and he loves hot weather.

657
00:51:05,262 --> 00:51:07,196
Very well, Mr. Chairman.

658
00:51:09,366 --> 00:51:11,231
Yes, Mr. President.

659
00:51:11,402 --> 00:51:14,929
Experts are already
assessing the project.

660
00:51:15,773 --> 00:51:18,901
It's too early to say.
These are high-risk countries.

661
00:51:20,111 --> 00:51:22,807
Naturally, I'll gladly make the trip.

662
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:26,178
I just cancelled my flight
on Holeo's insistence.

663
00:51:26,283 --> 00:51:28,513
I'm on top of it all.

664
00:51:28,619 --> 00:51:29,984
Thank you.

665
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:31,987
Good-bye, Mr. President.

666
00:51:45,703 --> 00:51:46,567
Jeanne.

667
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:55,841
I've been thinking of you too,
Jacques. Quite often.

668
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:59,438
You once said
the only goal in life is excellence.

669
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:02,144
I'm trying to be a worthy disciple.

670
00:52:07,191 --> 00:52:08,658
Yes.

671
00:52:14,298 --> 00:52:18,598
The Presiding Judge is here

672
00:52:19,770 --> 00:52:21,567
But...

673
00:52:22,006 --> 00:52:25,840
I'm very busy these days,
and I need to get my bearings.

674
00:52:26,377 --> 00:52:29,403
I'm sure you're running
the show just fine,

675
00:52:29,513 --> 00:52:31,640
but I miss our lunches.

676
00:52:31,749 --> 00:52:36,209
So when you have a minute, call.
It won't take all night.

677
00:52:37,188 --> 00:52:39,588
I'll leave you
to your territorial stake-out.

678
00:52:39,690 --> 00:52:41,920
One more thing.

679
00:52:42,026 --> 00:52:44,392
That black suit looks great on you.

680
00:52:48,666 --> 00:52:50,293
Jeanne!

681
00:52:53,838 --> 00:52:56,170
I'm so glad to see you.

682
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,767
Thanks for putting me here.
It's sumptuous.

683
00:52:58,876 --> 00:53:01,174
- Big enough?
- Almost too big.

684
00:53:01,278 --> 00:53:03,712
And the design is superb.

685
00:53:04,048 --> 00:53:07,677
- So are you. You look great.
- I feel great.

686
00:53:14,491 --> 00:53:18,257
- Hello, Mr. President.
- Hello... Benoît, right?

687
00:53:18,362 --> 00:53:20,592
- As loyal as ever?
- Yes, sir.

688
00:53:20,698 --> 00:53:24,156
- Glad you like it.
- You know me. It's all ready to go.

689
00:53:24,268 --> 00:53:28,432
- Can you find your way in this maze?
- With my eyes closed.

690
00:53:29,907 --> 00:53:33,775
- I want a word with you outside.
- Certainly.

691
00:53:37,581 --> 00:53:41,847
You'll be glad to hear
you're no longer working alone.

692
00:53:41,952 --> 00:53:44,045
I've assigned you someone.

693
00:53:44,488 --> 00:53:49,152
She has plenty of experience,
especially with politicians.

694
00:53:49,393 --> 00:53:51,258
"She"? Who is she?

695
00:53:51,362 --> 00:53:52,920
I'll introduce you.

696
00:54:00,871 --> 00:54:04,329
What do I care about this trivia?

697
00:54:04,441 --> 00:54:07,740
Question me about
my international role.

698
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:10,478
About how you fleece
friendly nations?

699
00:54:10,581 --> 00:54:11,775
Or fund parties?

700
00:54:12,149 --> 00:54:15,141
You're obsessed.
Let me tell you...

701
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:17,083
Excuse me a minute.

702
00:54:25,162 --> 00:54:29,394
Erika Eymard. Jeanne Charmant.
My two favorite judges.

703
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:30,990
We're on the same floor.

704
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:33,592
- How long have you been here?
- She just arrived.

705
00:54:33,704 --> 00:54:36,832
Adjoining offices will make
communication easy.

706
00:54:36,941 --> 00:54:39,535
René Lange is mine.
I'll continue what I started.

707
00:54:39,643 --> 00:54:43,044
We can share him.
You want to sink him, so do I.

708
00:54:43,147 --> 00:54:45,411
Sink those who think they can swim.

709
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:50,143
- Great. I'm going back in.
- Work hard. I'll see you later.

710
00:54:50,254 --> 00:54:52,415
I work alone.
Why didn't you warn me?

711
00:54:52,523 --> 00:54:54,753
I need you both.

712
00:54:54,858 --> 00:54:58,760
You'll suit one another.
It's good for the image of justice.

713
00:54:58,862 --> 00:55:02,764
It's not the image of justice
I care about. It's justice.

714
00:55:11,508 --> 00:55:13,772
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Madame.

715
00:55:14,645 --> 00:55:16,704
Madame Killman!

716
00:55:20,451 --> 00:55:23,648
- Ground floor or parking lot?
- Ground floor.

717
00:55:26,623 --> 00:55:29,353
By the way,
I didn't ask to work with you.

718
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:30,859
I figured as much.

719
00:55:30,961 --> 00:55:35,489
But I agree with you, it's not clear.
Someone thinks we'll hurt each other.

720
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:37,066
That's what I think.

721
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:40,625
We'll prove them wrong,
that we're equal to them.

722
00:55:40,738 --> 00:55:43,172
We'll get those machos by the balls.

723
00:55:43,273 --> 00:55:44,831
See you tomorrow.

724
00:55:50,948 --> 00:55:53,314
"We'll get those machos
by the balls!"

725
00:55:53,417 --> 00:55:54,645
"See you tomorrow."

726
00:55:58,389 --> 00:56:01,984
- Alone today?
- My colleague's at your place.

727
00:56:02,092 --> 00:56:04,356
- May I?
- Thanks.

728
00:56:11,335 --> 00:56:14,304
Don't mind me.
Everything's fine.

729
00:56:14,505 --> 00:56:17,167
- I'll be back in two hours.
- Fine.

730
00:56:17,274 --> 00:56:18,434
I owe you one.

731
00:56:19,610 --> 00:56:23,102
What are you doing here?
Philippe isn't home yet?

732
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:25,078
Not yet.

733
00:56:25,182 --> 00:56:29,243
I've had your keys for three weeks.
They're on the kitchen table.

734
00:56:29,353 --> 00:56:31,321
I'm exhausted!

735
00:56:31,422 --> 00:56:33,356
We moved today.

736
00:56:33,457 --> 00:56:35,186
They stuck you in a closet?

737
00:56:35,292 --> 00:56:39,524
Not at all.
A sumptuous new office.

738
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:40,927
It's very nice.

739
00:56:41,031 --> 00:56:43,966
Like everyone,
I read about your promotion.

740
00:56:44,134 --> 00:56:45,829
It worried me.

741
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:47,396
Me, too.

742
00:56:47,504 --> 00:56:50,439
It smells fishy, but I'll show them.

743
00:56:50,908 --> 00:56:52,808
Do you like your apartment?

744
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:55,276
Great! I call it "Flat Out".

745
00:56:57,414 --> 00:56:59,279
I need some tea, or I'll collapse.

746
00:57:04,121 --> 00:57:07,090
- Want some tea?
- No, thanks.

747
00:57:07,391 --> 00:57:08,449
Tea!

748
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:17,122
- They're nice, but there's no privacy.
- I have nothing to hide.

749
00:57:17,234 --> 00:57:19,668
What's this about crosswords?

750
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:23,137
Tea's a good idea after all.
Want some?

751
00:57:24,575 --> 00:57:26,873
I devise crosswords. It's fun.

752
00:57:26,977 --> 00:57:28,672
I've being cranking them out
for ages.

753
00:57:28,779 --> 00:57:33,773
I have a daily, 2 weeklies,
and 3 pseudonyms.

754
00:57:33,884 --> 00:57:37,115
And, of course, three casts of mind.

755
00:57:37,221 --> 00:57:39,416
I work when I want,
and I'm having fun.

756
00:57:39,523 --> 00:57:41,718
- Make any money?
- Enough.

757
00:57:41,825 --> 00:57:44,760
- Any time for your son?
- Sure.

758
00:57:44,862 --> 00:57:47,353
Is your case going that badly?

759
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:50,831
No, but the situation is annoying.

760
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:55,902
They stuck me with an associate.

761
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:58,137
Do you know who did it?

762
00:57:58,242 --> 00:58:00,904
Officially, Martino,
the Presiding Judge.

763
00:58:01,011 --> 00:58:02,478
I've known him for years.

764
00:58:02,579 --> 00:58:05,707
A nice guy.
I doubt it was his idea.

765
00:58:07,084 --> 00:58:10,349
If only I could flush them
out of their holes!

766
00:58:10,454 --> 00:58:12,649
The creeps!

767
00:58:12,756 --> 00:58:16,658
With a little luck and lots of grit...

768
00:58:17,394 --> 00:58:20,886
- What's your colleague like?
- Hard to tell.

769
00:58:20,998 --> 00:58:26,265
She's nice enough,
young, competent.

770
00:58:26,370 --> 00:58:28,565
She has a good reputation.

771
00:58:28,672 --> 00:58:30,367
Pretty?

772
00:58:30,474 --> 00:58:34,205
I suppose. Depends what you like.
You want me to introduce you?

773
00:58:34,311 --> 00:58:37,940
If it will help, I'm all yours.

774
00:58:39,183 --> 00:58:43,142
I'm going to betray
a judicial secret.

775
00:58:43,253 --> 00:58:46,222
Tomorrow I have to play
my cards right.

776
00:58:46,323 --> 00:58:52,125
I'm questioning Holeo.
You know who he is?

777
00:58:52,229 --> 00:58:53,662
He's a head honcho.

778
00:58:53,764 --> 00:58:57,666
Friends with everyone.
Old playboy type. Got any cookies?

779
00:58:57,834 --> 00:59:00,029
As you must know, Madame,

780
00:59:00,137 --> 00:59:03,538
our group makes
all sorts of investments.

781
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:06,507
Major companies use our services.

782
00:59:06,610 --> 00:59:10,046
There are three
or four hundred of them.

783
00:59:10,881 --> 00:59:12,849
You misunderstand, Mr. Holeo.

784
00:59:12,950 --> 00:59:15,441
I mean your special relations
in countries

785
00:59:15,586 --> 00:59:17,884
where the group has interests.

786
00:59:18,355 --> 00:59:24,419
I fail to see the connection
with your investigation.

787
00:59:26,163 --> 00:59:32,727
I just want to make sure you're not
behind the disappearance

788
00:59:32,836 --> 00:59:34,133
of large sums of money.

789
00:59:34,438 --> 00:59:36,235
That again!

790
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:41,040
Mr. Humeau, the former CEO,
had several audits done.

791
00:59:41,311 --> 00:59:42,710
He found nothing wrong.

792
00:59:42,813 --> 00:59:46,442
He chose to ignore it.
You know where he is now.

793
00:59:50,821 --> 00:59:52,288
But...

794
00:59:53,156 --> 00:59:57,923
There are several foreign accounts
in your name, Mr. Holeo.

795
00:59:58,095 --> 01:00:00,393
Perhaps, but they're not mine.

796
01:00:01,064 --> 01:00:05,057
I simply manage them.
I'm a middleman.

797
01:00:05,168 --> 01:00:06,294
For whom?

798
01:00:09,006 --> 01:00:10,439
No one in particular.

799
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:15,307
Certain sums transit
through those accounts.

800
01:00:15,479 --> 01:00:16,571
To whom?

801
01:00:18,148 --> 01:00:19,410
That depends.

802
01:00:19,516 --> 01:00:22,314
There are all types of subsidies.

803
01:00:22,586 --> 01:00:27,046
I know that, and oddly enough,
some subsidies look like kickbacks.

804
01:00:27,157 --> 01:00:30,251
You overvalue an operation,
then help yourself.

805
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:32,954
So I'm asking you,
who is the money for?

806
01:00:34,331 --> 01:00:42,534
- What money?
- You don't remember?

807
01:00:43,573 --> 01:00:46,133
I must admit, I don't.

808
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:48,838
Do you remember him?

809
01:00:48,945 --> 01:00:50,412
Delombre? Sure.

810
01:00:50,514 --> 01:00:54,280
He smokes cigars in the morning.
It's very unpleasant.

811
01:00:55,085 --> 01:00:56,609
How well do you know him?

812
01:00:58,121 --> 01:01:00,521
I know he works hard.

813
01:01:00,624 --> 01:01:03,559
But our activities
are completely unconnected.

814
01:01:05,295 --> 01:01:08,526
Things are very compartmentalized
with you, Mr. Holeo.

815
01:01:08,632 --> 01:01:10,395
Where is Delombre hiding?

816
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:14,569
I couldn't say. All I know is
he wanted to take a vacation.

817
01:01:15,272 --> 01:01:17,763
You think he's basking in the sun?

818
01:01:17,874 --> 01:01:20,741
I advise you not to do the same.

819
01:01:23,747 --> 01:01:26,807
I don't intend to, Madame.

820
01:01:28,585 --> 01:01:33,318
- You also know Mr. Boldi?
- Yes, of course.

821
01:01:33,490 --> 01:01:38,223
I suppose your activities
are also unconnected.

822
01:01:39,629 --> 01:01:43,087
Yes, of course.
They're unconnected.

823
01:01:43,266 --> 01:01:47,703
Thank you. I won't keep you.
Please sign your statement.

824
01:01:47,804 --> 01:01:54,209
Of course I might... In fact,
I probably will question you again.

825
01:01:54,311 --> 01:01:56,006
Don't go too far.

826
01:01:57,314 --> 01:01:59,942
Holeo will talk. He's petrified.

827
01:02:00,384 --> 01:02:01,817
Any headway with Lange?

828
01:02:01,918 --> 01:02:04,887
None. I'm afraid he's way down
the totem pole.

829
01:02:04,988 --> 01:02:07,218
Give me one more shot with him.

830
01:02:07,324 --> 01:02:10,953
No, keep him.
I'm pulling on another thread.

831
01:02:12,162 --> 01:02:14,596
Benoît, did you listen to us
on the radio last night?

832
01:02:14,698 --> 01:02:15,392
Sure.

833
01:02:15,499 --> 01:02:17,660
- Was it good?
- As usual, Madame.

834
01:02:17,768 --> 01:02:20,601
- Was I good, too?
- Very good, Madame.

835
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:24,904
It arrived this morning.
It's a letter of denunciation.

836
01:02:25,008 --> 01:02:27,169
Again?
It never ceases to amaze me.

837
01:02:27,277 --> 01:02:30,246
- Humeau's babe.
- I recognized her. But why you?

838
01:02:30,347 --> 01:02:33,248
- To save you work.
- But I'm interested!

839
01:02:34,851 --> 01:02:35,783
I like Humeau.

840
01:02:37,687 --> 01:02:40,155
Let's go check out the slut's flat.

841
01:02:40,290 --> 01:02:43,726
- Up for it?
- It will be a nice change.

842
01:03:40,984 --> 01:03:42,611
You're still here?

843
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:44,287
Orders, sir.

844
01:03:45,088 --> 01:03:46,680
Sorry.

845
01:04:51,821 --> 01:04:53,846
Come to bed.
What are you doing?

846
01:04:54,157 --> 01:04:56,523
This can't go on.

847
01:05:01,598 --> 01:05:04,499
- You hear me?
- I hear you.

848
01:05:05,902 --> 01:05:07,426
I hear.

849
01:05:11,341 --> 01:05:13,070
What you say and don't say.

850
01:05:13,376 --> 01:05:15,139
It's my job.

851
01:05:15,946 --> 01:05:20,246
You're investigating me?
What's in my head?

852
01:05:20,817 --> 01:05:25,151
You don't give a shit about anyone.
That's the truth.

853
01:05:27,991 --> 01:05:31,483
- Are you nuts?
- Either they go or I go!

854
01:05:31,795 --> 01:05:34,662
They protect us.
Spare me your fantasies.

855
01:05:34,898 --> 01:05:37,298
You're perfect.

856
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:39,698
Smooth as stone.

857
01:05:43,306 --> 01:05:45,934
Who do you think I do this for?

858
01:05:49,679 --> 01:05:51,613
For who?

859
01:05:54,851 --> 01:05:57,376
Sure, don't answer.
It's much easier.

860
01:05:59,122 --> 01:06:01,283
The ivory tower.

861
01:06:04,427 --> 01:06:08,887
That's your mother's stare.
You've become a stranger.

862
01:06:13,036 --> 01:06:15,163
So have you.

863
01:06:16,806 --> 01:06:20,071
We're shadows who sometimes meet
in a guarded flat.

864
01:06:20,176 --> 01:06:23,077
Who am I to you?
Do you know?

865
01:06:25,315 --> 01:06:27,783
Stop playing with your wedding ring.

866
01:06:28,652 --> 01:06:30,813
Take it off, if it bothers you.

867
01:06:36,092 --> 01:06:37,923
What are you doing?

868
01:06:55,679 --> 01:06:57,647
What are you doing?

869
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:05,014
Do you know what you're doing?
Do you know?

870
01:07:05,755 --> 01:07:07,382
This is your house.

871
01:07:08,625 --> 01:07:10,889
It's your house, so I'm leaving.

872
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,399
Let's go.

873
01:07:57,740 --> 01:08:00,231
- Do you want me to drive?
- No, it's okay.

874
01:08:00,743 --> 01:08:02,608
Where to, Madam?

875
01:08:03,913 --> 01:08:05,904
Where to?

876
01:08:06,715 --> 01:08:08,205
The office, as usual.

877
01:08:08,517 --> 01:08:09,916
It's 4 a.m.

878
01:08:10,820 --> 01:08:12,310
Yes.

879
01:08:13,322 --> 01:08:16,655
Let's go to the office.
Where else?

880
01:08:32,241 --> 01:08:33,640
Get down!

881
01:08:42,251 --> 01:08:43,513
All clear.

882
01:08:43,619 --> 01:08:45,246
You can get up, Madam.

883
01:08:45,354 --> 01:08:46,343
Sorry.

884
01:08:46,522 --> 01:08:48,456
DIE BITCH

885
01:08:48,724 --> 01:08:51,124
- You okay?
- I'm okay.

886
01:09:40,910 --> 01:09:44,311
- Where did you find that?
- In the clerk's closet.

887
01:09:45,281 --> 01:09:49,775
- Did you find what's missing?
- How can I, in that mess?

888
01:09:49,885 --> 01:09:54,515
- Here, this is real coffee.
- That's sweet.

889
01:09:55,457 --> 01:09:56,549
I called the agency.

890
01:09:56,725 --> 01:09:59,523
They have a 700 sq. ft. rental nearby.

891
01:10:00,129 --> 01:10:02,893
Too big. I just need a studio.

892
01:10:03,132 --> 01:10:04,963
We'll find you one.

893
01:10:05,501 --> 01:10:07,435
Good morning.

894
01:10:07,536 --> 01:10:10,801
- You're already here?
- If you only knew, Benoît.

895
01:10:11,407 --> 01:10:14,501
Thanks for everything.
Now I have work to do.

896
01:10:16,245 --> 01:10:19,874
- You'll manage?
- I may not look it, but I'm strong.

897
01:10:20,583 --> 01:10:22,710
We'll find you a flat.

898
01:10:24,453 --> 01:10:25,784
Looking for a flat?

899
01:10:32,361 --> 01:10:34,522
That's my coffee maker!

900
01:10:36,999 --> 01:10:39,695
I never handled commissions.

901
01:10:39,802 --> 01:10:41,702
So, I don't know
about suitcase sizes...

902
01:10:43,105 --> 01:10:46,438
Don't play with me, Mr. Holeo.
It's beneath you.

903
01:10:47,509 --> 01:10:49,238
So, how did the money
move around?

904
01:10:49,545 --> 01:10:51,206
I have no idea.

905
01:10:51,313 --> 01:10:54,874
I talk with leaders,
to find out what they want.

906
01:10:55,150 --> 01:10:57,584
Now I get it, you do the haggling.

907
01:10:57,753 --> 01:10:59,186
The chit-chat.

908
01:10:59,288 --> 01:11:03,691
Down there, a good chit-chat
means a good deal.

909
01:11:04,159 --> 01:11:07,185
You chew the fat to make a deal
for the group.

910
01:11:07,296 --> 01:11:08,627
Different customs.

911
01:11:08,998 --> 01:11:11,296
How do the secret funds work?

912
01:11:13,268 --> 01:11:14,565
That's what you call it.

913
01:11:14,670 --> 01:11:19,107
They're funds made available
by heads of state.

914
01:11:19,208 --> 01:11:21,073
It's normal.
It's the same everywhere.

915
01:11:21,176 --> 01:11:25,044
Some are transferred
to various organizations,

916
01:11:25,147 --> 01:11:31,575
usually charities, or organizations
that help themselves.

917
01:11:32,488 --> 01:11:35,685
Great, in countries where
you can die of appendicitis!

918
01:11:36,358 --> 01:11:40,988
I deplore it as much as you do.
Believe me, I'm sincere.

919
01:11:50,939 --> 01:11:53,134
Excuse me.

920
01:11:53,242 --> 01:11:57,303
Could we postpone this interview?

921
01:11:57,413 --> 01:12:00,109
I'm not well.
I have heart trouble.

922
01:12:00,449 --> 01:12:03,941
Of course.
My clerk will see you out.

923
01:12:04,053 --> 01:12:05,850
There's no need.

924
01:12:07,356 --> 01:12:12,123
- Thank you for your kindness.
- I don't want to kill the sinner.

925
01:12:14,496 --> 01:12:18,159
- I was awful.
- You're tired.

926
01:12:20,636 --> 01:12:25,164
Marco told me about last night.
Never a dull moment!

927
01:12:25,507 --> 01:12:30,809
- Did Holeo break down?
- It's rather me who broke down.

928
01:12:30,913 --> 01:12:33,643
He's tougher than he looks.

929
01:12:33,749 --> 01:12:37,185
- He did the dying man number.
- Everyone knows he's sick.

930
01:12:37,286 --> 01:12:38,913
We located Delombre.

931
01:12:39,021 --> 01:12:40,784
- Where?
- The Caribbean.

932
01:12:40,889 --> 01:12:43,722
We'll have to forget him
for the moment.

933
01:12:45,227 --> 01:12:48,253
I'm so tired, I don't give a damn.

934
01:12:49,598 --> 01:12:51,759
Marco told me you're flat-hunting.

935
01:12:51,867 --> 01:12:54,062
It's none of my business,

936
01:12:54,169 --> 01:12:57,730
but you can stay at my place
in the meantime.

937
01:13:06,348 --> 01:13:10,250
Sorry, gentlemen.
A flat tire.

938
01:13:10,352 --> 01:13:12,912
Just my luck.
I'll go wash my hands.

939
01:13:18,260 --> 01:13:20,751
Why did they put this one in charge?

940
01:13:20,863 --> 01:13:25,391
I preferred Michel,
but Sibaud has certain qualities.

941
01:13:25,501 --> 01:13:29,904
Be serious, Boldi.
He's as stiff as a board.

942
01:13:30,005 --> 01:13:33,406
They'll soon pay him off
with a pad of stock options.

943
01:13:34,276 --> 01:13:35,140
What a shame!

944
01:13:36,011 --> 01:13:38,980
- A flat, the one time I drive.
- How unfortunate!

945
01:13:39,081 --> 01:13:43,074
- Champagne?
- I would love some, Boldi.

946
01:13:46,188 --> 01:13:51,182
- How did it go with the judge?
- Your girlfriend?

947
01:13:51,293 --> 01:13:55,229
I cut our conversation short.
I wanted to see you first.

948
01:13:55,864 --> 01:13:58,992
Did you read the rants
of our friend Humeau?

949
01:14:00,269 --> 01:14:02,203
You have my complete trust.

950
01:14:02,304 --> 01:14:04,772
I'll talk to the press, too.

951
01:14:04,873 --> 01:14:09,003
That's kind of you,
but I wanted to say...

952
01:14:09,111 --> 01:14:12,444
I believe you've offended
our friends.

953
01:14:12,815 --> 01:14:16,273
They would have preferred you
to go down there.

954
01:14:16,385 --> 01:14:20,754
You can't settle everything
via your computer, Mr. Chairman.

955
01:14:23,792 --> 01:14:25,453
Don't worry, old man.

956
01:14:25,561 --> 01:14:28,655
- I know what I'm doing.
- Taittinger!

957
01:14:28,931 --> 01:14:30,922
We're spoiling you.

958
01:14:33,769 --> 01:14:35,430
I can see that.

959
01:14:48,584 --> 01:14:52,076
Did Jean-Baptiste tell you
about the CIA?

960
01:14:52,187 --> 01:14:54,621
Yes, the CIA was there.

961
01:14:54,723 --> 01:14:56,657
Everyone was, in fact.

962
01:14:57,860 --> 01:15:01,489
Look, I know what I say.

963
01:15:03,165 --> 01:15:05,030
And I know what I'm doing.

964
01:15:19,047 --> 01:15:20,537
Nice of you to visit!

965
01:15:20,649 --> 01:15:22,810
- Good timing.
- As usual.

966
01:15:22,918 --> 01:15:25,682
- What's the box?
- I'll explain.

967
01:15:26,521 --> 01:15:31,151
- Smaller than my place, but nice.
- Enough for me.

968
01:15:31,260 --> 01:15:33,956
- You didn't like your friend's place?
- Sure, she's sweet.

969
01:15:34,062 --> 01:15:37,498
But a week was enough.
So what's the box?

970
01:15:37,733 --> 01:15:41,100
I don't know.
It came two days ago.

971
01:15:41,203 --> 01:15:43,694
Philippe asked me to bring it to you.

972
01:15:44,940 --> 01:15:46,635
How is he doing?

973
01:15:47,009 --> 01:15:49,500
Not too cheerful.
It's understandable.

974
01:15:50,345 --> 01:15:52,040
Where do you stand with him?

975
01:15:52,147 --> 01:15:54,707
Nowhere. I'm waiting.

976
01:15:54,917 --> 01:15:58,318
I won't force him to take
the first step, and yet...

977
01:15:59,288 --> 01:16:00,983
What do you think?

978
01:16:01,089 --> 01:16:03,683
I don't want to interfere.

979
01:16:09,498 --> 01:16:11,295
Guess who it's from?
Jacques Sibaud.

980
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:13,334
He's bullshitting me.

981
01:16:13,902 --> 01:16:16,063
No, he's not.

982
01:16:16,171 --> 01:16:20,164
He's backing Holeo.
He still trusts him.

983
01:16:20,275 --> 01:16:23,506
He's just trying to use me.
I'll send back his wine.

984
01:16:23,612 --> 01:16:27,207
Don't do that.
I'm thirsty all of a sudden.

985
01:16:27,416 --> 01:16:31,352
We'll see. Anyhow, he's late.
I had Boldi arrested.

986
01:16:31,553 --> 01:16:34,545
- You did? He's in jail?
- Yes, he is.

987
01:16:34,656 --> 01:16:37,887
While they plot behind my back,
I'm pulling out the heavy artillery.

988
01:16:37,993 --> 01:16:39,483
Look.

989
01:16:42,164 --> 01:16:43,153
Isn't he cute?

990
01:16:43,565 --> 01:16:45,533
You're right.
They'll be careful.

991
01:16:45,634 --> 01:16:47,568
I've gone into high gear.

992
01:16:47,669 --> 01:16:48,897
You know, Boldi...

993
01:16:49,404 --> 01:16:50,894
He's the kickback king.

994
01:16:51,006 --> 01:16:55,102
If it's done right,
it's overhead and tax deductible.

995
01:16:55,344 --> 01:16:58,836
Or in a Swiss bank
where names become numbers.

996
01:16:58,947 --> 01:17:03,441
That's what I'm after.
The names behind the numbers.

997
01:17:03,552 --> 01:17:06,749
They'll never let you poke around.
Too risky.

998
01:17:06,855 --> 01:17:09,221
I have certain powers, you know.

999
01:17:09,324 --> 01:17:11,622
- The powers you're granted.
- I don't care.

1000
01:17:11,727 --> 01:17:15,561
I know I can smoke
the poachers out of the woods.

1001
01:17:17,366 --> 01:17:18,799
What are you looking at?

1002
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:22,131
You. I'm looking at you,
and listening.

1003
01:17:22,237 --> 01:17:25,206
You look like a shrink.
Try it. You'd make a mint.

1004
01:17:25,507 --> 01:17:26,633
You're nuts.

1005
01:17:26,808 --> 01:17:30,608
I'd spend my day on the couch.
Snoozing, of course.

1006
01:17:31,713 --> 01:17:33,510
What a shame.

1007
01:17:34,249 --> 01:17:38,242
You're the only one I can talk to.
I can't with others.

1008
01:17:38,353 --> 01:17:40,981
I can't give you much.

1009
01:17:41,957 --> 01:17:46,951
I'm not asking for anything.
I just need you to listen.

1010
01:17:47,062 --> 01:17:50,759
- Okay, but I'm thirsty.
- Shall we open a bottle?

1011
01:17:50,866 --> 01:17:53,994
You're nuts!
It needs to rest at least two weeks.

1012
01:17:55,003 --> 01:17:57,130
I'll take you to the local bar.

1013
01:17:59,107 --> 01:18:01,166
You're a good boy.

1014
01:18:06,915 --> 01:18:10,180
If politics involves
pressing on soft spots,

1015
01:18:10,285 --> 01:18:12,685
you have to expect turbulence.

1016
01:18:12,921 --> 01:18:15,082
This judge is impossible.

1017
01:18:15,190 --> 01:18:17,818
She doesn't get
the rules of the game.

1018
01:18:17,993 --> 01:18:20,461
When you know how she started!

1019
01:18:20,562 --> 01:18:22,029
How?

1020
01:18:22,130 --> 01:18:26,396
As a student, she boarded
with the Charmant family.

1021
01:18:26,601 --> 01:18:29,161
I heard she cleaned their house.

1022
01:18:29,271 --> 01:18:32,536
Must have done right,
since she married the son.

1023
01:18:32,641 --> 01:18:35,906
- A successful takeover.
- She moved out.

1024
01:18:36,478 --> 01:18:37,672
She rented a studio.

1025
01:18:37,979 --> 01:18:40,209
- How do you know?
- I just know.

1026
01:18:40,382 --> 01:18:43,249
Anyway, I'm sick of her
snooping around.

1027
01:18:43,418 --> 01:18:45,909
We didn't expect Sibaud
to be useless.

1028
01:18:47,222 --> 01:18:51,318
He's totally inflexible.
He can't move his ass.

1029
01:18:51,426 --> 01:18:54,953
I hope the others hold out.
The natives are up in arms.

1030
01:19:11,546 --> 01:19:14,140
Have a seat. My colleague
will take your statement.

1031
01:19:14,249 --> 01:19:15,477
Here we go, sir.

1032
01:19:15,584 --> 01:19:16,744
The last act.

1033
01:19:18,386 --> 01:19:20,911
We can't reach your wife.
Is that normal?

1034
01:19:21,223 --> 01:19:22,850
My wife?

1035
01:19:28,697 --> 01:19:31,325
You can talk with your mouth full,
Mr. Boldi?

1036
01:19:31,766 --> 01:19:34,394
It's to quit smoking.

1037
01:19:34,603 --> 01:19:36,264
No, thanks.

1038
01:19:36,638 --> 01:19:41,337
Tell me, Mr. Boldi, does an envelope
of $800,000 ring a bell?

1039
01:19:41,776 --> 01:19:50,946
Madam, money is the oil you use
to grease the gears

1040
01:19:51,086 --> 01:19:54,351
so that the market runs properly.

1041
01:19:54,956 --> 01:19:57,948
An envelope of $800,000...

1042
01:19:59,161 --> 01:20:01,356
It doesn't mean a thing.

1043
01:20:02,230 --> 01:20:03,822
It's peanuts!

1044
01:20:06,935 --> 01:20:08,596
I put myself in your shoes.

1045
01:20:09,137 --> 01:20:13,836
All this work, all these files,
these thousands of pages.

1046
01:20:14,276 --> 01:20:21,114
And I'm told you keep office hours
at the courthouse on weekends,

1047
01:20:21,216 --> 01:20:24,811
as well as your time in court.

1048
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:28,614
I wonder how you manage.

1049
01:20:29,357 --> 01:20:31,484
Answer my questions,
and I'll tell you.

1050
01:20:31,693 --> 01:20:34,127
Frankly, I admire you.

1051
01:20:36,031 --> 01:20:38,158
I've thought it over.

1052
01:20:39,568 --> 01:20:44,801
Never mind a change of cell.
I want to get out.

1053
01:20:46,741 --> 01:20:50,802
I understand.
Prisons aren't up to snuff.

1054
01:20:52,147 --> 01:20:54,741
Understand me, Mrs. Charmant.

1055
01:20:54,849 --> 01:20:58,808
I wouldn't want
to be taken for a ride.

1056
01:20:59,554 --> 01:21:02,751
I don't intend to take you
for a ride, Mr. Boldi.

1057
01:21:16,938 --> 01:21:20,305
My power lies in my address book.

1058
01:21:22,077 --> 01:21:23,544
Big deal.

1059
01:21:23,645 --> 01:21:26,113
I know them all.
They've all been indicted.

1060
01:21:26,214 --> 01:21:31,481
Delombre hasn't.
He's on the run in the tropics.

1061
01:21:31,586 --> 01:21:33,554
The party funding, that's him.

1062
01:21:33,655 --> 01:21:35,384
Not to mention...

1063
01:21:36,691 --> 01:21:38,625
A lot of other things.

1064
01:21:38,727 --> 01:21:42,720
That's why he's lying low abroad.
Official secret.

1065
01:21:43,298 --> 01:21:44,788
Does Sibaud know?

1066
01:21:44,899 --> 01:21:46,457
Sibaud!

1067
01:21:48,970 --> 01:21:51,063
He knows.

1068
01:21:52,040 --> 01:21:56,272
Without knowing,
even though he does know.

1069
01:21:56,578 --> 01:22:01,641
He's the one with signature power.

1070
01:22:02,017 --> 01:22:04,577
So he gives his trust.

1071
01:22:06,621 --> 01:22:09,488
He doesn't look, he just signs.

1072
01:22:11,259 --> 01:22:15,889
He forks out like everyone...

1073
01:22:16,097 --> 01:22:17,394
Or else he's dead.

1074
01:22:17,766 --> 01:22:18,562
Excuse me?

1075
01:22:22,003 --> 01:22:25,097
Humeau, for instance.
He's dead.

1076
01:22:25,607 --> 01:22:27,734
Where did he go wrong?

1077
01:22:28,076 --> 01:22:29,907
Him...

1078
01:22:30,211 --> 01:22:31,803
He's special.

1079
01:22:32,213 --> 01:22:35,740
It's more a matter
of personal incompatibility.

1080
01:22:35,850 --> 01:22:39,308
But getting back to the cash...

1081
01:22:39,421 --> 01:22:44,415
Before you extract,
you have to grease palms.

1082
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:49,793
We grease the leaders' palms,
they take the cash,

1083
01:22:49,898 --> 01:22:52,458
and they do what they want with it.

1084
01:22:55,804 --> 01:22:59,262
The books are separate.
But it's not against the law.

1085
01:22:59,374 --> 01:23:02,343
It's even endorsed by customs.

1086
01:23:02,444 --> 01:23:06,278
No one talks about it, that's all.
It's taboo, but normal.

1087
01:23:06,481 --> 01:23:08,676
And Jacques Sibaud does the same?

1088
01:23:10,652 --> 01:23:12,210
The same procedure?

1089
01:23:15,423 --> 01:23:17,653
Sibaud!

1090
01:23:19,794 --> 01:23:21,284
He is a spectator.

1091
01:23:21,396 --> 01:23:24,627
Give him a desert,
in six months the sand's gone.

1092
01:23:24,733 --> 01:23:27,224
When you do business,
you move, you take risks.

1093
01:23:27,335 --> 01:23:29,360
Sibaud's hopeless.

1094
01:23:31,106 --> 01:23:38,603
Madam, squealing on people
at my age feels very strange.

1095
01:23:40,048 --> 01:23:42,573
I understand you, Mr. Boldi.

1096
01:23:42,684 --> 01:23:45,551
But if you can't stand prison...

1097
01:23:45,887 --> 01:23:48,321
I saw that poor Humeau.

1098
01:23:51,092 --> 01:23:53,083
I feel sorry for him.

1099
01:23:53,895 --> 01:23:55,260
He's like a zombie.

1100
01:23:57,766 --> 01:23:59,427
He took it hard.

1101
01:23:59,534 --> 01:24:02,128
But let's not dramatize.
He'll get over it.

1102
01:24:03,371 --> 01:24:05,862
My colleague is signing his release.

1103
01:24:06,474 --> 01:24:09,637
You made the right decision,
Mr. Boldi.

1104
01:24:10,712 --> 01:24:12,304
Go on. I'm listening.

1105
01:25:38,765 --> 01:25:40,232
- Search warrant!
- You can't.

1106
01:25:40,334 --> 01:25:41,358
I can.

1107
01:25:59,319 --> 01:26:01,719
Glad to see you!

1108
01:26:03,423 --> 01:26:05,323
What are you doing here?

1109
01:26:06,159 --> 01:26:07,353
Give that back.

1110
01:26:07,528 --> 01:26:10,793
- No way. It goes under seals.
- I bet.

1111
01:26:19,206 --> 01:26:20,696
- That's illegal.
- Think so?

1112
01:26:20,807 --> 01:26:23,105
This is entirely legitimate.

1113
01:26:23,210 --> 01:26:28,011
I only enter golf scores on my
computer, to calculate my handicap.

1114
01:26:28,115 --> 01:26:29,673
How is it?

1115
01:26:30,884 --> 01:26:32,579
You have to sign.

1116
01:26:32,686 --> 01:26:36,554
- No way.
- Don't be childish. It could cost you.

1117
01:26:43,397 --> 01:26:44,694
The key to the safe.

1118
01:26:45,432 --> 01:26:47,423
- I said, the key!
- I don't have it.

1119
01:26:47,534 --> 01:26:49,092
As you like.

1120
01:26:51,004 --> 01:26:52,631
- What are they doing?
- Their job.

1121
01:26:52,739 --> 01:26:54,730
Behind the panel.

1122
01:26:58,946 --> 01:27:01,642
- This is ridiculous.
- I agree.

1123
01:27:21,301 --> 01:27:24,498
- Two black books.
- You can't. They're confidential.

1124
01:27:24,605 --> 01:27:27,506
You're overstepping
your prerogatives.

1125
01:27:28,308 --> 01:27:31,709
Look, Mr. Sibaud.
You're the one who came to me.

1126
01:27:31,812 --> 01:27:35,248
Frankly, we're a long way
from where we started.

1127
01:27:35,349 --> 01:27:39,012
We both knew that,
right from the beginning.

1128
01:27:39,753 --> 01:27:41,653
That's why I won't allow this.

1129
01:27:41,755 --> 01:27:43,052
Jeanne!

1130
01:29:12,913 --> 01:29:17,077
- Sorry. Did I scare you?
- No, it's me. I'm silly.

1131
01:29:17,751 --> 01:29:20,219
A <i>pan bagnat</i>, from my region.

1132
01:29:21,388 --> 01:29:23,481
That's sweet of you.

1133
01:29:23,924 --> 01:29:25,789
I'm so tired.

1134
01:29:27,494 --> 01:29:31,123
We're here, Madam.
We'll always be here for you.

1135
01:29:31,298 --> 01:29:33,425
That's sweet of you.

1136
01:29:33,633 --> 01:29:35,794
Didn't I already say that?

1137
01:29:43,376 --> 01:29:46,345
- You overslept?
- Sorry, I broke down.

1138
01:29:46,446 --> 01:29:48,914
- How did Sibaud take it?
- In his own way.

1139
01:29:49,015 --> 01:29:51,950
- He'll use his golden parachute.
- The poor thing.

1140
01:29:52,052 --> 01:29:53,110
How much?

1141
01:29:54,054 --> 01:29:55,180
That much?

1142
01:29:56,823 --> 01:29:59,223
- Hello, Madam.
- Hello, Benoît. Did you sleep well?

1143
01:29:59,326 --> 01:30:00,418
Very well, thanks.

1144
01:30:00,527 --> 01:30:03,121
More hate mail, two letters today.

1145
01:30:03,296 --> 01:30:04,263
Only two?

1146
01:30:04,364 --> 01:30:06,855
At times, I think I'm being followed.

1147
01:30:06,967 --> 01:30:09,868
- Isn't it flattering?
- You're out of control today!

1148
01:30:09,970 --> 01:30:12,700
That's good,
because we've got work to do.

1149
01:30:12,806 --> 01:30:15,502
Let me guess.
Delombre's back in town?

1150
01:30:15,609 --> 01:30:18,806
You got it. With his lawyers,
Wogner and Parlebas.

1151
01:30:18,912 --> 01:30:20,573
- I like him.
- Good.

1152
01:30:20,680 --> 01:30:23,945
We see them at 3:00,
with their tanned client.

1153
01:30:24,050 --> 01:30:26,883
They're usually tanned, aren't they?

1154
01:30:27,020 --> 01:30:28,544
How will you handle it?

1155
01:30:28,655 --> 01:30:30,350
Very simply.

1156
01:30:30,457 --> 01:30:34,917
I let him do his spiel, then I read
the charges, and I book him.

1157
01:30:36,029 --> 01:30:37,087
From sun to shade.

1158
01:30:42,202 --> 01:30:45,228
I was amazed when he swallowed
his cellphone chip.

1159
01:30:45,338 --> 01:30:46,737
What a nutcase!

1160
01:30:46,840 --> 01:30:49,832
No, like all crooks,
he's done his thinking.

1161
01:30:49,943 --> 01:30:53,674
He figures they'll be grateful.
The rabble fears oblivion.

1162
01:30:53,780 --> 01:30:55,748
- Martino!
- Where?

1163
01:31:02,689 --> 01:31:03,849
Your Honor,

1164
01:31:03,957 --> 01:31:07,620
will you toast the outcome
of this investigation with us?

1165
01:31:08,061 --> 01:31:09,323
Temper your joy.

1166
01:31:09,429 --> 01:31:12,091
I'm glad the law is the same for all.

1167
01:31:12,199 --> 01:31:14,360
There are journalists upstairs.

1168
01:31:14,467 --> 01:31:17,959
Celebrating an arrest
is bad for our image.

1169
01:31:18,071 --> 01:31:21,165
- See you tomorrow.
- Tomorrow is Sunday.

1170
01:31:21,608 --> 01:31:23,508
I'll see you on Monday.

1171
01:31:31,384 --> 01:31:34,319
Your friend will talk.
So will the others.

1172
01:31:34,421 --> 01:31:38,448
They'll tell all and drag you down.
I have to tell you.

1173
01:31:38,558 --> 01:31:40,355
I'm not part of their schemes.

1174
01:31:40,460 --> 01:31:43,327
The judge will say
you didn't stop them.

1175
01:31:43,430 --> 01:31:44,829
What will you reply?

1176
01:31:44,931 --> 01:31:46,193
I have other options.

1177
01:31:46,299 --> 01:31:49,200
- We've gone whole hog.
- Oh, please!

1178
01:31:49,302 --> 01:31:52,465
Your group is bled white.
You can't say no.

1179
01:31:52,572 --> 01:31:55,040
I understand how you feel,
but it's true.

1180
01:31:55,141 --> 01:31:56,836
You've hit bottom.

1181
01:31:57,310 --> 01:31:58,971
Don't kid yourselves.

1182
01:31:59,079 --> 01:32:02,515
We're all in the same boat,
and we've hit a storm.

1183
01:32:02,616 --> 01:32:08,714
But the wind is dropping, and
the ship has held up rather well.

1184
01:32:09,022 --> 01:32:13,220
Senator, I don't know if your optimism
impresses or worries me.

1185
01:32:15,629 --> 01:32:19,929
It's an objective analysis
of the situation.

1186
01:32:20,500 --> 01:32:24,266
- What do you think?
- Things are settling down.

1187
01:32:24,437 --> 01:32:28,931
- The group's getting devoured.
- All because of that jerk Sibaud.

1188
01:32:29,042 --> 01:32:34,571
So let's think positive, as they say.

1189
01:32:34,814 --> 01:32:38,773
- At least Sibaud's off our back.
- At what price?

1190
01:32:38,885 --> 01:32:42,412
True, he did get
a golden handshake.

1191
01:32:42,756 --> 01:32:45,384
- As you say.
- Good for him.

1192
01:32:46,059 --> 01:32:50,086
But otherwise,
the system held up well.

1193
01:32:50,196 --> 01:32:55,224
And I'm sure our friends in trouble
can withstand the pressure.

1194
01:32:56,102 --> 01:32:58,900
- Boldi, for instance.
- Oh, him!

1195
01:32:59,205 --> 01:33:03,266
That's another story.
We'll deal with Boldi later.

1196
01:33:03,576 --> 01:33:05,703
The group may have been
gobbled up,

1197
01:33:05,812 --> 01:33:07,780
but our structure is intact.

1198
01:33:08,648 --> 01:33:09,580
For now!

1199
01:33:11,484 --> 01:33:13,782
Don't be so negative.

1200
01:33:14,020 --> 01:33:17,456
Your father's bank
changed names, didn't it?

1201
01:33:17,891 --> 01:33:21,850
You got swallowed up, too.
Did it change anything?

1202
01:33:21,962 --> 01:33:25,955
You got reorganized.
We'll reorganize, too!

1203
01:33:26,266 --> 01:33:30,532
What about that woman,
that diabolical judge?

1204
01:33:30,637 --> 01:33:32,332
Will she keep making trouble for us?

1205
01:33:32,672 --> 01:33:36,836
I understand
she's getting a promotion.

1206
01:33:38,345 --> 01:33:41,337
Again.
The last one was a disaster.

1207
01:33:41,448 --> 01:33:49,856
I admit it was something
of a shambles, and we got taken.

1208
01:33:50,156 --> 01:33:53,125
We were wrong to give her
that associate.

1209
01:33:54,728 --> 01:33:57,026
This brandy is excellent.

1210
01:33:57,297 --> 01:34:01,199
<i>Your file says,</i>
<i>"He sent his boy for caviar."</i>

1211
01:34:01,301 --> 01:34:03,929
<i>I'm not going down over caviar!</i>

1212
01:34:04,471 --> 01:34:08,237
<i>The lifestyle doesn't go</i>
<i>with the official salaries.</i>

1213
01:34:08,341 --> 01:34:10,400
<i>What do I plead?</i>

1214
01:34:11,378 --> 01:34:14,541
<i>Tax exemption, reinvestment...</i>

1215
01:34:14,647 --> 01:34:16,740
<i>It's pragmatic.</i>

1216
01:34:17,283 --> 01:34:19,114
<i>It's legal.</i>

1217
01:34:20,820 --> 01:34:22,378
What isn't legal?

1218
01:34:22,655 --> 01:34:24,623
<i>Who cares what they do!</i>

1219
01:34:24,724 --> 01:34:28,319
<i>Let them keep fighting it out.</i>
<i>They're animals.</i>

1220
01:34:28,528 --> 01:34:32,020
<i>Elephants dance together,</i>
<i>you dance alone.</i>

1221
01:34:32,132 --> 01:34:34,464
<i>Merge while there's still time.</i>

1222
01:34:34,667 --> 01:34:37,534
<i>Not credible. Too small.</i>

1223
01:34:37,737 --> 01:34:41,639
<i>I'm warning you,</i>
<i>there's a facelift in the offing.</i>

1224
01:34:41,875 --> 01:34:45,333
Sounds like the BBC during the war.
"London calling."

1225
01:34:45,445 --> 01:34:47,572
What does he mean by a facelift?

1226
01:34:47,680 --> 01:34:50,945
That they're on the alert.
They're selling off.

1227
01:34:51,051 --> 01:34:57,354
And to avoid an audit,
they buy off sleazy politicians.

1228
01:34:57,457 --> 01:34:59,982
So what do we do?
Everyone's controlled.

1229
01:35:00,093 --> 01:35:02,493
- It's the rule.
- What is?

1230
01:35:02,595 --> 01:35:05,086
Invoke state security
to let your pals get rich?

1231
01:35:05,465 --> 01:35:07,899
I'm not saying it's moral,
but it's the rule.

1232
01:35:08,001 --> 01:35:11,903
The Presiding Judge
wants to see you.

1233
01:35:12,005 --> 01:35:14,132
Damn!

1234
01:35:18,445 --> 01:35:20,777
Time flies with you.

1235
01:35:28,154 --> 01:35:31,419
- Yes?
- Madam Charmant-Killman.

1236
01:35:31,524 --> 01:35:33,617
Send her in.

1237
01:35:40,733 --> 01:35:45,067
- You don't look so good.
- I'm okay. Just a little tired.

1238
01:35:46,039 --> 01:35:48,030
How are you coming along?

1239
01:35:48,141 --> 01:35:53,909
I contacted my Swiss counterpart.
He explained the system.

1240
01:35:54,013 --> 01:35:58,143
The funds go through various money
markets, then they end up in London.

1241
01:35:59,319 --> 01:36:00,980
You're moving fast!

1242
01:36:01,454 --> 01:36:03,046
I have to.

1243
01:36:03,156 --> 01:36:05,386
I'm counting on you
to contact the Chancellor.

1244
01:36:06,025 --> 01:36:12,521
Look, calm down and listen to me.
You look really beat.

1245
01:36:12,699 --> 01:36:17,068
- You should take a vacation.
- Not until the Swiss banks answer.

1246
01:36:17,804 --> 01:36:19,135
The situation's changed.

1247
01:36:19,806 --> 01:36:23,333
The new group intends to start
on a new footing.

1248
01:36:23,443 --> 01:36:25,502
I don't believe a word of it.

1249
01:36:26,279 --> 01:36:30,807
It will be the same, the same
schemes and new expenses.

1250
01:36:32,118 --> 01:36:34,245
You lost your objectivity.

1251
01:36:34,888 --> 01:36:36,378
I need a fresh eye.

1252
01:36:42,095 --> 01:36:43,960
What do you mean exactly?

1253
01:36:45,932 --> 01:36:49,629
I'll be honest with you.
I don't want you to run into trouble.

1254
01:36:49,736 --> 01:36:50,828
So listen to me.

1255
01:36:51,037 --> 01:36:56,669
There are too many vipers involved.
Let it rest for a while.

1256
01:36:58,244 --> 01:37:02,010
If you won't take time off,
I can have you transferred.

1257
01:37:02,115 --> 01:37:04,515
A real promotion, something good.

1258
01:37:13,826 --> 01:37:17,353
Don't they call my post
the most powerful in France?

1259
01:37:18,698 --> 01:37:20,529
They say lots of things.

1260
01:37:22,302 --> 01:37:24,497
Think it over, my dear Jeanne.

1261
01:37:24,604 --> 01:37:29,769
You know I'm very fond of you.
I'll take care of your bonus.

1262
01:37:30,243 --> 01:37:35,146
You can keep it, Your Honor.
To buy yourself a pair of balls.

1263
01:37:46,893 --> 01:37:48,554
What did he want?

1264
01:37:48,661 --> 01:37:51,459
- He thanked me.
- It's the least he could do.

1265
01:37:51,564 --> 01:37:55,500
I mean, he said to take a vacation.
He's cutting me loose.

1266
01:37:55,602 --> 01:37:57,467
Got a cigarette?

1267
01:38:01,674 --> 01:38:03,539
He said it like that?

1268
01:38:08,147 --> 01:38:11,310
He was a little uneasy.
I sent him packing.

1269
01:38:12,252 --> 01:38:13,412
What are you going to do?

1270
01:38:17,423 --> 01:38:20,790
He said he needed a fresh eye.

1271
01:38:20,893 --> 01:38:24,886
I may be paranoid, but I feel
like the victim of a conspiracy.

1272
01:38:24,998 --> 01:38:27,159
So, what are you going to do?

1273
01:38:30,937 --> 01:38:32,996
Would you take over for me?

1274
01:38:34,474 --> 01:38:36,066
If you asked me to.

1275
01:38:36,242 --> 01:38:39,837
- If I didn't?
- I'd refuse, of course.

1276
01:38:40,680 --> 01:38:42,170
Then I'm asking you to.

1277
01:38:43,449 --> 01:38:45,781
I'm not sure they'll want me.

1278
01:38:47,287 --> 01:38:52,315
They have to watch out.
The case has made too much noise.

1279
01:38:52,425 --> 01:38:54,450
So, again, what are you going to do?

1280
01:38:54,961 --> 01:38:57,088
I'm going home.

1281
01:39:30,963 --> 01:39:33,830
- What's the matter?
- I tried to call you.

1282
01:39:33,932 --> 01:39:36,332
I turned off my cell.
What is it?

1283
01:39:36,435 --> 01:39:37,902
Bad news.

1284
01:39:38,236 --> 01:39:40,864
Your husband
jumped out the window.

1285
01:39:42,841 --> 01:39:45,241
- He's dead?
- No, hospitalized.

1286
01:39:45,344 --> 01:39:47,005
I came for you.

1287
01:39:47,980 --> 01:39:50,005
The cops called.

1288
01:39:51,016 --> 01:39:53,484
They couldn't reach you.

1289
01:39:54,619 --> 01:39:57,019
They located your nephew.

1290
01:39:57,856 --> 01:40:03,123
Then I told them I'd find you
and bring you over.

1291
01:40:04,796 --> 01:40:06,696
Did they say how he is?

1292
01:40:07,099 --> 01:40:08,760
Vaguely.

1293
01:40:11,203 --> 01:40:13,364
But he's alive.

1294
01:40:17,142 --> 01:40:18,609
Alive?

1295
01:40:18,944 --> 01:40:20,138
Yes.

1296
01:40:25,851 --> 01:40:27,216
You were right.

1297
01:40:28,253 --> 01:40:33,088
Martino hinted I'd probably
take over the case.

1298
01:40:33,725 --> 01:40:35,886
For the moment, anyway.

1299
01:40:53,612 --> 01:40:54,943
- You okay?
- How is he?

1300
01:40:55,047 --> 01:40:56,480
Out of it.

1301
01:40:56,581 --> 01:40:59,482
They say his condition is serious,
but not critical.

1302
01:40:59,584 --> 01:41:02,348
- Can we see him?
- Right now there is no point.

1303
01:41:02,454 --> 01:41:04,945
But he might wake up any minute.

1304
01:41:05,057 --> 01:41:08,117
Erika, this is Felix.

1305
01:41:09,361 --> 01:41:11,852
Philippe's nephew.

1306
01:41:11,963 --> 01:41:14,523
I work with Erika.

1307
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,662
Those two hoods are cops.

1308
01:41:17,769 --> 01:41:21,170
They want to question you,
but you scare them.

1309
01:41:21,706 --> 01:41:23,537
Let's go see them.

1310
01:41:25,510 --> 01:41:29,207
- Gentlemen.
- Madam.

1311
01:41:29,848 --> 01:41:32,817
Sorry, but we need to know...

1312
01:41:32,918 --> 01:41:36,115
Do you know of a gun
in your apartment?

1313
01:41:36,221 --> 01:41:38,086
A gun?

1314
01:41:39,257 --> 01:41:41,282
No. Where?

1315
01:41:41,393 --> 01:41:44,794
In a shoebox,
wrapped in tissue paper.

1316
01:41:45,097 --> 01:41:48,191
I knew nothing about it.
What's the link?

1317
01:41:48,300 --> 01:41:52,293
We wondered why
he jumped out the window

1318
01:41:52,404 --> 01:41:55,373
when he had a gun handy.

1319
01:41:57,008 --> 01:41:59,203
Maybe he was reluctant to die.

1320
01:42:02,380 --> 01:42:05,474
What I liked right off was his smile.

1321
01:42:06,218 --> 01:42:09,153
Amid all those hypocrites,
he had that smile.

1322
01:42:09,254 --> 01:42:12,485
He said I lacked something.
That he'd tell me...

1323
01:42:12,657 --> 01:42:14,147
Some day.

1324
01:42:15,427 --> 01:42:17,657
What do I lack?

1325
01:42:18,497 --> 01:42:20,089
Ask him.

1326
01:42:22,033 --> 01:42:23,660
You think he'll pull through?

1327
01:42:23,902 --> 01:42:27,099
I think so.
I'm not ready to grieve him.

1328
01:42:27,205 --> 01:42:31,574
Madam Charmant, things look better.
His condition is stable.

1329
01:42:31,676 --> 01:42:33,007
- Can I see him?
- He's asleep.

1330
01:42:33,111 --> 01:42:35,579
Just a peek?

1331
01:42:35,680 --> 01:42:37,011
Come with me.

1332
01:42:46,925 --> 01:42:52,022
- I can't let you go in.
- I just want a peek.

1333
01:43:12,984 --> 01:43:13,678
I'm sorry.

1334
01:43:17,088 --> 01:43:18,715
Madam.

1335
01:43:27,098 --> 01:43:28,963
Mr. Chairman.

1336
01:43:29,167 --> 01:43:32,500
I heard about your husband.
I'm sorry.

1337
01:43:33,305 --> 01:43:35,569
What are you here for?
Are you ill?

1338
01:43:36,007 --> 01:43:39,408
I went into a depression
after I was released.

1339
01:43:39,678 --> 01:43:41,270
Really?

1340
01:43:42,013 --> 01:43:43,913
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

1341
01:43:44,316 --> 01:43:47,513
You weren't the cruelest
in this affair.

1342
01:43:47,619 --> 01:43:50,087
I hope it all works out, Madam.

1343
01:43:51,456 --> 01:43:54,050
So do I, Mr. Chairman.

1344
01:43:56,328 --> 01:43:57,727
Good-bye.

1345
01:44:08,340 --> 01:44:11,241
Excuse me, I must return to my flock.

1346
01:44:14,246 --> 01:44:16,146
Funny doctor.

1347
01:44:16,248 --> 01:44:20,150
People used to say that priests were
soul doctors. He's a body priest.

1348
01:44:21,686 --> 01:44:23,984
- Or a soul cop!
- What?

1349
01:44:24,489 --> 01:44:27,617
We used to say priests
were soul cops.

1350
01:44:28,059 --> 01:44:29,720
Only God can judge.

1351
01:44:30,362 --> 01:44:32,762
The real question is, what is God?

1352
01:44:34,766 --> 01:44:37,894
Another time.
I'm going to bed.

1353
01:44:38,003 --> 01:44:39,493
You should, too.

1354
01:44:42,440 --> 01:44:44,465
Go on. I want to stay.

1355
01:44:45,176 --> 01:44:46,268
You should go rest.

1356
01:44:48,246 --> 01:44:49,713
Erika's right.

1357
01:44:49,814 --> 01:44:52,510
If you stay,
Philippe will sleep, but you won't.

1358
01:44:54,185 --> 01:44:57,018
You always know
how to convince me.

1359
01:44:58,556 --> 01:45:01,684
My dear aunt, I'm a great Cartesian.

1360
01:45:02,127 --> 01:45:04,322
I feel like I'm in a dream.

1361
01:45:05,964 --> 01:45:08,432
- You want a ride?
- It's too far.

1362
01:45:08,533 --> 01:45:10,228
I'll take care of you.

1363
01:45:10,335 --> 01:45:12,030
You have a car?

1364
01:45:14,439 --> 01:45:16,202
I'm off.

1365
01:45:17,075 --> 01:45:19,839
Sleep well.
You have work tomorrow.

1366
01:45:21,012 --> 01:45:24,004
- Hope to see you soon, Erika.
- See you.

1367
01:45:25,150 --> 01:45:26,617
I forgot to tell you.

1368
01:45:26,718 --> 01:45:29,710
Your trusty clerk Benoît
is a real bastard.

1369
01:45:29,821 --> 01:45:31,254
He's the mole.

1370
01:45:31,356 --> 01:45:33,654
I caught him calling
a guy named Le Blanc.

1371
01:45:33,758 --> 01:45:36,124
- You know him?
- Yes, vaguely.

1372
01:45:36,227 --> 01:45:38,195
I'll explain tomorrow.

1373
01:45:38,296 --> 01:45:39,820
Good night.

1374
01:45:40,765 --> 01:45:42,426
Good night.

1375
01:45:44,369 --> 01:45:47,702
She has a nice ass,
but I bet she's a bit loony.

1376
01:45:47,806 --> 01:45:50,468
- What makes you say that?
- Her profession.

1377
01:45:52,210 --> 01:45:55,611
- Why not say I'm loony, too?
- I almost did.

1378
01:45:56,181 --> 01:45:57,910
There's no job without risk.

1379
01:45:58,016 --> 01:45:59,347
What's that?

1380
01:45:59,451 --> 01:46:00,440
Not bad.

1381
01:46:00,552 --> 01:46:03,544
Three jacks against two pairs,
aces high.

1382
01:46:04,989 --> 01:46:06,854
They didn't do you any favors.

1383
01:46:06,958 --> 01:46:08,755
What are you going to do?

1384
01:46:09,494 --> 01:46:11,485
Three jacks!

1385
01:46:12,330 --> 01:46:14,389
What a world!

1386
01:46:15,033 --> 01:46:16,728
You plan on continuing?

1387
01:46:19,003 --> 01:46:20,800
I don't know.

1388
01:46:27,112 --> 01:46:28,841
You did your job.

1389
01:46:28,947 --> 01:46:30,244
You cleaned up good.

1390
01:46:34,285 --> 01:46:36,685
You're naive, nephew.

1391
01:46:39,424 --> 01:46:42,757
There's still a lot of dirt
left and right.

1392
01:46:46,297 --> 01:46:47,491
Believe me.

1393
01:46:47,899 --> 01:46:49,423
So...

1394
01:46:51,403 --> 01:46:52,392
Will you keep going?

1395
01:47:05,250 --> 01:47:07,150
To hell with them.

1396
01:47:08,305 --> 01:47:14,649
