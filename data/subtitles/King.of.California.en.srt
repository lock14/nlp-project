1
00:00:20,537 --> 00:00:23,096
Technically, what happened wasn't my fault.

2
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:24,264
I'm a minor.

3
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:28,439
I'm not responsible
for my actions... technically.

4
00:00:33,851 --> 00:00:35,576
- Where are you going?
- Running away. What does it look like?

5
00:00:35,586 --> 00:00:37,344
- We gotta stick with the plan.
- No!

6
00:00:37,354 --> 00:00:41,114
But these things should be taken
on a case-by-case basis.

7
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:44,451
In our case, I've always
been the responsible party.

8
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:47,187
- We gotta get out of here.
- Stick with the plan.

9
00:00:47,197 --> 00:00:49,197
Oh, God.

10
00:00:51,101 --> 00:00:55,181
Someone had to look out for him.

11
00:00:58,408 --> 00:01:00,100
Welcome to McDonald's.

12
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:02,803
Can I have a Number 1?

13
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:05,405
Actually, can I have
a five-piece chicken?

14
00:01:05,415 --> 00:01:07,641
Um, but instead of the Coke

15
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:09,810
I want a McFlurry
with extra Oreos,

16
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,411
and make sure
they stir it in.

17
00:01:11,421 --> 00:01:15,148
And then a Number 1 with mustard, ketchup...

18
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:16,917
pickles and lettuce only.

19
00:01:16,927 --> 00:01:20,420
When my father went away,
I lived alone in our house.

20
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:25,834
Which was not exactly normal,
but at least I had a routine.

21
00:01:28,805 --> 00:01:33,166
Before, when he was home,
I could never exactly get comfortable

22
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:38,113
because it always felt like
something was about to happen.

23
00:02:33,503 --> 00:02:35,503
What?

24
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,164
Oh, yeah,
it was so weird,

25
00:02:37,174 --> 00:02:39,566
I don't know whether
I dreamt it, you know,

26
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:41,908
or heard it on the news.

27
00:02:42,012 --> 00:02:46,346
Naked Chinese men
washing ashore by the dozens

28
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:50,375
up and down
Southern California beaches

29
00:02:50,487 --> 00:02:52,717
at sunrise.

30
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,149
Boat people, you know?

31
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:59,586
The boat stops outside
the maritime limit,

32
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:01,755
they put their clothes
in plastic bags,

33
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:05,667
and they swim ashore.

34
00:03:05,736 --> 00:03:08,034
Naked Chinese guys.

35
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:10,105
Fuckin' amazing.

36
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:16,336
Naked Chinese guys?

37
00:03:16,346 --> 00:03:18,205
Jesus Christ.

38
00:03:18,215 --> 00:03:21,785
Don't people go to hospitals
to get better?

39
00:03:44,608 --> 00:03:48,368
It would've been easier
if we'd just sold the house,

40
00:03:48,378 --> 00:03:49,770
because the way
the market was,

41
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,438
we would've cleaned up.

42
00:03:51,448 --> 00:03:53,907
But Charlie grew up
in our house;

43
00:03:53,917 --> 00:03:55,917
he refused to leave.

44
00:03:56,586 --> 00:03:59,731
Even though we were
barely getting by.

45
00:04:03,627 --> 00:04:06,787
Before I was born, he had
already lived several lives

46
00:04:06,797 --> 00:04:10,590
and managed to avoid
fatherhood for a lot of years.

47
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,595
I'm pretty sure my arrival
took him by surprise.

48
00:04:21,978 --> 00:04:25,505
Once, when things went south
for Charlie in Saint Louis,

49
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:27,607
he had to pawn that bass.

50
00:04:27,617 --> 00:04:30,811
He said that everything
really started to go wrong after that.

51
00:04:30,821 --> 00:04:33,980
And they didn't start going right again
until he found it two years later

52
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:36,458
in a pawn shop in Atlanta.

53
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:39,753
He said things were
all right after that,

54
00:04:39,763 --> 00:04:42,323
all evidence to the contrary.

55
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:09,716
Oh, shit!

56
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:26,500
What's going on?

57
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:29,240
Great things.

58
00:05:29,346 --> 00:05:31,671
So, it was time to get back

59
00:05:31,681 --> 00:05:33,974
on that ol' bipolar
pony and ride.

60
00:05:33,984 --> 00:05:37,181
Naked Chinese guys.
Hee hee hee!

61
00:05:51,034 --> 00:05:53,593
Pepper and Charlie spent
years together on the road

62
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:56,697
with a five-piece jazz combo.

63
00:05:56,773 --> 00:06:00,500
Once, after a club date
on the Kentucky side of Cincinnati,

64
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:03,403
Pepper ate so many pancakes
at a Denny's that the busboys

65
00:06:03,413 --> 00:06:07,748
had to unbolt the table
to get him out of the booth.

66
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:10,218
Hey-hey,
lookin' good, man.

67
00:06:12,088 --> 00:06:13,847
Lost some weight.

68
00:06:13,857 --> 00:06:15,615
It's the chemo.

69
00:06:18,261 --> 00:06:20,420
Hey, might as well
put that away.

70
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,888
I'm not playing anymore.

71
00:06:21,898 --> 00:06:24,560
Some other time.

72
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,626
I'm not doing that,
either.

73
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:30,902
Oh, it's a whole new
Charlie.

74
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:34,102
- Hello, Miranda.
- Hey, Pepper.

75
00:06:34,211 --> 00:06:36,211
How are you, sweetie?

76
00:06:42,085 --> 00:06:44,085
What the hell is that?

77
00:06:44,788 --> 00:06:47,723
It's my uniform.

78
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:49,791
You got a job?

79
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:52,752
Aren't you supposed
to be in school?

80
00:06:52,762 --> 00:06:54,721
No, wait. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

81
00:06:54,731 --> 00:06:56,731
Is this Christmastime?

82
00:06:58,101 --> 00:07:00,228
It's March.

83
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:04,898
Well, then, why aren't
you in school?

84
00:07:04,908 --> 00:07:07,100
I had to give
school up, Charlie.

85
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:08,501
I had to make money,
you know,

86
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:11,316
while you were gone
for two years.

87
00:07:12,616 --> 00:07:14,846
I'll be back around 10.

88
00:07:14,951 --> 00:07:16,610
You working at night?

89
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,111
Yeah.
I gotta go.

90
00:07:18,121 --> 00:07:19,980
Wait, wait,
you working at night?

91
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:22,849
I mean, that's not good.
It's not a safe place. I don't like that.

92
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,684
It's not the old McDonald's
on Alameda.

93
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:26,686
It's a new one
on Crest Parkway.

94
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,255
Crest Parkway.

95
00:07:28,265 --> 00:07:31,524
Some new neighborhood,
Tierra Buena Estates.

96
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:32,525
I don't know.

97
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:35,003
Where the fuck is that?

98
00:07:35,105 --> 00:07:36,930
Hey, can I get a ride
from you tomorrow?

99
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:39,500
I gotta see a man about a job.

100
00:07:39,609 --> 00:07:41,101
No way.

101
00:07:41,111 --> 00:07:43,511
I got an interview.

102
00:07:44,814 --> 00:07:47,534
Yeah, sure,
I'll give you a ride.

103
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:56,882
You make me laugh.

104
00:07:56,993 --> 00:07:59,719
When Charlie was in the mental hospital,

105
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:02,222
Social Services thought
I was with my mother.

106
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:05,458
And Child Welfare thought
I was with my father.

107
00:08:05,468 --> 00:08:07,394
My father thought
I was with my mother.

108
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:09,863
My mother thought
I was with a foster family.

109
00:08:09,873 --> 00:08:14,034
Somewhere, some foster family
thought I was with my father, and so on.

110
00:08:14,044 --> 00:08:15,869
Welcome to McDonald's.

111
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:18,738
By working double shifts
and keeping expenses low,

112
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:22,479
I was able to buy
a car on Ebay.

113
00:08:22,552 --> 00:08:24,711
They didn't know
who they were selling it to.

114
00:08:24,721 --> 00:08:27,013
An unlicensed 15-year-old
looks the same

115
00:08:27,023 --> 00:08:29,049
as everyone else on Ebay.

116
00:08:29,059 --> 00:08:31,484
It's like the Social Services thing,

117
00:08:31,494 --> 00:08:33,420
nobody sees anybody.

118
00:08:35,665 --> 00:08:37,724
I admit, it's a beater...

119
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:41,061
...but a safe beater.

120
00:08:46,509 --> 00:08:50,003
Things were a lot different
when Charlie was gone.

121
00:08:50,013 --> 00:08:52,174
Easier.

122
00:08:52,248 --> 00:08:55,274
In some ways,
things were wonderful.

123
00:09:04,594 --> 00:09:07,253
You always get home so late?

124
00:09:07,263 --> 00:09:09,756
It's none of your
business, Charlie.

125
00:09:09,766 --> 00:09:12,656
Why don't you try
calling me "Dad"?

126
00:09:57,781 --> 00:10:02,409
Animals were popping up
in the most unlikely places.

127
00:10:02,419 --> 00:10:04,177
Someone from work
said she saw a deer

128
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:06,992
in the cosmetics aisle at Target.

129
00:10:16,433 --> 00:10:18,728
You have an interview here?

130
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:26,203
I'm having a hard time
picturing you working here.

131
00:10:34,484 --> 00:10:36,509
I thought you said
the interview was at 3.

132
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,700
Good luck!

133
00:10:58,641 --> 00:11:02,008
After Mom left,
Charlie helped me

134
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,546
with my class projects.

135
00:11:04,647 --> 00:11:10,483
He did his best, but things
changed for me at school.

136
00:11:10,553 --> 00:11:13,913
He had his own ideas
about science and history.

137
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:16,149
When the teachers
disagreed with those ideas,

138
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:18,585
he always told them
they could look it up.

139
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:20,253
You think they're
going to like it?

140
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:21,855
They're going to love it.

141
00:11:21,865 --> 00:11:24,425
- Think so?
- I know so.

142
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:27,427
You have a good day,
sweetie.

143
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:29,437
- Okay.
- Okay.

144
00:11:29,873 --> 00:11:31,932
Good, very nice, Ron.

145
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:34,100
That's fine.

146
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,673
Who are the little people, Miranda?

147
00:11:40,683 --> 00:11:43,243
Those are the bodies
of the Chumash Indians

148
00:11:43,253 --> 00:11:45,745
who died of syphilis
and influenza,

149
00:11:45,755 --> 00:11:49,054
infected by the missionaries.

150
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,930
Uh, Miranda,
go out in the hallway

151
00:11:52,028 --> 00:11:54,189
and wait for me
out there.

152
00:11:54,264 --> 00:11:56,264
Go on.

153
00:12:00,203 --> 00:12:01,427
I don't understand.

154
00:12:01,437 --> 00:12:03,863
We're not having
any interviews.

155
00:12:03,873 --> 00:12:06,068
We're not hiring now.

156
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:09,809
Okay, sorry.
Thanks.

157
00:12:09,913 --> 00:12:13,542
Proceed to route.

158
00:12:13,616 --> 00:12:17,814
- Left turn in two miles.
- Charlie!

159
00:12:17,921 --> 00:12:19,412
- Goodbye.
- Shit, Charlie...

160
00:12:19,422 --> 00:12:21,247
Hey, Miranda. Hi.

161
00:12:21,257 --> 00:12:22,448
Where did you go?

162
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:24,117
Just, you know,
walking around,

163
00:12:24,127 --> 00:12:25,752
checking
the neighborhood out.

164
00:12:25,762 --> 00:12:28,595
What about the job?

165
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:31,958
You know why people
like to eat in this place?

166
00:12:31,968 --> 00:12:34,630
Fear of the unknown.

167
00:12:34,737 --> 00:12:36,963
Nothing in there
surprises them.

168
00:12:36,973 --> 00:12:39,332
Why do you feel like
you have to make stuff up?

169
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:41,568
I mean, so you're not
looking for a job.

170
00:12:41,578 --> 00:12:43,503
You just want to go,
I don't know,

171
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:44,904
explore or something.

172
00:12:44,914 --> 00:12:46,272
That's fine, whatever.

173
00:12:46,282 --> 00:12:48,508
I mean, it would be great
if you got a job.

174
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:50,343
I was barely scraping by
when it was just me...

175
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:51,511
Pull over there.

176
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:53,279
You have arrived.

177
00:12:53,289 --> 00:12:55,748
You know what, no.
I just wasted half my afternoon.

178
00:12:55,758 --> 00:12:56,916
Please, just pull in right over there.

179
00:12:56,926 --> 00:13:00,019
No, I'm not letting you
out of this car.

180
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,421
Miranda, I gotta go.

181
00:13:01,431 --> 00:13:03,590
What are you talking about?
What is this all about?

182
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,258
- Just tell me what you're doing.
- It's embarrassing, okay?

183
00:13:05,268 --> 00:13:10,283
I take these medications.
I gotta do pit stops all the time.

184
00:13:10,506 --> 00:13:12,506
Yeah. I'm sorry.

185
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,530
Can you back up to the bushes?

186
00:13:30,793 --> 00:13:37,253
When possible, make the first
available legal U-turn.

187
00:14:09,232 --> 00:14:11,232
Charlie?

188
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:24,833
Ow! Shit!

189
00:15:24,941 --> 00:15:27,842
Charlie? You okay?

190
00:15:27,944 --> 00:15:29,836
I'm fine.

191
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:31,771
Stop! Stop!

192
00:15:31,781 --> 00:15:33,139
God...

193
00:15:33,149 --> 00:15:36,008
What are you doing?
Do you have to do this right now?

194
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:38,144
The stars are
in a perfect position.

195
00:15:38,154 --> 00:15:41,554
They won't be like this
for another year.

196
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:44,398
I can't stop you, can I?

197
00:15:48,631 --> 00:15:51,498
Work your magic.

198
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:03,102
Oh, yeah, that's it,
the northerly declination

199
00:16:03,112 --> 00:16:04,370
from Sirius the Dog Star.

200
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,380
That's my baby!

201
00:16:18,795 --> 00:16:20,795
This is it.

202
00:16:20,863 --> 00:16:22,863
This is what?

203
00:16:24,801 --> 00:16:26,159
What're you doing?

204
00:16:26,169 --> 00:16:27,393
Come on, let's go.

205
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:29,403
Come on.

206
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:41,808
Oh, come on.

207
00:16:51,327 --> 00:16:53,553
Come on,
I'll give you a boost.

208
00:16:53,563 --> 00:16:55,563
Come here.

209
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:08,434
Just so you know,
I have to be at work

210
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:10,069
in, like, seven hours.

211
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,912
Relax.
You'll be there.

212
00:17:16,419 --> 00:17:18,419
Miranda...

213
00:17:18,521 --> 00:17:21,547
meet the Excalibur 1000.

214
00:17:23,526 --> 00:17:24,951
Is that a metal detector?

215
00:17:34,537 --> 00:17:35,895
Now you hear that?

216
00:17:35,905 --> 00:17:38,897
That's maybe tin foil or nickel.

217
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:42,433
Nickels and tin foil
make that low tone.

218
00:17:42,545 --> 00:17:46,811
We call that the fool's gold
of modern prospecting.

219
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:48,040
Prospecting?

220
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:49,809
Yeah.

221
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:55,487
High tone,
could be silver.

222
00:17:55,591 --> 00:17:57,971
Silver is a great conductor.

223
00:18:05,268 --> 00:18:08,066
Must be one
of the old quarters.

224
00:18:08,137 --> 00:18:12,302
The new ones,
they don't have much silver in them.

225
00:18:12,575 --> 00:18:14,967
We are well on our way
to paying off the Visa.

226
00:18:18,981 --> 00:18:20,172
You know, Charlie,
the manual says

227
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,774
you can plug headphones
into that thing,

228
00:18:21,784 --> 00:18:23,943
so why don't you do that
so that we don't get popped?

229
00:18:23,953 --> 00:18:26,279
No, then you wouldn't
get to hear it

230
00:18:26,289 --> 00:18:27,346
when it makes a noise.

231
00:18:31,661 --> 00:18:33,661
Huh!

232
00:18:38,601 --> 00:18:40,026
Get the shovel!

233
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:41,928
- We have a shovel?
- It's in the bag!

234
00:18:41,938 --> 00:18:44,864
I'm am out of here.
We're going to get busted.

235
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:46,532
We're not doing
anything illegal.

236
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:47,767
This is public land.

237
00:18:47,777 --> 00:18:49,101
There's gotta be
something illegal about...

238
00:18:49,111 --> 00:18:50,770
You are so lame,
Miranda.

239
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:53,105
I can't believe I raised
such a law-abiding citizen.

240
00:18:53,115 --> 00:18:54,640
Oh, you raised me?

241
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:58,177
Of course,
the highest tone

242
00:18:58,287 --> 00:19:01,688
is for the best conductor of them all.

243
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,980
Eureka.

244
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:32,878
Can we go now?

245
00:19:32,888 --> 00:19:37,086
Don't you want to
even know what this is?

246
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,590
Okay.

247
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,258
What is it?

248
00:19:43,366 --> 00:19:46,665
This is a doubloon.

249
00:19:46,736 --> 00:19:47,893
A what?

250
00:19:47,903 --> 00:19:52,670
A doubloon
from the 17th century.

251
00:19:57,079 --> 00:20:00,845
The diary of Father
Juan Florismartes Torres,

252
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:03,908
1651.

253
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:08,855
So, I picked up this book
in the hospital library

254
00:20:08,924 --> 00:20:10,416
and it got me thinking.

255
00:20:10,426 --> 00:20:12,251
I thought the whole idea
behind the hospital

256
00:20:12,261 --> 00:20:14,120
was for you
to stop thinking.

257
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:16,022
And I got some other books.

258
00:20:16,032 --> 00:20:18,193
More books, eh?

259
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:24,872
Along with a gold crucifix
and the statue of the Virgin,

260
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:30,606
Father Torres' expedition
had a cache of gold doubloons.

261
00:20:30,713 --> 00:20:35,446
Now, these doubloons were dated.

262
00:20:37,286 --> 00:20:41,086
This one...
it's hard to see.

263
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:44,615
Something...
Something, 1624.

264
00:20:44,727 --> 00:20:46,727
Let me see.

265
00:20:48,964 --> 00:20:51,296
That's 24 carats.

266
00:20:57,573 --> 00:21:00,833
Records that I obtained from
the Spanish Treasury indicate...

267
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:02,101
Okay. Wait, wait, wait.

268
00:21:02,111 --> 00:21:04,270
How the hell
did you obtain records

269
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,605
from the Spanish Treasury
from a mental institution?

270
00:21:06,615 --> 00:21:07,673
The internet.

271
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:09,775
- Perfect.
- No, I'll show you.

272
00:21:09,785 --> 00:21:11,785
Here.

273
00:21:19,662 --> 00:21:21,520
See for yourself.

274
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:24,966
Father Torres' doubloons
were dated.

275
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:28,663
Now, coins minted in 1624
were allocated

276
00:21:28,771 --> 00:21:30,796
for what we call now,
you know, "petty cash,"

277
00:21:30,806 --> 00:21:32,931
which Torres lost sooner.

278
00:21:32,975 --> 00:21:36,135
Nobody else was around back then,
so it's gotta be his.

279
00:21:36,145 --> 00:21:38,003
Now based upon
where we found this

280
00:21:38,013 --> 00:21:40,139
and the reports of
the underground cave system...

281
00:21:40,149 --> 00:21:42,041
- Cave system?
- Right. Right.

282
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:43,876
So all we gotta do
is follow this journal

283
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:47,371
and it's going to lead us
to the treasure.

284
00:21:48,457 --> 00:21:51,517
It's just...
It's waiting to be found.

285
00:21:52,795 --> 00:21:55,355
You're serious.

286
00:21:55,464 --> 00:21:56,789
Yeah.

287
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:59,291
Look, a lot of people
must've read this journal.

288
00:21:59,301 --> 00:22:00,893
How come nobody ever found
the treasure before?

289
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:03,295
They've tried!
I mean, lots of people have tried.

290
00:22:03,305 --> 00:22:05,231
It's been well documented,
all right?

291
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:06,398
I've read all of them.

292
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:08,868
- I marked chapters for you.
- Oh, Charlie.

293
00:22:08,878 --> 00:22:11,704
The thing is that nobody realized how special

294
00:22:11,714 --> 00:22:13,139
this Father Torres was.

295
00:22:13,149 --> 00:22:17,144
Nobody ever went and looked
into his background!

296
00:22:17,987 --> 00:22:21,582
Charlie, these people
all look like idiots.

297
00:22:28,364 --> 00:22:29,588
I'm going to go to bed.

298
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:32,024
- Miranda...
- You're freaking me out.

299
00:22:32,034 --> 00:22:34,034
Okay?

300
00:22:48,017 --> 00:22:49,441
I'm not decent.

301
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:51,576
Come on, Miranda.
Open up.

302
00:22:57,259 --> 00:23:00,753
Sometimes I wake up and...
and I don't know if I'm me.

303
00:23:00,763 --> 00:23:02,955
That's why you take
your medication.

304
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:04,723
No, it's not that.
I'm me. I know that.

305
00:23:04,733 --> 00:23:09,136
What I'm saying is that...
I don't know if I exist.

306
00:23:09,238 --> 00:23:11,096
Come on, listen...

307
00:23:11,106 --> 00:23:13,065
No, I... I'm listening.
You're not sure you exist.

308
00:23:13,075 --> 00:23:14,934
- And?
- I've done a lot of things in my life.

309
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:17,136
But maybe I haven't
done what I need to do.

310
00:23:17,146 --> 00:23:21,640
And if I do this,
maybe I will.

311
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:23,142
Exist?

312
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:25,152
Yeah.

313
00:23:26,555 --> 00:23:29,615
You're shaking.
You need something to eat.

314
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:31,650
Read the book.

315
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,085
This is so stupid.

316
00:23:33,095 --> 00:23:35,095
Please?

317
00:23:38,267 --> 00:23:42,007
All right, I'll read it
if you eat something.

318
00:23:49,478 --> 00:23:51,478
This is for you.

319
00:24:04,126 --> 00:24:07,653
Parents have this advantage over us.

320
00:24:07,663 --> 00:24:10,188
We want to believe in them.

321
00:24:10,299 --> 00:24:12,591
And when we don't
believe in them,

322
00:24:12,601 --> 00:24:15,491
we still just want
to be with them.

323
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:33,812
Hey, Padre!

324
00:24:33,822 --> 00:24:34,947
As a young man,

325
00:24:34,957 --> 00:24:37,283
Torres was a mathematics scholar in Seville.

326
00:24:38,961 --> 00:24:41,553
In fact, it looks like he might've
been sent to the New World

327
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:44,623
because certain of his ideas
were considered heretical.

328
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:51,630
But that's not
what's important.

329
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,300
The thing that matters here
is that he was more accustomed

330
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:58,076
to communicating
with numbers than words.

331
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:00,072
So then, it dawned
on me one night,

332
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:02,241
while the other patients
were watching JAG.

333
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:03,642
They like that in there?

334
00:25:03,652 --> 00:25:05,377
They love it.

335
00:25:05,387 --> 00:25:08,380
Anyway, I noticed that some
of the passages repeated themselves.

336
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:10,549
I read the book again,
and sure enough they did.

337
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:13,919
So I began to wonder, why would
somebody in the middle of nowhere

338
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:16,922
presumably with a limited
supply of pen and ink

339
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,424
repeat themselves like that?

340
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:20,092
Senility?

341
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:22,866
He was writing in code.

342
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:26,593
Took me a long time,
but I finally broke it.

343
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:31,611
I gotta go.

344
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:03,268
See, I transposed
Padre Torres' description

345
00:26:03,278 --> 00:26:05,938
and found the area he was
in was exactly seven leagues

346
00:26:05,948 --> 00:26:07,606
to the north of where
he said he was.

347
00:26:07,616 --> 00:26:09,616
It's simple, really.

348
00:26:29,271 --> 00:26:31,797
Charlie believed
the doubloon had been dropped

349
00:26:31,807 --> 00:26:33,799
when Father Torres'
expedition was robbed

350
00:26:33,809 --> 00:26:36,335
and half of his party
was massacred.

351
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:39,004
He thought that Torres
had headed northwest after that,

352
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:42,499
and that we were following
the same route.

353
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:47,579
"Journal of Father
Juan Florismartes Torres,

354
00:26:47,589 --> 00:26:53,084
"18th of October,
the year of our Lord 1624.

355
00:26:53,162 --> 00:26:57,356
"As we reached the summit and look
down into the valley of Santa Clarita,

356
00:26:57,366 --> 00:26:59,958
"there unfolded before us
was as beautiful a picture

357
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:02,596
"as one ever looked upon.

358
00:27:02,671 --> 00:27:06,932
"We saw a large green meadow
of thousands of acres, more or less,

359
00:27:06,942 --> 00:27:09,501
"its north side bounded
by low mountains at the base

360
00:27:09,511 --> 00:27:12,503
"which oak trees
were plentiful.

361
00:27:12,614 --> 00:27:15,140
"It was like a grand old park,

362
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:18,347
"such as we read of
in fairy tales.

363
00:27:18,454 --> 00:27:20,712
"We passed that night
under some large trees

364
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:22,181
"whose branches
went over our heads

365
00:27:22,191 --> 00:27:23,682
"as beautifully
as the ceilings

366
00:27:23,692 --> 00:27:26,684
"in our finest cathedrals.

367
00:27:26,795 --> 00:27:30,289
"Upon our safe arrival, we offered
the sacrament on a large rock

368
00:27:30,299 --> 00:27:34,126
"that seemed almost to have
been fashioned for that holy purpose.

369
00:27:34,136 --> 00:27:35,794
"I bade the smith
use his chisel

370
00:27:35,804 --> 00:27:40,394
"to carve the three crosses
of Golgotha into the stone.

371
00:27:43,979 --> 00:27:48,574
You have arrived
at your destination.

372
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:50,542
This is it.

373
00:27:50,552 --> 00:27:52,411
- It might be.
- No, it is! It is!

374
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:54,886
Look how old these trees are.

375
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:58,650
All right.

376
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:01,186
So obviously, it's going
to be worn down, right?

377
00:28:01,196 --> 00:28:04,523
I mean, you know,
it's more than 300 years old.

378
00:28:06,401 --> 00:28:08,401
Damn!

379
00:28:09,204 --> 00:28:10,596
Come here, come here.

380
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:12,606
- See this?
- What?

381
00:28:12,674 --> 00:28:14,600
This is it.

382
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:15,834
Look at that.

383
00:28:15,844 --> 00:28:17,603
Look! Look!

384
00:28:19,248 --> 00:28:20,339
I don't know.
It might be.

385
00:28:20,349 --> 00:28:22,349
It is!
That's it!

386
00:28:22,384 --> 00:28:25,114
The rock must've moved.

387
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,855
Well, it could be
an earthquake.

388
00:28:32,261 --> 00:28:34,286
Wait a minute.

389
00:28:34,396 --> 00:28:35,454
Wait a minute.
Look!

390
00:28:35,464 --> 00:28:37,689
I think I see it, right there!

391
00:28:37,699 --> 00:28:39,091
I see it. Look!
Yeah, they're upside-down.

392
00:28:39,101 --> 00:28:40,893
That's why I didn't
recognize them at first.

393
00:28:42,271 --> 00:28:44,271
Can I help you?

394
00:28:45,307 --> 00:28:46,765
I think it's time to go.

395
00:28:46,775 --> 00:28:48,433
Why do they always say,
"Can I help you?"

396
00:28:48,443 --> 00:28:50,102
when it's the last thing
they want to do?

397
00:28:50,112 --> 00:28:51,203
Sir?

398
00:28:51,213 --> 00:28:52,271
And they say "sir"
and "ma'am"

399
00:28:52,281 --> 00:28:53,739
like they want
to show some respect.

400
00:28:53,749 --> 00:28:54,940
- It's monstrous.
- Charlie.

401
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:56,375
- Sir!
- Yes.

402
00:28:56,385 --> 00:28:59,144
Are you a member
here at La Cresta?

403
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,581
Are you shitting me?

404
00:29:02,591 --> 00:29:04,383
Then I'll have to
ask you to leave.

405
00:29:04,393 --> 00:29:06,393
- Are you happy?
- Sir?

406
00:29:06,428 --> 00:29:08,787
- Charlie.
- All I want to know is are you happy?

407
00:29:08,797 --> 00:29:09,888
Sir.

408
00:29:09,898 --> 00:29:11,823
- Is this man your father?
- Yeah.

409
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:15,667
Just wanted to see
your eyes.

410
00:29:15,771 --> 00:29:18,831
I couldn't tell
what color they were.

411
00:29:18,907 --> 00:29:21,099
A first, I thought
they were brown.

412
00:29:21,109 --> 00:29:24,806
Now they're looking
very green.

413
00:29:24,913 --> 00:29:27,575
Must be the foliage.

414
00:29:27,649 --> 00:29:30,618
They are so beautiful.

415
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:35,689
They're hazel.

416
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:39,192
Hazel.

417
00:29:42,798 --> 00:29:47,531
Well, I'm so sorry that I
caused you any problems.

418
00:29:48,704 --> 00:29:51,867
But... I'll be on my way.

419
00:29:57,446 --> 00:29:59,438
I can't believe you just gave
that cop our phone number.

420
00:29:59,448 --> 00:30:01,540
I hope she calls me.
She's a peach.

421
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:02,874
Once you get
that flack vest off,

422
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:03,976
she'd be something else.

423
00:30:03,986 --> 00:30:06,352
Oh, God.

424
00:30:09,324 --> 00:30:11,550
Let's just say this gold does exist.

425
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,785
What are you going to do
with it after you get it?

426
00:30:13,795 --> 00:30:15,787
Wouldn't we have to give it
to a museum or something?

427
00:30:15,797 --> 00:30:17,456
Not necessarily.

428
00:30:17,466 --> 00:30:20,492
I know a lot of people who want
to buy it if we wanted to sell it,

429
00:30:20,502 --> 00:30:22,628
but you're missing the point.

430
00:30:22,638 --> 00:30:23,695
What's that?

431
00:30:23,705 --> 00:30:25,530
I don't want the money.

432
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:28,567
That's easy for you to say.
You don't have to work for it.

433
00:30:28,577 --> 00:30:31,171
Well, define work.

434
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:10,742
People walk around all day,

435
00:31:10,752 --> 00:31:13,011
sure that they're going
to win the lottery.

436
00:31:13,021 --> 00:31:15,414
I've always thought
that was crazy.

437
00:31:15,424 --> 00:31:17,517
Ten more minutes, Randy.

438
00:31:17,592 --> 00:31:19,751
My name is Miranda.

439
00:31:19,761 --> 00:31:23,288
At least Charlie had a plan.

440
00:31:23,398 --> 00:31:27,626
I mean, who doesn't
want to believe in buried treasure?

441
00:31:42,951 --> 00:31:46,978
Still, maybe I shouldn't
have encouraged him.

442
00:32:18,587 --> 00:32:20,846
"From the journal
of Father Torres,

443
00:32:20,856 --> 00:32:24,519
"November 21 st, 1624.

444
00:32:24,626 --> 00:32:27,786
"The natives appear to be
a simple, good-natured,

445
00:32:27,796 --> 00:32:29,755
"stupid race of people,

446
00:32:29,765 --> 00:32:32,524
"and in most respects
resemble the savages we find

447
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:35,494
"in other newly-discovered countries.

448
00:32:35,504 --> 00:32:38,196
"There was no sign
of aggression at first,

449
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:40,499
"until one of the soldiers
who'd come into our mission

450
00:32:40,509 --> 00:32:42,367
"was inspired to the act
of seduction,

451
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:45,505
"the object being
a young female.

452
00:32:45,614 --> 00:32:47,038
"An action
unfathomable to me

453
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:51,176
"as the females are uniformly
unpleasant of aspect.

454
00:32:51,186 --> 00:32:53,345
"Considerable uproar ensued
and we were forced

455
00:32:53,355 --> 00:32:57,435
to retreat inland,
following the river upstream."

456
00:33:00,362 --> 00:33:02,721
After they carved
the crosses on the rock,

457
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:04,456
Father Torres' expedition
had followed

458
00:33:04,466 --> 00:33:06,358
the Santa Clarita River.

459
00:33:06,368 --> 00:33:10,495
The thing was there wasn't
a Santa Clarita River anymore.

460
00:33:10,505 --> 00:33:12,964
It had been dammed
and diverted.

461
00:33:12,974 --> 00:33:14,900
But Charlie thought
that his calculations

462
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:18,003
would lead us to where
the river used to flow.

463
00:33:18,013 --> 00:33:22,093
He said I can look it up
if I didn't believe him.

464
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:27,220
What do I say?

465
00:33:30,392 --> 00:33:32,017
You don't have to say anything.

466
00:33:32,027 --> 00:33:34,928
We've got every right
to be here.

467
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:37,225
Thanks for the tip!

468
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,763
You got a 302 in there?

469
00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:46,331
What?

470
00:33:46,341 --> 00:33:47,933
Does that have a 302 in it?

471
00:33:47,943 --> 00:33:49,201
What?

472
00:33:49,211 --> 00:33:50,268
The backhoe.

473
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:53,111
Oh, that.
Yeah, yeah.

474
00:33:53,215 --> 00:33:56,741
It's a power plant,
that 302, for its size.

475
00:33:56,751 --> 00:33:58,751
It sure is.

476
00:34:02,557 --> 00:34:03,915
Ha ha!

477
00:34:03,925 --> 00:34:06,291
Ah! Jesus Christ!

478
00:34:06,394 --> 00:34:08,286
Pottery shards!
Ha ha!

479
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:11,089
Will you excuse me?
I'll catch you later.

480
00:34:11,099 --> 00:34:13,099
Right on.

481
00:34:16,905 --> 00:34:18,263
Broken water jugs,

482
00:34:18,273 --> 00:34:20,765
exactly the same kind
the expedition would've used!

483
00:34:20,775 --> 00:34:23,034
And look, it's even got
curved sides.

484
00:34:23,044 --> 00:34:24,803
Okay, well, shouldn't
we take them to somebody

485
00:34:24,813 --> 00:34:26,104
like an archaeologist
or something?

486
00:34:26,114 --> 00:34:27,873
What, have them
spoil everything?

487
00:34:27,883 --> 00:34:30,242
No, they can do that...
that thing, that radio...

488
00:34:30,252 --> 00:34:31,276
- Radio carbon dating, yeah.
- Yeah.

489
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:34,746
That's been discredited
a long time ago.

490
00:34:34,756 --> 00:34:37,916
"In questions of science
the analysis of a thousand

491
00:34:37,926 --> 00:34:41,586
is not worth the humble reasoning
of a single individual!"

492
00:34:41,596 --> 00:34:43,596
Galileo!

493
00:34:44,232 --> 00:34:47,633
Miranda, just feel this.

494
00:34:47,736 --> 00:34:50,136
Put that in your hands.

495
00:34:50,238 --> 00:34:52,672
Feel how old that is.

496
00:34:57,279 --> 00:34:58,770
Charlie believed
that if we followed

497
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:01,339
the original riverbed,
we would locate the cavern

498
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:02,574
where Father Torres
and his men

499
00:35:02,584 --> 00:35:05,747
had been forced
to abandon their gold.

500
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:08,482
But there was one obstacle.

501
00:35:17,465 --> 00:35:20,025
49.2 degrees north.

502
00:35:20,135 --> 00:35:22,160
This is the way.

503
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:24,596
Hi. Uh, do you have
your card?

504
00:35:24,606 --> 00:35:26,646
Oh, we're just browsing.

505
00:35:32,948 --> 00:35:34,940
What I need you to do...

506
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:39,478
I want you to take
this out 67 feet.

507
00:35:41,022 --> 00:35:43,022
Please?

508
00:36:03,345 --> 00:36:05,170
Don't touch that!

509
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:07,648
Don't...
Oh, Jesus Christ.

510
00:36:07,716 --> 00:36:08,907
I'm so close.

511
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:11,078
- Excuse me, sir.
- What?

512
00:36:11,186 --> 00:36:13,578
Pardon me, but I didn't know
we really carried these.

513
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:16,081
These? You guys
got everything in here.

514
00:36:16,091 --> 00:36:18,483
Yeah, we sure do.
Is it working out for you?

515
00:36:18,493 --> 00:36:20,852
- It's working out fine. It's fine.
- Okay.

516
00:36:20,862 --> 00:36:23,990
All right, well...
Okay. All right.

517
00:36:33,341 --> 00:36:35,166
Okay.

518
00:36:35,176 --> 00:36:36,401
All right.

519
00:36:36,411 --> 00:36:39,209
I'll just get this...

520
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,373
Okay.

521
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:43,659
Can you hold this, please?

522
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,045
This is plugged.

523
00:36:47,055 --> 00:36:48,747
This over here.

524
00:36:48,757 --> 00:36:50,850
24 degrees.

525
00:36:50,925 --> 00:36:52,925
And that's it.

526
00:37:00,702 --> 00:37:02,702
X marks the spot.

527
00:37:04,606 --> 00:37:06,264
This is so wild.

528
00:37:06,274 --> 00:37:08,566
Doubloons from
the King of Spain,

529
00:37:08,576 --> 00:37:09,968
lost more than
300 years ago

530
00:37:09,978 --> 00:37:12,783
and they're buried
under a Costco?

531
00:37:12,814 --> 00:37:16,274
Well, I guess you know
it wasn't meant to be.

532
00:37:16,284 --> 00:37:18,284
It's only 6 feet down.

533
00:37:19,587 --> 00:37:21,212
Only 6 feet?

534
00:37:21,222 --> 00:37:22,647
Maybe 7.

535
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:24,916
It'll take two
highly-motivated individuals

536
00:37:24,926 --> 00:37:26,451
maybe fours hours
with the right equipment.

537
00:37:26,461 --> 00:37:29,089
Are you nuts?

538
00:37:29,164 --> 00:37:31,956
I'm sorry, but can we be realistic here?

539
00:37:31,966 --> 00:37:33,591
I'm being realistic.
There's no problem here.

540
00:37:33,601 --> 00:37:36,127
- I'll lay it out.
- No, forget it, Charlie.

541
00:37:36,137 --> 00:37:37,495
No way.

542
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:39,164
- You did your best.
- No, no, no, no!

543
00:37:39,174 --> 00:37:42,333
I'm not going to be beaten
by a few layers of concrete!

544
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:44,235
No, sir!
Not on my watch!

545
00:37:44,245 --> 00:37:46,338
Hey, take it easy.

546
00:38:39,234 --> 00:38:42,060
Mom was a hand model,

547
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:46,564
a job held by adult women
with eerily childlike hands.

548
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:48,399
Which you don't
come across every day,

549
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:50,135
so they get paid pretty well.

550
00:38:50,145 --> 00:38:52,570
Cut. Great.
That's a wrap.

551
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,706
She was careful.

552
00:38:54,716 --> 00:38:56,374
She had to be.

553
00:38:56,384 --> 00:38:59,144
Her hands were the only income
we had for a while.

554
00:38:59,154 --> 00:39:02,384
Don't you touch my hands!

555
00:39:04,893 --> 00:39:10,163
After she left, it was just me and Charlie.

556
00:39:10,565 --> 00:39:13,625
Things were a lot more
exciting then.

557
00:39:15,203 --> 00:39:17,203
Like an adventure.

558
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:21,827
But the supply of toys dwindled.

559
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:25,945
We managed, though.

560
00:39:38,693 --> 00:39:43,963
I don't know why anybody would
want to buy one of these things.

561
00:39:44,365 --> 00:39:48,927
It's not as if it's so hard
to wash dishes by hand

562
00:39:49,037 --> 00:39:51,267
the old-fashioned way.

563
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:25,338
Ooh!

564
00:40:40,088 --> 00:40:42,088
Morning.

565
00:40:42,357 --> 00:40:44,357
You...

566
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,360
Uh, Miranda?

567
00:41:01,843 --> 00:41:03,034
What happened to my car?

568
00:41:03,044 --> 00:41:04,369
Miranda...

569
00:41:04,379 --> 00:41:06,379
Did you wreck it?

570
00:41:07,615 --> 00:41:09,674
I couldn't pay the rental
on the backhoe.

571
00:41:09,684 --> 00:41:10,775
No way.

572
00:41:10,785 --> 00:41:13,611
So, your car
was a necessary sacrifice.

573
00:41:13,621 --> 00:41:15,613
But we're almost there,
Miranda.

574
00:41:15,623 --> 00:41:17,448
We are so close.

575
00:41:17,458 --> 00:41:19,517
Jesus Christ.

576
00:41:21,629 --> 00:41:23,859
I'm sorry, I...

577
00:41:23,965 --> 00:41:26,858
I'm really sorry.
I just wasn't thinking.

578
00:41:26,868 --> 00:41:28,026
You never do.

579
00:41:28,036 --> 00:41:30,197
Well, I'll get it back.

580
00:41:30,305 --> 00:41:32,497
- How are you going to do that?
- I don't know.

581
00:41:32,507 --> 00:41:33,564
But I will.

582
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:35,199
Well, I guess I'd better
get a move on

583
00:41:35,209 --> 00:41:37,035
since I'm going
to have to take the bus.

584
00:41:37,045 --> 00:41:38,903
Can't you get a friend
to give you a ride?

585
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:41,746
I don't have any friends.

586
00:41:41,849 --> 00:41:45,710
What about that skinny one
who only eats carrots?

587
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,045
Carrots-and-Mountain Dew-Julia?

588
00:41:47,055 --> 00:41:48,646
Right, Julia,
carrots, right.

589
00:41:48,656 --> 00:41:49,747
She had an eating disorder.

590
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:52,483
She went to the hospital
and died.

591
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:56,721
Well, in that case, maybe I can
go back down and get the car.

592
00:41:56,731 --> 00:41:57,922
I'm sure he hasn't
sold it yet.

593
00:41:57,932 --> 00:41:59,991
It wasn't that the car
was in such great shape.

594
00:42:00,001 --> 00:42:02,327
- I'm sure the car...
- Stop! Stop!

595
00:42:02,337 --> 00:42:03,828
I loved that car.

596
00:42:03,838 --> 00:42:05,596
I know you did.

597
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:07,432
No, you didn't
because I never told you.

598
00:42:07,442 --> 00:42:08,900
Why? Because you never listen.

599
00:42:08,910 --> 00:42:11,836
All right, I'm an asshole.
That has been established.

600
00:42:11,846 --> 00:42:15,273
Not to the extent that
I'm about to establish it.

601
00:42:15,283 --> 00:42:18,276
You make fun of everything
I do, including my job.

602
00:42:18,286 --> 00:42:19,911
No, I'm proud of you working.

603
00:42:19,921 --> 00:42:21,179
Don't... Yeah, right.

604
00:42:21,189 --> 00:42:22,880
You know, I'm the one
that's paying the bills.

605
00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:25,415
No, it's wild.
Isn't it?

606
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:28,920
You don't take anything seriously, do you?

607
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:31,856
You think the world
is just here for your amusement.

608
00:42:31,866 --> 00:42:34,058
- Look at the world.
- I do.

609
00:42:34,068 --> 00:42:37,028
But unlike you,
I have to live in it.

610
00:42:37,038 --> 00:42:39,871
I just...
I don't understand.

611
00:42:39,941 --> 00:42:41,399
You're a really smart guy.

612
00:42:41,409 --> 00:42:44,802
How can you keep
doing this year after year?

613
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:47,542
What do you mean?

614
00:42:47,615 --> 00:42:51,142
The treasure is just like
all your jazz combos, Charlie.

615
00:42:51,152 --> 00:42:53,277
Just like the tour boat
that sank,

616
00:42:53,287 --> 00:42:56,381
just like the Mexican
holistic medical degree,

617
00:42:56,391 --> 00:42:58,655
just like your marriage.

618
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,718
How come you can't
see that?

619
00:43:00,728 --> 00:43:04,129
Everybody else can.

620
00:43:04,232 --> 00:43:07,547
There's something
really wrong with you.

621
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:18,302
I can't believe
you sold my fucking car!

622
00:43:18,312 --> 00:43:19,604
And now...

623
00:43:21,282 --> 00:43:26,185
And now, I give you
Orange Grove Estates' 1,000th family.

624
00:43:26,287 --> 00:43:28,287
Let's give them a hand.

625
00:45:16,364 --> 00:45:18,360
Welcome to McDonald's.

626
00:45:41,656 --> 00:45:42,813
Have a good day, sweetie

627
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:44,823
- Okay.
- Okay.

628
00:47:00,568 --> 00:47:04,829
After he found his bass again
in that pawn shop in Atlanta,

629
00:47:04,839 --> 00:47:09,742
Charlie swore
he'd never pawn it again.

630
00:47:09,844 --> 00:47:11,669
He swore he'd pawn
his own mother

631
00:47:11,679 --> 00:47:13,977
before he'd pawn that bass.

632
00:47:48,215 --> 00:47:51,844
Charlie.

633
00:47:51,919 --> 00:47:54,547
Charlie.

634
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:11,095
Have you eaten anything?

635
00:48:14,108 --> 00:48:15,700
No.

636
00:48:15,710 --> 00:48:20,271
- I'll go make something.
- Oh, no, it's cool. It's cool.

637
00:48:20,281 --> 00:48:22,281
Why don't you sit down?

638
00:48:26,554 --> 00:48:29,887
Used to look out here,
you'd see one,

639
00:48:29,957 --> 00:48:32,790
maybe two lights.

640
00:48:32,893 --> 00:48:37,830
Your mom, she used to complain
all the time about being

641
00:48:37,932 --> 00:48:40,057
in the middle of nowhere.

642
00:48:43,471 --> 00:48:44,929
It's still the middle of nowhere.

643
00:48:44,939 --> 00:48:49,433
There's just a lot more people in it now.

644
00:48:55,116 --> 00:48:58,941
You didn't have to sell
your bass and records.

645
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:03,147
You just have to know
when to give up.

646
00:49:03,257 --> 00:49:05,657
Dad, don't.

647
00:49:08,696 --> 00:49:11,995
I told you,
I'm finished with music.

648
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:18,174
That's not what
I'm talking about.

649
00:49:29,784 --> 00:49:31,509
Um, excuse me.

650
00:49:31,519 --> 00:49:33,851
- Hi.
- Hi.

651
00:49:33,954 --> 00:49:36,844
Would you like to try
some chowder?

652
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:41,020
So let's hear it.

653
00:49:41,128 --> 00:49:42,720
Okay, well, a lot of the doors

654
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:45,689
claim to be alarmed
but they're not.

655
00:49:45,699 --> 00:49:47,860
How do you know?

656
00:49:47,968 --> 00:49:49,627
I opened them.

657
00:49:49,637 --> 00:49:50,861
Well, that's fine.

658
00:49:50,871 --> 00:49:54,356
We'll make a good scofflaw
out of you yet.

659
00:50:09,657 --> 00:50:13,397
Most of the people are really nice.

660
00:50:14,028 --> 00:50:15,753
Everyone says I could be looking at a raise

661
00:50:15,763 --> 00:50:17,721
within six months,
and the benefits are great.

662
00:50:17,731 --> 00:50:19,757
Hold on, here. Let's focus.

663
00:50:19,767 --> 00:50:21,892
Tell me about
the security guards.

664
00:50:21,902 --> 00:50:23,761
They have two of them.

665
00:50:23,771 --> 00:50:24,895
They only work in the daytime.

666
00:50:24,905 --> 00:50:26,230
Come on, come on!

667
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:28,365
One of them is named Mike.

668
00:50:28,375 --> 00:50:31,095
And the other one
is named Bruce.

669
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:33,875
Security guards
have master keys,

670
00:50:33,948 --> 00:50:36,240
but the manager,
he's the only one

671
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:38,742
who has the great
grand master key.

672
00:50:38,752 --> 00:50:41,380
It opens every single door.

673
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:42,913
He calls it the "God" key.

674
00:50:42,923 --> 00:50:44,748
I think you're doing great,
by the way.

675
00:50:44,758 --> 00:50:46,283
Thanks.

676
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:50,354
Kelly and I sometimes head
out to the beach on Saturdays.

677
00:50:50,364 --> 00:50:52,790
We have a little barbecue,
play a little volleyball.

678
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,758
Nah, you play volleyball.

679
00:50:54,768 --> 00:50:57,528
I just listen to Jimmy Buffet
and soak up the rays.

680
00:50:57,538 --> 00:51:00,029
I'm a total parrothead.

681
00:51:00,107 --> 00:51:02,657
Do you like the beach,
Miranda?

682
00:51:03,110 --> 00:51:05,269
I can't even remember
the last time I went to the beach.

683
00:51:05,279 --> 00:51:07,538
I bet you'd look great
in a bikini.

684
00:51:07,548 --> 00:51:09,106
Miranda.

685
00:51:09,116 --> 00:51:11,275
What? Let me finish the story.

686
00:51:11,285 --> 00:51:13,810
Did you...

687
00:51:13,921 --> 00:51:16,556
Did you get sort of
a weird vibe

688
00:51:16,624 --> 00:51:19,218
from these people?

689
00:51:19,293 --> 00:51:21,386
- Kind of.
- Yeah.

690
00:51:21,462 --> 00:51:23,787
That's because they're swingers.

691
00:51:23,797 --> 00:51:26,095
What?

692
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:28,259
Do I gotta draw you
a picture?

693
00:51:28,269 --> 00:51:30,499
What are you
talking about?

694
00:51:30,604 --> 00:51:32,496
- You don't know, do you?
- No.

695
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:36,840
So nice that you don't
know everything.

696
00:51:36,944 --> 00:51:39,344
Swingers, um...

697
00:51:39,446 --> 00:51:42,439
Well, they're, you know,
people who like

698
00:51:42,449 --> 00:51:46,359
to spice up their life
with different partners.

699
00:51:48,455 --> 00:51:50,787
Oh, my God.

700
00:51:50,858 --> 00:51:53,656
They were talking
swinger code.

701
00:51:53,761 --> 00:51:56,753
Oh, God,
that is so gross!

702
00:51:56,830 --> 00:51:58,122
What am I going to do?

703
00:51:58,132 --> 00:51:59,623
Why? Wh-What's the matter?

704
00:51:59,633 --> 00:52:02,526
- They invited me to a barbecue.
- They what?

705
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:04,962
You were the one that told me
to accept any and all invitations

706
00:52:04,972 --> 00:52:07,097
so that I can get to know
the people and the layout.

707
00:52:07,107 --> 00:52:09,099
But I didn't mean that
you were supposed to go and...

708
00:52:09,109 --> 00:52:10,768
I didn't know that
they were swingers.

709
00:52:10,778 --> 00:52:13,003
It's cool, all right?
It's cool, it's cool.

710
00:52:13,013 --> 00:52:15,172
You just...
You don't have to go.

711
00:52:15,182 --> 00:52:16,807
I told them that I would,
and, you know,

712
00:52:16,817 --> 00:52:18,609
I thought I could maybe
get at Doug's keys.

713
00:52:18,619 --> 00:52:20,144
The God key.

714
00:52:20,154 --> 00:52:22,714
- Yeah.
- Mm.

715
00:52:22,823 --> 00:52:24,949
No, no. We...
We can't do this.

716
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:27,618
I think I can take care of myself, Charlie;
I've had a lot of practice.

717
00:52:27,628 --> 00:52:31,288
You know, sometimes
I just wish you'd call me "Dad."

718
00:52:31,298 --> 00:52:33,490
Okay, I can take care
of myself, Dad.

719
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:36,527
Thank you. I mean, you're what,
18 years old now?

720
00:52:36,537 --> 00:52:38,537
I'll be 17 in 3 weeks.

721
00:52:40,007 --> 00:52:44,068
You're gonna be 17?
I gotta write this down, man.

722
00:52:44,078 --> 00:52:46,078
You are so young.

723
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:47,471
But, you know,
you act so old.

724
00:52:47,481 --> 00:52:48,539
Sometimes you're very, um...

725
00:52:48,549 --> 00:52:50,240
- Precocious?
- Precocious, yes.

726
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:53,177
Now, I forbid you
to go to this barbecue.

727
00:52:53,187 --> 00:52:54,812
You hear me?

728
00:52:54,822 --> 00:52:55,879
Okay, I won't.

729
00:52:55,889 --> 00:52:57,214
Are you going
to promise me that?

730
00:52:57,224 --> 00:52:59,224
Okay. God.

731
00:53:45,406 --> 00:53:48,732
One of the perks
of the management position:

732
00:53:48,742 --> 00:53:51,074
half price on all seafood.

733
00:53:51,145 --> 00:53:53,950
Have some before
it's all spoiled.

734
00:53:55,883 --> 00:53:57,441
It's a virgin,
by the way.

735
00:53:57,451 --> 00:53:59,451
Berry flavored.

736
00:54:01,422 --> 00:54:02,780
Miranda, did you bring
your bathing suit?

737
00:54:02,790 --> 00:54:05,884
No. Why?

738
00:54:05,959 --> 00:54:07,551
You don't have
a swimming pool, right?

739
00:54:07,561 --> 00:54:09,453
Hot tub.

740
00:54:10,631 --> 00:54:13,896
Dude! Dude!

741
00:54:13,967 --> 00:54:15,592
We need some more chairs!

742
00:54:15,602 --> 00:54:18,400
Okay, Leonid.
Just a sec.

743
00:54:18,472 --> 00:54:20,330
Excuse me, ladies.

744
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:23,233
Hey, so do you want to go
check out my suits?

745
00:54:23,243 --> 00:54:24,735
I've got a major selection.

746
00:54:24,745 --> 00:54:26,170
Huh?

747
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:28,772
I mean, we look
like we're about the same size, huh?

748
00:54:28,782 --> 00:54:30,841
Uh, I think I'm...

749
00:54:30,951 --> 00:54:33,477
I'm sorry, I think I'm going
to have to pass on the hot tub.

750
00:54:33,487 --> 00:54:35,112
Are you sure?

751
00:54:35,122 --> 00:54:36,947
It'd be really nice.

752
00:54:36,957 --> 00:54:39,762
That water's, like,
fruit scented.

753
00:54:39,793 --> 00:54:41,793
It's pineapple...

754
00:54:58,112 --> 00:55:00,471
Actually, I changed my mind.
The hot tub sounds good.

755
00:55:00,481 --> 00:55:04,281
It does, doesn't it?
All right, come on.

756
00:55:07,454 --> 00:55:11,356
So, I'm guessing
a G-string is out.

757
00:55:11,458 --> 00:55:13,117
What?

758
00:55:13,127 --> 00:55:16,120
Wait, I got the perfect thong.

759
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:22,567
- A thong?
- What? Oh, no, no.

760
00:55:22,669 --> 00:55:24,294
- Look at this.
- No, no, no.

761
00:55:24,304 --> 00:55:26,029
All right.

762
00:55:26,039 --> 00:55:28,039
I got it!

763
00:55:33,981 --> 00:55:36,142
Parrots?

764
00:55:36,216 --> 00:55:38,514
Check it out.
Look at that.

765
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:41,247
No? Okay.
One more.

766
00:55:45,492 --> 00:55:49,053
Okay, I hope you dig this.

767
00:55:49,163 --> 00:55:51,222
Dude!

768
00:55:51,331 --> 00:55:54,494
Check it out.
Look at this.

769
00:55:54,568 --> 00:55:58,163
Oh, hey, it's all right.

770
00:55:58,238 --> 00:56:00,866
Are you sure
this is a virgin?

771
00:56:02,176 --> 00:56:05,270
Oh, boy.

772
00:56:09,883 --> 00:56:12,283
You know, um,
there's this...

773
00:56:12,386 --> 00:56:13,877
Oh, Christ.

774
00:56:13,887 --> 00:56:16,097
- Oh, okay.
- I'm so sorry.

775
00:56:37,377 --> 00:56:39,377
- Hi.
- Hey.

776
00:56:39,446 --> 00:56:41,710
What's happening?

777
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:48,948
So, um... look
what I got for you.

778
00:56:49,056 --> 00:56:52,321
One with your own name on it.

779
00:56:52,426 --> 00:56:54,485
Good. Great.

780
00:56:54,595 --> 00:56:55,986
No.

781
00:56:55,996 --> 00:56:57,554
Come on, your credit rating is great.

782
00:56:57,564 --> 00:57:00,328
No, Charlie. No.

783
00:57:00,434 --> 00:57:02,392
You all right?

784
00:57:02,402 --> 00:57:04,402
Yeah, I'm fine.

785
00:57:04,438 --> 00:57:06,930
So, Pepper here,
he used to work

786
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:10,000
for an alarm service
company.

787
00:57:10,110 --> 00:57:12,135
Was that before or after
you went to jail?

788
00:57:12,145 --> 00:57:14,238
Before.

789
00:57:14,314 --> 00:57:19,775
And Pepper, he knows
how those alarm systems work.

790
00:57:23,590 --> 00:57:24,915
Wait, Charlie,
what did you tell him?

791
00:57:24,925 --> 00:57:25,983
What did he tell you?

792
00:58:10,304 --> 00:58:12,304
Charlie?

793
00:58:14,541 --> 00:58:16,541
Charlie!

794
00:58:20,347 --> 00:58:22,907
Is this what I think it is?

795
00:58:23,016 --> 00:58:26,586
Charlie, what did you do?
What is going on?

796
00:58:27,154 --> 00:58:29,146
Uh, I got behind
in the third mortgage.

797
00:58:29,156 --> 00:58:30,881
- I didn't even know there was a second.
- Well, sure.

798
00:58:30,891 --> 00:58:31,982
There's a third
to pay the second,

799
00:58:31,992 --> 00:58:33,417
a second to pay
the first, and so on.

800
00:58:33,427 --> 00:58:36,658
- How'd you get this?
- "And so on"?

801
00:58:36,730 --> 00:58:38,940
They're taking everything.

802
00:58:40,867 --> 00:58:44,997
Miranda, did you go
to that orgy?

803
00:58:45,072 --> 00:58:48,041
I... It was a barbecue.

804
00:58:51,545 --> 00:58:54,095
Are you sure nothing happened?

805
00:58:55,248 --> 00:58:57,441
Something happened, didn't it?

806
00:58:57,451 --> 00:59:00,877
The swingers, they
got to you, didn't they?

807
00:59:00,887 --> 00:59:02,546
Goddamnit!
What've I done?

808
00:59:02,556 --> 00:59:04,114
I'm supposed to be
your father, you know.

809
00:59:04,124 --> 00:59:06,249
And here I am, throwing you
right into the lion's den.

810
00:59:06,259 --> 00:59:08,218
You didn't.
It was my idea.

811
00:59:08,228 --> 00:59:10,228
Just tell me.

812
00:59:10,297 --> 00:59:11,755
When you went
to the bank,

813
00:59:11,765 --> 00:59:13,090
what was the reason
you gave them

814
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:14,725
for why we needed
the money?

815
00:59:14,735 --> 00:59:16,735
Home improvement.

816
00:59:16,770 --> 00:59:18,428
Okay.

817
00:59:18,438 --> 00:59:20,733
What about the second time?

818
00:59:21,274 --> 00:59:23,233
Swimming pool.

819
00:59:23,243 --> 00:59:24,301
Ah.

820
00:59:24,311 --> 00:59:26,903
You know,
but the timing's perfect.

821
00:59:26,913 --> 00:59:28,939
When is the timing ever good

822
00:59:28,949 --> 00:59:32,009
for getting kicked out
of your house?

823
00:59:32,052 --> 00:59:34,577
Think about it.

824
00:59:34,654 --> 00:59:36,713
Yeah.

825
00:59:36,790 --> 00:59:40,055
It's the Chinese thing.

826
00:59:40,127 --> 00:59:45,895
Catastrophe
equals opportunity.

827
00:59:45,966 --> 00:59:47,057
Excuse me.

828
00:59:47,067 --> 00:59:49,107
It's time for you to go.

829
00:59:51,772 --> 00:59:53,597
"From the journal of Father Torres,

830
00:59:53,607 --> 00:59:56,838
"November 30, 1624.

831
00:59:56,943 --> 00:59:59,102
"When the savages
were silent,

832
00:59:59,112 --> 01:00:02,606
"that was when the company
was most affrighted.

833
01:00:02,616 --> 01:00:04,007
"Evidently,
they were gathered

834
01:00:04,017 --> 01:00:05,442
"around the entrance
to the cavern,

835
01:00:05,452 --> 01:00:07,110
"awaiting such time
as our hunger

836
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:09,246
"might overwhelm good sense

837
01:00:09,256 --> 01:00:11,891
"and force us
out into the open.

838
01:00:14,995 --> 01:00:18,622
"Ofttimes perforce,
the officers were compelled

839
01:00:18,632 --> 01:00:20,290
"to use their muskets,

840
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:22,935
firing over
the natives' heads."

841
01:00:24,538 --> 01:00:27,803
I'm getting
really good vibes here.

842
01:00:29,810 --> 01:00:33,635
I can't believe we're doing this.

843
01:00:39,619 --> 01:00:41,678
- Where are you going?
- Running away. What does it look like?

844
01:00:41,688 --> 01:00:43,113
We gotta stick
with the plan.

845
01:00:43,123 --> 01:00:45,782
- Come on!
- We gotta get out of here...

846
01:00:45,792 --> 01:00:48,652
Oh, God! Oh, God!
Oh, God! Oh, God!

847
01:00:48,662 --> 01:00:50,662
It's over here!

848
01:01:01,975 --> 01:01:03,975
Up here!

849
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,921
Where's my glasses?

850
01:01:23,029 --> 01:01:25,395
On your head!

851
01:01:33,611 --> 01:01:35,607
It's done.

852
01:01:36,443 --> 01:01:37,767
Where's the propane?

853
01:01:37,777 --> 01:01:39,069
Over here!

854
01:01:45,285 --> 01:01:47,285
Right here!

855
01:02:06,273 --> 01:02:08,707
That ought to do it.

856
01:02:08,775 --> 01:02:09,866
Where are you going?

857
01:02:09,876 --> 01:02:12,709
Outside, remember?

858
01:02:21,955 --> 01:02:23,046
I...

859
01:02:23,056 --> 01:02:25,056
What are you doing?

860
01:02:32,499 --> 01:02:34,958
You really sure
this is going to work?

861
01:02:34,968 --> 01:02:37,627
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No... No problems.

862
01:02:37,637 --> 01:02:41,300
Pepper, he fixed
the alarm box

863
01:02:41,408 --> 01:02:43,400
so it would read
like a gas leak.

864
01:02:43,410 --> 01:02:45,802
- And if that's the case we don't...
- Ahh!

865
01:02:55,422 --> 01:02:56,947
Panel says "gas leak."

866
01:02:56,957 --> 01:02:58,957
Smell anything?

867
01:02:59,025 --> 01:03:01,186
Yeah, I found it.

868
01:03:01,294 --> 01:03:03,294
Propane bottles leaked.

869
01:03:10,003 --> 01:03:12,003
Perfect.

870
01:03:16,776 --> 01:03:18,935
Shh, tat tat tat.

871
01:03:18,945 --> 01:03:22,938
I think we should
stay here for a bit.

872
01:03:33,793 --> 01:03:36,019
Breaking and entering
makes everything

873
01:03:36,029 --> 01:03:39,556
taste... different.

874
01:03:39,666 --> 01:03:42,999
Makes it taste,
um, livelier.

875
01:03:51,044 --> 01:03:56,175
In those days they would've
used pitch pine torches.

876
01:04:35,922 --> 01:04:39,949
It's got to be here
somewheres.

877
01:04:45,965 --> 01:04:47,257
Do you smell that?

878
01:04:47,267 --> 01:04:49,267
What?

879
01:04:53,139 --> 01:04:55,369
Ammonia.

880
01:04:55,442 --> 01:04:56,599
They must've cleaned
the floor.

881
01:04:56,609 --> 01:04:58,649
They cleaned your X off.

882
01:04:59,646 --> 01:05:02,080
That does it, then.

883
01:05:02,148 --> 01:05:04,610
Oh, no, I-I know
where to dig.

884
01:05:04,620 --> 01:05:08,986
No, it's...
it's right here.

885
01:05:09,089 --> 01:05:11,649
- Here?
- Yes.

886
01:05:11,758 --> 01:05:15,125
No, it's... it's...

887
01:05:16,596 --> 01:05:17,654
It's here.

888
01:05:17,664 --> 01:05:19,089
Charlie.

889
01:05:19,099 --> 01:05:21,224
Miranda, we're going
to dig here.

890
01:05:21,234 --> 01:05:23,566
Are you sure?

891
01:05:24,971 --> 01:05:28,626
Well, I... I guess I'd better be.

892
01:05:31,444 --> 01:05:33,069
You got the walkie talkie?

893
01:05:33,079 --> 01:05:34,170
Yeah.

894
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:36,220
Pepper, is it all clear?

895
01:05:37,951 --> 01:05:39,951
Yeah.

896
01:06:25,398 --> 01:06:26,523
Come in, Charlie.

897
01:06:26,533 --> 01:06:29,400
Charlie, come in.

898
01:06:43,483 --> 01:06:45,375
Evening, sir.

899
01:06:45,385 --> 01:06:47,410
What seems to be
the problem?

900
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:49,545
Motorcycle's not working?

901
01:06:50,824 --> 01:06:52,482
We hit rebar.

902
01:06:52,492 --> 01:06:55,467
Well, I think
I might've flooded it.

903
01:07:00,934 --> 01:07:02,859
There's the throttle
right there.

904
01:07:02,869 --> 01:07:04,869
I know. I know.

905
01:07:15,014 --> 01:07:17,014
Hey, let me try.

906
01:07:21,187 --> 01:07:23,553
Hey!

907
01:08:31,291 --> 01:08:33,691
Miranda.

908
01:08:33,793 --> 01:08:35,793
Hey.

909
01:08:45,772 --> 01:08:47,797
Don't step on that.

910
01:08:56,382 --> 01:08:58,382
Hello.

911
01:09:29,382 --> 01:09:31,646
What is that smell?

912
01:09:31,718 --> 01:09:34,978
You must've hit the sewer line.

913
01:09:34,988 --> 01:09:38,581
No, the sewer's all the way
on the other side of the store,

914
01:09:38,591 --> 01:09:40,591
under pet care.

915
01:09:44,831 --> 01:09:48,324
Current is stronger
than I thought it'd be.

916
01:09:48,334 --> 01:09:51,224
That looks a lot
like sewage to me.

917
01:09:53,740 --> 01:09:56,436
It's the underground river.

918
01:09:56,542 --> 01:09:59,772
Just like the journal
said it would be.

919
01:10:02,515 --> 01:10:04,240
Where are you going?

920
01:10:04,250 --> 01:10:06,009
Sir!

921
01:10:06,019 --> 01:10:09,682
Come on, sir,
you're just wasting gas.

922
01:10:21,801 --> 01:10:23,801
Pepper.

923
01:10:27,907 --> 01:10:31,477
Come in, Pepper.

924
01:10:32,478 --> 01:10:33,603
Charlie?

925
01:10:33,613 --> 01:10:36,939
This store is great.
It's got everything.

926
01:10:36,949 --> 01:10:38,608
What are you doing?

927
01:10:38,618 --> 01:10:40,443
That should
be long enough.

928
01:10:40,453 --> 01:10:45,390
The journal says the passageway's
about 40 barras.

929
01:10:45,458 --> 01:10:47,417
That's Spanish for "yards".

930
01:10:47,427 --> 01:10:49,619
So it should be
about 120 feet.

931
01:10:49,629 --> 01:10:52,155
People get killed all the time
doing stuff like this.

932
01:10:52,165 --> 01:10:54,791
I need you to hold
the other end tightly.

933
01:10:54,801 --> 01:10:57,627
Stop! You're jumping
into raw sewage.

934
01:10:57,637 --> 01:11:01,334
This is not sewage, okay?
It's sulfur.

935
01:11:01,441 --> 01:11:03,666
I noticed before
when I tested the water,

936
01:11:03,676 --> 01:11:06,335
it's warmer than
the room temperature.

937
01:11:06,345 --> 01:11:10,473
And this brown color indicates
an iron sulfite hot springs.

938
01:11:10,483 --> 01:11:11,574
There's no reasoning with you.

939
01:11:11,584 --> 01:11:13,109
You have an answer
for everything.

940
01:11:13,119 --> 01:11:15,078
That really bothers you.

941
01:11:15,088 --> 01:11:17,146
I was hoping that I wasn't
going to have to say this.

942
01:11:17,156 --> 01:11:19,082
- What?
- Don't make me say it.

943
01:11:19,092 --> 01:11:21,217
All right, then.

944
01:11:22,962 --> 01:11:24,921
There's no gold, okay?

945
01:11:24,931 --> 01:11:25,988
There's no treasure.

946
01:11:25,998 --> 01:11:28,291
You're about to jump
into a sewer.

947
01:11:28,301 --> 01:11:30,851
This whole thing
is a delusion.

948
01:11:41,814 --> 01:11:45,341
Sir, put your arms
out to your sides.

949
01:11:45,451 --> 01:11:48,711
Sir... put your arms
all the way out to your sides,

950
01:11:48,721 --> 01:11:50,146
like Jesus on the cross.

951
01:11:50,156 --> 01:11:53,726
Straight out.
There you go, just like that.

952
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:04,460
Pepper.
Come in, Pepper.

953
01:12:05,838 --> 01:12:08,534
I need some help in here.

954
01:12:08,641 --> 01:12:11,067
- Pepper, are you there?
- Roll him over.

955
01:12:11,077 --> 01:12:14,376
Pepper, the button's
on the side.

956
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:17,455
Pepper, push the button
on the side.

957
01:12:18,484 --> 01:12:20,977
Ventura 105 to all units,
be advised.

958
01:12:20,987 --> 01:12:23,312
We believe we've got
a 459 there now

959
01:12:23,322 --> 01:12:25,322
inside the Costco.

960
01:12:25,358 --> 01:12:28,163
Any available unit
please respond.

961
01:12:28,928 --> 01:12:30,019
Damn.

962
01:12:44,710 --> 01:12:46,235
Pepper, where are you?

963
01:12:58,424 --> 01:13:00,716
Pepper, is that you?

964
01:13:10,203 --> 01:13:12,797
Pepper, please come in.

965
01:13:12,905 --> 01:13:15,135
Where are you, Pepper?

966
01:14:45,798 --> 01:14:51,031
"Journal of Father Torres,
February 9th, 1624.

967
01:14:51,137 --> 01:14:53,230
"Final entry.

968
01:14:53,339 --> 01:14:55,798
"We were trapped in a cavern
whose walls were marked

969
01:14:55,808 --> 01:14:57,633
"with their
childish carvings.

970
01:14:57,643 --> 01:15:01,470
"A cavern sometimes used
for whatever variety of pagan ritual

971
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:04,373
"which these lost people
felt compelled to observe.

972
01:15:04,383 --> 01:15:06,008
Miranda.

973
01:15:06,018 --> 01:15:07,710
"I miss my home

974
01:15:07,720 --> 01:15:10,246
and wish to leave this land
so filled with madness."

975
01:15:10,256 --> 01:15:12,918
I found it! I...

976
01:15:15,594 --> 01:15:17,594
Miranda.

977
01:15:28,107 --> 01:15:31,082
Come on, my little
sack of potatoes.

978
01:16:18,758 --> 01:16:21,056
You smell awful.

979
01:16:25,164 --> 01:16:28,156
I found it.

980
01:16:28,267 --> 01:16:30,092
Didn't get all of it.

981
01:16:30,102 --> 01:16:33,230
Still a lot more
down there.

982
01:16:33,305 --> 01:16:35,500
I gotta go back.

983
01:16:35,608 --> 01:16:37,608
Huh?

984
01:16:40,746 --> 01:16:42,746
Do you believe me?

985
01:17:03,002 --> 01:17:04,360
What are you going to do?

986
01:17:04,370 --> 01:17:06,668
You're staying right there.

987
01:17:06,772 --> 01:17:08,772
What about you?

988
01:17:10,643 --> 01:17:12,168
You know, when I was
at the hospital

989
01:17:12,178 --> 01:17:14,437
I used read a lot
of biographies

990
01:17:14,447 --> 01:17:16,711
about these great men.

991
01:17:16,816 --> 01:17:19,308
The thing was that their dads...
well, they weren't so great.

992
01:17:19,318 --> 01:17:21,010
- They were screw-ups.
- What are you doing?

993
01:17:21,020 --> 01:17:24,854
Then, I started to see
that all my life

994
01:17:24,957 --> 01:17:27,817
I've been trying
to do something great.

995
01:17:27,827 --> 01:17:30,653
But then I realized
that I was laying

996
01:17:30,663 --> 01:17:33,393
the groundwork for you.

997
01:17:34,967 --> 01:17:37,629
You know, to do something...

998
01:17:37,703 --> 01:17:42,697
great or whatever.

999
01:17:42,808 --> 01:17:46,073
But your dad
was a screw-up, too.

1000
01:17:46,178 --> 01:17:48,476
Well, it was just a theory.

1001
01:17:52,051 --> 01:17:54,091
What are we going to do?

1002
01:17:56,088 --> 01:17:57,713
Wait. Wait, wait.
Char...

1003
01:17:57,723 --> 01:18:01,591
This is very important.

1004
01:18:01,694 --> 01:18:03,992
Don't lose it.

1005
01:18:04,063 --> 01:18:05,354
Wait, where are you going?

1006
01:18:05,364 --> 01:18:07,756
Just tell them that
I forced you into this.

1007
01:18:07,766 --> 01:18:09,525
- What?
- You just tell them I'm nuts.

1008
01:18:09,535 --> 01:18:10,726
Charlie.
Charlie.

1009
01:18:10,736 --> 01:18:13,034
Charlie, come on.
Charlie.

1010
01:18:13,105 --> 01:18:16,006
I don't think...

1011
01:18:16,075 --> 01:18:21,604
that I've thanked you, ever,
for what you've done for me.

1012
01:18:26,051 --> 01:18:28,051
Thank you.

1013
01:18:29,788 --> 01:18:31,788
Thank you.

1014
01:18:38,430 --> 01:18:41,695
Wait. Charlie.
Charlie!

1015
01:18:41,767 --> 01:18:42,892
Charlie!

1016
01:18:42,902 --> 01:18:47,703
And don't let them push you around.

1017
01:18:47,773 --> 01:18:50,367
Charlie, come on, please.

1018
01:18:50,442 --> 01:18:52,438
Charlie!

1019
01:18:52,448 --> 01:18:54,904
Charlie.

1020
01:18:54,914 --> 01:18:58,975
Charlie, wait, wait!
Come back!

1021
01:18:59,084 --> 01:19:01,084
Dad!

1022
01:20:02,982 --> 01:20:04,982
Hey, you!

1023
01:20:14,893 --> 01:20:16,893
Follow me!

1024
01:20:27,973 --> 01:20:29,973
Shit!

1025
01:21:11,016 --> 01:21:13,442
They searched all night,

1026
01:21:13,452 --> 01:21:16,682
but they never did
find Charlie's body.

1027
01:21:27,466 --> 01:21:28,957
One of the cops asked me

1028
01:21:28,967 --> 01:21:32,562
why Charlie jumped back
into the hole.

1029
01:21:32,638 --> 01:21:36,298
I told him it was where
Charlie wanted to go.

1030
01:21:36,308 --> 01:21:39,468
It was where he wanted
to go all along.

1031
01:21:39,478 --> 01:21:41,704
The cop looked at me
like I was crazy

1032
01:21:41,714 --> 01:21:44,434
and stopped asking me questions.

1033
01:21:53,125 --> 01:21:58,120
What I didn't tell them
was that if Charlie hadn't tied me up,

1034
01:21:58,130 --> 01:22:00,850
I probably would've
followed him.

1035
01:24:12,364 --> 01:24:16,558
Want to know how
California got its name?

1036
01:24:16,568 --> 01:24:20,698
It's not named after
some explorer or king.

1037
01:24:20,772 --> 01:24:22,264
Nope.

1038
01:24:22,274 --> 01:24:24,708
Someone made the name up.

1039
01:24:24,776 --> 01:24:26,776
A writer.

1040
01:24:26,812 --> 01:24:29,104
He just pulled it
out of his imagination

1041
01:24:29,114 --> 01:24:33,483
in the 16th century in Spain.

1042
01:24:33,585 --> 01:24:38,080
He made up this place where
there was unlimited gold and pearls,

1043
01:24:38,090 --> 01:24:43,585
and beautiful, fierce women who
wore gold armor and rode wild beasts,

1044
01:24:43,595 --> 01:24:46,145
and he called it "California."

1045
01:24:47,733 --> 01:24:49,826
It's true.

1046
01:24:49,935 --> 01:24:52,094
It was a bestseller back then.

1047
01:24:52,104 --> 01:24:54,800
Oh, yeah!

1048
01:25:00,779 --> 01:25:03,939
Charlie told me that.

1049
01:25:03,949 --> 01:25:08,199
He said I could look it up
if I didn't believe him.

1050
01:25:09,121 --> 01:25:11,117
But I didn't need to.

1051
01:25:27,706 --> 01:25:29,264
Excuse me?

1052
01:25:29,274 --> 01:25:32,937
Beautiful place.
This is California, huh?

1053
01:25:39,885 --> 01:25:40,976
Yeah.

1054
01:25:52,197 --> 01:25:54,197
Welcome.
