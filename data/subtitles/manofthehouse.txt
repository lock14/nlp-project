1
00:00:55,795 --> 00:00:58,870
Says your sourCe got religion
while he was in the Can.

2
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:01,111
-You trust him?
-No.

3
00:01:02,963 --> 00:01:05,196
SharP, we're going to a ChurCh.

4
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:07,878
That's why l didn't bring a heliCoPter.

5
00:01:10,892 --> 00:01:12,931
Everybody, get your hands uP.

6
00:01:14,056 --> 00:01:15,776
Now keeP them uP...

7
00:01:16,018 --> 00:01:17,818
and say, ''Hey!''

8
00:01:18,021 --> 00:01:19,296
Say, ''Oh!''

9
00:01:22,186 --> 00:01:24,497
All right. Then go ahead.

10
00:01:24,909 --> 00:01:28,907
We have learned from the three wise men...

11
00:01:29,755 --> 00:01:31,155
The O'Jays...

12
00:01:31,997 --> 00:01:35,516
Eddie, Walter, and the other guy...

13
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:39,599
that there is a train Coming...

14
00:01:39,686 --> 00:01:42,078
and it is a train of love.

15
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:45,726
MiChael rowed his boat ashore.

16
00:01:49,418 --> 00:01:54,133
BeCause he, too, wanted to get
off that water and get on the train.

17
00:01:54,343 --> 00:01:55,824
Had the tjcket.

18
00:02:10,643 --> 00:02:13,444
And l, too, want to be on that same train.

19
00:02:13,606 --> 00:02:17,080
So l will see everyone next week. HoPefully.

20
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,299
PerCy Stevens. What's it been?

21
00:02:27,382 --> 00:02:30,058
Three to five years with time off
for good behaviour?

22
00:02:30,146 --> 00:02:32,423
SharP, how are you?

23
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:36,147
This is a ChurCh, all right?

24
00:02:36,233 --> 00:02:39,034
A PlaCe that's saCred.
And it shall remain untainted.

25
00:02:39,116 --> 00:02:42,590
We're looking for an old Cellmate of yours,
Morgan Ball. You seen him?

26
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,354
He's a key witness in one of my Cases.

27
00:02:44,442 --> 00:02:47,836
Come on, man.
l don't hang with that Crowd anymore.

28
00:02:48,487 --> 00:02:51,801
l am a ProPhet in a non-Profit world.

29
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:17,600
Aren't you worried about him getting away?

30
00:03:20,965 --> 00:03:24,041
l'm more worried
about him having a heart attaCk.

31
00:03:47,917 --> 00:03:50,354
You want me to Call an ambulanCe for you?

32
00:03:52,202 --> 00:03:55,881
Look, man, l don't even know
why l'm running in the first PlaCe.

33
00:03:55,966 --> 00:03:57,287
l'm on God's side now.

34
00:03:57,368 --> 00:03:59,281
Give us the Phone, PerCy.

35
00:04:00,131 --> 00:04:03,811
Man, why are you all treating me
like l'm some little Punk kid?

36
00:04:03,976 --> 00:04:06,014
Besides, the Lord says:

37
00:04:06,098 --> 00:04:08,980
''He who is without sin Cast the first stone.''

38
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:14,066
-What the hell is wrong with you?
-lt sliPPed.

39
00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:16,667
Where's the damn Phone at?

40
00:04:25,201 --> 00:04:26,396
Holy Cow!

41
00:04:27,043 --> 00:04:29,844
lt's a musiCal Cow. Look at it. lt's a miraCle.

42
00:04:29,926 --> 00:04:31,999
Like the Parting of the Red Sea.

43
00:04:32,089 --> 00:04:35,210
Or the time l saw Mike Tyson's faCe
in a taCo.

44
00:04:35,573 --> 00:04:37,486
What is he doing?

45
00:04:38,256 --> 00:04:41,058
No. l know he's not about to do that.
Come on, man.

46
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:43,098
He gonna really Put his hand uP that Cow?

47
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:46,143
You Can't do that.
lt's against the Cow's rights, man.

48
00:04:46,946 --> 00:04:48,427
What's uP with the....

49
00:04:48,508 --> 00:04:50,741

Hello.

52
00:05:08,652 --> 00:05:11,374
Hey, Morgan. Calm down, man.

53
00:05:11,856 --> 00:05:14,931
All units, stand by for the whereabouts
of our friend Morgan Ball.

54
00:05:34,562 --> 00:05:36,122
They're Coming in.

55
00:05:37,526 --> 00:05:41,239
Texas Rangers looking for Morgan Ball!
Sure hoPe we don't have the wrong house!

56
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:42,651
Go to hell!

57
00:06:15,771 --> 00:06:17,729
Morgan, don't run.

58
00:06:34,553 --> 00:06:37,116
Eddie Zane, FBl.
How the hell did that fire start?

59
00:06:37,196 --> 00:06:38,711
l don't know. We heard some shots.

60
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:41,190
-Who's in there?
-SharP and Swanson.

61
00:06:42,282 --> 00:06:43,477
Christ.

62
00:06:50,251 --> 00:06:52,404
You know what's in those barrels, right?

63
00:06:52,494 --> 00:06:54,886
One wrong shot and we Could all go.

64
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:59,221
Look, Ball, you have three ChoiCes:

65
00:06:59,542 --> 00:07:02,856
A: You Could stay in this hellhole
and burn to death.

66
00:07:03,227 --> 00:07:06,826
B: You Can Come with us
and testify against John Cortland.

67
00:07:06,911 --> 00:07:08,505
A and B suCk.

68
00:07:08,753 --> 00:07:10,268
What about C?

69
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,594
C is my Personal favourite.

70
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:14,753
Take it easy.

71
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,403
l'm sure there's a way
we Can work out this whole thing.

72
00:07:17,483 --> 00:07:20,046
Seems like it's Pretty well worked out to me.

73
00:07:20,127 --> 00:07:22,438
l got money. Lots of money.

74
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:25,207
lf you get me out of here,
l'll make you both riCh.

75
00:07:25,293 --> 00:07:28,254
Look, see this key? lt's yours.

Thank you. l'll Put that in evidenCe.

77
00:07:30,379 --> 00:07:34,342
Look, l Can't testify.
Cortland will kill me. lt's a death sentenCe.

78
00:07:37,307 --> 00:07:39,379
Let's go outside and talk it over.

79
00:07:56,489 --> 00:07:58,369
You gotta be kidding me.

80
00:07:59,052 --> 00:08:00,282
NiCe job, SharP.

81
00:08:00,374 --> 00:08:03,096
What's that they say?
''Texas Rangers always get their man''?

82
00:08:03,177 --> 00:08:05,010
That's the Royal Canadian Mounted PoliCe.

83
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:08,140
You both have funny hats and funny boots.
Who Can tell you aPart?

84
00:08:08,223 --> 00:08:10,022
-Long time, Eddie.
-More than five years.

85
00:08:10,105 --> 00:08:13,385
Margaret Swanson, Eddie Zane.
He's with the Federal Bureau of ldiots.

86
00:08:13,469 --> 00:08:16,749
l'd have beCome a Ranger
if they said my Partner would look like you.

87
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:19,909
lf you were a Ranger,
you'd have Caught this bastard by yourself.

88
00:08:19,997 --> 00:08:23,198
That's the beautiful thing
about working for the federal government.

89
00:08:23,281 --> 00:08:25,673
Other PeoPle do your grunt work for you.

90
00:08:28,487 --> 00:08:30,207
-How's your daughter doing?
-Real good.

91

We shouldn't say anything

We don't need laWyers.
We djdn't do anythjng.

00:14:48,334 --> 00:14:50,054
Oh, my God. Do you know Derek Jeter?

165
00:14:50,136 --> 00:14:53,496
No, he means the other Texas Rangers.
You know, like the Lone Ranger.

166
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:56,416
He had that Cool lndian friend.

167
00:14:56,503 --> 00:14:57,574
Tonto?

168
00:14:57,665 --> 00:15:00,580
He was hot.
Why don't guys wear loinCloths anymore?

169
00:15:00,668 --> 00:15:04,382
A Texas Ranger was shot this evening
in ConneCtion to the murder you witnessed.

170
00:15:04,473 --> 00:15:06,864
Anything you remember,
no matter how insignifiCant...

171
00:15:06,956 --> 00:15:09,188
may be of the utmost imPortanCe.

172
00:15:12,963 --> 00:15:14,956
-Do you want a PieCe?
-No, l do not.

173
00:15:15,045 --> 00:15:16,605
-You don't like gum?
-No.

174
00:15:16,687 --> 00:15:20,479
Chewing gum is the most signifiCant faCtor
in the deCline of Western Civilization.

175
00:15:20,572 --> 00:15:21,801
The deCline of what?

176
00:15:21,893 --> 00:15:24,649
When PeoPle Chew gum,
nobody Can read their exPressions.

177
00:15:24,736 --> 00:15:26,251
Like with BOTOX.

178
00:15:35,109 --> 00:15:37,580
l like an older man
who knows what he wants.

179
00:15:38,513 --> 00:15:39,788
All right.

180
00:15:40,555 --> 00:15:42,513
We should so not get involved in this.

181
00:15:42,597 --> 00:15:44,556
Oh, God, here she goes again.

182
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,918
-She do this a lot?
-Whenever she gets nervous.

183
00:15:47,003 --> 00:15:49,394
She droPs, like, 10 Pounds around finals.

184
00:15:49,486 --> 00:15:51,399
Can anybody desCribe the PerPetrator?

185
00:15:51,488 --> 00:15:52,808
''PerPetrator''?

186
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:55,203
The bad man with the gun.

187
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:57,286
ACtually, he was kind of Cute.

188
00:15:57,375 --> 00:16:01,498
Gross. He was a total skank.
On a sCale of 1 to 10, l'd give him a 4.

189
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:04,620
No, a ruthless killer's kind of sexy.
l give him an 8.

190
00:16:04,703 --> 00:16:07,346
Let's try to ConCentrate. How tall was he?

191
00:16:07,427 --> 00:16:09,067
Average. Like, 5'10''.

192
00:16:09,149 --> 00:16:10,869
No way. 6'2'' at least.

193
00:16:10,951 --> 00:16:12,625
l thought he was kind of short.

194
00:16:12,713 --> 00:16:14,273
What about his hair?

195
00:16:14,355 --> 00:16:15,915
Definitely needs to rethink his Cut.

196
00:16:15,997 --> 00:16:20,598
-l mean the Colour of his hair.
-lt was dark. Almost blaCk.

197
00:16:20,682 --> 00:16:21,958
l thought it was blond.

198
00:16:22,044 --> 00:16:24,436
-What?
-This is bad.

199
00:16:25,728 --> 00:16:27,322
Did he have any...

200
00:16:28,051 --> 00:16:31,092
distinCtive faCial CharaCteristiCs?

201
00:16:36,981 --> 00:16:39,863
Sideburns? A moustaChe?

202
00:16:40,105 --> 00:16:43,385
-There might've been a moustaChe.
-No, definitely not.

203
00:16:43,589 --> 00:16:46,026
Was l the only one who saw a goatee?

204
00:16:58,447 --> 00:17:00,121
Look at these guys.

205
00:17:00,409 --> 00:17:01,890
You guys, wait.

206
00:17:04,534 --> 00:17:08,451
Wait. Looks like your ex-boyfriend,
Brook Burton.

207
00:17:08,659 --> 00:17:10,139

227
00:18:27,832 --> 00:18:28,868

l'm getting Phone Calls from some daddies
that are worried about their daughters.

233
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,779
They have good reason to be ConCerned, sir.

234
00:18:53,862 --> 00:18:57,576
lf Cortland finds out there are witnesses,
he'll Come after them sure as hell.

235
00:18:57,667 --> 00:19:01,380
Gentlemen, l told those guys we'd take Care

-Turn the motor off.
-Problem, sir?

This vehiCle will not move

Well, l think we're gonna have to turn
that frown uPside down.

335
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:08,243
Now this Cannot be how you helPed
Florida State to the regional finals.

336
00:26:08,854 --> 00:26:10,926
-CoaCh Beauregard?
-Please, Binky.

337
00:26:11,016 --> 00:26:12,292
Okay, Binky.

338
00:26:12,378 --> 00:26:14,451

00:26:14,541 --> 00:26:17,661
and l'm gonna leave the grinning

00:26:17,744 --> 00:26:21,537
Well, okey-dokey then.

00:26:25,914 --> 00:26:27,109

Texas.

343
00:27:07,163 --> 00:27:08,199
Gun!

344
00:27:23,181 --> 00:27:24,298
A water gun, sir.

345
00:27:24,383 --> 00:27:26,694
Please don't hurt me. lt's just a joke.

346
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:36,465
NiCe hit!

347
00:28:24,253 --> 00:28:25,654
CheCk it out.

348
00:28:32,543 --> 00:28:34,103
Howdy, neighbour.

349
00:28:34,786 --> 00:28:36,699
l'm Jimmy from next door.

350
00:28:37,028 --> 00:28:40,388
Just wanted to Come by
and welCome you to the building.

351
00:28:40,512 --> 00:28:44,556
And, you know,
if you need any weed or anything...

352
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:47,557
just Come bang on my door.

353
00:28:49,122 --> 00:28:51,116
That's good to know, Jimmy.

354
00:28:51,285 --> 00:28:54,121
-You'll definitely be hearing from us.
-Cool.

355
00:28:57,452 --> 00:28:58,807
2200 hours.

356
00:28:58,894 --> 00:29:00,409
HE-BAT js secure.

357
00:29:00,496 --> 00:29:03,297
Roger that. We'll see y'all in the morning.

358
00:29:16,074 --> 00:29:17,509
l don't sleeP.

359
00:29:20,439 --> 00:29:22,318
lsn't that your Partner?

360
00:29:25,325 --> 00:29:28,560
-Shouldn't you have gone to the hosPital?
-No.

361
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:30,685
l'm here.

362
00:29:31,052 --> 00:29:33,090
Right. But she's been shot.

363
00:29:33,174 --> 00:29:35,007
That's Part of the job.

364
00:29:38,741 --> 00:29:40,779
You ever kill anyone, SharP?

365
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:56,561
Cold bastard Probably doesn't even Care.

366
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:05,523
Her middle name is Ellen.

367
00:30:07,054 --> 00:30:10,767
A lot of the fellas weren't haPPy when
the Rangers started reCruiting women...

368
00:30:10,859 --> 00:30:13,011
and l was sure enough one of them.

369
00:30:15,864 --> 00:30:17,538
She Changed my mind.

370
00:30:21,631 --> 00:30:23,464
l also hear everything.

371
00:30:25,476 --> 00:30:28,836
''The brightness of her Cheek
would shame those stars

372
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,913
''As daylight doth a lamP

373
00:30:31,002 --> 00:30:33,235
''her eyes in heaven

374
00:30:33,325 --> 00:30:35,558
''Would through the airy region
stream so bright

375
00:30:35,648 --> 00:30:39,088
''That birds would sing
and think it were not night''

376
00:30:39,893 --> 00:30:44,096
So your assignment is
to write a five-Page PaPer...

377
00:30:44,178 --> 00:30:45,898
due a week from Friday...

378
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:49,020
desCribing the funCtion
of the reCurrent imagery...

379
00:30:49,104 --> 00:30:52,179
of light against darkness
in Romeo and Juljet.

380
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:55,263
What does it mean? How does it mean it?

381
00:30:55,912 --> 00:30:58,475
And is it Possible that this Play...

382
00:30:58,595 --> 00:31:02,035
is more than just a teenage romanCe
with a sad ending?

383
00:31:05,563 --> 00:31:09,196
Miss ThomPson.
l want to see you in my offiCe. Now.

384
00:31:18,498 --> 00:31:20,651
-She'd like to see you.
-What for?

385
00:31:20,741 --> 00:31:22,175
l don't know.

386
00:31:26,187 --> 00:31:29,228
Mr. SharP. Come in. Have a seat.

387
00:31:34,597 --> 00:31:37,638
So, l understand you're
the new assistant Cheerleading CoaCh.

388
00:31:37,721 --> 00:31:38,711
That's right.

389
00:31:38,802 --> 00:31:40,715
May l ask what you were doing in my Class?

390
00:31:40,804 --> 00:31:44,882
That's the way we do things on our squad.
lf somebody's in the--

391
00:31:44,969 --> 00:31:46,963
Let me be blunt, Mr. SharP.

392
00:31:47,052 --> 00:31:50,047
Barb's Cheerleading
is interfering with her work.

393
00:31:50,295 --> 00:31:53,496
And for the reCord, you should know
l think Cheerleading is stuPid.

394
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:55,812
l Couldn't agree with you more.

395
00:31:56,943 --> 00:32:00,827
She downloaded this PaPer
on Plant imagery in Macbeth...

396
00:32:01,108 --> 00:32:02,463
off the lnternet.

397
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:06,548
l know, beCause l wrote it 20 years ago
when l was an undergraduate.

398
00:32:06,995 --> 00:32:08,953
Must be a hell of a PaPer.

399
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:12,230
Yes, l thought it was Pretty good.

400
00:32:12,802 --> 00:32:17,119
But that is not the Point.
Plagiarism is simPly not aCCePtable.

401
00:32:17,407 --> 00:32:19,765
l've given Barb an F on that assignment.

402
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:23,530
lf she wants to remain on the squad,
or in the sChool, for that matter...

403
00:32:23,615 --> 00:32:27,134
her next PaPer on Romeo and Juljet
had better be wholly original.

404
00:32:27,219 --> 00:32:28,893
l'll exPlain your Position to Barb...

405
00:32:28,981 --> 00:32:32,102
and make sure she understands it,
exPliCitly.

406
00:32:33,386 --> 00:32:34,707
Well, good.

407
00:32:36,189 --> 00:32:37,260
Fine.

408
00:32:39,914 --> 00:32:43,034
Okay, what's the big deal?
Presidents don't write their sPeeChes.

409
00:32:43,118 --> 00:32:46,592
When you're President, you Can be
as lenient as you want to on Plagiarism.

410
00:32:46,682 --> 00:32:48,640
But wait. This Play has five aCts.

411
00:32:48,724 --> 00:32:50,763
She Can't exPeCt me to read the whole thing.

412
00:32:50,847 --> 00:32:53,318
lt's all written in ye olde
weird English anyway.

413
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:55,973
-Hey, Barb.
-Hi, SCoot.

414
00:32:56,333 --> 00:33:00,456
Besides, PeoPle think being a Cheerleader
is this nonstoP Party and everything...

415
00:33:00,538 --> 00:33:02,337
but, you know, they're so wrong.

416
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:04,219
-Hey, Barb.
-Hi, Chase.

417
00:33:04,463 --> 00:33:06,695
Aside from all my games and my PraCtiCes...

418
00:33:06,785 --> 00:33:10,544
they still exPeCt me to maintain
this 2.0 average, and l Can't do that.

419
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:12,224
You need to manage your time better.

420
00:33:12,312 --> 00:33:15,513
Time? What time? l don't have any time.

421
00:33:15,596 --> 00:33:17,873
-Hey, Barb.
-Hi, Tim.

422
00:33:17,959 --> 00:33:20,795
-Tom.
-Shoot! Sorry. Tom.

423
00:33:21,282 --> 00:33:22,478
l really liked him, too.

424
00:33:22,564 --> 00:33:24,956
You got some admirers on this CamPus,
don't you?

425
00:33:25,047 --> 00:33:27,610
Don't be jealous. They're just silly boys.

426
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:30,491
We Can stoP this Charade
and run away together.

427
00:33:30,573 --> 00:33:32,088
You got a PaPer to write.

428
00:33:32,175 --> 00:33:34,738
l know. But if l write it myself,
it'll just be stuPid.

429
00:33:34,818 --> 00:33:36,857
You don't know that
beCause you haven't tried.

430
00:33:36,941 --> 00:33:39,333
Cheating is a hell of a lot worse
than being stuPid.

431
00:33:39,424 --> 00:33:43,707
Plagiarism is an aCademiC Crime.
lt is Punishable by aCademiC death.

432
00:33:45,431 --> 00:33:46,501
What do you Care anyway?

433
00:33:46,592 --> 00:33:50,590
l wanna see you stay alive, aCademiCally,
PhysiCally, and every other way.

434
00:33:51,358 --> 00:33:53,396
-You like me, don't you?
-No.

435
00:34:24,957 --> 00:34:26,871
Guys, stand by one moment.

436
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,394
Sergeant, your Pizza's here.

437
00:34:29,643 --> 00:34:30,963
Roger that.

438
00:34:34,649 --> 00:34:36,323
Set the Pizza on the PorCh...

439
00:34:36,411 --> 00:34:39,885
take two stePs baCk,
and PlaCe your hands behind your head.

440
00:34:56,755 --> 00:34:57,905
What's the Problem, dude?

441
00:34:57,996 --> 00:35:00,718
lf that Pizza's hot,
there won't be any Problem.

442
00:35:11,852 --> 00:35:14,768
-All right, what do l owe you?
-$13.75.

443
00:35:19,582 --> 00:35:22,304
Hey, do you live here with all these girls?

444
00:35:22,385 --> 00:35:23,739
TemPorarily.

445
00:35:23,867 --> 00:35:25,780
Dude, you're my new hero.

446
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:29,103
lmagine what that means to me.

447
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,479
-Thank you.
-You're welCome.

448
00:35:38,644 --> 00:35:41,640
Without my Phone, l am nothing,
l am worthless.

449
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:44,125
l need to sPeak to my Antonio....

450
00:35:47,895 --> 00:35:50,013
-What is that?
-The Carnivore.

451
00:35:50,498 --> 00:35:55,054
PePPeroni, sausage, ground beef, ham, and
olive loaf, all together in one savoury Pie.

452
00:35:56,505 --> 00:35:57,986
With jalaPenos.

453
00:35:58,267 --> 00:36:00,146
-Want some?
-Yes. No.

454
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:02,030
Extra-thiCk Crust.

455
00:36:02,112 --> 00:36:04,105
-l Can't. l'm on the Zone.
-What zone?

456
00:36:04,194 --> 00:36:06,870
The ProPer Combination
of Protein, fat, and Carbohydrates.

457
00:36:06,957 --> 00:36:08,597
This Combination's ProPer as hell.

458
00:36:08,679 --> 00:36:10,034
l'm a total Atkins girl.

459
00:36:10,121 --> 00:36:11,350
l do Weight WatChers.

460
00:36:11,443 --> 00:36:14,358
You'll Probably blow all your daily Points
with just one bite.

461
00:36:14,446 --> 00:36:18,842
This baby has one Point and one Point only,
and that is tasting good.

462
00:36:19,172 --> 00:36:23,329
l don't know why you girls are on a diet.
You Couldn't weigh any more than--

463
00:36:23,977 --> 00:36:25,332
Don't even go there.

464
00:36:25,419 --> 00:36:27,811
No, there are some things
we just don't disCuss.

465
00:36:27,902 --> 00:36:29,735
My daughter has a very healthy aPPetite.

466
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:32,216
lnteresting. You never mentioned
you had a daughter.

467
00:36:32,307 --> 00:36:33,423
-What's her name?
-Emma.

468
00:36:33,509 --> 00:36:35,023
-How old is she?
-Seventeen.

469
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,750
-ls she a Cheerleader?
-l hoPe not.

470
00:36:36,832 --> 00:36:39,589
-What's her favourite band?
-You got me.

471
00:36:39,676 --> 00:36:41,030
How about her sign?

472
00:36:41,117 --> 00:36:42,791
ls she sexually aCtive?

473
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,634
-Hell, no.
-She Probably is.

474
00:36:44,722 --> 00:36:47,319
68%% of high-sChool students
in Texas have had sex...

475
00:36:47,405 --> 00:36:49,363
by the time they've reaChed the 1 2th grade.

476
00:36:49,447 --> 00:36:51,486
Slightly higher than the national average.

477
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:52,970
Thank you for ruining my day.

478
00:36:53,052 --> 00:36:56,252
l'll tell you one thing about this daughter
you know nothing about.

479
00:36:56,335 --> 00:37:00,219
She must be suPremely messed uP
in the head from living in a house with you.

480
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,894
She lives with her mother.

481
00:37:01,982 --> 00:37:03,417
Why did your marriage fall aPart?

482
00:37:03,504 --> 00:37:06,305
That's one of many things
that you and l will never disCuss.

483
00:37:06,387 --> 00:37:09,303
You see, you Clearly don't know
how to sPeak to women.

484
00:37:09,391 --> 00:37:12,990
l know how to sPeak to women.
l Clearly Choose not to.

485
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:45,671
We need to establish
this bathroom at the end of the hall...

486
00:37:45,753 --> 00:37:47,587
is a 100%% masCuline bathroom.

487
00:37:47,676 --> 00:37:51,719
From this moment on, it is off-limits to
you PeoPle and your foolish undergarments.

488
00:37:51,801 --> 00:37:54,477
-You want an egg-white omelette?
-Does that mean no yolks?

489
00:37:54,564 --> 00:37:55,793
-No yolks.
-No, thanks.

490
00:37:55,885 --> 00:37:57,605
-Want some kamut flakes?
-What?

491
00:37:57,688 --> 00:38:00,888
-AnCient grain. Tastes great with soymilk.
-Soymilk.

492
00:38:03,975 --> 00:38:06,492
-Who ate all my kamut flakes?
-Not me.

493
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:10,542
What am l,
the Organisation to End World Hunger?

494
00:38:10,623 --> 00:38:12,900
This is my Cereal.

495
00:38:13,466 --> 00:38:17,430
Why do you girls find it neCessary
to listen to this Constant CraP?

496
00:38:18,031 --> 00:38:19,625
You don't like vagina musiC?

497
00:38:19,713 --> 00:38:23,107
Do you have to use that word
before l've had my Coffee and soymilk?

498
00:38:23,198 --> 00:38:25,634
-Vagina.
-Whose?

499
00:38:26,201 --> 00:38:29,880
-What did l tell y'all about wearing Clothes?
-Jog bras are Clothes.

500
00:38:31,047 --> 00:38:32,322
That's it.

501
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:35,127
That is it.

502
00:39:03,845 --> 00:39:05,599
Just sign right there.

503
00:39:05,687 --> 00:39:08,364
-Awful big unit for a house this size.
-l get hot.

504
00:39:08,451 --> 00:39:09,771
l hear you.

505
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:36,759
All right. You win, okay?
We all agree to Put on more Clothes.

506
00:39:36,844 --> 00:39:38,757
Now, Can you Please
turn the temPerature uP?

507
00:39:38,846 --> 00:39:41,489
That's a very mature deCision
and l'm Proud of you girls.

508
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:43,642
But we should Come
to a Common understanding...

509
00:39:43,732 --> 00:39:46,648
the meaning, the definition
of the word ''more.''

510
00:39:47,256 --> 00:39:48,816
We thought you might say that.

511
00:39:48,898 --> 00:39:49,969
Barb!

512
00:39:51,982 --> 00:39:55,900
All righty.
This is Courtney Ryan, my Personal hero.

513
00:39:56,547 --> 00:40:00,340
Like Courtney, we feel we should not
be Penalised for maximising our assets.

514
00:40:00,432 --> 00:40:03,667
However, we've all agreed to Cover uP...

515
00:40:04,196 --> 00:40:05,870
these areas here...

516
00:40:06,279 --> 00:40:07,873
and this area right here.

517
00:40:07,961 --> 00:40:08,997
Good.

518
00:40:10,724 --> 00:40:13,161
But what about these other Problem areas?

519
00:40:14,008 --> 00:40:15,158
Here...

520
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:17,080
here...

521
00:40:17,852 --> 00:40:19,128
and here.

522
00:40:20,375 --> 00:40:21,969
You're killing me.

523
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:25,295
Come here.

524
00:40:31,869 --> 00:40:34,147
All right. We'll Cave on the first two.

525
00:40:34,232 --> 00:40:36,589
But we absolutely must maintain
navel visibility.

526
00:40:36,674 --> 00:40:38,668
We want to be realistiC, not Amish.

527
00:40:38,757 --> 00:40:40,590
-One inCh on either side.
-Three.

528
00:40:40,679 --> 00:40:42,034
-Two.
-Done.

529
00:40:52,854 --> 00:40:54,892
These gjrls are a djfferent kettle of Worms.

530
00:40:54,976 --> 00:40:57,777
Something just Came uP. l'll get baCk to you.

531
00:40:58,941 --> 00:41:01,252
l need to sPeak to your witnesses.

532
00:41:04,948 --> 00:41:06,702
Eddie, how's the arm?

533
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:08,704
Let's not Change the subjeCt.

534
00:41:08,792 --> 00:41:10,227
There are no witnesses.

535
00:41:10,314 --> 00:41:13,435
Even if there was, l Couldn't let you
talk to them. You know that.

536
00:41:13,518 --> 00:41:15,989
Come on, CaPtain,
we're on the same team here.

537
00:41:16,081 --> 00:41:17,721
l think l Can helP.

538
00:41:17,883 --> 00:41:20,878
At least let me talk to SharP.
That was him on the Phone, right?

539
00:41:20,967 --> 00:41:23,199
SharP's in the field right now.

540
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:24,800
Right.

541
00:41:25,932 --> 00:41:28,403
Your Ranger sCrewed uP my whole Case.

542
00:41:28,616 --> 00:41:30,893
He blew uP that lab
and all the evidenCe in it.

543
00:41:30,978 --> 00:41:33,654
Ball is dead
and l got shot in the arm, for Christ's sake.

544
00:41:33,742 --> 00:41:38,138
l need to sPeak to those witnesses.
So l'm asking you again. Where are they?

545
00:41:43,713 --> 00:41:47,552
This ''One Riot, One Ranger'' shit won't fly
when l slaP a subPoena on your desk.

546
00:41:47,638 --> 00:41:49,471
My desk's already a mess.

547
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:52,761
One more PieCe of PaPer
won't make me no never mind.

548
00:41:54,686 --> 00:41:57,966
CirCle the wagons if you want.
This is a federal Case.

549
00:42:19,555 --> 00:42:22,118
-You learn quiCk.
-Five years of College.

550
00:42:22,199 --> 00:42:24,955
$13.75, right? Here's $1 4. KeeP the Change.

551
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:34,725
How's my favourite PeP-squad leader?

552
00:42:34,813 --> 00:42:35,850
What?

553
00:42:35,935 --> 00:42:38,087
l said, how's my favourite
PeP-squad leader?

554
00:42:38,177 --> 00:42:41,811
Not real PePPy.
Would somebody turn that musiC down?

555
00:42:42,663 --> 00:42:43,779
Hang on, CaP.

556
00:42:43,864 --> 00:42:45,857
ls there any more Pizza left?

557
00:42:49,951 --> 00:42:52,514
Somebody, Please turn that musiC off!

558
00:42:52,594 --> 00:42:54,109
Throw this away.

559
00:42:58,361 --> 00:43:01,755
l Cannot hear myself think.

560
00:43:04,488 --> 00:43:08,088
Okay, as we involuntarily enter
into this enforCed Period of silenCe...

561
00:43:08,173 --> 00:43:10,849
Can l ask if there's any mediCation
you forgot to take...

562
00:43:10,936 --> 00:43:12,929
or some l might reCommend you should try?

563
00:43:13,018 --> 00:43:15,137
Yes. Like take a Chill Pill.

564
00:43:15,341 --> 00:43:17,015
l only need one witness.

565
00:43:17,103 --> 00:43:18,253
Get out.

566
00:43:20,147 --> 00:43:21,263
What's uP, CaP?

567
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:24,628
lt's a subPoena from your buddy Zane.
The feds want our witnesses.

568
00:43:24,712 --> 00:43:26,865
We're noW offjcjally jn contempt.

569
00:43:26,955 --> 00:43:30,838
Don't worry. lf Cortland don't send
somebody to kill them soon, l'll do it myself.

570
00:43:30,919 --> 00:43:34,712
One other thing.
l got this invoiCe here for an air Conditioner.

571
00:43:34,804 --> 00:43:38,961
$7,572.44.

572
00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:40,165
Can you exPlain that to me?

573
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:42,084
l'll have to get baCk to you on that one.

574
00:43:42,173 --> 00:43:43,653
Where do you think you're going?

575
00:43:43,734 --> 00:43:45,967
To the CaCtus Cafe.
AsleeP at the Wheel's Playing.

576
00:43:46,057 --> 00:43:49,098
Too many PeoPle. You know the rules.
Nobody goes out after dark.

577
00:43:49,181 --> 00:43:52,256
We're young, we're strong,
and we're tired of being CooPed uP.

578
00:43:52,345 --> 00:43:55,067
l haven't had Phone sex with my boyfriend
in almost a week.

579
00:43:55,148 --> 00:43:56,298
l have oats to Plow.

580
00:43:56,389 --> 00:43:58,462
You got oats to sow,
and it ain't gonna haPPen.

581
00:43:58,552 --> 00:44:02,755
Like hell it's not. What's to stoP me
from walking out that door? The Tontos?

582
00:44:02,837 --> 00:44:04,511
l eat men like that for breakfast.

583
00:44:04,599 --> 00:44:08,073
And what, you?
l'd like to see you try it, Mr. Ranger-man.

584
00:44:10,246 --> 00:44:11,396
Come on.

585
00:44:25,904 --> 00:44:28,467
Anybody else wanna go see
AsleeP at the Wheel?

586
00:44:31,791 --> 00:44:33,784
You think he needs baCkuP?

587
00:44:34,795 --> 00:44:35,865
No.

588
00:44:36,677 --> 00:44:38,590
l think he Can handle it.

589
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:53,286
Let me guess, Clay.
You're looking for Jimmy.

590
00:44:55,098 --> 00:44:58,618
Totally. Dude, are you like a PsyChiC
or some kind of shit?

591
00:44:59,423 --> 00:45:01,017
Some kind of shit.

592
00:45:01,145 --> 00:45:02,580
The thing is...

593
00:45:02,868 --> 00:45:04,222
Jimmy moved.

594
00:45:04,549 --> 00:45:06,941
-Where to?
-Travis County Jailhouse.

595
00:45:07,753 --> 00:45:09,313
That ain't good.

596
00:45:16,323 --> 00:45:20,446
Okay, a hairdo this Phenomenal
only haPPens twiCe a year.

597
00:45:20,969 --> 00:45:23,850
Please. lt really needs to be shared
with the world.

598
00:45:23,932 --> 00:45:26,734
-What if we have to go to the bathroom?
-Go ahead.

599
00:45:26,856 --> 00:45:28,416
You're evil, you know that?

600
00:45:28,498 --> 00:45:30,695
FaCe it, girl. You're with me tonight.

601
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:32,420
We didn't ask for this.

602
00:45:32,502 --> 00:45:35,179
We just went into the bathroom
and saw a guy die.

603
00:45:35,266 --> 00:45:39,058
We Could've kePt quiet, but we didn't.
l feel like we're getting Punished for it.

604
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:42,351
-Sorry, but you're not being Punished.
-Then let us out of here.

605
00:45:42,434 --> 00:45:45,555
Even Prisoners on death row
get a little yard time.

606
00:45:45,878 --> 00:45:48,919
-How about the mall?
-ShoPPing with y'all? l don't think so.

607
00:45:49,002 --> 00:45:51,279
-What about a movie?
-Not in the mood.

608
00:45:51,365 --> 00:45:54,918
As CaPtain of the Cheerleading squad,
l demand that you take us somePlaCe...

609
00:45:55,009 --> 00:45:58,049
where you Can ProteCt us
and we Can have some fun.

610
00:46:24,443 --> 00:46:26,083
Look who's skating!

611
00:46:34,736 --> 00:46:38,130
Last time l was here, it was Emma's
sixth birthday. She loved this PlaCe.

612
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:40,019
You don't sPeak to her muCh, do you?

613
00:46:40,102 --> 00:46:41,822
l don't think Emma wants to talk to me.

614
00:46:41,904 --> 00:46:45,696
Every girl wants to talk to her dad.
She may aCt like she doesn't, but she does.

615
00:46:45,789 --> 00:46:49,422
Everything l say around her is wrong.
l've been wrong sinCe she turned 1 1 .

616
00:46:49,513 --> 00:46:52,349
Maybe you're just not asking her
the right questions.

617
00:46:52,436 --> 00:46:54,907
First of all, never ask, ''So how's sChool?''

618
00:46:54,999 --> 00:46:58,200
NoPe. Dumb question. lt's too easy.
Our brains just shut off.

619
00:46:58,283 --> 00:47:02,122
And don't beCome her best friend.
We have enough friends, thank you.

620
00:47:02,208 --> 00:47:03,882
What do you wish you Could say to her?

621
00:47:03,970 --> 00:47:05,963
That l wish l Could see her more...

622
00:47:06,052 --> 00:47:09,093
and l'm sorry it didn't work out
between her mother and me...

623
00:47:09,176 --> 00:47:12,012
and it wasn't her fault, and stuff like that.

624
00:47:12,099 --> 00:47:15,220
lf my daddy told me them things,
l'd be the haPPiest girl alive.

625
00:47:15,303 --> 00:47:17,866
l haven't seen my dad
sinCe he left me nine years ago.

626
00:47:17,946 --> 00:47:19,222
l'm sorry that haPPened to you.

627
00:47:19,308 --> 00:47:21,950
You have a daughter and you love her.
You should tell her.

628
00:47:22,031 --> 00:47:25,345
Yeah, maybe you should take her
skating again, beCause you know what?

629
00:47:25,435 --> 00:47:27,474
You're getting Pretty good.

630
00:47:27,798 --> 00:47:29,233
l am getting the hang of it.

631
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:33,477
All right, we're going to let you go.
Show us your funky groove. Come on, boy!

632
00:47:35,087 --> 00:47:37,478
All right! Yes, sir!

633
00:47:42,015 --> 00:47:44,247
-Are you okay?
-That was bad.

634
00:47:51,426 --> 00:47:52,860
Morning, Emma.

635
00:47:53,068 --> 00:47:54,218
Mr. Zane?

636
00:47:54,309 --> 00:47:56,302
Look at you, you're all grown uP.

637
00:47:56,392 --> 00:47:58,669
Yeah. Wow, it's been a long time.

638
00:47:58,754 --> 00:47:59,791
Sure has.

639
00:47:59,876 --> 00:48:00,912
What are you doing here?

640
00:48:00,997 --> 00:48:03,594
l'm looking for your father.
lt's a Professional matter.

641
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,479
You got any idea where l might find him?

642
00:48:05,562 --> 00:48:07,795
No. He doesn't really tell me anything.

643
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:09,559
What haPPened to your arm?

644
00:48:09,647 --> 00:48:12,244
lt's just one of the hazards of the job.

645
00:48:12,370 --> 00:48:14,933
You wouldn't haPPen
to have a number on him, would you?

646
00:48:15,013 --> 00:48:16,084
ls he in trouble?

647
00:48:16,175 --> 00:48:19,250
No. lt's just that l'm working on a Case
and l need his helP.

648
00:48:19,339 --> 00:48:21,093
lf l need to get ahold of him...

649
00:48:21,181 --> 00:48:24,973
l usually Call disPatCh and
they PatCh me through on a restriCted line.

650
00:48:25,065 --> 00:48:27,184
-l'll give that a try then.
-Okay.

651
00:48:27,268 --> 00:48:29,340
-Good to see you again.
-Bye.

652
00:48:33,796 --> 00:48:35,355
SharP, look here.

653
00:48:35,958 --> 00:48:38,954
Remember that John Doe
they Pulled out of a rest stoP last week?

654
00:48:39,042 --> 00:48:42,037
Rifle from his trunk matChes the bullet
they dug out of Swanson.

655
00:48:42,125 --> 00:48:44,722
ls this the fella y'all see shoot Morgan Ball?

656
00:48:45,129 --> 00:48:47,930
No. The guy who shot Ball
seemed a lot niCer.

657
00:48:48,012 --> 00:48:49,527
And a lot less dead.

658
00:48:49,614 --> 00:48:51,926
-lt was like Ball knew him or something.
-Knew him?

659
00:48:52,017 --> 00:48:55,696
Yeah. lf you're through Playing deteCtive,
Can you get us home so we Can rest?

660
00:48:55,781 --> 00:48:56,818
NoPe.

00:48:56,903 --> 00:48:58,223
-Please?
-Come on.

662
00:48:58,425 --> 00:48:59,575
Load uP.

663
00:49:17,527 --> 00:49:21,411
Yeah, l like that.
That's where we're gonna kill them.

664
00:49:22,733 --> 00:49:25,489
Remind me to take a ColleCtion
right after that.

665
00:49:25,576 --> 00:49:28,139
That's gonna be a good time
to get the money.

666
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:30,737
Well, if it ain't Martin Luther Vandross.

667
00:49:30,823 --> 00:49:34,102
Why don't you all take a break.
Everybody go ahead, real quiCk.

668
00:49:34,187 --> 00:49:37,148
This man's Probably got
a lot of sins he needs to Confess.

669
00:49:37,230 --> 00:49:38,950
Probably may have to exorCise him.

670
00:49:39,032 --> 00:49:41,151
Y'all go about your business.

671
00:49:42,196 --> 00:49:44,109
Can't you see

672
00:49:44,198 --> 00:49:45,792
You know this guy?

He work for Cortland?

679
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:05,543

680
00:50:05,624 --> 00:50:08,346
if you know what l'm saying.

681
00:50:09,869 --> 00:50:14,629
Looks like Cortland hired a seCond shooter.

''Hot, now show us what you got''

The Cheerleaders?

739
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:10,977
You are a Curious fella, Mr. SharP. You gay?

740
00:55:11,063 --> 00:55:13,455
No. Girls are all tied uP, studying.

746
00:55:24,398 --> 00:55:27,439
-Negative?
-lt's not really Possible, with work and all.

00:55:28,323 --> 00:55:31,364
Well, okay, that Plane just flew

748
00:55:31,447 --> 00:55:34,682

Didn't want the wings after all?

755
00:56:10,853 --> 00:56:13,529
No. ln regard to dinner.
lt's not that l don't want to.

756
00:56:13,616 --> 00:56:16,133
lt's hard for me to get away
with my busy sChedule...

757
00:56:16,219 --> 00:56:19,021
as an assistant Cheerleading CoaCh.

758
00:56:19,583 --> 00:56:22,818
This whole Cheerleading thing
must be a really tough raCket.

759
00:56:22,907 --> 00:56:24,467
You have no idea.

760
00:56:24,870 --> 00:56:26,145
Anyway, l was thinking...

761
00:56:26,231 --> 00:56:29,910

762
00:56:35,122 --> 00:56:36,192

769
00:57:09,963 --> 00:57:14,200
No. l think that's an airPlane.
You see the way it's moving?

770
00:57:15,489 --> 00:57:17,243
That's the North Star.

771
00:57:17,812 --> 00:57:20,204
So that's where they've been keePing it.

772
00:57:21,256 --> 00:57:23,773
Someday l want to do more
than look at the stars.

773
00:57:23,859 --> 00:57:25,977
l'm fixing to soar with them.

774
00:57:26,222 --> 00:57:28,819
What, you mean,

775
00:57:28,905 --> 00:57:32,185
No, not exaCtly. Not a living one, at least.

776
00:57:32,669 --> 00:57:34,947
They got this ComPany out of Beaumont...

00:57:59,421 --> 00:58:03,544
lt's suPPosed to be red.
Does this look like red to you?

783
00:58:03,706 --> 00:58:06,587
Just shoot her, SharP.
You'd be doing her a favour.

784
00:58:06,910 --> 00:58:09,301
-Where are Teresa and Anne?
-l don't know.

785
00:58:09,392 --> 00:58:10,747

-How do you know?
-You broke eye ContaCt.

787
00:58:13,397 --> 00:58:15,550
lt's a sign of stress and Possible deCePtion.

788
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:18,476
So is PiCking at your Clothes.
StoP PiCking at your Clothes.

789
00:58:18,563 --> 00:58:20,716
Look me in the eye
and tell me where they're at.

790
00:58:20,806 --> 00:58:22,719
Teresa and Antonio had a really big fight.

791
00:58:22,808 --> 00:58:26,601
She had to blow off some steam,
so they went to the Buffalo Billiards.

792
00:58:27,774 --> 00:58:28,890
You stay here.

793
00:58:28,975 --> 00:58:31,698
Don't be ContemPlating the universe

Look, a native aPProaChes.

01:01:10,325 --> 01:01:12,967
You're not really the Cheerleading tyPe,
are you?

832
01:01:13,048 --> 01:01:15,360
For me, it's more PenanCe than a Passion.

833
01:01:15,451 --> 01:01:18,686
Religious asCetiCs wear a hair shirt,
l Carry the Pom-Poms.

834
01:01:19,136 --> 01:01:20,570
l don't know.

835
01:01:21,338 --> 01:01:24,060
l guess it's the duality of man, you know?

836
01:01:24,382 --> 01:01:26,340
''That Jungian thing, sir.''

837
01:01:26,584 --> 01:01:28,418
Matthew Modine, Full Metal Jacket.

838
01:01:28,507 --> 01:01:31,661
PeaCe sign on one side of his helmet,
''Born to Kill'' on the other.

839
01:01:31,750 --> 01:01:33,390
lt's my favourite movie.

840
01:01:35,795 --> 01:01:38,392
My favourite movie is The Sound of Musjc.

841
01:01:44,886 --> 01:01:46,446
''What's in a name?

842
01:01:46,808 --> 01:01:50,852
''that whiCh we Call a rose
By any other name would smell as sweet''

843
01:01:51,454 --> 01:01:53,013
l don't understand any of this.

844
01:01:53,096 --> 01:01:56,615
Pretty simPle, really.
She's a CaPulet, he's a Montague.

845
01:01:56,700 --> 01:02:01,017
The two families have always hated eaCh
other and they always will hate eaCh other.

846
01:02:01,105 --> 01:02:04,340
-Why Couldn't ShakesPeare say it like that?
-He Could have.

847
01:02:04,429 --> 01:02:07,185
But nobody would be talking about it
410 years later.

848
01:02:07,272 --> 01:02:09,470
How do you know so muCh
about Romeo and Juljet?

849
01:02:09,555 --> 01:02:10,545
l read the Play.

850
01:02:10,636 --> 01:02:13,996
-Why would you read the Play?
-Molly's Coming over for dinner tonight.

851
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:15,116
Who's Molly?

852
01:02:15,202 --> 01:02:16,636
Professor MCCarthy.

853
01:02:16,723 --> 01:02:18,078
You Call her Molly?

854
01:02:18,165 --> 01:02:21,126
This whole house totally reeks.
What is that smell?

855
01:02:21,209 --> 01:02:23,931
Five Alarm Chili. lt's my sPeCialty.

856
01:02:24,452 --> 01:02:26,889
You're Putting meat into my lentil Pot?

857
01:02:27,176 --> 01:02:28,816
He's making dinner for Molly.

858
01:02:28,898 --> 01:02:30,218
Who's Molly?

859
01:02:30,299 --> 01:02:32,497
Professor MCCarthy, lntro to English Lit.

860
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:36,056
l had her last quarter. She's a babe.
And this is what you're serving her?

861
01:02:36,146 --> 01:02:37,467
lt's his sPeCialty.

862
01:02:37,548 --> 01:02:38,868
My wife loved my Chili.

863
01:02:38,949 --> 01:02:41,307
Your wife left your gassy old ass.

864
01:02:41,392 --> 01:02:43,863
-What's going on?
-SharP's got a date.

865
01:02:49,562 --> 01:02:51,043
-What are you gonna wear?
-Clothes.

866
01:02:51,124 --> 01:02:53,162
-Pants, sPort Coat.
-Not that butt-ugly thing.

867
01:02:53,246 --> 01:02:54,282
l like that sPort Coat.

868
01:02:54,368 --> 01:02:55,802
l grabbed everything l Could find.

869
01:02:55,889 --> 01:02:58,247
What Comes first,
astringent or exfoliating lotion?

870
01:02:58,332 --> 01:02:59,368
l don't use that stuff.

871
01:02:59,454 --> 01:03:01,367
You've got Pores
the size of manhole Covers.

872
01:03:01,456 --> 01:03:05,420
And the ears, the nose.
We better do something about all this hair.

873
01:03:05,501 --> 01:03:07,573
You Can use some bronzer.
You need some Colour.

874
01:03:07,663 --> 01:03:10,260
-l don't bronze.
-You'll bronze, white boy.

875
01:03:10,346 --> 01:03:14,060
l have been suCCessfully grooming myself
for longer than y'all have been alive.

876
01:03:14,151 --> 01:03:16,189
Some things have Changed
sinCe you were young.

877
01:03:16,273 --> 01:03:18,506
We've disCovered fire and the wheel.

878

01:03:21,479 --> 01:03:22,630
l'm just having dinner.

880
01:03:22,721 --> 01:03:26,161
Not looking like that you won't.
Barb, Can you do anything with the hair?

881
01:03:26,245 --> 01:03:27,566
Shave it all off.

882
01:03:27,647 --> 01:03:29,526
Go talk to her. Give me that.

883
01:03:32,532 --> 01:03:36,576
Come on. l mean, it's never gonna work out
between you and SharP.

884
01:03:36,657 --> 01:03:38,776
He's old enough to be your...

885
01:03:39,140 --> 01:03:42,979
great-great-great-great grandfather.

886
01:03:43,585 --> 01:03:47,549
And you have an oPPortunity to helP him.
You went to beauty sChool.

887
01:03:48,111 --> 01:03:49,545
l flunked out.

888
01:03:49,993 --> 01:03:51,143
l know.

889
01:03:51,835 --> 01:03:53,270
But he doesn't know that.

890
01:04:08,094 --> 01:04:10,213
''Natural-looking dramatiC highlights...

891
01:04:10,297 --> 01:04:13,178
''that enhanCe and brighten
your natural hair Colour.''

892
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:14,490
-Yes.
-No.

893
01:04:25,555 --> 01:04:29,154
Okay, let's foCus on the Conversation.
How are you gonna get things rolling?

894
01:04:29,239 --> 01:04:30,229
l don't know.

895
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:32,553
lt's been a long time
sinCe l went out on a date.

896
01:04:32,643 --> 01:04:35,719
That's okay.
Look, just give us a little Preview.

897
01:04:36,928 --> 01:04:38,079

898
01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:39,525
l Come in.

899
01:04:39,932 --> 01:04:40,922
Go.

900
01:04:41,013 --> 01:04:43,291
Well, l'll start out by saying ''hello.''

901
01:04:43,376 --> 01:04:44,936
No, l'll say ''hi.''

902
01:04:46,099 --> 01:04:48,171
No, ''hello'' is better. l think.

903
01:04:48,262 --> 01:04:50,175
l'll wait and see how l feel at the time.

904
01:04:50,264 --> 01:04:52,735
Then l'll Probably start out saying....

905
01:04:53,388 --> 01:04:55,381
Asking her if she ever....

906
01:04:59,915 --> 01:05:02,034
We'll start talking about....

907
01:05:05,001 --> 01:05:06,914

908
01:05:11,529 --> 01:05:12,804
Who knew you were suCh a babe?

909
01:05:12,890 --> 01:05:14,884
Even if you didn't let us frost your tiPs.

910
01:05:14,973 --> 01:05:16,613
You Clean uP Pretty niCe, Sergeant.

911
01:05:16,695 --> 01:05:19,212
-You're all that and then some.
-Thank you.

912
01:05:19,298 --> 01:05:21,769
Remember, a woman is like a horse.

913
01:05:21,861 --> 01:05:24,937
She likes the guy on the saddle
to have a tight griP on the reins.

914
01:05:25,025 --> 01:05:28,260
ExCuse me, a woman is not a horse.
Just be yourself.

915
01:05:28,349 --> 01:05:31,185
l'm not so sure being himself
is going in the right direCtion.

916
01:05:31,272 --> 01:05:34,791
Okay. Just be yourself,
but not the you who you really are.

917
01:05:34,876 --> 01:05:37,599
Be the you who you would be
if you were somebody else.

918
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:40,402
-Somebody better.
-That's what l mean. Somebody better.

919
01:05:40,483 --> 01:05:42,282
-Maybe we ought to Call this off.
-Okay.

920
01:05:42,365 --> 01:05:43,355
No!

921
01:05:43,847 --> 01:05:46,569
lt's too late.
Okay, just don't be the sChizoid SharP.

922
01:05:46,650 --> 01:05:48,848
Be the SharP who embraCes life.

923
01:05:53,819 --> 01:05:56,973
Now, don't worry.
We'll be with you every steP of the way.

924
01:05:57,102 --> 01:06:00,702
Sgt. Holt Provided us
with a sPare set of eyes and ears.

925
01:06:01,548 --> 01:06:03,062
Can you hear me?

926
01:06:03,470 --> 01:06:05,144
Can you hear me now?

927
01:06:06,313 --> 01:06:08,227
-Out of here!
-Sorry.

928
01:06:09,958 --> 01:06:11,996
Just take these.

929
01:06:16,445 --> 01:06:17,481
Get!

930
01:06:24,094 --> 01:06:25,245
Hello.

931
01:06:25,576 --> 01:06:26,726
Come in.

932
01:06:38,391 --> 01:06:40,270
Tell her she looks niCe.

933
01:06:42,075 --> 01:06:43,510
You look niCe.

934
01:06:43,677 --> 01:06:46,069
Thank you. So do you.

935
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:47,841
Nifty jaCket.

936
01:06:49,804 --> 01:06:51,319
Give her the flowers.

937
01:06:51,406 --> 01:06:52,966
Girls thought you might like those.

938
01:06:53,048 --> 01:06:54,529
No, they were your idea.

939
01:06:54,610 --> 01:06:58,323
They're my idea,
but the girls thought you might like those.

940
01:06:59,536 --> 01:07:01,290
Well, they were right.

941
01:07:02,259 --> 01:07:04,013
-They're not here, are they?
-No.

942
01:07:04,101 --> 01:07:06,174
Good. That would have been
a little awkward.

943
01:07:06,264 --> 01:07:07,858
Yes. Real aWkWard.

944
01:07:08,987 --> 01:07:10,422
Take the wine.

945
01:07:10,909 --> 01:07:12,060
Take jt.

946
01:07:12,391 --> 01:07:14,224
l'll just go oPen this.

947
01:07:23,925 --> 01:07:25,484
Where do you keeP the CorksCrew?

948
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:27,685
Left of the sink, toP drawer.

949
01:07:39,183 --> 01:07:40,253
Look.

950
01:07:40,344 --> 01:07:43,339
Base to Ranger One, we've got
a makeuP CheCk in the dining room.

951
01:07:43,428 --> 01:07:46,548
-I repeat, makeup check jn the djnjng room.
-What does that mean?

952
01:07:46,631 --> 01:07:49,513
lt means she digs you, man.
Now, loosen the hell uP.

953
01:07:58,605 --> 01:07:59,881
Thank you.

954
01:08:00,928 --> 01:08:01,918
Root beer.

955
01:08:02,009 --> 01:08:04,162
l gave uP alCohol about 10 years ago.

956
01:08:04,252 --> 01:08:06,485
Didn't like yourself
when you were drinking, huh?

957
01:08:06,575 --> 01:08:10,653
Hell, l loved myself when l drank.
lt was other PeoPle that had the Problem.

958
01:08:12,141 --> 01:08:13,292
He's a dork.

959
01:08:17,988 --> 01:08:20,664
Well, why don't l Put these in some water.

960
01:08:22,473 --> 01:08:26,676
All right, look, you got a laugh.
Now go to the table and light the Candles.

961
01:08:26,758 --> 01:08:28,991
No, that's suCh a lame move.

962
01:08:29,081 --> 01:08:30,755
Candles are a total cljche.

963
01:08:30,843 --> 01:08:33,280
What do you knoW about cljches?
You've got a Waterbed.

964
01:08:33,366 --> 01:08:35,439
l say, light the Candle. lt's sexy.

965
01:08:35,529 --> 01:08:39,573
He mjght as Well pull out the bearskjn rug
and the djsco ball, for God's sake.

966
01:08:39,654 --> 01:08:41,054
l need Confirmation.

967
01:08:41,135 --> 01:08:44,211
Is ljghtjng the candle
a cool move or not a cool move?

968
01:08:44,299 --> 01:08:45,335
Fine.

969
01:08:46,181 --> 01:08:47,536
All in favour of Candles?

970
01:08:47,623 --> 01:08:49,536
-Me.
-OPPosed?

971
01:08:51,147 --> 01:08:54,029
Mission Control to SharP.
Light those Candles.

972
01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:02,760
I don't knoW.

973
01:09:03,001 --> 01:09:07,522
So many of my colleagues just stjck jt out
for the paycheque and the benefjts.

974
01:09:08,087 --> 01:09:10,285
Or, in my ex-husband's Case...

975
01:09:10,370 --> 01:09:13,571
for the endless suPPly
of fresh, young Co-eds.

976
01:09:13,814 --> 01:09:17,447
Why would a man want to be with a girl
when he Can be with a woman?

977
01:09:17,819 --> 01:09:20,814
Or in your Case, with five girls.

978
01:09:22,104 --> 01:09:23,778
What is your story?

979
01:09:24,506 --> 01:09:26,545
My work beCame my mistress.

980
01:09:27,510 --> 01:09:29,981
Before l knew it, that was all l had.

981
01:09:49,496 --> 01:09:50,930
Willie Nelson.

982
01:09:54,382 --> 01:09:56,215
Man after my own heart.

983
01:09:58,146 --> 01:09:59,740
You want to danCe?

984
01:10:12,723 --> 01:10:14,956
So, what's really going on here?

985
01:10:19,091 --> 01:10:20,241
DanCing.

986
01:10:22,535 --> 01:10:24,493
No, l mean here.

987
01:10:25,738 --> 01:10:28,575
What is a man like you doing in this house?

988
01:10:30,344 --> 01:10:31,778
Well, it's...

989
01:10:33,107 --> 01:10:34,940
a temPorary assignment.

990
01:10:37,392 --> 01:10:41,549
And l venture to guess it has nothing
to do with Cheerleading, does it?

991
01:10:41,717 --> 01:10:43,118
Not muCh, no.

992
01:10:44,561 --> 01:10:46,474
lt's kind of ComPliCated.

993
01:10:51,689 --> 01:10:53,761
You want to go in the living room?

994
01:10:56,775 --> 01:10:57,845
Yeah.

995
01:11:02,381 --> 01:11:05,263
Gross. What are you gonna do,
bag her on the CouCh?

996
01:11:15,957 --> 01:11:18,520
Good njght, Barb. Do your homeWork.

997
01:11:19,802 --> 01:11:21,522
l Can still see you.

998
01:11:26,049 --> 01:11:27,643
You're killing me.

999
01:11:46,513 --> 01:11:47,630
Hello?

1000
01:11:48,035 --> 01:11:51,395

1014
01:12:50,068 --> 01:12:52,460
-What are y'all doing?
-Getting PumPed for Hex Rally.

1015
01:12:52,551 --> 01:12:54,305
-We'll have to nix the Hex Rally.
-What?

1016
01:12:54,393 --> 01:12:57,389
No. There's no nixing the Hex.
lt must go on.

1017
01:12:57,477 --> 01:12:59,470
You Can't stoP the Hex, Mr. Ranger-man.

1018
01:12:59,559 --> 01:13:01,473
-lt's bigger than all of us.
-ls that right?

1019
01:13:01,562 --> 01:13:06,197
lf we were doCtors, we'd Cure CanCer.
lf we were nurses, we'd give PeoPle shots.

1020
01:13:06,487 --> 01:13:10,326
lf we were astronauts,
we would do other things.

1021
01:13:10,452 --> 01:13:14,530
But we're not. We're Cheerleaders.
And we're going to the Hex Rally.

1022
01:13:14,977 --> 01:13:17,369
-You don't resPeCt Cheerleading, do you?
-No.

1023
01:13:17,460 --> 01:13:19,454
That's beCause you still don't get it.

1024
01:13:19,543 --> 01:13:22,185
Samuel L. JaCkson, Sandra BulloCk,
Cameron Diaz...

1025
01:13:22,266 --> 01:13:24,544

1026
01:13:24,629 --> 01:13:28,626
Not to mention Franklin D. Roosevelt,
Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush...

1027
01:13:28,714 --> 01:13:31,356
and the governor of our fair state,
RiCk Perry.

1028
01:13:31,437 --> 01:13:32,553
All Cheerleaders.

1029
01:13:32,638 --> 01:13:36,602
See, you're a negative Person, SharP.
Cheerleading is all about the Positive.

1030
01:13:36,683 --> 01:13:40,362
Our job is to insPire, suPPort and eleCtrify.

1031
01:13:40,447 --> 01:13:42,327
Any fool Can feel good
when you're winning.

1032
01:13:42,410 --> 01:13:45,007
But when you're down 27 Points
in the fourth quarter...

1033
01:13:45,093 --> 01:13:48,294
that's when you got to ask yourself,
''Who you gonna Call?''

1034
01:13:52,141 --> 01:13:54,054
l might Call Halle Berry.

1035
01:14:34,751 --> 01:14:38,749
Hey, Longhorns.

1048
01:15:31,458 --> 01:15:32,778
All rjght.

We got to hojst them hjgh...

1056

to put them on a platform of posjtjvjty.

1057
01:16:00,132 --> 01:16:02,204
Any fool can feel good
When you're Wjnnjng.

1058
01:16:02,294 --> 01:16:04,970
But When you're doWn 27 pojnts
jn the fourth quarter...

1059
01:16:05,057 --> 01:16:08,212
you got to ask yourself,
''Who you gonna call?''

1060
01:16:08,381 --> 01:16:12,220
I tell you Who I'm gojng to call,
and that's these ladjes rjght here.

1061
01:16:12,306 --> 01:16:15,382
They're the most spjrjted group
of young ladjes I've ever seen...

1062
01:16:15,470 --> 01:16:19,387
or had a chance to get to knoW and
had the prjvjlege of comjng jn contact Wjth.

1063
01:16:19,474 --> 01:16:22,071
Prajse the Lord and pass the ammunjtjon!

1064
01:16:39,218 --> 01:16:42,578
Okay, now Can l get a witness?
This man has got the sPirit.

1065
01:16:42,662 --> 01:16:45,657
Swear to God, l thought
he was gonna start sPeaking in tongues.

1066
01:16:45,745 --> 01:16:47,739
What about ''Platform of Positivity''?

1067
01:16:47,828 --> 01:16:51,461
l was gonna do a Cartwheel,
but didn't want to steal the limelight.

1068
01:16:53,474 --> 01:16:55,068
l think SharP just made a joke.

1069
01:16:55,156 --> 01:16:57,719
lt's more of a jaPe or a jest,
but still, it's Progress.

1070
01:16:57,799 --> 01:17:00,191
-Can we go to the Party?
-Negatjvo, baby.

1071
01:17:01,003 --> 01:17:04,762
Please. When are you guys
gonna get over yourselves?

1072
01:17:04,888 --> 01:17:07,849

Get down!

1079
01:17:42,212 --> 01:17:44,968
Okay, maybe somebody is trying to kill us.

1080
01:17:48,018 --> 01:17:50,091
How did they, like, find us?

1081
01:17:50,181 --> 01:17:51,855
They looked for us.

1082
01:17:52,624 --> 01:17:54,982
-What about Emma?
-She doesn't know where l am.

1083
01:17:55,067 --> 01:17:58,666
Yes, sir, she does.
She Called last night on the house Phone.

1084
01:18:00,073 --> 01:18:02,031
She was returning my Call.

1085
01:18:02,195 --> 01:18:03,869
Was that a mistake?

1086
01:18:07,041 --> 01:18:08,442
Get them uPstairs.

1087
01:18:08,563 --> 01:18:10,157
