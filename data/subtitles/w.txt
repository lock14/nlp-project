2
00:01:31,922 --> 00:01:32,965
<i>And now...</i>

3
00:01:33,048 --> 00:01:34,425
<i>...ladies and gentlemen...</i>

4
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:38,470
<i>...the 43rd
president of the United States...</i>

5
00:01:38,596 --> 00:01:41,599
<i>...George W. Bush.</i>

6
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:00,576
- Axis of Hatred?
- I know.

7
00:02:00,701 --> 00:02:02,369
Something about it...

8
00:02:02,494 --> 00:02:04,580
- ... just misses.
- Any other brilliant ideas?

9
00:02:05,998 --> 00:02:07,249
How about Axis of Weasels?

10
00:02:07,374 --> 00:02:09,335
Don't get cute, Karl.
This is serious now.

11
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,003
I think it needs to be stronger.

12
00:02:11,128 --> 00:02:14,757
Just cut through the noise. Like
Reagan with the "Evil Empire" speech.

13
00:02:14,882 --> 00:02:16,842
Well, is it too much then to...?

14
00:02:18,927 --> 00:02:20,304
What about Axis of Evil?

15
00:02:20,512 --> 00:02:22,181
Axis of Evil?

16
00:02:22,264 --> 00:02:26,018
Evil? Yeah, I like the ring of that.
That's good.

17
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:29,772
Mr. President,
"axis" brings up World War II.

18
00:02:29,897 --> 00:02:33,025
You can't link Germany and Japan
with Iraq and North Korea.

19
00:02:33,067 --> 00:02:35,110
No, I... I disagree, Colin.

20
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:38,322
Weapons of mass destruction make
these countries more dangerous.

21
00:02:38,364 --> 00:02:42,409
We gotta begin educating the public
about this war and its implications.

22
00:02:42,534 --> 00:02:45,412
You have an approval rating
of more than 80 percent now.

23
00:02:45,454 --> 00:02:47,956
It's just astounding.

24
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,334
Not since Roosevelt
after Pearl Harbor.

25
00:02:50,876 --> 00:02:54,505
The American people want revenge.
They liked Afghanistan.

26
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:57,007
They want more.

27
00:02:57,216 --> 00:02:59,385
Mr. President, if I may?

28
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:01,595
Given your strong commitment
to democracy...

29
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,515
...do you think that Iran
should be lumped together...

30
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,183
...with Iraq and North Korea?

31
00:03:06,266 --> 00:03:09,395
After all, Iran has
a democratically elected president.

32
00:03:10,145 --> 00:03:12,439
- As always, Guru, sharp.
- Thank you.

33
00:03:12,523 --> 00:03:17,194
Iran is not Iraq and Iraq is not Iran.
I know that.

34
00:03:17,236 --> 00:03:20,989
If we can get one democracy going
in one of these places, Iran, Iraq?

35
00:03:21,073 --> 00:03:24,118
Reagan was right. It's gonna spread
to all these countries...

36
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,577
...because people want freedom.

37
00:03:25,786 --> 00:03:29,123
With this message, we're sending
strong word to reformers in Iran...

38
00:03:29,164 --> 00:03:31,083
...to turn on these deadbeat
dead-enders...

39
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:34,211
...these ayatollah cockamamies.
Iran stays in.

40
00:03:34,253 --> 00:03:36,755
When you make threats, sir,
you have to back them up.

41
00:03:36,839 --> 00:03:38,590
You'd be committing us
to planning...

42
00:03:38,841 --> 00:03:41,635
...three fully operational wars
with three countries.

43
00:03:41,677 --> 00:03:44,430
No, I'm not saying war.
I'm saying lay down the law.

44
00:03:44,555 --> 00:03:48,183
But the speech as written
is taking a preemptive posture...

45
00:03:48,308 --> 00:03:50,936
...against countries,
none of whom declared war on us.

46
00:03:51,019 --> 00:03:53,397
For 60 years now, this country...

47
00:03:53,438 --> 00:03:55,941
...has operated under a principle
of containment.

48
00:03:56,024 --> 00:03:58,318
That's a defense, general,
not an offense.

49
00:03:58,443 --> 00:04:00,821
How are you gonna contain
100,000 lunatics...

50
00:04:00,946 --> 00:04:02,781
...running around
with fake passports...

51
00:04:03,031 --> 00:04:06,118
...from country to country,
looking for nukes, anthrax?

52
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,288
Containment don't hold water
as far as I'm concerned.

53
00:04:09,371 --> 00:04:11,540
We're gonna get hit again.
We all know that.

54
00:04:11,665 --> 00:04:14,585
Unless we go out there,
hit them hard, and we hit them first.

55
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:16,545
Well,
containment won us the Cold War.

56
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:19,882
Some people might just say that
Reagan won the Cold War, general.

57
00:04:20,007 --> 00:04:22,301
And it started
with the "Empire of Evil" speech.

58
00:04:22,384 --> 00:04:23,468
What do you think?

59
00:04:23,635 --> 00:04:27,389
Oh, Mr. President, you know I don't
do nuance. It's just not my thing.

60
00:04:28,473 --> 00:04:30,559
I'll keep to the big picture
if you don't mind.

61
00:04:30,726 --> 00:04:33,228
I do. Brother George?

62
00:04:33,353 --> 00:04:34,605
Think?

63
00:04:34,813 --> 00:04:39,193
Well, actually there's about 80,000 of
them, terrorists, in about 80 countries.

64
00:04:39,234 --> 00:04:40,569
My point exactly.

65
00:04:40,652 --> 00:04:43,989
And I'm sure you realize, of course,
what complicates things is...

66
00:04:44,072 --> 00:04:46,158
...it wasn't Iran or Iraq
who attacked us.

67
00:04:46,283 --> 00:04:48,577
It was Osama bin Laden.

68
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:51,705
I know it was bin Laden, George.
You know as well as I do...

69
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,999
...there's more terrorists out there...

70
00:04:54,082 --> 00:04:56,168
...than a religious nut
in a cave in Pakistan.

71
00:04:56,418 --> 00:05:00,255
- Wolfie, you got that look on your face.
- Well, sir, to get back to the point...

72
00:05:00,297 --> 00:05:02,341
...Iran is the issue here.

73
00:05:02,549 --> 00:05:05,344
It is the mothership of terrorism.

74
00:05:06,303 --> 00:05:07,763
Vice?

75
00:05:09,431 --> 00:05:14,937
Sir, as you know, I don't view
this issue as a matter of choice.

76
00:05:15,187 --> 00:05:17,856
<i>Since 9/11, there's no going back.</i>

77
00:05:27,032 --> 00:05:28,700
Well, then...

78
00:05:29,451 --> 00:05:32,079
- ... we'll go with Axis of Evil.
- Yes, Mr. President.

79
00:05:32,162 --> 00:05:33,830
And now I'm tired of this sentence.

80
00:05:34,748 --> 00:05:38,335
All right, before we go,
let's all take a moment.

81
00:05:39,127 --> 00:05:41,004
You too, turdblossom.

82
00:06:00,732 --> 00:06:03,944
Do infants enjoy infancy...

83
00:06:04,152 --> 00:06:07,739
...as much as adults enjoy adultery?

84
00:06:14,996 --> 00:06:16,665
Let's go. Go.

85
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:20,335
Why do kamikaze pilots
wear seat belts?

86
00:06:20,377 --> 00:06:21,670
Because the Japs are crazy.

87
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:26,174
That's wrong. And you all suffer.

88
00:06:27,342 --> 00:06:29,845
Buxenhall,
you worthless piece of horseshit.

89
00:06:29,928 --> 00:06:31,596
Sing "The Whiffenpoof Song. "

90
00:06:44,943 --> 00:06:47,028
- I can't hear you.
- Louder.

91
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:50,699
Yeah.

92
00:06:54,619 --> 00:06:56,121
Lovely.

93
00:06:56,288 --> 00:06:58,081
So...

94
00:06:58,206 --> 00:07:00,584
- ... enjoying ourselves, I see.
- Yeah.

95
00:07:02,377 --> 00:07:08,508
Good evening, young fellow
Delta Kappsters in waiting.

96
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,177
This is pledge week.

97
00:07:10,385 --> 00:07:13,388
If you make the grade,
you'll become a brother.

98
00:07:14,139 --> 00:07:17,392
Delta Kappa brothers
are men of honor...

99
00:07:17,475 --> 00:07:18,935
...decency...

100
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,395
...and God-given character.

101
00:07:20,604 --> 00:07:22,689
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

102
00:07:22,814 --> 00:07:26,735
That, along with our family fortunes, is
why we rule the world. Right, Jimmy?

103
00:07:27,068 --> 00:07:28,236
Right.

104
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,487
But...

105
00:07:29,654 --> 00:07:32,282
...until you are Delta Kappsters...

106
00:07:32,407 --> 00:07:34,910
...you are all still pieces of garbage.

107
00:07:35,493 --> 00:07:36,870
You, Buxenhall, quick.

108
00:07:36,995 --> 00:07:38,747
How many of these brothers
do you know?

109
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,916
Name every brother in this room.
Now.

110
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:42,083
Dieter...

111
00:07:42,709 --> 00:07:46,755
...Hotchkiss, Austin, Hill, Coors.

112
00:07:48,965 --> 00:07:50,342
- No good.
- Sanders...

113
00:07:50,425 --> 00:07:54,387
Seven. Seven out of 40. That's it?

114
00:07:54,512 --> 00:07:56,473
Maybe you'll remember better
with a drink.

115
00:07:57,098 --> 00:07:58,767
Yeah!

116
00:08:03,355 --> 00:08:04,606
And what about you?

117
00:08:04,814 --> 00:08:07,067
You think you can do any better,
Mister Pussy?

118
00:08:07,108 --> 00:08:09,277
- Yes, sir.
- Are you ready for your bath?

119
00:08:09,527 --> 00:08:10,779
I think I can do better.

120
00:08:10,862 --> 00:08:12,864
Let's hear.

121
00:08:12,948 --> 00:08:14,824
"Cape Cod" Cartner...

122
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:17,118
...Scotty "Scotch and soda"
Sonnenberg...

123
00:08:17,327 --> 00:08:19,412
...Paul "Putting-on-the-Rich"
Richardson...

124
00:08:19,955 --> 00:08:22,040
...Jackie "Jambalaya" Jackson...

125
00:08:22,123 --> 00:08:23,792
...Paul "Poodle" Johnson...

126
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,545
...Marky "Pit Bull" Phillips,
Ollie "Octopus" Givens...

127
00:08:27,587 --> 00:08:29,005
...John "Cranky" Olinger...

128
00:08:29,214 --> 00:08:33,385
...Sammy "Sloppy Seconds" Woods,
Jeremiah "Crusher" Adams...

129
00:08:33,426 --> 00:08:35,387
...Howie "Gringo" Givens...

130
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:36,805
...Adam "Lazy" Greenwood...

131
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:41,810
- We have got a working brain here.
- Yeah.

132
00:08:41,851 --> 00:08:44,020
He may be from Texas...

133
00:08:44,145 --> 00:08:46,731
...but he's gonna be
one great Delta Kappster.

134
00:08:46,815 --> 00:08:49,317
Sir, I'm working for that.

135
00:08:50,694 --> 00:08:51,736
You legacy?

136
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:55,281
Yeah, father, grandfather, all the way
back to great, great grandfather.

137
00:08:55,407 --> 00:08:57,659
Yeah, for any ignoramuses
who don't know...

138
00:08:57,784 --> 00:08:59,577
...his grandfather Prescott...

139
00:08:59,661 --> 00:09:01,955
...is our esteemed senator
from Connecticut.

140
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,040
My father's running for Congress
in Texas.

141
00:09:04,165 --> 00:09:05,083
Yeah.

142
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:07,919
Planning on following
in their footsteps there, Bushie?

143
00:09:08,002 --> 00:09:12,173
Hell, no. No way in the world
I'd wanna do that.

144
00:09:15,427 --> 00:09:17,679
Congressman George Bush.

145
00:09:17,804 --> 00:09:20,181
May I please speak with my son?

146
00:09:24,477 --> 00:09:28,106
- Daddy's on the phone.
- Hey, tell your mom I said hi.

147
00:09:28,231 --> 00:09:31,985
- Wait here. I'll be right back.
- Help us out here, Bush.

148
00:09:32,819 --> 00:09:35,113
- I'll be right back.
- Don't forget about us.

149
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,331
Hello, Pop. Is that you?

150
00:09:45,457 --> 00:09:47,292
What's this about?

151
00:09:47,417 --> 00:09:48,960
What kind of trouble you in now?

152
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:51,296
<i>Oh, it's penny ante. I swear, Poppy.</i>

153
00:09:51,379 --> 00:09:52,839
Hey, we beat Princeton.

154
00:09:52,964 --> 00:09:54,507
Won the darn championship.

155
00:09:54,632 --> 00:09:57,719
We were tearing down the goal posts.
I was hanging on the crossbar.

156
00:09:57,844 --> 00:10:01,598
But they arrested me on account of
me being head cheerleader, I'm sure.

157
00:10:02,015 --> 00:10:05,643
<i>Hill and Dowling had great games.
I mean, we kicked their butts.</i>

158
00:10:05,768 --> 00:10:08,771
The only thing better than beating
Princeton, beating Harvard.

159
00:10:08,897 --> 00:10:11,733
<i>You beat both of them when you won
the championship.</i>

160
00:10:11,768 --> 00:10:13,568
Went to the first
College World Series.

161
00:10:13,818 --> 00:10:16,321
<i>The first two college national
championships.</i>

162
00:10:16,404 --> 00:10:19,407
<i>Forty-seven and '48.
Right after you were born.</i>

163
00:10:19,449 --> 00:10:20,992
There are still photos of you...

164
00:10:21,201 --> 00:10:23,912
<i>...and that team up on the walls
of Delta Kappa.</i>

165
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:28,416
Tell you, things in this life
you wish you could go back, do over.

166
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,085
I could field, but I couldn't hit.

167
00:10:31,211 --> 00:10:33,296
Went 0 for 3 against Cal in the finals.

168
00:10:33,713 --> 00:10:35,089
<i>How history goes.</i>

169
00:10:35,173 --> 00:10:38,176
Still, you were on the greatest
Yale baseball team of all time.

170
00:10:39,552 --> 00:10:41,846
My father
would've kicked the crap out of me...

171
00:10:41,971 --> 00:10:45,099
<i>...if I ended up
where you are now, Junior.</i>

172
00:10:45,183 --> 00:10:46,643
They're gonna let me go, Poppy.

173
00:10:46,768 --> 00:10:49,771
I have to get out of New Jersey
and promise never to come back.

174
00:10:49,854 --> 00:10:52,065
Which is okey-dokey with me.

175
00:10:53,441 --> 00:10:55,818
<i>Don't work that way, Junior.</i>

176
00:10:55,944 --> 00:10:59,572
<i>Not to me, not to this family.</i>

177
00:10:59,697 --> 00:11:04,911
Now, I'm getting you out of this,
this time.

178
00:11:05,203 --> 00:11:08,206
I don't wanna get
any more phone calls like this again.

179
00:11:08,623 --> 00:11:10,124
<i>Ever.</i>

180
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:13,127
<i>- You hear me?
- Yes, sir.</i>

181
00:11:23,221 --> 00:11:26,140
- Where is your grease gun?
- It's up there.

182
00:11:26,266 --> 00:11:27,850
Quit messing with me.

183
00:11:40,238 --> 00:11:43,074
- Manuel.
- Get your butt back in here.

184
00:11:43,157 --> 00:11:46,160
I thought you just wanted me
to go up there just now.

185
00:11:47,745 --> 00:11:49,747
Shit.

186
00:11:56,713 --> 00:11:59,340
- What happened?
- I think the bearing stopped.

187
00:12:01,175 --> 00:12:04,095
- Hey, watch this for me, will you?
- Okay.

188
00:12:04,137 --> 00:12:06,305
- Watch it.
- Okay.

189
00:12:06,514 --> 00:12:08,099
Hey, Miguel.

190
00:12:16,024 --> 00:12:18,401
- Is that too hot?
- Yeah.

191
00:12:24,532 --> 00:12:26,117
Damn.

192
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:38,296
I need some help out here.

193
00:12:39,046 --> 00:12:42,884
Bush, what you doing off the floor?
Shift's not over till 1800.

194
00:12:43,217 --> 00:12:44,260
I'm having a drink, sir.

195
00:12:45,511 --> 00:12:47,472
Get back there.
The motor's overheating.

196
00:12:47,722 --> 00:12:49,140
I need every swinging dick I got.

197
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:52,185
Yeah, I know that.
But, sir, you see, I'm about parched.

198
00:12:52,602 --> 00:12:55,188
You know, I just need
a couple of minutes here.

199
00:12:55,229 --> 00:12:59,150
You already had your break. This ain't
some fancy-ass Ivy League school.

200
00:12:59,275 --> 00:13:01,903
Now, haul that butt of yours
back out to your motor...

201
00:13:01,986 --> 00:13:03,988
...before something else happens.

202
00:13:04,071 --> 00:13:06,157
All right. You know, sir...

203
00:13:07,325 --> 00:13:11,496
- ... I think this butt of mine just quit.
- That the way you want it?

204
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:15,249
That's fine with me.
Get your ass off my rig.

205
00:13:16,167 --> 00:13:17,835
I'll just get the next coach out.

206
00:13:19,003 --> 00:13:20,546
Thank you.

207
00:13:33,476 --> 00:13:36,917
Look, how many times
do I gotta tell you? You are my gal.

208
00:13:36,952 --> 00:13:40,358
I mean, I'm as happy as a rabbit
in a carrot patch with you.

209
00:13:40,441 --> 00:13:42,360
But you never say the words.

210
00:13:42,443 --> 00:13:43,611
What words?

211
00:13:43,778 --> 00:13:45,279
The L word.

212
00:13:45,363 --> 00:13:49,617
The L word? What, lesbian?
You're no lesbian.

213
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:52,537
What future are we gonna have
if you're always joking?

214
00:13:52,662 --> 00:13:54,539
Come on, Fran, I'm crazy about you.

215
00:13:54,747 --> 00:13:56,832
Okay?
We're gonna go back to Houston.

216
00:13:56,958 --> 00:14:00,586
We're gonna have a big church
wedding. All the trimmings. All of it.

217
00:14:00,711 --> 00:14:02,380
What kind of church?

218
00:14:02,463 --> 00:14:05,716
I grew up Episcopalian.
I grew up Presbyterian...

219
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,094
...and then
I turned into Episcopalian.

220
00:14:08,511 --> 00:14:09,762
Well, I'm a Baptist.

221
00:14:10,888 --> 00:14:13,356
Episcopalian, Baptist,
what the hell does it matter?

222
00:14:13,391 --> 00:14:16,560
You're gonna be one of us, a Bush.
How does that sound, sweetheart?

223
00:14:16,644 --> 00:14:19,063
You mean it? You swear it?

224
00:14:19,146 --> 00:14:22,275
Look, then we're gonna move
to New York. You ever been there?

225
00:14:22,483 --> 00:14:25,069
Bright lights, big city.
It's even bigger than Dallas.

226
00:14:25,194 --> 00:14:28,406
I'm gonna work on Wall Street.
I got an uncle who's gonna set me up.

227
00:14:28,447 --> 00:14:31,450
Told me, "Just say the word. "

228
00:14:31,575 --> 00:14:33,327
You gotta picture
a boatload of money.

229
00:14:33,411 --> 00:14:36,664
We're gonna be on a big boat
with lots of money.

230
00:14:37,498 --> 00:14:39,250
- New York?
- Yup.

231
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:41,585
I never dreamt of that.

232
00:14:42,169 --> 00:14:43,754
Start dreaming now.

233
00:14:48,134 --> 00:14:50,094
- George.
- Yeah?

234
00:14:50,219 --> 00:14:52,930
Are you proposing to me?

235
00:14:57,435 --> 00:15:01,272
If I had a rock big enough,
I'd give it to you right now.

236
00:15:08,029 --> 00:15:11,365
Freddie Mac, here we go,
two more shots.

237
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:13,367
Oh, I love this song. Come on, honey.

238
00:15:13,451 --> 00:15:17,121
- Come on. Get on up here, girl.
- What are you doing? You're crazy.

239
00:15:17,163 --> 00:15:18,789
Come on, baby.

240
00:15:27,882 --> 00:15:29,425
Yeah.

241
00:15:30,259 --> 00:15:31,635
Come on, my boy.

242
00:15:31,802 --> 00:15:34,138
Damn right, brother.

243
00:15:50,905 --> 00:15:53,199
- See you later, George. Tell Barbara hi.
- Junior.

244
00:15:54,575 --> 00:15:55,576
- Thanks for coming.
- W.

245
00:15:55,826 --> 00:15:56,744
Hey, guys.

246
00:15:56,827 --> 00:16:00,498
Tell him... Tell him that I won't be able
to do that till 3.

247
00:16:00,915 --> 00:16:03,417
No, that's the soonest I can do it.

248
00:16:04,251 --> 00:16:06,337
And hold my phone calls.

249
00:16:08,756 --> 00:16:11,133
Let's see now. Sit down.

250
00:16:13,427 --> 00:16:17,264
If I remember correctly, you didn't like
the sporting-goods job...

251
00:16:17,389 --> 00:16:19,892
...or the oil-rig job.

252
00:16:20,434 --> 00:16:24,355
Working in the investment firm
wasn't for you either.

253
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,942
That ranch-hand thing, Arizona.
That sure didn't last long.

254
00:16:27,977 --> 00:16:29,610
Didn't exactly finish up...

255
00:16:29,777 --> 00:16:32,821
...with flying colors
in the Air National Guard, Junior.

256
00:16:32,863 --> 00:16:34,782
We're still not out of that one.

257
00:16:34,907 --> 00:16:40,037
Now this gal, Suzie. Shooting off
her mouth about you knocking her up.

258
00:16:40,072 --> 00:16:43,249
- Wait. How did you know about that?
- Word gets around, boy.

259
00:16:43,457 --> 00:16:45,626
That's a danged lie, Poppy.

260
00:16:45,751 --> 00:16:48,671
I used a condom. I'm not dumb.

261
00:16:49,505 --> 00:16:50,965
What are you cut out for?

262
00:16:51,048 --> 00:16:54,802
Partying, chasing tail, driving drunk?

263
00:16:55,135 --> 00:16:58,055
What do you think you are?
A Kennedy?

264
00:16:58,138 --> 00:17:01,183
You're a Bush. Act like one.

265
00:17:01,308 --> 00:17:03,269
You can't even hold a job.

266
00:17:03,394 --> 00:17:05,229
We always worked for our living.

267
00:17:05,354 --> 00:17:07,231
It's time you joined the rest of us...

268
00:17:07,314 --> 00:17:10,067
...and decided what it is
you're gonna do with your life.

269
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:11,819
I know, Poppy.

270
00:17:11,902 --> 00:17:15,072
I'm just having a devil of a time
trying to figure it out.

271
00:17:15,155 --> 00:17:18,701
Well, then figure it out soon, Junior.

272
00:17:18,826 --> 00:17:21,328
Your brother Jeb
graduates Phi Beta Kappa.

273
00:17:21,912 --> 00:17:24,123
What did you get? Cs?

274
00:17:24,248 --> 00:17:26,333
You only get one bite at the apple.

275
00:17:26,417 --> 00:17:30,254
Well, Jeb's not me
and I don't wanna be Jeb, Poppy.

276
00:17:32,756 --> 00:17:34,425
Look, what I'd really love...

277
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:38,929
I mean, what I'd really love to do
is to find something in baseball.

278
00:17:38,971 --> 00:17:41,015
What? You can't play.

279
00:17:42,766 --> 00:17:46,437
Coach? You're fishing
for the moon in the water.

280
00:17:46,478 --> 00:17:47,771
Something real.

281
00:17:48,022 --> 00:17:50,524
I started out in the oil fields.
I was hoping that...

282
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,736
No, I'll try harder, Poppy, I promise.

283
00:17:53,861 --> 00:17:55,612
No, I can do it.

284
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:59,033
Can you? Can you really?

285
00:17:59,158 --> 00:18:01,243
You agreed to work
for a period of time...

286
00:18:01,368 --> 00:18:05,539
...and you haven't
kept your word once. Not once.

287
00:18:05,622 --> 00:18:08,334
In our family, the Bush family...

288
00:18:08,459 --> 00:18:10,961
...we honor our commitments.

289
00:18:15,632 --> 00:18:17,926
I'll take care of this...

290
00:18:18,427 --> 00:18:19,595
...young woman.

291
00:18:28,353 --> 00:18:30,731
You disappoint me, Junior.

292
00:18:31,148 --> 00:18:33,567
Deeply disappoint me.

293
00:18:35,444 --> 00:18:36,987
Is that it?

294
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:40,866
Yeah.

295
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:55,464
Almost three minutes behind, Rafael.
Pick up the pace.

296
00:18:56,173 --> 00:18:59,510
My running times are better than ever
since the Afghan invasion.

297
00:18:59,551 --> 00:19:02,679
I'm back down from 7-minute miles
to the 6:45s.

298
00:19:02,763 --> 00:19:06,308
I mean, honestly, I'm probably
the fastest president in history.

299
00:19:06,517 --> 00:19:09,144
I heard your father
was a pretty good runner too.

300
00:19:09,228 --> 00:19:11,021
Yeah, second fastest, maybe.

301
00:19:11,104 --> 00:19:13,190
He had endurance,
but not my kind of speed.

302
00:19:13,398 --> 00:19:14,650
What about Clinton?

303
00:19:14,733 --> 00:19:17,152
My mother waddles faster
than that lardass.

304
00:19:17,277 --> 00:19:20,489
<i>And my pulse is only 35/40.
You need to get in shape, Vice.</i>

305
00:19:20,614 --> 00:19:24,243
We need you around.
Three heart attacks is three too many.

306
00:19:25,077 --> 00:19:26,453
Thank you.

307
00:19:26,537 --> 00:19:28,288
Mr. President...

308
00:19:28,705 --> 00:19:33,377
...if there was an E. coli breakout
in a produce farm in Maryland...

309
00:19:33,418 --> 00:19:38,006
...would you take the chance of eating
the lettuce in that sandwich?

310
00:19:38,048 --> 00:19:39,466
Why are you bringing this up?

311
00:19:39,675 --> 00:19:41,969
I mean, you know I got tasters
in the kitchen.

312
00:19:42,052 --> 00:19:44,888
If there was a 1 percent chance
of you dying, sir...

313
00:19:44,972 --> 00:19:47,474
...would you eat the lettuce
in that sandwich?

314
00:19:48,851 --> 00:19:50,644
One percent?

315
00:19:51,478 --> 00:19:52,729
No. Probably not.

316
00:19:52,813 --> 00:19:54,565
Most people wouldn't, sir.

317
00:19:54,815 --> 00:19:56,650
And that's the dark side.

318
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:01,488
The 1 percent chance of a nuclear
attack, or an anthrax epidemic...

319
00:20:01,523 --> 00:20:04,408
...or God help us,
a smallpox outbreak.

320
00:20:04,491 --> 00:20:09,997
We'd have 200 million Americans
dead on our hands.

321
00:20:10,539 --> 00:20:12,332
Why are you
bringing this up at lunch?

322
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:15,127
Vice, I mean, you know
I agree with you on this.

323
00:20:16,086 --> 00:20:19,715
<i>Because I'm more worried now
than I was on 9/11.</i>

324
00:20:19,756 --> 00:20:23,051
And you know
how disorganized we were.

325
00:20:23,176 --> 00:20:26,096
I just wanna know
where you're going with this.

326
00:20:27,222 --> 00:20:29,182
Mr. President...

327
00:20:29,933 --> 00:20:34,855
...this is a fulcrum point in history.
Your presidency.

328
00:20:34,938 --> 00:20:38,692
<i>The Middle East, 9/11,
homeland security.</i>

329
00:20:38,817 --> 00:20:41,820
Everything is coming together
like a perfect storm.

330
00:20:41,862 --> 00:20:44,031
Now, with all due respect, sir...

331
00:20:44,114 --> 00:20:47,367
...I don't think this executive branch
is ready for that.

332
00:20:48,285 --> 00:20:52,956
- Didn't we get the Patriot Act through?
- Doesn't go far enough, sir.

333
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:56,918
All right, Vice, so, what do you want
me to do that I haven't already done?

334
00:20:57,127 --> 00:21:00,797
I mean, look, we're on top of the
banks, the telecoms, the databases...

335
00:21:00,881 --> 00:21:02,883
...these Internet carriers.

336
00:21:02,966 --> 00:21:05,719
We're tracking, what,
a billion phone calls a day?

337
00:21:05,802 --> 00:21:08,263
- We got this Guantanemera open.
- Guantanamo.

338
00:21:08,305 --> 00:21:11,224
Nobody's gonna be hearing
from those people for a long time.

339
00:21:11,308 --> 00:21:14,061
Sir, I served your father.

340
00:21:14,144 --> 00:21:16,438
And he was an able
and honorable man.

341
00:21:16,563 --> 00:21:20,067
And he won the Iraq war.

342
00:21:20,192 --> 00:21:25,489
But he, myself and Powell...

343
00:21:25,614 --> 00:21:28,200
...we let that momentum slip away.

344
00:21:28,325 --> 00:21:29,368
And if we hadn't...

345
00:21:29,576 --> 00:21:32,496
<i>...we wouldn't be looking down
the barrel of another 9/11.</i>

346
00:21:32,579 --> 00:21:34,581
I told my father the same thing
back then:

347
00:21:34,664 --> 00:21:36,541
"Take the sucker out. "

348
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:40,921
So, what do you think the odds are
that Saddam's got nukes?

349
00:21:40,962 --> 00:21:45,383
Well, according to our sources,
90 percent.

350
00:21:45,425 --> 00:21:48,678
- But even if it was 1 percent...
- You don't have to sell me.

351
00:21:48,762 --> 00:21:50,847
We gotta sell the American people...

352
00:21:50,931 --> 00:21:52,307
...okay, and Colin.

353
00:21:53,141 --> 00:21:55,769
The Commander in Chief
doesn't have to sell anything.

354
00:21:55,852 --> 00:21:59,815
He has constitutionally
unlimited power in wartime.

355
00:21:59,856 --> 00:22:03,777
And you have the capacity
to do anything you see fit.

356
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:06,071
Okay.

357
00:22:06,905 --> 00:22:09,199
What's that thing you got there?

358
00:22:09,282 --> 00:22:11,076
This is a sign-off.

359
00:22:11,368 --> 00:22:13,703
It authorizes us...

360
00:22:13,787 --> 00:22:16,706
...to use "interrogation techniques...

361
00:22:16,748 --> 00:22:19,626
...against unlawful
enemy combatants...

362
00:22:19,709 --> 00:22:22,129
...with maximal
effective persuasion. "

363
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,383
Like pulling out their toenails?

364
00:22:26,508 --> 00:22:29,636
No sir.
Enhanced interrogation techniques...

365
00:22:29,719 --> 00:22:32,138
...means utilizing fear scenarios...

366
00:22:32,222 --> 00:22:36,476
...like dogs or isolation...

367
00:22:36,518 --> 00:22:40,272
...or simulated drowning
or sleep deprivation...

368
00:22:40,397 --> 00:22:43,733
...or enforced stress positions,
but nothing fatal.

369
00:22:45,485 --> 00:22:48,196
Kind of reminds me
of my fraternity days.

370
00:22:49,739 --> 00:22:52,075
Remember,
we don't use torture in this country.

371
00:22:52,158 --> 00:22:53,493
No torture.

372
00:22:53,618 --> 00:22:56,121
But it includes our citizens too.

373
00:22:56,246 --> 00:23:00,709
If they are aiding and abetting
terrorist organizations.

374
00:23:01,334 --> 00:23:02,377
Makes sense.

375
00:23:02,586 --> 00:23:06,006
Still, I can see all these
latte-sipping lefties going nuts again.

376
00:23:06,047 --> 00:23:07,799
The Kyoto bullshit was bad enough.

377
00:23:07,924 --> 00:23:12,262
Now it'll be all the sobbing
over the Geneva Convention.

378
00:23:12,387 --> 00:23:14,556
Let me take a look at it.

379
00:23:17,684 --> 00:23:19,060
Only three pages? Good.

380
00:23:19,894 --> 00:23:22,272
The Office of Legal Counsel
is with us on this one.

381
00:23:22,397 --> 00:23:25,191
- I got it, Vice, I'll look at it.
- If we sign this week...

382
00:23:25,233 --> 00:23:28,028
...with Congress in recess,
we're gonna have less nonsense.

383
00:23:28,111 --> 00:23:30,530
- I said, I'll look at it.
- Okay.

384
00:23:31,573 --> 00:23:33,867
I'll let you finish your lunch.

385
00:23:37,954 --> 00:23:39,706
Oh, Vice...

386
00:23:41,041 --> 00:23:43,043
...when we're in meetings
with others...

387
00:23:43,126 --> 00:23:45,128
...I just want you to keep a lid on it.

388
00:23:45,962 --> 00:23:47,213
I thought I was, sir.

389
00:23:47,297 --> 00:23:50,050
No, you heard me.
Just keep your ego in check.

390
00:23:50,216 --> 00:23:52,552
You know, because, remember,
I'm the president.

391
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:55,347
I'm the decider.

392
00:24:00,477 --> 00:24:02,854
- I totally agree, sir.
- Okay.

393
00:24:39,015 --> 00:24:44,020
Ninety, 45, 90 is the plan, sir.
Two hundred and twenty-five days.

394
00:24:44,062 --> 00:24:45,271
Ninety for prep.

395
00:24:45,397 --> 00:24:47,482
Moving 150,000 troops into Kuwait...

396
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:50,276
...building the airfields,
moving equipment.

397
00:24:50,318 --> 00:24:52,695
Then air strikes for 45 days.

398
00:24:52,779 --> 00:24:56,032
- Then 90 days of ground combat.
- A hundred and fifty thousand men?

399
00:24:56,116 --> 00:24:59,035
I mean, I'm not looking
to play small ball here, Tommy.

400
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:02,205
We put 500,000 pairs of boots
on the ground, Desert Storm.

401
00:25:02,288 --> 00:25:03,957
We planned for any possibility.

402
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:07,210
I think the Pentagon can wrestle
this thing down to 100,000.

403
00:25:07,293 --> 00:25:08,878
Go light. Like Afghanistan.

404
00:25:08,962 --> 00:25:11,548
Blitz the bejesus out of them
from the air.

405
00:25:11,673 --> 00:25:13,633
Total shock and awe, Mr. President.

406
00:25:13,758 --> 00:25:15,635
Shock and awe. I like it. I like that.

407
00:25:15,718 --> 00:25:17,095
So when can we go?

408
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,597
Well, January,
February, March is best.

409
00:25:19,722 --> 00:25:21,057
What about April, May, June?

410
00:25:21,266 --> 00:25:23,560
No, you can't start a war
in Iraq after March.

411
00:25:23,643 --> 00:25:26,479
They got scorchers out there,
burn the hide off a scorpion.

412
00:25:26,563 --> 00:25:28,773
All right.
I can run in that kind of heat.

413
00:25:28,898 --> 00:25:31,985
Not with
a biohazard suit on, you can't, sir.

414
00:25:32,026 --> 00:25:34,070
I like the cut of your jib, Tommy.

415
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,906
I don't mean to rain
on Tommy's parade here, sir.

416
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:39,742
If you go through with this,
you're gonna be the owner...

417
00:25:39,826 --> 00:25:42,745
...of 26 million Iraqi people
standing around looking at us.

418
00:25:42,829 --> 00:25:46,082
You break it, you own it.
And I can tell you something.

419
00:25:46,166 --> 00:25:47,250
You need to understand.

420
00:25:47,333 --> 00:25:50,253
It's gonna suck the oxygen
right out of everything you do.

421
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:51,921
It will become your first term.

422
00:25:52,005 --> 00:25:55,258
Your father weighed this when we
weighed the merits of the Gulf War.

423
00:25:55,341 --> 00:25:58,803
Well, that may be so, Colin, but
my dad's fishing at Kennebunkport...

424
00:25:58,845 --> 00:26:00,680
...and Saddam's still
dicking us around.

425
00:26:00,889 --> 00:26:02,432
I didn't say we're going yet.

426
00:26:02,557 --> 00:26:05,268
I still think we can use
that 52nd card, you know...

427
00:26:05,351 --> 00:26:07,270
...proof that he's got the WMDs.

428
00:26:07,353 --> 00:26:09,355
You mean the 53rd card,
sir, the joker?

429
00:26:09,439 --> 00:26:11,733
No, that would be you,
Brother George.

430
00:26:11,858 --> 00:26:13,943
Hey, whoa, fellas.

431
00:26:15,486 --> 00:26:17,697
I think we missed the side road.

432
00:26:24,871 --> 00:26:27,582
Sir, I presume we'll win this war.

433
00:26:28,291 --> 00:26:29,792
Then what?

434
00:26:30,209 --> 00:26:31,878
What is our exit strategy?

435
00:26:31,961 --> 00:26:35,924
Well, the DOD has already drawn up
initial plans for a post-Hussein era...

436
00:26:35,965 --> 00:26:39,886
...which would include the exercise of
democracy and a free-market economy.

437
00:26:39,969 --> 00:26:42,388
Well, I'm glad State's
been consulted.

438
00:26:42,472 --> 00:26:45,391
What type of government is DOD
talking about putting in Iraq?

439
00:26:45,433 --> 00:26:47,894
Come on, Spotty.
Make me proud, girl.

440
00:26:48,019 --> 00:26:51,147
Look, fellas,
in the end it's about freedom.

441
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:53,316
A free country is a peaceful country.

442
00:26:53,441 --> 00:26:56,653
My dream is to see peace break out
all over the Middle East.

443
00:26:56,778 --> 00:27:00,239
So any kind of government will do.
As long as it's a democracy.

444
00:27:00,274 --> 00:27:01,658
Indeed.

445
00:27:01,908 --> 00:27:03,743
Yeah, the cars are this way.

446
00:27:03,868 --> 00:27:06,579
Half a mile maybe. Follow me.

447
00:27:18,466 --> 00:27:20,343
<i>Boy, we're not seeing
that guy today.</i>

448
00:27:20,426 --> 00:27:23,680
<i>Well, this is a guy
who got hurt in practice...</i>

449
00:27:23,763 --> 00:27:25,848
<i>So just a lot of development there.</i>

450
00:27:25,973 --> 00:27:28,768
<i>He wasn't the starter for the first half
of the season...</i>

451
00:27:28,893 --> 00:27:32,105
<i>...so he's continuing to evolve.</i>

452
00:27:33,689 --> 00:27:36,109
<i>They're at 11,
they need to get to the 25.</i>

453
00:27:36,192 --> 00:27:38,611
<i>Randall under pressure,
the ball is loose...</i>

454
00:27:38,694 --> 00:27:39,946
<i>...and Texas has it.</i>

455
00:27:40,029 --> 00:27:42,532
<i>- Yes!
- Will go all the way, touchdown...</i>

456
00:27:42,657 --> 00:27:44,117
<i>- Yes!
- ... Longhorns.</i>

457
00:27:46,202 --> 00:27:48,204
<i>Redding knocked it loose...</i>

458
00:27:48,371 --> 00:27:50,373
<i>...and Jackson cashes in.</i>

459
00:28:20,194 --> 00:28:22,822
Hey, give me that, little brother.

460
00:28:22,905 --> 00:28:24,657
That's enough.

461
00:28:24,907 --> 00:28:26,450
That's enough.

462
00:28:31,998 --> 00:28:33,249
Poppy.

463
00:28:33,332 --> 00:28:34,917
We're here.

464
00:28:35,835 --> 00:28:38,546
We made it. Yeah.

465
00:28:42,008 --> 00:28:43,426
Come on.

466
00:28:47,013 --> 00:28:48,973
Marvin, go to your room.

467
00:28:49,098 --> 00:28:51,058
- Do what your dad says.
- What the hell...

468
00:28:51,184 --> 00:28:52,935
- ... do you think you're doing?
- What?

469
00:28:53,561 --> 00:28:55,354
He's only 15.

470
00:28:55,438 --> 00:28:57,523
I've had just about enough
of your crap.

471
00:28:58,858 --> 00:29:00,651
You had enough of me?

472
00:29:01,194 --> 00:29:03,446
I'm mighty glad to hear that.

473
00:29:03,571 --> 00:29:05,239
Because I've had enough of you...

474
00:29:05,364 --> 00:29:07,200
...for a lifetime...

475
00:29:07,325 --> 00:29:09,410
- ... and then some.
- My advice to you, Junior:

476
00:29:09,535 --> 00:29:12,330
Get yourself
to an AA meeting. Get help.

477
00:29:12,455 --> 00:29:17,043
Thank you, Mr., what, Perfect,
Mr. War Hero, Mr. God Almighty.

478
00:29:17,078 --> 00:29:19,128
Don't you talk
to your father that way.

479
00:29:19,211 --> 00:29:20,880
I'll talk to him however I want to.

480
00:29:21,088 --> 00:29:24,300
When in tarnation is this boy
gonna get out of his own way?

481
00:29:24,342 --> 00:29:26,302
How many chances
do you expect us to give?

482
00:29:26,385 --> 00:29:28,179
Can't you talk to me?

483
00:29:28,387 --> 00:29:31,724
Well, why do you tell her?
That's it. Let's go.

484
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:33,726
Mano a mano.

485
00:29:33,809 --> 00:29:36,228
You and me. Right here. Right now.

486
00:29:36,312 --> 00:29:37,897
- You want an ass-whipping?
- Yeah.

487
00:29:38,064 --> 00:29:40,691
- I'll give it to you.
- Jeb, do something.

488
00:29:40,733 --> 00:29:41,943
Both of you, just stop it.

489
00:29:42,151 --> 00:29:44,236
- Have you lost your minds?
- Try it, old man.

490
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:48,324
- Go ahead. Take a swing.
- Hey, calm down.

491
00:29:49,325 --> 00:29:51,744
Don't you realize
he was out celebrating?

492
00:29:51,827 --> 00:29:55,289
- He just got into Harvard Business.
- What?

493
00:29:55,414 --> 00:29:57,583
George, why didn't you tell us?

494
00:29:57,667 --> 00:29:58,918
Because I ain't going.

495
00:29:59,043 --> 00:30:02,922
Okay? I just wanted to show you all
that I could do it. Get in.

496
00:30:02,957 --> 00:30:05,091
- Love me now?
- Calm down. He'll...

497
00:30:05,174 --> 00:30:06,425
He'll change his mind.

498
00:30:06,676 --> 00:30:09,470
I wouldn't count on it,
Jebbie, old boy.

499
00:30:09,595 --> 00:30:13,182
- George.
- You scared me half to death.

500
00:30:13,224 --> 00:30:17,269
All right, now, he got into Harvard.
Will you give him a little credit?

501
00:30:17,311 --> 00:30:20,606
Of course he got in.
Who do you think pulled the strings?

502
00:30:21,774 --> 00:30:23,359
You did.

503
00:30:31,701 --> 00:30:34,704
That's 20. Stay in.

504
00:30:38,666 --> 00:30:40,459
How about that?

505
00:30:41,043 --> 00:30:42,294
Excuse me. Excuse me.

506
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:44,213
All right. Here we go.

507
00:30:44,296 --> 00:30:46,173
Oh, come on.

508
00:30:46,382 --> 00:30:49,093
My income for the week.

509
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:51,720
Bush, you're just fleecing us tonight.

510
00:30:51,804 --> 00:30:53,889
You're better at poker
than finding oil.

511
00:30:53,973 --> 00:30:57,560
Is it my fault the good Lord
didn't put oil where I been digging?

512
00:30:57,643 --> 00:31:00,062
Don't ask us to invest any more
in your dry well.

513
00:31:00,146 --> 00:31:01,897
Hey, Corn Dog. You remember this.

514
00:31:02,022 --> 00:31:05,234
You invest in me, you'll get
your money back and plenty more.

515
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:08,404
Better start shaking
that money tree somehow.

516
00:31:08,487 --> 00:31:11,824
Well, the great peanut farmer
and rabbit hunter, Jimmy Carter...

517
00:31:11,866 --> 00:31:15,161
...sure ain't helping. Solar panels
on the roof of the White House?

518
00:31:15,244 --> 00:31:17,329
Big government taxes
are back, boys.

519
00:31:17,455 --> 00:31:18,497
Amen to that.

520
00:31:18,581 --> 00:31:21,834
Hope and pray your daddy
can take him out in 1980.

521
00:31:21,917 --> 00:31:23,586
He's gotta get past Reagan first.

522
00:31:23,711 --> 00:31:25,171
Your dad's a true statesman.

523
00:31:25,379 --> 00:31:27,756
He can take out
that Hollywood actor, right, W?

524
00:31:27,882 --> 00:31:30,259
Hey, Jimmy, what if I tell you...

525
00:31:30,384 --> 00:31:33,512
...that I'm ready to get
in the family business myself.

526
00:31:34,013 --> 00:31:35,806
You're not talking about oil now?

527
00:31:35,931 --> 00:31:38,100
No, I ain't.
No, I'm ready to take a shot.

528
00:31:38,309 --> 00:31:40,686
Because a sign has come unto me.

529
00:31:40,811 --> 00:31:41,854
What has come unto you?

530
00:31:42,062 --> 00:31:46,233
This July 6th, what notable event
happened right here in West Texas?

531
00:31:46,358 --> 00:31:47,693
You're birthday, wasn't it?

532
00:31:47,776 --> 00:31:48,944
We already celebrated.

533
00:31:49,153 --> 00:31:51,447
Yes, and George Mahon
announced...

534
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:54,366
...his retirement from Congress
after 44 years.

535
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:56,368
- That's right.
- What a coincidence.

536
00:31:56,452 --> 00:31:58,537
This, and right on my birthday.

537
00:31:58,621 --> 00:32:01,540
And now that he's gone, boys,
the 19th District...

538
00:32:01,957 --> 00:32:04,793
...is in play for a Republican.

539
00:32:05,544 --> 00:32:08,130
And that Republican
is going to be...?

540
00:32:08,214 --> 00:32:10,549
Yours truly, Skeeter.

541
00:32:11,884 --> 00:32:15,262
Hope you don't forget us little people
when you're in the Capital.

542
00:32:15,304 --> 00:32:18,641
Well, saddle up our horses, boys,
and send George W. to Washington.

543
00:32:18,766 --> 00:32:20,142
- Hey.
- What I like to hear.

544
00:32:20,851 --> 00:32:22,811
Both of them?
That would be Bush City.

545
00:32:22,937 --> 00:32:24,188
Bush City.

546
00:32:25,147 --> 00:32:26,899
Bushington.

547
00:32:45,167 --> 00:32:47,336
- Thank you.
- All right, you all gotta meet...

548
00:32:47,544 --> 00:32:49,213
...my husband.
This is Don. Don Evans.

549
00:32:49,421 --> 00:32:51,173
How do you do? I'm Don Evans.

550
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:57,429
Oh, George!

551
00:32:59,765 --> 00:33:01,433
Hey, Suzie, how are you?

552
00:33:01,517 --> 00:33:02,851
Good to see you. Skeeter.

553
00:33:03,102 --> 00:33:04,645
What's up, Bush? How you doing?

554
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:07,147
Can I get that beer, Jan?
Thank you, honey.

555
00:33:07,272 --> 00:33:10,609
You give me that laundry right here.

556
00:33:12,277 --> 00:33:14,446
I have to borrow him for one...

557
00:33:15,364 --> 00:33:17,866
- Laura.
- Yo, give me a burger, will you?

558
00:33:17,908 --> 00:33:19,368
- You got it.
- Yeah? All right.

559
00:33:19,952 --> 00:33:22,705
Laura, come here.

560
00:33:22,871 --> 00:33:26,125
I'd like for you to meet
George Bush Jr.

561
00:33:26,458 --> 00:33:30,212
- Laura Welch.
- You can call me anything but Junior.

562
00:33:31,755 --> 00:33:33,966
You know, I remember seeing you
in school.

563
00:33:34,883 --> 00:33:38,971
We were in the 7th grade together
at San Jacinto Junior High.

564
00:33:39,006 --> 00:33:40,806
San Jacinto, yeah.

565
00:33:40,931 --> 00:33:43,016
Year after I moved to Houston.

566
00:33:43,142 --> 00:33:46,562
I don't know how I could have missed
seeing someone as pretty as you are.

567
00:33:46,645 --> 00:33:49,273
- Because I wasn't a cheerleader.
- That could be it.

568
00:33:49,398 --> 00:33:52,067
I've only been trying to get you two
to meet for years.

569
00:33:52,109 --> 00:33:54,820
Joe, can you put some more burgers
on the barbecue?

570
00:33:54,903 --> 00:33:57,072
- Dang.
- Two with cheese. I'll get the drinks.

571
00:33:57,197 --> 00:33:58,741
I gotta go give him a hand.

572
00:33:58,991 --> 00:34:01,785
George, got your clean laundry
ready for you on the way out.

573
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:05,330
Thanks, hon.
And thanks for saying it out loud.

574
00:34:08,751 --> 00:34:10,335
So, what do you do, Laura?

575
00:34:12,212 --> 00:34:16,175
I read, I smoke, I admire.

576
00:34:17,092 --> 00:34:19,928
When you do admire,
you admire what?

577
00:34:20,012 --> 00:34:22,514
People who write, who read.
I'm a librarian.

578
00:34:26,602 --> 00:34:28,687
Actually, I'm reading something
right now.

579
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:30,439
Yeah, a very engaging book.

580
00:34:30,772 --> 00:34:31,815
Oh, what is it?

581
00:34:32,232 --> 00:34:34,735
<i>Barry Goldwater's
Conscience of a Conservative.</i>

582
00:34:36,403 --> 00:34:37,946
- Jan.
- Don't tell me.

583
00:34:38,197 --> 00:34:41,617
I worked on Gene McCarthy's
campaign. And voted for LBJ.

584
00:34:41,658 --> 00:34:43,494
Oh, no. No.

585
00:34:43,619 --> 00:34:46,955
Well, looks like we're hitting it off
like grease hits the skillet.

586
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:49,750
Well, I don't think politics
should define a human being.

587
00:34:49,875 --> 00:34:52,377
There's more to people
than just how they vote.

588
00:34:52,461 --> 00:34:54,546
I like that. I like that.
You're open-minded.

589
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:57,257
Yeah, much more so than me,
I have to say.

590
00:34:57,799 --> 00:35:02,262
Well, I just think it's important to see
all sides of a situation.

591
00:35:05,307 --> 00:35:07,809
I read in the paper
that you're running for Congress.

592
00:35:07,893 --> 00:35:08,810
Yes, ma'am, I am.

593
00:35:09,353 --> 00:35:11,438
I don't believe in forcing myself
on people.

594
00:35:11,563 --> 00:35:15,067
So that's why I'm just gonna ask
for your phone number, not your vote.

595
00:35:15,317 --> 00:35:17,986
Oh, well,
I couldn't vote for you, anyway.

596
00:35:18,111 --> 00:35:20,072
I live in Austin.

597
00:35:22,074 --> 00:35:24,076
Not that I wouldn't consider it.

598
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:26,161
Well, thank you for that.

599
00:35:26,245 --> 00:35:28,747
- But if you win...
- Yeah?

600
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:31,583
...please do something for education.

601
00:35:32,084 --> 00:35:34,169
I was a teacher.
I believe that's the thing...

602
00:35:34,253 --> 00:35:36,588
...that can make a difference
in people's lives.

603
00:35:36,672 --> 00:35:40,926
Well, I'll tell you what. If I win,
you can be my education advisor.

604
00:35:41,176 --> 00:35:43,262
- Yeah, right.
- No, no, no. I'm serious.

605
00:35:43,345 --> 00:35:46,056
I like the way you think, you know?

606
00:35:46,765 --> 00:35:48,433
And look.

607
00:35:50,852 --> 00:35:51,895
You're a devil.

608
00:35:55,524 --> 00:35:57,442
Devil in a white hat.

609
00:36:02,197 --> 00:36:03,991
My daddy and granddaddy
were farmers.

610
00:36:04,116 --> 00:36:06,702
They didn't have anything to do
with this mess we're in.

611
00:36:06,785 --> 00:36:10,247
Bush's daddy and granddaddy have
been in politics his whole life.

612
00:36:10,372 --> 00:36:12,624
They don't know what
people's suffering is about.

613
00:36:12,749 --> 00:36:15,669
George Bush here
hasn't earned the living he enjoys.

614
00:36:15,752 --> 00:36:18,171
I stand on my own two feet,
make my own living.

615
00:36:18,296 --> 00:36:20,465
When it comes to the integrity
of my father...

616
00:36:20,549 --> 00:36:22,259
...what mess are you talking about?

617
00:36:22,342 --> 00:36:23,802
Washington is the way it is...

618
00:36:23,885 --> 00:36:26,722
...because of the Yale and Harvard
fellas running the place.

619
00:36:28,056 --> 00:36:30,475
I went to Texas Tech,
you went to Yale.

620
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,978
I went to UT Law,
you went to Harvard.

621
00:36:33,061 --> 00:36:36,606
I've spent half my life in Midland.
I know the problems of the people here.

622
00:36:36,648 --> 00:36:38,400
Yeah, maybe at the country club.

623
00:36:38,483 --> 00:36:40,902
You're still an outsider
as far as we're concerned.

624
00:36:41,028 --> 00:36:42,362
Mr. Hance will be nothing...

625
00:36:42,571 --> 00:36:45,073
...but a tax-and-spend errand boy
for the Democrats...

626
00:36:45,198 --> 00:36:47,492
And he's really a carpetbagger
from Connecticut.

627
00:36:47,576 --> 00:36:50,162
- That's below the belt, even for you.
- It's God's truth.

628
00:36:50,287 --> 00:36:53,999
Carpetbagger? This is my home. I've
been here in Midland since I was 2.

629
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:58,420
You're still an Easterner as far as we're
concerned. East don't mix with Texas.

630
00:36:58,462 --> 00:36:59,546
My fellow Christians...

631
00:36:59,796 --> 00:37:02,466
My fellow Christians
everywhere from Odessa to Lubbock...

632
00:37:02,507 --> 00:37:05,719
...last week, Mr. Bush here used
some of his vast sums of money...

633
00:37:05,802 --> 00:37:09,264
...to throw a beer bash
for underage students at Texas Tech.

634
00:37:09,347 --> 00:37:10,432
A Bush Bash.

635
00:37:10,599 --> 00:37:12,934
He's trying to get students
to vote for him...

636
00:37:13,101 --> 00:37:16,354
...by offering free alcohol to them.
Bribing them with booze.

637
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,774
Well, you've had a beer or two
in your lifetime.

638
00:37:18,857 --> 00:37:20,942
Hell, yeah, but I'm not drinking
with kids.

639
00:37:21,026 --> 00:37:23,111
That may be the cool thing
to do at Yale...

640
00:37:23,236 --> 00:37:25,614
...but not here in good
Christian country.

641
00:37:25,739 --> 00:37:28,033
<i>He just kept hammering away at me,
you know?</i>

642
00:37:28,116 --> 00:37:31,870
The same lame stuff, tarring and
feathering me about my father.

643
00:37:31,912 --> 00:37:34,498
My father. What am I supposed to do?
Run as Sam Smith?

644
00:37:34,623 --> 00:37:39,419
Your family name has its advantages
and its disadvantages, W.

645
00:37:39,454 --> 00:37:41,796
Now, I'd still be with you
if you were Sam Smith.

646
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,716
There's gotta be intelligent people
that can see through him.

647
00:37:44,925 --> 00:37:47,761
They should,
but he was so busy attacking you.

648
00:37:47,844 --> 00:37:52,724
I got in some licks before he threw
the dirty tricks there at the end. Right?

649
00:37:53,058 --> 00:37:56,478
- Well...
- What, you don't agree?

650
00:37:58,563 --> 00:38:01,816
Your mother told me never to criticize
a politician's speech.

651
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,985
Honey, look, I got a thick hide.

652
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:06,821
You can tell me the truth.

653
00:38:06,905 --> 00:38:08,615
Come on.

654
00:38:10,367 --> 00:38:12,786
What, it was all bad?

655
00:38:13,828 --> 00:38:15,914
It wasn't good.

656
00:38:25,382 --> 00:38:27,884
Why did you do that?

657
00:38:30,512 --> 00:38:31,930
That was crazy.

658
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:33,932
I told you I can take criticism.

659
00:38:34,015 --> 00:38:36,935
- You see, I'm already over it.
- The car isn't.

660
00:38:37,686 --> 00:38:40,939
Do not ask me for my opinion
on your speeches again.

661
00:38:41,022 --> 00:38:45,402
Honey, look, I'm gonna be asking you
for a long, long time.

662
00:38:45,443 --> 00:38:47,362
Not while we're driving then, please.

663
00:38:47,487 --> 00:38:50,198
I never dated a woman quite like you,
you know that?

664
00:38:50,323 --> 00:38:51,950
Hey, I think...

665
00:38:52,158 --> 00:38:53,952
I think you are the gal for me.

666
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,788
Look, you're one of
the greatest listeners I've ever met.

667
00:38:56,955 --> 00:39:00,292
And since I'm one of the biggest
talkers, it seems like a genuine fit.

668
00:39:00,333 --> 00:39:01,876
What do you think, huh?

669
00:39:03,336 --> 00:39:06,381
- It kind of does.
- Only kind of?

670
00:39:12,512 --> 00:39:15,223
- More than kind of.
- Yeah.

671
00:39:18,351 --> 00:39:22,647
<i>The polls have now closed and
it looks like Democrat Kent Hance...</i>

672
00:39:22,682 --> 00:39:25,775
<i>...has defeated Republican candidate
George W. Bush...</i>

673
00:39:25,984 --> 00:39:28,945
<i>...in the race for
the 19th Congressional District.</i>

674
00:39:28,987 --> 00:39:34,117
<i>And while Bush garnered
a respectable 47,497 votes...</i>

675
00:39:34,152 --> 00:39:38,580
<i>...Hance swept into the lead
with 53,97...</i>

676
00:39:42,751 --> 00:39:44,627
Well, look at it this way.

677
00:39:44,753 --> 00:39:48,381
You came closer than any Republican
ever has in this district.

678
00:39:48,423 --> 00:39:50,675
First is first and second is nothing.

679
00:39:50,884 --> 00:39:52,886
At least we won here in Midland.

680
00:39:52,969 --> 00:39:54,971
The people who know you best
voted for you.

681
00:39:55,055 --> 00:39:59,225
I should've stuck it right back up
his butt. That's what I should've done.

682
00:39:59,642 --> 00:40:01,728
Geo, you wanted to play fair.

683
00:40:01,853 --> 00:40:04,355
You didn't wanna get in the gutter.
Even though you lost...

684
00:40:04,522 --> 00:40:09,778
- ... you can hold your head up.
- Laura, politics is not a library.

685
00:40:09,813 --> 00:40:12,363
It's a kick-ass, skull-crushing war,
and I lost.

686
00:40:12,447 --> 00:40:14,949
- You'll get him next time.
- If there is a next time.

687
00:40:15,074 --> 00:40:16,951
- George.
- Look, I'll tell you one thing.

688
00:40:17,035 --> 00:40:20,914
There's no way I will ever be
out-Texaned or out-Christianed again.

689
00:41:03,039 --> 00:41:05,750
How's it going, word guys?
You gotta get cracking...

690
00:41:05,959 --> 00:41:09,295
...on my foreign-policy speech
tomorrow. I need the draft by tonight.

691
00:41:09,337 --> 00:41:12,632
You'll get it. We just have to get
our guy at the NSC to sign off on it.

692
00:41:12,757 --> 00:41:16,469
All right. You get your guys,
you get Tenet, then I decide.

693
00:41:16,511 --> 00:41:20,682
I'm going to bed after Sports Cap, so
I want it in my room by 8 p. m., latest.

694
00:41:20,765 --> 00:41:22,850
- No excuses now.
- Yes, Mr. President.

695
00:41:22,934 --> 00:41:24,644
Come on, sit down, get writing.

696
00:41:26,479 --> 00:41:28,189
You think we can get this stuff in?

697
00:41:28,356 --> 00:41:30,775
<i>If we can't,
we can always leak it to the Times.</i>

698
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:32,860
All right. Let me get our guy
on the horn.

699
00:41:34,028 --> 00:41:38,616
Just to be safe, I wouldn't say 500,
I would say up to 500 metric tons.

700
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:40,368
<i>- Continue.
- "Some ask why Iraq...</i>

701
00:41:40,577 --> 00:41:43,621
...is different from countries
that also have terrible weapons.

702
00:41:43,656 --> 00:41:45,707
While there are many dangers
in this world...

703
00:41:45,790 --> 00:41:47,667
...the threat from Iraq stands alone. "

704
00:41:47,875 --> 00:41:51,296
I'll have to have this approved by
the agency. Let me fax it to Langley.

705
00:41:51,337 --> 00:41:52,880
I'll get in touch with Tenet.

706
00:41:52,964 --> 00:41:54,340
<i>Okay.</i>

707
00:41:54,966 --> 00:41:58,261
George, it only takes
about 10 tons of yellow cake...

708
00:41:58,303 --> 00:42:01,139
<i>...to produce enough uranium
for a single nuclear weapon.</i>

709
00:42:01,222 --> 00:42:02,974
Hank, I have already
gone over this...

710
00:42:03,099 --> 00:42:05,476
...with the vice president's office
and DOD.

711
00:42:05,601 --> 00:42:09,147
This information comes from a single
foreign source.

712
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:11,149
It has not been confirmed.

713
00:42:11,232 --> 00:42:12,900
Besides, Hank...

714
00:42:12,984 --> 00:42:16,029
...it's not solid enough
to be out front with. Take it out.

715
00:42:16,529 --> 00:42:17,697
You're sure?

716
00:42:17,905 --> 00:42:19,574
I just can't go with it.

717
00:42:24,495 --> 00:42:25,913
Get me Mike again.

718
00:42:26,956 --> 00:42:29,500
- Yeah?
- You have to take out the red meat...

719
00:42:29,667 --> 00:42:31,878
<i>...but leave all the spice you can.</i>

720
00:42:32,003 --> 00:42:33,671
Okay, thanks.

721
00:42:33,838 --> 00:42:36,966
Slight change of plans. It's out.

722
00:42:37,008 --> 00:42:40,011
We got a lot of work to do
before Sports Cap.

723
00:42:43,014 --> 00:42:46,350
So, Karl, how long is this
History Channel thing gonna take?

724
00:42:46,476 --> 00:42:50,021
- Card scheduled it for 45 minutes.
- Come on, Spotty, this one's for you.

725
00:42:53,274 --> 00:42:55,234
God. Spotty's getting old.

726
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:57,195
She needs a seeing-eye dog
for herself.

727
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:59,530
You know,
once she was a great athlete.

728
00:42:59,614 --> 00:43:02,408
You should have seen her.
She was like the DiMaggio of dogs.

729
00:43:02,533 --> 00:43:04,410
- So you remember your lead?
- Yup.

730
00:43:04,494 --> 00:43:07,747
Ronald Reagan believed that
everything happened for a reason...

731
00:43:07,872 --> 00:43:10,750
...and that we should strive to know
and do the will of God.

732
00:43:13,169 --> 00:43:16,631
Looks like your balls have been put
through the wringer, Ari. What's up?

733
00:43:16,666 --> 00:43:17,757
- Helen Thomas.
- Barney...

734
00:43:17,965 --> 00:43:20,551
...how many times do I gotta tell you?
Stay back.

735
00:43:20,885 --> 00:43:22,970
- And what else did I write down?
- Berlin Wall.

736
00:43:23,179 --> 00:43:24,222
Right. Cold War.

737
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:26,390
Reagan didn't say,
"Mr. Gorbachev...

738
00:43:26,516 --> 00:43:29,519
...will you take down the top
three bricks off the Berlin Wall?"

739
00:43:29,644 --> 00:43:32,647
He said, "Tear it down. Tear it
all down. " And so they did.

740
00:43:32,772 --> 00:43:35,900
- Good boy, Barney.
- Memory's still the greatest, sir.

741
00:43:36,651 --> 00:43:39,153
You know, I'm a lot more like him
than my father.

742
00:43:39,237 --> 00:43:42,573
And the world has to know clearly
where America stands.

743
00:43:42,657 --> 00:43:44,116
Yeah.

744
00:43:44,242 --> 00:43:47,245
What's that old battle-ax,
Helen Thomas, ragging on about now?

745
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:50,623
Did she say anything about,
you know, Iraq?

746
00:43:52,917 --> 00:43:55,086
She was talking about
secret plans...

747
00:43:55,169 --> 00:43:58,089
...for regime change there.
You know the rap:

748
00:43:58,214 --> 00:44:00,800
"What makes Saddam
different from any other dictator?

749
00:44:00,925 --> 00:44:03,135
What right do we have
to go to war with Iraq?"

750
00:44:03,219 --> 00:44:06,973
Did you tell her I don't like mudsuckers
who gas their own people?

751
00:44:07,598 --> 00:44:10,852
Did you tell her I don't like assholes
that try to kill my father?

752
00:44:10,935 --> 00:44:15,314
Did you tell her that I'm gonna kick
his sorry ass all over the Mideast?

753
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:18,943
Well, I told her about half of that.

754
00:44:21,153 --> 00:44:22,947
Only half?

755
00:44:32,081 --> 00:44:35,126
Here's to turning 40
and looking 30.

756
00:44:35,209 --> 00:44:38,045
Nothing old about you
except a few of your jokes.

757
00:44:38,671 --> 00:44:40,756
I think my jokes are funny.

758
00:44:40,881 --> 00:44:46,804
To the best thing that ever came out
of a Texas backyard barbecue.

759
00:44:46,846 --> 00:44:49,307
May all yours and Laura's dreams
come true.

760
00:44:49,390 --> 00:44:52,560
- Each and every one of them.
- It's baseball, you know.

761
00:44:52,643 --> 00:44:55,021
I think Bushie wants to be
baseball commissioner.

762
00:44:55,146 --> 00:44:58,149
- Why not? I love baseball.
- After all the times I've gone...

763
00:44:58,274 --> 00:44:59,942
...I just never could get into it!

764
00:45:00,067 --> 00:45:02,236
You know who I grew up dreaming
to be, Spider?

765
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:04,405
- Who?
- Willie "The Say Hey Kid" Mays.

766
00:45:04,530 --> 00:45:05,906
He was the greatest ever.

767
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:09,535
The problem is you couldn't hit
the curve ball, and you're white.

768
00:45:09,619 --> 00:45:12,163
That's right, I am white. I'm white.

769
00:45:12,246 --> 00:45:15,374
- Phone call for you, Mr. Bush.
- Whoa, Buddy Holly.

770
00:45:16,834 --> 00:45:19,837
- Who is it?
- The vice president, sir.

771
00:45:21,339 --> 00:45:25,009
All right. All right, I'll get that
and it's time to get serious.

772
00:45:25,051 --> 00:45:28,721
I'll see you in a while.
All right, I'll tell him you said hello.

773
00:45:28,846 --> 00:45:31,223
You guys, I'll be right back.

774
00:45:35,102 --> 00:45:36,228
Poppy.

775
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:39,065
<i>I just wanted to wish you
a happy birthday, son.</i>

776
00:45:39,148 --> 00:45:41,525
<i>- Oh, thank you.
- Hope you're enjoying yourself.</i>

777
00:45:41,650 --> 00:45:43,861
Oh, I am, very much so.
Thank you, sir.

778
00:45:43,944 --> 00:45:45,946
<i>How's Laura?</i>

779
00:45:46,781 --> 00:45:47,698
Sweet as ever.

780
00:45:47,782 --> 00:45:50,284
<i>- And the girls?
- They're back home in Midland.</i>

781
00:45:50,409 --> 00:45:52,787
We were just hoping
to get some alone time.

782
00:45:52,912 --> 00:45:53,954
<i>A good thing.</i>

783
00:45:54,163 --> 00:45:56,374
<i>Your mother and I, we rarely get that.</i>

784
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:00,294
You know, I'm gearing up to run in '88.

785
00:46:00,419 --> 00:46:02,713
Yes, sir.
I think that's great.

786
00:46:02,797 --> 00:46:05,007
<i>Your brother Jeb can't get away
from Florida.</i>

787
00:46:06,801 --> 00:46:08,135
How'd you like to lend a hand?

788
00:46:10,429 --> 00:46:11,472
In what way?

789
00:46:12,515 --> 00:46:15,309
Would you be willing
to come to Washington?

790
00:46:15,434 --> 00:46:16,685
Help me run my campaign?

791
00:46:26,153 --> 00:46:27,947
Yes or no?

792
00:46:29,198 --> 00:46:31,408
We'll do the... We'll do the river.

793
00:46:31,492 --> 00:46:32,827
So, what did he have to say?

794
00:46:33,244 --> 00:46:34,620
Well...

795
00:46:34,829 --> 00:46:36,497
...looks like we're moving to D.C.

796
00:46:38,499 --> 00:46:39,750
All right.

797
00:46:39,917 --> 00:46:42,253
- Hey, all right.
- Yeah.

798
00:46:46,841 --> 00:46:48,592
All right.

799
00:47:01,313 --> 00:47:03,274
Come on now.

800
00:47:21,041 --> 00:47:22,042
Good morning.

801
00:47:24,253 --> 00:47:27,715
Well, Jan beat me 6 to 1. I'm never
gonna be any good at that game.

802
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:31,760
I think it's because I drank
almost as much as you last night.

803
00:47:32,052 --> 00:47:33,304
You all right there?

804
00:47:33,429 --> 00:47:36,140
Oh, I can't go on like this.

805
00:47:36,348 --> 00:47:38,434
- I'm through.
- Through what?

806
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:39,560
Drinking.

807
00:47:39,685 --> 00:47:42,730
Well, everyone knows you're trying.

808
00:47:42,813 --> 00:47:44,481
Why don't you take today off?

809
00:47:44,565 --> 00:47:45,816
Stay in bed.

810
00:47:46,066 --> 00:47:48,652
No. I gotta do my miles.

811
00:47:48,861 --> 00:47:50,946
My three miles.

812
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:54,575
I'll suck it up.

813
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:59,413
You know, George, Washington
is gonna be a big change for us.

814
00:47:59,448 --> 00:48:01,248
For the girls.

815
00:48:02,916 --> 00:48:05,836
Your father is running for president.

816
00:48:06,253 --> 00:48:09,882
I think it's so nice of him
to show such confidence in you.

817
00:48:09,923 --> 00:48:13,469
You could not have asked for
a better birthday present.

818
00:48:13,594 --> 00:48:16,263
Confidence? He only called me
because Jeb wasn't available.

819
00:48:16,305 --> 00:48:17,931
The point is, he asked you.

820
00:48:18,474 --> 00:48:23,187
He wants you. Bushie, why do you
do this to yourself? Why?

821
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:28,192
You gonna throw up?

822
00:48:30,277 --> 00:48:31,945
Three miles.

823
00:49:52,526 --> 00:49:55,112
<i>You are my God and savior.</i>

824
00:49:55,362 --> 00:49:57,948
<i>I always trust thee.</i>

825
00:49:58,157 --> 00:50:01,368
- In Jesus' name, Amen.
- Amen.

826
00:50:01,410 --> 00:50:03,579
Amen.

827
00:50:03,704 --> 00:50:06,081
We'll see you all next week.

828
00:50:06,498 --> 00:50:08,792
- God bless you.
- Thank you.

829
00:50:15,048 --> 00:50:16,925
You hit a dry well,
you keep on drilling.

830
00:50:17,050 --> 00:50:18,594
Oh, yeah. Thank you.

831
00:50:18,719 --> 00:50:21,722
- Thank you very much, sir.
- Bye-bye.

832
00:50:30,397 --> 00:50:31,940
Earle.

833
00:50:32,566 --> 00:50:35,068
There's always this weight on me.

834
00:50:35,152 --> 00:50:36,820
This heaviness.

835
00:50:37,487 --> 00:50:40,574
And no matter how many times
I come here or go to church...

836
00:50:40,616 --> 00:50:43,076
...that weight just won't lift.

837
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:48,624
W...

838
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:53,503
...the Christian life
is not a constant high.

839
00:50:54,254 --> 00:50:57,132
I got my moments
of deep discontentment.

840
00:50:57,174 --> 00:51:00,928
And I got to go to God, just like you,
and say, "God, please help me. "

841
00:51:01,428 --> 00:51:03,430
But all I am is name.

842
00:51:03,513 --> 00:51:06,016
People say that
I was born with a silver spoon...

843
00:51:06,266 --> 00:51:08,518
...but they don't know
the burden it carries.

844
00:51:08,644 --> 00:51:10,312
I believe you, W.

845
00:51:10,437 --> 00:51:13,231
And that's all right.
You know, that's okay.

846
00:51:13,774 --> 00:51:15,192
Now, look.

847
00:51:17,527 --> 00:51:20,197
Look what you have achieved.

848
00:51:20,322 --> 00:51:23,533
It's been, what, almost six months
that you haven't touched a drink.

849
00:51:23,659 --> 00:51:24,701
Yes, sir.

850
00:51:24,785 --> 00:51:27,621
Well, the good Lord sees that,
and he's proud of you.

851
00:51:27,704 --> 00:51:29,706
We're all proud of you.

852
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:34,294
The worst thing you could
ever say in your life are the words:

853
00:51:34,336 --> 00:51:39,091
"If only I could live it over again. " No.

854
00:51:39,383 --> 00:51:42,427
Born again, W, that's what you are.

855
00:51:42,552 --> 00:51:47,224
God has spoken to you.
We've all sinned, Lord knows.

856
00:51:47,849 --> 00:51:50,560
But it's what you
have learned that matters.

857
00:51:50,644 --> 00:51:52,437
- You hear me, George?
- Yes, sir.

858
00:51:52,562 --> 00:51:55,232
I do. I hear you, Reverend,
I really do.

859
00:51:55,357 --> 00:51:57,317
For God so loved the world...

860
00:51:57,442 --> 00:51:59,736
...that he gave his only begotten son...

861
00:52:00,570 --> 00:52:02,322
...that whosoever believeth in him...

862
00:52:02,447 --> 00:52:06,618
...shall not perish
but shall have everlasting life.

863
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:08,912
John 3:16.

864
00:52:09,413 --> 00:52:13,291
Now take the baton. Reach out.

865
00:52:13,333 --> 00:52:14,668
And beginning today...

866
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:17,045
...I want you to treat
everybody you meet...

867
00:52:17,254 --> 00:52:19,840
...your friends, your enemies,
everybody...

868
00:52:19,881 --> 00:52:22,467
...like they were gonna
be dead at midnight.

869
00:52:23,009 --> 00:52:24,010
Yes, sir.

870
00:52:24,261 --> 00:52:28,515
You give that person
all the love that's in you, son...

871
00:52:28,557 --> 00:52:30,684
...and do it without
any thought of reward...

872
00:52:30,809 --> 00:52:32,477
...and your life, I promise you...

873
00:52:32,602 --> 00:52:34,563
...will never be the same again.

874
00:52:40,193 --> 00:52:42,904
You stay with it, W,
because I can tell you...

875
00:52:43,029 --> 00:52:47,617
...straight as A meets up and
mates with B, you are one of us now.

876
00:52:48,201 --> 00:52:52,622
And you will never be alone now
that you're one of us, okay? Yeah?

877
00:52:52,657 --> 00:52:58,461
From all walks of life,
we are a country of wounded sinners.

878
00:52:58,545 --> 00:53:00,714
A nation, a Christian nation.

879
00:53:00,839 --> 00:53:04,593
There are millions of us born again.

880
00:53:08,889 --> 00:53:10,849
Can I ask you, Earle, to pray with me?

881
00:53:11,057 --> 00:53:13,643
It would be my pride and joy
to pray with you, son.

882
00:53:13,768 --> 00:53:15,312
Thank you, sir.

883
00:53:21,818 --> 00:53:22,944
Heavenly Father...

884
00:53:24,070 --> 00:53:28,074
...we humbly thank you
for giving our servant, George...

885
00:53:28,158 --> 00:53:30,869
...the wisdom, the strength
and the understanding...

886
00:53:30,911 --> 00:53:33,246
...to know the power of your ways.

887
00:53:33,371 --> 00:53:37,250
And may he always see the light
even in his darkest days.

888
00:53:37,334 --> 00:53:41,004
In Jesus' holy name, Amen.

889
00:53:41,039 --> 00:53:42,672
Amen.

890
00:53:44,633 --> 00:53:46,092
A set-up job.

891
00:53:46,176 --> 00:53:51,014
Look, I'm a devout Christian.
Been one all my life.

892
00:53:51,514 --> 00:53:53,683
No need for me to say
I've been reborn.

893
00:53:53,808 --> 00:53:57,145
No, we're not looking to put words
in your mouth, sir, far from it.

894
00:53:57,270 --> 00:53:59,856
Only to help you
be understood by our community...

895
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:02,359
...who do not understand you at all.

896
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,778
If you say no it's gonna cost you votes.

897
00:54:04,945 --> 00:54:07,781
And Karl knows his stuff,
and these men want you to win.

898
00:54:07,822 --> 00:54:12,577
It's just a matter of coding, Poppy.
I mean...

899
00:54:12,869 --> 00:54:15,497
It's all right, Genius Boy.
Sometimes he thinks he's me.

900
00:54:15,622 --> 00:54:16,957
Go on, Karl.

901
00:54:17,165 --> 00:54:22,462
Well, it's rephrasing things
so that you connect to the base.

902
00:54:22,504 --> 00:54:24,547
I can show you this metric data,
if you like.

903
00:54:24,673 --> 00:54:27,384
Fellas, I appreciate your support.

904
00:54:27,467 --> 00:54:29,052
Obviously need it.

905
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:31,888
Trying to learn the lingo, but...

906
00:54:31,971 --> 00:54:35,308
Still an old-school Episcopalian
you're looking at.

907
00:54:35,392 --> 00:54:39,979
Junior here, I mean W,
is the real born again.

908
00:54:41,231 --> 00:54:44,532
All right, gentlemen.
Thank you. Thanks a bunch.

909
00:54:44,567 --> 00:54:47,487
- Thank you, Mr. Vice President.
- Thank you very much, sir.

910
00:54:47,612 --> 00:54:49,572
- Thank you.
- Thank you, John.

911
00:54:58,331 --> 00:55:01,668
They all act like businessmen. They're
screamers and temple burners.

912
00:55:01,710 --> 00:55:05,839
Come on. They're all protgs
of Billy Graham, and from Texas.

913
00:55:05,964 --> 00:55:08,591
Look, this is a bigtime change
going on out there.

914
00:55:08,626 --> 00:55:10,260
People are hungering for faith.

915
00:55:10,427 --> 00:55:13,471
Your mother said you're really reborn.

916
00:55:13,888 --> 00:55:17,517
Well, as long as you stop drinking,
you can call it what you want.

917
00:55:17,642 --> 00:55:19,728
I'm not comfortable with this stuff.

918
00:55:20,270 --> 00:55:22,939
Inauthentic.
Nixon did stuff like that.

919
00:55:23,189 --> 00:55:25,692
I'm trusting you to vet everything.

920
00:55:25,775 --> 00:55:27,944
I'm just looking for every edge, Poppy.

921
00:55:28,069 --> 00:55:29,320
Check this spot out.

922
00:55:33,908 --> 00:55:35,994
<i>Bush and Dukakis on crime.</i>

923
00:55:36,202 --> 00:55:39,122
<i>Bush supports the death penalty
for first-degree murderers.</i>

924
00:55:39,205 --> 00:55:41,624
<i>Dukakis not only opposes
the death penalty...</i>

925
00:55:41,708 --> 00:55:45,587
<i>...he allowed first-degree murderers
to have weekend passes from prison.</i>

926
00:55:45,628 --> 00:55:48,298
<i>One was Willie Horton,
who murdered a boy in a robbery...</i>

927
00:55:48,381 --> 00:55:49,966
<i>...stabbing him 19 times.</i>

928
00:55:50,383 --> 00:55:51,843
<i>Despite a life sentence...</i>

929
00:55:52,051 --> 00:55:54,888
<i>...Horton received
10 weekend passes from prison.</i>

930
00:55:54,923 --> 00:55:57,140
<i>Horton fled,
kidnapped a young couple...</i>

931
00:55:57,265 --> 00:55:59,767
<i>...stabbing the man
and raping his girlfriend.</i>

932
00:55:59,893 --> 00:56:03,521
<i>Weekend prison passes,
Dukakis on crime...</i>

933
00:56:03,646 --> 00:56:06,316
This guy Willie Horton
is gonna be a household name.

934
00:56:06,441 --> 00:56:08,401
This and Dukakis
in that silly helmet...

935
00:56:08,526 --> 00:56:11,571
...sitting in the tank are gonna
put you over this time, Poppy.

936
00:56:11,988 --> 00:56:15,408
Strong stuff. Naughty.

937
00:56:15,617 --> 00:56:17,911
But you can't run
this through the campaign.

938
00:56:17,994 --> 00:56:20,413
You've got to use another pipeline.

939
00:56:20,496 --> 00:56:22,498
I'm ahead of you, Poppy,
don't you worry.

940
00:56:22,582 --> 00:56:24,918
We outsourced it to
the National Security PAC.

941
00:56:25,001 --> 00:56:27,170
Roger Ailes and his group,
they funded it.

942
00:56:28,421 --> 00:56:31,466
Well, that's good work, son.
Really good.

943
00:56:32,926 --> 00:56:34,802
Earning your spurs now.

944
00:56:34,928 --> 00:56:36,054
Thank you, sir.

945
00:56:42,310 --> 00:56:45,104
<i>Here is Tom Brokaw, NBC News.</i>

946
00:56:45,230 --> 00:56:47,440
<i>Good evening,
and Vice President George Bush...</i>

947
00:56:47,523 --> 00:56:49,943
<i>...who's been in government housing
for 8 years...</i>

948
00:56:50,026 --> 00:56:52,028
<i>...will continue
to live in government...</i>

949
00:56:57,116 --> 00:57:01,371
<i>George Bush is
president-elect of the United States.</i>

950
00:57:07,543 --> 00:57:09,629
We should send
Willie Horton a fruit basket.

951
00:57:09,712 --> 00:57:11,631
That's a good idea.

952
00:57:13,716 --> 00:57:16,094
You look down. What is it?

953
00:57:16,219 --> 00:57:19,722
- Congratulations.
- Well, I'm just tired.

954
00:57:23,059 --> 00:57:25,395
Just wondering what's
gonna happen now, Karl.

955
00:57:25,478 --> 00:57:27,355
What do you mean?

956
00:57:30,066 --> 00:57:33,361
My father's not gonna give me
a position, because he can't.

957
00:57:33,403 --> 00:57:37,991
And I'm not gonna sit around,
become a lobbyist. That's for sure.

958
00:57:38,324 --> 00:57:40,284
George...

959
00:57:42,996 --> 00:57:48,466
I've been a lifelong student
of political horseflesh.

960
00:57:48,501 --> 00:57:55,007
From what I see, you've got
a natural talent. Got the people touch.

961
00:57:55,042 --> 00:57:59,178
But you need to go
out in the world, do something.

962
00:57:59,262 --> 00:58:04,767
I don't know how else to say it,
but you haven't done jack shit yet.

963
00:58:08,646 --> 00:58:10,189
<i>George.</i>

964
00:58:11,441 --> 00:58:13,526
George, come on to bed.

965
00:58:14,068 --> 00:58:17,405
Rove hit me
with a 2-by-4 of truth tonight.

966
00:58:17,530 --> 00:58:19,198
Yeah, what was that?

967
00:58:19,282 --> 00:58:21,868
That I'll never get out
of Poppy's shadow.

968
00:58:22,118 --> 00:58:25,037
They'll all keep saying,
"What's the boy ever done?"

969
00:58:25,121 --> 00:58:27,707
I mean, who ever remembers
the son of a president?

970
00:58:29,208 --> 00:58:31,711
John Quincy Adams.

971
00:58:32,962 --> 00:58:35,965
Yeah, but that was like
300 years ago, wasn't it?

972
00:58:36,883 --> 00:58:38,676
You know what? I wish he'd lost.

973
00:58:38,801 --> 00:58:40,762
What?

974
00:58:41,471 --> 00:58:43,681
- How can you say that?
- I don't know.

975
00:58:43,806 --> 00:58:47,226
- I got crazy, mixed feelings about it.
- What are you talking about?

976
00:58:47,310 --> 00:58:50,980
You helped him win the presidency.
You gained his respect.

977
00:58:51,022 --> 00:58:53,816
No matter what I do,
it's just never gonna be enough.

978
00:58:53,983 --> 00:58:55,776
Okay? Never.

979
00:58:58,905 --> 00:59:00,907
What's the bottom line, George?

980
00:59:01,073 --> 00:59:02,325
That Baghdad has...

981
00:59:02,575 --> 00:59:05,661
...chemical and biological weapons
currently active, no question.

982
00:59:05,703 --> 00:59:07,663
Nukes? In some stage or other?

983
00:59:07,747 --> 00:59:10,249
That's still problematic, sir.
We say not yet...

984
00:59:10,374 --> 00:59:15,254
...but with moderate confidence we can
say they will have them by 2007, 2009.

985
00:59:15,296 --> 00:59:18,299
But definitely this guy
has got anthrax, mustard gas...

986
00:59:18,424 --> 00:59:21,928
...sarin, VX,
as much as 500 tons of CBW.

987
00:59:22,053 --> 00:59:25,681
Given the dual-use provisions of the
U.N. sanctions, we can't prove intent.

988
00:59:25,723 --> 00:59:26,766
Until he launches.

989
00:59:26,933 --> 00:59:30,353
Their military is deteriorated,
infrastructure is shattered...

990
00:59:30,394 --> 00:59:33,731
Why is British Intelligence
telling us now that this guy...

991
00:59:33,856 --> 00:59:38,027
...is trying to buy up a few hundred
tons of yellow cake from Niger?

992
00:59:38,062 --> 00:59:40,112
- We still have no backup on that.
- We don't.

993
00:59:40,196 --> 00:59:43,950
Well, we know this:

994
00:59:44,283 --> 00:59:48,454
That Saddam is talking to Zarqawi,
who is talking to al Qaeda...

995
00:59:48,489 --> 00:59:51,958
...and Atta met Saddam's
intel chief in Czechoslovakia.

996
00:59:51,999 --> 00:59:54,377
There is no doubt that they're linked.

997
00:59:55,127 --> 00:59:56,545
No doubt, Dick?

998
00:59:56,671 --> 00:59:58,547
No doubt at all?

999
01:00:00,216 --> 01:00:02,635
No doubt, Colin.

1000
01:00:06,681 --> 01:00:08,140
What do you say, Rummy?

1001
01:00:08,349 --> 01:00:11,435
Sir, the absence of evidence
is not the evidence of absence.

1002
01:00:11,477 --> 01:00:15,648
Just because you do not have
evidence that something does exist...

1003
01:00:15,731 --> 01:00:16,983
...does not mean you have...

1004
01:00:17,108 --> 01:00:19,485
Can your intel say
where these WMDs are?

1005
01:00:19,610 --> 01:00:25,324
Well, my people think they've found
something in the area around Tikrit.

1006
01:00:27,243 --> 01:00:29,745
But we also have leads
around Baghdad.

1007
01:00:29,829 --> 01:00:34,083
And to the areas east, west,
south, and north somewhat.

1008
01:00:34,208 --> 01:00:36,585
- Well, let's find them, Rummy.
- Indeed.

1009
01:00:36,711 --> 01:00:38,587
We know this guy Saddam's
hiding stuff.

1010
01:00:38,671 --> 01:00:41,590
We know the U.N.'s
one big international mosh pit.

1011
01:00:41,716 --> 01:00:44,427
We got a lot of maybes, probablys
and buts from George...

1012
01:00:44,510 --> 01:00:46,429
...which John Q. Public
ain't gonna buy.

1013
01:00:46,512 --> 01:00:49,849
We can present better,
but we don't have nukes.

1014
01:00:49,932 --> 01:00:52,268
What we have is a slam-dunk
on the others.

1015
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:53,394
Slam-dunk?

1016
01:00:53,519 --> 01:00:55,771
What have you been drinking,
Brother George?

1017
01:00:55,896 --> 01:00:57,982
What you need
is to bring in some lawyers...

1018
01:00:58,107 --> 01:01:00,192
...who can argue cases
with juries to help.

1019
01:01:00,276 --> 01:01:02,278
These snapshots
and Iraqi gobbledygook...

1020
01:01:02,361 --> 01:01:04,655
...on tape is just another
bunch of bullshit.

1021
01:01:04,864 --> 01:01:06,831
Sir, you know,
whatever we come up with...

1022
01:01:06,866 --> 01:01:11,120
...the United Nations is gonna want
more time and another resolution.

1023
01:01:11,155 --> 01:01:12,163
The old Europe.

1024
01:01:12,288 --> 01:01:14,457
Your father went to the U.N.,
Mr. President...

1025
01:01:14,540 --> 01:01:18,294
...and it took him six months, as I
remember, but he got his resolution.

1026
01:01:18,419 --> 01:01:19,670
And he got Congress too.

1027
01:01:19,795 --> 01:01:23,007
My gosh, Colin, you're the finest
military man in this room...

1028
01:01:23,132 --> 01:01:24,467
...we all know that.

1029
01:01:24,550 --> 01:01:27,720
But don't you think the Gulf War
days are long gone?

1030
01:01:28,137 --> 01:01:31,932
Do we really need six months
and half a million men...

1031
01:01:31,974 --> 01:01:35,728
...to knock off a tin-pot dictator
with a ragtag army?

1032
01:01:35,770 --> 01:01:37,605
You're right, Don,
I am a military man.

1033
01:01:37,813 --> 01:01:41,484
And you
more than anyone in this room...

1034
01:01:41,567 --> 01:01:44,570
...learned the lessons of Vietnam.

1035
01:01:46,363 --> 01:01:49,575
Now, I think we're all adults
in this room...

1036
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:54,997
<i>...and we recognize that 9/11,
no matter how horrific it was...</i>

1037
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:56,165
...and it was...

1038
01:01:56,248 --> 01:02:00,419
...was also an opportunity this time
for us to get it right.

1039
01:02:01,921 --> 01:02:04,006
Drain the swamp.

1040
01:02:04,089 --> 01:02:09,178
Sweep up all the bad guys
in one big move.

1041
01:02:09,220 --> 01:02:11,388
Things related and not.

1042
01:02:11,805 --> 01:02:14,808
Otherwise, sir, they will be back.

1043
01:02:14,850 --> 01:02:16,810
I thought we just did that
in Afghanistan.

1044
01:02:17,019 --> 01:02:19,021
We keep the focus
on sweeping up Bin Laden.

1045
01:02:19,104 --> 01:02:23,609
Goodness gracious, if you want
to call Afghanistan a war, Colin.

1046
01:02:23,644 --> 01:02:26,820
You know there were no real targets
to bomb there.

1047
01:02:26,862 --> 01:02:29,865
- It was an exercise.
- In any case...

1048
01:02:29,949 --> 01:02:33,619
...if we don't act,
all of us will be out of here in 2004.

1049
01:02:33,702 --> 01:02:35,371
And that's the bottom line.

1050
01:02:35,454 --> 01:02:37,373
So this is all about politics, Karl?

1051
01:02:37,456 --> 01:02:40,042
I'm confused
as to what you're doing in this room.

1052
01:02:40,167 --> 01:02:41,835
Okay, let's stay on message here.

1053
01:02:41,961 --> 01:02:44,964
Look, Genius Boy is just here
to listen, not talk.

1054
01:02:45,047 --> 01:02:46,840
You see, sir...

1055
01:02:47,675 --> 01:02:49,885
...what I'm pressing for here...

1056
01:02:49,969 --> 01:02:51,637
...is why?

1057
01:02:52,471 --> 01:02:54,557
Why are we doing this?

1058
01:02:55,182 --> 01:02:56,558
Why Iraq?

1059
01:02:56,642 --> 01:02:59,228
- Why now?
- We discussed that already, Colin.

1060
01:02:59,353 --> 01:03:03,315
We had America
protected September 11th.

1061
01:03:03,399 --> 01:03:06,318
That is, if people had been
doing their jobs right.

1062
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:08,112
But we blew it.

1063
01:03:08,404 --> 01:03:12,408
And now instead of taking down
these 10,000 al Qaeda lunatics...

1064
01:03:12,491 --> 01:03:14,910
...in the mountains
with special operations...

1065
01:03:14,994 --> 01:03:17,162
...we're way outside of the box
on this thing.

1066
01:03:17,288 --> 01:03:19,081
Why aren't we trusting the system?

1067
01:03:21,041 --> 01:03:22,918
Why have we veered off
to this place...

1068
01:03:23,002 --> 01:03:26,672
...where we accept without debate
that a preemptive strike on Iraq...

1069
01:03:26,755 --> 01:03:29,258
...can defeat terrorism
better than police action...

1070
01:03:29,383 --> 01:03:31,468
...or intel agencies
that share information?

1071
01:03:31,593 --> 01:03:35,222
I just don't get it, Mr. President,
I don't. Because I am a soldier.

1072
01:03:35,347 --> 01:03:39,935
And I'd be mighty sure before
I put young American lives at risk.

1073
01:03:40,019 --> 01:03:43,272
- Here we are...
- Okay, Secretary Powell, come on.

1074
01:03:43,307 --> 01:03:45,858
Let me finish.

1075
01:03:48,277 --> 01:03:50,029
Here we are...

1076
01:03:50,112 --> 01:03:53,449
...changing the whole way
we do business...

1077
01:03:53,866 --> 01:03:58,787
...in response to a small but dedicated
enemy hiding out in caves and jungles.

1078
01:03:58,829 --> 01:04:03,042
- Are we losing our perspective here?
- We changed our perspective.

1079
01:04:05,127 --> 01:04:07,546
The Trade Center was bombed in '93.

1080
01:04:07,629 --> 01:04:10,382
We had a huge attack
on Oklahoma in '95.

1081
01:04:10,466 --> 01:04:13,719
And those who did it
are in jail or dead.

1082
01:04:13,802 --> 01:04:15,387
Big difference.

1083
01:04:15,471 --> 01:04:21,101
Oklahoma terrorists
didn't have anthrax or nukes.

1084
01:04:21,643 --> 01:04:22,770
Colin...

1085
01:04:22,978 --> 01:04:26,106
...I swear, you're beginning
to sound like Neville Chamberlain.

1086
01:04:26,231 --> 01:04:28,317
Oh, don't patronize me,
Mr. Five Deferments.

1087
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:31,236
You save that for speeches
to veterans. Neville Chamberlain.

1088
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:32,905
You think, really...

1089
01:04:33,072 --> 01:04:36,617
You think,
with all your diplomatic bullshit...

1090
01:04:36,658 --> 01:04:41,747
...that you can appease Islamic
fascists, who are as nuts as Hitler.

1091
01:04:43,499 --> 01:04:46,251
You wanna know what I see,
Mr. President?

1092
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:49,463
I see a world
where in about 25 years...

1093
01:04:49,588 --> 01:04:52,090
...America's reserves are gone.

1094
01:04:53,217 --> 01:04:54,343
Done.

1095
01:04:54,468 --> 01:04:55,594
Demand is up...

1096
01:04:55,719 --> 01:04:57,179
...30, 40 percent.

1097
01:04:57,387 --> 01:05:03,101
And we have two oceans
blocking us from the world reserves.

1098
01:05:03,143 --> 01:05:06,021
You think we're gonna
have allies then?

1099
01:05:06,772 --> 01:05:09,608
We're at 5 percent
of the world's population.

1100
01:05:09,691 --> 01:05:13,195
We use 25 percent of its energy.

1101
01:05:13,237 --> 01:05:15,864
You think Russia and China
are gonna help us out...

1102
01:05:16,156 --> 01:05:18,367
...when they need
those resources themselves?

1103
01:05:19,368 --> 01:05:23,205
Eighty percent of the world's
future energy reserves...

1104
01:05:23,247 --> 01:05:28,126
...are right here in Eurasia,
where the prize ultimately lies.

1105
01:05:28,168 --> 01:05:31,296
Oil, gas, water.

1106
01:05:32,005 --> 01:05:35,634
Iraq alone,
10 percent of the world's reserves...

1107
01:05:35,759 --> 01:05:40,187
...60 of 80 oil fields
are still undeveloped.

1108
01:05:40,222 --> 01:05:43,392
And probably another 100 billion
gallons in their western desert.

1109
01:05:43,475 --> 01:05:45,978
- They are floating in a sea of oil.
- We have bases...

1110
01:05:46,061 --> 01:05:48,981
...in more than 120 countries
all over the world.

1111
01:05:49,106 --> 01:05:51,733
If we include Iraq,
look what happens.

1112
01:05:54,528 --> 01:05:58,907
We are at the fertile
choke point of civilization.

1113
01:05:58,991 --> 01:06:02,578
The Tigris-Euphrates,
the biblical cradle.

1114
01:06:02,613 --> 01:06:05,664
We drain this swamp, like Don says.

1115
01:06:05,789 --> 01:06:07,040
We rebuild it.

1116
01:06:07,457 --> 01:06:09,543
We develop its resources
to the maximum.

1117
01:06:09,668 --> 01:06:11,628
They own it, we run it.

1118
01:06:11,753 --> 01:06:15,382
Pipelines, sea lanes, their resources
finance the reconstruction.

1119
01:06:15,507 --> 01:06:19,011
A nexus of power that won't be broken
in our lifetime.

1120
01:06:19,261 --> 01:06:21,638
If we stick to the plan.

1121
01:06:22,180 --> 01:06:26,018
So, what is our real exit strategy
on Iraq, Dick?

1122
01:06:32,357 --> 01:06:34,026
There is no exit.

1123
01:06:37,279 --> 01:06:38,947
We stay.

1124
01:06:45,203 --> 01:06:46,955
Spoken like a true oilman.

1125
01:06:47,914 --> 01:06:50,584
You were part of the plan, Colin,
back in the '90s.

1126
01:06:50,625 --> 01:06:54,046
You backed our dominance in
weaponry, space, cyber, electronic.

1127
01:06:54,171 --> 01:06:56,048
You agreed
that we would never allow...

1128
01:06:56,131 --> 01:06:59,051
...another military-economic rival
to emerge against us again.

1129
01:06:59,176 --> 01:07:01,386
- I don't understand...
- Turning weapons loose...

1130
01:07:01,470 --> 01:07:04,723
...on terrorists is like trying to hit
an ant with an elephant gun.

1131
01:07:04,806 --> 01:07:07,642
We invoke preemption...
Preventive war, you call it.

1132
01:07:07,677 --> 01:07:09,603
The right to use nukes
whenever we see fit.

1133
01:07:09,811 --> 01:07:13,648
- and I guarantee you, Paul,
we will be in a forever war everywhere.

1134
01:07:13,690 --> 01:07:16,068
Three, four wars at a time.

1135
01:07:16,151 --> 01:07:19,196
That's not new world order,
that's a world gone mad.

1136
01:07:19,488 --> 01:07:22,115
There's got to be some
global cooperation here.

1137
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:24,618
No one's against cooperation,
Colin, you know that.

1138
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:28,789
- As long as we're calling the shots.
- Which gets us back to reality.

1139
01:07:28,914 --> 01:07:30,874
Lest we forget...

1140
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,336
...where do you see
a lack of American presence?

1141
01:07:34,503 --> 01:07:36,088
Right in the heart of it all.

1142
01:07:36,171 --> 01:07:37,756
What's missing?

1143
01:07:39,424 --> 01:07:41,093
Iran.

1144
01:07:42,260 --> 01:07:43,386
The mother lode.

1145
01:07:43,595 --> 01:07:46,598
Third largest oil reserve in the world.

1146
01:07:46,723 --> 01:07:49,851
Forty percent of the world's oil...

1147
01:07:49,935 --> 01:07:53,188
...goes right through here,
the Strait of Hormuz.

1148
01:07:53,522 --> 01:07:57,567
Control Iran, control Eurasia,
control the world.

1149
01:07:58,610 --> 01:08:00,487
Empire.

1150
01:08:01,446 --> 01:08:03,698
Real empire.

1151
01:08:04,449 --> 01:08:06,952
Nobody will fuck with us again.

1152
01:08:12,999 --> 01:08:15,627
It's big, Vice.
You know, big thoughts.

1153
01:08:17,879 --> 01:08:21,883
But you go out here and you
scare people when you talk like that.

1154
01:08:21,918 --> 01:08:23,844
The working Joe's
not thinking about oil.

1155
01:08:24,553 --> 01:08:27,472
<i>We're talking 9/11 terrorists...</i>

1156
01:08:27,597 --> 01:08:29,266
...WMDs.

1157
01:08:29,391 --> 01:08:32,727
We're talking
freedom and democracy.

1158
01:08:32,811 --> 01:08:35,105
We're talking Axis of Evil.

1159
01:08:35,230 --> 01:08:36,773
Sir...

1160
01:08:36,982 --> 01:08:39,901
...you have the touch, not I.

1161
01:08:45,740 --> 01:08:47,826
You know,
when I was coming up...

1162
01:08:47,909 --> 01:08:49,995
...it was a dangerous world.

1163
01:08:50,245 --> 01:08:53,456
But we knew exactly
who the "they" were.

1164
01:08:53,582 --> 01:08:57,919
We knew it was us versus them,
and it was clear who "them" was.

1165
01:08:57,961 --> 01:08:59,588
Today...

1166
01:08:59,838 --> 01:09:03,592
...we're not so sure who the "they" are,
but we know they're there.

1167
01:09:04,426 --> 01:09:06,261
Now, I'm not gonna
negotiate with myself.

1168
01:09:06,386 --> 01:09:08,346
I'm a gut player, always have been.

1169
01:09:08,471 --> 01:09:11,391
And I am just so bone-tired
of this Saddam.

1170
01:09:11,516 --> 01:09:13,685
He's always
misunderestimated me.

1171
01:09:13,768 --> 01:09:16,396
I don't want our soldiers
invading in that desert heat.

1172
01:09:16,521 --> 01:09:19,316
We have got to get this war
going before summer, Rummy.

1173
01:09:19,441 --> 01:09:23,194
You say go now, sir, and Tommy
can start mobilizing normally.

1174
01:09:23,229 --> 01:09:25,572
We could have 300,000 troops
in the Gulf...

1175
01:09:25,697 --> 01:09:28,366
...by early January
without creating a stir.

1176
01:09:28,491 --> 01:09:30,577
I want you to keep
a tight lid on it, Rummy.

1177
01:09:30,702 --> 01:09:33,788
For the record, this is against
the spirit of the U.N. resolution.

1178
01:09:33,913 --> 01:09:36,958
We agreed with our allies
to let the inspectors do their jobs.

1179
01:09:36,993 --> 01:09:40,378
As Yogi Berra said,
"Dj vu all over again. "

1180
01:09:41,713 --> 01:09:43,798
Colin, you know what a burn card is?

1181
01:09:43,923 --> 01:09:45,300
No, sir.

1182
01:09:45,467 --> 01:09:48,720
Someday I gotta teach you
how to play some Texas Hold 'Em.

1183
01:09:48,803 --> 01:09:50,889
You keep selling our friends
at the U. N...

1184
01:09:51,014 --> 01:09:54,893
...but whatever they say, in the end,
the final decision is mine.

1185
01:09:54,928 --> 01:09:56,561
Yes, sir.

1186
01:09:56,644 --> 01:09:59,147
Now, are you gonna be with us
on this, Colin, right?

1187
01:10:05,070 --> 01:10:07,405
- I'm with you, sir.
- Good.

1188
01:10:07,989 --> 01:10:10,075
All right, gentlemen,
it's a great meeting.

1189
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:11,242
Best yet.

1190
01:10:11,326 --> 01:10:13,244
Let's close this out.

1191
01:10:28,009 --> 01:10:30,095
Well, you've done
a heck of a job, son.

1192
01:10:30,345 --> 01:10:33,139
Even though I traded Sammy Sosa?

1193
01:10:33,348 --> 01:10:35,642
We all make mistakes.

1194
01:10:36,059 --> 01:10:39,104
Center field. This is my favorite spot
in the world, Poppy.

1195
01:10:39,187 --> 01:10:42,524
You know, whenever things get rough,
when I need to clear my head...

1196
01:10:42,941 --> 01:10:46,486
...I just come out here.
It just makes me feel at peace.

1197
01:10:46,611 --> 01:10:49,405
Right now,
I wish I had a spot like this.

1198
01:10:49,531 --> 01:10:52,117
Not the White House lawn.

1199
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:55,245
This guy Saddam's really put a burr
under your saddle, I guess?

1200
01:10:55,286 --> 01:10:57,622
Saddam, what I call him now.

1201
01:10:57,747 --> 01:11:00,250
If you emphasize the first syllable...

1202
01:11:00,375 --> 01:11:04,003
...it means in Arabic, "the little boy
who shines old men's shoes. "

1203
01:11:04,129 --> 01:11:06,714
Well, he's one shoe-shining
piece of crap, all right.

1204
01:11:06,923 --> 01:11:09,008
He gassed his own people,
the Kurds...

1205
01:11:09,134 --> 01:11:11,302
...invades Kuwait.

1206
01:11:11,386 --> 01:11:14,139
It's time to back him down
and take him out, Poppy.

1207
01:11:14,222 --> 01:11:16,099
You know, like you done Noriega.

1208
01:11:16,224 --> 01:11:17,350
Well, you know...

1209
01:11:17,475 --> 01:11:21,104
...I've always believed in leaving
personal feelings out of politics...

1210
01:11:21,229 --> 01:11:24,190
...but Saddam, this can't stand.

1211
01:11:24,232 --> 01:11:26,526
I'm not gonna let
that little dictator control...

1212
01:11:26,651 --> 01:11:29,153
...one quarter
of the civilized world's oil.

1213
01:11:29,737 --> 01:11:31,322
I got a feeling about this.

1214
01:11:31,823 --> 01:11:33,908
How I handle it...

1215
01:11:34,033 --> 01:11:37,662
...one way or another, is gonna
determine my legacy as president.

1216
01:11:38,329 --> 01:11:41,124
We don't wanna have another draw,
another Vietnam.

1217
01:11:41,165 --> 01:11:43,001
Sloppy ending.

1218
01:11:43,209 --> 01:11:45,920
It's critical I make the right call.

1219
01:11:46,254 --> 01:11:47,672
For myself.

1220
01:11:47,922 --> 01:11:49,340
For the world.

1221
01:11:49,465 --> 01:11:50,592
Well, you will, Poppy.

1222
01:11:50,842 --> 01:11:51,843
I'm sure.

1223
01:11:51,968 --> 01:11:54,262
You know, just don't think about it
too much...

1224
01:11:54,345 --> 01:11:56,556
...because it just screws you all up.

1225
01:11:57,682 --> 01:11:59,684
Sorry to hear about
Selig screwing you.

1226
01:11:59,767 --> 01:12:00,727
No.

1227
01:12:00,852 --> 01:12:03,855
I was a dang fool thinking
he'd ever make me commissioner.

1228
01:12:03,938 --> 01:12:07,525
He was just jerking my chain,
keeping the job warm for himself.

1229
01:12:07,609 --> 01:12:09,694
You own a baseball team.

1230
01:12:09,819 --> 01:12:12,196
Spare yourself the headache.

1231
01:12:13,781 --> 01:12:16,576
It may be better
you stay out of the barrel.

1232
01:12:17,285 --> 01:12:18,453
What do you mean?

1233
01:12:20,455 --> 01:12:22,206
Just better.

1234
01:12:25,460 --> 01:12:26,878
So how's Jeb?

1235
01:12:27,086 --> 01:12:30,465
You know, I think your brother's
actually gonna be governor of Florida.

1236
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:32,550
- I really do.
- You don't say.

1237
01:12:32,634 --> 01:12:34,385
He's always had that ambition.

1238
01:12:34,636 --> 01:12:36,929
Oh, who knows these things.

1239
01:12:37,013 --> 01:12:38,556
But that kid could...

1240
01:12:38,681 --> 01:12:41,100
Well, one day...

1241
01:12:41,184 --> 01:12:43,561
...he could even be president.

1242
01:12:44,646 --> 01:12:46,064
Gotta be getting back.

1243
01:12:46,397 --> 01:12:47,565
Nice seeing you, son.

1244
01:12:47,732 --> 01:12:49,942
You keep it up.

1245
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:53,696
And I'll throw out that first ball
when you need me.

1246
01:12:57,158 --> 01:12:59,243
<i>In facing down
Saddam Hussein...</i>

1247
01:12:59,327 --> 01:13:02,747
<i>...President Bush has rewritten
the book on crisis management.</i>

1248
01:13:02,872 --> 01:13:06,501
<i>The temporary cease-fire
would become formal in 48 hours...</i>

1249
01:13:06,626 --> 01:13:09,921
<i>...if Iraq releases all POWs
and Kuwaiti detainees.</i>

1250
01:13:09,962 --> 01:13:14,133
<i>For all intents and purposes,
Operation Desert Storm has ended.</i>

1251
01:13:14,175 --> 01:13:15,676
<i>A smashing victory for the Allies.</i>

1252
01:13:15,927 --> 01:13:18,513
<i>A crushing and embarrassing defeat
for Iraq.</i>

1253
01:13:18,638 --> 01:13:20,723
<i>The Iraqi POWs march
with their hands up...</i>

1254
01:13:20,932 --> 01:13:24,894
<i>...trudging past burning oil fields
and abandoned defensive positions.</i>

1255
01:13:24,929 --> 01:13:27,271
Gentlemen, well done.

1256
01:13:27,355 --> 01:13:29,148
Dick, could you and Colin stay?

1257
01:13:29,273 --> 01:13:31,234
Congratulations, general.

1258
01:13:32,610 --> 01:13:34,153
Good job.

1259
01:13:41,869 --> 01:13:44,872
A hundred hours, my gosh.

1260
01:13:45,289 --> 01:13:49,043
I guess we finally kicked
that Vietnam syndrome.

1261
01:13:49,168 --> 01:13:51,879
It makes you wanna go all the way
to Baghdad, doesn't it?

1262
01:13:52,004 --> 01:13:54,590
Probably get there in two days.

1263
01:13:55,299 --> 01:13:58,845
But to be an occupying power
in an Arab land...

1264
01:13:58,970 --> 01:14:00,555
...the coalition would fall apart.

1265
01:14:01,139 --> 01:14:04,725
We'd be out there all alone.
Mission creep.

1266
01:14:04,809 --> 01:14:08,354
Going after Saddam,
we'd turn him into a hero.

1267
01:14:08,688 --> 01:14:10,231
That's not our job.

1268
01:14:10,314 --> 01:14:13,442
And how many Americans
is Iraq worth?

1269
01:14:13,568 --> 01:14:15,987
You got an election in November.

1270
01:14:17,238 --> 01:14:18,573
No.

1271
01:14:19,115 --> 01:14:20,992
Gone far enough.

1272
01:14:22,118 --> 01:14:23,494
Nice job, fellas.

1273
01:14:24,203 --> 01:14:26,581
Cleanest war in history.

1274
01:14:26,831 --> 01:14:28,374
Proud of you.

1275
01:14:29,333 --> 01:14:32,336
This is the proudest day
of my presidency.

1276
01:14:39,427 --> 01:14:41,929
<i>Governor Clinton
is now President-Elect Bill Clinton.</i>

1277
01:14:42,054 --> 01:14:43,931
<i>He has won this presidential race...</i>

1278
01:14:44,140 --> 01:14:46,309
<i>...along with his running mate,
Senator Al Gore.</i>

1279
01:14:46,434 --> 01:14:48,895
<i>In spite of his overwhelming victory
in Iraq...</i>

1280
01:14:49,020 --> 01:14:52,106
<i>...the people did not return
George Bush to the White House.</i>

1281
01:14:52,148 --> 01:14:55,693
<i>A stunning reversal of fortune
for an aristocrat of politics...</i>

1282
01:14:55,776 --> 01:14:58,821
<i>...whose long career was
overshadowed by a bad economy...</i>

1283
01:14:58,946 --> 01:15:03,117
<i>...a third-party candidate, Ross Perot,
and a secret war in Nicaragua.</i>

1284
01:15:03,152 --> 01:15:06,203
<i>All of which may have combined
to undo...</i>

1285
01:15:07,997 --> 01:15:11,250
The best person didn't win tonight.

1286
01:15:11,626 --> 01:15:15,087
The best man did not win, George.

1287
01:15:17,381 --> 01:15:19,258
He's so beneath you.

1288
01:15:19,383 --> 01:15:21,761
He doesn't deserve to be president.

1289
01:15:21,886 --> 01:15:25,389
And he wouldn't be
if it wasn't for the damn media.

1290
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:27,808
You were a great president, Poppy.

1291
01:15:27,934 --> 01:15:29,685
Great president.

1292
01:15:33,022 --> 01:15:35,399
I gave it all I could.

1293
01:15:38,653 --> 01:15:41,656
I thought the war
would have carried us.

1294
01:15:52,833 --> 01:15:54,293
Well...

1295
01:15:54,919 --> 01:15:58,339
...if you just would've clobbered
the son of a bitch, you know?

1296
01:15:59,507 --> 01:16:00,841
- What?
- You know, I mean...

1297
01:16:00,966 --> 01:16:03,886
...gone all the way to Baghdad.
Cleaned his clock.

1298
01:16:06,597 --> 01:16:08,474
Has he been imbibing
something I don't...?

1299
01:16:08,599 --> 01:16:11,727
Don't start. Don't start that.
I'm talking about decisiveness.

1300
01:16:11,811 --> 01:16:13,479
Finishing.
Everything I've been told.

1301
01:16:13,604 --> 01:16:17,358
Okay, that's it. You can stop right now.
Just zip it up, and I mean it.

1302
01:16:17,393 --> 01:16:18,484
I won that war.

1303
01:16:18,693 --> 01:16:20,861
Of course you did, Poppy.

1304
01:16:21,404 --> 01:16:23,280
Of course you did.

1305
01:16:24,615 --> 01:16:27,243
Can you all leave, please,
for a moment? Thank you.

1306
01:16:27,368 --> 01:16:32,665
<i>- and this is the first indication
of jubilation in Little Rock, Arkansas.</i>

1307
01:16:32,706 --> 01:16:34,667
- What was that about?
- Damned if I know.

1308
01:16:34,750 --> 01:16:36,961
I've never seen him like this before.

1309
01:16:37,670 --> 01:16:40,297
Well, it's hard, you know?
He knows this is the end.

1310
01:16:40,381 --> 01:16:44,135
You know what? If he would've listened
to me, he'd have pulverized Clinton.

1311
01:16:44,218 --> 01:16:47,763
I mean, I wish he had more of Mom
in him because he's weak in spirit.

1312
01:16:47,888 --> 01:16:50,891
That's the difference maker.
He doesn't believe like I believe.

1313
01:16:51,016 --> 01:16:52,476
That is not what this is about.

1314
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:55,062
It's his health,
all the medications he's taking.

1315
01:16:55,187 --> 01:16:57,606
He's just tired, and he's old.

1316
01:16:57,690 --> 01:16:59,233
I can't watch him like this.

1317
01:16:59,358 --> 01:17:02,069
You know, it hurts too damn much
to lose.

1318
01:17:02,278 --> 01:17:05,322
I'd never let this happen to me.
Never.

1319
01:17:15,207 --> 01:17:17,168
Governor of Texas?

1320
01:17:17,293 --> 01:17:18,836
You must be joking.

1321
01:17:20,004 --> 01:17:21,255
No, I'm dead serious.

1322
01:17:21,338 --> 01:17:24,592
Well, how are you gonna beat
Ann Richards? She's way too popular.

1323
01:17:24,717 --> 01:17:27,178
Look, Ann Richards
is way too liberal for Texas.

1324
01:17:27,303 --> 01:17:29,597
Karl's done the polls.
He says I can beat her.

1325
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:31,682
I'm gonna make
Miss Big-Mouth-Big-Hair...

1326
01:17:31,765 --> 01:17:33,976
...pay for the things
she said about Poppy.

1327
01:17:34,101 --> 01:17:35,728
Leave it alone.

1328
01:17:35,853 --> 01:17:37,605
Besides, I won that campaign.

1329
01:17:37,730 --> 01:17:40,441
What's at issue...?
This isn't fair to Jeb.

1330
01:17:40,524 --> 01:17:42,943
He's already running
for governor of Florida.

1331
01:17:43,027 --> 01:17:46,071
- One Bush at a time, son.
- I'm not looking to steal his heat.

1332
01:17:46,155 --> 01:17:49,200
How do you expect us to go
campaigning for both of you?

1333
01:17:49,283 --> 01:17:52,036
I'm not asking you to.

1334
01:17:52,119 --> 01:17:54,955
Laura, how do you feel
about all of this, truthfully?

1335
01:17:54,990 --> 01:17:56,290
W knows how I feel.

1336
01:17:56,498 --> 01:17:59,543
Look, you don't understand.
I've already made up my mind.

1337
01:17:59,627 --> 01:18:03,297
So you're not asking us,
you're telling us.

1338
01:18:03,332 --> 01:18:05,674
The fact is, you can't win.

1339
01:18:05,799 --> 01:18:07,343
Why do you say that?

1340
01:18:07,885 --> 01:18:10,054
Because you're too much like me.

1341
01:18:10,137 --> 01:18:12,765
You're loud
and you got a short fuse.

1342
01:18:12,890 --> 01:18:15,559
Now, Jeb is like your father.

1343
01:18:15,684 --> 01:18:17,227
He thinks before he speaks.

1344
01:18:17,353 --> 01:18:19,313
He's got his feet on the ground.

1345
01:18:19,438 --> 01:18:23,317
- Barb, don't be so hard on him.
- Well, he knows it's the truth.

1346
01:18:24,151 --> 01:18:26,737
I'm not gonna say something
I'm liable to regret here.

1347
01:18:26,820 --> 01:18:30,282
Son, just consider holding off
until '98.

1348
01:18:30,324 --> 01:18:33,744
You won't have Richards
to contend with.

1349
01:18:33,827 --> 01:18:36,205
We'll be able to give you
our undivided support.

1350
01:18:36,330 --> 01:18:37,706
No, no, I get it. I get it.

1351
01:18:37,915 --> 01:18:40,084
You want Jeb
to get elected before me.

1352
01:18:40,167 --> 01:18:44,213
Come off it.
It's a matter of practicality, of timing.

1353
01:18:44,254 --> 01:18:48,217
I want you both to have
what you want, what you deserve.

1354
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:53,514
Well, I'm running this time, Poppy.

1355
01:18:53,555 --> 01:18:55,182
You hear me?

1356
01:18:55,432 --> 01:18:56,767
I'm running now.

1357
01:18:56,850 --> 01:18:58,936
Here they come.
They'll be bringing the heat.

1358
01:19:00,312 --> 01:19:01,772
I know, don't swing at anything
I can't hit.

1359
01:19:01,855 --> 01:19:04,066
Mr. Bush, you didn't talk much
about education.

1360
01:19:04,191 --> 01:19:05,734
What are your plans for reform?

1361
01:19:05,859 --> 01:19:08,112
Well, I'm gonna deregulate
school districts...

1362
01:19:08,237 --> 01:19:10,114
...so that teachers
and administrators...

1363
01:19:10,322 --> 01:19:12,700
...can develop programs
that best fit their kids.

1364
01:19:12,825 --> 01:19:15,494
How are you proposing
to measure students' progress?

1365
01:19:15,536 --> 01:19:20,332
Well, we need to make a wholesale
effort against racial profiling...

1366
01:19:20,374 --> 01:19:21,792
...which is illiterate children.

1367
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,794
You need to teach a child to read...

1368
01:19:23,877 --> 01:19:26,463
...then he or her will be able
to pass a literacy test.

1369
01:19:26,588 --> 01:19:29,299
We're in the very early stages
of developing our program.

1370
01:19:29,383 --> 01:19:32,136
How do you plan
to change the school finance formula?

1371
01:19:32,219 --> 01:19:35,055
I for one will not stand
for the subsidation of failure.

1372
01:19:35,090 --> 01:19:36,890
How do you know
if you don't measure up...

1373
01:19:37,141 --> 01:19:39,810
...if you have a system
that simply suckles them through?

1374
01:19:39,852 --> 01:19:41,311
What about our failed schools?

1375
01:19:41,478 --> 01:19:45,149
- Think the state needs to take over?
- More government's not the answer.

1376
01:19:45,190 --> 01:19:47,735
We must have the attitude
that every child in America...

1377
01:19:47,860 --> 01:19:50,487
...regardless of where they're raised,
can learn.

1378
01:19:50,571 --> 01:19:52,990
You know,
rarely is the question asked:

1379
01:19:53,073 --> 01:19:55,075
"Is our children learning?"

1380
01:19:55,159 --> 01:19:58,287
Okay, fellas, that's it. We'll see you
at the next campaign stop.

1381
01:19:58,412 --> 01:20:02,166
- Mr. Bush. Mr. Bush. Mr. Bush.
- No more. Adis. Adis. Adis.

1382
01:20:02,201 --> 01:20:03,917
"Suckles"?

1383
01:20:04,126 --> 01:20:06,003
Look, you're the son of a president.

1384
01:20:06,086 --> 01:20:07,754
You graduated Yale.

1385
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:10,174
You went to Harvard,
got a business degree.

1386
01:20:10,257 --> 01:20:13,510
If you can't stand in front of those guys
for two minutes...

1387
01:20:13,635 --> 01:20:16,221
...and come up
with one plausible answer...

1388
01:20:16,305 --> 01:20:18,849
...then what the hell
are we running for governor for?

1389
01:20:18,884 --> 01:20:21,518
Just tell me what to do.
Whatever it takes.

1390
01:20:21,643 --> 01:20:25,105
Look, if I need to read the
whole damn Constitution, I'll learn it.

1391
01:20:25,189 --> 01:20:27,774
Okay, four food groups.

1392
01:20:27,900 --> 01:20:30,319
Crime, education,
tort reform, welfare.

1393
01:20:30,402 --> 01:20:33,197
And if they ask you what time of day
it is, what do you say?

1394
01:20:33,447 --> 01:20:35,073
We must teach our children to read.

1395
01:20:35,199 --> 01:20:36,241
What about welfare?

1396
01:20:36,366 --> 01:20:39,036
We must hold the fathers
and the unwed mothers accountable.

1397
01:20:39,244 --> 01:20:41,538
- Because we love babies.
- Because we love babies.

1398
01:20:41,663 --> 01:20:43,040
Crime?

1399
01:20:43,415 --> 01:20:47,002
End early release and all paroles
for rapists and child molesters.

1400
01:20:47,085 --> 01:20:50,547
Citizens got the right to carry
a handgun for self-protection.

1401
01:20:50,964 --> 01:20:53,634
My opponent disagrees about that.

1402
01:20:53,842 --> 01:20:56,887
But Texas got the highest rate
of murders in the country.

1403
01:20:56,970 --> 01:20:59,514
And still Miss Richards' hair
is in the clouds.

1404
01:20:59,598 --> 01:21:02,392
She doesn't believe the citizens
got to protect themselves.

1405
01:21:02,517 --> 01:21:04,478
If you believe that,
vote for my opponent.

1406
01:21:04,603 --> 01:21:06,897
Okay, so, what about
that swagger of yours?

1407
01:21:07,105 --> 01:21:10,692
- In Texas, we call that walking.
- Drinking, drugs, your past?

1408
01:21:10,734 --> 01:21:14,321
It was a mistake. I was young.
That's all I'm gonna say about that.

1409
01:21:14,404 --> 01:21:17,324
I don't wanna give your
14-year-old child the excuse to say:

1410
01:21:17,407 --> 01:21:20,035
"If old Governor Bush done it,
maybe I can do it too. "

1411
01:21:20,077 --> 01:21:21,828
- Hey, George.
- Hey, girls. How are you?

1412
01:21:21,995 --> 01:21:24,206
- Good luck on your campaign.
- Thank you.

1413
01:21:24,331 --> 01:21:26,166
- Hope you win.
- Vote for me, don't forget.

1414
01:21:26,291 --> 01:21:27,334
Yes, sir.

1415
01:21:27,417 --> 01:21:31,088
What do you say to, "George W. Bush
is a rich, spoiled jerk.

1416
01:21:31,171 --> 01:21:33,173
His wealth was produced
by stock swaps...

1417
01:21:33,256 --> 01:21:35,550
...and bailouts arranged
by his daddy"?

1418
01:21:35,676 --> 01:21:37,636
Ann Richards can badmouth me
all she wants.

1419
01:21:37,761 --> 01:21:39,721
I've created
successful small businesses.

1420
01:21:39,846 --> 01:21:41,515
I run a Major League baseball team.

1421
01:21:41,723 --> 01:21:44,810
I'm in touch with real people in Texas.

1422
01:21:44,851 --> 01:21:47,020
I work with them every day
at the ball park.

1423
01:21:47,145 --> 01:21:51,441
Talk to the fans, hot dog vendors.
Get to know what they think.

1424
01:21:51,525 --> 01:21:54,076
Because truly, deep down inside...

1425
01:21:54,111 --> 01:21:56,613
...you know I'm a guy like you,
a guy you can trust.

1426
01:21:56,738 --> 01:21:59,032
Fabulous. Fabulous, W.

1427
01:21:59,116 --> 01:22:00,701
What it all comes down to...

1428
01:22:00,909 --> 01:22:04,454
...is who Joe Voter wants to sit down
and have a beer with.

1429
01:22:04,496 --> 01:22:05,789
And guess who that is.

1430
01:22:06,039 --> 01:22:08,000
Just remember
to make mine nonalcoholic.

1431
01:22:08,125 --> 01:22:11,003
So anything about the issues,
you come to me first.

1432
01:22:11,128 --> 01:22:12,879
I'll tell you what to say.

1433
01:22:13,005 --> 01:22:15,090
You're not gonna tell me
what to say, Karl.

1434
01:22:15,173 --> 01:22:17,718
I'm gonna tell you what I want.
You're the word man.

1435
01:22:17,801 --> 01:22:19,970
This campaign
starts and ends with me.

1436
01:22:20,095 --> 01:22:23,140
You got it, W. I'm just a little fairy...

1437
01:22:23,223 --> 01:22:26,560
...putting down
a little magic dust for you.

1438
01:22:26,768 --> 01:22:28,437
And, Karl...

1439
01:22:28,645 --> 01:22:31,481
...this time I'm gonna
out-Texas Texas.

1440
01:22:35,944 --> 01:22:38,864
Your father's here to see you,
governor.

1441
01:22:38,989 --> 01:22:40,741
Poppy's here right now?

1442
01:22:40,824 --> 01:22:42,826
- All right, send him in, Evie.
- Governor.

1443
01:22:42,909 --> 01:22:44,578
Yeah. You like that, don't you?

1444
01:22:44,828 --> 01:22:46,163
Put your pants on.

1445
01:22:48,331 --> 01:22:51,084
- How are you, son?
- Hey, Poppy, sorry.

1446
01:22:52,210 --> 01:22:53,253
Got your speech ready?

1447
01:22:53,336 --> 01:22:55,839
Yeah, I was just getting ready
to go over it again.

1448
01:22:55,964 --> 01:22:58,258
This is a moment you'll never forget...

1449
01:22:58,383 --> 01:23:00,677
...being inaugurated for the first time.

1450
01:23:00,761 --> 01:23:03,680
Try and take a photograph
in your mind...

1451
01:23:03,764 --> 01:23:07,434
...so you can savor it
when the times get tough...

1452
01:23:07,476 --> 01:23:09,603
...as they always do.

1453
01:23:10,020 --> 01:23:12,856
All right, well, I'll try and do that.

1454
01:23:14,858 --> 01:23:17,235
Yeah, I sure am glad
that Jeb's coming.

1455
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:20,030
I'm gonna acknowledge him
in my speech.

1456
01:23:21,907 --> 01:23:25,494
It's been hard on him,
the loss.

1457
01:23:25,785 --> 01:23:28,497
I wish I could've been
at his inauguration too.

1458
01:23:29,331 --> 01:23:30,790
It would've been something.

1459
01:23:30,874 --> 01:23:33,835
Why do you just feel bad about Jeb?

1460
01:23:35,378 --> 01:23:37,672
Why don't you feel good about me?

1461
01:23:38,381 --> 01:23:41,134
Well, of course I do.

1462
01:23:41,218 --> 01:23:42,761
And...

1463
01:23:48,642 --> 01:23:50,727
I brought you these.

1464
01:23:53,104 --> 01:23:55,398
They were your grandfather's.

1465
01:23:56,316 --> 01:23:59,361
The only real thing he ever gave me.

1466
01:24:03,406 --> 01:24:05,116
Wear them well.

1467
01:24:12,165 --> 01:24:14,793
See you at the inauguration, son.

1468
01:24:20,423 --> 01:24:23,009
Well, what did he have to say?

1469
01:24:26,471 --> 01:24:30,016
"These cufflinks
are my most treasured possession.

1470
01:24:30,141 --> 01:24:35,105
My father, Prescott, gave them to me
right after I came back from the war.

1471
01:24:35,146 --> 01:24:36,898
They were mine.
Now they are yours.

1472
01:24:36,982 --> 01:24:39,192
I'm sure you will make
a fine governor. "

1473
01:24:39,276 --> 01:24:41,152
It's nice, W.

1474
01:24:41,486 --> 01:24:44,614
You think he might ever be able
to say something direct to me...

1475
01:24:44,739 --> 01:24:47,117
- ... instead of using these notes?
- This is his way.

1476
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:50,662
- You think he might be happy with me?
- Hon, he is.

1477
01:24:50,704 --> 01:24:52,747
Let me help you.

1478
01:24:59,713 --> 01:25:01,214
Well, Jebby, that's just great.

1479
01:25:01,297 --> 01:25:04,843
Keep Florida warm. You say hi
to Columba and the kids for me.

1480
01:25:04,968 --> 01:25:07,137
Governor, the reverend.

1481
01:25:07,679 --> 01:25:09,222
Yeah, we'll talk later.

1482
01:25:09,639 --> 01:25:10,807
- Earle.
- Governor.

1483
01:25:10,974 --> 01:25:12,892
- Hey, thanks a bunch for coming.
- Yeah.

1484
01:25:12,976 --> 01:25:16,104
Hey, go ahead, take a seat.
Make yourself comfortable.

1485
01:25:16,604 --> 01:25:19,190
- Hey, how's the show coming along?
- Couldn't be better.

1486
01:25:19,232 --> 01:25:23,194
Over 100 million Americans
are watching the Earle Hudd Hour...

1487
01:25:23,319 --> 01:25:25,697
- ... right here in North America.
- Fabulous.

1488
01:25:25,822 --> 01:25:29,117
You don't say. That's great.
That's dandy, Earle.

1489
01:25:30,285 --> 01:25:32,704
So, listen...

1490
01:25:32,787 --> 01:25:37,667
...I asked you here today to discuss
something of great importance.

1491
01:25:39,753 --> 01:25:41,337
I've heard the call.

1492
01:25:41,421 --> 01:25:42,589
Well, I know.

1493
01:25:42,797 --> 01:25:45,800
Don't forget, I've been the witness
to the growth in your faith.

1494
01:25:45,925 --> 01:25:48,344
No, that's not what I mean.

1495
01:25:48,428 --> 01:25:50,305
I mean, I've heard the call.

1496
01:25:50,430 --> 01:25:53,767
And I believe that God
wants me to run for president.

1497
01:26:00,315 --> 01:26:02,609
- Truly?
- I can't explain it.

1498
01:26:02,692 --> 01:26:05,028
But I think that something
is gonna happen.

1499
01:26:05,111 --> 01:26:08,031
And at that time,
my country is gonna need me.

1500
01:26:08,156 --> 01:26:11,451
And, you know,
I think it's part of a divine plan.

1501
01:26:11,576 --> 01:26:14,913
Well, a man don't
hear the call, governor...

1502
01:26:14,996 --> 01:26:17,207
...unless the good Lord wants him to.

1503
01:26:17,290 --> 01:26:19,083
The truth is I don't wanna run.

1504
01:26:19,167 --> 01:26:22,420
I mean, it's like Moses. I mean,
he wasn't a very good speaker.

1505
01:26:22,545 --> 01:26:25,048
But finally, he just knew.

1506
01:26:25,131 --> 01:26:28,551
My father was president,
the whole family was affected by it.

1507
01:26:28,593 --> 01:26:30,470
I know the price.

1508
01:26:30,637 --> 01:26:34,098
I'd be happy just buying
my fishing lures at Wal-Mart.

1509
01:26:34,224 --> 01:26:38,144
And if I run for president,
I know my life will never be the same.

1510
01:26:38,186 --> 01:26:41,606
But I feel
that God wants me to do this, Earle.

1511
01:26:41,731 --> 01:26:43,816
And I must do it.

1512
01:26:44,192 --> 01:26:45,902
I must.

1513
01:26:49,531 --> 01:26:51,741
Well, then, you must, son.

1514
01:26:52,534 --> 01:26:55,912
- I'd like to pray over it.
- Yeah, thank you.

1515
01:26:58,081 --> 01:26:59,832
Dear Lord...

1516
01:27:00,291 --> 01:27:02,752
...we pray that you will watch over...

1517
01:27:02,877 --> 01:27:08,716
...and always shine your light on
our humble servant George W. Bush.

1518
01:27:08,758 --> 01:27:10,718
In Jesus' name.

1519
01:27:10,802 --> 01:27:12,470
Amen.

1520
01:27:12,595 --> 01:27:14,013
Amen.

1521
01:27:18,101 --> 01:27:20,186
Last draft. I promise.

1522
01:27:21,729 --> 01:27:24,691
Yellowcake again.
I've read how many of these?

1523
01:27:24,774 --> 01:27:28,611
I'm burned out. I've gotta get some
sack time. Have my guy check it out.

1524
01:27:35,118 --> 01:27:37,287
We finally got it in.

1525
01:27:37,370 --> 01:27:39,914
Page eight. Uranium in Africa.

1526
01:27:39,998 --> 01:27:41,541
Took long enough.

1527
01:27:41,666 --> 01:27:45,128
British Government has learned
that Saddam Hussein...

1528
01:27:45,211 --> 01:27:50,425
...recently sought significant quantities
of uranium in Africa.

1529
01:27:50,633 --> 01:27:52,510
Our intelligence sources tells us...

1530
01:27:52,802 --> 01:27:56,139
...that he has attempted to purchase
high-strength aluminum tubes...

1531
01:27:56,472 --> 01:27:59,475
<i>...suitable for
nuclear-weapons production.</i>

1532
01:27:59,726 --> 01:28:02,103
<i>Evidence from intelligence sources...</i>

1533
01:28:02,228 --> 01:28:05,440
<i>...and secret communications
from people now in custody...</i>

1534
01:28:05,982 --> 01:28:08,234
...reveal that Saddam Hussein...

1535
01:28:08,359 --> 01:28:10,862
...aids and protects terrorists.

1536
01:28:10,987 --> 01:28:13,865
Including members of al Qaeda.

1537
01:28:14,907 --> 01:28:17,452
<i>Imagine those 19 hijackers...</i>

1538
01:28:17,535 --> 01:28:20,663
<i>...with other weapons
and other plans...</i>

1539
01:28:20,747 --> 01:28:23,499
<i>...this time armed
by Saddam Hussein.</i>

1540
01:28:24,292 --> 01:28:27,628
<i>It would take one bomb,
one canister...</i>

1541
01:28:27,670 --> 01:28:29,964
<i>...one crate slipped into this country...</i>

1542
01:28:30,673 --> 01:28:34,635
<i>...to bring a day of horror
like none we have ever known.</i>

1543
01:28:34,677 --> 01:28:37,972
<i>Facing clear evidence of peril...</i>

1544
01:28:38,389 --> 01:28:41,434
<i>...we cannot wait for the final proof...</i>

1545
01:28:41,601 --> 01:28:46,856
<i>...the smoking gun that can come
in the form of a mushroom cloud.</i>

1546
01:28:48,524 --> 01:28:52,278
<i>The liberty we prize
is not America's gift to the world.</i>

1547
01:28:52,904 --> 01:28:55,698
It is God's gift to humanity.

1548
01:29:06,209 --> 01:29:10,463
Every nation and every region
has a decision to make.

1549
01:29:10,505 --> 01:29:14,675
Either you're with us
or you're with the terrorists.

1550
01:29:27,897 --> 01:29:29,816
May he guide us now.

1551
01:29:29,899 --> 01:29:34,904
And may God continue to bless
the United States of America.

1552
01:30:16,529 --> 01:30:19,448
Why don't you take
your sleeping pill?

1553
01:30:19,615 --> 01:30:21,617
Clouds coming in.

1554
01:30:21,701 --> 01:30:23,703
Looks like rain.

1555
01:30:24,036 --> 01:30:25,580
Come on.

1556
01:30:25,997 --> 01:30:31,002
You're not sitting here at 3 a. m.
thinking about the weather.

1557
01:30:31,294 --> 01:30:33,588
Remind me to call the electrician
in the morning.

1558
01:30:33,713 --> 01:30:35,590
There's a light out on the path below.

1559
01:30:35,673 --> 01:30:39,051
Why don't you call your son
and tell him what's on your mind...

1560
01:30:39,135 --> 01:30:41,012
...what's keeping you awake all night?

1561
01:30:41,137 --> 01:30:42,888
I'm worried about him.

1562
01:30:44,974 --> 01:30:46,851
Really worried.

1563
01:30:48,644 --> 01:30:51,022
I can't talk to him.

1564
01:30:51,564 --> 01:30:54,150
Well, he's not gonna listen to me.

1565
01:30:54,233 --> 01:30:57,820
He takes criticism worse than I do.

1566
01:30:58,029 --> 01:31:00,197
He's the president now.

1567
01:31:00,323 --> 01:31:02,575
His decision to make.

1568
01:31:03,117 --> 01:31:04,577
Well...

1569
01:31:04,994 --> 01:31:06,579
...you better do something.

1570
01:31:06,662 --> 01:31:09,373
This is eating away at you.

1571
01:31:12,293 --> 01:31:14,170
I'll do something.

1572
01:31:15,087 --> 01:31:16,672
"An attack on Iraq at this time...

1573
01:31:16,881 --> 01:31:20,092
...would seriously jeopardize
the global counterterrorist campaign...

1574
01:31:20,217 --> 01:31:22,178
...we have undertaken.
And would result...

1575
01:31:22,303 --> 01:31:25,514
...in a serious degradation
in international cooperation with us...

1576
01:31:25,556 --> 01:31:27,600
...against terrorism. "

1577
01:31:30,436 --> 01:31:32,313
Damn Brent Scowcroft.

1578
01:31:32,438 --> 01:31:35,024
He wouldn't be doing this
unless my father approved it.

1579
01:31:35,107 --> 01:31:37,026
You know, Poppy's good friend.

1580
01:31:37,109 --> 01:31:39,278
These 1980 guys trying to
tell me what to do...

1581
01:31:39,403 --> 01:31:41,197
...when they don't know what I know.

1582
01:31:41,280 --> 01:31:43,783
Just when we want the U.N.
and the Democrats in this.

1583
01:31:43,866 --> 01:31:46,285
I will call Brent right now.

1584
01:31:46,368 --> 01:31:48,454
He can't even talk to me directly
like a man.

1585
01:31:48,579 --> 01:31:51,373
Writing letters. I don't wanna
get anything like this again.

1586
01:31:51,499 --> 01:31:55,252
I will let Brent know that from here
on out, he's persona non grata.

1587
01:31:55,294 --> 01:31:56,712
This is my war, not his.

1588
01:31:56,921 --> 01:31:59,298
I will not renegotiate this.

1589
01:31:59,423 --> 01:32:00,549
Mr. President.

1590
01:32:01,383 --> 01:32:05,888
Has your father ever personally
offered you advice on Iraq?

1591
01:32:05,930 --> 01:32:08,182
No, I haven't asked. I don't need to.

1592
01:32:08,307 --> 01:32:10,476
Wrong father to appeal to
in terms of strength.

1593
01:32:10,559 --> 01:32:13,312
You know, there's a higher father
I appeal to.

1594
01:32:13,395 --> 01:32:15,064
Amen.

1595
01:32:18,067 --> 01:32:19,860
<i>Protestors came
by the thousands...</i>

1596
01:32:19,985 --> 01:32:23,489
<i>...filling block after block around
the United Nations to make a single...</i>

1597
01:32:25,407 --> 01:32:29,453
<i>These are the largest anti-war
demonstrations ever seen in history.</i>

1598
01:32:32,998 --> 01:32:37,086
<i>Some of our allies were very much
against this operation.</i>

1599
01:32:37,121 --> 01:32:38,629
Bush, Bush.

1600
01:32:38,838 --> 01:32:42,800
<i>Estimates of 10 to 15 million
protestors across the planet...</i>

1601
01:32:42,842 --> 01:32:46,345
<i>...protesting America's
pro-war policies in Iraq.</i>

1602
01:32:48,097 --> 01:32:51,267
<i>Tens of thousands demonstrating
all over the world...</i>

1603
01:32:54,478 --> 01:32:57,690
So I suppose the key here,
George, is to go back to the U.N.

1604
01:32:57,815 --> 01:33:01,569
Tony, I'm with you, but I'm flat out of
wrestling moves with these U.N. types.

1605
01:33:01,610 --> 01:33:03,779
Even Powell doesn't think
we can get it through.

1606
01:33:03,863 --> 01:33:06,574
Believe me, I am twisting
my own set of arms at the U.N.

1607
01:33:06,699 --> 01:33:09,368
- All right.
- But I still think...

1608
01:33:09,493 --> 01:33:13,873
...France, Germany, Russia,
we can make a deal.

1609
01:33:13,914 --> 01:33:16,166
Well, our new thinking
is shaping on that.

1610
01:33:16,292 --> 01:33:17,960
- Yeah.
- Which is?

1611
01:33:18,043 --> 01:33:20,462
Punish France.
Ignore Germany.

1612
01:33:20,546 --> 01:33:22,214
Forgive Russia.

1613
01:33:22,423 --> 01:33:26,885
Yes, but with time, just a few months,
much will become clearer.

1614
01:33:26,927 --> 01:33:28,387
No, we can't do that, Tony.

1615
01:33:28,470 --> 01:33:31,890
We run out of time. The start date
for the war is penciled in. March 10.

1616
01:33:32,016 --> 01:33:33,392
March 10th.

1617
01:33:33,475 --> 01:33:37,229
George, the inspectors
haven't found anything yet.

1618
01:33:37,313 --> 01:33:39,106
How can we justify
a preemptive attack?

1619
01:33:39,231 --> 01:33:42,151
Well, no WMDs yet, Tony,
but we know they got them.

1620
01:33:42,234 --> 01:33:44,653
- Absolutely.
- So it just might come down to us...

1621
01:33:44,737 --> 01:33:47,239
...having to provoke the son of a bitch.

1622
01:33:47,281 --> 01:33:48,699
Well, what do you have in mind?

1623
01:33:48,907 --> 01:33:52,661
We were thinking of painting one of
our U-2 recon planes in U.N. colors...

1624
01:33:52,703 --> 01:33:53,829
...and fly it over Iraq.

1625
01:33:53,996 --> 01:33:57,875
Now, if Saddam takes the bait,
which, knowing him, he will...

1626
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:01,003
Well, when he fires on it,
he'll be in breach of 1441.

1627
01:34:01,086 --> 01:34:03,714
That would sure justify retaliation.

1628
01:34:04,256 --> 01:34:06,091
Well, it's a novel idea.

1629
01:34:06,216 --> 01:34:08,093
Let's hope it doesn't come to that.

1630
01:34:08,177 --> 01:34:09,345
Tony...

1631
01:34:09,428 --> 01:34:12,681
...come the U.N.
second resolution or not...

1632
01:34:12,765 --> 01:34:14,975
...we're going to war on this.

1633
01:34:15,100 --> 01:34:16,643
Are you?

1634
01:34:24,276 --> 01:34:27,780
<i>I do not share your spirit
for why we need war.</i>

1635
01:34:28,030 --> 01:34:29,698
<i>War is not inevitable.</i>

1636
01:34:29,782 --> 01:34:33,827
<i>There are alternative ways
to reach goals.</i>

1637
01:34:33,869 --> 01:34:36,663
<i>I mean, it's a question of morality,
George.</i>

1638
01:34:36,789 --> 01:34:39,583
Well, Jacques,
St. Augustine wrote about that.

1639
01:34:39,708 --> 01:34:42,711
Said there was such a thing
as just war.

1640
01:34:45,547 --> 01:34:48,133
Listen, Jacques,
I'm committed to our relationship.

1641
01:34:48,217 --> 01:34:49,802
<i>- So am I.
- I'm responsible for...</i>

1642
01:34:49,885 --> 01:34:52,930
...hugging the families of those
who have lost lives in war...

1643
01:34:53,055 --> 01:34:57,893
...and I view an armed Saddam as
a direct threat to the American people.

1644
01:34:57,935 --> 01:35:02,731
<i>Well, if there is a war, we'll work
together on the reconstruction.</i>

1645
01:35:02,815 --> 01:35:05,317
<i>We will all contribute.</i>

1646
01:35:07,402 --> 01:35:08,654
Okay, Jacques.

1647
01:35:08,779 --> 01:35:10,239
Then...

1648
01:35:11,073 --> 01:35:13,992
...that's it.
You have a good night now.

1649
01:35:14,076 --> 01:35:15,577
<i>Good night, George.</i>

1650
01:35:17,246 --> 01:35:20,332
I'd love to stuff some freedom fries
right down that frog's throat.

1651
01:35:20,374 --> 01:35:22,543
- Yeah.
- Thinks he can have it both ways.

1652
01:35:22,668 --> 01:35:23,794
Ripping off their oil...

1653
01:35:24,002 --> 01:35:27,005
...and then taking the high horse
and claiming the low road.

1654
01:35:27,131 --> 01:35:31,141
Sir, don't lose any sleep over
the French. He was never onboard.

1655
01:35:31,176 --> 01:35:34,763
<i>They got him on 60 Minutes next week
calling for 30 days for the inspectors.</i>

1656
01:35:34,847 --> 01:35:36,598
Thirty days?

1657
01:35:36,932 --> 01:35:40,185
Next chance that comes up,
remind me to veto something French...

1658
01:35:40,220 --> 01:35:42,146
...because I'd be damn glad to.

1659
01:35:42,271 --> 01:35:44,106
What about Putin?
Get him on the phone.

1660
01:35:44,439 --> 01:35:45,774
All right.

1661
01:35:46,024 --> 01:35:48,527
Might as well get stabbed
in the back all at once.

1662
01:35:48,610 --> 01:35:51,196
Like that guy in Rome.

1663
01:35:54,032 --> 01:35:57,536
<i>- teaspoonful
of dry anthrax in an envelope...</i>

1664
01:35:57,578 --> 01:36:00,622
<i>...shut down the United States Senate
in the fall of 2001.</i>

1665
01:36:00,706 --> 01:36:02,457
<i>This forced
several hundred people...</i>

1666
01:36:02,583 --> 01:36:04,877
<i>...to undergo
emergency medical treatment...</i>

1667
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:06,962
<i>...killed two postal workers...</i>

1668
01:36:07,045 --> 01:36:10,799
<i>...just from the amount
of just about this quantity.</i>

1669
01:36:11,633 --> 01:36:17,139
<i>Iraq declared 8500 liters of anthrax.</i>

1670
01:36:17,180 --> 01:36:21,143
My man, Balloon Foot,
came through in the end, didn't he?

1671
01:36:21,184 --> 01:36:27,441
<i>- even one teaspoonful
of this deadly material.</i>

1672
01:36:28,317 --> 01:36:30,736
You know, he's been a nudge
from the beginning...

1673
01:36:30,819 --> 01:36:33,322
...but this is gonna seal the deal.

1674
01:36:34,072 --> 01:36:36,575
It's the best speech he's ever given.

1675
01:36:39,995 --> 01:36:41,246
Can you believe that, Vice?

1676
01:36:41,496 --> 01:36:44,499
Comrade Pooty-Poot, with all
the problems he's got in Chechnya...

1677
01:36:44,583 --> 01:36:46,918
...he's got the balls
to feel bad for me.

1678
01:36:47,628 --> 01:36:50,005
It's all because
of that damn Kraut, Schrder.

1679
01:36:50,130 --> 01:36:52,090
Used me as a piata
to get re-elected.

1680
01:36:52,215 --> 01:36:54,301
I won't forget that.

1681
01:36:54,509 --> 01:36:57,638
Well, at least we got
Italy, Australia...

1682
01:36:57,763 --> 01:37:00,432
...the Czechs, Spain,
Poland, South Korea...

1683
01:37:00,474 --> 01:37:02,434
...and, you know, the Brits.

1684
01:37:02,643 --> 01:37:06,688
- Romania, Slovenia, Bulgaria.
- Yeah.

1685
01:37:06,730 --> 01:37:08,607
Japan is sending observers.

1686
01:37:08,690 --> 01:37:11,276
<i>And let's not forget
the 90 Mongolian troops.</i>

1687
01:37:11,401 --> 01:37:13,612
<i>I hear they're damn fine
wrestlers too.</i>

1688
01:37:14,613 --> 01:37:18,241
We got more than 40 countries
in this coalition, right?

1689
01:37:18,283 --> 01:37:21,828
Yeah, 49, sir, but most of them
do not have militaries.

1690
01:37:21,953 --> 01:37:23,705
Some are sending equipment.

1691
01:37:23,789 --> 01:37:26,833
- Morocco is sending monkeys.
- Monkeys?

1692
01:37:26,958 --> 01:37:30,796
Monkeys that are trained to locate
and set off minefields, yeah.

1693
01:37:30,837 --> 01:37:32,381
That's a good idea.

1694
01:37:32,798 --> 01:37:35,884
<i>- Okay, Tommy's standing by in Qatar.
- Right.</i>

1695
01:37:36,009 --> 01:37:38,804
Hey, Tommy.
How you doing over there?

1696
01:37:38,929 --> 01:37:41,223
<i>Hot as a goat's asshole, sir.</i>

1697
01:37:41,306 --> 01:37:42,808
What's the latest plan, Tom?

1698
01:37:42,891 --> 01:37:46,561
<i>Well, we should have 140,000
in the region any day now.</i>

1699
01:37:46,596 --> 01:37:48,647
<i>Seventy eight thousand of them
ground forces.</i>

1700
01:37:48,814 --> 01:37:50,816
<i>Another 50,000 are on the way.</i>

1701
01:37:50,899 --> 01:37:54,069
<i>We'll have a total force level
of 208,000 on the ground.</i>

1702
01:37:54,152 --> 01:37:56,154
That's great.
So you got all you need to go?

1703
01:37:56,321 --> 01:37:57,823
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

1704
01:37:57,906 --> 01:38:01,660
<i>Now, sir, we have identified
over 24 high-value targets.</i>

1705
01:38:01,701 --> 01:38:04,788
<i>But this could result
in civilian deaths.</i>

1706
01:38:04,913 --> 01:38:07,582
I'm no target picker, Tommy,
but I'm not Clinton either.

1707
01:38:07,707 --> 01:38:12,421
I don't wanna fire no $2 million missile
at a $10 empty tent, and hit a camel.

1708
01:38:12,456 --> 01:38:14,256
<i>Not gonna happen on my watch, sir.</i>

1709
01:38:14,381 --> 01:38:16,591
Be sure not to hit any schools
or hospitals.

1710
01:38:16,675 --> 01:38:20,345
<i>Well, I read you on the hospitals.
Any schools we'll hit at night.</i>

1711
01:38:20,429 --> 01:38:22,514
All right, what about
projected casualties?

1712
01:38:22,597 --> 01:38:26,351
<i>Well, I think now, more in
the neighborhood of several hundred.</i>

1713
01:38:26,393 --> 01:38:27,727
<i>No more than a thousand.</i>

1714
01:38:27,936 --> 01:38:31,606
Remember, Americans don't like to
see dead boys on their television sets.

1715
01:38:31,641 --> 01:38:34,526
<i>Yes, death tends to give war
a depressing image.</i>

1716
01:38:34,609 --> 01:38:38,446
<i>We can issue a blackout on
any coverage of soldiers in caskets.</i>

1717
01:38:38,488 --> 01:38:40,949
The same thing should apply
to military funerals.

1718
01:38:41,074 --> 01:38:43,368
Oh, yeah, that's good, Vice.

1719
01:38:43,702 --> 01:38:44,828
Well...

1720
01:38:45,036 --> 01:38:47,539
...it's been a long haul,
gentlemen, ladies.

1721
01:38:48,165 --> 01:38:49,624
I don't care what happens now...

1722
01:38:49,833 --> 01:38:52,878
...how many damn votes we do
or don't get in the U.N.

1723
01:38:54,129 --> 01:38:56,506
Come Monday morning, 10 a. m...

1724
01:38:56,715 --> 01:39:00,468
...I'm giving Saddam and his two sons
48 hours to get out of Dodge, okay?

1725
01:39:00,510 --> 01:39:02,137
<i>Indeed.</i>

1726
01:39:02,220 --> 01:39:03,805
All right.

1727
01:39:05,807 --> 01:39:07,142
Everybody in agreement then?

1728
01:39:07,225 --> 01:39:08,185
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

1729
01:39:08,393 --> 01:39:10,061
All right.

1730
01:39:10,395 --> 01:39:12,647
May God bless the troops.

1731
01:39:13,481 --> 01:39:15,817
May God bless America.

1732
01:39:52,812 --> 01:39:56,024
All right, way to go.
This is like the fall of the Berlin Wall.

1733
01:39:56,066 --> 01:39:57,400
I've got goose bumps.

1734
01:39:57,609 --> 01:40:00,737
Not one CBW attack. Not one Scud.
No surprises.

1735
01:40:00,862 --> 01:40:02,405
Except they're not surrendering.

1736
01:40:02,530 --> 01:40:05,116
Thousands are taking off
their uniforms and going home.

1737
01:40:05,200 --> 01:40:08,119
Well, good. I'll bet Saddam's running
from palace to palace...

1738
01:40:08,244 --> 01:40:09,788
...trying to find his passports.

1739
01:40:10,038 --> 01:40:12,123
Don't say I was wrong
on this one, Colin.

1740
01:40:12,207 --> 01:40:13,792
We did it, sir. Congratulations.

1741
01:40:13,875 --> 01:40:15,126
We sure did, Colin.

1742
01:40:15,335 --> 01:40:17,420
- Congratulations.
- Good to see you smiling.

1743
01:40:17,545 --> 01:40:19,631
What do you mean we, kemosabe?

1744
01:40:19,714 --> 01:40:20,757
Hey, good job.

1745
01:40:20,882 --> 01:40:23,385
- Hey.
- Good job, sir. Good job.

1746
01:40:23,468 --> 01:40:24,928
I remember you once agreeing...

1747
01:40:25,136 --> 01:40:27,847
...that going all the way to Baghdad
would be a mistake.

1748
01:40:27,889 --> 01:40:29,724
I think you made
a bigger boo-boo, Colin.

1749
01:40:29,933 --> 01:40:31,726
You could've been president.

1750
01:40:31,810 --> 01:40:33,478
Fuck you.

1751
01:40:38,483 --> 01:40:40,902
This is for those who doubted
I won the election.

1752
01:40:40,985 --> 01:40:42,862
- Yes, sir.
- And who doubted my judgment.

1753
01:40:42,987 --> 01:40:46,491
<i>So dropping a rope around its neck,
that didn't bring it down.</i>

1754
01:40:46,616 --> 01:40:50,245
<i>They took an ax to the base of
the statue, that didn't bring it down.</i>

1755
01:40:50,286 --> 01:40:53,081
<i>And this is finally what did.</i>

1756
01:40:53,164 --> 01:40:57,669
Yeah. We got the son of a bitch.
How about that?

1757
01:40:57,710 --> 01:41:00,088
Maybe he called it right after all.

1758
01:41:01,339 --> 01:41:03,591
Well, they got the statue...

1759
01:41:03,716 --> 01:41:06,344
...but now they gotta catch the man.

1760
01:41:13,184 --> 01:41:16,104
<i>Live from New York City,
this is SpinBall...</i>

1761
01:41:16,229 --> 01:41:19,441
<i>...with Jack Hawk and Candice Black.</i>

1762
01:41:23,111 --> 01:41:25,405
<i>What did you think of that?
That was spectacular.</i>

1763
01:41:25,530 --> 01:41:26,865
<i>Jack, it's really stunning.</i>

1764
01:41:26,948 --> 01:41:30,201
<i>I mean, he's landing on a boat
at 150 miles per hour.</i>

1765
01:41:30,243 --> 01:41:33,455
<i>I can't think of a Democrat
that would do that.</i>

1766
01:41:33,621 --> 01:41:35,290
<i>Exactly. Imagine Kerry.</i>

1767
01:41:35,415 --> 01:41:37,500
<i>Kerry would never be able
to pull this off.</i>

1768
01:41:37,625 --> 01:41:40,628
<i>This is the guy who threw down
someone else's Vietnam medals.</i>

1769
01:41:40,712 --> 01:41:43,715
<i>George Bush, on the other hand,
a man's man.</i>

1770
01:41:43,756 --> 01:41:47,802
<i>Women love that. We're buying
into that, and perception is reality.</i>

1771
01:41:47,927 --> 01:41:49,888
<i>George Bush looks for real, all right.</i>

1772
01:41:50,013 --> 01:41:53,391
<i>He didn't fight in the war,
but he looks like he did.</i>

1773
01:41:53,433 --> 01:41:56,811
<i>And women love President Bush
for this very reason.</i>

1774
01:41:56,895 --> 01:42:00,023
<i>And women love this war. It's simple.</i>

1775
01:42:00,148 --> 01:42:01,983
My fellow Americans...

1776
01:42:02,108 --> 01:42:05,737
...major combat operations in Iraq
has ended.

1777
01:42:05,778 --> 01:42:07,947
In the battle of Iraq...

1778
01:42:08,072 --> 01:42:12,535
...the United States and our allies
have prevailed.

1779
01:42:16,497 --> 01:42:19,500
In the images of celebrating Iraqis...

1780
01:42:19,751 --> 01:42:23,755
...we have seen the ageless appeal
of human freedom.

1781
01:42:23,796 --> 01:42:27,759
Everywhere that freedom steers,
let tyrants fear.

1782
01:42:28,176 --> 01:42:32,972
That is the Almighty's gift to every
man and woman in this world.

1783
01:42:34,098 --> 01:42:35,683
May God bless you all.

1784
01:42:36,100 --> 01:42:39,437
And may God continue
to bless America.

1785
01:42:50,782 --> 01:42:54,035
<i>Roadside bombs
killed six U.S. soldiers today...</i>

1786
01:42:54,118 --> 01:42:56,913
<i>...in separate attacks
in Fallujah and Baghdad.</i>

1787
01:42:56,955 --> 01:43:01,459
<i>To date, 853 American soldiers
have been killed in Iraq.</i>

1788
01:43:03,294 --> 01:43:06,130
<i>The bombing continues
a recent pattern of insurgency...</i>

1789
01:43:06,214 --> 01:43:10,593
<i>...directed at American troops,
but also the Iraqi civilian population...</i>

1790
01:43:10,628 --> 01:43:14,973
<i>...which is divided between Shiite
and Sunni religious affiliations.</i>

1791
01:43:15,932 --> 01:43:18,017
<i>The truck bomb killed at least 17...</i>

1792
01:43:18,142 --> 01:43:22,063
<i>...and wounded over 100
at the U.N. headquarters in Baghdad.</i>

1793
01:43:22,188 --> 01:43:25,650
<i>The blast also killed
U.N. Ambassador Sergio de Mello...</i>

1794
01:43:25,733 --> 01:43:27,902
<i>...who appears to have been
the main target.</i>

1795
01:43:28,027 --> 01:43:30,738
Back up. Back up.

1796
01:43:31,239 --> 01:43:32,907
<i>Former members of the Iraqi army...</i>

1797
01:43:33,157 --> 01:43:35,827
<i>...are protesting the dissolution
of the armed forces.</i>

1798
01:43:35,868 --> 01:43:38,579
<i>They have guns
but no food to feed their families.</i>

1799
01:43:38,663 --> 01:43:41,582
<i>Some have threatened
they will resort to suicide attacks...</i>

1800
01:43:41,666 --> 01:43:44,001
<i>...if their grievances
are not addressed.</i>

1801
01:43:48,256 --> 01:43:52,218
The Pentagon told me we'd be down
to 25 to 30,000 troops by August.

1802
01:43:52,343 --> 01:43:54,011
Is that anywhere near possible now?

1803
01:43:54,095 --> 01:43:58,349
Well, I'm afraid, Mr. President, we're
in for a longer haul than we thought.

1804
01:43:58,391 --> 01:44:00,977
Then where the hell
are the WMDs at?

1805
01:44:01,102 --> 01:44:05,356
Well, we control the country now, sir,
so I'm sure we're gonna find them.

1806
01:44:06,607 --> 01:44:07,775
All right, tell me this.

1807
01:44:07,859 --> 01:44:12,447
Whose job is it
to find these damn weapons?

1808
01:44:15,158 --> 01:44:18,911
Bremer, I mean, you're running
the whole show here, right?

1809
01:44:19,036 --> 01:44:21,289
- Well?
- That's not within my purview, sir.

1810
01:44:21,414 --> 01:44:24,125
I thought General Franks
was taking the initiative there.

1811
01:44:24,208 --> 01:44:26,419
Tom, you're commander
of the whole shebang...

1812
01:44:26,544 --> 01:44:29,922
That area was never part
of my command responsibility, sir.

1813
01:44:29,964 --> 01:44:33,926
- There was a team assigned by the...
- No, no. Who? Who's in charge?

1814
01:44:39,557 --> 01:44:43,644
Well, as per Secretary Rumsfeld's
wishes, sir...

1815
01:44:43,728 --> 01:44:46,731
...most normal postop
State Department functions, sir...

1816
01:44:46,772 --> 01:44:48,941
...were stripped from us
and given to Defense.

1817
01:44:49,066 --> 01:44:51,319
Why wasn't I told?

1818
01:44:51,861 --> 01:44:53,738
What's Rummy say about this?

1819
01:44:53,946 --> 01:44:58,659
Cambone... I believe that it's
Stephen Cambone's jurisdiction, sir.

1820
01:44:58,694 --> 01:45:01,162
Cam... What is that?
Cam who? Cam who?

1821
01:45:01,245 --> 01:45:05,082
Well, he's undersecretary of defense
for intelligence, Mr. President.

1822
01:45:05,124 --> 01:45:07,293
He reports to Secretary Rumsfeld.

1823
01:45:07,418 --> 01:45:08,669
Well, that's great.

1824
01:45:08,753 --> 01:45:10,421
I mean, that's just great.

1825
01:45:11,881 --> 01:45:16,260
Why the heck didn't anyone
tell me this before, huh?

1826
01:45:18,137 --> 01:45:21,182
Mr. President,
I wanna go back to Iraq.

1827
01:45:23,267 --> 01:45:25,902
Look, let me make this clear...

1828
01:45:25,937 --> 01:45:29,607
...since I've had some experience
dealing with these matters.

1829
01:45:31,776 --> 01:45:35,655
My son has got the toughest position
in the world.

1830
01:45:35,696 --> 01:45:39,533
He's the one
who gets the intelligence briefings.

1831
01:45:40,368 --> 01:45:42,119
And as Americans...

1832
01:45:42,328 --> 01:45:44,830
...it's our duty
to fully support his efforts...

1833
01:45:44,956 --> 01:45:48,376
...to bring freedom and democracy
to the Middle East.

1834
01:45:50,461 --> 01:45:52,546
And as a father...

1835
01:45:53,047 --> 01:45:55,258
...I'll be damned
if I'll listen to people...

1836
01:45:55,383 --> 01:45:58,177
...who are always trying
to tear the boy down.

1837
01:46:00,388 --> 01:46:03,057
And you know what?
They built him a set of metal legs...

1838
01:46:03,182 --> 01:46:05,142
...made him faster
than what he used to be.

1839
01:46:05,267 --> 01:46:07,061
They make them that good
these days.

1840
01:46:07,228 --> 01:46:10,982
You and I are gonna run together, son,
soon as you get back on your feet.

1841
01:46:11,107 --> 01:46:13,317
I give you my promise, all right?

1842
01:46:14,026 --> 01:46:15,569
Okay?

1843
01:46:34,755 --> 01:46:38,092
Got him a shirt. Maybe you can
give it to him when he wakes up.

1844
01:46:38,217 --> 01:46:39,885
I'd like...

1845
01:46:40,011 --> 01:46:41,554
...to stand up for you, sir.

1846
01:46:42,179 --> 01:46:43,514
No, you don't, sergeant.

1847
01:46:43,764 --> 01:46:46,225
No, I'm the one standing up for you.

1848
01:46:46,267 --> 01:46:48,853
Laura and I are looking forward
to seeing you next trip.

1849
01:46:48,936 --> 01:46:50,438
- All right, now?
- That's right.

1850
01:46:50,604 --> 01:46:52,606
All right, you hang in there.

1851
01:46:55,609 --> 01:46:57,403
Thank you.

1852
01:47:04,285 --> 01:47:05,327
Thank you.

1853
01:47:08,038 --> 01:47:10,207
David, good to see you.

1854
01:47:10,332 --> 01:47:13,043
- Mr. President.
- So, what do you got for us?

1855
01:47:16,046 --> 01:47:18,382
You used to love pecan pie,
Mr. President.

1856
01:47:18,466 --> 01:47:21,177
I've given up sweets
since the start of the war, Rummy.

1857
01:47:21,302 --> 01:47:24,513
My personal sacrifice
to show support for our troops.

1858
01:47:24,638 --> 01:47:29,101
The best pie I've ever tasted,
Mr. President.

1859
01:47:29,727 --> 01:47:34,398
So, what you're telling me, David,
comes down to nothing on nothing?

1860
01:47:34,440 --> 01:47:35,566
Frankly, we missed it...

1861
01:47:35,649 --> 01:47:38,402
...because Saddam pretended
that he had the weapons.

1862
01:47:39,236 --> 01:47:40,237
It doesn't make sense.

1863
01:47:40,362 --> 01:47:44,533
Why would he risk his life and
government by not coming clean?

1864
01:47:44,658 --> 01:47:46,911
Because I think...

1865
01:47:47,036 --> 01:47:50,080
...he didn't want his people to know
he didn't have the weapons.

1866
01:47:50,115 --> 01:47:52,666
Part of his Superman image.

1867
01:47:52,750 --> 01:47:55,586
Afraid they'd cut his throat
if they found out the truth.

1868
01:47:55,669 --> 01:47:58,422
You're saying this guy
was running a full house off a pair?

1869
01:47:58,506 --> 01:47:59,840
Come on, that's just nuts.

1870
01:47:59,965 --> 01:48:03,093
He really thought you were bluffing.
Right up to the end.

1871
01:48:03,177 --> 01:48:05,513
Me, bluff?

1872
01:48:05,596 --> 01:48:09,683
How could the CIA, all our
intel people, completely muff this?

1873
01:48:10,935 --> 01:48:13,312
I told Mr. Tenet from the beginning...

1874
01:48:13,437 --> 01:48:17,691
...that things weren't panning out
the way we thought they existed.

1875
01:48:18,025 --> 01:48:19,860
And your National Security advisers...

1876
01:48:19,985 --> 01:48:23,447
...should've got into this, gotten
the details and vetted them for you.

1877
01:48:23,531 --> 01:48:25,533
Believe me, Dr. Kay...

1878
01:48:25,616 --> 01:48:28,118
...when I say we were getting
thousands of reports...

1879
01:48:28,202 --> 01:48:30,287
...and not just from you or the CIA.

1880
01:48:30,412 --> 01:48:33,624
I don't see... I don't know that
putting the blame on some...

1881
01:48:33,749 --> 01:48:38,629
Mr. President, I think we're being
overly negative in a situation...

1882
01:48:38,671 --> 01:48:42,466
...where, indeed,
we lack the metrics...

1883
01:48:42,508 --> 01:48:46,053
...to judge the overall success
of the global war on terror.

1884
01:48:46,095 --> 01:48:50,724
My office sent to you
spy satellite photos...

1885
01:48:50,849 --> 01:48:55,145
...that showed that WMDs
could be hidden in caves...

1886
01:48:55,180 --> 01:48:57,648
...that you never responded to.

1887
01:48:57,731 --> 01:49:01,485
We analyzed those photos,
Mr. Vice President...

1888
01:49:01,568 --> 01:49:06,282
...and they are actually trenches,
watering holes for cattle.

1889
01:49:06,323 --> 01:49:08,075
Not caves.

1890
01:49:08,158 --> 01:49:10,244
That's not what my people told me.

1891
01:49:10,327 --> 01:49:11,912
Vice, you grew up in Wyoming.

1892
01:49:12,121 --> 01:49:14,415
You should damn well know cattle.

1893
01:49:15,165 --> 01:49:18,669
I mean, there you go.
You fool me once, shame on you.

1894
01:49:18,711 --> 01:49:20,879
Now, fool me twice...

1895
01:49:22,006 --> 01:49:23,924
...and you can't get fooled again.

1896
01:49:28,804 --> 01:49:30,889
I'm sorry, Mr. President.

1897
01:49:31,724 --> 01:49:34,518
We thought he had WMDs.

1898
01:49:35,269 --> 01:49:37,771
But we were all wrong about him.

1899
01:49:39,648 --> 01:49:41,608
And I include myself.

1900
01:49:47,781 --> 01:49:49,867
Our system...

1901
01:49:50,701 --> 01:49:52,786
...the integrity of it...

1902
01:49:53,287 --> 01:49:55,706
...has broken down completely.

1903
01:49:58,959 --> 01:50:03,005
And I have never traded access
for integrity.

1904
01:50:04,256 --> 01:50:07,384
And I am obligated to resign.

1905
01:50:33,327 --> 01:50:35,537
That was some shit sandwich
he served for lunch.

1906
01:50:35,829 --> 01:50:38,165
Working on it. We can
find someone who can deliver.

1907
01:50:38,248 --> 01:50:40,542
- I don't buy it. He had those weapons.
- No doubt.

1908
01:50:40,751 --> 01:50:42,085
But now we shift the ground.

1909
01:50:42,211 --> 01:50:44,087
Keep the focus
on freedom and democracy.

1910
01:50:44,171 --> 01:50:45,839
Rumsfeld is on another planet.

1911
01:50:45,964 --> 01:50:49,009
Sometimes I wonder.
I think he's lost it.

1912
01:50:49,092 --> 01:50:50,969
- What about Iran?
- Oh, yeah.

1913
01:50:51,094 --> 01:50:53,347
Bigtime uranium-enrichment
program going on.

1914
01:50:53,472 --> 01:50:55,849
- We're on it.
- Stay on it.

1915
01:50:55,974 --> 01:50:57,017
There's something there.

1916
01:50:57,226 --> 01:50:59,019
I can feel it.

1917
01:50:59,102 --> 01:51:02,231
<i>Kansas State and Ohio State,
a pair of top-10 teams squared off...</i>

1918
01:51:02,356 --> 01:51:05,150
<i>...in the Fiesta Bowl.
That was for the championship.</i>

1919
01:51:05,192 --> 01:51:08,904
<i>Krenzel, your MVP,
four touchdowns passing.</i>

1920
01:51:13,200 --> 01:51:15,035
Funny thing...

1921
01:51:16,411 --> 01:51:18,497
...Poppy once said.

1922
01:51:20,165 --> 01:51:22,376
I didn't appreciate it.

1923
01:51:23,627 --> 01:51:25,879
What was that, Geo?

1924
01:51:27,548 --> 01:51:29,466
Something about:

1925
01:51:30,467 --> 01:51:33,637
"Sometimes it's better to stay
out of the barrel. "

1926
01:51:43,313 --> 01:51:45,482
These lines here...

1927
01:51:46,567 --> 01:51:49,987
...seem like they just
dug in overnight.

1928
01:51:50,404 --> 01:51:52,698
You're as handsome as ever, Geo.

1929
01:51:52,823 --> 01:51:55,826
Only makes you look
more distinguished.

1930
01:51:58,412 --> 01:52:02,416
Your favorite play is coming to town.
Why don't we get tickets?

1931
01:52:07,004 --> 01:52:08,547
<i>Cats.</i>

1932
01:52:08,672 --> 01:52:11,341
The Broadway company
is going to be here.

1933
01:52:11,466 --> 01:52:13,427
You wanna go?

1934
01:52:14,094 --> 01:52:15,762
<i>Cats?</i>

1935
01:52:16,680 --> 01:52:18,974
That's something I'd stay up late for.
Definitely.

1936
01:52:19,099 --> 01:52:21,184
I thought so.

1937
01:52:25,022 --> 01:52:27,024
You know, I don't get it.

1938
01:52:28,025 --> 01:52:31,778
All this psychobabble in the media.

1939
01:52:32,195 --> 01:52:36,491
I mean, all I wanted to do
is make this a better and safer world...

1940
01:52:36,533 --> 01:52:38,368
...for everyone.

1941
01:52:39,286 --> 01:52:41,288
There's good and there's evil.

1942
01:52:41,371 --> 01:52:46,293
And you and I and the rest of the
people in America know the difference.

1943
01:52:47,544 --> 01:52:49,004
That good ultimately wins out.

1944
01:52:53,300 --> 01:52:57,471
But you have to fight for it.
You have to fight for it.

1945
01:52:57,506 --> 01:53:02,225
People have no idea
how hard it is on us.

1946
01:53:04,227 --> 01:53:07,064
The sacrifices you've made.

1947
01:53:07,355 --> 01:53:10,567
Laura, I knew when I married you
what you were made of.

1948
01:53:11,318 --> 01:53:14,738
That same bolt of lightning
hit both of us.

1949
01:53:14,780 --> 01:53:16,740
For better or worse.

1950
01:53:16,948 --> 01:53:19,159
Mostly better.

1951
01:53:23,830 --> 01:53:26,333
Since the start of the war, though...

1952
01:53:26,416 --> 01:53:30,087
...I barely have time
to run my three miles anymore.

1953
01:53:30,420 --> 01:53:31,546
My knees hurt.

1954
01:53:31,671 --> 01:53:34,174
I'm just off my pace.

1955
01:53:35,300 --> 01:53:37,511
It's been hard on me, Laura.

1956
01:53:37,594 --> 01:53:40,180
On top of everything else.

1957
01:53:40,305 --> 01:53:41,848
Well...

1958
01:53:42,599 --> 01:53:45,310
...someday the war will be over.

1959
01:53:45,602 --> 01:53:48,230
And we can have our lives back.

1960
01:53:51,149 --> 01:53:53,860
I'll get those tickets for next week.

1961
01:54:01,451 --> 01:54:04,371
- Poppy, what are you doing here?
- I used to sit in this chair.

1962
01:54:04,788 --> 01:54:06,873
Opposite Baker.

1963
01:54:08,667 --> 01:54:13,255
Got him to help pull your ass
out of the fire in Florida in 2000.

1964
01:54:14,506 --> 01:54:15,882
Don't forget that.

1965
01:54:17,300 --> 01:54:18,802
Come on. Let's go.

1966
01:54:18,885 --> 01:54:21,388
A little mano a mano.

1967
01:54:22,848 --> 01:54:25,642
- Bet you I can still whip your ass.
- What?

1968
01:54:26,184 --> 01:54:29,938
Got to admit, I scared you back then.
Still scare you, don't I?

1969
01:54:30,063 --> 01:54:33,900
I got a lot on my mind.
I don't need this, Poppy. Not now.

1970
01:54:38,405 --> 01:54:40,490
Why you being so ornery?

1971
01:54:40,574 --> 01:54:42,867
Because you disappoint me, Junior.

1972
01:54:42,993 --> 01:54:44,828
Deeply disappoint me.

1973
01:54:44,953 --> 01:54:47,747
After all these years. Still?

1974
01:54:47,872 --> 01:54:50,500
- You're still with that?
- No, no, no.

1975
01:54:50,584 --> 01:54:53,920
Not the girls or summer jobs anymore.

1976
01:54:56,423 --> 01:54:59,759
I dug myself out of the depths of hell
to stand on my own two feet...

1977
01:54:59,801 --> 01:55:02,470
...make something of myself.
And I did it on my own.

1978
01:55:02,679 --> 01:55:04,014
Think you did.

1979
01:55:04,264 --> 01:55:06,349
Yeah, well, you also wrecked it.

1980
01:55:06,433 --> 01:55:07,892
Wrecked. Wrecked what?

1981
01:55:08,018 --> 01:55:09,853
You've ruined it for us.

1982
01:55:09,978 --> 01:55:12,355
- What are you talking about?
- The Bush name.

1983
01:55:12,480 --> 01:55:13,523
Get out of my office.

1984
01:55:13,732 --> 01:55:16,359
Two hundred years of work. For Jeb.

1985
01:55:16,651 --> 01:55:18,320
Get out.

1986
01:55:18,528 --> 01:55:20,780
With this fiasco.

1987
01:55:20,822 --> 01:55:23,033
Get out of my life.

1988
01:55:23,199 --> 01:55:25,201
And that's what it is.

1989
01:55:25,285 --> 01:55:26,661
A goddamn fiasco.

1990
01:55:26,786 --> 01:55:28,038
Get out!

1991
01:55:28,455 --> 01:55:30,957
George. George.

1992
01:55:31,666 --> 01:55:33,043
Are you all right?

1993
01:55:33,209 --> 01:55:35,211
Oh, Jesus.

1994
01:55:35,295 --> 01:55:37,714
Jesus, George.

1995
01:55:42,218 --> 01:55:44,596
There's been tough weeks in Iraq.

1996
01:55:44,721 --> 01:55:46,681
But our central commitment
of the mission...

1997
01:55:46,806 --> 01:55:51,144
...is the transfer of sovereignty
back to the Iraqi people.

1998
01:55:52,228 --> 01:55:55,023
Now, we've set a deadline
for this to take place...

1999
01:55:55,148 --> 01:55:56,566
...three months from now.

2000
01:55:57,233 --> 01:56:00,653
June 30, 2004.

2001
01:56:07,327 --> 01:56:11,581
It's important that
we meet that deadline, all right?

2002
01:56:13,249 --> 01:56:15,460
The only way we can win...

2003
01:56:17,670 --> 01:56:21,424
...is to leave before the job is done.

2004
01:56:22,842 --> 01:56:24,427
Yeah.

2005
01:56:25,261 --> 01:56:26,513
I'll now take questions.

2006
01:56:26,721 --> 01:56:27,764
- Mr. President.
- Sir.

2007
01:56:27,847 --> 01:56:29,349
- Sir, sir.
- Question, sir.

2008
01:56:29,516 --> 01:56:31,017
Yeah.

2009
01:56:32,352 --> 01:56:33,686
Miss China?

2010
01:56:33,937 --> 01:56:36,439
Mr. President,
I know this is a tough question...

2011
01:56:36,523 --> 01:56:39,338
...but my viewers
would really like to know.

2012
01:56:39,373 --> 01:56:42,153
What place do you think
you'll have in history?

2013
01:56:42,570 --> 01:56:44,364
In history?

2014
01:56:45,490 --> 01:56:46,616
I don't know.

2015
01:56:47,033 --> 01:56:49,119
In history, we'll all be dead.

2016
01:56:49,661 --> 01:56:51,037
- Mr. President?
- Yeah.

2017
01:56:52,163 --> 01:56:54,791
- Mr. President?
- Yeah, John, there.

2018
01:56:54,874 --> 01:56:56,876
- Thank you, sir. Mr. President.
- Yeah.

2019
01:56:56,960 --> 01:57:01,548
<i>After 9/11, what would you say
your biggest mistakes would be...</i>

2020
01:57:01,631 --> 01:57:04,050
...and what lessons
have you learned from them?

2021
01:57:12,392 --> 01:57:14,143
Now, I wish you would have
given me...

2022
01:57:14,269 --> 01:57:16,354
...this written question beforehand,
John...

2023
01:57:18,439 --> 01:57:20,817
...so I could prepare for it.

2024
01:57:24,404 --> 01:57:26,489
You know, I just...

2025
01:57:31,077 --> 01:57:34,289
John, I'm sure historians will say,
"Gosh," you know.

2026
01:57:34,414 --> 01:57:38,167
"I wish he could've done better,
you know, this way or that way. "

2027
01:57:45,133 --> 01:57:48,219
Something will pop into my head
here in the press conference...

2028
01:57:48,261 --> 01:57:51,264
...with all the pressure of trying
to come up with an answer...

2029
01:57:51,389 --> 01:57:52,640
...but it hasn't yet.

2030
01:57:56,603 --> 01:57:58,354
You know, I hope...

2031
01:57:59,022 --> 01:58:02,233
I don't wanna sound like
I haven't made no mistakes.

2032
01:58:02,358 --> 01:58:04,527
You know, I'm confident I have.

2033
01:58:04,944 --> 01:58:06,946
It's just, I haven't...

2034
01:58:09,032 --> 01:58:11,284
You know, you really put me
on the spot here...

2035
01:58:11,409 --> 01:58:12,535
...and maybe I'm not...

2036
01:58:12,660 --> 01:58:16,539
...as quick on my feet
as I should be in coming up with one.

2037
01:58:39,228 --> 01:58:40,480
Mr. President.

2038
01:58:40,605 --> 01:58:43,524
Not now, Ari. Not now. I'm busy.

2039
01:58:52,992 --> 01:58:56,746
<i>We're locked into a dandy, 1-1 here,
bottom of the eighth, two outs...</i>

2040
01:58:56,871 --> 01:58:58,247
<i>...as Spencer stands in.</i>

2041
01:58:58,414 --> 01:59:00,208
<i>He's 3-for-3 on the night.</i>

2042
01:59:00,416 --> 01:59:03,002
<i>This is the first time he's come up
with a man on base.</i>

2043
01:59:03,252 --> 01:59:04,921
<i>He hasn't had a chance
to do damage.</i>

2044
01:59:05,004 --> 01:59:07,173
<i>He'd certainly love to do some here.</i>

2045
01:59:07,298 --> 01:59:10,343
<i>Monroe off of first. That was
the starting pitcher by the way.</i>

2046
01:59:10,426 --> 01:59:12,595
<i>Jay Fletcher you just saw down
in the bullpen.</i>

2047
01:59:12,720 --> 01:59:13,971
<i>Woodhouse is on deck.</i>

2048
01:59:14,097 --> 01:59:16,182
<i>Schwartz will follow if we get that far.</i>

2049
01:59:16,265 --> 01:59:18,559
<i>Chavez now from the stretch.</i>

2050
01:59:18,684 --> 01:59:20,228
<i>And the pitch to Monroe.</i>

2051
01:59:20,436 --> 01:59:23,022
<i>Swinging, there's a fly ball
into right field.</i>

2052
01:59:23,147 --> 01:59:24,524
<i>Moving over.</i>

2053
01:59:24,607 --> 01:59:26,067
<i>He dives, he misses the ball.</i>

2054
01:59:26,192 --> 01:59:28,444
<i>Monroe rounds first.
He heads for second.</i>

2055
01:59:28,569 --> 01:59:31,197
<i>And here comes Spencer
around third going for home.</i>

2056
01:59:31,364 --> 01:59:32,949
<i>The relay to the plate is...</i>

2057
01:59:33,157 --> 01:59:36,285
<i>...not in time.
And Texas takes the lead, 2 to 1.</i>

2058
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:40,119
