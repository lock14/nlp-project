00:02:07,015 --> 00:02:10,015
<i>This has been America News
Radio from Washington.</i>

2
00:02:10,175 --> 00:02:13,655
<i>Now back to your local
ANR station for news on the hour.</i>

3
00:02:14,615 --> 00:02:20,535
<i>Good evening. You're listening
to 108.9 FM, KMZR, Portland. This...</i>

4
00:02:36,575 --> 00:02:37,695
Evening, ma'am.

5
00:03:36,175 --> 00:03:37,815
You, too.

6
00:03:46,815 --> 00:03:48,255
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

7
00:03:48,415 --> 00:03:50,775
- Careful. Careful, it's hot.
- Thank you.

8
00:03:50,935 --> 00:03:54,095
- Busy night for the bad guys?
- Even busier night for us.

9
00:04:00,415 --> 00:04:02,535
Okay.

10
00:04:02,815 --> 00:04:04,855
Let's see what you got for me.

11
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:12,255
Oh, hey,
because you're dying to know...

12
00:04:12,415 --> 00:04:16,375
...I'm almost positive my first date last
night is eligible for the hall of fame.

13
00:04:18,655 --> 00:04:21,375
She was amazing.
She looked exactly like her photo.

14
00:04:21,615 --> 00:04:22,975
You'll never see her again.

15
00:04:23,135 --> 00:04:26,135
- How do you know?
- Because you look nothing like yours.

16
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:29,015
Nice one.

17
00:04:45,175 --> 00:04:48,215
- Here's that guy I was telling you about.
- Oh, yeah?

18
00:04:48,415 --> 00:04:51,335
He changes his name every day.
It's taken me a week to isolate him.

19
00:04:51,495 --> 00:04:53,055
Listen to this.

20
00:04:54,175 --> 00:04:56,855
- Tunethief. Com.
- Oh, how original.

21
00:04:57,495 --> 00:04:59,575
Yeah, he offers free downloads
of pirated music.

22
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,855
I'm running this
in a fake virtual machine.

23
00:05:02,015 --> 00:05:04,215
Watch what happens
when I accept his offer.

24
00:05:05,335 --> 00:05:07,735
Now, he's stealing my financial data...

25
00:05:08,015 --> 00:05:09,775
...and all my passwords.

26
00:05:10,455 --> 00:05:13,215
Which I happened to have gathered
in a file called "passwords. "

27
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:15,095
Nice touch.

28
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:18,655
I threw in a backdoor Trojan so
we can see what he's doing with it.

29
00:05:18,815 --> 00:05:21,855
He's run up a quarter-million dollars
in fraud the past three weeks.

30
00:05:22,015 --> 00:05:25,175
- Well, what's he into?
- High-end tech and low-end porn.

31
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:29,455
God. You sure it's a guy? If it's
a woman, she could be my soul mate.

32
00:05:29,615 --> 00:05:30,975
Send it over to me.

33
00:05:32,255 --> 00:05:33,975
There you go.

34
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,535
My dummy Capital One card.
Hope he goes for it.

35
00:05:36,735 --> 00:05:37,815
Okay, I see it.

36
00:05:40,175 --> 00:05:42,855
I'm surprised he has
the patience for auctions.

37
00:05:43,615 --> 00:05:46,975
- Oh, you've got him now.
- Okay, there's his IP address.

38
00:05:47,455 --> 00:05:48,975
Let's get his physical one.

39
00:05:49,135 --> 00:05:52,215
Portland Police sent this over.
They weren't sure what to do with it.

40
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:53,815
Thank you.

41
00:05:54,975 --> 00:05:57,335
- It is a woman.
- ER nurse, lives alone.

42
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:00,855
No priors,
no history of online purchases.

43
00:06:01,015 --> 00:06:02,655
It's not her. Gotta be a neighbor...

44
00:06:02,815 --> 00:06:06,335
...somebody close by, someone
who could access her wireless router.

45
00:06:06,495 --> 00:06:09,375
Sharon Dobbs lives here.

46
00:06:09,735 --> 00:06:12,535
All right. Here we go,
here's somebody.

47
00:06:14,095 --> 00:06:17,695
Sam Barrows. He's a computer
programmer for the school district.

48
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:19,695
He's lived there six weeks.
He's a renter.

49
00:06:19,855 --> 00:06:22,735
He's registered for three handguns
and two assault rifles.

50
00:06:22,895 --> 00:06:23,895
That's your guy.

51
00:06:24,055 --> 00:06:26,855
Jennifer Marsh, FBI Cyber Crimes
up in Portland.

52
00:06:27,015 --> 00:06:29,175
We need you to knock down
a door for us.

53
00:06:45,695 --> 00:06:48,215
Oh, I gotta get reassigned.

54
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,175
What's the matter?

55
00:06:50,335 --> 00:06:52,575
It's just a sickness. It's just too much.

56
00:06:52,735 --> 00:06:54,775
I got this
retired high school principal...

57
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:57,135
...offering to come over
to where I'm babysitting.

58
00:06:57,295 --> 00:06:59,815
He's got so many chats,
he can't keep his names straight.

59
00:06:59,975 --> 00:07:02,095
He keeps calling me Jill
instead of Molly.

60
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:05,175
I'm only interested in what his
cellmates are gonna call him.

61
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:07,095
I'm taking a break. Do you want?

62
00:07:07,255 --> 00:07:09,615
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

63
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:29,655
All right.

64
00:07:44,055 --> 00:07:47,575
I see feet! Get your hands up!
Get your hands up!

65
00:07:47,735 --> 00:07:50,295
On your stomach! On your stomach!

66
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:08,695
<i>On flawless, cut Natalie K diamonds.</i>

67
00:08:08,895 --> 00:08:12,855
<i>Huge savings on one-karat diamonds.
Presented by the LaRog Brothers.</i>

68
00:08:16,695 --> 00:08:19,455
- What the hell is this?
- I don't know. I'm running it down now.

69
00:08:19,615 --> 00:08:20,855
It is streaming live.

70
00:08:21,055 --> 00:08:23,415
Just when you thought
you've seen it all.

71
00:08:23,775 --> 00:08:26,175
Oh, look, a message from our sponsor.

72
00:08:26,335 --> 00:08:29,215
"Ha-ha. Only serious. "

73
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:33,375
Jennifer Marsh, Cyber Crimes.

74
00:08:33,775 --> 00:08:36,975
Carter Thompson here.
I'm at the Barrow residence.

75
00:08:37,415 --> 00:08:40,335
The suspect's in custody.
Hard drive's intact.

76
00:08:40,495 --> 00:08:44,375
<i>- Plenty of contraband.
- Good work. Hey, let me guess.</i>

77
00:08:44,535 --> 00:08:47,655
It's not just Barrow. His son's
involved. He's got a son?

78
00:08:47,815 --> 00:08:49,215
<i>What makes you say that?</i>

79
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:51,695
Well, high-tech toys and porn...

80
00:08:51,895 --> 00:08:54,495
...and then out of the blue,
he buys a gold wristwatch.

81
00:08:54,655 --> 00:08:56,535
How come? And then it hit me.

82
00:08:56,695 --> 00:09:01,055
01-10-57.
Sunday's his father's birthday.

83
00:09:02,295 --> 00:09:04,055
Sweet dreams, Marsh.

84
00:09:09,855 --> 00:09:10,815
<i>Good morning.</i>

85
00:09:10,975 --> 00:09:14,335

87
00:09:16,335 --> 00:09:19,855

88
00:09:20,015 --> 00:09:24,055
<i>And on the Web at mzrnews. Org.
First, the weather.</i>

89
00:09:24,215 --> 00:09:27,535
<i>The hurricane system that has poured
3 inches of rain on western Portland...</i>

90
00:09:27,735 --> 00:09:30,495
<i>...in the past 24 hours
has finally let up.</i>

91

92

<i>OnStar operator Tina. Good morning,
Ms. Marsh. How can I assist you?</i>

93
00:09:39,895 --> 00:09:41,695
Yes, Tina.

94
00:09:42,095 --> 00:09:45,415
I'd like to get home
sometime before Easter.

95
00:09:45,575 --> 00:09:47,335
I'm in a traffic jam here.

96
00:09:47,495 --> 00:09:49,455
<i>Okay, let's see.</i>

97
00:09:49,615 --> 00:09:52,415
<i>You're in the middle

98
00:09:52,575 --> 00:09:56,255

99

<i>- Okay, I see it now. Thank you.
- You're welcome.</i>

100
00:10:04,175 --> 00:10:06,775
Come on, keep it moving.

101
00:10:38,655 --> 00:10:41,615
- Shit, you scared me.
- Watch your mouth, young lady.

102
00:10:42,095 --> 00:10:46,015
Hey, that's what I said to you
when you were a kid.

103
00:10:46,175 --> 00:10:49,255
I know, Mom. That's what
makes it so darn funny.

104
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:51,095
Oh, somebody's crabby.

105
00:10:51,255 --> 00:10:54,015
Sorry. Long night.

106
00:11:08,895 --> 00:11:10,735
Mom!

107
00:11:10,895 --> 00:11:13,455
- Look at the outfit I'm making.
- I can see that.

108
00:11:13,615 --> 00:11:16,335
- You're stealing my job.
- You were late.

109
00:11:16,495 --> 00:11:19,695
I know. I'm sorry about that, sweetie.

110
00:11:20,575 --> 00:11:21,775
Catch any bad guys?

111
00:11:23,095 --> 00:11:25,735
One. Just one.

112
00:11:31,055 --> 00:11:32,175
Okay, I'm coming.

113
00:11:32,335 --> 00:11:36,295
Slowpoke. The slowest poke
I've ever seen, ever.

114
00:11:37,055 --> 00:11:38,855
I'm coming.

115
00:11:41,495 --> 00:11:43,895
- How are things with you and Maddy?
- Better.

116
00:11:44,095 --> 00:11:46,575
Mrs. Tischler's gonna
give us a second chance.

117
00:11:46,735 --> 00:11:50,015
- A second chance at what?
- Being friends.

118
00:11:50,175 --> 00:11:52,855
Oh, of course. I think that's great.

119
00:11:53,175 --> 00:11:56,375
She can come to my party now.
Make sure to send her mom an Evite.

120
00:11:56,535 --> 00:11:58,415
- You got it.
- Maybe Grandma should do it.

121
00:11:58,575 --> 00:11:59,735
- I'll do it.
- Are you sure?

122
00:11:59,895 --> 00:12:02,895
When I say I'll do it, I'll do it,
okay? I promise.

123
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,135
- I love you.
- I love you, too, babe.

124
00:12:13,055 --> 00:12:16,375
I bet you'd like me
to do this some other time!

125
00:12:42,015 --> 00:12:43,935
Hey, friendly.

126
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:36,855
All right, Jennifer. Let's see
this tortured kitty of yours.

127
00:13:37,015 --> 00:13:38,855
Torture's over, sir.

128
00:13:39,495 --> 00:13:42,815
- Yeah, I should say so.
- Poor Lulu.

129
00:13:42,975 --> 00:13:44,375
That was the cat's name.

130
00:13:45,055 --> 00:13:47,815
The owner, Scotty Hillman,
26, from West Linn...

131
00:13:47,975 --> 00:13:51,895
...says she was snatched a few days
ago from his lawn during a yard sale.

132
00:13:52,095 --> 00:13:53,935
He recognized her fancy collar.

133
00:13:54,095 --> 00:13:55,615
West Linn. So this site...

134
00:13:55,775 --> 00:13:58,575
...which could have originated
anywhere from Oslo to Istanbul...

135
00:13:58,735 --> 00:14:00,255
Is local. Yes, sir.

136
00:14:00,415 --> 00:14:01,975
The odds of that are pretty steep.

137
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:05,255
About a million to one, if it were
a coincidence, which it's not.

138
00:14:05,415 --> 00:14:08,415
The only way we found out about this
is because it was tipped...

139
00:14:08,575 --> 00:14:12,455
...to the county sheriff's office and the
police within minutes of it going up.

140
00:14:12,615 --> 00:14:15,455
Both tips came from a pay phone
in the central city...

141
00:14:15,615 --> 00:14:19,095
...so whoever is behind the site
is local and wants attention.

142
00:14:19,255 --> 00:14:21,135
- Shut him down.
- I just did.

143
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:26,615
- There you go.
- I'll type the address in again.

144
00:14:33,695 --> 00:14:35,255
It's been doing that all night.

145
00:14:35,415 --> 00:14:39,175
The site's IP changes constantly. Each
new address is an exploited server...

146
00:14:39,335 --> 00:14:41,135
...that's running a mirror of the site.

147
00:14:41,535 --> 00:14:44,055
The site's Russian name server
uses a low TTL...

148
00:14:44,255 --> 00:14:47,135
...so your computer constantly queries
the name server's record.

149
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:49,535
That's how it gives
you a new address consistently.

150
00:14:49,695 --> 00:14:52,295
There are thousands of exploited
servers on the Internet...

151
00:14:52,455 --> 00:14:54,455
...so he won't run out of victims soon.

152
00:14:54,615 --> 00:14:56,495
He's accessing these machines
so quickly...

153
00:14:56,655 --> 00:14:58,775
...he's got to be
running his own botnet.

154
00:14:58,975 --> 00:15:00,375
We are blackholing these IPs...

155
00:15:00,575 --> 00:15:03,535
...but every time we shut one down,
a new mirror pops up.

156
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:05,975
I don't understand a single word
you just said.

157
00:15:06,175 --> 00:15:07,855
What does Russia
have to do with this?

158
00:15:08,015 --> 00:15:11,055
The domain registrar
and name servers are all in Russia.

159
00:15:11,215 --> 00:15:13,135
We have no jurisdiction there.

160
00:15:13,735 --> 00:15:15,535
Jennifer...

161
00:15:15,695 --> 00:15:17,375
...it's a cat.
- Yeah.

162
00:15:17,535 --> 00:15:20,775
Considering the state of the world,
aren't there more important things...

163
00:15:20,935 --> 00:15:24,255
...to be concerned about, like
something under our jurisdiction?

164
00:15:26,735 --> 00:15:28,775
Back to work, gentlemen.

165
00:15:38,775 --> 00:15:42,215
<i>Things are about to get warmer when
one of the hottest hockey rivalries...</i>

166
00:16:16,095 --> 00:16:19,095
Are you the guy? You got the
extra ticket for the hockey game?

167
00:16:40,015 --> 00:16:43,775
Grandma! Grandma! Grandma!

168
00:16:43,935 --> 00:16:45,415
- Did you get it?
- Yes, I did!

169
00:16:45,575 --> 00:16:47,535
Oh, my God, I'm so proud of you!

170
00:16:47,695 --> 00:16:50,495
And the boy I fought was so tall too.

171
00:16:50,655 --> 00:16:53,775
- Careful, I'm all wet.
- So am I.

172
00:16:53,935 --> 00:16:57,015
We celebrated. We had an ice cream.

173
00:16:57,495 --> 00:16:59,055
Hello.

174
00:17:35,615 --> 00:17:36,615
Mom?

175
00:17:36,775 --> 00:17:38,975
- Honey... Mom, please!
- Okay, okay.

176
00:17:39,135 --> 00:17:41,335
Come on, baby.
Let's get you out of these clothes.

177
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:49,335
I've been monitoring the site all week.
Nothing but a still of the dead kitten.

178
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:52,375
Last night around 11, the site
went down, I'd hoped forever.

179
00:17:52,575 --> 00:17:56,895
Anyway, a few minutes ago, this.

180
00:17:58,615 --> 00:18:01,055
It's the same basement
still streaming live.

181
00:18:01,215 --> 00:18:05,095
The top is the number of active viewers
and some chemical-dosage flow.

182
00:18:05,255 --> 00:18:07,855
He's carved the name of the website
into the guy's chest.

183
00:18:08,015 --> 00:18:09,535
He's threatening to drain him.

184
00:18:09,695 --> 00:18:12,655
Threatening to drain what, his blood?
How's he gonna do that?

185
00:18:12,815 --> 00:18:15,415
Those letters aren't any deeper
than paper cuts.

186
00:18:15,575 --> 00:18:16,975
Not the cuts, it's the bleeding.

187
00:18:17,135 --> 00:18:20,015
We think that box regulates
the fluid going into the victim.

188
00:18:20,175 --> 00:18:22,895
Those cables are probably
connected to our guy's computer.

189
00:18:23,055 --> 00:18:25,655
Look, his nose is starting
to bleed and he's bruising.

190
00:18:25,815 --> 00:18:28,215
We think those bags have
some anticoagulant in them.

191
00:18:28,415 --> 00:18:31,455
I've got a list of them right here.
The most common is heparin.

192
00:18:31,615 --> 00:18:35,615
If you get the dose right, you save a
life. Wrong, you've got a hemophiliac.

193
00:18:36,535 --> 00:18:39,735
So the more people who visit the site,
the more the drug is released...

194
00:18:39,935 --> 00:18:41,175
...and the faster he bleeds.

195
00:18:41,335 --> 00:18:43,735
- That's what we believe.
- Well, isn't that wonderful?

196
00:18:43,935 --> 00:18:47,295
Well, if that counter is accurate,
the public would seem to agree.

197
00:18:47,455 --> 00:18:49,335
They're tuning in at an alarming rate.

198
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:51,695
The victim's name
is Herbert Miller, 54.

199
00:18:51,855 --> 00:18:55,095
Lives in Sellwood, works
for Burnside Executive Charter.

200
00:18:55,255 --> 00:18:59,015
Friday night, got back from a shuttle
to Mount Hood, called his wife...

201
00:18:59,175 --> 00:19:02,295
...says that he gets an e-mail
from a friend of a friend...

202
00:19:02,495 --> 00:19:05,215
...offering center-ice seats
to the Winter Hawks game.

203
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:07,335
He promises
he'll be home afterwards.

204
00:19:07,495 --> 00:19:09,295
- He wasn't.
- Any priors?

205
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:12,815
- Who, Miller?
- Why is that relevant?

206
00:19:13,015 --> 00:19:15,615
Remember that snuff film
sent to the L.A. Office last year?

207
00:19:15,775 --> 00:19:18,535
Teenage geisha cut in two.
Looked as real as anything you saw.

208
00:19:18,695 --> 00:19:22,415
Six weeks later, they found her alive
and well, waiting tables in Little Tokyo.

209
00:19:22,575 --> 00:19:25,335
Maybe Miller's involved somehow.
Maybe there's a connection.

210
00:19:36,895 --> 00:19:39,575
What are you doing to me?

211
00:20:04,095 --> 00:20:05,175
Mrs. Miller!

212
00:20:09,215 --> 00:20:10,815
Just go away. Just leave.

213
00:20:10,975 --> 00:20:13,735
- Okay, folks, one side, please.
- I don't know.

214
00:20:13,895 --> 00:20:16,535
Come on. Police.
Coming through. Mrs. Miller.

215
00:20:17,055 --> 00:20:18,975
Back off. Back off. Mrs. Miller.

216
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:21,655
- Portland Police. May we come in?
- Thank God you're here.

217
00:20:21,855 --> 00:20:23,895
I need you to back off right now.

218
00:20:25,575 --> 00:20:29,255
My name is Detective Box.
This is my partner, Detective Moy.

219
00:20:29,415 --> 00:20:33,215
Listen, is there someplace
else we can talk?

220
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:35,415
Yeah, let's go outside.

221
00:20:42,495 --> 00:20:45,175
Oh, shit. Fuck!

222
00:20:46,335 --> 00:20:49,135
<i>So, Mrs. Miller, when was the
last time you saw your husband?</i>

223
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:51,415
Yesterday morning.

224
00:20:51,615 --> 00:20:56,815
He called, and he said he'd got tickets
to the Winter Hawks game last night.

225
00:20:57,015 --> 00:21:00,735
He likes hockey, and I just wanted
him to come straight home.

226
00:21:00,895 --> 00:21:02,935
Okay. Listen...

227
00:21:03,135 --> 00:21:06,535
...I understand what you're going
through is very difficult. All right?

228
00:21:06,695 --> 00:21:10,375
But you're making it worse by talking
to the press. Don't talk to the press.

229
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:11,735
Do you understand? Listen.

230
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:15,415
Don't talk to the press
and stay off the computer. Okay?

231
00:21:36,535 --> 00:21:39,455
Listen to this. I'm running the logs
from that mirror we took down.

232
00:21:39,615 --> 00:21:43,695
He's blocking all the foreign IPs. Only
Americans can gain access to the site.

233
00:21:43,855 --> 00:21:45,775
How patriotic.

234
00:21:46,335 --> 00:21:49,415
We've scanned every newsgroup,
chat room, blog, website and forum...

235
00:21:49,575 --> 00:21:53,015
...referencing "Kill With Me,"
and I think we found our first post.

236
00:21:53,215 --> 00:21:56,695
It appeared just before the site went
up, then it was spammed Web-wide.

237
00:21:56,855 --> 00:21:59,295
"A cat caught in a rattrap.
How's that for irony?

238
00:21:59,455 --> 00:22:02,415
It's streaming live on killwithme. Com.
It's awesome. Check it out. "

239
00:22:02,575 --> 00:22:05,295
It was posted by a sophomore
named Andrew Kilburn.

240
00:22:05,455 --> 00:22:09,335
It came from his account, but it didn't
actually originate from his computer.

241
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:12,295
So our guy hacked his account
and used it to start the thread.

242
00:22:12,455 --> 00:22:14,575
- Yeah.
- Let's go after the originating IP.

243
00:22:18,335 --> 00:22:20,255
Oh, God.

244
00:22:20,415 --> 00:22:22,215
It's too bad this guy wasn't
a Boy Scout.

245
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:24,815
He could just blink Morse code
and tell us where he is.

246
00:22:38,095 --> 00:22:42,095
Okay, I've got the "who is. "
It comes back Blue Sky ISP.

247
00:22:42,255 --> 00:22:46,095
- Username and password, please.
- Coming to you now.

248
00:22:49,055 --> 00:22:51,615
- "Chang's Restaurant"?
- He hacked into their site?

249
00:22:51,775 --> 00:22:54,455
No. No. Half the office eats there.

250
00:22:54,655 --> 00:22:57,495
He's messing with us.
He wanted us to find this.

251
00:22:57,655 --> 00:22:59,695
Who the hell is this guy?

252
00:23:06,375 --> 00:23:08,775
Jennifer Marsh, Detective Eric Box.

253
00:23:08,935 --> 00:23:11,055
Portland Police has him
on the Miller abduction.

254
00:23:11,215 --> 00:23:14,455
- Jennifer's our case agent on this.
- Case agent, sir?

255
00:23:14,615 --> 00:23:16,375
- You caught it, you got it.
- Please.

256
00:23:16,575 --> 00:23:19,375
Sir, anyone else. You know I'm
on nights because of my daughter.

257
00:23:19,535 --> 00:23:21,375
I understand that, but you're it.

258
00:23:22,655 --> 00:23:24,375
- We forming a task force?
- Not yet.

259
00:23:24,575 --> 00:23:26,295
Not yet?
How much more do you need?

260
00:23:26,495 --> 00:23:29,975
So far we have one dead cat and a man
who may or may not be in danger...

261
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:33,335
That's today. You think this is it?
It's just the beginning.

262
00:23:33,855 --> 00:23:35,295
Marsh, hold it.

263
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:38,095
You share what you've got,
and then you take it from there.

264
00:23:38,255 --> 00:23:40,815
Appreciate your coming in, detective.

265
00:23:43,695 --> 00:23:45,855
All right. You first.

266
00:23:46,255 --> 00:23:49,055
Well, we found Miller's car
in the Rose Garden parking lot.

267
00:23:49,215 --> 00:23:51,055
No prints but his own.

268
00:23:51,215 --> 00:23:54,015
We passed out photos of the
basement to some local contractors.

269
00:23:54,175 --> 00:23:57,495
They say, judging from the timbers,
the house was built in the '20s or '30s.

270
00:23:57,695 --> 00:24:00,695
Which narrows it down to,
you know, half the city.

271
00:24:03,735 --> 00:24:04,695
Yeah, what else?

272
00:24:04,895 --> 00:24:07,495
Miller appears to be a decent guy.
He's a Vietnam vet...

273
00:24:07,655 --> 00:24:10,535
...coaches his daughter's soccer,
they go to church every Sunday.

274
00:24:10,695 --> 00:24:12,735
So why'd the subject pick him?

275
00:24:13,575 --> 00:24:15,095
"Subject"?

276
00:24:15,975 --> 00:24:17,375
Are we in science class?

277
00:24:18,095 --> 00:24:20,695
- What would you prefer?
- How about "piece of shit"?

278
00:24:22,215 --> 00:24:23,655
Why Miller?

279
00:24:24,255 --> 00:24:26,455
I don't know. Maybe it was random.

280
00:24:26,615 --> 00:24:28,375
What about the kitten?
Talk to that guy?

281
00:24:28,535 --> 00:24:30,655
Scotty Hillman, yeah.
He's a fucking jackass.

282
00:24:30,815 --> 00:24:33,135
All he cares about is getting
the kitten's collar...

283
00:24:33,295 --> 00:24:36,095
...because he paid 12 bucks
for it on bidityours. Com

284
00:24:36,255 --> 00:24:38,975
Which I suppose is a lot of money
if you're flipping burgers.

285
00:24:39,135 --> 00:24:42,455
What I would like to know is,
why him? Why his kitten?

286
00:24:42,655 --> 00:24:45,855
Why take the risk of stealing when
you can get one free at any shelter?

287
00:24:46,335 --> 00:24:48,975
- What do you guys got?
- It's a website.

288
00:24:49,135 --> 00:24:52,095
It's like nothing we've ever seen.
It's extremely sophisticated.

289
00:24:52,255 --> 00:24:55,255
As long as its source-streaming site
is a ghost, it's untraceable.

290
00:24:56,135 --> 00:24:59,095
This guy can invite the world to help
him kill Miller or anybody...

291
00:24:59,255 --> 00:25:01,975
...and there's not a goddamn thing
we can do about it.

292
00:25:06,415 --> 00:25:07,935
Excuse me.

293
00:25:16,975 --> 00:25:20,175
- It's over.
- Yeah.

294
00:25:20,735 --> 00:25:24,375
The numbers, they just... exploded.

295
00:25:30,495 --> 00:25:33,055
"Rolling on the floor laughing.

296
00:25:33,215 --> 00:25:34,335
Thank you for... "

297
00:25:35,175 --> 00:25:37,535
"For all your support.

298
00:25:37,695 --> 00:25:38,895
More to come. "

299
00:25:41,055 --> 00:25:43,095
Well, we'll see about that.

300
00:25:46,935 --> 00:25:49,055
It's a jungle in there.

301
00:26:17,055 --> 00:26:21,095
<i>Hey, I just went to the site
after the guy was dead...</i>

302
00:26:21,255 --> 00:26:24,575
<i>I got a list of assholes my girlfriends
and me think he ought to kill next.</i>

303
00:26:24,735 --> 00:26:30,615
<i>Last seen five days ago, FBI agents
have been working around the clock...</i>

304
00:26:39,975 --> 00:26:41,575
There's a pickup truck.

305
00:26:41,735 --> 00:26:43,615
What's that on the back, a gun rack?

306
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:47,615
Yeah, well, there's no way that freak is
stepping foot in my dad's country club.

307
00:26:47,775 --> 00:26:49,535
So call Tucker.

308
00:27:03,215 --> 00:27:05,935
<i>At 7: 15 a. m., a vehicle at the home...</i>

309
00:27:06,095 --> 00:27:08,695
<i>...of Oregon congressman
Joseph A. Restom.</i>

310
00:27:08,895 --> 00:27:11,735
<i>Herbert Miller had been the focus
of an intense local...</i>

311
00:27:11,895 --> 00:27:13,775
<i>...and statewide police
and FBI search...</i>

312
00:27:13,975 --> 00:27:16,215
<i>...since midday Saturday
when he showed up...</i>

313
00:27:16,415 --> 00:27:20,015
...on an Internet website
being tortured and murdered live.

314
00:27:20,175 --> 00:27:23,695
Now, because of the uniqueness
of the crime, and because the FBI...

315
00:27:23,855 --> 00:27:27,535
...is able to provide resources
critical to this investigation...

316
00:27:28,135 --> 00:27:32,095
...they will be leading the interagency
task force assigned to the case.

317
00:27:33,055 --> 00:27:37,015
He flew helicopters for a living. What's
his connection to a U.S. Congressman?

318
00:27:37,175 --> 00:27:40,735
Our guy had to dump the body.
Why not on a national stage?

319
00:27:40,895 --> 00:27:44,055
You think he did it to get a press
conference? Build up his fan base?

320
00:27:44,255 --> 00:27:46,135
Don't call them fans.
They're accomplices.

321
00:27:46,335 --> 00:27:49,095
All right, whatever.
Why'd he choose Restom?

322
00:27:49,255 --> 00:27:50,535
He's owned by Silicon Valley.

323
00:27:50,695 --> 00:27:53,535
He sits on the House Judiciary
Committee on Net neutrality.

324
00:27:53,695 --> 00:27:56,375
No restriction on content,
all traffic treated equally.

325
00:27:56,575 --> 00:27:59,255
- Wouldn't our guy be for that?
- You'd think so.

326
00:27:59,415 --> 00:28:01,295
Miller's clients
were corporate executives.

327
00:28:01,455 --> 00:28:02,855
Maybe some were from high-tech.

328
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:04,935
I'll track down a customer list.

329
00:28:05,095 --> 00:28:07,935
- What about the neighbors?
- One saw a van drive by at 4 a. m.

330
00:28:08,095 --> 00:28:10,095
Another heard a car door slam
a minute later.

331
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:12,175
Figured it was the paper
being delivered.

332
00:28:12,335 --> 00:28:14,375
Excuse me a second.
Might have something here.

333
00:28:14,535 --> 00:28:16,855
- What is it?
- Tip just came in through a hot line.

334
00:28:17,015 --> 00:28:21,215
Guy named Arthur James Elmer, an
engineer at Chadwick Technologies.

335
00:28:21,375 --> 00:28:23,415
He was fired six months ago...

336
00:28:23,615 --> 00:28:25,975
...for installing a wireless Webcam
in the men's room.

337
00:28:26,135 --> 00:28:29,335
Nice. Anyway, he's been talking
about killwithme. com nonstop...

338
00:28:29,495 --> 00:28:31,655
...ever since the kitty died.
Wanna ride with us?

339
00:28:31,815 --> 00:28:33,655
Let me check this guy out
on my end.

340
00:28:33,815 --> 00:28:35,855
- We'll catch up later.
- Yeah.

341
00:29:03,455 --> 00:29:06,655
- So, what's going on?
- He won't let us in. Kind of shy.

342
00:29:13,895 --> 00:29:15,375
Elmer.

343
00:29:17,815 --> 00:29:21,135
Look, if you didn't do anything,
you got nothing to lose letting us in.

344
00:29:22,095 --> 00:29:25,455
And if you did, we can always
come back with a warrant.

345
00:29:28,135 --> 00:29:30,175
So how do you wanna play it?

346
00:29:38,135 --> 00:29:39,575
Hi.

347
00:29:40,535 --> 00:29:42,055
I'm Detective Box.

348
00:29:42,215 --> 00:29:44,375
Unusual name.

349
00:29:45,695 --> 00:29:47,735
Well, it wasn't up to me.

350
00:29:49,975 --> 00:29:53,415
So you really think I killed that guy?

351
00:29:54,975 --> 00:29:56,775
I don't know. Did you?

352
00:29:57,735 --> 00:29:59,015
Well, I'm flattered.

353
00:29:59,175 --> 00:30:02,215
I found it highly entertaining,
especially at the end.

354
00:30:02,375 --> 00:30:04,375
The way viewership
increased exponentially...

355
00:30:04,535 --> 00:30:07,575
...like some sort of epidemic.

356
00:30:08,535 --> 00:30:10,295
Can I see the basement?

357
00:30:50,975 --> 00:30:52,655
You like movies, huh?

358
00:30:53,535 --> 00:30:54,975
Yeah, who doesn't?

359
00:30:56,255 --> 00:30:57,655
Me.

360
00:31:00,095 --> 00:31:01,775
Burn your own copies?

361
00:31:01,935 --> 00:31:03,375
You know that's illegal, right?

362
00:31:14,295 --> 00:31:16,415
Can't say they didn't warn you.

363
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:33,535
Got our proof it wasn't Elmer.

364
00:31:34,335 --> 00:31:35,935
Starting Friday at 1 p. M...

365
00:31:36,255 --> 00:31:40,135
...Elmer was logged into a chat
room for 12 consecutive hours.

366
00:31:40,295 --> 00:31:44,015
At the time Miller disappeared,
Elmer was in a steamy private chat...

367
00:31:44,175 --> 00:31:47,815
...with the first tenor of the
Men's Chorus of Greater Tacoma.

368
00:31:47,975 --> 00:31:50,015
It still felt good arresting him.

369
00:32:11,695 --> 00:32:13,535
<i>- Hello?
- I caught you.</i>

370
00:32:14,175 --> 00:32:17,895
<i>- Barely. I've got a big date tonight.
- Big, special or big, large?</i>

371
00:32:18,055 --> 00:32:21,895
I don't know. I haven't met Peggy
the secretary yet. What's up?

372
00:32:22,055 --> 00:32:25,735
<i>I had a thought. Remember that
Andrew Kilburn guy and his review?</i>

373
00:32:25,895 --> 00:32:27,575
Yeah, sure. What about it?

374
00:32:27,855 --> 00:32:30,255
Well, why use his account?

375
00:32:30,455 --> 00:32:34,015
I mean, maybe it wasn't random.
Maybe they know each other.

376
00:32:34,495 --> 00:32:36,615
<i>- Yeah, it's possible.
- Yeah.</i>

377
00:32:36,775 --> 00:32:39,775
<i>- All right. I'll see you Sunday.
- Wait, Sunday?</i>

378
00:32:41,095 --> 00:32:42,175
Annie's birthday.

379
00:32:42,815 --> 00:32:45,735
Oh, shit, I forgot.

380
00:32:45,895 --> 00:32:48,175
<i>- Okay, can I bring a date?
- Are you kidding?</i>

381
00:32:48,415 --> 00:32:50,375
You don't even know
if you like this girl.

382
00:32:50,535 --> 00:32:53,855
No, not Peggy. Melanie.
She's a social worker.

383
00:32:54,015 --> 00:32:56,495
She likes sushi and rock-climbing
and Dickens.

384
00:32:56,655 --> 00:33:00,135
<i>- I can't believe you.
- It's a numbers game.</i>

385
00:33:00,295 --> 00:33:02,815
<i>Fine, fine. I gotta go.</i>

386
00:33:02,975 --> 00:33:05,295
Okay. Hey, you got a date?

387
00:33:05,455 --> 00:33:09,295
<i>- Good night.
- Okay. Bye. Good night, Sam.</i>

388
00:33:22,775 --> 00:33:24,535
Molly gave me
a birthday present already.

389
00:33:24,735 --> 00:33:26,535
It's a computer game
that I downloaded.

390
00:33:26,695 --> 00:33:29,615
- It's about horses.
- How sweet of her. That looks like fun.

391
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:32,495
Not really. It's kind of silly.

392
00:33:33,455 --> 00:33:37,615
- I'll show it to you later.
- Okay, honey. I love you. Gotta run.

393
00:34:07,615 --> 00:34:10,455
Come on, Annie. Let me get one first.

394
00:34:12,575 --> 00:34:14,175
Somebody order a bunch of pizzas?

395
00:34:14,335 --> 00:34:15,655
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

396
00:34:15,815 --> 00:34:17,815
- Hey, Griffin.
- For the birthday girl. Hello.

397
00:34:17,975 --> 00:34:20,695
- How are you? Over here?
- Over here.

398
00:34:23,295 --> 00:34:26,415
Listen, I only made it through
a few months of Kilburn's posts.

399
00:34:26,575 --> 00:34:28,295
- We'll need more bodies on this.
- Okay.

400
00:34:28,455 --> 00:34:33,015
He blogged, he uploaded vids, he
built sites. He practically lived online.

401
00:34:33,215 --> 00:34:36,055
- What, not anymore?
- Not since he died...

402
00:34:36,255 --> 00:34:39,455
...of something called
diabetic ketoacidosis.

403
00:34:39,615 --> 00:34:42,815
Which is what happens when you
don't take your insulin for a few days.

404
00:34:42,975 --> 00:34:45,775
Anyway, an hour after his body
was found...

405
00:34:45,935 --> 00:34:47,055
...Kill With Me went up.

406
00:34:47,215 --> 00:34:50,055
And an hour after that, Kilburn's
review was spammed Web-wide.

407
00:34:50,215 --> 00:34:53,935
- And you think our guy killed him?
- The ME called it a suicide.

408
00:35:18,295 --> 00:35:19,455
Hi.

409
00:35:19,615 --> 00:35:21,215
You're right on time.

410
00:35:21,375 --> 00:35:24,855
Yeah, well, it's a curse.
I spend half my life waiting for people.

411
00:35:25,015 --> 00:35:28,015
So... Dave Williams.

412
00:35:30,655 --> 00:35:34,935
That's a great address, by the way.
Eights bring prosperity.

413
00:35:35,095 --> 00:35:37,855
- I didn't know that.
- Yeah.

414
00:35:38,655 --> 00:35:40,695
- Come in.
- Thanks.

415
00:35:55,935 --> 00:35:56,935
Here you go, honey.

416
00:35:57,095 --> 00:35:59,055
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

417
00:36:03,615 --> 00:36:04,695
Detective.

418
00:36:04,895 --> 00:36:06,935
- Hi.
- Hi.

419
00:36:07,095 --> 00:36:10,295
Griffin invited me
to his birthday party.

420
00:36:11,775 --> 00:36:13,855
Yeah. Kind of a young crowd.

421
00:36:14,015 --> 00:36:16,015
Kind of a young crowd, Griffin.

422
00:36:16,175 --> 00:36:18,895
- Well, do you skate?
- No.

423
00:36:19,055 --> 00:36:20,975
- Thank you.
- Yeah, go ahead.

424
00:36:21,175 --> 00:36:23,895
Look, I'm gonna get out of here.
I'm sorry.

425
00:36:24,055 --> 00:36:27,735
You just got here. Don't go.
Have some pizza.

426
00:36:27,895 --> 00:36:30,735
Come on. It's not that bad.

427
00:36:40,015 --> 00:36:43,055
Wow, you must really like Asia, huh?

428
00:36:44,975 --> 00:36:46,735
Just Korea.

429
00:36:49,015 --> 00:36:50,655
Korea.

430
00:36:51,135 --> 00:36:53,015
Well, it's fabulous.

431
00:36:54,175 --> 00:36:55,695
Thank you.

432
00:36:58,375 --> 00:37:00,215
So you gonna let me see them?

433
00:37:00,775 --> 00:37:02,415
Of course.

434
00:37:03,295 --> 00:37:04,735
Through the kitchen.

435
00:37:07,775 --> 00:37:11,815
I gotta tell you, a 710 Pullman
and a 712 Observation Car?

436
00:37:11,975 --> 00:37:14,015
My heart skipped a beat
when I got your e-mail.

437
00:37:14,175 --> 00:37:18,175
- Lf they're really in mint condition...
- My dad and I hardly ever used them.

438
00:37:18,695 --> 00:37:22,735
We mostly played foosball
and we built things.

439
00:37:24,095 --> 00:37:26,975
Toys, contraptions.

440
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:29,455
We had a workshop.

441
00:37:30,095 --> 00:37:31,935
He died last year.

442
00:37:34,575 --> 00:37:37,455
Well, I'm sorry.

443
00:37:50,975 --> 00:37:52,495
Annie, would you come over here
for a second? Bring your skates.

444
00:37:52,535 --> 00:37:54,055
Annie, would you come over here
for a second? Bring your skates.

445
00:37:54,215 --> 00:37:57,175
- Okay.
- I want you to meet someone.

446
00:37:59,535 --> 00:38:02,455
This is Annie, the birthday girl.
This is my friend, Eric.

447
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:04,375
- Hello, Annie.
- Hi.

448
00:38:04,535 --> 00:38:06,295
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks.

449
00:38:06,735 --> 00:38:08,535
You must be, what, 8?

450
00:38:09,055 --> 00:38:11,415
How did you know?
Everyone else thinks I'm older.

451
00:38:12,695 --> 00:38:14,095
Well, I'm a detective.

452
00:38:15,935 --> 00:38:18,255
- Are you ready to go skating finally?
- I think.

453
00:38:34,175 --> 00:38:36,135
I sure hope you like it.

454
00:38:36,295 --> 00:38:37,855
It's a punching bag.

455
00:38:38,015 --> 00:38:39,215
Okay, so you blow it up...

456
00:38:39,375 --> 00:38:41,495
...and whenever you
get in a really bad mood...

457
00:38:41,695 --> 00:38:43,175
...you sock it in the head.

458
00:38:44,455 --> 00:38:45,455
Can I do karate on it?

459
00:38:45,615 --> 00:38:49,615
Of course you can. You can do karate,
kung fu, tae kwon do.

460
00:38:49,775 --> 00:38:52,655
- Thank you, Griffin.
- You're welcome, sweetie.

461
00:38:52,855 --> 00:38:54,135
That might be my date.

462
00:38:56,255 --> 00:38:57,735
Mom.

463
00:38:59,775 --> 00:39:01,695
Oh, come on.

464
00:39:02,295 --> 00:39:03,455
Happy birthday, sweetie.

465
00:39:03,615 --> 00:39:04,735
- Have fun.
- Thanks.

466
00:39:06,695 --> 00:39:08,535
Sweetheart...

467
00:39:09,015 --> 00:39:09,935
...I gotta go.

468
00:39:10,175 --> 00:39:12,855
It's a real emergency, or I
would never leave you like this.

469
00:39:13,055 --> 00:39:15,895
- I'll make it up to you, I promise. Okay?
- Okay.

470
00:39:18,495 --> 00:39:20,415
I'm looking for Griffin Dowd. He's...

471
00:39:20,575 --> 00:39:21,535
- Yeah. Hi.
- Hi.

472
00:39:21,695 --> 00:39:23,415
- I'm Melanie.
- Oh, yes. Hi, Melanie.

473
00:39:23,615 --> 00:39:26,615
Wow, you are gorgeous.
I'm sorry. I've gotta run.

474
00:39:56,255 --> 00:39:57,775
Todd!

475
00:39:58,495 --> 00:40:00,495
Isn't that your dad?

476
00:40:08,535 --> 00:40:11,575
- Same build, same coloring.
- The counter's faster than last time.

477
00:40:12,255 --> 00:40:13,775
Yeah.

478
00:40:14,775 --> 00:40:16,655
I swear I've seen this guy
somewhere before.

479
00:40:16,855 --> 00:40:18,775
- Yeah.
- We all have. He's David Williams.

480
00:40:18,975 --> 00:40:20,895
He used to be
a reporter for Channel 12.

481
00:40:21,175 --> 00:40:23,255
He now hosts a TV show
on public access.

482
00:40:23,455 --> 00:40:25,215
Call Bagley.
Set up a press conference.

483
00:40:25,375 --> 00:40:27,895
Sir, wait just a minute, please.

484
00:40:28,255 --> 00:40:31,055
This is what he wants. Anything
you say will promote the site.

485
00:40:31,215 --> 00:40:33,335
That's a possibility,
but what would you prefer?

486
00:40:33,535 --> 00:40:35,055
Talk to National Security Agency.

487
00:40:35,215 --> 00:40:37,895
Their computer capability's
beyond ours. We need their help.

488
00:40:38,055 --> 00:40:40,535
That's fine, but I've got
a man being publicly tortured.

489
00:40:40,735 --> 00:40:44,015
How will it look if he dies and the
Bureau never tried to help the guy?

490
00:40:44,175 --> 00:40:47,775
Not as bad as if we reach out
and it kills him faster.

491
00:40:48,775 --> 00:40:51,295
You honestly believe
that could happen?

492
00:40:53,135 --> 00:40:54,655
Yes, sir, I do.

493
00:41:02,815 --> 00:41:04,055
I'm sorry, Marsh.

494
00:41:05,775 --> 00:41:07,415
I got no choice.

495
00:41:33,975 --> 00:41:36,135
<i>We're gathered here
to share some information...</i>

496
00:41:36,295 --> 00:41:37,935
<i>...in regards to criminal conduct...</i>

497
00:41:38,095 --> 00:41:40,735
<i>...that originated in the
Portland metropolitan area...</i>

498
00:41:40,895 --> 00:41:43,895
<i>...but that has
far-reaching implications.</i>

499
00:41:44,055 --> 00:41:45,935
<i>Let me introduce
Special Agent-in-Charge...</i>

500
00:41:46,095 --> 00:41:48,375
<i>...of the FBI's Portland field office...</i>

501
00:41:48,575 --> 00:41:50,455
...Richard Brooks.

502
00:41:51,775 --> 00:41:53,255
Thank you, chief.

503
00:41:54,255 --> 00:41:57,775
<i>A week ago, a man was killed
in this city.</i>

504
00:41:58,655 --> 00:42:03,215
<i>This barbaric, cowardly murder
was streamed live on the Internet.</i>

505
00:42:03,375 --> 00:42:07,095
<i>As part of the killer's design, the more
people who logged on to the site...</i>

506
00:42:07,295 --> 00:42:11,535
<i>...to witness the victim's suffering,
the sooner the victim died.</i>

507
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:13,815
<i>Millions of Americans
chose to visit the site...</i>

508
00:42:14,015 --> 00:42:18,495
<i>...believing that they were witnessing
a mere hoax, a stunt or a prank.</i>

509
00:42:18,655 --> 00:42:20,175
<i>Well, unfortunately, it wasn't.</i>

510
00:42:20,375 --> 00:42:21,935
<i>Today a second individual...</i>

511
00:42:22,095 --> 00:42:24,855
<i>...has appeared on the site
and his life, too, is in jeopardy.</i>

512
00:42:25,055 --> 00:42:28,335
<i>The victim is the doting father
of two boys...</i>

513
00:42:30,135 --> 00:42:32,375
<i>...a loving husband of 22 years...</i>

514
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:35,855
<i>...and a devoted son. In other words,
he's a good American, one of us.</i>

515
00:42:36,055 --> 00:42:40,015
<i>The torture that he is experiencing
now is unimaginable in its cruelty.</i>

516
00:42:40,735 --> 00:42:41,975
<i>We're doing what we can...</i>

517
00:42:42,175 --> 00:42:45,175
<i>...to shut down the site
and bring the killer to justice.</i>

518
00:42:45,415 --> 00:42:48,215
<i>In the meantime, we ask that
everyone stay away from the site.</i>

519
00:42:48,855 --> 00:42:50,855
Any visit to this site,
no matter how brief...

520
00:42:51,015 --> 00:42:52,975
...will only hasten the victim's death.

521
00:42:54,975 --> 00:42:58,335
Any American who visits the site
is an accomplice to murder.

522
00:42:58,495 --> 00:43:00,855
<i>We are the murder weapon.</i>

523
00:43:01,015 --> 00:43:04,615
<i>- We ask that you spread the word...
- Let's main-screen the website.</i>

524
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:08,695
Hey, Tim, I think
he's trying to say something.

525
00:43:12,775 --> 00:43:14,935
Eight... Eight...

526
00:43:17,455 --> 00:43:19,775
Eight, eight, eight.

527
00:43:20,335 --> 00:43:22,335
Oh, I get it. It's an address, I think.

528
00:43:22,935 --> 00:43:26,775
Eight... Eight-oh-eight...

529
00:43:26,975 --> 00:43:28,535
...Newberry.
- Newberry?

530
00:43:28,735 --> 00:43:30,615
There's a Newberry Road
in Laurelhurst.

531
00:43:55,135 --> 00:43:56,135
Police! Open the door!

532
00:44:16,415 --> 00:44:18,135
Basement's here!

533
00:44:31,175 --> 00:44:32,175
It's the wrong house.

534
00:44:40,015 --> 00:44:42,575
<i>- Any American who visits the site...
- He was here, though.</i>

535
00:44:42,735 --> 00:44:45,815
<i>...is an accomplice to murder.
We are the murder weapon.</i>

536
00:44:46,015 --> 00:44:49,815
<i>Any American who visits the site
is an accomplice to murder.</i>

537
00:44:50,015 --> 00:44:52,695
<i>We are the murder weapon.
Any American...</i>

538
00:44:52,855 --> 00:44:56,015
All right. We should send
Forensics in here.

539
00:44:57,655 --> 00:45:01,215
<i>Any American who visits the site
is an accomplice to murder.</i>

540
00:45:01,375 --> 00:45:04,095
<i>We are the murder weapon.</i>

541
00:45:09,375 --> 00:45:14,175
Yeah, I understand that. Just
have her check it again, okay?

542
00:45:14,335 --> 00:45:17,455
- Six hours. So fast.
- Twice as fast as Miller.

543
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:20,055
Nobody thinks
they did anything wrong.

544
00:45:20,735 --> 00:45:25,015
Why should they?
They're curious about a website.

545
00:45:25,495 --> 00:45:27,855
You check the headlines,
check the stock market...

546
00:45:28,055 --> 00:45:29,975
...watch some strangers have sex.

547
00:45:30,455 --> 00:45:32,895
See a journalist get his head cut off.

548
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:38,255
When did the world
go so fucking insane?

549
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:43,255
You've been working
the streets too long.

550
00:45:43,935 --> 00:45:47,895
He was definitely here.
He just got moved and didn't know it.

551
00:45:51,895 --> 00:45:54,455
So Mrs. Williams is checking her
husband's e-mail for us.

552
00:45:56,655 --> 00:46:00,095
She says he was contacted about the
trains through the public TV website.

553
00:46:01,335 --> 00:46:04,975
I guess in his bio, he mentions he's
a collector. That was about a week ago.

554
00:46:05,455 --> 00:46:06,535
Who owns the house?

555
00:46:06,695 --> 00:46:12,295
Tom Park, 60s, widower. He's out
of town visiting family in South Korea.

556
00:46:12,455 --> 00:46:15,495
He runs a local market here.
He makes the trip every year.

557
00:46:16,055 --> 00:46:18,255
So our guy's a customer.

558
00:46:18,575 --> 00:46:21,455
We're trying to get ahold of Mr. Park,
see if he knows anything.

559
00:46:21,615 --> 00:46:24,615
We'll do a canvass. Seems like
a pretty tight-knit community.

560
00:46:24,775 --> 00:46:26,295
Maybe somebody saw something.

561
00:47:38,735 --> 00:47:40,295
Did you see this?

562
00:47:43,255 --> 00:47:45,495
On the bright side, along with
every other daily...

563
00:47:45,655 --> 00:47:47,655
...they're not printing
the name of the site.

564
00:47:47,815 --> 00:47:49,655
Well, isn't that noble?

565
00:47:49,855 --> 00:47:50,975
A little late, though.

566
00:47:52,815 --> 00:47:55,895
Did Annie ever forgive you
for bailing on the party?

567
00:47:56,255 --> 00:47:59,935
Yeah. After 11 bedtime stories.
Thank you.

568
00:48:01,175 --> 00:48:04,775
You know, when we first met,
I knew you looked familiar.

569
00:48:07,575 --> 00:48:09,455
Nick and I came up together.

570
00:48:12,255 --> 00:48:14,775
Nick Haskins.
That was Annie's father, right?

571
00:48:15,775 --> 00:48:17,535
Did he introduce us?

572
00:48:18,655 --> 00:48:22,135
No. No, we never met.
I saw you at the funeral.

573
00:48:24,215 --> 00:48:25,775
Right.

574
00:48:30,895 --> 00:48:34,615
Anyway, he was a...
He was a great guy.

575
00:48:35,455 --> 00:48:37,975
Yeah, he was a great guy.

576
00:48:47,295 --> 00:48:50,335
<i>It's apparent our subject
is extremely organized...</i>

577
00:48:50,495 --> 00:48:52,175
...and sophisticated.

578
00:48:52,335 --> 00:48:54,895
And based upon his ability
to subdue his victims...

579
00:48:55,055 --> 00:48:57,695
...transport them and maintain
physical control over them...

580
00:48:57,855 --> 00:49:01,455
...in a private setting, I'd describe
the offender as highly capable.

581
00:49:01,615 --> 00:49:03,495
Remember, he's not going
after easy prey.

582
00:49:03,655 --> 00:49:05,975
These abductions leave him exposed.

583
00:49:06,175 --> 00:49:09,335
Even the kitten he stole
in broad daylight. Why the risks?

584
00:49:09,495 --> 00:49:14,055
Because each of these actions was
absolutely essential to his purpose.

585
00:49:14,215 --> 00:49:16,655
You wanna catch him,
understand his goals.

586
00:49:16,855 --> 00:49:18,735
You know, this guy...

587
00:49:18,935 --> 00:49:21,295
...he's the same as
the Unabomber, Tim McVeigh.

588
00:49:21,495 --> 00:49:23,655
He's another terrorist
trying to make a statement.

589
00:49:23,815 --> 00:49:27,535
Maybe. Still, it goes back to his goals.
Why kill these particular people?

590
00:49:27,855 --> 00:49:30,175
And why is he killing them
on the Internet?

591
00:49:30,335 --> 00:49:33,775
My guess, none of it's random.
None of it.

592
00:49:39,015 --> 00:49:44,215
Okay. Every post Kilburn ever left.
Thousands. And a couple of DVDs.

593
00:49:44,415 --> 00:49:48,575
One for you, one for me. Every
video clip that he ever uploaded.

594
00:49:48,735 --> 00:49:52,055
That was his real hobby, was
pulling the sick shit off the Net...

595
00:49:52,255 --> 00:49:55,375
...and then posting it
on shock-video sites.

596
00:49:56,135 --> 00:49:59,415
Anyways, this is the last post
before he died.

597
00:49:59,775 --> 00:50:01,695
It's sort of a best-of compilation...

598
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:04,295
...something he called
"The Best of the Worst. "

599
00:50:10,335 --> 00:50:11,415
Oh, yeah.

600
00:50:13,815 --> 00:50:16,535
Poor Kilburn. He had so much
to offer the world.

601
00:50:16,695 --> 00:50:17,855
Yeah.

602
00:50:18,215 --> 00:50:21,855
I got four more bodies from Brooks,
so let's share the pain, shall we?

603
00:50:22,015 --> 00:50:23,415
Great.

604
00:51:16,815 --> 00:51:18,575
Okay.

605
00:52:08,295 --> 00:52:11,895
Mom. TiVo's not working.

606
00:52:12,055 --> 00:52:15,055
Okay, honey.
Look, I'll be out in a minute.

607
00:52:43,655 --> 00:52:46,575
Mom, there's a video of our house
on the computer.

608
00:52:46,775 --> 00:52:49,935
Watch whatever you want, honey.
I'll be right out.

609
00:53:25,135 --> 00:53:27,415
Hey, Griff. Good morning.

610
00:53:41,735 --> 00:53:42,735
Annie.

611
00:53:51,935 --> 00:53:53,495
Annie!

612
00:53:55,295 --> 00:53:57,015
- Annie!
- Mom?

613
00:54:01,175 --> 00:54:04,175
Baby, what are you doing out here?
What are you doing outside?

614
00:54:04,335 --> 00:54:06,615
I was just gonna ride my bike
for the camera.

615
00:54:06,775 --> 00:54:08,775
You stay with Grandma.

616
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:22,615
Hey. Hey, that's evidence.

617
00:54:22,815 --> 00:54:25,615
- I'm sorry. My daughter, she...
- It's okay. We're here now.

618
00:54:25,775 --> 00:54:28,535
It's okay.
Do you know whose car this is?

619
00:54:28,695 --> 00:54:31,255
Yeah, I think I have an idea
whose car this is.

620
00:54:36,935 --> 00:54:38,455
God.

621
00:55:14,695 --> 00:55:17,455
Annie thought she'd downloaded
a game from one of her friends.

622
00:55:17,615 --> 00:55:18,855
It had a backdoor Trojan.

623
00:55:19,015 --> 00:55:21,935
It got him all the way
into my wireless network.

624
00:55:22,495 --> 00:55:24,575
Which means that he has access
to all my files.

625
00:55:48,535 --> 00:55:51,335
Call me when you get there.
I love you.

626
00:56:02,775 --> 00:56:04,775
Why don't you just go with them?

627
00:56:06,015 --> 00:56:07,735
What are you waiting for?

628
00:56:09,815 --> 00:56:11,695
And do what? Hide out?

629
00:56:12,655 --> 00:56:14,175
That's right.

630
00:56:14,735 --> 00:56:17,615
I think you've sacrificed enough
already, don't you?

631
00:56:19,615 --> 00:56:21,535
Nobody's gonna blame you
for taking cover.

632
00:56:21,695 --> 00:56:24,095
The piece of shit's camped out
on your front lawn.

633
00:56:24,455 --> 00:56:27,015
Annie's already lost one parent
to the job, so...

634
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:30,935
...yeah. Get lost.

635
00:56:34,455 --> 00:56:36,215
Just my opinion.

636
00:57:03,095 --> 00:57:06,295
<i>- Yeah?
- Hey, Jen. Did they get off okay?</i>

637
00:57:06,455 --> 00:57:10,135
<i>Yeah. The Bureau's gonna put
them up a couple hours away.</i>

638
00:57:10,295 --> 00:57:12,775
<i>And I'm gonna stay someplace
closer to work.</i>

639
00:57:12,935 --> 00:57:16,815
Good. So you wanna hear my theory
why he did this?

640
00:57:17,015 --> 00:57:18,015
Of course.

641
00:57:18,175 --> 00:57:20,855
<i>There is a connection
between him and Kilburn...</i>

642
00:57:21,015 --> 00:57:24,535
<i>...and he knows you're leading
the team to find it.</i>

643
00:57:24,815 --> 00:57:26,815
I think I might know what
that connection is.

644
00:57:26,975 --> 00:57:29,295
Emphasis on "might. "
A few things I gotta check out.

645
00:57:29,455 --> 00:57:30,935
I'm on my way in. Are you coming?

646
00:57:31,895 --> 00:57:33,175
I need a couple hours.

647
00:57:33,455 --> 00:57:34,735
<i>I'll see you at the office.</i>

648
00:57:34,895 --> 00:57:36,455
Okay, I'll show you
what I got then.

649
00:57:36,615 --> 00:57:37,975
Okay.

650
00:57:41,695 --> 00:57:44,535
<i>- Griffin Dowd.
- Hi. It's Melanie.</i>

651
00:57:46,335 --> 00:57:49,975
Melanie, hi. I didn't think
I'd hear from you again.

652
00:57:50,255 --> 00:57:53,015
<i>Your e-mail was very sweet.</i>

653
00:57:53,175 --> 00:57:55,855
Thank you. Yeah, I spent
a lot of time on that one.

654
00:57:57,735 --> 00:58:00,735
So I heard you hung out
at the roller rink.

655
00:58:00,895 --> 00:58:02,855
Even had some cake?

656
00:58:03,255 --> 00:58:06,255
<i>Two pieces. But don't tell anybody.</i>

657
00:58:06,415 --> 00:58:08,735
Okay, well,
your secret is safe with me.

658
00:58:08,895 --> 00:58:12,055
<i>Annie really liked you, and
you know what they say about kids.</i>

659
00:58:12,255 --> 00:58:15,575
<i>Along with dogs, they're terrific
judges of character.</i>

660
00:58:16,455 --> 00:58:19,375
What can I say?
I would have to agree.

661
00:58:20,335 --> 00:58:22,535
I'm a total catch.

662
00:58:30,135 --> 00:58:31,615
Hi, Ray.

663
00:58:46,135 --> 00:58:48,495
- Where's Griffin?
- Haven't seen him.

664
00:58:49,335 --> 00:58:51,095
Brooks wants to see you.

665
00:58:51,255 --> 00:58:52,895
- Now?
- Now.

666
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:33,175
- Agent Marsh, sir.
- Yeah, send her in.

667
00:59:36,895 --> 00:59:38,815
You wanted to see me, sir?

668
00:59:39,335 --> 00:59:41,015
How are you doing?

669
00:59:41,455 --> 00:59:45,295
Well, it was an interesting start
of the day. We're fine.

670
00:59:46,175 --> 00:59:47,615
Good.

671
00:59:47,895 --> 00:59:50,135
I want you to know
I did follow up with the NSA.

672
00:59:50,335 --> 00:59:53,655
As far as using their supercomputer
goes, unfortunately the answer's no.

673
00:59:55,495 --> 00:59:58,215
- Why not?
- They're barred for domestic use.

674
00:59:58,375 --> 01:00:02,255
Domestic? We've got him using
mirrors in Russia, Malaysia...

675
01:00:02,415 --> 01:00:05,335
It's too public a forum. They
don't want their capabilities known.

676
01:00:05,535 --> 01:00:06,895
As far as what they can and...

677
01:00:24,935 --> 01:00:27,575
It's Griffin. It's Griffin!

678
01:00:32,215 --> 01:00:34,615
Where do these tubes lead?
What are those tanks?

679
01:00:34,775 --> 01:00:36,415
Tim! Punch in on those tanks.

680
01:00:39,415 --> 01:00:41,015
What's that say?

681
01:00:41,215 --> 01:00:42,255
"Sulfuric acid"?

682
01:00:43,255 --> 01:00:44,535
Sulfuric acid?

683
01:00:50,175 --> 01:00:51,855
If that's water in that tank...

684
01:00:52,415 --> 01:00:55,015
...pretty soon he's gonna be
sitting in battery acid.

685
01:01:29,055 --> 01:01:31,215
Don't wanna hear about
bureaus and jurisdictions.

686
01:01:31,375 --> 01:01:33,935
This is domestic terrorism,
plain and simple.

687
01:01:36,055 --> 01:01:39,455
Yeah? Well, just get it done.
Yeah. All right.

688
01:01:53,375 --> 01:01:57,015
You know, if no one was watching
right now, you'd just be sitting in water.

689
01:02:00,935 --> 01:02:04,695
But the whole world wants to watch
you die, and they don't even know you.

690
01:02:23,415 --> 01:02:25,655
It's so fast this time.

691
01:02:27,095 --> 01:02:29,335
It's word of mouth, I guess.

692
01:02:30,895 --> 01:02:32,975
Because I let you keep your badge on.

693
01:03:42,415 --> 01:03:45,295
Ray! I need your help.

694
01:03:50,895 --> 01:03:53,175
Tim, go in on his eyes.

695
01:03:57,375 --> 01:04:01,015
I think he's trying to say something
to us. Here.

696
01:04:01,655 --> 01:04:04,935
Please. Do your best. Hurry!

697
01:04:08,695 --> 01:04:10,735
Right eye's dots.

698
01:04:10,895 --> 01:04:13,335
Left is... Left is dashes.

699
01:04:20,935 --> 01:04:22,415
"S."

700
01:04:34,095 --> 01:04:35,615
"I."

701
01:04:39,695 --> 01:04:41,055
"D."

702
01:05:12,535 --> 01:05:14,495
<i>There aren't any other kids here...</i>

703
01:05:14,655 --> 01:05:17,535
<i>...but the swimming pool's fun
and there's satellite TV.</i>

704
01:05:18,175 --> 01:05:20,135
<i>Mom, are you there?</i>

705
01:05:22,615 --> 01:05:24,375
<i>We miss you, Mommy.
When are you coming?</i>

706
01:05:24,535 --> 01:05:28,695
<i>It's starting to get really boring.
Your work isn't done yet?</i>

707
01:05:29,335 --> 01:05:31,095
I wish.

708
01:05:33,655 --> 01:05:35,175
<i>Mom?</i>

709
01:05:36,095 --> 01:05:37,135
I have to go now, honey.

710
01:05:37,495 --> 01:05:40,015
Listen, you call me
as soon as you wake up. Okay, bug?

711
01:05:40,175 --> 01:05:43,575
<i>- It's Box.
- I will. Love you. Say hi to Griffin.</i>

712
01:05:43,735 --> 01:05:47,375
I love you too, honey. Bye.

713
01:06:10,855 --> 01:06:12,495
Dinner.

714
01:06:22,175 --> 01:06:24,615
I think I'll take a shower first.

715
01:06:54,415 --> 01:06:59,615
The acid was stolen from a research
lab at Marshall Junior College.

716
01:07:02,095 --> 01:07:05,295
The thief apparently knew
his way around.

717
01:07:08,535 --> 01:07:12,815
Looks like... Looks like Griffin
was baited with a phone call.

718
01:07:12,975 --> 01:07:16,695
But we can't trace it because
it was made with a spoof card.

719
01:07:16,855 --> 01:07:19,535
Yeah, it's a phone card.
Costs about 10 bucks an hour.

720
01:07:19,695 --> 01:07:22,575
Lets you program any
caller ID you want.

721
01:07:23,735 --> 01:07:27,415
This guy breached my laptop.
He must've owned Griffin's too.

722
01:07:27,575 --> 01:07:29,975
Figured out where he was vulnerable.

723
01:07:35,175 --> 01:07:36,855
Sorry.

724
01:07:40,055 --> 01:07:42,655
I'm good at a lot of things, you know?

725
01:07:43,575 --> 01:07:45,975
But I'm not good at losing people.

726
01:07:46,135 --> 01:07:48,935
I'm bad at losing people.

727
01:08:57,815 --> 01:08:59,455
Rush-hour suicide.

728
01:09:00,615 --> 01:09:04,975
I'm pretty sure that's what Griffin was
trying to say. I'm just not sure why.

729
01:09:08,055 --> 01:09:09,735
Yeah, I remember.

730
01:09:09,895 --> 01:09:12,815
He was a professor, that guy.

731
01:09:13,255 --> 01:09:16,575
Andrew Kilburn included this
in his greatest hits.

732
01:09:18,575 --> 01:09:22,455
- I was just there, like a week ago.
- Where?

733
01:09:22,695 --> 01:09:26,735
At the Bridge Diner. You know, the
one under the Broadway Bridge.

734
01:09:27,335 --> 01:09:29,895
I was talking to Scotty Hillman...

735
01:09:30,055 --> 01:09:32,375
...the guy who owned the cat.
That's where he works.

736
01:09:33,975 --> 01:09:36,215
What was this guy's name?
Do you remember?

737
01:09:37,655 --> 01:09:41,095
No. I think
he taught Chemistry, though.

738
01:09:43,895 --> 01:09:46,335
At Marshall Junior College?

739
01:09:53,655 --> 01:09:57,695
Andrew Kilburn, a sophomore at
Portland State. Died last month...

740
01:09:57,855 --> 01:10:01,295
...but that didn't stop him
from recommending, after he died...

741
01:10:01,455 --> 01:10:04,695
...a new website called
killwithme. Com.

742
01:10:05,015 --> 01:10:08,935
How'd he do that? He didn't.
The killer did, using his account.

743
01:10:09,095 --> 01:10:11,735
When Agent Griffin Dowd's
investigation revealed why...

744
01:10:11,895 --> 01:10:13,935
...this deceased college student
was chosen...

745
01:10:14,095 --> 01:10:18,095
...to promote the Kill With Me site,
it cost him his life.

746
01:10:22,175 --> 01:10:24,375
This is James Reilly.

747
01:10:24,695 --> 01:10:25,895
Sixteen months ago...

748
01:10:26,055 --> 01:10:28,975
...depressed over the recent death
of his wife, a hematologist...

749
01:10:29,135 --> 01:10:33,175
...Reilly staggered out into rush-hour
traffic on the Broadway Bridge.

750
01:10:33,335 --> 01:10:35,175
Traffic copters were out in force...

751
01:10:35,335 --> 01:10:38,095
...but only one caught all the action
from beginning to end...

752
01:10:38,255 --> 01:10:39,615
...Channel 12.

753
01:10:40,255 --> 01:10:43,735
The regular pilot was out sick that day,
so the job went to Herbert Miller.

754
01:10:45,175 --> 01:10:49,855
He later told friends he'd gotten lucky.
At the right place at the right time.

755
01:10:54,455 --> 01:10:55,895
The back of Reilly's skull...

756
01:10:56,055 --> 01:10:59,455
...landed on the rooftop
of this diner. So did his glasses.

757
01:10:59,615 --> 01:11:01,495
The skull was turned over
to the coroner...

758
01:11:01,655 --> 01:11:05,015
...but the glasses were retrieved
by one of the diner's employees...

759
01:11:05,175 --> 01:11:06,335
...Scotty Hillman.

760
01:11:07,135 --> 01:11:08,975
He put them up for sale online.

761
01:11:09,135 --> 01:11:10,815
And they sold quickly.

762
01:11:10,975 --> 01:11:13,175
Kids were home from school.
Parents were outraged.

763
01:11:13,335 --> 01:11:15,775
They called the TV stations.
The TV stations apologized.

764
01:11:15,935 --> 01:11:17,295
Except for Channel 12.

765
01:11:17,455 --> 01:11:20,775
They'd been having a little problem
in the ratings, but not that afternoon.

766
01:11:20,935 --> 01:11:22,495
Their numbers were sky-high.

767
01:11:22,655 --> 01:11:25,095
And knowing a good thing
when it fell into their lap...

768
01:11:25,255 --> 01:11:27,455
...they rushed a veteran reporter
to the scene.

769
01:11:27,615 --> 01:11:28,775
<i>This is David Williams...</i>

770
01:11:28,935 --> 01:11:31,655
He got lucky, landed an interview
with a local businessman...

771
01:11:31,815 --> 01:11:34,735
...whose parked Cadillac had been
struck by Reilly's falling body.

772
01:11:34,935 --> 01:11:36,135
When the interview ended...

773
01:11:36,295 --> 01:11:39,175
...Channel 12, as a courtesy to
those who might have missed it...

774
01:11:39,335 --> 01:11:41,615
...aired the entire video one last time.

775
01:11:41,775 --> 01:11:44,415
Within minutes, Andrew Kilburn
had pulled it off his TiVo...

776
01:11:44,575 --> 01:11:47,575
...and posted it on five different
shock-video sites.

777
01:11:47,735 --> 01:11:50,735
From there, Reilly's suicide
was public domain.

778
01:11:50,935 --> 01:11:55,855
Something for five billion people
to feed on, laugh at, gossip about.

779
01:11:56,015 --> 01:11:57,855
Reilly had a son, Owen.

780
01:11:58,935 --> 01:12:02,175
He was brilliant. Good at electronics,
mechanics and computers...

781
01:12:02,335 --> 01:12:05,535
<i>...but he was disturbed.
He was troubled. He was withdrawn.</i>

782
01:12:06,135 --> 01:12:08,375
Owen took his father's suicide
very hard.

783
01:12:08,535 --> 01:12:12,175
He had to be hospitalized.
And six months ago he was released.

784
01:12:12,895 --> 01:12:15,655
This x-ray image is supposed to be
Owen's father.

785
01:12:15,815 --> 01:12:18,415
The number on the left,
the date his father died...

786
01:12:19,375 --> 01:12:22,495
...followed by the number
of his autopsy report.

787
01:12:22,895 --> 01:12:25,655
<i>Owen lives alone now
at his father's house in Fairview.</i>

788
01:12:25,815 --> 01:12:28,015
What do you say we arrest
the piece of shit?

789
01:12:29,775 --> 01:12:31,375
Go! Go!

790
01:13:05,495 --> 01:13:06,735
Basement's clear!

791
01:13:21,175 --> 01:13:22,895
This is bad.

792
01:13:55,095 --> 01:13:58,015
<i>There are new developments
in the Internet murder investigation...</i>

793
01:13:58,175 --> 01:14:01,535
<i>...tonight out of Portland, Oregon.
For more, let's turn to Marilyn Deutsch.</i>

794
01:14:01,695 --> 01:14:04,335
<i>Right. Police now say they know
who is kidnapping people...</i>

795
01:14:04,495 --> 01:14:07,295
<i>...in this area and then killing them
live on the Web.</i>

796
01:14:07,655 --> 01:14:11,255
<i>Take a look at this picture. Police say
the suspect's name is Owen Reilly.</i>

797
01:14:11,415 --> 01:14:15,055
<i>He is 20 years old,
and just nine months ago...</i>

798
01:14:15,735 --> 01:14:17,295
First...

799
01:14:17,455 --> 01:14:20,815
...I just wanted to say how sorry I am.

800
01:14:21,375 --> 01:14:24,055
This was a loss for all of us...

801
01:14:24,215 --> 01:14:27,295
...but most deeply for you,
and we know that. I know that.

802
01:14:29,335 --> 01:14:33,695
You've done everything you
possibly could. You've given enough.

803
01:14:34,855 --> 01:14:38,335
- I want you to take some time off.
- What?

804
01:14:38,815 --> 01:14:41,775
Why? Because now it's personal?

805
01:14:41,975 --> 01:14:44,135
This guy's still running around,
the case is open.

806
01:14:44,295 --> 01:14:45,615
The kid's face is everywhere.

807
01:14:45,775 --> 01:14:48,975
He's driving around in a 40-year-old
VW bus with electronics in it.

808
01:14:49,175 --> 01:14:50,735
We'll have him
by this time tomorrow.

809
01:14:50,935 --> 01:14:54,135
- Maybe.
- Jennifer, I'm not only thinking of you.

810
01:14:55,535 --> 01:14:58,695
Now join your family. Just for a week.

811
01:15:00,975 --> 01:15:03,015
I'll take a day.

812
01:15:51,215 --> 01:15:53,455
- Hey.
- Hey.

813
01:15:53,975 --> 01:15:56,895
So, what'd he say?

814
01:15:57,655 --> 01:15:59,655
He told me to get lost.

815
01:16:01,255 --> 01:16:02,575
Well, he's right.

816
01:16:05,335 --> 01:16:07,375
And what did you say?

817
01:16:13,055 --> 01:16:14,815
That's what I figured.

818
01:18:02,655 --> 01:18:05,215
<i>This has been America News Radio.</i>

819
01:18:05,375 --> 01:18:08,735

ANR station for news.</i>

820

the most serious Internet crime wave...</i>

828
01:18:35,495 --> 01:18:37,935
<i>...since the computer age began...</i>

829
01:19:22,295 --> 01:19:23,255
Shit!

830
01:19:25,575 --> 01:19:27,215
<i>Hello, Jennifer.</i>

831
01:19:32,615 --> 01:19:34,415
<i>Look out the front window.</i>

832
01:19:35,175 --> 01:19:37,335
<i>Under that streetlight.</i>

833
01:19:38,615 --> 01:19:41,615
<i>That's where my father's body
fell over the railing.</i>

834
01:19:41,815 --> 01:19:44,095
<i>Some websites show the whole
thing in slow motion...</i>

835
01:19:44,255 --> 01:19:47,375
<i>...because it's just so much
better that way.</i>

836
01:19:49,095 --> 01:19:52,015
<i>One archives it in a section
called "whoa. "</i>

837
01:19:52,695 --> 01:19:56,055
<i>That's it. Just "whoa. "</i>

838
01:19:57,335 --> 01:19:59,375
<i>You and the people you work with...</i>

839
01:20:00,375 --> 01:20:03,375
<i>...you let people say and do
almost anything they want.</i>

840
01:20:03,535 --> 01:20:05,615
<i>It doesn't matter who it hurts.</i>

841
01:20:08,935 --> 01:20:10,975
I'm sorry, Owen.

842
01:20:14,535 --> 01:20:16,455
Owen, are you there?

843
01:20:50,455 --> 01:20:52,015
<i>- Call Answering Center.
- Listen.</i>

844
01:20:52,175 --> 01:20:53,615
I'm an agent with the FBI.

845
01:20:53,815 --> 01:20:56,775
I need you to connect me
to the Portland field office.

846
01:20:56,935 --> 01:20:57,975
Do you understand?

847
01:21:10,095 --> 01:21:12,455
<i>- Yeah.
- It's Owen!</i>

848
01:21:12,655 --> 01:21:15,295
He's hacked into my car's
computer and my cell phone.

849
01:21:15,455 --> 01:21:16,855
I'm on the Broadway Bridge.

850
01:21:17,015 --> 01:21:19,455
Don't move. I'll send a
black-and-white. Stay there.

851
01:21:19,815 --> 01:21:21,255
All right.

852
01:22:17,175 --> 01:22:19,175
<i>- Box.
- Lieutenant, I'm on the bridge.</i>

853
01:22:19,335 --> 01:22:20,695
<i>There's no sign of Marsh.</i>

854
01:22:20,855 --> 01:22:23,615
Okay. Relay that to FBI Portland.
I'm minutes away.

855
01:22:24,455 --> 01:22:26,615
- Hurry. Get the director on the phone.
- Yes, sir.

856
01:22:26,775 --> 01:22:29,135
Shut down every road to and from
the Broadway Bridge.

857
01:22:29,295 --> 01:22:31,215
Every car gets stopped now.

858
01:23:30,375 --> 01:23:33,495
I need you to run a check
on a 2006 Saab.

859
01:23:33,655 --> 01:23:36,175
Get me a location, start tracking.
Name: Jennifer Marsh.

860
01:23:36,335 --> 01:23:37,975
Portland, Oregon.

861
01:24:17,855 --> 01:24:20,855
Fucker disabled her car's computer.
We can't track her.

862
01:24:30,095 --> 01:24:31,415
Hello.

863
01:25:11,215 --> 01:25:12,815
You know...

864
01:25:13,015 --> 01:25:17,255
...I'm only doing to you
what they're going to do to me.

865
01:25:18,415 --> 01:25:19,975
Only...

866
01:25:20,255 --> 01:25:25,215
...they'll use potassium chloride, and
they won't let very many people watch.

867
01:25:26,615 --> 01:25:28,615
But not for long.

868
01:25:32,135 --> 01:25:33,455
You see, soon...

869
01:25:34,815 --> 01:25:39,455
...executions will be delivered
live to our TVs...

870
01:25:39,895 --> 01:25:44,655
...our computers, our phones,
our handhelds...

871
01:25:45,135 --> 01:25:47,895
...and it won't cost much.

872
01:25:48,055 --> 01:25:50,975
Maybe 10 bucks.

873
01:25:59,255 --> 01:26:01,055
Millions of eyes...

874
01:26:02,655 --> 01:26:05,935
...all watching the same thing
at the same time.

875
01:26:06,855 --> 01:26:09,255
One big, happy family.

876
01:26:11,095 --> 01:26:13,175
And all of it brought to you by...

877
01:26:18,575 --> 01:26:20,415
It doesn't matter.

878
01:26:24,175 --> 01:26:26,735
They'll have no trouble
finding sponsors.

879
01:26:57,335 --> 01:26:59,695
What's going on?
We have a signal?

880
01:26:59,855 --> 01:27:01,055
We're still locked out.

881
01:27:01,215 --> 01:27:03,495
- Stay on it.
- Yes, sir.

882
01:27:25,015 --> 01:27:28,175
I wonder if they'll kill you
faster or slower.

883
01:27:30,415 --> 01:27:32,975
Based on what I've seen online...

884
01:27:33,815 --> 01:27:37,295
...the awful things that men do to
women that other men pay to watch...

885
01:27:41,415 --> 01:27:43,815
...my guess would be faster.

886
01:27:47,495 --> 01:27:49,335
Much faster.

887
01:28:07,735 --> 01:28:10,135
Jesus Christ, it's Marsh!

888
01:28:22,975 --> 01:28:26,415
- This is Box.
- It's Brooks. He's got Marsh on his site.

889
01:28:27,375 --> 01:28:29,015
Send it to me.

890
01:29:45,775 --> 01:29:47,695
You're giving me my best numbers.

891
01:29:51,455 --> 01:29:54,415
That's... That's her basement.
He's got her in her own basement.

892
01:30:08,615 --> 01:30:09,975
No, no.

893
01:30:21,695 --> 01:30:23,855
- Did you see that?
- Fuck!

894
01:30:26,455 --> 01:30:27,935
Fuck!

895
01:30:49,495 --> 01:30:50,975
Yes!
