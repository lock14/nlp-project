1
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:42,145
Battle in Heaven

2
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:06,861
Shit! How did it happen?

3
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:10,728
Okay, goodbye.

4
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:12,962
l'll be right there.

5
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:14,039
Yeah, bye.

6
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:15,563
Okay, goodbye.

7
00:07:39,058 --> 00:07:40,650
So the baby didn't even cry?

8
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,793
Just a little scream.

9
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,658
What a fuck-up.

10
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:54,163
Yeah, too bad about the money.

11
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,201
l'm not talking about that.

12
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,843
You're right. Poor Viky.

13
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:03,880
Poor Viky? The baby died, not its mother.

14
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:05,716
Understand?

15
00:08:06,552 --> 00:08:07,780
Yeah.

16
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,411
Yeah, yeah. You and your '' yeahs.''

17
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,062
Ma'am?

18
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,366
Ma'am!

19
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:31,136
-What's for sale?
-Everything there.

20
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:33,010
How much are the clocks?

21
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,544
Depends which one.

22
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,944
How many hands do they have?

23
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,342
Four.

24
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:40,583
Are these ''made in Taiwan''?

25
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:42,951
They were shipped from Paris.

26
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,054
ls the jelly free?

27
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,392
No, you have to pay for it.

28
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:48,789
How much is it?

29
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:51,193
Depends, there are water ones
and milk ones.

30
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:52,823
What flavours?

31
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:56,366
Strawberry, eggnog, toffee, coconut,

32
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:01,399
anise seed, lemon, cherry...

33
00:09:12,084 --> 00:09:14,746
Hurry up, you brat, l'm late!

34
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:31,885
l'm going to the airport to pick up
the General's daughter.

35
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:34,788
l'll see you tonight.

36
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:36,956
What's in the cakes?

37
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:39,888
One moment, please.

38
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:41,827
As usual.

39
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:46,765
Sorry, what is it you wanted?

40
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:49,238
-What's in the cakes?
-Sugus.

41
00:11:49,341 --> 00:11:50,968
-How much are they?
-40 pesos.

42
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:52,542
l'll have one.

43
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:54,870
Here's 50.

44
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:57,078
Here's your change.

45
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:58,480
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

46
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:54,362
Your jacket, mister!

47
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:03,035
ls he drunk or what?

48
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:04,506
Excuse me, please.

49
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:09,912
Stop it, you pervert!
What are you looking at?

50
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:18,188
Thank you.

51
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:03,289
Hello, Marcos.

52
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:07,359
Hello?

53
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:11,228
They sent you to Cancun?

54
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:15,766
What a pain in the ass.

55
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:21,664
The thing is, l wanted to see you so bad,
so l came back early.

56
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:26,303
To see you.

57
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,342
Fine.

58
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:34,445
What are you talking about?

59
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:45,256
Well, if you interrogate me,
l might become suspicious.

60
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:52,192
Well, we'll see.

61
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,565
l'll stay at your place for the weekend, okay?

62
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:01,076
l'll call my parents and tell them
l'm not coming until Sunday.

63
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:04,077
You won't be back before noon?

64
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:09,715
ln that case, l'm going to work tonight.

65
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:12,780
And in the morning,
l'll come sleep at your place.

66
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:14,887
Wake me up when you arrive.

67
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:20,359
Yes, l really want to see you.

68
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,136
That sounds good.

69
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:35,177
Of course, Jaime.

70
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:43,377
l won't hang up, darling, but don't be long.

71
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:03,136
Remember, Marcos?

72
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:07,041
Of course, Ana. That was for many years.
How could l forget?

73
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,580
Yeah, but wasn't it much better
when l was there?

74
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:13,416
-Yes, Ana--
-You're back, love?

75
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,716
lt's just that we went past my old school,

76
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,621
and l asked Marcos
if he remembered driving me there.

77
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,192
What a pain.

78
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:27,195
l hope you will.

79
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:03,032
Really?

80
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:06,203
Let's see how you talk in bed, then.

81
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:11,576
Yeah?

82
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:14,769
See you tomorrow.

83
00:20:18,183 --> 00:20:19,309
Listen...

84
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:22,612
l love you.

85
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:31,222
Let's go to the boutique instead, Marcos.

86
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,491
l'll turn at the corner, Ana.

87
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,193
Jaime's ice skates are fixed, Ana.

88
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:37,393
Did they do a good job?

89
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:40,267
Great, Ana, l took them to a digital engineer.

90
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:45,037
Here they are.

91
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,860
Razor-sharp.

92
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:08,788
Pardon?

93
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:12,996
Nothing, just turn the music on, Marcos.

94
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:07,625
Wake up, you fucking piece of shit.
And go fuck your mother, you faggot!

95
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,984
Get moving, damn it!

96
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:20,436
Now turn off the music, Marcos.

97
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:33,007
Are you all right, Marcos?

98
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:36,515
lt's just my mother. Her body's very swollen.

99
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:38,913
ls that all?

100
00:22:39,057 --> 00:22:40,615
Yes, Ana.

101
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:43,891
Well, l've never seen you so absent-minded.

102
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:45,256
No, Ana.

103
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:50,157
Well, at the boutique, you're coming in
so l can set you up with one of my friends.

104
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:53,765
Can we do it another day, Ana?

105
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,530
Don't tell me you're faithful to your wife.

106
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:01,076
Yes, Ana.
But sometimes l go out with other women.

107
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:04,711
You've always wanted
to see the boutique, right?

108
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:07,643
Yeah, whatever you say, Ana.

109
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:23,829
Lie down.

110
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:54,524
Ana!

111
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:59,633
The fatso can't get it up.
He says he only wants it with you.

112
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,275
What are you doing, Marcos?

113
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:39,274
l was just taking the condom off.

114
00:24:57,729 --> 00:25:00,163
You've worked for my dad for 15 years.

115
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:02,690
You've known me since l was a child.

116
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:05,329
You're the only one who knows
about this place.

117
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:06,630
And l finally invite you here,

118
00:25:06,771 --> 00:25:08,966
and you go telling my friends
you want to screw me?

119
00:25:09,074 --> 00:25:10,371
What's up with that?

120
00:25:10,475 --> 00:25:13,410
All l said was that
you told me to come here, Ana.

121
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:17,312
You think l didn't notice
how you stared at me at the airport?

122
00:25:20,485 --> 00:25:21,782
What's wrong?

123
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,315
Tell me.

124
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:28,756
The thing is, my wife and l kidnapped
a baby, and he died this morning.

125
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:55,371
lt was an accident.

126
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,020
Why are you telling me this, Marcos?

127
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:24,974
You asked me.

128
00:27:32,884 --> 00:27:35,182
You shouldn't talk about things like that.

129
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:50,896
Take my bags to Jaime's.
The maid will open the door for you.

130
00:27:52,937 --> 00:27:55,838
Take the car with you as well.
See you on Monday.

131
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:00,242
Now leave, Marcos.

132
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,551
Just don't tell anyone.

133
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:41,212
MEXlCO ClTY
Welcome to Cuajimalpa

134
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:19,438
Fill it up?

135
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:20,813
Pardon? Yes.

136
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:21,970
Mexico loves you
We are never sad

137
00:31:22,113 --> 00:31:28,484
Because the heart is inflamed
Upon mentioning your name

138
00:31:28,653 --> 00:31:32,111
The world knows that
Your name is our lullaby

139
00:31:32,257 --> 00:31:36,523
You are our pride
Mexico is yours

140
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:40,563
And you hold the key

141
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:45,331
Long live the Queen of the Mexicans

142
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:49,429
Who planted beautiful roses
With her own hands

143
00:32:18,536 --> 00:32:19,798
What do you think?

144
00:32:20,672 --> 00:32:22,264
They're all sheep.

145
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:28,077
How many are there?

146
00:32:28,346 --> 00:32:30,871
The pilgrims have been coming
for three days and nights.

147
00:32:33,051 --> 00:32:34,916
But l was talking about the car...

148
00:32:38,256 --> 00:32:39,917
and the engine is fine.

149
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:40,348
We're almost there.

150
00:33:51,996 --> 00:33:53,623
Careful, careful.

151
00:34:04,275 --> 00:34:05,765
What's this music, son?

152
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,636
Don't worry, Grandma.

153
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:10,638
Mister!

154
00:34:10,815 --> 00:34:12,976
Put in 200 pesos, please!

155
00:34:13,284 --> 00:34:15,218
And change that music now!

156
00:34:52,957 --> 00:34:54,754
lrving, lrving.

157
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,860
lrving, lrving.

158
00:34:56,961 --> 00:34:58,895
Wake up, your dad's here.

159
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:00,129
lrving.

160
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:47,845
Sorry about this morning.

161
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:19,809
We've got to talk.

162
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:36,443
Did you lose your glasses, love?

163
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:44,247
They were all scratched anyway.

164
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:48,349
l've got your old pair here.

165
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:27,563
l told Ana.

166
00:39:31,435 --> 00:39:33,130
Your boss's daughter?

167
00:39:34,472 --> 00:39:36,269
Are you fucking crazy or what?

168
00:39:36,807 --> 00:39:38,035
l feel better.

169
00:39:49,286 --> 00:39:51,447
You're not well, are you, love?

170
00:39:57,895 --> 00:39:59,260
l understand.

171
00:40:00,631 --> 00:40:03,156
Now you'll have to make sure
she keeps her mouth shut.

172
00:40:03,667 --> 00:40:06,101
We can't have the princess talking.

173
00:40:07,671 --> 00:40:09,400
You better leave her out of this.

174
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:12,033
You fucked up, you idiot!

175
00:40:30,461 --> 00:40:32,656
That fucking Viky came crying to me today.

176
00:40:33,164 --> 00:40:36,759
She said she's had no news
from the kidnappers for three days.

177
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:40,301
l'm afraid that if we don't call her tonight,
she'll go to the police.

178
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:50,202
lf her husband were still alive,
he'd have broken both our necks.

179
00:40:53,317 --> 00:40:55,547
Should we go to Sunday's pilgrimage?

180
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:58,114
Where do you get
these fucking stupid ideas?

181
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:04,955
After all the shit we've done,
don't you get it?

182
00:42:25,943 --> 00:42:27,877
He's not big enough to come by himself?

183
00:42:27,945 --> 00:42:29,640
Why don't you ask him?

184
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:31,111
Stop it, Dad!

185
00:42:35,753 --> 00:42:37,345
Your pet is waiting for you.

186
00:42:38,122 --> 00:42:39,817
l brought your car, Ana.

187
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:43,451
Go prove you're a man, Son.

188
00:42:47,164 --> 00:42:49,291
-Bye, handsome.
-Thank you.

189
00:42:53,704 --> 00:42:56,036
-Wait for me outside.
-Yes, Ana.

190
00:44:21,392 --> 00:44:23,417
Fuck off, you faggots!

191
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:31,500
l gave her some back door action!

192
00:44:31,635 --> 00:44:34,502
Tona, Juanita, come get our stuff
from the trunk.

193
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:37,469
What's ''back door action''?

194
00:44:37,608 --> 00:44:38,836
Back door action?

195
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:42,172
You'll learn soon enough, my dear.

196
00:45:14,778 --> 00:45:16,143
Watch out!

197
00:45:19,116 --> 00:45:20,344
Good morning, Juanito.

198
00:45:20,451 --> 00:45:22,578
-How are you, Tonita?
-Good, good.

199
00:45:23,087 --> 00:45:25,180
-Hello, Tonita.
-Hello.

200
00:45:28,992 --> 00:45:30,584
Get inside, lnes.

201
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:31,956
What time is this to come home?

202
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:35,190
-l'll tell your parents.
-Come on, Tonita.

203
00:45:41,271 --> 00:45:43,171
Good morning, fatso.

204
00:45:52,149 --> 00:45:53,878
What do you want, Marcos?

205
00:46:06,964 --> 00:46:09,091
l told you l'd see you Monday, Marcos.

206
00:46:09,166 --> 00:46:10,861
l wanted to tell you something, Ana.

207
00:46:11,335 --> 00:46:12,529
Good morning.

208
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:13,930
Good morning.

209
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:54,910
He likes to listen to the birds.

210
00:47:24,141 --> 00:47:26,609
What you really want is to fuck me,
right, Marcos?

211
00:47:27,544 --> 00:47:28,738
No, Ana.

212
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,347
Where's the car?

213
00:47:31,448 --> 00:47:32,881
Up the road.

214
00:47:33,383 --> 00:47:34,782
We just came that way.

215
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:36,479
You didn't ask me before.

216
00:49:21,325 --> 00:49:22,952
Calm down, Marcos!

217
00:53:26,136 --> 00:53:28,229
You'll have to turn yourself in, Marcos.

218
00:55:05,669 --> 00:55:08,001
You have to go now, Marcos.

219
00:56:36,192 --> 00:56:37,591
Ladies and gentlemen.

220
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:39,820
Twenty seconds from now,

221
00:56:39,929 --> 00:56:42,830
the Pumas will once again
be crowned champions of Mexico.

222
00:56:43,032 --> 00:56:45,262
This is one of the most prestigious squads
in the country,

223
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:47,563
and it has been an endless source of talent.

224
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:49,968
An institution that loves football
more than anything

225
00:56:50,039 --> 00:56:52,030
and is allergic to showboating.

226
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:54,767
There's no room for ball hogs on the Pumas.

227
00:56:54,944 --> 00:56:58,141
The Pumas are home
to artists and imagination.

228
00:56:59,983 --> 00:57:02,349
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Pumas are champions.

229
00:57:02,485 --> 00:57:04,282
The champions of Mexico.

230
00:57:04,454 --> 00:57:07,821
How our league has changed
since it's moved to just one championship.

231
00:57:08,057 --> 00:57:09,684
Now we have established a general league,

232
00:57:09,793 --> 00:57:12,591
the ridiculous sale of franchises
has stopped,

233
00:57:12,729 --> 00:57:14,822
reason has prevailed

234
00:57:14,964 --> 00:57:19,264
and we've seen the end of speculators
who think this is the NBA.

235
00:57:19,402 --> 00:57:22,667
lt's good for Mexican football
and it's good for Mexico.

236
00:57:22,806 --> 00:57:26,105
And now over to Andre,
on the field with Vignatti.

237
00:57:26,242 --> 00:57:28,972
Here is the great Argentine keeper, Vignatti.

238
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:31,376
Finally a champion with the Pumas.
How do you feel?

239
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:34,178
As they would say
in your country, ''super cool''.

240
00:57:34,651 --> 00:57:37,620
This is really an exciting moment
in my career.

241
00:57:37,687 --> 00:57:38,881
This is a fantasy.

242
00:57:39,022 --> 00:57:41,354
This is the best thing
that has happened to Vignatti in 10 years.

243
00:57:41,491 --> 00:57:44,085
l want to thank my family,

244
00:57:45,094 --> 00:57:47,688
who convinced me to come to Mexico.

245
00:57:47,831 --> 00:57:51,699
This is a huge league,
the Pumas are a major team.

246
00:57:51,835 --> 00:57:57,467
Now we'll go and celebrate
with our families in Argentina,

247
00:57:58,274 --> 00:58:01,300
with our wives and friends...

248
00:58:04,781 --> 00:58:06,612
This is a fantasy.

249
00:58:10,954 --> 00:58:12,785
This is a fantasy.

250
00:58:14,057 --> 00:58:16,753
The best thing
that ever happened to Vignatti.

251
00:58:16,826 --> 00:58:18,020
The best thing.

252
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:25,960
Dad! Dad!

253
00:58:26,069 --> 00:58:28,970
Hurry up. We're going to the countryside!

254
00:58:29,405 --> 00:58:33,774
Marcos, my love, don't make the family wait.

255
00:58:34,210 --> 00:58:36,201
What are you doing, Dad?

256
00:59:14,617 --> 00:59:16,517
Stop crying, Viky.

257
00:59:16,586 --> 00:59:18,747
You'll see your baby very soon.

258
00:59:19,522 --> 00:59:22,548
And everything will be fine. Just calm down.

259
01:00:25,254 --> 01:00:27,313
Tomorrow's the pilgrimage.

260
01:00:30,093 --> 01:00:32,084
Tomorrow l'm turning myself in
to the police.

261
01:00:54,117 --> 01:00:55,277
Forgive me.

262
01:00:58,454 --> 01:01:01,218
We'll be separated,
but you'll always be in my heart.

263
01:01:06,262 --> 01:01:08,093
l couldn't live without you.

264
01:01:20,877 --> 01:01:22,936
Please wait one more day.

265
01:01:25,248 --> 01:01:27,580
Wait for the pilgrimage.

266
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:30,683
l feel something's going to happen there.

267
01:01:32,555 --> 01:01:34,682
Something's going to change.

268
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:38,684
What's one more day, for God's sake?

269
01:01:57,413 --> 01:01:59,938
Okay. Now promise.

270
01:02:02,251 --> 01:02:03,741
Swear on our love.

271
01:02:18,634 --> 01:02:20,158
Thanks, love.

272
01:02:23,106 --> 01:02:24,971
Are you raising the flag tomorrow?

273
01:02:25,074 --> 01:02:26,803
Yeah, l have to go twice.

274
01:02:27,477 --> 01:02:30,605
Well, after you've raised it at dawn,

275
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:34,273
come pick me up at home
so we can go together on the pilgrimage.

276
01:02:35,184 --> 01:02:38,585
Then at sunset l'll go with you
to bring the flag down.

277
01:02:39,655 --> 01:02:41,987
l haven't seen you in action for a long time.

278
01:02:43,092 --> 01:02:44,024
Okay.

279
01:02:45,928 --> 01:02:48,226
The changing light is making my eyes itch.

280
01:03:10,486 --> 01:03:12,681
Children, stop playing around!

281
01:03:12,822 --> 01:03:14,084
You're going to get dirty.

282
01:03:14,223 --> 01:03:16,817
Who do you think does the washing?

283
01:03:16,926 --> 01:03:19,793
Give it to your mother,
or l'll give you a smack.

284
01:03:25,301 --> 01:03:28,099
l'm looking for a stick now. You'll be sorry.

285
01:03:28,604 --> 01:03:31,164
Come here. Do you hear me?

286
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:46,284
Come over here, children! l can't see you!

287
01:03:46,389 --> 01:03:47,947
lt's dangerous to play like that!

288
01:03:48,090 --> 01:03:50,820
Didn't you hear your mother?

289
01:04:08,578 --> 01:04:11,479
Marcos, get in the car!

290
01:09:22,758 --> 01:09:24,555
Good job, Marcos. See you tomorrow.

291
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:27,151
-Yes, General.
-Thank you, lads.

292
01:09:27,563 --> 01:09:28,723
Have a good morning.

293
01:09:40,242 --> 01:09:42,039
-Hi, Marcos.
-Good morning, Jaime.

294
01:09:42,211 --> 01:09:43,200
You've come to see Ana?

295
01:09:43,379 --> 01:09:45,142
-Just for a minute.
-Come in.

296
01:09:45,214 --> 01:09:46,442
Thank you.

297
01:09:46,582 --> 01:09:49,380
Did you wake up on top or underneath
this morning?

298
01:09:50,386 --> 01:09:51,683
On top.

299
01:10:00,963 --> 01:10:03,261
Come into the living room. Don't be stupid!

300
01:10:34,964 --> 01:10:36,454
l'll let Ana know.

301
01:11:58,681 --> 01:12:00,114
Hello, Marcos.

302
01:12:01,250 --> 01:12:03,582
Jaime is going to buy the newspaper.

303
01:12:05,921 --> 01:12:07,047
Yes, Marcos.

304
01:12:07,189 --> 01:12:08,850
l'll be right back.

305
01:12:22,738 --> 01:12:25,229
l'm turning myself in to the police now, Ana.

306
01:12:34,116 --> 01:12:35,549
Sit down then.

307
01:13:35,544 --> 01:13:38,172
You won't mind us being separated, Ana?

308
01:13:39,047 --> 01:13:40,537
No, Marcos.

309
01:13:40,716 --> 01:13:42,047
l'll keep you in my heart.

310
01:13:54,763 --> 01:13:56,094
Goodbye.

311
01:15:02,064 --> 01:15:04,294
You forgot your jacket, Marcos.

312
01:17:06,421 --> 01:17:07,911
Take care, Marcos.

313
01:17:39,054 --> 01:17:40,180
Yes.

314
01:17:44,926 --> 01:17:46,894
What do you mean, ''naked''?

315
01:17:53,802 --> 01:17:56,862
Yes, thank you for letting me know.

316
01:17:57,105 --> 01:17:58,436
Goodbye.

317
01:18:03,745 --> 01:18:05,610
The suspect's mobile phone
was found, lnspector.

318
01:18:05,747 --> 01:18:08,079
He was seen in Polanco five minutes ago

319
01:18:08,216 --> 01:18:10,013
and he was headed to the Basilica.

320
01:18:10,318 --> 01:18:13,913
Some pilgrims found him

321
01:18:13,989 --> 01:18:18,517
and sent him by bus because
they thought he was mentally handicapped.

322
01:18:25,767 --> 01:18:27,735
Ma'am, you're coming with us.

323
01:18:27,836 --> 01:18:30,134
We're going to find that son of a bitch.

324
01:18:31,139 --> 01:18:34,074
And your child stays here
with the lieutenant.

325
01:19:01,603 --> 01:19:03,468
Station calling Blue Wolf.

326
01:19:06,541 --> 01:19:08,600
We have some information from the house.

327
01:19:13,115 --> 01:19:16,573
The kidnapper's son
just led us to a baby's body.

328
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:20,547
Ask for backup, damn it.

329
01:19:28,396 --> 01:19:32,560
Jesus will help you change!

330
01:19:33,969 --> 01:19:38,599
This is the way of the light! Save yourself!

331
01:19:42,444 --> 01:19:44,776
l have the key to salvation!

332
01:19:46,481 --> 01:19:49,575
Forever and ever!

333
01:19:51,186 --> 01:19:54,553
They renounced sex.
Think of the women who left prostitution.

334
01:19:58,994 --> 01:20:00,427
There you are again, brother!

335
01:20:00,562 --> 01:20:05,022
We will help you resist the temptation
that you have been lost in all these years.

336
01:20:05,133 --> 01:20:08,967
God loves you. God protects you.
God loves you.

337
01:20:09,070 --> 01:20:11,800
Take this. Save yourself, brother! Hallelujah!

338
01:20:11,873 --> 01:20:13,807
You are saved! You are saved!

339
01:20:13,975 --> 01:20:18,571
Yes, brothers! This is the proof!
The only proof!

340
01:20:18,747 --> 01:20:21,807
You have your medicine now! Go forward!

341
01:20:21,983 --> 01:20:24,850
No more drugs! No more alcohol!

342
01:20:24,953 --> 01:20:28,582
No more women! No more tits!

343
01:20:28,723 --> 01:20:30,714
No more tits!

344
01:21:15,470 --> 01:21:16,994
We're here, lnspector.

345
01:21:19,674 --> 01:21:21,665
lnspector, how are you doing?

346
01:21:25,447 --> 01:21:27,574
l must inform you, lnspector...

347
01:21:29,317 --> 01:21:34,687
lnspector, l must inform you
that the girl who was stabbed has just died.

348
01:21:35,123 --> 01:21:36,613
lt's disgusting, Chief.

349
01:21:44,399 --> 01:21:46,867
Attention, headquarters.
Attention, headquarters.

350
01:21:47,035 --> 01:21:49,833
Yes, Officer. We have information.

351
01:21:49,971 --> 01:21:52,462
The suspect has been located
near the Basilica.

352
01:21:56,611 --> 01:21:58,943
Beware, he's likely to be armed.

353
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:30,666
We bring these gifts for you

354
01:23:31,006 --> 01:23:36,808
Oh, father! This is our song

355
01:23:37,278 --> 01:23:43,979
l've tried to live by your light

356
01:23:45,253 --> 01:23:50,316
We love justice and peace

357
01:23:51,593 --> 01:23:55,324
We know you will come
On your feet

358
01:23:55,463 --> 01:23:58,523
We know you will come

359
01:23:59,134 --> 01:24:04,401
