[music playing]



- [sniffling]



- ONE MINUTE, PEOPLE.



- I STILL HAVE TO DO TOUCH-UPS
ON SYLVIA.



- WHAT ARE YOU TELLING ME FOR?



WHERE THE HELL IS SYLVIA?



- HI, IOWA.
HOW NOW, BROWN COW.



- HEY, DALE?



- YEAH, YEAH.
HOW'S IT GOING, JOSH?



- IT'S OKAY.
IT'S OKAY.



LOOK, DALE,
SYLVIA SEEMS TO BE M.I.A.



- WELL,
THAT'S NOT VERY PROFESSIONAL.



- NO, NO, IT'S NOT.



- DAMN UNPROFESSIONAL,
IF YOU ASK ME.



- AND I AGREE.



ANY IDEA WHERE SHE MAY BE?



- NOW, HOW WOULD I KNOW THAT,
JOSH, HMM?



I'M NOT MY WEATHER GIRL'S
KEEPER, RIGHT?



RIGHT?



- YEAH, IT'S JUST THAT
WE'RE ON IN ABOUT 25 SECONDS,



AND I KNOW
YOU AND SHE ARE CLOSE.



SO IF YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHERE SHE MAY BE...



- JOSH, MY PERSONAL LIFE
IS MY BUSINESS.



ARE WE CLEAR ON THAT?



[chuckles]



ARE WE?



- SURE.



MARY!



- I'M GOING NOW.



[sighs]



MS. MILLER?



UM, MS. MILLER,
EVERYBODY'S WAITING,



AND WE'RE ON IN 20 SECONDS.



SHE'S NOT ANSWERING.



I DON'T REALLY--



I GOT HER.



[indistinct conversation]



- JESUS CHRIST, SYLVIA.



- NOT COOL, SYL.



NOT COOL.



- ALL RIGHT, WE GOT HER.



- ALL RIGHT, TEN SECONDS.



- ROLLING AT HER.



[theme music]



<i>- THIS IS SEATTLE MORNING</i>



WITH DALE WATERS,
SHERRY WARREN,



AND SASSY WEATHER GIRL
SYLVIA MILLER.



- COUNT IT OFF.



- FIVE, FOUR...



- THREE, TWO...



- [laughs]



- [giggles]



- OH, WHAT A GREAT MORNING.



- OH, NOT TOO SHABBY,
DALE.



- GOOD MORNING, SEATTLE.



AND GOOD MORNING TO YOU,
SHERRY.



- GOOD MORNING TO YOU, DALE.



- YOU LOOK GREAT THIS MORNING,
SHERRY.



- OH, STOP IT.



YOU'RE MAKING ME BLUSH.



- NO, SERIOUSLY.
- OH.



- YOU LOOK GREAT, SERIOUSLY.



DOESN'T SHE LOOK GREAT?



- COME ON, YOU.



- LET'S SAY HELLO
TO OUR SASSY WEATHER GIRL.



- MMM.



- GOOD MORNING, SYLVIA.



- GOOD MORNING, SYLVIA.



- [laughs sarcastically]



- DID WE LOSE SYLVIA?
- WHAT?



WHAT'S GOING ON?
- SHE'S NOT TALKING.



- THE RAIN IS SURE
COMING DOWN OUT THERE, SYLVIA.



HOW LONG IS IT GONNA
GO ON LIKE THIS?



- FOREVER, DALE.



THIS IS SEATTLE.



IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED,



THE WEATHER HERE SUCKS.



- [chuckles]



- WELL, I THINK
IT'S ROMANTIC, DALE.



- GO TO CAMERA THREE, PLEASE.



- ...A STROLL IN
THE RAIN WITH YOUR SWEETHEART.



- OH, GOD, SHUT UP.



SHUT UP, SHUT UP,
YOU SQUEAKY LITTLE BITCH.



- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.



WE DON'T CALL HER



"OUR SASSY WEATHER GIRL"
FOR NOTHING, FOLKS.



LET'S GO TO A COMMERCIAL.
- OKAY.



- YOU KNOW WHAT, DALE?



BEFORE WE DO THAT,



THERE IS SOMETHING
THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE



WITH OUR VIEWING AUDIENCE.



- WELL, I DON'T THINK THAT'S
SUCH A GREAT IDEA, SYLVIA.



- I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU THINK,
YOU ARROGANT PRICK.



IN FACT, WHY DON'T YOU JUST
SIT THERE



AND LOOK STUPID.



- [laughs]



- WHATEVER YOU DO,
DO NOT CUT.



DO NOT CUT.



- SO THIS IS A LITTLE SEGMENT
THAT I LIKE TO CALL



<i>"BEHIND THE SCENES
OF SEATTLE MORNING."</i>



- OH, MY GOD.



- MANY OF YOU MAY NOT KNOW,



BUT FROM THE MOMENT
THAT I STARTED WORKING HERE,



OUR SEEMINGLY CHARMING COHOST
DALE WATERS



HAS BEEN ALL OVER ME
LIKE A CHEAP SUIT.



DAY AFTER DAY,



AS I STOOD IN FRONT
OF THIS STUPID MAP



REPEATEDLY TRYING
TO FIND NEW ADJECTIVES



TO DESCRIBE THE WORD "RAIN"...



- WHAT DO I DO?



- I'VE BEEN FIGHTING OFF
THE INFANTILE



AND OFTEN OFFENSIVE ADVANCES
OF THAT GUY.



THAT'S RIGHT, LADIES.
HE'S GRABBY.



- GO TO DALE.



- BUT YOU KNOW,
FOR A PLETHORA OF REASONS,



NOT THE LEAST OF WHICH BEING
I AM 35, SINGLE,



AND, UM, YEAH,
OCCASIONALLY LONELY,



I GAVE IN TO HIS ADVANCES.



AND WE HAD SEVERAL, YOU KNOW,



WHAT COULD ONLY BE DESCRIBED
AS DISAPPOINTING ENCOUNTERS.



SORRY.



BUT DESPITE THE AMATEURISH SEX,



I SOMEHOW DEVELOPED
AN ATTACHMENT



TO THE WALKING HAIRCUT
SITTING IN THAT CHAIR.



WE MOVED IN TOGETHER



AND BEGAN TO SHARE A BORING,
STAGNANT, PASSIONLESS LIFE.



- WHAT THE HELL IS SHE DOING?



GEORGE, HELP ME.



CUT THE LIGHTING!
- NO, NO, NO, NO.



DO NOT CUT ANYTHING.
THIS IS GOOD TV.



- SHE HAS LOST HER MIND.



- THAT IS, UNTIL THIS MORNING,



WHEN AFTER DALE HAD ALREADY
LEFT FOR THE STUDIO,



I FOUND THESE.



THEY'RE NOT MINE.



- YOU GO, SYLVIA.



THERE'S OUR EMMY.
THIS IS IT.



- NOW, THESE ARE
A PAIR OF PANTIES



THAT I'VE UNFORTUNATELY
WITNESSED



MY EXHIBITIONIST COHOST WEARING
ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS.



HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN
SLEEPING WITH HIM, SHERRY?



- ALL RIGHT, NUMBER FOUR
TO SHERRY, PLEASE.



- AH, WELL PUT, SHERRY.



WELL, I AM NOW LEAVING
THIS STUPID, MEANINGLESS JOB,



BUT BEFORE I GO,



I JUST WANT TO SAY
TO ALL OF YOU OUT THERE,



FOR THE LOVE OF GOD,
READ A NEWSPAPER.



THIS IS NOT NEWS.



THIS IS FLUFF.



THIS IS TIDBITS FOR DUMB PEOPLE.



- [chuckles]



- [sighs]



ON THAT NOTE,
I WILL SAY GOOD-BYE



<i>TO SEATTLE MORNING,</i>



AND I WILL SEE YOU ALL IN HELL.



- WHAT HAS SHE DONE?



- WOW.
LET'S DO A COMMERCIAL.



- GO TO COMMERCIAL.



- GO TO COMMERCIAL.



- [sighs]



THAT WAS GREAT.



THAT WAS GREAT.



[thunder crashes]



[knock at door]



- [sobbing]



- HMM.



- HEY.



- I KNOW YOU, RIGHT?



WAIT, I KNOW.



AREN'T YOU THAT WEATHER GIRL



WHO COMMITTED CAREER SUICIDE
IN A VERY UNSIGHTLY WAY



BEFORE AN AUDIENCE OF THOUSANDS
THIS MORNING?



- OH, GOD.



- OH, SHIT.
OKAY, COME ON.



COME ON IN.
IT'S OKAY.



COME ON.
- OH, OH, GOD.



WHAT DID YOU DO IN HERE?
IT'S--



- YOU WANT ME TO KICK HIS ASS?



- YES.
- REALLY?



- NO, IT'S--
PLEASE, NO, DON'T KICK HIS ASS.



- ALL RIGHT,
I DON'T THINK I COULD ANYWAY.



YOU WANT A DRINK?



- IT'S 9:00 IN THE MORNING.



YES.



OH.



GOD, OH, WAIT,
CAN I HAVE A BLOODY MARY?



- YEAH, LET ME WHIP THAT UP
FOR YOU.



I'M GOING TO ENJOY
AN APPLE MARTINI.



YOU LOOK LIKE SHIT.



OH, THAT'S GOOD.



- THANK YOU.



- NO, I'M SERIOUS.



YOU--YOU LOOK LIKE SHIT.



THIS IS, LIKE,
YOU LOOK REALLY, REALLY--



THIS IS, LIKE, THE WORST
I'VE EVER SEEN YOU LOOK.



- OKAY, IS THIS SUPPOSED
TO BE HELPING ME?



- SYL, I'M YOUR BROTHER,
AND I'M REALLY VERY FOND OF YOU,



BUT I CANNOT BE OKAY



WITH YOU BEING
THIS MUCH OF A WRECK



OVER THAT DOUCHE BAG
FROM THE MORNING SHOW.



- HEY, CAN I HAVE, LIKE,
FIVE MINUTES HERE?



I'M KIND OF UPSET.



- I'M TRYING TO HELP.



- WELL, YOU CAN HELP
BY SHUTTING UP.



WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE?



- OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?



IF YOU WANT TO GET ALL UPSET
OVER SOME STUPID DUDE



WHO I NEVER LIKED,
THEN GO NUTS.



- I AM WELL AWARE
OF YOUR OPINION, THANK YOU.



- OH, WELL, THEN I GUESS
I DON'T HAVE TO SAY,



"I TOLD YOU SO"



BECAUSE I ALREADY DID,
LIKE, 50 TIMES.



I MEAN, THIS GUY'S AN IDIOT,



AND MY BIG SISTER'S A WRECK
BECAUSE OF HIM.



IT'S EMBARRASSING.



- GOD, YOU ARE SUCH AN IDIOT.



OKAY, IT'S NOT JUST HIM.



IT'S EVERYTHING.



TWO YEARS, WE WERE TOGETHER.



OKAY, TWO YEARS.



WE--WE LIVED TOGETHER.



WE BOUGHT FURNITURE TOGETHER.



WE TALKED ABOUT KIDS' NAMES.



AND WHERE AM I NOW?



I--



I'M 35 YEARS OLD.



I HAVE NO JOB,
NO INSURANCE,



NO APARTMENT,



$1,500 IN A SAVINGS ACCOUNT,



A CAR THAT I COULDN'T AFFORD
PAYMENTS ON WHEN I WAS EMPLOYED,



AND, UM, WHAT ELSE DON'T I HAVE?



OH, YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE
I DON'T HAVE?



I DON'T HAVE A BOYFRIEND.



- TELL ME ABOUT
THIS SAVINGS ACCOUNT.



- I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.



WHAT I'M GOING TO DO?



IT'S LIKE I'M STARTING
ALL OVER AGAIN.



OH, MY GOD.



I HAVE TO START ALL OVER AGAIN.



OH, GOD,
I'M SUCH AN IDIOT.



WHY DIDN'T I STICK AROUND?



I COULD HAVE HUNG AROUND
AND GOTTEN A JOB



OR LOOKED FOR AN APARTMENT
OR SOMETHING.



- YEAH, THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.



JUST HANG OUT AND PRETEND
THAT YOU DON'T KNOW



DALE'S DOING HIS COHOST,
A MUCH BETTER OPTION.



- I'M JUST TRYING
TO BE RATIONAL.



- GOD, YOU'RE SO FULL OF SHIT.



LET ME JUST SHARE WITH YOU
ONE OF YOUR QUALITIES.



ALL RIGHT?



YOU COULDN'T BE RATIONAL



AT THE COST OF YOUR PRIDE
FOR ANYTHING.



YOU DID JUST
WHAT YOU SHOULD HAVE DONE



AND ALSO CONVENIENTLY
WHAT YOU HAD TO DO



BECAUSE OF YOUR LOVE
OF CONFLICT.



- I DON'T LOVE CONFLICT.



- IT'S YOUR CRACK.



NOW, SHUT UP.



YOU'RE GOING TO STAY HERE.



YOU'RE GOING TO GET A JOB,



AND EVERYTHING'S
GOING TO BE OKAY, OKAY?



- YOU THINK SO?



- YEAH, WHY NOT?



- OKAY.



- WELL, I THINK WE SHOULD
CUT HIS BALLS OFF.



- CAN YOU SAY THAT
ANY LOUDER?



- OH, I'M SORRY.



AM I EMBARRASSING YOU?



I WAS TRYING TO BE SUPPORTIVE
OF MY FRIEND.



- ARE YOU SAYING I'M NOT?



- I'M SAYING THAT MAYBE



MAKING PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE
COMMENTS



AND TRYING TO UNDERMINE ME
LIKE YOU ALWAYS DO



IS NOT THE BEST WAY
TO HELP SYLVIA.



- I UNDERMINE YOU?



WHEN HAVE I EVER UNDERMINE--



- I DON'T KNOW WHY I'M HERE.



I DON'T FEEL
LIKE BEING OUT TONIGHT.



WHY DID I GO OUT TONIGHT?



I SHOULD BE AT HOME.



I SHOULD BE AT HOME,
SITTING ON THE COUCH,



EATING ICE CREAM, AND WATCHING
OLD MOVIES OR SOMETHING.



- WHAT YOU NEED IS A COCKTAIL
AND YOUR GIRLFRIENDS.



- YES.



- HEY, WEATHER GIRL.
- HI.



- DALE IS SUCH AN ASSHOLE.



YOU GO, GIRL.



- WHO SAYS, "YOU GO, GIRL"?



- OKAY, YEAH, NO,
I NEED ANOTHER DRINK.



- HONEY, LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING.



I AM SO PROUD
OF WHAT YOU DID TODAY.



- YEAH, ME TOO.



- YOU DID EXACTLY
WHAT I WOULD HAVE DONE.



- ME TOO.



- GAVE IT TO HIM
IN FRONT OF EVERYONE.



- AND THE BITCH.
- THE MOUSY BITCH.



- THERE IS NO WAY THAT FRAIL
LITTLE BITCH IS GOOD IN BED.



NO WAY.



- WELL, THANKS, YOU GUYS.



YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T PLAN IT.



IT JUST SORT OF--
BLAH, HAPPENED.



- SO WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO NOW, LOVE?



- UH, SEND OUT MY RESUME,
I GUESS.



- OH, A WEATHER GIRL RESUME?



WHAT?
SHE'S A WEATHER GIRL.



- I'M A BROADCAST JOURNALIST,
JANE.



- JESUS, JANE,
SHE'S A BROADCAST JOURNALIST.



WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?



- I MADE A MISTAKE.



- LOOK, THERE ARE FOUR OTHER
LOCAL NEWS STATIONS



WITH MORNING, AFTERNOON,



AND NIGHTTIME NEWS PROGRAMS,
RIGHT?



SO THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING
OUT THERE, I THINK.



- MM.
- MM-HMM.



- OH, INCOMING.



- HI.
- HI.



- EXCUSE ME FOR INTERRUPTING.



MY FRIENDS AND I OVER THERE,
WE HAD A BET.



ARE YOU THAT CHICK



THAT TOTALLY LOST HER SHIT
ON THAT NEWS GUY?



[bottle fizzes]



- [gasps]



JESUS CHRIST.



- NO, BYRON, ACTUALLY.



- WHO ARE YOU?



- I'M BYRON.



- AND WHY ARE YOU HERE?



- I'M A FRIEND OF WALT'S.



- WHAT?



WHA-WHA-WHAT IS THAT?



- OH, THAT'S YOU, ACTUALLY.



- WHAT AM I...



WHAT AM I DOING
ON THE COMPUTER?



- UH, YOU'RE FREAKING OUT.



HERE, IT'S ACTUALLY
MY FAVORITE PART.



- BUT DESPITE
THE AMATEURISH SEX,



I SOMEHOW DEVELOPED
AN ATTACHMENT



TO THE WALKING HAIRCUT
SITTING IN THAT CHAIR.



- [chuckles]



I'M SORRY.



I LOVE IT WHEN YOU CALL HIM
A HAIRCUT.



I DON'T KNOW WHY.



- WHY--WHY AM I ON THERE?



- YOU'RE EVERYWHERE.



YOU'RE ON A BUNCH
OF FILM SITES.



I MEAN, JUST ALONE TODAY



I'VE GOTTEN TEN EMAILS
FROM PEOPLE,



AND ONLY ONE OF THEM
WAS FROM WALT.



- WAIT, WALT SENT THIS TO YOU?



- YEAH, WALT AND OTHERS.



[door clicks open]



HEY, WALT.



- HEY.



- HEY, WALT.



- HEY.



WHAT?



I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.



HEY!
OW!



WHAT--



- GET IN THERE.



- WHAT ARE YOU--WHY ARE YOU
TUGGING ON ME?



- I AM ON THE INTERNET.



- WELL, YEAH.



IT WAS A PRETTY FUNNY BREAKDOWN.



PEOPLE LIKE SEEING OTHERS
LOSE IT.



- I DID NOT LOSE IT.



- OKAY.



- AND WHO IS THIS PERSON?



- BYRON.



- BYRON, OKAY, WELL,



I DON'T THINK THAT BYRON
SHOULD BE HERE RIGHT NOW.



I'M KIND OF IN A DELICATE STATE.



[knocking at door]



OH, MY GOD.
- YO.



HEY, UH,
YOU BROUGHT THE BEER IN HERE?



- OH, SHIT, SORRY.



LOOK, I DON'T GET IT.



YOU JUST WENT OUT
WITH ALL YOUR FRIENDS.



NOW YOU'RE ALL TOO DISTRAUGHT
FOR VISITORS?



- EXCUSE ME.



HI, WE ARE KIND OF
IN THE MIDDLE OF SOMETHING HERE.



A LITTLE PRIVATE, SO...



- DID YOU REALLY
SLEEP WITH THAT DALE GUY?



I MEAN,
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?



- I KNOW, RIGHT?



- YOU'RE WAY TOO HOT FOR HIM.



- WHO IS THIS PERSON?



- BYRON.
WHAT...?



- BYRON.



IT'S JUST AN OPINION.



UM, DO YOU GUYS WANT
THIS DOOR CLOSED?



OKAY.
- THANK YOU.



- YEAH--



- REALLY?



- OKAY, LOOK,
I KNOW YOU'VE HAD A ROUGH DAY.



I'M SORRY,
BUT STOP BEING A BITCH, OKAY?



THIS IS MY PLACE,
AND THAT'S MY FRIEND,



AND WE'RE GOING TO HANG OUT
AND PLAY SOME MUSIC.



YOU WANT TO HANG OUT?
RAD.



YOU DON'T, THERE'S A COFFEE SHOP
DOWN THE STREET.



MY HOUSE, MY RULES, MISSY.

HOW CALLOUS YOU'RE BEING.



- [sighs]



YES, YOU CAN.



OH.

- TURN THAT LIGHT OFF.



- YOU SCARED THE SHIT OUT OF ME.



WHAT ARE YOU DOING?



- I'M TRYING TO SLEEP.



- NO, I'M SLEEPING IN HERE.



YOU'RE SLEEPING ON THE COUCH.



- ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?



THIS IS MY BED.



- WELL, I'M NOT SLEEPING
IN HERE WITH YOU.



- WHY NOT?



- BECAUSE IT'S GROSS.



BECAUSE YOU'RE MY BROTHER.



AND I DON'T WANT YOU
ROLLING OVER HERE



IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
AND TOUCHING ME.



IT'S DISTURBING.



- OH, WELL, I'M SORRY
YOU FIND ME SO REPULSIVE.



THERE'S A SLEEPING BAG
IN THE CLOSET.



- LISTEN TO ME.



I'VE HAD A REALLY,
REALLY SHITTY DAY, OKAY?



AND I HAVEN'T BEEN SLEEPING
AT ALL



BECAUSE YOU AND CREEPY
HAVE BEEN PLAYING



IN YOUR LITTLE BAND--



- JAMMING!



- OH, MY GOD, OKAY.
JAMMING.



- WHOA, NO,
DON'T--DON'T--DON'T--



DON'T CONDESCEND TO ME, SYL.



DON'T CALL IT "A LITTLE BAND."



- WHY ARE YOU BEING
SUCH A DICK?



I JUST WANT TO GET SOME SLEEP.



- OH, MY GOD, I'M NOT SLEEPING
ON THE COUCH



'CAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO SHARE
THE BED WITH ME.



- FINE, I'M GONNA
SLEEP ON THE COUCH.



- FINE BY ME.



- FINE.



- OH, WHAT?
NO, NO.



NOT COOL.



NO.



AH, YOU ASSHOLE.



- I'LL TAKE THAT.



- OW!



[car horns honking]



- OH, GOD.



OH!



GOD!



[groans]



- WOW.
- OOH?



- YOU COULDN'T DO THAT AGAIN
IN A MILLION YEARS.



- OW, OW, OW.



- OUCH, OW.



YEAH, THAT SMARTS WHEN
YOU HIT YOUR KNEE LIKE THAT.



- DON'T YOU HAVE A HOME?



- YEAH, I LIVE ACROSS THE HALL.



- DON'T YOU SLEEP?



- NOT MUCH.



- OKAY, WHY ARE YOU HERE?



- I BUILD WEBSITES.



MY COMPUTER IS BUSTED.



SO I TOLD WALT THAT
IF HE LET ME USE HIS,



I'LL GIVE HIM A CUT
OF THE PROFITS.



IT'S KIND OF
A WIN-WIN SITUATION.



BROUGHT YOU A COFFEE.



- WELL, DO YOU HAVE TO BE HERE
ALL THE TIME?



- YEAH, I HAVE A STRONG
WORK ETHIC.



IT'S A VANILLA LATTE.



YOU STRIKE ME LIKE
A VANILLA LATTE TYPE.



- AREN'T YOU INSIGHTFUL.



THANK YOU.



- SO DO YOU WANT TO GO OUT
WITH ME SOMETIME?



- [coughs]
SORRY.



- TOO SOON?



- UM, YES.



UM, YEAH, I'VE BEEN SINGLE
FOR 26 HOURS.



SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT TOO SOON.



- WELL, THE OFFER
IS ON THE TABLE.



- OKAY.



- SO WHAT'S NEXT FOR YOU?



- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?



- WHAT DO I MEAN?



I MEAN, ARE YOU GONNA GET
ANOTHER JOB?



YOU KNOW, A TV JOB
OR SOMETHING ELSE,



AND WHAT ABOUT A PLACE?



I MEAN, ARE YOU GONNA
FIND YOUR OWN PLACE EVENTUALLY?



'CAUSE LET'S FACE IT.



YOUR BROTHER'S GREAT,
BUT HE'S A LITTLE BIT MESSY.



HOW LONG CAN YOU
LIVE WITH HIM, RIGHT?



AND THEN, WHAT ABOUT YOUR STUFF?



YOU GOT ALL THAT STUFF
AT YOUR EX-BOYFRIEND'S PLACE.



THE HAIRCUT, I MEAN,
YOU GONNA LET HIM KEEP IT?



WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO WITH IT?



YOU GONNA MOVE IT INTO STORAGE,



OR ARE YOU GONNA
MOVE IT IN HERE?



ALTHOUGH, I HAVE NO IDEA
WHERE YOU'D PUT IT.



IT'S PRETTY CRAMMED.



AND THEN YOU'VE GOT
YOUR WARDROBE,



GOT THESE POWER SUIT
WEATHER GIRL THINGS.



YOU'RE GONNA NEED TO PROBABLY
DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT--



- OKAY,
YOU HAVE TO STOP TALKING.



YOU'RE MAKING MY HEAD HURT.



- YOU HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT
THIS STUFF.



- NO, I HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT
THIS STUFF.



SO I DON'T NEED YOU TALKING
ABOUT ALL THE THINGS



THAT I HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT



BECAUSE I HAVEN'T
THOUGHT ABOUT THEM YET.



- I'M SORRY.



- I JUST WOKE UP HERE.
- I KNOW.



- AND YOU'RE FREAKING ME OUT.



- DIDN'T MEAN TO.



- WELL, YOU DID.



- YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE REALLY ATTRACTIVE



WHEN YOU GET ALL RILED UP.



- WILL YOU STOP
FLIRTING WITH ME?



- OKAY, BUT YOU MIGHT WANT
TO PUT SOME PANTS ON,



BECAUSE I CAN'T BE HELD
RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT I'M SAYING



WHEN YOU'RE NOT WEARING
ANY PANTS.



IT'S JUST DISTRACTING.



- GOD.



- THE KNEESOCKS, THOUGH,
I LOVE IT.



- OKAY.



SITUATION: NOT GOOD.



YOU NEED TO FIX THIS
IMMEDIATELY.



YOU ARE A SMART, CAPABLE WOMAN.



AND WHAT YOU NEED--
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT YOU NEED?



YOU NEED TO MAKE A LIST.



YOU NEED TO MAKE
A LIST OF PRIORITIES



ON HOW TO GET YOUR LIFE
TOGETHER.



YOU CAN DO THIS.



YOU ARE STRONG.



YOU NEED SOMETHING
TO WRITE ON.



OKAY, I NEED SOME POST-IT NOTES.



WHAT?



WHAT?
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?



DO I HAVE SOMETHING
ON MY FACE?



- SIS, ARE YOU FAMILIAR
WITH A DEVICE CALLED A DVR?



- THIS ISN'T A GOOD IDEA.



- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
LIKE, TIVO?



- TIVO.



- I WOULD BACK OFF.
SHE'S FRAGILE.



- WE CAN DIGITALLY RECORD
A PROGRAM



AND THEN WATCH IT
AT OUR CONVENIENCE.



<i>NOW, I'VE DONE EXACTLY THAT
WITH TODAY'S SEATTLE MORNING.</i>



- WHY?
- FALLOUT.



- WE THOUGHT THERE MIGHT
BE SOME FALLOUT.



- YEAH, I KNOW.



- YOU MAY WANT TO SIT DOWN HERE.



- OH, MY GOD.
- BYRON.



- NO, NO-NO-NO.
I DON'T WANT TO DO IT.



- YOU MUST.



- GO, BYRON, GO.



- AND NOW I FEEL
WE OWE OUR VIEWERS AN APOLOGY.



- WELL, I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT,
DALE.



<i>- YESTERDAY, ONE OF OUR
SEATTLE MORNING TEAM MEMBERS</i>



HAD A BIT OF A, WELL,



I GUESS YOU COULD CALL IT
AN EPISODE.



- AN EPISODE.
SHE DID.



- OH, I DON'T LIKE HER AT ALL.



- SHE MADE A SPECTACLE
OF HERSELF.



SHE TALKED ABOUT THINGS



THAT ARE A BIT OF A NO-NO
ON MORNING TELEVISION,



AND SHE USED SOME
TERRIBLE LANGUAGE.



- WELL, WE HAVE KIDS WATCHING.



- IT'S A MORNING SHOW.



FAMILIES WATCH US.



THEY TRUST US.



WE LET THEM DOWN.



- WE SURE DID.



- OH, STOP IT.
- SORRY.



- SHE ALSO MADE SOME PRETTY
TERRIBLE ACCUSATIONS



AGAINST YOU, DALE.



- AH, YEAH, SHE DID.
SHE DID.



IT'S TRUE,
BUT I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF.



THOSE KIDS OUT THERE,



THEY CAN'T TAKE CARE
OF THEMSELVES YET,



AND THAT'S WHERE WE
FAILED THEM.



- OH, MY GOD.



- I'M NOT GOING TO SIT HERE
AND DEFEND MYSELF,



MY MANHOOD,
AGAINST SOMEONE WHO...



- AND HERE HE GOES.



- TO SAY THE LEAST,
IS FRANKLY UNSTABLE.



- I WOULD SAY THAT.
I WOULD SAY THAT.



WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?



<i>I THINK THAT I SPEAK
FOR ALL OF SEATTLE MORNING</i>



WHEN I SAY,
GOOD FOR YOU, DALE.



GOOD FOR YOU.



- THANKS, SHERRY.



YOU OUT THERE,
OUR FRIENDS,



OUR NEIGHBORS,



WE'RE SORRY, SEATTLE.



WE HOPE THAT WE HAVEN'T
LOST YOUR TRUST.



- OH, SEATTLE.



- THE END.



[jazzy percussive music]



¶¶ ¶¶



- THINK HE'S HOME?



- OH, I KNOW HE'S HOME.



IT'S TIME FOR
HIS AFTER-SHOW NAP.



- OKAY, YOUR SISTER
IS SO HOT.



- DUDE.



THIS PLACE IS GAY.



UP AND AT 'EM, DICKHEAD.



- OH, MY GOD!



- WHOA, WHOA, SYLVIA.



WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?



- WHAT IS SHE DOING HERE?



- OH, YOU GUYS ARE ALREADY
NAPPING TOGETHER.



THAT IS SO PRECIOUS.



- HI, ASSHOLE.



- WOW,
THIS IS A GREAT APARTMENT.



- OH, IT'S NOT AN APARTMENT.



IT'S A CONDO.



- OH, MY GOD.
THEY'RE GONNA KILL US.



- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.



WE'RE ALL PART
OF AN ELITE HIT SQUAD.



- I'M WALT,
SYLVIA'S BROTHER.



REMEMBER ME?



WE'VE MET MAYBE TEN TIMES.



- YEAH, I DO.



HI, WALT.
HOW ARE YOU?



- HUH.
- I WANT MY THINGS, DALE.



AND I'M GONNA TAKE THEM.



- YOU CAN TAKE YOUR CLOTHES,
SYLVIA,



BUT I WON'T
BE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF.



- OH.
- HMM.



- WHAT DID YOU SAY?



- THAT PROBABLY WASN'T
VERY SMART, DALE.



- YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE
TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF?



- BADLY WORDED, REALLY.
- EXACTLY.



- YOU SON OF A BITCH.



- OH, SHIT!
- [screams]



- TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF?



- SHE'S CRAZY!



- STOP INTERRUPTING, SHERRY.



STOP TALKING.
I DON'T WANT TO HURT YOU.



HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN SLEEPING
AROUND BEHIND MY BACK, DALE?



- THAT'S PRETTY COOL, ACTUALLY.



- HOW MUCH OF A FOOL
DID I LOOK LIKE FOR YOU?



YOU THINK THAT I'M FUCKING
TAKING ADVANTAGE?



- HANDS OFF THE ANCHORPEOPLE.



BE NICE.
PLAY NICE. PLAY NICE.



- WHAT'S UP?



- I AM TAKING EVERYTHING
I EVER SPENT A PENNY ON



OUT OF THIS APARTMENT.



IF YOU TRY TO STOP ME,



I SWEAR TO GOD,
I WILL CLAW YOUR EYES OUT.



DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?



EVERY SINGLE THING.



- WHAT?
THIS IS IT?



- THIS IS ALL YOUR STUFF.



- I THOUGHT I HAD MORE STUFF.



- IT'S KIND OF A HOLLOW VICTORY,
ISN'T IT?



- OKAY, SHUT UP, WALT,
ALL RIGHT?



CAN WE GO, PLEASE?



- SYLVIA.



CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND?



YOU JUST TRIED TO KILL ME
IN THERE.



THE LEAST YOU COULD DO
IS TALK TO ME FOR A MINUTE.



- GO AHEAD, YOU GUYS.



GO.



GO.



- ALL RIGHT.



[grunts]



ON THE KNEES.



- WHAT?



- THIS IS NOT ALL MY FAULT.



- OH, PLEASE.



- NO, "OH, PLEASE" YOU,
SYLVIA.



"OH, PLEASE" YOU.



OKAY.



I MADE LOVE
TO ANOTHER WOMAN.



I BROKE THE RULES.



SORRY.



BUT YOU PUSHED ME TO IT.



- I PUSHED YOU TO IT?



HOW DID--
HOW DID I DO THAT?



- YOU NEVER LOVED ME.



YOU NEVER LET ME IN.



YOU NEVER RESPECTED ME.



I WAS OKAY FOR A TIME,



BUT YOU NEVER STOOPED SO LOW



AS TO REALLY ALLOW YOURSELF
TO HAVE FEELINGS FOR ME.



I'M FLESH AND BLOOD, SYLVIA.



I WANT SOMEONE TO WANT ME
AS MUCH AS I WANT THEM.



YOU'RE COLD,



SYLVIA.



YOU ARE COLD.



AND THAT'S WHY I DID
WHAT I DID.



- SAID HE ONLY SLEPT WITH HER
BECAUSE I DIDN'T LOVE HIM,

I DON'T LIKE CROWDING YOUR LIFE
ANY MORE THAN YOU DO.

JOB IN A CLASS II MARKET.

I'VE GOT THEM TOO.



AND THEY ARE TALL
AND, YOU KNOW, MADE OF STONE.



BUT, UH, SINCE I MET YOU,
SYLVIA,



YOU HAVE TORN DOWN MY WALLS.



- OH.
[stammers]



I DIDN'T MEAN TO.



- YOU KNOW, AND I THINK



I SEE THAT YOURS
ARE TUMBLING AS WELL.



AM I RIGHT?



OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.



LET'S JUST--LET'S JUST GET DOWN
TO BUSINESS, SYLVIA.



I WANT TO FAST-TRACK THIS THING.



I WANT A FAMILY:



A WIFE, TWO KIDS,
A BOY AND A GIRL,



LUCIUS AND ARIEL.



I WANT TO SELL MY TOWNHOUSE
AND GET A REAL HOME,



A HOME WITH A WOMAN'S TOUCH.



- OKAY, NOW YOU'RE JUST
SCARING ME.



- YEAH, THAT'S--
THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.



I'M SAYING, YOU KNOW,
THE FUTURE IS SCARY.



BUT NOT IF YOU'VE GOT
SOMEONE TO HOLD.



OKAY, WHAT I NEED
IS SOMEONE TO COMPLEMENT ME.



I WANT MY FRIENDS
TO LOOK AT MY GIRL



AND SAY, "WHOA, LOOK AT THAT
HOT BABE WITH THE 'C' MAN."



YEAH, YOU KNOW?



- YEAH, YEAH,
YEAH, YOU KNOW,



I THINK WE MIGHT BE LOOKING
FOR DIFFERENT THINGS, CHARLES.



- [chuckles]



LET'S NOT BE COY HERE.



NEITHER ONE OF US ARE KIDS.



I KNOW WHAT I WANT,
AND I'M PUTTING IT OUT THERE.



DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WANT?



- HEY.



- [gasps]



JESUS.



AGAIN?



- SORRY.



GOOD DATE?



- [sighs]



WELL, YEAH, HE DID PROPOSE.



HE'S ALSO PROBABLY THE CREEPIEST
PERSON ON THE PLANET, SO...



- THAT'S SO WEIRD.



I MEAN, IT SEEMED LIKE
YOU GUYS WERE SUCH A GOOD MATCH.



SO DID THE TWO OF YOU DO IT?



- [giggles]



NO.



ALL RIGHT, I AM GOING TO BED.



- I DON'T GET IT.



- GET WHAT?



- I MEAN, I JUST DON'T GET
HOW YOU COULD GO OUT



ON SOME DUMB DATE
WITH SOME DUMB GUY



WHEN IT'S SO CLEAR
THAT I HAVE A THING FOR YOU.



I MEAN, IF YOU WANT TO,
YOU KNOW,



GET MARRIED OR MOVE IN
WITH SOMEONE



THEN YOU'RE PROBABLY
BARKING UP THE WRONG TREE,



BUT I DO THINK
I'M A PRETTY GOOD REBOUND GUY.



- MM, AND YOU ARE OFFERING
YOUR SERVICES TO ME.



- YEAH,
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.



BUT I JUST THINK
THAT I AM EXACTLY WHAT YOU NEED



AT THIS CROSSROADS
IN YOUR LIFE.



- DO YOU?



WOW, YOU'RE REALLY
FOND OF YOURSELF, AREN'T YOU?



- OH, COME ON.
GIVE ME A BREAK.



YOU'RE IN LOVE WITH YOURSELF.



YOU THINK YOU MIGHT BE,



LIKE, THE MOST AWESOME
PERSON EVER.



- OKAY, HOW OLD ARE YOU?



- 30.



NEXT YEAR.



- HMM, OKAY, WELL,



LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING,
30 NEXT YEAR.



YOU DON'T KNOW ME.



YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT ME,



AND YOU CERTAINLY DON'T KNOW
WHAT I NEED IN MY LIFE.



- MM-HMM.



YOU KNOW WHAT I LIKE
ABOUT YOU BEST?



- I DON'T CARE.



- YOU'RE DIFFICULT.



- OH.



- AND YOU'RE VERY SEXY



BUT IN THIS FOREIGN FILM
KIND OF WAY



WITH THE ANGLES
AND THE ATTITUDE.



I DIG IT.



- [sighs]



GO HOME, BYRON.



[door clatters open]



YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T
NOT HAVE A POINT.



- EVERYBODY NEEDS A REBOUND GUY.



- I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
WHY DO I NEED



TO AUDITION MEN FOR IT
WHEN I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I NEED?



- THAT IS EXACTLY MY POINT.



- SOMEBODY WHO'S UNCOMPLICATED,
CONVENIENT,



TOTALLY WRONG FOR ME,
AND SOMEBODY WHO I COULD NEVER



IN, LIKE, A MILLION YEARS
HAVE ANY REAL FEELINGS FOR.



- EXCEPT FOR THE RAVENOUS
ANIMAL ATTRACTION.



- NO OBLIGATIONS.
NO COMPLICATIONS.



NO EXPECTATIONS.



- THAT'S PRETTY MUCH
HOW I LIVE MY LIFE.



SO...



- OKAY, UM,
RAISE YOUR RIGHT HAND.



- RAISE?



OKAY.



- OKAY, REPEAT AFTER ME.



I, BYRON...



- OH, WOW, YOU DON'T EVEN
KNOW MY LAST NAME?



OKAY, THAT'S GREAT.



- I, BYRON, PROMISE TO NEVER
FALL IN LOVE WITH SYLVIA,



NO MATTER HOW AWESOME
SHE MAY BE.



- I, BYRON, PROMISE THAT
IF ONE OF US BREAKS THIS DEAL,



IT'S NOT GONNA BE ME.



- OH, IT'S NOT GONNA BE ME.



- YES, IT IS.
- NO, IT'S NOT.



- YEP.



- OKAY, YOU GONNA KISS ME,
OR YOU GONNA BE CLEVER?



- I'M GOING TO KISS YOU.



- OKAY, SOON, YOU THINK?

UNCOMFORTABLE.

- LET ME TAKE THIS OFF.



[cabinet thuds]



[objects clattering]



WHEN DID I START WANTING YOU?



- MY GUESS IS THAT YOU PROBABLY
ALWAYS WANTED ME



AND THAT YOU JUST FORGOT.



- I DON'T REALLY THINK SO.



- IT'S JUST AT THEORY, REALLY.



YEAH, THERE.



UNBUTTON, UNBUTTON.



- I CAN'T.
HELP ME.

THAT'S ANOTHER CONDITION.



YOU CAN'T TELL WALT.



- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?



YOU WANT ME TO LIE
TO MY BEST FRIEND?



I CAN'T, NO, COME ON.



- WHAT?
NO, I'M LYING TO MY BROTHER.



- TOTALLY, TOTALLY
NOT THE SAME THING AT ALL.



NO, NO, I'M SORRY.



I CAN'T DO THAT.



I'M SORRY.



- OKAY.



- WHAT?



- OKAY.



THAT'S A SHAME.



- YEAH.



THIS COULD HAVE BEEN FUN.

- PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN.



- I THINK SO, YEAH.



- [sighs]



WELL, UH, I HOPE THINGS
DON'T GET WEIRD AFTER THIS.



- WELL, NOTHING HAPPENED,
SO...



- YEAH, I'M SURE.



YEAH, EXCEPT THAT,
BUT WHATEVER.



- YEAH.



- YEAH, SWEET DREAMS.



- OKAY.



- NOT TELLING HIM
ISN'T NECESSARILY LYING.



- IT'S LIKE AN OMISSION.



- TOTALLY DIFFERENT THING.
- TOTALLY DIFFERENT.



- COME HERE.



- ¶¶ DIT, DIT, DITTY
NOW HIT AND RUN ¶¶



¶¶ YOU CAN DIT, DIT, DITTY
UNTIL I'M DONE ¶¶



¶¶ COME ALONG DIT, DITTY ¶¶

AN ABUNDANCE OF FRIENDS.



ALL RIGHT, SO IF YOU FUCK UP
MY ONLY FRIENDSHIP,



I'M GOING TO BE PISSED.



- NO FRIENDSHIPS ARE GETTING
RUINED, OKAY?



IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.



- AND YOU, WHAT EXACTLY ARE YOUR
INTENTIONS TOWARD MY SISTER?



'CAUSE IF YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED,



SHE'S KIND OF
IN A VULNERABLE PLACE.



- OH, MY GOD, WALT.



- OKAY, MY INTENTIONS
ARE HONORABLE.



- THERE ARE NO INTENTIONS.



WE'RE JUST MESSING AROUND.



THERE IS NO COMMITMENT,
NO EMOTIONS.



WE'RE JUST TWO FRIENDS
WHO ARE SLEEPING TOGETHER.



- [clears throat]



RIGHT.



- YEAH, THAT ALWAYS WORKS.



GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.



- PAUL.



JUAN.



AH, SYLVIA.



<i>- PUTOS IMPUESTOS.</i>



<i>LA PINCHE MISERIA QUE ME PAGAS,
¿Y LUEGO ME QUITAS LA MITAD?</i>



<i>VAYANSE AL PINCHE DIABLO.</i>



- WHAT DID HE SAY?



- UH, HE'S JUST UPSET
ABOUT THE TAXES.



- YEAH, WELL,
THAT'S THE PRICE YOU PAY



FOR LIVING IN THE BEST DAMN
COUNTRY IN THE WORLD, AMIGO.



<i>- ERES UNA RATA SUCIA,
HIJA DE LA CHINGADA.</i>



- WHAT?
WHAT IS HE SAYING?



- SON OF A BITCH.
WHAT?



I CAN'T LIVE OFF OF THIS.



- WELL, MAYBE YOU SHOULD PICK UP



A COUPLE MORE SHIFTS,
PRINCESS, HUH?



YOU GOT A ONE TOP OUT THERE.



- WAIT, NO, WE'RE CLOSED.



J.D., JUAN ALREADY
SHUT DOWN THE GRILL.



- WE ARE OPEN
TILL I SAY WE'RE CLOSED.



OKAY, AND WE ARE STILL OPEN.



GET YOUR ONE TOP.



<i>- LA ODIO.</i>



<i>- ESA, ESA NO TIENE MADRE.</i>



- YES, THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT IT IS.

- HEY.



- HEY.



WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?



- WELL, FIRST OF ALL...



- FLOWER FOR ME.



- YEAH, I PICKED THEM MYSELF.



- FROM THE VASE ON THE TABLE.



- NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT.



SO LISTEN, YOU WANT TO GO
ON A DATE WITH ME?



- A DATE WITH YOU.



- A DATE WITH ME.



- WELL, YOU KNOW, I STILL HAVE
TO DO MY SIDE WORK AND STUFF,



AND I'M KIND OF TIRED.



- OH, YEAH, NO.



I'M SORRY.



SIDE WORK, OF COURSE.



OKAY, IN THAT CASE,



THEN I'M GOING TO START
WITH THE CHEESE STICKS.



I HEAR THEY'RE
REALLY GREAT HERE.



AND THEN MAYBE JUST
A FILET MIGNON, NO ONIONS,



WELL-DONE.



YOU KNOW, I REALLY LIKE
TO SLOW COOK IT, THE JUICE.



AND THEN FOR DESSERT,
YOU KNOW,



I'M GONNA HOLD OFF ON DESSERT.



SEE HOW I FEEL AFTERWARDS.



PROBABLY GONNA BE A BRULEE,
BUT I DON'T KNOW.



IT MIGHT BE A BAKED ALASKA
AT THIS POINT.



SUZETTE, WOW, I DON'T KNOW.



WE'LL FIGURE THAT OUT AFTER.



OR YOU COULD JUST
GO ON A DATE WITH ME.



- YEAH, LET'S DO THAT.



- OKAY.
- OKAY.



- I'LL WAIT HERE.



- OKAY.



[acoustic guitar music]



- YEAH, BUT WHAT I LOVE TO DO



IS IMAGINE
THE TWO OF YOU AS KIDS.



- OH, YEAH?



AND HOW DOES THAT WORK OUT?



- WELL, IT'S PRETTY FUNNY
ACTUALLY,



BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
YOU, YOU'RE VERY CUTE,



BUT YOU'VE GOT THIS VICIOUS
MEAN STREAK.



- MEAN STREAK?



- OH, YEAH, TOTALLY MEAN.



YEAH, MESSING WITH THE TOYS.



YOU GOT THE--YOU'RE STILL CUTE.



YOU GOT THE PIGTAILS.



- WHAT ABOUT WALT?



HE'S THE MEAN ONE.



- NO, WALT I HAVE TROUBLE
IMAGINING AS A KID.



- OKAY, HE WAS REALLY,
REALLY UGLY,



AND HE HAD THIS HUGE HEAD.



IT WAS LIKE--
HE LOOKED LIKE A WALT PUPPET.



- WELL, I MEAN, HE STILL HAS
A PRETTY BIG HEAD.



YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO SHOW ME
PICTURES OF THAT, THOUGH.



- NO, NO PICTURES.



- OH, COME ON.



YOU CAN'T TEASE ME
WITH THE BIG HEAD



AND THEN NOT GIVE ME
ANY EVIDENCE.



YOU CALL YOUR MOM RIGHT NOW,



AND YOU TELL HER
TO SEND PICTURES DOWN.



I NEED EVIDENCE
OF BIG HEAD STAT.



- OKAY, SO, UH...



THIS IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS
WHERE I'M GOING TO SAY SOMETHING



AND YOU'RE GOING TO FEEL
LIKE AN ASSHOLE,



BUT DON'T FEEL LIKE AN ASSHOLE,
OKAY?



- OKAY.



NO PROMISES.



- MY MOM'S DEAD.



- I AM AN ASSHOLE.



- NO, YOU'RE NOT.



WELL, YOU KNOW,
IT WAS CANCER.



I WAS 14.



- LISTEN, I AM SO SORRY.



- NO, THAT'S OKAY.



I'VE HAD A LOT OF TIME
TO GET USED TO IT.



IT'S FINE.



- WAIT, SO YOUR DAD
RAISED YOU?



- NO, NO.



MY DAD WAS A SON OF A BITCH.



HE DIDN'T RAISE ANYBODY.



HE JUST SORT OF SAT AROUND
ON THE COUCH DRINKING



AND CASHING UNEMPLOYMENT CHECKS.



NO, SO WALT AND I PRETTY MUCH
RAISED OURSELVES.



- HUH.



- YEAH, WEIRD, HUH?



SO WHAT, IS THAT THE,



"HUH, NOW I KNOW
WHY SHE'S SO SCREWED UP?



"DEADBEAT DAD,
DEAD MOTHER.



IT EXPLAINS WHY
SHE'S SUCH A NUT."



- NO.



THAT'S THE, "HUH, I'M WONDERING
WHY MY BEST FRIEND



NEVER TOLD ME
ANY OF THIS STUFF."



- WELL, YOU KNOW, WE DON'T
REALLY TALK ABOUT IT THAT MUCH.



- WELL, JUST FOR THE RECORD,



YOU'RE REALLY NOT THAT
SCREWED UP, LIKE, AT ALL.



SORRY.



- WELL, MAYBE YOU'RE NOT SEEING
THAT CLEARLY.



- MAYBE.



- YOU KNOW, I COULD DRAW
A PICTURE OF THE BIG HEAD.



PROBABLY WOULDN'T
DO IT JUSTICE, THOUGH.



- NO, A DRAWING,
THAT'S GOOD.



YEAH, HAVE THAT ON MY DESK
BY THE MORNING.



- OKAY.



[romantic guitar music]

AWKWARD.

[chuckling]

IT WAS GREAT SEEING YOU.



- OH, SO GOOD.

I'M GLAD THAT WE
RAN INTO YOU HERE OF ALL PLACES.

LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING TO ME.

SO THOSE WERE MY FRIENDS.

[thunder crashes]



AND IT'S RAINING.



- YEAH.



- SO, SYLVIA,



HOW'S IT GOING?



- I AM LIVING THE DREAM, IRVING.



- YEAH, SO WE'VE WORKED TOGETHER
FOR QUITE A WHILE NOW.



- FIVE FUN-FILLED WEEKS.



- I THINK IT'S TIME WE STOP
PLAYING THESE LITTLE GAMES.



- WHAT GAMES ARE WE PLAYING,
IRVING?



- THE ONE WHERE YOU PRETEND
YOU'RE NOT INTO ME.



I PRETEND NOT TO NOTICE
YOUR LUST-FILLED GAZES.



- OH.



- I MEAN, WE'RE BOTH, YOU KNOW,
MATURE, SEXUAL BEINGS.



I SAY IT'S TIME WE STOP
TORTURING OURSELVES



AND YOU KNOW, GIVE INTO
OUR ANIMAL NATURE.



- YEAH, I'M ON MY BREAK,
IRVING.



- I MEAN, SURE, YOU'RE--



YOU'RE A LITTLE BIT OLDER
THAN ANYBODY ELSE HERE,



BUT YOU KNOW,
I'M COOL WITH THAT.



I'M DOWN WITH THAT.



I MEAN, YOU COULD--



- [gagging]



- YOU COULD PROBABLY TEACH ME
SOME SHIT.



- GOD, I AM ON MY BREAK.



- [coughing]



- OKAY, HERE WE GO.
COME ON.



IT'S OKAY.
HERE WE GO.



- THE GUY IS CHOKING.
OH, MY GOD.



- [splutters]



- THERE YOU GO.



OH!



SORRY.



[applause]



- HERE IT IS.



"SASSY WEATHER GIRL
SAVES THE DAY."



- MOVE IT.



- I REALLY HATE
THAT "SASSY" THING.



- LOOK, YOU'RE SASSY.
JUST ACCEPT IT.



- SO SASSY.



- WAIT, DO I LOOK FAT IN THAT?



I THINK I LOOK FAT IN THAT.



- NO, YOU LOOK GREAT.
LOOK AT YOU.



- HELLO, YEAH.



HEY, FAT GIRL.



GO BACK TO THAT PART
WHERE SHE DROPS HIM.



THAT'S MY FAVORITE.



- UM, WHAT?
AT THE END?



- SHIT.



- WHAT?
- I KNEW IT.



YOU LIKE HER.



YOU LIKE HER.



I KNEW THIS WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.



- COME ON, MAN, I TOLD YOU.



I DON'T LIKE HER.



THIS IS A CASUAL THING.



- WHATEVER, MAN.



YOU GONNA TELL HER?



- TELL HER WHAT?



- LOOK, YOU BETTER TELL HER,



'CAUSE SHE'S ROLLED UP
THE WINDOW.



- THE WINDOW?



WHAT ARE YOU EVEN
TALKING ABOUT?



- THE WINDOW IS UP.



AND YOU'RE ON THAT SIDE OF IT.



LOOK, I KNOW HER, MAN.



YOU CAN'T BREAK THROUGH
THE WINDOW.



THAT SHIT'S BULLETPROOF.



SHE HAS TO ROLL IT DOWN.



THE ONLY WAY
SHE'S GOING TO DO THAT



IS IF YOU TELL HER
YOU DIG HER.



- BULLETPROOF, HUH?



- OF COURSE, THE PROBLEM IS,
IF YOU TELL HER YOU DIG HER



AND SHE DOESN'T WANT TO ROLL
DOWN THE WINDOW,



SHE'LL CUT OFF THE SEX.



HAVING A CASUAL RELATIONSHIP



WITH SOMEONE WHO HAS EMOTIONS
IS MESSY, MAN.



- STOP, ALL RIGHT?
I DON'T LIKE HER.



I DON'T WANT HER TO ROLL DOWN
HER WINDOW.



I DON'T EVEN WANT TO GET INTO
HER METAPHORICAL CAR, OKAY?



LEAVE IT ALONE.



- YEAH, THAT'S IT, GOOD.



THAT'S GOOD.



THROW A LITTLE FIT THERE.
GOOD FOR YOU.



YOU KNOW THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
SHE WANTS TO AVOID



BY ROLLING UP THE WINDOW
IN THE FIRST PLACE.



WAY TO FALL INTO HER TRAP.



- YOU--



[door clicks open]



- WHAT?
WHAT'S THE MATTER?



- FIRST OFF, SYLVIA,



I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU
FOR COMING IN THIS MORNING.



I KNOW IT MUST BE A BIT AWKWARD.



- WELL, YEAH, BUT, UH,
COULDN'T STAY AWAY, YOU KNOW?



CURIOSITY AND ALL THAT.



- RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.



SO LET'S GET DOWN
TO BRASS TACKS.



WE HAVE RERUN YOUR LAST SHOW
FOUR TIMES



IN THE SIX WEEKS
YOU'VE BEEN GONE.



AND THE RATINGS HAVE
GOTTEN BETTER EVERY TIME.



IT IS ALL OVER THE INTERNET



AND SO IS THAT VIDEO OF YOU,
BY THE WAY,



SAVING THE MAN FROM CHOKING.



EVERYBODY SEEMS TO KNOW
THE SASSY WEATHER GIRL.



- GOD, YOU'VE GOT TO BE
KIDDING ME.



- NO, NO, NO, WE GET LETTERS,
PHONE CALLS APPLAUDING YOU,



AND--HEY, JOSH!



SHUT THAT OFF.



OUR VIEWERS LOVE YOU
MORE THAN EVER BEFORE.



THEY SAY YOU'VE GOT VERVE.



LET ME HEAR YOU SAY IT.



- VERVE.



- SAY IT LOUDER.
- VER--OKAY.



- THAT'S WHAT YOU GOT, BABE.



AND THAT'S WHAT
THEY WANT TO SEE.



WELL, AND WE'RE
GOING INTO SWEEPS.



- SO WHAT?



YOU WANT ME TO COME BACK
TO MY OLD JOB?



- NO, NO,
NOT YOUR OLD JOB.



NO, YOUR OLD JOB,
YOU POPPED IN EVERY 15 MINUTES.



NO, MMM, WE WANT YOU
TO COANCHOR.



- COANCHOR?



- YOU AND DALE.



- OH, NO, NO.
I CAN'T--



- YES, YES, COME.



YES, YES, NO, SEE?



THAT'S--THAT'S THE HOOK, BABE.



THAT'S WHAT EVERYBODY
WANTS TO SEE:



YOU TWO GOING BACK AND FORTH
GOING AT IT.



AND YOU CAN SAY
ANYTHING YOU WANT.



IN FACT, WE WANT YOU TO.



- WHAT ABOUT THE MOUSY BITCH?



- WHO?



- MOUSY BITCH.



- MM, MM.



THAT MOUSY BITCH.



WELL,
SINCE SHE AND DALE BROKE UP,



SHE'S BECOME INCREASINGLY
DIFFICULT.



IF YOU ASK ME,
BETWEEN YOU AND ME,



I THINK THE HEIFER'S DRINKING.



- REALLY?
- MM.



REALLY.



- HUH.



- ARE YOU COMING BACK?



- DOES THAT IDEA SCARE YOU?



- NO, ACTUALLY,
I SUGGESTED IT.



- REALLY?



- YEAH, YEAH, I MISS YOU.



I KNOW IT SOUNDS CORNY,
BUT I DO.



- WELL, I HAVEN'T GIVEN FITZ
MY ANSWER YET,



BUT SOMEHOW IT DOESN'T SEEM
LIKE THE BEST IDEA EVER.



- WELL, MAYBE WE COULD
GET TOGETHER.



WE COULD TALK.



MAYBE WE COULD HAVE DINNER.



MAYBE I COULD CALM SOME FEARS.



- ARE YOU ASKING ME
ON A DATE?



- IF YOU WANT IT TO BE.



IF NOT,
A DINNER BETWEEN COLLEAGUES,



A BUSINESS DINNER.



- DALE?



DALEY?



OH, OH, LOOKEE HERE.



TWO LOVEBIRDS
REU-FUCKING-NITED.



- SHERRY,
GO BACK IN YOUR DRESSING ROOM.



- OH, SORRY,
FIRST YOU DUMP ME,



AND NOW YOU THINK
YOU CAN TELL ME WHAT TO DO?



WELL, I GOT NEWS FOR YOU,
ASSHOLE.



YOU'RE NOT THE BOSS OF ME.



I'M GOING TO WHAT I WANT TO DO
AND WHEN I WANT IT.



HI, SYLVIA.



- HEY, SHERRY.



- I GUESS YOU THINK
THIS IS KARMA, HUH?



- NO, I DIDN'T--
I DIDN'T THINK THAT.



- THE MOUSY BITCH GETS HERS
IN THE END, AM I RIGHT?



"OH, NO."



MAKES PERFECT SENSE TO ME.



HEY, DALE, YOU WANT TO SEE
MY IMPRESSION OF SYLVIA?



"HI, I'M SYLVIA.



"I HAVE A PSYCHOTIC EPISODE
ON LIVE TELEVISION.



"I USED SOME TERRIBLE,
FOUL LANGUAGE,



"AND I DESCRIBED A SEX ACT
ON A MORNING TV SHOW.



"I'M VERY, VERY MEAN
TO STUPID SHERRY,



"AND I CALL HER
REALLY HURTFUL NAMES



"THAT JUST MIGHT REMIND HER
OF SOME STUFF FROM CHILDHOOD,



"AND THEN WHEN SWEEPS
COMES AROUND,



I TAKE HER JOB."



OH, AND THIS IS MY FAVORITE ONE.



"THE MAN I EMASCULATED IN FRONT
OF MILLIONS OF SEATTLEITES



STARTS WANTING ME BACK."



HOW THE FUCK DOES THAT HAPPEN?



I MEAN, THAT DOESN'T
MAKE ANY SENSE.



UNLESS I'M BEING PUNISHED
BY A GOD.



OH, YOU GUYS THINK
GOD'S MAD AT ME?



- NO, I DOUBT IT.



- OH, SHUT UP!



BULLSHIT!
YOU DON'T KNOW!



SO YOU GUYS ARE GETTING
BACK TOGETHER, HUH?



THAT'S...



[screams]



[head thinks]



MY FACE HURTS.



- WE'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU, MA'AM.



- I LOVE YOU.



CAN YOU GRAB
MY WATER BOTTLE?



- NO, MA'AM.



- BUT IT'S RIGHT THERE.



- NO.



- W-W-WHY?



BUT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ME
TO STAY HYDRATED.



- WELL, I WOULD JUST LIKE
TO CONGRATULATE YOU



ON ANOTHER DRAMATIC ENDING



TO ANOTHER ROMANTIC
RELATIONSHIP.



- WHO'S YOUR MANAGER?



- WELL, AT LEAST THIS TIME



SHE DIDN'T WANT TO KILL ME.



SHE WANTED TO KILL YOU.



- DETAILS.



- I NEED IT!



- YOU NEVER RESPONDED
TO MY DINNER INVITATION.



- YOU'RE DOING WHAT?



- STOP SAYING THAT.



- I'M SORRY.



I'M JUST HAVING A HARD TIME
WITH THE LOGIC HERE.



- THEY ARE OFFERING ME A RAISE,
AND I GET TO COANCHOR.



YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS, WALT?



IT MEANS I GET TO DELIVER
THE NEWS.



REAL NEWS, NOT JUST THE WEATHER.



I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
I STILL HAVE TO DO THE WEATHER,



BUT I GET
TO DO OTHER STUFF TOO NOW.



- ALL OF THAT FOR THE
ROCK-BOTTOM PRICE OF YOUR SOUL.



- WOULD YOU STOP BEING
SO DRAMATIC?



- WILL YOU STOP BEING
SUCH A SELLOUT?



- WALT.



- SYLVIA, THEY FIRED YOU
WITH PREJUDICE.



- THEY DID NOT FIRE ME.



I QUIT.
- OH.



- LOOK, THIS IS A REAL JOB,



ONE WHERE I NEVER HAVE TO TOUCH



DIRTY DISHES OR LEFTOVER FOOD
AGAIN.



AND IF I TAKE IT,
THERE'S A SIGNING BONUS,



WHICH MEANS I GET TO FIND
MY OWN PLACE IMMEDIATELY



AND PAY YOU BACK
ALL THE MONEY I OWE YOU.



- I DON'T WANT YOUR DIRTY MONEY.



I WANT YOU TO HAVE SOME
GODDAMN SELF-RESPECT.



- GOD, YOU ARE SO
SELF-IMPORTANT.



- THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE DOING.



- I WANT A LIFE, WALT, OKAY?



I AM A 35-YEAR-OLD WOMAN,



AND I'M LIVING
LIKE A COLLEGE FRESHMAN.



I HAVE NO MONEY.



I AM WAITING TABLES.



I HAVE A ROOMMATE.



AND I AM SLEEPING WITH
THE GUY ACROSS THE HALL.



DON'T YOU TALK TO ME
ABOUT SELF-RESPECT, WALT.



I'M DOING THIS
BECAUSE I DESERVE BETTER.



- OH, IS THAT WHY
YOU'RE GOING ON A DATE



WITH THE GUY WHO CHEATED ON YOU
AND BROKE YOUR HEART?



- IT IS NOT A DATE.



IT IS A BUSINESS DINNER
WITH A COLLEAGUE.



- SHUT UP!



- AND I THINK "BROKE YOUR HEART"



IS OVERDOING IT A BIT,
DON'T YOU THINK?



- YOU KNOW WHAT?



I'M JUST GOING TO SAY THIS,
AND THEN I'M WALKING.



- OH, I HIGHLY DOUBT THAT.



- OH, I'M WALKING



JUST AS SOON AS I SAY
THIS ONE THING.



YOU READY?
- WHAT?



- YOU READY?
- WHAT?



- MOM WOULD BE REALLY
DISAPPOINTED IN YOU.



THAT'S RIGHT.



I INVOKED MOM.



- MOM WOULD BE REALLY
DISAPPOINTED IN ME?



IS THAT WHAT YOU SAID?



- YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I SAID.



- OH.



WELL, THAT'S INTERESTING, WALT,



CONSIDERING
THAT MOM WORKED



UNTIL SHE COULD BARELY STAND UP
FROM THE PAIN



WHILE OUR FATHER
SAT ON THE COUCH ALL DAY



DOING NOTHING
BUT PASS JUDGMENTS.



WAIT A MINUTE.



WHO ELSE DOES THAT, WALT?



LET ME THINK--UH-OH.



YOU KNOW WHO ELSE DOES THAT?
YOU DO THAT, WALT.



SO WHILE I MAY BE A HUGE
DISAPPOINTMENT TO OUR MOTHER,



I TAKE SOLACE IN THE FACT



THAT WHEREVER
THAT SON OF A BITCH IS,



HE IS PROBABLY REALLY PROUD



OF THE FINE YOUNG MAN
YOU'VE BECOME.



- [scoffs]



OKAY.



OKAY.



YOU DO WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO,
SYLVIA.



[glass shatters]



- SHIT.



- HEY.



- HEY.



- I JUST TALKED TO WALT.



ARE YOU OKAY?



- YEAH.
NO, I'M FINE, THANKS.



IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW.



YOU KNOW ME AND WALT.
WE'RE ALWAYS BICKERING.



- YEAH, THAT DIDN'T SOUND
LIKE BICKERING.



- UM, WELL,
I'M KIND OF RUNNING LATE, SO...



- RIGHT, SO YOU'RE GOING BACK
TO THE MORNING SHOW?



- CONSIDERING IT.



- AND THE GUY?



YOU'RE, UH, YOU'RE GONNA
GO OUT WITH HIM?



- MM-HMM.



- THE HAIRCUT?



- YEAH, I--CAN WE TALK ABOUT
THIS LATER, PLEASE?



- YEAH, WELL, YOU WILL HAVE
ALREADY GONE OUT WITH HIM LATER,



SO THAT TALK WILL BE MOOT.



- BYRON, DON'T ACT LIKE THIS,
OKAY?



- ACT LIKE THIS?



ACT LIKE WHAT?



I'M NOT ACTING.
YOU'RE ACTING.



I'M JUST REACTING HERE.



- WE HAD A DEAL,
REMEMBER?



WE--NO EMOTIONS.



NO COMMITMENT, RIGHT?



WE'RE JUST--
WE'VE BEEN HAVING FUN.



- YEAH, I REMEMBER THE DEAL.



YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME
WHAT THE DEAL IS



'CAUSE I REMEMBER IT, SO...



- SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?



- IT'S NOT A PROBLEM.



THE PROBLEM IS THAT



THAT DEAL WAS MADE,
LIKE, FOREVER AGO.



RIGHT?



I MEAN, THIS WAS BEFORE
WE KNEW EACH OTHER



AND BEFORE WE SPENT
ALL THIS TIME TOGETHER,



AND--AND--AND WE LIKED
EACH OTHER, AND WE HAD FUN,



AND--AND IT WAS BEFORE



I PICKED YOU THAT STUPID FLOWER
OFF THE TABLE.



HEY, HEY.



WE HAVE A GOOD THING HERE.



I LIKE YOU.



I DON'T WANT YOU
TO SEE ANYBODY ELSE.



I JUST--I THOUGHT THAT WE HAD
KIND OF MOVED PAST THE DEAL.



- WELL, UM...



I HAVEN'T FELT THAT--
I HAVEN'T FELT THAT WAY.



- OH, UH, WELL...



THAT'S DIFFERENT.



- LOOK, BYRON, LISTEN, I...



- NO, UM,
I WAS MISTAKEN.



[laughs]



UM, GOD, I JUST--



I FEEL SO NOT COOL
RIGHT NOW.



I SHOULD GO.



- LISTEN TO ME.



BYRON, I--LOOK,
I LIKE YOU A LOT.



I DO.
I JUST--



WE'RE TOO DIFFERENT,
YOU KNOW?



AND I NEED TO BE
WITH A GROWN-UP.



- RIGHT.



SOMEBODY NOT ME.



THAT'S OKAY.



BUT I THINK THAT
WE SHOULD STOP TALKING NOW.



GOOD LUCK ON YOUR DATE, THOUGH.



- SYLVIA?



- YEAH?



- OH, GOD, HI, SORRY.



YES, PLEASE.



[wine splashes]



THANK YOU.



- WHERE ARE YOU?



- I'M HERE.



I JUST, YOU KNOW,
I HAVE A LOT ON MY MIND.



THAT'S ALL.



- YEAH, I'LL BET.



I'LL BET YOU'RE OVERWHELMED.



I KNOW CERTAINLY AM.



- IS THAT RIGHT?



- FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN GIVEN
A SECOND CHANCE AT HAPPINESS.



- WOW, FORGIVE ME
IF I DON'T SWOON.



- [chuckles]



I'M SERIOUS.



I'M VERY SERIOUS.



SHERRY--
SHERRY TAUGHT ME SOMETHING.



SHE BROUGHT PERSPECTIVE.



SHERRY'S, UM,
SHE'S JUST A GIRL.



YOU'RE A WOMAN.



AND YOU'RE THE ONE FOR ME.



- WELL, I'M GLAD DATING



A PSYCHOTIC, OBSESSIVE,
SELF-LOATHING ALCOHOLIC



MADE YOU APPRECIATE
WHAT WE HAD.



- LISTEN, I KNOW THIS, OKAY?



I'M A FOOL.



BUT I'M TRYING TO MAKE IT RIGHT.



- WAIT, NO.



OH, GOD, WHAT AM I DOING?



- YOU'RE RIGHT.



YOU'RE RIGHT.



LET'S TAKE IT SLOW.



I'LL BE HERE
WHEN YOU'RE READY.



I'M NOT GOING TO SCREW IT UP
THIS TIME.



- SHE TOOK THE JOB.



GOT A BIG BONUS.
NEW APARTMENT.



- OKAY.



[acoustic guitar music]

AT YOUR WIT'S END ¶¶



¶¶ BUT I FORCED YOU THERE ¶¶



¶¶ AND THEN HOPED YOU'D
FIND YOUR WAY BACK TO ME ¶¶

- FINALLY GOT PAID.



- YEAH?



OH, THIS IS TOO MUCH.



- NO, IT'S RIGHT.



- SHIT, COOL.



YOU OKAY?



- [groans]



I'M KIND OF HOOKED ON HER, MAN.



- YEAH, I KNOW.



- I JUST DON'T GET IT.



I MEAN, THIS HAS NEVER
HAPPENED TO ME BEFORE.



GIRLS USUALLY LIKE ME.



- SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
ABOUT IT?



- WELL, I'VE STARTED DRINKING
HEAVILY.



WHAT, MAN?



WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?



AM I SUPPOSED TO GO OUT
AND RUN OUT INTO THE RAIN



AND DECLARE MY UNDYING LOVE
AND DEVOTION?



YEAH, WHY DON'T I MAKE IT
JUST A LITTLE MORE AWKWARD?



YOU KNOW WHAT?



SHE KNOWS.



WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO SAY?



YOU KNOW, "HEY, SYLVIA, UM,



I'M INTO YOU."



AND THEN SHE'LL SAY,



"UM, BYRON, I THOUGHT WE
ALREADY TALKED ABOUT THIS.



I TOLD YOU THAT
I'M NOT THAT INTO YOU."



AND THEN I'LL BE, LIKE,
"NO, NO, NO, NO, NO,



"YOU DON'T GET IT.



I'M REALLY, REALLY INTO YOU."



AND THEN SHE'LL BE, LIKE,
"OH, MY GOD.



"I-I TOTALLY DIDN'T EVEN REALIZE
WHAT YOU WERE SAYING BEFORE.



"I WAS SO CONFUSED,
BUT NOW, NOW I GET IT



"BECAUSE NOW THAT YOU'VE TOLD ME



"THAT YOU'RE REALLY,
REALLY INTO ME,



"NOW THAT I HAVE THAT
LITTLE PIECE OF INFORMATION,



"EVERYTHING CHANGES.



"I HAVE ALL THESE FEELINGS
FOR YOU,



"AND ALL OF A SUDDEN,



I AM SO TOTALLY REALLY,
REALLY INTO YOU TOO, WOW."



- WHATEVER.



- NO, "WHATEVER" YOU, DUDE.



WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?



SHE CHOSE THE TOOL, OKAY?



THAT'S WHAT SHE WANTS.



YOU KNOW WHAT?



SHE WANTS THE MONEY
AND THE SECURITY



AND THE GROWN-UPNESS,



AND I DON'T HAVE ANY OF IT,
ALL RIGHT?



AND YOU KNOW THAT.



AND I WISH YOU WOULD STOP
PUSHING ME INTO IT



JUST SO YOU COULD WATCH ME
GO DOWN IN FLAMES.



- YOU KNOW WHAT?



IF YOU DON'T TAKE IT
AS FAR AS YOU CAN GO,



YOU DON'T DESERVE HER.



ALL RIGHT?



DO YOU LOVE HER?



- WHAT DIFFERENCE
DOES THAT MAKE, MAN?



- DO YOU LOVE HER?



DON'T BE A PUSSY,
JUST TELL ME.



DO YOU LOVE HER?



[romantic music]

[knocking at door]



- KNOCK, KNOCK.



- ANOTHER FLOWER.



- OH, YOU LOOK AMAZING.



- THANKS.



I DON'T FEEL IT.



- YEAH, JUST NERVES.



YOU GET LIKE THIS
BEFORE EVERY SHOW.



YOU KNOW THAT,
ALWAYS HAVE.



- YEAH, NO, I KNOW.



YOU'RE RIGHT.



- I KNOW I'M RIGHT.



I'M NOT ALWAYS RIGHT.



ONE THING I DO KNOW IS YOU.



I KNOW YOU.



I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE BACK
IN MY LIFE, SYLVIA.



I LOVE YOU.



YOU KNOW THAT.



- WELL, ISN'T THIS CUTE?



- I'LL SEE YOU OUT THERE, KID.



HEY, WALT.



- DICKHEAD.



- NICE, WALT.
REALLY CLASSY.



- OH, I'M SUPPOSED TO BE NICE
TO HIM NOW?



I MEAN, JUST 'CAUSE YOU'RE
A COMPLETE IDIOT,



I DON'T KNOW WHY I HAVE TO BE.



- GREAT, MY BROTHER'S TRYING
TO PICK A FIGHT WITH ME



MOMENTS BEFORE
I GO ON LIVE TELEVISION.



- GODDAMN RIGHT; YOUR BROTHER
DRAGGED HIS ASS UP AT 5:00 A.M.



SO HE COULD COME TELL YOU
WHAT AN ASSHOLE YOU'RE BEING.



- WALT, DON'T START.



- I'M STARTED, ALL RIGHT?



WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE, HUH?
WHAT?



WHY DID YOU TAKE THIS JOB BACK?



WHY ARE YOU LETTING
THE GUY WHO CHEATED ON YOU



KISS YOUR HEAD?



- GOD, STOP IT.



DON'T EVEN TRY TO BE THE
MORAL AUTHORITY WITH ME, WALT.



I KNOW YOU.
- AND I KNOW YOU.



- SYLVIA, YOU'RE ON
IN TWO MINUTES.



- OKAY.



- LOOK, YOU KNOW, IF YOU REALLY
WANTED DALE THE ASSHOLE,



YOU WOULDN'T BE FEELING
SO GROSS ABOUT ALL THIS.



- GOD, THIS IS MY LIFE HERE,
WALT.



- COME ON.
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE, SYL.



- SYLVIA, I'M SORRY.



WE REALLY NEED YOU.



- YOU KNOW WHAT?



JUST MIND YOUR BUSINESS,
ALL RIGHT?



LOOK, I LOVE YOU,



AND I'M TRYING TO STOP YOU
FROM MAKING A HUGE MISTAKE HERE.



YOU'RE NOT THIS GIRL, OKAY?



YOU DON'T GET BOUGHT OFF
TO RETURN TO A JOB



THAT YOU NEVER LIKED.



YOU DON'T GO BACK WITH THE GUY
WHO CHEATED ON YOU,



AND YOU DON'T LET THE ONE GUY
YOU EVER REALLY CARED ABOUT



GET AWAY BECAUSE HE'S NOT
RICH ENOUGH.



THAT'S NOT YOU.



THAT'S--
THAT'S SASSY WEATHER GIRL.



I HATE HER,
AND--AND SO DO YOU.



AND HEY, I'M--



I'M SORRY I SAID THAT THING
ABOUT MOM.



YOU KNOW, IT'S--
IT'S NOT TRUE.



- NO, I KNOW.



AND YOU'RE NOT LIKE DAD
AT ALL.



I DON'T--
IT WAS JUST MEAN.



SORRY.



- THANKS.



[mellow music]



¶¶ ¶¶



- I GOT HER.



- OKAY.



- CUTTING IT A LITTLE CLOSE,
AREN'T WE?



- MAKEUP, CLEAR.
GET OUT OF THERE.



CLEAR FRAME.
SHE'S FINE.



COME ON.



- HERE WE GO.
- HERE WE GO.



- ROLLING HEADER.



<i>- WELCOME TO THE ALL-NEW
SEATTLE MORNING</i>



WITH YOUR HOSTS,
DALE WATERS



AND SASSY SYLVIA MILLER.



RISE AND SHINE



AND GET READY
FOR THE SPARKS TO FLY.



- ALL CAMERAS READY?



- GETTING READY
TO DO COUNTDOWN.



- FOUR, THREE--



- REMEMBER,
DON'T STEP ON ME.



[laughs]



GOOD MORNING, SEATTLE.



I AM SO GLAD YOU TUNED IN TODAY,



BECAUSE WE HAVE A VERY,
VERY SPECIAL SHOW.



TODAY WE WELCOME BACK



<i>A MEMBER OF
OUR SEATTLE MORNING FAMILY</i>



AND SOMEONE VERY SPECIAL TO ME.



AND EVEN THOUGH I'M PROBABLY
IN FOR IT,



WE ARE SO GLAD
TO HAVE YOU BACK, SYLVIA.



GO AHEAD, SYLVIA.



COME ON.



HIT ME WITH THAT
ACIDIC TONGUE OF YOURS.



I CAN TAKE IT.



WHAT?



CAT GOT YOUR TONGUE?



[meows]



BOY, THAT'S A FIRST.



OKAY, LOOK,
WHY DON'T WE TAKE A BREAK.



WE'LL GO TO COMMERCIAL,
COME RIGHT BACK,



AND WE'LL BE RIGHT HERE--



<i>- YOU KNOW, DALE, RETURNING TO
SEATTLE MORNING</i>



IS RATHER BITTERSWEET.



- REALLY?



- REALLY, DALE.



I MEAN, ON THE ONE HAND,



I GET TO RETURN TO
A DEMEANING POSITION



WHERE MY JOB IS TO GIGGLE
AND LOOK ATTRACTIVE



AND TRIVIALIZE THE DAY'S NEWS.



ON THE OTHER HAND,



I GET TO SIT NEXT TO
A SELF-IMPORTANT PRICK



WHO BELIEVES HIMSELF
TO BE GOD'S GIFT TO WOMEN.



I'M REFERRING TO YOU, DALE.



- I FIGURED.



- OKAY, I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR.



SO LET ME JUST SET YOU
AND THE STATION



AND OUR VIEWING AUDIENCE
STRAIGHT ON A FEW THINGS.



FIRST OF ALL, MY TITLE,
"SASSY WEATHER GIRL,"



IS INACCURATE.



I AM NOT A GIRL.



I AM A WOMAN.



AND I REALLY
HATE THE WORD "SASSY."



IT'S STUPID.



- UH, GO IN TIGHT ON DALE.



- I MEAN, YES,
I HAVE AN ATTITUDE,



BUT WOULDN'T YOU,



IF YOU HAD TO LISTEN
TO DALE WATERS ALL DAY?



- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.



WE HAVE A REAL RESPONSIBILITY
TO DELIVER THE NEWS HERE--



- SHUT UP, DALE.



I AM NOT FINISHED.



YOU KNOW, THERE WAS A TIME
NOT TOO LONG AGO



WHERE YOU SAT HERE
AND APOLOGIZED FOR ME



AND MY BEHAVIOR.



AND NOW IT'S MY TURN.



- GO IN TIGHTER.



- I AM SORRY,



NOT FOR FREAKING OUT THEN
AND NOT FOR FREAKING OUT NOW,



BUT FOR SELLING OUT,
FOR COMING BACK HERE,



FOR EVEN CONSIDERING DATING
THIS HORRIBLY INADEQUATE MAN.



WHEN I--WHEN I GOT THE OFFER
TO COME BACK HERE,



I COMPROMISED ALL OF MY IDEALS,



AND I LEFT BEHIND THE ONLY
PEOPLE WHO STOOD BY ME.



THESE FRIENDS
WERE HONEST WITH ME



AND WANTED WHAT I SHOULD HAVE:



TO BE BETTER THAN I WAS.



THEY SAW ME AS MORE
THAN JUST A SASSY WEATHER GIRL,



AND I BLEW THEM OFF,



AND I RATIONALIZED IT ALL,



AND I AM ASHAMED OF MYSELF,



AND I'M SORRY.



DALE, YOU WERE RIGHT.



I NEVER LOVED YOU.



I MEAN, I LOVED THE IDEA OF YOU,



BUT THE TRUTH IS,
WE HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON.



- WELL, THAT WAS SUBTLE.



- WELL, THAT'S HOW I ROLL.



- SOME WOULD DESCRIBE IT
AS SASSY.



- OKAY, NO, IT'S--
NO.



- LIKE, I'M--
I'M PROUD OF YOU, YOU KNOW?



- THANK YOU.



- AND YOU CAN
CRASH WITH ME AGAIN,



YOU KNOW, NOW THAT YOU'RE
UNEMPLOYED AGAIN.



- YES, THAT WOULD BE GOOD.



I HAVE A HUGE SIGNING BONUS
TO REPAY.



I COULD USE A PLACE TO STAY
FOR A WHILE.



- GREAT.



YOU KNOW, YOU COULDN'T POSSIBLY
RUIN MY SOCIAL LIFE



ANY MORE THAN YOU ALREADY HAVE,
SO...



- YOU'RE A GOOD BROTHER.



- I'M JUST TRYING TO STOP YOU
FROM RUINING THE FAMILY NAME.



- COULD YOU HAVE ONE
SERIOUS MOMENT?



- NO.



- OKAY.



- OKAY.



- HEY.



- HEY.



UM, HI.



HEY, WALT.



- HEY, BYRON.



- OKAY, UH, SYLVIA,



I REALLY NEED TO TALK TO YOU,



AND IT'S KIND OF IMPORTANT



AND POTENTIALLY
VERY EMBARRASSING FOR ME, SO...



- HEY, I'LL JUST
WAIT OUTSIDE, THEN.



- GOOD.
THANK YOU.



- COOL.



- HI.



- HI, UM...



I'VE BEEN THINKING A LOT,
OKAY?



I'VE BEEN THINKING A LOT
ABOUT YOU AND ME,



AND I'M THINKING THAT I JUST
NEED TO COME OUT AND TELL YOU



HOW I FEEL ABOUT--



- I'M SORRY.



I WAS SUCH AN IDIOT.



LOOK, THE TRUTH IS,



I REALLY, REALLY,
REALLY LIKE YOU.



I DIDN'T MEAN TO,
BUT I DO.



AND YOU MEAN MORE TO ME
THAN A RICH GUY



OR A GROWN-UP GUY
OR A GUY WITH A JOB--



- I HAVE A JOB.



- NO, I KNOW YOU DO.



AND THAT'S NOT--



THE POINT IS, I--



YOU MEAN MORE TO ME
THAN ALL OF THOSE THINGS.



I THINK THAT, UM...



NO, I DO.



I LOVE YOU, OKAY?



I LOVE YOU.



WHAT DO YOU THINK?



- YOU--YOU FULLY JUST
STOLE MY MOMENT.



- WHAT?
- NO, I'M SERIOUS.



I WAS READY TO COME DOWN HERE



AND THROW ALL MY CHIPS
ON THE TABLE, YOU KNOW?



PREPARE TO GO DOWN
IN FLAMES,



AND THEN YOU GO AHEAD,
AND YOU STEAL THE WHOLE THING.



YOU MAKE THAT COOL--
COOL LITTLE SPEECH,



AND THEN I'M LEFT STANDING HERE
LIKE AN ASSHOLE.



- WELL, YOU COULD MAKE A SPEECH
IF YOU WANT.



- AND FOLLOW THAT?



THAT WAS A GREAT SPEECH.



I CAN'T FOLLOW THAT.



- SORRY.



- IT'S OKAY.



- SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?



- I KIND OF FEEL THE, UM--



I LOVE YOU TOO.



- YOU DO?



- YOU KNOW I DO.



NOW, LOOK,
I AM GOING TO GRAB YOU,



<i>AND I AM GOING TO KISS YOU.</i>



- OKAY.
- OKAY?



AND I AM GOING TO TAKE THE LEAD,



AND YOU ARE GONNA LET ME.



HERE IT COMES.



ALL RIGHT.



- YOU CAN DO THAT NOW.
- OKAY.



- IN ALL, 15 PEOPLES DIED
IN THAT HORRIBLE CRASH.



AND I'M SURE EVERYONE HERE
THINKS THAT--



THAT THAT IS TERRIBLE.



I MEAN, I'LL KEEP A THOUGHT
IN MY HEART



FOR, UH, THOSE POOR PEOPLE--
FAMILY.



- WHAT A PRICK.



GO TO COMMERCIAL.
